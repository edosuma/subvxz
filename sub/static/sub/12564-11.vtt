00:00.100 --> 00:02.278
Previously on Royal Pains...

00:05.334 --> 00:07.083
No, Divya's taking care
of me, so...

00:07.085 --> 00:09.135
you called six times to tell me

00:09.137 --> 00:10.420
you're drunk with Divya?

00:10.422 --> 00:11.921
No, of course not.
Divya's pregnant.

00:11.923 --> 00:14.424
She's not drinking
I am officially homeless.

00:14.426 --> 00:17.894
You could stay at my house.

00:17.896 --> 00:21.848
I got you these.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.966
- Thanks.
- Flak pills.

00:23.968 --> 00:26.069
- Ow! Ow! Ow.
- All right, stop, stop, stop.

00:26.071 --> 00:28.905
Can you give her something
for the pain?

00:28.907 --> 00:30.857
Molly, take one
of these hydrocodone.

00:30.859 --> 00:32.192
It'll help.
Turn around.

00:32.194 --> 00:34.361
Whoa, Molly! Molly!

00:36.615 --> 00:38.031
Dad?
Dad?

00:38.033 --> 00:40.083
The police want you to submit
to a tox screen.

00:40.085 --> 00:41.785
And I told them that wouldn't
be a problem.

00:41.787 --> 00:45.021
It isn't a problem, is it?
Of course not.

01:04.174 --> 01:06.025
Uh, he's developed
a low-grade fever

01:06.027 --> 01:07.527
over the past few hours.

01:07.529 --> 01:08.895
Yes, I know.

01:08.897 --> 01:10.513
But other than that,
his vitals are stable.

01:10.515 --> 01:12.649
And we're hopeful we can
get him off the ventilator.

01:12.651 --> 01:14.851
Yes.
I know.

01:14.853 --> 01:17.370
- And Molly's getting...
- Her wound redressed.

01:17.372 --> 01:19.205
I just came to give you this.

01:19.207 --> 01:20.540
Oh, uh...

01:20.542 --> 01:23.192
Dr. Shackleford said
you'd want it.

01:23.194 --> 01:27.697
- Why didn't she just call?
- That, I don't know.

01:54.942 --> 01:55.442
Evan?

02:04.752 --> 02:06.569
- Whoa.
- Hi, honey.

02:06.571 --> 02:07.570
- Hi.
- I brought you some...

02:07.572 --> 02:09.038
oh, coffee.
Thank God.

02:09.039 --> 02:12.625
- I've been jonesing for some.
- Oh, it's herbal tea.

02:12.627 --> 02:14.377
I thought you were
avoiding caffeine.

02:14.379 --> 02:15.628
I was.
I was.

02:15.630 --> 02:17.079
I-I fell off the wagon.

02:17.081 --> 02:18.598
- In Italy?
- Well, yeah.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.216
You know, it's...

02:20.218 --> 02:21.301
but herbal tea's
so much healthier.

02:21.303 --> 02:23.803
Thank you.
It's... this is great.

02:23.805 --> 02:28.308
Aw, yeah.
That's so lemony and zingy.

02:28.310 --> 02:30.026
- Is this my blouse?
- Yes, it is.

02:30.028 --> 02:31.361
I-I thought you wanted
to wear it today.

02:31.363 --> 02:33.429
So I was gonna
surprise you, but...

02:33.431 --> 02:35.097
oh, I was.

02:35.099 --> 02:37.266
Uh, but then I thought with
the heat and the long sleeves...

02:37.268 --> 02:38.267
- okay, that's fine.
- No, no, no.

02:38.269 --> 02:39.319
But it's such a nice blouse.

02:39.321 --> 02:42.939
And I-it's so wrinkle-free.

02:42.941 --> 02:45.458
I'm gonna put it on right now.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.610
Great, all right, I'm gonna
get some lemon for my tea.

02:47.612 --> 02:50.613
- Okay, great.
- Okay.

03:09.934 --> 03:11.684
We usually have breakfast
in the breakfast room.

03:11.686 --> 03:13.069
It's so beautiful out.

03:13.071 --> 03:14.821
I thought we could break
our morning routine.

03:14.823 --> 03:18.024
But it...
it's called the breakfast room.

03:18.026 --> 03:19.609
I have your oatmeal,
no cinnamon,

03:19.611 --> 03:21.811
water, no ice,

03:21.813 --> 03:25.698
and your orange juice
with pulp.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.700
The vesicles improve
antioxidant status.

03:27.702 --> 03:30.670
You don't say.

03:35.158 --> 03:38.327
Hm.

03:40.330 --> 03:41.664
Everything okay?

03:41.666 --> 03:43.850
Uh, I've been trying
to consult with a surgeon.

03:43.852 --> 03:45.334
But she keeps postponing.

03:45.336 --> 03:46.636
It's hard getting
a surgeon to focus

03:46.638 --> 03:48.354
when they're not cutting
into something.

03:48.356 --> 03:51.140
Sometimes, you have
to get creative.

03:51.142 --> 03:52.809
- Creative.
- Mm.

03:52.811 --> 03:55.361
Thank you.

03:55.363 --> 03:57.947
I couldn't help noticing
the flyer on the kitchen table

03:57.949 --> 03:59.148
for a lamaze class.

03:59.150 --> 04:01.034
Yes, I need to sign up.

04:01.036 --> 04:05.521
- Do you have a partner?
- I don't.

04:05.523 --> 04:07.991
I could be your partner.

04:07.993 --> 04:09.525
Well, that would be very nice.

04:09.527 --> 04:13.830
Thank you, Jeremiah.
You're welcome.

04:13.832 --> 04:15.531
- Could you pass the...
- Mmhmm.

04:15.533 --> 04:18.668
Hm.

04:22.874 --> 04:26.009
Hello?

04:37.771 --> 04:39.055
Hey.

04:39.057 --> 04:40.857
Hey, thanks
for coming over here.

04:40.859 --> 04:41.941
Yeah.

04:41.943 --> 04:43.443
The doctor's gonna take don

04:43.445 --> 04:45.612
off the ventilator so
I just wanna stay close by.

04:45.614 --> 04:48.281
He gonna be all right?

04:48.283 --> 04:49.782
- I hope so.
- Me too.

04:49.784 --> 04:51.918
Wow.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.337
How lucky is he
you were there to save him?

04:54.339 --> 04:56.906
Yeah, listen,
because I was driving

04:56.908 --> 04:59.125
and there was an accident,
they did a tox screen.

04:59.127 --> 05:00.259
Mine came back positive.

05:00.261 --> 05:03.546
As in you had drugs
in your system?

05:03.548 --> 05:05.765
Just pain medication
that was prescribed to me.

05:05.767 --> 05:06.766
It's nothing to worry about.

05:06.768 --> 05:07.884
I wasn't gonna worry.

05:07.886 --> 05:09.185
I'm a little surprised

05:09.187 --> 05:10.520
you've been on painkillers.

05:10.522 --> 05:12.922
Well I am still recovering
from my craniotomy.

05:12.924 --> 05:15.257
So did Divya prescribe them?

05:15.259 --> 05:17.226
Hank, may I speak
with your privately.

05:17.228 --> 05:18.895
Hello, Evan.
Hi.

05:18.897 --> 05:22.815
Wait a second, did Jeremiah
prescribe them?

05:22.817 --> 05:25.601
Yes, he did.

05:25.603 --> 05:26.869
Look, if it's about me
you're free

05:26.871 --> 05:28.037
to say anything
in front of Evan.

05:28.039 --> 05:30.073
Uh, okay.

05:30.075 --> 05:31.491
The police called to verify

05:31.493 --> 05:32.959
that I was
your prescribing physician.

05:32.961 --> 05:35.161
The police called
about the tox screening?

05:35.163 --> 05:37.880
I assured them that you were
titrating the hydrocodone,

05:37.882 --> 05:39.832
that I'd given you five pills
over a week ago,

05:39.834 --> 05:42.135
so I'd imagine you've been off
those for a few days,

05:42.137 --> 05:45.121
and as a result, negligible
would show up if any.

05:45.123 --> 05:46.339
Well, they did show up.

05:46.341 --> 05:49.726
His test came back positive.

05:49.728 --> 05:52.061
Look, I went through the pills
you gave me, Jeremiah.

05:52.063 --> 05:53.312
I'm still feeling some pain,

05:53.314 --> 05:57.984
so I, uh... I stopped into
a pain clinic and got some more.

05:57.986 --> 06:00.153
You saw another doctor?

06:00.155 --> 06:03.322
Yeah, it's not a big deal.

06:03.324 --> 06:05.324
How many pills have you taken?

06:05.326 --> 06:06.809
I'm only taking them
when I feel pain.

06:06.811 --> 06:09.746
Uh, one a day?
Sometimes two tops.

06:09.748 --> 06:11.364
Look, I need to go
check on don.

06:11.366 --> 06:13.032
For the record, I haven't
taken one since yesterday

06:13.034 --> 06:16.619
but if you guys
are so worried... There.

06:16.621 --> 06:18.204
Okay?

06:18.206 --> 06:20.206
All gone.

06:24.762 --> 06:29.716
The fourth key to success
in my book is focus.

06:29.718 --> 06:32.334
How do we tune out the noise?

06:32.336 --> 06:34.771
How do we tune out
those e-mails,

06:34.773 --> 06:36.222
the text, Twitter?

06:36.224 --> 06:37.724
All right,
that one is difficult.

06:37.726 --> 06:39.341
And our phones.

06:40.979 --> 06:44.363
And that is exactly what
I'm talking about.

06:44.365 --> 06:47.316
We are so attached
to our devices.

06:47.318 --> 06:50.536
We need to make contact
with the outside world

06:50.538 --> 06:52.038
at every moment.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.907
It doesn't allow us to be...
I think that's yours.

06:54.909 --> 06:57.910
In the moment.

07:00.030 --> 07:01.214
Oh.

07:01.216 --> 07:03.032
Okay, listen,
I have to take this.

07:03.034 --> 07:05.752
It's my son.
Hi, Evan.

07:05.754 --> 07:08.755
Everything okay?

07:10.557 --> 07:14.093
Don't go anywhere.
I am coming right over.

07:20.698 --> 07:21.931
You have no idea
how much it means to me

07:21.933 --> 07:23.116
you just dropping everything

07:23.118 --> 07:23.933
and coming out here like this.

07:23.935 --> 07:25.267
Are you kidding?

07:25.269 --> 07:27.320
Do you know how much
you and Hank mean to me?

07:27.322 --> 07:29.205
I'm just so happy
that my seminar

07:29.207 --> 07:30.439
was only a ferry ride away.

07:30.441 --> 07:31.624
Yeah, me too.

07:31.626 --> 07:33.076
God, I hope
I'm not overreacting.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.744
It's just Hank, pain-killers.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.796
It kinda sounds ridiculous
when you think about it.

07:36.798 --> 07:38.047
When it comes to addiction,

07:38.049 --> 07:39.549
there is no overreacting.

07:39.551 --> 07:40.783
Well, I didn't say
he was addicted.

07:40.785 --> 07:42.118
You cannot minimize.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.803
Things will just spin
outta control.

07:43.805 --> 07:45.505
I didn't say he was gonna
spin outta control either.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.056
You gotta nip it.
Trust me.

07:47.058 --> 07:49.142
I know from past experience
and here it is.

07:49.144 --> 07:52.979
You boys have
the genetic predisposition.

07:52.981 --> 07:55.148
Wait, you had problems?

07:55.150 --> 07:56.566
Have.

07:56.568 --> 07:58.134
It's never in the past tense.

07:58.136 --> 08:00.153
With what?

08:00.155 --> 08:02.822
Well, my problem
was never with substances.

08:02.824 --> 08:05.908
My addiction is
to embellishment.

08:05.910 --> 08:08.161
I'm sorry, what?

08:08.163 --> 08:11.364
Years ago, I had a tiny
problem with compulsive lying.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.482
See, there I go again
'cause it wasn't so tiny.

08:13.484 --> 08:15.084
Well, we all knew
you meant well.

08:15.086 --> 08:16.336
That's... that's not
a big deal.

08:16.338 --> 08:18.454
Don't sugarcoat it.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.541
When it comes to Hank,
we have to be ruthless.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.926
Okay.
Good.

08:23.928 --> 08:24.927
That's great.
Ruthless.

08:24.929 --> 08:26.596
You, me, help Hank, together.

08:26.598 --> 08:28.548
- You, me, and Lacy.
- Who?

08:28.550 --> 08:31.968
Lacy sinclair, former addict
turned sobriety guru.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.220
Look, when I got out of prison,

08:34.222 --> 08:35.638
I still had things to work out.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.106
And Lacy was there for me.

08:37.107 --> 08:39.859
So as soon as I got
your phone call I called her,

08:39.861 --> 08:41.309
she offered to help.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.696
So I booked the after party.

08:43.698 --> 08:45.347
- The what?
- The after party.

08:45.349 --> 08:48.368
That's Lacy's facility
right here in the Hamptons.

08:48.370 --> 08:49.819
Trust me.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.538
Eddie.
What a nice surprise.

08:52.540 --> 08:54.356
Hank is on drugs.
We're gonna help him.

08:55.526 --> 08:57.526
Dad.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.665
You're not kidding.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.717
Look, Hank has been
taking some pain-killers

09:04.719 --> 09:05.885
because of his surgery.

09:05.887 --> 09:06.886
No way.

09:06.888 --> 09:08.037
If Hank were
taking pain-killers,

09:08.039 --> 09:09.172
he would've told me.

09:09.174 --> 09:12.225
Well, he had Jeremiah
prescribe them.

09:12.227 --> 09:13.926
Eddie.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.011
When did you get here?

09:15.013 --> 09:16.562
As soon as I got Evan's call.

09:16.564 --> 09:18.898
And sweetie,
call me "dad."

09:18.900 --> 09:20.349
What are you doing here?

09:20.351 --> 09:22.101
So there's a bit
of a family emergency.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.653
- There is?
- Yeah.

09:23.655 --> 09:25.605
- Well, Hank's an add...
- Amazing person.

09:25.607 --> 09:28.941
He's an amazing person
who, unbeknownst to us,

09:28.943 --> 09:30.559
has been feeling some pain
since his surgery

09:30.561 --> 09:31.994
and apparently
he's been taking some meds

09:31.996 --> 09:33.279
to handle the pain.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.031
I still find this
hard to believe.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.916
Oh, my God.
Is he okay?

09:36.918 --> 09:38.201
Oh, he will be.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.869
I guarantee it.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.904
How didn't I know about this?

09:41.906 --> 09:44.040
Well, we all just found
about it this morning.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.291
But you didn't call me.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.127
Well, I knew you had
a busy day with Russel,

09:48.129 --> 09:49.128
so I didn't wanna interrupt.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.213
That's so sweet,

09:50.215 --> 09:51.881
but if someone
we love is in trouble,

09:51.883 --> 09:54.416
interrupt me.

09:54.418 --> 09:55.935
Well, that is so sweet.

09:55.937 --> 09:57.770
But I love you so I

09:57.772 --> 10:00.940
was trying to be supportive.

10:00.942 --> 10:03.976
- Enjoying your coffee?
- Yes.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.228
Nice blouse.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.814
Could we focus back on Hank?

10:07.816 --> 10:10.066
Could you lovebirds
stop arguing?

10:10.068 --> 10:11.651
- We weren't arguing.
- Not at all.

10:11.653 --> 10:12.652
- See?
- Good.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.820
Because we've gotta get over

10:13.822 --> 10:15.204
to the after party estate

10:15.206 --> 10:17.156
to plan Hank's intervention.

10:17.158 --> 10:21.210
Let's go.
All right.

10:21.212 --> 10:23.496
Intervention?
Seriously?

10:23.498 --> 10:24.664
I know it sounds
a little dramatic,

10:24.666 --> 10:26.165
but yeah, it's a...
Sorry.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.583
I can't join you for that.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.969
I'm going to find Hank
and speak with him directly.

10:29.971 --> 10:31.671
Divya, that is a great idea.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.924
You can lure him there.
Lure him?

10:34.926 --> 10:36.259
Yes, we have to surprise him.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.794
So you could make up
something about

10:38.796 --> 10:41.597
a-a complicated patient.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.466
Sanctioned lies do not count.
Got it.

10:44.468 --> 10:45.651
Hank doesn't need
an intervention.

10:45.653 --> 10:47.487
This is ludicrous.

10:47.489 --> 10:51.324
And I'm not luring him
anywhere.

10:51.326 --> 10:54.277
Let's go.
Come on.

11:07.341 --> 11:10.960
Just aced
the practice test, dad.

11:12.296 --> 11:15.497
Yeah.

11:15.499 --> 11:19.552
Mr. Lopez is gonna let me
make up the final.

11:22.505 --> 11:24.357
The ct confirmed
what we feared.

11:24.359 --> 11:27.193
Don has pneumonia,
hence his fever.

11:27.195 --> 11:28.311
Yeah, I was afraid he aspirated

11:28.313 --> 11:29.729
when I put in
the laryngeal mask.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.814
It's the risk you take
using a laryngeal mask

11:31.816 --> 11:34.033
instead of rapid-sequence
intubation.

11:34.035 --> 11:38.204
Well, hopefully, the
antibiotics will work quickly

11:38.206 --> 11:40.156
and we can get him off
the vent in a few hours.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.024
Slow down, cowboy.

11:42.026 --> 11:44.526
I'm more of a one-step-at-a-time
practitioner.

11:44.528 --> 11:47.363
And I'd like to look ahead.

11:47.365 --> 11:50.299
Dr. Shackleford
may have okayed you

11:50.301 --> 11:52.385
being involved in the case
as the doctor of record.

11:52.387 --> 11:55.087
But as the head of the icu,

11:55.089 --> 11:57.223
I'd like to get his fever
under control first

11:57.225 --> 12:00.009
and then go from there.

12:07.901 --> 12:12.021
Welcome to the after party.

12:12.023 --> 12:15.074
Keeping it real, Eddie?
Always, huh?

12:15.076 --> 12:17.743
Give me some sugar.
Mm.

12:17.745 --> 12:20.196
- Ha.
- All right, Evan, Paige,

12:20.198 --> 12:23.732
meet my saving grace,
Lacy sinclair.

12:23.734 --> 12:25.167
Hi.
Oh, no, I always hug...

12:25.169 --> 12:26.419
Okay.

12:26.421 --> 12:27.569
Especially since I feel
like I know you

12:27.571 --> 12:28.921
the way Eddie talks about you.

12:28.923 --> 12:31.090
- Really?
- He's my hero.

12:31.092 --> 12:32.792
- Aw.
- Hero?

12:32.794 --> 12:35.077
Never seen anyone go cold
Turkey on lying like he did.

12:35.079 --> 12:37.746
Well, you know,
I've had some minor relapses.

12:37.748 --> 12:40.299
- Temptation is everywhere.
- Yes.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.852
- Huh, so it seems.
- Oh, these?

12:42.854 --> 12:45.304
No, I would never have
bought booze this cheap.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.256
My most recent guest
snuck it in,

12:47.258 --> 12:48.975
hid them in the hedgerow.
Ah, hedgerow.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.426
They just weren't ready
to start fresh.

12:50.428 --> 12:53.095
Oh, think I spilled some on me.

12:53.097 --> 12:54.763
Ah, yeah.
It smells strong.

12:54.765 --> 12:57.599
So Lacy, how did you become
a sobriety guru?

12:57.601 --> 12:59.652
Well, you wake up in
the neighbor's vegetable garden

12:59.654 --> 13:01.070
enough times,
you start to wonder

13:01.072 --> 13:02.405
if there's not a better way
to make a salad.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.823
- Hm.
- Mm-hmm.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.291
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

13:05.293 --> 13:08.794
Um, so no offense
to you or any of this,

13:08.796 --> 13:11.664
but you really think
this is what Hank needs?

13:11.666 --> 13:13.282
- Mm-hmm.
- An intervention here?

13:13.284 --> 13:15.251
I don't
call them interventions.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.637
It just sounds
too confrontational for me.

13:17.639 --> 13:19.672
I call this
"an invitation."

13:19.674 --> 13:20.723
Oh, an invitation.

13:20.725 --> 13:21.841
As in you are invited

13:21.843 --> 13:23.676
to regain control of your life.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.145
Did I not tell you
that this woman was the best?

13:26.147 --> 13:27.647
Huh?

13:29.434 --> 13:32.234
My first intervention
was in a motel 6 conference room

13:32.236 --> 13:34.153
with cold coffee
and folding chairs.

13:34.155 --> 13:36.188
But sober doesn't have
to look like that.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.658
My life now
is still just as fun,

13:38.660 --> 13:40.526
but infinitely more fulfilling.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.445
And that's what I wanna share
with your brother.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.147
So come on, let's get
this after party started.

13:45.149 --> 13:46.315
Come on.

13:46.317 --> 13:48.317
- Thank you.
- Here we go.

13:56.326 --> 13:57.626
Dr. Jory.

13:57.628 --> 14:00.129
You've been avoiding my calls.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.881
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

14:01.883 --> 14:03.549
Dr. Jeremiah Sacani.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.000
Ah, Dr. Sacani.

14:05.002 --> 14:06.602
Well, I haven't been
avoiding you.

14:06.604 --> 14:08.137
I've had to postpone
a few times.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.855
If it was urgent,
I misunderstood.

14:09.857 --> 14:11.640
Well, Hank is still in pain.

14:11.642 --> 14:15.227
During his craniotomy,
did you perhaps violate his pia?

14:15.229 --> 14:16.228
What?

14:16.230 --> 14:17.530
During his craniotomy,

14:17.532 --> 14:18.864
did anything
out of the ordinary happen?

14:18.866 --> 14:19.865
Leaking? Plunging?

14:19.867 --> 14:20.866
I don't care to be grilled

14:20.868 --> 14:22.201
on my surgery technique.

14:22.203 --> 14:24.120
Well, 83% of your procedures
over the last 4 years

14:24.122 --> 14:25.121
have been back fusions.

14:25.123 --> 14:26.205
Meaning?

14:26.207 --> 14:27.540
You do far fewer craniotomies

14:27.542 --> 14:28.574
than the average neurosurgeon.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.042
But more than you.

14:30.044 --> 14:31.627
I simply want to determine

14:31.629 --> 14:34.663
if you caused my friend...
my patient to have a stroke.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.666
Have you seen
manual dexterity deficits?

14:37.668 --> 14:39.719
Aphasia?

14:39.721 --> 14:41.921
Nystagmus?

14:41.923 --> 14:43.055
Dysarthria?

14:43.057 --> 14:45.057
No, but there still could be...

14:45.059 --> 14:47.977
doesn't sound
like a stroke to me.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.184
Now, that sounds like a stroke.

15:07.030 --> 15:08.697
What are you doing?

15:08.699 --> 15:11.200
Turning down the sedation

15:11.202 --> 15:14.403
to activate your father's
respiratory drive.

15:14.405 --> 15:16.705
Your dad's fever
has stabilized.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.125
So we're gonna see if he's ready
to breathe on his own.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.127
Dr. Oren's turning down
the ventilator settings.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.579
So why are you here?

15:23.581 --> 15:25.431
I'm your dad's doctor.

15:25.433 --> 15:27.466
And I care about him.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.301
Look, Molly,
I know you're angry with me.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.687
But I promise I'm here
to do everything I can for him

15:31.689 --> 15:33.606
and for you.

15:33.608 --> 15:35.424
You gave me just one
of those pills.

15:35.426 --> 15:38.394
And I was totally zoned out.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.112
So how messed up were you

15:40.114 --> 15:44.116
when you were doing
everything you could for him?

15:45.903 --> 15:47.102
What... what's happening?

15:47.104 --> 15:49.205
Don? He... he's
over-breathing the vent.

15:49.207 --> 15:52.541
- We need sedatives on board!
- 100 of diprivan, please.

15:52.543 --> 15:55.444
It's okay.
Easy, don.

15:55.446 --> 15:59.081
Okay, good.
Thank you.

16:04.754 --> 16:07.339
Easy.
Easy.

16:07.341 --> 16:11.811
He's settling down.

16:11.813 --> 16:14.396
Doesn't look like
he's getting off today.

16:14.398 --> 16:15.764
If his lungs aren't ready,

16:15.766 --> 16:16.798
it's best we give his body
more time

16:16.800 --> 16:19.801
to fight off the infection.

16:23.074 --> 16:27.076
So... Why are you here?

16:47.052 --> 16:48.769
Uh, Dr. Oren.

16:48.771 --> 16:50.188
Oh, Dr. Lawson.

16:50.190 --> 16:51.355
I think Molly's
warming up to us.

16:51.357 --> 16:52.690
Yeah.

16:52.692 --> 16:54.442
- Buy you a coffee?
- Uh, no, thank you.

16:54.444 --> 16:57.445
Listen, you and I both know
every hour don's in a coma

16:57.447 --> 16:59.447
his prognosis gets worse.

16:59.449 --> 17:01.098
We need to be more aggressive.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.650
I wanna give him a course
of high-does steroids.

17:02.652 --> 17:04.234
Absolutely not.

17:04.237 --> 17:05.953
Look, I've prescribed him
steroids before

17:05.954 --> 17:07.405
and he's responded well.

17:07.406 --> 17:09.574
I imagine that was before
he was in a coma.

17:09.576 --> 17:13.777
I understand your concerns,
but I am don's doctor.

17:13.779 --> 17:17.781
So am I, and it's my icu.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.260
Hank.

17:29.262 --> 17:31.262
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:31.264 --> 17:33.431
Are you okay?

17:33.433 --> 17:36.767
Evan told you about
the tox screen.

17:36.769 --> 17:38.186
Look, there's nothing
to worry about, okay?

17:38.188 --> 17:40.154
I have a warranted prescription
and I wasn't impaired.

17:40.156 --> 17:42.273
Yes, Molly wanted the screening,

17:42.275 --> 17:44.692
but she's a scared, angry, kid
who's worried about her dad.

17:44.694 --> 17:45.809
What about your pain?

17:45.811 --> 17:48.279
I had brain surgery.

17:48.281 --> 17:50.331
Eight months ago and now
you are sweaty, and...

17:50.333 --> 17:52.816
I was outside
chasing down Dr. Oren.

17:52.818 --> 17:54.318
And interrupting me.

17:54.320 --> 17:58.789
Sorry. I'm sorry.

17:58.791 --> 18:01.042
Why did you keep this a secret?

18:01.044 --> 18:02.710
It wasn't a secret.

18:02.712 --> 18:03.794
It was personal.

18:03.796 --> 18:05.379
Now's not a good time.

18:05.381 --> 18:06.497
I have to get back to don.

18:06.499 --> 18:07.515
We'll talk later.

18:07.517 --> 18:08.999
Hank!

18:09.001 --> 18:10.718
You don't look like
you should be taking care

18:10.720 --> 18:13.020
of anyone but yourself.

18:13.022 --> 18:16.023
Now, when was the last time
you took a pill?

18:18.176 --> 18:20.511
I'm fine.

18:33.542 --> 18:37.194
Evan told me about
Hank's pain medicine.

18:37.196 --> 18:39.297
- You're concerned?
- Yes, I am.

18:39.299 --> 18:40.998
Have you ever heard of
post-craniotomy pain

18:41.000 --> 18:42.383
lasting eight months?

18:42.385 --> 18:44.502
I've discovered
a few rare cases.

18:44.504 --> 18:46.420
I should have started
investigating sooner.

18:46.422 --> 18:49.056
Pain management
is a nuanced field.

18:49.058 --> 18:50.708
He's worse today, I can tell.

18:50.710 --> 18:53.644
And Evan wants me to bring him
to see a patient at 4:00.

18:53.646 --> 18:54.679
I think he needs to rest.

18:54.681 --> 18:56.981
Did Evan say
who this patient is?

18:56.983 --> 18:58.683
Just that it
was a complicated case

18:58.685 --> 19:00.434
and that I should convince him
to leave the hospital for it.

19:00.436 --> 19:02.403
Hmm. I think
I know the patient

19:02.405 --> 19:05.239
that Evan is referring to.

19:05.241 --> 19:07.742
And, yes, it's important
that Hank is there.

19:07.744 --> 19:10.027
I need to go.

19:10.029 --> 19:13.698
Okay.

19:13.700 --> 19:16.417
Is she drunk?

19:16.419 --> 19:18.068
She's definitely something.

19:18.070 --> 19:19.069
Do you need help?

19:19.071 --> 19:20.371
No, I'm good.
Thanks.

19:20.373 --> 19:21.956
My new heels are killing me.

19:21.958 --> 19:24.842
Well, I have
the social lubricant.

19:24.844 --> 19:26.076
Fruit-infused water.

19:26.078 --> 19:27.878
Emotional outpourings
can be draining

19:27.880 --> 19:29.263
so hydration is key.

19:29.265 --> 19:30.881
The fruit just makes it fun.

19:30.883 --> 19:32.433
- It does.
- Yes.

19:32.435 --> 19:33.467
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

19:33.469 --> 19:35.603
Oh, this is Divya.

19:35.605 --> 19:36.971
Divya works with Hankmed.

19:36.973 --> 19:38.189
Hi, nice to meet you.

19:38.191 --> 19:39.223
Please join us.
Thank you.

19:39.225 --> 19:41.108
Hey.

19:41.110 --> 19:42.727
Why'd you change your mind?

19:42.729 --> 19:44.595
I'm here to help Hank

19:44.597 --> 19:47.231
and I'm reserving judgment
on this intervention.

19:47.233 --> 19:48.616
It's an invitation.

19:48.618 --> 19:51.769
- A what?
- An invitation.

19:51.771 --> 19:53.738
Thanks, Lacy.

19:53.740 --> 19:55.790
Oh, you know what, that's mine.

19:55.792 --> 19:57.274
Here, you take this one.

19:57.276 --> 20:00.294
- Oh, okay.
- Okay. Good.

20:00.296 --> 20:02.296
All right, so let's prepare
ourselves for Hank's arrival.

20:02.298 --> 20:08.469
Yeah, so we start
by communicating openly

20:08.471 --> 20:09.970
I call this stage mingling.

20:09.972 --> 20:13.007
You make a more significant
connection with another guest

20:13.009 --> 20:14.958
when you really
open yourselves up. Yeah?

20:14.960 --> 20:17.144
Okay. Eddie, would you like
to start us off?

20:17.146 --> 20:18.479
Sure.

20:18.481 --> 20:20.481
Hello, uh, my name is Eddie

20:20.483 --> 20:21.965
hi, Eddie.

20:21.967 --> 20:25.135
I know that an invitation is
probably more than Hank needs.

20:25.137 --> 20:27.488
I mean, he's not chasing
the dolphin here.

20:27.490 --> 20:29.306
Pretty sure
that's "dragon," dad.

20:29.308 --> 20:32.076
Yeah, well, what I wanna do
is nip it in the bud

20:32.078 --> 20:34.028
so he doesn't become
too much like his old man.

20:34.030 --> 20:36.614
Now, before I became
a renowned author...

20:36.616 --> 20:38.499
- Eddie.
- A published author,

20:38.501 --> 20:40.984
I was a convicted felon.

20:40.986 --> 20:42.670
Well, we all take detours.

20:42.672 --> 20:43.987
We do.

20:43.989 --> 20:45.623
Especially the Lawson men.

20:45.625 --> 20:49.543
Remember the problem that Hank
had with a hospital in Brooklyn?

20:49.545 --> 20:51.429
Then he moved out here
and everything just took off

20:51.431 --> 20:53.497
like a rocket?
Yes.

20:53.499 --> 20:56.016
And you, you always had
terrible trouble with women.

20:56.018 --> 20:58.636
You could never keep
a relationship going.

20:58.638 --> 21:00.671
Remember when you had
that thing for Divya

21:00.673 --> 21:02.005
and now look at you.

21:02.007 --> 21:05.008
All of a sudden you've got
this beautiful wife...

21:05.010 --> 21:06.527
I'm sorry.
You and Divya?

21:06.529 --> 21:07.812
No... What?
No.

21:07.814 --> 21:09.814
There w... there wasn't
any of me and Divya.

21:09.816 --> 21:11.065
Absolutely not.

21:11.067 --> 21:14.685
- Well, there was a small...
- Dad.

21:14.687 --> 21:16.404
Did anything ever happen?

21:16.406 --> 21:18.021
- No. No.
- No.

21:18.023 --> 21:20.991
Did you say a thing for Divya
or a thing with Divya?

21:20.993 --> 21:23.694
No, definitely for Divya.

21:23.696 --> 21:25.212
It was a small crush.

21:25.214 --> 21:26.464
Okay, the... no.

21:26.466 --> 21:27.698
No for, no with, no crush.

21:27.700 --> 21:28.749
Or... there was nothing.

21:28.751 --> 21:30.101
Less than nothing.

21:30.103 --> 21:32.219
I am not attracted
to Divya at all anymore.

21:32.221 --> 21:33.220
"Anymore?"

21:33.222 --> 21:34.588
So there was a for.

21:34.590 --> 21:36.474
Look, for one,
what... why would you do this?

21:40.713 --> 21:42.596
Lacy.

21:42.598 --> 21:44.548
Lacy.

21:44.550 --> 21:48.152
- Hey, you all right?
- What happened?

21:48.154 --> 21:50.187
Evan said it was
a complicated patient.

21:50.189 --> 21:51.188
He didn't say who.

21:51.190 --> 21:52.440
I can call him.

21:52.442 --> 21:54.191
Uh, look,
I really can't get away.

21:54.193 --> 21:55.192
Would you mind...

21:55.194 --> 21:56.243
help! Help my dad!

21:56.245 --> 22:00.364
He's in trouble.

22:00.366 --> 22:02.032
What is it?

22:02.034 --> 22:03.367
What is it... what's happening?

22:03.369 --> 22:06.587
Oh, he's okay.

22:06.589 --> 22:08.422
The pulse oximeter
slipped off his finger.

22:08.424 --> 22:10.174
It monitors blood oxygenation

22:10.176 --> 22:11.959
and when it stopped
the alarm sounded.

22:11.961 --> 22:14.128
But it's working now.

22:14.130 --> 22:16.464
He's okay.

22:41.363 --> 22:43.947
Evan, I am so very, very sorry.

22:43.949 --> 22:45.465
I thought everybody knew.

22:45.467 --> 22:47.134
Dad, there's nothing to know.

22:47.136 --> 22:48.285
That's why
I'm gonna talk to Paige.

22:48.287 --> 22:49.336
I'm gonna straighten
everything out.

22:49.338 --> 22:50.554
No, you're not.
No.

22:50.556 --> 22:51.555
Okay? I'll handle it.

22:51.557 --> 22:52.556
You wanna straighten someone out

22:52.558 --> 22:53.557
straighten out your friend,

22:53.559 --> 22:54.808
the drunk interventionist.

22:54.810 --> 22:56.977
- Invitationist.
- Whatever she is!

22:56.979 --> 22:58.628
And just because Lacy
is a recovering addict

22:58.630 --> 22:59.846
doesn't mean that she's a drunk.

22:59.848 --> 23:01.631
Can we look
at the facts for a second?

23:01.633 --> 23:03.100
- Sure.
- One, she could barely

23:03.102 --> 23:04.484
- carry the tray.
- Mmhmm.

23:04.486 --> 23:06.236
Okay?
Two, she insisted on drinking

23:06.238 --> 23:07.771
from a specific glass,

23:07.773 --> 23:09.690
and three, she fell
into her own pool.

23:09.692 --> 23:11.808
There is an explanation
for all of that.

23:11.810 --> 23:14.244
I'm gonna find out what it is
and bring it back to you.

23:14.246 --> 23:16.496
Lacy is clean.

23:16.498 --> 23:19.082
Trust me.

23:29.344 --> 23:33.663
Look, I'm not
attracted to Divya.

23:33.665 --> 23:36.350
So there's
nothing to talk about.

23:36.352 --> 23:39.353
- It's exactly what I'm saying.
- Good.

23:45.343 --> 23:47.778
How you doing?

23:47.780 --> 23:51.064
Other than my ego, I'm dandy.

23:51.066 --> 23:55.569
Okay, look,
I've got to ask you this.

23:56.654 --> 23:58.822
Are you using again?

23:58.824 --> 24:02.242
Eddie, I fell
because I got a little wobbly.

24:02.244 --> 24:03.327
- Mm-hmm.
- Trust me.

24:03.329 --> 24:04.411
I know the difference.

24:04.413 --> 24:05.362
You told me you fell

24:05.364 --> 24:06.363
because you weren't watching

24:06.365 --> 24:07.881
where you were going.

24:07.883 --> 24:13.387
Yes and, I mean, I have felt
a little unbalanced lately.

24:13.389 --> 24:15.589
In fact, I took a tumble
on my deck last week.

24:15.591 --> 24:18.875
And I wasn't using then either.

24:18.877 --> 24:19.876
Have your falls
been precipitated

24:19.878 --> 24:21.094
by any other symptoms?

24:21.096 --> 24:24.314
Some dry mouth and...

24:24.316 --> 24:27.601
I mean, I have been spaced out
and disoriented at times.

24:27.603 --> 24:29.569
- Have you seen a doctor?
- No.

24:29.571 --> 24:32.222
Doctors just wanna give you
pills, and I won't take them.

24:32.224 --> 24:34.775
The strongest thing I'll put
in my system now is aspirin.

24:34.777 --> 24:36.410
Why do you take aspirin?

24:36.412 --> 24:37.894
It just helps
with some occasional pain

24:37.896 --> 24:39.329
I have in my side.

24:39.331 --> 24:40.697
So when was the last time
you took aspirin?

24:40.699 --> 24:42.899
Well, today when I
was passing out the drinks.

24:42.901 --> 24:44.418
I dissolve mine in water.

24:44.420 --> 24:46.903
Even the action of popping pills
is something I want no part of.

24:46.905 --> 24:49.289
And that's why you didn't
want Evan to take your drink.

24:49.291 --> 24:50.707
Exactly.

24:50.709 --> 24:53.677
I just chalk up
the dry mouth and wobbliness

24:53.679 --> 24:55.912
to the damage I did
to my system when I was using.

24:55.914 --> 24:59.599
You should know I was a pretty
experimental chick back then.

24:59.601 --> 25:01.268
How "pretty experimental?"

25:01.270 --> 25:05.722
Coke, pot, pills,
shrooms, bananadine.

25:05.724 --> 25:07.524
Why don't I take some blood
just to be on the safe side?

25:07.526 --> 25:08.608
Good idea.

25:08.610 --> 25:09.776
And I'll take it right over

25:09.778 --> 25:10.927
to the hospital
for some analysis.

25:10.929 --> 25:13.096
No, you stay.
I'll send someone.

25:13.098 --> 25:17.534
We have too much work
to do preparing for Hank.

25:17.536 --> 25:21.538
One thing we cannot have
is distractions.

25:37.138 --> 25:39.890
Hi.

25:39.892 --> 25:42.459
I thought you could use some
clean clothes and a shower.

25:42.461 --> 25:44.061
I borrowed some scrubs for you.

25:44.063 --> 25:45.896
Sorry if you
don't like the smell.

25:45.898 --> 25:48.432
Molly, I know you wanna
take care of your dad,

25:48.434 --> 25:50.350
but you won't be able to if you
don't take care of yourself.

25:50.352 --> 25:52.185
I can sit with him
till you get back.

25:52.187 --> 25:53.987
We'll take shifts.

25:53.989 --> 25:56.073
Fine.

25:56.075 --> 25:57.441
We'll take shifts.

25:57.443 --> 25:58.859
Mine's not finished.

25:58.861 --> 26:03.163
- Listen, you need to k...
- He's my dad.

26:03.165 --> 26:06.500
Don't you have
a family of your own?

26:07.752 --> 26:11.088
Or at least other patients?

26:14.208 --> 26:17.544
By the way, a shower wouldn't
hurt you either.

26:19.465 --> 26:21.465
Okay.

26:25.970 --> 26:28.805
We're not having problems, so
there's nothing to talk about.

26:28.807 --> 26:30.173
So why are we
talking about this?

26:30.175 --> 26:31.441
We're here for Hank, right?

26:31.443 --> 26:33.143
Yes, but we can't
invite Hank here

26:33.145 --> 26:35.812
to fight his problems if we're
fighting amongst ourselves.

26:35.814 --> 26:37.147
- Well said, Eddie.
- Thank you.

26:37.149 --> 26:38.315
And why not talk about it?

26:38.317 --> 26:39.533
Are you hiding something?

26:39.535 --> 26:40.534
Of course not.

26:40.536 --> 26:42.352
So tell me, what happened?

26:42.354 --> 26:45.038
Nothing!

26:45.040 --> 26:46.406
Paige, I think
it's called chemistry.

26:46.408 --> 26:47.741
Yes, it's chemistry.

26:47.743 --> 26:48.658
Okay, chemistry
is so much worse.

26:48.660 --> 26:49.743
Then not that.

26:49.745 --> 26:50.877
Can I jump in here?

26:50.879 --> 26:52.546
- Of course, Divya.
- Thank you.

26:52.548 --> 26:55.081
Chemistry requires two sides

26:55.083 --> 26:56.633
and in this particular matter,

26:56.635 --> 26:59.886
there was only one ever.
True.

26:59.888 --> 27:01.421
Who'd hit on
anything with a pulse.

27:01.423 --> 27:04.674
That is entirely not true,
Divya, but thanks a lot.

27:04.676 --> 27:05.892
Paige, let me
ask you a question.

27:05.894 --> 27:08.512
Haven't we all
had previous relationships?

27:08.514 --> 27:10.147
It was not a relationship.

27:10.149 --> 27:11.898
Stop answering together!

27:11.900 --> 27:13.567
Paige, why should
feelings that Evan had

27:13.569 --> 27:16.603
long before he ever met you
matter so much?

27:16.605 --> 27:19.573
You guys have been spending
so much time together,

27:19.575 --> 27:21.074
and I see you two.

27:21.076 --> 27:22.609
You have fun with each other.

27:22.611 --> 27:23.743
Yeah, as friends.

27:23.745 --> 27:24.945
Paige.

27:24.947 --> 27:27.864
I have never
been attracted to Evan.

27:27.866 --> 27:30.900
In fact, sometimes I find him
crass, offensive, and vile.

27:30.902 --> 27:32.369
That is my husband
you're talking about.

27:32.371 --> 27:33.903
- Thank you, honey.
- Oh, don't you honey me.

27:33.905 --> 27:36.590
- Wha...
- Hello, everybody.

27:36.592 --> 27:37.907
What's going on?

27:37.909 --> 27:40.243
Dad?
Hello, Hank.

27:40.245 --> 27:42.128
Uh, this is Lacy.
Hi.

27:42.130 --> 27:44.047
- Hello.
- Are you the patient?

27:44.049 --> 27:46.850
No.
Welcome to the after party.

27:46.852 --> 27:48.218
To the what now?

27:48.220 --> 27:50.220
Kiddo, have a seat.

27:50.222 --> 27:52.439
Wait, I'm sorry.

27:52.441 --> 27:53.773
Why are you all here?

27:53.775 --> 27:56.109
You know what,
that is a really great question

27:56.111 --> 27:57.894
and just before I answer it,

27:57.896 --> 28:00.730
let me just say,
every single person here

28:00.732 --> 28:02.599
is loving you like crazy.

28:02.601 --> 28:04.568
- Are you?
- Mm-hmm.

28:04.570 --> 28:07.937
- There is no patient?
- No.

28:07.939 --> 28:08.955
This is an intervention.

28:08.957 --> 28:10.657
Invitation.

28:10.659 --> 28:11.791
That's what Lacy calls it.

28:11.793 --> 28:13.960
I didn't know.

28:13.962 --> 28:15.996
Yeah, you and me both.

28:15.998 --> 28:19.666
Uh, no offense, but I'm gonna
have to decline the invitation.

28:19.668 --> 28:22.118
Okay, look, it doesn't matter
what it's called.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.304
We're all here to talk.

28:24.306 --> 28:26.089
And find out some things.

28:26.091 --> 28:28.808
I'm happy to talk, but I don't
need whatever this is.

28:28.810 --> 28:30.427
Yes, but we're all here now,

28:30.429 --> 28:32.012
so just give it,
like, a few minutes.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.346
Why?

28:33.348 --> 28:34.347
You tricked me into coming here

28:34.349 --> 28:35.765
when I don't have a problem.

28:35.767 --> 28:37.183
But I do
have a patient in the icu.

28:37.185 --> 28:38.518
- No, just...
- No. Let go.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.986
- Not until you sit down.
- No, I'm not staying.

28:39.988 --> 28:41.104
- Yes, you are staying.
- No, I'm...

28:41.106 --> 28:42.606
- no.
- Let go. I'm not staying here.

28:42.608 --> 28:43.607
- Yes, you are.
- No. Let go.

28:43.609 --> 28:44.609
- I'm not having...
- Boys.

28:44.610 --> 28:45.909
Boys, stop it!

28:45.911 --> 28:48.078
Sit down for two sec...

28:48.080 --> 28:50.664
What?
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

28:50.666 --> 28:52.315
- What is it?
- My arm.

28:52.317 --> 28:54.618
It's radiating pain shooting
down from my neck.

28:54.620 --> 28:56.670
Has this happened before?

28:56.672 --> 28:58.672
I felt pain in my neck and
shoulder, but never my arm.

28:58.674 --> 29:00.206
But you were taking
the pain medication.

29:00.208 --> 29:02.259
So even if this was going on,
it could have been masked.

29:03.679 --> 29:05.879
Okay, okay.
Now it's better.

29:05.881 --> 29:07.497
This is radicular pain.

29:07.499 --> 29:09.832
What's that?
Is that a bad thing?

29:09.834 --> 29:12.602
It's radiating pain caused by
inflammation around the nerve

29:12.604 --> 29:14.271
coming from his spinal cord.

29:14.273 --> 29:16.139
Have you had any falls
since your surgery?

29:16.141 --> 29:17.390
No.

29:17.392 --> 29:19.476
What would happen
if he had one before?

29:19.478 --> 29:20.810
You fell off that barstool.

29:20.812 --> 29:23.396
- What barstool?
- At Evan and Paige's wedding.

29:23.398 --> 29:27.117
Maybe all this time you have
been misinterpreting

29:27.119 --> 29:28.735
radicular pain
as post-surgical pain.

29:28.737 --> 29:31.288
It would explain why this
hasn't gotten any better

29:31.290 --> 29:33.406
and why you felt the need
for ongoing pain medication.

29:33.408 --> 29:34.574
And if it is radicular...

29:34.576 --> 29:35.659
well, then we can
do something about it.

29:35.661 --> 29:37.077
Like what?
Like fix it?

29:37.079 --> 29:39.212
Yeah, but first
I need to get an mri.

29:39.214 --> 29:42.432
And so what are we waiting for?

29:44.956 --> 29:46.672
This holographic image
of your neck

29:46.674 --> 29:49.675
shows the damage
to your vertebrae.

29:55.848 --> 29:58.400
Well, your CT myelogram and
follow up MRIs both confirm...

29:58.402 --> 30:00.235
a c6 radiculopathy.
I can't believe it.

30:00.237 --> 30:02.070
All this time
right under my nose.

30:02.072 --> 30:03.622
And your neurosurgeon
wouldn't have found it

30:03.624 --> 30:06.208
on either your pre or
post-operative craniotomy MRIs

30:06.210 --> 30:07.409
because it is too low
on your neck.

30:07.411 --> 30:08.710
Right.

30:08.712 --> 30:10.162
Dr. Lawson, I'm about ready

30:10.164 --> 30:11.863
for the translaminar
corticosteroid injection.

30:11.865 --> 30:13.865
Okay.
Thank you.

30:13.867 --> 30:16.034
Hopefully this will reduce
the nerve route inflammation.

30:16.036 --> 30:17.386
Although, it's possible
you may need another.

30:17.388 --> 30:19.554
It's possible
I'll need surgery too.

30:19.556 --> 30:22.224
We'll have to see
how I feel after the injection.

30:22.226 --> 30:24.893
Hank, I owe you an apology.

30:24.895 --> 30:26.928
Why?

30:26.930 --> 30:28.546
It took me so long
to find this answer

30:28.548 --> 30:29.731
and it was
such a simple answer.

30:29.733 --> 30:31.883
I caused you weeks
of unnecessary pain.

30:31.885 --> 30:33.902
Oh, please, that's my fault.

30:33.904 --> 30:35.553
It's hard to make a diagnosis

30:35.555 --> 30:36.738
when your patient's
an uncooperative

30:36.740 --> 30:39.941
pain in the... Neck.

30:39.943 --> 30:43.862
I'm sorry.

30:43.864 --> 30:44.946
Okay, Dr. Lawson.

30:44.948 --> 30:47.399
Let's have you lay down.
Okay.

30:47.401 --> 30:50.068
See you on the other side.

31:20.433 --> 31:23.235
Turns out your blood work
came back negative

31:23.237 --> 31:26.604
for all the usual suspects of
past alcohol and drug abuse,

31:26.606 --> 31:28.740
but positive for low hemoglobin.

31:28.742 --> 31:30.442
I have no idea what the means.

31:30.444 --> 31:32.210
It means no cause for alarm.

31:32.212 --> 31:34.413
But while we're here
I'd like to run some tests

31:34.415 --> 31:35.964
for possible causes of anemia.

31:35.966 --> 31:39.134
Okay, would any of those
causes make my stomach hurt?

31:39.136 --> 31:42.287
Hey, so dad and Paige
are already in there.

31:42.289 --> 31:44.122
Jeremiah sent some cryptic text

31:44.124 --> 31:46.458
that it's Hank's c6
that's radicular.

31:46.460 --> 31:47.676
What does that mean?
Is that good or bad?

31:47.678 --> 31:50.645
That means Hank can be treated.

31:50.647 --> 31:54.433
Oh, my God, Divya,
that's great.

31:54.435 --> 31:56.184
Good stuff.

31:56.186 --> 31:57.319
I'm so sorry.
Oh.

31:57.321 --> 31:58.687
I'm so sorry I didn't believe

31:58.689 --> 32:00.021
in your "let's have
a party" technique

32:00.023 --> 32:01.523
'cause it worked.
It worked like a charm.

32:01.525 --> 32:03.275
I mean, in a roundabout
kind of way, but it...

32:05.612 --> 32:06.795
Is that what I think it is?

32:06.797 --> 32:08.130
Because I can't think
of anything worse.

32:08.132 --> 32:09.164
Lacy, you vomited blood.
Come here.

32:09.166 --> 32:10.582
Oh, blood.
Oh.

32:10.584 --> 32:12.283
That's worse.

32:12.285 --> 32:14.336
Lacy, I think the pain
that you described earlier

32:14.338 --> 32:15.954
may be coming from an ulcer,

32:15.956 --> 32:17.672
which would explain
why your hemoglobin is low.

32:17.674 --> 32:19.257
We need to stop the bleeding.

32:19.259 --> 32:20.842
Yes, you stop the bleeding.
I'm gonna get a clean shirt.

32:20.844 --> 32:22.511
Oh, I'm so sorry, Evan.

32:22.513 --> 32:27.599
No, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
you vomited... Warm blood.

32:27.601 --> 32:29.818
Would an ulcer cause falling
and light-headedness?

32:29.820 --> 32:31.820
No.

32:34.574 --> 32:37.492
Lacy, you said
that you only take aspirin.

32:37.494 --> 32:39.361
- Right.
- How much?

32:39.363 --> 32:40.996
I don't know, six, eight a day?

32:40.998 --> 32:45.000
Lacy, you have
aspirin poisoning.

32:47.503 --> 32:49.654
I was just trying
to treat myself

32:49.656 --> 32:51.206
without having to look
at a prescription bottle

32:51.208 --> 32:52.791
in my cabinet.

32:52.793 --> 32:55.460
A different pill, while
it may have triggered memories

32:55.462 --> 32:57.963
of addiction, would have treated
your ulcer properly.

32:57.965 --> 32:59.548
But don't worry.

32:59.550 --> 33:02.300
Some h-2 blockers and going
cold Turkey on the aspirin

33:02.302 --> 33:03.301
will take care of it.

33:03.303 --> 33:07.305
Let's get you inside.
Yeah.

33:11.177 --> 33:13.278
Hank is outside.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.846
How's Lacy?

33:14.848 --> 33:16.648
The gastroscopy stopped
the bleeding in her stomach.

33:16.650 --> 33:18.200
She'll be able to go home
first thing in the morning.

33:18.202 --> 33:19.985
Thank goodness.

33:19.987 --> 33:23.021
Okay, Divya.

33:23.023 --> 33:25.574
I feel horrible
about exposing the history

33:25.576 --> 33:26.575
between you and Evan.

33:26.577 --> 33:29.044
- Eddie.
- Yeah?

33:29.046 --> 33:31.696
- There was no history wi...
- Divya?

33:31.698 --> 33:34.549
What happens between two people
should remain private.

33:34.551 --> 33:38.553
I'm down with that.
Ugh.

33:42.041 --> 33:44.375
Well, what a wonderful day
this turned out to be.

33:48.348 --> 33:51.349
I wanted to apologize for a
insulting your husband before.

33:51.351 --> 33:54.686
I hope you know that I would
never intervene, intercede,

33:54.688 --> 33:56.438
inter-anything
with the two of you.

33:56.440 --> 33:59.024
It's not who I am, and...

33:59.026 --> 34:01.576
You are both way too important
to me as friends.

34:01.578 --> 34:03.078
As family.

34:03.080 --> 34:06.081
Thank you.

34:06.083 --> 34:08.500
I suppose I got jealous

34:08.502 --> 34:10.918
because things aren't
really going so well,

34:10.920 --> 34:12.954
and I needed someone to blame.

34:12.956 --> 34:17.408
Well, I'm here
if you ever need to talk.

34:17.409 --> 34:20.245
Hank, you look like
a million dollars.

34:20.246 --> 34:21.913
You look so much better.

34:21.915 --> 34:23.431
Yes, the single injection
was effective.

34:23.433 --> 34:25.250
Well, thank goodness.

34:25.252 --> 34:27.768
I have to admit,
it's been a difficult day.

34:27.771 --> 34:29.254
Difficult year, actually.

34:29.255 --> 34:30.272
I wish we'd known.

34:30.274 --> 34:31.606
We could have done more for you.

34:31.608 --> 34:33.925
I know, but even though
I didn't ask,

34:33.927 --> 34:35.310
you were all there
for me anyway.

34:35.312 --> 34:37.312
Well, yeah, that's what
family's for, Henry.

34:37.313 --> 34:39.864
Amen to that.

34:39.867 --> 34:41.449
I'm sorry I worried you all.

34:41.451 --> 34:43.201
I'm sorry I kept this secret.

34:43.203 --> 34:44.619
I should never have tried
to do this on my own,

34:44.621 --> 34:47.121
and I will never
make that mistake again.

34:47.123 --> 34:48.989
A few more weeks on those meds,

34:48.992 --> 34:50.574
I may have needed
an intervention.

34:50.577 --> 34:54.279
I mean an invitation.
Oh, yeah.

34:54.281 --> 34:59.284
I, uh... I love you guys.

35:01.137 --> 35:02.754
We love you too.

35:02.756 --> 35:04.973
Amen again.

35:04.975 --> 35:06.007
We love you, Hank.

35:06.009 --> 35:07.475
- Oh.
- Yes, we do.

35:07.477 --> 35:09.294
- Oh, wow.
- It's a group hug.

35:09.296 --> 35:10.762
- It's a group hug.
- Ow. Okay.

35:10.764 --> 35:12.630
Okay.
Enough.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.132
I have to get back
to my patient.

35:14.134 --> 35:16.818
He's been waiting all day
for me... To be me.

35:16.820 --> 35:18.270
I'll see you back
at the guesthouse.

35:18.272 --> 35:21.356
I'll walk inside with you.

35:21.358 --> 35:25.694
Back to helping patients, just
like the super doctor you are.

35:29.782 --> 35:31.866
Okay.

35:31.868 --> 35:34.953
So, Jeremiah, what a pleasure
to finally meet you.

35:34.955 --> 35:37.038
We met last summer
at the staff meeting.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.040
- Oh.
- At the guesthouse?

35:39.042 --> 35:40.208
Huh.

35:40.210 --> 35:41.760
Paige baked muffins.

35:41.762 --> 35:44.129
You know what, I think we
should ride together.

35:44.131 --> 35:47.665
Yes, that way we can
get better acquainted.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.634
- Uh, if you say so.
- Uh-huh.

35:49.636 --> 35:52.470
You know, chapter 16 in my book
is all about relaxing.

35:52.472 --> 35:53.805
- Mm-hmm?
- Yeah.

35:53.807 --> 35:58.443
You know you have nothing
to worry about, right?

35:58.445 --> 36:02.364
Paige, I love you.

36:02.366 --> 36:04.015
No one else but you.

36:04.017 --> 36:06.484
I've never loved anybody

36:06.486 --> 36:09.621
even close to as much
as I love you.

36:15.328 --> 36:17.796
I don't know why
I got so upset.

36:17.798 --> 36:21.366
I guess it's because you
and Divya get along so well.

36:21.368 --> 36:22.968
Yeah, we do.

36:22.970 --> 36:24.535
As friends.

36:24.537 --> 36:27.505
I promise that crush
was over a long time ago.

36:27.507 --> 36:28.673
Wasn't even a crush anyway.

36:28.675 --> 36:30.508
It wasn't like Jeremiah
and Divya.

36:30.510 --> 36:31.926
When I met...
Jeremiah and Divya?

36:31.928 --> 36:33.211
Oh, yeah.

36:33.213 --> 36:35.046
Jeremiah's completely
in love with Divya.

36:35.048 --> 36:36.931
Didn't I tell you that?
No.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.933
Yep.
Since last summer.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.318
Head over heels.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.320
Divya has no idea.

36:51.027 --> 36:53.579
Okay, have you put up
the hydrocortisone?

36:53.581 --> 36:56.081
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.867
Thank you.

36:57.869 --> 36:59.835
What's happening?

36:59.837 --> 37:03.155
I'm gonna treat your dad with
a course of high-dose steroids.

37:03.157 --> 37:04.823
Why?
Is he getting worse?

37:04.825 --> 37:05.824
Nope, there's been no change.

37:05.826 --> 37:06.959
I told Dr. Oren I wanna try

37:06.961 --> 37:07.960
to get him off the ventilator.

37:07.962 --> 37:09.428
I'm hoping a more aggressive

37:09.430 --> 37:10.996
course of treatment can do that.

37:10.998 --> 37:13.215
Instead of
just sitting and waiting,

37:13.217 --> 37:16.518
I wanna make your dad better.

37:16.520 --> 37:17.520
I wanna help him wake up.

37:31.484 --> 37:33.685
I guess it's my turn for break.

37:33.687 --> 37:35.687
Okay.

38:14.194 --> 38:16.195
Jeremiah.

38:20.951 --> 38:22.734
I was gonna pick up Indian food

38:22.736 --> 38:24.453
because I thought
you might like it.

38:24.455 --> 38:27.790
But then I thought
that might be offensive.

38:27.792 --> 38:31.794
And I know how much
you enjoy Italian cuisine.

38:33.847 --> 38:35.714
That's very kind.

38:35.716 --> 38:37.516
It's such a beautiful night,

38:37.518 --> 38:39.101
I thought we might
have dinner outside.

38:39.103 --> 38:43.105
The candles
are insect repellant

38:43.107 --> 38:44.857
and then we can review
the research I did

38:44.859 --> 38:46.275
for our lamaze class.

38:46.277 --> 38:50.095
Then maybe get a head start on
practicing breathing techniques.

38:50.097 --> 38:51.430
After we digest our food.

38:51.432 --> 38:53.932
Funny thing, Jeremiah.

38:53.934 --> 38:58.787
It turns out that I don't need
to attend this particular class

38:58.789 --> 39:01.273
until closer
to my delivery date.

39:01.275 --> 39:03.993
Oh, I'll keep
the materials then.

39:03.995 --> 39:05.661
My mother
should be back by then.

39:05.663 --> 39:07.779
She'll probably
want to be my partner.

39:07.781 --> 39:10.115
But thank you, Jeremiah.

39:10.117 --> 39:14.119
Of course, I'm... I'm sure
she would wanna do that.

39:15.839 --> 39:19.508
Also... My landlord called.

39:19.510 --> 39:24.463
And it seems my apartment
will be ready soon.

39:24.465 --> 39:26.398
So I'll finally
be able to move back home

39:26.400 --> 39:29.401
and be out of your hair.

39:32.939 --> 39:35.941
- That's great news.
- Huh.

39:39.529 --> 39:42.531
I'll go wash up then?

39:53.259 --> 39:55.544
- Dad?
- Yeah.

39:55.546 --> 39:57.846
To you.

39:57.848 --> 40:01.833
You show up and somehow
everything seems to work out.

40:01.835 --> 40:04.836
It's a talent.

40:04.838 --> 40:06.188
Seriously though, thank you.

40:06.190 --> 40:08.507
Thanks for showing up
when we needed you.

40:08.509 --> 40:11.693
Like I would be anywhere else.

40:11.695 --> 40:17.399
Also, um... I know a lot of
recovery is about forgiveness.

40:17.401 --> 40:24.406
So I just wanted to say...
I forgive you for everything.

40:25.708 --> 40:28.160
'Cause all
the things you've done,

40:28.162 --> 40:32.664
fighting to get your life back,
fighting to get us back,

40:32.666 --> 40:34.383
I'm sure none of that was easy.

40:34.385 --> 40:36.368
And I apologize to you

40:36.370 --> 40:40.422
if I created any tension
between you and Paige.

40:40.424 --> 40:41.873
No.

40:41.875 --> 40:46.512
No... I mean, you completely did,
but we worked everything out.

40:46.514 --> 40:48.046
Everything?

40:48.048 --> 40:51.100
That's wonderful for you.
Ev... that's great.

40:51.102 --> 40:54.603
Okay, maybe not everything.

40:54.605 --> 40:59.108
Trust me, Evan,
marriage is hard work.

41:02.028 --> 41:04.530
Yeah, I'm learning that.

41:04.532 --> 41:07.916
But it's better.

41:07.918 --> 41:10.369
Especially since the whole Divya
misunderstanding's over with.

41:10.371 --> 41:12.921

41:12.923 --> 41:14.206
All right,
so you both understand

41:14.208 --> 41:15.674
that Divya's not the problem?

41:15.676 --> 41:19.428
That is wonderful.

41:19.430 --> 41:22.431
But what do you think
the problem is?

41:44.238 --> 41:45.487
He's crashing.

41:45.489 --> 41:47.072
I need a triple lumen kit.

Somebody flush the cords.

Levophed drip.

What's happening to him?

42:03.674 --> 42:05.624
Inserting the guide wire.

42:05.626 --> 42:08.793
Running a bolus of two liters
