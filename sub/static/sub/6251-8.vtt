It’s a buyer’s market,
so this place is a steal.

00:08.426 --> 00:10.587
And the owner’s wife died,
so he is motivated.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.420
I’d be surprised
if another agent
doesn’t already have an offer.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.425
What’s that smell?

00:15.516 --> 00:17.757
It’s probably
the neighbors.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.843
I hear they love
to barbecue.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.893
It’s a very friendly

and all new carpeting.

Crap.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.671
I thought your grandfather
lived in a nursing home.

00:56.766 --> 01:00.054
It’s a retirement community.
It’s not a prison. He can leave
anytime that he wants.

01:00.144 --> 01:02.351
I think it’s nice
he wants to stay
with you for a while.

01:02.438 --> 01:04.099
Did something happen
in the nursing home?

just gonna read into it
and all sorts of stuff.

He slugged a nurse.

a cigar in his room.
- A cigar?

That’s interesting.
No, it’s not.
He’s a tough guy. That’s all.

in a nursing home
for a reason.

Oh, Pops. He had triple
bypass surgery about, oh,
I’d say three months ago.

to make it permanent?
He’s family, Bones.

talking about here—
spontaneous combustion?

- There’s no such thing.
- Come on, Bones.
Electrical currents in your body.

And then before you know it—
whoosh! Flame on.

05:59.985 --> 06:03.352
Well, the so-called instances
of spontaneous combustion...

06:03.447 --> 06:06.985

by a phenomenon known
as the wick effect.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.582
the pajamas being the wick.

06:24.677 --> 06:28.010
Fat burns in, not out, which explains
why nothing else caught on fire.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.758
Based on the position
of the body,

06:29.848 --> 06:32.635
the victim was either
unconscious or dead
when the fire started.

06:32.726 --> 06:36.719

get away from the flames.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.712
All right, all right.
Okay. Just asking.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.422
Do you remember when
I taught you how to pitch?

11:23.517 --> 11:25.223
You thought
I was too old then too.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.517
I’ll tell you, you had
the best sinker I ever saw.

11:27.646 --> 11:31.059
I could never
get that one right.
Your fastball could smoke mine.

11:32.401 --> 11:36.189
Glad you’re here, Pops.
Yeah. And don’t worry.

11:36.280 --> 11:40.239
If you ever need a little
privacy with the bone doctor,
I’ll make myself scarce.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.657
Okay. Thanks.
But there’s nothing
going on between us.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.778
You gay?
What? No.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.080
She’s a keeper.
You should listen to me.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.166
I warned you about Rebecca
being a waste of time, didn’t I?
Come on, Pops.

11:51.295 --> 11:55.459
I can take care of
my own love life.
I don’t think so.

11:59.303 --> 12:02.386
I gotta get a book light.
I won’t get in your way.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.724
All right. Listen, uh,
Pops, do me a favor.

12:04.808 --> 12:08.426
Why don’t you just— just stand
right here at the entrance,
right underneath this big sign?

12:08.520 --> 12:10.761
I gotta go find the manager.

12:10.856 --> 12:12.847
Well, go.
Keep America safe.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.603
Don’t wander off.
Stay right here.

12:21.742 --> 12:25.155
Excuse me.
Um, where would I find
electrical tape?

12:26.663 --> 12:29.325
Let’s see.

12:29.416 --> 12:34.410
lthink—
lthi— I think I can
help you find it.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.337
This way.

12:37.424 --> 12:41.542
Meg Tracy’s
been AWOL since Tuesday.
Never called. Not like her.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.010
Would you happen to have
an employee photo?
Sure.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.349
Did she do something?
I don’t wanna get dragged
into anything.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.890
No, we’re just concerned
something may have happened
to her. That’s all.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.559
Maybe you heard complaints
about me?

12:51.647 --> 12:54.263
But it’s from
those slackers and deadbeats
who don’t do theirjob.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.560
I keep my nose clean.
The photo.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.893
I’ll get her whole file.
Just leave me out of it.

12:59.029 --> 13:02.317
Kitchen and bath,
right down there.
Great. Thank you.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.820
Pops, what are you doing?
You don’t work here.
Why are you wearing that vest?

13:05.911 --> 13:09.199
Well, three people said I was
a good greeter, so I got a vest.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.873
- Okay, Pops. We gotta go.
Let’s go. Take the vest off.
- My shift’s not over.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.871
No. You’re not on a shift.
Will you just—

13:14.962 --> 13:17.123
You think
this is the break room?
Because I will fire you.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.830
Slow down, okay?
This here
is my grandfather.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.631
He’s just a big fan
of the store.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.504
He’s always wanted
to work here,
but not today.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.379
We gotta get this file back
to Bones, okay? Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.094
[ Woman ]
Where would / find
fertilizer for azaleas ?

13:34.189 --> 13:36.100
Aisle 4.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.774
[ Saroyan ]
This woman ’s
a size four, tops.

13:39.861 --> 13:43.149
She must have recently
lost a significant
amount of weight.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.401
Her doctor confirmed
that she had been treated...

13:45.492 --> 13:48.325
for both the microfractures
we found in the foot
and the Haglund’s Deformity.

13:48.412 --> 13:51.279
But on her last visit with him,
she weighed 234 pounds.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.705
Baby had back.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.078
Sorry. I don’t know
where that came from.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.252
The doctor’s X-rays
of the foot match ours.
lt’s Meg Tracy

13:59.339 --> 14:01.125
If Meg was thin,
why so much ash?

14:01.216 --> 14:03.753
Because there was someone else
in bed with Meg.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.926
Two people died
in that fire.

14:08.557 --> 14:11.048
[ Saroyan ]
So now we’re looking
at a double murder.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.398
Given the amount
of ash and bone,

14:20.485 --> 14:23.727
these remains represent
approximately 380 pounds
of human.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.780
We know that Meg Tracy
weighed about 120,

14:26.867 --> 14:29.233
which puts our
second victim at 260.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.363
This is part
of the mental eminence.

14:31.455 --> 14:34.743
Judging by the angle
of the jaw fragment,
the second victim was male.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.119
A supersize male.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.791
The cake on the table
was probably his.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.461
I still don’t have nearly
enough to give you a face.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.754
I’m still working
on these inorganics.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.877
l’ll separate the male
and female bone fragments,

14:44.968 --> 14:46.754
see if they share any injuries.

14:51.641 --> 14:56.351
We ’re st/l/ assembling evidence,
ana/yZIng the bones and
constructing 3-D Imagery

14:56.438 --> 15:01.649
They got lighter fluid and
Pres-to-Logs over at PriceCo.
They could burn somebody up.

15:01.777 --> 15:04.268
There’s no evidence
of an accelerant.
Yet.

15:04.362 --> 15:07.490
That manager over there
that yelled at me,

15:07.574 --> 15:09.360
I saw the look
in her eyes.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.614
- l was an M.P., you know.
- Pops, this is a little bit
more complicated...

15:12.704 --> 15:15.411
than, you know, arresting
some drunk soldiers that
just wandered off the base.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.371
I don’t think so.
[Chuckles]

15:17.459 --> 15:19.415
Did I take
these blue pills?

15:19.503 --> 15:21.164
Yeah, and you took
the yellow ones too.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.166
lfeel like a damn
chemistry experiment.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.249
They didn’t have
this stuff 50 years ago,
and everybody was fine.

15:27.344 --> 15:31.132
Actually, medicine
has increased life expectancy
quite a bit since 1959.

15:31.223 --> 15:34.681
- Fifty years ago,
you’d probably be dead.
- Bones.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.134
Oh, I like her. She’s real.
She’s got balls.

15:37.229 --> 15:39.220
Well, ovaries actually.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.431
- All right. You got
a pair of steel ovaries.
- Thank you.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.142
- Will you two please—
- Always so proper.
Will you loosen up?

15:45.237 --> 15:48.104
- He’s quite skittish when
the subject of seX comes up.
- No, I’m not.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.323
- Maybe / didn ’t give h/m enough
information when he was a kid
- [ Cell Phone Ringing]

15:51.409 --> 15:54.071
[Beeps]
Booth. Oh, yeah.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.278
I’ll come in right now.
All right.

15:56.373 --> 15:59.581
- What’s goin’ on?
- They brought in Meg Tracy’s
roommate for questioning.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.542
I should go talk to her.
Look, I’m sorry, Pops.
We’ll play dominoes later.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.086
- You’ll lose.
- You wish.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.164
I love that kid.

16:09.678 --> 16:12.465
I’m more proud of him
than anybody in the world.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.842
I think he feels
the same way.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.390
He had no one else
when his father walked out.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.638
He was lucky to have you.

16:19.729 --> 16:23.017
[Sighs]
I never had the nerve...

16:23.108 --> 16:25.394
to tell him
that it was my fault.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.602
What was?

16:28.697 --> 16:32.690
Well, if I was a better man,
maybe I— I could’ve figured
something else out.

16:34.578 --> 16:38.617
But when I saw my son
hitting Seeley,

16:38.707 --> 16:40.663
beating that little kid,

16:40.750 --> 16:42.661
that was it.

16:42.752 --> 16:46.370
I said, “Get out! You don’t
deserve to be a father.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.455
Get out!”

16:49.718 --> 16:52.881
He never came back.

16:52.971 --> 16:58.182
So I— l was left with—
with the two boys.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.135
You’re a good man, Hank.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.605
I didn’t know
what else to do.

17:07.152 --> 17:09.438
He was beating my grandson.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.575
Look, when the time
is right,

17:16.661 --> 17:19.118
you’ll tell him.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.447
And if he, uh—

17:21.541 --> 17:24.954
if he needs it,
you’ll hold him, okay?

17:26.838 --> 17:28.794
Okay.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.503
[Sighs]

17:38.016 --> 17:40.678
I wondered why Meg hadn’t
come back to the apartment.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.511
I tried to call.
You’re sure it’s Meg?

17:43.605 --> 17:46.062
I’m afraid so.
How long have you guys
been roommates?

17:46.149 --> 17:49.232
Three years.
We were weight-loss buddies.

17:49.319 --> 17:52.152
This year, the loser
paid for the other one
to go to Hawaii.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.321
incentive, you know?

17:54.407 --> 17:56.784
I lost, obviously.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.985
- So you paid for Meg’s trip?
- Meg lost over
a hundred pounds.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.366
I lost six.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.664
How did she die?

18:04.751 --> 18:07.914
Well, we’re still working
on cause of death. Yeah.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.995
She was with a man.

18:12.008 --> 18:16.547
You happen to know
who, uh, Meg was dating?

18:16.638 --> 18:19.846
Mmm. No one special.
I would’ve known.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.558
She used to
meet different guys
at Club Jiggle.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.260
Club Jiggle?

18:25.355 --> 18:28.893
For thin people who, uh—

18:28.984 --> 18:31.475
Let’s say they appreciate
people my size.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.527
/ went myself
a couple of times,
but it was too freaky.

18:34.656 --> 18:39.571
These skinny guys saying
they wanted to fondle my cankles
and eat brisket out of my navel.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.744
- It skeeved me out.
- Brisket?

18:44.207 --> 18:46.789
Right. That’s a whole—
whole nother world, I guess.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.868
Um, can you verify
where you were
the night of the 10th?

18:49.963 --> 18:52.875
Um, there was
a big house party.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.048
l was there
until after 2:00 am.

18:55.135 --> 18:58.798
Um, can you do me a favor
and just, uh, you know,

18:58.888 --> 19:01.300
write down the names
of, uh, people...

19:01.391 --> 19:04.007
who could verify that they
saw you at the party there?

19:05.437 --> 19:07.894
Am I a suspect?

19:13.570 --> 19:16.152
You can get
the second victim’s height
from bone fragments?

19:16.239 --> 19:20.983
When subjected to intense heat,
the long bones warp, crack and
contract in predictable ways.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.363
Based on the figures
that Clark gave me,

19:23.455 --> 19:26.322
l was able to partially
reconstruct a male fibula.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.452
[ Beeping ]

19:28.543 --> 19:32.912
The amount of bone shrinkage
from heat exposure
was about 20%.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.964
Which allows you
to calculate height.
That’s brilliant.

19:36.051 --> 19:39.259
We know our vict/m
was apprOX/mate/y 260 pounds.

19:40.930 --> 19:45.173
Yeah, but based
on the fibula,
he was 5’5”.

19:45.268 --> 19:48.510
5 ’5 ’j 260.
That’s a start.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.596
I’ll tell Booth.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.898
Meg may have been participating
in a “feeder and eater” fetish.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.317
Her roommate said
that the guys at the club...

19:56.404 --> 19:59.111
wanted to eat, uh, brisket
out of her navel.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.315
Okay.
That would make sense.

20:01.409 --> 20:04.867
Fetishes are common
in all sexually repressive
societies like ours.

20:04.954 --> 20:08.697
Yeah, feeders and eaters
are a subcategory
of fat fetishism...

20:08.792 --> 20:11.704
that involves
an obese person,
or an eater,

20:11.795 --> 20:13.956
and a feeder that derives
sexual pleasure...

20:14.047 --> 20:16.629
out of the gaining
and fondling of body fat.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.549
That would explain the, uh—
the cake next to the bed.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.127
Which I’m probably never
gonna wanna eat again.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.587
Hank said you love cake.

20:23.681 --> 20:26.343
I usually do. Well— Wait.
Are we staying on point here?

20:26.434 --> 20:28.550
Well, we were discussing
cake, weren’t we?

20:28.645 --> 20:31.432
- Oh, he’s making you grilled
cheese tonight, by the way.
- Really?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.350
Yes. I’m invited.
Mmm.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.397
How’s it going
with your grandfather?

20:35.485 --> 20:39.023
I know it can be very stressful
to be responsible for someone
who’s elderly.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.479
It’s fine.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.315
He does take
a lot of medication,
so he has health issues.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.321
You have to stay
on top of that.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.903
He took care of me
when l was sick.
I could take care of him.

20:47.997 --> 20:51.125
it’s not gonna be easy
for mm to build a new life
here at his age.

20:51.209 --> 20:53.825
And he’s got a history
of aggressive behavior,
right?

20:53.920 --> 20:56.662
- If he ever wants to talk,
I’d be more than happy—
- Sorry, sorry.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.418
We were talking
about murder here, right?
Meg Tracy, fondling of fat?

20:59.551 --> 21:01.087
Of course.
Right

21:01.177 --> 21:03.589
Why would Meg
go back to the club
if she wasn’t fat anymore?

21:03.680 --> 21:06.342
Meg lived for many years
as an obese woman.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.596
Her obsession with food
is not something that
would just go away.

21:09.686 --> 21:12.052
She would have to struggle
with it every day.

21:12.147 --> 21:14.308
Right. So you’re saying
that she missed overeating
so much...

21:14.399 --> 21:18.108
that she fed other people
in order to feed herself?

21:18.194 --> 21:20.401
Yes, exactly.

21:20.488 --> 21:24.652
So, the eater became a feeder,
and somehow it got her killed.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.698
Mm-hmm.

21:30.373 --> 21:33.661
Pops has been
making grilled cheese
for a long time.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.787
I had these about
three times a week.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.956
They’re amazing, right?
Mm-hmm. Very good.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.709
I learned how to make these
during the battle of lnchon.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.634
American cheese
reminded us of home.
We kept fighting.

21:44.721 --> 21:47.087
Come on. Dig in, Bones.
This is real food here.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.468
- We should get
to the club, Booth.
- Bones is right.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.301
- We got a lot of people
to interrogate, Pops.
- Oh, sure.

21:52.395 --> 21:55.057
- Amazing, huh?
- What channel’s
the fishing channel on?

21:55.190 --> 21:56.475
1 35.
All right

21:56.566 --> 21:59.023
You’re out
of your Coumadin, Hank.

21:59.110 --> 22:03.353
- Ah, I forgot. So many pills.
- These pills are important.

22:03.448 --> 22:06.690
if you forget to take them,
you could get clots, have
a heart attack or stroke.

22:06.784 --> 22:09.275
- I don’t think so.

There was a cake

Could the injury
be caused by a knife?
No. It’s not a knife.

See, the markings
are jagged.

22:34.604 --> 22:37.220

any recognizable weapon.

“I know.”

33:24.545 --> 33:27.082
Thanks for coming in, Bones.
You know, he really wanted
to see you.

33:27.214 --> 33:30.047
Are you sure you don’t need me?
No. I’ll interrogate
her roommate.

33:30.176 --> 33:33.384
If I get anything,
I’ll call you.
I’m sorry.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.176
Yeah.

33:35.264 --> 33:38.631
I guess he needs more
than I can give
right now, huh?

33:38.726 --> 33:41.183
Maybe I should take
a leave of absence.

33:41.270 --> 33:45.559
Can you afford to do that?
You have a son
to take care of too.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.356
Pops will think
I don’t love him.

33:48.444 --> 33:50.856
Really?

33:50.946 --> 33:52.902
I should go.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.574
So we know that Meg
used your insurance card
for the Slim Ring surgery.

33:57.703 --> 34:01.742
What? That’s why
I got turned down?
Oh, you didn’t know?

34:01.832 --> 34:05.575
I went in for a routine checkup,
and my insurance company
declined payment.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.705
They said I’d exceeded
my annual limit.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.787
I thought it was a mistake.

34:09.882 --> 34:12.794
That’s how she lost the weight?
That bitch.

34:12.885 --> 34:15.467
All right. So you’re saying
that, um, she stole
your insurance card.

34:15.554 --> 34:19.092
Well, no. I—
I let her use my card,
but not for that.

34:19.183 --> 34:21.890
She was sick.
She didn’t have any insurance,
so I helped her out.

34:21.977 --> 34:24.468
- You know that’s a crime.
- Isn’t it a crime
when your roommate...

34:24.563 --> 34:26.554
screws you out of 10 grand
worth of medical coverage?

34:26.649 --> 34:30.392
- Sorry, but you’re not
answering my question here.
- She cheated on our bet.

34:30.486 --> 34:33.228
I paid for her trip to Hawaii too.
I can’t believe this.

34:33.322 --> 34:36.735
-You were at the party the night
that Meg was killed, correct?
-Yes.

34:36.825 --> 34:39.316
We talked to those people
off the list that you gave us,

34:39.411 --> 34:42.619
and that was an awfully
big party— big enough
for you to disappear in.

34:42.706 --> 34:46.073
And no one could really tell,
you know, if you’d gone
or if you’d left.

34:46.168 --> 34:48.159
They— They didn’t know.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.960
Great.

34:50.047 --> 34:52.834
You’re never gonna believe me,
so now l have to pay
for a lawyer too.

34:55.678 --> 34:59.011
Have you found anything,
Dr. Edison?
Yes.

34:59.098 --> 35:02.682
All of these bone fragments
are scarred exclusively
with markers from the fire.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.601
But these two—
a piece of the parietal
and occipital—

35:05.729 --> 35:09.563
seem to show evidence
of being fractured.
Huh.

35:09.650 --> 35:14.644
Definitely could’ve been made
by the pointed object Angela’s
trying to identify.

35:14.738 --> 35:17.150
Look at this.

35:17.241 --> 35:20.483
- Residue along the edge
of the fracture ?
- It’s a resin.

35:26.083 --> 35:30.122
The resin consists of terpenes
and phenolic compounds.

35:30.212 --> 35:33.704
It’s wood.
He was struck with a weapon
made out of wood.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.541
- Teak, to be exact.
- The bed is teak.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.422
The wounds on Meg’s hand
were clearly defensive,

35:39.513 --> 35:42.471
so she couldn’t have
accidentally hit her hand
against the posts.

35:42.558 --> 35:45.425
And the blows were sufficient
to render them unconscious.

35:45.519 --> 35:47.976
The finials.
The what?

35:48.063 --> 35:52.477
The decorative knobs that
go on top of the posts—
they’re missing.

35:52.568 --> 35:57.312
So the rest of the bed was
carved, which means the finials
must have been carved too.

35:57.406 --> 36:02.025
This is the real estate
agent’s virtual tour
of Howard’s house.

36:05.122 --> 36:07.909
Look, we have finials.

36:09.918 --> 36:13.752
The reason why
the image looked like a nose
is because it was a nose.

36:13.839 --> 36:17.548
The vict/m was beaten
with one of these heads.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.132
Wait! That’s Howard Fileman,
the homeowner.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.179
He said he was
a master carpenter.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.553
So the other one
was probably his wife.

36:38.364 --> 36:40.320
Well, it’s a match.

36:40.407 --> 36:43.365
So, it wasn’t about
who was having sex,

36:43.452 --> 36:45.659
but about where
they were having sex.

36:45.746 --> 36:48.613
Howard carved this bed
for him and his wife.
It was a symbol of their love.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.743
Meg and Hugo
both had roommates.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.825
The house was cheaper
than a hotel.

36:52.920 --> 36:56.037
Howard catches Meg and Hugo
having sex in his bed.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.042
Weird cake sex.

36:58.133 --> 37:02.217
He kills them, sets the bed
on fire and then leaves with
the busts of him and his wife.

It’s mainly horrible.

I’ll tell Booth.
Howard might still
have the finials.

37:12.815 --> 37:14.806
We’ll pull blood
and tissue from them.
