00:30.860 --> 00:34.772
Read all about it! Belgium massacre.

00:34.822 --> 00:38.734
Many dead. Read all about it.

00:38.784 --> 00:42.987
Read all about it.
Read all about it.

00:44.106 --> 00:46.178
Belgium massacre.

00:46.228 --> 00:48.219
'Oribble, ain't it?

00:48.269 --> 00:50.949
Women and children I heard.
No mercy shown they say.

00:52.951 --> 00:56.943
If you want to read all about it,
you need to buy it. It's a penny!

00:56.994 --> 00:58.664
Sorry, Guv'nor.
God bless ya.

00:58.714 --> 01:00.955
Read all about it!

01:22.967 --> 01:26.929
Hundreds dead it says here.
Something has to be done.

01:27.929 --> 01:30.200
Doesn't mean we have to be
the ones to do it.

01:30.250 --> 01:33.162
Every Englishman must defend
his country's honour!

01:33.212 --> 01:34.882
It says so right here on page two.

01:38.894 --> 01:43.296
Well, I wouldn't believe everything
you read in the papers, George.

01:44.418 --> 01:47.019
You'll get your money.

01:48.940 --> 01:51.211
So you keep saying, Mr LeClair.

01:51.261 --> 01:54.293
Yet so far you have failed
to keep your promises.

01:54.343 --> 01:56.703
Contact me when we can do business.

02:08.870 --> 02:11.421
I can't believe we've had
so many replies

02:11.471 --> 02:13.822
to such a simple charity event.

02:13.873 --> 02:17.424
One still has one's uses.
I couldn't have done it without you.

02:17.475 --> 02:19.025
Of course you could.

02:19.075 --> 02:22.227
It simply would have taken you
just a little longer.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.427
Miss Day.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.188
Delphine!
Rose.

02:25.239 --> 02:28.270
I didn't think you could make it.
I saw the error of my selfish ways.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.031
Business can wait,
for a day at least.

02:31.082 --> 02:34.754
If I can sell wine, I can sell
Belgian chocolates for charity.

02:34.803 --> 02:37.995
Have you seen the headlines?
These poor people!

02:38.045 --> 02:40.605
Yes. It is a dreadful business.
I do agree.

02:41.847 --> 02:45.438
Mae and I were just discussing
our Palm Court display.

02:45.489 --> 02:48.840
There's two choices.
Mae prefers this one.

02:48.891 --> 02:50.372
Flags?

02:51.971 --> 02:53.963
Isn't it a little erm...?

02:54.013 --> 02:55.484
Traditional?

02:55.534 --> 02:59.216
Or some would say patriotic,
which is why I suggested them.

03:00.577 --> 03:04.208
It really doesn't matter which one
we choose. The important thing...

03:04.259 --> 03:06.890
Just hanging there like that?
It's so old-fashioned.

03:06.939 --> 03:09.570
I mean, this one's far more
interesting.

03:09.621 --> 03:13.652
Tables arranged in a circle,
lots of jolly bunting.

03:13.703 --> 03:15.574
Rose, which one do you prefer?

03:15.624 --> 03:18.656
One would hate to be considered
old-fashioned.

03:18.706 --> 03:22.458
Harry! We need your eye.

03:22.508 --> 03:26.299
Ladies... Ah, Monsieur Neuhaus
and his delicious chocolates!

03:26.350 --> 03:30.462
Harry! We are raising money for
Belgian refugees. No free samples.

03:30.512 --> 03:32.422
We were discussing the display.

03:32.472 --> 03:35.584
Tables arranged in a circle
with lots of lovely bunting,

03:35.634 --> 03:39.306
or flags hanging by tables
in two straight rows?

03:39.356 --> 03:42.147
This one. A circle every time.

03:42.197 --> 03:44.438
It's more...modern.

03:45.879 --> 03:48.712
Good. Good.

03:48.761 --> 03:51.433
Good. Good.
So then, we're all agreed?

03:51.483 --> 03:56.196
So, let's see, we will start with
Monsieur Neuhaus's demonstration?

03:56.245 --> 03:59.156
The leaflets and donation forms
will be made available,

03:59.206 --> 04:02.158
so then all we really have to do
is just take the money.

04:03.689 --> 04:07.080
I admire you all and you certainly
make it sound simple.

04:07.131 --> 04:08.440
I am sorry, Harry?

04:08.491 --> 04:11.522
All I'm saying is keeping a store
full of customers happy

04:11.572 --> 04:13.403
is harder than it looks.

04:13.454 --> 04:16.485
Rose, I believe your darling husband
is setting us a challenge.

04:16.535 --> 04:19.245
You think us women aren't up to it?

04:19.297 --> 04:21.368
No, no, no... I'm simply saying...

04:21.418 --> 04:24.329
I think you're right.
Well, let's see shall we, Harry?

04:24.379 --> 04:28.892
I think you'll find that we ladies
can be the stalwarts of Selfridges.

04:28.942 --> 04:30.012
Hmm.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.412
Hmm.

04:31.463 --> 04:33.174
Thank you.

04:33.223 --> 04:35.255
I've had another idea.

04:35.305 --> 04:38.136
Samples and collection points
all over the store.

04:38.186 --> 04:40.537
That way we can maximise
our takings.

04:40.587 --> 04:43.619
If Harry doesn't object?
I'll talk to him.

04:43.669 --> 04:47.391
He does seem in good spirits.
I will admit that things are better.

04:48.792 --> 04:51.503
Not like that!
Oh my goodness.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.824
So, I will see you at two?

04:53.874 --> 04:56.876
We have a point to prove, don't we?
We do.

05:00.597 --> 05:02.679
There you are, Miss.
Thank you.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.471
I've not even made up my mind yet!

05:08.522 --> 05:10.633
I am a sick man!

05:10.683 --> 05:12.754
I know, I know, you're dying(!)

05:12.805 --> 05:14.955
This heart is weak. Weak!

05:15.005 --> 05:18.237
It is the Colleano family curse.
You don't need to go to war!

05:18.287 --> 05:21.038
But if I did, you'd have help.
Gabriella.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.280
Gabriella is just a girl.

05:23.330 --> 05:27.361
Running a restaurant is man's work.
Maybe man's work is fighting a war.

05:27.412 --> 05:29.853
I'll see you tonight.
We can talk then.

05:36.776 --> 05:39.848
All the talk appears to be
of joining up.

05:39.897 --> 05:42.738
Has Mrs Grove mentioned it
to you at all?

05:43.740 --> 05:47.542
Although my complexion may suggest
otherwise, I am a little too old.

05:48.862 --> 05:52.254
War is a young man's game, surely?
You would think so.

05:52.305 --> 05:55.936
However, Mrs Crabb really seemed
quite keen on the idea.

05:55.986 --> 05:59.868
One almost thinks she sees it as
a way of getting me out of her hair.

06:05.871 --> 06:07.432
Ah...

06:15.835 --> 06:17.637
All right, in you come.

06:19.758 --> 06:23.469
Murdered they say!
Women and children shown no mercy.

06:23.519 --> 06:26.871
All on the direct orders
of the Kaiser himself.

06:26.921 --> 06:29.193
Question is,
what are we going to do about it?

06:29.243 --> 06:32.005
We fight! Matter of honour I reckon.

06:33.765 --> 06:36.436
Smash as many German heads
as you like, George Towler,

06:36.487 --> 06:39.609
but break my French Champagne
and I'll shoot you myself.

06:40.928 --> 06:42.239
So you're signing up then?

06:42.289 --> 06:44.880
First chance I get. Try and stop me.

06:44.930 --> 06:47.002
I reckon the girls
love a man in uniform!

06:47.052 --> 06:49.523
With a face like that,
you need all the help you can get.

06:49.573 --> 06:51.165
Yeah, all right.

06:51.214 --> 06:53.925
Does your Agnes
know about this, George?

06:53.975 --> 06:56.527
She will, soon enough.

06:56.576 --> 07:00.368
I wish I was going with you.
They say you have to be 16.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.331
What about you two?

07:02.379 --> 07:05.051
Coming to teach the Hun
a thing or two?

07:05.102 --> 07:06.862
All in good time.

07:07.903 --> 07:09.104
No rush, is there?

07:10.223 --> 07:12.665
Tell that to them poor Belgians.

07:14.505 --> 07:17.697
Clearly we cannot prevent
the men from enlisting,

07:17.748 --> 07:19.938
but I don't see how we can
keep positions open.

07:19.989 --> 07:23.861
We have always prided ourselves
on being different. Better.

07:23.911 --> 07:27.063
Now...this is just another example.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.343
Temporary posts will be
impossible to fill.

07:29.393 --> 07:31.744
No, they will be difficult,
but not impossible.

07:31.794 --> 07:33.826
And, if the politicians are right,

07:33.875 --> 07:36.547
we'll have our boys back
by Christmas.

07:36.597 --> 07:38.469
I wish I shared your confidence.

07:38.518 --> 07:41.390
We must hope for the best
and prepare for the worst.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.430
We mustn't overreact.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.992
Yes, but we must do something.

07:46.043 --> 07:50.474
Three months may as well be
three years if we have no staff.

07:50.524 --> 07:52.595
What about those who are
too old to enlist?

07:52.645 --> 07:54.516
We know they won't be
running off to war.

07:54.566 --> 07:57.958
We're talking about physical work,
deliveries, the loading bay...

07:58.007 --> 07:59.438
Just because one is elderly...

07:59.489 --> 08:02.040
I want you both to explore
every option.

08:02.090 --> 08:05.051
Whatever it takes,
I won't let my men down.

08:06.973 --> 08:08.773
This your doing, is it?

08:09.774 --> 08:13.326
My restaurant filled with foreign
flags and staffed by amateurs?

08:13.375 --> 08:16.167
I think Mrs Selfridge
just wants to help the refugees.

08:16.217 --> 08:18.928
Tell him what Arthur
told you downstairs.

08:18.978 --> 08:20.810
Babies on bayonets. Civilians.

08:20.859 --> 08:23.131
It's not right.
You can say that again!

08:23.180 --> 08:26.013
Your George is already
polishing his medals.

08:26.063 --> 08:28.694
Can't wait to bloody
the Kaiser's nose.

08:28.744 --> 08:31.575
Has he told you he's enlisting?
Yes, he has.

08:31.625 --> 08:34.866
Seems like half the store are going.

08:36.347 --> 08:38.058
I know he won't listen to me.

08:38.109 --> 08:39.940
Perhaps you could
have a word with him?

08:39.990 --> 08:42.220
Ask him to at least think about it?

08:42.270 --> 08:46.183
Not a chance. Got enough on my plate
arguing with Uncle Gio.

08:46.233 --> 08:48.543
Apparently, it's every
brave Italian's duty

08:48.593 --> 08:50.545
to stay at home and make tagliatelli.

08:50.595 --> 08:52.475
But, what are you going to do?

08:54.036 --> 08:55.316
I don't know.

09:04.722 --> 09:06.953
Yet more men, Mr Selfridge.

09:07.003 --> 09:09.726
At this rate,
we'll have our very own regiment!

09:14.247 --> 09:15.917
Mr Crabb.

09:15.968 --> 09:19.280
Yes, Chief?
My wife's charity event today.

09:19.329 --> 09:21.360
I have an idea how to round it off.
Indeed?

09:21.411 --> 09:24.732
But, it'll take a little
organisation on your part...

09:26.574 --> 09:29.244
..and I need it to be
a complete surprise.

09:31.496 --> 09:35.567
All I'm saying is that
you could have discussed it with me.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.489
Why? So you could try
and change my mind?

09:38.540 --> 09:41.461
You're my brother.
And this is my country!

09:49.024 --> 09:52.817
Everybody has a choice, George.
Yes, they do.

09:52.867 --> 09:54.667
And I've made mine.

10:05.412 --> 10:08.005
I want you as my Deputy.

10:08.055 --> 10:12.646
At a time like this, I need a man
with your experience and your talent.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.528
I don't think so, Harry.

10:14.578 --> 10:17.570
We all need our lucky charms,
even me.

10:17.620 --> 10:21.372
So, what do you say?
Be my right-hand man.

10:21.421 --> 10:24.573
This war,
with everything so uncertain...

10:24.623 --> 10:27.534
All the more reason to come back
to what you know.

10:27.584 --> 10:31.096
I want to keep my friends
close by, Henri.

10:31.146 --> 10:34.057
I'm honoured but...
Is it about the money?

10:34.107 --> 10:36.149
Because if it is...

10:38.150 --> 10:39.631
..just tell me when to stop.

10:44.393 --> 10:47.024
Stop this. OK. OK! Fine. I'll stay.

10:47.075 --> 10:49.796
But for six months. No longer.
I'll take it.

10:50.997 --> 10:52.827
And you have to live at my house.

10:52.877 --> 10:55.628
With the girls in the States,
it's like the Savoy on a Sunday.

10:55.678 --> 10:58.910
That won't be necessary.
Absolutely no negotiations.

11:01.002 --> 11:03.472
You are an impossible man.
Mmm.

11:03.523 --> 11:06.564
Look where it got me!

11:14.848 --> 11:16.129
A begging bowl?

11:18.009 --> 11:19.481
Absolutely not!

11:19.531 --> 11:21.202
I thought all of the customers

11:21.251 --> 11:23.203
should be made aware
of the charity event.

11:23.252 --> 11:27.495
By littering my department with
sweets and scraps of paper?

11:28.495 --> 11:31.407
I-I'm sorry, but Mrs Selfridge
specifically asked me to...

11:31.458 --> 11:34.369
This is fashion,
not some common confectioners!

11:34.418 --> 11:37.010
I believe Miss Towler is simply
trying to do her job.

11:37.059 --> 11:39.450
I am simply trying to do mine,
Mr LeClair.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.253
I am in charge of what happens here.

11:42.303 --> 11:44.023
I'm afraid I must insist.

11:45.945 --> 11:49.296
On whose authority?
I am now Mr Selfridge's Deputy.

11:49.347 --> 11:52.147
He has given me a free hand
on all creative decisions.

11:54.388 --> 11:57.221
But, if you wish to discuss it
with him personally...?

11:59.111 --> 12:00.432
That won't be necessary.

12:15.719 --> 12:18.040
I'm glad you decided to stay on.

12:19.681 --> 12:24.233
But, I'm still a little confused.
Wh-What exactly is your role?

12:24.284 --> 12:27.125
Apparently anything Mr Selfridge
wants it to be.

12:29.247 --> 12:31.407
Harry made me a good offer.

12:34.769 --> 12:37.640
Just connecting you now, Sir.

12:37.690 --> 12:41.212
Paddington 217.
Mister Webb. I have your money.

12:42.853 --> 12:44.814
I'll meet you at four o'clock.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.608
You're a working woman, Pimble.

12:53.658 --> 12:57.181
Which one screams modest,
but elegantly practical?

12:58.342 --> 13:01.263
I'd say you were
spoiled for choice, M'Lady.

13:02.503 --> 13:05.024
So diplomatic. You decide.

13:07.306 --> 13:09.147
Oh...

13:10.347 --> 13:14.099
I imagine Loxley may have more
boot manufacturers calling today.

13:14.149 --> 13:15.620
Very good.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.751
So, I need you to be my
Eye of Providence, Pimble.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.384
Seeing all, saying nothing.
Understand me?

13:23.434 --> 13:25.554
Completely, M'Lady.

13:26.715 --> 13:28.476
What about the chocolate boxes?

13:29.517 --> 13:31.789
Well, I thought simple...

13:31.839 --> 13:34.280
OK. Yes. It's certainly that.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.640
Erm...

13:38.282 --> 13:39.392
Oh.

13:39.442 --> 13:42.324
I thought the message
should speak loudest.

13:43.964 --> 13:45.916
Or with a ribbon.

13:45.966 --> 13:47.886
What do you think?

13:49.687 --> 13:51.849
I think you know exactly
what you are doing.

13:53.009 --> 13:55.320
No ribbon. No bow.

13:55.370 --> 13:58.451
Just the message. Simple.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.053
Perfect.

14:04.535 --> 14:07.327
Your references are
impeccable, Mr Jones.

14:07.376 --> 14:09.497
Anything else, Mr Grove?

14:11.098 --> 14:12.448
Oh, just one.

14:12.499 --> 14:16.340
Could you lift that packing case
and place it on my desk?

14:31.909 --> 14:33.940
D-Don't...

14:39.192 --> 14:42.704
Ah, Mr Colleano,
is the Palm Court prepared?

14:42.755 --> 14:44.706
I believe so, Mr Selfridge.
Good.

14:44.756 --> 14:48.147
I don't need to tell you my wife is
very keen that today runs smoothly.

14:48.198 --> 14:51.509
However, I'm sure you will appreciate

14:51.559 --> 14:54.030
that she and her friends
may not be quite so...

14:54.080 --> 14:56.030
Experienced in sales?

14:56.081 --> 14:58.433
Indeed. So...

14:58.482 --> 15:02.835
Any help you and Franco could give,
needs to be discreet.

15:02.886 --> 15:05.877
This is her day, all right, Victor?
And so it should be.

15:05.927 --> 15:08.397
Leave it with me, Mr Selfridge.
Thank you.

15:08.448 --> 15:10.209
Miss Plunkett.

15:11.769 --> 15:14.280
Miss Plunkett, do you have
any smelling salts?

15:19.333 --> 15:23.645
Of course, the praline was
originally developed by my father.

15:23.695 --> 15:28.368
A sweet chocolate shell
for the bitter medicines

15:28.418 --> 15:31.850
our doctors insist on giving us to...

15:31.900 --> 15:33.970
To sweeten the pill?

15:35.582 --> 15:38.774
However, my family
was the first to realise

15:38.823 --> 15:42.576
that beautiful chocolate

15:42.625 --> 15:46.057
could also be a vessel of pure,

15:46.107 --> 15:49.779
unadulterated...pleasure.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.263
He's very handsome.

15:57.313 --> 15:59.663
You mean for a Belgian.

15:59.714 --> 16:02.705
It is also my pleasure to see

16:02.755 --> 16:06.507
so many of you here
in support of my country.

16:06.557 --> 16:08.469
But...

16:08.518 --> 16:12.590
I'm sure you will agree
that my deepest thanks

16:12.639 --> 16:16.162
should go to the person
who has made this possible...

16:17.363 --> 16:23.046
..Mrs Selfridge...the beautiful Rose.

16:28.729 --> 16:31.600
Here. Voila.

16:36.452 --> 16:37.973
We should learn to do that!

16:40.015 --> 16:42.936
I'm sorry,
they just look too good to eat.

16:43.776 --> 16:45.136
Please.

16:53.141 --> 16:55.893
Mmm. Delicious.

16:55.943 --> 16:58.053
Truly delicious.

17:14.471 --> 17:17.903
Oh no, I quite agree.
It's dreadful what's been going on.

17:17.953 --> 17:20.704
Even my chauffeur has joined up.
- Really?

17:20.756 --> 17:22.556
Is one expected to walk?

17:23.597 --> 17:25.307
Your chocolates, Lady Colclough.

17:25.357 --> 17:29.509
And I think you'll find everything
you need to know in this pamphlet.

17:29.559 --> 17:31.561
How kind. Thank you very much.

17:33.842 --> 17:37.874
We were having a conversation about
the affairs of the day, no less!

17:37.924 --> 17:40.395
Meanwhile, people
are waiting to be served.

17:40.445 --> 17:43.396
One thing I've learned
when running a club,

17:43.446 --> 17:46.959
is that a little of yourself
can go a long way.

17:47.008 --> 17:50.441
If you expect me to be brusque...

17:50.490 --> 17:52.161
This event means a lot to Rose.

17:52.211 --> 17:55.403
As her friend,
I would hate to let her down.

17:55.452 --> 17:57.133
I know you feel the same.

18:02.976 --> 18:04.537
Who's next, ladies?

18:14.983 --> 18:18.014
For the customers I think!
But we've donated, Miss Mardle.

18:18.065 --> 18:20.495
Ha'penny each,
and they're ever so delicious.

18:20.545 --> 18:21.976
You should try one.

18:23.867 --> 18:25.949
Yes, well they do look rather good.

18:27.709 --> 18:29.980
For the Belgians, Miss.

18:30.030 --> 18:32.031
Yes, of course.

18:37.194 --> 18:38.874
Mmm!
Another?

18:40.076 --> 18:41.276
Yes.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.032
She's in her element.

18:52.082 --> 18:56.114
I don't think I've seen that
expression for a long time.

18:56.164 --> 18:57.994
What expression?

18:58.044 --> 19:02.317
The way she looks when she's
truly inspired by something.

19:02.367 --> 19:05.248
For a while, I thought
it had gone forever.

19:16.975 --> 19:18.565
Your own column!

19:18.615 --> 19:21.327
You know what they say,
you can't keep a good man down!

19:21.377 --> 19:24.498
All I need now is a story.
Well, I'm very proud of you.

19:25.778 --> 19:27.660
And I think...

19:29.180 --> 19:32.942
..that you deserve a reward.

19:35.144 --> 19:39.096
Ha'penny for the girls, but I'm sure
a man with his own newspaper column

19:39.146 --> 19:41.507
can afford to put his hand
in his pocket?

19:44.267 --> 19:48.861
Excuse me. I couldn't help noticing
no-one has offered you a chocolate.

19:48.910 --> 19:51.862
Oh no, thank you. No.
That's very kind.

19:51.912 --> 19:54.513
In fact, I shouldn't really be here.

19:55.634 --> 19:57.345
I've only got thruppence left.

19:57.395 --> 19:58.915
Please.

19:59.876 --> 20:01.347
I really mustn't.

20:01.397 --> 20:05.909
Do you know it is a medical fact
that a woman's body temperature

20:05.959 --> 20:10.031
is always a degree or so warmer
than a man's?

20:10.081 --> 20:12.553
Always?
Always.

20:12.603 --> 20:15.554
Which, bien sur means
that for a woman,

20:15.605 --> 20:21.557
the entire chocolate experience is
just that little bit more sensual.

20:23.288 --> 20:24.718
Please.

20:24.769 --> 20:28.171
Thank you, but I don't really think
it's appropriate in the...

20:34.573 --> 20:36.735
Sa bonne?
Oh, yes!

20:40.857 --> 20:42.688
I saw you, and I thought,

20:42.737 --> 20:45.850
"There is a lady in dire need
of champagne."

20:45.899 --> 20:48.011
What a perceptive man you are.

20:48.061 --> 20:49.811
Cheers.
Cheers.

20:53.503 --> 20:54.974
It's a fine cause.

20:55.025 --> 20:57.225
Mmm. Mmm.

20:58.226 --> 21:00.977
Yes. We must all do our bit.
Even the landed gentry.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.618
A little bird told me Lord Loxley's

21:02.668 --> 21:04.859
working for the Ministry
of Procurement?

21:04.909 --> 21:07.380
Those little birds should
keep their beaks shut.

21:07.430 --> 21:10.863
I thought he was more interested
in slaughtering pheasants?

21:10.912 --> 21:12.263
Hmm.

21:12.313 --> 21:15.784
Germans, pheasants. All grist
to my husband's ample mill.

21:15.835 --> 21:17.556
So, it's true?

21:18.636 --> 21:22.758
Well, you know what they say, Frank,
war brings out the best in people.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.070
Luckily, I have a cousin in London.

21:27.121 --> 21:30.833
But, I know others from my country
are not so fortunate.

21:30.882 --> 21:34.204
They have lost their loved ones,
their homes.

21:35.205 --> 21:38.076
And here we are eating chocolates.
It all seems so wrong.

21:38.127 --> 21:41.168
No! You are doing all you can.

21:42.209 --> 21:43.570
Please...
Oh, no.

21:44.889 --> 21:47.051
No, thank you. I don't think I will.

21:50.333 --> 21:52.413
Would you excuse me, please?

21:59.337 --> 22:00.808
What are you doing here?

22:00.858 --> 22:04.010
Looking for some Champagne.
They are drinking us dry.

22:04.059 --> 22:07.021
There is more in the loading bay.
You best nip down there.

22:12.943 --> 22:14.935
Please take one of these.

22:14.985 --> 22:17.056
Here are you chocolates.
Thank you very much.

22:17.106 --> 22:18.547
Thank you. Good bye.

22:20.548 --> 22:23.939
I admit it, you've proved me wrong.
You should thank Delphine.

22:23.989 --> 22:25.420
She could give you lessons.

22:25.470 --> 22:30.344
You're talking as if we're finished.
What about the rose basket?

22:30.393 --> 22:32.263
But I haven't even priced it.

22:32.314 --> 22:34.225
Goodness knows how much
it's even worth.

22:34.276 --> 22:36.386
Don't you think we ought to find out?

22:36.436 --> 22:38.747
I have £17.
All for a wonderful cause.

22:38.797 --> 22:43.669
Surely some of you rich, handsome men
can reach into your deep pockets?

22:45.920 --> 22:47.912
Mr Frank Edwards!
Oh!

22:47.962 --> 22:51.353
Any special lady who needs seducing?

22:51.404 --> 22:55.276
I guarantee this wonderful gift
could woo a hareem!

22:55.326 --> 22:58.317
Too rich for my blood.
Find yourself a millionaire.

22:58.367 --> 23:01.199
Wonderful idea.
If only we had one in the audience...

23:03.210 --> 23:06.601
Mr Harry Selfridge!

23:06.651 --> 23:09.323
Please. I am merely an observer.

23:09.372 --> 23:10.724
Oh, go on!

23:10.774 --> 23:12.574
No-one you want to impress?

23:14.176 --> 23:16.567
Fine! £18.

23:16.617 --> 23:18.887
I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear that.

23:18.938 --> 23:21.450
Did he say £20?

23:21.499 --> 23:23.490
Yes! £20!

23:23.540 --> 23:26.331
It's so loud in here. Going, going.

23:26.381 --> 23:30.133
Sold to Mr Selfridge...for £25.

23:37.347 --> 23:38.337
Franco?

23:44.030 --> 23:45.941
Hey! Pack it in...

23:45.992 --> 23:48.872
There's money on this.
Get back to work! All of you.

23:50.314 --> 23:53.835
Or you can explain yourselves
to Mr Selfridge!

24:09.984 --> 24:13.015
He called us cowards.
Said we were refusing to sign up.

24:13.064 --> 24:16.297
So you start a fight? Why sign up
for a country that hates us?

24:16.347 --> 24:18.418
Sit still
or you'll make it worse.

24:18.468 --> 24:21.659
They're all idiots, Victor,
George included.

24:21.709 --> 24:23.191
Or maybe they're right.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.793
Your boots come
highly recommended, Mr Pratt.

24:32.435 --> 24:35.466
Double stitched seams,
M'Lord, for strength.

24:35.516 --> 24:38.108
Fully-treated leather uppers.

24:38.158 --> 24:40.949
Guaranteed waterproof
for 90 days.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.871
You understand this is
a very valuable contract?

24:43.921 --> 24:46.032
Absolutely, M'Lord.

24:46.082 --> 24:50.074
I'm seeing several people
like you today. Tradesmen.

24:50.123 --> 24:51.715
Healthy competition.

24:51.765 --> 24:54.876
We supply nothing but the best.
Mr Selfridge himself...

24:54.927 --> 24:57.558
Yes, yes. I don't need the patter.

24:57.607 --> 25:00.799
What I need, Mr Pratt,
is my money back.

25:00.850 --> 25:03.642
Or, at least some of it.

25:03.692 --> 25:08.003
In return for my continued patronage.
If you understand me?

25:08.053 --> 25:11.725
I can assure you I've quoted you
my very best price.

25:13.376 --> 25:15.567
Are you an honest man, Mr Pratt?

25:15.616 --> 25:18.608
Of course, M'Lord!
Thank you.

25:18.659 --> 25:20.779
That's all I need to know.

25:26.143 --> 25:27.733
You don't HAVE to go.

25:27.783 --> 25:29.214
Yes, I do.

25:29.265 --> 25:31.655
Truth is,
I just couldn't face myself.

25:31.706 --> 25:34.017
I couldn't put on patent leather
every morning

25:34.066 --> 25:36.618
knowing George was lacing his boots
at the same time.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.990
So, male pride?
No, but...

25:40.190 --> 25:42.992
Maybe there are some things
that are worth fighting for.

25:44.952 --> 25:48.103
Oh, well, don't do this for me,
Victor Colleano.

25:48.154 --> 25:52.115
If you want to do something for me,
stay here, I don't want you to go.

25:53.997 --> 25:56.598
Every soldier needs something
to come home for.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.001
Or someone.

26:06.923 --> 26:10.806
Well, then I'll just have to
worry about the two of you.

26:11.806 --> 26:13.636
Look after George for me, won't you?

26:13.686 --> 26:18.129
I know what French girls are like,
far more deadly than a German bullet.

26:19.169 --> 26:22.892
I won't let him out of my sight.
Promise.

26:33.978 --> 26:36.248
Thank you so much
for your help today.

26:36.299 --> 26:39.620
Well, you know me,
always game for new experiences.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.343
Since Loxley came back to town,
things have been...

26:47.544 --> 26:49.575
They've been difficult.

26:49.624 --> 26:51.906
I really enjoyed
being part of today.

26:54.747 --> 26:58.580
You do know you can always
count on me, no matter what happens.

26:58.630 --> 27:00.351
How do you mean?

27:02.231 --> 27:04.352
Mae, is everything all right?

27:05.273 --> 27:08.785
Never worry about me, Rose.
Never. I'm fine.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.906
I'm like a champagne cork
in the bathtub.

27:10.957 --> 27:15.029
Always popping back up.
A bit like Miss Day in that respect.

27:15.078 --> 27:17.470
She's certainly full of surprises.

27:17.519 --> 27:20.711
I must admit, she was,
she was very entertaining today.

27:20.761 --> 27:22.871
Wasn't she incredible?

27:22.922 --> 27:25.314
I wish I had her confidence.

27:25.364 --> 27:28.836
She sees something she wants
and she just takes it.

27:28.885 --> 27:30.636
It's very inspiring.

27:30.685 --> 27:32.077
Quite.

27:32.127 --> 27:35.289
Unless, of course,
it's something you want to keep.

27:39.251 --> 27:41.882
Hoodwinked! In my own store!

27:41.932 --> 27:43.483
I'm sorry, Harry.

27:43.533 --> 27:46.084
But, if anyone deserves it,
Rose does.

27:46.134 --> 27:49.856
And, naked generosity
is such good publicity.

27:52.257 --> 27:53.968
You may be right.

27:54.018 --> 27:58.970
Raising money is all very well,
but, I can do so much more.

27:59.020 --> 28:01.252
You're not thinking
of enlisting, are you?

28:01.302 --> 28:04.013
I'm serious.
I could help the war effort.

28:04.063 --> 28:05.895
As an American
I'm still free to travel.

28:05.945 --> 28:08.336
I can do better than
boots and breeches.

28:08.385 --> 28:11.817
Maybe you're talking to the
wrong people. Leave it with me.

28:11.867 --> 28:14.708
Perhaps I can make you
a few new friends.

28:18.550 --> 28:20.542
I'm glad we see eye to eye.

28:20.592 --> 28:23.223
I need the first consignment
by the end of the week.

28:23.273 --> 28:25.584
And our financial arrangement?

28:25.634 --> 28:28.545
I'll deposit it myself, M'Lord.

28:28.596 --> 28:30.787
Discretion assured.
Better be.

28:30.837 --> 28:34.990
This ship goes down, then she's
taking all hands with her.

28:35.039 --> 28:38.191
This must be kept
between us and us alone.

28:38.241 --> 28:40.071
Nobody wants any problems.

28:51.848 --> 28:53.918
Thanks to all of you,

28:53.968 --> 28:57.840
we have raised a great deal of money
for a very worthy cause.

28:57.891 --> 29:02.763
I ask you now to raise your glasses
to the people who made this possible.

29:02.813 --> 29:04.923
My wife, Rose,

29:04.974 --> 29:08.085
and the stalwarts of Selfridges.

29:08.135 --> 29:10.647
The stalwarts of Selfridges.

29:16.539 --> 29:20.933
And now, I have one
final surprise for all of you.

29:20.982 --> 29:22.933
Follow me, please.

29:28.706 --> 29:30.307
This way.

29:38.671 --> 29:40.553
What's this?

29:48.756 --> 29:50.467
Shoulders back.

29:50.518 --> 29:52.278
Chests out.

29:54.079 --> 29:56.920
And...quick march!

29:59.682 --> 30:02.673
Left. Left. Left.

31:07.797 --> 31:10.789
Ladies and Gentlemen...

31:10.838 --> 31:14.310
These are our boys. Our men.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.711
Our soldiers.

31:16.761 --> 31:19.672
Off to fight for King and Country.

31:19.722 --> 31:22.355
And when they return victorious,

31:22.405 --> 31:26.237
every man will have his job
waiting for him at Selfridges.

31:28.608 --> 31:30.478
A job fit for a hero.

31:30.528 --> 31:33.760
Three cheers
for the Selfridge Brigade.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.601
Hip hip!
- Hooray!

31:35.651 --> 31:37.922
Hip hip!
- HOORAY!

31:37.972 --> 31:39.653
Hip hip.
- Hooray!

31:41.374 --> 31:45.326
Men. You are all free to sign up!
Company, dismissed!

31:50.378 --> 31:53.210
Write to me, Miss Hawkins?
Everyone needs a sweetheart!

31:53.260 --> 31:56.971
Of course I will, George!
Every day without fail.

31:57.022 --> 32:00.373
Three cheers!
King, Country and Miss Kitty Hawkins!

32:00.424 --> 32:02.455
Hip hip hooray!

32:02.505 --> 32:04.335
Name?
- Towler.

32:04.385 --> 32:06.666
George Towler.

32:09.548 --> 32:12.460
Report to Aldershot. Next?

32:12.510 --> 32:16.422
You are Clarence Wilson
of 18 Cattis Road Pimleco?

32:16.472 --> 32:20.153
Twenty-one years old with
no physical ailments...?

32:23.355 --> 32:25.756
You must feel very proud, Agnes.

32:26.957 --> 32:28.997
And utterly terrified.

32:30.158 --> 32:32.440
Gosh. Is it that obvious?

32:35.761 --> 32:37.953
Having a large house
is all well and good,

32:38.003 --> 32:40.524
but one does tend to
rattle around in it.

32:42.924 --> 32:46.118
Anyway, I was going to invite you
to come and stay there.

32:46.168 --> 32:47.808
Just until George returns.

32:48.928 --> 32:50.288
If you'd like?

32:52.250 --> 32:55.571
I'd like that very much.
Splendid, my dear.

32:56.653 --> 32:58.043
Excuse me.
Of course.

32:58.092 --> 33:00.845
Is everything all right?
I must find Victor.

33:00.895 --> 33:02.886
Well he's...

33:02.935 --> 33:04.177
Victor!

33:05.656 --> 33:08.618
Its Uncle Gio, he's collapsed.

33:09.778 --> 33:13.411
You know what?
I think we pulled it off.

33:13.460 --> 33:16.732
Indeed. Yet it still leaves us
with a problem.

33:16.782 --> 33:19.534
Who will replace them?
Not to fear.

33:19.583 --> 33:21.305
Mr Grove has it in hand.

33:22.746 --> 33:25.467
Read all about it!

33:38.273 --> 33:40.275
You'll be hearing from me.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.991
Women?!

33:53.041 --> 33:54.352
Women.

33:54.402 --> 33:56.273
In the loading bay?

33:56.323 --> 33:59.354
In the loading bay, in the kitchens,
driving the lorries.

33:59.403 --> 34:01.995
And this was all Mr Selfridge's idea?

34:02.046 --> 34:04.517
"If my wife's friends can do it,
anyone can."

34:04.567 --> 34:06.599
That's a direct quote
from the Chief.

34:06.648 --> 34:08.679
They're to step in
until the men return.

34:08.728 --> 34:11.280
Every job in the store is available
to both men and women.

34:11.330 --> 34:13.802
That advertisement goes in tomorrow.

34:13.851 --> 34:15.212
Women?!

34:23.697 --> 34:25.016
I'm sorry...

34:30.741 --> 34:32.931
What did the doctor say?

34:32.982 --> 34:34.862
It's a heart attack.

34:35.902 --> 34:39.813
It's a wonderful idea, Miss Mardle.
We must all help as much as we can.

34:39.864 --> 34:43.335
I have room to spare and refugees
don't have a roof over their heads.

34:43.386 --> 34:45.818
You seem to know
an awful lot about it?

34:45.868 --> 34:47.579
It seemed the least I could do.

34:47.628 --> 34:50.659
Monsieur Neuhaus spoke to me at
great length about their problems.

34:50.710 --> 34:53.592
Clearly a most sensitive man.

34:58.073 --> 34:59.955
Vittorio.

35:01.156 --> 35:02.997
Here, Uncle.

35:04.758 --> 35:06.508
The doctor?

35:06.559 --> 35:08.520
Gone, Uncle.

35:12.241 --> 35:13.842
This is nothing.

35:15.683 --> 35:19.564
Something I have eaten
that didn't agree with me.

35:21.006 --> 35:23.847
But, until I am well again...

35:28.409 --> 35:29.931
..you will stay?

35:31.491 --> 35:34.172
Take charge of this family.

35:35.693 --> 35:37.655
Of course, Uncle.

35:39.255 --> 35:41.416
You promise me this?

35:46.138 --> 35:48.340
I promise.

36:20.196 --> 36:21.706
Victor!

36:48.610 --> 36:50.002
You're turning in?

36:50.051 --> 36:52.203
Would you say goodnight
to Henri for me?

36:52.252 --> 36:53.684
Of course I will.

36:53.733 --> 36:56.285
I can barely
keep my eyes open.

36:56.335 --> 36:58.335
I don't know how your ladies manage.

37:01.417 --> 37:04.089
I had such a wonderful day.

37:04.139 --> 37:07.650
Thank you for making it possible.

37:07.701 --> 37:11.623
How could any sane man refuse the
request of such a beautiful woman?

37:13.583 --> 37:15.224
You're incorrigible.

37:16.465 --> 37:18.587
I'm in love.

37:47.841 --> 37:49.151
Incorrigible!

38:32.583 --> 38:34.094
Thank you.

38:34.144 --> 38:36.655
So, you meant it.
Every job kept open?

38:36.705 --> 38:39.377
No exceptions.
It'll cause a stir.

38:39.427 --> 38:42.018
So, you'll put it
in your new column?

38:42.069 --> 38:44.780
Let Selfridges lead the way,
set the example.

38:44.830 --> 38:48.622
These are our boys, Frank,
they're fighting for us.

38:48.671 --> 38:50.383
And dying for us.

38:50.433 --> 38:55.225
There's news from Mons.
Reports of many dead.

38:55.275 --> 38:58.517
Hundreds, maybe more. It was a rout.

39:00.078 --> 39:03.509
You're quite sure?
These are reliable sources.

39:03.559 --> 39:06.070
Men on the ground
I'd trust with my life.

39:06.121 --> 39:07.352
The worst of it?

39:07.402 --> 39:10.513
Churchill and Kitchener
won't let me write the truth.

39:10.563 --> 39:13.044
Press Bureau! Suppress Bureau!

39:14.245 --> 39:18.197
Our men have a right to know
what they're marching into.

39:18.247 --> 39:20.328
This is censorship, pure and simple.

39:22.650 --> 39:24.650
One battle does not make a war.

39:26.291 --> 39:29.693
They probably have good reason.
You approve of this?

39:33.534 --> 39:36.726
Men need leaders,
inspirational leaders.

39:36.777 --> 39:38.807
So you'd make fools of them?

39:38.857 --> 39:42.409
The merest hint of uncertainty
will wreck morale.

39:42.459 --> 39:45.090
They need to believe.
- Or we make them believe?

39:45.141 --> 39:48.783
I'm sorry, Harry, but this time
you and I will have to differ.

39:49.982 --> 39:52.455
I'll run your story.

39:52.504 --> 39:55.216
Right now it's the only one I've got.

39:55.266 --> 39:57.947
Can't say he didn't warn us.

39:58.988 --> 40:00.738
Every day the same.

40:00.789 --> 40:03.421
"I'm dying, Vittorio."

40:03.470 --> 40:05.551
Silly, old fool.

40:07.832 --> 40:10.464
He made me promise to stay here.

40:10.513 --> 40:12.395
His last wish.

40:13.475 --> 40:17.988
Your family need you.
Franco, Gabriella...

40:18.038 --> 40:20.429
Anyway, I don't think
I could have managed

40:20.479 --> 40:24.551
to say goodbye to both you
and George on the same day.

40:24.601 --> 40:27.322
At least this way
I get to keep one of you.

40:29.403 --> 40:31.124
I'm no coward, Agnes.

40:32.725 --> 40:34.486
I know that.

40:41.129 --> 40:43.571
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

40:44.731 --> 40:47.442
Erm... Here... I, I should go.

40:47.492 --> 40:50.174
This is a time for family.

40:51.534 --> 40:54.417
I'll let Mr Grove know
about your loss.

41:09.024 --> 41:10.264
You love her.

41:37.878 --> 41:40.310
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

41:40.360 --> 41:43.231
Thank you. For the drink and...

41:43.281 --> 41:44.681
..and the story.

41:47.683 --> 41:49.994
It's late. What did he want?

41:50.044 --> 41:53.076
Oh, nothing,
just a quote for his new column.

41:53.125 --> 41:56.048
You know me,
can never resist publicity.

41:57.288 --> 41:59.010
Night, Pa.
Good night, son.

42:06.013 --> 42:07.294
I'm going out.

42:08.293 --> 42:09.885
To the pub?

42:09.935 --> 42:11.655
We're celebrating.

42:12.656 --> 42:15.697
Well, not like that, you're not.

42:16.818 --> 42:18.250
Aggie!
George Towler!

42:18.298 --> 42:20.940
I've looked after for you for years,
I'm not about to stop!

42:22.740 --> 42:27.544
I just hope your uniform fits you
better than your coat does.

42:31.305 --> 42:33.546
I'm going to miss you.

42:36.108 --> 42:38.019
I'll miss you, too.

42:38.069 --> 42:42.061
You might be all I've got,
but you're all I've ever needed.

42:42.111 --> 42:43.271
You know that?

42:48.154 --> 42:49.435
You'll do.

42:50.876 --> 42:53.146
Just promise me one thing.

42:53.196 --> 42:54.507
What's that?

42:54.557 --> 42:56.638
Come home to me.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.682
I promise.

43:02.305 --> 43:08.744
