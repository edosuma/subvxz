[grandpa snoring]

01:48.630 --> 01:51.372
[water splashing]

01:52.329 --> 01:54.157
- You're such a good boy, Max.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.680
Yes, you are.

01:55.724 --> 01:56.986
Oh, you like that name?

01:57.029 --> 01:57.987
Do you?

01:58.030 --> 01:59.771
Me too.

01:59.815 --> 02:02.470
[water splashing]

02:04.341 --> 02:05.603
[Amanda blowing shampoo]

02:05.647 --> 02:06.996
- Yeah, no.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.128
No, no.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.303
- Looks like you have a wig,

02:09.346 --> 02:11.174
when you have that
much soap on your head.

02:11.218 --> 02:15.744
[Amanda blowing shampoo]
[Amanda giggling]

02:15.787 --> 02:16.527
- Flowers.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.793
- Max, you look so squeaky clean

02:21.837 --> 02:23.752
for when my dad first sees you.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.234
- I'm home.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.193
Amanda?

02:30.237 --> 02:31.455
- [Weatherman On TV]
The good news is,

02:31.499 --> 02:33.153
it's not cold enough
to make any snow.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.155
It's gonna be mainly
rain, even on Saturday.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.591
- Amanda?

[atmospheric piano music]

02:41.987 --> 02:43.206
- Huh?
- Dad?

02:43.250 --> 02:45.556
You'll never guess
what happened.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.863
- Well, did it
involve a tornado?

02:47.906 --> 02:49.821
Dad, you alive over there?

02:49.865 --> 02:50.605
- What?

02:52.781 --> 02:54.478
Huh, what happened in here?
[dog panting]

02:54.522 --> 02:56.785
- Yeah, that's what
I would like to know.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.526
What the?
- Is that a dog?

02:58.569 --> 03:00.223
- Yeah, Dad, it's a dog.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
A dog in my house
with my daughter.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.922
You know, the
granddaughter in the house

03:03.966 --> 03:05.097
you're supposed to be watching?

03:05.141 --> 03:07.578
- Don't worry, it's just Max.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.014
He likes you.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.626
He looked so sad when I
found him, I had to help.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.280
- What were you thinking?

03:13.323 --> 03:15.499
- That maybe we could keep him?

03:16.805 --> 03:17.675
- You're joking, right?

03:17.719 --> 03:19.895
- I just had a little nap.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.985
- I promise I'll take good
care of him, please, Dad?

03:23.028 --> 03:26.858
He's, he's a stray, and he's
got nowhere else to go, please?

03:28.033 --> 03:29.078
- A stray, huh?

03:34.779 --> 03:36.955
You mean that kinda stray?

03:36.999 --> 03:38.174
- Oh. [chuckling nervously]

03:38.218 --> 03:42.483
[atmospheric piano music]
[dog panting]

03:42.526 --> 03:44.311
- Call me if I can
lend a hand, son.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.181
- Thanks, Dad.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.096
- Bye, Grandpa.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.235
[atmospheric piano music]

03:55.278 --> 03:56.105
- I can't thank you enough.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.672
We were so worried about him.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.978
- That's not a problem, Amanda
deserves all the credit.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.153
She's the one that found him.

04:01.197 --> 04:03.155
- [Boy] Thank you
for finding our dog.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.984
You can come play with
us sometime if you want?

04:06.028 --> 04:08.073
C'mon, Bernie, let's go play

04:08.117 --> 04:11.251
[Bernie panting]

04:11.294 --> 04:13.992
[birds chirping]

04:16.168 --> 04:18.693
- I know you're upset,
but I really need to know

04:18.736 --> 04:20.085
that whenever I'm out
meeting with a client,

04:20.129 --> 04:21.348
you're gonna be responsible,

04:21.391 --> 04:23.785
and I'm not gonna come
home to a trashed house.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.395
Can I count on ya?

04:25.439 --> 04:26.266
- Yes.

04:27.615 --> 04:28.877
- You sure?

04:28.920 --> 04:30.922
Because you and I both
know that Grandpa's

04:30.966 --> 04:33.229
just gonna fall
asleep in that chair.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.491
I can always get Mrs. Crabtree

04:34.535 --> 04:36.188
to come over and
watch you instead.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.278
- No, I like Grandpa.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.324
It won't happen again.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.891
- Okay.

04:42.934 --> 04:45.067
Well, when you're ready,
clean up the mess you made.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.111
I'm gonna go fix dinner.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.680
- Mom would have wanted a dog.

04:49.724 --> 04:53.118
[atmospheric piano music]

04:57.340 --> 04:58.298
- I know she would have.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.212
I know.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.999
But Mom would have also been
here to help take care of it.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.131
It's just me and you now,

05:06.175 --> 05:08.612
and dogs are a big
responsibility.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.092
You're just not ready yet,

05:10.135 --> 05:12.529
but maybe in a couple of
years when you're older.

05:13.878 --> 05:14.662
- Promise?

05:17.360 --> 05:18.840
- We'll see, kiddo.

05:18.883 --> 05:19.754
[Amanda giggling]

[rabbits trilling]

05:57.269 --> 05:58.793
- C'mon, little dearies.

05:58.836 --> 06:01.012
Everybody come and get
your breakfast now.

06:01.056 --> 06:01.970
Good girls.

[Mrs. Crabtree mimics

06:13.460 --> 06:16.288
- Judge Weartherbee will toss
this suit out in a heartbeat.

06:16.332 --> 06:17.551
- [Amanda] Dad?

06:17.594 --> 06:19.422
- No, that's crazy.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.206
No.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.382
- Dad?

06:22.425 --> 06:25.341
- What, John, John,
hold on second, yeah.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.255
Yeah, I know, hold on a second.

06:26.298 --> 06:27.561
I'm on the on the phone.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.737
- Can I walk with Maggie
over to see Aunt Kathy?

06:29.780 --> 06:31.042
- Fine.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.436
- Okay, have a
good time, Amanda.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.350
Love you, too.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.526
- Look, I just don't think

06:36.570 --> 06:38.789
that Mclean's gonna
agree to that, John.

06:38.833 --> 06:39.921
Yeah.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.444
- Alright, already, let's go.

06:41.488 --> 06:45.100
- When I get older, I'm gonna
have like a gazillion dogs.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.318
- Why?

06:46.362 --> 06:47.755
- Don't you like dogs?

06:47.798 --> 06:50.279
- I like Roscoe,
but he's a pain.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.587
My parents make me
walk him everyday.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.676
And he gets hair everywhere.

06:55.719 --> 06:58.461
Oh, and he stinks really bad.

06:58.505 --> 06:59.723
- He does not.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.333
Don't listen to her, Roscoe.

07:01.377 --> 07:02.465
- Yes, he does.

07:02.509 --> 07:03.988
He's a walking fart machine.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.250
[Amanda laughing]

07:05.294 --> 07:06.077
Trust me.

07:07.470 --> 07:11.039
And when he does his
business, it's totally gross.

07:11.082 --> 07:13.998
- Well, I wouldn't care, I'd
just be happy to have a dog.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.478
Even if it only
had like three legs

07:15.522 --> 07:18.046
or something, I'd
still take care of it.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.178
- Why won't your dad
let you have one?

07:20.222 --> 07:22.833
Is it because of your mom?

07:22.877 --> 07:23.747
- What do you mean?

07:23.791 --> 07:25.183
- I don't know, I thought maybe

07:25.227 --> 07:26.663
because your mom
was a dog trainer,

07:26.707 --> 07:29.361
that dogs made him
feel bad or something.

07:29.405 --> 07:32.452
- Oh, I didn't think about that.

07:33.627 --> 07:34.932
- I'm sorry, we
don't have to talk

07:34.976 --> 07:36.760
about your mom if
you don't want to.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.545
- No, it's okay.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.198
I didn't like it at first.

07:40.242 --> 07:43.071
Especially when I came back
to school after she died.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.768
Everyone was really
nice and everything,

07:44.812 --> 07:48.032
but I really did not
wanna talk about it,

07:48.076 --> 07:50.295
and that's all
they wanted to do.

07:50.339 --> 07:52.384
Now it's just like it helps
me remember her, you know?

07:52.428 --> 07:54.909
I get this warm
feeling inside of me,

07:54.952 --> 07:57.085
like she's looking
down on me from Heaven.

08:01.524 --> 08:05.354
- Well, you can come over and
walk Roscoe anytime you want.

08:05.397 --> 08:07.574
- Really?
- Mm, yeah.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.271
- [Amanda] Thanks.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.273
No.
- Oh, no, squirrel.

08:11.316 --> 08:12.492
[Roscoe barking]
- Maggie.

08:12.535 --> 08:13.623
- Look out for the--

08:13.667 --> 08:14.537
[trash cans clattering]
[Amanda yelping]

08:14.581 --> 08:16.496
Garbage cans.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.542
[atmospheric piano music]

08:19.586 --> 08:20.543
- Hey,

08:22.676 --> 08:25.330
You would never drag my best
friend halfway down the street.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.550
[dog panting]
Would you?

08:30.727 --> 08:32.120
- Just a scratch.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.034
Nothing's broken.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.471
You know, girlie, that's exactly

08:35.515 --> 08:37.255
the kinda thing your
mom would have done.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.780
She used to bring home
all kinds of strays.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.390
- Really?

08:41.433 --> 08:44.654
- Heck, yeah, cats, dogs,
turtles, you name it.

08:44.698 --> 08:47.309
If it needed a home, she
would try and find it one.

08:47.352 --> 08:50.399
She even used her dog sitting
money to have us registered

08:50.442 --> 08:53.271
as an official wildlife
sanctuary with the state.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.359
- She did?

08:54.403 --> 08:56.753
- Yeah, even when we were kids.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.061
No, scratch that,

09:01.541 --> 09:04.500
especially when we were kids.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.417
She always used this
to guide her decisions,

09:09.592 --> 09:10.375
instead of this.

09:12.464 --> 09:16.468
She had the biggest, kindest
heart I've ever known.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.036
- And she loved dogs
the most, right?

09:19.080 --> 09:20.908
- Well there was one
thing she loved more.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.562
- [Amanda] Really? What?

09:22.605 --> 09:23.650
- Us, silly.

09:23.693 --> 09:24.564
Her family.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.653
- [chuckling] Oh, duh.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.527
Dad's not really a
heart guy, is he?

09:31.571 --> 09:32.963
[Kathy chuckling]

09:33.007 --> 09:34.356
- No.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.488
No, he is not.

09:36.532 --> 09:39.622
But I do know that he
loves you just as much.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.232
And if you really want a pet,

09:42.582 --> 09:45.280
you just have to convince him
with a really strong argument.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.936
Show him that you can
take some responsibility,

09:48.979 --> 09:50.111
and he'll come around.

09:50.981 --> 09:51.808
You'll see.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.811
Now my beautiful little niece,

09:54.855 --> 09:56.857
you're just about good to go.

09:56.900 --> 09:57.901
You just need one more thing

09:57.945 --> 10:00.251
before you'll feel 100% better.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.426
You know what that is?

10:02.427 --> 10:03.472
Puppy kisses.

10:03.515 --> 10:04.647
[Amanda laughing]
How 'bout that?

10:04.691 --> 10:05.648
- Heck yeah.

10:05.692 --> 10:06.649
- [Kathy] C'mon.

10:06.693 --> 10:10.348
[atmospheric piano music]

10:14.352 --> 10:17.399
- Here, hey, oh.
[blowing kisses]

10:17.442 --> 10:18.487
[dog panting]

10:18.530 --> 10:19.923
I love you.

10:21.664 --> 10:24.624
[Amanda kissing]

10:35.112 --> 10:36.940
- Are you sure
this time, brother?

10:36.984 --> 10:40.074
- Yes, Dimitri, I see little
kitty, he run that way.

10:41.118 --> 10:41.902
- No,

10:41.945 --> 10:43.120
no.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.034
No, [speaking
foreign language] no.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.950
How many times I
tell you, Boris?

10:46.994 --> 10:47.951
It's not

10:47.995 --> 10:48.952
kitty,

10:48.996 --> 10:50.258
it's kit.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.912
It's English word

10:51.955 --> 10:53.478
kit meaning

10:53.522 --> 10:55.263
small fox.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.699
- This is what I say.

10:56.743 --> 11:00.572
English kit, he run
that way. [laughing]

11:00.616 --> 11:02.096
It rhyme.

11:02.139 --> 11:04.228
This is what I say, English
kit, he run that way.

11:04.272 --> 11:06.840
This is what I say, English
kit, he run that way.

11:06.883 --> 11:07.971
This is--
- Boris?

11:08.015 --> 11:09.103
Get

11:09.146 --> 11:10.539
out.

11:10.582 --> 11:14.195
[upbeat orchestral music]

11:29.514 --> 11:32.822
- [Boris] This is what I say,
English kit, he go this way.

11:37.261 --> 11:38.001
- Excuse me?

11:38.045 --> 11:38.828
You two?

11:40.047 --> 11:42.440
- Hello, kind lady, how
are you doing today?

11:42.484 --> 11:43.790
- Are you from animal control?

11:43.833 --> 11:45.748
You are from animal
control, aren't you?

11:45.792 --> 11:48.620
- Yes, yes, yes, we are
from animal controlling.

11:48.664 --> 11:49.970
- I thought so.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.798
I thought I could feel
some strange creature

11:51.841 --> 11:53.147
watching over me.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.410
I think it might be
after my poor bunnies.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.151
You will protect my
bunnies, won't you?

11:57.194 --> 11:58.805
- Is this bunnies your backside?

11:58.848 --> 12:01.024
- Oh, no, no, no, my rabbits.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.765
They're very special to me.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.071
- Oh, I am understanding,

12:04.114 --> 12:06.290
now this is making
much more sense now.

12:06.334 --> 12:09.511
[rabbits tilling]

12:09.554 --> 12:10.599
- Shh.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.128
Do you like your freedom,
should I just let you go?

12:18.172 --> 12:19.869
Let you run free?

12:19.913 --> 12:20.740
Would you like that?

12:20.783 --> 12:22.132
- That's my Mr. Lincoln.

12:22.176 --> 12:23.525
You can't take him.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.396
- It's misunderstanding.

12:25.440 --> 12:29.226
Boris, give the nice lady
back her Mr. Lincoln,

12:29.270 --> 12:31.359
and we continue our searching.

12:31.402 --> 12:32.664
- No.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.231
- Boris,

12:34.275 --> 12:35.058
give it back.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.713
- [Mrs. Crabtree]
C'mon, little bunny.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.759
C'mon, poor baby, oh,
c'mon, Mr. Lincoln.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.850
Good boy, that's
my bunny, bunny.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.733
- Hey?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.561
You girls be careful,
there's a strange creature

12:59.604 --> 13:00.823
on the loose in
the neighborhood.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.564
- Yes, Mrs. Crabtree.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.827
- And Margaret Cavanaugh,
you see that that dog

13:04.871 --> 13:07.395
of yours doesn't do his
business on my yard again.

13:07.438 --> 13:09.092
- Yes, Mrs. Crabtree.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.790
Sorry, Mrs. Crabtree.

13:14.228 --> 13:15.620
- I'm back.

13:15.664 --> 13:16.839
- Oh, hey, good timing.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.711
So, I was thinking about

13:19.755 --> 13:20.843
what we were talking
about yesterday.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.584
You know, the pet situation?

13:22.627 --> 13:23.759
- Really?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.761
- I do listen to ya, you know?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.329
Anyway, I think I came up
with a good compromise.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.158
Go check your room.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.812
He's waiting for ya.

13:32.855 --> 13:33.900
- Thank you, thank you.

13:33.943 --> 13:37.599
[atmospheric piano music]

13:38.948 --> 13:40.036
Here, boy.

13:40.080 --> 13:40.863
Where are ya boy?

13:40.907 --> 13:41.733
Come on out.

13:41.777 --> 13:44.824
[turtle rustling]

13:57.532 --> 14:00.622
I guess it's the thought
that counts, right Max?

14:00.665 --> 14:02.624
You don't really
seem like a Max.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.670
More like a, I don't know.

14:05.714 --> 14:08.499
Sorry, don't take it personally.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.675
I bet you're a really
nice little guy and all,

14:10.719 --> 14:14.027
it's just, I really
had my heart set on,

14:14.070 --> 14:16.768
well, not a turtle, you know?

14:18.205 --> 14:18.988
Max?

14:19.946 --> 14:21.164
C'mon, Max.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.079
I said, don't take
it personally.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.167
No need to run.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.874
Oh, my gosh.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.179
There's a fox in my yard.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.703
[atmospheric piano music]

14:38.747 --> 14:40.880
There's a fox in my yard.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.500
What does a fox eat?

14:52.543 --> 14:53.414
What does a fox eat?

14:53.457 --> 14:54.937
Where have I heard that before?

14:54.981 --> 14:56.634
What does a, hmm?

14:56.678 --> 14:59.246
[phone beeping]

15:01.857 --> 15:03.685
Maggie, get over to
my house right now.

15:03.728 --> 15:04.816
You'll never guess.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.344
- Amanda, what'd ya think?

15:10.387 --> 15:11.606
- About what?

15:11.649 --> 15:13.042
- The turtle, silly?

15:13.086 --> 15:17.438
- Oh, yeah, um, just getting
him some more lettuce.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.918
I named him Max.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.571
- I'm glad you like him.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.575
- Ah, that's the ticket.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.848
Are you sick, boy?

15:36.892 --> 15:38.633
You don't look sick.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.330
I bet you're the one
those dog catcher's

15:40.374 --> 15:42.289
are looking for, aren't you?

15:42.332 --> 15:43.116
But why?

15:44.421 --> 15:45.945
You wouldn't hurt anybody.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.816
Would you, Maxie?

15:47.859 --> 15:49.774
Do you mind sharing a name, boy?

15:49.818 --> 15:51.820
It fits you better, anyway.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.865
Here, go on, take it.

15:55.606 --> 15:57.826
I probably shouldn't
even be talking to you.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.741
I mean, it's not
like I can keep you.

15:59.784 --> 16:02.439
You're a fox after
all and besides,

16:02.483 --> 16:05.051
if dad found you, I'd
get into so much trouble.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.881
I can't let those
dog catchers get you.

16:09.925 --> 16:12.884
Aunt Kathy says that when animal
control gets wild animals,

16:12.928 --> 16:16.758
they, well, trust me,
it would not be fun.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.761
Let's just say, I
better keep you around

16:19.804 --> 16:22.894
for a few days until
the coast is clear.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.070
How does that sound, Maxie?

16:24.113 --> 16:25.027
Sound good?

16:25.071 --> 16:26.289
- Who are you talking to?

16:27.856 --> 16:32.513
- Oh, hi, Dad, I, um, I was
just talking to Max. [chuckling]

16:33.035 --> 16:33.775
- To Max?

16:33.818 --> 16:35.472
- My turtle, remember?

16:35.516 --> 16:37.822
- Yeah, I remember, he's
right here in the kitchen.

16:37.866 --> 16:38.606
- Yes,

16:38.649 --> 16:40.912
I know, I, um,

16:40.956 --> 16:44.916
I just like to keep the
conversation going, that's all.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.657
- Yeah, well, come in
and get cleaned up.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.572
I'm making a special
dinner for us.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.922
- Okay, I'll be right there.

16:50.966 --> 16:51.749
- Okay.

16:56.537 --> 16:59.670
- I won't let anything happen
to you, Max, I promise.

17:07.113 --> 17:11.856
- I could have sworn that I
bought two chicken breasts.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.510
- It must be old age.

17:13.554 --> 17:15.860
Gettin' forgetful, huh, Dad?

17:15.904 --> 17:16.774
- Yeah, you're
gonna have to put me

17:16.818 --> 17:17.862
in the old folks home soon, huh?

17:17.906 --> 17:20.648
- [laughing] Good one.

17:23.129 --> 17:23.912
- So, ah...

17:28.090 --> 17:29.352
tell me about Max.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.788
- Ah, what about him?

17:30.832 --> 17:32.051
He's fine.

Eating a lot of lettuce.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.880

turtle stuff, you know?

- That's, ah, that's good, yeah.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.675
- Everything okay, Dad?

17:47.718 --> 17:48.763
- What?

17:48.806 --> 17:49.633
Oh,

17:49.677 --> 17:51.374

17:51.418 --> 17:52.288
sorry.

17:52.332 --> 17:54.899
Um, I have something to tell ya,

17:55.813 --> 17:57.641
and I put it off for too long,

17:57.685 --> 18:00.644
and it's, and it's nothing bad.

18:00.688 --> 18:03.125
Um, in fact, it's
actually really good news.

18:03.169 --> 18:03.995
Um,

18:05.127 --> 18:06.128
I'm just not

18:06.172 --> 18:07.999
sure how to tell ya.

Amanda, I--
[doorbell ringing]

18:13.918 --> 18:15.703
- Oh, I forgot, I asked Maggie

18:15.746 --> 18:16.965
if she can come over and play.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.793
Can she stay for dinner?

18:18.836 --> 18:19.620
- Sure.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.409
- Thanks for letting
me stay, Your Honor.

18:26.453 --> 18:29.195
My mom always says it's rude
to invite myself for dinner.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.892
- Oh, I'm not a judge, Maggie.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.763
You don't have to
call me, Your Honor.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.896
- Well, my dad says that
you will be one soon,

18:34.939 --> 18:37.028
so we better start
getting on your good side.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.769
Especially since we put
in our pool last summer,

18:38.813 --> 18:40.423
and we didn't get
a permit for it.

18:41.859 --> 18:44.253
Well, I guess I wasn't
supposed to tell anyone that.

18:44.297 --> 18:48.039
- Well, consider it bound by
attorney/client privilege.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.040
I won't tell a soul.

18:49.084 --> 18:50.520
- Really? Thanks, Your Honor.

18:54.481 --> 18:57.136
- So, what is it that you
wanted to tell me, Dad?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.964
- Oh, that, that can wait.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.663
- But you said it couldn't wait?

19:03.968 --> 19:07.146
- [sighing] I guess
I did, didn't I?

35:35.785 --> 35:39.746
And absolutely, positively
not Mrs. Crabtree.

35:39.789 --> 35:42.096
So no more stealing
wigs, got it?

35:42.140 --> 35:43.271
[Max whimpering]
Good.

35:44.664 --> 35:47.057
[atmospheric harp music]

35:47.101 --> 35:47.884
- Amanda?

35:48.972 --> 35:50.452
Amanda, it's time to get up.

35:51.801 --> 35:54.978
- Mom, I have such
wonderful news.

35:55.022 --> 35:56.632
I found him.

35:56.676 --> 35:57.851
- Who, Amanda?

35:57.894 --> 36:00.158
- Max, I found Max, Mom.

36:00.201 --> 36:02.551
- Oh, I'm so happy for you.

36:02.595 --> 36:04.423
You have to meet him,
I know you'll love him

36:04.466 --> 36:05.728
as much as I do.

36:07.426 --> 36:09.079
I swear he was right,

36:10.124 --> 36:11.169
Mom?

36:12.257 --> 36:14.259
He was right there a second ago.

36:14.302 --> 36:15.129
Really.

36:16.261 --> 36:17.914
- [Mother] Where's Max, Amanda?

36:19.351 --> 36:20.178
- Mom?

36:24.617 --> 36:25.705
[knocking on door]

36:25.748 --> 36:29.012
[Max whimpering]

36:29.056 --> 36:30.362
I'll be down in a minute.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.059
- [Erika] Amanda?

36:32.102 --> 36:33.365
May I come in?

36:33.408 --> 36:34.975
- Ah, just one second.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.499
[knocking on door]

36:37.543 --> 36:39.153
- I'd really like to
talk to you, okay?

36:45.159 --> 36:45.986
What are you up to?

36:46.029 --> 36:48.162
- Nothing, just playing.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.513
Ah, we can go downstairs,
if you'd like to?

36:51.557 --> 36:54.037
- Oh, no, right
here's just fine.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.300
- Stop.

36:55.343 --> 36:58.825
Um, that's where Mr.
Sparkles likes to sit.

36:58.868 --> 37:02.002
- Oh, [chuckling] of course.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.266
- What is it that you
wanted to talk about?

37:05.310 --> 37:09.444
- I, there's something
I wanted to say to you,

37:09.488 --> 37:12.012
but you were [sniffing],
you were in such a hurry,

37:12.055 --> 37:15.450
I didn't get the chan,
cha... [sneezing]

37:15.494 --> 37:16.277
Uh.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.366
Oh, excuse me.

37:18.410 --> 37:22.283
I'm sorry, ah, must be
something in the air.

37:23.153 --> 37:24.198
Anyway,

37:25.678 --> 37:28.550
I want you to know, that I
love your father very much,

37:28.594 --> 37:30.596
and I want to marry
him, but [sneezing].

37:33.555 --> 37:38.168
Um, do you mind grabbing
one of those for me?

37:38.212 --> 37:40.127
I don't know what my problem is.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.171
- Oh,

37:41.215 --> 37:42.695
okay.

37:42.738 --> 37:46.264
Have you had any
dogs in here lately?

37:46.307 --> 37:49.528
I usually only get this
way around cats and dogs.

37:49.571 --> 37:51.573
- What, get what way?

37:51.617 --> 37:54.272
- I'm very allergic to animals.

37:54.315 --> 37:55.838
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

37:55.882 --> 37:57.666
Sometimes dangerously so, it

37:57.710 --> 38:00.147
it depends on the animal.

38:00.190 --> 38:01.627
- Oh.

38:01.670 --> 38:04.194
Oh, I just remembered,

38:04.238 --> 38:06.196
I had Bernie up
here a few days ago.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.285
He was a stray

38:07.328 --> 38:08.198
I found, well,
- Oh.

38:08.242 --> 38:09.504
[Max whimpering]
He turned out

38:09.548 --> 38:12.290
just to be lost, but I
let him get on my bed.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.421
- Well, I'll wash your

38:13.465 --> 38:15.075
blankets for you.
- No, no, no, no, no,

38:15.118 --> 38:16.555
it's, it's, okay.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.252
Uh, Dad's always saying

38:18.296 --> 38:20.254
that I should take
more responsibility.

38:23.213 --> 38:25.433
- Amanda, I want you to know,

38:25.477 --> 38:29.307
that I can never
replace your mother.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.220
I wouldn't want to,

38:31.396 --> 38:34.094
but I hope we can
become close, alright?

38:36.662 --> 38:38.403
Oh. [chuckling]

38:38.446 --> 38:39.229
Okay.

38:40.187 --> 38:41.319
Good.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.624
[atmospheric orchestral music]

38:42.668 --> 38:43.451
Um,

38:44.974 --> 38:47.325
I'll go make us some
breakfast, okay.

38:47.368 --> 38:48.413
Ah, eggs sound good?

38:48.456 --> 38:51.285
- Yes, yeah.
- Alright, okay, yeah.

38:59.162 --> 39:02.296
- Good morning, Max.
[Max whimpering]

39:02.340 --> 39:04.254
[atmospheric orchestral music]

39:04.298 --> 39:06.779
Don't worry, I'll
figure something out.

39:06.822 --> 39:09.259
Maybe she can get
shots or something,

39:09.303 --> 39:11.349
but until then it
would probably be best

39:11.392 --> 39:13.133
if I kept you in the backyard,

39:13.176 --> 39:14.352
but don't worry, I'll come out

39:14.395 --> 39:15.962
and play with you every hour.

39:23.752 --> 39:26.451
- Don't you like your eggs?

39:26.494 --> 39:28.322
- Ah, yeah, sure.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.151
- You haven't eaten very much.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.372
- I guess I'm not as
hungry as I thought I was.

39:38.811 --> 39:40.290
[door clicks open]

39:40.334 --> 39:42.031
- You know, when I
was a little girl,

39:42.075 --> 39:44.425
I didn't meet my aunt
until I was about your age.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.296
- Really, why not?

39:46.340 --> 39:48.037
- She was in the military.

39:48.081 --> 39:50.910
Stationed all over the world.

39:50.953 --> 39:53.434
And I remember being really
worried about meeting her.

39:53.478 --> 39:58.047
I mean, here is this woman
who had traveled the globe,

39:58.091 --> 40:00.702
she had had all
these experiences.

40:00.746 --> 40:03.183
I didn't even know how
to act in front of her.

40:03.226 --> 40:05.533
She must have been able
to tell I was nervous

40:05.577 --> 40:07.274
because the first thing she did

40:07.317 --> 40:10.277
was ask me if I
wanted to play a game.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.278
- What kind of game?

40:11.321 --> 40:14.020
- Oh, it's simple, really.

40:14.063 --> 40:15.369
You take the other
person's hand,

40:15.413 --> 40:17.545
and then you share
something about yourself,

40:17.589 --> 40:22.158
that you're normally too shy
or embarrassed to tell people.

40:22.202 --> 40:25.074
Or maybe it's
something personal.

40:25.118 --> 40:25.988
For instance,

40:27.860 --> 40:30.428
even though I love
being a lawyer,

40:30.471 --> 40:33.909
anytime I have to go to
court and talk in front

40:33.953 --> 40:36.738
of a jury, I get
very, very nervous.

40:36.782 --> 40:37.696
- Really?

40:37.739 --> 40:40.307
- Mm, my palms start sweating.

40:40.350 --> 40:42.483
My mind, it goes
completely blank,

40:42.527 --> 40:45.747
and then, I start stuttering,

40:45.791 --> 40:49.229
tha-a-a-nk you, Your H-H-Honor.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.449
[Amanda laughing]
[Erika laughing]

40:51.492 --> 40:55.148
I can research a case
like nobody's business,

40:55.191 --> 40:57.019
but I'm completely useless

40:57.063 --> 40:58.891
as a lead attorney
in the courtroom.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.459
Okay, your turn.

41:02.329 --> 41:03.373
- Well,

41:04.287 --> 41:06.420
I guess there's Max.

41:07.247 --> 41:09.162
- Is he a boy you know?

41:09.205 --> 41:10.163
- No,

41:10.206 --> 41:11.773
he's a dog.

41:11.817 --> 41:12.861
Well,

41:12.905 --> 41:13.688
he was

41:13.732 --> 41:15.168
a dog.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.605
He was my mom's first show dog.

41:17.649 --> 41:19.389
He was really smart, I guess.

41:19.433 --> 41:21.522
He won best of breed.
- Mm.

41:21.566 --> 41:22.828
- She said after he died,

41:22.871 --> 41:24.873
she never had a dog
as smart as him.

41:26.135 --> 41:28.094
Sometimes I'd sit with
her during her chemo,

41:28.137 --> 41:32.272
and we'd talk about how we'd
get another dog someday.

41:32.315 --> 41:33.795
Name him Max.

41:33.839 --> 41:35.014
We'd train him together.

41:35.057 --> 41:36.537
Just her and me.

41:36.581 --> 41:37.973
He'd be the best dog ever.

41:40.236 --> 41:42.456
- That was a wonderful
story, Amanda.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.284
Thank you for
sharing it with me.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.722
- Sometimes I have dreams
where she's asking me

41:47.766 --> 41:50.246
if I've found Max yet.

41:50.290 --> 41:52.727
Usually I feel bad
because I haven't,

41:52.771 --> 41:55.687
but at least I get
to see her, you know?

41:55.730 --> 41:58.472
[atmospheric orchestral music]

41:58.516 --> 42:00.300
- Someday you'll find your Max.

42:00.343 --> 42:01.040
I'm sure.

42:03.303 --> 42:04.347
- Erika?

42:04.391 --> 42:05.392
- Hmm?

42:05.435 --> 42:07.002
- There's probably another Max

42:07.046 --> 42:09.875
that I should tell you about.

42:09.918 --> 42:11.877
- Boy or dog?

42:11.920 --> 42:12.704
- Neither.

42:15.445 --> 42:16.664
- [Erika] A fox?

42:20.842 --> 42:21.930
- A fox?

42:23.628 --> 42:25.804
I am literally
speechless right now.

42:25.847 --> 42:27.588
I have no idea what to say.

42:27.632 --> 42:28.850
- For what it's worth,

42:28.894 --> 42:30.069
I wouldn't have let
her bring it home

42:30.112 --> 42:31.200
if I thought the
animal was going to--

42:31.244 --> 42:32.724
- His name is Max.

42:34.421 --> 42:36.728
- I wouldn't have let
her bring Max home,

42:36.771 --> 42:39.600
if I thought it was the
least bit dangerous,

42:39.644 --> 42:42.472
but she was supposed to
clear this with both of you.

42:42.516 --> 42:43.386
- Uh, but--

42:43.430 --> 42:44.736
- No, not a word, Amanda.

42:44.779 --> 42:45.563
Where is it now?

42:46.433 --> 42:47.913
- May I say a word?

42:50.480 --> 42:52.047
In his crate in the backyard.

42:55.007 --> 42:56.312
- I'll keep the little guy

42:56.356 --> 42:57.575
until we can find
him a good home.

43:01.579 --> 43:04.103
- I am so disappointed in you.

43:05.844 --> 43:07.715
You have anything
to say for yourself?

43:09.325 --> 43:11.545
- I wanted to show you that
I could take responsibility.

43:13.068 --> 43:17.377
- By hiding a stray animal in
our backyard, in our house?

43:17.420 --> 43:20.423
By lying to us, that
kind of responsibility?

43:20.467 --> 43:21.947
- Sorry.

43:21.990 --> 43:24.645
- Sorry's not gonna cut
it this time, kiddo.

43:24.689 --> 43:25.777
Go to your room until I decide

43:25.820 --> 43:27.517
what your punishment's gonna be.

43:27.561 --> 43:29.389
- Could I at least say goodbye?

43:30.303 --> 43:31.086
- Peter?

43:33.959 --> 43:34.829
- He's gone.

I wanted you, ah.

- Idiot.

44:02.335 --> 44:06.469
Hey, look at that, what do
you think they're looking for?

44:06.513 --> 44:09.603
- I don't, they, they look
for, for, lost doggie, maybe?

44:09.647 --> 44:12.127
- No, I think this is girl.

44:12.171 --> 44:14.608
The, the other one, the
friend with the mean dog.

44:14.652 --> 44:16.001
- I don't like that dog.

- Huh, oh, that's the girl
where we think we see.

44:26.228 --> 44:27.360
- Ow.

- Allergic?

44:29.188 --> 44:30.015
That's too bad.

know each other better.

44:40.678 --> 44:41.591
As family.

44:41.635 --> 44:42.680
- I'd like that

44:43.942 --> 44:44.725
very much.

44:49.991 --> 44:52.515
I hope Peter's not
too hard on her.

44:52.559 --> 44:54.039
Her heart's in the right place.

44:54.082 --> 44:57.738
- I know, I know, she told
me about your sister and Max.

44:57.782 --> 45:00.001
I wish there was something
I could do about it.

45:00.045 --> 45:02.612
- [Boris] Hello, kind ladies.

45:02.656 --> 45:04.484
- How you doing today?

45:04.527 --> 45:05.877
Not to be afraid.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.488
We see that you are
searching for something.

45:08.531 --> 45:10.751
What is it that you
are searching for?

45:10.795 --> 45:14.146
- My stepdaughter lost
her pet, that's all.

45:14.189 --> 45:16.888
- Oh, oh, well we
too are searching,

45:16.931 --> 45:18.716
and you know, you
must be careful

45:18.759 --> 45:22.632
because we are searching
for dangerous fox.

45:22.676 --> 45:24.722
Maybe you'll be seeing it, uh?

45:24.765 --> 45:25.766
- No,

I haven't seen

Mm.

Well, okay, well if
you be seeing it,

45:53.489 --> 45:56.275
- They're definitely not animal
control, that's for sure.

45:57.580 --> 45:59.626
I have a feeling we better
find Max before they do.

46:02.194 --> 46:05.197
[crickets chirping]

46:14.206 --> 46:15.511
- I'm sure he'll be okay.

46:16.599 --> 46:19.472
Heck, if he's half as
smart as you say he is,

46:19.515 --> 46:20.473
he'll probably end up back in

46:20.516 --> 46:22.083
his crate by the
morning, anyway.

46:24.694 --> 46:25.913
You do know, though,

46:25.957 --> 46:28.046
if he comes back, we
can't keep him, right?

46:29.787 --> 46:31.658
- Cause of Erika?

46:31.701 --> 46:32.441
- No.

46:32.485 --> 46:33.747
Well um, sort of,

46:33.791 --> 46:37.142
but mostly it's
because he's a fox.

46:39.100 --> 46:40.928
I mean, even if you did
decide to raise him as a pet,

46:40.972 --> 46:43.191
you know, they're not like dogs.

46:43.235 --> 46:44.802
They need a lot more room,

46:44.845 --> 46:47.065
and they need a lot more care
and a lot more attention.

46:47.108 --> 46:48.457
Or at least I think they do,

46:48.501 --> 46:51.634
I don't know, I mean
he's a fox. [chuckling]

46:51.678 --> 46:53.114
It's just not in the cards.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.944
You know, not until
you're much, much older

46:56.988 --> 46:59.381
can you decide
whether you're ready

46:59.425 --> 47:00.730
to take that much responsibility

47:00.774 --> 47:02.254
for another living creature.

47:04.734 --> 47:06.214
You know,

47:06.258 --> 47:07.041
sometimes

47:08.521 --> 47:11.829
doing what's right for someone
or something, you know,

47:11.872 --> 47:14.788
it feels like we're not doing
the right thing for ourselves.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.094
I didn't wanna get on a plane,

47:16.137 --> 47:19.706
and go to Chicago for a
pro bono job, you know?

47:21.882 --> 47:22.927
But,

47:22.970 --> 47:23.797
Mr. Olivier's,

47:25.538 --> 47:29.194
really nice man, and if
I didn't help him out,

47:29.237 --> 47:30.586
he would lose the
bakery that he spent

47:30.630 --> 47:32.806
his entire life trying to build,

47:32.850 --> 47:34.939
and then he and his family,
they would have nothing.

47:36.418 --> 47:37.898
And going to Chicago meant
that I would have to leave you,

47:37.942 --> 47:40.031
but I knew it was the
right thing to do.

47:40.074 --> 47:41.119
Does that make sense?

47:44.862 --> 47:47.908
- I promised I wouldn't let
anything bad happen to Max.

47:50.041 --> 47:51.912
- Well, I'll tell you what,

47:51.956 --> 47:54.741
you know, Aunty Kathy
will take care of him

47:54.784 --> 47:56.308
until we find a place for him,

47:56.351 --> 47:58.092
and you can help her.

47:58.136 --> 48:00.138
And then we won't
give him to anyone

48:00.181 --> 48:02.009
until they promise
that you can visit.

48:03.663 --> 48:05.708
How's that sound?
Is that a deal?

48:05.752 --> 48:06.753
- Really?
- Really.

48:11.932 --> 48:12.715
Hmm.

48:15.066 --> 48:17.285
[sighing]

48:18.286 --> 48:19.766
Goodnight, kiddo.

48:19.809 --> 48:20.593

49:00.763 --> 49:02.983
- [Dimitri] Boris, we've
got to get this fox,

49:03.027 --> 49:05.768
otherwise we're gonna be
really in big trouble.

49:07.031 --> 49:10.164
You know why? Because we put
too much moneys for this.

49:10.208 --> 49:11.078
Now what we gonna do?

49:11.122 --> 49:11.949
Hey.

49:13.037 --> 49:13.951
Watch, okay?

49:15.343 --> 49:16.475
- Okay.
- We going to be in big

49:16.518 --> 49:18.216
troubles because

49:18.259 --> 49:21.306
we gonna have to
hitchhike back to Russia.

49:21.349 --> 49:22.089
Is that what you want?

49:22.133 --> 49:23.351
- [Boris] No.

49:23.395 --> 49:24.744
- [Dimitri] Then no
more stupid stuff, okay?

49:24.787 --> 49:26.050
- [Boris] Okay.

49:28.661 --> 49:29.836
- [Dimitri] Watch it.

49:29.879 --> 49:31.794
It's what I'm telling
you, no stupid.

49:31.838 --> 49:32.970
C'mon now, pay attention.

49:33.013 --> 49:33.796
- Don't

49:33.840 --> 49:35.363
call me names.

49:35.407 --> 49:36.495
- [Dimitri] Alright,
but you got to--

49:36.538 --> 49:37.757
- I don't like names.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.759
- Stop, keep moving,
look for fox.

49:39.802 --> 49:43.981
[atmospheric orchestral music]

49:47.723 --> 49:52.424
Boris, I tell you
how many times?

49:52.467 --> 49:53.381
How many times I tell you?

49:53.425 --> 49:54.992
What's a matter with you now?

49:56.515 --> 49:58.212
- I believe it is you
who is watching now, huh?

49:58.256 --> 49:59.779
- Are you crazy?

49:59.822 --> 50:01.476
Get that outta my face.

50:01.520 --> 50:02.303
Help me up now.

50:09.484 --> 50:10.920
How are you doing tonight?

50:10.964 --> 50:13.053
- USA, number one. [laughing]

Max?

- [Mrs. Crabtree] My bunnies.

50:46.521 --> 50:48.610
[atmospheric piano music]

50:48.654 --> 50:50.699
- Mrs. Crabtree, what?

50:50.743 --> 50:51.483
Oh, no.

50:53.441 --> 50:55.095
- Some of the little
ones are gone.

50:56.227 --> 50:57.445
My poor bunnies.

50:59.143 --> 51:01.014
It was that wicked
fox, I know it was.

51:01.058 --> 51:03.016
They warned us how
dangerous it is.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.018
- No, Mrs. Crabtree, it
couldn't have been him.

51:05.062 --> 51:05.888
He would never do

51:05.932 --> 51:07.064
something like--
- Amanda.

51:07.107 --> 51:08.152
- But?

51:08.195 --> 51:10.067
- Look, we don't
know what happened,

51:10.110 --> 51:11.329
and foxes do eat rabbits.

51:11.372 --> 51:12.678
We have to assume--
- He would never do

51:12.721 --> 51:13.505
something like this.

51:13.548 --> 51:14.941
He wouldn't.

51:34.743 --> 51:35.657
Would you like a snack?

51:35.701 --> 51:37.050
- I'm okay.

51:42.186 --> 51:44.927
- Well, if you need anything,
you let me know, okay?

51:44.971 --> 51:47.234
I called the real animal
control an hour ago,

51:47.278 --> 51:49.715
but you keep an eye out
for that vicious beast.

51:53.501 --> 51:55.721
- You'd never do
anything like this, Max.

51:55.764 --> 51:57.418
I know you wouldn't.

yet, but I'll prove it.

52:36.457 --> 52:38.242
- It's just a
tranquilizer gun, alright?

52:38.285 --> 52:41.070
- Two for two.
- He was protecting us.

52:41.114 --> 52:42.637
- Oh, it's okay,
hon, it's over now.

52:42.681 --> 52:44.378
It will be okay.

alright, it's alright.

52:49.992 --> 52:53.648
[birds chirping]

52:53.692 --> 52:55.868
- Alright, so, I just
got off the phone

52:55.911 --> 52:57.086
with the county shelter,

52:57.130 --> 52:59.176
and they have minimal
staff on the weekend,

52:59.219 --> 53:01.395
so Max will be fine
until the work week,

53:01.439 --> 53:04.224
but if there's no
court order by Monday--

53:04.268 --> 53:05.834
- They'll put him down.

53:05.878 --> 53:06.705
- I'm afraid so.

53:07.706 --> 53:09.142
- But, you have to stop them.

- Oh, honey, I'm
sorry, but I have

53:11.362 --> 53:13.407
to get back on a
plane to Chicago.

53:13.451 --> 53:15.104
Mr. Olivier's case is on Monday.

53:15.148 --> 53:18.020
- No, you can't, Max needs you.

Hold on, I'm not sure that
you're aware of this or not,

one of the best lawyers

right next to ya.

seen me in court.

53:35.342 --> 53:37.083
for you to be lead
counsel on this.

53:39.172 --> 53:40.086
- Who then?

53:40.129 --> 53:41.348
- You wanted to prove to me

53:41.392 --> 53:42.654
that you could take
responsibility, right?

53:42.697 --> 53:44.003
That you could handle this?

- No, no buts.

53:55.144 --> 53:56.407
Do you wanna save Max or not?

Then this is your
moment, Amanda.

54:00.106 --> 54:02.543
You are a bright,
intelligent young lady,

54:03.762 --> 54:05.807
and if you put half the
energy into saving Max

54:05.851 --> 54:08.157
as you did into
hiding him from us,

54:08.201 --> 54:09.768
he'll be free in no time.

with you the entire way.

- You can do this.

54:14.512 --> 54:15.339
I know you can.

- Then what are we waiting for?

Let's get this party started.

- That's my girl.

Alright.
- Alright, excellent.

- Alright.
- Alright.

- Okay.

- Good, let's get to work.

heavy lifting alright.

54:37.099 --> 54:39.101
- It's not as bad as it looks.

54:39.145 --> 54:42.104
We just need to take
this one step at a time,

54:42.148 --> 54:44.368
and our first priority,
is to convince

54:44.411 --> 54:45.717
Judge Weartherbee that we need

54:45.760 --> 54:48.110
a few days to put
our case together.

54:48.154 --> 54:50.112
That will also buy Max
a little more time.

54:50.156 --> 54:51.462
- And then what?

54:51.505 --> 54:53.942
- Then we develop an
argument as to why

54:53.986 --> 54:56.554
Max isn't a menace and
danger to the community.

54:56.597 --> 54:58.860
If the judge agrees,
he'll let Max go free.

54:59.992 --> 55:01.994
- And if he doesn't?

55:02.037 --> 55:03.604
- One step at a time, remember?

Hey?

Hey?

55:08.174 --> 55:09.871
Don't underestimate
the sheer awesomeness

of our secret weapon.

absolute best to prepare?

Then you're going to
do great tomorrow.

to have found you, too.

57:10.427 --> 57:11.471
- All rise.

57:15.432 --> 57:17.869
The Court of the Honorable,
Wilfred B. Weartherbee

57:17.912 --> 57:19.523
is now in session.

57:22.221 --> 57:25.877
[Milkins laughing mockingly]

57:28.749 --> 57:29.707
All rise.

57:32.884 --> 57:34.407
- Can't find my glasses, Frank.

57:36.365 --> 57:37.149
What?

57:38.367 --> 57:39.281
Use your words.

57:54.732 --> 57:55.733
- You may be seated.

57:58.300 --> 58:00.564
- Just remember everything
we talked about,

58:00.607 --> 58:01.913
and you'll do fine.

58:03.044 --> 58:05.220
- Miss King, is that you I see?

58:05.264 --> 58:10.269
- Ah, y-y-y-yes, Your
H-H-Honor. [chuckling nervously]

58:11.488 --> 58:12.227
- And who's that
you got with you?

58:12.271 --> 58:13.490
- Amanda, Your Honor.

58:13.533 --> 58:16.405
Uh, Amanda Hart, I mean.

58:16.449 --> 58:19.800
You approved our request for
me to act as lead counsel?

58:19.844 --> 58:21.236
- I did?

58:21.280 --> 58:22.890
- Yes, Your Honor,
three days ago.

58:24.065 --> 58:27.329
- Ah, [chuckling]
that's highly unusual.

58:27.373 --> 58:29.027
I don't seem to
have the paperwork.

58:32.944 --> 58:33.945
Must have left them.

58:34.815 --> 58:35.903
- [Bailiff] All rise.

58:37.252 --> 58:39.254
- I have a copy, Your
Honor, right here.

58:50.048 --> 58:50.831
- Hmm.

58:52.354 --> 58:55.009
I must have been in a
charitable mood that day.

58:55.053 --> 58:56.315
- Thank you, Your Honor.

58:58.056 --> 59:02.060
- [sighing] Alright, um,
oh, please be seated.

59:05.716 --> 59:07.805
Now, [sighing] since it appears

59:07.848 --> 59:09.937
that most of the
fifth grade class

59:09.981 --> 59:13.071
at Harris Hill Elementary
has decided to join us,

59:13.114 --> 59:14.768
I would like to remind everyone

59:14.812 --> 59:17.945
that even though this is
just a hearing not a trial,

59:17.989 --> 59:20.469
I expect complete
silence from the gallery

59:20.513 --> 59:21.688
during the proceedings.

59:23.037 --> 59:23.864
Understood?

59:26.737 --> 59:27.564
Good.

59:28.782 --> 59:32.133
Good, now, ah, we are here

59:32.177 --> 59:36.485
to determine whether the
fox captured on, ah, on...

59:37.835 --> 59:39.619
- November 9th, sir.

59:39.663 --> 59:40.489
- Yeah,

59:40.533 --> 59:42.143
on November 9.

59:42.187 --> 59:44.842
Ah, whether this
fox poses a danger

59:44.885 --> 59:48.497
to the community and
must be euthanized,

59:48.541 --> 59:51.239
or whether it can be
responsibly returned

59:51.283 --> 59:55.417
into said community.
[Milkins yawning]

59:55.461 --> 59:57.985
Any questions on
that before we begin?

59:58.943 --> 1:00:01.423
Any questions for counsel?

1:00:01.467 --> 1:00:02.468
- No, Your Honor.

1:00:04.513 --> 1:00:06.385
- No questions, Your Honor.

1:00:06.428 --> 1:00:08.387
- You may call
your first witness.

1:00:08.430 --> 1:00:10.476
- He was in very good
shape, considering.

1:00:10.519 --> 1:00:12.260
A clean bill of
health all and all.

1:00:12.304 --> 1:00:13.566
During the examination,

1:00:13.610 --> 1:00:15.437
he was perfectly
friendly and tame.

1:00:16.308 --> 1:00:18.571
- Your witness, Mr. Milkins.

1:00:18.615 --> 1:00:20.312
- Miss Jones, since the
fox has been at county,

1:00:20.355 --> 1:00:22.270
has anybody claimed
to be its owner?

1:00:22.314 --> 1:00:24.272
- Well, I only work
at the county shelter

1:00:24.316 --> 1:00:26.187
when they're short staffed, so--

1:00:26.231 --> 1:00:27.536
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, sure, sure,

1:00:27.580 --> 1:00:30.409
but has anybody claimed
the fox as their owner?

1:00:30.452 --> 1:00:31.802
- No.

1:00:31.845 --> 1:00:33.281
Not that I know of.

1:00:33.325 --> 1:00:36.023
- Okay, no further
questions, Your Honor.

1:00:36.067 --> 1:00:39.636
[Judge Weartherbee sighing]

1:00:42.595 --> 1:00:46.338
- We played the whole afternoon
with Max, I mean the fox,

1:00:46.381 --> 1:00:48.340
and he came up to
me really friendly.

1:00:48.383 --> 1:00:49.994
Like when I first met him.

1:00:50.037 --> 1:00:51.299
He's a sweetie pie.

1:00:53.214 --> 1:00:54.433
- Mr. Milkins?

1:00:54.476 --> 1:00:56.304
- Hmm, hmm, oh, yes.

1:00:57.741 --> 1:00:59.046
Uh, Miss, ah?

1:00:59.090 --> 1:01:00.657
- Margaret Cavanaugh.

1:01:00.700 --> 1:01:04.486
- Yeah, sure, um,
do you own the fox?

1:01:04.530 --> 1:01:05.400
- Me?

1:01:05.444 --> 1:01:06.663
No, I have a dog.

1:01:06.706 --> 1:01:10.362
- Hmm, and do you know
anyone who owns the fox?

1:01:10.405 --> 1:01:11.668
- Um, no.

1:01:11.711 --> 1:01:13.191
If I did, we wouldn't have spent

1:01:13.234 --> 1:01:15.193
all that time playing with him.

1:01:16.368 --> 1:01:18.544
- Yeah, no further
questions, Your Honor.

1:01:19.501 --> 1:01:21.155
- What's he doing?

1:01:21.199 --> 1:01:24.158
- He must think that if he
can show that no one owns Max,

1:01:24.202 --> 1:01:26.030
then Max should be put down.

1:01:26.073 --> 1:01:28.380
- Can't we say we own him?

1:01:28.423 --> 1:01:29.294
- No, Amanda.

1:01:29.337 --> 1:01:31.644
That wouldn't be the truth.

1:01:31.688 --> 1:01:32.863
I'm sorry.

1:01:32.906 --> 1:01:33.690
- I know.

1:01:34.691 --> 1:01:35.822
What do we do then?

1:01:35.866 --> 1:01:38.259
- We just keep going, and hope

1:01:38.303 --> 1:01:41.045
that our argument is
stronger than his in the end.

1:01:41.088 --> 1:01:42.046
You're doing great.

1:01:44.526 --> 1:01:46.528
- Your Honor, I'd like to call--

1:01:46.572 --> 1:01:49.706
- Brenda Killacky,
and yes, I'd heard

1:01:49.749 --> 1:01:51.403
that there was a fox roaming

1:01:51.446 --> 1:01:54.623
around the neighborhood,
so I called right away.

1:01:54.667 --> 1:01:57.975
Especially after poor
Fluffers went missing.

1:01:58.018 --> 1:02:00.412
- Fluffers is the cat that
you told Animal Control

1:02:00.455 --> 1:02:01.848
had been taken by the fox?

1:02:01.892 --> 1:02:04.982
- She's never been gone
for so long before.

1:02:05.025 --> 1:02:07.288
- Did you see the fox take her?

1:02:07.332 --> 1:02:08.376
- Well,

1:02:08.420 --> 1:02:09.682
no.

1:02:10.465 --> 1:02:11.249
Ooh.

1:02:12.685 --> 1:02:14.295
What a pretty

1:02:14.339 --> 1:02:15.775
kitty.
[cat meowing]

1:02:15.819 --> 1:02:18.386
- We found her at the
shelter two days ago.

1:02:18.430 --> 1:02:19.910
You have to say for the record,

1:02:19.953 --> 1:02:22.695
is this your cat
Fluffers, Mrs. Killacky?

1:02:22.739 --> 1:02:24.958
- Oh, I thought you
were giving him to me

1:02:25.002 --> 1:02:27.526
because I run the
rescue operation.

1:02:27.569 --> 1:02:28.527
- I,

1:02:28.570 --> 1:02:29.833
no, he's--

1:02:29.876 --> 1:02:32.618
- Oh, this isn't Fluffers.

1:02:32.661 --> 1:02:33.532
- But?

1:02:33.575 --> 1:02:34.576
- No,

1:02:34.620 --> 1:02:35.969
sorry.

1:02:36.013 --> 1:02:38.929
If the shelter's gonna put
him down, I'll take him.

1:02:38.972 --> 1:02:43.542
I'm a licensed rescue
organization for up to ten cats.

1:02:43.585 --> 1:02:47.938
And with Fluffers being gone,
well, I'm happy to take him.

1:02:48.982 --> 1:02:50.810
- No further
questions, Your Honor.

1:02:54.466 --> 1:02:55.902
- Do you own the fox?

1:02:55.946 --> 1:02:56.860
- No.

1:02:58.600 --> 1:02:59.601
Excuse me, Your Honor?

1:02:59.645 --> 1:03:01.125
What's going on here?

1:03:01.168 --> 1:03:02.909
- We're character witnesses.

1:03:02.953 --> 1:03:04.606
- Character witnesses?

1:03:04.650 --> 1:03:05.956
For a fox?

1:03:05.999 --> 1:03:06.870
- He's a nice fox.

1:03:06.913 --> 1:03:10.351
And you're a very mean man.

1:03:10.395 --> 1:03:12.266
We can raise our
hands and swear in,

1:03:12.310 --> 1:03:13.833
then repeat it if
you need us to.

1:03:13.877 --> 1:03:15.922
- No, that won't be necessary.

1:03:15.966 --> 1:03:17.968
Do any of you four own the fox?

1:03:18.011 --> 1:03:20.709
- No, it's Amanda's fox.

1:03:20.753 --> 1:03:22.929
- [chuckling] We'll
see about that.

1:03:25.497 --> 1:03:27.891
- Okay, this is the last witness

1:03:27.934 --> 1:03:30.154
before the judge deliberates.

1:03:30.197 --> 1:03:33.070
You're doing great, do you
remember our strategy with her?

1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:35.594
Almost there.

1:03:35.637 --> 1:03:36.595
Finish strong.

1:03:39.685 --> 1:03:42.688
- Mrs. Crabtree, I'd
like to get one question

1:03:42.731 --> 1:03:44.472
out of the way right
from the start.

1:03:44.516 --> 1:03:46.126
- Of course, dear, what is it?

1:03:46.170 --> 1:03:47.736
- Do you own the fox?

1:03:47.780 --> 1:03:49.695
[gallery laughing]

1:03:49.738 --> 1:03:51.610
- [chuckling] Heaven's no.

1:03:51.653 --> 1:03:54.047
- Last week, there
were 14 complaint calls

1:03:54.091 --> 1:03:56.963
to animal control
about Max, or the fox,

1:03:57.007 --> 1:03:58.660
and 12 of them were from you.

1:03:58.704 --> 1:04:00.880
- [chuckling] Well, I
don't know about that,

1:04:00.924 --> 1:04:02.447
I, I didn't count them,

1:04:02.490 --> 1:04:05.276
but, well I was really
worried about my bunnies.

1:04:05.319 --> 1:04:06.755
- I don't blame
you, Mrs. Crabtree.

1:04:06.799 --> 1:04:08.888
I mean, there was
a dangerous animal

1:04:08.932 --> 1:04:11.848
loose in the neighborhood,
wasn't there?

1:04:11.891 --> 1:04:13.284
After everything that happened,

1:04:13.327 --> 1:04:15.677
do you still think it was Max?

1:04:15.721 --> 1:04:17.157
- Well, right up until the time

1:04:17.201 --> 1:04:18.767
that that coyote attacked us,

1:04:18.811 --> 1:04:20.639
I would have said that
the fox was a menace,

1:04:20.682 --> 1:04:22.859
but after the way he saved us,

1:04:22.902 --> 1:04:26.123
no, no, I don't think your
fox is a danger to anyone.

1:04:26.166 --> 1:04:27.559
- Thank you, Mrs. Crabtree.

1:04:27.602 --> 1:04:28.777
No further questions.

1:04:34.174 --> 1:04:35.175
- Mr. Milkins?

1:04:36.742 --> 1:04:37.917
- No questions, Your Honor.

1:04:39.179 --> 1:04:40.789
- Very well.

1:04:40.833 --> 1:04:42.879
Does counsel have anything
to add before I deliberate?

1:04:42.922 --> 1:04:44.576
- Your Honor, I think I've shown

1:04:44.619 --> 1:04:45.925
that everything people
thought about Max,

1:04:45.969 --> 1:04:49.842
that he was a mean,
scary animal wasn't true.

1:04:49.886 --> 1:04:51.800
I know that there's
still the missing cats,

1:04:51.844 --> 1:04:54.020
but there's no proof
that he did that either.

1:04:54.064 --> 1:04:56.631
And we do know that there's
a coyote in the neighborhood

1:04:56.675 --> 1:05:00.026
that hurt other animals and
would have hurt humans, too.

1:05:00.070 --> 1:05:01.288
I'd also like to add,

1:05:01.332 --> 1:05:04.030
that it is legal to own
foxes in this state.

1:05:04.074 --> 1:05:07.512
They're not seen as dangerous
animals under the law.

1:05:07.555 --> 1:05:09.731
I promise that if
you let me take Max

1:05:09.775 --> 1:05:11.908
until I can find a
good home for him,

1:05:11.951 --> 1:05:14.823
nothing like this will
ever happen again.

1:05:14.867 --> 1:05:15.781
- Thank you, Miss Hart.

1:05:17.914 --> 1:05:19.045
Mr. Milkins?

1:05:19.089 --> 1:05:21.308
- Your Honor, it is
the county's opinion

1:05:21.352 --> 1:05:23.397
that his case is cut and dry.

1:05:23.441 --> 1:05:27.488
Foxes are classified as
wild animals, period.

1:05:27.532 --> 1:05:28.707
You know, whether
they're tame or not,

1:05:28.750 --> 1:05:29.795
they're still
highly unpredictable

1:05:29.838 --> 1:05:32.145
and potentially dangerous.

1:05:32.189 --> 1:05:34.931
Now, the state does allow
foxes to be kept as pets,

1:05:34.974 --> 1:05:37.803
but only under the
strictest of circumstances.

1:05:37.846 --> 1:05:40.632
However, that's not
what we have here.

1:05:40.675 --> 1:05:42.939
No one owns the
fox as we've shown.

1:05:42.982 --> 1:05:45.028
And the plaintiff
herself has admitted,

1:05:45.071 --> 1:05:47.160
that she was irresponsible
in taking care

1:05:47.204 --> 1:05:49.597
of the fox in the first place.

1:05:49.641 --> 1:05:51.773
So, the county has no reason

1:05:51.817 --> 1:05:53.819
to believe that
this will change.

1:05:53.862 --> 1:05:56.691
Therefore, we believe
the fox is a menace,

1:05:56.735 --> 1:05:59.085
and should not be allowed
back into the community.

1:06:00.826 --> 1:06:01.870
- Very well.

1:06:01.914 --> 1:06:03.481
We'll take a 15 minute recess

1:06:03.524 --> 1:06:05.265
while I make my final decision.

1:06:07.833 --> 1:06:09.966
You made a very fine
argument, young lady.

1:06:10.009 --> 1:06:11.924
You should be proud of that,

1:06:11.968 --> 1:06:14.579
but ah, I should also warn you,

1:06:14.622 --> 1:06:16.102
that I'm inclined
to rule in favor

1:06:16.146 --> 1:06:18.061
of the county at this point,

1:06:18.104 --> 1:06:21.020
but I will keep an open mind
as I review the testimony.

1:06:29.855 --> 1:06:32.684
[phone beeping]

1:06:37.036 --> 1:06:38.995
- Hey, Amanda?

1:06:39.038 --> 1:06:39.996
I am so proud of you.

1:06:40.039 --> 1:06:41.214
No matter what happens.

1:06:43.390 --> 1:06:45.566
- I'm sorry about
the fox, Amanda.

1:06:45.610 --> 1:06:48.265
I wish my rescue
license covered foxes.

1:06:48.308 --> 1:06:50.789
It wouldn't matter if
he was wild or not.

1:06:50.832 --> 1:06:54.923
If I was zoned for a wildlife
sanctuary, but I'm not.

1:06:56.273 --> 1:06:57.100
Sorry.

1:07:03.062 --> 1:07:05.891
- Sanctuary, I know
how to save Max.

1:07:05.934 --> 1:07:07.023
C'mon, I'll explain on the way.

1:07:07.066 --> 1:07:10.678
[upbeat orchestral music]

1:07:19.905 --> 1:07:21.211
- Will Miss Hart be joining us?

1:07:21.254 --> 1:07:23.126
- Y-y-y-y-yes,

1:07:23.169 --> 1:07:24.127
Your Honor I,

1:07:25.389 --> 1:07:26.172
I.

1:07:37.053 --> 1:07:39.403
- She'd like to ask for a
few more minutes, Your Honor.

1:07:39.446 --> 1:07:41.057
- C'mon, Your Honor.

1:07:41.100 --> 1:07:43.189
Why delay the inevitable?

1:07:43.233 --> 1:07:45.800
I'm trying to get nine holes
of golf in this evening.

1:07:45.844 --> 1:07:47.106
- I also have other appointments

1:07:47.150 --> 1:07:49.108
on my docket today, Miss King.

1:07:49.152 --> 1:07:50.414
You'll have to inform Miss Hart

1:07:50.457 --> 1:07:52.155
of my judgment when she arrives.

1:07:53.156 --> 1:07:54.853
Well,

1:07:54.896 --> 1:07:56.985
as much as I wish otherwise,

1:07:58.161 --> 1:08:00.337
I must regretfully
say that I find

1:08:00.380 --> 1:08:03.079
the county's argument
more compelling.

1:08:05.124 --> 1:08:08.867
Therefore, I ordered
the fox to be--

1:08:08.910 --> 1:08:10.086
- Your Honor, I have it.

1:08:11.826 --> 1:08:13.915
- What exactly do
you have, Miss Hart?

1:08:13.959 --> 1:08:15.439
- The license, they still had it

1:08:15.482 --> 1:08:19.007
at the clerk's office for
a wild animal sanctuary.

1:08:19.051 --> 1:08:21.967
A sanctuary named Max and Me.

1:08:22.010 --> 1:08:24.883
It was started by
my mom and my aunt.

1:08:24.926 --> 1:08:25.753
Thanks, Mom.

1:08:26.537 --> 1:08:28.147
They don't expire, Your Honor,

1:08:28.191 --> 1:08:31.846
and my aunt would like to
provide sanctuary for Max.

1:08:31.890 --> 1:08:34.066
- Well, this changes everything,

1:08:34.110 --> 1:08:35.285
now doesn't it, Miss Hart?

1:08:35.328 --> 1:08:36.808
- It does?

1:08:36.851 --> 1:08:38.375
- Yes, and I expect you to have

1:08:38.418 --> 1:08:40.507
a proper enclosure
within the week.

1:08:40.551 --> 1:08:41.987
- Not a problem, Your Honor.

1:08:42.030 --> 1:08:43.162
- Your Honor?

1:08:43.206 --> 1:08:44.946
- Mr. Milkins, be seated.

1:08:46.513 --> 1:08:49.995
Yes, yes, this does
change things, Miss Hart,

1:08:50.038 --> 1:08:54.173
and since no one has stepped
forward to claim, Max,

1:08:54.217 --> 1:08:55.696
I hereby order that--

1:08:55.740 --> 1:08:57.524
[Dimitri coughing]

1:08:57.568 --> 1:08:59.135
[Boris clearing throat]

1:08:59.178 --> 1:09:02.094
- Excuse me, please
to excuse, kind sir?

1:09:02.138 --> 1:09:03.182
- Now what?

1:09:03.226 --> 1:09:04.966
[Dimitri laughing]
- Hello.

1:09:06.838 --> 1:09:09.797
- Excuse a, please,
judge, your majesty.

1:09:09.841 --> 1:09:14.150
Ah, my brother and me, we
have been, how do you say?

1:09:14.193 --> 1:09:16.064
- Ah, Detaining.
- Ah, detaining.

1:09:16.108 --> 1:09:18.154
- No, no, detained.

1:09:18.197 --> 1:09:21.113
- We have just been able to
come here now, [laughing]

1:09:21.157 --> 1:09:24.203
but if it is this fox
you are talking about

1:09:24.247 --> 1:09:25.683
that's been running around town,

1:09:25.726 --> 1:09:26.771
well, ah,

1:09:26.814 --> 1:09:27.946
we,

1:09:27.989 --> 1:09:29.687
my brother and me,

1:09:29.730 --> 1:09:33.212
well, we, [chuckling]
we be owning this fox.

1:09:33.256 --> 1:09:36.476
- We'd like a chance
to question these men?

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:38.391
- Yes, yes, off course.

1:09:38.435 --> 1:09:40.567
- [laughing] Yes.
- [laughing] Yes.

1:09:47.139 --> 1:09:49.185
- Boo, huh,
[laughing] I kidding.

1:09:49.228 --> 1:09:52.362
- I have a certified
health certificate

1:09:52.405 --> 1:09:55.974
from animal doctor and
a receipt for be owning.

1:09:56.017 --> 1:09:57.932
- But if you really
owned the fox,

1:09:57.976 --> 1:10:00.979
then why did you say that
you were from animal control?

1:10:01.022 --> 1:10:03.068
- Because we were
controlling this animal,

1:10:03.111 --> 1:10:05.984
until the, well, until
my brother be losing it.

1:10:07.115 --> 1:10:10.467
We worry that, ah,
people will want reward

1:10:10.510 --> 1:10:11.337
for finding it

1:10:13.034 --> 1:10:15.994
if, ah, but we get no monies,

1:10:16.037 --> 1:10:19.258
until we be bringing
fox to new owner.

1:10:19.302 --> 1:10:23.219
So, we tell people he's
dangerous, this fox.

1:10:23.262 --> 1:10:24.611
- You're selling him?

1:10:24.655 --> 1:10:28.093
- Ah, yes, to fox
pen, north of here.

1:10:28.136 --> 1:10:30.356
- Fox pen? What's that?

1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:34.621
- It is, ah, it is place for
hunting with hound doggies.

1:10:34.665 --> 1:10:36.580
- No, Your Honor, you can't.

1:10:36.623 --> 1:10:37.363
[gavel banging on stand]

1:10:37.407 --> 1:10:39.104
- Order, order.

1:10:39.147 --> 1:10:40.758
Let me remind you,

1:10:40.801 --> 1:10:43.848
that hunting has a long and
proud tradition in this state.

1:10:43.891 --> 1:10:46.198
There's nothing illegal about
what they're doing here.

1:10:46.242 --> 1:10:47.286
- Yes, it's legal.

1:10:47.330 --> 1:10:49.419
We bring many foxes each year.

1:10:49.462 --> 1:10:51.247
- Wait, Max is from Russia?

1:10:52.509 --> 1:10:55.294
- Is that an electric
device in my courtroom?

1:10:55.338 --> 1:10:57.078
- If it pleases the
court, Your Honor,

1:10:57.122 --> 1:10:59.559
I'm Amanda's father
and a attorney.

1:10:59.603 --> 1:11:01.257
May I please
question the witness?

1:11:02.997 --> 1:11:04.477
- Why not?

1:11:04.521 --> 1:11:07.828
I've ignored every other law,
rule and regulation today.

1:11:07.872 --> 1:11:09.177
Have at it.

1:11:09.221 --> 1:11:12.616
- Sir, you say that you're
a citizen of Russia?

1:11:12.659 --> 1:11:17.273
- Yes, we are neighbors
from across the borders.

1:11:17.316 --> 1:11:20.014
- Then, where's your
International Broker's License

1:11:20.058 --> 1:11:22.669
from the Department
of Fish and Wildlife?

1:11:22.713 --> 1:11:24.062
- But, I don't know this thing.

1:11:24.105 --> 1:11:26.325
- Well, Your Honor, without

1:11:26.369 --> 1:11:28.327
an International
Animal's Brokers License,

1:11:28.371 --> 1:11:30.024
they're not allowed
to bring wild animals

1:11:30.068 --> 1:11:31.548
into the United States.

1:11:31.591 --> 1:11:34.333
Therefore, the fox must be
considered smuggled contraband,

1:11:34.377 --> 1:11:35.943
which means--

1:11:35.987 --> 1:11:38.685
- Which means they forfeit
their ownership rights.

1:11:38.729 --> 1:11:40.513
I hereby order the
fox be remanded

1:11:40.557 --> 1:11:43.777
into the custody of the
Max and Me Sanctuary.

1:11:43.821 --> 1:11:44.604
[gavel bangs against stand]

1:11:44.648 --> 1:11:46.258
[gallery cheering]

1:11:46.302 --> 1:11:48.260
- Yes.
- Where I hope

1:11:48.304 --> 1:11:50.654
he will live a long
and happy life.

1:11:50.697 --> 1:11:52.960

1:11:53.004 --> 1:11:56.834
[atmospheric orchestral music]

1:12:00.272 --> 1:12:01.317
- Do you know what today is?

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:03.231
It's my father's wedding.

1:12:03.275 --> 1:12:04.450
I'm gonna have a stepmom,

1:12:04.494 --> 1:12:08.498
and you're gonna have
an aunt. [chuckling]

1:12:08.541 --> 1:12:10.021
- Amanda,

1:12:10.064 --> 1:12:11.109
time to go.

1:12:11.152 --> 1:12:12.197
- Coming.

1:12:13.633 --> 1:12:15.287
- Amanda?

1:12:15.331 --> 1:12:16.810
- I'll be right there.

1:12:16.854 --> 1:12:19.204
- I swear, you'd miss
your own father's wedding

1:12:19.247 --> 1:12:21.337
just to spend a little
more time with Max.

1:12:24.209 --> 1:12:25.471
- Welcome home, Max.
