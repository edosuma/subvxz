05:07.813 --> 05:11.232
I have a package from
the nat-sat printing room.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.359
Say it a little louder.

05:13.569 --> 05:16.196
Open the window.
Shout it to Moscow.

05:16.405 --> 05:17.447
Sorry. I...

05:17.615 --> 05:20.283
It's not your fault you're stupid.

05:21.744 --> 05:24.787
- Open it and get out.
- It's chained to my wrist.

05:24.997 --> 05:26.789
Security has the key.

05:29.668 --> 05:33.963
Leave the material,
take the case, and wait outside.

05:34.548 --> 05:37.926
No can do, sir.
The material's locked inside.

05:38.093 --> 05:40.386
Just give it to me.

05:49.103 --> 05:50.395
Get in the closet.

06:10.124 --> 06:12.793
Hi-weather transmitted
this an hour ago.

06:13.002 --> 06:15.337
Beautiful close-ups!

06:15.505 --> 06:17.965
Miegs and Sline will drool.

06:18.132 --> 06:21.635
They're late again.
Unusual for soldiers.

06:21.803 --> 06:23.804
They know what they're doing.

06:28.017 --> 06:30.727
- Gentlemen.
- Here they are.

06:31.854 --> 06:35.774
- Are those from the latest fly-by?
Over here, general.

06:40.238 --> 06:43.532
Wait.
Is someone in this closet?

06:43.700 --> 06:46.577
- Ignore him.
- He's one of our couriers.

06:48.413 --> 06:49.830
Okay.

06:50.331 --> 06:54.459
Nice close-ups.
Definitely approaching full-go hour.

06:57.171 --> 07:00.882
I greased the House Committee
for covert appropriations.

07:01.092 --> 07:04.011
They think the funds are
for more stealth bombers.

07:05.096 --> 07:08.890
We've selected two GLG-20s.
They're the best men we have.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.101
The last two were the best men we had.

07:11.269 --> 07:13.854
Now they're the two best dead men
we have.

07:14.647 --> 07:17.858
I'm convinced there's a security leak
in your training program.

07:18.026 --> 07:22.613
- We could bypass training.
- No. They'll go through training.

07:22.822 --> 07:25.115
But with four other GLG-20s...

07:25.325 --> 07:28.702
...two who are responsible
for the project and two who are...

07:29.203 --> 07:30.871
...disposable.

07:31.039 --> 07:34.082
Are you suggesting we assign this job
to inferior personnel?

07:34.292 --> 07:37.461
No, I understand.
Two teams.

07:37.670 --> 07:41.882
One to do the job,
the other to be a diversion.

07:42.133 --> 07:45.843
- You mean decoys? Targets?
- Exactly.

07:46.053 --> 07:50.890
GLG-20s don't grow exactly on trees.
I'd hate to waste two as targets.

07:51.141 --> 07:54.894
I'm sure you can find a couple
of men you won't mind wasting.

08:51.952 --> 08:53.285
What?

08:58.625 --> 09:02.169
- What?
- Aren't you taking this test tomorrow?

09:02.796 --> 09:06.424
- The Foreign Service Board? Yeah.
- Don't you have to study?

09:07.175 --> 09:10.970
No. Are you kidding?
I know the FSB exam backwards.

09:11.179 --> 09:15.516
- I've taken it three times already.
- It's supposed to be all different this year.

09:15.726 --> 09:19.979
- Five hundred questions in two hours.
- Let me see the booklet.

09:23.483 --> 09:27.236
Look at these samples.
All multiple choice. It's easy.

09:29.573 --> 09:30.656
Here.

09:30.866 --> 09:35.453
"If discovered appropriating classified
documents at a foreign consulate reception...

09:35.662 --> 09:38.497
...you should
A, express concern.

09:38.707 --> 09:40.875
B, act surprised.

09:41.084 --> 09:42.668
C, deny everything...

09:42.836 --> 09:46.838
...and D, all three. "
The answer is D, all three.

09:47.256 --> 09:48.465
Common sense.

09:48.674 --> 09:51.301
I guess you don't want advancement
bad enough.

09:52.470 --> 09:55.847
My granddad was an envoy.
My dad was an envoy.

09:56.390 --> 09:58.725
I was born into the trade.

09:59.351 --> 10:03.438
Besides, I've arranged for an
intimate lunch with our supervisor.

10:04.315 --> 10:06.357
Fitz, you have to take the test.

10:06.567 --> 10:09.444
I'm very hurt that's why you invited me
over here today.

10:09.695 --> 10:12.113
Don't do that, Alice.

10:13.240 --> 10:17.118
I'm sorry, I'm not myself today.
I saw my neurologist this morning.

10:17.328 --> 10:20.497
You're not gonna give me
some bullshit that you're dying, are you?

10:21.540 --> 10:22.540
No...

10:23.375 --> 10:24.709
...not now.

11:10.923 --> 11:12.131
Millbarge.

11:15.928 --> 11:19.722
- Where's the brain for the Scramjam 7000?
- Procurement picked it up over an hour ago.

11:19.932 --> 11:20.932
Was it fixed?

11:21.100 --> 11:23.059
Yeah, new voice scramblers
and everything.

11:23.227 --> 11:26.396
Huh. What about that
Chinese radio chatter?

11:26.605 --> 11:27.605
It's done.

11:29.567 --> 11:32.026
- Here you go.
- Done?

11:34.154 --> 11:37.240
It was a static-filled, triple-scrambled
microwave transmission...

11:37.408 --> 11:39.784
...between two soldiers
talking in Mandarin Chinese.

11:39.952 --> 11:43.580
The Chinese were only using a simple
polyphonetically grouped 20-digit key...

11:43.747 --> 11:46.874
...transposed in boustrophendonic form
with multiple nulls.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.584
I broke it with this.

11:49.919 --> 11:51.628
A Drogan's decoder wheel?

11:51.796 --> 11:54.464
They put these in cereal boxes
for kids.

11:54.674 --> 11:58.343
Yeah, I found it in a box
of Lucky Charms.

11:58.970 --> 12:02.973
- Break it down again with the machines!
- I already did.

12:06.644 --> 12:09.104
Then clean up the desk!

12:15.194 --> 12:17.321
Good. That's much better.

12:17.989 --> 12:20.824
By the way, good luck
on the test tomorrow.

12:21.326 --> 12:25.370
- What test?
- Foreign Service Board exams. Good luck.

12:25.580 --> 12:28.832
Foreign Service Boards, tomorrow?
I can't take that test tomorrow.

12:29.042 --> 12:30.834
I haven't studied. I'm not prepared.

12:31.502 --> 12:33.754
You were bumped up on the list.

12:33.963 --> 12:38.425
You're scheduled for tomorrow
morning. I'm sure I told you.

12:39.385 --> 12:41.595
This is dated two weeks ago.

12:42.013 --> 12:43.889
You planned this.

12:44.098 --> 12:46.767
You want me to fail that test
so you can keep me...

12:46.935 --> 12:50.020
...down here in the center of the earth
doing your work for you.

12:50.229 --> 12:51.980
Watch your mouth, mister.

12:52.190 --> 12:55.734
This department's laying off
civilians left and right.

12:58.446 --> 13:02.366
- Where you going?
- Home. To study.

13:02.533 --> 13:07.037
Ha. One night studying for
a grade-19 FSB exam?

13:07.330 --> 13:09.831
- Good luck.
- Listen, captain.

13:10.041 --> 13:14.044
I'm going to pass that exam,
and I'm going to get out of this hole...

13:14.253 --> 13:17.547
...and do some really important work
for national security.

13:17.715 --> 13:19.216
Yeah, sure.

13:19.717 --> 13:23.679
I was going to do your family a favor
and hook up the Disney Channel...

13:23.888 --> 13:27.057
...for free. Well, forget it.

13:29.852 --> 13:30.894
Ladies and gentlemen...

13:31.062 --> 13:34.481
...as of this afternoon, the undersecretary
for South American affairs...

13:34.649 --> 13:36.942
...emphatically denies
any and all intervention...

13:37.151 --> 13:40.737
...in the current realignment of top positions
of the Paraguayan Air Force.

13:41.030 --> 13:42.447
Thank you very much.

13:42.657 --> 13:46.576
What about the Paraguayan army's request
for spraying subsidies?

13:47.912 --> 13:50.496
Are there any Paraguayans here?
No?

13:51.373 --> 13:56.002
Their request for subsidies
was not Paraguayan, as it were.

13:56.211 --> 13:59.964
The United States would never...
The president, our president, had not.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.925
As far as I know, that's how
it'll always be. Is that clear?

14:04.302 --> 14:06.762
How can you say we aren't
spending millions on spraying...

14:06.972 --> 14:09.432
...when the International
Wheat Board has reported...

14:09.599 --> 14:13.394
...and I quote, "Extensive contamination
in the Argentine grain fields"?

14:14.062 --> 14:16.397
The State... Ever...

14:16.857 --> 14:17.898
Microphones...

14:18.525 --> 14:21.110
...cutting out on us.
I'm sorry. However...

14:22.821 --> 14:24.739
Lunch date, so I must go.

14:28.535 --> 14:33.372
These examinations
are qualifiers for positions...

14:33.582 --> 14:37.001
...in the intelligence sections
of our embassies overseas.

14:38.754 --> 14:42.465
The nature of your postings
will be secret.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.927
Now, secret work can be very risky.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.972
I cite as an example what happened to
a great American...

14:50.182 --> 14:51.640
Not yet!

14:53.935 --> 14:55.853
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.563
My fault.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.155
Mm...

15:06.323 --> 15:09.283
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to attend the reading of a will.

15:10.827 --> 15:15.289
I had to stay to the very end.
I found out I received nothing.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.333
Broke my arm.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.842
Would you hold my wallet
while I take the test please?

15:27.010 --> 15:28.886
There's $1,000 in there...

15:29.805 --> 15:32.890
...or maybe there isn't.
Know what I mean?

15:33.183 --> 15:36.310
Are you saying I can take this money
if I help you pass the test?

15:37.687 --> 15:39.021
What do you think?

15:43.693 --> 15:44.777
Thank you.

15:46.363 --> 15:49.448
- Where do I...?
- Sit down!

16:07.633 --> 16:09.050
You may begin...

16:09.635 --> 16:10.635
...now.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.410
Excuse me.

18:36.739 --> 18:38.949
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.998
Oh, God, the pressure!
I can't take it!

18:48.960 --> 18:52.838
I can't take it! I can't!
I can't do it!

19:00.638 --> 19:03.140
I can't... What page?

19:05.226 --> 19:06.893
This is Emmett Fitz-Hume.

19:07.228 --> 19:10.022
He's an information
officer at State.

19:10.231 --> 19:12.649
He started there in '74 as a mail boy.

19:12.942 --> 19:14.860
His father got him his job.

19:16.070 --> 19:17.946
This is Austin Millbarge.

19:18.239 --> 19:22.659
He's a repair supervisor in DIA's
code-breaking arm at the Pentagon.

19:22.869 --> 19:26.747
Wiggled into supervisor's pay
through an F-section.

19:26.914 --> 19:30.667
His last job before joining Defense
was fixing office copiers.

19:31.794 --> 19:34.838
He's good with hardware,
got some Russian.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.465
Want to see their test scores?

19:36.674 --> 19:38.508
What the hell for?

19:38.718 --> 19:41.720
They're a couple of absolutely
self-involved bullshit artists...

19:41.929 --> 19:45.557
...who got caught cheating
on a departmental exam.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.893
They'll do anything
to save their jobs.

19:48.102 --> 19:50.437
One's got basic diplomacy skills.

19:50.646 --> 19:54.106
The other's a code-breaker
with language ability.

19:54.316 --> 19:56.400
I believe we've found our decoys.

20:00.572 --> 20:02.865
Uhn. Heart attack!

20:05.660 --> 20:07.578
Can I borrow your pen?

20:07.996 --> 20:09.872
All right, everybody,
please stand back!

20:10.040 --> 20:14.335
I'm a trained cardiovascular
respiratory emergency assist technician.

20:14.544 --> 20:19.465
Stand back! This man needs air!
All of you should leave the room...

20:20.634 --> 20:21.884
Well?

20:24.346 --> 20:26.931
So, what are we gonna get?
Dismissal? Suspension?

20:27.140 --> 20:29.809
Censure? Departmental prosecution?
What?

20:30.602 --> 20:31.602
Promotion.

20:31.812 --> 20:34.021
- What?
- That's right.

20:34.231 --> 20:36.941
We like what we've seen of you two.

20:37.150 --> 20:39.902
We're bucking you
right up to gathering.

20:40.112 --> 20:41.195
Level 20.

20:42.155 --> 20:46.158
Gathering, level 20?
That's quite a step up in base pay.

20:46.368 --> 20:47.535
We're not in trouble?

20:47.744 --> 20:50.037
We're not recruiting
for the Boy Scouts.

20:50.247 --> 20:52.540
We want people who are aggressive...

20:52.749 --> 20:57.169
...who know how to go after that
little edge that you need to survive.

20:58.213 --> 21:02.925
We especially liked the way you guys
were working as a team in there.

21:05.178 --> 21:10.182
Now, if you feel you can work together,
you're on your way up.

21:12.686 --> 21:15.438
We've got a very special assignment
for you two.

21:17.399 --> 21:19.525
- Foreign service?
- Yes.

21:19.693 --> 21:22.194
- Undercover work?
- Yes.

21:24.531 --> 21:27.366
- Emmett Fitz-Hume.
- Austin Millbarge.

21:27.534 --> 21:30.286
- When do we begin our training?
- Right away.

21:30.954 --> 21:32.121
Boy!

21:41.590 --> 21:44.049
We're just hitching a ride.
They won't make us jump.

21:44.259 --> 21:47.803
Jump? No chance.
We won't have to jump.

21:49.347 --> 21:52.933
All right, Sky-troopers!
Let's go! Let's go!

21:53.143 --> 21:55.393
Go?
What does he mean, go?

21:55.895 --> 22:00.565
Come on, come on. You can't do this!
What are you doing?

22:01.525 --> 22:02.567
Fitz-Hume!

22:15.664 --> 22:16.789
Help! Help!

22:50.991 --> 22:53.284
- Where are we?
- I don't know. I wasn't watching.

22:53.452 --> 22:55.537
I lost everything at 7,000 feet.

22:57.540 --> 23:01.459
- You hear that?
- Yeah. It's a dickfer.

23:01.669 --> 23:03.795
- What's a dickfer?
- To pee with.

23:08.926 --> 23:10.468
Was that me?

23:27.987 --> 23:31.489
- We need a plan.
- Let's play dead.

23:36.870 --> 23:41.207
- Come on, superspy, think of something.
- You're the diplomat. Talk to them.

23:47.172 --> 23:48.339
All right.

23:49.300 --> 23:52.677
Stop right there,
and I'll bring back the sun.

23:53.679 --> 23:55.179
Okay?

23:56.140 --> 23:59.057
This is my sister.
You can all have her.

23:59.267 --> 24:00.976
I hear she's very good.

24:01.269 --> 24:04.563
- One more step, I swing!
- He's threatening you!

24:04.772 --> 24:06.023
Let's get him!

24:06.232 --> 24:09.901
- Show some balls!
- It's too late to try to impress them.

24:12.155 --> 24:13.155
That's enough.

24:20.246 --> 24:22.789
- Austin Millbarge?
- Here, sir.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.167
Emmett Fitz-Hume.

24:26.085 --> 24:27.085
Hello.

24:30.465 --> 24:31.465
Sir.

24:33.718 --> 24:38.055
Colonel Rhombus, Special Projects
Training. We've been expecting you.

24:38.264 --> 24:41.683
Excuse me, but what was all this...?

24:41.893 --> 24:43.560
That's how I welcome new trainees.

24:43.895 --> 24:45.771
What's wrong with
coffee and a handshake?

24:45.980 --> 24:49.483
It's my job to get you prepared
to go out into the field for combat.

24:49.692 --> 24:52.778
I must know right away
what I've got to work with.

24:52.987 --> 24:54.488
I've made my decision.

24:55.782 --> 24:57.699
- What's it say?
- Pussy.

24:57.867 --> 25:01.244
I don't think that's fair. They had swords.
What are we supposed to do?

25:01.412 --> 25:05.248
It depends on your
particular arena of combat.

25:05.458 --> 25:06.792
Maybe this.

25:23.851 --> 25:25.977
I'll take you back to the base.

25:26.354 --> 25:28.855
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

25:29.023 --> 25:30.774
This is the obstacle course.

25:31.234 --> 25:34.319
It's the course familiar
to armed service recruits.

25:34.529 --> 25:37.030
Except that here in
Intelligence Operative Training...

25:37.198 --> 25:39.282
...we do it a bit differently.

25:39.492 --> 25:41.785
We add the element
of scorched earth.

25:51.254 --> 25:54.840
This is your standard
bog negotiation trial.

25:57.635 --> 26:00.761
You'll be judged
on survivability and time.

26:01.304 --> 26:02.638
Enter...

26:02.848 --> 26:04.181
...now!

26:12.149 --> 26:13.649
Heads down!

26:17.320 --> 26:21.574
This will verify your ability
to stay afloat at high speeds.

26:33.837 --> 26:36.922
We'll now begin with AFPSR...

26:37.132 --> 26:39.550
...air force passive strain response.

26:41.511 --> 26:44.054
You are not required
to exert yourself.

26:44.264 --> 26:48.559
Only to survive aggravated
body temperature measurement.

26:54.649 --> 26:56.358
Hot! Hot! Hot!

26:56.526 --> 27:00.946
We'll now determine your G-force
threshold. Relax, gentlemen.

27:02.532 --> 27:06.202
- I guess we just sit here?
- Piece of cake.

27:40.403 --> 27:42.863
- You want some coffee?
- Good idea.

27:49.079 --> 27:52.456
Colonel, we were just talking...

27:52.666 --> 27:55.709
We've had loads of fun here.
And, you know, we met new friends...

27:55.877 --> 27:57.628
...and had a great lunch, right?

27:57.796 --> 28:00.713
Yeah, the tuna-and-cream casserole
was beautiful.

28:00.965 --> 28:03.633
Anyway, we were just talking
and we'd like to go home now.

28:03.801 --> 28:06.970
So thanks for the bruises,
and you can keep the stool samples.

28:12.935 --> 28:16.604
Boys, it would be a shame
to have to kill you now.

28:19.108 --> 28:22.777
- What did he mean by that?
- Means we're OIO.

28:22.987 --> 28:24.028
What's that?

28:24.238 --> 28:26.823
Obligated involuntary officers.

28:28.158 --> 28:31.619
Gentlemen, begin
radical vertical impact simulation...

28:31.787 --> 28:33.288
...now.

28:46.886 --> 28:47.886
Come in.

28:53.225 --> 28:54.976
You wanted to see us, sir?

28:59.857 --> 29:00.857
Sit.

29:09.158 --> 29:10.491
Congratulations, men.

29:10.659 --> 29:14.078
You're about to enter the operational phase
of your assignment.

29:15.205 --> 29:18.082
I'm not authorized to give you
the full operational package...

29:18.250 --> 29:22.587
...but I will tell you the location of
your initial drop will be well inside Pakistan.

29:23.213 --> 29:24.672
- Pakistan?
- Pakistan?

30:36.619 --> 30:39.037
Is one of these people
our contact?

30:42.709 --> 30:46.920
Okay. Who led the American League
in home runs in 1953?

30:51.259 --> 30:52.843
I'll handle this.

31:24.417 --> 31:27.502
What's he doing?
- That's just their way of saying hello.

31:27.712 --> 31:30.881
Hello. I'm Austin.

31:35.553 --> 31:39.389
Hi. Bud Schnelker, liaison office.
U.S. Consulate, Karachi.

31:39.599 --> 31:43.477
Rob Hodges. DIA, West Asian section.
Welcome to Pakistan.

31:43.728 --> 31:47.022
Boy, you don't know
how glad we are to see you guys.

31:47.190 --> 31:50.650
- When's lunch?
- Come on, guys. Jeep's over here.

31:58.409 --> 32:00.660
I'm starving. What time you got?

32:06.958 --> 32:08.626
Hey, listen. Could we stop?

32:09.169 --> 32:12.004
- What's the matter?
- I gotta take a leak.

32:23.016 --> 32:24.642
You should go too.

32:25.685 --> 32:27.019
Are you my mother?

32:27.187 --> 32:30.773
Don't you think I'm capable of determining
my own time to go to the bathroom?

32:30.941 --> 32:33.275
Isn't now one of those times?

32:33.443 --> 32:34.735
No.

32:34.986 --> 32:38.614
You don't feel urgent pressure
on the inner wall of your bladder...

32:38.782 --> 32:42.743
...now, right at this moment?
- No. I'm fine.

32:43.578 --> 32:46.247
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable
being fully relieved...

32:46.414 --> 32:50.793
...of any excess fluids that might be
building up, immediately, right now?

32:50.961 --> 32:52.711
I got to take a whiz?

32:54.798 --> 32:57.883
- Don't go away.
- We'll be here.

33:03.890 --> 33:08.727
These guys are not our legitimate contacts.
These guys are KGB special branch.

33:09.271 --> 33:10.896
- Come on.
- Don't tell me to come on.

33:11.064 --> 33:12.481
That was a Russian wristwatch.

33:12.649 --> 33:14.859
I know the country of origin
of every timepiece.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.736
That was a Russian copy
of a 1969 Timex digital.

33:18.238 --> 33:20.072
Is this some kind of a hobby
with you?

33:20.240 --> 33:24.243
Most common slip-up in espionage.
We walked right into enemy hands.

33:27.873 --> 33:29.081
- Hi.
- Just between us...

33:29.249 --> 33:31.083
...if you know your final objective...

33:31.251 --> 33:34.920
...you'd be smart to tell us. We could
probably work things out quicker for you.

33:36.590 --> 33:39.175
Well, like he said, we still don't know.

33:39.342 --> 33:42.386
You know what they say
about this type of operation:

33:54.733 --> 33:56.108
- Feet.
- Hat.

34:03.825 --> 34:04.992
Come on!

34:11.623 --> 34:12.916
Look out!

34:19.130 --> 34:23.760
- They sure had me fooled.
- The Soviets obviously know we're here now.

34:24.136 --> 34:27.639
- Where to, boss?
- First we check our gasoline supply.

34:27.848 --> 34:31.309
- How's our gasoline supply?
- Eight 5-gallon cans.

34:31.560 --> 34:34.353
- That enough to get us to an airport?
- I hope so.

34:34.813 --> 34:38.149
We'll drive in shifts.
One drives, the other sleeps.

34:38.359 --> 34:40.318
I'll drive, you sleep.

34:41.946 --> 34:44.822
- Wake me up when you get tired.
- Okay.

34:44.989 --> 34:47.492
- Good night.
- Good night.

34:48.994 --> 34:51.621
- Sleep tight.
- Thanks.

34:51.830 --> 34:54.290
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.
- Okay.

34:55.333 --> 34:56.708
Night.

35:32.246 --> 35:35.999
Good morning. Is there
an airport near here?

36:04.945 --> 36:07.571
Austin. Your turn to drive.

36:14.537 --> 36:17.622
These are the Yusufzai.
They're Afghani freedom-fighters.

36:17.832 --> 36:19.166
They're our allies.

36:22.962 --> 36:24.588
We're Americans!

36:40.938 --> 36:42.147
Dr. Hadley!

36:48.071 --> 36:49.863
Oh, my God!

36:52.408 --> 36:54.117
What do you think you're doing?

36:58.498 --> 37:02.084
Sorry about this.
They're very distrustful of outsiders.

37:02.460 --> 37:05.879
- No problem.
- Get your men to cut them down.

37:17.058 --> 37:18.809
- Who are you?
- Oh, sorry.

37:18.976 --> 37:21.395
Hadley, London College of Medicine.

37:21.562 --> 37:24.523
They only allow us here
because we're helping with the wounded.

37:24.732 --> 37:27.401
- They didn't realize you were with the effort.
- With who?

37:27.568 --> 37:30.028
The United Nations medical effort,
of course.

37:30.238 --> 37:32.155
Aren't you
Drs. Trowbridge and Greenberg?

37:32.323 --> 37:33.949
Doctors?

37:34.117 --> 37:37.452
Yeah, sure. That's us. Uh-huh. We're
doctors. I'm Dr. Trowbridge. This is Dr...

37:37.620 --> 37:38.745
- Greenbaum.
- Berg.

37:38.913 --> 37:41.248
Greenbaumberg. We're doctors.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.501
Everybody looks fine here.
What do you say?

37:44.669 --> 37:46.503
I say yes, doctor.

37:49.340 --> 37:51.425
Stick your tongue out, please.

37:55.721 --> 37:56.888
Everything's fine.

37:59.225 --> 38:01.351
I guess we'll be heading back
to the old U.N.

38:01.519 --> 38:05.439
And of course we'll let them know
what a good job you're doing here.

38:07.108 --> 38:09.650
The American sense of humor.

38:09.985 --> 38:13.112
Come on. The others
are anxious to meet you.

38:15.824 --> 38:18.701
Have we received
the last shipment of penicillin yet?

38:18.869 --> 38:21.871
- Not yet, no.
- Possibly tomorrow.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.664
Two envoys are coming.

38:29.546 --> 38:33.215
Ah. Here we are.
I'm Hadley, Internal Medicine.

38:33.717 --> 38:36.302
Dr. La Fong, Communicable Diseases.

38:36.595 --> 38:39.138
Dr. Boyer, Bacteriology.

38:39.347 --> 38:43.893
Doctors Stinson, Marston, and Gill
of Northampton Trauma Institute.

38:44.102 --> 38:47.062
And Dr. Imhaus of
the Zurich relief fund.

38:48.106 --> 38:51.150
These are our newly arrived surgeons,
Trowbridge and Greenbaum.

38:51.359 --> 38:53.068
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

38:53.236 --> 38:54.445
Doctor.
- Doctor.

38:54.613 --> 38:58.365
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

38:58.533 --> 39:00.242
Doctor.
- Doctor.

39:00.410 --> 39:07.500
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

39:07.667 --> 39:08.667
Doctor.

39:08.835 --> 39:11.170
- And, doctor.
- Did we miss anyone?

39:11.338 --> 39:12.922
Why don't you gentlemen relax.

39:13.381 --> 39:16.759
The tribe's planning a raid on
a Soviet tank division tomorrow.

39:16.927 --> 39:18.719
There will be plenty for us
to do then.

39:19.513 --> 39:20.638
Doctors.

39:22.224 --> 39:33.943
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.236
Doctor.
- Doctor.

39:35.403 --> 39:36.445
Doctor.
- Doctor.

39:36.738 --> 39:38.489
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

39:40.784 --> 39:41.825
We're not doctors.

39:41.993 --> 39:45.120
We've got to get out of this place,
immediately, if not sooner.

39:45.288 --> 39:48.165
- Not until I've had...
- Excuse me.

39:49.543 --> 39:50.834
Her.

39:51.002 --> 39:55.214
- Am I interrupting?
- No! Not at all. He was just on his way out.

39:59.302 --> 40:02.221
What happens when
the real doctors come?

40:05.475 --> 40:08.018
- Dr. Trowbridge.
- Where?

40:08.186 --> 40:09.728
Oh! Right.

40:10.938 --> 40:14.232
- Make yourself comfortable. Sit down.
- Thank you.

40:28.038 --> 40:29.497
What can I do for you?

40:29.707 --> 40:32.375
Dr. Trowbridge...
May I call you Homer?

40:32.585 --> 40:35.003
- Why?
- That's your name.

40:35.421 --> 40:39.007
Oh! Right! Homer. Of course.
What's your name?

40:39.258 --> 40:41.676
- Karen.
- Karen.

40:42.761 --> 40:46.639
Dr. Trowbridge... Homer,
when you walked into this tent...

40:46.849 --> 40:49.892
...it was the most exciting
moment of my life.

40:50.936 --> 40:51.936
You just wait.

40:52.187 --> 40:55.106
You're a hero of mine.
I've read all your papers.

40:55.274 --> 40:56.566
How did you get my papers?

40:56.734 --> 40:58.276
Oh, you mean my medical papers.
Right.

40:59.737 --> 41:03.156
- Are you making fun of me?
- Oh, Karen. Our first fight.

41:03.365 --> 41:05.950
You might think I'm silly to worship you
the way I do...

41:06.118 --> 41:08.328
...but in my estimation, you're a genius.

41:09.371 --> 41:12.790
"Genius" is a pretty strong word,
but if you insist on using it...

41:12.958 --> 41:14.042
...I can handle it.

41:14.209 --> 41:17.337
In fact,
I hesitate to mention my problem.

41:17.546 --> 41:19.964
It's a task hardly worthy of your abilities.

41:20.382 --> 41:23.176
Go ahead and mention it.
There's nothing I wouldn't do.

41:23.344 --> 41:27.930
It's the khan's brother. He's been suffering
from pain in the right lower abdomen.

41:28.140 --> 41:31.351
- Obviously an inflamed appendix.
- Obviously.

41:31.560 --> 41:34.979
Dr. Hadley was going to remove it,
but now that you're here...

41:35.147 --> 41:38.566
I mean, just to see you perform
even the most simple surgery...

41:38.734 --> 41:41.194
...would be one of the great thrills
of my life.

41:41.403 --> 41:44.781
I'd rather not.
I don't have my instruments. Ahem.

41:45.032 --> 41:48.159
Use Dr. Hadley's. Please, Homer.

41:48.410 --> 41:52.080
The khan's brother is being prepped.
If you refuse to do this...

41:52.247 --> 41:55.208
...the khan will lose faith in you,
and us.

41:55.417 --> 41:57.919
The consequences could be severe.

41:59.963 --> 42:02.215
I see. Well...

42:02.758 --> 42:04.801
The truth is I am a great surgeon.

42:05.427 --> 42:09.430
But, alas, I recently suffered severe
nerve damage in my left hand.

42:09.640 --> 42:11.724
Oh, my God!

42:13.226 --> 42:16.269
Look at that.
No feeling at all.

42:16.604 --> 42:17.854
Dead.

42:18.064 --> 42:21.900
- How did that happen?
- I was lifting a car off a child.

42:22.110 --> 42:23.944
It was a big car, a Cadillac.

42:25.029 --> 42:30.075
I'm so disappointed.
And the khan, he'll be very suspicious.

42:31.244 --> 42:34.621
- My God.
- Oh, there, there.

42:35.331 --> 42:38.125
Actually, I could
operate without my hands.

42:38.292 --> 42:39.751
Dr. Greenbaum could be my hands.

42:39.919 --> 42:42.254
I could tell him what to do,
and he'd do it for me.

42:42.422 --> 42:46.591
- Then you'd get a chance see me in action.
- That would be wonderful.

42:47.635 --> 42:52.305
Of course, after I guide Dr. Greenbaum
through an operation, I get very depressed...

42:52.473 --> 42:55.100
...because I couldn't do it myself.

42:55.768 --> 42:57.436
It's a very bad time for me.

42:57.854 --> 43:00.981
Don't you worry. I'll be with you.

43:05.153 --> 43:06.611
Give me a break.

43:10.658 --> 43:12.409
About an hour?

43:12.660 --> 43:14.119
Fine. An hour.

43:16.372 --> 43:17.497
Thank you.

43:17.665 --> 43:20.000
- Bye.
- Bye.

43:23.463 --> 43:26.089
You're good with tools, aren't you?
Devices, instruments?

43:26.257 --> 43:28.675
What? You kidding? You're talking
to Millbarge here.

43:28.843 --> 43:31.386
You want something converted,
built, repaired, modified.

43:31.554 --> 43:32.971
You're talking to Mr. Hands.

43:36.434 --> 43:39.060
Ah. Oh. Mind if I play through?

43:42.231 --> 43:46.026
Doctor. Doctor. Ha. Glad I'm not sick.

43:55.578 --> 43:58.538
If anything happens to him,
my people will be angry.

43:59.248 --> 44:04.211
To die in battle is glorious.
To die in a tent is disgrace.

44:04.879 --> 44:07.506
And with that,
I give you Dr. Julius Greenbaum.

44:08.466 --> 44:09.883
Thank you, doctor.

44:10.051 --> 44:12.219
I'll just step out for a smoke.

44:12.386 --> 44:13.887
Perhaps I'll stay here. Heh-heh.

44:14.304 --> 44:16.722
Today we will be removing
the patient's appendix.

44:16.932 --> 44:20.518
The first step in an operation
of this particular type is...

44:34.699 --> 44:36.534
...to shave the patient.

44:42.499 --> 44:44.416
Ah. Forget it, get on with it.

44:46.586 --> 44:50.297
We'll skip the shave
and go to the operation.

44:50.507 --> 44:54.510
The second step
in an operation of this type is...

45:00.517 --> 45:02.560
...anesthetic.

45:04.855 --> 45:08.816
But can't you tell? He's already been given
the required injection of Pentothal.

45:08.984 --> 45:10.025
Of course.

45:10.193 --> 45:14.572
He's already been given
the required injections.

45:14.990 --> 45:17.908
All right.
Let us begin the operation.

45:38.263 --> 45:39.805
Thank you, doctor.

45:41.391 --> 45:43.517
And now, the first incision.

45:52.444 --> 45:53.485
Doctor.

45:53.695 --> 45:57.114
Isn't that incision a bit high
for an appendix?

45:57.324 --> 46:01.410
Do you wanna do the operation?
Fine. You come on up here, and you do it.

46:01.870 --> 46:04.371
- Imhaus.
- He was cutting into his chest!

46:04.539 --> 46:07.082
Did you see me cut into his chest?
Did I cut his chest?

46:07.250 --> 46:10.336
I was probing to determine muscle tone
and skeletal girth.

46:10.503 --> 46:12.046
It's a new technique.

46:12.213 --> 46:15.716
- We mock what we don't understand.
- Yeah.

46:17.343 --> 46:19.677
Go ahead, will you? I'm getting hungry.

46:21.680 --> 46:24.182
And now, the first incision.

46:47.456 --> 46:50.541
And now, I will incise.

46:57.216 --> 46:58.883
Cut the sucker.

47:14.566 --> 47:17.193
This man is dead.

47:52.312 --> 47:53.563
Excuse us.

47:54.106 --> 47:55.273
Thank you.

49:02.131 --> 49:03.423
Let me do it!

49:25.780 --> 49:27.489
Emmett!

49:27.824 --> 49:29.699
Help me!

49:35.123 --> 49:36.331
Let go!

50:28.300 --> 50:30.259
The drive-in is closed.

50:31.219 --> 50:33.387
We're with the Ace Tomato Company.

50:49.863 --> 50:53.532
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.
The military love it.

50:53.783 --> 50:56.619
Christ, will you look at this place?

51:13.803 --> 51:16.180
- Mr. Ruby.
- Sir.

51:16.348 --> 51:17.473
Mr. Keyes.

51:17.641 --> 51:21.644
- Yes, sir.
- Won't you gentlemen have a Pepsi?

51:44.292 --> 51:46.502
Two Pepsis to go.

51:54.886 --> 51:56.011
Now what?

51:56.221 --> 52:01.016
"Why don't you gentlemen
have a Pepsi?"

52:14.823 --> 52:16.282
You do it.

52:45.477 --> 52:46.686
This way, gentlemen.

52:53.402 --> 52:55.153
Welcome to W.A.M.P.

53:03.579 --> 53:06.372
- General Sline, sir.
- Yes, sergeant?

53:06.540 --> 53:09.334
It's a collect call from Pakistan
for Mr. Ruby.

53:09.543 --> 53:12.045
A Mr. Fitz-Hume.

53:12.254 --> 53:13.254
What?

53:13.422 --> 53:17.717
Folks, sorry. We'll just be another minute.
Thank you for your patience.

53:17.885 --> 53:19.510
It's person to person, sir,
collect.

53:19.678 --> 53:22.680
Their contacts tried to kill them
and they don't know what to do.

53:22.848 --> 53:26.392
And they told you this
over a public phone?

53:26.560 --> 53:29.354
No, sir, the AT&T operator
told our operator.

53:30.731 --> 53:33.483
- They're insane.
- And apparently roaming free.

53:33.650 --> 53:34.984
He's on line seven, sir.

53:35.152 --> 53:36.778
Get us the hell out of here!

53:36.945 --> 53:39.614
Everything's under control,
Mr. Fitz-Hume.

53:40.074 --> 53:41.574
Hold on one moment.

53:41.825 --> 53:44.118
Look, the longer we keep them
out in the field...

53:44.286 --> 53:47.622
...the more heat we can draw
away from the real team.

53:48.457 --> 53:51.584
I agree. Let's send them over the border.

53:52.586 --> 53:55.671
- How do they get there?
- That's their problem.

53:55.881 --> 53:57.548
Hello, gentlemen.

53:58.467 --> 54:01.344
Listen, we are organizing
a rescue operation for you.

54:01.595 --> 54:04.472
For after you've reached
your final objective.

54:04.640 --> 54:06.307
What is our final objective?

54:06.475 --> 54:09.394
Information like that is given out
on a need-to-know basis only.

54:09.603 --> 54:12.688
And at this particular time,
you do not need to know.

54:12.898 --> 54:16.109
However, we can tell you
to make immediately...

54:16.318 --> 54:18.820
...for the Soviet Pamir District.

54:20.114 --> 54:23.990
Wait for your next contact
on the road to Dushanbe.

54:28.496 --> 54:30.080
The road to Dushanbe?

54:30.248 --> 54:32.582
You practically told them the strike zone.

54:32.750 --> 54:34.751
Listen.
Even if they make it there at all...

54:34.919 --> 54:37.671
...they'll be plucked
by Soviet motorized infantry.

54:37.839 --> 54:41.341
The road to Dushanbe is
a heavily traveled military artery.

54:42.135 --> 54:44.302
I guess that takes care of that.

54:45.513 --> 54:48.014
We must make no mistakes this time.

54:49.225 --> 54:52.894
Our whole way of life
hangs in the balance, gentlemen.

54:59.986 --> 55:01.361
Pamir? Dushanbe?

55:01.529 --> 55:04.364
- You're sure that's what he said?
- Right.

55:04.824 --> 55:08.243
- Those places are in Russia?
- And how.

55:12.665 --> 55:14.708
No, thanks.
I've already eaten.

55:14.876 --> 55:17.377
How can we get there?
It must be 1000 miles from here.

55:17.545 --> 55:20.589
Actually, if this is
the lower Kohistan district...

55:20.756 --> 55:23.758
...we're only about 150 miles
from the Soviet border.

55:23.968 --> 55:25.802
You would have to know that.

55:27.054 --> 55:31.224
Wait a minute. The Soviet border?
How do we get across the Soviet border?

55:31.601 --> 55:34.394
We don't shave, sell the ambulance...

55:34.562 --> 55:37.731
...sell our clothes, and go native.

55:51.245 --> 55:53.246
How far do we have to go on this bus?

55:53.414 --> 55:55.582
As far as it takes us.

56:06.260 --> 56:08.386
Hey, look! It's Dr. Boyer!

56:15.770 --> 56:18.480
She's the last person we want to see.

56:18.898 --> 56:21.024
No, she's nice.

56:59.479 --> 57:02.147
- Is this the border?
- No. Toll stop.

57:02.315 --> 57:05.734
Hopefully, there won't be
any guard posts where we're gonna cross.

57:08.697 --> 57:11.615
Look. Dr. Boyer.

57:13.660 --> 57:15.494
Leave it alone.

57:24.504 --> 57:27.006
I left without saying goodbye.
Can you ever forgive me?

57:31.094 --> 57:32.386
Where are you going?

57:32.554 --> 57:34.555
You can't deny
what happened between us.

57:34.723 --> 57:36.473
Don't touch me.

57:36.641 --> 57:37.850
Come on.

57:44.983 --> 57:46.567
"Don't touch me. "

57:59.539 --> 58:02.374
Look at this. This is really neat. Ha-ha.

58:05.712 --> 58:09.423
How do you like that? She lets a little thing
like death interfere with romance.

58:09.591 --> 58:14.136
They couldn't have done any better with
the khan's brother. They aren't doctors.

58:14.304 --> 58:15.346
What do you mean?

58:15.513 --> 58:18.182
That metal case
she was packing on her horse.

58:18.350 --> 58:20.559
- What about it?
- It's a Satscrambler terminal.

58:20.727 --> 58:22.936
Sophisticated system
for sending, scrambling...

58:23.104 --> 58:25.397
...receiving and unscrambling
satellite messages.

58:25.565 --> 58:27.899
So she's a sophisticated woman.

58:28.108 --> 58:31.069
It's a highly classified piece
of intelligence hardware.

58:31.236 --> 58:35.907
- So she's a high-class intelligent piece.
- Come on, knock it off.

58:36.450 --> 58:39.744
Well, what are you saying?
That they're spies like us?

58:39.953 --> 58:43.081
They're spies,
but not necessarily on our side.

58:45.084 --> 58:47.669
I think it's our duty
as American operatives...

58:47.878 --> 58:50.922
...to follow her and find out
what she's up to.

58:51.090 --> 58:53.383
- You just want to follow her.
- No.

58:53.592 --> 58:56.052
You're thinking with your dick.

58:56.220 --> 58:57.679
They left their Land Rover here.

58:57.846 --> 59:00.932
They're probably headed right
for the border at some secret point.

59:01.100 --> 59:03.142
It would save us a lot of trouble.

59:03.310 --> 59:06.521
They do seem to be headed
in that general direction.

59:06.689 --> 59:10.024
- Maybe your dick's not so dumb.
- Got me through high school.

59:25.290 --> 59:28.209
Do you think those men
are following us?

59:31.004 --> 59:34.465
They're most likely Chitrali nomads.
Not to worry.

59:52.818 --> 59:55.987
- Did you say sit?
- I didn't say sit.

59:56.488 --> 59:59.782
- Did you say sit?
- No, I didn't say sit. What...?

01:00:06.123 --> 01:00:07.165
Now what?

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.168
I guess we walk.

01:00:39.238 --> 01:00:41.031
Why do we have to carry
all this stuff?

01:00:41.199 --> 01:00:44.785
The Dushanbe road runs across the top
of the mountains, the roof of the world.

01:00:44.952 --> 01:00:48.371
It'll be sub-arctic temperatures
up there, freezing. You'll thank me.

01:00:48.998 --> 01:00:50.540
"You'll thank me. "

01:01:22.114 --> 01:01:23.156
That's it.

01:01:23.616 --> 01:01:25.242
The Dushanbe road...

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.162
...where we're supposed to meet
our contacts. I hope.

01:01:35.962 --> 01:01:40.298
Only insofar as it serves to confirm
the president's own beliefs.

01:01:40.508 --> 01:01:43.301
This is quite an exciting project
you've got here, general.

01:01:43.511 --> 01:01:45.679
What was the cost
of this Star Wars system?

01:01:45.847 --> 01:01:47.931
- Just under 60 billion.
- Quite a bargain.

01:01:48.099 --> 01:01:50.934
Sir. Printout from Gravsat.

01:01:52.103 --> 01:01:55.939
Let's see. A transmission from the field,
your GLG-20s.

01:01:57.441 --> 01:01:59.734
Well, wonderful.
They confirm estimated arrival...

01:01:59.944 --> 01:02:02.779
...at the strike site by 6 p. m.
Their time tomorrow.

01:02:02.947 --> 01:02:06.074
That's 9 a. m. Here.
Right on schedule.

01:02:06.242 --> 01:02:09.369
You can always count on our people.

01:02:17.795 --> 01:02:19.254
Well, this is it.

01:02:20.464 --> 01:02:22.799
Where are those contacts
we heard so much about?

01:02:22.967 --> 01:02:25.218
Didn't exactly say where on the road,
did they?

01:02:25.386 --> 01:02:26.803
No.

01:02:27.471 --> 01:02:29.847
Maybe we should start hitchhiking.

01:02:30.056 --> 01:02:32.641
We're inside the Soviet Union.

01:02:33.768 --> 01:02:38.522
- I wish we hadn't lost Boyer.
- They were on horseback. We were on foot!

01:02:55.248 --> 01:02:57.166
It's the Tadzhik highway patrol.

01:02:58.919 --> 01:03:03.297
They were just sitting there in the dark.
They heard our entire conversation.

01:03:05.425 --> 01:03:06.842
What are they saying?

01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:10.346
He says we needn't
bother whispering anymore.

01:03:10.847 --> 01:03:12.681
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:03:12.891 --> 01:03:16.310
- We try that, they'll cut us down.
- We can't just go with them.

01:03:16.519 --> 01:03:18.395
What other choice do we have?

01:03:18.563 --> 01:03:21.941
If we give ourselves up, the state
department can work out an exchange...

01:03:22.108 --> 01:03:23.359
...to get us home.
- Not me!

01:03:30.492 --> 01:03:32.201
Hi! Just me.

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.019
I was just looking for
the Burt Reynolds Theater.

01:04:03.441 --> 01:04:05.693
Don't I get a phone call?

01:04:14.661 --> 01:04:16.453
Who do you intend to call?

01:04:23.086 --> 01:04:26.088
Goddamn it.
He gives himself up.

01:04:30.677 --> 01:04:33.344
- What's your objective?
- My objective?

01:04:33.554 --> 01:04:37.932
I object to taking a girl out and buying her
dinner and then she won't put out for you.

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:46.774
- Why are you here?
- Why am I here? Why are you here?

01:04:46.942 --> 01:04:50.069
Why is anybody here?
I think it was Jean-Paul Sartre who said...

01:04:50.237 --> 01:04:52.155
How do you spell Sartre? Ow!

01:04:52.614 --> 01:04:54.157
And let that be a lesson to you!

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:56.617
Every minute you don't tell us
why you're here...

01:04:56.785 --> 01:04:58.703
...I cut off a finger.

01:04:58.871 --> 01:05:01.330
- Mine or yours?
- Yours.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:02.582
Damn!

01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:06.335
Oh! Why are you still hitting me?
He's gonna cut my fingers off.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:09.922
- You have 30 seconds.
- You're not gonna hum the Jeopardy theme?

01:05:10.132 --> 01:05:13.509
We start with the little one.

01:05:13.677 --> 01:05:16.304
All right. All right.
I'm an American agent.

01:05:16.638 --> 01:05:17.638
And...?

01:05:17.806 --> 01:05:19.474
And...

01:05:19.641 --> 01:05:23.352
They sent me here to
assassinate your premier.

01:05:23.562 --> 01:05:27.940
- I knew it! Pay up.
- Let's cut his fingers off anyway.

01:05:28.108 --> 01:05:29.817
No.

01:05:29.985 --> 01:05:33.029
Let's take him back to headquarters
in Moscow.

01:05:33.197 --> 01:05:36.407
Good move. Good move. Headquarters.

01:05:40.245 --> 01:05:42.705
It shouldn't be much further now.
We've made good time.

01:05:42.873 --> 01:05:45.666
We'll go on foot from here.

01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:28.042
Goddamn it!

01:06:45.726 --> 01:06:47.477
Hi.

01:06:47.645 --> 01:06:50.230
How you doing?
Remember me?

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:53.650
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:57.028
They surprised us.
Border troops.

01:06:57.238 --> 01:06:58.613
They got my partner.

01:06:58.823 --> 01:07:01.408
- Did they get you too?
- I'm fine!

01:07:01.576 --> 01:07:06.413
No wonder neither of you could do that
appendix operation. You're spies like us!

01:07:06.581 --> 01:07:10.333
- You mean you're...?
- Austin Millbarge. I'm a GLG-20.

01:07:10.501 --> 01:07:12.544
So...

01:07:12.712 --> 01:07:16.423
...you two are the other GLG-20s.
The decoys!

01:07:16.632 --> 01:07:18.884
- Decoys?!
- Lower your voice.

01:07:19.093 --> 01:07:23.388
That's why they rushed us through training,
why we were met by the KGB...

01:07:23.598 --> 01:07:26.558
...why they sent us into enemy hands.
- Right.

01:07:26.767 --> 01:07:31.396
I am extremely pissed off.
My partner and I were set up.

01:07:31.606 --> 01:07:35.942
Forget it, that's behind us.
Our first priority is to cover those bodies...

01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:40.322
...establish a new base camp
and complete this project.

01:07:40.531 --> 01:07:45.744
Project? Fitz-Hume is in the custody of
the Tadzhik highway patrol because of you.

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:52.584
The only project I have to complete
is to get my partner out.

01:08:10.102 --> 01:08:13.772
Fitz-Hume! Fitz-Hume!

01:08:26.118 --> 01:08:27.160
Come on!

01:08:38.921 --> 01:08:43.341
- Look at this. Did you do that?
- Yeah, I did that for you.

01:09:09.786 --> 01:09:14.790
You know, I must really like you because
I don't like horses and I hate guns.

01:09:34.935 --> 01:09:37.520
- What's this?
- You don't want it!

01:09:49.743 --> 01:09:50.743
Duck!

01:10:05.759 --> 01:10:07.468
I'll get the horse.

01:10:19.314 --> 01:10:20.564
Let's go!

01:10:23.318 --> 01:10:25.402
Hi-yo, Silver! Away!

01:11:02.815 --> 01:11:06.651
It's "Soul Finger" by the Bar-kays.

01:11:07.528 --> 01:11:10.113
They must be having trouble getting gigs.

01:11:28.549 --> 01:11:31.634
This is a Soviet ICBM site.

01:11:37.182 --> 01:11:41.894
That's an SS-50 long-range
rocket and mobile launcher.

01:11:46.525 --> 01:11:49.819
They just moved it in here.
Haven't even put up their locator beacon.

01:11:49.987 --> 01:11:53.906
Means they're not hooked in to
Soviet defense. They are radio-isolated.

01:11:54.116 --> 01:11:55.324
Only three men.

01:11:57.494 --> 01:11:58.494
And their mother.

01:12:16.138 --> 01:12:17.138
Let me see that.

01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:18.890
Come on!

01:12:30.068 --> 01:12:32.820
Honestly.
You two are unbelievable.

01:12:33.739 --> 01:12:38.075
- Wait a minute. What are we doing here?
- This is our final objective.

01:12:38.285 --> 01:12:42.287
Our project orders are to subdue the crew
and seize control of this emplacement.

01:12:42.455 --> 01:12:46.166
Hold it, sister. We're not going near
that thing. That missile is tipped with...

01:12:46.334 --> 01:12:48.960
...a 40-megaton nuclear warhead.
- Good night, everybody.

01:12:49.128 --> 01:12:50.921
- Where are you going?
- Home.

01:12:51.130 --> 01:12:55.258
For once, I am in complete agreement.
We should all get up and leave immediately.

01:12:55.426 --> 01:12:57.052
You know what those things can do?

01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:00.055
Suck the paint off your house
and give your family an orange Afro.

01:13:00.223 --> 01:13:04.434
I don't care what you two do,
but I'm fulfilling my obligation.

01:13:04.602 --> 01:13:08.813
I intend to go down there and seize control
of that emplacement alone if I have to.

01:13:08.981 --> 01:13:10.106
Now, wait a minute.

01:13:10.274 --> 01:13:13.527
You know we'd do anything for you,
but we can't go seize that rocket.

01:13:13.694 --> 01:13:17.322
- We'd have to kill everybody down there.
- And I'm not killing anybody.

01:13:17.657 --> 01:13:19.199
I'm not either.

01:13:26.374 --> 01:13:30.335
Gentlemen, I think you both should realize
the gravity of this moment.

01:13:30.545 --> 01:13:35.465
I've spent the last two and a half years
of my life preparing for this penetration.

01:13:35.675 --> 01:13:38.635
This afternoon I buried
my partner, Jerry Hadley...

01:13:38.803 --> 01:13:43.557
...perhaps the finest, most dedicated
GLG-20 in the history of the service.

01:13:43.766 --> 01:13:46.476
He is now forever entombed
in a snowy grave.

01:13:46.644 --> 01:13:48.562
And it's not going to be for nothing!

01:13:49.772 --> 01:13:54.818
We are here today to guarantee
the personal freedom of every American.

01:13:55.027 --> 01:13:59.948
And we should never forget the words of
President John F. Kennedy, who said:

01:14:00.116 --> 01:14:02.826
"Ask not what your country can
do for you...

01:14:03.035 --> 01:14:06.288
...but what you can do for
your country. "

01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:10.208
Will you marry me?

01:14:18.384 --> 01:14:19.593
Now...

01:14:20.678 --> 01:14:24.139
These are high-compression
tranquilizer pistols.

01:14:24.307 --> 01:14:26.766
We're not going to kill anybody...

01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:30.854
...but you've got to get in close
to use them.

01:14:43.366 --> 01:14:46.619
Hours, T-minus two until designated
target apogee.

01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:54.168
Sir, all air traffic has been
diverted from our response corridor.

01:14:54.377 --> 01:14:57.838
What's our present on-line power
reading?

01:14:58.256 --> 01:15:01.592
Michigan reactor and Washington State
atomic plants on-line, general.

01:15:03.887 --> 01:15:05.304
Lock us in, sergeant.

01:15:13.563 --> 01:15:14.897
W.A.M.P. Secure, sir.

01:15:16.524 --> 01:15:20.235
All right. Let's go to
response level yellow.

01:15:20.528 --> 01:15:22.905
Initiating level yellow.

01:15:52.394 --> 01:15:54.603
Run your full servo and arming.

01:16:32.142 --> 01:16:34.560
Servo on and armed.

01:17:02.087 --> 01:17:03.713
"Soul Finger. "

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.928
"Soul Finger. "

01:17:49.927 --> 01:17:51.511
What's she saying?

01:17:52.221 --> 01:17:54.597
Hair... Hairbrush... Headrest.

01:17:55.057 --> 01:17:57.266
Jesus, where'd you learn
your Russian, J.C. Penney?

01:18:05.108 --> 01:18:08.402
When she was a child in Lithuania,
her uncle used to tell a story...

01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:12.824
...about strange beings that came down
from a disk and stole an ox...

01:18:13.033 --> 01:18:16.494
...which the village had put aside
for roasting.

01:18:16.703 --> 01:18:20.122
I told you it would work.
Everybody knows about UFOs.

01:18:20.332 --> 01:18:23.793
Apparently the aliens from the silver disk
dissected the ox...

01:18:23.961 --> 01:18:26.504
...and kept the best pieces of meat
for themselves.

01:18:26.713 --> 01:18:28.965
So what?
So we owe them a cow.

01:18:30.342 --> 01:18:32.677
Where do we get one?

01:19:05.334 --> 01:19:06.626
Do what I do.

01:19:39.744 --> 01:19:42.412
Satscram signal from the strike site.

01:19:42.622 --> 01:19:46.082
Your GLG-20s have penetrated successfully
and are awaiting the go-code.

01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:49.169
Open and lock down ground deflectors.

01:20:25.665 --> 01:20:27.832
Ground deflectors opened and locked.

01:20:42.056 --> 01:20:45.808
- Okay, Dostoyevsky, what does it say?
- It says:

01:20:46.017 --> 01:20:48.018
"Approach SS-50...

01:20:48.228 --> 01:20:51.772
...source programmable rocket. "

01:20:59.572 --> 01:21:00.823
Easy.

01:21:01.032 --> 01:21:05.703
"Find control box at front
of transporter. "

01:21:08.999 --> 01:21:10.499
This is a snap.

01:21:10.917 --> 01:21:14.628
"For erector panel, push red button. "

01:21:27.392 --> 01:21:29.309
"Depress red key switch.

01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:33.272
- Enter first numbered sequence. "
- Go.

01:21:33.606 --> 01:21:34.940
"Three-three-nine...

01:21:36.276 --> 01:21:38.277
...dash two-five-nine...

01:21:39.237 --> 01:21:40.320
...dash six.

01:21:42.741 --> 01:21:45.451
Acknowledge compliance
on Satscram now. "

01:21:45.618 --> 01:21:48.746
GLG-20s acknowledge
programming and compliance.

01:21:48.955 --> 01:21:51.457
Bring all birds
into final bounce mode.

01:22:54.019 --> 01:22:55.853
Bounce mode engaged.

01:22:57.397 --> 01:22:59.524
Send them the go-code.

01:23:13.413 --> 01:23:16.374
"Go with numbered sequence,
seven-four...

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:19.544
...dash seven-four...

01:23:19.795 --> 01:23:21.879
...dash eight-eight-three...

01:23:22.047 --> 01:23:24.173
...dash five, dash three. "

01:24:28.947 --> 01:24:32.200
SAC-COM confirms an outbound blip
from Soviet Central Asia.

01:24:33.118 --> 01:24:34.202
It's on its way.

01:24:34.411 --> 01:24:37.914
Override all SAC alerts
with stand-down orders for 10 minutes.

01:24:39.458 --> 01:24:41.375
SAC override code, entered.

01:24:41.627 --> 01:24:43.461
Error. Stand down.

01:25:15.284 --> 01:25:17.327
I think we just started World War Ill.

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.125
She wants to know why
we would do such a thing.

01:25:27.296 --> 01:25:28.713
Tell her so do we.

01:25:42.311 --> 01:25:45.021
- What are they saying?
- It's 4:47 a. m.

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:49.109
They're saying it'll be 28 minutes before
the rocket detonates above its target...

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:51.695
...somewhere inside
the continental United States.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.911
Let's see, 28 minutes. That's 18 until
it's inside the U.S. Radar cup.

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:04.541
Figure two for our response,
say 20 until total commitment.

01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:09.212
Figure 20, 22 until the first impact
of our retaliatory strike.

01:26:09.422 --> 01:26:13.758
I figure we have 42 minutes until
the end of civilization as we know it.

01:26:18.097 --> 01:26:21.683
- You want to go out with a bang?
- I beg your pardon?

01:26:22.893 --> 01:26:24.102
Just an idea.

01:26:24.353 --> 01:26:28.106
You know, if we were sitting in a bar,
I'd throw a drink right in your face.

01:26:32.737 --> 01:26:34.946
But under the circumstances...

01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:36.990
...it's not such a bad idea.

01:28:17.924 --> 01:28:19.591
Release full pulse.

01:28:20.218 --> 01:28:21.218
Three...

01:28:22.262 --> 01:28:23.762
...two...

01:28:24.431 --> 01:28:25.431
...one.

01:28:25.682 --> 01:28:26.682
Mark.

01:28:37.735 --> 01:28:40.779
Bounce pulse failed to connect
with target, sir.

01:28:41.448 --> 01:28:44.199
- Just what are you saying, soldier?
- We missed it, sir.

01:28:44.367 --> 01:28:46.702
- What?
- We missed the rocket. It didn't work.

01:28:48.746 --> 01:28:51.540
Didn't work?
Where did the pulse go?

01:28:51.749 --> 01:28:54.709
Don't know, sir,
but it definitely didn't connect.

01:29:04.386 --> 01:29:06.679
- Wow.
- Excellent!

01:29:11.018 --> 01:29:13.728
- We'd better call the president.
- We're not calling anyone.

01:29:13.896 --> 01:29:15.897
What do you mean,
we're not calling anyone?

01:29:16.064 --> 01:29:19.775
The president must know that this attack
was not initiated by the Soviet Union.

01:29:23.906 --> 01:29:26.574
We are prepared for this contingency.

01:29:27.242 --> 01:29:29.035
What in hell do you intend to do?

01:29:29.203 --> 01:29:30.745
You understand, sir...

01:29:30.913 --> 01:29:34.707
...that we are responsible for launching
a nuclear weapon against our own country!

01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:38.419
No one outside this command center
has that information, gentlemen.

01:29:38.879 --> 01:29:41.756
When we commissioned
the Schmectel Corporation to research...

01:29:41.924 --> 01:29:45.176
...this precise event-sequence scenario,
it was determined...

01:29:45.344 --> 01:29:48.971
...that the continual stockpiling
and development of our nuclear arsenal...

01:29:49.181 --> 01:29:54.435
...was becoming self-defeating.
A weapon unused is a useless weapon.

01:29:54.895 --> 01:29:57.813
SAC-COM confirms.
All defense systems commitment ready.

01:29:58.023 --> 01:30:02.109
We have verification. The president
is aboard the airborne command center now.

01:30:03.487 --> 01:30:08.616
I'm sure it will only be a matter of minutes
before the president commits to total release.

01:30:11.537 --> 01:30:13.704
Jesus Christ.

01:30:18.627 --> 01:30:23.923
You see, we had to show that we had
the technical capability...

01:30:24.508 --> 01:30:26.008
...and were determined.

01:30:27.636 --> 01:30:32.640
History demonstrates conclusively
that naive wishing for peace...

01:30:33.141 --> 01:30:37.353
...is the surest possible way
to encourage an aggressor.

01:30:37.521 --> 01:30:40.231
I demand you place me in communication
with the president!

01:30:40.399 --> 01:30:43.818
Relax, Mr. Ruby. This facility
is more than adequately stocked...

01:30:44.027 --> 01:30:46.946
...for a comfortable 17 months
of below-ground existence.

01:30:47.155 --> 01:30:48.364
We'll be fine.

01:30:48.615 --> 01:30:51.993
By your actions, sir, you are risking
the future of the human race!

01:30:53.495 --> 01:30:56.580
To guarantee the American
way of life...

01:30:57.415 --> 01:31:00.208
...I'm willing to take that risk.

01:31:10.845 --> 01:31:14.347
Hard to believe it's been only
15 minutes since I destroyed the world.

01:31:15.349 --> 01:31:18.059
In another 15 minutes, it'll all be over.

01:31:18.436 --> 01:31:21.187
Such a short time to destroy a world.

01:31:21.647 --> 01:31:25.859
And to think my high school guidance
counselor said I'd never amount to anything.

01:31:26.068 --> 01:31:27.569
It just goes to show...

01:31:27.778 --> 01:31:30.655
Guidance?
Source Programmable guidance!

01:31:31.115 --> 01:31:34.618
Fitz-Hume! Boyer!
Get up! Get up!

01:31:39.665 --> 01:31:42.292
Come on! Come on!

01:31:43.628 --> 01:31:46.588
Fitz-Hume! Boyer!

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:55.847
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

01:31:56.098 --> 01:31:58.725
- You have a tent?
- Bring me the Satscram dish.

01:31:58.934 --> 01:32:00.226
I think we can recall it.

01:32:00.394 --> 01:32:02.896
What do you mean?
You mean like a defective Pinto?

01:32:05.941 --> 01:32:08.902
Take this up. Up. Climb!

01:32:10.946 --> 01:32:13.782
Grab a rock! Grab a hammer!
We can divert it!

01:32:13.949 --> 01:32:17.452
It's made to respond to in-flight commands
through their sat-relay network.

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:20.580
- Here's a rock.
- Go to the Satscram terminal.

01:32:22.625 --> 01:32:24.501
- Now what?
- Smash that thing.

01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:31.758
- It's broken.
- Bring it here.

01:32:31.967 --> 01:32:33.218
Not the rock.

01:32:36.931 --> 01:32:39.015
What's the use?
It's probably all over anyway.

01:32:39.183 --> 01:32:42.602
No, no, no. All we have to do
is switch sending boards.

01:32:45.773 --> 01:32:49.567
Boyer, start sending the launch sequence
in reverse order.

01:32:49.985 --> 01:32:50.985
Yes, sir.

01:32:58.159 --> 01:33:01.745
Fitz-Hume, hold these together.

01:33:02.247 --> 01:33:05.124
I've got to make the splice.
Hold it together.

01:33:05.667 --> 01:33:07.960
- Ow! I got a shock.
- And you will.

01:33:08.128 --> 01:33:11.130
I don't care how painful it is,
you've got to hold them together.

01:33:11.297 --> 01:33:12.965
You are the circuit bridge.

01:33:13.216 --> 01:33:15.843
- But, but, but...
- I need...

01:33:16.511 --> 01:33:17.636
Bigger than a bread box?

01:33:17.804 --> 01:33:20.973
- I need...
- The title of a movie?

01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:27.479
Animals in their natural habitats?
Book title? Things that are round?

01:33:27.647 --> 01:33:30.274
Things that are square.
Things that are being electrocuted?

01:33:30.442 --> 01:33:32.359
Got it!

01:33:41.828 --> 01:33:44.830
Miles: Five...

01:33:45.039 --> 01:33:46.039
...zero...

01:33:46.833 --> 01:33:47.875
...zero...

01:33:56.509 --> 01:33:58.385
- We did it!
- We did?

01:33:59.012 --> 01:34:00.053
We did it!

01:34:02.724 --> 01:34:04.641
Can I borrow your tent?

01:34:05.643 --> 01:34:09.229
SAC-COM confirms destruction
of the inbound at Zulu 3000 hours.

01:34:09.397 --> 01:34:12.316
- What about the rest of their inbounds?
There are none, sir.

01:34:12.525 --> 01:34:15.903
Both the U.S. And Soviet
response chain on full recall.

01:34:16.821 --> 01:34:19.782
Damn. Recall.

01:34:44.057 --> 01:34:47.017
- Place them under arrest. All of them.
- Wait!

01:34:47.227 --> 01:34:49.812
- We don't know these men.
- Oh! We were kidnapped!

01:34:50.021 --> 01:34:52.439
- That's right! Kidnapped!
We were!

01:34:52.649 --> 01:34:54.191
We were at the drive-in!

01:34:54.609 --> 01:34:59.028
As the disarmament talks
continue through closed sessions...

01:34:59.196 --> 01:35:02.865
...last night and on into this afternoon,
a feeling of positive anticipation...

01:35:03.075 --> 01:35:05.117
...is shared by everyone
in the press corps.

01:35:07.579 --> 01:35:09.664
The doors to the conference room
are opening.

01:35:09.873 --> 01:35:13.835
I see the chief United States delegate,
Mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume.

01:35:14.628 --> 01:35:16.712
Mr. Fitz-Hume.
- Hi, Ed.

01:35:16.922 --> 01:35:21.843
Everybody at home is most anxious to know
how things are going in there.

01:35:22.052 --> 01:35:24.929
Well, Ed, right now we're at
an extremely sensitive juncture.

01:35:25.097 --> 01:35:28.641
And of course, the slightest misperceived
phrase or gesture...

01:35:28.851 --> 01:35:31.185
...could upset everything
we've achieved today.

01:35:31.395 --> 01:35:34.564
- Now, if you'll excuse me, Ed.
- Thank you, Mr. Fitz-Hume.

01:35:34.773 --> 01:35:35.940
Thank you, Ed.

01:35:36.108 --> 01:35:39.110
Mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume,
chief state department negotiator...

01:35:39.278 --> 01:35:42.613
...here at the disarmament talks,
re-entering what he has called...

01:35:42.781 --> 01:35:45.116
...the "delicately balanced negotiations. "

01:35:48.579 --> 01:35:50.329
Comrade!

01:35:53.292 --> 01:35:54.750
Okay.

01:35:55.043 --> 01:36:00.298
"What Little Richard song
was the title of a 1950s movie...

01:36:00.757 --> 01:36:03.551
...starring Jayne Mansfield?"

01:36:12.227 --> 01:36:14.520
"Good Golly Miss Molly"?

01:36:16.815 --> 01:36:18.149
"Great Balls of Fire"?

01:36:18.358 --> 01:36:20.818
Wrong! It was
"The Girl Can't Help It. "

01:36:22.321 --> 01:36:24.280
- Sorry. You lose.
- Eastern Europe.

01:36:24.489 --> 01:36:25.990
Eastern Europe.

01:36:26.305 --> 01:36:32.572
