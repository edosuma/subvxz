10:23.710 --> 10:25.233
Yeah, I did.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.626
After he hit her.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.540
We have a complaint from
a witness on the scene

10:28.584 --> 10:30.978
that says that you menaced
Gillette with your weapon

10:31.021 --> 10:32.327
for no reason.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.026
IAB will be looking into it.

10:36.070 --> 10:39.987
IAB? Are... are you serious?

10:40.030 --> 10:41.641
You're being modified pending

10:41.684 --> 10:43.294
the outcome
of the investigation.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.731
But, boss, I...

10:44.774 --> 10:46.602
Your gun and shield.

11:04.707 --> 11:07.579
I was sitting in the back seat
of our car,

11:07.623 --> 11:10.670
an old Vista Cruiser
parked here,

11:10.713 --> 11:12.541
waiting for my dad
to drive me to the beach.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.674
Down the block,
in front of that church,

11:14.717 --> 11:17.589
I saw two people arguing.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.156
Did you recognize
either of them?

11:19.200 --> 11:21.768
Reggie Lewis
and Sandra Harris.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.335
She cleaned houses and he
worked in the barber shop.

11:24.379 --> 11:27.077
What were they arguing about?I couldn't really hear.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.688
But she was upset.

11:28.731 --> 11:29.776
I saw her

11:29.819 --> 11:31.255
pull a gun from her bag,

11:31.299 --> 11:32.779
and she just aimed it at him

11:32.822 --> 11:35.564
and shot him in the chest.

11:36.739 --> 11:40.047
Did either of them see you?She never looked
around. She just

11:40.090 --> 11:42.136
shot him and then
she turned around

11:42.179 --> 11:43.050
and ran away.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.747
How come you never came forward?

11:44.791 --> 11:47.402
Word was Reggie
had ties to a gang.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.056
I was 13.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.493
My parents were scared.
I was scared.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.495
Mostly, they didn't
trust the cops.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.062
What ever happened
to Sandra Harris?

11:55.105 --> 11:57.064
She moved out
two weeks after the murder

11:57.107 --> 11:58.805
and no one ever
heard from her again.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.545
Did the cops look into Harris
for the murder?

12:00.589 --> 12:01.808
She was questioned.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.374
There wasn't much
of an investigation.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.333
For a murder in broad daylight?

12:05.376 --> 12:08.423
1993.
A Black man killed in Harlem?

12:08.466 --> 12:10.294
It didn't even make the paper.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.819
Well, the gun was recovered.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.865
There are prints on it,
but there was never a match.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.867
Yeah, but if we can
locate Sandra Harris,

12:17.911 --> 12:20.957
we could, uh,
see if there is a match.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.916
Why, all of a sudden,
with all the cases we have,

12:22.959 --> 12:25.309
did you decide
to reopen this one?

12:25.353 --> 12:27.790
I thought you would want to.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.619
I-I thought it would
help bring closure.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.275
A lot of times
closure's overrated.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.413
[door opens, shuts]

12:42.457 --> 12:43.980
You modified Witten?

12:44.024 --> 12:45.286
So?So, she didn't

12:45.329 --> 12:46.635
do anything wrong.Then I'm sure IAB

12:46.678 --> 12:48.071
will clear her.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.290
She gets assaulted,
and then she's placed

12:49.333 --> 12:50.465
on modified assignment.

12:50.508 --> 12:51.901
How's that make sense?Very simple.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.642
She menaced a citizen.

12:53.685 --> 12:54.643
A citizen that assaulted her.

12:54.686 --> 12:55.600
She has no physical injury

12:55.644 --> 12:57.124
and she pulled a gun.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.604
You get hit from behind,
you pull your weapon

12:59.648 --> 13:01.432
because you got no idea
what's coming next.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.739
And now there's a video
of a cop holding a gun

13:03.783 --> 13:06.829
on a bunch
of unarmed bystanders.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.309
We cannot have that.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.963
We can't modify officers
without cause.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.879
Excuse me, did you get promoted
and I don't know about it?

13:12.922 --> 13:14.097
Because the last time I looked,

13:14.141 --> 13:15.359
you were a sergeant
and I was a captain.

13:15.403 --> 13:16.491
Yeah, then act like one.

13:16.534 --> 13:17.709
You should be
standing up for your cops.

13:17.753 --> 13:18.841
You have five seconds to
get the hell out

13:18.885 --> 13:20.974
of my office, Sergeant.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.894
Can you think of anyone
who might have wanted

13:27.937 --> 13:29.286
to hurt you or your wife--

13:29.330 --> 13:31.114
some form of retaliation
or something?

13:31.158 --> 13:32.072
No.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.638
I noticed you
have no tattoos,

13:33.682 --> 13:35.118
so I'm assuming
no gang affiliation.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.641
Wait, my son's on a ventilator

13:36.685 --> 13:37.947
and you're asking me
if I'm in a gang?

13:37.991 --> 13:40.297
There's a lot of gang activity
in that area.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.342
I got to bring it up.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.344
Look, man,
I'm not in a gang, okay?

13:43.387 --> 13:44.824
Okay.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.826
Can you think of anyone
you may have had words with?

13:46.869 --> 13:48.349
I mean, I got into
a little back and forth

13:48.392 --> 13:50.046
with a guy before the party,
but that was nothing.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.179
What was it about?He told me to
turn off the music

13:52.222 --> 13:53.702
and I told him to go to hell.

13:53.745 --> 13:54.877
Do you know who this guy was?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.357
I heard his girlfriend
call him Larry

13:56.400 --> 13:59.229
when she pulled him away.Do you know where he lives?

13:59.273 --> 14:02.624
Hon.I got to go.

14:24.341 --> 14:25.168
Hi.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.779
You didn't have to come by.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.088
You gonna invite me in?

14:32.132 --> 14:33.916
Yeah.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.571
I just wanted to come by
and make sure

14:36.614 --> 14:38.051
that you weren't...

...you know,

14:40.140 --> 14:43.491
maxing out
on junk food and...

But thank God.
I feel so much better now.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.104
I'm fine, Eddie.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.932
I'm not fine.
None of this is fine.

You didn't do anything wrong.

And yet...

Once this investigation is over,

14:55.982 --> 14:57.113
you'll be cleared.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.549
Then everything will
go back to normal?

Eh.People will stop

14:59.899 --> 15:01.639
looking at us
like we're the enemy?

15:01.683 --> 15:04.381
I was at the gym yesterday
and there was a guy there

15:04.425 --> 15:08.037
wearing a shirt that said,
"Blue Lives Murder."Hey, it's just one guy.

15:08.081 --> 15:12.128
I was reading one of those
cheesy magazines

15:12.172 --> 15:14.565
with all the quizzes, and...

15:14.609 --> 15:17.525
you meet your 18-year-old self,
and you only have three words.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.875
What do you say?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.095
You know, the first thing
I thought of...

15:22.138 --> 15:23.313
What?

15:23.357 --> 15:25.881
"No police department."

15:25.925 --> 15:28.144
What are you saying,
that you don't want to

15:28.188 --> 15:29.711
be one anymore?
Come on.

15:29.754 --> 15:32.627
I don't know. Maybe.

15:32.670 --> 15:35.673
Witten, it was just routine.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.110
Someone calls and complains,

15:37.153 --> 15:38.981
the department has to
go through the motions.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.157
They took my gun and shield.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.985
That doesn't feel like
going through the motions.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.726
That feels like
a public humiliation.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.684
I'm sorry.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.512
Stop.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.862
I want to make sure
that you know that

15:50.906 --> 15:52.864
I'm here for you
no matter what.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.431
With the last name Reagan.

15:54.475 --> 15:57.217
Ooh, I hope you're not
talking about the commissioner,

15:57.260 --> 16:00.481
who singlehandedly
reinstated you.

16:00.524 --> 16:03.049
Come on, he has
your back. So do I.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.660
Look, I'm... I'm really fine.

16:07.357 --> 16:11.709
I'll call you tomorrow.
I promise.

16:11.753 --> 16:14.103
Okay.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.978
Um, hey, I just...

16:19.021 --> 16:20.240
I thought that they asked you

to turn in all of your guns.

It was my dad's,

16:29.379 --> 16:31.164
from when he was
on the job.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.122
I'm sentimental about it.

16:33.166 --> 16:37.170
I know this is hard for you.

And I'm here if you need me.

Well, no one is better

Are you ready to go home
or are you sleeping here?

It's late.

Some days don't end
by the clock.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.055
Okay.

17:46.326 --> 17:49.242
Any update on that
mother's boy in the hospital?

17:49.285 --> 17:52.419
Eli Chesnick had surgery
to remove the bullet.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.508
He's in ICU,
but it's touch-and-go.

17:54.551 --> 17:57.815
Looks like we found
our guy in the bus shooting.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.382
His car plate
was altered,

17:59.426 --> 18:00.949
but we were able
to locate him

18:00.992 --> 18:03.734
using a bumper sticker
and an anonymous tip.

18:03.778 --> 18:06.650
Who's the guy?One Kenny Kilmer.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.088
42, lives in
Dyker Heights.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.524
His social media
is full of rants

18:10.567 --> 18:12.091
against just about everyone.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.789
He been arrested five times
for aggravated harassment

18:14.832 --> 18:17.400
and assault, but gets
released every time.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.142
And he's been in and out of
mental hospitals his whole life.

18:21.970 --> 18:25.843
And why do I think that's not
what you stayed late to tell me?

18:29.804 --> 18:31.675
The mayor has scheduled
a press conference

18:31.719 --> 18:35.114
for tomorrow morning to announce
the shooter's arrest.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.570
I don't know.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.879
Hey.

19:01.923 --> 19:05.056
You ever go visit
the Statue of Liberty?

19:05.100 --> 19:07.624
Yeah. Once.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.670
I always loved that
she was a woman,

19:09.713 --> 19:12.151
especially growing up
in a house full of boys.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.457
She looks kind of pissed off,
you ask me.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.677
Well, I can relate to that, too.

19:16.720 --> 19:21.203
Why does Crawford think
I'm trying to sabotage her

19:21.247 --> 19:22.596
by opening up this case?

19:22.639 --> 19:26.513
It's simple. She's a D.A.
and you're a Reagan.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.471
It's a murder.
It should be solved.

19:28.515 --> 19:30.821
Yeah, well, there's a lot
of cases need to be solved.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.214
Why this one?

19:32.258 --> 19:36.044
I guess I was trying
to find some common ground,

19:36.087 --> 19:37.785
some insight into her.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.526
Yeah, and what if
the insight you get,

19:39.569 --> 19:41.005
uh, makes you
wish you hadn't?

19:41.049 --> 19:43.573
What is that supposed to mean?Look, Sandra Harris

19:43.617 --> 19:45.488
was a person of interest
in the murder,

19:45.532 --> 19:47.011
but was never charged.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.317
And there were rumblings

19:48.361 --> 19:50.754
that it was an abusive
relationship.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.234
She have an alibi?

19:52.278 --> 19:53.931
She said she was
home at the time.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.933
Her daughter backed her up.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.108
She has a daughter?

19:57.152 --> 19:58.893
Leticia.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.851
And?

20:00.895 --> 20:04.246
And guess who was
best friends with Leticia.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.900
Your friend, the D.A.

20:05.943 --> 20:08.642
Yeah, that's right.

20:12.994 --> 20:17.955
I got a Larry Wilson
residing at 450 East 121st.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.088

20:20.131 --> 20:21.524
Great. Flag it.Probably just

20:21.568 --> 20:23.396
another dead end.Yeah.

20:23.439 --> 20:26.094
Speaking of dead ends,

20:26.137 --> 20:27.922
I actually paid a visit

20:27.965 --> 20:31.099
to Maggie Gibson yesterday.
You know, the medium?

20:31.142 --> 20:33.797
Because you were
looking for help

20:33.841 --> 20:36.496
or looking for an
excuse to see her?

20:36.539 --> 20:38.498
I was going to see her for help.

20:38.541 --> 20:41.370
She's been very helpful
in the past, right?

20:41.414 --> 20:44.330
We're running into dead ends,
and she's been right

20:44.373 --> 20:46.810
on our cases on more
than one occasion.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.160
I get it.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.466
Maybe she'll come up
with something.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.294
I got a Larry Knoll.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.035
Lives across
from the playground.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.993
He's got a prior for assault.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.430
Really?

20:57.473 --> 20:59.910
Well, let's pay this
Larry Knoll a visit.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.351
Footage from inside
and outside the deli.

21:05.394 --> 21:08.832
You'll see when you watch it
that it exonerates Witten.

21:08.876 --> 21:10.312
Where'd you get this?

21:10.356 --> 21:11.835
The owner of the deli
called me up, gave it to me.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.315
You should have
referred it to IAB

21:13.359 --> 21:14.838
instead of playing
detective.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.971
I'm not playing anything.You think because

21:17.014 --> 21:19.626
your name is Reagan
that you can bigfoot me.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.236
That's not what
I'm doing here, boss.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.324
It's disrespectful.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.326
No disrespect intended.

21:24.370 --> 21:27.068
I even catch you
whispering about this case,

21:27.111 --> 21:28.417
I'm gonna write you up.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.289
Good to know you have my back
as well as Witten's.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.334
Noted, Sergeant Reagan.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.249
Oh, by the way,
I need you to address

21:34.293 --> 21:35.816
a precinct condition.

21:35.859 --> 21:40.168
Set up a DWI checkpoint
from 2200 hours to 0600 hours.

21:40.211 --> 21:43.084
DWI. You want me to stand around
babysitting a bunch of rookies?

21:43.127 --> 21:44.520
Are you refusing the assignment?

21:44.564 --> 21:46.783
No.

21:46.827 --> 21:48.611
Dismissed.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.964
Excuse me, sir.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.879
Detective Reagan.
My partner, Detective Baez.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.751
We're looking for a Larry Knoll.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.100
That's me.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.362
Would you mind putting
that down, please, sir?

22:02.843 --> 22:04.192
What's this about?

22:04.235 --> 22:05.454
It's about an altercation

22:05.498 --> 22:07.500
you had yesterday
with a Marcus Carter.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.632
I don't even know who that is.He's the guy

22:09.676 --> 22:11.417
you told to shut off his music.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.461
The guy you threatened.

22:12.505 --> 22:13.984
I didn't
threaten anybody.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.421
That's not what we heard.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.423
I told him to lower his music.
That's a crime?

22:17.466 --> 22:20.426
No, but if you return
to the scene a while later

22:20.469 --> 22:22.123
and shoot up the place,
well, that's a crime.

22:22.166 --> 22:25.344
Are you serious? You're here
about the shooting yesterday?

22:25.387 --> 22:26.693
I-I didn't shoot anybody.

22:26.736 --> 22:27.955
But you own a Glock.

22:27.998 --> 22:31.001
Yes, I do, and a full
carry permit for it.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.481
Can we see your gun?

22:32.525 --> 22:34.657
Yeah. Get a warrant.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.704
Look, for a guy who's innocent,

22:37.747 --> 22:39.488
you're being pretty defensive.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.011
I work late nights.

22:41.055 --> 22:43.013
I go to bed sometimes
4:00 in the morning.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.406
Is it too much to ask that jerk

22:44.450 --> 22:46.060
not to blast his music
under my window

22:46.103 --> 22:47.322
when I'm trying to sleep?

22:47.366 --> 22:49.977
And now you're sounding
a little angry.

22:50.020 --> 22:53.372
You know what?
I didn't shoot anyone.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.026
Where were you yesterday
at 11:15?

22:56.070 --> 22:57.854
I never left my apartment.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.335
And the super can verify that
because he was there

23:00.379 --> 23:02.337
with the plumber fixing a leak,

23:02.381 --> 23:03.947
because no one cares
if you work nights.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.732
We'll check it out.

23:05.775 --> 23:08.822
Be my guest.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.519
Maybe Maggie didn't know

23:10.563 --> 23:11.825
what she was talking
about after all.

23:11.868 --> 23:14.654
Okay, what's your problem
with Maggie now?

23:14.697 --> 23:16.743
She's not grounded
in reality.

23:16.786 --> 23:18.745
Well, maybe that's
a good thing.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.964
I mean, we all need
an escape from reality.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.531
Ballistics are back.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.403
The bullet that killed
Michael Carter

23:24.446 --> 23:26.883
matches a gang murder
from five years ago.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.407
And that's why.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.886
Reality sucks.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.199
Miss Harris, thank you
for coming in.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.592
I'm A.D.A. Erin Reagan.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.550
This is Investigator
Abetamarco.

23:41.594 --> 23:44.118
I am Leticia Harris,
representing my mother.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.730
What is this about?Well, I mentioned
on the phone that, uh,

23:47.774 --> 23:50.516
we're taking a look at the
murder of Reggie Lewis.

23:50.559 --> 23:51.952
Is there some new evidence?

23:51.995 --> 23:53.344
An eyewitness.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.259
Who decided to come forward
three decades later.

23:55.303 --> 23:57.958
What was the nature
of your relationship

23:58.001 --> 24:01.004
with Mr. Lewis
at the time of the murder?

24:01.048 --> 24:03.311
We didn't have a relationship.

24:04.399 --> 24:06.314
We heard that
you were dating him.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.055
We might have
gone on a couple dates.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.884
But you just said that
you were not in a relationship.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.799
A date isn't a relationship.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.191
Was he abusive?

24:14.235 --> 24:15.541
What are you getting at?

24:15.584 --> 24:17.499
I'm trying to establish
if your mother

24:17.543 --> 24:19.675
ever fought
with Mr. Lewis.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.984
I don't recall.

24:24.637 --> 24:25.942
Is my mother a suspect?

24:25.986 --> 24:29.642
Your mother
has always been a suspect.

24:29.685 --> 24:30.425
LETICIA:
She already gave

24:30.469 --> 24:31.557
her statements.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.906
Nothing has changed.

24:32.949 --> 24:36.083
Unless you are charging her,
we are leaving.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.920
So what do you think?
She guilty?

24:46.963 --> 24:50.750
I think once we
lift her prints from this,

24:50.793 --> 24:52.795
and run it against
the ones on the gun,

24:52.839 --> 24:54.667
we will see.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.495
You're pretty clever.

24:56.538 --> 24:57.800
Boop.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.236
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have

24:59.280 --> 25:00.847
brought you coffee.I need another refill.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.892
Thank you.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.764
Uh, how is the case going?

25:04.807 --> 25:07.549
Well, the dad's alibi
checked out,

25:07.593 --> 25:11.510
so your intuition about him
being involved

25:11.553 --> 25:12.989
didn't pan out.

25:13.033 --> 25:16.427
It's not intuition.

25:17.603 --> 25:20.519
And I guarantee you the
reason for that baby's death

25:20.562 --> 25:21.955
is because of the father.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.261
Well, I can't afford
to be wrong on this one.

25:24.305 --> 25:27.308
You're not looking
in the right place.

25:27.351 --> 25:28.744
And you got all this
from a sock?

25:28.788 --> 25:30.354
Yeah, I did.

25:30.398 --> 25:33.401
Okay.

25:33.444 --> 25:34.445
I'm sorry.

25:34.489 --> 25:36.491
I'm tired, I'm frustrated.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.233
I know you have a gift.

25:39.276 --> 25:42.279
You really throw yourself
into your work.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.760
Well, I like to think that's
what makes me a good detective.

25:44.804 --> 25:47.154
It also deprives you of joy.

25:47.197 --> 25:48.372
Joy?

25:48.416 --> 25:49.896
When was the last time
that you went out?

25:49.939 --> 25:51.462
I mean, like, out to have fun.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.464
I don't know.
I... I don't know.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.466
I took my son out to a game. I..No, no.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.164
When was the last time
you went out with a woman?

25:57.207 --> 25:58.905
Uh, where you going with this?

25:58.948 --> 26:00.080
No, not romantically, man.

26:00.123 --> 26:02.082
I mean just, like, as a friend

26:02.125 --> 26:04.171
to enjoy her company.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.307
I don't know.

26:10.351 --> 26:12.353
Bye.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.051
Bye.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.320
I'm sure glad they got
that school bus shooter.

26:23.364 --> 26:26.672
Yeah, there's something about
crimes against kids.DANNY: Tell me about it.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.282
I got a vic
who's a five-year-old.

26:28.325 --> 26:29.762
Any closer to the arrest?

26:29.805 --> 26:31.459
No, not yet.

26:31.502 --> 26:35.202
That's what really gets to me:
the murder of the innocents.

26:35.245 --> 26:36.725
Yeah, and hate crimes.

26:36.769 --> 26:38.074
All crimes are hate crimes.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.772
No such thing as a love crime.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.643
I noticed the mayor
held a press conference

26:41.687 --> 26:43.471
for the school bus
shooting arrest on his own.

26:43.514 --> 26:44.646
How come you weren't there?

26:44.690 --> 26:46.735
You have to ask him.

26:46.779 --> 26:48.171
Mm.

26:48.215 --> 26:49.608
Does that mean that the mayor
is pissed at you?

26:50.696 --> 26:53.568
That's exactly what it means.
Good for Francis.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.962
Let me guess--
he's worried about tourism.

26:56.005 --> 26:59.443
He should spend a night
in a radio car answering calls.

26:59.487 --> 27:01.968
Or in an ER with a vic's family.

27:02.011 --> 27:06.407
Have any of you ever thought
about leaving the department?

27:07.843 --> 27:09.105
What do you mean?

27:09.149 --> 27:10.672
Well, the job gets to you.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.675
A case gets to you so much
you feel like packing it in.

27:16.809 --> 27:19.202
Yeah.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.511
Wait a minute, you don't
get to answer that one.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.034
What? It's not thejob,

27:25.078 --> 27:27.123
but it's a job that can
grind you down.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.385
This week in particular

27:28.429 --> 27:30.736
I thought a lot about
how nice it would be

27:30.779 --> 27:32.259
not to be an A.D.A.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.001
You thinking of
a new career, Eddie?

27:35.044 --> 27:36.698
I think Witten is.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.179
She feels like

27:39.222 --> 27:40.528
nobody is on her side.

27:40.571 --> 27:42.704
Well, that's 'cause nobody is.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.967
Well, that's not true.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.577
Eh...

27:46.621 --> 27:48.318
Awful lot of hate directed
at cops, especially lately.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.451
And it's not just cops.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.279
It's like get in line.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.585
It feels like every week
there's some random person

27:54.629 --> 27:56.587
getting attacked on the
streets for no reason.

27:56.631 --> 27:58.720
And you wonder why
he wasn't invited

27:58.764 --> 28:00.156
to the press conference?

28:00.200 --> 28:02.724
How do you get people
to just stop hating?

28:02.768 --> 28:06.119
[scoffs] I don't know,
like this. What we do.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.686
We talk, we listen.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.252
DANNY:
Well,

28:09.296 --> 28:10.993
mostly, you talk,

28:11.037 --> 28:12.908
and we just sit around
and listen.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.171
[laughter]

28:16.607 --> 28:19.393
Well...

28:21.221 --> 28:23.484
ABETEMARCO: Hello.[door closes]

28:23.527 --> 28:27.444
Sandra Harris, uh,
gave us her alibi.

28:27.488 --> 28:30.143
And we compared her prints
with the ones on the gun.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.405
And it's a match.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.059
But you already
knew it would be.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.843
I know what I saw.

28:34.887 --> 28:37.498
You didn't tell us that
she had a daughter your age,

28:37.541 --> 28:39.239
or that you and Leticia were...

28:39.282 --> 28:40.849
Best friends.

28:40.893 --> 28:44.331
You watched your best friend's
mother kill her boyfriend,

28:44.374 --> 28:47.334
and you didn't come forward.Sandra was

28:47.377 --> 28:49.292
a single mom.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.773
I knew if I came forward,
Leticia would have been

28:51.817 --> 28:53.296
put into the system.

28:53.340 --> 28:56.125
Which means two people
would have died that day.

28:56.169 --> 28:58.214
You let her get away
with murder.

28:58.258 --> 29:00.869
Not everything
is black and white, Erin.

29:00.913 --> 29:03.263
Even at 13,
I knew that if I

29:03.306 --> 29:06.135
testified, who would believe
the word of a child?

29:06.179 --> 29:08.181
It wouldn't have been enough.
No one else

29:08.224 --> 29:09.748
came forward because
everyone knew

29:09.791 --> 29:12.359
that Reggie Lewis
used to abuse Sandra.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.056
She always had
marks on her face

29:14.100 --> 29:16.319
that she tried to hide
with makeup.

29:16.363 --> 29:17.451
So you think that's why
she killed him--

29:17.494 --> 29:19.018
she finally had enough?

29:19.061 --> 29:21.150
I really don't know.What you're
basically saying

29:21.194 --> 29:24.284
is it was
a community service murder.

29:24.327 --> 29:26.634
She killed a man in cold blood.

29:26.677 --> 29:28.767
She planned it,
and I watched it,

29:28.810 --> 29:31.247
and I did nothing.

29:31.291 --> 29:33.206
And I'm embarrassed about that.

29:33.249 --> 29:35.251
But do I regret
my decision?

29:35.295 --> 29:38.080
No, I do not.

29:38.124 --> 29:40.126
I was protecting myself,

29:40.169 --> 29:43.912
my family and my friend.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.435
I'd do it again.

29:45.479 --> 29:49.135
This is just not
what I was expecting.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.573
I-I don't know what
I'm supposed to do with this.

29:52.616 --> 29:53.704
Yes, you do.

29:53.748 --> 29:56.098
We're going to arrest
Sandra Harris

29:56.142 --> 29:59.319
for the murder of Reggie Lewis.

30:03.932 --> 30:06.848
You were released from prison
a month ago. You certainly

30:06.892 --> 30:09.242
didn't take long to
look for trouble.

30:09.285 --> 30:10.765
I haven't missed a meeting
with my P.O.,

30:10.809 --> 30:12.375
so you can't be coming here
harassing me.

30:12.419 --> 30:13.681
No one's harassing you.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.204
Okay? We're just asking
a few questions.

30:15.248 --> 30:17.206
So why don't we start with

30:17.250 --> 30:19.643
where were you
on Thursday at 11:15 a.m.?

30:19.687 --> 30:20.601
Why?

30:20.644 --> 30:21.863
A little boy was
shot to death.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.256
The bullets matched
the ones used

30:23.299 --> 30:25.084
in the murder
you did time for.

30:25.127 --> 30:27.390
No way.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.305
I had nothing to do with that.

30:29.349 --> 30:32.439
Okay. You happen
to have any guns here?

30:32.482 --> 30:33.309
No, 'cause that'd be

30:33.353 --> 30:35.137
violating my parole.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.226
Danny.

30:41.013 --> 30:43.319
You mind telling me who that is

30:43.363 --> 30:45.582
in the picture there with you?

30:48.498 --> 30:50.152
It was my girlfriend,
but we broke up.

30:50.196 --> 30:51.806
Girlfriend.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.721
And you were hoping
to get back with her?

30:53.764 --> 30:57.159
Nah. She moved on.
I got no beef with her.

30:57.203 --> 30:59.901
She moved on with another guy.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.381
You were jealous, maybe,

31:01.424 --> 31:03.905
and feeling a little rage
about the fact that

31:03.949 --> 31:06.734
he was raising your son?What are you talking about?

31:06.777 --> 31:10.694
Your son. She's pregnant
in the picture there.

31:10.738 --> 31:13.175
I'm assuming she had
the baby. Your baby.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.568
Little boy named Michael?

31:14.611 --> 31:18.180
It only takes a few minutes
to test DNA.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.182
Michael's my son. So?

31:20.226 --> 31:23.751
So... you didn't even realize

31:23.794 --> 31:25.579
that you murdered your own son?

31:25.622 --> 31:27.537
I didn't shoot Michael.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.324
Well, you might not have
aimed at him,

31:31.367 --> 31:33.587
but that's who you shot.

31:35.719 --> 31:37.330
Who were you aiming at, Jason?

31:37.373 --> 31:41.595
I wasn't aiming at Michael.

31:43.292 --> 31:46.600
I swear, I didn't even
see him there.

31:46.643 --> 31:50.169
You mind stepping over here,
sir, please?

31:50.212 --> 31:51.953
Right here.

31:51.997 --> 31:56.392
Turn around.
Hands behind your back.

31:56.436 --> 31:59.308
Jason Chavez,
you're under arrest

31:59.352 --> 32:01.397
for the murder
of Michael Carter.

32:01.441 --> 32:04.487
His name is Michael Chavez.

32:04.531 --> 32:07.882
I'm his father, not that guy.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.493
Okay. Let's go, Dad.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.497
He hit her.

32:14.541 --> 32:15.803
The crowd started taunting,

32:15.846 --> 32:17.718
and they were
calling us murderers.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.241
You do know you're here
as a witness?

32:19.285 --> 32:20.416
I know why I'm here.

32:20.460 --> 32:21.940
So there's no reason
to be defensive.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.768
If I don't defend
my partner, who will?

32:24.812 --> 32:26.248
We're not here
to prosecute her.

32:26.292 --> 32:27.989
We're just here
to find the truth.The truth?

32:28.033 --> 32:31.601
She's a great cop who's being
raked over the coals

32:31.645 --> 32:33.168
for no reason.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.649
She pulled her weapon
on an unarmed man.Perp.

32:35.692 --> 32:37.172
And showed no visible injuries.

32:37.216 --> 32:39.348
Why don't I tell you about
the invisible injuries?

32:39.392 --> 32:40.567
You want to hear about those?

32:40.610 --> 32:42.351
How about you just
answer our questions?

32:42.395 --> 32:45.615
Why does it feel like
she is being presumed guilty

32:45.659 --> 32:47.356
until proven innocent?

32:47.400 --> 32:49.271
Isn't it supposed to be
the other way around?

32:49.315 --> 32:52.013
We haven't made
a final determination

32:52.057 --> 32:55.016
You are supposed
to be impartial.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.583
But that's what's wrong,
right, these days?

32:56.626 --> 32:58.672
Nobody's impartial.

32:58.715 --> 33:01.370
Cops are hated.

33:01.414 --> 33:04.939
That hate is infecting
this whole city,

33:04.983 --> 33:07.202
and frankly, it's infecting
this investigation.

33:07.246 --> 33:09.944
Because you can take
whatever you want,

33:09.988 --> 33:11.990
and you can twist it
to suit whatever

33:12.033 --> 33:14.122
you have already determined.

33:14.166 --> 33:17.125
But she's done nothing wrong.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.345
Are you done?

33:19.388 --> 33:21.521
Can we get on with
the questions now?

33:24.393 --> 33:26.308
What do you got?

33:26.352 --> 33:29.964
I promised the community
a bigger police presence.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.880
I know.
I watched the press conference.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.144
Gonna be tough
to make good on that

33:36.188 --> 33:38.016
with less police and less money.I'm not

33:38.059 --> 33:40.801
discussing rolling back
policies with you.

33:40.844 --> 33:42.455
Right now, my job is

33:42.498 --> 33:44.413
to get the city
back up to speed.

33:44.457 --> 33:47.242
The victim's parents
will be thrilled to hear that.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.157
There's always gonna be
random crime.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.854
And there is going
to be more of it

33:50.898 --> 33:52.030
if you don't work with me.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.379
"Work with you" translates to

33:53.422 --> 33:54.771
lift all the restrictions

33:54.815 --> 33:56.077
on your department.

33:56.121 --> 33:58.471
Reinstate Anti-Crime,
hire more cops.

33:58.514 --> 33:59.863
Great. Glad we agree.

33:59.907 --> 34:02.214
Answer's no. Let's move on.

34:04.433 --> 34:08.089
I heard you have an arrest
in that other shooting.

34:08.133 --> 34:09.786
We do.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.006
That's great.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.834
We should announce it
this afternoon.

34:13.877 --> 34:16.141
You can announce it.
I don't need to be there.

34:16.184 --> 34:17.490
You'll be there.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.883
I am not going to
stand next to you

34:19.927 --> 34:22.799
and pretend your policies
are working when they are not.

34:22.843 --> 34:25.106
Yeah, policies, plural.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.890
And some of mine
are working damn well.

34:26.934 --> 34:29.589
And yes, there's gonna be
some less-than-ideal impact

34:29.632 --> 34:31.634
in other areas,
and that's called

34:31.678 --> 34:33.245
governing in the real world.

34:33.288 --> 34:34.985
Me wanting to grow
back our economy

34:35.029 --> 34:38.380
isn't what's causing
your crime wave, Frank.

34:38.424 --> 34:40.295
My crime wave?

34:40.339 --> 34:43.168
It is your department.

34:43.211 --> 34:47.302
Well, at least
you got that right.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.785
[sighs]

35:03.666 --> 35:05.190
Did you make an arrest?

35:05.233 --> 35:06.582
I did.

35:06.626 --> 35:09.759
It was the father.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.152
The biological father.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.849
Oh.Apparently he was

35:12.893 --> 35:15.504
trying to shoot
Michael's stepdad

35:15.548 --> 35:18.812
'cause he was jealous
that he was raising

35:18.855 --> 35:20.161
his son as his own.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.294
Mm-hmm.Jealousy and rage.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.818
You were right, again.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.776
I wish I wasn't.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.822
You were also right about me.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.825
With Linda. I...

35:31.868 --> 35:34.219
I don't know, I...

35:34.262 --> 35:37.657
buried myself into my work
after she passed away,

35:37.700 --> 35:39.659
and I've talked to people
and tried

35:39.702 --> 35:41.182
to pull myself out of it,

35:41.226 --> 35:43.663
but somehow it seems
I just keep getting

35:43.706 --> 35:45.186
buried deeper in the job.

35:45.230 --> 35:48.320
I mean, my job
is not the same as yours,

35:48.363 --> 35:51.192
but it takes
a big emotional toll.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.672
I wouldn't be able
to continue doing it

35:52.715 --> 35:56.719
if I didn't let off some steam
every now and then.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.417
I'm trying.You know,

35:58.460 --> 36:02.334
there is a great karaoke place
two blocks away,

36:02.377 --> 36:06.033
and the only thing killer
are the margaritas.

36:06.076 --> 36:08.818
Karaoke's...
I-I don't think so.

36:08.862 --> 36:11.081
Come on, just two friends.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.040
I guarantee
you will have a great time.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.868
I know, and I thank you.
I just...

36:14.911 --> 36:15.912
Maybe another time.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.087
Okay.Okay.

36:17.131 --> 36:19.177
What are you gonna do with it?

36:19.220 --> 36:20.221
With...

36:20.265 --> 36:21.657
the sock.The sock.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.224
Uh-huh.

36:23.268 --> 36:26.227
You know, actually,
I was gonna give it

36:26.271 --> 36:27.750
to Michael's stepdad.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.492
The real man who raised him.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.015
I think that's good.

36:32.059 --> 36:33.582
Yeah.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.889
You don't have to carry
that stuff around, you know.

36:35.932 --> 36:37.195
I know.

36:39.762 --> 36:40.676
Hey.Hey.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.200
You meet your 18-year-old self,

36:42.243 --> 36:44.463
and you can only say
three words. What do you say?

36:44.506 --> 36:48.771
Skip law school. You?

36:48.815 --> 36:50.164
I don't know.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.339
How'd it go with IAB?

36:51.383 --> 36:53.472
Even if Witten
is returned to full duty,

36:53.515 --> 36:55.561
she's not sure she even wants
to be a cop.

36:55.604 --> 36:57.476
If you don't think
you can do this job,

36:57.519 --> 36:58.868
then you can't.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.348
[sighs]It challenges you
in so many ways,

37:00.392 --> 37:01.871
not the least of
which is up here.

37:01.915 --> 37:03.308
Especially lately.

37:03.351 --> 37:04.831
If she's not up for it,

37:04.874 --> 37:07.573
then she should leave
the Department.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.749
But it's not that
she's not strong enough,

37:09.792 --> 37:12.752
it's that the bad
is far outweighing the good.

37:12.795 --> 37:16.277
Not for everyone.
Not for you.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.236
That's true.

37:19.802 --> 37:23.284
But it's not like I've
experienced much good lately.

37:23.328 --> 37:26.026
Oh, yeah?
Well, hop in.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.332
Where are we going?

37:27.375 --> 37:30.030
You'll see, let's go.Get in.

37:30.073 --> 37:32.641
Take your hands off of her!
Why are you arresting her?

37:32.685 --> 37:35.078
Stop right now.
Take your hands off of her.

37:35.122 --> 37:36.254
Why are you arresting her?

37:36.297 --> 37:37.820
For the murder of Reggie Lewis.

37:37.864 --> 37:41.302
You have no evidence.
No witnesses.

37:41.346 --> 37:44.436
I saw her do it.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.442
Kim...

37:51.530 --> 37:53.401
Why are you doing this?

37:53.445 --> 37:56.099
I'm sorry.You're sorry?

37:56.143 --> 37:59.233
My mother is 65 years old.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.583
Reggie Lewis was 37.

38:01.627 --> 38:02.584
Mom.

38:02.628 --> 38:04.412
Mom, do not
say a word to the cops

38:04.456 --> 38:06.414
or the D.A.'s office.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.286
You cannot trust them.

38:09.156 --> 38:11.419
Come on, ma'am.

38:13.203 --> 38:14.553
You have nothing.

38:14.596 --> 38:17.599
Your mother's prints
are on the murder weapon.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.387
I'm a lawyer.

38:22.430 --> 38:23.997
I don't want anyone
talking to her

38:24.040 --> 38:25.477
unless I am present.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.087
That's fine.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.567
You'll never get a conviction.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.525
We'll see about that.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.579
This'll be your case.
I'll have to recuse myself.

38:40.622 --> 38:43.582
I'm sorry.
Opening this case,

38:43.625 --> 38:45.192
I thought I was helping.

38:45.235 --> 38:48.848
The next time you want
to help me, please don't.

39:14.264 --> 39:16.484
♪

39:31.369 --> 39:33.545
♪

39:45.687 --> 39:49.430
We're back at the scene
of the crime. Why?

39:49.474 --> 39:51.519
Can you get the trunk
for me?

39:51.563 --> 39:54.043
Anybody order some
new plexiglass?

39:54.087 --> 39:56.742
Officer Reagan.What are you doing?

39:56.785 --> 39:58.483
I came to, uh,
replace the plexiglass

39:58.526 --> 39:59.484
here on your counter.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.486
I don't understand.

40:01.529 --> 40:02.748
Also gonna have some
uniformed officers come by

40:02.791 --> 40:05.359
and check on your store
a few times a day.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.882
Thank you.

40:06.926 --> 40:08.362
Good.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.104
All right, well, you got
Phillips-head that'll fit these?

40:16.022 --> 40:17.371
Hmm.

40:17.415 --> 40:21.419
Three words that I would say
to my 18-year-old self.

40:21.462 --> 40:22.550
Mm-hmm.

40:22.594 --> 40:26.032
Marry Jamie Reagan.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.039
Hey.

40:33.082 --> 40:36.477
That's a pretty girly drink.Well, I can be

40:36.521 --> 40:38.044
girly sometimes.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.437
I got you a beer.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.613
Perfect. You read my mind.

40:43.005 --> 40:46.356
I am regretting
opening this case.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.576
I didn't know
how complicated it would get.

40:48.620 --> 40:50.491
Well, it gets
even more complicated.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.667
Turns out Reggie Lewis
also has kids.

40:52.711 --> 40:56.018
In fact, one of 'em's
a congresswoman in Brooklyn.

40:56.062 --> 40:57.585
Shannon Lewis?

40:57.629 --> 41:00.893
She heard about the arrest.
She's planned a press conference

41:00.936 --> 41:03.069
on the steps of Borough Hall
tomorrow.

41:03.112 --> 41:04.723
Great.

41:04.766 --> 41:06.725
You got any other good news?

41:06.768 --> 41:08.553
If it makes you feel any better,

41:08.596 --> 41:10.816
I admire you for what you do.

41:12.165 --> 41:14.733
For sticking my nose
where it doesn't belong

41:14.776 --> 41:16.822
and embarrassing my boss.

41:16.865 --> 41:18.301
Look, Sandra Harris
killed a guy,

41:18.345 --> 41:20.608
and a life is a life
no matter how complicated

41:20.652 --> 41:22.480
it makes things for Crawford.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.699
She probably hates me now.

41:24.743 --> 41:27.485
Nah.
She hated you way before this.

41:27.528 --> 41:30.009
Thanks.

41:33.186 --> 41:34.361

41:34.404 --> 41:36.450

for Sheryl!

41:36.494 --> 41:38.626
[cheering]

41:40.367 --> 41:41.499
That was good.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.152
Fun, right?

41:43.196 --> 41:44.632
You ever get up there
and grab the mic?

41:44.676 --> 41:45.851
Course I do.Mm.

41:45.894 --> 41:48.331
What's your karaoke
go-to song?

41:48.375 --> 41:49.985
"I Will Survive."

41:50.029 --> 41:51.900
Mm, Gloria Gaynor.

41:51.944 --> 41:55.251
That's a kick-ass song.Thank you. Uh...

41:55.295 --> 41:56.862
I see what you're doing there.

41:56.905 --> 41:58.864
I'm not doing anything,
that's really my favorite song.

41:58.907 --> 42:02.215
Okay, who's next up?

42:05.610 --> 42:08.134
Me!

42:08.177 --> 42:10.223
I'm next.

42:11.398 --> 42:12.617
What are you doing?

42:12.660 --> 42:16.403
You said I should
start having some fun.

42:16.446 --> 42:18.361
Let's have some fun.

42:18.405 --> 42:20.842
