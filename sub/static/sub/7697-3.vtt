WEBVTT

01:30.715 --> 01:33.801
I'm gonna check the parking lot, Billy.
Try to stay awake, huh?

01:33.884 --> 01:36.679
Hey, it's not
past my bedtime, old man.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.451
Whoa!

01:58.534 --> 01:59.785
I didn't hear you come back.

02:00.202 --> 02:02.663
Sorry, I forgot to check
Mr. Tarnower's office.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.373
I better do that now.

02:37.990 --> 02:39.450
What in the name of...

02:43.871 --> 02:45.581
Looks like a slow night, Alfred.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.000
When I finish patrolling this area,
I'm heading home.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.252
<i>Excellent timing, Master Bruce.</i>

02:50.336 --> 02:52.046
<i>I've just taken dinner out of the oven.</i>

02:54.590 --> 02:57.051
Looks like trouble
at Tarnower Financial, Alfred.

02:57.134 --> 02:58.511
I won't be home early after all.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.722
Please don't take this
the wrong way, sir,

03:01.806 --> 03:03.683
but your goose is cooked.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.039
Step away from the safe. Now!

03:27.581 --> 03:29.500
Do it, man. I'm cocked!

03:36.173 --> 03:37.258
Mr. Tarnower?

03:37.550 --> 03:39.593
What did you expect? Batman?

03:40.136 --> 03:43.556
You should be downstairs guarding
the door. What do I pay you for?

03:43.889 --> 03:46.267
Yes, sir. Sorry. I thought...

03:46.767 --> 03:49.019
Hey, what happened to your accent?

03:49.103 --> 03:50.896
And aren't you supposed to be in Hawaii?

04:00.656 --> 04:03.951
Batman? Thank goodness you're here.
I caught a thief.

05:32.289 --> 05:35.709
Hagen, I offered to help you
become human again.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.461
The offer still stands.

05:37.878 --> 05:40.297
I don't need your help, Batman.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.217
Have it your way.

05:57.606 --> 06:00.442
You used to be faster, Hagen.
Not to mention neater.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.718
Matthew, get in.

07:03.797 --> 07:05.215
Stella.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.594
There, there.
It's gonna be all right, Matthew.

07:08.677 --> 07:12.097
I'II fix everything. Don't you worry.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.141
It'll be all right.

07:14.224 --> 07:17.978
I'll take care of you.
I won't let anything happen to you.

07:49.885 --> 07:52.096
It's okay now, Matthew.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.140
Sleep, my darling.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.529
Am I correct in
assuming metamorphic Mr. Hagen

08:08.612 --> 08:10.114
is back in town, sir?

08:10.322 --> 08:12.616
Back, but not for long, I'd guess.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.577
It seems that Clayface
is losing his integrity.

08:15.911 --> 08:18.414
I wasn't aware that he ever had any
to begin with.

08:18.789 --> 08:21.333
I'm speaking in
a physiological sense, Alfred.

08:22.626 --> 08:25.671
Based on destructive ultrasonic analysis
of the sample,

08:25.838 --> 08:28.966
the molecular bonding
of his clay flesh is breaking down.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.719
He's falling apart, literally.

08:32.344 --> 08:33.512
How grotesque.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.805
Tea?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.477
Whatever medical process he's using
to keep himself together

08:40.561 --> 08:41.603
must cost a fortune.

08:42.229 --> 08:44.064
Which is why he's committing robberies.

08:44.356 --> 08:47.401
And that woman helping him,
what's her stake in this?

08:47.484 --> 08:49.820
Mmm. Perhaps she enjoys mud baths.

08:57.786 --> 09:02.207
<i>The surgery was a success, Eric...
I mean, Senator Chandler.</i>

09:07.588 --> 09:11.550
<i>Oh, darling, how wonderful.
Let's get married right away.</i>

09:28.942 --> 09:30.694
<i>Susan. Wait.</i>

09:31.653 --> 09:34.490
<i>I love you, Susan.
You cured more than my body,</i>

09:35.032 --> 09:36.366
<i>you cured my heart.</i>

09:48.962 --> 09:51.215
- Turn it off!
- Matthew?

09:56.637 --> 09:58.222
That's not me anymore.

10:01.016 --> 10:03.477
I'm sorry, Matthew.
I didn't think you'd be awake yet.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.272
I don't know if I can stand this
much longer.

10:07.815 --> 10:11.026
Trapped in this suit,
surviving on chemicals.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.319
It's a nightmare!

10:15.072 --> 10:16.073
Stella.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.658
I'm sorry.

10:18.617 --> 10:20.577
I know I owe everything to you.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.163
You cured more than my body,

10:23.705 --> 10:25.040
you cured my heart.

10:25.290 --> 10:28.502
I have something to show you, Matthew.
Something new.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.897
Now, watch.

10:52.276 --> 10:55.404
- How did you do that?
- A new isotope.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.491
MP-40. An experimental
mutagenic adaptogen.

10:59.783 --> 11:01.243
I believe it can restore,

11:01.326 --> 11:04.913
maybe even increase your powers,
perhaps permanently.

11:05.289 --> 11:08.542
You can become
Matt Hagen again, forever.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.460
Where can we get this stuff?

11:10.586 --> 11:14.715
Well, that's a problem. The only
large source is Wayne Biomedical Labs.

11:15.507 --> 11:17.634
It's rare and it will be well-protected.

11:17.718 --> 11:21.847
Protected from human thieves, maybe,
but not from Clayface.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.308
No, Matthew. It's too risky.

11:24.516 --> 11:27.769
Without the suit, your structural
integrity could go at any time.

11:28.061 --> 11:29.229
It's worth the risk.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.065
I'm not spending the rest
of my life like this.

11:45.787 --> 11:47.289
Anything interesting yet, Alfred?

11:47.998 --> 11:51.960
It appears his past dealings with women
had nothing to do with medicine, sir.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.922
No record so far of any female doctors.

11:55.255 --> 11:58.717
Keep looking.
If we find her, we find him.

12:23.992 --> 12:25.661
Let's cut to the chase.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.913
The MP-40, where is it?

12:51.311 --> 12:54.314
A monster. There's a monster in the lab!

12:54.648 --> 12:57.359
Okay, okay. Just take it easy.
We'll handle it.

13:49.745 --> 13:53.790
Look at that lady, Mommy.
She's got mud all over her.

14:05.385 --> 14:08.597
Ew! Mommy, she's melting!

14:10.515 --> 14:12.351
- What is it?
- Let me out of here.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.019
- Oh, gross!
- Coming through.

14:14.102 --> 14:16.188
- God, that smells.
- Oh, I'm gonna be sick!

14:16.271 --> 14:17.439
Come on.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.860
That's it, run.
Run for your measly lives.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.779
Run from Clayface!

14:41.046 --> 14:42.672
You're dead meat, Batman.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.175
No room to dodge. I gotcha cold.

14:45.425 --> 14:47.010
Other way around, Hagen.

15:45.402 --> 15:48.530
There's nothing here about
any women doctors, Master Bruce.

15:48.613 --> 15:51.616
The ladies Mr. Hagen knew
were generally of a less, uh,

15:52.284 --> 15:53.869
intellectual class.

15:54.035 --> 15:55.328
We're missing something.

15:55.537 --> 15:56.830
I can't imagine what.

15:56.913 --> 15:59.541
Closest thing Hagen had
to a relationship with a doctor

15:59.749 --> 16:03.253
was in the film <i>Dark Interlude.</i>
In it, he plays Eric Chandler,

16:03.420 --> 16:06.715
a senator who falls in love
with the plastic surgeon treating him.

16:06.798 --> 16:08.758
That's it. His movies!

16:09.259 --> 16:11.803
- Master Bruce?
- No time to explain now, Alfred.

16:12.220 --> 16:13.513
There never is.

16:43.376 --> 16:45.128
I... I can feel it.

16:49.257 --> 16:50.258
Yes.

16:50.550 --> 16:52.636
Yes! It's working.

17:00.310 --> 17:03.146
Batman. No, turn it back on.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.689
I was so close.

17:04.981 --> 17:09.069
So close!
I almost felt like Matt Hagen again.

17:09.861 --> 17:11.196
How did you find us?

17:11.363 --> 17:14.991
I realized you must've used a medical
consultant on some of your films.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.827
I found Dr. Bates' name
in an old film log.

17:18.286 --> 17:19.746
Dr. Bates had once owned a motel,

17:19.829 --> 17:22.082
but sold it to get money for this,
Iexpect

17:22.290 --> 17:24.751
This was the address the bank had
in its files.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.171
It's over, Hagen.
The lab boys can take it from here.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.864
You've upstaged me
for the last time, Batman.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.036
Time to bring down the curtain.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.506
Time for your final bow, Batman.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.010
Matthew, no! You can't.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.264
It's the only way.

18:26.479 --> 18:27.814
Please, stop it.

18:28.315 --> 18:32.611
Think, Stella.
Do you want Matt Hagen or this?

18:33.612 --> 18:34.613
No-

18:38.950 --> 18:41.036
No, you don't!

18:42.871 --> 18:44.623
Is... Is he...

18:46.333 --> 18:47.542
Almost.

18:47.792 --> 18:49.628
I can feel his heart slowing.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.671
Slowing.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.302
Huh?

19:52.399 --> 19:54.442
Matthew, get back inside!

19:55.151 --> 19:58.488
You're absorbing the rain! Matthew!

20:11.584 --> 20:12.585
No.

20:13.169 --> 20:15.547
We finish this now.

20:37.068 --> 20:39.821
Save him, Batman. Please!

20:40.196 --> 20:43.241
Come on, Hagen. Pull yourself together.

20:47.746 --> 20:48.955
Too late.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.499
Curtain's going...

20:53.626 --> 20:55.879
- Down.
- Hagen!

22:17.544 --> 22:18.545
English - SDH
