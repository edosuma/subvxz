You killed my friend.

00:08.406 --> 00:11.266
An alchemist used a stone
to keep my body from aging.

00:11.289 --> 00:13.852
If I blow your heart out of your chest,
do you think that will stop you?

00:13.891 --> 00:17.289
I'm gonna guess that's Charlotte.
No! Myka!

00:17.578 --> 00:19.148
A poisoned dart.

00:19.945 --> 00:21.664
A 15-year-old boy?

00:21.781 --> 00:24.148
Yeah.
Nick Powell.

00:24.211 --> 00:25.938
Why don't you come back
to South Dakota with us?

00:25.969 --> 00:27.765
Nick. Hey.
How's it going, man?

00:33.023 --> 00:35.391
We could be looking
at ovarian cancer.

- Hey.

00:51.971 --> 00:55.314
- What are you doing up?
- It's time for my 3:00 AM sandwich.

00:55.541 --> 00:58.306
- It's 1:00 AM.
- I'm still on East Coast time.

00:58.486 --> 01:01.040
What's your excuse? Oh, wait.
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

01:01.156 --> 01:04.539
Let me guess.
You're re-reading the manual... again.

01:06.758 --> 01:08.820
Do you remember
our first night here?

01:09.820 --> 01:11.930
It was all so new
and exciting.

01:12.172 --> 01:14.265
A world of endless wonder.

01:14.617 --> 01:16.875
I'm just so glad
that we got to see it.

01:19.594 --> 01:21.203
Okay, what's wrong?

01:27.359 --> 01:28.952
Pete, I have cancer.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.118
No.

01:37.186 --> 01:38.439
No.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.775
You went to the doctor
three days ago,

01:40.809 --> 01:42.235
and--and you're
just telling me now?

01:42.260 --> 01:43.644
[Mocking]
I have cancer.

01:43.695 --> 01:45.029
[Overlapping]
You're just telling me now?

01:45.063 --> 01:46.197
Myka, are you gonna die?

01:46.231 --> 01:48.932
[Laughs]

01:48.951 --> 01:50.151
Myka?

01:50.202 --> 01:51.172
Is something wrong?

01:51.286 --> 01:52.172
What?

01:52.344 --> 01:53.738
No.
Ha.

01:53.772 --> 01:55.539
No, I was just thinking

01:55.574 --> 01:57.893
about... stuff.

01:59.472 --> 02:00.622
Let's go get you your sandwich.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.091
Yeah.

02:03.125 --> 02:04.176
Shh.

02:04.227 --> 02:05.594
- Shh. We can't wake up Pete.
- Why?

02:05.628 --> 02:07.295
Because I'm starving.

02:07.313 --> 02:08.979
I'm about to steal
his 3:00 AM sandwich.

02:09.014 --> 02:10.482
- Okay.
- Hey, Claud.

02:10.515 --> 02:12.133
Uh, Steve was looking
for you earlier.

02:12.151 --> 02:14.135
Yeah. No, I gathered
from his copious texts,

02:14.153 --> 02:15.136
emails, and phone calls.

02:15.154 --> 02:17.355
- Hello!
- Oh, so close!

02:17.406 --> 02:18.473
Why aren't you asleep?

02:18.491 --> 02:20.659
Sleep is for suckers, okay?

02:20.693 --> 02:22.911
It's hoagie time up in here.

02:22.945 --> 02:25.313
Ah, listen, we got a ping!
A big one!

02:25.331 --> 02:28.149
This is something I've been
after a long time.

02:28.167 --> 02:30.669
This is an old--Nick?

02:30.703 --> 02:33.672
You're here... listening.

02:33.706 --> 02:35.924
Yeah, uh, Claudia and I
just got back--

02:35.958 --> 02:37.008
That's nice.
It's late.

02:37.043 --> 02:39.177
You look tired.

02:42.014 --> 02:43.014
I th--

02:44.717 --> 02:47.004
I thought you told me
you would find a place for him

02:47.129 --> 02:48.596
that was not here.

02:48.630 --> 02:50.465
Well, yeah, I mean, there
aren't a lot of alternatives

02:50.499 --> 02:51.933
to foster care
for a kid like Nick.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.501
I've got a little more
digging to do, but--

02:53.519 --> 02:54.835
Then good, go dig.

02:54.853 --> 02:56.187
And listen, in case nobody's
ever told you this

02:56.221 --> 02:57.605
the Warehouse
happens to be a secret!

02:57.639 --> 02:59.340
Oh, good.
Thank you.

02:59.358 --> 03:00.341
Let me warm that up for you.

03:00.359 --> 03:01.809
- Whoa, whoa! No!
- Sucker.

03:01.843 --> 03:02.810
Come on, let's go, let's go,
let's go.

03:02.844 --> 03:03.895
Wait, is there any way

03:03.946 --> 03:05.530
that this ping could wait
until tomorrow?

03:05.564 --> 03:07.615
No, no, can't wait.
I've been waiting for years.

03:07.649 --> 03:09.067
We have to act right now.

03:09.118 --> 03:11.703
Or what, you won't make
Warehouse employee of the month?

03:11.737 --> 03:13.071
Of the century!

03:13.122 --> 03:16.074
Listen, we let this slip through
our fingers right now,

03:16.125 --> 03:17.325
we may never get it again.

03:17.359 --> 03:19.293
Or worse, somebody could
swoop in and claim it.

03:19.328 --> 03:20.962
Swoop in and claim what?

03:20.996 --> 03:24.048
It's the treasure
of Roaring Dan Seavey.

03:24.083 --> 03:25.500
- Roaring D--who?
- He's a pirate.

03:25.534 --> 03:28.720
A pirate who stole a collection
of artifacts from Warehouse 12.

03:28.754 --> 03:31.639
And we are gonna
steal them back.

03:33.142 --> 03:36.043
During the transition between
Warehouse 12 and Warehouse 13

03:36.061 --> 03:38.896
the <i>HMS Avalon,</i>
which was a cargo ship,

03:38.931 --> 03:40.231
was laden with artifacts.

03:40.265 --> 03:43.351
It was besieged off
the Atlantic Coast by pirates.

03:43.385 --> 03:45.103
Led by Roaring Dan Seavey,

03:45.154 --> 03:46.821
these brigands
looted the <i>Avalon,</i>

03:46.855 --> 03:48.889
absconding with several crates
of artifacts

03:48.907 --> 03:51.392
and claiming the life
of Agent David Wolcott.

03:51.410 --> 03:52.660
[Chuckles]
Oh, man.

03:52.694 --> 03:54.028
Killed by a pirate?

03:54.062 --> 03:56.414
That's how I wanna go out.

03:56.448 --> 03:57.999
Ooh!

03:58.033 --> 04:00.334
So whatever happened
to Dan Seavey?

04:00.369 --> 04:01.702
Vanished for 100 years.

04:01.736 --> 04:04.738
No Warehouse agent has ever
been able to find him

04:04.757 --> 04:07.008
or the artifacts that he stole.

04:07.042 --> 04:09.127
But I have a lead.

04:09.178 --> 04:11.912
This is 1/2 of a puzzle box

04:11.930 --> 04:13.848
that was actually built
by Roaring Dan.

04:13.882 --> 04:16.684
I, 18 years ago, borrowed it
from the Smithsonian.

04:16.718 --> 04:17.918
And I know that when

04:17.935 --> 04:19.519
the two halves of the box
are put together,

04:19.555 --> 04:22.190
it will somehow reveal
where his hideout is.

04:22.224 --> 04:23.441
Now, when you say "borrowed"--

04:23.475 --> 04:26.427
And Dan was notoriously
pa--no.

04:26.445 --> 04:29.864
Paranoid about the location
and protecting his stash.

04:29.898 --> 04:31.599
So I'm assuming that your lead

04:31.617 --> 04:32.933
is the other half
of that puzzle box?

04:32.951 --> 04:34.118
Yes, that's right.

04:34.153 --> 04:35.319
I managed to trace it

04:35.370 --> 04:37.989
to a black market dealer
in antiquities,

04:38.040 --> 04:41.042
and I finally convinced him
to let us buy his half.

04:41.076 --> 04:43.795
Ha!

04:43.829 --> 04:45.413
One condition.

04:45.447 --> 04:46.831
We have to meet this dealer
in Upstate New York

04:46.882 --> 04:49.717
in exactly five hours
or the deal is off.

04:49.751 --> 04:51.002
Why so small a window?

04:51.053 --> 04:52.887
Well, black market dealers,

04:52.921 --> 04:54.288
they tend to be
a little skittish.

04:54.306 --> 04:55.556
They don't want to give time
for their buyers

04:55.591 --> 04:56.624
to bring the authorities.

04:56.642 --> 04:58.426
But now we need to get a move on

04:58.460 --> 05:00.127
and shuffle off to Buffalo.

05:00.145 --> 05:02.730
Ah, yes, Buffalo.
Birthplace of the hot wing.

05:02.764 --> 05:04.565
Healthiest part
of the chicken.

05:06.401 --> 05:09.821

05:09.855 --> 05:12.490

05:12.524 --> 05:14.525
Mm. What is all this stuff

05:14.576 --> 05:15.976
and does it have
anything to do with me?

05:15.994 --> 05:17.328
Backlog mission reports

05:17.362 --> 05:19.030
and, no,
I drew the short straw,

05:19.081 --> 05:20.998
- but you're welcome to help.
- Mm. Pass.

05:21.033 --> 05:23.618
Oh, by the way,
thanks for maxing out

05:23.652 --> 05:27.038
my voice, text, and data plans,
Mr. Cyber Stalker.

05:27.089 --> 05:28.873
Well, if I was stalking you
I would have known

05:28.924 --> 05:30.591
where you were
at 1:00 in the morning.

05:30.626 --> 05:33.261
I took Nick
to a Dead Rent concert,

05:33.295 --> 05:35.930
and it's a long drive back
from Featherhead, mom.

05:35.964 --> 05:37.765
Still, wouldn't have
killed you to call.

05:37.799 --> 05:40.384
Okay.

05:40.435 --> 05:42.687
You, sir,
are in an official snit.

05:42.721 --> 05:44.171
What gives?

05:44.189 --> 05:46.023
- It's Nick.
- What about him?

05:46.058 --> 05:47.841
He's been here three days,

05:47.860 --> 05:49.610
and I still haven't heard
an honest word from him.

05:49.645 --> 05:52.280
Even a simple question like
"Where are you from?"

05:52.314 --> 05:53.731
He dodges it like a bullet.

05:53.782 --> 05:57.034
Huh. A kid from the streets
lying to an adult he just met.

05:57.069 --> 05:58.703
That never happens.

05:58.737 --> 06:00.738
You need to be
more careful around him.

06:00.789 --> 06:03.824
He's 15 and homeless.

06:03.858 --> 06:06.077
He's withdrawn,
guarded, mistrustful.

06:06.128 --> 06:07.578
Three of my best friends
at that age.

06:07.629 --> 06:10.081
And I get that you wanna
protect him. I do.

06:10.132 --> 06:12.583
All I'm saying is just...

06:12.634 --> 06:15.202
Keep your eyes open, okay?

06:15.220 --> 06:18.723
And do you think you could
maybe be a little more

06:18.757 --> 06:20.558
older brother
and less big brother?

06:20.592 --> 06:21.976
Mm-hmm.

06:22.010 --> 06:24.345
Okay, deal.

06:24.379 --> 06:26.564
Now I must go bathe in caffeine.

06:40.078 --> 06:41.729
Was everything all right?

[English accent]
I'm in, aren't I?

06:44.917 --> 06:47.118
I'll text you
when we're a go.

06:47.169 --> 06:49.036
This one can't be traced.

06:53.258 --> 06:55.176
And don't forget to floss,
dear.

07:21.153 --> 07:22.536
I don't know,
kind of a strange place

07:22.571 --> 07:24.205
to be selling
a priceless antiquity.

07:24.239 --> 07:25.539
You're right,
we should be looking

07:25.574 --> 07:26.874
for a quaint little storefront--
ye olde black market.

07:26.908 --> 07:28.993
Any idea what
this dealer looks like?

07:29.044 --> 07:31.329
No, but when we find him,
my name is Mr. Fisher.

07:31.380 --> 07:32.330
- You got it? Fisher.
- Fisher.

why don't you just
do it to my face?

08:00.192 --> 08:03.361
Okay, so... Claudia told you
about our conversation.

08:03.412 --> 08:05.663
- It's just--
- 'Cause you're right.

08:05.697 --> 08:10.167
I haven't been honest with you.
I'm really sorry.

really nice.

Exquisite, isn't it?

09:50.352 --> 09:52.303
It's kind of a coincidence
that you have it,

09:52.354 --> 09:53.587
don't you think, Char?

09:53.605 --> 09:55.306
I collect items
of historical significance,

09:55.357 --> 09:56.774
Mr. Lattimer.

09:56.808 --> 09:59.927
And what a storied past
lies behind this little beauty.

09:59.945 --> 10:02.229
Could we just please
move this along?

10:02.263 --> 10:06.317
When we last met,
you people broke into my home.

10:06.368 --> 10:08.869
You stole from me.
And, oh, yes...

10:08.904 --> 10:10.287
You shot me,

10:10.322 --> 10:12.790
which might explain
my being cautious.

10:12.824 --> 10:14.274
Okay, you started it
with the shotgun.

10:14.292 --> 10:16.660
Nevertheless,
if you want my half,

10:16.711 --> 10:17.945
it's going to cost you.

10:17.963 --> 10:19.964
Good, fine--
what's the price?

10:19.998 --> 10:22.115
Oh, no, no, I'm not interested
in chump change, Mr. Nielsen.

10:22.134 --> 10:25.636
No, no, I have got my eye
on a far greater prize.

10:25.670 --> 10:27.805
What do you want?

10:27.839 --> 10:30.123
Dan Seavey was one of the most
successful pirates

10:30.142 --> 10:31.509
of his time.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.345
His unrecovered fortune
would be worth, whew,

10:34.396 --> 10:36.296
tens of millions today.

10:36.314 --> 10:38.065
But, you see,
I need your half

10:38.099 --> 10:40.151
of the puzzle box
to get it.

10:40.185 --> 10:42.486
- We don't have the puzzle box.
- I don't have it.

10:42.521 --> 10:44.137
Oh, please.

10:44.156 --> 10:45.689
It was stolen
from the Smithsonian

10:45.740 --> 10:47.992
18 years ago by a man
wielding a ray gun,

10:48.026 --> 10:50.077
which, at the time, sounded
positively absurd,

10:50.111 --> 10:52.312
until you two
zapped me with one!

10:52.330 --> 10:54.248
So... thought I'd put
my half up for sale

10:54.282 --> 10:55.916
and see if I could
smoke you out.

10:55.951 --> 10:58.085
Oh, f-fine!
We have half the puzzle box!

10:58.119 --> 11:00.421
Our half, not for sale.

11:00.455 --> 11:01.922
Hmm.
Thought as much.

11:01.957 --> 11:03.290
But, you see,
I would be willing

11:03.324 --> 11:05.376
to combine
our respective halves

11:05.427 --> 11:07.678
and split Dan's fortune
50/50.

11:07.712 --> 11:11.015
Now, you can't say
that's not fair.

11:11.049 --> 11:12.433
Partners?

11:12.467 --> 11:13.717
- Can we just--
- Wait, wait, wait.

11:13.768 --> 11:14.935
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- We'll just--

11:14.970 --> 11:15.936
- Give us a second.
- Here we go, here we go.

11:15.971 --> 11:17.271
No, no, hold on.
Hold on.

11:17.305 --> 11:19.006
You're not seriously
considering this, are you?

11:19.024 --> 11:20.173
Yes, I am.

11:20.192 --> 11:22.393
She holds the key
to the lost artifact.

11:22.444 --> 11:24.395
Those artifacts
have stayed lost for 100 years.

11:24.446 --> 11:25.563
I know.

11:25.614 --> 11:26.864
They will keep
for another 100.

11:26.898 --> 11:28.399
No, no, you don't understand.
Listen--

11:28.450 --> 11:31.402
Listen to me.
This woman is clearly a liar.

11:31.453 --> 11:32.853
Listen, there is a reason

11:32.871 --> 11:34.572
that she has dragged us here
to Buffalo.

11:34.623 --> 11:36.857
I'm telling you,
the wings are legendary.

11:36.875 --> 11:38.125
Put some ranch dressing
on 'em--

11:38.159 --> 11:39.126
Will you--

11:39.160 --> 11:41.412
Hey...Just--
just stay cool.

11:41.463 --> 11:43.414
Listen to me.

11:43.465 --> 11:46.417
Roaring Dan targeted chips
from the Atlantic

11:46.468 --> 11:48.252
to the Great Lakes.

11:48.303 --> 11:50.421
And Charlotte
must have evidence

11:50.472 --> 11:52.756
that his stash is somewhere
in this region.

11:52.807 --> 11:54.425
We cannot risk her finding
the artifacts

11:54.476 --> 11:56.209
without us there.

11:56.228 --> 11:57.428
Keep your enemies closer.

11:57.479 --> 11:59.597
[Sighs] Yes.
And don't worry...

11:59.648 --> 12:01.715
She won't be with us
for very long.

12:05.403 --> 12:07.321
All right, Ms. Dupres.

12:08.490 --> 12:09.556
Partners.

12:18.412 --> 12:21.146
So... where were we?

12:21.193 --> 12:23.661
We were partners.
Where the hell have you been?

12:25.197 --> 12:28.044
Well, Artie wouldn't stop
at a single Denny's.

12:31.536 --> 12:32.536
[Laughing]

12:32.587 --> 12:35.589
You have it everywhere.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.157
[Chuckles]

12:37.175 --> 12:40.711
Ah, what would I do
without you?

12:40.762 --> 12:43.597
Okay, wait a minute.
There's that look again.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.332
Myka, what's--
what's wrong?

12:45.350 --> 12:49.670
On my physical,
the doctor found something.

12:49.688 --> 12:53.024
I have cancer.

12:53.058 --> 12:54.675
No!

12:54.693 --> 12:57.010
Myka, Myka, Myka,
Myka, Myka.

12:57.029 --> 12:58.863
[Laughs]
Earth to Myka.

12:58.897 --> 13:00.731
Why do you keep
zoning out on me?

13:00.782 --> 13:02.182
What is with you today?

13:02.200 --> 13:04.118
Nothing. No.

13:04.152 --> 13:05.286
There's--
there's nothing wrong.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.955
Let's just stay focused
on the mission.

13:07.989 --> 13:09.907
No, not until
you tell me what's wrong.

13:09.958 --> 13:11.075
Pete, just forget it,
okay?

13:11.126 --> 13:13.244
Pete... Myka,
come here and look at this.

13:13.295 --> 13:14.245
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

13:14.296 --> 13:16.697
Look at this.

13:16.715 --> 13:18.299
[Laughs]

13:18.333 --> 13:20.134
I gotta say,
I'm very excited.

13:23.388 --> 13:28.709
[Mechanical whirring]

13:28.727 --> 13:31.211
What the hell?
What is that, the...

13:31.229 --> 13:33.314
Combination
to Davy Jones' locker?

13:33.348 --> 13:34.932
No, I think it's, uh...

13:34.983 --> 13:37.601
longitude and latitude.
They're coordinates.

13:37.652 --> 13:41.238
[Whirring and clicking]

13:43.575 --> 13:45.726
[Clicking]

13:45.744 --> 13:47.912
No. No!

13:47.946 --> 13:50.948
So, what, is this puzzle box
a one-shot deal?

13:50.999 --> 13:53.834
Wait a minute.
Tell me you got it.

13:53.869 --> 13:54.919
You have to ask?

13:54.953 --> 13:57.237
[Thunder rumbling]

13:57.255 --> 14:01.008
Okay, this is about
as specific as it gets.

14:01.042 --> 14:03.961
It's somewhere within
100 yards of here.

14:04.012 --> 14:05.463
Looks like somebody
was a bit too literal

14:05.514 --> 14:08.015
about taking his secrets
to the grave.

14:08.049 --> 14:10.184
It's a good place to hide
a lifetime of plunder.

14:10.218 --> 14:12.269
All right, we're gonna cover
more ground if we split up.

14:12.304 --> 14:13.971
Charlotte,
you two go that way

14:14.022 --> 14:15.422
and just shout
if you find anything.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.974
- You do the same.
- All right.

14:17.025 --> 14:18.592
- Hey, Artie.
- Yeah?

14:18.610 --> 14:20.311
We're not gonna have to dig up
any dead bodies, are we?

14:20.362 --> 14:23.280
'Cause I promise you, it only
looks cool in the movies.

14:23.315 --> 14:27.034
Yeah. Dan put the coordinates
in the puzzle box for a reason.

14:27.068 --> 14:28.602
There's gotta be
something here.

14:28.620 --> 14:30.454
All right, Pete,
you check that way.

14:30.489 --> 14:31.872
Yeah.

14:33.074 --> 14:35.993
[Thunder rumbling]

14:36.044 --> 14:37.110
Artie...

14:37.129 --> 14:38.379
What?

14:38.413 --> 14:39.964
Jonathan P. Tann.

14:39.998 --> 14:42.500
That was the name of his
first mate, right?

14:42.551 --> 14:43.968
- Yeah.
- Seaman.

14:44.002 --> 14:45.118
Yeah. Mm, please.

14:45.137 --> 14:47.388
His headstone,
it's not made of stone.

14:47.422 --> 14:50.391
No, this
is molded concrete.

14:50.425 --> 14:52.593
A more secure puzzle box,
perhaps.

14:52.627 --> 14:55.312
Auguste Rodin's
sculpting tools.

14:55.347 --> 14:57.398
They have the power
to reveal shapes

14:57.432 --> 14:58.516
hidden inside objects.

14:58.567 --> 15:00.568
Hey, how come that bag
always has exactly--

15:00.602 --> 15:03.437
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
You'll jinx it.

15:11.112 --> 15:13.080
Well, that doesn't
look like a treasure.

15:13.114 --> 15:15.199
Looks like
an electric meter.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.535
"N-F-P-C"--

15:17.586 --> 15:18.836
Shh.

15:18.870 --> 15:21.088
First, we have
to lose Charlotte

15:21.122 --> 15:22.122
and the giant.

15:22.156 --> 15:23.507
And then--
[Electricity buzzing]

15:23.542 --> 15:25.125
Aagh!

15:25.159 --> 15:26.177
What the hell?

15:26.211 --> 15:27.795
[Buzzing]
Aah!

15:27.829 --> 15:28.796
Uhh!

15:28.830 --> 15:31.265
I knew I couldn't trust you.

15:31.299 --> 15:34.552
Thank you, Lars,
and thank you, Warehouse 13.

15:41.726 --> 15:44.728
Hey. Okay.
So which would you prefer,

15:44.779 --> 15:46.280
Sandy beaches
or rocky mountains?

15:46.314 --> 15:48.866
Because I just found
two kick-ass youth shelters

15:48.900 --> 15:50.451
- in Miami and--
- Whatever.

15:50.485 --> 15:53.070
The sooner I get away
from your partner, the better.

15:53.121 --> 15:54.872
What?

15:54.906 --> 15:56.740
Why? What happened?

15:56.791 --> 15:59.627
Steve and I just got into it
something fierce.

15:59.661 --> 16:01.078
That seems...

16:01.129 --> 16:02.713
God, he said he'd be cool.

16:02.747 --> 16:04.381
Well, I guess not.

16:04.416 --> 16:05.799
And no matter what I say,

16:05.834 --> 16:07.301
that guy's never
gonna believe me.

16:07.335 --> 16:09.386
Hey...
[Scoffs]

16:09.421 --> 16:11.055
Let me handle him, okay?

16:11.089 --> 16:12.139
Come here.

16:15.310 --> 16:18.145
[All grunting]

16:19.314 --> 16:21.765
Well, that was shocking.

16:21.816 --> 16:24.151
Duplicitous minx!

16:24.185 --> 16:26.270
She double-crossed
my double-cross.

16:26.321 --> 16:28.188
Look, we know
where she went, though, right?

16:28.222 --> 16:30.724
I mean, uh, NFPC.

16:30.742 --> 16:32.576
Niagara Falls
Power Company.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.565
Construction began
in 1897,

16:38.583 --> 16:41.118
the same period that Roaring Dan
was active in this area.

16:41.169 --> 16:43.504
I think his stash has gotta be
be buried under here.

16:43.538 --> 16:47.124
Ah, an uber-rich loner
with a secret underground lair.

16:47.175 --> 16:49.793
Right? Like who is this guy,
Spider-Man?

16:49.844 --> 16:51.679
What? Oh, my God, no!

16:51.713 --> 16:54.598
Spider-Man lives in Queens
with his aunt. Batman--

16:54.633 --> 16:57.301
Pete, moderate your Comic-Con
panel later!

16:57.352 --> 17:00.638
- What's Comic-Con?
- [Whimpers]

17:03.975 --> 17:05.976
Whoa.

17:06.027 --> 17:07.426
You know what I think?

17:07.444 --> 17:10.364
Nikola Tesla designed
a lot of this.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.031
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah?

17:12.067 --> 17:13.450
These--these meter
thingies.

17:13.484 --> 17:15.819
They look just like the one
that was in that headstone.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.320
You know what?
You're right.

17:17.372 --> 17:19.271
And I'll bet one of these
is the key to Dan's hideout.

17:19.290 --> 17:23.777
Guys, I think Charlotte
already found it.

17:23.795 --> 17:26.497
Wonder if...

17:26.548 --> 17:29.616
[Strange whining sound]

17:29.634 --> 17:32.169
[Clang]

17:32.220 --> 17:35.122
- [Gasps]
- Avast, me hearties.

17:35.140 --> 17:38.125
Let's go snag us
some arr-tifacts.

17:38.143 --> 17:39.727
Yes, indeed.

17:41.146 --> 17:42.813
[Laughs]

17:42.847 --> 17:44.848
Yeah, just tell him that
Steve Jinks called. Thanks.

17:44.899 --> 17:47.568
Hey... I was just about
to come looking for you.

17:47.602 --> 17:49.186
- What's up?
- You know, I think you and I

17:49.237 --> 17:51.188
need to have some serious
words about Nick.

17:51.239 --> 17:53.190
Sure, but...

17:53.241 --> 17:55.025
Is that alarm
coming from your computer?

17:55.076 --> 17:57.411
That sounds like the intruder
alert you told me you set up.

17:57.445 --> 18:01.148
[Faint pinging]

18:01.166 --> 18:02.950
We gotta get
to the Warehouse.

18:05.587 --> 18:07.338
If Charlotte got here
ahead of us,

18:07.372 --> 18:10.924
she could have already found
the Warehouse 12 crates.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.711
Artie, relax.
She'd probably just mistake 'em

18:13.762 --> 18:17.664
- for a bunch of junk and--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:17.682 --> 18:19.550
It's Lars.

18:21.686 --> 18:23.887
He's dead.

18:23.938 --> 18:26.023
That never happens
at Comic-Con.

18:32.383 --> 18:35.015
I'm no doctor, but I'm--
I'm pretty sure

18:35.054 --> 18:37.388
the human head is not
supposed to twist like that.

18:37.439 --> 18:38.473
His neck is broken.

18:38.507 --> 18:39.857
Well, given
the unnatural angle,

18:39.892 --> 18:42.226
I would say his neck
was forcibly snapped.

18:42.277 --> 18:44.228
He must have died instantly.

18:44.279 --> 18:47.198
You know, I think that...

18:47.232 --> 18:48.682
Myka, what's wrong?

18:48.701 --> 18:51.202
What? Nothing's wrong!

18:52.738 --> 18:56.240
Look, just judging
by the dagger in his hand,

18:56.291 --> 18:57.408
I mean,
he and Charlotte must have

18:57.459 --> 18:58.910
turned on one another,
right?

18:58.961 --> 19:00.128
There's no blood
on the dagger.

19:00.162 --> 19:01.245
He never got a chance
to use it.

19:01.296 --> 19:02.714
[Chuckles]
Okay, wait, I'm sorry.

19:02.748 --> 19:04.865
All right, are we saying
that Charlotte

19:04.883 --> 19:07.585
took out a guy over a foot
taller than she is?

19:07.636 --> 19:08.836
Well, look at
his body position.

19:08.870 --> 19:11.255
He was obviously running
up the stairs to get out.

19:11.306 --> 19:12.390
Maybe--what, maybe Charlotte

19:12.424 --> 19:14.041
found an artifact
and used it on him?

19:14.059 --> 19:16.260
All the more reason
for us to snag and bag him

19:16.311 --> 19:19.230
before she uses an artifact
on us.

19:22.818 --> 19:24.885
Who else could the intruder
possibly be if not Nick?

19:24.903 --> 19:26.887
I don't know, can you wait
until we get in there

19:26.905 --> 19:28.072
before you start
pointing fingers?

19:28.107 --> 19:29.490
Okay, when was the last time
you saw him?

19:29.525 --> 19:31.409
Oh, my God, Nick knows nothing
about the Warehouse, okay?

19:31.443 --> 19:32.577
Also, I've got this place
locked down

19:32.611 --> 19:34.228
tighter than
Mrs. Frederic's weave.

19:34.246 --> 19:36.897
Only person who gets past
my security protocols is me.

19:36.915 --> 19:38.082
Okay, but if he could,

19:38.117 --> 19:39.450
what would he have to do first
to break in,

19:39.501 --> 19:41.169
cut the power to Artie's office
or something?

19:41.203 --> 19:44.288
Well, yeah.
I mean, technically...

19:44.339 --> 19:46.591
Yeah. But if the lights
are on out here,

19:46.625 --> 19:50.244
chances are
they're still gonna be on in...

19:51.597 --> 19:52.930
This proves nothing.

19:52.965 --> 19:55.133
There's gotta be
a glitch somewhere.

19:58.604 --> 20:01.389
Freaky.
Everything looks normal.

20:01.423 --> 20:03.365
Let there be light.

20:04.630 --> 20:05.994
Can you tell
if there's anyone out there?

20:06.037 --> 20:07.595
If there's anything I can't
do, I'll let you know.

20:07.613 --> 20:09.597
FYI, there's not.
[Typing]

20:09.615 --> 20:11.816
- Thermal imaging.
- Yeah, okay, that blue spot

20:11.867 --> 20:13.767
is the Dark Vault,
a breezy 66 degrees.

20:13.786 --> 20:15.036
All good there.

20:15.070 --> 20:16.937
That red zone,
the Lehmann Fornax,

20:16.955 --> 20:18.406
- a balmy 120.
- There.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.074
Oh, the Bronze Sector?

20:20.108 --> 20:21.793
Yeah, since everyone there
is technically still alive,

20:21.827 --> 20:23.377
they radiate faint
traces of heat.

20:23.412 --> 20:24.879
Right.

20:24.913 --> 20:26.247
Where are you going?

20:26.281 --> 20:27.748
Well, to check
the Bronze Sector.

20:27.782 --> 20:29.217
With all those
heat signatures in flux,

20:29.251 --> 20:30.885
- it's a perfect hiding spot.
- I'm going with you.

20:30.919 --> 20:32.003
No! No, no, no.
No, no.

20:32.054 --> 20:33.754
I need your eyes up here
watching my back.

20:33.788 --> 20:35.840
Just give me a shout if you
see anybody coming my way.

20:35.891 --> 20:36.974
Uh...

20:37.009 --> 20:38.392
Seriously doubt it.

20:38.427 --> 20:40.561
But take this.

20:43.632 --> 20:45.183
This is nuts.

20:45.234 --> 20:47.485
Artie, you have to wait
until we can clear the room!

20:47.519 --> 20:48.986
Don't worry.
We're fine.

20:49.021 --> 20:51.489
Nothing is gonna
kill you, Myka.

20:51.523 --> 20:53.407
I know what you're thinking.

20:53.442 --> 20:54.909
You do?

20:54.943 --> 20:57.695
Yeah, Charlotte whacked
Lars so she could keep

20:57.746 --> 21:00.281
all of Roaring Dan's loot
for herself.

21:00.315 --> 21:03.284
Yeah, you read my mind.

21:03.318 --> 21:05.086
Guys, come here.
Look at this.

21:07.289 --> 21:11.342
[Hinges squeak]

21:11.376 --> 21:13.711
Ah.

21:14.829 --> 21:17.048
[Chuckles]

21:17.099 --> 21:19.133
Well, shiver me timbers.

21:19.167 --> 21:20.434
Look at this.

21:20.469 --> 21:23.604
It looks like Dan
tried to replicate

21:23.639 --> 21:26.224
the interior of his ship,
the <i>Wanderer.</i>

21:26.275 --> 21:28.359
Doesn't look like
Charlotte's been here yet.

21:28.393 --> 21:29.560
[Whimpers]

21:29.611 --> 21:30.862
Well...

21:30.896 --> 21:32.730
Let's hope.

21:32.781 --> 21:34.482
Think Dan lived here?

21:34.516 --> 21:36.450
Most historians say he died
in 1949,

21:36.485 --> 21:40.037
but the truth is he fell
off the map decades earlier.

21:40.072 --> 21:42.240
Guys!

21:42.291 --> 21:44.542
Check out Bonesy McDead
over here!

21:47.412 --> 21:50.047
Roaring Dan Seavey,
I'd imagine.

21:50.082 --> 21:51.499
Oh, it's him all right.
Take a look at this.

21:51.533 --> 21:52.917
During the raid
on the ship <i>Avalon,</i>

21:52.968 --> 21:55.253
it's said he lost
a couple of fingers.

21:55.304 --> 21:57.805
And scored
some serious bling in--

21:57.839 --> 22:00.841
We're here for artifacts,
not treasure.

22:00.875 --> 22:02.843
Look around.

22:02.877 --> 22:05.012
You know what?
There's no point

22:05.046 --> 22:06.397
in the three of us
searching the same room.

22:06.431 --> 22:08.316
I'm gonna check out
the hall.

22:08.350 --> 22:09.567
[Sighs]

22:09.601 --> 22:10.851
[Phone ringing]

22:10.885 --> 22:12.853
Hey, I'm running
a diagnostic

22:12.887 --> 22:14.021
on the Warehouse systems
and--

22:14.055 --> 22:15.740
Claudia, check
the thermal imaging.

22:15.774 --> 22:17.074
In Caretto-0101.

22:17.109 --> 22:18.409
I think there's
somebody behind me--hurry.

22:18.443 --> 22:20.778
Checking right now.

22:20.829 --> 22:22.914
Oh, my God, Jinksy,
watch your six.

22:22.948 --> 22:23.915
Oh, my God.

22:23.949 --> 22:25.416
Oh, my God, no.

22:25.450 --> 22:27.568
- Steve, what is it?
- Claudia, go.

22:27.586 --> 22:29.203
Get the hell
out of the Warehouse, now!

22:29.237 --> 22:30.755
What? Why?
What's...

22:30.789 --> 22:32.924
You're dead.

22:32.958 --> 22:34.091
She killed you!

22:34.126 --> 22:36.010
[Crash over phone]

22:36.044 --> 22:38.262
Steve!

22:38.297 --> 22:39.847
Jinksy!

22:39.881 --> 22:42.300
Jinksy!

22:42.351 --> 22:44.051
Aah!

22:46.305 --> 22:47.271
Marcus.

22:47.306 --> 22:49.140
You remember me.

22:49.191 --> 22:50.608
That's good.

22:50.642 --> 22:52.610
No.

22:52.644 --> 22:53.811
No. Uhh!

22:56.097 --> 22:57.782
Children shouldn't
play with guns.

23:03.238 --> 23:04.938
[Clank]

23:09.494 --> 23:11.746
[Both grunting]

23:11.780 --> 23:13.381
[Clatter]

23:19.388 --> 23:20.805
- Uhh!
- Ohh!

23:20.839 --> 23:22.256
How'd you kill
your bodyguard?

23:22.290 --> 23:23.591
I didn't.
We were attacked!

23:23.625 --> 23:24.842
- By whom?
- I don't know!

23:24.893 --> 23:27.645
But we're not the only ones
down here!

23:27.679 --> 23:29.313
[Panting]

23:29.348 --> 23:31.482
If Roaring Dan actually
tried to replicate

23:31.516 --> 23:33.901
the original cabin,
these captains, they--

23:33.935 --> 23:36.320
they often had escape hatches
down to the cargo hold

23:36.355 --> 23:37.989
so that if their ship
was under attack,

23:38.023 --> 23:39.490
they could go down there,
grab their plunder,

23:39.524 --> 23:40.641
and get the hell out.

23:40.659 --> 23:42.076
So we look
for a hidden passage.

23:42.110 --> 23:44.111
I love hidden passages!

23:47.499 --> 23:49.533
This...

23:49.584 --> 23:52.837
That could have
a false bottom...

23:52.871 --> 23:56.257
and hide a passageway.

23:56.291 --> 23:57.508
Whoo hoo hoo!

23:57.542 --> 23:59.543
Man, my timbers
are shiverin'.

23:59.594 --> 24:01.178
Did it just
get cold in here?

24:01.213 --> 24:03.097
Ah, what's that?

24:03.131 --> 24:04.882
What the--ohh!
Agh! Oh!

24:04.933 --> 24:06.667
[Grunting]
Holy crap!

24:06.685 --> 24:10.354
[Artie grunting]

24:10.389 --> 24:11.856
Artie!

24:11.890 --> 24:14.275
[Zapping]

24:14.309 --> 24:15.526
Uhh!

24:15.560 --> 24:16.527
Uhh!

24:16.561 --> 24:19.230
[Grunting and gagging]

24:21.733 --> 24:23.422

24:35.803 --> 24:37.471
Uhh!

24:40.391 --> 24:42.859
It's the noise.
The noise, Artie, the noise!

24:42.894 --> 24:45.729
The noise is its kryptonite.
Make noise!

24:45.763 --> 24:47.981
[Banging]
Aah! Aah!

24:48.015 --> 24:49.816
[Bell clanging]
Aah!

24:49.851 --> 24:52.319
Aah! Aah!

24:52.353 --> 24:53.737
Aah!

24:53.771 --> 24:56.690

24:56.741 --> 24:58.658
[Roars]

24:58.693 --> 25:00.527

25:00.578 --> 25:02.645
Artie, Artie, Artie,
Artie, Artie.

25:02.663 --> 25:04.314
- [Coughing]
- Are you all right?

25:04.332 --> 25:05.365
- [Strained] Yeah.
- Are you all right?

25:05.416 --> 25:06.983
Think so.

25:07.001 --> 25:08.418
What the hell was that?

25:08.452 --> 25:11.988
I don't know.
[Buzzing]

25:12.006 --> 25:13.507
Artie, listen.
I found Charlotte.

25:13.541 --> 25:16.009
She claims--get this--
that some sort of smoke monster

25:16.043 --> 25:17.327
killed her bodyguard.

25:17.345 --> 25:19.713
Yeah, it just tried
to kill me too.

25:19.764 --> 25:21.431
I know, right?
She's--

25:21.465 --> 25:22.849
Wait, what?

25:22.884 --> 25:24.551
I'll explain later.
Just get here now.

25:24.602 --> 25:25.602
Hurry!

25:27.104 --> 25:29.439
[Whimpers]

25:29.473 --> 25:31.641
Ah! 20 miles
of Warehouse,

25:31.675 --> 25:34.027
I find the one dead end.

25:34.061 --> 25:35.195
- Oh...
- [Gasps]

25:35.229 --> 25:36.512
Wrong turn.

25:36.531 --> 25:39.015
I killed you.
You can't be here.

25:39.033 --> 25:40.534
Yet here I am.

25:40.568 --> 25:41.952
What did you do with Steve?

25:41.986 --> 25:43.620
Oh, I replaced
his ghostly pallor

25:43.654 --> 25:45.572
with a nice bronze glow.

25:45.623 --> 25:47.190
You bronzed him?
Why?

25:47.208 --> 25:48.858
What the hell do you want?

25:48.876 --> 25:51.194
[Buzzing]

25:51.212 --> 25:52.746
[Chuckles]

25:52.797 --> 25:54.364
Nice try.

â™ª Should auld acquaintance be â™ª

26:01.923 --> 26:04.007
No, the dagger
wasn't a weapon.

26:04.041 --> 26:05.375
It was treasure
that he picked up.

26:05.393 --> 26:06.760
Exactly--treasure.

26:06.811 --> 26:08.845
Exactly the same as when
I moved these coins.

26:08.879 --> 26:10.764
- That's when it came again.
- No, it was like

26:10.815 --> 26:12.048
- a really angry shadow.
- Exactly.

26:12.066 --> 26:13.817
A shadow
that protects treasure.

26:13.851 --> 26:15.986
Doesn't that seem, I don't know,
strange to you?

26:16.020 --> 26:17.988
- Nuh-uh.
- Uh-uh. Seen stranger.

26:18.022 --> 26:19.606
- Not really.
- I've seen stranger.

26:19.657 --> 26:20.857
- Artie!
- Yeah?

26:20.891 --> 26:22.558
That thing, it went down
under the carpet,

26:22.577 --> 26:24.611
into the floor, now...

26:24.662 --> 26:27.998
If its job is to guard
Dan's stash...

26:28.032 --> 26:30.083
Then there--
there could be a hatch...

26:30.117 --> 26:32.669
Yeah.

26:32.703 --> 26:34.337
[Laughs]

26:34.372 --> 26:35.622
Okay, we can...

26:35.673 --> 26:37.290
[Grunting]

26:37.341 --> 26:38.592
Okay, you know what?

26:38.626 --> 26:39.909
There's gotta be some kind
of mechanism

26:39.927 --> 26:41.294
that unlocks this thing.

26:41.345 --> 26:43.746
Go, look for a switch!

26:43.764 --> 26:44.747
Hey, guys...

26:44.765 --> 26:45.849
Check it out.

26:45.883 --> 26:48.518
Look alive, ye scurvy dogs!

26:48.552 --> 26:50.270
There be stormy seas ahead!

26:50.304 --> 26:51.421
Why do you always
have to--

26:51.439 --> 26:52.772
Aah aah!

26:52.807 --> 26:54.090
[Crashing]
Uhh!

26:56.694 --> 26:58.094
Found the switch.

26:58.112 --> 26:59.863
[Groans]

27:03.901 --> 27:06.602
Hang on, Jinksy.

27:06.621 --> 27:09.623

Artie and his stupid

27:33.648 --> 27:36.900
Oh, I'm fine.

27:41.939 --> 27:44.491
This is it.
Dan's fortune.

27:44.525 --> 27:46.526
Oh, my God, Artie.
You did it!

27:46.577 --> 27:48.028
- We found it!
- No, we--we did it!

27:48.079 --> 27:50.530
Finally the Warehouse 12

27:50.581 --> 27:51.531
missing artifacts.

27:51.582 --> 27:52.866
We--wait, first...

27:52.917 --> 27:54.868
First, we have to find
the artifact

27:54.919 --> 27:56.703
that is causing that smoke thing
killer to come--

27:56.754 --> 27:59.539
Right, and bag it before tall,
dark, and neck-snappy shows up.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.324
- Copy that.
- Okay, Artie,

28:01.342 --> 28:03.259
how are we supposed to find
the artifact

28:03.294 --> 28:05.095
that's causing this
if we're not supposed

28:05.129 --> 28:06.329
- to touch anything?
- No, I know.

28:06.347 --> 28:07.380
Look at the outside
of the crates.

28:07.431 --> 28:08.598
They all have--
they all have, look.

28:08.632 --> 28:10.350
They have manifests.
Just check those out.

28:10.384 --> 28:12.719
Maybe one of them
will have a clue.

28:12.770 --> 28:14.170
I'm not seeing anything
that says

28:14.188 --> 28:16.856
"causes murderous smoke monster"
on any of these labels.

28:16.891 --> 28:18.341
How about you, Myks?

28:18.359 --> 28:20.944
Me, neither, but, look--
it's gotta be here somewhere.

28:20.978 --> 28:22.228
So just keep looking.

28:24.148 --> 28:25.565
What the hell
are you doing?

28:25.616 --> 28:27.850
- I didn't do anything?
- Uh, her.

28:27.868 --> 28:29.703
Oh... nothing.

28:29.737 --> 28:31.187
Just checking my emails.

28:31.205 --> 28:33.239
This was never
about Dan's treasure.

28:33.290 --> 28:34.857
Was it, Charlotte?

28:34.875 --> 28:37.043
This has always been
about the artifacts.

28:37.078 --> 28:38.861
Artifacts?
What artifacts?

28:38.879 --> 28:40.880
The artifacts that you knew
somehow were down here

28:40.915 --> 28:43.333
- that you used us to find!
- What are you talking about?

28:43.367 --> 28:44.534
I was only ever here
for the--

28:44.552 --> 28:45.535
All: No, no, no!

28:45.553 --> 28:48.037
[Roaring]

28:48.055 --> 28:49.372
No, no, no!

28:49.390 --> 28:50.757
[Overlapping shouts]

28:50.808 --> 28:52.225
Make noise!
Make noise!

28:52.259 --> 28:53.760
That's what's
gonna scare it!

28:53.811 --> 28:56.546
Make noise!
Aah!

28:56.564 --> 29:01.434
[All banging and shouting]

29:01.485 --> 29:03.052
It's not working!

29:03.070 --> 29:04.604
Aah!

29:04.655 --> 29:06.272
[All shouting]

29:14.115 --> 29:17.083
- Oh, my God, she's--
- Dead.

29:24.086 --> 29:25.702
So I take it back.

29:25.721 --> 29:29.006
Being killed by a pirate
is a crappy way to die.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.541
Really?

29:30.559 --> 29:33.060
Is there a good way?

29:35.647 --> 29:37.214
- What's with her?
- I don't know.

29:37.232 --> 29:39.316
Something's...

29:39.351 --> 29:41.769
So I guess sound
isn't what chased off

29:41.820 --> 29:44.271
Old Slim Shady after all,
but what made him run?

29:44.322 --> 29:47.074
I don't know, I think it's
maybe just a question of pitch.

29:47.109 --> 29:48.892
Of maybe it's the composition
of the brass.

29:48.910 --> 29:51.278
- I think we need the bell.
- What the hell was that, Artie?

29:51.329 --> 29:53.230
Smoke? I don't know.
But from everything I've seen,

29:53.248 --> 29:56.083
I think it's some kind
of psychic extension

29:56.118 --> 29:57.501
or projection.

29:57.536 --> 29:58.502
Projection of who?

29:58.537 --> 30:00.287
Roaring Dan Seavey.

30:00.338 --> 30:03.841
When that smoke monster thing
was choking Charlotte,

30:03.875 --> 30:07.278
I noticed that it only
had three fingers on one hand,

30:07.312 --> 30:09.263
just like
the skeleton upstairs.

30:09.297 --> 30:11.599
So even from the grave,

30:11.633 --> 30:14.268
Dan's keeping an eye
on his booty.

30:14.302 --> 30:16.187
Now all we need to do
is find out

30:16.221 --> 30:17.638
what artifact he used.

30:17.689 --> 30:19.640
All right, let's just
keep looking at the manifest.

30:19.691 --> 30:21.192
And--carefully!

30:21.226 --> 30:25.929
Because we don't want
to touch anything.

30:25.947 --> 30:28.949
I got Thaddeus Cahill's
telharmonium keyboard,

30:28.984 --> 30:31.702
which causes synesthesia.
No.

30:31.736 --> 30:35.206
Uh, Robert the Bruce's tartan
inspires unyielding defiance.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.658
Guys... this box is empty.

30:37.709 --> 30:39.960
What?

30:39.995 --> 30:43.464
Uh, one jewel-studded
unicursal hexagram amulet

30:43.498 --> 30:44.799
belonging to Aleister Crowley.

30:44.833 --> 30:47.117
Aleister Crowley?
The guy from the Ozzy song?

30:47.135 --> 30:48.636
Yes. Yes,
you're right, actually.

30:48.670 --> 30:51.222
Aleister Crowley.
He was a notorious occultist

30:51.256 --> 30:53.340
who spent much of his life
studying and mastering the art

30:53.391 --> 30:55.559
or astral projection,

30:55.594 --> 30:57.344
which he considered essential
in the quest

30:57.395 --> 31:00.147
for the discovery
of one's true will.

31:00.182 --> 31:02.066
So Dan's one true will

31:02.100 --> 31:04.318
is protecting his treasure
after his death.

31:04.352 --> 31:07.354
And--and he was
a frustrated tenor

31:07.405 --> 31:08.355
who could never
hit high "C"!

31:08.406 --> 31:09.806
- What?
- The bell.

31:09.825 --> 31:11.075
That was a perfect high "C."

31:11.109 --> 31:12.476
Oh, come on,
tell me you could hear that.

31:12.494 --> 31:14.495
- What bell?
- All right, so--so--so--

31:14.529 --> 31:17.581
Crowley's amulet allowed our
favorite pirate to project,

31:17.616 --> 31:18.699
but where is it?

31:18.750 --> 31:20.251
[Muttering]
It was an amulet

31:20.285 --> 31:21.485
that was a hexagram.

31:21.503 --> 31:24.338
A hexagram
is a six-pointed star, so...

31:24.372 --> 31:26.257
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

31:26.291 --> 31:29.710
In the skeleton's hand upstairs
there was a hexagram!

31:31.129 --> 31:32.263
You know how a ladder
works, right?

31:32.297 --> 31:33.997
Yes.

31:34.015 --> 31:38.185
[Electronic beeping]

31:38.220 --> 31:40.337
There is no limit
to my genius.

31:40.355 --> 31:42.356
Yes.

31:42.390 --> 31:45.059
Ahh.

31:45.110 --> 31:46.277
What the...

31:46.311 --> 31:48.729
Hello,
unusual and out of place.

31:48.780 --> 31:50.847
What...

31:50.866 --> 31:52.650
Come here.

31:56.738 --> 31:58.989
Can you just tell him
that Steve Jinks called?

31:59.023 --> 32:01.119
Hey, I was just about to
come looking for you.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.767
Is that alarm coming
from your computer?

32:02.814 --> 32:04.564
It sounds like the intruder
alert you told me you set up.

32:04.599 --> 32:05.766
Okay, but if he could,

32:05.800 --> 32:07.084
what would he have to do first
to break in,

32:07.125 --> 32:08.809
cut the power
to Artie's office or something?

32:08.852 --> 32:10.736
Technically, yeah.

32:11.098 --> 32:12.697
You know, but if the lights
are on out here,

32:12.733 --> 32:14.955
chances are
they're still on in there.

32:15.447 --> 32:17.239
Since everyone there
is technically still alive,

32:17.265 --> 32:18.682
they all radiate
faint traces of heat.

32:18.716 --> 32:20.083
With all those
heat signatures in flux,

32:20.101 --> 32:21.918
it's a perfect hiding spot.

32:27.475 --> 32:28.475
Uhh!

32:28.526 --> 32:29.643
[Panting]

32:29.694 --> 32:31.945
Well, Jinksy,

32:31.980 --> 32:33.614
it turns out
you were r--

32:36.701 --> 32:38.118
Who the hell are you?

32:38.153 --> 32:40.654
[Buzzer]

32:40.705 --> 32:42.289
Jinksy, thank God
you're still there.

32:42.323 --> 32:44.658
Uh, where else
would I be?

32:44.709 --> 32:46.109
I gotta get these
mission logs done

32:46.127 --> 32:47.377
before Artie gets back.

32:47.412 --> 32:48.662
Yeah, I knew that we
were backlogged,

32:48.713 --> 32:50.330
but this is gonna
take weeks.

32:53.084 --> 32:54.451
Oh, yeah,
you've been whammied too.

32:54.469 --> 32:56.119
Check your pockets.

32:56.137 --> 32:57.805
Okay.

33:01.676 --> 33:03.060
What's this?

33:03.094 --> 33:05.179
Just bag it.
Hurry!

33:09.350 --> 33:10.767
[Whoosh]

33:13.238 --> 33:14.822
Uh...

33:14.856 --> 33:17.474
Claud, are you gonna
fill me in?

33:17.492 --> 33:19.142
Franz Mesmer's magnets.

33:19.160 --> 33:22.312
They create illusion through
the power of suggestion.

33:22.330 --> 33:24.081
I'll give you one guess
who slipped them to us.

33:24.115 --> 33:25.482
Nick?

33:25.500 --> 33:26.583
Oh, thanks,
but I got paperwork.

33:26.618 --> 33:28.502
Looks like mountains of it.

33:28.536 --> 33:30.921
[Echoing]
Looks like mountains of it.

33:30.955 --> 33:33.707
Yep.

33:33.758 --> 33:37.094
He used them to make me think
that he was you.

33:37.128 --> 33:39.546
And then he used...
me, Steve!

33:39.597 --> 33:41.932
I-I trusted him!
I let him into our home,

33:41.966 --> 33:43.717
and you--
I mean, you warned me!

33:43.768 --> 33:44.801
God, but I just--

33:44.835 --> 33:46.002
You did what you thought
was right.

33:46.020 --> 33:47.304
Yeah, well,
now that little pissant's

33:47.338 --> 33:48.889
loose in the Warehouse.

33:48.940 --> 33:50.524
- What's he after?
- Uh--uh--

33:50.558 --> 33:53.560
a Bronze Sector prisoner,
some geezer named...

33:53.611 --> 33:54.895
[Buzzing]

33:54.946 --> 33:56.780
[British accent]
Spoilers.

33:56.814 --> 33:58.565
Claudia!

34:00.201 --> 34:01.351
Don't!

34:03.538 --> 34:05.539
How long have you
known about the Warehouse?

34:05.573 --> 34:08.958
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

34:08.993 --> 34:12.295
I am way past
believing anything

34:12.330 --> 34:13.697
you have to say.

34:13.715 --> 34:16.750
Look, I wish that I didn't
have to lie to you.

34:16.801 --> 34:18.201
But you'll understand later.

34:18.219 --> 34:21.036
You're making
a big mistake, Nick!

34:21.054 --> 34:23.039
I mean, there's a reason
that guy was bronzed,

34:23.056 --> 34:24.541
whoever he is--
he's dangerous!

34:24.559 --> 34:26.560
I know!

34:26.594 --> 34:28.512
But I need him!

34:31.315 --> 34:34.050
[Beeping]

34:41.242 --> 34:43.243
I'm sorry, Claudia.

34:45.780 --> 34:48.231
[Beeping]

34:48.248 --> 34:50.918
[Rapid beeping]

34:50.952 --> 34:54.955
[Machine humming]

34:55.005 --> 34:56.672
[Buzzer]

35:10.355 --> 35:12.022
[Speaking German]

35:12.056 --> 35:13.807
[Speaking German]

35:53.014 --> 35:54.848
Okay, okay,
now, listen.

35:54.899 --> 35:56.850
Soon as I touch
this amulet,

35:56.901 --> 35:58.352
Pete, bell.

35:58.403 --> 35:59.469
Myka, bag.
You got it?

35:59.487 --> 36:01.104
- Ready.
- Okay.

36:03.441 --> 36:04.408
Bag! Myka!

36:04.442 --> 36:06.827
Aagh! Argh!

36:06.861 --> 36:09.029
Artie!

36:09.080 --> 36:12.616
[Artie and Pete choking]

36:14.168 --> 36:16.152
No!

36:16.170 --> 36:17.838
- Agh! Aah!
- [Roaring]

36:21.799 --> 36:23.016
[Grunting]

36:23.050 --> 36:25.334
How do I stop it, Myka?

36:25.352 --> 36:27.003
What do I do?
Tell me quickly!

36:27.021 --> 36:29.839
Put the amulet in the bag!

36:33.944 --> 36:36.345
[Roars]

36:36.363 --> 36:39.315
[Panting]

36:43.287 --> 36:45.354
Huh?

36:46.624 --> 36:50.960
Okay. Not dead.

36:50.995 --> 36:52.028
Wow.

36:52.046 --> 36:53.630
I imagine
she gets that a lot.

36:53.664 --> 36:55.465
At least once
every hundred years.

36:55.499 --> 36:58.134
Allow me reintroduce myself.

36:58.333 --> 37:02.420
I am the Countess
of St. Germaine.

37:02.471 --> 37:03.704
Sutton's wife.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.056
[Laughing]

37:05.090 --> 37:06.207
Who's Sutton?

37:06.225 --> 37:08.593
He was the count who--

37:08.644 --> 37:11.729
who died in Paris.

37:11.764 --> 37:13.714
I had no idea that thing
was even down there.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.650
Get in, get out--
that was the plan.

37:15.684 --> 37:18.102
In our business, things almost
never go as planned.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.386
- Wait.
- Uhh!

37:19.405 --> 37:21.388
Ohh...

37:21.407 --> 37:24.325
So in Paris,
Sutton...

37:24.359 --> 37:26.560
the... little weasel.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.080
He--he faked his own death
too, didn't he?

37:29.114 --> 37:31.833
Well, it comes in handy
when things get dodgy.

37:31.867 --> 37:34.252
It's easier to--
to disappear

37:34.286 --> 37:35.569
when everybody
thinks you're dead.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.738
But you didn't.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.907
You came back,
and you saved us.

37:39.925 --> 37:43.077
Why?

37:43.095 --> 37:46.931
I have dealt with agents
since the Ottoman Empire

37:46.965 --> 37:50.134
hosted the Warehouse
in 1561.

37:50.185 --> 37:54.522
Alexi from Warehouse 11
killed me twice.

37:54.556 --> 37:56.357
But you three...

37:56.391 --> 37:58.025
You--you were the first ones

37:58.060 --> 38:00.311
that risked your own life
to save mine.

38:00.362 --> 38:03.614
It would seem that even
the Warehouse has evolved.

38:03.649 --> 38:05.700
Wait, wait.
Not--not so fast, Countess.

38:05.734 --> 38:08.703
You may have misjudged us,
but the jury's still out on you.

38:08.737 --> 38:12.206
What were you looking for
in that Warehouse 12 crate?

38:16.278 --> 38:18.246
The philosopher's stone.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.831
From <i>Harry Potter.</i>

38:19.882 --> 38:21.833
From the Magnum Opus.

38:21.884 --> 38:24.719
It's said that that stone
can turn base metal into gold.

38:24.753 --> 38:27.722
Among other things.
Sutton said that a stone

38:27.756 --> 38:29.140
kept him from aging.

38:29.174 --> 38:31.092
- Not just him.
- Clearly.

38:31.126 --> 38:33.594
And now you've got...

38:33.628 --> 38:36.397
Do you mind?

38:36.431 --> 38:38.683
Oh, just half the stone?
Where's the other half?

38:38.734 --> 38:41.068
I don't know.
But I need to find it.

38:41.103 --> 38:42.820
Uh-huh, and then what?

38:42.855 --> 38:44.489
Unlimited power?

38:44.523 --> 38:46.107
Power?

38:46.141 --> 38:47.191
[Laughing] No.

38:47.242 --> 38:49.193
Then what do you want?

38:52.114 --> 38:55.500
Just to be like you.
Like... everyone else.

38:55.534 --> 38:59.036
I-I want to be mortal.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.873
You want to give up
immortality?

39:01.924 --> 39:03.508
Wait a minute.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.843
Are you crazy? I mean, who
wouldn't want to live forever?

39:05.878 --> 39:08.379
You might get to see the Browns
win a Super Bowl.

39:08.430 --> 39:09.463
The things you've seen.

39:09.497 --> 39:11.432
Imagine what you will see.

39:11.466 --> 39:12.934
Imagine what
you could accomplish.

39:12.968 --> 39:16.187
Yes, yes, but now imagine
everyone you have ever known,

39:16.221 --> 39:18.856
or will know, dying.

39:18.891 --> 39:21.776
Imagine never allowing yourself
to get close to somebody

39:21.810 --> 39:23.778
because
they don't understand.

39:23.812 --> 39:26.447
"Why don't you age?"

39:26.481 --> 39:30.618
Imagine the loneliness
and the solitude

39:30.652 --> 39:33.287
and the isolation.

39:33.322 --> 39:36.490
And then imagine watching
your only child

39:36.524 --> 39:39.043
go through that forever.

39:39.077 --> 39:44.582
That's why we had to try
to get into the...

39:44.633 --> 39:46.584
Had to go into...

39:46.635 --> 39:48.586
Only child...

39:48.637 --> 39:50.471
Nick. Oh, my God.
Nick--Nick is your son!

39:50.505 --> 39:52.223
He's been 15 for...

39:52.257 --> 39:57.395
Over 500 years.

39:57.429 --> 39:59.430
Immortality...

39:59.481 --> 40:02.099
is his prison.

40:02.150 --> 40:06.520
I've spent centuries
trying to release him from it.

40:06.554 --> 40:08.773
My son deserves
a real life.

40:08.824 --> 40:11.826
He deserves to fall in love
with somebody,

40:11.860 --> 40:14.006
to grow old
with somebody, to--

40:14.039 --> 40:15.443
To die.

40:18.033 --> 40:20.835
He'll die.

40:20.869 --> 40:23.287
You know that, right?

40:23.338 --> 40:26.123
'Cause that's what us,
we mere mortals, do.

40:26.174 --> 40:28.125
We die.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.795
And sometimes,
it's not pretty.

40:30.846 --> 40:34.799
[Crying] It's ugly
and it's messy and it's painful.

40:41.473 --> 40:42.923
[Sniffles]

40:51.533 --> 40:53.951
Myka what was that?

40:53.986 --> 40:55.286
It's nothing.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.654
No.

40:59.574 --> 41:02.293
No.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.795
We've been friends
way too long.

41:08.450 --> 41:10.217
Cards on the table.

41:15.257 --> 41:18.009
I have cancer.

41:20.462 --> 41:22.930
Is that it?
I mean...

41:22.964 --> 41:26.017
You're not gonna yell
or cry...

41:26.068 --> 41:28.069
[Sobbing]

41:33.975 --> 41:35.576
[Bell ringing]

41:35.610 --> 41:36.694
[Coughing]

41:36.745 --> 41:38.412
Claudia!

41:46.788 --> 41:47.755
Why is Nick at the B&B?

41:47.789 --> 41:49.373
We wanted something
from you,

41:49.424 --> 41:52.376
something I wasn't sure
that you'd give.

41:52.427 --> 41:54.261
Well...
[Buzzing]

41:55.862 --> 41:56.597
Yeah?

41:56.631 --> 41:58.849
Artie, you guys need to
get back here right now.

41:58.884 --> 42:00.301
Nick broke
into the Warehouse

42:00.335 --> 42:01.552
and released one of the Bronze
Sector prisoners,

42:01.603 --> 42:02.803
a guy names Paracelsus.

42:02.837 --> 42:04.305
The alchemist.

42:04.339 --> 42:05.940
Yeah, well, he was bronzed
for a reason.

42:05.974 --> 42:08.175
Probably a good one.
Where are they now?

42:08.193 --> 42:09.944
- They're gone.
- Gone?

42:09.978 --> 42:11.145
Oh, no, no.
That's not the plan.

42:11.179 --> 42:12.363
Nick said they'd wait.

42:12.397 --> 42:13.981
He would have told me
if things had changed.

42:14.015 --> 42:17.351
Artie...
he destroyed the bronzer.

42:17.369 --> 42:20.654
And, look...

42:20.688 --> 42:22.790
He bronzed Claudia.

42:26.194 --> 42:28.963
What did you do?

42:28.997 --> 42:31.048
[Gasps]
