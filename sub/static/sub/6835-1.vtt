01:28.589 --> 01:29.921
We close in 20 minutes.

01:49.318 --> 01:50.434
Damn!

01:53.572 --> 01:54.904
Thanks.

01:59.786 --> 02:00.776
Aah! Gee.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.613
- Ooh. Ow!
- Ow!

02:04.499 --> 02:06.616
- Ow!
- Argh.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.544
- Where the hell are these clowns?
- It is a large garage, sir.

02:18.305 --> 02:22.140
- We're over here!
- Are you an idiot?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.637
There they are.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.267
Get down.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.109
It's about time.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.063
I've sucked up enough fumes
to last me a lifetime.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.863
Stand up!

02:38.075 --> 02:40.408
What's with all this deep-throat crap?

02:40.619 --> 02:43.908
Don't look at me. It wasn't my idea
to meet here. It was his.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.988
We shouldn't be seen together.

02:46.208 --> 02:50.077
Just thinking of the safety factor
of Operation Fiasco.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.163
That's what I call this, sir.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.669
I work with the village idiot.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.877
- Do you guys have any idea--
- Sir, your glasses!

03:01.890 --> 03:05.804
Do you guys... Take off your glasses.

03:06.770 --> 03:10.559
Do you guys have any idea how many
police academies are in this state?

03:11.024 --> 03:15.314
- Is this a trick question, sir?
- No, this is not a trick question, sir.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.236
- Two.
- Wrong.

03:17.823 --> 03:21.533
My sources have informed me that
one of them is about to be terminated.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.700
- Which one?
- I don't know.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.154
They haven't decided yet.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.747
And that's where you two come in.

03:28.959 --> 03:33.203
I need two good men that'll make sure
Lassard's academy fails and not mine.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.964
I need two good men
that'll inform on Lassard's academy...

03:37.175 --> 03:39.132
...and tell me every move they make.

03:39.344 --> 03:43.213
I need two good men
that'll sell out their mothers to get ahead.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.223
- That's us.
- Good.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.302
Can we go now?

03:50.272 --> 03:52.013
We should split up.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.940
Safety factor. We'll go first.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.072
Looks like it's closed, sir.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.916
They locked us in.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.802
The car!

04:30.187 --> 04:31.394
Proctor!

04:31.563 --> 04:33.145
No problem, sir!

04:33.857 --> 04:35.223
I got it! Please!

04:35.442 --> 04:37.308
- My car!
- Please, stop!

04:47.120 --> 04:48.281
My car.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.556
As governor of this great state of ours...

05:13.772 --> 05:17.482
...it fills me with pride
to see these graduating police cadets.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.522
I'm also sad to tell you...

05:20.737 --> 05:24.151
...that this is the last time
we will be graduating two classes.

05:24.825 --> 05:25.941
What?

05:26.159 --> 05:30.904
It's time to tighten our belts.
It's time to close one of the academies.

05:31.581 --> 05:36.121
But in the spirit of fair play, which is
the hallmark of my administration...

05:36.336 --> 05:38.293
...I have appointed a committee...

05:38.713 --> 05:41.831
...to evaluate and compare
the two academies.

05:42.050 --> 05:45.259
That way, their fate will rest
in their own hands.

05:45.470 --> 05:49.464
I am certain that both commandants
will welcome such a challenge.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.349
Got it!

05:52.561 --> 05:56.305
Isn't that true, Comdt. Mauser
and Comdt. Lassard?

06:06.616 --> 06:09.905
Well, Comdt. Lassard, good luck, sir.

06:11.955 --> 06:15.414
- May the better academy win.
- We intend to, sir.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.951
Don't be too sure, Comdt. Mauser.

06:18.169 --> 06:22.755
We have many wonderful new recruits
which we shall mold in my own image.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.583
Promise me you'll do that, sir, please.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.885
Sir. The committee.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.678
Ladies, gentlemen, truly a pleasure.

06:33.894 --> 06:37.478
Anyone need a ride, police escort?
Don't hesitate to ask.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.857
Oh. Governor, magnificent speech!

06:42.277 --> 06:45.145
Bravo! I applaud you.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.440
Whoo! Whoo!

06:50.535 --> 06:52.197
Why beat around the bush, Mauser?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.699
Just get down on your knees
and kiss his ass.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.158
I don't need any tactical advice
from you, Callahan.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.742
Governor!

07:00.045 --> 07:01.206
Governor.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.789
I know you're a busy man, sir,
but I've been doing a study...

07:05.008 --> 07:07.500
...on some training techniques
I thought might interest you.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.302
The Governor is in a hurry,
Comdt. Mauser.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.880
I could memo you on these, sir.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.350
Governor, I speak for everyone
when I say--

07:19.481 --> 07:20.847
Let me assure you, Governor...

07:21.066 --> 07:23.353
...Comdt. Mauser
does not speak for this academy.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.934
Governor, what I meant to say was--

07:30.325 --> 07:34.444
Get a hold of yourself, you idiot.
You're making the Governor sick!

07:35.246 --> 07:36.282
Well, Mauser.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.081
You certainly made
a lasting impression on the Governor.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.626
The only impression that counts, sir,
is in this file!

07:43.505 --> 07:46.293
We'll see who's got an academy
when this is over.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.544
Proctor!

07:51.262 --> 07:53.470
You have nothing to worry about, sir.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.719
Right. Just leave everything to us.

07:56.434 --> 07:59.643
We'll make Mauser eat those words.
Let's go.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.013
- Mahoney.
- Right.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.810
Okay, come on now. Guys!

08:07.028 --> 08:08.269
<i>Girls.</i>

08:08.488 --> 08:11.401
Girls, of course, I'm sorry.
All right, keep it up! Number one!

08:11.616 --> 08:15.326
Take it on, drive it in here! Keep it alive.
Take it in, drive in!

08:15.537 --> 08:17.950
Keep your arms up! Take it! Take it on...

08:18.164 --> 08:20.497
Try! Bring it back. Stop. Stop the playing!

08:20.709 --> 08:24.703
Give me the ball. Gather around, girls.
I want to talk about something.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.833
I want you to remember from yesterday...

08:27.048 --> 08:29.256
Come a little closer. All right.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.801
Remember from yesterday,
you pick and roll? Now, ready and break!

08:33.013 --> 08:34.220
Number two. Keep it alive.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.549
<i>Police Academy
to Sgt. Mahoney. Come in, please.</i>

08:37.767 --> 08:39.258
Sgt. Mahoney's office.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.686
<i>Get me Mahoney,
and get your feet off the dashboard!</i>

08:45.150 --> 08:46.857
Good, take it along now.

08:47.402 --> 08:50.986
- I'm sorry, Sergeant. I didn't mean to.
- That's okay. My pleasure.

08:51.197 --> 08:55.316
Sgt. Mahoney, I just heard,
Comdt. Lassard needs help.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.367
Lassard's in trouble?

08:57.662 --> 08:58.903
Give it back!

09:01.958 --> 09:03.324
Wait. Wait for me!

09:03.543 --> 09:04.579
Go, Mom!

09:11.217 --> 09:12.753
<i>Sgt. Hightower, come in.</i>

09:12.969 --> 09:13.959
Shit.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.136
<i>Hightower, get rid of the pantyhose...</i>

09:16.306 --> 09:18.013
<i>...and report to the academy immediately.</i>

09:18.183 --> 09:19.424
I'm on my way.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.554
Eugene?

09:21.770 --> 09:23.978
Hey, Eugene.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.680
Tackleberry?

09:29.486 --> 09:31.853
Come on out, Eugene. I give up.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.856
You outdid yourself this time.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.316
Olly, olly, oxen free?

09:40.497 --> 09:42.910
All right, come on, Tackleberry,
I'm tired of this.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.161
Quit fooling around in the backyard.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.579
I'm serious. I got something to tell you.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.505
All right, come on, Eugene.
I'm getting pretty tired of this.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.382
Come on, Eugene,
I got an important message--

09:57.597 --> 09:59.680
Good one, Tack. Really fooled me.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.679
Mahoney called.
He said Lassard needs help.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.619
What a wonderful moment,
my favorite graduates back.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.160
The academy is facing
its greatest challenge.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.419
After many years...

10:31.631 --> 10:36.126
...of graduating many fine police officers,
the State says...

10:36.344 --> 10:39.178
...it can no longer afford
two police academies.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.847
God knows what they did with all the money.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.763
We have a tradition to uphold...

10:45.979 --> 10:48.813
...a reputation to defend,
and defend it, we will!

10:52.485 --> 10:54.977
- Thank you, Mahoney.
- Anytime, sir.

10:55.738 --> 11:00.324
With our new recruits and your help,
I'm sure we can survive the competition.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.281
There can only be one winner.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.749
But also only one loser,
which works out nicely.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.581
I certainly hope we win.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.254
Then I can retire
with the same sense of dignity...

11:14.465 --> 11:16.673
...I have always brought to the academy.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.174
Whoa!

11:19.012 --> 11:20.002
Dismissed.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.385
Get out of my way,
or I'll start playing rough.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.969
- Don't do that.
- No, I will not!

11:25.143 --> 11:27.806
You have the stupidest idea.
Put down that suitcase.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.809
- You are not going to that police academy.
- Wrong!

11:31.733 --> 11:32.769
Aah!

11:32.984 --> 11:36.603
Finally, don't you think one policeman
in this family is enough?

11:36.821 --> 11:39.063
Stop it! I don't care what you say!

11:40.950 --> 11:42.532
- Great, great.
- Great.

11:42.744 --> 11:46.829
Okay, listen. See, I just wanted
to join the force to be with you.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.200
I mean, we can ride together, we can wear
matching uniforms, share ammo...

11:51.419 --> 11:53.502
...everything that makes a marriage work.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.251
Honey, look. Listen to me, sweetheart.

11:57.300 --> 12:01.385
- Police work, it's just so dangerous.
- I don't care!

12:02.555 --> 12:03.545
Oh, no. No, you don't!

12:05.016 --> 12:07.633
You let go of me, mister,
or face the consequences!

12:07.852 --> 12:10.435
- Good morning, Facklers.
- Hello, Mrs. Pectelli.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.855
It is hell out there on those streets.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.563
- All right. Okay.
- Come on.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.362
Sweetie, what? Come on.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.611
We're adults.
I know we can talk this thing out.

12:23.826 --> 12:27.445
Exactly. I know you're smart enough
to do that work. It's just that...

12:27.664 --> 12:32.034
...I'm the breadwinner in this family, and
you're my lady, and your place is at home.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.244
Right? Come on, give me a kiss.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.833
What do you... Come on.

12:37.048 --> 12:40.166
You think I can't break this down?
Open it up, sweetie.

12:40.385 --> 12:43.503
I'm a policeman. I'm trained
for this kind of stuff, you know that?

12:43.721 --> 12:47.385
All right, big joke. Open that door!
Come on. You said we'd be adults.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.436
Hey! That's my...

12:58.903 --> 13:02.067
- Do you want to kill me?
- I have thought about it a couple of times.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.194
Honey, stop it right now! I'm serious!

13:04.409 --> 13:06.617
I don't care.
I wanna go to the police academy.

13:06.828 --> 13:10.572
Listen to reason, will you? Listen to me
right now. You are not gonna...

13:10.790 --> 13:13.407
- What are you doing?
- I want you off this car now!

13:13.626 --> 13:16.289
I just waxed this car.
You'll get me into so much trouble.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.999
This is a city street,
not a drag strip, thank you.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.846
If you don't like it, you go around me!

13:32.186 --> 13:35.054
--<i>with volume on the New York
Stock Exchange as of this hour...</i>

13:35.273 --> 13:40.143
<i>...at 56 million shares in moderate trading,
with the Dow Jones up 4 points at 1507.</i>

13:40.361 --> 13:43.399
<i>The dollar is showing renewed strength

13:43.614 --> 13:45.276
<i>...gaining 10 percent against the pound...</i>

13:45.491 --> 13:47.699
<i>...on rumors of the Fed's
dropping interest rates.</i>

13:47.910 --> 13:50.698
<i>The uncertainty of interest rates
is affecting the bond market.</i>

13:50.913 --> 13:52.870
<i>Trading has been cautious
and will remain...</i>

14:02.342 --> 14:04.083
This is not Le Mans!

14:42.840 --> 14:44.297
Porter. Redcap.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.628
That's right.
Could you help me with these, please?

14:49.222 --> 14:51.179
That's right. Come on over here.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.054
Thank you. That'll be fine, thank you.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.650
Porter.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.866
Please, sit down. Please.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.116
Um, uh, um...

15:13.621 --> 15:17.080
Zip your lips, slap your butts to the seat
and listen hard!

15:19.085 --> 15:20.576
That's a lot better.

15:20.795 --> 15:24.880
Let me be the first to welcome you
to the fabulous Midcity Police Academy.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.334
We're about to begin
an incredible 14-week adventure in living.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.670
I'm one of your hosts,
Sgt. Carey Mahoney.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.346
And as you exit the bus,
please form a double line.

15:33.558 --> 15:34.548
And march them!

15:51.409 --> 15:52.866
Who did that?

15:53.369 --> 15:55.361
Say, man, this place is crazy.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.412
Suckers always making me dance and stuff.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.457
What kind of place is this?
I don't look like I'm gonna make it.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.208
You'll make it just fine. Keep dancing.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.712
Hmm. Good.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.840
Good, tall. Good.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.804
Good, strong.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.140
Excuse me.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.469
And who might you be?

16:20.938 --> 16:24.648
Tomoko Nogata, of Tachikawa Nogatas.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.860
"And is this your lovely wife?"

16:30.573 --> 16:31.984
- Proctor.
- Yes, sir.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.409
- What's the story here with Fu Manchu?
- Fu Manchu.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.202
I don't have a Fu Manchu.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.905
I'm talking about the stir-fried shrimp
from out of town!

16:40.124 --> 16:41.911
He's with the Tachikawa Highway Patrol...

16:42.126 --> 16:45.164
...part of an international exchange
program, here to study our methods.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.120
I'm not teaching my cadets
how to use a wok!

16:50.009 --> 16:53.502
You ship him off to Lassard's.
He'll fit in perfectly over there.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.759
He could use a good sushi chef.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.596
- No offense, eh?
<i>- Arigato</i>, thank you.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.268
Kiss my what?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.645
Excuse me, sir.

17:11.864 --> 17:15.153
- Ma'am! I'm a ma'am!
- I'm sorry.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.031
Those guns make it difficult to tell.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.787
- Are you an instructor?
- Affirmative.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.114
Are you a new recruit?

17:22.333 --> 17:26.042
- Yes, I--
- She certainly is. But she's terribly shy.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.372
Stand up straight, Sarah.
And don't babble.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.456
What will the instructor think?

17:31.676 --> 17:33.793
- Now, just pay attention--
- Stifle it!

17:34.011 --> 17:36.253
Don't worry, Sarah.
When we're finished with you...

17:36.472 --> 17:38.805
...you'll have nerves of steel,
ice in your veins...

17:39.016 --> 17:41.884
...and a set of brass balls this big.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.345
No favoritism here, Eugene.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.353
Bud, here, he fouls up,
you give him a good whack.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.773
- Ha-ha-ha. Gotcha!
- That was a good one. Pretty sneaky.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.402
Caught me off guard.

18:00.663 --> 18:03.997
You take care of yourself, son.
And pay attention to Eugene.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.167
I'm proud of you.
You're gonna make one hell of a cop.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.995
Thanks, Dad.
Would you give this to Mom for me?

18:10.590 --> 18:13.549
Ha, ha. Don't forget to buckle up.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.293
That was a good one.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.219
Sorry!

18:23.394 --> 18:26.432
Boy, my dad and I have
a terrific relationship.

18:42.121 --> 18:46.115
Does anybody know how to shut
this thing off? It's driving me nuts!

18:47.001 --> 18:48.037
Thanks.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.259
Okay, that's $700.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.926
- Plus tip.
- Here you go.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.925
Hey. Hey, Wait a minute. What is this?

19:05.936 --> 19:09.270
What do you think you're giving me here?
What, are you kidding?

19:09.482 --> 19:11.895
I don't take any money
with pictures of tuna fish on it.

19:12.109 --> 19:15.147
Come on, American money.
Let's go. $700, that's what you owe me.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.446
Wait a minute. Excuse me.
What's going on here?

19:17.657 --> 19:21.071
- Not enough. He owes me $700, plus tip.
- $700 for a cab ride?

19:21.285 --> 19:24.198
- Where did you catch this cab, Yokohama?
- Yokohama.

19:27.792 --> 19:31.376
Excuse me. I'm Officer Carey Mahoney.
May I be of some assistance?

19:31.587 --> 19:34.250
- Yes. This guy is trying to rip off this guy.
- "Rip off."

19:34.465 --> 19:38.004
- Read the meter. The meter don't lie.
- Is this true? And who's your barber?

19:38.219 --> 19:40.802
Look, wise guy,
don't think a blue uniform scares me.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.097
- No, sir, this is not a scary uniform.
- No, it's not a scary uniform.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.924
- Hightower!
- That's a scary uniform.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.226
This man just said something
about your mother.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.145
He also charged this guy $700
for a cab ride.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.940
- A rip-off.
- Meters don't lie. Read the meter.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.815
They don't lie. They never lie.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.357
Meters don't lie.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.910
This meter lied. It's a lying meter.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.991
- Fair price.
- And tip.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.167
- What's your name, son?
- Nogata.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.041
- Nogata? New recruit?
- Yes.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.373
- Right over there.
- Thank you. Okay.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.626
- Thanks, Hightower.
- Okay, babe.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.302
Excuse me.

20:26.517 --> 20:29.260
That sordid little scene
must have been trying on you, Miss...

20:29.478 --> 20:30.559
Karen Adams.

20:30.771 --> 20:34.606
You're Karen Adams?
You're kidding. Aah, we're roomies!

20:34.817 --> 20:37.400
I'll help you settle in.
You'll take your clothes off...

20:37.611 --> 20:39.273
- ...we'll shower, get close--
- I'm sorry.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.856
I'm not here to get hit on by every guy
who looks cute in a blue uniform.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.067
I want to be a policewoman.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.610
You will be!

20:46.996 --> 20:49.704
We'll get together. We'll talk! I hope.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.208
Oh.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.661
Well, Mahoney,
I see you still have very good taste.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.167
Ha, ha. Thank you.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.431
Nice bike!

21:17.067 --> 21:20.060
Where do you put the batteries?
Ha-ha-ha.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.526
Get out of my way!

21:37.296 --> 21:38.628
That didn't hurt!

21:41.091 --> 21:43.083
Hi, was I going too fast?

21:52.937 --> 21:54.553
Where do I go to register?

21:54.772 --> 21:57.685
- Let's go. Kirkland, 46!
- Yeah, all right.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.313
- Fackler, where do you think you're going?
- With him.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.485
- Women downstairs!
- Damn!

22:02.696 --> 22:05.154
Move it! Let's go. Come on now, girls!

22:05.366 --> 22:09.076
- Move it.
- All right, Sweetchuck, let's go.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.001
- Aah!
- Hey!

22:23.592 --> 22:24.753
Oh, hi.

22:24.969 --> 22:27.757
- What's your problem?
- He's the problem. He's an animal.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.134
Get used to it. He's your roommate.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.933
- Aah! Roommate?
- Zed's reformed. He's on our side now.

22:34.144 --> 22:37.854
Yeah. I used to be a real jerk,
but now I'm a people guy.

22:44.196 --> 22:50.284
<i>It's tough to be a truck driver cowgirl</i>

22:54.540 --> 22:55.872
You're awake!

22:56.083 --> 22:59.042
What kind of music do you like?
You like salsa? You like reggae?

22:59.253 --> 23:00.994
Something with that love beat?

23:01.547 --> 23:06.087
This is a song I wrote, off my first album.
And it goes something like this.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.840
<i>When I was a baby I had no head</i>

23:10.055 --> 23:12.763
<i>I couldn't get a job, I couldn't go to bed</i>

23:13.100 --> 23:17.060
It was originally a love ballad,
but I kind of spruced it up.

23:20.858 --> 23:23.601
No, I don't take requests.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.106
All right, clowns...

23:26.322 --> 23:29.440
...I want you to police this entire area
from here to the parade ground.

23:29.658 --> 23:33.447
I want you to pick up every cigarette butt,
every scrap of paper, every weed.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.528
Now, we're gonna be watching
from my window.

23:35.748 --> 23:39.082
So if I see these flashlights stop moving,
you're both in big trouble.

23:39.293 --> 23:42.001
Big trouble. Now, get to work.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.291
Let's go, Chad.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.225
- Mr. Zed.
- No school.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.898
- Mr. Zed.
- What?

24:04.109 --> 24:07.398
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- Of course it's gonna work.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.405
It's working.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.784
Hup, two, three, four.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.876
As you can see, sir,
I have instant access over all my cadets...

24:27.091 --> 24:28.957
...and all of the instructors.

24:29.259 --> 24:32.502
Attention! Give me 20 pushups, now!

24:35.099 --> 24:37.011
There's no escaping the camera's eye, sir.

24:37.226 --> 24:40.139
As you could see,
I can monitor the gym, the classrooms...

24:40.354 --> 24:41.811
<i>The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show?</i>

24:42.022 --> 24:45.140
Oh. Good! This is the episode
where Natasha and Boris have Rocky--

24:46.276 --> 24:48.313
It's an old one, though. I've seen it. Rerun.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.942
We have a few bugs to be worked out, sir...

24:51.156 --> 24:53.398
...but I'm sure
you'll tell the evaluation committee...

24:53.617 --> 24:55.324
...about the wonderful work
we're doing in--

24:55.536 --> 24:59.530
Ah-ah-ah. You're chapping your lips
on the wrong butt, Mr. Mauser.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.995
I have no say
with the evaluation committee.

25:03.585 --> 25:07.124
Besides, I want both academies
to look good.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.457
Oh, so do I, sir. So do I.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.669
And when may the committee
be coming by, sir?

25:14.388 --> 25:18.382
The committee is spending the rest
of the week at Lassard's academy.

25:18.600 --> 25:23.095
Next week, the Governor has them
snooping around the downtown precincts.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.020
So that gives you...

25:25.357 --> 25:28.316
...a couple of weeks
to perfect your ass-kissing.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.859
That's plenty of time, sir.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.936
Hi.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.356
--two and three.

25:34.575 --> 25:35.782
Ah, Callahan, there you are.

25:35.993 --> 25:38.781
We have to talk to you
about this evaluation thing.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.703
I'll see you at my...

25:44.126 --> 25:48.211
And four! And one, and two, and three!

26:21.789 --> 26:23.746
Close there. Whoo!

26:28.420 --> 26:31.629
Not only must you know all traffic laws...

26:31.840 --> 26:35.174
...you must also master
high-speed driving.

26:35.636 --> 26:39.550
Now, we'll begin today
with a leisurely spin around the course.

26:44.353 --> 26:46.094
Hey. Watch where you're going, lady!

26:59.785 --> 27:02.027
Okay, you can start the car now.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.954
But if I hear any of those things,
you've failed.

27:05.165 --> 27:08.283
Oops. Wrong key. I'll be right back.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.043
That's no problem.

27:21.849 --> 27:23.431
Very often in the field...

27:23.642 --> 27:25.929
...the dog can be your best friend.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.889
Your most faithful partner.

27:28.105 --> 27:31.143
Oh, I love dogs, and they love me.
Hi, boy, hi.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.151
First... Out.

27:38.574 --> 27:39.610
Thanks.

27:39.825 --> 27:43.239
It is important to develop
the master-dog relationship.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.536
If you show any fear...

27:46.165 --> 27:48.327
...the dog will not respect you.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.742
- Sweetchuck.
- Me?

27:50.961 --> 27:53.749
- Order the dogs to sit.
- They won't listen to me.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.796
They will. Come on, try.

27:57.593 --> 27:58.879
Go on, have a seat.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.381
You've got to show them who's boss.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.637
Sit!

28:17.404 --> 28:18.611
Ha!

28:20.574 --> 28:22.236
At this time...

28:22.659 --> 28:25.618
...I would like to introduce to all of you...

28:25.996 --> 28:29.865
...my instructor,
the man who taught me how to fight.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.244
Please welcome, if you will...

28:35.047 --> 28:36.959
...Sgt. John Hurney.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.819
Now, can I have a volunteer?

29:08.205 --> 29:11.824
Can I have a volunteer?
Very good, Nogata.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.989
I don't believe it.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.949
Oh, boy!

29:53.000 --> 29:54.116
He's great!

30:13.645 --> 30:17.104
You, uh, have impressive moves for a cadet.

30:17.733 --> 30:18.940
Thank you.

30:19.151 --> 30:23.065
You see, it's a matter of the mind
being mightier than the bosom.

30:26.116 --> 30:27.823
Interesting theory.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.535
I said bosom, not sword.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.037
Sounds like a common mistake.

30:37.252 --> 30:42.122
No. I mean no disrespect.
It's just that she's so...

30:43.050 --> 30:44.837
Wow.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.800
Wow. What a woman!

30:48.638 --> 30:50.004
Hit the showers!

30:50.515 --> 30:52.097
See what I mean?

30:52.684 --> 30:55.176
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.056
Ugh!

31:14.539 --> 31:15.950
Miss Macho.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.538
All right, men, it's 2200.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.215
Time to hit the sack.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.214
Let's go.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.381
<i>You're dead meat, copper!</i>

31:37.896 --> 31:39.432
Let's move it!

31:45.695 --> 31:48.278
- What time is it?
- 3 in the morning.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.034
All right, everybody!
Everybody up! Let's go!

32:00.585 --> 32:02.042
Outside!

32:03.630 --> 32:04.962
Let's go!

32:13.515 --> 32:17.509
Come on, you sludge buckets.
If I can keep up this pace, so can you.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.393
Let's go, maggots.

32:19.604 --> 32:24.520
A good cop is always prepared.
A good cop knows the city streets.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.155
- Are you gonna be all right, Hedges?
- He'll be okay.

32:31.366 --> 32:34.325
- Can I help you with anything?
- No, we're here now.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.954
- Bye, Hedges.
- I'll have to be fed intravenously.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.822
Just lie down.

32:51.428 --> 32:52.919
What is this?

32:53.138 --> 32:55.846
It's my bed. I pick up in New Delhi.

32:56.057 --> 32:59.050
Posture-o-pedic. Very good for back.

33:10.614 --> 33:12.651
Hello? Hello?

33:14.201 --> 33:15.612
Who is that?

33:15.827 --> 33:17.659
What--? Who is it? Don't--

33:21.625 --> 33:24.288
Do you want to, like,
borrow my shampoo?

33:32.844 --> 33:35.211
Freeze! Identify yourself.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.796
It's me, Mr. Sweetchuck.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.099
You look like a man
who's going AWOL to me, mister.

33:40.310 --> 33:43.894
Yeah, I am. I'm tired of having a roommate
that's an animal!

33:44.105 --> 33:46.768
I was happier when I was at home
getting mugged!

33:46.983 --> 33:50.192
You look me in the eye
and tell me you're quitting!

33:51.696 --> 33:52.903
Hey.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.356
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.025
You give me a chance...

33:58.620 --> 34:00.612
...and I'll make you into a man.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.622
Even if it kills you.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.998
Feel good? Let's go.

34:17.764 --> 34:18.971
Sergeant.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.188
A good kick may be all that stands...

34:36.408 --> 34:39.150
...between you and the excruciating pain...

34:39.369 --> 34:43.362
...of a.357 magnum slug
shredding your vital organs.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.328
Fackler! You're up.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.663
Yay.

34:54.342 --> 34:55.628
Kirkland!

35:09.858 --> 35:11.019
Zed!

35:19.993 --> 35:22.360
- Sweetchuck!
- Sweetchuck, what's the word?

35:22.579 --> 35:23.945
- Kill.
- Let me hear it again.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.905
- Kill.
- Now go for it!

35:34.341 --> 35:36.583
Whose bright idea was it to meet here?

35:36.801 --> 35:38.633
It was my bright idea.

35:39.179 --> 35:42.092
This is some beautiful view, isn't it, sir?

35:42.766 --> 35:46.476
The twinkling lights of the city,
stars in the heavens...

35:46.686 --> 35:48.393
...the moon in the sky.

35:48.897 --> 35:52.641
And Mr. Sandman flying
from rooftop to rooftop.

35:52.859 --> 35:53.940
Where?

35:54.152 --> 35:56.018
What the hell is that?

35:56.363 --> 35:59.652
Give me this damn thing.
Well, how'd it go?

35:59.866 --> 36:02.108
The committee knew right away
we were hopeless.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.363
Good.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.155
Now, I want you guys
to take the cadets downtown...

36:07.374 --> 36:08.410
...for some fieldwork.

36:08.625 --> 36:12.118
We can't do that. Cadets don't go
into the field till after their tenth week.

36:12.337 --> 36:15.876
- They're not ready for anything like that.
- I know that, you moron.

36:16.091 --> 36:20.802
That's the whole idea. Next week, the
evaluation committee is gonna be there.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.971
- Oh, I get it, sir.
- I doubt it.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.390
Heh. Sorry, sir.

36:27.268 --> 36:30.227
I'm gonna be there
when Lassard's guys screw up.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.431
You guys make sure they screw up. Get it?

36:33.650 --> 36:34.640
- Yes, sir.
- Get it?

36:34.859 --> 36:35.849
- Yeah.
- Good.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.208
Punch him! Punch him!

36:59.551 --> 37:03.511
One, two, three, four.

37:06.766 --> 37:09.304
That's great. He's looking tired. Good.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.351
Your legs are rubbery.

37:14.482 --> 37:18.726
- Knock him out. Let me hear you say it.
- Knock him out.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.277
Come on, come on!

37:46.681 --> 37:47.842
What are you doing?

37:48.057 --> 37:51.676
That's not the way I taught you to hit.
You gotta hit like this. Like this!

37:51.895 --> 37:53.386
Now, hit him!

38:17.295 --> 38:22.131
The eyewitness is still
the main source of convictions.

38:22.801 --> 38:26.715
Mr. Miller, I want you to take your time.
Study these men very carefully.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.926
Then tell us if you see the man
who robbed your store.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.848
Let me reassure you, Mr. Miller...

38:32.060 --> 38:35.303
...the suspects cannot see you
when it's dark in here.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.602
Well, Mr. Miller? Is he there?

38:40.485 --> 38:41.817
You sure they can't see me?

38:41.986 --> 38:44.228
My wife said they'd see me,
and not to do this.

38:44.447 --> 38:47.281
Mr. Miller, bright lights in there...

38:47.492 --> 38:51.281
...dark in here. He can't see us.
Do you see him?

38:52.956 --> 38:54.913
Bringing cadets into the field this early...

38:55.124 --> 38:57.411
...has all the makings
of one of your lousy ideas.

38:57.627 --> 38:59.994
What's the matter, Mahoney?
No faith in the cadets?

39:00.213 --> 39:02.580
How hard can it be, Miller?
Is he there or isn't he?

39:02.799 --> 39:06.167
I don't know.
He really didn't steal that much.

39:06.553 --> 39:09.170
Well, the hospital stay was quite restful.

39:09.722 --> 39:11.258
I wish I'd listened to my wife.

39:11.474 --> 39:15.514
For God's sake, Miller, will you
take your balls out of your wife's purse...

39:15.728 --> 39:17.560
...and finger the dirtbag?

39:18.106 --> 39:19.347
It's him!

39:20.066 --> 39:23.309
- Come on, you son of a bitch! I'll kill you!
- No, it's him.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.269
He's the one, the priest.

39:32.495 --> 39:35.659
Sir, honestly, we had no idea
the evaluation committee would be here.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.866
We thought
it would help advance the training.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.997
- What do you mean, we?
- It was a lousy idea.

39:41.212 --> 39:45.422
Now I've got a bunch trainees hanging
around with this damn committee!

39:46.551 --> 39:49.965
I've been, like, noticing you,
and you're a nice enough lady...

39:50.179 --> 39:51.966
...but you're too tense.

39:52.181 --> 39:54.639
You got to relax. You got to calm down.

40:00.565 --> 40:03.558
You take the big guy,
I'll take the little guy.

40:03.943 --> 40:05.400
We got a cop.

40:14.287 --> 40:16.574
No sweat. This is my old gang.

40:18.374 --> 40:22.334
Would you like to go out to grab a burger
and then go to the movies or something?

40:23.421 --> 40:27.131
I'd like to introduce you guys
to the future Mrs. Zed!

40:51.866 --> 40:53.027
Hey, son.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.902
- Excuse me, Officer.
- Yes, ma'am?

40:56.120 --> 40:58.533
We are sitting in the nonsmoking section...

40:58.748 --> 41:02.367
...and that man refuses
to put out his cigar.

41:04.253 --> 41:06.495
I'll take care of this, ma'am.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.713
Excuse me, sir.

41:09.092 --> 41:13.382
You're sitting in a nonsmoking area.
Would you please extinguish that cigar?

41:13.596 --> 41:15.713
Drop dead.
I'll put it out when I'm finished.

41:15.932 --> 41:18.094
You'll put it out now, mister!

41:33.157 --> 41:34.318
Hit it!

41:35.451 --> 41:36.817
Now, go get him!

41:48.297 --> 41:50.664
- Hurry up!
- I'm trying. I'm going as fast--

41:50.883 --> 41:51.873
- Drive!
- Aah!

42:13.906 --> 42:16.193
Will this count against us, sir?

42:19.120 --> 42:23.330
You know, I've been here at the academy
many wonderful years...

42:23.541 --> 42:25.453
...and I'm very fond of it.

42:26.753 --> 42:29.245
- The new cadets are doing well?
- Yes, sir.

42:29.464 --> 42:33.504
- We are going to succeed now, aren't we?
- Yes, sir.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.752
Good. Good, good.

42:56.657 --> 43:00.776
One more ping out of you, Jonesey,
I'll tape your lips permanently together.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.995
Hey, Jon--

43:06.084 --> 43:07.666
Listen, everybody.

43:07.877 --> 43:11.211
I want you to forget today. You don't have
to be ready for the field yet.

43:11.422 --> 43:14.039
- We sure proved that.
- It wasn't a total loss.

43:14.258 --> 43:15.874
Of course it wasn't.

43:16.094 --> 43:19.007
One police car and two civilian cars
completely totaled...

43:19.222 --> 43:20.679
...three citizens' complaints...

43:20.890 --> 43:24.429
...two members of the evaluation committee
under heavy sedation.

43:24.644 --> 43:27.307
I wouldn't call it a total loss,
would you? No.

43:27.522 --> 43:30.856
Bartender, how about some champagne
for me and my associate?

43:31.067 --> 43:33.559
We're celebrating. Come on, Proctor.

43:37.198 --> 43:39.406
- Let's just get out of here.
- No.

43:46.499 --> 43:48.832
Boy, that's a waste of champagne, sir.

43:49.043 --> 43:51.376
Now, what is that crack
supposed to mean, Mahoney?

43:51.587 --> 43:55.376
It means we don't think you can tell the
difference between beer and champagne.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.718
You know something?
You two are brain dead.

43:59.929 --> 44:02.012
Oh. Bet you can't. Loser pays.

44:02.682 --> 44:05.925
- You're on, Mahoney.
- Can I have a beer in the same glass?

44:06.144 --> 44:08.010
- Mind if we blindfold you, sir?
- Why?

44:08.229 --> 44:10.095
- We wouldn't want you to peek.
- Right.

44:10.314 --> 44:12.476
- See anything? Huh?
- No.

44:12.692 --> 44:13.899
- Sure?
- No, I can't see.

44:14.110 --> 44:17.228
Okay. Round and round
and guess the drink.

44:24.537 --> 44:26.403
- Champagne!
- Oh!

44:26.622 --> 44:28.329
You win! He always wins!

44:29.959 --> 44:32.576
All right, we'll pay up.
Let's get out of here.

44:32.795 --> 44:35.663
- You two jerks.
- You really showed them, sir.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.839
- Proctor.
- Yes, sir?

44:42.346 --> 44:44.963
Oh.
Give me a hand with this. Take it off.

44:45.850 --> 44:48.843
No, don't go slow.
Go fast, so it doesn't hurt.

44:52.857 --> 44:55.645
That hurt. Am I okay?

44:55.860 --> 44:58.694
It's nice. There's a mirror right here, sir.

45:01.115 --> 45:02.697
I got no eyebrows.

45:03.826 --> 45:06.614
- Where are my eyebrows?
- Right here, sir.

45:08.664 --> 45:11.498
- This is going very well.
- Yeah?

45:11.667 --> 45:15.081
Oh, yeah. That's great. It's coming.

45:15.922 --> 45:19.131
That's great. That's nice.
You're gonna like that, sir.

45:19.342 --> 45:20.423
Let me see it.

45:21.052 --> 45:24.045
Look at that. Look at this,
this angle over here, every angle.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.380
- I can't see it!
- It's yours.

45:30.102 --> 45:32.594
So, what do you think, sir?

45:33.397 --> 45:34.604
I think I like it.

45:35.066 --> 45:37.399
Commissioner Hurst was very upset.

45:38.027 --> 45:41.941
He used many bad words
to describe our academy.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.567
Some were even foreign.

45:43.783 --> 45:46.617
Italian or Irish, I think.

45:48.537 --> 45:51.200
This is survival of the fittest...

45:51.415 --> 45:53.828
...and after what happened downtown...

45:54.043 --> 45:55.454
...it seems we're not very fit.

45:55.670 --> 45:59.755
- Sir, you're not giving up, are you?
- Of course not.

46:00.132 --> 46:02.920
I have no doubt we shall be victorious.

46:03.636 --> 46:08.597
Well, I have a little doubt,
but, basically, I'm an optimist.

46:08.808 --> 46:12.927
Now, I know the committee
will be observing us here...

46:14.438 --> 46:18.307
...and in the field,
and at the Policepersons Ball...

46:18.776 --> 46:22.065
...so we must do nothing
to dishonor the uniform.

46:25.908 --> 46:28.366
- What was I saying?
- Dismissed!

46:28.577 --> 46:29.658
Right.

46:31.789 --> 46:34.702
This map will pinpoint trouble spots...

46:34.917 --> 46:37.330
...over a 10-square-mile area.

46:38.170 --> 46:41.959
This dispatch unit has a 200-mile range...

46:43.301 --> 46:45.338
...and a computerized city grid.

46:45.553 --> 46:49.297
This computerized city grid
tracks police vehicle movement.

46:50.224 --> 46:52.887
- Is that clear, everyone?
- Yes, ma'am!

46:53.102 --> 46:54.559
Yeah, why not?

46:56.981 --> 46:58.517
In tear gas training...

46:58.733 --> 47:01.020
...the manual says
you should have your mask on.

47:01.235 --> 47:05.229
Be out of here 30 seconds after
the canister comes through the window.

47:05.448 --> 47:06.859
Any questions?

47:08.451 --> 47:09.737
Good luck.

47:20.838 --> 47:23.876
- Nice throw, Hightower.
- It went in, didn't it?

47:28.012 --> 47:29.753
All right, everybody out!

47:35.061 --> 47:37.599
Everybody present and accounted for?

47:42.985 --> 47:46.353
I feel good. I'll be in there if you need me.

47:52.036 --> 47:54.824
Look, I know you people
have had a tough week...

47:55.039 --> 47:57.156
...but there's something you should know.

47:57.375 --> 48:00.493
You may be the last class
to attend this academy.

48:01.003 --> 48:04.872
I don't know if this means anything to you,
but it sure does to us.

48:05.424 --> 48:09.134
That's why, we not only
want you to keep up the good work...

48:09.345 --> 48:10.961
...we want you to work harder.

48:11.180 --> 48:12.967
Because we think that you people...

48:13.182 --> 48:15.299
...can be the best class
this academy has ever seen.

48:15.518 --> 48:17.510
You can do it. Believe me.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.640
Once, even I was a screw-up.

48:20.106 --> 48:23.565
Let's go out there and win one
for Comdt. Lassard, okay?

48:23.776 --> 48:25.859
Okay? Yeah, come on.

48:26.904 --> 48:29.362
Okay. Yeah.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.523
Attention!

48:32.493 --> 48:33.700
Dismissed.

48:35.079 --> 48:36.445
Did you hear that?

48:36.664 --> 48:39.702
No? Of course not. How silly of me to ask.

48:39.917 --> 48:42.159
You're too far from the window.

48:44.880 --> 48:46.587
- Look sharp, Mahoney.
- Right.

48:46.799 --> 48:48.210
- Sgt. Mahoney.
- Yeah.

48:48.426 --> 48:50.713
- I was really impressed by what you said.
- Oh.

48:51.095 --> 48:52.461
You really care.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.673
Yeah. Just don't spread it around.
It might ruin my rep.

48:55.891 --> 48:59.680
I owe you an apology for the way I acted.
You were just trying to be cute.

48:59.895 --> 49:04.765
Trying? On a cuteness scale of one to 10,
I'm an eight.

49:04.984 --> 49:07.101
- Five.
- You're right, I am a five.

49:07.445 --> 49:10.779
Listen, I'll accept your apology
if you accept mine.

49:11.240 --> 49:13.698
- Deal.
- All right. You know something?

49:13.909 --> 49:17.152
Have you ever felt,
after meeting someone for 10 minutes...

49:17.371 --> 49:20.034
- ...you've known them for two, three years?
- No.

49:20.249 --> 49:23.083
- Oh.
- Aah! Mahoney.

49:23.461 --> 49:25.748
- Thanks, Mahoney.
- Welcome, sir.

49:47.818 --> 49:51.858
Excuse, please. Shall I come back
when all is well with your mind?

49:52.823 --> 49:56.282
My mind is as well as it gets,
but you look a little tense.

49:56.994 --> 50:00.158
You see, I have great confusions...

50:00.831 --> 50:03.244
...about Sgt. Callahan.

50:06.170 --> 50:08.503
You've come to the right place, brother.

50:09.256 --> 50:12.499
Grab yourself pad and pencil because...

50:13.260 --> 50:16.344
...the love doctor is about to speak.

50:19.266 --> 50:20.973
Yo!

50:29.777 --> 50:31.689
In my country, it is written...

50:31.904 --> 50:35.147
...only kiss of beautiful woman...

50:35.741 --> 50:39.655
...can compare to petal of a rose...

50:42.164 --> 50:43.245
...babe.

50:49.004 --> 50:51.542
In America, talk is cheap.

50:56.554 --> 50:58.716
I love America.

51:26.417 --> 51:29.910
Hey. Hi, there. Remember me?

51:32.047 --> 51:35.040
Ah, yes, of course. How could I forget?

51:35.259 --> 51:36.716
Who was that?

51:37.177 --> 51:38.918
Just an old friend.

51:39.471 --> 51:42.839
Why are we celebrating?
It's Mauser, 42. Lassard, zip.

51:43.058 --> 51:44.469
You think we're doing that well?

51:44.685 --> 51:47.723
- Mahoney.
- Oh.

51:47.938 --> 51:50.601
How's tricks? Not to worry.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.432
Oh.

51:52.651 --> 51:55.109
Your friend forgot to wear
her "for rent" sign.

51:55.321 --> 51:59.406
Oh. She's such a sweet kid.
My aerobics instructor.

52:00.826 --> 52:05.241
Mahoney, see this ear?
It's a finely tuned crap detector.

52:05.456 --> 52:09.450
Oh. And a lovely ear it is. If I blow in it,
will you follow me anywhere?

52:09.877 --> 52:13.496
Well, I'm surprised
you had the nerve to show up...

52:13.714 --> 52:16.627
...after your cadets humiliated
the Police Department.

52:16.842 --> 52:19.004
Personally, it makes me sick.

52:19.386 --> 52:22.629
How about you guys?
Don't you guys think...

52:25.309 --> 52:27.141
Coming, Commissioner.

52:30.814 --> 52:32.976
Will you think less of me
if I call him a slime bucket?

52:33.150 --> 52:37.064
Mm-mm. In fact, I'll have my aerobics
instructor confirm it. I'll be right back.

52:38.697 --> 52:40.438
Hey.

52:40.658 --> 52:44.777
- So how you doing?
- Terrific. I need one of your special favors.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.700
- Right here?
- Mm-mm-mm.

52:54.129 --> 52:58.089
Oh. I just love a man
that eats shrimp that way.

52:58.300 --> 53:00.758
- You do?
- Oh, yes.

53:01.845 --> 53:03.006
Come on.

53:05.599 --> 53:09.343
- How does he do that?
- The question is, why does he do that?

53:10.020 --> 53:12.353
It is a power of the mind.

53:36.046 --> 53:37.127
Allow me.

53:37.339 --> 53:40.377
What kind of idiot klutz are you?

53:41.385 --> 53:42.967
Come on, dumpling.

53:43.178 --> 53:46.888
I witnessed the entire attack, sir.
My apologies, Mrs. Hurst.

53:47.099 --> 53:51.184
May I say Copeland is not one of my cadets.
He is a member of Lassard's staff.

53:51.395 --> 53:55.105
You look different, Mauser.
Are you putting on weight?

53:55.607 --> 53:57.940
Come on, dumpling.
We'll get you cleaned up.

53:58.152 --> 54:02.066
That's Lassard's staff, sir.
Send me the cleaning bill on that, sir.

54:12.708 --> 54:14.540
You want the last shrimp?

54:15.169 --> 54:19.254
- There's only one thing that I want.
- What? I'll call room service.

54:19.465 --> 54:21.001
Don't be silly.

54:21.592 --> 54:25.836
What I want is for you to wait in there,
in the bathroom...

54:26.054 --> 54:27.340
...while I get ready.

54:27.556 --> 54:30.094
- Why can't I wait in here?
- We just met.

54:30.309 --> 54:33.177
Come on, can't a girl be
a little bit old-fashioned?

54:33.395 --> 54:36.729
I'll call you just as soon as I'm ready.

54:39.777 --> 54:41.860
Come on, it's kind of drafty.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.771
I'll get some help.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.857
A little patience. I'll be out in a minute.

54:48.368 --> 54:50.735
Hurry up. Somebody wants to use the...

54:54.458 --> 54:57.451
Come on, let me in! Hurry up!

54:59.797 --> 55:02.255
You should be ashamed of yourself.

55:04.468 --> 55:06.630
I'll make up your room in a minute.

55:07.471 --> 55:09.383
Where you going with my cart?

55:09.681 --> 55:12.048
- My cart.
- Let me borrow it.

55:12.267 --> 55:13.974
I'm a police officer--

55:15.020 --> 55:16.352
It's mine.

55:17.481 --> 55:19.188
What's this?

55:22.486 --> 55:24.978
Hi. Warm tonight.

55:26.698 --> 55:28.280
How's it going?

55:34.206 --> 55:35.788
Aah! Ow!

55:57.020 --> 56:00.604
<i>It's a comfort
And a strange kind of notion</i>

56:00.816 --> 56:04.059
<i>Knowing that you got complete devotion</i>

56:04.278 --> 56:07.362
<i>To feel no matter what's the problem</i>

56:07.573 --> 56:10.281
<i>Together we can solve it</i>

56:10.492 --> 56:13.610
<i>It's a team thing, it takes two</i>

56:13.829 --> 56:17.197
<i>It's all the time me, all the time you</i>

56:17.416 --> 56:20.159
<i>It's a team thing I'm talking about</i>

56:20.377 --> 56:23.415
<i>It's a team thing all the way out</i>

56:23.630 --> 56:27.340
<i>It goes like this now
Oo-oo shoo-bee-do-doo-bee</i>

56:27.634 --> 56:31.002
<i>Oo-oo shoo-bee-do-doo-bee</i>

56:31.221 --> 56:34.259
<i>Oo-oo shoo-bee-do-doo-bee</i>

56:34.474 --> 56:37.558
<i>No one could ever make me doubt you</i>

56:37.769 --> 56:41.809
<i>They know I care too much About my baby</i>

56:42.024 --> 56:44.892
<i>It's a team thing, it takes two</i>

56:45.652 --> 56:48.690
<i>It's all the time me, all the time you</i>

56:48.906 --> 56:52.115
<i>It's a team thing I'm talking about</i>

56:52.326 --> 56:55.569
<i>It's a team thing all the way out</i>

56:55.787 --> 56:58.746
<i>It's a team thing, it takes two</i>

56:58.957 --> 57:02.667
<i>It's all the time me, all the time you</i>

57:02.878 --> 57:05.291
<i>It's a team thing I'm talking about</i>

57:05.505 --> 57:08.839
<i>It's a team thing all the way out</i>

57:09.051 --> 57:12.340
<i>It's a team thing, it takes two</i>

57:13.013 --> 57:16.131
--hands him the ticket,
and the driver said--

57:16.350 --> 57:19.843
Ha-ha-ha. That's real funny, sir.
Great joke teller, the Commissioner.

57:20.062 --> 57:22.179
Are you enjoying yourselves?
Are you comfortable?

57:22.397 --> 57:24.855
Waiter, round of drinks. On me.

57:25.275 --> 57:27.437
Drinks are free, you idiot.

57:27.653 --> 57:30.817
Oh. Yes, sir. How stupid of me.

57:31.031 --> 57:33.193
If you don't mind
my saying so, Mrs. Hurst...

57:33.408 --> 57:36.321
...that fruit punch stain dried real nicely.

57:38.872 --> 57:41.910
You are not going to influence
this evaluation committee.

57:42.125 --> 57:45.038
So will you please stop all this slobbering?

57:45.253 --> 57:49.293
Sir, I think I can get it under control
if I could only find out who's winning.

57:49.508 --> 57:55.129
Well, let's just say that Lassard's cadets
have not exactly impressed them.

57:55.973 --> 57:57.885
Thank you very much, sir.

57:58.100 --> 57:59.841
Get hold of yourself, man.

58:01.353 --> 58:04.061
Good Lord! You're falling apart.

58:07.025 --> 58:09.563
- Excuse me. Commissioner?
- What the hell do you want?

58:09.778 --> 58:12.566
We've had reports of a naked man
terrorizing the hotel.

58:12.781 --> 58:15.148
He's obviously not at this table.

58:15.367 --> 58:17.074
- Mauser!
- Yes, sir.

58:17.285 --> 58:19.447
Would you take care of this naked person?

58:19.663 --> 58:22.030
Naked person, yes, sir!
I'll get right on top of him!

58:22.249 --> 58:23.581
Proctor!

58:57.451 --> 59:03.288
Well, glad to see you enjoying yourselves,
men, despite the bad news.

59:03.498 --> 59:05.034
Bad news? There's been bad news?

59:05.250 --> 59:09.210
Well, bad news for you, good news for me.

59:09.921 --> 59:12.208
Your cadets have been doing
their usual fine job...

59:12.424 --> 59:15.292
...so it looks like I've got this one
in the bag.

59:15.510 --> 59:19.299
Congratulations! I'm so happy
when someone I know wins.

59:19.514 --> 59:22.222
I always think these contests are fixed.

59:22.768 --> 59:24.100
Wait a minute.

59:24.519 --> 59:28.684
- If you're winning, then...
- You're losing. Ha, ha.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.731
Sorry to spoil your fun.

59:32.402 --> 59:34.735
- It's not fair.
- Any ideas?

59:34.946 --> 59:38.690
I could twist off Mauser's shiny head
and roll it down the street.

59:39.451 --> 59:41.659
Hold that thought, Hightower.

59:52.756 --> 59:54.418
Come on. Damn it!

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:17.570
Oh.

01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:00.362
Governor, Commissioner--

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.190
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:07.279
...may I introduce you
to a very special man, Comdt. Mauser.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:11.199
As you know, the committee's
been evaluating both of our academies...

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:13.205
...and they're very close to a decision.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.252
And you know what this man said about that?

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:16.954
It's a fact...

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.836
It's a "facahamahoma."

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.712
Does this man have a way with words?

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:24.466
He said you can't judge an academy
by rushing its cadets out into the field...

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.640
...or by seeing whose cadets
marched the straightest, no.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:31.640
Do you know what the man,
I like to call "Mr. Policeman," said?

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:34.768
"Forget any mistakes cadets
have made over the last few weeks.

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:36.099
They were just learning.

01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:39.811
It's these last days of competition
that should determine the winner."

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.943
Comdt. Mauser, I salute you.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.195
We all salute you!

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:06.758
This is the final day
of the evaluation competition...

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:11.134
...and though Comdt. Mauser's academy
is in the lead...

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:16.306
...it's how you perform today
that will determine our winner.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:20.184
Police personnel
will monitor your performance...

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.065
...at crime locations.

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:27.526
My advice is to treat this
exactly as if it were real.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:29.910
Attention!

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:32.538
Dismissed!

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:43.173
I'm going to accompany the Governor
to the charity regatta.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.752
He wants one cadet
from each academy to go with us.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:47.212
But the competition, sir.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:52.141
The Governor thought it would be nice
to evaluate cadets in a social situation.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.847
Proctor, what is this?
Hurst said one from each academy.

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:59.899
They're just as good as one man, almost.

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:10.576
The phone's got my quarter
and the operator won't give it back to me.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.449
I'll handle this, ma'am.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.533
- Operator, this is Sgt. Tackleberry.
<i>- So?</i>

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:20.916
- Please relinquish this lady's quarter.
<i>- I told her we'll send her a refund.</i>

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:22.667
You'll pay her now!

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:25.465
<i>I'm sorry, sir, would you like to speak to--?</i>

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:27.801
Stand back, ma'am.

01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:39.230
Can you identify your quarter, ma'am?

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:45.853
Sgt. Hooks, we got a 10-48 in Sector 1.

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:47.404
Send in Tackleberry.

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:51.950
Tackleberry? He's across town.
Hightower's only three blocks away.

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:53.824
Send in Tackleberry.

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:55.780
You heard him. Do it.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.732
- Sweetchuck!
- What a lobby.

01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:35.820
Secure the elevator. I'll take the stairs.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:09.607
Easy.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:15.196
Sgt. Hooks, there's a 10-48!

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:17.745
All right. Send in car 46.

01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:20.414
<i>Car 46. Car 46.</i>

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.415
<i>Hightower, there's a roving gang
in the Gower district.</i>

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:26.420
Oh, boy, this is it.

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:32.217
Right, right.

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.967
Take a left...
No, you're going towards the expressway!

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:36.342
Take a U-turn on...

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:39.592
Make a U-turn on Flint Street...

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:42.804
No, you're going towards the expressway!
What is that?

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:46.265
No, wait, make a U-turn!

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:48.441
- Where are we going?
- Just relax.

01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:58.444
Not a word.

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:03.950
--then you go around. Stop! Don't...

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:26.563
We're with the Governor at the trophy.

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.936
The purpose of the regatta, of course...

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:31.940
...is we're hoping to raise about $20,000
for my campaign.

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:33.487
I was going to--

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:36.190
- Good luck, Governor.
- We're moving toward the punch bowl.

01:06:36.367 --> 01:06:38.529
Hello, Judge. Pick a winner, huh?

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:40.031
We've stopped.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.329
- Would you back off?
- We're backing off.

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:44.411
What are you trying to do, injure him?

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:47.164
Comdt. Mauser's cadets
never abandon their posts, sir!

01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:49.210
Unlike some cadets I might mention, sir!

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.532
Holy cow!

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:29.326
Mahoney.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:32.084
Mahoney, somebody, I need help.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:33.922
<i>I need help.</i>

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:39.383
Listen, the busboys...

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.714
...are shooting my nose.

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:44.675
<i>Did you read that? Was that for real?</i>

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.476
We heard it. Sir?

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:49.396
- Maybe we better check it out.
- What about the evaluation?

01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:52.645
One of my boys may be in trouble.
Screw the evaluation.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:55.022
I love it when you talk dirty, sir.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:57.605
Mahoney must think he's as dumb as we are.

01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:00.316
- We're not gonna fall for that stuff.
- Yeah.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:03.528
He must be getting desperate,
trying to sucker us with that crap.

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:09.908
Go.

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:12.962
ROBBER 1
Come on, let's go. Come on.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:16.506
Get your hands in the air. It's a stickup!

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:21.049
If there was trouble,
Baxter would let us know.

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:23.095
Take them, boys.

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:26.182
Don't you touch that.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.803
No, not the one for bravery.

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:05.260
There's the Yacht Club.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.139
How are we gonna get there, Sergeant?

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:14.727
How do you look in a wet suit?

01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:17.399
Hand over your money and jewels
and nobody gets hurt!

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:19.732
You'll never get away with this.
I'm the Governor.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:23.111
The Governor? Did you hear that, boys?
We got the Governor.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:24.316
Hooray!

01:09:24.535 --> 01:09:26.743
You must be breaking your mother's heart.

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:29.617
Why don't you ask her?
She's right over there.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:31.948
Hi.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.410
- Oh, yeah. She looks like you.
- Hmm?

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.776
Gather our boys. We got trouble coming!

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:29.427
Spread out, spread out. Spread.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.636
I can't get Baxter.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:34.721
Something's going on at the marina.
Right over there. Take the next right.

01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:54.873
Just relax.
You've got the right to remain silent.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.208
- You passed it.
- They're not yielding.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.786
- Pull over to the right.
- Yield!

01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:00.746
You're missing it. There goes the right.

01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:03.002
We're in a police car
and they're not yielding.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.716
Move!

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:18.396
- Stop. Hold it.
- Mahoney!

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:20.520
Police officer. Stop right there!

01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:30.109
Karen, I'm going after the Governor.

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:37.958
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:40.536
- You do look good in a wet suit.
- So do you.

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:57.686
Freeze!

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:00.806
Drop it!

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:07.487
Go ahead. Make my day...

01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:09.276
...punk!

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.196
Freeze, cop!

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:18.665
Uh-oh. Trouble.

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:32.171
Banzai!

01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:42.973
Yeah.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:01.329
I didn't mean to hit you.

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.830
I hate you. I hate you.

01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:35.613
Hey. Pull over.

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:42.032
Mahoney, you all right?

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.584
I'm okay. Just keep going.

01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:51.753
Hey.

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:55.174
Get out of my way, old man.

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:06.060
Mahoney's in trouble. Let's go!

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.733
You got it. Oh!

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:19.387
Proctor, you're an idiot.

01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:22.557
You were born an idiot,
you'll always be an idiot.

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:42.243
Dive.

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:49.719
Whoa!

01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:51.808
Yahoo!

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:57.436
Move it, Proctor.

01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:00.022
I got this side,
you paddle on the other side.

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:01.857
Uh-oh. Oh. Hey, hey, hey!

01:17:02.076 --> 01:17:03.317
Hold it!

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:05.027
- Hey!
- No, no, no!

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:11.074
You okay, sir?

01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:22.837
Aah! Look out.

01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:03.092
Let's talk. Ha!

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:31.158
- You okay?
- You need help?

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:35.370
- Where's the Governor?
- Governor!

01:18:38.339 --> 01:18:40.626
Don't move, dirtbag!

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:48.592
All right! Can we go again?

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:11.161
I'd like to thank the members
of my racing team for their assistance.

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:12.362
I couldn't have won...

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:17.076
--without the help
of my many wonderful instructors...

01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:19.832
...and my many fine cadets.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.331
Thanks to all...

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:27.510
...this academy
will carry on its fine tradition.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:39.014
Ha!
