24:10.208 --> 24:15.333
♪ Sky could be blue as can be… ♪

24:15.416 --> 24:17.500
[Caleb]
I guess it really is a small island.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.208
[chuckles]

24:20.833 --> 24:22.291
How did you find me?

24:23.083 --> 24:24.166
Uh, I didn't.

24:25.208 --> 24:26.458
My brother's wedding is here.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.625
-[laughs]
-[Caleb chuckles]

24:30.625 --> 24:31.791
Of course. [splutters]

24:31.875 --> 24:35.666
I mean, not just… you're not just
running around looking for me.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.958
Actually, I was gonna call
every hotel in town

24:38.041 --> 24:40.083
asking if they had a singer named Erica.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.291
No, you weren't.

24:41.375 --> 24:42.750
I would have found you.

24:44.416 --> 24:47.458
Oh, and right there
is the happy couple now.

24:48.291 --> 24:49.125
[chuckles]

24:52.500 --> 24:55.250
Oh, wow, you are very strong.

24:55.333 --> 24:56.583
Wait, you're Caleb King?

24:57.083 --> 24:59.041
-What? How do you--
-[spluttering]

24:59.125 --> 25:02.625
Jason mentioned his military brother
for years, but we never met.

25:05.541 --> 25:07.000
You're that Erica?

25:07.666 --> 25:08.500
Jason's Erica?

25:08.583 --> 25:09.708
Not anymore.

25:09.791 --> 25:11.750
Yo, Caleb! We're taking the tour?

25:11.833 --> 25:14.583
Ooh, you can bring your little friend
if you want-- Oh my God.

25:14.666 --> 25:16.791
What-- What are you doing?
She can't be here. What--

25:16.875 --> 25:18.625
-Hello Christian.
-She works here.

25:20.666 --> 25:21.791
-No.
-[Caleb] Yes.

25:21.875 --> 25:23.541
-No.
-[Caleb] Yes.

25:23.625 --> 25:25.791
-Yeah. I work here.
-Yeah.

25:26.458 --> 25:27.625
-[Erica] Yeah.
-Uh-huh.

25:28.416 --> 25:30.041
And the gift bags are stored where?

25:30.125 --> 25:32.958
The gift bags are stored
in a staging area--

25:33.041 --> 25:35.500
Baby, they have it handled. It's true.

25:35.583 --> 25:36.875
Oh, and here comes my sister.

25:36.958 --> 25:39.833
…down-home southern lady.
So when I say 100% of the packaging

25:39.916 --> 25:43.208
needs to be re-plantable seedlings,
I mean it.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.791
All right, bye.
Okay, what's the next leg of the tour?

25:45.875 --> 25:48.750
-We are waiting on the rest of your party.
-Oh, they're right over there.

25:50.666 --> 25:51.833
With…

25:53.541 --> 25:54.500
Erica?

25:54.583 --> 25:58.291
Yes. Erica.
She will be singing at your wedding.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.291
Oh my God.

25:59.375 --> 26:01.125
-Baby, you're leaking papaya.
-Oh.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.208
[both chuckle]

26:02.291 --> 26:04.208
Wait, how do--
how do you know the wedding singer?

26:04.291 --> 26:05.333
We, uh…

26:05.916 --> 26:07.375
We know Erica from New York.

26:07.458 --> 26:08.333
What?

26:08.416 --> 26:10.500
-Wait, what a small world.
-[sister] No way.

26:10.583 --> 26:12.583
-[bride] Look at you.
-[Jason] Come on.

26:12.666 --> 26:13.666
[bride chuckles]

26:13.750 --> 26:15.541
Erica! [laughs nervously]

26:15.625 --> 26:17.166
What a surprise.

26:17.666 --> 26:19.041
Please don't say anything.

26:19.125 --> 26:23.833
Hey, so, what are you doing here,
so far away from where you normally are?

26:23.916 --> 26:26.541
I-- I'm here singing. Um…

26:26.625 --> 26:29.583
I think what brings you here
is way more interesting.

26:32.125 --> 26:33.166
[chuckles nervously]

26:34.000 --> 26:36.166
-Uh, well, Erica, this is…
-Yes, this is--

26:36.250 --> 26:38.375
-I'm Beverly, Jason's fiancée.
-Mm-hmm.

26:38.458 --> 26:40.166
-Erica.
-Nice to meet you.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.833
-Uh--
-She and Jason--

26:41.916 --> 26:44.166
-Yeah, we-- this, uh--
-You know each other from New York?

26:44.250 --> 26:46.083
-Right.
-Yeah. I see you know Christian, too.

26:46.166 --> 26:47.208
Hmm.

26:47.291 --> 26:49.916
-[chuckles]
-We all used to live in the same building.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.375
Yes! We got to know each other from, uh…
[splutters] …when it was the club.

26:54.458 --> 26:55.458
[Christian spluttering]

26:55.541 --> 26:57.250
-[Jason] Yeah. Yeah.
-A club?

26:57.333 --> 26:59.458
-Yeah, it was a--
-Right, it wasn't really a dance club.

26:59.541 --> 27:01.958
No. It was-- It was--
It was a-- It was a book club.

27:02.458 --> 27:03.416
-Yeah.
-[Christian] Yeah.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.791
What luck running into Erica.

27:04.875 --> 27:08.375
You don't often find employees
in the lobby unless they are working.

27:08.458 --> 27:09.875
It's such a treat that you're here.

27:09.958 --> 27:12.875
I never get to meet Jason's friends,
'cause you guys are all up in New York.

27:12.958 --> 27:15.791
And we've been so swamped.
Can't get out of Charleston…

27:15.875 --> 27:18.666
-[chuckles]
-Oh, right. You moved to Charleston.

27:19.708 --> 27:21.625
I was the first person he met
when he moved there,

27:21.708 --> 27:23.250
right across the hall from me.

27:23.333 --> 27:25.666
Wow, first person, huh?

27:25.750 --> 27:28.166
-Wasn't that, like, a year ago?
-[chuckles nervously]

27:28.250 --> 27:31.250
But didn't give you a lot of time
to plan a wedding, huh?

27:31.333 --> 27:33.666
-Ha!
-No, he didn't. But I-- I don't need it.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.875
We just wanted it to be really intimate.
So, for me, that's me, my sister Janelle,

27:36.958 --> 27:39.416
and, uh, Jason's parents are coming,
a few of our friends,

27:39.500 --> 27:41.375
but that's it. That's all we needed.

27:41.458 --> 27:43.166
That is so sweet.

27:43.250 --> 27:47.166
Hey, um, why don't you take, uh, Janelle
to the spa,

27:47.250 --> 27:50.166
and I'll come meet you
for cell regeneration time.

27:50.250 --> 27:51.750
-[Beverly] Thank you.
-[both kiss]

27:51.833 --> 27:54.500
Okay, okay, yes,
it was so good to meet you.

27:54.583 --> 27:57.125
Come on, Janelle, wanna show me
your secret plans for the weekend?

27:57.208 --> 27:58.625
-Okay, bye. Okay, bye.
-Bye.

27:59.750 --> 28:01.041
[Beverly giggles]

28:01.125 --> 28:01.958
How could you?

28:02.666 --> 28:05.083
[grunts]
I can't believe you're getting married.

28:05.166 --> 28:06.458
I can't believe you're here!

28:06.541 --> 28:08.500
What are you even--
What are you doing here?

28:08.583 --> 28:11.166
Amber does social media for this resort.

28:11.250 --> 28:12.291
They needed a singer.

28:12.375 --> 28:14.833
No wonder I kept gettin' ads
about this place.

28:14.916 --> 28:17.208
Wait. What happened with Cre
and the album?

28:17.791 --> 28:19.458
Cre scrapped it.

28:19.541 --> 28:23.208
Someone leaked one of the tracks,
and he just destroyed the whole thing,

28:23.291 --> 28:24.541
along with my career.

28:26.458 --> 28:27.583
Yeah, I'm sorry.

28:28.416 --> 28:29.750
I didn't know.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.416
Yeah, me too.

28:33.791 --> 28:37.000
But if Beverly finds out we were engaged,
it'll cause so many problems.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.833
-So please just--
-Wait, she doesn't know?

28:39.916 --> 28:43.333
[spluttering] I could--
I could never seem to find the right time.

28:43.416 --> 28:46.291
You know, I guess it's never really
a good time to tell your new fiancée

28:46.375 --> 28:49.291
how you walked out on your old fiancée
a month before the wedding.

28:49.375 --> 28:51.208
Wait a minute.
I didn't walk out on you, okay?

28:51.291 --> 28:54.583
You walked out every single day
to the studio.

28:54.666 --> 28:57.458
And you know what? By the time
the job offer came up in Charleston,

28:57.541 --> 28:59.416
there wasn't a relationship
to even walk out on.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.333
What? So you leave without talking to me,
and I'm the bad guy?

29:02.416 --> 29:04.083
Listen, you were never there to--

29:05.166 --> 29:07.541
-You know what? Rehashing this--
-[scoffs] Rehash?

29:07.625 --> 29:10.291
[chuckles] Oh no. You know--
You know what? It was never hashed.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.625
You were just gone.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.000
Okay. [claps hands]

29:13.083 --> 29:13.958
[chuckles]

29:14.041 --> 29:16.833
I did not do 48 hours
of therapy for this, okay?

29:16.916 --> 29:18.125
-[inhales deeply]
-Hmm.

29:18.208 --> 29:19.708
-We're here for a few days.
-Mm-hmm.

29:19.791 --> 29:21.458
We can avoid each other. Easy.

29:21.541 --> 29:23.791
Yeah, mm-hmm. Don't expect me to sing
at your wedding.

29:23.875 --> 29:26.291
Good. I don't. Tell 'em you're sick
or something. Call in.

29:26.375 --> 29:28.750
-I will gladly do that.
-Well, good!

29:30.125 --> 29:33.541
-But you won't tell Beverly, right?
-[yells] Go, go, go, go!

29:33.625 --> 29:34.458
[sighs]

29:37.083 --> 29:38.708
-[Barrington] Morning.
-[screams]

29:39.416 --> 29:41.250
-Hi.
-[sighs]

29:41.333 --> 29:43.333
Did you just hear that?

29:43.416 --> 29:46.666
[spluttering] There's an echo in here,
so, uh, I heard it.

29:47.375 --> 29:48.208
Twice.

29:49.333 --> 29:51.500
I guess you know now why I hate weddings.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.708
Erica, why didn't you just tell us?

29:55.541 --> 29:56.375
[sighs]

29:57.250 --> 29:58.750
I didn't want to relive it.

30:01.583 --> 30:04.375
[Christian laughing]

30:09.708 --> 30:12.750
-Does she really work here?
-Dude, Amber does--

30:13.791 --> 30:14.875
It's not funny, man!

30:14.958 --> 30:17.041
-What are you gonna tell Beverly?
-[Jason] Nothin'.

30:17.625 --> 30:20.541
Beverly finds out I was engaged
to Erica, she will lose it.

30:20.625 --> 30:23.500
Okay, then, you gotta come clean.
Look, if you get caught lyin'--

30:23.583 --> 30:25.125
Okay, listen, I know you mean well,

30:25.208 --> 30:27.750
but I don't need the Honor-Duty
Captain America speech right now.

30:27.833 --> 30:29.750
-Wow, Captain America?
-Okay?

30:31.041 --> 30:32.375
Wasn't Special Forces.

30:32.458 --> 30:33.500
Ooh.

30:33.583 --> 30:34.583
All I'm sayin'

30:34.666 --> 30:38.833
is perfect honesty isn't always possible
in 24-7 civilian life.

30:38.916 --> 30:40.041
Hmm, yep.

30:40.125 --> 30:42.416
And no one is expecting you to be perfect,

30:44.375 --> 30:45.291
just honest.

30:45.375 --> 30:49.208
And sometimes, keeping things to yourself
is the best way to go.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.625
[sighs]

30:51.708 --> 30:54.958
Otherwise,
I'll end up with two ex-fiancées.

30:55.666 --> 30:58.958
I wonder if I should try
for a wedding commission from the hotel

30:59.041 --> 31:00.708
since they found it through me.

31:01.208 --> 31:02.875
-Amber!
-I'm sorry.

31:02.958 --> 31:04.875
This is not about business.

31:04.958 --> 31:08.083
Look, I'll-- I'll conveniently come down
with a cold the day of his wedding.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.541
In the meantime,
we'll just avoid each other.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.333
What? This is a good, sane plan.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.000
Look, I gotta get ready for work.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.916
It's a big resort. It can't be that hard.

31:21.375 --> 31:24.291
Erica! Girl, hey! [chuckles]

31:24.375 --> 31:25.916
Fancy runnin' into you.

31:26.416 --> 31:27.666
Yes. [chuckles]

31:27.750 --> 31:31.583
You know, it's-- it's too bad.
I'm actually running late for, um…

31:31.666 --> 31:34.083
The meeting about the music,
the wedding music?

31:34.750 --> 31:37.000
Right. That's right now.

31:37.083 --> 31:39.541
-Yes, right now.
-Yes, girl, come on. We'll go find Jason.

31:40.583 --> 31:43.958
He's around here somewhere.
It is such serendipity that you're here.

31:44.041 --> 31:46.000
Yeah. That's definitely a word for it.

31:46.083 --> 31:49.416
I gotta tell you. I-- I was so worried
Jason was missing his life in New York,

31:49.500 --> 31:51.125
so to have you here is just--

31:51.708 --> 31:54.500
[gasps] Oh, wait, you should come hiking
with us tomorrow.

31:54.583 --> 31:58.375
Oh no. You know, I'm--
I'm not much of a hiker. I-- Bad arches.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.041
Oh, no, girl, please. It'll be fun.

32:00.125 --> 32:03.958
We usually discourage employees
from fraternizing with the guests.

32:04.041 --> 32:06.208
Resort rules. Right. Sorry.

32:06.291 --> 32:10.000
But guest wishes always come first,
and I would hate to put two friends apart.

32:10.083 --> 32:11.291
Yes, thank you!

32:11.375 --> 32:14.583
-We-- We're more like book club members.
-No. Thank you.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.458
Bonne journée, Erica.

32:16.541 --> 32:17.625
[footsteps receding]

32:19.375 --> 32:22.791
So, Beverly tells me you don't have
your wedding song yet? Really?

32:22.875 --> 32:24.833
Perhaps I can make a suggestion.

32:24.916 --> 32:26.041
-Oh please.
-Yeah?

32:26.125 --> 32:31.625
Okay, great. How about
"Unbreak My Heart" by Toni Braxton.

32:32.708 --> 32:35.500
-Uh, for a wedding?
-Mm. Mm-hmm. Yep.

32:35.583 --> 32:39.875
Or, what about "Irreplaceable" by Beyoncé?

32:40.500 --> 32:43.250
[chuckles]
Uh, girl, that's a breakup song.

32:43.333 --> 32:44.291
Mm.

32:44.375 --> 32:47.583
-I've always loved "Diamonds" by Rihanna.
-Yeah!

32:47.666 --> 32:49.416
-Mm.
-Yeah, I like that.

32:49.500 --> 32:53.291
Wait! Wait!
You know what will be a really good one?

32:54.041 --> 32:56.083
"No One" by Alicia Keys.

32:58.458 --> 32:59.416
-Yeah.
-[Jason] Yeah?

33:00.291 --> 33:01.125
Why?

33:01.625 --> 33:03.916
Well, when you first moved in
across the hall from me,

33:04.000 --> 33:05.875
you used to play that song on repeat,

33:05.958 --> 33:07.208
and so loud. [chuckles]

33:07.291 --> 33:10.208
I found myself humming it
before I met you, which…

33:10.916 --> 33:12.208
I don't know, feels like a sign.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.250
-Does it?
-Yeah.

33:13.333 --> 33:17.208
'Cause, I kinda liked your first instinct,
Rihanna, "Diamonds," better.

33:17.291 --> 33:19.125
Aw, baby, you do?

33:19.208 --> 33:20.791
-Yeah.
-Mm.

33:23.375 --> 33:26.375
[giggling] So sweet. Oh…

33:26.458 --> 33:27.875
Yeah. Oh!

33:27.958 --> 33:32.166
So we're settled. We got our wedding song.
So, how many more of these we gotta pick?

33:32.250 --> 33:34.708
Oh, do you mind if we, uh, pick the rest

59:12.041 --> 59:13.833
-Although they are not.
-[both laugh]

59:14.666 --> 59:15.583
Amen to that.

59:16.083 --> 59:19.375
That actually needs to be official.
I think I wanna legislate that one day.

59:19.458 --> 59:22.333
[Erica laughs] I'm-- I'm sure you will.

59:22.416 --> 59:24.833
-Okay [laughing].
-[Erica] Okay.

59:24.916 --> 59:29.500
Oh shit! My name is Beverly Strattford,
and I approve this message. Okay?

59:29.583 --> 59:31.000
Right. Yes, girl. [grunts]

59:31.083 --> 59:32.416
Oh, man.

59:33.125 --> 59:35.333
Ooh. Ooh.

59:35.416 --> 59:38.291
-I'm gonna leave this here, just in case.
-Mm-hmm.

59:38.375 --> 59:39.583
-Okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

59:39.666 --> 59:43.166
-All right. You sure you're okay?
-I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

59:43.708 --> 59:44.750
-[phone chimes]
-Mm.

59:46.125 --> 59:46.958
[blips]

59:47.958 --> 59:49.375
Was that your phone or mine?

59:50.416 --> 59:52.166
-Mine.
-Oh…

59:52.250 --> 59:54.375
Who's texting you this late, Ms. Erica?

59:55.625 --> 59:58.375
Just one of the band
confirming rehearsal tomorrow.

59:58.458 --> 1:00:00.708
Oh, will I see you
at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow?

1:00:00.791 --> 1:00:01.750
-Uh…
-[squeals]

1:00:01.833 --> 1:00:03.083
I have to work.

1:00:03.875 --> 1:00:08.541
[smacks lips]
Well, then I will see you at the wedding!

1:00:08.625 --> 1:00:10.041
-[giggles]
-Okay.

1:00:12.083 --> 1:00:12.916
Oh, Erica.

1:00:14.083 --> 1:00:19.083
Girl, I'm so happy I met you.
I really feel like we're becoming friends.

1:00:19.708 --> 1:00:20.708
[chuckles softly]

1:00:23.208 --> 1:00:24.041
Good night.

1:00:25.958 --> 1:00:27.250
[chuckles]

1:00:28.083 --> 1:00:30.458
Oh… [sighs]

1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:36.333
-[clicks]
-[tapping]

1:00:39.125 --> 1:00:40.041
[blips]

1:01:03.583 --> 1:01:04.750
[footsteps approaching]

1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:06.333
[gasps softly]

1:01:06.916 --> 1:01:07.750
Hey.

1:01:09.916 --> 1:01:10.875
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:01:11.375 --> 1:01:14.875
Uh, what are you--
What are you doing out here?

1:01:16.875 --> 1:01:18.708
-What are you doing here?
-[chuckles]

1:01:19.333 --> 1:01:24.041
Well, it is finally cool enough
to go for a run. So… here I am.

1:01:30.791 --> 1:01:33.083
I like to meditate
at this time of the night.

1:01:34.458 --> 1:01:35.458
Oh.

1:01:36.791 --> 1:01:38.416
[Erica] How was the bachelor party?

1:01:38.500 --> 1:01:41.541
Well, we just smoked cigars,

1:01:41.625 --> 1:01:44.625
and sat by an infinity pool,

1:01:44.708 --> 1:01:46.416
and drank overpriced whiskey.

1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:48.666
-[both chuckle]
-How was your thing?

1:01:49.291 --> 1:01:50.291
Mine was…

1:01:52.041 --> 1:01:53.916
It was actually fun. I have to admit.

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.625
-[chuckles]
-Jason left us early.

1:01:56.916 --> 1:02:00.958
Said he had to go work, but probably
just snuck off to be with Beverly.

1:02:02.625 --> 1:02:03.458
Hmm.

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.500
So, do you wanna go meditate?

1:02:11.666 --> 1:02:12.500
[chuckles]

1:02:13.625 --> 1:02:15.666
Ah, let's-- let's give it a try.

1:02:17.083 --> 1:02:18.416
Okay. After you.

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:27.833
[Erica laughing]

1:02:28.375 --> 1:02:32.125
-No, I can't believe that. Okay, this one.
-Uh…

1:02:32.208 --> 1:02:33.500
Believe it or not…

1:02:34.791 --> 1:02:37.541
-The trombone.
-[laughs] I knew you would say that.

1:02:37.625 --> 1:02:39.375
All right, how about this one?

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.458
Yeah, that is the scar
that changed my entire life.

1:02:45.041 --> 1:02:47.416
-I blew it out on my last mission.
-Oh.

1:02:48.166 --> 1:02:51.208
And just like that,
the only life that I know-- I-- [sighs]

1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:53.416
I knew,

1:02:54.500 --> 1:02:55.541
really is gone.

1:02:58.250 --> 1:03:00.500
Not many people
can see those types of scars.

1:03:00.583 --> 1:03:02.625
Hmm. [chuckles] True.

1:03:04.166 --> 1:03:08.041
I look at that scar and think to myself,
it has put me on a path,

1:03:08.125 --> 1:03:10.041
and I don't know where it's gonna lead.

1:03:10.125 --> 1:03:10.958
Hmm.

1:03:11.958 --> 1:03:14.666
No one is coming to pick me up
to take me to my next mission.

1:03:16.875 --> 1:03:20.625
And I keep imagining my family and…

1:03:20.708 --> 1:03:22.208
[chuckles] …everyone…

1:03:24.166 --> 1:03:26.458
expecting me to know
what I'm gonna do next, but…

1:03:27.666 --> 1:03:28.500
I don't.

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.208
And for the first time in my life, I have

1:03:32.750 --> 1:03:33.583
no plan.

1:03:37.041 --> 1:03:38.375
Maybe you should own that.

1:03:40.250 --> 1:03:43.541
Yeah. Don't worry about
what everybody expects of you.

1:03:45.083 --> 1:03:47.083
I don't know how to do that.

1:03:47.166 --> 1:03:48.125
[both chuckle]

1:03:48.708 --> 1:03:49.541
Hmm.

1:03:50.708 --> 1:03:51.708
Neither do I.

1:03:51.791 --> 1:03:52.666
I guess.

1:03:54.875 --> 1:03:59.166
[sighs] It's harder trying to get over
what you expect of yourself.

1:04:00.083 --> 1:04:01.333
Yeah, that's the one.

1:04:02.125 --> 1:04:06.083
'Cause I definitely expected
that album would be my big break.

1:04:06.166 --> 1:04:08.208
Hmm. [tsks]

1:04:08.625 --> 1:04:09.875
-[sighs]
-I'm sorry.

1:04:12.916 --> 1:04:14.166
I'm not sure that I am.

1:04:16.666 --> 1:04:20.166
But I do know
that the music is still with me.

1:04:21.291 --> 1:04:22.958
And though I have no plan…

1:04:24.250 --> 1:04:26.375
[sighs] …I know I'm meant to sing.

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:28.916
That's why God gave me this voice.

1:04:33.291 --> 1:04:36.458
Well, you can't argue with God.

1:04:36.958 --> 1:04:38.041
No.

1:04:38.125 --> 1:04:40.625
Especially not
when he makes a sunrise like that.

1:04:45.333 --> 1:04:46.416
[Erica] Wow.

1:04:47.041 --> 1:04:49.458
Okay, I… [clears throat]
…should go get some sleep

1:04:49.541 --> 1:04:50.875
before my parents get here.

1:04:50.958 --> 1:04:52.958
Seeing my mom
for the first time in a few years

1:04:53.041 --> 1:04:55.416
requires at least four hours.

1:04:55.500 --> 1:04:56.500
[chuckles] Oh wow.

1:05:00.166 --> 1:05:01.958
-Um, I'm gonna go…
-Yeah.

1:05:02.041 --> 1:05:02.875
…hide.

1:05:02.958 --> 1:05:04.208
See you later.

1:05:04.291 --> 1:05:07.083
-Before your mom sees me. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

1:05:07.166 --> 1:05:09.500
-Then the sand's gonna hit the fan.
-[chuckles]

1:05:10.250 --> 1:05:11.375
-All right.
-Yeah.

1:05:11.458 --> 1:05:12.708
-Good night!
-See you later.

1:05:12.791 --> 1:05:13.833
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:05:22.125 --> 1:05:24.125
[tense music]

1:05:25.666 --> 1:05:26.875
[indistinct chattering]

1:05:28.875 --> 1:05:29.708
[Naomi] Hmm.

1:05:31.625 --> 1:05:32.666
Mm-hmm.

1:05:33.708 --> 1:05:35.166
[chuckles nervously]

1:05:36.458 --> 1:05:37.791
I've got to be real.

1:05:38.375 --> 1:05:40.291
Today's a very difficult day for me.

1:05:41.291 --> 1:05:42.541
I'm losing my baby.

1:05:42.625 --> 1:05:44.500
My blanket in the shade.

1:05:44.583 --> 1:05:45.958
Oh, Mom!

1:05:46.041 --> 1:05:49.583
I used to use his little body
as a shawl on picnics.

1:05:50.166 --> 1:05:52.083
-Okay.
-[chuckles]

1:05:52.166 --> 1:05:54.083
And it's been cold without him.

1:05:57.250 --> 1:06:00.958
Attention! Attention. Attention, everyone!

1:06:01.041 --> 1:06:02.500
Oh God. Oh no.

1:06:02.583 --> 1:06:04.125
Attention, everyone!

1:06:05.708 --> 1:06:07.083
There's something I have to say.

1:06:07.833 --> 1:06:08.833
Okay.

1:06:09.416 --> 1:06:10.625
I'm losing my baby…

1:06:11.166 --> 1:06:12.375
Come on, say it. Say it.

1:06:13.875 --> 1:06:15.833
…to a siren's call.

1:06:15.916 --> 1:06:17.541
-What?
-Oh, Jesus!

1:06:17.625 --> 1:06:19.416
And in times like these,

1:06:19.500 --> 1:06:21.583
I turn to Bette Midler
for the right words.

1:06:21.666 --> 1:06:22.541
Oh no!

1:06:22.625 --> 1:06:24.958
What does Bette Midler have
to do with anything?

1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.250
[Caleb] You've given these people
enough of your gift.

Uh-uh. We cannot be stingy with our songs
of love and devotion, baby.

1:07:19.083 --> 1:07:21.666
I know, but it's my turn to toast Jason.

1:07:22.416 --> 1:07:25.125
And I've really
been looking forward to it.

1:07:26.083 --> 1:07:27.958
Oh, oh, well, for you, baby.

1:07:28.041 --> 1:07:28.958
For you.

1:07:31.250 --> 1:07:34.458
[clears throat] Hello, everyone.

1:07:34.541 --> 1:07:36.250
I am Caleb King,

1:07:37.041 --> 1:07:38.166
Jason's older brother.

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.458
Now, I don't--
I don't know much about relationships.

1:07:42.416 --> 1:07:47.041
I've never been married, but I know what
it's like to be committed wholeheartedly.

1:07:47.875 --> 1:07:50.708
And that is what you two
are about to do tomorrow.

1:07:51.208 --> 1:07:52.416
Commitment is

1:07:54.208 --> 1:07:55.625
an active breathing thing.

1:07:56.375 --> 1:07:58.458
Too many people walk away easily…

1:08:00.916 --> 1:08:02.125
give up easily.

1:08:02.958 --> 1:08:07.250
But the strength and love that it takes
to choose commitment,

1:08:07.333 --> 1:08:09.708
well, that…
that is something to look up to.

1:08:11.583 --> 1:08:12.416
And I do.

1:08:18.041 --> 1:08:19.250
So… [clears throat]

1:08:20.125 --> 1:08:22.625
…from everyone at this table,

1:08:23.291 --> 1:08:26.458
congratulations, Beverly and Jason.

1:08:27.208 --> 1:08:28.041
[all] Cheers!

1:08:28.125 --> 1:08:29.500
-Thank you.
-[Jason] Cheers.

1:08:38.250 --> 1:08:39.083
[clears throat]

1:08:46.416 --> 1:08:47.375
[knocking at door]

1:08:48.750 --> 1:08:49.583
[sighs]

1:08:53.125 --> 1:08:56.083
You should really ask who's there
before you open the door.

1:08:56.958 --> 1:08:57.791
[chuckles]

1:08:58.916 --> 1:09:00.125
What are you doing here?

1:09:00.791 --> 1:09:02.958
It's over.

1:09:03.041 --> 1:09:05.375
-Jason called off the wedding?
-What?

1:09:05.958 --> 1:09:07.916
No. The rehearsal dinner.

1:09:11.083 --> 1:09:12.166
But… [sighs]

1:09:13.416 --> 1:09:15.000
…I think he's having cold feet.

1:09:16.708 --> 1:09:18.958
So I figured I'd keep watch.

1:09:22.041 --> 1:09:23.708
In case he tries anything stupid.

1:09:25.458 --> 1:09:27.583
What do you mean by s-- stupid? [chuckles]

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:32.708
-You have another one of those?
-[both laughing]

1:09:32.791 --> 1:09:35.875
Okay, "Wind Beneath My Wings"
is actually a good choice,

1:09:35.958 --> 1:09:40.083
but I would take Naomi for more
of a "I Will Always Love You."

1:09:40.166 --> 1:09:41.833
Yeah. That kinda mother-in-law.

1:09:41.916 --> 1:09:43.750
Just a little bit more menacing.

1:09:43.833 --> 1:09:45.708
-[laughs]
-Yeah, with a headscarf.

1:09:45.791 --> 1:09:49.333
Running off the plane like Whitney
at the end of The Bodyguard.

1:09:50.750 --> 1:09:53.833
-She has one of those headscarves, too.
-Yes, I bet.

1:09:55.333 --> 1:09:57.250
I bet you're glad you don't have
to deal with her?

1:09:58.083 --> 1:09:58.916
Maybe.

1:10:00.125 --> 1:10:03.250
Or… [sighs]
…maybe I would have grown to like her.

1:10:03.750 --> 1:10:04.791
You would have.

1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:06.875
I mean, look, she's

1:10:07.875 --> 1:10:08.791
crazy…

1:10:08.875 --> 1:10:09.958
[both chuckle]

1:10:10.041 --> 1:10:12.958
…but all that drama
is just how she knows how to show love.

1:10:13.458 --> 1:10:14.291
You know?

1:10:16.916 --> 1:10:19.666
Yeah. I guess things
could definitely be worse.

1:10:19.750 --> 1:10:20.666
Mm-hmm.

1:10:20.750 --> 1:10:21.750
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:10:24.041 --> 1:10:25.333
You mind if I take these off?

1:10:27.416 --> 1:10:30.875
Oh, so you really are staying, aren't you?

1:10:31.625 --> 1:10:32.750
That is the plan.

1:10:38.791 --> 1:10:39.625
Hmm.

1:10:40.541 --> 1:10:42.791
You were expecting Jason, weren't you?

1:10:48.541 --> 1:10:49.625
I don't know.

1:10:49.708 --> 1:10:50.958
-Hmm.
-Maybe.

1:10:54.125 --> 1:10:55.333
You want me to leave?

1:11:06.166 --> 1:11:07.333
No, not really.

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.125
[inhales sharply]

1:11:14.750 --> 1:11:15.666
You know what…

1:11:17.750 --> 1:11:18.958
always cheers me up?

1:11:19.625 --> 1:11:21.166
-[man yelling]
-[metal clashing]

1:11:21.250 --> 1:11:22.208
[chuckles]

1:11:22.291 --> 1:11:24.458
Okay, samurai movies
are what cheer you up?

1:11:24.541 --> 1:11:25.875
Yeah. Sure do.

1:11:25.958 --> 1:11:27.583
All right. Okay.

1:11:27.666 --> 1:11:28.833
[both laugh]

1:11:28.916 --> 1:11:31.708
All right. So there's one guy.
He pulls out a sword on another guy.

1:11:31.791 --> 1:11:35.083
And then they clash steel, and then what?

1:11:36.083 --> 1:11:37.583
-What happens?
-[laughs]

1:11:37.666 --> 1:11:40.375
I mean, how does that guy know
he's slicing up the right guy?

1:11:40.458 --> 1:11:43.083
Well, see, they have a code of honor
that they live by.

1:11:45.041 --> 1:11:47.708
-Well, okay, I wish life was that easy.
-Mm.

1:11:48.291 --> 1:11:49.916
-Well…
-[both sigh]

1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.416
…it's not supposed to be.

1:11:52.041 --> 1:11:56.166
I mean, look,
the most interesting samurais,

1:11:56.250 --> 1:11:57.583
the ones you root for,

1:11:58.708 --> 1:11:59.916
are complicated heroes.

1:12:00.958 --> 1:12:03.083
[yelling, clash of steel continues on TV]

1:12:07.625 --> 1:12:08.708
[both chuckle]

1:12:15.625 --> 1:12:16.791
-Hey!
-Hey.

1:12:16.875 --> 1:12:19.083
-I thought you were in your sister's room.
-I was.

1:12:19.166 --> 1:12:22.166
-Wait. Where are you going?
-I was just gettin' some air.

1:12:24.166 --> 1:12:25.291
Okay. Um…

1:12:26.208 --> 1:12:27.875
-Can I…
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:12:29.041 --> 1:12:32.500
Baby, I'm sorry I didn't believe you
when you said your parents were a lot.

1:12:34.166 --> 1:12:37.000
And I'm so sorry
that I was so cranky at dinner.

1:12:38.458 --> 1:12:39.333
Um…

1:12:40.916 --> 1:12:42.875
I wanna marry you
more than anything in the world,

1:12:44.708 --> 1:12:45.666
but I can't lie.

1:12:47.583 --> 1:12:49.166
Baby, I'm nerv-- I'm nervous.

1:12:50.583 --> 1:12:52.416
[softly] Hey. Hey.

1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:53.500
I'm nervous, too.

1:12:56.583 --> 1:12:59.708
-Really?
-Yeah, so nervous.

1:13:03.041 --> 1:13:06.958
Okay, I mean,
maybe we can just be nervous together.

1:13:11.125 --> 1:13:11.958
Deal.

1:13:12.958 --> 1:13:13.916
[chuckles]

1:13:15.625 --> 1:13:16.458
Oh.

1:13:19.958 --> 1:13:21.166
[gong echoes]

1:13:30.666 --> 1:13:31.708
[both sigh]

1:13:33.041 --> 1:13:34.125
-You asleep?
-[groans]

1:13:36.791 --> 1:13:38.416
-I was.
-[groans]

1:13:41.208 --> 1:13:42.833
-[Caleb groans]
-[inhales deeply]

1:13:43.416 --> 1:13:44.250
[groans]

1:13:46.208 --> 1:13:47.333
Thank you for staying.

1:13:50.166 --> 1:13:51.000
Of course.

1:13:55.125 --> 1:13:58.000
-[inhales] We should get some sleep.
-All right. Yep.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:00.833
Um…

1:14:00.916 --> 1:14:03.416
Um, I can take the couch.
You can have the bed.

1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:04.500
No. You…

1:14:05.625 --> 1:14:07.500
take your bed. I'll take the couch.

1:14:08.458 --> 1:14:09.833
[softly] Okay. Here.

1:14:18.875 --> 1:14:19.875
[Caleb grunts]

1:14:22.833 --> 1:14:24.125
Ooh, yeah.

1:14:25.666 --> 1:14:27.583
-[mellow music playing]
-[Caleb sighs]

1:14:29.666 --> 1:14:30.583
[exhales]

1:14:39.916 --> 1:14:41.083
[Caleb snoring loudly]

1:14:44.166 --> 1:14:45.250
[Caleb snorts]

1:14:49.833 --> 1:14:51.541
[Caleb sniffs, grunts]

1:14:52.500 --> 1:14:53.916
[Caleb groans, snorts]

1:14:55.208 --> 1:14:56.041
[snorts]

1:14:57.125 --> 1:14:58.041
[laughing]

1:15:00.291 --> 1:15:04.500
-Kidding!
-[both laugh]

1:15:04.583 --> 1:15:06.458
Oh, my goodness!

1:15:08.041 --> 1:15:10.458
I can't believe
you weren't going to say anything, though.

1:15:10.541 --> 1:15:11.708
Speechless!

1:15:11.791 --> 1:15:13.500
[both laughing]

1:15:14.541 --> 1:15:16.458
-[Erica] Goodnight!
-Night.

1:15:26.958 --> 1:15:29.333
[knocking at door]

1:15:31.041 --> 1:15:33.041
-Mm.
-[knocking at door continues]

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:36.833
Coming!

1:15:38.750 --> 1:15:39.916
Erica, I need to talk to you.

1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.708
Jason, um,
this isn't exactly the right time. I…

1:15:44.708 --> 1:15:46.125
What are you doin' here?

1:15:47.916 --> 1:15:50.208
Look… Jason…

1:15:50.291 --> 1:15:53.666
-[chuckles] I knew somethin' was goin' on.
-What? No. We were…

1:15:54.166 --> 1:15:57.250
-We were just watching Netflix and fell--
-Oh, Netflix and chill.

1:15:57.333 --> 1:15:59.166
Now I feel real good about the situation.

1:15:59.250 --> 1:16:00.958
He doesn't even know
what that means, Jason.

1:16:01.041 --> 1:16:03.875
I-- I know what it means.
I know what it means.

1:16:03.958 --> 1:16:07.208
But it was-- it was just Netflix,
all right? There was no chill.

1:16:07.875 --> 1:16:10.541
Jason, even if it was,
you're getting married today, remember?

1:16:17.583 --> 1:16:18.416
[sighs]

1:16:23.541 --> 1:16:27.125
Erica, goin' after him isn't gonna
help either one of you right now.

1:16:27.625 --> 1:16:28.541
Erica?

1:16:28.625 --> 1:16:29.541
Erica?

1:16:30.750 --> 1:16:31.583
[sighs]

1:16:32.208 --> 1:16:34.875
Erica, you should be
with someone who is sure

1:16:35.666 --> 1:16:37.500
that you're the only choice for him.

1:16:39.458 --> 1:16:42.083
That man is not Jason.

1:16:49.833 --> 1:16:50.666
Jason!

1:16:51.250 --> 1:16:52.083
[sighs]

1:16:55.916 --> 1:16:58.625
Hey! Okay, you stop this right now.

1:16:58.708 --> 1:17:01.375
This craziness stops right now.

1:17:01.458 --> 1:17:05.500
-We're not running through the sand.
-Oh, how… My brother? Really?

1:17:05.583 --> 1:17:07.666
Nothing happened.

1:17:07.750 --> 1:17:10.250
But are you-- are you really jealous, or

1:17:11.041 --> 1:17:12.708
are you having cold feet, Jason?

1:17:13.375 --> 1:17:14.333
I don't know.

1:17:16.041 --> 1:17:17.791
I screwed everything up with you.

1:17:17.875 --> 1:17:20.541
What's gonna stop me
from screwin' everything up with her, too?

1:17:22.291 --> 1:17:23.125
[sighs]

1:17:24.416 --> 1:17:26.541
We screwed things up for each other.

1:17:28.833 --> 1:17:30.041
Jason, the truth is,

1:17:31.833 --> 1:17:33.708
if you hadn't called off the wedding,

1:17:34.291 --> 1:17:35.458
I probably would have.

1:17:39.083 --> 1:17:39.916
Then…

1:17:41.458 --> 1:17:42.708
Then what is all of this?

1:17:44.958 --> 1:17:45.875
[sighs]

1:17:45.958 --> 1:17:46.791
Nostalgia.

1:17:47.875 --> 1:17:50.458
Coincidence. Guilt. Uh, I don't know.

1:17:50.541 --> 1:17:52.291
[sighs] Maybe all of the above.

1:17:52.375 --> 1:17:53.416
[breathing heavily]

1:17:54.666 --> 1:17:56.000
But if this was right…

1:17:58.041 --> 1:18:01.250
and you were the love of my life,
then it would not be this hard.

1:18:07.625 --> 1:18:08.500
[Jason exhales]

1:18:11.416 --> 1:18:12.291
I love her.

1:18:15.083 --> 1:18:17.083
I was on my over to tell you that.

1:18:17.166 --> 1:18:19.791
Then I saw Caleb,
and I just lost it. I just--

1:18:19.875 --> 1:18:22.208
Look at me. I'm gonna screw this up.
I'm gonna screw this up.

1:18:22.291 --> 1:18:25.375
-I know I'm gonna screw this up--
-No. Look. No. Listen. No, you're not!

1:18:27.083 --> 1:18:28.166
Beverly loves you.

1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:33.333
You love her.

1:18:36.666 --> 1:18:38.500
[exhales] Hmm.

1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:42.166
I feel like you're walkin' me across
another bridge.

1:18:43.083 --> 1:18:43.916
Well…

1:18:45.791 --> 1:18:47.541
we got across the last one, right?

1:18:50.041 --> 1:18:50.875
Yeah.

1:18:52.375 --> 1:18:53.750
-We did.
-Mm-hmm.

1:18:54.458 --> 1:18:56.333
Come on. Let's get you married.

1:18:59.583 --> 1:19:00.875
Yes, big sis.

1:19:00.958 --> 1:19:03.875
Ma chérie. C'est trop bien. [chuckles]

1:19:03.958 --> 1:19:05.500
You look so beautiful!

1:19:05.583 --> 1:19:07.666
You like the sun behind you?

1:19:07.750 --> 1:19:09.583
Comfortable with those shadows?

1:19:09.666 --> 1:19:12.833
No, I love the shade.
These are just some candid shots. So…

1:19:12.916 --> 1:19:16.000
The photographers gonna come any minute.
Don't… Any second…

1:19:16.083 --> 1:19:19.791
Maybe if she stands with
her better side forward.

1:19:19.875 --> 1:19:23.125
-[Janelle] Okay, careful now.
-[Beverly] Thank you, Ms. King.

1:19:23.208 --> 1:19:24.083
Thank you.

1:19:24.166 --> 1:19:27.208
-[Janelle] Wow. All right then.
-Is that Erica with Jason?

1:19:27.708 --> 1:19:31.000
Why on earth would my son
invite his ex to his wedding?

1:19:31.666 --> 1:19:32.541
His ex?

1:19:32.625 --> 1:19:35.541
Thank God he had the good sense
to call that off.

1:19:35.625 --> 1:19:38.875
But this staying friends
with your ex, ugh…

1:19:38.958 --> 1:19:39.791
When?

1:19:41.416 --> 1:19:42.791
When did he break up with her?

1:19:42.875 --> 1:19:46.125
-About a month before the wedding.
-Okay, "the wedding." Oh.

1:19:46.208 --> 1:19:47.333
[Naomi] Mm-hmm.

1:19:47.416 --> 1:19:50.625
-When were they engaged?
-Last year.

1:19:51.458 --> 1:19:54.375
[Janelle] Little hussy messed
with the wrong family.

1:19:55.041 --> 1:19:58.000
She's gonna curse the day she ever came
to the wedding.

1:19:58.083 --> 1:19:59.875
You better call the ambulance.

1:19:59.958 --> 1:20:03.125
-[shouting] Call the Mauritian police!
-[dramatic music playing]

1:20:08.458 --> 1:20:09.333
[sighs]

1:20:10.333 --> 1:20:11.583
Erica!

1:20:12.708 --> 1:20:13.541
Janelle?

1:20:13.625 --> 1:20:17.166
-You lying, scheming, two-faced--
-It's not what you think!

1:20:17.250 --> 1:20:19.208
[Janelle] I know where you live.

1:20:19.708 --> 1:20:20.625
[Janelle yells]

1:20:21.375 --> 1:20:22.250
Where is she?

1:20:33.083 --> 1:20:35.333
Erica! Erica, I need your help.

1:20:35.416 --> 1:20:38.500
Beverly's sister called all out of breath.
Beverly has canceled the wedding.

1:20:38.583 --> 1:20:39.541
Oh no!

1:20:39.625 --> 1:20:42.750
Yes, and she's run away.
Nobody can find her. It's terrible.

1:20:42.833 --> 1:20:45.541
Not for us. They still have to pay
for the wedding, but I feel bad.

1:20:45.625 --> 1:20:48.208
She was breathing out a lot of emotion.

1:20:48.291 --> 1:20:50.666
If you can help,
I would be eternally grateful.

1:20:50.750 --> 1:20:53.083
Of course. Okay.
I'll-- I'll-- I'm on it. I'm on it.

1:20:53.166 --> 1:20:56.458
The cabanas are the other way.
Have you forgotten your ground tutorial?

1:20:56.541 --> 1:20:57.583
Oh, c'est impossible.

1:20:57.666 --> 1:21:00.125
-[yelling]
-[dramatic percussive music playing]

1:21:00.750 --> 1:21:02.416
Yeah, you better run, Erica!

1:21:02.500 --> 1:21:03.333
[panting]

1:21:05.333 --> 1:21:07.083
-[Janelle panting]
-[Erica grunts]

1:21:08.250 --> 1:21:09.166
[Erica grunts]

1:21:10.625 --> 1:21:12.958
-Oh, this is not a good time.
-Drive!

1:21:15.291 --> 1:21:16.500
[Beverly] Get out!

1:21:17.791 --> 1:21:18.666
See what I mean?

1:21:18.750 --> 1:21:22.666
You get out of this van right now!
I know that you and Jason were engaged.

1:21:22.750 --> 1:21:25.375
I know you've been lying to me
this whole time.

1:21:25.458 --> 1:21:26.958
Make her get out of this van!

1:21:29.375 --> 1:21:32.625
-Wait. Let me fix this.
-How could you possibly fix this?

1:21:32.708 --> 1:21:35.625
-Look, you deserve the truth. You do.
-The truth.

1:21:35.708 --> 1:21:39.000
But-- But let me-- let me share this truth
a little bit further down the road.

1:21:39.083 --> 1:21:41.125
-What?
-Further down. Just keep driving.

1:21:41.208 --> 1:21:42.291
[engine revving]

1:21:42.375 --> 1:21:45.000
-[Beverly] Take me to the airport.
-There's been a misunderstanding.

1:21:45.083 --> 1:21:48.666
A mis-- I saw the two of you
on the beach-- Know what? Never mind.

1:21:48.750 --> 1:21:50.958
I will give you $200
if you throw her out of this van.

1:21:51.041 --> 1:21:53.458
-[Barrington chuckles]
-Okay? Five, if it is still moving.

1:21:54.583 --> 1:21:55.875
Don't even think about it.

1:21:55.958 --> 1:21:58.708
If you don't throw her out of this van
right now, I'mma start swingin'.

1:21:58.791 --> 1:22:02.291
[Barrington] All right. All right.
Okay, this is not part of my job.

1:22:02.375 --> 1:22:05.250
Barrington.
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

1:22:06.166 --> 1:22:08.500
-[Barrington] I just… [clears throat]
-No. No, no, no, no.

1:22:08.583 --> 1:22:10.083
Okay, I bruise easily.

1:22:10.166 --> 1:22:12.166
-Okay.
-[Beverly] No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

1:22:12.250 --> 1:22:14.333
-[Erica] Barrington!

but we were-- we were both afraid that…

Jason and I are the idiots.

-No, we don't.

behind my back, then?

of him showing up here to get married?

Beverly, I never got closure.

1:23:33.125 --> 1:23:35.583
[sighs] I was happy, and I was hustling,

1:23:37.541 --> 1:23:39.375
and all of a sudden, Jason was gone.

1:23:41.416 --> 1:23:42.583
And I was sad,

1:23:43.333 --> 1:23:44.750

1:23:46.291 --> 1:23:47.875

since I was a little girl was music.

1:23:54.208 --> 1:23:56.250
I still thought my dream was coming true.

1:23:57.583 --> 1:23:58.416
Mm-hmm.

1:23:58.958 --> 1:24:02.750
But that dream
was never getting married to Jason,

1:24:02.833 --> 1:24:05.250
and that should have been my dream.

1:24:05.333 --> 1:24:06.541

1:24:08.041 --> 1:24:09.250

1:24:10.750 --> 1:24:12.958
Then why are you giving up so easily?

1:24:16.083 --> 1:24:20.875
Just the idea
that Jason wasn't sure about me,

1:24:21.666 --> 1:24:23.125
even just for a moment,

1:24:24.583 --> 1:24:25.541
it hurts.

1:24:29.958 --> 1:24:32.083
I know, and I'm sorry.

1:24:37.250 --> 1:24:38.708
But Jason is so sure.

1:24:39.458 --> 1:24:42.458

just-- just please, just go hear him out.

1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:26.541
when people say, "I love you,"

1:26:27.458 --> 1:26:32.250
I think they focus on the "love" part,
and they don't recognize the "you" part.

1:26:34.375 --> 1:26:35.750
When I say "you,"

1:26:36.500 --> 1:26:38.333
