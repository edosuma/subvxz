03:00.939 --> 03:05.820
I will always try my best
to be honest and fair,

03:05.902 --> 03:08.621
to be helpful and friendly,

03:08.697 --> 03:14.329
to be a good citizen,
a good neighbor, a good friend,

03:15.037 --> 03:18.041
and a sister to every Wilderness Girl.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.375
Girls, about face!

03:26.005 --> 03:29.350
The first order of business
is the Beverly Hills troop.

03:29.884 --> 03:32.637
Well, you know,
they've never earned any patches.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.814
They've never even sold a single cookie.

03:34.889 --> 03:37.984
We all know they've had more leaders
than a banana republic.

03:38.059 --> 03:42.064
Their membership is down to only eight.

03:42.146 --> 03:43.489
So it's agreed then.

03:43.564 --> 03:46.192
We stop mollycoddling
those little princesses,

03:46.275 --> 03:48.949
and we flush that troop
down the old proverbial dumper.

03:49.028 --> 03:53.374
Now, Velda,
as long as they are girls who want to belong,

03:53.449 --> 03:56.999
it's our job to see
that they're not denied the privilege.

03:57.078 --> 03:59.547
Let's give them one last chance.

03:59.914 --> 04:04.169
Now, about a new leader,
I understand we have an applicant.

04:04.251 --> 04:05.798
Herman. File, file.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.380
Yes, sir... Ma'am.

04:12.802 --> 04:15.681
Name, Phyllis Nefler.

04:15.763 --> 04:17.435
Age...

04:17.515 --> 04:20.610
Says here "not applicable."

04:20.685 --> 04:22.311
Marital status,

04:23.728 --> 04:24.900
"shaky?

04:25.980 --> 04:28.904
<i>Interests, "community affairs."</i>

04:28.983 --> 04:34.205
Dr. Jerry Honigman is definitely
boffing the blond and the English tutor.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.032
Is that the one with the tummy tuck?

04:36.116 --> 04:37.868
And the daughter.

04:37.951 --> 04:39.123
No.

04:39.994 --> 04:43.498
This one and this one.

04:43.581 --> 04:46.585
Out. I'll take the rest.

04:46.668 --> 04:52.971
Prides herself on being honest,
resourceful, and thrifty.

04:54.801 --> 04:56.929
- How much?
-$5,600.

04:58.972 --> 05:00.974
You know, it's missing a bead.

05:01.057 --> 05:02.809
It is?

05:08.982 --> 05:11.576
I can let you have it for $5,000.

05:12.610 --> 05:14.487
- I'll take it.
- Great.

05:15.238 --> 05:16.740
She loves animals.

05:18.450 --> 05:20.418
I'm gonna kiss you.

05:20.493 --> 05:23.996
I'm gonna kiss you, froggy,
and turn you into a handsome prince.

05:24.830 --> 05:29.427
This woman sounds like
she's got Wilderness Girl written all over her.

05:29.501 --> 05:30.878
Approved.

06:10.417 --> 06:11.919
Hi ho!

06:12.002 --> 06:13.254
Ohio!

06:14.171 --> 06:16.674
Hey, your hat is fabulous Mrs. Nefler.

06:16.757 --> 06:20.261
- Thank you. So is yours.
- Hey, thanks.

06:21.887 --> 06:25.186
Rosa! Rosa!

06:26.349 --> 06:28.898
Keep talking, honey, so I can move
toward the sound of your voice.

06:28.976 --> 06:31.525
Here I am. Yeah, come... Keep... I'm here.

06:31.604 --> 06:33.652
Come. Come. I got it. I got it.

06:33.731 --> 06:36.325
I started my new meaningful life today,

06:36.400 --> 06:39.074
and I bought a whole new
meaningful wardrobe to go with it.

06:39.153 --> 06:42.077
I can hardly wait to see the look
on Freddy's face when he gets the bill.

06:42.156 --> 06:43.578
And you know the beauty of it?

06:43.658 --> 06:47.208
He won't even the get the bill
until after we're divorced.

06:48.371 --> 06:49.748
Have your fun now, Phyllis,

06:50.498 --> 06:54.378
'cause after the divorce is final,
you're going to be shopping at Pick 'n Save.

06:56.087 --> 06:57.680
What are you doing here?

06:57.755 --> 06:59.928
Before we were separated,
you were never around.

07:00.383 --> 07:02.306
You're supposed to be in the guesthouse.

07:02.760 --> 07:05.013
Everything north of the lawn jockey is mine.

07:05.096 --> 07:06.348
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:06.430 --> 07:09.058
Come on. I can come here anytime I want to.

07:09.141 --> 07:10.859
Yeah. It's still my house, you know.

07:10.935 --> 07:12.903
And right now, I am gonna go upstairs,

07:12.979 --> 07:16.654
I'm gonna get my barbell,
and I'm gonna get the rest of my clothes.

07:16.732 --> 07:21.112
Touch anything in this house,
and I'll call my lawyer.

07:21.195 --> 07:23.368
I can touch anything I want.

07:24.782 --> 07:26.749
I paid for it all.

07:26.825 --> 07:30.045
Now isn't that a mature approach
to a relationship?

07:30.120 --> 07:33.124
Freddy, did it ever occur to you
that marriage is a partnership?

07:33.206 --> 07:34.298
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

07:34.374 --> 07:36.547
I earn the money,
and my partner, she spends it.

07:36.626 --> 07:38.970
Typical, that is so typical.

07:39.045 --> 07:41.343
And don't you mock me
while I'm talking to you!

07:41.423 --> 07:44.347
You never acknowledge
my contribution to this marriage.

07:44.426 --> 07:45.928
- Your contribution?
- Yes!

07:46.011 --> 07:50.642
Phyllis, if you contributed any more
to this marriage, we would be on welfare!

07:51.308 --> 07:54.733
Hello, Hannah.
You remember your father, the Big Bad Wolf?

07:54.811 --> 07:56.654
- Hi, Peaches.
- Hi, Daddy.

07:56.730 --> 07:58.482
What are you picking up this time?

07:58.565 --> 08:00.567
- My dumbbells.
- Be my guest.

08:00.650 --> 08:02.948
The fewer dumbbells in my life, the better.

08:03.028 --> 08:06.783
I've got a great idea.
Why don't you two just kiss and make up?

08:06.865 --> 08:09.744
Then I won't end up in therapy twice a week
like Tessa.

08:10.327 --> 08:11.829
Honey, you're gonna be less neurotic

08:11.912 --> 08:15.507
if your parents are happily divorced
rather than unhappily married.

08:15.582 --> 08:18.711
- Thank you, Phil Donahue.
- I saw it on Oprah.

08:18.793 --> 08:22.047
Cool it. You're acting so immature.

08:23.715 --> 08:27.344
Mom, a lady called
about an orientation meeting.

08:27.426 --> 08:28.928
It's Thursday.

08:30.220 --> 08:32.438
You are gonna go through with this,
aren't you?

08:32.514 --> 08:33.811
Of course, I am.

08:33.890 --> 08:35.688
Go through with what?

08:36.684 --> 08:39.985
Just a little mother-daughter bonding thing.

08:41.357 --> 08:43.485
Mom's going to be our new troop leader.

08:46.695 --> 08:47.787
What's so funny?

08:47.863 --> 08:49.706
Well, I mean, it's hysterical.

08:49.782 --> 08:52.911
You don't have any skills.
You hate the outdoors.

08:52.993 --> 08:56.247
Besides, you never finished anything
you ever started.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.799
- What about the PTA?
- You quit!

08:58.874 --> 09:02.674
Well, that was just because
it conflicted with Save the Whales.

09:02.753 --> 09:03.970
Then what happened?

09:04.046 --> 09:07.971
Well, I thought
Hands Across America was more important.

09:08.050 --> 09:10.519
Well, I rest my case!

09:10.594 --> 09:14.144
You'll be lucky if you last a couple of weeks.

09:14.223 --> 09:16.817
I'm going to be a great Troop Leader.

09:16.892 --> 09:18.314
And I'll be spending more time with Hannah.

09:18.394 --> 09:20.943
What? And neglect Rodeo Drive?

09:22.106 --> 09:24.859
Don't criticize my mothering, Mr. Workaholic.

09:25.234 --> 09:27.577
You're hardly father of the year.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.662
Rosa, will you stop crying?

09:33.741 --> 09:36.119
Who's getting the divorce here, you or me?

09:36.577 --> 09:39.126
I don't want you two to split up.

09:41.249 --> 09:45.254
See, there, I told you
not to mention divorce in front of Rosa.

09:45.336 --> 09:47.259
She's helping me pack!

09:50.091 --> 09:51.764
What's happened to us, Fred?

09:55.054 --> 09:57.102
What's this really about?

10:00.643 --> 10:02.270
Is there another woman?

10:04.313 --> 10:07.783
Well, yeah, there is.

10:08.568 --> 10:11.242
A girl I met a long, long time ago.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.625
Bright, caring, loving, funny.

10:17.410 --> 10:18.627
It was you.

10:20.079 --> 10:24.880
You had such potential, such energy.
You were so creative.

10:24.959 --> 10:27.758
I couldn't wait to see what you'd do with it.

10:27.837 --> 10:30.635
See, now, I know what you did with it.

10:30.714 --> 10:31.806
You went shopping!

10:33.967 --> 10:38.643
Hey, I went shopping, buster,
to furnish your perfect house,

10:39.139 --> 10:44.396
to build your perfect image,
to be your perfect, Beverly Hills wife!

10:44.478 --> 10:47.948
And you think I've changed?
How about you, Fred?

10:48.023 --> 10:51.197
I coupon-clipped your way
through law school,

10:51.276 --> 10:53.654
so you could make a difference in the world,

10:53.737 --> 10:56.616
not so you could be Nefler the Muffler Man!

10:56.698 --> 10:59.167
Hey, those commercials were your idea.

10:59.242 --> 11:03.543
And I didn't hear you complaining when
you were spending the Muffler Man's money.

11:03.622 --> 11:09.470
I mean, I know it's not a really important job,
you know, like being a Wilderness Girl.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.595
I don't expect you to understand
how much this means to me, or to Hannah,

11:14.674 --> 11:17.769
or her little friends, who happen to need me.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.602
Even if you don't.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.230
You never give me an ounce of credit
for anything I do.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.607
That's because you never do anything!

11:27.354 --> 11:31.199
Well, then, I guess
I'm going to do something right now.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.068
I'll help you pack.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.172
Marlene, I'm on my way to the hospital now.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.505
I'm stopping to drop Tiffany off
at her troop meeting.

11:53.587 --> 11:58.809
I have a nose job at 3:00,
a lift at 5:00, and a boob job at 7:00,

11:58.884 --> 12:00.636
so you won't be able to reach me.

12:00.719 --> 12:03.313
Daddy, do I have to go to this thing?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.312
- Tiff, you'll love it.
<i>- I'll</i> hate it.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.234
What'd you... Hold on a second, sweetie.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.403
- I said I'd give you 10 bucks.
-It's not worth it.

12:09.478 --> 12:10.570
-$20.
- No way.

12:10.646 --> 12:11.647
-$30.
-$50.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.028
$40, and that's my final offer.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.449
I'll suffer through it.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.286
What do you think?

12:23.534 --> 12:25.502
It looks great.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.797
Is the caviar too much?

12:33.334 --> 12:34.335
Here comes Chica.

12:34.419 --> 12:38.140
Chica Barnfell, our first arrival!

12:38.423 --> 12:40.846
Chica! Hi!

12:40.925 --> 12:42.768
Do you remember me? Phyllis Nefler.

12:42.844 --> 12:47.270
We met at your parents' home
in Palms Springs when Fergie was in town?

12:47.348 --> 12:49.350
What a lovely child.

12:54.606 --> 12:57.860
Dad, why are we stopping here?
The park is a block up.

12:57.942 --> 13:01.788
I'm late for an appointment, honey.
That's the actor's life, busy, busy.

13:02.197 --> 13:03.949
You're going to unemployment, right?

13:04.449 --> 13:07.498
Right. Anyway, you have a good time, okay?

13:09.704 --> 13:12.799
Dad, I'm supposed to bring $10 for dues.

13:13.875 --> 13:16.754
Emily, I forgot my wallet.
Tell 'em you'll bring it next time.

13:17.629 --> 13:19.176
Okay.

13:19.255 --> 13:20.552
I'll get something soon.

13:20.632 --> 13:24.307
My agent says this nostalgia boom
is going to make me a big star again.

13:25.011 --> 13:27.139
You'll always be a star to me, Daddy.

13:29.015 --> 13:31.984
- I love you.
- I love you. Bye.

13:47.366 --> 13:49.164
Good morning. You must be Lily.

13:49.743 --> 13:52.587
Good morning, Dictator. Mrs. Dictator.

13:52.663 --> 13:55.416
- Good morning.
- Lovely to see you.

13:56.375 --> 13:59.174
Bruce, I looked at the dailies.

13:59.253 --> 14:02.097
I want to reshoot the ending.
Set it up for today.

14:02.172 --> 14:05.016
Today? 5,000 extras?

14:05.092 --> 14:07.515
Redford? Fifteen helicopters?

14:08.011 --> 14:11.140
- Dad, you can't do it.
- Why not, Tessa?

14:11.223 --> 14:15.569
You're $10 million over budget.
Redford's on another project,

14:15.644 --> 14:18.363
and you blew up
all the helicopters yesterday.

14:18.438 --> 14:19.564
I did?

14:19.648 --> 14:24.700
Daddy, my therapist would say
you're definitely blocking reality.

14:29.533 --> 14:31.206
What was it again, $30?

14:31.285 --> 14:33.036
-$40.
-$40.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.968
May I see your license
and registration, please?

14:45.047 --> 14:46.219
What's the problem, Officer?

14:46.299 --> 14:48.472
You know
how fast you were going back there?

14:48.551 --> 14:53.227
Excuse me, Officer,
don't you know who this man is?

14:53.306 --> 14:55.058
- Jasmine, honey.
- Jasmine, cool it.

14:55.141 --> 14:56.814
You're too modest, Daddy.

14:56.892 --> 15:01.773
Look, this here's the man
who put the space in Spinks' teeth,

15:01.856 --> 15:04.575
the man who
knocked the hair off Hagler's head.

15:04.650 --> 15:06.698
He's the best. He's the greatest.

15:06.777 --> 15:10.498
He's my dad,
James "The Jackhammer" Shaker.

15:10.573 --> 15:16.080
Now, Daddy, shake the man's hand,
and let's be on our way.

15:17.788 --> 15:20.587
How do you do, sir? Glad to meet you.

15:20.666 --> 15:22.668
Could I get your autograph?

15:22.752 --> 15:24.220
Not on that thing, you won't.

15:34.763 --> 15:37.391
He pulled off her Halston gown,

15:37.474 --> 15:43.527
sighed lusciously at the sight of
her Fernando Sénchez underthings, and...

15:45.231 --> 15:46.699
And what?

15:46.775 --> 15:50.996
And felt his manhood rising to a frenzy.

15:55.075 --> 15:59.376
Felt his manhood
rising to a pulsating frenzy.

15:59.454 --> 16:01.297
Yeah, that's good. I love it.

16:01.373 --> 16:04.047
Now, darling,
what am I gonna tell your producer

16:04.125 --> 16:06.924
about you skipping rehearsals today?

16:07.003 --> 16:08.505
- Tell him I'm sick.
- Claire.

16:08.588 --> 16:13.560
Come on, Mom. I'm not just a kid on TV.
I'm one in real life.

16:13.635 --> 16:16.388
I want to do something normal
for a change, okay?

16:16.471 --> 16:19.270
Normal with Phyllis running the show?

16:19.349 --> 16:21.443
That's highly bloody unlikely.

16:22.685 --> 16:26.735
Welcome. I'm Phyllis Nefler,
mother of the lovely Hannah.

16:26.815 --> 16:28.112
Mother!

16:28.191 --> 16:31.070
And, <i>as</i> you know, your new leader.

16:31.152 --> 16:34.076
Now I know
that we're gonna have a fabulous time

16:34.155 --> 16:39.251
because I can see that you're all special,
unique, fabulous little people

16:39.326 --> 16:40.418
just raring to go.

16:40.494 --> 16:44.874
She'll be just like all the others.
She'll get bored with us, and she'll quit.

16:44.957 --> 16:49.258
I'm new at this, but
aren't you supposed to be wearing uniforms?

16:49.336 --> 16:51.759
Sick, uniforms are sick.

16:51.839 --> 16:54.683
They blur an individual's sense of self.

16:54.758 --> 16:58.854
Besides, no one ever stayed around
long enough to take us to the store.

16:58.929 --> 17:04.060
Well, I may be a beginner at some things,
but I've got a black belt in shopping.

17:08.021 --> 17:09.397
Do they only come in khaki?

17:09.481 --> 17:12.075
Yes. Now what sizes do you need?

17:12.151 --> 17:14.994
- Well, I need a French 36.
-If you want that French stuff,

17:15.069 --> 17:16.742
you're gonna have to go
to Frederick's of Hollywood.

17:18.198 --> 17:20.165
Are you sure you're Wilderness Girls?

17:20.534 --> 17:23.208
I'm not selling this shit
for no masquerade parties.

17:30.377 --> 17:31.674
How's it look?

17:31.753 --> 17:32.970
I like it.

17:33.046 --> 17:35.798
-It's great.
-It's okay.

17:35.882 --> 17:39.557
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

17:40.428 --> 17:43.102
-It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

17:43.181 --> 17:46.230
Except for the color's wrong,
the collar's wrong,

17:46.309 --> 17:48.858
the material's a nightmare from hell.

17:48.936 --> 17:52.406
It's cut badly, it itches, and it's not me.

17:53.399 --> 17:55.822
But all of that can be fixed.

17:55.902 --> 17:55.948
Henri? Henri.

17:55.943 --> 17:58.537
Henri? Henri.

17:59.906 --> 18:03.001
My god, darling, what is that?

18:03.075 --> 18:07.171
I know. It's my Wilderness Girl uniform.
What can you do with it?

18:07.246 --> 18:09.089
You mean, besides burn it?

18:15.087 --> 18:17.510
My name is Velda Plendor.

18:17.590 --> 18:22.721
I'm a mother. I'm a widow.
I'm an ex-Army nurse.

18:23.221 --> 18:26.521
First and foremost, I am a Wilderness Girl,

18:27.600 --> 18:33.858
and I have the privilege
of turning you civilians into troop leaders.

18:35.983 --> 18:40.488
Now it's not easy.
It's not going to be a picnic.

18:40.570 --> 18:42.288
Not all of you are going to make it.

18:43.114 --> 18:46.209
So if any of you
little Betty Crockers out there

18:46.284 --> 18:49.379
think that you're just going to be teaching
some little toddlers

18:49.454 --> 18:50.876
how to bake cuppie cakes,

18:50.956 --> 18:52.833
then you can leave now.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.969
Perfect. Good. Good. Let 'em go.

19:01.341 --> 19:06.814
Because when we're looking for new leaders,
we're looking for a real no-nonsense woman.

19:09.933 --> 19:10.934
Hi.

19:12.102 --> 19:13.319
Bye.

19:13.395 --> 19:16.148
A woman who can cope with anything.

19:16.773 --> 19:20.653
A woman who doesn't make a ruckus...

19:21.653 --> 19:24.247
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

19:24.990 --> 19:28.415
But still can get the job done.

19:28.493 --> 19:29.870
I'm so sorry.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.173
Our goal is simple,

19:38.502 --> 19:40.596
to take young, vulnerable girls

19:40.671 --> 19:44.346
and turn them into strong,
self-sufficient, young women.

19:45.092 --> 19:47.015
And to attain that goal,

19:47.761 --> 19:51.937
the girls must earn achievement patches,
sell cookies,

19:52.016 --> 19:57.147
and attend the annual Jamboree,
which is a grueling test.

19:57.229 --> 20:00.699
Are you drying your nails,
or do you have a question?

20:02.192 --> 20:04.286
- No, they're fine.
- Yes?

20:04.862 --> 20:06.739
You know, about the cookies,

20:06.822 --> 20:10.622
I know it's customary in order
to raise funds to sell cookies door-to-door,

20:10.701 --> 20:11.827
and that's adorable.

20:11.910 --> 20:15.130
But wouldn't it save time
and a little shoe leather,

20:15.205 --> 20:19.210
if we just had a star-studded telethon?

20:20.586 --> 20:22.964
- Who are you?
- Johnny could host or Merv.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.264
It'd be fabulous.

20:24.340 --> 20:25.557
Who are you?

20:26.050 --> 20:28.974
Phyllis Nefler, Troop Beverly Hills.

20:29.970 --> 20:32.519
Shit. I should have known.

20:33.265 --> 20:37.190
<i>Do you know the Muffler Man
the Muffler Man, the Muffler Man?</i>

20:37.895 --> 20:41.239
<i>Do you know the Muffler Man?
Nefler is his name</i>

20:41.314 --> 20:44.989
<i>Hi, Fred Nefler here for Neflefs Mufflers.</i>

20:45.068 --> 20:47.446
<i>Boy, I'm telling you,
We're a hard working crew,</i>

20:47.570 --> 20:50.164
<i>and look at the sick little baby
we got in here today.</i>

20:50.239 --> 20:52.742
<i>Now if your Pinto, Porsche,
or whatever is sick,</i>

20:52.825 --> 20:56.204
<i>we don't discriminate here.
We'll fix anything. We'll fix it right.</i>

20:56.287 --> 20:58.836
<i>- I'm telling you...
- He's</i> a <i>shit,</i>

20:58.915 --> 21:00.792
but he's a cute shit.

21:38.788 --> 21:42.212
Hannah, wake up. Wake up, honey.

21:42.290 --> 21:44.213
There's a woman going into the guesthouse.

21:44.793 --> 21:46.795
Dark hair, long legs, big boobs?

21:47.546 --> 21:51.176
Stringy hair, skinny legs, silicone boobs,
but yes.

21:51.258 --> 21:54.558
Don't worry, Mom.
It's just Lisa, Dad's realtor.

21:54.636 --> 21:56.309
She's trying to find him a condo.

21:56.388 --> 22:00.063
At midnight? It must be a real hot listing.

22:01.101 --> 22:03.945
Mom, can we spy on dad in the morning?

22:04.020 --> 22:07.741
Spy? Excuse me, spy?

22:09.484 --> 22:14.240
Your father's nocturnal activities
are of absolutely no interest to me.

22:34.259 --> 22:35.306
Shit.

22:40.389 --> 22:41.481
Night, Phyllis.

22:41.974 --> 22:44.272
"Night, Phyllis."

22:44.852 --> 22:47.025
- She's okay.
- That's good. Bye.

22:47.104 --> 22:48.196
Bye.

22:56.197 --> 22:58.495
- Here.
- Good.

22:59.742 --> 23:01.460
Watch the arms.

23:06.999 --> 23:08.046
- Mom?
- Yeah.

23:08.125 --> 23:12.426
I think we'll be back before winter.
It's only an overnight campout.

23:12.505 --> 23:16.135
In the wilderness of life,
we can never be too prepared.

23:19.887 --> 23:22.640
Well, girls, are you ready to rough it?

23:51.417 --> 23:53.215
What are we supposed to do now?

23:53.294 --> 23:55.888
Well, we were supposed
to set up the tents and stuff.

23:55.964 --> 23:58.513
Yeah, but the Abbey Rents person
already did that.

23:58.591 --> 24:01.470
This is so boring. Someone should go
ask her what we're supposed to do.

24:01.553 --> 24:03.430
Well, let's all go.

24:07.475 --> 24:08.852
Having fun?

24:09.978 --> 24:11.946
Mrs. Nefler.

24:12.021 --> 24:14.865
We're above the fire line,
and you shouldn't be smoking.

24:14.941 --> 24:16.193
It's bad for you.

24:16.276 --> 24:20.747
And it disguises nervous conditions
which you should deal with in other ways.

24:20.822 --> 24:23.792
Smokey the Bear says
only you can prevent forest fires.

24:23.867 --> 24:27.337
Smokey the Bear isn't going through
a terribly messy divorce.

24:29.122 --> 24:33.502
And voila', fondue alfresco.

24:37.130 --> 24:40.805
And next, we're going to make espresso.

24:41.301 --> 24:42.677
No!

24:42.759 --> 24:44.261
Fabulous.

24:44.344 --> 24:46.893
All right, all right, go in the tent.
Go in the tent.

24:46.972 --> 24:48.815
I'll save the dessert.

24:50.058 --> 24:51.810
This is special.

24:53.896 --> 24:56.365
I'm coming, girls! I've got the fondue!

25:12.581 --> 25:14.424
All right, all right.

25:25.010 --> 25:26.512
Gosh.

25:31.308 --> 25:33.402
- Look at your jacket.
- No.

25:34.770 --> 25:36.397
Can we just quit now?

25:37.606 --> 25:39.859
<i>Not until we sing Kumbaya.</i>

25:42.903 --> 25:45.655
<i>Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

25:46.364 --> 25:48.958
<i>Kumbaya</i>

25:50.201 --> 25:52.875
<i>Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

25:53.913 --> 25:55.756
<i>Kumbaya</i>

25:56.916 --> 26:00.136
<i>Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

26:00.211 --> 26:03.385
<i>Kumbaya</i>

26:03.464 --> 26:05.933
<i>Oh, Lord, kumbaya</i>

26:06.050 --> 26:08.428
<i>May I speak with Velda Plendor, please?</i>

26:10.429 --> 26:11.976
Well, will you take a message, please?

26:12.056 --> 26:14.650
Will you tell her
that Troop Leader Nefler called?

26:14.725 --> 26:18.696
And her recommendation
for a campsite was totally unsuitable.

26:19.438 --> 26:23.318
There were no outlets,
and there was dirt and bugs,

26:23.401 --> 26:25.495
and it rains there.

26:25.569 --> 26:28.789
So anyway, we found a place
that's much more us.

26:28.864 --> 26:31.162
And if any of the other parents call,

26:31.242 --> 26:34.587
you'll tell them
that we're at the Beverly Hills Hotel?

26:34.662 --> 26:36.209
Thank you.

26:38.666 --> 26:40.839
How about some room service?

26:40.918 --> 26:42.761
That sounds good.

26:43.379 --> 26:47.724
Yes, hello, I'd like to place an order, please.
Nefler, bungalow four.

26:50.051 --> 26:56.184
Then it sounded like it was in the foyer.

26:57.267 --> 27:04.025
"Who's got my golden arm?"

27:04.607 --> 27:08.908
Then it sounded
like it was in the maid's room.

27:10.572 --> 27:16.250
"Who's got my golden arm?"

27:20.790 --> 27:22.417
My gosh.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.385
Come on, Mrs. Nefler. It's your turn.

27:28.465 --> 27:31.139
- A scary story?
- Yeah, come on.

27:33.803 --> 27:35.805
- Okay.
- All right.

27:42.479 --> 27:46.483
It was a cold and rainy day in March.

27:47.858 --> 27:50.737
I went to Christophe's
where I usually get my hair done,

27:50.819 --> 27:55.495
but Christophe
had mysteriously disappeared.

27:56.658 --> 27:59.252
And in his place

27:59.328 --> 28:03.629
<i>was a stranger named Rename.</i>

28:06.251 --> 28:08.174
I'll never forget him.

28:09.338 --> 28:13.969
His eyes were steely gray, very cold.

28:14.051 --> 28:17.601
And his hands were like ice.

28:20.307 --> 28:23.982
He said, "I'll streak your hair,

28:25.938 --> 28:28.032
"and I'll give you a body wave."

28:30.025 --> 28:31.777
He worked very fast,

28:31.860 --> 28:36.832
and then as he turned my chair around
to face the mirror,

28:37.783 --> 28:38.784
I saw it.

28:40.202 --> 28:41.795
He permed me!

29:32.253 --> 29:36.349
<i>Hey, look, it's my giant underpants!</i>

29:37.425 --> 29:41.726
<i>You know, you can do a lot of cool stuff
with a pair of giant underpants. Just watch!</i>

29:45.266 --> 29:48.314
Hey, Hannah, look at me. I'm your mother.

29:49.311 --> 29:51.234
Follow me, girls.

29:51.313 --> 29:54.988
This is fabulous, just fabulous.

30:00.655 --> 30:03.704
<i>Chalk on the sidewalk
Writing on the wall</i>

30:03.783 --> 30:06.332
<i>Everybody knows it
I love Paul</i>

30:06.411 --> 30:08.379
Annette, wait up, huh?

30:09.706 --> 30:12.630
This is that bimbo's idea of a campsite?

30:12.709 --> 30:15.212
I'll raise you two marshmallows.

30:16.630 --> 30:22.137
I'll see your two marshmallows
and raise you a wiener.

30:23.470 --> 30:24.517
You're bluffing.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.562
Wilderness Girls don't bluff.

30:29.476 --> 30:31.274
<i>Look! I'm a nun!</i>

30:33.939 --> 30:36.112
- Hi. Good morning.
- Hello.

30:37.234 --> 30:38.486
No.

30:38.860 --> 30:40.988
You are out of here.

30:46.952 --> 30:47.999
Where is your leader?

30:49.662 --> 30:52.290
You can torture me if you want,
but I'll never talk.

30:52.998 --> 30:56.172
She's in the bedroom. Is she expecting you?

30:57.461 --> 31:00.886
Girls, did the room service arrive yet?

31:02.841 --> 31:05.435
Mon capitaine, what a pleasant surprise.

31:05.511 --> 31:07.479
Won't you join us
for a little cappuccino and croissant?

31:07.554 --> 31:10.228
Nefler, what the hell is happening here?

31:10.307 --> 31:13.527
This is supposed to be a camp out,
not a pajama party.

31:13.602 --> 31:14.945
This what you call roughing it?

31:15.396 --> 31:17.945
One bathroom for nine people? Yes.

31:19.191 --> 31:22.070
Maybe you never heard of
a little troop called the Red Feathers?

31:22.152 --> 31:25.406
They were out there
at that same site camping last week.

31:25.489 --> 31:28.208
They chopped down trees,
and wove their own cloth,

31:28.284 --> 31:30.412
and lived off of berries and squirrel meat.

31:30.494 --> 31:33.873
And never once
did they have to go to the bathroom.

31:34.581 --> 31:36.879
It must have been the squirrel meat.

31:40.546 --> 31:42.093
- Nefler...
- Cappuccino?

31:42.172 --> 31:45.722
You have disrupted my meetings
with your stupid, idiotic questions.

31:45.801 --> 31:50.852
You have taken the sacred uniform
and turned into a little cocktail frock.

31:50.930 --> 31:53.604
And you tore these children
from a wholesome camping environment,

31:53.683 --> 31:56.357
and you brought 'em here
to this little den of inequity.

31:56.436 --> 31:57.562
Just what are you trying to do, huh?

31:58.813 --> 32:01.532
Okay, so I'm not perfect.

32:01.607 --> 32:04.656
Granted, I'm new at this,

32:04.736 --> 32:08.115
and between us girls,
I haven't worked all the kinks out.

32:08.197 --> 32:12.919
So any tips for the new girl
would be greatly appreciated.

32:12.994 --> 32:14.996
- Well, here's a tip.
- Okay.

32:15.079 --> 32:16.080
Give it up.

32:16.664 --> 32:19.258
You can prance these princesses
through Beverly Hills all you want,

32:19.334 --> 32:23.009
but you will never really be
a real Wilderness Girl.

32:23.087 --> 32:25.010
This troop
should have been disbanded long ago.

32:25.089 --> 32:28.639
I know it, they know it, and you know it.

32:28.718 --> 32:30.846
<i>Adiés,</i> Nefler. Have a nice day.

32:30.928 --> 32:32.145
Herman!

32:40.605 --> 32:43.199
Guess it's back to the shrink on Tuesdays.

32:43.274 --> 32:45.276
So much for being normal.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.613
I knew it wouldn't last.

32:47.695 --> 32:49.868
Well, I don't know about you girls,

32:49.947 --> 32:53.496
but next Tuesday,
I'm going to be at the troop meeting.

33:00.916 --> 33:04.136
Did you see the way I handled that, Herman?
You're never going to see that woman again.

33:04.211 --> 33:06.555
I'm sure we won't, Ms. Plendor, sir.

33:06.630 --> 33:09.759
She thinks just because she's rich
she doesn't have to play by the rules.

33:13.512 --> 33:16.561
I can't believe
he's taking her to the Dodger game.

33:16.973 --> 33:20.898
It's batting helmet day,
and she's not even under 14.

33:20.977 --> 33:22.650
Don't bet on it.

33:23.438 --> 33:25.987
I guess he's divorcing both of us.

33:27.818 --> 33:29.161
I know you feel bad, honey,

33:29.236 --> 33:32.866
but try to remember
that Dad's going through a phase right now.

33:32.948 --> 33:35.827
It's called being a big jerk.

33:42.958 --> 33:46.258
This is very interesting.

33:47.838 --> 33:49.340
What does that represent?

33:50.799 --> 33:53.426
It's the source of power
that allows a brave to defend his home

33:53.509 --> 33:56.353
and destroy his enemies, right, Mom?

33:57.138 --> 33:59.266
Nix on the "Mom" business.

33:59.348 --> 34:02.101
Sorry, Ms. Plendor, sir.

34:04.311 --> 34:09.533
Look at those adorable little red feathers,
and your patches, those are fabulous.

34:09.608 --> 34:13.737
- They really bring your uniforms to life.
- Thank you, ma'am.

34:13.821 --> 34:18.918
- Where can I buy those?
- You don't buy them. You have to earn them.

34:18.993 --> 34:21.337
Right, like jewelry.

34:23.038 --> 34:25.291
- Damn.
- What's wrong?

34:25.373 --> 34:27.422
I was sure she'd quit.

34:28.835 --> 34:33.056
Here's Claire, who you might recognize
from television,

34:33.132 --> 34:34.804
and she's wearing a backpack.

34:34.884 --> 34:39.435
Of course, it may look
like an ordinary, high-quality backpack, but...

34:39.513 --> 34:44.268
When we lift the flap and pop the snap...

34:47.897 --> 34:51.527
Just because you're out in the woods,
it's no excuse not to look your best.

34:51.609 --> 34:55.237
- You call that a wilderness craft?
- Where are you guys from, Mars?

34:55.320 --> 34:57.072
Worse. Beverly Hills.

35:08.374 --> 35:13.505
I want that woman out, Herman.
She's a threat to everything we stand for.

35:14.589 --> 35:17.342
I'm gonna assign you
as Assistant Troop Leader.

35:17.425 --> 35:20.554
You can infiltrate her organization,
win her trust.

35:21.387 --> 35:23.481
And then you can get the goods on her.

35:23.556 --> 35:26.901
We are going to form
a dossier of information on her.

35:27.227 --> 35:29.025
I know you know best,

35:29.103 --> 35:32.778
but does that jive with the ideals
of the Wilderness Girl Promise?

35:33.650 --> 35:35.869
Promise? I'll give you a promise, Herman.

35:35.944 --> 35:40.825
I promise you'll be back at Kmart selling
those yarn balls if you don't follow orders.

35:40.907 --> 35:42.580
No.

35:42.659 --> 35:46.334
Hello, Mrs. Nefler.
This is Annie Herman. Remember me?

35:46.412 --> 35:49.632
Of course I remember you, Annie.

35:49.707 --> 35:53.461
You're the gal Friday
to our fearless leader, n'est-ce <i>pas?</i>

35:53.544 --> 35:56.388
Yes. Ms. Plendor was...

35:56.463 --> 36:01.390
I was wondering if I could offer my services
to you <i>as</i> an assistant troop leader.

36:01.468 --> 36:03.766
You know, I really could use some help.

36:03.845 --> 36:07.520
The parents in this neighborhood
are so self-involved.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.648
Shit, I broke a nail.

36:11.520 --> 36:14.273
Okay, okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

36:15.983 --> 36:17.326
She bought it.

36:56.105 --> 36:57.152
Testing.

36:57.231 --> 37:00.451
<i>Ready, lift. And down.</i>

37:00.526 --> 37:03.245
<i>Exhale, inhale down.</i>

37:05.489 --> 37:07.207
<i>Don't arch your back.</i>

37:07.283 --> 37:12.414
<i>A full range of motion, exhale up,
inhale down.</i>

37:13.372 --> 37:15.966
<i>Lift and down. You can do it. Come on!</i>

37:16.042 --> 37:20.092
<i>Up, keep breathing. Exhale up.</i>

37:20.171 --> 37:22.265
<i>Keep breathing, now lift.</i>

37:23.132 --> 37:26.727
<i>And down. Two and down.</i>

37:26.802 --> 37:29.430
<i>Keep looking straight ahead.</i>

37:29.513 --> 37:30.981
<i>And</i> down.

37:31.057 --> 37:35.028
<i>For a full range of motion. Exhale up.</i>

37:35.102 --> 37:37.230
<i>Very controlled.</i>

37:37.313 --> 37:39.907
<i>Exhale. Inhale.</i>

37:58.416 --> 37:59.588
Thanks.

38:06.716 --> 38:09.720
Girls, I'd like you
to welcome Ms. Annie Herman,

38:09.803 --> 38:14.183
who has very graciously volunteered
to be our new Assistant Troop Leader.

38:14.265 --> 38:16.438
- Hello.
- Hi.

38:17.560 --> 38:21.861
Okay, well, let's sit in the friendship circle
and welcome Ms. Herman.

38:27.028 --> 38:28.826
Join hands, please.

38:31.700 --> 38:37.707
Okay, now, who would like to be first
to volunteer a thought or a feeling,

38:37.789 --> 38:39.166
share something with us?

38:41.459 --> 38:43.052
This troop sucks.

38:46.631 --> 38:49.885
Okay. Does everybody feel like that?

38:49.968 --> 38:52.221
- Yeah.
- Chica?

38:53.471 --> 38:56.599
At the crafts fair,
we made complete fools of ourselves.

38:56.682 --> 38:59.731
Those creepy Red Feathers
laughed in our faces.

38:59.810 --> 39:03.690
They had a right to.
Did you see all those patches?

39:04.189 --> 39:08.365
Yeah, they know how to do everything.
We can't do anything.

39:09.445 --> 39:12.449
Well, let's face it. We're weird.

39:13.657 --> 39:16.251
- We're losers.
- Really.

39:16.326 --> 39:20.581
I hate to say it, Mom, but you know it's true.

39:20.664 --> 39:25.465
Okay, we're not robust mountain women
<i>as</i> yet.

39:25.544 --> 39:29.094
But that doesn't mean
we can't be crackerjack Wilderness Girls

39:29.173 --> 39:31.050
with plenty of patches.

39:31.133 --> 39:34.558
We could make up our own patches,
couldn't we, Annie?

39:34.636 --> 39:36.809
- Pardon?
- I'm sure it's very nice

39:36.889 --> 39:39.938
to know how to live in the forest
and eat bark,

39:40.017 --> 39:43.817
but I'm going to show you girls

39:43.896 --> 39:47.571
how to survive in the wilds of Beverly Hills.

40:30.274 --> 40:32.493
- More cappuccino, girls?
- Yes, please.

40:32.568 --> 40:35.742
- I'm fine.
- A croissant might be nice.

40:42.411 --> 40:45.460
Please don't bother.
I'll just shave it when I get home.

40:45.540 --> 40:48.259
Mrs. Nefler said to give you the works.

40:58.885 --> 41:00.512
Interesting color.

41:00.595 --> 41:02.643
Remarkable clarity.

41:02.722 --> 41:04.269
A fine cut.

41:04.349 --> 41:07.694
I'd say 82 thou.

41:08.353 --> 41:10.572
- That's amazing.
-Isn't it'?

41:11.314 --> 41:14.193
- And it's called a canary diamond?
- Yes.

41:14.276 --> 41:17.029
- Does it sing?
- No.

41:18.738 --> 41:20.456
Yes, it does.

41:29.791 --> 41:32.715
Okay, let's begin with the Frug.

41:32.794 --> 41:34.671
Maestro, if you please.

42:07.578 --> 42:11.208
And this one's called the Freddie.

42:11.290 --> 42:13.042
I know, life is so ironic.

42:22.760 --> 42:25.639
Hi, girls. My name is Officer Bill,

42:25.721 --> 42:31.273
and today I am here to demonstrate for you
cardiopulmonary resuscitation,

42:31.352 --> 42:34.731
more commonly known <i>as</i> CPR.

42:36.357 --> 42:38.451
So, I'll need a volunteer.

42:38.525 --> 42:40.198
- Me!
- You.

42:40.277 --> 42:43.030
- No, I don't think that's...
- No, no, don't be shy.

42:43.113 --> 42:45.741
This'll be very informative.
The girls will love it.

42:45.824 --> 42:48.168
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt.

42:51.121 --> 42:54.045
Now lie down and open your mouth.

42:57.211 --> 43:01.431
The last time I did this,
I got more than a patch for it.

43:01.506 --> 43:03.133
Thanks so much.

43:33.997 --> 43:37.547
- Would you like a magazine?
- I don't want to read New <i>Woman.</i>

43:37.625 --> 43:39.127
How about this?

43:39.210 --> 43:40.211
<i>I hate Cosmo.</i>

43:40.920 --> 43:42.342
How about this?

44:04.109 --> 44:05.986
You guys are fantastic!

44:08.822 --> 44:11.621
Wait. Hold up. Hold up.

44:14.119 --> 44:15.746
Keep dancing!

44:23.712 --> 44:27.512
Mr. Michaelson, is your client
planning to be here or not?

44:27.591 --> 44:30.219
Your Honor,
my client should be here momentarily.

44:33.722 --> 44:35.690
I'm sorry we're late, Your Honor.

44:35.766 --> 44:40.192
My troop and I were busy
describing the fall fashions to the blind.

44:40.270 --> 44:43.490
One man said
he could actually feel the colors.

44:43.815 --> 44:45.032
It was inspirational.

44:45.108 --> 44:47.736
Come on, Phyllis, what is this?

44:47.819 --> 44:50.413
It's a Van Runkle. Isn't it fabulous?

44:50.489 --> 44:51.706
Stunning.

44:52.365 --> 44:56.916
Anyway, the workings
of the wonderful American judiciary system

44:56.995 --> 44:59.248
are something
that every child should witness,

44:59.331 --> 45:01.254
especially with a woman like you in charge.

45:03.250 --> 45:06.003
Well, I guess it's all right. Okay.

45:07.338 --> 45:08.681
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.

45:09.215 --> 45:10.717
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, sweetie.

45:11.634 --> 45:14.729
We're here to attest
to the division of property

45:14.804 --> 45:20.026
in the temporary support hearing
of Nefler <i>v.</i> Nefler.

45:22.144 --> 45:25.569
I will set a court date
for six weeks from today.

45:25.648 --> 45:30.279
Your Honor, my client would like to petition
for an earlier court date if possible.

45:30.361 --> 45:33.490
So what's the rush? What is this, Reno?

45:33.572 --> 45:35.700
Never go to Reno, girls.

45:35.783 --> 45:38.627
The California community property laws
can't be beat.

45:41.622 --> 45:43.624
The fact of the matter is, Your Honor,

45:43.707 --> 45:47.302
my client may be considering remarriage.

46:04.936 --> 46:07.735
How can she subject
those innocent children to this?

46:08.064 --> 46:09.737
She's really sick.

46:13.987 --> 46:17.662
Until this moment,
I never believed we were really through.

46:17.740 --> 46:22.416
Don't give up, Mom.
He'll never really marry her.

46:25.248 --> 46:29.003
It's just a typical male midlife crisis.

46:29.085 --> 46:32.885
See, he's got to prove
that he's still sexually attractive.

46:32.964 --> 46:34.341
My dad's been going through it.

46:35.258 --> 46:36.475
How long?

46:36.551 --> 46:37.598
Eleven years.

46:42.307 --> 46:44.105
I need some jewelry.

46:52.859 --> 46:54.281
Divorce Court patch.

46:57.614 --> 46:59.366
Hopefully to be followed by

46:59.449 --> 47:04.295
the remarriage-to-someone-better-
brighter-and-more-appreciative-of-me patch.

47:06.663 --> 47:07.664
Yeah.

47:10.292 --> 47:11.714
And that's why

47:11.793 --> 47:16.469
the American Indian is responsible
for the turquoise jewelry movement.

47:18.508 --> 47:22.138
That makes 36 patches in three weeks.

47:22.971 --> 47:25.941
I can't believe that. That's so great.

47:26.016 --> 47:27.563
Is that a record or something, Annie?

47:27.643 --> 47:29.145
-It's unbelievable.
- Yeah.

47:29.228 --> 47:30.571
When do we get our patches?

47:30.646 --> 47:33.490
You get your patches at the patch ceremony.

47:33.565 --> 47:37.286
It's a little do I'm cooking up.
It'll be at the marina on a boat.

47:37.361 --> 47:40.114
And we'll invite your parents, and
we'll have great goodies, and you'll love it.

47:40.197 --> 47:42.700
And the only thing you have to do
is bring $750 for the patches,

47:43.492 --> 47:45.790
and please RSVP by Thursday.

47:46.954 --> 47:51.084
I'm not coming. It's stupid. It's stupid.

47:51.166 --> 47:52.213
Emily!

47:59.174 --> 48:00.642
What happened?

48:01.009 --> 48:03.853
It's because of the $750. She doesn't have it.

48:06.264 --> 48:07.641
Emily!

48:09.267 --> 48:13.693
Wait up, hon! Em! Yo, Em! Wait up!

48:15.356 --> 48:18.986
Emily! Emily, stop! Will you stop?

48:19.068 --> 48:20.695
I'm sorry!

48:21.737 --> 48:23.034
Thank you.

48:24.365 --> 48:27.118
I haven't been to Jazzercise in three weeks.

48:27.201 --> 48:29.044
I don't have the money.

48:31.247 --> 48:34.217
Sit down. Come on, sit down.

48:36.961 --> 48:38.053
Okay.

48:40.381 --> 48:42.759
Emily, I want to tell you a story

48:44.218 --> 48:47.973
about a woman
who lived right here in Beverly Hills

48:48.055 --> 48:51.400
and thought
that money was pretty darn important.

48:52.310 --> 48:57.032
One day, she went to Neiman Marcus
for the linen sale,

48:57.106 --> 49:01.987
and she got these fabulous duvets,
and shams and dust ruffles at 50% off,

49:02.069 --> 49:04.163
two hundred-thread count.

49:04.238 --> 49:07.958
And then she went to pay for them,

49:08.033 --> 49:15.008
and the salesgirl cut her credit card in half
in front of a lot of people.

49:15.790 --> 49:18.964
- Did you have to put everything back?
- Yes.

49:19.753 --> 49:22.427
- Wasn't it embarrassing?
-It was a nightmare.

49:22.505 --> 49:25.975
I thought I could never show my face
on Wilshire again.

49:27.260 --> 49:29.763
But I was wrong.

49:29.846 --> 49:32.599
These things happen.
They happen to everyone.

49:35.935 --> 49:39.064
Having money isn't the most important thing.

49:41.608 --> 49:44.703
The most important thing is having friends.

49:45.653 --> 49:48.031
Especially friends with money.

49:51.326 --> 49:52.703
Thank you.

49:53.995 --> 49:55.793
And the interest is only 10% a week.

49:57.040 --> 50:00.169
- Just kidding.
- Thanks.

50:00.251 --> 50:02.094
You guys are fabulous.

50:25.984 --> 50:29.409
Chica, I'm so sorry
that your parents couldn't come today.

50:29.488 --> 50:30.831
They're in Caracas.

50:30.906 --> 50:34.080
Besides, I wouldn't have
invited them anyway.

50:34.159 --> 50:37.038
I think she's really warming up, don't you?

50:39.456 --> 50:42.335
Can I have that wine over there?

50:42.418 --> 50:43.920
This needs something.

50:44.002 --> 50:46.801
You can't put wine in hobo stew!

50:46.880 --> 50:50.726
Well, of course you can.
What goes better with hobos than wine?

50:54.847 --> 50:58.317
And in addition to the patches
earned by all the girls,

50:58.392 --> 51:03.444
I am proud to present to Tiffany Honigman
the friendship patch,

51:04.356 --> 51:08.781
the shopping patch,
and the jewelry-appraisal patch.

51:13.698 --> 51:15.120
Honey.

51:16.742 --> 51:17.868
Good.

51:20.079 --> 51:22.127
And to Lily Marcigan,

51:22.206 --> 51:26.302
for teaching us how to launder money
and crush a revolution,

51:26.377 --> 51:29.426
I'm proud to present
the international-affairs patch.

51:29.505 --> 51:31.007
Congratulations.

51:32.300 --> 51:33.677
Well done.

51:35.011 --> 51:39.482
And to my lovely daughter, Hannah,
I'm proud to present the best-daughter patch.

51:39.557 --> 51:41.730
- Mom!
- Just kidding. Just kidding. I'm sorry. Okay.

51:41.809 --> 51:43.857
To this total stranger, Hannah Nefler,

51:43.936 --> 51:47.907
I'm proud to present
the sushi-appreciation patch,

51:48.441 --> 51:52.821
the fire-prevention patch,
and the gardening-with-glamour patch.

51:52.904 --> 51:54.656
I'm so proud of you.

51:55.114 --> 51:56.115
Fred!

52:02.038 --> 52:05.713
Lisa, too bad! Are you okay, honey?

52:05.791 --> 52:08.089
No, damn it! Throw me a lifesaver!

52:08.419 --> 52:09.920
No problem.

52:11.588 --> 52:13.807
Butterscotch or Wintergreen?

52:13.882 --> 52:15.350
- What?
- Man.

52:15.425 --> 52:19.305
Stop. She'll be all right. Silicon is buoyant.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.318
Encouraging drunkenness.

52:27.354 --> 52:29.448
Materialism at its worst.

52:31.066 --> 52:32.192
Bribery.

52:33.276 --> 52:35.529
This woman is a complete degenerate.

52:37.614 --> 52:40.743
I think the evidence I have shown here

52:40.825 --> 52:43.874
proves conclusively,
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

52:43.954 --> 52:47.675
that the Beverly Hills troop
should be stripped of their uniforms

52:47.749 --> 52:49.467
and officially disbanded.

52:49.543 --> 52:54.049
And that Nefler woman
should be tossed out on her butt.

52:54.130 --> 52:56.599
Tell me something, Velda.

52:56.675 --> 52:59.428
How did you collect all this information?

52:59.511 --> 53:02.060
Well, I cannot reveal my sources.

53:02.138 --> 53:07.941
Your sources show that Mrs. Nefler
has taken an active interest in these girls

53:08.019 --> 53:11.864
and perhaps this troop
has finally found its niche.

53:13.274 --> 53:16.118
I think we'll keep her on for a while.

53:18.279 --> 53:19.997
And by the way, Velda,

53:20.072 --> 53:25.499
we don't go around
tossing our leaders out on their butts.

53:28.163 --> 53:30.962
I guess that means I don't have
to spy on Mrs. Nefler anymore.

53:31.041 --> 53:32.793
Wrong!

53:32.876 --> 53:36.972
Because now is the time
that we have to redouble our efforts.

53:39.508 --> 53:42.762
I think I'll have you move in
with that Nefler woman.

53:42.845 --> 53:45.268
That way, nothing will get past you.

53:45.347 --> 53:47.020
Move in with her?

53:47.099 --> 53:50.945
Attention, Kmart shoppers.

53:51.020 --> 53:54.365
Blue light special, aisle 13.

53:55.899 --> 54:00.951
The fumigator said I may not be able
to go back into my apartment for weeks.

54:01.030 --> 54:03.032
Well, you can stay here as long <i>as</i> you like.

54:03.699 --> 54:06.248
That's awfully nice of you.

54:06.660 --> 54:11.086
So what do you do for fun?
Do you have a boyfriend or anything?

54:11.165 --> 54:13.633
Well, it depends on
what you mean by boyfriend.

54:13.708 --> 54:16.803
If you mean a man I go out with...

54:16.878 --> 54:18.175
No.

54:19.047 --> 54:21.721
If you mean like a boy who's just a friend...

54:23.217 --> 54:24.218
No.

54:26.054 --> 54:31.982
Excuse me, Mrs. Nefler. It's Chica.
She's downstairs. She seems really upset.

54:32.060 --> 54:34.188
Chica? Upset?

54:35.146 --> 54:36.898
How can you tell?

54:38.858 --> 54:42.283
Chica? What's wrong, sweetheart?

54:43.237 --> 54:45.660
I'd better go.
It was stupid of me to come over here.

54:45.740 --> 54:48.414
No. Sit down. Let's talk.

54:48.910 --> 54:50.002
I'd better go.

54:50.078 --> 54:53.673
Well, at least wait
until I call your parents to pick you up.

54:53.748 --> 54:56.092
My parents are in Monte-Carlo!

54:58.169 --> 55:00.888
Well, I guess it will be a while
before they get here.

55:01.422 --> 55:06.679
It was a last-minute trip.
They didn't mean to leave me on my birthday.

55:13.642 --> 55:15.235
I'm sure they didn't.

55:15.727 --> 55:17.775
They forgot her birthday.

55:20.399 --> 55:23.152
I'm sure they love you very much.

55:25.696 --> 55:27.664
Just give me 10 minutes.

55:35.288 --> 55:40.044
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

55:40.127 --> 55:43.597
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

55:43.672 --> 55:49.145
<i>Happy birthday, dear Chica</i>

55:49.219 --> 55:55.568
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

56:01.314 --> 56:04.659
<i>And remember, any hard-working troop</i>

56:05.819 --> 56:11.576
<i>that sells more than 1,000 boxes
will attend the annual Jamboree.</i>

56:11.992 --> 56:16.747
That Jamboree thing sounds fabulous.
My troop is definitely going.

56:16.829 --> 56:18.081
What is a Jamboree?

56:18.164 --> 56:21.088
<i>I love the smell of cookies in the morning.</i>

56:21.167 --> 56:23.090
<i>All right, let's begin with the M's.</i>

56:26.005 --> 56:27.302
Happy cookie day.

56:27.381 --> 56:30.430
I know you're very busy,
but I wanted you to know

56:30.509 --> 56:35.356
that my girls have earned oodles of patches,
and in record time too.

56:35.431 --> 56:38.105
I am fully aware of what your troop has done.

56:38.184 --> 56:39.606
- Good, good.
- I happen to know

56:39.685 --> 56:44.782
that those so-called patches have nothing
to do with Wilderness ways as I know them

56:44.857 --> 56:46.905
or anyone else
in their right mind knows them.

56:46.984 --> 56:49.908
- I know that...
- I have spoken with Frances Temple,

56:49.987 --> 56:52.206
and I do hereby revoke said patches

56:52.281 --> 56:56.912
so that you and those little froo-froos
do not prance around with them illicitly.

56:56.994 --> 56:59.247
- Please, don't...
- Please nothing.

56:59.330 --> 57:02.209
You will turn them in
before you leave here today!

57:02.291 --> 57:04.544
Now, get off my dock.

57:06.629 --> 57:10.600
<i>Let's start with Mar Vista.
How many boxes will you take, Mar Vista?</i>

57:10.674 --> 57:13.723
<i>- Forty.
- How many? I can't hear you, Mar Vista!</i>

57:13.803 --> 57:15.270
Forty-two?

57:16.471 --> 57:17.768
<i>Next!</i>

57:20.266 --> 57:24.521
<i>Culver City,
the lovely and talented Red Feathers.</i>

57:24.604 --> 57:27.858
<i>How many boxes are
you little soldiers going to take?</i>

57:27.941 --> 57:31.286
<i>- One thousand.
- All right.</i>

57:32.529 --> 57:34.531
Well, maybe
Velda doesn't understand our patches,

57:34.614 --> 57:38.289
but I'll tell you something
she does understand, cookies.

57:38.368 --> 57:40.996
And I think we could sell enough
that we could make her eat her words.

57:41.079 --> 57:42.831
What do you think?

57:42.914 --> 57:45.963
She can have the patches.
I'm still a Wilderness Girl.

57:47.252 --> 57:48.344
Thank you.

57:48.419 --> 57:52.640
No big deal.
Too many accessories clutter an outfit.

57:53.508 --> 57:54.680
Yes, they do.

57:54.759 --> 57:58.514
Normally, I'd ask for a refund,
but this one's on the house.

58:00.598 --> 58:04.978
Patches. We don't need no stinking patches!

58:05.770 --> 58:08.489
Now how many boxes of cookies
are we gonna sell?

58:10.775 --> 58:12.743
You didn't call Beverly Hills!

58:14.571 --> 58:16.288
<i>Beverly Hills.</i>

58:16.363 --> 58:18.457
Two thousand boxes!

58:20.784 --> 58:21.876
<i>Right.</i>

58:22.911 --> 58:25.414
- Hi. What a lovely shirt you're wearing.
- Why, thank you.

58:25.497 --> 58:27.215
Would you like to buy
some Wilderness Girls cookies?

58:27.291 --> 58:28.543
It's for a very good cause.

58:28.625 --> 58:30.218
I'm sorry. I already bought some.

58:30.294 --> 58:31.841
- From who?
- You did?

58:31.920 --> 58:34.093
From the cute little girls
with the red feathers in their hats.

58:34.464 --> 58:35.636
Sorry.

58:38.969 --> 58:40.266
Hi.

58:42.472 --> 58:45.897
Hello. We're selling cookies.
It's for a very good cause.

58:45.976 --> 58:47.068
Would you like to buy some?

58:47.144 --> 58:50.569
I would, but I just bought four boxes
from your friends.

58:50.647 --> 58:52.490
You did?

58:52.566 --> 58:53.818
- Our friends?
- Our friends?

58:53.901 --> 58:55.869
Yeah, you know, the ones with red feathers?

58:56.278 --> 58:57.495
Sorry.

58:59.156 --> 59:00.533
- Red feathers.
- Red feathers.

59:00.616 --> 59:02.118
Thank you, ma'am.

59:11.335 --> 59:15.056
- We did it, Mom!
- Nix on the "Mom" business.

59:16.006 --> 59:19.885
Those stinking Horse Feathers
covered every inch of our turf.

59:21.385 --> 59:25.390
I don't understand it.
They deliberately ruined it for our girls.

59:25.473 --> 59:29.103
That's not what this organization's all about,
is it?

59:29.185 --> 59:33.065
Well, there are some people
in the organization, one in particular,

59:33.147 --> 59:35.445
who believe
that winning is what's important,

59:35.524 --> 59:38.619
no matter who you have to step on
along the way.

01:00:02.426 --> 01:00:05.521
So as parents and friends,

01:00:05.596 --> 01:00:09.100
you have a wonderful opportunity
to help our troop

01:00:09.183 --> 01:00:12.528
and support these fabulous little girls.

01:00:12.603 --> 01:00:13.604
What do you think?

01:00:13.688 --> 01:00:18.614
Look, if all you're trying to do
is to sell 2,000 boxes of cookies,

01:00:18.692 --> 01:00:20.069
why don't we just buy them?

01:00:20.443 --> 01:00:22.821
Well, I know. I know.
I thought about that too.

01:00:22.904 --> 01:00:24.497
But you know, it misses the point.

01:00:24.572 --> 01:00:28.327
The girls need a chance
to get their neighbors involved, you know?

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:30.583
It enhances community spirit.

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:38.841
Would you excuse me just a moment?
Annie, will you take over?

01:00:44.759 --> 01:00:46.887
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, hon.

01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:48.062
Good night, sweetie.

01:00:51.641 --> 01:00:53.860
I believe you're being paged.

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.899
Boy, there's quite a crowd in there,
isn't there?

01:00:57.981 --> 01:01:00.609
Well, you've got your peanut butter.
You've got your vanilla.

01:01:00.692 --> 01:01:02.660
You've got your creams which are...

01:01:02.736 --> 01:01:04.864
How about you? How's the new condo?

01:01:05.321 --> 01:01:07.790
It's great. It's great, yeah.

01:01:07.866 --> 01:01:10.369
Got some furniture
from Divorced-Guys-R-Us.

01:01:10.452 --> 01:01:11.544
Yeah.

01:01:12.871 --> 01:01:14.123
Yeah.

01:01:18.084 --> 01:01:21.508
It'd be nice if you stayed
for the parents' meeting, you know?

01:01:21.587 --> 01:01:24.591
- It would mean a lot to Hannah.
- Gosh, I can't. I mean, I got...

01:01:24.673 --> 01:01:26.892
Come on. Look, it's just an hour.

01:01:26.967 --> 01:01:30.892
She can pull into the garage and wait

01:01:30.971 --> 01:01:32.314
with the motor running.

01:01:39.813 --> 01:01:41.736
That certainly took long enough.

01:01:41.815 --> 01:01:43.909
I thought maybe
you decided to move back in.

01:01:43.984 --> 01:01:45.782
Sorry.

01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:48.831
Well, what does she want from you now?

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:52.956
Well, she wanted me to stay
for a meeting about Hannah's troop.

01:01:53.869 --> 01:01:57.464
Take, take, take.
Boy, that woman's on a total trip.

01:01:57.539 --> 01:02:00.338
Well, the Wilderness Girls
are real important to Hannah, you know.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:02.044
And golly, I don't even know what to do.

01:02:02.127 --> 01:02:05.927
You're too young to understand this,
but she'll always be my wife.

01:02:06.006 --> 01:02:07.849
What?

01:02:07.925 --> 01:02:10.053
I said, "She'll always be my daughter."

01:02:10.135 --> 01:02:13.355
You said, "She'll always be my wife."

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.354
- I couldn't have said that.
- But you did.

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:18.731
Well, I made a huge mistake.

01:02:18.811 --> 01:02:21.404
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

01:02:24.148 --> 01:02:26.116
Look, it's obvious
we don't have a solution here.

01:02:26.192 --> 01:02:27.409
Phyllis, what's your plan?

01:02:27.485 --> 01:02:29.328
The girls and I talked about this,

01:02:29.403 --> 01:02:32.623
and we came up with some great ideas
to get the whole community involved.

01:02:32.698 --> 01:02:33.824
For example.

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:42.129
<i>Gather around, you friends of mine</i>

01:02:42.208 --> 01:02:45.678
<i>We're Wilderness Girls, and it's cookie time</i>

01:02:45.753 --> 01:02:49.257
<i>We work hard, and we play fair</i>

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:53.470
<i>So buy a box and do your share</i>

01:02:53.553 --> 01:02:57.308
<i>- If you want the best taste you can find
- Yeah, yeah</i>

01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:01.145
<i>- Chocolate chips are one of</i> a <i>kind
- Yeah, yeah</i>

01:03:01.227 --> 01:03:05.824
<i>- Our peanut butter treats will blow your mind
- Yeah, yeah</i>

01:03:05.898 --> 01:03:08.617
<i>- A box of them would be so nice
- Box of</i>

01:03:08.693 --> 01:03:12.664
<i>- Cheap at even twice the price
- Twice the</i>

01:03:12.738 --> 01:03:16.493
<i>I said come on down, come on down
It's cookie time</i>

01:03:16.576 --> 01:03:20.206
<i>It's cookie time
It's cookie time</i>

01:03:20.287 --> 01:03:23.632
<i>It's cookie time, cookie time, cookie time</i>

01:03:28.503 --> 01:03:29.629
Here, catch!

01:03:29.713 --> 01:03:33.468
I've got two dollars. Exact change.
Thank you.

01:03:37.804 --> 01:03:42.480
Cigars, cigarettes, cookies.
Cigars, cigarettes.

01:03:42.642 --> 01:03:44.690
Peanut butter or mint?

01:03:44.769 --> 01:03:47.522
- Do you take American Express?
- We prefer Visa.

01:03:48.023 --> 01:03:51.197
<i>Cookies always cause such a fuss</i>

01:03:51.276 --> 01:03:55.281
<i>Full of sugar and spice
Just like us</i>

01:03:55.614 --> 01:03:58.868
<i>We need your dough, so don't you pause</i>

01:03:59.242 --> 01:04:03.167
<i>We're Wilderness Girls
And we're a real good cause</i>

01:04:03.246 --> 01:04:06.967
<i>- If you want</i> a <i>taste that's nice and sweet
- Yeah, yeah</i>

01:04:07.042 --> 01:04:10.672
<i>- You won't find something better to eat
- Yeah, yeah</i>

01:04:10.795 --> 01:04:14.641
<i>- Doesn't your mouth deserve a treat?
- Yeah, yeah</i>

01:04:14.758 --> 01:04:18.388
<i>- A box of them would be so nice
- Nice</i>

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:20.893
<i>Cheap at even twice the price</i>

01:04:35.986 --> 01:04:38.284
- I'm not ruining your diet.
- Two dollars.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.334
Ms. Pia Zadora.

01:04:45.246 --> 01:04:49.296
She is smashingly sheathed
in this season's hottest style,

01:04:49.375 --> 01:04:51.048
the Wilderness look.

01:04:53.837 --> 01:04:54.929
Would you like to buy some cookies?

01:04:55.381 --> 01:04:57.930
- Would you like some cookies?
- Yes.

01:04:58.008 --> 01:04:59.851
You have to buy them.

01:04:59.927 --> 01:05:01.645
Dr. Joyce Brothers.

01:05:06.141 --> 01:05:10.692
Clad in khaki for a lunch
at Ie bistro or a walk in the woods.

01:05:14.858 --> 01:05:17.782
My broker <i>says</i> it's a fabulous investment.

01:05:17.861 --> 01:05:19.408
Mrs. Phyllis Nefler.

01:05:23.032 --> 01:05:26.832
Mrs. Nefler is the culprit
behind this khaki mania.

01:05:26.911 --> 01:05:32.008
And her ensemble
is the epitome of this season's hottest trend.

01:05:34.877 --> 01:05:36.879
Your mom is so cool.

01:05:36.963 --> 01:05:39.136
She put this whole thing together.

01:05:39.215 --> 01:05:41.468
Yeah. She's amazing.

01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:45.138
- I just wish my dad could see it.
- Yeah.

01:05:47.557 --> 01:05:48.649
Thank you, Robin.

01:05:48.725 --> 01:05:53.231
And if you loved our <i>haute</i> couture,
you'll adore our haute cuisine.

01:05:53.313 --> 01:05:55.236
Buy some cookies today.

01:05:56.649 --> 01:05:59.744
It's khaki wishes and cookie dreams.

01:06:01.571 --> 01:06:02.697
You are so fabulous.

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.157
- No, you're fabulous.
- No, you...

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.119
- No, you.
- You're fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.

01:06:11.539 --> 01:06:14.167
<i>- Plendor here.
- Velda, Phyllis Nefler.</i>

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:18.255
Listen, I had a little surprise for you.
We didn't sell 2,000 boxes of cookies.

01:06:18.755 --> 01:06:21.178
Well, that's no surprise to me.
I knew you couldn't.

01:06:21.257 --> 01:06:27.889
<i>We sold 4,732 boxes. Isn't that fabulous?</i>

01:06:27.971 --> 01:06:30.690
<i>Listen, the Barnfells
are throwing a gala this evening,</i>

01:06:30.766 --> 01:06:34.145
and we'd love you to be there
for the check presentation.

01:06:34.227 --> 01:06:40.655
8:00-ish, black tie, 7O Hillcrest,
across from that garish Suroc mansion.

01:06:40.734 --> 01:06:42.452
So, see you then.

01:06:51.286 --> 01:06:54.005
It was a warm and sultry evening.

01:06:54.081 --> 01:06:57.210
She looked stunning.
Everything was going wonderfully.

01:06:57.292 --> 01:06:59.761
Thanks for throwing this fabulous party.

01:06:59.836 --> 01:07:01.964
Phyllis, we want to thank you

01:07:02.047 --> 01:07:05.096
for giving our little girl a birthday party
while we were away.

01:07:05.175 --> 01:07:08.054
- I am terrible with dates.
- Yes.

01:07:08.136 --> 01:07:12.516
Everyone was there,
all the Beverly Hills glitterati.

01:07:12.599 --> 01:07:17.776
It all looked so civilized,
but really, it was a black-tied jungle.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:22.075
Tessa told me your idea
about using Emily's dad in my next picture.

01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:26.655
- Well...
- I want you to meet the new mob father.

01:07:31.784 --> 01:07:33.331
Fabulous.

01:07:33.411 --> 01:07:37.166
Thanks so much for helping me out,
helping me get this part.

01:07:37.248 --> 01:07:39.546
I couldn't get a job in this town.

01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:41.798
And Emily thanks you too.

01:07:47.508 --> 01:07:50.102
Mrs. Nefler, meet Cinderella.

01:07:50.886 --> 01:07:54.766
Annie, you look fabulous.

01:07:54.849 --> 01:07:56.317
How did this happen?

01:07:56.392 --> 01:07:59.862
Well, Hannah did my makeup,
and Rosa raided your closet.

01:07:59.937 --> 01:08:01.689
You really like it?

01:08:03.691 --> 01:08:07.241
Excuse me, Cheech? Hi,
I'd like you to meet Annie Herman.

01:08:08.279 --> 01:08:10.498
Annie Herman!

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:14.794
Wanna wrestle?

01:08:14.869 --> 01:08:16.621
Are you related to Pee-wee?

01:08:17.078 --> 01:08:20.299
Madam, would you mind telling me the truth?

01:08:20.374 --> 01:08:23.799
How many pairs of shoes do you really have?

01:08:23.877 --> 01:08:26.676
Why, what are you implying, Mr. Christy?

01:08:27.964 --> 01:08:31.264
Do you like people
to call you Dictator or just Dick'?

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:33.935
Just call me Bong Bong, please.

01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:36.890
- May I call you Phyllis?
- Sure, sure, Bong Bong.

01:08:38.308 --> 01:08:40.652
Troop Leader of the Year?

01:08:40.727 --> 01:08:41.853
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:08:41.935 --> 01:08:44.984
- Sir, may I cut in, dance with my wife?
- Certainly.

01:08:45.064 --> 01:08:47.738
- It was a pleasure, miss.
- And for me.

01:08:48.902 --> 01:08:52.782
Phyl, I got to hand it to you.

01:08:52.863 --> 01:08:55.457
- You did it.
- I did?

01:08:55.533 --> 01:08:59.582
Yeah. I mean,
you turned yourself around completely.

01:09:01.831 --> 01:09:04.254
- Well...
- Yeah.

01:09:04.334 --> 01:09:08.180
I got to tell you something else.
You look great.

01:09:08.254 --> 01:09:13.055
It's different and everything,
but I mean, it's softer somehow.

01:09:14.219 --> 01:09:15.220
Yes.

01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:21.481
So, where's Lisa, or is it past her bedtime?

01:09:21.559 --> 01:09:23.607
Boy, way past, I'll tell you.

01:09:23.685 --> 01:09:25.939
I'm not seeing her anymore.

01:09:28.232 --> 01:09:31.031
No, and I'll tell you something else.

01:09:33.194 --> 01:09:37.450
I am really very, very proud of you.
I just had to say that.

01:09:40.327 --> 01:09:42.876
Well, I'm kind of proud of me too.

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:48.926
And there's something very important
I have to talk to you about.

01:09:53.215 --> 01:09:54.637
Nefler.

01:09:55.801 --> 01:09:58.975
Velda, I'm so glad you could make it.

01:10:00.138 --> 01:10:03.017
This is our commander in chief,
Velda Plendor.

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.570
This is my... This is Freddy Nefler.

01:10:07.854 --> 01:10:11.154
Hey, how you doing? Pleasure to meet you.

01:10:11.233 --> 01:10:15.659
- Well, I guess we can talk about it later?
- Sure, sure, of course we can.

01:10:18.323 --> 01:10:22.328
- So, I guess you have something for me first?
- Yes, abso/ument.

01:10:27.873 --> 01:10:33.505
I want you all to welcome
our esteemed district leader, Velda Plendor,

01:10:33.671 --> 01:10:35.844
who's been gracious enough to stop by

01:10:35.923 --> 01:10:40.474
to acknowledge the achievement of
our fabulous Beverly Hills Wilderness Girls.

01:10:49.103 --> 01:10:51.947
And next it's on to the annual Jamboree

01:10:52.023 --> 01:10:54.025
where our girls will compete

01:10:54.108 --> 01:10:58.033
for the ultimate honor
of being next year's poster troop.

01:10:58.863 --> 01:11:00.615
And we're going to win.

01:11:06.621 --> 01:11:08.623
I guess my big break came
when I was playing Ace,

01:11:08.706 --> 01:11:09.832
a photographer on The <i>Love</i> Boat.

01:11:09.915 --> 01:11:11.838
- You were good.
- Thanks.

01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:14.545
- Do you know Gopher?
- Yeah, he's a good friend of mine.

01:11:16.047 --> 01:11:21.304
You traitor. Look at you, you cheap slut.

01:11:21.385 --> 01:11:24.730
- Your next stop is Kmart.
- Screw you, Velda.

01:11:27.933 --> 01:11:29.855
I don't usually talk that way.

01:11:29.934 --> 01:11:31.527
I liked it.

01:11:31.603 --> 01:11:33.901
You are very sexy. Really.

01:11:36.399 --> 01:11:39.494
So, you don't hate me anymore?

01:11:40.153 --> 01:11:42.952
Fred, I never hated you.

01:11:44.699 --> 01:11:48.329
I was angry with you, and I was hurt.

01:11:49.829 --> 01:11:56.087
But now I realize
that our splitting up was positive.

01:11:58.588 --> 01:12:01.683
- Positive?
- Well, constructive.

01:12:03.718 --> 01:12:07.439
I feel like I've grown a lot
in the last few months.

01:12:08.598 --> 01:12:10.646
Boy, yeah, you really have.

01:12:17.565 --> 01:12:20.614
So what was it
you wanted to talk to me about?

01:12:23.279 --> 01:12:25.953
- Hannah.
- Hannah?

01:12:27.534 --> 01:12:30.286
- Yeah.
- What about Hannah?

01:12:31.036 --> 01:12:33.710
Well, you know, I realize
that ever since we've been separated,

01:12:33.789 --> 01:12:37.919
Phyl, just how much she means to me,

01:12:38.794 --> 01:12:43.800
and I just think that when the divorce is final,
I want joint custody of Hannah.

01:12:43.882 --> 01:12:46.180
That's what you wanted to talk to me about?

01:12:47.553 --> 01:12:49.931
Yeah, and I sure didn't want to hurt you,
Phyl, but you know,

01:12:50.013 --> 01:12:52.983
she's my daughter too,
and I'd like her to spend some time with me,

01:12:53.058 --> 01:12:55.857
say, like, on the weekends.
I'd like to get through...

01:12:56.937 --> 01:12:58.655
Good night, Freddy.

01:13:01.316 --> 01:13:06.789
Help! I'm drowning. God. I'm...

01:13:18.876 --> 01:13:21.675
Hi, going through a divorce.

01:13:27.801 --> 01:13:29.269
Come in.

01:13:29.344 --> 01:13:32.313
Hannah, I washed your yellow sweatshirt.

01:13:33.639 --> 01:13:34.856
Thanks, Mom.

01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:38.778
Rosa will be back before you do
any more of my laundry, won't she?

01:13:38.853 --> 01:13:41.857
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Where'd she go, anyway?

01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:45.364
- Mexico. Her grandmother died.
- Again'?

01:13:47.779 --> 01:13:51.204
You're taking your Laura Ashley doll?

01:13:51.282 --> 01:13:54.377
Dad thought
I should keep some stuff at his house.

01:13:55.244 --> 01:13:57.713
There's plenty food in the freezer.

01:13:57.789 --> 01:14:00.793
If you need anything, just call me.
You've got Dad's number.

01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:02.502
And don't stay up too late, okay?

01:14:02.585 --> 01:14:06.806
Thank you. I'm a grown-up person.
I think I can take care of myself.

01:14:08.216 --> 01:14:11.186
- Are you ready, Peaches?
- Coming, Dad.

01:14:12.512 --> 01:14:15.482
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye. Have fun.

01:14:16.557 --> 01:14:19.026
- I love you, Hannah.
- Love you too.

01:14:28.653 --> 01:14:29.905
Hannah?

01:14:33.448 --> 01:14:35.917
Did you forget something, honey?

01:14:36.785 --> 01:14:40.085
I bet you thought that was pretty cute
last night, didn't you, Nefler?

01:14:40.163 --> 01:14:42.291
- What?
- Putting on that little show

01:14:42.374 --> 01:14:44.843
for all your hotsy-totsy friends?

01:14:45.836 --> 01:14:47.634
Well, you didn't just embarrass me.

01:14:47.712 --> 01:14:50.340
You embarrassed
the Wilderness Girls of America.

01:14:51.883 --> 01:14:55.387
I never intended on embarrassing anyone.

01:14:56.054 --> 01:14:57.522
You're dangerous, Nefler.

01:14:57.931 --> 01:15:03.529
You think this is all a game, don't you?
Well, my Jamboree is no joke.

01:15:03.603 --> 01:15:08.450
That's the real wilderness out there.
That's not some Beverly Hills backyard.

01:15:08.525 --> 01:15:13.122
You got mountains, swamps, wild animals.

01:15:13.738 --> 01:15:15.581
They don't take credit cards.

01:15:15.657 --> 01:15:17.204
I'm warning you, Nefler.

01:15:17.909 --> 01:15:22.164
Somebody is gonna get hurt,
and it's gonna be all your fault.

01:15:26.376 --> 01:15:31.473
Well, the reason you're winning
is I got grease on my controller.

01:15:33.883 --> 01:15:36.682
- Want some more pizza?
- I'm stuffed.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.479
- How about some more soda?
- No, I'm fine.

01:15:39.555 --> 01:15:42.525
You're tired of the game?
Okay, let's go to 31 Flavors.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.729
- I'm ready. Come on.
- Dad, will you please stop?

01:15:45.811 --> 01:15:48.610
You don't have to feed me
and entertain me every second.

01:15:50.649 --> 01:15:51.992
You mean, I'm trying too hard?

01:15:53.402 --> 01:15:54.949
A little.

01:15:58.157 --> 01:15:59.500
Sorry.

01:16:01.368 --> 01:16:04.087
I know this is hard for you and Mom,

01:16:04.163 --> 01:16:08.088
but it's really hard for me too.
I feel like a ping-pong ball.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:13.009
I just wish that you guys
would get back together again.

01:16:15.341 --> 01:16:16.763
Come here.

01:16:21.305 --> 01:16:22.978
So do I, Peaches.

01:16:26.352 --> 01:16:29.322
<i>Memories</i>

01:16:30.648 --> 01:16:34.197
<i>Light the corners of my mind</i>

01:16:38.446 --> 01:16:42.076
<i>Misty watercolor
memories...</i>

01:16:47.038 --> 01:16:50.042
Phyllis! Are you upstairs?

01:16:55.171 --> 01:16:56.548
My God.

01:16:58.216 --> 01:17:01.766
<i>This</i> looks <i>like</i> a <i>scene
out of Valley of the Dolls.</i>

01:17:08.643 --> 01:17:10.566
Give me another bottle of Evian.

01:17:11.896 --> 01:17:13.193
Don't you think you've had enough?

01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:16.159
Shut up and bring me the bottle.

01:17:19.404 --> 01:17:21.281
My life is over.

01:17:24.659 --> 01:17:27.253
I brought up your mail.

01:17:27.328 --> 01:17:29.831
There's something from the family court.

01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:37.589
I want these burned

01:17:37.671 --> 01:17:41.096
and the ashes scattered over Forest Lawn.

01:17:42.134 --> 01:17:45.058
Come on. Get up. I'll make you a cappuccino,

01:17:45.137 --> 01:17:48.357
and we'll go over to Betsy's,
and we'll play some doubles.

01:17:48.932 --> 01:17:50.855
I'm not going anywhere.

01:17:50.934 --> 01:17:54.234
You cannot just lie there.

01:17:54.312 --> 01:17:56.280
Come on. We'll go to Rodolfo's.

01:17:56.857 --> 01:17:59.155
I've lost my will to shop.

01:18:01.153 --> 01:18:03.281
Phyllis, that's not funny.

01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:09.749
Velda was mean, but she was right.

01:18:09.828 --> 01:18:14.379
It's one thing to try and convince myself
that I'm a real troop leader,

01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:20.803
but to lead you girls into danger
just to save my own pride would be criminal,

01:18:21.465 --> 01:18:23.467
and I won't do it.

01:18:24.634 --> 01:18:30.357
Now I want to say
that I have loved our times together,

01:18:31.933 --> 01:18:36.062
and I will treasure them always.

01:18:36.854 --> 01:18:39.983
But it's over now.

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:44.028
Girls?

01:18:46.614 --> 01:18:49.663
Sorry, Mrs. Nefler, but a deal's a deal.

01:18:49.742 --> 01:18:51.164
You can't quit.

01:18:52.036 --> 01:18:56.086
You wouldn't let me run away,
and we won't let you either.

01:18:58.209 --> 01:19:00.587
Don't you realize what you've done for us?

01:19:02.546 --> 01:19:06.722
- You're our role model.
- And our friend.

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:09.140
Mrs. Nefler,

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:16.106
you took a group of over-indulged,
unmotivated, alienated, preadolescents

01:19:16.185 --> 01:19:18.859
and gave us renewed sense of self-esteem.

01:19:20.147 --> 01:19:24.448
I think what she means to say is
that you made us like ourselves.

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:27.952
We're a team now.
We can win any competition.

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:29.782
We can whoop the wilderness.

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:34.371
We ain't scared of nothing
as long <i>as</i> we have you.

01:19:36.163 --> 01:19:40.508
They're right, Phyl.
You've come too far to quit now.

01:19:50.135 --> 01:19:55.232
And now the main event
of the annual Wilderness Jamboree,

01:19:56.141 --> 01:19:58.314
the survival competition.

01:19:58.393 --> 01:20:03.149
Each troop must follow the path
that is designated by your color flag.

01:20:04.649 --> 01:20:07.823
Our blue flags
were for our Beverly Hills sisters,

01:20:07.902 --> 01:20:12.078
but it appears
that they've opted not to compete.

01:20:12.991 --> 01:20:17.121
Soto the rest of you, I say good luck.

01:20:17.203 --> 01:20:19.297
May the best troop win.

01:20:19.372 --> 01:20:23.002
On your marks, get set...

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:27.760
What is that noise? What is that noise?

01:20:38.223 --> 01:20:42.945
Careful, careful, easy. Yeah, here we come.

01:20:46.523 --> 01:20:50.278
Get your damn car out of my friendship ring.

01:20:51.195 --> 01:20:53.698
Hi, Vel. Lovely to see you too.

01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:56.499
Okay, fine, on your mark, get set, go.

01:21:09.004 --> 01:21:11.427
We have to hurry. We have to get
to that table with the blue banner.

01:21:11.506 --> 01:21:12.928
Put on those arm bands. Come on.

01:21:13.008 --> 01:21:15.887
The table with the blue banners, girls.
There should be a map and a compass.

01:21:15.969 --> 01:21:16.970
Hi, Velda.

01:21:18.931 --> 01:21:20.103
Just a second, Herman.

01:21:20.182 --> 01:21:23.652
Only Wilderness Girls and Troop Leaders
are allowed to participate in this.

01:21:23.727 --> 01:21:25.821
- I'm an assistant troop leader.
- Yeah.

01:21:25.896 --> 01:21:28.445
Not anymore you aren't. I just fired you.

01:21:28.523 --> 01:21:31.572
- What? Are you kidding me?
- She can't do that. That's not fair.

01:21:31.652 --> 01:21:33.575
And Nefler, you better get moving.

01:21:33.654 --> 01:21:35.452
It's 20 miles to the nearest campsite,

01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:38.453
and it's about 100 miles
to the nearest four-star hotel.

01:21:38.532 --> 01:21:40.330
Take your pick.

01:21:42.912 --> 01:21:46.507
Phyllis? I can't let you
take the girls out there alone.

01:21:46.582 --> 01:21:50.507
- Why not?
- Because you get lost in your walk-in closet.

01:21:50.586 --> 01:21:53.931
Not anymore. We've got a map here.

01:21:54.006 --> 01:21:57.556
The route is marked.
We just follow the little blue flags, right?

01:21:57.635 --> 01:21:58.602
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:21:58.678 --> 01:22:01.022
We'll be fine. We're Troop Beverly Hills.

01:22:01.097 --> 01:22:03.816
- Yeah!
- We are winners! Okay, let's go.

01:22:04.934 --> 01:22:07.938
Remember, the troop that gets back here
in the shortest time wins.

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.114
You'll be timed from here
to the midpoint tonight.

01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:13.910
Bivouac there, and then tomorrow
you race into the finish line. Got it?

01:22:13.985 --> 01:22:15.578
Sure, sure, I got it.

01:22:15.653 --> 01:22:18.623
Do you know how to use a compass?

01:22:18.698 --> 01:22:21.952
- I can learn.
- Don't worry, Mom. I can do it.

01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:25.333
- Is that a snake?
- No, it's not.

01:22:25.413 --> 01:22:30.294
- Emily, is that poison oak?
- Gross, yuck.

01:22:30.376 --> 01:22:34.882
Okay, now, north is that way.
Which way is the campsite?

01:22:37.091 --> 01:22:38.684
I can do this.

01:22:39.384 --> 01:22:43.605
Gucci's just north of Wilshire.
The Beverly Wilshire Hotel is west.

01:22:44.556 --> 01:22:47.730
I think the campsite is at Cartier, so to speak.

01:22:47.809 --> 01:22:49.937
You guys, there's the blue flag.

01:23:05.076 --> 01:23:07.420
Backhand's a little rusty.

01:23:17.881 --> 01:23:19.679
All right, another blue flag.

01:23:28.892 --> 01:23:32.522
Annie, something's kind of fishy here.

01:23:32.604 --> 01:23:33.981
Where are you?

01:23:34.064 --> 01:23:38.365
We're standing in a jungle of reeds
with goo up to our ankles.

01:23:38.443 --> 01:23:40.740
<i>It sounds like Dead Man's Swamp.</i>

01:23:40.819 --> 01:23:41.945
Good.

01:23:45.157 --> 01:23:51.790
Annie, do rattlesnakes live in swamps?

01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:54.633
No, they hate water.

01:23:56.126 --> 01:23:58.379
Thank God. Thanks, Annie.

01:23:58.462 --> 01:24:01.011
<i>Water moccasins live in swamps.</i>

01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:04.685
<i>They're just as deadly, but
they don't make any noise before they strike.</i>

01:24:09.014 --> 01:24:11.312
Philly? Phyllis?

01:24:11.975 --> 01:24:15.570
<i>Are you there? Phyllis? Phyllis?</i>

01:24:18.857 --> 01:24:21.986
What an adventure.
Isn't nature fabulous, girls?

01:24:29.493 --> 01:24:31.587
I'm very proud of you girls. Terrific.

01:24:31.662 --> 01:24:33.414
Good spirit, Tiffany.

01:24:35.082 --> 01:24:36.880
Good spirit, girls.

01:24:37.668 --> 01:24:41.638
A few positive words from me,
and they get their second wind.

01:24:46.634 --> 01:24:48.682
Six hours, 27 minutes.

01:24:49.053 --> 01:24:53.024
Anytime now, those Red Feathers
will be coming up right over that horizon.

01:24:53.099 --> 01:24:57.525
Setting the new record time
for the first half of this competition.

01:24:57.979 --> 01:25:01.028
We're number one. We're number one.

01:25:01.107 --> 01:25:03.109
There they are.

01:25:03.192 --> 01:25:06.071
We're number one. We're number one.

01:25:15.371 --> 01:25:18.170
No. No.

01:25:20.042 --> 01:25:21.840
Halt. Nefler.

01:25:33.473 --> 01:25:36.898
You're gonna pay for this. Yes, you are.

01:25:47.903 --> 01:25:53.376
Redondo Beach, seven hours 21 minutes.
Pomona, seven hours and four minutes.

01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:57.000
Red Feathers, six hours 29 minutes.

01:25:57.078 --> 01:26:00.127
Beverly Hills,
six hours, 28 and a half minutes.

01:26:00.207 --> 01:26:02.505
Do you hear that?
I thought you said we were gonna win?

01:26:02.584 --> 01:26:05.929
You are. Just leave it to me.

01:26:06.004 --> 01:26:08.427
- Grundman?
- Yes, sir... Ma'am.

01:26:08.507 --> 01:26:11.932
I'm gonna be taking over tomorrow.
You're going to be too sick to continue.

01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:13.603
I am?

01:26:19.017 --> 01:26:21.736
There's been a slight change of plans.

01:26:21.811 --> 01:26:24.234
Mrs. Grundman is gravely ill.

01:26:24.773 --> 01:26:28.198
I have no other option
but to lead the Red Feathers myself.

01:26:28.276 --> 01:26:30.574
What? That's not fair.

01:26:30.654 --> 01:26:32.873
That's not fair. She mapped out the course.

01:26:32.948 --> 01:26:36.794
The second leg of the competition
will begin on my command.

01:26:36.868 --> 01:26:39.371
Ready, set, go.

01:26:41.122 --> 01:26:46.503
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:26:50.631 --> 01:26:54.431
Because that buffalo butt is breaking
every rule by joining those little monsters

01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:56.888
doesn't mean we can't be good sports, right?

01:26:56.971 --> 01:26:57.972
Right!

01:26:58.055 --> 01:27:01.275
- Yeah, we played by the rules, right?
- Right!

01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:03.603
And we're gonna win, right?

01:27:03.686 --> 01:27:06.064
- Right!
- Right.

01:27:06.146 --> 01:27:07.819
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:27:07.898 --> 01:27:09.900
<i>We're the girls from Beverly Hills</i>

01:27:09.984 --> 01:27:11.657
One, two, three, four.

01:27:11.735 --> 01:27:13.612
<i>Shopping is our greatest skill</i>

01:27:13.696 --> 01:27:15.539
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:27:15.614 --> 01:27:17.491
<i>We will fight and try real hard</i>

01:27:17.575 --> 01:27:19.248
One, two, three, four.

01:27:19.326 --> 01:27:21.249
<i>Leave behind our credit card</i>

01:27:21.328 --> 01:27:23.046
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:27:23.122 --> 01:27:26.752
<i>Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill</i>

01:27:26.834 --> 01:27:30.259
<i>Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill</i>

01:27:30.337 --> 01:27:34.058
<i>Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill</i>

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:51.987
No.

01:27:54.444 --> 01:27:58.574
Well, au revoir, mon Jamboree.

01:28:00.742 --> 01:28:06.124
Well, hey, you know, we got into the woods,
and we had a nice time.

01:28:06.205 --> 01:28:08.003
That's a crock of shit.

01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:10.961
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

01:28:11.044 --> 01:28:15.094
Just once, I would like to go the distance.

01:28:16.341 --> 01:28:17.388
Mom.

01:28:20.678 --> 01:28:24.933
It really frosts my cookies
that we have worked so hard,

01:28:25.016 --> 01:28:29.317
and we have come so far,
and now we have to stop.

01:28:29.395 --> 01:28:32.399
Not necessarily. Look.

01:28:38.488 --> 01:28:42.618
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No.
No, I can't let you do this.

01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:44.873
I can do it, Morn.
It's just like the balance beam.

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:49.172
This is no balance beam, honey.
This isn't even a bridge. This is a log.

01:28:49.247 --> 01:28:53.252
It's very treacherous,
and that is a very, very deep ravine.

01:28:53.919 --> 01:28:56.138
Only an idiot would walk across that.

01:28:56.213 --> 01:28:57.590
I'm going to do it.

01:28:57.673 --> 01:28:59.346
Mom, you're afraid of heights.

01:28:59.424 --> 01:29:03.429
You fell off the garden wall
when you were spying on Dad.

01:29:03.512 --> 01:29:07.608
I wasn't spying on Dad.
I was checking on my azaleas.

01:29:08.141 --> 01:29:10.860
I was spying on Dad.
But that's not really the point here.

01:29:10.936 --> 01:29:14.861
The point is that I'm the adult.
I'm the responsible one.

01:29:15.774 --> 01:29:19.028
And for a change, I'm gonna take care of you.

01:29:19.986 --> 01:29:22.535
You always have.

01:29:22.614 --> 01:29:25.037
- I have?
- Yeah.

01:29:25.951 --> 01:29:28.045
Me and seven other girls.

01:29:29.705 --> 01:29:32.299
Yeah, you're a lucky kid.

01:29:33.709 --> 01:29:36.337
- Be careful.
- Okay.

01:29:46.512 --> 01:29:48.230
If I get across...

01:29:48.305 --> 01:29:53.232
When, when I get across,
I want you to go down to the bridge,

01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:57.656
tie a rock on the loose end,
and throw it across to me.

01:29:58.399 --> 01:29:59.992
- Okay?
"Okay

01:30:08.284 --> 01:30:13.211
lam the log. lam the ravine.

01:30:14.165 --> 01:30:16.042
I am scared.

01:30:36.771 --> 01:30:38.569
- This isn't so bad.
- Mom!

01:30:48.198 --> 01:30:49.199
Morn!

01:30:50.784 --> 01:30:53.503
- Be careful, Hannah.
- I'm coming, Mom.

01:30:53.578 --> 01:30:55.831
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

01:30:56.873 --> 01:30:58.546
- Concentrate.
- Go slower.

01:30:58.625 --> 01:31:00.719
- Hannah, go back.
- No.

01:31:00.794 --> 01:31:04.219
- I'm not gonna let you stay out here.
- Hannah!

01:31:04.297 --> 01:31:08.768
- Mom, my foot's stuck.
- Good.

01:31:08.843 --> 01:31:09.935
God.

01:31:10.553 --> 01:31:13.932
Okay. Here I come.

01:31:15.266 --> 01:31:17.894
- Stay right there.
- Hannah, try.

01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:20.651
I'm coming.

01:31:21.689 --> 01:31:24.488
- Does it hurt?
- No.

01:31:24.567 --> 01:31:26.820
Okay, let's push.

01:31:29.239 --> 01:31:32.413
Push hard. Don't lose your balance.

01:31:32.492 --> 01:31:34.586
Okay, put your foot down.

01:31:35.453 --> 01:31:37.581
Okay, I'm gonna turn around.
ls your foot all right?

01:31:37.664 --> 01:31:39.541
- Yeah, it's okay.
- Okay, okay.

01:31:39.624 --> 01:31:43.254
Don't look down. Here we go.

01:31:44.504 --> 01:31:46.552
Take my hand, honey.

01:31:49.466 --> 01:31:53.221
I distinctly remember telling you
to stay off this log.

01:31:53.303 --> 01:31:55.146
Of course what do I know?
I'm just your mother.

01:31:55.222 --> 01:31:59.272
- I'm sorry.
- Sure, easy to say that now, you're sorry.

01:31:59.351 --> 01:32:02.275
But will you listen the next time?
I'd just like someone to listen.

01:32:02.354 --> 01:32:05.278
Sometimes you're as stubborn as your father.

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:09.370
We did it! We did it! Honey.

01:32:10.404 --> 01:32:11.872
Mom, you're a hero.

01:32:11.947 --> 01:32:14.075
Wait, stop. It was nothing. It wasn't that bad.

01:32:14.157 --> 01:32:17.457
It was awful. It was awful, but we made it.

01:32:18.871 --> 01:32:22.091
Okay, go down to the bridge.
Go down to the bridge.

01:32:23.375 --> 01:32:28.506
Damn. Those little bimbesses
are really starting to bug me.

01:32:29.631 --> 01:32:33.431
All right, screw the flags, girls.
I know a shortcut.

01:32:34.636 --> 01:32:37.389
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:32:39.975 --> 01:32:41.477
I don't know, Ms. Plendor.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:44.530
The map says
this areas is for hunters and trappers only.

01:32:44.605 --> 01:32:46.232
It might be dangerous.

01:32:46.315 --> 01:32:49.693
It is only dangerous
when you don't know what you're doing.

01:32:51.903 --> 01:32:53.405
Ankle!

01:32:54.113 --> 01:32:56.115
This is unbelievable.

01:32:56.198 --> 01:32:57.666
We haven't lost that much time.

01:32:57.742 --> 01:33:00.086
- Really?
- Let me see the map.

01:33:00.161 --> 01:33:01.708
Wouldn't it be bizarre if we won?

01:33:01.787 --> 01:33:04.666
- Hey, we already won.
- What do you mean?

01:33:05.499 --> 01:33:08.628
Well, we didn't quit, and we didn't cheat.

01:33:08.711 --> 01:33:11.089
And we didn't call home
when we were in trouble.

01:33:11.172 --> 01:33:14.802
- We were a team. We won.
- We did.

01:33:14.884 --> 01:33:16.181
- You're right.
- Yeah.

01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:18.638
Now let's beat those suckers
at their own game.

01:33:18.721 --> 01:33:19.893
Yeah, let's go.

01:33:21.265 --> 01:33:22.357
Hey!

01:33:24.644 --> 01:33:28.990
It's broken.
Jamie, some rations and some water.

01:33:30.107 --> 01:33:33.156
Come on, you're not gonna leave me here.

01:33:33.235 --> 01:33:34.282
You're dead weight.

01:33:34.362 --> 01:33:37.866
Besides, after we win,
we'll send someone back to get to you.

01:33:37.949 --> 01:33:39.417
Come on, Red Feathers, move on.

01:33:39.492 --> 01:33:44.464
Cleo, I was in labor with you for 17 hours!

01:33:44.914 --> 01:33:47.292
I bought you your first...

01:33:47.375 --> 01:33:51.629
I have patches, girls!
I can get you into West Point.

01:33:52.379 --> 01:33:54.507
You little bitches!

01:33:56.132 --> 01:33:58.351
Oh, my God, what was that?

01:33:58.426 --> 01:34:00.929
Don't worry.
It was probably just one of nature's beasts.

01:34:01.012 --> 01:34:07.110
Geek brain! I hate children! I hate them!

01:34:08.061 --> 01:34:10.940
Yep, it's a beast, all right.

01:34:12.732 --> 01:34:14.109
Move out.

01:34:17.529 --> 01:34:19.031
Hey.

01:34:19.864 --> 01:34:21.832
How bad is it, Tessa?

01:34:21.908 --> 01:34:28.336
Well, there's multiple contusions
and possibly a cracked fibula.

01:34:29.082 --> 01:34:31.380
And a severe personality disorder.

01:34:35.422 --> 01:34:36.969
There's a nurse at the finish line.

01:34:37.048 --> 01:34:39.892
What's the quickest way
we can get you there?

01:34:39.968 --> 01:34:42.847
No. You don't want to help me.

01:34:42.929 --> 01:34:47.275
You just want to know the quickest way
to get there so you can win.

01:34:48.184 --> 01:34:50.937
Well, blow it out your barracks bag,
sweetheart.

01:34:51.021 --> 01:34:54.274
You can leave me behind,
because I'm not talking.

01:34:54.356 --> 01:34:55.733
Well, let's leave her.

01:34:55.816 --> 01:34:57.944
We've already lost
a lot of time because of her.

01:34:58.027 --> 01:35:00.029
Besides, she hates us.

01:35:00.112 --> 01:35:02.410
Why should we lose just to help her?

01:35:03.157 --> 01:35:06.206
Well, it's a real moral dilemma, isn't it, girls?

01:35:06.285 --> 01:35:09.755
We could help a fellow Wilderness Girl,

01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:13.380
as we swore we would
when we pledged the Wilderness Promise.

01:35:13.459 --> 01:35:14.881
That's right.

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.966
Or we could leave her here
and pursue our own personal glory.

01:35:20.966 --> 01:35:23.936
While she is ravaged by vicious beasts,

01:35:25.429 --> 01:35:28.979
toyed with by lonely mountain men.

01:35:31.477 --> 01:35:33.024
Really lonely mountain men.

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:37.107
I leave it up to you.

01:35:37.858 --> 01:35:39.280
Huddle.

01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:46.791
I think we should leave her. She's just a pain.

01:35:46.867 --> 01:35:48.414
Go tell her.

01:35:48.494 --> 01:35:52.044
Ms. Nefler, she's history. We're out of here.

01:35:52.997 --> 01:35:54.465
Come on.

01:35:57.085 --> 01:36:00.339
Come on, guys. We did swear.

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:20.533
I knew I could count on you girls
to do the right thing.

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.861
Stop, or I'll bust out crying.

01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:25.948
I knew I could count on you losers
to do the wimpy thing.

01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:27.907
You need your rest.

01:36:28.866 --> 01:36:30.493
As the girls are clearing the woods,

01:36:30.576 --> 01:36:33.329
I want a tight close-up on Tessa.
Stay with her.

01:36:33.412 --> 01:36:35.540
Then we're gonna whip pan
through the rest of the woods.

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:38.422
Now the theme of the shot is victory.

01:36:41.379 --> 01:36:42.551
I think I see somebody.

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:47.477
We're number one. We're number one.
We're number one. We're number one.

01:36:47.552 --> 01:36:51.273
-It's the Red Feathers.
- Oh, dear.

01:37:00.188 --> 01:37:05.615
Hearty congratulations to the winners
of our annual Wilderness Jamboree,

01:37:05.694 --> 01:37:08.743
the Culver City Red Feathers.

01:37:12.492 --> 01:37:14.085
Thank you, Mrs. Temple.

01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:17.791
On behalf of the other Feathers and myself,
we felt good.

01:37:17.873 --> 01:37:20.092
We were pumped.
We came to win, and we won.

01:37:22.836 --> 01:37:26.841
I'd like to say that the other three troops
gave us a real run for our money,

01:37:26.923 --> 01:37:29.017
but they didn't.

01:37:29.092 --> 01:37:31.845
Wait a minute, dear. Wait.
Where's your mother?

01:37:31.928 --> 01:37:34.226
I don't know. Give me the trophy.

01:37:34.306 --> 01:37:37.401
Dear, the rules specifically state

01:37:37.475 --> 01:37:42.106
that the trophy goes to the first entire troop
to cross the finish line.

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:43.736
No leader, no trophy.

01:37:43.815 --> 01:37:45.442
Give me the trophy.

01:37:45.525 --> 01:37:47.653
Get your footing, girls,
going down the hill please.

01:37:47.736 --> 01:37:48.862
Look.

01:37:49.446 --> 01:37:50.493
Come on, Jamie.

01:37:55.242 --> 01:37:58.291
Look, they're dragging something.

01:37:59.330 --> 01:38:01.048
Looks like an animal.

01:38:01.874 --> 01:38:03.421
Must be Velda.

01:38:26.941 --> 01:38:28.113
<i>That's a cut.</i>

01:38:29.151 --> 01:38:34.874
The Red Feathers came in without a leader,
therefore, they are disqualified.

01:38:35.658 --> 01:38:39.754
And the winners are Troop Beverly Hills.

01:38:44.333 --> 01:38:45.505
No!

01:38:46.126 --> 01:38:47.878
We did it! We did it!

01:38:48.671 --> 01:38:52.266
No, no, no, no, no way!

01:38:52.341 --> 01:38:55.344
You're not even Wilderness Girls.
None of you are.

01:38:55.426 --> 01:38:57.679
I'm the only real Wilderness Girl.

01:38:58.471 --> 01:39:01.520
Does she strike you
as being minus a few buttons?

01:39:02.183 --> 01:39:06.188
I'll tell you about the buttons,
you senile old bag.

01:39:06.771 --> 01:39:09.775
I may be old, and I may be senile,

01:39:09.857 --> 01:39:13.703
but the only thing
that's bagged around here is you.

01:39:13.778 --> 01:39:15.451
You're fired.

01:39:16.364 --> 01:39:20.665
Fine. I really care. So what? Who cares?

01:39:20.743 --> 01:39:23.121
I don't need you. I don't need anybody.

01:39:23.204 --> 01:39:25.673
I'm gonna secede
from the national organization.

01:39:25.748 --> 01:39:27.341
Yeah, that's it. I'll secede,

01:39:27.417 --> 01:39:31.138
and I'll form my own organization,
yeah, Plendor's Pilgrims.

01:39:31.212 --> 01:39:32.805
That's it, Plendor's Pilgrims.

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:35.633
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Plendor's Pioneers.

01:39:35.717 --> 01:39:37.185
How's that? That's perfect.

01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:40.560
What about Velda's Avengers?

01:39:40.930 --> 01:39:43.479
I'm sorry to see you go.

01:39:43.558 --> 01:39:46.311
She was always fun at our Halloween party.

01:39:48.062 --> 01:39:51.032
And I'm sorry we don't have a trophy for you.

01:39:51.899 --> 01:39:54.994
Well, we don't need a trophy, huh?

01:39:55.069 --> 01:39:59.448
Yeah, I mean, all we wanted to do
was to prove we were real Wilderness Girls.

01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:02.914
Well, who ever said you weren't?

01:40:03.327 --> 01:40:04.579
Velda.

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:28.443
I wish Dad were here.

01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:32.899
I know. Me too.

01:40:40.697 --> 01:40:45.999
You did it. I am so proud of you.
I knew you could do it. You were great.

01:40:46.078 --> 01:40:47.580
Mom did it.

01:40:54.419 --> 01:40:56.137
May I kiss the Troop Leader?

01:40:59.090 --> 01:41:00.592
It's okay with me.

01:41:13.854 --> 01:41:15.652
I'm sorry, Phyl.

01:41:16.649 --> 01:41:19.653
- I love you, Wilderness Girl.
- Fred.

01:41:22.446 --> 01:41:25.666
I love you, Muffler Man.

01:41:26.951 --> 01:41:29.329
It's about time you two grew up.

01:41:34.542 --> 01:41:37.170
- Well, we should get married.
- Again.

01:41:39.004 --> 01:41:41.132
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:41:41.215 --> 01:41:43.309
<i>We're the girls from Beverly Hills</i>

01:41:43.384 --> 01:41:44.977
One, two, three, four.

01:41:45.052 --> 01:41:47.521
<i>Shopping was our greatest skill</i>

01:41:47.596 --> 01:41:49.439
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:41:49.515 --> 01:41:51.734
<i>After all is said and done</i>

01:41:51.809 --> 01:41:53.777
One, two, three, four.

01:41:53.853 --> 01:41:55.947
<i>Beverly Hills is number one</i>

01:41:56.021 --> 01:41:57.898
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:41:57.982 --> 01:42:01.827
<i>Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill</i>

01:42:01.901 --> 01:42:06.156
<i>Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill</i>

01:42:06.239 --> 01:42:08.617
<i>Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill</i>

01:42:22.255 --> 01:42:28.183
