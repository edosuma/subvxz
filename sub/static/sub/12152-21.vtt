00:02.493 --> 00:05.291
GUNN: You're a Power that was?
ANGEL: We've all been saved.

00:05.453 --> 00:08.206
JASMINE:
<i>For so long you've all been drowning.</i>

00:08.613 --> 00:11.446
The fighting and the pain.
I'd like to help.

00:11.613 --> 00:14.605
I scrubbed the other one till my
fingers bled, but I couldn't get out the...

00:15.093 --> 00:16.811
JASMINE: Fred?
...blood.

00:17.053 --> 00:21.444
Jasmine's blood. Somehow it breaks
her spell when it mingles with ours.

00:21.613 --> 00:26.164
ANGEL: We hoped Cordy's blood
would have the same effect.

00:28.413 --> 00:30.165
You're back with us now, Connor.

00:30.373 --> 00:32.409
They're here!
Come quick, they're here!

00:32.613 --> 00:34.444
ANGEL: Drive.
CONNOR: <i>I'll bring them down.</i>

00:34.613 --> 00:36.922
This world is about to kneel
before me.

00:37.093 --> 00:39.971
FRED: I doubt anyone knows
these tunnels better than you.

00:40.133 --> 00:41.407
ANGEL:
Where's Wes?

00:41.573 --> 00:44.406
- We loved her first.
- Jasmine?

00:44.573 --> 00:46.768
Soon you'll go out with all
of my strength behind you.

00:46.933 --> 00:48.525
She has a name and it has power
over her.

00:48.693 --> 00:50.365
That's why she keeps it a secret.

00:50.693 --> 00:54.163
That creature, he came from a world
that's worshipped Jasmine for millennia.

00:54.333 --> 00:56.563
- We reach it through this.
FRED: Connor, he's here.

00:56.733 --> 00:58.007
ANGEL: I know.
WESLEY: I've got it.

00:58.173 --> 00:59.845
Someone who knows the truth
has to live through this.

01:00.013 --> 01:01.332
Angel, that's you.

01:03.413 --> 01:04.926

Peace Out

CONNOR:
What did you think you could do?

03:27.373 --> 03:30.206
Poison the whole city with your hate?

03:32.573 --> 03:34.723
Your tricks?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.601
- Now I have no choice but to kill you.
- Connor...

03:39.253 --> 03:40.845
Shut up.

03:41.893 --> 03:44.612
All your talk about
saving the world.

03:45.173 --> 03:49.212
Well, now somebody's gone
and done it.

03:49.493 --> 03:51.404
Made everything right...

03:52.013 --> 03:53.844
...and good.

03:54.333 --> 03:57.723
And you can't stand it because
you're all so full of yourselves.

04:04.933 --> 04:07.288
Don't you get it?

04:07.893 --> 04:10.282
You're all alone now.

04:11.653 --> 04:13.609
All of you.

04:13.773 --> 04:16.333
You're the ones left
out in the cold.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.531
You...

04:18.692 --> 04:20.125
...don't...

04:20.293 --> 04:21.692
...belong.

04:21.853 --> 04:24.925
If belonging means following some
bogus god, killing in her name...

04:25.093 --> 04:27.561
...we don't.
- I'm not listening to your lies.

04:27.813 --> 04:30.691
Jasmine's the lie.
You've no idea what she is.

04:30.853 --> 04:32.650
Yes, I do.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.245
She's mine.

04:36.813 --> 04:38.690
SPEAKING IN JASMINE'S VOICE:
Connor, wait.

04:39.853 --> 04:42.651
- Bring them to me.
- Why?

04:43.373 --> 04:45.762
Has it become necessary to
explain my wishes to you?

04:46.133 --> 04:49.284
- No, it's just...
- Then be a sweet boy and bring them...

04:49.733 --> 04:51.007
...intact.

04:58.773 --> 05:00.172
Thank you, Connor.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.290
JASMINE:
<i>There's a long road before us...</i>

05:29.893 --> 05:33.932
...and there's still much to do,
but we've made a wonderful start.

05:34.173 --> 05:35.606
MAN: Yes.
- Thanks to all of you.

05:35.773 --> 05:39.288
Your devotion and sacrifice
have made a difference.

05:39.453 --> 05:40.727
GROUP:
Thank you.

05:40.893 --> 05:43.965
Now, if you'll join the others
in the banquet room...

05:44.133 --> 05:46.806
...I'll be with you shortly.
GROUP: Thank you so much.

05:51.693 --> 05:55.288
So much pain, suffering.

05:55.453 --> 05:57.728
- It must hurt so terribly.
- Don't get all gloat-y.

05:57.893 --> 05:59.645
Not the worst beating
we've ever taken.

05:59.813 --> 06:03.567
I meant the pain you've caused
yourselves, letting go of me.

06:03.733 --> 06:07.487
Oh, by giving up absolute
tranquillity and perfect happiness?

06:07.653 --> 06:09.609
No loss. Right, guys?

06:10.973 --> 06:12.326
Guys?

06:13.333 --> 06:16.370
I only wish it was within
my power to take you back.

06:16.693 --> 06:18.285
Nobody asked.

06:20.053 --> 06:21.884
- Where's Angel?
WESLEY: You're omniscient.

06:22.053 --> 06:23.771
You tell us.

06:25.013 --> 06:28.164
Connor, please.
I don't want to see that.

06:31.173 --> 06:33.562
WESLEY:
The creature in the sewer...

06:34.493 --> 06:37.007
...you recognized it, didn't you?
- Yes.

06:37.173 --> 06:39.164
Just another one of your zealots.

06:39.933 --> 06:44.245
A sentient, living being wanting
what's best for his own.

06:44.493 --> 06:49.613
Is that so wrong? A few millennia ago,
his world was not unlike yours.

06:49.773 --> 06:53.527
Full of hatred and fear,
wars scarring its landscape.

06:53.693 --> 06:57.163
Until, let me guess, you came
along and made it a paradise.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.803
Well, as much of a paradise
as one could...

07:00.973 --> 07:03.203
...with a bunch
of insects to work with.

07:03.373 --> 07:07.082
I helped them along,
kicked their evolution up a few ticks.

07:07.253 --> 07:08.811
And how'd that work out for them?

07:10.333 --> 07:12.289
It was a trial run...

07:12.453 --> 07:16.366
...an early experiment to work
out the bugs, so to speak.

07:17.693 --> 07:19.843
I won't make that mistake again.

07:20.293 --> 07:23.046
I know where Angel is, and I
know what he's looking for.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.245
He's wasting his time.

07:25.733 --> 07:29.567
If you really believed that,
you'd have killed us already.

07:32.133 --> 07:33.407
Patience.

07:36.733 --> 07:38.007
Yes, ma'am?

07:38.173 --> 07:39.925
JASMINE:
The news people have arrived.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.129
Please ask them to set up
in the lobby.

07:42.293 --> 07:44.204
I'll speak with them
after I've eaten.

07:44.413 --> 07:45.892
Mm-hm.

07:46.093 --> 07:47.731
So it's time, is it?

07:48.613 --> 07:50.205
Time for what?

07:50.933 --> 07:54.642
Too much trouble conquering a
primitive dimension, wasn't it, Jasmine?

07:55.013 --> 07:56.605
Or whatever your name is.

07:56.773 --> 07:58.923
Must be nice for you
that we have satellites...

07:59.093 --> 08:01.323
...to beam your message
to the rest of the world.

08:01.493 --> 08:02.767
You're not wrong.

08:02.933 --> 08:06.721
Oh, God. Connor, you can't let her
do this. She'll enslave everyone.

08:06.893 --> 08:09.361
- She'll bring them together.
- You don't...

08:09.533 --> 08:11.444
She's not what she pretends to be.
She's...

08:11.613 --> 08:13.171
- A monster.
FRED: Yeah.

08:15.493 --> 08:17.085
Cordy's blood that we put in you...

08:17.253 --> 08:20.325
...was supposed to break the spell,
show you what she looks like.

08:20.693 --> 08:22.843
I know what she looks like.

08:25.693 --> 08:27.012
She's beautiful.

08:27.493 --> 08:32.123
Gentlemen, please show our
guests to their accommodations.

08:32.293 --> 08:33.611
Save us the euphemisms.

08:33.773 --> 08:36.366
We're bargaining chips
to keep Angel quiet.

08:36.533 --> 08:39.251
- Quiet about what?
- Connor...

08:39.413 --> 08:42.371
...this address is going to be
very draining for me.

08:42.533 --> 08:44.444
While I'm feasting
to build my strength...

08:44.613 --> 08:46.524
...I'm going to be
out of touch with you...

08:46.973 --> 08:50.329
...with everything. You'll be my
eyes and ears, you understand?

08:50.493 --> 08:51.767
Yeah.

08:51.933 --> 08:55.164
I want you to stand guard over them,
make sure they don't escape.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.563
If Angel so much as shows his face...

08:57.733 --> 09:00.293
What is he looking for? Angel?

09:02.613 --> 09:04.365
The unattainable.

09:28.813 --> 09:32.283
HIGH PRIEST: A long way to come,
dead thing, only to fail.

09:32.453 --> 09:36.048
Don't worry. The way down
will be much, much quicker.

09:36.213 --> 09:39.364
Thanks for the tip. Maybe I can use
your body to cushion the blow.

09:39.533 --> 09:42.286
HIGH PRIEST: I doubt my form
would provide you much protection.

09:42.533 --> 09:45.366
But you're welcome to try.

09:48.613 --> 09:49.966
You? You're...? You're the...?

09:50.133 --> 09:53.808
High Priest.
Guardian of the Word.

09:54.253 --> 09:57.962
Caretaker of Her Most Blessed Temple.

09:58.573 --> 10:01.087
ANGEL: Well, Blessed Temple's
kind of empty, Padre.

10:01.533 --> 10:05.082
So where are the other true believers?
Or are you it?

10:05.293 --> 10:08.649
Ha! Betrayers. Blasphemers.

10:08.813 --> 10:12.647
Centuries of waiting for a return
have caused most to doubt.

10:12.853 --> 10:15.242
But not you, her faithful P.R. Flak.

10:15.893 --> 10:17.884
She is the light.

10:18.053 --> 10:21.011
- She is the way.
- She is not coming back.

10:21.613 --> 10:25.003
She will, when she's through
with your world.

10:25.933 --> 10:29.323
You know, maybe we're not talking
about the same person here.

10:29.493 --> 10:31.245
What's the name of yours again?

10:31.933 --> 10:35.403
That's why you're here, dead thing,
what you've come for.

10:35.573 --> 10:38.087
The Word. The Name.

10:38.253 --> 10:39.572
Good.

10:39.933 --> 10:42.527
You got that.
So I don't have to ask it again.

10:43.093 --> 10:44.367
What is it?

10:44.533 --> 10:50.085
Fool. You can take away her power,
but you've already lost everything.

10:54.493 --> 10:56.324
I've just gotta know one thing.

10:56.493 --> 10:59.929
The reason our little blood ritual
didn't raise any veils for you.

11:00.373 --> 11:03.570
You've always seen Jasmine's
true appearance, haven't you?

11:05.293 --> 11:06.931
You gotta be kidding me.

11:07.093 --> 11:11.006
You know what maggot-face looks like,
and you're still big with the worship?

11:11.453 --> 11:13.489
I grew up in Quor-toth.

11:13.973 --> 11:18.251
A hell dimension, full of all sorts
of things you can't even imagine.

11:18.653 --> 11:20.769
So, you know, appearance...

11:20.933 --> 11:23.970
...not that important to me.
- What is important to you, Connor?

11:24.133 --> 11:26.408
Not us, apparently, or his own father.

11:26.893 --> 11:28.451
FRED:
What about Cordelia?

11:30.613 --> 11:32.808
She needs help, medical attention.

11:32.973 --> 11:35.248
I mean, who knows what
that coma's doing to her?

11:35.413 --> 11:38.530
- She's fine.
- Are you sure? Have you checked on her?

11:38.693 --> 11:40.126
If you don't care for her...

11:40.293 --> 11:41.931
She isn't...

11:43.013 --> 11:44.366
She's been moved.

11:44.533 --> 11:46.171
Moved? What do you mean?

11:46.333 --> 11:49.166
Someplace safe, okay?
She's taken care of, so just quit...

11:49.333 --> 11:52.166
- Connor, what does Jasmine eat?
- What?

11:53.733 --> 11:57.931
The creature in the sewer,
it called her the Devourer.

11:58.293 --> 11:59.567
Devourer of what?

12:00.493 --> 12:02.245
- I don't know.
- Don't you?

12:03.253 --> 12:07.610
The followers she randomly chooses
to come to her room.

12:07.773 --> 12:10.651
The ones she sent to meet
her in the banquet hall.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.087
They're the banquet.

12:12.253 --> 12:15.165
Wait. People? She eats people?

12:15.333 --> 12:16.607
FRED:
Oh, no.

12:16.773 --> 12:19.333
"To Serve Man."
It's "To Serve Man" all over again.

12:19.493 --> 12:21.051
And now she's going global.

12:21.213 --> 12:22.771
- You don't think Cordy's...?
WESLEY: I hope not.

12:22.933 --> 12:25.208
But we really have no way
of knowing, do we?

12:29.493 --> 12:31.085
HIGH PRIEST:
I know all about you.

12:31.253 --> 12:34.370
She who brought us up from the mud
and molded us into what we are...

12:34.533 --> 12:37.206
...has given me sight into the hearts
and minds of others.

12:37.373 --> 12:39.091
I see you. I know all about...

12:39.253 --> 12:41.767
Then you know I'm kind of in a hurry.
Give me her name.

12:42.493 --> 12:44.961
- Keeper!
- That's it?

12:46.173 --> 12:47.447
Caper?

12:47.853 --> 12:52.369
Her true name is known only
by the Keeper of the Name.

12:52.533 --> 12:54.524
Right. That's you.

12:54.693 --> 12:56.729
No! I am the Guardian of the Word.

12:56.893 --> 13:00.044
- You said the word is the name.
- Yes, and I guard the Keeper of it.

13:00.213 --> 13:03.523
- So you are the Keeper's keeper?
- I am the Guardian of the Word.

13:03.693 --> 13:06.491
Yeah, yeah, okay. So where's
this Keeper of the Name?

13:15.293 --> 13:16.567
Swell.

13:16.733 --> 13:19.042
The Keeper will not be forthcoming.

13:19.213 --> 13:25.049
Only with its last breath will it divulge
the true name of the Blessed Devourer.

13:25.613 --> 13:28.923
Okay, big guy,
you got a name I need.

13:29.133 --> 13:32.205
So we can either do this the easy
way or the hard way.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.444
But you're gonna give me
her name, or...

13:34.653 --> 13:37.213
[GROWLS]

13:37.853 --> 13:40.083
Right. The hard way.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.290
JASMINE:
I'm so glad you're here.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.967
WOMAN:
Thank you. Thank you so much.

13:51.133 --> 13:55.923
Before you came, my life was a mess.
I had no job. I was being evicted.

13:56.093 --> 13:57.367
It's all right, Susan.

13:57.533 --> 13:59.888
You'll never be burdened
with those worries again.

14:00.093 --> 14:04.211
WOMAN: The emptiness, the weight I've
been carrying all my life, it's gone.

14:04.373 --> 14:07.012
- All that I feel now is...
- Connor. Is everything...?

14:07.173 --> 14:08.970
I need to talk to you.

14:09.133 --> 14:12.125
- Excuse us a moment.
WOMAN: Of course, Jasmine.

14:16.453 --> 14:20.287
Can we do this later? I really hate
to keep these lovely people waiting.

14:20.613 --> 14:22.046
I'm sorry.

14:22.853 --> 14:26.892
I was... I was just wondering.
I...

14:27.373 --> 14:29.284
I wanted to know...

14:29.613 --> 14:31.092
Cordelia.

14:32.573 --> 14:33.847
Yeah.

14:34.013 --> 14:36.288
What did you do with her, exactly?

14:36.453 --> 14:38.887
I told you. She's exactly where
I need her to be.

14:39.053 --> 14:40.327
Out of harm's way.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.163
Yeah. I think I should know.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.403
But there's no reason for you
to know.

14:45.573 --> 14:48.133
Just take comfort in my words.

14:48.293 --> 14:50.523
She's safe and...

14:53.213 --> 14:55.408
- You think I ate her.
- What?

14:56.053 --> 14:57.611
No. No.

14:58.373 --> 15:00.807
It's all right, Connor. I'm not offended.

15:01.613 --> 15:04.605
But who would put such
a ridiculous idea in your head?

15:04.773 --> 15:07.606
No one. I never thought...

15:09.373 --> 15:11.364
So, no then, about the eating?

15:11.533 --> 15:16.049
I could never hurt Cordelia Chase
any more than I could you.

15:16.213 --> 15:19.728
You're my parents,
my tether to this world.

15:20.373 --> 15:23.445
It was your love
that brought me here.

15:23.893 --> 15:26.691
I understand. You miss her.

15:26.853 --> 15:30.892
So she's still here?
She's not in some alternate dimension?

15:31.053 --> 15:32.327
Of course not.

15:32.493 --> 15:37.328
I had a few of my faithful move her
to a secure location for her protection.

15:38.893 --> 15:40.884
Who? Who took her?

15:41.053 --> 15:45.171
It doesn't matter.
Just know she's alive...

15:45.693 --> 15:47.604
...and, well, comatose.

15:48.613 --> 15:51.810
And under constant guard...

15:51.973 --> 15:55.010

are supposed to be.

16:15.613 --> 16:18.173
Valor? What you call justice?

16:18.333 --> 16:20.642
Your friends are dead, most likely.

16:22.453 --> 16:25.763

doesn't want you.

It needs me.

16:38.733 --> 16:41.406
So your Powers That Be tell you.
Maybe they're right.

16:41.573 --> 16:43.848
But it's not why you're here.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.971
Okay, Bugsy, you wanna tell me
what I'm fighting for?

16:53.133 --> 16:54.851
- Him.
- Him?

16:55.013 --> 16:57.925
The boy. The woman you've already lost.

16:58.533 --> 17:00.569
The boy is what you're fighting for.

17:00.733 --> 17:04.248
But you're going to fail.
You're going to lose him too.

17:25.053 --> 17:28.045
I almost envy them.
The first time you see Jasmine.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.329
- Nothing like it.
- Yeah.

since I've been here.

17:41.333 --> 17:43.767
- You know what I mean? Oh.
- Sorry.

17:43.933 --> 17:46.288
- You kind of smell like...
- Cordelia.

17:47.053 --> 17:51.604
Yeah. I read this was her
favorite perfume.

17:52.453 --> 17:54.728
Don't you think we're really
fortunate to be here?

17:54.893 --> 17:58.488
I just feel so blessed to
actually have this opportunity...

17:58.653 --> 18:02.248
Hi. Tracy Bellows, KTLA.
Could I get you to say a few words?

18:02.413 --> 18:04.688
This is a special day,
and as Jasmine's father...

18:04.853 --> 18:06.684
...you must be so proud and...

18:07.973 --> 18:09.452
Okay, back to you, Hal.

JEREMY: A guy in there
says the Lakers disbanded.

18:19.173 --> 18:21.733
Evidently the players needed
more time to devote to her.

- Hi, Mr...
- Jasmine's dad!

18:25.973 --> 18:28.885
- Connor.
- Connor.

18:29.053 --> 18:32.648
- Jasmine. For the press conference.
- Right, because she needs more of that.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.685
Listen...

18:35.853 --> 18:38.321
...you're the guys
who moved Cordelia, right?

18:40.293 --> 18:44.332
- I kind of need to know where she is.
- You must've got your wires crossed.

18:44.493 --> 18:46.165
Right, Brent?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.767
We didn't do anything
with the Transcendent Mother.

18:50.093 --> 18:53.051
Hey, it's okay. Jasmine told me
you two helped move her.

18:53.413 --> 18:55.722
I mean, how else would I know, right?

18:56.453 --> 19:00.571
Sorry, Connor. You're just
gonna have to ask Jasmine.

19:01.453 --> 19:02.727
I'm asking you.

19:06.933 --> 19:08.252
I can smell her on you.

19:08.693 --> 19:11.207
So tell me, and I'll crush your windpipe.

19:11.373 --> 19:15.685
You mean "or," right?
Or you'll crush my windpipe?

19:16.133 --> 19:17.612
Where's Cordy?

19:19.013 --> 19:21.686
So much effort. Always struggling.

19:21.853 --> 19:25.528
Try to make things right for the boy,
for Connor.

19:25.693 --> 19:28.332
But it's never enough.
Why do you bother?

A means to an end.

19:39.213 --> 19:41.329
Well, people get born
for all sorts of reasons.

19:43.493 --> 19:45.404
- He will never love you.
- Doesn't matter.

Hey, you can stop that any time now.

20:03.413 --> 20:04.812
I will.

Just as soon as somebody comes up
with a better idea to get us out of here.

20:11.693 --> 20:13.285
LORNE:
And then what, Kato?

20:13.453 --> 20:16.650
The anti-Jasmine crowd's about to
become a minority on this planet.

20:16.813 --> 20:19.202
Yeah, well, first things first.

Weird, Connor walking out like that,
you know?

20:27.373 --> 20:29.568
- Leaving us unguarded.
- Yeah.

20:29.733 --> 20:32.327
If he's not careful, we might
move about freely in our...

20:32.493 --> 20:35.166
...impervious, 10-by-9 steel cage.

20:35.493 --> 20:37.370
Maybe we were getting to him.

20:37.533 --> 20:39.285
More than likely...

20:39.453 --> 20:42.206
...Her Godliness summoned him
for a little tender, loving...

20:42.373 --> 20:43.931
WESLEY:
Blood.

20:45.613 --> 20:49.367
Is that some kind of ritual
she has him doing? Because... ew.

20:49.693 --> 20:50.967
What?

20:51.133 --> 20:53.044
Oh, no, I was just thinking.

20:53.213 --> 20:55.681
Cordelia's blood,
it had the same power...

20:55.853 --> 20:59.243
...as Jasmine's to break the thrall
she had over us.

20:59.413 --> 21:02.485
So we figured. Mother and daughter,
they share the same blood.

21:03.213 --> 21:07.365
And now she's been moved.
Cordelia. Why?

21:07.533 --> 21:10.570
I guess so people like us don't use
Cordy's blood against Jasmine.

21:10.733 --> 21:14.043
There are no people like us,
not anymore. We're it.

21:14.213 --> 21:16.522
She had us on the run.

21:17.773 --> 21:22.164
And if Cordelia's so dangerous to her,
why not kill her and be done with it?

21:23.933 --> 21:25.491
Because maybe she can't.

21:25.653 --> 21:29.612
Exactly. I think Jasmine
may be dependent on Cordelia.

21:29.773 --> 21:33.402
She can't hurt her,
not without hurting herself.

21:34.453 --> 21:37.286
But maybe Cordelia can hurt Jasmine.

21:37.453 --> 21:39.250
- It's a lot of maybes.
WESLEY: Maybe.

21:39.413 --> 21:42.928
But if I'm right, Cordelia might be
our only hope to stop Jasmine.

21:43.413 --> 21:45.210
If we can wake her up.

21:45.373 --> 21:48.763
Wake her? We have to find her first.

22:27.773 --> 22:29.525
COP 1: Hi.
COP 2: Hi.

22:29.813 --> 22:31.087
Hi.

22:31.253 --> 22:34.165
Sorry, but you're
not supposed to be in here.

22:34.533 --> 22:36.251
Really? I had no idea.

22:36.413 --> 22:38.881
Yeah, nobody's allowed in.
Jasmine's order.

22:39.053 --> 22:42.807
Well, not order per se.
More like a request, really.

22:43.613 --> 22:46.047
I mean, it's not like she
actually gives orders.

22:46.213 --> 22:47.692
It's not in her nature.

22:47.853 --> 22:50.048
It's one of the things I love about her.

22:50.213 --> 22:52.807
- She treats everyone with equal...
- I need to get in here.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.251
Okay, friend, we're not communicating.

22:57.413 --> 22:58.687
You can't.

22:58.853 --> 23:00.684

24:09.533 --> 24:11.649

24:11.813 --> 24:13.405
I'm sorry I haven't...

24:22.093 --> 24:23.811
It's started, Cordy.

24:24.453 --> 24:26.045
The new beginning.

24:26.213 --> 24:28.124
I just wish you'd wake up and see it.

...the way that Angel likes it
so that he has a reason to fight.

25:10.413 --> 25:13.485
Because, you know, that's what
he's about, him and the others.

25:13.653 --> 25:16.247
Finding reasons to fight.

any meaning.

25:50.253 --> 25:52.403
But I can't.

26:00.933 --> 26:03.447
It's not working, Cordy.

26:05.013 --> 26:06.651
I tried.

26:08.133 --> 26:10.044
I tried to believe.

26:11.053 --> 26:12.805
I wanted it...

26:13.413 --> 26:15.404
...went along with...

was better than the others.

Jasmine's world debut, I expect.

29:37.413 --> 29:38.812
So...

29:39.173 --> 29:40.845
...we're alone.

29:41.533 --> 29:43.205
It's just us now.

29:43.373 --> 29:45.250
That's all, folks.

29:46.413 --> 29:50.167
Now, I know you have lots
of important questions for me.

29:50.333 --> 29:53.291
Difficult questions.
And I want you to know everything.

29:53.453 --> 29:56.013
So I'm going to open up the floor.

29:57.013 --> 29:58.605
Yes, Tracy?

29:59.613 --> 30:00.966
You know my name?

30:01.293 --> 30:03.682
That's right. You have a question?

30:04.293 --> 30:06.249
You know my name.

30:06.413 --> 30:09.371
- Anyone else?
- Excuse me, Jasmine.

30:10.373 --> 30:12.967
What can we do to show
our love for you?

30:13.133 --> 30:16.682
You don't have to do anything
except love one another.

30:19.693 --> 30:23.129
Although a temple would be nice.

30:24.453 --> 30:28.810
Something massive and awe-inspiring,
yet warm and nurturing...

30:28.973 --> 30:34.093
...celebrating the gentle pleasures
of a peaceful, precious coexistence...

30:34.253 --> 30:36.244
...where violent behavior...

30:47.813 --> 30:50.043
Kill him, all of you! Kill him now!

- Don't.

No!

Please, pay no attention. It's a lie.

See? I'm not...!

31:27.213 --> 31:29.044
Wait.

31:29.213 --> 31:31.488
Please, don't leave me.

31:43.093 --> 31:44.845
What in the hell was going on
up there?

31:45.013 --> 31:47.402
It didn't sound good.
I don't know what...

31:48.413 --> 31:51.211
I'll tell you what it was.
The Devourer chowing down.

31:52.493 --> 31:54.688
- I bet you we're dessert.
- Gunn, stop wasting...

31:58.053 --> 32:00.567
Never give up. Never surrender.

32:01.053 --> 32:03.772
- Let's go.
- That's it? No "thank you"?

32:03.933 --> 32:06.163

33:08.533 --> 33:11.093
It's over. You've lost.

33:11.613 --> 33:12.887
JASMINE:
I've lost?

33:13.413 --> 33:15.369
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

33:15.533 --> 33:16.807
What I had to do.

33:16.973 --> 33:19.168
No. No, Angel.

33:19.333 --> 33:21.244
There are no absolutes.

33:21.413 --> 33:25.406
No right and wrong. Haven't you learned
anything working for the Powers?

33:26.133 --> 33:28.249
There are only choices.

33:28.413 --> 33:31.962
I offered paradise. You chose this.

33:32.133 --> 33:33.407
Because I could.

33:33.573 --> 33:36.326
Because that's what you
took away from us. Choice.

33:36.573 --> 33:38.529
And look where free will has gotten you.

33:38.733 --> 33:42.726
Hey, I didn't say we were smart.
I said it's our right.

33:42.893 --> 33:46.090
- It's what makes us human.
- But you're not human.

33:46.573 --> 33:48.291
Working on it.

33:48.453 --> 33:50.250
- Where are you going?

But I'll die before I let you
hurt anyone else.

34:00.293 --> 34:02.887
- You're already dead.
- You know what I mean.

34:03.053 --> 34:04.930
It ends right here.

34:05.133 --> 34:07.010

Hey, you eat people.

34:16.453 --> 34:18.011
Like you never have?

34:18.172 --> 34:21.370
Thousands of people are dead
because of what you've done.

34:21.533 --> 34:24.366
And how many will die because of you?

34:24.612 --> 34:26.922
I could've stopped it, Angel.

34:27.092 --> 34:28.446
All of it.

War, disease, poverty.
How many precious, beautiful lives...

...I murdered thousands
to save billions.

34:44.572 --> 34:47.724
This world is doomed to drown
in its own blood now.

34:49.092 --> 34:51.163
The price was too high, Jasmine.

and make up for it.

the world that you wanted.

Maybe you could help us
make it better...

...even if you have
lost your powers.

Maybe you're right.

Never really did.
You know that's true in your heart.
