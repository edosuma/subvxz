04:32.480 --> 04:34.244
Please, my love.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.051
Please, my dearest.
Do not be upset.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.248
It was a mistake.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.041
I didn't know she was
in this condition. My love, please.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.045
Please, my love...

05:23.880 --> 05:25.848
Forgive me, my love.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.244
I will make you happy.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.650
Who are you?

06:24.280 --> 06:26.442
I would not bother you

06:26.680 --> 06:30.048
if I were not certain
that Your Majesties

06:30.280 --> 06:34.569
will attach great importance
to what I'm about to say.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.168
I've heard the promises
of many charlatans before.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.171
And you have put many
in the stocks.

06:41.400 --> 06:45.121
Fortunately,
that does not concern me.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.931
You seem very sure of yourself.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.048
What will it cost?

06:52.280 --> 06:55.489
An act of courage and of sacrifice.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.484
What d'you mean by that?

06:57.720 --> 07:01.281
Birth is always stained by death.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.286
And death, in turn,
is simply one element of birth

07:06.120 --> 07:09.488
and not even the most dramatic one.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.883
Be less mysterious.
Come to the point.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.684
You want a child?

07:18.920 --> 07:22.891
Every new life
calls for a life to be lost.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.251
The equilibrium of the world
must be maintained.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.644
Do you understand?

07:30.000 --> 07:34.164
I am prepared to die in order
to feel life grow inside me.

07:34.680 --> 07:38.651
We are speaking of possibility,
not certainty.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.131
Are you willing to accept the risk?

07:42.360 --> 07:44.124
What must we do?

07:48.080 --> 07:51.050
Hunt down a sea monster.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.451
Cut out its heart
and have it cooked by a virgin.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.445
But she must be alone.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.166
When Your Majesty eats the heart

08:05.000 --> 08:09.961
you will become pregnant
instantly.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.444
Which is the girl?

13:15.680 --> 13:17.444
You, come here.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.248
You are still a virgin, right?

13:24.880 --> 13:27.042
Come with me,
the queen needs you.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.645
Hurry UP!

15:26.480 --> 15:29.450
It's coming, Your Majesty.
It's coming.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.650
What's happening?
What's happening?

18:52.720 --> 18:55.690
SIXTEEN YEARS LATER

18:59.480 --> 19:01.050
Elias!

19:09.280 --> 19:10.850
Elias!

19:11.480 --> 19:13.642
Where are you, my boy?

19:23.480 --> 19:25.050
Stop!

19:26.880 --> 19:28.644
Elias!

21:56.480 --> 21:58.244
<i>Your Highness!</i>

22:04.280 --> 22:06.044
<i>Your Highness!</i>

22:17.280 --> 22:18.645
<i>Your Highness!</i>

22:35.280 --> 22:36.850
<i>Your Highness!</i>

22:48.120 --> 22:49.690
Your Highness!

22:52.480 --> 22:54.244
Your Highness!

22:58.880 --> 23:02.248
Why must you continue
to disobey my commands?

23:03.280 --> 23:05.248
How many times have I told you?

23:06.480 --> 23:09.245
They must stop seeing each other.

23:10.680 --> 23:15.049
The next time that bastard boy
of yours comes anywhere near my son

23:15.480 --> 23:17.323
I will throw you both out.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.645
You understand?

23:21.080 --> 23:22.650
Don't look at me!

23:24.640 --> 23:26.210
Now go.

23:37.480 --> 23:41.451
What does she have to do with this?
What has she done wrong?

23:42.880 --> 23:45.451
Take it out on me if you have to,
but leave her out of it.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.842
How dare you talk to me like that?

23:48.080 --> 23:50.651
You disrespect me
and you disobey me.

23:50.880 --> 23:53.247
You know you were not supposed
to see him.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.650
Come here.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.242
Elias, you are a prince.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.250
You cannot befriend
of a son of a servant.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.842
But I like being with him.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.090
He's like a brother to me,
I will see him whenever I want.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.685
A brother?

24:16.920 --> 24:20.686
The only one bond of blood
that you have is with me.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.890
Your mother!

24:23.480 --> 24:27.451
And it's to me that you owe
respect and obedience.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.650
I am your queen,
don't you ever forget it.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.684
You owe me an apology.

24:39.080 --> 24:40.570
I'm sorry, mother.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.245
Come.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.445
My son...

25:01.680 --> 25:05.651
If I ever see you with him again,
you will both regret it.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.643
Who sings with
such a beautiful voice?

27:31.680 --> 27:34.650
Where have you been hiding
all this time?

27:36.080 --> 27:39.050
How is it that I have never met you?

27:39.280 --> 27:41.647
Never even seen you?

27:43.480 --> 27:45.448
How old are you?

27:46.080 --> 27:47.844
Seventeen?

27:48.480 --> 27:50.244
Eighteen?

27:51.480 --> 27:54.643
No, don't go! Don't go!
Don't hide!

27:54.880 --> 27:57.042
Stay out in the sunlight.

27:57.280 --> 28:02.571
Please, stay out
to warm your cold king.

28:04.280 --> 28:09.241
Oh I see!
So you want to play hard to get.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.844
Well, so be it.

28:12.480 --> 28:15.450
I have fought many wars in my time.

28:16.080 --> 28:21.689
And even the most impregnable
fortress surrenders at last.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.441
<i>Who is it?</i>

28:52.680 --> 28:55.047
I have a gift for you,
from your king.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.050
What is it?

29:45.080 --> 29:46.844
It's beautiful!

29:48.680 --> 29:51.251
- Let me try it, Dora.
- Wait.

29:51.480 --> 29:52.845
Wait!

29:53.080 --> 29:56.846
- Dora, please...
- Get the mirror.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.045
Stop it!

30:12.880 --> 30:15.247
You don't think
we have to give it back?

30:15.880 --> 30:17.848
To the king?

30:19.080 --> 30:20.080
No.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.848
What good is it to us?

30:23.480 --> 30:26.450
Makes us look more beautiful.
Don't you think?

30:26.680 --> 30:30.048
But whoever sees us?
We're always shut up inside here.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.450
I see you, silly.

30:38.280 --> 30:39.850
There...

30:40.880 --> 30:43.042
Okay, I'll keep this.

30:58.040 --> 31:01.408
- At the closing of the day, oh Lord.
- Watch over us as we sleep.

31:01.640 --> 31:04.610
Keep us safe and warm in Your heart.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.245
Who is it?

31:39.480 --> 31:42.848
<i>It's me... your king.</i>

31:44.880 --> 31:46.848
Did you like my present?

31:47.680 --> 31:49.648
Have you tried it on?

31:51.680 --> 31:54.445
<i>My royal heart is very generous,
you know?</i>

31:57.080 --> 31:59.686
<i>Ever since this morning
when I first heard you sing,</i>

31:59.920 --> 32:02.491
I have been burning
in the furnace of desire. Come on!

32:02.720 --> 32:05.087
Open up this door,
so I can see you.

32:10.680 --> 32:11.727
Hello?

32:12.880 --> 32:15.451
Sir, there must be
some misunderstanding...

32:20.080 --> 32:21.650
I see...

32:23.080 --> 32:25.447
You are going to tease me,
aren't you?

32:28.080 --> 32:30.447
Let me see you, for heaven's sake!

32:36.080 --> 32:38.048
You like playing with your king?

32:38.880 --> 32:40.848
Play with you, sir?

32:41.080 --> 32:43.048
Oh no!

32:43.280 --> 32:47.490
I'm just a poor girl, I don't deserve
the honor you bestow on me.

32:49.080 --> 32:53.051
The honor! What honor!
It's desire that drives me.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.045
Open up this door, let me in.
Let me see you, for damned sake!

32:57.080 --> 33:00.050
- Dora, what shall we do?
- Let me think.

33:00.280 --> 33:03.045
We must not let
an opportunity like this get away.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.447
- Your Majesty...
- Yes?

33:06.680 --> 33:10.048
You can't imagine how the modesty
of this young virgin

33:10.280 --> 33:12.647
is being put to the test
by your offer.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.245
I...

33:15.880 --> 33:18.247
All my heart's aflutter.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.448
I feel faint.

33:21.080 --> 33:24.050
But all I can promise you today

33:24.280 --> 33:26.248
is this:

33:26.480 --> 33:29.848
come back in a week's time

33:30.080 --> 33:32.651
and I will give you a part of me

33:32.880 --> 33:35.850
that alone illustrates my beauty.

33:37.880 --> 33:42.841
Which part of your body
will you grant me?

33:47.280 --> 33:50.841
A finger, Your Majesty.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.650
A finger?

33:58.480 --> 34:00.050
A finger...

34:03.080 --> 34:08.449
Well... All right, my jasmine flower,
my little honeysuckle.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.650
I shall wait

34:11.880 --> 34:15.851
and I shall return and admire
the eighth wonder of the world,

34:16.080 --> 34:18.650
your rosy maidenly finger.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.447
What shall we do, Dora?

34:27.280 --> 34:28.850
We'll think of something.

35:05.080 --> 35:08.448
This next piece
I composed myself for my father,

35:08.680 --> 35:10.682
to whom I dedicate it
with all my heart.

37:58.200 --> 38:01.443
"He grabs the iron bars
pulling and shaking them,

38:01.680 --> 38:04.843
bending the metal and tearing
the bars from the wall."

38:05.080 --> 38:08.050
Could you just read the part
where they kiss?

38:11.080 --> 38:14.050
"Then the queen her arms extends,

38:14.280 --> 38:17.045
and to her breast his head she bends,

38:17.280 --> 38:20.250
and on the bed in warm embrace,

38:20.480 --> 38:23.245
the queen displays her radiant face."

38:24.080 --> 38:26.651
Now Lancelot has what he desires,

38:26.880 --> 38:29.645
the queen's embrace sets him on fire,

38:29.920 --> 38:34.050
so sweet a game to kiss and hold.

38:34.280 --> 38:37.648
Such pleasure this, if truth be told,

38:37.880 --> 38:42.249
no one ever felt before,
such joy in loving they adore."

38:45.280 --> 38:46.850
And now we should leave.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.448
Could we read it again?

39:05.480 --> 39:07.448
- <i>Your Majesty.</i>
- Yes?

39:07.680 --> 39:10.650
- <i>Some papers to sign.</i>
- Later Later

39:10.880 --> 39:14.851
<i>Fm sorry, Your Majesty, they are
rather urgent, people want paying.</i>

39:15.080 --> 39:17.048
All is so urgent.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.804
<i>My lord and father,</i>

40:02.040 --> 40:04.611
at my age a girl
should already know

40:04.840 --> 40:07.446
what sort of gallantries
men are capable of.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.210
She should be learning to distinguish
whose heart is sincere

40:12.440 --> 40:14.329
and who instead tells lies.

40:14.560 --> 40:18.690
If I stay here,
my head will always be empty,

40:18.920 --> 40:21.127
and I fear my heart will be too.

40:21.360 --> 40:25.922
Before long you will be
old enough to be married

40:26.160 --> 40:29.084
and then you will depart
these walls forever

40:30.080 --> 40:31.445
Well...

40:32.480 --> 40:35.450
If that is indeed the case,

40:35.680 --> 40:37.648
then find me a husband.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.450
A husband?

40:43.280 --> 40:45.965
What sort of husband would you like?

40:46.680 --> 40:50.048
Well...
I'd like my husband to be

40:50.280 --> 40:54.046
courageous and strong and...

40:55.080 --> 40:56.650
handsome.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.167
I'm sure such a man exists,

40:59.400 --> 41:01.368
but until we find him,

41:01.600 --> 41:02.965
Please,

41:03.200 --> 41:07.171
do not agitate yourself over a future
none of us can predict.

41:07.400 --> 41:10.165
Now, let us finish our supper.

41:18.720 --> 41:21.291
- What is it, my dear?
- It's not cooked enough.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.245
Really?

41:42.880 --> 41:45.645
Yes, yes, yes...

41:47.080 --> 41:48.445
Hello?

41:52.280 --> 41:53.645
Hello?

44:03.280 --> 44:05.044
Elias!

44:14.680 --> 44:16.444
Come, my boy.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.650
Come near me.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.531
I can't make up my mind
about the earrings tonight.

44:24.760 --> 44:27.730
Would you help me?
Which one do you like better.

44:32.560 --> 44:33.925
Should we try them on?

44:43.880 --> 44:45.644
Did you take your lesson?

44:47.080 --> 44:48.650
Yes, earlier.

45:04.680 --> 45:06.444
Ma'? I go now?

45:07.480 --> 45:08.845
Of course.

45:10.680 --> 45:12.045
Good night.

45:17.080 --> 45:18.445
Elias...

45:19.480 --> 45:21.448
You won't believe this.

45:21.680 --> 45:22.841
What happened?

45:23.280 --> 45:25.248
I was just in your mother's room.

45:26.680 --> 45:29.843
- What?
- Don't worry. I was in her room.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.244
She thought I was you.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.048
No... impossible...

45:36.680 --> 45:39.047
- You are playing with me.
- She thought I was you.

45:39.280 --> 45:42.204
I was in her room... me!

45:42.880 --> 45:45.645
<i>- You are not joking?
- She thought I was you, I swear.</i>

45:45.880 --> 45:48.042
<i>She actually called me Elias.</i>

45:49.480 --> 45:51.448
Do you know what this means?

45:52.480 --> 45:53.845
What?

45:54.480 --> 45:57.245
If we've managed to fool
even my mother,

45:57.680 --> 45:59.887
we can do whatever we want.

46:01.880 --> 46:04.645
- What?
- I'll be eighteen soon.

46:06.080 --> 46:10.051
Then I'll have the throne and
we can take it in turns being king.

46:10.280 --> 46:12.044
- What? Take turns?
- Yes.

46:12.280 --> 46:14.647
<i>Me one day, you the next.
What do you say?</i>

46:15.080 --> 46:17.242
<i>- Me, king?
- Yes.</i>

46:17.480 --> 46:19.448
<i>Imagine how happy my mother will be.</i>

46:20.080 --> 46:22.048
<i>You could do whatever you wanted.</i>

46:22.280 --> 46:24.647
<i>Maybe I could make her a noblewoman</i>

46:24.880 --> 46:26.848
<i>and maybe she could have
a little castle as well.</i>

46:27.080 --> 46:30.448
We're king,
we don't have to listen anybody.

46:30.680 --> 46:32.648
We could give her
everything she desires.

46:33.080 --> 46:35.048
- Everything.
- Just perfect!

46:36.280 --> 46:38.442
But we have to keep this a secret.

46:38.680 --> 46:39.680
Yes!

46:39.880 --> 46:42.042
Between you and me, nobody can know.

46:44.280 --> 46:47.045
- Who is <i>it?</i>
<i>- It's me, your mother.</i>

46:49.080 --> 46:50.650
One moment!

46:51.200 --> 46:52.200
This way.

46:52.400 --> 46:53.970
Jonah, my jacket!

46:55.880 --> 46:57.644
Help me.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.404
Come in, mother.

47:06.880 --> 47:08.450
What is it?

47:10.080 --> 47:14.051
Nothing...
I just wanted to see you.

47:24.280 --> 47:26.442
You have my hands.

47:27.080 --> 47:30.448
Even though you were inside me
only one night,

47:30.680 --> 47:33.081
you still managed to take on my form.

47:36.520 --> 47:39.285
You have no idea
how much I wanted you.

47:41.280 --> 47:44.250
How much I sacrificed for you.

47:45.400 --> 47:47.368
You told me many times before.

47:52.480 --> 47:55.450
No one will ever love you like I do.

48:18.880 --> 48:20.450
See you tomorrow?

48:21.080 --> 48:22.241
Yes.

50:43.480 --> 50:45.289
Your Highness, please.

51:00.360 --> 51:01.930
Your Highness!

51:04.680 --> 51:07.047
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

51:07.880 --> 51:09.245
Jonah!

51:10.080 --> 51:11.844
What are you doing?

51:14.680 --> 51:17.251
Jonah! Why are you leaving?

51:17.480 --> 51:19.050
I have to go.

51:19.880 --> 51:21.006
Why? What's happened?

51:21.240 --> 51:23.641
I have to, don't ask me
anything more.

51:23.880 --> 51:25.848
You can't just leave like this.

51:26.080 --> 51:28.048
I've made up my mind,
I have no choice.

51:28.280 --> 51:30.248
Please, be well and don't forget me.

51:31.280 --> 51:32.441
No!

51:32.680 --> 51:35.843
I'm your king and
I order you to stay.

51:40.080 --> 51:42.845
Come... Look.

52:04.280 --> 52:07.443
You come to this spring every day

52:08.080 --> 52:10.447
and here you will see
the flow of my life.

52:11.080 --> 52:13.242
If the water runs clear,

52:13.480 --> 52:16.051
you will know that my life too
is clear and serene.

52:16.280 --> 52:20.046
If it runs muddy,
you will know that I am in trouble.

52:21.280 --> 52:26.047
If it dries up, you will know
that I have too reached my end.

53:20.880 --> 53:23.451
You! Stop that!

53:26.080 --> 53:27.844
Get away from here!

53:28.680 --> 53:30.045
Go!

55:10.680 --> 55:12.444
Dora...

55:14.480 --> 55:16.050
Dora...

55:25.480 --> 55:27.847
<i>Here I am, my little darling.</i>

55:30.480 --> 55:33.643
<i>Having counted the days
and numbered the nights,</i>

55:33.880 --> 55:35.848
<i>at long last,</i>

55:36.640 --> 55:38.608
your king is here.

55:39.840 --> 55:41.001
Now...

55:42.040 --> 55:46.204
my precious one,
show me what you promised.

55:54.080 --> 55:55.809
Dora! Dora!

56:07.480 --> 56:09.050
Beautiful!

56:09.280 --> 56:11.248
So soft and tender.

56:13.280 --> 56:15.044
Sweet smelling.

56:23.680 --> 56:26.047
Now, my dearest heart,

56:26.280 --> 56:29.250
now that you have shown me
your beautiful finger,

56:29.680 --> 56:33.241
show me the rest,
show me your face,

56:33.480 --> 56:37.565
show me your mouth, your neck,
sol can kiss it. Please!

56:45.280 --> 56:48.250
Now courtesy demands that I ask

56:48.480 --> 56:51.768
for something that
I could freely take,

56:52.000 --> 56:53.764
without any pretext.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.968
I'm your king, don't forget!

56:57.680 --> 56:59.250
Your Majesty...

56:59.680 --> 57:01.250
my royal lord,

57:02.080 --> 57:04.651
since you have deigned

57:04.880 --> 57:08.248
to demean yourself,
leaving your lofty chambers

57:08.480 --> 57:11.051
to come to this lowly pigsty,

57:11.280 --> 57:16.047
far be it from me to dispute
the will of such a great king.

57:16.480 --> 57:18.847
Therefore...

57:19.080 --> 57:21.048
I am ready

57:21.280 --> 57:23.647
and willing to grant your desires.

57:24.680 --> 57:29.447
I only ask of you this one favor.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.250
Of course.

57:31.480 --> 57:34.450
<i>I be welcomed into your bed</i>

57:34.680 --> 57:37.251
<i>in the darkness of the night,</i>

57:37.480 --> 57:39.448
<i>without any candles,</i>

57:39.680 --> 57:42.650
<i>for my heart could not withstand</i>

57:42.880 --> 57:45.247
<i>you seeing me naked.</i>

57:46.280 --> 57:48.851
Of course, my beautiful angel.

57:49.080 --> 57:50.650
Anything you like.

58:21.680 --> 58:23.250
Do it!

58:25.880 --> 58:27.450
More.

58:30.080 --> 58:32.845
Let me see. Let me see.

58:33.080 --> 58:34.844
Okay. Hold it.

58:35.480 --> 58:36.845
Hold it.

58:41.880 --> 58:44.451
Good... good...

58:46.680 --> 58:48.250
And the other one.

58:49.880 --> 58:51.848
Shut up, Imma!

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.490
Keep us safe and warm
in your heart.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.448
Always and forever and ever,
keep us warm...

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.445
And safe from everything.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.050
Guards!

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.050
Guards!

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.448
You summoned me, Your Majesty.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.808
Silence!
You tricked me, you witch!

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.924
Throw her out.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.525
No!

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.411
Throw her out. Now! Do it!

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.447
You wanted me to come!

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.442
What are you doing up there?

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.448
There is nothing to laugh at.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.642
I'm not funny!

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.966
- Help me down!
- Yes, I'll help you down.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.247
You shouldn't be up in a tree
at your age.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.244
Help me down.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.047
Oh dear, oh dear...

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.048
All this complaining.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.844
Now, now...

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.044
Come on now.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.447
There we go.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.450
Come on... Come on...

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.850
There...

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.848
This too will pass.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.248
Everything passes.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.847
Doctor! Doctor!

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.447
Come quick, the king
needs you right away.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.648
I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.848
Your Majesty, the doctor!

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.648
It's a respiratory problem.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.848
What are your symptoms?

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.048
Not me! Not me!

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.448
- Come.
- What's this?

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.170
Come!

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.645
Come... Please...

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.043
- Come!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.648
Please... Please...

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:33.051
- What is this?
- I don't know what beast this is!

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.647
Oh dear! That's not good.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.250
Do something!

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.242
Your Highness...

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.048
Oh, dear...

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.850
Your Highness...

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.650
Unfortunately...

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.240
Doctor...

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.649
You must tell no one
of what you have seen this evening.

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:26.647
- Your Majesty...
- No one!

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.447
This is my favorite color.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:06.848
- I love this.
- Neckline is very attractive.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.651
So have you found
something to please you?

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.850
Yes. They are all so beautiful.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.247
Why did you send for them?

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.649
You want to look beautiful
on your wedding day, don't you?

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:28.051
So, I'm to be married?

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:29.850
Of course.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.845
You were right, Violet.
It's time I found you a husband.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.448
I understand you are bored
living here with us at the castle

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:41.241
and in this way you can venture forth
and discover new places.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:45.041
- It's what you wanted.
- Yes!

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:48.250
Then, who will my husband be, father?

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:50.050
Well...

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:53.848
He will be braver than
the most valiant knight

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.050
and wiser even than
our own court doctor

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.245
Thank you.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.326
- What is his name?
- Not even I know his name yet.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.448
How can that be?
Do you not know him?

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.851
Surely, as an avid reader
you know that

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.243
the husband of a princess can only
be discovered through a tournament.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.048
So I won't choose him myself.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.282
What if I don't love him?

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.051
You will love him, Violet.
You will.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.647
Of course, it is possible that
no suitor will pass the test.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.444
Then what will I do?

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.445
Then fate will have decided

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.048
that you must live a while longer
with your old father.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.850
Your turn.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.248
This is the hide of a sow.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.045
No.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.050
Next!

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.050
- He is very serious.
- He's old.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.729
Verrus singularis silvano.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.445
No.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.923
Verrus singularis silvano... No!

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.730
Next!

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.442
- Father...
- A moment!

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.243
- What is it?
- Please, I'm longing to know.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.450
Just tell me what piece
that strange hide belongs to.

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.444
No, it's forbidden.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.045
- I won't tell a soul.
- It's impossible.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.848
I'm your daughter!

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.441
Oh very well, I can deny you nothing.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.250
You wish to know to which beast
this hide belongs?

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.641
Yes.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.250
It is the skin of a flea.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.645
Continue.

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.490
Giant manatee.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.044
Sorry.

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.645
No.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.290
Next!

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.445
No, no...

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.850
Everyone has the right to guess.

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.048
- Father...
- It's fine.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.045
Flea.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.881
What?

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.727
Flea!

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.445
Violet!

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.845
No!

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.445
Violet!

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.250
No! Wait!

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.564
Please, stop!

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.165
I never imagined anyone would guess.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.850
I'm sorry.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.650
I understand.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:12.444
It was never my intention that
I would give you to such a monster.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.043
But what can I do?
You heard the proclamation.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.443
I can't go back on my word.
Violet!

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.248
Patience, my blessed child.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.645
Perhaps... Perhaps... Violet...

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:33.444
Perhaps the will of God
is behind this unusual fate.

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.850
I know you are scared but...

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:42.644
My heart tells me that
you will find a strength to be happy.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.250
Happy?

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.441
You tried to deceive me
with your words, father!

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.048
Your heart tells you?
You have no heart!

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.046
Silence! You forget the duties
and obligations of a king.

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.648
You're not a king.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.448
You're not even a man.

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.648
Not even a beast.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.850
Beasts at least love their offspring.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.048
They try to protect them.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.443
But not you. I'm nothing to you.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.251
I wish that my mother
had strangled me in my crib

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.209
instead of leaving me in your hands.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.010
Silence!

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.607
Whatever I do is done well.

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:33.642
No one has the right to question
my will, least of all my daughter!

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.649
Fear not,
your obligations shall be respected.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.851
No one will be able to say that
the king did not keep to his word.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.045
Sit.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.845
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,
I've looked everywhere.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.650
I can't find him.

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:48.042
What d'you mean, you can't find him?

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.848
<i>Your Highness!</i>

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.844
Elias!

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.050
<i>Your Highness!</i>

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.645
It's him!

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:53.849
He's back! Fenizia!

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:56.128
He's back, Jonah is alive!

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:06.050
Jonah, my love! Jonah!

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.842
We knew you would come back to us.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.651
You have no idea how long
we've been looking for you!

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.848
How much time has passed?

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.048
I'm...
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:45.442
Five days.
You've been gone five days.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.444
Where did I go?

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.048
The forest.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.650
The forest...
Why was I in the forest?

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.650
Where is he?

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.448
He is searching for his friend.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.646
You wanted to separate
what is inseparable.

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.848
I want my son back.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.690
Now I will repeat what I told you.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:27.046
Every desire, every action
corresponds to another

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.645
A violent desire such as yours

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.406
can only be satisfied with violence.

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.203
And there will be a cost.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.807
You know I'm willing to pay it.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.045
Jonah!

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.330
Jonah, can you hear me?

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:51.445
Help!

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.848
I'm here, help me!

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.045
Help!

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.447
I'm here! Help me!

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.850
<i>Jonah!</i>

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.450
Elias!

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.645
Help!

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.887
- I'm coming!
- Help me!

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:27.488
- Quick! Help me!
- Don't worry, I'm here.

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.844
Quick! Oh, my God!

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.250
An invitation to the king's wedding.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.644
Who sent it to me?

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.048
The future queen.

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.645
Dora...

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.445
Imma!

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:37.045
It's me.

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.848
It's me, Dora.

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:48.848
I've missed you so much!

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:51.845
Imma...

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.650
It's me.

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.445
Dora.

01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:00.244
I don't know what happened.

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.244
I fell asleep.

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.850
When I woke up
I had changed my skin.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.248
What do you mean?

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:14.051
I changed my skin, I don't know...

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.848
You're so beautiful.

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.048
Young...

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.850
Dora...

01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.845
From now on, you don't have
to worry about a thing.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.048
I'll take care of you.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:43.648
Anything you want,
it will be yours.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.045
Dora...

01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:55.042
- I have to go now.
- No!

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.647
I'll come back,

01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.848
but remember,

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.048
this has to be our secret.

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.248
Not a word to anyone.

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.048
Dora, wait... Wait!

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:05.047
The queen is my sister.

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.642
No! No!

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:45.845
I have to stay here with my sister.

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.048
Yes, I'm sure she's your sister,

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.647
but it's time to go, the party is
over and the guests are leaving.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.850
I'm not a guest.
I'm the queen's sister.

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.844
- Get up!
- No, I'm staying here.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.650
You are not listening to me, get up!

01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:00.247
- You may go now.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:02.244
Dora, they want me to leave.

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.644
What did I tell you?

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.850
You have to keep quiet. Remember?

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.051
- It's a secret.
- I want to be with you.

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.248
You can't be with me.

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:17.445
- Do you want me to lose everything?
- No.

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:19.444
So you need to go.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.045
Go!

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.445
- I want to be with you.
- I said go!

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:37.045
Go!

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.805
Dora...

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.247
I thought maybe I could sleep here.

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:02.847
I'm tired of being alone.

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.846
Listen to me, you can't stay here,
no one must see you, you have to go.

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:10.050
- I want to be with you.
- And you can't.

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:13.250
- Why?
- Take a look at yourself, Imma!

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:15.448
You're old.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.648
No one would believe we are sisters.

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.450
I want to become young too.
I want to.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.047
I want to! How did you do it?

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.851
- I already told you, I don't know...
- No, tell me!

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:29.447
- You tell me!
- I changed my...

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.251
I had myself flayed.
Now that's enough!

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.048
Don't you dare move.

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.890
- What? No!
- It's okay...

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:46.088
Her, again!

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:48.050
Guards!

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:50.244
Guards!

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.924
- Guards!
- Calm down...

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.925
- Guards!
- She's no one, I can explain.

01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:58.049
- Who is she?
- She's a neighbor...

01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.044
She's behind. Get her out!

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:04.050
- Who is she?
- She won't do anything, please...

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.047
- Take her out!
- Please, don't hurt her...

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.647
What was she doing in my bedroom?
Out of my sight!

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.250
Out of my sight!

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.801
No... no...

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.850
I have to stay here, with my sister.

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:31.845
Master barber, I have
something to ask you.

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.241
Tell me.

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.928
Could you change my skin?

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.850
Flay me.

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:43.045
Why would you want to do that?

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:45.442
Because I want to be young again.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.650
My dear...

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.604
You will die.

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:54.003
I can pay you, my sister's a queen.

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.048
A queen?

01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.247
Well... then...

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.848
You go tell the queen

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:06.443
not to let you out on your own again.

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:11.050
Come on, go back home.

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.045
Sir...

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:32.645
Sir...

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.447
I have something to ask you.

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:42.047
- What?
- Can you change my skin?

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.448
- Change your skin?
- Flay me.

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:50.722
- Flay you?
- I can pay you.

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.850
My sister is the queen.

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:55.080
Sir...

01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:57.045
Help!

01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.242
Help me, please! Please!

01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:07.370
I'm being held prisoner by an ogre.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.847
You must have heard about me,
I'm a princess.

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.845
The king's daughter who was given
in marriage to an ogre.

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.447
I need you to help me
to get to the other side.

01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:19.045
Where is this ogre
that holds you prisoner?

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:21.044
He's hunting but he will back in.

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:24.045
I have to get across before he comes
back. You have to help me now.

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.048
How can I help you?

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:40.445
I'm sorry.

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:43.845
No! Please don't go!

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.847
I can't stay here!

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:52.042
Please, stay!

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:56.451
Please! Please!

01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:08.443
I have my sons,
they can save you.

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.682
But you have to wait until tomorrow.

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:13.890
No, I can't wait until tomorrow.

01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:16.805
Don't be afraid, trust me.
We'll come back tomorrow.

01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:21.409
No! Please, don't go!
Don't leave me, please!

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.767
Violet!

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:25.250
Mother!

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:54.650
<i>Your majesty!</i>

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:56.850
<i>Your majesty!</i>

01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:59.848
<i>Violet is here!</i>

01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:02.851
<i>The princess has returned!</i>

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:06.448
<i>Your Majesty! Violet is here.</i>

01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:11.048
Violet has come home to us.

01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:16.046
Come, sir, It would do
your heart good to see hen

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:18.282
Your Majesty, don't move.

01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:21.490
Please, Your Majesty...

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.491
You are too weak...

01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:34.645
Violet!

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:54.250
Here is the husband
that you chose for me.

01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:09.048
Forgive me.

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:12.250
Please, forgive me.

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.048
Violet...
