Amethyst, did you see?
I think that was my best one!

00:39.404 --> 00:43.574
Eh. You need to put more
"ball" in your cannon.

00:43.675 --> 00:45.743
Is that gonna hurt?

00:45.744 --> 00:49.429
Not if you do it like... this!

00:49.948 --> 00:54.786
That was awesome!
I want to jump in some more puddles.

00:54.787 --> 00:58.020
Okay. You can
try this one... or that one.

00:58.055 --> 01:01.560
- What about this one?
- Whoa, Steven! Wait!

01:06.130 --> 01:08.554
Only Garnet is allowed in there.

01:08.622 --> 01:13.170
Let's do something less dangerous.
Why don't you jump off that?

01:13.205 --> 01:16.829
Whoa. How do you
even stack your stuff that high?

01:16.897 --> 01:20.559
It's a talent.

01:26.473 --> 01:27.982
<i>Do it!</i>

01:27.983 --> 01:32.512
Amethyst, I hope you're
ready, 'cause here I...

01:32.579 --> 01:34.113
g-o-o-o...

01:40.667 --> 01:44.357
Huh?
Am I in Pearl's room?

01:44.424 --> 01:48.594
Ha!
That was crazy! Huh?

01:51.332 --> 01:55.813
- What is she doing with a Rose Quartz bubble?
- My mom bubbled that?

01:55.814 --> 02:01.607
Garnet's gonna be so ma...

02:05.291 --> 02:08.906
Ah. Hmm. Hmm?
Mm...

02:10.418 --> 02:13.579
- Busted!
- What are you doing in here?!

02:13.614 --> 02:15.513
What are you doing in here?!

02:15.581 --> 02:19.784
I... just wanted to see how the
shards are reacting to Rose's bubble.

02:19.885 --> 02:23.955
- And it's none of your business.
- I think it's Garnet's business.

02:24.056 --> 02:28.720
- Ohhhh!
- Don't tell her.

02:28.755 --> 02:33.965
- How are you gonna stop me?
- Amethyst!

02:34.032 --> 02:38.169
- Guys, stop fighting!
- Heathen!

02:38.270 --> 02:42.805
- Here. Let's just put it back...
- Steven, be careful with that!

02:42.840 --> 02:45.943
Yeah, give it to me!

02:54.953 --> 02:58.222
- We got to get Garnet.
- No! No way!

02:58.323 --> 03:02.270
We just freed a bunch of
mindless gem chunks, okay?!

03:02.305 --> 03:04.840
They're gonna crawl who knows
where, all over the temple!

03:04.875 --> 03:09.471
- When Garnet finds out, we're dead!
- She's not going to find out.

03:09.506 --> 03:11.785
We're going to catch them ...
all of them.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.443
You're right.
Every single one.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.567
Back and bubble
and back in the basement!

03:16.635 --> 03:20.185
- Like nothing ever happened.
- And then we tell Garnet?

03:20.220 --> 03:22.748
- No!
- This has to stay a secret.

03:22.783 --> 03:25.807
- Okay?
- Our secret... together?

03:25.842 --> 03:27.678
If we've got a secret, we have

03:27.746 --> 03:29.931
to do this right, which
means we got to come

03:29.932 --> 03:32.116
up with a name for our
secret-keeping team ...

03:32.217 --> 03:37.722
something cool, like... the Secret team!

03:37.790 --> 03:40.725
And a Secret team needs membership cards

03:40.726 --> 03:43.336
that we can show off to other people!

03:43.729 --> 03:47.083
- Here.
- Fish-stew pizza?

03:47.118 --> 03:50.121
Eh, what's a "V.I.Pizza"?

03:50.156 --> 03:53.163
Well, if you collect enough of
them, you can get a free pizza.

03:53.198 --> 03:58.330
But now they're the official
card of... the Secret team!

03:59.160 --> 04:03.797
Great, Steven.
Come on. We're doing this.

04:03.832 --> 04:07.023
- Hm!
- Secret team, move out!

04:51.363 --> 04:54.799
- Okay.
- That looks like all of them.

04:54.867 --> 05:00.231
- Yeah! Secret team!
- Hmm. Are you sure we didn't miss any?

05:00.266 --> 05:03.307
- No way! We totally nailed this.
- Yeah!

05:03.375 --> 05:07.211
If you're sure this is all
of them, then we just need

05:07.279 --> 05:11.149
- to seal it in a Rose-Quartz bubble.
- Steven, this is all you!

05:11.216 --> 05:14.352
- Think you can handle it?
- Yeah. I can do it.

05:14.353 --> 05:18.039
Of course you can!
You're part of the secret club.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.091
- Secret "team."
- Ah, yes.

05:20.159 --> 05:23.227
- Secret team.
- Yeah, that thing.

05:32.437 --> 05:35.946
- G-Garnet!
- Did she see you?

05:35.981 --> 05:39.143
- I don't think so.
- Then what are you waiting for?

05:43.448 --> 05:48.352
- Mission accomplished. Congratulations, us.
- Aww, yes.

05:48.420 --> 05:52.390
- We're off the hook.
- All right! So, what's next?

05:52.457 --> 05:56.038
Nothing's "next."
The mission is over.

05:56.073 --> 05:58.669
Now everything
goes back to normal, and we never

05:58.704 --> 06:03.495
- speak of this again.
- But what about... Secret team?

06:04.719 --> 06:07.004
Hey, Steven! What'll it be?

06:07.072 --> 06:09.941
Give me... the bits.

06:16.481 --> 06:18.903
We were the best, Fryman.

06:18.938 --> 06:21.219
- Who was the best?
- I can't tell you!

06:21.286 --> 06:24.989
How come the best thing's
in life are things you can't tell

06:25.057 --> 06:28.099
other people because
you'd get in big trouble?

06:28.100 --> 06:30.127
Steven, are you in a gang?

06:30.195 --> 06:34.443
Not these days.
But maybe I can be again.

06:36.301 --> 06:40.764
- That kid keeps getting weirder.
- I like your hat!

06:41.039 --> 06:44.308
I know you must be wondering
why I brought you all here.

06:44.376 --> 06:47.978
It's 'cause I'm gettin'
the team back together!

06:47.979 --> 06:49.780
So, here's the gig.

06:49.848 --> 06:54.418
- I left my special hat at the big donut.
- I've never seen you wear this.

06:54.453 --> 06:55.953
But now it's closed for the day.

06:56.021 --> 07:00.072
So the mission is, we
break in and get it back.

07:00.249 --> 07:04.442
And bam!
The Secret team is back on top!

07:04.443 --> 07:07.959
- Steven, Secret team is over.
- Secret team?

07:08.060 --> 07:11.529
- Wh-what's that?!
- Aw, come on!

07:11.597 --> 07:13.765
We had so much fun together!

07:13.766 --> 07:15.933
Getting along, sneaking around ...

07:16.001 --> 07:19.871
Steven, that was not about fun.
That was about fixing

07:19.938 --> 07:22.874
- our terrible mistake.
- Uh, your terrible mistake.

07:22.941 --> 07:25.476
You shouldn't have had that
bubble in the first place.

07:25.477 --> 07:26.744
It never would've popped

07:26.845 --> 07:30.848
- if you hadn't invaded my personal space!
- Aw, come on.

07:30.916 --> 07:34.519
- Team, team!
- Fine. You can have all the personal

07:34.586 --> 07:41.192
space you want, 'cause I never want
to be on a team with you again!

07:42.495 --> 07:44.962
Good! I don't
want to be on a team

07:45.064 --> 07:49.613
- with you, either!
- Fine!

07:49.715 --> 07:52.169
- Fine!
- Guys! Come on!

07:56.509 --> 07:58.697
I'm here.

07:59.098 --> 08:02.980
I have something
I want to tell you.

08:08.253 --> 08:13.524
- Pizza.
- No! I... need to come clean.

08:13.592 --> 08:15.376
Pearl and Amethyst popped a bubble.

08:15.377 --> 08:17.161
We made a Secret team to cover it up

08:17.229 --> 08:20.998
- 'cause they didn't want you to know.
- And now you're trying

08:21.066 --> 08:24.435
- to do the right thing.
- Not really. I just want Secret team again.

08:24.503 --> 08:28.039
I see. I know how
to handle things with them.

08:28.107 --> 08:31.876
We'll have to form our own
Secret team to do it.

08:31.944 --> 08:36.313
- You mean like... a Super Secret team?
- Pizza daughter.

08:36.381 --> 08:38.633
I'll take one "pizza posse" card.

08:39.898 --> 08:41.909
Garnet!

08:41.945 --> 08:45.728
- What's the deal?
- Steven!

08:45.763 --> 08:51.359
- What's this all about, Garnet?
- I know all about the... gem shot.

08:51.427 --> 08:55.362
- Uh...
- It ... it was me!

08:55.397 --> 08:58.099
I'm the one who popped the bubble!

08:58.134 --> 09:03.983
- All by myself.
- Steven... I can't believe you!

09:03.984 --> 09:08.539
If no one has anything else to say,

09:08.574 --> 09:10.627
and everyone else is innocent,

09:10.628 --> 09:13.708
Steven, I'm going to have to punish you.

09:13.743 --> 09:17.986
No! Not punishment!

09:18.054 --> 09:22.919
- Come with me, Steven.
- Garnet!

09:25.790 --> 09:28.396
Oh, no!
We must have missed a shard!

09:36.539 --> 09:40.608
- Amethyst!
- Wah!

09:45.581 --> 09:49.184
Huh?

09:49.251 --> 09:53.388
Pearl!

09:55.125 --> 09:59.270
Amethyst, shape-shift!
Get small or... something!

09:59.305 --> 10:02.076
I can't!
I'm freaking out! You do it!

10:02.111 --> 10:07.050
I can't concentra...
This is all my fault!

10:07.085 --> 10:10.004
- I never should have had that bubble!
- It wouldn't have

10:10.072 --> 10:13.208
- popped if it wasn't for me!
- We should've told Garnet!

10:13.275 --> 10:14.843
We should've told her right away!

10:14.844 --> 10:16.411
I knew Secret team was wrong!

10:16.512 --> 10:20.715
I just ... I wanted to see
you guys acting like friends!

10:20.783 --> 10:24.348
Garnet?

10:28.908 --> 10:30.859
What?

10:30.860 --> 10:33.161
- Huh?
- So, you two can't get along

10:33.229 --> 10:36.096
unless you think I'm going to kill you.

10:37.625 --> 10:40.304
Steven, I know you wanted to help them.

10:40.339 --> 10:43.004
You wanted to
protect them, even from me.

10:43.072 --> 10:47.675
They made you feel like you had to take
their side. But there are no sides,

10:47.743 --> 10:52.981
because we're all on the same
team ... the Crystal Gems!

11:02.525 --> 11:06.324
You know what?
Between the four of us...

11:06.375 --> 11:09.113
we could've had a free pizza.
