WEBVTT

00:03.770 --> 00:05.304
She's texting me again, bro.

00:05.357 --> 00:06.839
- Who?
- Angie.

00:06.905 --> 00:07.857
Will you see her again?

00:07.937 --> 00:09.683
Nah, man.
I have to shut that down.

00:09.749 --> 00:11.865
You've been singing the blues
about this woman for months.

00:11.971 --> 00:14.087
She reaches her hand out,
and you're gonna slap it away?

00:14.180 --> 00:15.701
Yeah, well,
she broke my heart, man.

00:15.822 --> 00:18.823
Hey,
which means she deserves another shot.

00:18.859 --> 00:19.858
Trust me.

00:19.893 --> 00:21.659
I know... 14 years and counting.

00:24.898 --> 00:25.864
You're right.

00:25.899 --> 00:26.664
I'll give her a call.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.166
Nice.

00:33.974 --> 00:35.817
I'm gonna go get the rest of the bags.

00:42.649 --> 00:44.048
Whoo!

00:44.084 --> 00:45.250
That wasn't me.

00:45.285 --> 00:47.519
Says the guy with the
razor-sharp French toast

00:47.554 --> 00:48.820
and the sausage kabob.

00:48.855 --> 00:51.356
Okay, that was me,
but that balloon had it coming.

00:51.391 --> 00:55.460
To you, my love, my heart, my bride.

00:55.495 --> 00:57.128
Welcome back to our home.

00:57.164 --> 00:59.831
Oh, that is so sweet, Castle.

00:59.866 --> 01:01.299
But how is this really a welcome back

01:01.334 --> 01:03.368
if I've been sneaking into
your room almost every night?

01:03.403 --> 01:05.737
Well, because you officially
moved all your stuff back in.

01:05.772 --> 01:08.239
Now that we've agreed
to hunt LokSat together,

01:08.275 --> 01:10.875
we can simply pick up
exactly where we left off.

01:10.911 --> 01:13.611
And as I recall,
we left off this morning somewhere

01:13.647 --> 01:15.313
right about here.

01:18.692 --> 01:20.081
Lucy, music off!

01:20.187 --> 01:21.686
As you wish, Rick.

01:21.721 --> 01:22.954
What just happened?

01:22.989 --> 01:25.223
Well, I've integrated Lucy into
all the loft's infrastructure.

01:25.258 --> 01:27.926
Climate, lights, music...
You name it, she controls it.

01:27.961 --> 01:29.527
Just got to work out a few kinks.

01:29.563 --> 01:31.563
Well, I still like a few
things the old-fashioned way,

01:31.598 --> 01:33.331
so do you want me to
make you a cup of coffee?

01:34.568 --> 01:36.501
Uh, no need, Kate.

01:36.536 --> 01:38.369
I've programmed Rick's coffee
exactly to his liking...

01:38.405 --> 01:41.472
Cuban blend, steamed milk,
two sugars, pinch of nutmeg.

01:41.508 --> 01:42.607
Amazing, huh?

01:42.642 --> 01:44.142
- Oh.
- No, Rick, you're amazing.

01:44.177 --> 01:45.443
No, you are.

01:45.478 --> 01:47.645
- No, you are.
- No, Lucy, you are.

01:47.681 --> 01:49.480
- Rick, you are amazing, and you know it.
- Beckett.

01:49.516 --> 01:51.282
Stop it.
I'm not doing this with you again.

01:51.318 --> 01:53.351
- You stop it.
- Yeah. Got it.

01:54.721 --> 01:56.421
We have a homicide.

01:56.456 --> 02:00.792
You, me, and a crime scene...
Just as nature intended.

02:00.827 --> 02:02.126
All right, Captain, let's roll.

02:02.162 --> 02:02.994
Yeah, no can do.

02:03.029 --> 02:04.362
Captains have to multitask.

02:04.397 --> 02:06.197
In fact,
I am due for a meeting with the D.A.

02:06.233 --> 02:07.665
So why don't you meet up with the boys?

02:07.701 --> 02:09.366
We can debrief later.

02:09.401 --> 02:10.735
You got it.

02:15.508 --> 02:19.244
Um, Lucy, do you think you
could make me a cup of coffee...

02:19.279 --> 02:21.212
Splash of low-fat milk, two Splendas?

02:21.248 --> 02:23.081
No can do. All out of Splenda.

02:23.116 --> 02:25.617
But there is a Starbucks
two blocks from here.

02:25.652 --> 02:26.885
Would you like directions?

02:26.920 --> 02:28.620
No. Thanks.

02:28.655 --> 02:29.621
I know where it is.

02:29.656 --> 02:31.322
Great. Have fun. Goodbye.

02:31.358 --> 02:32.924
Leave the house.

02:32.959 --> 02:35.159
Lanie, look who's here.

02:35.195 --> 02:39.264
Castle! So happy you
and Beckett are back together.

02:39.332 --> 02:42.133
Now do us all a favor and don't
mess things up with her again.

02:42.168 --> 02:43.868
Why do you assume it was my fault?

02:43.904 --> 02:45.236
Everything is your fault.

02:45.272 --> 02:49.140
Now come meet our new victim...
Michael Kirby, single GSW.

02:49.175 --> 02:52.477
Our thief/killer rappelled
from that A/C duct.

02:52.512 --> 02:54.913
And they got away with $100,000 in cash.

02:54.948 --> 02:56.514
This is Darren Ives.

02:56.549 --> 02:58.349
He was inside when he heard the shot.

02:58.385 --> 03:00.051
Rushed out,
but the killer was already gone.

03:00.086 --> 03:01.352
I don't know how that guy did it.

03:01.388 --> 03:02.887
I mean,
this is a high-security warehouse.

03:02.923 --> 03:03.955
It's damn near Fort Knox.

03:03.990 --> 03:05.723
And you didn't see anything suspicious?

03:05.792 --> 03:08.426
Nothing. It was just a normal drop.

03:08.461 --> 03:10.461
Let's finish taking your
statement over here, please.

03:12.299 --> 03:13.564
What? Are your allergies acting up?

03:15.969 --> 03:17.201
What is this... gelatin?

03:17.237 --> 03:20.104
It smells like ladies perfume.

03:20.140 --> 03:21.973
What is that scent?
Is that White Diamonds?

03:22.008 --> 03:23.942
No. Chanel No. 5.

03:25.011 --> 03:26.210
Ah.

03:26.246 --> 03:27.779
One Direction body spray. Nailed it.

03:29.883 --> 03:31.849
This stuff dripped from the A/C vent.

03:31.885 --> 03:32.884
CSU took samples...

03:32.919 --> 03:34.953
It's from the alarm sensors in the vent.

03:34.988 --> 03:39.023
Apparently, the killer used it
to disable the security system.

03:40.193 --> 03:42.660
Lanie, can you ask the
lab to put a rush on this?

03:42.696 --> 03:43.628
Why? What is it?

03:43.663 --> 03:45.663
I've seen this M.O. before.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.666
It was like 10 years ago.

03:48.702 --> 03:50.601
So, when you worked with the 54th?

03:50.637 --> 03:51.869
Yeah. I collared a thief.

03:51.905 --> 03:54.439
Her name was, uh, Sonia Ruiz.

03:54.474 --> 03:55.506
She was part of a crew

03:55.542 --> 03:57.075
that stole $10 million
worth of gold coins

03:57.110 --> 03:58.209
from some auction house.

03:58.244 --> 03:59.877
And they used a fragrant gel, too?

03:59.913 --> 04:03.014
It was actually a unique blend
of Jell-O and ladies perfume.

04:03.049 --> 04:05.984
You're saying a kid's dessert
mixed with eau de toilette

04:06.019 --> 04:08.219
can foil a sophisticated
security system?

04:08.254 --> 04:10.054
I'm telling you, we need a dog.

04:10.090 --> 04:11.522
Does that formula even work?

04:11.558 --> 04:13.725
Yeah.
Someone in the crew came up with it.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.827
The gelatin blocks the security lasers,

04:15.862 --> 04:17.661
and the phthalates in the perfume

04:17.697 --> 04:19.964
create an even distribution
over the sensors.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.235
But the mix has to be exact...
80% Jell-O, 20% perfume.

04:24.270 --> 04:25.603
Which is the precise ratio

04:25.638 --> 04:27.739
of the gelatin found at our crime scene.

04:27.774 --> 04:29.607
Lab sent over the analysis report.

04:29.642 --> 04:32.276
Identical to the heist
from nine years ago,

04:32.312 --> 04:36.147
where the only perp
captured was Sonia Ruiz.

04:36.182 --> 04:37.215
Yep. That's her.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.783
So, obviously,
this wasn't a coincidence.

04:38.818 --> 04:40.118
Most likely, someone from the crew

04:40.186 --> 04:42.153
reused the technique and is
behind our victim's murder.

04:42.188 --> 04:43.554
Well, it couldn't have been Sonia.

04:43.590 --> 04:44.589
She got 15 years.

04:44.624 --> 04:45.890
And what about the rest of the crew?

04:45.925 --> 04:47.425
Nah, she didn't give up any names.

04:47.460 --> 04:49.327
The rumor was that the
crew was put together

04:49.362 --> 04:51.295
by some mysterious shot-caller...

04:51.331 --> 04:53.598
Goes by the street name of
"Great White."

04:53.633 --> 04:55.700
Is it possible to trace them
through the stolen gold coins?

04:55.735 --> 04:57.769
I mean, they had to have tried
to sell them at some point.

04:57.804 --> 04:59.604
There hasn't been any trace
of them since the heist.

04:59.639 --> 05:00.772
Well, that makes sense.

05:00.807 --> 05:02.874
If they melted the
coins down for the gold,

05:02.909 --> 05:04.776
that would render the coins untraceable.

05:04.811 --> 05:06.811
Espo, why don't we pay
Sonia Ruiz a little visit?

05:06.846 --> 05:08.613
She might not have turned
on her crew back in the day,

05:08.648 --> 05:09.914
but after nine years hard time,

05:09.949 --> 05:11.582
we might be able to persuade her.

05:11.618 --> 05:13.051
You know what? From what I remember,

05:13.086 --> 05:14.519
she may be the type to hold a grudge,

05:14.554 --> 05:17.088
so you might have better
luck taking Castle with you.

05:17.123 --> 05:19.590
Oh, no,
not falling for that trick again.

05:19.626 --> 05:21.859
Contrary to what you
three led me to believe,

05:21.895 --> 05:23.761
those women's prisons are nothing like

05:23.797 --> 05:26.364
the late-night Skinemax movies,
so have fun.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:36.042 --> 05:38.309
All right, Ms. Ruiz,
tell me what you know.

05:38.344 --> 05:39.710
Please. I didn't snitch back in the day.

05:39.746 --> 05:40.812
Why would I start now?

05:40.847 --> 05:42.880
Because nine years ago,
this was just a burglary,

05:42.916 --> 05:43.848
and now it's a murder.

05:43.883 --> 05:45.149
Murder?

05:45.185 --> 05:45.983
Who died?

05:46.019 --> 05:47.285
An armored truck driver.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.921
Look, Sonia, you help me out,
I'll help you out.

05:49.956 --> 05:50.922
With what?

05:50.957 --> 05:52.490
I'm up for parole in three months,

05:52.525 --> 05:54.659
and due to overcrowding,
I'm a lock to get out.

05:54.694 --> 05:56.094
Not if I go to your parole hearing

05:56.129 --> 06:01.032
and testify that you refused to
cooperate in solving a homicide.

06:01.067 --> 06:01.966
It's like that?

06:02.001 --> 06:03.601
I've got an innocent man in the morgue

06:03.636 --> 06:05.336
who left behind a wife
and two small kids,

06:05.371 --> 06:06.838
so, yeah, it's like that.

06:06.873 --> 06:08.773
I couldn't help you even if I wanted to.

06:08.808 --> 06:10.675
The gold coin heist Great White set up

06:10.710 --> 06:12.677
was a two-person job,

06:12.712 --> 06:14.245
but I don't know my partner's name.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.213
That doesn't make any sense.

06:15.248 --> 06:16.380
And yet it's true.

06:16.416 --> 06:18.950
He didn't know my name,
and I didn't know his.

06:18.985 --> 06:21.419
So neither one of us
could rat out the other.

06:21.454 --> 06:24.822
We used shark names.
I was Mako. He was Hammerhead.

06:24.858 --> 06:26.591
All right.
What can you tell me about Great White?

06:26.659 --> 06:29.527
Now, his name I knew... Jimmy Sanchez.

06:29.562 --> 06:31.596
He was the neighborhood
shot-caller back in the day.

06:31.631 --> 06:33.331
Okay, so, where can I find him?

06:33.366 --> 06:34.866
In the cemetery.

06:34.901 --> 06:37.635
He died a little over three years ago.

06:37.670 --> 06:38.903
Wait, if Great White is dead,

06:38.938 --> 06:40.771
then Hammerhead's most
likely our killer.

06:40.807 --> 06:43.341
Hey, that Jell-O perfume
formula was his invention,

06:43.376 --> 06:44.375
so it has to be.

06:44.410 --> 06:46.110
W-What do you remember about Hammerhead?

06:46.146 --> 06:47.879
Um...

06:47.914 --> 06:49.647
Anything at all.

06:49.682 --> 06:52.350
Once let it slip that
he met Jimmy Sanchez

06:52.385 --> 06:55.419
at a bar called, um, El Toro.

06:55.455 --> 06:57.722
Good. I'll have my detectives
head off over there.

06:57.757 --> 06:59.757
Good luck with that, lady.

06:59.792 --> 07:01.292
It's up in Spanish Harlem.

07:01.327 --> 07:03.427
No one there talks to the police.

07:03.463 --> 07:07.098
However, they will talk to me.

07:07.133 --> 07:09.167
You want me to put you on the street?

07:10.236 --> 07:11.235
No.

07:11.271 --> 07:13.604
Hey, you're hanging parole over my head.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.607
You want Hammerhead,
this is how you get him.

07:18.111 --> 07:20.478
The Department of Corrections
authorized her furlough?

07:20.513 --> 07:23.147
Yeah. Right now,
Sonia is our best and only path

07:23.183 --> 07:24.482
to Hammerhead's real identity.

07:24.517 --> 07:25.750
So, what's the plan?

07:25.785 --> 07:28.920
You and Espo are gonna
head over to the...

07:30.190 --> 07:31.422
Excuse me.

07:31.457 --> 07:32.290
What's going on?

07:32.325 --> 07:33.591
What are you not telling me?

07:35.461 --> 07:37.495
So, funny story, really, uh...

07:37.530 --> 07:38.663
What?

07:38.698 --> 07:41.899
Sonia and I were, uh,
we were kind of involved.

07:41.935 --> 07:43.234
Involved like dating?

07:43.269 --> 07:44.068
Dating? No.

07:44.103 --> 07:45.136
Come on. Dating.

07:45.171 --> 07:47.438
We... We were more like engaged.

07:47.473 --> 07:48.773
Engaged?! You were...

07:48.808 --> 07:50.675
Wait a second.
All these years you never told me that?

07:50.710 --> 07:52.109
You never asked.

07:52.145 --> 07:53.711
You're a cop. How could you
get involved with a criminal?

07:53.746 --> 07:57.248
Well, technically,
they were in the same line of work.

07:57.283 --> 07:59.083
So, really, it's a workplace romance.

07:59.118 --> 08:00.318
Thank you.

08:00.353 --> 08:02.053
I didn't know she was a crook at first,
okay?

08:02.088 --> 08:05.089
I-I met her at a club.
She seemed normal.

08:05.124 --> 08:07.658
We just... We just clicked.

08:07.694 --> 08:10.394
And it's probably why she hid
who she really was from me.

08:10.430 --> 08:12.396
A-And when did you find out the truth?

08:12.432 --> 08:13.731
After it was too late!

08:13.766 --> 08:16.500
We were engaged,
and then she started acting strange...

08:16.536 --> 08:17.768
Disappearing at odd hours,

08:17.804 --> 08:19.770
and then she couldn't
look me in the eye.

08:19.806 --> 08:21.806
And then news of that
gold coin heist broke,

08:21.841 --> 08:23.808
and I... I don't know.

08:23.843 --> 08:25.543
I knew.

08:25.578 --> 08:28.346
And I was the one who arrested her.

08:28.381 --> 08:30.081
So, did you ask for the ring back,

08:30.116 --> 08:31.716
or did you let her keep
that so she could trade it

08:31.751 --> 08:33.116
for cigarettes in the prison yard?

08:33.152 --> 08:34.885
That's... Don't answer that.

08:34.921 --> 08:37.188
Okay. So, obviously,
you're sitting this one out.

08:37.222 --> 08:39.357
Whoa, whoa, ho-whoa.
Why are you benching me?

08:40.493 --> 08:42.525
Okay. I get it. But there's no need.

08:42.562 --> 08:44.362
Any feelings I had for her

08:44.397 --> 08:47.231
died the moment I
slapped those cuffs on.

08:47.267 --> 08:49.734
Trust me, I am over her completely.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.412
Javier?

09:08.655 --> 09:10.955
You sure you're over her?

09:10.990 --> 09:13.791
You might want to tell your mouth.
Close that up.

09:17.589 --> 09:19.719
S08E16
Heartbreaker

09:19.811 --> 09:22.523
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

09:30.311 --> 09:31.511
She's gorgeous.

09:31.546 --> 09:32.578
She a'ight.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.613
Are you all right?

09:33.648 --> 09:35.414
I mean, you seemed a little taken aback

09:35.450 --> 09:36.482
when you first saw her.

09:36.518 --> 09:37.717
Nah, man.

09:37.752 --> 09:39.785
It's just, um...
It's just a little déjÃ  vu.

09:39.821 --> 09:42.892
She's literally wearing the
same outfit I arrested her in.

09:43.058 --> 09:45.458
Nine years later, still a great dress.

09:45.493 --> 09:46.793
It was a Friday night.

09:46.828 --> 09:48.661
What's that?

09:48.697 --> 09:50.330
It was a Friday night.

09:50.365 --> 09:51.998
We went salsa dancing on Friday nights.

09:52.033 --> 09:54.701
You know, Javier,
there's no shame in admitting

09:54.736 --> 09:56.235
if you still have feelings.

09:56.271 --> 09:59.906
I know, but I don't.

09:59.941 --> 10:03.876
She's just another convict...
Nothing else.

10:03.912 --> 10:06.746
This ankle
monitor is a next-generation device

10:06.781 --> 10:08.147
with a variety of new tracking features.

10:08.183 --> 10:09.515
This is the instruction manual.

10:09.551 --> 10:11.517
Now, I could walk you through
some of the features...

10:11.553 --> 10:13.186
What does he have to do with this?

10:13.221 --> 10:15.855
Uh, Detective Ryan's gonna
accompany you to the bar he's...

10:15.890 --> 10:17.190
What? Him? Hell, no.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.092
Take me back to prison.
This is not gonna work.

10:19.127 --> 10:20.626
Wait, I-I'm sorry. What's the problem?

10:20.662 --> 10:22.695
You're gonna send me
into a Spanish Harlem bar

10:22.731 --> 10:23.763
with Saint Paddy on my arm.

10:23.798 --> 10:25.631
Sweetheart, I used to work undercover.

10:25.667 --> 10:26.866
I can take care of myself.

10:26.901 --> 10:28.501
Look, the only way this is gonna work

10:28.536 --> 10:32.205
is if I go in with
somebody who can blend in.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.406
Someone like Javi.

10:36.611 --> 10:39.746
For the umpteenth time, Beckett, I...
I can handle this.

10:39.781 --> 10:40.947
Really? Because if it was me,

10:40.982 --> 10:42.382
I don't think I would be that confident.

10:42.417 --> 10:44.283
Is it awkward? Of course.

10:44.319 --> 10:46.152
But it's the only way we're
gonna solve this murder.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.855
Castle and Ryan are gonna be
backing me up in a follow car.

10:48.890 --> 10:50.590
What's the worst that could happen?

10:50.625 --> 10:51.791
I don't know.

10:51.826 --> 10:53.526
And that's what makes me nervous.

10:53.561 --> 10:56.162
Kate, I am not gonna let you down.

10:59.234 --> 11:00.967
All right. Listen up, Sonia.

11:01.002 --> 11:03.503
You do what I say when I say it,
understand?

11:03.538 --> 11:06.005
Nice to see you too, sweetie.

11:07.909 --> 11:10.043
This is not a...
This is not a joke, okay?

11:10.078 --> 11:11.511
When I say "jump," you say...

11:11.546 --> 11:12.712
That you're out of your damn mind

11:12.747 --> 11:14.313
if you think I'm jumping in these heels,
okay?

11:14.349 --> 11:15.815
And speaking of, I need new clothes

11:15.850 --> 11:19.185
'cause this outfit is
damn near 10 years old.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.954
And I got a rep to protect,
so I need labels.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.856
Fine, whatever. Let's just
hurry up and get this over with.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.191
Didn't I used to say that to you

11:25.226 --> 11:26.559
whenever you got frisky at night?

11:30.398 --> 11:31.164
Let's go.

11:36.704 --> 11:40.473
This is gonna be so much fun.

11:41.443 --> 11:42.475
Can you please speed up?

11:42.510 --> 11:43.910
You know,
my prison term is gonna be over

11:43.945 --> 11:44.777
by the time we get there.

11:44.813 --> 11:45.711
I'm going the speed limit.

11:45.747 --> 11:46.946
Oh, good.

11:46.981 --> 11:48.881
You know, I don't want you
to get pulled over by a cop.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.349
Come on! Hurry up!

11:50.418 --> 11:53.052
I think we better slow
down a little bit.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.520
There we go.

11:54.556 --> 11:55.555
That's much better.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.992
I still can't believe Javi
was engaged to that woman.

12:00.028 --> 12:01.461
Oh, I can.

12:01.529 --> 12:03.329
I mean, you see the
electricity between those two?

12:03.364 --> 12:04.330
It crackles.

12:04.365 --> 12:05.331
Yeah, that might be a problem.

12:05.366 --> 12:06.499
We need to keep an eye on her.

12:06.534 --> 12:08.734
Well, actually,
I think we can do more than that.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.337
There a listening device built
in to Sonia's ankle monitor.

12:11.372 --> 12:12.705
- A hidden mike?
- Yeah.

12:12.740 --> 12:14.474
All we have to do is enter the
security number into the app...

12:14.509 --> 12:15.741
We can hear everything they're saying.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.276
But they wouldn't know
that we were listening.

12:17.312 --> 12:18.778
That would be an invasion
of their privacy.

12:18.813 --> 12:19.812
You got a problem with that?

12:19.848 --> 12:21.781
No! No.

12:21.816 --> 12:23.282
You know, I'm glad

12:23.318 --> 12:25.284
you didn't get fat over all that guilt.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.352
What guilt?

12:26.387 --> 12:27.987
For turning me in.

12:28.022 --> 12:31.057
Why would I feel guilty
about doing my job?

12:31.092 --> 12:32.458
Because you love me.

12:33.428 --> 12:34.760
Loved you.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.663
Past tense... way past.

12:37.699 --> 12:40.633
Done. Finished. Terminado.

12:40.668 --> 12:43.803
You know,
I was meaning to say thank you.

12:43.838 --> 12:44.704
For what?

12:44.739 --> 12:46.305
For arresting me.

12:46.341 --> 12:49.609
You saved me the misery of
spending another day with you.

12:50.578 --> 12:51.711
That's harsh.

12:51.746 --> 12:53.279
How's your abuelita's hip?

12:53.314 --> 12:55.481
Good. She finally got it replaced.

12:55.517 --> 12:56.616
Oh, good.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.018
She was always so sweet.

12:59.053 --> 13:00.786
Your whole family was.

13:02.457 --> 13:04.690
That's what haunts me, you know...

13:04.726 --> 13:09.128
Thinking how they must have
reacted when they learned

13:09.164 --> 13:11.597
I was nothing more than a crook.

13:21.276 --> 13:23.609
If Great White met Hammerhead here,

13:23.645 --> 13:26.212
stands to reason that somebody
knows his real identity.

13:26.247 --> 13:28.080
Yeah, but that was nine years ago.

13:28.116 --> 13:30.516
Where do we start?

13:32.020 --> 13:33.119
The bartender.

13:33.154 --> 13:35.254
He's bound to know where
the old timers are.

13:35.290 --> 13:36.589
Yeah?

13:36.624 --> 13:37.957
Yeah.

13:37.992 --> 13:40.293
Let me do the talking.

13:40.328 --> 13:42.562
What's going on, guys?
What can I get for you?

13:42.597 --> 13:44.597
Uh, shot of tequila, double rows.

13:44.632 --> 13:45.665
- What?
- Hmm.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.333
Double rows coming up.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.201
Thank you, baby.

13:48.236 --> 13:49.268
What is she doing?

13:49.304 --> 13:51.070
She's blending in to her environment.

13:51.105 --> 13:52.605
It's actually a brilliant strategy.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.240
Either that or getting Javier drunk.

13:54.275 --> 13:55.241
Why would she want to do that?

13:55.276 --> 13:57.710
Exactly. Exactly.

13:57.745 --> 13:58.744
Ding ding.

13:58.780 --> 13:59.512
Aah!

13:59.547 --> 14:00.479
We got a winner.

14:00.515 --> 14:01.480
Set us up again.

14:01.516 --> 14:04.217
If you say so.

14:04.252 --> 14:05.851
Hey, bro,
how long you been bartending here?

14:05.887 --> 14:07.153
A little over 10 years.

14:07.188 --> 14:09.655
Oh, so then you remember
a guy named Jimmy Sanchez?

14:09.691 --> 14:11.123
Went by the name of, uh, Great White?

14:11.159 --> 14:12.263
- Right?
- Great White.

14:12.343 --> 14:13.057
Yeah, yeah. Why you ask?

14:13.127 --> 14:14.360
Did you ever see him with this,
you know,

14:14.395 --> 14:15.728
really good-looking kid
form the neighborhood...

14:15.763 --> 14:16.829
Short with a beard?

14:16.864 --> 14:17.730
No, sorry.

14:17.765 --> 14:19.065
Hey, it's all good.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.533
I just got out on parole, you know,

14:20.568 --> 14:22.168
from a little job I did back in the day,

14:22.203 --> 14:24.503
so if I could just find him...

14:24.539 --> 14:26.872
Look, señorita, I can't help you out.

14:31.479 --> 14:32.445
How 'bout now?

14:32.480 --> 14:33.806
What the hell are you doing, bro?

14:36.618 --> 14:38.684
Give me his name.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.721
Wait, does this sound like...

14:41.756 --> 14:43.155
It sounds like he's playing
"Five Finger Fillet"

14:43.191 --> 14:44.323
with the bartender, it certainly does.

14:45.693 --> 14:46.759
Don't tell Beckett.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.763
Ooh. My hand's getting twitchy, bro.

14:50.798 --> 14:52.265
You better tell me something.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.532
Okay.

14:53.568 --> 14:54.767
Look, it's J-Joey.

14:54.802 --> 14:55.968
All right? His name's Joey.

14:56.004 --> 14:56.902
Joey what?

14:56.938 --> 14:58.037
It beats the hell out of me, man.

14:58.072 --> 14:59.272
I haven't seen the guy in over a year.

14:59.307 --> 15:00.673
- That's all I know.
- I don't belive you.

15:04.512 --> 15:05.378
Stop!

15:06.681 --> 15:08.080
He's close his close
with his grandmother.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.282
She lives up the street.

15:09.317 --> 15:11.317
Third building, the brick one, 6D.

15:11.352 --> 15:13.286
She can tell you where he is.

15:13.321 --> 15:14.253
Thank you.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.521
Mm.

15:18.593 --> 15:20.393
6...

15:21.763 --> 15:23.462
6D.

15:23.498 --> 15:24.897
It's open.

15:29.337 --> 15:30.970
Hello?

15:35.576 --> 15:38.577
Castle.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.547
I lost the signal.

15:48.456 --> 15:50.589
You make a move, and I'll kill you.

15:50.625 --> 15:51.757
Hey!

15:56.441 --> 15:58.546
Who are you,
and why'd you break into my GG's house?

15:58.675 --> 15:59.807
- Put the gun down.
- Screw that.

15:59.843 --> 16:00.909
Normally I'd do this back
and forth thing with you,

16:00.944 --> 16:02.243
but I got to go chase her, so...

16:11.721 --> 16:12.553
Man...

16:12.588 --> 16:13.821
Don't go anywhere.

16:13.856 --> 16:15.489
Okay. Here we go.

16:15.525 --> 16:17.091
Just re-enter the serial number...

16:17.126 --> 16:18.559
...and voilÃ.

16:18.594 --> 16:20.795
They're my toes,
and I can pick them if I want.

16:20.830 --> 16:22.096
That's the wrong ankle monitor.

16:22.131 --> 16:23.798
- Ju...
- Must have transposed their number.

16:25.101 --> 16:26.100
Was that...?

16:26.135 --> 16:27.802
Damn it!

16:35.044 --> 16:36.877
Yeah, she's right there. I got her.

16:39.115 --> 16:40.014
Sonia! Stop!

16:40.850 --> 16:41.882
Javi, you okay?

16:41.918 --> 16:43.184
Yeah, I'm okay. What are you doing?

16:43.219 --> 16:44.185
There was a guy with a shotgun...

16:44.220 --> 16:45.352
Let me see your hands!

16:45.388 --> 16:46.453
What?

16:46.489 --> 16:48.189
What, you think I was trying to escape?

16:48.224 --> 16:49.957
I see a gun, and I run!

16:49.992 --> 16:51.692
I was trying to get to
a phone to call 911.

16:51.727 --> 16:52.993
Not buying it, sweetheart.

16:53.029 --> 16:55.162
Irish, I got three months
left on my sentence, okay?

16:55.198 --> 16:56.664
I already served nine long years.

16:56.699 --> 16:58.299
I run right now, they add another two.

16:58.334 --> 16:59.466
How dumb do you think I am?

16:59.502 --> 17:01.135
Don't answer that.
It's a trap, trust me.

17:01.170 --> 17:02.570
Do you think she's telling the truth?

17:02.605 --> 17:03.938
I don't know.

17:03.973 --> 17:05.772
It's not like she hasn't
lied to me before.

17:05.808 --> 17:06.740
Damn.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.008
I knew you weren't over me.

17:08.044 --> 17:10.611
I am so over you.

17:10.646 --> 17:12.813
Now, was that Hammerhead that
jumped me with the shotgun?

17:12.848 --> 17:13.781
Yeah.

17:13.816 --> 17:14.682
That was him.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.819
Look, I didn't know you were a cop, man.

17:19.856 --> 17:21.454
You broke into my GG's apartment,

17:21.490 --> 17:22.957
my shotgun is registered,

17:22.992 --> 17:25.459
and I have a right to
defend my property.

17:25.493 --> 17:26.861
So y'all got nothing to hold me on.

17:26.896 --> 17:28.462
You like sharks, Joey?

17:28.497 --> 17:30.297
Yeah. They're cool, I guess.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.599
What's your favorite shark?

17:31.634 --> 17:32.833
Oh, yeah, I like the ones with the, uh,

17:32.869 --> 17:33.801
with the funny shaped heads.

17:33.836 --> 17:34.935
You know what I'm talking about?

17:34.971 --> 17:35.836
Oh, yeah, the hammerheads.

17:35.872 --> 17:37.171
Yeah, that's... that's it.

17:37.206 --> 17:38.472
That's funny because, uh,

17:38.507 --> 17:41.208
we heard that you were Hammerhead.

17:41.244 --> 17:43.177
Yeah? Who told you that?

17:44.046 --> 17:45.846
Wait,
that girl that was with you earlier.

17:45.882 --> 17:47.147
I knew she looked familiar.

17:47.183 --> 17:50.184
Hammerheads aren't usually man-killers,
Joey.

17:50.219 --> 17:52.052
So, what happened?

17:52.088 --> 17:53.387
Oof.

17:53.422 --> 17:54.655
I don't know what you're talking about.

17:54.690 --> 17:56.457
10 years ago,
you were part of a heist crew

17:56.492 --> 17:58.525
that used gelatin mixed with perfume

17:58.561 --> 17:59.994
to disable security systems.

18:00.062 --> 18:02.429
Last night, you used the same recipe

18:02.465 --> 18:04.298
to break into a high-security warehouse.

18:04.333 --> 18:08.068
Only thing is,
you got caught and you murdered a guard.

18:08.104 --> 18:12.006
Last night, I was in Jersey
at my Chicken-Chicken-Chicken.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.440
It's a chicken restaurant.

18:13.476 --> 18:15.409
I own seven in the Tri-State area.

18:15.444 --> 18:17.044
Let me guess... You bought those

18:17.079 --> 18:18.679
with your share of the gold coin heist?

18:18.714 --> 18:21.982
Even if I did,
statute of limitations is over.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.618
And I have a dozen witnesses that put me

18:24.654 --> 18:26.887
at the Chicken-Chicken-Chicken
until 3:00 a.m.

18:26.923 --> 18:28.889
So, you ain't gonna touch
me with that score either.

18:28.925 --> 18:30.791
That doesn't mean you
weren't a part of the heist.

18:30.826 --> 18:33.027
How else would they know
about the gelatin formula?

18:33.062 --> 18:35.496
Easy...
I ain't the only one who knew it.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.563
Great White?

18:36.599 --> 18:37.998
Jimmy Sanchez is dead.

18:38.034 --> 18:38.999
We confirmed that.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.935
Yeah, but he ran other crews.

18:40.970 --> 18:43.003
Ain't no telling how
many of them he told.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.572
Look, I'm a successful businessman now.

18:45.608 --> 18:49.076
All right?
Whatever criminal instincts I had...

18:49.111 --> 18:51.645
long gone.

18:51.681 --> 18:53.280
I'm all about the chicken now.

18:55.918 --> 18:57.851
Hey, Cap.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.787
Joey's alibi checks out.

18:59.822 --> 19:01.155
'Re pulling apart his financials,

19:01.190 --> 19:02.856
but it looks like he might
be telling the truth.

19:02.892 --> 19:06.393
Okay.
I got UNis taking Sonia back to prison.

19:06.429 --> 19:07.695
Are you okay?

19:07.730 --> 19:09.530
Yeah, I'm just, uh, you know...

19:09.565 --> 19:11.198
I'm just bummed that it didn't work out.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.766
Not... Not between me and Sonia.

19:12.802 --> 19:13.934
I'm talking about the... the case.

19:13.970 --> 19:15.769
Ryan! You got something?

19:15.805 --> 19:18.739
Yeah.
I think that crew used an inside man.

19:18.774 --> 19:20.274
What? What makes you think that?

19:20.309 --> 19:22.409
The security system at that
high-security warehouse

19:22.445 --> 19:24.411
is way more sophisticated
than the auction house

19:24.447 --> 19:25.946
where those gold coins were stolen.

19:25.982 --> 19:27.848
I mean,
they had an infrared camera system

19:27.917 --> 19:30.184
that some low-tech bypass
couldn't have knocked out.

19:30.219 --> 19:32.386
Yet it was down at the
time of the murder.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.588
So,
somebody on the inside did turn it off.

19:34.623 --> 19:37.057
Yes. Michael Kirby, our victim.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.625
His security code was the one used.

19:38.661 --> 19:40.461
But if he was in on it,
then why kill him?

19:40.496 --> 19:43.097
I don't know. But we could ask his wife.

19:45.334 --> 19:46.900
Hey, Captain, I'd like to, uh,

19:46.936 --> 19:49.003
volunteer to take Sonia
back to the prison.

19:49.038 --> 19:50.571
No. I don't think that's a good idea.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.640
Yeah, I know,
but it's the right thing to do.

19:56.212 --> 19:57.611
All right.

19:57.646 --> 19:59.046
You interview Kirby's wife.

19:59.081 --> 20:00.748
And I expect you back
first thing in the morning,

20:00.783 --> 20:01.582
ready to work.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.584
Yes, ma'am.

20:06.188 --> 20:07.354
He's gonna be fine.

20:09.158 --> 20:10.224
I'll take her, boys...

20:10.259 --> 20:12.393
Captain's orders.

20:12.428 --> 20:14.294
This is bull, Javi.
You know I can still help.

20:14.363 --> 20:16.096
I'm sorry. Joey was your only shot.

20:18.334 --> 20:19.900
This sucks.

20:19.935 --> 20:22.636
I thought I'd at least get...

20:22.671 --> 20:25.272
a decent meal, maybe a hot shower,

20:25.307 --> 20:26.807
sleep in a real bed.

20:26.842 --> 20:28.475
Well, in three months,
you'll get all that.

20:28.511 --> 20:29.777
You don't understand.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.179
Nine years, I've eaten prison food,

20:32.214 --> 20:34.515
slept on a six-inch piece of foam.

20:34.550 --> 20:38.118
Nine years, I've had to live on edge.

20:38.154 --> 20:41.989
And I thought I'd get, you know,
a little time to relax.

20:42.024 --> 20:44.058
Well, the drive is an hour.

20:44.093 --> 20:45.993
You can relax in the car.

20:47.863 --> 20:49.496
What am I doing here?

20:49.532 --> 20:50.764
I already gave my statement.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.567
Mrs. Kirby, we know about

20:53.602 --> 20:55.369
your husband's involvement in the heist.

20:55.404 --> 20:56.537
What?

20:56.572 --> 21:00.207
We found anonymous bank deposits

21:00.242 --> 21:03.477
totaling $10,000

21:03.512 --> 21:05.913
made to your joint account.

21:05.948 --> 21:08.015
We can charge you as an accessory.

21:13.222 --> 21:15.722
My husband was in trouble.

21:15.758 --> 21:18.125
He borrowed money from some bad people,

21:18.160 --> 21:20.227
and we couldn't pay it back.

21:20.262 --> 21:22.663
And then last week, a man came to him,

21:22.698 --> 21:24.531
and he said he could
make the debt go away

21:24.567 --> 21:25.833
if my husband would help him.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.734
What was this man's name?
What did he look like?

21:27.770 --> 21:29.736
I don't know. I never met him.

21:30.773 --> 21:32.639
All I know is that Michael communicated

21:32.675 --> 21:34.808
on a pre-paid cellphone
he kept in the garage.

21:34.844 --> 21:35.776
Is the phone still there?

21:35.811 --> 21:36.944
Yeah.

21:38.914 --> 21:41.014
What are we doing?

21:42.585 --> 21:43.884
This is your Mom's house.

21:43.919 --> 21:45.018
Yeah.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.154
It's Thursday, family dinner night.

21:47.189 --> 21:48.856
You're gonna have a home cooked meal,

21:48.891 --> 21:50.657
and then it's straight
back to the prison.

21:50.693 --> 21:53.894
I can't face your family, Javi,

21:53.929 --> 21:55.729
not after what they know about me.

21:55.764 --> 21:57.131
I didn't tell them anything.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.332
What?

21:58.367 --> 22:00.601
I told them that I was
the one that screwed up,

22:00.636 --> 22:02.336
that you broke up with me.

22:03.873 --> 22:05.401
You did that for me?

22:08.210 --> 22:10.065
Thank you.

22:21.457 --> 22:22.923
All right.

22:26.061 --> 22:27.261
Hello?

22:27.296 --> 22:29.229
Mijo, you're late!

22:29.265 --> 22:30.531
You know how I worry.

22:30.566 --> 22:31.932
How hard is it to call?

22:31.967 --> 22:33.033
The traffic... come here. Come here.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.002
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:36.071 --> 22:38.438
'Sup, cuz? Still selling out to the man?

22:38.474 --> 22:39.940
Are you still living in
your mama's basement?

22:39.975 --> 22:40.774
Sonia?

22:40.809 --> 22:42.009
- Yeah, whatever.
- Is that you?

22:43.445 --> 22:45.145
Oh!

22:45.181 --> 22:46.880
So, are you two back together?

22:46.916 --> 22:49.116
No. No. We are not together.

22:49.151 --> 22:50.217
Oh. iEstÃºpido!

22:50.252 --> 22:52.085
Don't let this one get away twice.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.888
- Come. Eat, eat.
- Okay.

22:54.924 --> 22:57.824
I made Javier's favorite... mofongo.
Whoo!

23:09.705 --> 23:12.039
You're a lucky man, Javi.

23:12.074 --> 23:13.307
And why's that?

23:13.342 --> 23:14.779
Your family.

23:16.345 --> 23:18.545
You know, I really never had one.

23:18.581 --> 23:20.113
My Dad left when I was 5,

23:20.149 --> 23:24.151
and Mom had two jobs just
to keep the lights on.

23:24.186 --> 23:27.221
I have a lot of regrets, Javi...

23:27.256 --> 23:28.789
Bad choices,

23:28.824 --> 23:31.391
compromises I made...

23:32.861 --> 23:34.428
the path I took.

23:35.764 --> 23:37.631
If things would have been different,

23:37.666 --> 23:40.934
we'd have had a family
of our own by now.

23:40.970 --> 23:42.135
If...

23:43.973 --> 23:45.559
It would have been good.

23:48.544 --> 23:50.077
I better get you back.

23:50.112 --> 23:52.312
Can I at least take that hot shower?

23:52.348 --> 23:54.548
Please?

23:55.384 --> 23:56.550
10 minutes, okay?

23:56.585 --> 23:57.851
And then we got to hit the road.

24:06.562 --> 24:08.262
You can join me if you want.

24:11.533 --> 24:15.168
Uh, I don't...
I don't think that would be a good idea.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.204
I'll leave the door unlocked

24:17.239 --> 24:19.973
just in case you change your mind.

24:27.483 --> 24:28.815
Nah.

24:35.991 --> 24:36.757
Great.

24:36.792 --> 24:37.591
Hey, Ryan.

24:37.626 --> 24:38.659
Hey, Javi, listen to me.

24:38.694 --> 24:39.626
Yep.

24:39.662 --> 24:41.361
Our victim was the inside man.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.463
He communicated with the
killer using a burner cell.

24:43.499 --> 24:45.332
I pulled the records
from the killer's phone.

24:45.367 --> 24:46.867
I traced the calls it made.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.770
There were three made to Sonia's prison.

24:49.805 --> 24:51.571
What... What are you saying?

24:51.607 --> 24:53.907
Sonia was in on it.

25:07.056 --> 25:09.656
I can't believe I was so stupid.

25:09.815 --> 25:11.190
She played me.

25:11.226 --> 25:13.426
Yeah. She sure did, buddy.

25:13.461 --> 25:16.495
Kevin, I fixed you your own plate.

25:16.531 --> 25:17.263
Gracias, Mami.

25:19.534 --> 25:21.634
What are you doing?

25:21.669 --> 25:22.935
Dude, it's your Mom's mofongo.

25:22.971 --> 25:24.637
The whole world could be ending.
I'd still be chowing down.

25:24.672 --> 25:25.938
Wait. Where's Beckett?

25:25.974 --> 25:28.441
Well, she doesn't know,
because if she did...

25:28.476 --> 25:30.543
you'd be in deep trouble.

25:30.578 --> 25:33.546
So we're gonna track your girl down

25:33.581 --> 25:34.680
before the Captain finds out.

25:34.716 --> 25:36.449
No,
I-I-I can't ask you to do that for me.

25:36.484 --> 25:38.117
You don't have to. I'm volunteering.

25:38.152 --> 25:39.986
All right?
So let's turn your brain back on.

25:40.021 --> 25:41.954
If Sonia was communicating
with the killer

25:41.990 --> 25:44.156
and she orchestrated this
whole armored car heist

25:44.192 --> 25:46.459
to look exactly like the
one she went to prison for,

25:46.494 --> 25:48.160
knowing that we'd go to talk to her...

25:48.196 --> 25:50.396
Then Sonia would get
out and lead us to Joey,

25:50.431 --> 25:52.665
who pulled pulled a gun
so she could run away.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.467
The whole thing was an escape plan

25:54.502 --> 25:56.435
that she set up with Joey beforehand.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.537
Unfortunately for Sonia,
we ran her down.

25:58.573 --> 26:00.273
Okay, assuming all this is true,
why now?

26:00.308 --> 26:02.842
I mean,
she had three months left until parole.

26:02.877 --> 26:04.176
Why throw that all away?

26:04.212 --> 26:05.111
I don't know.

26:05.146 --> 26:06.679
But I bet you Joey does.

26:06.714 --> 26:08.247
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:08.283 --> 26:09.682
We pulled your financials, Joey.

26:09.717 --> 26:11.717
You know, it turns out that
Chicken-Chicken-Chicken

26:11.753 --> 26:13.419
is bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt.

26:13.454 --> 26:15.254
I'm doing some corporate restructuring.

26:15.290 --> 26:16.455
All right? That's no crime.

26:16.491 --> 26:18.858
We also found a pair of
phone calls to your phone

26:18.893 --> 26:20.626
from the same burner phone
that called our victim.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.528
Now,
that makes you an accessory to murder.

26:22.563 --> 26:23.963
Okay.

26:23.998 --> 26:26.699
I got a phone call from
a guy that I never met.

26:26.734 --> 26:28.968
Said he knew I was in trouble,
and he offered to bail me out.

26:29.003 --> 26:29.935
How much would that take?

26:31.105 --> 26:33.072
Half a million.

26:36.878 --> 26:39.679
They didn't get a fraction
of that from the bank job.

26:41.683 --> 26:44.583
Sonia's share of the gold...
We never found it.

26:44.619 --> 26:45.851
Maybe that's why she broke out.

26:45.887 --> 26:46.986
But, again, why now?

26:47.021 --> 26:48.854
That money will still be
there in three months.

26:50.925 --> 26:51.991
Play time's over, Joey.

26:52.026 --> 26:53.159
You better tell us who this guy is,

26:53.194 --> 26:54.694
or you're gonna be living
in an eight-foot cell

26:54.729 --> 26:56.095
until they carry you
out in a six-foot box.

26:56.130 --> 26:58.497
I swear I'm telling the truth.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.833
All right, all I know is
that he was an ex-boyfriend.

27:03.004 --> 27:04.537
I don't know any of
Sonia's ex-boyfriends.

27:04.572 --> 27:06.238
Why don't you see if you
can I.D. any of them?

27:06.274 --> 27:08.040
Meanwhile,
I'll pull visitor logs from the prison.

27:08.076 --> 27:10.209
All right.

27:10.244 --> 27:10.976
It's Beckett.

27:11.012 --> 27:11.977
Ah.

27:12.046 --> 27:14.013
Hey, Captain. Hey. How's it going?

27:14.048 --> 27:15.548
Fine. Just running down leads.

27:15.583 --> 27:17.450
Uh-huh. And how's Javi holding up?

27:17.485 --> 27:18.951
Well, he's been better.

27:18.986 --> 27:20.119
Well, you know what?

27:20.154 --> 27:21.487
I'll bring some cronuts
by in the morning.

27:21.522 --> 27:23.255
That usually cheers him up.

27:23.291 --> 27:24.857
Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

27:24.892 --> 27:26.258
Everything all right?

27:26.294 --> 27:27.893
I don't know. I hope so.

27:27.929 --> 27:29.595
- This'll make it better.
- Thank you.

27:29.630 --> 27:32.365
I have to say, Katherine,

27:32.400 --> 27:35.000
it is so good to have you home.

27:35.036 --> 27:35.835
Thank you.

27:35.870 --> 27:37.002
I second that motion.

27:37.038 --> 27:37.970
Oh, thank you.

27:40.408 --> 27:41.307
Ohh.

27:41.342 --> 27:42.975
Lucy! What the hell?

27:43.010 --> 27:44.410
Turn it off!

27:44.445 --> 27:45.644
Whoa, language, Kate.

27:45.680 --> 27:46.612
Is there a problem?

27:46.647 --> 27:48.180
Oh, really?

27:48.216 --> 27:50.750
Well, then, let me make it up to you.

27:54.021 --> 27:57.456
Isn't that a little extreme?

27:57.492 --> 28:00.259
No. No, actually, I-I-I don't think so.

28:00.294 --> 28:01.994
Look, uh, this... this might sound odd,

28:02.029 --> 28:04.930
but ever since I got back,
it's like Lucy's been jealous.

28:04.966 --> 28:08.167
She's an "it."
A C.P.U. wrapped in a plastic pyramid.

28:08.202 --> 28:09.735
She doesn't have emotions,

28:09.771 --> 28:11.237
and she certainly can't be jealous.

28:13.608 --> 28:14.940
You were saying?

28:14.976 --> 28:16.475
So...
So, you're telling me she's only had

28:16.511 --> 28:18.844
one visitor in the last year?

28:18.880 --> 28:20.913
All right, what's the name?

28:20.948 --> 28:23.416
Alberto Pena.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.818
All right, thanks.

28:28.055 --> 28:30.990
Whoa, you're an old-ass boyfriend.

28:34.128 --> 28:36.462
No.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.063
You're Sonia's father.

28:40.034 --> 28:42.168
Hey, Jenkins, have you seen Esposito?

28:42.203 --> 28:44.136
Yeah, he ran out of here 10 minutes ago.

28:47.775 --> 28:48.541
Yeah?

28:48.576 --> 28:49.809
What are you doing?

28:49.844 --> 28:52.144
I can't let you put yourself
out there for me anymore, bro.

28:52.180 --> 28:54.346
This is my mess,
and I got to clean it up.

28:57.485 --> 28:58.851
All right. Everybody stop!

28:58.886 --> 29:01.353
I need to know what Esposito found out

29:01.389 --> 29:02.922
when he ran out of here.

29:02.957 --> 29:05.691
Please, it's a matter of life and death.

29:11.899 --> 29:15.367
Sonia! Get away from the bed!

29:16.204 --> 29:18.003
My Dad, he's dying.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

29:18.039 --> 29:19.104
Just stop it.

29:19.140 --> 29:20.039
I'm not buying any of it.

29:20.074 --> 29:21.307
You didn't break out of prison

29:21.342 --> 29:24.410
just because your old man
was kicking the bucket.

29:28.382 --> 29:30.049
He has your share of the gold.

29:30.084 --> 29:31.884
When you found out he had a stroke,

29:31.919 --> 29:33.486
you panicked because you were worried

29:33.521 --> 29:34.987
that his new wife was
gonna steal your gold.

29:35.022 --> 29:36.522
The thing I don't get is,
why didn't you just have

29:36.557 --> 29:39.124
your partner on the
outside get it for you?

29:40.127 --> 29:41.594
You don't know where it is.

29:50.638 --> 29:52.505
Jimmy Sanchez wasn't Great White.

29:52.540 --> 29:53.873
Your father is.

29:53.908 --> 29:57.209
And he kept your share of
the gold after you went in.

29:57.245 --> 30:01.614
Javi, Javi, you were always
too smart for your own good.

30:07.455 --> 30:09.588
NYPD!

30:24.778 --> 30:26.944
I can't believe the two of you

30:26.980 --> 30:28.446
kept me in the dark about this.

30:28.481 --> 30:29.414
Captain, I'm sorry.

30:29.449 --> 30:30.848
No. We will talk about this later.

30:30.884 --> 30:33.050
Right now,
let's just focus on finding Espo.

30:33.086 --> 30:34.886
I just hope it's not too late.

30:34.921 --> 30:36.821
If Sonia and her partner
wanted to kill Esposito,

30:36.856 --> 30:37.789
they would have done it here.

30:37.824 --> 30:40.158
No, t-they must need him for something.

30:40.193 --> 30:41.692
The question is,
why was Sonia so desperate

30:41.728 --> 30:42.960
to see her father before he died?

30:42.996 --> 30:44.829
According to Espo,
they weren't even that close.

30:44.864 --> 30:46.664
Maybe he has something she wanted.

30:47.901 --> 30:49.967
And I think I know what it is.

30:53.940 --> 30:55.239
Gold.

30:55.275 --> 30:57.375
He was holding her cut of the
heist from nine years ago.

30:57.410 --> 30:59.343
Sonia didn't want the secret
of the gold's location

30:59.379 --> 31:00.745
to die with her father.

31:00.780 --> 31:02.647
They took Esposito for insurance
in case we tried to stop them.

31:02.682 --> 31:04.982
Which means we find Pena's coin stash,
we'll find Espo.

31:05.018 --> 31:06.951
Problem is, we don't know the
first thing about this guy.

31:06.986 --> 31:09.754
Well, time for a crash course.
Let's tear this place apart.

31:09.789 --> 31:11.022
Right.

31:18.231 --> 31:20.164
Javi, you awake?

31:20.200 --> 31:21.098
How's your head?

31:23.002 --> 31:24.402
I'm fine.

31:24.437 --> 31:26.604
Your boy toy hits like a little bitch.

31:26.639 --> 31:27.972
You know, I'm sorry, Javi.

31:28.007 --> 31:29.674
It wasn't supposed go like this.

31:29.709 --> 31:30.908
No one was meant to get hurt.

31:30.944 --> 31:32.944
Forget hurt...
Two little kids don't have a dad today

31:32.979 --> 31:34.378
because of you and your boyfriend.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.481
Don't think that's not tearing me up.

31:36.516 --> 31:37.748
You have to believe me, Javi.

31:37.784 --> 31:39.550
I didn't know Ronaldo
was gonna kill that man.

31:39.586 --> 31:41.719
That is such a cop-out.

31:41.754 --> 31:43.721
You knew what he was capable of.

31:43.756 --> 31:45.790
I just didn't think that you were.

31:45.825 --> 31:48.526
I thought that, deep down,
you had a good heart.

31:48.561 --> 31:51.229
I know that you had a tough
go when you were little,

31:51.264 --> 31:54.131
but sooner or later,
you got to stop blaming your childhood.

31:54.167 --> 31:57.639
At some point,
when you choose wrong over right...

31:58.538 --> 31:59.770
that's on you.

31:59.806 --> 32:02.640
It's always been so
black-and-white with you, huh?

32:02.709 --> 32:04.575
Espo's rules of life.

32:04.611 --> 32:05.776
Well, let me tell you something.

32:05.812 --> 32:07.879
I spent nine years in that cell

32:07.914 --> 32:10.047
while Joey and my dad breathed free air

32:10.083 --> 32:11.482
and spent their millions.

32:11.518 --> 32:13.451
All I had to hold on to was the money.

32:13.486 --> 32:15.953
No way in hell I was gonna let that go.

32:15.989 --> 32:17.755
This is it up ahead.

32:17.790 --> 32:20.725
Well, I hope that money's worth it,

32:20.760 --> 32:23.594
'cause you're gonna have to
live with what you've done

32:23.630 --> 32:25.129
for the rest of your life.

32:39.879 --> 32:41.746
You should really be nicer to the lady.

32:41.781 --> 32:44.348
Not that her little soft
spot's gonna save you,

32:44.384 --> 32:46.384
'cause once we get that gold...

32:49.222 --> 32:50.187
Sonia's Dad owned

32:50.223 --> 32:51.656
at least half a dozen businesses...

32:51.691 --> 32:54.358
Dry cleaners, car wash,
a Cuban restaurant?

32:54.394 --> 32:56.327
All high cash flow. Makes sense.

32:56.362 --> 32:57.995
If he was selling off
his gold bit by bit,

32:58.031 --> 32:59.330
he'd need a place to launder the money.

32:59.365 --> 33:01.098
Well,
according to the company's bank records,

33:01.134 --> 33:03.134
the weekly receipts were pretty uniform.

33:03.169 --> 33:04.735
Except, look at this,
the dry cleaners...

33:04.771 --> 33:06.370
About three months ago,
there was a spike

33:06.406 --> 33:07.772
in the weekly deposit amount

33:07.807 --> 33:11.342
and three months before
that and before that.

33:11.377 --> 33:12.777
Same with the restaurant.

33:12.812 --> 33:15.179
So he was retrieving some of
the gold every three months,

33:15.214 --> 33:16.581
selling it off,
and then running the proceeds

33:16.616 --> 33:17.715
through his businesses.

33:17.750 --> 33:18.849
Hey, Ryan, where is Vikram

33:18.885 --> 33:20.518
with the GPS info from Pena's phone?

33:20.553 --> 33:21.719
He just sent this over.

33:21.754 --> 33:23.754
Pena stayed close to
home most of the time,

33:23.790 --> 33:25.423
except for this location.

33:25.458 --> 33:26.991
Looks to be an outlier.

33:27.026 --> 33:28.593
He wouldn't go there often,
only once every...

33:28.628 --> 33:29.460
Every three months?

33:29.495 --> 33:30.595
Exactly. And only at night.

33:30.630 --> 33:31.495
And what's there?

33:31.531 --> 33:33.331
Let's see, uh...

33:33.366 --> 33:35.600
It's an old Con Ed storage facility.

33:35.635 --> 33:37.034
Perfect place for stashing coins.

33:37.070 --> 33:38.603
Pena owned a transport company

33:38.638 --> 33:40.137
that subcontracts with Con Ed.

33:40.173 --> 33:41.405
Then that's it. That's where he is.

33:41.441 --> 33:42.840
Let's go. Once they find the gold,

33:42.875 --> 33:43.874
they're gonna make a run for it.

33:43.910 --> 33:46.077
After they kill Espo.

33:47.113 --> 33:49.013
You guys should just turn yourselves in.

33:49.048 --> 33:51.349
Even if you do get away with the gold,

33:51.384 --> 33:53.985
there's no place you can go
where my guys won't find you.

33:54.020 --> 33:55.119
Well, maybe.

33:55.154 --> 33:57.722
But I like my odds a lot
more than yours right now.

33:58.925 --> 34:00.057
She said it would be up there.

34:00.093 --> 34:01.359
You go up.

34:01.394 --> 34:02.927
I'll stay here with him.

34:22.715 --> 34:24.782
Careful, baby.

34:44.637 --> 34:46.570
Wow. Haven't seen you smile like that

34:46.606 --> 34:48.072
since I gave you the ring.

34:48.107 --> 34:50.274
Shut up.

34:50.309 --> 34:52.677
Seems so long ago, doesn't it?

34:52.712 --> 34:55.413
It was a different life.

34:56.849 --> 34:58.215
What are you doing?

34:58.251 --> 35:01.285
We can't carry the gold and
watch him at the same time.

35:01.320 --> 35:04.255
So this is where his story ends.

35:09.516 --> 35:10.282
No.

35:10.317 --> 35:11.316
Come on, babe.

35:11.351 --> 35:12.651
Don't even pretend like you didn't know

35:12.686 --> 35:13.752
it was gonna go down this way.

35:13.787 --> 35:15.487
Turn away if you don't want to see it.

35:15.522 --> 35:16.555
Mm-hmm.

35:18.592 --> 35:20.992
What the hell?

35:21.028 --> 35:22.627
I can't let you do that.

35:22.663 --> 35:23.795
We don't have time for this.

35:23.831 --> 35:25.330
He's got to die, and we got to go.

35:25.365 --> 35:28.667
No. We leave him here alive.

35:28.702 --> 35:32.170
He was your fiancé,
and he threw you away.

35:32.206 --> 35:33.538
He left you to rot in prison.

35:33.574 --> 35:35.340
I was the one who was there for you.

35:35.375 --> 35:38.677
So, why are you willing
to shoot me save him?

35:38.712 --> 35:40.391
Because I love him.

35:49.890 --> 35:51.156
Stop, Javi. Javi!

35:51.191 --> 35:51.957
Javi, stop!

35:55.762 --> 35:58.163
It's over, Sonia.

35:58.198 --> 35:59.431
No.

36:01.235 --> 36:03.235
I won't go back. I can't.

36:03.270 --> 36:05.003
You can.

36:09.142 --> 36:11.243
And you will.

36:11.278 --> 36:14.446
Nine years ago,
I found out you were a thief.

36:14.481 --> 36:15.714
You know what I did then?

36:15.749 --> 36:16.848
Yeah.

36:16.884 --> 36:17.716
You arrested me.

36:17.751 --> 36:18.950
No.

36:18.986 --> 36:23.154
I went home, and I packed a bag.

36:23.190 --> 36:25.056
And then I grabbed my passport,

36:25.092 --> 36:27.153
cleared out my savings

36:28.829 --> 36:31.663
I was ready to abandon
everything I believed in...

36:33.901 --> 36:37.202
because I couldn't picture
a life without you.

36:37.237 --> 36:38.403
Why didn't you?

36:38.438 --> 36:41.673
I'm a cop, Sonia. I...

36:43.076 --> 36:45.544
It's all I ever wanted to be.

36:45.579 --> 36:46.645
If I threw that away,

36:46.680 --> 36:48.413
then I wouldn't even deserve you.

36:48.448 --> 36:51.082
We've got a second chance, Javi.

36:51.118 --> 36:53.469
We can run now. It can be like it was.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.156
No.

37:03.830 --> 37:05.964
It can never be like it was.

37:07.034 --> 37:09.634
If I was strong enough
to walk up those steps

37:09.670 --> 37:12.637
and arrest the love of my life,

37:13.029 --> 37:16.841
then you are strong enough
to face what comes next.

37:18.345 --> 37:19.344
NYPD!

37:22.683 --> 37:23.748
You okay, partner?

37:23.784 --> 37:25.116
Yeah.

37:25.152 --> 37:26.217
Turn around.

37:26.253 --> 37:27.852
Let's go. All right.

37:27.888 --> 37:29.020
Please.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.939
I'm sorry. I screwed up.

37:47.975 --> 37:50.041
I let my feelings for
Sonia cloud my judgment,

37:50.077 --> 37:52.381
and... and I let my guard down.

37:56.016 --> 37:57.816
I... Look, I'm not gonna pretend

37:57.851 --> 37:58.984
that I haven't done the same thing,

37:59.019 --> 38:00.852
but I am captain now.

38:00.887 --> 38:03.622
So I have to suspend you for a week...
no pay.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.459
Yes, ma'am.

38:13.700 --> 38:15.186
You did the right thing.

38:23.543 --> 38:24.776
Can you give us a sec?

38:26.880 --> 38:30.882
So, uh, I talked to the D.A.,
and when the dust settles,

38:30.917 --> 38:32.884
he's willing to let you
plead out as an accessory

38:32.919 --> 38:37.055
if you testify against Ronaldo.

38:37.090 --> 38:38.923
How many more years?

38:39.426 --> 38:40.722
At least two.

38:43.563 --> 38:45.096
Are you gonna come visit me this time?

38:45.132 --> 38:46.297
Yeah.

38:46.333 --> 38:49.267
Hmm. Are you gonna bring me
a cake with a file in it?

38:49.302 --> 38:50.235
Probably not.

38:53.674 --> 38:55.607
Thank God you didn't go bald.

38:55.642 --> 38:57.642
I was just thinking the
same thing about you.

39:02.049 --> 39:03.815
Take care of yourself, Sonia.

39:03.850 --> 39:04.582
You, too.

39:05.652 --> 39:06.418
I'll see you soon.

39:06.486 --> 39:07.852
I hope so.

39:18.465 --> 39:20.165
So, what are you gonna do now?

39:20.200 --> 39:21.366
I don't know.

39:21.401 --> 39:23.268
Turns out I got the
rest of the day free.

39:23.303 --> 39:26.104
Yeah, me too.
I, uh, just called in sick.

39:26.139 --> 39:27.572
Let's go get really drunk.

39:27.607 --> 39:29.674
Damn straight.

39:30.811 --> 39:32.310
Home at last,

39:32.345 --> 39:35.180
with all the makings
of a perfect evening...

39:35.215 --> 39:38.950
Thai food, a bottle of Pino,
and my two favorite ladies.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.318
Wait, two?

39:40.353 --> 39:41.720
Is that a joke about my boobs?

39:41.755 --> 39:43.955
I'm referring, of course,
to you and Lucy.

39:43.990 --> 39:46.191
Oh, right. Lucy.

39:46.226 --> 39:47.826
Oh, come on, don't be mad. I'm kidding.

39:47.861 --> 39:50.161
Is... Is it too late to
say it's about your boobs?

39:50.197 --> 39:51.763
No. It's... It's fine.

39:51.798 --> 39:53.965
The truth is,
is that I overreacted the other day.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.034
I have a feeling that
Lucy and I are gonna be

39:56.069 --> 39:57.569
on much better terms from here on out.

39:57.604 --> 39:58.903
And I am glad to hear it.

39:58.939 --> 40:00.004
You hear that, Lucy?

40:00.040 --> 40:01.439
I knew you'd win her over.

40:01.475 --> 40:02.974
Now, why don't you dim the lights for us

40:03.009 --> 40:04.175
just a little bit?

40:04.211 --> 40:06.211
How's that, Rick?

40:06.246 --> 40:08.480
A-Are the lights not
to your satisfaction?

40:08.515 --> 40:09.514
No, they're fine.

40:09.549 --> 40:12.884
Just, uh, who are you, and where's Lucy?

40:12.919 --> 40:14.152
My name's Linus,

40:14.187 --> 40:17.822
and I'm starting to
think you don't like me.

40:17.858 --> 40:20.158
Oh, okay, very funny. What did you do?

40:20.193 --> 40:21.993
I-I read the user's manual,
and, apparently,

40:22.028 --> 40:23.561
with the simple flick of a switch,

40:23.597 --> 40:24.629
she can become a he.

40:24.664 --> 40:25.930
You killed Lucy?

40:25.966 --> 40:28.500
No. I didn't kill her.
I mean, she's still in there.

40:28.535 --> 40:29.601
Why?

40:29.636 --> 40:31.038
You want her back?

40:32.806 --> 40:33.938
No. Of course not.

40:33.974 --> 40:35.640
No. No. Linus it is.

40:35.675 --> 40:36.474
All right, good.

40:36.543 --> 40:37.575
Well, I'm gonna go change,

40:37.611 --> 40:39.010
so why don't you guys become acquainted?

40:39.045 --> 40:40.478
All right.

40:41.681 --> 40:44.048
Okay, Linus.
Let's get this bromance started.

40:44.084 --> 40:46.017
How about you make me
a little cappuccino?

40:46.052 --> 40:47.886
It's a little late for caffeine, Rick.

40:47.921 --> 40:50.321
How about some relaxing
yoga stretches before bed?

40:50.357 --> 40:51.656
And experiment's over.

40:51.691 --> 40:52.657
Where's that switch?

40:52.692 --> 40:54.459
Ow!

40:54.494 --> 40:55.727
Linus, you gave me a little shock.

40:55.762 --> 40:57.295
I think you must have
a short or something.

40:57.330 --> 40:59.197
I don't like to be touched, Rick.

40:59.232 --> 41:01.633
Not by you, anyway.

41:04.037 --> 41:05.403
Beckett.

41:06.773 --> 41:07.658
Beckett!
