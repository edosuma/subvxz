WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:07.205
At last, the end of the
Serpentine Road was in sight!

00:07.299 --> 00:12.384
Under tremendous gravity, the first
training assignment given by Kaio

00:12.471 --> 00:17.010
is to chase after his pet, Bubbles-kun.

00:17.101 --> 00:21.344
158 days remain until the Saiyans arrive.

00:21.438 --> 00:25.306
How strong can Goku become?

00:27.986 --> 00:30.898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
I'II protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your soul already knows the answer

01:46.565 --> 01:50.183
Dragon Soul!

01:52.738 --> 01:58.734
"The Battle With 10-Times Gravity!
Goku, Your Training is a Race. "

02:08.836 --> 02:11.544
It's amazing the way you eat...

02:13.133 --> 02:15.749
You could be a little more...

02:15.844 --> 02:18.551
Hey, how about holding back a little?

02:18.639 --> 02:20.755
I'm swiping ["bundoru"]
your rice bowls ["donburi"]!

02:22.059 --> 02:25.267
Swiping the rice bowls!

02:25.354 --> 02:28.517
How is that a pun?

02:28.607 --> 02:29.972
I'm full, I'm full!

02:30.067 --> 02:32.934
The flavor notwithstanding,
at least my belly is full.

02:33.028 --> 02:38.898
I'm getting the feeling that
this man doesn't respect me.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.493
You know something, Kaio-sama?

02:40.577 --> 02:45.913
I'm surprised you don't get
bored staying on this little planet.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.830
How young you are.

02:47.918 --> 02:54.005
There are any number of fun
things to do here, if you feel like it.

02:54.091 --> 02:57.128
Like counting how many
blades of grass there are,

02:57.219 --> 02:59.551
looking up at the sky,

02:59.638 --> 03:04.052
or peeing for distance.

03:04.142 --> 03:07.134
Lately, the hobby I've been caught up in...

03:08.313 --> 03:10.895
...is going for drives.

03:16.780 --> 03:20.022
Now, hurry up and catch Bubbles-kun.

03:20.117 --> 03:24.281
Otherwise, I won't ever
teach you any martial arts.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.612
Y-Yeah, I'll try my hardest.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.867
All right...

03:27.958 --> 03:29.494
Oh, yeah...

03:29.585 --> 03:31.701
Put those heavy-looking clothes
and boots you took off earlier

03:31.795 --> 03:34.207
back on before you start running.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.834
That will make this more effective.

03:35.924 --> 03:39.883
If I put those on, it will be
much, much harder to run.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.052
I'll let you in on a little something.

03:42.139 --> 03:47.008
The world that the Saiyans are from
had about the same gravity as here.

03:47.102 --> 03:50.515
That's where they built up their bodies.

03:52.190 --> 03:56.650
Are you starting to understand
the secret to the Saiyans' strength?

03:56.737 --> 03:58.523
But there's more to it than just that.

03:58.614 --> 04:03.153
Saiyans have an inborn fighting sense.

04:03.243 --> 04:07.236
That's another dangerous thing about them.

04:07.331 --> 04:11.040
Hey, that's all right. I'm a Saiyan, too!

04:30.228 --> 04:31.388
Nice jab.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.892
But don't let up on your attack!

04:40.781 --> 04:41.896
Uncle!

04:41.990 --> 04:44.072
Help me!

04:45.535 --> 04:49.824
Don't try playing the baby
to me, you dirty brat!

04:53.710 --> 04:57.123
Sure enough, he only displays
that latent power of his

04:57.214 --> 04:59.956
on a night with a full moon.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.188
Ow-w-w-w...

05:14.272 --> 05:16.604
Hmph, it looks like you've at least gotten over

05:16.692 --> 05:19.274
your crybaby ways during
these last six months, huh?

05:20.779 --> 05:25.614
Say, Piccolo-san, you fought
with my father long ago, right?

05:25.701 --> 05:29.319
That fight still isn't over yet.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.404
If we're able to defeat the Saiyans,

05:31.498 --> 05:34.205
your father's turn will be next.

05:34.292 --> 05:38.410
But Father said that after you
were reborn, Piccolo-san,

05:38.505 --> 05:42.544
you don't seem to be as
full-blown bad as you were before.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.002
I kind of think so, too.

05:46.096 --> 05:50.430
My mother and grandfather
were afraid of you, though.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.475
Stop talking rubbish and get to sleep, already!

05:53.562 --> 05:56.349
Tomorrow's training won't be
as gentle as this has been!

05:56.440 --> 05:57.976
Right!

06:11.163 --> 06:13.199
Damn it all...

06:14.624 --> 06:20.415
And so, in the blink of an eye,
three weeks went by.

06:22.507 --> 06:25.214
I doubt you know how good...

06:27.220 --> 06:28.630
...these shao-mai dumplings taste...

06:28.722 --> 06:32.089
...these shao-mai ["shumai"] dumplings...
I doubt you know ["shirumai"]...

06:33.727 --> 06:35.934
That was great, that was great!

06:38.148 --> 06:41.515
Huh? Is anyone listening?

06:43.904 --> 06:46.270
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it!

06:47.991 --> 06:50.778
I've got a whole pile ["gyousan"]
of potstickers ["gyoza"]!

06:50.869 --> 06:52.575
Hold it!

07:01.421 --> 07:03.503
Now!

07:03.590 --> 07:05.376
So close!

07:11.431 --> 07:13.467
Rats!

07:15.143 --> 07:16.599
All right...!

07:19.481 --> 07:22.814
Oh, you're sure in high spirits, huh?

07:22.901 --> 07:27.941
--Hold it!
--I knew it! They really don't respect me!

07:47.050 --> 07:49.917
He really is awesome, huh?

07:50.011 --> 07:52.388
But he's not gonna get the best of me!

08:03.984 --> 08:06.270
I'm so close...

08:10.198 --> 08:12.189
That's it! All right!

08:19.291 --> 08:20.952
Sure enough!

08:25.213 --> 08:26.953
All right!

08:27.048 --> 08:28.629
Hold it!

08:36.057 --> 08:37.763
Hold it!

08:47.861 --> 08:49.522
I did it!

08:50.822 --> 08:54.906
I finally did it! I caught you!

08:57.537 --> 09:00.153
He's as amazing as I thought.

09:00.248 --> 09:05.493
He's already overcome the gravity here, has he?

09:05.587 --> 09:10.627
He just might be able to master the Kaio-ken.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.345
Get up, already!

09:30.070 --> 09:33.654
Don't get cocky, just because you've
managed to dodge me once or twice.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.571
You're still soft!

09:48.046 --> 09:50.287
Help me!

10:06.815 --> 10:09.522
Get back up here, by yourself!

10:55.989 --> 10:57.149
Squirrel! ["risu"]

10:57.240 --> 10:58.650
Watermelon! ["suika"]

10:58.742 --> 11:00.357
Sea gull! ["kamome"]

11:00.452 --> 11:01.737
Killifish! ["medaka"]

11:01.828 --> 11:03.068
Monster! [" kaijuu"]

11:03.163 --> 11:04.369
Cow! [" ushi"]

11:04.456 --> 11:05.866
Polar bear! ["shirokuma"]

11:05.957 --> 11:07.037
Ball! ["mari"]

11:07.125 --> 11:08.456
Apple! ["ringo"]

11:08.543 --> 11:09.783
Gorilla! ["gorira"]

11:09.878 --> 11:11.584
Lion! [" raion"]

11:11.671 --> 11:13.832
You say the next one!

11:25.685 --> 11:29.519
Ten-san and Yamucha-san have
both become even more incredible!

11:47.665 --> 11:50.532
Yajirobe, take this seriously!

11:52.962 --> 11:54.623
Why, you...!

11:57.634 --> 12:00.341
Yow-w-w-w-w-w!

12:22.492 --> 12:25.984
I did it!

12:26.079 --> 12:28.320
I did it, I did it!

12:30.834 --> 12:33.325
Kaio-sama, what should I do next?

12:33.420 --> 12:37.004
What should you do? Let's see...

12:37.090 --> 12:39.376
--You're willing to do ["suru"] anything?
--Yeah.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.004
Then how about grinding ["suru"]
some sesame seeds?

12:48.476 --> 12:52.435
Kaio-sama, l have to train
quickly, or the Saiyans will...

12:52.522 --> 12:57.186
Hmph, don't be so hasty.
You still have 135 days.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.393
That's no time at all!

13:16.087 --> 13:18.464
What was that?

13:18.548 --> 13:20.539
It's about time for it to come back.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.589
Come back?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.389
Here it comes...

13:37.984 --> 13:42.273
"No time at all" ["attoiuma"] is
"quite an armadillo" ["kekkou arumajiro"].

13:42.363 --> 13:44.274
That was great, that was great! Not bad at all.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.072
Are you really all that strong?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.196
How rude!

13:57.003 --> 13:59.164
W-What was that?

14:03.551 --> 14:05.837
Y-You look like a grasshopper, huh?

14:05.929 --> 14:07.419
G-Grasshopper ["batta"]?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.971
That's ridiculous ["baka"]!

14:11.100 --> 14:13.716
--Ah, that was great!
--Y-You are ill-mannered.

14:13.811 --> 14:18.976
My name is Gregory, and I look
after Kaio-sama's personal care.

14:21.194 --> 14:26.939
Kaio-sama, the one who governs
all other deities in the universe...

14:28.076 --> 14:31.364
"That's ridiculous!"

14:31.454 --> 14:33.740
Ahem. You have some nerve, saying,

14:33.831 --> 14:38.370
"Are you really all that strong?" to Kaio-sama.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.747
There's a limit to how much
ignorance ["muchi"] I can stand.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.671
But I ain't got a whip ["muchi"].

14:46.344 --> 14:49.051
Son Goku, you show a lot of promise!

14:49.138 --> 14:53.552
Kaio-sama, this is no time
for you to be laughing!

14:53.643 --> 14:55.053
This works out perfectly, Son Goku.

14:55.144 --> 14:59.729
After Bubbles-kun, you will next
be taking on Gregory there.

14:59.816 --> 15:00.931
This guy?

15:01.025 --> 15:03.186
What is that look on your face for?

15:03.278 --> 15:07.487
I was hoping to get trained
by Kaio-sama himself.

15:07.574 --> 15:11.066
Kaio-sama, I am downright enraged!

15:11.160 --> 15:15.028
I would like to take this fellow
down a peg for taking me so lightly!

15:15.123 --> 15:17.705
--May |?
--Very well.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.708
What's that?

15:21.796 --> 15:25.380
K-Kaio-sama, that's a little
on the large side, isn't it?

15:25.466 --> 15:28.128
Son Goku, here!

15:30.597 --> 15:32.963
Well? Heavy, right?

15:36.227 --> 15:40.721
Your next training is to swat
Gregory using that hammer.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.476
With this?

15:44.444 --> 15:48.904
Once you are able to do that,
I will train you myself.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.105
All right, I'll try!

15:50.199 --> 15:54.863
Hmph, as if a rookie like
you could ever catch me!

16:16.601 --> 16:18.762
H-He's fast!

16:21.856 --> 16:23.642
Damn!

16:36.829 --> 16:39.696
It looks like this is going to take a while.

16:39.791 --> 16:43.875
Ow-w-w-w... All right, I'll get you this time!

16:43.961 --> 16:45.701
Huh...?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.174
That little jerk!

16:52.261 --> 16:54.092
Hold still, you!

16:58.059 --> 17:00.266
Wait up!

17:03.147 --> 17:05.137
He wouldn't!

17:13.116 --> 17:16.108
l-lt's nice that's he's so high-spirited...!

17:44.731 --> 17:47.438
I swear I'm gonna get stronger than the Saiyans!

17:50.278 --> 17:52.360
Rats!

17:52.447 --> 17:56.235
You have all far surpassed me.

17:56.325 --> 18:00.739
There is nothing more that
Mister Popo and I can teach you.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.412
From here on, until the conflict is upon us,

18:03.499 --> 18:07.367
descend back down to the ground,
and each of you hone your techniques.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.248
The future is in your hands now.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.373
Right!

18:10.465 --> 18:13.798
Uh, so it's okay fer us to get outta
these heavy shirts now, right?

18:13.885 --> 18:15.716
Do as you wish.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.294
Guys, let's get back down there
and put the finishing touches on!

18:18.389 --> 18:20.801
We should be able to power
ourselves up even further.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.258
We've all become amazing!

18:23.352 --> 18:27.812
Goku, I can't wait to see
what will become of you.

18:29.025 --> 18:32.313
After two weeks of carrying the hammer...

18:47.335 --> 18:48.996
Almost there!

18:50.379 --> 18:52.631
He's relentless!

18:52.715 --> 18:54.251
All right...!

19:11.025 --> 19:13.437
Oh, no!

19:13.528 --> 19:15.484
Say your prayers, Gregory!

19:16.656 --> 19:18.487
I did it!

19:22.119 --> 19:24.906
It'd hurt if I whacked you
as hard as I can, after all.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.831
Wishful thinking. My body
is harder than even rock.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.455
You won't be able to win
against the Saiyans like that.

19:31.546 --> 19:35.789
Oh, yeah? Then again,
you've got a bump there.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.044
Ee-yow-w-w-w!

19:39.679 --> 19:42.716
There are still 118 days left.

19:42.807 --> 19:48.018
Knowing him, he might be
able to master the Kaio-ken!

19:50.523 --> 19:52.730
Kaio-ken, something I've dreamed about,

19:52.817 --> 19:55.934
but ended up never being able to master myself.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.770
And also, that other surefire technique.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.856
Kaio-sama, you promised.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.190
You may think you're ready for this,

20:02.285 --> 20:04.867
but my training is even
tougher than you can imagine!

20:04.954 --> 20:06.160
Can you withstand it?!

20:06.247 --> 20:08.203
Mm-hmm, I'll give it a try!

20:08.291 --> 20:09.531
As long as you're aspiring to be something,

20:09.625 --> 20:11.536
be the best in the universe!
The best under the heavens!

20:11.627 --> 20:15.870
Both in body, and in mind! Got it?

20:15.965 --> 20:17.501
You got it!

20:22.221 --> 20:25.884
Sis, I'd like you to tell
the fortune of the Earth.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.933
What's that? The future of Earth?

20:29.020 --> 20:32.228
I want to know what will happen next year.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.931
All right. I'll try divining it.

20:45.620 --> 20:50.705
It's no use. This time,
not even I can predict the future.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.871
Oh, dear.

20:51.959 --> 20:56.202
All right! That's it!
You're starting to control your Ki!

20:56.297 --> 20:58.208
Weak!

20:59.425 --> 21:04.385
Just what sort of technique is the Kaio-ken?

21:04.472 --> 21:07.214
And what is his other surefire technique?

21:09.435 --> 21:13.269
The time of the conflict was approaching,

21:13.356 --> 21:15.972
unrelentingly, moment by moment.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:34.603 --> 22:36.594
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:36.689 --> 22:39.351
Eh?! You were off by one day?!

22:39.442 --> 22:43.902
Then I ain't gonna make it back
when the Saiyans arrive, Kaio-sama!

22:43.988 --> 22:48.857
Hmm? What is that Ki?
Have they gotten here at last?

22:48.951 --> 22:50.816
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:50.911 --> 22:54.870
"Come Forth, Shen Long!
The Saiyans Finally Arrive on Earth. "

22:54.957 --> 22:58.415
I'll finally be able to see
you again, huh, Father?

22:59.305 --> 23:05.554
