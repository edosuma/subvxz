WEBVTT

00:13.805 --> 00:14.973
Hey.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.775
Hey, what's up, Brian?
Can I get a Bauhaus please?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.735
-Yep.
-Thank you.

00:27.945 --> 00:30.072
We're Campdogzz.

00:32.324 --> 00:34.409
Yeah!

02:54.549 --> 02:55.926
Hey, are you trying to do breakfast?

02:56.635 --> 03:00.305
Yeah. I could totally get breakfast.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.768
I want bacon!
And eggs.

03:04.851 --> 03:08.230
Um, here's the thing, though.
I'm a vegan.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.898
So if we can go somewhere
where I can eat, too,

03:09.981 --> 03:10.982
that would be awesome.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.651
Yeah.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.237
Oh, yeah.
I'm cool with that.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.531
I... I'm always thinking about...

03:18.532 --> 03:19.574
being vegan.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.079
Okay. Yeah, you just, like--
You don't-- See--

03:24.162 --> 03:26.206
I mean, every vegan goes through that.
I feel like--

03:26.289 --> 03:27.833
So you, like, know about veganism?

03:27.916 --> 03:30.710
Yeah, I'm, like, there in my head.

03:30.794 --> 03:35.716
Just gotta take what's in my head
and put it... on my plate.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.135
Oh, so you're like trying to be a vegan?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.470
'Cause if you're trying to be a vegan,
I could show you some shit,

03:40.554 --> 03:44.975
some, like, videos online
that will make you a vegan.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.853
Like, terrible, terrible shit
that will haunt your dreams.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.606
Like, NC-17 animals, you know?

03:51.690 --> 03:54.276
-Not like sex stuff, but like--
-That's-- I'm like--

03:54.359 --> 03:57.863
I know what it's gonna be,
and I'm not ready to see that.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.408
You would be transformed like Cinderella
into a vegan if you saw these videos.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.034
They are...

04:03.118 --> 04:06.496
I mean, I get it.
I don't need to see it to get it.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.041
You know, like, I already know.
It's just about breaking a habit, like...

04:10.125 --> 04:15.213
I don't need to see <i>Passion of the Christ</i>
to understand what happened to...

04:15.297 --> 04:17.007
the Christ. Like...

04:18.425 --> 04:19.801
I'm gonna pee.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.181
When you were, like, in eighth grade,

04:24.264 --> 04:26.850
did you get what you were gonna be
when you grow up?

04:26.933 --> 04:28.560
Uh, yeah.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.605
'Cause I'm still waiting on being
Mayor of San Francisco, you know?

04:31.730 --> 04:34.065
Living in Chicago might be
a deal-breaker for that one.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.734
Yeah, I don't think it works like that.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.111
-You wanted to be Mayor of San Francisco?
-I didn't want to be.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.322
That's what the class deemed me.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.449
-Oh, they picked it for you!
-In eighth grade.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.825
Okay.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.452
I think in kindergarten
I told, like, at my graduation

04:45.535 --> 04:48.455
that I wanted to be, like,
a garbage pickup foreman.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.374
-You had a kindergarten graduation?
-Yes, definitely.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.627
I'm saying
all of the wrong things.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.420
-I'm not, like, an alien.
-I know, I'm sorry. I know.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.547
-What is wrong?
-I know I'm treating you like you are.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.382
-You gotta let me get used to it.
-It's fine.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.760
First time with a vegan,
you gotta just let me...

05:03.011 --> 05:05.472
I feel like you're defining me
by being a vegan when, like...

05:05.555 --> 05:07.057
No! There's so many other things.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.309
...I also like to play catch outside.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.852
I don't know if that's
a defining characteristic.

05:10.936 --> 05:11.937
I don't even know what that means.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.230
-What do you mean?
-Just with balls?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.439
You've never played catch?

05:14.523 --> 05:16.399
Okay.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.486
I'm gonna tell you something that
I've literally never told anybody before.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.571
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.533
When I was younger,
and I swear, like, I was, like...

05:24.616 --> 05:26.993
six or seven,
so I didn't know what I was doing--

05:27.077 --> 05:28.870
I'm so curious what's about
to come out of your mouth.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.789
We had these, like, these--

05:30.872 --> 05:32.165
I don't even know
where we would find these.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.875
There would just be these giant frogs.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.168
I don't even know what to call them.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.420
They were big frogs,
like the size of my palm.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.298
And me and my uncles...

05:40.382 --> 05:42.384
would just, like...

05:42.467 --> 05:44.970
take the frogs
and we would toss them,

05:45.053 --> 05:46.596
and their bodies would just,
like, splatter.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.848
What? What?

05:49.975 --> 05:52.727
What?
You would just kill these frogs for fun?

05:52.811 --> 05:54.437
Yeah. 'Cause their bodies
were just, like, blah.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.189
And we were just, like, blah!

05:56.273 --> 05:57.357
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

05:57.440 --> 06:01.486
And then we would, like, dissect them
and, like, see their body parts.

06:03.655 --> 06:04.698
-And you think--
-Now you're judging me.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.533
-Yes, absolutely.
-I wanted to make it even,

06:06.616 --> 06:08.034
and I knew you were
gonna react like that,

06:08.118 --> 06:10.328
-so I had to make myself feel better.
-You made that up for me?

06:10.412 --> 06:11.788
I didn't make it up.
I wish I'd made it up.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.915
It's a really fucked up story, actually.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.293
-You never told anybody that?
-No, it's really bad.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.004
God, I'm feeling a mixed feelings
of horror and honor

06:19.087 --> 06:21.298
- for you telling me that.
- I know.

06:21.381 --> 06:26.136
I feel like you think I'm Gandhi,
and I still do not-great things.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.555
Well, you're Gandhi
and I'm a frog murderer, so...

06:38.064 --> 06:40.191
Text me. We'll bike.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.490
Did you just use the L-word?

06:47.574 --> 06:50.410
No, look, we were in the concert,
this crowd of people,

06:50.493 --> 06:53.705
and it's like, that's the person
I locked eyes with

06:53.788 --> 06:56.041
through all of these bodies?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.710
You know?
Like, outta, like... That's...

06:59.753 --> 07:02.297
-That is so cute.
-That's just how it happened,

07:02.380 --> 07:04.215
and if it sounds like love,
then it sounds like love.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.009
Oh, my God!

07:06.092 --> 07:07.093
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

07:07.177 --> 07:09.137
Do you have a minute to talk about,
uh, women's rights?

07:09.220 --> 07:10.639
Excuse me, miss.
Do you have a moment?

07:10.722 --> 07:12.307
-No, sorry.
-Please?

07:12.390 --> 07:14.392
-Just one signature from the neighborhood.
-Oh, yeah.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.394
That would be so great.
Thank you.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.939
What if I had texted you in the moment
that you were at that concert

07:19.022 --> 07:20.315
and you looked up
and saw your soul mate?

07:20.398 --> 07:22.901
Like, that would have sucked
if you read that text and you were, like,

07:22.984 --> 07:24.069
and you were reading about homework.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.946
Do you know how many people

07:26.029 --> 07:28.949
end up missing, like, "the one"
because they were texting?

07:29.032 --> 07:30.283
- Oh, my God.
- That is--

07:30.367 --> 07:32.577
Excuse me.
Can I have a second of your time?

07:32.661 --> 07:34.245
Sorry.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.748
To talk about
women's reproductive rights?

07:36.831 --> 07:40.752
We're trying to open up a center.
It's a center right across the street.

07:40.835 --> 07:45.715
I want to paint each other's nails
and, like, watch stupid romantic comedies,

07:45.799 --> 07:48.051
and drink mimosas, and...

07:48.134 --> 07:50.136
and, like, laugh and just...

07:50.220 --> 07:53.014
...have, like, a ladies thing, you know?

07:53.098 --> 07:55.642
-International Ladies Day.
-Yeah, we can do, like, a group text.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.435
Like, I could make a Facebook page.

07:57.519 --> 07:58.937
The government will not be paying
for the abortions.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.314
It'll be all donation-based
and non-profits.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.774
<i>What have we got in here?</i>
<i>The Temptations?</i>

08:02.857 --> 08:05.026
Please don't mess with my man.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.403
I love 'em.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.196
-How many signatures you got?
-I've got...

08:09.114 --> 08:11.282
-Uh... 24.
-Learn from the master.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.703
Oh, my God.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.622
That is so funny.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.875
Walter's story,
I think, has to do with masculinity,

08:20.959 --> 08:25.964
defined partly as somebody capable
of overt physical action

08:26.047 --> 08:27.424
and dominance

08:27.507 --> 08:31.011
with little regard to what we might call
the feminine virtues.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.391
Now, if you look at myth...
I'm going to the Greeks, okay?

08:36.474 --> 08:38.476
There are many doors
that you can go into,

08:38.560 --> 08:40.353
but I'm going to the Greeks.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.647
In this case, Walter White, Sr. can be...

08:42.731 --> 08:45.734
certainly be likened
to the god Hephaestus.

08:46.484 --> 08:49.487
Don't worry about it, but Hephaestus.

08:49.571 --> 08:52.407
Ernest Becker says this, it's lovely.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.576
"Man is out of nature."

08:55.493 --> 08:57.912
You're not really a part of nature,
are you?

08:57.996 --> 09:00.665
"And is hope--
And hopelessly in it."

09:00.749 --> 09:02.542
So you're like, "Uh...

09:02.625 --> 09:05.211
Man, me. Nature, meet."

09:05.295 --> 09:08.423
This is an old thing,
so he doesn't speak using "he or she."

09:08.548 --> 09:10.925
So just bear with.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.803
"He is dual, up in the stars

09:13.887 --> 09:20.560
and yet housed in the heart-pumping,
breath-gasping body

09:20.643 --> 09:22.437
that once belonged to a fish

09:22.520 --> 09:25.440
and still carries the gill marks
to prove it.

09:25.523 --> 09:30.528
His body is a material fleshly casing
that is alien to him in many ways."

09:35.116 --> 09:37.327
<i>- How you doing?</i>
<i>- Good. Um...</i>

09:37.410 --> 09:38.495
Questions? Anything?

09:38.578 --> 09:41.456
-Do you have a used bike section?
-We do. Yeah.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.666
Okay, I just want
something that's, like...

09:43.750 --> 09:46.419
worn in, like a little rough
around the edges.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.879
-Yeah.
-Um...

09:48.797 --> 09:52.050
I dunno. I told a friend that I ride
and I don't know why I did that.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.635
-So if you could just help me out.
-Well, we got those.

09:53.718 --> 09:54.719
We got those.
We got some used ones.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.096
-Here, let me show you what we got.
-Okay.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.056
I like you.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.618
Oh, God. Fuck. Shit.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.121
Okay.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.205
Okay.

10:43.518 --> 10:44.811
Oh.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.593
Like, when everyone was just, like,
going bare and bald,

11:16.676 --> 11:17.677
I was like, all right, cool.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.721
Like, if I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna go all the way.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.139
-So I lasered.
-Never did it.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.557
-You lasered?
-Yeah.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.726
-I thought you just wax.
-No.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.812
It was like a competition.
It's like, "Well, I shave." "Well, I wax."

11:27.896 --> 11:30.481
And I was like, "Well, fuck it, I laser."
And what?

11:30.565 --> 11:34.444
And now this is in, and I don't...
I don't even have the opportunity.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.072
First tattoo, that was during
a very religious phase.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.949
And then I became not religious.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.202
So sometimes it's like--
Sometimes I got attacked by a shark,

11:43.286 --> 11:45.663
other times, like,
I was on the back of a Harley

11:45.747 --> 11:47.081
and was pulled out from under.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.709
Wait, so you make up stories
about this tattoo?

11:49.792 --> 11:52.962
I mean, I'm not gonna tell people,
like, I believed in God and now I don't.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.505
Why not?
People go through that all the time.

11:54.589 --> 11:55.798
Oh, that's so deep.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.718
That, like...
You can't just throw that on people.

11:58.801 --> 11:59.928
That's not always the right--

12:00.011 --> 12:01.220
When you're, like, at a dinner

12:01.304 --> 12:05.308
and someone's trying to start conversation
by asking about your tattoo,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.602
the last thing you say
is, like...

12:07.685 --> 12:10.480
"Hey, I've lost all...

12:11.689 --> 12:14.359
faith and hope."

12:26.788 --> 12:28.289
Hey! I'm sorry.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.501
Did you ride your bike here? Huh?

12:32.293 --> 12:33.503
It's, like, 40 degrees outside.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.964
-You don't live close.
-It feels good. It feels, like, brisk.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.382
It feels good?

12:37.465 --> 12:39.092
Light jog.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.804
- Okay. I didn't know you like to...
- God.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.430
...go for long distance bike rides.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.265
It's not true.
I mentioned bike riding.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.392
Hey, how's it goin'?

12:47.475 --> 12:48.893
Can I start you off
with a drink or anything?

12:48.977 --> 12:51.771
Uh, can I have a vodka tonic
with double lime, please?

12:51.854 --> 12:54.399
Sure. Do you want another second
to look over the menu,

12:54.482 --> 12:56.109
-or do you kind of know what you want or--
-Um...

12:56.192 --> 12:57.735
I just-- I have a question.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.279
What is, uh--
Does pork salt have pork in it?

13:00.363 --> 13:02.573
Just big chunks of salt.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.866
- No pork.
- No pork.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.619
Can you see if you guys have
any vegan options?

13:06.703 --> 13:08.913
-Totally. Yeah, I will check on that--
-If it's not trouble.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.374
-No. Not at all. Not at all.
-Okay. Thank you.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.835
Are you a vegan?

13:13.918 --> 13:17.213
Yeah, I just-- You just specifically
asked if they had vegan options.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.633
I'm just making it more... easy for them.
Everything just, like--

13:20.717 --> 13:23.094
-For who?
-For the people in the kitchen.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.138
I don't wanna be
the difficult person at the table

13:25.221 --> 13:28.516
just 'cause I have, like,
dietary restrictions.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.560
You have dietary restrictions now?
So you're a vegan?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.603
Stop saying that.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.649
I mean, you guys have been
dating for a couple weeks and, like,

13:36.733 --> 13:40.820
you're spending a lot of time together,
and you're a vegan now, so--

13:40.903 --> 13:43.573
It's just, like, easier
when we go out to eat if we're ordering,

13:43.656 --> 13:46.868
like, from the same,
like, the same things.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.202
Like, it's just--

13:48.286 --> 13:51.622
You don't have to be
the same as the person that you're dating.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.958
-You guys can be--
-No. Compromise, though.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.002
-Compromise.
-Compromise.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.256
I'm just thinking about Jo,

14:00.339 --> 14:03.051
and about how
I don't know enough about her

14:03.134 --> 14:07.138
and about how I haven't met her yet,
which is a little strange to me.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.892
I don't think that should be strange.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.436
I don't think it should be something
you really think about like that.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.813
-Seriously?
-She's busy. A lot.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.523
She's been--
No. Stop smirking. I--

14:17.607 --> 14:18.608
What?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.651
I told you she, like,
does a lot of volunteer stuff.

14:20.735 --> 14:21.736
And that's awesome.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.489
She likes to spend her free time
helping people.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.823
I think International Ladies Day is--

14:25.907 --> 14:27.367
It's gonna be awkward
no matter what.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.035
Look, I'll be good. I'll...

14:29.118 --> 14:30.745
- "I'll be good."
- I will!

14:30.828 --> 14:32.205
I won't make her uncomfortable.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.248
-I'll make her feel welcome.
-Okay.

14:34.332 --> 14:37.168
Okay, I'll... I will have vegan snacks.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.461
-Okay.
-I won't make it weird.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.629
I won't make it weird, I promise.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.713
-Oh, it's not--
-I promise.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.715
It's not you.
It's not about you making it weird.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.966
Okay, so invite her.
It's a good time.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.594
-Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yes.
-She's a person who enjoys good times.

14:46.677 --> 14:47.762
-And she's a woman.
-Yeah.

14:47.845 --> 14:48.971
-Yes?
-Yeah.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.139
Do we hear that?
Everybody hear that?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.391
-Yeah.
-We have a yes.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.309
-Yeah.
-We have a yes.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.394
So down.

14:54.477 --> 14:55.478
<i>Hey!</i>

14:56.479 --> 14:59.357
- Hi.
- Hi!

14:59.440 --> 15:01.776
- Ooh, you good?
- Yep.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.778
-Look at this snow.
-How you doin'?

15:03.861 --> 15:04.946
First snow of the season.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.447
-How's it going?
-Good.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.783
Um, I thought you were bringing
your girls.

15:08.866 --> 15:12.662
Oh, um...
there was a birthday dinner.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.580
-No.
-Slipped my mind.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.582
-I know.
-Wait, so they're not coming at all?

15:16.666 --> 15:18.793
I don't think they're gonna
be done by then, but I'm here.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.503
-Fuck.
-I'm here to help you.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.256
Five dollars.
That's what I think.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.882
You can give
whatever you want, but--

15:24.966 --> 15:26.634
Thanks.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.094
Have a good night.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.638
Hi, everybody.
Um, I see a lot of familiar faces,

15:30.721 --> 15:33.808
but also, um, some new ones,
so I thought I'd just introduce myself.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.143
Um, I'm Jo.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.687
I put on this series
through Chicago Filmmakers,

15:37.812 --> 15:39.105
um, who, if you haven't checked out,

15:39.188 --> 15:41.607
they're an awesome organization,
so definitely check them out.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.610
Um, we're here
the first Thursday of every month,

15:44.694 --> 15:46.946
so please come back
and tell your friends.

15:47.029 --> 15:50.366
The series we're doing is,
um, all female filmmakers

15:50.450 --> 15:52.243
and we've been putting up
some great work.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.495
A lot of our--
A couple of our filmmakers are here,

15:54.579 --> 15:56.456
um, and you can talk to them after.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.583
We'll also have a Q and A
with this filmmaker.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.335
Um, and yeah,
we'll save all questions for after.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.296
So thank you for coming,
and please tell your friends.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.433
-Hi. Good to see you.
-Hey, what's up?

16:15.516 --> 16:17.935
-Yeah, good to see you.
-Oh, I'm so happy you came. Hi.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.104
Cheers. Thanks for coming, guys.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.482
-Thank you for having us.
-Yeah.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.234
Um...
I'm not really into film stuff.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.904
-I'm just here helping my girlfriend.
-Oh, okay.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.324
Yeah. I'm gonna just--
I'll be back.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.538
The cinematographer for that film
was, uh, a guy named Mike Fuelser.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.791
He's a former Chicagoan
who now teaches in Iowa.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.752
And we actually just did
a show with him...

16:42.835 --> 16:44.003
uh, him and Jesse MacLean,

16:44.086 --> 16:46.964
both former Chicagoans
who now teach in Iowa.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.716
And, um, yeah,
it was a really great show.

16:48.799 --> 16:52.845
Mike's stuff is mostly all
16-millimeter, experimental, silent.

16:52.929 --> 16:56.182
Premiered a new film
that's just mostly all color-field,

16:56.265 --> 16:57.808
um, but it's really good.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.561
And, uh, we got
the Onion City Film Festival comin' up,

17:00.645 --> 17:03.981
which is the experimental film
and video festival year end,

17:04.065 --> 17:06.651
and I really need to ask
Mike for any work...

17:19.288 --> 17:22.124
- That's a few days? In what world--
- It's Indian genes.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.710
You're lying 'cause you want to seem
more like a man, or something.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.170
Hi. Oh.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.632
-What's up?
-Uh...

17:29.715 --> 17:33.261
Uh, I'm not feeling the best,
so I think I'm gonna head home.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.305
-Really?
-Yeah. This was fun.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.308
Your friends are fucking awesome.
I want to do it again.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.476
-Did you have fun?
-But-- Yeah.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.562
My stomach just hurts
and I need to go.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.772
But this was cool.
I swear. Okay?

17:46.023 --> 17:47.316
-Are you sure?
-I'll see you tomorrow.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.236
Tomorrow's gonna be...
my first time.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.655
-It's gonna be great.
-Bye.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.453
Hi. Sorry.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.623
-Is she okay?
-She's not feeling well.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.593
<i>Can I get you anything?</i>

18:55.676 --> 18:58.554
Um, no.
No, I'm... I'm good.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.930
I just need to, like, rest up.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.933
I have to babysit later,
so I just need to sleep.

19:03.017 --> 19:04.810
Okay. Fair.
I have to go to this thing.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.355
But I will come back.
I'll come back.

19:07.438 --> 19:08.981
Do you want, like,
Gatorade, soup, anything?

19:09.065 --> 19:10.650
-Uh, I'll--
-What do you want? I gotcha.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.652
I'll text you
when I'm done babysitting.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.447
Gross.
Okay, get inside.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.823
-Okay.
-Bye. Stay warm.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.617
-And tell me what you need, okay?
-Yeah.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.160
Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.090
Pizza! I have pizza.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.800
What are you guys drawing?
What is that?

19:35.883 --> 19:38.511
I'm drawing a <i>Minecraft</i> sheep.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.137
Why is it a box?

19:40.221 --> 19:43.474
Um... it's <i>Minecraft.</i>

19:43.557 --> 19:45.726
All right, who wants the biggest slice?

19:45.810 --> 19:47.103
- Who has better grades?
- Me.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.604
- Me. I do.
- Yeah? That's what I thought.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.898
You have glasses, so of course,
naturally, you're smarter.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.192
Why can't you have pizza?

19:53.275 --> 19:54.402
Um...

19:55.778 --> 19:57.863
I'm doing this, like, new thing.

19:57.947 --> 20:02.326
The planet benefits
when we eat vegetables.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.162
'Cause this pizza you guys
are eating right now...

20:05.246 --> 20:07.081
I mean...

20:07.164 --> 20:11.711
Children had to be
taken from their mothers.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.713
Like, imagine if I just...

20:13.796 --> 20:15.756
when you guys were born,
I just took you.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.009
And then I just, like, kept...
like, raping your mother

20:19.093 --> 20:22.680
over and over and over and over again,
and then took her babies.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.558
They're mine.
And then I slaughter them.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.685
And their udders, like the cows,
their udders get these,

20:27.768 --> 20:29.812
like, disgusting infections,

20:29.895 --> 20:33.983
and their stomachs are, like, out to here
and we just milk 'em all day.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.568
You don't have boobs yet,
but when you do,

20:35.651 --> 20:37.278
the last thing you're gonna want
is someone just, like,

20:37.361 --> 20:40.114
milking them constantly, all day.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.774
- Hey.
- Oh, God.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.400
What's up?

21:58.484 --> 22:00.569
How was your ride?

22:00.653 --> 22:04.448
There's something...
Honestly, I feel anew.

22:04.532 --> 22:07.618
You know, riding my bike in the snow.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.329
It's like...
Just cleanses my soul.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.291
I just saw you get out of a car.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.085
-What?
-Right just a second ago.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.753
-No.
-Yeah.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.510
Uh...

22:25.636 --> 22:27.513
What are you doing?

22:34.019 --> 22:36.063
Oh, my God!

22:38.566 --> 22:41.735
I'm so sorry.
I totally forgot you were sick.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.071
I made up being sick.

22:44.154 --> 22:47.700
I'm throwing up because
I just ate an entire pepperoni pizza.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.995
Wait, why would you eat
an entire pepperoni pizza?

22:51.078 --> 22:53.038
'Cause I'm not vegan.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.331
I tried to be.

22:55.332 --> 22:58.544
Oh, babe.
I never asked you to be vegan.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.880
Here.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.634
All right.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.429
I'm sorry.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.932
You don't have to lie about being vegan.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.228
Or riding your bike.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.399
I kind of like the bike.

23:20.482 --> 23:23.444
I just don't like the vegan part.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.029
For me, not for you.

23:25.112 --> 23:29.408
Like, I know.
God, the animals and... and the pollution,

23:29.491 --> 23:31.910
and the drought
and the water and the--

23:31.994 --> 23:35.080
It's okay.
It's seriously okay.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.124
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.126
-I never asked you to do that.
-I want to. I just... I can't.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.420
-I never asked you to do that.
-I really, I want to. I can't do it.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.505
-That's okay. It's fine.
-I can't.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.050
It's okay.

23:46.133 --> 23:49.637
Can we just start over
and you can be you and I can be me,

23:49.720 --> 23:50.763
and I can do my thing,

23:50.846 --> 23:53.140
and you don't have to have
anything to do with it?

23:54.141 --> 23:55.309
Yeah.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.272
Can I have a kiss?

24:01.231 --> 24:02.399
Yeah.

24:05.569 --> 24:09.031
It's gonna take a good mouthwash
before I give you a kiss on the lips.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.282
I know.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.743
Okay.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.129
You know, this is nail polish.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.757
- Do you guys want mimosas?
- Yes!

24:26.840 --> 24:28.258
Okay, cool. On it.

24:28.342 --> 24:30.010
-Thank you.
-On it.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.805
So this...
Okay.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.099
-So it's like a narrative now.
-That's so gory.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.482
Um...

24:43.565 --> 24:44.858
What?

24:44.942 --> 24:46.652
-What? Are you nervous?
-No, shut up.

24:46.735 --> 24:47.820
-Are you nervous?
-Shut up.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.405
-Have some faith.
-Meh.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.576
Oh, my God,
this place is awesome.

24:54.660 --> 24:55.744
Hostess with the mostest.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.622
-Hello! Hi.
-Hi.

24:58.706 --> 24:59.998
-Is this Amber?
-Jo. Yes. You're Jo.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.251
I know... I know who you are.
Hello!

25:02.334 --> 25:04.670
-Hi. So nice to meet you.
-You're right, she's super cute.

25:04.753 --> 25:05.796
-I said you were--
-Hi. Um--

25:05.879 --> 25:07.881
-So you've been talkin' about me.
-Oh, like, a lot.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.675
-I talk about you, too.
-But mostly about you.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.510
Yeah, but I...
I've been wanting to meet you.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.137
-I've been asking.
-Good things?

25:13.220 --> 25:15.514
-Great things.
-Welcome to my place. Um...

25:15.597 --> 25:17.224
-Gorgeous. What a great place.
-We have food,

25:17.307 --> 25:21.562
and nail polish, and magazines
and all of our friends in one room.

25:21.645 --> 25:22.855
-Oh, God. Daunting.
