WEBVTT

00:24.357 --> 00:27.527
[Sandy] Good afternoon, everybody.
Thank you so much for coming.

00:28.445 --> 00:33.742
If you're wondering why we're doing this
in a, uh, nondenominational chapel

00:33.825 --> 00:35.785
instead of a synagogue
with a rabbi…

00:36.411 --> 00:39.748
[chuckles] …it's because Norman,
he wanted it that way.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.711
Just before he died, he said to me,

00:44.794 --> 00:49.299
"Sandy, you wanna stick me in a rowboat,
push it into the LA River,

00:49.382 --> 00:51.217
set it on fire, that's fine."

00:51.968 --> 00:54.637
"Just spare everybody
the religious claptrap."

00:54.721 --> 00:55.638
[chuckles]

00:57.515 --> 01:00.101
Religious claptrap.

01:01.686 --> 01:05.648
As you might guess, Norman belonged
to the reform school of Judaism.

01:07.692 --> 01:11.446
I've been trying to figure out how
to pay homage, uh, to this man.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.991
And then I remembered
one of his favorite sayings,

01:15.658 --> 01:18.244
"The truth is a good fallback position."

01:18.328 --> 01:22.874
[chuckles] So that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna fall back on the truth.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.630
[quivering] It was tough
being Norman's friend.

01:29.380 --> 01:32.884
But for over 50 years, that's what I was.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.639
Fifty years of him giving me a hard time

01:38.640 --> 01:42.227
about the women I dated,
the women I married,

01:43.228 --> 01:46.731
the divorces I suffered through,
the money I lost,

01:46.815 --> 01:48.274
money I never had,

01:49.317 --> 01:51.236
even the booze I drank.

01:52.529 --> 01:56.074
He found fault
in just about every aspect of my life.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.576
Homage, Dad. Pay homage.

01:58.660 --> 02:03.039
He lent me money when I was in trouble,
but he never let me forget it.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.833
No. No, no, no.

02:04.916 --> 02:08.002
My nose got rubbed in it
over and over again.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.631
When I went through
that whole cancer deal last year,

02:11.714 --> 02:13.967
I was scared out of my mind.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.388
My best friend, my good buddy,

02:19.597 --> 02:22.308
he kept joking
about how I should save my hair

02:22.392 --> 02:23.893
when it falls out

02:23.977 --> 02:26.396
and use it to make a tea cozy.

02:26.479 --> 02:27.438
[laughs]

02:27.522 --> 02:28.940
A tea cozy.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.985
Well, fuck you very much, good buddy.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.529
I didn't lose one strand. Not one.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.531
Not one.

02:37.657 --> 02:38.992
But I did lose you.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.745
And I don't know
how I'm gonna get through that.

02:42.829 --> 02:47.750
I-- I don't know how I'm just supposed
to go about my business without you.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.668
[sighs]

02:50.879 --> 02:52.672
And-- And for the record, you know,

02:52.755 --> 02:57.385
I did call the City of LA
about setting you on fire in a rowboat,

02:57.468 --> 03:01.556
but I couldn't get a permit
for a Viking funeral.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.894
[sniffs] You know,
maybe in Ventura County but not here.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.068
Thank you.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.657
I did not see that coming.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.869
[theme music playing]

03:27.123 --> 03:32.212
We are here today to mourn the passing
of my grandfather's meat body.

03:32.962 --> 03:38.426
But that decaying collection of cells
is not who or what he was.

03:39.219 --> 03:45.350
My grandfather was an immortal spirit
who has lived countless millions of lives.

03:45.934 --> 03:46.809
Scientology?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.978
[Robbie] And like all immortal spirits,

03:49.062 --> 03:53.399
he has roamed the universe
for eons in search of a game.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.652
For that is what we do.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.820
We play games.

03:57.904 --> 04:01.658
And the biggest game that we play
is to forget our true identity

04:01.741 --> 04:04.160
so that we can play hide-and-seek
with ourselves.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.913
And when the day comes
that we find ourselves,

04:06.996 --> 04:11.251
that we know with absolute certainty
that we are static awareness

04:11.334 --> 04:15.213
senior to matter, energy, space, and time,

04:15.922 --> 04:16.965
then we win.

04:17.048 --> 04:17.966
[sighs]

04:18.049 --> 04:22.637
I know that to be true for myself,
and now my grandpa knows it too.

04:23.513 --> 04:28.059
Although, without having crossed
LRH's bridge of total freedom,

04:28.601 --> 04:32.272
he will quickly be sucked back
into the hellish merry-go-round

04:32.355 --> 04:33.564
of birth and death.

04:35.066 --> 04:35.900
Thank you.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.532
My father never gave up on me.

04:43.574 --> 04:44.492
He should have,

04:46.202 --> 04:47.120
but he never did.

04:48.830 --> 04:54.210
Time after time, I let him down,
but he just refused to give up.

04:56.379 --> 05:00.466
So, as part of my amends to him,

05:00.550 --> 05:03.803
my sponsor and I decided
that I should pay him back

05:03.886 --> 05:06.597
for all the rehabs and therapists

05:06.681 --> 05:08.891
and wilderness retreats
that he sent me to.

05:09.892 --> 05:15.023
[sighs] Not counting inflation,
that came to a little over $900,000,

05:15.106 --> 05:17.859
and that doesn't include
the 300 grand in… in legal fees

05:17.942 --> 05:20.486
to… to beat
that bogus intent-to-sell bust.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.531
Like I would ever be stupid enough
to sell my own stash.

05:24.615 --> 05:28.202
Anyway, I owe my papa a million two.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.541
And I'm gonna use part of my inheritance
to pay him back.

05:33.624 --> 05:36.419
Well, not him, obviously,
because, you know.

05:37.587 --> 05:41.758
I am gonna pay him back
by building a drug rehab

05:43.259 --> 05:45.011
in the Galápagos Islands,

05:45.803 --> 05:49.057
where drug addicts and alcoholics

05:49.140 --> 05:53.311
and people with eating disorders
can turn their life around

05:53.394 --> 05:57.648
while learning
about Charles Darwin and evolution.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.566
Hmm.

05:58.649 --> 06:02.945
So, in honor of my father,
the man who never gave up on me, um,

06:03.029 --> 06:06.532
the rehab will be called
The Suite Surrender,

06:07.033 --> 06:11.579
because, in sobriety,
you have to surrender to win,

06:11.662 --> 06:15.124
and "suite" will be spelled S-U-I-T-E,

06:15.208 --> 06:18.836
because all the rooms will be
junior suites or better. Thank you.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.046
[sighs]

06:20.129 --> 06:22.507
When I lost my husband, I thought,

06:22.590 --> 06:24.300
"That's it. I'm alone now."

06:25.718 --> 06:28.846
[sighs] But miracle of miracles,
I ran into a man

06:29.514 --> 06:34.477
with whom I'd had a hot and heavy fling
way back in 1967.

06:35.103 --> 06:35.978
[chuckles]

06:36.062 --> 06:39.565
That man was your dad and your grandpa.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.069
Well, I mean, first we assumed that, uh,

06:43.152 --> 06:45.696
the relationship this time
would be merely platonic.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.242
You know, old friends holding hands,

06:49.742 --> 06:51.369
taking a walk in the park,

06:51.911 --> 06:53.329
sharing meals.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.832
But that's not what happened at all.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.836
With a little encouragement
from me and, uh,

07:01.087 --> 07:03.089
a little pharmaceutical assistance,

07:03.631 --> 07:08.719
Norman quickly turned into
the voracious stud that ravaged me

07:08.803 --> 07:10.179
all those years ago.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.140
It was wonderful.

07:12.807 --> 07:17.395
And his lust was gentle but demanding.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.938
And punctual.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.940
Oh, you could set your watch by it.

07:21.023 --> 07:21.941
[giggles]

07:22.608 --> 07:27.071
7:30 a.m. on Wednesdays and Sundays.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.992
After a cup of coffee and a quick visit
to the bathroom,

07:31.075 --> 07:36.038
he would take me from behind
and make me quiver and shake

07:36.122 --> 07:38.040
like a… like a 16-year-old girl

07:38.124 --> 07:42.378
who's been rebelling
against her overly religious parents.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.716
Wednesday and Sunday mornings,

07:47.758 --> 07:50.970
Norman Newlander loved me
like no other man.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.723
Wednesday and Sunday mornings.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.768
At 7:30 to 7:45.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.937
I'm a little horny right now.

08:03.232 --> 08:06.152
[crying] I was Norman's assistant

08:06.944 --> 08:08.613
for 22 years.

08:09.739 --> 08:14.285
I, um, arranged his work schedule,
his personal schedule,

08:14.368 --> 08:16.829
his travel plans, his vacations.

08:17.788 --> 08:22.376
I made sure he had
regular medical, dental…

08:23.044 --> 08:27.048
[sobbing] …dermatology, and ophthalmology.

08:28.090 --> 08:28.925
Um…

08:29.425 --> 08:31.010
I… [exhales]

08:31.093 --> 08:34.096
I-- I also took care of
all of his lunch and dinner reservations,

08:34.180 --> 08:38.100
always reminding the restaurants
how important he was

08:38.184 --> 08:40.019
so that he had a nice table.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.188
Classic Homo sapien.

08:42.939 --> 08:48.778
I also made sure his wife and daughter
got birthday cards and flowers.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.112
Same for Valentine's Day.

08:50.196 --> 08:54.033
And, um, eight times I made arrangements
for his daughter

08:54.116 --> 08:55.952
to go to the very best rehabs.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.037
[crying softly]

08:58.621 --> 09:00.456
But in-- [sighs]

09:00.540 --> 09:02.375
But in all that time…

09:05.336 --> 09:08.464
I never told Norman
how much he meant to me.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.970
[sobbing] How making him happy
made me happy.

09:14.053 --> 09:17.098
How… how his welfare
was my first thought in the morning

09:17.181 --> 09:19.684
and my last thought
before I went to sleep.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.520
[sobs] Um…

09:24.689 --> 09:25.731
Uh, thank you.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.070
-[screaming] No. No!
-[all gasp]

09:31.153 --> 09:33.030
[screaming] Don't leave me!

09:34.240 --> 09:36.576
I have so much more to give!

09:36.659 --> 09:39.161
-No!
-No, Jeanine. Jesus. Jeanine…

09:39.245 --> 09:40.538
What's she hanging onto?

09:44.417 --> 09:47.253
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

09:47.336 --> 09:49.755
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.049
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

09:52.133 --> 09:54.468
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.928
God, grant me the serenity…

09:56.012 --> 09:59.432
-Should we be worried about her?
-I'm more worried about him.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.439
He'll be okay. Just gotta give him time.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.149
-[sighs] I hope so.
-Yeah.

10:08.649 --> 10:11.193
A couple of years ago,
my… my best friend in the world

10:11.277 --> 10:12.778
passed away unexpectedly.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.988
Stevie Chartokoff.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.364
-I ever tell you about him?
-No.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.407
Great guy. Great guy.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.534
We were pals since, like, third grade.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.661
And I'll tell you, when he died,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.706
I didn't feel anything. I was numb.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.583
That's awful.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.084
No. [chuckles]

10:27.168 --> 10:30.838
See, that's the-- I think it's actually
a… a… a survival mechanism.

10:30.921 --> 10:34.884
It's like-- It's like nature's way
of being compassionate.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.010
What do you mean?

10:36.093 --> 10:38.095
Well, 'cause when it happened,

10:38.888 --> 10:41.682
I could-- The pain was too much.

10:41.766 --> 10:47.021
But over time, you know, I was able
to feel the grief more and more and more,

10:47.104 --> 10:50.358
till it just became, uh,
a part of who I am, you know?

10:50.441 --> 10:54.320
[splutters] It's like it morphs
into acceptance, which

10:55.237 --> 10:57.406
is, I guess, a sort of a wisdom.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.326
-That's actually pretty comforting.
-[chuckles]

11:01.243 --> 11:03.412
-You are wise.
-[chuckles]

11:04.246 --> 11:07.958
I remember one… one time in high school,
we must have been 14 or 15,

11:08.042 --> 11:12.838
me and Stevie smoked a joint, and we
decided to… to light our farts on fire.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.799
That's a real thing?

11:14.882 --> 11:17.843
Oh yeah. You lie on your back
with your legs up in the air,

11:17.927 --> 11:19.845
and you hold a lit match
in front of your ass.

11:19.929 --> 11:23.057
You let one rip,
and a big blue flame shoots out. [laughs]

11:23.140 --> 11:26.852
Anyway, somehow the pubes
on Stevie's balls caught fire,

11:26.936 --> 11:28.771
and he was screaming.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.773
He was crying and screaming
for me to pat it out.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.359
He said, "Pat it out! Pat it out!"
I'm not gonna touch his balls.

11:33.442 --> 11:34.777
So, long story short,

11:34.860 --> 11:38.280
his mother had to drive him
to the emergency room. [laughs]

11:38.364 --> 11:40.950
She did not wanna touch
those balls either. Trust me.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.662
So, your wisdom came later in life.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.497
It was after that. Yes.

11:52.920 --> 11:53.754
[sighs]

11:54.839 --> 11:56.298
[seagulls mewing]

11:56.382 --> 11:57.842
[Norman] Boy, what a deal.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.593
You're crazy not to get one.

11:59.677 --> 12:00.511
I'm okay.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.180
The churro is delicious.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.516
[smacking lips]

12:09.228 --> 12:10.855
I would like to say something.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.065
Can't I just enjoy this?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.567
No, you need to hear it.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.487
Sandy, I'm very grateful
for our friendship,

12:18.571 --> 12:22.199
and I want you to know how happy I am
to have you in my life.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.077
-[Robbie] How are you holding up?
-Hmm? What?

12:26.579 --> 12:28.956
Oh, I'm-- I'm fine, thank you.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.541
-Good.
-Mmm.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.631
You-- You need something?

12:38.799 --> 12:40.176
I just wanted to remind you

12:40.259 --> 12:43.804
that I am
a Flag-trained Class VIII Auditor,

12:43.888 --> 12:46.140
and I can help you process your grief.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.851
I don't need any help, but thank you.
[chuckles]

12:48.934 --> 12:52.563
Suppressed emotional pain can manifest
as a physical ailment.

12:52.646 --> 12:53.898
I'm fine, Robbie.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.816
[whispers]
Malignant tumors are not uncommon.

12:55.900 --> 13:01.113
Robbie, I'm glad Scientology
has helped you, uh, be all you can be.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.574
No, that's the Marines. Um…

13:03.657 --> 13:05.910
Either way, just leave me the fuck alone.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.578
Okay, see, that's anger,

13:07.661 --> 13:09.747
which is a little higher
on the emotional tone scale--

13:09.830 --> 13:10.664
Beat it!

13:16.754 --> 13:17.588
[glass thuds]

13:18.088 --> 13:18.923
[sighs]

13:24.720 --> 13:28.098
I remember my first biopsy.
It's very unpleasant.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.309
Scissors up your asshole,
that's never good.

13:30.392 --> 13:33.604
Yeah. At least afterwards,
when there's blood in your stool,

13:34.188 --> 13:35.940
you know where it's coming from.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.942
Always a joy.

13:38.567 --> 13:39.652
Anything else?

13:40.903 --> 13:41.737
Yes.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.157
In your professional opinion,
what is your finest ham?

13:45.991 --> 13:49.620
-I don't know. They're all good.
-All right, let's put it in story form.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.748
It's your last meal
before you're executed by the state.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.959
What ham do you add
to your turkey sandwich

13:55.042 --> 13:57.920
before they inject you
with a cocktail of death?

13:59.839 --> 14:00.756
Honey glazed.

14:01.715 --> 14:05.052
Mr. Deli Man,
a half a pound of honey glazed, please.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.140
I would've bet a million bucks
he would've said Virginia ham.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.351
[Madelyn] He was a wonderful man.

14:13.602 --> 14:14.436
Oh…

14:14.520 --> 14:15.729
Yeah, he was the best.

14:15.813 --> 14:16.647
Hmm.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.066
The cat's pajamas. [chuckles]

14:19.149 --> 14:20.693
The bee's knees.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.155
You know,
we were talking about getting married.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.492
No, I didn't know that. I'm so sorry.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.704
There was also talk
about us having a baby.

14:31.787 --> 14:32.746
[laughs]

14:33.706 --> 14:34.540
Yeah.

14:34.623 --> 14:35.666
What's so funny?

14:37.543 --> 14:38.460
You're serious?

14:39.044 --> 14:40.379
As a heart attack.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.966
Oh, okay.

14:47.928 --> 14:51.265
Now, when you say "having a baby,"
you mean, like, adopting?

14:51.432 --> 14:53.684
No, I mean, like, having a baby.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.314
Right. Right.

14:58.397 --> 15:02.234
Of course, we had to put it on hold
until I was off my medication.

15:02.318 --> 15:05.154
We didn't want Norman Jr.
having three heads and a tail. [laughs]

15:05.237 --> 15:07.489
[chuckles] No. No, we wouldn't, no.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.536
I don't mean to pry,

15:12.620 --> 15:15.539
but what kind of medications
are we talking about?

15:15.623 --> 15:17.499
-For depression.
-Oh yeah.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.169
-And bipolar.
-Mmm, that too, huh?

15:20.252 --> 15:21.754
And a little schizophrenia.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.797
Wow. That's… that's the hat trick.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.675
-Excuse me?
-[splutters] Ignore me.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.510
I'm just fraught with grief.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.226
In the meantime,
you're a beautiful, vivacious woman.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.813
And I'm sure you'll meet someone special,
and you'll have that baby.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.357
What are you suggesting?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.526
Nothing. I'm just wishing you the best.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.195
Please tell me you're not coming on to me

15:46.278 --> 15:48.864
when the second love of my life
is still warm to the touch.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.115
No! No, of course not!

15:50.199 --> 15:53.661
I don't feel safe right now.
I am going to walk away.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.081
Keep walking.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.707
Jesus Christ.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.171
[Norman] When I was going
through the whole prostate deal,

16:04.254 --> 16:07.383
I convinced myself
I could turn things around by Kegeling.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.218
-Well, did it help?
-No.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.805
But it gave my anus confidence,
and that's half the battle.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.561
-Are you doing it now?
-[straining] Yeah.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.730
I'll join you.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.026
-[squealing]
-[chuckles]

16:27.069 --> 16:29.571
-What, is that-- That's your Kegel sound?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.491
-Hey.
-Now what?

16:32.574 --> 16:34.702
I was just coming
to see if you're ready to go.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.120
-Oh yeah.
-Come on.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.248
-Did you see they got sushi from Nobu?
-Mmm.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.165
Yeah.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.002
This is unbelievable.
He's got baked crab and miso cod

16:43.085 --> 16:45.004
and yellowtail, the whole deal.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.463
-That's nice.
-[chuckles]

16:46.964 --> 16:49.258
Nobody knows how
to mourn like the Jews, huh?

16:49.341 --> 16:51.260
Practice, practice, practice.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.636
-[door opens]
-[chuckles] Yeah.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.400
-Thanks for driving.
-[Martin] Hey, happy to do it.

17:06.483 --> 17:10.112
Well, you know,
not… not happy, but, you… you know.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.532
I wish you'd reconsider.
We have plenty of room.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.701
I'm fine, honey.

17:15.784 --> 17:19.246
Yeah, of course you're fine.
It's just, why be alone right now?

17:19.329 --> 17:20.664
'Cause that's what I want.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.333
Come on, spend the night. It'll be fun.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.669
We'll have, like,
a… a… a family game night.

17:26.253 --> 17:29.173
Martin, I just lost my best friend.
I don't wanna have fun.

17:29.757 --> 17:30.591
You sure?

17:31.091 --> 17:33.635
We could smoke a doobie,
play a little Jenga.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.803
I'll pass.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.181
I hate when you use that word.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.184
What, "doobie"?
What's the matter with "doobie"?

17:40.684 --> 17:42.269
Makes you sound like an old man.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.562
He is an old man.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.688
Don't help.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.192
-All right. We'll take you home.
-[Sandy] Yeah.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.614
You know, I wasn't gonna say anything, but

17:53.697 --> 17:57.034
when we were trying to drag that girl
off the coffin, she bit me.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.912
What? That's terrible. Let me see.

17:59.995 --> 18:03.123
Yeah. Didn't break the skin
but still hurts like the dickens.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.542
The dickens?

18:06.043 --> 18:08.253
Okay, "dickens" and "doobie." Got it.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.421
[chuckles]

18:11.757 --> 18:12.591
[sighs]

18:15.969 --> 18:18.347
It was a pretty nice turnout,
I thought, huh?

18:18.430 --> 18:20.265
Norman would have been pleased.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.476
Norman was never pleased.

18:22.559 --> 18:25.896
[chuckles] Yeah, well, he wa…
he was certainly tough on you, huh?

18:27.523 --> 18:28.565
What are you talking about?

18:28.649 --> 18:31.193
In your eulogy,
you were saying how he was tough on you.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.319
That's not what I said.

18:33.654 --> 18:37.032
-I'm pretty sure that's what you said.
-We were tough on each other.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.743
-Okay.
-That's just how we were.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.204
-[Martin] Right.
-Don't be telling me what I said.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.748
Got it, sorry. My bad.

18:44.832 --> 18:45.707
[chuckles]

18:47.084 --> 18:50.170
-What?
-No one says "my bad" anymore.

18:51.213 --> 18:54.258
Well, excuse me.
I didn't get the fucking memo.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.594
-Take it easy.
-Okay.

18:59.138 --> 18:59.972
Memo.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.599
["It Never Entered My Mind" playing]

19:06.145 --> 19:07.187
[lock clicks]

20:01.491 --> 20:02.367
[music continues]

20:08.916 --> 20:09.750
Thanks.

20:13.003 --> 20:13.921
[sighs]

20:23.931 --> 20:25.224
-[music ends]
-[glass clinks]

20:25.307 --> 20:29.394
Jack Daniel's and Diet Dr. Pepper.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.479
Thank you, Alex.

20:30.979 --> 20:34.775
I was very sorry
to hear about Mr. Newlander.

20:35.692 --> 20:36.526
Yeah.

20:37.027 --> 20:40.822
[Alex] I had the bar make a martini
in his honor.

20:44.117 --> 20:44.952
Thank you.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.330
He was a kind and generous man.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.249
Yeah, I'll give you generous.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.166
Yeah.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.961
I'll be back in a moment
to take your order.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.676
[sighs]

21:04.930 --> 21:05.847
[exhales]

21:13.939 --> 21:15.023
Cheers, buddy.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.508
[woman shouting] Irving!

21:43.385 --> 21:44.720
Irving!

21:45.846 --> 21:47.014
-Irving!
-What?

21:50.475 --> 21:51.310
Oh.

21:55.355 --> 21:56.565
[woman shouting] Irving!

21:57.065 --> 21:58.191
[Sandy] Hello!

22:00.527 --> 22:02.487
I think I found your dog.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.865
-Hello?
-[in Russian accent] Oh, thanks God.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.408
Thank you so much.

22:06.992 --> 22:07.868
Oh, no problem.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.745
I was freaking the fuck out.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.082
-[sighs]
-His name is Irving?

22:14.166 --> 22:17.002
Yeah. The gate was left open,
and he just took off.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.546
-Really?
-[woman sighs]

22:19.629 --> 22:20.589
Irving.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.174
Yeah. Why?

22:27.262 --> 22:28.513
It's-- It's not important.

22:28.597 --> 22:31.475
You just-- You don't hear
that name much anymore.

22:32.976 --> 22:35.312
Let me get my pocketbook.
I'm gonna give you a reward.

22:35.395 --> 22:36.813
Ooh, no. No, no, no, no.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.775
-I'm just-- I'm being a good neighbor.
-[woman chuckles]

22:41.568 --> 22:42.736
You're a great neighbor.

22:44.946 --> 22:45.781
[chuckles]

22:46.573 --> 22:48.742
-Yvette.
-Sandy.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.454
Uh, I live, uh, down the street
on the corner.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.581
-Uh, the one that's for sale?
-Mmm.

22:54.664 --> 22:55.499
Did you buy it?

22:55.582 --> 22:58.418
No. It's a 3,000-square-foot hole of shit.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.087
-[chuckles]
-Shithole.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.964
Yeah. I'm house-sitting
for my cousin and her husband.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.258
Oh, that… that… that's nice.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.344
If I lost their dog,
I don't know what I would do.

23:07.427 --> 23:11.223
I would have to jump off the balcony
and hope the coyotes eat me. [laughs]

23:11.306 --> 23:13.642
Yeah. They'd be crazy not to.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.937
[sighs] Okay.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.315
Uh, good night. Good night.

23:23.402 --> 23:27.864
Can I at least offer you a glass of wine?
Or I make a mean margarita.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.075
Something to say thank you.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.746
[Sandy grunting] Aha! Ah!

23:35.455 --> 23:36.873
Ah, thank you.

23:37.624 --> 23:38.917
You were showing off.

23:39.584 --> 23:40.961
-Yeah.
-[sips]

23:41.795 --> 23:43.380
Hey, look what I can do.

23:43.463 --> 23:44.339
[Sandy] Yeah.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.175
[sips] Did you think I wouldn't know
how old you are?

23:47.259 --> 23:49.886
[huffs] Yeah.

23:49.970 --> 23:53.140
It's not enough to act your age.
You also have to fuck your age.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.057
[sighs]

23:55.016 --> 23:55.851
Yeah.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.728
I'm gonna get you more vegetables.

24:01.731 --> 24:03.483
-[exhales]
-[dog barks]

24:07.320 --> 24:08.655
[whispers] Norman, is that you?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.492
Oh.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.538
-[doorbell chiming]
-[Sandy groaning]

24:21.793 --> 24:22.669
[grunts]

24:24.045 --> 24:24.963
Good morning.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.090
What's happening?

24:27.757 --> 24:30.760
Your lovely daughter sent me over
with healthy fruit smoothies.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.512
Aw, that's… that's nice.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.432
I don't have to tell you
she's worried about her old pop.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.975
[dog barks, growls]

24:39.519 --> 24:40.353
He's okay.

24:40.437 --> 24:41.605
[grunts]

24:41.688 --> 24:42.898
He's okay.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.610
-Who's this?
-This is Irving.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.611
Irving.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.404
Hi. Hi.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.199
I have a half a Vicodin
if your back still hurts.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.160
Oh! Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest.

24:57.954 --> 24:59.623
-Here.
-What?

25:00.332 --> 25:02.375
-Cover.
-[Yvette] Oh, sure.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.336
Uh, Martin, this is Yvette.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.379
Yvette, this is Martin.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.673
-Hello.
-Hello.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.009
-Russki?
-Da.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.970
-[chuckles]
-Uh, I go to use your shower?

25:14.054 --> 25:15.972
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay. Come, Irving.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.224
Uh…

25:17.307 --> 25:18.308
[chuckles]

25:18.391 --> 25:19.267
Dosvedanya!

25:21.770 --> 25:23.230
-[Sandy gulps]
-[pills rattle]

25:23.772 --> 25:25.148
-[sighs]
-Holy shit!

25:25.232 --> 25:26.191
Yeah.

25:26.274 --> 25:27.567
How does that happen?

25:27.651 --> 25:29.486
I mean, I drop you off here last night,

25:29.569 --> 25:31.530
I was afraid you'd stick your head
in the oven.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.114
Well, I stuck my head in something.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.909
Again, how does that happen?

25:35.992 --> 25:38.745
Tell me. Tell me everything. And go slow.

25:38.828 --> 25:40.580
There's nothing to tell.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.749
Well, no, no, there… there is something.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.378
Her dog's name is Irving.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.130
I understand. You… you introduced us.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.008
That's Norman's middle name.

25:52.592 --> 25:53.510
All right. So?

25:53.593 --> 25:55.303
So it's spooky, right?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.389
Is it? Maybe it's just a coincidence.

25:57.472 --> 25:59.933
Only the same day
that I bury my best friend,

26:00.016 --> 26:04.312
this beautiful young woman comes
into my life with a dog that has his name?

26:04.396 --> 26:05.730
Middle. Middle name.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.066
At best it's like a Stephen King novella.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.652
See, I was thinking
maybe like Twilight Zone.

26:10.735 --> 26:14.406
-Yeah. Maybe. It's a stretch.
-[grunting]

26:14.489 --> 26:16.157
Speaking of which,
when you hurt your back,

26:16.241 --> 26:19.286
what were you doing? You were thrusting?
You were lifting? Tell me, tell me.

26:19.369 --> 26:20.912
Use your imagination.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.540
See, I am, but it's not what it once was.

26:23.623 --> 26:27.127
-Don't say anything about this to Mindy.
-Mindy who? Finish your story.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.129
-Oh. Yeah, the dog.
-Irving.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.840
So it's actually not her dog.
She's house-sitting.

26:31.923 --> 26:35.468
Long story short, he got out,
I found him, and, uh, she thanked me.

26:36.219 --> 26:37.596
[chuckles]

26:38.597 --> 26:40.390
Did you say "you're welcome"?

26:41.766 --> 26:42.809
In my way.

26:43.685 --> 26:44.769
What does she do?

26:44.853 --> 26:45.854
I don't know.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.147
What's her last name?

26:47.230 --> 26:48.690
I don't know.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.319
What does she want
with an alte kaker like you?

26:52.402 --> 26:54.779
Well, actually, that's something
that I do know.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.158
A lot of young women are attracted
to older men

26:58.241 --> 27:00.577
because we're, uh…
we're more sophisticated,

27:00.660 --> 27:02.829
more worldly than guys their own age.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.497
-So you don't know.
-I don't know.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.961
I will tell you one thing, there's more
going on here than just a coincidence.

27:10.545 --> 27:13.506
Really? Like what?
A… a message from beyond?

27:13.590 --> 27:14.674
No, I don't know.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.051
Maybe.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.886
Aha? Okay, what--

27:17.969 --> 27:21.181
I can't believe I'm asking you this.
What would that be?

27:21.765 --> 27:23.266
I'm not sure. Um…

27:23.350 --> 27:27.979
Embrace life,
keep my heart open to new experiences.

27:28.563 --> 27:30.649
Sandy, we have a problem. Come quick.

27:34.569 --> 27:36.738
[in Russian accent]
Boris, we must kill squirrel.

27:38.698 --> 27:39.658
[slurps]

27:39.741 --> 27:40.992
Fuck!

27:41.493 --> 27:42.410
Fuck! Ah!

27:42.494 --> 27:44.120
-What? What? What? What happened?
-Fuck!

27:44.204 --> 27:45.705
-Fuck!
-[Martin] What happened?

27:45.789 --> 27:47.332
Irving took a shit in my bed.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.418
Keep an open heart.

28:00.762 --> 28:01.596
[tires screech]

28:17.529 --> 28:18.571
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:19.322 --> 28:22.158
-Thanks for the smoothie. [grunts]
-You're welcome.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.952
-[groans]
-What's going on with your back?

28:24.035 --> 28:28.123
Oh, I just tweaked it putting on my socks,
if you can believe it, you know.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.374
You're kidding.

28:29.457 --> 28:32.502
I think it's time
to get one of those, uh, plastic thingies

28:32.585 --> 28:33.753
that put 'em on for you.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.172
[chuckles] That is so sad.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.549
Tell me about it.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.220
You know, if you ever want to talk
about what you're going through,

28:42.303 --> 28:43.471
I'm here for you.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.306
What do you think I'm going through?

28:45.890 --> 28:48.727
You lose somebody
that's been such a big part of your life,

28:48.810 --> 28:51.688
there's got to be lots of feelings,
emotions.

28:51.771 --> 28:53.732
Ugh. Not as many as you'd think.

28:53.815 --> 28:54.733
Dad…

28:55.233 --> 28:58.737
You know how many of my friends have died
in the last couple of years?

28:59.237 --> 29:01.406
-No.
-Me neither. I've lost count.

29:01.489 --> 29:04.409
Well, still, it's important that you talk
to somebody about it.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.619
Why? Who says we have
to share how we feel

29:06.703 --> 29:09.122
about every fucking thing
that happens to you?

29:09.205 --> 29:11.750
'Cause keeping it inside is not healthy.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.960
Yeah, well,
maybe I don't want to be healthy.

29:14.043 --> 29:15.211
Oh, very mature.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.672
Mindy, I am 75 years old.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.425
I think that gives me
certain rights and privileges

29:20.508 --> 29:22.427
as to what constitutes maturity.

29:22.510 --> 29:23.845
No, it doesn't.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.138
Says you.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.266
[sighs]

29:32.312 --> 29:33.646
[phone unlocks, beeps]

29:37.192 --> 29:38.860
Martin, when you saw
my father this morning,

29:38.943 --> 29:40.695
did he say anything about Norman?

29:42.405 --> 29:44.449
I don't know. Did he open up to you?

29:45.033 --> 29:46.618
Was he acting weird at all?

29:48.495 --> 29:49.621
Why are you giggling?

29:50.121 --> 29:53.500
So we do these exercises
to free up our emotions,

29:53.583 --> 29:57.712
because all our lives we've been taught
that some of them are not acceptable

29:57.796 --> 29:59.631
and thus need to be suppressed.

30:00.173 --> 30:01.466
For instance, uh, men,

30:01.549 --> 30:06.137
they learn at an early age,
usually in a playground, to not show fear.

30:06.221 --> 30:09.057
And if you do, you're weak. You're a punk.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.268
And for women,
the message you get over and over again

30:12.352 --> 30:14.854
is that it's not ladylike
to express anger.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.023
You're immediately labeled a bitch

30:17.106 --> 30:19.317
if you have a strong opinion
about something,

30:19.400 --> 30:22.529
or, God forbid, you raise your voice.

30:24.531 --> 30:28.618
But what kind of an actor can you be
if those emotions are denied to you?

30:29.536 --> 30:31.204
And not just anger and fear.

30:31.287 --> 30:34.707
What about, uh, apathy? Exhilaration?

30:34.791 --> 30:37.585
Murderous rage? Abject grief?

30:38.253 --> 30:40.046
-Yes.
-How do I get an agent?

30:41.673 --> 30:42.507
[sighs] What?

30:42.590 --> 30:46.219
If I don't have an agent,
I can't audition, and if I can't audition,

30:46.302 --> 30:48.847
what the fuck difference does it make
if I got suppressed emotions?

30:48.930 --> 30:50.932
I'm guessing you don't have
a problem with anger.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.475
No, I do not.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.894
Well,
you'll make somebody a great ex-wife.

30:55.478 --> 30:58.064
What do you say we just stick
with the emotion exercise

30:58.147 --> 30:59.190
for the time being?

31:00.066 --> 31:01.651
Anybody want to give it a try?

31:02.652 --> 31:05.488
I have a manager,
but I really don't know what he does.

31:06.072 --> 31:07.907
I mean, I know what he's supposed to do.

31:08.491 --> 31:12.287
He's supposed to network with producers
and directors and get me work.

31:12.912 --> 31:15.206
But I think he
mostly just sells them cocaine.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.541
There's grief.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.960
Anybody want to do the exercise?

31:19.043 --> 31:20.628
You're lucky your guy slings dope.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.381
Mine's always trying
to take pictures of me in his Jacuzzi.

31:23.464 --> 31:24.591
And we're back to anger.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.051
-Are you with Arnie Breedlove?
-Yeah.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.762
Me too. He sells those, you know?
You should get a commission.

31:29.846 --> 31:30.889
Oh, dear God.

31:30.972 --> 31:31.890
That fucker!

31:32.515 --> 31:33.808
I should just kill him.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.019
Drown him in his Jacuzzi.

31:36.102 --> 31:37.812
That would be poetry justice.

31:37.896 --> 31:38.813
[both laugh]

31:38.897 --> 31:42.108
Poetic. It's poetic justice.

31:42.191 --> 31:44.068
And let's not be killing anybody, hmm?

31:44.152 --> 31:46.988
-She'd make it look like an accident.
-[Sandy] No, no.

31:47.071 --> 31:50.366
Look, I understand your frustration.
I-- I have been there.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.578
And for what it's worth,
I was planning on having a friend of mine

31:53.661 --> 31:55.872
come here to speak
with you on this very subject.

31:55.955 --> 31:57.165
Is he an agent?

31:57.749 --> 31:58.708
He was an agent.

31:58.791 --> 32:00.752
-What is he now?
-Dead.

32:00.835 --> 32:03.004
[clicks tongue] I can't catch a break.

32:03.087 --> 32:07.592
Okay, I promise we'll discuss
the agent situation at a later date.

32:07.675 --> 32:10.595
But for now, acting exercises,

32:10.678 --> 32:13.056
freeing up suppressed emotions.
Who wants to--

32:13.139 --> 32:16.267
What happens
when you feel something so deeply,

32:16.351 --> 32:18.853
so powerfully,
you're afraid to express it?

32:19.437 --> 32:22.565
Feelings can't hurt you, Mindy.

32:22.649 --> 32:26.569
Sometimes it seems like they can,
but the truth is they can't.

32:27.362 --> 32:30.782
-So there is nothing to be afraid of.
-Good to know.

32:30.865 --> 32:31.866
[inhales deeply]

32:31.950 --> 32:34.285
Okay. Who wants to give it a go?

32:34.369 --> 32:36.204
-I will.
-Okay, Jude!

32:38.373 --> 32:40.166
Okay, what emotion
do you want to work with?

32:40.249 --> 32:42.335
Um… grief?

32:42.418 --> 32:43.544
Good choice.

32:45.755 --> 32:48.508
There's several techniques
to help express grief.

32:48.591 --> 32:50.051
One of the simplest

32:50.134 --> 32:53.221
is to think about something that happened
in your life that made you sad…

32:53.304 --> 32:54.138
Mmm.

32:54.222 --> 32:57.767
…and then you just let those feelings
come out in your performance.

32:57.850 --> 33:00.103
Is there something
that made you sad recently?

33:00.186 --> 33:02.105
You made your point, Mindy. Okay?

33:02.188 --> 33:03.022
Leave it alone!

33:05.400 --> 33:06.567
Jude, you wanna try?

33:06.651 --> 33:07.485
Yeah, sure.

33:09.487 --> 33:10.697
Whenever you're ready.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.408
[breathes deeply]

33:15.785 --> 33:16.911
[inhales deeply]

33:19.080 --> 33:20.456
[sighs sharply]

33:21.332 --> 33:22.792
[Sandy] Tell me what's happening.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.837
[quivering]
I'm remembering a real sad thing.

33:27.505 --> 33:28.339
[Sandy] Okay.

33:28.881 --> 33:31.009
All right.
Just stay with it. Stay with it.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.052
[crying] Oh, God.

33:34.095 --> 33:35.221
You're doing great.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.305
[crying]

33:36.889 --> 33:37.974
[sniffles]

33:38.057 --> 33:41.644
This is, like… it's really upsetting.

33:43.479 --> 33:45.606
Can you tell us what the memory is?

33:48.943 --> 33:52.488
I let Arnie Breedlove
take pictures of me in his Jacuzzi.

33:52.572 --> 33:53.823
[sobbing]

33:53.906 --> 33:56.159
["Zombie" by Fela Kuti playing]

34:02.874 --> 34:04.000
[music continues]

34:10.548 --> 34:12.467
Oh, Robbie, what are you doing?

34:12.967 --> 34:13.885
[knocking at door]

34:14.427 --> 34:15.261
[sighs]

34:16.054 --> 34:16.929
[grunts]

34:20.099 --> 34:21.267
Oh! Hi.

34:21.350 --> 34:23.644
I bought you new sheets,
a blanket, and a duvet.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.188
You didn't have to do that.

34:25.271 --> 34:27.523
Yes, I did. Okay, goodbye.

34:27.607 --> 34:28.691
Uh, wait, wait.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.819
Don't you want to, you know, hang out?

34:34.155 --> 34:36.991
First time I thank you
for finding him is free.

34:37.658 --> 34:38.493
[inhales]

34:38.576 --> 34:40.036
Second time is $2,000.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.163
Oh.

34:42.663 --> 34:44.749
Of course, you know, that's fine.

34:44.832 --> 34:47.293
[inhales] Uh, let me just, uh…

34:47.376 --> 34:48.461
Oh! [grunts]

34:50.421 --> 34:51.339
[exhales]

34:54.050 --> 34:55.093
Goodbye, Irving.

34:55.676 --> 34:57.512
-[whimpers]
-I'm gonna miss you.

35:03.017 --> 35:03.851
Bye.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.270
-[footsteps receding]
-Come on, Irving.

35:06.813 --> 35:07.647
[sighs]

35:08.147 --> 35:08.981
Bye-bye.

35:12.026 --> 35:12.985
Two grand?

35:13.069 --> 35:14.028
Holy shit!

35:14.112 --> 35:15.530
["Zombie" continues playing]
