WEBVTT

00:07.850 --> 00:10.010
This is President Jeffrey Michener

00:10.710 --> 00:12.110
addressing all Americans

00:12.110 --> 00:15.270
from the navy ship the USS Nathan James,

00:15.460 --> 00:17.880
which is now entering the heart of this great nation,

00:17.930 --> 00:19.380
the Mississippi River.

00:22.730 --> 00:27.530
We are survivors of this great plague, just as you are.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.750
We have struggled, just as you have,

00:31.000 --> 00:34.850
and we still have great hope in the future, just as you do.

00:34.890 --> 00:37.080
Court! Court, look!

00:37.080 --> 00:39.200
I know that you've stayed alive this long

00:39.200 --> 00:40.960
- by isolating yourselves... - What you got, baby?

00:41.060 --> 00:42.380
...and your families,

00:42.400 --> 00:44.540
that many of you have been living in fear,

00:44.980 --> 00:47.330
fear of the virus, fear of each other...

00:47.560 --> 00:49.130
Sonia, come listen to this!

00:49.130 --> 00:50.440
...fear of the unknown.

00:50.630 --> 00:52.180
There have been people out there

00:52.320 --> 00:54.150
who have taken advantage of that.

00:54.300 --> 00:57.500
Despicable rumors and misleading videos

00:57.670 --> 00:59.720
have been broadcast from this network,

00:59.820 --> 01:02.500
lies designed to manipulate you,

01:02.680 --> 01:04.450
to make you believe that this ship

01:04.530 --> 01:06.750
and the people on it are your enemy.

01:07.300 --> 01:09.590
Nothing could be further from the truth.

01:12.490 --> 01:13.780
The men and women on this ship are

01:13.790 --> 01:16.710
some of the bravest, noblest that I have ever met,

01:17.360 --> 01:18.430
and it is an outrage

01:18.430 --> 01:20.690
that their commitment to bring all of us the cure

01:20.700 --> 01:23.760
has been undermined by those who thrive on your fear.

01:24.800 --> 01:28.310
I can tell you now that we do have the cure for the red flu.

01:29.410 --> 01:32.000
Attached to this message is video footage

01:32.000 --> 01:33.580
where you can see for yourself

01:33.660 --> 01:37.790
our doctor attending and curing patients sick with the virus.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.570
It is our mission now to spread this cure

01:40.570 --> 01:42.630
to as many of you as we can.

01:43.620 --> 01:46.140
At noon tomorrow, the 18th,

01:46.340 --> 01:49.020
we expect to land at the docks in Vicksburg,

01:49.270 --> 01:52.420
where we will remain in port for six hours.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.080
On the 20th, we'll arrive in Tennessee.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.690
We have made contact with a few brave citizens

01:57.690 --> 01:59.220
at the College of Memphis.

01:59.710 --> 02:03.150
Our team will meet people there at 9:00 a.m., again,

02:03.150 --> 02:04.890
for a period of six hours.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.370
We'll end our journey at 10:00 a.m.

02:07.370 --> 02:11.039
the following day, the 21st, at the port of St. Louis.

02:11.300 --> 02:14.350
It's time to turn the tide and the bloodshed,

02:14.540 --> 02:18.010
put the past behind us, and heal this great nation,

02:18.140 --> 02:20.260
all of us together.

02:21.010 --> 02:21.810
Thank you.

02:24.450 --> 02:26.870
Run that every 15 minutes for the next three days.

02:26.870 --> 02:27.600
Got it.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:52.840 --> 02:54.740
On each phone is an app.

02:54.870 --> 02:58.380
Just press the eagle, and it'll take you right in.

02:59.020 --> 03:00.470
You hit the icon, first thing you'll see

03:00.470 --> 03:03.000
is a photo of immune leader Kevin Macdowell --

03:03.000 --> 03:04.700
number three under the Ramseys,

03:04.700 --> 03:05.850
one of their founding members,

03:05.860 --> 03:08.400
came to America months ago, started the movement here.

03:08.410 --> 03:10.460
He's still at large, last seen in Florida.

03:10.470 --> 03:12.290
Are we expecting him to be in Vicksburg?

03:12.290 --> 03:14.190
Unlikely. ‭He maintains the ability

03:14.190 --> 03:15.790
to communicate over the deadman network,

03:15.790 --> 03:18.360
so he can still cause trouble. Dr. Scott?

03:18.640 --> 03:20.340
With the wide radio call,

03:20.730 --> 03:21.470
we've hopefully given

03:21.470 --> 03:23.880
a large enough number of people enough time

03:24.090 --> 03:25.590
to make it to the port.

03:26.360 --> 03:29.400
As we pull in to shore, you'll all be given booster shots

03:29.500 --> 03:30.860
to compliment the vaccinations

03:30.860 --> 03:32.550
already running through your bodies.

03:32.550 --> 03:36.190
Within an hour, these boosters will make you vessels

03:36.190 --> 03:37.930
for the contagious cure.

03:38.110 --> 03:38.990
For how long?

03:39.410 --> 03:41.810
You'll be contagious for five to eight days,

03:41.930 --> 03:43.850
during which time, it is imperative

03:43.850 --> 03:47.150
that you pass it on to as many people as possible,

03:47.170 --> 03:49.280
who will then have five to eight days

03:49.280 --> 03:51.470
to do the same, and so on.

03:51.880 --> 03:55.630
We need a minimum of 10,000 people at each stop

03:55.630 --> 03:57.210
to sufficiently spread the cure

03:57.210 --> 03:59.080
across these sections of the country.

03:59.210 --> 04:01.170
What about dropping the cure from the sky?

04:01.590 --> 04:03.190
Didn't you find a way to make the aerosol work?

04:03.190 --> 04:04.060
I did.

04:04.580 --> 04:06.800
Unfortunately, I only have a limited supply,

04:07.600 --> 04:09.170
perhaps not even enough

04:09.170 --> 04:12.070
for the crowd the size that I am hoping for.

04:12.070 --> 04:16.339
So...the contagious cure really is our best hope.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.839
Okay, so, we make port, and then we go around

04:18.839 --> 04:20.450
breathing on anyone we can find?

04:20.450 --> 04:23.480
The cure is in the sweat on your bodies

04:24.150 --> 04:26.650
and the moisture in your breath.

04:26.940 --> 04:31.440
In order to maximize the chance of successful transmission...

04:33.520 --> 04:35.080
Would you be so kind?

04:36.590 --> 04:40.510
You shake the target's hand, you bring them in gently.

04:41.750 --> 04:45.670
Within six inches, you breathe normally,

04:46.020 --> 04:48.680
but forcefully for about five seconds

04:49.130 --> 04:53.140
as you're holding their hand and maintaining eye contact.

04:54.610 --> 04:56.290
I'm sorry for the onions.

04:59.110 --> 05:02.770
You try to make it as natural and as friendly as possible.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.160
Thank you so much.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.590
Equally effective would be taking a drink

05:06.590 --> 05:07.750
and share it with them.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.750
If they drink any small amount and your saliva mixes,

05:10.910 --> 05:12.210
then you are good to go.

05:12.210 --> 05:15.570
I guess kissing would work, too. You didn't mention that.

05:15.570 --> 05:18.390
Oh, for sure. Kissing could be a way to go

05:18.390 --> 05:20.580
if you're up for it and can get written consent.

05:20.980 --> 05:23.280
Now, one important thing to mention...

05:23.400 --> 05:25.050
you can only get the booster shot once,

05:25.050 --> 05:27.820
so if the chain of immunization is broken

05:27.820 --> 05:30.600
and we don't successfully spread the contagious cure...

05:33.120 --> 05:34.670
we don't get another chance.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.980
We're going up river with no tomahawks,

05:40.980 --> 05:44.120
no sm-2s, no shells for the 5-inch,

05:44.360 --> 05:46.740
and barely enough ammo for our sentries.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.220
Thanks to Val's network,

05:48.220 --> 05:49.270
the President's spoken

05:49.270 --> 05:51.370
to most of the immune leaders around the country.

05:51.620 --> 05:55.230
They've agreed to stand down in exchange for pardons.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.270
And we're trusting their word?

05:57.270 --> 06:00.310
We have to repair the ship, and we have to refuel.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.950
Now, the airfield in St. Louis

06:01.950 --> 06:03.710
give us the best shot at that.

06:03.730 --> 06:07.400
And heading upriver means we spread the cure,

06:07.430 --> 06:09.820
win hearts and minds, which is our mission.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.270
I get that, Master Chief.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.900
But we're putting out a call on an open channel,

06:14.240 --> 06:16.360
letting the whole country know where to find us.

06:18.130 --> 06:19.670
If people come looking for a fight,

06:19.940 --> 06:22.540
we'll be outmanned and outgunned.

06:24.910 --> 06:27.920
So, I heard ‭you've been pardoning everybody.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.090
That's real presidential of you.

06:31.090 --> 06:34.070
Your offer expires ‭in 20 minutes. Surrender now.

06:34.210 --> 06:36.660
Oh, my dear Jeffrey,

06:37.460 --> 06:39.490
how quickly ‭you've changed your colors.

06:39.490 --> 06:40.690
Let's make it 10 minutes.

06:40.690 --> 06:41.900
I believe I have the coordinates, sir.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.320
He's still in northern Florida.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.510
We know exactly where you are, Kevin.

06:47.220 --> 06:50.070
A tomahawk missile ‭can be sitting in your lap in 90 seconds,

06:50.070 --> 06:50.910
if that's what you want.

06:50.920 --> 06:54.210
So, which is it then -- mercy or threats?

06:55.480 --> 06:57.480
You better get your story straight.

06:58.060 --> 07:00.010
You can't win this, Macdowell. It's over.

07:00.510 --> 07:02.530
And you haven't hung up, so what do you want?

07:02.760 --> 07:04.620
You were my protégé.

07:05.770 --> 07:07.690
‭Do you remember how I found you,

07:08.510 --> 07:10.660
all curled up in a ball,

07:11.400 --> 07:15.910
moaning about your wife, your children?

07:16.640 --> 07:19.260
Such a sad sack you were.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.840
And where is it that you're going?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.840
We're a global organization.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.030
You know how big our reach is.

07:26.990 --> 07:30.940
I'll get out of your hair for now, but rest assured,

07:31.330 --> 07:34.390
you and me, ‭we've got unfinished business.

07:40.140 --> 07:41.950
You sure you don't have one missile left?

07:42.620 --> 07:44.430
Can you track their phones?

07:44.860 --> 07:46.690
Please don't insult me.

07:47.630 --> 07:49.580
‭The transmission came over VHF.

07:49.580 --> 07:51.240
They asked for you specifically.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.340
Do you know where they are?

07:52.340 --> 07:54.080
I didn't have a chance to ask.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.510
Who are they?

07:56.560 --> 07:57.970
They're my wife's parents.

08:04.790 --> 08:06.860
Remember... it's an open line.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.490
This is Russell Jeter hailing Sonia and Henry Morris

08:13.490 --> 08:15.200
on channel 1-6. Over.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.070
Russell? It's Sonia and Henry.

08:19.260 --> 08:20.380
How are you, son?

08:20.380 --> 08:21.750
Hanging in there, sir.

08:21.860 --> 08:24.340
Question is, how are you? Where are you?

08:24.680 --> 08:26.050
We're down in Laurel.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.500
Found an abandoned old cabin with a well and a generator.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.190
It's just a couple hundred miles from Vicksburg.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.750
We heard the message over the broadcast

08:34.750 --> 08:37.730
that your ship has the cure. Is it true?

08:38.200 --> 08:40.440
It is true. It is absolutely true.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.940
We have a truck, and there's a gas station

08:42.940 --> 08:45.780
a couple of miles from here that might have some fuel.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.730
Should we try to get to you?

08:47.930 --> 08:50.080
We think we can make it if we leave now.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.700
Where you are -- it's safe there?

08:53.120 --> 08:55.140
Haven't seen another soul for months.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.390
We've been rationing our food,

08:57.510 --> 08:59.130
making runs when we need to.

08:59.570 --> 09:00.950
And there's decent hunting.

09:00.950 --> 09:02.430
Can you hang in a few more weeks?

09:02.440 --> 09:04.090
I can come and find you then.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.620
Why, Russell?

09:05.760 --> 09:08.160
Is there something wrong with Vicksburg?

09:09.930 --> 09:11.650
I will try and reach you back on this frequency

09:11.650 --> 09:13.750
once I know ‭what the situation is there.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.210
Until then, I need you to stand by

09:15.210 --> 09:17.330
and wait to hear from me, okay?

09:18.010 --> 09:21.040
Well, if you think it's safer for us to stay put...

09:21.040 --> 09:24.000
That is what I think... for now.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.130
Make sure they stay turned on.

09:28.170 --> 09:29.760
Why can't we just toss them?

09:29.940 --> 09:32.320
Because the Navy's gonna be tracking them, dimwit.

09:34.230 --> 09:35.310
Our cargo loaded up?

09:35.310 --> 09:36.960
Yeah, everybody's packed in tight.

09:36.960 --> 09:37.980
We're ready to roll.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.700
- You get the uniforms? - It's just nine.

09:42.710 --> 09:44.550
It's all we could get from the surplus.

09:44.550 --> 09:45.640
Nine it is, then.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.490
You go with Darren and his team and get rid of the phones.

09:49.760 --> 09:50.760
Okay, got it.

09:51.630 --> 09:53.380
The rest of you men with me. Let's go!

09:53.380 --> 09:54.840
We've got a schedule to keep.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.170
All right, boys, let's move it.

09:56.340 --> 09:57.760
Let's go. We're rolling.

10:07.230 --> 10:08.360
The Mississippi.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.640
Snipers every six feet.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.290
Bet you Mark Twain didn't go up the river with sentries.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.520
Not even close.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.960
Commodore still keeping a guard on you.

10:18.780 --> 10:21.920
He is nothing ‭if not a man of his word.

10:21.930 --> 10:23.390
You can say that again.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.590
I wanted to let you know that once we land,

10:27.590 --> 10:28.940
I'm going my own way...

10:30.290 --> 10:31.340
to Jackson.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.440
For your daughter.

10:34.230 --> 10:38.680
Thing is, is you said the booster lasts only five, six days.

10:39.090 --> 10:40.870
I was thinking I could bum a couple of

10:41.220 --> 10:43.250
the old-fashioned shots of the vaccine,

10:44.230 --> 10:45.700
in case I don't find them by then.

10:49.410 --> 10:51.190
I think that could be arranged.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.710
Is this Macdowell?

10:59.710 --> 11:00.990
He's over the Atlantic.

11:00.990 --> 11:03.130
Looks like he's headed for Ireland.

11:03.220 --> 11:04.560
Scotland, maybe?

11:04.560 --> 11:06.110
What's your range on those phones?

11:06.110 --> 11:08.280
I'll probably lose him somewhere over Newfoundland,

11:08.290 --> 11:10.880
But I'm trying to link into a Swedish satellite,

11:10.940 --> 11:12.410
see if I can create a handoff.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.140
There's no authority there even to warn.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.780
Europe's next on the docket.

11:15.850 --> 11:18.700
- How soon till Vicksburg? - 48 minutes.

11:25.570 --> 11:26.550
Seen it yet?

11:26.830 --> 11:29.270
Should be coming up just now, sir, to the east.

11:35.990 --> 11:37.210
Where is everybody?

11:39.760 --> 11:40.930
What the hell happened?

11:47.600 --> 11:48.630
It's not enough.

11:50.820 --> 11:52.150
It's not nearly enough.

11:54.610 --> 11:57.250
127 people, no one else for miles.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.010
Well, we're still broadcasting on all channels.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.950
Hopefully we'll get a few more stragglers.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.260
Can we stretch it any longer?

12:02.260 --> 12:04.310
Not if we still want to stop in Memphis

12:04.310 --> 12:05.830
and make it to St. Louis.

12:06.260 --> 12:08.040
Garnett says ‭we barely have enough fuel

12:08.040 --> 12:09.490
to idle here for the six hours.

12:09.490 --> 12:11.260
Maybe we send the land teams inland,

12:11.420 --> 12:12.520
spread the cure,

12:12.550 --> 12:14.510
get us some answers why people stayed away.

12:14.620 --> 12:17.400
They can catch us upriver, depending how it goes.

12:17.420 --> 12:19.780
Let's make sure we put our tightest detail on the President.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.380
He's gonna want to shake hands himself,

12:21.380 --> 12:23.940
encourage people to fan out and spread the cure.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.440
It's a P.R. game as much as anything now.

12:26.440 --> 12:27.310
Aye, sir.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.910
If things are going south, I can stick around.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.290
Find your girl, Tex.

12:40.350 --> 12:42.480
Meet me in St. Louie, Louie.

12:53.050 --> 12:55.560
The President shook my hand himself, gave me the cure.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.700
Anybody wants or needs it,

12:56.700 --> 12:58.680
I'm in Greenville, Mississippi, at the old church.

12:58.680 --> 12:59.970
They're spreading it.

13:00.340 --> 13:01.670
You heard the other ones.

13:02.270 --> 13:03.940
Vicksburg was a bust.

13:04.490 --> 13:06.620
Michener threw a party, and nobody showed up.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.480
They got word of mouth now.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.330
What's that gonna mean for Memphis?

13:10.330 --> 13:13.230
Well, the more the better, as far as I'm concerned.

13:13.510 --> 13:15.370
We'll handle all takers.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.720
Hey, we're hungry! We need water!

13:21.160 --> 13:23.050
Suppose we should feed them.

13:24.110 --> 13:26.860
We got to keep them alive a little while longer, right?

13:33.640 --> 13:34.980
We need water!

13:39.120 --> 13:42.370
This is USS Nathan James on Channel 1-6

13:42.370 --> 13:44.750
calling Sonia and Henry Morris.

13:44.750 --> 13:47.440
If you are out there, please respond.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.500
- Listen to this. - I'm not lying.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.410
It was someone from that navy ship.

13:51.410 --> 13:53.280
They said Vicksburg wasn't safe,

13:53.280 --> 13:55.120
told his own family not to come.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.110
That's what we heard, too...

13:56.110 --> 13:57.310
- Patch me through. - ‭Yes, sir.

13:57.310 --> 13:58.090
...but I just got some chatter from people.

13:58.100 --> 14:01.560
Supposedly, they had the cure, and the President even came out.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.520
This is Master Chief Russell Jeter of USS Nathan James.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.060
I was the one who told my family not to come to Vicksburg.

14:07.060 --> 14:09.160
I was wrong. It was safe there.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.600
There was no fighting.

14:11.590 --> 14:14.660
If you can hear this, please spread the word.

14:14.660 --> 14:16.220
We have the cure.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.820
We will be in Memphis tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.

14:18.820 --> 14:19.950
Meet us there.

14:20.010 --> 14:22.330
Become part of ‭the healing of this country.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.180
Stop right there, easy rider.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.250
Turn around and go back where you came from.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.040
I'm not gonna tell you twice.

14:56.280 --> 14:59.100
I'm looking for my daughter, Kathleen.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.100
Her mother, Claire Nolan.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.430
You know where they are?

15:05.080 --> 15:06.400
So, you're Ken.

15:06.760 --> 15:07.570
Yeah.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.980
My friends call me Tex.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.180
I'm Court.

15:13.820 --> 15:16.110
Claire and Kat ‭were staying here with me.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.370
"Were."

15:19.470 --> 15:20.450
Where are they?

15:20.730 --> 15:23.550
Kat heard about that ship with the cure.

15:23.670 --> 15:25.470
I talked her out of it for a day and a night,

15:25.470 --> 15:28.730
but she said she had to find out for herself.

15:28.730 --> 15:31.170
It's too late to catch that stop in Vicksburg,

15:31.360 --> 15:34.720
so she took off, heading towards Memphis.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.270
And Claire?

15:44.980 --> 15:47.800
Looters came in the night about three months ago.

15:48.340 --> 15:50.820
I thought a raccoon had got in the kitchen.

15:52.210 --> 15:53.110
Claire...

15:54.820 --> 15:56.490
was the first down the steps.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.640
It was quick, ‭but she managed to warn us.

16:02.050 --> 16:04.680
I had my hands full with the guys in front.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.540
Kat ran to my room,

16:08.500 --> 16:11.020
hauled this old shotgun out of my closet,

16:11.960 --> 16:14.180
held it at her waist like I taught her,

16:14.690 --> 16:16.840
and fired point-blank through the door,

16:17.160 --> 16:19.750
got the rest of those fellas as they were coming in.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.250
That girl of yours,

16:23.730 --> 16:25.370
she's got a hell of a heart.

16:27.320 --> 16:31.860
Still... ‭Hail Mary call to that ship.

16:32.340 --> 16:33.830
I told her not to go.

16:35.040 --> 16:39.590
I mean, how do you know if it's real or not?

16:42.240 --> 16:43.300
It's for real.

16:48.930 --> 16:50.530
We got to start spreading it.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.910
Val and your comms team estimated that

17:08.910 --> 17:11.359
there may be as many as 10,000 people

17:11.960 --> 17:13.480
in and around St. Louis,

17:13.480 --> 17:16.030
that there's some kind of power and infrastructure

17:16.040 --> 17:17.099
still in place.

17:18.420 --> 17:19.520
I don't want to get my hopes up,

17:19.520 --> 17:22.099
but look at all these arteries feeding into the city,

17:22.500 --> 17:24.530
rivers, highways, railroads.

17:24.849 --> 17:27.900
D.C. was the center of the country back in the 1790s.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.090
It was a good place for the capital then, but now,

17:30.090 --> 17:31.750
now the midwest is the center.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.960
The gateway to the west.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.840
As much as I'd fancy living in the white house,

17:37.300 --> 17:39.150
this is a more expedient plan.

17:39.920 --> 17:40.760
Come in.

17:42.770 --> 17:43.950
I'm sorry to disturb you both,

17:43.950 --> 17:45.890
but there's something I feel I need to tell you.

17:50.950 --> 17:53.450
Not long after the President's radio message,

17:53.620 --> 17:54.980
comms picked up a call for me

17:54.980 --> 17:56.710
from my mother, and father-in-law.

17:57.190 --> 17:59.260
When they asked if they should come meet us in Vicksburg,

17:59.270 --> 18:00.770
I told them no.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.330
Now I can't get ahold of them.

18:05.410 --> 18:07.020
And it's clear there's been a...

18:07.230 --> 18:08.460
there's been a negative domino effect

18:08.460 --> 18:10.860
from anyone who might have overheard me.

18:10.970 --> 18:12.450
It was an open line?

18:12.600 --> 18:17.100
I got back on that channel myself and tried to undo it.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.110
But I thought you should know.

18:21.470 --> 18:24.650
It looks like I may have contributed to the low turnout,

18:24.650 --> 18:28.340
and if so... I deeply regret it.

18:31.390 --> 18:34.400
I appreciate you letting us know, Master Chief.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.320
He lost the rest of his family years ago.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.030
Those people are all he has left.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.940
Everyone's suffered losses.

18:53.260 --> 18:55.040
This could jeopardize Memphis and undermine

18:55.040 --> 18:56.970
everything we've been trying to do.

18:57.430 --> 18:59.820
For people to get a message like that from our ship?

18:59.830 --> 19:02.430
It's gonna take a while for people to trust again,

19:02.430 --> 19:05.140
whether or not they heard what the Master Chief said.

19:05.140 --> 19:08.770
He knew it was an open line, and he made a choice.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.020
You're right.

19:15.390 --> 19:16.760
I'm sorry, sir.

19:17.550 --> 19:18.970
Won't happen again.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.470
Stay away from me.

19:51.990 --> 19:52.900
Stay back.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.310
Stay away from me.

19:57.190 --> 19:57.960
I'm sick.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.140
Who did this? They still around?

20:06.130 --> 20:07.400
Tell me what happened.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.070
Immunes.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.840
They saw that I had the virus.

20:11.550 --> 20:13.650
The grabbed me back in Tallahassee,

20:13.940 --> 20:15.010
brought me here.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.440
All the way from Florida, huh?

20:20.240 --> 20:21.240
How many?

20:21.600 --> 20:25.920
They got a truck full of sick people, maybe 8, 10 guys.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.210
They stopped here for gas,

20:29.400 --> 20:31.990
forced me to walk around --

20:32.980 --> 20:36.210
try to expose the virus to everybody.

20:36.630 --> 20:37.640
They fought back.

20:38.760 --> 20:41.450
The immunes took care of them the old-fashioned way.

20:41.710 --> 20:43.340
I got caught in the cross fire.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.700
Where were they taking you?

20:46.490 --> 20:47.460
Memphis.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.830
Copy that. Vulture Team's 30 miles outside of Memphis.

20:53.830 --> 20:55.460
Tex is gonna try to hook up with them there.

20:55.580 --> 20:56.600
They ditched all their phones.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.270
I-I can't track them at all.

20:58.270 --> 20:59.340
That's smart...

21:00.960 --> 21:02.730
flying them over the Atlantic.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.380
You want me to send out a message

21:05.420 --> 21:07.180
telling people to stay away from Memphis?

21:07.180 --> 21:09.670
We do that, we lose all our credibility...for good.

21:09.670 --> 21:11.050
I get that, but we don't want

21:11.050 --> 21:12.130
another New Orleans on our hands.

21:12.130 --> 21:14.430
They're not looking ‭for a shoot-'em-up this time.

21:14.570 --> 21:16.570
They're trucking in the sick to infect the crowd,

21:16.570 --> 21:19.060
create a panic so that no one ever answers our call again.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.090
- How far out are we? - Four hours.

21:21.090 --> 21:23.680
How many miles, as the crow flies?

21:24.140 --> 21:25.180
37.

21:25.630 --> 21:27.810
- Send the helo? - With the aerosol.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.770
This is enough for how many?

21:31.840 --> 21:34.740
It should blanket ‭an area of half a square mile,

21:34.740 --> 21:36.880
depending on the winds and how concentrated an area

21:36.890 --> 21:38.050
the people are packed into.

21:38.850 --> 21:40.980
Given our limited supply, we'll have one chance.

21:41.260 --> 21:42.790
How many people ‭are we expecting this time?

21:42.790 --> 21:44.600
Just give me everything you've got.

21:44.610 --> 21:45.910
This is the last of it.

22:01.550 --> 22:04.330
There's got to be thousands shown up by now, boss.

22:04.340 --> 22:07.080
Jeffrey thinks they had a shabby crowd at Vicksburg.

22:08.210 --> 22:09.790
After this, ‭the only Americans who show up

22:09.790 --> 22:11.920
to greet that ship ‭will be looking to sink it.

22:12.490 --> 22:14.500
You let the good people of Memphis see

22:14.500 --> 22:17.470
that the U.S. Navy ‭didn't bring a cure after all.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.910
And then you chase them out,

22:19.960 --> 22:21.940
and you let them run as fast as they can,

22:22.520 --> 22:26.340
spreading the virus and the bad news.

22:34.900 --> 22:36.660
Kathleen Nolan!

22:37.540 --> 22:38.620
Kathleen!

22:39.460 --> 22:40.520
Kathleen!

22:40.710 --> 22:41.680
- Hey, can I use that? ‭- Yep.

22:41.680 --> 22:42.690
- Thank you. - ‭Mm-hmm.

22:42.740 --> 22:43.800
Kathleen!

22:45.280 --> 22:46.310
Kathleen?

22:50.720 --> 22:52.780
Kathleen G. Nolan!

22:56.100 --> 22:57.970
It's your old man! Kathleen!

22:58.930 --> 23:01.530
Kathleen, are you out there? Kathleen Nolan?

23:01.730 --> 23:02.750
Dad!

23:04.320 --> 23:05.340
Dad!

23:11.140 --> 23:12.820
- Kathleen. ‭- Daddy.

23:14.900 --> 23:15.890
Baby.

23:17.990 --> 23:19.980
Dad, mom...

23:23.480 --> 23:24.500
I know.

23:29.230 --> 23:30.920
I can't believe you're alive.

23:31.770 --> 23:32.950
I missed you so much.

23:36.530 --> 23:37.880
Can you forgive me?

23:39.730 --> 23:41.750
Can you forgive me for not being there?

23:43.350 --> 23:44.330
Yeah?

24:10.530 --> 24:11.670
Those are not our guys.

24:20.170 --> 24:21.210
Wait a second.

24:27.330 --> 24:28.440
Aw, hell.

24:28.880 --> 24:29.910
You keep your head down.

24:31.290 --> 24:32.470
All teams, this is Tex.

24:32.470 --> 24:33.530
I found Macdowell.

24:33.530 --> 24:34.970
He's here at the college.

24:35.150 --> 24:36.980
Shaved his beard, 6'5",

24:36.980 --> 24:38.520
And the bastard is dressed like navy.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.100
I repeat -- eyes on Macdowell,

24:41.210 --> 24:43.310
Northeast corner of the campus.

24:43.310 --> 24:44.900
He has other fellas with him.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.160
I'm guessing that they're immunes,

24:46.160 --> 24:48.100
and they're all in digi blues.

24:48.110 --> 24:49.320
That guy was right.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.510
They're here to infect people with the virus.

24:51.910 --> 24:54.100
This is Cobra team, headed northeast to intercept.

24:54.260 --> 24:57.240
I got eyes on more immunes, also sporting navy blue.

24:57.940 --> 24:58.920
Stay tuned.

25:05.970 --> 25:06.570
Navy's here.

25:06.570 --> 25:09.230
That's right. At your service.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.950
We're here to get you all sick,

25:13.620 --> 25:16.180
courtesy of your United States navy.

25:16.870 --> 25:18.950
He's got the virus! Get back!

25:18.950 --> 25:20.450
Run, everybody! It's a trap!

25:22.420 --> 25:23.880
Run! It's a trap!

25:24.840 --> 25:26.290
Get down. Keep your head down.

25:48.170 --> 25:50.360
Come with me. Come with me.

25:50.360 --> 25:51.940
How far out is that helo?

25:52.100 --> 25:53.220
Five minutes away.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.360
Boss! Boss!

25:58.540 --> 26:00.560
I can't get the guys at the gate on the radio.

26:00.690 --> 26:03.350
I'm telling you -- ‭the Navy got here early, boss.

26:21.450 --> 26:22.870
Nathan James, we have the package.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.690
- I'm gonna open the gate. - No! Wait!

26:28.040 --> 26:29.410
If these people have been exposed,

26:29.480 --> 26:30.250
we can't let them leave.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.530
We have to keep them contained until the helo arrives.

26:32.970 --> 26:34.910
- Danny, we can't just -- - We're not coming back.

26:34.910 --> 26:36.470
If these people leave here infected,

26:36.690 --> 26:38.350
we can't cure them with the aerosol.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.010
Stay back! ‭Back up!

26:46.360 --> 26:48.010
Nathan James, we have a panicked crowd of civilians,

26:48.010 --> 26:49.860
sick and healthy, ‭who are trying to get away.

26:49.950 --> 26:51.410
They think the Navy tricked them.

26:51.450 --> 26:52.960
I don't know how long we can hold them back.

26:53.290 --> 26:54.660
No, no, not again.

26:54.660 --> 26:57.790
Copy, Vulture Team. Saberhawk One is three mikes out.

26:57.910 --> 27:00.080
Saberhawk One en route with the payload.

27:00.890 --> 27:01.560
Everybody, just stay where you are!

27:01.560 --> 27:03.600
No! Don't leave! ‭Please, the cure is coming.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.550
- Stay where you are! - The cure is coming!

27:04.550 --> 27:06.170
- Don't leave. The cure is coming. - Stay where you are!

27:06.170 --> 27:07.840
The cure is coming. Please stay.

27:08.180 --> 27:09.990
- Stay where you are! - Don't leave. Don't leave.

27:09.990 --> 27:11.840
- The cure is coming. - The cure is coming!

27:11.840 --> 27:15.270
The cure is coming. The cure is coming. Trust us.

27:15.590 --> 27:18.150
- Look! - ‭Yes! That's the cure!

27:18.280 --> 27:20.430
all you have to do is breathe it in.

27:20.580 --> 27:22.420
That's our helicopter right there. Just stay calm.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.110
That's the cure. ‭We're gonna put our weapons away.

27:24.330 --> 27:25.500
It's okay. We're gonna take it, too.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.000
Look. We put down our guns.

27:30.020 --> 27:31.030
Take it in.

27:31.630 --> 27:33.340
Just relax. Just relax.

27:33.340 --> 27:34.280
It's okay.

27:34.860 --> 27:36.270
- Yeah? - ‭Breathe it in.

27:37.270 --> 27:38.220
Yeah.

27:42.980 --> 27:45.270
Masks off! Breathe it in!

27:45.890 --> 27:47.680
All you have to do is breathe it in!

27:56.940 --> 27:58.250
Yeah, that's right. Breathe it in.

27:59.190 --> 28:00.800
Now we're all immune, asshole.

28:07.810 --> 28:12.070
Well, if it isn't Mr. President, gone all navy blue.

28:14.090 --> 28:16.860
You're not still blubbering over your poor children, are you?

28:16.870 --> 28:18.550
I'm gonna spell it out for you, Kevin.

28:19.390 --> 28:21.740
The more people we save, the more your men will realize

28:21.740 --> 28:23.930
immunes aren't so special anymore.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.840
Your movement will dissolve as quickly as it rose,

28:27.480 --> 28:29.960
and your followers ‭will fade into the background.

28:32.340 --> 28:35.040
Point is, we can make you a martyr,

28:35.040 --> 28:36.800
but who would care?

28:38.210 --> 28:39.220
Work with us.

28:39.860 --> 28:41.030
Get your men to stand down,

28:42.530 --> 28:46.100
and you may live to see your freedom again...one day.

28:47.070 --> 28:48.440
I'm not sure I can sell that.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.950
I have confidence in you, Kevin.

28:51.620 --> 28:53.760
Lord knows you can be very persuasive.

29:02.170 --> 29:04.120
You still offering me one of your pardons?

29:11.790 --> 29:14.630
O.O.D., navigation holds us on track in the channel.

29:14.990 --> 29:16.760
Recommend maintaining course and speed.

29:16.760 --> 29:17.800
How's our depth?

29:18.120 --> 29:19.320
60 feet, sir.

29:19.320 --> 29:22.210
Closest shoal water 250 yards off the starboard bow.

29:22.730 --> 29:24.570
2% fuel remaining, sir.

29:24.650 --> 29:25.600
We're coasting in.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.840
Sir, recommend slowing to bare steerage.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.270
O.O.D., bring her in.

29:31.370 --> 29:32.270
Aye, sir.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.640
St. Louis or bust.

29:42.770 --> 29:46.220
However this plays out, thank you both

29:47.480 --> 29:49.340
for everything you've done to get us here.

30:34.340 --> 30:35.170
Yes!

30:38.660 --> 30:40.570
You were right, Mr. President.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.710
This is the place.

32:48.840 --> 32:51.780
Doc! Hey, doc!

32:57.760 --> 32:59.340
You must be Kathleen.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.040
That'd be me.

33:01.340 --> 33:03.920
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to meet you.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.130
My God, you're pretty.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.030
She takes after her mother.

33:15.850 --> 33:17.040
Master Chief...

33:18.640 --> 33:19.970
...they've been looking for you.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.540
We got to Memphis late,

33:27.780 --> 33:31.890
so we just decided to just keep driving.

33:34.170 --> 33:35.710
I thought ‭something happened to you.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.420
All those years...

33:39.010 --> 33:41.130
and we never reached out to you.

33:41.970 --> 33:44.370
I understand. You couldn't.

33:44.370 --> 33:47.670
We could, we just didn't.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.420
And we left you all alone.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.250
You found me now.

34:09.389 --> 34:12.820
I, Jeffrey Allen Michener, do solemnly swear...

34:13.020 --> 34:14.469
"...that I will faithfully execute

34:14.469 --> 34:16.969
the office of president of the United States..."

34:16.989 --> 34:18.330
...that I will faithfully execute

34:18.330 --> 34:20.429
the office of president of the United States...

34:20.429 --> 34:22.650
"...and will, ‭to the best of my ability,

34:22.650 --> 34:24.790
preserve, protect, and defend..."

34:24.790 --> 34:26.719
...and will, ‭to the best of my ability,

34:26.719 --> 34:28.310
preserve, protect, and defend...

34:28.310 --> 34:30.790
"...the Constitution of the United States..."

34:30.790 --> 34:32.750
...the Constitution of the United States.

34:32.750 --> 34:35.880
- "...So help me God." ... - So help me God.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.239
Here you are, ma'am.

34:58.910 --> 35:00.650
Quite the ball, Mr. President.

35:00.930 --> 35:02.040
I thought it might be a bit unseemly,

35:02.050 --> 35:03.670
given the circumstances.

35:03.670 --> 35:05.400
Eisenhower had them.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.120
So did Lincoln during the civil war.

35:08.460 --> 35:12.330
People need to celebrate, even in the worst of times.

35:13.890 --> 35:17.510
Seeing as the James is in dry dock for months, well,

35:17.770 --> 35:21.590
I'm gonna need you here... As Chief of Naval Operations.

35:23.390 --> 35:25.290
That's a pretty big jump, sir.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.520
Don't forget -- I was number 12.

35:30.140 --> 35:32.570
Fly your family out. They'll settle here.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.090
There'll be plenty to do.

35:34.420 --> 35:35.600
I'm already hearing from the northeast

35:35.600 --> 35:37.480
about more lawlessness,

35:37.720 --> 35:40.310
factions of warlords fighting over big cities,

35:40.710 --> 35:43.470
battles over natural resources in the southwest.

35:43.890 --> 35:47.310
South America -- they're even in worse shape than us.

35:47.810 --> 35:50.270
We have a nation to build and a world to repair.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.700
And there's no one I trust more.

35:52.950 --> 35:54.290
Sounds like an order.

35:54.900 --> 35:55.720
It is.

35:56.380 --> 35:59.830
Tonight we rest and enjoy our success.

36:00.590 --> 36:03.000
Tomorrow, the fight for America

36:03.000 --> 36:04.880
and the rest of the world begins.

36:10.250 --> 36:11.820
All right, it was Christmas eve.

36:12.060 --> 36:13.780
We're doing this anti-piracy mission

36:13.780 --> 36:15.510
off the coast of Somalia.

36:15.820 --> 36:18.870
We come across ‭this poor Hungarian freighter --

36:19.090 --> 36:22.650
Engine problems, 50-person crew, nowhere to go.

36:22.670 --> 36:25.570
Frankie and I were -- were running point.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.270
Meanwhile, back on our ship,

36:27.270 --> 36:30.720
our mail arrives from home -- presents from our families.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.580
Frankie turns to me, and he says,

36:34.190 --> 36:35.910
"What about the Hungarians?

36:36.170 --> 36:37.650
Don't they get a Christmas?"

36:38.800 --> 36:42.030
And I'm like, "Frankie, like, this is a hostile situation."

36:42.070 --> 36:45.160
But he's not hearing it, not for a second.

36:46.570 --> 36:47.360
30 minutes later,

36:47.360 --> 36:50.150
Our helo is hovering over that Hungarian ship.

36:50.160 --> 36:53.550
Frankie is fast-roping down, dressed as Santa Claus...

36:54.360 --> 36:57.970
...handing out presents to that entire crew.

36:58.990 --> 37:00.110
That is awesome.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.470
That was Frankie Benz.

37:08.350 --> 37:09.660
To Frankie Benz.

37:10.100 --> 37:11.890
- Frankie. - Frankie benz.

37:12.170 --> 37:13.940
- Frankie Benz. - ‭Benz.

37:15.130 --> 37:15.800
Benzo.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.180
- Benzo! - ‭Benzo.

37:17.180 --> 37:18.080
Benzo.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.230
To Chung.

37:29.510 --> 37:30.400
To Lynn.

37:32.410 --> 37:33.260
To Maya.

37:35.350 --> 37:36.210
Smith.

37:37.040 --> 37:37.960
To Berchem.

37:39.660 --> 37:40.620
To Barker.

37:41.310 --> 37:42.330
To Cossetti.

37:42.940 --> 37:43.830
To Cody.

37:44.650 --> 37:45.670
To Bivas.

37:47.410 --> 37:48.320
To Bivas.

37:50.990 --> 37:51.800
Hear, hear.

37:51.840 --> 37:52.740
Hear, hear.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.100
Beat me to it.

38:08.970 --> 38:10.920
I was gonna leave this under your door.

38:12.460 --> 38:14.190
Flying out ‭first thing in the morning.

38:14.530 --> 38:15.400
I wanted to make sure you got

38:15.400 --> 38:18.240
the epidemiological models for the President.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.160
Where you going?

38:19.200 --> 38:21.260
First Lincoln, Nebraska --

38:21.510 --> 38:23.200
a fresh outbreak's been reported there,

38:23.200 --> 38:25.310
most likely immune dead-enders --

38:25.900 --> 38:29.790
then Toledo, Sioux Falls, then on west.

38:29.910 --> 38:31.590
So, the President ordered this?

38:31.600 --> 38:32.570
He did.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.210
He also included me in his pardon.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.580
Hence, no more guards.

38:38.680 --> 38:39.280
We're not on the ship,

38:39.280 --> 38:41.870
So it's not really up to you anymore.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.620
No. It isn't.

38:44.620 --> 38:46.670
Well, I have to say, I'm slightly disappointed.

38:46.670 --> 38:49.660
I was... kind of looking forward

38:49.660 --> 38:52.080
to seeing you squirm on the witness stand.

38:54.020 --> 38:56.110
I would have stood by my decision.

38:56.110 --> 38:57.590
I would have counted on that.

38:58.770 --> 39:02.750
But I would have given you a sterling character reference.

39:02.970 --> 39:05.450
Of course, ‭you wouldn't have needed mine.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.360
You would have gotten 204 of those.

39:11.670 --> 39:13.000
Great dress, by the way.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.010
The judge's daughter loaned it to me.

39:19.010 --> 39:23.460
She insisted that I couldn't really go to an inaugural ball

39:23.460 --> 39:25.180
dressed in jeans.

39:26.670 --> 39:28.100
You could have pulled it off.

39:52.670 --> 39:54.310
I'll see you when I see you.

40:04.070 --> 40:05.240
Be safe.

40:09.050 --> 40:10.300
When you get back...

40:11.950 --> 40:12.830
find me.

40:23.290 --> 40:24.670
Sing us a little chantey, Tex.

40:24.680 --> 40:25.900
Little bit drunk.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.470
I need a little help with this one.

40:29.020 --> 40:33.090
{\an9}*We'll be all right between the devil and the deep*

40:33.090 --> 40:37.000
{\an9}*We'll be all right between the devil and the deep*

40:37.000 --> 40:40.720
{\an9}*We'll be all right between the devil and the deep*

40:40.720 --> 40:44.530
{\an9}*And we'll all hang on behind*

40:44.660 --> 40:48.490
{\an9}*So, we'll roll the old chariot along*

40:48.490 --> 40:52.250
{\an9}*We'll roll the old chariot along*

40:52.260 --> 40:56.070
{\an9}*We'll roll the old chariot along*

40:56.070 --> 40:59.920
{\an9}*And we'll all hang on behind*

40:59.980 --> 41:03.640
{\an9}*We'll be all right 'cause we sail the Nathan James*

41:03.640 --> 41:07.920
{\an9}*We'll be all right 'cause we sail the Nathan James*

41:08.140 --> 41:09.880
Is now a good time?

41:10.470 --> 41:13.040
I've been trying to find the right moment to do this.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.590
I got this ring ‭from your mom in Norfolk

41:15.880 --> 41:18.650
and her blessing, and I-I just think it's probably --

41:18.860 --> 41:22.650
{\an9}*We'll roll the old chariot along*

41:22.650 --> 41:26.450
{\an9}*We'll roll the old chariot along*

41:26.450 --> 41:30.280
{\an9}*And we'll all hang on behind*

41:39.070 --> 41:39.890
Hi.

41:42.340 --> 41:43.880
Are you the lady who made the cure?

41:47.480 --> 41:48.290
Yes.

41:48.570 --> 41:49.780
Can I get it?

41:51.360 --> 41:53.030
Well, weren't you in the park earlier?

41:54.030 --> 41:56.680
No. I missed the party.

41:56.890 --> 41:58.380
Well, with so many people exposed,

41:58.380 --> 42:01.210
it's likely you caught it just walking into the hotel.

42:01.280 --> 42:04.100
Still, I'd like to get it from you...

42:05.050 --> 42:06.680
for history and all.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.970
How close do you have to be?

42:14.540 --> 42:15.710
That's close enough.

42:17.190 --> 42:17.960
Yeah.

42:19.660 --> 42:20.700
I think so.

42:24.990 --> 42:26.870
Sic semper tyrannis.
