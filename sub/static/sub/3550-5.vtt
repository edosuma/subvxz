WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.036
I BOOKED OUR ROOM
AT THE MOTEL...

00:05.036 --> 00:07.278
(whispers) AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE TONIGHT.
 (whispers) NEITHER DO I.

00:07.278 --> 00:11.242
AFFAIRS GOT SERIOUS...
 IF YOU GOT HIT BY A BUS,
I'D REALLY MISS YOU.

00:11.242 --> 00:13.013
YOU'RE SHOWERING ALONE
TONIGHT.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.216
I LOVE YOU.
THERE. I SAID IT.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.488
AN EX-LOVER...
 WHY--WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:17.488 --> 00:22.093
JUST LETTING YOU KNOW
I'M HERE FOR YOU.
 LET'S JUST SAY HE WAS GRATEFUL--
VERY GRATEFUL.

00:22.093 --> 00:23.454
SPUN OUT OF CONTROL.

00:23.454 --> 00:25.196
AAH!

00:25.196 --> 00:26.627
YOU'RE FIRED.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.799
AND WHEN A CRIME
WAS COMMITTED...
 (gasps and chokes)

00:28.799 --> 00:33.164
A NEIGHBOR WAS SUSPECTED.
 EVERYBODY THINKS I'M THE PERV
WHO ATTACKED JULIE.

00:33.164 --> 00:35.266
JUST IN CASE SOMEBODY SHOULD TRY
TO COME IN HERE AND HURT YOU,

00:35.266 --> 00:38.769
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR FATHER
AND I KEEP THE GUN?
 BUT IT WAS THE VICTIM...

00:38.769 --> 00:42.073
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING,
DATING A MARRIED MAN?
 WHO HAD SECRETS.

00:42.073 --> 00:44.075
HEY, JULIE, I MISS YOU.

00:48.349 --> 00:51.051
(Mary Alice)
IT IS IN OUR NATURE

00:51.051 --> 00:53.754
TO JUDGE THE PEOPLE AROUND US.

00:55.156 --> 00:58.789
WE JUDGE
THE WAY STRANGERS DRESS...

01:00.831 --> 01:04.095
THE WAY OUR NEIGHBORS
TEND THEIR LAWNS...

01:04.095 --> 01:06.267
(Lee and Bob
shouting indistinctly)

01:06.267 --> 01:10.101
AND THE WAY
OUR FRIENDS ACT IN PUBLIC.

01:10.101 --> 01:11.602
(shouting continues)

01:11.602 --> 01:15.476
YES, WE MAKE THESE JUDGMENTS
ALL THE TIME,

01:15.476 --> 01:18.549
NEVER THINKING THAT ONE DAY

01:18.549 --> 01:20.481
WE MAY BE JUDGED...

01:20.481 --> 01:23.184
OURSELVES.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.555
(footsteps running)

01:24.555 --> 01:27.288
(thud)
 (girl) OW!

01:28.789 --> 01:31.562
GIRLS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:31.562 --> 01:34.094
OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE.
 MY ARM.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.527
WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT
SLIDING DOWN THE STAIRCASE?

01:36.527 --> 01:40.601
NOT TO USE THE GOOD SUITCASE?
 BESIDES THAT.
DON'T DO IT AT ALL!

01:40.601 --> 01:42.603
WELL, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

01:42.603 --> 01:44.835
YOU WON'T LET US PLAY
ON THE ROOF ANYMORE.

01:44.835 --> 01:47.278
(knocks on door)
 (under breath) OH, CRAP.

01:47.278 --> 01:49.640
(normal voice) HEY, LAURA!
 WHAT HAPPENED?

01:49.640 --> 01:52.443
(Gabrielle) DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S OKAY.

01:52.443 --> 01:54.715
THESE TWO KNUCKLEHEADS DECIDED
TO SLIDE DOWN THE STAIRCASE.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.888
WHY WOULD YOU LET THEM
DO THAT?
 OH, DON'T BLAME ME.
I WASN'T EVEN IN THE ROOM.

01:57.888 --> 02:00.120
YOU LEFT THE GIRLS
UNSUPERVISED?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.753
WELL, THEY WERE PLAYING.

02:02.753 --> 02:05.296
COME ON. I CAN'T WATCH 'EM
EVERY SECOND.

02:05.296 --> 02:08.158
WHY NOT? I LOOK AFTER JUANITA
WHEN SHE'S AT MY HOUSE,

02:08.158 --> 02:10.161
AND SHE GOES HOME
WITHOUT A SCRATCH.

02:10.161 --> 02:12.163
(chuckles) ONLY 'CAUSE
SHE'S INDESTRUCTIBLE.

02:12.163 --> 02:14.535
HONEY, DO THAT THING
WHERE YOU RUN INTO THE WALL.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.837
WATCH. THIS IS HILARIOUS.
 YOU'RE PRETTY CAVALIER

02:16.837 --> 02:19.870
CONSIDERING YOUR CARELESSNESS
ALMOST KILLED MY DAUGHTER.

02:22.713 --> 02:25.216
(scoffs)

02:25.216 --> 02:27.248
I GOTTA SAY, LAURA,

02:27.248 --> 02:30.451
YOU'RE KIND OF A WET BLANKET
SINCE YOU QUIT SMOKING.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.453
WHY DON'T YOU TRY A PIPE?

02:32.453 --> 02:34.685
AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, GABY,

02:34.685 --> 02:37.528
I THINK
YOU'RE A LOUSY MOTHER.

02:37.528 --> 02:40.461
DID YOU JUST SAY THAT
TO MY FACE?
 YES, AND I'M AFRAID

02:40.461 --> 02:43.163
I WON'T BE BRINGING
MY DAUGHTER HERE ANYMORE.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.867
THE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING
OF MY CHILD MUST COME FIRST.
 FINE.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.870
JUANITA ONLY HAD RACHEL OVER
BECAUSE SHE FELT SORRY FOR HER.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.373
IT WAS A PITY PLAYDATE.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.375
AND OF COURSE THIS MEANS

02:54.375 --> 02:57.408
RACHEL WON'T BE ATTENDING
JUANITA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

02:57.408 --> 03:00.211
MORE CAKE FOR US! BEAT IT!

03:00.211 --> 03:02.283
LET'S GO, SWEETIE.

03:02.283 --> 03:07.918
YES, IT'S IN OUR NATURE
TO JUDGE THOSE AROUND US.

03:07.918 --> 03:10.391
IT'S ALSO IN OUR NATURE...

03:10.391 --> 03:12.893
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU HAD TAUGHT YOUR KID

03:12.893 --> 03:15.396
HOW TO TUCK AND ROLL
ON IMPACT,

03:15.396 --> 03:17.898
WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION!

03:17.898 --> 03:31.642
TO BLAME SOMEONE ELSE
FOR OUR MISTAKES.

03:31.642 --> 03:33.644
IT HAD BEEN TWO WEEKS

03:33.644 --> 03:37.217
SINCE JULIE MAYER
HAD BEEN ATTACKED.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.990
AND WHEN SHE CAME HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL,

03:39.990 --> 03:45.956
THE RESIDENTS OF WISTERIA LANE
WERE THERE TO WELCOME HER BACK.

03:45.956 --> 03:49.600
SHE WAS GREETED BY CHILDREN
WHO CAME WITH SIGNS...

03:51.962 --> 03:55.906
HOUSEWIVES WHO CAME
WITH DESSERTS...

03:55.906 --> 03:58.639
AND OLD FRIENDS

03:58.639 --> 04:02.242
WHO CAME WITH FLOWERS.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.876
ALSO IN THE CROWD
WAS A NEW FRIEND...

04:05.876 --> 04:09.820
WHO CAME WITH AN AGENDA.

04:11.322 --> 04:12.823
YOU LOOK GREAT, JULIE.

04:12.823 --> 04:14.825
I'M SO GLAD YOU GUYS CAME.

04:14.825 --> 04:16.327
SEE YOU LATER.
 BYE!

04:16.327 --> 04:17.458
BYE.

04:22.493 --> 04:23.994
HEY, JULIE.

04:23.994 --> 04:25.896
WELCOME HOME.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.803
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

04:32.803 --> 04:35.806
IS THERE SOMEPLACE WE CAN GO
WHERE WE CAN TALK?

04:35.806 --> 04:38.309
NO. WE'RE NOT DOING THIS
ANYMORE.

04:38.309 --> 04:40.351
JULIE, PLEASE.

04:40.351 --> 04:42.653
DOMINICK, I'M SORRY.

04:42.653 --> 04:43.984
IT'S OVER.

04:45.416 --> 04:47.988
HEY, MRS. McCLUSKEY!

04:58.369 --> 05:01.071
(Gabrielle) BREE.

05:01.071 --> 05:04.775
OH, HI.
I AM SO SORRY I'M LATE.

05:04.775 --> 05:06.777
I HAVE THREE PARTIES
THIS WEEKEND,

05:06.777 --> 05:09.580
AND I'M UP TO MY ELBOWS
IN CANAPÃ©S.
 WHY ISN'T KATHERINE
HELPING YOU?

05:09.580 --> 05:12.983
I HAD TO LET HER GO.
 WHAT?

05:12.983 --> 05:15.986
(Lynette) YOU'RE KIDDING.
 WE WERE WORKING THIS EVENT,
AND SHE WENT BERSERK.

05:15.986 --> 05:17.988
AND THEN WHEN I FIRED HER,

05:17.988 --> 05:20.451
SHE INTENTIONALLY SCRATCHED
MY CAR.

05:20.451 --> 05:22.453
WOW. I FLIPPED HER THE BIRD
THE OTHER DAY

05:22.453 --> 05:25.596
AFTER SHE CUT ME OFF.
WON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

05:25.596 --> 05:27.728
I THINK SHE NEEDS HELP.
 I THINK SHE'S A DRAMA QUEEN.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.030
BUT IF SHE IS IN TROUBLE,
AND WE DON'T DO ANYTHING,

05:30.030 --> 05:32.032
IT COULD BE MARY ALICE
ALL OVER AGAIN.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.065
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW.
SUSAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:35.065 --> 05:37.067
WELL, I KNOW SHE'S GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH TIME,

05:37.067 --> 05:38.939
BUT I HAVE TROUBLE
FEELING SORRY FOR HER.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.342
I GET THAT, AFTER THAT STUNT
SHE PULLED AT YOUR WEDDING.
 (Bree) TRUE.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.646
AND DID YOU TELL THEM ABOUT
KATHERINE HITTING ON MIKE?

05:45.646 --> 05:47.948
WHAT?
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

05:52.953 --> 05:55.656
HE--HE DID MENTION IT,
DIDN'T HE?

05:55.656 --> 05:59.730
OF COURSE. YEAH. UM, WE LAUGH
ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

05:59.730 --> 06:02.863
(chuckles) UM, OH,
AND LOOK. THERE'S MIKE NOW,

06:02.863 --> 06:05.135
AND I COULD USE A GOOD LAUGH.

06:05.135 --> 06:06.997
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

06:08.969 --> 06:12.042
SWEETIE, CAN I TALK TO YOU
A SECOND?

06:12.042 --> 06:14.805
IF IT WAS NO BIG DEAL,
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME?

06:14.805 --> 06:16.807
JULIE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

06:16.807 --> 06:18.649
I DIDN'T TELL YOU

06:18.649 --> 06:21.952
BECAUSE I, CRAZY ME,
THOUGHT IT MIGHT UPSET YOU.
 AND HERE'S WHY I'M UPSET--

06:21.952 --> 06:24.384
'CAUSE NOW I REALIZE
THAT KATHERINE IS NOT HURTING.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.386
SHE'S PLOTTING. SO I'M GONNA
GO OVER THERE RIGHT NOW--

06:26.386 --> 06:29.019
NO, SUSAN, YOU DO NOT WANT
TO POUR GASOLINE ON THIS FIRE.

06:29.019 --> 06:31.391
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT. I WANNA
POUR GASOLINE ON KATHERINE.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.724
AND IF YOU LOVE ME AT ALL,

06:33.724 --> 06:37.728
YOU'LL GIVE ME A MATCH
AND AN ALIBI.
 HONEY, LET HER HAVE HER LIES.
LET HER PLOT.

06:37.728 --> 06:39.730
OH, YOU GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

06:39.730 --> 06:42.633
YOU MEAN EVERYTHING TO ME,
AND KATHERINE MEANS NOTHING.

06:42.633 --> 06:45.405
WELL, THAT'S SWEET.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.407
I'M GONNA GO TELL HER
YOU SAID THAT.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.079
GET BACK HERE.

06:49.079 --> 06:50.481
(laughs)

06:54.985 --> 06:57.087
HEY.

06:57.087 --> 06:59.089
WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?

06:59.089 --> 07:00.491
YEAH, SURE.

07:00.491 --> 07:03.093
LET'S--LET'S HAVE
A NICE FATHER/SON CHAT

07:03.093 --> 07:05.095
ABOUT HOW
YOU'RE CHEATIN' ON MOM.

07:05.095 --> 07:07.097
DO YOU KNOW
HOW STUPID I FELT?

07:07.097 --> 07:09.099
I GOT INTO A HUGE FIGHT
WITH JULIE

07:09.099 --> 07:11.101
'CAUSE I THOUGHT
SHE WAS LYING TO ME,

07:11.101 --> 07:14.104
THAT SHE WAS JUST TELLING ME SHE
HAD A BOYFRIEND TO BLOW ME OFF.

07:14.104 --> 07:16.967
AND I FOLLOWED HER HOME,
AND...

07:16.967 --> 07:20.571
IT TURNS OUT SHE DOES HAVE
A BOYFRIEND--YOU.

07:20.571 --> 07:23.744
I'M SORRY.

07:23.744 --> 07:27.447
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
IT'S OVER.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.952
IF I EVER SEE
YOU TWO TOGETHER AGAIN...

07:33.854 --> 07:35.526
I'M GONNA TELL MOM.

07:39.630 --> 07:42.563
YOU WANNA TELL YOUR MOTHER?

07:42.563 --> 07:44.064
YEAH, COME ON.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.597
LET'S GO RIGHT NOW.
COME ON.

07:46.597 --> 07:48.098
WHAT?

07:48.098 --> 07:51.572
YOU THINK YOU CAN DANGLE
THAT AX OVER MY HEAD?

07:51.572 --> 07:53.043
THEN GO FOR IT.

07:53.043 --> 07:57.077
SO YOU WANT MOM TO KNOW?

07:57.077 --> 07:59.079
YOU WANT TO DESTROY
HER LIFE?

07:59.079 --> 08:02.683
YOUR MOM FINDING OUT THAT I HAD
AN AFFAIR WON'T DESTROY HER.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.686
HER FINDING OUT THAT YOU KNEW
ABOUT IT? YEAH, THAT WILL.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.988
YEAH, I'M THE BAD GUY.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.992
YOU THINK YOUR MOM'S
THE PERFECT ONE

08:11.992 --> 08:14.024
IN THIS MARRIAGE?

08:14.024 --> 08:16.026
THERE YOU TWO ARE.

08:16.026 --> 08:18.869
THEY'RE BRINGING OUT A CAKE
FOR JULIE.

08:20.531 --> 08:22.603
EVERYTHING OKAY OUT HERE?

08:24.935 --> 08:26.076
YEAH.

08:27.738 --> 08:30.641
JUST HAVING
A LITTLE FATHER/SON CHAT.

08:30.641 --> 08:34.585
THAT'S MY BOYS. OH, COME ON.
THEY'RE CUTTIN' THE CAKE.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.195
(sighs)

08:51.031 --> 08:53.834
(knocks on door)
 COME IN!

08:53.834 --> 08:55.936
HEY, KAREN.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.938
LYNETTE, WHEN YOU'VE NEEDED
A FAVOR FROM ME,

08:57.938 --> 08:59.940
HAVE I EVER LET YOU DOWN?

08:59.940 --> 09:02.012
LAST MONTH WE NEEDED
A SITTER FOR PENNY,

09:02.012 --> 09:04.174
BUT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO MISS
OKTOBERFEST.

09:04.174 --> 09:06.176
AND JUST LAST THURSDAY--
 OKAY, NEW WAY IN.

09:06.176 --> 09:09.219
I GOT A PROBLEM WITH ROY.
HE'S BEEN KINDA DOWN LATELY.

09:09.219 --> 09:12.222
OH, WHAT'S WRONG?
 HE LIVES ON A FIXED INCOME

09:12.222 --> 09:15.185
AND HE CAN'T AFFORD
TO PAY FOR NICE DINNERS.

09:15.185 --> 09:18.158
BUT WHEN I PAY, HE SULKS.
HE SAYS I'M "KEEPING" HIM.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.130
HELL, AT HIS AGE,
HE SHOULD BE GLAD

09:20.130 --> 09:22.633
TO HAVE SOMETHING KEEPING HIM
BESIDES FORMALDEHYDE.

09:22.633 --> 09:26.136
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 AND THE FAVOR WOULD BE?

09:26.136 --> 09:28.138
WELL, I WAS THINKING
MAYBE YOU AND TOM

09:28.138 --> 09:31.141
COULD HIRE HIM FOR A FEW HOURS
A WEEK AS A HANDYMAN.

09:31.141 --> 09:35.105
YOU KNOW, SO HE'D HAVE
A LITTLE WALKING AROUND MONEY.

09:35.105 --> 09:37.277
GEE, I DON'T KNOW.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.110
OKAY, GIRL TALK TIME.

09:40.110 --> 09:43.884
WHEN ROY'S SPIRITS ARE DROOPING,
THE PROBLEM IS GLOBAL.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.016
YOU GET THE PICTURE?

09:46.016 --> 09:48.018
GETTING THE PICTURE
ISN'T THE PROBLEM.

09:48.018 --> 09:51.021
IT'S GETTING RID OF IT.
 OH, COME ON.
TRY HIM FOR ONE WEEK.

09:51.021 --> 09:53.163
I'M ONLY HESITANT
BECAUSE HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND,

09:53.163 --> 09:56.266
AND I'D HATE TO RISK
STRAINING A GOOD FRIENDSHIP.

09:56.266 --> 09:58.268
WELL, IF I WERE
THAT GOOD A FRIEND,

09:58.268 --> 10:01.001
WOULD I BE PUTTING YOU
IN THIS AWKWARD POSITION?

10:01.001 --> 10:03.774
(chuckles) EXCELLENT POINT.

10:03.774 --> 10:05.075
HE'S HIRED.

10:05.075 --> 10:08.809
THANKS. YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT
YOU'VE DONE FOR MY SEX LIFE.

10:10.981 --> 10:12.813
GOOD.

10:17.087 --> 10:19.690
(humming)

10:19.690 --> 10:21.091
HMM.

10:21.091 --> 10:23.153
(chuckles) I LOVE IT
THAT YOU DO THAT.

10:23.153 --> 10:24.154
WHAT?

10:24.154 --> 10:26.156
WHEN I FIRST
BROUGHT YOU HERE,

10:26.156 --> 10:28.659
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SET FOOT
IN THIS ROOM.

10:28.659 --> 10:31.662
AND NOW YOU GET SAD
EVERY TIME WE HAVE TO LEAVE.

10:31.662 --> 10:35.065
(chuckles) WELL,
IT'S NOW OUR PLACE.

10:35.065 --> 10:38.368
IT'S NOT WHAT I WOULD'VE CHOSEN,
BUT IT'S GROWING ON ME.
 (laughs)

10:41.912 --> 10:43.914
(Jamaican accent) I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT YOU CHECKED OUT.

10:43.914 --> 10:46.717
MM.
 (chuckles) IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE JUST GOING.

10:46.717 --> 10:48.178
TIP'S ON THE DRESSER.

10:48.178 --> 10:50.180
THANK YOU, SIR.
 MM-HMM.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.858
EXCUSE ME.

10:57.858 --> 11:01.061
UM, I SEEM TO HAVE LOST
AN EARRING--A LITTLE PEARL STUD.

11:01.061 --> 11:04.234
OH. I CAN HELP YOU
LOOK FOR IT.

11:04.234 --> 11:05.435
THANK YOU.

11:05.435 --> 11:07.097
(cell phone rings)
 OH.

11:07.097 --> 11:09.199
(beep)
 HELLO?

11:09.199 --> 11:11.671
OH, HI, ORSON.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.245
NO, I TOLD YOU YOUR GRAY SUIT
IS AT THE TAILOR'S.

11:15.245 --> 11:18.148
WHERE AM I NOW?

11:18.148 --> 11:22.082
OH, AT THE SUPERMARKET
GETTING US SOMETHING FOR DINNER.

11:22.082 --> 11:25.055
OH, YOU ALREADY DID
ALL THE SHOPPING? WELL, GREAT.

11:25.055 --> 11:28.759
I WILL JUST PUT ALL THIS FOOD
AWAY AND COME STRAIGHT HOME.

11:28.759 --> 11:30.190
BYE.
 (beep)

11:30.190 --> 11:31.722
HMM.

11:31.722 --> 11:34.895
FOUND IT.
IT WAS BURIED IN THE SHEETS.

11:34.895 --> 11:38.128
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME
GET YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.233
OH, MY WALLET'S HERE
SOMEWHERE.

11:43.233 --> 11:45.235
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

11:45.235 --> 11:48.779
I'M SURE YOU'RE EAGER
 TO GET HOME TO YOUR HUSBAND.

12:05.295 --> 12:08.198
OH, OKAY. WELL,
THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW.

12:08.198 --> 12:10.200
(beep)
 (sighs)

12:10.200 --> 12:11.902
WHAT'S WRONG?

12:11.902 --> 12:14.905
HEIDI BREMER JUST INFORMED ME
HER KID CAN'T COME ON SATURDAY.

12:14.905 --> 12:17.267
SHE AND DON ARE GOING
TO THE NURSING HOME

12:17.267 --> 12:19.339
TO VISIT HIS MOTHER.
 SO WHY ARE YOU MAD?

12:19.339 --> 12:22.142
BECAUSE IT'S A LIE!
HEIDI HATES HIS MOTHER!

12:22.142 --> 12:25.145
SHE WOULDN'T CROSS THE STREET
TO VISIT THAT DROOLING FOSSIL.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.147
AND THAT'S THE THIRD
CANCELLATION I'VE GOTTEN TODAY,

12:27.147 --> 12:29.149
AND EVERY EXCUSE
HAS BEEN A CROCK.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.451
WHY WOULD PEOPLE LIE
TO GET OUT OF A KID'S PARTY?

12:31.451 --> 12:34.424
BECAUSE LAURA MILLER'S OUT THERE
SPREADING HER POISON.

12:34.424 --> 12:36.957
SHE'S TELLING EVERY WOMAN
IN THE P.T.A.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.959
THEIR KIDS AREN'T SAFE
IN MY HOUSE.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.191
THOSE HAUSFRAU CRONIES OF HERS
ARE LAPPING IT UP.

12:41.191 --> 12:43.463
JUANITA WILL BE HEARTBROKEN
IF NO ONE COMES TO HER PARTY.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.465
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THEY'LL COME.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.138
WE JUST HAVE TO BUILD IT,
THAT'S ALL.

12:48.138 --> 12:50.971
THIS IS ABOUT TO COST ME MONEY,
ISN'T IT?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.973
CARLOS, THERE ARE WOMEN
OUT THERE

12:52.973 --> 12:55.976
WHO THINK I'M A BAD MOTHER.
IT IS YOUR JOB TO SUPPORT ME.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.408
NOW JUST SHUT UP
AND FORK OVER SOME CASH.
 (sighs deeply)

12:58.408 --> 13:02.953
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER TO JUST
WATCH THE KIDS WHILE THEY PLAY?

13:02.953 --> 13:06.256
DID YOU JUST SAY THAT
TO MY FACE?

13:06.256 --> 13:09.259
HERE.
TAKE THE WHOLE WALLET.

13:09.259 --> 13:11.221
(scoffs)

13:14.394 --> 13:17.097
VOILÃ . GRILLED LANGOUSTINE.
YOUR FAVORITE.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.100
HOW VERY THOUGHTFUL
OF YOU, ORSON.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.102
WELL, THEY WEREN'T EASY
TO FIND.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.175
THE MAN AT ONE STORE
TRIED TO SELL ME SHRIMP.

13:25.175 --> 13:27.107
AND WHEN I TRIED TO EXPLAIN
THE DIFFERENCE,

13:27.107 --> 13:29.509
HE GAVE ME AN ARGUMENT.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.511
WHAT IS IT WITH SERVICE PEOPLE
THESE DAYS?

13:31.511 --> 13:34.084
THEY USED TO BE POLITE
AND DEFERENTIAL.

13:34.084 --> 13:37.047
NOW THEY JUST SNEER
RIGHT IN YOUR FACE.

13:37.047 --> 13:38.348
IT'S INTOLERABLE.

13:38.348 --> 13:41.221
WELL, I WOULDN'T LET IT SPOIL
A NICE DINNER.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.994
SORRY, I HAD A VERY IRKSOME
ENCOUNTER MYSELF TODAY.

13:43.994 --> 13:46.056
REALLY? WHERE?

13:46.056 --> 13:48.929
AT A... CAFÃ©.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.102
I WAS HAVING LUNCH,

13:52.102 --> 13:55.205
AND THIS WAITRESS
WAS RUDE AND SUPERIOR.

13:55.205 --> 13:57.067
SUPERIOR? TO YOU?

13:57.067 --> 13:59.069
WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE
WHIPPED OUT

13:59.069 --> 14:01.141
A COPY
OF YOUR BEST-SELLING COOKBOOK,

14:01.141 --> 14:03.874
LIKE YOU DID LAST WEEK
IN THE FOOD COURT AT THE MALL.

14:03.874 --> 14:06.116
WELL, I DOUBT THIS WOMAN
WOULD'VE BEEN IMPRESSED.

14:06.116 --> 14:09.479
REALLY? WELL, YOU SURE PUT THAT
PRETZEL VENDOR IN HIS PLACE.

14:09.479 --> 14:12.182
I WAS SO STARTLED,
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

14:12.182 --> 14:14.184
I JUST LET IT GO.

14:14.184 --> 14:16.156
WELL, IS THIS A CAFÃ©
YOU FREQUENT OFTEN?

14:16.156 --> 14:20.130
AS OFTEN AS I CAN.
 WELL, NEXT TIME
YOU'RE IN THERE,

14:20.130 --> 14:22.132
I THINK YOU SHOULD
CLEAR THE AIR.

14:22.132 --> 14:23.533
DEMAND A LITTLE COURTESY.

14:23.533 --> 14:25.235
THANK YOU, ORSON.

14:25.235 --> 14:28.198
I THINK I MAY
DO THAT TOMORROW.

14:28.198 --> 14:31.071
THIS IS NICE, ISN'T IT?

14:31.071 --> 14:33.143
SHARING A MEAL,
TALKING ABOUT OUR DAYS.

14:33.143 --> 14:35.645
WHY DON'T YOU PASS
ON THAT CAFÃ© TOMORROW

14:35.645 --> 14:38.648
AND LET ME MAKE YOU
A NICE SALAD OR AN OMELET?

14:38.648 --> 14:40.310
THANK YOU, DEAR,

14:40.310 --> 14:44.985
BUT TOMORROW I'M PLANNING ON
HAVING SOMETHING A BIT SPICIER.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.556
LYNETTE.

14:46.556 --> 14:47.918
YEAH?

14:47.918 --> 14:49.920
LOOK WHAT ROY DID.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.322
OPEN. CLOSED. OPEN! CLOSED!

14:52.322 --> 14:55.025
WE DON'T NEED TO USE
THAT SPATULA ANYMORE!

14:55.025 --> 14:56.967
(laughs) THAT'S GREAT!

14:56.967 --> 15:00.070
SO, ROY,
SINCE YOU'RE SO INGENIOUS,

15:00.070 --> 15:02.132
HOW ABOUT YOU BUILD
SOME FLOWER BOXES

15:02.132 --> 15:05.505
FOR OUR BEDROOM WINDOWS?
 WELL, OUR WINDOW IF YOU WANT,
BUT NOT THE KIDS'.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.938
WHY NOT?
 'CAUSE THEY'LL NEVER
WATER 'EM.

15:07.938 --> 15:11.942
OH, I'LL REMIND THEM.
 THEY CAN'T KEEP A GOLDFISH ALIVE
FOR MORE THAN ONE DAY.

15:11.942 --> 15:13.413
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

15:13.413 --> 15:15.915
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE BETTER CARE
OF GERANIUMS?

15:15.915 --> 15:19.249
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST KNOW
WE'RE GETTING FLOWER BOXES.

15:19.249 --> 15:22.252
SO, ROY, YOU COULD GO AHEAD
AND GET THOSE STARTED.

15:22.252 --> 15:27.057
ARE YOU GOOD WITH THIS,
MR. SCAVO?

15:27.057 --> 15:28.528
SURE. WHAT THE HELL.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.700
OKAY, I'LL GO MEASURE
THE WINDOWS.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.362
THANKS, ROY.

15:32.362 --> 15:34.434
(door opens and closes)

15:34.434 --> 15:37.407
WHAT WAS THAT?
 WHAT?

15:37.407 --> 15:39.439
HE JUST WENT OVER MY HEAD
TO YOU.

15:39.439 --> 15:43.273
I KNEW I LIKED THAT GUY
THE MINUTE HE WALKED IN.

15:43.273 --> 15:44.414
LOOK!

15:44.414 --> 15:46.216
OPEN. CLOSED.

15:46.216 --> 15:49.249
OPEN! CLOSED!

15:52.552 --> 15:55.585
(children speaking indistinctly
and laughing)

15:55.585 --> 15:58.158
HI, LAURA, KIRSTIN, HEIDI.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.130
(woman) HI.
 GABRIELLE.

16:00.130 --> 16:03.163
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE, LAURA.
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.165
THINGS GOT A LITTLE HEATED
THE OTHER DAY,

16:05.165 --> 16:07.167
AND I THINK WE BOTH SAID
SOME THINGS WE DIDN'T MEAN.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.169
I APPRECIATE THAT, GABRIELLE.

16:09.169 --> 16:12.002
GOOD. WELL...

16:12.002 --> 16:14.004
NOW THAT THAT'S BEHIND US,

16:14.004 --> 16:17.007
IF RACHEL WOULD LIKE TO COME
TO JUANITA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY,

16:17.007 --> 16:19.009
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE HER.

16:19.009 --> 16:22.552
SORRY, BUT I'M STILL NOT
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.
 OH, THAT'S A SHAME.

16:22.552 --> 16:26.186
WE'RE GONNA HAVE FACE PAINTING
AND A COTTON CANDY MACHINE...

16:26.186 --> 16:29.359
(loudly) AND A CLOWN.
 A CLOWN?! WHERE'S A CLOWN?!

16:29.359 --> 16:32.322
OH, NOT HERE, SWEETIE. HE'LL BE
AT JUANITA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY

16:32.322 --> 16:35.995
ON SATURDAY--THE ONE YOUR MOMMY
WON'T LET YOU GO TO.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.568
I WANNA GO!
 RACHEL, WE'LL TALK
ABOUT IT LATER.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.173
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GABY?

16:43.173 --> 16:46.206
OH, I'M SORRY. SHE ASKED ME
A QUESTION. I JUST ANSWERED IT.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.208
FOR EXAMPLE,
IF SHE WERE TO ASK ME

16:48.208 --> 16:50.710
IF WE WERE HAVING
A BOUNCY HOUSE, I'D HAVE TO SAY,

16:50.710 --> 16:53.213
"JUST THE BIGGEST BOUNCY HOUSE
YOU'VE EVER SEEN!"

16:53.213 --> 16:55.615
OH, A BOUNCY HOUSE!
I LOVE BOUNCY HOUSES!
 (girl) YEAH, I WANT--

16:55.615 --> 16:57.647
IS THE CLOWN GONNA
BE IN THE BOUNCY HOUSE?

16:57.647 --> 17:00.250
MAYBE,
BUT YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

17:00.250 --> 17:03.293
GABRIELLE, PLEASE.

17:03.293 --> 17:05.525
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.
THIS IS CRUEL.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.328
COME ON, JUANITA.
WE GOTTA BUY BANANAS.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.329
THE PEOPLE AT YOUR PARTY

17:10.329 --> 17:12.462
ARE GONNA WANT SOMETHING
TO FEED THE MONKEY.
 (girls gasp)

17:12.462 --> 17:14.733
A MONKEY?!
 MOMMY! MOMMY! MOMMY!

17:14.733 --> 17:16.435
I WANNA GO!
 (girl) PRETTY PLEASE!

17:16.435 --> 17:18.208
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.609
PLEASE? PLEASE? PLEASE?
IT'S NOT FAIR!

17:20.609 --> 17:23.173
(girl) I WANNA GO!
 (girls whining)

17:31.181 --> 17:32.682
(knock on door)

17:32.682 --> 17:34.284
EXCUSE ME?

17:34.284 --> 17:37.757
DID YOU NEED SOMETHING
IN YOUR ROOM?

17:37.757 --> 17:41.091
AH, NO, I'M NOT CHECKED IN.
I CAME HERE TO SEE YOU.

17:41.091 --> 17:43.333
I DON'T HAVE ANY WEED,
LADY.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.294
SORRY?

17:44.294 --> 17:46.696
ALL YOU LADIES
WITH THE NICE CARS

17:46.696 --> 17:49.699
THINKS ANYONE WHO TALKS LIKE
THIS MUST HAVE GANJA TO SELL.

17:49.699 --> 17:51.771
I AM NOT HERE TO BUY GANJA.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.443
I CAME ABOUT YESTERDAY.

17:53.443 --> 17:56.246
I APPRECIATED YOU
FINDING MY EARRING,

17:56.246 --> 17:59.078
BUT I DIDN'T CARE
FOR YOUR ATTITUDE.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.211
IT WAS VERY INSULTING.

18:01.211 --> 18:03.653
DID I SAY
ONE CROSS WORD TO YOU?

18:03.653 --> 18:05.315
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO.

18:05.315 --> 18:08.718
YOUR DISDAIN WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR
FROM THE LOOK YOU GAVE ME.

18:08.718 --> 18:11.561
AND THERE IS IT AGAIN.

18:11.561 --> 18:14.664
(scoffs) I HAVE 12 ROOMS TO DO.
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO ARGUE.

18:14.664 --> 18:17.197
FINE. THEN I'LL HELP.

18:19.629 --> 18:22.202
LADY, PLEASE.

18:22.202 --> 18:25.305
I WON'T LOOK AT YOU
NO MORE, OKAY?
 I'M JUST SAYING

18:25.305 --> 18:28.308
YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE
SNAP JUDGMENTS ABOUT PEOPLE.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.310
YOU SEE I'M HAVING AN AFFAIR,

18:30.310 --> 18:33.343
AND YOU JUST ASSUME I'M A BAD
PERSON... AND A DOPE FIEND.

18:33.343 --> 18:35.845
IF YOU KNEW MORE
ABOUT MY MARRIAGE,

18:35.845 --> 18:37.847
YOU'D SEE ME
VERY DIFFERENTLY.

18:37.847 --> 18:41.391
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE.

18:41.391 --> 18:45.395
IF YOU'RE GOING TO FORM OPINIONS
ABOUT IT, THEN YES, YOU DO.

18:45.395 --> 18:48.398
MY HUSBAND IS
A CONTROLLING EX-CON.

18:48.398 --> 18:51.401
I'VE BEGGED HIM FOR A DIVORCE,
BUT HE WON'T LET ME GO.

18:51.401 --> 18:54.464
I'M PRACTICALLY HIS PRISONER.
 YOUR HUSBAND'S A GOOD MAN.

18:54.464 --> 18:56.506
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM.

18:56.506 --> 18:58.638
I KNOW HE DOES YOUR SHOPPING
FOR YOU.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.371
WHEN YOU LIED TO HIM
ON THE PHONE,

19:01.371 --> 19:03.373
TOLD HIM YOU WERE
AT THE GROCERY STORE.

19:03.373 --> 19:05.275
HE SAID HE ALREADY WENT.

19:05.275 --> 19:07.917
AND YOUR POINT IS?
 YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD GIVE

19:07.917 --> 19:10.320
TO HAVE A MAN
DO MY SHOPPING FOR ME,

19:10.320 --> 19:12.282
MAKE MY LIFE
A LITTLE BIT EASIER?

19:12.282 --> 19:15.285
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN GRATEFUL.
YOU'RE JUST SNEAKING OFF HERE

19:15.285 --> 19:17.627
TO DO THE NASTY
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.

19:17.627 --> 19:19.629
WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE ME?

19:19.629 --> 19:21.861
YOU CAN'T EVEN MAKE
HOSPITAL CORNERS!

19:21.861 --> 19:24.364
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY,
LADY, HUH?

19:24.364 --> 19:27.637
THAT CHEATING'S NOT A SIN
WHEN YOU DO IT IN PEARLS?

19:27.637 --> 19:30.740
NOW UNLESS YOU WANT TO START ON
THE TOILET, I THINK WE'RE DONE.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.255
WOW.

19:45.255 --> 19:47.857
THESE FLOWER BOXES
ARE REALLY COMING ALONG.

19:47.857 --> 19:49.859
IF YOU HAVE A MOMENT--
NO RUSH--

19:49.859 --> 19:52.362
WOULD YOU HANG THIS BIRDHOUSE
FOR ME?

19:52.362 --> 19:54.594
I WAS THINKING
ON THAT BIG TREE.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.266
YOU GOT IT.

19:56.266 --> 19:57.827
OH, THANKS.

19:57.827 --> 19:59.599
ROY?

19:59.599 --> 20:01.271
OVER THERE. THAT TREE.

20:01.271 --> 20:04.574
YEAH, I WAS TALKING TO TOM
ABOUT IT THIS MORNING,

20:04.574 --> 20:07.307
AND, UH, HE WANTS IT
OVER HERE.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.309
OKAY, WELL,
THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE

20:09.309 --> 20:11.611
HE FORGOT THE SPRINKLERS
GO OFF OVER THERE.

20:11.611 --> 20:15.345
SO DO ME A FAVOR
AND HANG IT IN THAT TREE.

20:15.345 --> 20:17.587
THANK YOU.

20:20.820 --> 20:25.395
(speaking indistinctly)

20:28.958 --> 20:30.960
'CAUSE SHE'S TELLING ME
SHE WANTS IT

20:30.960 --> 20:32.962
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE YARD.

20:32.962 --> 20:34.804
ROY?
 GOTTA GO.

20:34.804 --> 20:37.437
BOY, YOU'RE EVERYWHERE.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.439
WE SHOULD GET YOU A BELL.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.010
WHY YOU CALLING TOM?

20:41.010 --> 20:44.013
TO MAKE SURE HE'S OKAY WITH
WHERE YOU WANNA HANG THIS THING.

20:44.013 --> 20:46.746
I MEAN, HE IS
THE MAN OF THE HOUSE.

20:46.746 --> 20:50.420
OKAY, I KNOW,
SINCE YOU'RE USING A CELL PHONE,

20:50.420 --> 20:53.423
YOU KNOW WHAT CENTURY IT IS,
BUT JUST TO CLARIFY--

20:53.423 --> 20:55.425
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
KEEP CHECKING WITH TOM.

20:55.425 --> 20:57.427
I MAKE PLENTY OF DECISIONS
AROUND HERE.

20:57.427 --> 20:58.928
I NOTICED.

20:58.928 --> 21:02.292
I JUST PREFER TO TREAT THE GUY
WITH A LITTLE RESPECT.

21:02.292 --> 21:03.863
EXCUSE ME?

21:03.863 --> 21:07.467
JUST 'CAUSE YOU LIKE CRUNCHING
HIS WALNUTS DOESN'T MEAN I DO.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.599
I BEG YOUR PARDON!

21:09.599 --> 21:11.601
HIS WALNUTS
ARE COMPLETELY INTACT!

21:11.601 --> 21:15.044
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
WE ARE DONE HERE. YOU CAN GO.

21:15.044 --> 21:17.777
FINE. SOON AS I HANG
THIS BIRDHOUSE.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.780
OH, AND HE SAID
HE DOESN'T CARE WHERE IT IS,

21:20.780 --> 21:22.281
SO YOU WIN... AGAIN.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.783
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WINNING!

21:23.783 --> 21:27.286
AND I JUST FIRED YOU,
SO YOU CAN GO HOME.

21:27.286 --> 21:31.661
NO. I PROMISED TOM I'D DO THIS,
AND I'M DOING IT.
 YOU KNOW--

21:31.661 --> 21:33.363
(grunts)

21:38.828 --> 21:42.472
I'D CLEAN THAT UP,
BUT YOU JUST FIRED ME.

21:55.445 --> 21:57.447
(gasps)
 OH, MY GOD! I'M SO SORRY.

21:57.447 --> 21:59.849
OH!
 I THOUGHT YOU SAW ME.

21:59.849 --> 22:02.592
NO. UH, NO.
NO, IT'S--IT'S OKAY.

22:02.592 --> 22:05.495
I WAS JUST...

22:05.495 --> 22:08.327
YEAH, I SHOULDA REALIZED.
I'M SORRY.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.462
I GUESS YOU HEARD
THAT AFTER IT HAPPENED,

22:12.462 --> 22:13.963
SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT--

22:13.963 --> 22:16.936
OH, UM... I KNOW
IT WASN'T YOU, DANNY.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.643
HEY, THAT NIGHT WE ARGUED,

22:23.643 --> 22:26.646
YOU SAID
YOU WERE SEEING A GUY.

22:26.646 --> 22:30.119
YOU THINK MAYBE HE HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT?

22:30.119 --> 22:34.454
UM, I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
BUT NO.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.456
HE'S NOT THAT KIND OF GUY.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.458
SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA?

22:38.458 --> 22:40.760
I WISH I DID.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.433
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO SLEEP.

22:43.433 --> 22:45.835
EVERY TIME I'M ABOUT
TO CLOSE MY EYES,

22:45.835 --> 22:48.398
I'M AFRAID HE'LL BE THERE
WHEN I WAKE UP.

22:48.398 --> 22:51.801
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:51.801 --> 22:55.004
I THINK I MIGHT
HAVE SOMETHING TO HELP.

23:07.156 --> 23:09.489
(closes box)

23:09.489 --> 23:11.991
THANK YOU, ALL,
FOR VOLUNTEERING.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.493
HERE'S THE THING.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.995
WHOEVER ATTACKED JULIE
IS STILL OUT THERE,

23:15.995 --> 23:18.568
SO IT'S UP TO US TO LOOK OUT
FOR EACH OTHER,

23:18.568 --> 23:20.570
WHICH IS WHERE
THE NEIGHBOR WATCH COMES IN.

23:20.570 --> 23:23.132
SO SUSAN'S GONNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT PATROL DUTY.

23:23.132 --> 23:25.805
SUSAN?

23:29.008 --> 23:32.111
SUSAN?

23:37.086 --> 23:40.520
UH, WHAT IS SHE PATROLLING FOR?
HIS TONSILS?

23:44.123 --> 23:48.458
UM, WE STILL NEED PEOPLE FOR
9:00 TO MIDNIGHT ON THURSDAY.

23:48.458 --> 23:49.799
ANY VOLUNTEERS?

23:52.732 --> 23:55.705
(under breath)
"PROJECT RUNWAY."

23:57.637 --> 24:00.209
UH, OKAY,
WE HAVE, UH, MONA CLARKE...

24:01.911 --> 24:06.516
AND IRMA PRITCHET.

24:06.516 --> 24:08.117
NO ONE ELSE?

24:10.620 --> 24:12.652
OKAY, MEETING ADJOURNED.

24:12.652 --> 24:16.656
THERE'S COFFEE
BACK IN THE KITCHEN.

24:16.656 --> 24:20.490
(indistinct conversations)

24:20.490 --> 24:22.792
UH, MRS. PRITCHET'S GOT
A CLOGGED SHOWER DRAIN,

24:22.792 --> 24:25.595
AND I PROMISED
I'D FIX IT FOR HER.
 MMM.

24:27.767 --> 24:31.070
I DON'T THINK SHE SAW THAT ONE.
YOU WANNA DO IT AGAIN?

24:31.070 --> 24:33.072
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

24:34.904 --> 24:37.176
SUSAN?

24:37.176 --> 24:38.247
A WORD?

24:40.650 --> 24:44.153
DID YOU NOT SEE MY HAND UP?
I WAS TRYING TO VOLUNTEER.

24:44.153 --> 24:47.857
I SAW. I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PICK THE PEOPLE

24:47.857 --> 24:50.159
WHO I THOUGHT COULD BEST
PROTECT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

24:50.159 --> 24:53.963
SO YOU PICKED IRMA PRITCHET?
HER SON IS IN A NURSING HOME.

24:53.963 --> 24:57.196
YES, KATHERINE,
IRMA IS OLD,

24:57.196 --> 25:00.129
BUT SHE'S NOT
A BIG FAT LIAR.

25:00.129 --> 25:01.230
(scoffs) EXCUSE ME?

25:03.272 --> 25:05.274
WELL, ARE YOU NOT
 GOING AROUND

25:05.274 --> 25:07.607
SAYING THAT MY HUSBAND
HIT ON YOU?

25:07.607 --> 25:11.510
(laughs) SUSAN...

25:11.510 --> 25:14.183
I KNOW YOU'RE UNDER
A TERRIBLE STRAIN,

25:14.183 --> 25:17.186
BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO AIR...

25:17.186 --> 25:21.050
(whispers) YOUR DIRTY LAUNDRY
IN FRONT OF ALL THESE PEOPLE?

25:21.050 --> 25:23.052
YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH DIRTY LAUNDRY.

25:23.052 --> 25:26.626
MY LAUNDRY IS CLEAN, FOLDED
AND PUT AWAY, YOU LOON.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.528
UM, GIRLS?
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT HERE?

25:29.528 --> 25:31.901
NO, IT'S NOT.

25:31.901 --> 25:34.033
FIRST SHE CALLS ME A LIAR,

25:34.033 --> 25:36.235
AND NOW I'M A LOON.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.738
OKAY, YOU ALL HEARD THE THINGS
SHE WAS SAYING.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.770
YOU SAW THE WAY SHE ACTED
AT MY WEDDING.

25:40.770 --> 25:42.872
NOT EVERYONE WAS INVITED
TO YOUR WEDDING.

25:42.872 --> 25:46.215
JEEZ, MONA. YOU'RE LIKE A DOG
WITH A BONE. LET IT GO.

25:46.215 --> 25:48.217
I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE UPSET.

25:48.217 --> 25:50.219
I'D BE ON EDGE, TOO,

25:50.219 --> 25:52.221
IF MY MARRIAGE
WERE HAVING PROBLEMS.

25:52.221 --> 25:54.223
OKAY, MIKE AND I ARE
PERFECTLY HAPPY,

25:54.223 --> 25:55.554
AND THE ONLY PROBLEM WE HAVE
IS YOU.

25:55.554 --> 25:59.128
SO STAY OUT OF OUR LIVES,
OR YOU'LL BE SORRY.

25:59.128 --> 26:01.230
WELL, IF YOU TWO
ARE SO HAPPY.

26:01.230 --> 26:03.663
THEN WHERE DID HE JUST
DISAPPEAR TO?

26:03.663 --> 26:06.766
(groans) HE'S SNAKING
A LADY'S DRAIN, OKAY?

26:08.868 --> 26:11.671
AND, YES,
I REALIZE HOW THAT SOUNDED.

26:11.671 --> 26:14.173
GET YOUR MINDS
OUT OF THE GUTTER.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.188
(children laughing
and speaking indistinctly)

26:29.188 --> 26:31.320
OKAY, RACHEL, HAVE FUN.

26:31.320 --> 26:34.323
COCO THE CLOWN WILL MAKE YOU
ANY BALLOON ANIMAL YOU WANT.

26:34.323 --> 26:36.826
UH, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD
STAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

26:36.826 --> 26:38.828
OH, COME ON.
I'M WATCHING THEM.

26:38.828 --> 26:40.830
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

26:40.830 --> 26:42.872
WILL YOU BE HERE?

26:45.975 --> 26:47.206
(scoffs)

26:47.206 --> 26:50.209
COULD YOU BELIEVE HER?
I'M A GOOD MOM, AREN'T I?

26:50.209 --> 26:53.182
PEOPLE TRUST ME.
 HEY, I BROUGHT MY KID,
DIDN'T I?

26:53.182 --> 26:55.014
YES, YOU DID.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.116
BUT WAIT. YOU'RE STAYING.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.118
I'LL GET US DRINKS.

27:02.091 --> 27:05.895
HI, SWEETIE. WHAT'S THE MATTER?
AREN'T YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME?

27:05.895 --> 27:07.897
THE MAN IS PUTTING
THE MONKEY AWAY.

27:07.897 --> 27:10.259
HE SAID HE WAS TOO TIRED
TO PLAY ANYMORE.

27:10.259 --> 27:14.904
OH, I DON'T THINK SO. THAT APE
IS ON THE CLOCK TILL 4:00.

27:14.904 --> 27:17.366
HEY! WHAT GIVES?

27:17.366 --> 27:20.840
SORRY. MR. FIBBS DID TWO SHOWS
YESTERDAY. HE NEEDS A NAP.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.042
NO WAY. I PAID
FOR TWO HOURS OF MONKEY.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.044
I WANT TWO HOURS OF MONKEY.

27:25.044 --> 27:28.117
LET HIM GO.
I CAN DO THE GIG ALONE.

27:28.117 --> 27:29.418
NO OFFENSE, COCO,

27:29.418 --> 27:31.781
BUT I NEED THIS TO BE
THE GREATEST PARTY EVER,

27:31.781 --> 27:35.284
AND YOUR ACT ISN'T EXACTLY
ZINGIN' THE KIDS.
 HEY, I KILLED
AT YOUR OTHER KID'S PARTY.

27:35.284 --> 27:38.287
THOSE KIDS WERE 3! THESE ARE
7-YEAR-OLDS! THE BIG TIME!

27:38.287 --> 27:40.259
CRAPPY BALLOON ANIMALS
AIN'T GONNA CUT IT!

27:40.259 --> 27:43.062
WE NEED THE MONKEY!
 LADY, HE'S TIRED.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.364
WELL, THEN GIVE HIM SOME
BANANA-FLAVORED COFFEE.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.867
YOU SCREW ME ON THIS,
AND I SWEAR,

27:47.867 --> 27:51.200
FIBBS WILL NEVER WORK
IN THIS TOWN AGAIN.

27:57.406 --> 27:59.709
(knock on door)
 COME IN.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.252
YOU CALLED FOR A LIGHTBULB?

28:03.252 --> 28:05.454
THE BEDSIDE LAMP.

28:11.320 --> 28:14.023
I SAW YOU PULL IN
AN HOUR AGO.

28:14.023 --> 28:16.325
(lamp rattling)
 YOUR GENTLEMAN FRIEND
STAND YOU UP?

28:16.325 --> 28:19.999
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU, BUT HE
JUST CALLED. HE'S ON HIS WAY.

28:19.999 --> 28:23.272
HMM. THAT'S NICE.

28:23.272 --> 28:24.774
(click)

28:24.774 --> 28:26.776
WELL, IF YOU FINISH
YOUR MAGAZINE,

28:26.776 --> 28:28.778
THERE'S A BIBLE
IN THE NIGHTSTAND.

28:28.778 --> 28:31.310
TELL ME SOMETHING.

28:31.310 --> 28:34.313
DID HE CHEAT ON YOU JUST ONCE
OR DID HE DO IT ALL THE TIME?

28:37.847 --> 28:39.388
WHO?

28:39.388 --> 28:41.891
I'VE BEEN WONDERING
WHAT MAKES A WOMAN

28:41.891 --> 28:44.393
SO QUICK TO JUDGE ANYONE
WHO HAS AN AFFAIR,

28:44.393 --> 28:46.395
AND I THINK I KNOW.

28:46.395 --> 28:49.398
YOUR HUSBAND CHEATED ON YOU,
DIDN'T HE?

28:56.165 --> 28:57.306
(sighs)

28:59.168 --> 29:02.211
MY HUSBAND...

29:02.211 --> 29:05.945
WAS THE BEST MAN
THAT I EVER KNEW.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.917
BUT A GOOD MAN

29:07.917 --> 29:09.949
WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

29:09.949 --> 29:12.051
I WAS LIKE YOU.

29:12.051 --> 29:14.083
I WANTED FUN, EXCITEMENT,

29:14.083 --> 29:17.186
SO I FOUND MYSELF
A BOYFRIEND.

29:17.186 --> 29:19.458
GOOD-LOOKING GUY. SEXY.

29:19.458 --> 29:22.161
AND WE HAD OURSELVES
A REAL GOOD TIME.

29:22.161 --> 29:25.434
YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME,
LADY?

29:25.434 --> 29:27.136
YES, I AM.

29:29.038 --> 29:31.941
ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS.

29:31.941 --> 29:34.143
IT DIDN'T LAST LONG FOR ME.

29:34.143 --> 29:36.045
AND WHEN IT WAS DONE,

29:36.045 --> 29:39.809
I HAD NO HUSBAND
AND NO BOYFRIEND.

29:41.450 --> 29:44.083
SO NOW I'M CLEANING ROOMS.

29:44.083 --> 29:48.417
EVERY DAY, I SEE WOMEN IN HERE
ACTING JUST AS STUPID AS I WAS.

29:48.417 --> 29:50.789
I DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.022
I JUST GIVE THEM A LOOK.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.967
WELL, I'M...

29:57.967 --> 30:00.199
SORRY YOUR AFFAIR
ENDED SO BADLY.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.501
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT MINE WILL.

30:17.146 --> 30:20.389
(turns off faucet)

30:20.389 --> 30:23.923
YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE LADY.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.995
DON'T YOU EVER FEEL GUILTY?

30:25.995 --> 30:27.296
NO.

30:34.303 --> 30:36.605
YES, ALL RIGHT?

30:36.605 --> 30:39.408
YES, I FEEL GUILTY
ALL THE TIME.

30:41.310 --> 30:45.144
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
WHEN I COME HOME,

30:45.144 --> 30:48.077
AND MY HUSBAND'S AT THE DOOR

30:48.077 --> 30:52.351
AND THERE'S SUCH LOVE
IN HIS EYES, SUCH...

30:52.351 --> 30:55.554
HOPE.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.387
AND I WANNA SHAKE HIM
AND SAY, "STOP IT.

30:58.387 --> 31:03.132
STOP LOVING ME.
I'M NOT WORTH IT ANYMORE."

31:03.132 --> 31:07.396
DON'T YOU WANT
TO BE WORTH IT AGAIN?

31:10.369 --> 31:15.344
HI, HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

31:15.344 --> 31:18.007
IS THERE SOME KIND
OF PROBLEM?

31:18.007 --> 31:20.509
NO, SIR.

31:20.509 --> 31:23.212
JUST TURNING ON A LIGHT.

31:32.061 --> 31:35.264
THERE YOU ARE.

31:35.264 --> 31:38.998
NOW IT'S A KIDS' PARTY.
(laughs)
 (chuckles)

31:38.998 --> 31:41.500
ARE YOU STILL MAD
ABOUT LAURA?

31:41.500 --> 31:45.134
THE PARTY'S A SUCCESS. THE KIDS
ARE HAVING A GREAT TIME.

31:45.134 --> 31:49.078
WE'RE DRINKIN' MARGARITAS.
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKEY?

31:49.078 --> 31:51.310
(chuckles) YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.641
I WON.

31:52.641 --> 31:54.013
(clink)
 (laughs)

31:54.013 --> 31:56.015
LAURA AND HER STUCK-UP POSSE

31:56.015 --> 31:58.017
THOUGHT HER KIDS
WEREN'T SAFE IN MY HOUSE.

31:58.017 --> 32:01.050
I'VE SHOWN THEM THE BEST TIME
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE ALL YEAR.
 (children screaming)

32:01.050 --> 32:02.521
UM, GABY?

32:02.521 --> 32:05.394
I KNOW. THEY'RE LOUD.
KIDS! ADULTS TALKING!

32:05.394 --> 32:08.557
NO, I THINK
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM.

32:08.557 --> 32:11.700
M.J.? M.J., WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
 THE MONKEY'S KILLING THE CLOWN!

32:11.700 --> 32:15.004
(screaming continues)

32:16.465 --> 32:18.267
(monkey screeching)

32:18.267 --> 32:21.570
(gasps)
 I'VE GOTTA GET
MY TRANQUILIZER GUN.

32:21.570 --> 32:23.572
I TOLD YOU HE NEEDED A NAP!

32:23.572 --> 32:25.574
HE WAS ALREADY ON EDGE,

32:25.574 --> 32:28.577
AND THEN THAT DAMN CLOWN
POPPED A BALLOON IN HIS FACE!

32:28.577 --> 32:29.578
(groaning)

32:29.578 --> 32:30.649
(gasps)

32:30.649 --> 32:33.652
(grunting)

32:35.424 --> 32:37.286
OH!

32:37.286 --> 32:40.389
(screeches)

32:40.389 --> 32:43.092
LAURA,
I WAS HERE EVERY MINUTE!

32:43.092 --> 32:46.235
IT'S NOT MY FAULT THEY SENT US
A HOMICIDAL MONKEY!

32:46.235 --> 32:48.537
W--AND THE IMPORTANT PART
IS THE KIDS HAD A GOOD TIME

32:48.537 --> 32:50.399
AND CREATED
LIFELONG MEMORIES.

32:50.399 --> 32:51.700
(Coco groans)

32:57.176 --> 33:00.409
HEY, YOU FORGOT
YOUR GOODY BAG!

33:00.409 --> 33:01.750
(sighs)

33:10.219 --> 33:12.561
SO I STILL DON'T GET
WHY YOU FIRED ROY.

33:12.561 --> 33:14.563
I MEAN, HE WAS
PUTTING THE BIRDHOUSE

33:14.563 --> 33:16.565
WHERE YOU WANTED IT, RIGHT?

33:16.565 --> 33:19.498
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
HE SAID I EMASCULATE YOU.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.000
HE SAID THAT?
 WELL, NOT IN THOSE WORDS.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.204
HE WENT WITH A MORE COLORFUL
NUTCRACKING ANALOGY.

33:25.204 --> 33:28.377
(laughs) HE IS FUNNY.
 HE IS NOT FUNNY!

33:28.377 --> 33:30.379
AND THIS WOULD BE
A REALLY GOOD PLACE

33:30.379 --> 33:33.382
FOR YOU TO JUMP IN AND TELL ME
I'M NOT A CASTRATING BITCH.

33:33.382 --> 33:36.445
SURE. JUST PUT DOWN
THE KNIFE FIRST.

33:36.445 --> 33:39.388
WOW. WE ARE NOT LAUGHING
AT THIS AT ALL, HUH?

33:39.388 --> 33:41.320
NO!
 OH, COME ON, BABE.

33:41.320 --> 33:45.554
WE'RE GREAT. YOU KNOW THAT.
WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT HE THINKS?

33:45.554 --> 33:49.258
I DON'T CARE. IT'S JUST--
IT BUGS ME THAT HE'S JUDGING ME.

33:51.230 --> 33:54.803
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT?
 I THOUGHT I'D BARBECUE
SOME CHICKEN.

33:54.803 --> 33:58.307
MM. IT'S ALMOST DINNERTIME,
AND THAT'S STILL FROZEN.

33:58.307 --> 34:01.310
JUST GET SOME BURGERS
FROM THE GARAGE.

34:01.310 --> 34:02.711
YOU GOT IT.

34:16.324 --> 34:19.388
HEY, ROY.
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

34:19.388 --> 34:22.690
SURE THING, PALLY.
HERE. TAKE A LOAD OFF.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.693
(both chuckle)

34:24.693 --> 34:27.696
IF IT'S ABOUT ME GETTING INTO IT
WITH YOUR WIFE, THOUGH,

34:27.696 --> 34:31.500
I HAVE TO STOP YOU FIRST
AND SAY I'M SORRY.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.442
WELL, THANKS.

34:33.442 --> 34:35.444
I MEAN, I KNOW
TIMES HAVE CHANGED,

34:35.444 --> 34:37.476
BUT A MAN'S STILL A MAN,

34:37.476 --> 34:40.349
AND YOU DESERVE
TO HAVE YOUR WIFE RESPECT YOU.

34:40.349 --> 34:42.451
SHE RESPECTS ME PLENTY,
ROY.

34:42.451 --> 34:43.752
MM.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.157
HERE'S THE THING

34:48.157 --> 34:51.089
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND
ABOUT LYNETTE.

34:52.721 --> 34:55.724
SHE GREW UP WITHOUT HER DAD.
HER MOM WAS A DRINKER.

34:55.724 --> 34:59.097
SO SHE HAD TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR EVERYONE.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.629
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S ROUGH.

35:00.629 --> 35:02.171
YEAH.

35:02.171 --> 35:06.235
IT LEFT HER
WITH THIS CONSTANT FEAR

35:06.235 --> 35:10.239
THAT EVERYTHING
COULD SUDDENLY FALL APART.

35:10.239 --> 35:13.812
AND THAT'S WHY SHE NEEDS
TO CONTROL EVERYTHING.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.515
OF COURSE, SHE CAN'T.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.517
NOBODY CAN.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.789
BUT...

35:20.789 --> 35:24.723
SHE CAN CONTROL ME...

35:24.723 --> 35:26.655
IF I LET HER.

35:26.655 --> 35:31.430
SO I DO...

35:31.430 --> 35:36.635
BECAUSE IT MAKES HER
FEEL SAFE.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.807
AND THAT IS MY JOB

35:38.807 --> 35:40.469
AS HER HUSBAND...

35:40.469 --> 35:42.571
(opens beer can)

35:42.571 --> 35:44.573
TO MAKE HER FEEL SAFE.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.752
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, SCAVO.

35:56.225 --> 35:57.686
I TRY.

35:57.686 --> 36:00.559
NOW...
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

36:00.559 --> 36:03.432
I HAVE HAMBURGER TO FETCH.

36:03.432 --> 36:05.434
(chuckles)

36:10.239 --> 36:11.570
MMM. (kisses)

36:11.570 --> 36:15.274
STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP.
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

36:15.274 --> 36:17.406
CARLOS, A MONKEY
ALMOST KILLED A CLOWN.

36:17.406 --> 36:20.349
THAT IS THE DEFINITION
OF A BAD CHILDREN'S PARTY.

36:20.349 --> 36:21.650
(laughs)

36:21.650 --> 36:24.513
(groans) MAN.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.487
LAURA'S RIGHT.
I'M A TERRIBLE MOM.

36:28.487 --> 36:31.960
HEY. COME HERE.

36:31.960 --> 36:34.863
LOOK... (sighs)

36:34.863 --> 36:38.567
I AM NO EXPERT
AT RAISING CHILDREN.

36:38.567 --> 36:40.429
ALL I KNOW IS,

36:40.429 --> 36:43.702
WHEN ALL THOSE OTHER KIDS
RAN SCREAMING TO THEIR MOMS,

36:43.702 --> 36:45.704
JUANITA JUMPED
IN THE BOUNCY HOUSE

36:45.704 --> 36:48.407
AND ZIPPED IT UP,
AND CELIA PLAYED DEAD.

36:48.407 --> 36:49.708
THOSE GIRLS ARE SMART.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.711
(chuckles) YEAH. THEY WERE QUICK
ON THEIR FEET, WEREN'T THEY?

36:52.711 --> 36:54.413
WHICH THEY WOULDN'T BE

36:54.413 --> 36:57.246
IF YOU'D BEEN HOVERING
ALL OVER 'EM THEIR WHOLE LIVES.

36:57.246 --> 36:59.548
THEY HAVE LEARNED TO BE
INDEPENDENT AND RESOURCEFUL,

36:59.548 --> 37:02.391
AND THAT IS THANKS
TO YOUR NEGLIGENCE.

37:02.391 --> 37:04.593
MMM. SO SWEET.

37:04.593 --> 37:05.724
(chuckles)

37:05.724 --> 37:07.596
(loud thumping)
 (girl) OW!

37:07.596 --> 37:10.459
THAT BETTER NOT BE
THE GOOD SUITCASE!

37:12.961 --> 37:14.563
(Julie) MOM!

37:14.563 --> 37:15.904
JULIE?

37:15.904 --> 37:17.266
JULIE?!

37:18.507 --> 37:20.439
SWEETIE?

37:20.439 --> 37:21.810
GET MIKE!

37:21.810 --> 37:24.543
HE'S ON A JOB.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 SOMEBODY IS OUTSIDE.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.475
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IS THAT?!

37:26.475 --> 37:29.518
IT'S A GUN.
 WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?!

37:29.518 --> 37:32.581
GIVE THAT TO ME.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

37:32.581 --> 37:34.523
(gasps)

37:34.523 --> 37:35.984
IT'S LOADED, RIGHT?

37:43.862 --> 37:45.764
I HAVE A GUN!

37:45.764 --> 37:48.937
I'VE CALLED THE POLICE!
THEY'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE!

37:55.874 --> 37:57.376
(rustling)

37:57.376 --> 37:58.807
(gasps)

37:58.807 --> 38:00.579
(gasps)
 (thud)

38:02.311 --> 38:05.914
(dogs barking in distance)

38:05.914 --> 38:07.456
KATHERINE?

38:07.456 --> 38:09.618
(gasps) YOU SHOT ME!

38:09.618 --> 38:11.059
(gasps)

38:19.498 --> 38:21.830
OH, MY GOD! KATHERINE,
THE GUN JUST WENT OFF!

38:21.830 --> 38:24.603
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
 YOU TRIED TO KILL ME!

38:24.603 --> 38:28.637
OKAY, I JUST SHOT YOU. LET'S NOT
BE THROWING ACCUSATIONS AROUND.
 IT LOOKS LIKE
IT JUST GRAZED YOUR SHOULDER.

38:28.637 --> 38:30.339
THERE'S HARDLY ANY BLOOD.

38:30.339 --> 38:33.512
WHAT HAPPENED?
 SUSAN SHOT ME! CALL THE POLICE!

38:33.512 --> 38:37.315
I TOLD YOU SHE WAS GONNA SNAP.
IT'S ALWAYS THE PRETTY ONES.
 IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.749
BOB, I WANT YOU TO BE MY LAWYER.
 NO, NO, I CALL BOB
AS MY LAWYER.

38:40.749 --> 38:43.522
WE HEARD A GUN GO OFF. (gasps)

38:43.522 --> 38:46.324
SUSAN SHOT ME!
 (gasps) SUSAN!

38:46.324 --> 38:49.898
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS HER.

38:49.898 --> 38:53.432
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
SNEAKING AROUND MY HOUSE?
 I WAS ON NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH!

38:53.432 --> 38:57.606
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
AN ASSIGNED SHIFT.
 TOM SCAVO HAD TO STUDY.
HE ASKED ME TO FILL IN!

38:57.606 --> 39:00.609
WELL... YOU SHOULD'VE
CHECKED WITH ME.

39:00.609 --> 39:02.541
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO
WHEN YOU SHOT ME!

39:02.541 --> 39:05.744
OW!
 ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY, JUST CALM DOWN.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.377
I'M GONNA GO CALL
AN AMBULANCE.

39:08.377 --> 39:12.421
PERHAPS WE SHOULD UNLOAD THIS
BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE GETS HURT.

39:12.421 --> 39:14.423
BREE, DEAR?

39:22.461 --> 39:24.693
SUSAN JUST SHOT
KATHERINE MAYFAIR.

39:24.693 --> 39:25.834
WHAT?

39:25.834 --> 39:28.897
SHE'S OKAY,
BUT SHE'S--SHE'S FREAKED OUT.

39:28.897 --> 39:31.700
(dialing telephone)
 HUH. I NEVER PEGGED SUSAN
AS A GUN OWNER.

39:31.700 --> 39:34.473
OH, CRAP.
 (beep)

39:34.473 --> 39:37.576
IT'S OUR GUN.
I GAVE IT TO JULIE.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.608
WHAT? WHY?

39:39.608 --> 39:41.810
SHE WAS SACRED.
SHE WANTED PROTECTION.

39:41.810 --> 39:43.952
THAT GUN IS UNDER
OUR REAL NAME!

39:43.952 --> 39:45.954
IF THEY TRACE THAT BACK
TO US--

39:45.954 --> 39:49.918
WELL, WE ARE NOT GOING
TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

39:49.918 --> 39:52.390
YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL FOR THIS.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.523
EVERYONE HEARD YOU YOU--AAH!
THREATEN ME AT THAT MEETING.

39:54.523 --> 39:56.565
I HAVE WITNESSES.

39:56.565 --> 39:58.567
OH, PLEASE.
 IF I WERE GONNA KILL YOU,

39:58.567 --> 40:00.569
I WOULDN'T DO IT
IN MY OWN FRONT YARD.

40:00.569 --> 40:03.502
I'D SNEAK INTO YOUR HOUSE
AND SHOOT YOU

40:03.502 --> 40:06.435
WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP.

40:06.435 --> 40:08.607
NOT THAT I WOULD EVER
DO THAT.

40:08.607 --> 40:09.538
(sighs)

40:09.538 --> 40:11.740
KATHERINE,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

40:11.740 --> 40:14.483
HOME, TO CALL THE POLICE.

40:14.483 --> 40:15.484
(groans)

40:17.886 --> 40:21.189
HEY, KATHERINE,
THE AMBULANCE IS ON ITS WAY.

40:21.189 --> 40:23.692
BUT I BROUGHT
A FIRST AID KIT.

40:23.692 --> 40:27.596
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME CLEAN
YOU UP, AND THEN YOU CAN CALL?

40:27.596 --> 40:29.628
OW! OW! (inhales sharply)

40:29.628 --> 40:31.500
JUST LEAVE IT!

40:31.500 --> 40:33.902
HAND ME THE PHONE.
I WANNA CALL THE POLICE.
 UH...

40:33.902 --> 40:37.035
MM. DUMB MOVE, KATHERINE.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.067
WHAT?

40:39.067 --> 40:41.640
(sighs) LISTEN TO ME.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.773
YOU AND MIKE...
I SEE IT, TOO.

40:46.575 --> 40:49.177
THOSE LOOKS HE GIVES YOU?

40:49.177 --> 40:51.950
HE'S STILL CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.122
I KNOW!

40:54.122 --> 40:57.125
SO... USE YOUR HEAD.
YOU WANNA CALL THE POLICE

40:57.125 --> 41:00.128
AND HAVE THE MOTHER OF HIS KID
CARTED OFF TO JAIL?

41:00.128 --> 41:02.791
DON'T BE STUPID.
HIGH ROAD ALL THE WAY.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.065
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

41:07.065 --> 41:09.698
MM-HMM, AND BESIDES,
YOU WALK AROUND

41:09.698 --> 41:12.641
WITH A BANDAGE ON YOUR SHOULDER
FOR A FEW DAYS--

41:12.641 --> 41:15.103
SHE LOOKS LIKE A MONSTER,

41:15.103 --> 41:17.846
AND YOU COME OFF
LOOKING LIKE A SAINT.

41:17.846 --> 41:19.548
(door opens)

41:21.179 --> 41:23.712
SO HOW WE DOIN' HERE?

41:23.712 --> 41:26.655
(singsongy) I'M FINE!

41:28.687 --> 41:30.589
YEAH.

41:30.589 --> 41:34.623
I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE NEEDING
THAT AMBULANCE ANYMORE. HMM?

41:34.623 --> 41:38.627
(Lee) I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU
COULD REALLY SEE HER EYES...

41:38.627 --> 41:42.200
(sighs) SO AM I GOING TO JAIL?
 NAH.
SHE'S NOT CALLING ANYBODY.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.703
SHE'S A LITTLE WORKED UP,
BUT WE TALKED.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.775
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

41:46.775 --> 41:48.637
OKAY, THEN.

41:53.742 --> 41:57.816
IT IS IN OUR NATURE
TO JUDGE THE PEOPLE AROUND US.

41:57.816 --> 42:01.119
IF THEY IGNORE OUR WISHES,

42:01.119 --> 42:04.623
WE BELIEVE
THEY ARE DISRESPECTFUL.

42:04.623 --> 42:08.757
IF THEY DON'T WATCH
THEIR CHILDREN,

42:08.757 --> 42:12.861
WE CONCLUDE
THEY ARE UNFIT PARENTS.

42:12.861 --> 42:14.302
(door closes)

42:14.302 --> 42:17.666
IF WE CATCH THEM CHEATING,

42:17.666 --> 42:20.709
WE ASSUME
WE KNOW THEIR REASONS.

42:20.709 --> 42:24.673
BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
WE FINALLY STOP FOR A MOMENT

42:24.673 --> 42:27.145
TO JUDGE OUR OWN LIVES?

42:29.578 --> 42:31.079
IT CAN BE PAINFUL

42:31.079 --> 42:35.654
TO STEP BACK AND SEE
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING...

42:37.726 --> 42:42.030
AND EVEN MORE PAINFUL
TO REALIZE

42:42.030 --> 42:44.933
WE HAVE NO INTENTION

42:44.933 --> 42:47.666
OF STOPPING.
