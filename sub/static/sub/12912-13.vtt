00:44.900 --> 00:48.460

01:44.660 --> 01:45.740
Are you busy tonight?

01:45.820 --> 01:47.300
Depends what you have in mind.

01:47.380 --> 01:49.500
It's very romantic.
-I like the sound of that.

01:49.580 --> 01:51.220
You, me...
-Yes?

01:51.300 --> 01:53.180
...a handful of customers.
-I'm not working late again.

01:53.260 --> 01:56.380
I'll make it up to you.
-That's what you said on Friday

01:56.460 --> 01:58.020
when I filled in for Tanya.
-She had a date.

01:58.100 --> 02:01.580
Seems like everyone who works here
gets to have a life, except me.

02:01.660 --> 02:03.580
I'll doubly make it up to you.

02:05.980 --> 02:07.020
Is that a yes?

02:07.620 --> 02:10.300
You're management. I'm staff.
What choice do I have?

02:10.380 --> 02:13.300
Thanks.
-You're just lucky I like you so much.

02:16.380 --> 02:18.340
Was it someone from the pod?

02:18.420 --> 02:21.140
Uh, I don't think so.

02:21.220 --> 02:23.140
No.
-And then she vanished?

02:23.220 --> 02:24.700
You mean she cloaked.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.740
I'm... not sure.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.420
Are you sure you
didn't imagine it?

02:35.940 --> 02:37.700
Hey, are you okay?

02:37.780 --> 02:39.300
I'm fine.

02:39.380 --> 02:41.220
Then who was that mermaid?

02:41.300 --> 02:44.620
See? Zac saw it, too.

02:44.700 --> 02:48.820
I don't know who it was, but it
was like she was calling to me.

02:53.780 --> 02:54.860
Hi, guys.

02:55.940 --> 02:57.740
Hey.
-Hey.

02:58.420 --> 03:00.940
I've just been called in
for an emergency shift at work,

03:01.020 --> 03:03.540
so we're gonna have
to cancel our movie.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.740
That's okay. I'll walk with you.

03:08.220 --> 03:09.860
Bye.
-Bye.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.500
Do you guys think Mimmi's okay?

03:15.620 --> 03:18.220
If she was any happier,
she'd be floating.

03:21.820 --> 03:25.700
Hey. What are you doing this weekend?
-Going out with my boyfriend.

03:25.780 --> 03:28.420
He's a lucky fellow.
-Yeah, he is.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.500
So what are we doing?

03:30.300 --> 03:32.460
I beg your pardon?
-You said we were going out.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.740
No, I said I was going out
with my boyfriend.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.580
What?
-See, that's the problem.

03:39.660 --> 03:42.060
I don't know which one of you
I'm talking to anymore.

03:42.140 --> 03:44.940
My boyfriend or my boss.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.660
Well, I do wear both hats.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.180
How am I supposed to know
which hat you're wearing?

03:55.740 --> 03:57.540
I'm really sorry
I missed our day.

03:58.540 --> 04:00.740
That's okay.
We can do something tomorrow.

04:00.820 --> 04:03.300
Actually, I'm playing
football tomorrow morning.

04:03.380 --> 04:05.740
Why don't you come and watch,
and we can go out after?

04:05.820 --> 04:08.060
Football?
-Uh, yeah.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.820
I'm playing at Suncoast High.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.540
And bring anyone you'd like. We
need all the support we can get.

04:13.620 --> 04:14.700
Okay.

04:18.660 --> 04:21.260
Ooh.
-How were the dolphins?

04:21.339 --> 04:24.020
More to the point,
how was dolphin boy?

04:24.100 --> 04:25.420
Ondina!

04:25.500 --> 04:26.700
Chris is fine.

04:26.780 --> 04:29.340
He's playing football tomorrow.
Will you come and watch?

04:29.420 --> 04:31.940
Football?
-It's a land people game.

04:32.020 --> 04:34.740
They run after a ball
and kick it into a net.

04:34.820 --> 04:36.900
It's very popular.
-Ugh. Thanks, I'll pass.

04:36.980 --> 04:38.140
Please come.

04:38.220 --> 04:40.380
Chris said that his team
needs the support.

04:40.460 --> 04:41.500
It'll be fun.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.060
When was the last time
you did anything for fun?

04:45.940 --> 04:47.100
I have fun.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.220
When?

05:10.300 --> 05:12.060
Being a boss is really hard.

05:19.900 --> 05:20.980
Mimmi?

05:21.900 --> 05:24.220
What are you doing?
-She's here.

05:26.340 --> 05:27.580
Who's here?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.100
The mermaid.

05:30.220 --> 05:31.900
There's nothing there.

05:31.980 --> 05:33.820
Mimmi, what's going on?

05:34.860 --> 05:36.980
You can see her, can't you?

06:00.100 --> 06:01.180
She's gone.

06:08.740 --> 06:11.220
This...
this is getting seriously weird.

06:11.900 --> 06:15.500
You know, when she smiled,
it was so familiar.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.780
I felt like I knew her.

06:17.860 --> 06:20.660
Do you have any idea who she is?

06:22.900 --> 06:24.620
I think she's our mother.

06:30.220 --> 06:33.020
Mimmi, it's not possible.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.860
Why not?

06:34.940 --> 06:37.700
When I saw her smile,
something clicked.

06:37.780 --> 06:40.580
I remember seeing
her look down at me.

06:40.660 --> 06:43.340
I remember feeling... loved.

06:44.380 --> 06:46.100
You didn't see her?

06:47.580 --> 06:48.780
I didn't either.

06:49.620 --> 06:52.140
I am sure that it was Nerissa.

06:52.220 --> 06:53.820
Nerissa's your mother?

06:55.020 --> 06:56.420
The Nerissa?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.820
She left us when
we were very young.

06:58.900 --> 07:03.260
A rebel mermaid called Aurora
threatened the Northern Pod.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.900
Nerissa wanted her
children to be safe.

07:05.980 --> 07:07.460
I can't believe it.

07:07.540 --> 07:10.260
Nerissa was like
a rock star to us.

07:10.340 --> 07:11.900
What do you know about her?

07:11.980 --> 07:16.100
When Aurora turned on the Eastern
Pod, Nerissa came to our rescue.

07:16.180 --> 07:19.340
She fought alongside us for years.
-Did you see her?

07:19.420 --> 07:21.100
Mmm, once.

07:21.180 --> 07:24.860
My grandmother was on the mermaid
council and she introduced us.

07:24.940 --> 07:28.540
Nerissa was awesome.
Brave and powerful.

07:29.940 --> 07:31.340
And so beautiful.

07:31.420 --> 07:33.060
What happened to her?

07:34.180 --> 07:37.180
It's... not really clear.

07:37.260 --> 07:39.180
Please... Weilan.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.860
I need to know.

07:45.180 --> 07:47.500
One day,
she went off to face Aurora.

07:50.180 --> 07:52.180
No one ever saw her again.

07:52.260 --> 07:56.060
So, there is a chance
she could still be alive?

07:56.140 --> 08:02.220
Mimmi, I'm sure that if Nerissa had
been able to come for you and Zac...

08:02.300 --> 08:03.380
she would have.

08:14.380 --> 08:17.780
You saw what I saw.
-But I didn't see anything in the water.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.700
That doesn't mean
she wasn't there.

08:19.780 --> 08:23.420
But Weilan said...
-I don't care what Weilan said!

08:25.500 --> 08:29.500
Mimmi, we don't know
how these visions work.

08:29.580 --> 08:33.780
Maybe you wanted to see Nerissa so
badly that you made me see her, too.

08:36.100 --> 08:40.059
So... you're saying this is all
just wish fulfillment?

08:41.659 --> 08:45.020
What I'm saying is that we
don't know what this is...

08:46.060 --> 08:49.020
and until we do, we shouldn't be
jumping to any conclusions.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.500
Are we going to a baseball game?

09:09.580 --> 09:12.340
When you are wearing the
black hat, you're the boss.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.420
The white hat means
you're my boyfriend.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.140
Interesting color choice.

09:16.220 --> 09:19.380
You've got boss-Cam as the bad
guy and boyfriend-Cam as the hero.

09:19.460 --> 09:23.180
I was just trying to make it
clear, as in black and white.

09:23.260 --> 09:26.220
But I can switch them.
-Let's not add to the confusion.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.420
That's the beauty of this.
There won't be any confusion.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.860
I'll always know
which Cam I'm getting.

09:35.940 --> 09:39.020
Excellent work, Carly. Full marks
for staff-management relations.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.060
As long as you wear the boyfriend
hat more than the other one.

10:00.940 --> 10:02.900
Please tell me we don't
have to dress like that.

10:02.980 --> 10:04.700
They look like a
school of clown fish.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.380
They look like Tiger supporters.

10:08.820 --> 10:10.100
Hi, guys.

10:10.980 --> 10:12.620
Great you could come.

10:13.340 --> 10:15.540
Hey.
-Hey.

10:15.620 --> 10:18.220
Well,
thanks for bringing everyone.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.500
Wish me luck?
-Good luck.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.180
Now what do we do?

10:29.980 --> 10:31.740
Wait for the game to start
and then you shout,

10:31.820 --> 10:34.780
"Come on, Tigers!"
or "Go, Tigers!"

10:34.860 --> 10:38.220
Especially when Chris' team
kicks the ball into the net.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.420
How do you know
what net that is?

10:40.500 --> 10:42.100
The other team's goalie
stands in front of it.

10:42.180 --> 10:43.580
Goalie?

10:43.660 --> 10:45.740
Just shout "Go, Tigers." A lot.

10:49.940 --> 10:53.340
Go, Tigers!
Go, Tigers! Go, Tigers!

10:55.180 --> 10:56.980
They haven't started yet.

11:00.540 --> 11:02.780
Go, Tigers! Go, Tigers!

11:08.540 --> 11:10.060
Go, go, go!

11:11.620 --> 11:13.780
Come on! Come on!
- Go, Tigers!

11:13.860 --> 11:15.940
Whoo-hoo! Come on, Tigers! Yes!

11:17.660 --> 11:18.740
Yes!

11:20.340 --> 11:22.020
Whoo-hoo!

11:22.100 --> 11:23.540
Go, Tigers!

11:24.500 --> 11:26.860
What?
-The other team scored.

11:26.940 --> 11:28.340
The Tigers are losing now.

11:29.340 --> 11:32.140
Oh. We can help that.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.100
One little twitch
and the ball goes in the net.

11:34.180 --> 11:36.380
That would be cheating.

11:36.460 --> 11:39.180
Land people like to play games.
Let them have their fun.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.140
Whoo! Come on, Tigers!

11:43.620 --> 11:45.180
Go, go, go! Here we go, Tigers!

11:45.260 --> 11:47.180
Tigers, Tigers, Tigers...

11:48.420 --> 11:49.620
Mimmi?

11:50.940 --> 11:52.740
Don't worry. I'm fine.

12:00.180 --> 12:02.620
Come on, Tigers, let's go!

12:09.740 --> 12:12.300
There's a guy over there complaining
there's gum under his table.

12:12.380 --> 12:15.460
Ugh. Yeah, I've looked
under those tables. It's gross.

12:16.180 --> 12:17.820
People have no manners.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.140
We really should clean them.

12:19.220 --> 12:20.860
Now?
-No, no, of course not.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.060
We'll do it after we close.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.260
Just the two of us.
It'll be fun.

12:27.540 --> 12:31.540
So you're asking me to do this because
you want to spend time with me?

12:31.620 --> 12:32.660
Absolutely.

12:34.340 --> 12:37.820
Of course, it is part of your
job, too... until we finish.

12:38.980 --> 12:40.820
Then it's just you and me, baby.

12:44.940 --> 12:48.620
I... I thought you said you wanted
me to wear the white hat more.

12:50.380 --> 12:51.620
Let's go! Whoo!

12:51.700 --> 12:52.820
Go!

12:54.340 --> 12:56.620
Go, Tigers!
-Go, Tigers!

12:58.140 --> 12:59.460
Go, Chris!

12:59.540 --> 13:01.940
Here!
- Go!

13:06.620 --> 13:08.020
Yeah!

13:08.100 --> 13:09.660
He did that just like a dolphin!

13:09.740 --> 13:12.020
You can teach land
people anything.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.300
Go, Tigers!

13:22.380 --> 13:23.580
Who are you supposed to be now?

13:23.660 --> 13:27.020
I've realized something.
I'm not just a great manager.

13:27.780 --> 13:29.820
I'm not just your boyfriend.
I'm both.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.580
So, to avoid confusion...

13:36.380 --> 13:37.580
What do you think?

13:38.700 --> 13:39.740
Seriously?

13:40.980 --> 13:42.820
I think this isn't working.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.460
<i>Tigers, Tigers, you're the best.</i>

13:50.540 --> 13:53.300
Might as well forget the rest.
Tigers, Tigers, all the way.

13:53.380 --> 13:54.700
Up on top and there to stay!

13:54.780 --> 13:56.260
Go, Tigers!
-Whoo!

13:56.340 --> 13:58.540
Kick it. Go, Tigers!

13:58.620 --> 13:59.780
Whoo!

14:06.860 --> 14:08.700
It's happening again.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.260
She's calling to me. Come on.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.820
What about Chris?
What about the game?

14:15.900 --> 14:19.140
Our mother is out there
waiting for me. For us.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.420
I know you want our mother back.
I do, too.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.740
But this isn't real.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.540
We shared visions
twice yesterday.

14:25.620 --> 14:27.340
You can't tell me
that that's not real.

14:27.420 --> 14:28.780
My moon ring glowed again.

14:28.860 --> 14:30.940
I think she's using it
to make a connection with me.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.620
I'm going out there
to try the same thing.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.180
No, Mimmi.
You need to let it go.

14:35.820 --> 14:37.060
Let her go.

14:38.380 --> 14:42.980
It's all right for you.
You have a mother and a father.

14:43.060 --> 14:44.660
I've never had anyone.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.420
You've got me.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.060
Are you coming or not?

14:52.100 --> 14:53.380
I'm sorry.

15:03.900 --> 15:04.900
We won! We won! Whoo!

15:04.980 --> 15:06.940
Come on, boys!

15:10.660 --> 15:11.940
Good game, Chris.

15:13.700 --> 15:14.740
Where's Mimmi?

15:14.820 --> 15:17.300
Uh, she had to go.
- Is she coming back?

15:17.380 --> 15:19.020
We're supposed to be
going out after the game.

15:19.100 --> 15:22.140
She said she'd catch up with you
later. She'll be happy you won.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.620
Well, why didn't she stay?

15:36.340 --> 15:37.620
What happened?

15:40.220 --> 15:41.820
We had a bit of an argument.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.660
Mimmi wants so badly to believe
our mother's alive.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.900
Can you blame her?
-Why did she take off?

15:47.740 --> 15:50.180
She thinks she can reach Nerissa
by using her moon ring.

15:50.260 --> 15:52.780
No. She can't!
-Try telling her that.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.900
Moon rings contain the
power of moonlight.

15:54.980 --> 15:56.740
If she uses it,
she could summon the dragon.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.500
We can cut through
here to the beach!

16:37.420 --> 16:39.900
Zac?
- Zac, what is it?

16:53.740 --> 16:55.940
The dragon's chasing Mimmi!
-Where is she?

16:56.780 --> 16:58.140
Heading for land!

17:13.700 --> 17:14.819
Which way?

17:17.099 --> 17:18.579
I don't know.

17:31.980 --> 17:34.140
She's in the canal, near Evie's.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.180
That's a dead end!

18:53.340 --> 18:56.060
It's okay, sis. You're safe now.

19:04.740 --> 19:07.380
How did you get
the dragon to back off?

19:07.460 --> 19:08.700
I didn't.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.860
It just went away.

19:11.940 --> 19:14.300
It could have taken your tail.

19:14.380 --> 19:16.620
Why didn't it?
-I don't know.

19:17.660 --> 19:19.660
You took a huge risk today.

19:22.260 --> 19:25.140
I just wanted to see my mother.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.220
I miss her so much.

19:34.220 --> 19:37.860
Next time you decide to do something
really dumb and dangerous...

19:39.260 --> 19:41.060
will you tell me?

19:45.460 --> 19:46.740
Same.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.780
I love doing dumb,
dangerous stuff.

19:53.580 --> 19:55.300
You're right, Zac.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.140
I need to let her go.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.580
Cam.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.220
I have something to tell you.
-Wait.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.820
Before you say anything,
I have something to tell you.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.020
Me first.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.100
I quit.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.660
You quit?
-You heard.

21:06.380 --> 21:08.060
Well, I'm sorry,
I can't accept that.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.140
Why not?
-I can't accept your resignation

21:11.220 --> 21:12.540
because I don't
have the authority.

21:12.620 --> 21:13.940
But you're the manager.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.700
Not anymore. I quit.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.780
You can't. You own the place.

21:18.860 --> 21:21.300
Half the place, which...

21:21.380 --> 21:23.260
I just sold to David.

21:23.340 --> 21:26.140
So from now on, you're only
speaking with your boyfriend.

21:27.300 --> 21:29.300
You know,
I always preferred him.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.460
You big goof.

21:56.260 --> 21:59.500
I'm sorry that I ran out on you
at the football match.

21:59.580 --> 22:03.420
I had some...
family stuff to deal with.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.860
Yeah,
everybody has family stuff.

22:08.020 --> 22:11.380
Why didn't you just tell me?
-I've never had a boyfriend before.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.740
I'm trying to figure
it out as I go.

22:15.740 --> 22:18.100
I'm no expert either.

22:18.180 --> 22:20.860
But it won't work unless
we're honest with each other.

22:23.580 --> 22:26.540
Mimmi,
I need to know straight up...

22:27.300 --> 22:30.580
are you in
or out of this relationship?

22:33.980 --> 22:35.300
I'm in.

22:54.420 --> 22:56.060
<i>* In this world *</i>

22:56.140 --> 22:57.540
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

22:57.620 --> 23:00.940
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

23:01.020 --> 23:02.780
<i>* We'll make this right *</i>

23:02.860 --> 23:08.020
<i>* Find our way</i>
<i>Through this mystery *</i>

23:08.100 --> 23:09.420
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:09.500 --> 23:10.980
<i>* Swimming in the sea *</i>

23:11.060 --> 23:12.420
<i>* Now it's just you and me *</i>

23:12.500 --> 23:14.620
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:14.700 --> 23:16.180
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:16.260 --> 23:17.780
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:17.860 --> 23:19.300
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

23:19.380 --> 23:21.500
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:21.580 --> 23:23.180
<i>* Ooh ooh *</i>

23:23.260 --> 23:26.060

23:26.140 --> 23:28.140

23:28.220 --> 23:29.740

23:29.820 --> 23:32.620
<i>* Ooh ooh ooh *</i>

23:32.700 --> 23:34.260

23:35.940 --> 23:37.460

23:37.540 --> 23:39.060

23:39.140 --> 23:41.340
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:41.420 --> 23:42.620
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:42.700 --> 23:44.300
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:44.380 --> 23:45.860
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

23:45.940 --> 23:47.900
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:47.980 --> 23:49.660
<i>* Together *</i>

23:49.740 --> 23:51.260
<i>* Forever *</i>

23:51.340 --> 23:54.660
<i>* Together lying
in the sun *</i>

23:54.740 --> 23:56.220
<i>* Together *</i>

23:56.300 --> 23:57.900
<i>* Forever *</i>

23:57.980 --> 23:59.180
<i>* Together *</i>

23:59.260 --> 24:02.700

24:04.260 --> 24:07.060
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>
