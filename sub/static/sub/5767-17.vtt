WEBVTT

00:06.270 --> 00:09.501
ANNOUNCER:
And that's just the beginning.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.508
At Harold Equity,

00:11.540 --> 00:15.772
wefve seen a 31% rise
In biotechnology.

00:15.810 --> 00:20.577
And a 52% rise
in holographic imaging.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.043
Thank you, stock holders,
for helping

00:23.090 --> 00:25.650
Harold Equity
look to the future.

00:25.690 --> 00:27.351
Now let's give a big hand to

00:27.390 --> 00:28.652
the board of directors
of Harold Equity.

00:28.690 --> 00:30.783
ELI:
This isn't about morals.
It's about money.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.752
He'll try to make it
about your backstory.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.222
He needs to go there
because he can't

00:34.260 --> 00:35.522
stand on his record
as a CEO.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.367
The bastard.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.288
But you stay calm.
Keep your voice low.

00:38.330 --> 00:41.163
He gets you to raise your voice,
or lose your cool, he wins.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.668
And if he asks me
about killing my wife?

00:43.710 --> 00:45.803
Well, there's no "if."
He will ask you.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.809
That's his only play...
I was asking my
legalconsukant

00:48.840 --> 00:50.273
Mrs. Florrick?

00:50.310 --> 00:52.778
Say you didn't.
It's the truth, isn't it?

00:52.820 --> 00:55.141
It is.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.010
Thank you.

00:56.050 --> 00:58.143
You're trying
to take back the company

00:58.190 --> 00:59.350
that was stolen from you.

00:59.390 --> 01:01.255
This is about the
30% decline

01:01.290 --> 01:03.781
in stock price since
Gerald Drescher took over.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.422
_ And the vote
IS gonng my way?

01:05.460 --> 01:07.291
We swung Brynford Mutual
your way this morning.

01:07.330 --> 01:09.298
36,000 shares.
Good.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.695
And your firm will have a

01:10.730 --> 01:12.766
five percent stake,
Mrs. Florrick.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.735
That must look good for you,
making so much money.

01:15.770 --> 01:18.807
Yes, it does.
Happy days.

01:18.840 --> 01:23.800
You know, others may find your
cynicism bracing, Mrs. Florrick.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.704
I find it charming.

01:25.750 --> 01:26.739
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentleman,
Colin Sweeny.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.714
Okay, here we go.
First line?

01:28.750 --> 01:32.618
I believe in stem cells.
That is our future.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.410
Good!

01:33.460 --> 01:35.883
(applause, booing)
Boos? Really?

01:35.920 --> 01:38.582
How gauche.

01:40.860 --> 01:41.895
SWEENEY:
Ladies and gentlemen...
He's weird with you.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.591
Yep.

01:43.630 --> 01:46.235
...my company has been
mismanaged.
(cell phone rings)

01:46.270 --> 01:48.534
It has seen seen
its value drop by 30%...

01:48.570 --> 01:49.639
Yeah, what's wrong?

01:49.670 --> 01:51.467
We're being evicted.
We're not being evicted. Here...

01:51.510 --> 01:52.909
That's what he said,
he said 90 days.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.168
Don't dramatize it.

01:54.210 --> 01:56.576
He said it's a condo conversion.
Walt, waIt,
what's going on?

01:56.610 --> 01:58.441
Mr. Pedrono
from the eighth floor,

01:58.480 --> 01:59.640
he's here to inspect
the apartment, and tell us

01:59.680 --> 02:01.568
to get out in 90 days.

02:01.620 --> 02:04.145
This is going on now?

02:04.190 --> 02:05.680
I can talk to her
if she wants.
Do you want to talk to him?

02:05.720 --> 02:07.210
Yeah, put him on.
Alicia, come on.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.409
Mrs. Florrick,

02:08.460 --> 02:10.189
I didn't want you to get
the wrong impression.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.751
Um, what's good news,
Mr. Pedrono?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.519
We're giving all the tenants
a chance to own and not rent.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.889
I told your husband
about it a year ago.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.830
You told Peter?
Oh, yes.

02:19.870 --> 02:21.929
We've had this
in the works for a while.

02:21.970 --> 02:23.403
Your lease is up in 90 days,

02:23.440 --> 02:24.839
and we're giving you
a chance to purchase.

02:24.870 --> 02:26.633
Um, so we're being
threatened with eviction?

02:26.680 --> 02:27.874
No, you're being
given the chance

02:27.910 --> 02:29.207
of first refusal to purchase

02:29.250 --> 02:30.547
as is your right
as a current tenant.

02:30.580 --> 02:32.172
Okay, let's talk

02:32.220 --> 02:33.778
later today, Mr. Pedrono.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.641
But for the moment, please delay
your inspection, okay?

02:36.690 --> 02:37.884
If that's what you'd like.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.559
But please get back to me soon--
we need to know your plans.

02:40.590 --> 02:41.784
You'll be the
first person I'll call.

02:41.820 --> 02:43.720
Multitasking?
Like you wouldn't believe.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.751
So, where are we
on speakers?

02:45.790 --> 02:47.394
Um, Drescher's side has
five at microphones.

02:47.430 --> 02:48.852
Yes, Peter,
when you get this message,

02:48.900 --> 02:50.788
call me back. Thanks.

02:50.830 --> 02:53.230
There is something else,
I just happened

02:53.270 --> 02:56.603
to overhear Drescher's
lawyer on her cell.
ELI: Just happened?

02:56.640 --> 02:58.198
More or less. _
She was celebrating

02:58.240 --> 02:59.901
because they just
moved some late shares

02:59.940 --> 03:00.929
to Drescher's column.

03:02.410 --> 03:03.707
Wishful thinking?
Sounded real.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.604
Sounded like she has
enough to beat Sweeney.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.470
36,800 shares.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.818
Which mutual fund
is in play?

03:09.850 --> 03:11.943
I don't know. I thought
everyone was firmed up.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.810
Caitlin, hi.
Are you in the war room?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.953
Yes.
Is Diane there?

03:15.990 --> 03:17.389
No, he went out
about an hour ago.

03:17.430 --> 03:20.251
Who do we have
with 36,800 shares?

03:20.300 --> 03:21.722
Uh, let me check.
Uh, It's Alicia.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.490
Which of the mutual funds
has 36,800 votes?

03:24.530 --> 03:26.669
(overlapping chatter)
We're checking.

03:26.700 --> 03:27.792
It doesn't sound familiar.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.761
It doesn't, does it?
Is Will there?

03:28.800 --> 03:29.835
Yes, in his office.

03:29.870 --> 03:31.406
Well, this used to be his case,

03:31.440 --> 03:32.771
so see_ if that
number rIngs a bell.

03:32.810 --> 03:34.801
Okay, he's in with somebody.
Well, interrupt him.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.774
We have ten minutes
till the vote.

03:36.810 --> 03:38.471
DEERFIELD:
You're suspended
for six months, Will.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.410
This is serious business.
I'm not sayIng It's not.

03:40.450 --> 03:43.248
But I'm more than a lawyer.
I run a business here.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.848
DEERFIELD:
Which is why the
disciplinary board is

03:44.890 --> 03:46.858
allowing you to be here,
in your office,

03:46.890 --> 03:48.551
but that's all.
Then tell me the rules.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.353
If you want there
to be no crossover,

03:50.390 --> 03:52.494
then tell me what I can't...
CAITLIN: I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner,

03:52.530 --> 03:53.997
Alicia said she needs
an answer rIght now.

03:54.030 --> 03:56.260
What's wrong?
She's at
the proxy fight.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.767
They're worried 36,800 shares

03:57.800 --> 03:59.734
have switched sides and they
don't know which ones.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.465
Okay, here we go, Lionel.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.503
Does my suspension prevent me
from answering that question?

04:04.540 --> 04:06.508
Well, does the question
have to do with

04:06.540 --> 04:07.768
the legal side of Lockhart/
Gardner, or the business side?

04:07.810 --> 04:09.801
Mr. Sweeney is a
client we represent

04:09.850 --> 04:11.044
both criminally
and financially.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.378
But at the moment,
we've been asked

04:13.420 --> 04:14.648
to consult on
his proxy fight.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.511
Legally consult?
And financially.

04:16.550 --> 04:17.414
ALICIA:
Caitlin.

04:17.450 --> 04:18.781
We're nearing a vote.

04:18.820 --> 04:20.788
I know, Mr. Gardner is trying
to figuring out whether
he can answer.

04:20.820 --> 04:22.481
And if Caitlin
rephrases the question

04:22.530 --> 04:23.952
as a business-only question?
Such as?

04:23.990 --> 04:25.457
How many proxy votes,
absent any...

04:25.490 --> 04:27.799
Will, you can't
give her the question.

04:27.830 --> 04:28.819
She has to ask the question.

04:28.860 --> 04:29.758
(sighs)
You're kidding.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.791
To advise a subordinate
on a legal question

04:31.830 --> 04:33.468
is to offer legal advice.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.298
Okay, then we just sit here.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.604
How about Mr. Gold?
WILL: Yes.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.801
Part of our firm is
Mr. Gold's crisis management.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.638
Can _she ask me a
question as to that?

04:45.750 --> 04:47.513
Sure, go ahead.
Take your time.

04:49.750 --> 04:53.356
She can ask questions regarding
the crisis management,

04:53.390 --> 04:56.427
but she has to formulate
the questions.

04:57.860 --> 05:00.397
Hold on.
(clears throat)

05:00.430 --> 05:03.922
Mr._Gold is concerned
his client Will lose

05:03.970 --> 05:08.339
the proxy fight due to
the loss of 36,800 votes.

05:08.370 --> 05:10.634
Do you have any idea
who they might belong to?

05:14.540 --> 05:15.768
Tenley Mutual.

05:15.810 --> 05:19.109
Diane's leaving there now. Try
her cell and you might get her.

05:19.150 --> 05:22.938
No, thank you.
We'll be in touch.
(cell phone rings)

05:22.990 --> 05:24.639
Hello, Caitlin.

05:24.690 --> 05:27.909
Uh, yes, I had to
switch off during the meeting.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.882
No, we're leaving now.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.956
Hold on a minute.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.660
Mr. Tenley.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.099
Did you just lie to me?

05:43.140 --> 05:44.869
SWEENEY:
I'm stronger for it.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.434
I'm tougher for it.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.074
And I'm ready
to retake the reigns

05:49.110 --> 05:50.907
of the company I created.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.941
(applause)

05:52.980 --> 05:54.971
He said he told you
a year ago.

05:55.020 --> 05:57.944
He's lying.
I never met a Mr. Pedrono.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.753
You know what he's doing,
don't you?

05:59.790 --> 06:01.087
Establishing a timeline.
That's right.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.519
He needs to give fair warning

06:02.560 --> 06:03.481
before he can enforce
an eVIction.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.485
Would you sign an affidavit
to that effect?

06:04.530 --> 06:07.658
I will. But you should
think about doing it.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.497
Buying.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.862
Oh, I don't know.

06:11.900 --> 06:12.992
You like it.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.132
The kids like it.

06:14.170 --> 06:15.990
It's a lot of debt to take on.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.133
I thought you were making the
really big bucks over there.

06:18.170 --> 06:21.003
(chuckles)
Yeah, that's me.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.871
Okay, I'll talk to
you later, Peter.

06:24.810 --> 06:26.675
Oh, uh, hey, it's Eli.
We have a problem.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.039
PETER:
When don't we have
a problem, Eli?

06:28.080 --> 06:29.911
Were you just on with Alicia?
Was I?

06:29.950 --> 06:30.780
Yeah, why?

06:30.820 --> 06:33.687
You just sounded...

06:33.720 --> 06:35.984
good together. I was
standing right next to her.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.727
Eli, stop scheming.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.729
Know, what's hurting my
chances to being governor today?

06:41.760 --> 06:43.591
A blog called
the "Cook County-ienne."

06:43.630 --> 06:45.666
It says the State's Attorney's
office is a hotbed

06:45.700 --> 06:47.759
of workplace sex,
and that you approve of it.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.869
And when is a blog ever wrong?

06:48.900 --> 06:50.936
Peter, it is specific.
It says that

06:50.970 --> 06:52.870
two ASAs had sex on your office

06:52.910 --> 06:54.571
couch three nights ago.

06:55.980 --> 06:59.575
Eli, we can't listen to every
stupid piece of gossip.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.871
Yes, but we can be responding

07:00.920 --> 07:02.649
to every piece
that involves you and sex.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.908
We are vulnerable
on sex issues, Peter,

07:04.950 --> 07:07.054
for reasons I hope
I don't have to spell out.

07:07.090 --> 07:09.888
You swore you would run
a clean office. This is dirty.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.784
So, we can get him
back on our side?

07:11.830 --> 07:14.094
DIANE:
They'll swing the 36,800 shares
to Sweeney

07:14.130 --> 07:16.121
if he guarantees them
another seat on the board.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.094
Oh, that shouldn't
be a problem.
And one more thing.

07:18.130 --> 07:19.893
No more drama.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.158
That's why Drescher
convinced them to peel away.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.758
Sweeney is too high maintenance.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.835
You're asking me
to guarantee no more drama

07:25.870 --> 07:27.098
from Mr. Sweeney?

07:27.140 --> 07:30.075
Can you guarantee he won't kill
anyone in the next five minutes?

07:30.110 --> 07:32.510
Well, I think that
shouldn't be a problem.

07:32.550 --> 07:34.848
Okay, well, Tenley will call in
his vote, and he's in our camp.

07:34.880 --> 07:35.972
How's Sweeney doing?

07:36.020 --> 07:39.012
SWEENEY:
First of all,
thank you for that question.

07:39.050 --> 07:42.156
Or should I thank your boss,
Mr. Drescher,

07:42.190 --> 07:44.556
for the question
he asked you to ask?
He's very good at this.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.182
IfI had stock,
I might even vote for him.

07:46.230 --> 07:48.095
Good. And good job, Alicia.

07:48.130 --> 07:49.563
I know how hard this Sweeney
business is on you.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.797
Oh, I'm fine.
But thank you.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.990
In fact, Diane, um,

07:55.040 --> 07:57.907
can we talk sometime
about things?

07:57.940 --> 07:59.532
Well, that sounds ominous.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.070
Oh, no, I just, I mean, salary.

08:01.110 --> 08:02.031
I hate discussing this,

08:02.080 --> 08:03.638
but I thought being
on the partner track...

08:03.680 --> 08:05.807
Well, we'll talk about it.

08:05.850 --> 08:07.112
Let's just get Sweeney in
as CEO,

08:07.150 --> 08:08.117
and then we can talk about
a raise.

08:08.150 --> 08:09.845
Okay?
Okay. Thanks Diane.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.585
Hi, I'm Isobel Swift.

08:11.620 --> 08:16.011
_I work here as a contractor
in executive event planning.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.652
Do you recognize me,
Mr. Sweeney?

08:17.690 --> 08:19.920
Um, no, I'm-I'm sorry.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.097
Who are you?

08:21.130 --> 08:22.995
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh? Why uh-oh?

08:23.030 --> 08:24.065
Drama.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.125
The woman you sexually harassed
when you hired me,

08:26.170 --> 08:29.936
and who you threatened to fire
when I wouldn't sleep with you.

08:29.970 --> 08:32.768
And the women who intends
to sue you

08:32.810 --> 08:34.232
and Herald Equity
for sexual harassment.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.975
SWEENEY:
Young woman,

08:36.010 --> 08:37.773
you know for a fact
that's not true.

08:37.810 --> 08:40.574
Then how do you
explain this?

08:42.720 --> 08:46.178
Meet your son, Mr. Sweeney.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.669
PEDRONO: The ninth floor,
north-facing.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.167
That's some of our best views.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.632
I understand, Mr. Pedrono.
How much are we talking?

09:06.680 --> 09:07.806
For your four bedroom?

09:07.840 --> 09:09.102
It's three bedroom and a bonus.

09:09.140 --> 09:11.847
Your three-and-a-half bedroom,
it's $1.2 million.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.610
But remember,
you can get great financing.

09:14.650 --> 09:16.618
And that's everything in?
What do you mean?

09:16.650 --> 09:18.618
I mean, I know when these
tenant-conversions go condo,

09:18.650 --> 09:19.981
they sometimes have add-ons.

09:20.020 --> 09:21.851
Well, you'll have to purchase
the parking space.

09:21.890 --> 09:23.926
And there will be a monthly
charge for the association fees.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.029
And that'll run me...?

09:25.060 --> 09:26.652
$35,000 for the parking,

09:26.700 --> 09:28.224
and 2,000 a month
for the association.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.728
Thank you. I'll get back to you.
CAITLIN: We lost the proxy vote,

09:30.770 --> 09:32.829
but we've applied for an
immediate injunction

09:32.870 --> 09:34.861
against the vote results.
Unfortunately...

09:34.900 --> 09:36.663
DIANE: There seems to be a
narrative of unfortunately's.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.736
CAITLIN: Yes. Unfortunately,
we are up against a deadline.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.600
Mr. Sweeney lost
the proxy fight,

09:41.640 --> 09:43.949
so, the law requires
he liquidate

09:43.980 --> 09:45.675
his shares in 72 hours.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.315
So we have _72 hours
to Win an injunction?
Yes.

09:48.350 --> 09:50.989
And we must prove
two things in court.

09:51.020 --> 09:52.954
One, Isobel Swift's
accusations are a lie.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.309
That the paternity
is a lie?

09:54.360 --> 09:56.954
DAVID: No, the sexual
harassment is a lie.

09:56.990 --> 09:59.891
And the only proof of harassment
is paternity, so I'm applying

09:59.930 --> 10:01.989
for an immediate paternity test.
Go ahead, Caitlin.

10:02.030 --> 10:04.863
And second, we have
to prove this accusation

10:04.900 --> 10:06.959
was intended to throw
the proxy vote.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.332
If Drescher is
behind Isobel's lies,

10:11.370 --> 10:12.928
and Drescher will be
precluded from running.

10:12.980 --> 10:13.901
DIANE: So you need
to prove a connection

10:13.940 --> 10:16.647
between Isobel and Drescher?

10:16.680 --> 10:18.898
Yes. I am going to court today.

10:18.950 --> 10:21.839
WILL: Actually, you're going to
court today, aren't you, Alicia?

10:21.880 --> 10:23.882
Yes, Caitlin and I.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.013
DIANE: Good.
And everybody knows the rules

10:26.050 --> 10:27.779
regarding Will's suspension.

10:27.820 --> 10:30.926
You can't_talk to me
about speCIfic legal cases.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.996
But you can confer
with me on issues

10:33.030 --> 10:34.691
dealing with Eli's business.

10:34.730 --> 10:35.992
When in doubt,
talk to me about

10:36.030 --> 10:37.429
what can be discussed
with Will and what cannot.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.688
So what does Mr. Sweeney
say about this woman?

10:39.740 --> 10:40.889
Um...

10:42.970 --> 10:45.336
He didn't touch her.
He hired her. But that's all.

10:45.370 --> 10:48.828
And we_ believe him?
Well, the timing of Isobel's
accusations seem suspicious.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.438
So, guardedly, yes.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.675
Good, so let's get moving.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.111
Thank you.

11:02.090 --> 11:03.057
You're on it, right?

11:03.090 --> 11:05.251
Finding a connection
between Drescher and Isobel?

11:05.290 --> 11:06.257
Yep.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.951
Alicia.
Yeah?

11:08.000 --> 11:08.955
Watch out

11:09.930 --> 11:11.363
I know, but I'm tired
of being paranoid.

11:11.400 --> 11:12.367
She's just hungry.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.992
Like a piranha.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.031
She's hiding
something.

11:18.140 --> 11:19.971
_ It's not about
havmg sex on my couch.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.308
(scattered chuckling)

11:22.340 --> 11:24.342
It's about perception.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.975
I want you to talk to your ASAs.

11:29.020 --> 11:30.749
Informally.

11:30.790 --> 11:34.009
Four days ago,
who had sex in this office?

11:34.060 --> 11:35.880
Cary will coordinate.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.854
The rules are
very clear, people.

11:37.890 --> 11:39.994
No fraternization
between coworkers.

11:40.030 --> 11:43.158
I'm not gonna let this office
devolve into a frat house.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.021
Not gonna happen.

11:46.070 --> 11:47.799
Ironic, huh?

11:47.840 --> 11:48.989
What's that?

11:49.040 --> 11:52.032
You, investigating
fraternization

11:52.070 --> 11:53.435
in the State's Attorney's
office,

11:53.480 --> 11:55.175
when your relationship
with ASA Dana Lodge

11:55.210 --> 11:56.177
might be interpreted as such.

11:56.210 --> 11:58.371
Do you have something
you want to say, Geneva?

11:58.410 --> 12:00.947
Just said it.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.049
SWEENEY:
Will I admit to

12:02.080 --> 12:05.982
the odd sexual dalliance
now and then?

12:06.020 --> 12:06.987
Course.

12:07.020 --> 12:07.987
I'm human.

12:08.020 --> 12:08.987
I like sex.

12:09.020 --> 12:09.918
Don't you, Your Honor?

12:09.960 --> 12:13.327
Mr. Sweeney, you enjoy
being inappropriate,

12:13.360 --> 12:15.920
saying things
intended to shock.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.962
You'll find that
doesn't work here.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.092
I am not charmed.

12:19.130 --> 12:20.097
My apologies,

12:20.140 --> 12:21.459
Your Honor.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.536
I will be more circumspect.

12:23.570 --> 12:25.435
ALICIA: Mr. Sweeney,
you did not

12:25.470 --> 12:27.335
have sex with Isobel Swift,
did you?

12:27.380 --> 12:28.438
No.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.345
She's not to my taste.

12:30.380 --> 12:31.802
Much too obvious.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.078
Objection, Your Honor.
Sustained.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.417
ALICIA:
But you did hire her?

12:34.450 --> 12:35.519
Of course.

12:35.550 --> 12:38.917
I needed someone
at Herald Equity

12:38.950 --> 12:41.157
to entertain associates
when they were in town.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.829
A sort of Fredo,
but prettier.

12:43.860 --> 12:47.250
What happened when Mr. Drescher
replaced you as CEO?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.154
Well, when I went
to prison,

12:49.200 --> 12:52.124
I cleaned _house to make room
for his app0intments.

12:52.170 --> 12:54.195
I thought that was
the gentlemanly thing to do.

12:54.240 --> 12:54.990
You fired Isobel?

12:55.040 --> 12:57.065
Yes, as part of
my housecleaning.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.066
And Isobel was rehired
by Mr. Drescher?

12:59.110 --> 13:03.240
Uh, Your Honor, I'm not sure why
Mrs. Florrick rewards the men

13:03.280 --> 13:05.908
_ in her narrative_ _
With a formal honorific,

13:05.950 --> 13:08.214
but women are demoted
to their Christian names.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.148
Well, clearly, it's because

13:09.180 --> 13:11.148
I want to influence
the judge somehow...

13:11.190 --> 13:13.055
Are you suggesting that I'm
trying to influence the judge?

13:13.090 --> 13:14.819
(meows)
FRIEND:
Thank you.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.325
Given that_ there
was no objection,

13:17.360 --> 13:20.056
please continue,
Mr. Sweeney.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.089
Thank you, Your Honor.

13:21.130 --> 13:24.258
Yes, Mr. Drescher rehired her.

13:24.300 --> 13:29.260
I imagine he was impressed by
Ms. Swift's tremendous work

13:29.300 --> 13:30.562
in soft-core movies.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.464
Objection, Your
Honor. Relevance.

13:32.510 --> 13:34.034
There's no jury, Ms. Adler.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.274
This is an emergency injunction.

13:35.310 --> 13:36.379
I know Ms. Swift

13:36.410 --> 13:39.538
worked in soft-core movies
before she changed careers.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.512
Overruled.

13:40.550 --> 13:41.574
SWEENEY:
I myself was

13:41.620 --> 13:43.212
impressed by her

13:43.250 --> 13:45.218
tremendous skills in this area,

13:45.250 --> 13:48.048
especially with one
particular film,
(clears throat)

13:48.090 --> 13:49.250
where she...

13:49.290 --> 13:53.249
But of course, I was surprised

13:53.300 --> 13:54.597
that Gerald kept her on.

13:54.630 --> 13:56.222
Gerald is, of course,

13:56.260 --> 13:58.023
Mr. Drescher over there.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.265
That's why I think
she's accusing me.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.938
Because she's angry
with me...

14:01.970 --> 14:02.937
Objection.

14:02.970 --> 14:04.130
I'll withdraw that.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.138
Save everybody time.

14:06.170 --> 14:09.139
Two dinner receipts, one
belonging to Gerald Drescher.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.307
He's the CEO of Herald Equity.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.376
And the other belonging to
Isobel Swift, his employee.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.309
Both for exactly the same
amount, down to the penny.

14:17.350 --> 14:18.442
Meaning?

14:18.490 --> 14:21.152
They both had dinner together,
split the bill in half

14:21.190 --> 14:23.522
and then expense-accounted it.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.982
And you want
to know...?

14:25.030 --> 14:26.520
How close they were.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.959
Did they leave together?

14:28.000 --> 14:28.955
Are they...

14:29.000 --> 14:30.228
Sleeping with
each other?

14:30.270 --> 14:34.331
Well, waitresses do have
the best gossip.

14:34.370 --> 14:36.292
Well, I've seen
them together.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.069
They did seem
pretty close.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.998
But she's a CEO slut.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.031
She's always hanging
on the CEOs.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.274
Like that other guy.

14:43.310 --> 14:44.402
What other guy?

14:44.450 --> 14:45.906
The one accused
of murder.

14:45.950 --> 14:47.178
Colin Sweeney?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.209
Yeah.

14:48.250 --> 14:52.141
She was here with him,
before he went to jail.

14:52.190 --> 14:55.387
And you observed
them together?

14:55.420 --> 14:59.083
Well, if by "together"
you mean, did I observe them

14:59.130 --> 15:01.451
slip into the men's room
for about 20 minutes

15:01.500 --> 15:03.627
and come out half undressed?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.023
Yes.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.567
All right, there was oral sex.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.305
But it was before I hired her.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.274
There wasn't sexual harassment.

15:14.310 --> 15:16.039
You perjured yourself,
Mr. Sweeney.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.945
How do you figure?
You said you never
had sex, ever.

15:17.980 --> 15:19.242
There was no real sex.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.372
There was oral sex.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.047
You didn't ask me
about oral sex.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.014
Oh, my God.

15:24.050 --> 15:25.586
So there was no vaginal
sex, is that right?

15:25.620 --> 15:26.712
Yeah.
You're sure?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.115
Yes.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.628
She performed oral sex
on five occasions.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.321
Nothing special.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.397
I found her businesslike and...

15:35.430 --> 15:36.658
Okay.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.167
What are you thinking?

15:38.200 --> 15:39.326
The paternity test.

15:39.370 --> 15:41.235
It'll come back negative.

15:41.270 --> 15:42.339
That's right.

15:42.370 --> 15:43.507
It's as if

15:43.540 --> 15:46.361
I'm telling the truth.

15:46.410 --> 15:47.502
Say a client perjured himself.

15:47.540 --> 15:48.609
WILL:_
Just any client?

15:48.640 --> 15:49.971
Yes.

15:50.010 --> 15:51.272
Because if this were
a speCIfic client,

15:51.310 --> 15:53.278
I could not legally answer.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.344
Any client.

15:54.380 --> 15:56.439
And you discover,
after putting him on the stand,

15:56.480 --> 15:57.344
he perjured himself.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.449
Without knowing it,
you suborned perjury?

15:59.490 --> 16:02.209
Then you can't question
him further, pursuant to

16:02.260 --> 16:03.989
the Code of
Professional Responsibility,

16:04.030 --> 16:06.419
not without knowingly
suborning more perjury.
Right.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.392
But_ now the
opposmg attorney

16:07.430 --> 16:09.398
intends to put another
witness on the stand

16:09.430 --> 16:10.624
to contradict him.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.297
With the truth?
Or another lie, I don't know.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.434
Can I use _this
perjured testimony,

16:14.470 --> 16:16.438
now in the record, to question

16:16.470 --> 16:19.303
this opposing witness?

16:19.340 --> 16:22.434
You must represent the interests
of your client.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.005
You were not aware of
the perjury when it happened.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.608
To not use_
that perjured testimony

16:26.650 --> 16:30.086
would be to poorly represent
your client.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.382
So, yes, you can use it.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.411
As if it were the truth?

16:33.460 --> 16:34.757
No, as if it's in the record

16:34.790 --> 16:36.348
as the testimony
of your client.

16:36.390 --> 16:37.425
That's what
Ithought

16:37.460 --> 16:39.052
The law is
an odd thing.

16:39.090 --> 16:40.250
It is indeed.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.518
Of course,
you're getting legal advice

16:42.560 --> 16:43.561
from a suspended lawyer.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.488
(chuckles)

16:45.530 --> 16:46.758
The only problem:

16:46.800 --> 16:48.563
if the opposing attorney
wants to put

16:48.600 --> 16:51.160
your client back on the stand,
your hands are tied.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.134
I can't elicit further testimony
that I know is perjured?

16:54.180 --> 16:55.499
Yes.

16:55.540 --> 16:58.441
That'll make it
one hard redirect.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.777
CARY:
So you were working that night,

16:59.810 --> 17:01.539
but you didn't go
into Peter's office?

17:02.820 --> 17:05.584
No. We were working the
65th Street burglaries.

17:05.620 --> 17:08.350
And you didn't go
onto the executive floor?

17:08.390 --> 17:10.551
No.

17:10.590 --> 17:13.195
See, here's the problem.

17:13.230 --> 17:16.427
The log shows you accessed
this floor on three occasions.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.690
Just tell me.

17:18.730 --> 17:21.369
Jeremy.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.732
We didn't do
anything wrong.

17:23.770 --> 17:25.362
But you had sex
in Peter's office?

17:25.410 --> 17:28.299
If I say "yes,"
w-what will happen?

17:28.340 --> 17:30.376
Peter just wants to make sure
it won't happen again.

17:30.410 --> 17:32.298
Nothing in my
permanent record?
That's right.

17:32.350 --> 17:33.476
We got bigger fish to fry.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.149
Just tell me what happened.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.512
ADLER:
And so Mr. Sweeney always
met you in hotel rooms?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.356
To have sex, yes.

17:41.390 --> 17:42.687
And that was _on
how many occa5ions?

17:42.720 --> 17:43.687
Eight occasions.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.254
Before he went to jail.

17:45.290 --> 17:47.258
While you were working
at Herald Equity.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.449
And then the
last time,

17:48.500 --> 17:50.468
when you resisted
him, you were fired?

17:50.500 --> 17:51.592
Yes.

17:51.630 --> 17:53.530
Thank you,
Ms. Swift.

17:59.210 --> 18:01.735
So, Isobel...

18:01.780 --> 18:05.238
Mr. Sweeney insists
you never had sex.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.544
Isn't _it a fact that
you're lying to us today?

18:07.580 --> 18:08.342
No.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.519
He testified on
his whereabouts

18:10.550 --> 18:13.678
on all the nights you
claimed to have had sex.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.256
Isn't it a fact?

18:15.290 --> 18:17.155
He's lying.

18:17.190 --> 18:19.886
And yet this is your only
argument in response?

18:19.930 --> 18:21.158
"He's lying."

18:21.200 --> 18:22.189
Yes.

18:22.230 --> 18:24.824
He sexually harassed me.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.532
Ms. Swift, my client
took this stand,

18:27.570 --> 18:29.538
and he swore to
tell the truth.

18:29.570 --> 18:31.458
He swore he
didn't touch you.

18:31.510 --> 18:35.401
He testified in great
detail on all the...

18:35.440 --> 18:38.409
on all the nights you claim
he was having sex with you

18:38.450 --> 18:40.509
that he was
somewhere else.

18:40.550 --> 18:42.541
How is this not a classic
he-said/she-said?

18:44.920 --> 18:48.310
Because it's not.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.454
Because...
I'm telling the truth.

18:51.490 --> 18:53.299
And that's all
you have to say?

18:53.330 --> 18:55.355
That is why we
should believe you?

18:58.270 --> 18:59.623
(chuckles)

18:59.670 --> 19:01.160
Nothing further.

19:02.670 --> 19:04.638
You're excused.

19:04.670 --> 19:05.898
Your Honor,
we'd like to recall

19:05.940 --> 19:07.635
Mr. Sweeney to the stand.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.477
We strongly object, Your Honor.

19:09.510 --> 19:11.444
Mr. Sweeney has
already testified.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.902
This is not a full trial.

19:12.950 --> 19:14.178
We are merely asking

19:14.220 --> 19:15.642
for an emergency injunction.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.489
FRIEND:
Yes, and Counselor Adler

19:17.520 --> 19:20.318
is merely requesting
a simple recall of your witness.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.952
I see no reason to deny her.

19:21.990 --> 19:23.821
We will adjourn
until tomorrow.

19:23.860 --> 19:25.487
(gavelbangs)

19:35.370 --> 19:36.530
And the square footage?

19:36.570 --> 19:38.208
Oh, it's not what you have
now, but you can put up a wall

19:38.240 --> 19:40.834
and split that bedroom
into two for the kids.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.768
Oh, any bigger kitchens?

19:42.810 --> 19:44.971
Told you
not to prejudge it.

19:45.010 --> 19:47.740
You're prejudging it.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.475
This is really
the best I can do?

19:49.520 --> 19:50.589
In your budget range,

19:50.620 --> 19:53.657
near the private school,
in a good neighborhood, yes.

19:53.690 --> 19:56.579
But more will come
on the market this summer.

19:58.590 --> 20:00.797
You know what's funny?

20:00.830 --> 20:02.650
What?
I have the perfect place
for you.

20:02.700 --> 20:03.724
You do? Where?

20:03.770 --> 20:04.794
A house.

20:04.830 --> 20:05.990
In fact, you've seen it.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.839
When? Oh, the last time
we looked?

20:07.870 --> 20:09.758
No, before that.

20:09.800 --> 20:10.607
Your house.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.837
My...?

20:13.880 --> 20:16.872
The people who bought
your old house in Highland Park,

20:16.910 --> 20:20.516
they're upside-down on it
and very, very motivated.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.347
(chuckles)

20:22.380 --> 20:23.483
No.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.589
That's what I thought.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.315
It's a little out of
your range, anyway.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.419
Uh, and weird.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.984
I mean, it
would be weird.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.726
You had 15 happy years there.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.852
Why would it be weird?

20:31.890 --> 20:33.721
Because it-it would.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.489
Maybe we're all
like salmon,

20:35.530 --> 20:39.569
just trying to swim upstream
to get back to our homes again.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.362
(cell phone rings)

20:40.400 --> 20:43.665
Oh, there's
your cell phone, again.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.462
Diane, hi.

20:45.510 --> 20:46.260
Yes.

20:46.310 --> 20:48.335
They recalled Sweeney
to the stand,

20:48.380 --> 20:49.631
and the judge
overruled my objection.

20:49.680 --> 20:50.442
So I think we...

20:50.480 --> 20:51.970
Yes, Caitlin already
filled me in.

20:52.010 --> 20:53.477
I think her
idea is right.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.646
Her idea?

20:54.680 --> 20:56.375
Prepping Sweeney.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.581
You need to question
him again on redirect.

20:58.620 --> 21:00.759
And the only way to
avoid further perjury

21:00.790 --> 21:01.609
is to prep
him for it.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.753
It's a tight ethical
line he has to walk.

21:03.790 --> 21:04.882
Yes, it is.

21:04.930 --> 21:05.885
Good luck with it.

21:05.930 --> 21:07.557
Have Caitlin keep me posted.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.488
She has good instincts for
a first-year, don't you think?

21:09.530 --> 21:11.521
I do.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.401
So, as long as it's my word
against hers, I'm fine, right?

21:17.440 --> 21:19.738
DAVID:
Your word is the problem here.

21:19.770 --> 21:21.374
The other lavwer will ask you

21:21.410 --> 21:22.331
about things
that actually happened.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.075
And this time, you have
to tell the truth.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.407
SWEENEY:
Of course.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.747
DAVID:
We can't advise you,
for example,

21:26.780 --> 21:30.716
to dispute Ms. Swift's
uncorroborated statements

21:30.750 --> 21:32.638
if you know them to be true,

21:32.690 --> 21:34.487
or attack
Ms. Swift's credibility

21:34.520 --> 21:35.680
any chance you get.

21:35.720 --> 21:39.326
Yes, I appreciate your not
advising me to do those things.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.828
ALICIA:
I'll also be asking questions
on redirect, Mr. Sweeney,

21:41.860 --> 21:43.521
and you need
to answer me truthfully.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.060
Do you understand?

21:45.100 --> 21:46.897
That is the only way
I can question you.

21:46.930 --> 21:47.965
Scout's honor, Mrs. Florrick.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.490
Now, if you'll excuse me,

21:49.540 --> 21:51.758
I have to get
my beauty rest before court.

21:53.010 --> 21:56.002
Telling the truth
is so... tiring.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.875
This will be good for a laugh.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.314
Hello.

22:05.850 --> 22:07.579
ALICIA:
Caitlin.

22:09.390 --> 22:10.880
Can I talk to you?
Uh, yes.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.899
We haven't had
much of a chance to talk.
I know.

22:13.930 --> 22:15.022
And I want you to take what

22:15.060 --> 22:18.769
I'm about to say as constructive
advice from a mentor.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.859
Okay.

22:23.070 --> 22:25.937
Don't ever undercut
your mentor again.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.803
Under... What do you mean?

22:28.840 --> 22:30.671
Your strategy was to prep

22:30.710 --> 22:32.746
Sweeney to avoid
further perjury?
Oh, my God.

22:32.780 --> 22:34.509
Diane cornered me
coming back from court.

22:34.550 --> 22:35.744
She just wanted to know

22:35.780 --> 22:37.418
where we were,
and I was just updating her.

22:37.450 --> 22:38.849
I don't want
any explanations.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.118
I just want you
to be proud

22:40.150 --> 22:42.755
of the way you
conduct yourself here.

22:42.790 --> 22:45.782
Being an associate
in a law firm,
people judge you.

22:45.830 --> 22:47.058
The point is,

22:47.090 --> 22:51.493
all you want to be
judged on is your work.

22:51.530 --> 22:53.498
Your work.

22:53.540 --> 22:57.169
I understand.
Good.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.804
I'll see you
in court.

23:06.750 --> 23:09.674
Yes, these are receipts
from the Evanston Tavern.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.883
I went there often
with Ms. Swift in 2008.

23:12.920 --> 23:13.750
For what purpose?

23:13.790 --> 23:16.554
To discuss events
she was planning.

23:16.590 --> 23:20.822
Given that she was
an events planner.

23:20.860 --> 23:22.498
So these were business meetings?

23:22.530 --> 23:24.669
Held 20 miles
from your office.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.724
Because you couldn't find

23:25.770 --> 23:28.568
a single restaurant
in Chicago that had a table.

23:28.600 --> 23:32.161
Not one _that can make an
authentic coq au Vin, no.

23:32.210 --> 23:35.509
Mr. Sweeney, isn't
it true that you

23:35.540 --> 23:37.804
and Ms. Swift repaired

23:37.850 --> 23:41.809
to the bathroom
at the Evanston Tavern
to engage in oral sex?

23:41.850 --> 23:43.215
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

23:43.250 --> 23:46.583
Isn't it relevant whether
Mr. Sweeney and Ms. Swift

23:46.620 --> 23:48.508
engaged in oral sex?

23:48.560 --> 23:49.754
Overruled.

23:49.790 --> 23:51.621
Mr. Sweeney, please
answer the question.

23:51.660 --> 23:54.857
Did I engage
in oral sex

23:54.900 --> 23:57.960
with Ms. Swift? No.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.888
Mr. Sweeney, you realize
you are under oath?

23:59.930 --> 24:03.161
Your Honor.
That'll do, Ms. Adler.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.963
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

24:12.210 --> 24:13.973
Just to confirm,

24:14.020 --> 24:15.942
Mr. Sweeney,

24:15.980 --> 24:18.016
prior to Ms. Swift's
allegations,

24:18.050 --> 24:20.018
no one had ever accused you of

24:20.050 --> 24:21.881
having a sexual relationship
with an employee?

24:21.920 --> 24:22.887
That is correct.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.023
And at the time,

24:24.060 --> 24:26.824
no one ever accused you
of having a sexual relationship

24:26.860 --> 24:27.997
with Ms. Swift?

24:28.030 --> 24:29.998
And that is correct.
Good.

24:30.030 --> 24:33.022
And I want to be clear here.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.561
Not only did I never
have oral sex

24:35.600 --> 24:38.660
with that woman,
or any sex,

24:38.710 --> 24:41.099
but I was suffering...

24:41.140 --> 24:46.578
from a skin condition
at the time.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.215
(laughs)
I couldn't have had oral sex.

24:51.250 --> 24:54.913
FRIEND:
Mrs. Florrick?

24:54.960 --> 24:56.916
Do you have
anything further?

24:56.960 --> 24:59.827
Your Honor, uh...

24:59.860 --> 25:01.999
pursuant to the Code of
Professional Responsibility,

25:02.030 --> 25:05.067
I have no further questions
at this time.

25:11.670 --> 25:14.070
Their excuses?

25:14.110 --> 25:16.078
No excuses.

25:16.110 --> 25:17.839
Just abject apologies.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.745
Levitas is the head

25:19.780 --> 25:21.008
of the financial
crimes unit,

25:21.050 --> 25:22.938
and Cooper's a second year
who works under him.

25:22.980 --> 25:23.947
So his direct supervisor?

25:23.990 --> 25:26.083
Yes. But...

25:26.120 --> 25:27.917
But what?

25:27.960 --> 25:29.587
Disciplining two gay men

25:29.620 --> 25:31.281
for having gay sex
is gonna look bad.

25:31.330 --> 25:34.697
Well, I'm not disciplining them
for their sexual orientation,

25:34.730 --> 25:36.129
or the type of sex
they're having.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.799
I'm disciplining them for
having sex in this office.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.161
I'm just saying.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.065
There are rules, Cary.

25:42.100 --> 25:44.204
And one of them is
zero tolerance

25:44.240 --> 25:46.606
for sexual liaisons
in the workplace.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.971
Especially,

25:48.010 --> 25:52.003
if you're in a
supervisory position.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.677
KALIN DA:
I found the connection

25:53.720 --> 25:55.210
between Drescher and Isobel.

25:55.250 --> 25:56.945
He made payments
to her anonymously,

25:56.980 --> 25:58.311
from a shell company
in the Caymans.

25:58.350 --> 26:01.080
Fantastic.
Tell Diane I'm on my way.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.281
That idiot! That bastard!

26:03.320 --> 26:04.685
Sweeney? What'd he do now?

26:04.730 --> 26:05.981
He fathered a son.

26:06.030 --> 26:07.850
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.869
Paternity test
came back. Positive.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.219
It's Sweeney's kid.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.969
For the last time,
I did not sleep with that woman.

26:20.010 --> 26:21.432
Well, unfortunately, the court

26:21.480 --> 26:24.870
does not recognize the doctrine
of immaculate conception.
Okay, look.

26:24.910 --> 26:27.344
Taking you at your word,
which we have no reason to,

26:27.380 --> 26:29.211
how could this happen?

26:29.250 --> 26:30.842
SWEENEY:
No idea.

26:30.890 --> 26:34.257
We never had vaginal sex.

26:34.290 --> 26:37.384
I had a client who lost a
paternity swt a few years back.

26:37.420 --> 26:39.854
He claimed there
was only oral sex.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.118
Turns out, his girlfriend
had a turkey baster.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.128
DIANE:
And so it devolves:

26:43.160 --> 26:46.288
from hopes, ideals, dreams,

26:46.330 --> 26:50.232
the glory of the law,
to a turkey baster.

26:50.270 --> 26:52.738
DAVID:
Immediately after Isobel
fellated you,

26:52.770 --> 26:53.805
what happened?

26:53.840 --> 26:55.171
She repaired
to the bathroom, right?

26:55.210 --> 26:56.768
Purse in hand.

26:56.810 --> 26:58.141
She closed the door.

26:58.180 --> 27:00.239
Emerges a few minutes later,

27:00.280 --> 27:01.372
rosy bloom on her cheeks.

27:01.420 --> 27:02.819
Oh, dear Lord.

27:02.850 --> 27:04.989
Mazel tov, Mr. Sweeney.
You're the proud father

27:05.020 --> 27:06.840
of 18 years of child support.

27:06.890 --> 27:08.312
Can we make
a fraud argument?

27:08.360 --> 27:10.214
Contraceptive fraud?
Yes.

27:10.260 --> 27:12.285
Well, it'd offset
the child support.

27:12.330 --> 27:15.219
But Isobel will claim _
Mr. Sweeney's sperm was a gift.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.818
She could do with it
as she pleased.

27:16.860 --> 27:18.760
To get the re-vote,

27:18.800 --> 27:20.267
first we had to show fraud
on Isobel's part.

27:20.300 --> 27:22.131
If we can demonstrate

27:22.170 --> 27:24.263
Mr. Drescher's knowledge
of contraceptive fraud,

27:24.310 --> 27:26.107
the court will _order
a new election,

27:26.140 --> 27:29.109
and he'll be precluded
from running.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.219
Okay, I'll revise
the injunction...

27:36.250 --> 27:37.979
What the hell
did you do to Caitlin?

27:38.020 --> 27:39.339
What did I...

27:39.390 --> 27:41.187
She's resigning.
She's quitting the firm.

27:41.220 --> 27:42.357
Why?

27:42.390 --> 27:44.153
You never wanted to hire
her to begin with.

27:44.190 --> 27:44.952
And I see the way
you treat her.

27:44.990 --> 27:47.049
The jealousy.
The mean girl act.

27:47.090 --> 27:50.218
You were supposed to
mentor her, not haze her.

27:50.260 --> 27:52.820
David, I have no idea what...
You don't make enemies.

27:52.870 --> 27:54.838
That's what you don't do.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.699
Peter fired Jeremy.

28:02.910 --> 28:04.844
I know.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.873
_ Zero tolerance
is zero tolerance.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.239
That's right.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.043
Unless you're white.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.911
He fires
Wendy Scott-Carr.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.053
He fires Jeremy.

28:17.090 --> 28:18.955
He demotes Dana.

28:18.990 --> 28:21.720
He promotes you over Matan.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.160
He promotes you
over me.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.225
Three ASAs who had double

28:26.270 --> 28:29.728
or triple your experience
and seniority,

28:29.770 --> 28:33.069
and the only difference
was the color of our skin.

28:33.110 --> 28:34.270
Go tell him.

28:34.310 --> 28:37.848
If you believe that,
go tell him.

28:37.880 --> 28:38.904
What, that his
bias is showing?

28:38.950 --> 28:42.044
No, that Dana and I
were fraternizing.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.308
That's what you want to say.

28:43.350 --> 28:46.183
Zero tolerance, right?

28:46.220 --> 28:47.380
SEE-Iii

28:47.420 --> 28:48.751
Why not?

28:48.790 --> 28:49.950
Because I don't do that.

28:49.990 --> 28:53.858
You want him to know,
you tell him.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.458
That's right.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.822
It's a bad economy for ideals.

29:04.340 --> 29:06.467
So we're moving?

29:06.510 --> 29:09.308
Well, I don't know
what we're doing.

29:09.340 --> 29:11.342
But we have
to move, right?

29:11.380 --> 29:15.043
We have to do something.

29:15.080 --> 29:17.116
I'm looking at our options.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.189
What?

29:23.220 --> 29:25.222
Your realtor friend came by,
and dropped this off.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.393
It's not...

29:32.430 --> 29:34.330
She was just saying
it was on the market.

29:34.370 --> 29:38.238
Do you see they still
have the old swing there?

29:38.270 --> 29:40.409
You broke your leg
on that swing.

29:40.440 --> 29:43.500
That swing almost killed you.

29:43.540 --> 29:47.579
I know, just I remember
Dad pushing me on it.

29:47.610 --> 29:49.339
ZACH:
They painted it, see.

29:49.380 --> 29:52.213
I like the old
color better.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.386
We don't have the money.

29:56.360 --> 29:59.022
I wish we did, kids,
but it's a lot.

30:12.410 --> 30:16.437
Alicia, Caitlin
has given notice.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.368
Yes, I've heard.

30:18.410 --> 30:20.298
I'm surprised.

30:20.350 --> 30:22.511
I'll stay as long as you need
to finish my work.

30:22.550 --> 30:25.383
But why, Caitlin?

30:25.420 --> 30:27.240
I... I thought you were
liking it here.

30:27.290 --> 30:29.110
Iam...

30:29.160 --> 30:31.128
so much.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.128
Ijust...

30:33.160 --> 30:37.893
I got the results back
two weeks ago.

30:37.930 --> 30:40.421
I'm pregnant.

30:40.470 --> 30:41.562
I'm getting married.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.160
I...

30:44.210 --> 30:45.336
Yes.

30:47.470 --> 30:50.075
Congratulations.
It's wonderful news.

30:50.110 --> 30:52.943
I explained how supportive
the firm can be

30:52.980 --> 30:54.538
in situations like these.

30:54.580 --> 30:58.016
We have a generous
maternity leave package.

30:58.050 --> 30:59.244
And child care.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.315
And s_everal _
telecommuting options.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.487
And I really am grateful.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.919
Really, I am.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.929
Ijust, um...

31:07.960 --> 31:12.465
Ijust, uh, I want to be...
What?

31:12.500 --> 31:15.196
A mom.

31:21.410 --> 31:24.447
Thank you.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.254
Well...

31:34.290 --> 31:36.554
Yes?

31:36.590 --> 31:38.649
You should talk to her.

31:38.690 --> 31:40.089
I will.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.199
DAVID:
Mr. Sweeney's

31:41.230 --> 31:43.050
sperm was not a gift.

31:43.100 --> 31:46.592
Your Honor, even assuming this
turkey baster fiction is true,

31:46.630 --> 31:49.565
the sperm at issue
was donated without
expectation of return.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.602
Ergo, a gift.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.529
Mr. Lee, you're arguing
contraceptive fraud.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.707
Your position
is Mr. Sweeney's

31:56.740 --> 32:01.109
property has been...
misappropriated?

32:01.150 --> 32:02.549
Your Honor,
does this even merit a response?

32:02.580 --> 32:07.279
The concept here is that
if the property were not
put to its proper use...

32:07.320 --> 32:09.550
Wait a minute. If we agree to
call it "property," Your Honor,

32:09.590 --> 32:10.682
then it was
abandoned property.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.426
And whoever claims
abandoned property

32:12.460 --> 32:13.484
has the right to put
it to any use.

32:13.530 --> 32:16.055
Okay, enough.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.192
I'm intrigued enough to allow

32:17.230 --> 32:19.460
plaintiff to argue
contraceptive fraud.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.491
Disgusted, but intrigued.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.064
Thank you, Your Honor.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.532
With the caveat...

32:27.610 --> 32:31.546
...that I have heard no evidence
to substantiate such a claim.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.172
And the burden of proof
remains with Mr. Sweeney.

32:33.210 --> 32:36.646
Then we would like to recall
a witness to the stand.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.513
These invoices reflect payments
Mr. Drescher made to you.

32:39.550 --> 32:40.744
How do you explain them?

32:40.790 --> 32:42.417
Compensation.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.327
Gerald recognizes the
value of a good employee.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.055
But compensation
from his shell company?

32:47.090 --> 32:48.057
I didn't know
where it came from.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.055
I just accepted it.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.522
And there was no quid pro quo?

32:50.560 --> 32:52.061
No...?

32:52.100 --> 32:54.660
No trade-off?

32:54.700 --> 32:57.567
No expectations Mr. Drescher

32:57.600 --> 33:00.160
would receive something
in return?
No.

33:01.210 --> 33:03.132
Just to clarify, Isobel--

33:03.180 --> 33:05.705
Ms. Swift--
your testimony

33:05.750 --> 33:08.446
is that your child is the result
of consensual sex

33:08.480 --> 33:10.448
between you and our client?

33:10.480 --> 33:12.448
Yes, of course.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.014
In February of 2008,
did you take a class

33:14.060 --> 33:16.187
about
artificial insemination

33:16.220 --> 33:18.586
at the Kenwood
Learning Center?

33:19.630 --> 33:21.450
Do you need a moment,

33:21.500 --> 33:22.797
Ms. Swift?
No.

33:22.830 --> 33:26.561
(clears throat)
I just needed to remember.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.591
Yes, I did take such a class.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.494
And did you ask the teacher
of that class

33:30.540 --> 33:33.259
how long sperm could survive
in a turkey baster?

33:33.310 --> 33:36.177
AD|__ER_:
Your Honor, objection. Hearsay.

33:36.210 --> 33:39.600
Actually, the question
is properly phrased.

33:39.650 --> 33:41.538
If Ms. D'Arcy went further

33:41.580 --> 33:43.673
and asked for
the teacher's response,

33:43.720 --> 33:46.689
that would be hearsay,
so you may answer the question.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.586
I don't remember
what I asked.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.394
I might have; I might not have.

33:54.430 --> 33:56.193
Nothing further, Your Honor.

33:56.230 --> 33:58.198
ADLER:
Ms. Swift,

33:58.230 --> 34:00.425
for the record,

34:00.470 --> 34:03.359
you never had
any quid pro quo with,

34:03.400 --> 34:05.561
or trade-offs,
with Mr. Drescher?

34:05.610 --> 34:06.736
No, I never did.

34:06.770 --> 34:08.408
Thank you. So if...

34:08.440 --> 34:09.532
And I wasn't going
to say this,

34:09.580 --> 34:11.548
but since I'm being
called a liar,

34:11.580 --> 34:13.741
I never asked anybody
about a turkey baster.

34:13.780 --> 34:15.316
Neven

34:18.120 --> 34:20.486
Uh...

34:21.520 --> 34:22.657
Counselor,

34:22.690 --> 34:25.284
anything further?
(clears throat)

34:25.330 --> 34:27.321
Actually, Your Honor,

34:27.360 --> 34:30.397
pursuant to the Code
of Professional Responsibility,

34:30.430 --> 34:34.491
I have no further questions.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.746
You did great today,
Caitlin.

34:48.780 --> 34:49.769
Really great.

34:49.820 --> 34:50.809
You don't_ have
to be nice.

34:50.850 --> 34:52.317
I'm fine.

34:52.350 --> 34:53.419
Those are...?

34:53.450 --> 34:54.656
Invitations.

34:54.690 --> 34:55.657
To the wedding.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.151
Sorry, yesterday
I must've seemed crazy,

34:59.190 --> 35:00.487
hiding them from you.

35:00.530 --> 35:02.657
I was just embarrassed.

35:02.700 --> 35:05.396
I'm...

35:05.430 --> 35:06.658
I'm sorry if I came down

35:06.700 --> 35:09.567
on you hard before.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.568
I think I may have
misinterpreted a few things.

35:11.610 --> 35:16.502
Office politics around here can
tend to make people paranoid.

35:16.540 --> 35:18.701
You didn't come
down hard, Alicia.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.445
You were great.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.277
You're a good lawyer, Caitlin.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.686
You're smart and clever,

35:25.720 --> 35:29.178
and you handled today's
questioning like a pro.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.881
You can't give this up.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.729
If you give this up
for someone--

35:32.760 --> 35:35.729
_ even someone
important to you--

35:35.760 --> 35:37.694
there's a chance
you'll regret it.

35:37.730 --> 35:41.291
I'm not giving it
up for my fianc.

35:41.340 --> 35:44.434
I'm giving it up for myself.

35:44.470 --> 35:46.233
I like the law,

35:46.270 --> 35:49.706
but I love my fianc.

35:49.740 --> 35:50.832
But you don't need to choose.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.370
There's no reason
why you can't work,

35:52.410 --> 35:54.241
be a wife and a mother.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.770
But I want to choose.

35:55.820 --> 36:00.712
Maybe it's different
for my generation, but...

36:00.750 --> 36:04.186
I don't have
to prove anything.

36:04.230 --> 36:07.882
Or if I have to,
I don't want to.

36:12.570 --> 36:15.539
I'm in love.

36:15.570 --> 36:17.788
Thank you.

36:21.540 --> 36:24.509
I'm sorry I wasn't
a great mentor, Caitlin.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.848
You were a great mentor.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.713
Thank you.

36:42.260 --> 36:44.421
This is Daddy's law firm,
Stanton.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.426
Oh, and these
are Daddy's lawyers.

36:46.470 --> 36:48.631
Hi.

36:52.970 --> 36:54.471
Mr. Sweeney,

36:54.510 --> 36:57.434
this is...
unexpected.

36:57.480 --> 37:00.938
Yes, well, Isobel
and I have reached

37:03.980 --> 37:05.447
We have.

37:05.490 --> 37:06.684
An affidavit

37:06.720 --> 37:09.314
pursuant to which my
beloved acknowledges

37:09.360 --> 37:11.282
she was impregnated by,
shall we say,

37:11.330 --> 37:12.888
unconventional means.

37:12.930 --> 37:16.457
And further acknowledges
Mr. Drescher's involvement.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.899
DIANE:
Remarkable.

37:17.930 --> 37:19.727
Yes, I'm always happy
to swap legal fees

37:19.770 --> 37:22.432
for a $20 million stake
in a public company.

37:22.470 --> 37:23.732
ALICIA:
Um, so, uh,

37:23.770 --> 37:26.830
the two of you are now...?

37:26.870 --> 37:29.475
Raising a child.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.378
Ain't it grand?

37:35.480 --> 37:37.448
Uh, Mr. Sweeney?

37:37.480 --> 37:39.311
Oh, I'll be right there.

37:39.350 --> 37:40.715
Get the elevator, Stanton.

37:42.090 --> 37:47.323
I'm happy if you two have
reached an amicable arrangement.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.920
But... are you sure
you're ready for this?

37:49.960 --> 37:51.928
What, being a dad?

37:51.970 --> 37:53.597
Oh, sure.

37:53.630 --> 37:55.029
How hard could it be?

37:55.070 --> 38:00.007
I'll call ifI need any
child-rearing advice.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.507
(elevator bell dings)
Hmm?

38:01.540 --> 38:03.474
Come on, Stanton.

38:03.510 --> 38:05.478
Daddy knows a wonderful place...

38:05.510 --> 38:07.501
(continues indistinctly)

38:10.380 --> 38:12.348
(door opens)

38:12.390 --> 38:14.608
PETER:
Oh.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.457
We can do this later.

38:16.490 --> 38:17.855
I've looked over
the department records.

38:17.890 --> 38:20.552
Actually...

38:20.590 --> 38:23.320
Sir, per your request that
I notify you of all violations

38:23.360 --> 38:26.329
of the anti-fraternization
policy,

38:26.370 --> 38:27.997
and in the spirit
of full disclosure...

38:28.030 --> 38:29.588
You don't need to offer me
any more names, okay?

38:29.640 --> 38:31.938
Actually, I do.

38:31.970 --> 38:34.029
I dated Dana Lodge.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.469
(sighs)

38:37.510 --> 38:40.479
How recent was this?

38:40.510 --> 38:42.011
We ended it a few weeks ago.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.817
Was this before we demoted her
or after?

38:47.850 --> 38:50.011
After.

38:50.060 --> 38:51.379
(groans)

38:51.430 --> 38:52.954
Notgood.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.399
I want to be clear that we did
not have sex in your office.

38:57.430 --> 38:59.489
Well, I'm relieved
to hear that.

39:01.770 --> 39:03.931
Bottom line, I thought
it was wrong for me to be

39:03.970 --> 39:06.063
pointing fingers if I wasn't
going to point one at myself.

39:06.110 --> 39:09.671
Well, I appreciate
your coming forward.

39:09.710 --> 39:11.541
It's brave.

39:11.580 --> 39:13.605
And it shows character.

39:13.650 --> 39:15.117
Thank you.

39:15.150 --> 39:16.811
So let's just
leave it at that.

39:20.450 --> 39:22.816
At...?

39:22.860 --> 39:25.420
What-what—what do you mean?

39:25.460 --> 39:27.678
Cary, I don't condone
what you did,

39:27.730 --> 39:29.789
but I know you.

39:29.830 --> 39:33.766
And I know your heart
is in the right place.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.496
So.... let'sjust
leave it at that.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.064
I'm sorry,

39:38.100 --> 39:40.000
sir, you said the rules have
to apply to everybody.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.166
They do.

39:41.210 --> 39:42.632
But not to me?

39:43.640 --> 39:45.471
Does anyone else know
about you and Dana?

39:45.510 --> 39:46.772
Yeah.

39:46.810 --> 39:48.812
(exasperated sigh)

39:51.220 --> 39:52.448
I think I need to resign.

39:52.490 --> 39:54.458
Absolutely not.

39:54.490 --> 39:57.755
Then I think I need to be placed
on temporary leave.

39:57.790 --> 39:59.849
There has to be
some consequence,

39:59.890 --> 40:02.199
or I'm going to lose respect
around here,

40:02.230 --> 40:03.527
and so are you.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.526
(sighs)

40:06.570 --> 40:09.835
Let me...

40:09.870 --> 40:12.737
Let me think about it, okay?

40:14.480 --> 40:16.698
Thank you.

40:18.610 --> 40:19.804
(door opens)

40:21.550 --> 40:24.212
ALICIA:
I don't think
there's much to get.

40:24.250 --> 40:25.319
She's not very conflicted.

40:25.350 --> 40:27.784
I'm not sure the glass ceiling
was broken for this.

40:27.820 --> 40:29.788
Actually, it probably was.

40:31.190 --> 40:33.829
She'll be back
in 15 years.

40:33.860 --> 40:34.997
Like you.

40:35.030 --> 40:37.157
No, I don't think so.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.590
You wanted to discuss salary?

40:40.630 --> 40:41.836
I did.

40:41.870 --> 40:43.565
I do.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.899
Well, let me gather with Will,
and see what we can do.

40:46.940 --> 40:49.932
It might not be
everything you want.

40:49.980 --> 40:52.972
I understand.

40:53.010 --> 40:55.012
(water sprinkler running)

41:17.700 --> 41:19.258
Four bedrooms, four baths,

41:19.310 --> 41:21.608
but it's definitely adaptable.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.699
This part of Highland Park

41:23.740 --> 41:26.004
is very friendly
to new construction.

41:26.050 --> 41:27.506
(continues
indistinctly)

41:40.890 --> 41:43.723
* I..

41:43.760 --> 41:47.594
* On your father's face

41:54.010 --> 41:58.743
* The skyline

41:58.780 --> 42:01.749
* Is not seen for many days

42:08.020 --> 42:11.751
* It feels if though

42:11.790 --> 42:16.022
*_We're never
turning back here *

42:24.940 --> 42:26.908
* The dawn

42:26.940 --> 42:30.728
* It turns to the dust

42:39.990 --> 42:44.757
* Is there any way

42:44.790 --> 42:49.124
* To get this weight
off my skin? *

42:49.160 --> 42:51.594
* And find another one

42:54.670 --> 42:57.935
* Is there anyone

42:57.970 --> 43:01.701
* To get this writing
off the wall *

43:02.880 --> 43:05.348
* And find a new one?

43:05.380 --> 43:07.348
(inhales sharply)
