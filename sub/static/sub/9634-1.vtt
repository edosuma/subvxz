01:50.250 --> 01:52.667
[NARRATOR] Far away,
in an enchanted land

01:52.750 --> 01:56.084
that seemed untouched
by the steady march of time,

01:56.167 --> 01:59.584
there lived an old master
named Gohan who found

01:59.667 --> 02:03.375
a baby boy abandoned in
the wilderness of the region.

02:03.459 --> 02:06.709
The old master raised
the boy as his own child

02:06.792 --> 02:09.167
and marveled as
the youngster grew

02:09.250 --> 02:12.125
and became uncommonly strong.

02:12.209 --> 02:15.625
Now the boy,
known as Goku, is on his own,

02:15.709 --> 02:18.500
and has become the sole
guardian of his grandfather's

02:18.584 --> 02:22.584
most mystical possession--
his Dragon Ball!

02:34.875 --> 02:44.834
[birds chirping]

02:46.875 --> 02:50.375
[humming]

02:50.459 --> 02:51.875
[chatters]

02:53.167 --> 02:56.042
Hi! Just hanging around, huh?

02:56.834 --> 02:59.917
[GOKU laughs]

03:06.750 --> 03:08.167
[GOKU chuckles]

03:11.959 --> 03:13.709
[GOKU laughs] Yeah!

03:19.959 --> 03:29.917
[GOKU grunting]

03:34.584 --> 03:39.834
[yells slowly]

03:40.417 --> 03:44.209
[struggling]

03:45.959 --> 03:49.834
[GOKU] Hiyaaah!

03:54.334 --> 03:55.709
[chuckles]

03:55.792 --> 03:58.459
Well, that takes care of that.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.542
I'm hungry! Whoa!

04:01.334 --> 04:03.417
[NARRATOR] Little did
Goku know, a visitor was

04:03.500 --> 04:05.917
approaching his
remote mountainside home.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.959
The young boy's life
was about to begin

04:08.042 --> 04:09.792
a radical new phase.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.000
Totally radical!

04:15.667 --> 04:17.750
[sighs]

04:21.000 --> 04:23.500
Let's see here.
Oh, yeah, there it is!

04:23.584 --> 04:26.125
[GIRL] You're as good
as mine, you little jewel!

04:27.792 --> 04:29.375
[car engine starts]

04:31.750 --> 04:33.875
[GOKU] I'm going to
go get some food.

04:38.542 --> 04:41.417
Grandpa, stay there, okay?

04:41.500 --> 04:44.292
[GOKU] This won't take long.
I'll be right back.

04:47.209 --> 04:48.584
Huh...?!

04:50.584 --> 04:52.709
Uh. Golly,
I've never seen you

04:52.792 --> 04:54.792
shine bright like that
before, Grandpa!

04:54.875 --> 04:58.000
How strange!
Can you do it again?

04:59.334 --> 05:01.459
You can wait until
later if you have to.

05:01.542 --> 05:03.417
[GOKU] I'll see you
in a little while.

05:04.875 --> 05:07.250
[GOKU] Now what should
I have to eat today?

05:09.959 --> 05:11.834
Gosh, it's so hard to decide.

05:11.917 --> 05:14.084
Why don't you decide, tummy.

05:14.167 --> 05:16.125
Fish?

05:16.209 --> 05:18.167
[GOKU] Fish! Yeah! Ha-ha!

05:18.250 --> 05:20.542
That sounds really great!

05:20.625 --> 05:21.959
Alright!

05:22.042 --> 05:25.667
[laughing]

05:25.750 --> 05:28.834
[GOKU] Ah, but first, I'm
going to need a little snack!

05:30.584 --> 05:33.125
[GOKU chuckles]

05:34.125 --> 05:35.625
[grunts]

05:35.709 --> 05:38.584
[exaggerated eating sounds]

05:38.667 --> 05:40.167
That was good.

05:41.292 --> 05:42.584
Arh!

05:42.667 --> 05:44.875
[LION] Huh?

05:44.959 --> 05:47.500
[growls]

05:47.584 --> 05:48.584
Hm?

05:48.667 --> 05:52.000
[roars]

05:52.084 --> 05:53.500
Missed me!

05:55.709 --> 05:58.000
[LION growling]
[GOKU laughing]

05:58.084 --> 06:00.209
[GOKU] C'mon...!
Catch me if you can!

06:00.292 --> 06:01.750
[laughs]

06:01.834 --> 06:03.209
[GOKU] You're almost there!

06:06.167 --> 06:09.167
[yells]

06:13.667 --> 06:15.000
[GOKU giggles]

06:15.084 --> 06:16.709
Uh. Uh-ah!

06:16.792 --> 06:19.417
[GOKU yells]

06:24.250 --> 06:25.834
That was great!

06:27.042 --> 06:29.125
[GOKU] Mm. There.
That oughta do it!

06:29.209 --> 06:31.834
It'll be dry in no time!

06:31.917 --> 06:34.584
Here comes the waterfall!

06:34.667 --> 06:36.625
Huh? Hey!
It looks like now

06:36.709 --> 06:39.125
is a good time to do
a little tail-fishing.

06:42.875 --> 06:44.334
[GOKU] Come on,
you little rasals.

06:44.417 --> 06:46.250
I know you think
it's a giant worm.

06:46.334 --> 06:48.459
Take a bite!

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
[GOKU grunts]

07:05.125 --> 07:07.709
Wow! That's
what I call a fish!

07:09.000 --> 07:10.750
This oughta
last me until dinner!

07:10.834 --> 07:12.625
[GOKU chuckles]

07:13.209 --> 07:15.334
[distant car engine]

07:15.417 --> 07:18.084
Huh? What's that noise?

07:18.167 --> 07:19.042
[yells]

07:19.125 --> 07:21.459
[screams]

07:21.542 --> 07:24.000
[BOTH yelling]

07:24.084 --> 07:26.042
[GOKU] Aaahhh!

07:26.584 --> 07:28.584
Yikes! Is he dead?!

07:29.917 --> 07:32.667
What the--?!

07:32.750 --> 07:34.250
Wow! You're alive?!

07:34.334 --> 07:36.959
Rrrgh! So you thought
you finished me off?

07:37.042 --> 07:38.625
Well, you're not going to
get my fish that easy,

07:38.709 --> 07:40.250
you big monster!

07:40.334 --> 07:43.209
[GIRL] Ahh...! Stop it!
What are you doing?!

07:43.292 --> 07:44.792
[GIRL whimpering]
[GOKU grunting]

07:44.875 --> 07:46.667
This is for hitting me!

07:46.750 --> 07:48.750
[grunts]

07:52.959 --> 07:55.250
There! That'll teach
you to try to take my fish!

07:55.334 --> 07:57.125
Sneaking up on me like that!

07:57.209 --> 07:59.000
[GOKU] Well, I'm ready
for you this time!

07:59.084 --> 08:01.875
Why don't you come out
of your shell and fight!

08:01.959 --> 08:03.875
What's wrong?!
Don't tell me you used up

08:03.959 --> 08:05.959
all of your
power already, monster!

08:06.042 --> 08:07.250
Not quite...!

08:07.334 --> 08:08.750
[GOKU] Ow! Ooh!

08:08.834 --> 08:11.334
[groans]

08:11.417 --> 08:12.875
Uh. Hm?

08:12.959 --> 08:16.125
[GOKU groans]

08:16.209 --> 08:18.959
Holy cow! Whoa!
What was that?!

08:19.042 --> 08:22.125
But... How'd you...?
You shouldn't be alive, kid!

08:22.209 --> 08:24.584
[GOKU] So you thought you
finished me off again, huh?!

08:24.667 --> 08:26.667
Well Grandpa told me about
evil creatures like you.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.667
Your black arts
won't work on me!

08:28.750 --> 08:31.750
Alright monster!
It's your turn!

08:31.834 --> 08:34.333
Monster? Hold on!
I'm not a monster, kid!

08:34.417 --> 08:37.042
I'm a human being!
Just like you are!

08:37.125 --> 08:40.625
[GOKU] You are?!
Uh, ugh... Really?!

08:40.708 --> 08:43.125
Yes! Uhh...

08:43.208 --> 08:44.500
[GIRL] Of course, I am!

08:44.584 --> 08:45.584
[GOKU] Uh...

08:45.667 --> 08:48.209
You can see that
for yourself. Can't you?

08:48.292 --> 08:49.875
Look. I won't bite.

08:49.959 --> 08:51.917
Uh! Stay back.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.584
A human you say?

08:53.667 --> 08:54.667
[GIRL] That's right.
Wanna to see my

08:54.750 --> 08:57.167
certificate of authenticity?

08:57.250 --> 08:58.709
[GOKU] No thanks.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.584
How long is this
going to take?

09:02.667 --> 09:04.084
Will you hush up?

09:04.167 --> 09:05.834
Well, you look human enough.

09:05.917 --> 09:08.042
But you're different.
You're thin and scrawny.

09:08.125 --> 09:10.500
I'm a girl, silly. That's why.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.709
A girl? Oh, so
that's what you are.

09:13.792 --> 09:16.209
Oh my gosh!
Are you saying you've never

09:16.292 --> 09:17.459
seen a girl before?!

09:17.542 --> 09:18.917
[GOKU] Nope!
Besides my grandpa,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.834
you're the only human being
that I've ever seen!

09:21.917 --> 09:22.875
Uh?

09:22.959 --> 09:24.792
But Grandpa
told me about girls.

09:24.875 --> 09:26.625
He told me that
if I ever ran into a girl,

09:26.709 --> 09:29.417
that I should be as polite
as I possibly could.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.667
I see. Well!
What a nice thing to say!

09:32.750 --> 09:35.584
Your grandpa sounds like
a very wise man. Is he?

09:35.667 --> 09:39.084
[GOKU] Well, he was!
He died a long time ago!

09:39.167 --> 09:41.125
Huh?

09:41.209 --> 09:43.417
Shame on you! What do
you think you're doing?!

09:43.500 --> 09:46.500
I was just checking
to see if you had a tail.

09:46.584 --> 09:48.459
Huh? Oh...

09:48.542 --> 09:50.417
[GOKU] Don't worry!
Maybe it just takes girls

09:50.500 --> 09:52.209
longer to grow theirs!

09:52.292 --> 09:55.625
[GIRL] Ah-heh. I'm sure it'll
sprout up any time now, kid!

09:55.709 --> 09:57.709
What a weirdo!

09:57.792 --> 09:59.500
[GOKU] How did you
get that monster to do

09:59.584 --> 10:01.292
what you wanted it to do?

10:01.375 --> 10:04.875
That's not a monster, silly.
That's a car.

10:06.375 --> 10:07.542
Oh, so this is a car.

10:07.625 --> 10:08.667
Grandpa told me about them

10:08.750 --> 10:11.167
but I've never
actually seen one!

10:11.250 --> 10:12.875
[grunts]

10:12.959 --> 10:16.084
[GIRL] You know, for a little
kid, you're really strong!

10:16.167 --> 10:18.959
Thanks! Grandpa trained
me to be like steel.

10:19.042 --> 10:21.292
Hey. You were driving
a car around, right?

10:21.375 --> 10:24.292
So, does that mean that you're
from one of the big cities?

10:24.375 --> 10:25.834
You got it.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.792
Wow! Why don't you
come to my house with me

10:27.875 --> 10:29.334
and I'll cook you some lunch.

10:29.417 --> 10:31.417
[GOKU] You can tell me all
about the city you're from!

10:31.500 --> 10:32.250
Come on!

10:32.334 --> 10:33.750
Hold on! Just a second!

10:35.625 --> 10:36.792
[BULMA] It looks like
the Dragon Ball

10:36.875 --> 10:38.250
is right down the road!

10:38.334 --> 10:41.292
Maybe it's at
this little kid's house!

10:42.417 --> 10:45.417
[chuckles]

10:45.500 --> 10:46.709
I think it's safe to assume

10:46.792 --> 10:48.250
we're having fish for lunch.

10:48.334 --> 10:50.834
Well, alright!
So what's on the agenda?

10:50.917 --> 10:53.209
Well, we can have
a bite to eat and talk,

10:53.292 --> 10:54.542
then play together.

10:54.625 --> 10:56.250
Now look.

10:56.334 --> 10:58.000
If you think we're going to
do anything improper,

10:58.084 --> 10:59.209
you can forget it!

10:59.292 --> 11:01.584
Improper?
What does that mean?

11:01.667 --> 11:03.792
Oh, nevermind.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.292
[GIRL chuckles]
I guess Grandpa hasn't

11:05.375 --> 11:06.834
told him about that yet!

11:06.917 --> 11:09.750
This kid's so innocent
that he's adorable.

11:09.834 --> 11:10.625
[chuckles]

11:10.709 --> 11:12.625
Golly. Girls sure are strange!

11:12.709 --> 11:14.500
Well anyway, let's go.

11:14.584 --> 11:17.792
[GIRL] Sounds good! I'll
just follow the giant fish.

11:20.209 --> 11:22.834
So, kid.
What's your name anyway?

11:22.917 --> 11:25.167
My name is Goku.
G. O. K. U.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.834
[chuckles] What's yours?

11:26.917 --> 11:29.792
Uh... My name? Mine?

11:29.875 --> 11:31.500
Uh huh.

11:31.584 --> 11:32.750
Bulma.

11:32.834 --> 11:36.000
Hmm? Ha ha. That's funny!

11:36.084 --> 11:38.625
Hey, Goku's not
exactly normal, so there!

11:38.709 --> 11:41.459
[GOKU] Yeah, but it's
not as weird as yours!

11:41.542 --> 11:43.042
[chuckles]

11:43.125 --> 11:44.209
Hey, you be quiet!

11:44.292 --> 11:46.250
Bulma happens to be
very elegant!

11:46.334 --> 11:49.167
It's a lot better than Goku!
That's for sure!

11:49.250 --> 11:50.625
Hmph!

12:03.167 --> 12:04.375
[BULMA] Wow!
That's a nice little place

12:04.459 --> 12:05.667
you've got there, kid!

12:05.750 --> 12:08.417
[GOKU] Gee, thanks!
Just wait here one second.

12:10.209 --> 12:11.584
Huh?

12:14.542 --> 12:15.834
Listen.

12:15.917 --> 12:17.042
What's up?

12:17.125 --> 12:19.292
Grandpa's trying
to talk to me.

12:19.375 --> 12:22.292
But Goku,
I don't hear anyone ta...

12:22.375 --> 12:23.542
[BULMA gasps]

12:23.625 --> 12:26.750
Oh my goodness!
It's a Dragon Ball!

12:26.834 --> 12:28.250
[BOTH grunt]

12:29.542 --> 12:32.209
Hey! Give me
my grandpa back now!

12:32.292 --> 12:35.250
Your grandpa? You mean this?

12:35.334 --> 12:37.875
Yeah! This is the
only thing that my grandpa

12:37.959 --> 12:39.625
gave me to remember him by.

12:39.709 --> 12:42.167
Nobody can touch it but me.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.042
[GOKU] Look!
Look what it's doing.

12:44.125 --> 12:46.709
I think Grandpa's
trying to talk to me.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.584
What do you think he's saying?

12:48.667 --> 12:51.959
I hate to do this, but I
don't really have a choice!

12:52.042 --> 12:53.000
See!

12:53.084 --> 12:54.875
What?!
You've got to be kidding!

12:54.959 --> 12:57.334
You've got
two Grandpas! No way!

12:57.417 --> 13:00.875
They're not Grandpas.
They're called Dragon Balls.

13:00.959 --> 13:02.584
You sure about that?

13:02.667 --> 13:04.584
Definitely. I'm positive.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.167
Your ball started
glowing because it was

13:06.250 --> 13:08.417
reacting to
the two that I have.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.667
Look. Put yours down.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.917
[GOKU] Well... okay.
But just for a second.

13:14.542 --> 13:15.834
[GOKU] Oh.

13:15.917 --> 13:18.292
Pretty cool, huh?

13:18.375 --> 13:21.334
Yeah, these gems have the
power to do great things!

13:21.417 --> 13:23.667
And not so great!
Let's just say if a bad person

13:23.750 --> 13:25.000
got ahold of these balls,

13:25.084 --> 13:27.125
he could really
wreak some havoc!

13:27.209 --> 13:29.625
Well what do
these things do?

13:29.709 --> 13:32.042
Sure you want to know?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.667
Yeah!

13:34.834 --> 13:36.375
M'kay...

13:39.209 --> 13:41.375
Ah, there it is!

13:41.459 --> 13:43.375
[DOG] It's awfully
dark in there, Sire!

13:43.459 --> 13:45.334
[EMPEROR] Shut up, Shu!

13:48.917 --> 13:51.250
[EMPEROR laughs] Ahh...!

13:51.334 --> 13:54.000
Come to Emperor Pilaf,
my precious! Yes!

13:54.084 --> 13:56.334
[shrieks]

13:56.417 --> 14:00.250
[PILAF] Get off of me
you bone-head! Ewe!

14:01.750 --> 14:04.875
[bats chirp]

14:06.459 --> 14:07.917
Uh! [clears throat]

14:08.000 --> 14:10.417
Well, enough of that.
I'm ready to make my wish!

14:10.500 --> 14:11.584
--[WOMAN] Sir?
--[PILAF] What?!

14:11.667 --> 14:13.334
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

14:13.417 --> 14:15.292
but you can't make a wish
with just one ball,

14:15.375 --> 14:17.125
you have to have
the others as well.

14:17.209 --> 14:18.500
Mm! Huh?!

14:18.584 --> 14:20.417
[WOMAN] There are
seven Dragon Balls, Sire!

14:20.500 --> 14:22.334
You have to unite
all seven of them

14:22.417 --> 14:24.834
before the Dragon will
appear and grant your wish!

14:24.917 --> 14:27.209
Hm... More searching.

14:27.292 --> 14:29.209
[WOMAN] But just imagine,
dear Emperor,

14:29.292 --> 14:31.375
that glorious day
when the seven balls are

14:31.459 --> 14:33.084
finally brought together!

14:33.167 --> 14:36.042
A beautiful burst of
energy will light the sky,

14:36.125 --> 14:38.292
and in a blazing
surge of fiery power,

14:38.375 --> 14:40.375
the Eternal Dragon
will rise before you

14:40.459 --> 14:43.334
for the sole purpose of
granting you a single wish.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.209
Whatever it may be.

14:46.042 --> 14:48.084
[PILAF]
Yes! Yes! I can see it!

14:48.167 --> 14:49.625
Well, okay!

14:49.709 --> 14:52.625
I guess I can handle
a little more searching.

14:52.709 --> 14:53.959
[PILAF]
Any wish I want, huh?

14:54.042 --> 14:57.709
Well then, I want to
rule the entire world!

15:01.000 --> 15:02.625
[GOKU] Wow! That's amazing!

15:02.709 --> 15:04.459
You can wish for
whatever you want?

15:04.542 --> 15:05.709
And it will come true?!

15:05.792 --> 15:07.542
I wonder why
my grandpa didn't tell me

15:07.625 --> 15:08.917
about any of this stuff!

15:09.000 --> 15:10.417
He may not have
known about it, Goku.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.834
Not many people do.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.625
The truth is,
you and I are some of

15:14.709 --> 15:16.500
the few people in
the world that even know

15:16.584 --> 15:19.000
about the Dragon Balls
or the Dragon.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.584
Don't get mine
mixed up with yours, okay?

15:21.667 --> 15:23.209
Don't worry,
that's impossible.

15:23.292 --> 15:25.167
Each ball has a different
number of stars in it.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.625
See. This one has five.

15:26.709 --> 15:28.959
Oh, I get it.
Grandpa's ball has four stars.

15:29.042 --> 15:30.625
[BULMA]
Now you're catching on!

15:30.709 --> 15:32.042
[chuckles]

15:32.125 --> 15:34.042
I can't believe that I already
have three of the balls!

15:34.125 --> 15:35.959
If I keep this up,
I'll be able to wish for

15:36.042 --> 15:37.875
a boyfriend before
the end of the month!

15:37.959 --> 15:39.917
This is so exciting!

15:40.000 --> 15:41.750
You are going to let me
use your Dragon Ball

15:41.834 --> 15:43.250
so I can make
my wish, right?

15:43.334 --> 15:44.542
You can forget it!

15:44.625 --> 15:46.792
Grandpa gave me this ball
to remember him by.

15:46.875 --> 15:48.167
[GOKU] And I'm not
going to hand it over,

15:48.250 --> 15:49.667
just because you're a girl.

15:49.750 --> 15:51.209
[BULMA] But your
grandpa said to be as

15:51.292 --> 15:53.084
polite as possible to girls.

15:53.167 --> 15:54.125
Mm-mmm.

15:54.209 --> 15:55.250
Uh!

15:55.334 --> 15:58.292
Hey, I know what.
Look, I'll trade ya.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.750
Uh...?

16:02.167 --> 16:03.584
You let me have
your Dragon Ball,

16:03.667 --> 16:05.667
and I'll let you
have a little peak.

16:05.750 --> 16:08.459
What do I care about
seeing your dirty ol' fanny?

16:08.542 --> 16:11.834
It is not dirty,
you rude little boy!

16:11.917 --> 16:13.542
Well, shoot.
There's got to be a way.

16:13.625 --> 16:14.834
The hunt must go on.

16:14.917 --> 16:16.917
Hey, I know!
Why don't you come with me?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.167
We can be partners.
Whatd'ya say?

16:19.250 --> 16:20.834
Oh, go hunt balls?

16:20.917 --> 16:22.375
[BULMA] Sure, why not?

16:22.459 --> 16:24.667
You would get to see so many
new things and learn so much.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.625
Your grandpa would
be very proud of you.

16:26.709 --> 16:28.292
Really?! You think
Grandpa would be

16:28.375 --> 16:29.584
proud if I went?

16:29.667 --> 16:30.959
Of course he would, kid.

16:31.042 --> 16:32.875
Seeing his young
grandson that he raised

16:32.959 --> 16:35.417
venture out into
the world all on his own.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.292
[BULMA] Learning all
about the great cities,

16:37.375 --> 16:40.250
and crossing the desert,
and seeing the ocean!

16:40.334 --> 16:42.084
Alright, that sounds
like a lot of fun.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.375
I guess I'll go.

16:43.459 --> 16:46.209
This'll be great!
So we're partners?

16:46.292 --> 16:49.209
Alright. But I still get
to keep my grandpa's ball.

16:49.292 --> 16:52.292
You drive a hard bargain,
but have it your way.

16:52.375 --> 16:53.750
[BULMA]
The little kid's stubborn,

16:53.834 --> 16:56.292
but he'll make a good body
guard until I make my wish.

16:56.375 --> 16:59.625
I'll wish for the most perfect
boyfriend that ever lived!

16:59.709 --> 17:04.000
[BULMA] Well, here we go!
The start of a great adventure!

17:04.084 --> 17:06.500
Hey, Bulma! How do we
know where to start looking?

17:06.584 --> 17:07.750
The Dragon Balls
could be anywhere

17:07.834 --> 17:09.625
in the whole world, right?

17:09.709 --> 17:11.041
[giggles]

17:11.125 --> 17:12.750
Just who do you think
you're dealing with here, kid?

17:12.834 --> 17:14.750
I'm no amateur.

17:15.541 --> 17:17.041
Look--check it out!

17:17.125 --> 17:18.334
[beeping]

17:18.416 --> 17:19.875
Huh...?

17:19.959 --> 17:21.459
[BULMA] It's a special radar
that tracks the Dragon Balls.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.000
Look. See these three dots?

17:23.084 --> 17:24.459
These are our three balls.

17:24.541 --> 17:26.334
And these are
the other Dragon Balls.

17:26.416 --> 17:28.541
It looks like the
closest ball is right here--

17:28.625 --> 17:30.959
about 750 miles to the west.

17:31.042 --> 17:32.334
Is that far?

17:32.417 --> 17:34.292
Let's just say that it's
out of our walking distance.

17:34.375 --> 17:36.000
And since you destoyed my car,

17:36.084 --> 17:37.917
we'll be needing
a new set of wheels.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.375
Hmm.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.584
[BULMA] Let's see now.
What am I in the mood for?

17:42.667 --> 17:45.125
Ah! This one will
be fun for a while.

17:45.209 --> 17:47.709
Stand back, kid. Stay there.

17:47.792 --> 17:49.167
[grunts]

17:51.834 --> 17:53.834
[yowling]

17:53.917 --> 17:55.500
--Check it out!
--Whoa!

17:55.584 --> 17:57.875
Bulma! How did you do that?!

17:57.959 --> 18:00.292
You're some kind
of witch, aren't you?

18:00.375 --> 18:01.834
[BULMA] What? Nonsense.

18:01.917 --> 18:03.667
Witchcraft has
nothing to do with it.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.667
Everyone in the city
has dyno-caps.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.792
How could you
travel without them?

18:09.917 --> 18:11.042
Hey! Will you knock it off?

18:11.125 --> 18:14.167
Just hop on.
It won't bite you.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.125
[GOKU] I'm on.

18:15.209 --> 18:17.334
[BULMA] Okay! Here we go!

18:17.417 --> 18:18.459
Ah, aaahhh!

18:18.542 --> 18:20.417
Neato! This thing
goes even faster

18:20.500 --> 18:22.334
than I can run! Yep!

18:22.417 --> 18:25.375
No duh, squirt.
Get with the program!

18:26.917 --> 18:28.667
--[GOKU laughing]
--[MONKEY] Huh?

18:28.750 --> 18:30.084
[GOKU] Weeee!

18:30.167 --> 18:31.792
[chatters]

18:31.875 --> 18:42.167
â™ª

18:42.250 --> 18:43.459
[BULMA] Chill out, Goku.

18:43.542 --> 18:45.459
You're squeezing
the life out of me!

18:45.542 --> 18:46.834
[GOKU] Oops, sorry!

18:46.917 --> 18:49.000
[BULMA] Just relax. I happen
to be an expert driver.

18:49.084 --> 18:50.584
I'm in total control...

18:50.667 --> 18:52.875
--[BULMA screams]
--[GOKU laughs]

18:54.834 --> 18:57.625
[GOKU] Ah! Wow!
That was great, Bulma!

18:57.709 --> 18:59.417
Let's go back and
do it again. C'mon!

18:59.500 --> 19:02.959
That was so much fun.
Just one more time. Please!

19:03.042 --> 19:05.125
[BULMA] I almost lost it
big-time on that one.

19:05.209 --> 19:06.917
I need to be more careful!

19:07.000 --> 19:08.959
Hm? Uh, oh!

19:09.042 --> 19:10.417
Uh, excuse me
a minute, Goku.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.917
Time for a pit-stop.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.584
Uh, okay. I'll come to.

19:13.667 --> 19:14.917
Oh, no you won't!

19:15.000 --> 19:16.959
Don't the words "pit-stop"
mean anything to you?

19:17.042 --> 19:18.292
Stay right there!

19:18.375 --> 19:20.334
"Pit-stop"?
What does that mean?

19:20.417 --> 19:23.000
[BULMA] I need to pee,
you lame-brain!

19:23.084 --> 19:24.792
[GOKU]
Huh? I don't get it.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.792
Why can't she
just pee right here?

19:26.875 --> 19:27.917
How strange.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.709
[BULMA]
Goku! Come here! Quick!

19:30.792 --> 19:33.334
[GOKU] Huh? I sure wish
she'd make up her mind.

19:33.417 --> 19:34.917
Coming, Bulma!

19:35.834 --> 19:37.459
[BULMA screams]

19:37.542 --> 19:41.625
[TERANODON chuckles]
[BULMA screaming]

19:41.709 --> 19:43.625
Who the heck are you, kiddo?

19:43.709 --> 19:44.917
My name's Goku.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.500
Are... you a friend of Bulma's?

19:46.584 --> 19:49.709
[TERANODON chuckles]
[BULMA screaming]

19:49.792 --> 19:51.917
Yeah, that's it!

19:52.000 --> 19:54.709
As a matter of fact, we have
fancy dinner engagements

19:54.792 --> 19:57.917
but the reservations
are only for two!

19:58.000 --> 19:59.459
So...

20:03.167 --> 20:05.084
Gosh! I think he was lying.

20:05.167 --> 20:07.000
You're a regular Einstein!

20:07.084 --> 20:08.709
See ya!

20:08.792 --> 20:10.667
[BULMA screams]

20:10.750 --> 20:13.375
Hey, stop being
such a downer, baby!

20:13.459 --> 20:15.250
I'm in the mood for
a happy meal!

20:15.334 --> 20:17.042
[laughs]

20:17.125 --> 20:20.709
Hey! Where are you
guys going, Bulma? Huh?

20:20.792 --> 20:25.959
Don't just stand there,
idiot! Get! Me! Down!

20:26.042 --> 20:28.625
Well gee, I don't
blame her for being upset,

20:28.709 --> 20:31.334
but she doesn't have to
go calling me names.

20:34.459 --> 20:35.417
I'd like to help her down,

20:35.500 --> 20:37.584
but I really
don't know how to fly.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.042
Hey! I've got it!

20:40.959 --> 20:43.625
Let's see here.
How does this thing work?

20:43.709 --> 20:46.167
Bulma was able to make it
fly a few minutes ago.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.667
[GOKU] Whoa! It's moving!

20:48.750 --> 20:49.875
Come on, whatever you are!

20:49.959 --> 20:51.334
I know you can
go faster than this!

20:51.417 --> 20:53.334
We've got to get moving!
Bulma's in trouble!

20:53.417 --> 20:54.542
[engine excellerates]

20:54.625 --> 20:57.167
[GOKU yells]

20:57.834 --> 21:00.750
[BULMA]
Goku! Please help me!

21:00.834 --> 21:02.084
[GOKU] Hang on, Bulma!

21:02.167 --> 21:03.125
[chuckles]

21:03.209 --> 21:05.584
Yaaa!

21:06.209 --> 21:08.292
[BULMA screams]

21:12.125 --> 21:14.250
Hang on.
Just a little further.

21:14.334 --> 21:15.709
Huh?

21:16.542 --> 21:18.292
Goku, help!

21:19.084 --> 21:22.500
[laughs]

21:24.167 --> 21:25.792
Boo!

21:26.584 --> 21:28.500
Power Pole extend!

21:30.500 --> 21:33.209
Here! Take this
you mean ol' bully!

21:33.292 --> 21:34.750
[grunts]

21:36.000 --> 21:37.292
[screams]

21:37.375 --> 21:39.834
[wails]

21:39.917 --> 21:42.750
[groans]

21:42.834 --> 21:46.417
[screams]

21:46.500 --> 21:47.917
[GOKU] Here! Bulma!

21:48.000 --> 21:49.375
[chuckles]

21:49.459 --> 21:50.834
[grunts]

21:52.917 --> 21:54.459
Aaah...!

21:56.750 --> 21:58.500
[thud]

22:00.000 --> 22:02.417
[GOKU] Hm? Too bad.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.250
I really don't
like to hurt anybody,

22:04.334 --> 22:06.417
but he gave me no choice.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.250
[BULMA] Goku!

22:08.334 --> 22:09.334
Huh?

22:09.417 --> 22:12.875
[BULMA]
Aren't you going to help me?!

22:12.959 --> 22:16.667
Help! I'm having a bit
of a crisis up here.

22:16.750 --> 22:17.750
[bawling]

22:17.834 --> 22:19.459
