HAVE A JOB.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.931
NO. FOR ME TO
BREAK UP WITH YOU,

02:21.099 --> 02:24.143
THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE
SOMETHING BETWEEN US TO BREAK.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.130
THIS ISN'T EVEN MINE.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.758
YEAH, NO, THIS MUST BE
ERIC'S SHIRT.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.972
YOUR MOM SEWED YOUR NAME
IN IT, MICHAEL.

04:26.849 --> 04:30.018
MAN, ERIC'S
GONNA BE PISSED, HUH?!

04:35.108 --> 04:37.192
YEAH, 'CAUSE I... SEE,
I BORROWED ERIC'S SHIRT

04:37.360 --> 04:40.404
'CAUSE MINE WASN'T
WORKING RIGHT...

04:40.571 --> 04:44.491
AND THEN MY MOM MUST
HAVE SEWN MY NAME IN IT.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.371
MMM... I DON'T KNOW,
MICHAEL.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.664
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
I'M LYING?

04:50.832 --> 04:51.581
JACKIE, IF I WERE LYING,

04:51.749 --> 04:55.002
I'D COME UP WITH
A LOT BETTER LIE THAN THAT.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.380
YEAH, YOU'D THINK SO.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.677
SO, LAURIE'S
DEFINITELY MOVING OUT?

05:03.845 --> 05:06.722
AND IT'S DEFINITELY OVER
WITH HER AND KELSO?

05:06.889 --> 05:09.182
WELL, SHE IS MOVING
ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN.

05:09.350 --> 05:14.354
I MEAN, SHE IS SLUTTY,
BUT...

05:14.522 --> 05:16.064
I MEAN, SHE HATES
TO COMMUTE, SO...

05:16.232 --> 05:18.275
GOOD.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.735
GOOD, BECAUSE KELSO'S
A RAT BASTARD,

05:19.902 --> 05:21.862
AND I'M NOT COVERING
FOR HIM.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.323
DONNA, RELAX.
IT'S OVER.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.867
SO NOW YOU CAN GET BACK
TO PLEASING YOUR MAN.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.459

TALK TO DONNA ALONE.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.420
WELL, OKAY, 'CAUSE, I MEAN,
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS MY

05:38.588 --> 05:39.796

YOU WANT TO ASK ME?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.854
SEE, I'M KINDA WORRIED
ABOUT MICHAEL AND LAURIE.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.273
I MEAN, SHE FOUND
HIS T-SHIRT IN HER ROOM,

05:58.441 --> 06:01.568
AND HE SAID IT WASN'T HIS, EVEN
THOUGH IT HAD HIS NAME IN IT.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.320
AND AT THAT TIME,
I BELIEVED HIM,

06:03.488 --> 06:05.739
BUT NOW I CAN'T
REMEMBER WHY.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.240
BUT IF THERE IS
SOMETHING GOING ON,

06:07.408 --> 06:08.867
I THINK I WANT TO KNOW...

06:09.035 --> 06:10.243
BUT I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

06:10.411 --> 06:13.455
GOD, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I
WANT TO KNOW, YOU KNOW?

06:14.707 --> 06:15.791
I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY...

06:15.958 --> 06:18.085
DONNA, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY
THAT THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON,

06:18.252 --> 06:20.003
THAT MICHAEL LOVES ME,
AND WE'RE TOGETHER,

06:20.171 --> 06:21.880
AND THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.298
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.175
GOD, YOU'RE SO NAIVE!

06:25.343 --> 06:27.677
ISN'T THERE, LIKE, SOMEONE ELSE

OR A GIRL.

06:49.867 --> 06:53.495

ROOM AND THINK YOU ARE A GAY.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.043

12:22.950 --> 12:25.034
DON'T EVER CHANGE.

12:25.202 --> 12:26.494
LOOK, KELSO, ALL RIGHT,

12:26.662 --> 12:28.204
I'LL HELP YOU OUT
WITH JACKIE, MAN.

12:28.372 --> 12:31.791
I'LL TALK YOU THROUGH THE
WHOLE THING STEP BY STEP.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.543
THANKS, MAN.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.044
YOU KNOW, I GUESS
IT WAS WRONG...

12:35.212 --> 12:36.379
WHAT I DID
WITH LAURIE.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.506
BUT I WAS JUST AMUSING
MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

12:38.674 --> 12:40.300
AND THAT'S THE KEY
TO LIFE, RIGHT?

12:40.468 --> 12:45.263
NEVER STOP
AMUSING YOURSELF.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.516
UNLESS IT STARTS
TO CHAFE.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.895
THEN YOU SHOULD
TAKE A WEEK OFF.

12:52.062 --> 12:56.191
IT'S ALMOST TUESDAY, RIGHT?

12:58.277 --> 13:00.779
ERIC, I'M ASKING YOU,

13:00.946 --> 13:03.364
HAVE I BEEN
A BAD FATHER?

13:03.532 --> 13:07.160
MAYBE I'VE BEEN
TOO HARD ON HER.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.455
I MEAN,
FOR GOD'S SAKE,

13:10.623 --> 13:13.458
I THINK I'M
A FAIR MAN.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.836
RIGHT?

13:17.004 --> 13:19.839
ERIC, I'M TALKIN' TO YOU.

13:20.007 --> 13:22.634
DOES THIS NEED
MORE MAYONNAISE?

13:22.802 --> 13:24.010
GET OUTTA HERE!

13:24.178 --> 13:26.596
THANK YOU.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.848
BOY, KITTY, WE GOT A PAIR
TO BEAT A FULL HOUSE,

13:29.016 --> 13:30.433
THAT'S FOR SURE.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.602
WELL, RED, RELAX.
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.979
I'M OVERREACTING?!

13:35.147 --> 13:37.398
WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, KITTY,

13:37.566 --> 13:39.108
PEOPLE ARE GONNA TALK.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.236
HER LIVIN' WITH THAT GUY.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.530
RED, IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF PEOPLE TALK.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.573
LAURIE IS STILL
A PART OF THIS FAMILY,

13:45.741 --> 13:48.201
WHICH IS WHY I INVITED
HER TO DINNER TONIGHT.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.079
OH, NO, NO, NO, KITTY.
I'M NOT READY FOR THAT.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.997
OH, THAT'S SWEET...

13:53.165 --> 13:56.626
THE WAY YOU SAY THAT
LIKE YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

13:58.712 --> 13:59.879
LOOK, KITTY...

14:00.047 --> 14:02.382
SHE'S COMING.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.680
WELL, I'M GLAD
WE'RE ALL EATING

14:08.848 --> 14:10.390
DINNER TOGETHER
AS A FAMILY.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.975
YEAH, IT'S NICE,
ESPECIALLY SINCE

14:12.142 --> 14:14.727
LAURIE COULD MAKE IT
FROM ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN...

14:14.895 --> 14:16.563
WHERE SHE LIVES...

14:16.730 --> 14:19.607
WITH SOME GUY...

14:19.775 --> 14:22.151
IN SIN.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.404
ARE YOU EVER
GONNA HIT PUBERTY?

14:24.572 --> 14:27.490
OH. OW.
BUT YOU KNOW...

14:27.658 --> 14:32.495
WHAT'S REALLY SAD IS THAT YOU
GOT NO RESPECT FOR YOURSELF...

14:32.663 --> 14:34.455
OR THIS FAMILY.

14:34.623 --> 14:35.790
DADDY.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.918
WELL, HE'S NOT WRONG.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.295
BUT... BUT, DADDY...

14:40.462 --> 14:41.588
RED!

14:41.755 --> 14:44.299
WELL, KITTY,
WHO'S GONNA BUY THE COW

14:44.466 --> 14:47.385
WHEN THEY GET
THE MILK FOR FREE?

14:49.263 --> 14:52.098
[WHIMPERS]

14:53.309 --> 14:55.643
YOU KNOW, DAD, IT'S NOT
LIKE SHE'S HOOKING...

14:55.811 --> 14:58.771
OR SOME OTHER
BAD EXAMPLE.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.481
I MEAN, SHE'S JUST
LIVIN' WITH A GUY,

15:00.649 --> 15:02.984
AND IT IS THE
SEVENTIES NOW, RIGHT?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.944
WHAT ARE YOU
BABBLING ABOUT?

15:05.112 --> 15:10.033
WELL, MAYBE...

15:10.200 --> 15:12.535
MAYBE I JUST THINK YOU'RE
BEING A LITTLE HARD ON HER.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.455
WELL, THAT'S NICE, ERIC,
BUT RIGHT NOW I AM TOO ANGRY

15:15.623 --> 15:19.876
TO PRETEND TO GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK!

15:20.628 --> 15:25.381
THESE ARE GREAT POTATOES,
MRS. FORMAN.

15:25.549 --> 15:28.092
THANKS, ERIC.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.011
YEAH, SURE.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.263
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU BOYS
TAKE YOUR PLATES IN

15:32.431 --> 15:35.058
AND WATCH SOME
McMILLAN AND WIFE.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.310
YOU KNOW, JUST ONCE TODAY
I'D LIKE TO FINISH A MEAL

15:37.478 --> 15:40.188
WITHOUT GETTING CHASED
OUT OF THE ROOM.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.446
WELL, LAURIE, YOU
BETTER STOP YOUR LYING

15:48.614 --> 15:49.822
AND FACE UP TO THIS ONE.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.033
JUST LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE
DOING TO YOUR FATHER.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.576
MOM, I'M AN ADULT, OKAY?

15:53.744 --> 15:55.828
NO, NO, NO. AN ADULT
WOULD HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH

15:55.996 --> 15:57.747
AND NOT LIED ABOUT MOVING
IN WITH A GIRLFRIEND,

15:57.915 --> 16:00.833
WHICH I KNEW
WASN'T TRUE.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.418
WELL, MOM,
IF YOU ALREADY KNEW,

16:02.586 --> 16:04.879
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL DAD?!

16:05.047 --> 16:07.840
THEN WE WOULDN'T
BE IN THIS MESS!

16:08.008 --> 16:11.010
OH, GOOD GOD, ROSEMARY HAD
A BETTER BABY THAN ME.

16:17.434 --> 16:18.935
OKAY, YOU'VE BEEN
ACTING KIND OF WEIRD

16:19.103 --> 16:22.063
EVER SINCE LAURIE GAVE YOU
THAT T-SHIRT, MICHAEL.

16:22.815 --> 16:27.568
FIRST OFF,
ACT INNOCENT.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.572
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT, JACKIE.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.492
OF COURSE, SHE'LL
EXPLAIN HERSELF.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.577
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
HIDING SOMETHING.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.789
BUT YOU JUST STICK
TO YOUR ORIGINAL STORY.

16:39.957 --> 16:43.084
I'M STICKING TO
MY ORIGINAL STORY!

16:45.129 --> 16:47.880
NOW, SHE'LL
BE SKEPTICAL.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.091
UH-HUH...

16:50.259 --> 16:51.634
SO GO ON
THE OFFENSIVE.

16:51.802 --> 16:55.638
YOU KNOW, JACKIE, YOU'RE
JUST BEING PARANOID...

16:55.806 --> 16:57.140
AND THAT HURTS.

16:57.307 --> 17:01.811
BECAUSE YOU DON'T TRUST ME...
AND OTHER STUFF.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.397
AND THEN, SHE'LL BE
SO EMBARRASSED,

17:04.565 --> 17:06.607
SHE'LL CAVE AND
APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.360
FINE.
I BELIEVE YOU, MICHAEL.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.820
BUT KNOW THIS:

17:10.988 --> 17:14.073
IF YOU'RE NOT TELLING THE
TRUTH, I WILL FIND OUT,

17:14.241 --> 17:19.620
'CAUSE I'M SMART,
AND YOU... AREN'T.

17:20.581 --> 17:24.000
THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS FORGIVE HER.

17:28.255 --> 17:31.591
OKAY, JACKIE, I FORGIVE YOU.

17:41.268 --> 17:43.561
RED, I THINK YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE HARD ON LAURIE.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.313
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANYONE THINKS.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.983
WHAT SHE IS DOING
IS WRONG.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.443
NOW THAT I THINK BACK ON IT,

17:50.611 --> 17:52.278
I DON'T KNOW IF I EVER
KNEW THAT GIRL.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.614
LIVIN' WITH A GUY.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.950
OH, IS THAT A FOREIGN CAR?
AW, JEEZ.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.873
RED, YOU HAVE GONE
YOUR WHOLE LIFE

18:04.041 --> 18:05.708
THINKING SHE IS
JUST A LITTLE GIRL,

18:05.876 --> 18:09.545
BUT SHE IS AN ADULT NOW, AND
SHE IS NOT A PERFECT ONE.

18:09.713 --> 18:13.049
BOY, IS SHE NOT
A PERFECT ONE.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.342
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:14.510 --> 18:15.635
YOU HAVE TO LOVE
YOUR CHILDREN,

18:15.803 --> 18:17.220
EVEN WHEN THEY DO
THINGS YOU DON'T LIKE

18:17.387 --> 18:19.013
OR, BETTER YET,
HATE.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.932
YOU THINK
YOU DO A GOOD JOB,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.559
YOU THINK THAT YOU TEACH YOUR
CHILDREN THE DIFFERENCE

18:23.727 --> 18:24.435
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG,

18:24.603 --> 18:28.106
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU GET.
WELL, THE HELL WITH IT.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.691
OKAY, I GUESS WE DON'T
LOVE HER ANYMORE.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.528
LET'S TAKE ALL PICTURES
OF LAURIE OUT OF HERE

18:33.695 --> 18:35.071
AND PRETEND
SHE'S NOT OURS.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.364
AND IF WE SEE HER
ON THE STREET,

18:36.532 --> 18:37.573
LET'S IGNORE HER.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.952
NO, LET'S
THROW THINGS AT HER.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.829
WELL, NOW YOU'RE
JUST BEING STUPID.

18:42.996 --> 18:46.833
AND YOU'RE...
NOT BEING A GOOD FATHER.

18:52.673 --> 18:56.175
WELL...

18:56.343 --> 18:58.845
OKAY.

18:59.388 --> 19:03.850
MAYBE I HAVE BEEN
KIND OF A...

19:04.017 --> 19:07.478
A DUMB-ASS.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.647
I WAS GONNA SAY
UNREASONABLE.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.190
FINE. FINE.

19:11.358 --> 19:16.988
YOU'RE AN UNREASONABLE
DUMB-ASS.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.031
ARE YOU DONE NOW?

19:19.199 --> 19:21.909
I THINK I AM.

19:30.961 --> 19:34.297
AH, THE BRADYS WERE
SUCH A NICE FAMILY.

19:34.882 --> 19:38.718
I BET MR. BRADY NEVER
GREW TO HATE MARCIA.

19:39.428 --> 19:43.222
BUT THEN AGAIN,
MARCIA WASN'T SO WHORY.

19:45.058 --> 19:50.313
NO, SHE REALLY WASN'T.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.232
WHAT? NO. COME ON.
THIS IS OUR THING.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.692
YOU LOVE THIS.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.152
I'M MEAN TO YOU.
YOU'RE MEAN TO ME.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.196
SO, COME ON, HIT ME.

19:58.363 --> 20:02.783
SORRY. I CAN'T.
NOT TODAY.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.745
ERIC, YOU WERE
JUST LEAVING.

20:06.371 --> 20:07.747
DAD, I THINK MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE IT A LITTLE EASY ON...

20:07.915 --> 20:10.499
ERIC.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.753
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.508
LAURIE, I'VE BEEN
THINKING...

20:19.676 --> 20:23.679
ABOUT THE THING
THAT HAPPENED...

20:23.847 --> 20:27.391
AT THE PLACE
YOU LIVE.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.894
AND, UH, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I UNDERSTAND

20:30.062 --> 20:32.188
THAT YOU'RE NOT MY
LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.773
BUT I LIKE BEING
YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.108
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.736
YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.905
AND YOU'RE A GROWN-UP...

20:41.073 --> 20:49.038
WHO'S GOING TO DO AWFUL
AND STUPID THINGS...

20:49.206 --> 20:51.791
BUT I'LL
STILL LOVE YOU.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.418
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.213
AND I'M SORRY.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.508
SO, DADDY,
CAN I MOVE BACK IN?

21:01.051 --> 21:02.718
OH, YEAH.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.429
OKAY, GOOD. HEH HEH.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.807
YEAH, GREAT
TO HAVE YOU BACK.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.646
SO...

21:13.814 --> 21:16.524
YOUR MAN FRIEND KICKED
YOU OUT, DIDN'T HE?

21:16.692 --> 21:19.527
NO!

21:19.695 --> 21:22.571
HE MOVED BACK IN
WITH HIS WIFE.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.911
WELL, I JUST... I...
