01:20.521 --> 01:21.961
I'm Xiao Hong

01:23.321 --> 01:25.361
My real name is Zhang Naiying

01:26.601 --> 01:29.041
I was born on June 1st, 1911

01:29.441 --> 01:31.161
It was the day of the Dragon Boat Festival

01:31.681 --> 01:35.881
My family were land-owners
in Hulan County, Manchuria

01:37.521 --> 01:42.521
At 11 am on January 22nd, 1942...

01:43.161 --> 01:44.521
...I died

01:45.121 --> 01:49.041
I was in a makeshift hospital

01:49.041 --> 01:50.481
in Hong Kong

01:51.921 --> 01:55.281
I was thirty-one

01:58.201 --> 02:02.441
<i>"Blossoms appeared
in our back garden in May"</i>

02:02.961 --> 02:05.041
<i>"Then the fruits In June"</i>

02:05.321 --> 02:10.201
<i>"Cucumbers, eggplants,
corns, kidney beans..."</i>

02:10.520 --> 02:13.281
<i>"...watermelons, tomatoes..."</i>

02:13.801 --> 02:16.081
<i>"...and pumpkins with creeping vines"</i>

02:16.961 --> 02:20.441
<i>"But the mood in our place was desolate"</i>

02:21.361 --> 02:23.401
How old were you when your mother died?

02:26.921 --> 02:28.041
Eight

02:30.961 --> 02:33.921
I was only seven months when my mother died

02:35.881 --> 02:37.681
My father beat her

02:37.681 --> 02:39.121
So she took opium to die

02:40.721 --> 02:42.761
I heard that when she died,

02:42.761 --> 02:45.001
she was only 19 or 21

02:46.041 --> 02:47.841
I don't know what she looked like

02:47.841 --> 02:49.681
There were no pictures

02:50.921 --> 02:52.761
<i>"I'll probably never understand</i>

02:52.761 --> 02:54.441
<i>people like my father"</i>

02:54.961 --> 02:57.841
<i>"To servants, to his own children"</i>

02:57.841 --> 02:59.001
<i>"and to my grandfather. ..</i> ”

02:59.001 --> 03:01.961
<i>"...he was mean and aloof"</i>

03:08.201 --> 03:10.321
<i>"It was my grandfather who taught me that"</i>

03:11.081 --> 03:14.521
<i>"life includes love and warmth..."</i>

03:14.841 --> 03:18.081
<i>"...as well as coldness and hatred"</i>

03:29.081 --> 03:31.001
Hurry and grow up!

03:31.441 --> 03:34.721
Things will be fine when you're grown up

03:38.521 --> 03:42.241
<i>"I ran away from my father's house
when I was 20"</i>

03:42.241 --> 03:45.761
<i>"Ever since then, my life has drifted"</i>

03:46.041 --> 03:49.761
<i>"I've grown up, but things are not fine"</i>

03:50.201 --> 03:54.201
"ZHANG XIUKE Xiao Hong's brother"

03:54.201 --> 03:56.281
When my sister was
about to finish high school...

03:56.601 --> 03:58.881
...father arranged

03:59.841 --> 04:01.641
a marriage for her

04:02.081 --> 04:03.561
My sister resisted

04:03.561 --> 04:08.161
She was in love with our cousin, Lu Zheshun

04:08.681 --> 04:10.881
And he was already married

04:43.721 --> 04:45.401
<i>When they ran away to Peking together...</i>

04:46.001 --> 04:48.281
<i>...Lu Zheshun was pressured by his family</i>

04:48.761 --> 04:50.281
<i>and soon abandoned her</i>

04:54.281 --> 04:55.881
<i>My elopement</i>

04:55.881 --> 04:59.041
<i>made me notorious throughout the county</i>

04:59.481 --> 05:01.641
<i>Our family felt disgraced</i>

05:02.841 --> 05:05.961
<i>I got back from Peking
in the middle of the night</i>

05:06.361 --> 05:10.081
<i>My father responded by ordering
the whole household...</i>

05:10.521 --> 05:13.961
<i>...to move to our place in the countryside</i>

05:40.561 --> 05:42.961
Xiao Hong was locked up for ten months

05:42.961 --> 05:44.281
Then she fled to Harbin

05:44.281 --> 05:45.841
"SHU QUN Xiao Hong's friend, a writer"

05:46.521 --> 05:49.161
Later, Xiao Jun asked her many times
how she escaped

05:49.681 --> 05:51.081
She didn't answer

05:56.241 --> 05:58.801
<i>We know nothing at all...</i>

05:58.801 --> 06:01.081
<i>...about what happened to her in Harbin</i>

06:01.841 --> 06:04.641
<i>But her later writings show that
she was almost destitute</i>

06:05.321 --> 06:08.601
<i>Cut off from everyone she knew</i>

06:11.321 --> 06:12.521
<i>"In early winter..."</i>

06:13.601 --> 06:15.841
<i>"...while walking in the bracing cold..."</i>

06:16.081 --> 06:17.881
<i>"...I ran into my young brother"</i>

06:21.641 --> 06:23.481
<i>"The coffee-shop windows..."</i>

06:23.481 --> 06:26.521
<i>"...were frosted up"</i>

06:27.081 --> 06:31.201
<i>"I hung my coat
with its worn-out collar on a hanger"</i>

06:37.921 --> 06:39.561
You should come home

06:39.561 --> 06:40.921
It's so cold!

06:48.401 --> 06:50.121
You still play basketball at school?

06:51.721 --> 06:52.601
How's it going?

06:52.601 --> 06:53.801
You still like it?

06:54.121 --> 06:56.441
I'm better at it now

06:56.441 --> 06:59.561
I wish you still came to watch us

07:05.121 --> 07:08.001
Sister...come on home

07:08.561 --> 07:10.161
You look unhappy

07:10.161 --> 07:12.521
You'll get ill before long

07:15.001 --> 07:16.881
Why do you say I'm unhappy?

07:33.961 --> 07:35.801
Your hair's grown long

07:35.801 --> 07:37.601
You should get it cut

07:42.281 --> 07:44.041
Are you going to go on drifting?

07:45.081 --> 07:46.641
It's getting colder and colder

07:59.801 --> 08:03.281
<i>"My young brother's eyes are pitch black"</i>

08:17.401 --> 08:21.681
Since sister ran away, our family was ruined

08:22.001 --> 08:24.201
My father was fired by his Department

08:24.201 --> 08:26.081
...on the grounds that he'd brought up
his daughter badly

08:26.961 --> 08:29.241
I couldn't stand being mocked by my classmates

08:29.241 --> 08:31.001
So I changed school twice

08:31.401 --> 08:33.001
I ended up in Harbin Second High School

08:34.760 --> 08:36.601
That chance meeting with my sister...

08:37.001 --> 08:40.481
...became the subject
of her essay "<i>Early Winter</i>"

08:46.361 --> 08:48.641
She never saw our father again

08:49.681 --> 08:51.241
before she died

08:53.761 --> 08:55.801
<i>Not long after our meeting...</i>

08:56.481 --> 08:59.081
<i>...she rejoined the man
she was supposed to marry</i>

09:00.321 --> 09:01.761
<i>His name was Wang Enjia,</i>

09:02.001 --> 09:04.641
<i>a primary school teacher</i>

09:19.841 --> 09:20.841
Brother...

09:25.721 --> 09:27.201
Where's your dignity?

09:29.961 --> 09:31.601
You may not care, but your family does

09:32.961 --> 09:34.601
Why have you taken her back?

09:35.041 --> 09:37.761
This bitch all but ruined us!

09:37.841 --> 09:41.001
And you sit here, eating and drinking with her!

09:41.001 --> 09:42.441
Aren't you ashamed?

09:42.441 --> 09:44.921
Show some backbone!

10:23.841 --> 10:25.841
Come back, don't run!

10:41.201 --> 10:42.201
Welcome!

11:13.521 --> 11:14.921
You from one of the brothels?

11:17.841 --> 11:20.161
- Are you?
- Come on in!

11:20.161 --> 11:21.201
What is it?

11:21.481 --> 11:22.721
I'm coming

12:50.281 --> 12:51.361
<i>That summer evening,</i>

12:51.361 --> 12:54.081
<i>Wang Enjia walked out of her life</i>

12:54.401 --> 12:55.801
<i>He was never heard of again</i>

12:55.801 --> 12:56.481
"BAI LANG literary editor"

12:56.481 --> 12:58.401
They had moved into...

12:58.401 --> 13:00.441
...a swanky hotel in November 1931

13:00.441 --> 13:01.241
"LUO FENG writer"

13:01.241 --> 13:02.761
They stayed there for seven months,

13:02.761 --> 13:04.441
until they were broke

13:04.961 --> 13:06.601
They owed the hotel more than $400

13:07.921 --> 13:09.441
It was $600

13:10.441 --> 13:13.081
A huge sum at that time

13:14.961 --> 13:16.641
<i>Later, the hotel locked Xiao Hong...</i>

13:16.641 --> 13:18.361
<i>...in a storeroom</i>

13:19.001 --> 13:21.521
<i>She hoped that Wang would reappear</i>

13:22.041 --> 13:24.001
<i>She wrote...</i>

13:26.041 --> 13:27.521
<i>"In May last year</i>

13:27.521 --> 13:30.481
<i>I tasted green apricot"</i>

13:31.401 --> 13:34.401
<i>"In May this year,
the misery of my life..."</i>

13:34.401 --> 13:37.361
<i>"...tastes like that green apricot"</i>

13:40.241 --> 13:42.841
<i>But Wang Enjia never did come back</i>

13:43.681 --> 13:48.161
<i>Stranger yet, the whole Wang family
disappeared too</i>

13:48.521 --> 13:52.001
<i>Yet another unsolved mystery
in the life of Xiao Hong</i>

14:03.161 --> 14:04.881
Excuse me, are you Zhang Naiying?

14:09.681 --> 14:11.721
I'm the editor
of <i>International Gazette</i>, Lao Fei

14:12.281 --> 14:13.841
He writes for us

14:15.161 --> 14:17.401
We received your letter

14:21.721 --> 14:24.921
In her letter, she said
if she couldn't pay the bill...

14:25.041 --> 14:27.161
...the hotel owner was going
to sell her to a brothel...

14:27.161 --> 14:28.521
...in lieu of payment

14:30.721 --> 14:32.201
It turned out to be true

14:32.361 --> 14:34.361
The woman has guts

14:34.681 --> 14:36.401
It was smart of her to write to us

14:36.721 --> 14:38.681
We must help her!

14:38.681 --> 14:39.801
Really help

14:40.241 --> 14:41.401
Damn it!

14:41.841 --> 14:43.281
I'm a woman too

14:44.001 --> 14:45.401
And the money?

14:45.961 --> 14:47.561
Where do we find that much cash?

14:48.161 --> 14:49.201
If we pooled all we have...

14:49.201 --> 14:50.841
...it wouldn't come to $600

14:51.201 --> 14:52.681
We could publish her letter

14:52.681 --> 14:54.001
Appeal for assistance

14:55.081 --> 14:57.121
You think anyone would donate a cent?

14:59.761 --> 15:01.641
San Lang hasn't said a word all evening

15:03.081 --> 15:04.641
I have nothing...

15:05.361 --> 15:07.721
Except the hair I can't afford
to cut these past few months

15:09.001 --> 15:10.281
If I could turn my hair into cash...

15:10.281 --> 15:11.961
...I would go bald

15:12.561 --> 15:14.681
San Lang is drunk

15:16.881 --> 15:18.561
Write something and sell it!

15:18.561 --> 15:20.801
The only ones who'd buy my stuff are ghosts!

15:21.321 --> 15:23.361
I can't write stuff that sells

15:35.721 --> 15:39.921
The evening of July 13th, 1932...

15:41.361 --> 15:43.641
Xiao Jun and Xiao Hong
were destined to meet.

15:44.241 --> 15:46.561
Xiao Jun mentioned that first meeting twice

15:46.561 --> 15:48.961
in his writings

15:51.801 --> 15:56.361
<i>"Her pale, round face was framed"</i>

15:56.761 --> 15:59.041
<i>"by long, straggly hair"</i>

15:59.801 --> 16:02.881
<i>"She seemed nervous"</i>

16:03.201 --> 16:05.561
<i>"and her voice</i>

16:05.801 --> 16:08.281
<i>sounded frightened"</i>

16:15.001 --> 16:16.241
A letter for you

16:41.121 --> 16:43.681
So you're Mr San Lang
(better known as "Xiao Jun")

16:45.961 --> 16:50.401
I'm reading one of your articles

16:50.961 --> 16:52.361
Haven't finished it yet

16:52.521 --> 16:54.041
This one... <i>The Orphaned Child</i>

16:55.281 --> 16:56.921
I like it

17:00.441 --> 17:02.681
Here are the books you wanted

17:02.921 --> 17:04.361
Lao Fei asked me to bring them

17:07.001 --> 17:08.601
I'll be going

17:11.521 --> 17:12.921
Can we talk?

17:14.001 --> 17:15.080
All right?

17:20.681 --> 17:21.800
Let's talk

17:45.961 --> 17:47.641
Who drew this?

17:51.761 --> 17:53.441
I did it in an idle moment

18:00.041 --> 18:01.641
And the calligraphy?

18:02.121 --> 18:03.321
Yes

18:04.601 --> 18:06.121
You copied a master?

18:08.881 --> 18:11.001
We did it in class

18:21.441 --> 18:22.761
And the poem?

18:24.641 --> 18:25.881
I wrote it

18:28.281 --> 18:32.801
<i>"At that moment,
I felt the world was changing”</i>

18:33.481 --> 18:35.281
<i>"The season was changing"</i>

18:36.001 --> 18:37.641
<i>"People were changing"</i>

18:39.401 --> 18:44.401
<i>"My thoughts and feelings were changing too"</i>

18:45.721 --> 18:47.721
<i>"Right in front of me"</i>

18:48.201 --> 18:52.361
<i>"was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever known"</i>

19:06.721 --> 19:10.081
What's your philosophy of love?

19:11.681 --> 19:13.041
What philosophy?

19:13.521 --> 19:14.481
Either you love...

19:14.481 --> 19:15.761
...or you ditch the whole business

19:16.201 --> 19:17.641
What if you can't do that?

19:18.041 --> 19:21.801
Then you're stuck with it

19:23.201 --> 19:25.361
I've grown quite fond
of a girl who lives downstairs

19:25.961 --> 19:27.721
When she gives me a smile...

19:27.721 --> 19:29.521
...I feel I'm the happiest guy in the world

19:41.681 --> 19:43.241
What do people live for?

19:50.801 --> 19:53.161
Why do you live?

19:53.521 --> 19:56.201
You have plenty of reasons to kill yourself now

19:57.721 --> 19:58.881
Me?

20:05.121 --> 20:06.801
Because there's something in this world...

20:07.281 --> 20:11.081
Some mystery that I cling to...

20:12.081 --> 20:15.321
That's why I go on living

20:20.641 --> 20:21.841
Me too

20:24.601 --> 20:27.921
<i>"We had too much to say"</i>

20:28.641 --> 20:33.801
<i>"I was ready to go several times..."</i>

20:34.681 --> 20:39.601
<i>"But I stayed"</i>

20:56.361 --> 20:57.841
Buy something to eat

21:11.201 --> 21:14.801
That money was his bus fare!

21:15.041 --> 21:17.921
That night, Xiao Jun had to walk
ten miles to get home

21:19.241 --> 21:20.121
And next day,

21:20.121 --> 21:22.481
he went to the hotel again

22:15.081 --> 22:16.241
Why?

22:17.921 --> 22:19.961
Why do I have no strength

22:22.201 --> 22:24.161
I can hardly open my eyes

22:24.961 --> 22:26.601
Why is that?

22:29.121 --> 22:30.641
Love does that to you

23:00.681 --> 23:02.121
The power of love may be great...

23:02.121 --> 23:03.841
But not greater than $600

23:04.721 --> 23:07.121
Xiao Jun and the rest of us were useless

23:07.801 --> 23:09.881
We couldn't raise the money to save Xiao Hong

23:11.481 --> 23:13.441
Xiao Jun tried everything

23:13.441 --> 23:15.441
We were at a complete loss...

23:15.561 --> 23:17.441
...when Harbin was suddenly flooded

23:37.961 --> 23:39.121
Uncle!

23:40.081 --> 23:41.721
Uncle! Uncle boatman!

23:41.721 --> 23:42.401
Here!

23:42.401 --> 23:43.361
I'm here!

23:45.641 --> 23:46.801
Uncle,

23:47.841 --> 23:49.721
I'm pregnant

23:50.041 --> 23:51.601
I'll give birth soon!

23:52.001 --> 23:53.361
Help me!

24:35.241 --> 24:36.401
Turn the boat around

24:54.721 --> 24:56.561
The baby for Bed 2

25:04.081 --> 25:07.041
It's a boy

25:07.041 --> 25:08.401
Your family will be happy!

25:09.281 --> 25:10.601
The baby for you

25:10.601 --> 25:11.641
No!

25:19.921 --> 25:21.921
<i>Xiao Hong had the baby adopted</i>

25:22.921 --> 25:24.721
<i>Nobody knew the details</i>

25:25.761 --> 25:28.441
<i>A year later she wrote</i> The Foundling,

25:29.081 --> 25:30.601
<i>which told us how she felt</i>

25:35.161 --> 25:36.401
Your belly still hurts?

25:51.761 --> 25:52.841
Come along!

25:56.881 --> 25:57.881
Come on!

25:57.881 --> 25:58.921
Watch your step!

26:00.201 --> 26:02.321
Over here, you two

26:02.321 --> 26:03.401
I'm coming

26:03.401 --> 26:04.561
Sign here?

26:06.601 --> 26:07.761
Sit down

26:19.521 --> 26:20.561
All right?

26:20.561 --> 26:21.601
Yes

26:32.081 --> 26:33.321
Take it slowly

26:33.321 --> 26:34.521
It's slippery

26:36.801 --> 26:38.561
I'm all right

27:07.961 --> 27:09.321
Nothing to drink from...

27:40.921 --> 27:42.121
You want the bedding?

27:42.121 --> 27:43.121
Yes

27:43.361 --> 27:44.681
Fifty cents per day

27:44.681 --> 27:45.881
Then never mind

27:57.801 --> 27:59.161
Stingy bastards!

29:11.081 --> 29:11.961
Hungry?

29:11.961 --> 29:12.961
No

29:13.161 --> 29:14.241
Your belly still hurts?

29:15.001 --> 29:15.881
No

29:18.961 --> 29:20.121
It's freezing outside?

29:20.641 --> 29:22.001
Cold and hard

29:29.961 --> 29:31.041
Eat

31:04.561 --> 31:05.641
You're back

31:07.321 --> 31:08.441
What's that?

31:08.441 --> 31:09.761
I redeemed the clothes

31:09.761 --> 31:11.201
we pawned

31:14.081 --> 31:15.521
Put this on

31:15.521 --> 31:16.721
I'll wear the sweater

31:35.961 --> 31:37.081
Where did you get the money?

31:37.521 --> 31:38.601
Stole it!

31:41.161 --> 31:42.721
I got a job as a tutor

31:43.161 --> 31:44.281
Really?

31:58.681 --> 31:59.961
It's a good place

32:00.641 --> 32:03.041
The rickshaw pullers all eat here

32:13.201 --> 32:14.321
Excuse me...

32:14.321 --> 32:15.481
Come...

32:49.161 --> 32:50.201
Taste good?

32:50.641 --> 32:51.761
I haven't started

32:58.401 --> 32:59.961
- You want meat?
- Yes

33:04.401 --> 33:05.401
Boss...

33:05.401 --> 33:07.161
Five cents-worth of pork

33:07.161 --> 33:08.361
OK

33:08.361 --> 33:09.641
- Which part do you want?
- This

33:09.641 --> 33:10.641
And this

33:21.041 --> 33:22.321
- Thank you
- Here you are

33:23.881 --> 33:24.881
Pig's head meat!

33:28.361 --> 33:29.401
Look!

33:30.001 --> 33:31.201
Try it?

33:31.201 --> 33:32.561
Nothing special

33:36.641 --> 33:37.921
Look!

33:40.241 --> 33:41.361
We have plenty already

33:41.361 --> 33:42.761
We don't need meatballs

33:43.881 --> 33:45.241
It's meatballs in soup

33:47.641 --> 33:49.561
We'll have one bowl

33:49.561 --> 33:50.601
Okay

33:59.481 --> 34:00.881
It's hot!

34:00.921 --> 34:02.961
It's very good!

34:08.081 --> 34:09.321
We should have a drink with this

34:10.601 --> 34:11.841
I'll keep you company

34:38.001 --> 34:39.440
My shoelace broke!

35:29.201 --> 35:32.201
<i>"Electric lights ablaze in the packed city"</i>

35:32.201 --> 35:35.201
<i>"With cash in our pockets,"</i>

35:35.201 --> 35:38.841
<i>"the two of us stride boldly down the street"</i>

35:43.561 --> 35:44.641
Madam Xu!

35:46.601 --> 35:48.641
I'm reading Xiao Hong's <i>Market Street</i>

35:56.521 --> 35:59.001
She writes so well about cold and hunger

35:59.641 --> 36:02.561
We all know about poverty these days...

36:03.481 --> 36:06.321
But no-one writes about it better than she does

36:21.841 --> 36:23.441
Keep your arm and leg straight

36:23.641 --> 36:24.801
Straight!

36:28.681 --> 36:30.041
You're too padded!

36:52.321 --> 36:53.361
Point!

36:54.961 --> 36:57.401
Use your wrist

36:57.601 --> 36:58.641
Good

37:03.601 --> 37:04.841
And back

37:05.841 --> 37:06.801
And back

37:08.721 --> 37:09.681
Thrust!

37:11.201 --> 37:13.001
Swing!

37:26.641 --> 37:28.081
Roasting your legs?

37:39.761 --> 37:40.921
Let's eat!

37:59.121 --> 38:00.121
This is Lao Huang

38:00.121 --> 38:01.081
Zhang Naiying

38:01.081 --> 38:02.961
Come on in

38:04.481 --> 38:06.441
San Lang's here

38:09.721 --> 38:10.841
Zhang Naiying

38:13.881 --> 38:15.281
This is my wife

38:16.401 --> 38:17.161
San Lang

38:17.161 --> 38:18.161
Sit down

38:26.841 --> 38:29.321
Saline betrays Our Lord...

38:29.441 --> 38:31.481
...by following the Communist path!

38:32.241 --> 38:34.161
I will reclaim her for Our Lord

38:34.721 --> 38:37.961
Lord, please grant me the strength...

38:38.241 --> 38:39.401
Amen

38:40.881 --> 38:42.281
Saline

38:43.281 --> 38:44.721
Saline

38:48.801 --> 38:51.961
you are so kind...

38:52.561 --> 38:54.521
Saline...

38:55.681 --> 38:57.841
Saline...

38:58.841 --> 38:59.841
Auntie...

39:02.201 --> 39:03.561
In our family,

39:05.281 --> 39:13.201
the second miss
and the eldest son are both kind

39:14.081 --> 39:18.681
But the elder sister's children

39:19.401 --> 39:21.361
are annoying

39:23.001 --> 39:24.401
Auntie...

39:31.961 --> 39:32.881
Bai Lang!

39:33.521 --> 39:37.081
I warn you, if you keep on giggling,
I'll punish you!

39:37.801 --> 39:39.281
You too, Jin

39:39.481 --> 39:40.521
I won't laugh

39:40.521 --> 39:41.641
I won't look

39:42.401 --> 39:44.001
You shouldn't be laughing either!

39:44.441 --> 39:45.841
Try it again

39:45.841 --> 39:47.201
No more laughter!

39:50.921 --> 39:52.281
Auntie...

39:53.321 --> 39:55.401
Your fever is raging...

39:59.441 --> 40:01.481
Listen, stop laughing!

40:01.481 --> 40:02.561
Be serious!

40:25.521 --> 40:26.961
Happy New Year!

40:27.481 --> 40:29.601
Happy New Year!

40:30.481 --> 40:32.641
Later, our life improved a great deal

40:34.161 --> 40:36.881
We even hired a Russian tutor

40:36.881 --> 40:38.681
Xiao Jun started learning how to drive

40:41.721 --> 40:43.881
One day he came back and said

40:44.201 --> 40:45.961
he'd made a new friend

40:46.201 --> 40:49.761
A high school student from Shanghai

40:51.041 --> 40:52.281
Her name was Cheng

41:05.881 --> 41:08.641
<i>Miss Cheng came by very often</i>

41:08.961 --> 41:11.161
<i>Xiao Jun borrowed skates</i>

41:11.161 --> 41:12.761
<i>so that we could go skating together</i>

41:13.721 --> 41:17.721
<i>New friends...well,
we got closer day by day</i>

41:18.601 --> 41:21.281
<i>But she got closer to Xiao Jun</i>

41:30.241 --> 41:31.921
<i>She began to write to him</i>

41:32.801 --> 41:36.761
<i>They met often, but still needed to write
to each other</i>

41:53.521 --> 41:54.641
San Lang...

41:58.721 --> 41:59.921
San Lang...

42:04.041 --> 42:05.881
Was it true, what you said?

42:07.121 --> 42:08.601
That day at the hotel

42:08.601 --> 42:10.601
That if you hadn't seen my writing
and drawings,

42:11.001 --> 42:13.801
we wouldn't be together now?

42:17.081 --> 42:18.481
What do you mean?

42:20.281 --> 42:21.441
Was it true?

42:23.361 --> 42:24.481
As I said...

42:24.841 --> 42:26.401
I love you for your talents

42:37.521 --> 42:40.361
And if I had no talents, what then?

43:28.001 --> 43:30.001
"The Orphan"

43:47.241 --> 43:50.721
<i>After a While, though,
Miss Cheng stopped coming</i>

43:51.201 --> 43:52.761
<i>Maybe she was afraid of me</i>

43:54.081 --> 43:55.921
<i>The final time she came...</i>

44:18.481 --> 44:19.841
Xiao Jun is out

44:23.201 --> 44:24.721
I've come to say goodbye

44:25.081 --> 44:26.481
I'm going back to the south

44:32.161 --> 44:33.361
This is my boyfriend

44:33.681 --> 44:34.761
Hello

44:35.481 --> 44:37.241
I'll tell San Lang when he gets back

44:37.601 --> 44:38.921
He will see you off

44:40.521 --> 44:41.561
Good

44:42.721 --> 44:44.001
I'll be off, then

45:56.801 --> 45:58.561
That spring,

45:58.881 --> 46:00.921
Shu Qun lost contact with the Communist Party

46:00.921 --> 46:02.241
He was in danger

46:03.121 --> 46:05.521
He left Harbin in a hurry, for Qingdao

46:07.001 --> 46:08.561
And once he'd gone,

46:11.121 --> 46:13.001
there were consequences

46:30.441 --> 46:32.121
Are you Miss Bai Lang?

46:32.121 --> 46:33.041
Yes, and you are...?

46:33.041 --> 46:34.521
You are Luo Feng?

46:37.481 --> 46:39.961
Please come with us to the Bureau

47:05.641 --> 47:06.801
Bread, please

47:35.361 --> 47:36.321
We can go

47:36.761 --> 47:39.041
3.5 cents for the bread and sausages

47:41.321 --> 47:42.441
Sausages?

47:43.681 --> 47:44.961
I didn't ask for sausages!

47:45.081 --> 47:46.121
Don't blame me

47:46.121 --> 47:47.961
I didn't ask you to buy anything

47:49.401 --> 47:50.441
Hey, kid

48:00.841 --> 48:02.761
The Bureau isn't stupid

48:03.081 --> 48:04.481
They see that

48:04.721 --> 48:07.881
Luo Feng is mocking
the "Manchukuo Day" celebrations

48:08.401 --> 48:11.601
They're sure to hold Bai Lang responsible too

48:12.761 --> 48:15.121
You need to take care, Jin

48:16.001 --> 48:16.921
Oh yes...

48:18.001 --> 48:20.281
San Lang is at risk too

48:21.361 --> 48:23.641
For non-Party members,

48:23.641 --> 48:25.201
he and Xiao Hong are too conspicuous

48:26.161 --> 48:28.361
They don't even know that we're Party activists

48:29.001 --> 48:30.801
I've asked permission for them

48:30.801 --> 48:32.281
to be evacuated right away

49:03.961 --> 49:05.921
Let's go

49:37.241 --> 49:38.801
We saw the couple off

49:39.441 --> 49:41.441
They left Harbin for Qingdao

49:42.161 --> 49:43.761
A week after they left,

49:45.161 --> 49:46.761
Luo Feng was arrested again

49:48.881 --> 49:50.921
Two years later, Jin was killed

49:51.201 --> 49:53.161
by the Japanese

49:54.041 --> 49:55.361
Lao Huang disappeared

49:56.081 --> 49:57.561
We never saw him again

49:58.721 --> 50:02.841
I ran around trying to save Luo Feng

50:48.721 --> 50:49.801
<i>"In the village..."</i>

50:49.801 --> 50:53.161
<i>"...men and beasts were occupied
in the business of living...and dying”</i>

50:53.841 --> 50:56.241
<i>"The cycle of life and death there
went on..."</i>

50:56.241 --> 50:58.121
<i>"...exactly as it had ten years earlier"</i>

50:58.761 --> 51:02.281
<i>"The same number
of sparrows congregated on rooftops"</i>

51:02.481 --> 51:04.481
<i>"The sun was just as warm"</i>

51:04.641 --> 51:07.201
<i>"Nothing had changed in ten years"</i>

51:07.961 --> 51:10.681
<i>"Ping and Lnock-Knee were adults!"</i>

51:11.001 --> 51:14.481
<i>"Aunt Wang stood, with flying hair"</i>

51:14.761 --> 51:18.521
<i>"Outside her plot listening to songs
from the mountain"</i>

51:18.881 --> 51:21.961
<i>"Flags which the villagers
never saw in cold weather”</i>

51:21.961 --> 51:24.881
<i>"Flew up, fluttering skywards"</i>

51:25.241 --> 51:29.281
<i>Xiao Jun, I have received your letter</i>

51:29.881 --> 51:32.281
<i>I shall answer your two questions</i>

51:32.721 --> 51:36.201
<i>First, don't ask what we writers want now</i>

51:36.761 --> 51:38.881
<i>Ask instead what you can do</i>

51:43.201 --> 51:45.161
We never expected

51:45.801 --> 51:49.681
Lu Xun to answer our letter

51:50.961 --> 51:52.961
Nor that he'd answer so quickly

51:55.281 --> 51:59.041
When I finished <i>The Field of Life and Death,</i>
I was at a loss

52:00.161 --> 52:02.161
I had no idea how to get it published

52:05.361 --> 52:10.521
I hadn't moved in literary circles

52:16.761 --> 52:18.841
After Lu Xun's reply arrived...

52:19.241 --> 52:24.161
...Shu Qun and his new bride
were arrested by the Kuomintang

52:24.641 --> 52:26.601
Then the wife's whole family was arrested too

52:27.561 --> 52:30.081
We made a hasty escape from Qingdao

53:13.881 --> 53:16.761
<i>The political situation in Shanghai is grim</i>

53:17.161 --> 53:18.961
<i>The Kuomintang is in charge everywhere</i>

53:19.121 --> 53:20.801
<i>except the foreign concessions</i>

53:21.241 --> 53:23.041
<i>In tandem with the suppression</i>

53:23.041 --> 53:24.841
<i>of the Communists...</i>

53:25.121 --> 53:28.841
...the government targets cultural activities

53:29.201 --> 53:31.881
Lu Xun has been in hiding for four years

53:31.881 --> 53:33.721
He lives a semi-clandestine life

53:34.401 --> 53:36.561
There are literary groups,

53:36.561 --> 53:39.041
with different political orientations

53:39.041 --> 53:41.921
The debates between them are bitter

53:42.801 --> 53:46.161
As the most prominent writer in China,
Lu Xun stands...

53:46.161 --> 53:48.841
...attacked...

53:48.841 --> 53:50.321
...from all sides

53:50.321 --> 53:54.161
"NIE GANNU poet & essayist"

53:54.161 --> 53:55.361
In his seventh letter...

53:55.361 --> 53:58.121
...to Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun...

53:58.121 --> 54:01.241
...Lu Xun invited them to a meeting

54:59.201 --> 55:00.921
You are Mr Xiao Jun?

55:02.601 --> 55:03.641
Yes

55:05.881 --> 55:07.361
Then let's move, shall we?

55:18.441 --> 55:22.241
This café is mainly patronized by clients
from the ballroom nearby

55:23.281 --> 55:25.401
It's quiet in the daytimes

55:25.681 --> 55:27.361
Very few Chinese

55:28.401 --> 55:30.721
So I tend to meet friends here

55:33.001 --> 55:35.041
How are you doing these days?

55:35.041 --> 55:36.841
Thank you, Mr Lu Xun

55:36.841 --> 55:37.881
Thanks

55:40.641 --> 55:41.681
Thanks

55:46.601 --> 55:47.841
Help yourselves

55:50.321 --> 55:52.041
Is Madam Xu coming?

55:53.361 --> 55:54.721
They're on their way

56:00.001 --> 56:01.201
Daddy!

56:05.681 --> 56:06.881
Daddy!

56:08.521 --> 56:09.681
Let me introduce you

56:09.681 --> 56:11.761
Mr Xiao Jun

56:11.761 --> 56:13.121
Miss Xiao Hong

56:13.361 --> 56:14.441
This is Madam Xu

56:14.441 --> 56:15.721
Hello

56:17.561 --> 56:18.601
Do sit down

56:21.641 --> 56:23.601
You look pretty!

56:25.641 --> 56:26.921
What did he say?

56:27.321 --> 56:28.681
He says you're pretty

56:29.441 --> 56:30.241
Thank you!

56:30.241 --> 56:31.561
What's your name?

56:36.801 --> 56:38.121
He's called Haiying

56:38.681 --> 56:40.481
But he thinks the "ying" is too feminine,

56:40.481 --> 56:42.081
so he doesn't like it

56:43.081 --> 56:45.201
He'll change it when he grows up

56:50.081 --> 56:53.441
It's sometimes interesting to observe a child

56:54.521 --> 56:57.361
But to raise one entails
giving up all your own time

56:58.161 --> 56:59.881
It's troublesome

57:03.921 --> 57:05.401
Hey...

57:05.881 --> 57:08.081
You should answer the question

57:08.081 --> 57:10.161
Xiao Hong posed in her letter

57:12.761 --> 57:14.361
Do I look like a loose woman?

57:19.321 --> 57:21.481
I told you it was just a rumor!

57:24.241 --> 57:28.081
I'm always surprised by the kind of rumors

57:29.521 --> 57:32.361
they spread about me

57:32.641 --> 57:36.081
Most are made up by so-called writers

57:37.081 --> 57:38.681
Do they hate me so much?

57:39.241 --> 57:41.961
Most just differ on approaches to writing

57:42.481 --> 57:44.801
I don't socialize with them

57:45.721 --> 57:48.281
They're basically just amusing themselves

57:51.561 --> 57:53.961
I can see that we've overrated
the writers in Shanghai

57:55.721 --> 57:58.041
We've come from the far north

57:58.681 --> 58:01.281
We've been longing
to come to this cultural center

58:01.681 --> 58:03.201
We thought leftist writers

58:03.201 --> 58:05.281
were exemplary fighters

58:06.081 --> 58:10.041
I think writers tend to have a character flaw

58:10.921 --> 58:14.321
Their lines of thought are not too steady

58:15.041 --> 58:19.161
Sometimes they bend to the east,
sometimes to the west

58:19.921 --> 58:22.681
Few of them have firm convictions

58:24.161 --> 58:25.521
When the left prospered...

58:25.521 --> 58:28.881
...they rushed to join what seemed
a fashionable cause

58:29.481 --> 58:31.601
Then, when the persecutions began,

58:31.601 --> 58:34.361
they changed direction

58:35.401 --> 58:37.401
Some even betrayed their friends,

58:37.641 --> 58:39.801
handing them over to the other side

58:40.521 --> 58:42.801
It happens in other countries too

58:43.561 --> 58:45.761
But I think it's endemic in China

58:46.801 --> 58:48.481
It's really a bad thing

58:52.001 --> 58:53.921
How is Ding Ling doing since they seized her?

58:54.401 --> 58:56.721
She's still under house arrest in Nanking

58:57.681 --> 58:59.601
We are not sure about the rest

59:07.561 --> 59:09.561
Here you are...

59:14.641 --> 59:17.681
Small change for the tram

59:28.401 --> 59:29.841
Give me the manuscript

59:30.841 --> 59:32.121
Haiying!

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:18.201
Xiao Hong! Xiao Hong!

01:00:23.881 --> 01:00:25.041
Madam Xu!

01:00:27.481 --> 01:00:28.721
It's terribly cold today

01:00:28.721 --> 01:00:29.521
It's all right

01:00:29.521 --> 01:00:31.201
Lu Xun is waiting for you

01:00:31.201 --> 01:00:32.681
Welcome, please come in

01:00:40.441 --> 01:00:42.041
Let me introduce you

01:00:42.761 --> 01:00:44.761
You can talk freely in front of these people

01:00:46.121 --> 01:00:50.401
This gentleman is our "boss"

01:00:51.641 --> 01:00:52.801
Good to meet you

01:00:53.401 --> 01:00:54.561
Mr Nie...

01:00:55.201 --> 01:00:57.401
His wife Miss Zhou...

01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:03.241
And this couple are Mr Xiao Jun
and Miss Xiao Hong

01:01:05.961 --> 01:01:07.681
They've recently arrived from Manchuria

01:01:09.641 --> 01:01:13.761
We're supposed to be celebrating
the birth of Mr Hu's son,

01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:16.401
but he's absent. Maybe the invitation
didn't reach them

01:01:17.881 --> 01:01:21.561
Shanghai has its deficiencies

01:01:25.121 --> 01:01:26.921
Move round a little

01:01:27.041 --> 01:01:28.481
Make yourselves comfortable

01:01:32.201 --> 01:01:32.921
"HU FENG literary critic"

01:01:32.921 --> 01:01:34.881
Mr Lu Xun's invitation was delivered

01:01:34.881 --> 01:01:36.481
the day after the party

01:01:36.481 --> 01:01:37.081
"MEI ZHI writer"

01:01:37.081 --> 01:01:38.721
That's...

01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:39.961
...why we weren't there

01:01:39.961 --> 01:01:41.721
I'm sorry they waited

01:01:42.641 --> 01:01:45.961
Lu Xun later gave me Xiao Jun's address,

01:01:45.961 --> 01:01:47.641
and asked me to contact them directly

01:01:49.921 --> 01:01:51.241
<i>After that dinner,</i>

01:01:51.481 --> 01:01:54.801
<i>Lu Xun wrote to the Xiaos, saying...</i>

01:01:56.121 --> 01:01:58.761
<i>"The enemy is nothing"</i>

01:01:59.681 --> 01:02:03.441
<i>”Much more terrible are the pests
in our own camp”</i>

01:02:04.401 --> 01:02:06.681
<i>"They're the ones who cause disasters"</i>

01:02:07.441 --> 01:02:11.921
<i>"Sometimes I feel lonely, even distraught"</i>

01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:19.161
<i>"Still, I just do what I can"</i>

01:02:20.321 --> 01:02:23.081
<i>"Even if I'm on the verge of despair"</i>

01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:43.281
Coming!

01:02:51.921 --> 01:02:53.001
Please come in

01:02:55.201 --> 01:02:56.401
Madam Xu...

01:03:02.241 --> 01:03:04.601
<i>"The first time we visited Lu Xun's home"</i>

01:03:05.441 --> 01:03:10.681
<i>"was in winter, towards dusk"</i>

01:03:10.681 --> 01:03:14.601
<i>”It was a little dark
in the downstairs room"</i>

01:03:26.561 --> 01:03:29.161
<i>"Mr Lu Xun had two kinds of cigarettes,"</i>

01:03:29.361 --> 01:03:32.761
<i>"one expensive and one cheap"</i>

01:03:33.161 --> 01:03:35.321
<i>"The cheap ones came in a green canister,"</i>

01:03:35.321 --> 01:03:38.041
<i>"and Lu Xun smoked those himself"</i>

01:03:38.201 --> 01:03:40.281
<i>"The others were in a white canister,”</i>

01:03:40.441 --> 01:03:43.321
<i>"served to guests"</i>

01:03:57.241 --> 01:03:58.241
Help yourself!

01:04:00.761 --> 01:04:02.481
I have enough

01:04:03.721 --> 01:04:05.321
You drink

01:04:05.321 --> 01:04:07.001
Enough for me

01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:10.401
Help yourself

01:04:10.921 --> 01:04:12.041
Enough

01:04:15.241 --> 01:04:17.801
Both of us raise a glass
to you on our first visit

01:04:17.801 --> 01:04:18.961
Thank you

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:21.001
Thanks for your dinner

01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:23.241
He's very happy that you came

01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:26.001
- You drink for me
- I'll drink for him

01:04:26.681 --> 01:04:27.881
You're always welcome

01:04:29.801 --> 01:04:30.921
Bottoms up

01:05:08.681 --> 01:05:13.201
<i>"In Mr Lu Xun's parlor, there's a pot-plant"</i>

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:17.401
<i>"When I first saw it, I asked..."</i>

01:05:19.241 --> 01:05:20.681
What is this?

01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:22.361
It's an evergreen

01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:24.321
An evergreen?

01:05:24.441 --> 01:05:25.401
Yes

01:05:25.801 --> 01:05:27.041
It will always look like that

01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:55.081
<i>"That evening,
we chatted from 9pm to 10pm..."</i>

01:05:55.081 --> 01:05:57.001
<i>"...and then until 11pm"</i>

01:05:57.761 --> 01:06:02.121
<i>"We wanted to go,
so that Mr Lu Xun could rest"</i>

01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:05.281
<i>"We could see that he was not
in the best of health"</i>

01:06:05.721 --> 01:06:10.001
<i>"Madam Xu fold us he'd had a cold
for more than a month"</i>

01:06:10.001 --> 01:06:11.321
<i>"He'd only just got over it"</i>

01:06:12.881 --> 01:06:16.361
<i>"But Mr Lu Xun didn't seem tired"</i>

01:06:20.361 --> 01:06:23.521
<i>"After 11 o'clock, it began to rain"</i>

01:06:24.201 --> 01:06:27.481
<i>"The rain pattered on the windowpanes"</i>

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:49.241
<i>"It was late, it was raining..."</i>

01:06:49.681 --> 01:06:54.041
<i>"We felt uneasy
and kept getting up to leave”</i>

01:06:54.361 --> 01:06:58.601
<i>"But Mr Lu Xun and Madam Xu insisted
that We stay longer"</i>

01:07:00.561 --> 01:07:04.361
<i>"The trams run until midnight"</i>

01:07:05.161 --> 01:07:09.561
<i>"And so it was nearly 12"</i>

01:07:10.201 --> 01:07:13.041
<i>"before we went outside"</i>

01:07:15.561 --> 01:07:16.521
Mr Xiao Jun...

01:07:16.521 --> 01:07:17.281
Sir

01:07:17.281 --> 01:07:20.481
Next time you come...remember this plate

01:07:21.561 --> 01:07:24.281
My house is on the lane with this plate

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:25.681
No. 9

01:07:25.681 --> 01:07:26.801
Remember it

01:07:26.801 --> 01:07:27.921
I will

01:07:28.081 --> 01:07:29.321
Goodbye

01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:30.121
Go back indoors!

01:07:30.121 --> 01:07:31.161
Goodbye

01:07:31.161 --> 01:07:32.801
- See you again!
- Take care on the road!

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:37.841
<i>”Mr Lu Xun insisted on seeing us off
on the alley"</i>

01:07:38.601 --> 01:07:39.721
<i>"I was thinking..."</i>

01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:41.721
<i>"Why did he insist on</i>

01:07:42.681 --> 01:07:44.761
<i>seeing off his two young guests?"</i>

01:07:45.121 --> 01:07:46.601
<i>"The rain would wet his hair"</i>

01:07:46.601 --> 01:07:49.921
<i>"He could catch a chill and be ill again"</i>

01:08:07.281 --> 01:08:09.561
<i>Xiao Hong is a better writer than you are</i>

01:08:11.401 --> 01:08:12.641
Xiao Hong's characters

01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:14.721
are so real...

01:08:14.921 --> 01:08:16.201
intensely alive

01:08:16.361 --> 01:08:19.680
We can feel their joys and sorrows

01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:21.841
It's as if we're living their lives

01:08:22.481 --> 01:08:23.841
And you...

01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:25.321
You're richer in insight

01:08:26.121 --> 01:08:27.401
But we can see...

01:08:27.401 --> 01:08:28.801
Thank you...I can't drink much

01:08:28.801 --> 01:08:29.801
That's enough

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.481
But we can see...

01:08:31.481 --> 01:08:33.961
You're so painstaking

01:08:33.961 --> 01:08:36.041
- in achieving what you do
- Absolutely

01:08:36.041 --> 01:08:38.441
Whereas Xiao Hong's genius is

01:08:38.441 --> 01:08:40.201
that she relies more on her feelings

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.241
It's really something precious

01:08:43.441 --> 01:08:44.560
Precious

01:08:45.881 --> 01:08:48.281
I've always thought highly of her talents

01:08:49.201 --> 01:08:51.201
But she still needs my help

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.441
Xiao Hong is there alone

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.481
I told Haiying to play with her

01:09:20.881 --> 01:09:22.801
Go and keep her company

01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:34.401
Haiying...

01:09:34.401 --> 01:09:35.961
Go fetch your toy bricks

01:09:35.961 --> 01:09:39.560
Then you can play with me
and Auntie Xiao Hong, all right?

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.921
Can I finish this first?

01:09:41.921 --> 01:09:44.761
I have to fix my car

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.321
<i>Xiao Hong is in the front room again</i>

01:09:50.841 --> 01:09:53.161
<i>She spends half the day just sitting there</i>

01:09:53.881 --> 01:09:55.841
<i>I don't have time to keep her company</i>

01:10:14.361 --> 01:10:17.001
She's suffering, lonely...

01:10:17.401 --> 01:10:19.681
She has nowhere else to go

01:10:20.401 --> 01:10:22.961
So how can I turn her away?

01:10:28.721 --> 01:10:32.201
Miss Xiao Hong was a powerful writer

01:10:33.161 --> 01:10:37.161
But in dealing with her problems,
she was far too emotional...

01:10:39.241 --> 01:10:41.801
...as women always are

01:10:58.481 --> 01:10:59.761
I'll eat out

01:11:22.921 --> 01:11:27.481
<i>During her lifetime,
Xiao Hong never mentioned...</i>

01:11:27.481 --> 01:11:32.641
<i>...her break-up with Xiao Jun</i>

01:11:33.801 --> 01:11:36.001
<i>So we'll never know exactly how it happened</i>

01:11:49.761 --> 01:11:54.641
We are both prone to sickness

01:11:56.761 --> 01:11:58.241
It pains me...

01:12:00.521 --> 01:12:02.161
It seems I have spent my whole life...

01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:08.081
...being ill and scolding others

01:12:11.321 --> 01:12:16.361
I lost all my teeth before the age of 30

01:12:17.561 --> 01:12:19.681
So I have a mouthful of false teeth

01:12:21.401 --> 01:12:22.801
I gave up drinking...

01:12:23.521 --> 01:12:25.201
Took cod liver oil...

01:12:26.601 --> 01:12:28.961
...to prolong my life

01:12:31.041 --> 01:12:33.641
Not only for my loved ones...

01:12:35.361 --> 01:12:38.001
...but also for my enemies

01:12:41.761 --> 01:12:43.601
I know...

01:12:46.241 --> 01:12:48.041
I'm not a magnanimous man

01:13:03.161 --> 01:13:04.881
For me, to speak of happiness...

01:13:07.561 --> 01:13:09.601
...means either looking back
to the old days...

01:13:12.641 --> 01:13:15.321
...or looking forward

01:13:15.961 --> 01:13:18.761
to my final resting place

01:13:22.521 --> 01:13:24.921
All warriors are like this

01:13:28.241 --> 01:13:30.601
We live in such a place...

01:13:34.161 --> 01:13:36.481
We live at such a time...

01:14:05.361 --> 01:14:11.481
<i>Mr Lu Xun hosted a farewell dinner
for Xiao Hong in his home</i>

01:14:14.081 --> 01:14:17.361
<i>Madam Xu prepared the food herself</i>

01:14:18.681 --> 01:14:20.321
<i>Xiao Hong left for Japan</i>

01:14:23.321 --> 01:14:24.761
Lu Xun must have known about the crisis

01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:27.321
between Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun

01:14:29.481 --> 01:14:32.401
But he never said anything

01:14:36.241 --> 01:14:38.121
Maybe he felt he shouldn't interfere

01:14:40.721 --> 01:14:43.201
<i>Lu Xun introduced his friend Huang Yuan</i>

01:14:43.801 --> 01:14:46.561
<i>He advised Xiao Hong
to spend some time in Japan...</i>

01:14:46.561 --> 01:14:47.921
<i>...to write and to rest</i>

01:14:48.481 --> 01:14:51.201
<i>Huang's wife Yuehua was studying in Japan...</i>

01:14:51.481 --> 01:14:53.321
<i>...so she could take care of Xiao Hong</i>

01:14:54.441 --> 01:14:56.881
<i>Xiao Jun was moving to Qingdao</i>

01:15:04.081 --> 01:15:05.361
<i>"Jun..."</i>

01:15:05.841 --> 01:15:10.081
<i>"Today I went out for the first time"</i>

01:15:10.281 --> 01:15:11.881
<i>"I went into Jinbocho"</i>

01:15:12.601 --> 01:15:14.521
<i>"It's a district full of bookshops"</i>

01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:18.721
<i>"But I didn't much enjoy it,
since I was alone"</i>

01:15:19.601 --> 01:15:21.241
<i>"I walked back the same way"</i>

01:15:21.841 --> 01:15:23.361
<i>"Everything was fresh to me"</i>

01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:27.201
<i>"The streets and sights are quite different"</i>

01:15:28.361 --> 01:15:30.001
<i>"But there's a black river..."</i>

01:15:30.201 --> 01:15:31.841
<i>"...just like the one in Shanghai"</i>

01:15:31.841 --> 01:15:33.641
<i>"Sorry-looking boats bobbed on it"</i>

01:15:33.921 --> 01:15:36.561
<i>"There were women with their children..."</i>

01:15:36.561 --> 01:15:38.561
<i>"...in ragged clothes"</i>

01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:41.521
<i>"And the dark water smelt just the same"</i>

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:47.521
<i>Most of these letters were sent</i>

01:15:48.281 --> 01:15:52.721
<i>by Xiao Hong in 1936 and 1937</i>

01:15:53.241 --> 01:15:55.321
<i>While she was in Tokyo</i>

01:15:55.761 --> 01:15:58.801
<i>I've been roaming around
for more than forty years...</i>

01:15:59.561 --> 01:16:02.401
<i>So the fact that these letters
have survived...</i>

01:16:03.361 --> 01:16:05.721
<i>...and can be published today...</i>

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:10.761
<i>...is little short of miraculous</i>

01:16:23.721 --> 01:16:26.681
If you get lost, ask a passer-by

01:16:27.081 --> 01:16:28.401
Travel safely, Yuehua!

01:16:28.721 --> 01:16:32.921
<i>"Jun, Yuehua is taking me to a doctor
for a check-up"</i>

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:35.441
<i>"Very cheap, only two dollars!"</i>

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:37.161
<i>"Without her help,"</i>

01:16:37.161 --> 01:16:40.721
<i>"I wouldn't have been able to go"</i>

01:16:41.881 --> 01:16:43.441
<i>"You probably haven't heard..."</i>

01:16:43.441 --> 01:16:46.401
<i>"Her father-in-law is ill,
and they have no money"</i>

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:48.561
<i>"So Yuehua has to go back"</i>

01:16:50.241 --> 01:16:52.281
<i>"Once she's gone, damn it,</i>

01:16:52.281 --> 01:16:54.001
<i>I'll have no friend here"</i>

01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:12.201
<i>"Jun, "</i>

01:17:15.041 --> 01:17:17.881
<i>"I've had a fever for some days"</i>

01:17:18.961 --> 01:17:20.801
<i>"My lips are chapped"</i>

01:17:24.441 --> 01:17:27.881
<i>"Of course, everyone has to die"</i>

01:17:29.641 --> 01:17:31.721
<i>"But knowing the fact is one thing..."</i>

01:17:33.001 --> 01:17:35.521
<i>"Accepting it emotionally is another"</i>

01:17:39.081 --> 01:17:42.921
<i>"Now he's been gone for five days"</i>

01:17:45.281 --> 01:17:47.761
<i>"Where is he sleeping now?"</i>

01:18:00.001 --> 01:18:07.961
"Mr. Lu Xun's tomb"

01:18:21.561 --> 01:18:25.521
<i>"Jun, when moonlight whitens the window..."</i>

01:18:26.561 --> 01:18:29.761
<i>like to turn off the light
and sit in silence"</i>

01:18:29.961 --> 01:18:34.761
<i>"Then suddenly the sound
of a bell in my heart"</i>

01:18:35.601 --> 01:18:40.121
<i>"breaks the silence"</i>

01:18:42.121 --> 01:18:45.641
<i>"Isn't this my golden era? Right now?"</i>

01:18:50.001 --> 01:18:54.241
<i>"I touch the tablecloth,
I turn around, I touch the chair...”</i>

01:18:54.241 --> 01:18:56.041
<i>"I raise my hands in front of me"</i>

01:18:56.041 --> 01:18:57.521
<i>"It's rather vague..."</i>

01:18:57.721 --> 01:19:01.241
<i>"But I'm sure these are my hands"</i>

01:19:03.241 --> 01:19:04.441
<i>"Yes..."</i>

01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:07.561
<i>"I'm in Japan...</i>

01:19:09.361 --> 01:19:11.601
<i>free and comfortable"</i>

01:19:11.841 --> 01:19:13.921
<i>"Calm and carefree"</i>

01:19:14.241 --> 01:19:16.481
<i>"No money worries"</i>

01:19:17.681 --> 01:19:20.041
<i>"It really is my golden era"</i>

01:19:22.121 --> 01:19:24.001
<i>"And I'm spending it in a cage"</i>

01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:32.561
<i>”As for love,</i>

01:19:33.241 --> 01:19:37.001
<i>I was once unfaithful to her"</i>

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.561
<i>"During our time together,"</i>

01:19:40.081 --> 01:19:44.321
<i>"she was faithful to me"</i>

01:19:45.041 --> 01:19:46.561
<i>"It's a fact, I admit it”</i>

01:19:48.081 --> 01:19:49.761
<i>"But while she was in Japan..."</i>

01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:52.841
<i>had an affair with Yuehua"</i>

01:19:53.401 --> 01:19:57.001
<i>"It didn't last long"</i>

01:19:58.361 --> 01:20:03.601
<i>"Yuehua and I both knew
that we couldn't stay together”</i>

01:20:05.081 --> 01:20:08.601
<i>"So, to end our fruitless affair,"</i>

01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:11.361
<i>"we agreed..."</i>

01:20:11.881 --> 01:20:15.401
<i>"...to urge Xiao Hong to return from Japan"</i>

01:20:16.401 --> 01:20:21.681
<i>"So that's what we did,
however much it pained us"</i>

01:21:09.681 --> 01:21:11.481
I tried to lose myself in writing

01:21:11.481 --> 01:21:12.841
To forget my misery

01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:14.761
But it was too much to bear

01:21:16.241 --> 01:21:17.681
When I couldn't stand it any more...

01:21:19.281 --> 01:21:23.521
...I crept outside to walk in the streets

01:21:24.601 --> 01:21:26.321
The desolate streets...

01:21:26.321 --> 01:21:27.761
I wandered about...

01:21:29.521 --> 01:21:30.561
...like a ghost

01:21:42.001 --> 01:21:46.161
He ended his affair with Yuehua

01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:49.281
for moral reasons...

01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:56.121
But he'd got her pregnant

01:22:00.641 --> 01:22:02.841
<i>She had an abortion</i>

01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:18.241
I didn't hate her

01:22:19.521 --> 01:22:23.881
I didn't let it end our friendship

01:22:26.601 --> 01:22:28.161
I still respected her

01:22:29.481 --> 01:22:34.041
I was grateful she'd taken care of me in Japan

01:22:35.361 --> 01:22:36.721
Soseki's novels

01:22:36.721 --> 01:22:40.801
took issue with the Meiji period's view
of the world...

01:22:43.521 --> 01:22:45.161
Let me introduce you

01:22:45.161 --> 01:22:47.041
This is the Japanese writer, Mr Uchida

01:22:47.041 --> 01:22:48.601
And his translator

01:22:49.321 --> 01:22:50.721
You must know Jin Yi already

01:22:51.801 --> 01:22:52.841
Xiao Jun

01:22:52.841 --> 01:22:54.601
- Xiao Hong
- Nice to meet you

01:22:54.601 --> 01:22:56.161
Sit here, Xiao Jun

01:23:02.121 --> 01:23:03.601
What happened to your eye?

01:23:03.601 --> 01:23:04.561
What happened?

01:23:07.241 --> 01:23:09.401
You're lucky the eye itself wasn't hurt

01:23:10.201 --> 01:23:11.241
Does it hurt?

01:23:11.521 --> 01:23:13.281
Be more careful!

01:23:14.881 --> 01:23:15.961
It's nothing

01:23:17.081 --> 01:23:20.081
I bumped into something

01:23:22.761 --> 01:23:24.721
in the dark

01:23:29.481 --> 01:23:30.681
It's all right

01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:36.921
What would you like?

01:23:38.121 --> 01:23:39.161
Anything

01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:42.401
I go this way

01:23:44.281 --> 01:23:45.641
Be careful!

01:23:46.001 --> 01:23:47.561
Ok, no problem

01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:49.361
What are you hiding?

01:23:50.001 --> 01:23:51.081
I hit her

01:23:54.281 --> 01:23:55.401
Don't listen to him

01:23:56.001 --> 01:23:57.201
It wasn't deliberate

01:23:57.601 --> 01:23:59.001
He was drunk, I tried to stop him drinking

01:23:59.001 --> 01:24:01.961
He pushed me aside, and I hit something

01:24:02.881 --> 01:24:04.321
Don't defend me!

01:24:04.321 --> 01:24:05.561
Leave me alone!

01:24:30.121 --> 01:24:32.961
I first met them one morning

01:24:33.721 --> 01:24:37.001
Back then,

01:24:37.001 --> 01:24:38.881
we were working for the magazine <i>The Fight</i>

01:24:39.361 --> 01:24:41.201
I lived across the river,

01:24:41.881 --> 01:24:44.761
and the ferry stopped running at midnight

01:24:45.921 --> 01:24:48.241
<i>I never finished work until late,</i>

01:24:49.601 --> 01:24:51.041
<i>so I couldn't get home</i>

01:24:51.041 --> 01:24:52.201
<i>I had no money for a hotel,</i>

01:24:52.881 --> 01:24:55.081
<i>so I had to sleep in the quarantine boat</i>

<i>The guy in charge, Yu Fei, was my friend</i>

01:24:58.561 --> 01:25:02.361
<i>That morning I went on board to do my job</i>

01:25:05.681 --> 01:25:06.721
Sit down, everyone!

01:25:07.121 --> 01:25:09.481
When you've been checked, you can go!

01:25:18.241 --> 01:25:19.321
Xiao Jun!

01:25:20.921 --> 01:25:21.841
Yu Fei

01:25:24.321 --> 01:25:25.441
It's you!

01:25:26.881 --> 01:25:28.001
She's seasick...

01:25:29.201 --> 01:25:31.081
Xi Jin! Over here!

01:25:33.441 --> 01:25:35.001
Help them into our boat

"ZHANG MEILIN Writer"

01:25:39.521 --> 01:25:41.681
When I saw Xiao Hong again in Wuhan...

01:25:42.201 --> 01:25:43.601
...I felt she'd changed,

01:25:43.601 --> 01:25:45.001
but I couldn't work out how

01:25:48.881 --> 01:25:51.001
Lots of people visited their place,

01:25:51.001 --> 01:25:52.681
mostly writers and artists

01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:55.241
One day a pale-faced man turned up

01:25:55.241 --> 01:25:57.841
He was slightly hunched over
and wore smart clothes

01:26:02.361 --> 01:26:03.281
Xiao Jun!

01:26:03.281 --> 01:26:04.241
Look who's here!

01:26:05.561 --> 01:26:07.041
- I can manage
- Who is it?

Hey! Duanmu!

01:26:12.681 --> 01:26:14.401
- You got my letter?
- Of course!

01:26:14.401 --> 01:26:16.121
If I hadn't, I would be here!

01:26:16.121 --> 01:26:17.281
Sit down

01:26:17.921 --> 01:26:19.081
Have some tea

01:26:19.281 --> 01:26:22.281
I didn't think the letter
would reach you so quickly

01:26:25.201 --> 01:26:27.681
I have to look up a friend
to find me a place to live

01:26:31.721 --> 01:26:33.201
Why bother?

01:26:33.361 --> 01:26:35.161
You can stay here

01:26:35.161 --> 01:26:36.681
Right? It'll be no trouble

01:26:36.681 --> 01:26:38.441
Hu Feng and Nie come by every day

01:26:38.801 --> 01:26:40.841
Xi Jin has a room to himself,

01:26:40.841 --> 01:26:41.881
let's ask him

01:26:41.881 --> 01:26:43.441
Don't bother Xi Jin

01:26:43.441 --> 01:26:44.681
You can sleep in our room

01:26:44.681 --> 01:26:45.641
It's a big bed

01:26:45.641 --> 01:26:47.961
I'll sleep in the middle,
Xiao Hong on the inside, you on the outside

01:26:47.961 --> 01:26:49.281
You won't fall off, I promise!

01:27:13.721 --> 01:27:14.881
You haven't had a cigarette all day

01:27:14.881 --> 01:27:15.921
Don't you want one?

01:27:26.041 --> 01:27:29.001
Actually, I don't smoke

01:27:33.841 --> 01:27:36.801
But when I read your novel...

01:27:36.801 --> 01:27:37.841
...I had a cigarette

01:27:41.361 --> 01:27:42.961
We hadn't met back then

01:27:44.721 --> 01:27:45.641
Thank you

01:27:52.281 --> 01:27:56.001
Xiao Jun says your writing lacks power

01:27:58.041 --> 01:28:00.441
But I think <i>The Field of Life and Death</i>
is bold and forceful

01:28:00.761 --> 01:28:02.641
It's better than his <i>Village in August</i>

01:28:06.161 --> 01:28:09.161
You get closer to the essence of literature

01:28:10.401 --> 01:28:12.041
You're the more talented

01:28:14.961 --> 01:28:16.881
They always said my novels were no good

01:28:17.281 --> 01:28:21.641
That was because I didn't write
the way they expected

01:28:22.561 --> 01:28:24.001
I don't believe in rules

01:28:24.561 --> 01:28:25.721
There should be as many types of novel

01:28:25.721 --> 01:28:27.601
as there are writers

01:28:29.081 --> 01:28:30.121
I agree

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:40.801
You like my gloves?

01:28:53.401 --> 01:28:56.201
You have such small hands! Fits me perfectly!

01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:01.921
You really are so bourgeois

01:29:03.641 --> 01:29:04.641
Let's go

01:29:14.001 --> 01:29:16.161

01:29:18.481 --> 01:29:19.361
Xi Jin!

01:29:19.361 --> 01:29:21.281
- Good of you to come!
- We are here to say good bye

01:29:21.281 --> 01:29:23.041
In January 1938,

01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:25.721
<i>Li Gongpu, founder of
the People's Revolutionary University...</i>

01:29:25.721 --> 01:29:27.121
<i>...arrived in Wuhan from Shanxi</i>

01:29:27.681 --> 01:29:30.721
<i>He came to enlist
intellectuals to teach at Linfen</i>

01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:33.281
<i>Six of us writing for our magazine July
agreed to go</i>

01:29:33.481 --> 01:29:35.601
<i>Everyone except Hu Feng</i>

01:29:35.601 --> 01:29:36.801
<i>The other six,</i>

01:29:37.001 --> 01:29:40.001
<i>Xiao Hong, Xiao Jun, Duanmu, Nie,</i>

01:29:40.001 --> 01:29:40.961
<i>Ai Qing and Tian Jian...</i>

01:29:40.961 --> 01:29:42.321
<i>...all volunteered to go to Linfen</i>

01:29:43.321 --> 01:29:46.881
<i>The University also recruited students
from Wuhan</i>

01:31:01.041 --> 01:31:03.041
The north is a sad country...

01:31:24.641 --> 01:31:26.641
Zhang Mutao, Trotskyite and spy
for the Japanese...

01:31:27.241 --> 01:31:29.481
...after the Xi'an Incident...

01:31:29.641 --> 01:31:33.401
...stirred up militants
in the Communist armies of the north

01:31:33.401 --> 01:31:36.201
He took advantage of their wish
to rescue Zhang Xueliang

01:31:36.201 --> 01:31:38.601
And incited them
to attack the Kuomintang army...

01:31:38.601 --> 01:31:40.241
...to overthrow Chiang Kaishek

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:42.801
When the anti-Japanese war began,

01:31:43.001 --> 01:31:45.041
Zhang Mutao returned to Taiyuan...

01:31:45.401 --> 01:31:46.601
...and agitated against

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:49.841
unified resistance to the Japanese

01:31:49.841 --> 01:31:53.321
He denounced the United Front of Communists
and Nationalists...

01:31:53.321 --> 01:31:55.641
...as "class capitulationism"!

01:31:55.641 --> 01:32:00.641
Down with Zhang Mutao!

01:32:13.721 --> 01:32:14.721
Ding Ling!

01:32:16.321 --> 01:32:18.121
- Xiao Jun!
- It is you

01:32:18.441 --> 01:32:21.041
- I hardly recognized you!
- Long time no see!

01:32:21.761 --> 01:32:22.601
Xiao Hong!

01:32:22.601 --> 01:32:23.641
Ding Ling is here!

01:32:25.121 --> 01:32:25.961
- Take a rest,
- Wait a moment

01:32:25.961 --> 01:32:27.521
everyone, and wait for orders!

01:32:27.521 --> 01:32:28.521
Dismiss!

01:32:29.641 --> 01:32:30.881
Thank you

01:32:33.001 --> 01:32:34.281
You must be Xiao Hong!

01:32:38.001 --> 01:32:39.041
Hello

01:32:39.041 --> 01:32:40.081
Ding Ling

01:32:41.281 --> 01:32:42.281
Hello

01:32:45.041 --> 01:32:48.161
Let's go inside, come on

01:32:50.601 --> 01:32:53.001
Don't say that, don't say that...

01:32:53.001 --> 01:32:54.361
I'll stop here!

01:32:55.601 --> 01:32:57.121
Don't say that, don't say that...

01:32:57.121 --> 01:32:57.721
Are you hungry

01:32:57.721 --> 01:33:01.881
<i>"It was early spring when I met Xiao Hong"</i>

01:33:02.761 --> 01:33:04.841
<i>"It was still cold in Shanxi at the time"</i>

01:33:04.841 --> 01:33:07.041
<i>"I'd been in the army for a long time..."</i>

01:33:07.041 --> 01:33:08.961
<i>"...so I was used to hardship"</i>

01:33:09.241 --> 01:33:11.441
<i>”When I saw her pale face...</i> ”

01:33:11.801 --> 01:33:13.761
<i>"Her determined lips..."</i>

01:33:14.481 --> 01:33:18.001
<i>"Her agile manner, her nervous laughter..."</i>

01:33:18.961 --> 01:33:20.841
<i>felt she was special"</i>

01:33:21.321 --> 01:33:23.321
<i>I thought back to my own youth</i>

01:33:26.561 --> 01:33:29.841
<i>"But her talk was natural and direct"</i>

01:33:30.761 --> 01:33:33.881
<i>"I felt it strange that she,
as a writer..."</i>

01:33:33.881 --> 01:33:36.001
<i>"...seemed so naive"</i>

01:33:36.761 --> 01:33:40.281
<i>"Maybe women are unashamed
to appear ingenuous”</i>

01:33:40.841 --> 01:33:42.081
<i>"And that's why</i>

01:33:42.081 --> 01:33:45.241
<i>she seemed so naive and vulnerable"</i>

01:33:50.121 --> 01:33:52.001
<i>"But we got along very well"</i>

01:33:52.361 --> 01:33:55.041
<i>"She was forthright"</i>

01:33:55.761 --> 01:33:58.281
<i>"We sang together heartily..."</i>

01:33:58.841 --> 01:34:01.561
<i>"...and talked into the night"</i>

01:34:02.561 --> 01:34:03.841
When I was in Yan'an...

01:34:04.241 --> 01:34:07.081
...I helped collect material about
the Red Army

01:34:08.281 --> 01:34:10.841
Now I'm editing

01:34:11.881 --> 01:34:15.161
a history of the Long March

01:34:15.161 --> 01:34:16.561
Based on accounts by the soldiers themselves

01:34:17.361 --> 01:34:18.881
It's called <i>Our Story</i>

01:34:20.521 --> 01:34:23.481
Every day I go through testimonies...

01:34:23.481 --> 01:34:25.961
...written on all kinds of paper,
in all colors

01:34:26.081 --> 01:34:28.881
They describe heart-warming actions,
fired by a great spirit

01:34:29.281 --> 01:34:30.921
It's deeply moving

01:34:32.401 --> 01:34:36.681
I conclude that writing skills alone...

01:34:36.681 --> 01:34:39.121
...aren't enough to achieve great work

01:34:39.921 --> 01:34:42.161
While I was writing my first novel...

01:34:42.361 --> 01:34:45.001
...I felt two opposing forces at war inside me

01:34:46.401 --> 01:34:48.961
My blood was telling me I was a writer

01:34:48.961 --> 01:34:52.241
But my soul was filled
with the passion of a warrior

01:34:53.401 --> 01:34:54.641
When I reached the Red Army base in Yan'an...

01:34:55.841 --> 01:34:57.881
...I decided to give up writing

01:34:58.321 --> 01:34:59.841
I think my great work will be

01:34:59.841 --> 01:35:03.361
my actual life and my fighting!

01:35:06.161 --> 01:35:08.161
So the old Ding Ling died...

01:35:09.321 --> 01:35:11.721
...and a new Ding Ling was born

01:35:13.241 --> 01:35:14.281
Is that it?

01:35:15.401 --> 01:35:17.441
I've written in my diary that...

01:35:18.681 --> 01:35:21.521
...when a great mission confronts you...

01:35:21.921 --> 01:35:23.881
...you must forget your own insignificance

01:35:44.281 --> 01:35:47.681
We stayed in the Revolutionary University
for only 20 days

01:35:47.681 --> 01:35:51.761
The Japanese Army started shelling Linfen

01:35:52.001 --> 01:35:55.121
The university decided the writers
should be evacuated

01:35:55.121 --> 01:35:56.281
Those willing to stay

01:35:56.281 --> 01:35:58.801
would retreat with the university staff

01:35:58.801 --> 01:36:00.161
The others

01:36:00.161 --> 01:36:03.081
would leave for Xi'an

01:36:03.321 --> 01:36:05.001
Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun disagreed

01:36:05.001 --> 01:36:08.161
about which group to follow

01:36:08.481 --> 01:36:09.521
I've thought it through...

01:36:09.761 --> 01:36:11.121
I'm going to stay and form a guerrilla unit

01:36:11.681 --> 01:36:14.321
What about me?

01:36:14.521 --> 01:36:15.521
You know that

01:36:15.521 --> 01:36:17.681
all I want is a peaceful situation to write in

01:36:17.681 --> 01:36:19.481
You know that this is
what I've always longed for

01:36:19.481 --> 01:36:21.801
Even back in Harbin,
I wanted to join a guerrilla war

01:36:22.161 --> 01:36:23.841
I'm not content to just be a writer

01:36:24.081 --> 01:36:25.121
It's not my goal in life!

01:36:25.121 --> 01:36:26.161
San Lang

01:36:29.721 --> 01:36:31.601
I know I won't live long

01:36:33.361 --> 01:36:36.201
I don't want to go on suffering

01:36:36.201 --> 01:36:37.441
all these hardships

01:36:37.441 --> 01:36:38.481
San Lang!

01:36:46.881 --> 01:36:49.321
Many of those who die in battle have talents!

01:36:49.681 --> 01:36:51.801
We're all fighting for liberation

01:36:52.121 --> 01:36:54.481
Why should some preserve their talent

01:36:54.481 --> 01:36:55.961
while others die?

01:36:56.081 --> 01:36:58.961
Each contributes what he is best able to

01:36:59.161 --> 01:37:00.681
You're forgetting your duty as a writer!

01:37:02.801 --> 01:37:05.401
You're being willfully blind!

01:37:05.961 --> 01:37:07.441
I haven't forgotten anything!

01:37:09.321 --> 01:37:11.281
Let's go our separate ways

01:37:12.081 --> 01:37:13.481
If I die...

01:37:14.241 --> 01:37:15.841
I don't think I'll die,

01:37:17.361 --> 01:37:18.761
Some day we'll see each other again

01:37:19.361 --> 01:37:21.001
And can be together

01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:22.201
But if we don't

01:37:23.801 --> 01:37:25.321
we can make it a permanent break

01:37:34.561 --> 01:37:35.601
All right

01:37:45.681 --> 01:37:46.921
You aren't sleeping?

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:48.441
Soon

01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:01.401
Aren't you asleep yet?

01:38:04.521 --> 01:38:06.561
Haven't you two finished?

01:38:06.561 --> 01:38:08.721
I'm really tired of your arguments

01:38:10.961 --> 01:38:12.481
It's nothing to joke about

01:38:13.481 --> 01:38:17.001
These arguments make us so unhappy

01:38:20.201 --> 01:38:21.961
It's better that we go our separate ways

01:38:26.721 --> 01:38:28.241
Never mind

01:38:28.241 --> 01:38:30.241
I'll sleep outside

01:38:30.401 --> 01:38:31.761
You two make up

01:38:31.761 --> 01:38:34.041
- We're moving out tomorrow!
- Ding Ling!

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:35.761
Don't come out

01:38:35.761 --> 01:38:37.241
We're all men out here!

01:38:37.241 --> 01:38:39.001
What does it matter!

01:38:39.921 --> 01:38:41.001
Don't go out

01:38:59.961 --> 01:39:01.361
I won't go to Xi'an

01:39:04.361 --> 01:39:05.681
I'd rather stay with you

01:39:06.001 --> 01:39:07.561
We can live or die together!

01:39:07.801 --> 01:39:09.641
Or you could come with us

01:39:12.041 --> 01:39:14.201
I won't rest easy if you stay here alone

01:39:14.441 --> 01:39:16.321
I know your temper

01:39:17.001 --> 01:39:18.201
Don't be silly

01:39:20.001 --> 01:39:21.321
You all leave first

01:39:22.521 --> 01:39:25.401
If nothing changes here, you can come back

01:39:25.401 --> 01:39:26.761
It'll be the same as before

01:39:28.041 --> 01:39:29.081
Xiao Jun...

01:39:29.961 --> 01:39:32.721
Don't make Xiao Hong so anxious

01:39:33.601 --> 01:39:35.161
He's stronger than us

01:39:35.601 --> 01:39:37.201
He fights well

01:39:37.361 --> 01:39:39.121
He runs fast

01:39:39.721 --> 01:39:41.201
He should stay

01:39:41.881 --> 01:39:43.721
You're not weak yourself!

01:39:45.241 --> 01:39:47.121
Why don't you stay?

01:39:48.321 --> 01:39:50.521
How can we compare with Xiao Jun?

01:39:50.961 --> 01:39:53.121
It's his chance to serve the country

01:39:53.401 --> 01:39:54.841
What about you? Duanmu,

01:39:56.041 --> 01:39:57.321
why don't you stay too?

01:39:58.281 --> 01:39:59.761
Stay here and work with me

01:39:59.961 --> 01:40:01.201
Then I won't be lonely

01:40:01.401 --> 01:40:02.921
There are many students here to teach

01:40:03.481 --> 01:40:06.001
No, I'd better go to Xi'an

01:40:06.801 --> 01:40:09.681
I'd rather not die in battle

01:40:15.601 --> 01:40:16.681
Don't worry

01:40:17.441 --> 01:40:20.121
I've survived a lot already

01:40:20.961 --> 01:40:22.761
But that was then!

01:40:23.841 --> 01:40:25.281
Things are different now!

01:40:26.401 --> 01:40:28.641
You've never listened to me!

01:40:35.761 --> 01:40:37.321
Let him go

01:40:38.281 --> 01:40:39.761
He's a capable man

01:40:39.881 --> 01:40:41.481
He can look after himself

01:40:42.761 --> 01:40:44.361
You just love him too much

01:40:45.801 --> 01:40:49.521
You'll just make the man you love feel bad

01:40:53.241 --> 01:40:54.601
I've had enough!

01:40:54.601 --> 01:40:56.481
The wind and the dust!

01:40:58.721 --> 01:41:00.721
My nose and ears always filthy!

01:41:06.441 --> 01:41:08.961
You can always shut yourself away
indoors to write...

01:41:09.641 --> 01:41:10.961
Are you serious?

01:41:12.401 --> 01:41:14.041
What exactly are you trying to tell me?

01:41:19.641 --> 01:41:20.841
Nothing

01:41:21.401 --> 01:41:22.601
It's still about Xiao Hong

01:41:23.841 --> 01:41:24.681
I know

01:41:24.681 --> 01:41:26.401
Take care of Xiao Hong!

01:41:26.401 --> 01:41:27.881
You've said it a hundred times

01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:28.961
Yes...

01:41:29.601 --> 01:41:31.201
Her health is fragile

01:41:31.441 --> 01:41:33.321
And she can't cope

01:41:34.481 --> 01:41:36.721
When you reach Xi'an, if she want

01:41:36.721 --> 01:41:38.681
try to send her to Yan'an

01:41:39.161 --> 01:41:41.401
Otherwise, keep her in your troupe

01:41:41.401 --> 01:41:43.961
Just don't leave her alone

01:41:45.361 --> 01:41:48.441
Anyway, she and I will meet again

01:41:48.441 --> 01:41:49.641
Right!

01:41:50.081 --> 01:41:52.401
So why were you so callous yesterday?

01:41:52.401 --> 01:41:54.161
Now you're all care and concern!

01:42:05.721 --> 01:42:06.841
Comrades,

01:42:07.041 --> 01:42:09.561
let's sing a song for Xiao Jun!

01:42:09.561 --> 01:42:11.081
Good!

01:42:50.361 --> 01:42:51.561
Have you eaten?

01:42:51.561 --> 01:42:53.041
Not yet, I was about to

01:42:53.041 --> 01:42:53.961
And you?

01:42:54.521 --> 01:42:55.601
I've eaten

01:42:55.601 --> 01:42:56.761
But I'll treat you

01:42:57.801 --> 01:42:59.361
No need for that

01:42:59.641 --> 01:43:01.161
I must treat you tonight

01:43:01.161 --> 01:43:02.761
I insist

01:43:07.241 --> 01:43:08.601
Can you do me a favor?

01:43:10.721 --> 01:43:11.881
What?

01:43:14.681 --> 01:43:15.921
Look...

01:43:15.921 --> 01:43:17.001
You like this?

01:43:20.161 --> 01:43:22.001
I've kept it for a couple of years

01:43:26.681 --> 01:43:29.041
Today, Duanmu asked me to give it to him

01:43:29.601 --> 01:43:31.241
I told him to wait

01:43:34.601 --> 01:43:35.921
I'm going to hide it...

01:43:35.921 --> 01:43:37.841
...and tell him I gave it to you

01:43:40.201 --> 01:43:41.561
If he asks,

01:43:43.081 --> 01:43:45.001
will you tell him you have it?

01:43:46.761 --> 01:43:49.921
What does the stick symbolize?

01:43:52.001 --> 01:43:54.001
What are you thinking?

01:43:57.201 --> 01:43:59.881
I've told you I find Duanmu tiresome

01:44:00.281 --> 01:44:02.841
He's soft, cowardly...

01:44:03.481 --> 01:44:06.881
You've also said that you have a spirit
of self-sacrifice

01:44:07.041 --> 01:44:08.921
That's only where Xiao Jun is concerned!

01:44:12.001 --> 01:44:15.801
Xiao Jun says you're easily fooled

01:44:15.801 --> 01:44:17.801
Not when it really matters

01:44:24.401 --> 01:44:27.561
Xiao Hong, let's go to Yan'an together

01:44:30.201 --> 01:44:31.281
I don't think so

01:44:31.281 --> 01:44:32.361
Why not?

01:44:32.681 --> 01:44:34.681
I might meet Xiao Jun there

01:44:35.001 --> 01:44:36.601
I doubt it

01:44:36.601 --> 01:44:38.681
His temperament won't take him there

01:44:38.681 --> 01:44:42.201
He must have joined the guerrillas by now

01:44:50.841 --> 01:44:52.281
I love Xiao Jun

01:44:53.601 --> 01:44:55.001
Even now

01:44:59.041 --> 01:45:01.281
He's an excellent writer

01:45:02.761 --> 01:45:05.241
We've battled many hardships together

01:45:08.441 --> 01:45:09.681
But...

01:45:13.041 --> 01:45:18.321
To be his wife would be to suffer too much

01:45:22.841 --> 01:45:23.961
Xiao Hong...

01:45:24.801 --> 01:45:29.161
You've written <i>The Field of Life and Death
and Market Street</i>

01:45:30.561 --> 01:45:33.441
You have to consider
your position in literature

01:45:40.961 --> 01:45:42.801
You must fly high...

01:45:43.641 --> 01:45:48.561
The higher, the better...

01:46:08.201 --> 01:46:12.881
The Tang Dynasty...Preface...

01:46:19.201 --> 01:46:21.481
This is the
<i>Preface to the Three Sacred Doctrines</i>

01:46:22.201 --> 01:46:25.241
As written by the Buddhist monk Huairen

01:46:25.241 --> 01:46:26.761
He used characters copied

01:46:26.761 --> 01:46:28.881
from Wang Xizhi's writings

01:46:30.241 --> 01:46:31.721
It contains

01:46:32.241 --> 01:46:38.681
a preface to Xuanzang's translations
of Buddhist sutras

01:46:39.121 --> 01:46:42.361
Also an essay by Prince Li

01:46:43.521 --> 01:46:47.441
and Xuanzang's note of gratitude

01:46:47.561 --> 01:46:49.841
The entire collection is known as the <i>Preface
to the Three Sacred Doctrines</i>

01:46:51.081 --> 01:46:53.761
You've stored up a lot of learning

01:46:54.601 --> 01:46:56.721
I never knew that about you

01:46:58.281 --> 01:47:00.001
I used to study history

01:47:00.001 --> 01:47:01.401
It's nothing special

01:47:03.081 --> 01:47:06.881
It's a real shame
that I know so little about history

01:47:07.841 --> 01:47:09.121
To show my appreciation...

01:47:09.121 --> 01:47:10.481
...I'll treat you to cold noodles tonight

01:47:13.321 --> 01:47:15.841
Since you're so modest, I should treat you

01:47:40.441 --> 01:47:41.521
Look!

01:47:42.481 --> 01:47:45.401
The light from the torch...
Isn't it like a jellyfish?

01:47:49.921 --> 01:47:50.961
Yes

01:48:07.881 --> 01:48:11.321
Ding Ling and I went to Yan'an for ten days

01:48:11.641 --> 01:48:14.281
We brought someone back with us

01:48:21.081 --> 01:48:22.121
We're there!

01:48:22.721 --> 01:48:24.161
We're back!

01:48:25.121 --> 01:48:26.401
Commander Ding is back!

01:48:26.841 --> 01:48:28.201
Hello, everyone!

01:48:33.521 --> 01:48:35.281
How's everything? All right?

01:49:34.801 --> 01:49:36.881
If anything happens,

01:49:36.881 --> 01:49:38.361
please help!

01:49:53.321 --> 01:49:55.441
Dust yourself down first!

01:49:55.441 --> 01:49:57.321
Then me second!

01:49:57.761 --> 01:49:58.801
Understand?

01:50:00.081 --> 01:50:01.121
Yes

01:50:01.641 --> 01:50:02.721
Sure?

01:50:07.481 --> 01:50:08.521
Then go!

01:50:15.761 --> 01:50:18.681
Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun broke up

01:50:20.521 --> 01:50:24.721
What exactly happened remains unknown
to outsiders

01:50:26.041 --> 01:50:28.081
The three parties involved...

01:50:28.361 --> 01:50:29.961
...give conflicting accounts

01:50:31.281 --> 01:50:33.281
In old age, Xiao Jun's version
was like this...

01:50:43.361 --> 01:50:44.561
San Lang...

01:50:47.721 --> 01:50:49.241
Let's separate for good

01:50:57.281 --> 01:50:58.401
All right

01:51:08.081 --> 01:51:10.241
<i>And in old age, Duanmu's version was...</i>

01:51:43.881 --> 01:51:44.921
Xiao Hong...

01:51:45.481 --> 01:51:47.441
I'll marry Ding Ling
You can marry Duanmu

01:51:47.441 --> 01:51:48.721
What are you talking about?

01:51:51.281 --> 01:51:52.921
I don't care who you marry

01:51:53.881 --> 01:51:57.761
My marriage is none of your business!

01:51:58.041 --> 01:52:00.001
You're too arrogant!
What do you take us for?

01:52:03.841 --> 01:52:05.521
I'm trying to do you a favor

01:52:07.041 --> 01:52:10.121
Xiao Jun, don't insult us!

01:52:10.761 --> 01:52:13.041
Is Xiao Hong an object without feelings?

01:52:16.201 --> 01:52:17.841
Look at yourself!

01:52:21.961 --> 01:52:23.321
Get out!

01:52:23.321 --> 01:52:24.521
Xiao Jun,

01:52:26.761 --> 01:52:27.721
let's talk outside

01:52:35.161 --> 01:52:37.921
<i>Given what had happened...</i>

01:52:38.201 --> 01:52:41.481
<i>...I had to make known</i>

01:52:41.481 --> 01:52:45.441
<i>my relationship with Xiao Hong</i>

01:53:30.081 --> 01:53:31.761
I've broken up with Xiao Jun

01:53:33.361 --> 01:53:35.561
I've returned all his letters

01:53:35.761 --> 01:53:37.081
I asked for mine back...

01:53:39.161 --> 01:53:40.521
...but he refused

01:53:42.761 --> 01:53:45.641
He's stronger than me, so I didn't manage...

01:53:48.801 --> 01:53:50.161
...to get them back

01:53:57.441 --> 01:53:59.641
So now you're free

01:54:07.281 --> 01:54:08.921
I have something to tell you

01:54:15.921 --> 01:54:17.521
I'm pregnant with Xiao Jun's child

01:54:20.041 --> 01:54:21.241
Child?

01:54:21.641 --> 01:54:22.801
Four months

01:54:28.281 --> 01:54:29.481
Does he know?

01:54:31.881 --> 01:54:33.281
Of course he does

01:54:33.281 --> 01:54:35.081
And he asked you to marry me?

01:54:41.441 --> 01:54:42.761
That's the kind of man he is

01:54:47.441 --> 01:54:51.761
How could you live with a man like that?

01:54:58.241 --> 01:54:59.681
He thinks I wouldn't dare marry you

01:55:01.361 --> 01:55:03.801
because of the child?

01:55:13.161 --> 01:55:14.321
Come in

01:55:17.801 --> 01:55:18.761
Sit

01:55:21.001 --> 01:55:23.201
I want you to have this

01:55:24.121 --> 01:55:25.521
It's a trophy...

01:55:25.521 --> 01:55:26.921
...captured from the Japanese

01:55:30.521 --> 01:55:33.241
I have nothing to give you

01:55:34.561 --> 01:55:36.881
The best gift is knowing you

01:55:43.561 --> 01:55:44.801
Take care!

01:55:52.761 --> 01:55:55.641
<i>"We spent the whole spring in Xi'an"</i>

01:55:56.521 --> 01:55:58.121
<i>"We drank our fill..."</i>

01:55:58.561 --> 01:56:00.961
<i>"...and spent evenings
in the wind and rain"</i>

01:56:02.081 --> 01:56:04.561
<i>"And yet, now that I think back..."</i>

01:56:04.561 --> 01:56:06.641
<i>"...we didn't talk that much"</i>

01:56:07.561 --> 01:56:10.801
<i>"There are few people"</i>

01:56:11.081 --> 01:56:15.081
<i>"you can talk with freely"</i>

01:56:16.761 --> 01:56:18.481
<i>"Since we said our goodbyes..."</i>

01:56:18.601 --> 01:56:20.641
<i>"...I've never had a letter from Xiao Hong"</i>

01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:23.601
<i>"Duanmu has sent several"</i>

01:56:24.361 --> 01:56:28.401
<i>"The last one arrived
before Hong Kong fell to the Japanese"</i>

01:56:38.721 --> 01:56:42.761
I hear Xiao Hong's ashes
are buried in Repulse Bay

01:56:50.921 --> 01:56:52.241
Do you remember?

01:56:53.801 --> 01:56:55.321
You once told me...

01:56:56.441 --> 01:56:58.481
...that Xiao Hong would die young

01:57:05.681 --> 01:57:08.081
Now your premonition has come true

01:57:23.201 --> 01:57:25.481
This is my essay...

01:57:25.961 --> 01:57:27.721
Remembering Xiao Hong

01:57:49.281 --> 01:57:51.041
After Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun broke up...

01:57:51.561 --> 01:57:53.121
...they never saw each other again

01:57:53.681 --> 01:57:57.041
That same year, in April 1938...

01:57:57.641 --> 01:58:00.281
...Xiao Hong and Duanmu went back to Wuhan

01:58:00.641 --> 01:58:03.681
Xiao Jun went to Yan'an...

01:58:04.121 --> 01:58:06.041
...and then to Xinjiang,

01:58:06.121 --> 01:58:08.201
to fight the Japanese

01:58:09.521 --> 01:58:11.241
As he passed through Lanzhou...

01:58:11.801 --> 01:58:13.001
...he met Wang Defen

01:58:13.681 --> 01:58:16.001
He married her that year

01:58:16.801 --> 01:58:18.321
And they lived together ever after

01:58:18.561 --> 01:58:21.681
They had eight children in all

01:58:39.921 --> 01:58:41.521
I parted from Xiao Jun

01:58:41.801 --> 01:58:43.561
And he went to fight as a guerrilla

01:58:43.561 --> 01:58:47.201
Now I live with him...

01:58:55.001 --> 01:58:56.601
As a woman...

01:58:56.601 --> 01:58:58.921
...you suffered humiliations

01:58:59.121 --> 01:59:00.641
You have the right to do what you want

01:59:01.121 --> 01:59:03.681
It shows how strong you are

01:59:04.801 --> 01:59:06.201
As your friends...

01:59:06.201 --> 01:59:09.241
...we're happy to see you
leave your sufferings behind

01:59:10.521 --> 01:59:12.481
But why be in such a hurry?

01:59:12.921 --> 01:59:14.761
Why not calm down a little?

01:59:19.041 --> 01:59:21.441
Did you see Ding Ling in the north-west?

01:59:21.441 --> 01:59:22.521
How is she?

01:59:23.961 --> 01:59:25.681
We are very different people

01:59:26.841 --> 01:59:28.281
Why didn't you go to Yan'an?

01:59:29.361 --> 01:59:31.641
All I want is to write in peace

01:59:32.281 --> 01:59:34.441
I don't want to be a Party member

01:59:35.161 --> 01:59:38.721
I know nothing about politics,

01:59:40.521 --> 01:59:41.681
nothing at all

01:59:53.121 --> 01:59:54.401
Please be seated

01:59:57.321 --> 01:59:59.921
Thank you for coming to our wedding

02:00:00.681 --> 02:00:02.281
We prepared it in such a rush

02:00:02.281 --> 02:00:05.361
Please excuse us for the shortcomings

02:00:08.121 --> 02:00:09.361
Duanmu...

02:00:13.361 --> 02:00:15.001
These four red beans symbolize mutual longing

02:00:15.001 --> 02:00:18.041
They were given to me by Mr Lu Xun

02:00:18.801 --> 02:00:22.241
Today, I give them to you...

02:00:23.241 --> 02:00:25.041
...as a token of faith

02:00:27.761 --> 02:00:30.441
<i>I heard there weren't many guests
at the wedding</i>

02:00:30.601 --> 02:00:34.641
<i>Most of them were Duanmu's relatives</i>

02:00:39.961 --> 02:00:43.321
Duanmu and I...

02:00:43.321 --> 02:00:47.161
...had no great romance

02:00:47.441 --> 02:00:51.561
It was not until I'd separated from Xiao Jun...

02:00:51.561 --> 02:00:53.241
...that I found Duanmu

02:00:57.081 --> 02:00:59.481
I do not expect too much from him

02:01:00.481 --> 02:01:03.921
All I want is...

02:01:03.921 --> 02:01:08.281
...to live as an ordinary husband and wife

02:01:10.241 --> 02:01:14.041
No quarrels, no fights...

02:01:14.521 --> 02:01:17.361
No betrayals, no mockery...

02:01:17.921 --> 02:01:21.481
Only mutual understanding

02:01:21.481 --> 02:01:23.801
Only care and kindness between us

02:01:28.801 --> 02:01:34.881
I feel deeply that a woman in my situation...

02:01:34.881 --> 02:01:37.041
...is no position to expect to marry

02:01:39.881 --> 02:01:43.801
But Duanmu made a sacrifice

02:01:45.281 --> 02:01:49.041
And that satisfies me

02:01:53.121 --> 02:01:54.801
I'm deeply grateful

02:02:10.041 --> 02:02:14.841
In June and July of 1938,
the Japanese Army prepared its assault

02:02:15.441 --> 02:02:18.921
The government announced a campaign
to 'Protect Great Wuhan'...

02:02:19.681 --> 02:02:21.081
But people began to abandon the city

02:02:21.081 --> 02:02:24.121
They fled to Chungking

02:02:28.641 --> 02:02:31.081
One rainy day in July...

02:02:31.281 --> 02:02:35.081
...I was crossing the river from Wuchang

02:02:36.041 --> 02:02:37.161
Xiao Hong!

02:02:44.321 --> 02:02:48.601
I didn't expect you to greet me!

02:02:55.321 --> 02:02:56.841
I was just thinking...

02:02:59.641 --> 02:03:01.561
I have no friends of my own

02:03:03.081 --> 02:03:05.081
They're all Xiao Jun's friends

02:03:07.721 --> 02:03:09.281
You all belong to him

02:03:17.201 --> 02:03:18.401
Do you have any plans?

02:03:18.761 --> 02:03:20.001
The situation is getting critical

02:03:20.561 --> 02:03:22.201
Many friends are planning to leave

02:03:22.521 --> 02:03:23.721
Are you going?

02:03:25.761 --> 02:03:26.841
I have tickets to Chungking

02:03:26.841 --> 02:03:28.121
I'm going with Luo Feng

02:03:29.641 --> 02:03:31.561
Let's go together! Shall we?

02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:37.801
Help me get two tickets

02:03:54.081 --> 02:03:56.241
<i>At that time, it wasn't easy to get tickets</i>

02:03:56.801 --> 02:03:58.801
<i>I found one for Xiao Hong</i>

02:03:59.841 --> 02:04:01.201
<i>But on the day...</i>

02:04:01.761 --> 02:04:03.041
<i>...it wasn't Xiao Hong who turned up</i>

02:04:09.761 --> 02:04:11.361
I have tickets!

02:04:13.321 --> 02:04:14.561
Where's Xiao Hong?

02:04:15.401 --> 02:04:16.401
She's not coming

02:04:16.401 --> 02:04:18.001
She'll take a later steamer

02:04:18.001 --> 02:04:20.001
I'm going first to look for a house

02:04:22.121 --> 02:04:23.201
Let's go

02:05:18.241 --> 02:05:19.361
Xi Jin!

02:05:22.801 --> 02:05:23.961
What are you doing here?

02:05:24.921 --> 02:05:26.921
I've come to stay here

02:05:29.961 --> 02:05:31.081
And Duanmu?

02:05:31.641 --> 02:05:33.041
He's gone to Chungking

02:05:33.281 --> 02:05:34.561
Why didn't he take you?

02:05:34.561 --> 02:05:36.201
I didn't need taking

02:05:40.401 --> 02:05:41.361
Sit down

02:05:46.041 --> 02:05:47.441
You can't stay here

02:05:48.121 --> 02:05:49.601
Listen...I'll explain

02:05:49.601 --> 02:05:50.761
The two upstairs rooms are for

02:05:50.761 --> 02:05:52.121
Zhao Ximeng

02:05:52.121 --> 02:05:53.401
and his family

02:05:53.401 --> 02:05:54.401
There are two rooms down here

02:05:54.401 --> 02:05:56.521
Three people are in one of them...

02:05:56.521 --> 02:05:58.081
...all crammed into one bed

02:05:58.801 --> 02:06:00.801
The other is this office

02:06:00.801 --> 02:06:02.641
It's crowded and noisy here
You can't stay here

02:06:02.641 --> 02:06:03.881
And in your condition...

02:06:03.881 --> 02:06:05.081
I insist

02:06:05.921 --> 02:06:07.041
Look...

02:06:07.641 --> 02:06:09.121
I can sleep here

02:06:09.121 --> 02:06:11.641
- No, you can't!
- I can spread some matting here

02:06:11.641 --> 02:06:13.241
- You can't live here!
- Xi Jin!

02:06:13.241 --> 02:06:14.361
No, you can't live here!

02:06:14.361 --> 02:06:15.921
People come and go

02:06:15.921 --> 02:06:16.641
Apart from anything else...

02:06:16.641 --> 02:06:19.081
...you'd be in their way

02:06:20.401 --> 02:06:21.561
Xi Jin!

02:06:21.881 --> 02:06:23.041
Thank you!

02:06:27.561 --> 02:06:28.641
That's how...

02:06:29.561 --> 02:06:31.201
...Xiao Hong

02:06:31.201 --> 02:06:34.321
came to live in our office

02:06:36.401 --> 02:06:40.641
A pregnant woman stretched out on our floor

02:06:42.841 --> 02:06:47.241
As to why Duanmu went first
and left her behind...

02:06:48.081 --> 02:06:49.561
...she didn't say, and I didn't ask

02:07:15.081 --> 02:07:16.161
Xi Jin!

02:07:16.681 --> 02:07:18.641
There's a new café!

02:07:18.641 --> 02:07:20.081
Treat us to iced drinks!

02:07:20.081 --> 02:07:21.561
It's really hot today

02:07:23.681 --> 02:07:25.161
I'm broke!

02:07:25.801 --> 02:07:27.201
If anyone treats, I'll go!

02:07:28.681 --> 02:07:29.961
I have money!

02:07:31.721 --> 02:07:33.241
I have money!

02:07:34.801 --> 02:07:35.961
My treat!

02:07:35.961 --> 02:07:36.761
My treat

02:07:36.761 --> 02:07:38.681
Great!

02:07:44.881 --> 02:07:45.881
You're so late

02:07:45.881 --> 02:07:46.921
Who's treating?

02:07:46.921 --> 02:07:47.921
Xiao Hong...

02:07:48.081 --> 02:07:49.241
Order anything!

02:07:50.921 --> 02:07:52.801
- Miss!
- Here!

02:07:54.601 --> 02:07:55.801
What would you like?

02:07:57.241 --> 02:07:58.401
Whatever you want

02:07:58.401 --> 02:07:59.361
A glass of beer

02:07:59.361 --> 02:08:00.241
All right

02:08:00.241 --> 02:08:01.161
I'll have a beer too

02:08:01.161 --> 02:08:02.401
Shaved ice for me, please

02:08:02.401 --> 02:08:04.161
Help yourself

02:08:05.281 --> 02:08:07.121
your change, $2.7

02:08:07.121 --> 02:08:08.441
Never mind, keep it

02:08:08.801 --> 02:08:09.961
Thank you

02:08:09.961 --> 02:08:11.881
Cheers

02:08:29.601 --> 02:08:30.521
Are you that rich?

02:08:30.521 --> 02:08:32.481
Throwing money around like that!

02:08:32.721 --> 02:08:33.961
Why are you laughing?

02:08:36.521 --> 02:08:38.961
It's all I have, anyway...
it wouldn't help much

02:08:39.081 --> 02:08:40.641
Better spend it generously

02:08:40.841 --> 02:08:41.921
Nonsense!

02:08:41.921 --> 02:08:44.041
Generosity! It made no sense!

02:08:44.241 --> 02:08:45.561
The nation's in crisis

02:08:46.361 --> 02:08:47.721
There's chaos everywhere

02:08:47.921 --> 02:08:49.521
We don't know when Wuhan will fall

02:08:50.161 --> 02:08:51.641
The Japanese Army

02:08:51.641 --> 02:08:53.801
is biding its time

02:08:53.801 --> 02:08:55.001
What will we do if they launch an attack?

02:08:55.001 --> 02:08:57.921
Think about it! What will you do?

02:08:57.921 --> 02:09:00.881
Keeping the change
would have made no difference!

02:09:01.481 --> 02:09:03.401
All right
You have your way, and I have mine

02:09:05.321 --> 02:09:09.401
When crisis hits, I might be across the river

02:09:09.401 --> 02:09:10.841
Unable to help you!

02:09:11.681 --> 02:09:15.641
If that happens, don't worry

02:09:15.921 --> 02:09:18.041
Small change wouldn't help anyway

02:09:20.801 --> 02:09:21.841
Stop blaming me

02:09:27.201 --> 02:09:28.321
You go back first

02:09:28.801 --> 02:09:30.201
There's something I must do

02:09:34.361 --> 02:09:36.921
Don't ask for the money back!

02:10:02.281 --> 02:10:03.721
Get up, get up!

02:10:04.801 --> 02:10:06.401
You finally come back

02:10:06.401 --> 02:10:07.481
Where did you go?

02:10:10.161 --> 02:10:11.721
I borrowed $150 for you

02:10:12.841 --> 02:10:13.961
Listen carefully...

02:10:13.961 --> 02:10:15.361
This is not a gift, it's a loan

02:10:16.241 --> 02:10:18.481
I borrowed $100 from the Life Bookshop

02:10:18.481 --> 02:10:20.561
And another $50 from the Reading Press

02:10:21.361 --> 02:10:24.201
I told them I was borrowing it for you

02:10:24.801 --> 02:10:26.121
And promised you would pay it back

02:10:26.121 --> 02:10:27.721
If you don't, then I will

02:10:32.801 --> 02:10:33.921
What now?

02:10:35.921 --> 02:10:37.201
Keep it

02:10:37.721 --> 02:10:39.041
You'll need it

02:10:39.761 --> 02:10:41.041
No more treating

02:10:47.121 --> 02:10:48.281
I was still worried

02:10:49.121 --> 02:10:51.081
So I asked my colleague Naichao for advice

02:10:51.921 --> 02:10:53.521
I told him

02:10:54.121 --> 02:10:56.041
we couldn't leave Xiao Hong alone in Wuhan

02:10:56.321 --> 02:10:57.361
We had to get her away

02:10:58.601 --> 02:10:59.881
Naichao had an answer

02:11:00.081 --> 02:11:01.441
He said his wife was leaving for Chungking

02:11:01.441 --> 02:11:02.881
She could take Xiao Hong
I said ok

02:11:04.161 --> 02:11:07.121
Not long after,

02:11:07.881 --> 02:11:09.161
I was sent to Canton to start a journal

02:11:09.161 --> 02:11:10.201
I had to leave

02:11:11.801 --> 02:11:15.921
At noon that day,
Xiao Hong and other friends...

02:11:15.921 --> 02:11:17.641
...threw a farewell lunch for me

02:11:17.841 --> 02:11:19.201
And then they saw me off at the pier

02:11:41.201 --> 02:11:42.521
After that, I never saw her again

02:13:16.761 --> 02:13:18.081
Thank you!

02:13:18.081 --> 02:13:19.801
I fell and I couldn't get up

02:13:19.841 --> 02:13:20.841
I'm pregnant

02:13:20.841 --> 02:13:22.961
I've been waiting and waiting

02:13:22.961 --> 02:13:24.041
You're very kind

02:13:24.721 --> 02:13:25.961
Thank you!

02:13:28.801 --> 02:13:31.681
Why are you running
around when you're pregnant?

02:13:35.481 --> 02:13:37.081
Going to Chungking

02:13:41.321 --> 02:13:42.721
Are you all right?

02:13:44.441 --> 02:13:45.561
I'm all right

02:13:48.681 --> 02:13:49.681
Thank you...

02:13:51.041 --> 02:13:52.721
I don't know how to thank you...

02:13:53.921 --> 02:13:55.361
I have money...

02:14:12.361 --> 02:14:15.241
Xiao Hong came to see me when
she reached Chungking

02:14:15.721 --> 02:14:19.161
Back then we lived near the city, in Jiangjin

02:14:20.561 --> 02:14:22.241
She wanted to have the child in Jiangjin

02:14:23.481 --> 02:14:25.161
Duanmu wasn't with her

02:14:26.481 --> 02:14:28.721
<i>For the month she stayed with us...</i>

02:14:29.641 --> 02:14:31.161
<i>...she looked pale</i>

02:14:31.601 --> 02:14:32.641
<i>Sickly...</i>

02:14:33.361 --> 02:14:35.081
<i>Her spirits were low</i>

02:14:40.001 --> 02:14:41.801
The landlady has made chicken soup

02:14:41.801 --> 02:14:43.001
Have some!

02:14:44.081 --> 02:14:45.241
Not now...

02:14:46.241 --> 02:14:47.401
I'm not hungry

02:15:02.201 --> 02:15:03.681
Look at him,

02:15:05.521 --> 02:15:07.481
tiny nose, tiny lips...

02:15:07.481 --> 02:15:09.401
He looks just like Xiao Jun!

02:15:16.561 --> 02:15:18.001
Cute little hand

02:15:48.561 --> 02:15:49.761
What's wrong with you?

02:15:51.801 --> 02:15:53.041
Where have you been?

02:15:56.361 --> 02:15:57.561
Where's the baby?

02:15:59.841 --> 02:16:01.041
Where is he?

02:16:02.441 --> 02:16:03.481
Dead

02:16:05.321 --> 02:16:06.481
What?

02:16:08.081 --> 02:16:11.081
He was fine yesterday, how can he be dead?

02:16:12.001 --> 02:16:13.281
I'll get the doctor

02:16:13.281 --> 02:16:15.961
Don't go

02:16:16.761 --> 02:16:20.561
Please don't

02:16:22.001 --> 02:16:23.441
There's no point

02:16:24.081 --> 02:16:26.361
He died of convulsions last night

02:16:30.121 --> 02:16:33.441
Bai Lang...

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:35.161
I want to be discharged

02:16:35.561 --> 02:16:37.241
Right now. I'm so scared

02:16:37.241 --> 02:16:40.001
There was only one doctor on duty last night

02:16:40.241 --> 02:16:42.960
I'm the only patient left in here

02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:49.361
Take me away

02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:58.960
Bai Lang...I hope you'll always be happy

02:17:02.361 --> 02:17:04.001
You too!

02:17:05.281 --> 02:17:06.361
Me?

02:17:10.001 --> 02:17:11.281
Can I be happy?

02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:18.321
I know my own future

02:17:19.561 --> 02:17:21.321
I'll be lonely all my life

02:18:00.641 --> 02:18:03.281
<i>"Mr Lu Xun was recovering"</i>

02:18:03.561 --> 02:18:06.001
<i>"He sat, smoking, in his reclining chair"</i>

02:18:06.521 --> 02:18:07.841
<i>"That day..."</i>

02:18:07.841 --> 02:18:12.401
<i>was wearing a garish red blouse"</i>

02:18:12.721 --> 02:18:14.521
<i>"Mr Lu Xun said..."</i>

02:18:14.521 --> 02:18:16.521
<i>"The heat is oppressive today"</i>

02:18:16.761 --> 02:18:18.601
<i>"They call this the 'plum rain season'..."</i>

02:18:19.561 --> 02:18:22.561
<i>"He was putting a cigarette"</i>

02:18:22.561 --> 02:18:25.081
<i>"in his cigarette-holder..."</i>

02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.321
Mr Lu Xun...

02:18:31.441 --> 02:18:33.721
What do you think of my outfit today?

02:18:39.161 --> 02:18:40.321
Am I pretty

02:18:41.161 --> 02:18:42.761
Not so pretty

02:18:44.161 --> 02:18:45.361
Why not?

02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:49.040
You're wearing the wrong skirt

02:18:50.241 --> 02:18:52.721
There is nothing wrong with a red blouse

02:18:53.401 --> 02:18:55.921
Any color can look good...

02:18:58.001 --> 02:19:00.841
But a red blouse needs a red skirt

02:19:00.841 --> 02:19:03.120
Or a black one

02:19:04.841 --> 02:19:06.200
Miss Xiao!

02:19:07.241 --> 02:19:08.681
Mr Duanmu!

02:19:09.361 --> 02:19:11.040
Miss Xiao!

02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:12.521
Mr Duanmu!

02:19:13.081 --> 02:19:14.120
Mr Jin!

02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:15.200
I've brought them rice

02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:16.281
What should I do?

02:19:16.521 --> 02:19:18.241
They don't live here any more

02:19:18.241 --> 02:19:19.641
Keep the rice for yourself

02:19:19.841 --> 02:19:21.281
How come?

02:19:21.281 --> 02:19:22.521
They've moved to Hong Kong

02:19:38.441 --> 02:19:39.601
Come in

02:19:43.561 --> 02:19:45.241
- Xiao Hong...
- Xiao Hong!

02:19:48.361 --> 02:19:49.961
What a surprise!

02:19:49.961 --> 02:19:51.201
Xiao Gu...

02:19:51.201 --> 02:19:52.401
Look who's here!

02:19:53.201 --> 02:19:54.241
Say "Auntie"

02:19:54.241 --> 02:19:56.201
- He's grown
- Yes

02:19:56.201 --> 02:19:57.321
Thinner,

02:19:58.241 --> 02:19:59.561
Taller too

02:20:00.961 --> 02:20:03.081
Come here...Look at our baby girl

02:20:04.121 --> 02:20:05.841
She put me through it!

02:20:06.401 --> 02:20:08.561
Just as well we didn't abort her in Wuhan

02:20:08.561 --> 02:20:09.921
Or you wouldn't be here now!

02:20:09.921 --> 02:20:11.241
What happened to her forehead?

02:20:11.521 --> 02:20:12.921
It was a rat

02:20:13.441 --> 02:20:15.241
It must have been hungry

02:20:15.241 --> 02:20:18.081
It nibbled her

02:20:18.081 --> 02:20:19.481
It's all right

02:20:23.641 --> 02:20:25.281
She looks so delicate...

02:20:25.281 --> 02:20:26.761
...and pretty, just like you

02:20:26.761 --> 02:20:27.841
Like me?

02:20:27.841 --> 02:20:29.001
Not like her dad!

02:20:30.281 --> 02:20:31.401
Xiao Hong...

02:20:31.401 --> 02:20:33.401
I have something to do, I must go out

02:20:33.401 --> 02:20:34.641
Of course

02:20:34.641 --> 02:20:36.321
I'll take the boy. You go on

02:20:36.321 --> 02:20:38.561
Son, take it with you

02:20:38.561 --> 02:20:39.601
Give it to me

02:20:45.401 --> 02:20:46.481
Bye

02:20:48.001 --> 02:20:49.081
Do sit down

02:20:50.521 --> 02:20:51.761
Such a mess!

02:20:57.841 --> 02:20:58.801
What about your baby?

02:20:58.801 --> 02:21:00.201
It must be big by now

02:21:02.881 --> 02:21:03.921
It died

02:21:05.681 --> 02:21:07.321
Three days after it was born

02:21:08.521 --> 02:21:10.161
How did it die?

02:21:11.881 --> 02:21:13.281
Was it a boy or a girl?

02:21:15.081 --> 02:21:16.321
A boy

02:21:16.321 --> 02:21:17.641
He died of convulsions

02:21:19.361 --> 02:21:22.081
I fell down on the pier in Yichang

02:21:22.921 --> 02:21:24.001
I found myself thinking...

02:21:24.961 --> 02:21:26.401
Child...

02:21:26.921 --> 02:21:28.081
If you want to drop...

02:21:28.721 --> 02:21:30.041
Drop out of my body

02:21:31.401 --> 02:21:33.081
I can't hold on to you

02:21:34.041 --> 02:21:35.601
But he survived that fine

02:21:40.321 --> 02:21:41.721
You've fleshed out a bit

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:44.441
You look good!

02:21:44.761 --> 02:21:45.881
Really!

02:21:46.281 --> 02:21:48.121
You look beautiful in that dress

02:21:48.121 --> 02:21:51.321
I was stunned when you came in wearing it

02:21:53.201 --> 02:21:55.041
I made it myself

02:21:55.041 --> 02:21:57.321
I bought the cloth, the thread

02:21:57.321 --> 02:21:59.561
and the buttons at the market

02:22:00.401 --> 02:22:01.881
Look

02:22:02.441 --> 02:22:04.761
The result isn't too bad, is it?

02:22:05.121 --> 02:22:06.961
It's elegant, it suits you

02:22:06.961 --> 02:22:08.761
I always said

02:22:08.961 --> 02:22:11.161
you have really good taste

02:22:11.761 --> 02:22:14.321
You can turn any piece of cheap fabric...

02:22:14.441 --> 02:22:16.881
...into the most beautiful dress!

02:22:18.081 --> 02:22:20.201
If you like, I'll make one for you

02:22:20.641 --> 02:22:22.841
I don't have the energy these days

02:22:25.041 --> 02:22:27.241
Hey, I must show you something!

02:22:35.881 --> 02:22:39.361
This came from Xiao Jun, his wedding photo

02:22:56.561 --> 02:22:57.681
I'm going

02:22:58.321 --> 02:22:59.961
Give my best to Hu when he gets back

02:22:59.961 --> 02:23:01.121
Xiao Hong...

02:23:10.321 --> 02:23:12.281
ZHOU JINGWEN magazine publisher

02:23:12.281 --> 02:23:13.161
A year after...

02:23:13.161 --> 02:23:14.681
...they arrived in Hong Kong...

02:23:15.441 --> 02:23:16.761
...Xiao Hong was...

02:23:16.761 --> 02:23:18.081
...diagnosed with tuberculosis

02:23:19.561 --> 02:23:21.361
While she was in the hospital...

02:23:21.361 --> 02:23:23.761
...Duanmu took a call from a stranger

02:23:24.521 --> 02:23:25.921
A man named Luo Binji

02:23:26.681 --> 02:23:28.561
He claimed to be a friend
of Xiao Hong's brother

02:23:30.961 --> 02:23:32.281
He was stuck in a hotel

02:23:32.281 --> 02:23:33.601
Looking for work

02:23:34.081 --> 02:23:35.441
Duanmu turned to me

02:23:37.961 --> 02:23:39.761
You've been home for a few days...

02:23:39.921 --> 02:23:41.441
You should go back to hospital

02:23:43.561 --> 02:23:45.841
This isn't a good environment for you

02:23:46.601 --> 02:23:48.041
Don't be too willful

02:23:49.761 --> 02:23:51.281
I'd rather die than go back

02:23:51.281 --> 02:23:52.401
I was bored stiff there

02:23:52.401 --> 02:23:54.001
They wouldn't even let me write

02:23:55.361 --> 02:23:57.081
It's a matter of priorities

02:24:03.921 --> 02:24:05.161
Mr Zhou...

02:24:09.561 --> 02:24:14.521
I'm not sure I can finish my novel
<i>Ma Bole</i>...

02:24:19.841 --> 02:24:22.721
Can you announce that I'm ill in the magazine?

02:24:23.481 --> 02:24:24.681
As excuse

02:24:26.001 --> 02:24:27.401
A famous woman writer...

02:24:28.921 --> 02:24:31.441
...confined to a shabby, old bed

02:24:32.201 --> 02:24:33.561
The whole scene...

02:24:34.521 --> 02:24:36.121
...made me feel really sad

02:24:40.441 --> 02:24:42.281
Soon after that, without warning...

02:24:42.561 --> 02:24:46.081
...the Pacific War began on December 7th

02:24:47.321 --> 02:24:48.801
By Luo Binji's own account...

02:24:49.561 --> 02:24:52.881
...he was with Xiao Hong in her final days

02:24:56.041 --> 02:24:57.721
Five years later...

02:25:00.081 --> 02:25:02.721
...he was the first
to write a biography of her

02:25:11.641 --> 02:25:14.681
The Japanese began shelling
Hong Kong on December 8th, 1941

02:25:14.681 --> 02:25:17.441
That day I went to say goodbye

02:25:17.441 --> 02:25:18.721
before returning to the mainland

02:25:21.841 --> 02:25:23.121
You're intent on leaving?

02:25:29.041 --> 02:25:30.401
I'll be back soon

02:25:33.561 --> 02:25:35.201
I came to say goodbye

02:25:35.201 --> 02:25:36.561
I'm going back to China

02:25:36.881 --> 02:25:38.841
I have to go...

02:25:38.841 --> 02:25:41.161
to discuss if we should leave too

02:25:41.161 --> 02:25:42.761
Please stay here a while

02:25:42.761 --> 02:25:44.161
I'll be back soon

02:26:07.561 --> 02:26:08.881
I'm so tired...

02:26:11.281 --> 02:26:12.721
Hold my hand

02:26:13.361 --> 02:26:14.721
I want to take a nap

02:26:16.921 --> 02:26:18.761
I feel much better...

02:26:23.761 --> 02:26:25.801
<i>Apparently, just before I arrived...</i>

02:26:25.801 --> 02:26:29.041
<i>...Duanmu and Xiao Hong</i>

02:26:29.041 --> 02:26:30.721
<i>had been having a bitter row</i>

02:26:32.441 --> 02:26:33.441
Wake up!

02:26:35.841 --> 02:26:38.681
<i>Mr Yu Yifu had arranged a boat...</i>

02:26:39.001 --> 02:26:41.681
<i>...to get us to Hong Kong island,
not yet occupied by the Japanese</i>

02:26:42.521 --> 02:26:43.921
<i>Sea traffic</i>

02:26:43.921 --> 02:26:46.041
<i>is now officially blocked</i>

02:28:27.081 --> 02:28:29.921
Has our retreat been worked out?

02:28:31.401 --> 02:28:32.561
My colleague Liao

02:28:32.561 --> 02:28:35.841
has divided all the cultural people into groups

02:28:36.641 --> 02:28:38.241
He's explained our plans

02:28:38.241 --> 02:28:39.721
And has specified who will lead each group

02:28:40.481 --> 02:28:43.601
You and Xiao Hong are in my group

02:28:50.521 --> 02:28:53.761
...so I'm afraid you have no choice
but to stay

02:29:03.001 --> 02:29:04.281
Luo Binji...

02:29:06.961 --> 02:29:08.601
Before you met me...

02:29:09.321 --> 02:29:11.441
...did you think that

02:29:12.641 --> 02:29:15.281
I was a writer with loose morals?

02:29:20.521 --> 02:29:22.321
I think everyone has heard a little about...

02:29:22.321 --> 02:29:24.921
...your troubles with Xiao Jun

02:29:37.601 --> 02:29:38.801
So, before you met me...

02:29:38.801 --> 02:29:42.361
...you sided with Xiao Jun?

02:29:49.521 --> 02:29:50.641
I know very well...

02:29:52.721 --> 02:29:54.561
...that leaving Xiao Jun...

02:29:55.881 --> 02:29:57.961
...solved one problem

02:30:01.681 --> 02:30:05.321
And that Duanmu was the start
of another problem

02:30:06.481 --> 02:30:11.121
Probably, everybody wears disguises

02:30:13.721 --> 02:30:18.241
Nobody ever shows their true face

02:30:21.081 --> 02:30:22.321
I've been thinking...

02:30:27.881 --> 02:30:32.681
I can't tell if anyone will read my stuff later

02:30:34.721 --> 02:30:36.201
But I'm quite sure...

02:30:39.121 --> 02:30:44.801
...that the gossip about me will go on and on

02:30:50.881 --> 02:30:53.801
<i>As we chatted that morning,
I asked Xiao Hong...</i>

02:30:54.281 --> 02:30:57.321
<i>How could you live with Duanmu
for three or four years?</i>

02:30:58.241 --> 02:30:59.521
<i>Xiao Hong replied...</i>

02:31:00.121 --> 02:31:02.281
If the pain is in the marrow...

02:31:04.081 --> 02:31:10.281
...you don't worry about the flesh wounds

02:31:23.081 --> 02:31:28.681
He cannot endure the hardships with me

02:31:38.681 --> 02:31:40.361
When I was in Sichuan...

02:31:41.481 --> 02:31:43.321
...I found myself thinking of Xiao Jun

02:31:46.201 --> 02:31:51.321
If I'd sent him a telegram...

02:31:52.081 --> 02:31:53.521
...asking him to come...

02:31:54.201 --> 02:31:56.001
...he would have been there for me

02:31:58.281 --> 02:32:00.161
<i>Amid the sound of artillery shells...</i>

02:32:00.161 --> 02:32:01.561
<i>...we talked about literature...</i>

02:32:01.561 --> 02:32:02.721
<i>About Lu Xun...</i>

02:32:02.721 --> 02:32:04.681
<i>About living through such hard times</i>

02:32:05.641 --> 02:32:07.641
<i>We hadn't seen Duanmu for three or four days</i>

02:32:20.361 --> 02:32:21.441
You're back!

02:32:43.761 --> 02:32:45.481
You haven't left?

02:34:00.641 --> 02:34:01.961
Sorry...Thank you

02:34:07.401 --> 02:34:09.001
Sorry...Thank you, thank you

02:34:32.521 --> 02:34:33.281
Good bye

02:34:33.281 --> 02:34:35.601
<i>On Christmas Day of 1941,</i>

02:34:35.921 --> 02:34:37.841
<i>Hong Kong fell to the Japanese</i>

02:34:38.521 --> 02:34:40.961
<i>After hiding for some days in a storeroom...</i>

02:34:41.201 --> 02:34:42.961
<i>...Xiao Hong's condition worsened</i>

02:34:43.201 --> 02:34:45.721
<i>Duanmu and I sent her to a hospital</i>

02:34:57.081 --> 02:34:58.321
Considering what's going on around us...

02:34:58.321 --> 02:34:59.241
I told Duanmu

02:34:59.241 --> 02:35:00.441
...I'll be frank

02:35:00.961 --> 02:35:02.561
You're both famous artists

02:35:02.561 --> 02:35:03.761
You have open minds

02:35:05.121 --> 02:35:06.881
You have a tumor in your throat

02:35:06.881 --> 02:35:08.081
We need to operate

02:35:12.321 --> 02:35:13.961
I won't agree to an operation

02:35:15.001 --> 02:35:18.201
A tuberculosis patient won't recover from it

02:35:18.921 --> 02:35:20.681
My brother had spinal tuberculosis...

02:35:20.681 --> 02:35:22.881
And he didn't recover from an operation

02:35:23.081 --> 02:35:25.001
Who do you believe? Me? Or him?

02:35:30.521 --> 02:35:31.961
Don't pussyfoot around

02:35:33.361 --> 02:35:36.361
It's not the end of the world

02:35:37.001 --> 02:35:38.081
Sign the consent

02:35:39.081 --> 02:35:40.161
I won't

02:35:48.561 --> 02:35:49.761
If you won't, I will

02:36:34.361 --> 02:36:35.441
What did she say?

02:36:36.961 --> 02:36:38.441
There was no tumor

02:37:01.721 --> 02:37:03.081
Don't cry

02:37:10.561 --> 02:37:15.241
I don't want...

02:37:23.401 --> 02:37:25.601
...to leave you either

02:37:33.721 --> 02:37:35.001
Come with me...

02:37:44.241 --> 02:37:45.881
I'll contact Queen Mary Hospital

02:37:59.681 --> 02:38:02.161
<i>At noon on January 18th, 1942...</i>

02:38:02.761 --> 02:38:04.761
<i>...Xiao Hong was moved
to Queen Mary Hospital</i>

02:39:19.601 --> 02:39:24.361
I feel quite all right

02:39:27.121 --> 02:39:28.561
I've eaten a lot

02:39:56.081 --> 02:39:57.401
Luo Binji...

02:39:58.801 --> 02:40:00.161
Have a cigarette

02:40:00.761 --> 02:40:02.041
Have one

02:40:03.401 --> 02:40:04.521
I won't

02:40:05.121 --> 02:40:06.001
It's all right

02:40:06.001 --> 02:40:07.121
I don't want one

02:40:08.481 --> 02:40:09.761
No light?

02:40:10.281 --> 02:40:11.441
I'll call for one

02:40:13.281 --> 02:40:14.841
All right, all right

02:40:14.841 --> 02:40:15.961
Call the nurse

02:40:16.721 --> 02:40:18.241
Don't exert yourself

02:40:18.241 --> 02:40:19.361
It's done

02:40:20.121 --> 02:40:22.561
Wait, the nurse will come

02:40:23.801 --> 02:40:25.521
There's nobody in the whole hospital

02:40:27.281 --> 02:40:28.561
I'll go and buy matches

02:40:37.641 --> 02:40:41.041
<i>I intended to buy matches from a street-stall</i>

02:40:41.441 --> 02:40:43.241
<i>But as I wandered downtown, it struck me...</i>

02:40:43.841 --> 02:40:47.761
<i>...that I hadn't been back to Kowloon
since the city was occupied</i>

02:40:48.201 --> 02:40:49.881
<i>Duanmu was with Xiao Hong</i>

02:40:49.881 --> 02:40:51.521
<i>And she seemed better that day</i>

02:40:52.041 --> 02:40:53.961
<i>So I went home to pick up my manuscripts</i>

02:41:15.481 --> 02:41:17.961
<i>I went back to Queen Mary Hospital
next morning...</i>

02:41:18.281 --> 02:41:20.281
<i>...to find that the Japanese
had taken it over</i>

02:41:31.041 --> 02:41:33.161
<i>So I rushed back to the storeroom...</i>

02:41:33.441 --> 02:41:35.441
<i>...and there found
a note Duanmu had left for me</i>

02:41:36.001 --> 02:41:38.361
<i>Duanmu had taken Xiao Hong
to the French Hospital...</i>

02:41:49.481 --> 02:41:52.161
The Japanese have taken the French Hospital too

02:41:52.161 --> 02:41:53.201
Where's Xiao Hong?

02:41:53.201 --> 02:41:55.321
They've set up a clinic
at St Stephen's Girls College

02:43:02.961 --> 02:43:06.321
<i>"My grandfather lived in the little town
on the Hulan River”</i>

02:43:06.321 --> 02:43:09.881
<i>"Grandfather was over sixty when I was born"</i>

02:43:10.121 --> 02:43:13.881
<i>"He was nearly seventy by the time
I was four or five"</i>

02:43:15.081 --> 02:43:17.161
<i>"Our house had a big garden"</i>

02:43:17.161 --> 02:43:21.401
<i>"The garden was bright
with all the reds and greens"</i>

02:43:21.401 --> 02:43:24.401
<i>"Flowers bloomed as if they were waking up"</i>

02:43:24.841 --> 02:43:27.721
<i>"Birds flew as if they were going up
to heaven"</i>

02:43:28.041 --> 02:43:31.921
<i>”When insects buzzed,
it was as if they were chatting"</i>

02:43:32.241 --> 02:43:33.881
<i>Everything was alive</i>

02:43:34.241 --> 02:43:35.921
<i>"There was no limit to what they could do"</i>

02:43:36.361 --> 02:43:38.601
<i>"They had complete freedom"</i>

02:43:38.761 --> 02:43:42.521
<i>"to do what they liked"</i>

02:43:43.481 --> 02:43:46.881
<i>"If a plant wanted
to bear a fruit, it did so”</i>

02:43:47.161 --> 02:43:48.841
<i>"If it didn't,"</i>

02:43:48.841 --> 02:43:52.681
<i>"then not one fruit, not even a blossom"</i>

02:43:53.081 --> 02:43:54.561
<i>"And no-one could object"</i>

02:43:55.161 --> 02:43:58.481
<i>"But this back garden
was sealed off once each year”</i>

02:43:59.081 --> 02:44:02.721
<i>”After the autumnal rains,
it would languish"</i>

02:44:03.361 --> 02:44:06.001
<i>”The flowers would yellow and fall,</i> ”

02:44:06.201 --> 02:44:09.641
<i>"then wither and die"</i>

02:44:10.161 --> 02:44:13.361
<i>"Almost as if someone was crushing them"</i>

02:44:15.441 --> 02:44:18.321
<i>"Spring, summer, autumn, winter..."</i>

02:44:18.321 --> 02:44:21.241
<i>"The seasonal cycle goes on</i>

02:44:21.961 --> 02:44:23.961
<i>"just as it has since the beginning of time"</i>

02:44:24.961 --> 02:44:26.761
<i>"Wind, frost, rain, snow..."</i>

02:44:27.801 --> 02:44:30.881
<i>"Those who can bear up manage to survive"</i>

02:44:30.881 --> 02:44:34.361
<i>”Those who cannot must take
the natural way out"</i>

02:44:34.601 --> 02:44:37.641
<i>"That natural way out is not so very good"</i>

02:44:38.441 --> 02:44:41.121
<i>"For such people are quietly..."</i>

02:44:41.441 --> 02:44:43.201
<i>"Wordlessly. . . "</i>

02:44:43.201 --> 02:44:46.801
<i>"...removed from this life and this world"</i>

02:44:59.121 --> 02:45:02.561
Xiao Hong wrote <i>Tales of Hulan River</i>
in 1941...

02:45:02.961 --> 02:45:04.681
...at a time when most Chinese writers...

02:45:04.681 --> 02:45:07.081
...were producing writings contributing

02:45:07.321 --> 02:45:10.841
to the anti-Japanese war effort

02:45:12.121 --> 02:45:15.761
<i>Tales of Hulan River</i> didn't meet
the needs of the time

02:45:16.721 --> 02:45:19.081
All these decades later,

02:45:20.041 --> 02:45:22.681
now that we're far from China in wartime...

02:45:23.001 --> 02:45:25.961
...people have discovered that
<i>Tales of Hulan River</i>...

02:45:25.961 --> 02:45:29.201
...is like an undying flower
which had been buried by history

02:45:29.481 --> 02:45:32.681
This choice that she made for herself...

02:45:32.961 --> 02:45:38.721
...had made her name immortal

02:45:50.521 --> 02:45:54.201
<i>"These tales I've written
are not all beautiful”</i>

02:45:55.201 --> 02:45:58.641
<i>"But these memories fill me"</i>

02:46:00.121 --> 02:46:01.681
<i>"I cannot forget them"</i>

02:46:02.161 --> 02:46:03.761
<i>"They stay with me"</i>

02:46:05.281 --> 02:46:06.881
<i>"And so I have recorded them here"</i>

02:46:26.601 --> 02:46:28.361
Hey, feller, the candies are two cents,
