Send the coordinates

03:26.760 --> 03:29.730
18°28'37"N

03:30.760 --> 03:33.650
123°19'3"E

03:33.880 --> 03:35.006
Yes, Boss

03:37.760 --> 03:39.922
18°28'37"N

03:40.040 --> 03:43.123
123°19'3"E

04:13.240 --> 04:14.082
Pull!

05:03.840 --> 05:06.764
My doctor told me to stop sailing
because of my heart condition.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.604
From now on,
I'll give you the coordinates by phone.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.209
Once you two get the hang of things...

05:15.040 --> 05:17.361
Boss Kui will send
the coordinates directly to Sheng

05:18.280 --> 05:21.363
I can then retire for good.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.050
Take good care of my son

05:25.880 --> 05:26.879
I'm leaving...

05:26.880 --> 05:28.291
the business to him.

05:40.920 --> 05:41.762
Fine.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.369
You're like a son to me

05:44.680 --> 05:46.808
I'll give you a bigger cut.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.242
Sheng!

06:22.880 --> 06:24.609
"Inspector Accused of Murder

06:24.640 --> 06:26.404
and Manslaughter of Fellow Officer".

06:35.800 --> 06:36.847
Serving time...

06:37.920 --> 06:39.570
won't bring the dead back to life.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.047
Regrets...

06:47.280 --> 06:48.850
won't help the families of the victims.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.847
Once I get out

06:53.680 --> 06:56.286
I'll hunt down the criminals like a dog

06:57.120 --> 06:58.724
lives will be saved.

07:21.360 --> 07:24.728
Due to lack of evidence the accused,
Chang Hao-dong is acquitted of all charges

07:25.000 --> 07:30.006
six months later.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.007
Your mail.

07:51.760 --> 07:52.886
You've turned 18...

07:53.880 --> 07:57.168
my legal guardianship
of you officially ended.

07:58.440 --> 07:59.726
Living expenses will be deposited...

08:00.680 --> 08:01.727
into your account.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.524
No need to see me each month.

08:26.360 --> 08:27.646
Did you become my guardian...

08:29.080 --> 08:30.320
because you killed my father?

08:31.760 --> 08:33.091
Your father was a criminal.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.802
He resisted arrest and fell to his death.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.405
It was an accident

08:38.520 --> 08:39.601
I did nothing wrong.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.121
But I wanted to help your family.

08:42.919 --> 08:44.331
What your father did was wrong

08:44.920 --> 08:46.410
I never considered him my father.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.165
That doesn't concern me.

08:54.160 --> 08:54.843
Hello.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.242
Sai Gau, you're such a pain!

08:57.280 --> 08:58.520
My boss already suspects me.

08:58.680 --> 08:59.841
This is the last time!

09:00.000 --> 09:02.523
A contraband shipment arrives
at Ma Wan Village tonight.

09:02.524 --> 09:04.045
You go and check it out.

09:20.720 --> 09:21.607
Sir

09:22.000 --> 09:22.887
I quit.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.961
Did I treat you badly?

09:32.320 --> 09:33.446
Want a transfer instead?

09:35.360 --> 09:38.170
I've always wanted to go to Europe.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.807
Sai Gau know?

09:42.680 --> 09:43.886
Well...

09:44.720 --> 09:45.801
I'll tell him later.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.525
No one wants to be his partner.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.245
A-de, let's go.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.806
Where are your manners?

09:56.400 --> 09:57.401
You dyed your hair!

09:59.840 --> 10:00.887
Are you a gangster now?

10:02.200 --> 10:03.361
What do you care...

10:04.760 --> 10:06.410
as long as I do my job?

10:07.200 --> 10:09.407
You were only promoted
because you have a degree.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.086
Have you ever...

10:12.120 --> 10:12.962
solved a case?

10:15.200 --> 10:16.884
What are you doing? Move!

10:17.120 --> 10:18.360
I've resigned.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.647
Resigned?

10:21.080 --> 10:21.888
When?

10:22.240 --> 10:23.162
Just now.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.963
Today is my last day,
considering my unused annual leave.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.727
That means before midnight tonight...

10:33.880 --> 10:34.961
you're still a cop.

10:35.000 --> 10:35.569
Yes...

10:35.640 --> 10:36.527
Let's go!

10:36.680 --> 10:37.283
Where to?

10:38.200 --> 10:39.770
To have tea?

10:39.880 --> 10:41.723
Fine, just don't cause trouble

10:41.840 --> 10:43.205
I can't save your ass again.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.009
Alright, I heard you.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.886
There are cops at the pier, can't dock.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.090
The old man said that!

11:10.040 --> 11:10.927
Yes.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.050
Hello?

11:21.680 --> 11:22.602
Go to Ma Wan Village

11:25.000 --> 11:26.365
I said Ma Wan Village!

11:26.960 --> 11:27.882
Are you deaf?

12:12.080 --> 12:14.208
Remember the time we
both fell into the sea?

12:15.040 --> 12:18.965
My old man saved me but left you to drown.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.524
They say...

12:21.920 --> 12:24.002
blood is thicker than water.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.244
But I think he knew...

12:27.680 --> 12:29.762
you could save yourself

12:31.360 --> 12:33.442
I may have inherited the business.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.045
But I still think...

12:36.960 --> 12:38.564
unless you disappear...

12:39.520 --> 12:41.249
no one will treat me like the boss.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.648
Did the old man want me dead?

13:03.880 --> 13:04.529
<i>Sad Gau.</i>

13:18.360 --> 13:20.727
Are you sure they're your men?

13:24.600 --> 13:25.647
What are you doing?

13:26.160 --> 13:27.047
Don't be stupid!

13:27.920 --> 13:29.570
Your men were under surveillance

13:32.200 --> 13:34.009
I had them all killed

13:34.360 --> 13:35.521
I have an army of men

13:35.560 --> 13:36.641
they'll be here soon!

13:39.800 --> 13:40.847
Our location is Ma Wan Village.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.201
Multiple dead bodies, send backup.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.930
If you didn't act it out

13:50.720 --> 13:52.165
I wouldn't have declared war.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.001
Because we all worship the Sea Goddess.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.729
That time I fell into the sea

14:01.280 --> 14:02.406
I thought I was dead

14:03.240 --> 14:05.129
I looked up at the sky...

14:07.120 --> 14:08.645
and saw the Sea Goddess

14:09.360 --> 14:11.089
I suddenly realized...

14:11.720 --> 14:12.801
she would protect me...

14:28.320 --> 14:29.924
You wanted me dead.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.082
But she wanted me to rise up.

14:33.520 --> 14:34.646
You're crazy!

14:39.840 --> 14:42.047
Gui-cheng, we're brothers

14:42.240 --> 14:43.969
I don't care about the money

14:44.920 --> 14:46.809
I can give up the business too.

14:47.920 --> 14:48.569
It's all yours

14:48.640 --> 14:49.880
I'll tell the old man...

14:50.760 --> 14:51.807
I'm just a fisherman

14:51.840 --> 14:52.564
like you...

14:52.565 --> 14:53.686
I worship the Sea Goddess.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.330
You're not me.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.771
We grew up together!

15:00.880 --> 15:02.086
We're brothers!

17:42.200 --> 17:43.440
All unmarked...

17:43.840 --> 17:45.171
likely black market gold.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.370
Smuggled in by fishermen

17:48.400 --> 17:49.731
the source shouldn't be far.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.328
A fishing ban is in
effect, no boats go out.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.683
Let's talk to the punks,
they may know something.

18:36.440 --> 18:37.680
Take her away.

19:09.880 --> 19:10.927
Stop!

21:02.120 --> 21:03.690
Who's smuggling gold?

21:04.600 --> 21:05.965
Who's smuggling gold?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.001
I don't know!

21:11.160 --> 21:14.243
I just know Shui's crew
often sails out at night.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.041
Save him!

21:53.720 --> 21:54.323
Sheng!

21:54.760 --> 21:55.409
Sheng!

21:55.880 --> 21:58.770
Get a towel! He's freezing!

22:07.040 --> 22:08.451
Gut him.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.081
You dare?

22:13.080 --> 22:13.922
Jiang Gui-cheng

22:14.640 --> 22:15.926
I didn't kill you

22:16.240 --> 22:17.401
I failed.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.042
The business is yours.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.611
Don't hurt my son!

22:22.880 --> 22:24.564
Gut him.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.042
Do it!

22:38.680 --> 22:40.648
Jiang, stop!

22:42.240 --> 22:43.321
Do it!

23:09.760 --> 23:11.330
If you loved your son

23:12.360 --> 23:14.249
you shouldn't have told him to kill me.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.330
You were...

23:17.680 --> 23:19.330
too selfish.

23:33.280 --> 23:34.930
Where is the transmitter?

23:35.360 --> 23:37.966
Monster, go to hell!

23:51.040 --> 23:53.202
I just want to do business with Boss Kui

24:29.680 --> 24:31.011
I'm an ordinary fisherman

24:31.360 --> 24:33.408
I don't know anything about smuggling.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.569
No matter how many times you ask...

24:37.240 --> 24:38.526
my answer will be the same!

24:46.520 --> 24:48.648
Do you know how your son died?

24:50.720 --> 24:52.051
Excessive blood loss.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.371
That means he was conscious...

24:55.680 --> 24:57.887
while he was being tortured.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.601
He felt the pain of every cut.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.970
What did he do wrong?

25:04.560 --> 25:05.846
How could anyone be so cruel?

25:09.440 --> 25:11.169
Perhaps you're responsible...

25:11.640 --> 25:13.244
for his death?

25:17.760 --> 25:19.205
If I were you...

25:20.640 --> 25:22.404
I'd use every means possible...

25:22.720 --> 25:24.563
to avenge my son's death.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.362
Officer Chang.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.048
Step outside

25:34.160 --> 25:35.889
I said step outside!

25:45.120 --> 25:46.770
I can help you catch him...

25:46.920 --> 25:47.807
even kill him.

25:49.040 --> 25:49.802
Enough!

25:51.120 --> 25:52.451
Didn't I say no visitors.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.526
Sorry, Sir.

25:55.440 --> 25:56.851
Filing a complaint?

26:08.880 --> 26:10.291
Recklessness won't solve this

26:10.960 --> 26:12.086
I'm warning you...

26:12.280 --> 26:13.406
don't touch the witness!

26:13.560 --> 26:16.086
My recklessness helped catch the witness.

26:16.320 --> 26:18.243
You know nothing about the front lines.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.170
You sit in your cozy office...

26:20.240 --> 26:22.242
filling out paperwork all day long

26:22.600 --> 26:24.807
while we get our hands dirty

26:26.840 --> 26:27.966
I stay in the office...

26:28.200 --> 26:30.089
devising the best strategy.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.285
Your actions...

26:34.000 --> 26:35.286
got two people killed.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.047
It was an accident!

26:37.080 --> 26:38.127
Who believes you?

26:39.200 --> 26:40.361
Your recklessness endangered...

26:40.400 --> 26:42.129
the lives of your colleagues.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.206
Do it again...

26:49.680 --> 26:51.125
I'll personally file a complaint

26:52.840 --> 26:54.285
I'm doing my job.

26:54.640 --> 26:55.971
You can't stop me.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.646
Fine.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.650
Watch me stop you.

27:03.560 --> 27:04.641
Instead of criminals...

27:04.680 --> 27:06.045
you target your own people.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.248
Know what they call you behind your back?

27:10.880 --> 27:12.450
Desk Cop!

27:25.920 --> 27:26.842
It's late,

27:27.040 --> 27:27.689
What's up?

27:28.520 --> 27:30.124
Let's drink till we drop

27:32.200 --> 27:34.521
I can't, my girlfriend's here.

27:34.680 --> 27:35.886
So?

27:38.800 --> 27:39.881
Having a shag?

27:41.120 --> 27:42.451
Take a break.

27:42.520 --> 27:43.931
No...

27:43.960 --> 27:44.802
What?

27:48.800 --> 27:49.722
Brother

27:50.360 --> 27:53.682
I'm flying off to Europe tomorrow morning

27:54.040 --> 27:55.326
Europe?

27:55.680 --> 27:56.647
The gold smuggling investigation...

27:56.680 --> 27:58.250
isn't over.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.606
Shut up

28:02.880 --> 28:05.042
I've turned in my badge!

28:05.280 --> 28:06.964
Didn't you hear me?

28:07.400 --> 28:08.367
Are you senile?

28:08.960 --> 28:10.928
Yesterday was my last day!

28:11.360 --> 28:12.805
I quit

28:17.680 --> 28:18.966
I can't help you.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.644
That's right, I forgot

28:35.440 --> 28:36.327
I'll be fine.

28:37.800 --> 28:38.608
Have fun.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.885
Behave yourself

28:44.520 --> 28:46.249
I'll buy you both dinner when you return.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.361
Sai Gau...

29:01.600 --> 29:03.090
Tell that blonde cop

29:03.160 --> 29:05.731
I'm going to have diarrhea at 4am

29:10.240 --> 29:11.890
I'm Chen Shut-sheng's lawyer.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.762
My client will meet you...

29:12.800 --> 29:14.529
in the custodial ward toilet at 4am.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.043
The man you want is Jiang Gui-cheng.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.129
His crew meets with him at noon each day...

30:01.400 --> 30:03.641
to hand over money from extortion
at Jordan Wet Market.

30:11.280 --> 30:11.849
Hello, this is A-de

30:11.880 --> 30:13.723
I can't take your call right now.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.325
The fisherman's name is Jiang Gui-cheng.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.328
He's based out of Jordan Wet Market

30:19.520 --> 30:20.931
I'm on my way.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.769
The crowds there will create chaos.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.726
Help me one last time.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.127
Let's go.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.089
Sir.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.725
Is he worth breaking protocol for?

30:43.600 --> 30:45.125
He's a troublemaker...

30:45.960 --> 30:47.928
he'll yield more than any informant.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.841
Follow them!

31:28.320 --> 31:29.242
Move over!

32:03.920 --> 32:05.160
Everyone, get out!

32:08.120 --> 32:08.962
Calm down.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.765
Are you okay?

33:35.640 --> 33:37.244
Call him.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.651
Tomorrow at noon...

33:50.080 --> 33:52.811
bring Chen Shut-sheng by
car and wait for my call

33:52.960 --> 33:55.042
or I'll kill your partner.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.679
Don't be stupid

34:20.320 --> 34:21.606
I want to save A-de too!

34:25.960 --> 34:27.121
I'll lead this operation.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.406
Found a location yet?

34:34.280 --> 34:35.121
This is the place.

34:35.159 --> 34:37.161
The area is open and minimal interference.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.808
As long as Shut brings the transmitter...

34:40.000 --> 34:41.364
when he sends a signal

34:41.679 --> 34:44.081
I can triangulate Boss Kui's
location in 5 minutes.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.804
Are you sure he'll radio Boss Kui?

34:47.080 --> 34:49.242
I let him go the other day
just to give him hope.

34:50.159 --> 34:51.525
He's afraid to die...

34:51.800 --> 34:53.404
he'll radio Boss Kui for help.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.523
He'll definitely radio me for help.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.249
Track his location quickly and rescue him.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.606
Run the test.

35:11.760 --> 35:12.682
Okay.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.570
A boat leaves at 9pm tomorrow.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.401
Go.

35:19.960 --> 35:20.802
A GPS bug.

35:20.840 --> 35:21.921
Find a way to attach it to Jiang.

35:23.880 --> 35:25.405
Then we can track his movements.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.086
Can you handle this?

35:31.240 --> 35:32.890
If many cops show up...

35:33.200 --> 35:34.281
only I can help you

35:36.880 --> 35:38.564
I can't take anymore...

35:38.600 --> 35:40.125
just kill me.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.450
Bring Shut to the car next to you.

36:20.640 --> 36:23.405
Plate no. JX9293.

36:27.640 --> 36:28.641
Check that license plate.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.286
Where did he call from?

36:34.800 --> 36:36.529
We're still tracing it.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.325
If you try anything

36:47.440 --> 36:49.090
I'll chop your partner's hand off.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.005
The address is in the sun visor.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.126
You have 15 minutes.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.362
Ditch your phone and earpiece.

36:59.760 --> 37:00.522
Did you trace him?

37:00.560 --> 37:02.289
He hung up, we lost him.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.209
Start the car.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.685
Follow him!

37:30.880 --> 37:32.211
Quick! Follow him!

37:32.440 --> 37:34.204
We can't lose him!

38:26.920 --> 38:29.161
You'll be fine.

38:31.280 --> 38:32.088
You'll be fine.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.851
Where's A-de?

39:44.240 --> 39:45.002
Where is he?

39:45.360 --> 39:46.088
Tell me.

39:46.680 --> 39:47.408
Tell me.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.365
Silver-colored car

39:50.440 --> 39:51.726
find it yourself.

39:52.400 --> 39:53.606
Damn you!

39:54.360 --> 39:55.088
Damn.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.844
You're wasting valuable time...

39:59.880 --> 40:02.804
The bomb is set to go off in 5 minutes.

40:14.400 --> 40:15.367
A-de!

40:16.160 --> 40:17.127
A-de!

40:17.720 --> 40:18.960
A-de!

42:32.640 --> 42:33.687
A-de!

44:45.320 --> 44:47.527
Yes, please hold.

44:48.640 --> 44:50.369
Sir, it's the Superintendent.

44:55.720 --> 44:56.767
Have you found Jiang yet?

44:58.520 --> 44:59.442
Yes.

44:59.520 --> 45:00.726
He's at sea...

45:02.400 --> 45:04.050
south of Hong Kong.

45:04.240 --> 45:05.526
When do we move in?

45:05.880 --> 45:06.722
Don't know.

45:08.960 --> 45:10.246
He's on the high seas.

45:10.840 --> 45:12.001
It's out of our jurisdiction

45:12.080 --> 45:13.650
I don't have authorization.

45:17.360 --> 45:18.566
Hold him!

45:20.560 --> 45:21.607
Give me some time.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.000
A-de is out of time!

45:25.040 --> 45:26.963
You never once suspected him?

45:33.400 --> 45:35.164
He borrowed $10M from loan sharks.

45:38.080 --> 45:39.320
Jiang was tipped off!

45:39.520 --> 45:41.841
- Regardless...
- Then A-de must still be alive!

45:46.400 --> 45:48.004
If he broke the law...

45:49.960 --> 45:51.962
I'll arrest him myself.

46:40.640 --> 46:42.404
"Settle Your Debts!"

47:47.640 --> 47:49.210
I texted the PIN to you.

47:50.320 --> 47:53.005
There's enough money to
last you a few years.

47:55.280 --> 47:57.009
Are you in trouble?

48:15.360 --> 48:16.691
I'm leaving

48:18.280 --> 48:20.009
I'm pregnant.

48:29.560 --> 48:31.642
Can I get more living expenses?

48:41.120 --> 48:42.565
That's all there is.

48:43.720 --> 48:45.449
It's up to you how you spend the money.

48:47.720 --> 48:48.881
If you keep the baby

48:50.360 --> 48:52.169
it's your responsibility.

49:01.200 --> 49:03.089
If you think it's the right decision

49:05.520 --> 49:06.407
stick by it.

49:39.080 --> 49:40.889
Quit, go to Thailand.

49:45.920 --> 49:47.729
Shut is dead.

49:47.920 --> 49:49.684
BOSS Kui will kill you

49:50.040 --> 49:51.963
I'm staying to help.

49:53.040 --> 49:54.041
Take her.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.085
Don't move

50:41.200 --> 50:43.601
I only trust what I can hold in my hands

50:45.000 --> 50:47.765
I have to get that gold.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.921
Go to Thailand and never come back

50:58.640 --> 51:00.722
I can't give you what you want.

51:01.840 --> 51:03.888
Gui-cheng!

51:46.040 --> 51:47.690
Going to Water World?

51:49.640 --> 51:51.130
You even brought flares.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.804
Odds are against us...

52:04.040 --> 52:05.530
but I have to risk it.

52:07.120 --> 52:09.122
Don't worry

52:09.160 --> 52:10.650
I'll take the rap.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.968
If you're screwed, I'm screwed.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.521
The more the merrier?

52:58.520 --> 52:59.681
Two divers just went in.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.842
Boss Kui's gold cache
might be at the bottom.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.924
Copy, I'll go look.

53:05.400 --> 53:06.401
Keep searching.

54:20.880 --> 54:22.405
Jiang Gui-cheng.

54:23.840 --> 54:26.161
What do you want from me?

54:29.760 --> 54:31.444
I want to work for you.

54:37.640 --> 54:40.086
He and I were brothers.

54:40.440 --> 54:42.329
You killed Shut, what's there to discuss?

54:43.040 --> 54:44.849
He tried to kill me first.

54:46.720 --> 54:48.768
Fishermen are all...

54:49.320 --> 54:51.084
brothers at sea.

54:52.360 --> 54:54.727
Now all my brothers are starving...

54:55.760 --> 54:57.808
We are begging you for help.

55:03.760 --> 55:06.570
Think I'll let you leave here alive?

55:20.920 --> 55:22.160
If I die...

55:23.520 --> 55:25.443
I'll take you down with me

55:26.120 --> 55:27.645
I just want money...

55:28.400 --> 55:29.890
I don't want any trouble.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.041
Step back!

55:42.000 --> 55:43.968
We both worship the Sea Goddess

55:45.400 --> 55:47.209
I'll deal with your brothers...

55:48.840 --> 55:51.525
in the fairest way possible.

55:54.240 --> 55:55.048
Gui-cheng

55:56.160 --> 55:59.050
I'll find out whether Shut betrayed you.

56:00.440 --> 56:01.965
As for business...

56:02.960 --> 56:04.371
we'll discuss it later

56:06.200 --> 56:07.247
.“okay?

56:08.040 --> 56:09.246
You're a smart guy.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.843
If I let you go, I'll live to...

56:12.120 --> 56:13.246
regret it!

56:25.720 --> 56:26.687
Get him!

57:16.280 --> 57:17.088
Did it go well?

57:20.440 --> 57:22.329
The gold cache is underwater.

57:22.360 --> 57:24.442
We have the diving gear from the ship.

57:28.560 --> 57:30.403
Since Kui want us dead...

57:31.200 --> 57:31.962
we steal it!

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.768
Where's A-de?

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.721
I won't tell...

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.241
unless you beg.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.601
Beg you!

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.011
Do you...

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.290
value your pride...

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.930
over your partner's life?

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.440
Fine

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.406
I beg you.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.210
Tell me where A-de is.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.368
Is that how you beg for help?

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.121
I beg you...

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.084
please tell me where A-de is.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.890
You're pathetic.

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:51.965
Wake up.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.201
You consider him a brother?

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.410
In this world...

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.003
money buys brothers

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.125
I've got gold.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.530
He's got nowhere left go.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.724
We became brothers.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.608
You dragged him into this.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.244
So you caught me

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.289
I'll serve time...

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.204
but I'll be out

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.971
I'll still be alive.

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.005
You won't live to serve time.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.042
You and I are the same.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.648
Call the police...

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.322
white floating casino...

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.082
many casualties...

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.927
We need to change his
diaper, please wait outside

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.408
Hong Kong police successfully crack...

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.521
crack largest gold smuggling
case yesterday...

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.326
busting a major smuggling ring.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.925
The alleged ringleader, Chen Ding-Kui...

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.322
aka Boss Kui, was arrested.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:40.446
Kui appeared before the court today...

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.931
and was remanded in custody.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.605
The gold involved in the
smuggling crackdown 3 months ago...

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.722
remains in international waters.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.849
The country of origin...

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.770
and bordering states...

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.531
all staked claim to the smuggled gold.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.042
A marine salvage ban is in effect
as they await a ruling...

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.443
from the Hague Tribunal.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.246
A Storm Warning has been issued.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.646
Tropical Cyclone Queenie...

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:27.645
now centered at 710km south-southeast
of Hong Kong...

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.728
is expected to travel northwest...

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.650
and be closest to
Hong Kong early Wednesday morning.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.967
A public extreme weather
advisory is in effect.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.641
Leave after you finish.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.446
A typhoon is coming

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.166
the seas will be rough.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.327
What about you?

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.521
Once the storm arrives

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.445
it won't be safe here.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.648
Once the storm comes, the
police fleet will leave.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.850
It's the chance Jiang's been waiting for.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.691
Look at this report.

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.248
The police found his body.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.604
The body has yet to be identified.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.644
Even if you're right

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.570
the typhoon is still coming!

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.610
Are you willing to risk your life...

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.881
just to catch him?

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.046
Is it worth it?

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.884
It's not just about catching him.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.045
So many terrible things...

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.171
have happened.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.365
What was the cause?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.286
That cache of gold.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.928
As long as that gold exists

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.367
people will covet and fight for it...

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.130
even die for it

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:21.841
I want it to end

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.730
I'm not as noble as you.

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.966
All I know is...

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.809
I don't want to lose a father

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.402
I need support...

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.963
I don't know if I survive

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.449
I decided to have an abortion.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.924
Ask yourself

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.724
what's more important to you?

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.085
What other people think...

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.205
or the life in your womb?

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.529
Is it that hard to raise a child?

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.929
Just food on the table.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.844
"Unconfirmed Corpse of.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.689
Jiang Kui-cheng Pulled from Sea".

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.445
You came ashore.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.205
Don't follow me anymore.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.089
You don't belong to the sea.

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.721
Hoist it onto the deck!

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.321
It's the last lot!

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.841
Okay, pull.

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.002
Watch out!

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.931
Dying is easy.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.851
Have you decided?

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.687
How much is there?

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.845
At least $500M.

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.364
How much...

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.764
is my cut?

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.442
Turn back!

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.041
You were coerced...

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.042
you'll get a reduced sentence!

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.326
Sai Gau!

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.648
Why can't you just let me go?

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.369
You want me to go back to being a cop?

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.088
How much does a cop make?

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.971
Listen.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.964
There's no turning back!

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.566
You still don't get it?

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.290
This gold will ruin you!

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:32.726
It's you who ruined me!

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.969
If it wasn't for you

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:47.681
I wouldn't have met Jiang!

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.520
Once this gold is gone

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.365
you'll come to your senses!

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.529
This gold is nothing but trouble

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.809
I won't let anyone have it!

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:25.683
Kill him!

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.765
I'm not here to fight you.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.250
Nothing's more important than gold.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.881
You force me to do it!

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:49.803
Watch out!

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.401
Let go!

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:49.251
Let go!

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:51.767
Let go!

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:03.528
Bastard, you let go!

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:42.123
You should stop now!
