WEBVTT

01:28.671 --> 01:30.006
What do we tell Mom?

01:33.676 --> 01:35.011
I'll take care of it.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.434
She was such a nice person.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.603
Such a good person.

01:45.688 --> 01:47.690
She didn't deserve what happened to her.

01:53.321 --> 01:54.948
All of this ends today.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.264
Hey.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.474
I'm so sorry about Erin.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.318
She was just trying to help us.

02:35.613 --> 02:36.906
Hey, Scot.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.868
Good to see your face around here again.

02:39.951 --> 02:43.204
Hi, Mrs. Locke. It's good to have my face
seen around here again.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.791
So, what's everybody up to?

02:48.334 --> 02:50.378
-Helping Scot unload some equipment.
-Yeah.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.547
We're filming stuff for our sequel today.

02:52.630 --> 02:57.302
Ah! I wish I could stay around and watch
you guys work your magic. Have fun.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.013
Hey, Duncan.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.309
Have you seen Erin this morning?

03:06.603 --> 03:08.188
Actually, I was gonna tell you.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.690
She left last night
when everybody was out.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.150
Left?

03:12.650 --> 03:13.985
What? For good?

03:14.068 --> 03:16.696
Yeah. Yeah, she said
that she's terrible at goodbyes,

03:16.779 --> 03:19.032
but she wanted me
to thank you for everything.

03:19.115 --> 03:20.575
Okay.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.160
That's weird.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.996
I hope she'll be happy wherever she lands.

03:26.748 --> 03:27.707
Me too.

03:29.876 --> 03:34.255
It's a shame you don't get a day off
after Winter Fest like everybody else.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.759
Ha. Unfortunately, the deadline
on the theater's coming up way too fast.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.510
Have a good day.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.678
-Bye.
-Bye.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.096
Bye, guys! Break a leg!

03:42.180 --> 03:43.181
Bye, Mom!

03:58.488 --> 04:00.365
All right, let's get this done

04:00.448 --> 04:02.700
for Erin, for your dad, and for us.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.455
Everybody clear on the plan?

04:09.749 --> 04:12.794
-We sure he's bringing Eden?
-Oh, he's definitely bringing Eden.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.420
She's like his little minion.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.422
Bode?

04:16.506 --> 04:17.882
I'm totally ready.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.970
So what exactly happens
when we trap Gabe in the well house?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.514
He's not trapped.

04:25.139 --> 04:26.391
He's destroyed.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.144
Crossing the threshold doesn't trap
an echo. It vanishes them entirely.

04:31.729 --> 04:34.315
That's why Dodge tricked me
into giving her the Anywhere Key.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.027
So she could escape
out the storage closet.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.698
Look, I get the plan,

04:42.657 --> 04:43.783
but I can do more.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.494
Dunc, it's you he's after.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.579
We need you to be the bait.

04:49.914 --> 04:52.125
I'm ready if I'm needed for anything else.

04:53.334 --> 04:54.294
Thanks.

04:58.589 --> 04:59.966
I hope this works.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.218
It'll work.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.097
Now we have the element of surprise.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.975
Do you actually believe

05:09.058 --> 05:12.937
they want you to come over
just to film this stupid movie?

05:13.021 --> 05:16.816
It doesn't matter.
Getting into that house gets us to Duncan.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.570
Just saying,
maybe we should have a backup plan.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.697
And as usual…

05:24.824 --> 05:28.244
I'm already 12 steps ahead of you.

05:28.828 --> 05:29.662
Great.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.498
So we go over, break down the door,

05:32.582 --> 05:35.043
use the Chain Key, snatch Duncan.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.754
No, this is back up.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.922
First, we find out what they know,

05:40.006 --> 05:42.884
then we get Duncan alone,
throw him into the truck,

05:42.967 --> 05:45.094
and bring him to the Forge
so we can make our key.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.016
-You're not bringing all the keys?
-I am, but not the Echo Key.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.559
That one stays here.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.562
Why does your plan
have so many steps? Hmm?

05:54.645 --> 05:57.982
Because if I were in charge,
we'd already have him making the key.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.609
Are you an idiot?

05:59.692 --> 06:01.694
Do you not understand this still?

06:02.278 --> 06:06.532
They have keys
that they can use as weapons.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.201
If we wanna avoid that,

06:08.284 --> 06:11.079
then we have to snatch Duncan up
when they least expect it.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.707
-Is this starting to make sense to you?
-Who is the idiot here? Hmm?

06:16.125 --> 06:18.378
Because what if
they are expecting it, huh?

06:19.295 --> 06:21.964
It's entirely possible
that they are onto you.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.801
It doesn't matter. They can't match me.

06:26.010 --> 06:29.138
And let's be real,
I know what this is really about.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.975
You just don't wanna see
your girl get hurt, hmm?

06:33.059 --> 06:34.268
Enough!

06:34.811 --> 06:36.604
No more of this back talk.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.482
-You only exist to serve me.

06:39.565 --> 06:43.528
No more, "Hey, have you considered this?"
No more, "Hey, why don't we try that?"

06:43.611 --> 06:44.904
-Understood?

06:44.987 --> 06:45.988
Okay!

06:47.990 --> 06:49.117
Go get our test subject.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.035
-Then we're out of here.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.153
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

07:25.236 --> 07:29.615
I just have to go and check on a student.
You got that math homework to finish?

07:29.699 --> 07:31.367
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.

07:42.336 --> 07:45.590
Oh! Dude! You got lucky!
You're actually trash!

07:45.673 --> 07:48.926
Lucky! Man, I invented this game.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.846
What the hell, man?
Oh, Mr. Bennett, what's up?

07:51.929 --> 07:55.850
I got a tip that you know something
about the theft of my historical artifact.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.436
I… I don't.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.606
Oh boy. What'd you steal now, bro?

08:01.689 --> 08:04.108
Nothing, man. Seriously.
I didn't take anything. I swear.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.903
Somebody sent me an email
and said you did.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.947
-Well, it… it wasn't me.
-Okay, come on.

08:10.031 --> 08:13.618
Brinker, just tell him what you did
with this artifact, man.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.001
Oh, okay. I get it.

08:22.502 --> 08:26.088
Bro, seriously? I didn't steal it,
Mr. Bennett. I don't know who did.

08:27.673 --> 08:31.385
How about I talk to Coach Carlson
and get you kicked off the hockey team?

08:31.469 --> 08:33.554
Whoa, relax, all right?
It won't happen again.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.723
-It better not!

08:36.265 --> 08:37.892
Okay, sorry.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.980
-Hey.
-That was, uh, intense.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.067
-You all right?
-Yeah, I just…

08:48.694 --> 08:50.947
-I brought you a coffee.
-Thank you.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.661
You, um… You wanna go talk?

08:58.704 --> 09:00.122
Yeah, sure.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.378
Something was stolen from me.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.755
And you… you thought those kids did it?

09:07.838 --> 09:11.175
Yeah, one of them pulled a prank
and said the other one stole it.

09:12.843 --> 09:13.928
What was stolen?

09:14.762 --> 09:18.683
A historical artifact
that's been in my family for generations.

09:20.351 --> 09:23.312
I'd be upset
if something like that went missing too.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.315
This artifact is clearly important to you.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.318
What is it exactly?

09:32.405 --> 09:37.618
Well, if I… if I talk about it,
you'll think I've lost my mind.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.329
You had a dollhouse replica of my home.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.665
Yet I'm still here.

09:47.336 --> 09:52.216
It's a, um…
It's a twisted-looking piece of rare iron.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.385
It sorta looks like a melted musket ball,

09:54.468 --> 09:57.388
and it dates back
to the Revolutionary War.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.726
It was passed down in my family
for generations along with something else.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.478
What's the something else?

10:05.229 --> 10:07.106
My ancestor's journal entry.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.734
It details where the object came from.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.194
So where'd it come from?

10:13.279 --> 10:14.739
You sure you wanna hear this?

10:21.037 --> 10:25.124
He describes it as an opening in a cavern.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.376
A doorway.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.545
A doorway to what?

10:30.171 --> 10:31.464
To the Beyond.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.886
A spirit world of staggering
supernatural power.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.472
I think that the artifact that was stolen

10:39.555 --> 10:42.642
is the key to opening this doorway

10:42.725 --> 10:44.185
if I could just find it.

10:47.396 --> 10:50.775
Is that why you came here to Matheson?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.194
To find this doorway?

10:53.277 --> 10:57.907
We needed the change of scenery,
but it was one of the big reasons.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.663
How is it possible
that you're not calculating

11:03.746 --> 11:06.332
the shortest distance
to the nearest looney bin?

11:06.832 --> 11:09.126
Because I've been exactly where you are.

11:09.210 --> 11:14.131
You harangued some hockey bros
over a 300-year-old piece of melted iron?

11:15.007 --> 11:18.260
I tried to make sense
of a completely senseless tragedy.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.223
After Rendell was murdered,

11:23.391 --> 11:26.018
I was looking for answers,
which is why I moved here.

11:27.061 --> 11:30.564
I thought this can't be random.
There has to be something more to it.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.565
I was…

11:32.525 --> 11:36.320
I was looking for clues or connections,
you know,

11:37.029 --> 11:39.407
grasping for anything to make sense of it.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.910
Listen, not because there was,
but because I needed there to be.

11:43.411 --> 11:47.707
You can't tell me that it wouldn't help
to know definitively

11:47.790 --> 11:50.292
that there's something
beyond this mortal plane.

11:50.376 --> 11:54.338
Wouldn't it give you
some sense of peace over Rendell

11:54.422 --> 11:57.550
to know
that he's out there somewhere, and…

11:59.635 --> 12:01.220
…you could see him again?

12:03.848 --> 12:05.975
It's okay to lose yourself a little bit.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.729
You just have to
make sure you find yourself again.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.316
Sage words.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.653
Probably because they're
what Joe Ridgeway said to me

12:17.737 --> 12:20.948
when I was sitting
right where you are now.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.160
To find myself again,

12:25.161 --> 12:27.121
I needed to accept what happened.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.753
I don't think I'm there yet.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.853
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.230
So I'm pretty much set up.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.735
You don't have to do this, you know.
Be here.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.195
What?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.280
Kinsey, what else am I gonna do?

13:01.363 --> 13:02.490
-How would I--

13:02.573 --> 13:03.783
Thank you.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.536
Yeah, of course.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.747
-Rocky Road.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.168
What are friends for?

13:25.054 --> 13:28.974
What if I don't wanna be
just friends anymore?

13:38.692 --> 13:39.735
It's time.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.166
We should just get to it.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.774
What were we even doing again?

14:46.844 --> 14:47.845
You ready?

14:49.430 --> 14:50.431
Yeah.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.276
Hey, guys!

15:02.359 --> 15:04.361
-Hey!
-New wheels?

15:04.862 --> 15:05.821
Oh, yeah.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.032
Some guy in my dorm let me borrow it.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.117
-I like it.
-Thanks.

15:12.494 --> 15:13.537
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.708
Oh my God. I…
I can't believe Duncan's better.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.001
It's such good news.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.922
I know! I can't believe it myself.
Seemed like a total lost cause.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.174
Well, where is he?

15:25.257 --> 15:28.636
Upstairs, I think.
Talking to his fiancé Brian in Japan.

15:36.810 --> 15:37.770
He's here.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.482
Incoming. Repeat, incoming.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.943
Repeat, incoming.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.444
Copy.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.492
-I ran into Eden in the commons.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.995
She told me how much
she really wanted to work on the movie.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.914
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.625
She said that she regretted quitting

15:59.708 --> 16:01.835
and not being a part
of the first film, so…

16:03.545 --> 16:04.588
Right, Eden?

16:05.214 --> 16:06.882
-Sure.
-Great!

16:06.966 --> 16:08.175
The more, the merrier.

16:08.258 --> 16:11.887
Scot's upstairs setting up the first shot.
He sent you the script, right?

16:11.971 --> 16:15.724
Yeah. I can't believe he finished it.
I thought he had writer's block.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.435
Yeah, I guess
inspiration struck.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.483
So your mom doesn't mind
we're taking up the house for the day?

16:24.566 --> 16:25.901
No, she's at work.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.031
What about Erin? Where is she?

16:33.659 --> 16:34.618
She's gone.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.287
Gone where?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.289
No one knows.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.543
We think she just wanted
to make a clean break.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.086
Start over somewhere.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.423
Makes sense.

16:48.882 --> 16:51.135
Whac-a-Bode 2.0.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.762
Whac-a-Tyler! Lightning round!

16:53.846 --> 16:56.432
I don't remember agreeing to these rules
or even playing.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.809
-Agh!
-Get off! Get off! My turn.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.728
-What's up, guys?

17:00.811 --> 17:03.689
Hey, thanks again, man,
for helping find the Memory Key.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.984
-Duncan wouldn't be whole without it.
-I'm happy that I could help.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.777
I can't wait to see him.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.656
Eden volunteered to help out.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.200
I was thinking maybe craft services?

17:15.284 --> 17:16.243
Craft what?

17:16.326 --> 17:18.495
Like putting together
the snacks for the crew.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.955
Mm-hmm.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.416
I love snacks.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.169
Me too. They're yummy.

17:31.091 --> 17:31.967
Perfect.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.678
You can work with Tyler in the kitchen.
We'll be upstairs.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.433
Agh!

17:40.350 --> 17:41.268
Come on.

17:41.351 --> 17:43.729
-Agh!
-So Duncan's gonna help out too?

17:44.229 --> 17:47.524
-Yeah, as soon as he's done with his call.
-All right, cool.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.863
Ah! Nephropida himself!

17:52.946 --> 17:54.823
-Hey, what's up, man?
-Hey.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.034
Listen, I, uh…

17:57.117 --> 17:59.661
I really appreciate you
still being game to do this

17:59.745 --> 18:02.039
despite our little…
dustup.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.792
It's water under the bridge.

18:05.793 --> 18:10.047
Okay, cool. Right, so let's get to it.
Did you get a chance to read the script?

18:11.006 --> 18:12.549
-Yeah, I did. It's great.

18:12.633 --> 18:16.637
It feels like, you know,
if Carpenter made Beauty and the Beast.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.223
Oh, I'm blushing.

18:19.306 --> 18:23.602
Okay, so our first scene
is Amanda's dream sequence,

18:23.685 --> 18:26.939
wherein our heroine envisions Nephropida
as a human man.

18:27.648 --> 18:28.774
-All right.
-Okay?

18:29.274 --> 18:30.359
Where's Doug?

18:31.819 --> 18:33.445
Uh, Douglas, yes.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.198
Ah, he, uh, had to pop out
to get a couple of gels

18:36.281 --> 18:38.534
for our day for night stuff
we're shooting later.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.036
What about Zadie?

18:41.787 --> 18:45.666
Called in sick. Some bad fish
in Bill's chowder last night.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.714
-Should have gone with Phil's.
-Phil's!

18:54.133 --> 18:57.261
Okay, so find your marks just there,
and let's just walk through it.

19:03.475 --> 19:08.814
Okay, we've got water, soda, juice. Uh…

19:10.440 --> 19:11.817
Those are my uncle's.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.570
I'll make sure to tell him "thank you"
when I see him.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.827
-Mmm.
-Okay.

19:22.828 --> 19:27.040
We've got lunch meats
so we can make sandwiches.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.002
How about you make the sandwiches,

19:30.085 --> 19:33.463
and I go upstairs to see
what they're up to? Hmm?

19:35.215 --> 19:36.925
Uh, wait, Eden.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.095
Wanna see a magic trick?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.306
No, not really.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.142
Come on. It'll only be a second.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.352
Just watch.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.563
Fine.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.404
Try and keep your eye
on the grape.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.378
Okay, where's the grape?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.174
Pick one.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.719
Pick one!

20:20.802 --> 20:23.096
Okay. Jesus, relax.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.057
This one.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.185
You lose.

20:34.816 --> 20:35.943
What the hell?

20:46.662 --> 20:47.663
Let me out, you…

20:53.752 --> 20:56.797
-Holy shit. It worked.
-Of course it worked.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.675
-Okay.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.052
I'm gonna go check on them upstairs.
You good here?

21:02.135 --> 21:03.136
Piece of cake.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.102
Aloha.

21:11.895 --> 21:15.649
Okay, remember, this is the first time
you guys are really seeing each other,

21:15.732 --> 21:16.817
at least in the dream.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.529
All right, and action on rehearsal.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.657
-Gabe?
-Hmm? Yeah.

21:23.740 --> 21:24.825
Yeah. Sorry.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.579
-It's you.

21:31.498 --> 21:34.334
You… You recognize me?

21:36.003 --> 21:38.755
Somehow, I just knew
that there was more to you

21:38.839 --> 21:39.798
than that shell.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.259
All this time,

21:43.468 --> 21:46.054
I never really knew if you saw me.

21:47.556 --> 21:48.598
I see you now.

21:49.766 --> 21:50.726
And cut.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.936
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

21:53.729 --> 21:54.855
Okay, nice. Gabe.

21:55.439 --> 21:59.151
So let's try a little bit more relief
when we see Amanda's acceptance here.

21:59.234 --> 22:00.319
Next go-around, yeah?

22:01.445 --> 22:02.696
-All right.
-Great.

22:09.828 --> 22:13.165
Just a minute. Apologies.
Crew of one today and whatnot.

22:13.874 --> 22:19.338
Your face when that came down.
You were all, "What? What?"

22:43.028 --> 22:44.112
Uh-oh.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.033
Hold on to the cup, Jamie!

22:51.578 --> 22:52.412
Where's Eden?

22:53.663 --> 22:54.664
Uh…

22:54.748 --> 22:57.584
Bode trapped her
with some new magic trick of his.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.795
-Been there.
-Okay, cool.

22:59.878 --> 23:03.215
Just a quick lighting fix,
and we should be good to go.

23:03.298 --> 23:06.343
Oh bollocks.
I've left my light meter in Kinsey's room.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.386
I can go get it.

23:07.469 --> 23:10.472
Great. Uh, it's in my camera bag.
Outside pocket.

23:17.604 --> 23:20.148
Don't you think Amanda
should take Nephropida's hand here?

23:20.232 --> 23:22.734
Uh… Yeah, I like that.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.862
-How do you feel, Nephropida?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.573
Yeah, sure.

24:00.605 --> 24:01.898
You bitch!

24:01.982 --> 24:04.109
Help! Scot, Tyler!

24:09.614 --> 24:11.199
No!

24:13.952 --> 24:14.911
Jamie?

24:17.414 --> 24:20.375
Hey, what did I tell you
about coming in here when I'm not home?

24:20.459 --> 24:22.127
I was just playing.

24:22.210 --> 24:25.088
This is not a toy. This is an antique.
Take your arm out.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.011
-Dad!

24:37.934 --> 24:38.768
That's weird.

24:43.273 --> 24:45.609
-When'd you get this key?

24:52.824 --> 24:55.035
Okay, go to your room. I have work to do.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.458
-No!

25:11.176 --> 25:13.136
Guess we're doing this the hard way.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.807
Tyler!

25:22.604 --> 25:23.730
Where's your uncle?

25:23.813 --> 25:25.273
I'm right here, asshole.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.610
Ah. The man of the hour.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.362
No, no, Duncan, no!

25:30.445 --> 25:31.821
Let 'em go, Dodge.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.533
Fine by me. All I need is you.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.081
Thanks, Scot.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.877
I was wondering how I might get that back.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.090
-Scot!

26:05.772 --> 26:08.066
Stay back! Stay back!

26:13.905 --> 26:14.948
That'll be you next.

26:20.495 --> 26:22.289
Guys! Guys!

26:25.166 --> 26:26.042
Uh-oh.

26:30.755 --> 26:31.840
Hi, Uncle Duncan.

26:34.217 --> 26:35.135
Uncle Dunc!

26:35.218 --> 26:37.095
Told you they were onto us.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.189
Let me go!

26:49.774 --> 26:51.860
Kinsey! Tyler!

26:54.154 --> 26:55.155
Uncle Dunc!

27:00.619 --> 27:02.621
-See you later, assclowns.
-No.

27:03.246 --> 27:04.122
What?

27:04.205 --> 27:05.957
-We're done, Eden.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.089
Gabe!

27:18.345 --> 27:19.554
Where is he taking them?

27:23.808 --> 27:24.934
Are you kidding me?

27:26.895 --> 27:29.272
What? Are you gonna fight me?

27:30.398 --> 27:31.358
If I need to.

27:32.067 --> 27:35.654
Okay. I've been wanting to do this
for a very long time.

27:36.237 --> 27:37.197
Really?

27:38.156 --> 27:39.240
Go for it.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.516
-Kinsey!

28:11.564 --> 28:13.983
-Get back! Get back!
-Whoa, let him go!

28:14.609 --> 28:15.652
Get back!

28:17.404 --> 28:18.863
-Back off!

28:24.744 --> 28:27.539
Gotta hand it to you. That was impressive.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.209
Seriously, masterful performances by all.

28:33.461 --> 28:35.130
If it weren't for that bird,

28:37.424 --> 28:38.883
it would have been a lot closer.

28:40.051 --> 28:41.302
So what do you want?

28:55.650 --> 28:58.945
Just 'cause I made a key once
doesn't mean I can do it again.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.033
Well, I hope that's not true.

29:04.868 --> 29:05.702
For Bode's sake.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.121
Don't do it, Uncle Dunc!

29:12.500 --> 29:14.043
You getting enough air there?

29:14.669 --> 29:18.089
Stop, stop, stop!
I'll make the key if you let him go.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.264
-I'll do you one better.

29:27.640 --> 29:28.850
If you make my key,

29:29.642 --> 29:31.060
I'll let both of you go.

29:31.603 --> 29:35.064
-I will. I promise.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.359
I won't give a damn about any of you
once I have my key.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.245
To make the key,
I need to know your intention.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.967
What do you want it to do?

30:05.720 --> 30:07.722
Okay, just think this through, all right?

30:09.682 --> 30:12.310
Gabe just colossally screwed you over.

30:13.019 --> 30:15.146
He used you. He left you here.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.440
-He doesn't deserve your help anymore.
-Okay?

30:18.441 --> 30:22.070
Just let Scot go,
and, uh, tell us where Gabe is.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.029
Okay?

30:27.909 --> 30:29.577
-Scot!

30:55.854 --> 30:57.522
Just keep putting pressure on it.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.984
-You okay?

31:02.652 --> 31:03.653
Eden's gone.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.533
But we know he's making a key somewhere.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.161
Through the door,
it looked like some kind of cabin.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.789
-The question is, where?

31:18.710 --> 31:20.003
Eden left her jacket.

31:28.177 --> 31:29.304
What is it?

31:30.722 --> 31:35.393
Delivery receipts
for burgers and pizza and gyros.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.858
To an address. 60 Bear Creek Road.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.860
-Where is that?
-Checking.

31:45.486 --> 31:49.532
Boom. That's deep in the woods.
That's way on the other side of town.

31:49.616 --> 31:53.119
As in the kind of place you'd have a cabin
with a key-making forge.

31:54.120 --> 31:54.954
Let's hope.

31:55.038 --> 31:55.997
Come on.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.429
You've already destroyed so much.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.432
Where's this end for you?

32:17.018 --> 32:19.479
What about
everything your brother destroyed? Hmm?

32:20.313 --> 32:22.148
-You ever think about that?
-Rendell?

32:22.815 --> 32:26.235
His greed's the only reason I'm here.
He wanted to open the Black Door

32:26.319 --> 32:29.030
and make a key
so he wouldn't have to age out of magic.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.200
It's his fault I got into Lucas.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.536
It's insane to think
that Lucas is still in there somewhere.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.038
Lucas was weak.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.874
He let Rendell call all the shots.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.294
And Ellie, he was so devoted to her,
and for what? It was pathetic.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.671
He wasn't weak.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.716
He was funny, and he was caring,
and he was kind.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.969
He deserves better
than whatever you did to him.

32:51.052 --> 32:54.097
I don't think I'm funny?
Feel like I'm caring? Kind?

32:55.682 --> 32:58.643
-I guess it's subjective, so--
-You're going to be stopped!

33:02.772 --> 33:03.648
Really?

33:05.483 --> 33:08.528
Like that time you thought you killed me
with your cute light sword?

33:10.196 --> 33:11.823
How about that time
your brother and sister

33:11.906 --> 33:14.534
threw Ellie through the Black Door
thinking it was me?

33:16.411 --> 33:17.829
Stopped like that?

33:19.580 --> 33:22.083
-Is that what you mean?

33:29.674 --> 33:31.467
You better hope
your uncle does this right.

33:33.219 --> 33:35.138
-How much longer?

33:37.515 --> 33:39.350
The process is the process.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.646
Now I have to imbue the key
with its intention.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.744
-Is it working?
-It would be if you'd shut up.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.707
-Who is that?
-Don't worry about it.

34:02.790 --> 34:05.626
-Who's in there?
-Just make the damn key.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.467
Blood sacrifice, right?

34:14.177 --> 34:16.095
Was Chamberlin lying about that too?

34:19.307 --> 34:20.808
It has to be Locke blood.

34:22.769 --> 34:23.936
Of course it does.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.266
All right, next left.

35:03.601 --> 35:04.727
Time?

35:04.811 --> 35:06.562
Still ten minutes out.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.163
-Is it done?
-Should be.

35:44.642 --> 35:45.601
Okay?

35:47.228 --> 35:48.354
Now let Bode go.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.233
Not until I have proof that it works.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.870
Last good thing Eden did for me.

36:04.912 --> 36:06.455
Get me a guinea pig.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.084
-Are you kidding me?
-I gotta try it out on someone.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.962
Unless you want me
to try it out on your little nephew.

36:16.465 --> 36:18.426
-You'll regret this.
-Doubt it.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.847
See, in the world I come from,
the chaos consumes us,

36:22.930 --> 36:24.599
and we consume the chaos.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.605
But over here,

36:32.815 --> 36:37.153
this world has so much potential
to be reborn and consumed.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.780
-To be ruled.

36:41.949 --> 36:44.869
Hey, man. This isn't funny, bro.

36:44.952 --> 36:45.828
Might not be funny,

36:47.246 --> 36:48.664
but it is gonna be fun.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.211
I'm so sorry.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.299
That's incredible.

36:58.382 --> 37:01.636
All right, hold still, Javi, buddy.
Come on. This isn't gonna hurt.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.930
I don't know, it might.
I actually don't know.

37:22.490 --> 37:23.491
Javi.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.327
Go smash your head against the wall.

37:41.008 --> 37:42.176
All right, stop.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.649
You did good, Uncle Dunc.

38:01.696 --> 38:02.780
Clean yourself up.

38:05.491 --> 38:07.660
Thank you for your help.
You're free to go.

38:19.922 --> 38:20.923
Hey.

38:22.883 --> 38:25.052
Come on, come on.
Let's get out of here. Go!

38:26.262 --> 38:27.555
-Where are we?
-No idea.

38:27.638 --> 38:30.599
We need to get as far away as possible,
as fast as possible.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.689
You ready for your second test?

38:37.523 --> 38:38.441
Of course.

38:41.819 --> 38:42.987
Kill 'em both.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.793
He lied. We gotta run now! Go!

39:07.178 --> 39:08.012
Look!

39:08.763 --> 39:11.599
There's a road!
Hey! Come here. We gotta split up.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.142
-Why?
-Just run towards the road!

39:13.225 --> 39:14.935
-What are you doing?
-Just go! Go!

39:22.318 --> 39:23.152
Hey!

39:24.362 --> 39:25.446
This way.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.972
-Is this it?

39:52.515 --> 39:53.808
This is the address.

39:55.559 --> 39:59.438
-How deep in the woods is this place?
-Guys! Guys, help!

40:00.106 --> 40:01.107
Oh my God.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.485
Stay with the car.
Get ready to pull out of here.

40:04.568 --> 40:05.778
Are you okay?

40:06.362 --> 40:07.238
Yeah.

40:07.321 --> 40:09.865
-Where's Uncle Duncan?
-Uncle Dunc made a key for Gabe.

40:09.949 --> 40:13.869
Gabe used it on Javi,
and then he started chasing after us.

40:38.185 --> 40:40.104
-Go to the car with Scot.
-Okay.

40:40.187 --> 40:41.522
Wait for us there.

40:52.408 --> 40:54.618
Hey, Ty.

40:55.494 --> 40:57.705
-What did he do to you?
-I don't know, man.

40:58.372 --> 40:59.248
But it feels good.

40:59.832 --> 41:02.251
-Agh!

41:05.796 --> 41:07.840
Sorry, bro. Gotta finish you.

41:13.512 --> 41:15.931
-Dunc, are you okay? Come on.

41:20.436 --> 41:23.814
Come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on.

41:23.898 --> 41:24.857
There!

41:35.409 --> 41:36.911
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

41:39.663 --> 41:40.498
Hit it!

41:59.600 --> 42:00.643
What happened?

42:03.270 --> 42:04.313
They got away.

42:06.398 --> 42:07.983
It's not the end of the world.

42:14.657 --> 42:16.242
Let's go make you some new friends.
