00:02.502 --> 00:04.993
- Do you have therapy today?
- It's not therapy.

00:05.071 --> 00:07.403
- Well, you're seeing a psychiatrist.
- Not for therapy.

00:07.474 --> 00:09.567
- It's an official evaluation, okay?
- <i>[Siren Wails]</i>

00:09.642 --> 00:11.974
Person who found the body
is in the living room.

00:12.045 --> 00:14.070
Great. Crime scene first,
then we talk to the witnesses.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.081
- <i>Corpse is gonna be in the den.</i>
- Thanks.

00:16.149 --> 00:18.083
- What is that?
- What's what?

00:18.151 --> 00:20.210
- Your tie. It's staid.
- Staid?

00:20.286 --> 00:23.278
Yeah, and boring. It looks like
J. Edgar Hoover picked it out.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.450
- Look, it's something I'm workin' on, okay?
- In therapy?

00:26.526 --> 00:30.462
Gordon Gordon says that
the wild socks and the fancy ties...

00:30.530 --> 00:32.464
are all just, you know,
quiet rebellions...

00:32.531 --> 00:34.466
helping me suppress other impulses.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.468
- Isn't that good?
- You'd think so, right?

00:36.536 --> 00:39.733
But apparently, all the other issues
have to just rise to the top.

00:39.806 --> 00:42.297
Why do you call
your psychiatrist Gordon Gordon?

00:42.375 --> 00:45.139
'Cause that's how he introduces himself.
"Hi. I'm Gordon. Gordon Wyatt."

00:45.211 --> 00:47.975
Like "James. James Bond."

00:48.048 --> 00:50.346
"Bond. James Bond."

00:50.417 --> 00:53.750
Not "James. James"...James... Whatever.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.981
- <i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>
- <i>[Saroyan] We're over here.</i>

00:56.056 --> 00:58.081
You might want to tuck
your pants into your socks.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.752
- <i>The flies get in everywhere.</i>
- [Groans]

01:00.827 --> 01:03.990
<i>What, no cartoon characters on the socks?</i>

01:04.063 --> 01:06.055
Never had cartoon characters
on the socks.

01:06.132 --> 01:08.692
They were just...
Uh... Never mind, okay?

01:08.768 --> 01:11.703
- What have we got here?
- Three weeks "decomp," give or take.

01:11.771 --> 01:13.762
- Oh. Place was tossed, huh?
- No forced entry.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.434
The victim is probably the man
of the house, Terrance Bancroft.

01:16.509 --> 01:19.535
<i>His wife Clarissa identified</i>
<i>the watch and wedding ring.</i>

01:19.612 --> 01:22.308
- This isn't good for me.
- Yeah, it's pretty gross.

01:22.382 --> 01:25.613
No, not that. There's too much
soft tissue for me to tell anything.

01:25.685 --> 01:29.519
- In fact, why am I here at all?
- The Bancroft family asked for us specifically.

01:29.589 --> 01:33.457
- They got some kind of pull?
- The Bancroft Wing at theJeffersonian.

01:33.526 --> 01:35.858
<i>Sixty million bucks</i>
<i>will buy a lot of good will.</i>

01:35.929 --> 01:39.558
- <i>Typical.</i>
- This dried crust here at the mouth...

01:39.632 --> 01:42.362
When the jugular's cut,
the air mixes with venous blood...

01:42.435 --> 01:44.528
and the negative pressure
causes an air embolism.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.801
- <i>Death is very quick.</i>
- So just sit there and stop complainin'.

01:47.874 --> 01:49.535
- <i>[Brennan] Bound.</i>
- <i>Multiple stab wounds.</i>

01:49.609 --> 01:51.543
<i>We need photos of these spatter patterns.</i>

01:51.611 --> 01:53.977
I bet this statue's worth
more than my house.

01:54.047 --> 01:57.574
You know, you should ask your therapist
about your issues with rich people.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.982
You're in therapy?

02:00.053 --> 02:03.147
- You've seen the socks.
- [Chuckles]

02:03.223 --> 02:05.714
<i>The victim's wife's in the kitchen.</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:09.091
I was... I was at the Vineyard for a month...

02:09.162 --> 02:13.826
and Terry was supposed
to be at his fishing camp in Idaho...

02:13.900 --> 02:15.834
<i>so the house was closed up.</i>

02:15.902 --> 02:18.234
And you didn't try to contact him
at all during that time?

02:20.006 --> 02:22.270
We spoke three weeks ago.

02:22.342 --> 02:26.278
Um, the day before
he was supposed to leave.

02:26.346 --> 02:29.110
<i>The cabin doesn't get cell service.</i>

02:32.018 --> 02:35.749
I heard the officers talking
about a possible home invasion.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.687
Definite possibility.

02:37.757 --> 02:40.055
Well, Terry supports
a youth center...

02:40.126 --> 02:42.117
on the other side
of the Anacostia River.

02:42.195 --> 02:44.060
Rough neighborhood. Tough kids.

02:44.130 --> 02:46.064
I was always afraid to go there...

02:46.132 --> 02:48.259
but he said it was because
I didn't really know them.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.633
Yeah. Listen, I'd like you to, uh, put a list...

02:51.704 --> 02:54.798
of things together
that might have gone missing...

02:54.874 --> 02:58.275
- and, uh, give me a call.
- Okay.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.378
[Beeping]

03:01.714 --> 03:03.807
- That the Bancroft case?
- Yeah.

03:03.883 --> 03:06.909
Looks like a home-invasion homicide, right?

03:06.986 --> 03:10.820
Yes. I'm running dental records now.
Cam is finishing up the autopsy.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.915
But Booth is pretty sure
it's Terry Bancroft?

03:12.992 --> 03:15.392
<i>Yes. There was a lot of insect activity.</i>

03:15.461 --> 03:17.395
Samples are at your work station.

03:17.463 --> 03:19.931
<i>Also the extension cord</i>
<i>used to tie him up...</i>

03:19.999 --> 03:22.092
<i>and everything that was</i>
<i>on top ofhis desk.</i>

03:22.168 --> 03:24.261
He was tied up?

03:24.337 --> 03:27.966
His heart was perforated, but there's
no blood in the thoracic cavity.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.975
He was stabbed after
he was already dead.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.341
What-What killed him?

03:32.412 --> 03:34.346
His jugular was punctured.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.905
Multiple stabs are congruent
with killers jacked on crystal meth...

03:36.983 --> 03:39.144
- or just plain adrenaline.
- Why kill him?

03:39.219 --> 03:42.347
No sign of forced entry.
He probably knew his attackers.

03:42.422 --> 03:45.016
- We have a match.
- <i>[Beeping]</i>

03:45.091 --> 03:48.322
<i>Confirmed. Terrance Bancroft.</i>

03:48.394 --> 03:50.487
He knew his killers?

03:50.563 --> 03:53.293
Are you all right?

03:53.366 --> 03:56.130
Yes. Yeah, absolutely.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.633

- Yeah? Hey.

04:18.057 --> 04:20.048
Hi. Good morning, Angela.

04:20.125 --> 04:23.095
I have blood spatter
patterns on my computer...

04:23.162 --> 04:26.757
- if you need to match them
to anything you have here.
- Uh, yeah, thanks.

04:26.833 --> 04:29.927
I'll come take a look after I get through
with the evidence from the desk.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.870
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.873
Yeah?

04:34.941 --> 04:37.603
- Wanna have lunch later?
- Okay. Yeah.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.393
Would I get to play?

05:36.469 --> 05:39.063
Uh, no. You will be cheering and watching.

05:39.138 --> 05:42.437
- What fun is that?
- I am a mad "sagger."

05:44.210 --> 05:46.872
l-l-I wear my shorts very, very low.

05:46.946 --> 05:49.608
- Okay.
- [Laughs]

05:49.682 --> 05:53.618
You suck hugely at being a girl.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.779
Okay, okay. Anthropology. Anthropology.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.119
Oh, okay. Think of it
as a social ritual...

05:58.191 --> 06:01.251
in which I impress you
with my manly prowess...

06:01.327 --> 06:03.261
during a game of basketball.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.388
- You wanna impress me?
- I'm traditional that way.

06:05.465 --> 06:08.559
Why don't you just bonk me
on the head with a giant club?

06:08.634 --> 06:11.501
I'd much prefer you came
to the game and ogled my butt crack.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.233
You know, it's law enforcement
versus public defenders.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.741
Guys with ponytails
and love handles. You know?

06:16.809 --> 06:19.243
We're heavily favored.
[Imitates Swoosh]

06:19.312 --> 06:21.303
So?

06:30.790 --> 06:32.758
Hi, Clarissa.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.590
Jack. I...

06:36.662 --> 06:40.257
- <i>You heard about Terry?</i>
- Can I come in?

06:48.207 --> 06:51.176
Last time I saw you,
you didn't have a beard.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.338
Yeah, last time you saw me,
I couldn't grow a beard.

06:55.515 --> 06:58.143
I'm sorry about Terry.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.378
<i>Makes everything that happened</i>
<i>between us look...</i>

07:00.453 --> 07:02.387
Meaningless.

07:04.123 --> 07:06.091
<i>Just... a lot less important...</i>

07:06.159 --> 07:08.559
than it seemed at the time.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.858
I got over us, Clarissa.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.525
Then how come it took
Terry getting murdered...

07:14.600 --> 07:16.568
for you to show up at our door?

07:24.544 --> 07:26.512
Where did you get this?

07:26.579 --> 07:29.514
I work at theJeffersonian Institution.
I'm on the case.

07:29.582 --> 07:31.914
- This showed up with the evidence.
- I don't understand.

07:31.984 --> 07:35.442
- Why are you bringing it to me?
- If my bosses were aware that I knew the victim...

07:35.521 --> 07:38.513
or his wife, they'd remove me
from the investigation...

07:38.591 --> 07:42.049
and I would really like to help catch
whatever son of a bitch murdered my friend.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.995
So if someone introduces us...

07:45.064 --> 07:49.262
"Nice to meet you, Ms. Bancroft."
"And you too, Dr. Hodgins."

07:49.335 --> 07:51.326
Got it.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.374
<i>Jack?</i>

07:56.442 --> 07:58.376
Terry and I were...

07:58.444 --> 08:00.378
[Clears Throat]

08:00.446 --> 08:02.380
having some marital problems.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.678
<i>But we were getting through it.</i>

08:04.750 --> 08:07.275
That's gonna make me
a suspect, isn't it?

08:07.353 --> 08:09.821
I can't talk about it, Clarissa.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.225
<i>Terry. Man, we're really gonna</i>
<i>miss that guy around this place.</i>

08:18.297 --> 08:20.231
Foot the bill for this place?

08:20.299 --> 08:22.392
Oh, you know, he was more
than a checkbook.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.663
I mean, Terry,
he took a personal interest.

08:24.737 --> 08:26.864
How personal?

08:26.939 --> 08:28.873
[Chuckles]
Don't even go there, man.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.273
I mean, Terry, he was one of the good guys.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.369
- Those kids are pretty hard core? huh?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:33.446 --> 08:36.904
- Drugs, gangs, violence.
- Any recent arguments or incidents?

08:39.150 --> 08:42.678
Well, apparently, the night before
Terry was gonna head up to his cabin...

08:42.755 --> 08:44.814
he caught a kid with
a couple pounds of heroin.

08:44.891 --> 08:46.950
A couple pounds?
The kid was a mule?

08:47.026 --> 08:49.324
Yeah. He was runnin' deliveries
to Baltimore on the bus.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.454
<i>Did you see Bancroft</i>
<i>take the drugs from the kid?</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:54.830
- No.
- How about any of these kids? Did they see it?

08:54.901 --> 08:57.768
Sure, yeah, until you ask 'em.
Then nobody saw nothin'.

08:57.837 --> 09:00.305
- Did Bancroft call the police?
- Oh, man, come on.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.171
If we did that, no kid would ever
set foot back in this place.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.369
Oh. Then what, huh?
Flushed it down the toilet?

09:05.444 --> 09:07.742
<i>No, no, it's not like that. I mean, Terry...</i>

09:07.813 --> 09:10.111
He would always deliver
whatever he snagged to the cops.

09:10.182 --> 09:12.173
Otherwise the supplier would
think they would get ripped off...

09:12.251 --> 09:14.185
and then the mule ends up dead.

09:14.253 --> 09:16.744
So this is Julio Diaz's locker.

09:19.025 --> 09:22.586
<i>Oh. Blood on the kid's sweatshirt.</i>

09:22.662 --> 09:24.960
No, no. Julio would never kill anybody.

09:25.031 --> 09:26.965
He might deliver drugs,
but he really liked Terry.

09:27.033 --> 09:30.764
What, maybeJulio's supplier?

09:30.836 --> 09:33.031
When was the last time
Julio was here?

09:33.105 --> 09:35.300
The day Terry took the heroin.

09:41.614 --> 09:43.377
<i>All right, look.</i>

09:43.449 --> 09:46.646
If it wasn't for Terry Bancroft,
this place wouldn't exist.

09:46.719 --> 09:51.122
<i>Come on. I need one witness who saw</i>
<i>Terry take the dope from Julio Diaz.</i>

09:51.190 --> 09:53.158
Just one.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.164
[Exhales]
Sorry, man.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.366
<i>[Angela] What is not to like?</i>

10:04.437 --> 10:07.668
- Go watch Sully play basketball.
- He still hasn't made a move on me.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.106
How many times have you gone out?

10:10.176 --> 10:12.406
Four... or six...

10:12.478 --> 10:14.605
depending on how you define "go out."

10:14.680 --> 10:16.910
Great. Bumping into
each other at the diner...

10:16.983 --> 10:18.951
does not count as going out.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.316
Four. There.

10:21.387 --> 10:24.914
Along the interior cervical vertebrae.
Is that shadow a glitch?

10:24.991 --> 10:27.186
I don't do glitches. Four, huh?

10:27.259 --> 10:31.696
<i>So the question is,</i>
<i>is this Sully damaged goods...</i>

10:31.764 --> 10:35.097
- <i>or is hejust very respectful?</i>
- Those are my choices?

10:35.167 --> 10:37.567
Damaged goods, you run away.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.105
<i>Very respectful, you hang in.</i>

10:40.172 --> 10:42.163
I should just make the first move.

10:42.241 --> 10:46.200
No, Brennan, for once, can you
just pretend that you are the girl?

10:46.278 --> 10:49.111
Why is everyone so anxious
for me to be a girl?

10:49.181 --> 10:51.308
Listen. Go to the basketball game...

10:51.384 --> 10:54.751
let him show off for you,
and see what happens.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.118
I don't know. It sounds so passive.

10:57.189 --> 11:00.454
- Now you've got it.
- <i>[Booth] You just don't get it.</i>

11:00.526 --> 11:02.926
What? I'm asking for guy advice.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.793
You are a guy. What's not to get?

11:05.865 --> 11:07.799
First of all, guys...
They don't ask for advice.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.392
- And I'm not gonna help you
get my partner into bed.
- Why not?

11:10.469 --> 11:12.562
It's not like you want her.

11:12.638 --> 11:15.106
<i>Unless...</i>

11:15.174 --> 11:17.108
Do you want her?

11:17.176 --> 11:20.270
- Aw, come on, huh?
Bones is, you know, my partner.
- <i>[Laughs]</i>

11:20.346 --> 11:22.610
That is why you need
psychiatric treatment...

11:22.682 --> 11:24.616
because you have the hots
for your partner.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.618
I'm not in psychiatric
treatment, okay?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.484
- It's an evaluation. Big difference.
- <i>I can tell...</i>

11:29.555 --> 11:33.047
that Brennan is the go-slow type,
but you gotta help me out on how slow...

11:33.125 --> 11:35.150
because too slow is worse
than not slow enough.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.159
- Agent Booth?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

11:38.230 --> 11:40.892
District cops got a kid matching your A.P. B...
down at the morgue.

11:42.902 --> 11:46.633
<i>John Doe number 120806.</i>

11:46.706 --> 11:49.402
Male, approximately 14 years old.

11:49.475 --> 11:53.138
His body was found under
the Anacostia Bridge on the sixth.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.305
<i>That was almost 20 days ago.</i>

11:55.381 --> 11:59.477
l-l-I think that's Julio.
That's definitely his gold chain, for sure.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.648
- Cause of death?
- Single gunshot wound to the back of the head.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.782
- Execution style.
- Yeah, if, uh...

12:05.858 --> 12:07.792
lfTerry hadn't gotten
the drugs to the cops...

12:07.860 --> 12:09.794
the supplier would have
come afterJulio.

12:09.862 --> 12:13.320
Terry Bancroft got killed for that heroin.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.765
<i>Dr. Brennan saw a shadow on the X-rays.</i>

12:16.836 --> 12:21.000
- I removed the tissue from
the bones and found a fungus.
- Not odd.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.064
If you were decomposing
for three weeks...

12:23.142 --> 12:25.303
you'd probably work up
a fungus or two as well.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.368
The interior cervical vertebrae.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.437
Spell it out, bone boy.

12:29.515 --> 12:34.179
The jugular was cut,
and the blood pooled here.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.222
<i>He was lying on his back</i>
<i>for several hours.</i>

12:37.289 --> 12:39.553
- <i>[Booth] Anything new?</i>
- Yes.

12:39.625 --> 12:42.617
The victim was killed
by the puncturing of his jugular...

12:42.695 --> 12:44.492
left lying there for several hours.

12:44.563 --> 12:47.896
- <i>Then the murderer came back...</i>
- Forced the body into his chair.

12:47.967 --> 12:52.631
- And stabbed him 14 more times.
- Oh, to make it look like a home invasion.

12:52.705 --> 12:56.300
The blood on Julio's sweatshirt found
in the locker was definitely Bancroft's.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.866
Well, that doesn't make sense.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.208
Bancroft confiscates the kid's dope.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.306
Kid runs to the supplier.
They go to Bancroft's place...

13:04.383 --> 13:06.817
<i>scare him into telling them</i>
<i>where the dope is, then kill him.</i>

13:06.886 --> 13:10.185
- Only that doesn't scan.
I mean, why murder the kid?
- 'Cause he was there.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.190
'Cause he cried.
'Cause he blew his nose on a red hankie.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.419
- They don't need much reason.
- Well, I don't like it.

13:14.493 --> 13:17.553
Doesn't mean it's not true.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.565
Calliphora vomitoria.
<i>Prepupal stage of the third instar.</i>

13:20.633 --> 13:24.433
- <i>Does that give us a postmortem interval?</i>
- 18.5 days.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.494
Oh, you can be
that accurate from flies?

13:26.572 --> 13:29.905
D.O.J. Forensics has new
statistical models of maggot growth...

13:29.975 --> 13:32.409
that pinpoint death
within a six-hour window.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.003
- Hmm. Then I was right.
- About what?

13:35.080 --> 13:37.514
Julio Diaz was killed 20 days ago.

13:37.583 --> 13:41.041
18.5 days ago is after
his body was found.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.918
Then how did Bancroft's blood
get on Julio's sweatshirt?

13:43.989 --> 13:46.287
Julio Diaz was dead
under that bridge.

13:46.358 --> 13:49.350
Somebody else put that blood
on his sweatshirt.

13:57.203 --> 13:59.535

- In point of fact, it is therapy.
- What?

14:32.338 --> 14:34.306
No. No, it's not. It's an evaluation.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.604
No. I've already certified you as fit
to carry a gun and go back to work.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.610
Okay, then why are we meeting?

14:39.678 --> 14:42.806
Well, because you discharged
your weapon at an ice cream truck.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.612
My <i>provisional</i> certification
of your mental health...

14:45.684 --> 14:48.778
only holds as long as
you continue to meet with me.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.788
Great. For how long?

14:50.856 --> 14:53.950
Till I'm satisfied that you won't
start firing at confectioners again.

14:54.026 --> 14:56.290
- What's your objection to therapy?
- [Laughs]

14:56.362 --> 14:59.923
You know what, Doc? I am not
the kind of guy who's got anything to hide.

14:59.999 --> 15:03.901
Do you know, I often find that
when people declare what they are not...

15:03.969 --> 15:05.994
it almost invariably turns out...

15:06.071 --> 15:08.562
that's precisely what they are.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.610
Great. Then you know what?
No more declarations from me.

15:11.677 --> 15:14.237
[Chuckles]
You do know that what you just said is, in fact...

15:14.313 --> 15:16.781
the very avatar of a declaration.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.783
Avatar. That's great.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.183
- Can I get a cup of coffee and, uh...
- Tea, please.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.414
- Sure.
- Tea. Let me ask you a question, Doc.

15:23.489 --> 15:26.925
Why is it that every time you introduce
yourself, you always say your name twice?

15:26.992 --> 15:29.893
[With English Accent]
"Hello. My name is Gordon... Gordon Wyatt."

15:29.962 --> 15:31.896
Well, now you're simply
lashing out, aren't you?

15:31.964 --> 15:34.592
Why don't we talk about the case
you're working on at the moment?

15:34.667 --> 15:37.761
- What?
- Well, I am trained as a forensic psychiatrist.

15:37.836 --> 15:40.430
- I might be able to help.
- Okay. Fine. Great.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.168
I have a dead rich guy,
works with at-risk youth...

15:43.242 --> 15:46.837
gets brutally murdered after confiscating
a couple of pounds of heroin...

15:46.912 --> 15:48.846
from one of his kids.

15:48.914 --> 15:51.382
Interesting the first word
you use to describe him is "rich."

15:51.450 --> 15:54.248
Ah. Second. First description was "dead."

15:54.320 --> 15:56.550
Why do you think you have
a problem with wealthy people?

15:56.622 --> 16:00.524
In this case, a perfect example.
This guy, he makes up his own rules.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.526
- What's that word that you used?
- Uh, entitled.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.892
Yeah. Entitled. That's what got him killed.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.432
Did this rich guy
by any chance have a wife?

16:07.499 --> 16:10.866
- Are we changing the subject now?
- And does the rich guy's wife have a lover?

16:10.936 --> 16:12.870
I just told you.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.702
The murder has to do
with the heroin.

16:15.774 --> 16:19.232
The boy the victim took the heroin from
also turned up murdered.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.905
And is this boy
from a modest background?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.415
- Doesn't get any "modester."
- So is there any chance...

16:24.483 --> 16:27.008
that you would rather catch
the boy's murderer...

16:27.086 --> 16:29.247
than the wealthy fellow's murderer...

16:29.321 --> 16:32.415
so you have decided
that they're one and the same?

16:32.491 --> 16:34.425
Any chance that you've
based this assumption...

16:34.493 --> 16:38.122
purely on your bias against rich,
entitled people?

16:38.197 --> 16:40.131
Hmm. You know what?

16:40.199 --> 16:42.929
I did the belt buckle, I did the tie,
I did the socks...

16:43.002 --> 16:45.027
What else do you want from me?

16:49.141 --> 16:51.769
What would you say if I told you...

16:51.844 --> 16:56.440
that my name actually <i>is</i>
Gordon Gordon Wyatt...

16:56.515 --> 16:58.483
that my first and middle names...

16:58.550 --> 17:01.246
are the same?

17:01.320 --> 17:03.413
- Yeah, baby!
- Oh, yeah.

17:03.489 --> 17:05.423
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Good game, man.</i>

17:05.491 --> 17:07.482
Hey. Hi.

17:09.627 --> 17:12.256
- So, ready to go?
- Don't you want to take a shower?

17:12.330 --> 17:15.960
- Aw, I don't sweat that much.
- Won't you be uncomfortable at the restaurant?

17:16.035 --> 17:19.060
It's a scuzzy bar. I'll be one
of the best-smelling things there...

17:19.137 --> 17:22.266
- <i>Next to you, of course.</i>
- You played very well.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.332
Thank you.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.377
In fact, you were the best.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.913
See, that's why I wanted you
to come... to be impressed.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.074
Well, it was an impressive
display of manhood.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.084
[Laughs]
Well, thank you.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.177
Athletics as an analog for battle.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.654
In effect, you were
a warrior tonight.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.352
[Laughs]
Wow. You really were impressed.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.486
There are quite a number of ways...

17:43.562 --> 17:45.826
that men judge their relative maleness...

17:45.898 --> 17:47.832
- with respect to other men.
- Uh-huh.

17:47.900 --> 17:52.132
Muscles, income, cars.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.604
<i>Attractive mates,</i>
<i>tolerance to alcohol.</i>

17:54.673 --> 17:57.938
Hair loss, and, of course,
the-the size of sexual organs.

17:58.010 --> 18:01.411
Ho! Save something
for us to discuss at dinner.

18:01.480 --> 18:04.347
Well, women don't care about that.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.044
- Dinner or hair loss?
- [Laughs]

18:07.119 --> 18:09.713
The size of the sexual organ.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.756
Ours or yours?

18:12.825 --> 18:15.225
Penis size only matters
to other males.

18:15.294 --> 18:18.661
See, I was hoping you'd comment on
how I shut down the other team's offense.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.664
Well, their offense wasn't
really all that good.

18:20.732 --> 18:23.098
Oh, you know how to hurt a guy.

18:23.168 --> 18:26.331
That's not a bad thing. I like it.
A little sauce. Little zing.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.403
The flake on the trachea was india ink.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.704
It came from this.
It's a scrimshawed letter opener.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.710
Wiped clean, but there are
still minute traces...

18:32.778 --> 18:35.372
ofTerrance Bancroft's
blood in the etchings.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.219
I need to pull a little con on the wife.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.586
- <i>Your wife?</i>
- No, the victim's wife.

18:45.657 --> 18:48.421
- Wh-Why?
- Find out if she was cheating on her husband.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.154
I thought the murder
was because of the heroin.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.393
<i>Well, it is, but I need you</i>
<i>to come along...</i>

18:55.467 --> 18:57.935
and collect some dust
or pollen or seeds...

18:58.003 --> 18:59.766
or whatever the hell it is you do...

18:59.838 --> 19:02.830
so I can get in and figure out
if she's got anything to hide.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.968
- How will you do that?
- Oh, I've got my ways. Come on.

19:06.044 --> 19:10.276
Wow. You know, I'm really busy here.
You know, with the murder weapon.

19:10.349 --> 19:14.217
Plus we found a fiber in the victim's throat.
It's actually muskrat.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.083
That's a perfect cover.
We'll go to the mansion.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.454
You go inside, look for anything
made out of muskrat. Come on.

19:21.293 --> 19:23.227
Why you draggin' your feet? Let's go.

19:23.295 --> 19:26.162
- I'll-I'll-I'll get my kit.
- Get your kit.

19:30.302 --> 19:32.236
Good evening, Ms. Bancroft.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.966
This is Dr. Hodgins
from theJeffersonian.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.372
- I was wondering if...
- Very pleased to meet you.

19:37.442 --> 19:40.809
Nice to meet you, Dr. Hodgins.
Clarissa Bancroft.

19:42.781 --> 19:45.409
Dr. Hodgins needs
to take a look inside...

19:45.484 --> 19:47.418
in the den, if that's all right.

19:47.486 --> 19:51.286
- Oh. What are you looking for?
- Muskrat.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.093
[Sighs]

19:55.160 --> 19:57.424
How long will Dr. Hodgins be in there?

19:57.496 --> 20:00.761
Oh, you know, a homicide investigation
is pretty invasive.

20:00.832 --> 20:03.960
Both the family and the victim
lose all their privacy.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.470
I understand.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.506
Do you?

20:11.076 --> 20:13.010
Because, uh...

20:13.078 --> 20:16.809
it's inevitable that we find out everything.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.942
What kind of doctor is Jack?

20:20.018 --> 20:22.646
Bugs. Slime.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.686
<i>You know that I had an affair.</i>

20:31.763 --> 20:34.197
It's best you tell me everything.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.633
It ended three months ago.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.331
Terry and I were working through it.

20:41.406 --> 20:45.672
- Separate vacations?
- I didn't say it wasn't difficult.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.907
<i>You can love someone</i>
<i>and still hurt them.</i>

20:48.981 --> 20:51.108

- Yeah.

20:51.183 --> 20:53.117
<i>Leland Oliver.</i>

20:53.185 --> 20:55.949
He's our financial consultant.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.955

20:58.023 --> 21:01.584
<i>I would have gotten</i>
<i>at most half ofhis money.</i>

21:01.660 --> 21:05.118

that better than anyone.

21:05.197 --> 21:08.064
<i>That's exactly why</i>
<i>I didn't say anything earlier.</i>

21:08.133 --> 21:11.068
How'd you know Dr. Hodgins's first name?

21:11.136 --> 21:14.503
- You introduced us.
- I never said his first name.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.803
Just tell him, Clarissa.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.876
All right, look, I'm sorry,
but it doesn't change anything.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.576
- Hey, this is not a problem.
- Not a problem. Not a problem, huh?

21:25.651 --> 21:27.585
I ought to arrest you
for tampering with evidence.

21:27.653 --> 21:31.350
This goes to trial, you are in Ibiza
or Antarctica, on vacation.

21:41.366 --> 21:44.096
Hodgins, what is the significance
of the muskrat fur?

21:44.169 --> 21:48.162
Yeah, Hodgins, what is the significance
of the muskrat fur?

21:48.240 --> 21:50.970
Muskrats have an under layer of fur.

21:51.043 --> 21:54.376
The outer layer is coarse hair.
This-This is muskrat hair.

21:54.446 --> 21:56.380
Fur, hair.
[Chuckles]

21:56.448 --> 21:59.906
I doubt our victim's jugular
was cut by a muskrat.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.919
Is there something going on?

22:01.987 --> 22:03.955
You wanna tell 'em?

22:05.657 --> 22:07.887
Muskrat hair was colored

<i>That's the one Robert Frazier was wearing.</i>

22:21.873 --> 22:24.933
- The director of the youth drop-in center.
- Then we have our murderer.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.444
Good job, Hodgins.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.946
No, not good job, Hodgins.
He might have blown the whole case.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.949
I told him it is not a problem.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.485
- <i>[Brennan] What happened?</i>
- I don't care what he does on his time off.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.953
<i>When he screws with evidence</i>
<i>to get in the pants of an old girlfriend...</i>

22:37.022 --> 22:39.855
on one of my murder cases,
that's a problem.

22:54.973 --> 22:59.069
<i>I already got no proof</i>
<i>how the victim got hold of that heroin.</i>

22:59.144 --> 23:01.374
Now you're saying I can't
put Hodgins on the stand? Why?

23:01.446 --> 23:03.505
- You don't want to know the answer.
- [Brennan] Why doesn't she?

23:03.582 --> 23:09.282
As the prosecutor in this case, I'm obliged
to share everything I know with the defense.

23:09.354 --> 23:12.812
- Just because Clarissa Bancroft and I...
- Whoa, whoa. Good night.

23:12.891 --> 23:16.122
Did you not hear what she just said?

23:16.194 --> 23:19.027
There are some things
she can't know.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.588
Clarissa and I were engaged.

23:21.666 --> 23:24.658
- [Exhales]
- She and Terry started something up...

23:24.736 --> 23:27.534
and it unfolded the way
those things do.

23:27.606 --> 23:30.939
<i>I haven't contacted or heard</i>
<i>from either of them in eight years.</i>

23:31.009 --> 23:34.103
- Then Terry got killed...
- And like every other rich guy in the world...

23:34.179 --> 23:36.443
you decided that rules
just didn't apply to you.

23:36.515 --> 23:39.712
Hey, the guy used to be my friend,
all right? And Clarissa...

23:39.785 --> 23:43.277
- You tampered with evidence.
- The glass and frame were evidence.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.687
The photograph I removed was not.

23:48.460 --> 23:52.055
I wanted to work Terry's murder.

23:53.365 --> 23:56.061
Obviously, you're off the case.

23:56.134 --> 23:58.967
- Should be off the job.
- That is not your decision, Booth.

23:59.037 --> 24:01.198
I apologize.

24:03.141 --> 24:05.803
I will deal with this
however you see fit.

24:09.948 --> 24:13.679
<i>[Caroline]</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of thejury...</i>

24:13.752 --> 24:17.415
my good friend Mr. Barron
is gonna give you a long speech...

24:17.489 --> 24:19.684
about what reasonable doubt is.

24:19.758 --> 24:22.750
He's mostly gonna be right.

24:22.828 --> 24:25.319
But facts are facts,
ladies and gentlemen...

24:25.397 --> 24:28.764
<i>and the fact is, Mr. Robert Frazier killed...</i>

24:28.834 --> 24:31.496
<i>Mr. Terrance Bancroft...</i>

24:31.570 --> 24:33.902
<i>for a few pounds ofheroin.</i>

24:33.972 --> 24:37.271
They've got anthropologists
and psychiatrists...

24:37.342 --> 24:41.608
<i>and particulate experts</i>
<i>and blood experts...</i>

24:41.680 --> 24:46.083
the whole weight
of theJeffersonian Institution...

24:46.151 --> 24:50.247
all interpreting the facts for you.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.347
<i>And I stress the word "interpret"...</i>

24:52.424 --> 24:55.222
<i>because you, as thejury...</i>

24:55.293 --> 24:58.057
are the arbiters of common sense...

24:58.129 --> 25:01.098
that gets lost in all the science.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.691
Would you describe
how the victim was killed?

25:03.768 --> 25:08.364
Mr. Bancroft died when a sharp instrument
was thrust into his jugular.

25:08.440 --> 25:12.240
<i>This is a dried fleck of india ink</i>
<i>left in the victim's trachea.</i>

25:12.310 --> 25:17.304
It matches the ink on a scrimshawed
letter opener the F.B.I. found at the scene.

25:17.382 --> 25:20.215
<i>Postmortem, the vicious attack</i>
<i>on the victim continued.</i>

25:20.285 --> 25:24.312
<i>Objection. Categorization</i>
<i>of the attack as vicious is prejudicial.</i>

25:24.389 --> 25:26.721
Fourteen times a man was stabbed.

25:26.791 --> 25:30.784
- How many stabs does it take
to be vicious, exactly?
- Sustained.

25:30.862 --> 25:34.593
Using a 2-D image
from a stereo microscope...

25:34.666 --> 25:36.964
<i>I was able to create</i>
<i>a three-dimensional model.</i>

25:37.035 --> 25:40.163
These kerf marks are congruent
with a double-edged blade...

25:40.238 --> 25:42.900
<i>one side serrated, the other not.</i>

25:42.974 --> 25:46.967
Yeah, that's the knife we found
in the tool box in Robert Frazier's truck.

25:47.045 --> 25:50.242
That would explain the prints
found by the F.B.I. forensics lab?

25:50.315 --> 25:53.443
Explain the prints,
but not the victim's blood.

25:53.518 --> 25:57.181
Yeah, this is the jacket Robert Frazier
was wearing at the time of his arrest.

25:57.255 --> 26:00.122
<i>[Brennan] The hair on the left came</i>
<i>from the victim's larynx.</i>

26:00.191 --> 26:02.284
The hair on the right
came from the jacket.

26:02.360 --> 26:05.158
And they came from the same jacket?

26:05.230 --> 26:08.791
- They came from the same muskrat.
- [Laughing]

26:08.867 --> 26:12.166
How did this hair get
into the victim's larynx?

26:12.237 --> 26:15.798
The larynx and the trachea were both
punctured by the murder weapon...

26:15.874 --> 26:18.809
and that was most logically achieved
by the murderer...

26:18.877 --> 26:22.438
<i>approaching the victim from behind,</i>
<i>putting a choke hold on him...</i>

26:22.514 --> 26:26.006
and plunging the murder weapon
into his throat.

26:26.084 --> 26:29.542
In doing so, the murderer inadvertently
stabbed through his own jacket...

26:29.621 --> 26:32.852
<i>thus depositing the muskrat hair</i>
<i>in the victim's throat.</i>

26:32.924 --> 26:35.324
<i>Let the record show</i>
<i>that the witness...</i>

26:35.393 --> 26:38.055
is wiggling his finger through the jacket
in a very convincing manner.

26:38.129 --> 26:41.394
Objection to the use of the phrase
"very convincing manner."

26:41.466 --> 26:43.457
- Sustained.
- Why?

26:43.535 --> 26:46.402
- Why what?
- Why was Terrance Bancroft killed?

26:46.471 --> 26:49.372
<i>Did you discover</i>
<i>a motive, Agent Booth?</i>

26:52.143 --> 26:54.737
I need five minutes, Your Honor.

27:00.619 --> 27:04.555
Look, man, I saw Terry
take the dope from Julio.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.887
I don't see how this is gonna
help burn Frazier though.

27:06.958 --> 27:10.826
It's called "chain of evidence."
It'll help, okay? Trust me.

27:10.895 --> 27:13.193
I'll say what I saw.

27:13.264 --> 27:16.597
- Terry was a good man.
- So are you. Come on.

27:16.668 --> 27:19.364
Let's go.

27:19.437 --> 27:21.735
Terry was, like,
"Open that bag, Julio."

27:21.806 --> 27:25.333
- <i>[Caroline] What did Julio do?</i>
- Just stood there.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.140
Terry went over,
took the bag from him.

27:28.213 --> 27:31.341
He opened it up. It was packed
with pounds of blast.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.384
Tell the jury what that means.

27:33.451 --> 27:36.545
Heroin. At least two bricks.

27:36.621 --> 27:39.215
And, like, everybody knows what
happens ifTerry catches you holding.

27:39.290 --> 27:41.224
You get sent out for 72 hours.

27:41.292 --> 27:43.726
- And the drugs?
- Straight to the police.

27:43.795 --> 27:48.755
You believe Robert Frazier killed
Terrance Bancroft for that heroin?

27:48.833 --> 27:51.563
<i>Yes. Robert Frazier</i>
<i>turned out to be a junkie.</i>

27:51.636 --> 27:53.604
That's why he wore
that jacket all the time.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.698
- Objection. Assuming facts not in evidence.
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

27:56.775 --> 28:01.075
The defendant has every needle disease
in the book except H.I.V.

28:01.146 --> 28:03.307
Same objection...
Plus, Miss Julian seems...

28:03.381 --> 28:05.906
to deeply desire to <i>testify</i> herself.

28:05.984 --> 28:09.044
I would like to <i>testify,</i> because then
I would know what answers I was getting.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.054
- [Laughing]
- <i>[Judge] All right, settle down.</i>

28:11.122 --> 28:14.717
This is a murder trial,
not a night at the Improv.

28:14.793 --> 28:18.820
<i>The victim was killed and left</i>
<i>for between 10 and 15 hours.</i>

28:18.897 --> 28:21.957
<i>The murderer returned</i>
<i>and forced him into the chair.</i>

28:22.033 --> 28:24.729
This was also when
he was stabbed 14 times.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.896
That 10 to 15 hours
gave the murderer time...

28:26.971 --> 28:30.168
to soakJulio Diaz's sweatshirt
in the victim's blood...

28:30.241 --> 28:34.473
in order to put the blame on either
Mr. Diaz or the drug suppliers.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.810
But you do not believe
that the defendant killed the boy?

28:36.881 --> 28:38.815
No, but he might as well have.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.477
- Objection.
- I'll hear it.

28:41.553 --> 28:45.580
Terrance Bancroft intended
to give that heroin to the police...

28:45.657 --> 28:50.253
- in order to keepJulio Diaz
square with his suppliers.
- Thank you.

28:50.328 --> 28:53.593
- Julio Diaz was 14 years old.
- Your Honor!

28:53.665 --> 28:57.761
The prosecution apologizes,
Your Honor, and rests.

29:00.205 --> 29:02.196
Wait. You still
haven't slept together?

29:02.273 --> 29:05.037
- I know the problem.
- Is it religious upbringing?

29:05.110 --> 29:07.874
- His penis.
- What's wrong with it?

29:07.946 --> 29:11.177
- Apparently, it's small.
- [Laughs]

29:11.249 --> 29:15.208
Well, that maybe explains why
he hasn't made any moves on you yet.

29:15.286 --> 29:18.881
He's insecure, so I should make
the first move, right?

29:18.957 --> 29:22.051
Yeah. Take Sully
for a little test drive.

29:22.127 --> 29:24.618
Maybe he's got unlimited mileage.

29:24.696 --> 29:27.631
That'll make up for the fact
that he's a sub-compact.

29:29.067 --> 29:32.730
<i>Doc, what we're doing here,</i>
<i>would that be considered therapy?</i>

29:32.804 --> 29:35.568
Oh, absolutely, especially since
I'm about to inquire...

29:35.640 --> 29:37.574
whether you've experienced
any outbursts of temper...

29:37.642 --> 29:40.236
since I requested
you alter your dress code.

29:40.311 --> 29:43.508
Yeah. One of the squints... Hodgins...

29:43.581 --> 29:45.776
<i>decided the rules,</i>
<i>they didn't apply to him.</i>

29:45.850 --> 29:48.978
<i>He got entitled</i>
<i>andjeopardized my murder case.</i>

29:49.053 --> 29:50.987
Ah. And you confronted him physically?

29:51.055 --> 29:53.182
Physical confrontation...
that's my main skill.

29:53.258 --> 29:56.853
"Entitled," you said.
Is he a wealthy man?

29:56.928 --> 29:59.726
- Yeah, like the guy who got killed.
- <i>The murder victim...</i>

29:59.798 --> 30:03.598
who... tried to help a child
and then died for it?

30:03.668 --> 30:06.228
- And your... squint?
- Yeah, squint.

30:06.304 --> 30:09.102
Extraordinary.
Your squint tried to help a friend...

30:09.174 --> 30:11.734
so they both endeavored to do good.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.778
With no clue of the way things are.

30:13.845 --> 30:17.337
The way things are as defined
by a working-class lad from Pittsburgh.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.945
That's right. Pittsburgh.
Where I'm from, all right?

30:22.020 --> 30:25.251
From the streets, where you get
a sense of how the world really is.

30:25.323 --> 30:28.918
Yes, I'm sure that's true,
but has it occurred to you...

30:28.993 --> 30:32.292
that without the distortion of reality
provided by a privileged upbringing...

30:32.363 --> 30:35.594
there'd be no such thing
as the Sistine Chapel or Taj Mahal...

30:35.667 --> 30:38.397
or the Three Rivers Stadium,
home of your beloved Steelers?

30:38.469 --> 30:40.403
Three Rivers Stadium
was demolished in 2000.

30:40.471 --> 30:43.031
But it was a great place though.
I mean that Lambert...

30:43.107 --> 30:46.474
No doubt. The point is,
you rebel in your way...

30:46.544 --> 30:49.104
your friend rebels in his.

30:49.180 --> 30:52.081
We all of us have to overcome
our upbringings, rich and poor alike.

30:52.150 --> 30:54.482
You know what?

30:54.552 --> 30:59.580
I'm going to ask you to go back to your
bilious socks and your ostentatious ties...

30:59.657 --> 31:01.750
and your provocative belt buckles.

31:01.826 --> 31:04.590
You're saying, if I wear flashy socks,
I'm going to forgive Hodgins?

31:04.662 --> 31:07.756
[Chuckling]
Oh, Lord. I'm not sure I'm <i>that</i> good.

31:07.832 --> 31:10.164
Well, perhaps I am. Hmm.

31:10.235 --> 31:12.328
Hey, Doc, Doc, Doc, uh...

31:12.403 --> 31:15.566
Why is it that the belt buckle is provocative?

31:15.640 --> 31:19.007
It's a modern-day codpiece.
It forces the eye to the groin.

31:25.350 --> 31:29.616
<i>What process was used to match</i>
<i>the india ink on the letter opener...</i>

31:29.687 --> 31:31.678
<i>with the flake in the victim's trachea?</i>

31:31.756 --> 31:34.850
Hydropneumatic elutriation.
[Laughs]

31:34.926 --> 31:37.861
<i>Which involves dissolving</i>
<i>the sample in a solution, correct?</i>

31:37.929 --> 31:40.454
- Yes.
- Essentially destroying it.

31:40.531 --> 31:42.465
<i>Yes.</i>

31:42.533 --> 31:44.967
And how was the muskrat hair processed?

31:45.036 --> 31:47.630
Liquid chromatograph
mass spectrometry.

31:47.705 --> 31:50.503
<i>And did you perform this test</i>
<i>personally, Dr. Saroyan?</i>

31:50.575 --> 31:55.171
No. It was done by a specialist
at theJeffersonian.

31:55.246 --> 31:58.841
- And who might that be?
- Dr. Jack Hodgins.

31:58.917 --> 32:03.217
<i>The same man who used flies</i>
<i>to estimate the time of death?</i>

32:03.288 --> 32:05.153
Yes.

32:05.223 --> 32:08.124
The same Dr. Jack Hodgins...

32:08.192 --> 32:11.389
who was once engaged to the victim's wife,
Clarissa Bancroft?

32:11.462 --> 32:13.692
Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.632
- Sustained.
- Quite right, Your Honor.

32:16.701 --> 32:19.829
The defense calls
Dr. Jack Hodgins to the stand...

32:19.904 --> 32:24.841
after which we will be moving
for dismissal of all charges.

32:34.786 --> 32:38.119
<i>How do you think they found out</i>
<i>about Hodgins and Clarissa Bancroft?</i>

32:38.189 --> 32:40.123
Aw, it's a classic defense move.

32:40.191 --> 32:42.819
You just check out the wife for motive,
run through the ex-lovers.

32:42.894 --> 32:47.126
Well, the judge didn't dismiss the case,
which is a miracle.

32:47.198 --> 32:50.497
"Better you don't know,
Caroline." Ha.

32:50.568 --> 32:55.767
I figured it was something small,
like a typo on a search warrant, but no.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.741
Turns out Hodgins had motive
to kill the man himself.

32:58.810 --> 33:02.177
Eight years ago, maybe, but not now.
I've got Angela.

33:02.246 --> 33:04.407
Hello. If I might continue.

33:04.482 --> 33:07.042
The judge has allowed you 24 hours...

33:07.118 --> 33:10.519
<i>to come up with additional evidence</i>
<i>that has never been seen...</i>

33:10.588 --> 33:13.955
heard, smelled, touched
or considered by Dr. Hodgins.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.959
Twenty-four hours.

33:18.696 --> 33:21.358
Hodgins was all over this case.

33:21.432 --> 33:25.198
We need something brand new
or something that Hodgins didn't touch.

33:25.269 --> 33:28.033
Uh, both weapons,
blood spatter evidence.

33:28.106 --> 33:32.372
Right. Trace evidence from the scene,
the heroin, the sweatshirt.

33:32.443 --> 33:35.003
- We've covered it all.
- The answer is here, in front of us.

33:35.079 --> 33:37.912
- Just like always.
- W-Well...

33:50.695 --> 33:53.289
- The fungus.
- <i>[Saroyan] What fungus?</i>

33:53.364 --> 33:56.333
The fungus Zack found
along the interior cervical vertebrae.

33:56.401 --> 33:59.302
- Typical cadaver mold.
- <i>[Brennan] Let's have it identified.</i>

33:59.370 --> 34:02.430
- That would usually be Hodgins's job.
- Not this time.

34:13.351 --> 34:15.911
It's my letter of resignation.

34:16.987 --> 34:19.320
Your science was dead-on perfect.

34:19.389 --> 34:22.359
That's all I care about.
I don't need your resignation.

34:28.099 --> 34:30.829
He didn't actually
tamper with evidence.

34:30.902 --> 34:34.496
Dr. Hodgins endangered a case
by hiding his relationship with a suspect.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.699
I'm saving Dr. Saroyan
the trouble of firing me.

34:36.774 --> 34:39.038
Well, how much trouble is it?
"You're fired."

34:39.110 --> 34:42.204
<i>That's no trouble at all.</i>
<i>A child could do it.</i>

34:42.280 --> 34:44.110
I appreciate it.

34:53.524 --> 34:56.982
<i>So we all agree it's</i> Aspergillus.

34:57.061 --> 34:59.894
<i>But there are 185 strains of</i> Aspergillus.

34:59.964 --> 35:04.526
- <i>Clavatus, glaucus, flavus...</i>
- They all look totally alike to me.

35:04.602 --> 35:08.698
No. No, these two are different.

35:08.773 --> 35:13.801
- I don't see it.
- Well, they're both..."puddly."

35:13.878 --> 35:16.108
- "Puddly"?
- Well, by puddly...

35:16.180 --> 35:19.240
I mean the hyphae are septate and hyaline...

35:19.317 --> 35:21.342
and the conidiaphores originate
from the basal foot cell...

35:21.419 --> 35:23.512
<i>Iocated on the supporting hyphae...</i>

35:23.588 --> 35:25.522
<i>and terminate in a vesicle.</i>

35:25.590 --> 35:27.524
<i>Aspergillus ustus.</i>

35:27.592 --> 35:29.719
You found it.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.058
Exactly how much time
have you been spending with Hodgins?

35:49.680 --> 35:51.671
Pie good?

35:56.821 --> 35:58.948
I quit.

35:59.023 --> 36:01.014
<i>Handed in my letter to Cam.</i>

36:01.092 --> 36:03.890
Idiot. Should have got fired.

36:03.961 --> 36:06.191
Now no severance package.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.323
I figure, a guy like you...

36:08.399 --> 36:11.061
I resign, that puts things
right between us.

36:11.135 --> 36:13.433
<i>Do we need to discuss it past that?</i>

36:14.972 --> 36:17.634
What are we, girls?

36:19.310 --> 36:21.574
A piece of pie for my friend.

36:26.150 --> 36:30.382
<i>I will remind thejury that</i>
<i>they have heard previous testimony...</i>

36:30.454 --> 36:32.820
from Dr. Clifford Lonsdale...

36:32.890 --> 36:35.825
<i>a clinical expert in drug addiction.</i>

36:35.893 --> 36:38.919
Why should the jury care
about some Latin infections?

36:38.996 --> 36:41.487
We found a fungus on the victim...

36:41.566 --> 36:43.898
called <i>Aspergillus ustus.</i>

36:43.968 --> 36:47.096
- Is that not very common?
- The fungus in the victim...

36:47.171 --> 36:50.766
matches exactly the strain
Dr. Lonsdale found in the defendant.

36:50.841 --> 36:54.242
- What are the chances of that occurring?
- Incalculable.

36:54.312 --> 36:57.247
Which is something
I've never said before.

36:57.315 --> 36:59.783
<i>Miss Montenegro,</i>
<i>how did this happen?</i>

36:59.850 --> 37:02.785
When the defendant punctured
the victim's jugular...

37:02.853 --> 37:04.821
he nicked himself.

37:04.889 --> 37:08.655
...thus introducing the bacteria
directly into the victim's bloodstream.

37:08.726 --> 37:12.822
The fungus developed only
where blood from the fatal stab pooled...

37:12.897 --> 37:15.331
here, along the spinal cord.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.424
It did not spread
throughout the body.

37:17.501 --> 37:22.029
- Which means...
- That only Mr. Frazier
could have infected the victim...

37:22.106 --> 37:25.075
<i>and only within moments</i>
<i>of the victim's death.</i>

37:25.142 --> 37:29.772
- And who found this fungus?
- <i>Dr. Zack Addy.</i>

37:29.847 --> 37:33.146
- And who identified it?
- <i>Ms. Angela Montenegro.</i>

37:33.217 --> 37:37.677
- And who realized the significance of it?
- I did.

37:37.755 --> 37:41.714
<i>Dr. Jack Hodgins participated</i>
<i>in no way whatsoever?</i>

37:41.792 --> 37:44.454
Objection.
The implication is offensive.

37:44.528 --> 37:48.294
That objection has no standing in law,
Miss Julian. The witness will answer.

37:49.433 --> 37:52.027
Despite the fact
that I have absolute faith...

37:52.103 --> 37:56.335
<i>in Dr. Hodgins's integrity</i>
<i>and objectivity...</i>

37:56.407 --> 37:59.672
in this instance,
he was not involved.

37:59.744 --> 38:02.178
Then the evidence stands.

38:05.216 --> 38:08.344
- [Chattering]
- I don't see how they could do that.

38:08.419 --> 38:10.751
- <i>[Zack] Who?</i>
- Lawyers.

38:10.821 --> 38:12.812
- Do what?
- <i>[Brennan] Be all friendly.</i>

38:12.890 --> 38:15.859
<i>The only people lawyers like</i>
<i>are other lawyers.</i>

38:15.926 --> 38:20.363
Oh, they were married.
They have a daughter, second year at M.I.T.

38:20.431 --> 38:22.695
Does anyone else see the irony here?

38:22.767 --> 38:26.601
Listen up, you people. The verdict
is gonna come down any minute.

38:26.671 --> 38:29.902
Maybe we'll win, maybe we'll lose.
But this I do know...

38:29.974 --> 38:33.501
you people have got to get
your sand together, you hear me?

38:33.577 --> 38:37.445
Booth... and you scientist,
android brainiacs...

38:37.515 --> 38:41.417
you got something very special here,
but you are losing it.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.352
Dropping serial killers
off balconies...

38:44.422 --> 38:47.448
and blabbin' suspects' names
to vengeful fathers.

38:47.525 --> 38:50.585
Cutting into heads before their times.
Getting poisoned.

38:50.661 --> 38:53.562
Gettin' blown up because you go
grabbing for things you shouldn't ought.

38:53.631 --> 38:56.691
Taking photographs from frames.

38:56.767 --> 39:01.261
Gettin' a perfectly good car
smashed to bits for no good reason.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.866
Get it together.
Start using your oversized heads.

39:04.942 --> 39:06.933
<i>This is the real world.</i>

39:07.011 --> 39:12.711
Now, I know bug man here
handed in his resignation.

39:12.783 --> 39:16.879
My officialJustice Department
recommendation is the following.

39:16.954 --> 39:19.445
We win the case,
he gets his job back.

39:19.523 --> 39:22.117
We lose, Booth shoots him.

39:23.160 --> 39:25.560
The jury's returned
with the verdict.

39:25.629 --> 39:27.893
Okay, let's go face the music.

39:45.750 --> 39:48.844
Will the defendant please rise?

39:50.321 --> 39:53.449
<i>Madam Foreperson,</i>
<i>please read the verdict.</i>

39:53.524 --> 39:57.290
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>We thejury find the defendant guilty.</i>

39:57.361 --> 39:58.919
Told you so.

39:58.996 --> 40:01.294
- <i>[Judge] This court is adjourned.</i>
- <i># [Pop Ballad]</i>

40:01.365 --> 40:03.458
- Nicely done, Caroline.
- Thank you.

40:14.512 --> 40:17.276
[Mouthing Words]

40:17.348 --> 40:22.718
- [No Audible Dialogue]
- <i># [Continues]</i>

40:38.803 --> 40:42.671
<i># [Continues]</i>

40:42.740 --> 40:45.231
[No Audible Dialogue]

41:03.727 --> 41:06.218
<i># [Continues]</i>

41:25.249 --> 41:27.114
<i># [Ends]</i>

41:33.324 --> 41:35.485
<i>You look happy.</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>

41:35.559 --> 41:38.289
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, you look really happy.

41:38.362 --> 41:40.887
[Laughs]
You made the first move.

41:40.965 --> 41:43.160
- Well, you told me I should.
- How was it?

41:43.234 --> 41:45.168
I mean, I don't mean "it."

41:45.236 --> 41:47.864
No, no. I do. I mean... <i>it.</i>

41:47.938 --> 41:52.637
I discovered something very interesting
about cops and nicknames.

41:52.710 --> 41:56.441
- Anthropologically interesting?
- Anatomically interesting.

41:56.514 --> 42:00.473
They call the bald guy Curly,
and the fat guy Tiny.

42:00.551 --> 42:03.486
- It's ironic.
- So when they call Sully Peanut...

42:03.554 --> 42:05.545
He doesn't like to shower
with the other guys...

42:05.623 --> 42:08.592
because he diverges from
the quantifiable morphological norm.

42:08.659 --> 42:12.561
- What? What's that mean?
- Stands out from a crowd.

42:12.630 --> 42:15.292
Do you have a nickname, Booth?
Something the other cops call you?

42:15.366 --> 42:17.596
Why? What have you heard?

42:19.036 --> 42:22.403
- Congrats, Brennan.
- [Chuckling] Wow.

42:22.473 --> 42:25.340
<i>Those socks... Those are amazing.</i>

42:25.409 --> 42:27.934
Right. The socks,
the tie, the belt buckle.

42:28.012 --> 42:31.072
All escape valves
for my socioeconomic rage.

42:31.148 --> 42:33.082
I hate psychology.

42:33.150 --> 42:35.778
Oh, you know, they help me
deal with the day-to-day irritations...

42:35.853 --> 42:38.151
of dealing with people
that are more privileged.

42:38.222 --> 42:41.123
I slept with Sully last night.

42:42.860 --> 42:46.159
- Oh. I thought you already...
- No. Last night.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.494
Oh. It's really none of my business.

42:48.566 --> 42:51.501
- Except we're partners.
- Yeah, there's that.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.197
And you told me about your socks.

42:54.271 --> 42:56.796
Mm-hmm. Sex, socks...
Pretty much the same word.

42:56.874 --> 42:59.434
Do we have a case,
or are you just visiting?

42:59.510 --> 43:01.944
Yeah. I'll fill you in
on the way. It's messy.

43:02.012 --> 43:04.003
Better get some protection.

43:04.081 --> 43:06.174
Let me get my gum boots.

43:10.654 --> 43:12.588
[Exhales]

43:12.656 --> 43:14.988
Yeah. I'm gonna need a flashier tie.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.559
What's that mean?

43:52.305 --> 43:58.414
