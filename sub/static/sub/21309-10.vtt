00:01.002 --> 00:04.605
- Previously on The Strain...
- Zack?

00:04.639 --> 00:07.108
- He wanted me to find out
where the nuclear bomb is.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.243
- Zack's working
with the Master.

00:09.277 --> 00:11.245
I took him up to the roof.
He cut his thumb open.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.247
- It's like setting off
a flare.

00:13.281 --> 00:16.751
- Will you just have the decency to
look at me and tell me the truth?

00:16.785 --> 00:19.320
- The Master said I get
to decide what to do with you.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.589
So tell me where the nuke is,
and I'll let you live.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.658
- Good-bye, Zack.
- Where are you going?

00:23.692 --> 00:25.760
- You made your choice.
Live with it.

00:25.794 --> 00:27.929
- Dad, I'm trying
to save your life.

00:27.962 --> 00:29.998
- The Master's sending
his troops. We have to go.

00:30.031 --> 00:32.266
- What's our target?
- Empire State Building.

00:32.300 --> 00:35.003
- If Zack has told us something, it's
because the Master wanted him to.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.806
- He's probably set a trap for us there.
- If the Master

00:37.839 --> 00:40.975
wants to draw us into a trap,
then into his trap I shall go.

00:41.009 --> 00:43.177
I'll contact you via radio.
You'll then drive

00:43.211 --> 00:46.514
the bomb to the base of the building and
escape before I trigger the weapon.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.516
- (Master's voice):
You think I'm foolish enough

00:48.549 --> 00:50.518
to come within range
of your bomb?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.821
- I shall never give up
my pursuit of you.

00:52.854 --> 00:56.991
- You'll have your confrontation. It'll
be at a time and place of my choosing.

00:57.025 --> 00:59.027
- He didn't take the bait.
Leave at once.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.529
- What?
(growling)

01:04.398 --> 01:07.068
- We got trouble.
(snarling)

01:11.339 --> 01:13.708
- Oh, shit.

01:13.742 --> 01:16.044
- We got to think
about the weapon.

01:16.077 --> 01:19.380
- Yeah. Not the time
to make a final stand.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.216
- I got this. They get
their hands on the nuke;

01:22.250 --> 01:24.719
it's game over. You guys
get in the van and take off.

01:24.753 --> 01:26.721
I'll see you back
at the rendezvous.

01:26.755 --> 01:28.890
Go!

01:31.459 --> 01:33.427
- No nice way to say this, Gus,

01:33.461 --> 01:35.396
but don't get stung
and lead the Master back to us.

01:35.429 --> 01:39.500

- Where they coming from, man?

01:55.950 --> 01:57.952

02:06.060 --> 02:07.728
Keep shooting!

02:12.300 --> 02:14.568
- I failed.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.971

Anything you have to say, say it

Only for himself.

05:16.985 --> 05:20.154
Come. Follow me.

We must find
the nuclear weapon.

Why didn't you say something?

06:47.708 --> 06:49.543

06:49.577 --> 06:52.380

and I'm just
standing in the dark

06:54.415 --> 06:56.250

Nothing but a few stragglers
left to antagonize me.

07:04.692 --> 07:07.061

- We got antagonized ourselves.

07:07.095 --> 07:09.897
We left Gus and his gang
back there to fend them off.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.899
We hightailed it over here
with the bomb, though.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.568
- I don't see how we're gonna
get anywhere near him.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.938
We don't even know if he's still
in the city. - He's still here.

Follow me.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.400
- So where are we going?

07:46.434 --> 07:49.036
- This elevator
is the subsurface entrance

07:49.069 --> 07:51.272
to New York City
Water Tunnel Number 3.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.741
- Just when I thought
I was never gonna get

07:53.774 --> 07:56.110
another New York
history lesson.

07:56.144 --> 07:58.212
- This was gonna be
the main tunnel

07:58.246 --> 08:00.981
bringing water
to all of New York City

08:01.014 --> 08:03.284
from reservoirs
over 60 miles away.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.753
It was built
to replace

08:05.786 --> 08:08.222
two older tunnels.
The dig for this project

08:08.256 --> 08:09.790
started in 1970

08:09.823 --> 08:12.260
and was slated
to finish in 2020--

08:12.293 --> 08:15.896
a 50-year construction project.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.632
They were almost there, too.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.169

Some hole, huh?

08:34.848 --> 08:37.285
Built by Sandhogs,

08:37.318 --> 08:39.787
a family trade handed down
through generations,

08:39.820 --> 08:41.789
and fathers and sons

08:41.822 --> 08:43.924
working side by side.

08:43.957 --> 08:47.161
Lifelong jobs to bring
the city their water.

08:47.195 --> 08:50.964
People built this.

08:50.998 --> 08:54.668

a pretty good story.

08:54.702 --> 08:58.005

for us to store our nuke

08:58.038 --> 09:00.040

what to do next.

Tell me, uh, what did you have in mind?

- WOMAN (on TV): Well, Carol

09:13.521 --> 09:16.457

- Why don't those assholes

09:16.490 --> 09:18.025

we just take off, man?

09:22.663 --> 09:25.466
- No, we can't leave the van.
We need the silver.

09:25.499 --> 09:28.802
- Fine. I guess
we just watch Bob Newhart.

Can you imagine?

We'd be kings.
