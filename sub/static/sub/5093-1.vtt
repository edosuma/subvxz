WEBVTT

00:05.042 --> 00:06.792
Look at that move!
Look at that move!

00:10.897 --> 00:12.080
Take him, Jack.

00:12.082 --> 00:13.331
Ten seconds, Jack!

00:15.001 --> 00:16.218
Go!

00:23.427 --> 00:25.343
Yeah! Yeah!
Okay.

00:26.764 --> 00:28.930
All right, Jack!

Dad! Dad!

00:38.525 --> 00:39.908
Dad, did you see?

00:39.910 --> 00:41.476
Did you see?
Danny. Danny.

00:41.478 --> 00:43.078
Hey, hey! Yes!
That was great.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.362
You juked that guy so much,

00:44.364 --> 00:45.964
I think you left
his jockstrap in Astoria.

00:45.966 --> 00:47.632
I faked him left,
then took him right.

00:47.634 --> 00:49.167
You did just the way
we practiced, right?

00:49.169 --> 00:50.869
Good job.
Thanks for letting me borrow this.

00:50.871 --> 00:51.953
No, that's yours.
Really?

00:51.955 --> 00:53.238
Yeah, you keep it.
Oh, thanks.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.290
Okay, come on.
You shoot, you score, you win.

00:55.292 --> 00:56.875
Now let's go get
some ice cream.

00:56.877 --> 00:58.159
Ice cream!
Ice cream!

00:58.161 --> 00:59.611
Let's go.
Ice cream.

00:59.613 --> 01:01.713
Ice cream. Ice cream.
Ice cream!

01:03.850 --> 01:05.667
So, what was that back there?

01:05.669 --> 01:06.968
It was nothing.

01:06.970 --> 01:09.821
Really? 'Cause it didn't
look like nothing.

01:09.823 --> 01:11.406
We'll talk about it
tonight, okay?

01:11.408 --> 01:12.524
Yes, please.

01:12.526 --> 01:14.810
We will.
Okay.

01:18.180 --> 01:19.781
That rabbit's foot
looked familiar.

01:19.783 --> 01:22.367
Yeah, think you gave it to me
around the same age.

01:22.369 --> 01:24.402
Pretty sure I hit
a home run that day, too.

01:24.404 --> 01:26.204
I have a vague
recollection of that.

01:26.206 --> 01:27.405
Everything okay?

01:27.407 --> 01:29.074
Yeah.

01:29.076 --> 01:31.827
Grandpa's treating
everybody to ice cream.

01:31.829 --> 01:34.246
That's why we invite him.

01:50.596 --> 01:51.546
Hey, Reagan.

01:51.548 --> 01:52.881
Reagan.
Hi, Sarge.

01:52.883 --> 01:54.883
Just the man I'm looking for.
Come on, walk with me.

01:54.885 --> 01:56.768
Hey, if this is about me
getting a new partner,

01:56.770 --> 01:58.069
you can stop apologizing.

01:58.071 --> 01:59.321
I get it. It's time.

01:59.323 --> 02:01.072
As a matter of fact,
it is about your new partner.

02:01.074 --> 02:02.223
I wanted to
introduce you to him.

02:02.225 --> 02:03.358
Renzulli.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.526
I got to take care
of this.

02:04.528 --> 02:07.195
I'll... I'll get back to you.
Yeah.

02:08.281 --> 02:09.497
Yeah, boss.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.500
Get out of here.
I told them straight up,

02:11.502 --> 02:13.401
"Your collar, your puddle."
You know what I'm saying?

02:13.403 --> 02:15.253
It's a new slogan
of mine, I swear.

02:15.255 --> 02:16.671
That's a great story, man.

02:16.673 --> 02:18.290
Best part of
the story is,

02:18.292 --> 02:20.008
I returned the phone

02:20.010 --> 02:21.510
to the blonde.

02:21.512 --> 02:24.379
And when I did,
she thanked me...

02:24.381 --> 02:25.764
all night long.

02:25.766 --> 02:27.682
I kid you not.

02:27.684 --> 02:29.434
It had to be done.

02:29.436 --> 02:30.969
You know what I mean?

02:30.971 --> 02:32.571
Oh, that's so wrong.
Hey.

02:32.573 --> 02:34.189
Hey, we didn't meet.
I'm Vinny Cruz.

02:34.191 --> 02:35.307
Hey. Jamie Reagan.

02:35.309 --> 02:36.424
That was some story.

02:36.426 --> 02:38.360
Oh, yeah.
The, uh, 3-5 was a madhouse.

02:38.362 --> 02:40.946
You know, real busy,
but a lot of laughs.

02:40.948 --> 02:42.230
So you're down here now?

02:42.232 --> 02:44.699
I am-- transferred
to the Midtown Country Club,

02:44.701 --> 02:45.951
effective today.

02:45.953 --> 02:48.203
Well, we may not be
as busy as the 3-5, but, uh,

02:48.205 --> 02:49.955
we see our share
of the action, too, right, guys?

02:49.957 --> 02:51.540
I know.
I'm just busting chops, man.

02:51.542 --> 02:53.325
But it was real good
to meet you.

02:53.327 --> 02:54.326
Yeah, you, too. Welcome.

02:54.328 --> 02:55.443
All right.
Okay, good.

02:55.445 --> 02:56.444
You two guys met?

02:56.446 --> 02:57.796
Yeah.
Yeah. We did.

02:57.798 --> 02:59.464
All right, well,
let's make it official.

02:59.466 --> 03:00.966
By the power vested in me,

03:00.968 --> 03:03.552
I pronounce
the two of you partners.

03:03.554 --> 03:05.921
So...

03:05.923 --> 03:08.390
Thanks, Sarge.

03:15.147 --> 03:17.182
How's our little David Beckham?

03:17.184 --> 03:18.350
Uh, he's looking at getting

03:18.352 --> 03:20.018
an endorsement deal
for his jersey now.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.736
Oh, brother.

03:21.738 --> 03:23.438
What's next, a
contract extension?

03:23.440 --> 03:24.823
Oh, you wish.

03:24.825 --> 03:27.325
He's, uh, asking questions
about Victoria Beckham.

03:28.645 --> 03:30.445
Over my dead body.

03:30.447 --> 03:31.997
It was a joke, Mom.

03:33.950 --> 03:35.333
What are you up to?

03:35.335 --> 03:38.319
I'm saying yes to St. Victor's.

03:39.205 --> 03:41.539
Jumping right back
into the rat race, huh?

03:42.960 --> 03:45.677
Danny.

03:45.679 --> 03:47.929
It's just a couple of
shifts at the hospital.

03:47.931 --> 03:49.764
It's not like I'm
going to be working

03:49.766 --> 03:51.683
the arbitrage
desk at Goldman.

03:51.685 --> 03:54.519
I know, I know.

03:56.188 --> 04:00.842
Maybe you want to try out
your nurse's outfit right now?

04:00.844 --> 04:05.063
Watch a movie or...
whatever.

04:05.948 --> 04:07.348
Sounds good.

04:07.350 --> 04:08.817
Yeah?
Yeah.

04:08.819 --> 04:10.785
As soon as you tell
me what had you

04:10.787 --> 04:12.787
jumping out of your
boots at the game today.

04:14.741 --> 04:16.541
That was nothing.

04:16.543 --> 04:19.661
Come on, you know I don't like
to bring the job home.

04:19.663 --> 04:21.079
It's fine.

04:21.081 --> 04:22.914
So, everything's okay?

04:22.916 --> 04:25.166
Right as rain.

04:25.168 --> 04:26.701
- Hey, Sarge.
- Hey, guys.

04:26.703 --> 04:27.919
What do we got?

04:27.921 --> 04:29.203
Charles Zappa.

04:29.205 --> 04:32.057
Says a male black, early 20s,
wearing a white T-shirt,

04:32.059 --> 04:33.892
put a gun on him
and swiped his bag

04:33.894 --> 04:35.310
coming off the
number six train.

04:35.312 --> 04:36.478
Mr. Zappa.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.762
You, uh... you look
pretty winded.

04:37.764 --> 04:40.098
You chased a guy with a gun
all the way here?

04:40.100 --> 04:41.232
Yeah.

04:41.234 --> 04:43.217
Listen, my wallet and my laptop
are in that bag.

04:43.219 --> 04:44.402
My whole life's in that thing.

04:44.404 --> 04:46.321
He lost him when the perp
buzzed into this building.

04:46.323 --> 04:48.023
We gonna go knock
on some doors?

04:48.025 --> 04:49.941
Yeah. You, me and Reagan.

04:49.943 --> 04:51.409
Blake, I want you
in the alley

04:51.411 --> 04:53.061
around the back
in case this mutt squirts.

04:53.063 --> 04:54.162
Ten-four, Sarge.
Now, you--

04:54.164 --> 04:55.563
wait by the car,
okay, Mr. Zappa?

04:55.565 --> 04:56.915
Yes, sir.
All right, boys.

05:09.679 --> 05:11.513
Who's there?

05:11.515 --> 05:14.432
Come on. Who's there?

05:49.385 --> 05:50.835
Heads up around back.

05:50.837 --> 05:52.921
Heavy movement
on the second floor.

05:52.923 --> 05:54.806
Rear apartment.
We're moving in on it.

05:54.808 --> 05:56.891
Copy that.

06:08.470 --> 06:10.155
Police. Open up.

06:11.306 --> 06:13.024
Sarge, there he goes!

06:13.026 --> 06:14.359
He's on the move!

06:24.620 --> 06:26.254
Don't move! Don't move.

06:26.256 --> 06:28.423
We got him!
Cuff him.

06:28.425 --> 06:30.125
We got him.

06:31.627 --> 06:33.161
Got a gun.

06:33.163 --> 06:35.680
Oh, let me guess--
that ain't yours, huh?

06:37.134 --> 06:38.516
Stay with him.

06:38.518 --> 06:40.468
Put shots fired over the air.

06:40.470 --> 06:42.887
Attention, 10-13--
shots fired.

06:42.889 --> 06:45.223
What happened?

06:45.225 --> 06:47.609
I don't know. He just...
he just came out of nowhere.

06:47.611 --> 06:50.111
Who is he?
I don't know!

06:50.113 --> 06:52.197
12 George to Central--
we need a bus at the rear

06:52.199 --> 06:53.481
of our location forthwith.
All right, buddy.

06:53.483 --> 06:54.866
We got it.
We got it from here.

06:54.868 --> 06:56.117
I shot him.
What did I do?

06:56.119 --> 06:58.236
He's going to make it.
Is he going to make it?

06:58.238 --> 06:59.571
You're going to be
all right, okay?

06:59.573 --> 07:00.538
Just stay with me, okay?

07:00.540 --> 07:01.689
Oh, my God.

07:01.691 --> 07:03.408
Help's on the way.
Oh, my God.

07:03.410 --> 07:06.027
I didn't want to alarm you.

07:06.029 --> 07:08.413
This is probably nothing.

07:08.415 --> 07:09.831
Sorry, Danny.
It's not nothing

07:09.833 --> 07:11.883
when you almost shoot
the Minafos' cat.

07:11.885 --> 07:13.718
I got a video text message

07:13.720 --> 07:16.104
from a guy that I collared
years ago.

07:16.106 --> 07:17.972
Well, what'd it say?

07:18.808 --> 07:21.009
Take a look.

07:22.428 --> 07:24.512
Hey, Danny.

07:24.514 --> 07:26.431
It's me.

07:28.051 --> 07:30.384
Been a while.

07:30.386 --> 07:34.272
Eight years, four months
and three days,

07:34.274 --> 07:36.608
to be exact.

07:36.610 --> 07:38.860
Hope you've been thinking of me,

07:38.862 --> 07:42.330
'cause I've been thinking
a lot about you.

07:43.732 --> 07:45.450
Anyway...

07:45.452 --> 07:47.919
I just got out.

07:47.921 --> 07:53.124
And I'm looking forward
to seeing you very soon.

07:53.126 --> 07:54.575
Bye.

07:54.577 --> 07:57.011
Jesus, Danny.

07:58.464 --> 08:01.015
Who is that?

08:03.936 --> 08:06.437
Wait a minute.

08:06.439 --> 08:09.023
Is that Benjamin Walker?

08:13.095 --> 08:15.480
You always swore that everyone
you collared swears revenge,

08:15.482 --> 08:18.533
but none of them have the balls
to do it except for...

08:18.535 --> 08:21.119
Except for Benjamin Walker.

08:22.755 --> 08:24.489
And now he's out
and he's threatening you.

08:24.491 --> 08:26.040
Isn't that against the law?

08:27.126 --> 08:30.245
In the eyes of the law,
he did nothing; he said hello.

08:30.247 --> 08:31.246
And in your eyes?

08:31.248 --> 08:33.414
In my eyes...

08:33.416 --> 08:36.333
whoever said time
heals all wounds

08:36.336 --> 08:38.303
probably never did prison time.

08:38.304 --> 08:40.972
You think he's coming after you,
and you're scared, Danny.

08:40.974 --> 08:42.140
Oh, no, whoa.

08:42.142 --> 08:43.808
I... I didn't say all of that.

08:43.809 --> 08:46.978
Danny, listen to me
for a second, okay?

08:46.980 --> 08:50.464
We've been married for 15 years,
and you've been

08:50.466 --> 08:52.984
wearing the shield
for every single one of them.

08:52.986 --> 08:54.519
Now, I don't know
if you noticed,

08:54.521 --> 08:56.654
but that doesn't mean
I get to kick back

08:56.656 --> 08:57.939
and have my nails done

08:57.941 --> 09:00.141
while you bust through walls
taking down bad guys.

09:00.143 --> 09:03.244
That means the both of us have
about two decades on the job.

09:03.246 --> 09:05.146
I know.

09:05.148 --> 09:07.198
I'm stronger
than you think, Danny.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.200
Just tell me
what we're up against.

09:10.669 --> 09:13.705
I'm not scared.

09:15.374 --> 09:17.091
Just concerned.

09:20.546 --> 09:22.964
Very concerned.

So the doctor says I should get
it lanced, but you know me--

09:52.706 --> 09:55.190
I pass out taking
off a Band-Aid.

09:55.192 --> 09:56.491
They're here already?

09:56.493 --> 09:57.693
Yes, sir.

09:57.695 --> 09:59.745
And we've just been notified
the man he shot,

09:59.747 --> 10:01.914
James Greer,
expired at 845 hours.

10:01.916 --> 10:04.416
I need to
sit in on this.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.420
Thank you, Baker.

10:10.006 --> 10:11.456
Ten-hut.
As you were.

10:11.458 --> 10:12.824
Please.

10:22.385 --> 10:24.887
Commissioner.

10:24.889 --> 10:26.572
Captain Mancuso.

10:26.574 --> 10:28.774
I explained to my
officer that he's under

10:28.776 --> 10:30.425
no legal or
departmental obligation

10:30.427 --> 10:32.861
to discuss any of the
details of this shooting.

10:32.863 --> 10:35.781
And frankly sir, I told him
he shouldn't have come.

10:35.783 --> 10:37.115
And that he'd
be well-advised

10:37.117 --> 10:38.929
to have a lawyer
or union representative present?

10:38.954 --> 10:40.153
Yes.

10:40.154 --> 10:43.038
Commissioner, I know
that this isn't protocol,

10:43.040 --> 10:45.240
but I need to tell you
personally what happened.

10:46.410 --> 10:48.827
I was in the alley
when I heard Sergeant Renzulli

10:48.829 --> 10:50.462
transmit that the perp
was running.

10:50.464 --> 10:52.697
Seconds later,
somebody kicked open

10:52.699 --> 10:56.585
a door behind me, and
I turned around fast.

10:56.587 --> 11:00.138
I panicked, and I fired.

11:00.140 --> 11:02.140
This was my fault.

11:04.560 --> 11:08.313
Officer Blake...
until the Shooting Team conducts

11:08.315 --> 11:13.402
a thorough investigation, we
really don't know what happened.

11:13.404 --> 11:16.571
So why don't you let them
do their job

11:16.573 --> 11:18.223
and you need to find a lawyer.

11:18.225 --> 11:20.575
I shot an innocent man,
and the last thing I had...

11:20.577 --> 11:24.112
That is why these protocols are
in place...

11:24.114 --> 11:25.664
to protect you.

11:26.799 --> 11:30.168
I realize the position that I've
put you in here, sir.

11:30.170 --> 11:33.789
Well, I've got
pretty broad shoulders.

11:33.791 --> 11:35.907
Why don't you let me worry
about that?

11:35.909 --> 11:39.044
If I may, sir?

11:39.046 --> 11:42.514
You gave the speech
at my high school graduation.

11:42.516 --> 11:46.101
You said, "All it takes for evil
to triumph...

11:46.103 --> 11:48.086
...is for good men
to do nothing."

11:48.088 --> 11:51.523
I was quoting someone--
Edmund Burke.

11:51.525 --> 11:53.392
But I'm glad you heard it.

11:53.394 --> 11:56.261
You're the reason I became
a cop, Commissioner.

11:57.730 --> 12:00.649
I see.

12:01.934 --> 12:04.319
Then please,
take my advice, okay?

12:05.538 --> 12:07.072
Let's go.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.074
Thanks for your time, sir.
Sure.

12:11.661 --> 12:13.829
Please tell the victim
how sorry I am.

12:17.383 --> 12:19.167
The death's gonna hit him hard.

12:19.169 --> 12:20.618
Yeah.

12:20.620 --> 12:23.805
Situations like these
don't build character,

12:23.807 --> 12:24.956
they reveal it.

12:24.958 --> 12:27.642
Pretty damn impressive, considering.
Yeah.

12:30.730 --> 12:33.231
Jim, we're going out.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.386
I don't get it, Reagan.

12:37.388 --> 12:40.472
I've seen you lock up hundreds
of hard guys

12:40.474 --> 12:41.907
that threatened payback.

12:41.909 --> 12:44.226
Why does this guy have
you so spooked?

12:44.228 --> 12:45.594
Love.

12:45.596 --> 12:46.811
What?

12:46.813 --> 12:49.364
When I met Benjamin Walker,
he had nothing, Jack.

12:49.366 --> 12:51.733
He was a angry and violent
demolitions expert

12:51.735 --> 12:54.069
who loved to blow stuff up,
mostly bank vaults.

12:54.071 --> 12:56.171
And then he fell in
love with Maria DiSalvo.

12:56.173 --> 12:58.457
Is that whose house
we're gonna knock on?

12:58.459 --> 13:01.176
Yeah. Her love was like
a life raft for him.

13:01.178 --> 13:03.011
Somehow, it turned
his whole life around.

13:03.013 --> 13:06.014
And as a reward for good
behavior, she got pregnant.

13:06.016 --> 13:08.050
Thing is, she wanted
him to turn around

13:08.052 --> 13:09.468
and give up the life.

13:09.470 --> 13:11.503
He promised he would,
but he didn't tell her

13:11.505 --> 13:13.755
he had one more score left in him.
Uh-huh.

13:13.757 --> 13:15.323
So, he wanted to do
something big,

13:15.325 --> 13:17.976
something to pay her back
for all the good she'd done

13:17.978 --> 13:19.661
and set them up for life.

13:19.663 --> 13:21.229
So he did
his one last score.

13:21.231 --> 13:22.531
That's when you busted him.
Yeah.

13:22.533 --> 13:27.536
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Maria DiSalvo.

13:27.538 --> 13:29.821
Oh, man, she hasn't lived here
in years.

13:29.823 --> 13:31.323
Yeah, I know that.

13:31.325 --> 13:32.574
Just wondering
did anyone come around

13:32.576 --> 13:33.992
asking for her,
looking for her?

13:33.994 --> 13:34.793
Other than you?

13:34.795 --> 13:36.411
Yeah, other than me.

13:36.413 --> 13:37.879
No.

13:37.881 --> 13:40.248
Listen, if you see
or hear anything,

13:40.250 --> 13:41.917
can you give us a call?

13:43.886 --> 13:47.539
Yeah, see, after after
I collared Benjamin walker,

13:47.541 --> 13:49.641
she took off, never
to be heard from again.

13:49.643 --> 13:52.060
So he never got
to see his kid?

13:52.062 --> 13:53.711
No. I'm guessing
he's blaming me.

13:53.713 --> 13:55.847
The thing is with kids,
you know, in a instant

13:55.849 --> 13:57.215
they could change
your whole world.

13:57.217 --> 13:59.050
So here's Benjamin Walker
thinking he's about to have

13:59.052 --> 14:00.986
his whole world in
the palm of his hands,

14:00.988 --> 14:03.555
and I come along and take it
all away from him.

14:41.093 --> 14:44.279
Mrs. Greer... I'm Frank Reagan.

14:44.281 --> 14:47.199
I know who you are,
Commissioner.

14:51.404 --> 14:54.772
I didn't come here
as a Police Commissioner.

14:54.774 --> 14:56.341
I came here as a father.

14:56.343 --> 14:58.510
He was minding his own business.

14:58.512 --> 15:02.130
Stepped for a cigarette and
got his life stolen from him.

15:02.132 --> 15:05.800
You have every right
to feel the way you do...

15:05.802 --> 15:07.669
toward me and
the police department.

15:07.671 --> 15:09.888
Thank you for your permission.

15:09.890 --> 15:12.257
Is this where I'm supposed
to cry on your shoulder?

15:12.259 --> 15:13.925
Mom...

15:13.927 --> 15:16.961
It's all right.

15:16.963 --> 15:21.066
I wish I could tell you
it gets easier. It doesn't.

15:21.068 --> 15:23.735
And it will never make sense.

15:23.737 --> 15:25.687
And how would you know that?

15:25.689 --> 15:26.971
I lost a son.

15:26.973 --> 15:31.526
Was he shot down in cold blood
by your NYPD?

15:35.448 --> 15:37.199
Matter of fact, he was.

15:39.418 --> 15:42.170
I'm sorry, Commissioner.

15:45.424 --> 15:48.326
Clearly, I'm not helping here.

15:48.328 --> 15:50.629
I will leave you to your family,
Mrs. Greer.

15:50.631 --> 15:53.515
I didn't mean
to disturb you...

15:54.767 --> 15:57.435
...and I'm sorry for your loss.

16:03.526 --> 16:06.111
Come on. There's nothing else
you could tell me?

16:06.113 --> 16:07.612
There's nothing in his CJA file?

16:07.614 --> 16:12.183
He maxed out his sentence,
so no parole, no parole officer.

16:12.185 --> 16:14.452
He's not even required to leave
a forwarding address.

16:14.454 --> 16:16.321
All right. Thank you.

16:16.323 --> 16:20.158
Danny, I don't like the sound
of your voice.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.410
Oh, my baby sis
really does love me, huh?

16:22.412 --> 16:23.995
I do, and I'm not joking.

16:23.997 --> 16:25.830
I'm worried about you.

16:25.832 --> 16:28.133
Yeah, I know you are,
and I appreciate it,

16:28.135 --> 16:30.001
but don't worry, everything's
gonna be fine, okay?

16:30.003 --> 16:31.803
He's just, he's just messing
with my head.

16:31.805 --> 16:33.505
Trying to get under
my skin is all.

16:33.507 --> 16:36.258
Okay. Just be careful
out there, anyway.

16:36.260 --> 16:37.475
I will. Always.

16:37.477 --> 16:39.894
All right, look,
you got to let me go.

16:39.896 --> 16:42.430
I think my partner got lost
going to to get us coffee.

16:42.432 --> 16:44.649
Okay, bye.

16:47.236 --> 16:50.238
What'd you do, partner, you walk
to Coney Island for the coffee?

16:50.240 --> 16:52.557
Danny...
What's the matter, J?

16:53.726 --> 16:55.744
What makes you think
something's wrong?

16:58.914 --> 17:00.031
Benjamin Walker.

17:00.033 --> 17:02.617
That's me.

17:02.619 --> 17:04.953
How sweet, you remember me.

17:12.733 --> 17:13.684
Yeah, I remember you, Benjamin.

17:13.685 --> 17:15.819
It's been a long time.
I wondered.

17:15.821 --> 17:20.223
Lookit, you don't want her,
okay? You want me.

17:21.393 --> 17:24.779
And they say
that chivalry is dead.

17:24.781 --> 17:26.614
Listen, this is
not about her, okay?

17:26.616 --> 17:28.783
It's got nothing to do with her.
It's between us.

17:28.785 --> 17:30.751
You know,
she's very, very pretty.

17:30.753 --> 17:36.424
She even kind of
reminds me of Maria.

17:36.426 --> 17:40.661
Very soft lips and...

17:40.663 --> 17:41.929
pretty eyes.

17:41.931 --> 17:43.080
Come on, come on.

17:43.082 --> 17:44.882
What do you say we do
a swap here, all right?

17:44.884 --> 17:47.251
Let's meet up, we'll make
a swap, me for her, all right?

17:47.253 --> 17:50.104
It's a great idea.
In fact, well, you read my mind.

17:50.106 --> 17:52.306
Okay, you say where,
I'll be there.

17:52.308 --> 17:54.692
At our favorite park...

17:54.694 --> 17:57.228
where you arrested me.

17:57.230 --> 17:59.447
Oh, yeah, Danny,

17:59.449 --> 18:02.400
come alone, all right?

18:02.402 --> 18:04.535
By yourself.

18:04.537 --> 18:07.655
Because, um,
it's a private party.

18:07.657 --> 18:09.740
All right.

18:09.742 --> 18:11.775
All right, I'll be there.

18:22.621 --> 18:24.255
It was stupid.

18:24.257 --> 18:26.424
I wish you could've
given me a heads up

18:26.426 --> 18:30.144
'cause I could've alerted
the press, got some nice footage

18:30.146 --> 18:31.929
of the victim's family staring
daggers at you.

18:31.931 --> 18:34.015
Big mistake.

18:34.017 --> 18:36.150
It was a mistake
I had to make, Garrett.

18:36.152 --> 18:38.970
I'm just saying, Frank...

18:42.941 --> 18:46.244
All right.

18:46.246 --> 18:48.079
Here's the preliminary report

18:48.081 --> 18:49.146
from the shooting team.

18:49.148 --> 18:50.698
They still need
a few days

18:50.700 --> 18:52.816
to dot the i's,
cross the t's,

18:52.818 --> 18:54.585
but the bad news is

18:54.587 --> 18:57.205
ballistics confirms
that the bullet came

18:57.207 --> 18:58.372
from Officer Blake's gun.

18:58.374 --> 18:59.974
Good news is

18:59.976 --> 19:02.677
they're ruling it
an "accidental discharge

19:02.679 --> 19:04.262
without malicious intent."

19:04.264 --> 19:07.265
Assemble the boys in
the press room.

19:07.267 --> 19:08.432
Why?

19:08.434 --> 19:09.634
So we can make a statement.

19:09.636 --> 19:12.103
That says you have no comment
at this time.

19:12.105 --> 19:14.505
Close. Only it'll sound more
like we were wrong

19:14.507 --> 19:15.690
and we are deeply sorry.

19:15.692 --> 19:18.442
Cue the president of the
policeman's union

19:18.444 --> 19:20.678
on every station
in town calling you disloyal.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.863
We killed this woman's son.

19:22.865 --> 19:25.032
Frank, every cop in town is
gonna hate you.

19:25.034 --> 19:26.684
But you'll still love me, right?

19:30.906 --> 19:32.856
Thanks for being okay
with this, babe.

19:32.858 --> 19:34.208
She's your partner.
Let's be honest,

19:34.210 --> 19:36.193
it's not like I could have
stopped you anyway.

19:36.195 --> 19:37.662
You got nothing
to worry about, okay?

19:37.664 --> 19:38.879
Our sharpshooters are the best.

19:38.881 --> 19:41.215
They could put one through
Lincoln's ear on a penny

19:41.217 --> 19:42.967
from a hundred yards away.

19:42.969 --> 19:43.968
See? That hardly
even sound dangerous.

19:43.970 --> 19:46.887
I got a good team.
I'll be fine.

19:48.223 --> 19:49.924
I'm not worried, Danny.
You're not?

19:49.926 --> 19:51.041
No.
Okay.

19:51.043 --> 19:53.144
Everyone knows
what a good cop you are.

19:54.146 --> 19:55.980
But I know that you're
an even better father

19:55.982 --> 19:58.432
and you always come home to your boys.
All right.

19:58.434 --> 20:00.067
Okay.

20:00.069 --> 20:02.737
What did I do
to deserve you, huh?

20:02.739 --> 20:04.555
You got lucky.

20:05.774 --> 20:07.825
Oh, Jack wanted me...

20:07.827 --> 20:10.828
He said you could
borrow it, so...

20:10.830 --> 20:12.580
I told him you'd
bring it back.

20:12.582 --> 20:14.398
I will.

20:26.378 --> 20:29.513
I'm moving into position,
but I got no sign of him.

20:37.922 --> 20:41.776
Okay, I think I got
a visual on her,

20:41.778 --> 20:43.311
but she's all alone.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.481
Okay, something's going on here.

20:47.483 --> 20:50.368
Hey, Jack?

20:50.370 --> 20:53.237
Jackie...

20:53.239 --> 20:56.273
Okay, nobody move.
She's holding onto a backpack.

20:59.494 --> 21:01.445
You okay, partner?

21:12.290 --> 21:14.725
It's a bomb.

21:14.727 --> 21:16.310
Okay, everybody stand down.

21:16.312 --> 21:19.263
She's handcuffed to a bomb
in the backpack.

21:19.265 --> 21:20.964
Stand down.

21:30.488 --> 21:34.147
A bomb, Benjamin? A bomb?!
What part of this arrangement

21:34.247 --> 21:36.230
involved you strapping
a bomb to my partner?

21:36.232 --> 21:37.565
You lied to me!

21:37.567 --> 21:39.550
Says the pot to the kettle.

21:39.552 --> 21:43.237
Now tell all your sharpshooters
and all your undercovers

21:43.239 --> 21:44.605
it's time to go home.

21:44.607 --> 21:48.943
Give 'em a great big hand
and send 'em home.

21:48.945 --> 21:50.561
Okay.

21:50.563 --> 21:52.530
Tick-tock.

21:52.532 --> 21:54.615
Tick... tock.
Okay.

21:54.617 --> 21:55.916
All right!

21:55.918 --> 21:58.169
All units clear the area.

21:58.171 --> 22:00.738
Clear the area forthwith!

22:00.740 --> 22:04.542
Move it! Okay.

22:04.544 --> 22:06.627
They're leaving.

22:06.629 --> 22:08.963
I want you to help me
disengage this bomb now.

22:08.965 --> 22:10.348
I have a better idea.

22:10.350 --> 22:13.601
Why doesn't she give it to you?

22:14.469 --> 22:15.803
Okay.

22:15.805 --> 22:18.356
Okay.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.727
Walk over...

22:22.729 --> 22:26.430
and uncuff her

22:26.432 --> 22:27.698
with your key.

22:27.700 --> 22:31.118
Then cuff yourself
to the bomb.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.486
Understand?

22:32.488 --> 22:34.121
Yeah, I understand.

22:34.123 --> 22:35.656
Okay.

22:35.658 --> 22:36.791
Throw away the key,

22:36.793 --> 22:39.960
and walk to the east
edge of the park.

22:39.962 --> 22:41.945
I'm in a yellow taxi.

22:43.165 --> 22:45.466
If anyone follows,

22:45.468 --> 22:46.884
we go boom.

22:46.886 --> 22:48.669
You got it?

22:48.671 --> 22:50.087
I got it.

22:57.145 --> 22:59.730
I'm gonna have to take that
off your hands now, partner.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.401
We're gonna make
a little trade, okay?

23:03.403 --> 23:06.821
Whoa, Danny, Danny.

23:06.823 --> 23:08.138
Danny...

23:08.140 --> 23:09.490
you don't have to do this.

23:09.492 --> 23:10.691
This is my fight, okay?

23:10.693 --> 23:12.576
It's not yours.
Danny...

23:12.578 --> 23:14.245
I'm gonna go real slow, now,

23:14.247 --> 23:16.747
and take these cuffs
off you, okay?

23:19.835 --> 23:21.168
I know.

23:21.170 --> 23:22.820
I know, Jack.

23:22.822 --> 23:24.321
I gotta do this.

23:31.296 --> 23:34.048
Go get the son of a bitch, okay?

23:34.050 --> 23:35.666
I will.

23:35.668 --> 23:37.518
I'm sorry.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.220
Hey, don't say sorry.

23:39.222 --> 23:40.721
Okay? Look at me.

23:40.723 --> 23:43.190
I'm gonna take it
away now, okay?

23:48.029 --> 23:50.164
Okay, Jack, get out of here.

23:52.718 --> 23:53.701
Go on.

23:53.703 --> 23:55.903
Go.

24:17.559 --> 24:19.593
Hey!

24:19.595 --> 24:22.062
Drop the radio...

24:22.064 --> 24:26.049
the gun, your cell phone.

24:28.737 --> 24:29.720
Gun.

24:29.722 --> 24:32.156
Nice and easy.

24:36.862 --> 24:38.162
Ankle gun!

24:39.615 --> 24:41.782
Don't forget that one.

24:41.784 --> 24:42.783
All right.

24:42.785 --> 24:44.919
Ankle gun. Yeah, yeah.

24:44.921 --> 24:46.253
Okay.

24:50.074 --> 24:52.242
Just getting
rid of my phone.

24:54.546 --> 24:56.714
Sorry.

24:57.933 --> 25:00.584
Sorry.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.770
Get in!

25:15.500 --> 25:18.636
Frank Reagan's premature
public apology today

25:18.638 --> 25:20.154
was a slap in the face to every

25:20.156 --> 25:22.990
NYPD officer who proudly
wears the uniform.

25:22.992 --> 25:24.625
And as president of this union,

25:24.627 --> 25:26.927
I'm hereby calling for
a vote of no confidence

25:26.929 --> 25:28.295
in our commissioner.

25:29.113 --> 25:31.332
Told you.
Congratulations.

25:31.334 --> 25:33.283
You predicted the actions
of the most predictable man

25:33.285 --> 25:34.552
on the face of the earth.

25:34.554 --> 25:36.637
It's a vote of
no confidence, Frank.

25:36.639 --> 25:37.922
A public rebuke

25:37.924 --> 25:39.857
from one of our own.
You want to guess what

25:39.859 --> 25:41.258
the lead story's
gonna be tonight?

25:41.260 --> 25:43.394
I'll give you a hint.
It rhymes with "Frank Reagan""

25:43.396 --> 25:46.180
It's hardly the first time
I've had to handle criticism.

25:46.182 --> 25:48.599
It is the first time
fellow cops will be doing it.

25:48.601 --> 25:49.800
We were wrong.

25:49.802 --> 25:50.985
And I said so.

25:50.987 --> 25:52.903
Commissioner...

25:58.376 --> 26:00.143
What's wrong?

26:00.145 --> 26:03.080
An ex-convict who Detective
Reagan sent to prison

26:03.082 --> 26:05.316
has taken him hostage
at gunpoint.

26:09.254 --> 26:10.204
Personal grudge?

26:10.206 --> 26:11.589
Yes. Sir.

26:12.424 --> 26:14.825
Who's running the operation?

26:14.827 --> 26:16.544
His C.O., Sergeant Gormley.

26:17.964 --> 26:19.179
He's a good man.

26:19.181 --> 26:20.381
Thank you, Baker.

26:34.345 --> 26:38.449
I was being sarcastic, Ira.

26:38.451 --> 26:39.783
Good-bye, Ira.

26:39.785 --> 26:40.784
Hi.

26:40.786 --> 26:42.653
Erin, hey, it's me.

26:42.655 --> 26:45.355
Um, I just need
your help for a sec.

26:45.357 --> 26:49.026
Danny, he sent me this
really weird text, and, um...

26:49.028 --> 26:50.327
now he's not answering me.

26:50.329 --> 26:52.630
Okay, okay.
What did it say?

26:52.632 --> 26:56.901
It says, uh, "1Z96."

26:56.903 --> 26:58.802
One Z nine six.

26:58.804 --> 27:00.871
That sounds like
a taxi medallion number.

27:00.873 --> 27:02.556
Why would he send that to me?

27:03.391 --> 27:04.758
I don't know.

27:04.760 --> 27:07.044
I'm calling Jackie,
I'll pass it along, okay?

27:14.235 --> 27:16.003
Where we going?

27:16.005 --> 27:17.404
Right here's where we're going!

27:20.625 --> 27:23.077
Who's Jenny Roberts?

27:24.863 --> 27:27.114
Also known as
Maria DiSalvo.

27:34.673 --> 27:36.290
Yeah.

27:36.292 --> 27:39.176
She changed her name
after you put me away,

27:39.178 --> 27:41.095
so I couldn't find her.

27:41.097 --> 27:44.247
But I had plenty of time
to figure it out,

27:44.249 --> 27:45.599
thanks to you.

27:48.770 --> 27:50.971
I found out where she was.

27:53.391 --> 27:55.643
And him, too.

27:57.278 --> 28:00.314
That's my son.

28:00.316 --> 28:02.483
Seven years old.

28:05.603 --> 28:08.656
Never even got to
meet his father.

28:11.292 --> 28:13.276
I'm sorry.

28:13.278 --> 28:14.628
Of course you're sorry!

28:14.630 --> 28:15.963
You got a gun on you!

28:15.965 --> 28:18.165
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

28:18.167 --> 28:21.585
about more than that,
I'm sorry about your loss.

28:25.507 --> 28:27.925
What happened to them, Benjamin?

28:29.678 --> 28:33.347
It was a... it was
a home invasion, all right?

28:34.984 --> 28:37.484
Couple of junkies...

28:37.486 --> 28:39.653
broke in the apartment.

28:41.323 --> 28:44.608
And... they turned
the whole place upside down.

28:47.996 --> 28:49.496
They killed them both.

28:49.498 --> 28:51.198
They killed them...

28:51.200 --> 28:52.366
They killed them both.

28:52.368 --> 28:54.918
It's not your fault, Benjamin.

28:54.920 --> 28:57.821
It's not your fault,
what's happened to them.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.757
It's not your fault what's
happening now, I know.

28:59.759 --> 29:01.925
I understand.

29:01.927 --> 29:03.711
But you haven't
done anything yet

29:03.713 --> 29:05.429
that you can't come back from,

29:05.431 --> 29:08.182
do you understand me?

29:08.184 --> 29:11.101
I can... you've suffered a lot.

29:11.103 --> 29:13.437
You don't have to
suffer anymore, just...

29:13.439 --> 29:15.723
let me help you, okay?

29:15.725 --> 29:18.225
Let me help you;
give me that gun.

29:18.227 --> 29:19.476
You just give me the gun,

29:19.478 --> 29:21.612
and we can...
we can walk away from this.

29:26.017 --> 29:28.285
I ain't gonna
give you the gun.

29:29.120 --> 29:32.623
I'll give you this.

29:32.625 --> 29:34.825
I'll give you this, Danny.

29:41.884 --> 29:43.500
Start digging.

29:43.502 --> 29:45.552
You put them there,

29:45.554 --> 29:47.004
now it's your turn.

29:47.006 --> 29:48.872
You can dig your own grave.

29:51.726 --> 29:53.477
Come on!

29:53.479 --> 29:55.879
I know this is your cab,
now tell me where it is.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.065
I got 50 cabs on the road
at the same time.

29:58.067 --> 30:00.017
How do I know where
any one cab is?

30:00.019 --> 30:02.436
Because it has GPS.
Now do it.

30:02.438 --> 30:04.104
I'll call the driver.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.239
Your driver's either dead,

30:05.241 --> 30:06.523
or locked up in
the back of the trunk.

30:06.525 --> 30:09.526
A police officer's life
is at stake, sir!

30:13.064 --> 30:14.564
I'm done talking.

30:14.566 --> 30:16.667
Sit down and tell me
where the cab is.

30:16.669 --> 30:18.786
Or God help me...
Okay!

30:18.788 --> 30:20.120
Okay. I'm doing it.

30:20.122 --> 30:22.339
I'm doing it.

30:28.579 --> 30:30.747
Commissioner...

30:38.056 --> 30:39.940
Danny.

30:39.942 --> 30:42.025
No, it's Officer Blake.

30:42.027 --> 30:44.928
He's locked himself in the house
with a gun to his head.

30:54.606 --> 30:56.039
Hey.
Hey, Sarge.

30:56.041 --> 30:58.792
Blake's wife.

30:58.794 --> 31:00.961
Poor thing must be
dying inside.

31:00.963 --> 31:02.663
I just wish I could
bust through the door

31:02.665 --> 31:04.298
and rip the gun out of
his hands, you know?

31:04.300 --> 31:06.133
Best thing we can
do is hang back.

31:06.135 --> 31:08.001
Send our thoughts
and prayers.

31:12.307 --> 31:14.508
Hey.
Hey.

31:17.762 --> 31:19.462
You can tell your buddies
they can stop whispering.

31:19.464 --> 31:21.098
It's not like I don't know
what they're saying.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.267
Oh, yeah?
What are they saying?

31:23.269 --> 31:26.236
That my father shouldn't have
apologized publically.

31:26.238 --> 31:28.471
And he didn't have to
admit we got it wrong.

31:28.473 --> 31:30.025
But we did get it wrong.

31:30.050 --> 31:31.697
And he had to shout it
from a mountaintop?

31:31.797 --> 31:33.346
You prefer he sweep it
under the rug?

31:33.348 --> 31:35.832
I'd rather he choose
us over them.

31:35.834 --> 31:37.050
Who's "them"?

31:37.052 --> 31:39.686
Anybody not wearing blue.

31:40.722 --> 31:42.505
Look, where I come from,

31:42.507 --> 31:44.558
all we got out here
is each other.

31:44.560 --> 31:47.527
And if a fellow cop
don't got your back,

31:47.529 --> 31:49.196
nobody does.

31:51.032 --> 31:53.200
Let's be straight.

31:53.202 --> 31:55.619
You're not high on me,
I'm not high on you.

31:55.621 --> 31:57.320
But get this much clear:

31:57.322 --> 31:59.706
there's no cop that has
ever backed his men

31:59.708 --> 32:02.192
more than my father.

32:02.194 --> 32:03.493
And if anybody says otherwise,

32:03.495 --> 32:05.212
they're gonna have to
answer to me.

32:15.506 --> 32:18.008
It's not too late,
you know.

32:18.010 --> 32:21.211
You don't want to make
a bad situation worse.

32:24.348 --> 32:26.266
Get up and keep on
digging, and shut up!

32:26.268 --> 32:27.818
I'm doing everything you ask.

32:29.237 --> 32:31.554
Drop your weapon, Benjamin!

32:38.112 --> 32:39.946
Nobody make a move!

32:40.898 --> 32:41.898
I'll kill him!

32:41.900 --> 32:44.284
Right here, right now!

32:44.286 --> 32:46.203
You hear me?

32:58.371 --> 32:59.839
Benjamin, drop it!

32:59.841 --> 33:01.207
No way.

33:01.209 --> 33:02.558
You drop yours!

33:02.560 --> 33:06.679
Or you can say good-bye
to Detective Danny.

33:06.681 --> 33:08.397
Just listen to them, all right?

33:08.399 --> 33:10.483
It's over, Benjamin.
Come on.

33:10.485 --> 33:11.984
It ain't over
till I say it's over.

33:11.986 --> 33:13.402
What are you going to do?

33:13.404 --> 33:14.854
You going to shoot me?

33:14.856 --> 33:16.105
They're going to shoot you.

33:16.107 --> 33:17.406
It doesn't make any sense.

33:17.408 --> 33:19.942
It's not going to bring
your girl and your kid back.

33:19.944 --> 33:22.862
Nobody's going to gun me
when I got you.

33:22.864 --> 33:25.397
You're my good luck charm.

33:25.399 --> 33:27.950
What are you going to do
against all of them, Benjamin?

33:27.952 --> 33:29.118
Huh? Look at them.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.286
Look at them.

33:30.288 --> 33:32.371
It's over.

33:33.207 --> 33:34.540
Look at them all.

33:34.542 --> 33:36.843
So come on,
just drop the gun.

33:36.845 --> 33:38.044
It's over.

33:38.046 --> 33:39.345
Just turn yourself in.

33:39.347 --> 33:40.496
Come on.

33:52.726 --> 33:55.361
Reagan!

34:18.368 --> 34:20.452
Lieutenant; Ed.

34:20.454 --> 34:22.088
Sir.

34:22.090 --> 34:23.222
All due respect sir,

34:23.224 --> 34:25.224
but keeping your personal
safety in mind,

34:25.226 --> 34:26.726
I strongly recommend against you

34:26.728 --> 34:28.561
going in the premises
at this time.

34:28.563 --> 34:29.628
I heard what you said, Jack,

34:29.630 --> 34:31.313
and I understand why
you had to say it.

34:31.315 --> 34:32.264
Did you hear him?

34:32.266 --> 34:33.565
I did.
Yes, sir.

34:33.568 --> 34:35.935
Good. I'm going in.

34:38.105 --> 34:40.139
Coming through!

34:56.991 --> 34:58.824
It's Commissioner Reagan.

34:58.826 --> 35:00.910
I'm coming in.

35:19.980 --> 35:21.731
What are you doing here?

35:24.568 --> 35:28.404
Responding to a 10-13--
officer needs assistance.

35:34.378 --> 35:35.661
Lower your weapon.

35:35.663 --> 35:38.364
I won't talk to a man
with a gun to his head.

35:53.230 --> 35:57.549
I'm not going to try
and take it away from you.

36:19.089 --> 36:23.009
I took an oath
to protect and to serve,

36:23.011 --> 36:25.911
and I did neither.

36:27.631 --> 36:29.415
I killed an innocent man.

36:31.584 --> 36:32.935
You did.

36:32.937 --> 36:34.887
How am I supposed
to live with that?

36:34.889 --> 36:37.056
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

36:40.227 --> 36:44.814
There's too many people ahead
of you on the sympathy line.

36:44.816 --> 36:46.482
You're still here.

36:46.484 --> 36:48.267
He's not.

36:50.237 --> 36:52.455
If I could take his place...

36:52.457 --> 36:55.107
Well, you can't.

36:58.495 --> 37:02.114
What you can do
is even the score--

37:02.116 --> 37:04.333
maybe someday save a life

37:04.335 --> 37:06.702
for the one
you accidentally took.

37:12.476 --> 37:14.260
At this point, how can I?

37:14.262 --> 37:16.095
By sticking around.

37:20.267 --> 37:22.601
Otherwise...

37:22.603 --> 37:25.771
you're just one of those
good men who did nothing.

37:36.649 --> 37:40.453
Son...

37:40.455 --> 37:44.323
you can't take back
what's been done.

37:46.159 --> 37:48.494
Nobody can.

37:52.999 --> 37:55.584
I need you to do
something for me.

37:58.271 --> 37:59.855
Try to find your way back

37:59.857 --> 38:02.408
to the man I met
in my office this morning.

38:32.172 --> 38:34.440
♪ ♪

38:49.055 --> 38:50.889
Ten-hut.

39:18.501 --> 39:20.135
Wasn't worried a bit.

39:20.137 --> 39:21.804
He had my lucky
rabbit's foot.

39:21.806 --> 39:23.305
You mean my lucky
rabbit's foot.

39:23.307 --> 39:24.807
I thought it was mine.

39:24.809 --> 39:26.642
Don't worry.
It's still yours.

39:26.644 --> 39:30.045
We're just happy that you
came back in one piece.

39:30.047 --> 39:31.930
Seriously, from now on,
anybody Danny arrests

39:31.932 --> 39:34.283
gets sent away with a plate
of homemade cookies

39:34.285 --> 39:36.986
and a note that says,
"Nothing personal."

39:36.988 --> 39:39.488
Well, all jokes aside,
I do want to take

39:39.490 --> 39:42.774
a moment and acknowledge
someone special.

39:42.776 --> 39:44.660
'Cause I never would
have got through this

39:44.662 --> 39:47.079
if I didn't have the best
partner a cop could have.

39:47.081 --> 39:49.131
Yeah, Jackie
is getting homemade cookies,

39:49.133 --> 39:51.333
flowers, a cake...

39:51.335 --> 39:53.619
I was talking about you.

39:56.056 --> 39:58.057
Aw.

39:58.059 --> 40:00.676
Uncle Danny, that was
the sweetest thing ever.

40:00.678 --> 40:02.761
It really was.
I might cry.

40:02.763 --> 40:03.846
Aw.

40:03.848 --> 40:05.097
I might puke.

40:05.099 --> 40:06.932
Jamie!

40:11.354 --> 40:12.938
Everything okay, Francis?

40:13.773 --> 40:15.307
Never better, Pop.

40:15.309 --> 40:16.742
Erin?

40:16.744 --> 40:19.278
Sure, Dad.

40:20.247 --> 40:22.448
Bless us, Our Lord,
and these, Thy gifts,

40:22.450 --> 40:23.599
we are about to receive

40:23.601 --> 40:25.134
from Thy bounty
through Christ Our Lord.

40:25.136 --> 40:26.168
Amen.

40:26.170 --> 40:27.819
Amen.
