These aren't goldfish!

Yes! I ran out
of detergent!

wasn't always so cranky

Hey, Donatello,

02:49.602 --> 02:50.768
maybe one of your
inventions

02:50.770 --> 02:52.337
could put him
in a better mood.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.772
Oh, no way.
Remember what happened

02:54.774 --> 02:57.342

Alterator on Leonardo?

02:57.344 --> 02:59.043
Yeah, for sure.

crime in our city.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.826
But, Chief! Crime
is on the decrease!

03:14.828 --> 03:18.696
Don't confuse the issue
with the facts.
It's Sweeps Week!

03:18.698 --> 03:21.533
Now get out there
and start covering it!

Hey! Wait!

doing just that.

Okay. Now where
does Donatello keep
that stupid iron?

03:58.904 --> 04:00.238
There it is.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.939
Aw, great!

04:01.941 --> 04:03.641
Now how on earth
do I find

04:03.643 --> 04:06.177
which cord belongs
to which gadget?

Well, this must be it.

just look at this mess?

Well, busy hands
are happy hands!

What's Raphael's big
hang-up with birthdays
anyway?

04:29.670 --> 04:31.502
Maybe the dude's
afraid of becoming

04:31.504 --> 04:33.838
a Middle-Aged Mutant
Ninja Turtle.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.273
Well, whatever it is,
I sure wish

04:35.275 --> 04:37.175
he'd snap out of
his crabby mood.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.410
Hello, fellas!

04:39.412 --> 04:41.613
Is this a gorgeous day
or what?

04:45.919 --> 04:48.687
Oh, oh, and don't
you even think about
touching those dishes.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.521
I'll do them later.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.223
Which reminds me,

04:52.225 --> 04:54.659
when is the last time
I took everybody out
for pizza?

04:54.661 --> 04:56.460
Hey. What do you say, guys?

04:56.462 --> 04:57.628
My treat!

04:57.630 --> 05:00.498
No, no. I'll go
get your coats.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.667
Who was that
masked turtle?

05:13.111 --> 05:16.547
Hi. Hope we're not too late
to make a withdrawal.

05:16.549 --> 05:19.216
Uh, sure.
Help yourselves.

05:20.085 --> 05:22.620
Man, I could hardly wait
to wrap my chops

05:22.622 --> 05:24.889
around a Vinnie's
special pizza.

05:24.891 --> 05:28.325
Yeah. Me, too.
Now if we could only
get Raphael to cooperate.

05:29.595 --> 05:30.695
[brakes screech]

05:30.697 --> 05:32.664
Now you go straight
home, Mrs. Cat.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.964
Go on. Go on!

05:33.966 --> 05:36.167

little kitties of yours

05:36.169 --> 05:37.401

05:37.403 --> 05:39.236
What's with Rafael?
[cars honking]

05:39.238 --> 05:42.707
He's turned so sweet
and-- bleah-- lovable!

05:42.709 --> 05:46.277
Yeah. He's gone from
Mr. Mean to Mr. Rogers.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.879
Maybe it's
some kind of flu.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.914
Well, whatever it is,
I hope it lasts.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.649
I kind of like him
this way!

05:51.651 --> 05:53.250

Scope it out, dudes!

05:53.252 --> 05:54.619

the Crosstown Bank!

van as their getaway car!

Well, what are we
waiting for?
Let's take 'em!

06:13.840 --> 06:15.073
What about Rafael?

06:15.075 --> 06:16.407
He's covering the back.

06:16.409 --> 06:19.144
Okay.
We got everything.

there, punks!

to buckle up!

just use my news van

06:53.446 --> 06:55.246
to pull off
that bank robbery!

I've got a bigger
surprise for you.

them make their getaway.

you do that?

a little niceness.

use more of it.

you do it?

those crooks rob the bank!

a little sunshine

this nice guy stuff?

bad guys, not help 'em!

you're right.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.917

09:33.806 --> 09:36.573
Enjoy the rest
of your stay
in our friendly city.

09:36.575 --> 09:39.376
[applause, cheering]

09:40.879 --> 09:44.214
[panting]
Iggy, these guys
won't quit!

09:44.216 --> 09:46.350
[Iggy]
Give them a taste
of the laser blasters.

09:51.723 --> 09:53.457
Out of the way,
brat!

09:53.459 --> 09:57.128
You big bully!
[crying]

09:57.130 --> 09:59.963
There, there.
What is wrong,
little boy?

09:59.965 --> 10:03.634
Those guys ruined
my popcorn.

10:03.636 --> 10:06.103
Aw, don't
you cry, fella.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.405
We can soon fix that.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.074
<i>[roaring]</i>

10:10.076 --> 10:13.510
[audience yelling]

10:16.448 --> 10:17.715
[Man]
Get a move on!

10:17.717 --> 10:20.250
Back off, turtles.
We mean business!

10:20.252 --> 10:23.687
Time to give
these amateurs the hook.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.391
Hey, w-what the--

10:27.393 --> 10:29.760
[grunting]

10:29.762 --> 10:31.261
Congrats, dudes.

10:31.263 --> 10:33.464
You just broke
into the movies!

10:33.466 --> 10:36.500
[cheering, whistling]

10:37.502 --> 10:39.436
I think
we lost Raphael.

10:39.438 --> 10:41.572
If only it were
that easy.

10:41.574 --> 10:44.508
[chatter]

10:44.510 --> 10:45.542
[laughing]

10:45.544 --> 10:46.777
Oh, don't shove,
kids.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.846
I brought enough
for everyone.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.113
[Leonardo]
April, thanks

10:50.115 --> 10:52.550
for dropping
those punks off
at the police station.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.652
Yeah, and returning
the stolen money
to the bank.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.986
That was easy.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.189
The hard part will be
explaining to Burne Thompson

10:58.191 --> 11:00.023
how the news van
got wrecked.

11:00.025 --> 11:02.492
Oh, I'm sure
he'll understand.

11:02.494 --> 11:05.762
You see, deep down,
he's a really
gentle soul...

11:05.764 --> 11:07.432
[laughing]
much like myself.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.634
Dudes, we gotta
do something.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.969
All this sweetness
is giving me cavities!

11:11.971 --> 11:14.271
And worse, it's
ruining our image

11:14.273 --> 11:16.607
as heroic fighters
against the forces
of evil.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.343
Yeah, there's
got to be some way
to get Raphael

11:19.345 --> 11:22.079
back to being
his old, nasty self.
But how?

11:22.081 --> 11:24.415
Guys, I think
I found the answer.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.117
[Leonardo]
A psychiatrist?

11:26.119 --> 11:27.385
[Donatello]
Exactly.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.153
He'll get to the bottom
of Raphael's problem.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.421
Righteous notion, dude!

11:31.423 --> 11:32.790
He's got nothing to lose

11:32.792 --> 11:33.858
but his mind.

11:38.564 --> 11:39.997
This is the place.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.599
The Von Shrink Institute
of Mental Health.

11:44.002 --> 11:45.802
My goodness,

11:45.804 --> 11:48.072
what a really nice place!

11:50.709 --> 11:52.443
<i>Hello. May I help you?</i>

11:52.445 --> 11:55.746
Yes, I have
an appointment
with Dr. Von Shrink.

11:55.748 --> 11:57.581
My name is Raphael.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.916
<i>Ah, yes,</i>

11:58.918 --> 12:00.951
<i>the one who's suffering</i>
<i>from over-niceness.</i>

12:00.953 --> 12:02.619
Yes, but I ask you,

12:02.621 --> 12:04.755
can anyone really
be too nice?

12:04.757 --> 12:07.324
<i>Please follow me.</i>

12:11.430 --> 12:13.998
Uh, let me put this
delicately.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.467
Ahem.
A-A-Aren't you a robot?

12:16.469 --> 12:18.435
<i>Yes, I am X-12.</i>

12:18.437 --> 12:20.704
Well, what a really
nice letter,

12:20.706 --> 12:22.140
and a nice number, too.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.774
<i>Dr. Von Shrink employs</i>

12:23.776 --> 12:26.177
<i>the latest advances</i>
<i>in robotic technology</i>

12:26.179 --> 12:29.080
<i>in order to promote</i>
<i>state-of-the-art</i>
<i>psychoanalysis.</i>

12:29.082 --> 12:30.815
<i>Next patient.</i>

12:36.121 --> 12:39.056
[gasps]
How wonderfully
efficient.

12:39.058 --> 12:41.759
<i>Here we have</i>
<i>our shock treatment</i>
<i>room.</i>

12:45.730 --> 12:47.631
[shrieking]

12:51.036 --> 12:53.270
<i>And this is</i>
<i>our assertiveness</i>
<i>training center.</i>

12:57.909 --> 13:00.577
[zap]
[growling]

13:00.579 --> 13:02.313
[all]
Oh!

13:02.315 --> 13:06.216
Oh, what a truly
wonderful experience!

13:06.218 --> 13:09.487
<i>And this is the office</i>
<i>of our founding genius,</i>

13:09.489 --> 13:12.023
<i>Dr. Otto Von Shrink.</i>

13:13.224 --> 13:14.491
<i>Dr. Von Shrink,</i>

13:14.493 --> 13:17.795
<i>this is the patient</i>
<i>known as Raphael.</i>

13:17.797 --> 13:20.530
The one they call
Mr. Nice Guy.

13:20.532 --> 13:21.966
It certainly
is nice to meet

13:21.968 --> 13:24.634
a nice person like you
in this really nice place.

13:24.636 --> 13:27.071
Nicely put.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.173
We will start
by trying to determine

13:29.175 --> 13:30.908
the root of your problem.

13:30.910 --> 13:34.411
X-12, activate
the Cranial Regressor.

13:34.413 --> 13:35.813
[beeps]

13:35.815 --> 13:37.714
Now, this will
take you back

13:37.716 --> 13:41.252
to your earliest memory
of being sickeningly nice.

13:43.555 --> 13:46.023
A Personality Alterator.

13:46.025 --> 13:48.359
So that is the secret.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.627
With a device like that
at my disposal,

13:50.629 --> 13:52.096
I could make millions!

13:52.098 --> 13:54.665
Uh, I mean, cure millions.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.601
You're such
a nice person.

13:56.603 --> 14:00.371
All right, X-12,
the session is now over.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.772
[beeps]

14:01.774 --> 14:03.674
Raphael,
you must bring me

14:03.676 --> 14:05.575
the Personality
Alterator

14:05.577 --> 14:07.444
so that I can
study it further.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.013
I'd be happy to, Doctor.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.381
Can I bring
anything else?

14:10.383 --> 14:11.849
Uh, a drink?
A snack?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.819
No, no, just
the Personality Alterator.

14:14.821 --> 14:18.122
However, well,
maybe a prune Danish
would be nice.

14:22.593 --> 14:24.428
Did you
hear that, X-12?

14:24.430 --> 14:26.530
A Personality
Alterator.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.900
Think about it,
with a device
like that,

14:28.902 --> 14:30.701
I can control
the personalities

14:30.703 --> 14:32.603
of everyone
in the city!

14:32.605 --> 14:34.971
At last, I shall
have my revenge

14:34.973 --> 14:38.575
on the Psychiatric Society
for humiliating me,

14:38.577 --> 14:40.378
Call me a crackpot,
will they?

14:40.380 --> 14:43.347
[both laughing]

14:49.287 --> 14:51.822
[Donatello]
Ugh, these scientific
journals

14:51.824 --> 14:53.257
certainly pile up.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.958
I'd better turn them in
for recycling.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.460
Whoa! Oh!

14:57.395 --> 14:59.530
Huh, what's
my Personality Alterator

14:59.532 --> 15:00.998
doing on the floor?

15:01.000 --> 15:04.435
[growling]

15:06.738 --> 15:09.306
So that's what
happened to Raphael.

15:09.308 --> 15:12.242
The Alterator rays
turned him into a nice guy!

15:12.244 --> 15:13.978
[lips smacking]

15:15.380 --> 15:16.647
Hi, fellas.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.916
Oh, don't you get up,
it's only me.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.218
Hey, dude, how'd
your shrink session go?

15:21.220 --> 15:23.386
Oh, extremely well.

15:23.388 --> 15:27.058
Dr. Von Shrink
is such a nice person.
Ugh!

15:27.060 --> 15:29.426
Oh, I am so sorry,
Donatello.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.628
if there was any damage,
you feel free

15:31.630 --> 15:34.198
to take it
out of the piggy bank
on my dresser.

15:36.501 --> 15:38.569
Guys, I know what
happened to Raphael.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.005
He got zapped
by my Personality
Alterator,

15:41.007 --> 15:42.373
and it
turned him nice.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.576
So, in other words,
you created a "Nicenstein."

15:45.578 --> 15:46.910
Nicely put.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.079
But how do we get
the old Raphael back?

15:49.081 --> 15:51.182
Oh, simple, we zap him
with a reverse ray,

15:51.184 --> 15:52.816
and he'll be back
to his old, cranky,

15:52.818 --> 15:54.218
bad-guy-fighting self.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.052
Well,
let's do it, dude.

16:00.625 --> 16:01.992
Oh, no!

16:01.994 --> 16:04.394
My Personality
Alterator is gone!

16:04.396 --> 16:06.263
And so is Raphael.

16:07.398 --> 16:09.266
[Von Shrink]
More soldering wire,
Raphael.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.601
With the greatest
of pleasure, Doctor.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.370
Have I told you
what an honor it is

16:13.372 --> 16:15.305
to work with
a great benefactor
like yourself?

16:15.307 --> 16:17.708
Too many times.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.142
Oh, not possible.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.344
A genius like you

16:20.346 --> 16:22.546
deserves to be praised
to the skies,

16:22.548 --> 16:24.482
you, good, good person.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.082
I'm beginning to see

16:26.084 --> 16:29.152
why your friends
want to change you.

16:30.021 --> 16:32.023
At last, it's ready!

16:32.025 --> 16:35.459
Welding this battery pack
to the Personality Alterator

16:35.461 --> 16:37.928
has made it
completely portable.

16:37.930 --> 16:41.865
With it, I can turn
every policeman
and security guard

16:41.867 --> 16:44.201
into a mild-mannered
mush.

16:44.203 --> 16:47.137
And while my robots
pick this city clean,

16:47.139 --> 16:49.640
they'll be too
well-mannered
to stop them.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.908
But, Doctor--
[chuckles]--

16:50.910 --> 16:52.609
uh, I'm a crime fighter!

16:52.611 --> 16:54.345
Why are you
telling me this?

16:54.347 --> 16:58.081
Because you're too nice
to do anything about it.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.549
Hmm. He's right.

17:01.018 --> 17:03.053
[wind blowing]

17:04.789 --> 17:07.358
<i>Remember, only the most</i>
<i>expensive items.</i>

17:07.359 --> 17:10.127
<i>No rhinestones, please.</i>

17:10.128 --> 17:12.730
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

17:12.732 --> 17:15.165
<i>At the risk</i>
<i>of being obvious,</i>

17:15.167 --> 17:16.633
<i>we're</i>
<i>stealing jewelry.</i>

17:18.170 --> 17:20.070
Huh? Ooo,
what's happening?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.204
I-I feel so strange!

17:23.641 --> 17:25.742
Don't forget to
take some watches!

17:25.743 --> 17:27.912
A person can't have
enough of them.

17:27.914 --> 17:31.648
I hope you remembered
to pick out something
for your moms.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.951
Mother's Day is
coming up soon!

17:40.025 --> 17:41.458
Hold it!
Stop right there!

17:47.098 --> 17:50.367
Well, let us carry those
heavy bars for ya.
Heh heh heh.

17:53.037 --> 17:55.806
And while we're here,
would you like us to
rotate your tires?

17:55.808 --> 17:57.607
<i>That won't be necessary.</i>

17:57.609 --> 17:59.243
<i>The bank guards</i>
<i>already did that.</i>

18:00.578 --> 18:01.712
All right.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.047
No, I see.
Thank you!

18:04.049 --> 18:05.349
Well? Any luck?

18:05.351 --> 18:07.118
I check out
the entire sewer.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.719
There's not
a sign of Rafael

18:08.721 --> 18:10.621
or the Personality
Alterator!

18:10.623 --> 18:13.390
Von Shrink claims he
hasn't seen him all day!

18:13.392 --> 18:16.059
I still don't trust
that doctor, dude.

18:16.061 --> 18:18.195
Hey, guys!
Check this out!

18:18.197 --> 18:21.899
<i>This is April O'Neil,</i>
<i>at the Museum of</i>
<i>Priceless Art,</i>

18:21.901 --> 18:25.035
<i>where bandits just made off</i>
<i>with the entire collection.</i>

18:25.037 --> 18:27.003
<i>I understand that</i>
<i>even though the robbers</i>

18:27.005 --> 18:29.106
<i>were unarmed,</i>
<i>you let them walk out</i>

18:29.108 --> 18:30.841
<i>with every single</i>
<i>painting.</i>

18:30.843 --> 18:33.743
<i>Well, I didn't want</i>
<i>to hurt their feelings</i>
<i>by saying no.</i>

18:33.745 --> 18:35.545
<i>They seemed like</i>
<i>such nice fellows.</i>

18:35.547 --> 18:36.780
That's it!

18:36.782 --> 18:39.717
Someone is using my
Personality Alterator!

18:39.719 --> 18:42.752
And the dudes are using it
to make everyone nice!

18:42.754 --> 18:44.421
But how could they have
gotten hold of it?

18:44.423 --> 18:47.491
Rafael was the only one who
knew about it besides us.

18:47.493 --> 18:48.759
And who would he tell?

18:48.761 --> 18:51.028
[All]
Dr. Von Shrink!

18:57.802 --> 18:59.637
Okay, guys. All clear.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.307
Hmm. I wonder which way
to Von Shrink's office.

19:05.509 --> 19:07.677
[Leonardo]
I think we're about
to find out.

19:07.679 --> 19:08.879
Whoa!
Hey!

19:12.317 --> 19:14.485
Isn't that nice, Rafael?

19:14.487 --> 19:18.422
Strangers everywhere
are donating their
valuables to me!

19:18.424 --> 19:19.790
And who
can blame them?

19:19.792 --> 19:22.025
Just thinking about
your niceness

19:22.027 --> 19:25.095
makes me all warm
and fuzzy inside.

19:25.097 --> 19:28.832
Good. Now go help the robots
unload the getaway car.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.633
How could I ever
say no to you?

19:33.071 --> 19:36.906
That turtle is definitely
getting on my nerves.

19:36.908 --> 19:39.042
[alarm]
Okay, Sigmundo.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.111
Your 50 minutes are up!

19:41.113 --> 19:42.479
What the--?

19:42.481 --> 19:45.316
Time to hand over that
Alterator, Von Shrimp!

19:45.318 --> 19:47.717
Did you think it would
be that simple?

19:48.953 --> 19:50.020
What's happening?

19:50.022 --> 19:52.089
It's some kind
of force field.

19:52.091 --> 19:55.058
My shell-backed friends,
you have the honor

19:55.060 --> 19:57.494
of testing
my newest invention!

19:57.496 --> 19:59.229
The Phobia Chamber!

19:59.231 --> 20:01.065
A device
to help my patients

20:01.067 --> 20:03.166
overcome
their greatest fears

20:03.168 --> 20:04.200
by facing them.

20:05.336 --> 20:08.872
Dudes, something
weird's going on.

20:08.874 --> 20:09.806
Yipes!

20:13.111 --> 20:14.745
I-I'll second that!

20:17.048 --> 20:18.248
Oh! A pizza?

20:18.250 --> 20:19.750
Whoa, Doc Dude!

20:19.752 --> 20:22.852
You really
blew it this time!
Not really.

20:22.854 --> 20:26.256
This pizza eats turtles!
[laughing]

20:28.093 --> 20:29.993
Aah!

20:29.995 --> 20:32.262
Well, hi, guys!

20:32.264 --> 20:34.264
What a pleasant surprise.

20:34.266 --> 20:36.967
[grunts]
Rafael! Help us!

20:36.969 --> 20:40.003
Dr. Von Shrink,
what's going on?

20:40.005 --> 20:41.505
Merely a little therapy.

20:41.507 --> 20:44.475
I'm teaching your friends
to face their fears.

20:44.477 --> 20:48.278
Don't believe him, dude!
He's really a bad guy!

20:48.280 --> 20:50.447
Michelangelo's right!

20:50.449 --> 20:52.515
He's been lying to you
all along!

20:55.086 --> 20:56.786
I hope this works!

21:03.761 --> 21:04.695
Hey!

21:04.697 --> 21:06.664
What are you doing
to my turtle buds?

21:06.666 --> 21:08.332
Donatello!
You did it!

21:08.334 --> 21:10.800
You changed
Rafael back!

21:10.802 --> 21:13.603
Yeah! And I'm back
with a vengeance!

21:15.373 --> 21:16.306
[buzzing]

21:24.549 --> 21:25.482
You traitor!

21:25.484 --> 21:27.184
How could you
do this?

21:27.186 --> 21:28.218
Sorry, Doc.

21:28.220 --> 21:31.454
But my mental health
just got healthier.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.590
That's it!
Way to go!

21:33.592 --> 21:35.659
The therapy
isn't over yet!

21:36.660 --> 21:38.661
Meet my enforcer robots!

21:38.663 --> 21:40.097
They're the same ones
I use

21:40.099 --> 21:41.431
when you don't
pay your bill.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.701
[All]
Turtles fight with honor!

21:43.703 --> 21:46.870
Let a slightly-used
ex-Mr. Nice Guy
handle this?

21:49.440 --> 21:52.475
Six against one!
I like the odds!

21:58.016 --> 22:00.383
Oh, no! What's going on?

22:03.354 --> 22:05.155
[explosion]

22:05.157 --> 22:08.926
My loyal robots,
blown to pieces!

22:08.928 --> 22:10.560
Well, if you think
that was something,

22:10.562 --> 22:12.996
watch this!

22:12.998 --> 22:15.231
W-W-What are you doing?

22:15.233 --> 22:16.767
What's happening to me?

22:16.769 --> 22:18.935
I feel so-- so nice.

22:18.937 --> 22:20.470
Welcome to the club,
Doc.

22:20.472 --> 22:23.706
Gosh. I certainly hope
you can stay for milk
and cookies.

22:23.708 --> 22:25.476
Well, one thing's
for sure.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.578
The dude's gonna make
a model prisoner.

22:30.281 --> 22:31.381
[Turtles]
Surprise!

22:31.383 --> 22:33.784
Yay! Happy Birthday,
Rafael!

22:33.786 --> 22:36.219
Aw, you guys!
I told you not
to do this!

22:36.221 --> 22:37.621
I hate birthdays!

22:37.623 --> 22:39.990
You gotta ride
with the tide, dude!

22:39.992 --> 22:41.625
Oh, and speaking
of tides,

22:41.627 --> 22:43.327
Here's a little
present for ya.

22:43.329 --> 22:46.263
Oh, swell. A present
I have to feed!

22:46.265 --> 22:48.498
Well, here's one
that feeds you!

22:48.500 --> 22:50.467
A birthday cake?
Exactly!

22:50.469 --> 22:52.603
Now make a wish,
and blow out the candle.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.605
[sighs]
Okay! Here goes...

22:54.607 --> 22:55.672
[inhales]

22:57.441 --> 22:58.808
[groans]
Bleah!

22:58.810 --> 23:00.110
[Rafael]
Well, what do you know?

23:00.112 --> 23:02.846
Ha ha!
My wish came true.

23:02.848 --> 23:14.591
That's our Rafael!

23:14.593 --> 23:17.527
