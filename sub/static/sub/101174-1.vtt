NETFLIX PRESENTS

02:58.916 --> 02:59.875
That's him!

03:00.250 --> 03:03.000
{\an8}Valentín Esparza!
We just want to speak to you!

03:03.083 --> 03:04.083
{\an8}-Halt!
-Stop!

03:06.458 --> 03:07.625
Halt!

03:08.541 --> 03:10.708
{\an8}-Halt!
-Stop! I said, stop!

03:12.166 --> 03:13.666
-Hey!
-Stop!

03:19.125 --> 03:20.083
Freeze!

03:22.750 --> 03:24.291
{\an8}-Halt!
-Halt! Damn!

03:56.375 --> 03:57.500
Where has he gone?

03:57.625 --> 03:59.208
-Where?
-That way!

04:03.250 --> 04:04.333
{\an8}Valentín!

04:05.625 --> 04:06.750
{\an8}Halt!

04:11.625 --> 04:12.833
Freeze!

04:15.125 --> 04:16.875
Jonan! Get the backpack.

04:16.958 --> 04:17.916
Don't move.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.083
Don't move!

04:22.000 --> 04:23.208
Your arm!

04:23.625 --> 04:25.333
I have to finish this.

04:26.541 --> 04:28.041
I must finish it.

04:30.083 --> 04:31.083
I have to.

04:32.791 --> 04:34.083
I have to finish it!

05:00.708 --> 05:02.000
May I sit down?

05:05.500 --> 05:07.291
By this time of day, I'm beat.

05:07.375 --> 05:10.166
I had a baby 5 months ago.
Don't get much sleep.

05:11.541 --> 05:14.041
Unbelievable how a baby changes your life.

05:15.333 --> 05:18.333
I'm not surprised
that some people lose their mind.

05:19.208 --> 05:22.083
-How old was your daughter?
-Four months.

05:25.875 --> 05:29.833
-Where were you taking her?
-I just wanted to have her a bit longer.

05:30.416 --> 05:33.250
Your mother-in-law says
you went to her house at night.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.833
She heard a noise
and saw you running away.

05:36.291 --> 05:38.375
She cried while she told us.

05:38.458 --> 05:40.125
My mother-in-law lies a lot.

05:40.541 --> 05:44.625
She isn't lying when she says the baby
had a mark on her forehead.

05:45.250 --> 05:46.916
It wasn't there at bedtime.

05:47.750 --> 05:52.166
A mark from an object pressed to her face.
It's the exact size of the doll's eye.

05:53.416 --> 05:55.291
My mother-in-law is a bitch.

05:56.500 --> 06:00.166
You saw the mark too, Valentín.
You covered it with makeup

06:00.541 --> 06:03.125
and ordered them
to close the coffin quickly.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.500
But she wasn't going to give up.

06:05.958 --> 06:08.041
That's why you took the body, right?

06:08.125 --> 06:11.000
No. That was because they wanted
to cremate her.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.583
-You wanted a burial.
-They mustn't cremate her.

06:13.666 --> 06:14.500
I must finish.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.000
Finish what, Valentín?

06:17.125 --> 06:20.458
If I don't,
this will have been for nothing.

06:20.541 --> 06:22.166
What's it supposed to be for?

06:29.333 --> 06:30.916
Did you kill your daughter?

06:32.083 --> 06:33.000
No.

06:34.125 --> 06:35.583
I didn't kill her.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.541
I gave her up.

06:38.416 --> 06:39.583
To whom?

06:41.916 --> 06:43.416
Who'd you give her up to?

06:45.833 --> 06:46.791
What for?

06:49.250 --> 06:50.875
Tell them not to cremate her.

06:51.625 --> 06:52.666
Please...

06:53.291 --> 06:55.458
They mustn't cremate her.

06:55.916 --> 06:56.916
<i>Who?</i>

07:00.125 --> 07:01.833
<i>Who did you give her up to?</i>

07:01.958 --> 07:05.166
He moves his lips,
but you can't tell what he's saying.

07:06.833 --> 07:12.000
Goñi, see what you can do with the sound.
Or call someone who can read lips.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.083
Sure, boss.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.333
And someone fix the coffee machine.

07:15.416 --> 07:17.250
-What does it take?
-I'm on it.

07:23.625 --> 07:26.916
The river was swollen.
It's impossible Mom survived.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.958
I spoke to the judge
in charge of the case.

07:30.041 --> 07:32.083
He agrees we should hold the funeral.

07:32.166 --> 07:35.791
-You called Judge Markina?
-He called me. A charming man.

07:36.208 --> 07:40.416
I spoke to Father Germán,
and we decided Friday is the best day.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.958
-We decided?
-Yes.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.500
The sooner the better for all of us.

07:44.625 --> 07:47.125
We can't be sure Mom's dead
till the body turns up.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.333
Don't be ridiculous.

07:48.416 --> 07:50.625
They found her coat
in the river a month ago.

07:50.708 --> 07:52.750
It was to throw us off. It means nothing.

07:52.833 --> 07:54.333
I think it's a good idea.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.541
We have to move on.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.833
-I don't believe Mom's dead.
-Then where is she?

08:01.916 --> 08:04.500
On her own, at night. Barely able to walk.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.416
That is not true!

08:06.500 --> 08:08.916
So what? Enough already!

08:10.958 --> 08:12.208
Mom is dead.

08:18.208 --> 08:20.958
If you need help
with the preparations, count on me.

08:21.416 --> 08:22.500
Fair enough.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.166
Amaia...

09:33.625 --> 09:36.166
-Amaia, sweetie...
-Not now, Auntie, please.

09:38.958 --> 09:39.958
Please...

10:17.708 --> 10:20.208
PAMPLONA I PENITENTIARY CENTER

10:20.333 --> 10:25.583
I'm merely the stage director
of a play that has many actors.

10:26.416 --> 10:27.541
Are you?

10:28.166 --> 10:29.833
In the images of your escape

10:30.000 --> 10:33.416
we see a submissive stage director
obeying an old woman.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.625
In short, one missing,
the other behind bars.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.500
Some stage director.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.250
You're mistaken, inspector.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.416
It was a male baby,
but the rest was as expected.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.750
Where'd they get the arm
left in the church?

10:46.833 --> 10:49.833
-Did Rosario tell them?
-What are you talking about?

10:50.958 --> 10:52.375
When you came to Baztan,

10:52.458 --> 10:54.916
you didn't stay with your father
or at a hotel.

10:55.291 --> 10:56.791
You've a house somewhere.

10:56.875 --> 10:59.291
My mother went
there when she left the cave.

10:59.375 --> 11:00.833
Where's that house?

11:03.583 --> 11:04.958
She's alive, isn't she?

11:07.958 --> 11:08.958
What do you think?

11:09.041 --> 11:11.125
You prepared an escape plan.
She followed it.

11:12.750 --> 11:15.833
One has to be intelligent
to appreciate intelligence.

11:16.708 --> 11:19.083
You and I recognized that in each other.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.125
Just for that, here's a gift.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.833
Listen carefully.

11:25.708 --> 11:27.541
It's a message from your mother.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.750
Sleep with one eye open, little bitch,

11:35.500 --> 11:39.625
because sooner or later,
Mommy will eat you.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.458
Open the door!

11:45.583 --> 11:46.916
Open it!

11:48.083 --> 11:49.833
Didn't you hear me? Open it!

12:04.916 --> 12:09.041
He saw your weakness and attacked you.
He didn't really have a message.

12:09.125 --> 12:12.000
<i>He controls the guards.</i>
<i>They obey him like dogs.</i>

12:12.083 --> 12:13.000
Where are you?

12:13.416 --> 12:14.625
<i>I'm heading there now.</i>

12:14.750 --> 12:16.750
Call the warden.
Ask to put him in solitary.

12:16.833 --> 12:17.750
<i>Of course.</i>

12:17.833 --> 12:19.958
I'm really sorry about what happened.

12:20.333 --> 12:21.500
Let's meet tonight.

12:21.583 --> 12:22.750
<i>I'll pick you up.</i>

12:22.833 --> 12:25.583
Inform the prison as soon as possible.

12:25.666 --> 12:28.333
<i>-I have to go. I've got a call.</i>
-All right.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.000
Yes, Jonan?

12:34.708 --> 12:38.000
We left all the flowers
and bouquets very carefully.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.708
When we arrived today,
they'd all been moved.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.583
Everything was scattered.

12:42.666 --> 12:45.875
The cemetery manager says the stone
has been moved.

12:46.041 --> 12:47.125
This way...

12:59.291 --> 13:00.916
They moved that, ma'am.

13:14.833 --> 13:16.125
It's empty.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.541
Call the prison.
Tell them we'll talk to Esparza.

13:33.625 --> 13:36.291
We should've buried her
next to the farmhouse.

13:36.375 --> 13:39.375
And you should stop looking
for flesh-and-blood killers.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.583
Inguma killed our baby.

13:43.208 --> 13:44.416
Boss.

13:47.291 --> 13:49.500
-Yes?
-Esparza has been murdered.

13:51.083 --> 13:52.083
What?

13:53.166 --> 13:55.416
His cellmate suddenly stabbed him.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.166
He was a quiet inmate.
No one understands it.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.458
And the interrogation?

14:00.541 --> 14:03.208
I went over the audio
with a speech therapist.

14:05.083 --> 14:08.166
"I gave her up to Inguma,
like so many other sacrifices."

14:09.125 --> 14:10.375
Play it again.

14:13.125 --> 14:16.208
"I gave her up to Inguma,
like so many other sacrifices."

14:18.208 --> 14:19.208
"Inguma."

14:19.458 --> 14:21.791
One of the oldest demons in mythology.

14:21.958 --> 14:26.333
He kills people while they're asleep
and causes the sudden death of babies.

14:26.708 --> 14:29.208
He sucks out their breath until they die.

14:29.583 --> 14:30.458
Let me see.

14:31.666 --> 14:33.041
Thanks, Goñi.

14:36.750 --> 14:40.083
When I saw the empty coffin,
all I could think about was my sister's,

14:40.958 --> 14:43.250
but they didn't even bother
putting in gravel.

14:43.833 --> 14:45.041
I want to investigate

14:45.125 --> 14:48.250
all cases of sudden infant death
in the last five years.

14:49.000 --> 14:49.916
Okay.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.666
Elena?

14:59.125 --> 15:00.375
It's Amaia Salazar.

15:03.666 --> 15:05.583
They're the same symbols

15:05.708 --> 15:09.083
the master used to draw
when we sacrificed animals, but...

15:09.833 --> 15:11.500
I don't know what they mean.

15:12.625 --> 15:17.083
I know that my mother didn't die
and that she's hiding somewhere.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.666
I must find the house where you met.
The farmhouse you told me about.

15:22.166 --> 15:25.041
It's very important that you answer me.
I'm begging you.

15:26.791 --> 15:30.291
-Did they ever make human sacrifices?
-Don't you understand?

15:30.833 --> 15:33.833
-If I talk, they'll kill me!
-Who?

15:33.916 --> 15:35.666
I can offer you protection.

15:35.750 --> 15:38.125
-You can't protect me from that.
-Please…

15:38.208 --> 15:40.000
Answer me, please.

15:40.625 --> 15:42.208
Were there human sacrifices?

15:45.041 --> 15:49.458
The only pregnant woman
in the group was your mother,

15:50.750 --> 15:55.208
so if you're alive,
that means it was all just talk.

15:56.833 --> 16:02.000
I've given thanks a thousand times
every time I've seen you.

16:02.083 --> 16:03.083
Elena...

16:03.833 --> 16:05.916
I was born along with another girl,

16:07.083 --> 16:09.416
a twin sister who died of crib death.

16:09.583 --> 16:10.541
Where is she?

16:10.666 --> 16:13.791
I don't know. I found the grave,
but the coffin was empty.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.500
No! Get out of my house!

16:15.583 --> 16:16.875
-Elena...
-Get out now!

16:16.958 --> 16:18.541
-It's important...
-Get out!

16:18.625 --> 16:20.083
-Go!
-Listen to me!

16:20.166 --> 16:24.750
At least tell me where the bodies are.
What did you do with the bodies? Please!

16:24.833 --> 16:27.958
-Elena, please!
-Get out of my house!

16:39.250 --> 16:41.541
{\an8}PAMPLONA PRISON

18:38.750 --> 18:41.500
He was in solitary. Hadn't spoken
to anyone since your visit.

18:41.875 --> 18:45.958
A guard saw he wasn't moving,
reported it, and we found him like this.

18:46.041 --> 18:51.000
He has no skin hemorrhages,
defensive wounds, or signs of suffering.

18:51.333 --> 18:54.083
Judging from the foam from his mouth,

18:54.208 --> 18:58.000
I'd say it was suicide
by something that caused heart failure.

18:59.291 --> 19:01.375
Dr. Berasategui didn't want to die.

19:01.791 --> 19:04.583
Suicide doesn't go
with narcissistic behavior.

19:04.666 --> 19:06.708
He didn't want to die?

19:07.250 --> 19:08.666
How can you know that?

19:10.916 --> 19:12.166
He cried while dying.

19:12.291 --> 19:15.583
He lay down, and in a fit of self-pity,
cried about his death.

19:22.375 --> 19:23.458
There.

19:23.541 --> 19:25.041
Camera number 5.

19:31.458 --> 19:32.875
He gave him something.

19:40.708 --> 19:41.666
Camera 9.

20:06.541 --> 20:07.666
Amaia!

20:08.625 --> 20:09.541
Your Honor.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.166
Is something the matter?

20:11.916 --> 20:14.541
You left without telling me
how you're doing.

20:15.791 --> 20:17.541
I'm fine, thank you.

20:18.541 --> 20:21.583
Remember, you can count on me
for whatever you need.

20:22.791 --> 20:24.750
-Thanks.
-I care about you, Amaia.

20:38.458 --> 20:42.375
My feelings for you haven't changed...

20:43.750 --> 20:44.833
and they won't.

20:53.375 --> 20:54.583
Your Honor!

20:55.750 --> 20:58.166
Did you call my sister about the funeral?

20:58.500 --> 21:00.333
I said it was a good idea, yes.

21:00.875 --> 21:02.458
But she called my office.

21:25.333 --> 21:28.916
-Did you visit Berasategui in prison?
-On three occasions.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.541
Did you mention Rosario's escape
and what happened that night?

21:32.625 --> 21:35.791
I tried each time, inspector,
but he changed the subject.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.416
I think my mother is hiding somewhere.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.791
And that all this is part
of a much more complex plan.

21:42.875 --> 21:45.291
I'm glad that you're starting
to understand.

21:46.041 --> 21:47.708
Think there could be a link

21:47.833 --> 21:52.166
between local ancient witchcraft practices
and what happened in this cave?

21:53.791 --> 21:56.583
Stories of witches eating children
are nothing new.

21:56.666 --> 22:00.666
-They fed off sacrificed innocents.
-What did they get in return?

22:01.458 --> 22:03.625
Health, life,

22:04.250 --> 22:05.541
material wealth...

22:05.625 --> 22:07.250
Do people still believe that?

22:07.333 --> 22:09.583
Stop questioning whether it's logical.

22:10.583 --> 22:11.625
Stop judging.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.875
Admit that when something
has real consequences, it's real.

22:19.041 --> 22:21.625
Why child sacrifices?
How did they use them?

22:23.250 --> 22:25.791
They need children under two years of age

22:25.875 --> 22:28.708
because until then,
they move between two worlds

22:28.875 --> 22:31.458
and can see and hear
what happens in both.

22:32.666 --> 22:34.458
They must be killed in a ritual.

22:35.458 --> 22:37.541
The most common
is to drain their blood,

22:37.625 --> 22:41.333
although they are sometimes
dismembered and the parts are used.

22:42.291 --> 22:45.583
The skulls and longer bones
are highly prized,

22:45.750 --> 22:49.541
but in certain practices,
they use nails, hair, and teeth,

22:49.958 --> 22:53.333
and the powder
from grinding their smaller bones.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.708
If a body was stolen,
where would they take it?

22:58.666 --> 23:01.708
To a magic place
that is safe and protected.

23:03.791 --> 23:07.500
I know that you're thinking of temples
or churches, inspector,

23:08.041 --> 23:10.541
but witchcraft isn't the same as Satanism.

23:10.666 --> 23:12.458
It doesn't seek to offend God,

23:13.041 --> 23:15.833
but rather to summon up
and worship the spirits.

23:16.666 --> 23:17.875
What spirits?

23:18.333 --> 23:20.291
Aker, for example.

23:20.375 --> 23:23.000
The devil has always gone
by that name in Baztan.

23:23.083 --> 23:24.291
Do you believe that?

23:24.375 --> 23:26.583
You're looking at it the wrong way again.

23:26.958 --> 23:30.625
Believing doesn't matter.
What matters is the power it creates.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.666
What matters is it has real consequences,

23:33.750 --> 23:37.416
and there are people
willing to die and kill for it.

23:54.416 --> 23:58.625
Sonia said Valentín talked endlessly
of traditions and the power of the earth.

23:59.458 --> 24:01.208
He asked her to have a home birth,

24:01.291 --> 24:03.541
but the baby was premature
and born in a hospital.

24:03.625 --> 24:04.708
Any midwife?

24:05.416 --> 24:07.625
Didn't mention it. I'll speak to her.

24:11.416 --> 24:12.666
It's Iriarte.

24:13.291 --> 24:17.000
In the last seven years,
five crib deaths of girls in Baztan.

24:17.083 --> 24:20.458
Social Services opened an investigation
in three of them.

24:20.541 --> 24:24.708
Ask them what caught their attention
and how the families reacted.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.041
Okay.

24:33.916 --> 24:37.125
<i>Attention all cars.</i>
<i>Go to Father Donostia Avenue. Over.</i>

24:37.500 --> 24:39.083
That's next to the bakery.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.375
Montes, what happened?

25:03.625 --> 25:05.500
A woman's body was found.

25:06.708 --> 25:08.000
Her daughter found her.

25:08.083 --> 25:10.750
She'd come from Pamplona.
Her mother wasn't picking up.

25:10.833 --> 25:13.875
The doctor who saw her
said there's something odd.

25:14.250 --> 25:15.333
Be up in a minute.

25:25.458 --> 25:26.458
Inspector.

25:46.708 --> 25:50.333
At first, I thought internal bleeding
had collapsed her lungs,

25:50.875 --> 25:51.875
but look...

25:53.000 --> 25:56.041
Her vomit is full
of small walnut shell splinters.

25:56.416 --> 25:58.541
They cut like razor blades.

25:58.666 --> 26:02.041
They must have perforated her stomach,
duodenum, and trachea.

26:02.125 --> 26:05.125
When she vomited them up,
they lacerated everything.

26:05.583 --> 26:08.541
It's a horrible way to commit suicide.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.958
My mother would never commit suicide.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.333
And she hated walnuts. They terrified her.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.458
As a kid, she made me swear
I'd never touch them.

26:31.333 --> 26:34.291
Did you notice anything strange
about her recently?

26:36.541 --> 26:39.708
In the past month,
she was very nervous, paranoid.

26:41.541 --> 26:43.666
But I couldn't get her
to tell me anything.

26:46.333 --> 26:47.333
Thank you.

26:52.625 --> 26:54.875
You're Rosario's daughter, aren't you?

26:55.791 --> 26:58.833
I saw my mother cry so many times
because of her.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.666
-Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
-It's okay.

29:21.750 --> 29:24.958
When I was going to bed,
I moved the pillow to one side...

29:26.541 --> 29:28.125
and I found this.

29:28.708 --> 29:29.958
It's for you.

29:33.666 --> 29:35.541
I guess they were right, and...

29:37.166 --> 29:38.791
she killed herself.

29:41.583 --> 29:44.583
It's a place where she used
to go with my mother.

29:45.500 --> 29:46.416
That's all.

30:03.541 --> 30:04.625
<i>"They know.</i>

30:05.208 --> 30:08.833
<i>I told you they'd find out.</i>
<i>No one can protect you from them.</i>

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
<i>Something is devouring my insides.</i>
<i>I feel like it's going to kill me</i>

30:14.333 --> 30:16.833
<i>and it's pointless</i>
<i>to hide this any longer.</i>

30:19.041 --> 30:22.750
<i>It's an old run-down farmhouse</i>
<i>with dirty walls</i>

30:22.916 --> 30:24.416
<i>and a dark roof.</i>

30:25.333 --> 30:27.541
<i>It's on the Orabidea Road,</i>

30:28.125 --> 30:30.333
<i>and though it's invisible from above,</i>

30:30.416 --> 30:33.958
<i>you'll suddenly see it for a moment</i>
<i>when the road curves.</i>

30:36.958 --> 30:38.333
<i>It's a black house,</i>

30:38.916 --> 30:42.375
<i>and I don't mean its color</i>
<i>but what is inside.</i>

30:44.708 --> 30:46.500
<i>If you're who you say you are,</i>

30:46.583 --> 30:50.083
<i>if you survived the fate</i>
<i>they had prepared for you,</i>

30:50.166 --> 30:52.375
<i>it won't matter if you look for them.</i>

30:52.916 --> 30:55.625
<i>Sooner or later, they'll find you.</i>

30:56.000 --> 30:57.583
<i>May God help you."</i>

31:52.208 --> 31:53.791
Hello, can I help you?

31:53.875 --> 31:57.500
Hello. I'm looking for an old house.
It could be the building down there,

31:57.583 --> 32:00.208
-but it's quite new and...
-I know nothing about houses.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.541
Your help is important.

32:04.625 --> 32:07.125
-Are you investigating that scum?
-Yes.

32:07.666 --> 32:10.166
Have you seen
any of these people there?

32:14.625 --> 32:16.625
Yes, I've seen him many times.

32:16.958 --> 32:19.208
I've never seen those two sourpusses.

32:19.750 --> 32:21.333
Could I have your name?

32:21.416 --> 32:22.416
Ana Mari Ezkurra.

32:22.833 --> 32:25.666
-Have you been living here long?
-Ask them about Ainara.

32:25.791 --> 32:28.125
Ainara is the only name that matters.
Hurry!

32:35.291 --> 32:36.291
Wait!

32:42.375 --> 32:43.541
Good morning.

32:45.250 --> 32:48.166
Inspector Salazar,
Homicide Department, Navarre Police.

32:48.250 --> 32:51.041
-Are you the owners of the house?
-Yes, why?

32:51.708 --> 32:53.250
I've got bad news for you.

32:53.625 --> 32:55.916
Your friend Dr. Berasategui is dead.

32:58.333 --> 32:59.625
How did you know him?

32:59.708 --> 33:02.666
Our relationship is protected
by professional secrecy.

33:02.750 --> 33:04.125
If you'll excuse us...

33:04.541 --> 33:06.125
One last thing...

33:07.833 --> 33:11.250
Was Dr. Berasategui ever with this woman?

33:13.708 --> 33:15.000
We've never seen her.

33:17.458 --> 33:19.166
-Anyone else at home?
-Inspector.

33:19.250 --> 33:21.875
You just told us
someone very dear to us died.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.625
We need time to take it in.

33:24.166 --> 33:27.000
If you have questions, talk to our lawyer.

33:33.291 --> 33:36.375
The poor woman died
from swallowing sharp objects,

33:36.541 --> 33:38.791
and I assure you it wasn't willingly.

33:38.916 --> 33:43.416
Someone made her eat walnut shells
until she ruptured inside,

33:43.500 --> 33:44.833
and once she was dead,

33:44.916 --> 33:50.125
<i>they stuffed her with more shells</i>
<i>until her intestines burst.</i>

33:50.541 --> 33:51.625
Thank you, doctor.

33:52.041 --> 33:54.833
-We've got the birth certificate.
-Good!

33:55.000 --> 34:00.500
Ainara Martínez Batón, December 11, 1977.
Daughter of the farmhouse owners.

34:00.583 --> 34:03.625
She was born in the family home,
the farmhouse "Argi Beltz,"

34:03.708 --> 34:06.208
-and the midwife was Fina Hidalgo.
-Jesus!

34:06.541 --> 34:09.291
The death certificate
is nowhere to be found.

34:09.375 --> 34:11.875
-Argi Beltz is "Black Light" in Basque.
-Montes?

34:11.958 --> 34:15.125
<i>We spoke to the families</i>
<i>investigated by Social Services.</i>

34:15.208 --> 34:18.416
<i>When their babies died,</i>
<i>they were very ordinary people,</i>

34:18.500 --> 34:20.500
but now they're all rolling in it.

34:20.583 --> 34:24.333
Pharmaceutical labs,
real estate businesses, a law firm...

34:24.583 --> 34:28.583
-They've all been very lucky in life.
-Understatement of the year.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.041
There was even a lawyer

34:30.125 --> 34:32.833
<i>with terminal cancer</i>
<i>who's now fit as a fiddle.</i>

34:34.333 --> 34:36.666
-The lawyer's name?
<i>-Karmele Andía.</i>

34:36.791 --> 34:39.333
Joint owner
of the Lejarreta and Andía law firm.

35:00.416 --> 35:02.833
Berasategui,
my mother, Elena Ochoa...

35:03.000 --> 35:04.541
What links them is that house.

35:04.666 --> 35:07.083
That group and a couple of wealthy lawyers

35:07.166 --> 35:10.375
from Pamplona,
who I think also lost a daughter.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.541
Find anything alarming
in the Social Services' reports?

35:14.916 --> 35:15.750
No.

35:15.833 --> 35:18.833
Did you establish a direct link
between those families?

35:18.958 --> 35:21.458
No, but it could be a nurse
named Fina Hidalgo,

35:21.541 --> 35:24.583
a midwife who was at all
the births, including my sister's.

35:24.666 --> 35:27.083
And she admitted to killing
newborn babies.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.750
So you're not sure?

35:29.708 --> 35:31.125
I don't have evidence.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.916
Did anyone else hear

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
-when the midwife admitted that?
-No.

35:37.833 --> 35:39.791
Javier, please, I need your help.

35:39.875 --> 35:41.416
I need to get into Argi Beltz,

35:41.916 --> 35:44.333
and I need to see the files
the midwife keeps.

35:44.458 --> 35:47.041
If the death certificates
for those girls turn up,

35:47.166 --> 35:49.375
their bodies
would have to be exhumed.

35:51.791 --> 35:54.750
I'll authorize the search warrant
for the files,

35:55.333 --> 35:57.708
but everything else you're asking,
Amaia...

35:57.833 --> 35:59.083
Please.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.708
It's true that the midwife's attitude
is suspicious,

36:04.041 --> 36:07.958
but you haven't established
a direct link between all those people.

36:08.333 --> 36:11.333
You have to bring me
solid evidence, Amaia.

36:12.750 --> 36:13.625
I will.

36:19.500 --> 36:20.666
Is everything okay?

36:26.458 --> 36:28.708
When I was 12,

36:29.083 --> 36:31.291
my mother got pregnant again.

36:33.333 --> 36:36.166
My parents were ecstatic.
The pregnancy went well

36:36.291 --> 36:38.125
and the baby was born healthy.

36:41.041 --> 36:42.416
But at three weeks,

36:43.166 --> 36:44.458
my baby brother died.

36:46.416 --> 36:51.000
From that day on, my mother
only spoke to ask about her baby.

36:52.041 --> 36:53.916
She went crazy with grief.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.708
She tried to kill herself
and was sent to a clinic.

37:00.625 --> 37:02.500
She died two years later.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.208
I won't open a grave
to unearth all that suffering...

37:14.041 --> 37:17.625
unless you get me a witness
who saw them killing their daughter,

37:18.541 --> 37:21.583
or a coroner's report retracting
his previous report

37:21.666 --> 37:23.416
and submitting new evidence.

37:24.625 --> 37:27.958
Otherwise, I won't authorize
the exhumation of a baby's body.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.333
How'd you get over it?

37:35.083 --> 37:36.500
By forgiving, Amaia.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.583
Forgiving her,

37:40.375 --> 37:41.333
my father,

37:42.291 --> 37:43.541
my baby brother,

37:44.875 --> 37:46.083
and even myself.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.458
You should try it.

38:06.750 --> 38:08.125
What's so funny?

38:08.958 --> 38:11.291
I feel good for having told you.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.750
I've never told anybody.

38:37.958 --> 38:40.208
I can count on the order
for those files?

38:40.625 --> 38:42.083
You'll never quit, huh?

38:44.500 --> 38:45.333
Never.

38:46.041 --> 38:48.541
I'm going to kiss you, Inspector Salazar.

38:58.916 --> 39:01.416
-You shouldn't...
-You shouldn't say that.

40:26.708 --> 40:29.083
Sure you don't want
to add some bits of bread?

40:29.541 --> 40:31.000
I'm sure, Auntie.

40:33.875 --> 40:34.958
Oh, my little girl...

40:54.500 --> 40:55.500
This way.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.458
The patient's records
are in the cabinets,

41:00.583 --> 41:03.000
and the certificates and documents...

41:09.000 --> 41:10.833
-They're gone.
-There's nothing.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Let's go.

41:14.166 --> 41:16.166
What a terrible coincidence!

41:16.250 --> 41:20.125
You came about the papers,
and just yesterday, I decided to clean up.

41:20.208 --> 41:22.541
-And the certificates?
-You came to see them,

41:22.666 --> 41:24.958
so it reminded me
they were gathering dust

41:25.125 --> 41:27.333
-and I threw them out.
-What did you do?

41:27.791 --> 41:30.500
-What you do with useless paper...
-Boss!

41:30.666 --> 41:31.750
I lit a good fire.

41:37.333 --> 41:39.666
All burned,
and the ashes pulverized.

41:48.458 --> 41:50.791
It seems you're not a lucky woman.

41:52.958 --> 41:54.000
Let's go.

41:54.833 --> 41:55.666
Amaia.

41:55.750 --> 41:56.583
Amaia!

42:01.958 --> 42:05.958
I want the names of everyone who knew
we were coming and a list of calls made

42:06.041 --> 42:08.250
from the station,
including private phones.

42:08.333 --> 42:09.541
Are you accusing us?

42:09.625 --> 42:14.166
-Someone's been careless with information.
-This visit wasn't a secret.

42:14.250 --> 42:15.250
I mentioned it.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.291
We weren't visiting a coke plantation.

42:17.375 --> 42:20.583
We were visiting a house
for some papers. Let's not overdo it.

42:21.083 --> 42:23.291
I want the name of who's responsible.

42:28.416 --> 42:31.541
I've shown those photos
to the police many times.

42:32.333 --> 42:34.833
There have always been
very strange people.

42:35.208 --> 42:38.250
About 40 years ago, a couple
used to walk around buck naked.

42:38.666 --> 42:42.250
They had animals and brought
a bunch of people for meetings.

42:43.708 --> 42:47.000
They burned pungent herbs
and sometimes we heard squeals

42:47.666 --> 42:49.500
like it was a slaughterhouse.

42:52.166 --> 42:53.833
Ainara was their daughter.

42:55.958 --> 42:57.583
She was a year and a bit.

42:58.041 --> 43:00.708
They never bothered about her,
they didn't feed her,

43:00.833 --> 43:03.166
and she was always dirty
and on her own.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.166
They didn't feed her?

43:06.291 --> 43:08.458
One day I made doughnuts,
and she smelled them.

43:08.625 --> 43:10.666
She came walking here, ravenous.

43:11.500 --> 43:14.000
There she is.
We gave her doughnuts and milk.

43:14.125 --> 43:16.416
She ate it all so fast,

43:16.875 --> 43:18.666
I thought she was going to choke.

43:19.125 --> 43:23.166
The parents are still the owners,
but they're not hippies anymore.

43:23.541 --> 43:25.875
They're loaded and always have visits

43:25.958 --> 43:28.458
from rich folks with big cars
and even a bodyguard.

43:28.958 --> 43:30.791
Any day now, I'll see the president.

43:31.333 --> 43:32.791
What happened to Ainara?

43:33.083 --> 43:36.083
One night, I brought
some of my daughters' clothes,

43:36.166 --> 43:37.708
and when I got to the house,

43:38.416 --> 43:40.833
I saw a crowd celebrating something.

43:40.916 --> 43:44.833
I asked for Ainara, and they told me
she'd died of a seizure.

43:46.125 --> 43:48.625
The child was dead,
and they were so happy.

43:49.958 --> 43:51.666
They didn't even have a funeral.

43:52.916 --> 43:57.000
They said it happened on a trip
to England, and they buried her there.

44:00.250 --> 44:02.750
Do you remember ever seeing
this woman?

44:03.541 --> 44:05.208
Oh, lots of times.

44:05.916 --> 44:07.416
She still comes.

44:09.625 --> 44:12.583
Thank you so much.
Your statement is going to help.

44:13.250 --> 44:14.500
A bit late...

44:17.125 --> 44:19.250
You be very careful, honey.

44:19.791 --> 44:22.833
You can't kill witches
and the devil with bullets.

44:31.291 --> 44:32.375
Excuse me.

44:34.458 --> 44:35.458
Excuse me!

44:36.083 --> 44:37.416
Just a minute, please.

44:38.250 --> 44:39.583
Hey, please...

44:40.083 --> 44:41.000
Wait!

44:43.500 --> 44:44.333
Hey!

44:46.291 --> 44:47.291
Stop!

44:59.083 --> 45:01.083
-Let go of me, murderer!
-Don't move!

45:01.166 --> 45:02.916
I know my rights! Murderer!

45:03.041 --> 45:04.750
I'm a police officer. I want a word.

45:04.833 --> 45:05.666
Okay?

45:05.750 --> 45:07.625
Why were you taking photos?

45:07.750 --> 45:09.291
Because those people...

45:10.041 --> 45:11.708
killed my daughters.

45:15.125 --> 45:17.208
I didn't want to have children.

45:17.541 --> 45:19.791
It was my husband who wanted them.

45:21.666 --> 45:24.333
But when they were born
and I saw their little faces...

45:26.500 --> 45:29.125
-What's your husband's name?
-He's French.

45:30.708 --> 45:33.625
We're still married, but...

45:34.666 --> 45:38.583
now he lives in our house in Ainhoa
with some slut he found.

45:39.833 --> 45:41.625
What's his name, Yolanda?

45:42.125 --> 45:43.708
Marcel Tremond.

45:44.458 --> 45:46.250
At first, he was so kind to me,

45:46.333 --> 45:49.750
but while I was pregnant,
he met the people from that house

45:49.833 --> 45:51.833
and it all went to hell between us.

45:52.625 --> 45:55.500
-Did he suggest you give birth at home?
-I'll say he did.

45:55.625 --> 45:57.416
"The old way," he said.

45:58.041 --> 46:01.416
But we ruled it out when we learned
that there were twins.

46:02.166 --> 46:03.291
How did they die?

46:04.333 --> 46:06.083
Crib death.

46:06.916 --> 46:08.583
Both of them the same night.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.291
I cried so much,

46:10.375 --> 46:12.583
I thought my throat would tear apart.

46:13.666 --> 46:16.375
I went crazy, I admit it,

46:16.500 --> 46:18.000
over losing them and...

46:21.125 --> 46:23.916
seeing what my husband did
the day of the funeral.

46:24.333 --> 46:25.375
What did he do?

46:25.708 --> 46:27.333
He took the bodies away.

46:27.916 --> 46:29.041
That's what he did.

46:29.416 --> 46:31.958
<i>He said now</i>
<i>everything would go well for us.</i>

46:32.375 --> 46:35.708
<i>He ordered their coffins be closed,</i>
<i>but I opened them</i>

46:36.458 --> 46:39.583
<i>and saw there were only</i>
<i>towels and bags of sugar inside.</i>

46:39.708 --> 46:43.083
<i>I told him I didn't believe</i>
<i>the babies were in their crypt</i>

46:43.166 --> 46:45.041
<i>and I wanted to open it, but...</i>

46:45.375 --> 46:48.875
<i>The Ainhoa crypt belongs to his family,</i>
<i>and he refused.</i>

46:50.416 --> 46:52.208
After that, her husband was never home.

46:52.291 --> 46:55.250
She followed him and saw
he always went to the farmhouse.

46:55.333 --> 46:58.125
Out of curiosity, boss,
how'd you end up there?

46:58.208 --> 46:59.541
Looking for my mother.

47:00.166 --> 47:03.250
Yolanda has memory cards
with photos we have to pick up.

47:03.375 --> 47:04.375
I'll talk to her.

47:04.458 --> 47:07.500
All her husband's companies
are represented by that firm.

47:07.583 --> 47:09.166
-It all fits.
-No.

47:09.291 --> 47:11.625
This is the first case
of siblings who died,

47:11.708 --> 47:13.458
and of boys instead of girls.

47:13.625 --> 47:17.875
The judge could think she's bitter
and wants to get back at her ex.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.333
I know, but right now it's all we have.

47:20.458 --> 47:22.125
Let's get the autopsy reports.

47:22.250 --> 47:25.291
Markina won't approve exhumation
if we don't give him proof.

47:25.375 --> 47:26.333
But, boss...

47:26.416 --> 47:29.708
Ainhoa is in France.
Markina has no jurisdiction there.

47:35.916 --> 47:37.625
Boss... Well, I...

47:39.708 --> 47:43.375
-What?
-We're busting a gut for those girls.

47:43.708 --> 47:44.791
For all of them.

47:45.541 --> 47:48.541
-What are you saying?
-That we're on your side.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.750
We're not a bunch of useless squealers.

47:56.291 --> 47:58.291
{\an8}AINHOA, FRANCE

48:06.791 --> 48:07.666
Okay.

48:07.791 --> 48:11.000
Yolanda's kids died in the same hospital
where they were born,

48:11.083 --> 48:13.500
and from what we've verified,
there was no autopsy.

48:16.041 --> 48:17.250
Proceed.

48:32.916 --> 48:33.875
Hello?

48:34.416 --> 48:35.833
Yes, it's me.

48:37.375 --> 48:38.583
It's me.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.416
Stop! Just a minute.

48:46.833 --> 48:47.916
Okay.

48:49.125 --> 48:50.416
Thanks for the info.

48:51.291 --> 48:54.000
-Anything wrong, Your Honor?
-The judge in charge

48:54.125 --> 48:55.791
refused permission to open them.

48:55.916 --> 48:58.416
That was for another case
which has no link to--

48:58.583 --> 49:00.833
Never! Do you understand that word?

49:00.916 --> 49:02.041
Never call me again.

49:02.125 --> 49:04.541
You will never have my cooperation.
Is that clear?

49:05.375 --> 49:06.958
Put it back in place.

49:08.333 --> 49:09.291
No!

49:09.708 --> 49:11.500
No! My babies!

49:12.791 --> 49:14.458
My babies!

49:19.458 --> 49:21.416
Javier, let me explain, please...

49:39.875 --> 49:41.750
JUDGE MARKINA

50:19.000 --> 50:21.375
You're back so soon. That's great.

50:24.458 --> 50:26.000
Hello, my love.

50:51.625 --> 50:54.291
<i>Clean the river, Amaia.</i>
<i>Wash away the offense.</i>

52:46.791 --> 52:48.916
Iriarte, what's up?

52:50.125 --> 52:54.291
Around midnight, Yolanda Berrueta
blew up her children's grave

52:54.375 --> 52:56.250
to see if they were inside.

52:56.958 --> 53:00.458
Apparently, she found
an old shipment of explosives

53:00.791 --> 53:06.125
in some mines belonging to her family.

53:06.750 --> 53:09.625
She detonated the explosives,
but it didn't work.

53:09.750 --> 53:12.375
She went up
to see what had happened

53:12.458 --> 53:14.166
and it blew up in her face.

53:14.250 --> 53:16.833
Two fingers were blown off.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.625
They found another two stuck
to the crypt across the way.

53:20.875 --> 53:24.000
And she lost one eye.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.458
I'm sorry, but if the judge finds out
that I've spoken to you...

53:30.625 --> 53:33.583
We're leaving now,
thank you so much for everything.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.416
I owe you one.

53:35.625 --> 53:38.958
Despite her wounds,
the woman managed to crawl

53:39.208 --> 53:42.083
to the crypt and look inside.

54:30.833 --> 54:32.500
Your Honor...

54:35.333 --> 54:36.458
I'll be there.

54:39.958 --> 54:42.500
My ex-wife
has always been very delicate.

54:42.625 --> 54:46.125
She was careless during the pregnancy.
She smoked, drank,

54:46.583 --> 54:49.958
took tranquilizers, slimming pills...

54:50.083 --> 54:52.708
The kids were born
with respiratory problems.

54:52.791 --> 54:54.083
She felt very guilty.

54:54.750 --> 54:57.166
She tried to kill herself twice,

54:57.625 --> 55:00.750
and we convinced her to admit herself
to our clinic.

55:00.916 --> 55:03.083
As well as being Yolanda's in-laws,

55:03.250 --> 55:07.708
Lisa is head of Pediatrics
where the children were born and died.

55:07.833 --> 55:11.625
If you have anything
to ask, inspector, this is the time.

55:14.708 --> 55:16.500
Why wasn't there an autopsy?

55:16.625 --> 55:18.291
It's usual in these cases.

55:18.416 --> 55:20.333
Because it wasn't sudden death.

55:20.500 --> 55:24.708
The cause was lung distress,
which was present from birth.

55:24.875 --> 55:27.291
And also she refused point blank.

55:27.750 --> 55:31.083
"You won't cut open my children,"
she said.

55:31.541 --> 55:34.000
Yolanda is on very strong medication

55:34.166 --> 55:38.166
and confuses dates, situations...
She confuses everything.

55:40.583 --> 55:43.750
What ties do you have
to the lawyers Lejarreta and Andía?

55:43.833 --> 55:46.208
They are our advisers and friends.

55:46.625 --> 55:48.916
Did they introduce you
to the Martínez Batóns?

55:49.000 --> 55:51.291
-They did.
-And the nature of the meetings

55:51.375 --> 55:53.458
in their home with Dr. Berasategui?

55:56.208 --> 55:58.500
The doctor ran a support group

55:58.583 --> 56:01.875
for parents who had lost a child.

56:02.166 --> 56:05.958
We were shocked
by the charges against the doctor.

56:06.583 --> 56:09.291
He was always exemplary with us.

56:10.708 --> 56:13.375
Thank you so much. You've been very kind.

56:13.500 --> 56:15.000
May I show you out?

56:40.666 --> 56:43.291
What am I supposed to do with you,
inspector?

56:44.583 --> 56:46.416
I was wrong to go to the judge.

56:46.875 --> 56:48.750
I wanted a new line of investigation.

56:48.875 --> 56:50.541
Why not come to me, Amaia?

56:50.666 --> 56:53.708
-I'm "Amaia" again?
-I give you all you ask for.

56:54.166 --> 56:56.458
Suddenly, you treat like I'm nobody.

57:03.333 --> 57:05.666
How did the search for the files go?

57:05.791 --> 57:07.041
Badly...

57:07.333 --> 57:10.208
Someone warned the nurse.
She burned everything.

57:10.333 --> 57:12.083
Someone at the station?

57:13.166 --> 57:15.333
Be careful if you accuse someone.

57:16.500 --> 57:18.125
You can do a lot of harm.

57:19.666 --> 57:21.666
I'm leaving for a few days, Javier.

57:21.750 --> 57:23.875
I have to attend to a family matter.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.291
I need to get away from everything.

57:26.791 --> 57:27.833
Everything?

57:30.000 --> 57:31.208
The investigation.

57:44.416 --> 57:45.916
To the station or home?

57:47.666 --> 57:49.000
Take me to the church.

58:02.125 --> 58:04.291
Why are you going
to your mother's funeral?

58:05.791 --> 58:07.375
You know she isn't dead.

58:11.708 --> 58:13.208
I know nothing, Jonan.

58:13.291 --> 58:15.875
-Maybe I'm wrong about that, too.
-No.

58:16.541 --> 58:19.500
One thing is screwing up
and another is giving up.

58:19.666 --> 58:21.166
It wasn't a screw-up.

58:21.333 --> 58:24.416
It was a mistake
that almost cost someone their life.

58:24.708 --> 58:26.083
That woman's crazy.

58:26.458 --> 58:28.125
Markina can't pin it on you.

58:28.708 --> 58:30.958
We wouldn't have turned
to the French judge

58:31.041 --> 58:32.458
if he had backed you up.

58:32.541 --> 58:35.875
-I shouldn't have gone over his head.
-This is a mistake.

58:37.416 --> 58:39.208
You're not being objective, boss.

58:39.291 --> 58:42.291
You told me that an investigator
must trust his instinct.

58:42.500 --> 58:45.458
Investigating is making a mistake
and carrying on, persisting,

58:46.000 --> 58:47.416
opening new lines,

58:47.708 --> 58:49.208
fighting like soldiers...

58:49.291 --> 58:50.541
And yet today...

58:51.416 --> 58:53.208
you went against all you taught me.

58:55.208 --> 58:56.708
I can't think, Jonan.

58:59.291 --> 59:01.458
I don't want to make a mistake again.

59:01.916 --> 59:03.500
The coat in the river was a decoy.

59:03.583 --> 59:06.291
We know your mother isn't dead,
whatever they say.

59:06.916 --> 59:09.375
I believe that someone
warned that Hidalgo woman.

59:10.125 --> 59:12.166
-As for the judge...
-What?

59:12.625 --> 59:16.000
-Your personal relationship's blinded you.
-How dare you!

59:20.291 --> 59:21.958
I dare because I care about you.

59:23.625 --> 59:26.291
I'd never let anything personal
affect a case.

59:26.708 --> 59:27.916
Then don't start today.

01:00:07.833 --> 01:00:09.708
Get out of here now!

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:03.333
-Auntie!
-Hi.

01:01:03.416 --> 01:01:06.375
-I thought you'd be at the funeral.
-I almost went.

01:01:07.083 --> 01:01:10.416
But you can't go to the funeral
of someone you don't think is dead.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.916
I'm not a phony, Amaia.

01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:14.000
And anyway,

01:01:14.166 --> 01:01:16.166
I can't pray for her soul.

01:01:16.458 --> 01:01:19.291
She tried to kill Ibai,
and she almost killed me.

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:22.833
One thing is being pious,
another is being a jerk.

01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:32.875
What do you know
about witchcraft in the valley?

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:36.458
A century ago, more people here
believed in witches

01:01:36.541 --> 01:01:38.041
than in the Holy Trinity.

01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:42.000
Think someone
might be summoning those forces now?

01:01:42.458 --> 01:01:43.916
Oh, Lord...

01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:47.750
Ms. Analytical talking
about witchcraft in the 21st century.

01:01:48.833 --> 01:01:51.750
-They're killing babies...
-To make sacrifices,

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:53.708
offerings to evil.

01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:57.041
Minor gods that someone
is trying to awaken.

01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:02.416
Sweetheart...

01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:05.875
Yesterday I saw
something in the cards that scared me.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:06.958
What was it?

01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:10.583
The cards told me that a good friend
of yours is in danger.

01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:13.666
Seems they've come looking for him.

01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:15.083
Aloisius...

01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:59.041
The ceremony was beautiful.

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.500
And there were lots of people.

01:03:01.958 --> 01:03:03.125
The whole town.

01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:07.833
María Rosa told me to give you
her regards. She'd like to meet up soon.

01:03:08.583 --> 01:03:09.875
Okay. Sure.

01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:11.791
Well...

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:14.416
Now we're all together,
I'd like to tell you something…

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.541
if Amaia can put down her phone a minute.

01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:20.750
-I'm expecting something.
-It's just a moment.

01:03:20.833 --> 01:03:23.083
The world will keep turning without you.

01:03:24.625 --> 01:03:27.125
I'm starting
a serious relationship with a man.

01:03:27.208 --> 01:03:29.291
Well, it's more like we resumed it.

01:03:29.625 --> 01:03:33.291
His name is Fermín, and Amaia
knows him well. She works for him.

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:34.208
Montes?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.625
-That's right.
-If he makes you happy, Flora.

01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:38.541
Yes.

01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:42.083
He said you're leaving
for a few days tomorrow.

01:03:43.375 --> 01:03:45.000
Yes, you knew that already.

01:03:45.375 --> 01:03:47.333
Excuse me, I have to make a call.

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:40.458
-Yes?
<i>-Inspector Salazar?</i>

01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:43.958
-Yes.
<i>-I'm Etxaide's mother.</i>

01:04:44.291 --> 01:04:46.916
<i>I'm sorry to call you,</i>
<i>but I'm a bit worried.</i>

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.666
<i>Is my son with you?</i>

01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:51.541
No, Jonan went to Pamplona
this morning.

01:04:51.666 --> 01:04:53.625
I'm in Elizondo. Is something up?

01:04:53.916 --> 01:04:58.208
<i>He arranged to come home for lunch</i>
<i>and hasn't turned up or called me.</i>

01:04:58.291 --> 01:05:00.125
<i>And his cell is switched off--</i>

01:05:00.208 --> 01:05:01.541
Don't worry.

01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:04.541
He must be with a colleague.
I'll call him right away.

01:05:04.625 --> 01:05:06.833
I'll make a few calls and call you back.

01:05:06.916 --> 01:05:09.166
-Don't you worry.
<i>-Thanks a lot, Amaia.</i>

01:05:17.666 --> 01:05:21.625
<i>This is Jonan Etxaide's voicemail.</i>
<i>Please leave your message.</i>

01:05:22.041 --> 01:05:24.708
Jonan, it's Amaia.
Call me as soon as you can, please.

01:05:35.041 --> 01:05:36.333
<i>-Yes, boss?</i>
-Fermín.

01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:40.083
Jonan's mom just called.
He's been missing all day.

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:43.458
<i>I'll call Goñi. He lives near him</i>
<i>and can check it out.</i>

01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:46.208
<i>He's probably asleep</i>
<i>with his phone on silent.</i>

01:05:46.291 --> 01:05:47.458
Yes. Do that, please.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.708
-Is anything wrong?
-I'll be right back.

01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:26.708
-Boss...
-Montes.

01:06:26.833 --> 01:06:30.333
Etxaide was in his house.
Goñi found the door open...

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.833
-And?
-Shit, Amaia...

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.208
He was on the floor. He's been shot.

01:06:35.875 --> 01:06:37.416
God! Let's go...

01:06:37.583 --> 01:06:38.625
My God!

01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:49.625
What did Goñi tell you?

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:52.000
He was going to ring the bell
when he arrived,

01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:56.041
but he saw the door was open,
went in, and found him on the floor.

01:06:56.166 --> 01:06:58.125
How many times
was he shot and where?

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:01.208
I don't know.
He'd just gone in when we talked.

01:07:01.458 --> 01:07:03.458
-Call him.
-I did, and he didn't answer.

01:07:03.625 --> 01:07:05.333
Then keep trying, for fuck's sake!

01:07:20.541 --> 01:07:21.666
He's not picking up.

01:07:32.833 --> 01:07:35.833
-What hospital is he in?
-He's at his apartment.

01:07:37.958 --> 01:07:39.333
At his apartment? Why?

01:07:39.458 --> 01:07:41.708
They're probably stabilizing him.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.083
Stop!

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.750
-Make way!
-Excuse me.

01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:18.916
What's Dr. San Martín doing here?

01:08:33.332 --> 01:08:34.832
-Let me by.
-You shouldn't go in.

01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:36.750
-Let me through!
-Please, don't!

01:08:36.832 --> 01:08:38.125
Please!

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:39.541
Let me go!

01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:43.707
Let me go.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:49.832
No!

01:08:58.457 --> 01:09:00.000
No!

01:09:15.207 --> 01:09:16.082
I'm sorry.

01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:18.707
Don't touch him.

01:09:20.332 --> 01:09:21.500
No!

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:43.125
Forgive me!

01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:46.041
Forgive me!

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.250
No.

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:07.375
If you want someone
to accompany you home...

01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:11.541
If any of you can't bear being here,
you can leave now.

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:13.875
I'm not head of Homicide for nothing.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.208
Won't take them long
to pull us off the case,

01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:20.166
so take photos of everything
before they do.

01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:23.041
-Of course, inspector.
-Sure, boss.

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:22.375
The killer fired subsonic ammo
from an IMI 9mm with a silencer.

01:12:22.791 --> 01:12:25.125
Hence the neighbors heard nothing.

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:27.750
Everything points
to Etxaide knowing the killer.

01:12:28.125 --> 01:12:30.208
He opened the door. Let the killer in.

01:12:30.666 --> 01:12:32.083
They came in together.

01:12:32.541 --> 01:12:34.916
That's why his body was
at the far end of the room.

01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:39.250
And it didn't seem like the usual robbery.
There was nothing overturned,

01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:41.291
and they only took the laptop,

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:44.333
cameras, hard disks and memory cards.

01:12:44.791 --> 01:12:45.708
And the gun.

01:12:45.833 --> 01:12:48.791
For a hit man, a clean weapon
is worth more than money.

01:12:49.375 --> 01:12:52.000
Inspector Clemos
sent us the autopsy report.

01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:53.541
I can't stand that asshole.

01:12:53.625 --> 01:12:57.041
Either he starts writing to us
or I'm going to fucking punch him.

01:12:57.166 --> 01:13:00.416
He took a shot in the chest
and another in the forehead.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:04.000
From the trajectory,
the killer must have been crouching

01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:05.125
or kneeling.

01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:08.708
Hit men never fire a first shot so low.

01:13:09.041 --> 01:13:10.833
The second one could be to make sure,

01:13:10.916 --> 01:13:14.208
but this says the first shot
would have been enough to kill him.

01:13:14.291 --> 01:13:15.625
What are you getting at?

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.750
That the second shot was fired
to spare him suffering.

01:13:19.916 --> 01:13:20.916
Out of pity.

01:13:21.041 --> 01:13:24.333
Come on. Since when do you fire
a head shot out of pity?

01:13:24.458 --> 01:13:27.291
To ensure no more suffering
than necessary.

01:13:27.541 --> 01:13:30.458
And you know
because the killer shot him again?

01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:32.750
Yes...

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.583
And closed Jonan's eyes.

01:13:55.916 --> 01:13:57.333
I'm sorry.

01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:02.333
I'm sorry.

01:14:28.583 --> 01:14:29.875
Inspector...

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:32.500
Thank you for coming.

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:34.416
Call me Amaia, please.

01:14:34.583 --> 01:14:37.000
Jonan admired
and respected you very much.

01:14:37.166 --> 01:14:38.750
And I felt the same about him.

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:00.083
Internal Affairs discovered that Etxaide

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:05.541
regularly accessed your computer remotely
to copy files and mails.

01:15:05.875 --> 01:15:07.250
Of course he did.

01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:09.958
He was my assistant
and had access to everything.

01:15:10.333 --> 01:15:14.000
Yes, but they say
that he accessed your computer

01:15:14.166 --> 01:15:15.916
the day we went
to the midwife's house

01:15:16.041 --> 01:15:18.458
and he could have been the one
who warned her.

01:15:19.041 --> 01:15:20.500
That's impossible.

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:22.458
Montes...

01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:25.708
Is it true he accessed
your PC without authorization?

01:15:25.791 --> 01:15:29.083
He knew all my passwords.
He didn't need authorization.

01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:31.750
Not even to see your personal mail?

01:15:32.125 --> 01:15:36.291
Maybe he did it to install
an antivirus app or something...

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:49.833
Amaia...

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:54.125
I'm Marc.

01:15:55.708 --> 01:15:57.333
Jonan's husband.

01:15:57.833 --> 01:15:58.833
Marc...

01:15:59.916 --> 01:16:02.125
I didn't know Jonan was with someone.

01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:04.208
Don't worry.

01:16:04.791 --> 01:16:07.375
You know he was very reserved
about personal things.

01:16:08.291 --> 01:16:10.083
But he talked about you a lot.

01:16:12.083 --> 01:16:15.083
I'm going to catch the killer, Marc.
I promise.

01:16:16.375 --> 01:16:18.041
That won't bring him back to us.

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:20.583
No.

01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:26.375
He knew, Amaia.

01:16:28.958 --> 01:16:30.625
Jonan knew he was in danger.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.208
Did he say something?

01:16:33.291 --> 01:16:35.750
He felt something might happen.
He left you a message.

01:16:35.833 --> 01:16:38.291
-What message?
-It isn't a message as such.

01:16:38.791 --> 01:16:40.625
But about two weeks ago,

01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:44.125
he told me he had something.
If he couldn't give it to you,

01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:45.375
I should.

01:16:45.458 --> 01:16:47.625
-What did he give you?
-A word.

01:16:48.166 --> 01:16:50.125
He said you'd know how to use it.

01:16:50.208 --> 01:16:51.458
"Offering."

01:16:52.458 --> 01:16:53.958
Offering and his number.

01:16:56.083 --> 01:16:57.375
Is that all?

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.750
He said that he trusted you
more than anyone.

01:16:59.833 --> 01:17:02.166
And that if he couldn't give it to you,

01:17:02.666 --> 01:17:04.333
I should remember…

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:06.708
Offering and his number.

01:17:23.708 --> 01:17:24.833
Amaia.

01:17:26.791 --> 01:17:27.791
Your Honor.

01:17:28.708 --> 01:17:29.916
What are you doing here?

01:17:36.833 --> 01:17:37.958
I'm so sorry.

01:17:41.458 --> 01:17:44.208
-Thank you.
-Would you like to go for a drink?

01:17:44.875 --> 01:17:46.541
I know the perfect place.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.000
Yes.

01:18:00.833 --> 01:18:03.208
Didn't picture you as a whiskey drinker.

01:18:06.125 --> 01:18:08.291
Picture me or any other woman?

01:18:09.583 --> 01:18:12.250
I couldn't picture Inspector Salazar.

01:18:14.375 --> 01:18:15.916
It's got something that…

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:18.166
dulls the pain.

01:18:20.166 --> 01:18:22.333
But it keeps your mind clear.

01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:28.208
I was at an Irish wake once,

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:34.000
and instead of lamenting the loss
of the deceased, what they did was...

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.708
celebrate the life he'd had.

01:18:37.666 --> 01:18:40.333
They told me that,
according to local legends,

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:42.791
wakes last three days

01:18:42.916 --> 01:18:46.125
to make sure that the deceased
isn't feigning his death,

01:18:46.458 --> 01:18:51.166
as no Irish person could resist three
days of partying, whiskey, and friends

01:18:51.333 --> 01:18:53.375
without getting out of the coffin.

01:18:57.875 --> 01:18:58.791
Thank you.

01:18:59.625 --> 01:19:01.125
I never saw Jonan drink.

01:19:02.875 --> 01:19:05.625
I saw him have a beer once.

01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:09.000
But I think it was alcohol-free.

01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:16.750
When I met him, I thought
he was a bit of a know-it-all,

01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:19.583
almost pedantic...

01:19:21.166 --> 01:19:22.875
But later on I realized

01:19:23.916 --> 01:19:26.000
all he wanted was to impress me.

01:19:28.375 --> 01:19:33.250
Later, I saw him questioning
some kids who'd been abused

01:19:33.833 --> 01:19:35.625
and realized he was a master,

01:19:37.666 --> 01:19:40.375
one of those good...

01:19:42.416 --> 01:19:43.375
kind people.

01:19:46.041 --> 01:19:47.958
That same day, I called the chief

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:51.500
and told him, "Don't dare
take him away from me."

01:19:53.041 --> 01:19:54.541
In a few weeks,

01:19:55.125 --> 01:19:57.291
he'd become essential.

01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:02.583
Did you ever tell him?

01:22:50.375 --> 01:22:51.875

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:16.583
Thanks.

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:50.791
Jesus, Jonan!

01:23:51.125 --> 01:23:54.333
Yolanda's father confirmed
that a year before they were born,

01:23:54.416 --> 01:23:57.291
his daughter had a girl named Haizea,
who died of crib death.

01:23:57.375 --> 01:23:59.666
So, Yolanda fell
into depression and dementia.

01:23:59.791 --> 01:24:02.291
The judge won't let us inspect that crypt.

01:24:02.375 --> 01:24:06.125
Pointless, anyway.
The husband ordered the stone replaced.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:07.583
What a bastard!

01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:10.625
All the places of origin
of the dead babies

01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:12.500
border the Baztan River.

01:24:12.666 --> 01:24:16.125
Fina Hidalgo seems to be the link
between all the cases.

01:24:16.208 --> 01:24:20.333
And she worked in Gipuzkoa,
so she likely extended her activity there.

01:24:21.291 --> 01:24:26.208
One. We have to prove the link between her
and the parents of the dead babies

01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:29.291
-so Markina lets us open the graves.
-I'll see to that.

01:24:29.375 --> 01:24:32.666
Two. We have to check all crib deaths
in Navarre and Gipuzkoa,

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:35.833
especially girls whose home towns
border the Baztan River,

01:24:35.958 --> 01:24:38.833
-which up north becomes the Bidasoa.
-I'll deal with that.

01:24:39.166 --> 01:24:43.458
See if the families got richer
after the deaths. We may find a pattern.

01:24:43.833 --> 01:24:46.250
Three. I need a warrant for Argi Beltz,

01:24:46.416 --> 01:24:49.583
but I don't know how, so find a way.

01:24:49.708 --> 01:24:50.541
Got it.

01:24:50.833 --> 01:24:51.708
Good.

01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:54.583
Let's keep open minds,
not rule out anything.

01:24:57.791 --> 01:24:58.916
Excuse me.

01:25:00.541 --> 01:25:01.791
I'd like to...

01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:06.166
apologize for the accusations
the other day.

01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:08.458
That's forgotten, Amaia.

01:25:12.166 --> 01:25:15.958
And also, I'd like to ask you
not to doubt Jonan, please.

01:25:16.875 --> 01:25:21.250
The case was reopened thanks to him,
and he deserves our trust and respect.

01:25:21.708 --> 01:25:23.166
Of course, inspector.

01:25:25.166 --> 01:25:26.416
Get going.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:39.833
Hello?

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:47.958
Marc...

01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:51.500
I'm sorry I called you.

01:25:51.583 --> 01:25:54.625
-I didn't want to bother you.
-It's okay. Don't worry.

01:25:54.708 --> 01:25:57.625
I don't know why I thought someone
would've cleaned it,

01:25:57.708 --> 01:26:01.208
and when I saw it was still there,
I froze and couldn't go in.

01:26:01.291 --> 01:26:02.583
I'll see to everything.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:07.583
Thank you.

01:26:09.333 --> 01:26:12.125
Yes. I'll wait till they arrive,
thank you.

01:27:56.458 --> 01:27:58.375
I'll ask Professor Santos

01:27:59.291 --> 01:28:00.875
if he can analyze it.

01:28:01.625 --> 01:28:05.333
He's an expert in fabric forensics.
We work with him sometimes.

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:18.416
It's very weird. Very weird.

01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:22.125
I'm very sorry
about what happened, Amaia.

01:28:46.625 --> 01:28:48.875
-Everything okay?
-Yes.

01:28:52.333 --> 01:28:54.708
Thought we'd spend the night together.

01:28:56.708 --> 01:28:58.625
I've got a thousand things to do,

01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:01.625
and there's a judge
who keeps asking me for evidence,

01:29:01.833 --> 01:29:03.583
so I have to give it to him.

01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:06.708
You're never going to stop, are you?

01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:10.291
You have to stop, Amaia.

01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:12.541
You're hurting yourself.

01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:15.625
I love you. I want you to stay here,

01:29:15.708 --> 01:29:19.583
but things won't work if you obsess
over ghosts from the past.

01:29:19.666 --> 01:29:22.791
It's not an obsession, Javier.
It's self-preservation.

01:29:22.875 --> 01:29:26.125
-I can't rest while she's out there.
-Rosario is dead.

01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:31.250
I'm not having this conversation,
not with you.

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:33.791
If you really love me,
love me the way I am.

01:29:33.875 --> 01:29:35.666
I'm a searcher. I'm a soldier.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I'll never stop.

01:29:38.125 --> 01:29:38.958
Stay...

01:29:41.416 --> 01:29:42.583
please.

01:29:46.458 --> 01:29:47.333
I've got to go.

01:30:38.375 --> 01:30:42.000
I want you to know I'm your friend,
and I'm here to help you.

01:30:43.583 --> 01:30:48.416
-The death of Etxaide...
-Not death, murder.

01:30:49.333 --> 01:30:52.291
...makes me think you should know
certain details.

01:30:54.791 --> 01:30:56.000
You see,

01:30:56.250 --> 01:31:00.083
Navarre has always been a land
of saints and a pillar of the Church.

01:31:00.166 --> 01:31:02.666
But also,
and perhaps for that same reason,

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:05.583
there has always been evil here.

01:31:06.250 --> 01:31:07.750
We've long been concerned

01:31:07.833 --> 01:31:11.125
about the proliferation of sects
throughout the country.

01:31:12.666 --> 01:31:16.416
Witchcraft and satanic practices
aren't a thing of the past, Amaia.

01:31:17.541 --> 01:31:19.416
Three years ago in Madrid,

01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:22.541
a man confessed that in 1979

01:31:22.625 --> 01:31:26.083
he took part in a human sacrifice
in a farmhouse in Lesaka.

01:31:26.166 --> 01:31:28.833
I know all the open homicide cases
in Navarre.

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:31.750
Not this one.
The judge declared it sealed.

01:31:32.583 --> 01:31:33.833
They find the body?

01:31:34.541 --> 01:31:35.750
Never.

01:31:36.916 --> 01:31:38.291
And the accuser?

01:31:38.708 --> 01:31:40.375
He lives in hiding

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.250
protected by the police and Opus Dei.

01:31:43.333 --> 01:31:44.250
Where?

01:31:47.875 --> 01:31:49.208
Stop just up there.

01:32:15.958 --> 01:32:18.083
Father Sarasola. Inspector Salazar.

01:32:22.125 --> 01:32:23.333
It's here.

01:32:29.625 --> 01:32:31.958
I'd like you to meet Inspector Salazar.

01:32:33.583 --> 01:32:36.916
Some 30 years ago, I met a girl here
at the San Fermín fiestas,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.916
and she invited me to her house
in the mountains, a kind of commune

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.208
where we danced,
drank and took drugs the whole time.

01:32:46.291 --> 01:32:49.083
They had a leader named Xabier Tabese,

01:32:49.458 --> 01:32:52.500
a very special man who talked to us
about magic,

01:32:52.625 --> 01:32:54.708
spiritualism, witchcraft, and...

01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:58.583
what he called
"the return to the origins."

01:32:58.833 --> 01:33:00.000
Is this him?

01:33:00.583 --> 01:33:01.583
No.

01:33:01.875 --> 01:33:03.125
That's me.

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.416
He was very reserved, but...

01:33:05.916 --> 01:33:07.833
I have some photos of the place.

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:10.625
Do you know if Xabier Tabese
was his real name?

01:33:11.166 --> 01:33:14.041
I wasn't thinking about anything
back then.

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:18.625
I was 25, had buddies
with a marijuana farm,

01:33:18.708 --> 01:33:20.291
and a girl crazy about me.

01:33:21.208 --> 01:33:25.166
Tabese told us that if we awoke
the primitive forces with offerings,

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:27.291
we would get whatever we wanted.

01:33:27.666 --> 01:33:30.458
But the more we got,
the more he asked of us.

01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:33.541
And we...

01:33:34.458 --> 01:33:37.958
We worshiped him.
We'd have done anything.

01:33:39.375 --> 01:33:40.416
Sacrifices?

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.250
There always were, yes.

01:33:44.625 --> 01:33:48.250
Animals we offered up
following a ritual he led.

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.125
We held orgies, drank their blood.

01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:53.958
We covered ourselves with it.

01:33:54.458 --> 01:33:58.708
We felt as mighty as gods, and then...

01:34:06.583 --> 01:34:08.375
The parents themselves did it.

01:34:10.916 --> 01:34:14.750
They killed their daughter,
just as Tabese said they should.

01:34:15.875 --> 01:34:17.500
Then he took the body away,

01:34:18.291 --> 01:34:20.666
and after a few days,
the group disappeared.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.708
I never saw anyone again,
but I know we all did well.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.375
In a few years, that group
of deadbeats got rich,

01:34:31.416 --> 01:34:32.708
very rich.

01:34:35.583 --> 01:34:37.208
What happened afterwards?

01:34:38.083 --> 01:34:40.375
Years later, my son got cancer.

01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:44.958
And at the hospital, I recognized
a doctor who'd taken part in all that.

01:34:45.458 --> 01:34:49.208
He suggested making an offering
to save him, a sacrifice.

01:34:50.250 --> 01:34:51.250
I considered it.

01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:56.875
But the voice of God
in my head was stronger.

01:35:06.250 --> 01:35:08.083
My son died a few months later,

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.125
and I decided to report it all.

01:35:12.083 --> 01:35:13.625
My life went to hell.

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:17.208
I lost my wife, my friends, my work...

01:35:18.583 --> 01:35:20.000
I lost everything.

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:25.166
I believe there were more groups
in other places.

01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:29.166
There was another in Baztan
that was going to make a sacrifice soon.

01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:32.666
Apparently, they had a girl
they were feeding just enough,

01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:35.708
waiting to offer her up,
but I don't know any more.

01:35:35.791 --> 01:35:37.750
Do you recall seeing this woman?

01:35:39.125 --> 01:35:41.666
Yes. She was in the Baztan group.

01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:43.875
She was pregnant when we met and was…

01:35:43.958 --> 01:35:45.625
How can I put it? She was...

01:35:46.458 --> 01:35:47.750
quite committed.

01:35:50.708 --> 01:35:51.708
And...

01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:55.500
During the sacrifice...

01:35:56.458 --> 01:35:59.458
Do you recall the procedure
to get what they wanted?

01:36:04.083 --> 01:36:06.500
She was sacrificed to Inguma. To evil.

01:36:06.666 --> 01:36:08.791
It had to be an unbaptized baby girl

01:36:08.875 --> 01:36:11.666
because baptism
is a commitment to another god.

01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:12.916
Why girls?

01:36:13.083 --> 01:36:15.375
Tabese said that when Inguma wakes,

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:18.041
he always takes victims of the same sex,

01:36:18.833 --> 01:36:19.958
and the same age.

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:22.666
What about the bodies?

01:36:22.791 --> 01:36:24.625
They were taken to a magic place.

01:36:24.708 --> 01:36:28.916
According to him, older than Christianity
and where they left the offerings.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.916
-The forest...
-I don't know.

01:36:31.291 --> 01:36:33.125
He took her. That's all I know.

01:36:33.208 --> 01:36:34.833
What did you get in return?

01:36:34.916 --> 01:36:36.333
Whatever we wanted.

01:36:37.666 --> 01:36:39.500
-But...
-There are no "buts."

01:36:39.666 --> 01:36:41.666
We got whatever we wanted.

01:36:45.208 --> 01:36:48.000
What happened to the members
who left the group?

01:36:49.208 --> 01:36:50.500
You don't understand.

01:36:51.458 --> 01:36:53.541
No one can leave the group.

01:36:53.916 --> 01:36:56.458
Sooner or later, Inguma claims his debt.

01:36:56.583 --> 01:36:58.916
We scattered, yes...

01:36:59.458 --> 01:37:02.208
But we never stopped belonging.

01:37:58.541 --> 01:37:59.875
Fuck!

01:38:06.250 --> 01:38:07.750
Shit!

01:38:12.375 --> 01:38:13.708
-Fermín.
<i>-Amaia.</i>

01:38:13.791 --> 01:38:16.750
I've been burglarized.
They've taken my hard disks.

01:38:16.833 --> 01:38:20.625
-They wanted Jonan's files.
<i>-Get the hell out of there right now!</i>

01:38:20.708 --> 01:38:22.916
Yes, I'm leaving now. What did you want?

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.625
<i>Dr. González just called the station</i>
<i>asking for you.</i>

01:38:25.708 --> 01:38:28.916
<i>Dr. Takchenko has had an accident</i>
<i>and she's in the ICU.</i>

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.625
Nadia! What happened?

01:38:30.875 --> 01:38:33.916
<i>Apparently, a car rammed her</i>
<i>and ran her off the road.</i>

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.583
<i>The police told him her car was searched.</i>

01:38:36.666 --> 01:38:39.125
<i>The man was in a terrible state.</i>

01:38:39.666 --> 01:38:40.750
Thank you.

01:38:40.916 --> 01:38:42.500
I'll see you in a minute.

01:38:45.833 --> 01:38:49.291
Can you smell
Auntie's lentils from America?

01:38:49.458 --> 01:38:50.541
Yes!

01:38:54.083 --> 01:38:56.750
All right, James,
I'll tell her you called.

01:38:56.833 --> 01:38:58.875
Take care. Bye.

01:38:59.291 --> 01:39:01.375
Why are you cooking this late?

01:39:03.208 --> 01:39:05.541
Is something going on
that you want to tell me?

01:39:05.625 --> 01:39:06.791
No, nothing.

01:39:08.458 --> 01:39:10.083
Don't you love him anymore?

01:39:10.625 --> 01:39:12.041
Of course I do, Auntie.

01:39:40.916 --> 01:39:42.333
We've found him, boss.

01:39:42.458 --> 01:39:46.125
Xabier Tabese.
Died 11 years ago in a boating accident.

01:39:46.375 --> 01:39:47.666
This is it.

01:39:48.083 --> 01:39:51.000
He appears in various registers
as a "therapist."

01:39:51.291 --> 01:39:53.750
We're still looking for more info on him.

01:39:54.333 --> 01:39:57.041
It seems that the guy was rolling in it.

01:39:57.583 --> 01:39:58.416
Yeah.

01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:05.833
Ask the cemetery manager
which flower shop sends the orchids.

01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:08.291
-Then find out who pays for them.
-Okay.

01:40:16.666 --> 01:40:17.750
Yolanda?

01:40:20.375 --> 01:40:22.250
Don't look like that. I know my rights.

01:40:22.333 --> 01:40:24.583
I can take photos
in a public place if I want!

01:40:24.708 --> 01:40:27.041
-Why are you here?
-I'm following you.

01:40:27.166 --> 01:40:28.958
-Where? Stop.
-Everywhere!

01:40:29.125 --> 01:40:31.541
Please leave. You should be in hospital.

01:40:31.625 --> 01:40:33.291
Have you seen those flowers?

01:40:33.541 --> 01:40:36.541
They look like cribs with babies in them!

01:40:36.666 --> 01:40:38.958
Leave. I don't want to arrest you.

01:40:39.125 --> 01:40:40.458
Isn't that nice?

01:40:40.708 --> 01:40:44.750
My daughter is missing,
and all you care about is your job!

01:40:44.875 --> 01:40:46.125
Let me go!

01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:47.708
I trusted you!

01:40:47.958 --> 01:40:50.291
But deep down, you're all the same.

01:40:50.916 --> 01:40:54.291
My husband's family, the doctors,
the judge, the police...

01:40:54.375 --> 01:40:58.000
-All you care about is yourselves.
-Do you mean Judge Markina?

01:40:58.083 --> 01:41:00.041
He recommended I contact you.

01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:02.625
He said you were a great officer.
The best.

01:41:03.166 --> 01:41:06.333
You'd pull off the investigation
if at all possible.

01:41:06.416 --> 01:41:08.458
Our meeting wasn't by chance?

01:41:08.541 --> 01:41:11.250
He told me never to tell you,
but I don't care.

01:41:11.666 --> 01:41:14.458
Thank you, inspector!
Thank you so much!

01:41:16.291 --> 01:41:19.375
-You shouldn't drive in your state.
-Screw you!

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:31.333
I took pity on her. I'm sorry.

01:41:31.416 --> 01:41:33.708
She called the office a thousand times,

01:41:33.791 --> 01:41:36.875
so I told her that if you
got interested in her case,

01:41:36.958 --> 01:41:38.250
perhaps you could help.

01:41:38.333 --> 01:41:42.750
<i>I just gave advice to someone desperate</i>
<i>who was suffering terribly.</i>

01:41:43.166 --> 01:41:44.833
-You tricked me.
<i>-No.</i>

01:41:44.958 --> 01:41:48.458
I didn't want her to introduce herself,
saying I'd sent her.

01:41:48.583 --> 01:41:50.916
You don't let me open graves
but send Yolanda.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.416
You refused my warrant request.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:55.375
You say I'm obsessed
with a case but push me towards it.

01:41:55.458 --> 01:41:57.000
<i>What is your game, Javier?</i>

01:41:57.083 --> 01:41:58.708
It's not a game.

01:41:59.083 --> 01:42:01.000
All I'm doing is protecting you,

01:42:01.083 --> 01:42:04.083
<i>-but as a judge, I have certain limits.</i>
<i>-</i> Protect me?

01:42:04.166 --> 01:42:07.416
Yes, this is how I protect you,
and this is how I defend you.

01:42:08.250 --> 01:42:09.958
But I don't break the rules.

01:42:11.916 --> 01:42:13.333
<i>I know what you're like.</i>

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:14.500
<i>You're brilliant,</i>

01:42:14.625 --> 01:42:18.083
but I can't follow you, because I have to
protect you from yourself

01:42:18.166 --> 01:42:19.500
and from your fears.

01:42:19.916 --> 01:42:23.041
<i>Come to the house tonight</i>
<i>and we'll talk over a bottle of wine.</i>

01:42:23.125 --> 01:42:25.666
I can't. I promised my aunt
I'd have dinner.

01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:27.208
-I have to go.
<i>-Elizondo?</i>

01:42:27.291 --> 01:42:28.541
Yes. I have to go.

01:42:30.958 --> 01:42:34.166
The owner says
they change the orchids each week

01:42:34.291 --> 01:42:35.708
and payment is in cash.

01:42:35.833 --> 01:42:39.166
But it's always a different person
who makes the payment.

01:42:39.916 --> 01:42:42.000
-Are you okay?
-Yes, let's go.

01:42:42.125 --> 01:42:44.250
-See you at the station.
-Yes.

01:42:44.375 --> 01:42:45.791
Boss, I've got news.

01:42:45.875 --> 01:42:48.458
-Go on.
-We ruled out all the baptized girls.

01:42:48.541 --> 01:42:51.375
Five cases
have all the same characteristics.

01:42:51.958 --> 01:42:55.500
If they're separated, we just need
one to authorize the opening.

01:42:55.583 --> 01:42:59.250
-Good work.
-I'm waiting for two confirmations.

01:43:02.250 --> 01:43:04.875
-What's wrong?
-Clemos closed the case on Etxaide.

01:43:05.125 --> 01:43:06.000
What?

01:43:06.083 --> 01:43:08.750
Says it was a drug trafficking thing.
East European mafia.

01:43:08.833 --> 01:43:10.625
That idiot has no evidence.

01:43:10.708 --> 01:43:12.750
He said that it'll turn up.

01:43:12.833 --> 01:43:14.708
-What's he mean by that?
-Okay.

01:43:14.791 --> 01:43:15.666
Boss.

01:43:15.791 --> 01:43:17.833
A man out there is asking for you.

01:43:20.250 --> 01:43:24.083
Yesterday I received the sample
and a note from the doctor,

01:43:24.166 --> 01:43:28.166
asking me to analyze it ASAP
and only give the results to you.

01:43:30.166 --> 01:43:33.166
The fiber is very high-quality silk.

01:43:33.291 --> 01:43:35.791
Judging by
the manufacturer's signature,

01:43:35.916 --> 01:43:38.375
I'd say it was made in England.

01:43:38.958 --> 01:43:41.666
However, it's impossible to be 100% sure,

01:43:41.833 --> 01:43:44.666
-because the shot damaged it.
-The shot?

01:43:44.791 --> 01:43:45.833
Yes.

01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:47.500
Look.

01:43:48.041 --> 01:43:50.250
What you see here is a scorch mark.

01:43:50.333 --> 01:43:53.750
A shot went through the material,
ripping a piece out.

01:43:54.416 --> 01:43:56.791
It's likely that the subject

01:43:57.333 --> 01:43:59.041
hid the weapon in his pocket,

01:43:59.125 --> 01:44:02.041
and the shot went through the material.

01:44:02.958 --> 01:44:06.375
We knew it was a low shot,
but we assumed he was crouching.

01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:08.416
Well, there's the answer, inspector.

01:44:08.916 --> 01:44:10.250
No doubt about it.

01:44:18.791 --> 01:44:22.125
JUDGE MARKINA

01:44:37.208 --> 01:44:38.416
Hello?

01:44:44.833 --> 01:44:45.875
Hello?

01:44:49.083 --> 01:44:50.083
Yolanda?

01:44:55.916 --> 01:44:56.958
Yolanda!

01:46:21.875 --> 01:46:23.125
Help!

01:46:27.708 --> 01:46:29.041
Help!

01:46:51.166 --> 01:46:54.875
Dr. San Martín will let you know
when he's finished the autopsy.

01:46:54.958 --> 01:46:56.125
Thank you.

01:46:56.916 --> 01:47:00.166
Iriarte and Goñi are on their way
to open a grave.

01:47:00.583 --> 01:47:02.833
Later they're opening another in Irun.

01:47:03.125 --> 01:47:05.125
Meanwhile, I'm still after Tabese.

01:47:06.958 --> 01:47:09.666
I've spoken to your sister Flora,

01:47:10.833 --> 01:47:12.166
and I've told her.

01:47:13.208 --> 01:47:14.250
Thank you.

01:47:17.125 --> 01:47:19.125
Wolves don't commit suicide, Fermín.

01:47:19.875 --> 01:47:21.750
You have to kill them.

01:47:23.625 --> 01:47:24.791
You hunt them,

01:47:25.958 --> 01:47:28.666
corner them, and confront them.
You win or die.

01:47:29.791 --> 01:47:31.875
But they never jump off cliffs.

01:47:33.458 --> 01:47:35.958
Rosario cried too. She didn't want to die.

01:47:38.041 --> 01:47:39.666
It's all a bunch of lies.

01:47:42.666 --> 01:47:46.208
All Jonan's files do
is point at all those lies around us.

01:47:47.166 --> 01:47:49.375
The grave of Yolanda's children was a lie.

01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:52.083
Berasategui in disguise was another lie.

01:47:52.208 --> 01:47:55.333
Why did Etxaide have a file
on the Basajaun case?

01:47:55.916 --> 01:47:57.375
I don't know yet.

01:47:57.666 --> 01:47:59.625
But all this is a bunch of lies.

01:47:59.791 --> 01:48:01.958
That's what Jonan tried to show us.

01:48:04.333 --> 01:48:05.541
Iriarte.

01:48:06.458 --> 01:48:07.875
Yes, Iriarte?

01:48:11.666 --> 01:48:12.666
Yes, open it.

01:48:21.041 --> 01:48:22.375
Proceed.

01:48:32.250 --> 01:48:33.958
Overall, she was hydrated.

01:48:34.083 --> 01:48:36.291
Organ perfusion was good.

01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:38.416
Circulation to the limbs normal.

01:48:38.541 --> 01:48:40.375
The skin was in good condition.

01:48:40.541 --> 01:48:42.833
Her nails were manicured,
her hair was cut...

01:48:42.958 --> 01:48:44.875
She appeared healthy.

01:48:46.083 --> 01:48:51.125
She had no lesions that might indicate
exposure to harsh weather.

01:48:51.583 --> 01:48:54.375
I would rule out that she had been
in the river.

01:48:54.458 --> 01:48:55.541
Thank you, doctor.

01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:58.791
Inspector.

01:49:02.083 --> 01:49:05.375
You've been looking for your mother
for too long.

01:49:06.041 --> 01:49:08.000
You've turned her
into something unreal,

01:49:09.125 --> 01:49:10.541
a nightmare...

01:49:11.333 --> 01:49:14.416
Amaia, don't let her become a ghost.

01:49:18.166 --> 01:49:20.041
She's just an old woman, Amaia.

01:50:25.083 --> 01:50:26.041
Where are you?

01:50:30.541 --> 01:50:31.916
You must be happy.

01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:34.833
It turns out that you were right.

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:39.958
Why do you leave walnuts
on Anne Arbizu's grave?

01:50:41.666 --> 01:50:43.958
You shouldn't have touched it.
It's for her.

01:50:44.041 --> 01:50:45.750
I'm sick of lies, Flora.

01:50:46.166 --> 01:50:49.333
Of secrets and fears.
I'm sick of them, goddamn it.

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.791
I want to hear you tell me the truth.

01:50:57.291 --> 01:50:58.958
Anne Arbizu was my daughter.

01:51:01.166 --> 01:51:02.000
What?

01:51:02.833 --> 01:51:06.916
The father was a livestock dealer
I met at a fair and had a fling with.

01:51:07.583 --> 01:51:08.458
That was it.

01:51:10.416 --> 01:51:13.416
When Mom found out,
she said it was best to hide it.

01:51:16.291 --> 01:51:19.208
When I had the baby, we'd give it up.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.666
Then it all would work out.

01:51:22.041 --> 01:51:23.166
Did she say that?

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:25.166
Did she say "give it up"?

01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:30.666
She introduced me to a midwife
who'd take care of it all.

01:51:31.333 --> 01:51:34.833
But I didn't trust that witch,
so I moved to Pamplona.

01:51:36.125 --> 01:51:37.708
And when I gave birth,

01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:40.458
I had my little girl adopted.

01:51:42.458 --> 01:51:43.958
Mom never forgave me.

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.916
-Was the midwife Fina Hidalgo?
-Yes.

01:51:49.416 --> 01:51:50.375
One day...

01:51:51.666 --> 01:51:54.041
I saw my child
in the square in Elizondo.

01:51:57.166 --> 01:51:59.458
I recognized her right away, Amaia.

01:52:02.250 --> 01:52:03.958
The Arbizus had adopted her.

01:52:05.166 --> 01:52:08.666
Ever since, I've lived chained
to this town just to be near her.

01:52:14.333 --> 01:52:15.791
Two years ago...

01:52:16.583 --> 01:52:18.333
Anne turned up at the bakery.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.333
She found out I was her mom
and wanted to get to know me.

01:52:22.916 --> 01:52:24.791
She never blamed me for anything.

01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:29.375
Those were the happiest
two years of my life.

01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:34.041
Till Víctor killed her.

01:52:37.333 --> 01:52:39.250
You killed him because he killed Anne?

01:52:40.083 --> 01:52:43.375
But you knew about him?
That he was killing girls?

01:52:43.458 --> 01:52:46.541
No, I wasn't sure
until I went to see him that night.

01:52:46.625 --> 01:52:49.083
You had a weapon.
You must have suspected.

01:52:49.166 --> 01:52:51.916
You could've prevented it.
Done something.

01:52:59.583 --> 01:53:00.750
Look...

01:53:06.333 --> 01:53:08.958
This is Anne when she was a baby.

01:53:10.541 --> 01:53:13.833
Each time I see Ibai, it breaks my heart.
They're identical.

01:53:16.041 --> 01:53:19.708
I never thought Víctor was responsible
for the crimes till Anne died.

01:53:20.291 --> 01:53:21.166
Why?

01:53:21.250 --> 01:53:24.208
Because of the reasons
he chose his victims.

01:53:24.333 --> 01:53:28.416
-The reasons? What do you mean?
-Think of what he did with the bodies.

01:53:30.708 --> 01:53:32.458
He drowned them. He shaved them.

01:53:32.541 --> 01:53:35.500
He turned them into little girls
and left them in the river.

01:53:35.583 --> 01:53:36.625
Don't you see?

01:53:36.750 --> 01:53:40.416
Mom told Víctor who Anne was
so he'd finish what she couldn't,

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.916
like she did with our sister, with you...

01:53:43.375 --> 01:53:44.208
Or with Ibai.

01:53:44.666 --> 01:53:47.166
I don't know why
he chose the other girls.

01:53:48.125 --> 01:53:50.583
But he killed my daughter
because I didn't give her up.

01:53:52.208 --> 01:53:53.958
They were failed offerings.

01:53:54.375 --> 01:53:56.000
Víctor was giving them up.

01:53:56.166 --> 01:54:00.250
They used Víctor's obsessions.
That's how sects work. You know that.

01:54:01.166 --> 01:54:03.958
They use damaged goods like you and me.

01:54:07.291 --> 01:54:08.500
Why leave walnuts?

01:54:13.583 --> 01:54:17.875
Anne said they symbolize the power
women wielded for centuries in Baztan.

01:54:19.791 --> 01:54:22.000
She said that energy
doesn't end with death,

01:54:22.375 --> 01:54:24.708
and now it's the only thing uniting us.

01:54:39.291 --> 01:54:42.541
I'm so sorry for all
we've had to endure over the years.

01:55:11.958 --> 01:55:13.083
Good evening, boss.

01:55:13.541 --> 01:55:15.458
The two coffins were empty.

01:55:19.833 --> 01:55:22.875
The Basajaun's crimes
were failed offerings.

01:55:23.708 --> 01:55:25.791
Offerings that never came to be.

01:55:26.166 --> 01:55:27.875
But where are the other kids?

01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:30.083
Fucking hell!

01:55:30.375 --> 01:55:31.375
What is it?

01:55:32.333 --> 01:55:34.041
Between the '70s and '90s,

01:55:34.125 --> 01:55:37.541
there was a clinic in Las Rozas
called the "Tabese Clinic."

01:55:38.166 --> 01:55:41.250
It became very prestigious
due to new treatments

01:55:41.333 --> 01:55:43.250
that they brought from the U.S.

01:55:43.583 --> 01:55:47.208
The director took the name
of the clinic to practice medicine.

01:55:47.291 --> 01:55:50.208
His real name was Xabier Markina.

01:55:52.333 --> 01:55:54.166
Judge Markina's father.

01:56:01.333 --> 01:56:04.166
He abandoned us
when my mother lost her mind.

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:09.375
He left a fund for my expenses
and studies, then went away.

01:56:09.458 --> 01:56:12.916
You never looked for him
or wanted to know what he was doing?

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.500
I could imagine.

01:56:15.375 --> 01:56:17.791
Going from one woman to another,

01:56:17.875 --> 01:56:20.666
living like a millionaire,
traveling and sailing

01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:22.833
on the yacht he ended up dying on.

01:56:23.625 --> 01:56:27.541
He combined his work with running
groups in Lesaka and Baztan.

01:56:28.041 --> 01:56:31.916
He introduced them to occult practices.
A witness identified him.

01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:35.625
The witness reported
that they made human sacrifices.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.666
-My father?
-Yes.

01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:42.458
Another witness confirms
the link between the Basajaun's crimes

01:56:42.541 --> 01:56:44.500
and Dr. Berasategui's therapies.

01:56:51.250 --> 01:56:52.791
You've done your homework.

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:54.541
It's my job.

01:56:54.958 --> 01:56:56.708
And now what do you want me to do?

01:56:57.250 --> 01:56:59.541
-What?
-Don't speak to me like that.

01:57:00.041 --> 01:57:02.708
I can't tell you what to do.
I'm a police officer.

01:57:02.791 --> 01:57:05.625
I'm giving you facts.
It's what you asked me for.

01:57:06.291 --> 01:57:08.666
I gave my word
I wouldn't go over your head again.

01:57:11.458 --> 01:57:12.750
I'm sorry.

01:57:16.166 --> 01:57:17.458
Forgive me.

01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:20.916
This isn't easy.

01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:24.833
Never thought
my career would end like this.

01:57:24.916 --> 01:57:27.250
You're not responsible for what he did.

01:57:28.875 --> 01:57:33.041
What future does a judge have
when his father led a satanic sect?

01:57:33.666 --> 01:57:36.958
Even if it's never proved,
the suspicion alone would destroy me.

01:57:37.875 --> 01:57:39.541
This needn't affect you.

01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:43.000
Let me help you.

01:57:45.166 --> 01:57:46.208
You can't.

01:57:46.333 --> 01:57:47.208
Yes, I can.

01:59:34.916 --> 01:59:35.875
Here.

01:59:39.250 --> 01:59:42.583
It's the search warrant
so you can get into Argi Beltz.

01:59:50.458 --> 01:59:51.916
I love you, Amaia,

01:59:52.541 --> 01:59:55.916
like I've never loved anyone.
I couldn't bear to lose you.

02:00:11.458 --> 02:00:14.208
<i>I'll tell Iriarte and Goñi,</i>
<i>we'll head for the farmhouse.</i>

02:00:14.375 --> 02:00:16.833
Okay. I have to hang up. I've got a call.

02:00:17.625 --> 02:00:18.916
-Yes?
<i>-Inspector?</i>

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.458
<i>Benigno, Yolanda's father.</i>

02:00:20.541 --> 02:00:22.916
-Yes, what is it?
<i>-My daughter just left.</i>

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.875
<i>She's going somewhere she found</i>
<i>thanks to you to put an end to all this.</i>

02:00:26.958 --> 02:00:29.041
-Anything else?
<i>-She was very upset,</i>

02:00:29.125 --> 02:00:32.458
<i>and the police said</i>
<i>she hasn't used all the explosives.</i>

02:00:32.541 --> 02:00:35.791
<i>-I don't know what she might do.</i>
<i>-</i> Don't worry. I'll see to it.

02:00:35.875 --> 02:00:36.875
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:01:07.291 --> 02:01:08.208
Fuck!

02:01:31.625 --> 02:01:32.625
Police! Open up!

02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:41.166
Police! Open the door!

02:01:42.208 --> 02:01:43.333
It's us, Fermín!

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.958
-God! Where's Salazar with the order?
-On her way.

02:01:47.458 --> 02:01:50.458
-But she sent it to me.
-So technically, we have it.

02:01:50.541 --> 02:01:53.916
We can't let the same thing happen
like at the midwife's house.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:54.875
Step back.

02:02:11.291 --> 02:02:12.250
Got your back.

02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:18.458
Yolanda! Stop!

02:03:18.708 --> 02:03:20.208
Stop!

02:03:20.333 --> 02:03:23.458
My baby's in there.
I'm going in, whatever it takes!

02:03:24.208 --> 02:03:26.458
Stop it! I said stop it now!

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.541
What the hell...?

02:03:46.791 --> 02:03:49.541
This must be
where the old woman was hiding.

02:03:54.250 --> 02:03:55.291
Is this all?

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:56.916
And Amaia?

02:03:59.083 --> 02:04:01.583
Don't move!
Calm down and drop the crowbar.

02:04:01.666 --> 02:04:03.208
No fucking way!

02:04:03.625 --> 02:04:06.625
My daughter is in there.
Nothing's going to stop me!

02:04:08.125 --> 02:04:09.583
I'm going in!

02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:11.625
One way or another!

02:04:14.833 --> 02:04:15.916
Don't move!

02:04:19.916 --> 02:04:21.333
I must go in there!

02:04:22.041 --> 02:04:24.625
Even if it's over your dead body!

02:04:32.708 --> 02:04:33.541
Are you okay?

02:04:35.583 --> 02:04:37.666
-You killed her!
-She was attacking you.

02:04:38.541 --> 02:04:39.708
She would've killed you.

02:04:45.250 --> 02:04:46.416
They're here...

02:04:47.458 --> 02:04:49.375
They're here, aren't they?

02:04:49.666 --> 02:04:51.750
-They're here.
-Don't go in there.

02:04:52.791 --> 02:04:55.000
Amaia!

02:04:56.041 --> 02:04:57.375
Don't go in there.

02:04:57.958 --> 02:04:59.250
You'll shoot me?

02:04:59.916 --> 02:05:03.125
Do it, because I'm going in
if it's the last thing I do.

02:05:03.208 --> 02:05:05.625
I'll tell you whatever you want,
but don't go in.

02:05:05.708 --> 02:05:07.166
Please. Please!

02:05:08.166 --> 02:05:09.166
Why?

02:05:09.708 --> 02:05:12.125
-Why didn't you stop it?
-I can't stop it.

02:05:13.208 --> 02:05:15.541
I've tried, but it's impossible.

02:05:15.666 --> 02:05:16.583
Liar!

02:05:17.166 --> 02:05:18.333
At first...

02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:21.041
I didn't understand my father.

02:05:21.125 --> 02:05:24.750
But over time, I realized
this is bigger than I thought.

02:05:24.916 --> 02:05:26.583
You said it yourself.

02:05:26.833 --> 02:05:29.958
You've felt that this is bigger than life.

02:05:30.375 --> 02:05:31.750
It works.

02:05:31.833 --> 02:05:34.208
-It's powerful.
-You killed Berasategui.

02:05:35.583 --> 02:05:36.958
He threatened you.

02:05:37.083 --> 02:05:39.791
-You were petrified when you called.
-And my mother.

02:05:39.916 --> 02:05:41.083
You killed Rosario.

02:05:41.166 --> 02:05:43.916
You said you wouldn't rest
while she was alive.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:44.875
You wanted it!

02:05:52.166 --> 02:05:53.250
Don't go in there.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.875
Amaia, don't look in there!

02:06:53.458 --> 02:06:55.208
You are part of this.

02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:58.333
I'm just the channel.

02:06:59.333 --> 02:07:03.250
The thread that links us
to a religion as ancient as the world.

02:07:03.625 --> 02:07:08.666
It has roots in your valley.
A power such as you've never imagined

02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:11.333
and that must be fed.

02:07:12.208 --> 02:07:14.166
That's what you think you're doing?

02:07:15.125 --> 02:07:17.416
Feeding a power by killing little girls?

02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:19.291
The price is high,

02:07:19.416 --> 02:07:21.416
but the reward is extraordinary.

02:07:23.333 --> 02:07:27.791
It's the real way of communing
with the living forces, don't you see?

02:07:27.916 --> 02:07:29.375
You're insane.

02:07:30.125 --> 02:07:31.208
No...

02:07:31.583 --> 02:07:33.708
Don't treat me like that.

02:07:34.583 --> 02:07:35.625
Not you.

02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:37.458
My mom killed her own daughter.

02:07:37.541 --> 02:07:40.083
She tried to kill me
and tried to kill Ibai.

02:07:40.166 --> 02:07:43.000
What goddamn living forces
are you talking about?

02:07:48.208 --> 02:07:50.333
Your mother was obsessed,

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.791
but that's been taken care of.

02:07:53.291 --> 02:07:56.666
I promise that from now on,
no one will hurt you or Ibai.

02:07:57.833 --> 02:07:59.375
Why did you do this to me?

02:07:59.750 --> 02:08:01.708
Why did you get close to me? Why?

02:08:02.166 --> 02:08:05.083
I didn't plan to fall in love with you,
but I did.

02:08:06.125 --> 02:08:10.458
It's hard for you to take in what you see,
but you were made for me. I know.

02:08:10.541 --> 02:08:13.375
-You belong to me as I belong to you.
-No.

02:08:17.166 --> 02:08:18.833
All those deaths...

02:08:20.458 --> 02:08:22.000
The girls from the river,

02:08:22.458 --> 02:08:23.750
Nadia...

02:08:24.750 --> 02:08:26.291
Elena Ochoa...

02:08:26.583 --> 02:08:28.125
Flora's daughter...

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:29.958
My sister!

02:08:30.875 --> 02:08:35.541
-How many deaths are on your hands?
-None, Amaia. None!

02:08:36.875 --> 02:08:39.041
Each person controls their own life.

02:08:39.125 --> 02:08:41.000
And I'm responsible for yours.

02:08:43.791 --> 02:08:46.208
I love you and can't let anyone harm you.

02:08:48.708 --> 02:08:50.708
Your mother would have killed you.

02:08:51.125 --> 02:08:53.666
You can't blame me
for having protected you.

02:08:57.208 --> 02:08:59.500
What power do you have over those people?

02:09:15.375 --> 02:09:16.875
Did you kill Jonan?

02:09:17.791 --> 02:09:18.958
Don't ask me that.

02:09:29.125 --> 02:09:30.583
I had to do it...

02:09:31.875 --> 02:09:34.000
just as I have to do this now.

02:09:36.291 --> 02:09:37.458
I'm sorry.

02:09:38.791 --> 02:09:39.958
I love you, but...

02:09:42.083 --> 02:09:43.250
I have to.

02:10:32.125 --> 02:10:33.583
He had Jonan's gun.

02:10:37.416 --> 02:10:39.416
We just opened Tabese's grave.

02:10:40.791 --> 02:10:42.000
It's empty.

02:10:42.208 --> 02:10:45.166
We'll issue
an international arrest warrant.

02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:46.291
All right.

02:11:20.916 --> 02:11:22.000
Hello?

02:11:34.708 --> 02:11:35.750
All right.

02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:33.166
<i>The town of Hondarribia in Gipuzkoa</i>
<i>was rocked last night</i>

02:12:33.250 --> 02:12:35.916
<i>by the death of two people</i>
<i>in its local cemetery.</i>

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.666
<i>The victims' identities</i>
<i>are currently unknown.</i>

02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:41.833
<i>Little information has been released</i>
<i>about what happened,</i>

02:12:41.916 --> 02:12:45.125
<i>but everything points to one</i>

02:12:45.208 --> 02:12:48.125
<i>the well-known judge from Navarre,</i>
<i>Javier Markina.</i>

02:12:48.250 --> 02:12:50.750
<i>The latest speculation indicates his death</i>

02:12:50.833 --> 02:12:54.083
<i>could be related to some of the cases</i>
<i>he was investigating,</i>

02:12:54.166 --> 02:12:56.833
<i>many of which</i>

02:13:10.416 --> 02:13:11.416
There, there…

02:15:09.666 --> 02:15:13.666
THE BAZTAN TRILOGY
