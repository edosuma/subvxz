WEBVTT

00:09.260 --> 00:11.939
Time!
All right, Klingons, pencils down.

00:14.738 --> 00:15.740
Okay, I have:

00:16.270 --> 00:17.453
- Have it.
- Got it.

00:18.807 --> 00:19.824
Have it.

00:20.810 --> 00:22.117
- Have it.
- Got it.

00:22.615 --> 00:23.988
- I have...
- Got it.

00:25.219 --> 00:26.304
And "kreplach."

00:26.983 --> 00:28.407
Hold on a second. "Kreplach?"

00:29.611 --> 00:32.494
It isn't Klingon;
it's Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.

00:33.021 --> 00:35.456
Well, as it turns out,
it's also a Klingon word.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.915
Really? Define it.

00:37.363 --> 00:40.546
"Kreplach":
A hearty Klingon... dumpling.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.425
- Judge's ruling?
- <i>Bilurrrbe.</i>

00:46.839 --> 00:48.574
Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.

00:48.694 --> 00:51.104
- What's wrong with your TV?
- I don't know. It just died.

00:51.224 --> 00:54.102
- I'm getting a bunch of static.
- Did you pay your cable bill?

00:54.498 --> 00:56.742
You sound just
like the cable company.

00:57.197 --> 00:59.155
All right, shh!
Tyra Banks is about to kick

00:59.275 --> 01:01.222
someone off
America's Next Top Model.

01:01.587 --> 01:03.567
- Excuse me, but we're...
- Don't tell her.

01:03.727 --> 01:05.309
... playing Klingon Boggle.

01:06.935 --> 01:09.895
What do you mean, "Aw"?
Like she didn't know we were nerds?

01:10.147 --> 01:11.495
All right, if you must watch,

01:11.615 --> 01:13.619
then mute it
with closed captions, please.

01:13.911 --> 01:14.911
Fine.

01:18.556 --> 01:21.017
All right, Boggle warriors...

01:29.874 --> 01:31.465
Look at those women.

01:32.656 --> 01:33.722
They're gorgeous.

01:35.092 --> 01:37.177
Nice!
Too bad that's a proper noun.

01:38.781 --> 01:41.095
Look, there's
the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

01:42.156 --> 01:44.549
No, wait, that's
the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.144
With her head in the lap of...

01:46.264 --> 01:49.037
What a coincidence.
It's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

01:50.034 --> 01:52.533
Yeah, and they can all move in
with you and your mother.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.508
The current Mrs. Wolowitz.

01:59.190 --> 02:02.495
Is "..." spelled
with a "..." or a "..."?

02:04.257 --> 02:06.602
Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?

02:07.165 --> 02:10.038
That's Anais. None of the other girls
in the house like her.

02:10.157 --> 02:11.548
House? What house?

02:12.845 --> 02:15.764
- They all live in a house together.
- A house, where?

02:16.532 --> 02:18.457
I don't know.
Somewhere in L.A.

02:19.018 --> 02:20.140
Wait a minute.

02:24.286 --> 02:26.709
You're telling me
that I'm within driving distance

02:26.829 --> 02:29.798
of a house filled
with aspiring supermodels?

02:31.600 --> 02:32.600
Yeah, I guess.

02:33.598 --> 02:36.314
And they live together
and shower together and...

02:38.661 --> 02:40.294
have naked pillow fights?

02:43.657 --> 02:46.267
- Where are you going?
- To pay my cable bill.

02:48.475 --> 02:50.130
All right, pencils down!

02:51.226 --> 02:52.238
I have...

02:54.128 --> 02:56.096
and...
Anybody got those?

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:17.346 --> 03:18.702
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

03:28.080 --> 03:30.687
Did I miss anything?
Did they kick Giselle off?

03:31.321 --> 03:34.582
Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot
was an embarrassment.

03:36.088 --> 03:38.893
Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz
is sensitive to chlorine.

03:40.896 --> 03:44.337
Lucky for her I like my fashion models
pruny and bug-eyed.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.665
Sheldon, the food's here.

03:47.785 --> 03:50.381
There's the house.
Freeze frame, freeze frame.

03:56.429 --> 03:57.531
What are you doing?

03:57.651 --> 03:59.802
Marking the star positions
and physical landmarks

03:59.922 --> 04:02.337
so we can find the house
of the supermodels.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.959
- Why?
- Isn't it obvious?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.149
Every week,
they kick out a beautiful girl,

04:08.269 --> 04:11.021
making her feel unwanted
and without self-esteem.

04:13.269 --> 04:15.818
A.K.A. the future
Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.

04:17.535 --> 04:19.192
Is my hamburger medium well?

04:19.312 --> 04:20.596
Dill slices, not sweet?

04:20.814 --> 04:22.166
Individual relish packets?

04:22.286 --> 04:23.175
Onion rings?

04:23.295 --> 04:24.656
- Extra breading?
- I asked.

04:24.776 --> 04:26.311
What did they say?
Did you protest?

04:26.471 --> 04:27.835
- Yes.
- Vociferously?

04:28.057 --> 04:29.691
Then what took you so long?

04:31.831 --> 04:32.868
Just eat.

04:33.895 --> 04:35.237
Hey, guys, what'd I miss?

04:36.020 --> 04:37.531
Giselle's hanging by a thread.

04:37.691 --> 04:39.113
Oh, good, I hate her.

04:40.285 --> 04:42.602
Then you're not invited
to our wedding.

04:44.145 --> 04:45.586
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

04:45.706 --> 04:46.889
Do we have to suffer

04:47.009 --> 04:49.837
through this transparently
manipulative pseudo-reality again?

04:51.706 --> 04:53.608
You and I have
a standing TV schedule,

04:53.728 --> 04:56.121
which is the result of extensive
debate and compromise.

04:56.241 --> 04:58.312
Any alterations
except for breaking news

04:58.432 --> 05:00.887
have to be pre-approved
at the weekly roommate meeting.

05:02.203 --> 05:03.348
Put it on the agenda.

05:03.509 --> 05:05.562
You have to make a motion
to put it on the agenda.

05:05.682 --> 05:08.345
I'll make a motion,
but you're not going to like it.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.585
Fine.
Mock Parliamentary procedure.

05:12.705 --> 05:14.024
At least put it on mute.

05:15.434 --> 05:17.237
Giselle's not getting
kicked off.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.877
It's totally going to be Summer.

05:22.309 --> 05:24.494
- What?
- Sheldon's onion ring. Put it back!

05:25.032 --> 05:26.204
It's one onion ring.

05:26.364 --> 05:28.326
Just put it back before he comes!

05:29.159 --> 05:32.276
- No, I don't think that's where it was.
- Here he comes. Deny, deny, people.

05:32.396 --> 05:33.618
Wall of silence.

05:38.687 --> 05:41.099
- Who touched my...
- Penny! Penny did it.

05:43.869 --> 05:45.094
Why would you do that?

05:45.372 --> 05:47.559
I don't know. I was hungry?
What's the big deal?

05:47.719 --> 05:51.104
The big deal is that nobody
touches food on my plate.

05:51.307 --> 05:52.981
All right. I didn't know, I'm sorry.

05:53.246 --> 05:55.948
Well, I'm sorry,
but that is your second strike.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.155
What?

06:00.321 --> 06:01.739
You have two strikes.

06:02.572 --> 06:04.368
Three strikes and you're out.

06:06.259 --> 06:07.791
It's a sports metaphor.

06:09.197 --> 06:11.422
- A sports metaphor?
- Yes, baseball.

06:14.424 --> 06:16.952
All right, I'll play along.
What was my first strike?

06:17.124 --> 06:18.201
March 18th.

06:18.321 --> 06:21.392
You violated my rule
about forwarding email humor.

06:22.369 --> 06:23.265
I did?

06:23.385 --> 06:26.681
The photo of the cat who
wants to "has cheezeburger"?

06:28.323 --> 06:30.656
Come on.
Everybody loves "LOL cats."

06:30.776 --> 06:33.197
They're cute and they can't spell

06:33.880 --> 06:35.282
'cause they're cats.

06:36.384 --> 06:38.276
I trusted you with my email address,

06:38.396 --> 06:41.230
and you betrayed that trust
by sending me Internet banality:

06:41.350 --> 06:42.239
strike one.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.992
Touching my food: strike two.

06:47.652 --> 06:50.330
Don't worry. They only stay
on your record for a year.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.846
You can get them removed early,
but you have to take his class.

06:56.229 --> 06:58.839
Come on,
I touched one onion ring.

06:58.959 --> 07:00.297
And then you put it back,

07:00.480 --> 07:03.526
compromising the integrity
of all the other onion rings.

07:05.043 --> 07:07.891
Honey, the buses don't go
where you live, do they?

07:11.511 --> 07:13.189
I wish I could be
more lenient with you,

07:13.309 --> 07:15.754
but since you've become a permanent
member of our social group,

07:15.874 --> 07:18.630
I have to hold you to the same
standards as everybody else.

07:18.750 --> 07:21.287
Congratulations.
You're officially one of us.

07:22.479 --> 07:24.177
One of us, one of us.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.094
Well, what a thrill.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.120
You're sitting in my spot.

07:30.939 --> 07:33.439
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Leonard, she's in my spot.

07:35.547 --> 07:36.778
See, here's the thing.

07:36.898 --> 07:39.907
After you leave,
I still have to live with him.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.743
I don't care.
I'm taking a stand.

07:44.483 --> 07:45.593
Metaphorically.

07:47.606 --> 07:49.598
All right, that's it.
Strike three.

07:50.207 --> 07:51.524
Strike three.

07:53.386 --> 07:54.561
I'm banished?

07:54.721 --> 07:56.702
What the hell kind of crap is that?

07:57.920 --> 08:00.025
- Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
- Yeah, you do that.

08:00.185 --> 08:03.250
Just so I know, would you be open
to taking his class?

08:07.677 --> 08:09.144
You can do it online!

08:11.608 --> 08:13.121
So based on our triangulation,

08:13.241 --> 08:15.165
we've narrowed down
the location of the house

08:15.345 --> 08:17.876
to three square miles
in the Hollywood Hills.

08:18.324 --> 08:20.403
Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.

08:21.402 --> 08:23.676
When we find it,
you want to go with us?

08:23.796 --> 08:24.924
To do what?

08:25.127 --> 08:27.182
Party with the pretty girls, dude!

08:28.235 --> 08:30.546
Are you insane?
You're not going to party with them.

08:30.666 --> 08:32.986
You're not even going to get
anywhere near that place.

08:33.106 --> 08:35.881
That's what they said to Neil Armstrong
about the moon.

08:36.602 --> 08:38.929
No one said anything of the kind
to Neil Armstrong.

08:39.049 --> 08:41.905
The entire nation dedicated
a decade of effort and treasure

08:42.025 --> 08:43.360
to put a man on the moon.

08:43.544 --> 08:45.985
Well, my fellow Americans,
before this year is out,

08:46.105 --> 08:49.041
we will put a Wolowitz
on one of America's top models.

08:51.201 --> 08:54.329
And a large number of people
will believe it never happened.

08:56.110 --> 08:57.287
Okay, let me guess.

08:57.407 --> 09:00.377
A quesadilla with soy cheese
for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.

09:00.605 --> 09:03.036
- Thank you.
- Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds

09:03.156 --> 09:06.049
for the highly allergic
kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard.

09:06.965 --> 09:09.290
And for our suddenly
"back on the Hindu wagon" Raj,

09:09.410 --> 09:10.971
the meatlover's pizza, no meat.

09:13.415 --> 09:15.724
- Coming right up.
- Wait. Excuse me.

09:16.175 --> 09:18.260
You forgot my barbecue
bacon cheeseburger,

09:18.380 --> 09:20.647
barbecue sauce,
bacon and cheese on the side.

09:21.893 --> 09:25.277
I didn't tell you? You're banished
from the Cheesecake Factory.

09:26.419 --> 09:27.419
Why?

09:27.539 --> 09:29.156
Well, you have three strikes.

09:30.233 --> 09:32.024
One: coming in.
Two: sitting down.

09:32.144 --> 09:34.388
And three:
I don't like your attitude.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.110
You can't do that.

09:36.234 --> 09:38.486
Not only is it a violation
of California state law,

09:38.606 --> 09:41.501
it flies directly in the face
of Cheesecake Factory policy.

09:41.661 --> 09:45.007
Yeah, no, there's a new policy:
No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.

09:47.196 --> 09:49.925
I bet we could sell that sign
all over Pasadena.

09:52.163 --> 09:54.014
Can I talk to you for a minute?

09:58.567 --> 10:01.104
Here's the thing.
I talked to Sheldon

10:01.264 --> 10:03.129
and he feels terrible

10:03.517 --> 10:07.192
and he agrees that he was
unreasonable and out of line.

10:07.610 --> 10:08.820
Really? That's great.

10:10.144 --> 10:11.865
So just apologize to him, okay?

10:12.932 --> 10:15.301
What? I'm not going to apologize
to that nutcase.

10:15.421 --> 10:18.300
Come on. It's easy.
He'll even tell you what to say.

10:19.449 --> 10:22.183
Don't you get it? If you guys
keep going along with his insanity,

10:22.303 --> 10:25.054
- you're just encouraging him.
- We're not encouraging.

10:25.174 --> 10:27.437
It's more like...
knuckling under.

10:28.873 --> 10:30.281
I like hanging out with you,

10:30.401 --> 10:32.691
but I'm not gonna apologize
for something I didn't do.

10:32.811 --> 10:35.722
Well, actually, technically,
you did do it.

10:37.496 --> 10:38.884
That's strike one, Leonard.

10:41.027 --> 10:42.732
There you go: quesadilla.

10:43.248 --> 10:44.248
Salad.

10:44.465 --> 10:45.834
There's your pizza.

10:46.151 --> 10:49.069
And thanks to Sheldon's
heated discussion with my manager

10:49.229 --> 10:51.347
one barbecue bacon cheeseburger,
barbecue sauce,

10:51.467 --> 10:53.407
bacon and cheese on the side.

10:53.943 --> 10:54.783
Thank you.

10:56.315 --> 10:57.411
Go ahead. Eat it.

11:02.875 --> 11:03.887
I dare you.

11:13.243 --> 11:16.516
That's it. There's the house.
I found America's top models!

11:17.572 --> 11:19.157
- Are you sure?
- Look, on the roof.

11:19.277 --> 11:21.578
Anais and Giselle are sunbathing.

11:22.823 --> 11:24.232
European-style.

11:25.848 --> 11:27.774
You can recognize people
on Google Earth?

11:27.934 --> 11:31.913
Of course not. I got a buddy of mine
at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.

11:33.439 --> 11:35.865
NORAD?
You're using military aircraft?

11:36.025 --> 11:37.831
It was already targeted
to poke around

11:37.951 --> 11:39.645
a nuclear reactor in Siberia.

11:39.765 --> 11:42.246
I took it an hour
out of its way, tops.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.291
Where is he?

11:45.451 --> 11:47.835
Sheldon? I just dropped him off
at the comic book store. Why?

11:48.716 --> 11:50.309
Here. Try and go online.

11:50.870 --> 11:52.987
- Problem with the WiFi?
- Just try.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.802
<i>Greetings, hamburger toucher.</i>

11:57.588 --> 11:58.932
<i>You are probably wondering</i>

11:59.052 --> 12:01.095
<i>why you cannot IM
with your little friends</i>

12:01.215 --> 12:03.720
<i>about how much
you "heart" various things.</i>

12:05.972 --> 12:08.999
<i>This recorded message is alerting you

12:09.119 --> 12:11.859

12:16.409 --> 12:18.475
<i>set up your own WiFi
and pay for it,</i>

12:18.812 --> 12:21.034
<i>or you may apologize to me.</i>

12:25.645 --> 12:27.375
I reiterate: knuckle under.

12:28.606 --> 12:29.894
No, no. It is on.

12:30.014 --> 12:32.255
I am gonna introduce
your friend to a world of hurt.

12:32.688 --> 12:34.962
You don't want to get into it
with Sheldon.

12:35.082 --> 12:38.208
The guy is one lab accident away
from being a supervillain.

12:40.092 --> 12:44.077
I don't care. I was in junior rodeo.
I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 s.

12:46.512 --> 12:47.939
No need to neuter the nerd.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.814
I can get you back online.

12:50.381 --> 12:52.274
There, see? Problem solved.

12:54.773 --> 12:55.773
<i>Voilà.</i>

12:56.040 --> 12:57.825
<i>Hello, puny insects.</i>

12:59.968 --> 13:02.884
<i>As a consequence of your efforts
to circumvent my will,</i>

13:03.004 --> 13:05.926
<i>everyone is awarded
one additional strike.</i>

13:08.568 --> 13:09.584
Thanks a lot.

13:10.173 --> 13:13.071
What are you complaining about?
I have to take the class again.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.352
Time to do your laundry, huh?

13:29.160 --> 13:30.468
It's Saturday night.

13:30.588 --> 13:32.315
Saturday is laundry night.

13:32.929 --> 13:33.929
I know.

13:34.456 --> 13:36.757
Every Saturday at 8:15.

13:37.228 --> 13:38.874
Easy to anticipate.

13:42.126 --> 13:43.554
What are you implying?

13:43.674 --> 13:46.048
I'm implying
that you're a creature of habit.

13:46.703 --> 13:49.360
And if something were to prevent you
from doing your laundry

13:49.480 --> 13:50.792
on Saturday at 8:15,

13:51.228 --> 13:52.656
you might find it...

13:53.489 --> 13:54.501
unpleasant.

14:01.199 --> 14:02.706
Knuckle under? My ass.

14:12.437 --> 14:14.302
Are all the machines taken?

14:16.906 --> 14:18.447
What are you gonna do?

14:19.998 --> 14:21.069
No problem.

14:21.465 --> 14:22.477
I'll just...

14:22.834 --> 14:24.546
do my laundry another night.

14:25.863 --> 14:28.431
Another night?
Well, I guess you can try, but...

14:29.039 --> 14:30.287
deep inside your heart,

14:30.407 --> 14:34.164
you'll know that laundry night
is always Saturday night.

14:39.332 --> 14:42.248
Woman, you are playing
with forces beyond your ken.

14:43.398 --> 14:45.759
Yeah, well, your ken
can kiss my Barbie.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.725
- Where are my clothes?
- Your clothes?

15:02.845 --> 15:05.867
I left them in the washers
and when I went down, they were gone.

15:06.027 --> 15:07.027
Really?

15:07.282 --> 15:11.174
Despite the sign that says
"Do not leave laundry unattended"?

15:12.300 --> 15:13.875
Where are my clothes?

15:14.227 --> 15:18.168
You know, I do recall seeing
some female undergarments.

15:18.288 --> 15:19.288
Where was that?

15:20.994 --> 15:22.462
Earlier this evening,

15:22.819 --> 15:24.723
I happened to gaze out the window

15:24.843 --> 15:26.766
and a brassiere caught my eye.

15:28.189 --> 15:29.974
Do those look familiar?

15:30.470 --> 15:33.402
How the hell did you get them up
on that telephone wire?

15:34.017 --> 15:36.064
When you understand
the laws of physics,

15:36.184 --> 15:37.670
anything is possible.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.369
And may I add: mwuh-ha-ha.

15:44.666 --> 15:46.153
- Get them down.
- Apologize.

15:46.273 --> 15:47.761
- Never.
- Then may I suggest

15:47.881 --> 15:50.078
you get a very long stick
and play panty piñata.

15:52.228 --> 15:55.043
Wait, Sheldon,
this has gotten out of hand, okay?

15:55.163 --> 15:57.720
I've done some stupid things.
You've done some stupid things.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.088
How about we call it even
and move on with our lives?

16:00.248 --> 16:01.756
I've done no stupid things.

16:01.959 --> 16:04.493
- You gotta meet me halfway here.
- I am meeting you halfway,

16:04.613 --> 16:07.303
I'm willing to concede
that you've done stupid things.

16:10.584 --> 16:12.892
You guys are talking again.
Good.

16:15.589 --> 16:16.764
What happened?

16:17.577 --> 16:19.442
Remember when I said it was on?

16:19.562 --> 16:21.346
Well, now it's junior rodeo on.

16:23.921 --> 16:25.369
Not junior rodeo.

16:27.689 --> 16:28.741
What did you do?

16:28.901 --> 16:31.876
I had no choice, Leonard.
She ruined laundry night.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.594
Mwuh-ha-ha.

16:49.211 --> 16:51.869
Telephone wires can't electrocute you,
can they?

16:53.535 --> 16:54.934
Look, this has to stop.

16:55.688 --> 16:57.979
- No, no. It is just beginning.
- All right.

16:58.722 --> 17:01.096
I really didn't
want to do this, but...

17:03.680 --> 17:04.484
here.

17:05.271 --> 17:06.319
What's this?

17:07.590 --> 17:09.098
Sheldon's Kryptonite.

17:12.173 --> 17:13.640
Oh, my God.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.707
He can never know
that I gave that to you.

17:18.258 --> 17:20.400
Look, I said
I wanted to hurt him, but...

17:21.020 --> 17:22.053
but this?

17:24.630 --> 17:28.050
It'll shorten the war by five years
and save millions of lives.

17:32.851 --> 17:34.390
Pause it.
That's it. Confirmed.

17:34.937 --> 17:37.595
We now have the address
of the Top Model house.

17:39.142 --> 17:42.231
God bless you,
Google Street View registered trademark.

17:44.599 --> 17:47.153
For the record,
what you're doing is really creepy.

17:47.313 --> 17:48.952
You know what? If it's "creepy"

17:49.072 --> 17:52.597
to use the Internet, military
satellites, and robot aircraft

17:52.717 --> 17:54.737
to find a house full
of gorgeous young models

17:54.857 --> 17:56.821
so that I can drop in
on them unexpectedly,

17:56.941 --> 17:58.626
then fine, I'm "creepy."

18:05.891 --> 18:08.901
Hold on a second, I'll get him.
Sheldon, it's for you.

18:09.249 --> 18:10.676
- Who is it?
- Your mother.

18:11.043 --> 18:12.114
Oh, good.

18:13.482 --> 18:15.129
Hi, Mom. How are you?

18:17.330 --> 18:18.401
But, Mom...

18:20.531 --> 18:22.312
she keeps sitting in my spot.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.347
And she touched my food.

18:27.682 --> 18:30.717
Okay, yes, I took her clothes,
but she started it...

18:31.524 --> 18:33.083
No, that's not fair.

18:35.563 --> 18:37.744
Why should I have to apologize?

18:38.260 --> 18:41.541
I don't think this is the kind of thing
Jesus concerns himself with.

18:43.244 --> 18:44.304
No, you're right.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.645
I don't really know
what Jesus thinks about.

18:47.141 --> 18:49.045
All right, good-bye.

18:53.104 --> 18:54.220
Did you tell on me?

18:54.567 --> 18:57.223
Are you kidding me?
I already have two strikes.

19:10.818 --> 19:13.416
I am very, very sorry
for what I have done.

19:14.029 --> 19:16.449
Here's your laundry.
I rescind your strikes

19:16.794 --> 19:18.659
and you are no longer banished.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.831
Can I sit wherever I want?

19:24.994 --> 19:27.112
Never mind, never mind.
That's not important.

19:28.544 --> 19:29.996
Sheldon, this was big of you.

19:30.116 --> 19:32.465
- Thank you. I really appreciate it.
- Thank you.

19:37.664 --> 19:38.755
Well played.

19:42.345 --> 19:44.274
- Thank you.
- Just remember:

19:44.611 --> 19:47.328
with great power
comes great responsibility.

19:50.521 --> 19:51.612
Understood.

20:06.559 --> 20:07.710
Can I help you?

20:08.483 --> 20:10.248
We're here to fix the cable.

20:11.379 --> 20:13.243
I think we have satellite.

20:14.991 --> 20:16.340
That's what I meant.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.180
Come on in.

20:25.526 --> 20:29.076
She's taller than all the women
in my family combined.

20:31.476 --> 20:32.802
What do we do now?

20:35.584 --> 20:37.409
Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.
