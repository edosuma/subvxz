WEBVTT

00:10.355 --> 00:12.745
Somebody's gonna die over there.

00:12.928 --> 00:16.363
This house wants people's soul.

00:17.266 --> 00:20.167
There's this man. He
makes them kill themselves.

00:21.470 --> 00:24.638
They each suffered
fatal blows to the head.

00:24.640 --> 00:25.839
She was attacked.

00:27.109 --> 00:29.710
Mommy wasn't acting
right. Something's wrong.

00:29.712 --> 00:31.545
He's insane.

00:33.015 --> 00:35.649
This seems like a possession.

00:36.152 --> 00:38.319
I just hear death.

00:38.321 --> 00:40.588
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.590 --> 00:42.222
God.

00:42.224 --> 00:44.224
It's like, "I'm going to get you."

00:44.226 --> 00:45.326
I see dead people.

00:45.328 --> 00:46.594
Her face was all demonic.

00:46.596 --> 00:48.329
I speak to dead people.

00:48.331 --> 00:51.131
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

00:51.133 --> 00:52.533
And they speak to me.

00:52.535 --> 00:54.068
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

00:54.070 --> 00:57.204
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.206 --> 00:59.206
Something happened. Bam, bam, bam!

00:59.208 --> 01:00.774
I rely on my partner.

01:00.776 --> 01:02.343
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.345 --> 01:04.078
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.579
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

01:05.581 --> 01:08.782
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:08.784 --> 01:09.950
They're everywhere.

01:09.952 --> 01:11.352
It's my job to reveal them.

01:11.354 --> 01:13.420
This guy's got the
markings of a serial killer.

01:13.422 --> 01:16.223
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.225 --> 01:18.258
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.260 --> 01:19.493
...until the very end...

01:19.495 --> 01:21.161
Is this dead guy doing that to her?

01:21.163 --> 01:23.030
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.032 --> 01:25.132
That's it.

01:25.134 --> 01:26.400
...or time to get out.

01:26.402 --> 01:30.638
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:44.420 --> 01:48.022
I'm in East Flat Rock, North Carolina.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.457
It's about 30 minutes from Asheville.

01:50.459 --> 01:52.860
I got a call from a
young woman named Briana.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.262
Now, this poor kid's
story broke my heart.

01:55.264 --> 01:58.298
Both her parents died violently
while living in the house,

01:58.300 --> 02:00.067
and she blames it on the paranormal.

02:00.069 --> 02:02.603
Now, she thinks whatever killed them

02:02.605 --> 02:04.238
wants to take her out next.

02:08.811 --> 02:11.545
Before Amy arrives,
I have to clear the area

02:11.547 --> 02:14.014
of anything that could
influence her findings.

02:14.016 --> 02:18.686
Personal items, photographs,
and religious texts

02:18.688 --> 02:20.821
have to be covered or removed.

02:20.823 --> 02:24.391
When I'm finished,
tonight's walk can begin.

02:33.836 --> 02:37.805
There's something
weird about religion here.

02:37.807 --> 02:39.673
Their faith has been lost.

02:39.675 --> 02:41.975
Who is it you're
saying lost their faith?

02:41.977 --> 02:43.944
The people who live here.

02:43.946 --> 02:47.414
There's this man...

02:47.416 --> 02:48.849
and he's creepy.

02:49.785 --> 02:52.352
This crazy, manic guy

02:52.354 --> 02:56.757
manipulated them into
losing their faith.

02:56.759 --> 03:00.394
He's, thin, tall, white.

03:00.396 --> 03:02.629
He looks young. You
know, he looks like...

03:02.631 --> 03:05.165
I don't know...
you know, 20s maybe.

03:05.167 --> 03:08.469
He turns you from the good to the bad.

03:08.471 --> 03:13.540
That has something to do with
why they lost their faith.

03:13.542 --> 03:16.376
And it's because he's just...

03:16.378 --> 03:19.012
He's rancid.

03:25.020 --> 03:27.121
So, Briana, when
we spoke on the phone,

03:27.123 --> 03:28.255
you sounded pretty upset.

03:28.257 --> 03:29.623
Now that we're here,

03:29.625 --> 03:32.459
what are you hoping
that we can do for you?

03:32.461 --> 03:35.162
I want to be able to keep this home

03:35.164 --> 03:37.798
and not be afraid to come in here.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.100
I grew up here.

03:40.102 --> 03:42.736
I just don't want to give it up.

03:42.738 --> 03:45.939
There's just so much
family history here.

03:45.941 --> 03:49.042
So, before we get to that,
what's going on in the house?

03:49.044 --> 03:51.178
I hear sounds.

03:51.180 --> 03:53.247
I see shadows.

03:53.249 --> 03:55.716
Things move on their own.

03:55.718 --> 03:58.752
And while we're in the house,

03:58.754 --> 04:03.690
we have health problems and mood swings.

04:03.692 --> 04:05.392
So now, who do you live here with?

04:05.394 --> 04:07.494
My fiancÃƒÂ©, Tracy.

04:07.496 --> 04:10.264
So obviously, the
activity here now is bad.

04:10.266 --> 04:12.966
Was it like that when
you were growing up?

04:12.968 --> 04:14.101
Yes.

04:14.103 --> 04:19.238
But when my dad passed
away, it really picked up.

04:19.241 --> 04:21.541
Let's talk about what
happened with your father

04:21.543 --> 04:23.644
and how he died.

04:23.646 --> 04:25.679
He was going down the road.

04:25.681 --> 04:30.884
And they found his truck
flipped over on its side,

04:30.886 --> 04:32.719
no skid marks, nothing.

04:32.721 --> 04:35.489
The truck barely looked wrecked.

04:35.491 --> 04:37.691
- Did they deem it an accident?
- Yes.

04:37.693 --> 04:39.626
What do you think happened?

04:39.628 --> 04:41.962
Whatever is in here

04:41.964 --> 04:46.900
could have messed with
him or the vehicle.

04:46.902 --> 04:52.472
It seems like we're not meant
to have anybody in this house.

04:54.510 --> 04:57.010
So I know this is tough
to talk about, sweetie,

04:57.012 --> 04:58.679
but what exactly happened with Mom?

04:58.681 --> 05:01.949
She committed suicide.

05:01.951 --> 05:04.284
It'll be 2 years in November.

05:04.286 --> 05:10.057
Mom was the happiest,
nicest person in the world.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.792
Was there anything in her life

05:11.794 --> 05:13.694
that might have got her depressed?

05:13.696 --> 05:16.063
There was a renter,

05:16.065 --> 05:19.299
about 8 months before my mom passed,

05:19.301 --> 05:21.335
she found passed away.

05:21.337 --> 05:22.736
You remember her name?

05:22.738 --> 05:24.104
Laquada.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.840
They were very good friends.

05:26.842 --> 05:28.542
How did your mom commit suicide?

05:28.544 --> 05:32.112
With a shotgun that I bought her

05:32.114 --> 05:34.481
on the back porch.

05:34.483 --> 05:41.154
I feel real... really guilty
since I bought her the gun.

05:41.156 --> 05:43.190
Don't blame yourself.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.727
If people want to commit
suicide, they're gonna do it.

05:46.729 --> 05:48.228
Do you think the paranormal

05:48.230 --> 05:50.664
had something to do
with your mom's death?

05:50.666 --> 05:53.967
Whatever is in this
house is very strong.

05:53.969 --> 06:00.207
I think it could have got
to her and made her do that.

06:00.209 --> 06:03.944
This house wants people's soul.

06:07.449 --> 06:11.018
Okay. Somebody's
talking about a suicide.

06:11.020 --> 06:14.588
Something from in this direction

06:14.590 --> 06:17.391
made somebody kill themselves.

06:19.094 --> 06:20.427
And somebody's talking about,

06:20.429 --> 06:22.062
"It makes you feel depressed.

06:22.064 --> 06:24.064
It makes you feel weak,
weak, weak in the knees.

06:24.066 --> 06:25.399
Weak in the knees."

06:25.401 --> 06:26.667
Okay. Okay.

06:26.669 --> 06:29.202
Really bad neck pain
here, really **** bad.

06:29.204 --> 06:31.872
****

06:31.874 --> 06:34.975
****

06:34.977 --> 06:40.013
I'm seeing something
crawling out of water,

06:40.015 --> 06:41.748
something, a man.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.083
Nasty, nasty.

06:43.085 --> 06:44.718
He died bad, bad.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.354
And he's, like, revenge.
He's all about it.

06:47.356 --> 06:53.160
He influences people that he dislikes,

06:53.162 --> 06:55.429
and then he makes them kill themselves.

06:55.431 --> 06:59.466
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

07:05.407 --> 07:09.142
I haven't moved
much since she passed.

07:09.144 --> 07:12.279
I just want to keep
things how she left it.

07:12.281 --> 07:13.347
So tell me about

07:13.349 --> 07:14.681
some experiences you've had in the room.

07:14.683 --> 07:17.651
About a month after my dad passed,

07:17.653 --> 07:19.019
I wrote a note,

07:19.021 --> 07:21.855
this note right over here.

07:21.857 --> 07:23.123
Okay. That's the note?

07:23.125 --> 07:24.725
Yes.

07:24.727 --> 07:28.195
And I wrote, "I love you, Dad.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.930
Please sign this every night."

07:33.402 --> 07:34.534
He initialed it.

07:35.437 --> 07:38.005
Are you sure your mom didn't
get up in the middle of the night

07:38.007 --> 07:39.606
and sign this for you
to make you feel better?

07:39.608 --> 07:40.607
I'm sure.

07:40.609 --> 07:42.509
You can see her handwriting on the back.

07:42.511 --> 07:45.946
It doesn't match up.

07:45.948 --> 07:47.781
Anything else going on in this room?

07:47.783 --> 07:50.917
One day, I went to get in the shower.

07:50.919 --> 07:52.686
I laid my phone down.

07:52.688 --> 07:54.588
And I came out,

07:54.590 --> 07:56.857
and my phone was in
three different pieces.

07:56.859 --> 07:58.658
Anybody else home?

07:58.660 --> 08:00.827
Tracy was outside doing yard work.

08:00.829 --> 08:02.162
Have any kids in the
neighborhood that...

08:02.164 --> 08:04.564
We don't talk to nobody around here.

08:04.566 --> 08:06.199
It was right after I contacted you guys.

08:06.201 --> 08:07.401
You're kidding.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.769
Whatever's here,

08:08.771 --> 08:11.905
to me, don't want you guys here.

08:16.745 --> 08:18.345
Poltergeist, poltergeist,

08:18.347 --> 08:20.247
poltergeist, poltergeist, poltergeist.

08:20.249 --> 08:21.948
Damn.

08:21.950 --> 08:24.785
They think they have a poltergeist,

08:24.787 --> 08:26.086
but it's really him.

08:26.088 --> 08:28.188
- Who?
- The creepy guy.

08:28.190 --> 08:29.489
He's a manipulator.

08:29.491 --> 08:32.292
There are two powerful
dead people here...

08:32.294 --> 08:33.894
the vengeful guy outside

08:33.895 --> 08:36.563
who wants the living to kill themselves

08:36.565 --> 08:37.964
and the creepy guy in the house

08:37.966 --> 08:39.633
who makes people lose their faith.

08:41.537 --> 08:48.275
And I'm, like, seeing this,
like, dark...energy

08:48.277 --> 08:53.046
coming in, onto the floor, onto the bed.

08:53.048 --> 08:55.282
It's the creepy guy again.

08:55.284 --> 08:56.616
Aah.

08:58.387 --> 09:01.888
It's like somebody just came
up behind me and went... fomp!

09:01.890 --> 09:03.990
On my back.

09:03.992 --> 09:07.160
I can't breathe, and it hurts a lot.

09:09.731 --> 09:13.100
This seems like a possession to me.

09:13.102 --> 09:15.769
Yeah. Somebody's being
possessed by this dude.

09:15.771 --> 09:17.871
I want to say it's a woman.

09:18.941 --> 09:21.141
So that's bad.

09:26.915 --> 09:29.483
Okay, so tell
me about the experiences

09:29.485 --> 09:31.685
that you have when you're here.

09:31.687 --> 09:34.488
I see shadows, really tall.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.656
You can see an outline
of, like, a person.

09:36.658 --> 09:38.692
Okay. So where do you see it?

09:38.694 --> 09:40.327
In this corner.

09:40.329 --> 09:45.132
It'll move, like, from
the corner to the door.

09:45.134 --> 09:48.268
It feels evil. It doesn't want us here.

09:48.270 --> 09:50.303
Okay. Why do you say that?

09:50.305 --> 09:53.306
I'll get, like, sick to my stomach

09:53.308 --> 09:55.275
when I feel it's there.

09:55.277 --> 09:57.110
My chest will hurt.

09:57.112 --> 09:59.446
My heart will start racing.

09:59.448 --> 10:00.981
Yeah. It sounds like an anxiety attack.

10:00.983 --> 10:02.315
Do you suffer from that?

10:02.317 --> 10:03.416
No.

10:03.418 --> 10:05.085
Are you sure?

10:05.087 --> 10:08.455
I've tried talking to my
doctor about how sick I feel.

10:08.457 --> 10:10.590
She's like, "You're okay."

10:10.592 --> 10:11.925
Anything else?

10:11.927 --> 10:16.363
Very weird mood swings
when I'm in the house.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.331
Do you take any kind of
medication on a regular basis?

10:18.333 --> 10:19.466
Nothing.

10:19.468 --> 10:21.568
- And it's only when you're here?
- Yes.

10:21.570 --> 10:25.605
When I leave, maybe 5 minutes, I'm good.

10:25.607 --> 10:28.742
I'm really scared

10:28.744 --> 10:32.345
that it's gonna try and
make me take my life.

10:36.218 --> 10:39.452
Okay. So somebody in here is possessed.

10:39.454 --> 10:42.322
What is he making them do exactly?

10:42.324 --> 10:43.690
He's making them bad.

10:43.692 --> 10:46.560
They're, you know,
turning into a bad person.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.696
Boy.

10:49.698 --> 10:51.965
Okay, it's bad in here, you know?

10:51.967 --> 10:55.969
You've just got the bad
guy coming and going,

10:55.971 --> 10:57.804
coming and going, coming and going.

10:57.806 --> 11:00.073
How would he affect
the person in this room?

11:00.075 --> 11:02.542
They would think they
were losing their minds,

11:02.544 --> 11:08.982
feeling weird pains,
illnesses, um, feeling drained.

11:08.984 --> 11:10.617
Do you know what he
wants from the living?

11:10.619 --> 11:13.553
Yeah, you know, make them
kill everybody in, you know...

11:13.555 --> 11:15.055
- In the house?
- Yeah.

11:15.057 --> 11:16.990
Yeah. Yeah.

11:16.992 --> 11:18.858
That's his goal. That's what he wants.

11:18.860 --> 11:20.627
Why? Why does he want them to die?

11:20.629 --> 11:22.095
Because he's insane.

11:42.923 --> 11:44.990
So, Tracy, I talked to Briana,

11:44.992 --> 11:46.239
and, she's going through a lot.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.538
She was telling me

11:47.540 --> 11:49.874
how she's changed emotionally
while she's been here,

11:49.876 --> 11:51.476
mood swings and stuff like that.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.610
Have you noticed that?

11:52.612 --> 11:55.112
Yes. I've noticed mood swings with her.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.214
So what about yourself?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.602
Have you had your
own experiences here?

11:57.628 --> 11:57.949
Yes.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.417
Okay. Tell me about what's going on.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.916
We were sleeping in
the middle of the night.

12:01.016 --> 12:04.316
And I was awakened by the door opening.

12:04.416 --> 12:06.049
And it startled me so much

12:06.051 --> 12:08.993
to where I had retrieved my handgun

12:09.093 --> 12:10.993
to see who was coming in the house.

12:10.995 --> 12:12.828
There was no one in the house.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.830
Is it possible that the
door slammed out here

12:14.832 --> 12:16.398
at one of your neighbor's houses?

12:16.400 --> 12:19.168
Well, it's a different sound.

12:19.170 --> 12:20.903
Windows open that night?

12:20.905 --> 12:22.438
No windows open.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.239
Okay. So anything else?

12:24.241 --> 12:26.875
One weekend, as soon
as I opened the door,

12:26.877 --> 12:29.011
it just hit us right in the face.

12:29.013 --> 12:31.046
It was a horrible smell.

12:31.048 --> 12:35.717
It smelled like a rotting
carcass, roadkill.

12:35.719 --> 12:37.186
- Really?
- Yes.

12:37.188 --> 12:38.921
You never found any
remains of any animal

12:38.923 --> 12:40.489
that was dead or anything like that?

12:40.491 --> 12:42.324
Nope, no remains.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.893
Even under the house, there was nothing.

12:44.895 --> 12:48.530
Now, Briana told me about
a physical reaction she gets

12:48.532 --> 12:49.965
when she's upstairs.

12:49.967 --> 12:52.401
To me, it sounds like anxiety.

12:52.403 --> 12:54.003
Do you get any kind
of feeling like that?

12:54.029 --> 12:54.403
Yes.

12:54.405 --> 12:57.005
I can't fall asleep and get good sleep.

12:57.007 --> 12:59.441
I'm always anxious and nervous.

12:59.443 --> 13:00.509
Okay.

13:02.613 --> 13:05.214
This creepy guy smells
like rotting dead things,

13:05.216 --> 13:07.783
and it can make the living feel sick.

13:07.785 --> 13:09.351
They're always nauseous.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.186
I don't think anybody sleeps here.

13:11.188 --> 13:13.222
I think it would be **** impossible.

13:15.059 --> 13:17.526
It's too **** loud.

13:19.163 --> 13:23.298
And because of this, I
would say that the people

13:23.300 --> 13:29.238
become very, um, angry...

13:29.240 --> 13:32.174
short, um...

13:32.176 --> 13:35.344
argumentative.

13:35.346 --> 13:38.046
I, like... I'm literally
getting, like...

13:38.048 --> 13:39.581
Like, "Shut up."

13:39.583 --> 13:42.618
God. There's too much. Stop it.

13:49.493 --> 13:50.959
So, Kim, I understand

13:50.961 --> 13:52.995
you're really good
friends with the family.

13:52.997 --> 13:54.329
Right.

13:54.331 --> 13:56.398
Briana seems to think
that her mom's suicide

13:56.400 --> 13:57.566
had something to do with

13:57.568 --> 13:59.601
the activity that's
going on in this house.

13:59.603 --> 14:01.136
- Do you agree with that?
- Yes.

14:01.138 --> 14:02.404
Okay. Why?

14:02.406 --> 14:04.239
She always was really sweet and nice,

14:04.241 --> 14:05.507
and she just seemed like...

14:05.509 --> 14:07.776
All of a sudden, she seemed real evil.

14:07.778 --> 14:08.911
I can't say for sure,

14:08.913 --> 14:10.712
but she could have been demon possessed

14:10.714 --> 14:12.147
the way she was acting.

14:12.149 --> 14:15.417
Like, I got cold chills right
now just thinking about it.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.286
So what about yourself? Any experiences?

14:17.288 --> 14:18.820
I was by the steps.

14:18.822 --> 14:20.122
Okay.

14:20.124 --> 14:22.190
And all of a sudden, just
felt like some kind of force,

14:22.192 --> 14:25.093
like, almost pushed me down the steps.

14:25.095 --> 14:27.162
So how hard did you get pushed?

14:27.164 --> 14:28.864
Just push me so I can
get an idea what you...

14:28.866 --> 14:30.832
It was kind of like this,
and it was like... like that.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.768
Okay. So you went off balance.

14:32.770 --> 14:34.136
Right.

14:34.138 --> 14:36.905
All right, so enough where
it could have broke your neck.

14:36.907 --> 14:38.173
Right.

14:38.175 --> 14:40.409
It scared me so bad I didn't
want to ever come back.

14:40.411 --> 14:42.110
And I just feel like it's still here.

14:42.112 --> 14:45.714
Now, do you think Tracy
and Briana are in danger?

14:45.716 --> 14:46.651
Yes, I do.

14:46.951 --> 14:48.850
I think there's something evil in here.

14:48.852 --> 14:51.086
I'm afraid, if we don't do something,

14:51.088 --> 14:52.487
that they could be hurt.

14:55.759 --> 14:57.159
Okay.

14:57.161 --> 14:59.027
We've got a lot going on up here.

15:03.801 --> 15:04.800
It's the bad guy.

15:04.802 --> 15:06.802
He's blocking the **** out of me.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.809
He, has been trying to, jump me

15:13.811 --> 15:16.144
'cause he wants to
control me and stop me.

15:16.146 --> 15:19.248
This man is hanging upside down.

15:19.250 --> 15:23.518
He's, like, glued to the ceiling

15:23.520 --> 15:25.854
on his hands and knees.

15:25.856 --> 15:29.791
And he's, like, making
his, like, mouth open,

15:29.793 --> 15:32.394
you know, and his tongue
is, like, hanging out.

15:32.396 --> 15:35.964
He wants everybody, you know, to die.

15:49.184 --> 15:51.645
So, I haven't even started
my investigation yet,

15:51.745 --> 15:55.047
and I know about three deaths
on my client's property...

15:55.049 --> 15:56.448
Briana's mom's suicide,

15:56.450 --> 15:57.749
her dad's weird accident,

15:57.751 --> 16:00.152
and the renter who died
right on the property.

16:00.154 --> 16:02.921
Now, I managed to track
down that woman's daughter,

16:02.923 --> 16:05.357
and she thinks there's
something suspicious

16:05.359 --> 16:06.625
about her mom's death.

16:10.798 --> 16:12.831
Savannah, I want to
thank you for meeting me.

16:12.833 --> 16:14.967
I know this is a tough
thing to talk about.

16:14.969 --> 16:17.569
So, before we even get to what happened,

16:17.571 --> 16:20.205
what could you tell
me about your mother?

16:20.207 --> 16:21.340
She's a beautiful lady.

16:21.342 --> 16:23.041
I actually have a picture of her.

16:23.043 --> 16:25.644
- She was pretty. Wow.
- Yes.

16:25.646 --> 16:27.846
Everybody remembered her.

16:27.848 --> 16:30.282
If it wasn't her name,
it was her personality.

16:30.284 --> 16:32.117
And your mom's name was...

16:32.119 --> 16:33.552
Laquada.

16:33.554 --> 16:35.387
All right, but she wound up living

16:35.389 --> 16:37.856
in my client's house at some point?

16:37.858 --> 16:42.427
Yes, in July 2012, and passed June 2013.

16:42.429 --> 16:43.962
All right. So what happened?

16:43.964 --> 16:46.899
She did gain a good amount of weight,

16:46.901 --> 16:49.801
um, within a year, about 70 pounds.

16:49.803 --> 16:51.870
- Seventy pounds in one year?
- Yeah.

16:51.872 --> 16:53.839
Did she fluctuate in weight before?

16:53.841 --> 16:56.708
Nope. She was always 120 pounds.

16:56.710 --> 16:58.944
Now, I know you did
some digging into this

16:58.946 --> 17:00.913
because you were a little suspicious

17:00.915 --> 17:02.481
about the circumstances of her death.

17:02.483 --> 17:04.782
Yes. I did manage to get

17:04.785 --> 17:06.785
a medical examiner's death certificate.

17:06.787 --> 17:08.287
Okay.

17:10.925 --> 17:14.226
Okay. So Mom was 54 when she died.

17:14.228 --> 17:15.594
Okay.

17:15.596 --> 17:18.829
And here is the autopsy
report I was sent.

17:23.470 --> 17:27.306
So, sweetie, she's got an
awful lot of medication in her.

17:27.308 --> 17:28.339
Yes.

17:28.342 --> 17:29.808
What was the reason for all that?

17:29.810 --> 17:32.945
She was in a very serious
car accident in 1997.

17:32.947 --> 17:34.179
Okay.

17:34.181 --> 17:35.380
Well, this is strange.

17:35.382 --> 17:37.516
The contributing factors
leading to her death

17:37.518 --> 17:38.817
were undetermined?

17:38.819 --> 17:41.486
I don't know.
Something just isn't right.

17:41.488 --> 17:42.888
Did something fail on her?

17:42.890 --> 17:45.524
Did she have a massive heart attack?

17:45.526 --> 17:49.661
What would all of a sudden just
cause a decently healthy woman

17:49.663 --> 17:52.230
to just not wake up the next day?

17:52.232 --> 17:53.298
It hurts.

17:55.069 --> 17:58.236
I can imagine it would hurt.

17:58.238 --> 18:00.939
Nothing worse than not knowing

18:00.941 --> 18:03.709
what the hell the answer is.

18:06.547 --> 18:09.915
I feel that something just isn't right.

18:09.917 --> 18:14.686
And I have no closure,
no answers, no reasons.

18:14.688 --> 18:16.254
You don't think it's a suicide?

18:16.256 --> 18:17.522
I don't.

18:17.524 --> 18:18.957
So let me ask you.

18:18.959 --> 18:20.626
Do you think the house

18:20.628 --> 18:22.527
might have had something
to do with your mom's death?

18:22.529 --> 18:24.596
Yes.

18:29.370 --> 18:34.539
I'm seeing, like, a dead lady,
probably in her mid to late 40s.

18:34.541 --> 18:38.944
And she's short, white, plump.

18:38.946 --> 18:41.647
And she's got bleached blond hair.

18:41.649 --> 18:43.415
You know, she curls it.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.117
She's wearing, like,

18:45.119 --> 18:47.519
a sweatshirt and jeans and tennis shoes.

18:47.521 --> 18:51.056
So she's recent, you
know, like, by her clothes.

18:51.058 --> 18:53.325
And she's blaming the house.

18:53.327 --> 18:57.162
She said, "The house, the house.
I know the house killed me."

19:05.673 --> 19:09.307
I feel fear, a lot of fear.

19:09.309 --> 19:13.345
It's almost like somebody
got their head cracked open.

19:13.347 --> 19:15.647
Like, it feels like that to me.

19:15.649 --> 19:18.684
This is very, very bad, very, very bad.

19:19.853 --> 19:21.720
My God.

19:21.722 --> 19:23.889
I don't know what the
**** is going on here.

19:26.827 --> 19:30.028
Like, it's, like, a vise
grip on my **** head here.

19:32.066 --> 19:34.566
So far, I've
got three tragic deaths

19:34.568 --> 19:36.635
associated with Briana's property,

19:36.637 --> 19:40.372
two of them her own parents.

19:40.374 --> 19:42.441
But I need to see if
there's anything else

19:42.443 --> 19:44.142
that could help my investigation.

19:44.144 --> 19:45.911
Searching through old records,

19:45.913 --> 19:48.380
I see the previous owners, the Shipmans,

19:48.382 --> 19:51.183
lost not one but two of their children

19:51.185 --> 19:53.285
right on my client's property.

19:53.287 --> 19:55.220
So I'm on my way to
meet with a genealogist

19:55.222 --> 19:57.089
who looked into the
Shipman family for me.

19:57.091 --> 19:58.857
She says she's got information

19:58.859 --> 20:01.059
that will definitely help my case.

20:06.300 --> 20:07.933
So, Edith, you mentioned on the phone

20:07.935 --> 20:09.768
the Shipman family
had a pretty tough time

20:09.770 --> 20:11.703
on my client's property
when they were there.

20:11.705 --> 20:13.171
When exactly did they get there?

20:13.173 --> 20:15.474
They bought the property in 1952.

20:15.476 --> 20:17.809
They held on to it till 1994.

20:17.811 --> 20:20.078
Okay. So who exactly moved in?

20:20.080 --> 20:24.149
Well, Clarence, his wife,
Elsie, and their son, Sherwood.

20:24.151 --> 20:26.718
What were you able to find
out about Clarence himself?

20:26.720 --> 20:28.587
Well, here's a picture of him.

20:28.589 --> 20:32.224
He did farm those 13 acres
that he was living on,

20:32.226 --> 20:34.092
and he was also a cook
in a local restaurant.

20:34.094 --> 20:35.093
Okay.

20:35.095 --> 20:36.661
I know they lost a couple of kids

20:36.663 --> 20:38.096
while they were living on the property.

20:38.098 --> 20:39.331
Who was the first?

20:39.333 --> 20:42.234
So I have the death certificate
here of Martha Verda,

20:42.236 --> 20:45.170
who was the first
child to die at age 44.

20:45.172 --> 20:46.938
She died of cancer.

20:46.940 --> 20:49.374
The second child to
die young was Sherwood.

20:49.376 --> 20:52.244
He died of a sudden heart
attack at 59 years old.

20:52.246 --> 20:54.846
Now, when he died,
he was pretty wealthy.

20:54.848 --> 20:57.215
He had several successful businesses.

20:57.217 --> 20:59.618
Okay. So what happened with Clarence?

20:59.620 --> 21:01.720
Here's the death
certificate for Clarence.

21:01.722 --> 21:03.088
He died of a heart ailment,

21:03.090 --> 21:04.723
and he might have been ill for some time

21:04.725 --> 21:05.857
leading up to that.

21:05.859 --> 21:07.893
Okay.

21:07.895 --> 21:10.095
Well, I appreciate you really
looking into this for me.

21:10.097 --> 21:11.997
You know, there's something else I found

21:11.999 --> 21:13.732
when I was looking into this family.

21:13.734 --> 21:16.234
One of the most gruesome
murders in Henderson County

21:16.236 --> 21:18.637
occurred in the '60s,

21:18.639 --> 21:20.438
and one of the victims was a Shipman.

21:25.679 --> 21:28.446
Heart attack, heart attack.

21:29.983 --> 21:34.820
Somebody died here from a heart attack

21:34.822 --> 21:37.556
or at the hospital, whatever,

21:37.558 --> 21:40.525
but they had a ****
heart attack here.

21:40.527 --> 21:43.328
I wonder if it happened in
the house or right outside.

21:43.330 --> 21:45.664
He's old. I know that. He's **** old.

21:47.835 --> 21:49.668
And then this dead lady,

21:49.670 --> 21:51.736
the one who says the house killed her,

21:51.738 --> 21:53.638
she points to the little dead man.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.775
And she says, "And I'm pretty
sure that it killed him, too."

21:56.777 --> 21:59.244
Yeah. This place is very bad.

21:59.246 --> 22:01.079
****

22:06.420 --> 22:07.919

22:07.921 --> 22:09.621
unexplained activity in your home,

22:24.141 --> 22:26.108
So Edith's tip checked out.

22:26.110 --> 22:29.444
Turns out, there was a
triple homicide back in 1966.

22:29.446 --> 22:32.047
And one of the victims was
a relative of the Shipmans.

22:32.049 --> 22:35.617
I'm on my way to meet
with a local crime reporter

22:35.619 --> 22:37.986
who says the case remains
unsolved to this day.

22:43.127 --> 22:45.093
So, Emily, thanks for
looking into this case for me.

22:45.095 --> 22:46.562
I appreciate that.

22:46.564 --> 22:48.931
Let's start from the beginning.
The victims, who were they?

22:48.933 --> 22:52.968
The first victim was
62-year-old Louise Shumate.

22:52.970 --> 22:54.436
What do we know about her?

22:54.438 --> 22:56.572
She lived in a town a few miles away

22:56.574 --> 22:57.906
and worked at a music company.

22:57.908 --> 23:01.009
She was kind of a mystery
for the investigators

23:01.011 --> 23:03.045
in connection to the other two.

23:03.047 --> 23:04.212
Okay.

23:04.214 --> 23:06.448
The second victim was Vernon Shipman.

23:06.450 --> 23:08.150
So this is the guy

23:08.152 --> 23:10.018
that's related to the people
that owned my client's property.

23:10.020 --> 23:12.187
Yes. He was 43.

23:12.189 --> 23:14.056
He owned the Tempo Music Store,

23:14.058 --> 23:16.658
which is just a couple
of doors down from here.

23:16.660 --> 23:17.759
All right.

23:17.761 --> 23:19.995
He actually had a romantic relationship

23:19.997 --> 23:23.498
with the third victim,
36-year-old Charles Glass.

23:23.500 --> 23:27.502
Glass was the manager
of Tempo Music Store.

23:27.504 --> 23:30.305
So what do you know
about this guy, Glass?

23:30.307 --> 23:32.774
He kind of lived a flamboyant life.

23:32.776 --> 23:36.545
He didn't seem to care too
much about public opinion.

23:36.547 --> 23:40.649
He wrote a book on voodoo or a magazine.

23:40.651 --> 23:41.950
On voodoo?

23:41.952 --> 23:43.619
On voodoo. Really?

23:43.621 --> 23:45.220
This could be interesting for the case.

23:49.460 --> 23:53.295
I'm seeing the revenge guy.

23:53.297 --> 23:54.730
He was murdered.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.733
Any idea when this was?

23:57.735 --> 24:01.036
I'm getting like '40s, '50s.

24:01.038 --> 24:02.571
Okay.

24:02.573 --> 24:05.040
This vengeful guy who gets
people to kill themselves

24:05.042 --> 24:06.308
is showing me how he died,

24:06.310 --> 24:08.010
and it's beyond brutal.

24:08.012 --> 24:09.778
He was on his way home from work.

24:09.780 --> 24:12.914
To me, it seems like he was attacked.

24:14.251 --> 24:17.452
Seems like there's multiple people,

24:17.454 --> 24:19.254
at least four people.

24:19.256 --> 24:22.224
It's nighttime. He's scared.

24:22.226 --> 24:23.792
He's scared.

24:25.195 --> 24:27.396
They kill him. They kill him.

24:27.398 --> 24:31.133
And, and they, like,
leave him there to rot.

24:31.135 --> 24:34.169
And now he's taking revenge.

24:34.171 --> 24:39.074
The bodies were found July 22, 1966.

24:39.076 --> 24:42.010
They were discovered in a grassy
field near a body of water.

24:42.012 --> 24:45.180
They were found laying
in this semicircle,

24:45.182 --> 24:46.948
and they were all facing up

24:46.950 --> 24:48.850
and they all had
objects on their bodies.

24:48.852 --> 24:50.519
Really?

24:50.521 --> 24:52.554
You know, I've seen
cases like this before,

24:52.556 --> 24:54.589
where bodies will be
displayed in a certain manner.

24:54.591 --> 24:56.591
A lot of times, it's a sociopath

24:56.593 --> 24:58.860
that's just trying to send a message.

24:58.862 --> 25:00.662
I think, the way they were found,

25:00.664 --> 25:03.331
a lot of people thought it
was ritualistic in nature.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.766
Interesting.

25:04.768 --> 25:07.536
So, what is the official
cause of death of each victim?

25:07.538 --> 25:10.272
Well, according to
the death certificates,

25:10.274 --> 25:12.841
they each suffered
fatal blows to the head.

25:12.843 --> 25:15.477
Fractured skull, fractured skull.

25:15.479 --> 25:18.780
Was anybody ever arrested and charged?

25:18.782 --> 25:20.615
There were several suspects,

25:20.617 --> 25:24.653
but no official arrests were ever made.

25:24.655 --> 25:27.689
50 years later, it remains unsolved.

25:27.691 --> 25:29.591
Okay.

25:30.728 --> 25:34.496
Every time I walk inside,
the creepy guy flips out.

25:34.498 --> 25:36.832
He's trying to jump
me and get me to leave.

25:36.834 --> 25:39.434
He's making my head hurt really bad.

25:39.436 --> 25:41.803
Yeah. He's pissed now.

25:41.805 --> 25:43.371
He's not happy.

25:43.373 --> 25:46.174
He doesn't want me to
know anything about him,

25:46.176 --> 25:48.944
and he's doing everything
he can to screw with my head.

25:48.946 --> 25:50.679
He ain't giving me ****

25:50.681 --> 25:53.248
All I know is, he liked opera.
He liked classical music.

25:53.250 --> 25:54.883
He was wealthy. He liked theater.

25:54.885 --> 25:57.052
He liked literature.

25:57.054 --> 26:00.122
Are you okay?

26:00.124 --> 26:05.026
He was definitely in a mental
institution that's nearby.

26:05.028 --> 26:07.329
He's very upset about this.

26:07.331 --> 26:09.531
He was deranged his entire life.

26:18.075 --> 26:20.709
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

26:20.711 --> 26:24.312
so I'm meeting with a sketch
artist to describe two of them.

26:24.314 --> 26:26.681
First, the woman who
said the house killed her.

26:26.683 --> 26:31.853
She was probably in
her early to mid 40s.

26:31.855 --> 26:35.757
Her face was pretty roundish,

26:35.759 --> 26:38.126
definitely had some
lines around her mouth.

26:40.697 --> 26:42.631
Next, I describe the creepy man

26:42.633 --> 26:45.901
trying to possess someone
in the bedroom downstairs.

26:45.903 --> 26:51.840
There was this black fuzz coming up,

26:51.842 --> 26:53.809
onto the bed.

26:53.811 --> 26:58.013
And it's surrounding the person
that's closest to the window,

26:58.015 --> 26:59.981
engulfing them.

27:06.523 --> 27:08.490
Is this what you saw?

27:08.492 --> 27:10.892
Yes.

27:30.292 --> 27:33.026
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:33.028 --> 27:35.595
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:35.597 --> 27:38.731
and our clients for the first time.

27:38.733 --> 27:42.969
So, Amy, I want you meet Briana,
and this is her fiancÃƒÂ©, Tracy.

27:42.971 --> 27:44.604
I don't want to give away too much,

27:44.606 --> 27:46.873
but this poor kid's been
through hell in this house.

27:46.875 --> 27:49.309
As the night goes on,
you're gonna see why

27:49.311 --> 27:52.345
she so desperately wants
to hold on to this house.

27:52.347 --> 27:54.347
The trouble is, she
thinks that whatever's here

27:54.349 --> 27:56.416
is after her and that she's in danger.

27:56.418 --> 27:59.953
Now that Amy knows just a
little bit about you guys,

27:59.955 --> 28:02.455
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

28:05.560 --> 28:08.661
There was a lot of stuff going on.

28:08.663 --> 28:10.230
Right away, I got something

28:10.232 --> 28:12.232
about people losing their faith here.

28:12.234 --> 28:14.868
Then, I went to the backyard.

28:14.870 --> 28:18.605
And a woman came forward

28:18.607 --> 28:22.008
and said that she believed
that this house had killed her.

28:23.011 --> 28:25.879
She was pretty short.

28:25.881 --> 28:29.582
She was, like, I want
to say pleasantly plump.

28:29.584 --> 28:32.619
She had bleached blond hair.

28:32.621 --> 28:35.555
You might be onto something here,

28:35.557 --> 28:38.825
but I don't want to
jump the gun just yet.

28:38.827 --> 28:40.894
Did you get anything
else from this woman?

28:40.896 --> 28:43.830
Not really. It was a
very short exchange.

28:43.832 --> 28:47.534
But I did have a sketch done of her.

28:53.375 --> 28:55.408
It's a really damn good sketch.

28:59.147 --> 29:01.414
Look like anybody to you?

29:01.416 --> 29:04.784
Yeah. But the hair's
throwing me off a little bit.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.386
I don't know if you noticed,

29:06.388 --> 29:08.988
but one of the bedrooms
upstairs has no furniture in it.

29:08.990 --> 29:10.456
It's, like, hardly anything in it.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.524
Yeah.

29:11.526 --> 29:14.894
In 2012, a renter moved into that room.

29:14.896 --> 29:17.830
Her name was Laquada Cantellops.

29:17.832 --> 29:19.666
Now, in June of 2013,

29:19.668 --> 29:22.001
she wound up dying
in her sleep upstairs.

29:22.003 --> 29:25.772
Interesting.

29:25.774 --> 29:27.840
I have her death certificate.

29:27.842 --> 29:31.377
Now, to this day, there's still
no official cause of death.

29:31.379 --> 29:33.012
It's still undetermined.

29:33.014 --> 29:35.615
Now, when I spoke with
Laquada's daughter,

29:35.617 --> 29:37.750
she gave me a picture of her mom.

29:37.752 --> 29:39.619
And when I show you the picture,

29:39.621 --> 29:43.489
you're gonna know why
that sketch blew my mind.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.760
This is Laquada right here.

29:50.732 --> 29:52.699
Does this look like the
person you might've seen?

29:52.701 --> 29:55.501
Yeah. It looks very much like her.

29:55.503 --> 29:58.438
The resemblance is uncanny.

30:02.477 --> 30:04.744
I went into the backyard.

30:04.746 --> 30:06.779
I got that somebody killed themselves.

30:06.781 --> 30:11.250
I didn't get much
information on who it was,

30:11.252 --> 30:15.221
but I did feel, um, some
very horrible neck pain.

30:15.223 --> 30:20.159
And the person who did this

30:20.161 --> 30:24.664
was influenced by a deceased male.

30:24.666 --> 30:29.569
And what he does is,
he actually goes around,

30:29.571 --> 30:34.007
and he will draw the
depression out of someone

30:34.009 --> 30:38.144
to the point where they
will then kill themselves.

30:39.614 --> 30:45.451
Mom committed suicide on the
back porch with a shotgun.

30:47.255 --> 30:50.923
Um, it was unexpected.

30:50.925 --> 30:54.327
Nothing was left...
no note, no nothing.

30:54.329 --> 30:58.598
I've always thought
something pushed her to do it.

30:59.768 --> 31:02.468
I got a photo of her mom.

31:07.942 --> 31:10.810
I did manage to track
down the death certificate.

31:10.812 --> 31:14.047
All right, so this is the
official cause of death.

31:14.049 --> 31:15.848
That's probably where
the pain's coming in.

31:15.850 --> 31:17.116
Yeah.

31:17.118 --> 31:19.218
Tell Amy how, the last
couple of weeks, though,

31:19.220 --> 31:20.353
she did change.

31:20.355 --> 31:24.157
Her attitude changed, more worried.

31:24.159 --> 31:27.093
She wasn't the type of
person to stand up to anyone.

31:27.095 --> 31:28.461
Okay.

31:28.463 --> 31:29.862
And over the past couple weeks before,

31:29.864 --> 31:31.164
she started standing up to people.

31:34.536 --> 31:37.203
So now, this dead guy
you're talking about

31:37.205 --> 31:39.272
that influences people
to kill themselves,

31:39.274 --> 31:41.307
how's he do that?

31:41.309 --> 31:44.377
I saw him crawling
out of a body of water.

31:44.379 --> 31:46.612
And he does not look good.

31:46.614 --> 31:48.081
And what he does is,

31:48.083 --> 31:51.017
he gets vulnerable
people to do things...

31:51.019 --> 31:53.619
things like shoot themselves,
cut themselves, take pills,

31:53.621 --> 31:57.690
turn the car on, anything
to get the job done.

31:57.692 --> 31:59.992
Okay, so you think that this dead guy

31:59.994 --> 32:02.428
influenced Briana's mom to kill herself?

32:02.430 --> 32:04.964
Yes.

32:04.966 --> 32:08.568
Now, Briana's lost her father, too.

32:08.570 --> 32:12.538
I got a photo that Briana had given me

32:12.540 --> 32:14.640
of her and her dad.

32:16.745 --> 32:18.745
Tell Amy what happened to your dad.

32:18.747 --> 32:20.847
He was working on his truck one day

32:20.849 --> 32:23.783
at one of his friends' homes.

32:23.785 --> 32:26.919
And the truck had flipped
over on its side...

32:26.921 --> 32:31.924
no skid marks, no witnesses, no nothing.

32:31.926 --> 32:35.495
The cops couldn't
tell us why he wrecked.

32:35.497 --> 32:37.663
This is why Briana's so determined
to hold on to this house.

32:37.665 --> 32:40.733
This is the last of her
connection to her parents.

32:40.735 --> 32:45.972
I just want to stay where my family was.

32:45.974 --> 32:50.409
It means so much to me to be
able to stay in this house.

32:50.411 --> 32:53.713
I recognize that I'm
pretty much the only family,

32:53.715 --> 32:56.015
the only support group she has left.

32:57.752 --> 33:00.620
So whatever we need
to do to keep her safe,

33:00.622 --> 33:01.854
it's exactly what we're gonna do.

33:05.026 --> 33:08.027
Do you have any idea who this
guy might have been in life?

33:08.029 --> 33:11.898
Yeah. I think that he
died fairly recently.

33:11.900 --> 33:14.200
I got the '40s or the '50s.

33:14.202 --> 33:15.368
He died at night,

33:15.370 --> 33:17.804
and he was on his way home from work.

33:17.806 --> 33:21.908
I got that he was attacked
by at least four people.

33:21.910 --> 33:23.376
He was terrified.

33:23.378 --> 33:26.078
They killed him somewhere else,

33:26.080 --> 33:28.147
and then they threw him in the water

33:28.149 --> 33:30.283
to get rid of him.

33:30.285 --> 33:33.619
So he was murdered violently.

33:33.621 --> 33:35.721
Now he just is very angry

33:35.723 --> 33:38.991
and just functioning off of one thing,

33:38.993 --> 33:40.960
and that is revenge.

33:40.962 --> 33:42.361
That terrifies me.

33:43.765 --> 33:45.932
There's a couple of
things that you were saying

33:45.934 --> 33:48.100
that remind me of a triple homicide

33:48.102 --> 33:50.036
that occurred in town in 1966.

33:50.038 --> 33:51.838
Now, the police theorize

33:51.840 --> 33:55.041
that the victims were
murdered in one place

33:55.043 --> 33:56.642
and then left near a lake.

33:56.644 --> 33:58.845
One of the victims of
that triple homicide

33:58.847 --> 34:00.379
was this guy, Vernon Shipman.

34:00.381 --> 34:02.181
He was a
43-year-old male.

34:02.183 --> 34:03.816
He was actually related

34:03.818 --> 34:06.052
to one of the original
owners of the property here.

34:06.054 --> 34:09.355
The second victim was
this guy, Charles Glass,

34:09.357 --> 34:10.790
who was 36 at the time.

34:10.792 --> 34:13.192
Now, Charles was his lover.

34:13.194 --> 34:16.829
Now, thing about Glass,
which was interesting,

34:16.831 --> 34:19.665
is that he wrote about voodoo.

34:19.667 --> 34:21.400
What?

34:21.402 --> 34:24.971
He self-published a book

34:24.973 --> 34:28.074
about tales of voodoo and black magic.

34:28.076 --> 34:31.244
Now, there was a third victim,

34:31.246 --> 34:35.313
who was a 62-year-old
female named Louise Shumate.

34:35.315 --> 34:38.083
Now, I got death certificates for them.

34:38.085 --> 34:41.487
All three were basically
bludgeoned to death in the head.

34:43.324 --> 34:45.391
Now, this happened almost 50 years ago,

34:45.393 --> 34:47.360
and it's still unsolved to this day.

34:47.362 --> 34:53.299
So the thing that interests
me here is the voodoo thing.

34:53.301 --> 34:57.503
If he practiced the black
magic and the voodoo,

34:57.505 --> 35:00.239
I would think it would be him.

35:00.241 --> 35:02.341
Pretty mad if it's the one

35:02.343 --> 35:05.211
that made my mom do what she did.

35:08.549 --> 35:10.983
Anything else?

35:10.985 --> 35:12.985
I met another person.

35:12.987 --> 35:15.187
And this person seemed to me

35:15.189 --> 35:19.926
to be a much larger,
direct threat as of now.

35:19.928 --> 35:22.161
He was extremely tall, very creepy.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.896
This person was extremely wealthy.

35:23.898 --> 35:25.865
He was very into music.

35:25.867 --> 35:29.135
I got that he had been in
and out of mental institutions

35:29.137 --> 35:30.269
when he was alive.

35:30.271 --> 35:33.172
He is very unstable.

35:33.174 --> 35:35.441
So the guy that you were describing,

35:35.443 --> 35:37.910
when I pulled the deed for the property,

35:37.912 --> 35:39.812
it was a 13-acre farm.

35:39.814 --> 35:42.815
And it was just basically
hardworking people here

35:42.817 --> 35:44.951
nobody that fits that description.

35:44.953 --> 35:46.752
But when you mention music,

35:46.754 --> 35:48.821
all three of the murder victims
worked in the music industry.

35:48.823 --> 35:50.189
Okay. Interesting.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.558
But I don't think this creepy guy

35:52.560 --> 35:54.627
is connected to any of them.

35:54.629 --> 35:59.332
The other thing with him is
that he smells really bad.

35:59.334 --> 36:02.001
We'd been away for about a week.

36:02.003 --> 36:05.638
When we came back up
and we opened the door,

36:05.640 --> 36:07.807
and this awful, awful smell

36:07.809 --> 36:09.709
just hit both of us right in the face.

36:09.711 --> 36:11.644
It was terrible.

36:11.646 --> 36:13.346
This **** what else does he do?

36:13.348 --> 36:15.982
He can cause physical problems.

36:15.984 --> 36:18.150
What I got was, like,
feeling physically sick,

36:18.152 --> 36:22.388
being nauseous, and feeling drained.

36:22.390 --> 36:24.957
He makes the living
feel like they're crazy.

36:24.959 --> 36:27.126
He'll make you feel intense anxiety.

36:27.128 --> 36:29.528
And people will feel manic.

36:29.530 --> 36:32.131
And the reason why he's so dangerous

36:32.133 --> 36:35.301
is because he can change
and influence people.

36:35.303 --> 36:39.905
He can make people see good people

36:39.907 --> 36:42.074
as being bad or evil.

36:42.076 --> 36:45.478
I'll get really sick on my stomach,

36:45.480 --> 36:47.513
and my energy's just gone.

36:47.515 --> 36:51.817
And my head hurts all the time.

36:51.819 --> 36:54.053
Do you guys ever get manic episodes?

36:54.055 --> 36:55.521
Enraged, yes.

36:55.523 --> 36:58.924
I'll be happy one minute,

36:58.926 --> 37:01.727
pissed off at him for no reason,

37:01.729 --> 37:03.329
and then depressed.

37:03.331 --> 37:04.764
Well, you're, you know,

37:04.766 --> 37:06.932
basically living with a sociopath.

37:11.539 --> 37:14.740
So, when I was in the
downstairs bedroom,

37:14.742 --> 37:18.544
I saw this black mist thing coming in,

37:18.546 --> 37:21.580
dipping down onto the floor

37:21.582 --> 37:24.683
and then coming up around the bed.

37:24.685 --> 37:26.886
It was this sociopath.

37:26.888 --> 37:29.221
He was influencing and affecting

37:29.223 --> 37:32.191
and trying to possess this person.

37:32.193 --> 37:34.393
I felt that it was a female

37:34.395 --> 37:39.465
and that what he was attempting
to do or doing was a possession.

37:39.467 --> 37:40.900
****

37:40.902 --> 37:42.068
That was your mother's room.

37:42.070 --> 37:43.969
She's the only person
that slept there, right?

37:43.971 --> 37:45.271
Yes. All right.

37:45.273 --> 37:48.941
So I had a sketch done of what I saw.

37:57.285 --> 37:59.218
I'm sorry, honey.

37:59.220 --> 38:00.619
I don't even want to
show you this, but...

38:03.925 --> 38:07.626
I think this is probably what
was going on with your mom.

38:07.628 --> 38:09.595
My God.

38:14.135 --> 38:16.569
I'm really pissed off.

38:16.571 --> 38:18.537
My mom didn't deserve that.

38:19.740 --> 38:22.074
She didn't deserve to be picked on.

38:22.076 --> 38:24.844
That's kind of the way
that I felt like she was

38:24.846 --> 38:25.911
towards the end.

38:25.913 --> 38:29.014
The life was being strangled out of her.

38:29.016 --> 38:31.484
Do we think he's going after Briana now?

38:31.486 --> 38:33.285
That's what I'm afraid of, yeah.

38:35.089 --> 38:38.057
What he wanted to have happen

38:38.059 --> 38:42.294
and what he would like to
eventually see happen here

38:42.296 --> 38:46.265
is to cause the individual
to kill everyone in the house.

39:02.697 --> 39:04.415
So, Briana, when we first met,

39:04.515 --> 39:06.949
you had told me you thought
that your mother's suicide

39:06.951 --> 39:08.358
had something to do with the paranormal.

39:08.458 --> 39:11.059
- Yes.
- And it turns out, you were right.

39:11.061 --> 39:14.663
Now we need to find out how
to kick these dead people out

39:14.665 --> 39:16.197
so that you can honor your parents

39:16.199 --> 39:17.499
and raise your family

39:17.501 --> 39:19.267
here in the house that
you so badly want to be in.

39:20.034 --> 39:22.601
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:25.319 --> 39:28.487
It's my belief that your
mother was, unfortunately,

39:28.489 --> 39:33.292
being influenced by two
very unsavory characters,

39:33.294 --> 39:34.960
one being the dead guy

39:34.962 --> 39:38.063
that influences people
to kill themselves

39:38.065 --> 39:40.499
and another being a dead male

39:40.501 --> 39:44.836
who was trying to possess
her to harm others.

39:44.838 --> 39:48.006
I think your mother, on some level,

39:48.008 --> 39:50.976
knew that this was happening

39:50.978 --> 39:54.012
and that, in fact, she
had a choice to make.

39:54.014 --> 39:58.283
And she chose to take the option

39:58.285 --> 40:01.587
that would not harm
anybody else but her.

40:01.589 --> 40:04.189
Do you see what I'm saying?

40:04.191 --> 40:05.791
- Yep.
- Yeah.

40:05.793 --> 40:08.093
She would do anything to protect me.

40:09.663 --> 40:12.130
What I would like to see happen

40:12.132 --> 40:18.837
would be to have a priest come
and bless the property line.

40:18.839 --> 40:22.307
And this is, you know,
going to keep him away.

40:22.309 --> 40:24.843
All right. So what about
the **** inside the house?

40:24.845 --> 40:27.913
The more intense thing

40:27.915 --> 40:32.985
is to have a priest do
an exorcism of the house

40:32.987 --> 40:35.787
to get rid of him.

40:35.789 --> 40:38.624
It might get a little intense.

40:40.294 --> 40:43.829
I also believe that the dead want you

40:43.831 --> 40:49.901
to return to being more religious.

40:49.903 --> 40:53.005
They feel like that's
something you need.

40:53.007 --> 40:59.144
Up until now, I was mad
at God for taking my mom,

40:59.146 --> 41:00.612
letting her do what she did.

41:00.614 --> 41:02.047
If that will help...

41:07.688 --> 41:09.921
...get this gone

41:09.923 --> 41:13.625
and me to be strong enough
to get my faith back,

41:13.627 --> 41:16.194
I will.

41:16.196 --> 41:18.230
If these guys do what you told them,

41:18.232 --> 41:21.400
could she start a family and live here?

41:21.402 --> 41:22.668
I believe so, yeah.

41:22.703 --> 41:25.704
As long as whatever it is is gone.

41:25.706 --> 41:28.207
I mean, we're gonna do what
we can to get it out of here.

41:28.209 --> 41:30.509
I'm ready to get this started

41:30.511 --> 41:32.244
and get whatever it is gone.

41:33.347 --> 41:36.048
If Briana and
Tracy follow my advice

41:36.050 --> 41:37.583
and bring in a priest

41:37.585 --> 41:40.219
to bless the property
and perform an exorcism,

41:40.221 --> 41:42.588
they'll be able to safely raise a family

41:42.590 --> 41:45.291
in the childhood home
Briana loves so much.
