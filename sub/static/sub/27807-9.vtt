00:01.535 --> 00:02.601
Hello?

00:02.602 --> 00:04.603
There's definitely
something here.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.805
What was done in this room
got somebody to burn in hell.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.374
Something in this house
is not right.

00:09.376 --> 00:10.775
Is that the case?

00:10.777 --> 00:13.745
Is there something bad here
that we should be worried about?

00:13.747 --> 00:15.881
I hear he's a monster.

00:15.883 --> 00:17.115
I got to get out of here.

00:17.117 --> 00:19.451
Did you do something
to this family?

00:20.787 --> 00:22.120
"I killed them."

00:22.122 --> 00:25.023
If you say the wrong thing
about the wrong spirit,

00:25.025 --> 00:26.258
you're gonna pay for it.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.094
I mean, the things
that went on in that house

00:29.096 --> 00:34.165
were sick
and depraved and powerful.

00:36.003 --> 00:39.704
When the dead are
forgotten, they become restless.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.907
My God!
You just touched me.
What? I did not touch you.

00:41.909 --> 00:43.575
I'm Amy Bruni.

00:43.577 --> 00:46.745
A haunting encounter
redefined my life.

00:46.747 --> 00:50.181
I live with that experience
and seek answers to the unknown.

00:50.183 --> 00:52.250
It says, "I am."

00:52.252 --> 00:53.985
I'm Adam Berry.

00:53.987 --> 00:57.155
At Gettysburg, the shadows
and screams of dead soldiers

00:57.157 --> 00:59.424
turned me
into a supernatural believer.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.959
My God.

01:00.961 --> 01:04.229
Together, our investigations
bring peace to the living...

01:04.230 --> 01:06.364
You can't scare us,
you can't deter us.

01:06.366 --> 01:08.266
...by giving a voice
to the dead.

01:08.268 --> 01:10.168
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.670
What is your name?

01:11.672 --> 01:14.606
Because we believe the dead
and the living are all...

01:14.608 --> 01:16.441
kindred spirits.
Kindred spirits.

01:18.278 --> 01:21.513
It's the dead of winter
in Villisca, Iowa.

01:21.515 --> 01:24.149
Adam and I are investigating
for the first time

01:24.151 --> 01:26.351
the site of a murder
so gruesome

01:26.353 --> 01:29.487
it shocked the nation
into paralyzing fear.

01:29.489 --> 01:32.490
In 1912, the Moore family
and two guests

01:32.492 --> 01:35.060
were brutally murdered
by an unknown assailant.

01:35.062 --> 01:38.430
The killer remained at large
and is now presumed dead,

01:38.432 --> 01:41.032
but some say
he never left the home,

01:41.034 --> 01:43.335
and the house is still a place
of fear for the living.

01:43.337 --> 01:46.705
Eight people were axed to death
in their sleep --

01:46.707 --> 01:48.139
Two adults and six children.

01:48.141 --> 01:49.841
And weren't two of the kids,
like, on a sleepover?

01:49.843 --> 01:50.609
Yeah, two visiting kids.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.743
Yeah.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.112
And it's so crazy because
whoever did it

01:54.114 --> 01:57.148
used the actual sharp end of
the ax on the man in the house,

01:57.150 --> 01:59.017
and then all the kids
and the woman,

01:59.019 --> 02:00.685
he used the blunt side
of the ax.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.220
So he just beat them to death,
basically?

02:02.222 --> 02:03.955
It was the most brutal,
horrific,

02:03.957 --> 02:05.256
like, you can't even imagine
how bad it was.

02:05.258 --> 02:06.658
God.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.094
And they think that he was
in the attic waiting for them

02:09.096 --> 02:10.762
because they found
cigarette butts up there.

02:10.764 --> 02:11.863
My God.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.299
That's crazy, man.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.035
The house was purchased
in 1994

02:17.037 --> 02:21.172
by a local resident who restored
its 1912 interior,

02:21.174 --> 02:23.241
giving the home
an unsettling feeling,

02:23.243 --> 02:26.611
like the murdered family
could return at any moment.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.881
Since then, it's been open
to amateur ghost hunters

02:29.883 --> 02:32.450
who've come only to
sometimes have violent

02:32.452 --> 02:34.586
and terrifying results.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.355
The guy that's meeting us here,
John Worley,

02:37.357 --> 02:39.758
He's one of those
amateur investigators.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.060
I received this, like,
flurry of messages

02:42.062 --> 02:43.728
and e-mails that were
just desperate.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.063
He's terrified
of this house.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.699
He won't set foot in it
because he's convinced

02:47.701 --> 02:51.770
that the activity he experienced
here a year and a half ago...

02:51.772 --> 02:52.771
Yeah.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.172
...has cursed him
in some way.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.441
He got a voice recording
that says,

02:56.443 --> 02:57.108
"Just kill John Worley."

02:57.110 --> 02:58.410
Weird.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.745
He said ever since,
his life has just been awful.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.180
And he's meeting us here,
around back?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.682
He's meeting us around back.
So let's go find him.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.683
Yeah, yeah.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.351
John's story is
every investigator's

03:06.353 --> 03:07.819
worst nightmare --

03:07.821 --> 03:10.255
bringing a malevolent
spirit home with you.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.824
Things are so bad for John,
he refuses to enter the house

03:12.826 --> 03:15.427
and will only speak to us
in the barn.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.595
Investigators that come in
to the Villisca house

03:17.597 --> 03:19.230
have frightening tales
of activity,

03:19.232 --> 03:20.932
but nothing like this.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.000
Sorry about the weather.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.401
That's okay.

03:23.403 --> 03:25.904
We braved the weather because of
what happened to you, you know?

03:25.906 --> 03:27.038
Thanks.
I appreciate that.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.206
We want to figure out
what's going on.

03:28.208 --> 03:33.511
Well, I never thought
I'd ever come back here.

03:33.513 --> 03:39.250
Um, a group of my friends
and I came here

03:39.252 --> 03:41.586
and bring in
all our equipment.

03:41.588 --> 03:46.558
One of the audio recordings that
we got was not friendly at all,

03:46.560 --> 03:50.995
and it said, "Leave at once,"
in a very strong whisper.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.530
We could tell
it was a killer.

03:52.532 --> 03:53.765
Okay.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.434
So, what happened to you
specifically?

03:56.436 --> 03:58.269
What got me scared --

03:58.271 --> 04:02.974
I got a recording that says,
"Just kill John Worley."

04:02.976 --> 04:04.008
That's me!

04:04.010 --> 04:05.410
Wow. We'll have to
listen to that

04:05.412 --> 04:06.845
before we start
investigating.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.847
That's the tip
of the iceberg.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.950
It was September 23rd,
when we came.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.986
February 28th,
my brother-in-law

04:14.988 --> 04:18.289
went to ICU in a coma

04:18.291 --> 04:20.524
and died.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.160
Shortly thereafter,

04:22.162 --> 04:26.798
my brother goes to the ICU
in a coma.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.466
While this is going on,

04:28.468 --> 04:30.835
my mother-in-law
was diagnosed

04:30.837 --> 04:33.605
with stage IV
ovarian cancer

04:33.607 --> 04:35.473
and died six weeks later.

04:35.475 --> 04:36.608
My God.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.177
I'm thinking, "My God.
What did I do?

04:39.179 --> 04:41.913
Did I do this
by going to Villisca?"

04:41.915 --> 04:44.649
- God.
- I just need to know I'm safe.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.551
I need to know
my family's safe

04:46.553 --> 04:48.720
and I didn't do any of this.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.022
If I did, I want it to stop,
and I need help.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.423
- Right. Okay.
- Okay.

04:52.425 --> 04:53.725
That's why we're here,

04:53.727 --> 04:55.760
and so we'll get to
the bottom of it.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.595
I know you've been through
so much.

04:57.597 --> 04:58.997
So I'm sorry.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.231
I don't want you
to go in there

05:00.233 --> 05:02.400
if you don't feel comfortable
going in there.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.669
So we can just take
the information that we have

05:04.671 --> 05:07.138
and start,
and if we have questions,

05:07.140 --> 05:09.607
we can let you know
if we need anything else.

05:09.609 --> 05:10.608
We're gonna figure it out.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.277
Yeah.
We're gonna do our best.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.145
I'm sorry.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.381
Is it possible
the Villisca Ax Murderer

05:16.383 --> 05:17.816
attached himself to John

05:17.818 --> 05:20.652
and caused these tragic events
in his life?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.655
Amy and I need to find out
if the killer is in this house,

05:23.657 --> 05:26.825
and if so,
why would he go after John?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.560
With the potential
of contacting

05:28.562 --> 05:29.794
such a dark entity,

05:29.796 --> 05:32.197
it is important that Amy and I
are mentally strong

05:32.199 --> 05:33.731
as we begin
this investigation.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.801
Is that the family?

05:36.803 --> 05:38.269
I think that's part
of them, yeah.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.904
Yeah.

05:42.909 --> 05:48.313
Everyone deserves to sleep
and not be afraid, you know?

05:48.315 --> 05:51.049
Like, that's when you're
at your most vulnerable.

05:52.485 --> 05:55.053
And they found the two girls
here first.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.021
The two children
who were visiting

05:57.023 --> 06:00.091
were sleeping in this room
when they were murdered.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.593
Somebody covered
the mirrors

06:01.595 --> 06:05.897
because the killer covered all
the mirrors and the windows.

06:05.899 --> 06:09.334
And he covered their heads with,
like, clothes and stuff

06:09.336 --> 06:12.470
'cause he felt like
they were watching him.

06:16.810 --> 06:20.245
This puts into perspective
how close they were.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.614
Yeah, and they didn't
wake up, like...?

06:22.616 --> 06:25.617
No, because they didn't have
a chance to make a sound.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.122
The Moore children
were found beaten to death

06:31.124 --> 06:34.292
in this second-floor bedroom --
all four of them.

06:34.294 --> 06:38.529
5, 7, 10, and 11
were the kids up here.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.066
It's heavy as ****

06:42.068 --> 06:43.468
It's very heavy.

06:43.470 --> 06:44.936
It's heavy.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.038
I just don't understand
how someone does something

06:47.040 --> 06:52.877
like that, like, how much rage
you have to have inside you.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.679
Who waits in the attic?

06:54.681 --> 06:56.247
The authorities believed
the killer

06:56.249 --> 06:58.383
entered the home
sometime during the day

06:58.385 --> 07:01.319
and waited patiently for
the family to fall asleep.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.454
This is the attic, right,
where he hid?

07:03.456 --> 07:04.622
Yeah.

07:04.624 --> 07:07.358
What took place in this house
is unimaginable.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.128
Such a sudden and tragic end
to eight lives

07:10.130 --> 07:13.564
gives a clear reason for spirits
of both good and evil

07:13.566 --> 07:16.534
to be trapped here,
but by the feel of this house,

07:16.536 --> 07:19.671
chances are something darker
is present.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.908
To make sure every inch
of this house is covered

07:23.910 --> 07:25.343
and we're protected,

07:25.345 --> 07:27.478
we're putting surveillance
cameras in all the rooms.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.084
John sent us the recording
he captured

07:33.086 --> 07:35.553
a year and a half ago that
he believes was the catalyst

07:35.555 --> 07:37.956
of the life-altering
evil attachment.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.491
I can pull up the EVP
so I can play for you

07:40.493 --> 07:41.859
exactly what he sent me.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.227
You know what,
let's use it.

07:43.229 --> 07:43.995
Yeah.

07:48.702 --> 07:52.136
So, this is what he sent us,
right, from the night?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.739
Yeah.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.447
"Just kill..."

08:02.449 --> 08:04.682
"...John Worley."

08:04.684 --> 08:06.484
I mean,
it's a creepy voice.

08:06.486 --> 08:10.588
We need to find the entity
responsible for this EVP.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.924
Is it the killer,
or is it someone else?

08:12.926 --> 08:15.827
Using our own digital
voice recorder,

08:15.829 --> 08:18.062
we're reaching out
to the spirits in the house

08:18.064 --> 08:19.097
for answers.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.665
Whoever's in this house
with us

08:20.667 --> 08:23.634
who's non-living,

08:23.636 --> 08:28.940
we were called here
by a friend.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.042
My name is Adam.

08:31.044 --> 08:34.746
And I'm Amy.

08:34.748 --> 08:38.750
We know a lot of people come
in here trying to talk to you.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.719
We don't mean
any disrespect.

08:41.721 --> 08:47.058
But our friend John,
who was here, needs our help.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.060
Can I --
I'm gonna play this for you.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.763
He -- He heard
a voice here.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.365
Do you recognize this?

08:59.906 --> 09:04.275
Do you recognize
that voice?

09:04.277 --> 09:09.047
Can you tell us
who that voice is?

09:09.049 --> 09:13.017
John feels like there
was something bad here

09:13.019 --> 09:16.954
that left its mark on him.

09:16.956 --> 09:20.458
Is that the case?

09:20.460 --> 09:22.126
Is there
something bad here

09:22.128 --> 09:23.694
that we should be
worried about?

09:25.665 --> 09:27.865
Did you hear that?

09:27.867 --> 09:32.103
It was like a, "Whaa."

09:32.105 --> 09:35.473
I mean, I had set
this crime scene up

09:35.475 --> 09:37.975
the way they had found it.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.744
I remember screaming.

09:39.746 --> 09:43.748
The knife was in my lung
and shoulder.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.074

09:57.764 --> 09:59.597
Amy and I
are investigating a home

09:59.599 --> 10:01.199
where eight lives
were taken

10:01.201 --> 10:03.968
in a totally senseless
and violent act.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.637
We're reaching out to the
spirits using a digital recorder

10:06.639 --> 10:09.607
in order to help John Worley,
who believes an evil spirit

10:09.609 --> 10:13.077
attached to him after a night
of amateur investigation.

10:13.079 --> 10:18.049
John feels like there
was something bad here

10:18.051 --> 10:21.385
that left its mark on him.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.054
Is there
something bad here

10:23.056 --> 10:25.356
that we should be
worried about?

10:28.928 --> 10:31.062
Did you hear that?

10:31.064 --> 10:33.664
It was like a, "Whaa."

10:36.136 --> 10:38.569
It was like, "Whaa."

10:38.571 --> 10:40.905
I thought I heard
a man's voice.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.975
Maybe you were saying
"what" or...

10:43.977 --> 10:47.011
If you're upstairs,
let us know.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.675
It's so quiet.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.211
Wow.
I was not expecting that.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.946
I wasn't either.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.715
Why is this entity
hiding from us?

11:24.717 --> 11:27.385
Is it watching us,
waiting?

11:27.387 --> 11:29.487
Let's head upstairs.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.355
We're moving our investigation
upstairs,

11:31.357 --> 11:32.990
where the Moore children
were killed,

11:32.992 --> 11:36.060
all four of them,
and trying something new.

11:36.062 --> 11:38.162
I'll use a KII EMF meter,

11:38.164 --> 11:41.065
which detects any paranormally
generated energy,

11:41.067 --> 11:43.201
and Amy will try again
on the recorder.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.336
We were hearing someone
talk downstairs.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.505
It sounded like a man.

11:47.507 --> 11:51.742
Is there a man up here with us,
or someone else?

11:53.046 --> 11:56.280
Can you tell us your name?

11:56.282 --> 11:58.382
Do you know
our friend John?

12:00.687 --> 12:04.789
Are we safe here?

12:04.791 --> 12:06.424
Let's listen.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.863
Nothing's happening
in there.

12:22.141 --> 12:24.208
- Very quiet.
- That's so strange, though.

12:24.210 --> 12:27.345
That's not what
I expected here at all.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.779
I didn't want to come in,
like, guns blazing.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.147
Guns blazing, yeah.

12:30.149 --> 12:33.184
I wanted to kind of come in
kind of softly and, like,

12:33.186 --> 12:35.653
let them familiarize themselves
with us.

12:35.655 --> 12:36.454
Which is what we've done.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.455
Yeah.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.024
But I don't know
if it's working.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.859
Adam and I have to get
a response

12:41.861 --> 12:45.329
from whatever is here in order
to get answers for John.

12:45.331 --> 12:47.765
So we're going to meet with
other investigators

12:47.767 --> 12:50.201
who have experienced
significant activity

12:50.203 --> 12:51.736
at the Villisca house.

12:51.738 --> 12:54.905
The most disturbing case
involves a man named Buck.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.108
Five years ago,
during an investigation,

12:57.110 --> 12:59.043
he blacked out,
only to be found

12:59.045 --> 13:01.145
with his own knife
in his chest

13:01.147 --> 13:03.881
and no recollection
of how it happened.

13:03.883 --> 13:07.918
Buck has never spoken publicly
about that night until now.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.756
So, we appreciate you coming
to tell your side of the story.

13:11.758 --> 13:15.493
And first off, let me thank you
guys for the opportunity.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.528
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

13:17.530 --> 13:21.065
My -- My health has gone
completely downhill.

13:21.067 --> 13:26.370
I- I had previously had a stroke
a couple years before this.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.039
Yeah.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.508
So, can you just
kind of tell us

13:30.510 --> 13:34.312
in your own words
what went on that night?

13:34.314 --> 13:35.413
Yes.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.981
My stepfather
and my mother --

13:36.983 --> 13:41.786
they got the house for the night
for a birthday present from me.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.454
- Okay.
- And I had done

13:43.456 --> 13:48.259
a lot of research into what
the crime scene looked like.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.661
I mean, I had set
this crime scene up

13:50.663 --> 13:53.531
the way they had found it.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.200
The only thing I forgot
was the ax.

13:57.203 --> 13:59.403
Well, since
I don't have the ax,

13:59.405 --> 14:02.273
I have a hunting knife
on my chest.

14:02.275 --> 14:07.945
And I started trying
to ask questions.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.214
Nothing was happening,
you know?

14:10.216 --> 14:12.817
And I guess not really knowing,

14:12.819 --> 14:17.455
I started to provoke

14:17.457 --> 14:20.057
and say a lot of bad things

14:20.059 --> 14:24.462
about the gentleman who can
kill six ch-children.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.531
And then, um,
on the radio...

14:33.506 --> 14:36.841
And I look over to the closet,

14:36.843 --> 14:41.278
and it was the biggest orb
I've ever seen.

14:42.515 --> 14:47.852
And next thing I remember
is I remember screaming.

14:47.854 --> 14:51.856
The knife was in my lung
and shoulder.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.124
My God.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.894
I didn't do it to myself.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.596
From an investigative point
of view,

14:58.598 --> 14:59.864
I'm looking for patterns.

14:59.866 --> 15:03.367
It always seemed like it
just went off pure emotion.

15:03.369 --> 15:05.136
I do not feel comfortable
sitting here.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.005
This is gonna be --
I do not feel okay.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.907
Something just tapped
the recorder.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.142
I heard that.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.676
Are you behind me?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.957
It's day 2 in Villisca, Iowa.

15:26.959 --> 15:30.327
We're meeting an investigator
who had a near-death experience

15:30.329 --> 15:32.696
at the site
of a 1912 ax murder

15:32.698 --> 15:34.465
after going head-to-head

15:34.467 --> 15:36.967
with what he thinks
was an evil spirit.

15:36.969 --> 15:40.304
To this day,
he is still visibly shaken.

15:40.306 --> 15:44.775
I had set this crime scene up
the way they had found it.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.844
And since I don't have the ax,

15:46.846 --> 15:49.613
I have a hunting knife
on my chest.

15:49.615 --> 15:54.118
And I started to provoke.

15:55.121 --> 15:58.222
And I look over to the closet,

15:58.224 --> 16:03.627
and it was the biggest orb
I've ever seen.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.930
And I remember screaming.

16:05.932 --> 16:10.434
The knife was in my lung
and shoulder.

16:10.436 --> 16:16.207
And I woke up tied to a bed
and tube down m-my throat.

16:16.209 --> 16:19.243
So, you don't remember
anything?

16:19.245 --> 16:20.511
I do remember this.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.746
I didn't do it to myself.

16:22.748 --> 16:24.682
There is something there.

16:24.684 --> 16:29.286
My stepfather and my mother
have an EVP,

16:29.288 --> 16:32.122
and you hear a voice,
plain as day, say,

16:32.124 --> 16:34.391
"Don't worry about Buck.
We'll get him."

16:34.393 --> 16:36.594
Unfortunately,

16:36.596 --> 16:38.262
my mother destroyed
everything.

16:38.264 --> 16:41.465
Can you describe the voice,
what it sounded like at all?

16:41.467 --> 16:42.933
It was a little whisper,
a little --

16:42.935 --> 16:44.635
you know, a little
on the quiet side.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.304
I want to play for you
an EVP.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.414
That was it.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.384
Where did you get that?

17:00.386 --> 17:04.221
A gentleman captured
that EVP in the house.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.022
That's unnerving.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.692
You say the wrong thing
about the wrong spirit,

17:08.694 --> 17:10.594
and you're gonna pay for it.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.195
Do you think your actions
in that house

17:12.198 --> 17:14.431
instigated
what happened to you?

17:14.433 --> 17:16.599
100%.

17:16.602 --> 17:19.803
I'm sorry for
everything you've gone through.

17:19.805 --> 17:22.873
Do you have any interest,
or would you be able

17:22.875 --> 17:26.844
to go to the house with us
and show us where this happened?

17:26.846 --> 17:30.681
Um, I've -- I've thought
about it long and hard.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.217
And...I -- yes.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.852
You will?

17:34.854 --> 17:36.186
It's something I need to do.

17:36.188 --> 17:37.087
Okay.

17:37.089 --> 17:40.691
I have to face
that f-fear.

17:44.430 --> 17:48.832
So, th-this is
where it happened.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.901
Okay,
and you were on the bed?

17:50.903 --> 17:55.172
Y- Yes, sir.

17:55.174 --> 17:58.576
Th-Th-The camera was there.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.477
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:00.479 --> 18:02.746
I was laying like this.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.014
Okay.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.517
Knife was h-here.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.621
And I started to provoke.

18:10.623 --> 18:14.592
I was very vulgar.

18:14.594 --> 18:19.330
And right over there

18:19.332 --> 18:22.833
came that orb.

18:22.835 --> 18:26.503
I remember my stepfather
coming in.

18:26.505 --> 18:30.774
There was a knife
sticking in my shoulder.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.910
And he pulled it out.

18:36.048 --> 18:41.752
So, how do you feel
being in here now?

18:41.754 --> 18:43.821
Please, forgive me.

18:43.823 --> 18:47.625
I didn't deserve
what happened to me.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.728
S- Something in this house
is not right.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.333
There we go.
Well, you came here.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.268
You've faced it.
And you can leave it here.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.837
- Right here.
- Yeah.

18:59.839 --> 19:03.674
I can't express enough

19:03.676 --> 19:05.809
how much
I thank you guys.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.750
I can't believe he just
re-created the whole thing

19:12.752 --> 19:14.918
exactly to the crime scene.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.153
And it wasn't
working for him,

19:16.155 --> 19:18.355
so he even pushed it further
by provoking.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.090
And, like,
when is it too much?

19:20.092 --> 19:22.793
And clearly,
he regrets it.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.962
The other person I think
we really need to talk to --

19:24.964 --> 19:27.464
So, Johnny Houser
is an investigator,

19:27.466 --> 19:31.201
and he's probably investigated
this place hundreds of times.

19:31.203 --> 19:35.205
So I would love to hear what
he thinks about this house.

19:35.207 --> 19:38.208
We had a gentleman,
his name is John Worley.

19:38.210 --> 19:43.280
He got an EVP in the building,
and the EVP says,

19:43.282 --> 19:45.082
"Just kill John Worley."

19:45.084 --> 19:47.551
And we're noticing, like,
we've had activity here,

19:47.553 --> 19:49.787
but it's not been nearly
to the level

19:49.789 --> 19:53.057
of what the people who asked us
for help experienced.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.225
Or what I would expect.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.327
I've investigated
this place

19:57.329 --> 19:59.530
easily far more
than any one ever has.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.031
Of course.
Of course.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.900
And from an investigative
point of view,

20:02.902 --> 20:04.367
I'm looking for patterns.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.537
Can I predict when things
are happening?

20:06.539 --> 20:10.541
And it always seemed like it
just went off pure emotion.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.709
Okay.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.778
I heard a thud,
and I freaked myself out.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.548
And then things started
compounding on top of that.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.483
It's, like,
totally feeding off fear.

20:19.485 --> 20:22.720
Interesting. Like,
have you seen experiences

20:22.722 --> 20:24.488
from people that provoke?

20:24.490 --> 20:25.756
You know,
people talk about,

20:25.758 --> 20:28.025
"The ax murderer
is in the house."

20:28.027 --> 20:29.660
And so I went in the attic

20:29.662 --> 20:31.261
and just kind
of started going off.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.363
It's like, "Dude,
how could you do this?

20:33.365 --> 20:34.565
It's sick."

20:34.567 --> 20:36.867
Instantly,
footsteps down here.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.302
And it wasn't to
the point of,

20:38.304 --> 20:40.404
"Was that a footstep?
Was that a ghost?"

20:40.406 --> 20:41.505
It was like...

20:41.507 --> 20:43.407
- Footsteps.
- Somebody's in the house.

20:43.409 --> 20:46.577
I think the house kind of looks
at that like, "Okay.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.580
You want to test this? We'll see
how far we can push this."

20:49.582 --> 20:50.781
- Yeah.
- That makes a lot of sense.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.282
That makes so much sense.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.384
Last night, we were being very
soft and we were being kind.

20:54.386 --> 20:55.853
We didn't mention anything
about the murders.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.356
What would you suggest
that we should talk about

20:59.358 --> 21:01.625
if we wanted
any kind of interaction?

21:01.627 --> 21:03.026
This is what I would do.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.528
Send one person in,

21:04.530 --> 21:06.497
sit upstairs
just by yourself,

21:06.499 --> 21:08.298
put a chair right in front
of the attic

21:08.300 --> 21:10.067
with my back
to the opening.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.270
It seems like the nasty stuff
comes out of the attic.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.573
And if that's truly where
the killer hid, it makes sense.

21:16.575 --> 21:19.643
My biggest thing is my back
to, like, empty spaces.

21:19.645 --> 21:21.378
It's, like,
one of my biggest fears.

21:21.380 --> 21:25.482
Amy, if you want to do something
to try and kick things up,

21:25.484 --> 21:28.318
provoking the idea
of the killer

21:28.320 --> 21:29.787
being in the attic, like,

21:29.789 --> 21:31.822
"How could you do this?
You're nothing," you know?

21:31.824 --> 21:33.590
- Yeah.
- I think that works.

21:33.592 --> 21:34.591
All right,
well, thanks so much.

21:34.593 --> 21:35.459
Yeah, man.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.493
- We appreciate it.
- Yeah.

21:36.495 --> 21:37.828
- You've been awesome.
- Good luck.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.997
- Thank you.
- All right, thank you.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.699
In order to understand
who's haunting this house

21:42.701 --> 21:44.668
and why it would threaten
John Worley,

21:44.670 --> 21:46.336
we would have to
awaken the beast.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.605
And now we have two ways
of doing so.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.707
First, I'm offering
myself as bait

21:50.709 --> 21:53.110
to test if, in fact,
it feeds off fear

21:53.112 --> 21:54.411
by sitting alone
in the attic.

21:54.413 --> 21:57.281
Amy's stationed in the barn
and can only hear my audio

21:57.283 --> 22:01.685
and communicate
via walkie.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.987
Instantly,
I feel creeped out.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.589
My God.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.991
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.961
It's gonna be fine.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.300
Hey, Adam, just,
when you get up there,

22:16.302 --> 22:20.804
make sure all the cameras
are rolling.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.239
<i> Copy that.</i>

22:22.241 --> 22:24.575
To increase
my vulnerability,

22:24.577 --> 22:27.177
there will be no camera crews
in the house with me,

22:27.179 --> 22:29.646
creating an even more
enticing atmosphere

22:29.648 --> 22:31.582
for the dark entity
that's lurking here.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.222
I did not expect my heart
to be racing

22:38.224 --> 22:41.592
as much as it actually is
right now.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.660
He's freaked out.

22:47.132 --> 22:49.233
Okay, I'm in the chair.

22:49.235 --> 22:52.703
He's in the chair.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.339
I'm actually really ****
freaked out right now,

22:55.341 --> 22:57.474
and I don't know why.

22:59.111 --> 23:02.212
My heart is pounding for him.
It's so weird.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.953
I hear movement
to my right.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.760
I have a recorder in my hand.

23:16.762 --> 23:19.062
I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

23:19.064 --> 23:23.600
and I'd like for you to talk
into this recorder, please.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.669
Is there anybody up here?

23:31.510 --> 23:34.344
Can you make a sound
wherever you are?

23:38.317 --> 23:40.918
Something just tapped
the recorder.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.386
I do not feel comfortable
sitting here.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.821
I'm just gonna be --
I do not feel okay.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.825
Okay.

23:48.827 --> 23:52.362
Um, do you know
our friend John?

23:52.364 --> 23:57.434
Someone said something really
bad to him about killing him.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.971
Can you tell me your name?

24:00.973 --> 24:05.042
Did you do something
to this family?

24:05.044 --> 24:10.881
Did you kill
those children?

24:10.883 --> 24:13.784
So, I'm gonna play this back
to see if you talked to me.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.456
<i> Now I think it's working.</i>

24:27.132 --> 24:29.366
"I killed them.
I killed them."

24:29.368 --> 24:31.101
It says, "I killed them."

24:31.103 --> 24:33.203
The weaker you are
as an individual

24:33.205 --> 24:35.172
going into that house,

24:35.174 --> 24:36.239
the more vulnerable you are

24:36.241 --> 24:37.708
and the more activity
that you get.

24:37.710 --> 24:41.311
He was kind of, at points, giddy
about what he was gonna do.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.414
Like
"This is gonna be great."

24:57.930 --> 25:00.163
It's night two
at the Villisca house.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.999
To get answers for John Worley,

25:02.001 --> 25:04.134
we are confronting
the violent entity

25:04.136 --> 25:07.871
who may have killed eight
innocent people in this home.

25:07.873 --> 25:11.041
Adam sits alone in the attic
with a digital recorder

25:11.043 --> 25:14.745
while I listen closely
in the barn out back.

25:14.747 --> 25:19.483
So, I'm gonna play this back
to see if you talked to me.

25:20.786 --> 25:22.953
<i> Now I think it's working.</i>

25:31.163 --> 25:33.463
"I killed them.
I killed them."

25:33.465 --> 25:35.098
It says, "I killed them."

25:35.100 --> 25:38.135
Is there somebody in there?

25:38.137 --> 25:41.571
You said that -- on this
recorder, that you killed them.

25:48.847 --> 25:50.013
Major...

25:51.850 --> 25:54.117
I heard it.

25:57.556 --> 26:02.359
Are you behind me?

26:02.361 --> 26:04.161
All right, you ready?
You can wrap it out.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.530
You just come straight down
into the barn with me.

26:18.777 --> 26:19.810
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.812
So, how was that?

26:21.814 --> 26:24.815
The moment I got in there,
it became real.

26:24.817 --> 26:28.185
I could tell the differences
between investigating alone

26:28.187 --> 26:30.787
in there sitting in that chair
and you and I investigating.

26:30.789 --> 26:31.988
There was a moment
when I was like,

26:31.990 --> 26:32.923
"I don't want to
be here anymore."

26:32.925 --> 26:34.024
Yeah.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.559
And I had to check that
really quickly

26:35.561 --> 26:37.227
because I was like, "No, no, no,
'cause that's what it wants."

26:37.229 --> 26:38.328
Yep.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.198
And I constantly --
I heard movement.

26:44.670 --> 26:47.404
I hear movement
to my right.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.939
And that's when I was like,

26:48.941 --> 26:51.108
"At any moment, something could,
like, jump out at me."

26:51.110 --> 26:52.509
Well, here's the thing.

26:52.511 --> 26:53.510
That was the most activity
we've gotten

26:53.512 --> 26:54.644
since we've been here.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.680
Like, you got clear EVPs
when you were in there.

26:56.682 --> 27:00.350
Right. I will say the weaker
you are as an individual

27:00.352 --> 27:03.353
going into that house,
the more vulnerable you are

27:03.355 --> 27:04.554
and the more activity
that you get.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.356
Like, the second you went
in there,

27:06.358 --> 27:07.824
it was almost like
it woke up.

27:07.826 --> 27:11.228
It was like, "Here's
someone I can mess with."

27:11.230 --> 27:15.265
I would never go in there
alone and provoke.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.366
Mnh-mnh.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.068
Because there is
something in there,

27:18.070 --> 27:19.669
and it is not playing.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.004
That is a dangerous thing.

27:21.006 --> 27:24.708
Johnny said I should
provoke in the attic,

27:24.710 --> 27:28.245
but I think I'll do that
while maybe you're downstairs.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.713
Yeah.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.548
Like, I don't know that I feel
okay doing that by myself.

27:31.550 --> 27:32.983
I would not.

27:32.985 --> 27:36.453
We now have our own evidence
that the ax murderer is here,

27:36.455 --> 27:39.789
and he continues to prey
on vulnerable visitors.

27:39.791 --> 27:42.259
But we were also told
that provoking the entity

27:42.261 --> 27:44.928
will cause it
to respond aggressively.

27:44.930 --> 27:48.231
Agitating evil spirits
is not something I enjoy,

27:48.233 --> 27:50.500
and it can be
extremely dangerous.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.636
But it has to be done
in order to understand

27:52.638 --> 27:54.971
the full scope
of this haunting.

27:54.973 --> 27:57.007
Just heard a noise
in the attic.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.242
I will now face the killer
in the attic

27:59.244 --> 28:01.578
while Adam monitors
the surveillance cameras

28:01.580 --> 28:03.180
from downstairs.

28:05.417 --> 28:08.185
Hello?

28:16.695 --> 28:20.463
This whole place is so creepy.

28:20.465 --> 28:22.465
There's definitely
something here.

28:26.438 --> 28:30.240
Is there someone
in this attic with me?

28:33.745 --> 28:35.645
I think you're
a terrible person.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.248
I hope you're burning
and rotting in hell.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.685
I can't even imagine what
was going through your head

28:41.687 --> 28:43.820
as you sat in this little room

28:43.822 --> 28:49.125
and decided to commit
an atrocious crime.

28:49.127 --> 28:51.027
Preying on weak people
who come in here --

28:51.029 --> 28:55.899
that's gonna stop because
we're on to your little trick.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.235
You find people who are scared.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.670
You find people who are upset,
who are nervous,

29:00.672 --> 29:04.274
who make you mad,
and you prey on them.

29:04.276 --> 29:07.611
That party is over.

29:07.613 --> 29:11.181
No one will ever come
in here weak again.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.117
Let's see.

29:33.972 --> 29:36.673
My God. It says,
"**** you."

29:39.211 --> 29:41.945
Mnh-mnh.

29:44.549 --> 29:47.217
What was done in this room
got somebody to burn in hell.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.419
I don't feel them --
the ones that were killed.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.655
I feel him that did it.

29:51.657 --> 29:54.124
He got off on this.

30:09.007 --> 30:10.707
Amy's in the attic
of the Villisca house

30:10.709 --> 30:12.909
provoking malevolent spirit

30:12.911 --> 30:15.812
while I'm monitoring
from downstairs.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.814
She just got a strong piece
of evidence

30:17.816 --> 30:19.416
that she's speaking
with the killer.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.384
<i>You find people</i>
<i> who are scared.</i>

30:21.386 --> 30:22.986
<i> You find people who are upset,</i>

30:22.988 --> 30:25.155
<i> who are nervous,</i>
<i> who make you mad...</i>

30:30.262 --> 30:32.929
My God.
It says, "**** you."

30:37.803 --> 30:40.770
Well, he's certainly
not happy with me.

30:40.772 --> 30:42.906
I launched into, like,

30:42.908 --> 30:45.809
"You're a disgusting,
filthy human being,"

30:45.811 --> 30:47.911
and he said, "**** you,"
during that recording.

30:47.913 --> 30:49.779
My God.
What?

30:49.781 --> 30:52.449
<i> Is there someone in this</i>
<i> attic with me?</i>

31:03.428 --> 31:05.762
Yeah.
"**** you."

31:05.764 --> 31:08.631
Tonight's investigation
not only provided evidence

31:08.633 --> 31:11.434
of the killer, but that fear
and provocation

31:11.436 --> 31:13.737
sparks his aggressive
activity.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.672
But why is the killer here?

31:15.674 --> 31:18.074
And is he somehow
affecting John?

31:18.076 --> 31:20.443
We brought in psychic medium
Chip Coffey

31:20.445 --> 31:22.112
to help us get answers.

31:22.114 --> 31:26.983
Basically, what we want is
for you to do a walk-through

31:26.985 --> 31:30.820
and just give us
your impressions of the house.

31:30.822 --> 31:31.855
Okay.

31:31.857 --> 31:33.223
Like most in the
paranormal field,

31:33.225 --> 31:35.525
Chip is familiar
with the Villisca murders,

31:35.527 --> 31:38.395
but he's never stepped foot
inside this house.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.664
And he knows nothing
about our investigation.

31:41.666 --> 31:44.667
Mnh-mnh.

31:46.538 --> 31:49.873
What was done in this room
got somebody to burn in hell.

31:49.875 --> 31:53.476
I hear he's a monster.

31:53.478 --> 31:55.412
It's where the two little girls
were killed.

31:55.414 --> 31:59.149
There were two,
yeah, in here.

31:59.151 --> 32:03.453
It's ugly.

32:03.455 --> 32:04.387
I got to get out of here.

32:04.389 --> 32:07.257
- Okay.
- It's just grim.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.325
Mnh.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.634
The surprising thing
is I don't feel them,

32:17.636 --> 32:20.537
the ones that were killed.
I feel him that did it.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.038
Really? Okay.

32:22.040 --> 32:25.074
And it's this...

32:25.076 --> 32:28.711
sick, psycho-sexual,
perverse sense of doing it.

32:28.713 --> 32:29.946
He got off on this.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.080
God.

32:31.082 --> 32:34.284
Yeah.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.586
I don't get anything
from them yet.

32:51.837 --> 32:55.338
He was so unbelievably calm.

32:55.340 --> 33:01.010
He's, like, so unaffected
by what was going to happen.

33:01.012 --> 33:04.881
And I just hear, "I'll wait
as long as it takes."

33:04.883 --> 33:06.416
Did he even know
what he was gonna do?

33:06.418 --> 33:08.651
Yeah.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.688
Yeah.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.389
It was anticipation
of the fact

33:13.391 --> 33:17.160
that he was gonna get some sort
of sick, perverse,

33:17.162 --> 33:21.397
sexual pleasure
out of killing them.

33:21.399 --> 33:23.032
He was kind of, at points,

33:23.034 --> 33:24.934
giddy about what
he was gonna do.

33:24.936 --> 33:28.571
Like
"This is gonna be great."

33:31.676 --> 33:34.177
People have investigated
this place nonstop for 13 years.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.913
So, what's his favorite?
What does he eat up?

33:36.915 --> 33:38.248
Easily manipulated.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.349
- Yeah.
- Easily manipulated.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.450
- Weak.
- Okay, yeah.

33:40.452 --> 33:43.953
- Weak.
- Putty in his hands.

33:43.955 --> 33:46.723
He can affect them.

33:48.059 --> 33:52.996
Does he hang out here
because he still gets that,

33:52.998 --> 33:55.698
like, sick sense
of pleasure

33:55.700 --> 33:58.034
reliving it and hearing
about it all the time?

33:58.036 --> 34:00.270
100%.

34:00.272 --> 34:04.741
And he's backed way off of me
because he knows I'm on to him.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.876
Let's go have a conversation
because we can fill you in.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.678
You will definitely see
some similarities.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.079
Yes.

34:10.081 --> 34:14.817
We'll head into the barn
and have a chat.

34:14.819 --> 34:17.687
The reason why we're here
is because we were called

34:17.688 --> 34:20.156
by an investigator
named John Worley.

34:20.158 --> 34:22.225
He got an EVP here
that was very threatening.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.627
The EVP said,
"Just kill John Worley."

34:24.629 --> 34:26.129
It's very, very clear.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.964
So that would scare anyone.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.831
And he feels as though
ever since

34:29.833 --> 34:32.435
he's had that experience in
the house, he's been cursed.

34:32.437 --> 34:34.603
He won't go back
into the house.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.639
I mean, the things that
went on in that house

34:37.641 --> 34:41.578
were sick and depraved
and powerful.

34:41.580 --> 34:45.047
Well, that, and we met
another person, Buck,

34:45.050 --> 34:47.617
who stabbed himself
in the house.

34:47.619 --> 34:48.284
What?!

34:48.286 --> 34:49.752
He was provoking --

34:49.754 --> 34:53.156
re-created
the entire murder scene.

34:53.158 --> 34:54.556
Think about this.

34:54.559 --> 34:56.225
This guy's
getting off on this.

34:56.226 --> 34:58.861
This guy's like, "

34:58.863 --> 35:00.263
This is wonderful!"

35:00.265 --> 35:03.433
So, Buck came in yesterday,
faced all of his fears,

35:03.435 --> 35:05.969
went in that house,
left a new human being.

35:05.971 --> 35:08.004
And we would like the same
for John Worley.

35:08.006 --> 35:09.872
The thing to remember
about John Worley

35:09.874 --> 35:13.276
is that he is petrified
of this house.

35:13.278 --> 35:16.546
We even had him just on
the porch, looking at the house.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.581
He was shaking.
He was in tears.

35:18.583 --> 35:21.584
So there's two things we'd
love to do with you here.

35:21.586 --> 35:24.087
One, we'd love for you
to walk through the house

35:24.089 --> 35:25.855
with us and him so he
can see that he can

35:25.857 --> 35:27.957
walk in there
and be safe.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.728
We have this theory right now
that when you go in there,

35:31.730 --> 35:34.597
if you are a little afraid
or a little unnerving,

35:34.599 --> 35:35.832
it goes

35:35.834 --> 35:37.000
and it knows immediately.

35:37.002 --> 35:38.001
You're right on.

35:38.003 --> 35:40.870
- Right?
- You're right on. 100%.

35:40.872 --> 35:43.640
So, we have to make sure that
he feels safe and confident.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.975
Now, the second thing
we're hoping for

35:45.977 --> 35:47.944
is for you to do
a reading for him.

35:47.946 --> 35:50.747
If he's somehow cursed
or if this dark entity

35:50.749 --> 35:52.949
is affecting him
in any way,

35:52.951 --> 35:54.550
we think you'll be
able to see it.

35:54.552 --> 35:55.551
Sure.
Absolutely.

35:55.553 --> 35:56.619
Okay, well, let's --

35:56.621 --> 35:57.854
We'll get ready
for John to arrive.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.289
He should be here soon.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.157
There he is!

36:01.159 --> 36:02.325
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, John!

36:02.327 --> 36:03.259
- Good to see you again!
- Welcome back.

36:03.261 --> 36:04.727
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

36:04.729 --> 36:05.895
John, this is Chip Coffey.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.196
Chip Coffey, John.

36:07.198 --> 36:08.131
- Hey, John.
- Hi.

36:08.133 --> 36:09.165
- How are you?
- Thank you.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.466
I'm okay.
Thank you for coming.

36:10.468 --> 36:12.035
- Yeah, sit over here.
- It's good to be here.

36:12.037 --> 36:15.304
So, we've been in the house now
for two nights,

36:15.306 --> 36:17.540
and we brought Chip.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.776
He's one who can tell us
if there is something

36:19.778 --> 36:22.879
kind of on the fringe
or something that might be amiss

36:22.881 --> 36:25.915
because today we would love
for you to kind of walk us

36:25.917 --> 36:28.117
through what you did
when you got that EVP.

36:28.119 --> 36:29.452
You can kind of show us
exactly what happened.

36:29.454 --> 36:30.787
Yeah.

36:30.789 --> 36:34.490
But we would need you
to do so in the house.

36:34.492 --> 36:38.027
How do you feel about
going in?

36:38.029 --> 36:40.229
I said, "I will never
come back here."

36:40.231 --> 36:43.900
I don't feel comfortable
going in the house.

36:43.902 --> 36:45.768
But I do trust you guys.

36:45.770 --> 36:48.004
If you guys say it's safe,

36:48.006 --> 36:51.541
then I will go back
in that house.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.509
I just don't want to be
by myself.

36:53.511 --> 36:55.011
No, we would never
do that to you.

36:55.013 --> 36:55.878
- No.
- No.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.046
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.314
I think the biggest thing
that you need to do

36:58.316 --> 37:00.183
is have that courage
and that, like, confidence

37:00.185 --> 37:02.985
that you're gonna go in here,
nothing bad is gonna happen,

37:02.987 --> 37:04.220
and you're gonna be
matter-of-fact

37:04.222 --> 37:06.989
because your job right now
is to explain to us

37:06.991 --> 37:11.094
in detail what happened to you
and what you were doing.

37:11.096 --> 37:13.162
If you focus on that --
that you're here to do a job

37:13.164 --> 37:14.931
and you have purpose
and you have confidence,

37:14.933 --> 37:17.867
you're gonna be fine.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.635
What's the brother-in-law's
name?

37:19.637 --> 37:22.004
'Cause he's, like,
knocking on the door,

37:22.006 --> 37:26.309
saying, "I want to come in."
And he's here to tell you this.

37:26.311 --> 37:30.146
"Living became difficult,
and dying was the easy part."

37:30.148 --> 37:33.916
I don't know what that means.
Does it make any sense to you?

37:33.918 --> 37:36.219
Yeah.

37:48.333 --> 37:49.832
After a life-threatening message

37:49.834 --> 37:52.835
from the man believed
to have killed eight people,

37:52.837 --> 37:56.472
John vowed never to step inside
the Villisca house again.

37:56.474 --> 37:59.342
But he's put his trust in us
that he will be safe.

37:59.344 --> 38:01.577
Boy, that's a sound I never
thought I'd hear again.

38:01.579 --> 38:03.379
In order to deliver John
from his fear,

38:03.381 --> 38:05.281
we're having him
face this entity

38:05.283 --> 38:08.251
and walk us through the night
of his encounter once more,

38:08.253 --> 38:10.419
while Chip quietly listens in.

38:10.421 --> 38:13.356
He'll be able to sense
if John's truly in danger.

38:13.358 --> 38:15.858
- We go in at 10:00.
- Right.

38:15.860 --> 38:19.061
So, I'm scared,
really scared.

38:19.063 --> 38:22.765
And we got that EVP --
"Just kill John Worley."

38:22.767 --> 38:23.900
- Yeah.
- That's me.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.369
Why did it say it?
I have no idea.

38:26.371 --> 38:28.571
Right before
you got the EVP,

38:28.573 --> 38:30.706
you came in here
freaked out?

38:30.708 --> 38:32.175
Absolutely, yeah.

38:32.177 --> 38:33.209
What did you say
to the killer?

38:33.211 --> 38:34.510
Was it just...?

38:34.512 --> 38:37.547
"Are you tied to the house?"

38:37.549 --> 38:39.315
And he indicated that he was.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.184
Did you do any provoking
at all that night?

38:41.186 --> 38:43.553
No, no! I said nothing
provoking at all.

38:43.555 --> 38:44.821
Okay, all right.
Okay.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.155
- And I don't get it.
- Yeah.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.958
But he did come in not
necessarily strong.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.393
- Yeah.
- We have a handle

38:50.395 --> 38:53.196
on what's happening,
but what we are gonna do --

38:53.198 --> 38:55.131
Chip's gonna give you
a reading.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.333
He will reach out
to some people,

38:57.335 --> 38:59.202
and we think that
will really help you

38:59.204 --> 39:01.237
in this kind of
healing process.

39:01.239 --> 39:03.406
But we needed you, "A,"
to come in here

39:03.408 --> 39:05.107
and show us that, but also,
you needed to come in here

39:05.109 --> 39:07.109
because the biggest thing
is really

39:07.111 --> 39:08.711
you facing that kind of fear.

39:08.713 --> 39:10.446
Even though it's with us,
you know,

39:10.448 --> 39:11.747
at least you came back in here.

39:11.749 --> 39:14.083
All right, let's
go inside the barn,

39:14.085 --> 39:16.485
and we can settle in there
and do a reading.

39:16.487 --> 39:17.386
- Sure.
- Does that work for you?

39:17.388 --> 39:18.988
Absolutely.

39:18.990 --> 39:21.691
Through his reading,
we hope Chip can contact

39:21.693 --> 39:24.727
John's deceased family members
in order to find out

39:24.729 --> 39:29.398
if the killer's spirit
played a hand in their death.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.900
All right.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.501
So, your mother-in-law
and your brother-in-law --

39:32.503 --> 39:35.805
Those two deaths
affected you greatly.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.340
If you wanted to
reach out,

39:37.342 --> 39:39.442
Chip is here for
that kind of thing.

39:39.444 --> 39:41.577
And I'd love to see
if there could be

39:41.579 --> 39:44.280
some kind of healing
in that regard.

39:44.282 --> 39:45.748
What's her name?

39:45.750 --> 39:48.184
Helen.

39:48.186 --> 39:51.921
I like her,
but she's tough.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.523
Can be.

39:54.525 --> 39:59.161
Likes to be in charge.

39:59.163 --> 40:01.397
She wants you to tell your wife
that she loves her.

40:06.271 --> 40:09.071
You didn't do anything.

40:09.073 --> 40:13.743
And she's saying this --
"You didn't do anything.

40:13.745 --> 40:18.681
It was my time to go."

40:18.683 --> 40:19.982
What's the brother-in-law's
name?

40:19.984 --> 40:21.617
'Cause he's, like...

40:21.619 --> 40:23.286
knocking on the door, saying,
"I want to come in."

40:23.288 --> 40:25.521
So say his name so
I can draw him close.

40:25.523 --> 40:27.290
Andy.

40:27.292 --> 40:29.859
Andy's funny,
and he's a smartass sometimes.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.863
He's a little sarcastic
with his wit.

40:33.865 --> 40:36.565
And he's here to tell you this.

40:36.567 --> 40:40.436
"Living became difficult,
and dying was the easy part."

40:40.438 --> 40:44.106
I don't know what that means.
Does it make any sense to you?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.341
Yeah.

40:45.343 --> 40:48.844
You thought you brought
some things upon yourself

40:48.846 --> 40:50.646
and upon those that you love.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.748
I can tell you this.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.550
I don't get anybody
from spirit

40:54.552 --> 40:58.120
who's coming at you and going,
"You caused this!"

40:58.122 --> 41:00.990
And over here
at the ax-murder house,

41:00.992 --> 41:05.227
didn't attach to you and bring
all of this stuff about

41:05.229 --> 41:09.799
as punishment or anything else
for you.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.134
Now it's time to heal your heart
and know they're all right

41:12.136 --> 41:14.937
because I'm hearing
that they are.

41:14.939 --> 41:18.240
I think it was really telling
that as soon as we came in here,

41:18.242 --> 41:20.810
he was not getting any,
like, spirit contact

41:20.812 --> 41:22.845
from anybody saying, like,
they were blaming you.

41:22.847 --> 41:26.449
- No.
- So that's telling.

41:26.451 --> 41:29.552
But there is something here
that seeks out people

41:29.554 --> 41:32.254
who are afraid -- seeks out
people who provoke.

41:32.256 --> 41:36.392
You know, you came in
after being terrified,

41:36.394 --> 41:39.195
and that wakes the beast
in this house.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.797
Overall, it's just
a very valuable lesson

41:41.799 --> 41:45.301
how to be careful, how to
respectfully investigate.

41:45.303 --> 41:49.138
Yeah. I'm very glad
that you can confirm

41:49.140 --> 41:54.844
that I didn't do anything to
cause anything to come back.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.079
I just needed that
peace of mind, though.

41:57.081 --> 42:00.716
And explaining what's going
on here, you helped me.

42:00.718 --> 42:04.286
And thank you.

42:04.288 --> 42:06.689
It's not often that
we come into contact

42:06.691 --> 42:08.591
with something so evil.

42:08.593 --> 42:10.993
This case is a huge
reminder that meddling

42:10.995 --> 42:15.765
with the unknown can be
extremely dangerous.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.533
The tragedy
that took place here

42:17.535 --> 42:19.969
may have left its mark
on this house.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.737
But through
our investigation,

42:21.739 --> 42:24.273
we were able to conclude
it didn't leave its mark

42:24.275 --> 42:25.541
on John Worley.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.411
But for all those
who enter, beware.

42:28.413 --> 42:31.414
No all spirits are
kindred spirits.
