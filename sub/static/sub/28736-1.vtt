What if the carpool
leaves without us?

01:11.005 --> 01:13.005
- Emma honey, I think
we're gonna be okay.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.540
Back me up Sal, we good?

01:14.575 --> 01:15.974
- Right on time.

01:16.010 --> 01:16.942
Can't have these two
running late just because

01:16.977 --> 01:20.045
summer break is only
two weeks away, right?

01:20.081 --> 01:21.413
- Now, is a goodbye
kiss still okay,

01:21.449 --> 01:22.848
or are you girls getting
too big for that?

01:22.883 --> 01:25.050
- We're only to big
for it at school.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.585
- And now we know.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.721
All right, y'all have
a great day, sweetie.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.691
Clay's set to pick you up
after, so look for him, okay?

01:32.726 --> 01:33.959
And I'll see ya later?

01:33.994 --> 01:36.295
- [Both] You sure will.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.064
- What's that all about?

01:39.100 --> 01:40.099
Is something up?

01:40.134 --> 01:41.567
- Why would something be up?

01:41.602 --> 01:42.835
And shouldn't you
be at work by now?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.169

01:44.205 --> 01:45.571

(gentle guitar music)

01:54.548 --> 01:55.781
- Big day, Laurel.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.015
Everything on track?

01:57.051 --> 01:59.017
- Just finishing up
your speech, sir.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.853
- Outstanding, how do I sound?

02:00.888 --> 02:03.655
- Brilliant,
sincere, and modest.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.725
- All my best
qualities (chuckles).

02:06.760 --> 02:08.861
But seriously, thank you.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.395
You know, hiring you
away from Chicago

02:10.431 --> 02:13.966
was one of the best
decisions I ever made.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.400
Is Clay coming to the ceremony?

02:15.436 --> 02:16.969
It's been a while
since I've seen him.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.270
- Well, if he can get away.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.105
You know Clay and
his work schedule,

02:20.141 --> 02:22.241
definitely not bankers' hours.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.309
- Oh, carry on.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.980
(peaceful chiming music)

02:30.384 --> 02:32.217
- Okay, well the venue
has to hold 3,000.

02:32.253 --> 02:35.821
On my night, it was five, will
you check its availability?

02:35.856 --> 02:36.722
Thank you.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.392
All right, well tell them it's
me, they might cut us a deal.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.761
Back-up singers, dancers.

02:42.796 --> 02:46.999
Yeah, yeah no, I'll see you
in New Orleans next month.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.067
Yeah, well I'll eat next week.

02:49.103 --> 02:52.738
All right, Ed I gotta go man,
my biggest star's waiting.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.974
- This new branch of
Cypress Savings and Loan

02:56.010 --> 02:57.209
wouldn't have been possible

02:57.244 --> 03:00.045
without the support of
our entire community,

03:00.080 --> 03:02.548
which is all of you, so
give yourselves a hand.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.384
(audience applauding)

03:05.419 --> 03:08.086
And as with each new
branch that we open,

03:08.122 --> 03:10.989
it isn't really official until
we plant a cypress sapling

03:11.025 --> 03:14.493
grown from the original
cypress that my grandpa grew

03:14.528 --> 03:17.462
on our family farm
over 80 years ago.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.297
- Wow.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.965
- And for all her hard work,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
the honor of
planting this sapling

03:22.036 --> 03:25.170
really should go
to Laurel Couper.

03:25.206 --> 03:25.871
- Me, sir?

03:25.906 --> 03:27.139
- Everyone, won't you join me

03:27.174 --> 03:29.007
in thanking our
newest vice president,

03:29.043 --> 03:31.310
who almost single handedly

03:31.345 --> 03:34.413
made this newest branch
a reality, Laurel Couper.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.548
(audience applauding)
- That wasn't in the speech.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.217
- Go right ahead.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.954
- Well, I am, ah,
practically speechless,

03:41.989 --> 03:44.489
and those of you who know
me know how rare that is.

03:44.525 --> 03:45.224
- Yes.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.525
(audience laughing)

03:46.560 --> 03:48.227
- Let me just say
that I am so proud

03:48.262 --> 03:51.763
to be even a small part of this.

03:51.799 --> 03:52.798
You really want me to?

03:52.833 --> 03:53.632
- Yes.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.501
- All right, here goes.

03:58.973 --> 04:00.172
Declare this latest branch

04:00.207 --> 04:03.742
of Cypress Savings and
Loan officially open.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.944
(audience cheering
and applauding)

04:05.980 --> 04:06.845
Thank you.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.949
Well, look who showed up.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.417
- You did such a
good job, mommy.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.319
- Thank you, baby.

04:14.355 --> 04:17.256
I love looking out in the
crowd and seeing you two.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.190
- Can I take my two girls out

04:18.259 --> 04:19.891
for a little dinner
tonight and celebrate?

04:19.927 --> 04:20.592
- Yeah.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.693
- [Clay] Pick you up at seven?

04:21.729 --> 04:23.528
- Sounds like a plan.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.165
- All right, I know we're
running a little bit late.

04:27.201 --> 04:28.934
You guys mind if we
stop at Graceland?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.102
I have some papers
I need to give them

04:30.137 --> 04:31.169
for an event next week.

04:31.205 --> 04:32.237
- Oh.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.640
- Oh, we don't mind, do we mom?

04:34.675 --> 04:36.174
- Of course not.

04:37.077 --> 04:40.679
(whimsical woodwind music)

04:45.953 --> 04:49.054
- [Emma] Did you know Elvis
was his daddy's middle name?

04:49.089 --> 04:49.988
I heard that in school.

04:50.024 --> 04:51.290
- [Laurel] Is that what
they're teaching you

04:51.325 --> 04:52.891
in music class these days?

04:52.926 --> 04:55.594
- [Clay] All right,
ladies, here we are.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.229
(car door shuts)

04:57.264 --> 04:58.997
Back in a flash.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.732
- Do you know what I like
best about Graceland?

05:00.768 --> 05:01.900
- What?

05:01.935 --> 05:03.468
- It's where we met
Clay last Christmas.

05:03.504 --> 05:07.539
- That's right, what a
holiday treat that was.

05:09.109 --> 05:12.177

05:12.212 --> 05:17.416
♪ Love me tender,
love me sweet ♪

05:19.219 --> 05:21.720
♪ Never let me go

05:21.755 --> 05:24.523
- You know, seeing you
here last Christmas

05:24.558 --> 05:27.159
was one of the best
days of my life.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.361
It started right here.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.799
Actually, you know
what, that's not true.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.768
It started when you
came and sat next to me

05:36.804 --> 05:39.071
in Miss Miller's
third grade class.

05:39.106 --> 05:44.109
- Okay, you two have been acting
strange all day, what's up?

05:44.144 --> 05:45.143
- Clay?
- Yeah.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.079
- Get to the point.
- Right, right, right, right.

05:47.114 --> 05:51.450
The point is, the point is
I lost you once already.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.221
I'm not gonna ever
lose you again.

05:56.256 --> 05:59.157
You know how much I love you.

05:59.193 --> 06:02.227
You know how much I love Emma.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.196
So, Laurel Couper.

06:04.231 --> 06:08.300
♪ Love me tender, love me long

06:10.104 --> 06:11.803
- Will you marry me?

06:12.873 --> 06:13.739

06:15.042 --> 06:17.175
- Will I is not an answer,
it's actually a question.

06:17.211 --> 06:20.212
- Yes, it is, of
course, yes, yes!

06:21.115 --> 06:24.616
(Laurel giggling)
- It fits.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.319
- She said yes!

06:27.354 --> 06:28.086
- Oh, my goodness.

- Oh, let me see, let me see.

06:45.139 --> 06:46.405
- Oh, look.
- Nice.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.241
- That is the most
beautiful thing I have seen

06:49.276 --> 06:50.575
since Ted proposed to me.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.276
- Oh, you.

- And you, mister, how long
have you been planning this?

06:58.385 --> 07:02.120

- There's a wedding!

07:05.559 --> 07:07.459

only one place.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.699
- [Laurel And Clay]
Graceland Chapel.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.967
- [Ted] All right.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.502
- Oh my God, yeah!

07:19.306 --> 07:20.405
- Love you.

07:20.474 --> 07:23.608
- So, when are you gonna
tell your folks the big news?

07:23.644 --> 07:25.911

07:28.248 --> 07:28.914

- [Tyler] Clay, what's wrong?

07:30.651 --> 07:31.850
It's late, something's wrong.

07:31.885 --> 07:32.984

07:33.020 --> 07:34.286
- Trish, something's wrong.
- Dad?

07:34.321 --> 07:35.153
Nothing's wrong, it's
actually the opposite.

07:35.189 --> 07:35.887
Laurel and I--

07:35.923 --> 07:36.922
- [Trish] Give me that.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.857
Hey, Clay, it's your mama.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.091
- I know, I can see you.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.726
- [Trish] You and Laurel what?

07:41.762 --> 07:44.029
- Laurel and I are, well.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.532
We're getting married.

- [Trish] Oh, honey,
I'm so excited.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.282
We gotta hang up, we
gotta call the family.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.617
How do you make it--
- Wait, wait, wait, Mom?

08:05.652 --> 08:06.852
- [Trish] Make it?

08:06.887 --> 08:09.488
- Mom?
(Laurel chuckling)

08:09.523 --> 08:11.690
Okay, bye, that was a good talk.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.226
- Well, they're excited.

(computer beeping)

08:24.972 --> 08:26.505
Hello, daddy?

how's the bank opening go?

08:29.109 --> 08:30.275
- Oh, it was great.

08:30.310 --> 08:34.346
Mr. Franklin actually had me
plant the tree, well partially.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.514
I'll send you a photo.

08:35.549 --> 08:38.016
I have got some big news.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.384
- [Laurel's Dad] I'm listening.

08:39.419 --> 08:43.255
- So, Clay and I, we've
been making some plans.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.756
- [Laurel's Dad] I hope
you're not planning

08:44.791 --> 08:45.991
to go on the road again.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.059
You just got this new
position at the bank.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.462
- No, daddy, we're
not going on tour.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.897
Different news.

08:51.932 --> 08:56.434
So, Clay proposed and we're
getting married (shrieks).

08:56.470 --> 08:59.571
- [Laurel's Dad]
Well, that is news.

08:59.606 --> 09:02.474
Congratulations, honey.

09:02.509 --> 09:03.909
That's just fine.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.578
- Fine?

09:06.613 --> 09:09.948
- [Laurel's Dad]
Really, really fine.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.187
- [Laurel] I can't believe
we're actually getting married.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.389
My head's still spinning.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.958
- Laurel Couper, you're not
having second thoughts, are you?

09:19.993 --> 09:21.426
- Goodness, no.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.462
Just taking it all in.

09:24.498 --> 09:27.699
I do wish my dad would've
been a little bit more--

09:27.734 --> 09:28.667
- Excited for us?

09:28.702 --> 09:30.268
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.404
- Well, we did kind of
spring it on him, so.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.939
- We took your
parents by surprise,

09:33.974 --> 09:36.641
and they did everything
but call the local news.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.277
- I wouldn't put it past them.

09:39.313 --> 09:42.280
Listen, your dad's
gonna come around, okay.

09:42.316 --> 09:44.082
Especially when he
sees how happy you are.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.450
- You're right, you're right.

09:45.485 --> 09:46.451
- I am right.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.286
- I'm overthinking this.

09:48.322 --> 09:51.623
It has to be here, I mean,
Graceland's our good luck charm.

09:51.658 --> 09:52.457
- Yes it is.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.426
- Laurel Couper.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.126
- Hey.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.829
- It's so good to see you both.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.799
Hey Clay.
- How are you?

10:01.835 --> 10:03.468
- Congratulations
on your promotion.

10:03.503 --> 10:04.903
- Thank you.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.639
I'm now the official events
coordinator at Graceland.

10:07.674 --> 10:08.640
- That's fantastic.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.709
- So, you're tying the knot.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.410
- We sure are.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.145
- When I got the message,
I checked our books,

10:14.181 --> 10:18.016
and there is an availability,
- Yeah?

10:18.051 --> 10:19.517
- A year from August.

10:19.553 --> 10:20.919
- Oh, a year.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.722
- As you can imagine, we
have to book way in advance.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.257
Everyone wants to get
married at Graceland.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.760
But if you don't need
that much time to plan,

10:28.795 --> 10:30.395
we just had a cancellation.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.997
There's an opening June 1st.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.698
- I've always dreamed
of a June wedding.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.899
- Yeah.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.267
- That still means
waiting a year.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.403
- No, no, no, no,
no, this June 1st.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.805
- Oh, three weeks from
now, that June 1st?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.140
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.975
Hmm.
- That's amazing.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.378
- And soon.
- Yeah.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.979
- Oh, I'm sorry.

10:48.015 --> 10:48.980
This will be real quick.

10:49.016 --> 10:49.948
Go on, take a look inside.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.683
- Okay.
- Thank you.

10:52.653 --> 10:53.585
- June 1st?

10:56.356 --> 10:59.090
Well, this sure is what we want.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.292
Wow, three weeks.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.029
- Yeah, is that enough
time to pull this off?

11:04.064 --> 11:06.498
- We can keep things simple.

11:06.533 --> 11:09.300
You know, just family, friends.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.970
I don't need anything fancy.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.073
Besides, you know what they say.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.876
- That depends on who "they" is.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.445
- Well, Elvis for one.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.946
It's now or never.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.850
- Can I assume that's a yes?

11:28.422 --> 11:31.623
- And it's set back in the
woods with big glass windows,

11:31.658 --> 11:33.391
so you can see outside.

11:33.427 --> 11:36.661
It's just the cutest
little chapel ever.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.596
How are you feeling
about all this?

11:38.632 --> 11:39.764
- Amazing.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.566
You know, the best part is?
- What?

11:41.601 --> 11:43.601
- Instead of Clay coming
over Sunday mornings

11:43.637 --> 11:47.338
to make pecan pancakes,
he'll make them everyday.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.107
- Well, I'm not
sure about everyday,

11:49.142 --> 11:50.241
but we will definitely
have to come up

11:50.277 --> 11:52.711
with our own little family
traditions like that too.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.513
- Like, family dinners
together every night?

11:55.549 --> 11:59.384
- And more music in this
house if that's even possible.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.652
Now, there's gonna be
a whole lot of planning

12:00.687 --> 12:02.587
to do for the wedding.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.556
Flowers to choose,
cakes to taste.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.324
- Mmm.
- Dresses to pick out.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.227
And I'm gonna need your
advice every step of the way.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.228
Are you up for it?

12:10.263 --> 12:12.197
- Of course, mom, I can't wait.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.231
- Well, you won't
have to wait long,

12:13.266 --> 12:14.966
it's only three weeks away.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.235
Which reminds me, I
need to make a call.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.870
- I love you, mommy, you know.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.406
- I love you too, you know.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.776
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, hon.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.513
- [Laurel's Dad] But don't you
think it's a little rushed?

12:28.548 --> 12:30.982
I mean, you've only been
back in Memphis five months.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.784
- Well, it's only time that
we could get the chapel

12:32.819 --> 12:34.686
without having to wait a year.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.988
- It's a very popular
place to get married.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.823
Daddy, I've known Clay
since we were kids.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.593
If anything, we've taken
slower than molasses.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.896
- But, a June wedding?
- June? That's awfully quick.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.064
- That's why I'm telling you now

12:46.099 --> 12:48.066
so that you and
Isabelle can make plans.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.702
There's no way that I'm
doing this without y'all.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.104
- Now you know the only
thing that I've ever wanted

12:53.140 --> 12:54.372
is what's best for you.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.908
And if you believe that
that's Clay Sheppard--

12:56.943 --> 12:57.776
- It is.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.578
- Then we'll be there.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.213
- That's all I needed to hear.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.450
All right, I gotta go, I have
a wedding to pull together.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.752
I love you, daddy.
- I love you.

13:07.788 --> 13:08.653
Bye.

13:12.826 --> 13:16.828
- So, here are some ideas
I have for the invitations.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.363
- Classy.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.130
Fun.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.765
(chuckling)

13:20.801 --> 13:22.667
Is that a catfish in a tux?

13:22.702 --> 13:23.902
- Ignore that, I was
just playing around.

13:23.937 --> 13:29.474
But, I do have the Save the
Date email and the invitation.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.676
- These are so great,
I love them all.

13:31.711 --> 13:32.477
- Thank you.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.145
- Well, except
maybe the catfish.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.748
Seriously, don't go crazy if
you've got other work to do.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.650
- Are you kidding me,
for my best friend?

13:38.685 --> 13:40.218
Look, try and stop me.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.921
And besides, I work
well under pressure.

13:42.956 --> 13:46.224
(phone dinging)

13:46.259 --> 13:47.325
- What?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.827
- Everything okay?

13:48.862 --> 13:51.696
- My dad just sent me
his flight information.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.565
Him and Isabelle
are coming in early.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.499
- How early?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.634
- The day after tomorrow early.

13:56.670 --> 14:00.839
- Well, I hope you work
well under pressure, too.

14:02.642 --> 14:05.043
- These are great.
- Aren't they?

14:05.078 --> 14:06.511
- [Clay] Yeah,
especially like this one.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.478
- I also booked a
couple of suites

14:07.514 --> 14:10.215
at the Graceland Guest
House for our folks.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.283
Right across the
hall from each other.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.652
- Thank you very much
for taking care of that.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.222
Okay, well, I love
these, fantastic.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.891
- Not a catfish on any of them.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.559
Private joke.

14:21.595 --> 14:23.828
- Well, oh so tomorrow
after sound check,

14:23.864 --> 14:24.963
we should get our
marriage license,

14:25.065 --> 14:29.000
and we still need a minister,
a band for the reception.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.436
The caterer, I made
a little to-do list.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.537
- Is that all?

14:32.572 --> 14:35.874
- Good morning, can I get
you something to drink?

14:35.909 --> 14:37.108
- Sweet tea for me, please.

14:37.143 --> 14:39.611
- And I'll have the
same as my fiance.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.479
- Two fiance specials coming up.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.148
And congratulations,
when's the big day?

14:44.184 --> 14:45.884
- June 1st.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.252
- Just around the corner.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.820
How do you two look so relaxed?

14:48.855 --> 14:51.956
- Would you believe we
just started planning?

14:51.992 --> 14:53.091
- Just started?

14:53.126 --> 14:54.726
Well, honey, you
let me know if I can

14:54.761 --> 14:56.160
get you anything stronger.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.595
- Thank you.

14:57.631 --> 15:00.832
So, how is the concert in
New Orleans shaping up?

15:00.867 --> 15:02.867
- Typical issues,
nothing I can't fix.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.469
Fortunately, we have
a little bit of time

15:04.504 --> 15:07.071
before the relatives get here.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.242
- About that, my
dad and Isabelle,

15:12.345 --> 15:14.846
they're flying in
early to "help."

15:14.881 --> 15:16.981
- Okay, but not next week?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.683
- Oh no, no, no.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.919
More like the day
after tomorrow.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.021
He thinks we need
all hands on deck,

15:23.056 --> 15:25.890
so I figured we should
probably invite your parents

15:25.926 --> 15:27.825
to come in too.

15:27.861 --> 15:28.893
- Are you sure?

15:28.929 --> 15:31.095
- Well yeah, I don't want
them to feel excluded.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.664
Plus, your mom already
thinks I'm the girl

15:32.699 --> 15:34.766
that broke her son's
heart 10 years ago.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.734
- And your dad still thinks
I sing on street corners

15:36.770 --> 15:38.703
with an opened guitar case.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.738
- He's just not
that big on music.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.173
- Well, your dad is who he is.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.342
I remember when I would pick
you up on dates in high school,

15:44.377 --> 15:46.477
he would make me file
in line like I was under

15:46.513 --> 15:48.713
some kind of inspection.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.149
- Well, he's not called
the Major for nothing.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.116
- Well, maybe he's mellowed out.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.618
Wait, what's your stepmom like?

15:53.653 --> 15:54.719
- Isabelle?
- Mm-hmm.

15:54.788 --> 15:58.823
- She's refined, traditional,
a little intimidating.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.826
- Okay, so she and
my mom would be like,

16:01.861 --> 16:03.161
what would you say?

16:03.196 --> 16:05.630
- Oil and water?
- Oh.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.732
- You hear that?
- No, what?

16:07.767 --> 16:12.170
- The sound of two runaway
trains headed our way.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.310
- Young lady, there seems
to be a little mix up,

16:19.346 --> 16:21.312
there's a piano in our room.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.347
- Yes.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.815
- We don't play.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.717
- Sir, that's part
of the luxury suite.

16:25.752 --> 16:26.451
- Oh.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.019
- Daddy, Isabelle.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.487
- There they are.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.690
- Good to see you.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.959
- This cannot be Emma.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.127
- It's me, grandpa.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.930
- You are so big, look at you.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.532
- Mr. Couper, good
to see you, sir.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.334
- Oh, you don't have
to call me, Mr. Couper.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.035
- No?

16:44.070 --> 16:46.537
- The Major will do just fine.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.240
Emma, we got a present for you.

16:51.077 --> 16:52.176
- Nice.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.513
- Whoa, a savings bond.

16:56.983 --> 17:00.385
- Never too soon to start
preparing for your future.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.120
Who knows, maybe
someday you'll follow

17:02.155 --> 17:03.888
in your mom's footsteps.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.189
- And be a singer too?

17:05.225 --> 17:08.760
- I meant the vice
president of a bank.

17:08.795 --> 17:12.397
- Thank you, I really,
really like it.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.867
- Hey, treat her gentle,
she's been through a lot.

17:15.902 --> 17:18.002
Talking about the
car, not the wife.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.904
- He makes that joke every time.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.840
- Never gets old.
- And neither do I.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.043
- Mom.
- Hiya, honey.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.844
- Well, well, welcoming party.

17:26.880 --> 17:27.912
What, no balloons?

17:27.947 --> 17:28.846
Laurel.
- Hey.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.249
- Great to have you
home where you belong.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.818
- Well you know what they say,
"Home is where the heart is."

17:33.853 --> 17:34.519
- Well, let's just
hope your heart

17:34.554 --> 17:37.221
stays here for good this time.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.992
- Tyler and Trish, this
is my father, the Major,

17:41.027 --> 17:42.693
and my stepmother, Isabelle.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.030
- Well hey, Major is
that a name or a rank?

17:46.066 --> 17:47.565
- Both, these days.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.033
- And this is my daughter, Emma.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.968
- Emma, come here, I'm a hugger.

17:51.004 --> 17:53.538
Oh, aren't you just
the prettiest thing.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.405
- Thank you, ma'am.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.306
- Ma'am?

17:56.276 --> 17:58.709
I do not see any
ma'ams around here.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.211
You call me Trish, you hear?

18:00.246 --> 18:01.746
- Yes, ma'am, I mean Trish.

18:01.781 --> 18:05.650
- Hey, and we got a little
something for you, darling.

18:05.685 --> 18:10.021
- A teddy bear, oh my
gosh, mom it's so cute.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.623
- That is Wedding Elvis.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.926
- "Thank you very much."

18:14.961 --> 18:16.194
- Let me get you
guys checked in.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.328
- Okay.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.496
- Major, did I hear
you were stationed

18:18.531 --> 18:19.964
at the base in Jackson?

18:19.999 --> 18:21.899
- I was, retired now.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.935
I'm stationed in Scottsdale.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.770
- Although for
him, retired means

18:25.805 --> 18:29.240
jogging five miles every morning
and remodeling the house.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.943
- So Clay, now that
you're getting married,

18:31.978 --> 18:33.945
what's next for you?

18:33.980 --> 18:37.014
- Yes sir, I have several
big shows coming this summer.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.950
I have--
- I meant long term.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.818
You know, an actual career.

18:40.854 --> 18:43.988
- You all must be so
exhausted from your trip.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.156
Maybe a nap?

18:45.191 --> 18:46.691
- Hey, once we get
settled, we need

18:46.726 --> 18:48.426
to start planning the big day.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.660
How about a get-together
here tomorrow,

18:49.696 --> 18:51.062
we'll kick around some ideas?

18:51.097 --> 18:52.997
- Strategy session,
good idea, Sheppard.

18:53.032 --> 18:54.599
- We have so many
decisions to make.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.334
Is that good for you, Laurel?

18:56.369 --> 18:59.303
- How about my house after
work, I could fix us a bite?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.806
- Oh, don't you worry about
food, I'll whip something up.

19:01.841 --> 19:02.907
- I can bring some finger foods.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.510
- Oh, no need, I already
got the menu all planned.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.044
- But, we just decided.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.114
- Honey, it is a long drive
from Mid-East Tennessee,

19:10.150 --> 19:11.182
I needed something
to pass the time.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.017
Can y'all believe that
we're gonna have a wedding

19:13.052 --> 19:15.186
in two and a half weeks?

19:15.221 --> 19:16.120
Tyler, get a photo.

19:16.156 --> 19:16.888
- Yes, ma'am, here we go.

19:16.990 --> 19:17.989
Everybody in tight.
- Come on in.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.790
Here we go, get everybody.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.726
- One, Major, smile.

19:21.761 --> 19:22.727
Two, three.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.700
- And if you'll sign here.
- Yep.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.469
- And here.
- Mm-hmm.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.205
- One more right here.

19:36.176 --> 19:39.310
- Now, that is a beautiful ring.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.646
And I was wondering when
Clay was going to get around

19:41.681 --> 19:43.814
to finally popping the question.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.183
It is Clay, isn't it?

19:45.218 --> 19:48.686
- Of course, but I promise
it won't impact my work.

19:48.721 --> 19:49.954
- You don't have
to tell me that.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.089
I have the utmost faith in you.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.525
- Thank you, that
means so much to me.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.862
Clay is emailing our Save
The Dates this morning.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.363
June 1st.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.498
- That soon?

20:00.533 --> 20:01.999
- I hope you and
Glenda can make it.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.969
- Well, you just
try to keep us away.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.104
How's the wedding
planning going?

20:07.140 --> 20:09.307
- Well, two servings
of pretty good

20:09.342 --> 20:11.943
with a side order of panic.

20:11.978 --> 20:16.113
- Well, if there's anything I
can do, you just let me know.

20:16.149 --> 20:18.516
- Well, there actually is.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.453
If you could sign right here.
- Okay.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.422
Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.794
Now this is what I
call perfect timing.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.495
- She said to be
here on the dot.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.363
- Me too.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.900
(sighing) Is that
your momma's cooking?

20:35.935 --> 20:37.401
Smells good.

20:37.437 --> 20:42.106
- Give her a barbecue pit and
a few hours and magic happens.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.874
- Surprise!

20:43.910 --> 20:45.876
- Oh my, what is all this?

20:45.912 --> 20:48.079
- We decided to throw
you a pounding party.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.880
- We expected a
strategy session.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.851
- We did, too, but apparently
Trish had other ideas.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.086
- Are you surprised, mom?

20:55.121 --> 20:56.754
- I sure am.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.089
What's a pounding party?

20:58.124 --> 20:59.690
- Don't tell me you've
been gone so long

20:59.726 --> 21:01.559
you've forgotten all
your Southern traditions.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.595
- I confess, I had no idea
what a pounding party was.

21:04.631 --> 21:07.131
- When a couple gets
married, friends and family

21:07.166 --> 21:09.066
get together and bring
all kinds of things

21:09.102 --> 21:10.568
to outfit the kitchen.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.802
- That's sweet.
- Yep.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.037
- There's more gifts
in the dining room.

21:13.106 --> 21:16.407
- Yeah, just a few necessities
that we saw you were missing.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.743
- In keeping with tradition,

21:18.778 --> 21:21.045
we picked this up
for you as well.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.147
An essential for every kitchen.

21:23.182 --> 21:27.018
- Thank you, Isabelle,
you shouldn't have.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.155
You really shouldn't have.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.690
- It's an avocado slicer.

21:32.725 --> 21:33.791
- Oh.

21:33.826 --> 21:34.925
- I've got one of those,
I call it a knife.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.728
- It's great, it's great,
we love making guacamole.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.130
Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.299
- Oh, and Tyler
and I got you this.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.834
We got you a pound of
flour, and a pound of sugar,

21:43.870 --> 21:46.203
and eggs, and milk,
and a pan to mix it in.

21:46.239 --> 21:47.371
- Oh.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.273
- That's why you call
it a pounding party.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.809
- Clever, thank y'all, thanks.

21:53.046 --> 21:56.280
- Oh, and son, since
you're getting married,

21:56.316 --> 21:58.349
you're gonna need this.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.018
- Bourbon?

22:01.054 --> 22:02.520
- It's an old tradition to
bury a bottle at the venue

22:02.555 --> 22:05.089
to ward off any rain
on the wedding day.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.124
- Fascinating, I
did not know that.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.127
- My wife knows just about
every Southern tradition.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.596
Stick around, you
may learn something.

22:12.632 --> 22:13.898
- So who's hungry?

22:13.933 --> 22:16.400
I've got brisket, and
chicken, and ribs.

22:16.436 --> 22:19.203
- Oh it looks delicious,
but I have to pass.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.738
I'm pescatarian.

22:22.275 --> 22:23.474
- Pesca-what?

22:24.143 --> 22:27.278
- The only meat I eat is fish.

22:27.313 --> 22:28.446
- Oh.

22:28.481 --> 22:31.649
- Don't worry about me,
everyone, I'll be fine.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.218
- Well, let me take that
from you, Laurel, honey

22:34.253 --> 22:35.386
- Thanks.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.289
- Laurel, can you come
help me in the kitchen?

22:38.324 --> 22:39.190
- Sure.

22:41.994 --> 22:45.996
Oh, red velvet cupcakes,
would you look at that?

22:46.032 --> 22:47.565
Don't tell me you
made these today.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.801
- Well then I won't, but I did.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.703
These are my son's favorites.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.239
I make a tower like
this for every birthday.

22:55.274 --> 22:57.975
- I thought his favorite
dessert was pecan pie.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.344
- Oh no, red velvet tower.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.380
Clay's heart's delight.

23:03.649 --> 23:06.283
But be careful, it's fragile.

23:07.286 --> 23:11.122
And I'm not talking
about the cupcake, honey.

23:11.157 --> 23:14.759
(curious percussion music)

23:22.067 --> 23:23.801
Major, you wanted the table?

23:23.836 --> 23:26.203
- All right, let's
get down to brass tax.

23:26.239 --> 23:27.471
Now, this wedding
is two weeks away,

23:27.507 --> 23:29.907
so I took the liberty
of creating a schedule.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.642
Everyone knows that
most battles are won

23:31.677 --> 23:33.310
before they're fought.

23:33.346 --> 23:34.512
- It's a military thing.

23:34.547 --> 23:37.615
- Though it's a
wedding, not a war.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.218
- Look at all the colors.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.687
- Well, this is something,
isn't this something, Clay?

23:43.723 --> 23:44.889
- [Clay] It's
something all right.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.791
- What we have
here is a timeline.

23:46.826 --> 23:50.528
It starts on today and runs
through the day of the wedding.

23:50.563 --> 23:54.799
I've broken it down into
days, tasks, and events.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.268
- How festive.

23:57.370 --> 23:59.904
But I always say it's best to
just take one step at a time.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.239
So let's start with
the guest list.

24:02.275 --> 24:05.476
So I have Clay's sisters
and their hubbies and kids.

24:05.511 --> 24:08.078
And the cousins, first,
second, and third.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.513
And our friends and neighbors.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.482
- Mom, you have like
50 people on this list.

24:11.517 --> 24:12.950
- That's just the first page.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.319
- Well I think what
Clay means is that given

24:15.354 --> 24:17.421
the tight schedule,
we think it'd be best

24:17.457 --> 24:19.323
to limit 12 guests each.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.826
- I have to say,
that seems sensible.

24:21.861 --> 24:25.696
- And if I might suggest
a formal wedding.

24:25.731 --> 24:28.466
Men in tuxedos, ladies
in evening gowns.

24:28.501 --> 24:29.733
- Formal?

24:29.769 --> 24:31.101
When Tyler and I got married,

24:31.137 --> 24:34.138
all the ladies wore
big silk flower hats.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.272
It's a party, after all.

24:35.308 --> 24:38.342
- Of course, it is a wedding
not the Kentucky Derby.

24:38.377 --> 24:39.643
- Dad?

24:39.679 --> 24:40.578
- Our neighbor's getting
married at the Kentucky Derby.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.046
- And it was lovely.

24:42.081 --> 24:45.282
Wouldn't be a shame to go
small on such a big day?

24:45.318 --> 24:46.517
Don't you think, Laurel?

24:46.552 --> 24:49.420
- But tradition never
goes out of style,

24:49.455 --> 24:50.855
isn't that right, Laurel?

24:50.890 --> 24:54.658
Maybe the bride should
decide whose idea is better.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.261
- I think the all
the ideas are great.

24:57.296 --> 24:58.796
I can't decide right now.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.365
- Well, honey, you take your
time and give it some thought.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.000
It's your big day, after all.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.236
We don't want to impose
our ideas on you.

25:05.271 --> 25:06.403
- I think one thing
we can all agree on,

25:06.472 --> 25:09.073
is we have a lot to do with
a very short timeframe, so--

25:09.108 --> 25:11.108
- So, back to my chart.
(doorbell ringing)

25:11.143 --> 25:13.811
- She's here, right on time.

25:13.846 --> 25:14.979
- She?

25:15.014 --> 25:16.247
- Major, I don't think
we're gonna need this.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.382
Tyler and I saved the
big news for last.

25:18.417 --> 25:21.452
We got y'all an early
wedding present.

25:21.487 --> 25:22.786
- [Tyler] Tah-dah!

25:22.822 --> 25:24.555
- Hello, everyone.

25:25.458 --> 25:26.357
- Hello.

25:26.392 --> 25:27.925
- You must be Laurel.
- I am.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.060
- Congratulations
to the both of you.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.161
- Thank you.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.663
- I'm Allie Monroe,
and may I say,

25:32.698 --> 25:34.265
it's such a pleasure.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.368
- Allie is one of the
top wedding planners

25:37.403 --> 25:39.303
in all of Tennessee.

25:39.338 --> 25:44.642
- I've brought along photos of
my work for inspiration, yes.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.644
Let's just get this
out of the way.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.779
You can set that there, perfect.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.615
Now, I know we have a
million things to cover,

25:51.651 --> 25:54.151
including seeing the venue.

25:54.186 --> 25:57.021
- Okay, we can call
Kathy on Monday.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.924
- Oh, no need, I've already
made an appointment.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.626
Tomorrow morning, 9 a.m. sharp.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.463
- Okay, sounds good.

26:12.705 --> 26:12.736
- This space is lovely.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.810
What a dream I can
create for you.

26:19.845 --> 26:23.781
I see gold aisle runners with
enormous cymbidium orchids

26:23.816 --> 26:27.818
in mercury-glass vases
wrapped in gold tool.

26:27.853 --> 26:31.188
Votive candles on each
pedestal lining the way.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.023
Are you taking notes?

26:34.193 --> 26:35.926
Ms. Monroe, Allie?

26:37.597 --> 26:41.098
Clay and I were just,
we were thinking.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.567
It's nothing, never mind.

26:43.603 --> 26:47.871
- Honey, we were just
thinking just wildflowers.

26:48.874 --> 26:51.475
- (laughing) "Wildflowers."

26:51.510 --> 26:55.045
You have a sense of humor,
I like that in a client.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.313
- Did Clay say something funny?

26:56.349 --> 27:00.351
- Oh, honey let's just
give Allie a chance.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.052
- Are you sure about this?

27:02.088 --> 27:03.921
- Well, what can I do?

27:03.956 --> 27:07.191
It's a gift from your mom, I
don't want to seem ungrateful.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.292
- I know.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.627
- Let's just hear
what she has in mind.

27:09.662 --> 27:10.928
- Good.

27:10.963 --> 27:15.132
- And here, a canopy of
cherry blossoms with crystals.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.803
- Oh, I love that.

27:21.607 --> 27:24.575
- I'm with you, I'm with you.

27:24.610 --> 27:26.143
- Yay.
- Woo-hoo.

27:28.114 --> 27:33.350
- Okay, that's enough flower
girl practice for now.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.152
How are the invitations
coming along?

27:35.187 --> 27:36.920
- Good, we're almost done.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.189
It would've been
easier to email them.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.492
- And somehow, I don't think
Isabelle would approve.

27:41.527 --> 27:44.028
- Hey mom, can I go over
and play at Lanie's?

27:44.063 --> 27:47.031
- Sure, just leave
the petals outside.

27:47.066 --> 27:47.965
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.733
- You know, I think
I'm gonna go monitor

27:49.769 --> 27:50.934
some of that flower power.

27:51.003 --> 27:54.938
- I'll come with you, I've got
wedding programs to design.

27:54.974 --> 27:57.908
- Thank y'all for y'all help.
- See you later.

27:57.943 --> 28:02.212
- Well, no need to send me
an invitation, I'll be there.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.648
In spite of what your
mom seems to think.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.850
One thing's for sure,
if we're all gonna be

28:06.886 --> 28:09.853
one big, happy family
we got a long way to go.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.922
- You are not kidding.

28:11.957 --> 28:13.991
- What if we take
the initiative?

28:14.026 --> 28:15.959
iI host a girls' day out,

28:15.995 --> 28:17.594
and you have a day
out with the guys,

28:17.630 --> 28:21.231
and we can get everybody to
talk and maybe compromise.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.966
- Yeah, maybe we can get one
of them to talk to Allie,

28:23.002 --> 28:25.936
and get her to tone
things down a little.

28:25.971 --> 28:26.837
Or a lot.

28:28.541 --> 28:33.010
Hey, we're gonna get
through this, together.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.512
- You're right, together
we can handle anything,

28:35.548 --> 28:37.214
even our parents.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.616
- What?

28:39.652 --> 28:42.119
- Well, I thought if I said
it out loud, I might buy it.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.221
It didn't work.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.089
- No.

28:51.597 --> 28:55.365
- Oh, a day spa, this is
such a lovely idea, Laurel.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.569
- I agree, it's a
delightful idea.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.938
- You agree, this day
is working out already.

29:00.973 --> 29:04.608
- Well honey, it isn't work
when you're having fun.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.877
- It's so good of you
both to be here for us.

29:06.912 --> 29:10.013
I mean, Clay and I couldn't
do this without y'all.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.348
- We're happy to help.

29:11.383 --> 29:14.518
- Speaking of which, Allie
gave us some homework.

29:14.553 --> 29:18.388
She flagged some cake and design
ideas for us to check out.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.924
- Allie sure has a lot of ideas.

29:20.960 --> 29:21.859
Maybe we can talk about that?

29:21.894 --> 29:23.627
- You know, when Tyler
and I got married,

29:23.662 --> 29:26.830
we had 300 guests, we
had four live music acts,

29:26.866 --> 29:29.733
and folks flew in
from everywhere.

29:29.769 --> 29:30.901
How about you Isabelle?

29:30.970 --> 29:35.105
- Well, the Major and I had
a simple ceremony last year.

29:35.141 --> 29:39.143
Traditional, tasteful,
we didn't want to fuss.

29:39.178 --> 29:42.079
- Is the whole point of a
wedding is to make a fuss?

29:42.114 --> 29:45.716
- Oh, would you look at this
article on wedding cakes.

29:45.751 --> 29:48.185
- Look at that, that
is a five-tiered peach

29:48.220 --> 29:52.089
with Bourbon and
pecan frosting, yum.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.524
You know what'd be cute?

29:53.559 --> 29:54.892
If we had a groom with a guitar

29:54.927 --> 29:57.427
and a bride with a
microphone on top.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.662
- That's an idea.

29:58.697 --> 30:01.064
- Isn't this lovely,
vanilla buttercream.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.100
- Classics never
go out of style.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.768
(phone buzzing)
- Oh it's the hotel.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.336
We're trying to switch rooms.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.272
The guests across the
hall were playing music

30:08.307 --> 30:11.208
until all hours last night.

30:11.243 --> 30:14.611
- I am so sorry,
were we too loud?

30:14.647 --> 30:17.281
- Hello, yes this
is Mrs. Couper.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.283
- You know, I am so
glad you and Clay

30:19.318 --> 30:21.118
found each other again.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.687
- That means so much to me.

30:23.722 --> 30:26.190
- Well you know when
you left for Chicago,

30:26.225 --> 30:27.791
he took it real hard.

30:27.827 --> 30:29.726
He really missed you.

30:29.762 --> 30:33.063
Can you blame him,
you leaving like that?

30:33.098 --> 30:36.133
- Trish, that
won't happen again.

30:36.168 --> 30:40.103
Cross my heart, Clay and
I are together for life.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.739
- That's what a
mother wants to hear.

30:42.775 --> 30:45.542
Which is why you deserve a
wedding you're gonna remember

30:45.578 --> 30:47.044
for a lifetime.

30:47.079 --> 30:49.079
You don't want some
small ceremony that's

30:49.114 --> 30:50.948
over and done in an hour.

30:50.983 --> 30:55.853
You stick with me, girl, we're
gonna do this thing right.

30:55.888 --> 30:58.355
- You think doves are too much?

30:58.390 --> 30:59.256
- Well--

30:59.291 --> 31:02.292
- Me neither, I'll
talk to Allie about it.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.228
I just love that cake.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.798
- Okay boys, Major
and I are dormy,

31:07.833 --> 31:09.132
two up with two to play.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.834
The pressure is on.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.769
You okay, son, this is the
worst I've seen you play

31:12.805 --> 31:13.937
since you were 10.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.239
- Yeah, if I didn't
know any better,

31:15.274 --> 31:16.540
I'd say you were
losing on purpose.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.308
- No, it's not that, it's just

31:18.344 --> 31:20.043
I have a lot on
my mind with work.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.645
We have a lot of shows
coming up, that's good.

31:21.680 --> 31:24.147
We have two concerts in June,
two more on the horizon.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.917
- You know, that horizon's
gonna expand indefinitely

31:26.952 --> 31:27.951
once you get married.

31:27.987 --> 31:32.055
College funds, mortgages,
retirement planning.

31:32.091 --> 31:32.923
- He didn't make the PGA Tour,

31:32.958 --> 31:36.059
but Clay makes a
good living, Major.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.261
- Thank you.

31:37.296 --> 31:40.764
- All right, partner,
we need a good one here.

31:40.799 --> 31:42.866
- So, Ted, what line
of work are you in?

31:42.902 --> 31:45.435
- I'm an electrician,
I own my own business.

31:45.471 --> 31:48.238
- Excellent, an electrician.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.040
Reliable.
- Thank you.

31:50.809 --> 31:53.277
- Something everybody needs.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.379
- Kind of like music,
especially in Memphis.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.813
- Mm-hmm.

31:56.849 --> 31:59.316
- Of course it's always
good to have a backup plan

31:59.351 --> 32:01.251
in case something goes wrong.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.053
- In my experience, if
you have a backup plan,

32:03.088 --> 32:06.023
you end up doing
the backup plan.

32:06.058 --> 32:06.924
- Fore!

32:12.331 --> 32:13.430
- Sorry.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.132
- Great.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.302
- Here, have a backup.

32:22.675 --> 32:25.642
- [Isabelle] This really was
a wonderful idea, thank you.

32:25.678 --> 32:27.811
- Oh, I'm so glad
you enjoyed it.

32:27.846 --> 32:30.213
It sure is nice to get
pampered every now and then.

32:30.249 --> 32:33.350
- Although, I must say it
took me a little bit to relax

32:33.385 --> 32:36.153
listening to all of those
over the top wedding ideas.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.755
- I know, but some of them
aren't so bad, don't you think?

32:38.791 --> 32:42.960
- Well, you know what
they say, "Less is more."

32:42.995 --> 32:45.729
- (hoots) These were right
outside the steam room.

32:45.764 --> 32:48.799
Imagine if we had lost these.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.000
- Imagine.

32:50.035 --> 32:51.935
- Call me, we'll talk.

32:55.174 --> 32:58.508
(gentle guitar music)

32:59.812 --> 33:02.846
(cheerful humming)

33:13.659 --> 33:16.560
- Is this a bank or
the Grand Ole Opry?

33:16.595 --> 33:18.929
- Sometimes I just
can't help myself.

33:18.964 --> 33:21.131
- Thought I could walk you home.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.733
Can I carry your books?

33:22.768 --> 33:23.767
- I accept.

33:26.972 --> 33:29.339
- So, how was the big
morning with the ladies?

33:29.375 --> 33:31.341
- Torn between two mothers.

33:31.377 --> 33:32.576
One wants everything bigger,

33:32.611 --> 33:34.945
the other wants
everything smaller.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.848
You know how spas are
serene and relaxing?

33:37.883 --> 33:38.548
- Yeah.

33:38.584 --> 33:41.151
- Think the opposite of that.

33:41.186 --> 33:44.154
How was golf with the boys?

33:44.189 --> 33:47.024
- Did everything I
could, I even lost.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.525
- You lost at golf?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.861
- Look, it was worth
a shot, but your dad

33:50.896 --> 33:53.030
still seems to think I
produce puppet shows.

33:53.065 --> 33:55.265
- Maybe you're trying too
hard, is that possible?

33:55.300 --> 33:57.434
- Well, he's gonna
be my father-in-law,

33:57.469 --> 34:00.337
so I care about what he thinks.

34:01.740 --> 34:02.939
- He'll come around.

34:02.975 --> 34:04.274
On the bright side,
your mom and I

34:04.309 --> 34:07.477
actually got along
pretty well today.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.279
She had some fun ideas.

34:09.314 --> 34:11.948
- Really? For instance?

34:11.984 --> 34:15.118
- Maybe not fun, fun
but doves at a reception

34:15.154 --> 34:18.388
and something about
a confetti cannon?

34:18.424 --> 34:19.823
- I hope you heard wrong.

34:19.858 --> 34:21.825
- Oh, I forgot to tell
you, Sally said she found

34:21.860 --> 34:23.994
the perfect band to
play at our reception.

34:24.029 --> 34:26.296
She wants us all to go hear
them tonight at Lafayette's.

34:26.331 --> 34:27.597
- So she's doing my job now?

34:27.633 --> 34:29.766
- Let's stop by my
place on the way.

34:29.802 --> 34:32.936
I don't wanna wear
my work clothes.

34:35.908 --> 34:39.242
♪ On my way back to Memphis

34:39.278 --> 34:42.979

34:52.324 --> 34:54.191

- You made it.

34:56.161 --> 34:57.294
- [Laurel] So, is this the band?

34:57.329 --> 34:58.361
- This is just the warmup.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.997
The other act is on later
and you'll love them.

35:01.033 --> 35:02.299
- What's the name, I
probably know them.

35:02.334 --> 35:05.102
- It's a surprise, relax.

35:05.137 --> 35:06.069
- All right, did our
parents show up yet?

35:06.105 --> 35:09.639
- They did and trying
to have a good time.

35:09.675 --> 35:12.142
Well, two of them at least.

35:13.312 --> 35:15.879
- Let's go say hey
to dad and Isabelle.

35:15.914 --> 35:19.649
- We'll see you soon.
- All right, got it.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.252
- They're here.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.353
- Hey y'all.

35:23.388 --> 35:25.989
Hey Isabelle, hey daddy.
- Hey, sweetheart.

35:26.024 --> 35:29.793
- Isn't this so fun, a
night out altogether?

35:29.828 --> 35:30.827
- What do you think
of this place?

35:30.863 --> 35:32.462
- It's very loud.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.731
- You know, Memphis is
home of the Blues, Jazz--

35:34.766 --> 35:36.666
- How long does this
go on, you know?

35:36.702 --> 35:37.534
- This song?

35:37.569 --> 35:38.668
- The evening.

35:38.704 --> 35:41.071
(cheering)

35:42.341 --> 35:47.110
- Lafayette's you've been
wonderful, thank y'all so much.

35:47.146 --> 35:50.080
- All right now, we got
some special performers

35:50.115 --> 35:51.381
coming to the stage.

35:51.416 --> 35:54.718
So please, give a
warm round of applause

35:54.753 --> 35:57.487
to Laurel Couper
and Clay Sheppard.

35:57.523 --> 35:58.255
- Us?

35:58.290 --> 36:00.590
(cheering)

36:00.626 --> 36:01.858
- You know anything about this?

36:01.894 --> 36:03.727
- No, daddy, I swear.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.163
- Oh Laurel, y'all
get on up there.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.931
- What I tell you, the
best act in Memphis,

36:07.966 --> 36:10.367
and perfect to perform
at your wedding.

36:10.402 --> 36:11.801
- Are you sure you
want to do this?

36:11.837 --> 36:14.337
- Not much of a choice now.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.339
Sal, you know I hate
being put on the spot.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.108
- Get used to it, you're
gonna be front and center

36:18.143 --> 36:19.409
for them soon anyway.

36:19.444 --> 36:22.712

36:24.816 --> 36:26.049
- Let's hear some music!

36:26.084 --> 36:28.518

36:28.554 --> 36:30.554
- Well fine, y'all
put us on the spot

36:30.589 --> 36:31.655
and we're up here now.

36:31.690 --> 36:32.789
What do y'all wanna hear?

36:32.824 --> 36:34.891
- How about some Elvis?

36:36.962 --> 36:38.328
- All right.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.463
What do you say we release
the hound dogs, boys?

36:40.499 --> 36:41.798

38:46.491 --> 38:49.726
(somber piano music)

38:54.399 --> 38:58.168
- Which one of you has
a wedding coming up?

38:58.203 --> 38:59.703
- That would be me.

38:59.738 --> 39:01.204
- Do you mind if
we browse a bit?

39:01.239 --> 39:03.540
- Make yourselves at home, I'm
around if you need anything.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.408
- Okay.
- Thank you.

39:06.345 --> 39:08.411
- You two were
terrific last night.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.347
You should take that
act on the road again.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.115
- Right, maybe we'll
squeeze that between

39:12.150 --> 39:13.483
the catering and the flowers.

39:13.518 --> 39:17.620
- Okay, okay point
taken, but you and Clay

39:17.656 --> 39:19.589
do make beautiful
music together.

39:19.624 --> 39:21.191
- Tell that to my father.

39:21.226 --> 39:23.860
What was his excuse for
skipping out last night?

39:23.895 --> 39:26.696
- Well, he told me that he had
to be up early for something.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.832
- His morning run.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.233
The fact is that he's
just not interested

39:30.268 --> 39:31.201
in that side of me.

39:31.236 --> 39:32.902
I mean, you remember,
he only came to what

39:32.938 --> 39:34.404
like two of our shows.

39:34.439 --> 39:38.441
- His loss if you ask me.
- I know, right.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.275
Okay, we've only got an hour

39:39.311 --> 39:42.379
before Trish and
Isabelle get here.

39:42.414 --> 39:44.347
I swear those two.

39:44.383 --> 39:47.350
- Well, this is the perfect
place to take your mind

39:47.386 --> 39:49.486
off of all of that

39:49.521 --> 39:52.522
Welcome to wedding wonderland.

39:52.557 --> 39:55.425
- Oh my gosh, we hit
the jackpot here, Sal.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.227
Oh, what do you think?

39:57.262 --> 39:58.495
- Beautiful.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.463
What did your mom wear
on her wedding day?

40:00.499 --> 40:04.567
- It was all white lace, but
she had her wild side too.

40:04.603 --> 40:07.670
She had her shoes
covered in rhinestones.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.807
- Rhinestones,
now we're talking.

40:12.677 --> 40:14.711
- You're early.
- So are you.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.746
Hold on to your
hat, there's news.

40:16.782 --> 40:18.615
- Yes, there is news.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.216
- Allie has booked
a horse and carriage

40:20.252 --> 40:21.785
to take y'all to the chapel.

40:21.820 --> 40:22.485
- Oh.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.553
- She asked me what I thought.

40:23.588 --> 40:24.954
I just couldn't resist.

40:24.990 --> 40:28.224
- It's true, she couldn't,
she really couldn't.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.393
So, you see anything you like?

40:30.429 --> 40:32.729
- Well, I was thinking that--

40:32.764 --> 40:34.397
- Thank goodness
we're here to help.

40:34.433 --> 40:35.665
All right, now,
let's get to work.

40:35.700 --> 40:36.866
Come on, let's get to work.

40:36.902 --> 40:39.969
(swanky jazz music)

41:08.166 --> 41:10.099
- Which one did you like?

41:10.135 --> 41:11.401
- If it's the one
with the train,

41:11.436 --> 41:12.602
we're gonna have to
plan your entrance.

41:12.671 --> 41:16.272
- Well, y'all are just gonna
have to wait for the big day.

41:16.308 --> 41:17.540
Let's just say it's
the perfect dress,

41:17.576 --> 41:19.609
and I couldn't have
done it without y'all.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.611
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

41:21.646 --> 41:24.080
- [Sal] Good answer.

41:24.115 --> 41:26.716
- I know which one.
- Me too.

41:27.552 --> 41:29.686
- Mr. Sheppard, welcome back.
- Thank you.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.721
- I have your rings right here.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.623
Here comes the bride.

41:34.292 --> 41:35.492
- [Clay] Wow, that's perfect.

41:35.527 --> 41:37.961
- And yours, very handsome.

41:41.032 --> 41:41.831
- Huh.

41:43.535 --> 41:45.468
- A wedding band does
reflect its owner,

41:45.504 --> 41:48.404
and I do recall
you're a musician.

41:48.440 --> 41:52.342
- Could we maybe go with
something a tad more?

41:53.345 --> 41:54.477
- Not a problem.

41:54.513 --> 41:57.146
Let me show you some
simple gold bands.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.549
- Thanks.
- Be right back.

41:59.584 --> 42:00.617
- Are you letting
the major get to you?

42:00.652 --> 42:05.221
- No, it's just if I'm
going to be settling down,

42:05.257 --> 42:08.358
perhaps I should settle down.

42:08.393 --> 42:10.660
- Yeah, that sounds
like the Major talking.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.795
- Our venue in New Orleans,
it just lost its permit

42:12.831 --> 42:16.232
so maybe I do need to
start looking for something

42:16.268 --> 42:17.467
a little more stable.

42:17.502 --> 42:18.835
- Really?

42:18.870 --> 42:20.703
What would that be?

42:22.474 --> 42:23.873
- Look, I know you're
right, but these plans,

42:23.909 --> 42:26.075
everything's been
moving so fast.

42:26.111 --> 42:29.445
Was your wedding
this out of control?

42:29.481 --> 42:32.882
- Son, every wedding is
its own kind of crazy.

42:32.918 --> 42:35.852
Dealing with two families,
twice the stress.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.654
But go easy on yourself.

42:37.689 --> 42:39.789
The shower this weekend
will be a blast.

42:39.824 --> 42:43.259
Your mom's got this
great idea for it.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.364
- You know what you need,

42:48.400 --> 42:49.499
a romantic night out.

42:49.601 --> 42:52.835
Just you and Laurel away from
all this wedding madness.

42:52.871 --> 42:57.006
- That's the best idea
I've heard so far.

42:57.042 --> 42:59.542
I'm gonna go with this one.

43:01.713 --> 43:04.080
- No way, a pink Cadillac?

43:05.083 --> 43:07.083
Did you trade your
car in for that?

43:07.118 --> 43:08.851
- For my fiancee,
it's only the best.

43:08.887 --> 43:10.820
- If I didn't know any
better, I would think

43:10.855 --> 43:12.755
you were Prince Charming.

43:12.791 --> 43:13.923
- Who said I wasn't?

43:13.959 --> 43:16.893
Your carriage
awaits, Cinderella.

43:17.862 --> 43:19.729
- So, where are we headed?

43:19.764 --> 43:22.665
- A little trip down memory
lane, and all the wedding talk--

43:22.701 --> 43:24.634
- Is off-limits.
- Exactly.

43:24.669 --> 43:29.372
- All right, your Highness,
let's get this carriage going.

43:29.407 --> 43:31.708
(cheering)

43:31.743 --> 43:35.912
(optimistic orchestral music)

43:44.789 --> 43:46.289
You really are Prince Charming.

43:46.324 --> 43:48.825
- Well this is a
full-service date.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.793
- We really have this
all to ourselves?

43:50.829 --> 43:52.128
- Yes we do.

43:52.163 --> 43:53.830
- Clay, how in world did you?

43:53.865 --> 43:57.133
- I know a guy who
knows a guy, you know.

43:57.168 --> 43:58.735
- You're amazing.

43:58.770 --> 44:01.237
You remember the last
time we were up here?

44:01.272 --> 44:03.172
- I do, senior prom.

44:03.208 --> 44:04.340
- That's right.

44:04.376 --> 44:05.642
- You know, I'm not
sure if I remember

44:05.677 --> 44:06.809
the first song we
slow danced to.

44:06.845 --> 44:10.079
But I do remember Major
having his 10 o'clock curfew.

44:10.115 --> 44:12.448
- Well that's old
news, curfew's 11 now.

44:12.484 --> 44:14.717
- 11, so we don't get
to stay out late enough

44:14.753 --> 44:16.919
to see the pink Cadillac
turn into a pumpkin?

44:16.955 --> 44:17.820
- Nope.

44:20.925 --> 44:22.091
You know it was my
dad who pushed me

44:22.127 --> 44:23.960
to go to business school.

44:23.995 --> 44:26.129
- Backup plan?
- Exactly.

44:26.865 --> 44:29.165
When I got the job
at Chicago Financial,

44:29.200 --> 44:30.700
he was over the moon.

44:30.735 --> 44:32.902
It's like I'm a flower
and he only gives sunlight

44:32.937 --> 44:35.938
in the direction he
wants me to grow.

44:35.974 --> 44:37.306
- I'm sure he means well.

44:37.342 --> 44:39.642
- This coming from the
same guy who's sure

44:39.678 --> 44:41.744
that my dad doesn't like him.

44:41.780 --> 44:43.880
- Look, enough
about the parents.

44:43.915 --> 44:46.349
Tonight is gonna be about us.

44:47.085 --> 44:50.019
(phone dinging)

44:52.023 --> 44:52.922
That was my sister.

44:52.957 --> 44:56.793
She has these questions
about gift registry.

44:56.828 --> 44:59.395
- Allie booked a
celebrity chef who needs

44:59.431 --> 45:01.397
to finalize the
dinner, but our mothers

45:01.433 --> 45:03.066
can't agree on the menu.

45:03.101 --> 45:04.434
(phone dings)

45:04.469 --> 45:08.371
Oh, and Isabelle is complaining
about the dove wranglers.

45:08.406 --> 45:10.006
- Dove wranglers?

45:10.041 --> 45:13.876
- Well, you can't hire the
doves without their people.

45:13.912 --> 45:15.311
(phone dinging)

45:15.346 --> 45:17.413
- Okay, we're gonna
turn these off,

45:17.449 --> 45:18.581
and save it for tomorrow.

45:18.616 --> 45:20.016
- But--
- No, no, no.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.351
No more interruptions.

45:22.387 --> 45:24.287
- Well except for one.

45:27.025 --> 45:30.126
(gentle rock music)

45:36.901 --> 45:38.835
May I have this dance?

45:38.870 --> 45:41.204
- Clay Sheppard,
you did remember.

45:41.239 --> 45:42.405
- How could I forget?

45:42.440 --> 45:45.875
- It's only the best
dance of my life.

45:50.415 --> 45:53.082
- This is just what
we needed, just us.

47:28.413 --> 47:32.215
- All right, girls,
everybody pick a ribbon.

47:33.051 --> 47:34.984
One, two, three, pull.

47:38.056 --> 47:39.088
- It's an arrow.

47:39.123 --> 47:41.924
- Look at that, that means
you're full of wisdom.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.292
- And I've got a
four-leaf clover.

47:43.328 --> 47:45.061
- That means that
you've got a bunch

What'd you get, honey?

47:50.735 --> 47:51.868
- [Clay] Does the bride
get her lucky charm?

47:51.936 --> 47:54.637
- Just the girls, the bride
already has her lucky charm.

47:54.672 --> 47:56.005
- Yes, you do.

47:56.941 --> 47:58.040
- I do.

48:00.044 --> 48:00.710
- You are gonna be saying that

48:00.745 --> 48:03.279
pretty soon for real, you know?

48:03.314 --> 48:05.648
- How do you think
it's all going?

48:05.683 --> 48:06.883
- Better now.

48:07.752 --> 48:08.618
I think your dad
thought that the boat

48:08.686 --> 48:11.520
was gonna go down
with all these people.

48:11.556 --> 48:14.090
- Well, your folks do
have a lot of friends.

48:14.125 --> 48:15.424
- [Clay] I know.

48:15.460 --> 48:19.061
- Wow, that view, never
gets old, does it?

48:20.365 --> 48:24.400
And, you mind if I steal
her away for a dance?

48:24.435 --> 48:25.568
- Be my guest.

48:25.603 --> 48:28.804
- I've danced with
everybody else.

48:28.840 --> 48:31.440
Don't step on my toes,
I won't step on yours.

48:31.476 --> 48:34.043
- I can't promise that.
- Okay.

48:44.589 --> 48:45.888
- Major.
- Hey.

48:47.125 --> 48:48.124
- Where's Isabelle?

48:48.159 --> 48:50.393
- Below, lying down.

48:50.428 --> 48:51.994
Not too good on the water.

48:52.030 --> 48:53.095
- Ah.

48:53.831 --> 48:56.699
- Wow, you know, when
your parents said

48:56.734 --> 48:59.969
they were bringing family,
I didn't realize it meant

49:00.004 --> 49:02.471
all of East Tennessee.

49:02.507 --> 49:04.140
- I know my folks
have their own style,

49:04.175 --> 49:05.841
but it comes from a
good place, I promise.

49:05.877 --> 49:09.278
They take things a
bit too far sometimes.

49:09.314 --> 49:10.413
- You think?

49:13.718 --> 49:15.184
- You know, maybe
I can fix this.

49:15.219 --> 49:16.986
- Now, you can't
un-invite guests, son,

49:17.021 --> 49:18.554
I wouldn't ask them to.

49:18.589 --> 49:21.657
- It's not what I
meant, excuse me.

49:24.262 --> 49:26.162
- Okay, okay, perfect.

49:29.567 --> 49:30.800
Bye-bye, now.

49:31.836 --> 49:33.402
Guess who just spoke
to three harpist

49:33.438 --> 49:35.071
to play the wedding march?

49:35.106 --> 49:35.972
- Wow.

49:36.040 --> 49:38.708
I was thinking maybe
just a good guitar.

49:38.743 --> 49:39.709
- Oh, Clay.

49:41.012 --> 49:42.678
- Can we talk for one second?

49:42.714 --> 49:43.813
- Sure.

49:43.848 --> 49:46.916
- Laurel and I were
discussing maybe,

49:46.951 --> 49:50.920
maybe what we need is
just a little bit less.

49:50.955 --> 49:52.321
- I don't follow.

49:54.726 --> 49:56.559
- We appreciate everything
that you've been doing

49:56.594 --> 49:57.994
for this wedding,
it's been great.

49:58.029 --> 50:01.630
But it's becoming just
a little too much.

50:01.666 --> 50:02.965
- Too much?

50:03.001 --> 50:05.735
Those words aren't in my
vocabulary, what do you mean?

50:05.770 --> 50:07.970
- The harps, and the doves,
and confetti cannons,

50:08.006 --> 50:10.139
and horse-drawn carriages.

50:11.409 --> 50:15.111
Maybe if we could just scale
things back just a little.

50:15.146 --> 50:17.880
- Change my plans,
all of my plans

50:17.915 --> 50:19.482
with five days left, huh?

50:19.517 --> 50:21.784
When I have been
working night and day

50:21.819 --> 50:24.920
to make all of this
happen for you.

50:27.492 --> 50:28.891
I don't do simple.

50:28.926 --> 50:33.696
If you wanted simple, why did
you get a wedding planner?

50:34.966 --> 50:37.099
- Well if you remember, it
wasn't our idea to start with.

50:37.135 --> 50:39.835
- How's it going, you two?

50:39.871 --> 50:42.138
- I'll tell you how it's going.

50:42.173 --> 50:43.005
I quit.

50:44.208 --> 50:45.207
- Allie, Clay?

50:47.745 --> 50:48.844
What happened?

50:48.880 --> 50:51.313
- I may have said
something to upset her.

50:51.349 --> 50:52.815
- She just quit.

50:52.850 --> 50:55.584
- Yeah, I know, that's not good.

51:00.224 --> 51:01.357
Thank you.

51:05.830 --> 51:08.798
Allie just took all the
vendors and contacts with her.

51:08.833 --> 51:10.499
- (sighing) Great.

51:10.535 --> 51:15.704
So we're back to square one
with five days for the wedding.

51:16.641 --> 51:19.341
We're gonna need
a florist, a DJ.

51:19.377 --> 51:22.044
Caterer, tables,
chairs, decorations.

51:22.080 --> 51:25.081
We don't even have a minister
to perform the ceremony.

51:25.116 --> 51:26.148
- No need to panic yet.

51:26.184 --> 51:29.485
I'm gonna figure this
out, I'm a problem-solver.

51:29.520 --> 51:32.788
- I don't know, I think
maybe Isabelle was right,

51:32.824 --> 51:34.223
"Less is more."

51:39.163 --> 51:42.198
- Laurel, you're gonna
get the wedding you want

51:42.233 --> 51:43.766
one way or another.

51:45.002 --> 51:46.802
- [Laurel] So you're actually
gonna make this happen?

51:46.838 --> 51:50.239
- No, we are gonna make
this happen as a team.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.641
- Well then, we
better stop talking

51:52.677 --> 51:55.077
and start getting things done.

51:55.113 --> 51:58.714
♪ A little bit conversation
a little more action please ♪

51:58.749 --> 52:03.018
♪ All this time for bringing
satisfaction in me ♪

52:03.054 --> 52:05.121
♪ A little more light
a little more fluff ♪

52:05.156 --> 52:07.056
♪ A little less kind
a little more spunk ♪

52:07.091 --> 52:08.491
♪ Just to let you know
we left you behind baby ♪

52:08.526 --> 52:09.959
♪ Baby make it funny

52:09.994 --> 52:11.060
♪ Spunky spunky

52:11.095 --> 52:12.461
♪ Make it funny (funky funky)

52:12.497 --> 52:15.498
(upbeat pop music)

52:31.816 --> 52:34.183
(ritzy piano music)

52:34.218 --> 52:35.885
- It's kind of has that.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.720
- [Isabelle] Where are
you gonna put that?

52:37.755 --> 52:38.854
- Into the pews.
- Oh.

52:38.890 --> 52:41.757
- [Trish] I think we can
put these on the ends of it.

52:41.792 --> 52:43.826
- Hey, is everything
under control?

52:43.861 --> 52:45.227
- Tiny bit crazy.
- Yeah?

52:45.263 --> 52:47.229
- But we were making
some progress.

52:47.265 --> 52:49.398
Sally said that her friend,
at the design studio

52:49.433 --> 52:52.268
can do the photography
work at the wedding,

52:52.303 --> 52:53.836
so that's covered.
- Good.

52:53.871 --> 52:55.004
- Anything on your end?

52:55.039 --> 52:56.572
- Yeah, remember Jim, my roadie?

52:56.607 --> 52:57.773
He wanted to be the chef?

52:57.808 --> 52:59.875
He's now running
Delta's Kitchen so he's

52:59.911 --> 53:01.143
got the catering covered.

53:01.179 --> 53:02.511
- Oh, good.

53:02.547 --> 53:05.147
- But, we're still
missing a minister.

53:05.183 --> 53:07.116
- Maybe we can call
Reverend Olson.

53:07.151 --> 53:09.351
He was my mom's
pastor growing up,

53:09.387 --> 53:11.887
and they really close.
- Okay.

53:11.923 --> 53:13.155
- He lives in Little Rock now,

53:13.191 --> 53:14.790
so I'll give him a call
and see if he can do it.

53:14.825 --> 53:16.258
- Good idea.
- I think so too.

53:16.294 --> 53:19.361
- Hey mom, do the
horseshoes go up or down?

53:19.397 --> 53:21.297
- Definitely up,
you don't want all

53:21.332 --> 53:24.500
that good light to pour out.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.535
We need all we can get.

53:28.973 --> 53:32.141
- Hey, how can I be
more useful to you?

53:32.176 --> 53:35.411
- I promised Emma ice
cream over an hour ago.

53:35.446 --> 53:37.112
Could you?
- Ice cream?

53:37.148 --> 53:39.381
Yeah, that'll be the easiest
thing I've done all day.

53:39.417 --> 53:42.284
Emma, what do you say,
you and me ice cream date?

53:42.320 --> 53:43.786
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

53:43.821 --> 53:47.022
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
- Thank you.

53:49.193 --> 53:53.229
- Laurel, honey, I think
horseshoes with ribbons

53:53.264 --> 53:56.599
at the end of each pew would
just be lovely, don't you?

53:56.634 --> 53:59.501
- I think roses in
clear, crystal vases

53:59.537 --> 54:01.303
would be a better choice.

54:01.339 --> 54:02.805
- [Trish and Isabelle]
What do you think?

54:02.840 --> 54:06.141
- Well, I do love the
fun of the horseshoes.

54:06.177 --> 54:09.645
And the simple
vases are nice too.

54:09.680 --> 54:13.349
- I think what Laurel is saying
is she wants traditional.

54:13.384 --> 54:14.817
- And I think
what's she's saying

54:14.852 --> 54:17.586
is that she thinks
horseshoes are more fun.

54:17.622 --> 54:18.654
(phone buzzing)

54:18.689 --> 54:20.322
- Oh, I think what
Laurel is saying is that

54:20.358 --> 54:22.925
she needs to take this call.

54:24.362 --> 54:26.161
- This is better.
- This is better.

54:26.197 --> 54:28.464
- This is.
- This is better.

54:29.433 --> 54:31.166
- This is so good.

54:32.336 --> 54:34.270
- It's because you have
all the key ingredients

54:34.305 --> 54:36.272
to a perfect sundae.

54:36.307 --> 54:39.341
You have the chocolate
sauce, the whipped cream,

54:39.377 --> 54:41.110
and the cherry.

54:41.145 --> 54:44.647
- And a really big spoon.
- Exactly.

54:44.682 --> 54:46.415
- Can this be a tradition?

54:46.450 --> 54:47.716
Mom said that when
we're a family,

54:47.752 --> 54:50.653
we gotta pick our own
family traditions.

54:50.688 --> 54:51.987
I pick this one.

54:52.023 --> 54:53.255
- What else?

54:53.291 --> 54:57.159
Let's see, we could
do Monday movie night.

54:58.829 --> 55:02.598
Taco Tuesday, no,
Trampoline Tuesdays.

55:02.633 --> 55:05.534
- All of those, I can't wait.

55:05.569 --> 55:08.504
You know what, me either.

55:08.539 --> 55:09.638
Cheers.

55:10.641 --> 55:11.674
Something on your nose.

55:11.709 --> 55:15.511
(groans)
(Clay laughing)

55:17.315 --> 55:19.481
- Thank you so much.

55:19.517 --> 55:22.518
Good news, Reverend Olson's
flying in for the wedding.

55:22.553 --> 55:23.352
- Really?

55:23.387 --> 55:24.520
- Yep.
- All right.

55:24.555 --> 55:26.055
Almost the last
piece of the puzzle.

55:26.090 --> 55:30.326
- I guess, (sighs) I just wish
everyone were getting along.

55:30.361 --> 55:31.460
- Yeah, thanks Eileen.

55:31.495 --> 55:32.961
- [Eileen] Thank you.

55:32.997 --> 55:36.465
- I had this image of a big
house, one big happy family,

55:36.500 --> 55:37.900
all together for the holidays.

55:37.935 --> 55:39.034
And now it just
seems like a life

55:39.070 --> 55:41.370
of airports and separate visits.

55:41.405 --> 55:42.471
- Yeah.

55:42.506 --> 55:46.642
- I wish your parents would
reach out to my folks.

55:46.677 --> 55:49.878
- Yeah, your parents should
try a little harder, too.

55:49.914 --> 55:51.080
It takes two to tango.

55:51.115 --> 55:53.282
Well in this case, four.

55:53.317 --> 55:55.084
- I know this is
gonna sound crazy,

55:55.119 --> 55:58.554
but I kind of wish
Allie were still here.

55:58.589 --> 55:59.822
- What?
- What in the world

55:59.857 --> 56:01.156
did you say to scare
her off like that?

56:01.192 --> 56:02.291
- Me?

56:02.360 --> 56:03.992
I didn't say anything, she
was a bull in a china shop.

56:04.028 --> 56:07.830
You should be thanking me,
she was driving you nuts.

56:07.865 --> 56:10.666
- Wow.
- You know what I mean.

56:11.635 --> 56:13.068
I just want you to be happy.

56:13.104 --> 56:15.604
- Oh, I'll be happy as soon
as I walk down the aisle

56:15.639 --> 56:17.706
and everyone goes home.

56:18.943 --> 56:22.945
- So I see you've met Tucker,
he's one of our rescue horses.

56:22.980 --> 56:24.613
- He's beautiful.

56:26.884 --> 56:28.317
- Ms. Presley?

56:28.352 --> 56:30.119
- You can call me Priscilla.

56:30.154 --> 56:32.688
So, are you enjoying your
visit here at Graceland?

56:32.723 --> 56:34.223
- Absolutely, it's beautiful.

56:34.258 --> 56:36.392
We're actually getting
married in the chapel.

56:36.427 --> 56:38.394
- Yeah, (stammering)
two days, two days?

56:38.429 --> 56:39.762
- Well, that's the plan, anyway.

56:39.797 --> 56:41.897
- That's so exciting,
congratulations.

56:41.932 --> 56:43.465
- Yeah, Clay.

56:43.501 --> 56:44.233
This is my fiancee, Laurel.

56:44.268 --> 56:45.901
- Laurel.
- Nice meeting you both.

56:45.936 --> 56:46.802
Two days?

56:47.805 --> 56:48.637
- Wow.

56:49.640 --> 56:51.673
- We were excited
when we got engaged,

56:51.709 --> 56:53.642
but it's just been.

56:53.677 --> 56:57.713
- Yeah, it's been hectic
with all the planning

56:57.748 --> 56:59.481
and the details, and.

56:59.517 --> 57:01.183
- I can totally relate.

57:01.218 --> 57:02.351
- Yeah.

57:02.386 --> 57:03.318
- You know, if you
have some time,

57:03.354 --> 57:05.354
I have something that I
would love to show you

57:05.389 --> 57:07.022
that's very special to me.

57:07.057 --> 57:08.123
Are you game?
- Yes.

57:08.159 --> 57:09.625
- Okay.
- Absolutely.

57:09.660 --> 57:11.660
Oh my goodness.
- Let's do it.

57:11.695 --> 57:15.164
(peaceful piano music)

57:16.901 --> 57:19.268
Weddings can be a
whirlwind, that's for sure.

57:19.303 --> 57:21.904
When Elvis and I got
married in Vegas,

57:21.939 --> 57:24.540
we had to sneak out of
this house in Palm Springs

57:24.575 --> 57:27.743
with all our friends to get
away from the paparazzi.

57:27.778 --> 57:29.411
- Oh my gosh, I
can't even imagine.

57:29.447 --> 57:32.181
- Yeah, it was crazy times.

57:32.216 --> 57:35.818
But we had a wedding that
was private, and intimate,

57:35.853 --> 57:38.787
and you know, that's
exactly how we wanted it.

57:38.823 --> 57:40.322
- Right, you know.

57:40.357 --> 57:41.390
- So.

57:41.492 --> 57:44.460
- Sounds like what we
should've had from the start.

57:44.495 --> 57:47.796
- Oh my, your dress
was so beautiful.

57:49.467 --> 57:50.666
- [Priscilla] Thank you.

57:50.701 --> 57:52.434
- [Clay] That was
some tux Elvis had.

57:52.470 --> 57:53.902
- Mm-hmm.

57:53.938 --> 57:55.771
It feels like just yesterday.

57:55.806 --> 57:57.473
- Do you mind me
asking what the two

57:57.508 --> 57:59.141
of you picked as your song.

57:59.176 --> 58:01.643
- "Love Me Tender" of course.

58:02.680 --> 58:04.947
- Naturally, it's
the perfect song.

58:04.982 --> 58:06.081
- Yeah.

58:06.116 --> 58:07.483
- We're hoping to make
it to that first dance.

58:07.518 --> 58:09.051
We still have so much
to pull together,

58:09.086 --> 58:12.521
and our families disagree
about everything.

58:12.556 --> 58:13.989
- Pretty much.

58:14.024 --> 58:16.592
- Well, whatever happens,
the most important thing

58:16.627 --> 58:21.330
is to remember the most
important thing, each other.

58:22.666 --> 58:25.300
Listen, the two of you
seem like a great couple.

58:25.336 --> 58:29.004
I wish you all the happiness
in the world, I truly do.

58:29.039 --> 58:32.574
- Thank you so much,
Priscilla Presley.

58:33.677 --> 58:34.343
- Nice meeting you both.

58:34.378 --> 58:35.744
- Nice meeting you, thank you.

58:35.779 --> 58:37.212
- Good luck, I'm go
gonna take a ride now.

58:37.248 --> 58:38.981
Take care.
- Bye-bye.

58:40.484 --> 58:41.950
Oh my gosh, how embarrassing.

58:41.986 --> 58:43.385
- You called her
Priscilla Presley.

58:43.420 --> 58:44.319
- I know.

58:46.557 --> 58:47.356
Really?

58:49.393 --> 58:52.694
- And that starts
by not compromising.

58:53.664 --> 58:56.265
- Well with our parents,
that's easier said than done.

58:56.300 --> 58:57.499
- Well, we have to try.

58:57.535 --> 59:01.737
And that starts first
thing in the morning.

59:01.772 --> 59:04.540
(majestic music)

59:08.679 --> 59:09.545
- Clay?

59:11.749 --> 59:12.948
You're up early.

59:12.983 --> 59:15.117
- Isabelle said I
might find you here.

59:15.152 --> 59:16.251
- What's up?

59:17.321 --> 59:19.121
- I think we should have a talk.

59:19.156 --> 59:20.122
Man to man.

59:21.692 --> 59:23.759
- Probably overdue.

59:23.794 --> 59:25.494
Walk with me.

59:25.529 --> 59:26.528
- Sir, I can't help
but get the feeling

59:26.564 --> 59:28.797
you have some reservations
with Laurel and me.

59:28.832 --> 59:32.234
- Oh, I don't have any
reservations about Laurel.

59:32.269 --> 59:33.468
- So it's me?

59:34.705 --> 59:37.906
- Clay, I'm sure you're
a fine young man.

59:37.942 --> 59:40.742
It's the music
business I don't trust.

59:40.778 --> 59:42.511
I thought Laurel
had escaped all that

59:42.546 --> 59:44.313
when she got into finance.

59:44.348 --> 59:46.181
- And then I came
back into the picture.

59:46.216 --> 59:48.984
- Brought the music with you.

59:49.019 --> 59:52.854
- Sir, music's a huge part of
my life and Laurel's as well.

59:52.890 --> 59:54.790
There's no getting around that.

59:54.825 --> 59:58.794
- Look, you're going to be
raising my granddaughter,

59:58.829 --> 1:00:00.762
I need to know that
Laurel and Emma

1:00:00.798 --> 1:00:02.731
have somebody that
they can depend on.

1:00:02.766 --> 1:00:05.567
Someone reliable, solid.

1:00:05.603 --> 1:00:06.835
- Yes, sir.

1:00:06.870 --> 1:00:09.371
I get it and you're right.

1:00:09.406 --> 1:00:13.642
My business can be very
unpredictable like life.

1:00:14.645 --> 1:00:16.878
And I'm not sure how I
can put your mind at ease,

1:00:16.914 --> 1:00:19.181
but I'm really
good at what I do.

1:00:19.216 --> 1:00:22.517
And one thing that's never,
never going to change

1:00:22.553 --> 1:00:26.455
is my love for your
daughter, and Emma too.

1:00:26.490 --> 1:00:29.558
And no matter what life
has in store for us,

1:00:29.593 --> 1:00:32.761
we're gonna get
through it together.

1:00:34.264 --> 1:00:38.166
- Laurel said you were
as stubborn as I am.

1:00:38.202 --> 1:00:40.836
Appreciate the straight talk.

1:00:41.872 --> 1:00:44.773
- Wait, sir, is this a
agree to disagree moment?

1:00:44.808 --> 1:00:46.942
- Maybe so, gotta run.

1:00:52.316 --> 1:00:55.350
(soft jazzy music)

1:00:56.720 --> 1:00:58.286
- This can't be right.

1:00:58.322 --> 1:00:59.888
There's only supposed
to be one cake.

1:00:59.923 --> 1:01:01.156
- That's right.

1:01:01.191 --> 1:01:02.624
- Wait, so you're
making two cakes

1:01:02.660 --> 1:01:04.493
for the Couper-Sheppard wedding?

1:01:04.528 --> 1:01:07.562
- One Couper, one Sheppard.

1:01:07.598 --> 1:01:09.197
- Unbelievable.

1:01:09.233 --> 1:01:12.200
- Well, if you only need
one, which one do you want?

1:01:12.236 --> 1:01:13.802
- I'm gonna have to get
back to you on that.

1:01:13.837 --> 1:01:16.071
First, I have two
mothers to talk to.

1:01:16.106 --> 1:01:19.307
(phone buzzing)

1:01:19.343 --> 1:01:21.243
Hello, Reverend Olson?

1:01:23.614 --> 1:01:25.781
I'm so sorry to hear that.

1:01:25.816 --> 1:01:29.885
No, no, no it's okay,
you can just get well.

1:01:30.721 --> 1:01:33.188
Okay. (sighs)

1:01:43.534 --> 1:01:45.267
- We told them 1300 hours.

1:01:45.302 --> 1:01:48.270
- Not everyone runs on
military time, Major.

1:01:48.305 --> 1:01:49.438
They'll be here.

1:01:49.540 --> 1:01:53.875
- Well, there are still a few
things we need to finalize.

1:01:53.911 --> 1:01:55.610
- I've got everything covered.

1:01:55.646 --> 1:01:57.746
But you're welcome to
help if you'd like.

1:01:57.781 --> 1:01:59.414
- Can you imagine
if they were trying

1:01:59.450 --> 1:02:01.149
to do this on their own?

1:02:01.185 --> 1:02:03.318
- I need a trip to the ladies'.

1:02:03.353 --> 1:02:05.320
If the waiter comes
by, order me a salad?

1:02:05.355 --> 1:02:09.357
- Oh, hold up, girl,
I'm gonna go with you.

1:02:16.834 --> 1:02:19.101
- Okay, just lost the
minister to the flu.

1:02:19.136 --> 1:02:22.237
- He was so sorry, but
he sounded sick as a dog.

1:02:22.272 --> 1:02:24.473
- It's okay, we'll get
somebody else, it'll be fine.

1:02:24.508 --> 1:02:26.274
- By tomorrow?

1:02:26.310 --> 1:02:29.077
Forget that the caterer
didn't get the final menu,

1:02:29.113 --> 1:02:31.179
or rather he got
two final menus.

1:02:31.215 --> 1:02:33.715
- Why would he have two final.

1:02:33.751 --> 1:02:35.550
Let me guess, my
mom and Isabelle?

1:02:35.586 --> 1:02:37.219
- I thought you were
handling this, Clay?

1:02:37.254 --> 1:02:39.454
- Laurel, I've been
juggling everything else.

1:02:39.490 --> 1:02:40.555
I can't be everywhere.

1:02:40.591 --> 1:02:42.257
- Well, I can't either.

1:02:42.292 --> 1:02:44.726
Playing referee on every detail,

1:02:44.762 --> 1:02:47.496
the decorations, the
music, the food, the cakes.

1:02:47.531 --> 1:02:49.498
Did I mention we have two cakes?

1:02:49.533 --> 1:02:50.599
- Two?

1:02:50.701 --> 1:02:52.934
- Yeah, one's perfect if we
were in the royal family.

1:02:52.970 --> 1:02:54.536
The other if we
were getting married

1:02:54.571 --> 1:02:56.471
at the Grand Ole Opry.

1:02:56.507 --> 1:02:57.305
- Okay.

1:02:57.341 --> 1:02:58.607
- (sighing) It's
all falling apart.

1:02:58.642 --> 1:03:00.509
Our folks aren't getting along.

1:03:00.544 --> 1:03:02.210
Nobody's on the same page.

1:03:02.246 --> 1:03:04.379
- Let's just, let's
get through tomorrow.

1:03:04.414 --> 1:03:06.782
- I don't wanna
just get through it.

1:03:06.817 --> 1:03:08.683
I want to enjoy it.

1:03:08.719 --> 1:03:11.453
- I know, I know, I know, okay.

1:03:11.488 --> 1:03:13.588
I'm gonna skip lunch,
make a few phone calls.

1:03:13.624 --> 1:03:15.056
- What's the point?

1:03:15.092 --> 1:03:18.426
With no minister,
there's no wedding.

1:03:18.462 --> 1:03:23.598
I don't know, maybe I am just
at the end of my rope, or,

1:03:25.602 --> 1:03:26.701
maybe this is a sign.

1:03:26.737 --> 1:03:30.672
- Sweetie, I promise you
everything is going to be fine.

1:03:30.707 --> 1:03:32.641
Okay, I'll take care of it.

1:03:32.676 --> 1:03:35.443
- I'm sorry, Clay, I
can't do this right now.

1:03:35.479 --> 1:03:38.246
Please apologize for me.

1:03:38.282 --> 1:03:39.147
- Laurel.

1:03:41.385 --> 1:03:44.019
Laurel (sighing).

1:03:44.054 --> 1:03:47.756
(curious woodwind music)

1:03:51.428 --> 1:03:54.095
- Are you sure that's
what they said?

1:03:54.131 --> 1:03:54.830
- Uh-huh.

1:03:54.865 --> 1:03:56.031
- A hundred percent.

1:03:56.066 --> 1:03:58.466
- It's a shame its
gotten to this point.

1:03:58.502 --> 1:04:01.503
- It didn't happen on its own.

1:04:01.538 --> 1:04:04.406
I don't think any of
us helped matters.

1:04:04.441 --> 1:04:07.442
- Now that, we can all agree on.

1:04:07.477 --> 1:04:11.513
- Isabelle, I'm sorry if I
steamrolled you a little bit.

1:04:11.548 --> 1:04:13.748
- And I'm sorry if
I steamrolled you.

1:04:13.784 --> 1:04:17.786
- I think it's cute you
thought you might have.

1:04:17.821 --> 1:04:20.422
- I feel awful about all this.

1:04:20.457 --> 1:04:21.523
- Me too.

1:04:21.558 --> 1:04:23.558
- Well, we made this mess,

1:04:23.594 --> 1:04:27.629
now what are we gonna
do to straighten it out?

1:04:31.268 --> 1:04:33.134
- Mr. Franklin.
- Hello, Clay.

1:04:33.170 --> 1:04:34.970
How are you?
- Good, how are you?

1:04:35.005 --> 1:04:36.671
- Oh, I'm doing well, now if
you're looking for Laurel,

1:04:36.707 --> 1:04:38.039
she's gone for the day.

1:04:38.075 --> 1:04:40.175
- No sir, actually I was
hoping to talk to you.

1:04:40.210 --> 1:04:41.076
Do you have a moment?

1:04:41.111 --> 1:04:43.178
- Well for you, always.

1:04:44.147 --> 1:04:45.513
So what's on your mind?

1:04:45.549 --> 1:04:47.816
- Well, I need some advice.

1:04:48.719 --> 1:04:50.518
- Oh well, I'll try.

1:04:50.554 --> 1:04:53.488
- You and Glenda have had
this wonderful marriage.

1:04:53.523 --> 1:04:55.390
And Laurel and I.

1:04:55.425 --> 1:04:56.625
The truth is, I don't
know where we stand

1:04:56.660 --> 1:04:58.593
with this wedding right now.

1:04:58.629 --> 1:04:59.594
I mean, we've been
bending over backwards

1:04:59.630 --> 1:05:02.497
to please her parents,
to please my parents.

1:05:02.532 --> 1:05:05.667
- And now, you and Laurel
are, you're feeling torn?

1:05:05.702 --> 1:05:06.902
Right?
- Yes.

1:05:06.970 --> 1:05:10.672
Her dad, Isabelle, my parents,
everyone has a different idea

1:05:10.707 --> 1:05:12.207
about what this
wedding should be.

1:05:12.242 --> 1:05:13.408
- Well, I'm sure.

1:05:13.443 --> 1:05:16.411
Like they say, you don't
marry just the person,

1:05:16.446 --> 1:05:17.545
you marry their whole family.

1:05:17.581 --> 1:05:20.515
- And I love her family, I
want them to be happy too.

1:05:20.550 --> 1:05:21.683
- Well of course,
you're a good man,

1:05:21.752 --> 1:05:24.552
and I've known that since the
first moment I've met you.

1:05:24.588 --> 1:05:27.822
But, that doesn't solve
everything, does it?

1:05:27.858 --> 1:05:28.723
- No.

1:05:29.960 --> 1:05:33.128
- You know, I've got this
theory about weddings.

1:05:33.163 --> 1:05:35.797
That weddings are a test
that couples have to pass.

1:05:35.832 --> 1:05:38.400
All that planning,
and stress, and strain

1:05:38.435 --> 1:05:41.336
it pushes couples to see
if they're really ready.

1:05:41.371 --> 1:05:43.538
- I thought we were,
I think we are.

1:05:43.573 --> 1:05:45.540
- But love is complicated.

1:05:45.575 --> 1:05:48.777
I understand that some people
even write songs about it.

1:05:48.812 --> 1:05:52.047
But it boils down to this,
it doesn't really matter

1:05:52.082 --> 1:05:55.517
what anybody else thinKs or
what everybody else things,

1:05:55.552 --> 1:05:58.353
because it's your
day and Laurel's day,

1:05:58.388 --> 1:06:01.022
so make it what you
and Laurel want.

1:06:01.058 --> 1:06:02.390
Because when all
is said and done,

1:06:02.426 --> 1:06:04.259
and everybody else goes home,

1:06:04.294 --> 1:06:07.429
it's just you and
Laurel, and Emma.

1:06:08.632 --> 1:06:10.865
- That's really good
advice for a banker.

1:06:10.901 --> 1:06:13.601
- I haven't always been
a banker, you know.

1:06:13.637 --> 1:06:14.736
You know, actually
back in the day,

1:06:14.771 --> 1:06:16.938
I was a chaplain in the army.

1:06:16.974 --> 1:06:18.340
- Is that so?

1:06:18.375 --> 1:06:20.875
- So trust me, I have heard
it and I've seen it all.

1:06:20.911 --> 1:06:22.744
But let me ask you one question,

1:06:22.779 --> 1:06:25.313
are you crazy about Laurel?

1:06:25.349 --> 1:06:26.648
- Yes.

1:06:26.683 --> 1:06:30.552
- Well good, because I
know she's crazy about you,

1:06:30.587 --> 1:06:32.554
and as long as the
two of you stay crazy

1:06:32.589 --> 1:06:36.191
about each other, you
can handle anything.

1:06:38.762 --> 1:06:40.228
- I appreciate the advice.

1:06:40.263 --> 1:06:41.763
- I hope it helps.

♪ And called you sweet love

1:07:26.443 --> 1:07:27.108
- [Laurel] Hey daddy.

1:07:27.144 --> 1:07:29.911
- Hey, sweetheart come on in.

1:07:33.884 --> 1:07:35.984
- So you wanted to talk?

1:07:36.953 --> 1:07:38.053
- Yeah.

1:07:40.724 --> 1:07:43.758
You want something to drink?
- Sure.

1:07:43.794 --> 1:07:45.660
- Got some water here
with fruit in it.

1:07:45.695 --> 1:07:47.462

1:07:47.497 --> 1:07:49.931

1:07:49.966 --> 1:07:52.100
- So, where is Isabelle.

1:07:52.135 --> 1:07:55.570
- She is downstairs
in the lobby eating

1:07:55.605 --> 1:07:59.007
a peanut butter and
banana sandwich.

1:07:59.042 --> 1:08:00.141
- Thank you.

1:08:01.778 --> 1:08:02.911
- So, I wanted.

1:08:04.581 --> 1:08:07.682
I just thought it
would be best if.

1:08:08.652 --> 1:08:11.719
Communication is
not my strong suit.

1:08:11.755 --> 1:08:14.923
- Your mother, she always
knew exactly what to say.

1:08:14.958 --> 1:08:19.094
She knew just what to
say, just what to do.

1:08:19.129 --> 1:08:21.229
You are so much
like her, you know.

1:08:21.264 --> 1:08:23.264
You got your talent from her.

1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:27.035
Your beautiful voice,
love of performing.

1:08:27.804 --> 1:08:30.839
She loved music
as much as you do.

1:08:30.874 --> 1:08:34.509
But all her hopes and
dreams and waiting

1:08:36.346 --> 1:08:40.281
for the luck that never
came hurt her deeply.

1:08:43.086 --> 1:08:47.021
And all I could do was
sit there and watch.

1:08:47.858 --> 1:08:52.026
And I just could bear to
see that happen to you.

1:08:53.530 --> 1:08:56.664
- That's why you didn't
come hear me sing?

1:08:56.700 --> 1:09:02.003
Why you were so determined for
me to go to business school?

1:09:02.539 --> 1:09:03.004
- Yeah.

1:09:04.674 --> 1:09:05.974
And I was wrong.

1:09:06.009 --> 1:09:09.077
- Dad, I love my
life and my job.

1:09:12.916 --> 1:09:14.983
And I love music too.

1:09:15.886 --> 1:09:18.052
Clay, he completes me.

1:09:21.825 --> 1:09:25.960
Can't there be room for
everything that makes me happy?

1:09:25.996 --> 1:09:27.195
- Absolutely.

1:09:31.368 --> 1:09:33.501
And I'm so sorry, honey.

1:09:34.638 --> 1:09:39.007
I've been a hindrance instead
of a help, but no more.

1:09:39.042 --> 1:09:44.012
You wanna sing, I'll be at
every single show from now on.

1:09:46.016 --> 1:09:48.016
You can depend on that.

1:09:48.818 --> 1:09:50.518
- I love you, daddy.

1:09:52.622 --> 1:09:56.224
- Oh, I love you too,
sweetheart, so much.

1:09:57.227 --> 1:09:58.193
- And Clay?

1:10:03.867 --> 1:10:06.067
- He's a good man.
- He is.

1:10:08.004 --> 1:10:10.638
- I might've been a
little hard on him.

1:10:10.674 --> 1:10:13.775
He can sure say how
much he loves you.

1:10:13.810 --> 1:10:14.676
And Emma.

1:10:15.812 --> 1:10:19.781
And if your momma was here,
I know just what she'd say.

1:10:19.816 --> 1:10:22.884
She'd say there is no
better man on this Earth

1:10:22.919 --> 1:10:24.652
for our baby girl.

1:10:25.655 --> 1:10:28.223
- Thank you, dad, thank you.

1:10:36.700 --> 1:10:38.266
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

1:10:38.301 --> 1:10:41.069
- I got a call.
- I got a call.

1:10:41.871 --> 1:10:43.605
- My parents wanted to talk.

1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:46.941
- My dad too, and he
wasn't the Major this time.

1:10:46.977 --> 1:10:48.109
He was dad.

1:10:50.580 --> 1:10:51.813
- Yeah, I don't know
what's going on.

1:10:51.848 --> 1:10:54.382
My mom's even rethinking
the whole doves thing.

1:10:54.417 --> 1:10:55.583
- And Isabelle's
agreed to compromise

1:10:55.619 --> 1:10:58.119
on decorations, it's weird.

1:10:59.923 --> 1:11:02.790
- So, you still wanna marry me?

1:11:03.526 --> 1:11:04.359
- Hmm.

1:11:06.096 --> 1:11:07.295
Absolutely.

1:11:11.768 --> 1:11:14.469
Wait, we still don't
have a minister.

1:11:14.504 --> 1:11:17.005
- I think I got that handled.

1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:20.208
- Hmm.
(Clay laughing)

1:11:25.682 --> 1:11:27.582
- Sunny day, clear skies.

1:11:27.617 --> 1:11:29.917
- It's because we buried
that bottle of bourbon.

1:11:29.953 --> 1:11:33.821
Never doubt your mom's old
Southern traditions, son.

1:11:33.857 --> 1:11:34.822
- Yes, sir.

1:11:36.359 --> 1:11:38.259
- I'm so proud of you.

1:11:40.830 --> 1:11:42.297
- Love you, pop.

1:11:45.969 --> 1:11:49.404
- Do I look all right,
the hair, the makeup?

1:11:49.439 --> 1:11:54.075
- The most gorgeous bride we
have ever seen, right Trish?

1:11:54.110 --> 1:11:56.444
- No argument here, ever again.

1:11:56.479 --> 1:11:58.313
- How do I look, mom?

1:11:59.182 --> 1:12:02.550
- Pretty as a picture,
come here baby.

1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:05.386
Beautiful.
- Thank you.

1:12:05.422 --> 1:12:07.121
- All right, now
there goes my makeup.

1:12:07.157 --> 1:12:10.792
- Okay, you two, we have to
get the finishing touches on.

1:12:10.827 --> 1:12:13.394
- All right, Miss Emma, let's
go on down to the chapel.

1:12:13.430 --> 1:12:15.063
See you in a little bit.

1:12:15.098 --> 1:12:16.331
Come on, hon.

1:12:19.469 --> 1:12:21.869
- I'm sorry, these
past couple of weeks

1:12:21.905 --> 1:12:23.604
have been so crazy.

1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:25.873
We really haven't had
much time to talk.

1:12:25.909 --> 1:12:27.141
- I'm the one who's sorry.

1:12:27.177 --> 1:12:27.842
- Isabelle?

1:12:27.877 --> 1:12:30.578
- I think I just wanted to help.

1:12:30.613 --> 1:12:33.314
To be a part of your life.

1:12:33.350 --> 1:12:36.484
- You are, forever,
we're family.

1:12:37.354 --> 1:12:39.220
- That's all I wanted.

1:12:39.255 --> 1:12:42.890
So, I wanted to lend you
something for your wedding,

1:12:42.926 --> 1:12:45.026
if you want it, that is.

1:12:46.363 --> 1:12:49.297
My mother wore this
at her wedding,

1:12:49.332 --> 1:12:51.866
and she always said
it brought her luck.

1:12:51.901 --> 1:12:56.371
So, if you don't already have
something borrowed or blue,

1:12:56.406 --> 1:12:59.774
I would be honored
if you would wear it.

1:12:59.809 --> 1:13:01.776
- I'd be so proud to.

1:13:01.811 --> 1:13:04.312
- I know I can never
replace your mother,

1:13:04.347 --> 1:13:06.414
and I wouldn't presume to try,

1:13:06.449 --> 1:13:10.618
but if you ever need
anything, I'm always here.

1:13:11.454 --> 1:13:13.321
Always ready to help.

1:13:13.356 --> 1:13:16.124
- You have no idea how
much that means to me,

1:13:16.159 --> 1:13:18.926
you truly don't.
- Oh, thank you.

1:13:23.166 --> 1:13:25.600
- You did remember to get
a minister, didn't you?

1:13:25.635 --> 1:13:27.135
- Oh, he's here.

1:13:29.873 --> 1:13:30.972
Good to see you, Chaplain.

1:13:31.007 --> 1:13:32.507
- Good to see you.
- Thanks for being here.

1:13:32.542 --> 1:13:34.075
- No, thank you.

1:13:34.110 --> 1:13:37.445
(gentle guitar music)

1:14:16.419 --> 1:14:19.754
- I love you, daddy.
- I love you too.

1:14:25.495 --> 1:14:26.694
- We made it.

1:14:27.664 --> 1:14:29.797
- Wow, you look amazing.

1:14:30.567 --> 1:14:32.467
- You don't look
too bad yourself.

1:14:32.502 --> 1:14:35.203
- You may be seated everyone.

1:14:37.307 --> 1:14:39.774
Friends, family, old and new,

1:14:41.244 --> 1:14:43.110
we're gathered here at
our beloved Graceland

1:14:43.146 --> 1:14:46.747
in this beautiful chapel
surrounded by the spirit of love

1:14:46.783 --> 1:14:49.917
to join together Laurel
Couper and Clay Sheppard

1:14:49.953 --> 1:14:51.819
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

1:14:51.855 --> 1:14:53.387
Now, I could go on
quite a while about

1:14:53.423 --> 1:14:55.623
what a perfect couple
these young people are,

1:14:55.658 --> 1:14:58.860
but Laurel and Clay asked
me to keep it simple,

1:14:58.895 --> 1:15:00.928
especially after the
last couple of weeks.

1:15:00.964 --> 1:15:03.664
(audience laughing)

1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:05.233
Now, at this point
in the service,

1:15:05.268 --> 1:15:07.635
I would like to turn it
over to Laurel and Clay,

1:15:07.670 --> 1:15:09.604
and the vows that
they have written.

1:15:09.639 --> 1:15:10.571
Clay?

1:15:10.607 --> 1:15:12.974
- Laurel, I knew how
special you were to me

1:15:13.009 --> 1:15:16.744
ever since the moment
you put gum in my hair.

1:15:16.779 --> 1:15:20.214
It was in third grade.
(laughing)

1:15:20.250 --> 1:15:24.919
I let you get away once and
fate brought you back to me,

1:15:24.954 --> 1:15:26.554
and I will never
let you go again.

1:15:26.589 --> 1:15:29.590
So from this day forth,
I will cheer you up

1:15:29.626 --> 1:15:30.725
in the bad times.

1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:33.261
I will celebrate
you in the good.

1:15:33.296 --> 1:15:36.998
And I will harmonize
with you when you sing.

1:15:37.033 --> 1:15:39.166
All the days of my life.

1:15:40.270 --> 1:15:41.702
It's your turn.

1:15:41.738 --> 1:15:44.839
- First, I gotta
say I was framed.

1:15:44.874 --> 1:15:47.975
It was Anna Mae Cowan
who put gum in your hair.

1:15:48.011 --> 1:15:49.510
Just to set the record straight.

1:15:49.546 --> 1:15:51.245
(laughing)

1:15:51.281 --> 1:15:55.283
Clay, you've always been
able to make me smile

1:15:55.985 --> 1:15:57.351
just by being there,

1:15:57.387 --> 1:16:02.690
whether it was at school,
backstage when I was nervous,

1:16:02.725 --> 1:16:04.225
or here right now.

1:16:05.461 --> 1:16:09.297
That's just one of
millions of reasons why

1:16:09.332 --> 1:16:12.733
I can't wait to spend
our life together.

1:16:13.703 --> 1:16:16.537
And we don't have time
for a million reasons,

1:16:16.573 --> 1:16:19.006
so let me just
give you one more.

1:16:19.042 --> 1:16:22.443
The simple fact is, I
love you, Clay Sheppard,

1:16:22.478 --> 1:16:24.712
always have, always will.

1:16:27.717 --> 1:16:29.817
- May we have the rings.

1:16:31.054 --> 1:16:32.653
- Thank you, Ted.

1:16:33.790 --> 1:16:35.189
- Now, if you'll repeat after--

1:16:35.224 --> 1:16:37.558
- If you don't mind, I
waited a long time for this,

1:16:37.594 --> 1:16:39.493
so let's just cut to the chase.

1:16:39.529 --> 1:16:40.394
I do.

1:16:41.831 --> 1:16:43.464
- And I do.

1:16:43.499 --> 1:16:45.666
- Well, that's that, then.

1:16:45.702 --> 1:16:48.069
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1:16:48.104 --> 1:16:49.604
And you may now kiss the bride

1:16:49.639 --> 1:16:51.772
as I think they already
know, don't you?

1:16:51.808 --> 1:16:57.011

1:17:29.445 --> 1:17:32.446
- Yeah, oh, and my mom's
planning our honeymoon.

1:17:32.482 --> 1:17:34.181
She had some great ideas.

1:17:34.217 --> 1:17:35.716

1:18:20.296 --> 1:18:22.630
He was able to pull

and get just the right performer
