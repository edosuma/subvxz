WEBVTT

01:10.028 --> 01:11.064
Can I help you?

01:11.780 --> 01:14.648
I'm lookin', uh, for Ben Aronoff.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.160
I'm afraid he's not in.

01:17.162 --> 01:18.196
Huh.

01:20.664 --> 01:23.657
I've been trying to reach him for a week,
but he hasn't gotten back to me.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.493
I call, and I call, and I call.

01:28.505 --> 01:33.250
Now, look,
my boss is a very wealthy man

01:33.343 --> 01:36.336
who wants to buy a boat.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.173
And he wants to buy the boat
before he goes back to Michigan.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.508
Now, look, I'm just trying
to give this man some money.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.600
I'm Ben.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.812
Why don't you bring your boss in?

01:46.898 --> 01:49.891
We'll show him some boats,
and he can see what he likes.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.488
My boss...

01:56.116 --> 01:57.232
took me from the gutter,

01:58.702 --> 01:59.738
gave me a job.

02:01.330 --> 02:05.290
Everything I have, everything I am,
I owe to him.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.791
I'd do anything for my boss.

02:09.253 --> 02:12.167
Anything... and everything.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.801
I'd never turn my back on my boss.

02:20.349 --> 02:23.183
You tell your boss that I'm done.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.850
I don't owe anybody anything.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.062
I'm paid in full and more so.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.111
You tell him that.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.068
Okay. I'll tell him.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.493
I'll tell him every word.

03:42.764 --> 03:43.764
Hey, Ben.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.141
<i>You couldn't build
a fuckin' outhouse right now</i>

03:50.188 --> 03:52.180
<i>without somebody
blowing up your goddamned car!</i>

03:52.274 --> 03:55.017
Irv, calm the fuck down
and just tell me what happened.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.067
<i>It's over! The war's over. We lost, man.</i>

03:57.154 --> 03:58.861
No. No, what did Lansky say?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.063
<i>You don't get it!</i>

04:00.449 --> 04:01.565
What did he say?

04:01.658 --> 04:03.399
<i>We're done! We're out of business, Ben!</i>

04:03.493 --> 04:06.986
<i>We lost the union!
You still got your cash, right?</i>

04:07.080 --> 04:08.912
Son of a bitch.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.615
<i>- What's that?</i>
- I got it.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.079
<i>You've always been a lucky bastard.</i>

04:13.587 --> 04:15.078
<i>Now, grab your family and your money,</i>

04:15.172 --> 04:17.664
<i>and get the hell out
before things get any worse!</i>

04:20.677 --> 04:25.763
<i>I'm Ben Aronoff, contractor,
entrepreneur, husband, father,</i>

04:25.849 --> 04:27.056
<i>and out of business.</i>

05:04.888 --> 05:07.631
We are done with winters in New Jersey.

05:08.683 --> 05:09.924
New start, babe.

05:11.228 --> 05:15.222
What about our house, Ben,
and the construction business?

05:16.691 --> 05:17.977
We outgrew it.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.851
Coney Island, New Jersey...

05:22.697 --> 05:25.940
It's a new beginning, Mrs. Aronoff.
We're in Florida.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.070
New life.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.700
I'm not sure what was wrong
with our old life.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.953
You're swinging with Tarzan now. Hang on.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.585
I'm going down to the front desk
to square some things away.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.518
Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Keep it down.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.940
You two over there, Melissa in this bed.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.695
Settle down.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.609
I'm coming back in two minutes,
turning off the lights.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.735
- Hey.
- Bourbon, neat.

06:16.835 --> 06:17.871
You got it.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.683
Two Millers and a highball.

06:34.769 --> 06:35.769
You got it.

06:35.812 --> 06:39.271
Well, if I had known that you were
working, I'd have taken a table.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.558
It's never too late.

06:43.361 --> 06:47.275
- The king of construction, Big Ben.
- Jules!

06:47.365 --> 06:51.450
<i>Now, this guy is Jules Bergman,
Meyer Lansky's main man.</i>

06:51.536 --> 06:53.368
<i>Very connected and very dangerous.</i>

06:53.455 --> 06:56.072
- How are ya?
- Welcome to Miami.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.203
- Thank you.
- Find everything? Family good?

06:58.293 --> 07:00.751
Yes. Yes. We're all settled in upstairs,

07:00.837 --> 07:02.703
and I thank you for the arrangements.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.914
Of course.

07:05.008 --> 07:08.718
They tell me you built
100 houses in one suburb

07:08.803 --> 07:11.136
from dirt to sold in under four months?

07:11.431 --> 07:14.048
More than once. Drove the banks crazy.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.179
Wow. Let's have a seat.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.437
Sure.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.902
So you call me when you're ready
and I'll get you in front of the old man.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.239
Well, how is he?

07:29.658 --> 07:33.618
When Castro came back to Havana
and stole Mr. Lansky's casino,

07:34.287 --> 07:35.403
who took care of me?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.242
Who got me off the island?

07:37.874 --> 07:40.582
If you cut open Mr. Lansky's heart,

07:41.336 --> 07:43.373
he would bleed only loyalty.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.172
To you too, Ben.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.837
You know, I appreciate that.
I appreciate all of it, but I...

07:49.302 --> 07:51.339
I want to do something
on my own here, you know?

07:51.429 --> 07:53.045
A new town, new beginning.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.137
Like the second game of a doubleheader.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.557
So what are your plans?

08:00.897 --> 08:03.640
Like usual, to win.

08:04.818 --> 08:05.818
Okay.

08:07.696 --> 08:08.982
You call me when you're ready.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.364
- Good seeing ya.
- Good to see you.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.035
Thanks.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.122
So, you still want that table?

08:25.547 --> 08:26.583

Ben?

09:03.460 --> 09:04.621
Shelley?

09:04.711 --> 09:06.122
Shelley Katz, real-estate law.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.626
<i>Yep, he was a small-time lawyer,
but I needed someone hungry.</i>

09:09.716 --> 09:12.880
- How are ya?
- I'm great. Here's my card.

09:14.304 --> 09:18.264
So do you, uh, make the laws
or do you figure out ways to break 'em?

09:19.309 --> 09:21.141
Scotch rocks.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.725
I make, I break. I just don't do floors.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.014
And what about you, Mr. Big Shot?

09:27.108 --> 09:28.394
No, I checked up on you.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.818
Giant shopping centers,
entire neighborhoods.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.271
What are you planning for Miami? Pyramids?

09:33.615 --> 09:35.072
Just looking for opportunities.

09:35.283 --> 09:39.152
Well, then, for the record,
beyond my hourly rate,

09:39.245 --> 09:41.032
I take 5% of any deal we close.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.660
I'm a lot more than purchase agreements
and deeds of trust.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.334
Three percent.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.091
Okay.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.711

do you think should be there?

12:06.517 --> 12:08.304
- Who?
- Yours, silly!

12:13.066 --> 12:14.066
What do you think?

12:15.443 --> 12:19.904
- Yeah, it is kinda sexy.
- Yeah. It is.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.283
<i>Now, this, here, was my first race</i>

12:28.373 --> 12:32.617
<i>against a bunch of rich fat cats

12:45.390 --> 12:47.347
That's the suckers
we gotta beat right there.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.388
Bet they never wrestled
a kid from Brooklyn College.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.051
- Keep the throttle down! Let's go for it!
- I'm on it!

13:36.357 --> 13:37.357
We're doing it!

13:38.067 --> 13:40.024

14:06.888 --> 14:09.631
What was that? Oh!

14:10.058 --> 14:11.738
Hold on,
I'm gonna check the back.

14:12.769 --> 14:13.805
Keep her straight.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.680
Ah, no. God. She's toast.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.812
Okay, forget it. Fine, you know what?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.227
It's fantastic.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.567
Forget the motor, forget everything.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.363

It's the kind of sexy toy

14:56.187 --> 14:59.476

and you open another.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.024
A new company with a new vision.

15:02.402 --> 15:07.113
We're building boats that, well,
they push the envelope and break barriers.

15:07.198 --> 15:10.441
Daring, defiant,
and, of course, they're irresistible.

15:10.535 --> 15:13.778
If you want to cross
the finish line first, buy a Donzi.

15:14.372 --> 15:17.831
<i>It's a glorious day here

<i>at the front of the pack.</i>

15:27.927 --> 15:32.092
Mr. Aronoff, tell us about
that first win from Miami to Nassau.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.638
Well, if you really want to win,

15:33.724 --> 15:36.717
sometimes you have to take a chance,
let it all hang out.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.019
As the kids say, it's gotta be your bag.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.901
<i>As the leaders
approach Nassau, it's Bertram,</i>

15:49.991 --> 15:52.654
<i>Webb, and Ben Aronoff.</i>

16:08.885 --> 16:11.878
<i>The racers make the turn
to clear the outside of the island,</i>

16:11.971 --> 16:15.840
<i>and, oh, my!
That's Aronoff placing a big bet,</i>

16:15.933 --> 16:18.300
<i>risking it all on a shortcut
through the shore,</i>

16:18.394 --> 16:20.977

18:58.554 --> 18:59.761
Catch!

19:01.057 --> 19:03.299
Nice spiral, Joe Namath!

19:03.392 --> 19:04.392
Wanna come play with us?

19:05.227 --> 19:07.014
Later. I gotta find your mom.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.727
Oh, wonderful of you to show up.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.985
It got so late last night,
I just stayed at Knocky's.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.570
Yesterday's race,
I think I broke something.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.617
Yes, you did.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.415
Excuse me.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.724
The woman has a tattoo
of Elvis on both thighs,

19:50.022 --> 19:52.765
and she's not convinced
that it looks like Elvis.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.851
So she goes out in the street,
she finds a drunk,

19:56.320 --> 19:58.903
and she lifts up her skirt,
and she says to the drunk,

19:58.989 --> 20:00.321
"Do you recognize these guys?"

20:00.408 --> 20:04.448
And the drunk says,
"I don't know who the twins are,

20:04.537 --> 20:07.029
but the guy in the middle
is definitely Willie Nelson."

20:10.084 --> 20:13.327
I need a drink.
A good joke always makes me thirsty.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.579
Ben, somebody wants to see you.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.264
Mr. Lansky.

20:27.351 --> 20:31.140
<i>Meyer Lansky,
the financial wizard of organized crime.</i>

20:31.230 --> 20:33.222
<i>When he called, you answered.</i>

20:33.733 --> 20:35.975
- Ben Aronoff of Sheepshead Bay.
- How are ya?

20:36.068 --> 20:39.482
- All right. You look good.
- Oh, thanks.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.781
Real good. I've been keeping up with you.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.483
- Oh?
- Yeah.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.365
Our box houses in Jersey
must feel like ages ago

20:47.788 --> 20:50.030
and not nearly as sexy
as those boats of yours.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.790
Build boats, build homes, same thing.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.085
- Not according to my nephew.
- Is that right?

20:55.171 --> 20:56.958
He's gaga for those powerboats of yours.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.047
And those ads.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.176
Hey, Robbie!

21:02.094 --> 21:05.713
<i>That's Robbie Reemer,
Meyer Lansky's little asshole nephew.</i>

21:05.806 --> 21:07.593
Tell us why you like Ben Aronoff.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.675
Because Ben Aronoff has everything!

21:11.896 --> 21:12.932
See?

21:16.901 --> 21:18.437
Still remember Jacob, your father.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.937
He'd be proud of you
selling to that hoity-toity crowd.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.980
Making a stir, making a buck.

21:26.327 --> 21:27.327
But on your own?

21:29.789 --> 21:30.905
New beginnings?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.124
That's crap.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.038
Not wanting to be a bother?

21:37.171 --> 21:38.207
More crap.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.879
We're your family, Benny.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.506
These are your people.

21:45.596 --> 21:48.589
Sometimes you just want
to do some things on your own.

21:53.187 --> 21:56.430
You do that when it
comes to banging shiksas

21:56.524 --> 21:57.731
and betting the ponies.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.187
You don't put
that bullshit in front of me.

22:04.198 --> 22:07.236
You ever seen a head all swelled up?
That's you.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.239
Not good for a goddamn thing.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.530
Don't remember who you are
or where you came from.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.725
Hey. Are you kidding me?

22:33.811 --> 22:35.393
You know him? You know Meyer Lansky?

22:35.479 --> 22:37.892
Oh, fuck Lansky!
I've worked too hard, Shelley,

22:37.982 --> 22:39.769
for him to come in the middle of our shit.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.600
We've got too many big things coming in.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.289
<i>Aronoff's revolutionary Cigarette</i>

23:59.313 --> 24:01.851
<i>has taken offshore powerboat racing
by storm.</i>

24:01.941 --> 24:04.024
<i>At each stop on the European circuit,</i>

24:04.109 --> 24:06.101
<i>the Cigarette has burned through
the record books,</i>

24:06.195 --> 24:08.733
<i>shattering every mark for time and speed.</i>

24:09.573 --> 24:12.316
<i>Up to a fantastic 66 miles an hour,</i>

24:12.409 --> 24:15.402
<i>13 miles an hour faster than
the record set three years ago.</i>

24:15.496 --> 24:20.457
Boats are sex symbols, and, certainly,
the Cigarette boat is a sexy boat,

24:20.542 --> 24:22.204
but we don't market it that way.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.347
It's a man's boat,
and it's a dangerous machine.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.728
<i>And there's Ben Aronoff
speeding home,</i>

24:42.815 --> 24:45.432
<i>heading towards
his seventh victory this season.</i>

24:45.526 --> 24:48.894
<i>One more and he reclaims
the world championship.</i>

25:06.630 --> 25:07.746
Mmm.

25:15.389 --> 25:19.508
My husband would like
to purchase two Cigarette boats.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.017
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

25:22.438 --> 25:25.431
Well, for you,
I'll have to charge him double.

25:30.446 --> 25:34.315
You know, I would have to come
to America, pick them up.

25:34.908 --> 25:35.908
Could you?

25:40.748 --> 25:43.491
Does it ever get cold in, uh, Florida?

25:43.959 --> 25:45.871
Very.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.121
But I could always use some warmth

25:50.090 --> 25:53.128
of the... Tuscan... sun.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.633
Hey, Ben.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.135
Shelley?

26:01.268 --> 26:02.537
I've been lookin' all over for ya.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.224
- Who is this man?
- He's my lawyer.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.600
We gotta talk.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.902
I'll be back. Don't you go.

26:16.825 --> 26:20.444
Now I didn't volunteer,
okay, to run your office,

26:20.537 --> 26:23.575
your business and your family,
for Christ's sake.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.116
I'm just a lawyer, remember?

26:26.585 --> 26:29.077
You flew 3,000 miles to complain?

26:29.171 --> 26:30.787
What are you doing here, Ben?

26:32.091 --> 26:33.673
What are you running away from? Lansky?

26:33.759 --> 26:35.591
I'm busting my ass for our company.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.294
Oh, oh, okay. Yeah, right. I can see that.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.596
Winning races sells boats, Shelley.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.827
Do you throw in the sex with every sale
or do they pay for that, too?

26:42.851 --> 26:46.094
- You better watch your fuckin' mouth.
- Oh, good. Great. Rip me to shreds, Ben,

26:46.188 --> 26:50.148
because then there will be
absolutely nobody running your company.

26:52.528 --> 26:53.735
I'm sorry.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.030
Yeah.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.902
I'm gonna win the world championship
at the end of this month, Shelley.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.871
That's big. It's very big.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.203
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

27:11.213 --> 27:13.296
By the way,
your son just got into college.

27:13.715 --> 27:14.876
He's leaving in a week.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.050
I just thought you'd like to know.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.050
I'll see you back in Florida.

28:34.838 --> 28:37.046
<i>I was losing something far more important.</i>

28:53.649 --> 28:54.935
Kathy.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.194
Andrew.

28:59.821 --> 29:02.905
He damaged his spine...
in the car accident.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.152
He's in surgery now.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.077
They say he may not make it.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.079
Don't worry. We'll get this right.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.460
We will get this right.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.704
Andy, you gotta fight through this.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.871
You need to stick around.

29:57.879 --> 30:01.372
You're an Aronoff.
We fight back. We battle.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.502
Okay, this is the deal.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.254
You're gonna get through this,
you're gonna get better,

30:08.765 --> 30:10.631
and you're gonna walk the hell outta here.

30:12.436 --> 30:13.436
You hear me?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.933
I'm gonna be here
all night with you, okay?

30:20.652 --> 30:23.440
I'll be right here.
I'm gonna sleep right there on the couch.

30:24.197 --> 30:27.110
I'm not going anywhere. Okay? Dad's back.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.328
Dad's back.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.333
Baby boy.

31:07.282 --> 31:12.323
Your son had to almost lose his life
to get his father's attention.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.870
What do the rest of us have to do?

31:23.090 --> 31:24.090
Come on.

31:24.925 --> 31:25.925
Come on.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.404
- You got a lot of friends, Ben.
- Do I?

32:02.003 --> 32:03.369
How is he? How's Andrew?

32:06.758 --> 32:08.750
They told me he'll never walk again.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.548
Oh, God.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.174
I mean, he's here, though, right?

32:21.523 --> 32:23.264
He's a tough kid. He'll battle back.

32:24.985 --> 32:27.147
Kathy and I are through. Done.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.196
A long time ago, Ben.

32:33.743 --> 32:36.326
So, how are we doing?

32:40.292 --> 32:41.703
What do you mean? Business-wise?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.079
- Yes.
- Oh.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.440
No, I'm not talking about that right now.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.921
Oh, yes, you are, Shelley.

32:47.007 --> 32:48.373
Actually, no, I'm not.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.835
Just tell me, how are we doing?
What are the numbers? Just tell me.

32:54.556 --> 32:57.596
Look, it's not like every time you win
a race, they gave you a million bucks,

32:58.268 --> 33:01.727
which is half of what it costs to run the
racing team across Europe for the summer.

33:04.816 --> 33:08.605
To be honest,
we can't sell enough hulls a year

33:08.695 --> 33:10.840
to keep the company afloat,
not the way we're running it.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.480
We're in a deep hole, Ben.

33:20.499 --> 33:21.499
Well...

33:22.834 --> 33:23.834
I'll fix it.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.164
Like I always do.

33:47.484 --> 33:51.899
<i>I knew where I had to go,
and he was waiting for me.</i>

33:53.532 --> 33:55.023
<i>I thought I got out,</i>

33:56.117 --> 33:57.608
<i>but you never get out.</i>

34:34.739 --> 34:35.946
Great to see you, Ben.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.745
<i>Someone else
was waiting for me, too.</i>

35:03.643 --> 35:05.225
Hell of a day out there, champ.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.854
But they're still
running the horses at noon.

35:09.357 --> 35:13.977
So, what do you say we burn a grand or two

35:14.529 --> 35:16.441
and remember what real beer tastes like?

35:20.201 --> 35:21.442
Andy.

35:22.662 --> 35:26.747
I'm telling ya, feeling sorry
for yourself ain't gonna work.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.163
You gotta get out there, boy.
You gotta live again.

35:32.714 --> 35:36.048
Come on, buddy. Let's go out.
Let's go out to the track.

35:39.721 --> 35:40.721
Okay, that's it.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.051
I fuckin' hate you!

36:03.578 --> 36:04.578
Well, I love you.

36:22.597 --> 36:23.597
What do I see?

36:24.349 --> 36:25.349
I see a smile?

36:26.559 --> 36:28.050
You know you're still fucking crazy?

36:28.853 --> 36:30.560
Yeah. I know that.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.097
Now let's go to the track.

36:35.068 --> 36:37.776
<i>And they're off!</i>

36:37.862 --> 36:39.023
Here we go!

36:39.698 --> 36:43.282
Here we go! Come on! Come on!

36:43.785 --> 36:48.325
Do it! Five! Come on! Five! Come on!

36:48.415 --> 36:52.455
- You got this!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

36:52.544 --> 36:53.955
Five! Come on!

36:54.504 --> 36:57.963
Yes! There it is! Look, look!
Look, look, look! We got it!

36:58.049 --> 36:59.256
Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

36:59.342 --> 37:01.629
Bring it home! Whoo!

37:01.720 --> 37:03.677
- That's it, baby!
- We got it!

37:06.266 --> 37:08.349
Come on, five!

37:15.525 --> 37:16.891
Whoo-hoo!

37:17.736 --> 37:19.773
Two wins today, buddy. Not bad.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.030
You like it?

37:23.199 --> 37:25.236
Yeah, what's not to like? It was fun.

37:25.326 --> 37:29.445
You know, I got a line
on a big stable up north in Ocala.

37:29.539 --> 37:31.246
What do you say we buy it?

37:31.332 --> 37:33.449
We fill it with thoroughbreds,

37:33.543 --> 37:35.205
and you run the whole damn thing.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.271
I don't know anything about horses, Dad.

37:39.299 --> 37:42.588
I didn't know anything
about boats or building houses.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.634
See this? See that?

37:48.933 --> 37:52.267
That was my whole year's salary
when I was a gym teacher in Brooklyn.

37:53.188 --> 37:54.850
How do you think I did that?

37:54.939 --> 37:56.396
How do you think I made that happen?

37:57.025 --> 38:00.143
I busted my ass
and I beat the fuckin' odds.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.861
So can you.

38:05.658 --> 38:08.321
- You really think so?
- Ah! I know so.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.870
<i>I was never really there for him,</i>

38:12.373 --> 38:17.243
<i>but I wanted to buy him some happiness,
and he took that money... and ran.</i>

38:23.676 --> 38:24.676
<i>Coño.</i>

38:31.810 --> 38:33.051
Top-of-the-line model.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.982
- How much?
- Retail, 32K.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.403
- You'll take 35?
- 45.

38:52.872 --> 38:56.206
Fuck it. We take together, pair.

38:56.292 --> 38:59.285
- Say, 80K.
- 100K.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.224
Okay.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.308
Ah.

39:14.394 --> 39:15.475
Deal.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.632
What do you want the title to be?

39:17.689 --> 39:21.228
Pick a name. A good one.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.938
Nobody wants to explain
where the cash came from.

39:24.779 --> 39:27.567
- Come with me.
- I like this guy.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.787
<i>And just like their drug-sniffing dogs,</i>

39:42.881 --> 39:44.838
<i>once the DEA got the scent,</i>

39:44.924 --> 39:46.290
<i>they were hard to shake.</i>

39:47.468 --> 39:49.004
Mr. Aronoff!

39:49.345 --> 39:50.927
Stuart Lopez, DEA.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.391
Nice boat!

39:54.809 --> 39:56.345
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.594
Office.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.475
I'll see you there.

40:04.611 --> 40:07.649
Look, no surprise to you, Mr. Aronoff.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.356
Cigarette boats are a big hit
on the drug-running circuit.

40:10.783 --> 40:13.150
Lately, we busted a lot of
smugglers driving your boats.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.244
My boats?

40:14.246 --> 40:16.407
I mean, boats manufactured
by your company.

40:16.497 --> 40:18.329
Ah, yes.

40:18.458 --> 40:21.951
The problem is the sales names are fiction
and the hull numbers don't make any sense.

40:22.754 --> 40:23.754
We sell boats.

40:23.796 --> 40:27.164
They're registered, re-registered,
sold and resold.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.547
And, by the way, the resale value
is through the fucking roof.

40:32.055 --> 40:34.798
Do you record the hull numbers
associated with each purchase?

40:34.891 --> 40:38.225
Now you know, and I know,
that it's illegal

40:38.311 --> 40:40.098
not to record those numbers, so...

40:40.772 --> 40:41.979
where are you going with this?

40:42.815 --> 40:44.351
Just doing our job, Mr. Aronoff.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.314
You know, catching bad guys.

40:47.403 --> 40:52.865
Okay, so do you go to Smith and Wesson
every time you haul someone in with a gun?

40:53.618 --> 40:55.575
Look, I make boats. Fast boats.

40:55.662 --> 40:59.827
People want them.
They come in here, I take their ID,

40:59.916 --> 41:03.409
they pay me money, and boom,
they are standing

41:03.503 --> 41:06.871
in the cockpit of a speedboat,
a very sexy speedboat.

41:07.507 --> 41:08.507
So what do you want me to do?

41:08.509 --> 41:10.625
To chase them down and fingerprint them?

41:10.718 --> 41:14.632
We'd put you on our payroll if you did.

41:15.765 --> 41:16.765
That's good.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.237
- Whoa, watch out.
- Out of the road!

41:44.752 --> 41:46.414
Make sure you get the name right.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.416
I'm Robbie fuckin' Reemer!

41:53.052 --> 41:54.839
<i>With the Feds closing in on him,</i>

41:55.471 --> 41:57.508
<i>Meyer Lansky fled to Israel,</i>

41:58.141 --> 42:00.929
<i>but Israel's welcome
to all Jews from anywhere</i>

42:01.019 --> 42:04.854
<i>did not include him,
and he was forced back to Miami.</i>

42:10.778 --> 42:12.940
Hey, Ben. Come.

42:21.622 --> 42:24.956
Meyer, welcome back. How are ya?

42:25.043 --> 42:26.329
Ben.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.706
They tell me that you made
all the payments back to me.

42:33.426 --> 42:36.089
Yes. Almost six months ago.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.965
We've just been rolling them out.

42:38.056 --> 42:41.675
You know, it's a...
Business booming and it's...

42:41.768 --> 42:44.932
Just... everyone and their brother
wants a speedboat.

42:45.897 --> 42:47.263
Here, let me get that.

42:51.611 --> 42:53.898
Yeah, it's good.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.780
You self-satisfied little prick.

43:06.709 --> 43:07.825
You took the money, Ben.

43:12.299 --> 43:13.834
You took the fuckin' money!

43:14.217 --> 43:16.630
You didn't borrow it
from Household Finance!

43:18.805 --> 43:20.965
You don't think that I got other things
to worry about?

43:21.265 --> 43:23.882
Besides Ben Aronoff
and his little fuckin' boat business?

43:23.976 --> 43:25.308
Meyer. Meyer, please.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.303
You know I'm grateful,

43:27.396 --> 43:30.139
and you also know
I went to great lengths to...

43:30.233 --> 43:31.314
Stop!

43:36.322 --> 43:38.530
We are growing our operations on the seas.

43:40.159 --> 43:42.492
You're clean and that helps.

43:42.995 --> 43:44.076
Don't play dumb.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.764
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

43:46.833 --> 43:48.995
Now, there is a big difference

43:49.085 --> 43:52.169
between what we had agreed upon
and what you're implying here.

43:52.672 --> 43:54.834
You'll do your fuckin' part!

44:04.475 --> 44:05.932
- Hey, champ.
- Hey.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.727
I got a fucking name!

44:11.232 --> 44:12.313
You remember me, right?

44:14.026 --> 44:16.439
Because Ben Aronoff has everything.

44:17.738 --> 44:18.738
Meyer's nephew.

44:19.866 --> 44:20.866
Meyer's nephew?

44:21.576 --> 44:22.576
You're not?

44:24.203 --> 44:26.286
I'm racing now! You better watch out!

44:26.372 --> 44:27.783
Oh, yeah? We'll be lookin' for ya.

44:58.029 --> 44:59.270
Good to see ya.

45:01.908 --> 45:02.944
I gotta see it.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.160
We're good?

45:15.421 --> 45:17.788
Yeah, we're good. It's this way.

45:25.681 --> 45:27.138
1.5 tons.

45:27.225 --> 45:28.932
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

45:29.018 --> 45:31.852
- Boys, get to work.
- Yes, sir.

45:39.987 --> 45:41.444
Whoo!

45:41.906 --> 45:45.274
It tastes stronger every day, man.

45:45.618 --> 45:48.201
Hey, boss! You want some?

45:48.287 --> 45:49.653
Yeah, pass it over here!

45:51.249 --> 45:52.865
Some fuckin' good weed!

45:52.959 --> 45:54.978
<i>See if you see him.
He's coming at you. Late-model C.</i>

45:55.002 --> 45:56.962
Yeah, we got eyes on him right now.

45:57.296 --> 46:01.165
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Everybody set?

46:01.259 --> 46:02.986
- Yes, sir. All set.
- All set. All set.

46:03.010 --> 46:04.717
Go! Go! Go!

46:06.764 --> 46:08.505
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit! Fuck!

46:09.308 --> 46:10.668
<i>This is the Coast Guard!</i>

46:10.726 --> 46:13.810
<i>Stop your boat! Stop your boat!</i>

46:31.497 --> 46:32.497
Oh, man!

46:33.499 --> 46:34.660
You okay? You okay?

46:35.042 --> 46:36.999
Shit! Brad looks bad!

46:37.086 --> 46:38.086
Grab the wheel!

46:41.716 --> 46:43.082
You're gonna be okay!

46:47.555 --> 46:48.591
Move!

46:51.851 --> 46:54.264
<i>Pick him up! Pick him up!</i>

47:10.202 --> 47:11.613
Need some repairs, champ.

47:12.246 --> 47:15.660
I got some holes in her,
and I want you to take care of it.

47:21.297 --> 47:22.297
Mmm.

47:23.257 --> 47:25.715
No. We don't do those kind of repairs.

47:26.010 --> 47:27.046
I'm sure you do.

47:27.887 --> 47:30.254
As a matter of fact, I know you do.

47:31.349 --> 47:33.869
And, while you're at it, how about you
put some of them custom seat-stitchings

47:33.893 --> 47:35.253
you've been doing on the new ones?

47:35.811 --> 47:37.143
I'd really like that.

47:37.897 --> 47:40.981
And, when you're done,
you can run the bill over to my uncle.

47:41.650 --> 47:42.857
Let me ask you something.

47:43.402 --> 47:45.359
- Hmm?
- Did your uncle teach you how to swim?

48:02.004 --> 48:03.745
Let's get a drink. Come on.

48:04.215 --> 48:05.609
This is so fun being with you, Ben.

48:05.633 --> 48:08.467
- Manhattan, two cherries?
- Let's do champagne.

48:08.552 --> 48:09.552
Champagne!

48:11.889 --> 48:13.300
Are they getting younger, champ,

48:13.391 --> 48:15.098
or are you just getting
more distinguished?

48:15.476 --> 48:17.934
Do you really want to start this
with your best-paying client?

48:18.020 --> 48:19.352
I'm not starting anything.

48:20.356 --> 48:23.315
- Uh, you are the famous boat racer?
- Yes.

48:23.401 --> 48:25.233
Yes.

48:25.319 --> 48:27.561
So shall I call you "The Animal?"

48:27.655 --> 48:28.771
Yes.

48:32.868 --> 48:34.234
You can call me "The Animal."

48:43.838 --> 48:45.955
- Your Majesty.
- King Hussein of Jordan?

48:46.465 --> 48:48.206
Now, you know this is the spot!

48:57.435 --> 49:00.849
<i>And, oh, my God, she walked in.</i>

49:17.288 --> 49:18.404
I've known him for years.

49:19.915 --> 49:20.951
I'll be right back.

49:27.131 --> 49:29.623
How's my favorite king?

49:30.926 --> 49:33.418
You didn't realize?
I stopped speaking to you

49:33.512 --> 49:35.970
after you sold those Donzis
to the Israelis,

49:36.056 --> 49:37.968
and they turned them into torpedo boats.

49:38.225 --> 49:40.808
Anything to beat the damn Arabs.

49:40.895 --> 49:42.136
Still the same Ben.

49:42.813 --> 49:43.894
My friends.

49:44.648 --> 49:47.857
You can't say "Miami"
without saying Ben Aronoff.

49:48.235 --> 49:51.319
And this lovely creature is Emily Gowen.

49:52.114 --> 49:53.114
My pleasure.

49:53.157 --> 49:56.946
I lure her from New York
to come slum with us on the beach.

49:57.495 --> 50:00.283
I wouldn't call it that, Your Highness.

50:02.708 --> 50:05.200
- Emily, how are you?
- Oh, you made it.

50:06.295 --> 50:07.536
So...

51:48.939 --> 51:51.727
Last night at The Jockey Club,
this motherfucker came up to me

51:51.817 --> 51:53.900
and said, "Get down
to your warehouse right now."

51:53.986 --> 51:56.353
So I dump my date, I speed down,

51:57.031 --> 51:59.444
I open up the fucking gates, and bam!

51:59.533 --> 52:02.025
There are two boats pulling up,
filled with marijuana.

52:02.119 --> 52:05.988
They take that shit through my warehouse,
put 'em on trucks,

52:06.540 --> 52:07.576
and this is what we get.

52:07.666 --> 52:09.248
This is how you go to jail, man.

52:11.086 --> 52:13.294
Ben, uh, what are we doin' here?

52:13.380 --> 52:15.588
This is Lansky saying, "Do your bit!"

52:16.091 --> 52:19.084
And, on top of that,
he wants me to fly down to the Caymans

52:19.178 --> 52:20.840
and make deposits on their money.

52:22.848 --> 52:24.214
That's not my biggest problem.

52:25.059 --> 52:26.641
You know anything about Emily Gowen?

52:26.727 --> 52:28.593
- You gotta be kidding me, right?
- No.

52:28.687 --> 52:30.790
Besides the fact
that she's King Hussein's girlfriend?

52:30.814 --> 52:33.022
Shelley, he's got two fuckin' wives.

52:33.108 --> 52:37.694
And bodyguards,
and an enormous bankroll, and an army.

52:38.113 --> 52:40.480
Please. Just get me the number, will ya?

52:53.170 --> 52:55.207
Hey! Hey, Emily!

52:56.465 --> 52:58.545
There's a guy up there,
says he wants to talk to you.

53:14.858 --> 53:16.065
I didn't know what to bring,

53:16.151 --> 53:19.144
but I saw that you drank this
the other night at the club.

53:19.571 --> 53:21.563
You're nothing if not persistent,
Ben Aronoff.

53:24.118 --> 53:25.154
I got your calls.

53:25.953 --> 53:28.161
Examine a man's faults,
you'll find his virtues.

53:36.296 --> 53:39.334
I have some stuff to do.
You're welcome to come along.

53:40.134 --> 53:41.170
Thank you.

53:42.261 --> 53:44.969
So, have you been riding
since you were a kid?

53:45.889 --> 53:47.676
- That's all I lived for.
- Hmm.

53:47.808 --> 53:49.970
Until my mother threw me into modeling.

53:52.354 --> 53:53.561
Have you ever been on a horse?

53:56.024 --> 53:58.311
I have a tough enough time
staying on a boat.

53:58.402 --> 54:01.270
No horses, but I do like horse races.

54:01.947 --> 54:03.563
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

54:04.908 --> 54:08.697
There's nothing like it when they're
really running and turning for home.

54:08.787 --> 54:10.949
It is the best 20 seconds on Earth.

54:11.039 --> 54:15.625
Yeah. The sound of those hooves
and the muscle and grit.

54:15.711 --> 54:18.795
It's amazing. It's truth.

54:19.423 --> 54:20.423
Yeah.

54:21.300 --> 54:24.418
Marlboro, he's my favorite,
so I always make time to feed him.

54:24.511 --> 54:28.972
If he had his way, he'd bust right
outta here and just keep running, right?

54:29.057 --> 54:31.265
I know how you feel, Marlboro.

54:31.351 --> 54:33.308
May I feed him? May I?

54:33.645 --> 54:35.056
Here, let me try.

54:37.608 --> 54:39.065
There you go. Oops.

54:39.526 --> 54:41.286
Let me try again. Here you go.

54:41.361 --> 54:44.479
Here. There you go. Wow.

54:48.285 --> 54:50.072
You're pretty comfortable around a horse.

54:51.163 --> 54:52.745
You sure you haven't been on one?

54:54.458 --> 54:57.872
- You're a natural.
- I wouldn't say that.

55:08.180 --> 55:09.546
It's gonna get worse.

55:10.766 --> 55:12.928
Hey, there's no shame
in sitting this one out.

55:13.018 --> 55:14.600
Half the field's already dropped.

55:14.895 --> 55:15.895
Really?

55:16.730 --> 55:19.814
You know, I knew a guy once,
looked a lot like you.

55:20.359 --> 55:22.817
He said,
"I'll never get tired of this shit!"

55:23.529 --> 55:24.690
- Come on.
- Yeah.

55:55.018 --> 55:56.018
Oh.

55:59.314 --> 56:03.058
I'm no sailor,
but those dark clouds can't be good.

56:04.862 --> 56:07.149
Do they have rain-outs
like they do in baseball?

56:08.574 --> 56:09.906
Let me explain, sweetheart.

56:09.992 --> 56:13.030
In the glorious sport
of offshore powerboat racing,

56:13.453 --> 56:15.740
you take the beating of a lifetime
for hours,

56:16.206 --> 56:19.370
there's no one there to cheer you on,
and if you get hurt,

56:19.459 --> 56:22.998
which Ben does every single race,
you can't quit.

56:23.088 --> 56:25.205
You gotta just keep going
until you see land.

56:26.383 --> 56:27.749
That's good to know, Mr. Katz,

56:27.843 --> 56:30.301
that the chances of Ben standing me up
on this date are...

56:30.637 --> 56:35.007
Zero to none. Okay?
And would ya please call me Shelley?

56:35.767 --> 56:38.384
Okay. Shelley.

56:51.450 --> 56:53.612
<i>I've got Ben Aronoff up front.</i>

56:53.702 --> 56:56.285
<i>Brassfield coming up in second.</i>

56:57.873 --> 56:59.330
<i>And there's Robbie Reemer</i>

56:59.416 --> 57:01.499
<i>fighting the waves and keeping it close.</i>

57:05.255 --> 57:08.373
<i>And there's Brassfield! He's making a run!</i>

57:08.884 --> 57:10.876
<i>Oh, he crashed! Brassfield crashed!</i>

57:12.721 --> 57:15.885
Circle back! Circle back!
We're gonna need a rescue!

57:37.371 --> 57:38.657
This is suicide!

57:40.248 --> 57:42.911
Come on.

57:43.293 --> 57:46.411
Come on! Oh, come on! Get over there!

57:52.844 --> 57:54.927
We're turning the fuck around!

58:01.103 --> 58:03.345
- We're the last one left!
- Keep going!

58:08.235 --> 58:13.731
- We can still turn!
- No! Full throttle! Full throttle!

58:14.866 --> 58:16.653
We can make it!

58:29.423 --> 58:30.459
Yeah?

58:34.302 --> 58:35.509
Yeah, okay.

58:36.805 --> 58:38.216
Well, keep me posted.

58:49.901 --> 58:52.484
All boats accounted for, except for Ben's.

58:55.782 --> 58:57.114
It's been over six hours.

58:58.285 --> 59:00.045
If he was gonna make it,
he'd be here by now.

59:04.082 --> 59:05.082
I hardly know him...

59:05.876 --> 59:08.334
Or... knew him.

59:12.716 --> 59:16.380
But he gets to you, your Ben.

59:49.252 --> 59:51.995
He made it! He made it!

59:54.257 --> 59:56.465
He made it! He made it!

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:51.562
Hey, Robbie!

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:55.141
I just heard Ben Aronoff
made it to Nassau, won the race.

01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:57.484
Thought you'd want to know.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.628

we'll cut off the flow of illegal drugs
into our country.

This way.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:14.890
We'll use the vault.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:32.241
Divide it evenly among these ten accounts.

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:37.492
No problem.
Pleasure to have your business.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:39.039
Looking forward to have much more.

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:42.747
Yes.

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:48.799
You're supposed to eat your food,
not wear it.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:51.530
You worked late,
and I didn't want to wake you.

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.554
It's okay.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:55.016
Morning.

01:04:55.018 --> 01:04:57.383
Morning. Bobo. Bo.

01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:01.186
I'll be home early.

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:11.443
<i>Our goal is to break
the power of the mob in America</i>

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:12.990

Ugh!

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:13.213
<i>Meyer Lansky
is the reputed crime boss</i>

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.090

<i>"We are bigger than U.S. steel,"

01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:22.928
<i>Lansky was buried in a Miami cemetery
in a plain coffin.</i>

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:28.419
I don't like it, Shelley.

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:30.810
I still have mud on my shoes
from Lansky's funeral.

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:34.193
That's 36 hours ago. Why?
Why this meeting?

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:35.551
Hey, it's just a courtesy, all right?

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.615
We're gonna sit down with them.
We're in, we're out.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.862
- Hey. Hey, Al.
- Shelley!

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:43.413
- Ben.
- Hey.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:46.376
Okay.

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:54.545
I want to keep this short.

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:59.597
Our company, Comanche, is building
a new plant on Thunderboat Alley.

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:03.642
Really? Have you bought the land yet?

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:05.264
That's why we're all here.

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:08.430
Well, good. So why don't you
just put a proposal together,

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:12.439
present it to Shelley, and I'll review it?

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.645
Simple.

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:15.229
Good. Let's go.

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:16.323
Sit down, Ben.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:21.076
This is bullshit, and you know it.

01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:24.580
Hey, hey, no, Ben. Ben, Ben.

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.032
- What?
- Let's come to peace.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.788
For you. That's it. What? What is it?

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:35.591
Here's the proposal.
Only it's not really a proposal.

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:38.301
You're gonna give us the land.

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:42.218
AI's gonna take care of the deed,

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.470
you and your lawyer pal here
are gonna sign it.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:48.479
And then we're gonna build our
own boat factory right down the street.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:51.018
We'll be neighbors.
Now, won't that be great?

01:07:51.693 --> 01:07:54.777
You're fucking crazy.
Come on! Jesus Christ!

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:57.070
We'll even throw
a big fuckin' block party, Ben!

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:58.317
- Good!
- You're invited!

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.611
Motherfuckers!

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.597
It's just dirt, Ben. What do you care?
You're not using it anyway.

01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:05.015
You know how much money they're making.

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:06.325
Why do they have to rip me off?

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.123
You're making a lot of money too, buddy.

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.431
And you're rich enough to not give a damn.

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:14.414
Besides, that kid is sloppy. All right?
He's all over the place.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:17.250
He'll be back in prison
before you know it, while you, my friend,

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.756
have a new company to run.
U.S.A. Racing, baby.

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.095
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:31.542
Safe flight, buddy.

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:33.979
I can't believe this, Shelley. Last run.

01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:36.151
I'm with you. Last run for me, too!

01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:39.564
Last time, Shelley!

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:11.728
Ha-ha! Big Ben!

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.145
Mister Vice President.

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:15.064
Oh, go tell it to the Marines.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.629
I'm happy with just plain old George.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:17.653
I'm happy with Ben.

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:20.444
- How are ya?
- How are you?

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.447
This is Nick Brady.
He's a long-time friend.

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:25.071
He runs a big bank in New York...
Dillon Read.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.197
Oh, well.

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:29.140
I've been hearing loads about you, too,
'cause George is always bragging.

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.747
- Is that right?
- You need someone to manage your millions.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.062
Nick runs a pretty good outfit.

01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:34.372
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Yeah.

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:35.919
- Is that it?
- That's it.

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:38.709
- Come.
- Holy smokes.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.152
Hey, what do you think of the jacket?

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:43.340
Uh, you look like a... like a boat racer.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:45.591
- Barbara thinks I look silly.
- How is Barbara?

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.002
Oh, she's doing great. Thank you.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:49.220
Well, it certainly passes the eye test.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:50.805
Mm-hmm.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:52.413
What are you gonna call this one?

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:53.645
Blue Thunder.

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:55.209
- Blue Thunder.
- Blue Thunder.

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:57.153
- Let's take her for a ride.
- Yeah, let's do it.

01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:40.893
And that's Gypsy Red winning
the Breeders Cup last spring.

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:42.853
I remember. My source.

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:45.272

That's right. We're getting there.

01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:55.958
The Tricycle Club in California,
legalized card gambling.

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:57.659
Bought for 30 million a year ago,

01:10:57.754 --> 01:10:59.495
and now worth five times that.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.536
What do they all have in common?

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:04.424
Bought with loans
by the same bank in Liechtenstein.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:05.510
Same forms, even.

01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:08.595
Liechtenstein. Jesus.
The secrecy laws there.

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:09.717
Hit the lights.

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:14.039
This is the Isle of Man,
just off the coast of England.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:16.596
The money to Liechtenstein
comes from here.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:20.190
And this man is singing like a canary.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.170
And has the bank records to back it up.

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:26.321
- Now, where's the trail start?
- It starts here.

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:32.323
But it's dope cash rolling in
every day by the wheelbarrow.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.537
Half a billion dollars last year alone.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:35.785
All cash.

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:37.366
Here's how we think it lays out.

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:40.661
From our investigation, a large network.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:44.499
Nice family. Who's the guy on top?

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.467
That right there, that's Robbie Reemer.

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:54.550
What is this?
"Let's snuff out the Cigarette."

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:58.179
George Bush.

01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:08.863
We just got us some government money!

Sincerely, William Van Raab,
Commissioner, U.S. Coast Guard.

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:17.949
Ten million dollars!
Couldn't get any richer!

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:20.705
Well, break out the fuckin' champagne!

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:23.879
- Come on, buddy!
- We did it!

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:25.172
- Yeah.
- U.S.A Rizzy, baby!

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:26.499
I gotta call. I gotta...

01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:29.130
Mmm.

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:36.933
I can't believe it.

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:40.896
- A fleet of my catamarans...
- Mmm-hmm.

01:12:40.982 --> 01:12:44.191
...protecting the coastal waters
of these United States.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:46.936
What'cha doin', bo-boo?

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:51.523
Oh, you don't have a chance.
This is the Coast Guard.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.358
We're driving the Blue Thunder.

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:57.822
I am so proud of you, Ben Aronoff.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:07.085
Not bad for the son of an immigrant,
from Sheepshead Bay, huh?

01:13:07.174 --> 01:13:10.292
Hmm, no. No, not bad at all.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:12.844
Now, you, you could've done better.

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:16.173
You could have had that King of Jordan.

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:17.474
You are my king.

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:20.186
Shelley!

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:22.475
Shelley!

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.068
Shelley!

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:34.868
Hey, Ben.

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.076
I need your help on something.

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:44.961
Right there.

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:03.353
I'm not gonna sign over
Blue Thunder to you.

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:05.021
You arrogant piece of shit.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.912
Do you think you're different than us?
Huh?

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:25.659
Something better?

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:27.289
Something special?

01:14:27.922 --> 01:14:29.959
You're just another guppy
in the food chain.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.837
Sign! Sign now!

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:48.766
You're property, Ben.
All you've ever been.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.737
Sign.

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:51.254
Morning!

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:53.873
Headed to the office.

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:58.596
You don't have to sleep in the guest room
when you get home late at night.

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:01.755
It makes me feel unwanted.

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:04.341
I didn't want to wake you. I love you.

01:16:15.529 --> 01:16:16.770
You know the Blue Thunder deal?

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:20.031
All that hoopla about catching
bad guys with better boats?

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:21.950
I just got off with customs,

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:24.389
and they've been asked
to make checks payable

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.451
to a new company, Super Chief South.

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:29.953
Robbie Reemer owns that company.

01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:34.232
So you're telling me the biggest
dope smuggler in the country

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:36.496
is in charge of building the boats
intended to catch him?

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:41.424
I thought the Blue Thunder contract
went out to Ben Aronoff.

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:43.095
Yeah, it did.

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:46.137
An old friend.

01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:12.334
Please. Sit.

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:30.010
No reason to coat this, Ben,

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.597
but our Dade County guys
tell us the Feds are digging around,

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:35.148
looking into everything.

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:37.851
Dope-running, money, the whole operation.

01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:40.423
A Grand Jury's collecting evidence
faster than we can clock it.

01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:43.281
It's bad.
And it's moving right up our asses.

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:49.238
So you're all personally suspects?

01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:51.914
Some fuckin' banker in Europe

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:54.835
is ratting us all the fuck out
for a fuckin' plea deal.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.621
So what do you want me to do?

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:04.966
How about some basic co-operation?

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:07.304
- Really?
- Really.

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:11.079
You know what?
You better bring your fuckin' goons here

01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:13.186
'cause I'll cut your fuckin' heart out.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:16.686
Get this asshole outta here,
or this meeting ends!

01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:20.689
I'm not kidding! Get him out! Get out!

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:23.772
Fuckin' handle this. Handle this!

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:36.167
Look, Ben...

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:40.417
we need to put some assets
back under your name,

01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:42.590
back under the purview of your companies.

01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:46.841
Remove it from the Feds' reach...
for a period.

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:53.927
You guys are precious.
You really, really are precious.

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:55.307
This is serious, Ben.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.397
Hmm.

01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:02.397
Fuck it. Move the assets.

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:06.151
But you put every single one
of them in my name,

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:07.608
not my company's name.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.618
And then good luck on getting them back.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:12.070
Nobody's winning here, Ben.

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:14.663
We're just talking about surviving.

01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:17.033
This is bigger than you,

01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:19.957
or Robbie, or fuckin' anyone.

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:24.086
Well, guess what? It ain't my problem.

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:44.353
What have you got us into?

01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:48.741
He has a gun.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:53.486
- Where's Willie?
- He's in his room.

01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:55.739
You go to him.

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:58.200
You go to him.

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:09.131
Nice place. Nice family.

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.221
I hate to see you lose it all.

01:20:14.852 --> 01:20:16.093
Now it's my family?

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:18.811
You're gonna get subpoenaed,

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:22.273
and all kinds of people
are worried about it.

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:25.102
Worried about what you're gonna say.

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:28.772
But I tell them...

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.443
I'm sure old Ben's gonna play ball.

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:33.652
He's on the team.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:36.863
That is what teammates do, right?

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:38.619
Get out.

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:41.204
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Good luck.

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:49.050
- You've been warned, Ben.
- Get the fuck out.

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:55.719
Tell me something. You owe me something.

01:20:56.393 --> 01:20:58.510
I have to get you out of here.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:01.392
I want you to get on the phone
and call your sister in New York

01:21:01.482 --> 01:21:03.442
and tell her that you're on the way.
Just do that.

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:04.525
What is going on?

01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:07.652
I will tell you everything
when you get to New York. I promise.

01:21:08.322 --> 01:21:10.109
I am scared.

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:13.943
I am scared for you.
I am scared for all of us.

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:16.028
Don't be. Don't be.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:22.997
- I love you.
- God. I love you, too.

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:25.204
Okay.

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:40.302
Now, listen. Listen. Listen to me.

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:41.728
We're gonna be fine.

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:45.478
I'll call your sister with the number
you can reach me. Okay?

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.229
I'll call you when I get in.

01:21:47.694 --> 01:21:49.856
Okay. Okay. Go, go. Go.

01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:07.169
Slow down. Slow down. Take it easy.

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:21.635
Don't alarm her.

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:24.388
Plenty of time
before we get to the causeway.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.026
Stay with her.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:19.359
Go, go, go, go. Don't let her go too far.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:14.005
- Emily.
<i>- Hey.</i>

01:24:14.091 --> 01:24:16.708
Oh, thank God. Hey, babe.

01:24:16.802 --> 01:24:18.964
<i>You're safe? No problems?</i>

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:24.971
Yeah. Yeah, William's already in bed,
and Aunt Cynthia's been incredible.

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:28.932
Except, I think I forgot
what winter was like.

01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:32.060
Yeah, man.
Oh, I used to hate Jersey winters.

01:24:33.527 --> 01:24:36.270
Well, it's pretty here. You should come.

01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:37.363
<i>I can't, babe.</i>

01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:39.939
You know, I can't put you guys at risk.

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:44.277
So are you gonna tell me?

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.156
Okay, look.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:52.539
Over the years, I did business
with a lot of shady guys, okay?

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:54.499
And I stepped on some toes.

01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:58.166
I don't know what that means.

01:24:58.635 --> 01:25:02.504
It means that I made promises
to people that I can no longer keep.

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:04.510
<i>And it's come back to haunt me.</i>

01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:07.557
The guy in the living room?

01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:11.763
The guy in the living room is just
one of a whole line of people

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:14.565
going all the way back
to my days in New Jersey.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:17.776
- The mob?
- Oh, fuck...

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:20.522
Okay, babe, listen.

01:25:23.535 --> 01:25:25.822
There is a big court case.

01:25:26.413 --> 01:25:28.154
A lot of people are gonna go down.

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:32.458
<i>And the Feds are pushing hard
on everyone, including me.</i>

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:34.378
So...

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:39.083
So, you and me, our lives,
it's just all been one big lie?

01:25:39.926 --> 01:25:41.212
Babe, don't say that.

01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:45.096
When I fuckin' saw you,
I dropped to my knees.

01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:46.514
You fuckin' stoned me.

01:25:47.768 --> 01:25:49.725
<i>You're the one who cleared up my life.</i>

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:53.684
Then run.

01:25:53.774 --> 01:25:55.481
I can't do that now, babe.

01:25:55.942 --> 01:25:57.183
<i>I'm a fighter too, Ben.</i>

01:25:57.277 --> 01:26:00.145
If you're in a fight,
I wanna be right at your side.

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:04.490
Just hang in there.

01:26:05.243 --> 01:26:06.700
<i>Hang in there for me, baby.</i>

01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:10.120
I love you.

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:31.936
Yeah?

01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:34.888
Hey.

01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:37.102
Uh-huh.

01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:39.479
Uh-huh.

01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:41.443
Where?

01:26:44.282 --> 01:26:45.614
What's the name?

01:26:58.463 --> 01:27:01.080
Okay, Dutch.
It's a straight shot down to 75.

01:27:01.466 --> 01:27:04.174
It's a little bend in Orlando,
but we don't change highways, so...

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:06.761
- Okay.
- Yeah. Take it easy.

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:14.178
- Hey. Come on.
- What? No tickets.

01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:17.605
- No tickets.
- No tickets.

01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:21.476
- No tickets!
- Yeah, no tickets.

01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:26.189
- That means the cops are...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember.

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:07.063
- Morning.
- Morning. Agent...?

01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:08.739
- Lopez.
- Ah!

01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:11.616
- It's been a while, hasn't it?
- Yes.

01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:15.788
A couple of goombahs wound up
in the E.R. last night.

01:28:15.916 --> 01:28:19.535
Smashed into by a Ford Bronco.
Thought you might know something about it.

01:28:24.007 --> 01:28:26.499
I... ran your plates.

01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:29.711
Put the word out, called around,
and bingo.

01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:32.630
It's kinda weird to find
a Mercedes in this parking lot.

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:36.472
Although, more likely to find
Robbie Reemer with a couple of hookers.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:40.889
- What do you want?
- I'm just curious.

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:45.185
You know, I really am,
'cause your name keeps popping up

01:28:45.278 --> 01:28:47.270
all over this big-ass investigation.

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:52.025
You know, a guy who was friends
with kings and queens,

01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:54.110
and a goddamn Vice-President,

01:28:54.204 --> 01:28:58.414
sells his multi-million-dollar government
contract to a mobbed up hustler?

01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:02.459
- It's just business.
- Just business?

01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:07.541
Look, you know, I read this book
once by a Jewish guy.

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:12.796
He said, "People who have a why to live
can bear almost anything."

01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:14.473
What's your why, Ben?

01:29:15.725 --> 01:29:17.136
Let me tell you something.

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:21.311
Sometimes it doesn't matter
who you are or what you have.

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:23.977
It's just too hard to say no.

01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:28.732
Do you have a plan?
'Cause you're in with a rough crowd.

01:29:29.155 --> 01:29:32.774
You can help us, and we can help you.

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:36.073
Water's calmed down,
we just gotta stay in the boat.

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:38.372
Hang on.

01:29:39.249 --> 01:29:40.410
That's a risky bet.

01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:42.999
I've been winning with it my whole life.

01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:47.455
Now, if you're not going to arrest me,
you have a nice day.

01:30:02.147 --> 01:30:04.355
Hey, buddy, there he is.

01:30:04.774 --> 01:30:07.482
Secret rendezvous on the beach.

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:09.898
Black.

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:14.941
I spoke to my buddy at the D.A.'s office.

01:30:15.035 --> 01:30:16.242
They won't confirm anything.

01:30:17.621 --> 01:30:19.640
On the other hand, they would
have told me to take a hike

01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:20.864
if the subpoena wasn't coming.

01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:24.284
If it's typed, it's ripe.

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:26.476
You're getting served, buddy-o, tomorrow.

01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:32.587
- That's actually great news.
- Really? How's that?

01:30:33.011 --> 01:30:35.219
Once you get served,
they'll keep you safe.

01:30:35.305 --> 01:30:38.844
The Reemers, whoever, they're not
gonna touch you once that happens.

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:41.972
They'll bring the Feds
and the Miami-Dade P.D.

01:30:42.562 --> 01:30:44.053
Dirty as they are, no one wants that.

01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:48.061
25 years
of your giving me high-end advice,

01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:52.942
and it all boils down to "Stick around
till you get served."

01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:54.112
That's the ticket.

01:30:54.199 --> 01:30:57.192
Here's something.
Now, you're involved in this, too.

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:06.042
All right, I'll tell you what.
Head back to your office,

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:08.168
grab your cash, anything you want,

01:31:08.588 --> 01:31:11.581
meet me at the Hollywood Marina,
we'll take my boat and just...

01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:15.460
just disappear for the day.
All right? We'll wait it out.

01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:20.469
Just two good ol' boys gone fishing.
Sounds good.

01:31:38.827 --> 01:31:42.696
Millie, it's me.
Anyone there I should know about?

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:44.872
<i>Nothing moving but the waves, Ben.</i>

01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:45.994
Good.

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:52.727
Can I help you?

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:56.102
I'm lookin', uh, for Ben Aronoff.

01:32:57.572 --> 01:32:58.653
I'm afraid he's not in.

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:00.148
Huh.

01:33:01.993 --> 01:33:05.111
I've been trying to reach him for a week,
but he hasn't gotten back to me.

01:33:05.705 --> 01:33:07.992
I call, and I call, and I call.

01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:14.875
Now, look, my boss
is a very wealthy man

01:33:14.964 --> 01:33:17.923
who wants to buy a boat.

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:21.127
And he wants to buy the boat
before he goes back to Michigan.

01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:23.429
Now, look, I'm just trying to give
this man some money.

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:24.926
I'm Ben.

01:33:26.726 --> 01:33:29.639
Why don't you bring your boss in,
we'll show him some boats,

01:33:29.729 --> 01:33:31.470
and he can see what he likes?

01:33:31.564 --> 01:33:32.564
My boss...

01:33:34.484 --> 01:33:35.645
took me from the gutter,

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:37.936
gave me a job.

01:33:39.489 --> 01:33:43.984
Everything I have, everything I am,
I owe to him.

01:33:44.536 --> 01:33:46.152
I'd do anything for my boss.

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:50.448
Anything... and everything.

01:33:52.001 --> 01:33:54.789
I'd never turn my back on my boss.

01:33:58.383 --> 01:34:01.126
You tell your boss that I'm done.

01:34:03.138 --> 01:34:05.551
I don't owe anybody anything.

01:34:06.516 --> 01:34:09.054
I'm paid in full and more so.

01:34:10.895 --> 01:34:12.932
- You tell him that.
- I'll tell him.

01:34:14.107 --> 01:34:15.473
I'll tell him every word.

01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:23.634
Hey, Ben.

01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:35.447
<i>I'm Ben Aronoff.
I was on top of the world.</i>

01:36:36.165 --> 01:36:39.624
<i>I loved, I created, I won.</i>

01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:42.328
<i>It was one hell of a race.</i>

01:36:43.256 --> 01:36:46.340
<i>Internationally known
race-boat designer, Don Aronow,</i>

01:36:46.426 --> 01:36:48.509
<i>was shot to death
this afternoon outside...</i>

01:36:48.594 --> 01:36:51.632
<i>...two-time world offshore
powerboat racing champion...</i>

01:36:51.723 --> 01:36:53.760
<i>...pronounced dead
at about 5:00...</i>

01:36:53.850 --> 01:36:55.160
<i>...the Godfather, that is him.</i>

01:36:55.184 --> 01:36:58.177
<i>You could call him the Henry Ford
of powerboats. He is the man...</i>

01:36:58.271 --> 01:37:01.890
<i>...starting up and developing
the sport of offshore powerboat racing...</i>

01:37:01.983 --> 01:37:03.127
<i>...raced his creations</i>

01:37:03.151 --> 01:37:05.393
<i>to three national
and two world championships.</i>

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:09.070
<i>His friends are badly shaken,
unable to understand why anyone would...</i>
