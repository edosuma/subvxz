- Nothing!

26:00.711 --> 26:04.360
I felt nothing.
A greater crime than the act itself.

26:04.465 --> 26:08.111
Then why spill blood
if not for the pleasure of it?

26:08.823 --> 26:11.444
Because men do not fear swords.

27:10.176 --> 27:14.201
For centuries, these moldering

27:14.305 --> 27:18.388
For I'm bound to this cave,
condemned by one who turned me.

27:18.956 --> 27:22.938
Oh, and I have waited an eternity
for a man of your strength,

27:23.127 --> 27:27.692
your gifts, your will.
A man worthy of the dark

27:27.796 --> 27:29.464
and all its powers.

27:31.197 --> 27:33.866
For if I am your salvation,

27:33.971 --> 27:35.403
you are mine.

Drink. You will have
a taste of my power.

The strength of 100 men.
The speed of a falling star.

and all its creatures.

27:55.951 --> 27:59.471

28:02.833 --> 28:06.190
- Even heal grievous wounds.
- At what price?

28:06.295 --> 28:07.901
Once you drink,

28:08.005 --> 28:11.729
your thirst for human blood
will be insatiable.

28:13.781 --> 28:17.035
But if you can resist for three days,

28:17.139 --> 28:20.934
you will return to your mortal state
having sampled my power,

28:21.039 --> 28:23.121
and perhaps, saved your people.

28:23.625 --> 28:24.876
And if I feed?

28:24.980 --> 28:28.418
The price would be worse than
if you'd never stepped in here.

28:29.568 --> 28:34.635
For I will be set free having granted
the darkness a worthy offering.

28:35.115 --> 28:37.764
You will become its vessel as I am.

28:37.868 --> 28:42.769

destroy everything you hold dear.

be free to unleash my wrath

28:55.006 --> 28:57.033
against the one who betrayed me.

28:57.137 --> 29:01.191
And one day, I will call on
you to serve me, my pawn,

29:01.663 --> 29:05.646
- in an immortal game of revenge.
- This is not a game!

29:05.750 --> 29:08.836

to endure eternity?

29:08.941 --> 29:13.043

is the ultimate game.
