WEBVTT

00:11.100 --> 00:12.634
We have brought upon us

00:12.636 --> 00:17.405
our own destruction, my beloved.

00:17.407 --> 00:20.341
It was without form and void.

00:20.343 --> 00:24.112
Unto the heavens and
they had no light.

00:24.114 --> 00:28.583
I looked and behold,
there was no man.

00:28.585 --> 00:32.787
I looked and behold, the
fruitful land was a desert.

00:32.789 --> 00:37.158
And its cities were laid
in ruins before the lord.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.495
Before his fierce anger
for thus, said the lord,

00:40.497 --> 00:43.665
"the whole land
shall be desolation."

00:45.100 --> 00:50.605
Jeremiah, chapter 4:23-27.

00:50.607 --> 00:53.675
It is said by the unwise,

00:53.677 --> 00:57.578
by the unbelievers
that death comes to us

00:57.580 --> 01:00.982
in the visage of a reaper

01:00.984 --> 01:04.319
harvesting his crops
with a great scythe.

01:04.321 --> 01:07.789
But we've been
taught differently.

01:07.791 --> 01:10.491
For the trumpet will sound

01:10.493 --> 01:13.928
and the dead will be
raised imperishable.

01:13.930 --> 01:18.533
And this mortal body
must put on immortality.

01:18.535 --> 01:19.667
Behold.

01:19.669 --> 01:20.735
Hey there.

01:21.804 --> 01:26.741
Just this stuff and...

01:26.743 --> 01:29.811
Let's make it...

01:29.813 --> 01:32.680
$12.92 in gas.

01:32.682 --> 01:37.418
<i>By an epidemic,
an epidemic of sin.</i>

01:37.420 --> 01:42.590
<i>We have brought upon us our
own destruction, my beloved.</i>

01:42.592 --> 01:46.627
<i>I am the resurrection
and the life,</i>

01:46.629 --> 01:49.664
<i>whoever believes in me</i>

01:49.666 --> 01:51.632
<i>though he die yet</i>

01:51.634 --> 01:54.302
<i>shall he live.</i>

01:54.304 --> 01:56.637
I love him.

01:56.639 --> 02:00.108
How can you love
somebody you've never met?

02:01.744 --> 02:03.811
Don't over-pump.

02:03.813 --> 02:05.780
You have a nice day too.

02:05.782 --> 02:09.817
And honey, be careful,
there are crazies out there.

02:33.308 --> 02:34.308
Hey!

02:35.244 --> 02:36.344
Hey!

02:36.346 --> 02:37.845
Hey you, please!

02:38.614 --> 02:39.680
Please you have to help me!

02:39.682 --> 02:41.349
You have to help me,
no, no, no, come on.

02:41.351 --> 02:42.884
Okay, okay, okay.

02:50.026 --> 02:51.626
Can you please help him?

02:51.628 --> 02:53.628
He's not contagious is he?

02:53.630 --> 02:55.830
Hey hey hey hey hey hey.

02:55.832 --> 02:58.266
Okay wait, your name
is Richard Hanna.

02:58.268 --> 03:02.503
We've been married 10 years,
come on, remember?

03:02.505 --> 03:04.872
Stay with me, stay with me.

03:05.574 --> 03:07.275
What's your name, sweetie?

03:07.277 --> 03:10.611
Um, Dee, I'm Dee.

03:10.613 --> 03:12.613
He's dying, isn't he?

03:12.615 --> 03:14.649
I don't know, Dee,
maybe we should take him

03:14.651 --> 03:15.917
to the hospital.

03:15.919 --> 03:20.188
No, emergency room was
overflowing, people everywhere.

03:20.190 --> 03:21.756
He wanted to try somewhere else

03:21.758 --> 03:25.126
and um, I shouldn't
have listened to him.

03:25.128 --> 03:27.829
I think running made it worse.

03:28.964 --> 03:31.365
Mommy, what's a Sisyphus?

03:34.803 --> 03:37.105
Dee, let me call
an ambulance, okay?

03:37.107 --> 03:40.575
I'm sorry, I don't
know what else to do.

04:06.135 --> 04:09.971
That was a nice thing
you did for that lady.

04:09.973 --> 04:12.039
Your detritus.

04:54.349 --> 04:55.149
Hi.

04:55.151 --> 04:56.484
Hey Kirbs.

04:56.486 --> 04:57.685
What's up?

04:57.687 --> 04:59.487
Just checkin' in with you.

04:59.489 --> 05:02.456
Hey did you know the family from <i> the
hills have eyes</i> opened a gas station?

05:02.458 --> 05:03.658
On your way?

05:03.660 --> 05:05.293
You betcha.

05:05.295 --> 05:06.861
Maybe sometime
you'll let me come

05:06.863 --> 05:08.529
to your place.

05:08.531 --> 05:10.598
Let's uh, not have
this conversation

05:10.600 --> 05:11.799
for the millionth time.

05:11.801 --> 05:13.801
I could meet your friends.

05:13.803 --> 05:15.169
They're all jerks.

05:15.171 --> 05:17.438
Could cook you my pizza rolls.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.674
Real pizza, my treat.

05:19.676 --> 05:22.009
You don't sleep well in my bed.

05:22.011 --> 05:25.112
I'm not going there to sleep.

05:25.114 --> 05:27.114
You just winked
to the phone, didn't you?

05:27.116 --> 05:28.783
Maybe.

05:28.785 --> 05:32.186
Fine, you just got me wondering

05:32.188 --> 05:33.788
if you've got heads
in your freezer.

05:33.790 --> 05:34.790
Uh huh.

05:39.995 --> 05:42.196
Wait, I'm coming
up on another one.

05:43.466 --> 05:45.199
There's an outback.

05:45.201 --> 05:47.201
A rendezvous
just rolled past my place.

05:47.203 --> 05:49.270
Oh my god.

05:49.272 --> 05:51.739
Oh wait, here's another one.

05:52.574 --> 05:55.810
It's a breeze.

05:57.145 --> 05:58.746
Hello?

05:58.748 --> 05:59.748
Hello?

06:00.616 --> 06:01.716
Damn it.

06:14.696 --> 06:15.830
Shit.

06:27.777 --> 06:29.010
God damn-it.

06:52.868 --> 06:55.803
License and registration.

06:55.805 --> 06:57.605
No bullshit please.

07:03.245 --> 07:06.247
Having ourselves a
little road trip are we?

07:06.249 --> 07:10.518
Skills like that you'll
make detective in no time.

07:13.255 --> 07:16.090
Hey, I have the
same phone as you.

07:33.408 --> 07:34.408
Miss Lane.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.677
Don't sneak up on me like that!

07:36.679 --> 07:39.680
Do you know why I
pulled you over today?

07:39.682 --> 07:42.583
To protect everybody
else on the road?

07:42.585 --> 07:45.019
Everyone's a comedian, huh?

07:45.021 --> 07:46.687
I wrote you up for speeding

07:46.689 --> 07:47.822
and dangerous operation.

07:47.824 --> 07:49.590
That's a $500 fine.

07:49.592 --> 07:51.859
But there's nobody else
to endanger, come on!

07:51.861 --> 07:53.861
Listen, I'm too tired
to argue with you,

07:53.863 --> 07:55.730
so um, how 'bout this?

07:57.666 --> 07:59.934
I will agree to tear
up your citation

07:59.936 --> 08:03.337
if you agree to take
a nap for 60 minutes

08:03.339 --> 08:06.107
and decide to drive slow
for the rest of your trip.

08:06.109 --> 08:07.108
Really?

08:07.110 --> 08:10.611
60 minutes, I want your word.

08:10.613 --> 08:11.613
Sold.

08:15.650 --> 08:18.786
I'll radio in that I let
you off with a warning.

08:18.788 --> 08:20.821
You drive safely now.

09:04.666 --> 09:08.002
Please, please,
please, please, please.

09:18.580 --> 09:20.114
Thank you for calling Northstar,

09:20.116 --> 09:22.316
this is Max, am I
speaking to Kirby Lane?

09:22.318 --> 09:22.316
Yes.

09:22.318 --> 09:24.685
How can I help
you tonight, miss Lane?

09:24.687 --> 09:26.987
This piece of shit car won't go.

09:26.989 --> 09:30.658
Okay, miss Lane,
I understand this is a

09:30.660 --> 09:32.026
taxing situation.

09:32.028 --> 09:35.129
I go out and I get all this
turbo this, road side that,

09:35.131 --> 09:38.098
and then when I need the car,
it craps on itself and dies.

09:38.100 --> 09:40.801
Now miss Lane,
I'm sure it's not dead.

09:40.803 --> 09:43.971
It has big Xs where the
headlights used to be.

09:43.973 --> 09:47.408
Okay, well, let's
see what we have here.

09:47.410 --> 09:50.277
Okay, have you been doing
routine maintenance?

09:50.279 --> 09:52.913
Tire pressure, changing the oil?

09:55.183 --> 09:56.317
Yes?

09:56.319 --> 09:58.752
Uh huh, I see.

09:58.754 --> 10:01.789
Are you hurt or in any danger?

10:01.791 --> 10:04.792
I think I heard some
wolverines earlier.

10:04.794 --> 10:07.027
Well, according
to our records, miss Lane,

10:07.029 --> 10:10.431
that SUV of yours is the
next best thing to a tank.

10:10.433 --> 10:11.699
You should be fine.

10:11.701 --> 10:16.871
But uh, looks like your
transmission's fried.

10:16.873 --> 10:18.606
I'm stuck in neutral.

10:18.608 --> 10:20.608
All right, I'll put
a call in for a tow truck,

10:20.610 --> 10:24.512
but based on your location,
it's gonna be a few hours.

10:24.514 --> 10:25.613
Hours?

10:25.615 --> 10:27.681
Maybe I should just walk.

10:27.683 --> 10:29.783
Don't be a hero, miss Lane.

10:29.785 --> 10:33.587
Just sit tight, okay,
help is on the way.

10:33.589 --> 10:34.855
Thanks tons.

10:34.857 --> 10:36.123
I'll check in
on you later, miss Lane.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.958
Thank you for using Northstar.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.026
Thank you,

10:40.595 --> 10:41.829
Mr. personality.

10:50.639 --> 10:52.206
Call voice mail.

10:52.208 --> 10:54.475
Calling voice mail.

11:04.619 --> 11:07.021
You have no messages.

11:18.867 --> 11:21.936
Jesus!

11:25.106 --> 11:26.106
Dammit.

11:32.514 --> 11:33.514
Shit!

11:42.090 --> 11:43.624
Where the fuck are you?

11:43.626 --> 11:46.860
Car broke down and the
stupid tow truck is taking

11:46.862 --> 11:48.796
the scenic route.

11:48.798 --> 11:50.764
You wanna go to video?

11:50.766 --> 11:52.666
You bet I do.

11:56.338 --> 11:58.639
You look a little wobbly.

11:58.641 --> 12:03.043
Well I am feeling
a little frisky.

12:04.312 --> 12:06.347
I've had a long day, sweetie,

12:06.349 --> 12:09.016
and my phone's about to die,
so...

12:10.652 --> 12:14.588
Sounds like somebody
needs to unwind a bit.

12:14.590 --> 12:17.625
I can help you
with that you know.

12:17.627 --> 12:22.196
I specialize in
getting you to unwind.

12:24.466 --> 12:25.599
Besides, what else
are you gonna do

12:25.601 --> 12:28.035
'til the tow truck gets there?

13:07.642 --> 13:10.477
I cannot wait to be with you.

13:46.781 --> 13:48.282
Thank you for calling north...

13:48.284 --> 13:50.117
where the fuck is my tow truck?

13:50.119 --> 13:51.819
I've been waiting for hours.

13:51.821 --> 13:53.987
Miss Lane?

13:53.989 --> 13:57.424
Great, world champion
of customer service.

13:57.426 --> 13:58.992
Lemme talk to someone else.

13:58.994 --> 14:00.661
I'm the only one here.

14:00.663 --> 14:01.962
Yeah, you mean you're
the only one there willing

14:01.964 --> 14:03.197
to talk to me.

14:03.199 --> 14:05.999
No, I mean
I'm the only one here.

14:06.001 --> 14:08.602
Where's that damn tow, Max?

14:12.609 --> 14:13.508
Well?

14:13.509 --> 14:15.843
I don't know
what's going on, miss Lane,

14:15.845 --> 14:18.145
I put the order in last
night for a dispatcher and,

14:18.147 --> 14:19.513
look, I just sent another one.

14:19.515 --> 14:20.814
But I'm getting no response.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.416
Well, what am I supposed to do,

14:22.418 --> 14:24.585
hitch a ride on a camel?

14:24.587 --> 14:27.855
Can you flag down another car?

14:32.026 --> 14:35.295
I think I took the exit
to the "twilight zone."

14:35.297 --> 14:38.532
Miss Lane,
I've got some bad news.

14:38.534 --> 14:39.534
For a change?

14:41.336 --> 14:43.804
I'm gonna have to
call you back in a second.

14:43.806 --> 14:44.605
Sit tight, okay?

14:44.607 --> 14:45.706
Fine.

14:59.654 --> 15:02.689
I have no idea what I'm doing.

15:02.691 --> 15:03.824
Hello?

15:09.664 --> 15:11.932
Jesus, mister, are you sick?

15:16.137 --> 15:17.638
Whoa man, don't come any closer!

15:17.640 --> 15:21.909
Back off or else I'm gonna
brain you with this thing.

15:23.411 --> 15:25.913
Jesus Christ!

15:27.115 --> 15:28.448
I'm sorry!

15:28.450 --> 15:31.518
Um, oh Jesus are you dead?

15:32.654 --> 15:35.455
Listen, I'm sorry,
you wouldn't listen to me

15:35.457 --> 15:37.090
and I...
God, I'm so sorry.

15:41.430 --> 15:42.763
Jesus! Fuck!

15:47.335 --> 15:50.871
Max, a tow truck would be
past wonderful right now.

15:50.873 --> 15:52.139
Why, what's happened?

15:52.141 --> 15:54.441
There's a man,
there's a crazy man.

15:54.443 --> 15:57.444
Okay Kirby, stay
calm, keep the doors locked

15:57.446 --> 15:58.245
and the windows up, okay?

15:58.247 --> 16:00.247
Christ, there's another one!

16:00.249 --> 16:02.583
Jesus, they're coming
out of everywhere.

16:02.585 --> 16:04.451
Look, I know this is
gonna sound stupid right now,

16:04.453 --> 16:05.686
but you need to stay calm.

16:05.688 --> 16:06.987
Calm? Max...

16:06.989 --> 16:08.522
I just buried my
wrench through the forehead

16:08.524 --> 16:10.791
of this man, and he's
still banging on my window.

16:10.793 --> 16:12.092
I know.

16:12.094 --> 16:13.794
You know?
How do you know?

16:13.796 --> 16:15.662
Well, we've been getting
reports like this all day.

16:15.664 --> 16:17.164
Something sort of
crazy is happening.

16:17.166 --> 16:18.599
You can say that again.

16:18.601 --> 16:20.000
Some kind of outbreak.

16:20.002 --> 16:22.803
It's making people crazy.

16:22.805 --> 16:23.804
Just stay in the car,
Kirby, all right?

16:23.806 --> 16:25.606
Help is on the way.

16:57.038 --> 16:58.605
Kirby?

16:58.607 --> 16:59.539
What?

16:59.541 --> 17:01.508
What happened?

17:01.510 --> 17:05.579
I just got rescued by
the cast of <i> deliverance.</i>

17:16.758 --> 17:18.492
One of them's coming
this way, I gotta go.

17:18.493 --> 17:20.160
Wait, Kirby.

17:22.997 --> 17:23.997
You bit?

17:25.666 --> 17:26.666
What?

17:27.769 --> 17:29.870
You look clean enough.

17:29.872 --> 17:32.372
What are you doing out here?

17:33.775 --> 17:36.109
Waiting for my tow truck.

17:37.011 --> 17:38.078
Tow truck?

17:39.614 --> 17:40.881
Call me the captain
of the obvious,

17:40.883 --> 17:43.350
but I don't think it's coming.

17:46.287 --> 17:49.222
Fucking head exploded man.

17:52.694 --> 17:56.129
Dirty, dirty
fucking shit out there.

17:56.131 --> 17:58.999
So how many kills you get today?

18:00.668 --> 18:01.902
Lost count.

18:04.939 --> 18:06.173
Whatever it was,
it was a damn sight

18:06.175 --> 18:09.076
more than miss pinky over here.

18:09.078 --> 18:10.078
Bullshit.

18:11.579 --> 18:12.546
Bullshit?

18:12.548 --> 18:14.648
I'm not not talking about
winging some fuckers,

18:14.650 --> 18:17.184
I'm talking about kill shots.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.421
Kill shots, huh?

18:21.423 --> 18:24.858
Why don't you go see
if our girl's hungry?

18:26.694 --> 18:28.495
Don't mind if I do.

18:39.507 --> 18:40.507
Hungry?

18:48.316 --> 18:51.351
Look who's decided
to join the party.

18:51.353 --> 18:54.154
Park your little butt fireside.

18:55.423 --> 18:57.190
What's on the menu?

18:58.659 --> 18:59.659
Barbecue.

19:07.502 --> 19:09.469
It's something.

19:09.471 --> 19:10.670
Try it out, baby.

19:17.745 --> 19:19.413
It's kinda flat.

19:24.420 --> 19:27.487
Oh, she's a pretty one,
isn't she?

19:38.200 --> 19:39.200
That's it.

19:43.004 --> 19:44.171
Then nothing.

20:03.858 --> 20:05.125
That's disgusting.

20:05.127 --> 20:07.527
Hey, don't knock
it till you've tried.

20:07.529 --> 20:09.162
You actually eat them?

20:09.164 --> 20:13.433
Well, hell, everything's
got its uses, even them.

20:14.502 --> 20:16.036
You sure you don't want none?

20:16.038 --> 20:18.872
Thanks, I had ears for lunch.

20:24.645 --> 20:26.613
Intestinal lining?

20:26.615 --> 20:28.748
It's chicken noodle soup.

20:34.989 --> 20:37.457
Aren't you afraid
that you're gonna like...

20:37.459 --> 20:38.258
what?

20:38.260 --> 20:39.260
Turn?

20:42.497 --> 20:45.632
Been watching too much TV, girl.

20:45.634 --> 20:49.636
Only way you can turn
is by getting bit.

20:49.638 --> 20:52.672
And that's why we all got
a pact with each other.

20:52.674 --> 20:54.474
What kinda pact?

20:54.476 --> 20:55.675
Death pact.

20:57.745 --> 21:02.616
Any one of us gets bit, falls
to the others do the job

21:02.618 --> 21:05.685
before we become like them.

21:05.687 --> 21:09.456
Mm, aw, that's the stuff.

21:09.458 --> 21:11.224
I'll take your word for it.

21:14.762 --> 21:16.496
So where'd they come from?

21:16.498 --> 21:20.634
Ya know, like why, why
are they like that?

21:20.636 --> 21:21.735
I dunno.

21:22.970 --> 21:27.007
Just woke up one day and the
whole world went to hell.

21:31.646 --> 21:33.213
Where you headed?

21:34.415 --> 21:35.916
City.

21:38.587 --> 21:40.020
Talk about hell.

21:41.122 --> 21:42.122
Why?

21:43.124 --> 21:46.092
Shit, that whole place is
crawling with creepers.

21:46.094 --> 21:48.161
There's gotta be
some help though.

21:48.163 --> 21:49.262
What about the government?

21:52.333 --> 21:53.900
Shit, government.

21:54.769 --> 21:56.670
You trust them?

21:56.672 --> 21:58.672
Gotta trust something?

21:58.674 --> 22:00.273
How the hell do you
know they're not the ones

22:00.275 --> 22:02.342
that caused this
in the first place?

22:02.344 --> 22:04.744
I'd say it was
those damn liberals.

22:04.746 --> 22:07.347
You think everything
was liberals.

22:07.349 --> 22:09.583
Yeah, that's 'cause
almost everything is.

22:09.585 --> 22:12.686
With their doctors and
their scientists trying

22:12.688 --> 22:16.590
to play god, well,
you reap what you sow.

22:16.592 --> 22:18.358
Here we go.

22:18.360 --> 22:20.594
Be not deceived,
god is not mocked,

22:20.596 --> 22:23.330
for whatsoever a man
reapeth he shall also sow.

22:23.332 --> 22:24.798
Galatians 6:7.

22:24.800 --> 22:25.800
Okay.

22:26.801 --> 22:28.568
That's all this is.

22:30.104 --> 22:33.640
God's little way of reminding
us he's still in charge.

22:33.642 --> 22:35.408
Yeah, well, I don't
think god has anything

22:35.410 --> 22:36.776
to do with this.

22:36.778 --> 22:38.511
No?

22:38.513 --> 22:40.180
Probably a democrat too.

22:40.182 --> 22:43.783
I'm not discussing
that with you, okay.

22:43.785 --> 22:46.119
I knew it, goddamned
liberal here in our midst.

22:46.121 --> 22:49.789
All right, enough
already, ravage.

22:49.791 --> 22:52.092
Blondie here's our guest.

22:52.094 --> 22:54.761
I don't know, never
did much trust a woman

22:54.763 --> 22:57.597
who's afraid to
eat a little meat.

23:10.946 --> 23:12.579
He ain't coming.

23:12.581 --> 23:13.680
What?

23:13.682 --> 23:15.448
You still waiting
on that tow truck,

23:15.450 --> 23:19.719
but uh, I think he's got
problems plenty of his own.

23:21.789 --> 23:23.590
Drink?

23:23.592 --> 23:24.658
No thanks.

23:26.127 --> 23:27.394
More for me.

23:32.767 --> 23:33.867
So,

23:35.870 --> 23:38.004
you know, we should just
go ahead and get started.

23:38.006 --> 23:39.673
Get started?

23:39.675 --> 23:41.941
God, I don't think so, man.

23:41.943 --> 23:44.644
Oh, that's no way to be.

23:44.646 --> 23:46.980
After all, I did save your life.

23:46.982 --> 23:48.548
I'm outta here.

23:51.119 --> 23:52.585
Fucking bitch.

23:54.322 --> 23:56.256
I warned you.

23:56.258 --> 23:58.758
Got me a feisty one here.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.860
Hey, game on, smokes?

24:03.764 --> 24:04.831
Stay back.

24:07.601 --> 24:11.638
You're looking at
this all wrong, Blondie.

24:11.640 --> 24:15.742
I mean, this is not like
something that I wanna do.

24:15.744 --> 24:17.243
But we gotta breed.

24:18.846 --> 24:23.083
The very survival of the
human race is depending on it.

24:23.085 --> 24:24.484
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:24.486 --> 24:25.685
Wow.

24:25.687 --> 24:29.789
I've heard some lines
in my life but... wow!

24:29.791 --> 24:30.990
Just grab her ass.

24:32.627 --> 24:34.527
I call seconds.

24:34.529 --> 24:35.529
No!

24:37.331 --> 24:38.765
Stop!

24:38.767 --> 24:39.866
Get off!

24:44.439 --> 24:46.172
Drop the gun.

24:46.174 --> 24:47.674
Nobody move.

24:47.676 --> 24:50.276
She shot my dick off!

24:50.278 --> 24:51.578
Keys.

24:52.681 --> 24:53.913
Don't fuck with me.

24:58.086 --> 24:59.119
Outta bullets, huh?

25:23.611 --> 25:24.611
No!

25:52.640 --> 25:54.941
Are you still drinking water?

25:54.943 --> 25:56.709
I'm alone out here.

25:58.145 --> 26:01.281
I'm with you, don't
worry, I'm not going anywhere.

26:01.283 --> 26:03.783
No, you jerk, the sick people.

26:03.785 --> 26:06.453
They were here before
and now they're not.

26:06.455 --> 26:10.590
Maybe they're planning
a surprise party for you.

26:10.592 --> 26:14.027
Listen, I'm gonna walk.

26:14.029 --> 26:15.261
What?

26:15.263 --> 26:16.529
To Vincent.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.865
He's in the city and
I'm worried about him.

26:18.867 --> 26:20.533
Stay put.

26:20.535 --> 26:23.002
Can't live forever
on popcorn and Pepsi.

26:23.004 --> 26:25.705
Someone will come for you.

26:25.707 --> 26:27.974
If I can't drive myself,
I'm walking.

26:27.976 --> 26:30.643
If you walk away, it's suicide.

26:30.645 --> 26:33.580
It's like 50 miles to
the next rest area.

26:33.582 --> 26:35.181
There's not much choice.

26:35.183 --> 26:36.683
What if they come back?

26:36.685 --> 26:38.785
If you walk all that
way before nightfall,

26:38.787 --> 26:40.353
what if it's not safe?

26:40.355 --> 26:43.957
I'm not just gonna sit
here and wait to die, okay?

26:43.959 --> 26:46.626
I'm alone out here, the
tow truck is not coming,

26:46.628 --> 26:50.497
and my car's dead so,
Vincent will wait for me.

26:51.599 --> 26:53.666
It's 'cause of me he's
still in the city.

26:58.105 --> 27:01.107
Look, monitor
the radio, get online,

27:01.109 --> 27:06.246
I'm sure there's shelter.

27:06.248 --> 27:07.413
Are you okay?

27:08.782 --> 27:10.450
I just killed somebody.

27:10.452 --> 27:13.920
Do you have a first aid kit?

27:22.930 --> 27:25.398
Those assholes are sneaky.

27:26.934 --> 27:28.701
I need a life boat.

27:31.438 --> 27:32.772
Hey Max.

27:32.774 --> 27:33.773
Yeah?

27:33.775 --> 27:35.842
Looks like you're
coming with me.

27:55.629 --> 27:56.629
Let's go.

28:12.746 --> 28:15.381
Wishing I got a Prius about now.

28:30.265 --> 28:31.664
Hello?

28:31.666 --> 28:34.167
Kirby, I'm really glad...

28:34.169 --> 28:36.235
Vincent, are you there?

28:39.207 --> 28:42.976
Hey, hey, you're breaking up
and my phone's almost dead.

28:42.978 --> 28:44.644
Hello?

28:44.646 --> 28:45.646
Hello?

28:47.414 --> 28:48.648
Damn it!

29:08.435 --> 29:09.435
Break time.

29:17.645 --> 29:18.978
You there, Max?

29:18.980 --> 29:20.613
Go ahead, Kirby.

29:20.615 --> 29:22.015
I'm running out of water.

29:22.017 --> 29:23.616
I know it's hard,
but you need to make sure

29:23.618 --> 29:25.818
you take small
sips twice an hour.

29:25.820 --> 29:28.087
If you can ration yourself,
you can go a lot longer.

29:28.089 --> 29:30.690
Did you read that in
a manual or something?

29:30.692 --> 29:31.858
It's just what they told us

29:31.860 --> 29:33.960
to say in training class.

29:33.962 --> 29:35.995
Right, I think we're
going to have to go way

29:35.997 --> 29:37.997
off book for this one.

29:37.999 --> 29:39.432
Yeah.

29:39.434 --> 29:41.267
Where's your accent from anyway?

29:41.269 --> 29:42.769
Essex originally.

29:42.771 --> 29:44.771
You sound like James Bond.

29:44.773 --> 29:46.339
Or K.I.T.T.
From "knight rider."

29:46.341 --> 29:47.640
I hear that one a lot.

29:47.642 --> 29:49.442
What's it like where you are?

29:49.444 --> 29:50.777
Bad.

29:50.779 --> 29:53.079
It's worse than yesterday.

29:53.081 --> 29:54.947
More of them seem to
be coming every hour.

29:54.949 --> 29:56.582
You safe?

29:56.584 --> 29:58.818
We have a barricade
up, it seems to be holding

29:58.820 --> 30:00.186
for the moment.

30:01.689 --> 30:03.690
So now what?

30:03.692 --> 30:05.291
What?

30:05.293 --> 30:07.427
How 'bout a game,
help pass the time?

30:07.429 --> 30:09.696
Um, I'm not good with games.

30:09.698 --> 30:11.130
Come on.

30:11.132 --> 30:12.465
I don't know.

30:12.467 --> 30:14.133
How 'bout guess that movie.

30:14.135 --> 30:16.302
Never heard of that one.

30:16.304 --> 30:18.938
It's a game where I give
you a famous movie quote

30:18.940 --> 30:21.007
and you guess the movie.

30:21.009 --> 30:22.642
Okay, you go first.

30:22.644 --> 30:24.610
Okay, here's an easy one.

30:24.612 --> 30:26.946
"Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

30:26.948 --> 30:28.781
"Open the pod bay doors."

30:28.783 --> 30:30.616
<i>A space odyssey.</i>

30:30.618 --> 30:32.785
See? And you said you
weren't good at this.

30:32.787 --> 30:33.586
It was a lucky break.

30:33.588 --> 30:34.654
Your turn.

30:36.490 --> 30:38.958
Hold on, let me think.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.159
Hurry.

30:40.161 --> 30:41.761
Okay, I've got one.

30:41.763 --> 30:44.097
"From hell's heart
I stab at thee."

30:44.099 --> 30:46.699
Easy,<i> Star Trek ii: Wrath of Khan.</i>

30:46.701 --> 30:48.468
That's correct.

30:48.470 --> 30:50.002
I would have also
accepted <i> Moby dick.</i>

30:50.004 --> 30:50.970
That's a book.

30:50.972 --> 30:53.172
It's a movie, too.

30:54.775 --> 30:57.677
So what did you do
for a living before?

30:57.679 --> 30:59.746
I'm a dancer.

30:59.748 --> 31:00.847
Disco?

31:00.849 --> 31:02.248
Ballet.

31:02.250 --> 31:03.583
Anything I might have seen?

31:03.585 --> 31:06.285
Did you ever go to the ballet?

31:06.287 --> 31:07.487
No.

31:07.489 --> 31:10.990
Then you just answered
your own question.

31:10.992 --> 31:12.692
Hey Max, yeah?

31:12.694 --> 31:15.094
Have you lost anybody?

31:15.096 --> 31:16.162
You know.

31:16.164 --> 31:18.831
Not yet, but I'm worried.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.433
Sure.

31:20.435 --> 31:21.768
I hope.

31:23.337 --> 31:24.704
Are you married?

31:24.706 --> 31:26.773
I have a wife and son.

31:26.775 --> 31:28.374
They're safe for now.

31:28.376 --> 31:30.777
My neighbor has a bomb
shelter they're holding up in.

31:30.779 --> 31:32.745
How come you're not with them?

31:32.747 --> 31:35.014
Then who'd be here with you?

31:35.016 --> 31:36.082
Oh really?

31:37.251 --> 31:39.786
This thing came on us so fast.

31:39.788 --> 31:41.654
I was already here
when it started.

31:41.656 --> 31:43.623
And now unless I can find
an army tank lying around

31:43.625 --> 31:45.691
in the office,
I'm cut off from them.

31:45.693 --> 31:46.793
Sucks.

31:46.795 --> 31:48.928
It's enough to
know that they're safe.

31:48.930 --> 31:50.363
A bomb shelter, huh?

31:50.365 --> 31:51.764
That's convenient.

31:51.766 --> 31:53.966
It's ironic how I always
made fun of him for it.

31:53.968 --> 31:55.301
But now...

31:55.303 --> 31:56.636
Yeah.

31:56.638 --> 31:58.805
The world has changed.

31:58.807 --> 31:59.807
A lot.

32:01.775 --> 32:03.776
Hey Max, I just
thought of something.

32:03.778 --> 32:05.111
What's that?

32:05.113 --> 32:08.080
When my battery dies
I'm gonna lose you.

32:08.082 --> 32:10.616
Don't think about that now.

32:10.618 --> 32:12.151
We'll figure something out.

32:40.848 --> 32:41.848
Oh yeah.

32:54.194 --> 32:57.797
Hey Kirby, everything okay?

32:57.799 --> 33:00.266
There's something out there.

33:00.268 --> 33:01.767
Like what?

33:02.936 --> 33:06.739
I don't know, it looks
like it's in the road.

33:08.442 --> 33:09.675
I'm gonna go take a look.

33:09.677 --> 33:11.811
Kirby, stick to the plan.

33:11.813 --> 33:14.447
Remember, don't
leave the life boat.

33:14.449 --> 33:16.115
Quit being such a pussy.

33:16.117 --> 33:19.685
I was just, I was just
telling you where I'd be.

33:19.687 --> 33:21.988
Look, Kirby, I have
to lock things down here.

33:21.990 --> 33:26.259
But do me favor, when you
get back, let me know, okay?

34:14.274 --> 34:15.775
Hello?

34:15.777 --> 34:16.876
911.

35:19.873 --> 35:20.873
Max?

35:21.808 --> 35:23.142
Who's this?

35:23.144 --> 35:25.311
Marilyn Monroe.

35:25.313 --> 35:26.579
You doing okay?

35:26.581 --> 35:27.947
I hadn't heard from
you for awhile,

35:27.949 --> 35:32.084
so I wanted to check in
and make sure you're okay.

35:33.587 --> 35:35.654
I was worried about you.

36:06.787 --> 36:07.787
Hi!

36:16.930 --> 36:18.364
Hey baby.

36:18.366 --> 36:19.366
Hey.

36:41.589 --> 36:42.655
Oh my god!

37:45.753 --> 37:47.686
Hey, fuck off!

37:47.688 --> 37:50.022
Well that wasn't very nice.

37:51.124 --> 37:53.926
Just thought you
could use some help.

37:55.662 --> 37:56.662
Hey,

37:57.664 --> 37:59.265
sorry.

37:59.267 --> 38:01.100
I thought you were um,

38:02.769 --> 38:04.370
one of them.

38:04.372 --> 38:06.672
Car trouble is it?

38:06.674 --> 38:08.607
Yeah, how'd you guess?

38:08.609 --> 38:10.643
What you need are a
couple of pack mules

38:10.645 --> 38:12.077
to pull you along.

38:13.780 --> 38:17.816
You don't know where I can
get some pack mules, do ya?

38:29.629 --> 38:32.331
Like an old horse and buggy.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.634
Simple as paint.

38:35.636 --> 38:37.703
How do you get 'em to move?

38:37.705 --> 38:39.838
That's the fun part.

38:43.777 --> 38:44.777
Thanks.

38:45.745 --> 38:47.513
Don't mention it.

38:49.416 --> 38:52.484
You know, I can't
really pay you for this.

38:52.486 --> 38:54.019
No need.

38:54.021 --> 38:57.656
We survivors gotta
stick together.

38:57.658 --> 38:59.325
Sounds good to me.

39:00.427 --> 39:02.461
My place ain't far from here.

39:02.463 --> 39:05.998
I reckon you could use
a shower and a hot meal.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.633
Wouldn't say no.

39:11.771 --> 39:13.339
Come on, pull!

39:14.374 --> 39:16.575
Mindless sons-of-bitches!

39:18.645 --> 39:19.745
Come on!

39:21.081 --> 39:22.748
Hey Kirby, you there?

39:22.750 --> 39:22.748
I'm here.

39:22.750 --> 39:27.186
You were moving,
I've been calling for hours.

39:27.188 --> 39:28.787
Oh you were worried about me?

39:28.789 --> 39:30.089
You're sweet, Max.

39:30.091 --> 39:32.191
Just so glad to
hear that you're okay.

39:32.193 --> 39:33.792
So my driver found you?

39:33.794 --> 39:35.027
He never radioed in.

39:35.029 --> 39:35.861
No.

39:35.863 --> 39:37.329
Then how?

39:37.331 --> 39:40.799
Let's just call it
horsepower, leave it at that.

39:40.801 --> 39:44.970
Well should I still
bother you with a tow?

39:44.972 --> 39:45.771
Kirby?

39:45.773 --> 39:47.239
Huh? Oh, yeah.

39:48.441 --> 39:50.609
I don't know much longer
this current situation's

39:50.611 --> 39:51.877
gonna hold up.

39:52.946 --> 39:54.079
Git!

39:59.152 --> 40:00.319
Come on, pull!

40:01.454 --> 40:04.056
Pull, you mindless
sons-of-bitches!

40:05.692 --> 40:06.825
Pull!

40:11.665 --> 40:13.198
Stop!

40:13.200 --> 40:15.367
Stop, you sons-of-bitches.

40:17.270 --> 40:18.037
Git!

40:18.039 --> 40:19.738
Watch that basket.

40:21.675 --> 40:23.175
Get back!

40:23.177 --> 40:24.177
Get back!

40:45.665 --> 40:46.999
Well, here it is.

40:50.170 --> 40:51.704
Home sweetest home.

40:58.611 --> 41:00.879
Ezekiel M. Harrison, PHD.

41:03.350 --> 41:05.017
Oh, she's so pretty.

41:10.323 --> 41:11.323
Sorry.

41:18.698 --> 41:21.333
Shower's down the hall.

41:21.335 --> 41:25.604
Help yourself to whatever
you want from the fridge.

41:50.663 --> 41:51.663
Mm.

41:58.838 --> 42:00.339
Git!

42:02.008 --> 42:03.409
Sons-of-bitches!

42:36.042 --> 42:37.009
Git,

42:37.011 --> 42:38.243
git, git!

42:55.128 --> 42:57.095
Why do you feed them?

42:59.599 --> 43:01.733
Because they're hungry.

43:03.369 --> 43:05.737
Must bring 'em some pleasure.

43:06.973 --> 43:07.973
Some peace.

43:10.376 --> 43:13.745
Do you really think
they have feelings?

43:13.747 --> 43:14.747
Feelings?

43:21.354 --> 43:23.422
Well, let's see.

43:36.102 --> 43:37.102
Feel that?

43:39.973 --> 43:40.973
Feel that?

43:42.609 --> 43:44.776
I don't think she can feel that.

43:44.778 --> 43:45.878
No?

43:49.082 --> 43:50.415
How 'bout this?

43:53.086 --> 43:56.121
Little disembowelment for ya.

43:56.123 --> 43:57.123
Feel that?

44:20.947 --> 44:21.947
Oh god.

44:23.349 --> 44:25.517
Come a little bit closer.

44:33.793 --> 44:34.860
Leave me be.

44:36.796 --> 44:39.698
I don't think you
should stay here.

44:39.700 --> 44:40.700
No?

44:43.870 --> 44:45.871
And where would I go?

44:48.341 --> 44:51.710
You could come into
the city with me.

44:55.015 --> 44:57.316
And what is in the city?

45:00.853 --> 45:01.987
Survivors?

45:03.523 --> 45:04.523
Answers?

45:06.659 --> 45:07.759
Nah.

45:09.929 --> 45:10.929
Not me.

45:12.665 --> 45:13.632
You should go.

45:13.634 --> 45:14.600
Listen, I can't just leave...

45:14.602 --> 45:15.667
no really.

45:18.638 --> 45:21.506
Take what you want
from the house.

45:23.309 --> 45:24.309
I just,

45:30.750 --> 45:32.751
I gotta be alone now.

46:15.128 --> 46:16.128
Come on.

46:43.423 --> 46:46.491
Well Max, really
fucked this one up.

47:50.590 --> 47:52.157
What can I say?

48:10.643 --> 48:11.643
Hey Kirbs...

48:17.583 --> 48:20.619
You know I specialize in

48:20.621 --> 48:21.621
helping you

48:24.257 --> 48:25.457
unwind.

48:32.465 --> 48:33.732
Where are you?

48:36.269 --> 48:38.837
I miss you so much.

48:41.140 --> 48:42.140
Can't wait.

48:48.681 --> 48:52.150
It's been so long.

48:54.921 --> 48:56.688
Now let me see you.

49:01.093 --> 49:06.665
Just bear in mind,
in a few short hours,

49:06.667 --> 49:09.267
I'll be licking you

49:09.269 --> 49:10.836
all over.

49:36.762 --> 49:40.098
He was never any
good for you anyway.

49:56.616 --> 49:58.650
But you already knew that.

50:23.609 --> 50:24.609
Dee?

50:26.879 --> 50:29.681
Come on, Dee,
don't make me do this.

50:29.683 --> 50:31.750
You'll get hurt, Dee.
Come on!

51:27.641 --> 51:30.408
Oh!

51:35.982 --> 51:39.117
This is Max.

51:39.119 --> 51:40.685
Max? Good news.

51:41.954 --> 51:43.855
What's that noise?

51:43.857 --> 51:45.256
I'm coming to get you.

51:45.258 --> 51:46.257
You are?

51:46.259 --> 51:49.661
Yep, then we're gonna
go get your family.

51:49.663 --> 51:50.762
Sit tight.

51:59.639 --> 52:00.705
In your face!

52:02.509 --> 52:04.876
This stupid gun won't work.

52:08.681 --> 52:09.748
Not yet.

52:20.426 --> 52:22.761
You know things are bad
when a girl can't even get

52:22.763 --> 52:24.996
attention from the vultures.

52:29.168 --> 52:31.736
This is gonna suck, isn't it?

52:33.305 --> 52:34.305
Yeah.

52:38.644 --> 52:39.644
Yeah.

52:45.484 --> 52:46.484
Yeah.

52:49.655 --> 52:51.322
You with me, Maxwell?

53:20.119 --> 53:21.586
Don't worry, Max,

53:23.689 --> 53:24.689
I'm coming.

56:21.667 --> 56:24.002
Come on, you motherfuckers!

56:33.445 --> 56:34.445
Bring it!

56:51.764 --> 56:53.665
You fucking dick shooter!

57:51.323 --> 57:52.757
Fucking finish me!

57:54.660 --> 57:55.927
Fuck it, I'll do it myself.

57:55.929 --> 57:56.929
Fuck you!

58:09.942 --> 58:12.076
The fuck's wrong with you?

58:16.615 --> 58:17.849
I see how it is.

58:19.284 --> 58:21.419
Miss hardcore, huh?

58:31.430 --> 58:32.663
Please, come on!

58:34.199 --> 58:36.067
You can't let me turn.

58:37.169 --> 58:38.169
Please!

01:03:04.036 --> 01:03:05.036
Mervin?

01:03:13.278 --> 01:03:15.613
Jesus, don't shoot.

01:03:15.615 --> 01:03:16.914
Who are you?

01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:20.818
Hi, I'm Hillary from clerical.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.386
I'm so...

01:03:23.088 --> 01:03:24.422
It was quiet so I
thought I'd come down

01:03:24.424 --> 01:03:26.857
and scavenge for supplies.

01:03:26.859 --> 01:03:28.526
There more of you?

01:03:28.528 --> 01:03:32.830
Yeah, there's several of
us holding up on the roof.

01:03:44.643 --> 01:03:47.445
We need to get off this roof.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.715
And go where?

01:03:50.717 --> 01:03:52.616
We're in the safest
place we could be.

01:03:52.618 --> 01:03:53.718
No we're not.

01:03:55.153 --> 01:03:56.654
Where we gonna go?!

01:03:56.656 --> 01:03:59.690
There are hordes of
these things out here.

01:03:59.692 --> 01:04:03.160
Who left you in charge anyway?

01:04:03.162 --> 01:04:04.162
No one.

01:04:05.163 --> 01:04:07.098
But I know we stand a
damn sight better chance

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.033
if we stick together.

01:04:09.035 --> 01:04:09.834
All right?

01:04:09.836 --> 01:04:11.669
You know this.

01:04:11.671 --> 01:04:12.970
Max?

01:04:12.972 --> 01:04:13.972
Wait.

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:19.944
I know that voice.

01:04:24.217 --> 01:04:25.182
My god, are you okay?

01:04:25.184 --> 01:04:26.851
How did you get here?

01:04:26.853 --> 01:04:28.753
I'm alive.

01:04:28.755 --> 01:04:31.088
That's all that matters, right?

01:04:31.090 --> 01:04:33.124
Told you I'd come back for you.

01:04:33.126 --> 01:04:35.993
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:39.430
They're coming.

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:46.036
Quick, take positions!

01:04:46.038 --> 01:04:48.873
Everyone grab a weapon!

01:04:49.975 --> 01:04:50.975
Hey,

01:04:54.446 --> 01:04:56.313
you'll do better with these.

01:05:32.617 --> 01:05:35.786
You know how to
use one of those?

01:05:35.788 --> 01:05:36.654
No.

01:05:36.656 --> 01:05:37.688
Nothing to it.

01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:38.989
Take that end point
it at the bad guy

01:05:38.991 --> 01:05:41.659
and squeeze the trigger.

01:05:57.976 --> 01:05:59.977
You know what's crazy?

01:05:59.979 --> 01:06:01.512
We've been fighting
these guys off

01:06:01.514 --> 01:06:03.781
the last couple of nights.

01:06:07.118 --> 01:06:09.954
And each time they come back,
there's twice as many.

01:06:09.956 --> 01:06:13.858
May not be smart,
but they are persistent.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.866
I got one!

01:06:23.134 --> 01:06:26.170
Yeah, but you need to
shoot them in the head.

01:06:26.172 --> 01:06:27.638
Oh.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.707
You're good at this.

01:06:29.709 --> 01:06:31.342
Had a lot of time to
practice while I was waiting

01:06:31.344 --> 01:06:34.278
for that tow truck
that never came.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.047
Sorry about that.

01:06:43.422 --> 01:06:44.655
Be right back.

01:07:00.672 --> 01:07:01.805
I got a head shot!

01:07:01.807 --> 01:07:04.341
That's great, but we gotta move.

01:07:26.464 --> 01:07:27.998
We need a way down.

01:07:30.535 --> 01:07:31.535
That'll do.

01:07:32.537 --> 01:07:34.338
What, jump?

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:36.840
Trash bags will break your fall.

01:07:36.842 --> 01:07:38.342
Fuck that, no.

01:07:40.178 --> 01:07:41.178
Oh shit!

01:07:53.758 --> 01:07:54.858
I'm okay.

01:07:55.627 --> 01:07:58.162
Okay, everybody off the edge.

01:08:17.515 --> 01:08:18.983
You too, Max.

01:08:18.984 --> 01:08:20.384
Ladies first.

01:08:53.651 --> 01:08:54.651
Shit!

01:08:56.587 --> 01:08:57.854
Hold up!

01:08:57.857 --> 01:08:59.656
Max needs a minute.

01:09:03.795 --> 01:09:05.328
He's changing.

01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:06.964
No, no he's just,

01:09:06.966 --> 01:09:08.966
we... lady, we gotta go.

01:09:08.968 --> 01:09:10.466
No, I came too far for this.

01:09:10.469 --> 01:09:11.835
Max, stay with me.

01:09:14.171 --> 01:09:16.473
Listen, I can save him,
I just need something hot

01:09:16.475 --> 01:09:17.774
and something metal.

01:09:17.777 --> 01:09:19.443
Come on there's gotta
be something we can use,

01:09:19.444 --> 01:09:20.711
just look around!

01:09:20.712 --> 01:09:21.511
There's nothing we can do.

01:09:21.514 --> 01:09:22.779
We have to go!

01:09:24.616 --> 01:09:25.916
Max, look at me.

01:09:30.421 --> 01:09:31.822
Go,

01:09:31.823 --> 01:09:32.823
Kirby.

01:09:33.925 --> 01:09:36.126
I'm out of here.

01:09:36.127 --> 01:09:37.394
Wait for us.

01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:46.703
I went through hell
and back to find you.

01:09:46.705 --> 01:09:49.939
I'm not gonna leave you now.

01:09:49.942 --> 01:09:51.475
Go,

01:09:51.477 --> 01:09:52.776
now.

01:09:52.778 --> 01:09:54.378
This can't be how it ends.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.780
This isn't the end.

01:09:58.783 --> 01:10:00.851
Not for you.

01:10:01.619 --> 01:10:04.188
Keep moving, Kirby.

01:10:05.023 --> 01:10:07.091
Don't stop.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.428
And they'll never get you.

01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:26.877
Goodbye, Max.

01:12:01.005 --> 01:12:02.005
Hey.

01:12:24.829 --> 01:12:25.829
Hi.

01:12:27.599 --> 01:12:28.665
Hey.

01:12:28.667 --> 01:12:29.766
Aww...

01:12:31.269 --> 01:12:33.203
You wanna come with me?

01:12:37.675 --> 01:12:40.043
Just keep moving, Kirby.

01:12:40.045 --> 01:12:41.778
Follow the road.

01:16:24.001 --> 01:16:25.936
She shot my dick off!

01:16:26.305 --> 01:16:32.390
