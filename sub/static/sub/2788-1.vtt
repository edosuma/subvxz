00:46.279 --> 00:48.865
OK. There we are.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.367
Well, what a great evening. Thank you.

00:52.619 --> 00:55.497
If you want, I could come in, pour you a drink.

00:57.332 --> 01:01.043
I'll tell you the problem… I'm not thirsty.

01:02.628 --> 01:04.922
But I had a great time. Thank you.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.174
Goodnight.

01:16.225 --> 01:17.559
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- No luck.

01:17.644 --> 01:20.272
- <i>Why? What happened?</i>
- I don't know why.

01:20.354 --> 01:22.648
I have to try something else.

01:53.554 --> 01:55.348
What's this?

01:55.514 --> 01:57.434
- It's lobster.
- I've never had it.

01:58.350 --> 02:01.854
- OK.
- I don't think my mom wants me to eat it.

02:02.187 --> 02:04.065
Well, then, leave it.

02:22.542 --> 02:26.795
- Yeah… Good, huh?
- Hmm.

02:27.963 --> 02:29.174
Brave man.

02:47.066 --> 02:49.903
<i>Don't touch me! No, I don't want to hear it!</i>

02:49.986 --> 02:51.237
Just stay away from me!

02:51.321 --> 02:53.528
- Leave me alone! Stop!
- No, we're supposed to be here together!

03:19.558 --> 03:23.061
- Would you like another beer?
- No, thanks.

03:31.194 --> 03:35.073
Incredible. We have to go see your mum.

03:43.623 --> 03:45.709
- How is he?
- He's fine.

03:46.333 --> 03:49.671
- Did you get a job?
- Only two kinds of job on the island…

03:49.754 --> 03:51.046
Hotel or bank.

03:51.214 --> 03:54.383
Give rich people their lunch,
or give rich people their money.

03:54.634 --> 03:56.511
- Which?
- Lunch.

03:59.013 --> 04:01.141
- How was your lobster?
- Rubbery.

04:02.057 --> 04:03.268
It was kind of you.

04:03.351 --> 04:06.687
Forget it. I'd rather be with Aldous
than be on my own. I enjoy his company.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.482
You saved my bacon.

04:08.565 --> 04:10.900
If I can return the favour…

04:14.028 --> 04:15.864
Don't worry, I'll think of something.

04:16.238 --> 04:19.992
Bye, Aldous. Nice day, let's do it again.

04:21.452 --> 04:23.496
Don't you have a car?

04:23.579 --> 04:26.248
I left it in Cambridge.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.377
Goodnight.

04:43.934 --> 04:45.602
Hey, hey!

04:45.684 --> 04:48.396
- We know each other. Who are you?
- If you know me, you don't need to ask.

04:48.521 --> 04:50.857
- I know you, don't I?
- No, I don't think so.

04:50.940 --> 04:54.276
- You're bluffing, aren't you?
- I live nearby. Is that it?

04:54.486 --> 04:56.530
I'd bet a lot of money you and I have met.

04:56.612 --> 04:59.031
I'm sorry, I wish I could help.

05:13.045 --> 05:15.214
- Yeah?
- <i>I found your number.</i>

05:17.008 --> 05:20.053
- So that means you must know my name.
- <i>Come and have a drink this evening.</i>

05:20.136 --> 05:22.221
<i>There are some people I'd like you to meet.</i>

05:27.060 --> 05:29.479
- Are you still there?
- <i>I'm still here.</i>

05:29.562 --> 05:32.356
<i>If you don't, you'll spend the evening
worrying, "What did I miss?"</i>

05:32.441 --> 05:34.276
I don't worry. I never worry.

05:34.442 --> 05:36.903
I'm at the Shelter, you must know it.

06:26.495 --> 06:27.620
<i>You have reached a machine.</i>

06:27.704 --> 06:30.415
<i>Please leave your message, I will get back to you.</i>

06:31.958 --> 06:34.294
<i>You said to get in touch if ever I was in trouble.</i>

06:34.502 --> 06:37.463
Well, that's it. I'm in trouble.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.257
Bell me.

06:49.559 --> 06:51.060
- Hi, Margot.
- Morning.

06:51.143 --> 06:53.063
<i>Shares down 8% as closing price of $233…</i>

06:53.145 --> 06:54.730
<i>Hello? Stirling Rogers?</i>

06:56.274 --> 06:59.527
- You're looking cheerful.
- I just had a good workout. You should try it.

06:59.694 --> 07:01.737
Don't think the Prime Minister
wants to play squash with me.

07:01.904 --> 07:04.950
- Well, if he met you…
- No, my game's not good enough.

07:05.324 --> 07:06.910
- Do you ever win?
- Almost never.

07:07.619 --> 07:10.914
He'll play with anyone as long as
they give him a good game

07:10.997 --> 07:12.416
and he can beat them.

07:12.915 --> 07:14.209
That's Alec.

07:14.292 --> 07:18.672
- What are you up to?
- Nothing special. Fishing for clients. You?

07:20.089 --> 07:22.384
- Oh, planning the future.
- Mmm.

07:26.596 --> 07:28.681
- Anything urgent?
- Nothing.

07:29.391 --> 07:31.267
OK.

07:44.030 --> 07:47.366
- Tom, great you could make it.
- Why wouldn't I?

07:47.450 --> 07:51.329
-Only problem with paradise, nothing to do!

07:53.623 --> 07:57.335
You must find it boring after such an eventful life.

07:57.419 --> 07:58.836
How do you know about my life?

07:58.920 --> 08:01.882
Please don't insult my intelligence.

08:01.964 --> 08:04.926
Keep cool, keep calm.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.763
Don't say too much. OK.

08:15.812 --> 08:17.773
And now, introductions.

08:18.399 --> 08:19.982
No, you go first.

08:20.359 --> 08:23.069
Gary, Frank, Dido,

08:23.445 --> 08:25.406
this is Tom Eliot.

08:25.613 --> 08:27.281
- He's English.
- British.

08:27.449 --> 08:30.076
Well, we can spend the next hour debating the difference.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.537
In my book you're English.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.996
-Englishman!

08:38.168 --> 08:40.129
So, now, perhaps you'll tell me what's your name.

08:40.211 --> 08:42.047
- <i>Who is this guy?</i>
- Are you serious?

08:42.130 --> 08:44.674
He comes for a drink, he doesn't know who you are?

08:44.758 --> 08:46.175
I'm Curtis Pelissier.

08:46.385 --> 08:48.762
- Of course you are.
- I'm the host.

08:48.970 --> 08:51.724
Gary, remember, I can ask who I want.

08:52.516 --> 08:56.854
♪ <i>I fall in love too easily</i>

09:00.606 --> 09:05.403
♪ <i>I fall in love too fast</i> ♪

09:07.990 --> 09:12.243
At the end of the day, go private,
because you want to know something?

09:12.327 --> 09:13.620
It works out cheaper.

09:13.703 --> 09:18.000
Cross the Atlantic, say, by the time
you buy tickets for the kids and the nanny

09:18.083 --> 09:22.128
and the… Oh, Christ,
just pay the 50 and travel in comfort.

09:22.629 --> 09:25.090
Don't have to listen to other people,
that's worth $50,000…

09:25.174 --> 09:26.216
Dido, you're crazy.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.635
- You've lost all sense of what's going on.
- Oh, have I?

09:28.886 --> 09:32.180
I don't notice you piling into JetBlue.

09:32.723 --> 09:34.849
You know, people have this contempt for money

09:34.974 --> 09:38.270
because nowadays nobody’s allowed to say
what everyone knows…

09:38.353 --> 09:40.939
That money is the best way of keeping score.

09:41.023 --> 09:44.692
- <i>Dido, you're full of shit.</i>
- <i>I am not full of shit, I am telling you…</i>

09:44.817 --> 09:47.321
- I don't think we've met.
- No, you're right. Hello.

09:47.529 --> 09:49.406
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

09:50.199 --> 09:53.535
- How do you know Curtis?
- Um… I don't.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.828
Then why did he invite you?

09:55.996 --> 09:58.247
Interesting, I've been asking that myself.

09:58.373 --> 10:00.667
I take it you're a friend of his?

10:01.292 --> 10:02.836
I'm a friend of everyone here.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.672
So, who are they, exactly?

10:06.298 --> 10:10.344
Entrepreneurs. They run a company called Gladstone.

10:10.551 --> 10:13.847
- You must have heard of it.
- Gladstone… Have I? What do you do?

10:14.640 --> 10:18.477
- Are you asking me?
- Yeah, I just asked.

10:19.395 --> 10:22.021
- I'm a financial PR.
- Meaning?

10:22.814 --> 10:25.024
Well, if you haven't heard of Gladstone,
then that's my fault.

10:27.152 --> 10:29.363
Once upon a time, back in the old days,

10:29.445 --> 10:34.702
it would take a whole lifetime to destroy
the reputation of a politician or a banker…

10:35.619 --> 10:40.708
But now, as we know, someone
just hits "send" and it can happen overnight…

10:40.790 --> 10:44.502
And usually does. So it's my job
to keep the company’s good name.

10:44.670 --> 10:46.087
Does Gladstone have a good name?

10:47.423 --> 10:49.674
Good enough.

10:49.758 --> 10:51.676
- Tom Eliot.
- Melanie Fall.

10:51.801 --> 10:53.177
Maybe it's a little classier idea.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.681
It's about exclusivity.
It's about grabbing the moment.

10:56.265 --> 10:58.141
So, Tom, what do you think?

10:59.100 --> 11:00.978
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening…

11:01.228 --> 11:03.813
Clearly. Frank was saying…

11:03.938 --> 11:06.233
I was just saying, we're in business, you know,

11:06.317 --> 11:10.320
so we want to make something that's popular,
but we also want it to be exclusive.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.489
That's a paradox. That's a challenge.

11:12.948 --> 11:14.616
- It's what Stirling always says…
- Stirling?

11:14.909 --> 11:16.869
- Stirling Rogers.
- Rogers is a friend of yours?

11:16.952 --> 11:19.413
- He's an associate.
- Stirling says, by definition,

11:19.495 --> 11:21.957
exclusivity means "for the few".

11:22.416 --> 11:26.003
So, if we just catered for the few,
we don't make any money.

11:26.253 --> 11:31.424
Example. This is a nice hotel,
but you build 200 of them…

11:31.507 --> 11:34.345
All of a sudden, people say it's not so nice any more.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.971
So, how do you solve this dilemma?

11:37.055 --> 11:38.390
How do you solve it, Tom?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.892
I'm not the man to ask. I'm retired.

11:40.976 --> 11:42.769
What business were you in, Mr Eliot?

11:43.145 --> 11:44.729
I was a civil servant.

11:44.979 --> 11:46.190
- Where?
- In London.

11:46.356 --> 11:48.609
- Which ministry?
- Agriculture and Fisheries.

11:48.691 --> 11:52.655
I know a lot about cod.
Salmon quotas, that sort of thing.

11:52.820 --> 11:56.158
Answer me this. How can you afford to live here?

11:56.700 --> 11:59.911
Oh, the answer is… I can't.

12:01.831 --> 12:06.167
They probably gave him one of those
socialised pensions. Lives off it for life.

12:06.251 --> 12:07.293
It's modest, actually.

12:07.378 --> 12:10.756
The rest of us poor bastards,
we worked every minute on the clock.

12:10.881 --> 12:13.175
- Turns out, we were in the wrong game.
- Dido, calm down.

12:13.259 --> 12:18.055
Big mistake, should have lived off
other people like a socialistic left-wing dick.

12:20.933 --> 12:25.019
This guy can live on the islands
because he's got gold-plated security.

12:25.104 --> 12:28.273
While we were out there, we were taking risks.

12:29.942 --> 12:33.153
Tell you what happens to people who take risks…

12:33.237 --> 12:37.825
They get screwed by people who never
took a fucking risk in their lives.

12:38.741 --> 12:42.787
That's the way it is. There are a few people
who lead, who innovate…

12:43.205 --> 12:45.249
And then there's the rest.

12:48.126 --> 12:51.212
- I'm sorry.
- There's no need to apologise, really.

12:51.297 --> 12:55.300
Dido is a difficult man going through a difficult time.

12:55.383 --> 12:58.511
- What sort of time?
- Well, the recession.

12:58.636 --> 13:00.931
Oh, the recession, I see.

13:01.015 --> 13:04.018
No recession and he would have been pleasanter, would he?

13:05.727 --> 13:11.024
I'd say, throw in Asperger's,
and it's a dangerous mix, be-definitely.

13:11.108 --> 13:15.154
- Are you gonna stay for dinner?
- Funny, I think I might skip it, if that's OK.

13:15.236 --> 13:18.032
I was thinking you and I could meet up tomorrow maybe

13:18.114 --> 13:19.700
in a less pressured environment?

13:19.784 --> 13:22.368
You mean less pressured than this?

13:25.288 --> 13:29.125
- I enjoyed meeting you, Tom.
- Yes, so did I.

13:30.419 --> 13:32.587
I'd like to see you again.

13:50.105 --> 13:51.899
- <i>It's what Stirling always says…</i>
- <i>Stirling?</i>

13:51.982 --> 13:53.900
- <i>Stirling Rogers.</i>
- <i>Rogers is a friend of yours?</i>

13:53.984 --> 13:56.236
- <i>He's an associate.</i>
- <i>Stirling says, by definition,</i>

13:56.319 --> 13:57.862
<i>exclusivity means…</i>

14:04.412 --> 14:07.415
<i>I don't want to be remembered
as someone who just took things out,</i>

14:07.498 --> 14:09.375
<i>I want to put something back.</i>

14:09.500 --> 14:12.335
<i>That's why I'm financing my new foundation, The Bridge,</i>

14:12.419 --> 14:17.508
<i>which will set to work solving some of
the world's most intractable problems.</i>

14:40.572 --> 14:44.909
- <i>Across the UK…</i>
- <i>This is BBC Radio 5 Live.</i>

14:45.995 --> 14:47.871
<i>Welcome to 5 Live News.</i>

14:47.955 --> 14:51.624
<i>The Prime Minister, Alec Beasley,
visiting his constituency today</i>

14:51.708 --> 14:55.004
<i>spoke of the need for everyone
in the country to keep their nerve.</i>

14:55.086 --> 14:57.089
<i>This has been a global recession</i>

14:57.172 --> 15:01.092
<i>and all the suffering and the sacrifices

15:01.177 --> 15:03.262
<i>And this is not the moment…</i>

15:19.236 --> 15:22.240
<i>This is interesting, this is getting interesting.</i>

15:22.322 --> 15:25.117
<i>Looks like I've lucked into some men we know about,</i>

15:25.200 --> 15:28.453
<i>but it's dangerous. I need your help.</i>

15:29.162 --> 15:32.165
-<i>I need to know. Are you getting these calls?</i>

15:32.248 --> 15:35.253
<i>It's urgent. I need to hear from you now.</i>

15:38.589 --> 15:40.675
<i>Come quickly!</i>

15:41.509 --> 15:45.179
Help! Yo, Byron, help me!

15:45.262 --> 15:47.640
- Do you know what's happening?
- No idea.

15:47.765 --> 15:49.766
-Yo! Yo, what's going on?

15:53.228 --> 15:55.188
Quick! Hurry!

16:49.285 --> 16:53.955
<i>Big mistake, should have lived off
other people like a socialistic left-wing…</i>

17:03.215 --> 17:05.926
- Yes.
- <i>Hi, Tom. It's Melanie Fall.</i>

17:06.009 --> 17:07.094
Melanie.

17:07.345 --> 17:09.972
Did you hear the news? I can't believe it.

17:10.055 --> 17:14.351
We spent the whole evening telling Dido
how offensive he was being.

17:14.809 --> 17:17.479
- <i>Does that mean you went to dinner?</i>
- I did.

17:17.561 --> 17:20.566
And then I got bored and left them arguing.

17:20.650 --> 17:23.359
<i>Really? What were they arguing about?</i>

17:24.986 --> 17:27.698
- Where are you today?
- I'm at home.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.367
-<i>You want to get together?</i>

17:29.909 --> 17:33.203
Melanie, forgive me, I'd love
to meet up, but I have visitors.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.248
<i>This is nice.</i>

17:36.624 --> 17:38.584
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

17:38.667 --> 17:41.504
I'm Jim Carroll. This is Little Harry.

17:41.586 --> 17:43.547
Harry. Tom Eliot.

17:43.672 --> 17:46.341
We're both policemen.
This morning a man was murdered.

17:46.592 --> 17:48.426
He was hit on the head and thrown in the sea.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.680
Was it definitely murder? I saw what happened.

17:52.056 --> 17:55.768
- I don't mean…
- Uh, OK. Dig yourself out.

17:55.852 --> 17:59.396
I don't mean I saw the murder, but I did see
the body being pulled up onto the beach.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.815
- And you recognised the victim?
- I met him last night.

18:02.108 --> 18:03.900
For the first time?

18:04.860 --> 18:08.113
- How did you meet him?
- I was asked for a drink by Curtis Pelissier.

18:08.196 --> 18:10.908
- Is he a friend of yours?
- As a matter of fact, not.

18:10.991 --> 18:13.661
- Then how does he know you?
- As I say, I don't think he did.

18:13.827 --> 18:16.079
Then why would you go?
Why would you go for a drink?

18:16.580 --> 18:17.915
I'm gonna throw this back at you, Jim.

18:17.998 --> 18:20.625
Believe it or not, it's quite unusual
to be approached by someone

18:20.710 --> 18:22.253
who claims to know you when they don't.

18:22.378 --> 18:23.921
That's why I went. I was intrigued.

18:24.004 --> 18:26.882
If I'd known one of the party
was going to be killed, I wouldn't have gone.

18:27.132 --> 18:28.675
Oh, I dare say neither would he.

18:30.510 --> 18:34.055
And people say you and Dido
got into some sort of violent dispute.

18:34.265 --> 18:36.976
- Violent? No.
- What, then?

18:37.059 --> 18:40.562
By simply existing, I seemed to offend his politics.

18:40.979 --> 18:43.983
- You work in public service?
- You're right. You're well informed.

18:44.066 --> 18:48.321
Even so, I've never heard of anyone killing
anyone else because they were a civil servant.

18:48.571 --> 18:50.031
Mmm.

18:50.489 --> 18:53.200
- You gonna mind if I take a look inside?
- Be my guest.

18:57.205 --> 19:00.583
You've been here a month or two.
You had some work done.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.167
It's a small island, Mr Eliot.

19:02.251 --> 19:04.837
You can't build a steel security unit
without everyone knowing.

19:05.254 --> 19:08.257
- I wouldn't call it a security unit.
- Wouldn't you?

19:08.340 --> 19:12.178
- What would you call it?
- Oh, it's just my personal stuff.

19:14.846 --> 19:19.102
OK, I'm going to show it to you,
and then you can put your mind at rest.

19:23.272 --> 19:26.109
Well, it's the first time in my life
I've ever seen clothes locked away.

19:26.275 --> 19:29.612
Some people keep their money in claret,
I keep mine in shirts.

19:29.862 --> 19:33.073
Of course, all of mine have a little crocodile sewn on.

19:34.450 --> 19:38.871
Well, it makes me wonder what you'd build
if you had something really valuable.

19:39.289 --> 19:40.581
Hmm…

19:42.417 --> 19:44.292
I'm going to say goodbye to you.

19:44.377 --> 19:46.628
I wonder, before you go, could I ask you a question?

19:46.713 --> 19:49.256
What was Dido Parsons doing on the island?

19:49.340 --> 19:52.343
Gladstone International’s based here, remember?

19:52.427 --> 19:54.637
- Tax purposes.
- That was his only reason?

19:54.720 --> 19:58.016
In a few days there's going to be
this international colloquium

19:58.098 --> 20:01.060
and this place will be crawling with
rich and powerful people.

20:01.268 --> 20:04.396
The world's leading business people and politicians.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.774
What, four days in the sun
and they conclude that global recovery

20:07.858 --> 20:09.318
depends on them making more money?

20:09.527 --> 20:12.780
They're rich men.
They can waste their time any way they want.

20:13.406 --> 20:17.493
I think Dido came here early because
he and his friends are planning a new hotel.

20:17.577 --> 20:20.037
As if what Belongers need are more hotels.

20:20.162 --> 20:23.165
- What do you need, Mr Carroll?
- I'll tell you what…

20:23.248 --> 20:26.668
Belongers need regular jobs for regular people.

20:26.753 --> 20:29.004
Isn't that what a hotel would bring?

20:29.088 --> 20:33.175
So far all it's brought is a bunch of
doubtful-looking men from New Jersey…

20:33.259 --> 20:35.303
And a body on the beach.

20:41.059 --> 20:42.602
Here she is now.

20:43.144 --> 20:45.938
Well, we didn't know if you were going to make it.

20:46.022 --> 20:48.107
Why wouldn't I make it?

20:48.190 --> 20:51.236
We thought you might have taken to your bed.

20:51.903 --> 20:54.322
And you, gentlemen, how are you coping?

20:54.404 --> 20:56.490
Managing to contain yourselves, I see.

20:56.574 --> 20:59.410
- Have you seen the police?
- Not yet. Have you?

20:59.493 --> 21:00.661
They took away our passports.

21:00.745 --> 21:02.539
- I'd like a large Scotch.
- <i>Certainly.</i>

21:02.621 --> 21:05.333
Frank and I were wondering, who's the new one?

21:06.416 --> 21:08.044
The one called Eliot.

21:08.126 --> 21:11.755
We've already got Pelissier to deal with,
now there's an Englishman as well.

21:12.215 --> 21:15.051
-Well, I like the Englishman.

21:15.593 --> 21:18.762
- Can I ask something else?
- Go ahead. Ask whatever you like.

21:19.514 --> 21:21.975
Where'd you go last night after you left us?

21:24.643 --> 21:26.437
Melanie…

21:26.521 --> 21:30.524
In about a half an hour I might have to
call Mrs Parsons and tell her what happened.

21:30.817 --> 21:34.362
If there's anything you can add, I need to know.

21:38.032 --> 21:41.368
- Well?
- Well, what?

21:41.994 --> 21:44.164
What do you want me to say?

21:44.247 --> 21:48.209
If you can find the right Mrs Parsons,
Gary, then good luck to you,

21:48.293 --> 21:52.088
because I've met at least five women
who have had that honour.

21:52.171 --> 21:55.758
There's one that was running
a dry cleaning business in LA,

21:55.842 --> 21:58.927
and wasn't there one that was temping in pest control?

21:59.012 --> 22:04.308
So, if you can remember which one is which,
then you have a better memory than I do.

22:04.683 --> 22:08.061
So, please, don't tear at my heart-strings

22:08.146 --> 22:11.024
about some woman who just won a game of musical chairs,

22:11.107 --> 22:15.153
because, frankly, I don't think
Dido cared any more than I do.

22:15.820 --> 22:17.821
Or you.

22:17.906 --> 22:20.533
Ah, good. Is that my Scotch?

22:29.375 --> 22:31.919
Excuse me, I'm looking to have a word with the manager.

22:32.003 --> 22:33.296
I am he.

22:33.587 --> 22:36.549
Then I want to ask it's still possible to buy a pavilion.

22:37.342 --> 22:39.968
I think there may be one or two left.

22:40.093 --> 22:42.095
- How are they priced?
- They're priced at 15.

22:42.305 --> 22:44.891
- Fifteen million?
- That's in American dollars, sir.

22:44.973 --> 22:47.894
-Of course it is.

22:48.060 --> 22:49.729
Well, plus running costs.

22:49.813 --> 22:53.398
You own it, we rent it out for you
in the weeks you're not using it.

22:53.483 --> 22:55.318
- I'll get the key.
- Thank you.

23:14.545 --> 23:17.256
Am I mistaken, or did I see you here
having a drink the other night?

23:17.506 --> 23:19.883
- You're very observant.
- With Mr Parsons?

23:20.926 --> 23:24.847
Large bathroom, shower, jacuzzi.

23:24.930 --> 23:28.393
Dido was telling me about a rival hotel
he was planning. Have you heard about it?

23:28.685 --> 23:31.021
- Only rumours.
- Does it bother you?

23:31.103 --> 23:33.898
For a start, we own a large chunk of the island.

23:33.981 --> 23:35.817
We have the best beaches on Turks and Caicos.

23:35.899 --> 23:38.028
- Who are "we"?
- I'm talking about our investors…

23:38.110 --> 23:40.947
Ah, yes. My friend wanted me to ask
who those investors were.

23:42.365 --> 23:45.659
- Well, it's a very good question.
- You don't know who owns the hotel?

23:46.869 --> 23:49.664
I know who owned it yesterday,
but I don't know who owns it today.

23:49.955 --> 23:53.625
- How come?
- Because that's the way of things now.

23:55.335 --> 23:59.757
Mr Eliot, I used to be able to open the bonnet,
take out a wrench and fix my car.

23:59.841 --> 24:02.552
Now I'd need a degree in electronics.

24:02.634 --> 24:04.638
Even easy things are difficult now.

24:07.681 --> 24:10.851
Perhaps you'll stay for a Bellini on the house?

24:10.935 --> 24:14.855
I have to get going, the police are
going to release Mr Parsons' room.

24:14.939 --> 24:16.815
Do you have someone staying there tonight?

24:16.900 --> 24:19.318
It may sound heartless, but that's the hotel business.

24:19.443 --> 24:21.821
I'm only as good as my occupancy rate.

24:22.489 --> 24:24.699
In the door and out?

24:35.001 --> 24:36.461
You're going to get me sacked.

24:36.543 --> 24:39.547
I won't get you sacked, I'll get you promoted.

24:41.633 --> 24:45.260
Follow me at a distance.
Like you don't know me, but you'd like to.

25:02.904 --> 25:04.947
This guy, Pelissier, gives nothing away.

25:05.572 --> 25:08.910
I've been cleaning his room three days,
you wouldn't know he was here.

25:09.118 --> 25:10.453
Huh.

25:11.746 --> 25:13.163
Girlfriend? Celibate?

25:13.289 --> 25:16.166
Celibate, sure. If celibate’s a kind of fish.

25:19.462 --> 25:25.218
If I were a detective, I'd say the way
there's nothing suspicious is very suspicious.

25:26.176 --> 25:28.346
You should leave. I don't want you caught.

25:48.783 --> 25:51.577
"Curtis Pelissier", indeed!

26:00.629 --> 26:01.922
- Yes.
- <i>Good morning.</i>

26:02.004 --> 26:03.172
<i>It's your old friend, Rollo.</i>

26:03.256 --> 26:05.884
Rollo, I don't believe it! You got my messages.

26:05.967 --> 26:08.427
<i>I couldn't miss them.
I can smell panic at 3,000 miles.</i>

26:08.510 --> 26:11.181
It's not panic, it's opportunity.

26:11.263 --> 26:14.226
OK, it looks like I have been identified
by an American colleague.

26:14.309 --> 26:17.269
That's not an opportunity, that's a disaster.

26:17.354 --> 26:20.357
<i>It could be a disaster, yes,
but I'm planning to play him along.</i>

26:21.775 --> 26:24.402
Well, to do that, you would
need to be cleverer than he is.

26:24.486 --> 26:25.529
Do you think that's possible?

26:25.611 --> 26:27.029
Well, we're going to find out, aren't we?

26:27.113 --> 26:28.364
You're not just making a run for it?

26:28.447 --> 26:29.723
<i>If I were you, I'd make a run for it.</i>

26:29.782 --> 26:32.618
In a few days there's this thing
called The Island Colloquium

26:32.702 --> 26:35.330
run by a man called Stirling Rogers.
You must have heard of him.

26:35.412 --> 26:37.958
Everyone's heard of him. Private equity.
He's buying up most of England.

26:38.083 --> 26:39.251
Not just England.

26:39.334 --> 26:42.587
Turns out he's a business associate
of the men we're interested in.

26:42.670 --> 26:44.088
- The men from New Jersey?
- <i>Yup.</i>

26:44.172 --> 26:45.798
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

26:45.882 --> 26:47.508
Margot.

26:48.343 --> 26:50.886
- <i>I'm sorry?</i>
- Margot works for Rogers.

26:52.013 --> 26:55.684
After she left Millbank shit-smart,
too clever to be a spy. That's where she went.

26:58.270 --> 27:01.814
- Johnny, is this a good idea?
- Rollo, shouldn't I decide that?

27:01.898 --> 27:06.694
Look, if you stay where you are, the CIA
are gonna be bringing you home in a cage.

27:07.112 --> 27:11.408
That's a chance I'm gonna have to take.
I need you to find Margot.

27:12.075 --> 27:16.162
I want everything she can tell us about Stirling Rogers.

27:30.218 --> 27:32.595
<i>The next station is London Bridge.</i>

27:32.679 --> 27:36.390
<i>Change for the Northern Line
and international rail services.</i>

27:39.186 --> 27:42.314
<i>This station is London Bridge.
Change here for…</i>

27:56.370 --> 27:58.662
Well, I thought it was you.

27:58.747 --> 28:00.457
I was worried you might remember me.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.166
Of course I remember you.

28:02.250 --> 28:04.376
And I spotted you way back.
I spotted you at Aldgate East.

28:04.461 --> 28:08.256
- You did not. When I got on?
- Yeah. You did that backward thing.

28:09.340 --> 28:11.134
Did no-one ever teach you it's much more effective

28:11.218 --> 28:14.096
- to tail someone by going ahead.
- Margot, I taught the fucking course!

28:14.178 --> 28:15.806
- Always go in front!
- I know.

28:15.888 --> 28:18.266
I just never believed it. It's counter-intuitive.

28:18.349 --> 28:19.726
Well, now you're paying the price.

28:26.315 --> 28:28.150
You don't look good.

28:28.443 --> 28:30.611
That's because I've been clubbing till an hour ago.

28:31.029 --> 28:34.074
- It's almost 9:00.
- Yeah. Unfortunately there's a new bylaw.

28:34.157 --> 28:39.037
Men under 25 not permitted to fuck older men
until 6:00 in the morning.

28:39.287 --> 28:40.788
What do you do, take a book?

28:40.871 --> 28:43.959
A book and a pillow, yeah.

28:47.044 --> 28:49.548
So, how is Johnny?

28:49.630 --> 28:53.009
It's along story. As it happens, we're both
discredited and we're both disgraced.

28:53.134 --> 28:55.595
- What do you do now?
- I work for the <i>Financial Times</i>.

28:55.679 --> 28:58.181
But, anyway, the point is this…

28:58.264 --> 29:02.227
Johnny asked me to get in touch. By the way,
he said to say sorry for how long it's been.

29:02.311 --> 29:03.978
- Hmm, four years.
- Really?

29:04.062 --> 29:06.939
Four years, three months, a handful of days…

29:07.024 --> 29:08.774
You're not counting?

29:10.109 --> 29:12.194
And if it's so important, why didn't he come himself?

29:12.279 --> 29:14.448
- He couldn't come.
- Couldn't? Why not?

29:14.823 --> 29:16.825
Because he had to leave the country.

29:17.326 --> 29:18.493
Had to?

29:21.872 --> 29:23.622
I'm surprised.

29:24.957 --> 29:26.917
Johnny was a good man.

29:27.835 --> 29:31.131
- And much the cleverest in the building.
- He's still a good man.

29:31.256 --> 29:33.258
It's the building that's changed.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.262
Rollo, I really have left that world.

29:38.387 --> 29:41.390
- I don't want to have anything to do with it.
- Quite understand.

29:41.475 --> 29:44.352
I work for Stirling Rogers…
But you probably knew that already.

29:44.436 --> 29:46.604
Well, that's what Johnny needed to talk to you about.

29:46.688 --> 29:48.232
Goon.

29:48.314 --> 29:50.943
Everyone reckons that Stirling Rogers
is completely legitimate.

29:51.025 --> 29:53.320
Certainly is. He plays squash
with the Prime Minister.

29:53.445 --> 29:55.196
- People question his methods.
- Sure.

29:55.280 --> 29:59.701
- He has a reputation.
- He's tough. He has to be. He's private equity.

30:00.369 --> 30:02.912
He buys a failing business, he makes it work.

30:02.995 --> 30:08.001
The chariot goes at a certain speed.
Peasants fall under the wheels. That happens.

30:08.084 --> 30:12.380
I'm sure it does. Johnny thought you
might be able to give him the inside track.

30:12.464 --> 30:13.882
- On what?
- On his links.

30:13.965 --> 30:16.550
On his links to some people
that might not smell as savoury as he does.

30:19.053 --> 30:22.974
- Are you shocked?
- I'm not shocked, I'm just unwilling.

30:23.057 --> 30:25.269
I'm not in the business of betraying my boss.

30:25.434 --> 30:28.062
It's the international side that interests us.

30:28.187 --> 30:31.315
- In particular?
- The American side.

30:33.610 --> 30:36.654
- I saw a flicker in there.
- No, you saw no flicker.

30:37.029 --> 30:40.909
Margot, I cannot tell you how serious this is.

30:40.993 --> 30:43.828
- It may be a life-saving thing.
- Saving Johnny's life, you mean?

30:43.911 --> 30:45.455
What happens to mine?

30:45.539 --> 30:49.251
Remember, I have a good job, security, incredible salary.

30:50.002 --> 30:52.128
Family?

31:00.761 --> 31:04.765
Normally, when a man asks you to risk everything,

31:05.725 --> 31:07.853
he does it in person.

31:15.067 --> 31:17.488
Did he ever give you the talk about trust?

31:17.779 --> 31:18.906
What talk is that?

31:19.405 --> 31:23.034
Oh, Johnny used to always say that life is about trust.

31:23.368 --> 31:25.996
Trust isn't always rewarded,

31:26.079 --> 31:30.292
but on the other hand
if you make decisions based on trust,

31:31.667 --> 31:34.838
then they'll have a sort of rightness to them.

31:39.802 --> 31:41.052
Does that mean you're in?

32:00.071 --> 32:01.239
- Morning.
- Morning.

32:01.323 --> 32:03.409
Morning. Morning.

32:07.955 --> 32:11.083
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Good morning.

32:13.501 --> 32:17.047
- Anything you need to talk to me about?
- Nothing urgent.

32:18.548 --> 32:21.300
Well, there is something I wanted to ask.

32:21.385 --> 32:22.718
Ask.

32:23.345 --> 32:26.348
What exactly is happening with The Bridge?

32:47.578 --> 32:49.328
So, perhaps you're gonna tell me what you're doing here.

32:49.413 --> 32:52.039
You went into my room, I thought I'd go into yours.

32:52.124 --> 32:55.377
- Next stop, the Credit Bank of Panama.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

32:55.502 --> 32:57.378
Don't you?

32:57.545 --> 33:00.466
If your things are no longer in that safe,

33:00.883 --> 33:02.843
the only place they can be is the bank,

33:02.926 --> 33:05.636
unless you got that little boy to bury them in the sand.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.765
- What little boy is that?
- Didn't I see you the other day?

33:08.848 --> 33:11.225
You were eating lobster.

33:11.310 --> 33:14.271
- What's that line of Eliot's? Remind me.
- I don't know.

33:14.438 --> 33:19.442
"I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas"

33:19.567 --> 33:21.778
Sounds to me more like a crab, not like a lobster.

33:21.862 --> 33:25.823
Oh, that's why you took Eliot's name…
Because you like his poetry?

33:25.948 --> 33:28.159
I didn't take the name, I was given it.

33:28.326 --> 33:30.704
- Were you?
- My parents never read a line of poetry

33:30.787 --> 33:32.330
- in their lives.
- What were their names?

33:32.830 --> 33:36.250
Oh, Jean Eliot, Clifford. Why?

33:36.876 --> 33:38.170
Do you need a glass of water?

33:38.253 --> 33:41.799
Look, this is Turks and Caicos,
nobody’s who they claim to be.

33:41.881 --> 33:44.842
It's a home for dirty money,
which, as T S Eliot would observe,

33:44.927 --> 33:50.099
is a tautology because
there isn't any other kind these days.

33:51.684 --> 33:53.894
- I think you're fishing, Pelissier.
- Curtis.

33:54.227 --> 33:56.397
I'm a retired civil servant and that's it.

33:56.479 --> 33:59.691
If you were a retired civil servant,
you wouldn't come for a drink.

33:59.775 --> 34:01.360
I haven't agreed to come for a drink tonight.

34:01.443 --> 34:03.778
No, but you will, be-definitely.

34:11.495 --> 34:14.915
- It's an interesting place, isn't it?
- It certainly is.

34:14.998 --> 34:19.127
Nowadays people will go anywhere to avoid paying tax.

34:19.252 --> 34:23.382
A quick visit to Liechtenstein, Monaco, maybe Jersey…

34:24.300 --> 34:26.717
Empty the vaults of private wealth

34:26.801 --> 34:31.264
and you could write off the world's debt
in a day, in an hour, in a minute.

34:32.725 --> 34:36.395
Three-quarters of the world's cash
is hidden away in places exactly like this.

34:36.687 --> 34:39.023
- Turks and Caicos?
- $21 trillion…

34:39.106 --> 34:42.902
It exists, an entire alternative economy,

34:42.984 --> 34:48.197
and the only entry qualification,
the services of a good tax lawyer.

34:51.659 --> 34:55.121
- What ever happened to the idea of shame?
- Shame?

34:55.664 --> 34:58.542
Went the way of honour, didn't it?

35:03.212 --> 35:06.217
So, what do you think about the murder?

35:06.299 --> 35:07.634
I'm sorry?

35:07.717 --> 35:10.595
What was it, a mugging?
That's what his friends are saying.

35:10.679 --> 35:13.057
I'm afraid I assumed he was
knocked-off by an acquaintance.

35:13.140 --> 35:15.278
- Maybe somebody we had a drink with.
- Is that what you think?

35:15.308 --> 35:16.929
But then, you know those people better than me.

35:16.976 --> 35:20.521
Correction. I've spent five painful days
trying to get to know them.

35:20.939 --> 35:26.527
In fact, I was just getting close to Dido
when somebody whacked him on the head.

35:27.153 --> 35:28.656
Here we are.

35:29.865 --> 35:31.784
What was your mother's name again?

35:31.866 --> 35:34.452
My mother's named Jean, my father's Clifford.

35:34.537 --> 35:35.912
Oh, that's right, yes.

35:35.996 --> 35:38.915
My bad… Clifford.

35:48.800 --> 35:51.177
- You're doing that thing.
- What thing is that?

35:51.302 --> 35:55.933
That thing of pretending to drink.
I've had three, you've had none. I'm counting.

35:56.809 --> 36:00.061
Is that because you think of this meeting as work?

36:01.313 --> 36:03.357
OK, is this the moment?

36:05.693 --> 36:08.236
- You go first.
- I think you're CIA.

36:08.736 --> 36:10.698
- CIA?
- In one.

36:10.780 --> 36:13.784
- What makes you think that?
- Because you don't exist on the internet.

36:13.867 --> 36:16.078
Because you had my phone number in 30 seconds.

36:16.162 --> 36:17.496
Not hard to get on this island.

36:17.579 --> 36:19.748
- I could pay your maid.
- I don't have a maid.

36:19.832 --> 36:23.001
Just like you got my maid to help search my room?

36:25.378 --> 36:29.133
OK, I'm going to ask you a favour.

36:29.216 --> 36:32.344
Whatever else you do, please don't involve any maid.

36:32.427 --> 36:36.139
What is this? Old-fashioned gallantry?
What's her name? Natalie?

36:36.347 --> 36:41.479
- Now, for the first time, I see a human being.
- You're vulnerable, aren't you, Tom?

36:41.561 --> 36:45.274
- You don't like to see women get hurt?
- I don't like to see anyone get hurt.

36:45.649 --> 36:48.651
Do you know the story of St Augustine and the seashell?

36:48.736 --> 36:51.072
- Do you know, I don't.
- I keep thinking of it.

36:51.154 --> 36:55.909
St Augustine saw a child on the beach
trying to empty the sea with a shell.

36:56.243 --> 37:00.706
If you want to know what my work feels like
at the moment, then that sums things up.

37:01.623 --> 37:02.792
Tell me more.

37:04.292 --> 37:08.506
The people you had a drink with are first-class crooks.

37:08.589 --> 37:11.257
In fact, they're more than crooks.
They're contractors.

37:11.342 --> 37:13.719
- But you know that, don't you?
- Do I?

37:13.803 --> 37:16.055
Somebody told me they were here to build a hotel.

37:16.138 --> 37:19.475
They build hotels, yes,
when they're not doing other things.

37:19.557 --> 37:22.395
I came down here to take a good look at them.

37:22.477 --> 37:25.355
I couldn't believe my luck
when I saw you sitting on the beach,

37:25.439 --> 37:28.274
because it wasn't the first time I'd seen you.

37:28.359 --> 37:30.194
- Really?
- Yes.

37:30.276 --> 37:33.322
- I don't remember.
- I saw you, you didn't see me.

37:33.572 --> 37:35.616
- Where?
- I was behind glass.

37:38.618 --> 37:39.870
Langley.

37:43.416 --> 37:47.169
Even more interesting, I got sent an alert
just a couple of months ago.

37:47.252 --> 37:49.087
- We all did.
- What sort of alert?

37:49.171 --> 37:50.965
When you left England.

37:51.048 --> 37:53.550
Congratulations, you're public enemy number one.

37:53.634 --> 37:56.178
Your prime minister hates you with a passion.

37:56.262 --> 37:58.097
Something to do with a file?

38:01.726 --> 38:03.893
A file you stole.

38:03.977 --> 38:07.481
I mean, Johnny, I don't want to blow smoke up your ass,

38:07.564 --> 38:14.070
but, in my opinion, you are the only man
who comes well out of the war on terror.

38:22.495 --> 38:23.914
Two more, please.

38:34.842 --> 38:39.722
Why, yes, it's been a fascinating few years,
you could say, since 9/11.

38:39.846 --> 38:42.724
Do you know how many Americans now work in Intelligence?

38:42.807 --> 38:45.227
- I don't know.
- Over 200,000.

38:45.352 --> 38:52.068
In 16 different agencies, with 30,000
private contractors in 170 countries

38:52.234 --> 38:57.155
at a grand cost to the taxpayer of $75 billion a year.

38:57.239 --> 39:00.492
And they still call it the Intelligence community.

39:00.618 --> 39:02.535
I don't think so.

39:02.619 --> 39:05.873
A new president came in and he made a promise.

39:06.165 --> 39:08.167
- No more torture.
- Close Guantanamo.

39:08.291 --> 39:10.544
Right. Only, guess what? It didn't happen.

39:10.627 --> 39:16.132
So, here I am, passing the time,
pretending to be a businessman.

39:16.259 --> 39:17.676
Is this with company approval?

39:18.344 --> 39:19.971
Remember…

39:22.014 --> 39:24.809
Only a few years back, America was rich.

39:24.892 --> 39:27.687
We could go to war.
We could fight all the wars we wanted,

39:27.770 --> 39:29.814
- and nobody counted the cost.
- You got ripped off?

39:29.938 --> 39:34.318
Royally. Now it's dusk in America
and people are sore.

39:35.193 --> 39:38.029
It's time for us to get our money back.

39:38.822 --> 39:42.076
And I'm guessing that prospect might interest you, too.

39:46.998 --> 39:48.541
All right, I'm going to propose a deal.

39:48.665 --> 39:50.750
Whatever it is, it's not going to be good enough.

39:50.877 --> 39:54.088
- How do you know?
- Johnny, you're dealing from an empty deck.

39:54.212 --> 39:59.718
Tall, thin Englishman with good manners
in a good suit. Not many of those.

39:59.844 --> 40:03.889
You're going to be spotted wherever you go,
and let's face it,

40:04.473 --> 40:08.560
there's nothing in the world so blown as a blown spy.

40:11.564 --> 40:13.858
OK, I'm going to help you pull in these crooks.

40:14.024 --> 40:17.944
- That's what I was hoping.
- And in return, you're going to let me go.

40:18.153 --> 40:20.822
Why would I do that? I'm a patriotic American.

40:21.072 --> 40:23.493
You're not going to call London,
you're not going to call Langley.

40:23.576 --> 40:27.037
We're gonna do the job and you're
gonna give me 24 hours to get away.

40:27.163 --> 40:30.791
You do well out of it, I do better.
Is that a deal?

40:39.634 --> 40:42.427
There is something wrong with Melanie Fall.

40:43.178 --> 40:44.931
She's damaged.

40:45.890 --> 40:48.099
I want you to find out why.

40:49.726 --> 40:52.522
<i>In his memoirs, Shostakovich asks his readers</i>

40:52.604 --> 40:54.689
<i>if they know the line from a Russian children's story</i>

40:54.774 --> 40:57.567
<i>about how hard it is to pull a hippo from a swamp.</i>

40:57.735 --> 41:01.781
<i>“Well, " says Shostakovich, " I'm pulling
a hippo from the swamp of my memory.</i>

41:01.864 --> 41:04.574
<i>"The hippo's name is Glazunov."</i>

41:36.190 --> 41:38.441
- Madam, if I may?
- Thank you.

41:42.320 --> 41:44.489
We don't do this often enough.

41:44.574 --> 41:47.243
Yeah, not for want of trying, on my part, at least.

41:49.537 --> 41:52.789
- Are you gonna to have wine?
- I certainly am.

41:52.999 --> 41:55.501
Give me a moment, I'm gonna choose something serious.

41:57.252 --> 42:04.135
I, um, felt it was time we addressed fundamentals.

42:04.301 --> 42:05.635
Fundamentals are good.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.929
I suppose I've been trying to understand the pattern.

42:08.764 --> 42:11.016
- Pattern?
- Pattern of what businesses we buy.

42:11.142 --> 42:12.601
- And why we buy them.
- Well, you know this stuff.

42:12.685 --> 42:14.812
Any business which presents a market opportunity.

42:14.896 --> 42:17.063
Yeah, but in practice, it's not
quite as simple as that, is it?

42:17.982 --> 42:19.858
There's got to be some ethical dimension.

42:19.941 --> 42:21.903
I wouldn't buy a brothel because I thought the whores

42:21.985 --> 42:23.320
could do more tricks to the hour.

42:23.404 --> 42:25.155
Exactly. This is what I'm interested in.

42:25.281 --> 42:28.825
I'm old-fashioned.
I like to think that if I do well,

42:28.910 --> 42:33.581
maybe achieve a certain style of life,
then I can raise the level around me.

42:33.664 --> 42:36.041
- As I go up, so do others.
- It's a great idea.

42:36.124 --> 42:37.835
This morning you asked about The Bridge.

42:37.918 --> 42:41.004
Well, this is what The Bridge is about.
We're putting something aside.

42:41.088 --> 42:44.132
Yeah, but to what end? Specifically?

42:44.216 --> 42:45.593
How's it going to work?

42:46.928 --> 42:49.722
Tell me, is this what you want to know?

42:50.639 --> 42:54.936
It's funny, I'm not sure I've ever quite known
what drew you to us in the first place.

42:55.019 --> 42:56.062
Haven't you?

42:56.144 --> 42:58.648
No, you never actually told me why you left Millbank.

42:59.440 --> 43:00.984
We had you checked out, of course we did,

43:01.066 --> 43:03.985
if not by the best background checkers in England,

43:04.070 --> 43:05.487
certainly the most expensive.

43:06.155 --> 43:10.326
- What did they say?
- A personal issue. A man.

43:14.330 --> 43:17.083
Well, then your money was well spent.

43:18.376 --> 43:21.254
- Did they give you his name?
- If so, I chose to forget it.

43:24.966 --> 43:29.929
You do brilliant work for us, Margot,
but remember your job is analysis.

43:30.430 --> 43:33.349
On every project you're the first in, first out.

43:33.432 --> 43:34.474
You stay back at HQ.

43:34.559 --> 43:36.870
Oh, I'm not there for the rougher stuff,
is that what you're saying?

43:36.936 --> 43:39.646
We believe that efficiency generates prosperity.

43:39.730 --> 43:42.566
We lean companies. We cut the fat.
That's what we do.

43:42.942 --> 43:46.362
But we both know that that comes at a human cost.

43:46.445 --> 43:48.740
Sackings. Families out on the pavement.

43:49.031 --> 43:50.907
And that's why The Bridge is important to me.

43:50.992 --> 43:56.289
I like to believe there's a contribution
to the social fabric at the end of all this.

43:56.497 --> 43:58.498
Stirling, why only you?

43:59.125 --> 44:02.545
You're trying to make some moral sense
of what we're doing.

44:02.628 --> 44:04.797
Don't you think the rest of us think about these things?

44:05.255 --> 44:07.341
Yeah, of course you do, I know that.

44:07.425 --> 44:13.555
Look, there are only so many
paper cup companies I can turn around.

44:14.890 --> 44:19.019
If The Bridge is doing something to make a difference,

44:19.102 --> 44:21.272
I'd like to be part of it.

44:30.822 --> 44:33.576
Silly, isn't it?
You work with people, you like them,

44:33.659 --> 44:36.453
and you so easily forget that
they're as complicated as you are.

44:38.456 --> 44:40.666
Yes, you do.

44:42.126 --> 44:44.294
I'll take you through The Bridge tomorrow.

44:44.462 --> 44:45.837
Thank you.

44:47.131 --> 44:49.800
- Dinner?
- Yes, please.

44:52.719 --> 44:54.597
Oh, one more question.

44:54.681 --> 44:58.017
The man at MI5, you're over him, are you?

44:58.852 --> 45:00.185
Oh, yes.

45:01.396 --> 45:02.730
Long over.

45:09.820 --> 45:11.364
There you are.

45:11.446 --> 45:13.616
I was thinking you might be over-worked.

45:13.700 --> 45:15.409
I am over-worked.

45:15.493 --> 45:17.202
Been reading company reports.

45:17.703 --> 45:20.831
I was wondering, perhaps, if you'd
like to take a trip round the island.

45:20.915 --> 45:23.042
This place is rather beyond my pay-grade.

45:23.501 --> 45:26.545
- Do you have a car?
- I have access to a car.

45:29.007 --> 45:31.508
Do you wanna have a swim before we go?

45:33.011 --> 45:35.929
- I don't have any trunks.
- Shame.

45:59.829 --> 46:02.457
If you really wanna know,
Frank was a friend of my father's.

46:02.539 --> 46:04.917
- So was Gary.
- I see.

46:05.752 --> 46:10.339
They only half need me on this trip,
they more brought me here as a reward.

46:10.423 --> 46:13.635
- A reward for what?
- For being a good girl.

46:16.513 --> 46:18.222
- A glass of beer?
- I'd like that.

46:18.306 --> 46:20.100
- Two, please.
- Sure.

46:20.892 --> 46:23.644
What happened the night that Dido was killed?

46:25.146 --> 46:26.189
Why do you ask?

46:26.480 --> 46:28.649
You rang me, remember, you wanted to talk about it.

46:28.816 --> 46:30.734
So I did.

46:30.819 --> 46:34.029
But first tell me why did you come to Turks and Caicos?

46:34.655 --> 46:36.907
Shitty little tax-dodger islands.

46:37.033 --> 46:39.493
I went to an airport in London and took the first flight.

46:39.576 --> 46:41.454
Believe it or not, I'd never even heard of them.

46:41.746 --> 46:44.248
Frank's convinced you're from the Inland Revenue.

46:45.875 --> 46:48.044
I wonder what makes him think that.

46:48.669 --> 46:50.504
Oh, and about what happened that night?

46:50.588 --> 46:52.465
Well, let me tell you.

46:52.548 --> 46:55.175
- Dido was in an obnoxious state.
- I remember.

46:55.260 --> 46:58.513
Oh, it got even more so as the evening went on.

46:58.595 --> 47:02.684
One thing I've noticed about rich people is
they are angry most of the time.

47:02.766 --> 47:05.812
Maybe they're frightened someone's
going to come and take their money away.

47:06.271 --> 47:08.314
Dido was an unusual man.

47:09.149 --> 47:11.026
I'd known him my whole life.

47:11.108 --> 47:13.444
We were sitting there saying, "It's a beautiful night,

47:13.528 --> 47:15.864
"you got a drink in your hand, you just bought a hotel,

47:15.947 --> 47:17.282
"how's life going to get any better than this?"

47:17.364 --> 47:19.868
- He bought the hotel?
- Yeah, sure. They all had.

47:19.950 --> 47:22.619
- The one you're staying at?
- Dido just kept complaining

47:22.704 --> 47:25.164
and sort of staggered off into the distance.

47:25.248 --> 47:26.916
Who with? Who did he go with?

47:30.295 --> 47:33.255
Let's talk about something else, shall we?

47:45.852 --> 47:47.561
You have to eat.

47:48.103 --> 47:50.230
You have to eat something.

47:50.939 --> 47:52.816
Do I?

47:52.901 --> 47:54.819
Why?

48:00.033 --> 48:06.121
Look, these men, they're family friends,
if that's what you're asking.

48:07.373 --> 48:09.166
I grew up in New Jersey.

48:09.249 --> 48:11.670
People coming round, doing deals.

48:11.753 --> 48:16.424
Family business, shaking hands, then disappearing.

48:17.299 --> 48:19.260
There was always a hunt for advantage.

48:21.720 --> 48:23.723
I was always alone.

48:23.806 --> 48:27.352
I was an only child, with only one parent,

48:28.519 --> 48:31.273
in a big gloomy house on a hill.

48:31.564 --> 48:34.566
Just me and my dad rattling around.

48:34.651 --> 48:38.071
- Is your father still alive?
- No, he's dead.

48:43.867 --> 48:46.371
So, I got used to being on my own.

48:49.207 --> 48:50.750
I was pretty.

48:51.709 --> 48:55.547
My father's friends liked to be with me.

48:59.508 --> 49:01.302
Dad liked it, too.

49:06.098 --> 49:07.767
You understand what I'm saying?

49:13.523 --> 49:15.232
Have you talked to anyone about this?

49:20.989 --> 49:22.824
I'm talking to you.

49:26.745 --> 49:29.956
Have you ever known anyone who didn't hurt you?

49:40.800 --> 49:42.969
I need to go to the bathroom.

49:44.637 --> 49:46.306
Too much beer.

50:13.624 --> 50:16.336
-I've upset you, I'm sorry.

50:19.214 --> 50:21.423
No, it's…

50:21.716 --> 50:23.552
It's not your fault.

50:25.052 --> 50:27.264
There's something wrong with me.

50:27.346 --> 50:29.765
There's nothing wrong with you.

50:30.642 --> 50:32.144
No.

50:32.227 --> 50:34.855
Trust me, there is…

50:34.937 --> 50:37.857
There is something deeply wrong with me.

50:39.734 --> 50:43.697
I know more about it than you.
I've lived with it longer.

50:46.241 --> 50:49.827
I won't tell anyone, I promise.

50:53.956 --> 50:55.959
Thank you.

51:02.924 --> 51:04.551
Shall we go for a walk?

51:08.680 --> 51:11.974
- You don't think I'm fooled, do you?
- I'm sorry?

51:13.101 --> 51:15.895
- You and Pelissier.
- Oh.

51:16.353 --> 51:18.731
You don't fool me for a minute.

51:19.315 --> 51:22.860
Is everyone in British Intelligence as charming as you?

51:26.614 --> 51:29.534
I assume you're working with Curtis.

51:31.786 --> 51:34.456
- Well?
- It's not quite as simple as that.

51:34.539 --> 51:36.124
It never is.

51:36.207 --> 51:38.668
But he has asked me to help him, yes.

51:41.420 --> 51:44.716
Help him get something he can't get for himself?

51:50.054 --> 51:52.557
Well, I've made a decision, Tom.

51:53.809 --> 51:56.978
I don't want to spend the rest of my life
in Witness Protection.

51:57.061 --> 51:58.980
I promise you it won't come to that.

52:02.024 --> 52:04.986
Are all your promises made so easily?

52:09.573 --> 52:11.993
Yeah, well, I have an idea.

52:12.077 --> 52:16.038
I have an idea how we might
all get out of this thing alive.

52:16.122 --> 52:19.042
- But there's a problem.
- What's the problem?

52:20.419 --> 52:22.754
You're gonna have to trust me.

52:32.471 --> 52:33.682
You're good at this.

52:33.764 --> 52:38.353
Yeah, it's a simple game.
You just got to be fast and accurate.

52:40.981 --> 52:43.817
And have a talent for display.

52:43.983 --> 52:46.068
You play like that, you're going to get arrested.

52:46.403 --> 52:48.362
Who's gonna arrest me?

53:10.092 --> 53:11.720
Thank you, Tom.

53:12.471 --> 53:14.180
I enjoyed my day.

53:14.972 --> 53:16.975
You're a nice man.

53:17.058 --> 53:19.977
- We'll talk again tomorrow.
- Can't we talk tonight?

53:23.397 --> 53:25.067
You ought to be careful,

53:25.983 --> 53:28.737
'Cos if you're not, these people will kill you.

53:35.452 --> 53:37.579
<i>Six to you, Curtis.</i>

53:40.123 --> 53:41.708
- Hello, baby.
- Hey.

53:41.791 --> 53:44.086
- <i>Hey, Melanie. Nice day?</i>
- <i>I see you.</i>

53:45.252 --> 53:48.589
<i>No, you have got to be kidding me!</i>

53:53.512 --> 53:57.683
<i>I'm happy to show you this,
but bear in mind, it's confidential.</i>

53:58.015 --> 54:00.227
The Bridge is a charitable foundation.

54:00.435 --> 54:03.271
We will file, but we haven't filed yet.
We're not in that position.

54:03.397 --> 54:05.691
I see. Any reason for that?

54:07.067 --> 54:10.404
Money's always happiest when it migrates.

54:11.779 --> 54:13.740
There it is marching across the page.

54:14.825 --> 54:18.911
There's nothing more beautiful,
is there, than money going to work.

54:20.746 --> 54:22.290
- See this?
- <i>Hmm?</i>

54:22.374 --> 54:24.292
- Consulting.
- Consulting?

54:24.375 --> 54:26.795
Exactly. We put it aside.

54:28.839 --> 54:31.216
- It's like a tithe.
- Exactly. It's a tithe.

54:31.340 --> 54:32.551
On everything we do.

54:32.884 --> 54:35.220
Business doesn't interest me, philosophy does.

54:35.344 --> 54:38.807
That's why I have the colloquium.
It's for architects, not plumbers.

54:38.890 --> 54:43.686
It's for people who want to re-design
the system, not just make it work.

54:44.729 --> 54:46.899
You're one of those people?

54:51.904 --> 54:54.530
Come to the colloquium.

54:54.614 --> 54:56.575
Why don't you? We can hang out on the islands.

54:57.326 --> 54:59.535
- Islands?
- Turks and Caicos.

55:01.913 --> 55:03.290
Remind me?

55:03.373 --> 55:08.003
An hour away from Miami by air,
and a universe away in spirit.

55:08.961 --> 55:11.423
Sir, the Prime Minister's waiting.

55:17.762 --> 55:19.305
Don't worry. I'll put it away.

55:32.486 --> 55:34.403
Stirling.

55:34.987 --> 55:36.740
Alec, I'm sorry, I had no idea you were early.

55:36.823 --> 55:39.868
No problem, I love being kept waiting by you.

55:39.951 --> 55:42.787
- So, where are we going to go?
- My shout, wherever you want.

55:42.871 --> 55:45.957
- Do you want Japanese?
- No. There is a good steak house in Hoxton.

55:46.041 --> 55:47.668
<i>You go to all these official dinners,</i>

55:47.750 --> 55:49.670
you never get a decent piece of meat…

56:17.780 --> 56:19.782
- I'd forgotten about this.
- About what?

56:19.866 --> 56:21.659
What fun it is.

56:21.744 --> 56:24.495
The first sheet is like a trap door.

56:25.288 --> 56:27.957
It gets us into the catacomb,
but it doesn't get us through.

56:28.207 --> 56:30.961
10% on everything goes to The Bridge.

56:31.043 --> 56:33.337
Rogers is charging for his services.

56:33.714 --> 56:35.007
- Then…
- Then what?

56:35.299 --> 56:37.258
I don't get it.

56:37.341 --> 56:39.011
"Future projects."

56:43.014 --> 56:45.391
Can you go back? Can you get any more?

56:45.476 --> 56:48.645
I mean, this is good, but it's not good enough.

56:55.068 --> 56:56.987
Did Johnny tell you what happened?

56:59.573 --> 57:02.743
You remember, we were together for a long time.

57:03.409 --> 57:05.495
And we thought we'd be together for the rest of our lives.

57:05.579 --> 57:09.750
- You could put up with the jazz?
- I could put up with everything.

57:09.958 --> 57:11.751
Except being a spy.

57:11.835 --> 57:15.422
I decided two spies wasn't a good idea.

57:15.756 --> 57:18.674
Together. Too many secrets. Too many lies.

57:18.758 --> 57:20.343
It was you who left?

57:29.102 --> 57:31.397
Johnny's promised me.

57:31.479 --> 57:33.774
Whatever happens, he's going to protect you.

57:34.191 --> 57:36.943
How exactly is he going to protect me?

57:37.026 --> 57:39.070
I don't even know where he is.

57:39.320 --> 57:40.990
- Margot?
- Yes?

57:41.948 --> 57:43.533
He's on Turks and Caicos.

57:45.118 --> 57:47.662
Well, I had a feeling he might be.

57:53.876 --> 57:57.715
I have to congratulate you, Rollo.
You've done well.

57:57.839 --> 57:59.550
- <i>Have I?</i>
- Of course.

57:59.632 --> 58:02.218
<i>Not just dragged her back in, you mean,
but ruined her life as well?</i>

58:02.302 --> 58:03.803
<i>Just when she thought she was rid of you.</i>

58:03.886 --> 58:05.888
- She's going to thank you for that.
- <i>Is she?</i>

58:05.972 --> 58:08.183
- <i>Is she really?</i>
- Yeah. In the long run.

58:08.266 --> 58:09.559
What about the other thing?

58:10.185 --> 58:12.771
Yeah, there is a new boss at the CIA.

58:12.855 --> 58:14.731
A new broom, and yes, it's true.

58:14.814 --> 58:17.192
He does want to make a fresh start.
Whatever that means.

58:17.276 --> 58:19.193
And the man who calls himself Curtis Pelissier?

58:19.444 --> 58:23.114
In your description, 6'2", 160 pounds, cultured, striking…

58:23.198 --> 58:25.284
- <i>That's the chap.</i>
- We don't have a match.

58:25.367 --> 58:30.289
I'm sorry. I know you don't want to hear this,
but he could be anyone at all.

58:55.522 --> 58:57.858
<i>Ah, there you are. I've been looking for you.</i>

58:57.942 --> 59:00.693
I'm a man of regular habits, Mr Eliot.

59:00.778 --> 59:02.821
I take coffee here every morning.

59:02.905 --> 59:04.364
Harry, another cup?

59:06.866 --> 59:08.911
So, how may I help?

59:08.993 --> 59:11.287
Oh, I've been wondering how the investigation was going.

59:11.371 --> 59:13.456
Have you? What's your interest?

59:13.541 --> 59:16.418
Well, if you remember, I was briefly a suspect, I believe.

59:16.501 --> 59:18.712
- Hmm. It was done with an oar.
- Really?

59:19.170 --> 59:21.590
Wham! Across the face.

59:22.840 --> 59:26.511
Two people out in a boat,
only one slugged the other with an oar.

59:26.595 --> 59:28.931
- Smashed the cheek.
- Parsons fell in the water?

59:29.013 --> 59:32.643
Are you some kind of professional investigator, Mr Eliot?

59:32.893 --> 59:35.521
I'm a civil servant looking
for somewhere pleasant to retire.

59:35.603 --> 59:37.064
And what's Pelissier?

59:37.146 --> 59:38.690
The lost prince of the Romanovs?

59:39.983 --> 59:42.820
If you want to know, I'd put my money on an angry woman.

59:42.902 --> 59:44.153
Yes? Why?

59:44.654 --> 59:47.782
- It's a crime of passion, isn't it?
- Passion?

59:48.492 --> 59:50.201
If it's a woman, have you got a suspect?

59:50.286 --> 59:52.872
Better than that, we have her passport.

59:53.037 --> 59:55.081
And in 24 hours we'll have her DNA.

59:55.249 --> 59:58.585
You weren't thinking about telling her, were you?

01:00:02.006 --> 01:00:04.799
Do you understand the constitution of these islands?

01:00:04.884 --> 01:00:07.553
Did you know that Turks and Caicos
is a Crown Protectorate?

01:00:07.635 --> 01:00:08.678
I think I do, yes.

01:00:08.762 --> 01:00:12.475
And the currency is American,
but the jurisdiction is British.

01:00:12.557 --> 01:00:16.437
We trade in the dollar and kneel to the crown.

01:00:16.687 --> 01:00:19.273
Yeah, what you might call the worst of both worlds.

01:00:20.148 --> 01:00:23.986
Down at my level, you keep coming across people who think

01:00:24.068 --> 01:00:27.323
- that murder is a minor crime.
- I've noticed that.

01:00:27.405 --> 01:00:30.533
And they don't seem concerned about it at all.

01:00:30.785 --> 01:00:35.456
When the CIA wants something,
the rest of us have to step out of the way.

01:00:36.372 --> 01:00:38.666
Consider yourself fortunate.

01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:41.670
I happen to like you.

01:00:41.753 --> 01:00:43.046
Personally, I mean.

01:00:44.298 --> 01:00:47.176
- Why on earth do you like me?
- Family reasons.

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:49.677
- I like the way you've treated my sister.
- Your sister?

01:00:49.762 --> 01:00:52.306
And you've been good to my nephew.

01:00:53.682 --> 01:00:54.767
Yeah.

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:57.269
Aldous needs a man in his life.

01:00:57.393 --> 01:00:59.939
- He's a good boy. I like him.
- I know you do.

01:01:00.522 --> 01:01:02.440
It's a shame.

01:01:03.483 --> 01:01:06.487
I don't imagine you'll be sticking around.

01:01:41.813 --> 01:01:43.774
- Well, how are you?
- Welcome back, Mr Rogers.

01:01:43.857 --> 01:01:46.234
- Nice to see you again.
- Great to see you, too.

01:01:46.318 --> 01:01:49.070
- This is Margot.
- Hello, how are you?

01:01:49.155 --> 01:01:51.073
Thank you.

01:02:04.837 --> 01:02:06.630
Thank you.

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.387
Like it?

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.057
So, what do you think?

01:02:16.557 --> 01:02:18.142
Wow!

01:02:18.224 --> 01:02:20.894
-I just think, wow, that's what I think.

01:02:27.108 --> 01:02:30.613
Oh, by the way, shout if you need a room of your own.

01:02:42.957 --> 01:02:44.710
Hey, stranger.

01:02:44.793 --> 01:02:47.212
What can I get you? Can I pour you a drink?

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:49.506
It's a little early for me.

01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:52.384
Do you know what I like best?

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.511
I like lying on the bed.

01:02:55.137 --> 01:02:57.597
I can see everyone else's lives.

01:02:58.682 --> 01:03:02.478
So much more fun to watch other peoples', don't you think?

01:03:03.103 --> 01:03:05.897
Anything’s better than living your own.

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:08.651
Melanie, time's come.

01:03:09.859 --> 01:03:11.194
We're going to have to level.

01:03:11.612 --> 01:03:13.698
Yeah, I had an idea we might.

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.074
I had a talk with Pelissier.

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:17.742
<i>Did you?</i>

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:20.328
He told me some of the things
your friends do for a living.

01:03:20.413 --> 01:03:23.082
- Had you already guessed?
- I was in the general area.

01:03:23.249 --> 01:03:26.501
I had them down as foot soldiers in the war on terror.

01:03:31.924 --> 01:03:35.011
No, Tom, they're not foot soldiers.

01:03:38.723 --> 01:03:40.766
They're quartermasters.

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:49.524
You wouldn't know the world was suffering, would you?

01:03:50.817 --> 01:03:54.446
Look at these guys. How do you
think they're doing so well?

01:03:55.072 --> 01:03:56.239
<i>You tell me.</i>

01:03:56.407 --> 01:04:00.994
Gary, Frank, Dido, they did a thousand things.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.872
Some good, some bad.

01:04:02.955 --> 01:04:05.791
According to what was needed at the time.

01:04:05.874 --> 01:04:08.169
Then they saw an opening.

01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:12.964
Not so much a coalition of the willing,
more a coalition of the billing.

01:04:14.425 --> 01:04:17.177
- Frank and Gary build detention camps.
- Yes.

01:04:19.013 --> 01:04:20.848
Among other things.

01:04:24.684 --> 01:04:27.062
Give me a cigarette, would you?

01:04:30.775 --> 01:04:32.902
<i>Senator, welcome.</i>

01:04:39.074 --> 01:04:43.621
Prisons, cages, fences, watchtowers,

01:04:43.703 --> 01:04:46.457
electronics, security systems.

01:04:46.623 --> 01:04:50.920
The camps had to be built
and nobody had to know it was happening.

01:04:51.002 --> 01:04:53.296
Do you have any idea of the scale of the thing?

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:55.591
Yes. I think I do.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.135
Think about it, you got camps
sprouting up all over the world.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:04.434
It was a growth business like no other.
And the best part, there ain't any rate.

01:05:04.516 --> 01:05:07.854
How much do you charge for building a detention camp?

01:05:07.936 --> 01:05:10.231
Not as much as you charge for keeping quiet

01:05:10.313 --> 01:05:12.567
about building a detention camp.

01:05:12.649 --> 01:05:16.278
The boys, they just took what they liked.

01:05:18.155 --> 01:05:20.448
But now everyone's starting to ask questions.

01:05:20.533 --> 01:05:23.786
So, everyone's rushing to get their money re-invested.

01:05:24.036 --> 01:05:26.038
Re-invested how?

01:05:27.665 --> 01:05:29.959
- Look around.
- This place?

01:05:30.752 --> 01:05:33.880
Exactly. It's laundry.

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.507
It's good, isn't it?

01:05:37.716 --> 01:05:39.677
You could say, it's perfect.

01:05:40.344 --> 01:05:43.222
Selling off those places, buying up these.

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:45.641
Prisons for the poor, prisons for the rich.

01:05:45.974 --> 01:05:48.643
And that's how the world goes round.

01:05:50.437 --> 01:05:53.023
Curtis is looking for proof, isn't he?

01:05:53.106 --> 01:05:56.485
- Proof America's been swindled.
- Yes. That's what he wants.

01:05:56.861 --> 01:05:58.779
Yeah, well, tell him if he wants it, I got it.

01:05:58.863 --> 01:06:00.698
Or rather I know someone who does.

01:06:00.782 --> 01:06:02.699
- It has to be on paper.
- Oh, it's on paper.

01:06:02.784 --> 01:06:04.077
Good.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.245
Tell him the person he needs is flying in today.

01:06:06.328 --> 01:06:08.205
Today?

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:14.961
I told you, I've been planning this thing a long time.

01:06:25.973 --> 01:06:29.352
<i>Can you close the blinds? I'm sleepy.</i>

01:06:45.951 --> 01:06:48.663
- Melanie?
- Yes?

01:06:50.331 --> 01:06:51.874
There's an Englishman, isn't there?

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:54.000
An Englishman?

01:06:54.752 --> 01:06:56.295
Is that who you're after?

01:06:56.504 --> 01:06:58.463
Not the Englishman.

01:07:00.507 --> 01:07:02.552
The Englishman's friend.

01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:15.565
How long we're going to sit here?

01:07:16.982 --> 01:07:18.735
Until she arrives.

01:07:22.988 --> 01:07:25.324
How are we going to know her?

01:07:25.992 --> 01:07:27.577
Ah.

01:07:28.493 --> 01:07:30.329
Ah, I'm glad to see you.

01:07:30.705 --> 01:07:33.291
- Have you had a good flight?
- Couldn't have been better.

01:07:33.373 --> 01:07:36.169
- Melanie sends her best.
- Well, I should hope so.

01:07:36.711 --> 01:07:38.420
This is Curtis Pelissier.

01:07:38.504 --> 01:07:41.299
Curtis. Meet Clare Clovis. Clare’s an accountant.

01:07:42.175 --> 01:07:43.384
<i>Is that all you've got?</i>

01:07:43.468 --> 01:07:46.346
Well, what else should I have?
I'm not planning on staying long.

01:07:47.971 --> 01:07:50.767
Curtis is the man you'll actually be dealing with.

01:07:51.225 --> 01:07:53.226
- He's the money?
- You're right.

01:07:53.311 --> 01:07:56.689
- Well, then, who are you?
- Oh, you know. Home help.

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:00.401
<i>How many copies are we going to need?</i>

01:08:00.484 --> 01:08:02.237
I think we all need our own, don't we?

01:08:02.319 --> 01:08:04.239
- Does that mean three?
- I think it does.

01:08:04.322 --> 01:08:06.198
Oh, and one for safe-keeping.

01:08:06.281 --> 01:08:08.575
Where's safe on this island?

01:08:14.831 --> 01:08:19.420
Good. We put the figures in here,
and now they're safe.

01:08:21.506 --> 01:08:23.256
You'll lock?

01:08:23.423 --> 01:08:24.966
When do I get my three?

01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:28.345
You get three million each, you and Melanie,

01:08:28.428 --> 01:08:30.598
just as soon as the deal goes through.

01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:33.308
Well, then, why do I need to stay for the meeting?

01:08:33.392 --> 01:08:36.395
- Because they need to see you.
- They need to know what I've done?

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:37.854
They'll know that already.

01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:40.859
But they'll need to know
you're not going to change your mind.

01:08:43.318 --> 01:08:45.238
Do you trust this man?

01:08:47.406 --> 01:08:49.575
I'll tell you in 24 hours.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.709
Hello. I'm picking up accreditation,
my name is Tom Eliot.

01:08:57.792 --> 01:08:59.627
I'm a guest of Mr Pelissier.

01:08:59.751 --> 01:09:02.171
Of course, Mr Eliot, it's here.

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:05.924
- Thank you.
- Come this way, please.

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:08.469
Good grief, look at you!

01:09:08.551 --> 01:09:11.721
Well, you've never seen me at work.
This is how I am.

01:09:11.889 --> 01:09:14.475
- It's an act.
- It's very convincing.

01:09:14.558 --> 01:09:17.562
Well, it should be.
It took me my whole life to get it down.

01:09:18.478 --> 01:09:20.314
Let's go outside and share a cigarette.

01:09:20.398 --> 01:09:21.774
- Hmm?
- Sure.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:26.988
- Do you have my tickets and my money?
- Yes, I do.

01:09:29.406 --> 01:09:32.410
Did you take a look to see where I was going?

01:09:32.993 --> 01:09:35.412
As a matter of fact, I did.

01:09:46.673 --> 01:09:49.468
Is there even the shadow
of a chance I might see you there?

01:09:52.345 --> 01:09:54.681
I need to ask you a question.

01:09:55.265 --> 01:09:57.143
Did you kill Dido?

01:09:57.936 --> 01:10:01.730
Either they did or you did
and I don't want to believe it was you.

01:10:06.693 --> 01:10:09.739
Well, it would take some nerve, wouldn't it?

01:10:11.156 --> 01:10:15.494
Kill a man and then call you up
the next morning and joke about it?

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:18.039
What sort of person does that?

01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:21.918
What sort of person?

01:10:24.838 --> 01:10:27.424
We had a nice day, didn't we, Tom?

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:30.717
It was a nice day.

01:10:31.803 --> 01:10:35.889
Drinking beer by the beach, shooting pool.

01:10:38.809 --> 01:10:40.645
It was a nice time.

01:10:43.523 --> 01:10:47.026
We're not going to see each other again, are we?

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:49.153
After this thing blows.

01:10:50.822 --> 01:10:52.741
I don't think so, no.

01:10:57.662 --> 01:11:01.123
- So, can I ask you a favour?
- Of course, what is it?

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:05.503
Will you tell me your name?

01:11:08.339 --> 01:11:09.966
It's Johnny Worricker.

01:11:13.261 --> 01:11:15.180
Nice.

01:11:29.736 --> 01:11:32.364
<i>A warm welcome to this beautiful island.</i>

01:11:32.864 --> 01:11:36.367
As we all know, this could hardly be
a more threatening moment.

01:11:36.451 --> 01:11:38.369
We meet at a dangerous time

01:11:38.452 --> 01:11:41.748
when a setback in the financial markets has been

01:11:41.955 --> 01:11:46.586
misrepresented as a crisis
in the engine room of capitalism itself.

01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:49.838
We all remember how quickly the Berlin Wall came down.

01:11:49.922 --> 01:11:51.591
It vanished, as if it had never been.

01:11:51.758 --> 01:11:53.718
Well, our system is much more robust.

01:11:53.802 --> 01:11:55.971
So, let's all gather round the bed,

01:11:56.053 --> 01:11:59.139
plug in the IV, turn on the monitor,

01:11:59.223 --> 01:12:02.393
and try to bring this ailing patient back to life.

01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:05.855
Thank you.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:12.236
Well, goodness me, isn't life full of surprises?

01:12:13.613 --> 01:12:16.157
You probably don't remember me, my name's Margot Tyrell.

01:12:16.241 --> 01:12:18.033
Miss Tyrell, haven't we met before?

01:12:18.117 --> 01:12:20.328
Do you know, I believe we have.

01:12:20.412 --> 01:12:23.288
- I used to work in the security services.
- Well, snap.

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:24.873
How did you get here?

01:12:24.958 --> 01:12:26.375
I flew. Private plane.

01:12:26.458 --> 01:12:27.544
- Did you?
- Mmm.

01:12:27.627 --> 01:12:30.087
And how are you planning to get back exactly?

01:12:32.089 --> 01:12:33.757
Good question.

01:12:33.842 --> 01:12:35.010
I work for Stirling Rogers.

01:12:35.092 --> 01:12:36.928
He's a man I'd very much like to meet.

01:12:37.012 --> 01:12:39.097
Well, I'm sure that can be arranged.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.932
After all, isn't that what the colloquium
is about? Making contacts?

01:12:42.016 --> 01:12:44.101
Exchanging ideas? This is for you.

01:12:44.394 --> 01:12:46.770
- Why don't I call him over?
- Why don't you do that?

01:12:49.857 --> 01:12:51.317
- Stirling.
- Yeah.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.654
Er, there's somebody here who wants to meet you.

01:12:58.491 --> 01:13:00.284
We have an acquaintance in common.

01:13:00.368 --> 01:13:01.411
Say who.

01:13:01.494 --> 01:13:03.954
Not to name-drop, but the Prime Minister's always

01:13:04.039 --> 01:13:06.415
taken a personal interest in my well-being.

01:13:06.791 --> 01:13:09.920
Well, I'm sure he has.
Alec’s a very close friend of mine.

01:13:10.003 --> 01:13:15.217
So I've heard. Why don't you and I
get together to catch up at cocktail hour?

01:13:15.299 --> 01:13:17.177
- I missed your name.
- I didn’t give it.

01:13:18.469 --> 01:13:20.388
I'm afraid 6:00, I can't. I'm busy.

01:13:20.471 --> 01:13:22.640
Frank and Gary are coming.

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:26.144
- Frank?
- Yeah. And Gary.

01:13:26.352 --> 01:13:30.732
I've also invited a friend
from the American Intelligence community.

01:13:32.734 --> 01:13:34.652
Well, why don't I try and make myself free?

01:13:34.861 --> 01:13:37.989
Yeah. Why don't you?

01:13:39.406 --> 01:13:40.742
Mr Rogers.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.333
I have a deposit box, name of Eliot.

01:13:49.124 --> 01:13:50.961
Please step through.

01:13:54.673 --> 01:13:56.716
Good morning, Mr Eliot.

01:14:11.689 --> 01:14:14.442
Hey, Tony. How are you doing?

01:14:16.277 --> 01:14:18.946
- Here.
- So beautiful.

01:14:21.115 --> 01:14:22.575
Sorry to drop in.

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:25.537
I was hoping you might be able
to take care of some stuff for me.

01:14:25.619 --> 01:14:28.498
- What is it?
- All my earthly possessions.

01:14:29.749 --> 01:14:31.334
OK.

01:14:35.546 --> 01:14:37.214
Paintings mostly.

01:14:37.507 --> 01:14:38.883
Also some cash.

01:14:38.967 --> 01:14:40.217
You're leaving me cash?

01:14:40.677 --> 01:14:43.387
Just for now. I am hoping to be back by midnight,

01:14:43.471 --> 01:14:45.473
but it's possible I may have to make a run for it.

01:14:45.556 --> 01:14:48.225
If I do, the stuff is yours.

01:14:48.559 --> 01:14:49.853
How am I going to know?

01:14:51.438 --> 01:14:53.648
The clue is, I won't be here.

01:14:55.441 --> 01:14:57.903
Also, I brought one of these.

01:14:57.985 --> 01:15:00.280
It's for Aldous, now that he's got the hang of them.

01:15:00.405 --> 01:15:02.574
- Is he around?
- He's at a friend's house.

01:15:04.283 --> 01:15:06.410
Hand him the spiny thing.

01:15:07.621 --> 01:15:09.538
And um…

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:13.877
Tell him from me he's a wonderful boy.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.669
What, and give him a big head?

01:15:16.505 --> 01:15:18.380
Risk it.

01:15:24.011 --> 01:15:25.721
You in trouble?

01:15:28.058 --> 01:15:30.769
You thought this was a nice little island, didn't you?

01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:35.147
That was your fault.
I thought they were all like you.

01:15:36.817 --> 01:15:38.234
Get out of here.

01:15:39.318 --> 01:15:41.821
Oh, I meant to say…

01:15:43.073 --> 01:15:46.410
There's a woman. She may arrive.
She's got your address.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:51.122
Do you think you could possibly take her in?

01:16:18.441 --> 01:16:20.235
Margot.

01:16:20.317 --> 01:16:21.944
Are you alone?

01:16:33.873 --> 01:16:36.500
- You look rested. Did you get some sleep?
- I did.

01:16:36.584 --> 01:16:39.004
- Are you ready?
- More than ready.

01:16:41.048 --> 01:16:45.218
- Good evening. I trust you're both rested.
- <i>We are.</i>

01:16:45.302 --> 01:16:46.803
I took a short sleep myself.

01:16:46.887 --> 01:16:52.517
So, whatever happens, remember, stick to the script.

01:16:59.607 --> 01:17:01.401
Oh, gentlemen.

01:17:03.445 --> 01:17:06.156
I see sour expressions all around.

01:17:06.573 --> 01:17:08.659
- I knew it would be you.
- It had to be me.

01:17:08.742 --> 01:17:10.910
After all, I'm the only one who knows the facts.

01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:12.704
Do you? Do you really?

01:17:12.788 --> 01:17:14.580
Why don't we all sit down?

01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:16.083
Curtis Pelissier.

01:17:16.165 --> 01:17:17.875
Stirling Rogers.

01:17:18.292 --> 01:17:19.877
- Hello.
- Margot Tyrell.

01:17:19.961 --> 01:17:21.588
Pleasure.

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:27.718
The boys don't want to tell you,
but they're not very happy.

01:17:27.844 --> 01:17:30.346
- You got that right.
- Is that orange juice fresh?

01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:31.931
They took a beating at cards.

01:17:32.015 --> 01:17:34.976
- It's fresh.
- I made $10,000 the other night.

01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:37.520
And now, we're going to play for higher stakes.

01:17:37.603 --> 01:17:41.608
Let's cut the crap, Pelissier.
You're not as smart as you think you are.

01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:45.528
You've had CIA written all over you
from the day you arrived.

01:17:45.612 --> 01:17:47.698
I don't know whether to be flattered.

01:17:47.823 --> 01:17:50.993
And your sidekick is some kind of fairy English cop.

01:17:51.075 --> 01:17:52.327
Close.

01:17:52.411 --> 01:17:53.703
<i>Yeah, well, you're not gonna be so happy</i>

01:17:53.786 --> 01:17:55.413
when you hear the next piece of news.

01:17:55.497 --> 01:17:57.207
- Go ahead.
- You've underestimated us.

01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:59.083
We've spoken to your boss.

01:17:59.167 --> 01:18:01.295
We know him. We know him extremely well.

01:18:01.378 --> 01:18:03.087
We've worked closely together in the past.

01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:04.213
- Have you?
- Yes.

01:18:04.297 --> 01:18:05.840
I don't see it makes much difference.

01:18:05.924 --> 01:18:08.759
Whatever happens, you're still going to have to pay.

01:18:09.595 --> 01:18:10.679
Be-definitely.

01:18:10.762 --> 01:18:13.724
You know as well as we do the CIA's split down the middle.

01:18:13.807 --> 01:18:16.518
Half the people that work there
approve of this stuff, half don't.

01:18:16.601 --> 01:18:18.520
You're going to have to tell me what "this stuff" is.

01:18:18.645 --> 01:18:22.023
I'm guessing detention without trial, torture, rendition.

01:18:22.107 --> 01:18:24.193
Gladstone builds the camps.

01:18:24.318 --> 01:18:26.278
It's not our business what goes on in them.

01:18:26.361 --> 01:18:28.947
No, but it is mine.

01:18:29.364 --> 01:18:32.450
- <i>If I can just say a word.</i>
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

01:18:32.534 --> 01:18:36.288
- Curtis asked me to take a look at the figures.
- What figures are those?

01:18:36.371 --> 01:18:39.707
As provided by Miss Clovis here
who works as your accountant.

01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:41.626
Or did until yesterday.

01:18:41.877 --> 01:18:43.420
<i>We've made an arrangement.</i>

01:18:43.545 --> 01:18:46.131
These figures are being sent all over the world…

01:18:46.297 --> 01:18:49.885
Newspapers, television stations, in half an hour

01:18:49.967 --> 01:18:51.470
unless you make your payment.

01:18:52.178 --> 01:18:55.432
The practical details of how to effect
the payment are on the other sheet.

01:18:55.599 --> 01:18:58.351
Go ahead. Publish. What do we care?

01:18:59.352 --> 01:19:02.146
You think people are shocked by this kind of thing?

01:19:02.231 --> 01:19:03.857
As a matter of fact, I do, yes.

01:19:03.941 --> 01:19:05.066
It happens all the time.

01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:07.611
<i>High prices?</i>
Since when is that an indictable offence?

01:19:07.777 --> 01:19:10.614
If overcharging were a crime,
the whole world would be behind bars.

01:19:10.697 --> 01:19:14.952
I've timed my computer,
they'll go off automatically unless I stop it.

01:19:16.954 --> 01:19:18.788
I don't believe it.

01:19:19.372 --> 01:19:23.000
- I don't believe a fucking word!
- Whoa. Whoa.

01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:25.671
Let's just keep it civilised, please.

01:19:26.003 --> 01:19:28.172
Gary, sit down.

01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:37.932
After all, isn't that your interest?
Civilisation and its values?

01:19:38.015 --> 01:19:40.017
Isn't that what the colloquium’s about?

01:19:40.101 --> 01:19:42.020
I swear I'm going to deck this guy.

01:19:42.145 --> 01:19:46.150
I wouldn’t advise it.
There's been one murder already.

01:19:46.733 --> 01:19:48.943
And, what's more, we all know who did it.

01:19:50.486 --> 01:19:53.573
Something to do with Dido's sense of ownership.

01:19:55.951 --> 01:19:59.370
She hit him in the face with an oar.
Fair enough, I don't blame her.

01:19:59.454 --> 01:20:02.791
After a lifetime of abuse, we're all tired of old men

01:20:02.875 --> 01:20:04.835
who think they're entitled.

01:20:05.042 --> 01:20:07.588
- How do you know?
- Because she told me.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.381
<i>No.</i>

01:20:11.258 --> 01:20:14.762
- She wouldn't say that to anyone.
- She said it to me.

01:20:17.221 --> 01:20:22.268
That really is something you don't want to see
played out in public, isn't it?

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:24.854
Do you want the details in court?

01:20:30.402 --> 01:20:32.488
I heard there was a name.

01:20:34.447 --> 01:20:36.658
A sort of joke name.

01:20:36.742 --> 01:20:38.451
Only the joke isn't funny.

01:20:39.952 --> 01:20:42.580
You called yourselves The Syndicate.

01:20:49.504 --> 01:20:51.631
Melanie won't go to court.

01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:55.176
You see, if you take a look at the figures…

01:20:55.259 --> 01:20:57.678
We know the figures.

01:20:57.762 --> 01:21:00.515
Gladstone provided a ton of wiring and metal cages

01:21:00.599 --> 01:21:04.395
worth 50 million bucks, and charged 500 million.

01:21:04.477 --> 01:21:07.772
Use the words "national security"
and you could get away with anything.

01:21:07.982 --> 01:21:11.317
Times are changing. It's a recession.

01:21:11.401 --> 01:21:13.945
- We want 200 back.
- That's fair.

01:21:14.445 --> 01:21:16.740
How are we supposed to get our hands on 200 million?

01:21:16.824 --> 01:21:20.284
It's in one of your accounts.
Right now. I know which one.

01:21:20.452 --> 01:21:22.203
I'm the accountant, remember?

01:21:22.412 --> 01:21:26.582
You still get out with a good profit
and no criminal convictions.

01:21:26.667 --> 01:21:28.960
- No. We're not buying.
- You have to buy.

01:21:29.043 --> 01:21:30.337
Melanie looks after herself.

01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:34.550
And as for the rest of it, we'll tough it out.
Your word against ours.

01:21:34.633 --> 01:21:36.342
Truly, I wouldn’t recommend it.

01:21:36.426 --> 01:21:39.138
Going to war with the company is never a good idea.

01:21:39.221 --> 01:21:40.931
We'll take our chances.

01:21:48.022 --> 01:21:52.860
Oh, goodness, I'd almost forgotten,
there is something else.

01:21:54.236 --> 01:21:55.946
I forgot to tell you, Curtis,

01:21:56.030 --> 01:22:02.202
I do have another document from another source.

01:22:03.077 --> 01:22:04.954
Uh, Escrow.

01:22:05.496 --> 01:22:07.206
- I'm sorry?
- Is that the word?

01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:08.708
An Escrow account?

01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:12.504
I mean, I had to take advice on what exactly that means.

01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:16.507
Did he get this from you?

01:22:18.593 --> 01:22:21.137
Margot, did he get this from you?

01:22:22.514 --> 01:22:26.143
Doesn't it mean the money just sits there
and nobody can touch it?

01:22:26.227 --> 01:22:27.352
That's what it means.

01:22:27.435 --> 01:22:29.062
Until someone needs it.

01:22:29.271 --> 01:22:31.648
And when, I wonder, is that going to be?

01:22:32.106 --> 01:22:33.191
Please explain.

01:22:33.442 --> 01:22:36.195
You see, Curtis, we live in a rapidly changing world.

01:22:36.277 --> 01:22:40.324
Downing Street used to be the height of a man's ambition,

01:22:40.406 --> 01:22:44.286
but now it seems to be only a stepping stone.

01:22:44.577 --> 01:22:48.541
I don't think the Prime Minister
has any urgent plans to stand down.

01:22:48.666 --> 01:22:50.167
If that's who you're talking about.

01:22:50.291 --> 01:22:53.962
Ah, but it's not me going to decide, is it?
Or you, Mr Rogers.

01:22:54.045 --> 01:22:58.258
No, that's the one last decision
that still lies with the British electorate.

01:22:58.675 --> 01:23:00.718
If you're going to make allegations against Alec Beasley,

01:23:00.802 --> 01:23:02.804
then I suggest you make them privately.

01:23:03.055 --> 01:23:05.391
Why? Are you recording this?

01:23:05.473 --> 01:23:06.558
No. Are you?

01:23:06.641 --> 01:23:10.604
Last time I saw my recorder, I swear to God,
it was sitting in an ice-box. Where's yours?

01:23:11.981 --> 01:23:13.398
It's perfectly clear.

01:23:14.733 --> 01:23:19.028
The so-called Bridge is partly a holding account.

01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:22.408
- So what?
- In the name of Stirling Rogers.

01:23:23.741 --> 01:23:26.494
But there's another partner, isn't there?

01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:29.539
Call him a sleeping partner.

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.501
You'd better be careful.

01:23:33.710 --> 01:23:35.546
Oh, I forgot.

01:23:36.337 --> 01:23:39.091
Alec Beasley isn't a politician.

01:23:40.259 --> 01:23:42.135
He's a statesman.

01:23:43.429 --> 01:23:45.514
Quite right.

01:23:45.597 --> 01:23:48.892
An altogether more profitable line of work.

01:23:48.976 --> 01:23:53.438
After all, he's going to have to
do something after he leaves office.

01:23:54.063 --> 01:23:59.069
Is there any territorial dispute
in the world he's not qualified to settle

01:23:59.152 --> 01:24:03.741
for a large salary from the luxury
of a suite in a five-star hotel?

01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:08.370
Lucky, isn't it, that he has a fund,

01:24:09.162 --> 01:24:12.665
waiting for his global good works?

01:24:14.627 --> 01:24:17.003
<i>I said no politicians.</i>

01:24:17.671 --> 01:24:20.173
Why get politicians involved?

01:24:23.344 --> 01:24:26.680
The profiteering from building
the camps is going to finance

01:24:26.763 --> 01:24:28.599
the Prime Minister's future career.

01:24:28.682 --> 01:24:30.684
It's as simple as that.

01:24:32.101 --> 01:24:34.187
It's in black and white.

01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:37.315
On the table in front of you.

01:24:40.985 --> 01:24:43.781
It's him, isn't it? That's who it is.

01:24:44.697 --> 01:24:46.241
The man you told me about.

01:24:48.118 --> 01:24:49.369
The man you loved.

01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:56.126
Forgive me, Stirling.

01:24:59.129 --> 01:25:00.464
You'll find me in our room.

01:25:03.883 --> 01:25:05.094
<i>We need to get out.</i>

01:25:06.721 --> 01:25:08.555
We need to get out of this.

01:25:14.352 --> 01:25:16.312
It's strange, isn't it?

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.482
People want the world to change, but they don't think

01:25:19.566 --> 01:25:22.152
about providing the means to do it.

01:25:22.694 --> 01:25:25.448
Money flows, that's what it does.
Who cares where it comes from?

01:25:25.531 --> 01:25:27.824
The question is…

01:25:27.907 --> 01:25:30.077
Where it goes.

01:25:30.161 --> 01:25:34.080
That's why we have islands like this.
They're safety valves.

01:25:34.373 --> 01:25:36.207
Yeah.

01:25:36.291 --> 01:25:38.669
Or sewage farms.

01:25:38.752 --> 01:25:40.420
The rest of the world is struggling along,

01:25:40.504 --> 01:25:43.174
and for some reason you guys think
you can cut yourselves off.

01:25:43.257 --> 01:25:44.759
Who declared you immune?

01:25:48.387 --> 01:25:50.847
- Two hundred, did you say?
- Yeah, 200.

01:25:51.098 --> 01:25:54.392
Let's be clear. The money is paid
and we never hear of this business again.

01:25:54.476 --> 01:25:57.313
Good decision. I was told that you were decisive.

01:25:58.146 --> 01:25:59.357
Do you own the police?

01:26:00.106 --> 01:26:02.568
I wouldn't say we own them. They're British.

01:26:02.652 --> 01:26:04.570
Well, then you own them.

01:26:04.695 --> 01:26:07.698
Can you fix them? Can you fix them?

01:26:09.157 --> 01:26:12.495
Then Melanie leaves the island tomorrow. No charges.

01:26:12.744 --> 01:26:14.080
- Agreed.
- And our passports?

01:26:14.245 --> 01:26:16.873
- Thrown in.
- Returned as soon as the money is paid?

01:26:16.956 --> 01:26:18.042
In your hands.

01:26:22.755 --> 01:26:24.673
Is it a deal?

01:26:26.008 --> 01:26:29.053
Well done. Successful operation.

01:26:29.512 --> 01:26:31.388
The money's gone through.

01:26:31.471 --> 01:26:35.309
Better still, your friend Melanie's killed one of them,

01:26:35.393 --> 01:26:38.938
she can kill the other two as far as I'm concerned.

01:26:39.021 --> 01:26:42.149
Clare, if you go to my room, I'll join you.

01:26:42.233 --> 01:26:44.567
- I'll give you cash.
- Really?

01:26:44.652 --> 01:26:46.362
Really. Trust me.

01:26:52.284 --> 01:26:54.704
<i>So, I guess I have to thank you.</i>

01:26:54.995 --> 01:26:59.165
You pulled a trick in there.
You're as good as they say you are.

01:27:03.588 --> 01:27:05.089
Am I good?

01:27:07.424 --> 01:27:11.636
- We got what we wanted.
- Yeah. You did. I won't.

01:27:13.805 --> 01:27:15.890
It's a shame really, Curtis, you're such a low-life.

01:27:15.975 --> 01:27:18.810
Given that you do have a certain lizard charm.

01:27:18.893 --> 01:27:19.978
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:27:20.061 --> 01:27:21.314
- Don't you?
- No.

01:27:21.563 --> 01:27:23.189
Then what's that thug doing over there?

01:27:23.274 --> 01:27:25.818
He was there when we went in.
He's following us now.

01:27:26.234 --> 01:27:30.280
Yeah, even a fairy cop knows when he's being sold out.

01:27:33.868 --> 01:27:35.577
Look, old man,

01:27:35.786 --> 01:27:38.830
- I'm sorry about this, really I am.
- I'm sure you are.

01:27:38.915 --> 01:27:40.625
You can't imagine the pressure I've been under.

01:27:40.707 --> 01:27:42.918
- Oh, I think I can.
- I've never known anything like it.

01:27:43.001 --> 01:27:45.129
I always knew you weren't a rogue.

01:27:45.296 --> 01:27:48.883
You don't think like a rogue.
You think like a company man.

01:27:48.966 --> 01:27:51.134
London's desperate. They want you back.

01:27:51.218 --> 01:27:53.513
They were insisting. They want you badly.

01:27:53.596 --> 01:27:57.099
You made a promise. You promised me!

01:27:57.225 --> 01:27:59.393
Johnny, you know how it works.

01:27:59.476 --> 01:28:02.812
One day, I'm going to need a favour from MI5.

01:28:02.897 --> 01:28:04.856
- I bet you will.
- I'm going to need it.

01:28:05.107 --> 01:28:07.735
Do you think I'll get my favour if I let you go?

01:28:07.817 --> 01:28:11.364
Johnny, you know what happens to whistle-blowers.

01:28:11.446 --> 01:28:15.242
They turn into lonely old men with bad breath…

01:28:16.536 --> 01:28:17.954
And computers.

01:28:19.205 --> 01:28:21.332
- I'm going to go.
- You don't have a chance at the airport.

01:28:21.414 --> 01:28:22.958
- I know that.
- They're waiting for you.

01:28:23.083 --> 01:28:26.753
I'll meet you at Chico's. Buy me a whisky.
I'll be there in half an hour.

01:28:27.128 --> 01:28:29.214
And this time, I'll drink.

01:28:30.841 --> 01:28:33.219
But I have to say one goodbye.

01:28:35.388 --> 01:28:37.306
He goes where you go.

01:28:38.723 --> 01:28:40.101
Huh?

01:28:42.769 --> 01:28:44.564
Fine.

01:29:22.559 --> 01:29:24.102
I wanted to bring you some flowers.

01:29:24.395 --> 01:29:26.856
Thank you. That's kind.

01:29:27.105 --> 01:29:30.192
It's just things that grow by the seashore.

01:29:32.195 --> 01:29:35.030
The island's interesting for its flora and fauna.

01:29:35.572 --> 01:29:37.784
- I'd like to see it.
- Yes.

01:29:39.201 --> 01:29:40.953
I'd like that, too.

01:29:53.383 --> 01:29:55.926
<i>What did Rogers say?</i>

01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:59.847
Oh, he didn't say anything.
I climbed out the bathroom window.

01:30:01.473 --> 01:30:03.642
That was very…

01:30:03.725 --> 01:30:05.811
- Grown-up of you.
- Yeah. Wasn't it?

01:30:09.691 --> 01:30:12.652
It was clever of you to connect Rogers with Beasley.

01:30:12.735 --> 01:30:14.821
It was clever of you, too.

01:30:16.406 --> 01:30:17.739
How did you do that?

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:21.661
Oh, I had help. You?

01:30:22.411 --> 01:30:25.164
Oh, I had help, too.

01:30:26.791 --> 01:30:30.252
I knew Stirling would leap to defend his friend Beasley.

01:30:30.545 --> 01:30:33.172
- He seemed to trust you completely.
- You're right.

01:30:33.338 --> 01:30:35.091
What was the reason for that?

01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:39.971
All right, you don't have to tell me.

01:30:40.053 --> 01:30:41.848
Why? Would you rather not know?

01:30:44.349 --> 01:30:47.436
That reassures me. I'm pleased.

01:30:47.519 --> 01:30:50.522
After all, it means you can still be hurt.

01:30:53.734 --> 01:30:55.528
Oh, I can be hurt.

01:30:59.906 --> 01:31:03.035
<i>Good evening, sir.</i>
You're on private property.

01:31:04.161 --> 01:31:06.330
You're going to have to show me your papers.

01:31:06.414 --> 01:31:09.291
- That's not a problem.
- At the station.

01:31:09.374 --> 01:31:11.543
I can't come to the station now.

01:31:11.628 --> 01:31:14.213
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

01:31:32.649 --> 01:31:34.816
Listen…

01:31:36.401 --> 01:31:38.487
One way or another, I've got bad news.

01:31:38.821 --> 01:31:40.530
Well, you wouldn't be Johnny if you didn't.

01:31:40.782 --> 01:31:43.825
I don't think we'll be able to stay on the island.

01:31:45.078 --> 01:31:46.286
How long have we got?

01:31:47.038 --> 01:31:49.791
Maybe three minutes.

01:31:51.251 --> 01:31:53.336
Because you're English, they don't actually kill you,

01:31:53.419 --> 01:31:55.170
but they do make your life unlivable.

01:31:55.337 --> 01:31:57.173
- Can I just say something?
- <i>Of course.</i>

01:31:57.255 --> 01:31:59.133
- Just so we're clear?
- Please.

01:31:59.967 --> 01:32:02.679
I didn't give up everything because of you.

01:32:04.889 --> 01:32:06.265
I know what this is about.

01:32:06.975 --> 01:32:09.393
It's about British collusion in torture, isn't it?

01:32:09.851 --> 01:32:12.980
- Partly.
- And the corruption of intelligence.

01:32:13.731 --> 01:32:15.817
It's about all the lies of the last 10 years.

01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:17.192
- It's about the lying.
- Yes.

01:32:17.277 --> 01:32:20.530
- I am against torture.
- So am I.

01:32:21.072 --> 01:32:23.907
And I'm against it being covered up.

01:32:23.991 --> 01:32:26.160
So, anything I choose to do isn't just because of you,

01:32:26.244 --> 01:32:29.372
it's also because it's time it was done.

01:32:37.797 --> 01:32:40.090
We're going to have to go on the run.

01:32:40.173 --> 01:32:41.508
Looks like it.

01:32:41.592 --> 01:32:44.678
- We both know what that means.
- We do.

01:32:44.888 --> 01:32:47.806
Hand to mouth is putting it mildly.

01:32:47.890 --> 01:32:50.392
One day to the next, never being secure.

01:32:50.475 --> 01:32:54.021
Margot, I've seen the price people pay.

01:32:55.814 --> 01:32:57.691
We'll pay that price.

01:33:00.778 --> 01:33:04.072
An awful lot of things went wrong,
didn't they? Between us?

01:33:06.868 --> 01:33:08.912
They certainly did.

01:33:11.664 --> 01:33:14.958
This time it's going to be different. I promise.

01:33:15.042 --> 01:33:18.754
I'm going to give you no reason to leave.

01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:20.882
None whatsoever.

01:33:24.552 --> 01:33:26.470
I'll hold you to that.

01:33:35.688 --> 01:33:39.109
- Do we have too much luggage?
- No.

01:33:40.567 --> 01:33:42.528
There's two of us now.

01:33:45.031 --> 01:33:49.451
<i>This is the final call for JetBlue flight 856.</i>

01:33:49.827 --> 01:33:51.036
That's us.

01:34:59.813 --> 01:35:03.317
- Well, what do you think?
- Give him a few minutes.

01:35:04.401 --> 01:35:06.863
- Are you sure?
- Sure. He'll come.

01:35:07.364 --> 01:35:09.449
Face it, it's an island.

01:35:10.282 --> 01:35:12.661
There's nowhere else he can go.

01:35:14.828 --> 01:35:17.539
- Hey.
- Hey, man. How was your lobster?

01:35:18.082 --> 01:35:20.751
Oh, it wasn't for me. It was a gift.

01:35:23.004 --> 01:35:26.799
You haven't met. This is my friend Margot Tyrell.

01:35:27.883 --> 01:35:29.219
Hello.

01:35:30.010 --> 01:35:33.014
This is Jim Carroll. He's a policeman.

01:35:33.097 --> 01:35:35.100
Show me your passports.

01:35:42.022 --> 01:35:46.151
"Her Britannic Majesty's
Secretary of State requests and requires

01:35:46.235 --> 01:35:48.153
"in the Name of Her Majesty

01:35:48.571 --> 01:35:52.866
"all those whom it may concern
to allow the bearer to pass freely

01:35:53.702 --> 01:35:58.957
"without hindrance, and to afford the bearer
such assistance and protection

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.959
"as may be necessary."

01:36:03.794 --> 01:36:05.921
These are British islands.

01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:09.384
And you're holding British passports.

01:36:10.759 --> 01:36:12.512
You're free to go.

01:36:14.263 --> 01:36:18.810
Thank you. Thank you, no, really.

01:36:18.893 --> 01:36:20.060
Thank you very much.

01:36:21.103 --> 01:36:22.688
Come back soon.

01:36:31.865 --> 01:36:33.574
Goodbye.

01:37:33.634 --> 01:37:34.970
Another?

01:37:36.095 --> 01:37:38.305
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Two more.

01:37:46.146 --> 01:37:48.222
Well?
