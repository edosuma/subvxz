[treadmill whirring]

01:11.605 --> 01:13.207
[beeps]

01:17.411 --> 01:19.213
- WHO WAS THAT?

01:19.247 --> 01:21.349
- BRIAN.
[rips tape]

01:21.382 --> 01:23.651
- AND WHAT DID HE HAVE TO SAY?

01:23.684 --> 01:26.587
- HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
HE JUST HUNG UP.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.322
- SO HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT WAS HIM?

01:28.356 --> 01:29.823
- HIS BREATHING.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.225
HE'S GOT THIS
FUNNY LITTLE WHEEZE

01:31.259 --> 01:33.194
FROM HIS DEVIATED SEPTUM.

01:33.227 --> 01:36.164
- HMM, IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING
ABOUT HIM THAT'S DEVIATED.

01:38.366 --> 01:39.600
- I WONDER WHAT HE WANTED.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.436
- HUH, LET'S SEE,
TO, UH, COME OVER HERE,

01:42.470 --> 01:44.472
THROW HIMSELF AT YOUR FEET
AND BEG FORGIVENESS?

01:44.505 --> 01:46.640
- BRIAN DOESN'T DO APOLOGIES.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.310
- WELL, HE SHOULD,
AFTER WHAT HE DID.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.578
- IT'S TOO LATE.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.247
HE PUSHED TOO HARD.

01:53.281 --> 01:56.417
AND NOW THE GAME IS OVER.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.486
- I KNOW.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.753
AND I'M SORRY.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.589
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.891
I'M GOING TO BE TOO BUSY
BEING HAPPY.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.826
I WON'T EVEN HAVE TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.195
- WHO EVER WOULD
HAVE BELIEVED,

02:07.228 --> 02:08.862
YOU, A MARRIED LADY?

02:08.896 --> 02:12.466
- I PREFER THE TERM
"DOMESTIC PARTNER."

02:12.500 --> 02:13.601
- [snickers]

02:13.634 --> 02:15.736
- WHO CARES WHAT IT'S CALLED,
AS LONG AS I HAVE DAVID?

02:15.769 --> 02:17.705
- AND I HAVE THE APARTMENT!

02:17.738 --> 02:18.939
- [chuckles]

02:18.972 --> 02:20.508
NOW YOU CAN BRING HOME
ALL THE TRICKS YOU WANT

02:20.541 --> 02:22.243
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT DISTURBING ME.

"TRY NOT TO SCREAM SO LOUD
WHEN YOU COME.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.647
WE'LL WAKE UP MICHAEL!"

02:26.680 --> 02:29.650
- WELL, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

02:33.654 --> 02:37.191
- WELL, I GUESS THIS IS IT.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.927
OH! I ALMOST FORGOT.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.797
- HERE,
LET ME HELP YOU.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.909
- I GUESS NOW THIS IS IT.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.348
- GOOD LUCK, SWEETIE.

03:00.381 --> 03:03.817
AND REMEMBER, YOU ALWAYS HAVE
A PLACE TO COME BACK TO.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.387
- THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU,
EMMETT.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.589
ESPECIALLY SINCE I'M STILL
PAYING HALF THE RENT.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.425
- [chuckles]

03:11.459 --> 03:13.594
- CAPTAIN ASTRO USES
HIS MAGICAL FISTING POWER--

03:13.627 --> 03:15.529
- QUIT IT. IT'S TOO EARLY
FOR FISTING.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.431
- NO, IT IS NEVER TOO EARLY
FOR FISTING.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.600
- THE GYM CALLED YOU,
AND YOUR TAILOR CALLED AGAIN.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.868
AND RYDER WANTS YOU--

03:20.901 --> 03:22.636
- OH, FUCK THE GYM,
FUCK THE TAILOR,

03:22.670 --> 03:24.572
AND FUCK RYDER.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.840
COULD YOU PLEASE GET ME
SOME ASPIRIN OR SOMETHING?

03:26.874 --> 03:28.476
I HAVE A BITCH OF A HEADACHE.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.744
- [exhales]

03:30.778 --> 03:32.746
OKAY.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.718
IT'S BEEN A WEEK
SINCE THE USUAL PHONE CALLS

03:37.751 --> 03:39.019
FROM MICHAEL
EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.823
IS HE AWAY OR SOMETHING?

03:42.856 --> 03:45.793
- YEAH, YOU COULD SAY THAT.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.833
[cell phone rings]

03:54.668 --> 03:55.769
- TED SCHMIDT.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.372
- BRIAN.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.773
- BRIAN WHO?

03:59.807 --> 04:02.810
- BRIAN WHO-DO-YOU-THINK?
THAT'S WHO.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.546
- OH. I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
YOUR VOICE.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.748
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE EVER CALLED ME.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.350
- WELL, TODAY'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.784
- I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU,
REMEMBER?

04:10.818 --> 04:13.587
- YEAH, RIGHT. UH, SO WHAT
ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

04:13.621 --> 04:14.888
- I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.457
- WELL, THINK ABOUT IT
AND DECIDE

04:16.490 --> 04:19.360
IF YOU WANT TO HANG OUT.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.628
- WITH YOU?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.029
- YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

04:22.062 --> 04:25.466
- UH, NO. SURPRISED
WOULD BE IF I WON THE LOTTERY.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.700
OR IF AN ASTEROID
HIT THE EARTH,

04:26.734 --> 04:29.002
OR IF RICHARD SIMMONS
WAS STRAIGHT.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.771
NO, TRY DUMBSTRUCK.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.607
- SO YOU'RE NOT BUSY?

04:33.641 --> 04:34.808
- DO YOU HAVE TO ASK?

04:34.842 --> 04:37.345
- WOODY'S. AFTER WORK.

04:44.017 --> 04:48.789
- HE WANTS ME TO MEET HIM
AT WOODY'S TO HANG OUT.

04:48.822 --> 04:52.760
- GOD, HE MUST
REALLY BE DESPERATE.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.062
I-I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.897
- NOW THAT HE AND MICHAEL
ARE NO LONGER FRIENDS,

04:56.930 --> 04:58.966
MY GUESS IS IS THAT
HE NEEDS SOMEBODY NEW

04:58.999 --> 05:00.468
TO TAKE FOR GRANTED.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.803
SO, NATURALLY,
HE THOUGHT OF ME.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.738
- YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
CONSIDERING GOING, ARE YOU?

05:04.772 --> 05:08.442
- WELL, MAYBE I CAN RESOLVE
THE GREAT MICHAEL CONFLICT,

05:08.476 --> 05:09.710
AND WIN THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE

05:09.743 --> 05:12.079
AND SCORE WITH
ONE OF BRIAN'S REJECTS.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.581
- [groans]

05:13.614 --> 05:16.584
49, 50.

05:16.617 --> 05:17.818
[deep breath]

05:17.851 --> 05:21.021
GOD, I HATE MY ABS.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.791
- I LOVE YOUR ABS.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.461
I MEAN YOU.

05:27.495 --> 05:28.962
- HE MEANS YOU.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.364
- YOU'RE EMMETT, RIGHT?

05:30.398 --> 05:31.799
- RIGHT.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.967
- YOU WORK AT TORSO, RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.404
- AND YOUR DENTIST
IS DR. FELDMAN, RIGHT?

05:36.437 --> 05:38.706
- RIGHT, HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHO MY DENTIST IS?

05:38.739 --> 05:40.441
- I WAS IN HIS OFFICE
LAST WEEK.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.843
I HAD THE APPOINTMENT
RIGHT AFTER YOU.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.111
AND BY THE WAY,
I LOVE THE SPACE

05:44.144 --> 05:46.580
BETWEEN YOUR TEETH.

05:46.614 --> 05:47.915
I'M BEAU.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.917
- THAT'S FRENCH FOR "BEAUTIFUL."
- I KNOW.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.586
- AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU WERE KIND OF, UH, CUTE.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.955
- YOU HAVE?
- YEAH.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.123
AND I WAS WONDERING,

05:56.156 --> 05:57.591
IF MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO GO OUT SOMETIME.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.760
- AS IF YOU NEED TO ASK.

05:59.793 --> 06:00.928
- I'D LOVE TO...

06:00.961 --> 06:02.129
- AS IF HE'D SAY NO.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.598
- ONLY I CAN'T.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.899
- WHAT?

06:05.933 --> 06:07.701
- I-I CAN'T.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.770
BUT THANKS FOR ASKING.

06:09.803 --> 06:13.373
- MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME, THEN.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.746
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

06:18.779 --> 06:21.081
GUYS LIKE US DO NOT
TURN DOWN GUYS LIKE HIM.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.750
YOU HAVE ACTED
IN FLAGRANT VIOLATION

06:22.783 --> 06:24.918
OF THE ENTIRE GAY
SOCIAL STRUCTURE.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.520
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE YOU OUT
OF THE BROTHERHOOD.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.856
- LET 'EM. I MADE A PROMISE
TO GOD, REMEMBER?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.057
THAT IF
I TESTED NEGATIVE--

06:30.090 --> 06:31.992
- I KNOW, YOU'D NEVER HAVE SEX
WITH ANOTHER MAN, I KNOW.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.928
BUT Y-YOU'RE FINE.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.497
I NEVER WANT TO GO THROUGH
THE HELL

06:36.530 --> 06:38.766
THAT I WENT THROUGH AGAIN,
AND I WON'T.

06:38.799 --> 06:42.570
BECAUSE SOMEONE KEPT
HIS PART OF THE BARGAIN.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.539
NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO KEEP MINE.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.042
- HEY.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.811
I DIDN'T
HEAR YOU COME IN.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.079
MMM.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.647
[baby crying]

06:53.681 --> 06:54.915
OH.
[shushes]

06:54.948 --> 06:57.918
I JUST PUT GUS TO BED.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.186
- IT'S TOO LATE
TO SEE HIM THEN, HUH?

06:59.219 --> 07:01.955
- OH, YOU CAN SEE HIM
IN THE MORNING.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.524
- HE'S ASLEEP WHEN I LEAVE.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.658
- WELL, MAYBE
YOU COULD LEAVE LATER,

07:04.692 --> 07:06.794
OR EVEN
TAKE THE AFTERNOON OFF.

07:06.827 --> 07:07.995
- THE POINT OF MY
WORKING LONGER DAYS

07:08.028 --> 07:11.765
IS SO YOU CAN STAY HOME.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.534
- I APPRECIATE
HOW HARD YOU WORK.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.969
- WELL, IT WOULD BE NICE
IF YOU SHOWED IT.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.071
- I THOUGHT I DID.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.074
AND, UH, I'M WORKING TOO--

07:21.108 --> 07:23.010
TAKING CARE OF OUR SON.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.513
- YOUR SON AND BRIAN'S.
I JUST PAY THE BILLS.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.681
- OH, ARE WE REALLY
GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN?

07:27.715 --> 07:29.883
- NAH, LET'S PRETEND
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.052
- I DIDN'T SAY
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

07:32.085 --> 07:35.055
I JUST DON'T FEEL THE NEED
TO CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT IT.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.224
- WELL, I'M JEWISH
AND AFTER NEO-NAZIS,

07:37.257 --> 07:39.560
THERE'S NOTHING THE JEWS FEAR
MORE THAN SILENCE.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.794
- WELL, I'M NOT LIKE THAT.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.963
I DON'T HAVE THE NEED
TO CONSTANTLY EXPRESS

07:42.996 --> 07:44.064
EVERYTHING
THAT I'M FEELING.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.232
- WELL, I WISH YOU'D TRY.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.067
'CAUSE AFTER THAT FIASCO
AT BRIAN'S,

07:47.100 --> 07:49.269
YOU'VE TURNED OFF TO ME
PHYSICALLY, EMOTIONALLY--

07:49.302 --> 07:51.104
- AS USUAL,
YOU'RE CATASTROPHIZING,

07:51.138 --> 07:52.873
TURNING EVERY LITTLE SLIGHT
INTO A REJECTION.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.241
- YOU NEVER WANT
TO MAKE LOVE,

07:54.274 --> 07:55.843
YOU BARELY WANT
TO HAVE A DISCUSSION.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.712
- HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU
THAT I MIGHT BE TIRED?

07:58.746 --> 07:59.913
- WELL, I'M TIRED TOO.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.583
I'M TIRED OF TRYING
TO GET THROUGH TO YOU,

08:02.616 --> 08:05.285
OF FIGURING OUT WHAT THE HELL
I DID WRONG,

08:05.318 --> 08:07.020
OF WONDERING WHY
INSTEAD OF FEELING CLOSER

08:07.054 --> 08:10.490
THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN,
I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE ALONE.

08:15.663 --> 08:19.567
AREN'T YOU
GOING TO SAY ANYTHING?

08:19.600 --> 08:20.701
- [clears throat]

08:20.734 --> 08:22.936
WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE FOR DINNER?

08:22.970 --> 08:25.005
I CAN HEAT UP
SOME POT ROAST.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.909
- [scoffs]

08:28.942 --> 08:31.845
- SHOOTERS.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.183
SHOOTER?

08:36.216 --> 08:38.686
CRANTINI SHOOTERS.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.555
ANYBODY?

08:41.589 --> 08:43.523
OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS.

08:45.793 --> 08:49.062
- SO, HOW WAS WORK?

08:49.096 --> 08:51.932
- FAT MARLEY HAD THIS
REALLY INCREDIBLE HICKEY.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.567
AND THERE WAS A SALE
ON PROTEIN POWDER,

08:53.601 --> 08:54.968
SO EVERY QUEEN
IN THE CITY WAS THERE,

08:55.002 --> 08:57.170
EXCEPT FOR YOU, OF COURSE.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.238
- BORING.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.074
WORK WAS BORING.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.843
HOW ABOUT YOU?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.344
- DON'T TELL ME.
YOU TOOK THE CLIENT

09:04.377 --> 09:06.980
TO THIS REALLY
FANCY RESTAURANT FOR LUNCH,

09:07.014 --> 09:10.050
AND THERE WAS THIS REALLY
HOT WAITER AND HE--

09:10.083 --> 09:12.052
HE SIGNALLED FOR YOU
TO MEET HIM IN THE LINEN CLOSET

09:12.085 --> 09:13.987
AND HE GAVE YOU
THIS AMAZING BLOW JOB,

09:14.021 --> 09:15.122
AND THEN YOU
WENT BACK TO THE TABLE

09:15.155 --> 09:16.990
AND THE CLIENT NEVER KNEW.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.628
- HOW'D YOU GUESS?

09:20.661 --> 09:23.797
- I ASKED YOU ABOUT WORK.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.666
- UH, I TOOK A CLIENT
TO LUNCH

09:25.699 --> 09:27.835
AND THE WAITER BLEW ME
IN THE LINEN CLOSET.

09:27.868 --> 09:28.969
- REALLY?

09:29.002 --> 09:31.071
- LIAR! YOU'RE SUCH A LIAR.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.607
- [chuckles]

09:33.641 --> 09:35.108
- [sighs]

09:38.679 --> 09:39.847
- SO, HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.649
- WHO?

09:41.682 --> 09:43.083
- MICHAEL.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.752
- WHAT FOR?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.720
- OH, FOR NO OTHER REASON
THAN HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.356
- WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.894
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL HIM?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.763
- I TOLD YOU.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.365
HE'S OUT OF MY LIFE
AND I'M OUT OF HIS.

09:58.398 --> 10:03.003
SO WOULD YOU PLEASE
SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT IT?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.738
- HEY.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.059
- DO YOU REALIZE
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

23:47.093 --> 23:48.661
HE'S EVER ASKED ME
TO COME OVER?

23:48.695 --> 23:51.664
- SO WHAT
DO YOU THINK IT MEANS?

23:58.571 --> 24:00.640
- IT MEANS HE MISSES MICHAEL.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.809
- [sighs]
ARE THOSE GUYS REALLY

24:02.842 --> 24:05.545
NEVER GOING
TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AGAIN?

24:05.578 --> 24:07.580
- IT LOOKS THAT WAY.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.683
- SO WHY DON'T YOU
TALK TO HIM?

24:10.717 --> 24:11.951
- ME?

24:11.984 --> 24:13.686
- WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU LOVED BRIAN.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.688
AND YOU'RE STAYING
IN MICHAEL'S BEDROOM,

24:15.722 --> 24:19.225
WHICH MAKES YOU, LIKE,
THE MISSING LINK.

24:19.258 --> 24:22.128
WELL, GO ON.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.701
- HEY, BOY WONDER, UH--

24:28.735 --> 24:31.103
A COUPLE OF LEMON SQUARES.
TO GO.

24:31.137 --> 24:34.106
- SURE.

24:42.749 --> 24:46.118
AREN'T YOU
GOING TO TALK TO HIM?

24:46.152 --> 24:47.920
- WHAT FOR?

24:47.954 --> 24:49.088
- HE'S RIGHT THERE.

24:49.121 --> 24:52.058
- STAY THE FUCK OUT OF IT.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.239
- YOU GUYS SHOULD TALK.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.008
- YOU SHOULD
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.543
- BUT HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.178
- JUST GIVE ME
THE LEMON SQUARES.

25:12.211 --> 25:15.181
- HEY, WHERE'S MY ORDER?

25:17.784 --> 25:21.153
- THIS IS A TURKEY SANDWICH.

25:21.187 --> 25:24.190
- THESE ARE LEMON SQUARES.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.902
- [whispers]
SORRY.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.210
- HONEY, I'M HOME!

25:44.243 --> 25:46.145
GOD, I HAVE ALWAYS
WANTED TO SAY THAT.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.214
- HEY, I THOUGHT
I HEARD YOU COMING IN.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.315
- MM.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.350
- AND HONEY,
YOU REALLY ARE HOME.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.020
- YEAH, I PICKED THESE UP
FOR DESSERT.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.023
HOW WAS THE--
GAME?

25:59.692 --> 26:01.928
- PENGUINS LOST IN OVERTIME.

26:01.961 --> 26:05.031
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.667
- THE PLACE LOOKS DIFFERENT.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.670
- YEAH, WELL, I--

26:10.703 --> 26:12.805
I PUT A FEW THINGS AWAY.

26:12.839 --> 26:16.676
- YEAH, LIKE, ALL MY STUFF.

26:16.709 --> 26:20.146
- OH, WELL, IT WAS A BIT, UH,
CLUTTERED.

26:23.049 --> 26:23.883
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

26:23.916 --> 26:26.619
- MY DAY?
MY--MY DAY WAS COMPELLING,

26:26.653 --> 26:27.586
CHOCK FULL OF EVENT.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.322
WE GOT A NEW HANDICAP RAMP,
AND FAT MARLEY

26:30.356 --> 26:33.359
REGALED US WITH HER WITTY
REPERTOIRE OF FAG JOKES.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.862
- [chuckles]
WHAT DID YOU DO?

26:35.895 --> 26:37.964
- I TOLD HER I'M
AN OUT-AND-PROUD HOMOSEXUAL,

26:37.997 --> 26:40.099
AND IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT,
SHE CAN SUCK MY DICK.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.735
- [laughs]

26:42.769 --> 26:45.071
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.372
TRACY DID.

26:46.405 --> 26:49.008
SHE STOOD RIGHT UP TO HER.

26:49.041 --> 26:53.045
- GOOD. SO SHE'S
STILL YOUR FRIEND.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.982
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

26:56.015 --> 27:00.853
- HEY, WELL, ONE GOOD THING
CAME OUT OF WHAT BRIAN DID.

27:00.887 --> 27:04.423
IT MADE YOU REALIZE
THAT YOU BELONG HERE WITH ME.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.860
TAKE OFF YOUR JACKET,
GET READY FOR DINNER.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.841
- ONE SPOONFUL LEFT.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.409
YOU WANT IT?

27:23.442 --> 27:26.846
- NO, IT'LL MEAN 10 MORE MINUTES
ON THE STAIRMASTER.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.014
- MM, COME ON.

27:28.047 --> 27:31.250
I WANT TO SEE YOU
LICK IT OFF THE SPOON.

27:45.998 --> 27:49.401
MMM, ICE CREAM KISS.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.172
YOU SHOULD EAT MORE,
YOU KNOW.

27:53.205 --> 27:56.008
MY MOM SAYS
YOU'RE TOO SKINNY.

27:56.042 --> 27:58.077
- YOUR MOM?
- MM-HMM.

27:58.110 --> 28:02.214
SHE DOESN'T COMPLETELY HATE YOU,
YOU KNOW.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.316
I TOLD HER YOU WERE
ALWAYS SKINNY,

28:04.350 --> 28:06.218
EVEN WHEN YOU WERE
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

28:06.252 --> 28:07.720
- [chuckles]
YOU DON'T KNOW

28:07.754 --> 28:09.188
WHAT I LOOKED LIKE
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.824
- I LIVE IN MICHAEL'S OLD ROOM,
REMEMBER?

28:11.858 --> 28:14.326
WITH ALL HIS
OLD HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOKS,

28:14.360 --> 28:15.962
PICTURES OF YOU.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.396
[chuckles]

28:17.429 --> 28:18.831
YOU WERE A GEEK.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.366
- I WAS NEVER A GEEK.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.769
- THEN EXPLAIN CHEMISTRY CLUB.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.003
- THAT'S WHERE I LEARNED
TO BUILD

28:24.036 --> 28:25.404
THE BOMB
TO BLOW UP THE SCHOOL.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.774
- [laughs]

28:27.807 --> 28:30.209
- BUT MIKEY
TALKED ME OUT OF IT.

28:30.242 --> 28:33.112
- GOOD THING HE WAS AROUND.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.816
I BET YOU WISH
HE WAS HERE RIGHT NOW.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.450
- WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP
ABOUT HIM?

28:38.484 --> 28:39.886
- [chuckles]

28:39.919 --> 28:42.088
I BET YOU'RE
SECRETLY WISHING

28:42.121 --> 28:43.990
THAT THE PHONE WOULD RING
AND IT WOULD BE HIM.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.993
I SAID SHUT THE FUCK UP.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.833
HIS LIFE, IT WAS JUST
GOING TO HANG THERE

28:53.866 --> 28:57.036
LIKE SOME SHIRT
IN THE CLOSET YOU NEVER WEAR.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.905
- SO YOU PUSHED HIM AWAY.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.207
- IT WAS THE ONLY
COURSE OF ACTION.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.542
- YEAH, BUT NOW HE HATES YOU.

29:03.575 --> 29:07.513
- THAT'S OKAY.
AS LONG AS MIKEY'S HAPPY.

29:07.546 --> 29:11.150
- GOD, YOU MUST
REALLY LOVE HIM.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.387
- I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO GO.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.290
- [chuckles]
IT ALWAYS IS.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.695
LUCKILY, YOU CAN'T
PUSH ME AWAY.

29:27.566 --> 29:30.536
I'M ON TO YOU.

29:44.483 --> 29:47.486
[techno music]

29:47.519 --> 29:55.461
*

30:04.036 --> 30:07.139
- EMMETT, YOU CAME.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.308
- HI, I'M TY,
AND I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.576
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

30:10.609 --> 30:12.378
all: HI, TY.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.914
- OUR FIRST SPEAKER TONIGHT
IS GINGER.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.216
AND SHE WAS FORMERLY
IN THE DARK,

30:17.249 --> 30:18.918
BUT NOW SHE'S...

30:18.951 --> 30:23.455
all: SEEN THE LIGHT.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.358
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I, UH,
USED TO BE A LESBIAN.

30:26.392 --> 30:27.927
- USED TO BE?
- SHH.

30:27.960 --> 30:31.497
- BUT THANKS TO TY
AND EVERY BEAUTIFUL PERSON HERE,

30:31.530 --> 30:34.100
I'VE SHED
MY FORMER CORRUPT SELF

30:34.133 --> 30:38.905
AND BECOME THE NEW,
PURIFIED HETEROSEXUAL ME.

30:38.938 --> 30:43.609
[cheers and applause]

30:43.642 --> 30:45.111
- AS YOU CAN SEE,

30:45.144 --> 30:47.313
THE ONLY THING THAT COMES OUT
HERE IS THE TRUTH.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.181
- YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THIS
WAS A COMEDY CLUB.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.416
- EMMETT.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.652
- I CAN TELL YOU,
AND GINGER CAN TELL YOU,

30:53.685 --> 30:56.622
THAT WHAT YOU'RE ALL HOPING
AND PRAYING FOR

30:56.655 --> 30:59.025
IS NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM.

30:59.058 --> 31:01.127
IT COULD COME TRUE FOR YOU,

31:01.160 --> 31:04.296
THE SAME WAY
IT'S COME TRUE FOR US.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.966
YOU CAN CHANGE,
YOU CAN CHANGE...

31:06.999 --> 31:09.001
all: YOU CAN CHANGE.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.870
- I'D START WITH THOSE SHOES.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.243
- YOU.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.111
- UH, M-ME?

31:19.145 --> 31:21.981
- YOU'VE GOT YOUR DOUBTS,
DON'T YOU?

31:22.014 --> 31:24.650
WELL, LET ME ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

31:24.683 --> 31:27.253
DO YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
OBSESS ABOUT YOUR BODIES

31:27.286 --> 31:29.255
AND THE BODIES OF OTHER MEN?

31:29.288 --> 31:32.224
- CHECK OUT HIS PECS.
- THEY'RE, LIKE, PERFECT.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.126
- THEY'RE, LIKE, IMPLANTS.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.263
- DO YOUR CONVERSATIONS CENTER
AROUND TRIVIALITIES?

31:37.296 --> 31:40.032
SUCH AS...MOVIE STARS?

31:40.066 --> 31:42.634
- DID YOU HEAR THAT CHER
HAD HER PUSSY TIGHTENED?

31:42.668 --> 31:44.136
- WHERE'D YOU READ THAT?

31:44.170 --> 31:45.972
THE ENQUIRER
OR POPULAR MECHANICS?

31:46.005 --> 31:49.675
- ARE YOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS SPENT
AT THE GYM AND IN BARS?

31:49.708 --> 31:52.711
GOING HOME WITH MEN WHOSE NAMES
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW?

31:52.744 --> 31:57.083
- SO HE'S COMING AND HE'S GOING,
"FRED, FRED!"

31:57.116 --> 31:59.151
- [laughs]
FRED? WHO'S FRED?

31:59.185 --> 32:02.154
- IF SO, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
ASK YOURSELF,

32:02.188 --> 32:04.957
"IS THIS THE LIFE I WANT
FOR ME?"

32:04.991 --> 32:09.528
"IS THIS THE LIFE GOD WANTS
FOR ME?"

32:09.561 --> 32:14.033
"IS THERE A BETTER LIFE?"

32:15.434 --> 32:17.169
- YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING?

32:17.203 --> 32:19.471
- YEAH, MY BEACH BALL
ALARM CLOCK.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.311
- THIS CLOCK IS FROM

32:25.344 --> 32:29.715
THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART
DESIGN COLLECTION.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.550
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THIS IS MY PLACE TOO.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.285
- IT IS.

32:33.319 --> 32:37.156
- WELL, HOW COME I DON'T SEE
ANY OF MY THINGS?

32:41.193 --> 32:44.296
- MICHAEL, UH, YOU KNOW,
YOUR THINGS...

32:44.330 --> 32:45.998
YOUR TOYS?
THEY'RE, THEY'RE...

32:46.032 --> 32:48.467
THEY'RE CUTE,
THEY'RE CUTE LIKE YOU.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.702
BUT YOU KNOW, THEY S--

32:50.736 --> 32:56.142
THEY SORT OF DON'T BELONG.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.577
LET ME EXPLAIN IT
BY SAYING...

32:58.610 --> 33:01.480
THAT THIS
IS AN ARCHITECTURAL HOUSE.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.649
EVERYTHING HAS ITS PLACE.

33:03.682 --> 33:07.019
SO, IF YOU CLUTTER IT UP,
IT RUINS THE AESTHETIC.

33:07.053 --> 33:09.688
- OH, SO I'M
"CLUTTERING IT UP"?

33:09.721 --> 33:11.757
- NO! OH...

33:11.790 --> 33:13.359
I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY.

33:13.392 --> 33:16.228
- THEY'RE NOT JUST TOYS.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.097
OKAY, SOME OF THEM
ARE COLLECTOR'S ITEMS,

33:18.130 --> 33:19.731
LIKE MY JAPANESE ROBOTS,

33:19.765 --> 33:22.234
OR MY BAKELITE BATMOBILE.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.103
THAT WAS MADE
DURING WORLD WAR II,

33:24.136 --> 33:27.406
WHEN METAL WAS SCARCE.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.675
AND...

33:29.708 --> 33:33.445
EVEN IF THEY WERE WORTHLESS...

33:33.479 --> 33:37.116
THEY WOULD STILL
BE WORTH SOMETHING TO ME

33:37.149 --> 33:41.453
BECAUSE I LOVE THEM.

33:41.487 --> 33:45.157
I KIND OF THOUGHT
YOU KNEW THAT.

33:57.103 --> 33:58.504
- [panting]
LOOK, I JU--

33:58.537 --> 34:00.639
I JUST GOT YOUR PHONE CALL.
[stammering]

34:00.672 --> 34:02.774
I LITERALLY RAN OVER HERE.

34:02.808 --> 34:04.776
SO, WHAT IS THE EMERGENCY?

34:04.810 --> 34:06.645
- HIM.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.747
HE'S HERE EVERY DAY NOW,
SHOWING UP FOR MEALS.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.117
WE'RE SUDDENLY ONE BIG HAPPY
FUCKING FAMILY.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.684
- I DON'T KNOW.

34:12.718 --> 34:15.287
I SENSE SOME TENSION
BETWEEN YOU AND MEL.

34:15.321 --> 34:16.788
- [chuckles]

34:16.822 --> 34:19.791
WELL, SHE BLAMES ME
FOR EVERYTHING.

34:19.825 --> 34:22.528
INCLUDING YOU.
- [scoffs]

34:22.561 --> 34:25.797
- YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT
YOUR PROMISE TO GIVE HER GUS.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.167
- IF SHE WANTS A KID,
SHE CAN HAVE ONE OF HER OWN.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.436
- NO, SHE CAN'T.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.704
GUS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERS
AND MINE.

34:32.738 --> 34:36.275
NOT YOURS AND MINE.

34:36.308 --> 34:37.643
- WELL, LINDSAY'S
ALWAYS COMPLAINING

34:37.676 --> 34:39.345
HE NEVER SPENDS ENOUGH TIME
WITH GUS.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.612
- OH, YOU'RE A BIG HELP.

34:40.646 --> 34:43.315
CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING?
- LIKE WHAT?

34:43.349 --> 34:44.650
- LIKE GET HIM AND MICHAEL
BACK TOGETHER

34:44.683 --> 34:46.752
SO HE WILL LEAVE US ALONE.

34:46.785 --> 34:48.854
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU EVEN MENTION MICHAEL'S NAME,

34:48.887 --> 34:50.389
HE'LL TEAR YOUR HEAD OFF.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.324
- YEAH? WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'M ABOUT TO DO TO HIM.

34:52.358 --> 34:53.825
- SHE ALSO THINKS I'VE TURNED

34:53.859 --> 34:56.795
INTO THIS COLD,
UNRESPONSIVE BITCH.

34:56.828 --> 34:59.865
- HAVE YOU?

34:59.898 --> 35:00.866
- MAYBE A LITTLE.

35:00.899 --> 35:04.603
- WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
FIND YOURSELF SOME NICE,

35:04.636 --> 35:06.838
FUZZY LEZZIE
WITH A THERAPIST'S LICENSE

35:06.872 --> 35:07.873
AND WORK IT OUT.

35:07.906 --> 35:10.609
- THAT'S WHAT MEL WANTS.

35:10.642 --> 35:14.213
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

35:14.246 --> 35:16.415
- I WANT...

35:16.448 --> 35:21.787
I...
[sighs]

35:21.820 --> 35:23.322
[clears throat]

35:23.355 --> 35:24.623
I WANT A BAGEL.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.592
AND AFTER THAT, I DON'T KNOW.

35:26.625 --> 35:30.629
ALL I KNOW IS THAT...

35:30.662 --> 35:34.366
IF I TALK, I MIGHT
SAY SOMETHING I REGRET.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.502
- IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.637
LET OUT SOME
OF THOSE NASTY DEMONS.

35:38.670 --> 35:39.871
- BUT I'M NOT LIKE THAT.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.908
SEE, I'M A WASP
FROM A FAMILY OF WASPS.

35:42.941 --> 35:44.910
- HMM.
- [chuckles]

35:44.943 --> 35:47.379
- TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL TAKE HIM
TO THE TEA DANCE AT WOODY'S.

35:47.413 --> 35:49.515
- GREAT IDEA.
THANKS, TEDDY.

35:49.548 --> 35:50.782
- YEAH.
- MWAH!

35:50.816 --> 35:52.651
- I'M NOT REALLY DOING IT
FOR YOU, YOU KNOW.

35:52.684 --> 35:55.187
HANGING WITH BRIAN...

35:55.221 --> 35:57.656
BEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED
TO MY SEX LIFE.

35:57.689 --> 36:01.493
- [on PA] VIDEO TAPE SPECIAL
TODAY, TEN-PACK FOR--

36:01.527 --> 36:02.661
- SEE YA, MARLEY.

36:02.694 --> 36:08.200
- BYE, TRACE.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.769
- GOOD-BYE, MR. NOVOTNY.

36:13.305 --> 36:16.408
- TRACY!

36:16.442 --> 36:18.510
- YES, MR. NOVOTNY?

36:18.544 --> 36:20.812
- WOULD YOU STOP
CALLING ME THAT, PLEASE?

36:20.846 --> 36:22.781
- WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU?

36:22.814 --> 36:26.552
- WELL, I'M SURE YOU COULD THINK
OF A FEW THINGS.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.787
- I HAVE TO GO.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.989
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE
YOUR JOB.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.959
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE BIG DOLLAR MART?

36:33.992 --> 36:36.762
- WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
THE BIG Q.

36:36.795 --> 36:42.468
- NO, BUT AT LEAST PEOPLE
SEEM HONEST THERE.

36:42.501 --> 36:44.503
YOU PROBABLY THINK THIS
IS ALL ABOUT YOU BEING GAY,

36:44.536 --> 36:46.805
DON'T YOU?

36:46.838 --> 36:51.543
WELL, I ADMIT,
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT FIRST.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.612
BUT THAT'S
NOT THE POINT ANYMORE.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.847
WHETHER YOU'RE GAY
OR YOU'RE STRAIGHT,

36:55.881 --> 36:57.015
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.584
- WE ARE.

36:58.617 --> 37:01.320
- WELL, FRIENDS TRUST
EACH OTHER.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.489
WHAT DID YOU THINK
WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU TOLD ME?

37:03.522 --> 37:06.992
THAT I'D TELL EVERYONE
AT THE STORE?

37:07.025 --> 37:10.329
I WOULDN'T HAVE, MIKE.

37:10.362 --> 37:12.864
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?

37:12.898 --> 37:15.601
- I SHOULD'VE.

37:15.634 --> 37:19.571
BUT WHEN YOU SPEND YOUR ENTIRE
LIFE KEEPING IT A SECRET...

37:19.605 --> 37:22.408
WHO YOU REALLY ARE,

37:22.441 --> 37:24.376
YOU LEARN
TO STOP TRUSTING PEOPLE

37:24.410 --> 37:29.681
AND IT BECOMES SECOND NATURE.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.417
IT KILLS ME
THAT I HURT YOU, TRACE,

37:31.450 --> 37:34.986
AND I'D DO ANYTHING
TO TAKE THAT BACK.

37:35.020 --> 37:39.024
I KNOW I DON'T DESERVE
TO ASK THIS...

37:39.057 --> 37:43.362
BUT DO YOU THINK
WE COULD STILL BE FRIENDS?

37:43.395 --> 37:45.331
- DO YOU THINK
WE COULD BE FRIENDS?

37:49.568 --> 37:51.870
- WELL, WHY DON'T WE GO HAVE
A CUP OF BIG Q COFFEE

37:51.903 --> 37:54.473
AND FIND OUT?

37:54.506 --> 37:55.707
- I'D LIKE THAT.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.377
BUT I-I REALLY DO
HAVE TO GO.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.979
I HAVE A DATE.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.649
- IS HE STRAIGHT?

38:03.682 --> 38:04.783
[chuckles]

[giggles]

38:13.559 --> 38:15.861
AT LAST, NOW WE HAVE THE HOUSE
TO OURSELF,

38:15.894 --> 38:17.963
ALONE.

38:21.700 --> 38:25.504
OH, BY THE WAY, JANET AND
THAT DICKHEAD HUSBAND OF HERS,

38:25.537 --> 38:28.907
THEY FINALLY SENT US A CARD
CONGRATULATING US ON GUS.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.510
ONLY TOOK THREE MONTHS.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.583
- YOU EXPECT TOO MUCH, MEL.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.851
- WHAT?

38:39.885 --> 38:42.087
- I SAID YOU EXPECT TOO MUCH.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.055
- THAT MY SISTER
COULD AT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE

38:44.089 --> 38:45.491
THE BIRTH OF OUR SON?

38:45.524 --> 38:47.426
- OF ME.

38:47.459 --> 38:49.094
YOU WANT ALL MY TIME,
MY DEVOTION,

38:49.127 --> 38:52.864
AND IF YOU DON'T GET IT,
YOU THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.966
YOU GET ANGRY THAT I SEE
THE BABY MORE THAN YOU.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.134
YOU BLAME ME BECAUSE BRIAN

38:56.167 --> 38:57.536
WOULDN'T GIVE YOU
PARENTAL RIGHTS.

38:57.569 --> 38:58.637
I SUPPOSE IT'S EVEN MY FAULT

38:58.670 --> 39:00.105
THAT I CAN HAVE A CHILD
AND YOU CAN'T.

39:00.138 --> 39:02.073
- HEY, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

39:02.107 --> 39:05.110
- I FEEL LIKE I SPEND HALF
MY LIFE APOLOGIZING TO YOU,

39:05.143 --> 39:09.781
TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU
THAT I LOVE YOU.

39:09.815 --> 39:13.485
ONLY NOTHING'S EVER ENOUGH.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.954
I'M STARTING TO WONDER
IF ANYTHING EVER COULD BE.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.497
- [sighs]

39:32.871 --> 39:36.141
WELL, I ASKED YOU TO TALK,
AND YOU DID.

39:55.761 --> 39:59.665
- [groans]

39:59.698 --> 40:03.969
I TELL YOU, HANGING WITH BRIAN
IS EXHAUSTING.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.572
BUT IT'S WORTH IT
FOR THE SEX.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.640
- YOU'RE HAVING SEX
WITH BRIAN?

40:08.674 --> 40:10.476
- OF COURSE NOT.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.110
WE HAVE SYMBIOSIS.

40:12.143 --> 40:14.746
- OH, MY GOD.
IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN DO?

40:14.780 --> 40:16.181
YOU MUSTN'T GIVE UP HOPE.

40:16.214 --> 40:17.783
- IT'S NOT A DISEASE,

40:17.816 --> 40:20.018
IT'S A PERFECT RELATIONSHIP.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.753
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH,

40:21.787 --> 40:24.890
THE YELLOW TICKBIRD
AND THE RHINOCEROS.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.593
THE YELLOW TICKBIRD
FEEDS ON PARASITES

40:27.626 --> 40:30.195
ON THE RHINO'S SKIN,
AND IN TURN,

40:30.228 --> 40:32.898
THE RHINO IS WARNED
OF IMPENDING DANGER

40:32.931 --> 40:35.233
WHEN THE TICKBIRD FLIES AWAY.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.237
SIMILARLY, I SUPPLY BRIAN

40:39.270 --> 40:41.239
WITH AN OBJECT
OF SCORN AND RIDICULE,

40:41.272 --> 40:43.041
NAMELY MYSELF,

40:43.074 --> 40:45.577
AND HE SUPPLIES ME

40:45.611 --> 40:48.680
WITH UNWANTED TICKS,
UH, TRICKS.

40:48.714 --> 40:50.849
- YOU'RE DOING THIS
FOR CASTOFFS?

40:50.882 --> 40:54.553
- WELL, IN BED,
YOU CAN'T TELL.

40:54.586 --> 40:57.589
THEY'RE AS GOOD AS NEW.

40:57.623 --> 41:03.094
- TED, HAVE YOU EVER
ASKED YOURSELF...

41:03.128 --> 41:06.031
"IS--IS GOING TO TEA DANCES
WITH BRIAN

41:06.064 --> 41:08.900
"AND HAVING INDISCRIMINATE SEX
WITH COUNTLESS STRANGERS

41:08.934 --> 41:11.236
REALLY THE LIFE I WANT?"

41:11.269 --> 41:14.239
- I HAVE.
AND THE ANSWER IS,

41:14.272 --> 41:17.943
"YOU BET YOUR ASS IT IS."

41:17.976 --> 41:18.810
- HAVE YOU--
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED,

41:18.844 --> 41:21.580
"IS THIS THE LIFE
GOD WANTS FOR ME?"

41:21.613 --> 41:25.216
- WELL, I SUPPOSE
IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM,

41:25.250 --> 41:29.287
HE DECIDED SOMEBODY
HAD TO LIVE IN PITTSBURGH.

41:29.320 --> 41:33.692
- HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED,
"IS--IS THERE A BETTER LIFE?"

41:33.725 --> 41:35.794
- YEAH.

41:35.827 --> 41:39.865
I COULD HAVE A 10-INCH DICK
AND LOOK LIKE HIM.

41:39.898 --> 41:44.169
- WELL, WHO WOULDN'T
WANT THAT?

42:03.188 --> 42:05.657
- HI.

42:05.691 --> 42:07.125
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

42:07.158 --> 42:08.960
- LOOKING FOR YOU.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.662
- WELL, HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

42:10.696 --> 42:13.031
- WELL, FIRST, I ASKED YOUR MOM,
THEN I CALLED DAVID.

42:13.064 --> 42:14.666
- IS THERE ANYONE
YOU DIDN'T ASK?

42:14.700 --> 42:16.334
- THEN I ASKED BRIAN.

42:16.367 --> 42:20.105
- WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?
LOOK, JUST BUTT OUT.

42:20.138 --> 42:21.873
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

42:21.907 --> 42:25.076
- YEAH, HE SAID THAT WHENEVER
YOU FEEL SAD OR UPSET,

42:25.110 --> 42:27.245
THIS IS WHERE YOU COME.

42:27.278 --> 42:29.781
THAT JUST BEING AROUND
ALL THESE COMICS

42:29.815 --> 42:34.185
BRINGS THE LIGHT
INTO YOUR EYES.

42:34.219 --> 42:35.987
- HE SAID THAT?

42:36.021 --> 42:37.923
- I GUESS HE KNOWS YOU
PRETTY WELL.

42:37.956 --> 42:42.694
- WELL, HE DOESN'T
KNOW ME ANYMORE.

42:42.728 --> 42:43.929
- YEAH.

42:43.962 --> 42:48.667
THAT IS WHY HE GOT YOU THIS.

42:48.700 --> 42:51.236
- I TOLD HIM ALREADY,
I DON'T WANT HIS CRUMMY PRESENT.

42:51.269 --> 42:54.706
- WAIT!

42:54.740 --> 42:57.342
HE MISSES YOU.
HE'S MISERABLE WITHOUT YOU.

42:57.375 --> 42:59.878
- WELL, GOOD,
HE DESERVES TO BE.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.780
- HE LOVES YOU.

43:01.813 --> 43:03.114
HE'LL NEVER ADMIT IT,
BUT HE DOES.

43:03.148 --> 43:04.215
- BRIAN--
- YOU KNOW THAT.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.818
- BRIAN DOESN'T LOVE ANYONE.

43:06.852 --> 43:09.721
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN LOVE,
REMEMBER?

43:09.755 --> 43:11.890
- YOU'RE THE EXCEPTION.

43:11.923 --> 43:15.894
THAT'S WHY HE HURT YOU,
SO YOU'D GO BACK WITH DAVID.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.829
HE KNEW IF HE DIDN'T, YOU'D BE
WAITING FOR HIM FOREVER.

43:17.863 --> 43:20.666
- THAT'S BULLSHIT.

43:20.699 --> 43:25.070
- THIS WAS HIS WAY
OF SAYING GOOD-BYE.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.639
- WE'VE GOT SOME NEW
FRIENDS TO MEET TONIGHT,

43:27.673 --> 43:30.241
WHOSE DARK WORLD
IS ABOUT TO BE ILLUMINATED.

43:30.275 --> 43:33.111

YOU ALL TO GATHER IN THE FOYER

SOME INCREDIBLE BROWNIES

BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER
BECAUSE I'M HERE.

- GREAT.

- TOO MANY.

45:07.405 --> 45:12.210
- KEEP TRACK OF THE DOCTOR,
NOT ME.

45:12.243 --> 45:14.312
- I NEVER THANKED YOU
FOR MY GIFT.

45:14.345 --> 45:15.413
- YOUR GIFT?

45:15.446 --> 45:18.249
- YOUR WARD TRACKED ME DOWN,
INSISTED THAT I TAKE IT.

45:18.283 --> 45:21.219
- YEAH, WELL, I'LL HAVE
TO PUNISH HIM SEVERELY.

45:21.252 --> 45:23.421
- IT'S THE NEATEST THING
I EVER GOT.

45:23.454 --> 45:26.191

- WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT IT.

45:42.173 --> 45:44.442
- [chuckles]
I HEARD YOU WERE FREAKING OUT.

45:44.475 --> 45:46.344

- WELL, THEY'RE
PATHOLOGICAL LIARS.

THAT SUPERMAN DIES

SAW YOU MORE

A LITTLE WHIMSY.

- YOU KNOW, YOUR MOVING IN
WAS A BIG CHANGE FOR ME TOO.

47:34.519 --> 47:37.923
I SAW YOUR STUFF
AND I SUDDENLY REALIZED...

47:37.956 --> 47:42.660
THAT I WAS "WE" AGAIN.

47:42.693 --> 47:46.631
THAT MY LIFE WAS NOW OUR LIFE.

47:49.134 --> 47:54.205
IT KIND OF FREAKED ME OUT.

47:54.239 --> 47:55.506
- WELL, I'M GLAD TO KNOW
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE

47:55.540 --> 47:58.509
WHO'S SCARED SHITLESS.

47:58.543 --> 48:01.379
- YOU KNOW, I'VE, UH...

48:01.412 --> 48:03.248
BEEN READING YOUR COMICS.

48:03.281 --> 48:05.550
- OH, YEAH?
- I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

48:05.583 --> 48:07.618
I-I NEVER REALLY GOT A CHANCE
TO DO THAT WHEN I WAS A KID.

48:07.652 --> 48:10.688
MY PARENTS WERE PRETTY STRICT.

48:10.721 --> 48:13.524
- YOU PROBABLY HAD TO READ
TOLSTOY AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

48:13.558 --> 48:17.528
- [chuckles]
ACTUALLY, THEY'RE KIND OF FUN.

48:17.562 --> 48:20.498
DID YOU KNOW...

48:20.531 --> 48:23.601
THAT FOR ONE SPECIAL DAY
IN 1970,

48:23.634 --> 48:28.306
CAPTAIN ASTRO
BECAME ASTRO WOMAN?
