WEBVTT

00:02.367 --> 00:04.633
- HEY.
THERE THEY ARE.

00:04.633 --> 00:06.133
HOW WAS THE CARNIVAL?

00:06.133 --> 00:08.600
- UNCLE ROBERT THREW UP.
- ON A RIDE.

00:11.067 --> 00:12.733
- OH, ROBERT.

00:12.733 --> 00:16.867
- HE WAS ON ONE
OF THE SPINNING RIDES.

00:16.867 --> 00:20.233
HE NAILED 11 PEOPLE.

00:21.867 --> 00:26.733
- I HAD TO BUY A GUY
A SHIRT.

00:26.733 --> 00:28.000
- HEY, GUESS WHAT.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.033
THAT WAS MY COLLEGE
ON THE PHONE.

00:29.033 --> 00:30.200
THEY WANT TO GIVE ME A DEGREE.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.167
- I THOUGHT
YOU HAD A DEGREE.

00:32.167 --> 00:34.933
- YEAH, WHAT THE HELL
WERE WE PAYING FOR?

00:34.933 --> 00:36.433
- IT'S ANOTHER ONE.

00:36.433 --> 00:38.633
THEY CALL IT
A HONORARY DOCTORATE.

00:38.633 --> 00:41.167
- OH!
- OH!

00:41.167 --> 00:44.733
- I MIGHT THROW UP AGAIN.

00:44.733 --> 00:46.133
- OH, MY GOD!

00:46.133 --> 00:48.200
RAYMOND,
YOU'RE A DOCTOR!

00:48.200 --> 00:50.067
- A DOCTORATE, MA.

00:50.067 --> 00:52.167
THEY CALL IT
A DOCTORATE OF LETTERS.

00:52.167 --> 00:54.867
- THAT IS SO GREAT,
HONEY, AWW...

00:54.867 --> 00:58.133
- WOW, RAY,
CONGRATULATIONS!

00:58.133 --> 01:01.633
WE ARE SO HAPPY
FOR YOU.

01:01.633 --> 01:03.467
- HOW MUCH DO THEY CHARGE
FOR THIS?

01:03.467 --> 01:05.333
- NOTHING.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.300
NO CONTRIBUTION AT ALL?

01:07.300 --> 01:08.700
LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING--

01:08.700 --> 01:12.433
EDUCATION IS
THE BIGGEST SCAM GOING.

01:12.433 --> 01:15.767
- DR. RAYMOND ALBERT BARONE.

01:15.767 --> 01:18.000
- YEAH, YEAH.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.400
- HEY, DOCTOR,
I GOT A MOLE

01:19.400 --> 01:22.500
YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT
ON MY BACKSIDE.

01:29.433 --> 01:32.733
- WELL, YOU MUST BE
MY 9:30.

01:32.733 --> 01:37.167
- MM-HMM.

01:37.167 --> 01:39.933
SO WHAT'S YOUR DIAGNOSIS?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.167
- I DON'T KNOW YET.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.067
I MIGHT HAVE TO PUT
MY HEALING HANDS

01:43.067 --> 01:46.533
ON YOUR LOVE-STARVED BODY.
- OOH.

01:46.533 --> 01:47.767
OH, DOCTOR.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.100
[both laugh]

01:49.100 --> 01:50.533
DR. RAY.

01:50.533 --> 01:51.700
[laughs]

01:51.700 --> 01:53.267
- WHAT?
WHAT?

01:53.267 --> 01:56.467
- NO, IT'S JUST FUNNY
CALLING YOU DOCTOR.

01:56.467 --> 01:59.233
- IT'S NOT THAT FUNNY.

01:59.233 --> 02:03.867
- DR. RAYMOND BARONE, Ph.D.

02:03.867 --> 02:06.300
- ALL RIGHT, STOP IT.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.933
COME ON, YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL

02:07.933 --> 02:11.633
ABOUT LAUGHING
DURING SEX.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.267
- YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
YOU'RE NOT

02:13.267 --> 02:16.433
THE MOST PROFESSORIAL
KIND OF GUY.

02:16.433 --> 02:18.633
- I CAN BE
EXCEEDINGLY PROFESSORIAL.

02:18.633 --> 02:19.633
- NO, I KNOW.

02:19.633 --> 02:22.033
I WAS JUST REMEMBERING
THAT TIME

02:22.033 --> 02:25.767
YOU READ THE WORD
"STOMA-CHA-CHUH."

02:27.233 --> 02:29.133
- WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

02:29.133 --> 02:32.300
- YOU READ
"STOMA-CHA-CHUH."

02:32.300 --> 02:35.967
AND THE WORD
REALLY IS...

02:35.967 --> 02:39.567
- STOMACHACHE.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.633
- I AM JUST
TEASING YOU.

02:49.633 --> 02:50.633
- YEAH, RIGHT.

02:50.633 --> 02:51.867
- NO, COME ON.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.433
COME ON,
KISS ME AGAIN.

02:53.433 --> 02:57.200
HEY, FOR ONCE, I DON'T HAVE
A "HEAD-AH-CHA-CHUH."

02:57.200 --> 02:58.800
- ALL RIGHT, FORGET IT.
- NO, I'M KIDDING.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.367
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JUST LIKE
ROBERT AND MY FATHER.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.067
YOU DON'T THINK
I DESERVE THIS.

03:03.067 --> 03:06.033
- NO, OF COURSE,
I THINK YOU DESERVE THIS.

03:06.033 --> 03:07.900
- EVEN THOUGH I'M AN IDIOT.
- YES.

03:07.900 --> 03:10.800
NO, NO,
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.733
NO, YOU'RE VERY SMART.
YOU DESERVE THIS.

03:13.733 --> 03:15.367
YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

03:15.367 --> 03:18.000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"DO GREAT"?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.533
- WHEN YOU GIVE
YOUR SPEECH.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.233
WELL, YOU--

03:23.233 --> 03:26.733
YOU KNEW YOU HAD
TO GIVE A SPEECH, RIGHT?

03:29.633 --> 03:32.933
RAY, WHEN THEY GIVE YOU
AN HONORARY DIPLOMA,

03:32.933 --> 03:34.800
YOU GIVE A SPEECH.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.067
- IN FRONT OF PEOPLE?

03:38.067 --> 03:41.133
- WELL, IT'S NOT
A SPEECH OTHERWISE.

03:41.133 --> 03:46.200
IT'S JUST A CRAZY MAN.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.933
- OH, MY GOD.

03:47.933 --> 03:49.233
- HONEY, YOU'LL DO FINE.

03:49.233 --> 03:51.533
- NO, I WON'T!

03:51.533 --> 03:53.000
THEY'RE GONNA EXPECT ME
TO BE SMART

03:53.000 --> 03:54.400
IN FRONT OF SMART PEOPLE

03:54.400 --> 03:56.133
AND SAY SMART THINGS,
AND I'M NOT SMART,

03:56.133 --> 03:58.033
YOU KNOW IT, AND I KNOW IT.
WE ALL KNOW IT.

03:58.033 --> 03:59.800
WHO AM I KIDDING?

03:59.800 --> 04:02.433
- RAY, COME OUT.

04:02.433 --> 04:04.400
- NO!

04:04.400 --> 04:07.433
I'M NEVER COMING OUT,
SO YOU'RE FREE TO REMARRY.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.167
- RAY...
- JUST...

04:12.167 --> 04:16.800
REMEMBER I CAN HEAR YOU
IN HERE.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.633
- HONEY, LISTEN...

04:19.633 --> 04:24.533
THEY WANT YOU BECAUSE
YOU'RE GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO.

04:24.533 --> 04:26.167
THEY WANT THE STUDENTS
TO SEE SOMEONE

04:26.167 --> 04:28.600
WHO LOVES HIS WORK
AND IS A SUCCESS.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.567
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SOUND
LIKE A PROFESSOR.

04:30.567 --> 04:32.900
WHAT THEY WANT
IS RAY BARONE.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.400
YOU GIVE THEM THAT,

04:34.400 --> 04:37.000
AND I PROMISE
THEY WILL LOVE YOU.

04:45.700 --> 04:46.767
- YEAH?

04:46.767 --> 04:49.300
- POSITIVE.

04:53.600 --> 04:59.067
OOH, I'M FEELING
FEVERISH, DOCTOR.

04:59.067 --> 05:01.433
- OH, YES.
YES, YOU ARE.

05:01.433 --> 05:03.767
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
CAUGHT SOMETHING

05:03.767 --> 05:05.767
FROM THE REST
OF THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD.

05:05.767 --> 05:07.367
- OH, YES.

05:11.367 --> 05:14.067
- STEP INTO MY OFFICE.
- OOH!

05:18.167 --> 05:19.367
SO MUCH FUN.

05:19.367 --> 05:21.267
JUST BRING BACK MEMORIES
AND, YOU KNOW...

05:21.267 --> 05:24.467
- OH, WASN'T THAT
WONDERFUL?

05:38.367 --> 05:40.633
- IT WAS PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT?
YEAH.

05:40.633 --> 05:42.400
- ALL THE MONEY
ON THAT DAMN COLLEGE,

05:42.400 --> 05:46.067
THEY CAN'T PUT A CUSHION
ON A FOLDING CHAIR?

05:46.067 --> 05:48.967
MY MOLE IS KILLING ME!

05:48.967 --> 05:50.200
- BOBBY, ARE YOU SURE

05:50.200 --> 05:51.800
YOU GOT A PICTURE
OF RAYMOND

05:51.800 --> 05:53.133
SHAKING THE DEAN'S HAND?

05:53.133 --> 05:54.433
- I'M SURE, MOM.

05:54.433 --> 05:56.433
- AND PICTURES OF ME
KISSING RAYMOND?

05:56.433 --> 05:59.467
- WE HAVE ENOUGH
TO MAKE WALLPAPER.

05:59.467 --> 06:02.800
- HEY, LISTEN, GUYS,
ALL RIGHT, NOW THAT WE'RE HERE,

06:02.800 --> 06:04.267
REALLY, TELL ME,

06:04.267 --> 06:06.200
HOW WAS MY SPEECH?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.167
- EVERYONE LOVED IT!
- YEAH?

06:08.167 --> 06:10.200
- IT REALLY
WAS GREAT, RAY.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.067
SO FOLKSY.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.933
- YOU DID
A GOOD JOB, HONEY.

06:13.933 --> 06:18.000
- YEAH, YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR ROBE OFF NOW, MERLIN.

06:22.733 --> 06:24.833
BY THE WAY, WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO MENTION TO EVERYBODY

06:24.833 --> 06:27.500
THAT WHEN I WAS A KID,
I COULDN'T THROW A SPIRAL?

06:27.500 --> 06:30.600
- THAT WAS TO SHOW HOW
I GOT INTO CRITIQUING SPORTS.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.000
- I LIKED THE PART
ABOUT ME CURSING

06:32.000 --> 06:33.367
AT THE PLAYERS ON TV.

06:33.367 --> 06:35.133
- YEAH, YEAH, YOU LIKED THAT?

06:35.133 --> 06:36.233
- IT'S NICE
TO KNOW YOU HAVE

06:36.233 --> 06:39.567
AN INFLUENCE
ON YOUR KIDS.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.967
- IT WAS THE BEST SPEECH
I HAVE EVER HEARD.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.233
- AH, YOU JUST LIKED IT

06:44.233 --> 06:46.000
BECAUSE YOU GOT
A BIG SPECIAL MENTION.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.300
- DID I?
I DIDN'T NOTICE.

06:50.300 --> 06:52.800
- YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD,
RAY.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.367
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

06:54.367 --> 06:56.800
- LET'S CELEBRATE, HUH?
PUT OUT SOME FOOD.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.633
- I'LL HELP YOU.
- OKAY.

06:58.633 --> 07:02.767
- OOH, YES,
THAT'S GOOD THINKING, AMY.

07:02.767 --> 07:05.500
- SO, RAY'S BIG DAY...

07:05.500 --> 07:07.533
YOU MUST BE
SO PROUD OF HIM.

07:07.533 --> 07:09.333
- YEAH,
I AM PROUD OF HIM.

07:10.767 --> 07:11.933
- WHAT'S WRONG?

07:11.933 --> 07:13.300
- NOTHING.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.400
- COME ON,
SOMETHING'S UP.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.200
- NO, REALLY,
IT'S NOTHING.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.200
- YOU CAN TELL ME.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.600
- WELL, HE MADE A GREAT
SPEECH TODAY, RIGHT?

07:25.600 --> 07:27.967
I MEAN, HOW HE WORKED IN
ALL THOSE LITTLE STORIES

07:27.967 --> 07:29.533
ABOUT EVERYBODY IN HIS LIFE?

07:29.533 --> 07:31.133
- YEAH, THAT WAS
MY FAVORITE PART.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.567
- DID YOU NOTICE
HE DIDN'T MENTION ME?

07:33.567 --> 07:36.667
- OF COURSE HE DID.
- NO.

07:36.667 --> 07:40.067
- NO, I MEAN, HE MENTIONED
FRANK AND ROBERT

07:40.067 --> 07:42.700
AND THANKED MARIE
AT THE END AND...

07:42.700 --> 07:46.400
OH, MY GOD,
HE DIDN'T MENTION YOU.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.133
- IT'S FINE.
IT IS.

07:49.133 --> 07:50.767
- YOU KNOW, DEB,
I'M SURE RAY

07:50.767 --> 07:53.933
JUST MADE SOME KIND
OF MISTAKE IN HIS SPEECH.

07:53.933 --> 07:55.767
HE JUST FORGOT.
YOU SHOULD ASK HIM.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.867
- NO, NO, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT.

07:57.867 --> 08:00.033
I WANT HIM
TO ENJOY HIS DAY.

08:00.033 --> 08:03.200
- WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
DIPLOMA.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.567
- WHY DON'T YOU
KEEP IT, MA?

08:04.567 --> 08:05.500
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.467
- REALLY? OH, NO.
- SURE.

08:07.467 --> 08:10.200
I CAN'T HANG IT UP HERE.
IT'D BE LIKE BRAGGING.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.800
BESIDES, YOU DESERVE IT.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.200
- OH, WHAT A BOY!

08:15.200 --> 08:19.533
- OKAY, OKAY.
OKAY, OKAY.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.533
- HE SAID OKAY!

08:32.267 --> 08:34.067
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE, RAY?

08:34.067 --> 08:36.333
- HUH?

08:40.667 --> 08:43.267
- DEBRA WOULD KILL ME FOR THIS,
BECAUSE SHE WON'T SAY ANYTHING,

08:43.267 --> 08:46.567
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.767
YOU DIDN'T MENTION HER
IN YOUR SPEECH.

08:48.767 --> 08:53.200
- WHAT?
NO...YES, I DID.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.733
I DIDN'T?

09:05.267 --> 09:08.867
- OH, MY GOD.

09:08.867 --> 09:11.100
YOU DIDN'T
THANK YOUR WIFE.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.967
YOU SCREWED THE POOCH!

09:13.967 --> 09:16.200
- ROBERT, QUIET!

09:16.200 --> 09:17.467
- WHAT DID HE DO?

09:17.467 --> 09:20.067
- HE DIDN'T THANK DEBRA.
- AMY!

09:20.067 --> 09:24.200
- NO, NO, NO, I DID.
I DID. I KNOW I DID.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.333
I WROTE...I WROTE...
I WROTE...

09:26.333 --> 09:28.633
LOOK, I WROTE ABOUT--
I WROTE ABOUT SCHOOL.

09:28.633 --> 09:34.167
I WROTE ABOUT--
I WROTE ABOUT SPORTS, AND I...

09:36.967 --> 09:39.867
OH, NO.

09:39.867 --> 09:41.967
- DIDN'T EVEN JOT HER NAME DOWN
IN THE MARGINS.

09:41.967 --> 09:43.900
- AMY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:43.900 --> 09:46.333
- HELPING?

09:46.333 --> 09:47.367
- LET'S GO BACK, COME ON.
COME ON, LET'S GO BACK.

09:47.367 --> 09:49.400
I'LL GIVE ANOTHER SPEECH.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.667
THERE'S PROBABLY STILL
PEOPLE IN THE CAFETERIA.

09:50.667 --> 09:51.633
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.233
COME ON,
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

09:53.233 --> 09:55.433
HUH?
THIS IS YOUR DAY.

09:55.433 --> 10:00.200
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.000
I'M GONNA GO
CHECK ON THE KIDS.

10:09.700 --> 10:14.100
- SO SHOULD WE BURY YOU
IN THAT DRESS?

10:22.100 --> 10:24.333
- LISTEN, DEBRA,
I JUST WANT TO SAY--

10:24.333 --> 10:26.167
- NO, REALLY, RAY.
IT'S OKAY.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.500
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE AGAIN.

10:28.500 --> 10:32.100
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO THANK YOUR WIFE, AND--

10:32.100 --> 10:34.467
AND YOU ARE
MY WIFE, RIGHT?

10:34.467 --> 10:36.733
- YES, I'M YOUR WIFE.

10:36.733 --> 10:40.567
- AND I AM A STUPID,
STUPID DOCTOR.

10:40.567 --> 10:43.067
- NO, HONEY, REALLY.
IT REALLY IS OKAY.

10:43.067 --> 10:45.167
I WASN'T EVEN
GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

10:45.167 --> 10:46.300
- YEAH, BUT YOU
DID SAY SOMETHING.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.200
- NO, I DIDN'T.
- TO AMY.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.400
- YES, TO AMY,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT

10:49.400 --> 10:51.033
SHE WOULDN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU.

10:51.033 --> 10:53.967
AND NOW I HAVE
TO KILL HER.

10:53.967 --> 10:55.700
- OKAY, SEE?
IT DID BOTHER YOU.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.867
- NO, REALLY,
DON'T OBSESS ABOUT THIS.

10:57.867 --> 11:00.533
IT WAS A GREAT DAY,
I'M PROUD OF YOU,

11:00.533 --> 11:03.800
AND WE DON'T NEED TO TALK
ABOUT IT ANYMORE, OKAY?

11:03.800 --> 11:06.067
- OKAY.

11:06.067 --> 11:07.500
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT WAS--

11:07.500 --> 11:10.633
IT WAS JUST A FLUKE,
ANYWAY, RIGHT?

11:10.633 --> 11:12.267
- NIGHT.
- NIGHT.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.167
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

11:22.167 --> 11:23.700
I KNOW WHY I DID IT.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.400
IT'S BECAUSE THIS WAS
AN AWARD FROM COLLEGE,

11:26.400 --> 11:27.867
SO I WAS THINKING
OF ALL THE PEOPLE

11:27.867 --> 11:32.667
THAT HELPED ME
THROUGH COLLEGE, AT THAT TIME.

11:32.667 --> 11:35.333
I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW YOU THEN.

11:37.633 --> 11:39.600
- WELL, WHERE WERE
ALL THOSE PEOPLE THE OTHER NIGHT

11:39.600 --> 11:41.400
WHEN YOU WERE HIDING
IN YOUR CLOSET,

11:41.400 --> 11:43.333
AFRAID TO GIVE
YOUR SPEECH?

11:43.333 --> 11:46.367
- I WASN'T HIDING.
I WAS MAKING MY SPECIAL MAGIC.

11:46.367 --> 11:50.200
- WELL, YOU COULDN'T HAVE
THANKED THOSE PEOPLE

11:50.200 --> 11:51.767
IF I HADN'T GIVEN YOU
THE CONFIDENCE

11:51.767 --> 11:53.233
TO MAKE YOUR SPEECH.

11:53.233 --> 11:55.233
- WHAT CONFIDENCE?
I REMEMBER YOU MAKING FUN OF ME

11:55.233 --> 11:58.167
AND GIGGLING
AND "STOMA-CHAH-CHUH."

11:58.167 --> 12:00.333
- YES, BUT THEN
I ENCOURAGED YOU,

12:00.333 --> 12:01.700
AND YOU WERE ABLE
TO GET UP

12:01.700 --> 12:04.167
IN FRONT OF THOSE PEOPLE
AND GIVE A GREAT SPEECH.

12:04.167 --> 12:05.333
- YEAH, YOU ENCOURAGED ME,

12:05.333 --> 12:06.600
BUT FIRST,
YOU HAD TO TEAR ME DOWN

12:06.600 --> 12:08.800
SO YOU COULD BUILD ME
BACK UP AGAIN.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.200
- WHAT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.267
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

12:11.267 --> 12:12.600
AND YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL

12:12.600 --> 12:15.900
THAT I DO NOT COME OUT
SMARTER THAN YOU.

12:15.900 --> 12:19.900
- I NEVER REALLY
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

12:19.900 --> 12:23.567
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
SEE?

12:23.567 --> 12:25.667
THAT'S TEARING ME DOWN,
TEARING ME DOWN.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.133
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE THAT'S WHY
SOMETHING IN MY HEAD

12:27.133 --> 12:28.367
PREVENTED ME
FROM THANKING YOU.

12:28.367 --> 12:31.533
- [gasps]
OH, MY GOD.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.767
- WHAT?
- YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE?

12:33.767 --> 12:36.333
- NO, NO.
NO!

12:36.333 --> 12:38.733
NO, I SAID SOMETHING
IN MY HEAD DID IT.

12:38.733 --> 12:40.600
- YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE
YOU THINKING IT.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.500
- NO, NO, NO!

12:42.500 --> 12:45.933
- YOU'RE NOT A STUPID DOCTOR.
YOU'RE AN EVIL DOCTOR!

12:45.933 --> 12:48.233
- NO, NO, I'M STUPID.

12:48.233 --> 12:50.700
I'M A STUPID MAN!
YOU KNOW THAT!

12:50.700 --> 12:52.800
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

12:52.800 --> 12:56.267
- DEBRA, IT WAS SOMETHING
I DID UNCONSCIOUSLY.

12:56.267 --> 12:57.600
- SUBCONSCIOUSLY.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.533
UNCONSCIOUS MEANS
YOU'RE NOT AWAKE.

13:00.533 --> 13:03.767
- YOU SEE THAT?
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!

13:05.400 --> 13:10.133
I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T DESERVE THE DAMN THING.

13:12.900 --> 13:17.400
- NO, LISTEN, HONEY, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO FEEL THAT WAY.

13:19.700 --> 13:23.133
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO LEAVE ME OUT.

13:23.133 --> 13:26.833
IT'S JUST...

13:26.833 --> 13:28.033
- IT BOTHERS YOU.

13:28.033 --> 13:29.367
- YES, IT BOTHERS ME,

13:29.367 --> 13:30.867
BUT IT BOTHERS ME
THAT IT BOTHERS ME.

13:30.867 --> 13:34.233
YOU KNOW, I DON'T NEED YOU
TO SAY NICE THINGS

13:34.233 --> 13:36.133
ABOUT ME IN PUBLIC.

13:36.133 --> 13:40.167
I JUST...
I DON'T KNOW...

13:40.167 --> 13:44.500
I WANT YOU TO.
I DON'T KNOW. I'M SORRY.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.500
YOU'RE A VERY GOOD DOCTOR.
I'M SO SORRY, GOOD NIGHT.

13:57.267 --> 14:01.233
- I'M GLAD YOU FEEL BETTER.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.867
HEY, HERE SHE IS.
COFFEE?

14:07.867 --> 14:09.800
- THANK YOU.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:11.267 --> 14:14.467
- NOTHIN'.

14:14.467 --> 14:17.633
REMEMBER THE OTHER NIGHT?

14:17.633 --> 14:18.867
READ THE PAPER.

14:18.867 --> 14:20.433
- YOUR COLUMN?
- YES, EXACTLY.

14:20.433 --> 14:22.633
MY COLUMN.
READ MY COLUMN.

14:22.633 --> 14:24.367
- YOU THINK PLAYERS

14:24.367 --> 14:26.333
SHOULD STOP DUMPING GATORADE
ON THEIR COACHES' HEADS.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.400
IT'S WASTEFUL AND STICKY.

14:31.067 --> 14:32.333
- UNLESS IT'S
A CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.600
THEN IT'S OKAY.
LITTLE LOWER.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.933
- "I'M OFTEN ASKED BY PEOPLE
WHO WANT TO BE SPORTSWRITERS,

14:37.933 --> 14:39.600
"'HOW DID YOU GET STARTED?'

14:39.600 --> 14:42.400
"AND I UNDERSTAND THIS QUESTION,
BECAUSE OF ALL THE PLUM JOBS,

14:42.400 --> 14:46.133
I'VE GOT THE PLUM-EST."

14:46.133 --> 14:47.667
- NO, THERE'S MORE.
THERE'S MORE.

14:47.667 --> 14:49.767
- YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'LL FINISH IT

14:49.767 --> 14:50.900
WHEN THE COFFEE KICKS IN.

14:50.900 --> 14:51.900
BUT IT SEEMS
REALLY GOOD.

14:51.900 --> 14:55.833
- NO...

14:55.833 --> 14:57.700
"AND IT'S
A FAIR QUESTION TO ASK ME,

14:57.700 --> 15:00.667
"BECAUSE I AM, AFTER ALL,
MOSTLY QUALIFIED

15:00.667 --> 15:02.900
"TO DO SOMETHING
LIKE DELIVER FUTONS.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.767
"SO HOW DID I GET HERE?

15:05.767 --> 15:09.033
"YOU SEE, THERE WAS
THIS FUTON DELIVERY GUY,

15:09.033 --> 15:10.600
AND HE MET
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN."

15:10.600 --> 15:15.500
OH, NOW YOU'RE LISTENING,
YEAH.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.900
"AND EVEN THOUGH SHE
WAS WAY OUT OF HIS LEAGUE,

15:17.900 --> 15:20.533
"FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON,
SHE SMILED AT HIM.

15:20.533 --> 15:23.800
"EVENTUALLY,
AND EVEN MORE AMAZINGLY,

15:23.800 --> 15:25.433
"SHE MARRIED HIM.

15:25.433 --> 15:27.933
"AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN
ONE OF YOUR DREAMS COMES TRUE,

15:27.933 --> 15:32.167
"YOU BEGIN TO TAKE THE OTHERS
A LITTLE MORE SERIOUSLY.

15:32.167 --> 15:35.100
"SO EVEN THOUGH
I'M AS AMAZED AS ANYBODY

15:35.100 --> 15:38.000
"THAT I HAVE
ANY SUCCESS AT ALL,

15:38.000 --> 15:42.733
I'M PRETTY SURE IT ALL STARTED
WITH MY WIFE DEBRA'S SMILE."

15:45.100 --> 15:47.400
I WROTE THAT.

15:52.067 --> 15:55.400
- THAT IS THE SWEETEST THING.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.967
- YEAH?
NOT TOO SAPPY?

15:56.967 --> 16:00.233
- IT'S WAY TOO SAPPY.

16:02.767 --> 16:04.067
- GOOD MORNING.

16:04.067 --> 16:07.800
- HEY.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.400
HI, MA.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.800
- HI, MARIE.
HI, FRANK.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.600
SEE YOUR SON'S COLUMN
THIS MORNING?

16:13.600 --> 16:14.900
- YES, WE DID.

16:14.900 --> 16:17.067
WE THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL,
DIDN'T WE, FRANK?

16:17.067 --> 16:21.233
- THEN WHY DID YOU
DRAG ME OVER HERE?

16:21.233 --> 16:23.133
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
A MARVELOUS PIECE.

16:23.133 --> 16:25.867
FULL OF GRATITUDE
AND FEELINGS

16:25.867 --> 16:27.500
THAT WERE
SO OVERWHELMING,

16:27.500 --> 16:30.333
THAT IT NEEDED
TO BE EXPRESSED IN WRITING.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.467
IN THE NEWSPAPER.

16:32.467 --> 16:36.733
- MA, I THANKED YOU
AT THE GRADUATION.

16:36.733 --> 16:42.567
- YES, YOU MADE SOME VAGUE
REFERENCE TO SOME "MOTHER"

16:42.567 --> 16:45.633
IN FRONT OF A FEW PEOPLE
ON A LAWN.

16:45.633 --> 16:47.767
- WHAT?

16:47.767 --> 16:49.133
- YOU NEVER MENTIONED MY NAME.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.733
IT WAS, QUITE FRANKLY,
RATHER PERFUNCTORY.

16:52.733 --> 16:54.600
- OH, COME ON.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.967
- YET DEBRA'S
MAGICAL SMILE

16:56.967 --> 16:59.200
GETS ALL THE CREDIT
IN FRONT OF--

16:59.200 --> 17:01.800
WHAT'S THE CIRCULATION
OF THE PAPER?

17:01.800 --> 17:02.800
- OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.733
- 850,000.

17:10.100 --> 17:15.167
- 850,000.

17:15.167 --> 17:18.700
WHAT ABOUT
MY SMILE, RAYMOND?

17:18.700 --> 17:20.700
WHAT ABOUT MY SMILE?

17:20.700 --> 17:22.267
- AND I LIKE IT
WHEN THEY DUMP THE GATORADE

17:22.267 --> 17:25.233
ON THE COACH'S HEAD.

17:25.233 --> 17:28.600
THAT'S FUNNY.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.700
- DID YOU SEE THE PAPER?
- YES, SHE SAW.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.967
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS SAW.

17:32.967 --> 17:34.900
- ISN'T IT GREAT?

17:34.900 --> 17:36.667
RAY, THAT WAS SO NICE.

17:36.667 --> 17:40.133
SEE, DEB, MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH
A BIG MISTAKE TO BRING IT UP.

17:40.133 --> 17:41.733
- THANK YOU, AMY.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.600
- GO AHEAD, ROBERT.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.300
- UH, RAYMOND, YOUR SUCCESS
IS YOUR SUCCESS

17:52.300 --> 17:54.567
AND NOT MY FAILURE.

17:58.467 --> 18:01.167
AND SO, AS ANY GOOD BROTHER
SHOULD BE,

18:01.167 --> 18:04.467
I AM HAPPY FOR YOU.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.833
- BOTH MY SONS ARE WHIPPED!

18:09.833 --> 18:12.300
- HOWEVER, RAYMOND,

18:12.300 --> 18:13.900
IF ANYBODY SHOULD GET CREDIT
FOR YOUR SUCCESS,

18:13.900 --> 18:15.233
IT SHOULD BE ME.

18:15.233 --> 18:17.700
- ROBERT!
- THAT'S RIGHT! ADMIT IT!

18:17.700 --> 18:20.167
YOU OWE YOUR SUCCESS
TO THE PATHOLOGICAL DESIRE

18:20.167 --> 18:22.433
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD
TO BE BETTER THAN ME!

18:22.433 --> 18:24.400
- WHAT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.600
REMEMBER IN SCHOOL?
I WAS THE WRITER ON THE PAPER.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.800
BEFORE YOU EVEN KNEW
HOW TO PICK UP A PENCIL,

18:29.800 --> 18:31.633
I HAD MY OWN COLUMN.

18:31.633 --> 18:33.600
"THE VIEW FROM UP HERE."

18:37.033 --> 18:40.167
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME!

18:40.167 --> 18:43.033
- WELL, IT MAKES AS MUCH SENSE
AS A FAKE SMILE.

18:43.033 --> 18:45.300
- WHAT?
- OH...

18:45.300 --> 18:48.667
YOU DON'T WHITEN
YOUR TEETH?

18:48.667 --> 18:50.767
- HEY, ALL YOU DID
WAS TEACH HIM PIANO.

18:50.767 --> 18:52.500
IF IT WAS UP TO YOU,
RAY'D HAVE A JOB

18:52.500 --> 18:55.600
PLAYING "LOVE STORY"
NEXT TO A PERFUME COUNTER.

18:57.933 --> 18:59.733
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, YOU ALL HAD
YOUR CHANCE WITH RAY,

18:59.733 --> 19:02.133
AND YOU GOT HIM
AS FAR AS "FUTON GUY."

19:02.133 --> 19:04.200
MAYBE I TOOK HIM
THE REST OF THE WAY.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.533
- THAT IS ABSURD!

19:05.533 --> 19:07.233
- YOU CAN TAKE CREDIT
FOR THE BOY.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.467
I'LL TAKE CREDIT
FOR THE MAN.

19:08.467 --> 19:09.933
- YOU CAN HAVE CREDIT
FOR THE MAN.

19:09.933 --> 19:11.600
WHO THE HELL
WOULD WANT THAT?

19:11.600 --> 19:15.267
I JUST WANT CREDIT
FOR THE CAREER.

19:15.267 --> 19:18.767
- SO YOU JUST CAST ASIDE
THE MOTHER.

19:18.767 --> 19:21.600
LET ME TELL YOU--
IT DIDN'T START WITH A SMILE.

19:21.600 --> 19:26.567
IT STARTED WITH 19 HOURS
OF HORRIBLE LABOR.

19:29.167 --> 19:33.633
- BUT BEFORE THAT,
THERE WAS A SMILE.

19:41.933 --> 19:46.233
- ALSO HORRIBLE.

19:46.233 --> 19:49.500
- I WANT MY CREDIT.
I DESERVE IT!

19:49.500 --> 19:51.367
- DID YOU SEE
THE NEWSPAPER TODAY?

19:51.367 --> 19:53.033
- OH, IT'S
A TERRIBLE NEWSPAPER.

19:53.033 --> 19:54.400
[all talking at once]

19:54.400 --> 19:56.167
- ALL RIGHT,
STOP IT.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.733
STOP IT!
STOP IT!

19:57.733 --> 20:01.367
NOTHING'S EVER ENOUGH
FOR ANYBODY IN THIS HOUSE!

20:01.367 --> 20:03.567
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
YOU WANT...

20:03.567 --> 20:05.533
OKAY, HERE IT IS.
HERE IT IS. YOU READY?

20:05.533 --> 20:09.467
EVERYBODY?

20:09.467 --> 20:12.700
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.233
THANK YOU, ROBERT.

20:14.233 --> 20:16.500
I OWE MY CAREER
TO YOU.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.400
THAT COLUMN YOU DID
IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL

20:18.400 --> 20:20.333
ABOUT NOOGIES
VERSUS WEDGIES,

20:20.333 --> 20:24.767
THAT'S THE REASON
THAT I GO TO WORK EVERY DAY.

20:24.767 --> 20:28.133
AND, AMY...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID

20:28.133 --> 20:29.600
BEFORE YOU CAME
INTO THIS FAMILY

20:29.600 --> 20:32.633
TO POINT OUT MY MISTAKES,
BUT THANK YOU!

20:32.633 --> 20:34.733
AND, DAD!

20:34.733 --> 20:36.633
DAD, THERE'S SOMETHING
I ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY TO YOU.

20:36.633 --> 20:40.300
I'VE NEVER SAID IT BEFORE,
BUT I'M GONNA SAY IT RIGHT NOW!

20:40.300 --> 20:45.367
YOU ARE THE MOLE
ON THE BACKSIDE OF MY SUCCESS.

20:58.233 --> 21:02.967
SWEET MAMA.

21:02.967 --> 21:05.133
WITHOUT YOUR PUSHING,

21:05.133 --> 21:08.000
I WOULD STILL BE
IN YOUR WOMB.

21:19.067 --> 21:21.100
AND YOU, WIFE...

21:21.100 --> 21:23.600
WITHOUT YOU,

21:23.600 --> 21:26.467
I'D HAVE NOTHING
BUT HEART-ACHA-CHUH.

21:36.900 --> 21:41.333
- HE THANKED ME FIRST.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.633
- HE SAVED ME FOR LAST.

21:43.633 --> 21:48.600
- HE SAID THE MOST
MEANINGFUL THINGS ABOUT ME.

21:48.600 --> 21:52.700
- WHY WAS HE SO FRUITY?
