00:31.152 --> 00:33.778

00:33.896 --> 00:36.647

00:37.834 --> 00:39.935

<i>No boundaries, no borders.</i>

00:44.467 --> 00:46.000
<i>They will come for me,</i>

Pay up!

04:26.302 --> 04:27.744
- Now!
- Pay for what?

04:27.769 --> 04:31.020
For turning my life into an episode of
<i>Latin America's Most Wanted.</i>

04:31.067 --> 04:34.776
The biggest mob in the territory
thinks I was in on your little score.

04:34.801 --> 04:37.560
Whoa. Where the hell's
my stuff?

04:37.825 --> 04:38.540
Gone.

by your dazzling prick.

04:56.642 --> 04:59.292
- Twenty grand.
- I-I gave it to my partner.

- First you get clean...

05:13.617 --> 05:14.827

- What's this?
- A receipt.

06:25.481 --> 06:28.410
For two headstones and two plots
I squared away this morning.

06:28.578 --> 06:31.438
It's just a matter of time before
the Rangers sent me your bodies.

06:31.992 --> 06:35.606
I called in a lot of favors to
get you a nice spot, on a hill.

06:35.945 --> 06:39.088
You can see the Mother Bayou and
everything from there. It's beautiful.

06:40.461 --> 06:41.778
You owe me six grand.

06:43.626 --> 06:44.549
Eh...

Too much Mexican.

06:57.660 --> 06:58.975
Fiery car crash?

06:59.348 --> 07:02.686
Only that HAL-9000 brain of yours
could have worked it out.

07:03.135 --> 07:05.221
I got to tell you, all that
shit's just a movie trope.

07:05.246 --> 07:08.292
It does not work in the real world,
even if you do burn the bodies.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.564
It does if you match the dental work.

07:12.012 --> 07:12.726
Ahh.

07:12.811 --> 07:15.031
Open the pod bay doors, baby.

07:15.775 --> 07:18.602
Please tell me you're here to share
some of that cool 30 million

07:18.627 --> 07:20.058
with you dear old Uncle Eddie

07:20.083 --> 07:22.949
No, we lost it. Our fence
wasn't on the up-and-up.

07:22.974 --> 07:25.299
I can hook you and your brother up.
Where is Seth anyway?

07:26.021 --> 07:26.936
I don't know.

07:30.629 --> 07:31.863
That is smart, too.

07:31.888 --> 07:35.307
Stay separated. That way they can't put you
together in case one of you get caught.

07:37.652 --> 07:39.858
- I'll make a cup of Joe you want some?
- No, thanks.

07:39.883 --> 07:41.611
What's the matter, afraid it'll keep
you up all night?

07:42.751 --> 07:44.157
I'm up all night anyways.

07:44.182 --> 07:48.268
This ain't mountain-grown shit. These are
magic beans from Indo-fuckin'-nesia.

07:48.627 --> 07:50.205
Got a funny way of picking them over there.

07:50.275 --> 07:51.675
You got these monkeys everywhere,

07:51.700 --> 07:54.087
running around eating all the
red berries off the trees.

07:54.222 --> 07:56.346
The beans move through
their digestive tract.

07:56.370 --> 07:59.148
suppose to add flavour, and then
they sell the shit to fools like me,

07:59.173 --> 08:01.267
that got nothing better to do then
to perfect their brew.

08:01.292 --> 08:04.020
I gotta tell you, might come
out of the poop shoot...

08:05.281 --> 08:09.857
but you get hints of vanilla, all-spice,
forest floor. It's good shit.

08:09.919 --> 08:10.953
I'm gonna pass.

08:11.453 --> 08:13.631
I need a favor. Do you know Nathan Blanchard?

08:13.656 --> 08:15.945
- Why do you want mixed up with him for?
- Do you know him or not?

08:15.970 --> 08:18.282
I know him, I help him with
his collections sometimes,

08:18.307 --> 08:19.924
but let me tell you: he's a pimp.

08:19.962 --> 08:21.524
Nothing but a class A scumbag.

08:21.549 --> 08:23.955
- You got no reason to get mixed up with him.
- I know what I'm getting into.

08:23.980 --> 08:26.735
Then why you doing it? Your know
your father did the same thing.

08:26.760 --> 08:30.268
He went all entrepreneurial and shit.
That was the beginning of the end.

08:30.293 --> 08:32.188
- For him, not you.
- Want do you want,

08:32.212 --> 08:34.158
- you want a score, I get you a play
- I don't want a play

08:34.212 --> 08:36.143
What I want is for you to make
a phone call.

08:36.168 --> 08:37.553
How come you can't do that for me?

08:38.587 --> 08:40.480
Where's your brother?
He still in Mexico?

08:40.481 --> 08:41.072
I knew it!

08:41.260 --> 08:42.948
I fucking knew it! Why do I...

08:43.041 --> 08:44.034
Why do I even bother?

08:44.035 --> 08:46.981
You don't think I can do anything
without him, and you never did!

08:47.067 --> 08:49.092
Wait a second, it's not that at all.

08:50.042 --> 08:51.262
You and your brother

08:51.543 --> 08:53.489
Your the best I've ever seen.

08:53.514 --> 08:54.474
The best!

08:54.723 --> 08:56.163
He's the ace,
you're the wild card.

- Together you make a beautiful hand.
- Things changed in Mexico.

09:00.337 --> 09:01.665
I got the edge now.

09:02.054 --> 09:04.173
- I'm a new man.
- And I'm an old one.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.101
Let me tell you something Richard,
Life is shorter than you think.

09:07.148 --> 09:10.601
You go around burning bridges, you're gonna
end up all alone on a island, like me.

09:11.570 --> 09:14.151
- I just want an intro.
- I don't see why I should help ya.

09:17.483 --> 09:19.807
'Cause you know what it is
to be always number two.

Yeah, I got her.
I'll bring her home.

Sorry to bug you.
Is, uh, is he home?

14:31.589 --> 14:34.052
I was needing to pick up
a piece of evidence.

You two playing Ranger/convict
and you didn't call me?

14:48.756 --> 14:50.569
It was supposed to be a surprise.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.206
I guess the surprise is on me.

14:55.774 --> 14:58.182
Well, who doesn't like surprises?

15:02.713 --> 15:04.252
[Margaret] What's this about again Tony?

15:04.277 --> 15:07.925
It's an ancient artifact he got from
a museum up at Alamo State.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.546
It's an old piece of paper, it's very old.

15:10.855 --> 15:12.610
It folds like an accordion.

15:13.019 --> 15:14.515
Don't know anything about that.

Look, this really isn't a good time.

Let me poke around a minute.
I'll be out of your hair.

15:21.826 --> 15:23.413
There's your Alamo State
right there.

15:23.712 --> 15:26.979
- Professor Perv.
- Professor Perv?

15:27.004 --> 15:29.674
Yeah, Freddie said some girls filed
complaints against him.

15:30.145 --> 15:31.826
Been doing it for years,
nothing comes of it.

Well, you know sometimes them
little coeds are asking for it,

15:39.310 --> 15:42.430
with their little short shorts
and their upright titties.

15:43.467 --> 15:45.704
Antonio, is that really necessary?

15:46.196 --> 15:46.973
Oh, um...

15:46.998 --> 15:47.719
[clears throat]

15:47.744 --> 15:49.842
I'm sorry, um...

15:51.089 --> 15:52.121
Margaret.

15:52.146 --> 15:55.616
Does... does he keep
his stuff anywhere else?

15:55.648 --> 15:59.350
He'll be home any minute Tony.
You can ask him all about it.

15:59.539 --> 16:03.066
You know what? No.
I'm going to wait outside.

16:03.091 --> 16:06.786
I'll wait outside. And it'll be
another nice surprise.

16:06.811 --> 16:10.347
- Wait. Sit. I'll make some coffee.
- No, it's okay.

16:10.372 --> 16:13.395
No, it's not. I'm being a terrible host.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.282
Please, sit.

16:17.923 --> 16:19.881
I'm really worried
about him, Tony.

16:20.292 --> 16:23.627
He's not sleeping
and he's always on edge.

16:23.676 --> 16:27.114
Look at this place. He put these
freakin' shutters up everywhere.

16:27.382 --> 16:29.373
Makes me roll 'em down
at sundown.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.429
And he has these weapons.

16:32.921 --> 16:35.851
They're hidden all over the house, and he
thinks I don't know about them.

16:36.234 --> 16:37.549
It scares me.

16:38.202 --> 16:39.276
Weapons, huh?

16:39.549 --> 16:41.105
First I thought it was a hobby,

16:41.374 --> 16:44.428
then I found a duffle bag of wooden
sticks in a clothes closet.

16:44.647 --> 16:46.737
Sharp, like knives.

16:46.818 --> 16:49.421
- He's making more in the garage.
- Crafty.

16:49.571 --> 16:51.304
He wakes up in a cold sweat

16:51.358 --> 16:54.279
and starts jotting
strange stuff in his notebook.

16:54.634 --> 16:56.820
It all started when he came
back from Mexico.

16:57.445 --> 16:59.028
Something happened
to him down there.

16:59.114 --> 17:04.137
Sounds like your husband's radio is tuned to a
different frequency than the rest of ours.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.085
You got anything to eat
around here?

17:14.075 --> 17:15.708
I'm kind of famished.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.994
I have one question for you, amigo.

17:50.732 --> 17:52.368
Where is your brother?

17:53.882 --> 17:55.418
[chuckles softly]

17:58.640 --> 18:00.590
[audible exertion]

18:01.694 --> 18:03.744

18:10.134 --> 18:11.272
[Seth groans]

18:12.095 --> 18:13.298
[groaning]

18:27.420 --> 18:28.590
You didn't see him?

18:29.163 --> 18:31.944
- See who? Come on, get up.
- That guy.

18:32.207 --> 18:32.914
Get up.

18:34.051 --> 18:35.032
Come on.

18:42.456 --> 18:44.327
- Oh, fuck.
- Stop it.

18:44.419 --> 18:45.955
Why can't you get me any?

18:48.035 --> 18:49.851
My fucking head
is going to explode.

18:50.541 --> 18:52.463
- Ease down.
- Just give me a little.

18:52.525 --> 18:55.134
Just listen to me.
Give me some, okay?

18:55.159 --> 18:57.159
- Ease down.
- Stop it.

18:57.849 --> 18:58.989
I'm on the clock here.

18:59.014 --> 19:02.516
No. No, you're not.
You're not on anything, Seth.

19:03.304 --> 19:04.119
Okay?

19:04.242 --> 19:07.517
- Just keep coming. It's a short walk.
- Yeah.

19:08.643 --> 19:11.394
I'll be here waiting
on the other side of it.

19:14.151 --> 19:15.136
I'm on the clock.

19:36.806 --> 19:37.608
No.

19:44.012 --> 19:44.918
The gun.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.370
[hammer clicking]

20:08.546 --> 20:09.555
Oh, my God.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.145
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

20:13.703 --> 20:14.827
I'm all right.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.065
I'm so sorry.

20:16.794 --> 20:19.149
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

20:26.880 --> 20:27.911
Stay with me.

20:28.747 --> 20:30.366
What do you have for me here?

20:31.630 --> 20:32.584
Oh, yeah.

20:32.950 --> 20:35.499
I'll all take 'em, if you can
get 'em here by Friday.

20:36.325 --> 20:38.472
I can't use 'em
after Friday, Jimmy.

20:38.817 --> 20:40.320
I'm... I'm not...

20:40.872 --> 20:41.899
Thank you, baby.

20:42.304 --> 20:43.002
No.

20:43.037 --> 20:45.214
No it's got to be here
by Friday, man.

20:45.490 --> 20:46.278
Hang on.

20:46.303 --> 20:49.337
Can I get you a snack or something?
You look like you could use it man.

20:49.429 --> 20:50.369
No, thanks.

20:51.210 --> 20:52.248
Have a seat.

20:52.827 --> 20:54.143
Call me back, man.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.143
[phone beeping]

20:56.062 --> 20:57.984
I'll get right to it,
Mr. Blanchard.

20:58.069 --> 21:01.439
My name is Richard Sanz.
I'm not a flesh trader.

21:01.706 --> 21:04.574
Mostly I boost merch
and transport cargo.

21:04.659 --> 21:08.853
Recently acquired a truck, so happens
it was filled with precious goods.

21:10.315 --> 21:12.899
- Immigrant girls.
- Uh-oh.

21:13.002 --> 21:16.892
I'm a fan of research. I looked into
the trade and I like the returns.

21:17.539 --> 21:20.932
I got to thinking, with my
connections south of the border,

21:21.617 --> 21:23.937
I might be able to make
this happen on the regular.

21:24.763 --> 21:26.229
So I reached out to Eddie.

21:26.763 --> 21:28.004
He mentioned your name.

21:28.443 --> 21:33.713
Question is, are you
interested in a new supplier?

21:38.076 --> 21:39.275
[camera whirrs]

21:39.411 --> 21:41.694
[music plays softly]

22:00.098 --> 22:01.881
[music playing]

22:02.267 --> 22:05.296
Pretty. What do you tell them
they're going to be nannies?

22:05.297 --> 22:06.803
I don't have to tell them anything.

22:06.922 --> 22:09.508
As soon as the cross, they think they're
going to meet the man of their dreams,

22:09.508 --> 22:10.888
and... wife them up.

22:10.889 --> 22:11.721
[chuckles]

22:12.750 --> 22:14.137
How much would you pay for these?

22:15.281 --> 22:17.786
Oh, ten, twenty.
For one.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.447
Depending on her looks.

22:21.502 --> 22:24.048
I hear that some of
these girls don't get rented,

22:24.539 --> 22:25.806
they get bought.

22:27.858 --> 22:28.918
How much then?

22:31.468 --> 22:32.820
Who told you that? Eddie?

22:33.007 --> 22:34.228
Research.

22:35.767 --> 22:40.250
You have an exclusive relationship with
a very connected, very close-knit crowd

22:40.478 --> 22:41.743
from down south.

22:43.293 --> 22:46.977
They like to stay in the shadows,
and they like the very best flesh.

22:47.074 --> 22:50.138
We make this deal, you won't have
to troll the Mexican hoochie circuit

22:50.163 --> 22:53.654
and cherry-pick from the leftovers,
'cause I got your cherries right here.

23:02.571 --> 23:04.166
Do you know why I drink this shit?

23:04.462 --> 23:07.978
It ain't the taste,
of that I can assure you.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.467
I'm looking after my body, man.

23:10.969 --> 23:14.289
Same reason I always trying
to perfect my <i>ustrasana</i>

23:14.314 --> 23:16.978
and <i> padahastasana.</i> if that's right?

23:17.861 --> 23:19.387
They all sound the same to me.

23:20.471 --> 23:22.362
Body's your temple, right?

23:22.721 --> 23:25.487
What's a temple for?
Worship.

23:25.511 --> 23:26.284
Huh?

23:26.567 --> 23:29.106
My clients they come
into my establishment,

23:29.131 --> 23:32.311
they see the pleasures I provide,

23:32.357 --> 23:36.925
and they worship at the
altar of me, my friend.

23:37.025 --> 23:41.247
They see that I'm a conscientious
man who takes care of them,

23:41.272 --> 23:44.482
but, more importantly,
takes care of himself.

23:44.670 --> 23:47.189
They think, that Nathan Blanchard,

23:47.588 --> 23:49.934
he's solid as a Bob Seger song.

23:50.643 --> 23:53.183
Great hook, two strong verses,

23:53.463 --> 23:55.350
and a bridge
that brings it home.

23:55.797 --> 23:57.875
He makes good choices.

23:58.299 --> 24:00.994
Maybe when I walk out that door,
you hit the Bombay Sapphire.

24:01.019 --> 24:03.676
Maybe, which is why
I gotta ask you:

24:03.877 --> 24:07.750
You come in here, you say that you're all
carrot juice and wheat grass,

24:07.775 --> 24:10.936
how do I know you're not
really PBR and pork rinds?

24:11.408 --> 24:18.298
I'm offering you choice goods, handled with
care. No bruises, no broken bones, handpicked.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.239
For that, I want 50%.

24:20.995 --> 24:22.641
- Okay.
- You can say yes...

24:22.666 --> 24:25.686
or you can go sit down with
the cartels and try it yourself.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.769
I'll even give you my contact.

24:28.104 --> 24:29.802
But you wanna bring extra pair of rocks,

24:29.827 --> 24:32.661
just in case the ones you have
don't make it back across the border

24:32.931 --> 24:33.873
[chuckles]

24:36.346 --> 24:37.953
My rocks will be fine.

24:39.340 --> 24:40.338
I'll tell you what.

24:42.020 --> 24:43.372
You bring me a shipment...

24:44.543 --> 24:46.136
we'll talk percentages.

24:46.564 --> 24:47.715
Done and done.

25:01.672 --> 25:05.381
Follow him. Make him understand
who he's dealing with.

How much are you going
to make when he fucks me?

25:26.112 --> 25:29.332
No one is gonna touch you.
Now get in the cage.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.141
Or what?

25:38.430 --> 25:40.084
Or he will touch you.

25:40.876 --> 25:43.005
Many men will have their way with you.

25:43.407 --> 25:45.417
And I won't be there to protect you.

25:46.329 --> 25:48.825
So if you listen and do as I say,

25:49.577 --> 25:51.652
you'll help me destroy those men.

25:52.830 --> 25:56.947
Now get in the fucking cage.

26:01.010 --> 26:03.677
What...
what did he do to you?

26:22.908 --> 26:24.498
He taught me how to dance.

26:26.697 --> 26:29.914
And then... what happened?

26:33.254 --> 26:34.858
He thought I would do it forever.

26:36.707 --> 26:38.180
What he didn't know...

26:39.844 --> 26:41.760
is that he'd given me
a strength.

26:44.026 --> 26:45.102
A power.

26:46.851 --> 26:49.332
The same power I'm going to use...

26:49.926 --> 26:52.885
to tear him limb from limb.

26:54.011 --> 26:56.058
Is that the power you gave me?

26:56.894 --> 26:59.707
To destroy anyone who threatens me?

27:01.941 --> 27:03.699
I just gave you a taste.

27:05.870 --> 27:06.831
A taste.

27:10.703 --> 27:12.436
Would you like a taste?

It's a relief to let
a little moonlight in.

Sweet Jesus on a pogo stick.

I didn't know people
still made Frito pie.

If we don't keep up our
traditions, they'll die.

has been completely...

You know, You're right.

28:38.710 --> 28:39.904
Thanks for coming by.

- [Margaret] "In here"?

28:49.671 --> 28:50.588
What's that, babe?

First thing you said, "What are you
doing <i> in here?"</i>

- Oh, we are doing this.

Right here, right now.

You think you can lock
me and Billy in here

29:08.410 --> 29:10.026

kind of a prison?

29:10.051 --> 29:12.042
Okay, listen.

29:12.127 --> 29:16.543
Why do you just hand me over whatever it is
you got at the professor's house.

29:16.752 --> 29:19.266
That way I can process it
down at the lab.

29:22.125 --> 29:23.271

I didn't tell you I went to Tanner's house,

29:44.829 --> 29:46.429

29:46.954 --> 29:49.701
They got to you, or you're not you.

29:49.995 --> 29:52.185

- That's not Tony.
- See, what you're seeing is eh...

30:09.639 --> 30:11.721
how do I explain this?
It's eh..

Officer Mendoza's soul,

onto your mind.
