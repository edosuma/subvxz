00:08.240 --> 00:10.380
I today announce my intention

00:10.480 --> 00:14.180
to nominate United States
Court of Appeals Judge Robert H. Bork

00:14.280 --> 00:16.379
to be an Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.960
The drumbeat continued today
from both camps

00:19.080 --> 00:21.220
in the pitched battle
over the President's nomination

00:21.320 --> 00:23.340
of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.060
The lobbying is having an effect

00:25.160 --> 00:27.500
with the Senate mailroom
reported days behind

00:27.600 --> 00:29.980
under a deluge of mail on Bork.

00:30.080 --> 00:34.020

Bork nomination will fail in the Committee.

The yeas are 42. The nays are 58.
The nomination is not confirmed.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.980
If we intend to turn
the United States Supreme Court

00:47.080 --> 00:50.460
into an election process,
let's change the Constitution,

00:50.560 --> 00:53.291
and let's elect a Supreme Court judge
of the United States.

00:54.080 --> 00:57.820
I, George Herbert Walker Bush,
do solemnly swear

00:57.920 --> 01:03.380
that I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States.

REPORTER: Thurgood Marshall,
the Supreme Court's

01:05.360 --> 01:06.740
first and only black justice,

01:06.840 --> 01:09.161
announced his retirement today,

01:10.080 --> 01:11.900
In a letter to President Bush, Marshall said,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.980
"The strenuous demands
of court work appear at this time

01:15.080 --> 01:18.289
"to be incompatible with
my advancing age and medical condition."

01:20.680 --> 01:22.740

said today his nomination

01:22.840 --> 01:25.420
to replace retiring
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall

01:25.520 --> 01:29.081
could come in a few days,
but should that person be black?

01:29.240 --> 01:31.420
MALE REPORTER 2: A minority appointment
could certainly neutralize

01:31.520 --> 01:33.100
a lot of potential opposition.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.420
FEMALE REPORTER 2:
Marshall warned that the emphasis on race

01:35.520 --> 01:39.180
in choosing his successor
might have negative results.

01:39.280 --> 01:44.411
My dad told me way back
that you can't use race.

01:45.520 --> 01:49.340
For example, there's no difference
between a white snake and a black snake.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.500
- They'll both bite.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.940
We are told the President
is going to announce

01:54.040 --> 01:56.260
his nominee to the Supreme Court.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.140
Well, I am very pleased to announce

01:59.240 --> 02:02.140
that I will nominate Judge Clarence Thomas

02:02.240 --> 02:05.687
to serve as Associate Justice
of the United States Supreme Court.

02:06.120 --> 02:10.180
Clarence Thomas fits my description
of the best man at the right time.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.380
BERNARD SHAW: President Bush has
moved to cement the conservative majority

02:13.480 --> 02:15.620
on the United States Supreme Court

02:15.720 --> 02:17.180
by nominating federal judge Clarence Thomas

02:17.280 --> 02:20.700
to fill the seat left vacant by the
retirement of Justice Thurgood Marshall.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.500
As with Marshall, Thomas is a black man,

02:23.600 --> 02:26.140
a man born to poverty in a segregated South,

02:26.240 --> 02:30.020
a man who benefited from
the legal legacy of Justice Marshall.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.620
The more that people see
and hear of Clarence Thomas,

02:32.720 --> 02:35.820
the more they will be persuaded
that his brand of integrity

02:35.920 --> 02:37.500
and independence and common sense

02:37.600 --> 02:39.602
is exactly what we need in this time.

MALE REPORTER 4: In New York City today,
several thousand demonstrators

02:42.960 --> 02:46.620
protested against the Supreme Court decision
restricting abortion counseling

02:46.720 --> 02:48.500
and urged Congress to reject

02:48.600 --> 02:51.500
President Bush's nomination of
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.460
Clarence Thomas is an insult

02:54.560 --> 02:57.340
to the life and legacy of Thurgood Marshall

02:57.440 --> 02:59.761
- and everything he stood and worked for.

of civil rights activists in Memphis,

03:03.600 --> 03:07.420
black leaders are vocal in their reaction
to the Supreme Court nominee.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.860
Simply to appoint a black person
doesn't make it right.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.220
We have to Bork Thomas.

03:13.320 --> 03:17.100
We don't wait for questions.
We simply immediately Bork him,

03:17.200 --> 03:20.602
kill him politically,
and kill Bush in the meantime.

we've been hearing all summer

about how Thomas treated women
who worked for him?

03:38.360 --> 03:40.840
- Yeah.
- I finally found a name.

03:41.440 --> 03:46.260
In 1946, a black woman
wanted to study law here

03:46.360 --> 03:48.620
at the University of Oklahoma.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.580
At the time, it was illegal
for blacks and whites

03:52.680 --> 03:56.526
to study together in this state,
so Miss Sipuel sued.

- ANITA: Nothing.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.300
You don't want to say anything?

04:04.400 --> 04:06.641
This man could end up on the Supreme Court.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.527
At the EEOC,
I saw women have their lives ruined

04:10.840 --> 04:13.660
because they spoke out against
a manager at a diner.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.842
What do you think would happen to me?

04:16.920 --> 04:18.365

seven of them vote against you.

At last count, we had 60.

number could even go up higher,

that common background

was one of the reasons he hired her
as his personal assistant 10 years ago.

According to Hill's affidavit,
Thomas soon began asking her out socially

19:19.440 --> 19:21.460
and refused to accept her explanation

19:21.560 --> 19:24.484
that she did not think it appropriate
to go out with her boss.

would, quote, "turn conversation to

having Anita Hill testify first, are you?

She's the one who made the claim.
She's asked to go first, so yes.

37:22.880 --> 37:26.180
She's already gone first.
She's told her story to the media.

37:26.280 --> 37:30.180
Her claims are out there,
and they are hanging over Clarence's head.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.340
That is exactly why in these proceedings,

37:32.440 --> 37:35.364
Clarence deserves the right
to speak first and clear his name.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.620
- So you're asking me to change the order?
- Yes, I am.

They switched the order.
They're gonna let Thomas testify first.

the order wasn't fair to Thomas.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.780

until I introduce them?

like this hours before we start.

as surely the whole country knows now,

38:32.840 --> 38:36.460
accused by Professor Anita Hill

from Judge Thomas in person all week,

denying all the charges against him.

The first I learned of the allegations
by Professor Anita Hill

42:10.680 --> 42:14.401
was on September 25th, 1991,

42:16.280 --> 42:18.931
when the FBI came to my home

42:20.640 --> 42:23.246
to investigate her allegations.

of the nature of the allegations

I was shocked, surprised,

that I said or did to Anita Hill

for sexual harassment.

that has been misconstrued

a proper, cordial, and professional one.

52:59.040 --> 53:02.726
When Judge Thomas was made
chair of the EEOC,

53:03.080 --> 53:06.801
I needed to face the question
of whether to go with him.

53:07.280 --> 53:10.887
I was asked to do so, and I did.

53:11.680 --> 53:14.047
The work itself was interesting

53:14.200 --> 53:16.340
and at that time it appeared

53:16.440 --> 53:21.162
that the sexual overtures
which had so troubled me had ended.

53:21.960 --> 53:26.727
However, during the fall and winter of 1982,

53:27.360 --> 53:28.646
these began again.

53:31.160 --> 53:36.326
One of the oddest episodes I remember
was an occasion

53:36.440 --> 53:40.047
in which Thomas was drinking a Coke
in his office.

53:42.360 --> 53:46.126
He got up from the table
at which we were working,

53:46.760 --> 53:50.321
went over to his desk to get a Coke,

53:51.120 --> 53:57.480
looked at the can, and asked,
"Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?"

53:59.760 --> 54:04.004
On other occasions,
he referred to the size of his own penis

54:04.480 --> 54:06.562
as being larger than normal,

54:06.680 --> 54:12.323
and he also spoke of the pleasures
he had given to women

54:14.200 --> 54:15.361
with oral sex.

54:16.880 --> 54:17.980
(SIGHS)

54:18.080 --> 54:22.927
Finally, he made a comment
that I will vividly remember.

54:24.280 --> 54:29.047
He said that if I ever told anyone
of his behavior,

54:29.160 --> 54:31.640
that it would ruin his career.

54:32.960 --> 54:37.260
I have no personal vendetta
against Clarence Thomas.

54:37.360 --> 54:40.700
I seek only to provide the Committee

54:40.800 --> 54:44.885
with information
which it may regard as relevant.

54:47.040 --> 54:50.886
It would have been more comfortable
to remain silent.

54:51.360 --> 54:54.489
I took no initiative to inform anyone,

54:55.040 --> 55:00.206
but when I was asked
by a representative of this Committee

55:01.200 --> 55:03.407
to report my experience,

55:05.280 --> 55:08.807
I felt that I had to tell the truth.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.449
I could not keep silent.

55:25.160 --> 55:27.049
There's no way he survives this day.

55:30.960 --> 55:33.780
JOE:
Professor, before I begin my questioning,

55:33.880 --> 55:36.451
I notice that you have
a number of people here.

55:36.560 --> 55:39.460
You've got friends or family
joining you here today?

55:39.560 --> 55:41.767
- My family hasn't arrived.
- (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

55:42.120 --> 55:45.940
They... I'm sorry.
They are here, but they're in the hall.

55:46.040 --> 55:48.300
We will make room for your family.

55:48.400 --> 55:50.846
- It's a very large family, Senator.
- (CHUCKLES)

55:51.200 --> 55:53.580
Well, let's...
Can we open those doors, please,

55:53.680 --> 55:55.660
- get Professor Hill's family in here?
- (DOOR OPENING)

55:55.760 --> 55:57.780
If we can clear some of these chairs here.

55:57.880 --> 56:00.540
If you're not essential,
maybe you can clear over here.

56:00.640 --> 56:01.687
Love you, baby.

56:03.200 --> 56:04.770
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

56:04.880 --> 56:05.881
JOE: Here you go.

56:11.920 --> 56:13.900
What's the backroom conversation
at the White House?

56:14.000 --> 56:16.940
I'm just speculating here, Peter.
It isn't over, and I don't know,

56:17.040 --> 56:19.500
but the sense that you get here,
although they won't say it publicly,

56:19.600 --> 56:20.931
is that they're pretty gloomy.

56:21.280 --> 56:25.540
By all means, let's get loving close-ups
of the salt-of-the-earth parents.

56:25.640 --> 56:26.620
That's not prejudicial.

56:26.720 --> 56:28.051
Is the President watching?

56:29.640 --> 56:34.328
He's still behind the guy? Okay, yeah.
Just making sure. All right.

56:34.760 --> 56:36.171
(LINE DISCONNECTS)

56:37.640 --> 56:38.641
I had to ask.

56:39.160 --> 56:41.140
JOE: I must ask you, Professor,

56:41.240 --> 56:45.700
to explain again
and more fully, if you would,

56:45.800 --> 56:49.740
the behavior that you have alleged,

56:49.840 --> 56:53.686
that you say went beyond, uh, professional,

56:54.360 --> 56:57.489
um, business practices.

56:58.360 --> 57:01.011
Did all that behavior take place at work?

57:01.680 --> 57:02.980
Yes, it did.

57:03.080 --> 57:06.100
And just in your own words, as best you can,

57:06.200 --> 57:09.100
can you tell the Committee
where each of these incidents

57:09.200 --> 57:11.540
that you mentioned in your opening statement

57:11.640 --> 57:13.165
took place specifically?

57:14.680 --> 57:16.300
Well, I recall specifically

57:16.400 --> 57:22.328
that the incident about the Coke can
occurred in his office at the EEOC.

57:22.520 --> 57:23.965
What incident was that?

57:26.520 --> 57:31.924
The incident with regard to the Coke can
that's spelled out in my statement.

57:32.360 --> 57:34.362
Okay, one more time again for me, please.

57:39.920 --> 57:45.882
The, (SIGHS), uh, incident involved him

57:46.720 --> 57:48.020
going to his desk...

57:48.120 --> 57:51.329
Getting up from a work table,
going to his desk,

57:53.320 --> 57:59.965
looking at a can, and saying,
"Who put pubic hair on my Coke?"

58:02.680 --> 58:08.722
And were there other incidents
that took place at the office?

58:11.080 --> 58:16.644
I recall at least one instance
in his office at the EEOC

58:16.760 --> 58:19.300
where he brought up the substance

58:19.400 --> 58:23.928
or the content of pornographic material.

58:24.280 --> 58:27.921
And again for the record,
what was the content of...

58:29.040 --> 58:30.246
What the hell is he doing?

58:30.440 --> 58:32.660
Does he think
people want to hear this trash again?

58:32.760 --> 58:38.642
...to an individual who had, um,
a very large penis

58:39.320 --> 58:43.609
and used the name that he was referred to

58:44.120 --> 58:46.500
in the pornographic material.

58:46.600 --> 58:48.523
- Um...
- JOE: Do you recall what that was?

58:49.560 --> 58:50.686
ANITA: I do.

58:55.080 --> 59:00.883
The name that was referred to
was Long Dong Silver.

59:01.240 --> 59:03.402
Jesus Christ Almighty.

59:06.160 --> 59:10.660
JOE: Can you tell the Committee here
what was the most embarrassing

59:10.760 --> 59:12.444
of all these alleged incidents?

59:13.600 --> 59:16.206
ANITA: I think the one
that was the most embarrassing

59:16.320 --> 59:19.820
was his descriptions of pornography

59:19.920 --> 59:23.860
involving women with large breasts

59:23.960 --> 59:30.620
engaged in a variety of sex
with different people or animals.

59:30.720 --> 59:32.900
That was the thing
that embarrassed me the most

59:33.000 --> 59:35.571
and made me feel the most humiliated.

59:35.680 --> 59:37.250
(CROWD MURMURING)

59:39.800 --> 59:41.660
Professor, I'm going to yield the floor now

59:41.760 --> 59:45.660
to my good friend from Pennsylvania,
Senator Specter.

59:45.760 --> 59:51.369
Professor Hill, you testified
that you drew an inference

59:51.480 --> 59:55.246
that Judge Thomas might want you
to look at pornographic films,

59:55.680 --> 01:00:00.402
but you told the FBI specifically that
he never asked you to watch the films.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.820
Is that correct?

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:08.740
He never said,
"Let's go to my apartment and watch films."

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:12.580
He did say,
"You ought to see this material."

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.287
But when you testified, as I wrote it down,

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.780
"We ought to look at
pornographic movies together,"

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.100
that was an expression
of what was in your mind.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.140
That was the inference that I drew, yes.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:30.060
What with his pressing me
for social engagements, yes.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.448
But the fact is flatly he never asked you
to look at pornographic movies with him?

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.880
With him?

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.408
- No, he did not.
- No, he did not.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.131
Professor Hill, you said you took it to mean

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.180
that Judge Thomas
wanted to have sex with you,

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.171
but, in fact, he never did ask you
to have sex, correct?

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.249
No, he never asked me to have sex.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.300
He did continually pressure me
to go out with him.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.007
He would not accept my explanation
as being valid.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.243
You think she should be more emotional?

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.660
If she were, we'd be saying
she should be less emotional.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.740
All right, all three networks
are going to stay live

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:11.980
as long as we're in session,

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.620
so if we can keep her talking
for a few more hours,

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.380
Clarence will have prime time all to himself.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.925
Call the Committee. Let them know.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:27.525
Professor Hill, what went
through your mind, if anything,

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.180
on whether you ought
to come forward at that stage?

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.420
If you had, you would have stopped this man
from being head of the EEOC.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.126
What went through your mind? (CHUCKLES)

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.940
How could you allow
this sort of reprehensible conduct

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.203
to go on right in the headquarters
without doing something about it?

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:52.340
I can only say that when I made the decision
to just withdraw from the situation

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.260
and not press a claim against him,

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.180
I may have shirked a duty,
a responsibility that I had.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.330
And to that extent,
I confess that I am very sorry

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:08.488
that I didn't do something or say something.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.380
But at the time, that was my best judgment.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.566
It may have been a poor judgment,
but it was not dishonest.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.530
It was not a completely unreasonable
choice given the circumstances.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.900
MALE REPORTER:
I think it really does underscore

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.740
the basic difference how men and women
look at this issue.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.340
I've had a number of occasions.
Did I report them? No.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.489
And for the same reasons you've heard
every other woman in this country state.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.568
There has been disclosed in the public
the records of certain telephone logs.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.580
You've been quoted
in The Washington Post as saying,

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.321
"Ms. Hill called the telephone logs garbage."

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.300
Have you seen the records
of the telephone logs, Professor Hill?

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.420
Yes, I have.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.220
Do you deny the accuracy of
these telephone logs?

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.300
No, I do not.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.940
Then you now concede that
you had called Judge Thomas 11 times?

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.044
I do not deny the accuracy of these logs.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.851
So they're not garbage.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:12.529
Senator, what I said was,
the issue is garbage.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.460
Those telephone messages do not indicate

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:21.329
that somehow I was pursuing something more
than a cordial relationship.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.087
A professional relationship.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.460
Each one of those calls was made
in a professional context.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.245
Several of those calls involved one incident

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.569
where I was trying to act
on behalf of another group.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:40.762
So the issue that is being created with
the telephone calls, yes, indeed is garbage.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:48.300
If what you say this man
said to you occurred,

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.340
why in God's name
when he left his position of power

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.180
or status or authority over you...

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:01.322
Why in God's name would you ever speak
to a man like that the rest of your life?

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.648
That's a very good question.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.211
And I am sure that I cannot answer it
to your satisfaction.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.771
That is one of the things
that I have tried to do here today,

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.162
I have suggested
that I was afraid of retaliation.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.485
I was afraid of damage
to my professional life.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.860
I believed that... You have to understand
that this kind of response is not atypical,

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.780
and I can't explain it.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.966
It takes an expert in psychology
to explain how that can happen.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.168
But it can happen.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.483
'Cause it happened to me.

Well done.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.660
MALE REPORTER:
But the fact of the matter is that

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.300
Anita Hill was a very compelling witness

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.482
who told in graphic detail

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.300
how she was sexually harassed
by Judge Thomas.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.820
There's a feeling here that, that this witness
has held up pretty well this afternoon,

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.460
and there has been
a sense of apprehension about it.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.846
- Here she is.

his work cut out for him tonight.

No shit. We got to do
everything we can to back him up.

- Everything.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Duberstein.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.260
I was asked to tell you that Senator Biden
decided to adjourn till tomorrow,

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.540
so they're not gonna need
Judge Thomas tonight.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.290
What? No fucking way. Move.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.220
- You are not adjourning.
- Ken, everybody is completely exhausted.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.620
- We had an agreement. Same news cycle, Joe.
- I already got a tooth that's killing me.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.529
This country's gonna hear
Clarence Thomas tonight.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.620
It's either gonna be in there
at the witness table

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.300
or parked right outside this door
explaining to a bank of television cameras

why Joe Biden is denying him
the right to defend himself.

Yes.

- How is he?
- Angry.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.326
He's confused.

unequivocally,

uncategorically...

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:37.580
That I deny each and every single allegation
against me today

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.083
that suggested that I, in any way,
had conversations

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.884
of a sexual nature

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:50.487

that I ever had any personal
sexual interest in her,

I think that this today is a travesty.

I think it is disgusting.

This is a circus. It's a national disgrace.

Thomas's performance last night.

They felt that the whole dynamic
of the hearing changed.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.780
John, did the White House
have a piece of this strategy?

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.660
Were they in on the idea of invoking race?

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.980
They were in on the idea.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.367
They knew exactly
what Clarence Thomas was going to say.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.771
CLARENCE: In this country,
when it comes to sexual conduct,

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.204
we still have underlying racial attitudes
about black men and their views on sex.

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.740
Once you pin that on me, I can't get it off.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.926
Anita Hill said he discussed
oral sex between men and women.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.300
Yes, I'm a client. Can you tell him I'm here?

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.900
But nobody in the Senate bothered telling me
where the hell I'm supposed to go.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.721
"Thomas liked to discuss specific sex acts
and frequency of sex."

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.780
Now that last... "Frequency."
That could have to do

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.860
with black men supposedly being
very promiscuous or something like that.

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.089
So it could be partially stereotypical?

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.340
Yes.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.602
Well, I'm concerned.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.088
Well, I was talking about these hearings
with a friend of mine,

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.380
and when I told him what I thought
as a mental health professional,

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:48.086
he said to me, "This is something
the senators need to hear."

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.140
- Doctor...
- And at first I was just flabbergasted,

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.642
but then halfway through her testimony,
it hit me.

Erotomania.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:02.140

- It's a psychiatric disorder.

PATRICK: Thank you, Judge.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.806
- MAN: Is your name Anita F. Hill?
- Yes.

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:39.529
Various psychiatrists have come forward
to state as a general principle,

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.128
not as a diagnosis of an individual
but as a general principle,

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:47.927
that there is a specific disorder.

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:52.610
So here is this foul stack of stench

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.840
justifiably offensive in any category,

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:01.081
and I ask you why, after she left his power,

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:04.324
or whatever it was that gave her fear

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.604
or revulsion or repulsion...

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:14.123
Why did she, twice after that,
visit personally with him in Tulsa, Oklahoma?

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:20.980
I get Christmas cards from people I don't see
from one end of the year to the other end

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.286
and do not wish to.

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:26.130
I also return their cards
and will return their calls.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.300
And these are people who have insulted me

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:32.370
and done things which perhaps
have been degrading at times.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.923
But these are the things
you have to put up with.

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:38.489
And being a black woman,
you have to put up with a lot.

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.446
So you grit your teeth, and you do it.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.011
- Senator Kennedy.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:55.169
Some people just don't want to believe you.

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:59.525
You have to understand
that they just don't want to believe you,

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.321
- and they don't want to believe Professor Hill.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.681

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:10.082
I hope that we're not going to hear
a lot more comments,

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:14.609
unworthy, unjustified comments

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:18.287
about fantasy stories picked out of books

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:22.286
and law cases
after we've heard from this panel.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.809
I hope we can clear this room of the dirt

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.209
and innuendo
about over-the-transom information.

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:33.860

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:37.660

on Professor Hill.

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.046
They're unworthy.

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:43.841
And quite frankly, I hope we're not going
to hear a lot more about racism

01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:46.122
as we consider this nominee.

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:51.322
Fact is that these points
of sexual harassment

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:55.811
are made by an Afro-American
against an Afro-American.

01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:00.289
The issue isn't discrimination and racism.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.805
It's about sexual harassment.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:10.608
And I hope we can keep our eye
on that particular issue.

CAROLE: Within the last few minutes,
we just found out

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:39.620
that Professor Anita Hill
has taken a polygraph test,

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:44.180
and according to the expert that
administered it to her, she passed it.

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:45.940
She offered to take a lie detector test.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.900
That's not the hallmark
of someone who's lying.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.660
FEMALE REPORTER: At a golf outing,
President Bush said he saw no reason

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:54.048
for either Hill or Judge Clarence Thomas
to take such a test.

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:59.660
I don't want to be in a position of advocating
that every nominee takes a lie detector test.

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.046
And I think it's a stupid idea.

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.364
JACK: Of course she'll pass a polygraph

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:07.851
because the disorder makes her believe
she is telling the truth.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:11.300
FEMALE REPORTER: Republicans complaining
bitterly that, as Orrin Hatch said,

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:14.980
you can find any polygraph tester
to produce any results you want.

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:19.404
He called it "the sleazy tactic
of a two-bit sleaze lawyer."

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.100
MALE REPORTER:
It seems to me that in the country

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.660
for that great band in the middle somewhere,

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:28.162
that their judgment swings
from session to session.

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.767
This afternoon,
Anita Hill's friends and supporters

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.180
made a very credible appearance.

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:35.100
Tonight, his friends and supporters
and coworkers

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.900
are making credible performances.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.731
He's a man of high moral standing,

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:42.088
and I tell you that it's not possible

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.980
that he could be linked
with the kinds of things

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.740
that have been alleged against him here.

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:50.322
I have known Judge Clarence Thomas
for more than 30 years,

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:56.300
and I find the allegations by Miss Hill
not only ludicrous but totally inconsistent,

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:59.260
and in opposite to his principles
and his personality.

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:03.843
She played the role of a meek, innocent,
shy Baptist girl from the South

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.540
who was a victim of this big bad man.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:10.020
Chairman Thomas
that I have known for 10 years

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:14.603
is absolutely incapable
of the abuses described by Professor Hill.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.220
In my case,

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:20.420
she had fantasized about my being
interested in her romantically.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.806
Et tu, Brutus?

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:24.005
You, too, Anita?

on the nomination of

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.140
Judge Clarence Thomas continue

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:32.580
and are expected
to go on long into the night.

Tomorrow, Professor Anita Hill
and Judge Clarence Thomas

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:37.940
have been invited back
to wrap up their testimony,

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:43.100
Extraordinary is a word that may be
not quite strong enough, Carole.

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.780
This thing has ground on now for hours
through the day and into the night.

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:48.700
Some Republican senators are still trying

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.060
to prevent the Committee from hearing
testimony from another witness

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.060
who's come forward against Thomas.

At first, we thought it was going to be

01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.300
a national encounter on sexual harassment.

01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.740
And now it has turned ugly.

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:03.740
It's almost a murder-suicide pact
between Democrats and Republicans.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.604
Just no one wins.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.780
I talked to Joel Paul.

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:11.220
He's been getting threatening phone calls,
and he's worried he won't get tenure.

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.641
Because he was a character witness for me?

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:15.527
Yes.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.260
If we can get Thomas's porn rental records,
I say we get them.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:29.700
- Absolutely not, no.
- Joe, this is a dirty fight.

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.980
There's no second place.
If we don't win, we lose.

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.320
At what cost, Patrick?

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:36.620
I'm getting calls into my office.
Hundreds an hour.

on the Supreme Court.

to uphold the dignity

of the United States Senate.

it is that no one likes what's going on

one or two more by Tuesday,

your willingness to participate.

"Willingness"? I was subpoenaed.

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.740
While it is Chairman Biden's desire
that you testify,

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:33.060
the time constraints we find ourselves under
are making that impossible.

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:35.481
"Time constraints"?
I've been here a day and a half.

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:39.091
So the chairman would like
to withdraw your subpoena.

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:42.848
He will enter your deposition
into the written record unrebutted.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.769

so they really do run out of time.

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:21.730
that expressions of approval
or disapproval are prohibited.

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:26.444
The question is on the confirmation of the
nomination of Clarence Thomas of Georgia

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:30.247
to be an Associate Justice
of the United States Supreme Court.

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.885
The clerk will call the roll.

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:34.044
- MAN: Mr. Adams.
- ADAMS: No.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.968
- MAN: Mr. Akaka.

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.820
- MAN: Mr. Baucus.
- BAUCUS: No.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.968
- MAN: Mr. Bentsen.
- BENTSEN: No.

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.801
- MAN: Mr. Biden.
- JOE: No.

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:47.089
- MAN: Mr. Bingaman.
- BINGAMAN: No.

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.284
- MAN: Mr. Bond.
- BOND: Aye.

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.761
Hey.

01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:13.571
Welcome home.

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.480
Thank you.

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:18.845
Is this all...

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.645
For you? Yup.

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.606
All of it.

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:49.561
What's it say?

01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.163
"Dear Professor Hill,

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.606
"For 25 years, I've been a cashier.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:07.488
"All that time, my boss has treated me
like his personal property.

01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.890
"I never said anything,
not even to my husband.

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:13.620
"It's been really scary and lonely,

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:19.011
"but watching you this week felt like
I was watching someone standing up for me.

01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:23.130
"So thank you.

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:26.481
"Sincerely, Elisa Nelson."

01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:30.241
SHIRLEY: Wow.

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.531
(CRYING)

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:56.565
- MAN: Mr. Wellstone.
- No.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:59.005
- MAN: Mr. Wirth.
- WIRTH: No.

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:02.371
- MAN: Mr. Wofford.
- WOFFORD: No.

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:12.525
The yeas are 52, and the nays are 48.

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:15.008
The nomination of
Clarence Thomas of Georgia

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.540
to be Associate Justice
of the United States Supreme Court

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:20.449
is hereby confirmed.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.761
Clarence.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:47.165
It's good news.

01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:31.200
WOMAN: It was not too long ago

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:34.642
that a colleague of mine
complimented me on my appearance

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:38.180
and then said that he was going to
chase me around the House floor.

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:41.060
MALE REPORTER: The last time the federal
government polled all its workers,

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:44.940
42% of the women reported
they had been recently sexually harassed.

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.644
So, Hal, tell us what happens now.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.688
Well, what happens now is we've got
a political issue for the 1992 campaign.

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:54.180
Two percent may be good for milk,

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:56.620
but it ain't good
for the United State Senate.

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:59.740
FEMALE REPORTER: What's different this
year is the record number of women

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.286
running and winning up and down the ticket.

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:07.820
One factor there and elsewhere is backlash
over the Senate's treatment of Anita Hill.

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:11.140
A woman's voice does not count
in America today.

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:13.660
I have not been sexually harassed,

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:17.003
but I have been very obviously
discriminated against.

01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:19.220
Happened something like 20 years ago.

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.721
- But you're aware that women also...
- Wait. Wait, Sam!

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:24.820
I remember every word of it.

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:27.700
If we stay mad about
Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill,

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:29.928
we'll never remember our lines.

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:34.926
Oh... Please.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.620
Sir, would you please state your name?

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.722
Long Dong Silver.

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.020
The rules of the old boys' club
that prevailed in this hearing

01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:47.580
are simply not going to work anymore.

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.604
MALE REPORTER: The Senate
Judiciary Committee is getting diversity,

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.460
Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois
and California's Dianne Feinstein

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.005
have been assigned to the panel.

01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.980
Women for the first time
in my lifetime have said

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.340
we are players in this society,
and we intend to stay that way.

01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:06.780
On Thursday, President Bush signed
a long-awaited civil rights bill.

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:10.140
MALE REPORTER: ...which will make it much
easier for women and minorities

01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:11.660
to sue for discrimination...

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:13.620
...and harassment on the job.

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:16.940
MAN: It does not have to be
a physical touch or a specific threat.

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:21.660
Companies now produce videos explaining
it can be any unwanted sexual advances.

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:25.220
A bill to combat violence against women
was introduced in the US Senate.

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.540
You should have the civil rights protection
as well as the criminal laws protection.

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:34.060
This has become a national teacher
on the issue of sexual harassment.

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:37.180
I just think that you're getting caught up
in the politics of it

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:40.940
when what you're forgetting is that
there's a human being, a woman involved.

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.980
- There's a man, too.
- MAN: Okay.

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:46.340
That'd be Clarence Thomas.
His is the name that's been made mud of.

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:50.060
There's clearly a brass-knuckles,

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:53.420
totally unfair process
of brutalizing Presidential appointees.

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.060
How much of an exploration

01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:00.540
of not only Supreme Court candidates but
all candidates for public office do you want?

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:02.768
Do you have anything further to say about it?

01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:08.740
Senator, my reaction to this has been...

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:11.060
Over the last two weeks,
has been one of horror.

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.020
I can't tell you what I've lived through.

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.060
I think I did the right thing.

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:21.645
I think I did what was proper and correct
in this situation.

01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:23.690
(CAMERAS CLICKING)

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.330
- Rasputin.
- Rasputin.

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:30.166
Rasputin.
