WEBVTT

00:12.367 --> 00:14.567
(Meredith) THE PROBLEM
WITH BEING A RESIDENT IS...

00:14.600 --> 00:16.500
YOU FEEL CRAZY ALL THE TIME.

00:16.533 --> 00:19.167
***

00:19.200 --> 00:21.133
YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT IN YEARS.

00:21.167 --> 00:24.033
(whirring)

00:24.067 --> 00:27.067
***

00:28.533 --> 00:30.033
YOU SPEND EVERY DAY

00:30.067 --> 00:33.433
AROUND PEOPLE
IN MASSIVE CRISIS.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.667
YOU LOSE YOUR ABILITY
TO JUDGE WHAT'S NORMAL...

00:35.700 --> 00:38.833
MOVE YOUR CRAP OFF THE FLOOR
BEFORE THIS THING EATS IT!

00:38.867 --> 00:42.100
O-OKAY. OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

00:42.133 --> 00:45.633
IN YOURSELF OR ANYONE ELSE.

00:45.667 --> 00:47.667
AND YET PEOPLE
ARE CONSTANTLY ASKING YOU

00:50.567 --> 00:53.500
HOW THE HELL
ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO KNOW?
EGGS GOOD?

00:53.533 --> 00:56.433
MMM. OOH. THE BABY
DIDN'T LIKE THE BREAKFAST.

00:56.467 --> 00:58.567
ALL RIGHT, INTO THE CAN.
COME ON.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.500
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW YOU'RE DOING.

01:00.533 --> 01:01.600
(retches)

01:01.633 --> 01:03.533
WE HAD OUR FIRST
HONEST CONVERSATION

01:03.567 --> 01:05.467
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS,
AND NOW YOU WANT TO LEAVE.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.767
THAT TIMING
DOESN'T STRIKE YOU AS STRANGE?

01:07.800 --> 01:09.600
NO!
AND I'M STILL FIRING YOU.

01:09.633 --> 01:11.733
NO, YOU'RE QUITTING.

01:11.767 --> 01:14.500
NO, I'M NOT QUITTING.
I DON'T QUIT THINGS.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.067
WELL, ACTUALLY, YOU DO.

01:16.100 --> 01:17.833
YOUR MOTHER QUIT YOUR FATHER.
YOUR FATHER QUIT YOU.

01:17.867 --> 01:19.400
YOU QUIT YOUR BOYFRIEND.

01:19.433 --> 01:22.133
AND IF I READ
YOUR HOSPITAL CHART CORRECTLY,

01:22.167 --> 01:25.167
YOU QUIT YOUR LIFE MOMENTARILY
ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.800
YOU QUIT. IT'S WHAT
YOU KNOW HOW TO DO.
NOW YOU'RE REALLY FIRED.

01:28.833 --> 01:30.733
NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.

01:30.767 --> 01:32.667
AND I WANT YOU TO HANDLE
ALL MY CONSULTS.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.600
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO
WITHOUT ME, DO IT.

01:34.633 --> 01:36.533
AND BOOK SOME TIME
IN THE ROBOTICS LAB.

01:36.567 --> 01:38.767
I WANT TO GIVE HIM A TOUR. HAHN,
WALTER TAPLEY'S COMING IN TODAY.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.067
DO WE HAVE ANYTHING SPECIAL
THAT HE CAN SCRUB IN ON?

01:41.100 --> 01:44.300
WALTER TAPLEY IS COMING HERE?
THE CHIEF WAS HIS STUDENT.

01:44.333 --> 01:48.200
YOU STUDIED
AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD? WOW.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.300
WE NEED SOMETHING IMPRESSIVE.
I WILL STAB SOMEONE
IN THE CHEST IF I HAVE TO.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.800
(laughs)

01:52.833 --> 01:54.733
O'MALLEY, GET BOYER READY
FOR HIS C.T.

01:54.767 --> 01:56.100
AND PREP MY LAP CHOLE.

01:56.133 --> 01:58.033
I NEED TO BE OUTTA THAT O.R.
BY 10:00.

01:58.067 --> 02:00.133
HAHN,
PLAN TO BE FREE AT 10:00.

02:00.167 --> 02:02.067
O'MALLEY, DID PATRICIA SAY
I HAD ANY MESSAGES?

02:02.100 --> 02:04.100
YEAH, SHE SAID...

02:04.133 --> 02:06.333
SHE SAID TO TELL YOU
THAT YOUR WIFE HADN'T CALLED

02:06.367 --> 02:08.333
IN THE 20 MINUTES SINCE YOU LAST
ASKED IF YOUR WIFE CALLED.

02:08.367 --> 02:09.567
ALL RIGHT.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.133
(elevator bell dings)

02:11.167 --> 02:12.567
HEY.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.200
I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT
THIS NEW VIRAL COCKTAIL.

02:15.233 --> 02:18.167
ADDING IN I.L.-2 SHOULD MAKE
A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE.

02:18.200 --> 02:22.167
WE'RE CLOSE. WE'RE GONNA OPEN
THIS BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE SOON.
I KNOW.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.533
YOU OKAY?
I'M FINE.

02:24.567 --> 02:27.067
MM-HMM. LISTEN, CLINICAL TRIALS
CAN BE A GRIND.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.800
IF THIS IS GETTING TO YOU,
I CAN DO THIS ONE ON MY OWN.

02:29.833 --> 02:32.367
I'M NOT A QUITTER. I DON'T
NEED YOU TO RESCUE ME.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.400
LET'S JUST DO THIS.
(woman) BECAUSE WAITING
IS A BAD IDEA.

02:35.433 --> 02:38.500
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR HEALTH.
DR. SHEPHERD CAN SAY NO
IF IT'S SUCH A PROBLEM.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.433
WHAT AM I SAYING NO TO?
IS THERE ANY WAY

02:40.467 --> 02:42.367
YOU COULD PUSH BACK
THE SURGERY A FEW HOURS?

02:42.400 --> 02:44.033
MY BOYFRIEND'S FLIGHT
WAS CANCELED.

02:44.067 --> 02:45.800
I WANT HIM TO BE HERE.
GRETA.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.633
MM-HMM.
HE HAS SOME QUESTIONS.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.367
HE'S SO SMART ABOUT THIS STUFF.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO ASK.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.400
ARE YOU RECONSIDERING
THE PROCEDURE?

02:52.433 --> 02:55.400
ANDRE AND I HAVE HAD
SO LITTLE TIME TOGETHER.

02:55.433 --> 02:59.167
WE MET IN JANUARY. I MEAN, THIS
TREATMENT COULD KILL ME, RIGHT?

02:59.200 --> 03:01.100
YOU HAVE
A VERY AGGRESSIVE TUMOR.

03:01.133 --> 03:04.267
EVEN IF WE DON'T OPERATE,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A FEW MONTHS.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.200
BUT I'D SPEND THEM
WITH ANDRE.

03:06.233 --> 03:08.167
DO YOU KNOW HOW PRECIOUS
THAT IS,

03:08.200 --> 03:10.567
TIME WITH THE PERSON
YOU LOVE?

03:10.600 --> 03:13.400
(woman) GRETA, PLEASE.
I'M NOT SAYING
I WANT TO CANCEL.

03:13.433 --> 03:15.600
I'M JUST SAYING
I WANT TO WAIT FOR ANDRE.

03:15.633 --> 03:17.433
HE'LL HELP ME TO DECIDE.

03:17.467 --> 03:19.267
OKAY, WE CAN'T WAIT FOR--

03:19.300 --> 03:22.267
HE'LL BE HERE AT 3:00.

03:26.067 --> 03:27.733
DR. MARK SLOAN.

03:27.767 --> 03:29.667
I USED TO BE
A PATIENT OF HIS.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.400
REBECCA?

03:31.433 --> 03:33.233
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

03:33.267 --> 03:34.600
HI, IZZIE.

03:34.633 --> 03:37.100
I'VE--I'VE CALLED YOU
AND LEFT, LIKE, 50 MESSAGES.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.833
YOU SEEM KIND OF UPSET.

03:38.867 --> 03:40.833
WELL, YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT,
FIRST OF ALL,

03:40.867 --> 03:42.833
AND ALEX HAS BEEN TURNING
HIS LIFE UPSIDE DOWN

03:42.867 --> 03:44.367
TO BE YOUR BABY DADDY,

03:44.400 --> 03:46.300
AND I CAN'T TELL HIM
BECAUSE OF CONFIDENTIALITY.

03:46.333 --> 03:49.300
SO YEAH, UPSET.
YOU CAN TALK TO ALEX
ABOUT ANYTHING.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.233
I WANT HIM INVOLVED.
AND I AM PREGNANT.

03:51.267 --> 03:52.767
YOU KIND OF KNOW.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.700
OKAY. SO IF YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO TRAP ALEX

03:54.733 --> 03:56.233
WITH A FAKE PREGNANCY,

03:56.267 --> 03:59.200
YOU WON'T MIND IF I DO
ANOTHER TEST, JUST TO BE SURE.

03:59.233 --> 04:01.133
TRAP HIM?
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

04:01.167 --> 04:03.133
I'M PREGNANT,
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING

04:03.167 --> 04:05.100
BECAUSE I WANT THIS BABY.

04:05.133 --> 04:07.367
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A BABY.
YOU HAVE A BABY.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.333
OF COURSE I DO.
I MEAN I WANT ANOTHER ONE.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.667
DO THE STUPID TEST AGAIN.
IT'LL BE FINE.

04:12.700 --> 04:16.200
AND I NEED TO SEE DR. SLOAN.
CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT?

04:16.233 --> 04:18.733
YEAH, I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

04:18.767 --> 04:20.267
DR. SHEPHERD.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.633
YES.

04:21.667 --> 04:24.067
THERE'S NO ANDRE.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.167
WHAT?

04:25.200 --> 04:27.333
SHE MADE HIM UP.
HE DOESN'T EXIST.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.533
MY SISTER--SHE IS NOT A WOMAN
WHO HAS BOYFRIENDS, OKAY?

04:29.567 --> 04:32.300
AND THEN FOUR MONTHS AGO,
SHE GOES ON A CRUISE

04:32.333 --> 04:35.067
AND COMES BACK SAYING
SHE'S MET HER SOUL MATE.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.267
RIGHT AROUND THE TIME
HER SYMPTOMS STARTED?

04:37.300 --> 04:40.700
THERE WERE NO PICTURES,
AND NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN HIM.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.100
CAN YOU TALK TO HER?

04:42.133 --> 04:44.600
CAN YOU TELL HER
WE CAN'T WAIT FOR ANDRE?

04:44.633 --> 04:46.633
'CAUSE WE COULD BE WAITING
A LONG TIME.

04:49.533 --> 04:51.433
IS TAPLEY IN THERE?
NO.

04:51.467 --> 04:52.833
YOU'RE LYING.
YES.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.767
TAPLEY IN THERE?
NO.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.700
LIAR.
YES.

04:56.733 --> 04:59.433
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH HER.
OH, NO, IT'S NOT.
I'M FINE.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.100
SHE CLEANED--

05:01.133 --> 05:04.100
CLEANED THE APARTMENT--
WHICH SHE HAS NO IDEA HOW TO DO,

05:04.133 --> 05:05.767
SO SHE BASICALLY
JUST PUSHED DIRT AROUND.
OH, LEAVE HER ALONE.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.733
NOT EVERYBODY
HAS TO BE HAPPY ALL THE TIME.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.533
THAT'S NOT MENTAL HEALTH.
THAT'S CRAP.
WALTER TAPLEY'S HERE, AND SHE
DOESN'T WANT TO MEET HIM.

05:11.567 --> 05:13.467
WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S BAD.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.100
YOU KNOW, TORRES,
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

05:16.133 --> 05:18.500
YOU--YOU NEED TO GET HELP.
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

05:18.533 --> 05:20.433
IF YOU HANG OUT
UNTIL HAHN GETS HERE,

05:20.467 --> 05:23.167
YOU MIGHT GET TO MEET TAPLEY.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.100
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT WALTER TAPLEY.

05:25.133 --> 05:28.267
CRISTINA...
ARE YOU IN THE DARK PLACE?

05:28.300 --> 05:29.467
YEAH.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.767
ME, TOO.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.600
(siren wailing)

05:34.633 --> 05:36.600
(Richard) THERE SHE IS.

05:36.633 --> 05:38.533
DR. ERICA HAHN, OUR CHIEF
OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY.

05:38.567 --> 05:41.100
IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU,
DR. TAPLEY.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.500
I USE YOUR MODIFIED
BYPASS PROCEDURE ALL THE TIME.

05:43.533 --> 05:46.300
YEAH. WELL, THAT WAS
AN AFTERNOON WELL SPENT.

05:46.333 --> 05:48.100
YOU CAME UP WITH THAT
IN AN AFTERNOON?

05:48.133 --> 05:49.467
IT TOOK HIM SIX YEARS.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.833
YOU'RE A KILLJOY, WEBBER.
(laughs)

05:51.867 --> 05:54.033
I DIDN'T REALLY COME HERE
FOR A VISIT.

05:54.067 --> 05:56.367
I HAVE AORTIC
AND MITRAL STENOSIS

05:56.400 --> 05:58.133
WITH TRICUSPID REGURGE.

05:58.167 --> 06:00.433
I NEED
A DOUBLE VALVE REPLACEMENT

06:00.467 --> 06:03.400
AND TRICUSPID REPAIR.

06:03.433 --> 06:05.400
ARE YOU SURE?

06:05.433 --> 06:09.533
(sigh) CHARTS, ECHOS,

06:09.567 --> 06:12.133
CHEST X-RAYS--
EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

06:12.167 --> 06:14.067
I MAY HAVE INVENTED
THE MODIFIED BYPASS,

06:14.100 --> 06:16.800
BUT I CAN'T OPERATE
ON MYSELF.

06:16.833 --> 06:19.767
AND MY COLLEAGUES
WON'T TOUCH ME

06:19.800 --> 06:22.700
BECAUSE I HAVE CHRONIC A-FIB,
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION

06:22.733 --> 06:24.700
AND A CLOT IN MY LEFT ATRIUM.

06:24.733 --> 06:27.567
THEY THINK IF THEY OPERATE,
THEY'LL KILL ME.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.633
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WE'LL DO IT
IF YOUR COLLEAGUES WON'T?

06:30.667 --> 06:32.567
I DIDN'T START THEIR CAREERS.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.100
THEY CAN SAY NO TO ME.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.533
WEBBER CAN'T.

06:45.633 --> 06:46.867
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.467
NOW HOLD ON.
WE HAVEN'T EVEN DISC--
HAVE YOU READ THE FILE?

06:49.500 --> 06:51.633
HIS PULMONARY ARTERIAL PRESSURE
IS THROUGH THE ROOF.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.767
HE'S AWARE OF THE RISK.
OH! WELL, IN THAT CASE, FINE.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.200
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT.

06:56.233 --> 06:58.367
I MAY GO DOWN IN HISTORY
AS THE SURGEON

06:58.400 --> 07:00.067
WHO KILLED WALTER TAPLEY,

07:00.100 --> 07:02.200
BUT HEY, AT LEAST
THEY'RE WRITING ABOUT ME?

07:02.233 --> 07:04.200
ERICA, SIT DOWN.

07:04.233 --> 07:06.267
(sighs)
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.600
38 YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS
A YOUNG INTERN--

07:08.633 --> 07:10.767
I'M SORRY. IS THIS GONNA BE
A STORY ABOUT HOW YOU WERE

07:10.800 --> 07:13.367
A STRUGGLING BLACK MED STUDENT
WHO WANTED TO BE A SURGEON,

07:13.400 --> 07:15.333
AND NO ONE
WOULD GIVE YOU A CHANCE,

07:15.367 --> 07:17.267
AND WALTER TAPLEY
GAVE YOU THAT CHANCE?

07:17.300 --> 07:19.200
HE MENTORED YOU,
AND WITHOUT HIM,

07:19.233 --> 07:21.167
YOU WOULDN'T BE
IN THIS HOSPITAL TODAY?
YES.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.300
I'M STILL
NOT GONNA OPERATE ON HIM.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.767
OKAY, THE SEX--I THOUGHT
THAT WAS MIND-BLOWING MYSELF,

07:25.800 --> 07:28.667
BUT I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT
YOU HAD A REALLY BAD TIME.
WHAT?

07:28.700 --> 07:30.667
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING ME?
I'M--I'M SORRY.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.567
I-I LOST A PATIENT.
I'M NOT TRYING TO AVOID YOU.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.500
SO NOT CALLING ME
AFTER THE SEX

07:35.533 --> 07:37.433
IS YOU BEING
A DEDICATED LIFESAVER?
IT IS.

07:37.467 --> 07:39.467
SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER?

07:41.267 --> 07:43.167
YOU DIDN'T CALL HER?

07:43.200 --> 07:45.333
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
CALLED A WOMAN AFTER HAVING SEX?

07:45.367 --> 07:48.600
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S GONNA CHANGE.
I'M TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF.

07:48.633 --> 07:50.533
WHAT WAS WRONG
WITH THE OLD LEAF?

07:50.567 --> 07:53.033
SO THEY CALLED YOU A WHORE?
YOU'RE A HAPPY GUY.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.367
WALTER TAPLEY NEEDS
A DOUBLE VALVE REPLACEMENT,

07:55.400 --> 07:57.300
AND HAHN REFUSES
TO GIVE IT TO HIM.
WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?

07:57.333 --> 07:59.033
SHE THINKS
SHE'S GONNA KILL HIM.
(Derek and Mark) LIGHTWEIGHT.

07:59.067 --> 08:01.733
SINCE WHEN DO SURGEONS
TURN ME DOWN?
IT'S HER CHOICE. SHE'S THE ONE
OPENING HIM UP.

08:01.767 --> 08:03.600
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.533
OH, OH, AND ANOTHER THING.
MM-HMM.

08:05.567 --> 08:07.467
IF YOU SPEND THE NIGHT
WITH A WOMAN

08:07.500 --> 08:10.067
AND CALL HER THE NEXT DAY
AND SHE DOESN'T CALL YOU BACK,

08:10.100 --> 08:12.033
DOES THAT MEAN
SHE HAD A LOUSY TIME,

08:12.067 --> 08:14.767
OR DOES THAT MEAN HER ANSWERING
MACHINE WAS CONSUMED IN A FIRE?
SEE, THE CHIEF CALLS
THE NEXT DAY.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.700
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
CALL HER BACK.

08:16.733 --> 08:18.667
YOU--YOU JUST MET THIS PERSON.
IT'S NEW. IT'S FUN.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.700
IT'S CASUAL.
IT'S MY WIFE.

08:20.733 --> 08:22.633
(Derek and Mark) OH.
WHAT, DO I CALL AGAIN?

08:22.667 --> 08:24.200
NO, ANOTHER CALL
LOOKS DESPERATE.

08:24.233 --> 08:26.433
SEND HER AN E-MAIL.
INVITE HER TO DINNER.

08:26.467 --> 08:28.733
JUST BE CASUAL, CONFIDENT.
SEXY.

08:28.767 --> 08:31.267
I MEAN ROMANTIC.
MM.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.167
OH, O'MALLEY.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.100
YES, SIR.
TAPLEY'S IN 2062.

08:35.133 --> 08:37.033
HE'S GETTING
AN E.K.G. AND AN ECHO.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.767
I ASSIGNED YANG.
ALL RIGHT.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.300
OH, ONE MORE THING.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.467
OKAY.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.267
LOOK, I KNOW I SAID

08:43.300 --> 08:45.200
I WOULDN'T USE YOU
TO GET MY WIFE BACK,

08:45.233 --> 08:47.267
BUT I AM A DESPERATE MAN.
OKAY, LAY IT ON ME.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.167
DRAFT AN E-MAIL...
MM-HMM.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.467
ASK HER TO DINNER.
NO, NO, DON'T ASK HER.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.200
TELL HER.
SHE LIKES A STRONG HAND.
OKAY, YOU WANT ME

08:54.233 --> 08:56.767
TO ASK YOUR WIFE OUT ON A DATE
WITH A STRONG HAND.
CONFIDENT.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.600
CONFIDENT.
CASUAL.

08:58.633 --> 09:00.433
CASUAL.
SEXY.

09:00.467 --> 09:02.233
(whispers) SEXY.
TELL HER...

09:02.267 --> 09:04.167
TELL HER THE TRAIN
IS LEAVING THE STATION,

09:04.200 --> 09:07.133
AND SHE BETTER GET ON IT.
YEAH.

09:07.167 --> 09:10.100
CAN I TALK TO YOU
ABOUT REBECCA?
BUSY.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.033
ALEX, I GAVE HER
A PREGNANCY TEST LAST WEEK.

09:12.067 --> 09:13.600
SHE'S NOT PREGNANT.

09:13.633 --> 09:16.700
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.
YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW.

09:16.733 --> 09:19.200
ALEX, WHEN I TOLD HER,
SHE... SHE SAID I WAS WRONG.

09:19.233 --> 09:21.600
SHE THINKS IT'S SOME SORT OF
FALSE NEGATIVE, WHICH IT ISN'T.

09:21.633 --> 09:24.600
SHE WAS PUKING THIS MORNING,
AND HER BOOBS ARE ALL BLOWN UP.
I RAN IT TWICE.

09:24.633 --> 09:26.533
WELL, LABS ARE WRONG
ALL THE TIME,

09:26.567 --> 09:28.467
AND YOU'RE WRONG
ALL THE TIME.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.600
HOW 'BOUT YOU MIND
YOUR OWN FREAKIN' BUSINESS

09:30.633 --> 09:32.233
AND STAY OUT OF MY LIFE?
(knock on door)

09:32.267 --> 09:35.467
YOU HAVE MY CHART, AND I WOULD
PREFER IT IF YOU DIDN'T

09:35.500 --> 09:37.633
BECAUSE I FIRED YOU.
CAN I HAVE MY CHART, PLEASE?

09:37.667 --> 09:40.333
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO SHOW UP
AT MY DOOR UNANNOUNCED.

09:40.367 --> 09:42.633
AND YOU DIDN'T FIRE ME.
YOU QUIT.

09:42.667 --> 09:45.133
SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO UNQUIT,
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.600
YOU KNOW...

09:47.633 --> 09:49.567
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT, GREY.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.600
IT'S WHAT WE DO.

09:57.167 --> 09:59.067
AT THE MOMENT,
NO SURGERY'S BEEN SCHEDULED,

09:59.100 --> 10:01.800
SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON KEEPING
HIM STABLE AND COMFORTABLE.

10:01.833 --> 10:04.533
ANYTHING HE WANTS.
HE WANTS A STEAK, KILL A COW.

10:04.567 --> 10:06.633
KAREV, BEDSIDE P.F.T.s
AND AN A.B.G.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.133
(pager beeping)

10:08.167 --> 10:10.667
YANG, RUN A C-CENTRAL LINE--
SORRY.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.200
AH... DAMN DAY CARE CENTER
PAGES ME

10:13.233 --> 10:16.233
EVERY TIME HE GETS
A RUNNY NOSE.
O'MALLEY, GO FIND OUT
WHAT THEY WANT.

10:16.267 --> 10:19.133
I NEED BAILEY FOCUSED
ON TAPLEY.
GO TO THE DAY CARE CENTER?

10:19.167 --> 10:21.667
QUICKLY.
RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB.

10:21.700 --> 10:25.433
GREY, TAPLEY NEEDS
A CENTRAL LINE.

10:25.467 --> 10:27.433
DO IT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:27.467 --> 10:30.033
TAKE A NEEDLE, JAB IT
INTO HIS SUBCLAVIAN

10:30.067 --> 10:31.800
SO HE CAN RECEIVE MEDICINE
AND NOT CROAK--

10:31.833 --> 10:33.500
A CENTRAL LINE.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.433
BUT I--WELL, I'VE--
I'VE NEVER DONE ONE.

10:35.467 --> 10:37.233
DR. YANG.

10:37.267 --> 10:39.067
HEY. HOW'D IT GO
WITH GRETA?

10:39.100 --> 10:40.700
I HAVEN'T
SPOKEN TO HER YET.

10:40.733 --> 10:42.667
YOU HAVEN'T
SPOKEN TO HER YET?

10:42.700 --> 10:44.367
I ALREADY MIXED THE VIRUS
AND THE I.L.-2.

10:44.400 --> 10:47.500
WE ONLY HAVE SIX HOURS.
WE'RE NOT GONNA WAIT SIX HOURS.
WE'RE GONNA WAIT THREE HOURS.

10:47.533 --> 10:49.533
DEREK, THE GUY WE'RE
WAITING FOR DOESN'T EXIST.
I WANT TO GIVE HER

10:49.567 --> 10:51.467
A LITTLE MORE TIME
TO ENJOY HIM,

10:51.500 --> 10:53.400
OR THE IDEA OF HIM
IF NOTHING ELSE.

10:53.433 --> 10:55.333
BECAUSE ONCE WE REMOVE
THE TUMOR,

10:55.367 --> 10:58.667
IT'S ALL GONNA DISAPPEAR.
IT'S NOT REAL.
IT'S OKAY IF IT DISAPPEARS.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.800
SHE CAN GO BACK TO HER LIFE.
SHE WAS PROBABLY
A LONELY PERSON.

11:00.833 --> 11:03.700
SHE FOUND A WAY TO HAVE LOVE.
OF COURSE SHE DID BECAUSE
THAT'S WHERE LOVE EXISTS,

11:03.733 --> 11:05.667
IN DELUSIONAL FANTASIES.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.600
REAL LOVE ISN'T LIKE THAT.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.100
GOOD TO KNOW.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.300
HE PUNCHED SOMEONE
NAMED HARRISON.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.667
YOU PUNCHED A CHILD?

11:18.700 --> 11:21.067
APPARENTLY THERE WAS
A GRAHAM CRACKER INVOLVED.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.367
OVER A GRAHAM CRACKER?!

11:23.400 --> 11:26.433
THEY SAID THEY WANT YOU
TO TALK TO HIM.
WELL, HE'S 14 MONTHS OLD.

11:26.467 --> 11:28.367
WHAT DO THEY THINK
I'M GONNA DO,

11:28.400 --> 11:31.467
GIVE HIM A LECTURE ON
NONVIOLENT CONFLICT RESOLUTION?
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

11:31.500 --> 11:35.733
UH, WELL... MY SON PUNCHES
OTHER CHILDREN. PERFECT.

11:35.767 --> 11:38.067
HEY. UM, DR. YANG--WHO'S EVEN
MORE EVIL THAN USUAL--

11:38.100 --> 11:40.567
ASKED ME TO DO A CENTRAL LINE.
OKAY, THIS IS A BIG DAY.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.067
THIS IS THE KIND OF DAY THAT
COULD CHANGE THINGS FOR ME.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.833
IN THERE IS TAPLEY,
AND TAPLEY IS GOD, RIGHT?

11:44.867 --> 11:47.100
I'M THE CHIEF'S INTERN.
THAT MAKES ME CLOSE TO GOD,

11:47.133 --> 11:49.233
WHICH MEANS
I CAN'T HELP YOU RIGHT NOW,

11:49.267 --> 11:52.500
AS UNCHRISTIAN
AS THAT MAY SOUND.
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
NO, I'LL--

11:52.533 --> 11:54.233
I'LL DO WALTER TAPLEY'S
CENTRAL LINE MYSELF.

11:54.267 --> 11:57.800
SO I PUNCTURE HIS LUNG?
HE'LL GET OVER IT.
WHAT? SHE WANTS YOU TO DO
TAPLEY'S LINE?

11:57.833 --> 12:00.400
I'LL DO IT.
YAY! YAY FOR GEORGIE!
GEORGIE SAVES THE DAY.

12:00.433 --> 12:03.200
I GIVE YOU TAPLEY, AND YOU
PASS IT OVER TO YOUR INTERN?

12:03.233 --> 12:06.100
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?
DO YOU THINK IF YOU, UM,

12:06.133 --> 12:09.433
KISS THE CHIEF'S ASS ENOUGH
BY TAKING CARE OF TAPLEY,

12:09.467 --> 12:11.367
SOMETHING MAGICAL'S
GONNA HAPPEN?

12:11.400 --> 12:13.067
LIKE WHAT, YOU'LL EARN
YOUR MAGICAL RESIDENT WINGS?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.333
OH, WELL, NO. NO.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, GEORGE.

12:15.367 --> 12:18.500
YOU'RE STUCK.
YOU ARE WHERE YOU ARE.

12:18.533 --> 12:21.233
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY WAY
THAT YOU'D GET OUT OF

12:21.267 --> 12:23.533
YOUR MISERABLE SITUATION
IS IF BURKE WERE HERE,

12:23.567 --> 12:25.633
BECAUSE YOU WERE BURKE'S GUY.

12:25.667 --> 12:28.600
FOR SOME REASON HE PITIED YOUR
PATHETIC ASS. BUT HE'S GONE NOW.

12:28.633 --> 12:31.700
(singsong voice)
NO WINGS FOR GEORGIE.

12:33.433 --> 12:35.400
WAS I HAPPY
WHEN I WAS WITH HER?

12:35.433 --> 12:37.067
OFF AND ON.

12:37.100 --> 12:39.200
I THINK I IDEALIZE IT.

12:39.233 --> 12:41.167
I MEAN, YOU WOULDN'T HANG ON
TO A WOMAN

12:41.200 --> 12:42.667
WHO'S UNAVAILABLE,
UNPREDICTABLE, RIGHT?

12:42.700 --> 12:44.300
YOU'D MOVE ON,
KEEP IT CASUAL.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.567
DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.433
ALLOW YOURSELF TO GROW
WITH ROSE--

12:48.467 --> 12:51.400
SHARE EXPERIENCES,
BUILD MEMORIES.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.633
IS THIS THE NEW LEAF?
YEAH. (chuckles)

12:53.667 --> 12:55.233
(laughs) NEEDS WORK.

12:55.267 --> 12:57.167
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS GONNA KILL ME.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.533
(elevator bell dings)

12:58.567 --> 13:01.700
NICE WORK. YOU FOUND
THE SUBCLAVIAN ON THE FIRST TRY.

13:01.733 --> 13:04.167
GOT YOURSELF A GOOD RESIDENT.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.133
ACTUALLY, UH, SIR,
I'M AN INTERN.

13:06.167 --> 13:08.433
UH, HE'S THE BEST INTERN
IN THE HOSPITAL.

13:08.467 --> 13:11.067
O'MALLEY, START DR. TAPLEY

13:11.100 --> 13:12.733
ON A LOADING DOSE
OF AMIODARONE,

13:12.767 --> 13:14.667
FOLLOWED BY
A CONTINUOUS INFUSION.
(George) YES, SIR.

13:14.700 --> 13:17.600
WHY THE HELL WOULD HE
START ME ON AMIODARONE?

13:17.633 --> 13:19.433
O'LEARY, WOULD YOU
GIVE AMIODARONE

13:19.467 --> 13:22.367
TO A MAN WHO'S ABOUT TO HAVE
AN OPEN-HEART PROCEDURE?

13:22.400 --> 13:25.133
GEORGE, WOULD YOU
WAIT OUTSIDE, PLEASE?

13:27.433 --> 13:28.600
(sighs)

13:28.633 --> 13:31.467
IF YOU CAN'T GET THE HEAD
OF CARDIOTHORACICS

13:31.500 --> 13:33.200
TO DO A VALVE REPLACEMENT,

13:33.233 --> 13:35.400
THEN YOU'RE NOT THE CHIEF
I THOUGHT YOU WERE,

13:35.433 --> 13:38.267
AND THIS IS NOT THE FACILITY
I THOUGHT IT WAS.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.200
SO MAYBE IT'S BETTER
FOR ALL OF US

13:40.233 --> 13:42.733
IF I DON'T GET CUT OPEN HERE.

13:42.767 --> 13:47.167
WOULD YOU GET THESE LINES
OFF ME?
WOULD YOU
GET BACK IN THAT BED?

13:49.067 --> 13:52.100
I'LL TALK TO HER AGAIN.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.567
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA WATCH
THE WALTER TAPLEY SURGERY?

13:57.600 --> 13:59.500
I DON'T WANT FIVE MINUTES
WITH WALTER TAPLEY.

13:59.533 --> 14:01.200
I WANT FIVE YEARS.

14:01.233 --> 14:03.700
TAPLEY'S A STAR MAKER.
THAT'S WHY THE CHIEF'S A STAR.

14:03.733 --> 14:06.667
FIVE MINUTES WITH TAPLEY
IS A SLAP IN THE FACE.

14:06.700 --> 14:09.200
IT'S LIKE GIVING AN ALCOHOLIC
A SIP OF WINE.
LEXIE'S COMING OVER.

14:09.233 --> 14:11.433
LET'S TRY TO KEEP THE CARNAGE
TO A MINIMUM.

14:11.467 --> 14:15.733
HEY. UM, CAN I TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING?

14:15.767 --> 14:17.733
MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.

14:17.767 --> 14:19.667
UH, BUT--

14:19.700 --> 14:21.400
LOOK, YOU KNOW,
SHE HATES YOU. OKAY?

14:21.433 --> 14:23.500
SHE'S NOT
GONNA SAY IT TO YOUR FACE

14:23.533 --> 14:26.267
'CAUSE SHE'S TOO POLITE,
BUT SHE THINKS YOU'RE ANNOYING.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.600
AND YOU SHOWING UP HERE

14:28.633 --> 14:31.500
LIKE THE GOOD LITTLE GIRL
DADDY DIDN'T ABANDON IS, LIKE,

14:31.533 --> 14:33.433
THE WORST THING THAT'S HAPPENED
TO HER IN MONTHS.

14:33.467 --> 14:35.733
AND THAT'S SAYING A LOT
COMING FROM MEREDITH GREY.

14:40.300 --> 14:41.667
WHEW.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.633
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

14:43.667 --> 14:47.100
WANNA BET?

14:47.133 --> 14:48.467
MM. GIVE ME TWO MINUTES,

14:48.500 --> 14:51.700
I'LL MEET YOU IN
THE THIRD FLOOR ON CALL ROOM.

14:51.733 --> 14:54.800
NO, NO. WE'RE GONNA SIT
AND ENJOY A MEAL TOGETHER.
I DON'T GET IT.

14:54.833 --> 14:56.733
I'VE TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF.

14:56.767 --> 15:00.033
FROM NOW ON, IF YOU WANT THIS,
YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS, TOO.
EW.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.733
SHOVE OVER, SLOAN. TORRES AND I
ARE GONNA SHARE A SAPPHIC SALAD.

15:03.767 --> 15:05.667
(Mark)
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

15:05.700 --> 15:08.267
YEAH, WE'RE LOVERS.
DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

15:08.300 --> 15:11.167
IT'S A LOVE THAT DARE NOT
SPEAK ITS NAME.
MM-HMM. LOOK ME IN THE EYE,

15:11.200 --> 15:13.433
AND TELL ME THAT YOU'RE NOT
THINKING ABOUT A THREESOME.

15:13.467 --> 15:16.333
I'M NOT. THE OLD MARK WOULD,
BUT THAT'S NO MORE.

15:16.367 --> 15:18.500
REALLY? YOU'RE NOT, UH,
THINKING ABOUT

15:18.533 --> 15:20.467
HER AND ME AND YOU...

15:20.500 --> 15:22.400
(lowered voice)
AND A VIDEO CAMERA?

15:22.433 --> 15:23.333
(laughs)

15:23.367 --> 15:26.267
YEAH, ON CALL ROOM,
TEN MINUTES.
NO.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.533
I AM THE CHIEF OF SURGERY.

15:28.567 --> 15:31.300
I AM NOT KILLING WALTER TAPLEY.
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.500
SHOULD I LEAVE?

15:33.533 --> 15:35.200
NO. HE'S DYING ANYHOW.

15:35.233 --> 15:37.733
YOU'D RATHER SEE HIM DIE ON
MY WATCH THAN UNDER YOUR KNIFE?

15:37.767 --> 15:39.733
YES.
I SHOULD LEAVE.

15:39.767 --> 15:42.267
I SAID NO. IS THERE SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH ALL THE WOMEN

15:42.300 --> 15:44.233
THAT WHEN I SPEAK,
THEY SIMPLY IGNORE IT?

15:44.267 --> 15:47.100
YOU DON'T LEAVE.
YOU REVIEW THE FILE AGAIN.

15:47.133 --> 15:49.033
AND IF EITHER OF YOU SEE
MY WIFE, YOU TELL HER

15:49.067 --> 15:52.333
THE POLITE THING TO DO IS RETURN
A MAN'S DAMN PHONE CALL.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.100
SEE, A TUMOR
IN THE TEMPORAL LOBE

15:56.133 --> 15:58.833
CAN BLUR THE LINE BETWEEN
IMAGINATION AND REALITY.

15:58.867 --> 16:02.800
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ANDRE
IS PART OF THAT CONFUSION.

16:04.567 --> 16:06.567
SHE LIKES BEING
THE SUCCESSFUL SISTER

16:06.600 --> 16:08.567
WITH A HUSBAND AND KIDS

16:08.600 --> 16:10.500
WHILE I'M THE SINGLE,
PATHETIC ONE

16:10.533 --> 16:12.800
WHO HAS TO SEND HERSELF FLOWERS
ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

16:12.833 --> 16:15.800
I FOUND SOMEONE,
AND SHE CAN'T DEAL WITH IT.

16:15.833 --> 16:19.067
BUT THERE ARE
NO PICTURES OF HIM.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.367
YOU WANT A PICTURE?
THERE.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.267
THERE.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.700
AND THERE, AND THERE.

16:25.733 --> 16:28.667
BUT THOSE ARE DRAWINGS
MADE FROM IMAGES IN YOUR HEAD.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.667
I'M AN ARTIST.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
WHAT ABOUT THE JOURNALS
AND THE WRITING?

16:31.700 --> 16:34.167
DID YOU DO
A LOT OF THAT BEFORE?
LEAVE HER ALONE.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.233
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO
WRITE ABOUT BEFORE, DR. GREY.

16:37.267 --> 16:39.167
(Meredith) OKAY, IT'S JUST
THAT THERE'S A SYMPTOM--

16:39.200 --> 16:42.667
IT'S CALLED HYPERGRAPHIA--
IT'S COMPULSIVE WRITING.
LEAVE HER ALONE.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.533
I'M IN LOVE WITH A MAN.
I'VE TOUCHED HIM AND HELD HIM.

16:45.567 --> 16:48.033
HE IS NOT A FIGMENT
OF MY IMAGINATION.
(woman) TELL THEM HOW YOU MET.

16:48.067 --> 16:50.400
I WAS ON A CRUISE
AROUND THE GREEK ISLANDS,

16:50.433 --> 16:52.333
AND WE HAD STOPPED
AT SANTORINI,

16:52.367 --> 16:55.467
AND I WAS RUNNING TO GET BACK TO
THE SHIP, AND MY SHOE FELL OFF.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.533
AND THE HORN WAS BLOWING,
SO I DIDN'T WANT TO STOP,

16:57.567 --> 16:59.100
SO I LEFT IT.

16:59.133 --> 17:01.833
THAT NIGHT AT DINNER,
ANDRE FOUND ME. HE HAD MY SHOE.

17:01.867 --> 17:04.567
(woman) SOUND FAMILIAR?
YOU'RE MOCKING ME.

17:04.600 --> 17:07.033
NO, I'M NOT.
I'M TRYING TO MAKE YOU SEE.

17:07.067 --> 17:10.733
DR. SHEPHERD, DOES ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?

17:10.767 --> 17:13.100
SOUNDS LIKE "CINDERELLA."

17:13.133 --> 17:15.367
WHAT ELSE HAPPENED
ON THE BOAT?

17:15.400 --> 17:16.833
GRETA?

17:16.867 --> 17:18.767
I HAD MY FIRST BLACKOUTS.
ANDRE WAS THERE.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.667
HE CARRIED ME TO--

17:20.700 --> 17:23.333
OKAY, A WOMAN FOUND YOU
ON THE FLOOR OF THE BATHROOM.

17:23.367 --> 17:25.300
PRINCE CHARMING
DIDN'T CARRY YOU--

17:25.333 --> 17:27.233
GET OUT!
ALL OF YOU, GET OUT!

17:27.267 --> 17:29.600
THIS IS A STUPID, STUPID...

17:29.633 --> 17:31.633
STUPID CONVERSATION.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.367
HEY, GRETA,
THE SERUM THAT WE USE

17:34.400 --> 17:36.733
TO KILL THE TUMOR,
IT ONLY LASTS A FEW HOURS.

17:36.767 --> 17:38.667
SO--
IS IT GOING TO EXPIRE
BY 3:00?

17:38.700 --> 17:41.333
NO, IT IS NOT.
DR. SHEPHERD--

17:41.367 --> 17:44.200
IT IS NOT.
WE CAN WAIT UNTIL 3:00.

17:44.233 --> 17:46.333
WE CAN'T WAIT ALL DAY,

17:46.367 --> 17:48.633
BUT WE CAN WAIT UNTIL 3:00.

17:53.767 --> 17:56.633
HEY, YOU. HOW'S THE...

18:00.767 --> 18:02.667
SOME OF MY BEST WORK.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.267
ANY PULLING
AROUND THE SUTURE LINES?

18:05.300 --> 18:07.200
NO, IT'S PERFECT.

18:07.233 --> 18:10.133
I'M JUST NOT SURE
IT GOES WITH THE BODY.

18:10.167 --> 18:12.267
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.700
FACE IS A HEAD TURNER,

18:13.733 --> 18:17.700
BUT THE BOOBS AREN'T STOPPING
ANYBODY ON THE STREET.

18:17.733 --> 18:19.633
YOU CAN CLOSE THE GOWN.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.567
IT DOESN'T MATCH.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.433
IT DOESN'T GO WITH MY FACE. IT
DOESN'T GO WITH MY PERSONALITY.

18:24.467 --> 18:27.100
IT'S JUST ALL WRONG.
DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
YOU WERE PREGNANT?

18:27.133 --> 18:28.800
I CAN'T OPERATE--
I DON'T NEED A LECTURE.

18:28.833 --> 18:31.233
I JUST NEED YOU TO FINISH
WHAT YOU STARTED.

18:31.267 --> 18:33.600
CAN YOU DO THAT?

18:33.633 --> 18:36.733
***

18:36.767 --> 18:38.833
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.167
(woman) MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.100
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT

18:43.133 --> 18:45.233
JUST TO GET MY CHART BACK.

18:45.267 --> 18:48.133
I'D LIKE YOU TO GET IT
RIGHT NOW.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM IN PEACE.

18:48.167 --> 18:50.067
IT SEEMS THAT EVERYBODY'S
DISSATISFIED HERE.
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF

18:50.100 --> 18:51.833
SUGGESTING THAT I'M A COWARD
AND A QUITTER?

18:51.867 --> 18:54.467
ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME
FEEL BAD ABOUT MY LIFE

18:54.500 --> 18:56.800
SO THAT YOU CAN FIX ME?
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT
IN THERAPY.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.400
NO! I DON'T NEED THERAPY.

18:58.433 --> 19:00.333
I FORGIVE YOU.
LEXIE--

19:00.367 --> 19:03.233
NO, I FORGIVE YOU. I FORGIVE YOU
FOR TREATING ME LIKE CRAP,

19:03.267 --> 19:06.133
AND I FORGIVE YOU FOR LETTING
YOUR FRIEND TREAT ME LIKE CRAP.
LEXIE--

19:06.167 --> 19:08.133
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET UP
IN THE MORNING.

19:08.167 --> 19:10.067
I HONESTLY DON'T.
OUR DAD ABANDONED YOU,

19:10.100 --> 19:12.800
AND YOUR MOM, BY ALL ACCOUNTS,
WAS THE MEANEST PERSON EVER,

19:12.833 --> 19:14.733
AND YOU CAN'T LET DEREK
LOVE YOU,

19:14.767 --> 19:16.767
AND IT ALL REALLY,
REALLY SUCKS.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.667
BUT EVER SINCE I KNEW
YOU EXISTED,

19:18.700 --> 19:20.600
I HAD THIS FANTASY
ABOUT MY BIG SISTER.

19:20.633 --> 19:22.533
AND YOU HAVE FAILED
ON EVERY OCCASION

19:22.567 --> 19:25.033
TO LIVE UP TO THAT FANTASY,
BUT I STILL LOVE YOU,

19:25.067 --> 19:27.533
WHETHER YOU ARE CAPABLE
OF LETTING ME OR NOT.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.167
SO...

19:29.200 --> 19:30.667
I FORGIVE YOU.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.400
(toilet flushes)

19:32.433 --> 19:35.100
2:00 WORK FOR YOU?
YEAH, OKAY.

19:35.733 --> 19:38.067
IF THIS MAN DIES UNDER MY KNIFE,
RICHARD, SO HELP ME,

19:38.100 --> 19:39.833
I WILL TELL EVERY REPORTER
IN THE LAND

19:39.867 --> 19:41.767
THAT YOU INSISTED
WE DO THIS.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.800
YOU WILL LOOK LIKE
AN IDIOT.
RELAX. I'LL BE FINE.

19:43.833 --> 19:46.800
(scoffs)

19:46.833 --> 19:49.233
SHE HAS IMPECCABLE JUDGMENT.

19:49.267 --> 19:51.167
AND THIS MAY BE

19:51.200 --> 19:54.500
THE DUMBEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.333
TED GINSBURG
WOULD'VE DONE THIS,

19:59.367 --> 20:00.833
BUT I WANTED A FRIEND.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.667
IN CASE I WENT INTO THE O.R.
AND DIDN'T COME BACK,

20:03.700 --> 20:07.533
I WANTED AN OLD FRIEND
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

20:08.767 --> 20:10.433
I'M HONORED.

20:10.467 --> 20:11.733
DON'T BE.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.567
I SHOULDA HAD A WIFE...

20:15.600 --> 20:18.333
AND A BUNCH OF KIDS...

20:18.367 --> 20:20.500
SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO
TRACK YOU DOWN

20:20.533 --> 20:24.033
TO GET SOMEONE
TO BE AT MY DEATHBED.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.767
(Mark) STEVENS.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.700
WHAT ARE YOU TREATING
REBECCA POPE FOR?

20:29.733 --> 20:31.633
FOR A PREGNANCY
SHE DOESN'T HAVE,

20:31.667 --> 20:33.033
BUT SHE THINKS SHE DOES.

20:33.067 --> 20:35.500
DOESN'T ONE OF YOU
HAVE SCIENCE ON YOUR SIDE?

20:35.533 --> 20:38.533
YES. SHE IS ACTING
REALLY WEIRD.
SHE WANTS, UH,
BREAST ENHANCEMENT SURGERY.

20:38.567 --> 20:41.400
SHE THINKS HER NEW FACE
DOESN'T MATCH HER BODY.

20:41.433 --> 20:43.333
WE MAY BE LOOKING
AT ACUTE STRESS DISORDER.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.667
IT CAN HAPPEN WHEN PEOPLE
HAVE MASSIVE PLASTIC SURGERIES

20:45.700 --> 20:47.600
AND MAJOR TRAUMA
LIKE SHE DID.

20:47.633 --> 20:50.600
YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR,
YOU DON'T SEE THE SAME PERSON,

20:50.633 --> 20:52.833
SO YOU'RE NOT SURE YOU ARE
THE SAME PERSON.

20:52.867 --> 20:55.433
IT CAN LEAD TO
SOME PRETTY ODD BEHAVIOR.
LIKE THINKING YOU'RE PREGNANT
WHEN YOU'RE NOT

20:55.467 --> 20:58.333
AND FORGETTING
YOU ALREADY HAVE A BABY?
I WANT YOU TO MAKE IT CLEAR
TO HER THAT SHE'S NOT PREGNANT.

20:58.367 --> 21:00.200
THEN GET HER A PSYCH CONSULT,
THEN HAVE PSYCH CALL ME.
OKAY.

21:00.233 --> 21:02.133
HERE YOU ARE, CHIEF.

21:02.167 --> 21:04.200
UH, NO, NO, READ THAT--
READ THAT TO ME.

21:04.233 --> 21:06.167
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
ON THAT TINY SCREEN.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.300
(lowered voice) OH, NO.
THAT'S A BAD IDEA.
SPEAK UP, O'MALLEY.

21:09.333 --> 21:13.067
(normal voice) UM...
"DEAR ADELE, EAT WITH ME.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.133
"THE LOVE TRAIN
IS LEAVING THE STATION,

21:15.167 --> 21:17.467
AND YOU KNOW YOU WANT
TO TAKE A RIDE"--

21:17.500 --> 21:19.733
O'MALLEY.
"TAKE A RIDE
ON MY LOVE TRAIN."

21:19.767 --> 21:22.033
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,
I DIDN'T COME UP

21:22.067 --> 21:23.533
WITH THE TRAIN
OR THE STATION.

21:23.567 --> 21:26.067
OKAY, GIVE THAT TO ME.
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.
YES, SIR.

21:26.100 --> 21:28.433
HEY, SO, UM,
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

21:28.467 --> 21:30.367
IF I WANDER INTO
AN ON CALL ROOM,

21:30.400 --> 21:32.300
YOU ARE NOT
GONNA FOLLOW ME? (laughs)

21:32.333 --> 21:35.200
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHY
YOU NEED SEX ALL THE TIME?

21:35.233 --> 21:37.133
IS IT REPLACING SOMETHING?
OR ARE--

21:37.167 --> 21:39.067
I USE IT
TO CLEAR MY HEAD.

21:39.100 --> 21:41.433
SO...
(singsong voice) ON CALL ROOM.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.467
WE CAN SIT IN THERE AND TALK,
BUT WE'RE NOT HAVING SEX.
(whiny voice) WHY?

21:44.500 --> 21:46.467
(stomps foot)
WHAT ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT?

21:46.500 --> 21:48.667
AT LUNCH, YOU SEEMED TO WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THREESOMES.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.033
(normal voice) YOU ARE
SO NOT A NEW MAN.

21:51.067 --> 21:53.500
I MEAN, I GUESS IF YOU
HAD TO HAVE A THREESOME,

21:53.533 --> 21:55.800
ERICA HAHN WOULDN'T BE
A BAD CHOICE, RIGHT?

21:55.833 --> 21:58.600
I MEAN, SHE BRINGS THAT WHOLE
"WE'RE NAUGHTY, AND WE'RE

21:58.633 --> 22:01.133
GETTING SENT TO THE PRINCIPAL'S
OFFICE" THING TO IT.

22:01.167 --> 22:04.033
COME ON. YOU NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT
REACHING ACROSS THE O.R. TABLE

22:04.067 --> 22:07.400
AND PULLING DOWN HER MASK,
RIPPING OFF HER SCRUB CAP

22:07.433 --> 22:09.833
SO THAT YOU CAN GRAB A HANDFUL
OF THAT BLONDE HAIR--

22:09.867 --> 22:12.467
STOP. STOP TALKING
ABOUT ERICA HAHN.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.500
(sighs)

22:14.533 --> 22:15.700
(mutters)

22:18.567 --> 22:20.200
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

22:20.233 --> 22:22.400
ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS
OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

22:22.433 --> 22:24.267
IS ON THE TABLE,

22:24.300 --> 22:27.167
AND I AM ABOUT TO
SLICE OPEN HIS CHEST.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.800
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

22:29.833 --> 22:32.167
OKAY. SCALPEL.

22:34.300 --> 22:37.367
DON'T SCREW IT UP.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.433
(chuckles)
I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

22:40.467 --> 22:42.367
WE'VE GOT THIS PATIENT,

22:42.400 --> 22:45.100
AND SHE'S GOT TRUE LOVE.

22:45.133 --> 22:47.133
DO YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

22:47.167 --> 22:49.067
BECAUSE HER BOYFRIEND
DOESN'T EXIST.

22:49.100 --> 22:50.833
DEREK IS ALL BROKEN UP
OVER HER,

22:50.867 --> 22:53.800
LIKE IT MEANS SOMETHING
THAT SHE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR

22:53.833 --> 22:55.700
WITH A HALLUCINATION.

22:55.733 --> 22:58.300
BUT DEREK WASN'T READY
TO GIVE UP ON THE RELATIONSHIP,

22:58.333 --> 23:00.767
AND YOU WERE.
NO, I DIDN'T GIVE UP.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.633
I WANTED TO TRY AGAIN, AND THEN
HE WENT AND KISSED ROSE.

23:03.667 --> 23:05.567
SO HE'S THE ONE WHO MESSES UP,
NOT ME.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.500
BUT IT'S A RELATIONSHIP.
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

23:07.533 --> 23:09.700
AND YOU STAND BACK,
WAITING FOR HIM TO FAIL

23:09.733 --> 23:12.167
SO YOU CAN SAY,
"AHA! NOW I QUIT."

23:12.200 --> 23:13.767
NO. IT WASN'T WORKING.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.833
WAS YOUR LIFE NOT WORKING
WHEN YOU LET THAT

23:15.867 --> 23:19.467
SLIP OUT FROM UNDER YOU?
OKAY, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA STOP
SUGGESTING THAT I'M SUICIDAL?

23:19.500 --> 23:22.033
WHEN YOU START ACTING LIKE
SOMEBODY THAT WANTS TO BE ALIVE.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.800
GIVE ME MY CHART.
WHY?

23:23.833 --> 23:26.267
BECAUSE I'M NOT SUICIDAL,
AND IF IT SAYS THAT,

23:26.300 --> 23:29.067
THEN IT'S WRONG.
WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR
WHEN YOU FELL IN THE WATER?

23:29.100 --> 23:31.800
I ALMOST DROWNED. YOU THINK
I DID THAT FOR KICKS?
YOU PUT YOUR HAND

23:31.833 --> 23:34.300
IN A BODY CAVITY THAT CONTAINED
UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE.

23:34.333 --> 23:36.367
I WAS TRYING TO SAVE
A PATIENT.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.267
WHY IS IT THAT
EVERY OTHER PERSON IN THAT ROOM

23:39.300 --> 23:41.767
HAD THE SENSE TO HIT THE DECK?

23:41.800 --> 23:43.700
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE RUN AWAY
FROM THIS LINE

23:43.733 --> 23:45.600
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.

23:45.633 --> 23:48.500
YOU SEEM TO STAND ON IT
AND WAIT FOR A STRONG WIND

23:48.533 --> 23:51.233
TO SWAY YOU ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER.

23:51.267 --> 23:53.233
YOU'RE CARELESS
WITH YOUR LIFE.

23:53.267 --> 23:55.400
YOU'RE NOT SLITTING YOUR WRISTS,
BUT YOU'RE CARELESS,

23:55.433 --> 23:57.333
PROBABLY BECAUSE
YOUR MOTHER TOLD YOU

23:57.367 --> 23:59.267
YOU WERE A WASTE OF SPACE
ON THIS PLANET.

23:59.300 --> 24:00.767
THE PROBLEM IS,
YOU BELIEVED HER.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.533
AND IF YOU DON'T WATCH OUT,
ONE OF THESE DAYS,

24:03.567 --> 24:05.567
YOU'RE GONNA DIE
BECAUSE OF IT.

24:07.133 --> 24:09.767
HAND ME MY CHART.

24:11.233 --> 24:12.467
NOW!

24:19.433 --> 24:23.800
AND DON'T EVER TALK ABOUT
MY MOTHER AGAIN.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.367
(Erica)
OH, WHAT THE HELL IS...

24:29.400 --> 24:31.667
THERE'S A LEAK.
GO BACK ON BYPASS NOW.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.833
BAILEY, TAKE THE CLAMPS OFF
OF THE AORTIC AND VENOUS LINES.

24:33.867 --> 24:35.633
(Miranda) OKAY, GREY,
TAKE THE SUCTION.

24:35.667 --> 24:38.200
THE WHOLE LEFT ATRIUM IS TORN
WHERE THAT CLOT WAS ADHERED.

24:38.233 --> 24:40.400
METZENBAUM SCISSORS.
OH, GOD. THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

24:40.433 --> 24:42.833
IT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE
AND STUPID,

24:42.867 --> 24:46.200
AND I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT I LET YOU TALK ME INTO IT.

24:46.233 --> 24:47.667
MY REPUTATION'S

24:47.700 --> 24:50.400
GONNA BE IN THE TOILET
AT THE END OF THIS DAY.

24:50.433 --> 24:53.433
DAN SLOCUM AT MERCY IS GONNA
HAVE A FIELD DAY WITH THIS,

24:53.467 --> 24:55.767
CONDESCENDING TOOL
THAT HE IS.
ERICA--

24:55.800 --> 24:58.133
DON'T "ERICA" ME, RICHARD.
IT'S NOT YOUR GOOD NAME

24:58.167 --> 25:01.833
WE'RE GONNA DESTROY HERE TODAY,
MUCH AS I WISH THAT IT WAS.

25:01.867 --> 25:04.133
DR. HAHN, IT'S DONE.

25:06.433 --> 25:08.733
NO LEAK.
THE REPAIR IS HOLDING.

25:08.767 --> 25:10.633
YOU WERE SAYING?

25:10.667 --> 25:13.533
(chuckles)

25:13.567 --> 25:16.567

25:40.800 --> 25:43.067

25:45.300 --> 25:48.433

25:48.467 --> 25:50.533
MAYBE HIS PLANE
WAS DELAYED.

25:50.567 --> 25:52.467
HIS PHONE IS OFF.

25:52.500 --> 25:55.367
MAYBE HIS PHONE IS OFF
BECAUSE HE'S STILL ON THE PLANE.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.300
HE'S COMING.

25:57.333 --> 26:00.200

NO. YOUR TUMOR DID THIS.

26:14.833 --> 26:18.267

26:18.300 --> 26:20.633

THROUGH THE DAY, HUH?

27:07.767 --> 27:12.500
OUR SON HAS BEEN PUNCHING
OTHER CHILDREN.

27:12.533 --> 27:14.767
YEAH, I KNOW.
(chuckles) WHAT YOU MEAN,
YOU KNOW?

27:14.800 --> 27:17.300
IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE.
I'M DEALING WITH IT.

27:17.333 --> 27:18.633
WAIT A MINUTE.

27:18.667 --> 27:21.533
I HAD TO BRIBE THE DIRECTOR
OF THE DAY CARE CENTER

27:21.567 --> 27:23.300
TO GET HIM BACK IN.

27:23.333 --> 27:25.533
I HAD TO PROMISE TO BRING
APPLE SLICES

27:25.567 --> 27:27.833
AND GIVE FREE MAMMOGRAMS
TO THE TEACHERS.

27:27.867 --> 27:30.733
NOW WHY AREN'T YOU TELLING ME
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
I DON'T JUDGE
HOW YOU DO SURGERY.

27:30.767 --> 27:34.567
HOW ABOUT YOU DON'T JUDGE
HOW I DEAL WITH THE BABY?
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
YOU DIDN'T DEAL WITH IT.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.667
HE'S PUNCHING OTHER CHILDREN.
OF COURSE
HE'S PUNCHING PEOPLE.

27:36.700 --> 27:39.367
HE USED TO BE WITH ME ALL DAY,
AND NOW HE'S IN DAY CARE

27:39.400 --> 27:41.833
SO HE CAN SPEND TEN MINUTES
WITH YOU EVERY THREE HOURS.

27:41.867 --> 27:44.200
OKAY, SO THAT'S JUST MAKING
HIM VIOLENT NOW, RIGHT?
YES, HE'S GOT A LITTLE--

27:44.233 --> 27:46.233
(knocks on door)
HEY, TUCK.

27:46.267 --> 27:49.500
HEY, CAN I, UH, TAKE HIM
TO SAY HI FOR A MINUTE?

27:49.533 --> 27:51.067
UH, YEAH, SURE, SURE.

27:51.100 --> 27:54.167
YEAH, YOU WANNA GO PLAY
WITH THE OFFICE SUPPLIES?

27:55.667 --> 27:58.633
LOOK, IF YOU CAN'T COMMUNICATE
WELL ENOUGH TO TELL ME--

27:58.667 --> 28:00.633
DON'T LECTURE ME,
MIRANDA BAILEY.

28:00.667 --> 28:02.567
I'M NOT ONE OF YOUR STUDENTS.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.333
NOW I KNOW WITH ALL THE TIME
YOU SPEND AROUND HERE,

28:05.367 --> 28:08.100
IT'S HARD TO
DIFFERENTIATE SOMETIMES.
NO, I SPEND MY TIME HERE

28:08.133 --> 28:10.033
BECAUSE I'M BUILDING
A LIFE FOR US!

28:10.067 --> 28:12.700
I SPEND MY TIME HERE
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY

28:12.733 --> 28:15.600
OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
AND SPEND IT WITH OUR CHILD

28:15.633 --> 28:18.567
AND--AND KNOWING THAT MY CAREER
IS GONNA BE THERE WAITING FOR ME

28:18.600 --> 28:20.500
WHEN I'M READY TO GO BACK.
A LUXURY?

28:20.533 --> 28:22.733
SO YOU THINK SPENDING ALL DAY
EVERY DAY WIPING NOSES

28:22.767 --> 28:24.667
AND CHANGING DIAPERS
IS A LUXURY?

28:24.700 --> 28:27.567
NO, I THINK IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
THING THAT YOU GET TO DO!

28:27.600 --> 28:30.033
AND YOU'RE TAKING IT
FOR GRANTED!
I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED?

28:30.067 --> 28:32.033
YES!
I TAKE OUR FAMILY
FOR GRANTED?

28:32.067 --> 28:34.700
NO, I DID NOT SAY--
NO, YOU DID SAY.

28:34.733 --> 28:36.633
YOU DID SAY!
I WORK BECAUSE WE--

28:36.667 --> 28:38.267
YOU LOVE YOUR WORK.
AND I LOVE MY FAMILY, TOO!

28:38.300 --> 28:40.733
(Tucker) BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WILL
PICK UP THE SLACK AT HOME.
IT IS GOING TO BE OKAY.

28:40.767 --> 28:42.667
SO WHO TAKES WHO
FOR GRANTED?

28:42.700 --> 28:45.133
UNCLE GEORGE SAYS IT IS
GOING TO BE OKAY.
(Miranda speaks
indistinctly)

28:45.167 --> 28:48.033
(Rebecca) THIS USED TO HAPPEN
WHEN I WAS A KID.

28:48.067 --> 28:51.400
I'D GET A STREP TEST,
AND IT'D COME BACK NEGATIVE.

28:51.433 --> 28:54.400
LOOK, OKAY, THAT'S YOUR UTERUS.
THERE IS NOTHING IN THERE.

28:54.433 --> 28:58.133
NO FETUS, NO SACK, NOTHING.
BUT IT'S TOO EARLY.
IT'S TINY.

28:58.167 --> 29:00.000
YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING YET.

29:01.467 --> 29:03.600
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

29:03.633 --> 29:05.700
I PAGED YOU
20 MINUTES AGO.

29:05.733 --> 29:07.633
REBECCA, LOOK.

29:07.667 --> 29:10.400
OKAY, THIS IS A FETUS
AT 6 WEEKS.

29:10.433 --> 29:12.600
ALL RIGHT, IT'S A TINY SPOT,
BUT IT'S THERE.

29:12.633 --> 29:14.267
YOU CAN SEE IT.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.333
LOOK AT YOUR UTERUS.
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

29:16.367 --> 29:18.300
NOTHING.

29:18.333 --> 29:20.667
GET OUT.

29:20.700 --> 29:21.900
(Izzie sighs)

29:21.933 --> 29:25.167
HERE ARE HER LABS, AND THERE'S
A CHART NOTE FROM DR. SLOAN.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.433
I COULD GET A PSYCH CONSULT
FOR YOU IF YOU WANT.

29:27.467 --> 29:29.467
JUST GET OUT!

29:30.800 --> 29:32.533
WHAT?

29:34.367 --> 29:36.600
THERE'S NO BABY.

29:36.633 --> 29:38.833
I LOST THE BABY?

29:38.867 --> 29:40.467
NO, YOU--
YOU WEREN'T PREGNANT.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.433
IF YOU HAD BEEN PREGNANT,

29:42.467 --> 29:44.267
YOUR BETA H.C.G. LEVEL
WOULD HAVE BEEN ELEVATED.

29:44.300 --> 29:45.800
IT'S ZERO.

29:45.833 --> 29:48.467
YOU DIDN'T MISCARRY.
THERE NEVER WAS A BABY.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.800
(sighs)

29:50.833 --> 29:54.333
(voice breaks) I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LOST OUR BABY.

29:54.367 --> 29:56.567
REBECCA,
YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.700
(crying) I'M SO SORRY.

29:58.733 --> 30:00.633
LOOK AT ME.
ARE YOU OKAY?

30:00.667 --> 30:03.400
I'M SO SORRY
I LOST OUR BABY.

30:03.433 --> 30:05.100
I'M SO SORRY.

30:05.133 --> 30:06.700
(sobs)

30:06.733 --> 30:08.400
SHH. IT'S OKAY.

30:08.433 --> 30:11.267
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
ALL RIGHT?

30:11.300 --> 30:12.600
(sniffles and whimpers)

30:12.633 --> 30:14.533
REMEMBER, WE NEED TO STAY
IN SYNC.

30:14.567 --> 30:16.767
READY? GO.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.700
GOOD. EASY. SLOW, SLOW.
SLOW DOWN.

30:18.733 --> 30:21.633
RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE.
GOOD.

30:21.667 --> 30:23.767
(monitor beeping erratically)
HER PRESSURE'S RISING.

30:23.800 --> 30:27.133
SHE'S GETTING BRADYCARDIC.
OKAY, SO LET'S PUSH 1 GRAM
PER KILO OF MANNITOL,

30:27.167 --> 30:28.500
20 LASIX.

30:28.533 --> 30:30.500
SEE IF WE CAN AVOID
INCREASED I.C.P.

30:30.533 --> 30:34.533
(beeping continues)

30:36.800 --> 30:38.767
(clears throat)

30:38.800 --> 30:41.033
IS THERE A PROBLEM,
DR. GREY?

30:41.067 --> 30:43.067
ANDRE'S HERE.

30:43.100 --> 30:47.633
(beeping continues)

30:58.133 --> 31:00.267
YOU RUN EVERYWHERE,

31:00.300 --> 31:02.200
OR IS IT JUST
YOU'RE SCARED OF ME?

31:02.233 --> 31:03.800
I'M JUST TRYING TO STAY
ON TOP OF THINGS.

31:03.833 --> 31:07.000
WELL, YOU'RE DOING A FINE JOB.
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE WORK.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.067
SIR, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
MENTIONING TO THE CHIEF

31:12.100 --> 31:14.167
THAT YOU LIKE MY WORK...

31:14.200 --> 31:16.233
I WAS HELD BACK
AS AN INTERN.

31:16.267 --> 31:19.233
THERE WAS SOME PERSONAL...
STUFF. I'M GOOD.

31:19.267 --> 31:21.767
AND, UH, IF YOU WOULD
SAY SOMETHING TO HIM--

31:21.800 --> 31:24.267
UH, WEBBER WOULD NOT HAVE MADE
THAT DECISION LIGHTLY.

31:24.300 --> 31:28.067
LEARNING IS LIKE,
UM, HEALING,

31:28.100 --> 31:30.200
IT HAPPENS OVER TIME.

31:30.233 --> 31:33.133
***

31:33.167 --> 31:34.800
LISTEN...

31:34.833 --> 31:36.767
KEEP RUNNING.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.700
BUT NOT BECAUSE
YOU WANT TO CUT CORNERS.

31:38.733 --> 31:41.167
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU
A BETTER DOCTOR.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.467
(door opens)

31:42.500 --> 31:44.400
YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING.

31:44.433 --> 31:46.800
O'LEARY AND I WERE JUST,
UH, MARVELING AT THE FACT

31:46.833 --> 31:48.733
THAT YOU HAVEN'T
KILLED ME YET.

31:48.767 --> 31:50.233
WELL,
THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW.

31:50.267 --> 31:52.600
CHECK HIS POST-OP ECHO

31:52.633 --> 31:54.533
AND MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO RESIDUAL PROLAPSE.

31:54.567 --> 31:55.800
YES, SIR.

32:12.767 --> 32:14.133

DON'T ASK ME IF I'M OKAY.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.833
OKAY.

32:17.867 --> 32:21.100
(scoffs) YOU MAKE ME SICK.
HAVE SOME FIRE.

32:21.133 --> 32:23.467
BE UNSTOPPABLE.
BE A FORCE OF NATURE.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.400
BE BETTER THAN ANYONE HERE,

32:25.433 --> 32:27.333
AND DON'T GIVE A DAMN
WHAT ANYONE THINKS.

32:27.367 --> 32:30.367
THERE ARE NO TEAMS HERE,
NO BUDDIES.

32:30.400 --> 32:33.267
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
BE ON YOUR OWN.

32:33.300 --> 32:36.400

32:38.433 --> 32:40.800
DR. YANG...
I JUST SCRUBBED IN

32:40.833 --> 32:43.467
ON WALTER TAPLEY'S
DOUBLE VALVE REPLACEMENT.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.767
I WATCHED DR. HAHN EXCISE
A PIECE OF HIS PERICARDIUM

32:46.800 --> 32:48.767
FROM, LIKE, 3 INCHES AWAY.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.667
THAT'S WHAT I GOT TO DO
WHILE YOU MADE NOTES IN CHARTS.

32:51.700 --> 32:55.267
SO WHATEVER CRAP YOU WANT TO
RAIN DOWN ON MY HEAD, GO FOR IT.

32:55.300 --> 32:58.700
BECAUSE I JUST SAW THE INSIDE
OF WALTER TAPLEY'S HEART,

32:58.733 --> 33:00.233
AND THAT IS SOMETHING

33:00.267 --> 33:02.700
THAT YOU WILL NEVER
TAKE AWAY FROM ME.

HEY, TUCK. HERE'S TAPLEY'S FILE.
THE NEW LABS ARE IN THERE.

33:17.533 --> 33:19.833
JUST PUT IT ON THE PILE.
TUCKER DIDN'T TAKE HIM?

33:19.867 --> 33:22.533
I WANTED THE EVENING
WITH HIM.

33:22.567 --> 33:25.667
YOU GUYS GET TO THE BOTTOM

33:27.800 --> 33:30.733
WHY DON'T I TAKE TUCK

33:30.767 --> 33:33.400
YOU CAN GO TALK TO HIM,
GO FIGHT WITH HIM.

33:33.433 --> 33:35.367
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIX ANYTHING
IN ONE DAY, BUT YOU CAN GO ON

33:35.400 --> 33:37.300

SHE'S STAYING WITH ME
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

33:46.333 --> 33:48.467
SHE DIDN'T BRING ENOUGH STUFF.
DID YOU CALL HER HUSBAND?

33:48.500 --> 33:50.400
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK TO HIM.

33:50.433 --> 33:52.567
DID YOU GET A PSYCH CONSULT?
ALEX, HEY.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.500
(whispers) SHE HAD
A HYSTERICAL PREGNANCY.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.133
SLOAN THINKS SHE MAY HAVE
A STRESS D--
SHE'S FINE, OKAY?

33:57.167 --> 33:59.067
I CAN HANDLE IT.
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF HER.

33:59.100 --> 34:02.267

SOME DAMN GIRL CLOTHES.

HAHN IS SEEING HIM NOW.

34:27.267 --> 34:30.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH BAILEY'S CHILD?

34:30.333 --> 34:32.233
DR. BAILEY
AND I ARE IN LOVE,

34:32.267 --> 34:34.133
AND I'LL BE HEADING BACK
TO VEGAS WITH HER

34:34.167 --> 34:36.733
AS SOON AS MY DIVORCE
FROM DR. TORRES IS FINAL.

34:36.767 --> 34:38.567
WE NEED
TO WRITE ADELE AGAIN.

34:38.600 --> 34:42.067
SHE REPLIED TO MY E-MAIL,
BUT ALL SHE SENT WAS A TYPO.

34:42.100 --> 34:44.433
SHE'S NO BETTER AT THIS
THAN I AM. HERE.

34:44.467 --> 34:47.667
THAT'S NOT A TYPO, SIR.
THAT'S A WINK.
NO, THAT'S A SEMICOLON
AND CLOSE PARENTHESES.

34:47.700 --> 34:49.600
TURN IT SIDEWAYS.

34:49.633 --> 34:51.700
WELL, WHAT THE HELL
DOES THIS MEAN?

34:51.733 --> 34:54.133
SHE'S FLIRTING, SIR.

34:54.167 --> 34:56.800
OH. OH--OH, THAT'S GOOD.
YEAH.

34:56.833 --> 34:59.300
O'MALLEY.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.133
GOOD WORK TODAY.

35:05.600 --> 35:09.033
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS?
THAT WAS THE ATTABOY.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.400
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN

35:10.433 --> 35:12.367
THE MOST EXHAUSTING DAY
OF MY LIFE,

35:12.400 --> 35:14.300
MY BACK IS KILLING ME--
NO OFFENSE--

35:14.333 --> 35:18.067
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN THE INSIDE
OF AN O.R. IN...

35:18.100 --> 35:20.800
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG,
BUT--BUT I GOT THE ATTABOY.

35:20.833 --> 35:23.133
I'M TURNING IT AROUND.

35:23.167 --> 35:25.067
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET
THE PUNCHING UNDER CONTROL,

35:25.100 --> 35:26.100
RIGHT?

35:26.133 --> 35:28.033
OH, YOU AND ME,
YOU KNOW,

35:28.067 --> 35:32.833
BOY, IT TAKES US A WHILE,
BUT WE GET THERE.

35:32.867 --> 35:36.500
WE REACHED THE TUMOR.

35:37.800 --> 35:41.533
BUT THERE WAS SWELLING
IN GRETA'S BRAIN.

35:41.567 --> 35:43.533
WE DID AN M.R.I.,

35:43.567 --> 35:46.133
AND IT SUGGESTED THAT
THE SWELLING

35:46.167 --> 35:48.767
IN HER BRAIN
CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE.

35:48.800 --> 35:52.400
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
SHE'S GONNA WAKE UP.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.433
MR. BARRET...

35:56.467 --> 35:59.033
WE'RE SO SORRY.

35:59.067 --> 36:02.433
WE SHOULD'VE WAITED.

36:02.467 --> 36:05.333
WE DIDN'T THINK...

36:08.867 --> 36:11.133
THE WHOLE STORY

36:11.167 --> 36:13.200
JUST SOUNDED SO INCREDIBLE.

36:13.233 --> 36:17.100
YEAH. SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT
THE SHOE, RIGHT?

36:17.133 --> 36:19.033
MM-HMM.

36:19.067 --> 36:22.800
IT MAKES US BOTH
SOUND CRAZY.

36:22.833 --> 36:28.200
I COULD NEVER GET THAT IMAGE
OUT OF MY HEAD...

36:28.233 --> 36:31.233
HER RUNNING UP THE GANGPLANK
WITH ONE SHOE,

36:31.267 --> 36:32.600
WIND IN HER HAIR.

36:32.633 --> 36:36.167
MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

36:37.733 --> 36:40.300
SHE MIGHT WAKE UP, RIGHT?

36:40.333 --> 36:43.500
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A FAIRY TALE
FROM THE START.

36:43.533 --> 36:45.433
THEY ALWAYS WAKE UP.

36:45.467 --> 36:48.467
***

36:51.267 --> 36:54.300
DON'T WONDER
WHY PEOPLE GO CRAZY.

36:55.633 --> 36:58.400
WONDER WHY THEY DON'T.

36:58.433 --> 37:01.267

37:01.300 --> 37:04.667
***

37:10.067 --> 37:12.767

(Andre sobbing)

37:14.833 --> 37:16.733
IN AN INSTANT...

37:16.767 --> 37:19.767
***

37:21.600 --> 37:25.367
WONDER WHAT THE HELL IT IS...

37:28.833 --> 37:31.700

WHEN I WAS A KID...

40:09.067 --> 40:13.033
AFTER THE LOVE OF HER LIFE
DISAPPEARED.

TOLD ANYBODY THAT BEFORE.
