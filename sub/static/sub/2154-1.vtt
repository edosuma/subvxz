01:43.360 --> 01:45.408
<i>This is J.T.L. Morning News.</i>

01:45.480 --> 01:47.448
<i>This is Holly Chadwick.</i>

01:47.520 --> 01:48.646
Thanks for joining us.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.405
<i>We have a great show
in store for you this morning.</i>

01:51.480 --> 01:54.131
<i>Well, it's
a great morning to be in the studio.</i>

01:54.200 --> 01:56.407
<i>Authorities have
confirmed an avian flu outbreak.</i>

01:56.480 --> 01:57.845
<i>Forecast, cloudy skies...</i>

01:57.920 --> 01:59.922
<i>Good morning.
Reporting from Brighton.</i>

02:01.320 --> 02:03.049
<i>This
will be a different scenario</i>

02:03.120 --> 02:06.488
<i>if the virus changes in a way that allows
transmission between humans.</i>

02:06.560 --> 02:08.085
- So, let's get started.

02:09.800 --> 02:10.925
<i>Yet again today,</i>

02:11.000 --> 02:14.049
<i>another group of dolphins
became stranded.</i>

02:14.240 --> 02:17.050
CO2 emissions have
dramatically increased in...

02:17.240 --> 02:19.129
<i>Are there any
real threats that you know of?</i>

02:19.240 --> 02:20.446
Not at all.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.210
<i>Environmentalists are trying</i>

02:22.280 --> 02:23.691
<i>to determine the cause of death.</i>

02:23.800 --> 02:25.484
<i>At alert level six,</i>

02:25.560 --> 02:27.642
<i>W.H.O. guidelines for governments...</i>

02:27.720 --> 02:30.041
Your socks are so cute! I like them.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.921
Police say they've seen
similar cases recently

02:32.120 --> 02:33.690
<i>of people behaving strangely.</i>

02:33.760 --> 02:36.161
<i>The U.N.
health agency is not likely</i>

02:36.240 --> 02:38.641
<i>to recommend official travel restrictions.</i>

02:38.760 --> 02:40.444
<i>It's a little bit unsettling.</i>

02:40.520 --> 02:43.000
<i>They're not physicists.
They're not engineers.</i>

02:43.080 --> 02:44.366
They think it's just gonna go away.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.080
They live in a fantasy parallel universe.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.601
<i>Right on top
of the man, beating him.</i>

02:49.680 --> 02:50.841
<i>The man is bleeding.</i>

02:50.920 --> 02:52.251
<i>Twenty-one
confirmed cases.</i>

02:52.320 --> 02:55.642
All the talk
about a doomsday is a big hoax.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.131
<i>The subject growled at him</i>

02:57.200 --> 02:59.248
<i>and continued to maul the victim.</i>

02:59.320 --> 03:02.642
<i>The best estimate
is about 15,000 in the U.K.</i>

03:02.760 --> 03:04.000
<i>We don't
know if this is spreading.</i>

03:04.120 --> 03:05.451
<i>Rhythms of change...</i>

03:05.520 --> 03:07.522
<i>So far
there's no manifestation.</i>

03:10.600 --> 03:13.524
<i>Monitors have arrived,
even carrying them...</i>

03:13.600 --> 03:14.886
<i>With that much
public at risk, we cannot...</i>

03:14.960 --> 03:18.081
<i>They're trying to move us on,
trying to tell the journalists to get out.</i>

03:34.120 --> 03:35.281
Wake up!

03:36.120 --> 03:38.407
- Oh, creatures in our bed...

03:40.560 --> 03:42.767
- No sleeping!

03:43.000 --> 03:44.570
Oh, you're getting very big.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.564
- What do you want to eat?
- Pancakes!

03:48.600 --> 03:50.011
<i>We got a lot more sunshine today.</i>

03:50.160 --> 03:52.481
You have to only say one word.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.320
Hey, by the way,
what do you want for your birthday?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.407
Say a puppy.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.567
A puppy.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.404
You mean
a stuffed animal puppy?

03:59.480 --> 04:01.005
Because that we can do.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.931
<i>Scusi.</i>

04:04.000 --> 04:06.162
Good morning.
That looks yummy.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.724
She gets the bigger one?

04:08.840 --> 04:10.410
- Yeah, sorry.
- She's tiny.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.363
Did you pack your, um, inhaler?

04:13.560 --> 04:14.686
Bathroom sink.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.081
- In a minute?
- Scootch! Go.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.767
<i>The government
has declared martial law.</i>

04:19.839 --> 04:21.603
Daddy, what's martial law?

04:21.920 --> 04:23.649
Uh...

04:23.720 --> 04:27.202
Martial law is like house rules,
but for everybody.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.561
Were you ever
in places like that with your old job?

04:31.720 --> 04:32.881
Mmm-hmm.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.641
But I quit my old job
so I could be with you.

04:35.920 --> 04:36.967
Do you miss it?

04:41.200 --> 04:42.406
No, I like my new job.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.205
All you do is make pancakes
in the morning!

04:45.320 --> 04:46.600
Yeah, but I'm really good at it.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.405
Look who I found!
- Oh!

04:49.000 --> 04:50.331
<i>Here comes the number 12 train!</i>

04:50.400 --> 04:51.765
It's not Subway Sam, is it?

04:52.320 --> 04:54.561
You want more pancakes?

04:55.160 --> 04:56.525
Good.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.967
Go, go, go. Come on, scootch!

04:59.040 --> 05:00.804
- At least...
- Move it on out.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.769
Hey! Plates in the sink!

05:02.840 --> 05:04.681
- Later!
- Do that when we get back!

05:10.480 --> 05:13.165
Uh... Does it live in the jungle?

05:15.080 --> 05:16.241
Oooh.

05:16.440 --> 05:17.441
No.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.806
Do you eat it on Sundays?

05:18.920 --> 05:19.967
No.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.924
Does it live
on the Great Plains of Africa?

05:23.400 --> 05:25.528
- Yeah.
- Oh, well, I guess, yeah.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.922
Do people keep it in pens all its
life and harvest it for meat?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.604
- That's really gross!
- Gross!

05:30.680 --> 05:31.727
Dad!

05:31.800 --> 05:33.962
Is it an animal you'd have for a pet?

05:34.080 --> 05:35.605
- Yes.
- Is it a cat?

05:35.720 --> 05:37.041
- Yes.
Ha ha ha.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.200
- Okay, now we have another one.
- Do another one.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.083
- You totally got one!

05:41.200 --> 05:42.361
Why are there so many?

05:42.440 --> 05:44.120
It's like, three in the last five minutes.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.040
- What is going on?

05:51.760 --> 05:53.285
<i>The World
Health Organization has been</i>

05:53.360 --> 05:55.169
<i>tracking the recent outbreak of rabies</i>

05:55.240 --> 05:59.006
<i>that began in Taiwan and has now been
reported in over 12 countries.</i>

05:59.080 --> 06:02.129
<i>Responding to allegations he hasn't
done enough to prevent the spread...</i>

06:02.280 --> 06:03.611
Can we try BBC?

06:04.480 --> 06:06.323
You're not British anymore, baby.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.970
You lost your accent a long time ago.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.408
Except after two bottles of wine.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.726
Am I British?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.006
Yeah, your grandma is.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.961
- Hey!
- Yo!

06:17.960 --> 06:19.450
He's just gonna keep going, Daddy?

06:19.520 --> 06:20.521
Hold on, guys.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.687
Daddy, be careful on the road.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.450
It's okay, baby.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.450
<i>Can be
transmitted between species</i>

06:29.520 --> 06:31.841
<i>commonly from a bite
from an infected animal.</i>

06:37.200 --> 06:40.170
<i>Our best recommendation is to stay
away from densely populated areas.</i>

06:40.440 --> 06:42.010
Hey, yo! You all right?

06:42.080 --> 06:43.286
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.601
- You need anything?
- No. You know what's going on?

06:45.680 --> 06:47.170
No, man, I don't know anything.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.645
It's crazy.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.961
Gerry?

06:59.840 --> 07:02.161
Get back in your car right now!

07:03.520 --> 07:05.170
Remain with your ve...

07:12.160 --> 07:13.161
What are we doing?

07:13.240 --> 07:14.601
That's our way out of here.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.724
I want my blanket!

07:37.800 --> 07:38.921
Baby, it's packed right now.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.325
Snuggle with Subway Sam, okay?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.445
My blanket!

07:53.920 --> 07:54.921
Rach?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.082
Rachel, baby, you've got
to get back in your seat.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.609
- Baby, we need you in your seat.
- Put your belt on!

07:59.680 --> 08:00.920
Rachel, right now!

08:01.080 --> 08:02.809
- Gerry?
- Rach, get your belt back on!

08:14.760 --> 08:16.091
- You okay?
- You okay?

08:16.200 --> 08:18.009
- Rachel, sweetheart?
- Rachel, you hurt?

08:18.880 --> 08:21.008
- Connie?
- Are you okay? It's okay.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.561
We should get out.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.971
Everybody out of the car.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.322
We've got to get out of the city.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.568
Her door won't open!
Rachel, go out that side.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.206
Okay, you have to climb over, honey.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.725
Out of the way!

08:51.560 --> 08:52.800
Move it!

08:57.680 --> 08:59.125
Come on, honey. Come on.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.283
Sweetheart, are you okay?

09:34.680 --> 09:36.762
Let's go. Let's get off the street.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.245
What is that, Gerry? What is that?

09:48.320 --> 09:49.526
I don't know!

09:50.080 --> 09:51.445
Get to the RV.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.567
Subway Sam!

09:52.640 --> 09:55.484
<i>Here comes the number 12 train! One.</i>

09:57.360 --> 09:58.407
<i>Two.</i>

09:59.040 --> 10:01.042
- What's happening?
<i>- Three.</i>

10:01.880 --> 10:02.927
<i>Four.</i>

10:03.680 --> 10:05.205
<i>- Five.</i>

10:06.600 --> 10:07.965
<i>Six.</i>

10:08.280 --> 10:09.406
<i>Seven.</i>

10:10.480 --> 10:11.481
<i>- Eight.</i>

10:12.600 --> 10:13.886
<i>Nine.</i>

10:14.600 --> 10:16.011
<i>Ten.</i>

10:16.720 --> 10:18.210
<i>Eleven.</i>

10:19.040 --> 10:20.246
<i>Twelve.</i>

10:22.520 --> 10:24.204
<i>Train's in the station!</i>

10:46.880 --> 10:48.120
Gerry!

10:49.560 --> 10:51.210
- Watch out!

11:30.720 --> 11:33.451
<i>We're pulling
back on Fifth Street!</i>

11:33.520 --> 11:35.170
<i>Containment is a fail.</i>

11:48.200 --> 11:49.929
- Try to relax.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.805
Give yourself air.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.651
In and out.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.806
- Come on, baby, try to relax.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.886
Gerry? We left my purse in the car.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.166
Where's her spare?

12:01.920 --> 12:04.810
I'm gonna go check
your backpack, all right?

12:05.160 --> 12:07.208
Do you want to be with her?

12:15.160 --> 12:17.640
Rach, you'll be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.081
Hey, hey, you breathe
through your nose.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.847
Rach, Rach, look at me. Look at me.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.170
You're gonna be all right.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.081
You've done this a hundred times.
Look at me. Look at me.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.125
Breathe in through your nose,
out through your mouth.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.281
Okay, we're gonna go to a pharmacy.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.010
We gotta move.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.126
Okay.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.801
Good. Good. Look.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.480
Look at me, look at me.
Rach, breathe through your nose.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.925
No, no, no, no...

12:46.000 --> 12:47.570
You're gonna be all right.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.400
- Look at me.
- Daddy, what are those things?

12:49.480 --> 12:51.562
Honey, find us some water.
Okay? Something to drink.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.167
It's Thierry.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.401
Where are you?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.367
<i>Airborne.
Lower East Side to Turtle Bay.</i>

13:04.080 --> 13:06.162
It's all gone. We barely made it out.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.680
- Tell him to go south.
- No, no, we need visual confirmation.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.760
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.441
What is this?

13:12.560 --> 13:14.050
We don't know. How close were you?

13:14.520 --> 13:15.567
Face to face.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.045
Good, honey, good.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.121
Daddy.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.489
Connie, give me that.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.050
Give me that. Oh, thank you, honey.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.441
<i>Where are you?</i>

13:25.520 --> 13:26.806
95, heading north.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.889
- Okay. Okay.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.203
<i>All right.
We'll try to get a helicopter to you.</i>

13:33.280 --> 13:35.282
I'll call you back with
an extraction point.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.488
<i>Can you hold out for another hour?</i>

13:37.560 --> 13:39.085
Do we have a choice?

13:39.160 --> 13:40.844
<i>This is not
for old time's sake, my friend.</i>

13:41.080 --> 13:42.286
I'll need you.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.244
<i>I need you back.</i>

13:44.400 --> 13:45.447
Don't forget about us.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.010
What do you mean, we've lost Boston?

13:47.080 --> 13:48.570
All right. Good luck, Gerry.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.727
Okay.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.804
Good, honey. Keep it going.
It's gonna be all right.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.967
- Come here. Stay close.
- Super close.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.610
Take my hand.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.568
Get her medicine,
I'll get us something to eat.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.563
I'll meet you back here.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.044
Stay close, honey.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.370
What do you need?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.007
Albuterol.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.521
They outgrow the asthma supposedly.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.282
And this shit, too. It's magic for my kid.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.524
Thank you.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.168
- Daddy!
- Connie?

15:27.160 --> 15:28.446
Daddy!

15:28.520 --> 15:30.488
- Connie?
- Daddy!

15:30.760 --> 15:32.040
- Where's Mommy?
- Gerry!

15:32.560 --> 15:33.891
Gerry!

15:34.120 --> 15:35.281
Karin?

15:35.840 --> 15:37.888
- Karin?
- Gerry! Gerry!

15:38.040 --> 15:40.566
Get off of me!
Get off of me! That's all I have.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.205
- Gerry!
- Hey!

15:43.680 --> 15:45.523
- Hey!
- Gerry.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.801
<i>Multiple 11-99s at Washington Park.</i>

16:05.880 --> 16:08.645
<i>Please, send units.
We're falling back on Reed Street.</i>

16:08.800 --> 16:10.643
<i>Two Robert
12, units need backup.</i>

16:10.720 --> 16:12.643
<i>Mobile ops is down. Please respond.</i>

16:12.720 --> 16:14.290
<i>Two Robert 12, are you there? Copy.</i>

16:14.400 --> 16:15.880
- Girls!
<i>- Responders, Code 3, Code 3.</i>

16:15.920 --> 16:18.082
Rachel, quick, come on.

16:24.680 --> 16:25.886
No.

16:26.760 --> 16:27.886
No!

16:28.400 --> 16:30.926
We got to get out of here.
We got to get off the street.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.081
Gerry.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.965
Apartments?

16:35.920 --> 16:37.251
Hey. Yeah.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.764
- Gerry?
<i>- We're in Newark.</i>

16:46.840 --> 16:48.171
We're stranded.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.844
Apartment buildings, 23rd.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.161
If we can get to the roof,
can you get someone to us?

16:52.280 --> 16:53.611
<i>- Not tonight.</i>
- When?

16:53.760 --> 16:54.807
<i>The earliest would be sunrise.</i>

16:54.920 --> 16:55.887
Sunrise.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.405
Tell him I got flares.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.608
<i>We'll be on the roof with flares.</i>

16:59.680 --> 17:02.126
Listen, Gerry, I will move
mountains to get you out here.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.930
- Come here, baby.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.003
Go! Go! Go!

17:23.200 --> 17:24.964
- Baby, in here!
- Come on. Quick!

17:25.599 --> 17:26.681
Gerry!

17:36.080 --> 17:37.366
Inside, girls!

17:37.440 --> 17:39.329
By the stairs. Inside, inside!

17:40.960 --> 17:42.803
Wait!

17:44.760 --> 17:45.761
Wait.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.691
Up, up. It's okay, baby.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.969
Run! Run! Go, Rachel!

17:55.040 --> 17:56.087
Go!

17:56.160 --> 17:57.525
Go!

17:59.000 --> 18:00.365
Keep running, baby.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.808
- It's all right.
- To the top.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.166
Go! Go!

18:13.560 --> 18:14.561
Go!

18:29.040 --> 18:30.041
Run!

18:37.560 --> 18:39.210
Go! Go! Go! Go!

18:40.040 --> 18:41.280
I need a new flare!

18:41.960 --> 18:44.008
This asshole's about to get through!

18:53.880 --> 18:55.882
Where's Connie? Connie?

18:56.200 --> 18:57.850
- Connie?
- Connie!

18:58.000 --> 18:59.968
- Let me in!
- Connie!

19:12.160 --> 19:14.208
- Baby?
- It's not her. It's not her.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.609
- Let me in!
- Connie!

19:16.680 --> 19:18.011
Let me in!

19:23.080 --> 19:24.889
In, in, in! In!

19:33.240 --> 19:34.526
Thank you so much.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.523
- I'm Tomas.
- Hey, Tomas.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.728
My mom's cooking everything
before it starts to stink.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.201
That's smart.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.406
You guys all right?

19:44.480 --> 19:45.606
It's all right.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.486
It's okay.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.165
Are you guys hungry?

19:50.240 --> 19:51.605
Yes, thank you.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.484
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.803
- Thank you.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.245
You want some juice?

20:22.320 --> 20:23.321
<i>The following message</i>

Hmm.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.485
Thanks, Tommy.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.685
I used to work in dangerous places

21:48.760 --> 21:51.843
and people who moved survived,
and those who didn't...

21:54.720 --> 21:57.326
Movement is life.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.565
You have a better chance
if you come with us.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.282
You need anything else

22:58.000 --> 23:00.321
Okay. Come on. Come on.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.730
We should have left with them.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.126
There is nowhere to go.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.168
What's going to happen
when the food is gone?

23:38.160 --> 23:39.924
Okay, come on.

23:43.480 --> 23:44.845
I'm scared.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.209
Connie, there's a helicopter
waiting for us on the roof.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.926
Keep your eyes
on Mommy and Daddy, okay?

23:51.120 --> 23:52.360
Be ninja quiet.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.843
Just a walk in the park.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.523
How do we know they're coming?

23:57.960 --> 23:59.450
They're coming.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.521
Ready?

24:16.720 --> 24:18.722
- Okay, come on, guys.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.645
Come on! Come on!

24:26.640 --> 24:27.721
Up, up, up.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.326
Come on, baby.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.965
Go, go, go!

24:32.120 --> 24:34.282
- Come on, baby!
- Go, go!

24:34.480 --> 24:36.562
Go, girls! Gerry!

24:37.880 --> 24:39.120
Come on. Gerry!

24:39.200 --> 24:40.611
Girls, get back!

24:42.120 --> 24:43.804
Watch out!

24:54.440 --> 24:56.329
- Go!
- Go, go, go!

24:56.520 --> 24:58.170
Come on, faster, girls!

25:01.280 --> 25:03.282
<i>Lieutenant, I've got no contact.</i>

25:03.360 --> 25:05.124
<i>I say again, no contact.</i>

25:05.880 --> 25:07.800
Let's go, let's go!

25:09.440 --> 25:10.601
Karin!

25:10.680 --> 25:12.045
- Karin!
- Yeah.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.606
Go through the door!

25:17.440 --> 25:18.601
Gerry?

25:56.120 --> 25:58.043
<i>There they are!
Ace, we have positive contact.</i>

25:58.160 --> 25:59.810
That's our target! Get us down!

25:59.880 --> 26:00.961
Daddy!

26:01.120 --> 26:02.929
- Daddy!
- Baby, get back.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.491
Daddy!

26:04.560 --> 26:05.561
Gerry?

26:05.640 --> 26:07.244
- Gerry, what?
- Stay back!

26:07.320 --> 26:08.731
Baby! No!

26:08.800 --> 26:10.165
One thousand seven.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.730
One thousand eight.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.490
Daddy, get off the edge!

26:13.560 --> 26:16.006
- Gerry, please?
- One thousand ten.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.684
One thousand eleven.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.124
I got it in my mouth.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.641
You're okay. You're okay.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.170
- Go! Go!

26:36.320 --> 26:37.731
Come on. Come on.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.361
Let's go! Let's go!

26:47.640 --> 26:49.483
Come on, let's go! We got to go!

26:53.920 --> 26:55.081
You got her?

27:07.880 --> 27:09.689
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

27:32.480 --> 27:35.324
<i>Traffic en route,
altitude 5-7 thousand.</i>

27:35.400 --> 27:39.007
<i>Heading 250. Turn right,
heading 075, once clear.</i>

27:39.920 --> 27:41.684
<i>Remain below 4,000.</i>

27:56.160 --> 28:00.484
<i>Clear to land,
heading 040, wind 060 at five.</i>

28:01.960 --> 28:05.123
<i>Follow L.S.O. directions.
Prep for immediate dust off.</i>

28:28.200 --> 28:29.406
Gerry.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.965
Thank you.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.042
Good to see you, my friend.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.921
<i>Tango five,
this is Argus command.</i>

28:34.960 --> 28:36.121
<i>Cleared for take-off.</i>

28:36.400 --> 28:38.323
<i>Tango five. Wilco.</i>

28:57.280 --> 28:58.520
Karin, to the right.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.330
This is good, right?

29:00.400 --> 29:02.084
Bunk beds!

29:02.160 --> 29:05.130
Your bunk beds
are number two, three and six.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.680
Please make yourself at home.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.171
You want to get up here?

29:08.920 --> 29:11.764
- There you go, sweetheart.
- That's good.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.649
<i>We're not dropping anchor again.</i>

29:14.120 --> 29:15.246
You're safe.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.446
It's not me I'm worried about.

29:16.520 --> 29:17.965
They're safe.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.005
Baby.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.886
It's bigger than
our old apartment on 72nd.

29:25.120 --> 29:26.326
Need anything, Karin?

29:26.840 --> 29:27.887
Water.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.607
I'll organize.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.601
Is this worldwide?
Is anyone doing better than we are?

29:34.800 --> 29:37.041
Baby. Go talk somewhere else.

29:37.680 --> 29:38.806
Okay.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.206
The President is dead.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.205
Four of six Joint Chiefs. V.P. missing.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.644
Reports of gun battles
in the streets of the capital.

29:56.720 --> 29:57.881
Your parties are panicking.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.365
The bigger cities are the worst off.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.410
The airlines
were the perfect delivery system.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.928
Carnival cruise vessel Dream
has been given permission to join.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.726
<i>Twenty seven knots south and closing.</i>

30:11.040 --> 30:13.088
How soon are they showing
symptoms after contact?

30:13.240 --> 30:15.041
The provisional
government currently considers

30:15.080 --> 30:16.525
northern Minnesota
to be a potential safe zone.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.360
Have you recorded
any instance where a person

30:18.400 --> 30:19.925
was bitten but not infected?

30:25.600 --> 30:27.443
How the hell do I know
if Russia's fallen?

30:32.080 --> 30:34.048
Sir, I cannot action that order.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.849
Colonel, I'm sorry,
but we cannot facilitate

30:35.920 --> 30:37.763
an evacuation for you or your men.

30:38.040 --> 30:41.044
Sir, there is nowhere to evacuate you to.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.882
Malnutrition. Dirty water.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.443
No gas for the winter or transportation.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.684
No bullets to fight.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.561
And it has spread
to all corners of the globe.

30:50.600 --> 30:51.965
The question
that we have got to address

30:52.120 --> 30:53.360
is what the hell is it?

30:53.440 --> 30:55.681
About 5% of the population
aren't affected immediately.

30:55.760 --> 30:59.606
It is viral. it has to be viral.
There is no plausible alternative.

30:59.960 --> 31:03.885
And like any virus, once we find its
origin, we can develop a vaccine.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.611
- We find it, contain it...
- That's Dr. Fassbach.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.526
Virologist from Harvard.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.080
The analogy I keep coming back to

31:11.320 --> 31:12.651
is Spanish Flu.

31:12.800 --> 31:13.847
Spanish Flu?

31:13.960 --> 31:16.008
It didn't exist in 1918, but by 1920,

31:16.080 --> 31:18.048
it killed 3% Of the world.

31:18.240 --> 31:21.528
He's our best bet
at figuring out what this thing is.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.485
You all read the same email I did,

31:23.800 --> 31:26.531
- and it said "zombies."

31:26.600 --> 31:28.887
Are you completely out of your mind?

31:28.960 --> 31:31.531
So, the earliest mention
of the word "zombie"

31:31.600 --> 31:34.410
was in a memo
from Camp Humphreys in South Korea.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.244
We haven't had contact with them since.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.685
But this could lead us to the origin.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.524
If we knew where this thing started,

31:39.600 --> 31:42.683
then we'd have a chance
of developing a vaccine to stop it.

31:42.760 --> 31:45.604
So we send in Dr. Fassbach
there to look for the source.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.205
He's just a kid.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.241
You're right.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.685
Attention on deck!

31:56.200 --> 31:57.326
At ease!

32:00.320 --> 32:02.163
Mr. Under-Secretary.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.685
The Under-Secretary
here says you were

32:05.760 --> 32:08.445
his best investigator
when you were at the U.N.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.921
I want to send you in. With a team.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.004
Help Dr. Fassbach
find whatever it is he needs.

32:14.760 --> 32:15.761
You brought...

32:15.840 --> 32:17.842
I wanted for the circumstances
to speak for themselves.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.046
No.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.682
Captain, I'm not your guy.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.849
You were on the ground
during the Liberian Civil War.

32:27.040 --> 32:30.601
Investigated Chechen war crimes.
Sri Lanka in '07.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.690
Places you and I both know
Dr. Fassbach wouldn't last a night in.

32:33.760 --> 32:36.206
Gerry, a handful of SEALs
will go with you as security force.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.327
No.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.482
My guys will get you in,
you assist the doctor,

32:39.600 --> 32:41.648
pursue any leads,
my guys will get you out.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.570
We do the heavy lifting.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.728
I can't help you. I can't leave my family.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.888
Take a look around here, Mr. Lane.

32:52.400 --> 32:56.644
Each and every one of these people are
here because they serve a purpose.

32:58.240 --> 33:01.403
There's no room here
for non-essential personnel.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.125
There's a long line of people

33:03.240 --> 33:05.004
waiting for one of those bunks.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.449
You want to help your family,

33:09.560 --> 33:12.211
let's figure out how we stop this.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.922
It's your choice, Mr. Lane.

33:15.240 --> 33:16.401
Simple.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.371
<i>You don't work for them anymore.</i>

33:20.440 --> 33:21.885
- Karin...
- You might not remember

33:21.960 --> 33:24.042
What this job did to you, but I do.

33:24.120 --> 33:26.088
So do not ask me to say yes to this.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.207
I have to go.

33:28.280 --> 33:30.044
They're going to kick us off the ship.

33:31.880 --> 33:32.927
What?

33:33.520 --> 33:36.603
If I go, you, the girls, Tommy,
have a place to stay.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.524
If I don't, we're back in Philly tonight.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.046
What about Thierry?
Can't he do anything?

33:43.520 --> 33:46.603
Men like Thierry
aren't in charge of anything anymore.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.203
You keep this with you.

33:49.280 --> 33:50.281
I'll call in once a day.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.727
As long as I make that call,
everything's gonna be okay.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.090
I'm coming back.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.568
Okay?
We're going to make the best of it.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.451
As we do.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.131
Like we do.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.804
Okay, baby doll,
Daddy's got to go to work.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.010
I'm not a baby.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.166
Okay.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.641
Tall, beautiful, tiny adult.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.081
I'll be back soon.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.366
Yeah?

34:29.800 --> 34:31.688
All right, tough guy...

34:32.280 --> 34:33.360
Take care of the ladies for me?

34:33.440 --> 34:34.487
Yeah.

34:34.600 --> 34:35.761
Deal.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.010
You're awesome.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.007
Daddy's coming back.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.045
This way, sir.

36:00.240 --> 36:01.321
Look.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.606
We don't know what we're walking into.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.728
So we do what they say. Okay.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.360
If they move, we move.
If they stop, we stop.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.124
If things were to get crazy,

36:09.400 --> 36:10.731
just focus on their boots,

36:10.800 --> 36:12.325
focus on their voices,
and we'll be all right.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.841
- Mmm-hmm.
- These guys are hammers.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.684
And to hammers,
everything looks like nails.

36:16.760 --> 36:17.841
I heard that.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.445
You were meant to.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.568
So, you see something that's important,

36:21.640 --> 36:23.847
you call it out and we'll make it happen.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.526
Okay.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.402
You think we're gonna find anything?

36:30.080 --> 36:31.161
Yeah.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.404
Yeah, we're gonna find something.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.764
Mother Nature is a serial killer.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.410
No one's better.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.250
More creative.

36:43.440 --> 36:44.726
But like all serial killers,

36:44.800 --> 36:47.610
she can't help the urge
to want to get caught.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.844
What good are all those brilliant crimes

36:49.920 --> 36:52.002
if no one takes the credit?

36:52.120 --> 36:54.088
So she leaves crumbs.

36:55.120 --> 36:57.200
Now, the hard part,
why you spend a decade in school,

36:57.280 --> 37:00.204
is seeing the crumbs
for the clues they are.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.922
Sometimes the thing you thought

37:03.120 --> 37:06.488
was the most brutal aspect of the virus,

37:07.320 --> 37:09.641
turns out to be the chink in its armor.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.641
And she loves disguising
her weaknesses as strengths.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.685
She's a bitch.

37:30.880 --> 37:33.281
<i>Attention
D.C. has gone dark. I repeat,</i>

37:33.360 --> 37:34.725
D.C. has gone dark.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.808
The Capitol evacuation
has been suspended.

37:37.200 --> 37:41.410
<i>All available resources should be
directed to Naval Station Norfolk.</i>

37:42.680 --> 37:44.808
<i>All
non-essential personnel</i>

37:44.880 --> 37:47.611
<i>given F-6 status
and in groups A through E</i>

37:47.680 --> 37:50.524
<i>need to report
to the flight deck for relocation.</i>

37:51.840 --> 37:54.969
<i>Groups A and B relocating to Orlando</i>

37:55.040 --> 37:57.441
<i>should be on the stern
clear of the landing zone.</i>

37:59.520 --> 38:03.650
<i>I say again, all non-essential
personnel given F-6 status</i>

38:03.760 --> 38:05.762
<i>need to report to the flight deck.</i>

38:05.920 --> 38:08.810
<i>Choppers are inbound
for immediate relocation.</i>

38:17.880 --> 38:19.723
Mommy, is this dinner?

38:20.040 --> 38:21.166
Yes, sweetheart.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.208
Water here tastes funny.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.370
It's jet fuel, young lady.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.131
He's joking.

38:28.240 --> 38:32.086
I wish. Desal has trouble filtering it out.

38:32.880 --> 38:36.282
Probably because
there's too many people on this ship.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.562
Everybody wake up.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.726
<i>We're on approach
to Camp Humphreys.</i>

38:51.800 --> 38:55.168
<i>Most of the base is dark,
and no one is manning the tower.</i>

38:55.240 --> 38:57.280
<i>We're running on fumes,
so there's really no choice,</i>

38:57.320 --> 38:58.731
<i>I've got to put us down.</i>

38:58.800 --> 39:00.131
<i>So buckle up.</i>

39:26.640 --> 39:27.801
Hold up.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.562
Keep your finger off the trigger.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.646
Okay.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.411
Fassbach! Wait!!

40:09.000 --> 40:10.286
Damn it.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.200
Move back!

40:20.320 --> 40:23.130
Friendly! Friendly!
Keep it down. Keep it down.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.009
What is this? What happened to him?

40:25.360 --> 40:26.566
He slipped. He's dead.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.608
Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

40:46.520 --> 40:47.681
Okay, I'm good!

40:48.000 --> 40:50.048
- Who was it? Who fell?
- Skilken.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.202
- Hold! Clear.
- Hold.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.684
I want an ammo count,
then you reload your mags!

40:55.760 --> 40:56.807
Yes, sir!

40:56.880 --> 40:58.803
My boy who just died out there was 23.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.931
He was 23.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.249
You want to tell me why?

41:03.320 --> 41:07.086
Because the guy who just shot
himself, he's a doctor, a virologist.

41:07.760 --> 41:08.886
What are you talking about?

41:08.960 --> 41:10.769
He was supposed
to be our best hope.

41:10.840 --> 41:12.490
Well, he's not our best hope anymore.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.688
Hey.
That guy volunteered to come here.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.205
He didn't have to, you know.

41:16.280 --> 41:17.520
None of them did.

41:17.720 --> 41:20.120
We're still trying to figure out
what the hell this thing is.

41:20.280 --> 41:22.681
Well, shit happens.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.402
The doctor would have
strongly agreed with you.

41:26.480 --> 41:27.970
How do we go about refueling?

41:28.040 --> 41:31.203
When I say so. And very carefully.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.481
The noise, are they drawn to it?

41:34.840 --> 41:37.286
Yeah. Sound draws them.

41:37.640 --> 41:40.041
Body shots only seem
to slow them down.

41:40.120 --> 41:42.600
Head shots do the trick,
but just to be safe

41:42.680 --> 41:44.762
we tend to burn them when we can.

41:45.080 --> 41:47.048
- You fought any Zeke yet?
- Yeah.

41:47.240 --> 41:49.607
- Where?
- Philly. Newark.

41:49.960 --> 41:51.007
Bad?

41:54.040 --> 41:55.361
- What about Houston?
- St. Louis?

41:55.440 --> 41:56.487
- Baltimore?
- Atlanta?

41:56.560 --> 41:57.721
Detroit?

41:57.880 --> 41:59.080
Guys, I'll be honest with you,

41:59.120 --> 42:02.124
I don't know of any place back
home that's doing very well.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.611
All right...

42:05.280 --> 42:08.204
If the other guy was a virologist,
what do you do?

42:08.280 --> 42:11.762
There was a memo
sent from this installation 11 days ago.

42:12.080 --> 42:13.320
It had the word "zombie" in it.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.368
Do you know anything about it?

42:15.440 --> 42:16.521
Yeah.

42:16.920 --> 42:19.321
It was an email, not a memo.

42:19.840 --> 42:22.286
Pretty obvious
nobody back home bothered to read it.

42:27.240 --> 42:30.449
Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room.

42:30.760 --> 42:33.764
Most of them guards.
But all of them were bitten

42:33.840 --> 42:36.047
trying to get this man
handcuffed to the cot.

42:36.440 --> 42:39.489
Now, our colonel
said he was the first one.

42:39.880 --> 42:41.564
This colonel, is he around?

42:41.640 --> 42:42.846
Oh, yeah. He's right here.

42:50.320 --> 42:53.085
The guy who's shackled, do you know

42:53.320 --> 42:55.004
who bit him, what bit him?

42:55.320 --> 42:57.129
He was the base doctor.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.122
<i>He'd just returned from the field.</i>

43:01.440 --> 43:04.364
<i>He'd been sent out
to verify the death of a soldier</i>

43:04.440 --> 43:06.727
<i>who had just gone AWOL
the week before.</i>

43:07.120 --> 43:09.168
<i>Some villagers had found this guy</i>

43:09.240 --> 43:11.891
<i>foaming at the mouth,
oozing some kind of black tar.</i>

43:12.720 --> 43:14.802
<i>Then he tried to bite one of them.</i>

43:14.880 --> 43:17.167
<i>They shot him, tied him up,
threw him in a barn.</i>

43:31.320 --> 43:32.970
That's all we know, except the doctor

43:33.040 --> 43:36.123
comes back here
and begins attacking his patients.

43:36.200 --> 43:38.806
This soldier,
do you know where he came from?

43:39.040 --> 43:40.041
No.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.124
Anyone he might
have come in contact with?

43:43.200 --> 43:44.201
No.

43:44.280 --> 43:45.805
There's got to be records.

43:47.680 --> 43:49.640
You are welcome
to take a look if you want.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.566
Then the origin could
have come from anywhere.

43:55.880 --> 43:56.961
It's a shame you had to fly

43:57.040 --> 43:59.042
all the way out here to figure that out.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.724
How did you all escape this?

44:04.960 --> 44:07.327
The expenditure of ammunition.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.643
Is that how you tweaked your leg?

44:12.480 --> 44:14.369
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

44:15.400 --> 44:18.210
This prick stands right in the mix,

44:18.280 --> 44:19.645
while seven or eight of them

44:19.760 --> 44:21.569
turn Zeke all at the same time.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.722
But they got no time
for OI' Dirty Bastard here.

44:23.800 --> 44:26.167
Biting everything like fat kids love Twix.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.330
Got no time for his lucky ass.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.084
Ain't it obvious I'm charmed?

44:31.400 --> 44:34.449
The ones I saw bitten
turned in 12 seconds. Same here?

44:34.600 --> 44:35.931
Five or 10 minutes.

44:36.080 --> 44:39.368
Yeah, Davidson went
and he turned in 10 minutes.

44:39.680 --> 44:40.841
"Stevie?"

44:40.920 --> 44:44.288
"Captain Spekes! Oh, my God!
My God! My God! Are they eating me?"

44:44.920 --> 44:45.921
Who's that?

44:46.040 --> 44:47.724
Waste no time on that freak.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.201
He's C.I.A.

44:49.280 --> 44:51.203
Got caught selling guns to North Korea.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.611
Davidson,

44:53.120 --> 44:55.282
he turned in 10 minutes.

44:55.600 --> 44:58.968
That doesn't sound viral
to me at all, sports fans!

45:01.920 --> 45:03.729
You're with the C.I.A.?

45:07.360 --> 45:08.725
But they're not with me.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.530
And who are you?

45:16.080 --> 45:17.764
Oh, my God!

45:20.400 --> 45:22.448
Captain, put on the World Music!

45:22.760 --> 45:24.444
The day

45:25.240 --> 45:26.890
is saved!

45:27.640 --> 45:28.801
Why'd you sell guns to the North?

45:28.880 --> 45:29.961
Why not?

45:30.160 --> 45:31.400
Are they surviving this?

45:31.480 --> 45:32.686
Indeed they are.

45:32.760 --> 45:34.250
Using your guns.

45:34.320 --> 45:37.324
Guns are half-measures.

45:37.600 --> 45:38.647
How then?

45:42.080 --> 45:43.206
All right.

46:08.760 --> 46:10.285
They took away

46:11.560 --> 46:15.281
the Zekes' exponential power.

46:16.960 --> 46:20.442
They pulled the teeth of all 23 million

46:20.880 --> 46:24.123
in less than 24 hours.

46:28.520 --> 46:31.603
The greatest feat
of social engineering in history.

46:32.040 --> 46:33.565
It's brilliant.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.206
No teeth,

46:36.240 --> 46:37.571
no bite.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.764
No great spread.

46:43.800 --> 46:44.881
Bullshit.

46:45.080 --> 46:48.527
More books,
fewer receptions, Boutros Boutros.

46:48.920 --> 46:50.888
Now, why do you have to burn them

46:50.960 --> 46:52.724
to ashes to get them to finally stop?

46:52.800 --> 46:54.404
Why do they move like a plague?

46:54.480 --> 46:56.209
Why is Israel winning?

46:57.280 --> 46:58.850
How is Israel winning?

46:59.640 --> 47:01.927
They sealed off their entire country

47:02.600 --> 47:05.570
days before the undead attacked man.

47:06.040 --> 47:07.371
First to know,

47:07.920 --> 47:09.365
first to act.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.881
People have been
building walls there for two millennia.

47:11.920 --> 47:14.605
Mmm. Right. Yeah, but,

47:14.680 --> 47:16.364
finish all those

47:16.440 --> 47:19.091
thousands of years of work a week ago?

47:20.000 --> 47:21.490
Impeccable timing is all.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.764
You want answers?

47:28.720 --> 47:30.449
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

47:31.480 --> 47:35.485
That's the man
in Jerusalem you want to see.

47:36.800 --> 47:38.006
You ever seen anything like that?

47:38.120 --> 47:39.281
Hell, no.

47:39.360 --> 47:42.682
We're going to Jerusalem.
I'm your co-pilot.

47:49.320 --> 47:50.446
Oh, hang on.

47:50.680 --> 47:52.284
Hang on. Hang on a minute.

47:53.320 --> 47:54.606
- Hello?

47:56.160 --> 47:57.366
Gerry?

47:58.280 --> 48:00.203
- Honey?
<i>- Gerry, can you hear me?</i>

48:00.280 --> 48:01.327
Karin?

48:02.080 --> 48:03.320
Hello?

48:06.480 --> 48:08.130
- God damn it!

48:17.840 --> 48:19.524
Give me your hand.

48:22.520 --> 48:23.567
No way. No.

48:23.640 --> 48:24.926
My mother. Dallas.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.571
Probably pacing a hole in the floor
right now if she's still there.

48:27.640 --> 48:30.211
Better chance of you seeing
her before me, that's all.

48:30.280 --> 48:32.760
It's a big plane. We got a lot of room.

48:32.840 --> 48:35.844
Better the devil you know
than the one you don't.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.965
You'll be all right.
Just pedal your ass off.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.242
Make sure Maverick here keeps
the nose of that plane

48:41.320 --> 48:42.446
pointed towards the sun.

48:42.520 --> 48:45.763
Just remember, don't lock
the bowser's fuel line to the inlet.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.365
Tell me 10 more times.

48:47.440 --> 48:48.885
- You good?
- Right here.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.008
All right. Don't rush.

48:51.720 --> 48:54.405
We've got one chance
to fuel their plane, so let's do it right.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.642
If you ain't a crack shot,
don't aim for the head,

48:56.720 --> 48:57.767
just get Zeke on the ground.

48:57.840 --> 49:01.003
Remember, "Spine's divine,
those knees they work just fine!"

49:01.080 --> 49:02.844
Let's go, lights out!

49:23.240 --> 49:25.527
<i>Alpha in position.</i>

49:25.600 --> 49:27.648
<i>Bravo moving out.</i>

49:27.720 --> 49:30.121
<i>Remember, these things
are drawn to sound.</i>

49:30.200 --> 49:33.329
<i>So I need you close to target
before I bring you the truck.</i>

49:33.400 --> 49:36.085
<i>Now there's only one way
we're getting you on that plane,</i>

49:36.200 --> 49:38.248
<i>and that's quietly.</i>

50:07.840 --> 50:08.887
- Shit!

50:08.960 --> 50:10.769
God damn it!
Shut that thing off!

50:15.360 --> 50:16.725
<i>Looks like we just woke the dead.</i>

50:17.920 --> 50:19.001
<i>Out of respect for others,</i>

50:19.120 --> 50:20.804
<i>please turn off all pagers
and cell phones.</i>

50:23.920 --> 50:25.490
We got to move.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.123
We've got to get out of here, let's move!

50:34.640 --> 50:35.880
Go, go, go!

50:41.800 --> 50:43.006
Whoo!

50:45.840 --> 50:47.080
I'm gonna clear a path through Zeke!

50:47.160 --> 50:48.650
You pedal like hell!

50:51.160 --> 50:53.640
<i>Come on, boys,
I need head shots! Tap 'em out!</i>

50:53.720 --> 50:55.449
<i>I want to see some Zeke on the ground!</i>

51:33.400 --> 51:36.051
You're kidding me.
I'm a God damn Zeke.

51:37.400 --> 51:39.846
<i>I got you, Captain. Just say the word.</i>

51:40.560 --> 51:43.370
<i>It's all right, boys.
I got this one.</i>

51:45.720 --> 51:47.370
- God damn it.
- We got enough!

51:47.920 --> 51:49.843
We need to detach the fuel line!

51:51.560 --> 51:53.562
Israel better pay off.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.329
All right, I have instrument,
but only on single prop.

52:05.400 --> 52:06.761
You'll have to talk me through it.

52:09.720 --> 52:10.960
Okay, we're clear.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.485
Okay. Give me all the lights.

52:15.200 --> 52:16.850
Switch on the anti-icing.

52:16.920 --> 52:17.921
- Where?
- The red knob.

52:18.040 --> 52:20.441
- Got it, got it.
- Set up our heading 020 for departure.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.241
- We got to move!
- Set flaps 15 degrees.

52:23.400 --> 52:24.731
Flaps 15.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.247
All right, we are all set.
Let's get out of here!

52:29.760 --> 52:31.125
Make it steep.

52:51.240 --> 52:52.605
- Gerry?
<i>- Hi, baby.</i>

52:52.680 --> 52:53.761
Hi. Hi.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.483
<i>I tried to call you.</i>

52:58.320 --> 53:00.129
I know, I was...

53:00.680 --> 53:02.887
It was bad timing, I was running around.

53:03.440 --> 53:04.930
Are you okay?

53:09.400 --> 53:11.880
<i>Yeah, every/thing's okay. I'm okay.</i>

53:13.560 --> 53:15.085
That's the spirit.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.726
Yeah.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.646
Listen,

53:19.000 --> 53:20.650
Korea didn't work out.

53:23.800 --> 53:26.326
<i>Now it looks like
we're gonna have to go to Israel.</i>

53:26.400 --> 53:28.528
Try to get some rest on the flight.

53:29.360 --> 53:30.964
How are the kids?

53:31.600 --> 53:32.601
Um...

53:34.480 --> 53:35.811
I think...

53:37.480 --> 53:39.960
<i>They're really... They're good.</i>

53:41.120 --> 53:42.963
<i>I got Connie right here.</i>

53:54.000 --> 53:55.161
Baby?

54:12.160 --> 54:14.766
<i>Attention,
unidentified aircraft.</i>

54:14.840 --> 54:18.083
<i>You are in a restricted airspace
and not clear for landing.</i>

54:18.520 --> 54:20.682
Jerusalem tower, Reach 394.

54:20.920 --> 54:22.888
<i>Pan, pan, pan.
Request immediate landing.</i>

54:22.960 --> 54:25.486
<i>Contact Mossad,
office of Jurgen Warmbrunn.</i>

54:25.560 --> 54:27.210
<i>Special Envoy, United Nations.</i>

54:37.360 --> 54:41.081
Stay with the plane. Be ready to bug out.
I'll be back before dark.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.051
<i>The problem
with most people is that</i>

55:38.120 --> 55:39.804
<i>they don't believe
something can happen</i>

55:40.080 --> 55:41.923
until it already has.

55:42.160 --> 55:44.083
It's not stupidity or weakness.

55:45.320 --> 55:47.004
It's just human nature.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.365
How did you know?

55:51.600 --> 55:53.125
Gerald Lane.

55:53.680 --> 55:56.160
Wrote a self-defeating Jeremiad

55:56.240 --> 55:59.403
about his employer,
the U.N., back in 2010.

56:00.280 --> 56:03.250
Caused a few ripples.
Sidelined your career.

56:04.240 --> 56:07.050
Thought you'd have parlayed
those ripples into a self-righteous book.

56:07.120 --> 56:08.804
No nose for profit.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.043
How did Israel know?

56:11.840 --> 56:14.969
We intercepted a communique
from an Indian general

56:15.360 --> 56:17.886
saying they were
fighting the <i>Rakshasha.</i>

56:17.960 --> 56:20.566
Translation, zombies.

56:20.960 --> 56:23.201
Technically undead.

56:25.960 --> 56:27.405
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

56:27.480 --> 56:29.881
High-ranking official in the Mossad.

56:30.240 --> 56:34.962
Described as sober, efficient,
not terribly imaginative.

56:35.480 --> 56:38.609
And yet you build a wall
because you read a communique

56:38.680 --> 56:40.842
that mentions the word "zombie"?

56:42.040 --> 56:45.681
Well, when put like that,
I'd be skeptical as well.

56:46.520 --> 56:48.568
In the '30s, Jews refused to believe

56:48.640 --> 56:51.166
they could be sent
to concentration camps.

56:51.440 --> 56:55.684
In '72, we refused to fathom
we'd be massacred in the Olympics.

56:56.160 --> 57:00.290
In the month before October 1973,
we saw Arab troop movements,

57:00.360 --> 57:03.125
and we unanimously agreed
they didn't pose a threat.

57:03.920 --> 57:08.323
Well, a month later, the Arab attack
almost drove us into the sea.

57:08.960 --> 57:11.361
So we decided to make a change.

57:12.400 --> 57:13.640
A change?

57:14.120 --> 57:15.485
The Tenth Man.

57:16.840 --> 57:18.808
If nine of us
look at the same information

57:18.880 --> 57:21.451
and arrive at the exact same conclusion,

57:21.520 --> 57:24.205
it's the duty of the tenth man
to disagree.

57:24.640 --> 57:27.086
No matter how improbable it may seem,

57:27.160 --> 57:29.208
the tenth man has to start digging

57:29.280 --> 57:31.567
on the assumption
that the other nine are wrong.

57:33.720 --> 57:35.210
And you were that tenth man.

57:36.120 --> 57:37.167
Precisely.

57:43.560 --> 57:47.929
Since everyone assumed that this talk of
zombies was cover for something else,

57:48.000 --> 57:51.083
I began my investigation
on the assumption

57:51.160 --> 57:55.404
that when they said "zombies,"
they meant zombies.

57:56.560 --> 57:58.130
Was patient zero from India?

57:58.400 --> 57:59.686
That's the problem.

57:59.760 --> 58:01.361
There's so many
potential sources in play

58:01.400 --> 58:03.209
that no one knows where it began.

58:04.160 --> 58:06.083
The organ trade in Germany.

58:06.560 --> 58:10.281
Strange examples of violent behavior
across the Asian peninsulas.

58:11.240 --> 58:14.926
Meanwhile, the zombie plague keeps
spreading, and we do what we can.

58:16.840 --> 58:19.081
These are
the Jerusalem Salvation Gates.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.685
Two of 10 portals

58:21.760 --> 58:24.570
through the security perimeter
into fortified Israel.

58:29.120 --> 58:30.929
You're letting people in.

58:31.360 --> 58:34.443
Every human being we save
is one less zombie to fight.

59:16.640 --> 59:17.971
It's okay.

59:44.840 --> 59:48.526
If I could get into India, where
would I start? Who would I speak with?

59:48.600 --> 59:50.523
India's a black hole.

59:50.600 --> 59:52.602
Forget about patient zero.

59:52.680 --> 59:55.206
I can't do that.
It's too late for me to build a wall.

59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.928
I'm running out of time. I need specifics.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.162
- I need answers...
- I don't have answers.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.368
All you can do is find a way to hide.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.210
Get troops down there.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.765
It's too loud! It's too loud!

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.690
They're coming over the top!

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.888
- Shit!

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.003
<i>Command, we have a breach
at Salvation Gate.</i>

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.650
<i>They're coming over the wall!</i>

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.285
Get him to Jaffa Gate.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.961
She'll get you out of here,
she'll get you to your plane!

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.610
Stay low!

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.250
Wrong way! Wrong way!

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.683
Go to landing point B.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.886
Roger, we are inbound
to landing point B.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.722
Hawk 5, almost there.
E.T.A. one minute.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.646
<i>Hawk 5. Hawk 5,
you're patched in. Over.</i>

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.802
<i>This is Hawk 5. Listen carefully.</i>

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.608
<i>The city is breached,
and they're heading towards the airport.</i>

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.160
- One thousand one.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.571
One thousand two.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.927
One thousand three. One thousand four.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.011
- One thousand five.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.166
One thousand six.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.245
One thousand seven.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.931
One thousand eight.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.166
We got to move.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.446
You'll be all right.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.407
You're not gonna turn.
You're not gonna turn!

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.291
We got to move.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.204
- We got to move!

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.285
<i>5 going down.</i>

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.760
<i>Chopper 5 is down.</i>

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.370
<i>I say again, chopper 5 is down.</i>

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.249
<i>L.Z. is overrun.</i>

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.851
Tower, Reach 394.
Requesting immediate departure.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.240
<i>Tower to 394.
Proceed to runway four.</i>

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.566
<i>Good luck out there.</i>

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.926
No!

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.169
There! That one!

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.765
Stop. Stop.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:25.560
Go! Go!

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.045
Get them out of here!

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.764
Stay calm, please.
Stay calm.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.808
Come on. Go, go, go.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.801
What's your destination?

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.928
I don't know. We were headed here,
but I don't know.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.209
I'm Gerry, by the way.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.561
Segen.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.686
Segen.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.920
First or last?

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.411
Just Segen.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.801
So, what we're doing,

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.644
we've got to change this bandage
and we're gonna clean it.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.846
Okay?

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.963
You okay? Okay?

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.361
Okay.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.329
Come on, gut up. Gut up.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.131
Here we go.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.241
We're almost there.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.402
Okay. Big breaths.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.486
Let's get this over fast. Big breaths.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.561
Here we go.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.088
Come on. Good.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.083
Last step. Last step.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.807
Big breath.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.809
Good job. There it is. Okay.
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.731
Okay. Okay, I think you've earned this.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.850
Very good. Okay.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.365
You a doctor?

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.921
No.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.964
I've had some training in the field.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.042
How did you know?

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.281
Cutting it off...
How did you know it would work?

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.005
I didn't.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.446
Now I'm just a liability.

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.645
<i>This prick</i>

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.087
stands right in the mix,

01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.366
while seven or eight of them

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.647
<i>turn Zeke all at the same time.</i>

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.609
<i>Is that how
you tweaked your leg?</i>

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.682
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.682
<i>Got no time for his lucky ass.</i>

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.531
<i>Now, the hard part
is seeing the crumbs</i>

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.250
<i>for the clues they are.</i>

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.363
And sometimes the thing you thought

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.848
was the most brutal aspect of the virus

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.600
<i>turns out to be the chink in its armor.</i>

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.206
<i>I don't have answers.</i>

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.004
<i>All you can do is find a way to hide.</i>

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.521
Gerry?

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.965
<i>Are you okay? Where are you, baby?
What's happening?</i>

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.121
I love you. I'm sorry.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.401
<i>But you've got to get Thierry now.</i>

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.527
I'll find him.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.608
- Thierry! Thierry.
- Excuse me. Karin.

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:04.080
Gerry needs you. I love you.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.691
Gerry? Where are you?

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.281
On the last flight out.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.408
Listen, my phone is dying
and I need some quick intel.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.562
You gotta locate the closest
medical research facility.

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.450
A C.D.C., a W.H.O.,
something that makes vaccines.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.640
<i>- And the closest airport to it.</i>
- I don't understand.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.446
No time to explain.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.601
<i>Just make it happen, man.</i>

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.841
Okay, okay.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.890
But, Gerry,
I still don't know where you are.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.480
Well, go and find out what he needs.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.645
You're gonna want to take this.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:38.566
Take it.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.931
Your battery is dead.

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.125
We made contact
with Cardiff Airport, Wales.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.362
Your people directed us.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:01.171
There is W.H.O.
research facility nearby,

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.846
but they are not sure
it's still operational.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.126
This is location.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.931
Can we make it?

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:18.088
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain.</i>

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.601
<i>I'm glad to report that
we are on our final approach</i>

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.330
<i>to Cardiff Airport in Wales.</i>

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.131
<i>All European airports
are under lockdown.</i>

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.285
<i>But we have been given
priority status and cleared for landing.</i>

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:32.045
<i>We will be allowed to disembark.</i>

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.327
<i>We are very, very lucky.</i>

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.242
Hey. Who do you belong to?

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.401
What's there?

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.561
- What is it?

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.807
You... Bags.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.889
We need trolley and bags.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.121
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Bravo 160 heavy.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.725
Emergency descent!

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.726
Prepare for impact.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.211
Got to move.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.611
Come on, come on.

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.251
Give me something good.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.721
Sir, Cardiff Airport
lost contact with the plane.

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:13.087
Lane is M.I.A. I'm sorry, sir.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.600
<i>Chopper inbound
for immediate relocation.</i>

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:31.920
<i>I say again.</i>

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.571
<i>All non-essential personnel
given F-6 status</i>

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.211
<i>need to report for immediate relocation.</i>

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.560
Ma'am?

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.849
Thierry would like a word with you.

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.243
Captain, it's only been 48 hours.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.847
He's a resourceful man. There's every
chance he could have survived.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:58.003
Sir, I gave him my word
we would look after his family.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.050
Yes, sir. I understand.

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.568
Okay. Let's go. We're good.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:55.440
<i>Daddy!</i>

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.250
<i>Daddy!</i>

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.681
Daddy!

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.082
You're a tough bastard.

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.491
And a lucky one.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.650
Who are you?

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.603
I came here with a... With a woman.

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.007
Is she still...

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.168
Who are you?
Why have you come here?

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.285
Why do you keep looking at him?

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.762
'Cause he's the one in charge.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.445
You know what this place is?

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.769
Of course I do. That's why I'm here.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.366
Then you understand
how this must look to us.

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.046
This

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.443
is important to you?

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.721
- How long have I been out?
- Three days.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.206
Give me the phone.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.731
Just give me the phone.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.128
Give me the God damn phone!
Give me the phone!

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.043
As soon as you answer my question.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.041
Call it.

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.361
Call the number,
they'll tell you who I am. Call it.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.607
<i>Gerry?</i>

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.247
- Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.
<i>- My God.</i>

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.365
We thought you were dead.

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:33.851
<i>Gerry, where are you?</i>

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.248
Thierry, I'm with
a couple of nervous gentlemen.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.890
<i>They need some bona fides
before I can speak with you.</i>

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.047
Of course.

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:41.290
<i>This is Thierry Umutoni.</i>

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.202
Deputy Secretary-General.
United Nations.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.244
<i>To whom am I speaking?</i>

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.641
Where's Karin?

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.842
Thierry, why didn't Karin answer?

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.241
I'm sorry, Gerry.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.011
<i>I did what I could.</i>

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.766
What does that mean?

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.569
You've got to calm down.
No, stop! Stop.

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.290
You're going to hurt yourself.

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.121
You're okay.

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.564
His family has been sent
to a refugee camp in Nova Scotia.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.284
I'm sure they'll be safe.

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:38.485
Are you? Thierry told you
who I am and what I used to do, right?

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.641
Yeah.

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.961
Then trust me when
I tell you they're not safe.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.091
I understand how you feel.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.885
- Do you? Yes?
- Yes.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.810
Do you have a family?

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.245
- No.
- No.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.331
Then you couldn't possibly understand,
could you?

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.447
I lost my son and wife in Rome.

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.920
Rather, I lost my son to

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:07.484
something that had once been my wife.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:13.161
We have all lost someone, Mr. Lane.

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.408
In your case, there is hope at least.

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.811
I'm sorry.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:20.806
I'm sorry.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.211
Now,

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.009
why did you come here?

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.082
What do you need from us?

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.484
Your worst disease.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.091
He wants a what?

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.690
Deadly pathogen.

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.964
With a high mortality rate.

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.126
- But curable.
- Okay, well...

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.567
You'd want a bacteria
rather than a virus,

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.926
I would think. Typhus?

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.205
Meningitis. Scarlet Fever.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.560
Rocky Mountain Fever.

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:53.361
Anyway, excuse me, what's this for?

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:57.486
Mr. Lane believes we can use
such a disease against the undead.

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:01.202
I would give you points
for originality, Mr. Lane,

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:03.203
if we hadn't already
tried that, first thing.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:09.043
One of the many things a virus or
bacteria needs to thrive is a live host.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.605
A functioning circulatory system.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:12.848
I'm afraid it boils down
to one simple fact...

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.604
You can't make a dead person sick.

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:17.605
It's not for them.

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.850
It's for us.

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.961
I believe these things have a weakness.

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.603
And that weakness is weakness.

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.770
- Our weakness.

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.241
I have witnessed them
literally bypass people.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.085
Walk right around them like
a river around a rock. Why?

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.207
I think, because those people were sick.

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.091
I think they were terminal.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.571
And these things could sense it.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.002
I think they're spreading a pathogen,

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.809
and they need a healthy host.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.168
But even if you're right, I mean,
infecting the populace

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.447
with a lethal illness
is not exactly a cure.

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:52.400
It's not a cure. It's camouflage.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.365
It's camouflage.

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:03.769
There's a natural precedent.

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:07.487
Hungry predators
will avoid diseased bodies.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.526
Equipped with the right pathogen,
our troops

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.887
would be essentially
invisible to the enemy.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.964
You understand the only way
to prove this theory of yours is

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:18.891
for some idiot to infect themselves

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.849
with a lethal pathogen and then...

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.970
...meet with her, face to face.

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:29.406
Yes.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.162
Do we have what we need to try it?

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.720
We have all he could want.

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.806
Typhus, H1N1, SARS.

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.090
The problem is,

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.208
they're all stored in B-Wing.

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:43.889
What's the matter with B-Wing?

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:48.483
Dr. Spellman.
Our chief vaccinologist.

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.605
Within hours of the outbreak,
he'd been sent blood samples

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.887
to try and isolate the pathogenic cause.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.250
Unfortunately...

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.131
This is B-Wing now.

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.889
God damn it.

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.406
How many?

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.441
How many are there?

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.363
There were 80 people working there.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.849
I've never seen them move like that.

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.206
They're dormant.

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.682
They're awaiting stimulus.

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:36.881
Now, this

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:39.365
is vault 139.

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.729
That's where your samples would be.

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:45.327
This is the skybridge.

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.927
That connects B-Wing
to the main building here.

01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:54.169
And this, is the only thing
standing between us and the skybridge.

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.401
So,

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.043
what do you propose, Mr. Lane?

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.650
You are not serious.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.088
B-Wing's a maze.
They'll never make it back alone.

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.443
We don't even know
if his theory is correct.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.444
Well, I know I'm not asking
one of you to take him there.

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.604
Each has its merits.

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.886
- Last resort.
- It's too loud.

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.241
Let's go.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:42.965
Try not to kill one.

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.082
It only makes
the rest of them more aggressive.

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.281
Yeah.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.885
You sure you want to do this?

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:11.768
Of course I'm not. Let's go.

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:13.641
Good luck.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.650
See you all shortly.

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:22.966
Good luck.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:30.331
If anything comes down this hall before
we do, you seal these doors for good.

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:32.528
Understood?
- Okay.

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.565
There they are.

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:41.481
Go, go.

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:58.406
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:00.001
Come on!

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.883
They're fine. They're fine.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.491
Shit.

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.087
The vault we need is in 139.

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:03.921
Go!

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:09.771
Oh, my God.

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.610
Left, left, left!

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.651
What are you doing?

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.490
She'll get you to the vault.

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.886
That's the vault.

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:42.291
- We can make it.
- No, we can't.

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:46.210
We can't make it. Let's go!

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:12.847
They're not gonna make it.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.524
You heard what Javi said,
we cannot open it.

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:15.965
They're not alone, we can't open it!

01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:17.405
They are coming back!

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:21.283
We can't leave them there.

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:22.846
Come on!

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.090
Open the door!

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.971
- Run!
- Run!

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:33.646
Run! Faster, come on!

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.921
Run!

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:37.610
In, in, in!

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.325
Come on!

01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.963
Now where is Gerry?

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:52.447
Where is he, where is he, where is he?

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:56.087
Come on, come on, where are you?

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.484
<i>5-6-9-6-4.</i>

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.127
5-6-9-6-4.

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:45.605
What happened to Gerry?

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:02.080
Not that one. Not that one.

01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.566
Oh, shit!

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:33.721
Shit!

01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:57.361
Jesus.

01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.804
He's going to inject himself.

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.042
We have no idea
which one's going to work.

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:10.487
We don't know if any of them will work.

01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:13.526
If he uses anything
he took from that left case,

01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:15.850
he's dead anyway.

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:43.045
What's he doing?

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.883
How long does he have to wait?

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:38.886
Before he's infected? Not long, but,

01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:41.611
that's not the question
we're really asking, is it?

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:33.931
Look at them.

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.684
He just walked right past him!

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:03.931
He walked right past him!

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.085
- Like it was nobody!

01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:17.801
Okay.

01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.570
<i>This isn't the end.</i>

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:18.646
<i>Not even close.</i>

01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:20.927
<i>Hi, there. This is...</i>

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.604
<i>This is Amy. Is anyone out there?</i>

01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:24.560
<i>Hello. I'm trying
to get in contact with anyone.</i>

01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:26.682
<i>We've had some luck
finding people with this transmission.</i>

01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:28.364
<i>We've lost entire cities.</i>

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:30.761
<i>When there's
no more people left to infect,</i>

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:33.002
<i>they go dormant. Whole cities are lost.</i>

01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:34.600
<i>The World Health Organization</i>

01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:36.529
<i>reports today that help may soon...</i>

01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:38.602
<i>...a hybridized
meningitis strain</i>

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:41.001
<i>with components of smallpox and H1N1.</i>

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.764
<i>We still don't
know how it started.</i>

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.490
<i>The World Health
Organization has created</i>

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:47.450
<i>a vaccine that works
as a kind of camouflage,</i>

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:51.002
<i>making people who receive it
invisible to the infected.</i>

01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.526
<i>We bought ourselves some time.</i>

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:55.046
<i>Volunteer forces
are delivering the vaccine</i>

01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:57.122
<i>to areas that have been cordoned off.</i>

01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.965
<i>Distribution efforts
began in earnest on April 10th...</i>

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:01.405
<i>The importance
of getting the information</i>

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:03.648
<i>out to those still alive
within the quarantine...</i>

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:06.284
<i>But it's given us a chance.</i>

01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:24.563
<i>If you
can get to a colder area,</i>

01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:26.608
<i>to higher ground,
they move slower on the ground.</i>

01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:29.650
<i>The Battle
of Moscow is still raging.</i>

01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:32.804
<i>Initial tests
on the so-called camouflage</i>

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.609
<i>have been largely successful.</i>

01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:41.801
<i>Others have found
a way to push back.</i>

01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:46.087
Move, move!
All right, juice 'em up!

01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:57.081
<i>Approaching target.
Permission to engage.</i>

01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:58.771
<i>Permission granted.</i>

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:01.366
<i>All clear.
Light 'em up. Light 'em up.</i>

01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:04.326
<i>It's permanent!</i>

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:07.609
<i>It's settled, it's settled! It's over with!</i>

01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:09.682
<i>There's no forgiveness in hell!</i>

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:13.401
<i>Whatever goes to hell, stays in hell!</i>

01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:15.643
<i>This is Station 7 in Nebraska,</i>

01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:16.886
<i>broadcasting on the shortwave band.</i>

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:19.611
<i>If you can fight, fight.</i>

01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:20.841
<i>Head north if you can.</i>

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:23.890
<i>Hello?
Is there anyone out there hearing this?</i>

01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.246
<i>Help each other.</i>

01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:28.290
<i>Mexico City has been
declared a complete loss.</i>

01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.369
<i>Be prepared for anything.</i>

01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:46.722
<i>Our war has just begun.</i>
