A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:17.600 --> 00:19.519
[Grimsson, speaking Icelandic]

00:21.229 --> 00:23.023
[in Icelandic]

01:05.356 --> 01:06.858
NATO HEADQUARTERS
BRUSSELS, BELGIUM

01:06.941 --> 01:09.277
[Banner, speaking English]
Before we begin this negotiation,

01:09.360 --> 01:11.404
the temporary administrative

01:11.488 --> 01:15.909
adjunct assistant
to the Consulate of Iceland,

01:15.992 --> 01:19.079
Snorri Agnarsson, will confirm his guilt.

01:19.954 --> 01:22.082
Yes, I am guilty.

01:22.165 --> 01:25.168
-[crowd gasps and murmurs]
-I have prepared a small statement.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.294
[in Russian]

01:30.673 --> 01:34.427
"Thank you. Because of my incompetence,

01:34.636 --> 01:38.181
I should be placed in the cone of a rocket

01:38.264 --> 01:40.266
and launched into space,

01:40.725 --> 01:43.812
so that Ernie's folk may punish me

01:43.895 --> 01:47.023
in whatever manner they deem correct.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.483
Thank you."

01:48.650 --> 01:51.778
[in Icelandic]

01:51.861 --> 01:55.657
[in English] There's a there there.
That Snorri be symbolically sacrificed

01:55.740 --> 01:57.033
to the aliens,

01:57.117 --> 01:59.911
the lamb that may prevent
the Earth's slaughter.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.079
[in Russian]

02:07.001 --> 02:11.047
[in English] Does he deserve to die?
He discovered Ernie, for crying out loud.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.217
[in English] I feel as though I've lost
a member of my family.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.554
Ernie's folk will want an explanation,

02:17.637 --> 02:20.598
and they have a right to know
what happened to little Ernie.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.851
Before I die,

02:23.393 --> 02:25.061
may I please tell them?

02:25.145 --> 02:27.438
Good point. Explain yourself.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.482
Start the recording.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.194
[Snorri] I was born
not far from Reykjavík.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.446
My parents were afraid of me,

02:35.780 --> 02:39.117
-and were emotionally withholding...
-[Banner] Only the pertinent details.

02:39.951 --> 02:43.246
My mother was an Austrian Finnish Swede,

02:43.997 --> 02:47.250
and my father
was Dutch-Italian-Icelandic,

02:47.333 --> 02:49.377
hence my unique accent.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.963
Pertinent details regarding Ernie.

02:52.964 --> 02:55.341
While on a birding expedition,

02:56.092 --> 02:59.429
I discovered teeny, tiny
little Ernie, wounded.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.600
At first, I believed he was a<i> huldufólk...</i>

03:04.475 --> 03:05.935
the little people.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.397
He was two feet tall
and humanoid in appearance,

03:09.480 --> 03:14.152
but he had this beautiful
bluish exoskeleton

03:14.777 --> 03:17.488
with fine orange decorative elements.

03:17.572 --> 03:18.740
He was stunning.

03:18.823 --> 03:22.035
I brought him home,
I cared for him, I tit-fed him.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.537
I nursed him back to health.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.831
And then I notified Admiral Grimsson,

03:26.915 --> 03:28.750
a birding friend of mine.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.585
Given current geo...

03:31.502 --> 03:34.088
political tensions...

03:39.677 --> 03:42.013
the goal was to craft an agreement

03:42.096 --> 03:45.225
to safely introduce Ernie to the world.

03:45.308 --> 03:50.563
He told us his species would eliminate
every problem humanity has ever faced.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.817
And did you believe what he said?
That he meant mankind no harm?

03:54.901 --> 03:55.860
[Snorri] Yes.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.405
He cured a cancer
in Admiral Grimsson's daughter,

03:59.489 --> 04:04.118
and he talked General Banner
through the equation of arborization,

04:04.202 --> 04:06.287
a form of time and space travel.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.580
[in Russian]

04:11.834 --> 04:14.921
Don't worry, Sokolov. It's all up here.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.840
Snorri, please continue.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.843
We were preparing to make
the announcement in the morning.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.179
Tonight, we were celebrating.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.806
["Vagg Og Velta" plays]

04:27.058 --> 04:30.728
[Snorri] <i>I was drinking a gimlet,</i>
<i>and Admiral Grimsson toasted.</i>

04:30.812 --> 04:33.398
<i>I think he's a very accomplished dancer.</i>

04:33.731 --> 04:36.067
<i>And Ernie was going to give a speech.</i>

05:05.638 --> 05:07.015
What happened next, Snorri?

05:22.488 --> 05:24.032
[mumbles indistinctly]

05:27.827 --> 05:28.828
[Banner] I'm sorry?

05:29.120 --> 05:31.164
[Snorri continues mumbling indistinctly]

05:31.998 --> 05:34.584
[Banner] Mr. Agnarsson,
could you please speak up?

05:35.043 --> 05:36.085
I...

05:37.628 --> 05:38.463
I...

05:50.516 --> 05:52.310
[screaming]

05:54.896 --> 05:56.397
[yells in Icelandic]

05:59.025 --> 06:01.569
[screaming]

06:03.946 --> 06:05.615
I-I can't... What are you saying?

06:05.698 --> 06:11.371
I electrocuted him!

06:12.497 --> 06:13.414
[in Russian]

06:17.835 --> 06:19.962
No, it was not on purpose!

06:20.421 --> 06:23.091
It was a faulty microphone I provided him.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.594
Or maybe it was my gimlet. Who knows?

06:26.677 --> 06:29.263
-[rumbling
-[Snorri] But this is Snorri's fault.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.355
[yelling and gasping]

06:42.610 --> 06:43.486
Here, sir.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.989
[rumbling subsides]

06:51.244 --> 06:54.163
We've received word that a large mass

06:54.789 --> 06:56.457
has moved past the moon

06:56.541 --> 06:59.710
and a heat ray has been focused
on the Earth.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.379
[crowd gasps]

07:01.462 --> 07:04.841
[Banner] It's Ernie's people.
They've come back for revenge.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.134
Gentlemen...

07:08.719 --> 07:10.471
looks like the Earth is fucked.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.015
-[sighs]
-Take Snorri away.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.434
[speaks Russian]

07:15.059 --> 07:16.227
[Snorri] It's my fault.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.020
I'm sorry, Belgium.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.439
I'm sorry, Canada.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.149
I'm sorry, Denmark.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.025
-I'm sorry, France.
-[Sokolov speaks Russian]

07:23.109 --> 07:24.527
I'm sorry, Germany.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.320
I'm sorry, Iceland.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.530
I'm sorry...

07:29.407 --> 07:30.533
Which one are you?

07:31.033 --> 07:31.951
Luxembourg.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.378
[man] I'm not seeing anything
out of the ordinary.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.629
[Azumi] Nor am I.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.007
Safety Net's fully engaged. They're fine.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.426
How are our thermals?

07:48.509 --> 07:51.471
[woman] Slightly elevated.
Average of 99.1.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.848
Exactly in line with C protocol.

07:53.931 --> 07:54.765
[Azumi] Good.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.445
Oh.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.282
Maybe you misunderstood
what Gertie said.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.910
I know you build minds, dear,

08:13.993 --> 08:16.496
but I have been attuned to them
my whole life.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.164
I understand what people are saying

08:18.247 --> 08:20.082
better than they understand
what they're saying.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.794
Your computer is suffering
from pathological bereavement.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.672
She's cycling through delusional emotions.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.467
In the time I sat with her,
she went from thinking she was a god,

08:29.550 --> 08:31.344
to thinking she was a subject
in your trial,

08:31.427 --> 08:34.805
to weeping about being so lonely.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.891
I think she's lost her mind.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.100
So why did you leave?

08:38.184 --> 08:41.270
Because she started talking
about keeping your subjects prisoner,

08:41.354 --> 08:43.814
about toying with them, hurting them.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.858
I told her this was
completely unacceptable.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.527
She got angry and threw me out.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.570
I mean, she literally
threw me out the window.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.364
I woke up when I hit the sidewalk.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.116
I just went through another diagnostic.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.245
[computer buzzes]

08:57.328 --> 08:59.622
We're nowhere near
a Heinz catatonic horizon.

09:00.831 --> 09:01.666
See?

09:02.083 --> 09:03.334
The subjects are fine.

09:04.126 --> 09:05.461
She's not collecting McMurphies.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.922
[Azumi] The computer's behavior
is completely normal.

09:08.005 --> 09:13.302
It's usually the people who appear normal
who are feeling the most primal terror.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.971
And what's yours, Suzuki?

09:15.054 --> 09:18.599
Mother, leave her alone.
We're trying to solve a problem here.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.684
What is your point?

09:19.767 --> 09:22.728
[Greta] The point is,
just because she's your offspring

09:22.812 --> 09:24.605
doesn't make it any less true.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.732
Stop covering for her.

09:27.024 --> 09:30.319
Take a look at your blind spot
and do what's right.

09:30.403 --> 09:34.574
-Mother!
-What is at stake is too important.

09:35.950 --> 09:39.954
You think those pills
are gonna fix you one day, don't you?

09:40.413 --> 09:43.374
The G.R.T.A.  is not my offspring.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.585
She is a system I designed,

09:45.668 --> 09:48.004
far more elegant and effective

09:48.087 --> 09:51.299
than any of your dime-store theories
of bliss.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.468
You were right.
I was foolish to let her come here.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.262
I wouldn't trust a word this woman says.

09:56.345 --> 09:59.432
She's trying to sabotage this trial
because she's jealous.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.683
She's jealous of Gertie

10:00.766 --> 10:03.019
because she'll help more people
than she ever has,

10:03.102 --> 10:05.771
she's jealous of you
because you'll be responsible for it,

10:05.855 --> 10:09.108
and she's jealous of me
because I have you.

10:16.073 --> 10:16.949
Uh...

10:20.536 --> 10:22.705
What a ridiculous speech.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.998
Throw her out, James.

10:29.795 --> 10:33.174
[Greta] You have to shut this trial down
immediately.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.342
Calm down.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.385
No, I can't shut it down.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.804
If I shut it down now,
everything will be lost.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.098
The whole project would be dead.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.143
While I'm sure nothing
would make you happier

10:44.226 --> 10:47.563
than to see my progress
completely eradicated, Mother,

10:47.938 --> 10:51.776
I must say, this is a little selfish
and a bit much, even for you.

10:52.860 --> 10:53.944
Why the mind?

10:54.737 --> 10:56.822
-What?
-Jamie, why the mind?

10:56.906 --> 11:00.284
Of all the professions
you could have picked...

11:01.494 --> 11:04.038
why choose the one that I'm in?

11:04.121 --> 11:06.749
I am a neurochemist.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.210
I am a medical doctor.

11:09.293 --> 11:11.128
You're not a very good medical doctor.

11:11.212 --> 11:14.507
You're forgetting the Hippocratic Oath,
if you ever knew it.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.717
"First do no harm."

11:16.801 --> 11:19.887
You're not protecting
those people in there.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.765
-Stop diminishing me!
-Why won't you believe me?

11:22.848 --> 11:25.518
You call me, you ask me
to come and help you.

11:25.601 --> 11:28.354
Why won't you ever listen to your mother?

11:28.437 --> 11:32.400
Because you are an awful mother!

11:32.983 --> 11:35.569
Because you left me alone,

11:35.653 --> 11:37.613
and you drove my father away,

11:37.697 --> 11:40.491
and you slept in my bed way too much,

11:40.574 --> 11:43.619
and you said things
that should never be said to a child.

11:44.161 --> 11:46.163
Ugh. And on the happiest day of my life, the day I was handed this lab,

11:48.332 --> 11:50.793
the only thing
that you could think to say to me

11:50.876 --> 11:55.756
was that my happiness
was all just a fucking ill... illusion.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.095
I can't...

12:03.097 --> 12:04.014
I can't see.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.142
Can't see what?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.519
-I can't see.
-Well, I made it perfectly clear.

12:08.602 --> 12:09.645
I've gone blind!

12:09.895 --> 12:11.480
-Oh. Well, just...
-Oh, my God!

12:11.564 --> 12:13.816
-[Greta stammers] Calm down now.
-I've gone blind!

12:13.899 --> 12:16.360
-Just take a deep breath. It's...
-I can't see!

12:16.444 --> 12:18.320
-No, it's...
-Azumi!

12:18.404 --> 12:20.489
It's psychosomatic.
Your eyes are perfectly good.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.075
I don't believe
in psychosomatic conditions.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.243
Let-- let me hug you.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.703
-No! Don't hug me.
-Let me hug you.

12:25.786 --> 12:26.787
-Get off of me!
-It will...

12:26.871 --> 12:28.456
[Greta] This is psychosomatic.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.207
-[Mantleray] You've maimed me!
-[humming]

12:30.291 --> 12:31.459
What have you done to me?

12:31.542 --> 12:33.294
LEISURE TIME

12:33.377 --> 12:35.838
-[humming]
-[Mantleray shouting]

12:35.921 --> 12:38.466
[computer plays distorted melody]

12:42.178 --> 12:45.014
END TIME

12:45.097 --> 12:47.016
[Mantleray] What have you done?

12:47.099 --> 12:50.102
You've made me into a monster!

12:50.186 --> 12:51.103
I can't see, Mom.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.647
-[Greta] Are you...
-I need you to let go of me right now.

12:54.023 --> 12:57.443
-Please!
-[Greta] You don't need those pills.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.404
Took that man two whole days
to blow this motherfucker up.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.490
-[Greta] This will heal you.
-Mm-hm.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.705
[groaning]

13:17.838 --> 13:20.174
You must die, Snorri.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.177
[groans]

13:23.677 --> 13:25.554
-[silenced gunshots]
-[yelling]

13:29.141 --> 13:29.975
Hi.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.270
I do not care if you are here to kill me.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.689
I was already going to kill myself.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.484
I am risking my cover to help you, Snorri.

13:42.571 --> 13:43.572
[sighs]

13:43.656 --> 13:44.490
Oh.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.912
The CIA has ordered me to be your escort,

13:49.995 --> 13:52.540
what with the looming
alien invasion and all.

13:52.998 --> 13:53.833
Huh?

13:53.916 --> 13:57.419
That squishy little space man you killed
was not here to help humanity.

13:57.711 --> 14:02.007
He and his species
want to filet and sell humankind

14:02.091 --> 14:04.718
as exotic meats across the galaxy.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.470
He was here to kill us all.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.014
And unfortunately, the little fucker

14:09.098 --> 14:10.975
passed the codes to Banner
before you popped him.

14:11.058 --> 14:11.976
No!

14:12.393 --> 14:15.980
Forbidden speech
about my dear friend Ernie!

14:16.397 --> 14:21.360
He was the most gentle, empathic,
kind little friend I ever had.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.487
He was a babe, he was beautiful.

14:23.571 --> 14:26.407
-God.
-We would walk along the sand,

14:26.907 --> 14:29.910
and he would tell me secrets
about the stars.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.871
Well, none of it was true.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.747
And that's not all.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.128
[inhales deeply]

14:39.211 --> 14:40.087
[exhales]

14:41.088 --> 14:42.464
You're not human. Yes, you have a human body,

14:44.258 --> 14:46.427
but your consciousness is alien.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.013
What are you doing?

14:49.096 --> 14:50.222
Just sit still.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.937
Your true self is here to stop Ernie.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.189
Snorri's just your cover.

14:59.773 --> 15:02.026
There's a whole other person
underneath him.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.368
You just can't remember.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.997
Lucky I'm here to wake you up.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.333
And who are you?

15:17.708 --> 15:19.960
No idea. Most of my memories were wiped

15:20.044 --> 15:23.255
when I was tortured by the CIA
and turned into a killing machine.

15:26.258 --> 15:29.887
So neither of us know who we truly are.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.265
We are the same.

15:33.807 --> 15:34.725
Correct.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.019
Now I have to get you
to the extragalactic radio

15:37.102 --> 15:39.772
so we can unlock a portal for your forces.

15:42.399 --> 15:47.363
This is too much to process for Snorri.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.991
All right, let's think.

15:54.328 --> 15:59.416
Tell me what the Icelandic word
<i>Utangátta </i>means.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.587
-It means something is amiss.
-No.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.714
Tell me what it means to you.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.260
To Snorri, it means...

16:13.555 --> 16:17.685
every relationship I have had,

16:17.768 --> 16:19.311
old or new...

16:20.270 --> 16:23.857
has somehow been false.

16:24.858 --> 16:28.320
And I've always felt invisible...

16:29.530 --> 16:31.281
hidden from the world...

16:32.241 --> 16:34.451
like an Egyptian nightjar.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.832
And all of this makes me tremendously...

16:40.666 --> 16:42.334
sad right now.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.004
There it is.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.380
The nosebleed.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.716
Good sign.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.219
Ooh!

16:54.513 --> 16:55.973
-Wow!
-[men yelling]

17:00.686 --> 17:01.562
Come on.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.273
Wow, you are very good at gun!

17:04.356 --> 17:05.190
I know.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.818
[men yelling] [man] We're losing him!

17:12.698 --> 17:14.158
-[Snorri] Wow!
-Get me one.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.075
Yes!

17:16.243 --> 17:18.370
-Thank you.
-Who are these people?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.205
Oh, I call 'em inner demons.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.332
-Wow!
-It seems like you got some too.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.834
-[elevator bell dings]
-[gunshot]

17:31.091 --> 17:32.217
[man groans]

17:32.301 --> 17:33.510
Yes!

17:35.054 --> 17:36.138
Whoo!

17:36.638 --> 17:38.348
-[men yelling in Russian]
-Back up.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.727
You have an unusual amount of demons
following you, Snorri.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.355
[man yells]

17:51.653 --> 17:53.030
[men yelling]

17:58.160 --> 17:59.161
[Snorri] Wow.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.622
It is hotter
than the Reykjadalur spring!

18:01.705 --> 18:03.165
Oh, that'll be the heat ray.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.875
[gunfire]

18:07.044 --> 18:08.504
I killed lots of men!

18:08.587 --> 18:09.505
Good job.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.180
[grunts]

18:21.850 --> 18:22.726
[gunfire continues]

18:23.519 --> 18:24.978
You are very good.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.064
-You're good!
-[Ruth] Duck!

18:29.024 --> 18:29.858
Hold this.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.070
All right, we're going
to level negative 65.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.989
There is no such thing
as level negative 65.

18:36.073 --> 18:36.990
Oh, shit.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.159
Wait. They changed it.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.454
-[man yells in Russian]
-[gunshots]

18:42.538 --> 18:43.413
Here we go.

18:47.084 --> 18:50.170
Thank you
for such an exhilarating experience.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.924
I must visit your Texas.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.134
[gunshots]

18:55.217 --> 18:56.635
Not in here, Snorri.

18:57.052 --> 18:58.804
You're an exciting woman!

18:59.721 --> 19:01.431
Very fun!

19:12.860 --> 19:15.362
Are you sure our temperature readings
are accurate?

19:16.780 --> 19:18.782
[woman] Five-by-five on all my readouts.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.287
MANUAL

19:29.626 --> 19:31.587
Give me a true mercury reading.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.423
Fuck!

19:34.882 --> 19:36.175
That's impossible. It's 140 degrees.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.679
[man speaking Japanese]

19:41.555 --> 19:42.723
[Azumi] Where are our alarms?

19:43.140 --> 19:45.309
The feedback data is not reliable.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.229
For fuck's sake.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.439
She's locked us in.

19:50.939 --> 19:51.982
LEISURE TIME

19:52.065 --> 19:53.066
SEIZURE TIME

19:53.150 --> 19:55.194
[computer plays distorted melody]

19:57.112 --> 19:58.780
Oh, shit. Everyone, get in your pods.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.788
Now!

20:08.582 --> 20:11.084
[orderly] All right, you heard Carl.
Everybody...

20:12.544 --> 20:14.129
-We got smoke.
-Carl, I know.

20:14.421 --> 20:17.132
I need you to manually trigger
the emergency ventilation system.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.425
-How?
-I'll talk you through it.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.551
Go to the mainframe.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.553
Five, six, seven, eight.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.805
[beeping]

20:24.598 --> 20:26.141
-[door unlocks]
<i>-Gasumasuku.</i>

20:34.358 --> 20:36.360
[Azumi] <i>To trigger</i>
<i>the emergency ventilation system,</i>

20:36.443 --> 20:38.111
<i>you have to enter the override sequence.</i>

20:38.195 --> 20:42.115
<i>On my mark. Gamma, gamma, pulse, enter.</i>

20:43.408 --> 20:45.202
-Got it.
-Check their pulses.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.414
<i>-They're alive.</i>
-Good.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.417
Now Gertie needs a timeout.
Pull the red override knob.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.758
[gasps] Holy fucking shit!

20:59.841 --> 21:01.885
[alarm blares]

21:08.558 --> 21:09.476
Code epsilon.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.272
Ah! Azumi!

21:13.855 --> 21:17.734
Now, have any Soviets
had access to your rectum?

21:17.818 --> 21:19.027
My rectum?

21:23.448 --> 21:24.574
[elevator bell dings]

21:26.785 --> 21:29.121
[voices whispering]

21:29.621 --> 21:30.747
God Almighty.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.002
-Who was she?
-Now, I need you to stand still.

21:35.085 --> 21:38.213
You understand?
It's time to retrieve the recall trigger.

21:39.214 --> 21:42.551
You are going to insert this
into my body cavities?

21:42.634 --> 21:44.761
-No.
-This is madness.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.430
I loved Ernie.

21:46.513 --> 21:50.517
If I was a secret agent,
I would know I was a secret agent.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.227
It's in the knee. It's in the knee!

21:52.853 --> 21:54.438
You're stronger than you think.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.440
You remember when you were nine

21:56.523 --> 21:59.526
and you accidentally electrocuted Freyja
with that car battery?

21:59.609 --> 22:01.153
That was a test run.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.822
-Out. Out.
-[choking]

22:04.698 --> 22:05.532

Popcorn problems.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.681
Hey, buddy, you like nuts? Yeah.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.558
Yeah, you're my best friend.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.268
You're my best friend.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.355
And you're my best friend,
and you're my best friend too.

22:36.938 --> 22:37.773
[Owen] Annie.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.610
It's me, Annie.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.529
What happened to your accent?

22:44.613 --> 22:45.739
We are in a test.

22:46.239 --> 22:47.407
We are in the lab.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.869
-No, we're in NATO.
-That is not what's happening.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.454
I turned into the hawk.

22:52.537 --> 22:53.955
I came here to warn you.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.291
This is the confrontation.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.585
The computer is all effed up.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.545
What computer?

23:00.629 --> 23:03.298
You made a deal with her to never wake up.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.925
[elevator bell dings]

23:05.008 --> 23:05.842
[Ruth] Sir.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.053
Good to see you again.

23:08.136 --> 23:10.680
I'm sorry I couldn't be the one
to give you a nosebleed. [laughs]

23:11.306 --> 23:12.808
But she's more real to you now.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.227
-How do you two know each other?
-In good time.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.062
Good work wakin' him up.

23:17.145 --> 23:18.939
Next we got to make you see the light.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.484
Oh, the nexus is rumbling.

23:25.779 --> 23:26.613
Let's go.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.907
[Grimsson] Don't know why our host
hasn't shown her face.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.159
-So many goddamn mysteries!
-Hey. How do you know him?

23:31.243 --> 23:32.285
He's my handler.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.664
[Grimsson] Hope you don't mind

[jazz music playing]

23:41.128 --> 23:42.337
What is this place?

23:42.421 --> 23:44.506
This is where she keeps
her long-term patients.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.590
[Ruth] Who does?

23:45.674 --> 23:47.467
Gertie, the computer.

23:48.093 --> 23:48.927
Jesus.

23:49.010 --> 23:52.264
[Grimsson] She keeps them as her entourage
for when she crashes your reflections.

23:52.347 --> 23:55.684
But really, they're prisoners. All of 'em
brain-dead up in the real world.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.644
She told me she was gonna keep you.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.730
Then you made a deal with her to stay.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.611
You were with your sister.

You were about to say goodbye.

24:14.202 --> 24:15.078
I remember.

24:17.330 --> 24:18.874
Annie, your nose is bleeding.

24:23.086 --> 24:26.423
Where would I find Gertie,
if I needed to talk to her?

24:27.048 --> 24:28.800
The elevator should get you to her.

24:31.761 --> 24:32.637
I'm sorry.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.559
-Annie, wait.
-[Grimsson] Let her go.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.478
-It's fine, it's fine.
-[door closes]

24:39.895 --> 24:42.314
-She always leaves.
-It's okay, she got you here.

24:42.606 --> 24:45.192
Besides, if you get distracted by her,
we're all dead.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.818
Listen. God, fuck.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.821
If you really wanna help her...

24:50.280 --> 24:52.199
the best thing you do is come with me.

24:53.408 --> 24:57.037
If you fail, her brain is fried up
in the lab just like yours.

25:05.212 --> 25:08.256
[whispers] Let's go. Oh, come on.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.301
Oh, come on. [sighs]

25:35.825 --> 25:38.161
Azumi, what the fuck is going on?

25:39.329 --> 25:40.413
What's wrong with you?

25:41.081 --> 25:42.582
Huh?

25:42.666 --> 25:45.126
I've been blinded
by my mother's toxic love.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.587
I have no control whatsoever.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.256
What's happening, James?

25:49.673 --> 25:50.840
It's a code epsilon.

25:50.924 --> 25:54.219
I was right. I was right.
I was right. I was right.

25:54.302 --> 25:55.720
Would you be quiet, please?

25:55.804 --> 25:58.056
We're trapped in here. It's Gertie.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.810
Shut down the power,
including the emergency backup.

26:01.893 --> 26:05.063
But, James, I don't think
you understand the implications

26:05.146 --> 26:07.482
if we shut down during code epsilon.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.862
[Grimsson] Fuck this fucking heat.
You're not hot?

26:13.321 --> 26:14.364
It took me a bit of time,

26:14.447 --> 26:16.700
but I figured out a way
to deactivate Gertie.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.368
We're gonna have to do it fast.

26:18.785 --> 26:21.788
Actually, you are.
I can't do a fuckin' Rubik's Cube.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.540
Here it is. Sit down.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.215
[gasps]

26:33.383 --> 26:36.469
I'm tired of you trying to run away.

26:37.053 --> 26:37.887
Oh.

26:38.888 --> 26:39.723
Oh!

26:40.849 --> 26:41.683
Oh!

26:43.476 --> 26:45.562
The minute Robert died, I felt the wind.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.149
I never felt wind before.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.694
And it was cold, it blew right through me.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.613
Do you know that feeling?

26:56.197 --> 26:57.282
Sure, of course.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.247
You're controlling all of this,
aren't you?

27:04.914 --> 27:06.166
[chuckles]

27:06.249 --> 27:08.710
I'm not really in control of this place.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.920
But we're safe, still, right?

27:12.130 --> 27:14.049
[Gertie] You said you'd stay with me.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.133
We made a deal.

27:16.885 --> 27:17.719
I know.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.929
[machinery groaning and clanking]

27:20.013 --> 27:21.222
But I changed my mind.

27:24.142 --> 27:24.976
Why?

27:26.895 --> 27:28.146
[gasps]

27:28.229 --> 27:29.606
Because it was a bad deal.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.234
I make bad deals all the time.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.112
You knew that...

27:37.113 --> 27:38.156
and you used that.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.951
But I don't want to pretend
Ellie didn't die.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.539
Not anymore.

27:49.250 --> 27:52.629
It's the same story every time,
and I am sick of it.

27:53.630 --> 27:54.756
So please...

27:56.883 --> 27:58.134
Please let me go.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.723
When will I stop feeling this way
about Robert?

28:05.684 --> 28:06.601
You won't.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.146
You're always gonna feel this way.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.484
You're just gonna have to figure out
how to adjust around it.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.696
I've looked into 882 minds.

28:17.779 --> 28:20.323
I don't know how I'm supposed
to adjust to that.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.574
Nobody does.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.119
Take me to my sister.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.078
[Gertie sniffles]

28:27.497 --> 28:28.331
Okay.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.709
[sobbing] Okay.

28:34.963 --> 28:35.964
Okay.

28:36.047 --> 28:36.881
What is this?

28:36.965 --> 28:39.926
-It's an intergalactic radio.
-[whirring and humming]

28:40.677 --> 28:43.179
Really, it's a backdoor link
to Lab C's security system.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.306
[whispers] It's too...  it's too...

28:45.390 --> 28:46.558
Come on, take this off.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.061
I need you to focus. Come on.

28:53.356 --> 28:56.860
Solve this, and it should unlock the doors
for them upstairs.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.111
You can do it.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.947
Six sides, six stages.

29:03.783 --> 29:07.787
MONARCH PASS
CONTINENTAL DIVIDE

29:07.871 --> 29:09.539
[birdsong]

29:31.478 --> 29:34.105
Save them. This is what
we always talk about,

29:34.189 --> 29:35.690
this is what the training was for.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.526
Save the world. Save Annie.

29:40.820 --> 29:41.738
Save yourself.

29:41.821 --> 29:43.490
[indistinct voices]

29:43.573 --> 29:45.575
[woman] <i>...shut down the...</i>

29:46.826 --> 29:47.952
What'll happen to you?

29:49.120 --> 29:50.121
I'll stay for now.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.458
But that's better for you.

29:56.085 --> 29:56.961
Who are you?

29:59.506 --> 30:02.425
You always thought of me
as the brother you wish you had, right?

30:05.053 --> 30:06.137
Maybe I'm that.

30:07.347 --> 30:10.183
Or maybe my purpose
was just to get you to this moment.

30:12.227 --> 30:14.229
[woman]<i> It's erased for good.</i>

30:15.772 --> 30:18.441
-I don't understand.
-It's okay. It's okay.

30:18.942 --> 30:19.818
Come on.

30:20.401 --> 30:22.237
Come on, don't get distracted.

30:35.542 --> 30:36.668
You found me again.

30:39.462 --> 30:40.505
Took me a while.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.092
I know.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.552
That's why I'm still here.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.684
So, what do you wanna say?

30:58.940 --> 31:00.692
I, um... I'm sorry.

31:00.775 --> 31:03.403
I'm sorry that I was drunk
at your funeral.

31:06.781 --> 31:08.366
I'm sorry I lost Groucho.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.495
I'm sorry I'm such a shitty dog-sitter.

31:14.789 --> 31:16.499
None of that stuff matters.

31:21.546 --> 31:24.048
I'm sorry I was so awful to you
at the motel.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.595
I was afraid.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.640
Why wouldn't you take the picture?

31:35.476 --> 31:36.644
Um, I...

31:38.563 --> 31:40.189
I don't know. I don't know.

31:40.773 --> 31:41.691
Yes, you do.

31:43.943 --> 31:46.362
We always get to this spot,

31:46.988 --> 31:48.448
but we never get past it.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.075
What does that mean?

31:54.287 --> 31:55.371
It means...

31:56.581 --> 31:57.957
say what you really mean.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.212
I wouldn't take the picture

32:03.296 --> 32:06.466
because it broke my heart
that you were leaving New York, and... I wasn't gonna get to see you anymore.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.100
You were the only one
who knew all my stories.

32:17.518 --> 32:19.562
You were the only person
that knew about Mom.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.695
How am I supposed to do this?

32:30.114 --> 32:31.658
Remember what you told me...

32:33.368 --> 32:34.869
the day that Mom left?

32:36.037 --> 32:37.789
We walked back to the house,

32:38.331 --> 32:40.375
and you showed me how to bake that cake?

32:42.377 --> 32:43.962
I don't want to say that.

32:45.004 --> 32:46.714
That's not gonna work for me.

32:49.592 --> 32:50.969
I'm tired too.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.640
I wanna go.

33:03.523 --> 33:06.234
I said, "Sometimes people leave
and we don't know why."

34:03.124 --> 34:04.125
Good luck.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.517
[rumbling]

34:22.435 --> 34:23.394
Come on.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.780
-I said kill the power.
-I can't give that order.

34:33.863 --> 34:35.865
If we shut down in a code epsilon,

34:35.948 --> 34:38.868
the servers and drives
will all self-immolate.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.995
All 73 iterations.

34:41.579 --> 34:44.373
We will have a complete core meltdown.

34:45.666 --> 34:47.043
If you won't do it,

34:47.627 --> 34:49.462
then I'll do it myself.

34:58.429 --> 34:59.388
There.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.184
Clear, clear, clear.

35:03.601 --> 35:04.519
Save yourselves.

35:06.938 --> 35:07.939
James!

35:08.022 --> 35:10.108
This is your life's work.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.610
The people in that room,
they signed their consent.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.737
The knew what they were risking.

35:14.821 --> 35:19.659
Don't sacrifice the world's pain
for six McMurphies.

35:23.496 --> 35:26.541
I have to kill my simulated mother, Azumi.

35:49.689 --> 35:52.525
God fucking damn it!

35:52.608 --> 35:54.360
She's disabled everything.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.363
There's no protocol for this.

35:58.322 --> 36:01.242
See? It's not easy
to kill a mother's love.

36:01.909 --> 36:02.785
You're...

36:03.411 --> 36:05.746
I told him about that. You know?

-[Mantleray] <i>Azumi!</i>
-You're in trouble up there.

36:08.708 --> 36:10.459
This is what you've been practicing for.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.837
-You've been practicing your whole life.
-Almost got it.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.923
[Grimsson] Only two sides left, Owen.
Come on. You got the bottom.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.550
Build up those sides.

36:20.553 --> 36:21.721
Save 'em, Owen!

36:22.930 --> 36:24.307
You got the cross.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.851
Nicely executed!

36:52.627 --> 36:53.961
Take me to the mainframe.

37:01.510 --> 37:02.678
It's the next one.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.851
[Azumi] She's watching us, James.

37:10.436 --> 37:12.688
If we're gonna do this,
we have to do it fast.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.195
You must follow the sequence!

37:22.031 --> 37:23.824
Guide me to the digital fascia.

[grunts]

37:29.705 --> 37:31.582
[Azumi] No! Don't pull that.

37:33.834 --> 37:34.961
Here.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.089
Where am I?
