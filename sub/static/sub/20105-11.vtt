00:01.127 --> 00:02.462
<i>Previously on</i> iZombie...

00:03.004 --> 00:04.422
<i>Look, what I found in my hate mail.</i>

00:04.631 --> 00:07.467
"If you ever need
a sympathetic ear,
I've got two. Shawna."

00:07.676 --> 00:09.886
<i>- You're prosecuting Weckler?
- The dominatrix killer.</i>

00:10.095 --> 00:12.138
He confessed even though
you didn't have
much hard evidence.

00:12.347 --> 00:13.473
We need to find
that memory card

00:13.682 --> 00:15.016
Weckler stole from
Roxanne's dungeon.

00:15.225 --> 00:17.686
James Weckler hanged himself
in his cell this morning.

00:17.894 --> 00:18.812
<i>His brain is marinating</i>

00:19.020 --> 00:20.397
<i>in Ravi's blue juice
down at the morgue.</i>

00:21.940 --> 00:23.566
In my vision,
I was getting hanged.

00:23.775 --> 00:25.860
So Weckler
didn't commit suicide.
He was murdered.

00:26.069 --> 00:29.906
I landed us an invite to
the zombie truthers
meeting tomorrow night.

00:30.115 --> 00:31.324
We're gonna capture a zombie.

00:31.533 --> 00:33.535
Let the whole world see
the monster it becomes!

00:34.285 --> 00:35.912
They're starving Don E.
until he turns Romero

00:36.121 --> 00:37.330
and broadcasting it
on a live stream.

00:37.539 --> 00:39.833
You wanna go kick some ass?

00:40.041 --> 00:42.168
- Don't do this!
- No! Please, Ravi!

00:42.377 --> 00:43.962
- Three...
- Don't do this!

00:44.170 --> 00:44.879
Two...

00:47.716 --> 00:49.551
- Don't do it!
- Two...

00:49.759 --> 00:51.594
Do it!

00:51.803 --> 00:53.054
- Do it!
- Shoot him!

00:54.764 --> 00:56.307
- Come on, now!
- Shoot him, bro.

00:56.516 --> 00:57.809
Do it.

00:58.018 --> 00:59.185
All right. All right!

00:59.352 --> 01:00.979
- Let's everybody
keep our cool.
- Shoot him!

01:02.981 --> 01:05.942
You really think
these things feel pain, hmm?

01:06.151 --> 01:07.569
Have honest-to-God
human emotions?

01:08.695 --> 01:10.613
I do. I do.

01:10.822 --> 01:11.823
Yeah?

01:12.615 --> 01:14.367
I think that one
might already be dead.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.292
They're killing machines,
you dumb sumbitch!

01:22.500 --> 01:24.669
Those things
killed our brother.

01:25.336 --> 01:26.337
They'll kill us all!

01:27.922 --> 01:28.590
Do it.

01:34.304 --> 01:36.014
- Don't!
- Let's go!

01:36.222 --> 01:39.017
Here we go, y'all!
Enjoy the show!

01:39.225 --> 01:41.352
There's 100,000 people
seeing this live.

01:41.561 --> 01:42.979
Right now!

01:46.816 --> 01:48.401
You didn't order
a pizza again, did you?

01:49.360 --> 01:50.111
Uh-uh.

01:50.570 --> 01:51.488
Go check it out.

01:52.030 --> 01:53.031
- What?
- Go!

01:55.283 --> 01:56.493
Hit him again, bro.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.254
What the hell?

02:58.012 --> 02:59.889
I got something for you, boy.

03:00.098 --> 03:01.474
One in the head.

03:11.860 --> 03:13.778
Put your weapons
down and your hands up!

03:13.987 --> 03:15.238
This is your only warning!

03:41.347 --> 03:43.057
Liv! Hey...

03:44.642 --> 03:45.852
What happened?

03:46.352 --> 03:48.605
- Are you okay?
- Am I hit?

03:48.813 --> 03:49.731
Uh-huh.

03:50.732 --> 03:52.483
Hey, my rage wore off.

03:52.692 --> 03:55.403
I need you to zap me
so I can tear down this gate.

03:55.612 --> 03:58.740
- With pleasure.
- Uh, Liv, please...

03:59.741 --> 04:00.533
Can I?

04:00.742 --> 04:02.911
Down! Down! Down!

04:03.119 --> 04:03.870
Get down!

04:08.541 --> 04:10.293
Liv?

04:10.835 --> 04:12.503
It's been a helluva day.

04:12.712 --> 04:15.298
You might tell your friends
to quit pointing those guns
at me?

04:42.700 --> 04:44.077
I wanted
to take them alive.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.788
They wanted to go out like
Butch and Sundance.

04:48.414 --> 04:49.999
Who're you?

04:50.208 --> 04:52.293
I'm the guy who just rescued
a zombie from being tortured

04:52.502 --> 04:53.628
live on the Internet.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.047
Along with my
partner in crime here.

04:56.965 --> 04:59.300
Blaine McDonough,
owner, proprietor of
The Scratching Post.

05:00.802 --> 05:01.928
Chase Graves.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.054
I've met a few of
your employees,

05:03.263 --> 05:04.305
but we haven't
had the pleasure.

05:05.223 --> 05:06.391
How'd you find this place?

05:06.599 --> 05:08.059
One of our people
saw the live stream.

05:08.268 --> 05:10.603
We took an educated guess that
Harley Johns was behind it.

05:11.729 --> 05:14.524
The tracker we planted
in his truck led us here.
Where is he?

05:14.732 --> 05:16.901
- Well, he escaped.
- How'd that happen?

05:17.110 --> 05:18.820
Said the person
who showed up late.

05:19.404 --> 05:21.447
Hey, listen. I've got a
business proposition for you.

05:21.656 --> 05:22.907
Why don't you
swing by the Post?

05:23.866 --> 05:26.119
Wine, women, song...

05:27.870 --> 05:30.248
- We'll see.
- All right, then.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.334
I should go, uh,
check on my employee.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.091
Friend of yours?

05:44.053 --> 05:45.096
Ravi!

05:46.889 --> 05:48.391
There you are.
Have you seen a girl?

05:48.599 --> 05:49.726
Just Liv.
Who're you looking for?

05:49.934 --> 05:51.811
- Rachel.
- Your zombie truther friend?

05:52.186 --> 05:54.105
She escaped before us,
but I can't find her.

05:55.023 --> 05:56.107
Sorry, man.

05:59.068 --> 06:01.487
Know anything about a
Johns family compound
outside the city?

06:02.113 --> 06:02.780
No. Why?

06:02.989 --> 06:04.324
We've heard the brothers
talking about such a place

06:04.532 --> 06:06.117
on the bug we planted
in Harley's truck.

06:06.326 --> 06:08.328
Think you could use
police resources to help
track it down?

06:08.745 --> 06:09.537
Sir...

06:11.581 --> 06:14.125
Uh, we found these
in Harley's truck.

06:14.792 --> 06:17.420
N.V.M. 308. Ruger P89.

06:17.962 --> 06:20.423
Those are the models
used in the Baracus
assassination attempt

06:20.631 --> 06:21.632
and the Tuttle-Reid murders.

06:21.841 --> 06:23.926
This guy's responsible
for a lot of dead zombies.

06:24.135 --> 06:25.636
We need to find him,
and we need to find him now.

06:25.845 --> 06:28.264
I'll get my partner to track
down the Johns' property.

06:28.473 --> 06:30.933
I'll take these guns, too,
make sure the ballistics
are a match.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.061
It seems redundant,
but they're all yours.

06:33.936 --> 06:34.771
Keep me apprised.

06:38.107 --> 06:40.318
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. You?

06:40.735 --> 06:41.778
Good.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.404
You wanna come over later?

06:44.489 --> 06:47.283
Yes, ma'am. Yes, I do.

06:47.492 --> 06:49.619
You can pull a bunch of
buckshot out of my back.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.621
Ooh, kinky.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.456
You mind putting those
guns in my car?

06:53.664 --> 06:55.917
I want to check on Don E.
He was in bad shape.

06:59.128 --> 07:00.296
You were right, Blaine.

07:01.506 --> 07:03.341
Revenge is a dish
best served cold.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.261
Doesn't get much
fresher than this.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.307
How about you, you want in?

07:11.933 --> 07:12.809
I wouldn't say no.

07:17.814 --> 07:19.023
Save some for me.

07:19.232 --> 07:22.568
- Yeah!
- Pop a squat, girlfriend!

07:24.153 --> 07:25.488
This is a surprise.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.658
I thought you might have,
I dunno, "ethics" or
some such nonsense.

07:28.866 --> 07:32.870
My ethics are outweighed
by my need to find
where Harley is hiding.

07:33.079 --> 07:34.956
His brother's brain
might have some answers.

07:36.124 --> 07:37.291
This is nice.

07:37.917 --> 07:39.335
Should we make this
a weekly thing, or...

07:41.921 --> 07:43.172
Liv, you up here?

07:43.381 --> 07:44.966
I'm ready to go...

07:49.971 --> 07:51.806
I'll be in the car.

08:02.692 --> 08:04.152
What you got goin' on there?

08:05.361 --> 08:06.779
Oh, that's the sex fort.

08:07.738 --> 08:08.448
So...

08:09.031 --> 08:10.575
How was your London trip?

08:10.783 --> 08:12.702
Witty.

08:13.369 --> 08:14.829
Harley made me
call you with that excuse,

08:15.037 --> 08:16.914
so no one would wonder
why I didn't show up for work.

08:17.832 --> 08:18.875
No. Really.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.668
- What, you had
a slumber party?
- Hmm.

08:20.877 --> 08:22.545
It was more of a staycation.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.589
Remember Shawna, the girl who
wrote me that sweet letter?

08:24.797 --> 08:27.842
The big Chaos Killer fan?
You didn't.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.343
Oh, but I did.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.387
- Several times.
- Ah...

08:31.596 --> 08:34.015
It's not just sex, though.
I mean...

08:35.308 --> 08:37.643
Hmm. No, I mean,
it's mostly sex, but...

08:37.852 --> 08:39.687
She has a lot of
other qualities,

08:39.896 --> 08:43.232
and I... I cannot wait
to experience whatever
those are as well.

08:43.441 --> 08:46.527
I'm sure propriety and modesty
are high on that list.

08:46.736 --> 08:49.238
Hmm, all right, Carson.
You just worry about
Lady Mary.

08:54.285 --> 08:55.953
Rachel! Thank God.

08:56.162 --> 08:57.955
- Come in, come in.
- What did we just see?

08:58.456 --> 09:01.459
Those were actual zombies,
right? But they weren't
like movie zombies...

09:01.667 --> 09:03.628
- It was...
- Hey, hey, slow down.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.713
Uh, let me get you something
to help you unwind.

09:05.922 --> 09:08.382
- That's probably a good idea.
- Of course it is.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.761
What's that?

09:13.262 --> 09:16.140
- It's my roommate's sex fort.
- Oh.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.434
How did you escape?

09:18.643 --> 09:20.102
I was worried that you...

09:20.311 --> 09:22.021
All of that gunfire, and...

09:25.107 --> 09:26.567
Everything's okay now.

09:41.958 --> 09:44.460
- Oh, God...
- No, no.

09:44.669 --> 09:46.170
That's on me. Just...

09:46.379 --> 09:49.048
- The timing is bad.
I'm just...
- Hey!

09:50.800 --> 09:52.051
You must be Rachel.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.596
- I'm...
- Your roommate
is the Chaos Killer?

09:58.057 --> 09:59.725
I need to get out of here.

10:00.810 --> 10:02.144
Um, um... Rachel!

10:06.357 --> 10:09.110
Chaos Kidnapper
if you must know.

10:20.246 --> 10:21.872
I met your
roommate downstairs.

10:22.498 --> 10:24.125
He ravaged me with his eyes.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.544
- I'm gonna need you
to kick his ass.
- Can do!

10:27.044 --> 10:29.171
I'm really excited that
you're taking me dancing.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.383
- Who said I was
taking you dancing?
- I did... Just now.

10:32.592 --> 10:33.759
I'm meeting my friends
at Club Rush

10:33.968 --> 10:36.053
for "Death to Disco" night.
I want you to come.

10:37.054 --> 10:41.559
Yeah... I'm not so into
going out these days.

10:42.018 --> 10:45.855
In public. Like... Ever.

10:46.063 --> 10:49.358
I mentioned how Ravi's
lady friend ran away
at the sight of me, right?

10:50.067 --> 10:51.694
Only five or six times.

10:52.236 --> 10:53.738
Who cares what she thinks?

10:53.946 --> 10:57.575
It's not so much her as it is
the other three-and-a-half
million people

10:57.783 --> 10:59.118
in the greater Seattle
metro area

10:59.327 --> 11:01.329
who feel roughly
the same way about me.

11:01.537 --> 11:03.581
So they get to dictate
how you live your life?

11:04.832 --> 11:05.583
Hmm?

11:05.791 --> 11:07.251
I'm not getting off
until you say yes.

11:07.460 --> 11:08.836
Oh...

11:09.045 --> 11:10.880
I don't think you understand
how ultimatums work.

11:11.088 --> 11:12.006
Oh...

11:12.381 --> 11:16.677
Okay, smartass,
you're not getting off
until you say yes.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.767
All right.
I'll give it a shot.

11:23.017 --> 11:25.978
Now, I, uh,
believe we had a deal...

11:26.187 --> 11:27.938
Hmm.

11:28.147 --> 11:29.315
Hold that thought...

11:34.028 --> 11:35.821
I need to
immortalize this moment.

11:36.781 --> 11:38.032
A selfie stick?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.702
I knew this was
too good to be true.

11:41.911 --> 11:43.287
What else are you hiding?

11:44.205 --> 11:45.539
A lady never tells...

12:01.681 --> 12:04.308
- Oh...
- You awake?
I have Weckler news.

12:04.517 --> 12:06.894
That I have to
hear before coffee?

12:07.103 --> 12:09.480
Listen, Clive and I went
to see Gary Oberman,

12:09.689 --> 12:11.732
the prison guard
who killed Weckler,
and guess what?

12:11.941 --> 12:12.900
Oberman's dead, too.

12:13.109 --> 12:15.611
He treated himself
to a luxury cruise,
and then fell overboard.

12:15.820 --> 12:16.737
Or didn't.

12:16.946 --> 12:18.614
He could be the king of Baja
for all we know.

12:18.823 --> 12:20.324
That's... That's odd.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.451
Then we interviewed
Weckler's daughter, Tatum.

12:22.660 --> 12:24.286
The kid was evasive,
like someone had got to her.

12:24.495 --> 12:25.871
This case is bigger
than we thought.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.999
I'm thinking deep state.
Shadow government.

12:30.543 --> 12:31.627
Wait...

12:31.836 --> 12:32.878
The government's involved?

12:33.087 --> 12:35.005
Well, not the "government"
government, obviously.

12:35.214 --> 12:37.591
But the people behind the
government, the Illuminati.

12:41.512 --> 12:42.513
Liv...

12:43.472 --> 12:44.724
Whose brain have you eaten?

12:46.142 --> 12:47.017
Who wants to know?

12:47.852 --> 12:49.437
I do. That's why I asked.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.815
Bo Johns'...

12:53.023 --> 12:55.443
One of the zombie truthers'
ringleaders.

12:55.651 --> 12:57.862
- I guess he was a bit...
- Excitable? Paranoid?

12:59.155 --> 12:59.905
Insane?

13:00.656 --> 13:02.491
- Yeah.
- Got it.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.493
So, how much of
what you just told me
was actually true,

13:04.702 --> 13:06.328
and how much was theoretical?

13:08.205 --> 13:10.249
- If Liv and Blaine hadn't
arrived when they did...
- I'm sorry, Ravi.

13:10.458 --> 13:12.960
I should have talked you
out of going undercover
with those guys.

13:13.169 --> 13:15.963
My desire to find
Wally and Anna's killer
got the best of me.

13:18.591 --> 13:19.633
Liv?

13:53.375 --> 13:54.668
Did you bring
Clive up to speed?

13:54.877 --> 13:56.504
- Yes, I did!
- Good.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.423
We found these
in Harley's truck.

13:59.924 --> 14:01.217
- Where?
- Harley's truck.

14:01.425 --> 14:02.343
What?

14:05.179 --> 14:08.933
I believe this is
the result of eating
Bo Johns' brain,

14:09.308 --> 14:13.103
a man who insisted to me
that zombies were the creation
of the Shah of Iran.

14:13.312 --> 14:15.981
These precautions
aren't necessary, Liv.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.859
You're right. Sorry.

14:19.610 --> 14:20.945
These were in Harley's truck.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.489
They're the same type
of guns used in
the Baracus shooting...

14:24.406 --> 14:25.616
And Wally's murder.

14:25.825 --> 14:27.910
I thought we should run
ballistics to confirm.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.788
If Cavanaugh learns
we have these,
he'll go ballistic,

14:31.455 --> 14:34.667
so it'll have to
be off the books,
but I know a guy.

14:35.376 --> 14:38.128
Ravi told me about the
mystery Johns family estate.

14:38.337 --> 14:39.797
I requisitioned
property records,

14:40.005 --> 14:41.757
but it'll take a couple days
to get the results back.

14:42.466 --> 14:43.467
Any other leads?

14:43.676 --> 14:45.886
We could try wandering
around Wham Bam's.

14:46.095 --> 14:47.263
Might trigger
a Bo Johns vision.

14:47.471 --> 14:49.431
That's better than nothing.
Let's go.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.728
Uh, something's
occurred to me...

14:56.105 --> 14:58.649
I may have a suggestion
for tripling your odds.

15:02.611 --> 15:04.154
All those people that night
on the street in Vegas,

15:04.363 --> 15:05.489
no one sees a shooter!

15:05.698 --> 15:07.324
It's because
he didn't get shot.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.118
Look at the cover of <i>Don Killuminati.</i>

15:09.326 --> 15:10.619
There's Tupac crucified,

15:10.828 --> 15:12.246
and in the liner notes
it reads, and I quote,

15:12.454 --> 15:14.957
"Exit Tupac, enter Makaveli."

15:15.165 --> 15:17.251
He is alive and well, and will
return like a new messiah.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.503
- That's insane.
- Oh, so you think he's dead?

15:19.712 --> 15:20.963
No, of course he's not dead.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.798
He's working for
the Feds as an informant.

15:23.007 --> 15:25.593
- He's mowing his lawn
in Scottsdale.
- Stop!

15:25.801 --> 15:27.303
You two sound crazy.

15:27.511 --> 15:29.847
Sad to say,
but Tupac is dead and gone.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.642
Biggie Smalls' twin brother
killed Tupac,

15:33.851 --> 15:35.978
and it's that twin
that got shot in LA.

15:36.186 --> 15:39.064
Biggie, at this moment,
is sipping mojitos in Havana.

15:39.273 --> 15:40.566
Okay.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.694
Can we head over
to Wham Bam's now?

15:43.903 --> 15:44.862
Yeah, all right.

15:48.324 --> 15:49.283
Ms. Charles?

15:49.575 --> 15:52.161
James Weckler's
personal effects from county
just arrived for you.

15:52.369 --> 15:53.787
Great. Right here's fine.

16:26.195 --> 16:28.697
We're up two more points.
We might just win this thing.

16:28.906 --> 16:31.659
- Can I count on your vote?
- Of course. Good luck!

16:40.542 --> 16:44.004
Our tech department's
disinformation campaign
has been reasonably effective.

16:44.213 --> 16:47.967
Most people still talking
about the live stream
believe it's "leaked footage"

16:48.175 --> 16:50.302
from some <i>Blair Witch</i>-like
feature film.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.389
I know.
Small victories, Miss Gold.

16:53.597 --> 16:54.765
The troops are
on edge, though.

16:55.557 --> 16:58.394
None of them think
Zombie Island will be ready
before Discovery Day arrives.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.854
The civilian population
feels differently.

17:01.689 --> 17:03.732
They're still hopeful we can
avoid direct confrontation.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.192
Sir, I...

17:05.401 --> 17:07.236
I was told
I could find you here...

17:07.903 --> 17:10.030
- It can wait.
- You're not a six-year-old,

17:10.239 --> 17:11.573
talk to me.

17:11.865 --> 17:16.620
Uh, sir, yesterday,
at Wham Bam's, I had
a bite of Bo Johns' brain.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.080
I just had a vision.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.540
I know where
to find their cabin.

17:26.672 --> 17:29.258
Get your squad geared up.
Get ready to go in 30 minutes.

17:29.466 --> 17:30.467
Copy.

17:30.676 --> 17:33.595
Should I notify our friends at
the Seattle Police Department?

17:33.804 --> 17:36.306
No. They've done all they can.

17:38.017 --> 17:39.393
It's our turn now.

17:52.406 --> 17:54.533
I'm sorry you had
to come all the way
down here for this.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.578
I know this
must be hard for you.

17:59.371 --> 18:01.248
But I wanted to talk to you
about your dad.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.752
You know he didn't
kill himself, right?

18:05.753 --> 18:07.046
That's what I was told.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.549
We know he had
a memory card in his
possession when he died.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.887
There's incriminating footage
of some powerful people on it.

18:16.889 --> 18:18.724
I think one of those people
killed your father.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.476
Can I just take
this stuff and go?

18:21.310 --> 18:22.269
I have to get home.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.276
This was in your dad's wallet.

18:30.986 --> 18:32.780
- Do you know what this is?
- A key?

18:33.781 --> 18:35.282
For a safe deposit box.

18:36.575 --> 18:38.118
You are the sole heir,
so it belongs to you.

18:38.327 --> 18:42.706
But I was hoping that you
would let me come along
when you open the box.

18:42.915 --> 18:43.916
I don't think so.

18:44.833 --> 18:45.626
Okay.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.630
I understand.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.176
Which bank?

18:56.136 --> 18:57.262
Hard to say.

18:58.013 --> 19:00.974
I mean, if you worked in
the DA's office, you'd just
have the imprint scanned.

19:01.183 --> 19:06.563
But, if you don't, then I
guess you have to get a list
of the 342 banks in Seattle,

19:06.772 --> 19:10.400
start visiting them
one by one, hope for the best.

19:10.609 --> 19:11.777
So uncool.

19:17.616 --> 19:20.285
You might not care who
killed your father, Tatum,
but I do.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.497
All I want is the memory card.

19:26.125 --> 19:28.627
Then you never have to see
my uncool ass ever again.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.431
Take your time.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.485
This was my mother's...

20:06.415 --> 20:07.291
It's here.

20:12.546 --> 20:13.255
Thank you.

20:15.549 --> 20:16.592
I should go.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.051
I'm already super late.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.678
No, I'll give you a ride.
It's not a problem.

20:19.887 --> 20:21.513
There's a bus
that'll pick me up right...

20:28.729 --> 20:30.731
- Tatum?
- Sorry.

20:30.939 --> 20:33.275
Brain freeze.
I gotta go catch that bus.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.529
Dude, it couldn't be
more obvious!

20:37.738 --> 20:43.493
Cruise's tan is way too even,
and he's barely aged a day
in 30 years.

20:43.702 --> 20:46.997
Why do you think he does
his own death-defying stunts?
It's 'cause he's already dead.

20:47.206 --> 20:50.209
I'll bet he doesn't
eat the brain of anyone
over the age of 25.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.294
So I should be thinking,
"That's a raged-out zombie,"

20:52.502 --> 20:55.088
next time I see Tom Cruise
doing a chase sequence?

20:58.425 --> 20:59.384
What the hell?

21:03.138 --> 21:04.765
Did... Did you see that?

21:04.973 --> 21:06.683
- In the woods?
- Inside Harley's truck.

21:06.892 --> 21:09.436
Wow, did we just have
a three-way?

21:09.895 --> 21:11.813
- What was the vision?
- It was a zombie

21:12.105 --> 21:13.398
chasing down Harley's truck.

21:13.607 --> 21:16.109
Oh! It was the dude
you brought to
The Scratching Post.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.612
- What was the vision?
- It's news we already knew.

21:18.820 --> 21:21.406
We're in Harley's truck,
Liv squeezes in
our headlights,

21:21.615 --> 21:24.534
frothing at the mouth.
He wants our brains, man!

21:24.743 --> 21:27.287
I yell, "Go! Go! Go!"

21:27.496 --> 21:29.081
Harley guns it in reverse.

21:29.289 --> 21:32.042
Her friend is chasing us down
going like 60 miles an hour.

21:32.251 --> 21:33.627
That's a slight exaggeration.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.379
- Dude, I was there!
- We were all there.

21:35.587 --> 21:37.172
This was on YouTube
for God's sake.

21:37.381 --> 21:39.841
Now how 'bout you two continue
your vision hunt downstairs,

21:40.050 --> 21:42.135
and see if we can
cover more territory.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.804
- Sure.
- Why not?

21:46.181 --> 21:51.478
Liv, I know it must be tough
having someone else's thoughts
swimming around in your head.

21:51.687 --> 21:54.982
But we're looking for the man
that's most likely responsible
for Wally's murder.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.316
I need you to focus.

21:58.277 --> 21:59.820
I know why the
radio's been acting up.

22:00.028 --> 22:01.822
Zombies put a bug
behind the dash.

22:02.030 --> 22:04.491
They know everywhere we go
and everything we say.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.201
Did you get rid of it?

22:06.410 --> 22:08.578
Hell, no. We're gonna
use it against them.

22:08.787 --> 22:09.788
Take a few out.

22:13.917 --> 22:14.543
What'd you see?

22:22.301 --> 22:23.719
Lilywhite and Bell,
in position.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.805
- Hold tight.
<i>- Copy.</i>

22:34.855 --> 22:36.898
- Text from Liv.
- Same.

22:37.983 --> 22:41.320
"Harley knew his truck
was bugged, he wants you
to know about the cabin."

22:45.073 --> 22:46.366
It's a trap.

22:47.951 --> 22:52.039
Sir, our intel is faulty,
repeat, intel
is compromised, over.

22:52.247 --> 22:54.666
- What makes you say that?
- I just received a text
from Liv Moore.

22:54.875 --> 22:56.918
She said Harley knew about
the bug in his truck.

23:00.839 --> 23:02.549
All units, fall back.
Confirm receipt.

23:02.758 --> 23:04.384
<i>Hurley, Coyne, confirmed.</i>

23:05.010 --> 23:07.095
<i>Clarke, Fallwell, confirmed.</i>

23:07.304 --> 23:08.889
Lilywhite, Bell, confirmed.

23:12.184 --> 23:13.602
Finnegan, Coombs, acknowledge.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.437
Do not press forward.
Fall back.

23:17.481 --> 23:19.524
Finnegan, Coombs, acknowledge!

23:48.762 --> 23:51.973
Sorry. Bad habit
I've developed recently.

23:52.182 --> 23:54.893
Harley killed
two more Fillmore-Graves
soldiers yesterday.

23:55.102 --> 23:56.978
- Oh, no.
- Lured them into a minefield.

23:57.187 --> 24:00.065
Thank God no one else
was hurt. Justin was
pretty messed up over it.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.441
You know what I think?

24:01.650 --> 24:03.652
Harley's whole
redneck persona is a cover.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.404
No way some wacko gun-nut

24:05.612 --> 24:08.365
outsmarts an experienced
military commander
like Chase Graves.

24:08.573 --> 24:10.450
He must've worked
in counterintelligence,
Black Ops...

24:10.659 --> 24:13.620
Respectfully, Liv, if you're
going to find Harley,

24:13.829 --> 24:16.790
you have to try to separate
the facts from these theories.

24:16.998 --> 24:19.042
You have to try
to limit your suspicions.

24:19.251 --> 24:20.585
I know, you're right.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.172
Wait a minute, why are you
sleeping in here?

24:24.673 --> 24:28.135
Major's been having
a lot of... Company.

24:28.802 --> 24:34.641
And this company
happens to be very
expressive in the boudoir

24:34.850 --> 24:37.102
which now constitutes
most of our house.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.479
Shawna?
I don't trust that girl.

24:40.355 --> 24:41.731
No surprises there.

24:42.023 --> 24:45.444
This isn't
paranoid brain talking.
I want Major to be happy.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.320
But there's
something off about her.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.448
She said they were pen pals.
I smell a lie.

24:49.656 --> 24:52.033
It did start with a letter.

24:52.242 --> 24:55.412
She wrote to the Chaos Killer,
told him she believed
in his innocence.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.956
- And included
a photo of herself?
- Hmm.

24:59.082 --> 25:00.625
So much for her innocence.

25:03.628 --> 25:05.422
What did you say
her last name was?

25:07.716 --> 25:08.884
Uh...

25:09.759 --> 25:12.220
And what am I
looking at here?
Shawna's Tumblr page.

25:12.429 --> 25:13.388
Scroll down.

25:15.849 --> 25:16.850
What?

25:18.810 --> 25:19.895
Oh, my God!

25:20.103 --> 25:21.646
What the hell?
I'm all over it!

25:23.482 --> 25:25.567
- Those are texts
we sent each other.
- Yeah.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.360
You can't un-see
some of those.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.989
The video she took of me?
All of these pictures...

25:32.240 --> 25:33.366
I'm sorry...

25:33.575 --> 25:34.659
I thought you should know.

25:35.452 --> 25:36.786
Oh, I almost forgot.

25:38.914 --> 25:41.583
Gross. There's literally
a trash can right next to you.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.001
They're always watching.

25:43.585 --> 25:47.672
- And I don't want you to freak
out, but I think Shawna's...
- Crazy?

25:47.881 --> 25:50.383
A zombie hunter
trained by the CDC.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.928
Getting close to you is
step one of a nine-step plan.

25:53.136 --> 25:55.639
- Step two...
- I'm going to stick
with she's crazy,

25:55.847 --> 25:58.600
and she's using me for
some kind of weird notoriety.

26:00.477 --> 26:01.728
I'm so sorry, Major.

26:06.024 --> 26:07.067
Hey.

26:09.694 --> 26:10.612
Hey.

26:11.029 --> 26:14.241
Uh, I've been
trying to reach you.

26:14.449 --> 26:17.118
I do have your real
number and name, right?

26:17.327 --> 26:18.787
I got your messages.

26:18.995 --> 26:21.331
Sorry. I was still
pretty freaked out.

26:21.540 --> 26:22.791
It's a lot to process.

26:23.542 --> 26:24.209
Huh...

26:25.877 --> 26:26.920
Oh...

26:28.713 --> 26:32.592
There's zombies protecting
Chaos Killer victims,

26:33.343 --> 26:36.179
zombies protecting each other,
you protecting zombies,

26:36.388 --> 26:39.266
and then, I find out you're
living with the Chaos Killer.

26:41.643 --> 26:42.852
Correct.

26:44.437 --> 26:46.106
Are you a zombie?

26:46.982 --> 26:48.358
Uh...

26:48.567 --> 26:50.610
- I am not.
- Okay.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.113
But are you really?

26:55.198 --> 26:55.907
No.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.285
Look, check my pulse.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.002
Okay...

27:09.004 --> 27:10.005
You're human.

27:11.673 --> 27:15.510
And a doctor. And kinda
my friend, I thought.

27:15.719 --> 27:18.430
So help me wrap my head
around this.

27:19.055 --> 27:22.684
I've seen a zombie
get cattle-prodded.

27:22.892 --> 27:26.813
I've seen zombies
bust down doors and
crash through skylights.

27:27.022 --> 27:30.066
I've seen the
Chaos Killer's sex fort!

27:31.276 --> 27:33.570
How much crazier can
the rest of the story be?

27:36.865 --> 27:41.703
What if I told you that yes,
zombies are real,

27:41.911 --> 27:44.205
and yes, they eat brains...

27:44.414 --> 27:45.832
But they're not monsters.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.209
Most of them, anyway.

27:49.044 --> 27:50.587
They're just like you and me.

27:51.921 --> 27:54.799
I already told you about
the Lake Washington
boat party massacre.

27:55.008 --> 27:57.385
But there's
a lot I left out...

27:57.594 --> 27:59.471
Justin said his unit
marked a safe path

27:59.679 --> 28:01.556
through the landmines
and checked out the cabin.

28:01.765 --> 28:03.683
It looked like no one
had been inside for months.

28:03.892 --> 28:04.893
So it was a trap.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.436
Babineaux.

28:07.145 --> 28:09.064
This guy says he sold you
some concert tickets?

28:09.272 --> 28:11.107
Uh, yeah, that's right.

28:12.108 --> 28:12.984
Cool.

28:13.902 --> 28:14.944
Who are you gonna go see?

28:16.696 --> 28:17.697
Music.

28:20.116 --> 28:21.076
Thanks.

28:22.077 --> 28:23.036
Yeah...

28:26.456 --> 28:28.249
Axel, this is Liv. Liv, Axel.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.795
- What's with
the glasses, Axel?
- What's with the skin, Liv?

28:33.088 --> 28:34.714
Relax, both of you.

28:35.340 --> 28:36.841
He's my ballistics guy.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.761
These are from the handgun
and the rifle you gave me.

28:39.969 --> 28:43.098
Striations on the slugs
are identical to the ones
from each of the crime scenes.

28:45.934 --> 28:48.103
Whoever these guns belong to
is your shooter.

28:50.814 --> 28:52.023
What's with that guy?

28:59.739 --> 29:02.659
What's going on?
Why aren't you dressed?

29:02.867 --> 29:05.328
- You okay?
- Not really.

29:06.329 --> 29:08.581
- I saw your Tumblr page.
- Okay...

29:09.958 --> 29:12.961
You know, I get that
exploiting other people
for their fame is a thing,

29:13.169 --> 29:15.296
but couldn't you have
at least asked me first?

29:15.505 --> 29:17.799
Whoa, whoa...
Who's exploiting you?

29:19.008 --> 29:22.303
You posted stuff
that was private.
It was just between us.

29:22.512 --> 29:24.514
I'm trying to help you, Major.

29:26.015 --> 29:27.809
You're basically a hermit
because all anyone sees

29:28.017 --> 29:30.145
when they look at you
is the Chaos Killer.

29:30.353 --> 29:32.105
I'm showing them
the real Major,

29:32.313 --> 29:37.986
the one who is sweet,
and smart, and funny,
and charming.

29:38.194 --> 29:41.030
And, okay,
pretty easy on the eyes.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.908
Don't you think it's time
someone told that story?

29:45.160 --> 29:47.203
I don't want to be any story.

29:48.163 --> 29:51.332
I just want to go back to when
nobody knew who I was.

29:51.833 --> 29:52.959
Oh, baby.

29:53.752 --> 29:55.336
That ship has sailed.

29:56.463 --> 29:59.382
Look, if the posts
bother you that much,
I'll take them down.

30:00.383 --> 30:01.634
Okay?

30:02.635 --> 30:04.846
Can we call that
the end of our first fight?

30:05.054 --> 30:09.392
Maybe hold a peace treaty
signing ceremony in Fort Us?

30:17.358 --> 30:18.485
I'm sorry, Shawna.

30:22.530 --> 30:23.990
I can't see you anymore.

30:24.866 --> 30:25.992
Are you serious?

30:27.494 --> 30:28.495
Yeah.

30:31.289 --> 30:32.332
Fine.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.629
Good luck
finding a time machine.

30:59.108 --> 31:00.985
Outside in 10, gentlemen.

31:01.194 --> 31:02.862
We're running
D-Day simulations.

31:03.112 --> 31:05.406
You know what's out there,
let's make sure
we're ready for it.

31:06.825 --> 31:09.244
And get your butts
to a polling place
as soon as we're done.

31:09.452 --> 31:12.247
We'll need one of our own
running this city when
all hell breaks loose.

31:14.791 --> 31:17.794
And if you happen to pass
Pike Place on your way home...

31:18.002 --> 31:19.462
Make sure you grab
one of these.

31:29.305 --> 31:30.265
Uh...

31:35.770 --> 31:37.814
<i>It's neck-and-neck
in this special election</i>

31:38.022 --> 31:40.817
<i>to replace Mayor Gwen Davis,
who resigned for
health reasons...</i>

31:42.610 --> 31:44.445
Where've you been?
I've been calling and texting.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.906
You prefer skywriting?

31:47.115 --> 31:48.658
Only if it was encrypted.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.827
I switched to a burner phone.

31:51.035 --> 31:53.621
I got one for you too.
You never know
who's listening.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.583
I'm good. Sit down,
I've a lot to catch you up on.

31:58.084 --> 32:00.253
James Weckler
had a safe deposit box.

32:00.879 --> 32:02.881
I convinced Tatum to let me
come along when she opened it.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.215
Guess what was inside?

32:04.924 --> 32:07.886
The memory card Weckler stole
from Roxanne's hidden camera.

32:08.094 --> 32:09.762
It was recording
when he killed her.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.265
Look.

32:12.473 --> 32:14.142
Hey, hey, here,
who's he calling?

32:14.350 --> 32:15.768
<i>It's James...</i>

32:15.977 --> 32:17.979
<i>Uh, no, not yet.</i>

32:18.187 --> 32:19.689
<i>It, uh, it went bad.</i>

32:19.898 --> 32:22.567
<i>She caught me,
I had to, uh... She's dead...</i>

32:23.234 --> 32:24.652
<i>I had to kill her!</i>

32:25.403 --> 32:28.489
<i>No. You made me do this,
you have to help me fix it!</i>

32:29.699 --> 32:30.783
<i>Okay...</i>

32:31.993 --> 32:33.244
<i>Okay.</i>

32:33.453 --> 32:34.454
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:38.207 --> 32:41.669
Obviously, whoever he was
talking to also made him
steal that card.

32:43.254 --> 32:45.840
- Hey!
- Just trying to protect you.

32:46.424 --> 32:47.592
Whatever, all right.

32:48.134 --> 32:49.677
I haven't even gotten
to the big news.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.221
Remember the
phone call from prison?

32:52.430 --> 32:54.849
- Weckler asked Tatum, "Are
they keeping you well-fed?"
- Yeah.

32:55.058 --> 32:56.851
He wanted to make sure
she was well-fed.

32:57.602 --> 32:58.853
In brains!

32:59.771 --> 33:01.564
- Tatum's a zombie.
- What!

33:01.773 --> 33:03.149
I saw her go into a vision.

33:04.734 --> 33:05.860
Frak me running.

33:07.445 --> 33:09.572
Who would most want to
keep Weckler quiet,

33:09.781 --> 33:13.034
but also know how to best
threaten his zombie daughter?

33:14.243 --> 33:15.244
Baracus.

33:16.621 --> 33:18.331
He's somewhere
in this footage,

33:18.957 --> 33:21.960
dressed in leather chaps,
begging for Roxanne
to whip him.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.211
Oh, God.

33:23.419 --> 33:26.047
He knows his political career
is over if any of that
footage gets out.

33:26.255 --> 33:28.841
But he can't risk
getting caught trying
to steal it himself.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.134
I checked the records.

33:30.635 --> 33:34.722
Baracus prosecuted
Weckler's B&E arrest
when he was an ADA.

33:35.473 --> 33:37.934
He got his patsy,
now he needs leverage,

33:38.142 --> 33:41.104
which he gets when
he finds out that Weckler
has a daughter.

33:41.312 --> 33:43.106
So Baracus turns
Tatum into a zombie,

33:43.314 --> 33:47.235
promises to keep her in brains
as long as Weckler steals
the memory card for him.

33:47.443 --> 33:49.946
Weckler screws up,
he kills Roxanne,

33:50.154 --> 33:52.657
and so Baracus gets a
prison guard to kill Weckler.

33:52.865 --> 33:56.911
Then Baracus gets that same
prison guard thrown overboard,
off a cruise ship.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.623
I buy the blackmail,
but I'm not sure
Baracus is a serial killer.

34:00.832 --> 34:02.041
He is definitely
mixed up in this.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.210
- And I just voted for him.
- So did I.

34:08.881 --> 34:10.675
<i>All right, we did it!</i>

34:11.259 --> 34:12.844
Seattle has a zombie mayor.

34:13.052 --> 34:15.388
<i>...because this victory
belongs to all of us...</i>

34:15.596 --> 34:17.056
Who is possibly
also a murderer.

34:17.265 --> 34:19.517
<i>We could not have
done this without you.</i>

34:21.561 --> 34:22.645
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

34:22.854 --> 34:25.314
<i>Didn't you say Harley's cabin
had been abandoned for months?</i>

34:25.523 --> 34:26.733
Well, that's what
Justin told me.

34:26.941 --> 34:28.484
Then why am I looking at
a noise complaint

34:28.693 --> 34:33.239
about heavy machinery and
construction going on at
that address eight weeks ago?

34:33.448 --> 34:36.325
- I don't know.
But I have a theory...
- I'm sure you do.

34:36.534 --> 34:38.995
<i>Tell me tomorrow,
when we head out there.
Good night, Liv.</i>

34:39.203 --> 34:41.664
<i>Let's enjoy this win tonight,</i>

34:41.873 --> 34:45.126
<i>because tomorrow,
the real work begins.</i>

34:46.961 --> 34:48.504
Yeah, that's a great column.

34:48.713 --> 34:50.923
For your college newspaper.
Next!

34:51.132 --> 34:53.176
"DA Baracus snatches victory

34:53.384 --> 34:54.552
"from the jaws of defeat."

34:54.719 --> 34:56.345
I pity the fool
that has to read that.

34:56.554 --> 34:57.930
All right, give me
1,000 words of your best

34:58.139 --> 34:59.432
Monday-morning quarterbacking.
What else we got?

34:59.640 --> 35:01.184
The Chaos Killer's been
selling T-shirts of himself,

35:01.392 --> 35:02.685
profiteering off
his notoriety.

35:02.894 --> 35:05.897
Think piece on who's buying
them, what it says about
our society, blah, blah, blah.

35:06.105 --> 35:08.316
Sold...
And I'm a size large. Next?

35:08.983 --> 35:11.861
I have a friend from college
who's an intern at St. Thomas.

35:12.070 --> 35:15.531
There's been a couple of cases
of some SARS-like virus
they can't identify.

35:15.740 --> 35:18.326
- They say it might get bad.
- All right, dig into it.

35:18.534 --> 35:19.535
Get back to me
when you got more.

35:20.870 --> 35:21.662
Scoot.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.875
Oh, nice of you to grace us
with your presence.

35:26.751 --> 35:29.796
So, any update on your
"wingnuts who believe
in zombies" story?

35:30.630 --> 35:32.215
There have been
a few developments.

35:32.423 --> 35:34.467
You might want to make
some room on the front page.

35:42.892 --> 35:45.937
Neighbors a quarter
mile away complained about
construction noise.

35:46.437 --> 35:47.688
Construction of what?

36:05.123 --> 36:08.459
Forget heavy equipment.
This place hasn't even
seen a vacuum cleaner.

36:09.252 --> 36:12.421
Hey, wait till you hear the
latest on the Weckler case.

36:12.630 --> 36:15.716
We think that Weckler
was being blackmailed
by Baracus,

36:15.925 --> 36:17.844
who turned Weckler's daughter
into a zombie,

36:18.052 --> 36:20.721
then had Oberman
kill Weckler, and then

36:20.930 --> 36:24.809
covered his tracks by having
Oberman "accidentally" fall
overboard from a cruise ship.

36:25.017 --> 36:28.271
Did Baracus then have
whoever pushed Oberman
overboard whacked?

36:28.479 --> 36:30.690
He's dirty, Clive.
You heard it here first.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.251
Anything?

36:51.210 --> 36:52.879
You're the
conspiracy theorist.

36:53.838 --> 36:56.132
Why would you need to
build a new outhouse

36:56.340 --> 36:58.509
when you already have
indoor plumbing?

37:04.682 --> 37:05.975
Notice anything unusual?

37:06.184 --> 37:07.560
Yeah.
It doesn't stink.

37:32.919 --> 37:34.795
I think I found that
new construction.

38:27.390 --> 38:28.516
Harley Johns...

38:29.016 --> 38:31.435
You're under arrest for
the murder of Fred Tuttle,

38:31.602 --> 38:34.689
- Anna Reid and Wally Reid.
- I didn't kill those people.

38:34.897 --> 38:37.858
The murder weapon
we found in your truck
tells a different story.

38:38.067 --> 38:40.611
Just give me a reason...

38:40.820 --> 38:42.738
<i>Harley, got yer ears on?</i>

38:44.865 --> 38:47.952
- Little busy, Wade.
- I'll holler at ya later.

38:49.036 --> 38:50.454
Hey! That's it.

38:50.663 --> 38:52.957
The message board said
that's where zombies live.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.419
What the hell?

38:56.627 --> 38:58.587
Someone's shooting in there!
Get us the hell
out of here, man!

39:23.321 --> 39:25.364
It doesn't bring
Wally or Anna back.

39:27.283 --> 39:28.951
Hell, it doesn't
even feel good.

39:30.536 --> 39:31.579
I thought it would.

39:32.830 --> 39:34.165
He didn't do it.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.753
- What?
- He didn't kill Wally or Anna.

39:39.128 --> 39:39.920
I had a vision.

39:40.129 --> 39:44.342
Harley was in his truck with
Bo outside Wally's house
when the murders happened.

39:46.177 --> 39:48.429
He looked completely startled.
It wasn't him.

39:53.100 --> 39:55.561
I just killed an innocent man.

40:02.109 --> 40:03.402
Oh, my God.
