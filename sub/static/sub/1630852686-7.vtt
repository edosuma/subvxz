WEBVTT

00:15.557 --> 00:17.935
- Son, this is the story

00:17.935 --> 00:21.480
of my first life-changing opportunity
as a photographer.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.650
SOPHIE'S SON : Okay.
At least your work stories have less sex.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.777
- True,

00:26.777 --> 00:28.904
but this one has drugs.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.991
- Hi, you must be Amber.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.326
We spoke on the phone.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.912
I'm Sophie Tompkins,
here to see Naomi Reisberg.

00:36.912 --> 00:40.332
I can't believe
I'm saying those words out loud.

00:40.332 --> 00:43.752
I have idolized Ms. Reisberg
since forever.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.839
And now, she wants to meet me...

00:46.839 --> 00:49.842
Oh, it's just been a dream
to show in her gallery, and...

00:50.759 --> 00:52.427
I even wore my good luck bangles!

00:53.095 --> 00:56.348
- Naomi,
Shortie McTalkie is here to see you.

00:58.851 --> 01:01.270
Everyone in our system has a nickname.
Nothing personal.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.982
- That felt personal. Don't care.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.733
I'm meeting Naomi Reisberg.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.528
Honestly, this is such an honor.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.281
You know, I submitted my work
a couple months ago,

01:12.281 --> 01:13.991
and I never heard back
so then I just assumed

01:13.991 --> 01:15.784
that you weren't interested
in showing my photographs--

01:15.784 --> 01:17.661
- Oh, I'm not.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.373
My daughter Rivka's
bat mitzvah is this Saturday,

01:21.373 --> 01:23.709
and our photographer
dropped out at the last second.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.587
So, I had Amber dig
through our submissions

01:26.587 --> 01:30.215
to find someone halfway decent
who'd be available, and that's you.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.467
Halfway decent and available.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.346
- Uh... Thanks?

01:37.014 --> 01:40.475
I really thought you called me
in here about my artistic work.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.021
You didn't even look at my portfolio?
- No.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.690
I looked at the event
photography on your web site.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.943
- Oh. Cool. Cool.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.654
- Listen, Sophie, I never do this,

01:52.654 --> 01:54.698
but I'm three days out from the party,

01:54.698 --> 01:56.742
and it's either you
or my mom and her iPad.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.119
So, how about this?

01:59.703 --> 02:01.622
You do a good job on Saturday,

02:01.622 --> 02:04.249
and I'll take a look
at your artistic portfolio.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.461
- Oh my god! That would be amazing!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.505
- Great.
- Okay.

02:09.505 --> 02:11.590
- My baby only becomes a woman once,

02:11.590 --> 02:14.384
and this party is a who's who
of New York royalty,

02:14.384 --> 02:16.512
so I want every moment captured.

02:16.512 --> 02:19.097
Lin-Manuel Miranda gives a speech? Photo.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.891
Billy Porter eats a lettuce wrap? Photo.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.936
Anderson Cooper gets wasted
and dances by himself

02:23.936 --> 02:26.230
to the new Adele song?
Photo, photo, photo!

02:27.564 --> 02:30.067
Obviously, you'll need to bring
your best assistant.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.361
- Obviously.

02:32.361 --> 02:35.489
Yeah. I mean, I never go
anywhere without my assistant.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.951
Who do you think's parking
my car right now?

02:44.039 --> 02:47.000
- Look at you literally whistling
while you work.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.753
I've never seen you this
happy with your pants on.

02:50.212 --> 02:53.715
- Well, what can I say?
I love earning an honest living.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.718
Although, now you mention it,
this job would be heaven without pants.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.721
Ellen, what are your plans for today?

02:59.721 --> 03:02.182
- I'm working on my memoirs.
And by working,

03:02.182 --> 03:04.434
I mean reading
one celebrity memoir a week.

03:04.434 --> 03:08.146
And by reading, I mean listening,
so my hands are free for snacking.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.608
- Don't you miss working?

03:11.608 --> 03:14.528
- I'm... figuring out my next career move.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.697
And I can get by on the checks
from my farm, so--

03:16.697 --> 03:18.323
- You see, work gives me a purpose,

03:18.323 --> 03:20.117
and a drive,

03:20.117 --> 03:22.452
and the self-esteem
of a nerd in Silicon Valley.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.539
I mean, just look at all these five-star
Yelp reviews I've received.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.708
"Love that British bartender."

03:27.708 --> 03:28.667
Eh?

03:28.667 --> 03:30.627
"Come for the drinks,
stay for the Charlie."

03:30.627 --> 03:32.880
- Hey!
- And my personal favorite,

03:32.880 --> 03:35.424
"That British hunk is so hot

03:35.424 --> 03:38.427
that I started drinking again
just to see him."

03:38.969 --> 03:40.012
That's not good.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.973
- Ahem!

03:42.973 --> 03:44.850
You are looking at

03:44.850 --> 03:46.518
the official photographer

03:46.518 --> 03:49.688
for renowned gallerist Naomi Reisberg's...

03:50.439 --> 03:52.733
...daughter's bat mitzvah on Saturday!

03:53.525 --> 03:56.236
- Aw, you're doing that thing
where you say, like,

03:56.236 --> 03:58.447
sad words in a happy voice. I do it.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.325
:
This bar is hemorrhaging money!

04:01.992 --> 04:03.911
- Okay, I know it's not exactly

04:03.911 --> 04:05.704
what I was hoping for,

04:05.704 --> 04:08.248
but Naomi did say that
she would look at my portfolio

04:08.248 --> 04:10.042
if I crushed the bat mitzvah photos.

04:10.042 --> 04:13.337
Which I plan on doing with
the help of my assistant...

04:13.337 --> 04:15.130
Valentina.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.174
- Oh! I can't.

04:17.174 --> 04:19.384
I have to go into the office on Saturday.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.595
We're dressing, like,
six huge names for a premiere,

04:21.595 --> 04:23.889
and I still need
to accessorize Timothée Chalamet.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.475
SOPHIE'S SON:
Wait, Timothée Chalamet, the pro wrestler?

04:26.475 --> 04:29.937
- Yep. Back then,
he was a tiny little movie star.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.982
- God, your job is so cool.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.027
I mean, your career is in the fast lane,

04:37.027 --> 04:39.279
and my career is hitchhiking
on the side of the road,

04:39.279 --> 04:40.531
and there's no takers.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.866
- Okay, fine.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.160
Let's, uh, bat that mitzvah.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.119
- Yes!

04:46.119 --> 04:49.248
- Oh, Charlie, I need you
to pick up a shift on Saturday.

04:49.248 --> 04:52.000
Jesse and I are doing
a classic Pound Day.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.919
- I'm sorry, what?

04:53.919 --> 04:55.128
JESSE:
I just heard it. Guys,

04:55.128 --> 04:57.297
keep your heads out of the gutter, okay?
A Pound Day is when

04:57.297 --> 05:00.008
we both have a lot of work to do.
We lock ourselves in our apartment,

05:00.008 --> 05:01.510
we get a bunch of snacks, and we pound--

05:01.510 --> 05:02.636
- Each other!
Yeah!

05:02.636 --> 05:04.012
No!

05:04.012 --> 05:06.723
We pound out our work. We keep
each other from procrastinating.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.393
- Mm-hmm. Hannah's on me about
doing my wedding guest list.

05:09.393 --> 05:11.854
- And I'm finally gonna write
my first song as a solo artist,

05:11.854 --> 05:15.107
without Meredith,
and it's gonna be awesome! I mean...

05:15.858 --> 05:18.569
Sonny wrote a ton
of hits without Cher, I think.

05:18.569 --> 05:19.903
- Nope.

05:19.903 --> 05:23.365
He became the mayor of Palm Springs,
and then a congressman.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.034
He revolutionized
the United States copyright law.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.120
It's all in his memoir!

05:29.788 --> 05:32.332
- Hey, I know it's gotta feel like a lot

05:32.332 --> 05:35.043
to dive back into writing
songs without Meredith,

05:35.043 --> 05:36.503
but you got this.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.547
- Thanks.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.424
Just... hope I'm ready.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.009
- I know that you are.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.720
But, just in case...
- Yeah?

05:46.722 --> 05:48.807
- Take a good look bangle.
- Good luck bangle?

05:48.807 --> 05:51.602
- Yeah. I mean, just to help you
win your future Grammy,

05:51.602 --> 05:54.104
and if you do, then you have
to thank me in your speech.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.106
- Sure.
- Before your mom. And God.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.107
- Deal.

06:01.737 --> 06:05.240
- Alright! Time to get our
guest listing and songwriting on.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.242
- Woo! Let's pound, baby. Mm.

06:21.965 --> 06:25.219
Okay, I can't write songs with some bird
just creepily staring at me

06:25.219 --> 06:27.429
with its beady eyes and its pecky beak.

06:29.223 --> 06:32.226
Hey, shoo,
you good-for-nothing winged rat!

06:32.935 --> 06:35.854
Ah! Ah! He summoned a friend!

06:35.854 --> 06:38.482
- How do you make a bird
leave your windowsill?

06:38.482 --> 06:40.484
We tried to "shoo." It didn't work.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.903
- That's how you Google things?
- Yeah.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.240
- Jesse... Check this out.
- Yeah.

06:48.283 --> 06:51.161
- Bird makeup tutorial
- That is not at all helpful--

06:51.161 --> 06:52.955
Wow, she does all that
with just face paint?

06:52.955 --> 06:54.957
- Yeah, there's no way.
It's way too real.

06:54.957 --> 06:57.793
- Hi, fam. Wanna look like a bird?

06:57.793 --> 06:59.878
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.
This is an 18-minute video.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.880
We're supposed to be working.
- You're right.

07:03.966 --> 07:06.009
Just one minute.
- Yeah! We gotta see this.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.471
Just one minute, just one minute.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.265
- Ellen, I have horrible news.

07:11.807 --> 07:15.060
I have received a one-star
Yelp review. Ready?

07:15.060 --> 07:18.063
"Great bar, except for
the insufferable British guy.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.774
"The only thing worse than his drinks...

07:21.692 --> 07:23.819
is his flat butt."

07:23.819 --> 07:25.946
I mean, it's not true, is it?
Everybody knows

07:25.946 --> 07:27.781
I have a juicy bubble butt.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.867
- Dude, who cares? It's just Yelp.

07:29.867 --> 07:32.953
It's where white people go to complain
about how spicy Thai restaurants are.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.665
- I care, Ellen!
My pristine reputation is on the line!

07:37.541 --> 07:39.626
I must figure out who wrote
this dastardly review

07:39.626 --> 07:41.253
and get them to revise it.

07:41.253 --> 07:44.047
I will not sleep or eat,
until I have done so.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.592
- You just--
- I mean starting now.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.974
- Oh good, you're here.
These are all the guests

07:53.974 --> 07:55.559
with whom Rivka should be photographed.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.477
Start with titans of industry,

07:57.477 --> 07:59.646
followed by Tony Award winners,

07:59.646 --> 08:00.939
then Tony Award nominees,

08:00.939 --> 08:03.567
and if you get around to it,
friends and family.

08:04.193 --> 08:05.819
Oh! Here's Rivka.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.781
- Oh. My. God. You did not tell me

08:09.781 --> 08:11.783
this was Rivka Rebel's bat mitzvah.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.911
She has, like, a gazillion
followers on Instagram.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.245
- Oh.
- You know this pose?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.707
That was her. She did it first.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.587
- Rivka, meet your photographer, Sophie,

08:23.587 --> 08:25.422
and this is her assistant, Valentina.

08:25.422 --> 08:28.759
- Hey, Rivka. Mazel on your mitzvah.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.345
- Remember, you can contour a bad nose,

08:31.345 --> 08:33.514
but not a bad attitude.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.806
Find your light, Rebels!

08:34.806 --> 08:36.600
Rivka out.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.354
- And Sophie in!

08:40.354 --> 08:41.813
I would love to get a photo--

08:41.813 --> 08:44.066
- Sorry, I don't pose for amateurs.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.277
- Good luck.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.780
That's why our other
photographer dropped out.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.991
Oh, and watch out for Lin-Manuel Miranda.

08:52.991 --> 08:53.951
He loves to photobomb.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.376
CHARLIE:
Okay, who's the cruel Yelper?

09:03.752 --> 09:06.547
Sylvia. Oh my god, it's Sylvia!

09:06.547 --> 09:08.799
Well, she's totally
unaffected by my charm.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.093
Last week, I asked her
if she wanted a Charlie Special.

09:11.093 --> 09:11.885
- What's that?

09:11.885 --> 09:14.263
- Oh, it's a special drink
with a haiku written by me.

09:14.263 --> 09:15.055
- Oh...

09:15.055 --> 09:18.141
- But Sylvia says she doesn't appreciate
"amateur poetry." And look.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.354
The review was written by
RavenHairedMaven712.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.939
- Sylvia has jet-black hair.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.190
She's the maven!

09:25.983 --> 09:28.026
- Time to get her to re-Yelp.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.696
Ellen, prepare to see
a charm offensive. Ooh!

09:30.696 --> 09:32.865
Should we go "bright and cheery"
or "sexy voice"?

09:32.865 --> 09:33.949
- Bright and cheery.
- Not sexy--

09:33.949 --> 09:34.950
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

09:36.743 --> 09:40.038
Sylvia! Darling! Is that a new top?

09:40.372 --> 09:43.125
- I've had this top for over 40 years.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.502
But, you should probably change yours.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.462
It's very unflattering.

09:48.172 --> 09:49.173
- Right.

09:50.883 --> 09:52.885
- At least she didn't say anything
mean about your butt.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.180
- Should've done sexy voice.
- No.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.475
JESSE:
Ready? One, two, three.

10:01.602 --> 10:05.606
Wow! This is exactly what I'd look like
if I was a bird.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.232
And-and you look...

10:08.692 --> 10:10.736
Can I try again? I'm so sorry.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.696
- Hm...

10:12.696 --> 10:15.324
Nah. I'm like a late bloomer bird, right?

10:15.324 --> 10:18.410
Had some tough years in high school,
but I'm going into comedy.

10:19.995 --> 10:20.996
- Hm.

10:22.331 --> 10:25.000
- Okay. Time to get back to work, right?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.128
- Yep. Mm-hmm. Back to work.
- Back to work.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.507
- We can't not take pictures
first, though, right?

10:31.507 --> 10:33.800
- Okay. Let's go get our phones,
you beautiful bird genius!

10:39.556 --> 10:42.017
- Rivka. I just need
to get one picture of you

10:42.017 --> 10:44.228
in front of that neon sign,

10:44.228 --> 10:46.480
and then you can
live your hashtag best life.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.232
- Oh my god, Rebels.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.901
This photographer lady is tragic.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.906
- How am I supposed to crush
the bat mitzvah photos

10:55.906 --> 10:58.033
when the bat mitzvah girl
won't even acknowledge me?

10:58.033 --> 11:00.953
- She acknowledged you.
You're... tragic.

11:01.745 --> 11:05.082
Let me try to talk to her.
I'm in fashion, I speak teen.

11:05.082 --> 11:08.252
The trick is to mispronounce
things confidently.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.795
Wertch and lurnnn, gir'.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.342
What urrrrrp?

11:17.594 --> 11:20.639
- Not bad.
Oh, and neither are your boots.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.891
How did someone like you
get their old-ass feet

11:22.891 --> 11:25.269
into a pair of limited edition YSLs?

11:26.228 --> 11:28.146
- Well, I work for Fred Z right now,

11:28.146 --> 11:29.857
but my Instagram is blowing up,

11:29.857 --> 11:32.943
so designers are reaching out
to me directly.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.736
I could get you some great stuff.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.072
All you'd have to do
is take a selfie with me.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.700
- Hm. Hm. Yeah. No.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.580
- Hey, you're supposed to be helping me,

11:44.580 --> 11:46.415
not trying to get a selfie with her.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.876
- Sorry, sorry! I just thought a pic
with her would be great for my brand.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.795
You seem really tense. You want a Xanax?

11:51.795 --> 11:54.715
I picked some up for when we had
to go to Sid's improv show.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.926
- No. You know I can't do pills.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.012
The last time I took a Benadryl,
I emailed my cousin

12:00.012 --> 12:01.680
and told him I've always
wanted to kiss him.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.265
- Ew! Soph!

12:03.265 --> 12:05.434
- Whatever! He's an underwear model,

12:05.434 --> 12:07.477
and I see him, like, twice a year.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.480
- But you're animal control!
I mean, it's literally your job

12:10.480 --> 12:12.024
to come over here
and control these animals...

12:12.024 --> 12:14.568
Wow, I am a sexy bird.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.070
H-hello? He hung up.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.242
- Siri, Google "how to get rid of
trapped birds in your apartment."

12:22.618 --> 12:25.579
Oh, there's a new TikTok dance craze

12:25.579 --> 12:27.372
called the Trapped Bird.

12:27.372 --> 12:30.375
So, fam, you want to learn
how to do The Trapped Bird?

12:30.375 --> 12:33.045
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.
No more viral bird crazes, alright?

12:33.045 --> 12:35.631
We just gotta go in there,
put the snacks out on the fire escape,

12:35.631 --> 12:38.258
and then the birds will leave.
- Right 'cause birds love snacks.

12:38.759 --> 12:39.760
They're only human.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.888
Okay, ready?
- Yep.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.356
Ah! Ah! Ah! Fly!

12:53.524 --> 12:56.527
Follow your leaders,
you disgusting gutter flappers!

12:58.320 --> 12:59.947
- Oh!

13:02.699 --> 13:05.035
Okay, it's locked.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.122
LITTLE GIRL:
Mommy, look at those strange ladies.

13:10.165 --> 13:13.752
- We are not ladies!
We're two men in pigeon makeup!

13:19.132 --> 13:22.010
- Sylvia! How about a joke? Um...

13:22.010 --> 13:25.097
Why did the bartender
put laxatives in the drink?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.975
- You put laxatives in my drink?

13:27.975 --> 13:30.060
- No, of course not. It's just a joke.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.603
Why did the bartender put--

13:31.603 --> 13:33.397
Why did the bartender
put laxatives in the drink?

13:33.397 --> 13:35.274
For shits and giggles!
That's the punchline!

13:35.899 --> 13:38.902
- I hate prank comedy.
- Of course you do, Sylvia...

13:40.612 --> 13:43.073
- Well, that was a disaster
of epic proportions.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.074
- Yeah, I know.

13:44.825 --> 13:45.826
Wait a minute...

13:46.994 --> 13:49.329
"The British bartender's tight pants

13:49.329 --> 13:52.207
are a disaster of epic proportions..."

13:52.207 --> 13:56.128
- So, Sylvia and I use the same idioms.
That means less than nothing.

13:56.128 --> 13:58.463
- "His service skills are
less than nothing!" Ellen?

13:59.381 --> 14:01.008
Are you the Raven-Haired Maven?

14:01.008 --> 14:03.010
- No, I'm not!

14:03.760 --> 14:05.554
I don't even have...

14:05.554 --> 14:06.847
Oh hello, Yelp.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.225
I do not remember downloading you.

14:11.143 --> 14:13.020
Oh, right...

14:13.437 --> 14:15.814
- Alright. I'm off
to work the late shift.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.734
You know, it's not
just clocking in to a job.

14:18.734 --> 14:21.028
It is clocking in to a purpose.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.446
You should really try it. Hm.

14:28.202 --> 14:31.580
- After you left, I had way
more than my usual half martini,

14:31.580 --> 14:33.707
aka Tiny-Tini,

14:33.707 --> 14:35.459
and it must have gone to my head.

14:35.459 --> 14:38.462
:
You don't have a purpose, Ellen!

14:38.462 --> 14:40.714
You should get a job, Ellen!

14:42.466 --> 14:43.926
:
Guess what?

14:44.635 --> 14:46.637
Your butt's flat!

14:47.387 --> 14:49.556
- Ellen, why would you
write such horrible things?

14:50.182 --> 14:51.808
- I don't know.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.394
I mean, you have been kind of
throwing your new job in my face,

14:54.394 --> 14:57.314
and I guess...
I'm a little jealous of you.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.651
We both got to New York
at the exact same time,

15:00.651 --> 15:02.611
and you already have
a girlfriend that you love,

15:02.611 --> 15:04.530
and a job that you're great at.

15:04.530 --> 15:05.989
You're lapping me at everything.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.491
- Ellen, no.
- It's fine.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.746
Don't you dare watch me sad walk away!

15:14.706 --> 15:16.166
- So then, I was like,

15:16.166 --> 15:19.086
not going to happen, Kanye.
Not while you're with Kim."

15:20.546 --> 15:22.756
- Uh, Val? You're supposed
to be helping me.

15:22.756 --> 15:23.966
What the hell?

15:26.134 --> 15:27.845
- Okay, I know this looks bad,

15:27.845 --> 15:29.763
but I got her to tag me,

15:29.763 --> 15:32.099
and it already has 6,000 likes.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.976
Imagine what this will do for my brand.

15:33.976 --> 15:37.187
- Are you seriously still
talking to me about your brand?

15:37.646 --> 15:39.940
- Oh my god. It just hit me.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.984
Am I talking really fast?
I feel like I'm talking really fast.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.235
Let's twerk.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.614
- What's wrong with them?
- I don't know.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.659
They remind me of
my first time on Adderall.

15:50.659 --> 15:51.910
Oh no.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.789
So, they stole my tin of drugs.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.834
You seem really tense.
Do you want a Xanax?

16:01.336 --> 16:03.714
- Lose the purse.
- Oh.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.807
- What? What was in there?
- Not much!

16:13.807 --> 16:17.060
Just a Xanax I offered you.
And some Canadian Adderall.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.230
And some Ambien because I couldn't sleep
after I took all the Canadian Adderall.

16:31.283 --> 16:33.535
- God. High little children.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.371
Everyone, get in the corner
and... and huddle up!

16:38.457 --> 16:41.001
You know, none of this would have happened
if you hadn't been obsessed

16:41.001 --> 16:43.212
with getting your stupid
selfie with Rivka.

16:43.754 --> 16:46.048
You made today all about
you and your brand,

16:46.048 --> 16:47.716
even though you already
have an amazing job.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.927
- No, I don't.

16:49.927 --> 16:51.470
My job is a nightmare.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.055
- What are you talking about?

16:53.055 --> 16:56.350
Your job always sounds
so fancy and glamorous--

16:56.350 --> 16:58.435
- Because I make it sound that way.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.772
But the truth is glamorous
things happen around me,

17:01.772 --> 17:04.900
while I do menial grunt work
for a psychopathic stylist.

17:04.900 --> 17:08.654
Remember when I said I was going to spend
today accessorizing Timothée Chalamet?

17:08.654 --> 17:11.240
That was a lie. I was actually
supposed to get the pit stains

17:11.240 --> 17:14.535
out of my boss's suede jacket
before returning it to Balenciaga.

17:14.535 --> 17:17.246
And if they noticed the pit stains,
I was supposed to say...

17:17.246 --> 17:18.622
my pits did it.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.542
- Okay, that is so messed up.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.961
Also you have, like,
the least sweaty pits in New York.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.296
- I... know! I literally

17:26.296 --> 17:28.632
just drugged a group of kids,
and I'm dry as a bone.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.262
- We don't lie to each other, Val.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.390
It's part of our code,
along with our agreement

17:36.390 --> 17:39.184
to never speak about what happened
on Halloween 2018.

17:39.184 --> 17:41.144
SOPHIE'S SON: What happened--
- I'll never tell!

17:42.187 --> 17:44.147
- Why didn't you just tell me
your job sucked?

17:45.190 --> 17:46.567
- Because...

17:47.568 --> 17:50.821
you've always seen me
as this bad-ass boss bitch...

17:52.281 --> 17:53.907
I didn't want to pop that bubble.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.868
- You couldn't if you tried.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.911
- You still love me?

17:57.911 --> 17:59.496
- Yes, of course I do.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.375
- Wait a minute.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.213
They took my other tin.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.631
- Huh?

18:09.631 --> 18:12.342
- The wintergreen tin
has all the good stuff.

18:12.342 --> 18:15.888
The red tin is just
ibuprofen and probiotics.

18:17.598 --> 18:19.183
- Okay, wait. So, you're saying--

18:19.183 --> 18:21.268
- The placebo effect is real!

18:21.268 --> 18:24.354
These nerds are just headache
and bloat-free with good gut health.

18:27.733 --> 18:29.860
- Hey, dorks, you're all on--

18:29.860 --> 18:32.988
- Super intense, very hard illegal drugs.

18:32.988 --> 18:36.158
So, unless you want us to tell your
parents you're, uh, smack heads,

18:36.158 --> 18:37.701
you're gonna go back out there

18:37.701 --> 18:39.161
and act sober.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.664
- You wouldn't really
tell my mom, would you?

18:42.664 --> 18:45.459
She said she'd limit my screen time
if she ever caught me with drugs.

18:45.459 --> 18:48.670
My whole life is screen time.
She's going to limit my life!

18:49.338 --> 18:50.714
- Oh. Well then,

18:50.714 --> 18:53.509
you better get in there
and give me every shot I need.

18:53.509 --> 18:55.719
When I say smile, you say how hard.

18:55.719 --> 18:58.055
And I'm talking about real smiles.

18:58.055 --> 19:01.099
None of those dead-eyed
Generation Z smiles. You got it?

19:01.099 --> 19:02.226
- Yes, ma'am.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.354
- That's more like it.
But do not call her ma'am.

19:05.354 --> 19:06.855
We are not that old.
- Correct.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.815
Out you go. Go on.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.818
- Dude, what's wrong with us?

19:11.818 --> 19:14.238
We should be in there
pounding out our tasks,

19:14.238 --> 19:15.822
and instead,
we're trapped out here...

19:16.490 --> 19:18.408
being birds.

19:19.159 --> 19:22.287
- Yeah. I don't know, man,
today just felt kind of tough.

19:23.205 --> 19:26.250
Jesse, I'm really struggling
with this guest list, man.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.085
Like, I really just...
I wanna invite people

19:28.085 --> 19:30.587
that are, like, super close to me,
you know?

19:30.587 --> 19:33.048
And so many of those people
are back in New Delhi.

19:35.384 --> 19:38.387
I've been thinking for a long time
that I wanted to have two weddings.

19:38.387 --> 19:40.681
One here, one in India,

19:40.681 --> 19:43.392
but Hannah, she's already killing herself

19:43.392 --> 19:45.060
trying to plan one wedding

19:45.060 --> 19:47.688
and I don't want to
overwhelm her and stuff, you know?

19:50.732 --> 19:52.818
Are you seriously
laughing at me right now?

19:52.818 --> 19:54.152
- I'm sorry! You're just...

19:54.152 --> 19:56.613
You're, like, this hideous bird
who wants two weddings!

19:59.575 --> 20:01.869
I couldn't focus today, either.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.747
Sophie called it. I'm scared I'll never
write anything good without Meredith.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.875
- Of course you will, man.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.751
You just need new inspiration.

20:10.085 --> 20:13.088
- Hello? Anybody home? Super let me in!

20:13.088 --> 20:14.798
SID:
Oh, thank God. Animal control.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.009
- Wait!

20:17.009 --> 20:20.012
It this, like, a sex thing?
You won't believe how many times it is.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.519
- Knock, knock.

20:30.522 --> 20:33.942
- You don't have to mouth-knock.
I don't deserve that courtesy.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.653
- 'Course you do. Look, Ellen, I...

20:38.071 --> 20:41.658
I'm sorry that I was throwing
my new job in your face.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.076
You know, it wasn't fair.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.414
But it's okay that you're still
finding your footing here.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.752
'Cause I thought you should know
that you are already getting rave reviews.

20:51.752 --> 20:54.338
- Oh no. Are you doing a thing?

20:54.880 --> 20:58.425
You look extremely pleased with yourself.
- What on Earth is this?

20:58.425 --> 21:01.720
A new Yelp review for Ellen Gibson? Well,

21:01.720 --> 21:05.265
let's see what BritishBubbleButt31
has to say about you.

21:06.934 --> 21:10.270
- "Ellen Gibson has only been
in New York for a little while,

21:10.270 --> 21:13.273
"but she's already the most interesting,

21:13.273 --> 21:15.776
beautiful, and loyal friend
I've ever had."

21:17.319 --> 21:20.489
Charlie...
- I know. I outdid myself.

21:21.323 --> 21:24.326
- "She's also the most giving woman
I've ever shared a room with.

21:24.868 --> 21:28.372
Just nonstop giving all the time."

21:29.498 --> 21:30.832
Charlie, this sounds like I just...

21:31.834 --> 21:33.210
Is that my actual number?!

21:38.966 --> 21:40.217
Hello?

21:40.217 --> 21:42.261
CREEPY MAN :
I hear you're real giving...

21:45.389 --> 21:48.350
- So, we need to have another
talk about internet safety.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.271
- Great! Okay, Rivka. Now,

21:52.271 --> 21:55.399
let's get one with your
Hebrew school teacher, mid-jump.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.734
- Ugh. Fine.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.736
Just don't tag me, Jacob.

22:02.447 --> 22:03.824
NAOMI:
Well!

22:03.824 --> 22:05.659
I'm impressed.

22:05.659 --> 22:08.787
And I haven't been impressed
since Cirque du Soleil "Mystere."

22:09.538 --> 22:10.622
A deal's a deal.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.875
Send your absolute best photo to Amber,

22:12.875 --> 22:15.961
the one that sums up
who you are as an artist,

22:15.961 --> 22:19.631
and I'll consider squeezing you
into our New Voices show.

22:20.465 --> 22:22.718
- I know just the one I'm going to send.

22:22.718 --> 22:24.136
Thank you, Naomi.

22:24.136 --> 22:25.971
Thank you. I'll get it to you ASAP.

22:25.971 --> 22:27.181
- Wonderful. Valentina.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.020
- Oh my god, Sophie, it's happening!

22:33.020 --> 22:34.688
- I know! I know!

22:34.688 --> 22:37.149
- So what photo are you gonna send?
- I don't know, I don't know!

22:38.233 --> 22:39.568
I gotta take the perfect shot.

22:39.860 --> 22:43.739
- So, Aunt Valentina didn't
actually drug a bunch of tweens,

22:43.739 --> 22:47.242
and I didn't tank my first
life-changing opportunity.

22:48.202 --> 22:50.537
But now, I needed inspiration to strike.

22:50.537 --> 22:54.333
Something someone else was struggling
with at the exact same time.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.296
- Hey, Jesse.
- Yeah?

22:59.296 --> 23:00.380
- I talked to Hannah.

23:01.131 --> 23:02.716
She gets it. Okay,

23:02.716 --> 23:05.928
do you know how fine
she's gonna look in a sari?

23:05.928 --> 23:08.931
- Hey, man, I'm happy for you.
That you're with a girl that gets it.
