WEBVTT

00:10.098 --> 00:13.185
In nature, everything is connected.

00:13.393 --> 00:17.189
As scientists, we explore
and expand upon those connections...

00:17.397 --> 00:19.691
...to the benefit of society.

00:19.900 --> 00:24.404
We're experimenting with genetically
altered electric rays and eels.

00:26.281 --> 00:29.826
Think what it would mean if we
could harness this bioelectricity...

00:30.035 --> 00:34.414
...generate an alternate form of energy:
a new, clean source of power.

00:34.623 --> 00:38.377
It sounds great,
but you might wanna clean the tank.

00:39.002 --> 00:41.505
It's clean. The fluid-- I call it sludge.

00:41.713 --> 00:44.174
--Increases the eels'
bioelectric signatures.

00:44.383 --> 00:47.928
Yes. In fact, those very signatures
have become so intense...

00:48.136 --> 00:51.306
...we've been forced to upgrade
the lab's bioelectrical filters.

00:51.515 --> 00:54.685
- We've been forced?
- I stand corrected.

00:54.893 --> 00:58.063
- We're forcing Max, here, to upgrade.
- All I'm saying.

00:58.272 --> 01:02.651
- Curt, I need to get Billy to bed.
- Sorry, honey. I lost track of time.

01:02.859 --> 01:05.988
You? No. I'm shocked.

01:06.196 --> 01:09.908
I have to wait for Max to finish,
but you go ahead, take Billy home.

01:10.117 --> 01:11.827
You might send Peter
and Gwen home.

01:12.035 --> 01:15.289
- It is a school night, doc.
- Right, right, right.

01:15.747 --> 01:17.541
Go on, you two.

01:24.881 --> 01:30.304
It's my Aunt May early-warning system.
I have to call if I'm not home by 10.

01:30.512 --> 01:33.849
Hey, Aunt May. Sorry for running late.
We just left the lab.

01:34.057 --> 01:37.561
I'm gonna make sure Gwen gets home
safe, and then I'm on my way.

02:00.459 --> 02:02.461
Come on.

03:23.166 --> 03:24.668
How's his pul--?

03:24.876 --> 03:26.670
- Put these on.
- I don't understand.

03:26.878 --> 03:29.339
There was an accident.
We need to quarantine him...

03:29.548 --> 03:32.718
...get his vitals stabilized.
He's getting worse by the minute.

03:33.719 --> 03:37.013
All right.
Take him to the Isolation Ward, stat.

03:57.075 --> 03:58.744
I could be in real trouble here.

04:14.176 --> 04:17.387
I'm not even sure my spider-powers
can save me this time.

04:25.061 --> 04:28.398
You know, just once,
I'd like to be early for school.

04:40.994 --> 04:42.704
"Spider-Man in action."

04:42.913 --> 04:45.290
- It's not what you think.
- It is too, dufus.

04:45.499 --> 04:46.583
Says so right here.

04:46.792 --> 04:48.919
The <i>Daily Bugle</i>
is offering major fundage...

04:49.127 --> 04:51.922
...for a photo of Spider-Man in action.

04:52.964 --> 04:54.966
Then it is what you think.

04:55.801 --> 04:58.220
Hey, wait. That was my idea.

04:58.428 --> 05:02.557
- Looking foolish in biology class?
- No. The spider-picture thing.

05:02.766 --> 05:06.311
- I told that bigmouthed <i>Bugle</i> guy to--
- Take photos of someone famous?

05:06.520 --> 05:09.064
Yeah, that is revolutionary.

05:09.272 --> 05:11.107
All right, class, settle down.

05:11.316 --> 05:15.987
I know you're all eager
to get yesterday's test back.

05:17.155 --> 05:19.282
C-minus? Sweet.

05:19.491 --> 05:22.285
The Flash completes another pass.

05:25.831 --> 05:29.000
Nice job, Mr. Parker. Another A-plus.

05:36.758 --> 05:38.260
Mr. Thompson.

05:48.854 --> 05:51.064
Dr. Bromwell, how's Max?

05:52.023 --> 05:54.359
Alive. And that's a miracle,
believe me.

05:54.568 --> 05:58.321
- His condition is stabilized, but--
- Maybe he should just see for himself.

06:00.866 --> 06:01.908
Hey, Eddie.

06:02.117 --> 06:06.121
Max's body is currently generating
a constant stream of bioelectricity.

06:06.329 --> 06:11.376
That insulation suit will contain it,
protect him and everyone.

06:12.669 --> 06:15.881
But, Max, I promise you,
it's only temporary.

06:16.089 --> 06:18.091
We'll begin work on a cure
immediately.

06:18.925 --> 06:20.802
Least you can do.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.598
Try to rest.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.359
Ms. Allan, a moment, please.

06:38.111 --> 06:41.656
Liz, if you're gonna raise that grade,
you need a tutor.

06:41.865 --> 06:44.701
And I'm recommending Peter
for the job.

06:45.410 --> 06:48.371
Nerd is so not the hot accessory
this year.

06:48.580 --> 06:51.249
Quality time with Puny Parker?
I'd rather fail.

06:51.458 --> 06:55.086
Study with Petey? I don't think so.

06:55.879 --> 06:57.756
Couldn't Flash tutor me instead?

06:59.925 --> 07:04.596
I'm not sure you understand.
We want your grade to go up.

07:17.442 --> 07:18.902
I can't even watch the game.

07:19.110 --> 07:23.031
Yeah, but you can still yell at the TV.
So really, hey, what's changed, right?

07:23.239 --> 07:24.908
That supposed to be funny?

07:26.284 --> 07:28.703
You know I had plans
before this happened.

07:28.912 --> 07:31.247
Go back to college, meet someone,
have a life.

07:31.456 --> 07:34.960
Dude, chill. You have to
give yourself time to adjust.

07:35.168 --> 07:37.629
Adjust to what, this?

07:46.429 --> 07:47.889
I'm out of here.

07:48.765 --> 07:50.767
Max, wait.

07:54.145 --> 07:58.108
See, the chapter's really about
how biological systems interact.

07:58.608 --> 08:01.945
Anything in there about how
biological systems are boring?

08:02.153 --> 08:04.072
Yeah, dullsville, right?

08:04.280 --> 08:06.700
Hey, who wants to waste their time
with a textbook?

08:06.908 --> 08:08.118
What a coincidence.

08:08.326 --> 08:11.454
Flash just texted me
those exact words...

08:11.663 --> 08:13.456
...about you, Petey.

08:13.665 --> 08:16.751
Maybe if you stopped texting Flash
forjust a minute--

08:16.960 --> 08:19.921
Good idea. I'll call him instead.

08:27.220 --> 08:28.638
Daddy, what's he wearing?

08:31.683 --> 08:32.976
And what are you staring at?

08:33.183 --> 08:35.937
- I was just waiting for your order.
- Coffee.

08:41.693 --> 08:45.989
Oh, man. I can't even drink
a lousy cup of coffee.

08:50.702 --> 08:53.163
Sorry. I'm sorry.

08:53.371 --> 08:56.833
Oh, yeah, I'll be fluent in geek.

08:59.169 --> 09:03.256
<i>Thug alert. And just when I was having
so much fun being ignored.</i>

09:03.465 --> 09:05.800
This tutoring thing
is something you need, not me.

09:06.009 --> 09:08.261
So when you're ready to learn,
let me know.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.973
<i>Liz? Can you hear me? Liz?</i>

09:26.905 --> 09:28.907
Someone's getting paid
for Spidey's picture.

09:29.115 --> 09:30.825
Might as well be me.

09:31.034 --> 09:34.287
Okay, self-portraits
aren't going to be as easy as I thought.

09:34.496 --> 09:36.331
What I need is a group shot.

09:36.539 --> 09:39.250
- Move, move.
- Look out.

09:40.418 --> 09:41.795
Just leave me alone.

09:43.505 --> 09:44.547
Hey, SPF-

09:44.756 --> 09:48.510
Say, "Spider-Man." Wonderful.
You are a very cooperative crook.

09:48.718 --> 09:52.597
But I can't get a good mug shot
if you're wearing this.

09:59.104 --> 10:00.563
You shouldn't have done that.

10:02.148 --> 10:06.111
You really shouldn't have done that.

10:18.581 --> 10:20.834
Why did you attack me?

10:21.960 --> 10:24.921
Now, now.
"Attack" is such a strong word.

10:25.130 --> 10:26.631
What's your game?

10:30.468 --> 10:31.761
All right, Electro.

10:32.929 --> 10:35.140
Time to unplug.

10:36.599 --> 10:39.853
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!

10:49.112 --> 10:51.072
You should have left me alone.

10:59.122 --> 11:00.415
Perfect.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.756
- Hello?
- Hey, Aunt May.

11:08.965 --> 11:10.884
<i>- Peter, it's almost 10.
- Yeah,</i> I <i>know.</i>

11:11.092 --> 11:14.304
That's why I'm calling.
I've been tutoring.

11:16.139 --> 11:18.433
It's slow going,
but I'll be home soon.

11:18.641 --> 11:20.977
<i>I hope so.
The weatherman predicted rain.</i>

11:21.186 --> 11:23.104
<i>You don't have your umbrella.</i>

11:23.313 --> 11:25.607
Yeah, somehow,
I doubt an umbrella would help.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.276
I mean, it's not raining here yet.

11:32.906 --> 11:35.491
Okay, bye, Aunt May. Don't wait up.

11:37.202 --> 11:38.912
All right, Electro, I'm--

11:40.330 --> 11:42.415
--all alone.

11:50.173 --> 11:52.467
<i>Blurry. Blurry.</i>

11:52.675 --> 11:56.012
<i>Oh, nice one of my elbow.
Or my knee, maybe.</i>

11:56.221 --> 11:59.933
<i>And this one would've been great
if my arm was 2 feet longer.</i>

12:00.516 --> 12:02.518
<i>No way the</i> Bugle
<i>will take any of these.</i>

12:02.727 --> 12:04.646
<i>Not only does Lightning-Butt
get away...</i>

12:04.854 --> 12:06.814
<i>-...but I've got nothing to show--
- Peter.</i>

12:07.023 --> 12:10.443
I just talked to Eddie.
There was an accident at the lab.

12:11.027 --> 12:12.487
<i>Max's life is trashed.</i>

12:12.695 --> 12:15.490
<i>And not only don't I recognize him,
I attack him.</i>

12:16.032 --> 12:19.702
<i>Not sure if I could've helped,
but at least I could've tried.</i>

12:21.246 --> 12:23.331
- Petey.
- Yeah, Petey.

12:23.539 --> 12:25.667
Look, I feel bad
for ditching you last night.

12:25.875 --> 12:29.629
So if you still want help, we can meet
after school at the ESU lab.

12:29.837 --> 12:31.547
It's up to you.

12:41.182 --> 12:42.558
Could we put him in a tank?

12:42.767 --> 12:46.062
- Use a bioelectric filter to siphon--?
- No. Won't work, I'm afraid.

12:46.271 --> 12:49.399
Eels evolved to exist
in aquatic environments. Max didn't.

12:49.607 --> 12:51.776
With the voltage
he's currently generating...

12:51.985 --> 12:53.987
...you don't want him
anywhere near water.

12:54.195 --> 12:55.863
Petey?

12:59.867 --> 13:01.286
Petey?

13:03.496 --> 13:05.707
Max, we need to get you back
to the hospital.

13:05.915 --> 13:08.543
Done with hospitals.
Just wanna go home.

13:08.751 --> 13:11.045
- I'm not sure you're ready for--
- Listen, Dillon.

13:11.254 --> 13:14.716
After last night's blowout,
it's either a hospital room or a jail cell.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.217
- Your call.
- My call?

13:16.426 --> 13:20.763
My call?
None of this has been my call!

13:24.100 --> 13:28.062
- Max, stop. We just wanna help you.
- You can't help me.

13:28.271 --> 13:31.274
But I know who can.

13:38.614 --> 13:41.409
- Maybe this isn't such a good time.
- No, go on.

13:41.617 --> 13:44.662
I need to check some results
in my office anyway.

13:49.125 --> 13:53.588
So, Eddie,
you quarterbacking for ESU?

13:53.796 --> 13:56.090
No. Hung up my jersey
back at Midtown.

13:56.299 --> 13:59.093
- I'm strictly a nerd now.
- We're all nerds here.

13:59.302 --> 14:01.554
- You can be too.
- Wonderful.

14:01.763 --> 14:06.476
I'm serious, Liz. You're smart.
You can get this stuff.

14:08.811 --> 14:11.814
You just need to look at it
in a new way.

14:12.482 --> 14:15.943
- Petey.
- In nature, everything's connected.

14:16.152 --> 14:19.989
As scientists, we explore
and expand upon those connections.

14:20.198 --> 14:21.783
As people, we should do the same.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.869
Thought you said
this stuff was boring.

14:25.828 --> 14:28.956
You're lucky to have Pete as a tutor,
Liz. Guy knows his stuff.

14:29.165 --> 14:31.793
Probably a Nobel Prize in his future.

14:37.715 --> 14:40.968
I have the results of--
Curt, what are you doing?

14:42.345 --> 14:45.139
It's nothing. I can explain.

14:45.348 --> 14:47.767
- What is that?
- An experimental bio-formula.

14:47.975 --> 14:50.395
- Genetically altered lizard DNA.
- What?

14:57.568 --> 14:59.654
Connors!

15:00.363 --> 15:01.572
Where's Connors?

15:04.200 --> 15:06.452
You really don't wanna
keep me waiting, kids.

15:06.661 --> 15:10.498
- Where's Connors?
- Max, I'm right here. Try to stay calm.

15:10.706 --> 15:14.085
Calm? We left calm behind
a lifetime ago, doc.

15:14.293 --> 15:16.754
I can't take it anymore.

15:16.963 --> 15:19.882
You caused this, you cure it.

15:20.091 --> 15:23.469
We're working on that, Max, I promise.
It'll just take time.

15:23.678 --> 15:26.806
I don't have time.

15:27.014 --> 15:29.600
Cure me now...

15:31.853 --> 15:36.190
...before I really get upset.

15:41.779 --> 15:44.824
I know you can do it, doc.

15:45.324 --> 15:48.619
All you need
is the proper motivation.

15:48.828 --> 15:51.706
<i>Oh, well. The secret-identity thing
was fun while it lasted.</i>

15:51.914 --> 15:55.001
<i>- I'll</i> distract him. You get the girls out.
- What? Eddie, no.

16:03.009 --> 16:04.802
Come on.

16:05.011 --> 16:06.679
In there. It'll be safe.

16:08.347 --> 16:11.517
- Police Emergency? There's a--
- Gwen. Gwen, wait.

16:11.726 --> 16:13.186
Where's Petey?

16:15.188 --> 16:19.650
Max, please, don't hurt him.
We'll find a cure. We just need time.

16:19.859 --> 16:21.861
You're lying.

16:26.699 --> 16:29.994
Guys, I know it's not exactly a cure,
but how about some chill pills?

16:30.203 --> 16:31.746
YQU!

16:32.246 --> 16:34.373
Yeah, me. Look, I messed up before.

16:34.582 --> 16:37.543
- But now I really wanna help.
- You wanna hold my hand?

16:41.047 --> 16:42.381
None of you get it.

16:42.590 --> 16:46.677
Without a cure,
I'm not Max Dillon. I'm--

16:46.886 --> 16:48.513
What'd you call me?

16:48.721 --> 16:51.682
- Lighting-Butt?
- No, not that.

16:51.891 --> 16:53.559
Electro.

16:53.768 --> 16:55.186
Yeah.

16:55.394 --> 16:58.397
I'm Electro.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.540
All right, Electro,
you wanna vent, then vent.

17:43.568 --> 17:48.781
Gone. My only chance at a cure,
and you let them escape.

17:57.456 --> 18:01.168
That's it. The gloves are off.

18:11.971 --> 18:14.807
That <i>Bugle</i> prize money's
as good as mine.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.812
If Spider-Man would just stand still.

18:25.276 --> 18:27.236
Sorry, photo shoot's over.

18:27.445 --> 18:29.822
But if those shots come out,
I want my cut.

18:32.575 --> 18:34.493
Okay, Electro, the gloves are on.

18:47.131 --> 18:49.675
See? You can dish it out,
but you can't--

18:55.473 --> 18:57.516
Oh, me and my big spider-mouth.

18:59.185 --> 19:04.231
Can't escape me up there, web-slinger.
This is my playground.

19:15.326 --> 19:19.205
Okay, maybe climbing a big
metal tower wasn't the brightest idea.

19:20.706 --> 19:24.168
Oh, man, where does the time go?

19:24.418 --> 19:26.003
- Hello?
- Hi, Aunt May.

19:26.212 --> 19:27.338
<i>Peter, where are you?</i>

19:27.546 --> 19:31.050
<i>You sound strange,
and there's so much static.</i>

19:32.551 --> 19:34.387
Yeah, it's a bad connection.

19:35.721 --> 19:37.348
I'm running late again, but--

19:37.556 --> 19:40.184
<i>Peter, you're taking advantage
of our arrangement.</i>

19:40.393 --> 19:43.521
<i>Calling in late every night
is not acceptable.</i>

19:43.729 --> 19:46.649
Sorry, I can't hear you. Static.
I'll be home soon. Bye.

19:46.857 --> 19:48.484
I am so grounded.

19:48.693 --> 19:51.946
Of course, being grounded right now
might not be such a bad thing.

20:00.871 --> 20:03.290
What I really need is a plan.

20:11.424 --> 20:13.217
Or the world's biggest dunk-tank.

20:54.467 --> 20:57.386
Petey,
what were you thinking last night?

20:57.595 --> 21:00.306
- That I should try to help?
- And did you?

21:00.514 --> 21:03.100
Me? No.

21:03.309 --> 21:07.271
- Old Petey's pretty useless, I guess.
- I wouldn't say that.

21:08.814 --> 21:11.859
Hey, what's Puny Parker doing here?

21:15.279 --> 21:17.490
Leaving, I hope.

21:29.919 --> 21:30.961
Peter Parker:

21:31.170 --> 21:35.966
another hapless victim of the wild,
undomesticated cheerleader.

21:38.093 --> 21:39.136
It's her loss, Pete.

21:39.345 --> 21:41.472
And, hey,
if the job was to help her learn...

21:41.680 --> 21:45.184
...at least you taught her
how to fold to peer pressure.

21:46.185 --> 21:49.980
No big. I reached out,
and she knocked my hand away.

21:50.189 --> 21:54.693
You can't control everything.
Trick is to never stop trying.

22:04.370 --> 22:09.166
We won't stop trying, Curt,
but we can't do anything more today.

22:09.375 --> 22:12.545
Come on. Let's go home.
