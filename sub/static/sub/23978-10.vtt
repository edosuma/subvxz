02:40.076 --> 02:43.496
Hey, Mom.
Are they treating you okay?

02:44.038 --> 02:45.415
Have a seat.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.126
You must be Officer Dale Holiday.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.502
Yes, ma'am. Head of security.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.589
I'll be handling all arrangements
for the inmate while she's here.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.007
The inmate has a name.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.135
- Respectfully, you're free to use it.
- I wanna confer with my client.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.029
- I'll need you to clear the room.
- No can do.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.805
We need weapons
on the inmate at all times.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.432
Oh, come on, this is overkill.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.393
Miss Jones has a constitutional right
to attorney-client privilege.

03:05.476 --> 03:06.603
Her powers nullify that.

03:06.686 --> 03:07.830
- Says who?
- Jessica, please.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.522
This is bullshit. Where's your boss?

03:09.606 --> 03:11.316
She'll tell you
the same thing she told me.

03:11.399 --> 03:14.444
These are special circumstances,
so we're on special protocol.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.655
If you need privacy,
I suggest you keep your voices down.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.707
I'm your attorney,

03:29.083 --> 03:30.168
Jeri Hogarth.

03:30.752 --> 03:34.464
Obviously,
you're in a very difficult position,

03:34.547 --> 03:37.175
but there is an opportunity for you
to improve your situation.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.803
You just need to agree
to certain stipulations.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.642
Excuse me.
Which camera?

03:45.725 --> 03:48.311
This is just a trial run,
Trish, so be yourself.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.813
Give us three good minutes
to cut into a sizzle.

03:50.897 --> 03:55.109
- Ron, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me. You're gonna kill it.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.778
Rolling! Rolling!

03:56.861 --> 03:58.488
- Clear the set!
- I'm ready.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.490
I'm trying to get
some color into her.

04:00.573 --> 04:04.077
In five, four, three...

04:06.621 --> 04:09.499
It's a great deal.
And you wouldn't have to go to The Raft.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.960
And just so we're clear,
The Raft is completely remote.

04:12.043 --> 04:15.463
No visitors. You'd be
in solitary confinement 23 hours a day.

04:15.546 --> 04:19.175
But if you take the deal,
you can stay here.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.517
Mom...

04:28.101 --> 04:29.894
You'd have all your needs met.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.064
The tranquilizers, the restraints,
your special bed

04:33.147 --> 04:34.941
would all be transferred here
to the prison.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.693
I'm assuming you wear a wig?

04:37.318 --> 04:38.569
I'll add it to the list.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.614
Our biggest get is visitation.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.451
You can have a relationship
with your daughter.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.122
You'd be locked up for life,
but it would be a humane life.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.460
In exchange for a full confession?

04:55.420 --> 04:58.381
You have to tell them everything you know,

04:58.464 --> 05:01.467
including everything about Karl
and where they can find him.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.178
This is coming from people
far above the DA's office.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.638
They want the man who made you.

05:06.431 --> 05:10.226
If they want the person responsible
for who I am, they already have her.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.061
I won't give him up.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.731
So you know where he is?

05:17.108 --> 05:20.528
As Americans, we account
for 5% of the world's population,

05:20.611 --> 05:22.363
and yet, we make up 20...

05:23.614 --> 05:27.201
almost 25%
of the world's prison population.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.663
It started with our war on drugs.

05:30.747 --> 05:34.542
But instead of getting people help,
we... we locked them up.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.629
- Black people, poor people, women...
- Don't feel tied to your notes.

05:38.713 --> 05:41.841
Just give it to me like you did
when you quit Trish Talk.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.721
- Okay. Maybe if I stand.
- Yeah, sure.

05:47.972 --> 05:48.973
Okay.

05:51.809 --> 05:55.605
The number of women sent to prison
has shot up by almost 800%.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.440
- We have better choices.
- Why?

05:57.523 --> 06:01.110
Why? Because mass, uh...

06:01.861 --> 06:05.281
mass incarceration has become
America's latest addiction...

06:05.364 --> 06:08.159
I'm sorry.
Can I get some water, please?

06:08.242 --> 06:10.369
Water? Water, please?

06:10.453 --> 06:11.788
Take a moment.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.042
Okay, here you go.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.126
Thank you.

06:18.544 --> 06:22.465
Is this what you want to talk about?
Or is this what you think we want to hear?

06:22.548 --> 06:25.635
- Well, it's important to a lot of people.
- What's important to you?

06:26.552 --> 06:30.223
You wanna talk about addiction? Great.
Talk about Trish Walker and addiction.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.241
Well, I don't know
what that has to do...

06:33.267 --> 06:37.897
Your history with drug use has been
tabloid fodder for years. Use it.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.858
We got ten Barbies with microphones
on this network.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.223
- I'm not a damn Barbie.
- Okay. Then show me who you are.

06:43.277 --> 06:47.198
Smack me in the face with your truth.
Okay? What makes you so special?

06:48.908 --> 06:50.034
I think we're back.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.702
Look at me.

06:58.251 --> 07:02.755
I almost put your face through the floor.
Where's your sense of self-preservation?

07:02.839 --> 07:05.883
- You're still my mother.
- No, I just have her voice.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.343
Karl is all I've got.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.178
Then you're a goddamn idiot.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.475
The deal goes away tomorrow morning.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.563
But I can try to buy more time
for you to make up your mind.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.690
I already have.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.861
Just get it off me.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.077
Hey. Stick around, will ya?

07:33.703 --> 07:36.205
I got a lead
on that female murder suspect.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.498
She's powered.

07:37.582 --> 07:38.582
No shit.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.835
Padma, I want everyone on this.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.588
Stringers at the 15th, the DA's office...

07:49.469 --> 07:52.013
- She didn't even consider it.
- Convince her.

07:52.096 --> 07:55.600
How? She'd rather live in a hole
than even look at me.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.352
Get creative. The transfer
will be processed in the morning.

07:59.687 --> 08:00.688
Coming?

08:01.647 --> 08:03.900
- I'm walking.
- All right, talk later.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.946
Trish? Are you okay?

08:09.530 --> 08:12.909
- Is it the killer? You get her?
- Screw that. Where are you?

08:14.243 --> 08:18.289
You're right, I lied.
I... I fell way off the wagon.

08:18.372 --> 08:21.417
But I am painfully, miserably sober now.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.294
I can be there for you if you need help.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.338
I just need to know
if you caught the killer.

08:26.714 --> 08:27.715
Yeah.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.509
I knew it had to be you.

08:29.592 --> 08:33.596
Okay. Listen, I just left ZCN.
Somebody tipped them off about the arrest.

08:34.138 --> 08:37.683
But to hell with them.
They're not scooping our story. No way.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.852
Just meet me at Alias, okay?

08:43.813 --> 08:48.069
The moral of my shitty story is,
if your dead parent comes back to life,

08:48.152 --> 08:50.029
stick 'em back in the ground.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.910
So that woman was your mother?

08:59.539 --> 09:00.414
Is.

09:00.498 --> 09:04.835
And you kept her here for two days
and didn't tell anyone?

09:04.919 --> 09:07.046
It can't be easy for Jess.
She lost her whole family.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.249
You don't have to defend me.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.466
No, you know what else isn't easy?

09:10.550 --> 09:13.553
Giving a crap about you
when you consistently lie to me.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.971
I wanted to keep you out of it.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.890
I work here, okay?
I pretty much live here.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.334
What do I have to do
to prove to you that I can handle shit?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.061
- Mal, calm down.
- "Mal"?

09:22.144 --> 09:24.564
And you? I mean,
why don't you get honest with her

09:24.647 --> 09:26.566
and tell her about that shit
you've been taking?

09:26.649 --> 09:29.402
I'm so sick of being
the only one who's for real around here.

09:36.701 --> 09:37.868
You slept with him.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.664
We actually have a lot in common.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.877
So, what are you taking?

09:48.170 --> 09:50.047
Simpson's inhaler.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.925
You have no idea what's in that shit.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.136
It could kill you.
It could melt your insides.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.930
Just skip the lecture. I'm drying out.
The thing's empty, okay?

09:58.014 --> 09:59.932
Why even risk it in the first place?

10:00.641 --> 10:01.642
I don't know.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.563
It felt like more of a risk not
to take it.

10:05.646 --> 10:11.235
You single-handedly almost took down IGH
with a Patsy wig and a cell phone.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.321
How much more of a badass
do you need to be?

10:13.404 --> 10:14.739
You know the answer to that.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.410
I won't do this story.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.289
Not with your mom involved.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.834
You don't deserve the blowback.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.589
What about Karl?

10:37.386 --> 10:38.763
You know, I'm not the best person

10:38.846 --> 10:41.265
for a recovering addict
to be around right now.

10:52.735 --> 10:53.819
Call me later.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.053
Hey.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.767
- I was worried. You just took off...
- About me? Really?

11:25.518 --> 11:27.311
Or about what I would tell Jessica?

11:29.480 --> 11:30.648
I deserve that.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.943
All these months working on my shit,
rebuilding some kind of life.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.821
And then one night with you,
and I'm ready to throw it all away.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.739
I'm sorry. I was strung out.

11:38.823 --> 11:43.327
You didn't make me take that shit, okay?
That was all me.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.998
I mean, I still want you.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.918
Maybe because you're bad for me, but...

11:52.628 --> 11:54.880
Yeah, there it is. So I can't do this.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.298
I'm clean now.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.927
Yeah, but there's a hole in your soul.

12:01.595 --> 12:06.142
Just like there's a hole in mine, and...
So let's not use each other to fill it.

12:07.726 --> 12:10.604
We're still friends, right?

12:12.189 --> 12:13.441
I don't think so.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.782
She's gone.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.952
I know.
Uh, I saw them take her away.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.788
- Did Vido?
- No. He was with his abuela.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.499
He didn't see anything.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.583
Good.

13:13.292 --> 13:17.588
You know, the time I spent inside...
it wasn't easy, I'm not gonna lie.

13:18.672 --> 13:22.009
But the first Saturday of every month,
I got to see Vido.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.554
Wasn't perfect, but...
to me, it was everything.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.060
Your mother did some bad things...

13:32.436 --> 13:34.939
but she's your family.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.566
There's gotta be something good in her.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.650
No.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.654
She's just a selfish asshole.

13:41.737 --> 13:44.365
- You're gonna get through this, Jessica.
- No, I won't.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.536
I'm not gonna see my mother
the first Saturday of every goddamn month.

13:48.619 --> 13:52.122
She's going to some Guantanamo hellhole,
and I'm never gonna see her again.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.249
You downstairs?

13:55.376 --> 13:56.460
I'm going out.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.609
Shit.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.874
Come here.

15:16.582 --> 15:20.628
We ran several tests on the residue,
but couldn't identify all its components,

15:20.711 --> 15:24.256
including an organic plant-based element.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.383
Which means, of course,
we can't replicate the drug.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.135
Oh, that's not what I was after.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.058
You said you were interested
in reproducing it.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.697
- That's not what I meant.
- I wrote it.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.767
- "Customer interested in reproducing..."
- I misspoke.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.770
We wouldn't have done it, anyway,
given what's in it.

15:38.812 --> 15:39.897
What do you mean?

15:39.980 --> 15:41.482
The few chemicals we could ID

15:41.565 --> 15:44.818
contain toxins too dangerous
for any human being to ingest.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.280
And if someone did?

15:50.115 --> 15:53.744
Possible liver failure, kidney failure,
neurological degeneration,

15:53.827 --> 15:56.664
- maybe immunodeficiency...
- Got it. Thanks.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.587
Is it possible to track down
whoever made this crap?

16:03.671 --> 16:06.090
Maybe some compound
that's only available...

16:06.173 --> 16:08.842
No. Wish there was.
I'd report 'em in a hot second.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.594
But without the active ingredient...

16:10.678 --> 16:11.804
They get away with it.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.556
Thanks.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.458
I need you to delay the transfer.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.169
- You could have called.
- You might be bugged.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.546
That would be highly illegal.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.256
Special protocol, remember?

16:49.133 --> 16:53.595
Tell them that she'll confess
and hand over Karl.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.597
Will I be lying?

16:55.681 --> 16:56.849
I hope not.

16:56.932 --> 17:00.144
- Alisa won't sign if Dr. Malus isn't safe.
- He won't be an issue.

17:00.811 --> 17:04.231
Well, he will be
if he's locked behind bars

17:04.314 --> 17:06.692
or if you're taking him out
of the equation.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.069
Can you get the delay?

17:11.238 --> 17:14.032
Before you do anything,
there's someone I think you should meet.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.453
Inez? Shane?

17:22.458 --> 17:25.502
Jessica Jones, Shane Ryback.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.964
He's another beneficiary
of Dr. Malus's work.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.759
He has the power to heal.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.261
He healed Inez.

17:37.598 --> 17:38.974
Nice to meet you.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.352
Really?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.981
How long were you at the clinic?

17:47.399 --> 17:52.446
Hell if I know. It was over ten years ago.
I wasn't even conscious half the time.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.782
But you remember healing Inez?

17:55.282 --> 17:57.743
They were doing a lot of tests on me,

17:58.494 --> 18:01.246
making me lay hands
on people who were hurt or sick.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.833
I try to block it out.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.795
But it never seems to go away, does it?

18:07.878 --> 18:09.838
How come you never told me any of this?

18:10.380 --> 18:11.840
I didn't trust you.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.968
Turns out I was right.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.429
That thing that attacked me is your mom?

18:17.513 --> 18:20.182
I hope they lock her up
and melt the key down for bullets.

18:22.601 --> 18:26.939
I wanted you to meet Shane before you made
any decisions about Dr. Malus.

18:27.022 --> 18:30.442
What he did was unethical, yes,
but also miraculous.

18:30.526 --> 18:34.238
- Are you kidding me?
- Jessica, your mother is alive.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.616
You and Shane
have extraordinary abilities.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.868
With the proper funding and support,

18:39.952 --> 18:42.037
imagine what Dr. Malus' work could do
for the world.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.872
You want to profit from this.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.082
Screw profit.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.714
He healed me.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.636
And if it works,
he's given me a second chance.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.931
And I want other people
to have that same chance...

19:01.807 --> 19:05.769
instead of locking it behind bars
or eliminating it altogether.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.899
I don't know if you're for real.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.734
I don't even know what real is anymore.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.947
But I do know that you are not getting
your hands on Karl. Ever.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.240
Think about it, Jessica.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.618
Delay the transfer.
Get me in a room with my mother. Now.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.166
A vacation?

19:27.749 --> 19:29.334
Yeah, I've never been on one.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.421
And you had recommended some exotic city.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.047
Montevideo.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.885
Sounds like a place you could get lost in.

19:40.345 --> 19:44.892
You can do that?
Make travel plans and everything?

19:44.975 --> 19:46.310
I promise.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.230
If you promise to make the confession.

19:56.111 --> 20:01.074
We went on our first beach vacation
when you were 12. Do you remember?

20:03.368 --> 20:06.079
It was so nice to get away
from my life for a while.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.832
Remember where we stayed?

20:10.000 --> 20:14.254
Yeah, that weird hotel
where all the rooms had love themes.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.215
Mmm, the theme was prostitution.

20:16.798 --> 20:17.883
It was a hooker hotel?

20:17.966 --> 20:20.260
It was cheap.
It was two minutes from the water.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.470
You loved it.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.224
You always were a romantic.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.268
Sure.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.522
Valentine's Day, Sweet Valley High...
I'm all in.

20:34.566 --> 20:38.111
You kids... got into a fight

20:38.695 --> 20:40.572
about which room to stay in.

20:40.656 --> 20:45.160
You wanted Honeymoon Heaven.
Phillip wanted Tiki Hideaway.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.165
I chose the Paradise Suite.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.126
I loved it.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.673
Maybe I'll go pay it a visit.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.093
For old times' sake.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.228
She's loyal, your daughter.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.480
It's nice to see.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.902
My old man spent half his life
locked in a place like this.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.530
You surprised?

21:23.282 --> 21:24.950
I used to teach mathematics.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.618
Shit happens.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.664
- Is he still in prison?
- Dead. Diabetes.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.501
He went in whole.
They carried him out in pieces.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.089
Sorry.

21:42.050 --> 21:46.096
I loved him, but he was a shit bird.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.223
Never made a promise he wouldn't break.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.309
I'm nothing like him.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.144
We all tell ourselves that.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.313
Just make sure you stay healthy.

21:54.855 --> 21:58.400
- I'll be back when you finish your lunch.
- Oh, I'm done. I don't eat meat.

22:00.694 --> 22:01.737
Oh.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.989
We didn't know that.

22:04.573 --> 22:05.573
It's fine.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.368
Can't have you go hungry on my watch.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.453
I'm not hungry.

22:09.536 --> 22:12.706
All you got was some steamed vegetables
and a half potato.

22:12.789 --> 22:14.249
That's not enough calories.

22:14.916 --> 22:17.127
If I let you get finicky,

22:17.878 --> 22:21.340
everyone will want to do the same,
won't they?

22:24.384 --> 22:26.094
I'm not everyone.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.179
I know.

22:28.055 --> 22:30.849
You've killed people with your bare hands.

22:30.932 --> 22:35.437
As long as you're in my care,
it's my job to keep you under control.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.856
Just leave me alone.

22:37.939 --> 22:42.319
I can't. A promise is a promise.

22:44.696 --> 22:47.324
Now, eat your protein.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.413
You eat it.

22:53.497 --> 22:57.084
I warned you. Eat your protein, 46592.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.210
You eat it.

23:13.683 --> 23:17.437
You can leave here whole,
or you can leave in pieces.

23:17.521 --> 23:23.026
But one thing you will never do
is control me.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.347
What are you doing here? Where's Alisa?

23:52.430 --> 23:55.016
The only place that she's safe now
because of you.

23:55.892 --> 23:56.977
Prison.

23:57.602 --> 23:58.979
You're here to turn me in.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.231
I wish.

24:03.275 --> 24:07.320
The only chance my mother has
at some semblance of a normal life

24:07.404 --> 24:08.404
is to give you up.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.073
People pretty high up the food chain

24:10.157 --> 24:12.826
are interested
in your little experiments, so...

24:15.120 --> 24:16.454
they're offering her a deal.

24:16.538 --> 24:21.126
Look, I did everything I could to keep
my work away from those clowns in DC.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.796
If the wrong people
got their hands on it...

24:26.173 --> 24:27.841
It scares the hell out of me.

24:27.924 --> 24:28.925
Me, too.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.428
That's why I'm getting you out of here.

24:31.511 --> 24:34.264
I'm not cutting out on Alisa.
I... I have to help her.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.390
Here's how you help.

24:35.473 --> 24:38.602
You get on a plane and you go
to a country with no extradition.

24:38.685 --> 24:41.021
Then her confession can't hurt you.

24:41.104 --> 24:42.344
I don't give a crap about that.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.608
Do you give a crap
about her murdering more people?

24:44.691 --> 24:48.028
You know that she will go apeshit
if you get caught.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.572
This is the only way
that she takes the deal.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.119
I married her.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.623
Here. In this room.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.543
She was legally dead,
so I'm guessing that wasn't official.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.504
That didn't matter. It was the two of us.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.635
She carried me over the threshold.

25:11.718 --> 25:15.055
We stood right there,
and we said our vows.

25:16.389 --> 25:18.350
Alisa and I love each other.

25:20.143 --> 25:21.728
I need you to know that.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.491
Stand against that door.

25:35.825 --> 25:37.369
And take off your glasses.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.179
I'll be back with a new passport.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.807
You pack your bags.
You're going to South America.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.645
And if you ever go near
any kind of science again,

26:03.728 --> 26:07.315
I swear to God, I will hunt you down
and tear your arms off.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.909
How many others are there?

26:18.827 --> 26:23.331
Like me, like my mother,
like Robert Coleman, like Shane?

26:24.291 --> 26:25.291
Shane?

26:25.750 --> 26:28.962
Shane Ryback. The guy who heals people.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.473
I don't have a clue
who you're talking about.

26:31.548 --> 26:32.674
Don't lie to me.

26:32.757 --> 26:35.093
Jessica, I never treated anybody
named Shane.

26:35.176 --> 26:38.096
And I definitely never had a patient
that could heal other people.

26:40.807 --> 26:41.808
Shit.

27:04.622 --> 27:06.166
Move forward, inmate.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.193
Is that your real hair color,
or is it from a bottle?

27:35.153 --> 27:37.989
- Both.
- Mmm. That's what I thought.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.159
I'm surprised they let you in here
with all the security.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.744
The warden owes me one.

27:43.828 --> 27:47.749
I did a segment on her last year.
First female warden of a New York prison.

27:48.792 --> 27:49.918
Played well.

27:50.001 --> 27:51.002
Bully for you.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.337
I have questions.

27:53.421 --> 27:55.840
I thought you might have
questions for me, too.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.300
Just one.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.344
Shoot.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.098
Why did you come after us?

28:03.681 --> 28:04.681
I'm a journalist.

28:04.724 --> 28:06.351
You're a personality.

28:06.434 --> 28:09.229
I wanted to stop IGH from hurting people.

28:09.312 --> 28:11.189
Karl was saving lives!

28:11.272 --> 28:13.112
- Ma'am, move away from the inmate.
- I'm okay.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.111
- Ma'am.
- All right, I'm backing up. Just, uh...

28:16.361 --> 28:18.279
Just give us a few more minutes, please.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.907
It won't happen again.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.493
Five more minutes.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.371
Thank you.

28:27.580 --> 28:31.918
You were saying?
You hunted us down, because...

28:32.001 --> 28:33.837
I did it for my sister.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.004
Sister?

28:35.088 --> 28:38.174
Jessica was drinking more,
losing her temper.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.927
She's always had a temper. Just like me.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.724
I checked to see
if they transferred you to The Raft.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.267
They hadn't.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.936
So, clearly, you took a deal.

28:51.104 --> 28:53.690
But Dr. Malus hasn't been caught.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.985
So you haven't given him up yet.

29:00.196 --> 29:02.532
So you want me
to tell you where Karl is...

29:03.450 --> 29:06.494
so you can take the credit
and revive your pathetic little career.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.414
I wanna make sure
he surrenders peacefully.

29:09.789 --> 29:11.583
I'll get his side of the story out there.

29:11.666 --> 29:12.667
You'd do that?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.461
I wanna help Jessica put this behind her.

29:14.544 --> 29:17.255
- And if you love your daughter...
- If you loved my daughter...

29:17.839 --> 29:19.799
you'd stop this bullshit quest.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.302
- But you can't stop, can you?
- No.

29:22.385 --> 29:26.556
Because Karl experimented on her.
She never asked for powers.

29:26.639 --> 29:32.187
But she's got them, and you don't.
And you can't stand that, can you?

29:34.314 --> 29:37.776
That's why you wouldn't
let this investigation die.

29:38.902 --> 29:43.531
You are the reason
why I did everything I did!

29:43.615 --> 29:46.034
You did it because you're
a cold-blooded killer.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.036
That's why your own daughter
turned you in.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.872
I should have killed you
when I had the chance!

29:52.040 --> 29:55.084
Run back to Jessica.
Tell her about our little chat!

29:55.168 --> 30:00.131
But she is my daughter,
and she will always choose me over you!

30:10.016 --> 30:12.769
How much longer is this gonna take?

30:13.561 --> 30:15.772
I'm going as fast as I can.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.900
Don't want your friend caught
over a missing detail.

30:18.983 --> 30:20.944
He's not my friend.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.322
- Are you expecting someone?
- No.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.825
Shit.

30:33.456 --> 30:36.918
Hi, you don't know me.
I'm Trish Walker. I'm Jessica's friend.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.963
Trish, hi. Oscar. Nice to meet you.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.507
- You, too.
- What are you doing here?

30:42.590 --> 30:45.093
Uh, Malcolm told me
you guys were a thing, and...

30:45.718 --> 30:47.262
you weren't answering your phone.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.764
His kid's asleep.

30:50.473 --> 30:52.016
Let's talk in the hallway.

30:54.811 --> 30:55.895
What's going on?

30:57.188 --> 30:58.273
I met your mom.

31:00.441 --> 31:01.442
What?

31:01.526 --> 31:03.486
She said she should have killed me.

31:03.570 --> 31:07.031
Right after she blamed me
for her murder rampage.

31:08.783 --> 31:10.618
So what? You went to the prison?

31:13.413 --> 31:16.416
I needed to see what you saw in her.
But, Jess, I don't.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.710
That woman is an animal.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.466
She's been in a coma for five years.

31:26.718 --> 31:30.513
It does something
to a person's brain.

31:32.473 --> 31:34.058
She can't help herself.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.685
Bullshit.

31:35.768 --> 31:37.729
She planned those murders.

31:37.812 --> 31:41.608
She killed people to protect a man
who is just as dangerous as she is.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.776
Trish, you have to let it go.

31:43.860 --> 31:48.114
He's getting away with it. Okay?
She's paying, he's not. End of story.

31:48.197 --> 31:51.159
- Not if he does it again.
- He's not going to do it again.

31:53.786 --> 31:55.038
How do you know that?

31:58.249 --> 31:59.334
Oh, my God.

32:01.002 --> 32:04.464
That's why your mom took the deal.
You're helping him.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.382
I am not doing anything to help him.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.635
She's in your head.
She's manipulating you.

32:08.718 --> 32:09.878
You don't know the situation.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.639
- She's not who you think she is.
- She is my mother.

32:14.307 --> 32:17.727
She is mine to deal with.
You do not get a say.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.955
Morning, inmate.

33:19.038 --> 33:21.165
Got those shipped here especially for you.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.292
I'm gonna kill...

33:28.464 --> 33:30.216
I used to be a bad seed.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.887
Mad at the world
for kicking me in the teeth.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.851
Felt it was only fair to kick it back.

33:41.561 --> 33:44.313
But my grandparents changed all that.

33:49.402 --> 33:52.739
They took me hunting, fishing,
taught me to say, "Yes, sir," "No, sir."

33:54.449 --> 33:56.993
They loved me enough to impose rules.

34:06.669 --> 34:10.590
You're gonna learn my rules, 46592.

34:11.090 --> 34:13.634
But one word from me,

34:13.717 --> 34:16.387
and visitation
with that daughter of yours,

34:16.471 --> 34:17.472
it's over.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.266
Forever.

34:21.266 --> 34:22.435
So...

34:22.518 --> 34:24.728
you gonna eat your protein...

34:25.521 --> 34:26.522
or not?

34:35.782 --> 34:36.783
Hey.

34:37.617 --> 34:39.077
Hey, I think it's done.

34:39.659 --> 34:41.161
- Did it ding?
- No.

34:42.205 --> 34:43.246
It's not done.

34:43.331 --> 34:44.331
Shit.

34:48.585 --> 34:51.464
We've still got 24 hours
before the deal is pulled, right?

34:51.547 --> 34:53.757
I just want this to be over with.

34:57.053 --> 34:58.054
Then what?

35:02.350 --> 35:03.351
What do you mean?

35:03.935 --> 35:07.438
This guy disappears.
Uh, your mother, she takes the deal.

35:08.439 --> 35:09.524
What do you do?

35:11.150 --> 35:12.568
I get back to my life.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.570
What does that look like?

35:14.654 --> 35:17.281
Drinking. Sleeping.
Taking pictures of people cheating.

35:17.365 --> 35:18.616
It's all very glamorous.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.578
Why do you ask?

35:22.662 --> 35:25.123
I'm just trying to figure out
if we're a part of it.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.417
Are you sure you even want to?

35:30.086 --> 35:31.337
It's a lot.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.588
I'm a lot.

35:35.716 --> 35:39.637
- Does that mean it's finally done?
- That's the assembly. It's dry.

35:40.721 --> 35:42.974
I'll get it to you
first thing tomorrow morning.

35:43.057 --> 35:44.057
Morning?

35:49.814 --> 35:50.814
Shit.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.232
I gotta go.

36:05.454 --> 36:06.455
Hey.

36:14.589 --> 36:15.965
Call me when it's done, okay?

36:25.558 --> 36:26.684
Sign in, please.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.604
Yeah, I'll let you know. You got it.

36:34.108 --> 36:35.776
Your mother signed the paperwork.

36:40.489 --> 36:41.532
Great.

36:41.616 --> 36:45.161
I didn't expect a happy dance,
but a little gratitude would be nice.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.873
Whatever your motivation...

36:50.666 --> 36:52.919
I appreciate what you did for my mom.

36:53.628 --> 36:54.754
You're welcome.

36:56.255 --> 36:58.591
I know you don't trust me.
And I understand why.

36:58.674 --> 37:00.635
But after what I've been through...

37:01.636 --> 37:03.387
my intentions were genuine.

37:05.139 --> 37:08.893
You've stared death in the face.
You know how it can change a person.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.689
I'm changed.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.901
And it feels good.

37:23.866 --> 37:24.867
Jeri.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.415
I don't think you are...

37:32.083 --> 37:33.083
changed.

37:33.876 --> 37:35.316
Forgiveness is hard for you. I know.

37:35.378 --> 37:36.545
I mean physically.

37:37.129 --> 37:38.381
You're still...

37:42.468 --> 37:43.468
Shane's a fraud.

37:45.179 --> 37:46.347
I'm sorry?

37:46.430 --> 37:49.058
He was never at IGH,
and they never made a healer.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.102
- But Inez...
- She lied.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.523
She used what she knew
from working at IGH,

37:55.606 --> 37:56.941
and she made the whole thing up.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.568
I felt something when he touched me.

37:59.652 --> 38:03.823
- Because you wanted to feel something.
- I'm not some ignorant trailer park hick.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.951
What he did to me was real.

38:08.327 --> 38:10.037
I've had no symptoms.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.331
In, what, two days?

38:13.124 --> 38:15.376
You can't test for ALS, right?

38:15.459 --> 38:17.586
So you can't confirm the results.

38:17.670 --> 38:20.172
Inez is a nurse. She knew that.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.841
Mmm-mmm. No.

38:24.010 --> 38:25.761
- Let me deal with them.
- No.

38:25.845 --> 38:27.513
- Then you need to go the cops.
- No.

38:28.222 --> 38:31.267
Jeri, you don't deserve this.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.687
- They are scum.
- You're wrong.

38:34.770 --> 38:39.108
Whoever you talked to,
whatever they told you, it's wrong.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.652
Shane is real.

38:44.071 --> 38:45.364
Then just be careful.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.327
We don't know
what these people are capable of.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.830
I'll file Alisa's paperwork
by the end of business.

38:54.206 --> 38:56.292
Tomorrow, she gives her confession.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.975
Keep it still, 46592.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.068
What's up, guys?

39:34.914 --> 39:36.707
Well, those are sci-fi.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.877
Better than being chained
to the table like a dog.

39:46.258 --> 39:49.595
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.

39:54.266 --> 39:57.061
You told my best friend
that you should have killed her.

39:57.937 --> 40:01.982
I shouldn't have said that to Trish.
I know how much she means to you.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.110
That's how I managed
to keep my hands off her,

40:04.193 --> 40:07.863
but you have got to keep her
the hell away from Karl.

40:08.447 --> 40:09.281
On it.

40:09.365 --> 40:12.118
I can stomach this cage as long as I know
that both of you are okay.

40:12.201 --> 40:14.036
But if anything happens
to either of you...

40:15.246 --> 40:16.789
I will lose my shit.

40:16.872 --> 40:17.957
You won't have to.

40:20.709 --> 40:23.671
I've been working hard on this new case.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.965
And I think I'm getting close
to solving it.

40:27.550 --> 40:30.052
Just waiting on the paperwork.
It'll be tomorrow.

40:31.929 --> 40:32.930
Thank you.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.317
What happened to your arms?

40:45.401 --> 40:47.236
It's just a rash.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.071
That's a burn.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.406
Is it the cuffs?

40:50.990 --> 40:53.033
- Are they hurting you?
- Leave it alone.

40:57.204 --> 40:58.581
Who did this to you?

40:59.123 --> 41:01.125
I will handle this when the time is right.

41:01.208 --> 41:04.211
You handling things is what got you here
in the first place.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.588
Jessica, please.

41:07.756 --> 41:09.008
Jess... Jessica.

41:19.685 --> 41:20.936
You stay put.

41:21.020 --> 41:24.648
Don't do anything.

41:27.693 --> 41:29.487
I'll be back as soon as I can.

41:36.994 --> 41:38.704
See you later, fellas.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.593
Where are you?

41:53.761 --> 41:56.305
- I'm right here.
- No, you're not.

41:57.556 --> 42:00.518
I can't stop thinking about Jessica.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.271
Her mom is using her to get to Karl.

42:05.022 --> 42:06.440
You don't know that.

42:07.149 --> 42:08.776
Something's up with her.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.778
No. Something's up with you.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.240
Yeah, I fell off the wagon,
I quit my show,

42:15.032 --> 42:17.993
I bombed an audition for my dream job.

42:18.077 --> 42:21.747
And two weeks ago,
I hit my mother in the face.

42:22.873 --> 42:23.873
Damn.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.460
I haven't felt like myself in...

42:27.753 --> 42:29.129
I don't know how long.

42:30.464 --> 42:34.843
But knowing Karl is out there,
it's killing me, and...

42:35.803 --> 42:39.598
- I don't know. Maybe I'm messed up...
- No. Look, it kills me, too.

42:40.432 --> 42:43.394
See, Mal?
That's what brought us together.

42:44.728 --> 42:48.357
We can't just stand by
while bad shit happens. It's not in us.

42:50.109 --> 42:52.987
Um, Jessica's my boss. This is her family.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.071
We're her family.

42:54.154 --> 42:57.992
Okay, that woman has her hooks in so deep,
Jessica can't think straight.

43:00.035 --> 43:02.413
Okay, so she helps Karl. What next?

43:03.080 --> 43:04.790
How far will Jessica go?

43:05.624 --> 43:06.959
So you wanna find him?

43:08.002 --> 43:09.753
I'm going to find him.

43:09.837 --> 43:11.255
One way or another.

43:11.964 --> 43:14.133
And you want my help.

43:14.216 --> 43:16.969
- That's not why I'm here.
- But you want my help.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.432
Only what you're willing to give.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.644
But you are the PI.

43:27.813 --> 43:28.814
Associate.

43:31.317 --> 43:33.068
She's so gonna fire me for this.

43:33.152 --> 43:36.655
She'll be pissed. But she'll realize
we freaking saved her eventually.

43:37.156 --> 43:38.866
There's nothing in her recent searches.

43:40.576 --> 43:43.495
No deleted e-mails.
Let me check her cloud.

43:45.998 --> 43:47.166
Oh, shit.

43:48.208 --> 43:49.877
There are photos taken yesterday.

43:52.046 --> 43:53.172
I don't believe it.

43:53.255 --> 43:54.131
Believe it.

43:54.214 --> 43:56.216
Can we find out where these were taken?

43:57.593 --> 44:00.846
Uh, if Jess didn't turn off
her location data.

44:02.681 --> 44:03.682
Got it.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.941
I will let you know
as soon as I find him. I promise.

44:13.025 --> 44:14.505
Like I'm gonna let you do this alone.

45:09.581 --> 45:10.707
Ah...

45:11.708 --> 45:13.877
Oh.

45:16.422 --> 45:18.715
Oh.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.597
Oh...

45:25.681 --> 45:27.099
Oh, God.

46:01.759 --> 46:04.094
Hi, Jackie Charles here.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.018
I'm calling
from the New York Board of Prisons.

46:06.096 --> 46:10.517
You worked with Dale Holiday, didn't you?
You guys were both guards at...

46:12.936 --> 46:15.939
Great. Then I'm glad I tracked you down.

46:16.607 --> 46:20.736
Well, we are giving
a career achievement award to Dale,

46:20.819 --> 46:24.448
and we'd love to get
a few colorful anecdotes for our tribute.

46:25.866 --> 46:28.952
Yeah. Career achievement award.

46:32.164 --> 46:35.209
Really? When was he fired?

46:37.544 --> 46:41.423
May I ask why?
Not for publication, of course.

46:41.507 --> 46:44.067
I just wanna make sure we're giving
the award to a worthy member.

46:49.306 --> 46:52.309
You mean "prisoner suicides"?
As in plural?

46:53.894 --> 46:56.563
- Will you follow that bus?
- You got it.

46:57.481 --> 46:59.733
How many of these suicides were there?

47:13.497 --> 47:15.297
I flashed Karl's picture
to a couple of maids.

47:15.374 --> 47:16.374
They wouldn't talk.

47:16.959 --> 47:20.087
I guess what happens at the Love Motel
stays at the Love Motel.

47:20.629 --> 47:23.006
We could start knocking on doors, but...

47:23.090 --> 47:24.925
Would give him a chance to run.

47:25.008 --> 47:26.176
Then we wait.

48:17.519 --> 48:19.438
Oh, shit. There he is.

48:24.234 --> 48:25.736
He's looking for someone.

48:27.070 --> 48:28.905
Jessica?

48:33.660 --> 48:35.871
- What're you doing?
- Calling the cops.

48:35.954 --> 48:37.998
- Don't.
- Why not?

48:38.081 --> 48:40.208
He could be gone
by the time they get here.

48:40.292 --> 48:41.668
Okay, so what's your plan?

48:42.377 --> 48:43.754
I'm going in there.

48:43.837 --> 48:46.840
You stay out here
and keep an eye out for Jessica.

48:46.923 --> 48:50.218
- Trish, please, don't be crazy.
- You should leave.

48:52.471 --> 48:53.639
God damn it.

49:01.897 --> 49:04.524
Do you have a jack
or a lug wrench back here?

49:06.193 --> 49:07.194
Why?

49:07.861 --> 49:09.988
Because we're not going in there unarmed.

49:11.490 --> 49:12.491
I'm sorry.

50:09.798 --> 50:14.720
Being inside someone's house
is like being inside their head.

50:16.722 --> 50:20.475
I can find everything they're proud of...

50:21.935 --> 50:24.146
and everything that they want to hide.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.942
Now, what are you hiding, Dale?

51:20.535 --> 51:23.538
Dale inherited more
than his grandparents' house.

51:30.212 --> 51:32.714
He also got their love of trophies.

52:08.500 --> 52:09.960
If these were suicides,

52:11.294 --> 52:13.338
they wouldn't be on his wall.

52:14.756 --> 52:16.258
He likes to hunt.

52:28.854 --> 52:31.606
You attacked me.
You attacked me in my home!

52:31.690 --> 52:33.275
Self-defense!
