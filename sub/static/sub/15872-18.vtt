WEBVTT

00:00.191 --> 00:02.948
EMMA: <i>A few months ago, I</i>
<i>discovered I had a twin sister.</i>

00:03.068 --> 00:05.803
<i>And then she she asked me</i>
<i>to take her place,</i>

00:05.837 --> 00:08.118
<i>keep the secret, find our real mother</i>

00:08.238 --> 00:09.535
<i>and try to stay alive.</i>

00:09.568 --> 00:12.067
<i>Put yourself in my shoes.</i>

00:12.187 --> 00:15.504
<i>How long could you keep up</i>
<i>the lying game?</i>

00:15.538 --> 00:17.003
You keep surprising me.

00:17.037 --> 00:19.068
JUSTIN: Hey, Laurel.
LAUREL: <i>I'm betraying</i>

00:19.103 --> 00:20.603
my whole family by staying with you.

00:20.723 --> 00:22.611
So we're breaking up?
Yeah.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.960
Yeah, I was there the night
that Derek got killed.

00:24.994 --> 00:27.398
The guy I saw, he's
the District Attorney.

00:27.432 --> 00:28.971
Alec Rybak.

00:29.005 --> 00:31.276
The night Derek died,
you two had a date.

00:31.310 --> 00:34.445
And you were there all evening?
Yeah.

00:34.479 --> 00:36.477
I want to know what's going on
with you and Rebecca.

00:36.512 --> 00:37.811
Nothing is going on.

00:37.846 --> 00:40.383
I want you to stay away from my
family. Stay away from Sutton!

00:40.417 --> 00:42.618
EMMA:
<i>Sutton is with Ethan right now.</i>

00:42.653 --> 00:45.256
No idea where.
But I trust Ethan.

00:45.291 --> 00:46.726
I'm just wondering
if you can trust Sutton.

00:46.761 --> 00:48.828
I love you.
I always have.

00:53.099 --> 00:54.899
FBI! Freeze!

00:54.933 --> 00:57.264
OFFICER: <i>Ethan Whitehorse,</i>
<i>you're under arrest</i>

00:57.384 --> 00:58.866
<i>for the murder of Derek Rogers.</i>

01:00.341 --> 01:02.410
(siren whooping)

01:03.612 --> 01:06.148
(crowd murmuring)

01:14.092 --> 01:16.159
Ethan? Ethan. Hi.

01:16.193 --> 01:18.160
Ethan, we're going to
get you out, I promise.

01:19.529 --> 01:20.695
I love you.

01:23.233 --> 01:25.867

camera shutters clicking)

So do you have an attorney, son?

02:20.926 --> 02:22.794
No. I want to call
Sutton Mercer.

02:22.828 --> 02:25.163
Could I have a minute
with him, please?

02:25.197 --> 02:26.865
Come on, you know
it's against regulation.

02:26.899 --> 02:28.533
Yes, I know that, but he's a minor,

02:28.568 --> 02:30.402
and I'm his guardian.

02:30.436 --> 02:32.771
Two minutes.

02:35.741 --> 02:37.175
Don't worry. We're going to get
you through this, all right?

02:37.242 --> 02:39.710
Thanks, man.
Just be careful,

02:39.744 --> 02:41.545
keep your head down,
and watch that temper.

02:41.580 --> 02:43.881
How's Sutton holding up?

02:43.915 --> 02:45.682
Actually, Ethan, I had her all wrong.

02:45.717 --> 02:47.050
She's been a rock.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.452
ALEC: <i>We're going to ask</i>

02:49.486 --> 02:52.555
for a juvenile waiver, so we can
try the suspect as an adult.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.723
Crimes don't come any more
grown-up than murder.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.592
There's no reason
to put on kid gloves now.

02:56.626 --> 02:58.894
I'll take a couple of questions.
Chris, what do you got?

02:58.929 --> 03:00.763
Will you be handling
this case yourself?

03:00.797 --> 03:02.631
Oh, that's a big no can do.

03:02.666 --> 03:05.200
I don't think it's any secret
that the victim who...

03:05.235 --> 03:06.902
died so senselessly
was a friend of mine.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.437
Because of this relationship,

03:08.472 --> 03:10.306
I'll have to recuse
myself from the trial.

03:10.341 --> 03:12.608
However, my office will continue
to make this a top priority.

03:12.643 --> 03:15.145
We will not rest
until justice is served.

03:15.179 --> 03:17.247
What kind of bail will you ask for?

03:17.281 --> 03:18.648
Bail?

03:18.682 --> 03:20.617
I have a problem with
bail on this one,

03:20.651 --> 03:22.285
seeing as how the suspect's
already run once.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.553
What do they say?

03:23.588 --> 03:25.755
"Fool me twice, shame on me"?

03:25.790 --> 03:27.824
All right, guys.
Thanks for your time.

03:27.858 --> 03:30.293
(reporters clamoring)

03:34.865 --> 03:37.300
Okay, people are staring at me.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.671
It's probably that "A"
you got on your history final.

03:41.705 --> 03:43.005
Or, you know, the fact that

03:43.040 --> 03:44.440
your boyfriend just got
arrested for murder.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.774
It's definitely one of the two.
Ethan...

03:45.809 --> 03:47.543
did not kill anyone.

03:47.577 --> 03:48.710
It was all a misunderstanding.

03:48.745 --> 03:50.112
Hey, I know that.

03:50.146 --> 03:52.147
But good luck convincing Mom and Dad.

03:52.181 --> 03:53.982
They're in "concerned
parent" overdrive.

03:54.016 --> 03:57.151
I'll try to cover for you,
but no promises.

04:00.957 --> 04:02.558
Hey.

04:02.592 --> 04:05.160
I saw you talking with your sister.

04:05.194 --> 04:08.729
Is she doing okay?
I think so. Um...

04:08.764 --> 04:11.031
Thanks for asking.
What about you?

04:11.066 --> 04:12.967
I know it's always
a drag after a breakup.

04:13.001 --> 04:14.735
I'm okay.

04:14.769 --> 04:16.070
Mercer girls are tough.

04:16.103 --> 04:17.637
Well, hey, listen, if you feel like

04:17.706 --> 04:19.207
clearing your head or anything,

04:19.241 --> 04:21.209
we're gonna be working on
a couple new songs later.

04:21.243 --> 04:24.111
Yeah, I don't know if now
is, like, such a great time.

04:24.146 --> 04:25.780
It's just that we just got some really

04:25.814 --> 04:28.382
amazing news today.
So share.

04:28.417 --> 04:29.717
That demo that we sent out...

04:29.751 --> 04:32.520
Well, some people at Coachella
really dug it,

04:32.554 --> 04:33.988
and they want us
to play at the festival.

04:34.022 --> 04:37.225
Wait, we're playing Coachella?

04:37.259 --> 04:38.926
I mean, technically,
we'd be alternates.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.195
At the Oasis Dome, which is,
like, the smallest venue there,

04:41.229 --> 04:43.063
and of course we could
get bumped if, like,

04:43.097 --> 04:44.731
Modest Mouse shows up.
Oh, my God, Baz!

04:44.765 --> 04:46.399
No, that is amazing!
I have an uncle

04:46.433 --> 04:48.568
in Palm Springs who said
that we could stay with him.

04:48.602 --> 04:49.802
He can call your parents...

04:49.836 --> 04:51.671
Damn it. No.
Who am I kidding?

04:51.705 --> 04:54.673
No, they would never let me go.
Especially now.

04:54.708 --> 04:56.809
They're not exactly
in a permissive mood.

04:56.843 --> 04:58.143
But just think about it, okay?

04:58.178 --> 04:59.779
'Cause this a mad cool opportunity.

04:59.813 --> 05:02.748
You deserve it.

05:02.782 --> 05:04.550
So... brace yourself.

05:04.584 --> 05:05.985
I just talked to Thayer.

05:06.019 --> 05:07.487
He's on his way to get Sutton

05:07.521 --> 05:09.255
and bring her back from the ranch.

05:09.289 --> 05:11.323
Oh. Great timing.
Yeah.

05:11.358 --> 05:12.758
I'm not thrilled, either.

05:12.793 --> 05:14.394
Sorry, I don't mean to be petty.

05:14.428 --> 05:16.863
It's just that this separation
has been so hard,

05:16.897 --> 05:21.067
and it's the longest Ethan and I
have been apart since we met.

05:21.101 --> 05:24.337
And then to know that
she was there, with him...

05:24.371 --> 05:26.238
Well, maybe she's changed.

05:27.808 --> 05:29.675
Yes, I realized
how ridiculous that sounded

05:29.710 --> 05:30.943
the second I said it.

05:30.977 --> 05:32.945
Hey, it's <i>her</i> life.

05:32.980 --> 05:36.348
I'm not surprised
that she wants it back.

05:36.382 --> 05:38.216
(birds singing)

05:38.250 --> 05:40.018
(horse whinnies)

05:43.489 --> 05:45.824
Hey, thank you for the coffee.

05:45.859 --> 05:47.426
It really hits the spot.

05:47.461 --> 05:48.961
It was already made.

05:50.230 --> 05:52.197
Well, I appreciate it.

05:52.232 --> 05:54.500
(rooster crows)

05:54.534 --> 05:56.201
It's a beautiful country out here.

05:56.235 --> 05:57.635
Compared to what?

05:57.670 --> 06:00.038
Well, it's just nice, that's all.

06:00.072 --> 06:04.274
I took some pictures
to remember our visit.

06:04.309 --> 06:06.643
Here, take a look.

06:06.677 --> 06:07.877
I watched my son

06:07.912 --> 06:09.512
dragged off in handcuffs.

06:09.546 --> 06:10.880
For murder.

06:10.914 --> 06:12.882
I think I'll remember the visit.

06:15.352 --> 06:17.186
I will just get my stuff, then.

06:17.220 --> 06:18.220
Yeah.

06:20.323 --> 06:21.958
Listen, I don't know what
you've heard or imagined,

06:21.992 --> 06:23.226
but Ethan's innocent.

06:24.495 --> 06:26.696
Let me ask you something.

06:26.730 --> 06:29.132
Does an innocent man run?

06:29.166 --> 06:31.901
Well, he had no choice;
he was going to be framed.

06:33.170 --> 06:36.873
I taught him to stand
and fight his battles.

06:36.907 --> 06:39.910
This time, he ran.

06:39.944 --> 06:42.312
Maybe I don't know my son at all.

06:42.346 --> 06:45.215
Or maybe I'm as naive
as his girlfriend out there.

06:46.417 --> 06:47.918
Girlfriend?

06:47.953 --> 06:50.087
Are you talking about Sutton?

06:50.122 --> 06:51.789
That's... that's not
his girlfriend.

06:51.824 --> 06:53.725
(chuckles)

06:53.759 --> 06:56.060
Well, I'm not as naive as you.

06:57.296 --> 06:59.764
I left the bedding
in the laundry shed.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.468
(sighs heavily) Everything okay?

07:04.503 --> 07:08.506
Better get on the road...
if you want to beat traffic.

07:10.943 --> 07:13.277
SUTTON:
Okay...

07:17.682 --> 07:19.784
Thank you.

07:27.226 --> 07:28.460
Wait.

07:30.764 --> 07:33.132
Tell Ethan to... be strong.

07:34.902 --> 07:37.437
And, when he gets through this,

07:37.471 --> 07:39.472
he's welcome here.

07:41.042 --> 07:43.544
Tell him to come back.

07:44.078 --> 07:45.980
You, too.

08:04.114 --> 08:05.481
Too bad you're a little late.

08:05.515 --> 08:07.661
You just missed a hell of a show.

08:07.781 --> 08:09.708
Target practice? Really?

08:09.842 --> 08:13.745
The chief prefers
we practice on our own time

08:13.780 --> 08:15.180
rather than on the job.

08:15.214 --> 08:16.748
I thought you'd maybe
be doing something

08:16.782 --> 08:18.199
a little bit more important, like...

08:18.319 --> 08:20.485
I don't know, finding your
brother an attorney?

08:20.519 --> 08:22.987
I'm not careful, I could
be looking for one myself.

08:23.022 --> 08:26.157
I told Ethan to skip town;
I gave him money to do it.

08:26.192 --> 08:28.827
Well, you were protecting
your brother.

08:28.861 --> 08:31.196
Or aiding and abetting
a fugitive from justice.

08:31.231 --> 08:34.332
It's one of those, uh...
tomato-tomahto things.

08:34.366 --> 08:35.933
You can't give up on him now.

08:35.967 --> 08:37.403
He needs you.
He has a court-appointed attorney.

08:37.437 --> 08:39.236
I don't know what else
I can do for him.

08:39.272 --> 08:41.106
I have seen those
court-appointed attorneys

08:41.140 --> 08:42.841
in action. They barely

08:42.875 --> 08:45.110
read the case, and half the time,

08:45.144 --> 08:46.578
they just tell their
client to take a plea

08:46.612 --> 08:48.013
just so they can
lessen their workload.

08:48.047 --> 08:49.981
How do you know so much about that?

08:50.016 --> 08:51.750
I...

08:51.784 --> 08:53.652
Look, Mads told me that Alec

08:53.687 --> 08:55.854
assigned his star prosecutor
to this case.

08:55.888 --> 08:57.489
Ethan needs a legal genius

08:57.524 --> 08:58.891
to beat these charges.

08:58.925 --> 09:01.127
Well, legal geniuses
don't work for free.

09:01.161 --> 09:03.329
And I just checked under
my couch cushions, and...

09:03.363 --> 09:04.964
I happen to be a little light.

09:04.998 --> 09:07.066
Unless Ted and Kristin are gonna
pony up for a retainer.

09:07.101 --> 09:09.069
God, this is so unfair.

09:09.103 --> 09:11.038
You got that right.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.906
(sniffs)

09:12.941 --> 09:15.276
(sighs)

09:15.310 --> 09:17.745
Look...

09:19.214 --> 09:21.248
There might be one person I can call.

09:29.158 --> 09:31.125
Hey, can you hand me the lug wrench?

09:31.160 --> 09:33.461
You know I have no idea what that is.

09:33.495 --> 09:34.795
That thing right there.

09:34.830 --> 09:36.764
Here.

09:36.798 --> 09:38.733
So, anyway, Emma freaked

09:38.767 --> 09:40.968
when Mads told her
about what my dad said.

09:41.003 --> 09:43.404
That they've assigned
Ethan's case to this pit bull.

09:44.539 --> 09:47.608
- Emma's working on finding
a better defense attorney. - Mm-hmm.

09:47.643 --> 09:50.278
I mean, they could've just given
him a court-appointed lawyer,

09:50.312 --> 09:52.146
but Emma said that she's
seen these people work

09:52.180 --> 09:54.615
in foster care trials,
and they can be super lame.

09:54.650 --> 09:57.217
Emma said that sometimes,
it depends on who...

09:57.252 --> 09:59.653
And eleven.
What?

09:59.688 --> 10:02.122
Oh, I was just counting
the amount of times

10:02.157 --> 10:03.825
you began a sentence
with "Emma."

10:03.859 --> 10:05.426
You hit double digits.

10:05.460 --> 10:06.994
Why don't you just give her a break?

10:07.029 --> 10:08.830
All she's tried to do is help.

10:08.864 --> 10:11.599
Oh, 'cause that's what she does,
is it?

10:11.634 --> 10:13.634
Just helps everybody?

10:15.371 --> 10:18.906
You seem to have gotten
pretty cozy with her.

10:18.941 --> 10:20.641
The minute Ethan left town.

10:21.977 --> 10:23.911
Sorry. I...

10:23.946 --> 10:26.447
I'm just in a weird mood.

10:26.481 --> 10:28.482
Are you?
Just, up at the ranch,

10:28.516 --> 10:30.250
you're just so far away,

10:30.285 --> 10:34.021
and you reexamine everything
in your life...

10:34.055 --> 10:36.456
I don't know. It's just
kind of hard to go back.

10:36.490 --> 10:37.757
Oh. Really?

10:37.792 --> 10:38.992
So what exactly happened?

10:39.026 --> 10:40.960
Why, did Ethan say anything?

10:40.995 --> 10:42.261
No. I mean, it's not like

10:42.295 --> 10:43.829
we could talk to him,
but... you know.

10:43.864 --> 10:46.197
Yeah. No. I-I shouldn't...

10:46.232 --> 10:47.866
say anything.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.168
Well, no, it's fine, you can.

10:50.202 --> 10:52.236
I mean, if you want to.
Well, it's just...

10:52.271 --> 10:55.840
you know, when you're away
from all the BS, you...

10:59.011 --> 11:02.380
I just saw a side of Ethan

11:02.415 --> 11:04.816
that I don't think
any of us have ever seen.

11:11.557 --> 11:13.425
What is this, casual Fridays

11:13.459 --> 11:15.060
at the Scottsdale PD?
No.

11:15.094 --> 11:16.962
It happens to be my day off,

11:16.996 --> 11:19.264
and I thought that you
might like this look.

11:19.298 --> 11:21.166
It brings out my rugged

11:21.200 --> 11:23.068
yet soulful masculinity, yeah?
(laughs)

11:23.102 --> 11:25.938
I think you look good
in just about anything.

11:25.972 --> 11:28.775
Always bugged the crap out of me.

11:31.245 --> 11:34.180
You don't look so awful yourself.

11:38.085 --> 11:40.753
I, uh...

11:40.787 --> 11:43.388
I really appreciate
you coming down here.

11:43.422 --> 11:45.356
Well, I figured it
must be pretty important

11:45.391 --> 11:48.292
for you to pick up
the phone and call me

11:48.327 --> 11:50.828
for the first time
in what, seven years?

11:50.862 --> 11:52.496
Seven years, five months,

11:52.530 --> 11:54.998
and roughly, a couple of weeks, but...
(laughs)

11:55.033 --> 11:56.300
who's counting, right?

11:56.334 --> 11:59.103
Right. So tell me,

11:59.137 --> 12:02.573
why does Alec Rybak's
protégé-slash-whipping boy

12:02.608 --> 12:05.844
find himself in the need
of an A-list defense attorney?

12:05.878 --> 12:08.348
Alec is actually part
of the problem here.

12:08.382 --> 12:11.317
Alec? I'm stunned.

12:11.352 --> 12:12.919
Oh, gosh, here we go

12:12.953 --> 12:14.988
with the lecture again.
No, I mean, if only someone

12:15.023 --> 12:16.657
would have warned you
to break away from him

12:16.691 --> 12:19.393
when you graduated the academy
with that superhot girlfriend.

12:19.427 --> 12:21.896
I mean, whatever
happened to her, anyway?

12:21.930 --> 12:24.031
She got even hotter.

12:27.068 --> 12:30.070
All right, here's the deal.

12:30.105 --> 12:32.840
I assume that you're familiar
with the Derek Rogers murder?

12:32.874 --> 12:36.276
Yeah, the high school kid;
drug dealer.

12:36.310 --> 12:37.877
Sounds like they caught the killer.

12:37.912 --> 12:39.679
Some classmate, right?

12:39.714 --> 12:42.048
They got the wrong guy.

12:42.083 --> 12:45.418
And Alec is trying to
railroad the thing through.

12:45.452 --> 12:46.952
He's trying to get a quick conviction,

12:46.987 --> 12:48.921
looking tough on crime.

12:48.955 --> 12:51.890
Never mind that an innocent
kid is going down.

12:51.924 --> 12:54.425
Innocent kids go down
all the time, Dan.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.527
System's not perfect.

12:56.562 --> 12:58.897
Wh-Why is this one so important?

12:58.931 --> 13:01.132
This kid's my brother.

13:02.401 --> 13:04.436
Not... Ethan?

13:04.470 --> 13:05.971
Only one I got.

13:06.005 --> 13:09.006
Oh, my God, the last time
I saw him, he was...

13:09.041 --> 13:10.307
he was in Little League.

13:10.342 --> 13:13.043
Well, he's in the big leagues now,

13:13.078 --> 13:14.812
that's for damn sure.

13:16.481 --> 13:19.250
(sighs) Explain to me why I
have to stay here, again.

13:19.284 --> 13:21.152
Oh, come on, it's not that bad.

13:21.186 --> 13:23.221
It's just until we find a good time

13:23.256 --> 13:25.557
to make that switch with Emma.

13:26.859 --> 13:29.395
Mads. Hey.

13:29.429 --> 13:32.298
There's, uh, extra blankets
in the other room.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.201
Well, you two catch up.

13:34.235 --> 13:36.470
Sutton, try to get some rest,

13:36.504 --> 13:37.904
okay?

13:37.939 --> 13:39.573
(door opens)

13:45.346 --> 13:47.381
How's school?

13:47.415 --> 13:50.818
And there's food and soda
in the fridge.

13:50.852 --> 13:53.854
Okay, you're obviously mad at me,

13:53.889 --> 13:55.356
so let's just have it out.

13:55.390 --> 13:57.225
Is this because of the Ryan thing?

13:57.259 --> 13:59.694
If you're asking me,
am I still mad at you

13:59.728 --> 14:01.495
for hitting on him, yeah, still am.

14:01.530 --> 14:03.764
Oh, come on, I was
doing you a favor--

14:03.798 --> 14:05.566
vetting him, he passed,

14:05.600 --> 14:08.269
so... moving on.

14:08.303 --> 14:11.138
Is this because I didn't
tell you I had a twin?

14:11.172 --> 14:13.274
Do you seriously have to ask me that?

14:13.308 --> 14:15.509
I was going to tell you eventually.

14:15.543 --> 14:17.845
I was just waiting
for the right moment.

14:17.879 --> 14:19.480
How about any of those hundreds

14:19.514 --> 14:21.816
of moments when
I was feeling like a fool

14:21.850 --> 14:24.752
for not understanding why my
best friend was shutting me out?

14:24.786 --> 14:27.688
I said I was sorry.
You did?

14:27.722 --> 14:29.490
When? 'Cause
I must have missed it.

14:29.524 --> 14:33.127
And you know what I
feel really bad about?

14:33.162 --> 14:34.662
The times that I got mad at stuff

14:34.697 --> 14:36.764
that you did and I ended up
taking it out on Emma,

14:36.799 --> 14:38.833
who's been nothing but kind
to me since I've known her.

14:38.868 --> 14:40.435
Which has been what,
like, a few weeks?

14:40.469 --> 14:41.536
Well, long enough to know

14:41.571 --> 14:42.971
that Emma's a friend for life,

14:43.005 --> 14:45.073
which might be more
than I can say for you.

14:49.384 --> 14:50.490
(door closes)

14:57.253 --> 14:58.541
KRISTIN: Sutton!

14:58.678 --> 14:59.911
Where have you been?

14:59.946 --> 15:01.613
We've been starting to worry.

15:01.647 --> 15:04.715
I thought you'd be in bed.
As I told them

15:04.750 --> 15:07.652
they should be, since you
were probably at the library.

15:07.686 --> 15:09.988
I was at the jail trying to see Ethan.

15:10.022 --> 15:11.623
Huh.

15:11.657 --> 15:14.025
See, now, that
I wouldn't have guessed.

15:14.059 --> 15:15.526
TED: Well, I can't say
that I'm surprised.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.262
I saw you on TV this morning;
a lot of folks did.

15:18.296 --> 15:19.830
I was just trying to support him.

15:19.865 --> 15:21.832
He's totally alone.

15:21.867 --> 15:24.235
SUTTON: Do you have any idea
what it's like to be dragged

15:24.270 --> 15:26.938
in there in handcuffs in front
of all those news cameras?

15:26.972 --> 15:28.907
Well, having never been
arrested for murder,

15:28.941 --> 15:31.376
no, I can't say that I do.
Ted.

15:31.410 --> 15:33.011
Okay, well, none of my friends think

15:33.045 --> 15:34.545
that Ethan could've murdered someone.

15:34.580 --> 15:35.813
TED: Laurel, honey,
I think it's time

15:35.848 --> 15:38.016
for you to turn in--
this is between Sutton and us.

15:38.050 --> 15:40.051
Okay.

15:41.053 --> 15:42.720
Love you, sis.
Hang in there.

15:42.754 --> 15:44.389
- Thank you. - Good night.
- Good night.

15:44.423 --> 15:47.559
KRISTIN: Okay, I think the one
thing we can all agree on is,

15:47.593 --> 15:50.562
the trial could be all-consuming.
TED: And very public.

15:50.596 --> 15:52.664
Everyone will be watching this.
I think we need

15:52.699 --> 15:55.000
- to come up with some ground
rules that we can all agree... - Yeah,

15:55.034 --> 15:56.702
like not hanging around the city
jail half the night, huh?

15:56.736 --> 15:58.804
Sutton, we're just
trying to protect you.

15:58.839 --> 16:01.507
The police have already brought
you in for questioning.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.410
I think maybe you do need
to distance yourself.

16:03.444 --> 16:05.445
I know you don't like him.

16:05.479 --> 16:07.146
This isn't a question of us
It's not about that...

16:07.181 --> 16:08.748
disapproving of a boyfriend.

16:08.783 --> 16:10.783
He is a murder suspect!
Then isn't he entitled

16:10.817 --> 16:12.284
to a fair trial?
Oh...

16:12.319 --> 16:14.686
People are innocent
until proven guilty.

16:14.721 --> 16:16.488
Sutton, listen to me...

16:16.523 --> 16:18.857
No, I'm sorry, I just,
I need to go to bed.

16:25.699 --> 16:28.000
Oh, what, so now this is my fault?

16:28.034 --> 16:31.404
I was trying to reason with her like an
adult, and you kept... She's not an adult.

16:31.439 --> 16:32.739
That's the point.
...interrupting and lashing out!

16:32.774 --> 16:35.242
You are the one that
is gonna drive her away!

16:35.277 --> 16:36.544
Oh, is that so? Okay.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.479
Is that so? So
I just can't

16:38.514 --> 16:40.181
seem to do anything right
around here, then, huh?

16:40.215 --> 16:42.917
That is not what I am saying.
Well, that's what it feels like.

16:42.951 --> 16:44.419
TED: You know that?

16:44.453 --> 16:46.220
You're second-guessing
me left and right.

16:46.254 --> 16:50.124
I mean, sometimes it feels
like I'm the one on trial!

16:50.159 --> 16:53.261
- So, when you and Thayer
arrived at the body shop... - No.

16:53.295 --> 16:55.830
Sutton. Thayer wasn't there.
Are you sure?

16:55.864 --> 16:57.732
I could've sworn
that I saw Thayer's name.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.801
Okay. So Thayer was with you
when you went to Derek's house.

17:00.836 --> 17:03.003
Thayer, house, Sutton, body shop.
T-H-S-B-S.

17:03.037 --> 17:05.806
I'll just, I'll come up with
a mnemonic or something.

17:05.839 --> 17:09.542
Uh, now, how long have you and
Mr. Rogers been acquainted?

17:09.577 --> 17:11.345
(keys jingling, gate unlocking)

17:14.782 --> 17:16.784
Theresa Lopez.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.352
I don't believe it.

17:18.387 --> 17:20.855
I'll be taking your case now.
(clears throat)

17:20.888 --> 17:22.223
I beg your pardon?

17:22.257 --> 17:25.193
Uh, who do you think that I am, then?

17:26.462 --> 17:28.763
The guy my client
was just about to fire.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.600
(laughs softly)

17:31.634 --> 17:34.703
Well, often they'll wait a few
days before the arraignment

17:34.738 --> 17:36.705
so that the suspect

17:36.740 --> 17:38.841
can get an idea
of what prison would be like.

17:38.876 --> 17:40.310
That's awful.

17:40.344 --> 17:42.379
THERESA (chuckles):
Yeah, but it works.

17:42.413 --> 17:43.881
Especially if the kid
is nervous and scared;

17:43.915 --> 17:45.849
by the time he gets
in front of the judge

17:45.884 --> 17:46.984
he's ready to cop a plea.

17:47.018 --> 17:48.386
That's not Ethan.

17:48.420 --> 17:49.821
Well, good, because
that's not me, either.

17:49.855 --> 17:51.490
Listen, I'm sure you
don't hear this often,

17:51.524 --> 17:54.126
but we should probably wrap this up,

17:54.160 --> 17:57.296
- or your crack legal team here is
gonna miss first period. - All right, look,

17:57.331 --> 18:00.066
I've been over the evidence--
their case is weak.

18:00.101 --> 18:01.768
They don't have a murder weapon,

18:01.803 --> 18:03.704
and it's hard to get
a conviction without one.

18:03.738 --> 18:05.773
Okay, so what should we all be doing?

18:05.807 --> 18:07.408
Well, right now I'm looking at Ethan

18:07.442 --> 18:09.476
as a person of interest,
so we need to think

18:09.510 --> 18:10.810
of other persons of interest.

18:10.845 --> 18:12.846
Who else would've
wanted this kid dead?

18:15.916 --> 18:17.717
(sighs) Not this again.

18:17.751 --> 18:19.719
Mads, you think this is easy for me?

18:19.753 --> 18:22.488
I hate this.
Then don't do it.

18:22.522 --> 18:24.824
Hey, come on, now,
don't keep things from me.

18:24.858 --> 18:26.258
I'm on your side here.

18:29.463 --> 18:32.765
There was this... frat guy.

18:33.934 --> 18:37.470
He went to buy weed
from Derek that night

18:37.504 --> 18:40.773
and... saw someone there.

18:40.808 --> 18:43.810
In silhouette, from a distance,
and it was dark.

18:43.844 --> 18:45.845
THAYER: Apparently it wasn't
that dark. We tracked

18:45.880 --> 18:47.313
the guy down at this frat house party

18:47.348 --> 18:49.215
and asked him about that night.

18:49.250 --> 18:51.451
Once again, the night that
he was out buying drugs.

18:51.485 --> 18:53.153
Yeah, so what if he was, Mads?

18:53.188 --> 18:55.756
He definitely saw who was there.

18:55.790 --> 18:58.126
He was a hundred percent certain.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.394
That's huge!

18:59.428 --> 19:00.762
That's great!

19:00.796 --> 19:02.364
EMMA: I'm not so sure.

19:04.266 --> 19:07.035
The guy he saw was Alec Rybak.

19:15.143 --> 19:17.110
EMMA: <i>It was just, like,</i>

19:17.145 --> 19:19.746
one minute we were all working
on the case together,

19:19.780 --> 19:23.115
and then the second
I mentioned his name,

19:23.150 --> 19:26.586
she just lost all of her
confidence and got scared.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.254
She said that it was too dangerous

19:28.289 --> 19:30.190
and that we should back off.
Okay,

19:30.224 --> 19:31.458
because of Alec?

19:31.492 --> 19:33.360
(laughs) Tell me you're joking.

19:33.395 --> 19:36.097
You know, we shouldn't
even be talking about this.

19:36.131 --> 19:37.532
S-Sutton,
he is... family.

19:37.566 --> 19:39.234
In fact, I think Mom and Dad

19:39.268 --> 19:41.069
even signed some
guardianship agreement

19:41.104 --> 19:44.540
that, like, they get killed in a
car crash, Alec would raise us.

19:44.574 --> 19:47.275
And now, what,
you think he killed Derek?

19:47.310 --> 19:49.377
I mean, that's just kind of insane.

19:49.411 --> 19:50.945
I'm just telling you what she said.

19:50.980 --> 19:53.146
She said, "Let this go.
I know this guy."

19:53.181 --> 19:56.383
Be very, very careful."

19:56.417 --> 19:59.151
LAUREL: Uh-huh.

19:59.186 --> 20:01.754
Oh, looks like I'm not the only one

20:01.788 --> 20:04.256
with some mystery in my life.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.724
No, it's just a joke.

20:05.758 --> 20:07.393
A joke that made you blush.

20:07.427 --> 20:08.928
Stop. You were
talking about Alec.

20:08.962 --> 20:11.097
Are you gonna confront him or what?

20:11.131 --> 20:12.665
No, not directly.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.768
I already tried,
and it didn't really work.

20:14.802 --> 20:16.402
<i>But</i> I may have

20:16.437 --> 20:18.638
a way in.

20:22.877 --> 20:26.780
I went to the frat,
and I talked to that kid

20:26.815 --> 20:29.416
and I heard his story, and
I know that he isn't lying.

20:29.450 --> 20:31.918
But how, how do you know?

20:31.953 --> 20:33.953
I mean, for all we know,
this kid could be

20:33.988 --> 20:37.089
brought up on charges and trying
to lessen his sentence

20:37.124 --> 20:38.691
by making outlandish claims.

20:38.725 --> 20:40.826
I just feel it in my gut.

20:40.861 --> 20:42.862
And the truth is, I...

20:42.896 --> 20:44.163
(sighs): Never mind.

20:44.197 --> 20:46.466
It's... nothing.

20:48.436 --> 20:50.537
Sutton...

20:50.571 --> 20:52.305
I'm not gonna say anything to anyone,

20:52.340 --> 20:56.176
and I want you to feel safe
saying what's on your mind.

20:56.211 --> 20:59.714
There's just something
about Alec that I don't trust.

20:59.748 --> 21:01.783
I get this feeling
when I'm around him,

21:01.817 --> 21:03.552
and I've had it for a while now.

21:03.586 --> 21:04.920
But is it enough?

21:04.954 --> 21:06.856
You come out in the open with this,

21:06.890 --> 21:09.191
you could ruin
his reputation, his career.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.760
You could destroy his life.

21:10.794 --> 21:13.396
And what about Ethan's life?

21:13.430 --> 21:16.199
Does nobody care what happens to him?

21:16.233 --> 21:19.035
You really love this Ethan, huh?

21:19.069 --> 21:21.171
More than anything in the whole world.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.609
I'm gonna help you, Sutton.

21:27.345 --> 21:29.613
Alec-- leave him to me.

21:31.148 --> 21:34.084
I promise it'll work out.

21:34.118 --> 21:35.952
You'll see.

21:41.826 --> 21:43.893
Obviously, you two didn't get the note

21:43.927 --> 21:46.128
that this is a very bad idea.

21:46.163 --> 21:48.831
What, potentially implicating
my father in a murder charge?

21:48.865 --> 21:51.799
Trust me, I know what
a bad idea it is.

21:51.834 --> 21:54.736
Here's my dad's cell phone
records for the last two months.

21:54.770 --> 21:57.338
23 calls to Derek, seven from him.

21:57.372 --> 21:59.974
There's also a written description
from Jesse, the frat guy,

22:00.008 --> 22:02.008
about what my dad was
wearing that night.

22:02.043 --> 22:04.544
It matches.

22:04.578 --> 22:06.646
What, no surveillance videos?

22:06.681 --> 22:08.048
I'm gonna be honest.

22:08.082 --> 22:09.650
If I would've known

22:09.684 --> 22:11.953
that the only way
to get this guy off is

22:11.987 --> 22:13.521
to somehow bring down
the district attorney,

22:13.555 --> 22:15.990
I might have run the
other way from this case.

22:16.025 --> 22:17.626
Maybe Ethan needs
a better lawyer, then.

22:17.660 --> 22:19.161
There isn't one.

22:19.195 --> 22:21.196
But we're dealing with
a powerful guy here,

22:21.231 --> 22:23.499
and if he finds out
that I'm snooping around

22:23.534 --> 22:25.569
his personal life
with-with his own kids?

22:25.603 --> 22:27.170
This could get ugly.

22:27.204 --> 22:29.372
We're not backing down
until Ethan's set free.

22:29.407 --> 22:31.908
Sutton, do you have a sec?

22:31.943 --> 22:34.478
I-I have a
message for you.

22:37.148 --> 22:41.218
Ethan wanted me to
tell you that he's okay,

22:41.252 --> 22:45.022
and that he's counting down
the minutes until he sees you.

22:45.056 --> 22:47.424
God, it's unbearable.

22:47.459 --> 22:50.060
I know exactly how you feel.

22:50.095 --> 22:51.544
I don't think you do.

22:51.664 --> 22:52.756
Trust me.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.414
I used to call him Danny back then.

22:56.401 --> 23:00.538
You're not the first girl to
fall under the Whitehorse spell.

23:02.358 --> 23:04.734
If I could just see him...

23:04.854 --> 23:06.977
for, like, a minute.

23:09.348 --> 23:11.054
Let me see what I can do.

23:13.798 --> 23:16.334
Delicious, hon.
You've really outdone yourself.

23:16.454 --> 23:18.221
It's really good.

23:18.256 --> 23:19.623
I wish Sutton were here.

23:19.657 --> 23:22.124
She loves salmon.

23:22.159 --> 23:25.273
I think she said something
about a... tennis meeting,

23:25.393 --> 23:26.593
that it might run late.

23:26.993 --> 23:28.564
I think I can guess where she is.

23:28.599 --> 23:29.865
KRISTIN: Ted,
please, let's not...

23:29.900 --> 23:31.500
Oh, like it's a secret. Come on.

23:31.534 --> 23:34.336
We all saw her throwing herself
at the kid on the news.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.739
We expect her to show up
for family dinners?

23:36.773 --> 23:39.842
Not when you... lay into her
when she finally does show up.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.111
What am I supposed to I do,
coddle her? Buy her a pony?

23:42.146 --> 23:44.213
I'm sure she'll be home soon.

23:44.248 --> 23:45.782
And you need to stop covering
for her, okay?

23:45.816 --> 23:47.216
It does her no good.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.785
Okay, okay.

23:50.120 --> 23:51.854
I'm sorry.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.424
I didn't mean to snap.

23:54.458 --> 23:56.593
It's a tough time for everyone.

23:56.627 --> 23:59.295
We haven't even asked you
about your day.

23:59.329 --> 24:01.096
How was, you know, school?

24:01.131 --> 24:02.798
How's the band?
How is that going?

24:02.832 --> 24:08.138
Well, we... got
this amazing opportunity

24:08.172 --> 24:11.474
to play at this huge
music festival in California.

24:11.509 --> 24:14.211
California. Yikes.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.780
It's one of the most prestigious
festivals in the country.

24:16.815 --> 24:18.349
It's, like, three days and nights

24:18.383 --> 24:19.750
of nonstop music
from all over the world.

24:19.785 --> 24:22.320
Yeah, I think I've heard of it.

24:22.354 --> 24:24.355
It's called Parents Worst
Nightmare-apalooza.

24:24.389 --> 24:26.123
Actually,

24:26.157 --> 24:27.958
it's really well-organized,

24:27.992 --> 24:30.893
and Baz's uncle has a place
right there that we could stay.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.495
You're not actually
thinking about this, are you?

24:32.529 --> 24:34.463
You're 16 years old.

24:34.498 --> 24:35.798
It's just a weekend.

24:35.832 --> 24:37.166
KRISTIN:
I think it is a long time

24:37.200 --> 24:38.467
to go unchaperoned.

24:38.501 --> 24:39.802
TED:
Yeah, you're not kidding.

24:39.836 --> 24:41.336
Look, sweetie, you guys are great.

24:41.371 --> 24:43.672
You keep at it,
you will get something great.

24:43.706 --> 24:45.474
Something local.

24:45.509 --> 24:47.176
I'm sure you will.

24:47.211 --> 24:49.579
Yeah.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.781
That's what I thought.

24:55.553 --> 24:56.987
And we're gonna have a verdict

24:57.022 --> 24:59.090
by the end of the month,
and that's good.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.759
(clears throat): It's great
for the district, you know.

25:00.793 --> 25:03.228
People want safe streets.
I know. I read the polls.

25:03.262 --> 25:05.596
This could be a
stepping stone, you know.

25:05.631 --> 25:06.931
Lot of bigger blue-chip

25:06.965 --> 25:08.232
political careers have been launched

25:08.266 --> 25:10.400
with far less fanfare.

25:10.435 --> 25:12.802
Aren't you just a little concerned

25:12.837 --> 25:14.237
that you might have an innocent man?

25:14.271 --> 25:15.938
Ethan Whitehorse is a bad egg.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.840
He's always been a bad egg.

25:17.874 --> 25:19.275
You look up

25:19.309 --> 25:20.676
"bad egg" in the dictionary,

25:20.710 --> 25:22.744
there's a picture of Ethan Whitehorse.

25:22.779 --> 25:25.147
Yeah, but that doesn't
make him a murderer.

25:25.181 --> 25:27.583
WAITER: I'm sorry
to disturb you.

25:27.617 --> 25:29.819
It seems someone has left
a message for you

25:29.853 --> 25:31.254
with our hostess.

25:31.288 --> 25:32.822
Okay, thanks. That's odd.

25:32.857 --> 25:34.758
No one knows I'm here.

25:34.792 --> 25:37.128
What is it?

25:38.397 --> 25:40.131
(sighs)

25:43.803 --> 25:46.638
(laughing)

25:46.672 --> 25:50.108
That's just... silly.

25:50.142 --> 25:52.878
That doesn't upset you?
Nope.

25:52.912 --> 25:54.513
But if it makes you feel better,

25:54.547 --> 25:56.148
I'll go try and find out who left it.
No.

25:56.182 --> 25:58.517
Whoever sent it is probably
long gone by now.

25:58.551 --> 26:00.886
Look, I pissed somebody
off, that's all.

26:00.920 --> 26:04.222
(sighs) Now they're trying to
intimidate me with a scary note.

26:04.256 --> 26:05.390
It's not gonna work.

26:05.424 --> 26:07.558
Who would want to do this to you?

26:07.593 --> 26:09.060
A lot of people.

26:09.094 --> 26:10.761
That's a long list.

26:10.795 --> 26:12.897
I work with the dregs of society.

26:12.931 --> 26:15.733
I lock 'em up and
hope they lose the key.

26:15.767 --> 26:18.535
Doesn't exactly endear
me to a lot of people.

26:18.570 --> 26:20.704
I've got a whole steamer trunk
full of hate mail I...

26:20.738 --> 26:23.106
Look, why don't we just let it go?
(sighs) How do you know

26:23.141 --> 26:25.876
this has nothing to do
with Derek Roger's case?

26:25.911 --> 26:28.212
I'm not sure I follow
your line of questioning.

26:28.247 --> 26:29.614
Well, I'm-I'm just saying.

26:29.649 --> 26:31.183
I mean, that's the case

26:31.217 --> 26:33.218
that you're working on
right now, right? What...?

26:33.253 --> 26:34.787
What if somebody knows something?

26:34.821 --> 26:38.090
What are you trying to say?

26:38.125 --> 26:42.195
Well, I could see how you could
be so quick to accuse Ethan.

26:42.229 --> 26:43.730
Tell you what.

26:43.764 --> 26:45.665
We both had a little bit to drink.

26:45.699 --> 26:47.800
(clears throat) Maybe I should
just get the check.

26:47.835 --> 26:48.901
That way,

26:48.936 --> 26:50.402
neither one us

26:50.437 --> 26:52.204
might say something
we'll regret later.

26:55.141 --> 26:58.810
I'm telling you, it's like
a minefield back there.

26:58.844 --> 27:01.412
Ted and Kristin are so
freaked out by this trial.

27:01.447 --> 27:03.848
Mm-hmm. Sounds like
someone is trying

27:03.883 --> 27:06.051
to keep me from taking my life back.

27:06.085 --> 27:09.355
Hey, if you think you're up for it,

27:09.389 --> 27:10.756
be my guest.

27:10.791 --> 27:12.558
It's just not gonna be easy for you.

27:12.593 --> 27:14.327
They don't know how to deal with it.

27:14.361 --> 27:17.163
The other night, they got
in a huge fight about me.

27:17.198 --> 27:18.999
You. You-You know.

27:19.033 --> 27:21.535
Really?
I'm just saying, if you say the wrong thing,

27:21.569 --> 27:23.670
you might get shipped
off to boarding school.

27:23.705 --> 27:26.731
Ugh! Uniforms. Okay.

27:26.829 --> 27:30.260
Well, I guess you can keep being
me until the trial is over.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.204
I mean, I need

27:32.238 --> 27:34.873
to decompress after the ranch...

27:34.907 --> 27:36.541
Right.

27:36.575 --> 27:39.330
I'm sorry. That was insensitive.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.460
But if it's any consolation, Ethan

27:41.589 --> 27:44.057
was talking about you
the whole time we were there.

27:44.092 --> 27:45.058
Really?

27:45.093 --> 27:46.894
Oh, yeah. We would go on these

27:46.928 --> 27:49.332
really long rides--

27:49.452 --> 27:50.967
you know,
to exercise the horses--

27:51.087 --> 27:54.301
and he just kept going on and on

27:54.335 --> 27:56.837
about how much
you would love it there.

27:56.872 --> 27:58.551
Sounds amazing.

27:58.671 --> 28:01.509
It's just like a whole
other world out there.

28:01.544 --> 28:05.146
It's just so beautiful and

28:05.181 --> 28:06.554
spiritual.

28:06.674 --> 28:09.083
I don't know.
Compared to Phoenix,

28:09.118 --> 28:11.853
it's just so much more real.

28:13.022 --> 28:14.355
You'll get there someday.

28:14.390 --> 28:17.058
(phone ringing)

28:17.092 --> 28:20.061
Well, okay, I have to fly, because...

28:20.095 --> 28:22.063
that was a parental warning call.

28:22.097 --> 28:24.265
Ugh, they need to get a life.

28:24.299 --> 28:25.694
They care about you.

28:25.814 --> 28:27.682
I know, I know.

28:27.802 --> 28:30.171
I have to confess,
I'm a little envious

28:30.206 --> 28:33.409
that you got to spend so much
time with Ethan at the ranch.

28:33.443 --> 28:35.010
Meet his father.

28:35.044 --> 28:37.413
Oh, you would love Ben.

28:37.447 --> 28:40.116
(phone chirps)

28:48.092 --> 28:50.593
Uh, he and Ethan have
a very rough relationship.

28:50.628 --> 28:52.395
Although, I have to say,

28:52.430 --> 28:55.098
I think I may have actually
brought them closer together.

29:05.276 --> 29:07.911
I don't know, Emma.
I think you're rubbing off on me.

29:09.335 --> 29:11.964
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

29:12.084 --> 29:16.488
Good. Now maybe you can help me
repair my friendship with Mads.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.457
I'm sure it'll be fine.

29:18.492 --> 29:20.092
It'll just take some time.

29:20.127 --> 29:22.495
Okay, be safe.
Mm-hmm. Hey!

29:23.697 --> 29:25.231
Don't forget your phone.

29:41.514 --> 29:43.514
(sighs)

29:45.117 --> 29:46.484
Hi.

29:46.519 --> 29:47.501
Sorry I'm late.

29:47.621 --> 29:49.421
Hey. It's okay.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.132
I was starting to think
you were gonna stand me up.

29:51.252 --> 29:53.427
So unlike you, and so like Sutton.

29:53.547 --> 29:56.429
Okay, she's not entirely bad.

29:56.463 --> 29:58.398
Please. You should have
seen her with me,

29:58.432 --> 30:00.166
pretending she had no idea

30:00.200 --> 30:02.535
why I'd be furious with her.
Well, sometimes

30:02.570 --> 30:04.604
she just acts that way.

30:04.638 --> 30:07.040
If it helps, she did say

30:07.074 --> 30:09.443
she feels awful about what
happened with you guys.

30:09.477 --> 30:11.245
Really?
Yes.

30:11.279 --> 30:15.582
In fact, she asked me if I
would help make things right.

30:15.616 --> 30:17.517
Hmm.

30:17.552 --> 30:18.441
I don't know.

30:18.561 --> 30:21.617
Things are just crazy
for everyone right now.

30:21.910 --> 30:23.544
And how are you holding up?

30:23.578 --> 30:26.769
Well, Theresa said she would text me

30:26.889 --> 30:30.089
about getting in to see Ethan,
but I haven't heard from her.

30:31.252 --> 30:33.654
Guess it just didn't work out.

30:41.356 --> 30:42.709
THERESA:
Sutton?

30:42.829 --> 30:45.349
You ready?

30:45.383 --> 30:47.785
Yes. Let's do this.

30:54.260 --> 30:56.528
(baton clanking on bars)

31:03.036 --> 31:05.704
You have five minutes.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.439
(clears throat) Oh.

31:07.473 --> 31:09.540
I don't believe this.

31:09.575 --> 31:11.575
I left a file in my car.

31:11.610 --> 31:13.911
It's in the lot right
across the street,

31:13.945 --> 31:15.913
Yeah, okay.
Make it snappy.

31:15.947 --> 31:18.115
You, stand behind the yellow line.

31:18.149 --> 31:19.416
Romeo,

31:19.451 --> 31:21.184
keep your hands inside.

31:27.025 --> 31:28.159
(exhales)

31:31.030 --> 31:34.365
I missed you.

31:37.136 --> 31:39.505
Is everything okay?

31:39.539 --> 31:41.908
There's something I have to tell you.

31:44.045 --> 31:46.913
When I was on my dad's ranch
with Sutton, something happened.

31:48.382 --> 31:51.683
Mm, it almost happened.
It was stupid.

31:54.020 --> 31:55.620
Okay.

31:55.655 --> 31:57.355
Well, I understand.

31:57.390 --> 31:59.324
I mean, you and

31:59.358 --> 32:02.493
Sutton have a... have a past.

32:02.528 --> 32:03.961
No.

32:03.996 --> 32:06.697
No. It-it was a mistake.

32:06.731 --> 32:09.433
Okay, I regretted it
the second it happened,

32:09.468 --> 32:12.637
and I felt sick about it ever since.

32:12.671 --> 32:14.973
Are you sure that's how you feel?

32:15.008 --> 32:16.876
Emma,

32:16.910 --> 32:19.011
you have to believe me.

32:19.046 --> 32:21.248
Sutton means nothing to me.

32:23.218 --> 32:25.386
Nothing.

32:25.420 --> 32:27.855
I see.

32:32.061 --> 32:35.130
You know, there's something
that I have to tell you.

32:35.164 --> 32:37.399
When I...

32:37.433 --> 32:41.168
When you were away, I was...

32:41.203 --> 32:43.204
scared.

32:43.238 --> 32:45.506
And...

32:45.540 --> 32:48.843
lonely, and...

32:48.877 --> 32:50.912
Thayer was there for me.

32:50.946 --> 32:53.814
And neither of us meant
for it to happen, but

32:53.849 --> 32:56.216
we couldn't...

32:58.220 --> 33:00.621
Thayer and I slept together.

33:10.374 --> 33:12.708
I just think when it seems like
we're not on the same page,

33:12.742 --> 33:15.475
it sends a confusing message.
I understand, I get it.

33:15.595 --> 33:16.662
Knock-knock.

33:16.697 --> 33:18.240
Am I interrupting?

33:18.360 --> 33:20.065
No.
No, no, come sit.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.366
What do you know?

33:21.401 --> 33:22.868
She still lives here.

33:22.902 --> 33:24.536
I guess I lost that bet.

33:24.571 --> 33:27.072
(chuckles) I'm kidding.

33:27.107 --> 33:29.408
Can I make you some breakfast,
like an omelet, egg whites?

33:29.442 --> 33:30.675
No, thank you.

33:30.710 --> 33:33.645
I just want to apologize

33:33.679 --> 33:35.980
for not checking in with you guys.

33:36.015 --> 33:38.951
Well, yeah, we do... We do
need to know where you are,

33:38.985 --> 33:40.652
but we also appreciate that...

33:40.687 --> 33:43.288
That you understand that
that's an expectation.

33:43.322 --> 33:45.290
No, I do.

33:45.325 --> 33:48.694
But the other night,
I overheard you arguing,

33:48.728 --> 33:50.429
and I felt

33:50.463 --> 33:52.797
really bad.

33:52.832 --> 33:56.000
Sutton, it's o... it's okay for
couples to have disagreements.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.368
This was worse than that.

33:57.402 --> 34:00.337
You guys were fighting,
and you never fight.

34:00.371 --> 34:04.174
And I know it was because
of me and this trial, and...

34:04.208 --> 34:07.110
I don't want to do that to you.

34:07.144 --> 34:08.578
Honey, that-that wasn't
your fault.

34:08.612 --> 34:10.179
Your mother's right. Look,

34:10.214 --> 34:12.181
we should be apologizing
to you for the other night.

34:12.216 --> 34:14.516
I mean, we came on way
too strong; I did, especially.

34:14.551 --> 34:16.286
We both did,

34:16.320 --> 34:18.155
and we know how hard this it for you,

34:18.188 --> 34:20.158
and mostly, we just...
we want you to be happy.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.326
That's all we've ever wanted.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.527
We understand
your heart is with Ethan,

34:23.563 --> 34:25.397
and honestly, you were
right, we should have

34:25.431 --> 34:26.866
presumed he was innocent;
he deserves that.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.802
If you want us to be
with you at court,

34:28.835 --> 34:30.036
we will be there.

34:30.071 --> 34:32.639
Wow, thank you.
That means a lot.

34:32.674 --> 34:34.975
But you don't have to go to court.
Okay.

34:35.010 --> 34:39.447
I just... I really,
really love Ethan.

34:39.481 --> 34:42.116
And if we could have a relationship

34:42.150 --> 34:44.018
as strong as yours,

34:44.052 --> 34:46.654
how great would that be?

34:54.196 --> 34:56.163
I can't believe they're okay with it.

34:56.197 --> 34:57.731
I know, they were so cool.

34:57.766 --> 34:59.800
They even offered to go
to Ethan's arraignment with me.

34:59.834 --> 35:00.934
Ew.

35:00.969 --> 35:02.536
I know, but it was nice

35:02.570 --> 35:03.737
that they offered.

35:03.771 --> 35:05.272
That's so weird, though.

35:05.306 --> 35:07.541
They were acting so 1950s
strict the other night.

35:07.575 --> 35:09.042
Who knows?

35:09.076 --> 35:10.943
Maybe they knew I wasn't
gonna back down on this

35:10.978 --> 35:14.113
and thought it wasn't worth the battle.
Hmm.

35:14.147 --> 35:15.614
LAUREL: Baz, wait up.

35:17.050 --> 35:19.118
So, guess who's gonna be joining

35:19.152 --> 35:21.253
the band at Coachella 2012?

35:21.288 --> 35:22.888
Get out.

35:22.923 --> 35:24.790
Oh, I'm totally stoked!

35:24.824 --> 35:26.625
How did the elders
finally come around?

35:26.659 --> 35:30.128
Maybe they knew I was
not gonna back down on this.

35:30.162 --> 35:32.697
Wasn't worth the battle.

35:32.732 --> 35:34.532
Hardball. I like it.

35:34.567 --> 35:37.402
And by the way, if you have any
nervousness about the travel

35:37.437 --> 35:38.971
or, like, accommodations or whatever,

35:39.005 --> 35:40.373
you can relax.

35:40.407 --> 35:41.808
I have no intention
of taking advantage

35:41.842 --> 35:43.476
of your newly-
broken-up status.

35:43.511 --> 35:46.713
No intention of taking
advantage how exactly?

35:46.748 --> 35:48.148
Oh, you know.

35:48.183 --> 35:50.818
Like the old
movie-theater yawn

35:50.852 --> 35:53.287
turns into an arm around you.

35:53.321 --> 35:55.822
Or the "I'm-late-
for-class, see you"

35:55.857 --> 35:57.424
suddenly becomes a little gratuitous

35:57.458 --> 35:58.825
peck on the cheek.

35:58.859 --> 36:00.326
Like so.

36:01.995 --> 36:04.796
Well, I am late for class.

36:04.831 --> 36:07.032
See ya.

36:17.342 --> 36:18.776
REBECCA: Thank you
for the breakfast invitation.

36:18.811 --> 36:20.311
ALEC: Hey, I'm glad we were able

36:20.346 --> 36:22.480
to clear things up
before the arraignment today.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.983
I'm sorry that I
doubted you last night.

36:25.017 --> 36:26.818
It's all right.

36:26.853 --> 36:27.986
It's totally understandable.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.187
It's pretty crazy stuff.

36:29.222 --> 36:30.455
Yeah.

36:30.490 --> 36:33.291
Important thing to learn
is not to panic.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.694
Well, I feel a lot better
about things now.

36:35.728 --> 36:37.362
I'm glad to hear it.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.398
(phone chirps)

36:43.971 --> 36:45.772
What's up?

36:45.806 --> 36:46.812
Nothing.

36:46.932 --> 36:49.906
It's just a shoe sale or
something; I'm on some list.

36:50.026 --> 36:51.106
Shoe sale?

36:52.106 --> 36:54.212
I could use a new pair of wing tips.

37:10.691 --> 37:12.825
Okay, clearly, it's a prank.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.732
It's a setup; it's got to be.

37:14.852 --> 37:17.063
Why would they send it to you?
How should I know?

37:17.131 --> 37:18.664
Why aren't we calling the police?

37:18.699 --> 37:20.633
Do that reverse dial thing
you do, will you?

37:20.667 --> 37:22.135
Do that again.
I've done it like five times.

37:22.169 --> 37:23.936
It's disconnected;
there's no point.

37:23.970 --> 37:26.372
Well, clearly, somebody's playing me.

37:28.675 --> 37:30.210
But who?

37:30.244 --> 37:31.744
It can't be Dan;
he's not smart enough.

37:35.782 --> 37:37.249
Why didn't you tell me that you were

37:37.284 --> 37:39.017
at the scene of the crime that night?

37:39.052 --> 37:41.353
You never asked.

37:41.387 --> 37:44.022
Look, I didn't want
to muddy the investigation.

37:44.056 --> 37:45.257
That's it.

37:45.291 --> 37:46.891
It's muddy now.

37:49.628 --> 37:51.997
Okay.

37:52.031 --> 37:53.632
I was there.

37:53.667 --> 37:55.802
Derek Rogers

37:55.836 --> 37:58.706
had left me five or six
text messages that afternoon,

37:58.740 --> 38:01.075
saying it was
a life-and-death emergency.

38:01.109 --> 38:02.210
He had to see me.

38:02.244 --> 38:04.379
I went down there
to talk to him about it,

38:04.413 --> 38:06.715
he denied ever sending
any text at all.

38:06.749 --> 38:08.383
He started getting all shaky.

38:08.418 --> 38:10.552
He said that Ethan Whitehorse
had attacked him that afternoon.

38:10.586 --> 38:13.555
I grabbed him by the shirt,
and I told him to knock it off.

38:13.589 --> 38:14.723
Keep me out of it.

38:14.757 --> 38:17.258
But that was it.

38:20.062 --> 38:23.297
So, why are you holding the tire iron?

38:23.331 --> 38:25.899
Am I on trial here?

38:25.934 --> 38:28.168
I told you what happened.

38:28.202 --> 38:29.736
He said that Ethan came down there

38:29.771 --> 38:31.705
and had attacked him.

38:31.739 --> 38:33.040
Now, when I got down there,

38:33.074 --> 38:35.043
I saw him with the tire iron
in his hand,

38:35.077 --> 38:36.978
and I took it away from him;
I disarmed him.

38:37.013 --> 38:39.147
When Ethan came back,
he must have picked it up

38:39.182 --> 38:40.716
and used it to bash Derek's head in.

38:40.751 --> 38:42.151
You're so sure

38:42.185 --> 38:43.186
of everything.

38:43.220 --> 38:45.655
But how would they know?
Know what?

38:45.690 --> 38:47.157
About the murder weapon.

38:47.191 --> 38:49.393
We haven't released
that information to the public.

38:49.427 --> 38:51.128
So, how would they know?

38:51.163 --> 38:52.330
We're not calling the police,

38:52.364 --> 38:54.265
Why?

38:54.299 --> 38:57.401
'Cause the arraignment's today.

38:57.436 --> 38:58.937
Baby, we can't risk this.

38:58.971 --> 39:00.705
Your prints are probably
all over that thing.

39:00.739 --> 39:03.141
You know, if-if this...
if this gets out...

39:06.412 --> 39:08.313
Damn it.

39:11.984 --> 39:13.751
I'm sorry,

39:13.786 --> 39:15.120
I-I have to ask you this,

39:15.154 --> 39:18.123
and... and I promise I'll
never bring it up again,

39:18.157 --> 39:21.327
but I... I need you
to be honest with me.

39:22.729 --> 39:25.331
Did you kill Derek Rogers?

39:30.938 --> 39:32.205
Nervous?

39:32.239 --> 39:33.439
Oh, terrified.

39:33.473 --> 39:35.140
What if he gets denied bail

39:35.175 --> 39:36.942
and is thrown in jail indefinitely?

39:36.976 --> 39:38.977
These things have a way
of working themselves out.

39:39.011 --> 39:41.813
Sometimes, you just
have to be patient.

39:41.848 --> 39:43.315
Wait long enough,

39:43.349 --> 39:44.949
and your day will come.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.018
Come on.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.891
JUDGE: Are you certain this is
how you want to proceed,

39:52.925 --> 39:54.559
Mr. District Attorney?

39:54.593 --> 39:56.795
Ms. Lopez?

40:00.667 --> 40:02.435
Will the defendant

40:02.469 --> 40:04.871
please stand?

40:08.142 --> 40:10.844
In the matter of
<i>People v. Whitehorse,</i>

40:10.879 --> 40:12.780
the case is dismissed
for insufficient evidence.

40:12.814 --> 40:14.581
(gallery gasps)

40:14.616 --> 40:15.783
Bailiff,

40:15.817 --> 40:18.885
release the defendant.

40:18.919 --> 40:19.853
Well, Mr. Whitehorse,

40:19.887 --> 40:21.788
looks like you're free to go.

40:21.822 --> 40:23.356
(gavel bangs)

40:23.390 --> 40:24.357
Thank you.

40:24.391 --> 40:25.859
You're welcome.

40:25.893 --> 40:27.694
You did it; I don't know how,
but you did it.

40:27.728 --> 40:29.296
Thank you.

40:29.330 --> 40:31.198
Not so sure

40:31.232 --> 40:32.432
about that, Danny.

40:32.467 --> 40:34.201
I'm not so sure at all.

40:36.871 --> 40:38.238
What did I tell you?

40:38.273 --> 40:41.908
Sometimes an older person knows best.

40:51.386 --> 40:53.421
Can you give me a ride home?

40:56.659 --> 40:58.260
Yeah.

41:06.269 --> 41:08.069
What was that about?

41:13.108 --> 41:15.009
Well, maybe Ethan was overwhelmed

41:15.044 --> 41:17.946
by the moment, and that's
why he was distant.

41:17.980 --> 41:20.415
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

41:20.449 --> 41:22.651
I'm here if you need me.

41:27.723 --> 41:29.724
(sighs)

41:30.759 --> 41:33.194
Hey, sis.

41:33.228 --> 41:35.397
What are you doing here?

41:35.431 --> 41:38.233
Well...

41:38.267 --> 41:41.870
I heard how weird Ethan was to you

41:41.904 --> 41:43.271
at the courthouse,

41:43.306 --> 41:45.674
and I think I know why.

41:45.708 --> 41:48.010
I was really hoping Ethan and I...

41:48.044 --> 41:50.245
could put this behind us,

41:50.279 --> 41:52.447
but obviously...

41:52.481 --> 41:54.750
(sighing):
Oh, man, this is hard.

41:54.784 --> 41:56.518
Just say it.

41:56.552 --> 42:01.790
I don't know why it happened...

42:01.824 --> 42:06.094
but one night, we lit a fire,

42:06.128 --> 42:08.130
and...

42:08.164 --> 42:10.532
got cozy.

42:10.567 --> 42:13.135
And we were talking,

42:13.169 --> 42:16.839
and one thing led to another, and...

42:19.042 --> 42:21.110
Ethan and I slept together.

42:23.580 --> 42:25.214
I know.

42:25.248 --> 42:27.716
Ouch, right?

42:27.751 --> 42:30.419
I was really hoping that
we could get past this.

42:30.453 --> 42:32.755
I mean, after all,

42:32.789 --> 42:35.324
we're sisters.

42:35.358 --> 42:40.272
