00:03.320 --> 00:07.319
Hi. You look nice.

00:08.720 --> 00:09.919
What was that?

00:09.920 --> 00:13.159
If you care then why did you
fuck my best friend? Mins!

00:13.160 --> 00:16.639
When did it all get so fucking hard?

00:16.640 --> 00:18.159
That's what happens.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.479
Guess what I just did.

00:19.480 --> 00:20.599
With Grace?

00:20.600 --> 00:22.239
Of course with Grace!

00:22.240 --> 00:23.639
You're actually all right.

00:23.640 --> 00:24.719
Yeah?

00:24.720 --> 00:27.239
I'm all right?

00:27.240 --> 00:31.239
I love you quite a bit, Rich.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.319
Morning.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.879
Uh.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.879
Oh, my God! We're at my house!

01:45.880 --> 01:47.239
Why are we at my house?

01:47.240 --> 01:49.519
Er, we came here
cos it was closer or something.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.079
Rich, you can't be here - my dad!

01:58.440 --> 02:00.279
- Hurry up, Rich, come on!
- I'm trying.

02:00.280 --> 02:04.279
Grace, you're going to be
late.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.879
Stay behind me and be quiet.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.279
- Are you coming with me?
- No. Dad drives me every day.

02:10.280 --> 02:14.279
Fine.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.839
- I'll see you in college.
- Shit! It's locked.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.999
There's only one other way.
You'll have to go out
the back through the kitchen.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.919
- And Rich... I trust you, OK?
- OK.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.199
Fuck!

02:47.720 --> 02:48.959
What the fuck?

02:48.960 --> 02:51.479
He's your dad?
Why didn't you tell me?

02:51.480 --> 02:55.479
I'll explain later,
just don't let them see you.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.599
- It's the only way out.
- Are you fucking crazy?

02:59.760 --> 03:02.359
Now go!

03:25.840 --> 03:29.839
- Morning, dear.
- All right, princess?

03:30.080 --> 03:32.239
You look a bit peaky.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.839
Actually, I'm not feeling too
great...

03:34.840 --> 03:38.759
Maybe I'm sick or something.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.759
Um... Dad, why don't you
come over here and feel my head too?

03:50.760 --> 03:53.839
Feels all right to me.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.519
Are you sure you're getting
enough iron in your diet?

03:56.520 --> 03:59.679
Maybe not. I...

03:59.680 --> 04:03.039
Um...

04:03.040 --> 04:07.039
Check her head again, David.

04:07.640 --> 04:11.559
Who on earth is in the garden?

04:11.560 --> 04:15.439
Help me! Please! Get off me!

04:15.440 --> 04:19.439
Burke! Down.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.478
Burke!

04:21.480 --> 04:23.839
You remember Rich from college?

04:23.840 --> 04:25.479
Er...

04:25.480 --> 04:28.879
Erm... Hi.

04:28.880 --> 04:32.879
Well, um... I'd best be off now.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.959
Side gate unlocked? Great.
See you later, then.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.079
He seems nice.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.199
- Your drop-off point.
- Dad.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.079
I can explain.

05:01.080 --> 05:05.079
There's no need. I think
our little experiment may be over.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.159
It's time you returned to Mayberry's
College For Young Ladies.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.959
No! You can't send me back there!
It's in the middle of nowhere

05:12.960 --> 05:15.199
and everyone's horrible
and smells of horses!

05:15.200 --> 05:17.679
This place is bad for you.

05:17.680 --> 05:21.679
These... friends I see you with,
they distract you from your studies.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.239
But you don't know Rich.

05:24.240 --> 05:28.079
Or my friends!
And I get As for everything!

05:28.080 --> 05:29.919
Everything!

05:29.920 --> 05:33.719
Grace, calm down, please.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.159
How about this?

05:36.160 --> 05:37.959
You may live your life as you want.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.319
But the moment - the moment -

05:40.320 --> 05:43.599
you achieve a grade less than an A,

05:43.600 --> 05:47.599
starting with your AS drama
examination, you will
return to Mayberry's College.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.279
O-OK.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.599
Good.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.599
Have a productive morning.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.159
- David bloody Blood?!
- Shh. He doesn't want people to
know.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.199
Why not?

06:23.200 --> 06:25.999
He thinks it will compromise his
position if people know

06:26.000 --> 06:28.879
he has a daughter in college.
He made me promise.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.119
So you just did what he said
and didn't even tell me?

06:31.120 --> 06:35.119
He's my dad. I didn't have a choice.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.479
We're late for rehearsal.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.439
Andrew Aguecheek.

06:43.440 --> 06:47.439
Come on.

06:50.640 --> 06:54.639
Give me my veil.
Come, throw it o'er my face!

06:56.240 --> 06:59.039
We'll once more hear Orsino's
embassy.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.919
The honourable lady of the house,
which is she?

07:02.920 --> 07:04.439
Speak to me...

07:04.440 --> 07:07.599
OK, hold it there.
We're going to skip down a few scenes

07:07.600 --> 07:09.359
and come back to you later.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.039
Mini, sit down.

07:11.040 --> 07:15.039
Matty, we'll do Act IV Scene II.

07:31.520 --> 07:35.279
Thine eye hath
Stay'd upon some favour that it
loves

07:35.280 --> 07:38.559
Hath it not, boy?

07:38.560 --> 07:40.399
A little, by your favour.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.199
Remember, Franky,
you're talking about him.

07:43.200 --> 07:47.199
You're completely in love.

07:51.040 --> 07:55.039
What kind of woman is't?

08:10.280 --> 08:14.279
- Of your complexion.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.559
Actually, Grace, we need to talk.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.199
- Can't it wait?
- No. Matty and I have decided

08:22.200 --> 08:25.959
- we don't want to be in the play.
- What?

08:25.960 --> 08:29.959
- But you're the leads! We need you.
- Not really bothered. Right?

08:34.360 --> 08:36.958
Sorry, yeah?

08:36.960 --> 08:40.958
Hey, I'm still Toby Belch, right?
Cos I learnt all the fucking lines!

08:44.600 --> 08:46.959
Liv... Please!

08:46.960 --> 08:49.519
You can't do this.
I need this play to work.

08:49.520 --> 08:53.519
I've got to get an A. It's really,
really, really important.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.559
I'm just... I'm not feeling the
love.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.919
From Mini, Franky or you.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.079
I think you're all still
fucked off with me for what I did.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.919
No! We're not!

09:03.920 --> 09:06.719
It's fine! Everybody's over it.
We're all good.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.079
Listen, come over mine tonight.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.519
Let me prove it.
We'll do a girls' night in.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.519
It'll be just like old times.
You'll feel the love.

09:15.520 --> 09:19.519
I promise. It'll be magic.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.799
Enter.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.319
Ah. Grace.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.679
What can I do for you?

09:44.680 --> 09:47.759
I was wondering if I could have
some friends round tonight?

09:47.760 --> 09:48.879
Out of the question.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.519
Why? Because education is war?

09:51.520 --> 09:53.759
Education is war,
against inefficiency,

09:53.760 --> 09:56.639
ignorance, idleness and chewing gum.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.839
And our relationship
must remain secret.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.879
But you're my dad.
And you've got to meet my friends.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.359
That's what you do.
They won't tell anyone.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.959
And Rich already knows.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.959
Dad, I want to have my friends
round for tea, and that's that!

10:11.520 --> 10:13.559
Fine.

10:13.560 --> 10:17.119
But they must not breathe a word
of what they see or hear.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.839
And Rich?

10:18.840 --> 10:21.559
I want him to come to dinner.

10:21.560 --> 10:22.999
Yes. I will meet him too.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.519
Oh, thanks, Dad! Thanks so much!

10:25.520 --> 10:27.239
You're going to love him.

10:27.240 --> 10:31.239
Grace...
Remember, to stay, we must get As.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.719
Hello, everyone.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.399
We've got two days till the exam
and we're still not ready.

10:41.400 --> 10:45.399
So can I have Mini and Franky up
here to run through Act I Scene V?

10:50.200 --> 10:53.879
'Performing Shakespeare'smore
than reading words from a script,

10:53.880 --> 10:54.959
'It's about catharsis.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.959
'The outpouring of emotion
you feel as the play finishes.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.559
'A play is a promise
to deliver that.

11:04.560 --> 11:08.559
'And the only way to make sure
that happens is to always remember

11:08.880 --> 11:12.319
'the most important thing
about Shakespeare...

11:12.320 --> 11:15.799
'that he knows more about you
than you do.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.799
'You've got to let his wisdom
fill your soul.

11:20.400 --> 11:24.399
'He makes us better people.'

11:28.280 --> 11:32.279
That is your record
of academic achievement.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.839
Plus a couple of other things.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.959
Your father's employment record,

11:36.960 --> 11:40.239
including the results
of his last appraisal.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.719
It's not, as you can see, glowing.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.319
How did you get this?

11:44.320 --> 11:48.319
That's unimportant. I can tell
from that information that your life,

11:48.360 --> 11:52.359
just like your father's, will add up
to very little. Very little indeed.

11:53.480 --> 11:57.439
So what?
I can make things easier for you.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.519
I can make them easier
for your father. I know people.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.759
And I will not be a principal
forever.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.959
What are you talking about?

12:05.960 --> 12:09.959
These drama examinations
are externally moderated.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.999
I cannot influence the result.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.999
But if someone who I am told
is very good on stage

12:19.880 --> 12:23.839
were, say, to perform very badly...

12:23.840 --> 12:27.359
on purpose...

12:27.360 --> 12:30.519
You want Grace to fail
her examination.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.599
Why?

12:33.600 --> 12:37.519
Because, Richard,
she is too good for you.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.719
Now. I trust that
you will you do what I ask?

12:40.720 --> 12:42.999
She's not for you, Richard.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.559
She's my little girl.

12:45.560 --> 12:49.559
See you tonight.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.799
Um... This is really good, Mrs
Blood. What do you call it again?

13:26.600 --> 13:30.119
Chicken.

13:30.120 --> 13:34.119
Yeah, of course. Chicken.

13:38.760 --> 13:42.439
So are you enjoying
performing Shakespeare, Richard?

13:42.440 --> 13:44.519
Rich is really good playing
Aguecheek.

13:44.520 --> 13:48.519
Really funny. Reminds me of
a young, not-black Sidney Poitier.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.959
Er, yeah.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.959
So, Richard, tell me...
What does your father do?

13:57.680 --> 14:00.719
Rich's dad works
in the civil service.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.039
Oh, really?

14:03.040 --> 14:05.559
How... conscientious of him.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.119
Not really.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.799
Er, Mum.
Could you please pass the peas?

14:10.800 --> 14:14.799
Of course, dear.

14:17.520 --> 14:21.519
Do you remember the pea song
from that holiday in France?

14:21.640 --> 14:22.879
And that silly waiter?

14:43.640 --> 14:47.359
Again, again!

14:47.360 --> 14:50.759
I really, really, really need
a cigarette.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.159
You did really well.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.719
Did you see the way
your dad was looking at me?

14:53.720 --> 14:56.439
That's just his way!
He likes you, honestly.

14:56.440 --> 14:57.999
We're very different, Grace.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.479
Well, maybe our parents are.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.999
No, I mean... You're different
with them. You're not you.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.999
Grace! Your friends are here!

15:12.320 --> 15:14.719
Woo! Girls' night in!

15:14.720 --> 15:18.719
Grace, I'll see you later, yeah?

15:21.120 --> 15:22.399
Ladies.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.599
So, you've met Mum.

15:25.600 --> 15:29.239
And now you can meet me.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.079
Professor Blood?

15:31.080 --> 15:34.439
What are you doing at Grace's house?

15:34.440 --> 15:37.279
Because her house is also my house.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.919
I am her father.

15:38.920 --> 15:42.559
I asked Grace to keep this a secret,
and now I ask you all

15:42.560 --> 15:46.199
to keep it a secret too.
Will you do that?

15:46.200 --> 15:48.319
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:48.320 --> 15:52.319
Remember, please, ladies...

15:57.120 --> 15:58.879
Have fun.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.599
I'm sorry I didn't tell you guys.
He made me promise.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.799
Jesus Christ.

16:04.800 --> 16:08.399
What other secrets do you have,
Grace? If that is even
your real name.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.039
Cool bird.

16:10.040 --> 16:13.519
Are you the secret love child
of Wayne Rooney and Susan Boyle?

16:13.520 --> 16:16.599
Hey... are you even a girl?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.519
Do you have a little winky, Grace?

16:18.520 --> 16:19.959
Please don't hate me.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.359
Don't worry about it.

16:22.360 --> 16:26.359
My sister's in prison,
and I don't exactly go around
telling everyone about it.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.999
Anyway... let's get fucked up.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.479
I brought you a present.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.039
What's that?

16:33.040 --> 16:34.479
It's coke.

16:34.480 --> 16:38.119
Want to try it? It'll be fun!

16:38.120 --> 16:40.039
Have you any idea
how much this sounds like

16:40.040 --> 16:42.399
the beginning of
an episode of Casualty?

16:42.400 --> 16:44.599
Liv! We should rehearse.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.719
Aah. Why bother?
This'll be much more fun.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.839
Grace is right. We're still not
ready.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.679
Or at least, some elements aren't.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.319
Really? What "elements"
would those be, Mini?

16:56.320 --> 16:59.199
You know. This and that.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.959
OK! Let's all do cocaine!

17:06.119 --> 17:09.279
The reason I know that this will be
awesome is you're all so much

17:09.280 --> 17:11.279
ike your characters in the play.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.759
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.598
Liv, you're playing Olivia, right?

17:15.599 --> 17:19.598
She's beautiful, desired by all,
but she's also really vulnerable.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.398
What's Franky's story, then?

17:24.400 --> 17:28.398
I can do this one. Franky is Viola.

17:28.720 --> 17:32.719
The girl dressed as a boy
who can't get what she wants...

17:32.840 --> 17:34.119
Whatever that is.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.999
I know what I want.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.279
And what's that?

17:38.280 --> 17:39.919
What's what?

17:39.920 --> 17:41.719
Well...

17:41.720 --> 17:45.719
Franky, you haven't really told us
whether you're a...

17:46.720 --> 17:49.439
you know... or a...

17:49.440 --> 17:50.999
A what or a what?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.359
A lesbian.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.199
Liv! That's so...

17:54.200 --> 17:56.279
No.

17:56.280 --> 18:00.279
It's OK, I don't mind.

18:00.600 --> 18:04.599
And the answer is... no.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.399
I'm not anything.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.359
So you're a bisexual?

18:10.360 --> 18:14.359
No. I'm... into people.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.559
Who are you into at the moment?

18:20.960 --> 18:22.319
Well...

18:22.320 --> 18:26.319
Woo! I love this track!
Everyone dance! Dance with me!

18:54.080 --> 18:55.919
Shit!
Grace!

18:55.920 --> 18:57.319
What are you doing in there?

18:57.320 --> 18:58.359
Hide the stuff!

18:58.360 --> 19:00.959
You know I don't like locked doors
in my house, Grace. Come out!

19:00.960 --> 19:04.479
Coming, Dad.

19:04.480 --> 19:08.119
Sorry, Professor Blood.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.519
I'm going to walk them home, Dad.

19:10.520 --> 19:14.519
All of them?

19:17.240 --> 19:21.239
Don't wait up.

19:39.600 --> 19:43.559
We should do cocaine every day!
It's marvellous!

19:43.560 --> 19:46.199
Where are all the fucking men!?

19:46.200 --> 19:50.199
I think you scared them away
when you did the Macarena to Rustie.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.479
There's some.

19:53.480 --> 19:57.479
Come on, Franky.
Let's get your balls wet.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.319
No... It's OK. You go.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.959
Yeah. You go, Mini.
We'll stay here and watch.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.719
Franky likes to watch.
Don't you, Franky?

20:07.720 --> 20:09.879
OK. Let's go.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.119
Franky likes to watch?

20:12.120 --> 20:16.119
It is all good, baby!
Let's get crunked!

20:16.720 --> 20:20.719
So, Liv. Are you back in the play?
Please say yes.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.919
Yeah, I think so.

20:23.920 --> 20:27.039
I knew you wouldn't let me down!
Thanks, Liv.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.999
Don't worry about it.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.279
Guess who.

20:31.280 --> 20:32.319
Rich!

20:32.320 --> 20:36.239
Of all the pretentious student nights
in all of Bristol,

20:36.240 --> 20:39.359
you had to choose this one.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.959
You're pissed.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.799
How dare you!

20:42.800 --> 20:46.799
I've only had seven drinks
and they were teeny tiny little
dwarfy drinks.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.239
What's going on?

20:55.240 --> 20:59.239
Mini and Franky
are trying to get laid.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.399
What - by them?

21:00.400 --> 21:04.399
I think they're considering it.

21:04.560 --> 21:08.559
Matty, no. They're having
a good time, just leave it.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.279
You are such a fucking dick...

21:27.280 --> 21:31.279
Rich. Oh, God, what do I do, Rich?

21:32.360 --> 21:33.639
Rich?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.559
Shhh!

21:35.560 --> 21:37.119
Rich!

21:42.400 --> 21:46.399
Rich? Oh, Rich, no!

21:53.280 --> 21:57.279
Come on. I'll take you home.

21:59.280 --> 22:03.279
Ooh, you're heavy.

22:12.640 --> 22:16.639
Shush, Rich.

22:18.320 --> 22:21.479
Uh... I'm all right, Grace.

22:21.480 --> 22:24.719
Cos I've got you to look after me.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.239
It's what you do!

22:27.240 --> 22:30.119
Everyone's happy when Grace is
around.

22:30.120 --> 22:33.879
You're a shape-shifter of happiness.

22:33.880 --> 22:37.879
What are you talking about?
You're not making any sense.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.919
I don't know who you are!

22:40.920 --> 22:42.839
Are you Grace Violet or Grace Blood?

22:42.840 --> 22:44.879
Are you daddy's girl

22:44.880 --> 22:47.479
or my girl?

22:59.040 --> 23:03.039
I'm who I need to be, Rich.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.919
We all are.

23:05.920 --> 23:09.679
Haven't you heard the saying
"all the world's a stage"?

23:09.680 --> 23:13.679
Yeah. But it's not true, is it?

23:17.280 --> 23:21.279
I'm going home.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.999
Rich. Tell me why you're unhappy.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.999
Hey. All the world's a stage, right?

23:29.040 --> 23:33.039
So none of this matters.
Doesn't matter at all.

23:53.840 --> 23:57.359
That's not a happy face, Gracie!

23:57.360 --> 23:59.879
What's the matter, sweetheart?

23:59.880 --> 24:03.199
Basically? All my friends
have fallen out,

24:03.200 --> 24:05.839
which means the play
isn't going to work, which means

24:05.840 --> 24:07.119
I won't get an A for drama,

24:07.120 --> 24:09.919
which means Dad is going to
send me back to Mayberry's.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.639
I found this when
I was cleaning your room.

24:12.640 --> 24:14.799
It's the one I used to read you.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.679
Rapunzel was always your favourite.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.159
But what's that...

24:19.160 --> 24:21.359
Rapunzel had to let down her hair
so the prince could climb up.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.599
So what's that
got to do with anything?

24:24.600 --> 24:26.799
It's got everything to do
with everything, Grace.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.319
So what do I do?

24:28.320 --> 24:31.559
You get them on that stage no
matter what. You are the director.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.839
Take control and be creative.
Make a happy ending.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.119
How?

24:37.120 --> 24:41.119
Let down your hair, princess.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.399
Do not extort thy reasons
from this clause

24:44.400 --> 24:48.399
For, that I woo,
therefore hast no clause

24:48.680 --> 24:52.679
But rather reason thus
than reason fetter

24:53.560 --> 24:57.519
Love sought is good,
but given unsought is better.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.719
By innocence I swear...

24:59.720 --> 25:03.719
Hold on. I've had an idea.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.519
Kiss her.

25:08.520 --> 25:12.519
Um... There's nothing
about kissing in the... script.

25:12.680 --> 25:16.679
You're meant to interpret
Shakespeare. Try it!

25:21.440 --> 25:25.439
Um, but... Um, but rather
reason thus than reason fetter

25:28.000 --> 25:31.999
Love sought is good,
but given unsought is better.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.679
Fine.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.319
Am I doing OK?

25:50.320 --> 25:53.199
You're doing fine.
And thanks for covering for Liv.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.919
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

25:54.920 --> 25:58.919
You're doing your best,
but we need Matty and Liv.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.879
After last night, I don't know
if they're going to come back.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.119
But they're our leads.
Without them...

26:04.120 --> 26:05.959
We're fucked.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.719
Let's take an hour's break.

26:08.720 --> 26:12.719
Thanks, everyone.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.679
Sorry about last night.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.599
That's OK.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.319
You were just drunk.

26:25.320 --> 26:29.319
I know you didn't mean
what you said.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.279
No, I'm sorry about being drunk,
but I...

26:33.280 --> 26:36.239
meant what I said.
What I can remember.

26:36.240 --> 26:39.839
What? All that stuff about me
being fake - you meant it?

26:39.840 --> 26:42.759
Not fake. I'm just saying
you're always performing.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.119
You're an actress, not a director.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.319
You're always playing the part

26:47.320 --> 26:49.799
of whoever the person you're with
needs you to be.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.879
So, fake, then.

26:52.880 --> 26:56.879
You always say that
you're made of stories.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.239
And you are.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.319
I don't understand
what's wrong with that.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.399
What's really going on, Rich?

27:02.400 --> 27:05.039
Nothing. Nothing.

27:05.040 --> 27:09.039
Come on. Say it.
Say what you're thinking.

27:09.720 --> 27:12.159
I don't know what we are.
I don't know if we're right.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.439
I know what's going on.

27:13.440 --> 27:16.279
You've met my parents
and now you're freaking out.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.119
Yeah, I am, actually. Yeah.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.639
Don't be such a girl.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.879
It's not like we're getting married!
It was one dinner!

27:21.880 --> 27:24.119
Yeah, one mental dinner.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.279
So...

27:26.280 --> 27:27.919
Shall we just not bother, then?

27:27.920 --> 27:29.599
Just screw all this?

27:29.600 --> 27:33.599
No! I don't know, Grace, I just...
I don't know what to do. About us.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.479
Go away, Rich.

27:38.480 --> 27:41.839
Go away now.

27:41.840 --> 27:45.839
Fine.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.599
Not bad, eh?

27:57.600 --> 28:00.919
This used to be a sports hall.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.199
Great acoustics, though.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.199
Want to try it out?

28:11.200 --> 28:12.279
Oh. No.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.599
It's brand-new.
It needs christening.

28:14.600 --> 28:18.599
Say some lines. Get a feel for it.

28:21.680 --> 28:23.599
To be, or not to be.

28:23.600 --> 28:27.319
Louder! Project! Fill the space!

28:27.320 --> 28:31.159
To be, or not to be,
that is the question.

28:31.160 --> 28:34.399
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind,
to suffer

28:34.400 --> 28:37.319
The slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune

28:37.320 --> 28:39.199
Or to take arms
against a sea of troubles

28:39.200 --> 28:42.079
And, by opposing, end them?

28:42.080 --> 28:46.079
To die? To sleep, no more.

28:51.880 --> 28:54.679
No.

28:54.680 --> 28:58.679
No. No fucking way. No fucking way!

28:59.280 --> 29:02.759
Grace? Are you OK?

29:02.760 --> 29:06.759
Absolutely fine.

29:09.920 --> 29:12.839
You're back in the play. Don't argue.
You're going to come

29:12.840 --> 29:15.879
and rehearse right now.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.239
Fine.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.679
Is Liv here?

29:19.680 --> 29:21.039
Can you see Liv?

29:21.040 --> 29:22.199
Where is she?

29:22.200 --> 29:24.839
I haven't seen her since last night.
She won't answer my calls,

29:24.840 --> 29:26.759
messenger, e-mails, nothing.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.999
Have you broken up?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.639
She's not talking to me.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.439
I don't think she trusts me.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.079
What sort of boyfriend are you?

29:34.080 --> 29:35.599
A bad one.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.719
OK? But I...

29:38.720 --> 29:42.599
But I love her, Grace.

29:42.600 --> 29:45.039
I really fucking love her.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.079
Come on, we need to rehearse.

29:48.080 --> 29:52.079
Your master quits you
and, for your service done him

29:52.320 --> 29:54.439
So much against the mettle
of your sex

29:54.440 --> 29:57.359
And since you've served me
for so long

29:57.360 --> 30:00.079
Here is my hand.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.079
You shall from this time be

30:10.080 --> 30:12.119
Your master's mistress.

30:28.120 --> 30:32.039
Matty, Franky,
you need to work on that kiss.

30:32.040 --> 30:36.039
But that's it for today, everyone.

30:37.600 --> 30:41.599
I'd better learn the rest
of Liv's part. I'll be fine.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.959
Get you to your lord!
I cannot love him

30:57.960 --> 30:59.759
Let him send no more

30:59.760 --> 31:03.759
Unless... perchance,

31:04.280 --> 31:08.279
you come to me again.

31:23.480 --> 31:27.479
What's going on, sweetheart? Tell
Mummy, and she'll make it better.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.439
I can't make it work!

31:29.440 --> 31:31.599
I can't make a happy ending.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.839
Why don't you imagine the look on
your dad's face when it does work?

31:34.840 --> 31:36.839
That's a reason to try.

31:36.840 --> 31:40.279
I'm trying so hard already.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.759
Then try harder, darling.

31:56.960 --> 31:59.799
Thought I'd find you here.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.439
You have to come back.

32:01.440 --> 32:02.959
What for?

32:02.960 --> 32:06.559
For Matty. For Mini.
For Franky. For me.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.759
For everything.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.799
What's the point? Me and Matty.
Me and Mini. Me and Franky.

32:12.800 --> 32:16.199
It's all fucked, Grace. I don't know
how to be with them any more.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.239
Yes, you do!

32:17.240 --> 32:21.239
I know you do. Just... be with them.

32:22.360 --> 32:25.399
What do you think of me, Grace?

32:25.400 --> 32:27.559
What I did,

32:27.560 --> 32:30.279
with Nick, with Mini?

32:30.280 --> 32:32.239
What do you think?

32:32.240 --> 32:34.319
I think everything
is going to be fine.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.199
Everyone is going to get
what they want.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.839
I promise you. I know it.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.919
How do you know that?

32:41.920 --> 32:45.119
Because it's the only thing
I believe in.

32:45.120 --> 32:49.119
Because it's the only thing
I've got left to count on.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.319
OK, everyone.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.399
I know it's been
a difficult morning,

33:37.400 --> 33:40.039
with all the last-minute changes
I've made.

33:40.040 --> 33:44.039
I want to thank you all
for everything you've put into this.

33:44.640 --> 33:47.999
I know it's been hard for everyone.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.479
But we're ready.

33:49.480 --> 33:53.479
So... let's show those motherfuckers
how this story ends.

33:59.160 --> 34:03.159
Positions, everyone!

34:08.400 --> 34:09.839
We need to talk.

34:09.840 --> 34:13.839
After, OK?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.679
I'm nervous, I'm nervous.

34:19.239 --> 34:23.239
Rich, mate,
I'm absolutely shitting myself.

34:23.679 --> 34:27.679
But rather reason thus
with reason fetter

34:27.719 --> 34:31.719
Love sought is good,
but given unsought is better.

34:40.719 --> 34:43.799
By innocence I swear,
and by my youth

34:43.800 --> 34:46.918
I have one heart,
one bosom and one truth.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.478
And that no woman has,
nor never none

34:49.480 --> 34:52.998
Shall mistress be of it,
save I alone.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.599
And so, adieu, good madam.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.999
Never more will I my master's tears
to you deplore.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.359
Yet come again, for thou,
perhaps mayst move

35:02.360 --> 35:06.359
That heart, which now abhors,
to like his love.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.919
No, faith, I'll not stay
a jot longer.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.399
Thy reason, dear venom.
Give thy reason.

35:27.400 --> 35:31.399
You must needs yield
your reason, Sir Andrew.

35:31.960 --> 35:35.959
Marry, I saw your niece
do more favours...

35:40.800 --> 35:42.359
You're a sick bastard,
do you know that?

35:42.360 --> 35:43.239
What do you mean?

35:43.240 --> 35:45.439
Me and her! It turned you on!

35:45.440 --> 35:47.199
Have you any idea how weird that is?

35:47.200 --> 35:49.599
You were kissing another girl.
Of course it turned me on.

35:49.600 --> 35:53.319
Guys! Shh! The play!

35:53.320 --> 35:56.959
Do you love her?

35:56.960 --> 35:58.439
What's going on?

35:58.440 --> 36:00.079
I love you.

36:00.080 --> 36:04.079
But do you love... her?

36:11.320 --> 36:14.119
I'm sure you'll be
very happy together.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.319
Whatever's going on...

36:16.320 --> 36:19.159
you can't go now.
You can't leave me.

36:19.160 --> 36:22.839
You told me it would all be OK.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.639
It will be! It will.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.999
We just have to finish.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.999
We just have to finish the play.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.559
You forget her.

36:39.560 --> 36:43.559
Now. OK?

36:53.760 --> 36:57.759
You're on in two. Come on.

36:57.960 --> 37:00.759
We need to finish.

37:00.760 --> 37:04.759
Just finish.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.759
Now heaven walks on earth.

37:11.760 --> 37:15.359
Three months hath
this youth tended upon me

37:15.360 --> 37:19.359
But more of that anon.

37:20.280 --> 37:24.279
Take him a... aside...

37:25.480 --> 37:29.479
What do you say, Cesario?

37:31.720 --> 37:35.719
Good, my lord?

37:41.560 --> 37:44.399
If it be aught to be
to the old tune, my lord

37:44.400 --> 37:48.399
It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
As howling after music.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.119
Woo-woo!

39:02.000 --> 39:04.559
They're just through there.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.239
That really was excellent, Grace.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.359
Really good, darling.

39:08.360 --> 39:12.359
But I have decided that you will be
returning to Mayberry's after all.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.239
What?

39:14.240 --> 39:16.639
What?! Fuck!

39:16.640 --> 39:20.159
Have some decorum, young lady.
You're not in Scotland!

39:20.160 --> 39:24.159
I did what you asked!
I did everything! I worked so hard!
Mum, say something!

39:25.280 --> 39:28.959
We wanted you to finish your
school year in a good place.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.839
Thanks so much!

39:30.840 --> 39:33.799
That makes it all fine!
The deal...

39:33.800 --> 39:37.399
was never a deal, was it? You were
always going to send me back.

39:37.400 --> 39:41.399
I'm doing this because I love you.
I just want better for you.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.079
No, David.

39:44.080 --> 39:48.079
You just want a different daughter.

39:50.240 --> 39:54.239
Grace... Grace!

39:54.280 --> 39:56.199
I'm going away, Rich.

39:56.200 --> 39:57.679
For good.

39:57.680 --> 39:58.799
But what about us?

39:58.800 --> 40:02.159
You were right, Rich. You were
totally right. I'm not real.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.799
Yes, you are. You're real to me.
I was a twat for saying...

40:04.800 --> 40:07.319
I'm a story. A character.

40:07.320 --> 40:10.119
A fucking fiction. But you're not.

40:10.120 --> 40:12.639
The others aren't.
My parents aren't.

40:12.640 --> 40:16.239
And I don't belong here.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.599
Where are you going?

40:17.600 --> 40:21.599
To a fucking castle in the clouds.

40:55.440 --> 40:59.439
I've brought you some supper.

41:06.520 --> 41:10.519
It kills me to see you
like this, Grace.

41:10.600 --> 41:14.599
Everything will work out OK.

41:17.120 --> 41:21.119
You know, you've spent my whole life
filling me with stories,

41:21.360 --> 41:23.919
things that aren't true,
were never true.

41:23.920 --> 41:27.919
You told me everything was going
to be OK as long as I tried.

41:28.520 --> 41:32.519
All these stories,
all these lies I believed.

41:34.080 --> 41:38.079
Great Expectations - lies.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.119
Sense And Sensibility - lies.

41:42.120 --> 41:46.119
I believed it all and now I'm
miserable. And it's your fault.

41:46.120 --> 41:50.119
And you can't fix it.

41:51.040 --> 41:55.039
I...

42:35.400 --> 42:37.679
Her eyes in heaven

42:37.680 --> 42:41.679
Would through the airy region
stream so bright...

42:43.760 --> 42:45.959
that birds would sing

42:45.960 --> 42:49.399
and think it were not night.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.159
But, soft!

42:52.160 --> 42:55.519
What light from
yonder window breaks?

42:55.520 --> 42:59.159
It is the east and
Juliet is the sun!

43:01.680 --> 43:05.399
See, how she leans her cheek
upon her hand!

43:05.400 --> 43:08.039
O, that I were a glove
upon that hand

43:08.040 --> 43:12.039
That I might touch that cheek!

43:12.680 --> 43:15.639
Rich? What are you doing?

43:15.640 --> 43:19.079
She speaks!
Speak again, bright angel.

43:19.080 --> 43:21.519
Be careful!

43:21.520 --> 43:22.719
For thou art

43:22.720 --> 43:26.439
as glorious to this night...

43:26.440 --> 43:28.919
being...

43:28.920 --> 43:31.559
Fuck me!

43:31.560 --> 43:35.559
as is a winged messenger
of... heaven.

43:52.240 --> 43:55.959
It is my lady, o, 'tis my love,

43:55.960 --> 43:58.839
O, that she knew she were...

43:58.840 --> 44:02.839
Be quiet. My parents will hear.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.799
Alack, there lies more peril
in thine eyes

44:10.800 --> 44:13.759
Than twenty of their swords!

44:13.760 --> 44:17.599
Very sweet, but this
can't happen, Rich.

44:17.600 --> 44:20.639
There's nothing
we can do, it's over.

44:20.640 --> 44:24.639
Oh, would'st thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

44:26.200 --> 44:30.199
Tell me. Tell me what to do,
what's left to do?

44:30.760 --> 44:34.279
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

44:34.280 --> 44:38.279
What do people in Shakespeare's
plays do when it's all fucked,

44:38.400 --> 44:42.079
when they're trapped?
How do they work it all out?

44:42.080 --> 44:45.319
Maybe stories are just stories,

44:45.320 --> 44:49.319
or maybe...

44:50.120 --> 44:52.479
we can makeourlife a story.

44:52.480 --> 44:56.479
So marry me, Grace Violet Blood.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.919
Oh, wonder

45:10.920 --> 45:13.359
How many goodly creatures
are there here!

45:13.360 --> 45:16.559
How beauteous mankind is!

45:16.560 --> 45:19.079
O brave new world

45:19.080 --> 45:23.079
That has such people in it.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.319
I do. Put it on, then.

45:54.320 --> 45:56.119
I do. Beautiful.

45:56.120 --> 45:57.359
Shit, my balls!

45:57.360 --> 46:01.359
I do, I do, I do!

46:01.880 --> 46:04.279
Matty?

46:04.280 --> 46:07.159
He just wants to fuck you
and then fuck you up!

46:07.160 --> 46:09.639
Good.

46:09.640 --> 46:13.279
You're a bit of a prick,
but peel away that prick,

46:13.280 --> 46:17.279
there's a good man in there.

46:18.200 --> 46:22.199
David fucking Blood!
