00:22.400 --> 00:25.365
- So who is he?
- Tom Pryce, 24 years old.

00:25.367 --> 00:27.966
I hear you found the body.

00:27.968 --> 00:29.499
Can I get your name?

00:29.501 --> 00:30.699
Amber Saunders.

00:30.701 --> 00:33.098
You can, um,
find me at the homeless shelter

00:33.100 --> 00:34.932
in Charing Cross.

00:34.934 --> 00:38.198
It's a suicide note.
Says he killed Tom Pryce.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.632
What you said in your note
about Tom Pryce.

00:40.634 --> 00:42.832
You said you killed him.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.632
- Is it true?
- I was lying.

00:44.634 --> 00:46.998
Recommend they charge
Perry Evans with murder.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.599
He's making a mistake.

00:48.601 --> 00:51.398
At the very least,
Perry Evans has an accomplice.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.832
I've just had Kirsten Pryce
on the phone.

00:53.834 --> 00:56.033
When we found her son Tom's
body, was he wearing a watch?

01:10.167 --> 01:12.532
DNA evidence taken
from inside the bag

01:12.534 --> 01:15.866
leads us to believe
that it belonged to your wife.

01:15.868 --> 01:19.098
The question is, how did it
end up at Tom Pryce's flat?

01:19.100 --> 01:24.065
Jamie said Tom had been in
his bedroom with some slapper.

01:24.067 --> 01:26.234
Tom swore
they didn't sleep together.

01:36.100 --> 01:36.934
Hi.

01:38.334 --> 01:39.799
Nice place.

01:39.801 --> 01:42.567
The boss' wife is missing,
and that's you with her bag.

01:43.133 --> 01:44.565
You're gonna need to
tell the team

01:44.567 --> 01:47.799
when you found it and where,
or I will.

01:47.801 --> 01:49.198
You know I've always thought

01:49.200 --> 01:50.998
there were two people involved
in that murder.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.734
I think Amber's one of them.

01:56.267 --> 01:59.100
Fine. I'll go.

02:32.100 --> 02:35.400
Hello?
I-I need an ambulance.

02:43.534 --> 02:45.432
<i>Hi. It's Billie.
Leave me a message.</i>

02:46.300 --> 02:48.065
Billie, it's me.

02:48.067 --> 02:51.767
Amber Saunders just became prime
suspect in the Tom Pryce murder.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.265
You're her VLO,

02:54.267 --> 02:57.499
so if anyone knows her,
it's you.

02:57.501 --> 02:58.799
I'm on my way to yours now.

02:58.801 --> 03:00.765
<i>All units, from control.</i>

03:00.767 --> 03:04.065
<i>Stabbing, Archer Road, EC1 2ZC.</i>

03:04.067 --> 03:05.398
<i>Ambulance en route.</i>

03:05.400 --> 03:06.799
Control from D.C. Brady.

03:06.801 --> 03:09.534
Immediate vicinity.
En route now.

03:21.534 --> 03:22.899
Police! Get out the way!
Get out the way!

03:22.901 --> 03:24.465
Police!
Out the way!

03:24.467 --> 03:26.934
Billie, can you hear me?

03:30.234 --> 03:32.065
Push that down hard
on that wound now.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.901
Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole.

03:55.334 --> 03:57.298
I need the misper team
to follow this up.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.966
This is the strongest lead
we've had

03:58.968 --> 04:01.966
since my wife disappeared
four months ago.

04:01.968 --> 04:04.265
Her handbag turned up
at a murder victim's flat.

04:04.267 --> 04:07.298
Now we know who put it there.

04:07.300 --> 04:10.267
Her name is Amber Saunders,
no fixed address.

04:12.968 --> 04:15.232
Boss, it's Billie.

04:15.234 --> 04:16.567
She's been stabbed.

04:32.801 --> 04:35.065
Billie's mother is listed
as the next of kin,

04:35.067 --> 04:37.198
and she's on holiday in Spain.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.332
Father?

04:38.334 --> 04:40.799
He was murdered in 2002.

04:40.801 --> 04:42.832
He intervened
in a street brawl.

04:42.834 --> 04:44.699
She kept that
close to her chest.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.332
She's full of surprises.

04:47.334 --> 04:51.665
There's no sign of forced entry
or a struggle.

04:51.667 --> 04:54.298
No, and I can't see
any blood splatter either,

04:54.300 --> 04:56.167
which means the attacker
was probably standing close.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.732
Billie drinks vodka and lime.

05:01.734 --> 05:04.966
These are mojitos.
They're premixed cocktails.

05:04.968 --> 05:07.067
Maybe whoever did this
brought them.

05:09.133 --> 05:12.167
I've got a till receipt for
Cabwell Street. The mini mart.

05:15.067 --> 05:16.734
Yeah.

05:20.701 --> 05:22.234
Vivienne.

05:24.701 --> 05:25.934
Look at this.

05:30.801 --> 05:33.198
It's Amber Saunders.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.601
What the hell was she doing
at Billie's flat?

05:37.501 --> 05:40.534
- I'm gonna have to take this.
- Okay.

05:41.934 --> 05:44.133
Thanks.
Be in touch.

05:47.467 --> 05:50.532
Get onto Transport for London.
Pull all their street CCTV.

05:50.534 --> 05:52.265
Piece together
Amber's movements.

05:52.267 --> 05:53.467
Boss.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.868
- How's Billie?
- No change.

07:19.767 --> 07:22.432
We tracked Amber Saunders
to Claypit Road,

07:22.434 --> 07:23.966
then we lost her.

07:23.968 --> 07:25.998
Morning, everyone.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.100
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.765
Prime suspect, I take it?

07:30.767 --> 07:33.665
Amber Saunders claimed
she found Tom Pryce's body

07:33.667 --> 07:35.599
but we now believe
she murdered him.

07:35.601 --> 07:37.866
I thought Perry Evans
admitted to that.

07:37.868 --> 07:40.432
Vivienne didn't buy it.
Looks like she was right.

07:40.434 --> 07:44.298
As you know, ma'am, my wife's
been missing for four months.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.434
Her handbag was recovered
from Tom Pryce's flat.

07:48.634 --> 07:53.000
This is Amber Saunders carrying
my wife's bag to the flat.

07:54.734 --> 07:58.198
If she's homeless,
she won't be easy to track down.

07:58.200 --> 08:02.567
We'll turn over every squat and
crack house until we find her.

08:03.567 --> 08:08.499
Look, David, if you'd rather
excuse yourself from the inquiry

08:08.501 --> 08:10.866
given the possible connection
to your wife's disappearance...

08:10.868 --> 08:12.665
I'm fine.

08:12.667 --> 08:15.165
Vivienne did an excellent job
as acting...

08:15.167 --> 08:17.599
I was worried that David had
come back too soon,

08:17.601 --> 08:21.031
but he's proved
that he can be objective.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.367
I think he should run this.

08:24.834 --> 08:26.332
Okay.

08:26.334 --> 08:27.367
Fine.

08:29.167 --> 08:30.432
Keep me up to speed, yeah?

08:30.434 --> 08:32.634
Ma'am.

08:35.501 --> 08:37.234
You had a bang
on the head, Sarge?

08:38.234 --> 08:40.299
I-I screwed up.

08:41.634 --> 08:43.732
Billie's stabbing.

08:43.734 --> 08:45.701
I could have prevented it.

08:56.567 --> 08:58.699
Billie must have
recognized Amber

08:58.701 --> 09:01.365
with your wife's bag
on the CCTV.

09:01.367 --> 09:02.699
So why keep that to herself?

09:02.701 --> 09:07.765
Well, she talked to me
about a-a friend

09:07.767 --> 09:09.899
that was mixed up
with a witness.

09:09.901 --> 09:11.599
And what did you say?

09:11.601 --> 09:15.298
Well, obviously she was
talking about herself, but I...

09:15.300 --> 09:16.966
I didn't want to go there,

09:16.968 --> 09:20.198
so I... I told her
to tell the friend

09:20.200 --> 09:22.599
to shut the relationship down.

09:22.601 --> 09:25.065
You didn't know Amber
was going to stab her.

09:25.067 --> 09:26.799
This isn't your fault.

09:26.801 --> 09:28.067
You reckon?

09:29.067 --> 09:30.968
Billie needed your help.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.832
You're right.
I...

09:35.834 --> 09:37.300
I'm sorry.

09:51.701 --> 09:54.400
Boss, we've narrowed down
a possible location.

09:56.367 --> 09:57.899
These are the calls
Amber made to Perry

09:57.901 --> 09:59.866
on the night of Pryce's murder.

09:59.868 --> 10:01.932
They were all bounced
by the same phone mast.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.400
We'll take my car.

10:36.434 --> 10:37.765
Anything?

10:37.767 --> 10:39.400
No, I didn't get
any hits at all.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.565
She recognizes Amber.

10:43.567 --> 10:44.966
She lives in Braewell Court.

10:44.968 --> 10:46.866
Flats up there
must cost a mint.

10:46.868 --> 10:48.899
So she's not homeless, then?

10:48.901 --> 10:50.265
Right.

10:50.267 --> 10:52.200
No more messing about.

11:01.801 --> 11:03.799
- Police!
- Armed police!

11:03.801 --> 11:04.866
Police! Show yourself!

11:04.868 --> 11:06.534
Police! Police!

11:14.501 --> 11:16.400
In here!

11:18.067 --> 11:19.899
Stop! Police!

11:19.901 --> 11:20.899
Come here.

11:20.901 --> 11:22.334
Okay! Okay!

11:23.601 --> 11:25.234
Don't resist.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.899
Detective Inspector Bradford.
Who are you?

11:29.901 --> 11:31.332
Asif Bapary.

11:31.334 --> 11:33.267
- Where's Amber?
- Who?

11:36.367 --> 11:39.031
You're joking.
That's Zoe.

11:39.033 --> 11:40.667
What about this woman?

11:41.634 --> 11:44.332
Recognize her?

11:44.334 --> 11:46.131
No, I've never seen her, man.

11:46.133 --> 11:49.033
Don't play games.
This is a murder investigation.

11:56.868 --> 11:58.599
You, sit.

11:58.601 --> 11:59.701
Sir.

12:01.434 --> 12:04.765
These bills are registered
to a Zoe Hart.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.065
Amber's using a false I.D.

12:07.067 --> 12:08.398
More than one.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.934
She is far from one of
London's homeless victims.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.065
Right, tell me what you know
about Amber.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.298
I met her
at a club last night.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.966
She got fresh.
Came back to hers.

12:18.968 --> 12:21.365
- What do you do?
- I'm a concierge.

12:21.367 --> 12:22.799
Hotel at Heathrow Airport.

12:22.801 --> 12:25.065
I can't sit here all day
in my pants.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.398
Boss.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.732
Heroin under the bed.

12:27.734 --> 12:31.232
There's about 20 stamp bags
in there.

12:31.234 --> 12:33.165
That's Zoe's business
I don't get involved.

12:33.167 --> 12:35.601
One-night stand, you said.

12:38.701 --> 12:40.899
Now, you listen to me.

12:40.901 --> 12:43.065
Amber's last boyfriend
was found hanging from a tree

12:43.067 --> 12:43.899
with his face cut off.

12:43.901 --> 12:45.031
Was that her?

12:45.033 --> 12:46.832
She stabbed one of my officers
last night

12:46.834 --> 12:47.966
and left her for dead!

12:47.968 --> 12:48.932
Now, where is she?!

12:48.934 --> 12:50.334
Sir.

12:54.467 --> 12:56.400
Hey. Come here.

12:58.501 --> 13:00.232
If you want to find your wife,

13:00.234 --> 13:02.934
you need to start playing
by the rules, all right?

13:05.200 --> 13:07.699
I told him he can
go and get dressed.

13:07.701 --> 13:09.234
Fine.

13:10.868 --> 13:14.567
Let's see what PNC and CRIS
can give us on the stolen I.D.s.

13:15.467 --> 13:18.701
My car keys.
She's lifted my car keys.

13:25.968 --> 13:29.632
This was taken
at 7:04 this morning

13:29.634 --> 13:31.567
as Amber left the apartment.

13:40.734 --> 13:42.799
She told me she couldn't drive.

13:42.801 --> 13:44.465
I took her here, there,
and everywhere.

13:44.467 --> 13:46.534
Where, exactly?

13:48.634 --> 13:52.198
Shelters.
Crack houses.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.432
Homeless people take drugs.

13:53.434 --> 13:55.332
Better they get clean gear
from someone they trust.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.031
Is that what Amber told you?

13:57.033 --> 13:58.868
She had you hook, line,
and sinker, didn't she?

14:00.567 --> 14:02.567
She loves me.

14:04.634 --> 14:06.901
She didn't even give you
her real name.

14:09.367 --> 14:12.198
We've spoken to your colleagues,
by the way.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.532
Turns out you've been helping
yourself to cars at the hotel

14:14.534 --> 14:17.632
whilst their owners
have been away on holiday.

14:17.634 --> 14:19.866
I just... I just borrow them
for a bit.

14:19.868 --> 14:23.131
Asif Bapary,
I'm further arresting you

14:23.133 --> 14:24.665
for taking without consent.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.966
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

14:26.968 --> 14:28.365
if you do not mention
when questioned

14:28.367 --> 14:29.998
something which you later
rely on in court.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.799
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

14:31.801 --> 14:32.966
Do you understand?

14:32.968 --> 14:37.699
The I.D.s that Amber's
been using tell a story.

14:37.701 --> 14:40.434
The first is Zoe Hart.

14:41.767 --> 14:44.799
She died of a drugs overdose
three years ago.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.932
The second is Fiona White.

14:46.934 --> 14:51.031
She was found burnt to death in
a shelter behind King's Cross.

14:51.033 --> 14:53.165
Jane Gifford?

14:53.167 --> 14:56.365
Yeah, her body was pulled
from the Thames six months ago.

14:56.367 --> 14:58.499
Premortem injuries
are consistent

14:58.501 --> 14:59.966
with a number of stab wounds.

14:59.968 --> 15:01.499
That's the same as Tom Pryce.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.432
Now, I'm sure
Amber was the girl

15:03.434 --> 15:05.131
in Tom's room at the party.

15:05.133 --> 15:07.932
He rejected her,
so she killed him.

15:07.934 --> 15:12.499
Now, these attacks are getting
more frequent, more violent.

15:12.501 --> 15:14.534
I think Amber Saunders
is a psychopath.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.165
Rob.

15:27.167 --> 15:29.265
Do these women
look like Sarah to you?

15:29.267 --> 15:31.065
No, those girls are younger.

15:31.067 --> 15:34.801
Yeah, but Sarah fits
the physical profile.

15:36.133 --> 15:40.098
So it's possible
Amber killed her too.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.434
You all right, Graham?

17:17.834 --> 17:19.767
What you doing here?

17:29.100 --> 17:31.332
AMPR's picked up
a stolen vehicle.

17:31.334 --> 17:32.966
It's heading
towards Walthamstow.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.934
What's in Walthamstow?

17:36.467 --> 17:39.601
Uh, been a while.

17:41.801 --> 17:43.332
Feels like yesterday.

17:43.334 --> 17:45.133
Do you want to
put that knife down?

17:48.300 --> 17:49.832
Vivienne.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.765
I've cross-checked
Amber's antecedents on PNC.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.799
She grew up in Walthamstow.

17:54.801 --> 17:57.465
You want to head to
7 Inweir Gardens.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.799
Who lives there?

17:58.801 --> 18:02.765
A Graham Evans,
Amber's stepdad.

18:02.767 --> 18:04.298
And there's something else.

18:04.300 --> 18:08.400
In 2009 her mother, Joan,
was found dead in the bath.

18:15.133 --> 18:17.432
You killed my mum.

18:17.434 --> 18:20.767
Joanie topped herself.
It was nothing to do with me.

18:22.133 --> 18:27.200
You made me clean the blood
off the bathroom tile...

18:30.734 --> 18:34.601
...and you stood over me
and watched while I did it!

18:39.300 --> 18:42.398
What do you want me to do?
You want me to say I'm sorry?

18:42.400 --> 18:45.265
O-Okay, look, I'm sorry.

18:45.267 --> 18:47.866
Okay, I'm sorry.
I want you to leave.

18:47.868 --> 18:49.634
I've killed people.

18:53.033 --> 18:57.701
And it's all thanks to you.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.133
Okay.

19:11.167 --> 19:13.767
Well, here I am.

19:14.534 --> 19:16.067
Come and get me.

19:17.601 --> 19:19.267
I'm all yours.

19:20.501 --> 19:21.567
Buttercup.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.434
Don't call me that.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.601
Don't call me that!

19:34.601 --> 19:36.467
You can't do it, can you?

19:38.701 --> 19:40.901
You're just like your mum.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.734
No backbone.

19:46.467 --> 19:47.868
Call the police!

19:49.400 --> 19:51.367
Aah!

19:52.567 --> 19:53.868
Aah!

20:13.734 --> 20:14.832
Graham Evans?

20:14.834 --> 20:16.665
Detective Inspector
David Bradford.

20:16.667 --> 20:19.932
I already told this lot she
took off over the garden wall.

20:19.934 --> 20:23.098
Look, I would have been dead
if they hadn't walked in.

20:23.100 --> 20:25.131
Rob, radio the local
duty inspector.

20:25.133 --> 20:26.165
Beef up the search.

20:26.167 --> 20:27.998
Amber's on foot.
She can't get far.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.799
Boss.
Control from D.C. Brady.

20:29.801 --> 20:32.098
Have you any idea
where Amber might go?

20:32.100 --> 20:33.232
Family? Friends?

20:33.234 --> 20:35.932
Uh, well, Joan had a brother
in Scotland.

20:35.934 --> 20:37.866
Do you have a name
for Joan's brother?

20:37.868 --> 20:39.701
Martin De Souza.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.765
Joan's surname was De Souza?

20:42.767 --> 20:44.832
No wonder you made inspector.

20:44.834 --> 20:47.601
Did you and Joan ever marry?

20:49.501 --> 20:52.098
No.
No, we never got 'round to it.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.465
It was Amber.

20:53.467 --> 20:55.501
You know, she never accepted
my relationship with Joan.

20:58.033 --> 21:00.131
Well, she tried to split us up.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.232
Malicious little cow.

21:02.234 --> 21:06.665
She... She was forever telling
lies and stirring up trouble.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.298
And that's why Joan
slit her wrists.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.934
It was nothing to do with me.

21:14.868 --> 21:16.565
According to postmortem,

21:16.567 --> 21:19.465
Joan De Souza had
two unexplained breaks...

21:19.467 --> 21:21.899
one in the forearm,
one in the collarbone.

21:21.901 --> 21:26.031
Amber told social services
Graham was hitting her mum.

21:26.033 --> 21:28.665
So her stepdad's an abuser?

21:28.667 --> 21:30.966
Amber grew up
surrounded by violence.

21:30.968 --> 21:32.998
Joan refused to press charges.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.031
I think that is why
Amber targeted these women.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.599
- She was angry with her mum.
- How did you work that one out?

21:38.601 --> 21:41.832
Well, suicide of a parent
is the ultimate rejection.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.365
So, what does she do next?

21:44.367 --> 21:46.699
She went back to the source
of all her problems,

21:46.701 --> 21:50.434
her stepdad, but that didn't
give her any satisfaction.

21:51.434 --> 21:53.932
What, you mean she might go on
some sort of killing spree?

21:53.934 --> 21:55.365
Yeah, well, it's possible.

21:55.367 --> 21:57.098
Or she could turn her anger
another way

21:57.100 --> 21:58.932
and... and kill herself.

21:58.934 --> 22:00.165
There's no justice in that.

22:00.167 --> 22:01.966
We need to track her down
and arrest her.

22:01.968 --> 22:03.165
I'll warn the public.

22:03.167 --> 22:04.632
Oh, yeah...

22:04.634 --> 22:06.499
find out
who Amber's social worker was

22:06.501 --> 22:08.198
after her mum's suicide,
will you?

22:08.200 --> 22:09.599
Why?

22:09.601 --> 22:13.868
Vivienne, please, for once
in your life just do as I ask.

22:17.567 --> 22:21.767
Amber Saunders also goes by
the names Zoe Hart...

22:23.267 --> 22:28.367
...Jane Gifford,
and Fiona White.

22:29.300 --> 22:33.465
Under no circumstances
should she be approached.

22:33.467 --> 22:37.332
<i>Amber, if you are watching,</i>

22:37.334 --> 22:39.932
<i>we know you're in pain.</i>

22:39.934 --> 22:42.098
<i>We can get you the help
you need.</i>

22:42.100 --> 22:44.165
Please.

22:44.167 --> 22:45.901
Hand yourself in.

23:10.467 --> 23:12.501
Where have you been?

23:14.501 --> 23:15.834
Yeah.

23:16.968 --> 23:19.834
Yeah, okay, um,
I'll meet you there.

23:48.934 --> 23:51.501
Amber's social worker
was Sarah Bradford.

23:52.567 --> 23:54.632
But then, I think you knew that.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.532
The surname, De Souza,
rang a bell.

23:57.534 --> 23:59.031
Sarah must have mentioned it.

23:59.033 --> 24:01.732
When Amber's mum died,
the system let her down.

24:01.734 --> 24:03.599
Yeah, I remember.

24:03.601 --> 24:07.398
Sarah was upset that the kid
was stuck in a care home.

24:07.400 --> 24:11.634
Maybe Amber blamed Sarah
for what happened to her.

24:16.234 --> 24:17.667
We've got to face facts.

24:19.701 --> 24:22.767
There's a real possibility
that Amber killed my wife.

24:41.634 --> 24:43.198
What took you so long?

24:43.200 --> 24:44.901
I can't
just walk out of school.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.899
Why here, anyway?

24:50.901 --> 24:54.434
It's where my social worker
used to take me.

24:57.934 --> 25:00.801
Any news about your mum?

25:03.000 --> 25:06.200
Oi? You okay?

25:10.534 --> 25:13.734
I just don't want to be reminded
of my mum all of the time.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.298
Okay, so when was the last time

25:21.300 --> 25:24.232
that Sarah had contact
with Amber?

25:24.234 --> 25:25.499
I couldn't tell you.

25:25.501 --> 25:28.298
Maybe Sarah
saw her unofficially.

25:28.300 --> 25:29.300
I mean, it happens.

25:31.667 --> 25:33.901
When did you last see Sarah
with the bag?

25:35.501 --> 25:38.365
If we can pinpoint that,
then we can build a timeline.

25:38.367 --> 25:39.934
Oh, I don't know.

25:43.601 --> 25:46.966
Right, it's Italian leather,
it's expensive.

25:46.968 --> 25:50.100
Well, it's something
you would save for a night out.

25:57.601 --> 26:00.932
D.C.I. Franklin's retirement do.
When was that?

26:00.934 --> 26:02.866
About six months ago.

26:02.868 --> 26:05.966
Okay, so let's rewind to
before you went out that night.

26:05.968 --> 26:08.332
What was Sarah wearing?

26:08.334 --> 26:10.534
Did she have the bag?

26:18.067 --> 26:20.734
I've no idea.
I'm sorry.

26:23.501 --> 26:25.234
Maybe you could ask Carly.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.100
Not gonna answer it?

26:42.300 --> 26:44.567
It's him.
He'll go away eventually.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.732
Don't, don't.

26:47.734 --> 26:48.934
Hello.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.465
Who's this?

26:52.467 --> 26:55.467
Mate of Carly's.
Who are you?

26:56.834 --> 26:59.632
I'm her stepfather.
Put her on.

26:59.634 --> 27:02.200
She's, uh, kind of
got her hands full.

27:04.467 --> 27:05.832
Look, I'm gonna kill you.

27:05.834 --> 27:07.734
I said put her on.

27:08.801 --> 27:11.866
What's the magic word?

27:13.267 --> 27:15.065
Please.

27:15.067 --> 27:19.067
Yeah, my mum always said
manners cost you nothing.

27:21.000 --> 27:21.866
Yes.

27:21.868 --> 27:23.501
Who was that?

27:25.133 --> 27:26.501
Any news?

27:27.734 --> 27:29.198
No.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.665
Listen, do you remember
when me and your mum went out,

27:32.667 --> 27:34.532
all dressed up,
a few months back?

27:34.534 --> 27:36.165
To that works do.

27:36.167 --> 27:38.198
Uh, random.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.499
We're trying to remember
the last time

27:40.501 --> 27:42.398
she had her red handbag.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.765
Did she ever mention
giving it away?

27:44.767 --> 27:47.298
Why would she do that?

27:47.300 --> 27:48.665
She loved that bag.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.832
Yeah, I know.
I bought it for her birthday.

27:51.834 --> 27:54.265
You gave her the money.
That's not the same.

27:54.267 --> 27:58.332
Look, Carly, I don't want
another row, please.

27:58.334 --> 28:00.966
Just think.

28:00.968 --> 28:02.866
Look, I don't remember.

28:02.868 --> 28:04.067
All right?

28:05.501 --> 28:06.667
Okay.

28:07.667 --> 28:12.098
Listen, I might not
be back again tonight.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.866
Got a big case on.

28:13.868 --> 28:15.365
So, what's new?

28:15.367 --> 28:17.031
I want you
to go straight home.

28:17.033 --> 28:19.465
Get the cab.
I need to know you're safe.

28:19.467 --> 28:20.665
I'm with my mate.
I'll be fine.

28:20.667 --> 28:22.167
Carly...

28:29.801 --> 28:31.832
I thought
you weren't speaking to me.

28:31.834 --> 28:34.131
What?
Course I am.

28:34.133 --> 28:36.799
Last time
you came 'round mine,

28:36.801 --> 28:40.334
shared that spliff, I woke up,
you were long gone.

29:00.067 --> 29:01.632
Yeah, well...

29:01.634 --> 29:03.065
People to see, drugs to sell.

29:03.067 --> 29:05.131
We haven't all got a stepdaddy
to fund our lifestyle,

29:05.133 --> 29:06.467
do we, Carly?

29:10.334 --> 29:12.398
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm sorry.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.133
I've... I've just had
a hard day.

29:16.133 --> 29:17.532
Look, I should go.

29:17.534 --> 29:19.532
No, no, no.
Let me... Let me come with you.

29:19.534 --> 29:21.599
I'm fine.

29:21.601 --> 29:23.632
Carly, shut up.

29:23.634 --> 29:26.165
I'm not gonna let you go
on your own.

29:26.167 --> 29:28.133
Come on.

29:34.467 --> 29:37.098
Boss.
Billie's mobile.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.265
The tech unit
have downloaded the data.

29:39.267 --> 29:40.565
Anything?

29:40.567 --> 29:42.601
They're just sending over
the information via e-mail.

29:44.267 --> 29:45.534
What is your wife
doing up here?

29:48.801 --> 29:50.467
She was Amber Saunders'
social worker.

29:51.834 --> 29:53.901
We can't ignore the fact
she's now a potential victim.

29:58.501 --> 30:00.065
The incident room
have had a tip-off.

30:00.067 --> 30:03.165
A sighting
at 34 Kenville Close, E3.

30:03.167 --> 30:04.565
Is the information credible?

30:04.567 --> 30:06.765
Yeah, the description
of Amber's clothes matches,

30:06.767 --> 30:10.031
and the detective inspector
didn't make that public.

30:10.033 --> 30:11.532
Also the address is a squat,

30:11.534 --> 30:13.232
which is the sort of place
that Amber would be at.

30:13.234 --> 30:14.665
We'll call for backup
on the way.

30:14.667 --> 30:17.601
Right, I will authorize the
search, but for them, not you.

30:19.367 --> 30:21.200
You are far too close
to this now.

30:22.567 --> 30:24.601
Go.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.465
Yes!

30:37.467 --> 30:40.100
Let's get smashed.

30:42.133 --> 30:44.133
Sounds good to me.

30:54.133 --> 30:56.200
You must miss her.

30:59.033 --> 31:01.465
Yeah.

31:01.467 --> 31:03.667
Yeah, you have no idea.

31:07.934 --> 31:09.934
That's just it.

31:12.767 --> 31:15.334
I know exactly
what you're going through.

31:18.901 --> 31:20.732
So, what am I supposed to do?

31:20.734 --> 31:22.565
Sit at home
watching daytime telly?

31:22.567 --> 31:24.699
I am not suggesting
that you take leave.

31:24.701 --> 31:26.499
Just step aside
from the inquiry.

31:27.734 --> 31:30.665
Can I at least see
if that's anything relevant?

31:30.667 --> 31:31.868
Be my guest.

31:36.834 --> 31:38.667
It's from the tech unit.

31:39.300 --> 31:42.832
List of calls made
from Billie's phone.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.799
That last number looks like
she was ringing this building.

31:45.801 --> 31:47.400
That's Billie's extension.

31:50.634 --> 31:51.801
There's a new message.

31:53.968 --> 31:56.699
<i>You have one new message</i>

31:56.701 --> 31:58.832
<i>Nice place.</i>

31:59.934 --> 32:01.732
<i>The boss' wife is missing,</i>

32:01.734 --> 32:03.400
<i>and that's you with her bag.</i>

32:05.400 --> 32:06.567
<i>Yeah, I...</i>

32:08.267 --> 32:10.632
<i>I found it in a park
dumped on top of a bin.</i>

32:10.634 --> 32:11.932
I know that voice.

32:11.934 --> 32:13.432
<i>You're gonna need to
tell the team</i>

32:13.434 --> 32:16.398
<i>when you found it and where,
or I will.</i>

32:16.400 --> 32:19.131
<i>Sure, sure,
I'll tell them, obviously.</i>

32:19.133 --> 32:22.332
<i>If that's what you think.</i>

32:26.300 --> 32:29.432
<i>Fine.
I'll go.</i>

32:29.434 --> 32:31.365
You want me to stand down?

32:31.367 --> 32:33.667
Then that's what I'll do.

32:58.267 --> 33:00.365
All units,
strike, strike, strike!

33:01.734 --> 33:04.667
Police! Freeze!

33:19.200 --> 33:22.200
Suspect upstairs!

33:27.667 --> 33:29.932
Amber Saunders,
I'm arresting you

33:29.934 --> 33:31.131
on the suspicion of murder.

33:31.133 --> 33:33.400
You do not have to
say anything...

33:38.367 --> 33:40.234
We've been set up.

33:44.601 --> 33:48.367
Amber gave her two balls
of smack to swap clothes.

33:53.734 --> 33:55.665
What's the betting
that the so-called tip-off

33:55.667 --> 33:56.665
came from Amber?

33:56.667 --> 33:57.901
So where is she?

34:03.033 --> 34:04.033
Here.

34:12.132 --> 34:14.300
My mum killed herself.

34:33.033 --> 34:34.732
Only person I've ever spoken to
about it with

34:34.734 --> 34:36.266
is my social worker.

34:40.634 --> 34:41.931
We were good mates.

34:41.934 --> 34:43.900
Like, we got really close.

34:47.132 --> 34:49.801
Did it help?
Talking, I mean.

34:52.199 --> 34:53.667
Helped her.

34:55.934 --> 34:58.232
She had some serious issues.

34:58.234 --> 35:00.634
Her marriage was a disaster.

35:07.234 --> 35:10.031
My mum and stepdad
used to argue all the time.

35:10.033 --> 35:13.000
They had
proper shouting matches.

35:17.501 --> 35:20.131
You think your mum might have
done what my mum did?

35:20.133 --> 35:23.267
You know, ended it?

35:28.667 --> 35:31.599
Sorry. You know what?
No, that's none of my business.

35:31.601 --> 35:33.133
I shouldn't have said that.

35:37.501 --> 35:40.100
Sometimes I think
she's still alive.

35:44.634 --> 35:46.000
And then I think...

35:50.100 --> 35:53.232
...she would have
taken me with her.

35:53.234 --> 35:55.234
She wouldn't have
left me with him.

35:59.467 --> 36:03.232
I hate him.
I hate him so much.

36:03.234 --> 36:05.300
Come here.

36:09.934 --> 36:12.899
You don't have to put up
with his crap anymore.

36:12.901 --> 36:16.501
No.
We're gonna make this stop.

36:19.167 --> 36:21.367
Hey, where are you going?

36:26.534 --> 36:28.334
To run a bath.

36:59.934 --> 37:02.198
What do you want a bath for?

37:02.200 --> 37:04.400
It's not for me.
It's for you.

37:05.234 --> 37:06.701
To relax you.

37:08.567 --> 37:10.267
I'm gonna look after you.

37:12.434 --> 37:14.367
Come on.
Get undressed.

37:17.033 --> 37:19.400
You do trust me, don't you?

37:38.501 --> 37:40.565
All right, come on.
It's a nice temperature.

37:40.567 --> 37:42.599
- You got to get in it.
- What are you gonna do?

37:42.601 --> 37:44.532
Sit there.

37:44.534 --> 37:46.599
Take all your pain away.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.732
Come over here, Carly.

38:46.734 --> 38:48.599
She's staying where she is.
All right?

38:48.601 --> 38:50.868
No, no, no, no.
Don't touch her.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.167
Hello, Amber.

39:01.701 --> 39:03.365
Hello, Detective Inspector.

39:03.367 --> 39:05.732
Oh, wait,
you two know each other?

39:05.734 --> 39:09.765
We've never actually met,
but, yes.

39:09.767 --> 39:11.832
I know you, Amber.

39:11.834 --> 39:14.667
Your mum was Amber's
social worker.

39:17.234 --> 39:19.734
How'd you find out
we were here?

39:20.801 --> 39:22.167
We traced your phone signal.

39:24.033 --> 39:27.634
Liar. That's a lie 'cause I
dropped my phone in the Thames.

39:28.634 --> 39:30.031
You put a tracker
on Carly's phone.

39:30.033 --> 39:32.499
He's keeping tabs on you.
Put a tracker on your phone.

39:32.501 --> 39:33.966
What, next you're gonna be
locking her up?

39:33.968 --> 39:36.367
- I know how it goes.
- I met your stepfather.

39:37.968 --> 39:39.765
He's not a very nice man,
is he?

39:39.767 --> 39:44.665
Yeah, well, it takes one
to know one, doesn't it?

39:44.667 --> 39:46.767
Stand back!

39:48.934 --> 39:52.599
Carly reckons her mum
killed herself.

39:52.601 --> 39:55.434
And she thinks
you drove her to it.

39:58.234 --> 40:00.899
Carly, I-I don't know
where your mum is,

40:00.901 --> 40:03.165
but I do know
I didn't treat her properly,

40:03.167 --> 40:06.298
and I just want the chance
to tell her I'm sorry.

40:06.300 --> 40:09.398
Oh, wow!
I'm welling up here.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.866
Amber put the knife down.
And then we can talk.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.599
Yeah?
What's there to talk about?

40:14.601 --> 40:17.432
Where did you get
Sarah's bag from?

40:17.434 --> 40:19.632
Wouldn't you like to know?

40:19.634 --> 40:21.932
Wait, you took my mum's bag
last time you were here?

40:21.934 --> 40:23.732
Shut up!
Just shut up!

40:23.734 --> 40:25.465
See what you made me do?!

40:25.467 --> 40:28.198
Amber! Carly's bleeding.
Just let me help her.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.932
Sarah told me!

40:29.934 --> 40:31.866
She told me how unhappy
her marriage was.

40:31.868 --> 40:33.131
Miserable as sin!

40:33.133 --> 40:35.332
Amber, please, tell me
when you last saw my wife.

40:35.334 --> 40:37.899
Maybe he didn't
just beat her up.

40:37.901 --> 40:40.932
Maybe he went one step further
and finished her off!

40:40.934 --> 40:42.832
That's not true.
I wouldn't do that.

40:42.834 --> 40:44.499
- That's not who I am.
- Stay back!

40:44.501 --> 40:46.801
Aah!

41:19.033 --> 41:20.968
Carly, out!

41:22.567 --> 41:25.667
You are going nowhere until
you tell me where my wife is.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.699
Carly. Carly, what's happened.
You all right?

41:33.701 --> 41:34.734
Your dad called us.
Where is he?

41:41.968 --> 41:44.100
I tried to stop her.

42:09.434 --> 42:11.834
So talk me through
what happened, then?

42:15.067 --> 42:19.534
Amber climbed onto the edge.

42:21.434 --> 42:23.701
I couldn't get to her.
She just...

42:26.934 --> 42:28.632
Just slipped.

42:28.634 --> 42:31.031
Well, did...
did she say anything?

42:31.033 --> 42:32.868
Anything about
Sarah's disappearance?

42:36.267 --> 42:37.567
No.

42:38.734 --> 42:40.934
Nothing.

42:50.033 --> 42:53.334
I met Amber when she was
selling weed outside my school.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.834
Did your mum
ever mention Amber?

43:01.367 --> 43:03.267
No, I don't think so.

43:14.534 --> 43:15.667
Hey.

43:17.167 --> 43:18.534
Hey.

43:21.834 --> 43:23.767
What happened?

43:24.767 --> 43:27.133
Well, um, I was hoping
you could tell <i>me</i> that.

43:34.634 --> 43:37.300
Amber came to the flat.

43:40.367 --> 43:41.868
She had a knife.

43:45.033 --> 43:48.133
Where is she?
Have you arrested her?

43:52.701 --> 43:53.734
She's dead.

43:54.934 --> 43:56.167
How?

44:00.968 --> 44:03.000
Amber took her own life.

44:05.067 --> 44:07.998
Can you find me
somewhere to stay?

44:08.000 --> 44:09.234
What about your dad?

44:10.234 --> 44:11.699
No.

44:11.701 --> 44:13.067
I need to get away from him.

44:17.534 --> 44:20.265
I think he killed Amber.

44:20.267 --> 44:22.565
I think he pushed her
off the balcony.

44:22.567 --> 44:24.067
Just like he killed my mum.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.601
Carly.

44:37.067 --> 44:39.234
I'm so relieved you're okay.
