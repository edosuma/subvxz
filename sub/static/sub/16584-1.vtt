02:49.302 --> 02:51.373
Chance got it, dude.
Chance fucking has it.

02:51.437 --> 02:53.041
How you been, man?

02:55.575 --> 02:56.679
Come in for a picture.

02:58.545 --> 02:59.922
Oh, my God.

02:59.979 --> 03:01.356
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

03:23.303 --> 03:25.510
I didn't even fucking tell them.
They just started doing that.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.518
I didn't even fucking tell them anything.

03:28.775 --> 03:29.947
Why'd you stop?

03:30.009 --> 03:31.215
What are you doing?

03:31.277 --> 03:33.848
No, Brad didn't... You want a bump?
You want more coke? Cool.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.056
- You guys want a bump? Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:38.017 --> 03:39.394
In your mouth?

03:39.452 --> 03:42.296
Your friend's a pro. You want one?

03:42.355 --> 03:43.834
Let's do it.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.063
- Fucking A, man.
- That was cuckoo.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.636
- You want some coke, Brad?
- No, I'm good, bro. I'm good.

03:48.695 --> 03:51.733
You want a little... Take a little...
Take a little like this.

03:51.798 --> 03:52.799
Put a little on your gums?

03:52.865 --> 03:53.866
- I'm straight, bro.
- Sure?

03:53.933 --> 03:55.435
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.440
Don't worry about it.

03:59.105 --> 04:00.209
Shit.

04:00.273 --> 04:01.274
Man.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.151
- Shit.
- Leah. Leah. Leah. Come here.

04:05.211 --> 04:07.054
Come in here. Come in here. We got coke.

04:07.113 --> 04:09.525
- You want some coke? Come in.
- I'm cool.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.027
No. What, you wanna do a bump?

04:11.084 --> 04:12.222
I'm gonna take off.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.961
- What are you doing?
- Are you embarrassed right now?

04:19.024 --> 04:20.527
No, man. No.
I'm not fucking embarrassed.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.197
I'm just tired.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.366
Okay, you need to liven up a little bit.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.931
- 'Cause this is a sure thing.
- I know.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.671
Right here, it's fucking...

04:26.733 --> 04:28.041
I know. I'm just not into it tonight.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.543
I love you. I gotta call it a night, okay?

04:30.603 --> 04:33.607
It's about Leah?
Bro, how long are you chasing that?

04:33.673 --> 04:35.118
Fucking...

04:35.174 --> 04:36.380
Fuck off, B.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.513
- Okay? I'm not leaving 'cause of Leah.
- All right, all right.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.216
Dude, this party is
fucking weird as hell anyway.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.657
All right. Tell Mom and Dad I said hi.

04:41.714 --> 04:43.387
- Okay, I will. I love you.
- I'm sorry.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.191
No, no, no. I'm just fucking...
Just don't drive tonight.

04:55.194 --> 04:56.798
Hey! I know you, right?

04:57.563 --> 04:58.735
Me?

04:58.798 --> 05:01.335
Yeah. Hey, I saw you inside.
Do you think I can get a ride?

05:01.401 --> 05:03.574
- Where are you going?
- Not far.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.748
I'm sorry, dude. It's kind of late.
I got to get home.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.943
Come on, man. It's right up the road.

05:11.678 --> 05:12.816
Yeah.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.790
Yeah, yeah. Okay, sure.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.621
Yeah, this is me right here.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.663
All right, hang on a sec.
Let me grab my boy.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.755
- Your boy?
- Yeah.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.766
Look, it'll just take a sec, man. I swear.

05:23.923 --> 05:24.924
Okay.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.702
Fucking kidding me?

05:37.704 --> 05:39.274
Weren't taking off without us, were you?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.683
No. No, no, no. I was just waiting.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.449
- All right.
- Yeah.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.783
All right. Thanks, man.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.849
All right.

06:00.493 --> 06:02.939
So, wait. How do you guys know Colin?

06:02.995 --> 06:04.372
Who the fuck is Colin, man?

06:04.997 --> 06:07.068
He's the kid whose house we were at.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.511
Oh, right. Yeah, it's his boy.
Right, man?

06:09.936 --> 06:10.937
Yeah.

06:11.003 --> 06:12.710
You guys go to Brookman?
My brother goes there.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.653
Brookman? No, man. We go somewhere else.

06:18.277 --> 06:19.654
Just keep driving.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.649
Straight?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.696
Yeah, yeah, man. Keep going.
It's a ways.

06:27.253 --> 06:29.255
I thought you said
it was just up the road.

06:52.779 --> 06:55.760
- We getting close?
- Yeah. Yeah, man. Take a left.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.488
- What, here?
- Yeah.

07:07.994 --> 07:10.531
Listen, guys. I gotta get back home.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.701
Hey, relax, man. We're almost there.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.245
I know. It's just late. Is there
some place close I can drop you off?

07:15.301 --> 07:16.712
- Where do you suggest?
- I don't know, man.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.248
I'm about to turn around
any second, though.

07:18.304 --> 07:19.942
Wait, wait.
Hey, man. What's your problem?

07:20.606 --> 07:23.416
You're freaking out like a little bitch.
Stop being such a baby.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.216
For real, man.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.622
I'm not being a baby, man.
You told me it was just up the road.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.626
I've been driving 20 minutes. Like...

07:31.083 --> 07:33.290
All right. Okay. All right. Pull over then.

07:35.054 --> 07:36.556
Look, man. I'm not, you know...

07:36.622 --> 07:38.226
Stop the fucking car!

07:54.907 --> 07:56.614
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.055
Your hand's shaking.

08:02.181 --> 08:04.024
Okay. What do you guys want? Seriously.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.757
Relax. We're here now anyway.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.901
- Stop! Okay, stop! Stop, stop!
- Motherfucker!

08:16.963 --> 08:17.998
Stop!

08:26.372 --> 08:28.579
Look, you don't need to hurt me, okay?

08:30.309 --> 08:32.015
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.

08:49.795 --> 08:50.933
Okay. Okay.

09:00.439 --> 09:01.918
What's your ATM code?

09:03.409 --> 09:04.444
What?

09:05.778 --> 09:07.587
Tell me your fucking ATM code right now,

09:07.647 --> 09:09.649
or I swear to God I'll fucking kill you.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.126
4-1-1-4.

09:11.183 --> 09:13.185
- Don't fucking lie to me.
- It's 4-1-1-4.

09:13.252 --> 09:14.856
I swear to God, dude, I'm not...

09:28.367 --> 09:29.607
Can you please just let me go?

09:29.669 --> 09:30.977
Shut the fuck up.

09:36.175 --> 09:37.620
Look, I don't have anything.

09:37.677 --> 09:40.157
Shut up. Stop talking.

09:53.626 --> 09:54.627
Okay.

09:55.027 --> 09:56.131
All right. Okay.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.317
Stay.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.222
Stay.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.090
Stay.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.170
Wanna get in on this?

10:47.413 --> 10:48.915
Come on, man. Let's go.

13:19.398 --> 13:20.502
No, no. I'm fine.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.477
- What is this?
- Easy, easy, easy.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.046
Just give me a sec, bro.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.277
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.092
I've been driving around for three hours

13:45.157 --> 13:47.330
with a knife in my car,
trying to find these guys.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.036
Chance is coming over with his dad's gun.

13:54.099 --> 13:55.737
I swear to God,
we're gonna fucking kill them.

13:55.801 --> 13:57.041
It doesn't matter, Brett.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.349
Of course it fucking matters.

14:02.608 --> 14:03.882
They're not gonna
get away with this, Brad.

14:03.943 --> 14:05.513
You're never gonna find them, man.

14:08.214 --> 14:09.318
Well, tell me what they look like.

14:09.381 --> 14:10.883
They don't look like anything. Okay?

14:10.950 --> 14:13.590
What the fuck are you talking about,
"They don't look anything"?

14:13.652 --> 14:15.529
Brad. Fuck!

14:22.795 --> 14:23.899
All right.

14:52.791 --> 14:55.738
- So, did they have a weapon?
- No, not that I was aware of.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.804
But they forced their way into the car?

15:00.466 --> 15:01.501
No.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.174
So, you gave two complete strangers a ride

15:07.239 --> 15:09.344
out in the middle of nowhere,
because you're a nice guy...

15:09.408 --> 15:11.820
- No, I told...
- I'm just trying to understand.

15:11.877 --> 15:15.415
I told you that they were at the party,
and that they asked me for a ride home.

15:15.481 --> 15:18.428
- And they tried to steal your car.
- Yes.

15:19.351 --> 15:20.625
I've seen your car.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.068
What I can't understand is
why they beat you up so bad.

15:26.792 --> 15:30.899
Did you say something to them?
Call them something? Resist?

15:30.963 --> 15:32.533
- Provoke?
- Fuck do I know?

15:38.938 --> 15:42.351
You know what I think?
I think you were looking for drugs.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.115
I think you were
trying to buy drugs from these guys

15:44.176 --> 15:45.246
and things got out of hand.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.291
It happens. This I can help you with.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.922
I wasn't trying to buy drugs.

15:54.586 --> 15:57.362
Okay. Not trying to buy drugs.

16:01.093 --> 16:03.039
I don't know what else to tell you.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.673
You go home and get some rest.
We'll follow up.

17:10.796 --> 17:11.830
Fuck.

18:12.224 --> 18:13.862
What are you doing here?

18:14.493 --> 18:16.837
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.

18:18.964 --> 18:20.568
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.980
- Thanks, man.
- Got you.

18:36.014 --> 18:37.015
So, what you been up to?

18:38.584 --> 18:40.257
Yeah, dude. I'm sorry.
I haven't been back before now.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.560
I've just been crazy busy, you know.

18:44.923 --> 18:47.460
- How you doing?
- Good.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.603
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:50.662 --> 18:53.165
Yeah. Mom said you're thinking
about bailing on school.

18:53.232 --> 18:54.370
I'm not bailing on it.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.969
I just don't know
if I can get all my shit together

18:56.034 --> 18:57.445
before the fall, you know.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.210
But you're already accepted for the fall.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.114
Plus, Phi Sig is only rushing in the fall.

19:01.173 --> 19:02.675
I don't know, man.

19:07.613 --> 19:10.321
I'm not putting any pressure on you.
I'm just saying.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.456
You should come this weekend, though.

19:12.518 --> 19:13.758
We're throwing a huge party at the lake.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.355
I think Leah is gonna be there.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.263
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm sure you do know.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.631
You gonna go ass-grab?

19:26.031 --> 19:27.408
Jesus Christ.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.545
Okay.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.549
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'll come for the weekend.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.278
Fuck, yeah!

19:35.340 --> 19:37.149
Just for the weekend, though.

19:37.209 --> 19:39.314
Yeah. It's all you need. Just...

19:39.378 --> 19:41.016
Get right in there and grab that ass.

19:43.749 --> 19:44.750
Jesus.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.386
- It's good to see you, man.
- You too, bro.

19:53.425 --> 19:54.631
Lando!

19:56.161 --> 19:57.572
- How you doing, man?
- How you been?

19:57.629 --> 19:58.972
Hi. You look good. You're good?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.339
You all right? Hey, man. How are you?

20:00.866 --> 20:01.970
- How you been?
- Good.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.035
- Good to see you.
- You too, man.

20:03.101 --> 20:04.409
- Grab a beer.
- Here you go.

20:05.003 --> 20:06.277
Welcome, Lands.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.340
- Thanks, man.
- Say hello, everybody.

20:08.407 --> 20:10.478
- Hey, Brett.
- Brett!

20:10.542 --> 20:11.577
How you doing?

20:11.643 --> 20:13.054
Come over here, you fucking asshole.

20:13.579 --> 20:14.922
Couple of my brothers here.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.755
- Wes.
- Yeah, good to meet you.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.498
So, where you been all summer?

20:28.560 --> 20:31.131
Just had some shit I had to deal with,
back home.

20:33.498 --> 20:34.909
Brad got fucking rolled up on

20:34.967 --> 20:37.345
by some white trash fucking rednecks, man.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.683
Those townie dudes in Dawson
are no joke, man.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.013
They know they got nothing to lose.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.315
These motherfuckers are
literally on their way to jail

20:44.376 --> 20:46.117
and they figure, shit,
they can put you in the hospital

20:46.178 --> 20:47.782
at the same time. All the better, right?

20:47.846 --> 20:48.984
So, what happened?

20:50.182 --> 20:52.162
Just beat my ass, stole my car.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.529
I'm just saying, man, you creep up
on a dude like that behind his back,

20:55.587 --> 20:56.622
you're straight pussy, man.

20:58.957 --> 21:00.197
I'll say this, though.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.429
My boy Brad knows
how to take a fucking punch, man.

21:04.730 --> 21:05.731
Unlike some of us.

21:06.365 --> 21:07.366
What...

21:07.432 --> 21:09.002
Why are you flinching, Baity?

21:09.067 --> 21:10.205
Fuck you.

21:11.703 --> 21:12.704
You piece of shit.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.245
- Baity, why are you flinching?
- I hate all of you.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.961
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.229
Do you mind if I sit?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.271
No, no. Please. Got some towel.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.161
Towel here.

21:39.598 --> 21:41.134
I'm really glad you came.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.039
Me, too.

21:46.204 --> 21:47.342
Yeah.

21:47.406 --> 21:48.646
How are you?

21:49.274 --> 21:50.582
I'm good.

21:53.545 --> 21:55.650
Yeah, they found
a fracture in my jaw, though.

21:56.548 --> 22:00.587
I mean, I remember when it happened.
'Cause I could hear it, you know...

22:00.652 --> 22:02.996
I mean, this guy's fist just like...

22:05.057 --> 22:06.866
Kept slamming into my face.

22:10.128 --> 22:12.734
But I remember, I was thinking of you.

22:14.800 --> 22:15.938
What do you mean?

22:17.369 --> 22:23.217
Your last memory of me was
me abandoning you at a party.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.276
- No!
- And...

22:24.343 --> 22:26.323
No, you did not abandon me.

22:28.413 --> 22:29.858
At all. No.

22:32.984 --> 22:34.156
Seriously.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.309
B. You seen my keys?

22:51.002 --> 22:52.072
Shit.

22:52.871 --> 22:53.975
Sorry.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.918
I'm gonna go get another beer, actually.

22:56.975 --> 22:59.148
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
- Cool.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.656
Can of beer. All right.

23:06.985 --> 23:09.363
I thought you said
she had a fucking boyfriend, bro.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.604
You're so drunk right now, aren't you?

23:15.660 --> 23:18.004
Can you just get me another fucking drink?

23:18.797 --> 23:20.276
You...

23:20.332 --> 23:21.675
Just keep your voice down.

23:22.501 --> 23:23.980
Wouldn't want you to drive this way.

23:24.035 --> 23:25.571
That's probably a good idea, buddy.

23:25.637 --> 23:27.310
Probably take a nap
or something like that.

23:27.372 --> 23:28.373
Yeah.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.681
Easy with the fucking mirror, bro.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.313
It's all good, man. We're good.

23:33.378 --> 23:34.618
Yeah, I don't have the keys, bro.

23:34.679 --> 23:36.090
I got it. I got it.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.422
'Cause you had them.

23:37.482 --> 23:39.894
Yeah, here. Right there. Hold on a sec.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.925
- Do you have them?
- Yeah, I got them.

23:45.290 --> 23:46.462
All right.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.360
Okay.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.338
- Hey, Brett. Brett? Hey.
- Yeah? Yeah?

23:51.229 --> 23:52.765
Do you think I'm a pussy?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.238
You're drunk, dude.

23:58.136 --> 23:59.444
Hey, hey.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.909
I don't know why I didn't fight back.

24:06.344 --> 24:07.652
Okay? I don't know.

24:08.313 --> 24:10.850
- I don't know. Okay?
- Okay.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.324
You know, like...

24:15.587 --> 24:16.895
If I had to do it again...

24:22.828 --> 24:24.102
All right. I'm just gonna...

24:24.162 --> 24:25.800
- I'm just gonna get this.
- Okay.

24:25.864 --> 24:27.002
There we go.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.412
I kissed her, you know.

24:32.003 --> 24:33.914
I know. I saw you.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.282
- Don't try to kiss me.
- I won't kiss you.

24:36.341 --> 24:37.752
Just get in the car. You're good.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.811
I'm good. Everything's good.

24:52.524 --> 24:54.401
- That is why you wear glasses.
- Shut up.

24:54.459 --> 24:56.735
I don't know if you remember this.
I didn't look at the fucking sun.

24:56.795 --> 24:58.433
- Fuck you.
- What, did you close your eyes?

24:58.497 --> 25:00.101
I wouldn't be surprised, man.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.473
That's the dumbest game ever.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.466
Could you throw me my hoodie, dude?

25:30.662 --> 25:32.141
When are you driving back?

25:34.733 --> 25:35.905
Next Sunday.

25:41.072 --> 25:43.109
I've been thinking, man. I...

25:45.443 --> 25:46.888
I think I'm gonna go.

25:48.413 --> 25:49.585
Go where?

25:50.248 --> 25:52.524
Like, I think I'm gonna
start school on time.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.160
Brad, that's fucking awesome.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.091
Yeah?

25:59.791 --> 26:00.792
That's...

26:01.960 --> 26:03.769
That's amazing.

26:06.598 --> 26:08.544
- Thank you. Thanks, man. Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.361
- You good?
- Yeah, I got it.

27:00.418 --> 27:01.522
Six...

27:02.420 --> 27:03.490
Four.

27:04.222 --> 27:07.533
Dude. This room is way fucking bigger
than I thought it was gonna be.

27:07.592 --> 27:08.866
It's not bad.

27:10.195 --> 27:11.299
All right.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.008
That's a pretty sweet TV.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.045
- Yeah. Good to go.
- Nice.

27:16.534 --> 27:18.207
Hey, what's up, man?

27:18.269 --> 27:19.475
One of you Brad?

27:20.372 --> 27:21.407
I'm your roommate.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.975
Will Fitchley.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.247
But people call me Fitch.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.845
Right on, dude. I'm Brad Land.

27:26.444 --> 27:28.287
It's really good to meet you.
This is my brother, Brett.

27:28.346 --> 27:29.347
What's up, man?

27:29.681 --> 27:31.683
Shit, dude. Are you in Phi Sig?

27:31.750 --> 27:33.991
- I am. Yeah.
- Dude, that's awesome.

27:34.052 --> 27:35.622
So, what's up with rush?

27:36.421 --> 27:38.298
Can anybody come out? Or...

27:38.356 --> 27:39.357
Yeah, of course.

27:39.424 --> 27:40.960
Yeah. We actually
got a party on Saturday.

27:41.026 --> 27:42.471
You should come out. Brad's coming.

27:42.527 --> 27:43.904
Yeah. I will totally be there.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.100
- That sounds awesome, man.
- Cool.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.540
All right. Cool.

27:46.598 --> 27:47.770
We got some more stuff...

27:47.832 --> 27:49.140
Yeah, we got some more boxes, man.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.679
- Good to meet you, bro.
- Yeah, dude.

27:50.735 --> 27:53.045
I'll see you in a second, though, man.
It's good to meet you, Will.

27:53.104 --> 27:54.378
Yeah, good to meet you, too.

29:30.135 --> 29:33.275
Hey, what did I tell you? It's good, right?
It's just fucking chill.

29:33.338 --> 29:36.478
Brett. Brett. It's fucking awesome, dude.
Seriously.

29:36.541 --> 29:38.282
These are some of the best dudes
we'll ever fucking know.

29:38.343 --> 29:39.651
Like, I mean that.

29:39.711 --> 29:41.452
I get it. I got you.

29:41.513 --> 29:42.924
I'm excited. I'm excited you're here.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.326
Good.

29:45.383 --> 29:46.919
What's up, motherfuckers?

29:48.787 --> 29:49.993
Who's this fucking...

29:50.054 --> 29:51.590
Who's this fucking Ellen DeGeneres here?

29:53.324 --> 29:54.735
Dude, that's my fucking roommate.

29:54.793 --> 29:55.863
No!

29:57.328 --> 29:58.966
Fuck, dude. I'm sorry.

30:39.270 --> 30:40.476
Okay.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.014
I'm leaving.

31:08.132 --> 31:09.770
What's up, man? How you doing, dude?

31:09.834 --> 31:10.938
- I'm good, man.
- Yeah?

31:11.002 --> 31:12.675
- Yeah.
- You feeling all right?

31:12.737 --> 31:14.080
You ready? Hell Week's coming up.

31:14.138 --> 31:15.139
Yeah, I'm ready, man.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.344
- You sure?
- Yeah.

31:16.407 --> 31:18.148
Man. I'm not so sure.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.882
Got some hot girls in your dorm?

31:19.944 --> 31:21.582
- One or two. What?
- "One or two."

31:21.646 --> 31:23.216
What are you doing right now?
Where you going?

31:23.281 --> 31:24.316
I'm just going to class.

31:24.382 --> 31:27.022
No, fuck that.
We're going to the bar, brother.

31:27.085 --> 31:28.189
It's kind of early, no?

31:28.253 --> 31:30.255
You're smart enough, man.
Don't be a pussy. Come on.

31:33.291 --> 31:34.429
So, how you been anyway, man?

31:34.492 --> 31:35.664
- I'm good, man.
- Yeah?

31:35.727 --> 31:37.570
- Yeah. I'm doing good, I think.
- Yeah.

31:38.329 --> 31:40.400
Fucking trying not to
sleep through class, right?

31:40.465 --> 31:42.775
No, how you been?
How you been since the...

31:43.434 --> 31:45.744
Fucking... Whatever.
Since your accident?

31:51.109 --> 31:54.318
You're gonna be Phi Sig, man. All right?

31:54.379 --> 31:55.756
That shit's never gonna happen again.

31:55.813 --> 31:58.316
First of all, you're never gonna
find yourself in that position again.

31:58.383 --> 31:59.384
Ever.

31:59.450 --> 32:00.952
Yeah, I gotta get in first.

32:02.153 --> 32:04.064
Yeah, you gotta get in.

32:04.122 --> 32:05.533
Yes, you do have to get in first.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.797
Finish that beer, man.
We're doing shots tonight, man.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.668
- You fucking... You serious?
- Me and you, we're doing shots.

32:09.727 --> 32:10.728
We're blacking out tonight, motherfucker.

32:10.795 --> 32:11.796
- Finish that beer.
- When is it?

32:11.863 --> 32:14.707
Phi Sigma Mu, motherfucker!

32:18.870 --> 32:21.180
Yeah, man! Don't stop, motherfucker.

32:21.239 --> 32:23.947
Yes. Yes.

32:30.315 --> 32:31.487
Oh, God.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.006
How you doing?

32:52.637 --> 32:53.672
What?

32:55.239 --> 32:56.513
I think I love you.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.547
- You don't mean that.
- No.

33:02.580 --> 33:03.957
I don't know, I just...

33:05.283 --> 33:06.728
I could love you.

33:10.088 --> 33:11.533
I don't even know you.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.634
Look.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.642
I have to be up really early tomorrow.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.941
I think maybe you should go.

34:21.659 --> 34:22.797
Brad.

34:24.529 --> 34:26.634
Dixon, Brad. Brad, Dixon.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.074
This is my brother I was talking about.

34:28.933 --> 34:30.469
- What's up, Brad? Hey.
- Hey, man.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.248
- One of those?
- Yeah.

34:35.106 --> 34:38.485
Brad, how do you like all the shit so far?

34:39.010 --> 34:41.513
I don't know. It's good times, right?

34:44.348 --> 34:45.452
Right.

34:46.384 --> 34:48.762
So, you're a business major,
like your fag brother here or what?

34:49.053 --> 34:50.429
No.

34:50.487 --> 34:54.025
No, I don't really have a major yet.
I'll probably just wait and see.

34:55.193 --> 34:57.764
Cool. Nice. Good luck with that.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.871
All right, well, I left Chance on the grill.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.075
I got to make sure
he's not fucking the burgers, so...

35:07.972 --> 35:09.007
See you, dude.

35:15.079 --> 35:17.685
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

35:19.450 --> 35:21.657
All that "good times" bullshit?

35:21.719 --> 35:24.632
Bro, they're not gonna let you in here
just 'cause you're my brother. I can't...

35:24.689 --> 35:26.362
Yeah, I fucking know that.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.468
All right. 'Cause they're
weird about that shit.

35:29.527 --> 35:31.939
You need to fucking shake their hand,
look them in the eye,

35:31.996 --> 35:33.066
let them know you want to be here.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.735
All right. What do you fucking
want me to do?

35:34.799 --> 35:36.039
I want you to just have fun.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.340
- Okay.
- And just chill out.

35:37.401 --> 35:38.505
- Okay.
- Right now, though,

35:38.569 --> 35:40.276
take a fucking shot of this.

35:40.338 --> 35:41.612
Some man shit.

35:41.672 --> 35:43.276
Then we're gonna
have a good time, all right?

35:44.208 --> 35:45.915
Come on. Let's go.

35:47.912 --> 35:50.620
There you go. Are you good?

35:50.681 --> 35:51.819
Holy shit. Yeah.

35:52.316 --> 35:53.420
All right.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.327
Who's this up in my motherfucking house?

35:55.386 --> 35:58.094
Shit! Look who it is.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.191
- What's going on, man?
- Chance!

35:59.257 --> 36:00.327
How you doing, brother?

36:00.391 --> 36:01.734
- How are you, brother?
- Man. I'm good.

36:01.792 --> 36:02.793
- You good?
- Good to see you.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.430
Yeah, welcome back. This is Mitch.

36:04.495 --> 36:05.997
- What's up, Mitch?
- Hey, how you doing?

36:06.063 --> 36:07.337
- Baity. Nice to meet you.
- All right.

36:07.398 --> 36:10.379
Class of 2000. Craziest motherfucker
to come through this school.

36:10.434 --> 36:11.845
Craziest motherfucker
to come through this school.

36:11.903 --> 36:12.938
Maybe. Maybe.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.540
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

36:14.605 --> 36:17.017
- Mitch?
- What!

36:17.074 --> 36:18.314
What's up, you fucking pussy?

36:18.376 --> 36:19.480
You fucking animal.

36:19.544 --> 36:21.751
Get the fuck down here, you fucking faggot

36:21.812 --> 36:24.156
and suck my cock right now!

36:24.715 --> 36:26.558
Show me some fucking respect!

36:28.152 --> 36:29.290
Now!

36:29.820 --> 36:30.855
Beer.

36:31.756 --> 36:33.463
Just one. I got to go.

36:33.691 --> 36:34.692
"One."

36:34.759 --> 36:38.206
I got to get back to Vanessa and the kid.
I got a kid now, bro.

36:38.262 --> 36:39.866
- You got a kid?
- I got a fucking kid now.

36:39.931 --> 36:40.932
Fuck that, Dad.

36:40.998 --> 36:42.375
Don't call me fucking "dad."

36:42.433 --> 36:43.969
- Fuck you, man.
- Fucking dad.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.537
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

36:47.972 --> 36:49.508
He's back, baby!

36:49.574 --> 36:51.520
- Line it up. Line it up.
- Here. Right here.

36:54.679 --> 36:56.420
- Cheers.
- Cheers, you pussies.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.053
- For the boys. For the boys.
- Down the hatch.

36:59.116 --> 37:00.117
All right.

37:01.919 --> 37:03.193
- Hey.
- You guys know Mitch?

37:03.254 --> 37:04.255
What's up, brother?

37:04.322 --> 37:05.767
- Brad?
- Yeah.

37:06.624 --> 37:09.605
Hey, is this the motherfucker
who got his ass beat?

37:09.660 --> 37:12.573
Brad got jumped
by some dickless pieces of shit, man.

37:12.630 --> 37:13.631
It's bullshit.

37:13.698 --> 37:14.699
Brad.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.403
That can't fucking happen.

37:19.870 --> 37:21.110
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

37:22.306 --> 37:23.580
You know why?

37:24.942 --> 37:27.445
This is Phi Sigma Mu.

37:28.112 --> 37:31.423
Okay? We're gentlemen.
We don't like to fight,

37:31.983 --> 37:35.795
but if we got to fight, then we all fight.

37:35.853 --> 37:36.923
Do you hear what I'm saying?

37:36.988 --> 37:40.162
Some motherfucker
wants to go through Chance,

37:40.224 --> 37:41.669
they gotta go through all of us.

37:42.326 --> 37:45.967
They wanna fuck with Brett,
they're going through all of us!

37:46.764 --> 37:48.334
It's the same with you.

37:48.399 --> 37:50.436
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

37:52.436 --> 37:53.779
Punch me in the face.

37:54.839 --> 37:56.785
- What... What?
- Punch me in the fucking face!

37:56.841 --> 37:58.616
- No, dude.
- Punch me in the face!

37:58.676 --> 38:00.485
Punch me in the fucking face!

38:00.544 --> 38:02.319
- I'm not gonna fucking punch...
- Do it!

38:02.380 --> 38:03.381
All right.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.484
Punch me in the fucking stomach.

38:05.549 --> 38:08.223
Punch me in the stomach!
Punch me in the stomach!

38:08.286 --> 38:09.731
Punch me in the stomach!

38:16.761 --> 38:17.933
Punch me in the stomach.

38:18.763 --> 38:20.800
Give me a slap! Slap my fucking face!

38:20.865 --> 38:22.811
Slap me! Slap me!

38:30.574 --> 38:34.147
To the greatest group of gentlemen

38:34.211 --> 38:38.023
the civilized world has ever known.

38:38.082 --> 38:41.291
- Phi Sigma Mu!
- Phi Sigma Mu!

38:41.352 --> 38:43.229
Holy Phi Sigma Mu!

38:43.287 --> 38:45.062
We are brothers through and through.

38:45.122 --> 38:46.692
Seldom cuss and never lie.

38:46.757 --> 38:48.430
We are brothers till we die.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.233
Holy Phi Sigma Mu!

38:50.294 --> 38:52.001
We are brothers through and through.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.542
Seldom cuss and never lie.

38:53.597 --> 38:55.474
We are brothers till we die!

39:10.781 --> 39:13.455
I don't know. Are you guys sure?
I still think these are too big.

39:13.517 --> 39:16.191
Oh, my God.
Will, relax man. You look fine.

39:17.054 --> 39:18.465
How do you guys feel about Hell Week?

39:18.522 --> 39:20.593
Dude, if one more person asks me
that fucking question...

39:20.658 --> 39:22.365
They're just trying to scare us, man.

39:22.426 --> 39:24.804
I don't know, Baity.
They did say something about a goat.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.842
They're trying to fucking scare us.

39:31.235 --> 39:32.475
Fucking goat.

39:58.195 --> 40:00.471
She's fucking cute, dude.

40:00.531 --> 40:01.532
Have you ever fucking...

40:01.599 --> 40:03.306
Have you ever had sex with a stripper?

40:03.367 --> 40:04.778
No, have you?

40:04.835 --> 40:06.143
All the time.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.379
No, no.

40:15.613 --> 40:17.183
You guys wanna get out of here?

40:17.248 --> 40:18.989
You wanna get out of here?

40:19.049 --> 40:20.494
I have a surprise for you.

40:27.191 --> 40:28.431
All right, you haven't been in here?

40:28.659 --> 40:30.036
- No, dude.
- No, dude.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.404
Pledges aren't allowed
in the fucking legacy room.

40:32.463 --> 40:34.409
You know what else
pledges aren't allowed to do?

40:35.332 --> 40:37.676
Smoke my fucking Cuban cigars.

40:38.602 --> 40:39.637
Shit.

40:40.237 --> 40:42.717
- Holy shit. Is this real?
- Yeah, dude.

40:42.773 --> 40:45.276
My dad gives them to me for my birthday.

40:45.810 --> 40:46.845
Oh, shit.

40:48.078 --> 40:49.216
You got it?

40:49.680 --> 40:50.715
Good?

40:56.921 --> 41:01.097
I'm going places with my life.
We're smart fucking dudes, you know?

41:01.158 --> 41:03.399
Look, we're going to
do shit with our lives.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.997
Big shit.

41:05.062 --> 41:06.632
And these fucking dudes...

41:08.299 --> 41:11.337
I love them,
but they're fucking trashy dudes, man.

41:11.402 --> 41:14.815
They suck.
They're just not going anywhere, man.

41:14.872 --> 41:16.977
Brookman's kind of a shitty school.

41:17.041 --> 41:18.748
No, it's not. It's not.

41:21.378 --> 41:22.652
Stand the fuck up.

41:22.713 --> 41:24.750
This is a celebration.
This is a celebration.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.192
- You're good. You're good.
- No, 'cause we're...

41:26.250 --> 41:27.490
Yeah, man, we got you.

41:27.551 --> 41:29.155
- I've known him my whole life.
- That's true.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.666
- And now we're brothers.
- Fucking brothers.

41:31.722 --> 41:34.032
And now we're brothers forever.
Forever, dude.

41:35.259 --> 41:37.068
You know, my dad...

41:37.127 --> 41:39.767
Fuck that guy, man.

41:40.531 --> 41:42.477
That guy hates my fucking guts.

41:46.103 --> 41:47.946
I'm so fucking glad you guys are here.

41:49.406 --> 41:51.079
I'm fucking glad we're here, too, man.

41:51.141 --> 41:52.347
Yo, you guys...

41:53.043 --> 41:54.147
Dude.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.557
You know, I fucking love you guys.

41:58.616 --> 42:00.323
- You good?
- I'm good.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.392
Hey.

42:05.556 --> 42:07.558
- Phi Sig, dude?
- Phi Sig for life.

42:07.625 --> 42:08.968
Phi Sigma.

42:09.793 --> 42:11.136
Phi Sigma.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.574
Hello?

42:22.640 --> 42:25.587
Get your ugly goat-ass to the house
in 11 minutes or you're dead.

42:25.643 --> 42:26.713
What?

42:56.640 --> 42:58.415
You started on the wrong foot, goats.

43:00.377 --> 43:02.584
You're all late.

43:04.682 --> 43:09.961
If any one of you are ever late again,
I will rip your shriveled balls off

43:10.020 --> 43:12.557
and shove them down
your fucking esophagus.

43:12.623 --> 43:14.159
Is that understood?

43:16.226 --> 43:17.933
I said, "Is that understood?"

43:17.995 --> 43:21.135
I wanna hear you say, "Sir, yes, sir!"

43:21.198 --> 43:22.643
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

43:25.736 --> 43:27.238
I am your pledge master.

43:29.340 --> 43:30.751
And you

43:31.642 --> 43:33.144
are my bitches.

43:34.044 --> 43:35.352
Is that understood?

43:35.412 --> 43:36.720
Sir, yes, sir!

43:42.419 --> 43:45.593
Don't you fucking look at them.
You look at me and only me.

43:46.190 --> 43:49.603
When I see Dave Reed,
I don't wanna see Dave fucking Reed.

43:49.660 --> 43:51.697
I wanna see a mesh

43:54.298 --> 43:55.936
of all your faces

43:57.267 --> 43:58.644
in one.

44:01.372 --> 44:02.817
One pledge.

44:05.109 --> 44:06.611
Look at me, goat.

44:07.344 --> 44:10.951
One pledge of the Phi Sigma Mu.

44:15.853 --> 44:18.857
Let me hear your motherfucking pledge!

44:18.922 --> 44:21.129
All my strength is in my union.

44:21.191 --> 44:23.398
All my danger is in discord.

44:23.460 --> 44:25.838
Therefore, be at peace henceforth.

44:25.896 --> 44:27.807
As brothers live together.

44:30.034 --> 44:32.241
Good. Very good.

44:39.643 --> 44:41.623
Welcome to Hell Week, goats!

44:58.962 --> 45:00.066
Now!

45:01.565 --> 45:02.908
Go, go, go, go!

45:02.966 --> 45:03.967
Let's go!

45:04.034 --> 45:05.035
Drink it.

45:05.736 --> 45:07.374
Come on, you fucking faggots.

45:08.539 --> 45:09.882
What the fuck did you swallow?

45:09.940 --> 45:11.510
Go, go, go, go!

45:12.443 --> 45:13.444
Hurry the fuck up.

45:17.681 --> 45:19.160
Drink.

45:19.216 --> 45:21.321
Quick! Drink! Drink! Drink!

45:22.786 --> 45:23.890
Drink.

45:24.421 --> 45:25.923
Drink that shit!

45:26.790 --> 45:27.825
Look at me.

45:27.891 --> 45:29.393
You have no friends.

45:29.460 --> 45:32.532
Nobody's fucking looking out for you.
Nobody fucking loves you.

45:32.596 --> 45:34.940
Say, "I'm a faggot and nobody loves me."

45:34.998 --> 45:37.000
I'm a faggot and nobody loves me.

45:37.067 --> 45:38.341
- Say it again.
- Why the fuck, you ass.

45:38.402 --> 45:40.006
I'm a faggot and nobody likes me.

45:40.070 --> 45:41.572
Say it like you mean it, though.
Say it with feeling.

45:41.638 --> 45:42.742
I'm a faggot and nobody likes me.

45:42.806 --> 45:45.252
Open your fucking mouth!
Turn your head to me right now!

45:45.309 --> 45:47.118
You're gonna drink, motherfucker!

45:47.177 --> 45:48.247
Pushups!

45:48.312 --> 45:50.952
I don't let no
weak motherfuckers in my frat!

45:51.014 --> 45:52.288
Get the fuck up.

45:52.349 --> 45:53.453
Against the fucking wall.

45:56.286 --> 45:57.424
Headstands!

45:57.488 --> 45:58.967
Get your fucking knees up!

45:59.022 --> 46:00.865
Get your fucking knees up!

46:00.924 --> 46:02.995
Spread the fuck out, you faggots.

46:03.060 --> 46:05.301
Get the fuck away from him.
You wanna go on a date with him?

46:05.362 --> 46:06.568
Spread the fuck over!

46:07.798 --> 46:09.937
Get back. Take it, take it, take it.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.502
Are you having a good time?

46:11.568 --> 46:13.775
Sir, no, sir. Sir, no, sir.

46:13.837 --> 46:15.680
On the ground! Face on the ground!

46:16.807 --> 46:19.720
- Just one sip.
- Dave Reed, go!

46:27.184 --> 46:29.186
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

46:35.726 --> 46:37.728
Get it over here! Hurry the fuck up!

46:39.630 --> 46:41.234
Bring it down. Here we go, Brad.

46:41.298 --> 46:42.299
Sir, no, sir!

46:42.399 --> 46:43.400
Get it, dick-licker.

46:48.472 --> 46:49.644
That was cute.

46:51.775 --> 46:54.881
That's one, you guys.
We got a whole barrel full.

46:55.813 --> 46:58.089
I wanna hear, "Thank you, sir.
May I please have another?"

46:58.148 --> 47:00.958
Thank you, sir.
May I please have another?

47:04.021 --> 47:06.399
Here we go. Nice, cute smiles.

47:06.456 --> 47:08.800
Guantanamo style. There we go.

47:10.494 --> 47:11.495
Got it.

47:11.562 --> 47:12.700
Fitch the bitch.

47:14.398 --> 47:15.706
He's fucking gone.

47:15.766 --> 47:17.473
- You're gonna puke, bro?
- Sir, no, sir.

47:17.534 --> 47:19.241
- Are you sure?
- Sir, no, sir.

47:19.303 --> 47:21.579
If you lie to me,
I'm gonna do terrible shit to you.

47:21.638 --> 47:23.515
Sir, no, sir.

47:23.574 --> 47:24.678
That wasn't a question.

47:25.676 --> 47:29.624
All right, motherfucker.
You ready? Don't you puke.

47:33.650 --> 47:35.152
I think he's actually gonna be good.

47:39.890 --> 47:41.062
Not fucking cool.

47:41.124 --> 47:44.298
Get in the cage. Get in the fucking cage.

47:44.361 --> 47:45.772
Get in the cage, now.

47:46.330 --> 47:47.331
Fucker.

47:48.365 --> 47:50.902
Lick that shit off my shirt. Faggot!

47:50.968 --> 47:52.311
Yeah, lock that shit.

47:54.738 --> 47:56.945
That's fucking disgusting, man.

48:02.679 --> 48:05.285
Everybody else, against the wall.
Get against the wall.

48:06.617 --> 48:08.619
Give me that. Give me that.

48:10.053 --> 48:11.862
- Come on.
- Fitch the bitch.

48:11.922 --> 48:13.560
- Go in the cage.
- Fitch the bitch.

48:13.624 --> 48:15.763
You thirsty? You thirsty?

48:17.661 --> 48:19.937
You like them golden showers, boy?

48:20.864 --> 48:22.434
Look at those golden showers.

48:30.540 --> 48:31.746
Hey, get that side as well.

48:31.808 --> 48:33.446
Rock a bye, Fitch bitch

48:33.510 --> 48:34.648
Fuck you.

48:34.711 --> 48:35.951
Rock a bye, Fitch

48:36.013 --> 48:37.219
Good night.

48:37.281 --> 48:39.454
Rock a bye, Fitch bitch

49:06.443 --> 49:09.754
Morning, goats.
Time to get the fuck out of our house.

49:14.952 --> 49:17.626
Get the fuck out of our house! Let's go!

49:17.688 --> 49:19.065
Get the fuck up!

49:19.790 --> 49:21.633
Get the fuck out of here!

49:39.009 --> 49:41.011
Brad, get the fuck up!

49:49.853 --> 49:50.957
Get the fuck up!

50:43.240 --> 50:45.117
Let me ask you a question.
What the fuck happened in there?

50:46.043 --> 50:47.454
I don't fucking know, dude.

50:49.980 --> 50:52.654
Okay. Well, Dixon's looking
for a reason to kick your ass out today.

50:52.716 --> 50:54.024
Okay? It's just I cheated for you.

50:54.418 --> 50:56.364
- What?
- This shit cannot happen.

50:56.420 --> 50:58.957
Dude, I didn't fucking
ask for your help in there.

50:59.523 --> 51:01.730
I didn't ask for your help.

51:01.792 --> 51:03.032
Look, I wouldn't do this myself, all right?

51:03.093 --> 51:05.733
They just fucking do this
to weed out the weak ones.

51:06.797 --> 51:08.435
Show them you mean business.
Show them you wanna be here.

51:08.498 --> 51:09.772
Okay.

51:09.833 --> 51:11.835
All right? You got to be tougher.

51:12.936 --> 51:14.973
- You can do this, dude.
- I know. I...

51:16.239 --> 51:17.309
I fucking will be.

51:17.374 --> 51:18.512
- Come on. Let's go.
- Good.

51:18.575 --> 51:19.576
All right.

51:38.595 --> 51:40.973
Hey, man. You all right?

51:42.399 --> 51:43.503
No.

51:46.203 --> 51:49.343
I was gonna go get some pizza
if you want to come.

51:52.309 --> 51:53.310
Okay.

51:59.649 --> 52:01.993
Oh, man. Brad.
I didn't know this happened to you.

52:02.052 --> 52:03.531
Shit, dude.

52:16.333 --> 52:19.780
Sick of feeling scared,
like, all the time, you know.

52:29.379 --> 52:31.950
Hey, I'm sorry
that happened to you, man. It's crazy.

52:42.259 --> 52:43.602
Brad?

52:45.529 --> 52:46.803
Brad?

52:47.664 --> 52:48.972
Bradley?

52:50.033 --> 52:51.103
Wake up!

52:51.168 --> 52:52.374
Get this goat.

52:52.435 --> 52:54.415
You know what goats eat, right?
Goats eat shit.

52:57.707 --> 52:58.708
Go.

53:00.443 --> 53:01.820
What? Go back in your room.

53:16.126 --> 53:17.799
It's time to eat shit, goat motherfucker.

53:17.861 --> 53:19.602
No, no, no, no!

53:19.663 --> 53:21.472
What the fuck, dude!

53:21.531 --> 53:22.771
- Get down.
- Fuck!

53:23.533 --> 53:25.137
Shit. What the fuck are you...

53:25.202 --> 53:26.237
Grab it.

53:26.303 --> 53:27.611
- Grab the...
- Fuck that, dude!

53:27.671 --> 53:28.741
Grab the shit.

53:28.805 --> 53:29.875
Grab it.

53:32.809 --> 53:34.914
You're not leaving
till you taste the shit, bitch.

53:34.978 --> 53:36.116
- Get the...
- Eat.

53:36.179 --> 53:37.988
Get that shit...

53:38.048 --> 53:39.425
It's just a fucking...

53:41.751 --> 53:43.697
You fucking assholes.

53:47.324 --> 53:48.894
Where's your roommate?
Where's Fitch the bitch, man?

53:48.959 --> 53:50.029
I want my goat.

53:50.093 --> 53:52.539
- He's got fucking class, man.
- Yes!

53:52.596 --> 53:54.234
All right. I got to get to class, too.

53:54.297 --> 53:55.605
Just getting started.

54:07.944 --> 54:09.048
You all right?

54:09.813 --> 54:10.814
Yeah.

54:16.086 --> 54:17.224
Thanks, man.

54:24.027 --> 54:25.097
Lando.

54:26.830 --> 54:27.831
What's up, dude?

54:28.565 --> 54:30.306
We're going to the farm. You...

54:31.268 --> 54:32.372
What are you doing?

54:32.736 --> 54:34.579
What's the farm?
What are you talking about?

54:35.505 --> 54:36.984
Getting the fucking goat, dude.

54:39.075 --> 54:40.782
I thought that was a joke.

54:41.978 --> 54:44.549
No, no. Baity found one this year.
It's fucking happening.

54:46.182 --> 54:47.957
Got it. Got it.

54:51.254 --> 54:53.495
Is this pledge getting weirder this year?

54:54.624 --> 54:55.659
Weirder?

54:57.627 --> 54:59.436
I don't know. Harder?

55:02.599 --> 55:05.375
What... Is that a fucking joke?

55:07.504 --> 55:09.780
No, man. It's just...

55:09.839 --> 55:13.616
J-town put a cigarette out on my ass
last year in front of the Tri Delts.

55:15.145 --> 55:17.648
The pledges got to go through hell,
otherwise what's...

55:17.714 --> 55:19.421
What's the fucking point, right?

55:21.685 --> 55:24.564
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You're right, man.

55:27.457 --> 55:28.458
All right.

56:03.927 --> 56:06.771
- Hustle, bitches.
- Hurry the fuck up!

56:06.830 --> 56:09.071
You boys are gonna
meet your fucking maker.

56:09.132 --> 56:11.237
Step up! Step up! Step up!

56:11.301 --> 56:13.781
This is just the beginning.
You can't be fucking up this hard.

56:13.837 --> 56:15.908
One too many fucking pancakes.

56:20.210 --> 56:21.382
Move your shit!

56:24.414 --> 56:26.018
You're a fucking goat, man.

56:26.850 --> 56:28.796
All right. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

56:30.120 --> 56:31.929
Jesus Christ, you're fucking ugly.

56:36.593 --> 56:37.731
Good.

56:37.794 --> 56:40.536
Straight fucking line, none of this
crooked fruity bullshit. Let's go.

56:41.431 --> 56:42.432
Straight fucking line.

56:42.499 --> 56:45.673
All right, bitches.
We'll play a little game, okay?

56:46.336 --> 56:47.576
Who was

56:48.538 --> 56:51.712
the first president of the United States?

56:51.775 --> 56:53.755
George Washington, sir.

56:53.810 --> 56:55.221
Wrong! Drink.

57:00.083 --> 57:01.994
Who shot John F. Kennedy?

57:03.119 --> 57:04.189
I...

57:04.254 --> 57:05.699
- I don't know...
- Wrong! Drink.

57:08.224 --> 57:09.328
Fuck.

57:09.392 --> 57:10.928
What are the colors

57:13.196 --> 57:14.937
of the American flag?

57:14.998 --> 57:16.272
Red, white and blue, sir!

57:16.332 --> 57:17.504
Wrong!

57:18.935 --> 57:21.142
Hey, I didn't tell you to fucking drink!

57:22.138 --> 57:24.140
Look at me when I'm talking to you, goat.

57:27.210 --> 57:29.190
I want you to slap Brad in his face.

57:29.646 --> 57:30.716
That's your punishment.

57:31.181 --> 57:32.353
No.

57:34.250 --> 57:35.354
What?

57:35.418 --> 57:37.830
Slap Brad in the fucking face.
Are you deaf?

57:38.755 --> 57:40.257
Slap him in the face.

57:40.657 --> 57:41.795
He won't do it.

57:44.661 --> 57:47.540
Holy fuck!
Are you trying to finger fuck it?

57:47.597 --> 57:50.976
I want you to fucking get in there!
Slap his fucking face!

57:55.138 --> 57:56.879
Jesus Christ!

57:56.940 --> 57:59.216
You're just gonna stand there
and let him slap you in the face?

57:59.275 --> 58:02.381
Your balls drop yet? What the fuck!

58:03.813 --> 58:05.986
There you go. Again!

58:06.950 --> 58:08.486
There you fucking go.

58:08.551 --> 58:09.962
Yeah! Yeah!

58:11.287 --> 58:12.288
There you go.

58:12.355 --> 58:14.460
Okay. The goats are worthy now.

58:15.925 --> 58:17.927
Dixon! Fucking stop, dude.

58:19.195 --> 58:21.607
They did it. They fucking did it, okay?

58:24.667 --> 58:25.771
We're good.

58:26.269 --> 58:27.748
- We're good.
- All right.

58:27.804 --> 58:28.908
You guys are good.

58:28.972 --> 58:30.679
Drink. Both of you.

58:55.298 --> 58:58.871
All right, motherfuckers.
Here's what's gonna happen, okay?

58:59.435 --> 59:00.812
You guys look nervous.
You don't have to be nervous.

59:00.870 --> 59:02.543
This is really simple, okay?
We all did this.

59:02.605 --> 59:04.016
Everybody has to do this, okay?

59:04.073 --> 59:05.882
It's really simple.
Here's what's gonna happen.

59:05.942 --> 59:07.512
First you're gonna fuck him,

59:08.444 --> 59:11.516
and then you're gonna kill him, together.

59:11.581 --> 59:13.060
And then we're all gonna eat him.

59:16.886 --> 59:18.126
You ready to fuck a goat?

59:18.187 --> 59:20.360
You think I'm fucking around?

59:20.423 --> 59:22.562
This isn't bullshit, man.
You ready to fuck a goat?

59:22.625 --> 59:24.366
Take your pants off.

59:24.427 --> 59:27.704
You think I'm fucking around?
Take your pants off.

59:27.764 --> 59:29.505
How are you gonna
fuck a goat with your pants on?

59:29.566 --> 59:30.601
They don't have dicks.

59:30.667 --> 59:33.170
Tell me, Dave. How are you
gonna fuck a goat with your pants on?

59:33.236 --> 59:34.237
I don't know, sir.

59:34.304 --> 59:36.716
You're not.
You're gonna fuck it with your pants off.

59:36.773 --> 59:38.878
Dave's balls are gonna drop today, boys.

59:40.043 --> 59:42.387
You smell like shit.
You guys smell worse than the goat.

59:42.445 --> 59:44.083
Scrub yourself, Dave.

59:44.147 --> 59:45.592
Hey, it's all gonna be worth it.

59:45.648 --> 59:48.322
In the name of Phi Sig, you're cleansed.

59:56.359 --> 59:57.702
Drink out of the fucking bottle.

59:57.760 --> 59:59.239
Go again. Go again.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.401
One more.

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:15.286
A little surprise or a big one?

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:18.522
We got something special in store for you.

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.561
That's my limp dick in your fucking face.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.893
You're gonna fucking suck my fucking dick.

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:24.363
Get the fuck out of...

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.923
Don't you fucking... Stop!
Don't you fucking push against me!

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:28.867
Come on. Shut the fuck up!

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:30.529
You're good at that.

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:32.300
Suck my fucking dick.

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:33.466
You're good at that.

01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:35.008
Look at this fucking faggot.

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:37.374
- You know what's coming?
- A nice little chode.

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.413
- You like chodes?
- Does that remind you of high school?

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.743
- You like chubs?
- Is that what you did?

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.077
Here you go. Come on.

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:45.279
Suck my fucking chode,
you fucking faggot. Come on.

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:47.343
- Open your mouth.
- Fuck this shit, bro.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.855
- "Fuck this shit"?
- Fuck this shit.

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:50.515
Shut the fuck up and suck my dick.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.821
Do it, you fucking pussy!

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:54.919
Come on. Suck my fucking dick.

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:56.895
Phi Sig had a little goat

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:58.864
Little goat, little goat

01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:00.559
Phi Sig had a little goat

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.728
that you will fuck tonight

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.703
Phi Sig had a little goat

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:06.638
Little goat, little goat

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:09.939
Phi Sig had a little goat
that you will fuck tonight

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.637
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:18.643
Get in there. Fucking get in there.

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:20.846
Yeah, lock the fucking door.

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:44.669
All right, you goat fucks.

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:45.838
- On your feet.
- Wake the fuck up.

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:48.849
Let's go. Let's go.

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.441
Up against the wall here. Let's go.

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:52.782
Up against the wall.
Get in the corner. Get in the corner.

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:54.219
Turn the fuck around.

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:59.315
That's it.

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:02.689
Looking good.

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:10.660
Look how fucking Lando loves it.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.747
Get him. Go!

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:34.993
Get the fuck up.

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.494
Yeah!

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.103
Listen up.

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:49.439
You guys have three hours to finish
this keg of fucking warm, delicious beer.

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:51.809
All you gotta do, you gotta
ring that bell when you're done.

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:52.869
Okay?

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.346
If you fail,

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:58.674
I can 100 percent promise you
you're gonna have to fuck this goat.

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:00.977
Start the music.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.420
Go!

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:06.559
Fill it up. Fill it up. Fill it up.

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:07.886
Come on, guys.

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:12.794
- Who else? Who else?
- Give me more.

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:14.996
Come on.

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:20.667
Way to go.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.672
I can't fucking...

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:26.302
Do it.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:49.830
It's fucking tapped.

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:51.830
We tapped it.

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:53.066
It's tapped.

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:55.735
It's tapped!

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:59.240
Two, three...

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:28.170
Yeah!

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:50.715
All right. Shut the fuck up.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.919
Shut the fuck up.
Listen to your pledge master.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.592
Okay.

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.060
You guys just completed Hell Week.

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:04.371
Now you don't have to wear
your pledge shirts anymore.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:08.102
Thank fucking God,
because you guys fucking stink.

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:09.234
Fuck!

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:13.178
However, you're far from brothers. Okay?

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:15.738
You still have the rest of the semester
to be our little bitches.

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:21.913
As you know, this is your bordelia dochet.

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:24.518
Throw King James out the window.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.854
This is your new bible.

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:29.653
Because of the recent accusations

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:32.256
from our Greek brothers
at the Delta Theta Gamma house,

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:34.358
those fucking pussy-ass retards,

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:38.831
we are obligated to read
a passage from this bitch.

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:46.137
"The bordelia dochet maintains
that hazing is fundamentally at odds

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:49.547
"with the ideals of the Phi Sigma Mu.

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:53.143
"Hazing runs contrary
to our core concepts of brotherhood

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:55.052
"and is prohibited in all forms.

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:59.920
"Any activities intended to produce
harassment, embarrassment, blah blah,

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:01.928
"fuck all, will not be tolerated."

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:07.732
Our initiation is
a rite of passage, gentlemen.

01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:09.729
That's all.

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:12.228
Are we clear on that?

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:13.534
Sir, yes, sir.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.531
Okay.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:44.565
I swear allegiance
to God and in Phi Sigma Mu.

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:47.403
All my strength is in my union.

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:50.205
All my danger is in discord.

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:53.270
Therefore, be at peace henceforth.

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:55.542
And as brothers live together.

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:42.955
You ready?

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.821
It was all in good fun, bro.

01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:46.627
- Don't worry.
- Sorry.

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:48.666
Tinsley couldn't make it.

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:50.501
Who?

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:52.232
Tinsley, your big brother.

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:54.103
He had, like, a Spanish exam or something.

01:08:54.162 --> 01:08:55.233
Where's Brett?

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:57.174
Shit, I don't know. You know Brett.

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:00.973
Good job, man.

01:09:04.673 --> 01:09:06.778
Motherfucker. You excited?

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:08.479
I wanna see you smile.

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:11.649
Yeah? There we go.
That's a fucking smile.

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:17.787
Hey, what's up, man?

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:21.633
What's wrong with you?

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:25.367
Nothing, really. It's just...

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.100
I don't think they're gonna let me in.

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.233
What are you talking about?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.377
Of course you're gonna get in.
We both are.

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:37.879
Why would they give me Chance,
though, you know?

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:39.317
The dude literally hates me.

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:41.048
He said to my face
that I don't belong here.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:42.282
Fuck him.

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:45.649
It's not his decision, man.
All the brothers vote equally.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:49.924
I just feel like a pussy.
The dude scares the shit out of me.

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:52.060
Maybe you should just quit.

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:53.292
I can't quit.

01:09:53.788 --> 01:09:55.029
Why not?

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:56.660
The same reason you can't quit.

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:58.705
I have no fucking idea why I don't quit.

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.866
Yeah, you do. Everybody does.

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:03.069
Dude, if you quit, what else is there?

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:05.840
You know? You're just another guy
that couldn't hack it.

01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:08.142
And then, everywhere you go,
everyone's gonna know that.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.774
That's not true.

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:14.014
Bullshit. Yeah, you can't even go to
a party on campus without seeing them.

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:15.419
It's just the way it is.

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:18.415
I'm having sex
for the first time in my life.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.188
You know, I'm not stupid.
Brad, that's not because of me.

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:24.254
You know, if the fraternity goes,
everything goes with it.

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:27.933
Don't give up, man.

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:31.166
Hey, we just got pinned, right?

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:35.704
We're fine. We're fine.

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:39.973
Where you going?

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:43.010
To clear my head.

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.051
I'll see you back at the room.

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:00.760
What's up, man?

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:08.530
Hey.

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.372
What's your fucking problem, man?

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.102
What?

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:15.472
"What"?

01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:17.710
Why are you acting like
such a fucking asshole to me?

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:19.615
Whatever, dude.

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:22.052
No, I'm fucking serious, man.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.146
Why, 'cause I didn't feel like coming

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.282
to some fucking bullshit ceremony?

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:27.054
Why the fuck was Wes the one
pinning me tonight and not you?

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.186
You're lucky it was Wes.

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.820
They wanted to give you Dixon
and I stopped them.

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:32.627
What, you think I can't
fucking handle Dixon? Is...

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:34.462
Fuck you, man.

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:38.134
You are un-fucking-believable.

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:39.672
Can you get out of my room now, please?

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:42.072
No. Not until you tell me
what's going on with you.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:44.543
Nothing's going on. Nothing.

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:47.308
This shit doesn't fucking matter.
That's what you don't get.

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:49.280
Okay? None of this shit matters at all.

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:51.284
This shit fucking matters to me!

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.445
- Don't fucking push me.
- What are you gonna do?

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:55.147
You gonna fucking kick my ass?

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:56.883
- I'm not gonna fight you, Brad.
- Why not? Why not?

01:11:56.945 --> 01:12:00.324
- Just fucking say it, God damn it!
- 'Cause you don't belong here.

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:02.792
You don't fucking belong here.

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:05.894
This is not for you.

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:12.662
Okay.

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:14.537
- Hey.
- No, that's what I thought.

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:01.381
Give me some room. Give me some room.

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.424
Can't let Baity win.

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:10.020
Land, you goat fuck.

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:11.689
You're a dead man.
Get up against the wall.

01:13:11.754 --> 01:13:13.927
- No.
- I'm sorry. I think...

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:16.435
There's something in my fucking ear.
What did you say to me?

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:17.937
Fuck you, I'm not doing that.

01:13:17.993 --> 01:13:20.633
I'm not asking. You do it,
or you're fucking out of here.

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:23.472
Land, are you being a naughty goat?

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:27.937
Shit!

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:29.073
Head shot, bitches.

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:31.584
100 points. Mark it, Baity, you fat fuck.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.914
Don't just stand there.

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:35.919
- What?
- I think he's really hurt.

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:38.523
You all right, man?

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.581
You all right, buddy?

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:41.984
He's fine.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:43.529
You okay, buddy?

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:45.326
You're a fucking asshole, man.

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:48.226
What the fuck did you
think was gonna happen?

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:50.702
Dude, I'm fine. Dude, it's cool. Come on.

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:51.863
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.429
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, dude.

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:54.940
Chill the fuck out, brother.

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:58.767
It's cool.

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:32.744
- Hello?
- Is this Brad Land?

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:33.905
Who is this?

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:36.745
Yeah, this is Detective Burke
with the Dawson Police Department.

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.648
Look, I've left you several messages.

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.084
We really need you
to come down to the station.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.383
Yeah, yeah. I know. I got your message.

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:44.355
Well, look. I really think we may have

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:46.893
one of the guys that
assaulted you last summer.

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:50.792
Mr. Land? Are you there?

01:14:50.853 --> 01:14:52.924
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:55.093
Yeah, do you think it would be possible
for you to come today?

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:56.761
Today? No.

01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:58.463
Okay. How about tomorrow?

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:00.131
No, I can't.

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:01.833
Brad, listen. I know this is tough. But...

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.706
Look, I'm sorry. I just can't.

01:15:22.584 --> 01:15:24.325
Brad. What's going on?

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:28.926
Hey. I'll be back.

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:32.464
What's going on, dude?
I got to get back to work.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:33.529
All right.

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:38.510
The cops found them, Brett. They want
me to fucking come in and ID them.

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:40.712
All right. We'll go back
to Dawson tomorrow.

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:42.339
No, I'm not going.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.247
What do you mean? You have to go back.

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:47.480
No, I can't.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.614
Brad, you have to ID them.

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:51.555
- To fucking punish them.
- No.

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:53.957
Dude, it's taken me six months
to get away from this shit.

01:15:54.016 --> 01:15:56.121
I'm not gonna go back now.

01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:57.288
Fuck.

01:15:58.687 --> 01:15:59.893
I did this.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:02.497
What? No.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:03.764
Yeah. I made you fucking come here.

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:05.270
I made you join this fucking fraternity.

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.670
- No!
- Yes.

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.298
If I would've just
gone home with you that night,

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:09.398
none of this shit would have happened.

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:10.499
What are you talking about?

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:11.874
That doesn't have
anything to do with this shit.

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.538
It has to do with you, Brad.

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:16.139
Okay? And how fucked up everything
has been between us since the summer.

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:19.011
I'm not gonna quit the frat, okay?

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:22.512
I'm not letting those guys
lay another fucking hand on you.

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:24.620
Brett.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.093
This is not your decision, okay?

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:32.893
I'm gonna go.

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:34.859
Brad.

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:53.979
Knock, knock.

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:55.814
Errand time, Willie.

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.413
Shit. Yeah, I forgot.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.488
What's up?

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.755
I need...

01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:04.388
I need one egg roll from Yang's Palace.

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:08.530
But not the one on main street, all right?
You gotta go all the way to the airport.

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:10.729
Okay? Don't fuck around.
I can tell the difference.

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.135
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
- All right.

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:13.964
You want anything, Baity?

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:16.600
I don't know. Let me see a menu.

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:25.147
How do you pronounce that one?

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:29.914
What are you doing?

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:33.354
Let go of his arms. Let go of his arms.

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:42.196
That's fucking incredible.

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:44.737
You got to go get that egg roll, buddy.
You got an hour.

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:46.534
Go, hustle. Hustle.

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:03.916
Fuck.

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:09.375
What are you doing?

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.451
Just cleaning up his shit.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.125
I know. It's crazy, man.

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:22.789
We hardly even knew him, you know.

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:24.795
I knew him.

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:27.927
He was my roommate.

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:36.374
I just feel like
he didn't deserve this, you know.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.447
No, he just had a bad heart, dude.

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:56.157
You wanna stay at the house tonight?

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:59.522
Don't you feel like
that'd be better than being here?

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.233
Okay.

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:01.850
Hey, Brad.

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.422
Hey, man.

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.630
- Hey, man. How you doing?
- Good.

01:22:08.690 --> 01:22:10.192
- You doing all right?
- Yeah.

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:12.229
Oh, man.

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:14.865
This must be so hard for you.
I can't even imagine.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.434
I can't fucking imagine, man.
It's been terrible. Buddy, I mean...

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:22.506
Dude, you know,

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:24.709
if you ever want to talk to anybody
or anything like that...

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:26.411
If you ever want to get
anything off your chest,

01:22:26.474 --> 01:22:27.851
- you know I'm here for you, right?
- Yeah.

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:29.650
- About anything. I'm here for you.
- Thanks, dude.

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:30.849
Thanks, Chance. Yeah.

01:22:30.912 --> 01:22:32.016
Yeah, of course, man.

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.493
We're actually doing a little thing.

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:36.495
We're doing a get-together
tonight at the house.

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:38.462
Just brothers only, just to chat.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.227
No drinking or anything. Just to talk.

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:41.699
Just trying to deal
about what we're feeling.

01:22:41.756 --> 01:22:44.396
Yeah, I don't think
I can come tonight, Chance.

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:46.302
I just think it's important
that we're all there, man.

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:48.034
That's all. Or else I wouldn't ask.

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:50.269
I just think it's important
that we're with all the brothers.

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:52.005
You know what I mean?

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:53.512
Yeah, all right.

01:22:53.568 --> 01:22:55.844
Okay, man. Okay.

01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:58.981
Hey, I love you. All right? Hang in there.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.212
- Yeah.
- See you tonight, okay?

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:01.583
- Okay. You, too. Okay.
- I love you.

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:02.678
- Yeah.
- See you tonight.

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:17.898
What's up? Did he call you?

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:20.803
He said the fucking school's
putting us on probation.

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:25.042
What does that mean, man?
What does probation mean?

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.477
It doesn't fucking mean anything yet.

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:29.743
Okay? It just means they're
launching an investigation.

01:23:31.306 --> 01:23:34.082
We'll all probably have to
go in and, you know,

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:35.951
fucking talk to the provost.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.456
What the fuck?

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:40.118
He wasn't even here. He died on campus.

01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:41.660
Yeah, well, someone must have told them

01:23:41.716 --> 01:23:43.024
about the concussion. Right, Baity?

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:44.791
No, it wasn't a concussion, man.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.264
We gotta stop saying that.

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:47.629
We need to stop saying that.

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:49.997
He went to the infirmary.

01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:52.503
They know that it happened in the house.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.437
- Who's telling them this shit, dude?
- I don't fucking know.

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:56.442
This is serious.
They could kick us out of school.

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:57.636
This is serious.

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.337
Okay. I don't know
who's fucking telling them this.

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:00.505
Okay?

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:04.410
- Fuck! Sorry.
- Look...

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:06.513
I'm sorry.

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:07.917
We need to huddle up on this shit.

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:09.284
I know. Yeah.

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:12.725
All right? We can't be telling them
anything that they don't even know.

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:14.556
I'm not gonna fucking lie to them.

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:16.789
If I lose my scholarship,
my dad's gonna fucking kill me.

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:19.229
No one's fucking telling you to lie, Baity.

01:24:19.821 --> 01:24:21.357
Look, we haven't been doing anything

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:24.927
that every other fraternity on campus
hasn't been doing for the last...

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.729
What?

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:29.207
Fucking a hundred years.

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:30.641
- Yeah, I know, dude. I know.
- A hundred years.

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:31.938
- Right?
- I know.

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:35.612
- Right?
- Yeah. Right.

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:39.815
If you don't have an answer,

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:42.653
just say, "I don't know."

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:57.830
Just keep your fucking mouth shut, Baity.

01:25:04.299 --> 01:25:06.074
I'll talk to the pledges.

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:08.539
Hey.

01:25:08.903 --> 01:25:10.644
Brad didn't show up to the meet-up.

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:56.356
Come on in, Brad.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.318
How you holding up, Brad?

01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:25.214
I'm fine.

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:27.954
You and Will were pledging
together, right?

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.461
Yeah. That's right.

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:32.291
What was that like?

01:26:33.354 --> 01:26:35.925
I don't know. Just normal stuff.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.170
Were they hazing Will?

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:53.208
Come on, man.

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:55.276
They were beating the crap
out of him, right?

01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:57.520
What do you think? I mean...

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:00.887
Just normal pledge term stuff.

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.590
You've been here a while.

01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:06.557
I mean, I don't understand what...

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:10.327
Right? He was running on the track.
It was a heart attack.

01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:11.927
He had bruises all over his body.

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:17.141
He went to the infirmary for
a head injury the week before he died.

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:20.737
Now, it's the school's responsibility

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:22.782
to keep this kind of thing from happening.

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:26.114
It's my duty to make sure
that this kind of behavior stops.

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:27.710
And you know what?
It's your responsibility...

01:27:27.775 --> 01:27:31.348
It's my responsibility, it's your duty...
Will's dead. He's dead.

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:34.523
Okay? I don't know what else to tell you.

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:38.825
Brad, just tell me what happened.

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:58.116
Dude. Where have you been, man?
I've been looking everywhere for you.

01:27:58.172 --> 01:27:59.276
Okay?

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:00.512
What are we gonna do?

01:28:00.575 --> 01:28:02.054
I don't know.
What are you talking about?

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:04.681
The fraternity just got suspended
for the rest of the year.

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:06.050
What?

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:08.321
Yeah. Somebody fucking talked, dude.
It's over.

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:11.019
It wasn't you, was it?

01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:12.754
No.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:16.735
I mean, what the fuck was all that for?
Dude, we never even got in.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.896
Dude, I had offers, like, anywhere.
All right?

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.803
I could have pledged
anywhere at this school.

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:22.899
I don't even care if it sounds
like bragging at this point.

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:25.774
This is fucked up, dude. All of that for...

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:29.280
Fuck!

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:37.756
Oh, my God!

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:50.294
It's fucking laxatives, dude.

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:53.801
Fuck that, dude.

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:57.135
Fuck!

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:45.189
- Yo, Chance.
- Who the fuck did that?

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:47.993
I don't know what
you're talking about, rat.

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.087
- Where's Brett?
- No, no.

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:52.997
You're not talking
to your brother right now.

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:54.795
You're talking to Baity
and you're talking to me.

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:56.699
Okay. Get out of my way.
I need to speak to my brother.

01:29:56.758 --> 01:29:58.465
Can I ask you a serious question?

01:29:58.526 --> 01:30:00.528
Can I ask you a serious question?

01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:03.576
Where do you get the fucking balls
to show your face in this house

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:04.666
after you ratted on me?

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:06.507
I didn't fucking rat on you.

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:09.514
Shit. You're gonna lie to me?
You're gonna fucking lie to me?

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:11.709
We know it was you.
Just fucking admit it.

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:12.979
No.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.815
Admit you're the rat,
or I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:15.946
How about that?

01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:17.353
I'm not a fucking rat.

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:21.155
What are you gonna do, dude?

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:24.162
What are you gonna do?

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:26.289
You're gonna lie to me?
What are you gonna do?

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:28.197
- You're gonna lie to me?
- Chance! Chill the fuck out.

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:29.496
No, dude. No. Fuck you.

01:30:29.557 --> 01:30:31.002
No, no. Your brother's done, man.

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:32.560
- Leave him alone.
- No, I don't care, man.

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:33.901
He's fucking done.

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:36.305
I love you. But actually
you might wanna go upstairs.

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:37.809
Actually you might wanna go upstairs.

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:39.902
- 'Cause I'm gonna lay in...
- Don't you fucking touch him.

01:30:39.967 --> 01:30:44.677
Fuck you, man! I helped his ass
after he got his fucking ass beat.

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:47.310
I got him into this fucking class, man.

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:49.981
I stuck my neck out
for this fucking pussy.

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.786
And now, dude, he fucking
ratted on us, man!

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:55.157
Your brother's a rat.
How do you feel about that?

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:57.753
- How do you feel about that?
- No, he's not.

01:30:58.820 --> 01:30:59.924
I am.

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:01.856
What?

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:04.335
I fucking told them everything. All right?

01:31:04.959 --> 01:31:06.165
What did you say?

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:07.638
This shit doesn't fucking matter.

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:09.174
Okay? None of it.

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:11.335
I don't care anymore.
I just don't fucking care.

01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:12.605
It's all fucking bullshit.

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:13.907
Someone's fucking dead.

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:15.072
You're a piece of shit.

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:16.911
- Hold on.
- Don't you fucking touch me.

01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:18.075
I'll kick your fucking ass.

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:19.447
- Chill out, bro.
- What you gonna do?

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.282
You're a pussy like your faggot brother.

01:31:21.342 --> 01:31:22.685
What are you gonna do?

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:29.761
Motherfucker.

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:31.728
Brett, come on.
What the fuck are you doing?

01:31:40.728 --> 01:31:42.036
Yo, what the fuck?

01:31:46.734 --> 01:31:48.839
- I'm fucking done.
- Come on. Come on.

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:51.074
You okay?

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:32.757
Hey, fellas.
Can I see Brad just for a second?

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:35.893
- How are you?
- Hi.

01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:38.294
Hey, listen. Before we go in,
I wanted to show you something.

01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:43.725
That's one of the guys, isn't it?

01:32:47.161 --> 01:32:49.300
So last week, he makes bail.

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:52.173
That night he goes out
and tries to rob a gas station.

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:56.009
Shot three times in the chest.

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:04.583
The guy's already in there.

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:07.785
Before we go in, though,
I want you to think back on that night.

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:10.723
Any detail you can remember.

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:12.992
Anything about their face,
anything about their body.

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:15.364
Any distinguishing marks
that might help you identify him.

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:16.458
All right?

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:18.435
All right. Let's do this.

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:28.776
Remember. They can't see you.
So just take your time.

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:31.341
When you're ready...

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:34.987
Tell me if you recognize any one of them.

01:34:04.338 --> 01:34:05.408
No.

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.951
Are you sure?

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:12.583
Yeah, I don't see him here.

01:34:15.516 --> 01:34:16.995
Well.

01:34:18.452 --> 01:34:23.458
We can actually place one of them
in the vicinity that night.

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:28.967
So are you sure
you don't wanna take your time?

01:34:31.098 --> 01:34:32.634
Yeah, I don't see him.

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:39.511
Okay.

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:07.812
Did you let that guy off?

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:13.714
I don't know.

01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:24.860
They all look the same, you know.

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:41.780
None of this is your fault, you know.

01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:39.128
This is the spot.
