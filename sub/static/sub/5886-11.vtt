<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

00:02.624 --> 00:05.672
I assumed that we were
forgetting about that.

00:05.821 --> 00:07.488
Well, I haven't.

00:07.498 --> 00:08.964
His name is Manolo ColÃ³n.

00:09.091 --> 00:11.488
He's an army trained
registered nurse.

00:11.621 --> 00:14.374
Is he Spanish from Spain?
Because otherwise, Mother will refuse.

00:14.943 --> 00:16.161
You know, we're losing the war.

00:16.514 --> 00:18.210
Wouldn't know it
from looking around here.

00:18.407 --> 00:20.096
Yeah, it's something, right?

00:20.568 --> 00:23.609
I am going to continue on Chevy
evaluating other people's work.

00:24.109 --> 00:25.502
That's all I can do right now.

00:26.940 --> 00:29.664
Call me around 1970 when
they're ready to make an ad.

01:22.053 --> 01:26.432
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
Mr. Sterling's inside.

01:26.433 --> 01:27.623
<i>( glasses rattling )</i>

01:27.624 --> 01:29.825
- Do you want ice?
- Coffee.

01:33.964 --> 01:36.199
It's one thing to be near the bar,
it's another thing to be under it.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.944
Sunkist sent us a crate.

01:38.945 --> 01:42.013
I've seen blind people juggle, but
somehow it seems to be beyond me.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.105
Why don't you
just close your eyes?

01:43.106 --> 01:44.576
That's what you did
in the meeting.

01:44.577 --> 01:46.143
Whatever I did, it worked.

01:46.144 --> 01:47.809
- We're in it.
- That's good news.

01:47.810 --> 01:49.244
Step one,
I send it to research.

01:49.245 --> 01:52.447
Step two, you'll need to get that
little idea factory working.

01:52.448 --> 01:54.249
There's only one angle.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.384
An orange--
that's orange on TV.

01:57.385 --> 02:00.064
I thought they were pretty clear
they're too cheap to get out of print.

02:00.065 --> 02:01.888
So talk 'em out of it,
or into it.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.958
I'd love to, but I think it
demands a media strategy.

02:04.959 --> 02:08.229
Forget research.
Put Harry Crane on it.

02:09.598 --> 02:11.332
- Look at you.
- See?

02:11.333 --> 02:13.500
Not all surprises are bad.

02:20.874 --> 02:24.416
( chuckles ) The ants,
they look like peoples.

02:24.417 --> 02:27.453
He should be right out. Is
there anything I can get you?

02:27.454 --> 02:29.181
I think she would
like a cup of tea.

02:29.182 --> 02:30.949
- In a teacup.
- Peter: <i>I'd be more excited</i>

02:30.950 --> 02:33.918
if we didn't have to go
in Ted's plane to present.

02:33.919 --> 02:36.800
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Peter.

02:36.801 --> 02:39.236
Manolo, may I speak
with you a moment?

02:39.237 --> 02:41.893
Of course, Mr. Campbell.
Your tea is coming.

02:41.894 --> 02:44.328
I'll be fine.
I'm not a child.

02:46.532 --> 02:48.366
Peggy, would you mind?

02:51.170 --> 02:53.671
Mrs. Campbell,
nice to meet you.

02:53.672 --> 02:56.544
There's no reason for you
to be so formal, dear.

02:56.545 --> 02:59.109
Sit with me.

03:03.847 --> 03:05.216
How are you today?

03:05.217 --> 03:07.150
I can't tell you
how much it relieves me

03:07.151 --> 03:09.452
to see you and Peter reunited.

03:09.453 --> 03:12.422
Well, it was really
a by-product of the merger.

03:12.423 --> 03:14.558
I'm glad you both
swallowed your pride.

03:14.559 --> 03:16.768
If nothing else
but for the good

03:16.769 --> 03:19.036
of the child you have together.

03:21.507 --> 03:22.973
Excuse me?

03:22.974 --> 03:26.502
Oh, I've embarrassed you.

03:26.503 --> 03:29.280
Your son and I are not
together that way.

03:29.281 --> 03:31.207
Trudy, dear, don't deny him.

03:31.208 --> 03:34.475
Don't reject his caresses.

03:34.476 --> 03:35.710
Mrs. Campbell--

03:35.711 --> 03:38.379
I hope you two can someday find

03:38.380 --> 03:41.120
what Manolo and I have found.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.591
I waited long enough

03:45.592 --> 03:49.761
to experience the physical
satisfactions of love.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.568
Did she go
to China for that tea?

03:58.270 --> 04:00.505
Thank you for driving
her out to Bud's.

04:00.506 --> 04:02.536
I've paid you
for the extra day.

04:02.537 --> 04:04.416
- I know you don't drive.
- Well, I do,

04:04.417 --> 04:07.806
but not to her satisfaction.

04:07.807 --> 04:10.816
Bob Benson was right about you.
You're worth every penny.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.845
Bob is a wonderful salesman.

04:12.846 --> 04:15.648
Still, I want you to have a
little something off the books.

04:15.649 --> 04:17.516
Mr. Campbell,
I refuse.

04:17.517 --> 04:19.785
It's important to me
that you treat my mother well,

04:19.786 --> 04:21.886
but also
that you treat yourself.

04:21.887 --> 04:25.189
- The pleasure is all mine.
- I know that isn't true.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.343
Sally, get in here.

04:34.344 --> 04:36.134
- <i>( door opens )</i>
<i>- Henry: Hello.</i>

04:38.304 --> 04:40.704
- What?
- Julie's mother called and told me

04:40.705 --> 04:43.073
- you were the only two girls on the trip.
- So?

04:43.074 --> 04:45.952
You're not staying in a Midtown
hotel with all those boys.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.878
Miss O'Shea is gonna be there.

04:47.879 --> 04:49.280
She's 25.

04:49.281 --> 04:51.424
What's the point
of having a mansion

04:51.425 --> 04:53.383
if you're gonna spend
all your time in here?

04:53.384 --> 04:55.685
Fine, I won't do the Model UN.

04:55.686 --> 04:58.336
- It was his idea.
- Fine, you're not going.

04:58.337 --> 05:00.739
- Can't we stay with Daddy?
- You mean with no one.

05:00.740 --> 05:03.275
You hate that Daddy
supports my dreams.

05:03.276 --> 05:07.178
He doesn't think I'm
just a pain in the ass.

05:07.179 --> 05:09.547
Your father is a hero.

05:09.548 --> 05:11.533
( sighs ) Like everything
else in this country,

05:11.648 --> 05:14.850
Diplomacy Club's just
another excuse to make out.

05:14.851 --> 05:16.971
I thought she should join
the Student Congress.

05:16.972 --> 05:18.784
The UN's a joke.

05:23.145 --> 05:26.048
- Oh, you're home.
- Who's this?

05:26.049 --> 05:28.716
This is Mitchell,
Sylvia and Arnold's son.

05:30.719 --> 05:33.321
Nice to finally meet you, Mitchell.
I'm Don.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.559
Thanks again, Megan.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.935
What did he want?

05:47.936 --> 05:50.370
( sighs ) Um...

05:50.371 --> 05:54.080
I'm sworn to secrecy, but
he's in a lot of trouble.

05:54.949 --> 05:58.651
- What happened?
- He's 1-A.

05:58.652 --> 06:00.580
But he's in school.

06:00.581 --> 06:02.464
He sent back his draft card

06:02.465 --> 06:05.767
in protest.
They reclassified him.

06:05.768 --> 06:07.335
What did he think
was gonna happen?

06:07.336 --> 06:08.455
Stupid kid.

06:08.456 --> 06:10.790
Don, he knows he screwed up.

06:10.791 --> 06:13.125
He wants to run.

06:13.126 --> 06:16.161
You know, to Canada.

06:16.162 --> 06:17.763
I suppose I could
call my brother-in-law,

06:17.764 --> 06:19.808
but I can't do that
to Sylvia and Arnold.

06:19.809 --> 06:23.068
- Can I?
- Just leave it alone.

06:23.069 --> 06:25.471
- He's so scared.
- He should be.

06:29.675 --> 06:32.844
He can't spend the rest
of his life on the run.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.394
I know how you feel,

06:35.395 --> 06:37.482
but you don't want him
to go to Vietnam.

06:37.483 --> 06:39.617
Megan, it's not our problem.

06:43.424 --> 06:45.889
- <i>( plane engines whirring )</i>
<i>- ( laughing )</i>

06:45.890 --> 06:47.691
Could you get me
another whiskey sour?

06:47.692 --> 06:50.660
- Sure.
- Maybe I'll switch to whiskey sours.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.061
How about
a Shirley Temple, then?

06:52.062 --> 06:55.136
I don't think Dramamine
and booze go together.

06:55.137 --> 06:57.472
I don't think Dramamine and cranberry
juice go together, either.

06:57.473 --> 06:58.940
But I thought we'd be back
on your little plane,

06:58.941 --> 07:00.970
not having a romantic dinner.

07:00.971 --> 07:02.848
Don't you want to celebrate?

07:02.849 --> 07:04.072
I want to live, Ted.

07:04.073 --> 07:05.674
( laughs ) What?

07:05.792 --> 07:07.777
He doesn't like flying.

07:07.778 --> 07:09.378
Well, you've seen
how simple it is now.

07:09.379 --> 07:10.752
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

07:10.753 --> 07:14.422
My father died
in a plane... crash.

07:14.423 --> 07:17.519
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.200
Was he a pilot?

07:19.201 --> 07:20.869
Ha! No.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.724
Passenger.

07:22.725 --> 07:24.064
Look, you're driving.

07:24.065 --> 07:25.827
Can we please, please
have another round?

07:25.828 --> 07:28.864
You still have to get home
from White Plains.

07:28.865 --> 07:29.997
I'll hail a cab.

07:30.112 --> 07:32.700
( laughs )
He's such a New Yorker.

07:32.701 --> 07:34.976
( sighs )

07:36.771 --> 07:39.339
This is the agency
I always wanted.

07:39.340 --> 07:41.608
Ambition, brains, and beauty.

07:41.609 --> 07:43.744
Yeah, but what about him?

07:43.745 --> 07:46.212
I'm gonna cut you
off too, my dear.

07:49.950 --> 07:53.120
I should call home.

07:53.121 --> 07:55.421
If the check comes, I'm
sending it to Ocean Spray.

08:00.704 --> 08:01.994
Can you imagine what
it does to his wife

08:01.995 --> 08:04.296
every time he takes that plane?

08:04.297 --> 08:06.397
I guess so.

08:06.398 --> 08:09.408
You don't want me
to talk about his wife.

08:09.409 --> 08:10.843
You don't know
what you're talking about.

08:10.844 --> 08:12.704
But I do.

08:12.705 --> 08:15.206
I've seen that look.

08:17.312 --> 08:19.547
I know, but...

08:19.548 --> 08:20.879
( sighs )

08:20.880 --> 08:22.688
nothing can happen.

08:22.689 --> 08:24.882
And he's in love with you, too.

08:26.688 --> 08:28.285
You're the one
who's in love with him.

08:28.286 --> 08:30.788
Well, I could use an account
and he's been generous.

08:35.296 --> 08:38.230
At least one of us
ended up important.

08:39.832 --> 08:42.201
Please tell me
you don't pity me.

08:42.202 --> 08:44.604
I don't.

08:44.605 --> 08:47.073
Because you really know me.

08:50.777 --> 08:53.345
I do.

08:59.318 --> 09:03.652
Ahem--
I should tell you...

09:03.653 --> 09:07.489
I had a very strange
conversation with your mother.

09:07.490 --> 09:09.724
There's no other kind.

09:09.725 --> 09:11.559
( chuckles )

09:11.560 --> 09:13.060
Well, it doesn't matter.

09:13.061 --> 09:15.968
What did she say?

09:15.969 --> 09:19.839
I think she thought
I was your wife

09:19.840 --> 09:24.005
and Manuel was her husband.

09:24.006 --> 09:26.272
( laughs ) My father never
treated her that well.

09:26.273 --> 09:29.856
Maybe that's it. She thinks
she's in love with him.

09:29.857 --> 09:32.191
I can see it.
Manolo is very charming.

09:32.192 --> 09:34.593
I don't think you understand.

09:34.594 --> 09:36.996
She thinks she's...

09:36.997 --> 09:40.253
making love with him.

09:40.254 --> 09:42.888
Tell me exactly what she said.

09:42.889 --> 09:46.336
Did your father ever
give her spa treatments

09:46.337 --> 09:49.606
that released
a "fire in her loins"?

09:49.607 --> 09:52.396
Oh!

09:52.512 --> 09:54.465
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

09:54.466 --> 09:57.769
( laughing ) I'm sorry.

09:57.770 --> 09:59.203
I shouldn't have told you.

09:59.204 --> 10:01.312
But I can't get the image
out of my head.

10:01.313 --> 10:02.714
Stop it, please.

10:02.715 --> 10:05.150
I don't even want to think
about her brushing her teeth.

10:05.151 --> 10:08.285
- <i>( laughing )</i>
<i>- I thought I cut you two off.</i>

10:09.253 --> 10:10.847
Ted.

10:10.848 --> 10:14.432
I have never been less
afraid of flying in my life.

10:15.486 --> 10:17.854
What?
What does he mean?

10:17.855 --> 10:20.290
Nothing.

10:20.291 --> 10:22.725
Well, I should get the check.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.194
- ( TV playing )
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>

10:35.195 --> 10:37.897
Honey, who's that gonna be?

10:44.204 --> 10:45.772
- Arnold.
- Is it too late?

10:45.773 --> 10:49.508
For what?
Come in.

10:49.509 --> 10:52.144
Look, I would have
called, but Sylvia is...

10:53.746 --> 10:56.882
Listen, about
this afternoon--

10:56.883 --> 10:59.584
Oh, hello, Arnold.

10:59.585 --> 11:02.287
I'm sorry about my kid
dropping in on you.

11:02.288 --> 11:03.855
( sighs )

11:03.856 --> 11:06.324
I didn't know
if I should tell you.

11:06.325 --> 11:07.792
Well, he figured you would

11:07.793 --> 11:09.494
and I don't want you
in the middle of this.

11:09.495 --> 11:11.663
His mother's treating it
like he's dying.

11:11.664 --> 11:13.665
She doesn't want
anyone to know.

11:16.101 --> 11:17.635
Do you want a drink?

11:17.636 --> 11:21.306
Sit up here drinking while they're
down there slamming the doors?

11:21.307 --> 11:24.040
( sighs )

11:24.041 --> 11:26.075
Been meaning to knock
on your door anyway.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.211
You know, catch a game
or something.

11:28.212 --> 11:31.648
I get baseball tickets.
Mostly the Mets.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.883
- Well, then I'm glad you didn't.
- ( laughs )

11:37.622 --> 11:40.856
You know, I didn't
even know he left school.

11:40.857 --> 11:43.693
Sylvia says
she didn't know either.

11:44.928 --> 11:46.929
She's doing that
a lot lately--

11:46.930 --> 11:50.265
lying about little things.

11:50.266 --> 11:52.668
Could tell something's
been wrong all year.

11:54.805 --> 11:58.072
- Another Manhattan?
- Nah. No.

11:58.073 --> 12:01.309
Should have never
let him go to Paris.

12:01.310 --> 12:03.911
He got there right in
the middle of the riots.

12:03.912 --> 12:05.814
His French is excellent.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.451
I think he got a lot of girls

12:09.452 --> 12:12.285
as an expatriate revolutionary.

12:12.286 --> 12:14.287
Could kill him right now.

12:15.557 --> 12:16.923
There has to be a way.

12:16.924 --> 12:19.226
Oh, believe me,
everybody's an expert on it.

12:19.227 --> 12:21.662
Sylvia's father was
suddenly Clarence Darrow.

12:21.663 --> 12:25.632
It's thrilling to see a plumber
interpret international law.

12:25.633 --> 12:28.167
You're one of the top
surgeons in the country.

12:29.436 --> 12:31.303
You must know somebody.

12:31.304 --> 12:33.205
I know a lot of people,
but it doesn't matter.

12:33.206 --> 12:36.008
It doesn't matter
if he goes back to school.

12:36.009 --> 12:39.044
He's 1-A. His induction
could be tomorrow.

12:39.045 --> 12:41.280
He's on a damn list
for the rest of his life.

12:43.850 --> 12:47.519
On some level you have
to admire his idealism.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.987
You sound like Sylvia.

12:48.988 --> 12:51.890
But she doesn't really
buy his bullshit.

12:51.891 --> 12:53.191
You think she's gonna
let her baby

12:53.192 --> 12:55.394
rot in jail for a cause?

12:56.496 --> 12:58.029
( sighs )

12:58.030 --> 12:59.930
I don't know what to do.

13:01.199 --> 13:03.367
What would you do?

13:03.368 --> 13:05.536
If it was my kid,
or if it was me?

13:05.537 --> 13:07.304
You were in the service, right?

13:07.305 --> 13:08.506
I was.

13:08.507 --> 13:10.408
You see action?

13:15.346 --> 13:17.414
It was very different.

13:17.415 --> 13:20.316
I wanted to go.

13:20.317 --> 13:22.819
And then when
I got there, well...

13:22.820 --> 13:24.921
That's the trick.

13:24.922 --> 13:27.457
Kids 18, 19 years old, they have
no sense of their own mortality.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.358
Or anyone else's.

13:29.359 --> 13:31.093
That's why they make
good soldiers.

13:31.094 --> 13:33.695
Well, the Army
paid for med school.

13:33.696 --> 13:37.032
I served in a hospital
in Pusan.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.367
We were very lucky.

13:39.368 --> 13:40.836
Lucky enough to live
in this country.

13:40.837 --> 13:43.639
And service is part
of that bargain.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.841
Sacrifice.

13:45.842 --> 13:48.476
( sighs ) We knew that.

13:48.477 --> 13:50.711
The war is wrong.

13:52.481 --> 13:53.915
I'll tell you right now, if
anyone was ever gonna get it,

13:53.916 --> 13:55.883
it's gonna be him.

13:55.884 --> 13:58.453
He's soft.

13:58.454 --> 14:00.521
I'm sure he's a good kid.

14:01.490 --> 14:04.591
The best.

14:04.592 --> 14:07.093
( sighs )

14:11.365 --> 14:13.633
<i>( TV playing )</i>

14:16.737 --> 14:18.438
What you watching?

14:18.439 --> 14:20.573
I don't know.

14:22.008 --> 14:25.578
What's the matter?
I called.

14:25.579 --> 14:26.846
<i>( TV off )</i>

14:26.847 --> 14:28.413
I didn't want to get into it
when you're about to fly,

14:28.414 --> 14:30.148
but you were supposed
to have dinner with us.

14:30.149 --> 14:32.217
I made a mistake.
We'll do it tomorrow.

14:32.218 --> 14:34.252
You don't have to make
a federal case out of it.

14:34.253 --> 14:35.753
Why don't you get a legal pad

14:35.754 --> 14:38.022
and write down a bunch of
excuses for the next week?

14:38.023 --> 14:39.891
Because none of them
mean anything to the boys.

14:39.892 --> 14:43.695
What about food, clothing, and shelter?
Does that mean anything?

14:43.696 --> 14:45.997
Remember what the minister
said at Frank's funeral?

14:45.998 --> 14:48.666
"God can turn off
the lights at any moment."

14:48.667 --> 14:51.768
You know where you're gonna be?
The office.

14:51.769 --> 14:53.136
This is temporary.

14:53.137 --> 14:55.539
I just have
to do this until--

14:55.540 --> 14:56.907
Until what?

14:56.908 --> 14:59.810
Until you are back

14:59.811 --> 15:01.512
where you were at the old firm?

15:01.513 --> 15:03.814
Because things weren't
so great then either.

15:05.383 --> 15:06.884
So we've moved on

15:06.885 --> 15:08.684
from I'm working too much
to something else.

15:08.685 --> 15:11.086
The problem is even
when you do come home,

15:11.087 --> 15:13.523
you're not here.
You're obsessed.

15:13.524 --> 15:16.959
And I can feel how
disappointing this all is

15:16.960 --> 15:18.394
compared to
your battles at work.

15:18.395 --> 15:19.896
I'm not enjoying that.

15:19.897 --> 15:22.097
How did we get to
the point where you think

15:22.098 --> 15:25.066
I don't want you
to enjoy things?

15:25.067 --> 15:28.637
I know you like having a young
copywriter in your airplane.

15:28.638 --> 15:30.739
Come on, Pete was there, too.

15:30.740 --> 15:32.941
I know you like
facing Don Draper

15:32.942 --> 15:35.109
every morning
more than the clients.

15:35.945 --> 15:38.547
( sighs )

15:39.648 --> 15:43.250
How was your day?

15:43.251 --> 15:46.520
I just wish you liked
being here more.

15:53.528 --> 15:54.961
Could you get
Mr. Campbell?

15:54.962 --> 15:56.696
Do you want to see him
before the status meeting?

15:56.697 --> 15:59.132
- Ugh, when's that?
- Now.

15:59.133 --> 16:01.201
And I also need to know if you're
attending the Chevrolet dinner.

16:01.202 --> 16:04.103
- When's that?
- Tonight.

16:04.104 --> 16:06.505
- Morning.
- May I speak with you?

16:14.881 --> 16:16.682
Does your friend still work
at the Department of Defense?

16:16.683 --> 16:18.516
No, he left for Union Carbide.

16:18.517 --> 16:20.751
But he probably still
has pull over there.

16:20.752 --> 16:22.954
What happened now?

16:25.291 --> 16:28.726
You must know plenty of people
with kids getting deferments.

16:28.727 --> 16:30.061
How are they doing that?

16:30.062 --> 16:31.596
They go to college.

16:31.597 --> 16:33.431
Divinity school.
Medical baloney.

16:33.432 --> 16:36.166
No, it's too late for that. I need
someone who can really pull strings.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.035
Well, aren't you having
dinner with General Motors,

16:38.036 --> 16:41.072
one of the largest defense
contractors in the world?

16:41.073 --> 16:42.873
What are the politics of that?

16:42.874 --> 16:45.275
I don't know, Don.
I'm not on Chevy.

16:46.612 --> 16:48.212
<i>Shall we?</i>

16:48.213 --> 16:50.147
That's not my fault.

16:51.649 --> 16:53.683
Don't worry.
If I had Chevy

16:53.684 --> 16:56.920
I wouldn't be able to devote my
full attention to Ocean Spray.

16:56.921 --> 17:00.123
- Don: Cranberries?
- Cranberry cocktail.

17:00.124 --> 17:02.358
And they like us so much they
might even give us the blends.

17:02.359 --> 17:04.761
- What about Sunkist?
- What about it?

17:04.762 --> 17:07.561
It's orange juice.

17:07.563 --> 17:08.830
Morning, everyone.

17:08.832 --> 17:11.233
- Did you know about Sunkist?
- What about it?

17:11.233 --> 17:13.669
Don told Harry to put together
a media plan right away.

17:13.670 --> 17:15.604
Why didn't you
tell us about that?

17:15.605 --> 17:18.140
Isn't this the meeting
where I tell you?

17:18.141 --> 17:19.775
Are we having this meeting?

17:19.776 --> 17:21.609
Why didn't you tell us you were
presenting to Ocean Spray?

17:21.611 --> 17:23.077
There's been a series of memos.

17:23.078 --> 17:25.079
Didn't you wonder
where everybody was?

17:25.079 --> 17:28.281
- We can't present to both.
- Which one is bigger?

17:28.282 --> 17:30.752
They're about the same.
Three million.

17:30.753 --> 17:33.220
We've already spent
$5,000 on Ocean Spray.

17:33.221 --> 17:34.789
What about our trip
to California?

17:34.790 --> 17:36.590
Was it $5,000?

17:36.591 --> 17:39.359
I have a lot of receipts.
I haven't figured it out yet.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.929
Why don't you join this company
and read a memo once in a while?

17:48.036 --> 17:49.770
( huffs )

17:49.771 --> 17:51.038
Maybe they're not a conflict.

17:51.039 --> 17:53.306
We don't have either yet.

17:53.307 --> 17:55.441
I really didn't know.

18:02.383 --> 18:04.517
I warned you
about the memos, Ted.

18:04.518 --> 18:07.053
The more you send,
the less they get read.

18:07.054 --> 18:10.823
Imagine if every time Ginger
Rogers jumped in the air,

18:10.824 --> 18:13.992
Fred Astaire punched her
in the face.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.027
Why are you taking
this to heart?

18:16.028 --> 18:19.431
Because it's directed at me.
Can you not see that?

18:19.432 --> 18:22.501
So what? You know we'll end
up with just one juice.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.571
I don't want his juice.
I want my juice.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.639
It's all your juice.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.507
Tell <i>him</i> that.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.781
<i>( door opens )</i>

18:36.782 --> 18:38.282
Michigan's in the Big 10.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.819
Ron Kutchinski just ran the
fastest half mile in the world.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.653
He's going to the Olympics.

18:42.654 --> 18:44.254
You're selling yourself short.

18:44.255 --> 18:46.223
I'm telling you, they would
be lucky to have you.

18:46.224 --> 18:47.925
I got it.

18:52.797 --> 18:55.532
Look at this. Got a couple
of high fashion models.

18:55.533 --> 18:57.234
Aren't you a gentleman?

18:57.235 --> 18:59.536
- Hey.
- Hello.

18:59.537 --> 19:01.237
Youse two don't know
each other.

19:01.238 --> 19:02.839
These are my two
favorite people.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.941
Mitchell Rosen, 16A,
I'd like you to meet

19:04.942 --> 19:09.645
Sally Draper, 17B
and all points north.

19:09.646 --> 19:13.382
I'm Julie.
I'm crashing at Sally's.

19:13.383 --> 19:15.084
Cool.

19:15.085 --> 19:18.120
They were supposed to leave a key for me.
I lost mine.

19:18.121 --> 19:20.956
Nobody said nothing to me,
but that don't mean nothing.

19:20.957 --> 19:23.225
We were going to go out
for dinner tonight.

19:23.226 --> 19:25.560
- What's good around here?
- His mother's cooking.

19:25.561 --> 19:29.664
Around here
it's just old people.

19:29.665 --> 19:31.266
Are you a musician?

19:31.267 --> 19:33.367
'Cause you look like one.

19:33.368 --> 19:35.402
Who?

19:35.403 --> 19:38.572
I don't see it.
I'll let you in.

19:38.573 --> 19:40.074
Oh, good day to you,
Mrs. Rosen.

19:40.075 --> 19:41.909
Hello. Mitchell,
did you get a cab?

19:41.910 --> 19:44.411
- I was waiting for you.
- You're unbelievable.

19:44.412 --> 19:46.580
I got it, Mrs. Rosen.
Do you know Sally and...?

19:46.581 --> 19:49.783
- I'm Julie. - I'm sorry, girls,
we're in a bit of a rush.

19:49.784 --> 19:52.118
I'll get you a cab
lickety-split.

19:52.119 --> 19:54.287
Bring them right back.

19:58.425 --> 20:00.160
You're living
with Mark Lindsay.

20:00.161 --> 20:01.470
I don't live here.

20:05.518 --> 20:07.419
What are you doing here?

20:07.420 --> 20:09.288
I said I'd meet you
at La Grenouille.

20:09.289 --> 20:12.258
Dorothy, you must let me
manage your calendar.

20:12.259 --> 20:14.092
I'm not standing
in the hallway.

20:14.093 --> 20:15.861
Come in.

20:18.732 --> 20:21.566
You get ready, Mr. Campbell.
I'll entertain her.

20:23.302 --> 20:26.404
Actually, Manolo, I'd like my
mother to myself this evening.

20:26.405 --> 20:29.474
Very well.
Good night, my sweet.

20:32.778 --> 20:34.011
Must he?

20:34.012 --> 20:36.247
He has other plans, Mother.

20:36.248 --> 20:39.816
Yes, Dorothy. I'll be
there when you wake.

20:48.626 --> 20:51.127
- Can I fix you something?
- No.

20:51.128 --> 20:53.362
Manolo doesn't
like me to drink.

20:53.363 --> 20:54.997
He likes me sharp.

20:58.568 --> 21:01.236
It's so nice the way
he looks after you.

21:01.237 --> 21:04.740
Oh, Peter, he's a gift to me.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.809
I just wanted to make
sure you're aware

21:06.810 --> 21:09.344
he's your nurse.

21:09.345 --> 21:11.112
You are prone to moments
of confusion.

21:11.113 --> 21:14.248
I suppose there's a way
I could mistake

21:14.249 --> 21:17.218
your tone for concern.

21:17.219 --> 21:19.987
I am concerned
that you have--

21:19.988 --> 21:23.157
how do I put this?

21:23.158 --> 21:26.327
--misconstrued Manolo's
attention for affection.

21:26.328 --> 21:29.130
If we're going to have
an adult conversation,

21:29.131 --> 21:31.699
let's have
an adult conversation.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.533
Has he taken advantage of you?

21:33.534 --> 21:35.735
Manny has awakened a part of me

21:35.736 --> 21:38.571
that was long dormant.

21:38.572 --> 21:42.542
Don't you think I'm entitled
to the pleasures of love?

21:42.543 --> 21:44.044
Do not be more specific.

21:44.045 --> 21:46.713
Since when is it
any of your business

21:46.714 --> 21:48.314
what goes on in my bedroom?

21:48.315 --> 21:50.816
I am afraid that we are going
to have to let him go.

21:50.817 --> 21:53.618
Oh, no.
What did he do?

21:53.619 --> 21:55.654
He's a pervert.

21:58.358 --> 22:00.592
You were a sour little boy.

22:00.593 --> 22:03.528
And you're a sour little man.

22:03.529 --> 22:06.832
How could I expect you
to be understanding?

22:06.833 --> 22:09.601
You've always been unlovable.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.805
Now I've lost my appetite.

22:13.806 --> 22:14.840
I'm leaving.

22:14.841 --> 22:16.875
You'll never find
your way home.

22:16.876 --> 22:19.043
I have carfare

22:19.044 --> 22:21.479
and a piece of paper
with my address

22:21.480 --> 22:24.715
written in his
elegant handwriting.

22:26.451 --> 22:28.753
Mother.

22:36.761 --> 22:38.595
- <i>( door closes )</i>
<i>- ( men laughing )</i>

22:38.596 --> 22:40.263
Cheesecake?
Chocolate cake?

22:40.264 --> 22:42.432
- Two of everything.
- And another round.

22:42.433 --> 22:45.635
- Why not?
- Oh, I can never get enough of it.

22:45.636 --> 22:47.970
Growing up in Cleveland, my dad
would take me right on Lake Erie.

22:47.971 --> 22:49.839
But, eh, water's gone bad now.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.173
You should go to Florida.

22:51.174 --> 22:53.341
Saltwater.
Down off the Keys

22:53.342 --> 22:55.677
- where the marlin run.
- Write your own Hemmingway story.

22:55.678 --> 22:57.479
And if you don't catch anything,
you have to blow your brains out.

22:57.480 --> 23:00.248
( laughing )

23:00.249 --> 23:02.785
So, Ross, where do you
take your kid fishing?

23:02.786 --> 23:05.921
I just got the two girls, and they
could never keep their mouths shut.

23:05.922 --> 23:07.423
But my grandson's just like me.

23:07.424 --> 23:10.024
Last summer we went
up to Muskoka.

23:10.025 --> 23:11.559
Ontario.

23:11.560 --> 23:12.359
Jesus, now we got to hear
about this kid again.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.895
( men laugh )

23:13.896 --> 23:15.530
Brendan's at Antioch.

23:15.531 --> 23:17.665
Yup, studying the classics.

23:19.100 --> 23:21.201
But I hope he'll come
to his senses.

23:21.202 --> 23:23.003
( laughs )

23:23.004 --> 23:25.539
He's got a couple of years
before he has decisions to make.

23:25.540 --> 23:28.608
Well, as long as we're working
together, he's got a job with us.

23:28.609 --> 23:30.410
( laughing )

23:31.712 --> 23:33.947
Friend of mine's kid
just got to that point.

23:33.948 --> 23:36.683
He doesn't have a lot of choices left.
1-A. Can you imagine?

23:40.921 --> 23:42.855
Well, my heart goes out to him.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.289
That's just one of those
problems that can't be solved.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.860
I've got two sons.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.361
Thank God they're too young.

23:49.362 --> 23:51.931
I don't even like
to think about that.

23:51.932 --> 23:53.365
I know.

23:53.366 --> 23:56.034
My friend is just
beside himself.

23:57.670 --> 24:00.505
I mean, people are
doing things, though.

24:00.506 --> 24:02.607
Believe me, we know about that.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.476
Makes me sick.

24:11.484 --> 24:14.585
Well, next year this time,
we'll have won the war.

24:14.586 --> 24:16.820
We'll take Brendan to
dinner, get him plastered,

24:16.821 --> 24:18.522
and have him read
the menu in Latin.

24:20.825 --> 24:22.893
Ted, are you an angler?

24:22.894 --> 24:25.161
My hobby is coming up
with names for the XP.

24:25.162 --> 24:27.163
( all laugh )

24:34.068 --> 24:37.134
_

24:37.240 --> 24:39.008
Last one.

24:47.049 --> 24:49.417
Okay.

24:49.418 --> 24:51.753
"Things I like
about Mitchell."

24:56.091 --> 24:57.692
"His ass"?

24:57.693 --> 24:59.895
- Shh.
- When did you see that?

24:59.896 --> 25:02.262
I couldn't think
of anything else.

25:02.263 --> 25:04.331
What did you put?

25:05.834 --> 25:08.502
"How he smiled at me."

25:08.503 --> 25:10.337
"His shoulders."

25:12.040 --> 25:13.541
"His red shirt."

25:13.542 --> 25:16.443
- ( giggles )
- ( knock on door )

25:16.444 --> 25:18.578
You girls have
a big day tomorrow

25:18.579 --> 25:21.714
and I can tell you right now, the next
time this door opens, it won't be me.

25:21.715 --> 25:25.084
- Lights out.
- Good night, Mrs. Draper.

25:28.155 --> 25:30.256
Why do you keep
calling her that?

25:30.257 --> 25:32.758
'Cause she hates it.

25:32.759 --> 25:34.259
Think about it.

25:34.260 --> 25:36.895
He's right down there.

25:39.331 --> 25:41.199
You should sneak down
and kiss him.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.368
He talked to you.

25:45.939 --> 25:48.239
God, I wish I lived here.

25:53.211 --> 25:55.179
<i>( tires squealing )</i>

25:58.349 --> 26:01.786
<i>( faint pattering )</i>

26:07.558 --> 26:08.959
<i>( rattling )</i>

26:08.960 --> 26:11.661
<i>( squeaking )</i>

26:13.064 --> 26:16.499
( ringing )

26:19.369 --> 26:21.737
- Yeah?
- Did I wake you?

26:21.738 --> 26:24.673
- Yeah.
- There's a rat in my apartment.

26:26.442 --> 26:27.910
Told you to get traps.

26:27.911 --> 26:30.079
It's in the trap
and it's mortally wounded.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.114
I'm pretty sure
'cause there's a lot of blood.

26:32.115 --> 26:33.682
Did you call an ambulance?

26:33.683 --> 26:36.051
You have to come over.
It went under the couch.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.019
I can't even look.
What if it's still alive?

26:38.020 --> 26:40.955
What if I lift the couch
and it starts flipping around?

26:40.956 --> 26:44.058
I'm not your boyfriend.

26:46.394 --> 26:48.630
Maybe I'll make it worth
your while if you come over.

26:48.631 --> 26:51.432
No, you won't.
Now good night.

26:51.433 --> 26:53.133
You're not interested?

26:53.134 --> 26:54.868
No.

26:54.869 --> 26:56.737
Then why are you using
your sexy voice?

26:56.738 --> 26:58.204
( chuckles )

26:58.205 --> 27:00.107
Tuesday morning's great.

27:00.108 --> 27:01.541
For what?

27:01.542 --> 27:03.977
Oh.

27:03.978 --> 27:05.345
Why didn't you say so?

27:05.346 --> 27:08.048
You can bring her.

27:08.049 --> 27:10.349
It'll be dead by morning.

27:21.152 --> 27:23.353
Eleanor Roosevelt.

27:23.354 --> 27:26.289
I can't remember anything
'cause I didn't sleep.

27:26.290 --> 27:28.124
Your floor smells like pee.

27:28.125 --> 27:30.760
- No, it doesn't.
- Do I smell like pee?

27:30.761 --> 27:32.294
You smell like Prell.

27:32.295 --> 27:33.863
Sally, you're not ready?

27:33.864 --> 27:35.564
I let the guest shower first.

27:35.565 --> 27:37.533
Well, I have to go to work.

27:37.534 --> 27:39.669
But first I have to put you
two in a cab, so shake a leg.

27:39.670 --> 27:41.537
Oh, take out the trash.

27:41.538 --> 27:43.438
I have to get ready.

27:44.606 --> 27:46.507
I'll do it, Mrs. Draper.

27:46.508 --> 27:48.242
It's Megan.

27:48.243 --> 27:50.812
I would love to visit
the studio sometime.

27:50.813 --> 27:53.048
Well, hopefully
I'll still have a job.

27:53.049 --> 27:54.983
I have to make a phone call.

27:54.984 --> 27:57.585
- Your agent?
- Yes, actually.

28:09.197 --> 28:10.898
Could you get me some coffee?

28:16.003 --> 28:18.370
What the hell were you
up to last night?

28:18.371 --> 28:20.239
- <i>( intercom buzzes )</i>
<i>- Dawn: Mr. Draper.</i>

28:20.240 --> 28:23.142
I'm fine, Dawn.
You want some coffee?

28:23.143 --> 28:24.944
What the hell
were you thinking?

28:24.945 --> 28:28.114
You said you weren't going to be
involved in Chevy until 1970.

28:28.115 --> 28:30.016
So stay the hell out of it.

28:30.017 --> 28:31.817
Stop trying to poison
my relationship.

28:31.818 --> 28:34.052
Last time I checked,
it's <i>our</i> relationship.

28:34.053 --> 28:35.887
And not everything
is about you, Ted.

28:35.888 --> 28:37.756
Then be better at it.

28:37.757 --> 28:39.991
- What are you talking about?
- You know this.

28:39.992 --> 28:43.461
A client shouldn't have a single
negative feeling in your presence.

28:43.462 --> 28:45.731
Not the food, not the wine,

28:45.732 --> 28:47.765
and certainly not the war.

28:47.766 --> 28:48.933
I was just taking
their temperature.

28:48.934 --> 28:51.168
Why would you do that?

28:51.169 --> 28:52.703
It's Chevy, Don.

28:52.704 --> 28:55.672
- You'd do it for your kid.
- But it's not your kid.

28:55.673 --> 28:58.008
Oh, is it your kid?

28:58.009 --> 29:00.344
No, it's my friend's kid.

29:08.753 --> 29:10.386
Well, I bet you don't have
a lot of friends, Don,

29:10.387 --> 29:12.288
so I'm going to assume
this is important.

29:12.289 --> 29:14.124
It is.

29:16.026 --> 29:19.095
I just--
I don't know what to do.

29:19.096 --> 29:21.096
Do you know how young 19 is?

29:21.097 --> 29:22.998
Did you ever think
about talking to me

29:22.999 --> 29:24.432
instead of our most
important client?

29:24.433 --> 29:26.101
I don't know.
It's GM.

29:26.102 --> 29:28.804
Who else has that kind
of clout in Washington?

29:28.805 --> 29:30.505
Does he wear glasses?

29:30.506 --> 29:32.841
I don't think so, but he could.

29:35.211 --> 29:37.578
The guy who taught me to fly

29:37.579 --> 29:40.581
is a brigadier general
in the Air National Guard.

29:40.582 --> 29:42.483
They're always looking
for exceptional young men

29:42.484 --> 29:44.819
to become pilots.

29:46.488 --> 29:48.555
And you'd be willing
to call him?

29:48.556 --> 29:50.758
I'd consider it.

29:50.759 --> 29:53.660
But first, you're going
to have to stop the war.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.428
I can't stop the war, Ted.

29:55.429 --> 29:56.763
Don't be an asshole, Don.

29:56.764 --> 29:58.464
The war you're waging on me.

29:58.465 --> 30:00.133
You have to lower your weapons.

30:00.134 --> 30:01.902
What are you talking about?

30:01.903 --> 30:04.805
I'm talking about how we
are going to get Ocean Spray.

30:04.806 --> 30:07.640
So you need to stop
chasing Sunkist.

30:07.641 --> 30:10.242
You're not going to compete
with me like that anymore.

30:10.243 --> 30:12.477
We're on the same damn side.

30:12.478 --> 30:16.248
- That's it?
- Don't act like it's nothing.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.483
It seems to be
impossible so far.

30:21.054 --> 30:23.755
You'd really do that?

30:33.065 --> 30:34.432
Thank you.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.000
This is not
a handshake of gratitude.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.569
- This is a binding contract.
- Of course.

30:38.570 --> 30:41.771
- Whatever you want.
- That's what I want.

30:44.342 --> 30:47.044
Hold on.
What's the next step?

30:47.045 --> 30:49.279
( sighs ) Tell the kid
to write a letter

30:49.280 --> 30:51.681
about his childhood
dream of being a pilot.

30:51.682 --> 30:54.084
And it better be convincing.
You should write it.

30:54.085 --> 30:56.785
And tell him to get a haircut.

30:56.786 --> 31:00.857
Be straight, Ted.
What are the chances?

31:00.858 --> 31:02.825
I'm going to call right now.

31:02.826 --> 31:04.526
Thank you.

31:10.033 --> 31:12.334
Can you get Dr. Rosen
on the phone?

31:14.803 --> 31:16.771
( phone ringing )

31:19.909 --> 31:23.378
- Rosen residence.
- It's me. It's Don.

31:23.379 --> 31:24.913
What do you want?

31:24.914 --> 31:26.748
I'm trying to reach Arnold.

31:26.749 --> 31:29.449
<i>The office said</i>
<i>he was home sick.</i>

31:29.450 --> 31:31.285
It's about Mitchell.

31:31.286 --> 31:33.053
What? Tell me.

31:33.054 --> 31:35.923
I know someone who knows someone
in the Air National Guard.

31:35.924 --> 31:38.359
He's getting him a spot.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.160
You told someone?

31:40.161 --> 31:41.661
It's my partner.

31:41.662 --> 31:43.864
He's doing me a favor.

31:48.735 --> 31:51.670
Did you fix it?

31:51.671 --> 31:53.172
He just wants Mitchell
to cut his hair

31:53.173 --> 31:55.808
and sign a letter.

31:55.809 --> 31:58.311
And the two of you need to
make sure he follows through.

31:58.312 --> 32:00.178
Oh, he'll follow through.

32:01.747 --> 32:03.448
I bet.

32:03.449 --> 32:05.918
( exhales )

32:08.121 --> 32:10.255
My God, is it possible?

32:10.256 --> 32:12.991
I think so,
but we have to act fast.

32:12.992 --> 32:16.161
They went upstate to the VA
to call on an army buddy.

32:16.162 --> 32:18.596
I'll send them up tonight.

32:18.597 --> 32:20.698
Sylvia, sweetheart,
it's gonna be okay.

32:23.736 --> 32:27.739
<i>( sniffling, sobbing )</i>

32:29.241 --> 32:32.243
Are you there?

32:32.244 --> 32:34.110
Yes.

32:34.111 --> 32:36.647
Please, stop crying.

32:36.648 --> 32:38.982
( sighs ) I feel better,

32:38.983 --> 32:41.284
but I'll feel better
when I know it's done.

32:45.890 --> 32:47.991
Don...

32:47.992 --> 32:50.092
Yes?

32:51.595 --> 32:53.629
I can't believe you
would do this for me.

32:53.630 --> 32:56.466
You know I have children, too.

32:56.467 --> 32:59.435
I know that's not
why you're doing it.

33:01.872 --> 33:04.739
And I hope--

33:04.740 --> 33:07.943
well, I hope you know that I
was just frustrated with you.

33:10.813 --> 33:12.981
I do now.

33:15.117 --> 33:18.453
I didn't want you
to fall in love.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.855
You didn't feel anything?

33:27.095 --> 33:29.329
No, I just...

33:31.867 --> 33:34.267
I don't want
to go through this again.

33:37.237 --> 33:39.639
You were good to me.

33:41.475 --> 33:44.176
Better than I was to you.

33:51.218 --> 33:53.584
- Are we going to lunch, because--
- Get in here and close the door.

33:56.255 --> 33:58.123
You have given me
a terrible problem

33:58.124 --> 33:59.390
and now you're going to fix it.

33:59.391 --> 34:01.893
Is this about Sunkist?
Because I did some digging--

34:01.894 --> 34:05.230
I told you we needed a nurse
and you sent us a rapist.

34:05.231 --> 34:06.564
Manolo?

34:06.565 --> 34:08.065
In fact, I never
told you anything.

34:08.067 --> 34:09.666
You were just
"doing some digging."

34:09.667 --> 34:12.069
Calm down.
Sit down.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.241
Bob...

34:17.242 --> 34:19.909
she has the mind of a child.

34:19.911 --> 34:21.777
That man took advantage of her.

34:21.779 --> 34:25.081
I assume she told
you this story.

34:25.081 --> 34:27.150
Don't you have
your answer right there?

34:27.150 --> 34:28.885
She says they're in love

34:28.886 --> 34:31.321
and it's the first time in months
she's seemed sure of anything.

34:31.322 --> 34:35.623
I don't think that Manolo's
interests turn that way.

34:35.625 --> 34:38.061
Great, so he's a degenerate.

34:38.062 --> 34:40.196
That means he's capable
of anything.

34:44.234 --> 34:47.168
What exactly did she say?

34:47.170 --> 34:49.905
Please, I'm just
trying to forget it.

34:49.906 --> 34:52.007
Drink that.

34:56.812 --> 34:58.346
( exhales )

34:58.347 --> 35:02.950
- Feel better now?
- I do.

35:02.951 --> 35:04.518
Can I ask you something?

35:05.553 --> 35:07.454
Did she seem happy?

35:08.323 --> 35:10.624
Yes.

35:10.625 --> 35:12.459
She did.

35:15.930 --> 35:18.965
( sighs )

35:18.966 --> 35:21.968
Is it really
so impossible to imagine?

35:21.969 --> 35:25.105
What?

35:25.106 --> 35:26.739
Couldn't it be that

35:26.740 --> 35:30.142
if someone took care of you,

35:30.143 --> 35:32.711
very good care of you...

35:34.414 --> 35:37.283
if this person would do
anything for you,

35:37.284 --> 35:41.020
if your well-being
was his only thought...

35:43.256 --> 35:45.456
is it impossible that you might

35:45.457 --> 35:48.092
begin to feel something
for him?

35:50.495 --> 35:53.664
When there's true love,

35:53.665 --> 35:56.234
it doesn't matter who it is.

36:12.817 --> 36:15.618
Tell him I'll give him
a month's pay.

36:15.619 --> 36:18.787
And tell him it's disgusting.

36:22.892 --> 36:25.061
Of course.

36:33.702 --> 36:35.503
<i>( door closes )</i>

36:35.504 --> 36:37.839
The capital of the
Philippines is Manila.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.808
Its president
is Ferdinand Marcos.

36:40.809 --> 36:43.044
Its national language
is Tagalog,

36:43.045 --> 36:45.646
but many of its
inhabitants speak Spanish

36:45.647 --> 36:47.715
due to its colonial past.

36:47.716 --> 36:50.684
And their national
product is...?

36:50.685 --> 36:53.954
I don't know.
Manila envelopes?

36:53.955 --> 36:57.357
- You don't know anything.
- So?

36:57.358 --> 36:59.593
How about this? All the boys are
going to think you're dumb.

36:59.594 --> 37:01.628
Don't tell me how to get boys.

37:01.629 --> 37:03.697
You went to second base twice.

37:03.698 --> 37:06.666
That's a lot more than you.

37:06.667 --> 37:08.869
So if I were you,
I'd be scared.

37:08.870 --> 37:11.471
- Of what?
- Of what you're going to do

37:11.472 --> 37:13.572
when Mitchell asks you
to go all the way.

37:13.573 --> 37:15.541
He doesn't even know I'm alive.

37:15.542 --> 37:18.677
Oh, I took care of that.

37:18.678 --> 37:20.412
What did you do?

37:20.413 --> 37:21.914
I introduced you.

37:21.915 --> 37:23.549
I introduced myself.

37:23.550 --> 37:27.119
No, I took the letter
and I signed your name.

37:27.120 --> 37:30.087
- What?!
- And I slid it under the back door.

37:30.088 --> 37:32.690
Ow! That really hurts.

37:32.691 --> 37:34.592
How could you do that?
Now I can never go back.

37:34.593 --> 37:36.661
You know you're going
to thank me.

37:36.662 --> 37:37.562
( sighs )

37:43.923 --> 37:45.122
Just because your shift is over

37:45.123 --> 37:47.058
doesn't mean you can get
undressed in the lobby.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.087
- Incredible.
- What?

37:54.088 --> 37:56.957
He should greet you.
How you doing today?

37:56.958 --> 38:00.994
I'm-- I got--
I left something.

38:00.995 --> 38:02.730
And I don't have my key.

38:02.731 --> 38:04.865
You mean you lost it already?

38:04.866 --> 38:07.066
Can I have the keys, please?

38:09.903 --> 38:12.304
Yeah. Okay.

38:13.907 --> 38:15.675
- <i>( elevator bell rings )</i>
<i>- Go fast.</i>

38:19.513 --> 38:20.980
Oh, what have we got here?

38:20.981 --> 38:22.848
<i>Couple of high fashion models?</i>

38:36.996 --> 38:39.330
( knocks lightly )

38:55.413 --> 38:57.447
Sylvia:
Oh, God.

39:00.584 --> 39:02.786
( keys clatter )

39:05.123 --> 39:07.624
- Sally.
- Oh, God.

39:09.260 --> 39:10.760
Oh, dear God.

39:10.761 --> 39:12.829
( panting )

39:12.830 --> 39:15.264
Dear God, what have we done?

39:15.265 --> 39:17.834
( panting )

39:22.440 --> 39:24.707
Sally!

39:28.912 --> 39:31.413
Sally!

39:31.414 --> 39:33.381
Sally!

39:57.172 --> 39:59.006
<i>( elevator bell rings )</i>

40:01.041 --> 40:02.442
Did Sally just come
through here?

40:02.443 --> 40:04.210
Mr. Draper, I didn't
know you was home.

40:04.211 --> 40:05.879
She hopped in a cab just now.
I'll go get her.

40:08.583 --> 40:10.951
You okay?

40:10.952 --> 40:12.519
Yes.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.554
Did something happen?

40:14.555 --> 40:17.490
I know she lost her keys. I gave
her the keys. It's my fault.

40:31.904 --> 40:33.972
Mr. Draper?

41:07.004 --> 41:08.838
( sighs )

41:12.009 --> 41:14.744
<i>( TV playing )</i>

41:27.957 --> 41:32.260
<i>( TV playing same show )</i>

42:16.469 --> 42:18.536
Megan:
<i>Hello?</i>

42:31.683 --> 42:33.985
Oh, I'm glad you're home.

42:36.688 --> 42:39.520
Let me get you a plate.

42:39.521 --> 42:41.355
Oh, wow.

42:41.356 --> 42:43.290
I had a client...

42:43.291 --> 42:45.292
meeting-- lunch.

42:45.293 --> 42:47.661
- Sit down.
- I'm--

42:47.662 --> 42:49.530
I'm gonna lay down.

42:49.531 --> 42:51.799
You need to get some food in you.
Sit down.

42:53.802 --> 42:56.268
Do you want me
to cut you a piece?

42:58.806 --> 43:01.007
- No.
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>

43:01.008 --> 43:02.774
I got it.

43:05.412 --> 43:07.513
- <i>( door opens )</i>
<i>- Megan: Hello.</i>

43:07.514 --> 43:09.648
Arnold:
I'm sorry to bother you.

43:09.649 --> 43:11.984
Megan: Don, Arnold and
Mitchell <i>are here.</i>

43:11.985 --> 43:13.585
<i>( door closes )</i>

43:13.586 --> 43:15.488
- I don't feel well.
- Stop.

43:19.258 --> 43:20.791
Hello, Mitchell.

43:20.792 --> 43:22.660
I'm sorry
to interrupt your dinner,

43:22.661 --> 43:24.962
but we just got back and Mitchell
has something he wants to say.

43:28.634 --> 43:30.768
Mr. Draper...

43:33.172 --> 43:35.806
thank you very much.

43:36.942 --> 43:38.709
We'll see if it works.

43:38.710 --> 43:41.211
- What?
- He didn't tell you?

43:42.614 --> 43:44.749
Don talked to somebody for us.

43:44.750 --> 43:46.083
Really?

43:46.084 --> 43:48.653
Sylvia sends her gratitude.
She is overwhelmed.

43:50.721 --> 43:53.356
Do you want something to eat?
We should celebrate.

43:53.357 --> 43:55.391
One step at a time.

43:55.392 --> 43:58.595
Anyway, Don,

43:58.596 --> 44:00.430
I owe you.

44:03.333 --> 44:06.102
Let's go.

44:06.103 --> 44:07.703
Arnold: No, you eat. I got it.

44:11.507 --> 44:13.709
You are the sweetest man.

44:15.511 --> 44:17.446
You make me sick!

44:18.648 --> 44:20.916
Sally, come back here!

44:20.917 --> 44:23.017
What happened?

44:23.018 --> 44:24.786
I don't know.

44:24.787 --> 44:25.987
I'm gonna go talk to her.

44:25.988 --> 44:27.622
No.
I'll talk to her.

44:30.626 --> 44:32.961
She has a crush on Mitchell.

44:32.962 --> 44:35.229
Oh.

44:40.668 --> 44:42.636
Sally.

44:46.475 --> 44:48.409
- Open the door.
- <i>No.</i>

44:48.410 --> 44:50.544
You don't get
to talk to me anymore.

44:52.380 --> 44:54.815
Sally?

44:56.750 --> 45:00.120
Sally, open the door.
I need to talk to you.

45:20.806 --> 45:23.008
I know you think
you saw something.

45:25.778 --> 45:30.080
I was... comforting
Mrs. Rosen.

45:33.218 --> 45:35.753
She was very upset.

45:38.890 --> 45:41.225
It's very...

45:43.128 --> 45:45.762
complicated.

45:49.600 --> 45:52.101
Sally, can you hear me?

45:52.102 --> 45:54.971
Yes.

45:54.972 --> 45:57.440
Did you hear what I said?

46:00.544 --> 46:02.444
Okay.
