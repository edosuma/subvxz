- Hmm.
- Are you ok?

04:25.366 --> 04:27.366
Mm-hm.

04:33.506 --> 04:34.940
Never thought I'd
sleep with a guy

04:34.942 --> 04:36.775
who has bigger boobs than me.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.711
They're not big boobs, though.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.547
Yeah, look. Cleavage!

04:42.549 --> 04:44.783
- Shh, shh.
- Oh!

05:20.820 --> 05:22.688
Woman: Do you remember?

05:22.690 --> 05:27.659
Slow-cooked lamb
with garlic mash.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.729
Mm-hm.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.964
But those were the clincher.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.836
You slept with me for my food?

05:37.838 --> 05:40.372
Absolutely!

10:02.702 --> 10:04.903
Man: Do you wanna
take some lunch?

10:04.905 --> 10:06.938
I think there's some leftover
chops in the fridge.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.673
Boy: Sure.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.375
Man: Ok.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.378
There you go.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.289
Boy: Did you have someone
over last night?

10:20.386 --> 10:21.953
No.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.691
Alright, I need you
to do me a favour.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.693
Can you call work and tell
them I'm running late?

10:31.897 --> 10:33.632
See you later, ok?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.144
Uh-oh. Sprung!

11:19.146 --> 11:22.714
Now you think I'm a scurvy dog
going through your things.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.749
Don't be silly. There's
a sign, you see?

11:24.751 --> 11:26.918
I know someone who might like
the display case, that's all.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.420
- Be my guest.
- Yeah?

11:28.422 --> 11:29.988
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.825
Can I give you a hand?

11:33.827 --> 11:36.861
Um...

11:36.863 --> 11:38.930
Yeah, my... My keys.

11:47.239 --> 11:49.841
It's the square silver one.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.209
Yep.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.881
Thanks for that.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.358
You two look great together.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.327
Could still pull it off.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.895
Man: You think?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.297
I have an imagination.

12:23.976 --> 12:27.812
No... I can't. Not right now.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.981
I'm already late for work.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.417
Another 15 minutes won't
make a difference.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.985
Tomorrow?

12:33.987 --> 12:37.756
Ok. Tomorrow.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.924
I take a break at 11:30.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.994
Um... you could have some cake.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.063
- Cake?
- Yeah.

12:45.065 --> 12:48.767
Look, um... I don't
mean to brag,

12:48.769 --> 12:53.271
but, uh... I've got some
cakey tricks of my own.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.839
- Oh!
- Yeah.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.141
Cakey tricks?

12:56.143 --> 12:58.042
Tomorrow?

12:58.044 --> 12:59.878
- Tomorrow.
- Ok.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.522
Come in!

13:46.393 --> 13:48.226
I, uh, thought you were closed.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.428
Oh, no, it just looks like it.
Come on in.

13:52.097 --> 13:54.332
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

13:54.334 --> 13:56.935
Just flowers.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.336
Ok.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.208
The lilies are pretty.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.144
Um... the roses are always safe.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.847
Is there a special occasion?

14:08.849 --> 14:10.982
Oh, no. Just for mum.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.918
Oh, you're a nice boy,
buying flowers for your mum.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.453
It's her birthday.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.522
I'm impressed you remembered!

14:17.524 --> 14:19.524
What colour do you
think she'd like?

14:21.427 --> 14:23.494
I think pink, probably.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.434
The tulips are a personal
favourite of mine.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.536
She likes tulips.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.405
They always look so pure.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.080
They're amazing.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.518
Come with me. I wanna
show you something.

14:57.997 --> 15:00.064
Come.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.533
The cymbidiums flower
every two years.

15:06.272 --> 15:07.939
You have to look closely.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.242
Your nose almost
has to touch it.

15:15.180 --> 15:16.581
See that?

15:25.991 --> 15:27.625
I wish I could take a photo.

15:30.963 --> 15:33.164
Turn around. Close your eyes.

15:37.536 --> 15:39.103
Hold out your hand.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.139
- What is it?
- Hold out.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.540
There you go.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.276
- Can I open?
- Yeah.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.348
It's yours.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.950
Really?

15:51.952 --> 15:53.451
Would you like a lesson?

15:53.453 --> 15:56.220
- Yeah.
- Ok. Very easy.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.723
All you do is point
at the subject.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.458
Ok, now, there's no zoom,

16:00.460 --> 16:02.393
so you just use
this here to focus.

16:04.129 --> 16:08.066
And click.

16:08.068 --> 16:11.035
It's a little bit of a dinosaur,
so you wind it on manually.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.071
Oh! Your lucky last.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.373
I'll just change the roll.

16:24.516 --> 16:26.117
Do you live close by?

16:26.119 --> 16:27.518
Not far.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.393
You're all set.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.742
Ok. Pens down.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.778
Let's see what you've got.

17:26.780 --> 17:29.080
Sarah.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.515
Let's share it.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.620
I fight, I pine

17:35.622 --> 17:37.321
why does the sun shine?

17:37.323 --> 17:39.791
He speaks, I drown

17:39.793 --> 17:42.427
nothing sought, nothing found

17:42.429 --> 17:44.495
obsessed with beauty
and treasure within

17:44.497 --> 17:46.397
"open sesame," said Aladdin

17:46.399 --> 17:48.166
a thousand and one tales

17:48.168 --> 17:50.501
a language divine...

17:50.503 --> 17:52.136
And that's it.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.840
Hmm.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.442
That's good.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.544
- Well done. I like that.
- Thank you.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.813
He, um... "He speaks..."

18:01.815 --> 18:04.148
- I drown.
- Man: I drown.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.683
- Sarah: Yeah.
- Man: Oh, it's nice.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.321
Um...

18:16.528 --> 18:18.096
Shelley?

18:25.337 --> 18:28.473
Withered flesh and
sagging little breasts

18:29.608 --> 18:31.642
something about an older man

18:31.644 --> 18:35.746
that makes me want to
self-combust, self-destruct...

18:37.817 --> 18:40.551
I want to know what it's like

18:40.553 --> 18:46.357
to Sully oneself
with 50-plus lust

18:46.359 --> 18:52.230
watery sperm and carefree germs

18:52.232 --> 18:57.468
running free on mr wrinklee.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.542
Thank you, shelley.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.611
Ok, people, uh, we're...
We're done for today.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.347

Keep your journaling up

19:09.349 --> 19:13.151
and for next week,
remember to bring in, um,

19:13.153 --> 19:15.553
an... an image from childhood

19:15.555 --> 19:17.421
that resonates with you.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.683
Uh...

20:00.532 --> 20:01.899
No.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.537
No.

20:10.776 --> 20:12.643
No.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.779

let me pay for this.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.449
Yes. Credit card.

20:29.761 --> 20:31.996
Oh, no.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.740
It looks good on you.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.260
I... she'll be cool.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.396
No, no, she will. She'll
be happy to get rid of me.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.598
- Is tomorrow too soon?
- No, no.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.800
I... i can come round,

21:09.802 --> 21:11.636
Oh, no, no, no.
That's too early.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.471
9:30's better. I hate mornings.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.373

- And?

22:24.110 --> 22:27.611
I didn't leave my wallet
behind by any chance?

22:32.084 --> 22:34.085
..Loading the car.

22:34.087 --> 22:36.854
No, I don't think so. But
I kind of wish you did.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.622

22:49.001 --> 22:50.801
- Huh.
- Mmm.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.078
- Your turn.
- To do what?

23:01.080 --> 23:02.813

23:04.549 --> 23:07.385

Shelley: Hello?

27:59.944 --> 28:02.680
What are you doing out here?

28:31.876 --> 28:34.011
You're gonna be ok.

28:35.146 --> 28:37.181
You think?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.218
Shelley.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.902
Shelley...

29:06.511 --> 29:08.846
I'm sorry.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.752
I'm sorry.

29:19.290 --> 29:21.191
I'm sorry.

29:29.033 --> 29:30.901
Goodnight.

31:01.059 --> 31:02.059
Come see what you think.

31:06.564 --> 31:08.532
I don't think the
antennae are that long.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.267
Really?

31:13.372 --> 31:17.174
Hmm. You're right but
only by a smidge.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.609
Told you.

31:18.611 --> 31:21.011
Do you know how much I love you?

31:22.280 --> 31:24.514
Mwah. You're a gorgeous boy.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.183
Hey?

31:37.228 --> 31:39.062
- Morning.
- Hey, you.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.271
Is that your dad's
new girlfriend?

31:48.306 --> 31:51.174
No. Oh... I don't know.

31:51.176 --> 31:52.976
She's sexy.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.314
Is he ok?

31:57.316 --> 31:59.116
Who?

31:59.118 --> 32:00.918
Your dad.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.087
Yeah, I... I guess.

32:04.089 --> 32:07.090
Yeah, I... Thanks
for doing this.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.927
Wait. I've got
something for you.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.271
Girl: Do you have any of those?

32:21.273 --> 32:23.573
No. I don't.

32:23.575 --> 32:27.511
I did some research. They
like banana and apple.

32:28.646 --> 32:30.647
Great. Thank you.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.482
No problem.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.685
- I, uh... I gotta go.
- Ok.

32:34.687 --> 32:36.720
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

33:58.403 --> 34:00.103
He's a beauty.

34:00.105 --> 34:01.538
It's a she.

34:01.540 --> 34:05.142
Your mum would've liked her.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.248
Hey, I got you a present.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.815
What is it?

34:12.818 --> 34:15.485
It's in the boot. Do you
want to give me a hand?

34:15.487 --> 34:17.254
Come on.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.429
Where'd you get it?

34:25.431 --> 34:27.531
You know the flower shop?
Yeah, there's a new owner.

34:27.533 --> 34:30.199
I met her yesterday.
She seems nice, eh?

34:32.570 --> 34:34.571
Do you want to grab that end?

34:34.572 --> 34:36.339
Yeah.

34:37.341 --> 34:39.342
Hey, what have we got here?

34:39.344 --> 34:41.143
- Whoa! Hello!
- Oh, dad...

34:41.146 --> 34:43.380
- Where'd you get these?
- Gary.

34:43.382 --> 34:46.683
Gary? Gary. I mean, they are...

34:46.685 --> 34:49.753
Look, mate, they're a great
set, there's no doubt about it,

34:49.755 --> 34:51.721
but not something I want
ending up at school.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.456
No way I want you
wanking over them.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.292
What?!

34:55.293 --> 34:56.860
Mate, that's a bit rough.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.234
Come in.

36:12.870 --> 36:14.171
Lyn!

36:14.173 --> 36:15.172
Allan.

36:15.174 --> 36:16.773
How are you?

36:17.775 --> 36:19.843
Um, yeah, I'm fine.

36:21.612 --> 36:23.380
There's been some gossip.

36:23.382 --> 36:26.316
Don't ask me how I heard it.
That's not important.

36:26.318 --> 36:30.220
What is important is that
you tell me the truth.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.621
Once I know the truth

36:31.623 --> 36:33.657
then we can do something
about it, hm?

36:35.359 --> 36:37.694
Have you been having an
affair with a student here?

36:39.564 --> 36:40.931
No.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.202
Just a moment.

36:45.204 --> 36:47.470
That's ok. We're finished here.

36:49.974 --> 36:51.775
Go on with your meeting.

37:00.618 --> 37:03.420
Oh! Yummy!

37:03.422 --> 37:05.622
Stop. Don't... don't touch that.

37:10.861 --> 37:12.662
She looked scary.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.397
Are you in trouble?

37:14.399 --> 37:17.000
No.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.802
Well...

37:18.804 --> 37:23.240
..I can tell that you have
been a very naughty boy,

37:23.242 --> 37:26.776
and I want you to come with
me before they shoot you!

37:26.778 --> 37:28.678
What are those?

37:28.680 --> 37:31.915
These, my dear friend,

37:31.917 --> 37:34.417
are cock-o-rings.

37:35.753 --> 37:38.788
Go, show me your 'o' mouth.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.624
Oh!

37:42.460 --> 37:44.427
Oh! Oh!

37:45.429 --> 37:47.597
Ohhhh!

37:50.334 --> 37:52.035
You can't be serious.

37:53.537 --> 37:55.538
I am serious, it
literally took me,

37:55.540 --> 37:57.674
like, hours to come
up with these.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.276
Shelley...

38:00.044 --> 38:01.845
I can't be doing this.

38:03.514 --> 38:05.348
When are you gonna lighten up?

38:05.350 --> 38:06.950
It's ok.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.752
You're scared.

38:08.754 --> 38:11.021
Scared that I'd dob you in,

38:11.023 --> 38:12.989
scared you'd lose your job

38:12.991 --> 38:15.292
and there'd be a public outcry.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.861
I get it.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.796
Don't worry.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.998
But I promise

38:22.000 --> 38:24.567
that is never gonna happen.

38:26.637 --> 38:28.838
Look, I won't even touch you.

38:30.641 --> 38:34.077
No pressure. I'll just...
I'll just wait.

38:37.615 --> 38:39.382
Can you just try them on?

38:39.384 --> 38:40.950
Oh, my god.

38:40.952 --> 38:44.387
I have my money on lucky number...
One.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.791
What is wrong?!

38:49.393 --> 38:51.594
This. This.

38:51.596 --> 38:53.630
I mean, it's... it's...
It's just...

38:53.632 --> 38:55.832
You know, it's just
not appropriate.

38:58.002 --> 39:01.538
Do you have any idea how much
I fucking hate that word?

39:01.540 --> 39:03.106
'Appropriate'?

39:03.108 --> 39:05.909
We both know what
is not appropriate.

39:06.911 --> 39:09.446
Someone in your position

39:09.448 --> 39:11.748
using it to take advantage.

39:15.653 --> 39:18.521
- Are you blackmailing me?
- Call it what you want, Allan.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.857
You started this, and I
think it's extremely rude

39:20.859 --> 39:22.792
to start something
that you can't finish.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.366
Shelley,

39:29.368 --> 39:31.701
it was never my
intention to hurt you.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.403
Please!

39:33.405 --> 39:35.438
Do you want me to vomit?

39:35.440 --> 39:37.574
Is that what'll get you off?

39:41.412 --> 39:43.046
Ok. Look, it's...

39:44.048 --> 39:45.648
Let's finish it.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.650
- Let's finish this.
- What?

39:47.652 --> 39:49.419
It's finished.

39:49.421 --> 39:50.887
It's finished, ok?

39:50.889 --> 39:52.756
There we go. Are you happy now?

40:33.464 --> 40:35.832
Jesus! Look at that thing.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.600
- Mmm.
- Oh, my god.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.068
What, you trying
to kill yourself?

40:39.070 --> 40:41.171
No pictures. Not like this.

40:41.173 --> 40:43.606
- They'll put me in jail.
- Oh, come on.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.442
- You look cool.
- You think?

40:45.444 --> 40:47.510
Yeah. Way cool.

40:47.512 --> 40:49.746
Can you do any tricks?

40:50.748 --> 40:52.615
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

40:52.617 --> 40:54.217
- Can you skate?
- No.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.019
No. You want me to teach you?

40:56.021 --> 40:58.188
Show me some actual tricks
and I'll think about it.

40:58.190 --> 41:00.056
Oh, actual tricks? Really?

41:00.058 --> 41:02.826
- Well, maybe I don't know any.
- You don't know any?

41:02.828 --> 41:04.661
- Mmm. Ok.
- Not one?

41:04.663 --> 41:06.696
Alright.

41:06.698 --> 41:09.999
This is a make.

41:11.035 --> 41:13.036
- Fin: Whoo!
- Whoo!

41:13.038 --> 41:16.072
And this is a waltz jump.

41:16.074 --> 41:18.541
- Ha-ha.
- Alright, alright.

41:18.543 --> 41:21.177
This is a two-footed spin.

41:21.179 --> 41:22.812
Fin: Whoo!

41:22.814 --> 41:24.814
Yo, skater girl!

41:24.816 --> 41:26.816
Thank you. Mmm.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.719
- But that was so last century.
- Oh, really?

41:29.721 --> 41:31.588
We need something new.
Something interesting.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.823
- Like what?
- Like a jump. Like a ramp.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.159
Hey, don't you turn me
into no skater dude.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.994
Hell, no, sister.
You're the derby queen.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.829
- Derby queen.
- Yeah.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.664
Alright, I'll tell you what.

41:44.802 --> 41:49.105
You clear this and I'll give
you my entire life savings.

41:49.107 --> 41:51.040
- Which is?
- Which is...

41:53.178 --> 41:55.512
- $8.20.
- Wow!

41:55.514 --> 41:58.281
- It's a lot of money.
- Mm-hm.

41:58.283 --> 42:00.650
- Double it.
- Like I said, lady, that's it.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.151
That's, er... That's all I got.

42:02.153 --> 42:04.287
Ok, I'll double it,
but here's the deal.

42:04.289 --> 42:07.790
You lay down, face up,
eyes open, no blinking.

42:07.792 --> 42:10.627
- Make it a 20.
- Ok, great. Perfect.

42:10.629 --> 42:12.195
- Deal.
- You're on.

42:12.197 --> 42:14.030
- No blinking.
- Alright.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.165
Lay down.

42:16.167 --> 42:18.134
I'm watching you.

- I have proof.
- Lucky I trust you.

43:42.787 --> 43:44.787
I have something for you.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.356
- Oh, yes?
- Mm-hm.

43:46.358 --> 43:48.324
Eyes closed. Palms up.

43:48.326 --> 43:50.293
Don't move.

43:57.167 --> 43:59.802
- Can I open it?
- Of course.

44:09.046 --> 44:11.347
This is too weird.

44:15.753 --> 44:19.355
When I was a little girl -
well, not really little -

44:19.357 --> 44:21.124
I became obsessed,

44:21.126 --> 44:23.059
I mean obsessed, with
why men had nipples.

44:23.061 --> 44:26.062
There had to be some
evolutionary purpose, right?

44:26.064 --> 44:28.364
So you see here. Look.

44:28.366 --> 44:30.299
Beetle feeders.

44:30.301 --> 44:32.135
- Beetle feeders?
- Yeah.

44:32.137 --> 44:34.370
You see, that's a man's nipple.
It's a beetle feeder.

44:34.372 --> 44:36.806
That's all they're good for,
really, is feeding beetles.

44:39.778 --> 44:42.812
Ants use their antennae
to stroke the aphids

44:42.814 --> 44:44.347
to let down their milk.

44:44.349 --> 44:47.917
As do the stag beetles
to your nipple.

44:47.919 --> 44:51.354
It's called a symbiotic
relationship.

44:56.860 --> 44:58.995
We should start the day
like this every day.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.965
Getting wasted? Or
on rollerskates?

45:02.967 --> 45:05.435
- With a secret.
- A secret?

45:05.437 --> 45:07.136
Yes.

45:07.138 --> 45:08.971
You know, there isn't
really much to tell.

45:08.973 --> 45:12.108
- I'm pretty boring really.
- Oh, I don't think so.

45:12.110 --> 45:14.143
Ok, I'll go first.

45:14.145 --> 45:16.412
As my mother used to say...

45:18.182 --> 45:20.883
"Evelyn, you have loved
well but not wisely."

45:22.886 --> 45:25.955
I spent half my life saying yes
to men I didn't really love.

45:27.892 --> 45:31.828
Well, maybe you just needed to,
you know, break a few eggs.

45:31.830 --> 45:34.464
Mum used to say that.

45:34.466 --> 45:37.467
You've got to break a few eggs
before you find a good one.

45:37.469 --> 45:39.902
I want to meet your mum.

45:44.074 --> 45:46.309
I actually don't have a mother.

45:46.311 --> 45:48.277
Not anymore.

45:52.282 --> 45:54.217
I'm sorry, fin. I didn't...

45:55.219 --> 45:57.053
It's ok.

45:58.055 --> 46:00.123
She must have been a good mum.

46:03.026 --> 46:05.795
- So it's just you and your dad?
- Yeah.

46:05.797 --> 46:07.864
Yeah, him and his girlfriends.

46:11.903 --> 46:13.770
Oh, he's here already.

46:20.177 --> 46:21.811
Evie?

46:21.813 --> 46:23.546
Evie, open the door.

46:23.548 --> 46:25.381
Evie, let me in. Open the door.

46:25.383 --> 46:27.517
- You need to leave, Vince.
- Open the door.

46:27.519 --> 46:30.419
- Evie, I... Evie!
- You're violating police orders.

46:36.326 --> 46:38.795
- Evie, open the fucking door.
- I don't give a shit.

46:38.797 --> 46:42.398
Dvo or no dvo, we have nothing
left to say to each other.

46:43.400 --> 46:46.435
Evie, I made a mistake.

46:46.437 --> 46:48.938
Evie, I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

46:53.511 --> 46:55.978
Yes, hello. It's Evelyn gray.

46:55.980 --> 46:58.347
My ex-husband's
trying to break in.

46:58.349 --> 47:01.217
He's breaking a dvo.

47:05.122 --> 47:06.856
Evelyn: Oh, my god.

47:06.858 --> 47:09.125
- That's the guy I invited over.
- What?

47:09.127 --> 47:12.562
No, no, no, no. But
he's with her.

47:12.564 --> 47:14.497
- Evelyn: How do you know?
- There you go.

47:14.499 --> 47:16.299
- Hey!
- He's her teacher.

47:16.301 --> 47:18.835
- Are you sure?
- Yes, everyone knows.

47:20.305 --> 47:23.472
Don't you dare run away from me!
Gutless wonder!

47:31.014 --> 47:34.383
Song: ♪ the street's a liar

47:34.385 --> 47:38.888
♪ I'm gonna lure

47:38.890 --> 47:42.291

48:23.233 --> 48:25.101
If there's one thing
I can't stand,

48:25.103 --> 48:27.937
it's people that run and hide.

48:27.939 --> 48:29.605
People that stick their
head in the sand

48:29.607 --> 48:31.941
and just hope things
will go away.

48:31.943 --> 48:35.278
Men who leave messages rather
than doing it to your face.

48:39.616 --> 48:41.684
You don't do that to me.

49:05.475 --> 49:08.144
We can play spider babies.

49:10.514 --> 49:12.949
I'll be the mummy spider

49:12.951 --> 49:15.217
and you can be the baby

49:15.219 --> 49:17.653
and I'll let you suckle me.

49:19.056 --> 49:20.990
Or you could be the mummy

49:20.992 --> 49:22.725
and I'll be the baby

49:22.727 --> 49:25.962
and I can suckle you.

49:28.565 --> 49:31.400
Come on, I'm just joking.

49:37.574 --> 49:39.342
Come on, al. What's...

49:39.344 --> 49:41.410
What happened to you?

49:41.412 --> 49:45.014
A lot. A lot happened, shelley.

49:45.016 --> 49:48.250
Everything happened and I can't...
I can't undo it.

49:48.252 --> 49:50.152
I can't fix it and I can't...

50:10.140 --> 50:11.741
Um...

50:58.789 --> 51:00.556
Fin: It's your lucky day.

51:05.228 --> 51:07.430
I like you, fin.

51:09.199 --> 51:11.100
Actually, I've got
something for you.

51:11.102 --> 51:13.602
Another present?

51:30.187 --> 51:32.488
It's, uh, just a thankyou

51:32.490 --> 51:34.256
for the camera.

51:38.829 --> 51:41.130
With a ribbon and everything.

51:57.581 --> 51:59.348
Evelyn, are you alright?

52:00.350 --> 52:02.218
I'm ok.

52:03.687 --> 52:05.454
It's just been a bad day.

52:05.456 --> 52:07.556
It's ok.

52:14.298 --> 52:16.532
You should go. I don't
want them to see you here.

52:16.534 --> 52:19.335
- You sure?
- Go.

52:22.806 --> 52:24.573
Goodbye.

52:37.587 --> 52:39.588
Um... fin, right?

52:39.590 --> 52:42.424
Hi. Shelley.

52:42.426 --> 52:46.829
- Hi.
- Um, I just, uh...

52:46.831 --> 52:48.931
Can you give your
dad these, please?

52:48.933 --> 52:52.401
Um... he needs a bit
of cheering up.

53:22.332 --> 53:23.899
Al: Fin, can we talk?

53:30.507 --> 53:32.274
Fin?

54:05.442 --> 54:08.310
- Hello?
- Fin: Evelyn, it's fin.

54:08.312 --> 54:09.878
Oh, hey, fin. I'm
just in the bath.

54:09.880 --> 54:11.680
I'll get dressed.

54:37.607 --> 54:40.376
- Are you ok, fin?
- Yeah.

54:40.378 --> 54:42.278
Come in.

54:46.683 --> 54:49.818
- You're not hurt, are you?
- No.

54:49.820 --> 54:52.288
Do you reckon it
would be alright

54:52.290 --> 54:54.957
if I stay here for
a little while?

54:54.959 --> 54:58.427
Does your dad have a girlfriend?

54:58.429 --> 55:00.963
I just need a bit of time
to sort a few things out.

55:00.965 --> 55:02.931
You need to call him, fin.
He'll be worried.

55:02.933 --> 55:05.834
No.

55:10.807 --> 55:12.574
Hello?

55:13.576 --> 55:15.411
Yes, this is her.

55:18.381 --> 55:19.948
Yes, I did.

55:20.950 --> 55:22.751
No.

55:26.756 --> 55:28.524
Yes, I know where to go.

55:30.694 --> 55:32.494
Thank you.

55:40.737 --> 55:42.771
Do you think I could have a hug?

56:35.625 --> 56:38.127
I'm not very well, fin.

56:39.829 --> 56:41.597
You should go.

57:35.051 --> 57:36.852
Al: Dinner!

57:43.860 --> 57:47.062
Come on, fin! This is
getting ridiculous.

57:52.570 --> 57:54.870
Alright, well, I'll put
it in the microwave

57:54.872 --> 57:56.672
and you can sort
it out yourself.

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:57.319
Fin?

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.957
Fin?

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:16.371
Oh, for fu...

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.276
Evelyn?

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:25.140
Jesus!

01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:26.908
Have you broken something?

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.211
Hey, are you ok?

01:02:29.213 --> 01:02:31.747
Come on. Let's get
you to a doctor.

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:33.915
Can you stand?

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:41.423
Are you fucking your student?

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:49.498
- Who told you that?
- Are you?

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:56.037
I fucked up.

01:02:56.039 --> 01:02:57.839
But they're...

01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.541
You know, they're
mistakes that I'm...

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:02.177
..That I'm trying to undo.

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:05.180
How's it going for you? Ow!

01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:07.415
Good... i hope.

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.818
'I hope'. Sounds encouraging.

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.422
Ok. Hey?

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:18.493
Hey, you don't
have to like me...

01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:20.262
Good!

01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:22.864
..But at least let me give
you a lift to a doctor.

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:27.135
Look, I don't want a doctor.
I just want to go home.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.304
Well, then I'll take you home.

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.512
Ok.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:26.588
- Ow.
- Ok.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:29.291
- Oh!
- You alright?

01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:33.194
Ok, let me get that up.

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:37.465
Ok.

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:40.402
No, I'll... I'll do it.

01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:42.938
I'm going to be really
gentle, alright?

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.673
Ok.

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.543
- Evelyn: Ow!
- Al: Sorry.

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:56.318
Aha! What would we do
without frozen peas?

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:01.356
Here.

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:08.363
Can I get you a cup of tea?

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:12.267
I just need my pills on top of
the fridge, if you don't mind.

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:14.469
- In the green container.
- Yep.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.671
And a glass of water.

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.606
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:31.052
That's a lot of pills.

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:35.557
You need a lot of pills if
you're a hypochondriac.

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:43.999
- Ah. Thank you.
- No problem.

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:57.379
Um...

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:35.517
Both: Fin?

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:45.326
Hey! Hey!

01:07:45.328 --> 01:07:48.063
Those photos. Did you take 'em?

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:51.566
Jesus, fin. You can't...

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.535
- You can't stay there.
- What are you gonna do?

01:07:53.537 --> 01:07:55.537
Maybe I'll call the cops
and they can ask her.

01:07:55.539 --> 01:07:57.405
Fin: Go your hardest,
and while you're at it,

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.374
are you going to tell them
you fuck your students?

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:01.142
- Ok. It's up to you.
- Fuck...

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:03.511
Tell me what's going on
or I'll ask her myself.

01:08:03.513 --> 01:08:05.747
Get your class to move in.
You can fuck them all.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:07.515
- You watch your mouth.
- Stay away.

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:09.784
- I'm not going to stay...
- Stay the fuck away!

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:12.787
Fin!

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:42.850
Fuck!

01:09:42.243 --> 01:09:43.810
Fin: Evelyn?

01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:48.550
Evelyn?

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:53.254
Evelyn on recording: <i>Hello.
You've reached bloom.</i>

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:55.690
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:09:55.692 --> 01:10:00.228
Al on phone: Hi, Evelyn.
It's al.

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:05.433
Um... um...

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:11.206
Yep.

01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:51.312
Yes? How can I help?

01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:54.916
Mrs Evelyn... miss Evelyn gray.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.851
Is she here?

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:00.955
Yes, she has checked in,

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:03.491
but it's not visiting hours
until three o'clock.

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:08.763
Oh, ok. Thank you.

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.471
Yes.

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:55.843
- Lyn!
- Lyn: I'll keep this brief.

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:59.414
This was handed in to me today.

01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:02.383
Now, you tell me, do I need
to get that developed?

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.724
Probably not.

01:12:09.726 --> 01:12:13.461
Well, then I think it's best you
pack up your things and go.

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:24.605
Oh, Allan, I did try.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.067
Are you in trouble?

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:58.106
Big trouble?

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:05.847
Is there anything
I can do to help?

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:09.851
What?

01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:13.688
Stay away.

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:15.757
Just stay away.

01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:05.106
Al: Fin, I know you're in there.

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:12.814
Look, I don't want any more trouble.
I just want to talk.

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.484
That's all, ok?

01:14:17.553 --> 01:14:20.855
Fin?

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:53.788
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.623
Oh, fuck!

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:57.625
No! Fuck!

01:14:57.627 --> 01:14:59.260
Fin!

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:01.929
Fin!

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:05.099
Fin! Come on, I need help!

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:06.667
Fuck!

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:12.139
Fuck!

01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:15.943
Fuck.

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:19.046
Fuck!

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:24.886
Fuck. Fuck!

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:40.034
Ahh! Fuck!

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:52.139
Fin: Evelyn?

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:02.383
- Why did you do that?
- What?

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:03.951
Your hair.

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:09.991
It was going to fall out anyway.
I'll grow it back.

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.830
Where are your clothes?

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:18.299
This is what you wear
in hospital, fin.

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:24.071
- It's ugly.
- Yeah, but it's practical.

01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:27.108
I hate practical. I... I
liked you the way you were.

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.713
I can't be the way I was before.

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:34.382
Why?

01:17:37.285 --> 01:17:40.688
- I don't feel the same.
- Why?

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:51.098
Evelyn,

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.801
you are the most beautiful
woman I have ever met.

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:46.921
Are you going to die?

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.304
Al: Fin?

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.349
Get out of my room. Get
the fuck out of my room.

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:24.585
- Mate, who do you think you are?
- Well, you're the arsehole.

01:20:24.587 --> 01:20:26.420
I'm the arsehole?

01:20:26.422 --> 01:20:28.923
Well, I'm just the arsehole
that pays for everything.

01:20:28.925 --> 01:20:31.392
Are you going to do that too
now that I've lost my job?

01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:34.395
Hey, whether you like it or
not, you don't control my life.

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:37.531
And if I want to date a woman
or whatever, then I will.

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:39.834
You're just going to fuck her up!
Just like mum.

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:44.004
Take it back.

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:46.073
Look, your mother
did what she did.

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:47.975
It was her choice, fin.
Not mine.

01:20:47.977 --> 01:20:49.844
How would you know?
You weren't there!

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:58.352
Dad?

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:01.956
Dad.

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:05.326
Dad!

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:11.532
Dad!

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:25.045
Dad!

01:22:51.567 --> 01:22:53.400
Al on phone: Hello, fin?

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:57.338
Fin?

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:03.043
It's ok, I know you
won't pick up.

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:08.749
If you are there, there
may be some cash

01:23:08.751 --> 01:23:11.118
under my jocks in
the top drawer.

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:14.755
Order yourself a pizza.

01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.762
Ok.

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:24.198
'Bye.

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:02.269
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:08.742
Why didn't you tell me?

01:24:08.744 --> 01:24:10.577
Evelyn: You sweet creature.

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:12.539
There's some things you're
better off not knowing.

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:16.550
Like about you and dad?

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:18.385
You never told me
he was your father.

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:21.088
Yeah, well, I wish he wasn't.

01:24:24.826 --> 01:24:26.693
Did he...

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:29.797
..And you?

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:36.103
Come here. I want to
tell you something.

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:45.245
I want you to talk
to your father.

01:24:47.715 --> 01:24:49.750
Will you do that for me?

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:08.602
I made this for you.

01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:11.832
That's beautiful.

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:41.195
Hey.

01:26:41.197 --> 01:26:42.896
Fin: Hi.

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.734
Brought you some clothes.

01:26:47.736 --> 01:26:49.603
Thanks.

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:52.639
Did you get my message?

01:26:52.641 --> 01:26:54.541
Yeah.

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:07.621
What did you tell them?

01:27:07.623 --> 01:27:11.258
I told them that my
son tried to kill me.

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:16.964
No, I just made something up.

01:27:18.499 --> 01:27:20.334
Are you hungry?

01:27:20.336 --> 01:27:22.002
Do you want some of this?

01:27:22.004 --> 01:27:23.870
It's hospital food.

01:27:23.872 --> 01:27:25.739
No, this is good.

01:27:27.475 --> 01:27:29.276
Here.

01:27:29.278 --> 01:27:31.245
Come on.

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:42.256
Try the sausage.

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:33.740
Woman: <i>My love, I
can feel it coming</i>

01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:36.410
<i>and I can't go back there again.</i>

01:28:36.412 --> 01:28:38.412
<i>I'm sorry but I don't
want you to suffer</i>

01:28:38.414 --> 01:28:40.580
<i>more than you already have.</i>

01:28:40.582 --> 01:28:42.883
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

01:28:42.885 --> 01:28:45.786
<i>Take care of our gorgeous boy.</i>

01:28:45.788 --> 01:28:47.621
<i>I love you both.</i>

01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:02.436
I'm sorry.

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:25.092
