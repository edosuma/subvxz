WEBVTT

00:09.096 --> 00:12.838
This is bad. What are Torres
and McGee supposed to do?

00:12.882 --> 00:15.841
Tell the truth.Yeah, that's bad, right?

00:15.885 --> 00:17.278
Hartgrave,
where is he?

00:17.321 --> 00:19.106
According to company security,
he just clocked in.

00:19.149 --> 00:21.847
Okay, let's go.Okay.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.633
Maybe it's not that bad.

00:24.676 --> 00:28.898
That's the United States
Secretary of Defense.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.943
Let's go.He's making house calls now?

00:32.249 --> 00:35.383
Yeah, it's bad.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.821
Gentlemen,

00:38.864 --> 00:41.476
give me a minute.
Director Vance.

00:41.519 --> 00:42.999
Secretary Crawford.
I'd like to...

00:43.043 --> 00:45.306
Not only did NCIS
disobey a direct order,

00:45.349 --> 00:48.048
you hacked classified
government records.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.571
Are these the
agents responsible?

00:49.614 --> 00:52.835
I mean, is it hacking
if you had the password?

00:54.706 --> 00:55.881
Weapons and badges, now.

00:59.581 --> 01:02.671
Director Vance, I'm shutting
down your investigation.

01:02.714 --> 01:05.500
And as for Special Agents

01:05.543 --> 01:09.156
McGee and Torres,

01:09.199 --> 01:11.245
you two are
going to prison.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.076
â™ª

01:44.626 --> 01:46.671
Leon, did NCIS
disobey my order?

01:46.715 --> 01:49.239
Mr. Secretary, I'm playing
catch-up myself.

01:49.283 --> 01:53.374
Did your agents commit a crime?I agree it looks bad.

01:53.417 --> 01:54.897
Doesn't always mean
that there's a crime.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.899
I'm not here for sad stories.You're here for answers.

01:56.942 --> 01:58.596
A federal agency breaking
the law? I have to get

01:58.640 --> 02:00.163
ahead of this before
it breaks to national media.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.078
Then let's make sure
we get it right.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.297
We both want the truth.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.994
Damn skippy.
Are you suggesting

02:05.037 --> 02:06.387
there's a perfectly
good reason for this?

02:06.430 --> 02:07.779
I'm not saying a damn word,

02:07.823 --> 02:09.390
but Agents McGee and Torres

02:09.433 --> 02:10.826
will be happy
to explain,

02:10.869 --> 02:14.656
from the beginning,
in great detail.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.485
As if our necks depended on it?

02:17.528 --> 02:18.790
Oh, they do, son.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.792
Nick, why don't
you start?

02:20.836 --> 02:22.272
What?
:
Yeah.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.970
Why me?You were the one at the seminar.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.624
Only because you made me go
in your place.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.844
Yeah, I had seniority.

02:28.887 --> 02:31.890
Gentlemen, what seminar?

02:32.674 --> 02:34.458
"Optics In Law Enforcement."

02:34.502 --> 02:37.287
Two days ago at
the Freemont Inn.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.768
So boring, am I right?

02:39.811 --> 02:41.161
That training was my idea.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.206
Mm...

02:44.251 --> 02:46.209
I mean, like,
boring...

02:46.253 --> 02:48.994
at first...

02:50.996 --> 02:52.520
This footage was taken
by a neighbor,

02:52.563 --> 02:54.652
and after being posted
to social media,

02:54.696 --> 02:57.438
some are now calling
FBI raid tactics into question.

02:57.481 --> 03:00.484
Okay, before we discuss,
I'd like to thank

03:00.528 --> 03:03.226
our media panelists
for joining us

03:03.270 --> 03:06.838
on the first day
of our three-day seminar.

03:09.493 --> 03:13.149
Now, after watching
that news clip,

03:13.193 --> 03:16.848
can someone suggest
what we, as federal agents,

03:16.892 --> 03:18.372
could do better?

03:18.415 --> 03:20.200
For starters,
never call the FBI.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.550
Anyone?

03:22.593 --> 03:24.378
This could relate
to any aspect

03:24.421 --> 03:25.683
of our job.
Huh.

03:25.727 --> 03:29.470
That's, like, 40 texts
in less than two hours.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.254
You've been counting?

03:31.298 --> 03:32.864
There's nothing else to do

03:32.908 --> 03:34.910
'cause I know all this.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.042
What I don't know is his name.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.783
Whose name?

03:38.827 --> 03:40.872
Oh, the guy you're going
on a date tomorrow night.

03:40.916 --> 03:45.399
All right, stop looking at
my screen, and his name is Boyd.

03:45.442 --> 03:48.184
He's still around?Yeah. It's date number five.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.664
You're counting now?

03:49.707 --> 03:51.143
Are you okay?I'm bored.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.667
Mm-hmm.

03:52.710 --> 03:54.669
Plus, we're not even
supposed to be here.

03:54.712 --> 03:57.585
Something you'd like to add,
Special Agent...

03:57.628 --> 03:59.630
McGee?

04:02.111 --> 04:04.896
Nah, I'm good.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.768
I asked for all cell phones
to be turned off.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.944
I am so sorry,
it belongs to Agent McGee.

04:08.987 --> 04:11.294
I keep telling him
that good police work

04:11.338 --> 04:13.514
starts with being
fully attentive.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.211
Exactly. Thank you,

04:15.255 --> 04:17.779
Agent Gibbs.You are very welcome.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.390
Oh. Oh, no,
it's my, it's my

04:20.434 --> 04:22.784
daughter's school.
There's been an accident.

04:22.827 --> 04:25.308
I-I'm sorry, I have to go.

04:25.352 --> 04:28.224
Oh, my word.
Will he be all right?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.791
You know what?
I don't really know.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.315
I'm gonna go check.
I'm so sorry.

04:32.359 --> 04:35.797
Okay, back to the task at hand:

04:35.840 --> 04:38.582
optics in law enforcement.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.373
Nice job, boss.

04:46.416 --> 04:49.332
Yeah, you, too. The daughter
thing was a nice touch.

04:49.376 --> 04:52.161
Hey, let me tell you something,
Gibbs and McGee owe us big time.

04:52.204 --> 04:54.337
Okay, that's not exactly
how seniority works.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.470
Yeah, I can't take
two more days of this.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.820
Ooh, sounds like a party.

04:58.863 --> 05:03.215
Yeah, Mrs. and Mr. Ned
and Charlene Clutterbuck.

05:03.259 --> 05:04.869
I read it
when we came in.

05:04.913 --> 05:07.219
BISHOP: A love story
for the ages.

05:07.263 --> 05:10.005
Yeah, like
Ellie and Boyd.

05:10.048 --> 05:14.662
Well, I'm starving. I wonder if
the Clutterbucks have a buffet.

05:14.705 --> 05:17.752
Let's find out. You can be the,
uh, the stylish distant cousin

05:17.795 --> 05:19.580
and I can be the
bad-boy boyfriend.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.375
Hello? Everybody
okay in here?

05:32.419 --> 05:33.507
Oh, my God, no!

05:33.550 --> 05:36.945
Whoo, looks like
the bride and the groom

05:36.988 --> 05:38.250
are getting an early start.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.514
Yeah, try the best man
and the maid of honor.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.864
It doesn't matter, Phil.
I think he's dead.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.518
Wha-- Okay, slow down.
Who

05:44.561 --> 05:45.954
Look, we didn't do
anything wrong, okay?

05:45.997 --> 05:47.782
We just came in here
to get some peace and quiet.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.218
Your pants are on backwards.

05:49.261 --> 05:52.395
W-We bumped into a table
and I swear to God

05:52.439 --> 05:54.702
a body fell off of it.
It's back there.

05:54.745 --> 05:57.313
All right, look, why don't
you guys just wait outside?

05:57.357 --> 05:58.445
Yeah.I'll look for the lights.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.055
Okay.Should we find a bathroom?

06:00.098 --> 06:01.578
I'm not in
the mood anymore.

06:01.622 --> 06:05.800
It's freezing in here.

06:08.193 --> 06:11.414
Whoa. I got a body.

06:17.899 --> 06:20.771
Ugh. More like
a graveyard.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.686
Yeah, this is the
wrong kind of buffet.

06:22.730 --> 06:26.124
Yeah, I'm not so hungry anymore.

06:39.137 --> 06:41.531
Don't wait for me.
Continue.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.925
Perhaps you'd like to me to put
the room in SCIF mode, sir,

06:43.968 --> 06:45.317
so we won't
be disturbed.

06:45.361 --> 06:47.015
No need, Leon. I was just
telling my people outside

06:47.058 --> 06:48.233
I won't be
much longer.

06:48.277 --> 06:49.147
I have yet to hear

06:49.191 --> 06:50.453
anything that
changes my mind.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.587
This might help.

06:59.506 --> 07:00.855
Sit down, please.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.726
HARTGRAVE: Oh, no thanks,
I'd rather stand.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.207
It's better for circulation
and breathing.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.427
Wasn't an option. Sit down.What am I looking at?

07:07.470 --> 07:09.907
It's a closed-circuit feed
from our interrogation room.

07:09.951 --> 07:12.823
This suspect is the key
to an investigation

07:12.867 --> 07:14.564
already in full swing.Who is he?

07:14.608 --> 07:17.175
The man who will help us
prevent an act of terrorism.

07:17.219 --> 07:20.831
Terrorism?
You can prove that?

07:20.875 --> 07:22.833
Agents McGee, Torres.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.270
The bodies at the hotel.

07:25.314 --> 07:26.924
Right.

07:26.968 --> 07:29.057
All right, keep clear.
You are all Federal agents.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.754
You know how this works.Everyone,

07:30.798 --> 07:33.235
please make your way
back to the seminar.

07:33.278 --> 07:36.499
Or stay and NCIS will show you
how it's done, baby.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.283
Clearly your daughter's
feeling better.

07:38.327 --> 07:39.371
Come on, people.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.591
Making this a crime scene

07:41.635 --> 07:43.680
was very premature,
Agent Gibbs.

07:43.724 --> 07:46.901
Your agents created chaos
for nothing.

07:46.944 --> 07:49.251
Doesn't look
like nothing.
This hotel

07:49.294 --> 07:52.907
operates with only the highest
standards and class.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.212
Richard!

07:54.256 --> 07:55.953
Um...

07:58.173 --> 08:00.175
I asked for this
nine minutes ago.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.786
As you can see,

08:02.830 --> 08:05.441
there's a medical conference
starting in here

08:05.485 --> 08:06.442
tomorrow morning.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.618
Oh, surgical robots?

08:08.662 --> 08:11.795
The conference is sponsored
by the company that makes them.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.536
The attendees
will be able

08:13.580 --> 08:15.233
to test the robots right here.

08:15.277 --> 08:17.497
On the bodies.
Making them
medical cadavers,

08:17.540 --> 08:19.411
not murder victims.

08:19.455 --> 08:22.632
So can we wrap this up
before the media gets wind

08:22.676 --> 08:26.114
and turns this into
some kind of Jonestown sequel?

08:26.157 --> 08:28.943
Too late. Guy Ross
was already next door.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.249
BISHOP: He's looking
for an interview.

08:31.293 --> 08:34.122
There's nothing illegal here.

08:34.165 --> 08:37.995
These 20 medical cadavers
are completely legal.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.736
We actually counted 21.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.390
Excuse me?McGEE: Yeah.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.913
Same here, 21 bodies.

08:42.957 --> 08:43.958
Oh, no, no, that's ridiculous.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.742
No, no, no. I have the paperwork

08:45.786 --> 08:47.831
right here,
Agent Gibbs.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.572
Clearly your people miscounted.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.922
Or one of these bodies
doesn't belong.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.315
We'll check.

08:56.666 --> 09:00.235
Blackjack, also known as 21.

09:00.278 --> 09:03.325
21-gun salute.
21 is the gambling age.

09:03.368 --> 09:06.284
It's also the drinking age,
and according to a study

09:06.328 --> 09:08.809
which is widely dismissed
by the medical community,

09:08.852 --> 09:13.422
the human soul weighs 21 grams.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.772
Dr. Jim,
what do we know?

09:15.816 --> 09:17.818
21 was a culturally
significant number.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.254
Significant for him.
You got an ID?

09:19.297 --> 09:20.995
I just sent the
prints up to Kasie,

09:21.038 --> 09:23.519
but since this body was
the only body without a toe tag

09:23.563 --> 09:25.608
or any proper paperwork
for cadavers...

09:25.652 --> 09:26.653
Not a cadaver.

09:26.696 --> 09:29.743
Good thing NCIS
was there to count.

09:29.786 --> 09:32.397
This man did have
an internal core temperature

09:32.441 --> 09:33.834
of 75 degrees.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.401
So his time of death was recent.Yeah, last night-ish.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.665
There's no obvious signs
of a cause of death,

09:38.708 --> 09:40.623
though there's some
slight discoloration

09:40.667 --> 09:42.843
in his eyes, as well
as his nose, throat.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.279
Breathed
something bad?

09:44.322 --> 09:46.194
Maybe. He certainly
didn't die of old age.

09:46.237 --> 09:47.674
I'd put him in his late 20s.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.023
Any scars, any markings?

09:49.066 --> 09:51.286
No, no, nothing
outwardly identifying,

09:51.329 --> 09:55.551
which is why we must
look inward.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.727
Might want to step back.

09:57.771 --> 10:00.643
That has to be wrong
because there are no laws

10:00.687 --> 10:02.558
against bodies
in ballrooms.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.039
Apparently, it's a thing. Read.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.302
There are many laws
about unregistered cadavers.

10:09.086 --> 10:10.479
So where did
this guy come from?

10:10.522 --> 10:14.352
I'm hopefully about to find out.

10:24.798 --> 10:27.975
Oh. Oh, that's odd.

10:28.018 --> 10:30.499
What're we looking at?A body without lungs.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.154
They have completely...

10:34.546 --> 10:36.679
disintegrated.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.465
McGEE:
Whoa, whoa. Hold up.

10:40.509 --> 10:43.425
So you did cancel Bishop's date
without asking?

10:43.468 --> 10:47.516
No, I just, all I said was,
uh, uh, "Sorry, work stuff,"

10:47.559 --> 10:49.997
because, you know, she was
too busy working to reply.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.476
Sounds like you cancelled.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.652
Maybe we're getting off topic?

10:52.695 --> 10:54.175
And you're running out of time.

10:54.218 --> 10:55.306
My phone's gonna
ring, telling me

10:55.350 --> 10:56.438
the press conference
is about to start.

10:56.481 --> 10:57.700
Press conference?

10:57.744 --> 10:59.702
Two NCIS agents
are being arrested.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.312
I have to get ahead of this.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.488
So I suggest someone
get to the damn point.

11:03.532 --> 11:04.751
That'd be Tim.

11:04.794 --> 11:05.926
I wasn't in autopsy,

11:05.969 --> 11:07.492
but I was in the bullpen later

11:07.536 --> 11:10.104
when our forensic scientist
came in with news.

11:10.147 --> 11:11.496
Hey.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.715
Hey.
Whoa.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.325
When did this get here?Oh.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.937
Uh, mail cart just came by.
What did you order this time?

11:16.980 --> 11:18.199
What, are you kidding?
I can't afford anything

11:18.242 --> 11:19.635
from Splendifida.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.942
But they do make nice stuff.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.770
You're sure
you didn't gadget splurge?

11:23.813 --> 11:25.554
Maybe in your sleep?

11:25.597 --> 11:28.470
No, Delilah blocked all credit
card access after 11:30 p.m.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.820
It is addressed to me. Weird.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.039
Stop the presses.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.127
Hold the phone.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.345
And the horses.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.782
I just got the
results back

11:35.825 --> 11:37.740
from our body in autopsy,

11:37.784 --> 11:40.308
and we have traveled
back in time.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.962
Is that good or bad?Bad.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.877
Have you ever watched
a science

11:43.920 --> 11:47.663
The space-time continuum
should never be disrupted.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.795
You got a cause of death.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.188
Set the wayback machine
for World War I.

11:51.232 --> 11:54.148
The lungs in our mystery
body have disintegrated

11:54.191 --> 11:57.717
from exposure to toxic
chlorine gas.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.763
The kind banned by the Geneva
Convention as a war crime.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.460
McGEE: Victim
was killed

12:02.504 --> 12:03.940
by a chemical weapon.

12:03.984 --> 12:06.987
Time travel is always bad.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.520
Heads up.Oh.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.522
CRAWFORD: Okay.
Chlorine gas. That's bad.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.567
But I already knew about
this one victim. And, so far,

12:22.611 --> 12:24.178
I haven't seen
any evidence to suggest

12:24.221 --> 12:25.745
a greater threat of terrorism.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.572
GIBBS:
We know about the missing gas.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.400
I'm sorry?

12:29.444 --> 12:32.055
The missing batch
of chemical weapons?

12:32.099 --> 12:34.449
Enough to poison an
entire city block.

12:34.492 --> 12:35.798
What are they talking about?

12:35.842 --> 12:38.018
"A greater threat of terrorism."

12:38.061 --> 12:39.889
McGEE: We had
a mystery dead body

12:39.933 --> 12:42.413
killed by chlorine gas.
That's bad.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.938
But we didn't know how bad
until Kasie came in

12:44.981 --> 12:49.072
and, well, gave
a very moving presentation.

12:49.116 --> 12:52.989
I, uh, I'm gonna need a minute
before my presentation.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.035
You okay?

12:55.078 --> 12:57.689
Totally. Just, uh, need a beat.

12:57.733 --> 13:00.867
Hmm.Yeah, dude. What is
all this stuff?

13:00.910 --> 13:05.393
Drones, VR goggles,
oh, check this out.

13:05.436 --> 13:06.873
This is from their
winter style catalogue.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.352
It's a wristwatch.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.615
It's got a hidden camera
and a hidden knife.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.530
A hidden knife?
Yeah.

13:12.574 --> 13:15.055
Whoa.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.057
I like hidden knives.Yeah.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.580
Was all this stuff free?

13:18.623 --> 13:20.930
You know, I e-mailed
the company last month.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.933
It must be because I pointed
some, uh, U.I. glitches

13:23.977 --> 13:26.806
and software bugs
on my new robotic dog.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.460
It's a Christmas
gift for the twins.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.375
Yeah, of course.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.682
Okay, I'm ready.

13:35.989 --> 13:40.776
Chlorine gas was developed
in 1915 by Fritz Haber.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.386
It was mainly
to get around a treaty

13:42.430 --> 13:44.214
prohibiting the use
of projectiles.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.608
Chlorine hovers at ground level

13:46.651 --> 13:49.654
in yellow-green clouds that
smell like pineapple and pepper.

13:49.698 --> 13:50.742
And melt lungs.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.919
Pure evil, really.
So, of course,

13:52.962 --> 13:56.139
the U.S. and Russia developed
tons of it during the Cold War.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.880
You know, humans can
really suck sometimes.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.751
Which is why we have diplomacy.

13:59.795 --> 14:02.798
Chemical weapons have since
been banned. Peace on Earth.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.191
So if chemicals
have been banned,

14:04.234 --> 14:06.715
how did our dead guy get dead?

14:06.758 --> 14:08.499
Because they haven't
all been destroyed yet.

14:08.543 --> 14:11.676
Destruction is expensive
and slow.

14:11.720 --> 14:15.332
The U.S. stockpile won't be
eliminated until 2023,

14:15.376 --> 14:18.683
at a cost of around $50 billion.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.251
But that's not
the depressing part.It's not?

14:21.295 --> 14:23.601
Chemical weapons
are still in use.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.647
A U.N. report condemned
the Syrian government

14:25.690 --> 14:29.303
for dropping chlorine bombs
on its own people last year,

14:29.346 --> 14:32.567
including civilians
and children.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.745
I can't imagine.

14:36.788 --> 14:39.226
Can we talk about
something happier?

14:39.269 --> 14:41.968
Oh.

14:44.753 --> 14:48.104
Oh, yay. Fingerprints came back

14:48.148 --> 14:50.628
on our grossly
disfigured mystery body.

14:50.672 --> 14:53.893
So much for happier.

14:53.936 --> 14:57.157
MACY:
I can't believe Keenan's dead.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.723
BISHOP: Miss Grant,
uh, when was

14:58.767 --> 15:00.377
the last time you
spoke to your brother?

15:00.421 --> 15:02.031
Last week.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.990
Keenan was the only one
in our family who was actually

15:04.033 --> 15:05.339
on his way to making good,

15:05.382 --> 15:07.036
and now he got
his stupid ass killed.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.169
You blame your brother.You're damn right I do.

15:09.212 --> 15:14.391
After Mom died, he promised me
he wouldn't leave me alone.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.828
We'd like to ask you
a few questions

15:16.872 --> 15:18.830
about his job at, uh...

15:18.874 --> 15:19.875
He worked two jobs.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.572
He was a busboy

15:21.616 --> 15:23.357
at the hellhole I cook at,
but the other one

15:23.400 --> 15:25.750
was a good job
at a nice company.

15:25.794 --> 15:28.710
Trine Chemical Agent
Destruction Plant.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.407
MACY: Keenan was
the only one in our family

15:30.451 --> 15:32.844
who could actually pass
the required background check.

15:32.888 --> 15:35.064
He never had a criminal record.

15:35.108 --> 15:38.938
We think that his job might have
something to do with his death.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.157
He was driving trucks for them.He ever mention chlorine?

15:41.201 --> 15:43.072
Did his job include
handling anything dangerous?

15:43.116 --> 15:45.596
If you want to know about
chemicals, talk to the company.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.555
We are. But...

15:47.598 --> 15:49.470
Keenan didn't
screw up.

15:51.037 --> 15:54.475
I get to blame my baby brother.
You don't.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.609
TORRES:
This place is like Fort Knox.

15:58.653 --> 16:01.003
Well, chemicals can be
just as valuable as gold.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.962
Certainly more dangerous.

16:03.005 --> 16:06.182
I wonder who's watching.
See there?

16:06.226 --> 16:08.010
MAN:
Hi. Excuse me.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.881
You must be NCIS.

16:09.925 --> 16:12.884
My apologies for being so late.
I was all the way across campus.

16:12.928 --> 16:15.148
And, uh, they give us
these golf carts,

16:15.191 --> 16:18.803
but why waste the energy, right?
Dr. Patton Hartgrave.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.110
Hi. Trine's lead
chemical engineer.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.720
So...

16:22.764 --> 16:24.200
Excuse me.

16:24.244 --> 16:26.159
If you, uh, aren't afraid
to look too dorky,

16:26.202 --> 16:27.638
I could show you around.

16:27.682 --> 16:30.293
It's impossible for
me to look dorky.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.730
Right.

16:32.774 --> 16:36.169
HARTGRAVE: So this is
where the magic happens.

16:36.212 --> 16:40.303
We dispose of harmful chemicals
two ways: incineration

16:40.347 --> 16:43.132
and neutralization,
mixing in other agents

16:43.176 --> 16:45.004
to eliminate toxicity.

16:45.047 --> 16:48.050
It's all very
effective, very safe.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.009
Which means it's very expensive.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.620
Well, I can assure you
it's worth every penny.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.883
Where did Keenan Grant work?

16:56.537 --> 16:58.495
Right.

16:58.539 --> 17:01.890
This is, uh...
this is Mr. Grant's locker.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.719
I didn't know him personally,

17:04.762 --> 17:07.156
but of course, we're all very
shocked to hear what happened.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.940
Was he working two nights ago?

17:08.984 --> 17:10.855
Uh, let's see.

17:10.899 --> 17:15.904
Actually, I have access
to those records.

17:15.947 --> 17:18.689
Mm...

17:18.733 --> 17:22.693
Uh, yes. It looks like he
was working that night.

17:22.737 --> 17:26.088
It was a single pickup at
the Freemont Inn in D.C.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.655
That's where his body was found.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.918
What was he picking up?

17:29.961 --> 17:32.399
Some industrial plastic
for recycling.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.053
It's nothing too dangerous.

17:34.096 --> 17:37.404
It's hotel waste,
not Chernobyl, which...

17:37.447 --> 17:41.016
was an ecological warning sign
nobody took seriously enough.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.105
You seem very, uh,
Earth-friendly

17:43.149 --> 17:44.846
for a chemical guy.

17:44.889 --> 17:48.850
Hey, I'm just correcting some
of mankind's worst mistakes.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.547
Like destroying chlorine gas.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.897
That's impossible.

17:52.941 --> 17:57.250
Oh, uh, Agents McGee and Torres,
this is George Ashley Green,

17:57.293 --> 17:58.903
our fearless leader.

17:58.947 --> 18:01.558
: Well, CEO
of Trine Chemical, anyway.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.386
I happened to see
you two come in.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.084
I knew somebody was watching.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.042
McGEE: Why is destroying
chlorine gas impossible?

18:07.086 --> 18:10.176
Because we haven't
had any for years.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.265
It was all destroyed
per previous

18:12.308 --> 18:13.440
military contracts.

18:13.483 --> 18:14.528
What about current contracts?

18:14.571 --> 18:16.356
None, for chlorine.

18:16.399 --> 18:19.359
But that's all I can really say
without clearance.

18:19.402 --> 18:20.969
National security concerns.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.405
You understand.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.015
I need permission
from the Pentagon.

18:28.672 --> 18:29.978
Hey, Bishop. Go.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.284
BISHOP :
The DoD is pushing

18:31.327 --> 18:33.547
your meeting time, again.

18:33.590 --> 18:34.896
Actually, they cancelled

18:34.939 --> 18:36.463
and suggested
you come back tomorrow.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.204
Oh, no. No, no, no.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.206
I'm not going anywhere
until I get some answers.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.946
That's what I told them,
but they kept citing

18:41.990 --> 18:45.124
"national security concerns"
without any details.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.777
Uh, Bishop?

18:46.821 --> 18:49.215
I'll call you back.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.218
Good afternoon.

18:52.261 --> 18:53.567
Special Agent Gibbs, right?

18:53.610 --> 18:55.264
Wynn Crawford.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.483
Yes, sir.I just got done

18:56.526 --> 18:58.702
talking about
your team with SECNAV.

18:58.746 --> 19:01.488
She had quite a few stories
about you, all good.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.490
I'll bet.About your meeting...

19:03.533 --> 19:05.100
Uh, it was cancelled.By me.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.406
But since you're here, I figured

19:06.449 --> 19:07.755
I'd give you
the bad news in person.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.887
Pentagon records have been
temporarily locked.

19:09.931 --> 19:12.107
By you.
No, by State.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.630
They're currently working
with the U.N.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.545
on a cease-fire agreement
in Syria.

19:15.589 --> 19:18.026
Your requests sent up red flags.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.898
Chemical weapons investigations
make people nervous.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.509
So do chemical attacks.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.206
Yeah, see, that's exactly

19:24.250 --> 19:26.643
the kind of reckless talk
that we can't afford.

19:26.687 --> 19:27.992
Now, do you have proof

19:28.036 --> 19:29.080
of intended terrorism?

19:29.124 --> 19:30.473
Or missing weapons?

19:30.517 --> 19:32.083
You're making it hard
to find proof.

19:32.127 --> 19:34.173
Well, find a different way,
and I'll be happy to help.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.697
I want justice
for your victim.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.525
But Marine to Marine?

19:38.568 --> 19:41.702
There are a lot bigger things
at play here on the world stage.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.921
We can do both, Mr. Secretary.

19:43.965 --> 19:47.316
This was a courtesy,
not a negotiation.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.231
Now, unless NCIS

19:49.275 --> 19:54.236
has concrete evidence of missing
weapons-- actual weapons--

19:54.280 --> 19:56.107
you will stand down.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.676
That's an order.

20:07.118 --> 20:10.165
So, Gibbs told you
about my order

20:10.209 --> 20:12.428
to stand down, and you
still failed to follow it.

20:12.472 --> 20:15.257
I don't always agree
with Gibbs myself, sir,

20:15.301 --> 20:17.216
but I do trust his judgment,

20:17.259 --> 20:20.001
and the judgment
of my people here at NCIS.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.002
If they didn't follow your
order, it's because

20:21.045 --> 20:22.699
there are missing weapons.

20:22.743 --> 20:25.049
And the chemical engineer
sitting in interrogation...

20:25.093 --> 20:27.095
Can tell us everything?Keep watching.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.662
My people know how
to break this guy.

20:28.705 --> 20:30.533
:
I'm not saying a word,

20:30.577 --> 20:31.882
so just arrest me
or be done.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.144
SLOANE:
I'm sorry,

20:33.188 --> 20:34.537
are we keeping you
from something?

20:34.581 --> 20:35.973
Hot date, maybe?

20:43.024 --> 20:45.069
Oh, God!

20:46.332 --> 20:48.159
Cat's out of the bag.

20:48.203 --> 20:51.511
Guess you could say
my hot date's with Mother Earth.

20:51.554 --> 20:53.034
Six feet under.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.644
You were exposed to the gas.

20:54.688 --> 20:57.517
Not much, but enough.

20:59.562 --> 21:02.652
I'll be dead before
you can get me to talk.

21:02.696 --> 21:03.784
I'll get the kit.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.220
Sorry.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.396
Well, I guess NCIS is done here.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.237
SLOANE:
You need medical attention.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.543
We're calling the paramedics.

21:23.586 --> 21:24.631
HARTGRAVE: No, no, no,
it's too late for that.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.328
I told you I don't want that.

21:26.372 --> 21:28.199
The fact that this man
is coughing up blood

21:28.243 --> 21:29.810
means that we are right.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.116
Sir, there is missing
chlorine gas,

21:32.160 --> 21:33.509
and this man knows
where it is.

21:33.553 --> 21:36.425
And you found this out how?

21:36.469 --> 21:38.993
You seem to have forgotten
the part of the story

21:39.036 --> 21:40.647
where you two committed
a federal offense.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.213
In fact, if I didn't know
any better,

21:42.257 --> 21:44.041
I'd say you're
deliberately stalling.

21:44.085 --> 21:46.305
Not at all.
No way.

21:46.348 --> 21:49.220
Dating habits,
text messages, free gadgets.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.614
These are all essential
to your work here at NCIS?

21:51.658 --> 21:54.356
Actually, yeah.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.227
Hey, Nick.What up?

21:56.271 --> 21:59.143
Did you cancel
my date last night?

21:59.187 --> 22:00.362
Good morning.

22:00.406 --> 22:01.972
I was supposed to have
a date last night,

22:02.016 --> 22:05.715
but according to Boyd,
I cancelled it.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.282
You sent a message

22:07.326 --> 22:09.458
without telling me.Gibbs was standing right there.

22:09.502 --> 22:10.546
What do you want me to do,
let you get in trouble?

22:10.590 --> 22:12.809
For getting a text message?

22:12.853 --> 22:14.158
That doesn't make any sense.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.725
He didn't even know
who it was from.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.336
Yeah, he didn't care, either.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.163
Pentagon records. Go.

22:19.207 --> 22:21.905
Well, we still don't have
permission to access files.

22:21.949 --> 22:24.081
In order to find
missing chemical weapons,

22:24.125 --> 22:25.735
we're gonna have
to hack into the Pentagon,

22:25.779 --> 22:27.258
which is a little risky.

22:27.302 --> 22:28.738
And a lot illegal.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.566
Find a different way.We may already have.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.613
Torres and I are able to
access the next best thing.

22:33.656 --> 22:35.745
Records to Trine
Chemical itself.

22:35.789 --> 22:39.140
Uh, I'm sorry.
Nick is helping you hack?

22:39.183 --> 22:40.141
Hell yeah.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.795
Hmm.
Well, in my own way.

22:41.838 --> 22:44.101
There was a hidden camera, and
it was recording the entire time

22:44.145 --> 22:46.147
while we were at the company.McGEE: Including when Hartgrave

22:46.190 --> 22:48.932
entered his admin password.It was by accident.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.457
McGEE: Virginia is a one-party
consent state for recording.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.675
BISHOP:
You tracked his keystrokes?

22:52.719 --> 22:54.677
We do have a warrant
for security records

22:54.721 --> 22:56.418
pertaining to our victim,
Keenan Grant.

22:56.462 --> 22:59.552
Which doesn't cover
records of chemical weapons.

22:59.595 --> 23:01.684
So we don't download those.On purpose.

23:01.728 --> 23:04.861
What about SecDef's order
to stand down?

23:04.905 --> 23:06.341
Boss?

23:07.821 --> 23:09.170
Do it, McGee.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.435
All right, well, I suggest
you download as much as you can

23:13.479 --> 23:14.871
as fast as you can.

23:14.915 --> 23:16.090
Why?

23:16.133 --> 23:17.570
A company this big
has security protocols

23:17.613 --> 23:18.919
tracing outside IPs.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.703
Which is why
I created a program

23:20.747 --> 23:22.749
that'll alert me if I...

23:22.792 --> 23:24.272
McGEE and BISHOP:
Ooh.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.711
Alert me if I'm being traced.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.626
Did they find you?Wrong question.

23:30.670 --> 23:31.888
Did you get the file?

23:31.932 --> 23:33.455
Well, luckily, I was able to

23:33.499 --> 23:35.718
directly download
to a secure backup.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.851
Just need someone's computer
to open it.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.680
There's our victim

23:40.723 --> 23:43.117
the night of his death.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.597
He was working that night.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.295
TORRES: Hold up.
So was our scientist.

23:47.338 --> 23:48.731
McGEE:
He lied to us.

23:48.775 --> 23:51.342
Why would the lead engineer
go on a random pickup?

23:51.386 --> 23:53.954
Unless there was something
very valuable on that truck.

23:53.997 --> 23:56.435
Like chlorine

23:56.478 --> 23:58.959
It's time to ask.
I'll get Gibbs.

23:59.002 --> 24:00.090
VANCE:
No need.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.136
Director.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.964
Gibbs.

24:04.007 --> 24:06.183
I just received a call
from Trine Chemical.

24:06.227 --> 24:09.535
Their cyber security
department, actually.

24:09.578 --> 24:14.670
Did NCIS just participate
in a felony by hacking?

24:14.714 --> 24:18.108
It's, uh, it's more
of a gray area, sir.

24:21.895 --> 24:24.506
This is bad.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.899
What are Torres and McGee
supposed to do?

24:25.942 --> 24:27.509
Tell the truth.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.424
Yeah, that's bad, right?

24:29.468 --> 24:31.034
Hartgrave.
Where is he?

24:31.078 --> 24:32.993
According to company security,
he just clocked in.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.516
Okay, let's go.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.214
Okay. Maybe it's not that bad.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.046
That's the United States
Secretary of Defense.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.092
Let's go.He's making house calls now?

24:46.310 --> 24:48.487
Yeah. It's bad.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.707
Which brings us to now.

24:51.751 --> 24:53.883
TORRES:
So, as you can see,

24:53.927 --> 24:57.452
our scientist lied about
being there and the gas.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.194
Yes. Yes, I do see.

25:00.237 --> 25:01.935
I also see the need to
ask for Agent Gibbs' badge

25:01.978 --> 25:04.546
for allowing his agents
to break so many laws.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.548
NCIS had a warrant, sir.

25:06.592 --> 25:10.117
And a reasonable fear that
Hartgrave could alter records

25:10.160 --> 25:11.901
if traditionally approached.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.816
Hence the shrewd
computer tactics.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.601
Exactly.Yeah, what he said.

25:15.644 --> 25:17.472
You stole government records.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.430
We proved that Hartgrave
was there.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.955
At ground zero,
with the missing chlorine.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.392
We have to assume it's going
to be used for an attack.

25:24.435 --> 25:26.307
Sir, this guy knows
all the details.

25:26.350 --> 25:27.874
McGEE:
NCIS is going to break him.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.571
We just need more time.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.315
Damn skippy.

25:35.664 --> 25:36.709
GIBBS :
Medical's on the way.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.841
I won't accept their help.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.323
Why not, Patton?

25:42.366 --> 25:44.064
Is it shame?

25:44.107 --> 25:45.413
Guilt?

25:45.456 --> 25:46.719
A man's dead.

25:46.762 --> 25:47.763
And you were there.

25:48.808 --> 25:49.939
We have you
with the victim

25:49.983 --> 25:51.332
the night of his death
and at the hotel

25:51.375 --> 25:52.594
where his body was found.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.944
He found out you
stole the chlorine, right?

25:54.988 --> 25:56.163
You killed him.
No.

25:56.206 --> 25:58.295
I...

25:58.339 --> 26:00.471
"I..."
Come on, finish the sentence.

26:00.515 --> 26:01.647
"I am a murderer."

26:03.039 --> 26:05.302
Aw, come on, man. Own it.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.827
Keenan's death was
an accident.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.002
I tried to save him.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.743
That's when you were exposed?Yes.

26:10.786 --> 26:13.833
I was going to unload
the chlorine safely...

26:13.876 --> 26:14.834
From the truck?

26:14.877 --> 26:16.183
It's not like I could

26:16.226 --> 26:17.750
back my car up to
the loading dock.

26:17.793 --> 26:20.753
But, uh...

26:20.796 --> 26:23.669
...when we got to the hotel,
Keenan, he found the crate

26:23.712 --> 26:25.366
and opened it before
I could stop him.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.194
His crowbar must
have slipped, or--

26:27.237 --> 26:30.023
He was dead by the time
I closed the valve.

26:30.066 --> 26:32.199
You saw the medical cadavers
and hid the body.

26:32.242 --> 26:33.853
GIBBS:
Wait,

26:33.896 --> 26:37.944
a good man
was doing his job,

26:37.987 --> 26:39.162
and you don't feel guilt?

26:39.206 --> 26:41.643
I do, about that.

26:41.687 --> 26:44.254
Oh, but stealing barbaric
chemical weapons

26:44.298 --> 26:46.300
that could kill hundreds,
you're cool with that?

26:46.343 --> 26:48.041
Steal. Right.
How can you steal

26:48.084 --> 26:49.869
something that wasn't
even in our records?

26:49.912 --> 26:52.001
I found the canisters
in the vault.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.046
And tookthem.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.569
They weren't gonna miss it.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.789
Where's the gas?

26:58.051 --> 27:00.836
You know, I wanted
to believe that

27:00.880 --> 27:02.533
I was doing my part

27:02.577 --> 27:06.625
to peacefully right
a few wrongs in this world.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.627
It wasn't enough.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.585
Evil plays offense.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.022
Right. So now you are, too.

27:13.066 --> 27:14.850
Not me.

27:14.894 --> 27:19.289
No, the citizens being gassed
by their own government.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.857
They need a weapon
just as strong.

27:21.901 --> 27:25.034
We armed the Afghans
against the Russians, right?

27:25.078 --> 27:27.297
Or what about the Contras
in the '80s?

27:27.341 --> 27:28.385
Where is the gas?!

27:28.429 --> 27:30.866
On its way to freedom fighters.

27:30.910 --> 27:33.303
They understand what
I'm trying to accomplish.

27:33.347 --> 27:36.698
Have you seen the videos
of those kids dying?

27:36.742 --> 27:38.569
Please listen to me.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.615
Your supposed nobility
is gonna get

27:40.659 --> 27:42.704
a lot more people killed.No.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.402
No, the gas will be
in good hands...

27:45.446 --> 27:46.795
...once it gets to Syria.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.797
Members of terrorist
organizations

27:48.841 --> 27:51.539
have been known to join
your freedom fighters

27:51.582 --> 27:54.324
to gain intel
or to steal weapons.

27:54.368 --> 27:55.935
You don't know where
the gas will end up, do you?

27:55.978 --> 27:57.937
SLOANE: Word about these kind
of things gets around.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.416
Bad guys come out
of the woodwork.

27:59.460 --> 28:03.594
No. What's done is done.

28:04.944 --> 28:06.467
I hope you have
some ideas, Ellie.

28:06.510 --> 28:07.729
I don't know how
to reach this guy.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.035
Well, he'll admit
to everything,

28:09.078 --> 28:10.210
but won't give up the gas.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.211
You can't argue with crazy.

28:11.254 --> 28:12.429
Oh, he's not crazy.

28:12.473 --> 28:13.561
He's principled.

28:13.604 --> 28:14.867
That's how he sees it.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.825
His last act on earth
is totally righteous.

28:16.869 --> 28:19.567
Until it's not,
but by then, he'll be dead.

28:19.610 --> 28:21.612
We need more time.

28:23.353 --> 28:26.008
No, no more time, Director.

28:26.052 --> 28:27.444
There's missing gas out there.

28:27.488 --> 28:29.446
Sir, that's what
we've been saying.

28:29.490 --> 28:30.752
All the more reason
to turn it over to Homeland

28:30.796 --> 28:32.711
and the FBI as soon
as possible.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.713
As far as Agent Gibbs
and his team are concerned,

28:34.756 --> 28:36.105
they'll get their
day in court.

28:36.149 --> 28:38.151
We'll be discreet.VANCE: I don't give a damn

28:38.194 --> 28:40.370
about appearances, sir.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.111
There are chemical
weapons out there.

28:42.155 --> 28:44.113
And you want to waste time
transferring the case

28:44.157 --> 28:46.768
when the lead suspect is--
is right in front of us.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.639
CRAWFORD: That press conference
is ready to begin.I have an idea.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.859
Me, too.
What's yours?
CRAWFORD:
Anything else?

28:50.903 --> 28:53.514
VANCE: Secretary Crawford,
you are making a big mistake.That's what I was thinking.

28:53.557 --> 28:56.996
You're right, but the mistake
is wasting time in here.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.002
[window shutters humming,
door locks]

29:11.967 --> 29:13.577
Agent Torres,
what the hell are you doing?

29:15.318 --> 29:16.624
Yeah, what are you doing?

29:16.667 --> 29:19.192
Wait, this wasn't your idea?

29:19.235 --> 29:20.933
No, SCIF mode was my idea.

29:20.976 --> 29:22.630
Then why did you look at
my gun on the table?

29:22.673 --> 29:23.979
I wasn't looking at your gun.

29:24.023 --> 29:26.112
Director Vance,

29:26.155 --> 29:27.678
are your agents threatening

29:27.722 --> 29:29.724
the United States Secretary
of Defense?

29:32.553 --> 29:35.164
I certainly hope not.

29:47.916 --> 29:51.485
I figure every 20 minutes
you hold me hostage,

29:51.528 --> 29:53.443
there's another year
on your sentence.

29:53.487 --> 29:56.490
Huh Hostage?

29:56.533 --> 29:58.318
Well, that's what you're
doing, isn't it?No. No, no, no.

29:58.361 --> 29:59.406
Not at all.

29:59.449 --> 30:02.061
Well, SCIF mode cuts
cell service...

30:02.104 --> 30:03.062
and you're armed.

30:03.105 --> 30:05.325
Oh

30:05.368 --> 30:07.414
Oh, no, this is, uh,
it's still holstered.

30:07.457 --> 30:09.546
Yeah, we-we're merely
asking for more time, sir.

30:09.590 --> 30:12.549
Your suspect isn't gonna talk.
He's made that quite clear.

30:12.593 --> 30:15.552
I told you,
I don't want any medical help.

30:20.296 --> 30:22.864
Hey!

30:22.908 --> 30:24.561
I want my phone call!

30:26.433 --> 30:30.219
I... I-- geez,
I want to talk to my mom.

30:30.263 --> 30:33.048
Security lockdown on...Going on lockdown.

30:33.092 --> 30:36.704
MAN: We got first responders
on the ground...

30:45.800 --> 30:46.932
GIBBS:
No.

30:46.975 --> 30:48.759
Bishop, no. Stop, stop.

30:48.803 --> 30:51.545
You stay there. No!

30:51.588 --> 30:53.460
Y-You keep me informed.

30:55.897 --> 30:58.030
Hey. What's

30:58.073 --> 31:00.075
Is something wrong?

31:02.991 --> 31:05.515
Authorities are just arriving
on the scene.

31:05.559 --> 31:08.562
Metro bomb squad and hazmat
teams have entered the building.

31:08.605 --> 31:12.000
While federal authorities have
yet to issue a formal statement,

31:12.044 --> 31:14.873
police are asking everyone
in the greater D.C. area

31:14.916 --> 31:16.744
to remain in their homes.

31:16.787 --> 31:19.225
Your gas was used in an attack.

31:19.268 --> 31:22.445
Again, here is the footage
WJGZ received earlier,

31:22.489 --> 31:23.882
taken with a cell phone.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.623
This video may not be suitable
for younger viewers.

31:42.422 --> 31:43.858
MAN:
Go, go, go!

31:43.902 --> 31:46.817
No. This doesn't make any sense.

31:46.861 --> 31:49.124
Of course it doesn't.It's terrorism!

31:49.168 --> 31:50.386
Which means
your last act on Earth

31:50.430 --> 31:51.735
will be the killing
of innocent people.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.389
Think that'll fit
on your headstone?

31:53.433 --> 31:55.870
I'll make sure it does.No, no. That's not...

31:55.914 --> 31:58.917
That's-that's not what I...Well, then, you give me
someone else to blame!

31:58.960 --> 32:02.746
Uh, okay, uh, I-I gave the crate
to a customs agent.

32:02.790 --> 32:04.487
Address.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.925
Uh, he didn't know
what was inside.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.448
He must have opened it.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.541
Leon, is this
what I think it is?

32:22.984 --> 32:24.943
I'll be damned.

32:28.555 --> 32:30.426
I'm now being toldClosed circuit,
channel five.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.385
the hotel has been evacuated,
and that emergency services

32:32.428 --> 32:35.170
are continuing to fan out
throughout the area...

32:35.214 --> 32:37.825
Hey, uh, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Ross,

32:37.868 --> 32:39.174
but you can stop reading now.

32:44.484 --> 32:48.967
The, uh, script ended,
so I improvised that last part.

32:49.010 --> 32:50.707
I hope that was okay.Agent Bishop texted me.

32:50.751 --> 32:51.970
You were perfect.

32:52.013 --> 32:55.625
Mr. Secretary,
Mr. Director.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.018
Thank you so much
for allowing me

32:57.062 --> 32:58.454
to be a part
of your operations drill.

32:58.498 --> 33:01.980
I, uh, have to say,
this was a new one for me.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.633
Yeah. Us, too.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.679
Miss Hines, this broadcast

33:05.722 --> 33:08.464
was only sent via
closed circuit, right?

33:08.508 --> 33:10.814
Yes. Our building only,
Director.CRAWFORD: The footage,

33:10.858 --> 33:13.121
the running people.Uh, the agents

33:13.165 --> 33:15.515
at the seminar,
they were happy to help.

33:15.558 --> 33:18.909
We told them it was an exercise
in "Optics In Law Enforcement."

33:18.953 --> 33:20.824
And the bodies
were the cadavers.

33:20.868 --> 33:22.478
Not exactly, sir,

33:22.522 --> 33:25.351
but I like where your head
is at.

33:26.395 --> 33:29.007
I'm so sorry, uh, Mr. Secretary.

33:31.183 --> 33:32.706
Where the hell is Gibbs?

33:38.755 --> 33:40.496
Federal agents.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.542
Hey, put your hands
in the air.

33:42.585 --> 33:43.934
Back away from the container.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.612
Oh, looks good.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.791
All clear, six-eight.

34:22.321 --> 34:25.541
BISHOP:
Wow. These are old, huh?

34:25.585 --> 34:29.067
Why weren't they destroyed?

34:29.110 --> 34:32.374
Recovering that gas
does not absolve NCIS.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.724
In addition to disobeying
orders, illegal hacking

34:34.768 --> 34:37.075
and-and threatening a government
official, you can add...

34:37.118 --> 34:39.338
well, hell, I don't even know
what to call this charade.

34:39.381 --> 34:41.209
It's not coercion and
it's not entrapment.

34:41.253 --> 34:43.690
Not helping, Agent McGee.And I blame you, Leon.

34:43.733 --> 34:46.388
Is this how you run your house?
And where the hell is Gibbs?

34:46.432 --> 34:48.695
Right here.

34:48.738 --> 34:50.610
Gibbs, you can add your badge
to the growing pile.

34:55.615 --> 34:58.052
You should have this, too.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.619
And what's that?

34:59.662 --> 35:03.405
Trine Chemical said they
destroyed all their chlorine,

35:03.449 --> 35:04.580
per military
contracts.

35:04.624 --> 35:06.060
Well, that's total BS.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.454
Yeah, they lied to save a
buck. Millions, actually.

35:08.497 --> 35:09.846
We went through their records.

35:09.890 --> 35:10.978
Illegally obtained.

35:11.021 --> 35:12.327
No, pretty sure
we had a warrant.

35:12.371 --> 35:13.763
BISHOP:
When this is all over,

35:13.807 --> 35:15.983
company stock will crash.Let it.

35:16.026 --> 35:18.812
They defrauded the United States
government. Your point?

35:18.855 --> 35:20.944
My point, sir, is that you
are a major shareholder,

35:20.988 --> 35:22.337
and you stand to lose
a lot of money.

35:22.381 --> 35:24.296
You think I stepped in
because of money?

35:24.339 --> 35:26.298
Or your friendship with the CEO.

35:26.341 --> 35:29.301
I-It never occurred to me
that...

35:29.344 --> 35:32.652
I had no idea Trine was involved
when State asked me to step in.

35:32.695 --> 35:34.175
Relax. We know.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.351
And I haven't talked
to George Green in months.

35:36.395 --> 35:37.744
Certainly not in the last
few days. We checked.

35:37.787 --> 35:40.964
Geez, this looks bad.

35:41.008 --> 35:43.141
Doesn't always mean
there was a crime.

35:43.184 --> 35:44.838
Right, Director?

35:47.797 --> 35:50.844
I guess NCIS
weren't the only ones

35:50.887 --> 35:52.237
who jumped the gun a little.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.542
Outside of briefings,

35:53.586 --> 35:55.022
and the occasional
social gathering,

35:55.065 --> 35:56.589
you and I don't know
each other, Leon.

35:56.632 --> 35:59.026
I assumed the worst.

35:59.069 --> 36:01.202
Well, we all make mistakes.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.335
Yes, as Agent Gibbs and his
team have just reminded me.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.032
Well, if that's
it, Director,

36:05.075 --> 36:07.469
I got a press
conference to attend.

36:07.513 --> 36:09.167
Sir?
I have to get
in front of this.

36:09.210 --> 36:14.128
Take responsibility for my part,
and congratulate NCIS on theirs.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.261
Maybe next time,

36:16.304 --> 36:19.960
we could both be
a little more careful. Yeah?

36:30.579 --> 36:32.668
TORRES:
Nope.

36:32.712 --> 36:33.800
Well done.

36:33.843 --> 36:36.063
This is yours.Oh. Thank you.

36:36.106 --> 36:37.847
In a news conference
addressing this discovery,

36:37.891 --> 36:40.241
United States Secretary
of Defense Wynn Crawford

36:40.285 --> 36:42.287
noted that the allegations
against Trine Chemical

36:42.330 --> 36:44.027
are an isolated event.

36:44.071 --> 36:46.987
Wow, a politician willing
to admit that he was wrong.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.554
It's refreshing.TORRES:
I knew everything

36:48.597 --> 36:50.338
was gonna be fine.

36:50.382 --> 36:52.558
I never doubted Gibbs
one second.

36:52.601 --> 36:54.429
I did. But I'm learning.

36:58.955 --> 37:01.044
Hey, Ellie?

37:01.088 --> 37:02.089
Hmm?

37:02.132 --> 37:04.222
You have a sec?

37:04.265 --> 37:05.962
Yeah. What's up?

37:08.878 --> 37:11.838
I just wanted to apologize
about your date.

37:11.881 --> 37:14.710
Next time that Boyd and you
go out to dinner,

37:14.754 --> 37:16.234
uh, it'll be on me.

37:16.277 --> 37:19.498
Thanks, but it's not about that.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.326
Okay.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.763
We have to trust
each other, Nick,

37:23.806 --> 37:26.548
for the big things
and the small things.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.202
It matters.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.900
It was a mistake.
I shouldn't have sent that text.

37:30.944 --> 37:32.250
So why did you?

37:36.341 --> 37:39.648
Okay. Good night, Nick.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.304
Ellie, wait.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.488
Good night.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.634
Kasie, hey.

38:08.677 --> 38:10.679
Did you, uh, get anything
you wanted from here?

38:10.723 --> 38:12.159
'Cause I don't need
all this stuff.

38:12.202 --> 38:14.161
Oh, I'm good. What I really want

38:14.204 --> 38:15.728
is one of
their Nixie tube clocks.

38:15.771 --> 38:18.252
Oh, those are cool.I know, right?

38:18.296 --> 38:20.820
I even called the company
to see what it would take

38:20.863 --> 38:22.474
to send me one for free,
like you.

38:22.517 --> 38:24.563
Really?

38:24.606 --> 38:25.999
Yeah, I offered to test
all their products

38:26.042 --> 38:28.001
and point out bugs and stuff,

38:28.044 --> 38:31.570
but they said they don't send
free gift boxes, ever.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.180
They said
they only send goodies

38:33.223 --> 38:37.489
to, like, prospective employees.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.579
Okay. I'm being headhunted.

38:40.622 --> 38:42.537
Yeah, you are.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.147
And?

38:44.191 --> 38:45.714
And it feels pretty good.

38:45.758 --> 38:47.716
I knew it.
You're gonna leave NCIS

38:47.760 --> 38:50.153
for a sexy,
multimillion dollar job

38:50.197 --> 38:52.939
at one of the coolest
tech companies in the world.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.942
No, no, no. I mean, I am--
well, I'm being offered

38:55.985 --> 39:00.990
a lot of money, but, uh,
you know, really, it's...

39:01.034 --> 39:03.166
Please don't tell anyone.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.212
I would never
tell anyone, McGee.

39:05.255 --> 39:08.346
But they are detectives.

39:14.656 --> 39:16.049
How y'all doing?

39:16.092 --> 39:18.573
Don't let that stuff
go to your head now.

39:18.617 --> 39:22.360
Sorry I'm late.

39:22.403 --> 39:25.754
Someone in your position
is never late.

39:25.798 --> 39:28.235
CIA was surprised
to get your call, sir.

39:28.278 --> 39:31.194
I understand you've been
tracking Leon Vance.

39:34.502 --> 39:36.417
No idea
what you're talking about.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.593
I want everything you have.

39:38.637 --> 39:41.683
Is this business or pleasure?

39:41.727 --> 39:44.294
Now, how's
the salmon here?
