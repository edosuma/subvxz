WEBVTT

01:16.576 --> 01:19.705
What is this thing
that pulls me,

01:19.705 --> 01:25.961
I drift so far away,

01:25.961 --> 01:29.840
to your side

01:29.840 --> 01:33.593
a breath of wind,

01:36.263 --> 01:39.599
when the ice cracks

01:39.599 --> 01:42.602
to let you in

01:58.368 --> 02:07.502
stirs in my soul

02:39.034 --> 02:45.374
and I still can't figure out

02:48.001 --> 02:50.670
shut my mouth

02:50.670 --> 02:53.215
- Take it all off, whooo!

02:55.050 --> 02:58.929
the chains on me

02:58.929 --> 03:05.644
we could set each other free

03:08.814 --> 03:16.446
spirits of old

03:45.308 --> 03:48.186
- Jordie? Did we?

03:48.186 --> 03:50.188
- No, we didn't.

03:52.315 --> 03:57.362
- Sam, Emma, here's your Dad's
brother, Jordie. Your uncle.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.323
- But we already
have an uncle. Uncle Noah.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.162
- You been driving all night?

04:05.162 --> 04:09.916
- Looks like it. I'm guessin'.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.335
- We don't really
have a guest room.

04:14.129 --> 04:17.466
- I'm looking after that place
over there, 'til it sells.

04:17.466 --> 04:21.595
The Ferguson place. You can
stay there a night or two.

04:21.595 --> 04:26.183
No longer, we got kids.

04:26.183 --> 04:31.188
- That's it?
No "Hey, bro, how's it going?"

04:31.188 --> 04:33.607
- Come on, Sam, Emma.
Carrots need peeling.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.984
- But Ma, but Ma, I wanna-
- Sam.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.320
- But we already have an uncle-
- Emma.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.988
- Ugh.

04:48.163 --> 04:52.167
- Heard you built here.
On the water.

04:56.421 --> 05:01.426
Nice digs.
I expected less.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.516
- You got kicked off
another team, didn't ya?

05:07.516 --> 05:12.604
- Yeah, well, ah,
news travels fast, huh?

05:12.604 --> 05:15.315
- It's a small town,
people talk.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.068
You should know that.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.403
I'll get you the key.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.698
Keep your eye out for the cat.
Needs to be fed.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.275
- Come on.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.752
Mrs. Ferguson, I presume.
Hello.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.820
- Whoops.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.990
Breakfast is served.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.367
Come here, ya damned cat.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.598
What did I do to you?

07:26.529 --> 07:28.490
Let's see if this works.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.116
- Go.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.092
- Nothing.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.010
- I don't know what it is.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.264
- Hey, Nicky.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.891
- Abby.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.994
Try that.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.964
- All right.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.177
Thanks.

08:32.887 --> 08:36.516
Yeah, she's a bit of
a stubborn old girl sometimes.

08:59.122 --> 09:02.417
- So that was the long lost
MacAulay brother, eh?

09:02.417 --> 09:07.213
- According to his
birth certificate.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.840
Later?

10:43.643 --> 10:51.693
But there's no way
to matter it at all

10:51.693 --> 10:53.778
- Thanks.

10:53.778 --> 10:57.240
The glasses
that they shine upon,

10:57.240 --> 11:02.120
and on and on.

11:02.120 --> 11:10.003
forever and beyond.

11:10.003 --> 11:14.757
is that you need me

11:19.512 --> 11:26.102
I'm comin' love.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.217
- By the Lord t'undering
Jesus, b'y,

11:58.217 --> 12:01.054
it's the hockey star himself.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.890
Fuck, I can't believe my eyes.
I'm not dreaming, am I?

12:03.890 --> 12:07.352
You, ah,
come for your physical?

12:07.352 --> 12:10.104
- Noah.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.814
- Why, listen, power's back on

12:11.814 --> 12:15.401
in case you want to take
a shower, do some laundry.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.196
Glad you come home, Jordie.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.698
Fuck, it's about damn time.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.495
What? You think I did
all this myself?

12:26.829 --> 12:29.749
Come here, sweetheart.

12:29.749 --> 12:33.461
This stunner is my girl,
Helen Rose. Helen Rose,

12:33.461 --> 12:35.546
meet the most famous
of the MacAulay brothers.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.424
Jordie, he's the, ah,
the middle guy.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.093
- Hi.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.012
- Hey. So what's this?
I leave him alone

12:43.012 --> 12:46.516
for a few years and he starts
talking like a Newfie?

12:46.516 --> 12:50.645
- One of his crew from last
season was from Newfoundland.

12:50.645 --> 12:53.898
- Fishing, Jordie. Not with the
Newfs again this year though,

12:53.898 --> 12:57.068
come, a, setting day
I'll be fishing with Nicky.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.570
On a French guy's boat,
unfortunately.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.656
Jean-Luc LeClair.

13:01.656 --> 13:04.867
- Ya. You gonna start
speaking the French, now?

13:04.867 --> 13:06.494
- As if, smart ass.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.539
- C'est Franglais? Je suis situ?
- All right, all right.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.874
Glad to see you've still
got a little bit

13:11.874 --> 13:16.004
of Mom's beloved Acadie in that
rebel heart of yours, asshole.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.589
I'm working with Dad, for now.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.466
Gotta do something
in the off season

13:20.466 --> 13:23.177
to keep me
out of trouble, right?

13:23.177 --> 13:27.765
Nicky's there too.
Dad's building.

13:27.765 --> 13:31.853
- Yeah, building what?
Hopes and dreams?

13:31.853 --> 13:34.605
- Ah, no,
he's building boats, Jordie.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.525
Lobster boats.
It's custom shit.

13:37.525 --> 13:41.154
Really good shit too.
You should see it.

13:48.119 --> 13:52.915
He's not the same guy, Jordie.
Cut him some slack, all right?

13:59.255 --> 14:02.341
Oh, fuck. Ah,
we're having brunch tomorrow.

14:02.341 --> 14:06.763
Meet every Sunday at Nicky's,
like clockwork. Starts at noon.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.475
So, see you there?

14:12.477 --> 14:14.771
I'll grab this for you.
- Thank you.

14:20.860 --> 14:25.281
- Jordie, longtemps pour voir.

14:25.281 --> 14:29.118
Long time, no see, brother.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.867
- Ah, you've got
to be kidding me.

15:09.867 --> 15:13.371
TV's a little out of date,
Mrs. Ferguson.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.623
And why do you have
so many pillows?

16:53.721 --> 16:56.057
- There'll be rules, Jordie.

16:56.057 --> 17:00.394
- Huh. Oh. Surprise, surprise.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.234
Shoot.

17:07.610 --> 17:10.905
- No booze.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.199
- Not gonna mess up.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.159
- You don't have a choice.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.788
- Or what? Captain.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.417
Come on, tell me.
I want to hear it

17:23.417 --> 17:26.295
from my God-almighty,
better-than-Jesus brother.

17:30.258 --> 17:33.469
- Did you lose
your memory, bro?

17:33.469 --> 17:36.138
- That's funny, cause I, ah,

17:36.138 --> 17:39.475
thought you were a big believer
in second chances.

17:39.475 --> 17:43.646
Working with the old man.
Invite him over for brunch?

17:43.646 --> 17:45.648
Jesus' sake.

17:47.483 --> 17:53.281
- Yah, a big believer.

17:53.281 --> 17:57.868
Helping a coward like you
doesn't make me a believer.

17:57.868 --> 18:01.789
Makes me a sucker.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.382
- Where have you been?

18:11.382 --> 18:13.843
Sam's been waiting all day
for you to come.

18:13.843 --> 18:19.056
- Oh, yeah?
All right, Emma. Let's go.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.648
Whoa.

18:27.648 --> 18:32.028
So, ah, Mrs. Ferguson,
she had a cat, right?

18:32.028 --> 18:34.947
- Big one. Fat.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.991
- Yup. Fluffy.

18:36.991 --> 18:41.829
- And this cat, it's the kind
you can actually touch, right?

18:41.829 --> 18:44.707
- Dad told you the house
was haunted, right?

18:44.707 --> 18:48.252
- Yah. I haven't even seen
the little furball.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.964
- Not little furball.
Big furball.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.592
- All right.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.802
Giv'er.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.721
- Oh shit!

18:58.721 --> 19:03.434
- Sam, you just swore.
Oh shit!

19:03.434 --> 19:05.811
- Well, well.

19:05.811 --> 19:10.816
The Ice Fox and the Ice Fox
in training. Hard at work.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.152
- Yeah, I can, ah,
I can fix that.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.613
- Good.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.615
Hey, Emma.
- Hi.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.367
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.952
- All right, guys,
I think that's it for today.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.663
Another time, 'kay?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.331
- Okay.
- 'Kay

19:25.331 --> 19:27.333
- Don't worry about it.

19:33.005 --> 19:37.885
- Yah, I guess we should
have something to aim at, huh?

19:44.642 --> 19:46.435
Uh, sorry about that.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.814
Sam says you always
let him practice here?

19:49.814 --> 19:53.109
- No, thanks, Mr. MacAulay.
I'm not in need of rescue.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.861
- Aren't you?

19:55.861 --> 19:58.614
She probably knows.
You know that, right?

19:58.614 --> 20:00.616
- Knows what?

20:03.035 --> 20:06.372
- I saw you
come home last night.

20:11.919 --> 20:15.297
- Of course she knows.
She's not blind.

20:15.297 --> 20:20.302
- Right.
Apparently just very obliging.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.597
- I wouldn't know.
That's her business.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.061
- How was the gig last night?

20:29.061 --> 20:33.441
- Should have come.
Then you'd know.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.986
Teammates were all there.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.071
- I thought they had
an away game.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.949
- Illuminating how much you know
about your new team.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.743
- Yeah, well,
I'm not sticking around.

20:44.743 --> 20:48.789
This is just a temporary fix,
that's all.

20:48.789 --> 20:54.670
- Hey, hockey boy.
Meet you out there in 10?

20:56.630 --> 21:00.092
- My window.
- 'Kay, yah.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.803
- Unless you got other plans.

21:02.803 --> 21:05.264
Watering your plants
or something?

21:05.264 --> 21:08.434
- Nope.
- No other plans?

21:08.434 --> 21:12.396
- Nope. No plants.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.912
- Wow.

22:09.912 --> 22:14.458
- Hey! Heart be still,
Hope's salvation has arrived.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.126
- Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.546
- The Ice Fox haven't won
a game in three weeks.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.755
You'd think the town
was in mourning.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.340
- Take it hockey's
not your thing, Noah.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.841
- There are other ways
to entertain oneself

22:22.841 --> 22:23.968
on a cold winter's night.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.094
- Yah, but doesn't
your hand get tired?

22:25.094 --> 22:26.929
- Doesn't have to work
that hard.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.931
- Bring a lunch?
- What?

22:30.558 --> 22:32.351
- Ever work a day job, kid?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.019
- Ever think of minding
your own business?

22:34.019 --> 22:35.062
- That's alright, I'll, uh,

22:35.062 --> 22:36.522
I'll save you my crusts,
okay, Jordie?

22:36.522 --> 22:37.982
Peanut butter
all right with ya?

22:37.982 --> 22:40.067
- Yeah.
- Right.

22:40.067 --> 22:43.445
Wait, let me show you around.
So, ah, so as you can see,

22:43.445 --> 22:46.073
we have the majority
of the work done on it.

22:46.073 --> 22:49.618
We actually mold the exterior
in the warehouse over there

22:49.618 --> 22:51.495
and then we transfer it
back here

22:51.495 --> 22:54.498
to do the finishing
touches on it.

22:54.498 --> 22:58.836
Do somewhere's around
10 boats a year, I'd say.

22:58.836 --> 23:01.213
That's not including
Dad's wooden masterpiece

23:01.213 --> 23:02.548
he's working on.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.674
Pretty rare these days
to actually have

23:03.674 --> 23:05.342
a wood-crafted boat.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.762
But he's been working on it
for a while.

23:14.893 --> 23:20.274
So anyway, keep going on this
way we have the lavatories

23:20.274 --> 23:24.320
in here, I know that's
a big thing for you. Uh...

23:26.196 --> 23:30.367
- All hail the king, boys.
Bow down.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.042
- What, hey.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.634
- Hey, who's the new guy?

24:01.899 --> 24:05.110
- You might live
to see the playoffs.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.821
- God, I hate
this pissant place.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.953
- It's good
to have you back, Jordie.

24:43.107 --> 24:46.485
- Jesus! You scared
the friggin' shit outta me!

24:46.485 --> 24:50.948
- Oh. Sorry,
post-practice practice.

24:50.948 --> 24:54.034
- My heart's in my throat.
Jesus.

24:54.034 --> 24:57.830
- Again, I'm sorry.

24:57.830 --> 25:02.084
You want me on my knees?

25:02.084 --> 25:04.670
- Nicky might.

25:07.589 --> 25:11.844
"Hope's New Hope," huh?

25:11.844 --> 25:15.556
The headline in today's paper?

25:15.556 --> 25:17.725
Do you ever like,
listen to the news

25:17.725 --> 25:20.728
or, I don't know,
read a paper, maybe?

25:23.063 --> 25:25.399
Oh, for God's sake.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.109
- Think Nicky forgot to cancel

25:27.109 --> 25:29.445
old Mrs. Ferguson's
subscription.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.196
Look, I didn't ask
for headlines

25:31.196 --> 25:33.449
in the local gossip rag.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.285
If Nicky's got a problem with
me, he can take it on the ice.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.287
Now if you've got a problem
with me, well then-

25:38.287 --> 25:40.330
- I don't.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.708
I mean, I don't.

25:42.708 --> 25:45.627
- You, you don't know me.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.255
So maybe you should reserve your
judgement there, singer girl.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.050
- Ah, is that really necessary?

25:57.389 --> 26:00.684
- Comin' to the game?

26:00.684 --> 26:04.938
- I gotta play at the club
that night. Gotta set up.

26:04.938 --> 26:11.904
- So leave the game.
Leave it early.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.573
- I remember you
from the Caps, you know.

26:14.573 --> 26:21.622
The old days, junior hockey.
The Western Capitals.

26:21.622 --> 26:25.417
You remember me at all?
From high school?

26:25.417 --> 26:27.294
Not that your
high and mighty ass

26:27.294 --> 26:31.089
ever gave me the time
of day, but, still.

26:31.089 --> 26:36.345
- Yeah, yeah, you, ah, you
hooked up with that, uh, Danny,

26:36.345 --> 26:39.056
Danny, that Derek guy, right?

26:39.056 --> 26:41.141
Hell, I thought you guys woulda

26:41.141 --> 26:43.852
had like a boat load
of rug rats by now.

26:43.852 --> 26:47.314
- Hell, so did I.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.341
- Introducing tonight's
Ice Fox lineup.

27:14.341 --> 27:17.302
Number 22, Mark Morrison.

27:17.302 --> 27:23.141
Number 17, Nicky MacAulay.
Number 21, James Harper.

27:23.141 --> 27:29.231
Number 41, Lewis Maynard.
Number 11, Mark Malcom.

27:29.231 --> 27:34.862
Number Nine, Jordie MacAulay.
And Number 79, Darcy Dell.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.492
Introducing tonight's
Century 21 lineup.

27:40.492 --> 27:44.955
Number Nine, Dodge Stafford.
Number 74, Craig Irving.

27:44.955 --> 27:47.416
Number Four, Scot Richards.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.610
- Woah. Oh no.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.357
- So if you could be any bird

29:35.357 --> 29:36.900
that flew up in the sky,
which one would you be?

29:36.900 --> 29:38.110
- I'd pick eagle.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.238
- I know it's not a bird
but I'd be a Pegasus.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.407
- Your grandfather
would just be a peg.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.909
- Wow.

29:45.909 --> 29:48.245
- Yah, you're funny, Noah.
Peg leg. Get it?

29:48.245 --> 29:50.706
- Exactly.
- Yah, right.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.987
- Nicky, I...

30:21.987 --> 30:25.532
- What?

30:25.532 --> 30:29.327
What?

30:29.327 --> 30:37.127
- No more. Okay? I can't.

30:37.127 --> 30:40.964
I can't any more.

30:40.964 --> 30:44.801
I shouldn't have,
I can't.

30:50.766 --> 30:56.772
- Your family, Nicky.
Your kids.

30:56.772 --> 31:02.903
And I don't know why, how...

31:02.903 --> 31:07.157
Alice. I mean,
Jesus, I live next door.

31:07.157 --> 31:08.867
- My brother.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.911
Jordie is not
the problem here.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.913
- The hell he's not.

31:15.082 --> 31:17.959
There are things
that you don't know, Abby.

31:17.959 --> 31:24.800
- I know lots of things.
I know what it's like to hurt.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.719
I know what it's like
to bury hurt.

31:33.100 --> 31:37.729
No. Don't. Please.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.580
- Forgot to get jam. Damn.

32:37.956 --> 32:41.585
- Hey, brunch, right?

32:41.585 --> 32:44.254
- Sugar. Great.

32:48.175 --> 32:50.051
Jordie, pour some juice,
will you please?

32:50.051 --> 32:52.137
And water.
We need some water.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.935
- Ah.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.696
- That was Charlie,
Abby's kid.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.240
That Dalmatian,
he took it everywhere.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.118
- Not it, Dad, Chippy.

33:15.118 --> 33:18.079
Dad made Chippy here
the team mascot

33:18.079 --> 33:20.749
so Charlie wouldn't
be picked on anymore.

33:20.749 --> 33:24.211
- He sucked at hockey.

33:24.211 --> 33:27.505
- Nicky, you coached
Sam's hockey team?

33:27.505 --> 33:30.091
- Until the parents
tossed him.

33:30.091 --> 33:34.721
Kids apparently learn better
from coaches who actually speak.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.432
- Ah Jesus, ah damn.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.517
- Nicky, please.

33:39.517 --> 33:42.979
- I watched out for Charlie.
He was my friend.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.690
- Charlie was Sam's best friend.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.151
- They were like brothers.

33:53.323 --> 33:55.033
- For God's sake, Nicky,

33:55.033 --> 33:56.910
don't you have headphones
for that thing?

34:01.915 --> 34:04.000
- Excuse me.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.629
- Whoowee. Game day, baby!

34:07.629 --> 34:10.131
MacAulay brothers sailing down
the ice together again.

34:10.131 --> 34:12.926
Can life get any better? Huh?

34:12.926 --> 34:15.178
- Sit, eat, before it gets cold.

34:18.139 --> 34:21.184
- What is up with our uncle?

34:30.860 --> 34:32.862
- Thanks, man.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.451
- Wow, this looks amazing.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.456
- How's that one look?

34:43.456 --> 34:45.125
- Nice, thank you.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.294
- No buying fans.

34:47.294 --> 34:52.340
- Sorry. I'm Daddy's fan.
I'm cheering for Daddy.

34:55.969 --> 34:57.762
- What's so funny?

34:57.762 --> 35:01.433
- You're adorable.
- I like my Dad, he's awesome.

35:03.310 --> 35:06.563
- Toast, anybody?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.421
- How's your day going, son?

35:31.421 --> 35:33.423
- All right.

36:13.254 --> 36:16.674
- Hey, we were
just finishing up.

36:16.674 --> 36:19.678
- It's fine.
Continue.

36:23.056 --> 36:27.894
- Sam broke his stick.
Nicky's going to kill me.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.521
- Yup.

36:33.149 --> 36:41.533
- Hey, uh, your son, Charlie,
he, uh, he played hockey?

36:44.702 --> 36:47.705
Look, I, I don't have to
bring the kids over here,

36:47.705 --> 36:51.543
we can go find another spot
to go slam pucks around.

36:53.002 --> 36:56.840
- Where you gonna hide
the rest of the kids, Jordie?

37:07.725 --> 37:09.602
Let me try this.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.688
- Aaah. Be careful with that.

37:15.066 --> 37:18.319
- Uh!
-

37:18.319 --> 37:20.697
Uh, you're going
to break my stick.

37:39.466 --> 37:45.096
It was court ordered ...

37:45.096 --> 37:49.934
Charlie going to his dad's
the weekend ...

37:49.934 --> 37:53.521
the weekend of the accident.

37:53.521 --> 37:56.065
Custody agreement.

37:56.065 --> 37:58.818
I just thought I'd, I'd send
him like Derek wanted,

37:58.818 --> 38:00.987
and I don't know,
go out at night,

38:00.987 --> 38:03.781
maybe see a movie,
clean the house the next day,

38:03.781 --> 38:06.117
just, you know,
do my own shit for once.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.829
Maybe write a new song.

38:09.829 --> 38:13.750
And then I'd get Charlie
all the next week

38:13.750 --> 38:17.879
and the following weekend,
and then ...

38:17.879 --> 38:19.756
just a little short term
missing him

38:19.756 --> 38:23.384
for some long term peace
with his dad, you know?

38:41.736 --> 38:46.115
I didn't get that peace.

38:46.115 --> 38:49.202
I'll never get that peace.

38:49.202 --> 38:51.454
Hell, some days,

38:51.454 --> 38:53.998
I'm glad I remember
how to tie my shoelaces.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.679
- I'm really sorry, Abby.

39:13.601 --> 39:15.895
You ever just
think about leaving?

39:19.566 --> 39:22.569
- Leaving here'd
be like leaving him.

39:56.060 --> 40:02.150
- Ghosts don't eat.
They don't shit. Right?

40:14.412 --> 40:16.122
- Hi, son.

40:16.122 --> 40:19.626
- So are noodles on sale? How
could we miss that one, Pop?

40:19.626 --> 40:21.294
- That's a good one, Noah.

40:21.294 --> 40:24.505
It's hilarious.
I'm just here for cat food.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.966
- Better get the weight loss
kind. Cat's huge.

40:26.966 --> 40:31.137
- Is he? Huh.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.892
- See ya.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.275
Ah, Jesus.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.991
- Pop, I got the cane,
I got the cane.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.327
I got the cane.
Just get in the car.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.120
- All right.
- In the car.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.997
There you go?
Got your foot in?

40:57.997 --> 40:59.999
- Got it.

41:24.982 --> 41:28.194
You curious about that?

41:28.194 --> 41:30.905
- Nah, I could care less.

41:30.905 --> 41:34.992
- About the cane.
The gimp leg.

41:34.992 --> 41:37.745
Got a taste
of his own medicine.

41:37.745 --> 41:41.958
Courtesy of Mom's brother,
Uncle Alfred.

41:41.958 --> 41:45.503
Right after the funeral.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.965
Nicky found him.

41:48.965 --> 41:52.093
Outside his car,
frozen to snow,

41:52.093 --> 41:55.304
for the blood, you know?

41:55.304 --> 41:59.225
- Nicky, always the hero.

41:59.225 --> 42:02.228
- Thank fucking God.

42:02.228 --> 42:06.149
Thank fucking God.

42:06.149 --> 42:09.861
- Just can't get used
to seeing him sober.

42:09.861 --> 42:15.366
- Well, he's been sober
ever since Mom die-

42:15.366 --> 42:18.703
ever since, you know.

42:18.703 --> 42:23.166
- Give the guy a fuckin' medal.

42:25.001 --> 42:27.170
How the hell
you'd end up so normal?

42:27.170 --> 42:31.048
- Normal?

42:31.048 --> 42:33.259
I don't think I'm normal.

42:33.259 --> 42:40.308
But, ah,
if I had to guess ... Mom.

42:43.519 --> 42:45.438
Don't you remember
all the bedtime stories

42:45.438 --> 42:47.106
she used to tell us?

42:47.106 --> 42:51.444
Unfiltered MacAulay version
of fairy tales.

42:51.444 --> 42:53.446
Talked about giant
gingerbread houses

42:53.446 --> 42:55.656
and fat little plump toddlers

42:55.656 --> 42:57.825
eatin' doorknob gumdrops
or some shit.

42:57.825 --> 43:02.288
What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

43:02.288 --> 43:06.751
- Mom's stories made a hell
of a lot more sense to me.

43:06.751 --> 43:09.712
We were barely out of preschool
and she's telling us,

43:09.712 --> 43:13.633
"All booze is gonna get you,
boys, is a lonely life,

43:13.633 --> 43:15.635
or an early grave."

43:16.552 --> 43:22.225
But, hey, I doubt she figured
the early grave would be hers.

43:25.353 --> 43:30.483
Let's do dinner, bud.
Hey? Just us boys.

43:30.483 --> 43:32.777
We'll have a steak,
skip the beer.

43:32.777 --> 43:36.405
Hell, I'll even lower myself
to your level and talk hockey.

43:36.405 --> 43:40.201
You and Nicky,

43:40.201 --> 43:43.412
you guys used to live out of
each other's pockets, you know?

43:43.412 --> 43:46.457
I miss that old MacAulay magic.

43:49.752 --> 43:52.588
Do it, bud.

43:52.588 --> 43:57.468
Hey, look who came through.
- Beauty.

43:57.468 --> 44:00.513
- Aren't you full of surprises.
- It's what we needed.

44:00.513 --> 44:02.890
- Get your fix.
- Black?

44:02.890 --> 44:06.060
- Which is the one
with two sugars? That one?

44:06.060 --> 44:08.437
- Thanks, bro.
- Thanks, Nicky.

44:08.437 --> 44:13.359
- Yah.
- We should...

44:20.366 --> 44:25.162
- We're figuring things out,
you know. Me and Nicky.

44:25.162 --> 44:26.831
- My book, figuring out

44:26.831 --> 44:30.334
usually has something
to do with talking.

44:30.334 --> 44:33.629
- We talk.

44:33.629 --> 44:38.634
- Yeah? Same way
you and Dad used to, right?

44:54.483 --> 44:56.819
- I didn't raise my kids.
- Oh, please.

44:56.819 --> 45:00.448
- Look at this guy, here.
- Alrighty.

45:00.448 --> 45:02.408
- Hey, look who's here.

45:02.408 --> 45:04.952
Got your favorite spot,
right by the window.

45:04.952 --> 45:08.915
Fancy placemats we got here
with all the advertisements.

45:08.915 --> 45:13.502
Breaking down the front page
of the New York Times or...

45:34.482 --> 45:36.817
- Beers to start, fellas?

45:36.817 --> 45:39.362
- Yeah, whatever's on tap.

45:39.362 --> 45:42.990
- I-I'll have water.
- Same here,

45:42.990 --> 45:44.784
- Yeah, same.

45:44.784 --> 45:46.869
- Need some menus
for the meals, boys?

45:46.869 --> 45:50.247
- Nope. I'm having me a steak.
- How do you like it?

45:50.247 --> 45:53.793
- Just tear me off a hunk
of flesh as it runs by.

45:53.793 --> 45:56.462
Bloody, thanks.

45:56.462 --> 45:59.548
- That'd be rare.
Baked or mashed?

45:59.548 --> 46:01.342
- Thank you for enlightening me.

46:01.342 --> 46:06.138
Rare it is.
Baked with extra melted butter.

46:06.138 --> 46:08.724
That's well-done butter.

46:08.724 --> 46:11.727
I'm kidding, lighten up
a little bit. Jesus Christ.

46:11.727 --> 46:14.897
Pile on the fried onions too,
if you don't mind.

46:14.897 --> 46:16.983
Actually might as well
make that four steaks,

46:16.983 --> 46:19.068
all of them rare,
am I right, boys?

46:19.068 --> 46:20.236
- Yeah.

46:20.236 --> 46:21.946
- All right.
- All baked?

46:21.946 --> 46:25.491
- Well it depends on how
you look at it, sweetheart.

46:25.491 --> 46:27.743
It, anyone, wanna?

46:27.743 --> 46:30.329
- Ya.
- Sure. Thank you.

46:30.329 --> 46:32.415
- Medium rare
on the steak for me.

46:32.415 --> 46:35.292
- Light weight.
- Same here.

46:35.292 --> 46:39.422
- Jordie?
You don't remember me.

46:39.422 --> 46:43.467
Colleen. I used to give you
my notes in biology.

46:43.467 --> 46:46.721
- Hmm. Bet you did.
That all you gave him?

46:46.721 --> 46:49.557
- Noah.

46:49.557 --> 46:51.642
- The night you boys
won the Nationals,

46:51.642 --> 46:55.688
you and me under the stars
at the Cape Egmont lighthouse?

46:55.688 --> 46:58.149
You back here now?

46:58.149 --> 47:00.234
- Yah, just for a bit.

47:00.234 --> 47:03.487
- With your family?
- No. No family.

47:03.487 --> 47:07.658
- Ouch, bro.
- I meant no wife or kids.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.952
No ball and chain.

47:09.952 --> 47:14.290
- Well I get off at ten.

47:14.290 --> 47:17.418
- Huh, what the fuck was that?

47:17.418 --> 47:21.672
- So, how's Helen Rose doing?

47:21.672 --> 47:24.216
- Well, it's like this, Pop,

47:24.216 --> 47:26.510
I made two runs today
for hot fudge milkshakes,

47:26.510 --> 47:28.304
and one for dill pickle chips.

47:28.304 --> 47:29.889
She made fried rice
for dinner last night

47:29.889 --> 47:31.307
for the third time in a row.

47:31.307 --> 47:33.559
She's chain-smoking little
chick flicks to the point

47:33.559 --> 47:35.603
where I'm starting to develop
a fuckin' lisp.

47:35.603 --> 47:39.899
She's doing good. Me, I need
a little bit of man talk,

47:39.899 --> 47:45.988
which is why you boys are here.

47:45.988 --> 47:48.949
It's-it's going well.
We're, ah, we're mostly ready.

47:48.949 --> 47:51.827
All that we need to do
is put together the crib.

47:51.827 --> 47:55.623
And, uh, turns out I'll have
some extra time to do that.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.291
- What do you mean?

47:57.291 --> 47:58.793
- Well she doesn't want
me fishing.

47:58.793 --> 48:02.755
She's uh, she's freaking out
over this kid, she's worried

48:02.755 --> 48:05.091
that she'll deliver
when I'm out on the water.

48:05.091 --> 48:07.885
No sunrise starts to my day.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.762
- Huh.

48:09.762 --> 48:15.101
- But that puts
LeClair down a guy.

48:15.101 --> 48:18.521
- No. No way.

48:18.521 --> 48:20.481
- Yeah, way.
Why the hell not?

48:20.481 --> 48:22.191
- You have a job.

48:22.191 --> 48:24.610
- Yeah but,
lobster fishing I'll make

48:24.610 --> 48:25.945
a hell of a lot more,
right, Nicky?

48:25.945 --> 48:27.279
- Well, find your own boat,
get your own dinghy.

48:27.279 --> 48:28.781
- It's not your boat,
it's LeClair's.

48:28.781 --> 48:31.659
- The town's counting on you,
son, they want the win.

48:31.659 --> 48:34.370
- But hockey? Jesus, Dad.
It's practically a beer league.

48:34.370 --> 48:37.206
Half the players
don't even show up.

48:37.206 --> 48:38.791
As far as work
at the shop goes, I mean,

48:38.791 --> 48:40.292
you've got Noah for help,
and there's plenty

48:40.292 --> 48:42.211
of guys back from the oil patch
that need work.

48:42.211 --> 48:44.964
Me and Nicky will be back
before you know it.

48:44.964 --> 48:47.091
And I could
really use the money.

48:47.091 --> 48:50.719
Lobster boat fishing?
I could eventually

48:50.719 --> 48:53.305
get a mortgage
and buy the Ferguson house.

48:53.305 --> 48:55.516
I could even make it an annual
thing like Nicky does.

48:55.516 --> 48:57.226
You think LeClair
would have me?

48:57.226 --> 48:59.478
- Yeah.
- He doesn't even know him.

48:59.478 --> 49:03.941
- He'll have him.
He's a fan of yours. Hockey.

49:06.569 --> 49:08.195
- Thank God.

49:11.031 --> 49:15.369
- Yeah, speaking of hockey,
Sam broke his stick.

49:15.369 --> 49:18.622
You might want to get him?
- I'll get him a stick.

49:18.622 --> 49:21.750
- Will you? You don't even know
if he shoots left or right.

49:21.750 --> 49:23.836
- What was I thinking?
Man talk. No.

49:23.836 --> 49:26.839
Nicholas Sparks
for you, Noah. Fuck you.

49:26.839 --> 49:28.257
- Hell, Nicky,
when was the last time you

49:28.257 --> 49:29.758
even picked up a stick
with Sam and Emma?

49:29.758 --> 49:31.760
- I'm too busy to play games.
- Liar, that's all you do.

49:31.760 --> 49:33.470
- You know, I don't have time
for your bullshit.

49:33.470 --> 49:36.223
- Yeah. You're too busy
playing with your own stick.

49:36.223 --> 49:39.310
- I'll show you what I can do
with my goddamn stick!

49:39.310 --> 49:40.936
- Sit down!

49:44.023 --> 49:47.318
Christ, you got to air
everything out in public?

49:47.318 --> 49:49.862
I'm going to take a leak.

49:49.862 --> 49:53.908
Oh for God's sake,
give me a hand, will ya?

49:56.410 --> 49:58.746
- Okay. Figure it out.

50:08.005 --> 50:12.176
- You know why he lost it
that night? The night Mom died?

50:12.176 --> 50:16.305
Yeah, our good ol' Dad here.

50:16.305 --> 50:19.850
She made the wrong cookies.
He wanted peanut butter,

50:19.850 --> 50:22.353
she made chocolate chip for you.

50:22.353 --> 50:29.985
Always you. Everybody's fucking
favorite, right? Always.

50:29.985 --> 50:31.987
- Fuck this.

51:06.021 --> 51:08.023
- Jordie?

51:10.943 --> 51:15.990
- Do you ever think you'll be
able to forgive Charlie's Dad?

51:15.990 --> 51:24.957
- What? Oh.
I mean, yah, I'm trying to.

51:26.750 --> 51:28.752
- And yourself?

51:32.923 --> 51:34.925
- I'm trying to.

51:40.014 --> 51:43.517
How was dinner?

51:43.517 --> 51:49.189
- Oh, great.
Usual MacAulay magic.

52:01.785 --> 52:03.912
Tell me what
you're thinking

52:03.912 --> 52:09.168
through my mind.

52:09.168 --> 52:11.128
you're thinking

52:11.128 --> 52:16.383
through my mind.

52:16.383 --> 52:18.385
you're thinking

52:18.385 --> 52:22.264
through my mind.

52:22.264 --> 52:29.063
panorama high.

55:08.639 --> 55:12.226
- Let him go.

55:12.226 --> 55:18.690
Abby, once and for all,
just, just let him go.

56:08.991 --> 56:10.617
- Nicky!

56:31.722 --> 56:34.391
- I think you should take
a little break, Nicky!

56:34.391 --> 56:36.560
Sit out the next three games.

56:54.661 --> 56:57.414
- Does it hurt?

56:57.414 --> 57:02.794
- No, it's fine.

57:02.794 --> 57:04.504
- So, playoffs, huh?

57:04.504 --> 57:07.174
- Yah, yah.

57:07.174 --> 57:08.884
- Thanks to you.

57:08.884 --> 57:13.430
Thanks to the team.

57:13.430 --> 57:16.433
Maybe not Nicky so much.

57:20.604 --> 57:23.440
- How was your rehearsal
this morning?

57:23.440 --> 57:27.152
- Fine.

57:27.152 --> 57:30.656
- Ever think about doing
something with your music?

57:30.656 --> 57:36.536
I mean, you sing, you write.
It's, it's mesmerizing.

57:36.536 --> 57:39.247
- That's a pretty big word
for a hockey player.

57:39.247 --> 57:44.419
- Yeah, it is. Might even
be as big as song-writing.

57:44.419 --> 57:50.801
Let me count, um,
one, two, three, four, five-

57:50.801 --> 57:53.720
- They're the same length,
hockey boy.

57:53.720 --> 57:58.350
- Right.

57:58.350 --> 58:00.936
- I have other things
on my mind right now.

58:04.272 --> 58:09.152
- Yeah. Forever?

58:09.152 --> 58:13.615
- At what point do you suggest
I forget I had a son?

58:13.615 --> 58:22.666
- I, I didn't, um,
I didn't mean that.

58:22.666 --> 58:28.338
It's just, you need
to move on with your life.

58:28.338 --> 58:30.340
- I am moving on.

58:52.112 --> 58:58.076
You know what? Fine.
Your turn. You move on.

58:58.076 --> 59:01.246
Start by helping
your brother, Jordie.

59:05.584 --> 59:07.586
- Nicky.

59:09.755 --> 59:16.261
- Jordie,
I'm scared for him.

59:16.261 --> 59:20.849
- Do you know that me and Nicky,
we played on the only team

59:20.849 --> 59:25.437
from here
that ever won the Nationals?

59:25.437 --> 59:30.859
Memorial Cup.
Me and Nicky.

59:30.859 --> 59:34.613
- I know a lot of things
about you and Nicky.

59:34.613 --> 59:38.283
You'd be surprised what I know
about you and Nicky.

59:43.371 --> 59:46.124
- You're breaking his heart.

1:00:02.808 --> 1:00:06.228
Yeah, I've never seen
the damn thing.

1:00:06.228 --> 1:00:09.147
It's a freakin' ghost.

1:00:16.154 --> 1:00:18.573
- Hey, mornin', sunshine.

1:00:22.536 --> 1:00:24.621
- Mornin'.

1:00:24.621 --> 1:00:29.167
Yeah, so, uh,
'bout this fishing gig.

1:00:29.167 --> 1:00:34.256
Sounded great in theory but,
uh, 4:30 in the morning?

1:00:34.256 --> 1:00:35.924
I don't know why anyone

1:00:35.924 --> 1:00:38.343
would want to get up
for that, like ever.

1:00:38.343 --> 1:00:42.264
- Sunrises, Jordie.
You ever see one?

1:00:42.264 --> 1:00:46.142
They come from that big
orange blob in the sky.

1:00:46.142 --> 1:00:47.894
- Not a fan of sunrises.

1:00:47.894 --> 1:00:50.522
They come far too early
in the morning for me.

1:00:50.522 --> 1:00:55.485
- I don't know, fresh air, spray
of the salty sea in your face.

1:00:55.485 --> 1:00:58.738
Freedom of the open seas,
arrr.

1:00:58.738 --> 1:01:01.825
Listen, you signed on
for this gig, all right?

1:01:01.825 --> 1:01:05.161
LeClair know
you haven't fished in years?

1:01:06.997 --> 1:01:09.791
Those lobster dinghys roll,
remember, boy?

1:01:09.791 --> 1:01:11.877
Worse, you are gonna stink,

1:01:11.877 --> 1:01:14.546
worse than a cab driver
during a heat wave.

1:01:14.546 --> 1:01:16.256
We're talking
about fish guts here,

1:01:16.256 --> 1:01:17.924
you know what I'm saying?

1:01:17.924 --> 1:01:22.053
You don't lose that shit,
clings to you like death.

1:01:22.053 --> 1:01:23.680
- Yeah, Noah, I know.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:25.432
I know what I got myself into.
- Yeah?

1:01:25.432 --> 1:01:29.477
- Fishing got me
my first truck in high school.

1:01:32.522 --> 1:01:35.400
- Shoulda kept on fishing.

1:01:38.069 --> 1:01:41.364
Jordie. Hold up, Jordie.

1:01:42.824 --> 1:01:45.160
Got something for you.

1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:48.538
- What's up?
- Noah.

1:01:48.538 --> 1:01:50.248
- What's this?

1:01:50.248 --> 1:01:53.376
- It's a brand new hockey stick,
what does it look like?

1:01:53.376 --> 1:01:55.003
- Oh, great, for playoffs.

1:01:55.003 --> 1:01:56.338
It's good 'cause I need
a new hockey stick,

1:01:56.338 --> 1:01:58.006
but, uh, looks a little small.

1:01:58.006 --> 1:01:59.674
- Eh, perfect size for you.

1:01:59.674 --> 1:02:01.468
Why don't you open it up,
twinkle toes?

1:02:01.468 --> 1:02:03.470
Yah, me and Pop have been
working on it when you,

1:02:03.470 --> 1:02:05.096
ah, been out on the ice.

1:02:05.096 --> 1:02:08.558
Figure it will
come in handy for ya.

1:02:08.558 --> 1:02:10.685
- Yeah, read the inscription.

1:02:12.771 --> 1:02:17.108
- Draw me not without reason.
Sheath me not without honor.

1:02:17.108 --> 1:02:19.986
- You, uh, wrap it around
your waist when you're fishing.

1:02:19.986 --> 1:02:22.656
Keeps the bejesus north wind
from blowing down your oilskins

1:02:22.656 --> 1:02:25.033
freezing off your little
mushroom pecker.

1:02:25.033 --> 1:02:28.995
- Great 'cause might actually
need that again some day.

1:02:28.995 --> 1:02:31.373
- Yah, I get off in ten minutes.

1:02:31.373 --> 1:02:32.791
Hey, I'm so sorry.

1:02:32.791 --> 1:02:37.003
Hey, try the apple
before you use that on me, okay?

1:02:37.003 --> 1:02:39.631
It's a little sharp, be careful.
- Yah, she's sharp.

1:02:54.521 --> 1:02:58.274
- There. Done. Finally.

1:02:58.274 --> 1:03:01.528
- Did you get yours done
okay, Emma?

1:03:03.863 --> 1:03:09.452
- Mom, why is Daddy's truck
parked in Abby's driveway?

1:03:23.008 --> 1:03:25.010
Mom?

1:03:41.609 --> 1:03:47.115
I am blue
healing water, rain

1:03:47.115 --> 1:03:52.370
I am sky on cloudless day

1:03:52.370 --> 1:03:57.625
I am eyes searching

1:03:57.625 --> 1:04:01.087
and endless blue

1:04:01.087 --> 1:04:08.344
- No. Not you. Not you!

1:04:08.344 --> 1:04:10.930
Have you heard
the words I'm saying

1:04:10.930 --> 1:04:13.308
to your heart

1:04:13.308 --> 1:04:16.102
within the stillness

1:04:18.813 --> 1:04:23.777
oh mother of light

1:04:23.777 --> 1:04:26.446
that there is nothing

1:04:26.446 --> 1:04:34.120
in sight.

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:39.292
I am anger justified

1:04:39.292 --> 1:04:44.672
I am roses still outside

1:04:44.672 --> 1:04:50.095
I am red wine

1:04:50.095 --> 1:04:53.348
fiery song of lust...

1:04:53.348 --> 1:04:56.935
- Come on, Easter Bunny,
where are you?

1:04:56.935 --> 1:04:59.813
I'm still waiting.

1:04:59.813 --> 1:05:02.315
Can't just sit here
all night, you know.

1:05:15.036 --> 1:05:17.497
- Daddy, if the Easter Bunny
had a boat,

1:05:17.497 --> 1:05:19.707
I think it would be purple.

1:05:55.827 --> 1:05:58.705
Yup, purple.

1:05:58.705 --> 1:06:02.333
With gold and silver sparkles.

1:06:11.217 --> 1:06:15.513
Daddy, do you think
it would have sparkles?

1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:25.273
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Easter Bunny.

1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:48.880
- Great.
- That'll do 'er boys.

1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:50.757
Have a good game.
- 'Kay, yah.

1:06:50.757 --> 1:06:53.885
- Not too good though, got an
early start in the morning.

1:06:53.885 --> 1:06:55.887
- Right.

1:07:39.722 --> 1:07:41.516
- You seen Nicky?

1:07:41.516 --> 1:07:44.894
- Yah, we loaded a boat full
of traps earlier this morning.

1:07:44.894 --> 1:07:49.983
He's probably just resting up.
He'll be here.

1:07:49.983 --> 1:07:52.986
- You can always
count on Nicky.

1:07:52.986 --> 1:07:54.988
- Yeah.

1:08:02.078 --> 1:08:06.082
- You forget the way, MacAuley?
- You gotta be kidding me.

1:08:06.082 --> 1:08:09.085
- Nicky, you're late,
get suited up.

1:08:21.180 --> 1:08:26.561
- It's just nerves, man.
A lot riding on this game.

1:08:26.561 --> 1:08:29.480
- This ain't the NHL, Jordie.

1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:35.862
You said it yourself,
it's some beer league.

1:10:05.535 --> 1:10:09.414
- All right, you animals.
You want to lose this game?

1:10:09.414 --> 1:10:14.961
We're two periods
away from playoffs.

1:10:45.992 --> 1:10:50.288
- Fuck, Nicky.
What the hell's your problem?

1:10:50.288 --> 1:10:51.873
- You fucking hot shot,
I'm sick of you.

1:10:51.873 --> 1:10:53.875
- You're out
of your fuckin' mind.

1:10:53.875 --> 1:10:56.252
- I'm outta my mind?
I'm outta my mind?

1:10:56.252 --> 1:10:58.337
- What do you want
from me, man?

1:10:58.337 --> 1:11:01.007
- I think you know,
'kay, you know.

1:11:01.007 --> 1:11:02.842
- I didn't kill Mom.

1:11:02.842 --> 1:11:05.178
It's not my fault.
I was just a kid.

1:11:05.178 --> 1:11:09.348
- I was there,
Jordie. I was there.

1:12:22.838 --> 1:12:25.716
- You want to know
what problems I have with ya?

1:12:29.220 --> 1:12:33.224
'Cause I got a lot
a problems with ya.

1:12:33.224 --> 1:12:35.434
I had your back.

1:12:35.434 --> 1:12:38.396
I woulda helped ya!

1:12:38.396 --> 1:12:45.486
But you left us.
Me. And Noah. You left me!

1:12:49.824 --> 1:12:55.746
I had to do it all.
Our Dad. Noah.

1:13:00.209 --> 1:13:03.045
The blood.

1:13:03.045 --> 1:13:07.633
Then you come back
and you shit on me.

1:13:07.633 --> 1:13:10.344
They spit on him, you know.

1:13:10.344 --> 1:13:14.932
They smashed his knee
with a fuckin' baseball bat.

1:13:14.932 --> 1:13:18.269
Once a drunk,
always a drunk. Right?

1:13:18.269 --> 1:13:23.024
Once a wife killer,
always a wife killer.

1:13:23.024 --> 1:13:26.193
Even though they were wrong.

1:13:26.193 --> 1:13:27.903
Even though
they were wrong.

1:13:27.903 --> 1:13:29.697
It was your fault Mom died!

1:13:29.697 --> 1:13:31.699
- Nicky!
- Jesus!

1:13:31.699 --> 1:13:36.245
- Get outta here.
Go back to your kids.

1:14:23.084 --> 1:14:27.338
- Don't. Just go.

1:14:27.338 --> 1:14:29.340
Just go.

1:14:32.635 --> 1:14:36.972
- Your mother?

1:14:36.972 --> 1:14:43.062
- My dad, fucking martyr?

1:14:43.062 --> 1:14:48.442
He used to drag her,
and us around by the hair.

1:14:48.442 --> 1:14:50.152
Dunk our heads into toilets

1:14:50.152 --> 1:14:52.530
before we were
old enough to even talk.

1:14:52.530 --> 1:14:56.158
And now he's a fucking martyr?

1:15:04.417 --> 1:15:08.295
He went after her one night.

1:15:08.295 --> 1:15:13.300
So I got in the middle.

1:15:13.300 --> 1:15:18.097
And he came after me.

1:15:18.097 --> 1:15:26.480
So I, uh, and she...

1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:28.399
- It was an accident.

1:15:28.399 --> 1:15:36.657
- You think
any of that matters?

1:15:36.657 --> 1:15:46.167
Nothing. Nothing,
since the night my mom died,

1:15:46.167 --> 1:15:49.587
nothing's mattered.

1:16:29.877 --> 1:16:37.635
- Honor. You know what would
have been honorable?

1:16:37.635 --> 1:16:43.808
Flying out west to see me play,
that woulda been honorable.

1:16:43.808 --> 1:16:49.313
Or, hell, you coulda sent me a
fuckin' birthday card just once.

1:16:49.313 --> 1:16:51.315
Just once.

1:16:54.777 --> 1:16:58.405
Mom woulda liked that.

1:16:58.405 --> 1:17:02.159
I know you're sorry.

1:17:02.159 --> 1:17:07.581
You know how I know?

1:17:07.581 --> 1:17:11.085
Because you loved her too ...

1:17:16.674 --> 1:17:19.677
Mom.

1:17:25.057 --> 1:17:32.106
Despite it all,
you loved her too.

1:17:59.091 --> 1:18:04.889
When I was a boy,
I had everything

1:18:10.603 --> 1:18:15.065
with the cowboys

1:18:45.304 --> 1:18:53.103
take me back

1:18:57.066 --> 1:19:04.365
anymore

1:19:37.272 --> 1:19:42.987
was my country

1:19:42.987 --> 1:19:47.658
were my den

1:19:47.658 --> 1:19:54.289
a thousand ships

1:19:59.837 --> 1:20:05.259
when did I grow old

1:20:05.259 --> 1:20:10.180
where can I go...

1:20:16.812 --> 1:20:20.524
- Hey. Don't kick the rope,
it's going to tangle.

1:20:48.886 --> 1:20:51.597
- How's your brother doin'?

1:21:08.238 --> 1:21:13.786
- Uh!

1:21:16.205 --> 1:21:17.831
- LeClair!

1:21:30.552 --> 1:21:32.971
- Pull!

1:21:35.599 --> 1:21:37.726
- Jordie.
- Nicky.

1:21:37.726 --> 1:21:40.813
- Jordie.
- Give me the knife.

1:21:40.813 --> 1:21:44.149
- Hang on.

1:21:46.193 --> 1:21:47.986
- Okay.
- I got it.

1:22:04.419 --> 1:22:08.173
- Jordie!

1:22:46.003 --> 1:22:48.005
- Get up! Get up! Get up!

1:22:48.005 --> 1:22:50.382
- Get me a knife.
Get me a knife!

1:22:51.758 --> 1:22:54.428
Hang on, Jordie. Jordie!

1:23:03.353 --> 1:23:05.814
- Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

1:23:08.775 --> 1:23:11.945
Give me your hand.

1:23:20.787 --> 1:23:23.957
What colour is
a heartache,

1:23:23.957 --> 1:23:26.043
- Where do you think
that's going?

1:23:30.672 --> 1:23:36.261
never fades

1:23:41.475 --> 1:23:45.646
is the light of day

1:23:45.646 --> 1:23:51.068
of mine survey?

1:24:12.005 --> 1:24:21.098
to never lie at peace?

1:24:25.644 --> 1:24:31.817
sweet release?

1:24:31.817 --> 1:24:37.114
at my door,

1:24:37.114 --> 1:24:42.744
forever more?

1:24:42.744 --> 1:24:47.332
Atlantic Blue?

1:25:02.764 --> 1:25:12.065
as waves wash on the sand,

1:25:15.193 --> 1:25:21.867
of his children in my hands.

1:25:21.867 --> 1:25:26.413
will receive no answer?

1:25:26.413 --> 1:25:32.502
upon the wind?

1:25:32.502 --> 1:25:36.423
so familiar,

1:25:36.423 --> 1:25:42.596
as the night comes in?

1:25:42.596 --> 1:25:47.934
never fails to find.

1:25:47.934 --> 1:25:50.020
- I left the key
in the kitchen.

1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:52.272
- No, you don't get to go.

1:25:52.272 --> 1:25:56.360
You don't get to leave.
Where ya gonna go? Huh?

1:25:56.360 --> 1:25:59.529
Where ya gonna run to,
ya little runt? Huh?

1:25:59.529 --> 1:26:02.407
- Why, Alice? Why do you care
all of a sudden?

1:26:02.407 --> 1:26:04.117
Why do you give
a sweet shit about me now?

1:26:04.117 --> 1:26:06.078
- I don't.
I don't care about you.

1:26:06.078 --> 1:26:07.871
- Alice, I don't want
to be here anymore.

1:26:07.871 --> 1:26:11.083
I hate this goddamn place.

1:26:21.009 --> 1:26:28.433
I've got no place.
No place I belong.

1:26:28.433 --> 1:26:32.437
I've got nothing.

1:26:34.481 --> 1:26:36.858
- This whole town
has grown to love you.

1:26:36.858 --> 1:26:40.612
You ever figure out why?

1:26:40.612 --> 1:26:42.697
- Because I chase
some stupid rubber puck

1:26:42.697 --> 1:26:44.366
around some frozen water.

1:26:44.366 --> 1:26:48.745
- No! Because you give them
something to believe in.

1:26:48.745 --> 1:26:52.416
- It's just a game.

1:26:52.416 --> 1:26:57.045
I'm ... it's nothing.

1:27:06.138 --> 1:27:11.101
Don't forget to feed
that goddamn cat.

1:28:43.276 --> 1:28:51.910
Hockey rinks ...
are like Catholic churches,

1:28:51.910 --> 1:28:55.247
pretty much the same
wherever you land.

1:29:07.759 --> 1:29:09.761
- This place.

1:29:16.184 --> 1:29:18.186
This place.

1:29:20.230 --> 1:29:24.901
We knew this place
better than anyone.

1:29:24.901 --> 1:29:29.114
On the ice.
In the stands.

1:29:33.660 --> 1:29:35.662
It was ours.

1:29:40.250 --> 1:29:45.797
We'd even
watch figure skating.

1:29:45.797 --> 1:29:48.967
Eating red licorice.

1:29:48.967 --> 1:29:52.971
And those box caramel toffees.

1:29:59.185 --> 1:30:02.188
Oh, this place.

1:30:06.568 --> 1:30:12.907
This was our place.

1:30:12.907 --> 1:30:18.204
Our place to hide from him.

1:30:18.204 --> 1:30:23.877
He'd come lookin' for us.

1:30:23.877 --> 1:30:29.090
Always drunk.

1:30:29.090 --> 1:30:35.096
Always mad.

1:30:35.096 --> 1:30:38.391
We weren't on this ice.

1:30:38.391 --> 1:30:41.770
We'd hide.

1:30:41.770 --> 1:30:46.524
You and me.

1:30:46.524 --> 1:30:49.527
In the penalty box.

1:30:53.406 --> 1:30:56.743
Or hunkered
in those stands playin',

1:30:56.743 --> 1:31:03.041
playin' musketeers.

1:31:03.041 --> 1:31:06.294
We were invincible and free.

1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:23.812
We wouldn't go home until Mom
sent Noah out to look for us.

1:31:23.812 --> 1:31:26.815
Until it was safe.

1:31:32.195 --> 1:31:38.034
Safe for us to go home, Jordie.

1:31:38.034 --> 1:31:40.745
He still needs us, you know.

1:31:40.745 --> 1:31:45.208
Noah.

1:31:45.208 --> 1:31:51.715
He's still just a kid.

1:31:51.715 --> 1:31:57.804
- You shoulda just...

1:31:57.804 --> 1:32:02.559
you shoulda just let me go.

1:32:50.148 --> 1:32:52.442
- I should have done more,

1:32:52.442 --> 1:32:56.112
Jordie,
I should have gone after you.

1:33:08.333 --> 1:33:12.796
I think maybe it's too late
for me and Alice.

1:33:12.796 --> 1:33:16.800
I got a feeling
she's ready to kick me out.

1:33:16.800 --> 1:33:20.303
Can't be the man
that she needs me to be,

1:33:20.303 --> 1:33:24.849
the right kind of husband,
the right kind of father.

1:33:24.849 --> 1:33:28.603
Hell, I can't be much
of anything these days.

1:33:31.731 --> 1:33:35.568
- You know, myself and a wise
friend of mine would give

1:33:35.568 --> 1:33:42.283
just about anything,
anything to have what you have.

1:33:42.283 --> 1:33:45.078
- A wise friend?

1:33:45.078 --> 1:33:47.080
- Abby.

1:33:49.666 --> 1:33:52.460
You know,
she's worth fighting for,

1:33:52.460 --> 1:33:54.462
your wife.

1:34:06.140 --> 1:34:08.351
- You still got those?

1:34:08.351 --> 1:34:11.437
- Hell ya. From Mom.

1:34:11.437 --> 1:34:14.232
The night we won
the memorial cup.

1:34:14.232 --> 1:34:17.068
- I still got mine too.

1:34:33.167 --> 1:34:36.296
- Seriously! Still?

1:34:45.138 --> 1:34:48.683
- Look, she, ah,
she's kinda grown on me,

1:34:48.683 --> 1:34:51.394
once you get used to her
mood swings and everything.

1:34:51.394 --> 1:34:54.856
Uh, she just kind of a ...

1:34:56.649 --> 1:34:59.777
All right.
All right, have at her.

1:34:59.777 --> 1:35:03.197
Show me that magic touch
you've got.

1:35:09.287 --> 1:35:11.080
That's it?

1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:13.499
- That's it.
- Ya?

1:35:13.499 --> 1:35:15.710
We'll see about that,
brother.

1:35:53.873 --> 1:35:58.920
Will you
take me to the water,

1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:03.299
wash me clean?

1:36:03.299 --> 1:36:08.012
when you're finished

1:36:08.012 --> 1:36:12.850
the same

1:36:12.850 --> 1:36:17.897
of chasing shadows

1:36:17.897 --> 1:36:23.069
darken my night

1:36:23.069 --> 1:36:27.907
into the water

1:36:27.907 --> 1:36:32.829
tonight

1:36:51.222 --> 1:36:56.644
against your body

1:36:56.644 --> 1:37:01.649
believe I am the one

1:37:01.649 --> 1:37:06.779
to hang up my six string

1:37:06.779 --> 1:37:11.075
is done

1:37:11.075 --> 1:37:16.247
against your body

1:37:16.247 --> 1:37:20.752
believe I am the one

1:37:20.752 --> 1:37:26.174
to hang up some memories

1:37:26.174 --> 1:37:31.179
is done

1:37:50.323 --> 1:37:55.161
in your arms now

1:37:55.161 --> 1:37:59.040
need to be alone

1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:04.670
cleanses my worries

1:38:04.670 --> 1:38:09.092
I am home

1:38:09.092 --> 1:38:14.305
take me to the water

1:38:14.305 --> 1:38:18.768
wash me clean

1:38:18.768 --> 1:38:23.981
when you're finished

1:38:23.981 --> 1:38:32.615
I don't wanna feel the same

1:38:32.615 --> 1:38:39.831
feel the same.

1:38:54.720 --> 1:39:03.187
Now you take the wheel,
bring us all home

1:39:09.318 --> 1:39:17.785
over grandfather's bones

1:39:33.467 --> 1:39:42.894
stirs in my soul
