<i>Most people can hold their breath
for about 30 seconds.</i>

02:28.633 --> 02:31.800
<i>I can hold mine for 99.</i>

02:34.505 --> 02:38.644
<i>And Andy Walton takes an early lead
against the lane number two swimmer...</i>

02:38.744 --> 02:39.986
<i>...Clayton Stone.</i>

02:46.066 --> 02:48.796
<i>See, 99 seconds is exactly
how long I needed...</i>

02:48.896 --> 02:52.357
<i>...to win the district championship
in the 200 meter freestyle...</i>

02:52.457 --> 02:55.429
<i>...with Claire Broman,
the girl of my dreams, in the stands.</i>

02:57.828 --> 03:01.581
<i>It's Andy Walton and Clayton Stone
neck and neck here today.</i>

03:05.435 --> 03:08.740
- Yeah, Clayton!
- Come on, Andy. Come on.

03:08.840 --> 03:09.975
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

03:10.075 --> 03:14.914
<i>...Walton and Stone are just one stroke apart
as we near the end of the 200 meters.</i>

03:15.814 --> 03:19.685
<i>I was on the brink of a college
scholarship and a whole new life.</i>

03:20.185 --> 03:24.349
<i>Clayton Stone seizes the championship
by one stroke from Andy Walton!</i>

03:32.696 --> 03:35.109
<i>But in 99 seconds...</i>

03:35.209 --> 03:38.959
<i>...all my dreams came to a crashing end.</i>

03:39.759 --> 03:42.007
<i>Things pretty much went
straight downhill after that.</i>

03:51.282 --> 03:53.318
Hey, sorry I'm late.

03:55.452 --> 03:59.233
- Hey, sucks about the race.
- Okay, loser, whatever.

03:59.333 --> 04:02.738
- You're gonna hook us up, right?
- Party at your place after, right?

04:03.194 --> 04:07.435
- Sure.
- Okay. Meet me outside in 60 seconds.

04:20.944 --> 04:22.947
That was awesome.

04:26.351 --> 04:28.320
Change of plans.

04:28.420 --> 04:30.088
That kid right there in the hat.

04:30.188 --> 04:32.390
Let's go, let's go, come on, get in!

04:33.525 --> 04:36.278
- Don't be an ass, Ryan! Open the door!
- Go, go, go, let's go!

04:42.032 --> 04:44.189
Hey, thanks for the score, loser!

04:46.236 --> 04:50.308
<i>Truth be told, this wasn't
the first time I'd gotten busted.</i>

04:50.408 --> 04:53.678
<i>It was the third this month.</i>

04:53.778 --> 04:56.047
<i>Man, I was in for it.</i>

04:58.549 --> 05:00.211
- You okay?
- Yeah.

05:02.252 --> 05:06.279
The store's not pressing charges,
provided it never happens again.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.348
I can guarantee that.

05:09.448 --> 05:12.497
You jeopardize your mom's job, not to
mention getting me pulled off the line...

05:12.597 --> 05:15.588
...which you well know this family
cannot afford right now.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.157
You need to learn your place, Andy.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.427
I don't have a place.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.794
It's time.

05:26.477 --> 05:28.968
What? No. After this?

05:29.068 --> 05:31.683
Maybe Mark can go, too. I don't know.

05:31.783 --> 05:35.086
- No, it's out of the question.
- What's out of the question?

05:35.186 --> 05:39.324
- You're gonna go see your Uncle Trent.
- Jim, you can't just make this call.

05:39.424 --> 05:41.447
Who is Uncle Trent?

05:44.097 --> 05:45.986
<i>Trent, pick up.</i>

05:46.086 --> 05:49.892
<i>I know you're there.
Come on, man, we need to talk.</i>

05:49.992 --> 05:51.857
<i>It's about Andy.</i>

06:07.417 --> 06:09.174
What's this?

06:10.788 --> 06:15.227
- "To my son, Jim." What?
- What are you doing with my backpack?

06:15.717 --> 06:20.019
- It's got all my tools in perfect order.
- Not anymore. Go back to bed.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.868
- Where are you going?
- They think...

06:25.068 --> 06:28.940
...that they can send me to stay
with someone that I've never even met.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.197
Do you even know who this guy is? Have you
seen any pictures of this Uncle Trent?

06:32.477 --> 06:36.383
It doesn't make any sense. Well, screw that.

06:36.483 --> 06:40.139
I can hitchhike 100 miles before
they even notice. Be good.

06:40.884 --> 06:42.620
- No, Andy, you can't.
- Mark, quiet.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.056
- No. I'm tougher than I look. I'll yell.
- No, don't yell.

06:45.156 --> 06:48.360
Mom! Dad! Andy's running away!

06:48.660 --> 06:51.529
Andy! Stay right there! I'm coming down.

06:51.629 --> 06:53.285
Thanks.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.588
You're welcome.

06:59.636 --> 07:03.675
<i>So there I was, leaving a town
and a school that didn't want me...</i>

07:04.575 --> 07:06.799
<i>...and a family that didn't seem
to want me, either.</i>

07:11.782 --> 07:16.875
<i>Little did I know the biggest race
of my life was just around the corner.</i>

07:19.156 --> 07:21.046
Is that him?

07:21.491 --> 07:24.316
Yep, sure is.

07:35.639 --> 07:37.709
Brought you some fish.

07:37.809 --> 07:40.399
- Can I hold it?
- Yeah, well, it's heavy.

07:43.062 --> 07:44.550
Disgusting!

07:45.382 --> 07:46.985
Hello, Andy.

07:47.585 --> 07:50.997
- Hello, Uncle whoever-you-are.
- Trent.

07:51.335 --> 07:53.150
Your Uncle Trent.

07:55.592 --> 07:59.084
Do you think you can manage
both boys for the weekend?

08:00.230 --> 08:01.599
Okay.

08:01.699 --> 08:04.035
- Yes!
- What? No! There is no way!

08:04.135 --> 08:08.673
Mark has a serious ear condition.
He needs to avoid water at all costs.

08:08.773 --> 08:10.341
- So, he can't swim at all?
- No.

08:10.441 --> 08:12.310
It is bad enough I gotta
be trapped on this island.

08:12.410 --> 08:16.347
- You're gonna stick me with Mark, too?
- Hey, come on.

08:16.447 --> 08:18.103
- What?
- Listen to me.

08:20.851 --> 08:22.987
I know you're pissed at me.

08:23.087 --> 08:27.376
I want you to take care of yourself,
and make sure you watch over Mark, okay?

08:28.326 --> 08:33.785
Promise me you will wear this all day,
every day, and never, ever take it off.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.556
You know this is a mistake.

08:44.641 --> 08:47.700
Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad! I love you!

09:34.091 --> 09:36.255
Okay, jump out and tie us off, will you?

09:40.430 --> 09:44.101
Okay, boys, there's only
one rule on this island.

09:44.201 --> 09:47.404
That is any time you go anywhere
near the water, wear a vest.

09:47.504 --> 09:51.273
When the currents are bad, you'll feel
like you're being flushed down the toilet.

09:57.214 --> 09:59.851
"Walton Island"? Is that us?

09:59.951 --> 10:02.841
- Once upon a time.
- Why are they taking it down?

10:06.823 --> 10:09.628
Hey! What are you doing?

10:10.728 --> 10:12.263
We got two months.

10:12.363 --> 10:15.666
So, they're changing the name of our island?

10:15.766 --> 10:17.008
You can do that?

10:17.108 --> 10:19.671
Pay off the right people,
you can do anything.

10:20.271 --> 10:22.928
Come on, let's take a picture. Keep it up.

10:29.346 --> 10:31.503
That's the way we should've come.

10:33.617 --> 10:35.440
Who is that?

10:37.320 --> 10:38.611
Smile.

11:17.961 --> 11:19.651
Wicked.

11:29.005 --> 11:32.577
- Is there a town?
- Yep, about a mile away.

11:32.677 --> 11:35.366
Hey, what's that over there on the west side?

11:36.346 --> 11:38.350
- Nothing.
- What do you mean "nothing"?

11:38.450 --> 11:41.653
I mean... you've lived on this island your
whole life. You don't know what that is?

11:41.753 --> 11:44.076
I just told you what it is. It's nothing.

11:45.556 --> 11:48.092
Stash your gear, and when I get back...

11:48.192 --> 11:50.900
...I wanna show you
how to wrap some fish guts.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.574
- Twenty.
- Is this bad?

12:15.674 --> 12:18.567
- Yeah.
- I'm all in.

12:19.956 --> 12:22.815
- Flush.
- Not good enough.

12:24.156 --> 12:25.784
Busted.

12:29.232 --> 12:31.056
Unbelievable.

12:38.308 --> 12:41.051
I'll show you how to make one,
if you want. You...

12:41.151 --> 12:45.750
...you write a little note, shove it in there
with the ship, and you launch it out to sea.

12:45.850 --> 12:48.286
Let me get this straight.
You just write these little letters...

12:48.386 --> 12:51.135
...build these little ships
and throw 'em all away?

12:51.235 --> 12:53.858
Gotta do something
with these bottles, don't I?

12:54.558 --> 12:57.762
So, enlighten me, Trent, since this
whole island is named after us...

12:57.862 --> 13:00.164
...we probably weren't always
broke like we are now.

13:00.264 --> 13:03.901
Bingo. You win. We were rich.

13:04.001 --> 13:07.873
See, you're gonna have to elaborate 'cause
I only know what it's like to grow up poor.

13:09.073 --> 13:11.572
I mean, you and my dad were just...

13:11.772 --> 13:15.606
...I don't know, go out to restaurants and
eat every night sort of rich? Like what?

13:15.706 --> 13:18.443
No, no, not like that.

13:19.050 --> 13:21.043
Dynasty rich.

13:21.143 --> 13:25.389
The kind of wealth that generations and
generations of families could live off of.

13:25.689 --> 13:27.492
This was our island.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.802
So, what happened?

13:32.429 --> 13:34.319
Time for bed.

13:37.167 --> 13:39.191
Come on, what happened?

13:41.938 --> 13:43.741
I don't know.

13:44.441 --> 13:46.377
No one knows.

13:46.677 --> 13:50.569
They found my father's boat drifting, and...

13:52.315 --> 13:54.018
...never saw him again.

13:54.318 --> 13:58.956
You're saying that we, the Walton family,
we used to have millions, and now it's gone?

13:59.056 --> 14:01.258
And you, you've never even
bothered to look for it.

14:01.358 --> 14:03.170
Yeah, I did.

14:03.924 --> 14:07.098
- Of course, I did.
- Well, then where's the money?

14:07.898 --> 14:09.734
It's here.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.890
Somewhere. I don't know.

14:12.836 --> 14:16.328
- Had to let it go.
- Are you serious?

14:17.343 --> 14:18.997
Yeah.

14:22.045 --> 14:24.269
And you gotta let it go, kid.

14:31.755 --> 14:34.959
Don't worry. He'll be back, eventually.

14:35.059 --> 14:37.081
Ever see a compass lock?

14:37.994 --> 14:40.552
Have I ever? Watch and learn.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.469
So, was Grandpa really a millionaire?

14:45.569 --> 14:49.673
He was a lot more than that.
He was a code breaker during World War II.

14:49.773 --> 14:51.813
He loved his secrets.

14:51.913 --> 14:55.452
Made the most amazing treasure
hunts for us on our birthday.

15:01.484 --> 15:05.944
I remember the last big hunt. We actually
got to use a real decoder from the war.

15:12.028 --> 15:17.031
The last hunt, it took us
three days to find our presents.

15:17.468 --> 15:20.692
- Three whole days.
- Done.

15:24.607 --> 15:26.465
Stupid uncle.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.857
Stupid...

15:42.560 --> 15:44.495
Move, and I put a hole in you.

15:44.595 --> 15:48.153
- Look, I'm sorry.
- I said, don't move!

15:50.133 --> 15:52.141
On your knees.

15:52.241 --> 15:54.688
And put your hands where I can see 'em.

15:55.205 --> 15:58.009
- What's your name, boy?
- Look, just chill, all right?

15:58.109 --> 15:59.443
Name!

15:59.543 --> 16:02.747
I'm Andrew Walton. Trent Walton's nephew.
The guy who owns the tackle shop!

16:02.847 --> 16:07.117
I know who he is, and now I know who you are.

16:07.217 --> 16:10.508
You ain't the first Walton to go after
your granddaddy's treasure.

16:10.608 --> 16:14.313
But I catch you again,
I'll make sure you're the last.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.184
Yeah, whatever, man.

16:53.996 --> 16:55.866
Have a nice nature walk?

16:55.966 --> 16:58.768
It's here. He just didn't know
where to look for it.

16:59.390 --> 17:03.173
Probably because he never
found Grandpa's treasure map.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.075
What'd you say?

17:05.175 --> 17:08.643
Uncle Trent told me all about it
while you were gone.

17:11.247 --> 17:15.819
- Why are you wearing your life preserver?
- 'Cause Mom told me to. Plus it's cozy.

17:15.920 --> 17:20.191
- What exactly did Trent tell you, Mark?
- Just that Grandpa liked secrets.

17:20.491 --> 17:24.362
He would make Dad and Uncle Trent go on
treasure hunts to find their presents.

17:24.462 --> 17:28.699
It's all starting to make sense. He wanted
them to go on one last hunt together.

17:28.799 --> 17:30.622
So, we're going on the hunt instead?

17:30.722 --> 17:32.705
- Not we. Me.
- Come on.

17:32.955 --> 17:36.140
- Every Don Quixote needs a Sancho Panza.
- You are such a nerd.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.509
Uncle Trent says
it's as good as gone anyways.

17:38.609 --> 17:40.785
You know what?
Uncle Trent had his chance, okay?

17:40.885 --> 17:44.670
But it is my turn now, and I'm not
gonna be poor for the rest of my life.

17:47.517 --> 17:49.554
The old man's fortune is real.

17:50.054 --> 17:53.679
It's on this island, and I'm gonna find it.

18:05.701 --> 18:07.658
"To my son, Jim.

18:07.758 --> 18:10.241
"Unfair and unkind that soon we must part...

18:10.341 --> 18:13.677
"...but beginnings are endings,
and endings are beginnings.

18:13.777 --> 18:16.147
"Be ready, for at these crossroads,
I await discovery.

18:16.247 --> 18:19.371
"Seek your reward
where the gift of time awaits."

18:21.384 --> 18:23.275
"Gift of time"?

18:26.356 --> 18:28.180
The gift of time.

18:50.243 --> 18:52.103
What are you doing?

18:54.417 --> 18:56.220
You scared me.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.478
It's late, man, go to bed.
We got a big day tomorrow.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.534
- That's disgusting.
- You're disgusting.

19:10.634 --> 19:12.491
You're disgusting.

19:14.287 --> 19:17.808
Hello. Maybe this island's
not so bad after all.

19:18.108 --> 19:22.246
Turn around, turn around. Just gotta
set up a little accidental meet and greet.

19:22.346 --> 19:25.045
- A little "hey, how are you?"
- Why don't you just go talk to her?

19:25.145 --> 19:28.819
Look, you don't even like women, okay?
You probably never will, so...

19:28.919 --> 19:30.020
- I like women.
- Yeah?

19:30.120 --> 19:33.156
I just don't see what the big deal is.

19:33.256 --> 19:36.159
Just ask her to get ice cream, or something.

19:36.259 --> 19:39.663
- Ice cream? Are you...
- Everybody loves ice cream.

19:39.763 --> 19:43.955
If you need to know something, you need
to know that chicks don't like ice cream.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.511
They think it makes them fat.

19:50.173 --> 19:51.596
Hey!

19:56.379 --> 19:57.936
Claire?

20:03.686 --> 20:05.422
So, what are you doing here?

20:05.522 --> 20:08.826
Yeah, easy. I got busted.
So my parents sent me to stay with my uncle.

20:08.926 --> 20:12.429
I mean, do you remember?
I stole beer for your boyfriend...

20:12.529 --> 20:15.332
...and you left me with a security
guard's knee in my back.

20:15.432 --> 20:16.938
It was awesome.

20:17.368 --> 20:20.438
We just got here yesterday.
Do you know the island pretty good?

20:20.538 --> 20:24.675
Yeah, well, my dad has a house out here,
so I'm kind of stuck here all summer.

20:24.775 --> 20:27.632
- You looking for something?
- Hidden treasure.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.714
- Hidden what?
- Treasures, you know.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.818
Cool... cool spots on the island.

20:33.918 --> 20:36.371
Well, there's a general store in town.

20:36.471 --> 20:38.488
Pretty good ice cream.

20:38.588 --> 20:40.086
Yeah.

20:40.397 --> 20:44.262
Yeah, I love... I love ice cream.
I can eat ice cream all day.

20:46.229 --> 20:48.576
All right, see you boys later.

20:48.866 --> 20:50.521
Okay.

20:52.802 --> 20:56.395
"I love ice cream.
I could eat ice cream all day."

21:00.576 --> 21:04.068
<i>Hidden treasure,
lost fortune, where to begin?</i>

21:04.348 --> 21:07.851
<i>All I had was a rusty pocket watch and Mark.</i>

21:07.951 --> 21:10.212
<i>We decided to kill two birds with one stone.</i>

21:10.312 --> 21:13.524
<i>Get a little ice cream
and explore Walton Island.</i>

21:13.624 --> 21:16.293
<i>The whole place looked
like it was going under.</i>

21:16.393 --> 21:18.617
<i>Guess we weren't the only ones
who'd lost everything.</i>

21:21.164 --> 21:23.167
Are you stalking me?

21:24.167 --> 21:26.891
It's an island. Don't flatter yourself.

21:27.336 --> 21:30.482
- Made up your mind yet?
- Mint chip, please. Double scoop.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.079
You boys are Waltons, ain't ya?

21:35.879 --> 21:37.935
Got your grandfather's eyes.

21:38.514 --> 21:41.518
- You knew him?
- Everyone knew him, hon.

21:41.618 --> 21:44.775
If he was with us, we could stay in peace.

21:44.875 --> 21:47.144
Instead, we have to start over.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.650
How much for the ice cream?

21:52.829 --> 21:54.631
That's $10,000.

21:54.731 --> 21:58.322
But don't worry, Miss Broman.
Your father can afford it.

21:58.701 --> 22:01.238
Actually, I'm buying.

22:01.338 --> 22:04.828
In that case, it's on the house.

22:05.675 --> 22:07.082
Thanks.

22:10.112 --> 22:11.369
What are you getting?

22:17.754 --> 22:19.644
Hello, Trent.

22:23.659 --> 22:26.130
I hear you found yourself some cheap labor.

22:26.230 --> 22:28.799
I got till the end of the summer.
What are you doing here?

22:28.899 --> 22:31.535
Yes, well, that was the old deal.

22:31.635 --> 22:35.406
This one has a 10% bonus...

22:36.106 --> 22:38.662
...if you move out by the end of the month.

22:40.810 --> 22:42.868
How about you go to hell?

22:45.449 --> 22:47.751
Trent, Trent, Trent.

22:47.851 --> 22:50.508
When are you going to learn?

22:51.888 --> 22:55.226
There's no future
in this bait and tackle shop.

22:55.826 --> 23:01.186
In a year, this island will be the premier
tourist spot for miles around.

23:03.666 --> 23:06.570
Tell you what.
I'm willing to sweeten the deal.

23:06.670 --> 23:09.139
We're planning on
building a gift store here...

23:09.239 --> 23:13.777
...I'm willing to let you run it for,
say, 5% of net profit?

23:13.877 --> 23:17.102
Heck, you could sell quite a lot
of your ships in a bottle.

23:29.959 --> 23:32.095
I think I can make this better.

23:32.195 --> 23:33.751
Yeah.

23:39.902 --> 23:41.972
This is my father's island.

23:42.272 --> 23:44.245
Walton Island.

23:57.486 --> 23:59.377
Not for long.

24:20.710 --> 24:25.482
<i>My plan was evolving.
Find the treasure, save the island.</i>

24:25.582 --> 24:29.040
<i>Save the island, get the girl.</i>

24:31.053 --> 24:34.057
<i>All those things were looking really good...</i>

24:34.157 --> 24:36.346
<i>...and totally, completely impossible.</i>

24:37.268 --> 24:39.718
<i>How was I ever gonna get a girl like that?</i>

24:41.998 --> 24:43.633
Hey, what are those?

24:43.733 --> 24:45.990
That's the West Forest.

24:48.471 --> 24:50.708
Your uncle hasn't told you much, has he?

24:51.608 --> 24:53.951
Those crosses are for the nine people
who vanished there.

24:54.051 --> 24:56.446
- What? Come on.
- Yeah.

24:56.546 --> 25:00.117
- Are they buried there?
- No. They were never found.

25:00.617 --> 25:03.397
People have seen some strange things here.

25:03.497 --> 25:04.979
Ghost.

25:05.079 --> 25:08.319
A haunted forest? Cool.
Finally something fun to do.

25:08.419 --> 25:11.995
No! No way! Mark, come on, stop!

25:12.095 --> 25:14.564
Come on, Claire.
They're just ghost stories, okay?

25:14.664 --> 25:18.138
There's nine stakes in the ground
for a reason. I'm not trying to be 10.

25:18.238 --> 25:20.324
You better get him out of there.

25:26.309 --> 25:27.865
Mark.

25:33.482 --> 25:35.006
Mark!

25:38.220 --> 25:40.711
Mark, come on, man. Where are you?

25:41.641 --> 25:43.264
Mark!

25:52.902 --> 25:57.712
- Andy! Andy, help!
- Mark! Mark!

25:59.375 --> 26:02.133
Mark! Mark, where are you?

26:03.880 --> 26:07.784
Dude! Dude! Don't do that.

26:07.884 --> 26:11.455
- Where's your girlfriend?
- She's not my girlfriend. Come on, let's go.

26:13.089 --> 26:16.093
You know, if I was burying a treasure,
this is where I'd put it.

26:16.193 --> 26:20.918
No, it's gotta have something to do
with time, like a watch or a clock, maybe.

26:21.630 --> 26:23.734
You don't bury treasure in a clock.

26:23.834 --> 26:26.368
No, numb-nuts. It's a metaphor.

26:26.468 --> 26:27.648
Andy!

26:37.113 --> 26:38.803
Andy!

26:40.149 --> 26:43.140
Andy! Andy, are you okay?

26:43.620 --> 26:46.077
Yeah. I think so.

26:55.364 --> 26:57.452
Oh, God! Oh, God!

27:01.270 --> 27:04.800
- Andy, what do you want me to do?
- Go get Trent!

27:04.900 --> 27:08.165
- Go get Uncle Trent. Hurry!
- Okay, okay.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.949
Come on, Mark, where are you? Come on.

27:40.242 --> 27:43.972
"Spooky", she said.
"Don't go in there," she said.

28:05.567 --> 28:07.971
Andy? Andy, where are you?

28:08.071 --> 28:10.550
Uncle Trent? Hey!

28:10.650 --> 28:14.077
Hey! Hey! Hey, I'm down here!

28:14.177 --> 28:18.615
All right. I got you. All right,
all right, hold on, I'm coming.

28:18.715 --> 28:21.338
Thank God. Thank God.

28:26.221 --> 28:28.691
Do you wanna tell me
why you went into the West Forest?

28:28.791 --> 28:30.760
Ask Mark. He's the one who went in.

28:30.860 --> 28:34.351
Ask Andy. He's the one who thinks
he can find Grandpa's treasure.

28:34.817 --> 28:36.898
And Claire thinks there's ghosts.

28:39.744 --> 28:42.649
How old are you? Ghosts?

28:42.749 --> 28:45.752
You haven't listened to a thing I said
since you been here, have you?

28:45.852 --> 28:49.922
Have you? You think I just
talk to hear myself speak?

28:50.022 --> 28:53.627
I told you not to go into the forest. There's
nothing in there, and there is nothing.

28:53.727 --> 28:56.749
There's not treasure. There's not ghosts.

28:57.096 --> 28:58.966
Don't go in.

28:59.566 --> 29:01.405
Am I clear?

29:02.077 --> 29:03.781
I'm not gonna say this again.

29:11.243 --> 29:15.449
If you want Claire to like you back, maybe
you should grow one of your claws bigger.

29:15.549 --> 29:18.251
Dude! Wait, what?

29:18.351 --> 29:19.853
Well, that's what these guys do.

29:19.953 --> 29:23.366
You see, the boy lobster grows
one claw bigger than the other...

29:23.466 --> 29:25.235
...not even to hunt or anything.

29:25.335 --> 29:28.441
It's really just to impress...

29:28.541 --> 29:30.807
...the girl lobster. It's true.

29:30.907 --> 29:32.943
You know the most random crap, you know that?

29:33.043 --> 29:36.579
It's not crap.
You're just jealous 'cause you don't...

29:36.679 --> 29:38.193
Hey!

29:38.293 --> 29:40.771
- Mark, it's okay.
- Andy!

29:42.918 --> 29:46.010
Once they get ahold of you
like that, they never let go.

29:47.056 --> 29:48.826
Here, let's have a look.

29:49.326 --> 29:51.461
Oh, you'll survive.

29:51.561 --> 29:55.319
Rinse that with cold water and put
a compress on it. You'll be fine.

29:57.833 --> 30:01.338
- Thank you. I didn't know what to do.
- Well, next time you will.

30:02.138 --> 30:04.908
There are two kinds
of creatures in this world.

30:05.008 --> 30:09.628
The ones that pick a fight,
and the ones that finish it.

30:10.246 --> 30:12.075
This one...

30:12.326 --> 30:15.185
...picked wrong. John Broman.

30:15.285 --> 30:19.289
- Andrew Walton.
- Are you any relation to Richard Walton?

30:19.389 --> 30:22.158
Yeah, yeah, he was my grandfather.
You knew him?

30:22.258 --> 30:24.494
No, no, I wish I had.

30:24.594 --> 30:26.644
I'm a great admirer of his.

30:26.744 --> 30:28.837
That's why I bought his house.

30:29.198 --> 30:31.622
- You didn't know?
- No.

30:33.835 --> 30:37.515
Why don't you bring the rest of these over,
and I'll have my chef cook us a nice dinner.

30:37.615 --> 30:39.567
We'll give you a tour. What do you say?

30:39.667 --> 30:43.901
- Sure.
- You're a finisher, aren't you, Andrew?

30:47.850 --> 30:50.754
- I think so.
- Don't think so.

30:50.854 --> 30:52.643
Know so.

30:53.555 --> 30:55.812
I never pick wrong.

30:57.025 --> 31:00.364
So... shall we say about 8:00?

31:00.914 --> 31:02.486
Yeah.

31:22.384 --> 31:23.907
Hey.

31:24.853 --> 31:26.911
You sure that's her style?

31:34.697 --> 31:37.188
Her dad invited me out tonight, so...

31:40.736 --> 31:46.574
Look, I've known John Broman
a long time, and he's a snake.

31:46.674 --> 31:49.033
Look, I got my reasons for going.

31:53.282 --> 31:55.303
I bet you do.

31:56.151 --> 31:57.775
Hey.

31:58.487 --> 32:00.358
Good luck, kid.

32:04.460 --> 32:06.116
Thanks.

32:07.629 --> 32:10.901
<i>Luck? Yeah. Never had much of that.</i>

32:11.001 --> 32:14.070
<i>But what I did have
was a bag full of lobsters...</i>

32:14.170 --> 32:16.873
<i>...and I was gonna use it
to get some answers.</i>

32:16.973 --> 32:21.177
<i>If this Broman guy, that everybody hates,
lives in my grandfather's house...</i>

32:21.277 --> 32:25.436
<i>...and he's interested in me?
No way that's a coincidence.</i>

32:31.887 --> 32:34.806
<i>If there were answers, they were here.</i>

32:35.392 --> 32:37.315
<i>They just had to be.</i>

32:59.047 --> 33:01.283
Looking for something?

33:01.901 --> 33:04.120
I was just admiring your clock.

33:04.621 --> 33:07.878
- I brought lobster.
- Splendid.

33:09.558 --> 33:12.228
- Mildred!
- Yes, sir.

33:12.328 --> 33:14.330
Have the chef prepare these for us,
will you, please?

33:14.430 --> 33:15.432
Right away.

33:15.532 --> 33:18.501
When you said you were living
in my grandfather's house I just...

33:18.601 --> 33:21.004
...thought it was a normal house.
This is beautiful.

33:21.104 --> 33:24.762
Yes, yes, we're very fond of it.
It's like a home away from home.

33:26.275 --> 33:28.499
- Right this way.
- Okay.

33:34.883 --> 33:38.188
So, how are you enjoying
your time on the island so far?

33:38.288 --> 33:41.711
Have you had a chance to do any exploring?

33:42.490 --> 33:44.093
You know, a little.

33:44.193 --> 33:46.988
I presume you've heard
of your grandfather's lost fortune.

33:48.697 --> 33:51.913
- No, I haven't.
- Really?

33:52.413 --> 33:54.670
My dear boy, it's legendary.

33:54.770 --> 33:57.594
You mean to tell me your parents
never told you about it?

33:59.140 --> 34:02.112
There was once a pirate named William Kidd...

34:02.212 --> 34:04.414
...back in the 17th century.

34:04.514 --> 34:06.582
And apparently, before he died...

34:06.682 --> 34:10.786
...Kidd buried almost $10 million
in gold somewhere in Long Island.

34:10.887 --> 34:15.692
Your grandfather's hidden treasure
is estimated to be twice that.

34:15.992 --> 34:21.697
Being Richard Walton's grandson,
seems to me that you're the natural heir.

34:22.931 --> 34:26.934
Unfortunately, I'm completely preoccupied
with developing this island...

34:27.034 --> 34:29.255
...or else I'd look for it myself.

34:30.206 --> 34:34.377
I'll tell you what. If you discover
anything on my island, it's all yours.

34:34.877 --> 34:38.469
It would appear you have
a treasure hunt ahead of you.

34:41.717 --> 34:43.452
Hello?

34:43.552 --> 34:47.190
Yes, hold on. I'm so sorry. I have
to take this call. It's rather private.

34:47.290 --> 34:49.146
Oh, yeah, sure.

34:54.295 --> 34:56.666
Glad to see you made it
out of the forest alive.

34:57.166 --> 34:59.218
You know what? Here.

34:59.961 --> 35:02.105
Got you something.
Just so you don't have to put up...

35:02.205 --> 35:05.840
...with that ice cream lady's attitude
next time you need a fix.

35:05.940 --> 35:07.077
Thanks.

35:07.177 --> 35:10.313
So, my dad and Trent grew up here. Crazy.

35:10.413 --> 35:12.669
I can't believe they're tearing it down.

35:13.915 --> 35:15.184
What?

35:15.284 --> 35:17.974
Eighteenth fairway
is going right through here.

35:18.353 --> 35:20.878
That's your grandfather right there.

35:22.391 --> 35:24.414
Breaks my heart.

35:24.860 --> 35:26.864
I love this house.

35:28.264 --> 35:31.321
Hey, before they tear it down,
I have something to show you.

35:35.871 --> 35:37.605
This is my favorite room in the house.

35:49.984 --> 35:51.841
Do you play?

36:11.840 --> 36:15.878
"Authentic World War II Cipher Decoder
used by U.S. Navy intelligence."

36:15.978 --> 36:18.048
My dad's prize possession.

36:18.648 --> 36:21.472
Basically useless, though. Try opening it.

36:26.221 --> 36:30.080
Yeah, the only way is with a key.
Your grandfather's design.

36:40.302 --> 36:42.038
Hardly see my dad all year...

36:42.138 --> 36:44.674
...and then he forces me to come
to this island every summer...

36:44.774 --> 36:47.597
...just so he can sit
in his office and ignore me.

36:47.697 --> 36:49.913
And your parents, when did they...

36:50.313 --> 36:52.081
- When did they split?
- Yeah.

36:52.181 --> 36:53.983
Long time ago.

36:54.483 --> 36:58.809
My mom got remarried,
new step-kids, new life.

37:00.088 --> 37:02.345
Yeah, I get it.

37:03.458 --> 37:06.129
Sometimes it's lonely when it feels like...

37:06.229 --> 37:07.972
Nothing fits?

37:10.632 --> 37:13.349
Yeah, but at least you don't have
your parents breathing down your neck.

37:13.449 --> 37:16.005
And plus, you're rich.
I would trade you in a second.

37:16.105 --> 37:19.309
No, be careful what you wish for.

37:19.809 --> 37:22.412
You know, no disrespect or anything...

37:22.512 --> 37:26.149
...but don't front like
you have it rough, okay?

37:26.249 --> 37:29.940
You have money.
You can pretty much fit anywhere.

37:34.456 --> 37:36.793
Your family was wealthy once, too.

37:36.893 --> 37:38.295
That house?

37:38.395 --> 37:42.385
It all could've been yours until Trent
lost it to my dad in a card game.

37:46.001 --> 37:47.857
That's impossible.

37:55.710 --> 37:57.813
I'm having the best time ever.

37:57.913 --> 38:02.118
I'm learning how to catch lobster,
play poker.

38:02.518 --> 38:06.823
Please, can I stay, Dad?
I'll do anything. Please?

38:06.923 --> 38:10.526
Okay, hey, hey, hey.
Okay, buddy, you can stay.

38:10.626 --> 38:14.263
Sounds like you're having fun.
No more poker. Promise.

38:14.363 --> 38:18.055
- <i>Put Uncle Trent on the phone.</i>
- Yes! Thank you! Love you, Dad, bye!

38:20.568 --> 38:23.439
- Yeah?
- <i>Did you do it yet?</i>

38:24.539 --> 38:26.009
I'm working on it.

38:26.109 --> 38:29.589
<i>How about you stop working on it,
Trent, and you actually do it?</i>

38:29.689 --> 38:32.815
- That was the deal.
- No, that was your deal, not mine.

38:32.915 --> 38:35.490
<i>You didn't agree to anything.
How about just once...</i>

38:35.590 --> 38:39.769
<i>...you don't have to agree and negotiate?
You just take responsibility for something.</i>

38:39.869 --> 38:42.602
That would be such a miracle
in my little life, Trent...

38:42.702 --> 38:46.729
<i>...if you just took responsibility for
something other than wiping your own butt.</i>

38:46.829 --> 38:48.598
<i>I've been taking after you your whole life.</i>

38:48.698 --> 38:52.301
<i>It must be nice to just, sort of,
like, play footsie with the wind.</i>

38:52.401 --> 38:55.859
<i>What are you teaching 'em poker for,
anyway? No more gambling...</i>

38:58.039 --> 39:01.264
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Everything's peachy.

39:05.347 --> 39:07.437
<i>That was super funny, Trent...</i>

39:33.908 --> 39:37.146
<i>I probably should've left well
enough alone and kept on riding, but...</i>

39:37.246 --> 39:39.949
<i>...time wasn't on my side,
and I needed answers.</i>

39:40.049 --> 39:43.474
<i>These guys were either guarding
something, or looking for something.</i>

39:44.986 --> 39:47.111
<i>Either way, I wasn't alone.</i>

39:49.184 --> 39:50.714
Hey! Stop!

39:57.015 --> 40:01.286
<i>This wasn't just a treasure hunt anymore.
This was a race. It was time to get serious.</i>

40:02.320 --> 40:04.177
Where's Uncle Trent?

40:18.453 --> 40:20.857
<i>A second gold pocket watch?</i>

40:21.257 --> 40:23.514
<i>Maybe my luck was changing after all.</i>

40:27.929 --> 40:29.882
"To my son, Trent.

40:29.982 --> 40:33.586
"Here I am revealed after the day
is done and the burning sun sets.

40:33.736 --> 40:35.938
"Yesterday and tomorrow
destined to be your guide...

40:36.038 --> 40:39.195
"...ever and always
the constant of constants."

40:42.889 --> 40:44.730
What are you doing?

40:48.516 --> 40:50.608
It's all I have left of my father.

41:01.029 --> 41:02.926
Look, Trent...

41:03.270 --> 41:06.703
...there are people in the West Forest.
Okay, we need to do something.

41:06.803 --> 41:10.573
- You went back in that forest?
- One of them took a shot at me.

41:10.673 --> 41:12.896
They're looking for something, Trent.

41:14.542 --> 41:17.814
You go back in that forest again, consider
yourself locked in your room the rest...

41:17.914 --> 41:19.735
Are you not listening to me?

41:20.177 --> 41:23.683
They're gonna tear our family home
to the ground! And we still got time...

41:23.783 --> 41:25.850
- ...but we are running out.
- Enough!

41:25.950 --> 41:29.712
It is over.
I had told you that already. Stop!

41:30.225 --> 41:32.315
You know what? Go to your room.

41:32.861 --> 41:34.718
Go to my room.

41:36.297 --> 41:39.769
Who do you think you are, my father?

41:40.469 --> 41:43.427
Or just some guy who sucks at playing cards?

41:47.242 --> 41:49.052
So, it's true.

41:50.145 --> 41:51.801
Don't go there, kid.

41:52.381 --> 41:54.270
Try me.

41:56.818 --> 41:59.055
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:59.155 --> 42:03.113
You know what happens when you
don't pay your property taxes?

42:04.693 --> 42:08.097
The government seizes everything.

42:08.197 --> 42:12.044
And my father, your grandfather,
in his infinite genius...

42:12.144 --> 42:16.471
...decided to stash his money,
but he forgot to tell anyone where it was.

42:16.571 --> 42:21.144
So, eventually, all we had left
on this whole island was that house.

42:21.844 --> 42:25.681
And they were coming for that.
That was just a matter of time.

42:25.781 --> 42:27.817
So, yes...

42:28.417 --> 42:34.244
...I walked into that poker game with Broman
because it was my last and only play.

42:37.325 --> 42:39.182
And I lost.

42:40.161 --> 42:42.019
I lost everything.

42:44.799 --> 42:46.823
Do you know why you're here?

42:51.806 --> 42:53.443
This.

42:54.443 --> 42:56.879
What is this? What is this?

42:56.979 --> 43:00.899
Do you think I ditched my life
to build a ship in a bottle...

43:00.999 --> 43:04.707
...with some deadbeat, broke-down
alcoholic uncle that I have never met?

43:04.807 --> 43:07.542
- Would you listen to me for once?
- No, no, listen! You know what?

43:07.642 --> 43:09.591
You know what? Fine, let's do this.

43:09.691 --> 43:13.362
Do we just write some little fortune
cookie note and toss it in the ocean...

43:13.462 --> 43:15.717
...or is that just your excuse...

43:16.983 --> 43:19.028
...to empty another bottle?

43:39.421 --> 43:41.277
Go away!

43:44.025 --> 43:47.050
Get in, get in. Close the door.

43:49.697 --> 43:51.267
He told you not to touch that.

43:51.367 --> 43:53.602
No, this is Dad's. I stole it before we left.

43:53.702 --> 43:56.309
My God, you're gonna get
into so much trouble.

43:56.409 --> 43:58.628
What do you think I'm in now, Mark?

44:03.978 --> 44:06.415
It looks exactly like the other one.

44:06.515 --> 44:09.172
Yeah, I know.
The inscriptions and everything.

44:11.486 --> 44:15.391
"To my son, Jim. Unfair and unkind
that soon we must part.

44:16.091 --> 44:19.194
"But beginnings are endings,
and endings are beginnings.

44:19.294 --> 44:22.731
"Be ready, for at these crossroads,
I await discovery.

44:22.831 --> 44:26.689
"Seek your reward
where the gift of time awaits."

44:27.135 --> 44:29.359
Where do endings and beginnings meet?

44:33.474 --> 44:38.113
Midnight! The beginning of a new day
meets the ending of the last.

44:38.213 --> 44:41.447
- What did the other pocket watch say?
- Something...

44:42.147 --> 44:44.553
...about a guide after sunset,
like a sunset guide.

44:44.653 --> 44:48.576
Oh, that's easy. There's only
one constant guide after sunset.

44:48.676 --> 44:50.546
So, what is it?

44:53.094 --> 44:56.399
- I know something you don't.
- Come on, tell me, you little twerp.

44:56.499 --> 44:59.535
No, you said you were going
on this hunt, not me.

44:59.635 --> 45:03.527
You're Don Quixote,
and you don't need a Sancho Panza.

45:06.941 --> 45:09.442
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

45:10.579 --> 45:12.869
We're going on the hunt together.

45:13.381 --> 45:16.608
- Promise?
- Would I lie to you...

45:17.312 --> 45:19.001
...Sancho?

45:19.887 --> 45:24.593
The North Star! The only thing in
the night sky that never, ever moves.

45:24.693 --> 45:27.583
Holy ship in a bottle, I think you're right.

45:28.843 --> 45:31.320
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

45:34.903 --> 45:37.039
You're sure that's the North Star, right?

45:37.139 --> 45:39.141
- Yeah, that's it.
- Okay.

45:39.241 --> 45:41.531
But what do we do now?

45:42.944 --> 45:45.218
I don't know. I guess we wait.

45:46.514 --> 45:48.781
And it's...

45:49.051 --> 45:50.840
...midnight.

45:59.260 --> 46:01.484
Maybe your watch is a little fast.

46:08.569 --> 46:11.878
Andy, what's past the stars?

46:13.841 --> 46:15.665
Past the stars?

46:17.245 --> 46:21.838
I don't know, Mark. I have a hard
enough time figuring out life down here.

46:45.521 --> 46:48.165
Hey, wake up. We gotta get back.

46:50.345 --> 46:53.482
I don't see why you're so mad.

46:53.582 --> 46:57.720
Well, obviously, one of us was wrong, and
I'm pretty sure midnight was right, so...

46:57.820 --> 47:01.390
The North Star was right, too.
Maybe we were just in the wrong place.

47:01.490 --> 47:03.859
Yeah, unless it has nothing
to do with the North Star...

47:03.959 --> 47:07.317
...and I'm just wasting my time
with you, Sancho.

47:11.599 --> 47:13.836
I just need three more days.

47:14.536 --> 47:16.972
Yes, I tried the tactical approach...

47:17.072 --> 47:19.311
...but there are always more...

47:19.716 --> 47:21.974
...convincing measures.

47:23.111 --> 47:25.948
He'll leave, and they'll all follow.
Trust me.

47:26.048 --> 47:28.471
We can break ground by the end of the month.

47:30.251 --> 47:33.255
- Wanna play some cards?
- Hold on one second.

47:33.355 --> 47:36.192
Not now, darling.
I'm right in the middle of something.

47:36.892 --> 47:39.482
We will be on time and on schedule.

47:43.197 --> 47:47.549
<i>Secrets, lies, and dead-ends.
Even the stars were against me.</i>

47:47.649 --> 47:50.593
<i>We were getting back pretty late,
but as long as Trent wasn't an early riser...</i>

47:50.693 --> 47:52.725
<i>...we'd be in the clear.</i>

47:54.342 --> 47:56.166
<i>No such luck.</i>

47:59.180 --> 48:02.205
Well, thank God.

48:17.131 --> 48:18.988
What the heck?

48:19.500 --> 48:23.326
You really think that you could stay out
all night without saying anything?

48:25.606 --> 48:28.298
- You, too.
- Me?

48:34.382 --> 48:36.386
Sucks about your ride.

48:37.386 --> 48:40.609
For what it's worth, I'd take
a bike over an escalade any day.

48:44.392 --> 48:47.577
Look, I just came by to say that...

48:47.983 --> 48:49.417
...I'm sorry.

48:49.831 --> 48:52.055
I thought you knew about the poker game.

48:58.105 --> 49:00.309
Wanna come out with Mark and I tonight?

49:01.009 --> 49:04.813
Bonfire on the beach, sing <i>Kumbaya.</i>

49:05.013 --> 49:07.069
I got something for you.

49:16.324 --> 49:18.347
So, what do you got for me?

49:20.361 --> 49:23.253
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

49:29.203 --> 49:33.529
Okay. I saw you checking this out earlier.

49:34.009 --> 49:36.078
Maybe we can make a trade.

49:36.678 --> 49:39.102
I saw you checking this out before.

49:40.782 --> 49:42.661
I mean...

49:42.761 --> 49:47.423
...no offense. I thank you,
but I just... I will never wear that.

49:47.523 --> 49:49.947
- I'll take it.
- Yeah?

49:54.562 --> 49:58.043
Hey, Mark, you see
that lighthouse over there?

49:58.533 --> 50:01.136
You know your grandfather
built that, too, right?

50:01.236 --> 50:05.394
- You should go check it out.
- Yeah, Mark, you should go check it out.

50:05.873 --> 50:08.931
No way. I've only had one s'more.

50:13.881 --> 50:15.105
Fine.

50:20.621 --> 50:22.032
Have fun.

50:25.626 --> 50:29.365
So, you and Ryan, are you guys...

50:30.998 --> 50:32.855
Forget Ryan.

50:33.534 --> 50:35.592
I don't like you like him.

50:37.338 --> 50:39.228
I like you like you.

51:09.237 --> 51:10.793
Yes!

51:13.507 --> 51:15.398
Andy!

51:16.777 --> 51:19.468
You won't believe it! I...

51:19.848 --> 51:22.906
- Wait, were you two...
- Nothing. We're nothing.

51:24.251 --> 51:27.589
You were! You were sitting in a tree!

51:27.689 --> 51:30.225
What did you figure out, Mark?
Better be good.

51:30.325 --> 51:34.463
The answer to the clue.
It's been here the whole time.

51:34.563 --> 51:36.565
Right in front of us.

51:37.165 --> 51:39.101
Okay, so what is a Polaris?

51:39.201 --> 51:43.005
Polaris, the brightest star
in the night sky, the North Star.

51:43.105 --> 51:44.606
On the north tip of the island.

51:44.706 --> 51:48.431
Dude, this is the first time I'm actually
stoked that you're a boy scout.

51:55.115 --> 51:59.388
Let me get this straight. You think your
grandfather's lost fortune is in a lighthouse?

51:59.488 --> 52:01.543
There's only one way to find out.

52:07.861 --> 52:09.756
Come on.

52:13.067 --> 52:15.838
Andy, come on! I wanna go.

52:15.938 --> 52:18.727
Hey, Andy, there's something else down here.

52:22.643 --> 52:26.703
- What is this place?
- This must be the map room.

52:28.716 --> 52:31.808
Come on, Grandpa, where is it?

52:33.154 --> 52:35.511
Isn't "X" supposed to mark the spot?

52:38.993 --> 52:40.645
No.

52:40.962 --> 52:43.019
But "XII" does.

52:45.332 --> 52:47.156
Here, shine a light.

52:49.336 --> 52:51.561
Polaris at midnight.

53:08.923 --> 53:10.966
"Exceptional work, my sons.

53:11.226 --> 53:14.376
"Rest not. You now hold every clue."

53:18.199 --> 53:22.288
- What?
- Great. Grandpa was crazy.

53:24.972 --> 53:27.296
If only we had the other pocket watch.

53:28.375 --> 53:31.934
Dude! You little ninja.

53:57.571 --> 53:59.292
Guys, look! Check this out!

54:09.516 --> 54:12.121
"Use birthday decoder."

54:12.821 --> 54:15.924
The World War II decoder at your house.
We have to get it.

54:16.024 --> 54:19.594
No, no, my dad would kill you
if he caught you even breathing on it.

54:19.694 --> 54:21.596
Plus, it's really far.

54:21.696 --> 54:24.254
Uncle Trent locked our bikes, remember?

55:04.305 --> 55:08.009
Got enough cash for all your little
minions running around here.

55:08.109 --> 55:09.544
You think we're stupid?

55:09.644 --> 55:12.714
Look, you're not the only ones
with your ass in a sling.

55:12.814 --> 55:15.984
I have developers flying in
from China in 72 hours.

55:16.084 --> 55:18.887
If I can't deliver on my share,
I'm out of the deal.

55:18.987 --> 55:21.820
Out. Do you understand what that means?

55:21.920 --> 55:25.580
Sounds like you're trying to squeeze
a few more nickels for yourself.

55:25.680 --> 55:29.231
- Stay here. I'll get the key.
- No, no, no, wait till they leave.

55:29.331 --> 55:31.420
Trust me. Don't worry.

55:32.300 --> 55:34.823
Hi, Daddy. Everything all right?

55:34.923 --> 55:38.327
Yes. Just doing business, sweetheart.
Do you need me for something?

55:38.427 --> 55:42.697
I'm just gonna get the cards,
play some solitaire and then go to bed.

55:42.797 --> 55:44.670
All right, look...

55:44.770 --> 55:48.845
...I'm asking you to wait
a little while longer, all right?

55:49.671 --> 55:51.760
We're getting close.

55:52.573 --> 55:54.396
Night, Daddy.

56:02.282 --> 56:04.106
Good night, sweetheart.

56:12.126 --> 56:14.463
I'll be there in a minute. Just go.

56:14.563 --> 56:16.419
We'll all be winners.

56:21.468 --> 56:23.358
Here, here.

56:30.778 --> 56:34.337
- Mark, read me that message, quick.
- What? Okay.

56:35.282 --> 56:40.789
"N-D-D-F-space-I."

56:40.889 --> 56:44.793
Look, as I've already told you, there's
a fortune to be made with this island...

56:44.893 --> 56:48.763
...and it starts with finding out where
the old man has buried his money.

56:48.863 --> 56:50.465
It's my buy-in.

56:50.565 --> 56:54.903
Without it, I have to stand
on the sidelines and watch...

56:55.203 --> 56:58.874
...so I suggest you get back
out there and find it.

56:59.174 --> 57:02.098
"C-O-B-E-B."

57:11.418 --> 57:13.275
Someone's coming.

57:18.392 --> 57:20.682
Go, go, go, go, go!

57:22.796 --> 57:26.155
Dude, come on! Don't!
What are you... Come on!

58:18.052 --> 58:19.754
Dad.

58:20.554 --> 58:22.411
What are you doing?

58:23.257 --> 58:26.995
You took my key, didn't you?
They're here, aren't they?

58:27.095 --> 58:29.952
- Oh, my God.
- Claire!

58:42.576 --> 58:44.900
Come on. Pass me the flashlight.

58:53.287 --> 58:56.679
Hey, this must be
Grandpa's secret passageway.

58:58.225 --> 59:01.250
I hope we don't find
any dead things back here.

59:07.468 --> 59:09.959
Hey, what's that?

59:15.409 --> 59:18.634
- You think we're supposed to take it?
- I guess.

59:23.116 --> 59:24.940
Let's go.

59:28.255 --> 59:30.111
Hey, this way.

59:38.900 --> 59:42.170
My dad's on to you.
You guys need to get out of here now.

59:42.270 --> 59:44.093
Okay, come on.

01:00:03.023 --> 01:00:05.881
- Let's take a look at that message.
- All right.

01:00:08.162 --> 01:00:12.433
"One final step to discover
a treasure that will never run dry.

01:00:12.533 --> 01:00:16.538
"Be warned. What lies beneath
is the root of all evil.

01:00:16.638 --> 01:00:19.709
"Look under the West Forest roses."

01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:24.379
All right, we can't just wander into that
forest again. It's time to gear up, okay?

01:00:24.479 --> 01:00:25.814
- Walkie-talkies.
- Check.

01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:27.949
- Lantern.
- Check.

01:00:28.049 --> 01:00:30.185
I'm asking you to wait a little while longer.

01:00:30.285 --> 01:00:33.253
Once this deal goes through,
we'll all be rich.

01:00:33.353 --> 01:00:35.210
Enough talk.

01:00:35.989 --> 01:00:39.497
- Open the safe.
- Don't be foolhardy, Ridgewick.

01:00:39.597 --> 01:00:41.340
You know I know how to use this.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.458
Years of practice out in that forest...

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.590
...killing for you.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:50.720
- Open it!
- All right, all right.

01:00:51.852 --> 01:00:54.777
You want your money? Here it is.

01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:08.624
Don't ever threaten me again.

01:01:09.937 --> 01:01:12.762
Get him out of here. He's bleeding on my rug.

01:01:22.416 --> 01:01:24.840
Go get the stuff. Go, go, go.

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:32.748
I'm sorry I borrowed your truck,
but it's back, so...

01:01:34.895 --> 01:01:37.719
I mean, you can hate me all you want.

01:01:38.348 --> 01:01:40.406
I don't hate you, kid.

01:01:41.902 --> 01:01:43.793
You're just like me.

01:01:46.873 --> 01:01:50.266
Wanna know why your dad doesn't talk to me?

01:01:51.879 --> 01:01:54.609
This is way before I lost the house.

01:01:55.099 --> 01:01:57.369
When I was about your age...

01:01:57.469 --> 01:02:00.320
...I stole a bunch of money from my dad...

01:02:01.656 --> 01:02:03.962
...and I went to see the world.

01:02:04.062 --> 01:02:06.745
I wanted to have some fun.

01:02:07.795 --> 01:02:10.999
Prodigal son, the romanticism, that BS.

01:02:11.099 --> 01:02:13.462
The truth was, I was...

01:02:14.062 --> 01:02:17.513
...selfish, stupid.

01:02:18.839 --> 01:02:21.476
Then one night I called home...

01:02:21.576 --> 01:02:24.200
...and he said Dad's gone.

01:02:25.545 --> 01:02:27.608
Then when I got here, things...

01:02:29.483 --> 01:02:31.540
...were never the same.

01:02:33.086 --> 01:02:36.725
Well, I'm sure you did what you could.

01:02:36.825 --> 01:02:39.648
No. No, I did not.

01:02:41.128 --> 01:02:45.020
Because my brother needed me,
and I wasn't there.

01:02:48.502 --> 01:02:51.273
I was searching for all the wrong things.

01:02:52.273 --> 01:02:56.277
When you do that,
when your questions are all wrong...

01:02:56.377 --> 01:02:59.667
...you're just gonna miss
what it's all about.

01:03:00.447 --> 01:03:02.050
What what's all about?

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:05.841
The treasure that never runs dry.

01:03:14.528 --> 01:03:17.653
I had my shot, and I blew it.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.191
Don't.

01:03:45.025 --> 01:03:48.764
"Backstroke champion, Trent Walton."

01:04:21.962 --> 01:04:26.388
"Dear Andy, I'm sorry
I can't be the father you deserve."

01:04:28.035 --> 01:04:31.060
"You never should have come.
Forget about me."

01:04:40.647 --> 01:04:44.475
<i>"Dear Andy, if only I could find the words...</i>

01:04:44.575 --> 01:04:46.955
<i>"...or find the strength
to reach out to you...</i>

01:04:47.055 --> 01:04:50.224
<i>"...but I keep telling myself
that we will meet again someday.</i>

01:04:50.324 --> 01:04:51.914
<i>"Love always, Dad."</i>

01:05:26.259 --> 01:05:28.117
What is this?

01:05:45.312 --> 01:05:48.048
- Andy, open up.
- Andy, let me in!

01:05:48.148 --> 01:05:50.718
Open up! Op... hey!

01:05:50.818 --> 01:05:52.954
Andy! Andy, don't leave me!

01:05:53.054 --> 01:05:56.178
Andy, take me with you! Andy!

01:06:18.678 --> 01:06:21.437
Jim, you need to get out here.

01:06:22.415 --> 01:06:23.872
<i>Andy's gone.</i>

01:07:52.806 --> 01:07:55.364
West Forest compass roses.

01:09:20.227 --> 01:09:22.149
Two keys.

01:09:34.207 --> 01:09:35.796
Yeah.

01:09:38.277 --> 01:09:41.769
No, no, no, no! No! No!

01:09:44.651 --> 01:09:47.696
No! Hey! Hey!

01:09:49.423 --> 01:09:51.444
Hey! Anybody!

01:10:03.236 --> 01:10:04.872
Mark?

01:10:05.272 --> 01:10:08.009
Mark, do you read me? Come in.

01:10:08.109 --> 01:10:10.765
Mark, it's Andy. Are you there?

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.937
Does anybody read me?

01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:18.853
Can anybody read me?

01:10:18.953 --> 01:10:20.842
Help!

01:10:33.766 --> 01:10:37.034
Trent! Trent.

01:10:37.337 --> 01:10:39.427
Claire, what are you doing?

01:10:50.850 --> 01:10:53.931
Four days and you lost him
already, on an island?

01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:56.511
How'd you manage that, Trent?

01:10:58.825 --> 01:11:00.728
Trent, you explain to me how this happens.

01:11:00.828 --> 01:11:03.774
He's a 17-year-old kid.
You had one thing to do, look after him.

01:11:03.874 --> 01:11:06.495
- Spare me the parenting advice.
- Parent?

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:10.638
No, no, you lost the right to use that word
when you dropped him on my lap 15 years ago.

01:11:10.738 --> 01:11:12.834
I was his father, not you!
I picked up the pieces.

01:11:12.934 --> 01:11:16.041
- Pour it on, pour it on, pour it on.
- You feel sorry for yourself now?

01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:18.412
Why don't you grow up? You had
the chance. You didn't want to do that.

01:11:18.512 --> 01:11:21.615
You brought him here!
You brought him here, not me!

01:11:21.715 --> 01:11:23.888
- He was not supposed to know about me.
- Enough!

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:25.820
- None!
- Enough!

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:29.557
Trent, you know the island.

01:11:29.657 --> 01:11:31.425
Where could he have gone?

01:11:32.225 --> 01:11:33.868
I know.

01:11:39.032 --> 01:11:42.069
They're not just watches. They're riddles.

01:11:42.569 --> 01:11:44.770
Your father left you both a message.

01:11:47.073 --> 01:11:49.110
I never knew there were two.

01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:53.948
The answers lead to your father's fortune.
That's where they went.

01:11:54.048 --> 01:11:55.716
What do you mean, that's where they went?

01:11:55.816 --> 01:11:57.505
Claire.

01:11:59.686 --> 01:12:01.276
Where are they?

01:12:02.156 --> 01:12:04.358
<i>They went to the West Forest.</i>

01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:07.349
<i>He took my truck.
We'll need to get there by boat.</i>

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.057
If anybody's listening...

01:12:18.805 --> 01:12:20.862
...this is Andrew Walton...

01:12:21.908 --> 01:12:25.600
...son of Trent Walton...

01:12:29.015 --> 01:12:31.126
...brother to no one.

01:12:34.187 --> 01:12:36.077
And now I'm here...

01:12:38.157 --> 01:12:42.129
...underground, where nobody can find me.

01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:44.559
I made it all this way...

01:12:45.805 --> 01:12:47.655
...for a dead end.

01:12:52.539 --> 01:12:54.429
A dead end.

01:13:05.919 --> 01:13:08.343
<i>Andy, come in. What's your 10-9?</i>

01:13:09.288 --> 01:13:11.792
Mark? Mark, is that you?

01:13:11.892 --> 01:13:14.929
Mark! Mark! That's you!

01:13:15.029 --> 01:13:18.123
- <i>Andy, where the heck are you?</i>
- I'm underneath you.

01:13:18.223 --> 01:13:21.869
I'm underneath you. Do you see the remote
that we stole from Broman's? Do you see it?

01:13:21.969 --> 01:13:25.994
- <i>The black flashy thing?</i>
- Yes! Yes! Okay, push the button.

01:13:28.408 --> 01:13:30.344
Mark! Mark?

01:13:30.444 --> 01:13:32.768
- Andy!
- Mark!

01:13:33.746 --> 01:13:35.603
You came for me.

01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:39.428
Why did you leave without me?

01:13:41.588 --> 01:13:44.345
I found out why
I've never heard of Uncle Trent.

01:13:45.324 --> 01:13:47.149
I saw the bottles.

01:13:50.197 --> 01:13:52.453
Hey, hey.

01:13:52.899 --> 01:13:55.043
So what?

01:13:56.302 --> 01:13:58.806
No matter what Trent wrote...

01:13:59.106 --> 01:14:01.996
...we'll always be brothers.

01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:14.288
Now, come on, brother,
let's see what's down there.

01:14:14.388 --> 01:14:17.746
No. Mark, Mark, it's a dead end. Mark!

01:14:31.571 --> 01:14:35.096
You know my favorite time
I remember being your brother?

01:14:35.642 --> 01:14:38.645
The time we went on
this crazy treasure hunt...

01:14:38.745 --> 01:14:41.166
...that led us to a cave holding millions.

01:14:42.616 --> 01:14:45.052
Till we got stuck
'cause we were missing a key.

01:14:45.152 --> 01:14:48.009
Well, that's not how I remember it.

01:14:53.192 --> 01:14:56.485
Well, only one way to find out.

01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:59.333
Okay, ready?

01:14:59.733 --> 01:15:03.791
Three, two, one.

01:15:27.293 --> 01:15:29.184
Organ pipes?

01:15:30.897 --> 01:15:32.921
It's just for spooks.

01:15:33.666 --> 01:15:35.440
But why?

01:15:38.804 --> 01:15:40.675
That's why.

01:15:41.475 --> 01:15:43.245
It's a mine, Mark.

01:15:46.713 --> 01:15:48.803
It's a gold mine.

01:15:52.451 --> 01:15:55.328
That is what he meant when he said,
a treasure that would never run dry."

01:16:09.702 --> 01:16:11.960
Look! There's a way out!

01:16:24.884 --> 01:16:28.553
- If the fall didn't kill you...
- Those currents would certainly do the rest.

01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:33.147
Come on.

01:16:38.898 --> 01:16:40.822
This is a nice one.

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.809
"Broman."

01:16:49.409 --> 01:16:50.878
"Broman."

01:16:50.978 --> 01:16:54.469
Broman. He found out
there was gold on this island.

01:17:03.356 --> 01:17:05.246
"Trent and Jim."

01:17:11.230 --> 01:17:13.627
"Boys, if you're reading this,
you're together again...

01:17:13.727 --> 01:17:17.492
"...and you've discovered the real
treasure that will never run dry...

01:17:17.592 --> 01:17:18.969
"...love.

01:17:19.506 --> 01:17:23.856
"Take care of each other, Dad.
P.S. you're rich."

01:17:25.379 --> 01:17:27.675
Nice job, boys...

01:17:28.012 --> 01:17:30.315
...but I believe your work here is done.

01:17:32.051 --> 01:17:33.842
Step aside.

01:17:48.601 --> 01:17:51.171
You have to appreciate the irony.

01:17:51.271 --> 01:17:53.436
Richard Walton's grandsons...

01:17:53.536 --> 01:17:56.410
...lead me to the treasure
I could never find...

01:17:56.964 --> 01:17:59.531
...and now I'm going to use it...

01:17:59.631 --> 01:18:01.924
...to sweep his family aside for good.

01:18:02.182 --> 01:18:06.286
What is your deal?
What is your vendetta against my family?

01:18:06.386 --> 01:18:08.876
Your grandfather cheated me.

01:18:10.256 --> 01:18:12.526
I processed all of his gold...

01:18:13.026 --> 01:18:16.497
...and never once
did he cut me into the deal.

01:18:16.897 --> 01:18:18.781
I made him rich...

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:22.407
...and he gave me nothing.

01:18:23.769 --> 01:18:26.040
He didn't just disappear, did he?

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.810
You certified all the gold
that he brought in...

01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:32.379
...so you followed him out one night...

01:18:32.479 --> 01:18:35.115
<i>...probably foggy, nobody around...</i>

01:18:35.215 --> 01:18:38.239
...and you made sure
that nobody ever found his body.

01:18:43.222 --> 01:18:45.892
Well, that's an outrageous accusation...

01:18:45.992 --> 01:18:48.116
...and one that will never hold up in court.

01:19:02.074 --> 01:19:04.131
What have you done?

01:19:07.213 --> 01:19:09.783
"Riches you may possess...

01:19:09.883 --> 01:19:13.387
"...but only the hand of a Walton
shall grant release."

01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:14.776
What does that mean?

01:19:19.292 --> 01:19:21.182
What does it mean?

01:19:22.695 --> 01:19:24.584
Tell me!

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.698
What's this?

01:19:38.711 --> 01:19:40.969
Is this the key to getting us out of here?

01:19:45.150 --> 01:19:47.321
You know what the funny thing is?

01:19:47.421 --> 01:19:50.000
Only one of us knows how to use that thing.

01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:52.592
The other doesn't have a clue.

01:19:52.692 --> 01:19:55.829
Enough. I'm not asking you to open it.

01:19:56.429 --> 01:19:59.092
- I'm telling you.
- No, Broman.

01:19:59.937 --> 01:20:01.657
I'm telling you.

01:20:01.757 --> 01:20:06.450
You have screwed over my family
for three generations.

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:08.842
Now your run ends here.

01:20:09.042 --> 01:20:10.711
It ends with us.

01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:14.081
That's very brave, taking a stand.

01:20:14.581 --> 01:20:17.672
Unfortunately, that's not how you negotiate.

01:20:18.684 --> 01:20:21.342
This is how you negotiate.

01:20:26.992 --> 01:20:28.692
- You can't shoot me.
- No?

01:20:28.792 --> 01:20:31.052
You need the hand of a Walton.

01:20:33.866 --> 01:20:35.523
True.

01:20:36.335 --> 01:20:38.226
But I only need one.

01:20:39.373 --> 01:20:41.175
Mark!

01:20:58.524 --> 01:21:01.216
You picked wrong.

01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:16.964
Oh, God!

01:21:27.953 --> 01:21:30.023
Trent, there's something in the water!

01:21:30.123 --> 01:21:33.093
There! There! You see it? Something there?

01:21:34.093 --> 01:21:35.816
Andy!

01:21:39.031 --> 01:21:41.623
Andy! Andy!

01:21:43.135 --> 01:21:46.134
- Andy, help! Help me!
- There!

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:47.895
Help!

01:21:48.941 --> 01:21:52.333
- You gotta slow down!
- Help me!

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:14.035
He went down! He went under!

01:22:15.201 --> 01:22:17.891
Take the wheel. Take the wheel!

01:22:20.739 --> 01:22:23.977
We're not gonna be able to swim to the
surface, so you're gonna have to pull us up.

01:23:23.869 --> 01:23:27.336
Come on, come on! Come on! Come on!

01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:31.645
Wake up! Wake up! Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:23:31.745 --> 01:23:34.646
Who do you think you are, my father?

01:23:36.115 --> 01:23:38.171
Come on, wake up!

01:23:40.286 --> 01:23:43.157
I was searching for all the wrong things.

01:23:43.657 --> 01:23:48.015
When you do that,
you're just gonna miss what it's all about.

01:23:57.336 --> 01:24:00.428
I had my shot, and I blew it.

01:25:31.730 --> 01:25:34.155
I wish I was better with words.

01:25:36.835 --> 01:25:41.562
I was just so messed up
when your mom got sick.

01:25:43.142 --> 01:25:46.000
I was lost. Just...

01:25:48.948 --> 01:25:51.008
And then Jim and Sally...

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:54.710
...stepped in, thankfully.

01:25:56.588 --> 01:26:00.440
I figured you were better off if I was dead.

01:26:02.328 --> 01:26:03.918
And I was.

01:26:06.365 --> 01:26:08.255
And then you came.

01:26:12.304 --> 01:26:14.576
I guess I don't understand.

01:26:15.033 --> 01:26:16.676
I mean...

01:26:16.776 --> 01:26:20.635
...why go through the trouble of writing
all those letters and never send them?

01:26:23.115 --> 01:26:25.581
I guess I thought that if I...

01:26:26.428 --> 01:26:29.477
...wrote 'em and sent 'em out,
somehow you'd feel me.

01:26:30.989 --> 01:26:33.681
The idea of it anyway.

01:26:35.928 --> 01:26:38.018
I'm not an idea.

01:26:38.464 --> 01:26:40.154
I'm right here.

01:26:41.433 --> 01:26:43.878
So, if you wanna love me, then love me.

01:26:51.643 --> 01:26:53.333
Okay.

01:27:09.461 --> 01:27:11.932
<i>That day, it was finally clear to me...</i>

01:27:13.032 --> 01:27:17.508
<i>...that my grandfather had put together
the final treasure hunt...</i>

01:27:19.371 --> 01:27:21.996
<i>...just to bring his sons
back together again...</i>

01:27:23.775 --> 01:27:27.048
<i>...to see the Waltons side by side...</i>

01:27:27.748 --> 01:27:31.439
<i>...sharing the treasure that never runs dry.</i>

01:27:32.305 --> 01:27:38.687
