00:46.359 --> 00:49.000
Here you are, Mr Rebhun.
Another scotch and soda.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
(chuckles) The only way to fly.

00:56.640 --> 01:01.000
I used to be just like you. Used to hate flying.

01:01.159 --> 01:07.000
The moment I got on the plane, I'd grip those
armrests like my teeth were being drilled.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.000
But, statistically, you could fly every day...

01:10.359 --> 01:14.000
...for the next 26,000 years
before you'd have an accident.

01:14.439 --> 01:16.000
Do you believe that?

01:34.359 --> 01:36.000
{y:i}(unbuckles seat belt)

02:24.639 --> 02:26.000
{y:i}(loud bang)

02:28.120 --> 02:30.000
Ooh, baby! Settle down.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.000
{y:i}- (beeping)
- What the hell is this?

02:33.960 --> 02:36.000
{y:i}(passengers panicking)

02:42.439 --> 02:43.000
{y:i}(screaming)

04:05.319 --> 04:09.000
? Happy birthday to you

04:09.759 --> 04:13.000
? Happy birthday to you

04:13.879 --> 04:19.000
- ? Happy birthday, dear Dana
- ? Agent Scully

04:19.480 --> 04:24.000
? Happy birthday to you

04:25.120 --> 04:27.000
I didn't know it was your birthday, Scully.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Mulder, you have never remembered my
birthday in the four years I've known you.

04:39.199 --> 04:43.000
That's how I like to celebrate 'em,
every four years. It's like dog years that way.

04:43.759 --> 04:46.000
- Dog years? Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.000
Oh, I got something for you.

04:49.839 --> 04:52.000
You've got to be kidding me.

04:52.720 --> 04:55.000
- Something that reminded me of you.
- An alien implant?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Two, actually. I made 'em into earrings.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.000
Apollo 11.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.000
Read the back.

05:10.399 --> 05:14.000
Commemorating Apollo 11
and the mission to the moon. July, 1969.

05:16.199 --> 05:18.000
- I'm touched.
- It's, um...

05:18.790 --> 05:20.000
Excuse me, are you Scully and Mulder?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.000
Promise me
this isn't gonna be embarrassing.

05:23.790 --> 05:29.000
My name is Sharon Grafia. I was asked
to find you if something happened.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.000
Excuse me?

05:30.240 --> 05:35.000
You have no reason to believe me, but
my brother said you'd understand what to do.

05:35.439 --> 05:37.000
- About what?
- If he didn't make it.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.000
- Excuse me. Who are you talking about?
- Max. Max Fennig.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.000
He was on his way here to deliver something
that made him fear for his life.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.000
Something he said the government
would kill for.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.000
But his plane, it went down two hours ago.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.000
What we know right now
is that the plane designated as Flight 549...

06:00.319 --> 06:04.000
...lost radio contact
tonight at 1900 hours EDT...

06:04.160 --> 06:07.000
...and subsequently crashed
into a wooded area...

06:07.790 --> 06:10.000
...approximately 30 miles
from Albany, New York.

06:10.279 --> 06:16.000
Local law enforcement and EMTs have been
on the scene forjust under two hours...

06:16.199 --> 06:19.000
...but initial reports are
they've found no survivors...

06:19.560 --> 06:24.000
...of the 134 passengers and crew
listed on the manifest.

06:24.560 --> 06:28.000
I wish we had more information
about the crash site...

06:28.199 --> 06:32.000
...but darkness and the terrain
will make it slow going until morning.

06:32.600 --> 06:37.000
We have a tape of the last radio exchange
before 549 went down.

06:37.639 --> 06:43.000
But I wanna stress the need to keep
everything you know within the Go Team...

06:43.560 --> 06:47.000
...so that all information to the press
comes from the llC.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.000
- You cued up, John?
- (man) Ready.

06:49.720 --> 06:53.000
{y:i}(pilot) Copy, Tower. Please advise.
{y:i}Do you see a need to adjust?

06:53.920 --> 06:57.000
{y:i}(Tower) Negative.
{y:i}Steady air speed of two-niner-six knots.

06:57.399 --> 07:01.000
{y:i}Maintain heading one-zero-zero
{y:i}at two-niner thousand feet.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.000
{y:i}Go ahead, 549.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.000
{y:i}- (beeping)
{y:i}- (pilot) What the hell is this?

07:06.790 --> 07:07.000
{y:i}(Tower) 549, do you read?

07:07.959 --> 07:11.000
{y:i}(pilot) We've got something, some intercept.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.000
{y:i}My God! My God!

07:13.879 --> 07:15.000
{y:i}Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

07:17.759 --> 07:19.000
And that's all she wrote.

07:19.680 --> 07:25.000
Controllers tried to raise 549 on all
frequencies but the pilots did not respond.

07:25.120 --> 07:28.000
We've got an FAA charter leaving in an hour.

07:28.439 --> 07:30.000
Excuse me. I'm Agent Mulder with the FBI.

07:30.680 --> 07:35.000
Is there any indication or suspicion
that Flight 549 may have been forced down?

07:36.400 --> 07:39.000
- Forced down?
- The pilot said intercept on the recording.

07:39.959 --> 07:44.000
We have no data to support that.
No confirmation of other aircraft in the area.

07:45.519 --> 07:48.000
- Unless you have something.
- No. But a passenger...

07:48.800 --> 07:53.000
...was well-known to our government
as an alien abductee.

07:53.399 --> 07:54.000
{y:i}(murmuring)

07:54.879 --> 07:57.000
- An alien abductee?
- A man named Max Fennig.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
A multiple-abduction victim,
known as a repeater.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.000
{y:i}(murmuring continues)

08:02.560 --> 08:04.000
Hold on. Can I have some quiet?

08:04.480 --> 08:06.000
He predicted the accident.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.000
The plane may have been forced down.

08:08.879 --> 08:12.000
- Forced down by who, or what?
- I'm hesitant to speculate.

08:13.790 --> 08:15.000
- Mulder, your name's Mulder?
- Yes, sir.

08:15.519 --> 08:19.000
I've been doing this for 18 years.
I thought I'd heard everything.

08:19.879 --> 08:24.000
I'm looking through the manifest
and there was no one named Max Fennig.

08:24.680 --> 08:28.000
There may be people
who want to cover up this evidence.

08:28.360 --> 08:32.000
Agent Mulder, is this an official FBI position?

08:34.159 --> 08:34.799
No, sir.

08:34.879 --> 08:38.000
What you're suggesting
trivialises this tragedy...

08:38.279 --> 08:43.000
...and casts these people and the work they
do in a light you'd be advised to avoid.

08:43.720 --> 08:48.000
We all share the same goal here -
to find out what caused that plane to crash.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.000
And if any of the capable people
in this room...

08:50.840 --> 08:54.000
...find Dr Spock's phaser
or any green alien goo...

08:55.600 --> 08:58.000
...we'll be sure to give you all the credit.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.000
All right, then.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
You sure know how to make
a girl feel special on her birthday.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.000
Have you ever seen anything like this?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.000
Where's the plane?

10:26.960 --> 10:32.000
(Scully) They think it hit the ground at over
300 miles an hour on a vertical descent.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.000
Meteorological data is being analysed...

10:35.679 --> 10:40.000
...and so far they are attributing the crash
to weather phenomenon -

10:40.360 --> 10:44.000
...to a rapid depressurisation caused by
something called a wind rotor...

10:44.960 --> 10:47.000
...coming off the Adirondacks.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.000
But not to Max Fennig.

10:49.159 --> 10:52.000
Even if he was on this flight,
he'd be in a hundred pieces.

10:52.919 --> 10:56.000
They'll be lucky if they can ID
half the bodies they find.

10:56.159 --> 10:58.000
He was on this flight. I'm sure of that.

10:58.440 --> 11:02.000
Well, say we do find him.
What's that gonna prove?

11:04.390 --> 11:06.000
I don't know.

11:06.799 --> 11:10.000
Maybe that one man's life
was worth sacrificing 133 others.

12:42.879 --> 12:44.000
Is that a hand?

12:47.399 --> 12:49.000
- Is that a watch?
- Yeah.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.000
What does it read?

12:51.960 --> 12:54.000
- 8.01.
- So does this one.

12:54.159 --> 12:57.000
What are they listing
as the time of the crash?

12:57.240 --> 12:59.000
Uh, 7.52 pm.

13:01.279 --> 13:03.000
- Nine minutes' difference.
- Gotta be a mistake.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Nine minutes, Scully. Do you remember
the last time you were missing nine minutes?

13:08.759 --> 13:10.000
No one reported the plane on radar.

13:10.879 --> 13:14.000
They're estimating
until they recover the data recorder.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, something just occurred to me.

13:16.679 --> 13:17.000
What?

13:17.879 --> 13:22.000
- I don't think we'll find Max Fennig.
- You were certain he was on this flight.

13:22.279 --> 13:25.000
I doubt he finished the flight
with the other passengers.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.000
(man shouting) Hey!
Get me a medic over here!

13:28.720 --> 13:33.000
This man's alive! This man's alive!
Get me a medic over here! Somebody!

13:35.120 --> 13:41.000
We need an airlift to a burn unit!
This man needs oxygen and a saline IV!

13:41.159 --> 13:43.000
Sir, can you hear me?

13:45.200 --> 13:46.000
Sir?

14:11.480 --> 14:13.000
I've got what you asked for.

14:16.759 --> 14:20.000
- All of those are from Max?
- Every letter he ever wrote me.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.000
You said to bring everything I had.

14:22.360 --> 14:25.000
We believe there are things
you haven't told us.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.000
- We need to know everything.
- About what?

14:27.799 --> 14:30.000
About Max - where he's been,
where he's travelled.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.000
What it was he was carrying on that flight.

14:33.679 --> 14:35.000
- Did you find Max?
- No.

14:35.279 --> 14:39.000
But we found a passenger
with severe burns, severe cellular damage.

14:39.559 --> 14:43.000
Burns that suggest the victim
was exposed to a high level of radiation.

14:43.519 --> 14:46.000
- Something Max was carrying?
- We need to know what that was.

14:46.759 --> 14:51.000
If you're withholding any information,
there could be severe consequences.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.000
Mulder?

14:56.120 --> 15:00.000
Man's name was Larold Rebhun.
The manifest has him in seat 13D...

15:00.200 --> 15:05.000
...which is the aisle seat right here. My guess
is that Max Fennig was in 13F, window seat.

15:05.799 --> 15:08.000
The manifest had a passenger in that seat...

15:08.200 --> 15:12.000
Paul Gidney - an alias Max used
in his letters when he went underground.

15:12.519 --> 15:17.000
He used another alias to get ajob at the
Rocky Flats Environmental Energy Site...

15:17.960 --> 15:21.000
...where they store weapons-grade plutonium.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.000
Do you think Max was carrying plutonium?

15:24.840 --> 15:28.000
The burns on that passenger's face
were deep-tissue radiation burns.

15:28.759 --> 15:31.000
I don't know how else
he might have gotten them.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.000
- What'd Max be doing with that?
- I don't know.

15:33.799 --> 15:37.000
He wrote maybe a thousand letters
describing his abductions...

15:37.720 --> 15:42.000
...but in January he started
making vague references to a theft.

15:42.240 --> 15:45.000
Now, it seems to me
that he started to get the idea...

15:45.440 --> 15:48.000
...that he'd come on to something
that was very dangerous.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.000
So what caused this crash?

15:52.120 --> 15:56.000
If he was carrying fissile plutonium
and it became exposed in the cabin...

15:56.879 --> 16:00.000
...it very conceivably
could have caused the crash.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.000
You wanna know what I think, Scully?

16:03.800 --> 16:05.000
- I'm gonna tell you.
{y:i}- (instrument clicking)

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
I think Max was abducted,
sucked right out of this door at 29,000 feet.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.000
The burns are a result of that abduction.

16:13.390 --> 16:18.000
All the evidence will point to this, but will
be dismissed because of its unthinkability.

16:18.519 --> 16:22.000
The crash of Flight 549
will go unsolved unless we prove it.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.000
When Max is returned, he'll tell us the same
story unless someone gets to him first.

16:26.399 --> 16:29.000
Mulder, Max is returned.
I found out a few minutes ago.

16:29.759 --> 16:33.000
They found his body a short way
from the wreckage earlier today.

16:35.159 --> 16:36.000
You're positive?

16:36.480 --> 16:39.000
Travelling under the name Paul Gidney,
seat 13F...

16:39.960 --> 16:42.000
...with the same burns as his seat-mate.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.000
Still no explanation for this crash.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.000
{y:i}(clock ticking)

17:10.680 --> 17:12.000
{y:i}(clock stops)

17:12.319 --> 17:13.000
{y:i}(rumbling)

17:24.920 --> 17:26.000
{y:i}(gasps)

17:27.279 --> 17:29.000
{y:i}(screams)

18:14.390 --> 18:16.000
{y:i}(sobbing)

19:16.559 --> 19:20.000
...to make a determination
as to whether there was an explosion...

19:20.839 --> 19:22.000
...pre-impact or as we can see...

19:26.319 --> 19:29.000
The data only points to an explosion
after the aircraft...

19:31.160 --> 19:34.000
Did you make a positive ID on Max Fennig?

19:35.790 --> 19:39.000
They've located the cockpit voice recorder
and the flight data recorder.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.000
And?

19:40.119 --> 19:44.000
The llC is saying that there was a complete
systems malfunction on the plane.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.000
So still no explanation
for what brought it down.

19:48.790 --> 19:51.000
Not yet, but they are looking
at the emergency exit door.

19:51.680 --> 19:56.000
And while they cannot explain the radiation,
they are not ready to attribute it as the cause.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Not able to, or not willing to?

19:58.960 --> 20:02.000
- Why can't you just accept the facts?
- There are no facts.

20:02.319 --> 20:07.000
What they're gonna report, they're the
opposite of facts. An ignorance of the facts.

20:07.279 --> 20:11.000
Claimed steadfastly, ignorance
becomes as acceptable as the truth.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.000
What would you like them to report?

20:13.680 --> 20:17.000
That there is not one wristwatch
on any of the bodies. They've been stolen.

20:17.960 --> 20:21.000
- These men are covering evidence?
- These men? No.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.000
These men are trained
to identify moving parts...

20:25.390 --> 20:28.000
...to reconstruct them in the past
and arrive at the present.

20:28.319 --> 20:32.000
But they can't do that
because somebody has stolen the past.

20:32.160 --> 20:37.000
Nine minutes of it that became a lifetime for
those passengers and now for their families.

20:37.440 --> 20:40.000
Someone has to find out
what happened in those nine minutes.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.000
Somehow, we've got to get that back.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.000
Louis Frish?

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Yes, sir. CO said you were coming out
with some questions.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.000
Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.

21:16.359 --> 21:20.000
If you're here about the crash,
I already told the NTSB guys what I know.

21:20.960 --> 21:24.000
- They were already out here?
- Yes, ma'am. Night of the crash.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.000
Were you in the tower that night?

21:26.880 --> 21:29.000
Yes, sir. Me and Sergeant Armando Gonzales.

21:29.519 --> 21:32.000
- Did Flight 549 show up on your radar?
- Yes, sir.

21:32.599 --> 21:35.000
- Did you establish radio contact?
- No, sir.

21:35.519 --> 21:39.000
We wouldn't contact an airliner
unless it came into military airspace.

21:39.880 --> 21:45.000
- Would there be a record of 549 in the log?
- Yes, sir. I know it by heart.

21:45.519 --> 21:50.000
At 19.52 Flight 549 dropped from
an altitude of 29,000 feet.

21:50.599 --> 21:54.000
About 45 seconds later,
we got an altitude reading of triple-X.

21:55.599 --> 21:59.000
I've never seen anything like it.
Hope to never again.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.000
Then what did you do?

22:01.240 --> 22:06.000
We called 549 and got no response.
Then we called ATC in Albany.

22:06.790 --> 22:10.000
- What was their response?
- We just gave them the information.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.000
Is there something else you're looking for?

22:15.200 --> 22:17.000
About nine minutes.

22:18.519 --> 22:20.000
We've been travelling a long way.

22:29.790 --> 22:32.000
The initial report said there was
no radar confirmation of the crash.

22:32.599 --> 22:35.000
That must have come after our briefing.

22:52.599 --> 22:54.000
What did you tell them?

22:54.519 --> 22:56.000
What I was supposed to say.

22:56.720 --> 22:59.000
Somebody's gonna figure out
what's goin' on.

22:59.359 --> 23:01.000
I don't ask. I don't know.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.000
I don't wanna know.

23:03.880 --> 23:08.000
If they find out the truth, you think
anybody's gonna take the heat for us?

23:08.119 --> 23:10.000
I'm not the only liar here.

23:11.790 --> 23:16.000
If they come back to talk to me, I'm tellin'
the truth. I'm not gonna have no blood on me.

23:16.279 --> 23:19.000
Then you make me the liar.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.000
- Did they find her?
- No, ma'am.

23:46.759 --> 23:51.000
- We need answers. The place is a mess.
- We'll do our best, ma'am.

23:51.279 --> 23:54.000
- Hey, you're gonna have to take care of this.
- Excuse me?

23:54.799 --> 23:58.000
The room you rented for the woman?
She trashed it and split.

23:58.319 --> 24:01.000
- Sharon Grafia?
- It was under your name.

24:01.599 --> 24:05.000
Look at this! I don't know what kind of game
she was playin' in here.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.000
She blew the door right out of the jamb.

24:11.599 --> 24:14.000
I doubt insurance will cover it.

24:17.839 --> 24:20.000
Does your policy
cover the acts of extraterrestrials?

24:20.759 --> 24:23.000
- We'll take care of it.
- Great.

24:24.240 --> 24:27.000
Hit me with your best shot.
What do you think happened?

24:27.519 --> 24:28.000
I haven't a clue.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
It looks like this place fell from 29,000 feet.

24:31.920 --> 24:35.000
- You think Max's sister...
- Was abducted, just like Max.

24:35.359 --> 24:37.000
Maybe it runs in the family.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.000
What happened here?

24:39.799 --> 24:42.000
You're the experts.
Bring your team down and work it out.

24:42.880 --> 24:46.000
- They're hands are full.
- Producing inconclusive evidence.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.000
I've come to tell you
we've found some evidence.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.000
- About what caused the crash?
- Possibly.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.000
- But I'm not ready to announce it.
- Why not?

24:55.390 --> 24:57.000
I'm afraid I'd sound as crazy as you.

24:58.400 --> 25:02.000
Is there someplace I can show you these?
Someplace with a door?

25:04.599 --> 25:10.000
These lines you see here are fatigue cracks,
caused by cyclic stress on the fuselage.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.000
- From what?
- Wear and tear.

25:12.599 --> 25:15.000
Most commercial planes
have 30,000-hours flight time.

25:15.960 --> 25:19.000
Except 549 was a new plane.
549 had no wear and tear.

25:19.759 --> 25:22.000
- Then what caused that?
- I can't tell you.

25:22.319 --> 25:24.000
But I can tell you this.

25:24.240 --> 25:29.000
The way these cracks radiate looks like
the door's been shaken and blown outward...

25:29.640 --> 25:33.000
...straight off its frame.
Thanks to you, we knew what to look for.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.000
What you're describing
is physically impossible.

25:36.839 --> 25:40.000
In normal operation, it could never happen.
Not this way.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.000
But it did.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Hey, man, how ya doin'?

25:55.839 --> 26:00.000
Sorry about before.
It's, uh - I was way out of line.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.000
I just...

26:04.480 --> 26:07.000
I've just been letting this thing
get to me, I guess.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.000
Hey, Gonzales?

26:44.400 --> 26:47.000
- Did you find him, Sergeant?
- He's not up there.

27:05.279 --> 27:09.000
{y:i}(Tower) 35,000 feet. It's negligible.
{y:i}Nothing to be concerned about.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.000
{y:i}(pilot) Copy, Tower. Please advise.
{y:i}Do you see a need to adjust?

27:13.920 --> 27:17.000
{y:i}(Tower) Negative, 549.
{y:i}Steady air speed at two-niner-six knots.

27:17.359 --> 27:21.000
{y:i}Maintain heading one-zero-zero
{y:i}at two-niner thousand feet.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.000
{y:i}Go ahead, 549.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.000
{y:i}(pilot) What the hell is this?

27:26.240 --> 27:28.000
{y:i}(Tower) 549, do you read?

27:28.640 --> 27:31.000
{y:i}(pilot) We got something - some intercept.

27:32.390 --> 27:33.000
{y:i}My God! My God!

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
{y:i}Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

27:38.519 --> 27:39.000
{y:i}Scully.

27:39.599 --> 27:43.000
I just realised something. The air traffic
controller, I've heard him before.

27:43.839 --> 27:46.000
{y:i}We've been up for 36 hours. Can it wait?

27:46.200 --> 27:49.000
No, I know. I just need you
to come over and listen to this now.

27:49.839 --> 27:52.000
{y:i}I'm on my way.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.000
Don't scream. Just listen to me.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.000
Listen to me.

28:09.799 --> 28:14.000
I'm the man responsible.
I'm the one that caused that plane crash.

28:25.559 --> 28:27.000
Uh, give me a second.

28:31.359 --> 28:34.000
You said you had someone
with some information?

28:34.119 --> 28:36.000
This is Louis Frish. Sergeant Frish.

28:36.720 --> 28:42.000
He's the air traffic controller on the recording
you played for us the other night.

28:42.319 --> 28:44.000
That was from Albany Control Centre.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.000
It was the voice
of a civilian air traffic controller.

28:48.319 --> 28:49.000
No, sir.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.000
There seems to be a discrepancy.
What you've been led to believe...

28:53.200 --> 28:56.000
...was built on a lie Sgt Frish
was asked to perpetuate.

28:56.359 --> 28:58.000
Along with Sgt Gonzales, who is now dead.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
I was ordered to lie
about what happened to Flight 549.

29:03.240 --> 29:06.000
- By whom?
- My CO.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.000
Flight 549 appeared
on my radar at 1900 hours.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
We were asked to give
its coordinates at 15-second intervals.

29:12.839 --> 29:15.000
About two minutes past 30 degrees north...

29:15.480 --> 29:20.000
...we saw a second aircraft enter
549's airspace in an intercept pattern.

29:20.279 --> 29:22.000
It shadowed 549 for another ten minutes...

29:22.799 --> 29:25.000
...before we were asked
to give new coordinates.

29:25.640 --> 29:31.000
A few seconds later, there was an explosion
and 549 disappeared from my radar screen.

29:34.519 --> 29:36.000
I don't believe this man.

29:36.519 --> 29:39.000
There's no forensic detail to support it.

29:39.790 --> 29:43.000
No sign of an explosion, no flashing,
no residues, no oxidation, nothing.

29:43.559 --> 29:49.000
I'm telling you what I saw. We shot down
a civilian jet, knowingly and willingly.

29:50.319 --> 29:53.000
I'll tell you something.
I have a responsibility to the truth.

29:53.759 --> 29:54.000
So do we.

29:54.559 --> 29:58.000
This man can't testify to this story,
not without evidence.

29:58.240 --> 30:02.000
- The military's covering up that evidence.
- The story makes no sense.

30:02.319 --> 30:05.000
Unless the aircraft that was fired on
never appeared on his radar.

30:06.160 --> 30:11.000
A third, unidentified aircraft engaged
the civilian jet, which the sergeant never saw.

30:11.279 --> 30:12.000
A stealth aircraft?

30:12.480 --> 30:17.000
Shot down by the intercept aircraft, which
may have caused the crash of Flight 549...

30:17.279 --> 30:22.000
...which means the cause of this crash is
out there somewhere at a second crash site.

30:22.240 --> 30:25.000
- Somebody would've spotted it.
- They didn't know about it.

30:25.720 --> 30:30.000
Except the military. His life is in danger
because he can put the pieces together.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.000
Then somebody
has to get him someplace safe.

30:37.790 --> 30:39.000
Lfthere's a second crash site...

30:41.119 --> 30:43.000
...let's find it.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.000
Mulder.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.000
Hold on.

32:02.599 --> 32:03.000
Mulder?

32:05.359 --> 32:08.000
- Louis, help me.
- Don't take your foot off the gas.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.000
- Is he gonna see us?
- No. We gotta get under it.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.000
We're not gonna make it.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.000
(sobbing) Somebody help me!

34:24.559 --> 34:25.000
Please!

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Who's there?

34:31.599 --> 34:35.000
Oh, don't... don't let them take me again!

34:53.790 --> 34:54.000
Louis!

34:54.480 --> 34:56.000
Louis! I wanna ask you something.

35:00.280 --> 35:03.000
This is where Flight 549 went down.

35:03.239 --> 35:06.000
There's been no substantiation
of a second crash site?

35:07.000 --> 35:07.000
Right.

35:07.880 --> 35:12.000
What if that's because that second aircraft
never fell to the ground?

35:14.390 --> 35:16.000
It came down somewhere around here.

35:16.320 --> 35:19.000
- In Great Sacandaga lake?
- Yeah.

35:19.119 --> 35:21.000
Travelling north to south, 15 degrees.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.000
It's a shallower descent.
Yeah, that's very possible.

35:25.239 --> 35:27.000
Possible?

35:27.119 --> 35:30.000
Are you OK
taking Sergeant Frish back to DC?

35:30.790 --> 35:32.000
- By myself?
- Yeah.

35:32.360 --> 35:35.000
- You just let me know what's going on.
- As soon as I know.

36:17.559 --> 36:20.000
- I saw the sign. Are you Bearfeld?
- Yeah.

36:20.840 --> 36:24.000
- I stopped by your place. Nobody was home.
- Who are you?

36:24.119 --> 36:26.000
Fox Mulder. I'm with the FBI.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.000
You to do with what's going on out there?

36:30.320 --> 36:32.000
What's going on out there?

36:32.320 --> 36:37.000
Some kind of search-and-rescue operation
or some damn thing. I don't know.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Where?

36:39.800 --> 36:41.000
Out over Democrat Point.

36:41.920 --> 36:45.000
Some kind of hovering lights,
just there and then gone.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.000
Can you show me?

36:49.800 --> 36:52.000
No, no, no. I need you to take me there.

36:56.320 --> 36:59.000
- I'm just gonna get some things.
- Where then?

37:00.360 --> 37:03.000
I'm gonna ask for some kind
of protective arrangement.

37:03.840 --> 37:07.000
I need to talk to my agent in charge
to get a feel for how to go on this...

37:07.679 --> 37:11.000
...but I think you're gonna
want to talk to the right people.

37:11.280 --> 37:14.000
- Do you think I'll be prosecuted?
- For what?

37:14.519 --> 37:17.000
I gave the coordinates.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.000
You didn't bring that plane down, Louis.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
I lied. I misled a federal investigator.
I misled you.

37:26.390 --> 37:30.000
134 people,
Sergeant Gonzales - they're all dead.

37:30.239 --> 37:34.000
- It wasn't your fault.
- But I'm gonna have to live with it.

37:36.239 --> 37:39.000
I watched that plane fall out of the sky.

37:39.790 --> 37:42.000
It was just a dot on the screen,
just a set of numbers.

37:43.790 --> 37:46.000
The wreckage -
I can't get that out of my mind.

37:47.440 --> 37:49.000
How those people died.

37:49.679 --> 37:53.000
How easy it is to lie.
Just to say it was a dot on the screen.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.000
Until you see it.

38:00.960 --> 38:03.000
Look, I can't tell you how to feel, Louis.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
But I can tell you
that I will do everything I can...

38:06.880 --> 38:11.000
...to make sure you tell your story
to somebody who will do the right thing.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Yeah. Thank you.

38:16.790 --> 38:18.000
Do you think it's safe to make a phone call?

38:19.159 --> 38:22.000
I'd like to tell my girlfriend
that I'm... whatever.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.000
Yeah. Um...

38:25.599 --> 38:27.000
...just tell her you're OK.

38:34.360 --> 38:35.000
(Mulder) Over there.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.000
- How deep is it here?
- Fifty. Sixty, maybe.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Have you worked at this depth before?

38:54.360 --> 38:56.000
Not exactly.

38:56.199 --> 38:58.000
What exactly is your experience?

38:58.760 --> 39:03.000
Once I, uh, I got a quarter off of
the deep end at the Y pool.

39:09.790 --> 39:10.000
Last call, folks.

39:10.960 --> 39:12.000
- Cocktail?
- No. No, thanks.

39:17.280 --> 39:22.000
We're being met by a federal marshal.
You'll end up sleepin' in somebody's office.

39:22.119 --> 39:25.000
You wanna drink? You need a drink. Yes.

39:25.440 --> 39:29.000
- (bartender) There you are.
- (woman) Yeah. Thank you.

39:29.320 --> 39:33.000
- Hey! Birthday girl!
- Agent Pendrell. How ya doing?

39:33.760 --> 39:36.000
I have something for you.
Where've you been?

39:36.199 --> 39:39.000
- I've been, uh, gone.
- Oh. Uh, can I buy you a drink?

39:39.719 --> 39:42.000
No, you know, it's OK. I'm with somebody.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.000
Oh.

39:45.159 --> 39:48.000
(chuckles) Let me buy him a drink too.

39:48.639 --> 39:51.000
- No. You know what? It's OK.
- No. I insist.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.000
- Bartender? Bartender?
- Yeah?

39:53.239 --> 39:56.000
Set me up with a couple
of birthday-girl drinks here.

40:22.639 --> 40:24.000
Get down!

40:29.760 --> 40:31.000
{y:i}(screaming, shouting)

40:39.800 --> 40:43.000
{y:i}- (gasping)
- You've gotta keep breathing, Pendrell.

40:43.199 --> 40:45.000
Do you hear me?

42:31.360 --> 42:33.000
