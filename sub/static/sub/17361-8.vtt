WEBVTT

00:41.124 --> 00:47.120
(creaking)

01:01.811 --> 01:02.926
Maggie.

01:05.398 --> 01:06.979
Uh.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.857
I know people
are saying things--

01:10.028 --> 01:13.987
nice things
about you and Sasha, hmm?

01:16.076 --> 01:17.441
They are?

01:17.619 --> 01:18.984
They are.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.528
About the other night...

01:21.706 --> 01:23.822
about how they're thinking
you saved the place.

01:26.294 --> 01:28.626
Don't let it
go to your head.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.709
Well,
don't let it bother you.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.583
It seems like it bothers you.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.678
Mm.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.887
What you doing up there?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.521
You gonna eat that?

01:53.655 --> 01:55.065
Yes.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.825
Eduardo: Dude.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.903
You know she's pregnant.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.498
(crunches)

02:16.094 --> 02:18.005
(sighs)

02:25.311 --> 02:28.929
Against the grain, kid.

02:29.107 --> 02:32.895
Always against the grain.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.775
(chuckles)

02:59.637 --> 03:02.970
(door creaks lightly)

03:08.354 --> 03:09.469
(sniffing)

03:09.647 --> 03:10.807
Ah.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.722
Damn, that smells good.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.026
Mmm!

03:18.615 --> 03:19.775
Want a taste?

03:21.784 --> 03:23.991
(chuckles)

03:24.162 --> 03:25.447
Okay.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.034
(exhales deeply)

03:35.757 --> 03:38.248
Here's his damn lemonade.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.212
I had some in my kitchen.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.220
Denise liked it.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.852
Thank you.
(sniffles)

03:52.023 --> 03:53.103
Hey.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.982
Go home.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.939
(chucang)
Let me take over.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.439
No.
(sniffles)

04:02.617 --> 04:05.450
I'm fine.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.488
ltold Rick
I would watch Judith.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.156
I'm gonna do that.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.295
You should go.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.587
We're about to sit.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.925
(door creaks)

04:45.910 --> 04:47.650
(clicks tongue)

04:50.039 --> 04:51.700
We're gonna need
another setting.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.663
(sighs)

04:59.841 --> 05:01.547
(pitcher thumps lightly)

05:12.061 --> 05:14.393
(walkers growling)

05:17.066 --> 05:19.318
Today and only today,
right?

05:20.778 --> 05:22.518
Yeah.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.744
All these bullet holes--

05:28.911 --> 05:31.288
this'll take on water quick.

05:31.456 --> 05:36.246
(growling continues)

05:36.419 --> 05:39.377
We can probably make it
to the canoe.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.083
Probably.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.083
If you want
to stay back...

05:46.888 --> 05:48.924
I'm going to pretend
you didn't just say that.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.438
I'm seeing this through.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.605
We both are.

06:26.177 --> 06:30.090
(sighs)

06:33.684 --> 06:35.424
I'm not waiting for your dad
anymore.

06:35.603 --> 06:39.095
I don't know
where the hell he is,

06:39.273 --> 06:41.138
but Lucille...

06:45.571 --> 06:46.777
is hungry.

06:52.286 --> 06:55.653
Carl,
pass the rolls...

06:59.877 --> 07:01.037
please.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.999
(music playing)

07:45.173 --> 07:47.835
(gate clinking)

07:50.344 --> 07:52.471
(gate clanks shut)

07:58.436 --> 08:00.927
Gary:
Ohh. Look at that, huh?

08:01.105 --> 08:03.141
Easy as that.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.524
It's just a transaction.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.275
You look like shit,

08:08.446 --> 08:09.561
which means
you fought for this.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.229
So you did yourjobs.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.903
You get it,
and I like that.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.033
Negan likes that.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.452
That's good to hear.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.327
You play your cards right,

08:25.505 --> 08:28.542
maybe I'll show you
where we live.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.456
Maybe I'll buy you
a sandwich.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.131
Just tell me when.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.768
You like watching,
haircut?

08:42.939 --> 08:44.770
Yes.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.351
I mean...

08:46.526 --> 08:49.393
Laura: You mean
to get the hell out of here.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.776
Now!

09:06.337 --> 09:08.293
(light thump in distance)

09:27.525 --> 09:28.685
Morgan.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.528
It's just some things
from the Kingdom garden--

09:34.699 --> 09:37.532
some nectarines,
some apples.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.613
Thank you. lam good.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.118
You can fend for yourself,
I know,

09:41.289 --> 09:43.530
but fresh produce isn't
something you can just--

09:43.708 --> 09:44.823
Really.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.913
I'm good.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.165
(chuckles)

09:51.340 --> 09:53.001
Ezekiel?

09:53.175 --> 09:54.881
Apparently, some people are
having a hard time believing me

09:55.052 --> 09:57.634
when I say ljust want
to be left alone.

09:57.805 --> 10:01.047
You know, I was trying
to leave you alone, and I will.

10:01.225 --> 10:04.342
But you called me over.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.509
Why?

10:05.688 --> 10:06.768
How are you?

10:06.939 --> 10:09.316
Good.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.643
Good.

10:10.818 --> 10:11.978
Now you can go.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.393
(chuckles)

10:15.239 --> 10:17.104
I think you're going soft.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.819
I think you're going.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.153
(scoffs)

10:22.997 --> 10:24.578
(insects chirping)

10:24.749 --> 10:27.161
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.791
Richard: Carol, hi.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.998
I'm sorry to bother you.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.630
Morgan, M didn't expect you
to be here, too.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.212
It's good you are.

10:37.386 --> 10:38.887
I wanted to speak to you both,
actually.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.636
It's about
something important.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.223
(water splashing)

10:45.394 --> 10:48.807
Rick:
Almost at the canoe.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.642
(walkers growling)

10:50.816 --> 10:52.352
We're taking on water quick,
man.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.686
Aaron: I know.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.652
Rick, on the left!

11:04.830 --> 11:06.821
(growling continues)

11:13.923 --> 11:15.834
(grunts)

11:16.008 --> 11:18.385
(snarling)

11:18.552 --> 11:21.544
(growling continues)

11:28.979 --> 11:31.971
(both grunting)

11:35.861 --> 11:37.317
We're almost there.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.729
(grunts)

11:48.749 --> 11:50.034
- (growling)
- Whoa!

11:50.209 --> 11:51.915
Whoa! Whoa!

11:53.838 --> 11:55.829
No, no!

11:57.049 --> 11:59.040
- (thuds)
- on!

12:01.512 --> 12:03.878
Hold on!

12:04.056 --> 12:05.466
Hold on!

12:05.641 --> 12:06.756
Stay in the canoe!

12:06.934 --> 12:09.300
I can-- just--

12:09.478 --> 12:10.729
Oh!

12:10.896 --> 12:12.807
Aaron!

12:12.982 --> 12:14.643
Aaron!

12:14.817 --> 12:17.809
(walkers growling)

12:19.822 --> 12:21.653
(gasping)

12:22.950 --> 12:24.110
Aaron!

12:28.831 --> 12:30.241
(gasps)

12:30.416 --> 12:31.405
I'm okay.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.415
I'm all right.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.880
I'm okay.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.378
I'm okay.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.938
(thumping)

12:56.108 --> 12:57.143
(grunts)

13:09.705 --> 13:12.117
Woman:
Stop hugging the wall.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.033
- Watch it!
- (jar shatters)

13:16.253 --> 13:18.835
Man:
God damn it!

13:19.006 --> 13:21.998
(door creaks)

13:22.176 --> 13:23.712
Go get a mop
and another barrel.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.626
We're keeping this crap?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.012
We don't have to eat it.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.968
Man #2:
Jesus. He hates pickles.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.350
(door creaks)

13:39.318 --> 13:40.558
It's got hooks.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.317
I don't know why
he didn't strap it in.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.025
Told him twice.
His stupid ass didn't listen.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.158
Mm.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.866
(grunts)

13:55.709 --> 13:57.700
(indistinct conversation)

14:07.513 --> 14:09.720
(sighs)

14:09.890 --> 14:11.050
Okay.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.439
Bit of a sore loser.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.770
Huh.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.402
Looks like the only thing
he ran out of was ammo.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.777
We got to
get this back now.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.031
Yeah.

14:31.370 --> 14:35.033
Well, he's got paddles.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.583
And with
the wind picking up,

14:36.750 --> 14:38.490
it shouldn't take long
to drift back to shore.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.753
Man:
Easy.Easy.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.788
Man #2: We got it.
Take this crap back.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.707
Woman: How 'bout, this time,
you watch where you're going?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.844
Oh, come on.
Get off his back.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.255
(grunting)

15:02.526 --> 15:05.768
(walkers growling in distance)

15:05.946 --> 15:08.858
You know, back there,

15:09.033 --> 15:13.242
I didn't mean
that you couldn't do it.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.904
It's just...

15:17.082 --> 15:19.915
going this far,
risking this much

15:20.085 --> 15:21.200
to get things for them--

15:21.378 --> 15:23.209
people don't agree with it.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.839
l was there.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.389
I saw what happened
on the road.

15:37.978 --> 15:41.266
What we're doing is gonna
keep people living.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.647
We get to do that,

15:43.817 --> 15:46.650
it doesn't matter
what happens to us.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.947
Michonne doesn't think
this is living.

15:50.991 --> 15:55.325
Well, committing
to a choice like this,

15:55.496 --> 15:58.954
after living how we did, free,

15:59.124 --> 16:00.375
I get it.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.668
It's hard.

16:04.838 --> 16:05.964
It's giving up everything,

16:06.131 --> 16:07.667
right up
until your own life.

16:11.428 --> 16:15.137
But either your heart's beating,
or it isn't.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.263
Your loved ones' hearts
are beating, or they aren't.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.893
We take what they give us
so that we can live.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.107
(door shuts)

16:37.204 --> 16:38.910
(engine starts)

17:01.145 --> 17:03.682
So, how long you been
with Negan?

17:10.404 --> 17:12.144
Why were you out there
alone?

17:13.991 --> 17:16.073
- (gun cocks)
- Tell me.

17:28.213 --> 17:31.250
You think talking won't change
how this ends for you.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.757
But you don't know me.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.676
Let's see what happens.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.148
(sighs)

17:56.658 --> 18:00.150
I'm not gonna kill him today.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.241
I'm gonna find the way
that we win.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.753
I'm gonna change
how this ends for me.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.879
That's why
I'm out here alone.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.128
(door opens)

18:21.225 --> 18:25.309
(muffled)
Is that an apple pie?

18:25.479 --> 18:26.969
Uh.
How did you do that?

18:27.147 --> 18:28.762
I could smell it
from outside the door.

18:28.941 --> 18:29.976
(sighs)

18:30.150 --> 18:31.526
Uh, you baked it?

18:31.693 --> 18:33.979
Some guy gave it to us
for what we did.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.143
Mm.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.233
His little girl said you should run
for President of Hilltop.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.398
(chuckles)
"Maggie for President."

18:39.576 --> 18:40.827
(chuckles)

18:45.666 --> 18:47.998
Uh, do you want
a plate?

18:48.168 --> 18:50.124
No, I'm good.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.750
Did Jesus
give you those?

18:54.925 --> 18:56.881
Is he still around?

18:57.052 --> 18:58.758
There's some things
I wanna add to his list

18:58.929 --> 19:01.261
before he goes out.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.264
The kids need something
to write with-- pens, pencils.

19:04.434 --> 19:05.640
Are you already
president?

19:05.811 --> 19:06.891
Mm. (chuckles)

19:07.062 --> 19:08.097
I've just been
talking to people.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.638
- (chuckles)
- Jesus left this morning.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.398
He told me to tell you,
but l-l forgot.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.436
Okay. Next time.

19:16.613 --> 19:17.648
I'm gonna get some milk.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.484
- Let me.
- No, I'm good.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.868
(door creaks)

19:28.041 --> 19:29.076
What?

19:29.251 --> 19:32.334
You're lying to Maggie
aboutJesus.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.831
What makes you say that?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.545
A girl who lives
in the house.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.209
She was telling me
about everyone.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.422
She said Jesus is a runner

19:41.597 --> 19:43.588
and that
he left yesterday,

19:43.765 --> 19:45.175
not this morning.

19:46.810 --> 19:49.802
- It's for her own good.
- Why?

19:49.980 --> 19:52.562
Because
I need to do something,

19:52.733 --> 19:54.064
and she'll want to help me.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.225
(scoffs)

19:56.403 --> 19:58.234
You want to kill Negan.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.320
(sighs)

20:03.493 --> 20:05.575
What if you have help?

20:05.746 --> 20:08.533
If we had help--
a lot of people--

20:08.707 --> 20:09.947
then I wouldn't be afraid
to tell her,

20:10.125 --> 20:12.491
because she'd know
it wasn't on her to do it.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.331
- But if it's just me, then--
- It isn't just you.

20:15.505 --> 20:16.790
You and Maggie
aren't the only ones

20:16.965 --> 20:18.000
who want
to take Negan out.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.164
- There's--
- No, Enid.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.423
That's not happening.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.755
And if you care about her,
you don't say anything about this.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.966
(sighs)

20:25.140 --> 20:26.755
We have to keep her safe.

20:26.934 --> 20:30.893
You have to keep her safe.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.643
It isn'tjust you.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.072
It sure looks like it.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.441
Richard: A lot of places came together
after the world fell apart.

20:45.619 --> 20:50.579
Maybe you're both
from one of those places.

20:50.749 --> 20:56.164
Most of those communities
and camps are gone now.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.078
I lost people.

20:58.257 --> 21:03.217
I pretty much lost hope
in people.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.799
But then
I found the Kingdom.

21:05.973 --> 21:09.261
I met Ezekiel.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.765
(sighs)
I saw what he built.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.552
But now I believe
what he built is under threat.

21:13.730 --> 21:14.810
The Saviors.

21:14.982 --> 21:18.816
The Saviors.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.442
A few months back,

21:20.612 --> 21:23.854
Ezekiel and a few guards met
a group of them in the woods.

21:24.032 --> 21:26.444
The Saviors recognized
Ezekiel's capabilities,

21:26.618 --> 21:28.449
and Ezekiel
didn't want to fight,

21:28.620 --> 21:29.735
so they cut a deal.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.869
In exchange
for food and supplies,

21:32.040 --> 21:33.325
no one would get hurt,

21:33.500 --> 21:35.957
and they'd never set foot
inside the Kingdom,

21:36.128 --> 21:38.119
and very few of us
even know.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.333
What does any of this
have to do with me?

21:40.507 --> 21:42.213
I know Ezekiel likes you.

21:42.384 --> 21:45.046
I also know
that Ezekiel trusts you,

21:45.220 --> 21:46.585
and that's why I'm here.

21:46.763 --> 21:49.470
I need you to help me
convince him of something.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.053
Right now,
we have peace with the Saviors,

21:52.227 --> 21:54.559
but sooner or later,
something's gonna go wrong.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.766
Maybe we'll be light
on a drop,

21:56.940 --> 21:59.602
or maybe one of ours will look
at one of theirs the wrong way,

21:59.776 --> 22:04.190
or maybe they'll just decide
to stop honoring the deal.

22:05.532 --> 22:07.898
Things will go bad.

22:08.076 --> 22:09.486
And when they do...

22:12.706 --> 22:15.072
the Kingdom will fall.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.751
I had a family.

22:20.922 --> 22:24.460
I lost it to this world.

22:24.634 --> 22:27.467
I saw them die.

22:27.637 --> 22:31.676
I'm scared that,
if we don't do something now,

22:31.850 --> 22:34.592
that we won't only lose more people,
we'll lose everything.

22:34.770 --> 22:38.012
I know what the Saviors are,
and I know what they do.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.523
And I know
they cannot be trusted.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.322
And I think you know that, too.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.032
What exactly
are you asking?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.949
I'm asking you
to help convince Ezekiel

22:55.123 --> 22:58.832
to attack the Saviors,
to strike first...

22:59.002 --> 23:00.117
and destroy them.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.842
Gabriel:
Is that for you...

23:13.016 --> 23:14.881
or Negan?

23:18.021 --> 23:19.557
It's for him.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.773
How will you do it?

23:23.944 --> 23:27.061
l'll pull the trigger.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.775
They'll kill you.

23:28.949 --> 23:32.362
As long as he goes first.

23:32.536 --> 23:35.198
Why do you have to die?

23:35.372 --> 23:37.533
Because he has to.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.745
I agree.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.254
But...

23:51.638 --> 23:53.219
why do you?

23:57.102 --> 23:58.308
There's, uh...

23:59.896 --> 24:02.148
no need to lie to me if...

24:04.109 --> 24:07.192
this is our last conversation.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.899
If Abraham was alive,
we could fight.

24:17.164 --> 24:20.247
If Glenn was,

24:20.417 --> 24:23.079
Maggie's kid
would have a father.

24:26.047 --> 24:29.710
Michonne and Carl
can fight.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.718
They have Rick.

24:32.888 --> 24:36.631
Aaron has Eric.

24:36.808 --> 24:40.596
Eugene knows things.

24:40.770 --> 24:43.147
Daryl's strong.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.356
What about Sasha?

25:01.416 --> 25:03.077
Look at me, Rosita.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.332
It shouldn't
have been you.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.718
It shouldn't
have been anyone.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.723
We'll win,

25:19.893 --> 25:22.976
but we need to wait
for the right moment

25:23.146 --> 25:26.013
or create it...

25:26.191 --> 25:28.933
together.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.817
And you're a part of that
together.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.111
Don't do this.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.784
We need you.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.622
(sighs)

26:15.740 --> 26:17.401
(door creaks)

26:22.247 --> 26:23.612
("The Program"
plays in background)

26:23.790 --> 26:28.830
J‘ It's the sweetest disease
and on it, you will rely... J‘

26:29.004 --> 26:30.335
(indistinct conversations)

26:30.505 --> 26:35.590
J‘ It's the art of believin'... J‘

26:35.760 --> 26:41.175
(vocalizing)

26:41.349 --> 26:43.510
Richard: Okay.
I know there's a lot of them.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.347
I'm guessing a good deal more
than we have at the Kingdom.

26:46.521 --> 26:48.728
The element of surprise
is our only hope.

26:48.898 --> 26:49.933
We need to attack first,

26:50.108 --> 26:51.223
and we need to do it now

26:51.401 --> 26:53.107
while we still have
the advantage.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.280
Carol, I imagine
that violence and fighting

26:58.450 --> 27:00.315
is something
you haven't been a part of.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.742
You're wrong.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.448
Morgan:
You're very wrong.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.205
She's probably the most capable
fighter in this room.

27:07.375 --> 27:09.457
Then it's time to fight.

27:11.546 --> 27:12.877
No.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.664
This is something
lam not a part of.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.082
Then you don't have to fight.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.636
You just have
to convince Ezekiel

27:18.803 --> 27:19.963
to bring the Kingdom
to fight.

27:20.138 --> 27:22.595
You're not understanding me.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.097
I didn't want you.

27:24.267 --> 27:26.553
I didn't want Ezekiel
or Morgan coming here.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.719
And I don't want anything
to do with your lives

27:28.897 --> 27:30.762
or your deaths.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.352
I just want to be
left alone.

27:38.823 --> 27:42.190
People will die,
a lot of them.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.950
You killed a man.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.826
I took a life
to save a life.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.113
It's the same
goddamn thing.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.202
We'll be taking their lives
to save ours!

27:50.377 --> 27:51.833
Only you don't know
that it will.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.415
You're gonna choose
to kill one day, Morgan,

27:54.589 --> 27:56.580
'cause it will get
that bad!

27:59.135 --> 28:01.091
Why not choose now,

28:01.262 --> 28:03.218
before you lose
someone you care about?

28:03.390 --> 28:04.721
There's a peace now.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.177
I won't be a part
of changing that.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.217
And maybe
we can build on that.

28:09.396 --> 28:10.556
Not with these people!

28:10.730 --> 28:12.641
When they turn on us--
and they will--

28:12.816 --> 28:15.148
that blood is gonna be
on your hands!

28:21.199 --> 28:23.190
But maybe
you're both used to that.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.824
- (door closes)
- You should go, too.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.080
I should.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.294
I don't want anyone else
coming around

28:36.464 --> 28:38.125
or even knowing
where I am.

28:38.299 --> 28:40.335
If you somehow see
anyone we know,

28:40.510 --> 28:42.296
tell them I'm gone.

28:42.470 --> 28:43.926
Do that for me please.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.678
Never meant for you
to see me.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.259
(door creaks)

28:50.061 --> 28:51.437
(door closes)

28:54.816 --> 28:56.147
(door creaks)

29:37.108 --> 29:38.973
(softly)
Hi.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.935
(excitedly)
Hi.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.902
(matter-of-factly)
H i.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.092
ﬂhuds)

30:24.113 --> 30:25.819
(sighs)

30:36.918 --> 30:38.374
(clinking)

30:42.632 --> 30:44.122
(sniffles)

30:47.303 --> 30:48.964
(glass shatters)

30:49.138 --> 30:51.629
(crying)

30:51.808 --> 30:54.800
(music playing)

31:10.493 --> 31:12.154
Rosita:
Hot date?

31:15.582 --> 31:17.197
I'm on a good momentum
with them.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.956
Gonna try to use that.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.708
Yeah? How?

31:23.840 --> 31:27.424
By trying to get closer,
even just to start trying.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.130
lfl can do that,
after a while--

31:29.304 --> 31:30.464
maybe months, maybe years--

31:30.638 --> 31:32.924
maybe then we try something.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.433
I think it's what my mom
would have done,

31:37.604 --> 31:38.935
so it's
what I'm gonna do.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.730
Okay.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.517
(scoffs)

31:46.696 --> 31:49.312
Whatever it was...

31:49.490 --> 31:51.947
I thought
we had something good--

31:52.118 --> 31:54.279
at least, the beginning
of something good.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.740
Why'd you end it?

31:56.915 --> 31:58.030
(chuckles)

31:58.207 --> 31:59.708
Why'd you even start it?

32:02.170 --> 32:03.831
(sighs)

32:04.005 --> 32:05.165
l was trying not
to think about shit.

32:08.384 --> 32:11.751
You're cute, tall.

32:11.930 --> 32:15.468
You're sweet sometimes.

32:15.642 --> 32:16.882
So I used you.

32:25.151 --> 32:26.687
I'm sorry.

32:30.406 --> 32:32.692
Would you
be up for dinner later?

32:34.911 --> 32:36.742
(chucang)
I really mean just dinner.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.244
(chuckles)
No strings.

32:41.084 --> 32:42.369
(chuckles)

32:42.543 --> 32:43.999
All right.

32:44.170 --> 32:46.252
All right.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.257
(scoffs)

32:53.137 --> 32:54.843
(thuds, door creaking)

33:07.527 --> 33:08.812
What the hell?

33:13.324 --> 33:15.610
Whoa. Whoa.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.820
It's cool, I swear.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.660
Buddy, you can walk right out
that back gate there,

33:22.834 --> 33:26.076
and I won't say anything
to anybody.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.744
I'm supposed
to be there now,

33:27.922 --> 33:31.255
but, listen, I'm--
I'm just trying to get by,

33:31.426 --> 33:35.044
just like you.

33:35.221 --> 33:36.677
Please.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.258
(pipe landing)

33:38.433 --> 33:39.422
Daryl.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.558
(grunting)

33:46.149 --> 33:49.516
(breathing heavily)

33:49.694 --> 33:51.650
Daryl.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.571
(pipe clatters)

34:08.046 --> 34:11.334
It ain't just about
gettin' by here.

34:11.507 --> 34:13.372
It's about
gettin' it all.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.965
I got the key.
Let's go.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.681
Arat: No.
| just want to talk to him.

34:21.851 --> 34:22.931
I said "no."

34:23.102 --> 34:25.434
Negan:
Don't be an asshole, Arat.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.687
Let the man pass.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.363
Oh, crap.
Is that for me?

34:37.533 --> 34:40.366
We haven't
officially met.

34:40.536 --> 34:44.154
l'm Spencer Monroe.

34:44.332 --> 34:45.617
(matter-of-factly)
H i.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.127
(brakes squeal)

34:55.301 --> 34:56.882
(gearshift clicks)

34:59.097 --> 35:00.212
That's Negan.

35:04.060 --> 35:07.052
(music playing)

35:13.069 --> 35:15.776
Is he down there?

35:15.947 --> 35:17.062
Yeah.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.822
We're all Negan.

35:22.578 --> 35:25.365
Whatever you're trying to do,
you can't.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.247
But you still have
some choices.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.282
Go home.

35:30.461 --> 35:33.794
Burn this car,
roll it down into a lake,

35:33.965 --> 35:35.876
make it disappear.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.292
There's a silencer
in the glove compartment.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.726
(silenced gunshot)

36:24.056 --> 36:25.887
(gate creaking)

36:42.533 --> 36:43.739
Where is he?

36:43.910 --> 36:45.491
Negan?

36:45.661 --> 36:49.245
He's in your house, asshole,
waiting for you.

36:55.546 --> 36:58.879
(chucang)
VVhoa,hey.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.165
Just like that?

37:00.343 --> 37:02.800
See, we've been
waiting for hours

37:02.970 --> 37:06.554
just to see what
you gonna bring us, huh?

37:06.724 --> 37:09.056
Why don't
we have a look first?

37:12.521 --> 37:16.434
Running water,
air conditioning,

37:16.609 --> 37:18.224
a housewarming gift?

37:18.402 --> 37:19.812
(breathes sharply)
That settles it.

37:19.987 --> 37:23.650
I am getting myself
a vacation home here.

37:23.824 --> 37:25.815
Cheers to that.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.401
Mm.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.200
Mmm.

37:32.375 --> 37:35.458
Oh, that is good.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.335
You know, the only thing missing
is a pool table.

37:38.506 --> 37:43.091
Nothing better
than a good game of 8 ball.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.547
The house across the street
has one in the garage.

37:45.721 --> 37:49.009
Oh, Spencer,

37:49.183 --> 37:51.890
you may just be
my new best friend.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.346
(chuckles)

37:53.521 --> 37:55.637
Such a nice day, though--

37:55.815 --> 37:56.975
too nice to be cooped up

37:57.149 --> 38:00.482
inside some garage,
don't you think?

38:00.653 --> 38:02.109
Yeah.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.566
Oh, I got a better idea.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.372
Gary:
Not bad.

38:15.543 --> 38:19.411
We had to go out
pretty far.

38:19.588 --> 38:22.079
Laura:
What the hell's this?

38:22.258 --> 38:24.965
"Congrats for winning.
But you still lose"?

38:30.683 --> 38:32.719
You leave us
a little love note?

38:32.893 --> 38:35.600
No, ljust--

38:35.771 --> 38:39.559
(chuckling) I mean--
we wouldn't, obviously--

38:39.734 --> 38:40.723
David:
Wait. What?

38:40.901 --> 38:42.437
Did you just say
it's obvious?

38:42.611 --> 38:44.988
Ohh!

38:46.490 --> 38:47.570
We didn't do that.

38:47.742 --> 38:50.028
It's not about the damn note!

38:50.202 --> 38:52.238
Hey. Don't.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.529
Run along to Negan,
Rick.

38:59.587 --> 39:00.702
Ohh!

39:02.131 --> 39:06.545
But your friend here--
he's got no place to be.

39:06.719 --> 39:07.959
- (grunting)
- You--

39:08.137 --> 39:10.344
- Back up!
- (gun cocks)

39:11.640 --> 39:13.767
I could never do this
with Rick.

39:13.934 --> 39:17.097
He would just be standing there,
scowling,

39:17.271 --> 39:21.059
giving me that annoying side-eye
he gives me.

39:21.233 --> 39:25.021
That's actually
what I came to see you about.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.732
I want to talk to you
about Rick.

39:31.285 --> 39:32.946
(breathing sharply)

39:33.120 --> 39:35.987
All right.
Talk to me, Spencer.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.076
Talk to me about Rick.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.746
(grunting)

39:45.966 --> 39:49.458
I get what you're
trying to do here,

39:49.637 --> 39:51.002
what you're
trying to build.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.466
I'm not saying I agree
with your methods,

39:53.641 --> 39:55.097
but I get it.

39:55.267 --> 39:56.302
You're building a network.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.514
You're making people
contribute for the greater good.

39:59.688 --> 40:02.395
It makes sense.

40:02.566 --> 40:05.433
But you should know
that Rick Grimes

40:05.611 --> 40:08.273
has a history of not
working well with others.

40:09.907 --> 40:12.023
- Mm-hmm.
- (balls clacking)

40:12.201 --> 40:13.782
Is that so?

40:17.331 --> 40:19.162
Rick wasn't
the original leader here.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.834
My mom was.

40:21.001 --> 40:24.084
She was doing
a really good job of it.

40:24.255 --> 40:28.339
Then she died,
not long after Rick showed up--

40:28.509 --> 40:30.875
same with my brother,
same with my dad.

40:31.053 --> 40:35.342
So, everything was peachy here
for, what, years?

40:35.516 --> 40:40.306
And then Rick shows up
and suddenly you're an orphan?

40:40.479 --> 40:44.472
That is the saddest story
I've ever heard.

40:44.650 --> 40:47.517
Good thing for you
he's not in charge anymore.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.060
Doesn't matter.

40:49.238 --> 40:50.899
His ego's out of control.

40:51.073 --> 40:53.689
He'll find a way
to screw things up,

40:53.868 --> 40:56.905
to try and do things his way,
to take over.

40:57.079 --> 40:59.365
That's what he did
with my mom.

40:59.540 --> 41:00.825
That's what
he'll do again.

41:09.383 --> 41:12.341
What exactly are you proposing
be done about that?

41:13.429 --> 41:16.171
I am my mother's son.

41:16.348 --> 41:19.840
I can be the leader she was.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.134
That's what
this place needs.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.643
That's what you need.

41:24.857 --> 41:27.439
So I should
put you in charge,

41:27.610 --> 41:28.975
that's what you're saying?

41:30.029 --> 41:32.111
We'd be much better off.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.570
You're all right.
You're all right.

41:37.745 --> 41:39.656
(grunting, groaning)

41:39.830 --> 41:41.445
All right, all right,
all right.

41:41.624 --> 41:42.704
Point made.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.490
(scoffs)

41:48.672 --> 41:50.048
(grunts)

41:52.218 --> 41:55.585
My heart's still beating,
right?

41:55.763 --> 41:57.048
(grunting)

41:57.223 --> 42:00.340
(both panting)

42:00.518 --> 42:03.885
You know,
I'm thinking, Spencer.

42:04.063 --> 42:07.226
I'm thinking
how Rick threatened to kill me,

42:07.399 --> 42:10.607
how he clearly
hates my guts.

42:10.778 --> 42:13.861
But he is out there
right now,

42:14.031 --> 42:16.647
gathering shit for me
to make sure

42:16.825 --> 42:21.535
I don't hurt any of
the fine people that live here.

42:21.705 --> 42:24.663
He is swallowing his hate

42:24.833 --> 42:29.543
and getting shit done.

42:29.713 --> 42:31.453
That takes guts.

42:39.056 --> 42:41.092
And then there's you...

42:43.519 --> 42:45.760
the guy who waited
for Rick to be gone

42:45.938 --> 42:48.020
so he could sneak over
and talk to me

42:48.190 --> 42:49.805
to get me
to do his dirty work,

42:49.984 --> 42:52.566
so he could take
Rick's place.

42:52.736 --> 42:54.476
So I got to ask--

42:54.655 --> 42:57.943
if you wanna take over,

42:58.117 --> 43:00.324
why not
just kill Rick yourself

43:00.494 --> 43:02.985
and just take over?

43:03.163 --> 43:05.028
What? No, no.
I didn't-- I don't--

43:05.207 --> 43:06.788
You know what I'm thinking?

43:06.959 --> 43:11.953
'Cause I have a guess.

43:12.131 --> 43:15.874
(whispering)
It's because you got no guts.

43:16.051 --> 43:17.257
(knife unsheathes)

43:17.428 --> 43:20.261
- (grunting)
- (gaspS)

43:23.100 --> 43:24.965
- Ohh!
- (gasps)

43:26.729 --> 43:29.562
(groaning)

43:38.073 --> 43:41.736
Ohh.
How embarrassing.

43:42.745 --> 43:43.905
There they are.

43:44.079 --> 43:45.819
They were inside you
the whole time.

43:45.998 --> 43:47.113
You did have guts.

43:47.291 --> 43:51.204
I've never been so wrong
in my whole life!

44:10.898 --> 44:13.310
Now, someone

44:13.484 --> 44:17.022
oughta get up here
and clean this mess up.

44:22.117 --> 44:23.823
Oh.

44:27.164 --> 44:30.156
Anyone want to finish
the game?

44:30.334 --> 44:31.665
C'mon.

44:33.337 --> 44:35.623
Anybody?

44:36.965 --> 44:38.876
Anybody?

44:40.427 --> 44:42.884
C'mon.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.511
lwas winning!

44:47.726 --> 44:50.593
(gunshot, shell casing clinking)

44:50.771 --> 44:53.558
(grunting)

44:53.732 --> 44:55.563
(gunshot in distance)

44:58.362 --> 44:59.568
Shit!

44:59.738 --> 45:01.945
What the shit?!

45:02.116 --> 45:05.529
Shit! You just--
you tried to kill me?!

45:05.703 --> 45:07.113
You shot Lucille!

45:07.287 --> 45:08.868
She got in the way.

45:20.926 --> 45:23.463
What is this?

45:26.724 --> 45:28.214
What is this?

45:28.392 --> 45:31.259
This little bad boy
made from scratch?

45:31.437 --> 45:34.099
Look at those crimps.

45:34.273 --> 45:36.730
This was homemade.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.982
You may be stupid, darlin',

45:39.153 --> 45:43.988
but you showed
some real ingenuity here.

45:44.158 --> 45:47.070
Arat, move that knife

45:47.244 --> 45:51.032
up out on that girl's face.

45:52.541 --> 45:55.954
Lucille's beautiful,
smooth surface

45:56.128 --> 45:57.743
is never gonna look the same,

45:57.921 --> 45:59.377
so why should yours?!

46:01.925 --> 46:05.258
Unless...

46:05.429 --> 46:10.139
Unless you tell me
who made this.

46:10.309 --> 46:12.641
It was me.

46:12.811 --> 46:14.426
I made it.

46:14.605 --> 46:18.939
You see, now I just think
you're lying.

46:19.109 --> 46:21.942
And you lying to me now?!

46:24.364 --> 46:26.696
Such a shame.

46:26.867 --> 46:29.529
Arat's gonna have to cut up
that pretty face.

46:29.703 --> 46:30.909
(breathing quickly)

46:31.079 --> 46:32.615
One more try.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.405
It was me.

46:34.583 --> 46:36.323
(chuckles)

46:36.502 --> 46:37.491
Oh!

46:37.669 --> 46:40.627
You are such a badass!

46:43.300 --> 46:44.710
Fine.

46:46.428 --> 46:48.384
Have it your way.

46:48.555 --> 46:49.670
Arat...

46:50.974 --> 46:52.430
Kill somebody.

46:54.061 --> 46:56.017
No. It was me!

46:56.188 --> 46:57.268
No!

46:57.439 --> 46:58.554
Carl: Ohh!

47:17.084 --> 47:19.040
We had an agreement.

47:19.211 --> 47:20.200
(hoarsely)
Rick!

47:20.379 --> 47:23.291
Look, everybody, it's Rick.

47:23.465 --> 47:26.047
Ah, your people are making me
lose my voice

47:26.218 --> 47:27.458
doin' all this yelling.

47:28.595 --> 47:32.008
Rick,
how about a "thank you"?

47:34.726 --> 47:38.514
I mean, look, I know
we started this relationship

47:38.689 --> 47:42.022
with me beating the holy shit
out of your friends,

47:42.192 --> 47:44.274
and because of that,
we're never gonna sit around

47:44.444 --> 47:45.650
and braid each other's hair

47:45.821 --> 47:47.357
or share our deepest,
darkest secrets,

47:47.531 --> 47:49.863
but how about a little credit?

47:50.033 --> 47:52.115
I just bent over backwards

47:52.286 --> 47:55.995
to show you
how reasonable I am.

47:56.164 --> 47:57.904
Your kid--

47:58.083 --> 48:00.039
he hid in one of my trucks

48:00.210 --> 48:03.327
and machine-gunned
a bunch of my men down,

48:03.505 --> 48:07.214
and I brought him home,
safe and sound,

48:07.384 --> 48:10.000
and I fed him spaghetti.

48:15.601 --> 48:17.887
Another one of your people--

48:18.061 --> 48:22.395
well, he wanted me to kill you
and put him in charge.

48:22.566 --> 48:26.184
I took him out for you.

48:26.361 --> 48:29.945
And another one, here--

48:30.115 --> 48:34.404
she shot Lucille,
trying to kill me just now,

48:34.578 --> 48:36.409
so I gave you
one less mouth to feed.

48:36.580 --> 48:38.992
And by looking at her,

48:39.166 --> 48:41.782
that mouth
did some major damage.

48:41.960 --> 48:43.416
Now, personally,

48:43.587 --> 48:45.293
I wouldn't have picked her
to be the one to go,

48:45.464 --> 48:46.920
but Arat...
(sighs)

48:47.090 --> 48:48.830
...I don't know,
didn't trust her.

48:57.976 --> 48:59.887
Your shit's waiting for you
at the gate.

49:00.062 --> 49:01.393
Just go.

49:03.023 --> 49:05.309
Sure thing, Rick...

49:05.484 --> 49:08.772
right after
I find the guy or gal

49:08.946 --> 49:12.814
that made this bullet.

49:12.991 --> 49:14.322
Arat?

49:17.663 --> 49:19.324
It was me!

49:19.498 --> 49:21.910
(Eugene crying)
No, it wasn't.

49:26.171 --> 49:30.210
(sniffling)

49:30.384 --> 49:31.874
It was me.

49:32.052 --> 49:33.883
(sniffles)

49:34.054 --> 49:35.510
It was only me.

49:35.681 --> 49:37.546
You?

49:37.724 --> 49:40.181
(Eugene breathing quickly)

49:40.352 --> 49:43.765
It required one spent casing,
one four-holed turret reloader,

49:43.939 --> 49:46.021
powder,
one funnel for the powder--

49:46.191 --> 49:47.522
Shut up.

49:49.152 --> 49:51.609
I believe you.

50:00.080 --> 50:04.494
(breathes deeply)

50:04.668 --> 50:09.162
Lucille, give me strength.

50:10.465 --> 50:13.457
(sighs)

50:13.635 --> 50:19.346
I'm gonna be relieving you
of your bullet maker, Rick,

50:23.979 --> 50:26.561
And however much you scavenged,

50:26.732 --> 50:28.723
it's not good enough,

50:28.900 --> 50:33.564
because you're still
in a serious, serious hole

50:33.739 --> 50:35.229
after today.

50:39.536 --> 50:40.776
Let's move out!

50:43.331 --> 50:45.583
Rosita:
No! No, no!

50:45.751 --> 50:47.161
Please, just take me!

50:47.335 --> 50:48.950
(ROSit
a Cl' III
! y' g)

50:49.129 --> 50:51.916
Negan:
Rick, I ain't gonna lie--

50:52.090 --> 50:55.674
your kitchen
is a goddamn mess.

50:55.844 --> 50:57.254
(chuckles)

50:57.429 --> 50:59.294
I'll see you next time.

51:19.826 --> 51:24.411
(growling)

51:33.840 --> 51:34.920
-_(grunts)
- (knlfe plunges)

51:44.893 --> 51:47.475
(door opens)

51:51.108 --> 51:52.564
(door closes)

52:00.283 --> 52:01.944
Carl told me
you were in here.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.302
(sighs)

52:29.396 --> 52:31.728
I found
what I was looking for.

52:37.362 --> 52:41.480
I wanted to go
with you and Aaron,

52:41.658 --> 52:43.649
but I couldn't.

52:44.786 --> 52:47.949
I had to go my way.

52:48.123 --> 52:49.954
But when I found it...

52:50.125 --> 52:55.711
(chuckles)
...I realized that...

52:55.881 --> 52:57.963
I didn't want it
to be my way.

53:00.093 --> 53:04.587
I wanted it to be ours,
me and you.

53:11.646 --> 53:14.683
There are more of them,
even more than we thought.

53:14.858 --> 53:17.440
We are outnumbered.
It's not even close.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.607
But that doesn't change
the way that I feel,

53:21.781 --> 53:25.148
because it doesn't change
the way that things are.

53:25.327 --> 53:27.989
We're still alive,
Rick.

53:28.163 --> 53:30.199
So much has happened,

53:30.373 --> 53:32.580
so much that we shouldn't
have lived through.

53:32.751 --> 53:34.036
And...

53:34.211 --> 53:36.998
and in spite of it
or maybe because of it,

53:37.172 --> 53:39.083
we did.

53:40.592 --> 53:45.382
We're still here,
the two of us.

53:45.555 --> 53:49.298
We're still standing,
and we're gonna keep standing.

53:49.476 --> 53:53.094
So, what do we do
with that?

53:53.271 --> 53:57.981
How do we make that
mean something?

53:58.151 --> 54:01.109
We're the ones
who get things done.

54:01.279 --> 54:04.737
You said that.

54:04.908 --> 54:06.944
We're the ones
who live.

54:11.998 --> 54:15.206
That's why
we have to fight--

54:15.377 --> 54:21.213
not for us,
but for Judith, for Carl...

54:22.717 --> 54:25.208
for Alexandria,
for the Hilltop,

54:25.387 --> 54:27.844
for all of us.

54:30.558 --> 54:32.344
We can fight them, Rick.

54:32.519 --> 54:36.432
We can find a way
to beat them.

54:36.606 --> 54:40.098
We can do this.

54:40.277 --> 54:41.938
But...

54:44.906 --> 54:47.568
But...

54:47.742 --> 54:50.905
Only if...

54:51.079 --> 54:54.947
we do this.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.956
Yeah, I know that now.

55:12.058 --> 55:13.844
I know that now.

55:14.019 --> 55:16.931
(breathes sharply)

55:17.105 --> 55:18.970
(crying)

55:43.423 --> 55:46.836
(creaking)

56:10.575 --> 56:13.567
(gasping)

56:22.212 --> 56:25.921
Sasha! Enid!

56:26.091 --> 56:31.677
(gate creaks)

56:40.063 --> 56:41.974
- You're okay?
- I'm okay.

56:43.441 --> 56:45.056
The baby's okay--

56:45.235 --> 56:46.896
all of us.

56:48.530 --> 56:50.145
You were right...

56:50.323 --> 56:54.236
right from the start.

56:54.411 --> 56:58.654
You told us
to get ready to fight.

56:58.832 --> 57:01.118
I didn't listen,
and I couldn't.

57:04.045 --> 57:06.457
I can now.

57:10.510 --> 57:16.221
(music playing)

59:21.099 --> 59:24.967
