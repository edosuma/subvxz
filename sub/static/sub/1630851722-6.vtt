-JEROME: Let's go!
-MIKE: Jack the car up.

00:06.620 --> 00:07.136
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew raced

00:08.137 --> 00:09.137
-to an early lead...
-MIKE: Whoo, baby!

00:10.413 --> 00:12.343
...but took their foot
off the gas too soon...

00:12.448 --> 00:14.413
Dirty Hands,
you're the winners today.

00:14.516 --> 00:16.172
...allowing Dirty Hands to speed

00:16.274 --> 00:19.172
to their first lead
in the team competition.

00:19.274 --> 00:21.309
We got cocky and I kept telling
y'all, "Let's stay focused,

00:21.413 --> 00:24.585
-Let's stay calm."
-KEOGHAN: In the individual
competition,

00:24.689 --> 00:26.655
nine contenders
hustled for a win.

-JEROME: Pop, pop.
-Jerome, hanging loose.

00:29.724 --> 00:32.412
KEOGHAN:
The pressure was too much
for Christine and Kelsy,

00:32.517 --> 00:34.067
who ended up in overtime.

00:34.171 --> 00:36.103
LIA:
She's going out and up.

00:36.206 --> 00:38.171
KEOGHAN:
Christine rose to the top,

00:38.274 --> 00:40.310
and it was lights out
for Kelsy's chances

00:40.412 --> 00:43.448
at theTough as Nails title.

...Savage Crew is down three-two
in the team competition...

00:51.274 --> 00:52.103
...and determined
not to sink any lower.

00:52.689 --> 00:53.758
I mean, really sucks.

00:53.862 --> 00:55.481
-JEROME: Hurry up!
-KEOGHAN: While Dirty Hands

Dirty Hands up.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.275
-TAK: Yeah.
-So we've got to stay up,

02:05.379 --> 02:07.034
you know what I mean?

02:07.137 --> 02:08.137
Yeah, stay hungry.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.413
Let's go.

02:10.550 --> 02:11.068
We're excited

-JEROME: So they're gonna be
pressing...
-Keep it that way.

02:20.378 --> 02:22.103
So they're gonna be
pressing more hard.

02:22.205 --> 02:24.586
-Oh, yeah.
-We gonna go harder.

02:26.481 --> 02:28.550
MIKE: So we're, like,
halfway through,

02:28.655 --> 02:31.240
and it's hard for me,
because three of the people

02:31.343 --> 02:33.275
that I picked to be
on Savage Crew

02:33.378 --> 02:35.137
are out of the individual now.

02:36.620 --> 02:39.137
Because I know
all three of you guys

02:39.240 --> 02:43.343
are really tough and deserve
to be in the running still.

02:43.448 --> 02:45.033
Going into this challenge today,

02:45.137 --> 02:46.550
I got a lot of weight
on my shoulders.

02:46.655 --> 02:48.275
I want to put more
money in their pockets

02:48.378 --> 02:51.688
and it's definitely
driving me even harder

02:51.793 --> 02:53.240
to make that happen.

02:53.343 --> 02:55.275
-Stay hungry, stay humble.
-Yeah.

02:55.378 --> 02:57.655
Because, like, I know
that now we're finally there

02:57.758 --> 03:00.655
to a point
that I've always wanted.

03:00.758 --> 03:02.171
We have to go out and get it.

03:02.275 --> 03:03.241
Like, it's not gonna
be given to us.

03:03.343 --> 03:04.620
We know that, so...

03:04.723 --> 03:07.103
Yeah, nothing bad,
but I want some blood.

03:07.205 --> 03:09.275
I-I want that win.

KEOGHAN:
Welcome to Cinagro Farms.

03:25.620 --> 03:27.448
Oh, my God, Lia,
tell me that's not a seagull.

03:28.550 --> 03:30.620
-It's not a seagull, Phil.
-What is it?

03:30.723 --> 03:32.067

That looks like
a turkey vulture to me.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.206
[laughter]

03:34.310 --> 03:37.550
All right, there's two million
farmers in the United States.

03:37.655 --> 03:38.655
Each farmer can feed about

03:38.758 --> 03:42.310
165 people every year,

03:42.413 --> 03:44.550
which is pretty incredible.

03:44.655 --> 03:45.723
Today's job.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.103
You see that irrigation

03:47.206 --> 03:49.067
sprinkling off
in the field down there?

03:49.171 --> 03:51.481
Well, the farmers here
have to keep moving it

03:51.586 --> 03:53.448
so all their crops
can get water.

03:53.550 --> 03:56.343
When the work whistle blows,
both teams have to run

03:56.448 --> 04:00.033
to the center of the field
and turn off the water supply

04:00.137 --> 04:02.068
for two lines of irrigation.

04:02.171 --> 04:04.103
You will need to move
that irrigation

04:04.205 --> 04:06.103
from the far end of the field

04:06.205 --> 04:09.688
to this area of the field
right here behind my truck.

04:09.793 --> 04:13.758
In all, each team has to move
32 sections of pipe

04:13.861 --> 04:17.620
across an area the size
of three football fields.

04:17.723 --> 04:19.379
Be careful, because if you
damage any of the pipes

04:19.481 --> 04:21.654
when you're moving them,
you're gonna have to grab

04:21.757 --> 04:23.586
new ones from the stockpile.

04:23.689 --> 04:25.689
The first of you to get
all the irrigation

04:25.793 --> 04:28.481
moved into the field,
turn on the water supply,

04:28.586 --> 04:31.033
get those sprinklers up
and running again

04:31.137 --> 04:33.413
will win today's Badge of Honor

04:33.516 --> 04:35.067
and $12,000.

04:36.654 --> 04:38.586
Take a moment to strategize,

04:38.689 --> 04:40.447
-and I'll see you at the start.
-All right.

04:42.137 --> 04:42.723
-All right.
-KELSY: Now that I'm out
of the individual competition,

04:43.793 --> 04:45.550
I know that the only way
that I can make the money

04:45.654 --> 04:46.793
is in these team challenges.

04:46.896 --> 04:49.137
So Savage Crew
has to buckle down

04:49.240 --> 04:50.206
and make it happen.

04:50.310 --> 04:51.689
I want to take the lead on this.

04:51.793 --> 04:53.343
I feel like I've been around
agriculture my whole life.

04:53.447 --> 04:54.413
I am agriculture.

04:54.516 --> 04:55.723
-SARAH: Take it.
-We got your back.

04:55.826 --> 04:57.172
-I'm with that, yeah.
-Got your back, girl.

04:58.379 --> 05:00.172
Christine, you've been so calm
and cool under pressure

05:00.274 --> 05:02.654
on our previous team challenges,

05:02.757 --> 05:05.033
and I think you'd be
a great team lead again.

05:05.137 --> 05:07.137
Yeah, whatever you guys need,
I'm here for you.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.447
Christine has been crew boss
three times for Dirty Hands.

05:09.550 --> 05:11.172
You know,
this-this being her third,

05:12.550 --> 05:13.654
because she's real crisp
in how she present her ideas

05:14.620 --> 05:16.206
on how we can get
the job done efficiently.

05:17.516 --> 05:19.172
I want to make less trips so we
don't fatigue ourselves as much,

05:19.274 --> 05:20.723
'cause we got some
big guys over there, so...

05:22.172 --> 05:24.172
-That don't mean nothing.
-That means they sink deeper
in the mud.

05:24.274 --> 05:26.413
-[laughter]
-Yeah, yeah.

05:26.516 --> 05:28.413
-I've done irrigation like this
for eight years.
-Okay.

05:28.516 --> 05:30.447
So I know that one person

05:30.550 --> 05:32.310
can carry one section
by themselves.

05:32.413 --> 05:35.413
You need to lift it completely
straight-armed over your head.

05:35.516 --> 05:38.000
KELSY:
I think we need
to have two on one pole.

05:38.103 --> 05:39.310
-We need to partner up in pairs.
-ELIZABETH: These pipes
are light.

05:40.481 --> 05:41.103
They're made for one person
to carry them at a time.

05:41.206 --> 05:44.137
I've done irrigation,

05:44.240 --> 05:47.343
so I kind of voice my experience
on what works best, uh,

05:47.447 --> 05:49.516
but Kelsy has some other ideas.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.172
Communication is key.

05:51.274 --> 05:52.689
If something's not working
of what we just planned,

05:52.793 --> 05:54.103
then we're gonna
change it on the fly

05:54.206 --> 05:55.137
-and we're very good at it.
-MIKE: Yes.

05:56.137 --> 05:57.137
ELIZABETH:
Kelsy's the crew boss.

05:58.274 --> 05:58.723
We're gonna start out
with her strategy,

05:59.689 --> 06:00.240
if it's not working,
we'll switch it up.

06:01.274 --> 06:03.343
-All right. One, two, three.
-ALL: Savage Crew!

06:03.447 --> 06:06.172

And look at this.

06:26.413 --> 06:28.172
Alfie, our oldest competitor,

06:28.274 --> 06:31.689
he's left everyone
stuck in the mud.

06:31.793 --> 06:33.379
QUINCEY:
This is gonna be tough.

06:33.481 --> 06:36.067
KEOGHAN:
Tak, finally catching up
to Alfie,

06:36.172 --> 06:38.137
and the first to reach
the main water supply.

MIKE:
Good work. Sarah, come on.

06:41.137 --> 06:42.137
SARAH:
At the start
of this irrigation challenge,

06:43.516 --> 06:45.067
I realize it's gonna be
a lot harder than I thought.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.516
The field sucks.

06:46.620 --> 06:49.000
I mean, really sucks.

06:50.172 --> 06:52.689
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew, the last to get
to the main water supply...

06:54.379 --> 06:57.137
...but the first to turn off
a line of irrigation.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.723

shut down for Dirty Hands.

07:04.379 --> 07:06.274
Tak still struggling.

07:06.379 --> 07:09.481
Savage Crew the first to get
both lines of irrigation

07:09.586 --> 07:11.447
-shut off.
-TAK: I got there first

07:11.550 --> 07:13.447
and I can't figure out
how to turn it off.

07:13.550 --> 07:15.343
As soon as we turn off
the water, then we can start

07:15.447 --> 07:18.516
moving the irrigation,
so I got to hurry up.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.206
LIA:
There you go. You got it.

07:20.310 --> 07:22.103
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew have the lead.

07:27.862 --> 07:30.240
The first team to move
all the irrigation

07:30.343 --> 07:32.516
to the other field and get
the sprinklers going again,

07:32.620 --> 07:34.310
gonna win
today's Badge of Honor.

right here.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.723
the latch hook
to disconnect each section

-of irrigation pipe.
-Pull, Mike! Pull!

Mike and Hanger,
the first to get their section

Oh, my gosh.

07:55.103 --> 07:56.206
Do you guys feel like you
can pick up another one?

07:57.067 --> 07:57.447
-HANGER: Nope, I like this.
-Okay.

07:58.447 --> 07:59.103
KELSY:
Today's plan for me was

08:00.550 --> 08:03.033
we were gonna partner it up
and carry two pipes at once,

08:03.137 --> 08:05.172
but our team thought
that was not a good idea.

08:05.274 --> 08:07.274
So we switched.

08:07.379 --> 08:10.447
Our team was only gonna grab
one person per pipe.

08:10.550 --> 08:13.137
-HANGER: I keep on sinking.
-KELSY: It's okay.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.206
KELSY:
Push, dig deep.

08:18.481 --> 08:19.620
Can you get it by yourself?

08:19.723 --> 08:21.033
CHRISTINE:
No, take two at a time!

08:21.137 --> 08:23.689
-Okay.
-CHRISTINE: My plan today

08:23.793 --> 08:27.033
is to go into groups of two
according to height

08:27.137 --> 08:29.516
and I would like everybody
to carry two pieces of pipe

08:29.620 --> 08:31.067
on their shoulders

08:31.172 --> 08:32.793
so that they're not really
using their arms too much

08:32.895 --> 08:34.724
and better for balance.

08:34.826 --> 08:37.309
This is not a sprint.
Stay a slow and steady pace.

08:37.413 --> 08:39.136
KEOGHAN:
Quincey probably got
ten pounds of mud

08:39.240 --> 08:40.551
on his feet.

08:42.033 --> 08:44.517
QUINCEY:
So much mud;
I-I played football before,

08:44.620 --> 08:46.620
and I played on rainy nights
and muddy fields,

08:46.724 --> 08:48.447
but it wasn't anything
up to this caliber.

08:48.551 --> 08:52.136
I've never gotten out
on an offense or defensive line

08:52.240 --> 08:55.033
and my legs
disappear in the mud.

08:56.551 --> 08:59.136
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew almost
at the main water supply.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.793
They still have the lead.

09:00.895 --> 09:03.206
Having each team member
carry one section

09:03.309 --> 09:06.724
of irrigation pipe at a time
is working for them so far.

09:06.826 --> 09:08.344
-ELIZABETH: Push.
-MIKE: Push. pick it up.

09:08.447 --> 09:09.688
-KELSY: Alfie...
-Ooh.

09:09.793 --> 09:11.274
Savage Crew already
lining out their pipes

09:11.379 --> 09:12.517
ALFIE:
One.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.309
KELSY:
Okay, we're going
to the next one.

09:14.413 --> 09:17.000
Once we got to the other side
of the field

09:17.102 --> 09:19.000
and laying those pipes,
it was easy.

09:19.102 --> 09:20.758
-It was quick connect.
-There.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.033
The problem was walking
and getting through the mud.

09:23.136 --> 09:25.344
Holy cow.

09:28.206 --> 09:29.136
No.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.586
Sarah. Sarah, I'm stuck.

09:31.688 --> 09:33.379
[panting]

09:34.931 --> 09:35.481
ALFIE:
It's so wet that once you bury
your feet in it...

09:35.965 --> 09:36.481
[sucking sound]

09:37.172 --> 09:38.136
...it sucks right into you.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.033
Now you want your foot out,
but you're not going nowhere.

09:41.136 --> 09:43.033
You're pulling like this.

09:43.136 --> 09:45.033
So as you start falling,
it's a slow-motion thing.

09:45.136 --> 09:46.240
'cause the mud don't let you go.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.206
KEOGHAN:
Elizabeth using
a very interesting technique.

09:53.309 --> 09:56.379
I'm not sure what you call it,
but I think I saw

09:56.481 --> 09:59.033
David Attenborough introducing
an animal that does this.

09:59.136 --> 10:01.172
[chuckles]

10:01.274 --> 10:04.067
-MIKE: She's a beast.
-KEOGHAN Yeah, she's strong.

10:04.172 --> 10:05.517
[grunts]

10:05.620 --> 10:07.240
I'm stuck now.

10:07.344 --> 10:09.654
JEROME:
Okay. Hey, good.

10:09.758 --> 10:11.481
KEOGHAN:
Two different techniques.

10:11.586 --> 10:15.136
Dirty Hands moving two lines
of irrigation at one time.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.136
Savage Crew with a more
linear approach,

10:18.240 --> 10:20.481
moving one line
of irrigation at a time.

10:20.586 --> 10:23.654
Savage Crew's first
to take a second load

10:23.758 --> 10:25.447
of irrigation pipe.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.033
-I need help!
-I got you, Sarah.

10:29.136 --> 10:30.793
[panting]

10:30.895 --> 10:32.102
SARAH:
I was dying.

10:32.206 --> 10:33.551
I just felt like, you know,

10:33.654 --> 10:35.379
I needed to have
a partner with me

10:35.481 --> 10:36.724
because it's-it's killing me.

10:36.826 --> 10:40.551
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew still ahead,
but Elizabeth and Sarah

10:40.654 --> 10:42.102
switching strategies.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.102
They're doing exactly
what Kelsy said

10:44.206 --> 10:46.447
they should do
in the first place: pairing up.

10:46.551 --> 10:48.344
-You got that one?
-Go ahead. Go.

10:48.447 --> 10:50.379
-Single?
-Huh? Up to you.

10:50.481 --> 10:51.758
-Yeah, let's do it.
-Okay.

10:51.861 --> 10:53.551
KEOGHAN:
And Dirty Hands
are switching it up.

10:53.654 --> 10:57.206
Tak and Lia working on their
own. Is this going to pay off?

10:57.309 --> 10:59.724
TAK:
Feel like I can go a little
faster working by myself.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.447
I've been carrying two-by-fours,
you know, my whole career.

11:02.551 --> 11:03.758
Hundreds of yards.

11:03.861 --> 11:05.206
Sometimes the forklift is down,

11:05.309 --> 11:06.758
so carrying that pipe was like

11:06.861 --> 11:08.724
carrying two-by-fours
across the jobsite.

11:08.826 --> 11:11.172
-Are you guys splitting up?
-Here you go.

11:11.274 --> 11:14.240
-TAK: Yeah.
-CHRISTINE: I would like
two pieces at a time.

11:14.344 --> 11:16.447
-LIA: I think you go faster.
-CHRISTINE: All right.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.102
LIA:
Christine is the youngest
of our-our Dirty Hands crew,

11:19.206 --> 11:20.586
but she takes our suggestions,

11:20.688 --> 11:22.309
which is a great
leadership trait,

11:22.413 --> 11:23.481
to work with your team.

11:23.586 --> 11:25.240
-It's cool.
-CHRISTINE: Keep it up.

11:25.344 --> 11:27.067
Coming at you. Finish it up.

11:27.172 --> 11:30.240
KEOGHAN: Sarah, putting
the end cap on the first line

11:30.344 --> 11:32.274
of irrigation pipe
for Savage Crew.

11:32.379 --> 11:36.033
They've completed their
first line. One more to go.

11:36.136 --> 11:37.654
Kelsy and Hanger
coming back to get

11:37.758 --> 11:39.654
the second line of irrigation.

11:39.758 --> 11:42.758
But it's a long way back
to the far end of the field.

11:42.861 --> 11:44.551
CHRISTINE:
Savage Crew, they've been
kind of leading us

11:44.654 --> 11:46.447
and we've been trailing behind,
but I noticed

11:46.551 --> 11:48.793
that Savage Crew worked
on one line at a time

11:48.895 --> 11:51.102
instead of both
at the same time,

11:51.206 --> 11:53.172
so they have to go
all the way back again.

11:53.274 --> 11:55.309
It's just double the running.
I think we still have a chance.

11:55.413 --> 11:57.102
-JEROME: Good job, Kalimba!
-KEOGHAN: Dirty Hands

11:57.206 --> 11:59.586
yet to complete moving
one line of irrigation,

11:59.688 --> 12:01.620
but they are moving two lines
at one time,

12:01.724 --> 12:03.517
so they don't have
as far to travel.

12:03.620 --> 12:05.724
Savage Crew's lead is closing.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.758
KELSY:
Alfie, give me that.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.136
We're gonna do an assembly line.

12:09.240 --> 12:12.067
We were working on one line

12:12.172 --> 12:14.102
instead of getting both
irrigation lines at once,

12:14.206 --> 12:16.724
and you just couldn't
move through this mud.

12:16.826 --> 12:20.102
-SARAH: Rotate.
-KEOGHAN: Savage Crew adapting
their technique again.

12:20.206 --> 12:21.067
But is it too late?

12:22.033 --> 12:23.102
Dirty Hands have made up
a ton of ground.

12:23.206 --> 12:26.758
Lia coming back for
the last pipe for Dirty Hands

12:26.861 --> 12:29.517
-on this side of the field.
-JEROME: Let's go, Lia!

12:29.620 --> 12:32.274
-Get that pipe!
-KEOGHAN: Dirty Hands now have

12:32.379 --> 12:35.172
all their irrigation pipes
to complete the job.

12:35.274 --> 12:36.724
Tak attaching the end cap.

12:36.826 --> 12:39.586
Dirty Hands has a line
of irrigation complete,

12:39.688 --> 12:42.172
but will it work
when they turn the water on?

12:42.274 --> 12:43.688
Hey, t-turn this one on!

12:43.793 --> 12:46.136
Christine the crew boss today
turning on

12:46.240 --> 12:48.551
the first line of irrigation
for Dirty Hands.

12:48.654 --> 12:50.758
-QUINCEY: Whoa, that went off!
-JEROME: Hey, come help me!

12:50.861 --> 12:53.654
-But they have a burst pipe!
-[Jerome shouts]

12:53.758 --> 12:55.517
-CHRISTINE: Shut it off?
-JEROME: Go! Go! Turn it off!

12:55.620 --> 12:57.102
LIA:
Turn it off!

12:57.206 --> 12:58.517
-Water off!
-Turn it-- Hurry up!

12:58.620 --> 13:00.240
KEOGHAN
Can Savage Crew catch up?

13:01.447 --> 13:02.620
JEROME:
Hurry up!

13:09.274 --> 13:11.309
Turn it off! Hurry up!

13:11.413 --> 13:13.620
This first line of irrigation
for Dirty Hands,

13:13.724 --> 13:16.274
-it's got a burst pipe.
-CHRISTINE: There's a pipe
that's broken?

13:16.379 --> 13:17.447
Looks like you broke
the connection on your pipe

13:17.551 --> 13:20.067
after some rough handling.

13:20.172 --> 13:22.102
Savage Crew have a chance
to catch up.

13:22.206 --> 13:24.033
The win goes
to the first team to complete

13:24.136 --> 13:27.136
two lines of irrigation
and get those sprinklers going

13:27.240 --> 13:28.586
-JEROME: Turn it off!
-LIA: There's a leak

13:28.688 --> 13:30.447
spraying all over the place,

13:30.551 --> 13:32.000
the pipe comes off.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.000
I'm right there
at the sprinkler.

13:34.102 --> 13:35.172
[imitates spitting sprinkler]

13:35.274 --> 13:36.033
JEROME:
Got to turn them off!

13:36.136 --> 13:37.274
KEOGHAN:
Christine is struggling

13:37.379 --> 13:39.172
to turn this irrigation
back off.

13:39.274 --> 13:42.067
Quincey, opening up the second
line of irrigation

13:42.172 --> 13:44.309
to test that one.

13:44.413 --> 13:45.688
The line is good.

13:45.793 --> 13:48.551
Dirty Hands have one
complete line of irrigation,

13:48.654 --> 13:51.067
but their second line
is out of control.

13:51.172 --> 13:53.379
-TAK: We got to take this off.
-You damaged your latch hook.

13:53.481 --> 13:56.309
Dirty Hands,
your pipe is broken.

13:56.413 --> 13:57.344
You need to pick up
a replacement

13:57.447 --> 13:58.586
from the other end of the field.

14:00.861 --> 14:02.102
Oh, we done broke a pipe.

14:03.102 --> 14:04.379
[laughs] Suddenly--
And we're all looking.

14:05.586 --> 14:07.136
KEOGHAN:
Quincey's going back
to get a backup pipe.

14:08.344 --> 14:10.102
It's a 300-yard journey to
the other end of the field.

14:10.206 --> 14:12.206
Oh, bro, looking to do one
more run in that mud,

14:12.309 --> 14:14.724
gonna be, gonna be hard.

14:14.826 --> 14:17.136
TAK:
Let's go!

14:17.240 --> 14:18.309
Come on, Quincey!

14:18.413 --> 14:20.344
[panting]

14:21.344 --> 14:23.206
Hurry up!

14:25.586 --> 14:27.067
KELSY:
Should I turn this on?

14:27.172 --> 14:28.586
KEOGHAN:
Kelsy turning on the first line

14:28.688 --> 14:31.240
of irrigation for Savage Crew.
Both teams

14:31.344 --> 14:34.102
with one line
of irrigation working.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.688
Quincey at the far end
of the field

14:35.793 --> 14:37.413
-picking up a replacement pipe.
-LIA: Hurry up! Come on!

14:37.517 --> 14:39.793
KEOGHAN:
Oh, Quincey, don't break it
again. Watch that.

14:39.895 --> 14:41.688
You guys, relay it up!

14:41.793 --> 14:43.586
Just get it here,
and then we'll take it.

14:43.688 --> 14:45.793
Go, go, go. Go.

14:45.895 --> 14:47.517
It gets super draining
and taxing

14:47.620 --> 14:49.793
on your body
to run all the way down.

14:49.895 --> 14:51.067
You got it? Yeah?

14:52.206 --> 14:52.586
KALIMBA:
So I just come up with an idea

14:53.206 --> 14:53.688
to relay it back.

14:54.240 --> 14:54.724
I'm a firm believer

14:55.481 --> 14:56.000
of working smarter, not harder.

14:56.654 --> 14:57.067
Grab one by yourself, Tak.

14:57.758 --> 14:58.102
JEROME:
Good job, Kalimba.

14:58.688 --> 15:00.240
Savage Crew, one section

15:00.344 --> 15:02.102
of irrigation pipe to complete

15:02.206 --> 15:05.067
-their second line.
-SARAH: Go! Go! Go! Go!
-Go, Mike! Go!

15:05.172 --> 15:07.033
We were working
on that last irrigation,

15:07.136 --> 15:09.136
and I knew that it came down

15:09.240 --> 15:11.758
to how fast we could get
that last pole down there.

15:11.861 --> 15:13.724
I knew that Savage Crew
wasn't gonna give up.

15:13.826 --> 15:16.102
Elizabeth, I need help.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.102
-Okay. Plug it.
-In.

15:18.206 --> 15:20.033
-Cap. On!
-Turn 'em on! Turn 'em on!

15:20.136 --> 15:21.240
KEOGHAN:
Dirty Hands have replaced

15:21.344 --> 15:22.413
their pipe with a new one.

15:22.517 --> 15:24.724
Quincey turning
the water back on.

15:24.826 --> 15:26.102
But no!

15:26.206 --> 15:27.793
Connection's still leaking.

15:27.895 --> 15:30.172
Hey. Hey, twist this tube.

15:30.274 --> 15:32.136
Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.000
TAK:
We put the last pipe on.

15:34.102 --> 15:37.033
We turn on the water,
and boom, it bursts.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.379
If one thing doesn't work,
we have to try another way,

15:39.481 --> 15:42.136
so we have to take that line
and flip it

15:42.240 --> 15:43.758
and then reconnect it.

15:43.861 --> 15:46.274
-Push. Okay. Hey, Tak!
-KEOGHAN: Dirty Hands have

15:46.379 --> 15:48.344
their new piece of pipe
in place.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.551
But it's impossible to get

15:50.654 --> 15:52.413
the end plug attached
with all that water pressure.

15:54.413 --> 15:56.206
-JEROME: Turn 'em off!
-KEOGHAN: Savage Crew

15:56.309 --> 15:58.551
still with a shot.
Kelsy opening up

15:58.654 --> 16:00.240
the second line of irrigation,

16:00.344 --> 16:02.067
but it doesn't look like
it's connected at the other end.

16:02.172 --> 16:03.724
Shut it off!

16:03.826 --> 16:05.586
KEOGHAN:
Elizabeth signaling to Kelsy

16:05.688 --> 16:08.136
to turn off the sprinklers
so she can connect

16:08.240 --> 16:11.067
-the last pipe.
-What's happening?

16:11.172 --> 16:13.033
KEOGHAN:
Dirty Hands still struggling.
The water is flying

16:13.136 --> 16:15.413
everywhere at the other end,
but Dirty Hands

16:15.517 --> 16:16.758
-can't shut the pipe off.
-TAK: No!

16:16.861 --> 16:19.136
-Turn 'em off!
-It's off!

16:19.240 --> 16:21.481
TAK:
Okay! Okay!

16:21.586 --> 16:22.793
-Come on!
-QUINCEY: Turn it on!

16:22.895 --> 16:24.413
CHRISTINE:
Turn it on!

16:24.517 --> 16:26.274
KELSY:
What's happening?

16:26.379 --> 16:29.309
You guys got to shut it off!

16:29.413 --> 16:30.586
Turn it off!

16:30.688 --> 16:32.102
Okay, here we go!

16:32.206 --> 16:34.033
We just couldn't get
that last one on.

16:34.136 --> 16:36.136
It was such a long stretch,

16:36.240 --> 16:38.102
and we just couldn't hear
and communicate.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.793
-Turn it on!
-I'm trying!

16:40.895 --> 16:43.136
KEOGHAN:
Both teams turning on
their second line of sprinklers.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.551
Hang on, we got 'em!

16:48.136 --> 16:49.620
-Dirty Hands with the win!
-JEROME: Yeah!

16:49.724 --> 16:51.724
[Christine whoops]

16:51.826 --> 16:54.758
-[laughs]
-Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

16:54.861 --> 16:56.620
We're winning this thing, baby.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.758
The score is 4-2.
I couldn't be happier.

16:58.861 --> 17:02.240
We have one more challenge
to get that $60,000,

17:02.344 --> 17:04.067
and I think we're gonna do it.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.689
SARAH:
We lost. Turn it off.

17:09.792 --> 17:11.136
It's over.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.240
The score is 4-2. Apparently,

17:13.344 --> 17:15.103
the motivational speeches
and things like that

17:15.205 --> 17:18.103
still haven't actually
taken effect yet.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.723
-That was a hard one. Yeah.
-We hit it differently.
That's all.

17:20.826 --> 17:23.000
It was a hard loss,
but I'm also thinking

17:23.103 --> 17:25.654
I hate to see
some of Savage Crew down.

17:25.758 --> 17:27.172
Let's-let's have a good time.

17:27.275 --> 17:29.136
LIA:
Do it!

17:29.240 --> 17:31.067
-MIKE: Yeah!
-[laughter]

17:31.172 --> 17:32.619
HANGER:
Check him out.

17:32.723 --> 17:35.448
[whoops]
Yeah!

17:35.550 --> 17:37.448
[whoops]

17:37.550 --> 17:39.723
It was an amazing feeling
to have the team

17:39.826 --> 17:41.205
come over a-and join me.

17:41.309 --> 17:42.034
Yeah!

17:42.826 --> 17:43.654
Just to keep the spirits up

17:43.758 --> 17:45.689
and not our heads down.

17:45.792 --> 17:47.275
-Hey!
-Yes!

17:47.378 --> 17:52.103
SARAH:
I don't know why we're
celebrating a loss. I really...

17:52.205 --> 17:54.103
You know,
I'm-I'm speechless on that.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.586
[Sarah sniffles]

17:56.689 --> 17:58.103
Like, for real, I got you.

17:58.205 --> 18:00.205
KEOGHAN:
Okay, guys. Bring it in.

18:00.309 --> 18:02.792
SARAH:
We lost our focus yet again.

18:02.895 --> 18:04.240
We're back to square one.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.172
Great work today, everyone.

18:06.275 --> 18:08.034
Savage Crew,
I know it's a tough loss,

18:08.136 --> 18:10.413
but, Dirty Hands, I am pleased
to tell you that you have won

18:10.517 --> 18:12.067
today's team competition.

18:12.172 --> 18:14.205
Team score
stands at four to two.

18:14.309 --> 18:16.240
Christine, as the leader
of Dirty Hands...

18:16.344 --> 18:19.034
-Literally dirty hands, Phil.
-KEOGHAN: Literally dirty hands.

18:19.136 --> 18:21.378
I want to present you
with today's Badge of Honor.

18:21.481 --> 18:24.136
-Thank you. [chuckles]
-KEOGHAN: Congratulations.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.586
And also $12,000.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.758
-Wipe your hand off somewhere.
There you go.
-[laughs]

18:29.862 --> 18:31.792
-[cheering]
-Obviously,

18:31.895 --> 18:33.205
you got some laundry to do.

18:33.309 --> 18:34.275
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

18:34.378 --> 18:35.309
KEOGHAN:
Get scrubbed up,

18:35.413 --> 18:37.378
exfoliate, and maybe put on

18:37.481 --> 18:39.792
some fresh clothes
before you get in the vans.

18:39.895 --> 18:41.517
-Thank you, Phil.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

18:48.067 --> 18:49.758
SARAH:
In this challenge, we just,

18:49.862 --> 18:52.067
you know, we got outworked.
It is what it is.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.723
But this is our third in a row.

18:53.826 --> 18:55.689
I respect everybody giving it

18:55.792 --> 18:58.000
their all.
Everybody dug deep, no doubt.

18:58.103 --> 19:01.517
But we were celebrating
at the end in-in the mudslide,

19:01.619 --> 19:02.723
and I couldn't get down
with that

19:02.826 --> 19:04.586
because for me, i-it's a loss.

19:04.689 --> 19:06.136
MIKE:
Yeah,

19:06.240 --> 19:08.136
it sucks that
we're not winning this money

19:08.240 --> 19:10.103
and we're not winning
these challenges,

19:10.205 --> 19:12.034
but I'm blessed
and so happy to be here

19:12.136 --> 19:14.000
with the five of you guys.

19:14.103 --> 19:17.067
And the plus side of things
is the money.

19:17.172 --> 19:19.723
And that's, I think, the biggest
challenge as a group,

19:19.826 --> 19:22.103
because we find
the silver lining in it,

19:22.205 --> 19:24.136
but the silver lining
is not paying the bills.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.067
My gramps left land

19:26.172 --> 19:28.067
for the family
when he passed away,

19:28.172 --> 19:31.654
so, for me, that motivation
and that money is going to be

19:31.758 --> 19:33.654
building on it so that

19:33.758 --> 19:35.619
my nephews have a leg up.
You know what I'm saying?

19:37.862 --> 19:39.481
MIKE:
Glad you brought this up,

19:39.586 --> 19:41.205
because the picture
in my head of, like,

19:41.309 --> 19:43.619
why I'm here,
what I've struggled through,

19:43.723 --> 19:45.309
that's a motivating factor
for me.

19:45.413 --> 19:48.067
The whole mud sliding thing
is just a...

19:48.172 --> 19:49.758
a thing of, like, camaraderie.

19:49.862 --> 19:51.586
Sarah telling her story

19:51.689 --> 19:53.619
is very empowering to me

19:53.723 --> 19:56.205
'cause we're all here to help
out our families, as well.

19:56.309 --> 20:00.000
It's like, "Okay, Mike, you got
to step it up even harder now

20:00.103 --> 20:01.136
and win that $60,000."

20:01.240 --> 20:03.205
I want to beat 'em really bad.

20:03.309 --> 20:05.309
I got three boys in my house

20:05.413 --> 20:07.275
that I have to set
an example for.

20:07.378 --> 20:10.000
A-And I got to provide
for my family,

20:10.103 --> 20:12.067
so I don't got a choice
but to succeed.

20:12.172 --> 20:14.172
-I'm with you.
I'm not here to lose.
-SARAH: Right.

20:14.275 --> 20:15.378
KELSY:
Savage Crew has to have

20:15.481 --> 20:18.448
three wins to get that $60,000,

20:18.550 --> 20:21.172
and we have to do
three more nonstop.

20:21.275 --> 20:22.758
It's now or never.

20:22.862 --> 20:23.964
ALFIE:
That money's on the table, man.

20:24.067 --> 20:25.792
-HANGER: Let's get it, guys.
-ALFIE: Let's go get it.

Good morning, you guys.

-How are you guys?
-Good morning, Savage Crew.

20:39.275 --> 20:41.654
-Hey, there's Phil in a field.
-Good morning, everybody.

20:41.758 --> 20:43.481
TAK:
Today's individual challenge.

20:43.586 --> 20:45.586
No one to count on
to catch your back,

20:45.689 --> 20:47.689
so everything
depends on yourself.

20:47.792 --> 20:49.517
I think I'm physically fit.

20:49.619 --> 20:51.309
For me, I struggle mentally.

20:51.413 --> 20:53.205
I just got to stay focused.

20:53.309 --> 20:55.689
Good morning, everybody.
Can you smell that?

20:55.792 --> 20:57.067
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-LIA: It smells good.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.517
That's the smell of mint,
isn't it?

20:59.619 --> 21:00.758
-No.
-KEOGHAN: No.

21:00.862 --> 21:02.448
That's cilantro.
It's growing here

21:02.550 --> 21:03.792
in California all year long.

21:03.895 --> 21:06.000
It's been an ingredient

21:06.103 --> 21:08.067
that we've used in food
for over 5,000 years.

21:08.172 --> 21:11.172
And the way that it's picked
is backbreaking work.

21:11.275 --> 21:13.034
You look over in the fields,
and you see

21:13.136 --> 21:14.550
how hard
everybody is working here.

21:14.654 --> 21:17.067
That's your job today.
Each of you

21:17.172 --> 21:19.413
have to harvest
two 60-foot rows of cilantro.

21:19.517 --> 21:22.240
When the work whistle blows,
you're gonna use

21:22.344 --> 21:24.586
this special knife
called a hand sickle. You see,

21:24.689 --> 21:26.205
it's got a sharp blade
on that side there.

21:26.309 --> 21:28.792
You need to use this tool
to cut and trim

21:28.895 --> 21:30.309
bundles of cilantro,

21:30.413 --> 21:32.448
then wrap them in wire.
Just like that.

21:33.275 --> 21:35.240
Doesn't matter
how many bundles you cut.

21:35.344 --> 21:38.448
Doesn't matter how many boxes
you fill up. The goal is

21:38.550 --> 21:40.000
to clear all the cilantro,

21:40.103 --> 21:42.413
filling up one box at a time,

21:42.517 --> 21:44.517
and then load them up
onto those trailers.

21:44.619 --> 21:47.654
The last two of you
to finish the job

21:47.758 --> 21:50.103
will go into overtime,
and by the end of the day,

21:50.205 --> 21:52.172
one more of you
will be punching out,

21:52.275 --> 21:54.205
leaving seven of you
still in contention

21:54.309 --> 21:57.172
for the overall
Tough As Nailstitle.

21:57.275 --> 22:00.344
The good news is
if you win today's job,

22:00.448 --> 22:01.413
you will be getting

22:01.517 --> 22:03.205
an entire year's supply

22:03.309 --> 22:04.517
of fresh produce

22:05.654 --> 22:05.689
-for you and your family.
-Wow.
-LIA: All right.

22:06.172 --> 22:07.205
Is that for real?

22:08.000 --> 22:08.550
You're gonna send that
to Hawaii?

22:09.862 --> 22:11.136
KEOGHAN:
If you win, Tak,
you'll be getting fresh produce

22:12.240 --> 22:12.619
-from a local Hawaiian vendor.
-Wow. Wow.
-Wow.

22:13.654 --> 22:14.309

A year of produce?
[exhales]

22:21.654 --> 22:23.034
I'm dropping 400 bucks a week

22:23.136 --> 22:24.758

22:24.862 --> 22:26.103
I got to win this thing.

When I compete,
nothing holds me back,

22:32.862 --> 22:34.619
and nothing moves me
from my path

22:34.723 --> 22:37.517
and my focus.
I know that if I go to overtime,

22:37.619 --> 22:40.344
I will survive, but the goal

22:40.448 --> 22:41.550
is to not go.

22:41.654 --> 22:43.205
KEOGHAN:
Here we go.

QUINCEY:
When I was a teenager,

23:16.895 --> 23:17.758
I was working with a farmer

23:18.448 --> 23:19.550
that had a bean field.

23:20.619 --> 23:21.205
When the bean harvest
came back into the barn,

23:21.826 --> 23:22.586
you know, it was my job

23:23.619 --> 23:24.654
to pick out sticks
or dirt, rocks.

23:24.758 --> 23:26.000
We had to get it right.

23:26.103 --> 23:28.034
You know,
we-we had to deliver quality.

23:29.309 --> 23:32.275
KEOGHAN:
Tak, our foreman,
is moving very, very well.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.723
-Be careful
with that knife, Tak.
-TAK: Yes, sir.

23:34.826 --> 23:38.136
I worked in some lo'i patches
before where they grow taro.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.448
You got to be low to the ground,

23:39.550 --> 23:42.103
and I'm already
low to the ground. [laughs]

23:42.205 --> 23:44.067
SARAH:
Hustle!

23:45.103 --> 23:46.689
KEOGHAN:
Alfie looking like a pro.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.034
Great technique.

23:49.275 --> 23:49.723
ALFIE: The first couple
of cuts, the sickle

23:50.723 --> 23:52.136
was slowing me down
from grabbing the tie,

23:53.448 --> 23:55.000
so soon as I made the cut,
I would grab the bundle,

23:55.103 --> 23:58.067
leave the sickle exactly
where I'm gonna cut next,

23:58.172 --> 24:00.689
take the tie, wrap it.
Boom, boom, two twists.

24:00.792 --> 24:03.448
Throw it in the box.
Grab the next bundle,

24:03.550 --> 24:05.378
and the sickle's there to cut,
so I'm like...

24:05.481 --> 24:07.034
[exhaling]
In the box.

24:07.136 --> 24:08.792
[exhaling] In the box.

24:08.895 --> 24:11.586
-Good job, Alfie!
-HANGER: Keep up the pace,
brother.

24:11.689 --> 24:14.034
-Not bad for a Miami boy, huh?
-[Hanger laughs]

24:14.136 --> 24:16.172
Lia nice and steady.
Got all her ties

24:16.275 --> 24:18.517
on her leg. She's going
in a standing position.

24:18.619 --> 24:21.275
Jerome
using the standing position.

24:21.378 --> 24:23.103
The advantage I had on my side,

24:23.205 --> 24:25.619
I was the second one in.
I saw all my competitors.

24:25.723 --> 24:27.550
Only had Mike behind me.

24:27.654 --> 24:29.034
I knew he was gonna be fast.

24:30.172 --> 24:30.758
But as long as I was
in front of everybody this side,

24:30.862 --> 24:31.792
I was all right.

24:31.895 --> 24:33.205
Let's go, team!

24:33.309 --> 24:34.550
It's hard to tell
where everybody is at

24:34.654 --> 24:36.654
'cause there's
two different approaches.

24:36.758 --> 24:39.103
Lia moving down one row.

24:39.205 --> 24:41.240
Alfie was doing the same,
but looks like he's doing

24:41.344 --> 24:42.758
what everybody else is doing:

24:42.862 --> 24:45.136
harvesting two rows at a time.

24:45.240 --> 24:48.205
Lia taking a risk,
but maybe it'll pay off.

24:48.309 --> 24:50.619
LIA:
If I remain
on one row at a time,

24:50.723 --> 24:54.275
I don't have to keep readjusting
to reach over to another row,

24:54.378 --> 24:58.000
so I can maintain
the same rhythm going down.

24:58.103 --> 24:59.792
It's gonna shave off
a couple seconds for me

24:59.895 --> 25:02.067
and keep me ahead
of what my competitors

25:02.172 --> 25:04.205
-are doing.
-KEOGHAN: Look at that.

25:04.309 --> 25:05.723
KELSY:
Lia has her first box,

25:05.826 --> 25:07.275
KEOGHAN:
Lia's got her first box.

25:07.378 --> 25:09.309
She's coming back
to the trailer.

25:09.413 --> 25:11.136
Dropping off her ties
on the way, but...

25:11.240 --> 25:12.619
I'll get 'em when I get back.

25:12.723 --> 25:13.689
Long time ago,

25:13.792 --> 25:15.103
I helped harvest tobacco.

25:15.205 --> 25:17.448
The process, it's very similar,

25:17.550 --> 25:20.034
so I'm trying to mimic that
as best I can.

25:20.136 --> 25:23.309
Alfie, our superintendent,
doing a great job.

25:23.413 --> 25:25.448
-HANGER: There you go.
-KEOGHAN: Here comes Elizabeth.

25:25.550 --> 25:27.205
Good job, Eliza-beast.
Let's go, Mark!

25:27.309 --> 25:29.654
-Yeah!
-SARAH: Hustle, people, hustle!

25:29.758 --> 25:32.136
-Quincey and Jerome
at the same time.
-You got it, Quince.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.067
KEOGHAN:
Tak is looking at his first box.

25:34.172 --> 25:36.000
Everybody's delivered a box

25:36.103 --> 25:37.481
except for ironworker Christine,

25:37.586 --> 25:40.517
-struggling to get back
with her first box.
-Crap.

25:40.619 --> 25:42.309
Harvesting cilantro,

25:42.413 --> 25:43.758
it's a lot more intense
than you'd think.

25:43.862 --> 25:45.723
-KALIMBA: Let's go, Christine.
-CHRISTINE: Everybody was ahead

25:45.826 --> 25:48.413
of me, and normally,
I'd get really frustrated

25:48.517 --> 25:52.205
and beat myself up,
but today, no negative energy.

25:52.309 --> 25:55.654
Wow, Lia is flying
down that single row.

25:55.758 --> 25:58.067
Making great progress,
but it's hard to tell

25:58.172 --> 26:00.205
where Lia's at
compared to everybody else.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.619
-KELSY: Come on!
-SARAH: Let's go, Christine!

26:02.723 --> 26:05.034
-Tak has slowed down
a little bit.
-KELSY: Yeah.

26:05.136 --> 26:07.240
Every individual challenge,
I'm always in my head.

26:07.344 --> 26:08.723
I'm always pressuring myself.

26:08.826 --> 26:10.413
And this competition right now,

26:10.517 --> 26:12.205
it's getting harder
and harder and harder.

26:12.309 --> 26:15.000
I just know I have to stay calm
and dig down deep.

26:15.103 --> 26:17.034
Tak, you got to speed it up.
You got to speed it up.

26:17.136 --> 26:18.448
Tak is just like
a little brother.

26:19.723 --> 26:19.758
It's like he just doesn't know
how great he is.

26:20.481 --> 26:21.172
Tak is just one of those guys

26:22.136 --> 26:22.586
that just needs somebody
to believe in him,

26:23.413 --> 26:24.275
and he's gonna be unstoppable.

26:25.205 --> 26:25.654
You got to pick it up.
Got to pick it up.

26:26.448 --> 26:27.067
KELSY:
Good job, Mike! Good job!

26:27.895 --> 26:28.550
HANGER:
Good job! That's right!

26:29.172 --> 26:30.378
Way to hustle, Shaffer.

26:31.723 --> 26:32.619
-That's called
the Shaffer shuffle right there.
-That's right.

26:33.689 --> 26:34.723
-The Shaffer shuffle.
-MIKE: I love you guys.

26:35.826 --> 26:37.103
-I know.
Back at you, my brother.
-Yeah, bro!

26:38.586 --> 26:40.205
MIKE:
I figured out
while cutting that cilantro

26:40.309 --> 26:42.240
that I got lineman skills
that I'm using here.

26:42.344 --> 26:44.103
We use tie ware at work, too,

26:44.205 --> 26:45.586
so I've done this before.

26:45.689 --> 26:47.103
Muscle memory, it felt like.

26:47.205 --> 26:50.034
-KEOGHAN: Alfie back. [whoops]
-Go, Alfie!

26:50.136 --> 26:52.103
KEOGHAN:
Quincey drops down

26:52.205 --> 26:53.517
to his knees,
working on another box.

26:53.619 --> 26:55.103
He's gonna have
to pick up the pace

26:55.205 --> 26:57.240
if he wants to win
this competition.

26:57.344 --> 26:59.034
Everybody, give it your all!

26:59.136 --> 27:02.067
KEOGHAN:
Elizabeth sliding
into the row every time.

27:02.172 --> 27:04.172
ELIZABETH:
I'm sliding out with one leg.

27:04.275 --> 27:05.240
It's the easiest way
to slow down

27:06.309 --> 27:07.586
because I have
an old back injury.

27:07.689 --> 27:08.689
I herniated three of my disks.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.275
I recovered fully,

27:10.378 --> 27:12.103
but by sliding in
with that energy,

27:12.205 --> 27:13.103
I'm shaving seconds.

27:13.205 --> 27:14.240
Christine, the last

27:15.205 --> 27:16.619
to finish packing
her first box of cilantro.

27:17.964 --> 27:18.792
-Good job.
You're staying smooth.
-Stay focused. Stay focused.

27:19.758 --> 27:20.172
KEOGHAN:
Already survived two overtimes.

27:21.034 --> 27:21.448
You don't want
to go into a third.

27:22.619 --> 27:23.136
-KELSY: Keep the hustle.
-CHRISTINE: I know at this point

27:23.862 --> 27:26.034
that I'm behind, but I came into

27:26.136 --> 27:27.586
this individual challenge day
with a better mindset,

27:27.689 --> 27:30.344
and I'm not gonna give up
until I get it done.

27:30.448 --> 27:31.723
-SARAH: Yeah, Mike! Yeah!
-KEOGHAN: Lia gets

27:31.826 --> 27:33.103
-her first row done.
-Yeah!
-Good job!

27:34.136 --> 27:35.517
-She's going back
for her second.
-Awesome!

27:36.689 --> 27:37.586
We're gonna find out whether
Lia made the right choice.

27:38.309 --> 27:40.413
Jerome and Mike have the lead,

27:40.517 --> 27:42.136
closely followed by Quincey.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.481
-Alfie right there.
-HANGER: Good job.

27:44.586 --> 27:46.586
KEOGHAN:
Tak very close.
Picking up the pace.

27:46.689 --> 27:49.723
-Elizabeth very competitive.
-ELIZABETH: I got a good rhythm.

27:49.826 --> 27:52.136
I got a good pace.
And all of a sudden,

27:52.240 --> 27:53.619
I move.

27:53.723 --> 27:56.103
[grunts]
My back.

27:57.103 --> 27:58.172
My back spasms,

27:58.275 --> 28:00.067
and I feel all the muscles

28:00.172 --> 28:02.000
on my right side

28:03.586 --> 28:05.067
-just tighten up.
I know I've pinched a nerve.
-KEOGHAN: Elizabeth's down.

28:06.378 --> 28:07.103
ELIZABETH:
And I know
this is gonna hurt me.

28:08.275 --> 28:08.309
-KELSY: Come on! Come on!
-KEOGHAN: Come on.

28:13.654 --> 28:15.205
-SARAH: Yo.
-HANGER: She's hurtin'.

28:15.309 --> 28:17.413
Elizabeth, you okay?

28:17.517 --> 28:19.654
ELIZABETH:
I know I've pinched a nerve.
The problem is

28:19.758 --> 28:22.378
is that my muscles
get really tight,

28:22.481 --> 28:26.205
and going to my knees
really hurt me in this instance.

28:26.309 --> 28:28.205
And, so, I was in a lot of pain,

28:28.309 --> 28:31.172
but it's just not an option.
I came here

28:31.275 --> 28:33.586
to win, win, win
and take it home

28:33.689 --> 28:36.067
-Come on, Elizabeth.
-ELIZABETH: My back.

28:36.172 --> 28:37.309
-KELSY: Come on.
-HANGER: Come on! Come on!

28:38.517 --> 28:40.240
-SARAH: All right, I see you!
-KELSY: Come on! Come on!

28:40.344 --> 28:41.481
HANGER:
There you go. Good job.

28:41.586 --> 28:42.689
KEOGHAN:
Elizabeth back up,

28:42.792 --> 28:44.550
determined to finish this.

28:44.654 --> 28:45.689
-SARAH: Let's go.
-Don't count her out.

28:45.792 --> 28:48.103
We know she's tough as nails.

28:55.205 --> 28:58.481
Tak has picked up the pace,
as has Christine.

28:58.586 --> 29:01.550
-Pick it up. Pick it up.
-Lia is accelerating
towards the end.

29:01.654 --> 29:03.000
LIA:
Oh, yeah.

29:03.103 --> 29:05.413
KEOGHAN: Lia,
the only one here that went

29:05.517 --> 29:07.103
-with one row at a time.
-HANGER: Good job. Good job.

29:07.205 --> 29:08.550
-That's how you gonna do me?
-That's gonna do you.

29:08.654 --> 29:11.136
-We're in this together.
-Another box

29:11.240 --> 29:12.067
-for Lia.
-JEROME: Wow.

29:12.964 --> 29:14.067
KEOGHAN:
She's a box away from a win.

29:15.550 --> 29:16.172
-KELSY: Push! Push! Push!
-KEOGHAN: Mike sees
how much Lia has left.

29:17.067 --> 29:18.136
He wants this win, too.
But hold on

29:18.240 --> 29:20.103
a second. Look where Tak is.

29:20.205 --> 29:22.448
Where did Tak come from?
Out of nowhere.

29:22.550 --> 29:24.205
-That's it, Tak, let's go, Tak.
-Speed it up. Speed it up,
speed it up.

29:24.309 --> 29:26.309
TAK:
Kalimba is a morale booster.

29:26.413 --> 29:28.723
Double-time, Tak.
Got to stay out of overtime.

29:28.826 --> 29:30.378
TAK:
She's cheering for me
and telling me

29:30.481 --> 29:32.413
to step on it, and I need that.

29:32.517 --> 29:35.517
-KEOGHAN: Lia
on the home stretch.
-KELSY: Step on the gas!

29:35.619 --> 29:38.550
Just a few bundles away.
Mike, the lineman,

29:38.654 --> 29:40.240
and Tak,
our construction foreman,

29:40.344 --> 29:42.654
-are chasing after Lia
for the win.
-KELSY: Hurry!

29:42.758 --> 29:44.136
-SARAH: That's it,
Mike! That's it!
-KELSY: Get it in the box!

29:44.240 --> 29:45.309
-SARAH: Come on!
-KALIMBA: Tak, you got to hurry.

29:45.413 --> 29:46.723
KELSY:
Mike, come on! Hurry!

29:46.826 --> 29:49.172
Guys, this is coming down
to seconds!

29:49.275 --> 29:51.550
-And Lia gets the win!
-Good job, Lia.

29:51.654 --> 29:53.000
-[Kelsy shouts]
-SARAH: Mike!

29:53.103 --> 29:53.862
-[Hanger whoops, shouts]
-KELSY: Let's go!

29:53.964 --> 29:55.481
KEOGHAN:
Mike gets the job done!

29:55.586 --> 29:57.344
-Tak, he finishes third.
-Yeah!

29:57.448 --> 29:59.172
-Beautiful job.
-Come on, Christine!

29:59.275 --> 30:01.448
Five left.
Two of you going into overtime.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.481
-Who's it gonna be?
-LIA: Come on, Christine!

30:04.586 --> 30:06.309
-HANGER: Come on, Elizabeth!
-Keep going!

30:06.413 --> 30:08.723
-Keep going!
-HANGER: Come on, Alfie!
Move it!

30:08.826 --> 30:10.240
-KELSY: Come on!
-HANGER: Go, go, go, go, go, go.

30:10.344 --> 30:11.689
-[exhales]
-KELSY: Push!

30:11.792 --> 30:14.205
-KEOGHAN: Here comes Alfie.
-HANGER: Let's go, Alfie!

30:14.309 --> 30:15.792
KEOGHAN:
Closing up his box.

30:15.895 --> 30:19.034
-Alfie!
-Alfie with the job done!
We're down to four.

30:19.136 --> 30:21.517
-Two you going into overtime.
-KALIMBA: Yep,
that's it, Christine.

30:21.619 --> 30:24.205
-Double, double, double.
-Jerome very close.
-Come on, Elizabeth!

30:24.309 --> 30:26.067
-Go! Go, Elizabeth!
-KELSY: Hurry!

30:26.172 --> 30:27.517
Put it in the box!

30:27.619 --> 30:29.034
KEOGHAN:
Here comes Jerome

30:29.136 --> 30:31.103
-and Elizabeth at the same time.
-HANGER: Yeah!

30:31.205 --> 30:33.103
And Jerome and Elizabeth

30:33.205 --> 30:34.517
-get the job done.
-KELSY: Wow!

30:34.619 --> 30:36.103
KEOGHAN:
Christine and Quincey,

30:36.205 --> 30:38.136
-the last to get our job done.
-Oh, man.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.344
This sucks!
Two of our people in overtime?

30:40.448 --> 30:43.067
-[laughs]
-QUINCEY: How about that?

30:43.172 --> 30:44.067
It's never good
when you're in overtime,

30:45.103 --> 30:45.758
but I'm
still in the competition,

30:46.931 --> 30:48.067
so why not give my best
to try to win it?

30:50.103 --> 30:52.448
-[Elizabeth groans]
-MIKE: You okay?

30:52.550 --> 30:54.136
-You okay?
-MIKE: Your back killing you?

30:54.240 --> 30:55.517
Is it your back?

30:55.619 --> 30:58.448
-MIKE: Is it the hammy?
-No, it's my hip is out.

30:58.550 --> 31:00.275
-Okay.
-ELIZABETH: I'm just happy

31:00.378 --> 31:02.689
that I'm not gonna be going
into overtime,

31:02.792 --> 31:06.103
but it's extremely painful,
so I have

31:06.205 --> 31:08.448
to stretch
and try to correct that.

31:08.550 --> 31:11.067
-[grunts]
-Okay, you can lean
on me anytime.

31:11.172 --> 31:13.172
-Elizabeth, you're in a lot
of pain right now, huh?
-ELIZABETH: Yeah,

31:13.275 --> 31:16.172
my hip went out halfway through.
I couldn't run.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.448
It was excruciating,
but I just kept going.

31:19.550 --> 31:22.205
-I know you did.
-Yeah, I just wanted to finish.

31:22.309 --> 31:24.205
Well, Elizabeth,
you showed a lot of grit and...

31:24.309 --> 31:27.172
and determination, considering
what you were going through.

31:27.275 --> 31:29.034
The good news is you get
to rest up. You do not need

31:29.136 --> 31:30.689
-to go into overtime.
-Yeah. [grunts]

31:30.792 --> 31:33.034
KEOGHAN:
Lia, you showed everybody
from the beginning

31:33.136 --> 31:35.448
what you're made of, and today,
you did it one more time.

31:35.550 --> 31:38.172
Pleased to tell you
that you do have

31:38.275 --> 31:42.378
a year's supply of fresh
produce. Congratulations.

31:42.481 --> 31:45.413
LIA:
Everybody's getting a box
of produce for Christmas.

31:45.517 --> 31:47.067
I'm sharing with everyone, Phil.

31:47.172 --> 31:48.758
-Share it with everybody?
-Yeah.

31:48.862 --> 31:50.654
The way I was raised taught me

31:50.758 --> 31:52.550
to care for others
at an early age.

31:52.654 --> 31:54.481
My mother was sick with MS,

31:54.586 --> 31:57.205
and it taught us that, and it-it
sticks with you a lifetime.

31:57.309 --> 31:59.758
So, if I can,
I'd like to set it up

31:59.862 --> 32:01.586
so every month, the produce goes

32:01.689 --> 32:04.103
to one of my other
Tough As Nails family.

32:04.205 --> 32:06.619
Life is to be shared.

32:06.723 --> 32:10.275
Quincey and Christine,
you will be going into overtime,

32:10.378 --> 32:13.378
and by the end of the day,
one of you will be punching out.

32:18.448 --> 32:20.103
♪

32:22.136 --> 32:25.067
CHRISTINE:
I'm in overtime
for the third time.

32:25.172 --> 32:27.136
I've been here before, so I'm
used to the stress already.

32:27.240 --> 32:30.103
I'm definitely prepared
to take that win.

32:30.205 --> 32:32.034
A lot of people here
have established careers.

32:32.136 --> 32:33.792
I'm still an apprentice

32:33.895 --> 32:35.172
living paycheck to paycheck.

32:35.275 --> 32:36.378
Winning that money

32:36.481 --> 32:38.205
would change my life so much.

32:38.309 --> 32:40.413
-KELSY: Yeah!
-Yeah!

32:40.517 --> 32:42.172
-[whoops]
-Okay.

32:43.619 --> 32:44.448
QUINCEY:
This is the first time
two Dirty Hands

32:45.172 --> 32:46.103
had to go against each other.

32:47.413 --> 32:48.000
It hurts a lot that I'm
going against my teammate,

32:48.689 --> 32:49.205
but I can't punch out.

32:50.240 --> 32:51.275
This is redemption for me,
you know?

32:52.448 --> 32:53.758
-That's the reason why I came.
-KEOGHAN: You will now

32:53.862 --> 32:55.481
face off in overtime.

32:55.586 --> 32:57.723
This is a chance
for you to stay in contention

32:57.826 --> 32:59.136
for the Tough As Nailstitle.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.654
As you can see, there are

33:01.758 --> 33:04.344
two sections of weeds
that need to be harrowed.

33:04.448 --> 33:07.550
They've got some overgrown
cilantro, rhubarb, radishes.

33:07.654 --> 33:09.240
And the reason they leave them
growing like this

33:09.344 --> 33:11.275
is it gives nutrients back
into the soil

33:11.378 --> 33:12.792
so that when they replant again,
the soil

33:12.895 --> 33:14.550
is nice and rich and fertile.

33:14.654 --> 33:16.413
But we have left two sections
for you.

33:16.517 --> 33:18.309
-Thank you.
-Just for you.
-[all laugh]

33:18.413 --> 33:20.413
-"Thank you."
-CHRISTINE: I already know
what we're doing, Phil.

33:20.517 --> 33:22.517
-What are we doing?
Why don't you just tell us?
-We're gonna freaking drive

33:22.619 --> 33:24.689
-some tractors.
-KEOGHAN: Have you ever driven
a tractor?

33:24.792 --> 33:27.136
No. Piece of grass in my hand.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.034
Maybe a beer and just cruise?
That'd be awesome.

33:29.136 --> 33:30.240
-You know?
-[laughter]
-A straw hat.

33:30.344 --> 33:32.517
I would strongly advise
no beer drinking.

33:32.619 --> 33:35.067
And, uh, maybe don't put
any grass in your mouth,

33:35.172 --> 33:36.172
-although it is...
-CHRISTINE: Not that kind
of grass.

33:36.275 --> 33:37.172
It is legal here in California.

33:37.275 --> 33:38.240
[laughter]

33:38.344 --> 33:39.586
When the work whistle blows,

33:39.689 --> 33:41.000
you're gonna be using a tractor

33:41.103 --> 33:42.413
and a disc harrow to turn

33:42.517 --> 33:44.723
all of this biomass
back into the soil.

33:44.826 --> 33:46.619
Turn it over
as fast as you possibly can,

33:46.723 --> 33:49.413
but be precise.
If you leave a spot,

33:49.517 --> 33:51.240
you're gonna have to go back
and fix it.

33:51.344 --> 33:53.654
Dirty Hands, anything you want
to say to your two competitors?

33:53.758 --> 33:55.448
-They gonna bring it.
They gonna bring it home.
-Go get 'em.

33:55.550 --> 33:57.689
-Let's do it. Let's do it.
-Let's have some fun. Cheers.

33:57.792 --> 34:02.034
-To your tractors.
-LIA: This is the first time
we have two members

34:02.136 --> 34:05.654
of Dirty Hands in overtime,
uh, against one another.

34:06.689 --> 34:10.206
They're both
incredibly powerful individuals.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.275
They're smart.
They got great heart.

34:12.378 --> 34:15.103
And I'm gonna be on the edge of
my seat watching this overtime.

34:15.206 --> 34:17.378
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

34:17.481 --> 34:20.103
I learned how to drive a tractor
with one of my best friends

34:20.206 --> 34:22.619
when we was working on a farm
back in South Carolina.

34:22.724 --> 34:24.034
I think
I can handle this right here.

34:25.447 --> 34:27.240
CHRISTINE:
If this was
just a week or two ago,

34:27.344 --> 34:29.172
I'd probably be in tears
right now

34:29.275 --> 34:32.068
because I had the mindset
that I have to be the best

34:32.172 --> 34:34.206
because all these voices
in my head

34:34.309 --> 34:36.206
from my past
have told me that I'm not.

34:36.309 --> 34:38.724
But I'm going to give it
my best. I'm not gonna let up

34:38.827 --> 34:40.309
on Quincey,
and at the end of the day,

34:40.413 --> 34:42.137
we're gonna shake hands
and still love each other.

34:42.240 --> 34:44.000
KEOGHAN:
Start your engines!

34:44.103 --> 34:46.137
[engines start]

34:46.862 --> 34:48.757
Time to get to work.

34:48.862 --> 34:50.550
[work whistle blows]

34:50.655 --> 34:53.206
Quincey off to a fine start,

34:53.309 --> 34:56.413
-but it looks like Christine
can't get her tractor to move.
-Come on.

34:56.516 --> 34:59.034
-JEROME: Christine,
what are you doing?
-It's not in freaking gear.

34:59.137 --> 35:01.034
-KELSY: Oh, my God!
-MIKE: Oh, my God!

35:01.137 --> 35:02.655
Come on, Christine!

35:02.757 --> 35:05.619
-LIA: There goes Quincey.
-KEOGHAN: Quincey plowing ahead.

35:05.724 --> 35:07.309
But Christine
can't even get into first gear.

35:07.413 --> 35:09.103
CHRISTINE:
Oh, my God.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.240
JEROME:
Christine, what are you doing?

35:16.344 --> 35:18.413
It's not in freaking gear!

35:18.516 --> 35:21.137
-KEOGHAN: Quincey plowing ahead.
-JEROME: Oh, there goes Quincey.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.724
KEOGHAN:
But Christine can't even get
into first gear.

35:22.827 --> 35:24.481
-Put the clutch in.
-CHRISTINE: Oh!

35:24.585 --> 35:26.172
[applause]

35:26.275 --> 35:27.516
KEOGHAN:
All right, Christine's off now.

35:27.619 --> 35:29.240
CHRISTINE:
I kind of froze up

35:29.344 --> 35:30.724
'cause I was thinking
it was like a manual car.

35:30.827 --> 35:33.068
You have to put it in gear
and then just let off the clutch

35:33.172 --> 35:35.240
and go,
but I just had it neutral still.

35:35.344 --> 35:38.103
-I was like, "You dummy."
-KEOGHAN: Both tractors go
at the same speed,

35:38.206 --> 35:39.550
so with Quincey
half a row ahead,

35:39.655 --> 35:41.103
Christine's gonna have to rely

35:42.309 --> 35:44.481
on being super precise
with the position of her blade.

35:44.585 --> 35:46.724
-LIA: Go!
-KEOGHAN: Quincey looking
like a relaxed farmer

35:46.827 --> 35:48.206
as he moves up here.

35:48.309 --> 35:51.206
-You done this before, huh?
Yeah!
-Yeah!

35:51.309 --> 35:53.516
QUINCEY:
I was glad that I was able
to get behind the wheel

35:53.619 --> 35:55.619
of something that I,
you know, had done before.

35:55.724 --> 35:57.206
-KALIMBA: Looking good, Quincey!
-KELSY: Good job, Quincey!

35:58.516 --> 35:59.103
-HANGER: He's smooth.
Look at that.
-QUINCEY: So,

35:59.931 --> 36:00.481
for once,
I was in the comfort zone.

36:01.447 --> 36:01.688
-LIA: Yeah!
-SARAH: Yeah, there you go,

36:02.378 --> 36:04.481
-big dog.
-LIA: Go, go, go!

36:04.585 --> 36:07.034
KALIMBA:
Going good, Quincey!

36:07.137 --> 36:10.344
Christine is
at least 100 feet behind.

36:10.447 --> 36:13.413
Looks like Quincey is going
to the far side of the field.

36:13.516 --> 36:15.344
Christine making the turn.

36:15.447 --> 36:18.516
Don't cut any of it up!

36:18.619 --> 36:20.585
-Oh, my God!
-It's the green.
You got to go wide.

36:20.688 --> 36:23.550
-Oh, and she's left
a little patch.
-Oh.

36:23.655 --> 36:25.378
KELSY:
She's treating it
like a lawn mower.

36:25.481 --> 36:27.103
You're gonna miss the corner,
Christine!

36:27.206 --> 36:29.793
Christine misses the other
corner. Got to get all of this.

36:32.827 --> 36:35.240
LIA:
Get the corner!

36:35.344 --> 36:38.172
-Christine has left
these two corners undone.
-KELSY: Wow.

36:38.275 --> 36:39.240
She's gonna have to come back
and do those.

36:39.344 --> 36:42.034
KELSY:
Not good. Ugh.

36:42.137 --> 36:43.688
Christine treated the field
like a lawn mower

36:43.793 --> 36:45.309
and didn't realize that her turn

36:45.413 --> 36:48.000
was gonna cut off
some of the weeds.

36:48.103 --> 36:50.724
I drive a tractor every year.
You go forward

36:50.827 --> 36:52.309
on your pass,
and you turn around,

36:52.413 --> 36:54.655
and you come back
right next to that same pass.

36:54.757 --> 36:56.137
Christine trying to catch up.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.275
LIA:
Go, Christine!

36:58.378 --> 37:00.793
KEOGHAN:
Quincey, don't be so stressed.

37:00.896 --> 37:01.931
He's so chill.

37:02.034 --> 37:04.481
KEOGHAN:
And he makes a nice turn
right here.

37:04.585 --> 37:06.793
JEROME:
Farmer Quincey.

37:06.896 --> 37:09.757
KEOGHAN:
See if Christine
can get this corner.

37:11.206 --> 37:12.413
KALIMBA: She got it now.

37:12.516 --> 37:13.447
-KELSY: Yeah, Christine!
-KEOGHAN: Christine

37:13.550 --> 37:15.000
fixing her mistake,

37:15.103 --> 37:17.688
but she's still got
one corner left to fix.

37:17.793 --> 37:19.481
-KALIMBA: Now she's
overlapping the wheel.
-KEOGHAN: Yeah.

37:19.585 --> 37:22.240
She's driving the wheel over
properly. Nice driving.

37:22.344 --> 37:25.413
SARAH:
When it comes to Christine,
she learns really quick,

37:25.516 --> 37:27.172
even if it's something
she's not familiar with.

37:27.275 --> 37:29.068
And I admire that.

37:29.172 --> 37:30.793
JEROME:
She's better now,
but I don't know how she's gonna

37:30.896 --> 37:33.688
-make up time on this now.
-KALIMBA: Yeah,
she's already behind.

37:34.724 --> 37:37.137
KEOGHAN:
Quincey has extended his lead,

37:37.240 --> 37:39.206
but now that Christine
understands the drill,

37:39.309 --> 37:41.275
she may be able to catch up
with some precise driving.

37:41.378 --> 37:42.655
JEROME:
Good job, Christine!

37:42.757 --> 37:45.481
Quincey playing it super safe.
He's got his wheel

37:45.585 --> 37:48.137
about two feet inside,
overlapping the area

37:48.240 --> 37:50.206
that he's already harrowed
with his blades.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.793
CHRISTINE:
I knew I had to make up time,
so I tried to do

37:52.896 --> 37:54.655
all the harrowing
as precise as possible.

37:54.757 --> 37:56.068
I realized

37:56.172 --> 37:57.516
that driving
over some of the weeds

37:57.619 --> 38:00.137
on my right side, it was still

38:00.240 --> 38:01.688
cutting into and getting it,

38:01.793 --> 38:03.516
so that really made up
some time.

38:03.619 --> 38:05.619
JEROME:
He overlapping them too much.

38:05.724 --> 38:07.516
-Overlapping them too much.
-Yeah.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.688
KEOGHAN:
Quincey playing it safe.

38:08.793 --> 38:10.655
KELSY:
He's wasting too much time.

38:10.757 --> 38:12.585
KEOGHAN:
Christine, though, risking
it all to catch up.

38:12.688 --> 38:14.206
Look at how closely

38:14.309 --> 38:16.034
she's steering her front wheel
to the line of the weeds.

38:16.137 --> 38:19.172
Her blades
are barely catching the edge.

38:19.275 --> 38:21.137
KELSY:
Come on, Christine, you got it!

38:21.240 --> 38:22.481
LIA:
Let's go, girl!

38:22.585 --> 38:24.103
She's not that far behind.

38:24.206 --> 38:26.619
I mean, look at the width
of hers and the width of his.

38:26.724 --> 38:29.413
Christine's making up some time.

38:29.516 --> 38:31.137
This is gonna get pretty close

38:31.240 --> 38:34.137
ALFIE:
Quincey will finish
in two passes.

38:34.240 --> 38:36.619
-One this way and one that way.
-KALIMBA: We'll see.

38:36.724 --> 38:38.103
MIKE:
They both look close.

38:38.206 --> 38:41.034
QUINCEY:
I'm feeling good.
Everything that I disc

38:41.137 --> 38:42.103
is getting turned over
in the field,

38:42.206 --> 38:43.413
and the field is disappearing.

38:43.516 --> 38:45.378
I am this close
to sealing the deal.

38:45.481 --> 38:49.103
-LIA: So, he might have
to do an extra pass.
-SARAH: I think he got it.

38:49.206 --> 38:51.137
-KEOGHAN: He could
get it right here.
-KELSY: Yep.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.137
-ELIZABETH: He's gonna get it.
-KELSY: Yep, right now.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.619
Yeah, Quincey!

38:54.724 --> 38:57.068
-But wait!
-KEOGHAN: No.

38:57.172 --> 38:58.655
He's not getting it all.

38:58.757 --> 39:00.344
-Only one more sliver.
-Yeah, that's what I thought.

39:00.447 --> 39:01.413
-You have one more down there.
-Oh.

39:01.516 --> 39:02.481
JEROME:
Oh. Oh, I see it.

39:02.585 --> 39:03.481
-I see it.
-ALFIE: Yeah, yeah.

39:03.585 --> 39:05.206
Well, what does Christine have?

39:05.309 --> 39:06.793
-ELIZABETH: Wait.
-LIA: She's getting that end.

39:06.896 --> 39:08.275
-HANGER: Yeah, that's right.
-KELSY: Wait a minute.

39:08.378 --> 39:10.034
Wait. Phil, look at Christine.

39:10.137 --> 39:11.447
KEOGHAN:
Hold on a second.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.344
Christine is coming back.

39:13.447 --> 39:15.688
She's managing to pick up
everything in her last row.

39:15.793 --> 39:16.757
ALFIE:
Oh, wow.

39:16.862 --> 39:18.103
This is gonna be close.

39:19.137 --> 39:20.516
CHRISTINE:
I see that I possibly have

39:20.619 --> 39:21.757
a little bit of a lead on him.

39:21.862 --> 39:22.896
I'm finishing my final row,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.137
but I know I have my corner
to finish.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.344
I'm like, "Maybe I got this."

39:27.481 --> 39:28.447
-KALIMBA: Oh, go, Christine!
-KEOGHAN: Here we go.

39:29.481 --> 39:31.206
-KALIMBA: Go! Go!
-KEOGHAN: Go, Christine, go!

39:32.793 --> 39:34.034
-KELSY: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-HANGER: What's she doing?
What's she doing?

39:35.137 --> 39:35.793
KALIMBA:
She's trying
to come this way around.

39:36.724 --> 39:37.447
KEOGHAN:
Quincey starting his last pass

39:38.413 --> 39:39.550
while Christine
tries to grab the patch

39:39.655 --> 39:41.068
she left behind earlier.

39:41.172 --> 39:42.585
-Oh!
-Oh!

39:42.688 --> 39:44.619
-KEOGHAN: Here we go!
-[overlapping shouting]

39:44.724 --> 39:46.275
Go, Christine, go!

39:46.378 --> 39:48.516
Oh, my gosh.

39:48.619 --> 39:51.655
-Christine's got
to cover it all up.
-Go, Christine! Keep going!

39:51.757 --> 39:53.757
-Oh, no!
-Misses a patch.

39:53.862 --> 39:56.068
-Oh!
-She missed the corner.

39:56.172 --> 39:58.275
KEOGHAN:
And...

39:58.378 --> 40:00.344
-ELIZABETH: Yeah!
-KEOGHAN: Quincey with the win!

40:00.447 --> 40:02.103
[cheering]

40:02.206 --> 40:04.550
That was
about as close as it can get.

40:04.655 --> 40:07.000
QUINCEY:
I'm glad I was able to get it.

40:07.103 --> 40:08.550
Christine surprised me,
driving that tractor,

40:08.655 --> 40:10.034
and I'm very proud of her.

40:10.137 --> 40:12.619
But me being overprecise
almost cost me.

40:13.655 --> 40:15.378
Excellent challenge, Quincey.

40:15.481 --> 40:18.034
You look so relaxed.

40:18.137 --> 40:20.206
-We were concerned
you might fall asleep.
-[laughter]

40:20.309 --> 40:22.000
I was in my comfort zone, there.

40:22.103 --> 40:23.172
-Yeah, yeah.
-You were really
in your comfort zone.

40:23.275 --> 40:24.240
It worked out for me.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.068
I mean, I still got
an opportunity to, uh,

40:26.655 --> 40:27.206
reach the ultimate goal.

40:28.172 --> 40:30.137
Quincey, what do you say
to your teammate?

40:30.240 --> 40:32.172
She's lost her shot
at that Tough As Nailstitle,

40:32.275 --> 40:34.000
but she's still part
of Dirty Hands.

40:34.103 --> 40:36.688
As a leader, you have
compassion. You have heart.

40:36.793 --> 40:38.447
You have great work ethic.

40:38.550 --> 40:41.447
And I just see greatness
in her future.

40:41.550 --> 40:42.793
-Yeah.
-Absolutely.

40:42.896 --> 40:44.068
-KEOGHAN: Absolutely.
-It means a lot.

40:44.172 --> 40:46.344
-Thank you.
-[applause]

40:46.447 --> 40:48.137
That right there
just means the world to me

40:48.240 --> 40:50.137
because I've been told
so many times

40:50.240 --> 40:52.103
that I wouldn't amount
to anything

40:52.206 --> 40:54.655
or I'm too stupid
or I'm this and that,

40:54.757 --> 40:57.793
so for people to see that I
have potential to be something,

40:57.896 --> 40:59.068
it's just amazing.

40:59.172 --> 41:01.068
I'm gonna get emotional.
[chuckles]

41:01.172 --> 41:02.655
Just 'cause, like,
I didn't think

41:02.757 --> 41:06.068
I'd get so close to so many
people out here, you know?

41:06.172 --> 41:09.000
-And I'm happy. I won.
-KEOGHAN: Yeah.

41:09.103 --> 41:10.068
[voice breaking]:
I'm happy with myself.

41:10.172 --> 41:12.481
-Yeah!
-You should be super proud

41:12.585 --> 41:14.378
of yourself,
and the great news is

41:14.481 --> 41:16.724
that even though you are out
of the individual competition,

41:16.827 --> 41:19.724
you have a chance
to lead your team to a victory.

41:20.585 --> 41:22.447
[chuckles]:
It's time, Phil.

41:22.550 --> 41:23.516
Yeah.

41:25.724 --> 41:30.068
This whole experience has really
changed Christine, you know?

41:30.172 --> 41:32.688
Like, I feel like a new woman.
I just can't stop smiling

41:32.793 --> 41:35.172
'cause I'm just happy.
What an adventure.

41:35.275 --> 41:38.757
I've kind of molded
this new person inside of me,

41:38.862 --> 41:41.068
and I don't care
what people think anymore.

41:41.172 --> 41:43.172
I'm gonna be me,
and I'm gonna be happy,

41:43.275 --> 41:45.378
and I'm just gonna do
the best I can in this life

41:45.481 --> 41:47.516
and just enjoy
every moment of it.

41:51.862 --> 41:52.309
-Stop doing that.
Don't make me cry, all right?
-[laughs]

41:53.724 --> 41:54.344
There's seven of us left
in the individual competition,

41:55.275 --> 41:57.206
and I'm gonna continue
to go for the win.

41:57.309 --> 41:59.378
KEOGHAN:
Great day, everyone.
Get some rest.

41:59.481 --> 42:01.137

some more money, I promise.

42:02.413 --> 42:04.034
Dry those tears up with a win

42:04.137 --> 42:06.172
-with $6,000, though.
-CHRISTINE: That's right.

42:07.172 --> 42:08.550

I wish this dirt would have been
soft like this yesterday.
