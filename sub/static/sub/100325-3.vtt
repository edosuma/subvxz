00:01.914 --> 00:03.438
MAN: Previously on
Almost Family...

00:03.481 --> 00:05.135
Dr. Bechley, Jane Horner from
The Wall Street Journal.

00:05.179 --> 00:07.442
My source says that
you used your own sperm

00:07.485 --> 00:09.618
to impregnate a patient
at your practice.

00:09.661 --> 00:10.749
Hi, I'm Julia.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.795
Hi.
How do you know each other?

00:12.838 --> 00:14.318
-Oh, um...

00:14.362 --> 00:15.754
Leon Bechley is my dad.

00:15.798 --> 00:18.496
So that means you two might
be brother and sister?

00:18.540 --> 00:20.455
-Julia, we have to let you go.
-This is total crap!

00:20.498 --> 00:21.978
I mean,
how can they do this to you?

00:22.022 --> 00:24.154
I brought my employment
agreement because I was hoping

00:24.198 --> 00:25.764
maybe you guys can look at it.

00:25.808 --> 00:27.592
It's like I finally know
what it feels like

00:27.636 --> 00:29.159
to have an actual dad.

00:29.203 --> 00:30.247
Get out.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.206
Get out!
Get out of our house!

00:32.249 --> 00:34.512
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you need to.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.601
I read your
employment agreement.

00:36.645 --> 00:38.690
-You run the clinic now.
-I'm the boss?

00:38.734 --> 00:41.476
-I'm gonna need your help.
-We'll do it together.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.826
Our office has determined
that Dr. Bechley's misuse

00:43.869 --> 00:48.091
of his genetic material rises
to the level of sexual assault.

00:48.135 --> 00:50.398
Is it me, or is there,
like, a vibe happening

00:50.441 --> 00:53.618
between you
and Amanda Doherty?

00:53.662 --> 00:55.316
Holy...

00:57.144 --> 00:58.884
I'm so glad
to see you all today

00:58.928 --> 01:01.104
at our first NPE group--

01:01.148 --> 01:02.584
"Not Parent Expected."

01:02.627 --> 01:05.195
Whether you're
a Bechley client or not,

01:05.239 --> 01:06.588
all are welcome here.

01:06.631 --> 01:10.200
So thank you for coming
and welcome to the group.

01:10.244 --> 01:11.593
In one way, or another,

01:11.636 --> 01:15.423
all of us have had our lives
disrupted, changed,

01:15.466 --> 01:17.860
by the miracle of DNA testing.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.818
We all have stories.

01:19.862 --> 01:20.906
Who would like to begin?

01:20.950 --> 01:23.561
I have a story to share.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.172
Oh.
Oh, no.

01:25.215 --> 01:29.176
My husband cheated on me with
someone he met on a sex app.

01:29.219 --> 01:30.525
-Oh, my God.
-You, Julia.

01:30.568 --> 01:31.830
You slept with my husband.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.267
-No, I--
-Just admit it.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.616
I--I had no idea.

01:34.659 --> 01:35.834
So you did?

01:35.878 --> 01:37.706
-Well--okay.
-He did?

01:37.749 --> 01:39.577
Didn't you know
he was your brother?

01:39.621 --> 01:40.752
Um--

01:40.796 --> 01:42.667
Yeah, my husband
is her brother!

01:42.711 --> 01:43.755
JULIA: Okay.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.410
She had sex
with her own brother!

01:46.454 --> 01:47.672
And yet here she is,
trying to help all of you.

01:47.716 --> 01:50.414
-Oh, my God.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.547
-Can we talk outsi--
-Pathetic.

01:52.590 --> 01:55.376
I'm so sorry.
I-I didn't know he was married.

01:57.552 --> 01:58.944
Or my brother.

02:02.992 --> 02:06.648
This isn't a friendly visit
for either of us, Roxy.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.346
This is a business meeting.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.782
DIANE: We understand
that you don't want

02:10.826 --> 02:12.567
anything to do with us
right now

02:12.610 --> 02:15.700
in this moment of genetic
exploration of yours.

02:15.744 --> 02:17.572
RON:
But we still work together.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.617
And there are
certain obligations

02:19.661 --> 02:21.663
that we've committed to
that you need to honor.

02:21.706 --> 02:24.796
I'm not doing anymore
birthday party gigs.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.450
They're soul-crushing.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.322
This one's different.

02:28.365 --> 02:31.847
This one's for a producer
who works for Bob Costas.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.458
No.
No birthdays.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.765
This could open all kinds
of doors for you, honey.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.419
-ROXY:
-On-air opportunities.

02:38.462 --> 02:40.290
Hard pass.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.639
Are we done?

02:41.683 --> 02:44.816
Yeah... You--
no, really, honey, um,

02:44.860 --> 02:47.645
I-I don't think
I made myself clear here.

02:47.689 --> 02:50.431
Uh, you have to do this gig,
Roxy.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.824
DIANE: We have a contract
with these people

02:52.868 --> 02:54.913
and we can't afford
to be held in breach.

02:59.396 --> 03:03.270
I am so sick
of being paraded around

03:03.313 --> 03:06.708
like a circus freak with
a 15-year-old silver medal.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.886
That's not who I am anymore.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.453
Really?

03:14.411 --> 03:15.717
So who are you?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.501
Yes.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.503
We're dying to know.

03:25.335 --> 03:26.336
Give me the address.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.473
RON: Thanks, sweetheart.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.479
JUDGE: The prosecution
requests a continuance?

03:38.522 --> 03:41.699
Our key witness can't be in New
York until after the new year.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.354
You've accused my client
of assaulting dozens of women.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.530
You can't find one
who can testify before then?

03:46.574 --> 03:48.315
She's a public school teacher.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.708
We shouldn't penalize her
for educating our children.

03:50.752 --> 03:52.623
An admirable stance,

03:52.667 --> 03:54.538
but Ms. Palmer
makes a valid point.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.410
Find another key witness.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.373
I understand
if you're freaking out.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.374
I'm not.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.724
I--I've been there.
I get it.

04:06.768 --> 04:07.899
Amanda, it was a mistake.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.075
Was it?

04:10.119 --> 04:12.295
I can't blow up my life
over this.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.558
I--it just--

04:14.602 --> 04:16.430
-It's a lot.
-Look, it's okay, okay?

04:16.473 --> 04:18.606
I can be patient.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.869
You aren't my first freaked
out, first-time lesbian.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.305
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.786
How many first time,
freaked-out lesbians have you--

04:24.829 --> 04:26.875
Gotten freaky with?

04:26.918 --> 04:27.832
I mean--

04:27.876 --> 04:29.965
I'm married

04:30.008 --> 04:31.880
to an amazing guy.

04:31.923 --> 04:34.012
I...

04:34.056 --> 04:37.451
Getting involved
with opposing counsel--

04:37.494 --> 04:38.756
talk about a rookie mistake.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.106
I can't, I--

04:41.150 --> 04:44.414
And yet, here we are.

04:44.458 --> 04:49.071
Look, if you wanna stop,
we stop, but...

04:49.114 --> 04:50.899
I think we have something here.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.860
Something more than
just a one-time thing.

04:55.904 --> 04:59.342
And we're both professionals
so we keep it that way, right?

04:59.386 --> 05:00.648
Keep the business, business,

05:00.691 --> 05:03.607
and the personal, personal.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.393
See where it leads.

06:19.553 --> 06:22.120
No secrets or lies.

06:22.164 --> 06:25.733
Uh, you've grown into a very
confident young woman, Edie.

06:25.776 --> 06:28.126
I'd like you to take me through
each instance

06:28.170 --> 06:30.520
in which you were the donor
as best you can recall.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.043
We could be looking
at a count for each,

06:32.087 --> 06:33.784
so it's important
to be thorough.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.830

06:42.140 --> 06:43.533
Of course.

06:47.755 --> 06:50.932
Oh, yeah, that was always
a favorite Thanksgiving of mine.

06:53.108 --> 06:55.850

06:55.893 --> 06:57.895
Uh, yeah, nine.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.593
You were a little lawyer
even then.

06:59.636 --> 07:02.204
Stickler for accuracy.

07:02.247 --> 07:04.554
You used to torment Genevieve.

what you said.

pick this back up at the office.

07:54.343 --> 07:55.518
They're supposed to be.

08:32.947 --> 08:35.645
Nice to meet you.
You wanna try it again?

08:35.689 --> 08:36.864
Keep your feet together.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.566
Yeah, Bechley.
That's right.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.176
It's me.

Really?

08:50.094 --> 08:52.009
I wanted to talk to you
to apologize.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.228
I forgive you.
Now go.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.490
Kim found my phone

08:54.534 --> 08:56.057
and that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.363
My marriage is a very--

08:58.407 --> 09:01.062
Complicated situation.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.063
Please don't insult
my intelligence

09:03.194 --> 09:04.108
You are the last person

09:04.152 --> 09:05.370
that I wanted to see right now.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.198
-I get that.
-Then why am I still seeing you?

09:07.242 --> 09:10.071
Because this is messing
with my life, too, okay?

09:10.114 --> 09:12.073
I work at a very
conservative firm.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.378

a lot of heat for this.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.077
Are you?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.295
Are you getting
a lot of heat for this,

09:17.339 --> 09:18.688
because I'm getting burned
at the stake,

09:18.732 --> 09:20.342
and I didn't cheat
on anyone or lie

09:20.385 --> 09:22.692
or do anything except
use modern technology

09:22.736 --> 09:25.608
to have quick, consensual,
and fairly unmemorable sex.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.262
So no, I don't care
about your problems.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.046
I need you to leave
and never come back

09:29.090 --> 09:30.134

come back around ♪

09:54.376 --> 09:57.074
♪ I am being interested

09:57.118 --> 10:00.121
♪ Whoa, whoa

10:02.297 --> 10:05.256
My question is,
were you attracted to him

10:05.300 --> 10:07.171
despite the genetic connection
or because of it?

10:07.215 --> 10:10.740
Because I'm not sure
which one's more upsetting.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.263
I am not available
for your teasing right now.

10:12.307 --> 10:14.657
I am walking through
a living nightmare.

10:14.701 --> 10:15.919
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.921
I couldn't resist.
It must be really awful.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.880
You have no idea.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.839
Well, do you wanna
tell me what's up?

10:22.883 --> 10:24.798
I'm assuming that's not for me.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.277
I'm going
to a client bris later,

10:26.321 --> 10:27.322
or believe me,

10:27.365 --> 10:29.106
I would be in bed
under the covers.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.760
Well, you said
you wanted to meet.

10:30.804 --> 10:32.893
I told you I was too busy and
you said it couldn't wait, so...

10:34.721 --> 10:36.940
Edie, I saw you

10:36.984 --> 10:40.291
with that DA,
Amanda Doherty,

10:40.335 --> 10:42.337
in the courthouse.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.082
I'm not sure
what you think you saw.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.171
I think I saw you
kissing the woman

10:50.214 --> 10:52.956
who is prosecuting the case
against my father.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.960
It was nothing.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.048
And it's none of your business.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.267
Is it nothing
or none of my business,

10:59.310 --> 11:01.399
because those are two
very different things.

11:01.443 --> 11:04.272
It doesn't matter because
it's over, okay?

11:04.315 --> 11:06.970
Edie, I'm not trying to tell you
how to live your life.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.798
-Because--
-Oh, great.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.321
Thank you, Julia, because you're
not exactly the first person

11:10.365 --> 11:12.715
I'd go to for life advice.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.717
If you are--I don't know,

11:14.761 --> 11:16.327
going through something or
struggling with your sexuality--

11:16.371 --> 11:18.852
I'm not struggling.

11:18.895 --> 11:22.029
I'm happily married to the
greatest guy in the world.

11:22.072 --> 11:24.727
I know.

11:24.771 --> 11:25.728
I made one dumb decision.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.339
With serious consequences.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.994
I don't understand why you would
wanna jeopardize my dad's case,

11:31.038 --> 11:34.171
not to mention
your entire career

11:34.215 --> 11:36.086
unless this is--
this is who you are.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.740
Are you--

11:37.784 --> 11:39.307
do you like women,
or you have always liked women,

11:39.350 --> 11:41.048
or are you a lesbia--
are you dating the prosecutor?

11:41.091 --> 11:42.136
Keep your voice down.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.877
Please.

11:43.920 --> 11:47.054
We do not all need to be
Internet notorious.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.316
I was literally whispering.

11:48.359 --> 11:50.361
I couldn't have been any softer.

11:51.493 --> 11:54.322
Look, if you wanna blow up
your life, that's fine,

11:54.365 --> 11:56.193
but I'm not gonna
let you blow up mine

11:56.237 --> 11:57.891
and my father's in the process.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.544
I have it under control, okay?

11:59.588 --> 12:01.764
As for the blowing up
your life thing,

12:01.808 --> 12:04.027
I think you're doing a pretty
good job of it on your own.

12:08.815 --> 12:12.079
Come on, people.
What is wrong with you?

12:12.122 --> 12:13.428
-Let it go.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.867
Hi.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.306
Debbie, mazel tov.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.047
Julia, you came.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.180
Yeah, of course.
I RSVP-ed, didn't I?

12:26.223 --> 12:29.096
I would love to hold the little
guy before the action starts.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.880
Oh, I'm--

12:30.924 --> 12:33.927
I'm afraid I--
I can't let you do that.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.580
Oh, right.
It's a big day.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.191
Needs to keep his game face on.

12:37.234 --> 12:40.803
No, I can't let you come inside
I have a lot of family here.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.849
They're very
conservative people.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.418
Oh.

12:47.462 --> 12:51.248
Oh, my God.
This is about the, um--right.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.468
Debbie, that--
that was a mistake.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.862
That's not who I am.

12:55.905 --> 12:58.865
It sure looked like you
in the video.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.432
I'm sorry, Julia,
this is a religious ceremony.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.434
We just can't have
the distraction.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.136
Right.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.094
Okay, fine.

13:11.138 --> 13:13.444
Yeah, I'll just--I'll just go,

13:13.488 --> 13:15.925
and I'm gonna
take these onesies with me

13:15.969 --> 13:18.885
because they're
friggin' adorable.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.235
I--what am I gonna do with them?
Here.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.366
Mazel tov.

13:22.410 --> 13:25.848
Thank you, Julia.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.512
Okay, let's try this again.

13:37.555 --> 13:40.515
I am your lawyer.
You are my client.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.299
There will be no talking
about Thanksgiving

13:42.343 --> 13:43.779
or when Julia and I were kids.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.346
Just business.
Got it?

13:45.389 --> 13:46.477
Yes.

13:47.652 --> 13:48.697
Why are you smiling?

13:48.740 --> 13:50.481
You actually just
reminded me of me--

13:50.525 --> 13:52.614
Leon, please.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.572
Tell me about the first time
you intervened.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.792
Intervened?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.446
Not a word I would use.

13:58.489 --> 13:59.664
Use your own, then.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.449
Okay.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.451
Now, in the early '80s,

14:03.494 --> 14:05.975
technology wasn't
what it is now.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.021
We didn't have
the same storage capabilities.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.632
Now, the client in this case--

14:10.675 --> 14:13.069
she had already endured,
you know,

14:13.113 --> 14:15.028
multiple failed attempts
at conception.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.638
Now, at the time,

14:16.681 --> 14:18.814
you know, we suspected
the husband was the problem.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.122
She was ovulating.
The situation was optimal.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.645
But the husband--

14:23.688 --> 14:26.604
you know, he wouldn't admit
that maybe he was the problem.

14:26.648 --> 14:30.043
He refused to submit
to testing his sperm.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.392
So they were ready to give up.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.394
Now, she came to me

14:33.437 --> 14:36.527
and she was desperate for
anything that might, you know,

14:36.571 --> 14:38.747
produce a viable pregnancy.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.967
She begged me for help--

14:41.010 --> 14:43.926
help in any way I could.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.145
Her words.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.842
So you helped her?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.452
Oh, who was I
to get in the way of motherhood

14:48.496 --> 14:50.063
when I knew
I could create success?

14:50.106 --> 14:54.632
She deserved to have the
next piece in her life story.

14:54.676 --> 14:57.070
You know, sometimes, the
universe can't wait for science.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.986
That's good.
It sounds compassionate.

15:00.029 --> 15:03.032
If you tell it just like that,
the jury will respond.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.251
-That's a good story.
-Yeah, but no, it's no--

15:04.294 --> 15:06.383
I mean, it's not a story.
It's the truth.

15:07.732 --> 15:10.170
What, do you--
I mean, do you believe me?

15:10.213 --> 15:11.998
Doesn't matter if I believe you.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.825
It helps make
a personal connection.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.045
If the jury feels something,

15:16.089 --> 15:17.960
it only benefits our side.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.703
I know you can handle a jury.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.140
It's like that pro bono case,
Malcolm Bradley.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.708
-What?
-Yeah, you were right.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.536
He never should've
been tried as an adult.

15:28.579 --> 15:31.452
How do you know about that?

15:31.495 --> 15:33.454
You've had a successful career.

15:33.497 --> 15:35.021
I--I followed it.

15:35.064 --> 15:39.025
That case in particular
stayed with me.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.765
You know, the other cases,
you know, showed your savvy,

15:40.809 --> 15:43.725
but that one,
that showed your heart.

15:43.768 --> 15:46.119
You followed my career?

15:46.162 --> 15:49.122
I've been invested in you
your entire life.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.211
Invested?

15:51.254 --> 15:55.432
Just, you know, that
you're a very talented lawyer.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.001
Uh-huh.

15:59.045 --> 16:02.048
You know, I think--
I think we should take a break.

16:03.919 --> 16:07.227
Edie, for the record,
I don't care about the jury.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.011
I care about you.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.457
Yeah, crushed it.

16:20.501 --> 16:24.070
Hey, #Roxycontin.
It's our turn.

16:24.113 --> 16:26.637
ROXY: Bring it on back.
Let's see another one.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.991
That's my nanny's kid.
I didn't even invite her.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.603
Okay.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.257
Don't pay attention
to her, okay?

16:37.300 --> 16:40.477
She's just jealous because
you have talent,

16:40.521 --> 16:44.786
and she's just a rich,
spoiled bitch, okay?

16:44.829 --> 16:46.005
Okay?

16:46.048 --> 16:47.571
All right.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.969
Listen, birthday girl,

16:54.013 --> 16:56.537
you've never done a hard day's
work in your life.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.496
At the ranch,
they'd tape your knees together

16:59.540 --> 17:01.150
and put you
on a saltine cracker diet

17:01.194 --> 17:03.892
until you were begging
for mercy.

17:03.935 --> 17:06.068
And you wouldn't last a day.

17:07.548 --> 17:10.159
CAITLYN: Daddy!

17:10.203 --> 17:11.856
I think you owe us an apology.

17:14.685 --> 17:17.253
Okay.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.125
I'm sorry.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.127
I'm sorry your daughter's
a spoiled weakling

17:21.170 --> 17:22.606
who's had every obstacle

17:22.650 --> 17:24.130
snowplowed out of the way
by her parents.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.827
-Get out!
-Yeah, way ahead of you, pal.

17:27.785 --> 17:30.136
Hey, keep tumbling, okay?

18:10.741 --> 18:11.699
It will.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.004
Well, no.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.137
The Internet is forever,
but eventually,

18:15.181 --> 18:16.312
you won't be trending
at number one.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.186
-That's not encouraging.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.231
Okay, we're just gonna
wait this crap out.

18:22.275 --> 18:25.147
Meanwhile, you can't sit up
in here and sulk all day.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.018
You have a whole team out there
that's counting on you.

18:29.151 --> 18:32.154
Isaac, I really need you
to hear what I'm about to say.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.287
I'm not leaving this chair

18:34.330 --> 18:36.115
or this sweatshirt

18:36.158 --> 18:37.638
ever.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.075
Hey, hey.
Julia.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.817
-ISAAC: Come on.
-JULIA:

18:44.123 --> 18:45.994
-Unabomber, come on.
-No.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.127
Okay, you need to get up.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.302
Take your sweatshirt off.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.086
Go to the staff meeting.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.001
Hold your head high,

18:53.044 --> 18:55.308
and let them know
that this #brotherhumper

18:55.351 --> 18:57.310
is not gonna take this crap
lying down.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.791
You and I are partners,
remember?

19:00.835 --> 19:03.664
A team.

19:03.707 --> 19:04.969
I need you.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.193
All right.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.152
Okay.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.371
But I'm still the boss bitch.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.417
You're still the boss bitch.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.119
How do I look?

19:37.915 --> 19:39.700
KIM : Didn't you
know he was your brother?

19:39.743 --> 19:42.398
Yeah, my husband
is her brother!

19:42.442 --> 19:43.921
JULIA : Okay, no--

19:43.965 --> 19:45.532
KIM : She had sex
with her own brother,

19:45.575 --> 19:48.012
And yet here she is,
trying to help all of you.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.542
JULIA: Hey, it's Julia.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.021
You know what to do.

19:57.065 --> 20:00.677
Hey, I brought the Nelson file
for you to look over.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.943
What about the Andersons
and the Gottliebs?

20:07.684 --> 20:09.425
No longer clients?

20:10.426 --> 20:12.646
Mm, I see.

20:12.689 --> 20:13.951
Have you seen this?

20:15.518 --> 20:16.476
I have.

20:16.519 --> 20:17.607
Yeah.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.265
How's she holding up?

20:25.398 --> 20:26.964
Not so great.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.532
I mean, it's one thing for them
to, you know, come after me,

20:29.576 --> 20:31.752
but my daughter?

20:31.795 --> 20:32.970
It's killing me, Isaac.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.058
Yeah, I understand, it's--

20:34.102 --> 20:36.365
No, I'm not sure you do.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.367
I mean, it is killing me.

20:38.411 --> 20:39.977
She won't take my calls.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.677
What's--what's the plan?

20:45.548 --> 20:46.810
PR people say we lay low.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.421
-Eh, that PR.
-Wait it out.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.336
PR people are idiots.

20:50.379 --> 20:53.469
No--politically-correct wusses,

20:53.513 --> 20:55.341
saying that we should
sit on our heels.

20:55.384 --> 20:57.560
Meanwhile, my daughter
is being raked over the coals

20:57.604 --> 20:59.780
for something
that is entirely my fault.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.086
Leon, we're not even
supposed to meet at all.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.914
I think we should just
stick to the patients.

21:03.958 --> 21:07.135
Now, for the Nelsons, the 26th
looks optimal for egg retrieval.

21:07.178 --> 21:09.572
This has to land on me,
all right?

21:09.616 --> 21:10.878
Not Julia.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.793
You have to tell Julia
that she needs to,

21:12.836 --> 21:14.098
you know,
create a new narrative.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.622
She needs to get out
in front of this.

21:15.665 --> 21:18.451
She needs to fight back
and she has to remind people

21:18.494 --> 21:20.496
that I'm the villain
of the story.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.715
But it has to come from you

21:21.758 --> 21:23.717
'cause she's not listening to me
right now.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.023
Sir, I don't--
I don't think I can--

21:26.067 --> 21:27.721
Yes, you can,

21:27.764 --> 21:29.810
because you care about her
as much as anyone.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.855
-Leon, I--
-LEON: Isaac.

21:32.943 --> 21:33.814
Please.

21:35.511 --> 21:39.994
Now, look, I agree
with you on the 26th--

21:40.037 --> 21:42.866
the Nelsons, egg retrieval--

21:42.910 --> 21:44.999
because as usual...

21:45.042 --> 21:47.044
You're right.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.048
And as for the--you know,

21:51.092 --> 21:52.485
the Andersons and the Gottliebs,
you know,

21:52.528 --> 21:55.009
you just tell them
they can rot in hell.

21:58.099 --> 22:00.144
KIM : She had sex
with her own brother!

22:00.188 --> 22:01.842
She had sex
with her own brother!

22:01.885 --> 22:04.061
-She had sex with her own...
-Wow.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.672
It's auto-tuned and everything.

22:05.715 --> 22:06.934
KIM : She had sex
with her own brother!

22:06.977 --> 22:08.457
You know, I gotta say
it is kinda catchy.

22:08.501 --> 22:09.937
KIM :
Her own brother!

22:09.980 --> 22:11.504
She had sex with her own bro--

22:11.547 --> 22:13.854
You know, in, like,
a super mean-spirited,

22:13.897 --> 22:15.377
uncool kind of way.

22:16.857 --> 22:18.989
Look, don't worry.
We're gonna fix this, okay?

22:19.033 --> 22:20.121
I got a guy.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.428
He does search engine
optimization.

22:22.471 --> 22:24.908
I used him for that DUI I got
two days before trials.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.388
There is no fixing this.

22:26.432 --> 22:29.435
I'm branded for life
with a scarlet hashtag.

22:29.478 --> 22:30.871
The Internet is forever.

22:30.914 --> 22:33.177
Hey, didn't you just
clean those cups?

22:33.221 --> 22:34.701
I'm cleaning them again.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.659
It's the one thing in my life
I can control right now.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.879
Sis, you and I
are not that different.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.098
Not sure that's helping.

22:41.142 --> 22:43.405
People wanna brand me too,
you know?

22:43.449 --> 22:44.885
"Roxycontin."

22:44.928 --> 22:47.583
-It's a good pun.
-Screw those losers.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.585
Okay, here he is.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.413
So he can't
scrub you completely,

22:51.457 --> 22:53.720
but he can push all this stuff
down to the tenth search page.

22:55.199 --> 22:56.984
ROXY: I just need $10,000.

22:57.027 --> 22:57.985
What?

23:00.727 --> 23:01.902
Oh.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.773
Hello, tall.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.601
Hey, uh, is Julia here?

23:05.645 --> 23:06.776
Hey.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.082
Hey.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.738
So, um,

23:11.781 --> 23:14.088
why don't I whip us up
a couple Hot Pockets?

23:14.131 --> 23:15.785
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

23:17.787 --> 23:18.788
What are you doing here?

23:20.616 --> 23:21.835
I think you should fight this.

23:21.878 --> 23:23.097
Fight it?

23:23.140 --> 23:24.707
I thought you said
that we should wait it out.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.056
The PR people said--

23:26.100 --> 23:29.146
The PR people are
politically-correct wusses.

23:29.190 --> 23:31.845
Listen, what if you made
a statement, all right?

23:31.888 --> 23:33.673
You're not this person that
they're dragging on Twitter.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.283
Why don't you just show them
who you really are?

23:35.326 --> 23:37.764
That will definitely
make things worse.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.113
I mean, it's me.

23:39.156 --> 23:42.072
Definitely will not
make things worse.

23:42.116 --> 23:43.291
If people see you--

23:43.334 --> 23:45.815
I mean, if they see
who you really are,

23:45.859 --> 23:47.600
people would fall in love
with you.

23:49.819 --> 23:52.866
I mean, just don't wear
your normal clothes

23:52.909 --> 23:54.607
and put a brush
through your hair, but...

23:56.217 --> 23:58.132
I don't know.
No.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.961
Will you at least
think about it?

24:01.004 --> 24:02.745
Okay.

24:02.789 --> 24:05.052
Cool, yeah.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.533
-That's all I got.
-Okay.

24:07.576 --> 24:09.709
And have fun
with the Hot Pockets.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.798
-JULIA: All right, see you.

24:11.841 --> 24:14.670
-Whoa.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.324
I think tall guy
speaks the truth.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.326
Jeez.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.154
-You were listening?
-Not intentionally.

24:20.197 --> 24:22.156
I have insanely-good hearing.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.244
Is he single?

24:23.287 --> 24:25.594
Tall guy.
He's Isaac.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.161
Um, I suppose?

24:27.204 --> 24:29.598
And you're sure you're not,
you know...

24:29.642 --> 24:31.557
Ew.
No.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.123
-Mm.
-Why?

24:33.167 --> 24:35.082
Oh, uh, no reason.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.524
MAN: Beautiful form.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.048
That is one of Roxy's
signature skills.

24:45.092 --> 24:47.224
She combines such grace
with incredible athleticism...

24:47.268 --> 24:49.052
Okay, come on.

24:49.096 --> 24:50.576
-Come on.
-MAN: And now her dismount.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.273
Come on, Roxy.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.666
MAN: She's been landing these
throughout the competition.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.145
MAN:
Roxy Doyle for the silver.

24:55.189 --> 24:57.539
-Nice, nice.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.718
-What, Mom?
-DIANE: I'll tell you what.

25:02.762 --> 25:05.591
I just spoke to our client
and he is not happy.

25:05.634 --> 25:08.202
Oh, really?
Well, that makes two of us.

25:08.245 --> 25:10.596
You made his daughter cry?

25:10.639 --> 25:12.598
You don't know how nasty
she was to me.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.991
Do you know what she said?
How humiliating that was?

25:15.035 --> 25:16.340
DIANE : You're
going right back over there

25:16.384 --> 25:17.603
and saying you're sorry.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.213
We cannot afford this.

25:19.256 --> 25:22.477
Your reputation is hanging
on here by a thread as it is.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.392
Did you hear anything
that I just said?

25:24.435 --> 25:26.612
-It was a horrible experience.

25:26.655 --> 25:28.570
I can't take
that kind of thing anymore.

25:28.614 --> 25:29.745
DIANE :
It's okay, honey.

25:29.789 --> 25:32.139
Mommy's got you.

25:32.182 --> 25:34.228
-She's so sweet.

25:36.752 --> 25:37.797
You know, for a minute there,

25:37.840 --> 25:39.625
I thought you were
talking to me.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.365
I wish I could be
Mitch Gaylord for a day

25:41.409 --> 25:43.803
to see what it feels like
to have your unconditional love.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.500
That's ridiculous.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.502
-Oh, is it?
-DIANE : Yes.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.678
Now, I need you to go over there
and apologize.

25:49.722 --> 25:52.507
This is important
for your future.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.205
Yeah, I know what's important
to you, Diane.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.779
-Hey, I'm so glad you called.
-Hey, Ma.

26:03.823 --> 26:06.565
So how you doing
with everything?

26:06.608 --> 26:07.783
I know it's all so--

26:07.827 --> 26:09.698
-I'm okay.
-Oh.

26:12.222 --> 26:14.050
Well, you look great.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.661
Did you add vitamin D
to your diet?

26:15.704 --> 26:17.053
Are things better with Tim?
I don't know.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.402
You got this glow.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.839
Uh, no.

26:19.882 --> 26:21.449
Yes?

26:21.492 --> 26:23.190
Okay, well, I--
I made the matcha.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.583
It's ready.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.888
What did you wanna talk about?

26:25.932 --> 26:28.325
Well, I've been working
with Leon this week.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.240
Oh, yeah.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.372
How's the case going?

26:31.415 --> 26:32.678
It's--it's interesting.

26:32.721 --> 26:36.420
He's--he seems to know
a lot about my career.

26:36.464 --> 26:39.510
Well, you know Leon.
He's always taken an interest.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.817
"Investment"
was the word he used.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.733
Oh.
Hm.

26:44.777 --> 26:48.302
What did he mean by that, Mom?

26:48.345 --> 26:49.782
Well, I really don't know.

26:51.392 --> 26:52.785
Mom.

26:52.828 --> 26:55.701
I really don't have time
to do this thing that we do,

26:55.744 --> 26:57.833
and you kinda
forfeited the privilege,

26:57.877 --> 27:00.401
so can we just...

27:03.447 --> 27:06.233
Leon's been helping you
since college.

27:06.276 --> 27:09.715
And it was a good thing.
It is a good thing.

27:09.758 --> 27:12.456
So there's no need
for any drama.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.763
Helping me how?

27:14.807 --> 27:16.460
Financially?

27:16.504 --> 27:19.115
Well, he set aside some money

27:19.159 --> 27:22.423
for a sort of scholarship.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.643
You mean
the Young Leaders Scholarship?

27:29.691 --> 27:31.214
Mom, I--

27:31.258 --> 27:32.302
I thought that was
a merit scholarship.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.261
I thought I--I wrote that essay.

27:34.304 --> 27:36.611
I thought I earned that.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.439
And you knew all along
and you just...

27:41.964 --> 27:43.226
I gotta go.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.707
Honey, please.

27:45.751 --> 27:48.231
Good talk.
Thanks, Mom.

27:57.806 --> 28:00.591
-Nice look.
-Better to be safe than sorry.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.464
Can I--

28:06.946 --> 28:09.731
No one's gonna
recognize you here.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.647
Wow, yeah, what--
where is here?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.388
Why are you staying
in this place?

28:14.431 --> 28:16.390
Uh, it's cheap.

28:16.433 --> 28:18.479
And when your
incestuous infidelity

28:18.522 --> 28:20.133
gets blasted
all over the Internet,

28:20.176 --> 28:23.440
your wife tends to kick you out
and your boss tends to fire you.

28:24.877 --> 28:28.315
Well, that's why married guys
shouldn't be on dating apps.

28:28.358 --> 28:30.317
I know.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.841
It's for single people.

28:32.885 --> 28:34.321
Very single.

28:34.364 --> 28:35.931
You, not single.

28:37.585 --> 28:39.369
You lied to me, Sam.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.590
Really sorry, Julia.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.331
Why'd you do it?

28:44.374 --> 28:46.594
I don't know.

28:46.637 --> 28:49.336
I had a good life.
I had everything.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.642
I deserve this.

28:51.686 --> 28:55.342
Well, I don't know
if I deserve this.

28:55.385 --> 28:57.257
Yeah, so in summary,

28:57.300 --> 28:59.520
we both feel humiliated,

28:59.563 --> 29:01.957
vulnerable, exposed.

29:02.001 --> 29:03.567
Yeah.

29:03.611 --> 29:04.873
When you came to the clinic,

29:04.917 --> 29:07.441
you said we needed
to do something.

29:07.484 --> 29:10.618
So let's do something.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.797
Hey, Nick.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.017
Um, Roxy Doyle.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.846
Hey.
Mitch isn't quite ready yet.

29:20.889 --> 29:22.412
You know,
your mom said she'd be back.

29:22.456 --> 29:24.501
Yeah, I know, but she had--
she had something come up,

29:24.545 --> 29:26.286
and she asked me to grab him.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.854
And I'm kind of
in a hurry, so...

29:28.897 --> 29:30.638
I should probably
just call her to make sure.

29:30.681 --> 29:35.251
You know what?
He looks ready to me, so...

29:35.295 --> 29:37.384
Hey, what're you doing?
You can't be back there.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.429
No!

29:48.874 --> 29:50.005
-DIANE: Hello?
-JULIA: Okay, okay.

29:50.049 --> 29:51.311
-Keep your pants on.
-DIANE: Roxy!

29:51.354 --> 29:53.313
DIANE: I know you're in there.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.184
Roxy!

29:55.228 --> 29:58.187
Oh.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.363
-You must be--
-Roxy's mother.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.017
Right.
I'm Julia.

30:02.061 --> 30:04.237
I know who you are.
Now where's my baby?

30:04.280 --> 30:06.369
She's probably sleeping.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.850
My dog.
Where are you keeping him?

30:08.894 --> 30:09.982
I'm--I'm sorry, Mrs. Doyle.

30:10.025 --> 30:10.983
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.288
There's definitely no dog here.

30:13.942 --> 30:16.031
Ooh, there you are.

30:16.075 --> 30:17.511
Oh, my sweet boy.

30:17.554 --> 30:20.514
Aww, I was worried sick.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.037
Really?
You were worried sick?

30:22.081 --> 30:23.386
I can't take care of a dog?

30:23.430 --> 30:25.214
Okay, I have no idea
where he came from.

30:25.258 --> 30:26.999
I don't know what
you're capable of anymore.

30:27.042 --> 30:29.044
I know you wanna hurt me.
That much seems clear.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.437
He is my dog too.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.265
Maybe I just missed him.
Did you ever think of that?

30:32.308 --> 30:33.919
Yeah, my lease
doesn't allow pets.

30:33.962 --> 30:36.051
Name one time you've ever gotten
up in the morning to walk him.

30:36.095 --> 30:37.879
Huh?
You can't.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.881
You can't even take care
of yourself.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.143
You're a mess, Roxy.

30:41.187 --> 30:43.102
Okay, Mrs. Doyle,

30:43.145 --> 30:44.973
I know that you are very upset
about losing your dog--

30:45.017 --> 30:47.410
You should stay out of this,
brother humper.

30:47.454 --> 30:50.109
And no, I did not lose my dog.
He was stolen.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.415
You can't steal
your own dog, okay?

30:52.459 --> 30:53.895
Nice try, Diane.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.201
Ugh, just give me the dog.

30:55.244 --> 30:57.333
-No, stop, stop.
-JULIA: Hey, hey, hey, stop.

30:57.377 --> 30:59.248
We need to call a truce here.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.597
Okay?

31:00.641 --> 31:03.035
-Can I have the dog?
-Just be careful.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.300
Okay, I'm guessing little...

31:07.343 --> 31:09.302
BOTH: Mitch Gaylord.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.520
Of course.

31:10.564 --> 31:13.219
I'm guessing little Mitch
might be happier

31:13.262 --> 31:16.918
with his yard
to run around in, right?

31:16.962 --> 31:19.094
And I'm guessing you,
Mrs. Doyle,

31:19.138 --> 31:21.096
are being a little bit more
hurtful than normal

31:21.140 --> 31:22.532
because in addition
to losing your dog,

31:22.576 --> 31:24.926
you also feel like
you're losing your daughter.

31:26.536 --> 31:28.103
Now,

31:28.147 --> 31:31.846
I will give you back the dog
if you promise to

31:31.890 --> 31:33.935
just give Roxy some space.

31:35.110 --> 31:37.286
Because she's...

31:37.330 --> 31:39.201
an adult,

31:39.245 --> 31:42.596
and very capable
of taking care of herself.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.425
Does that seem fair?

31:48.341 --> 31:49.951
None of this is fair.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.533
You okay?

32:06.576 --> 32:08.970
Thanks for sticking up for me.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.189
It's no big deal.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.496
It is.

32:13.540 --> 32:15.281
Sticking up for people
is a big deal.

32:29.643 --> 32:33.168
Listen, I wanna make something
really clear to you, Leon,

32:33.212 --> 32:34.474
before we continue
with anything.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.345
Well, sure.
I mean, you're in charge.

32:37.564 --> 32:39.131
Everything I've done,

32:39.174 --> 32:41.220
I have done on my own.

32:41.263 --> 32:43.004
My career, my accomplishments--

32:43.048 --> 32:45.050
you have no idea
how much harder you have to work

32:45.093 --> 32:46.399
as a young, black woman.

32:46.442 --> 32:48.531
And I will not let you or anyone

32:48.575 --> 32:51.143
undermine me or confuse me.

32:51.186 --> 32:52.274
I know who I am.

32:52.318 --> 32:54.537
And I'm--I'm very proud of you.

32:54.581 --> 32:55.974
EDIE: No.
That's just it.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.541
It's not about you.
You don't get to take credit.

32:58.585 --> 32:59.673
Take credit?

32:59.716 --> 33:01.631
Or--or be proud or whatever.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.200
The Young Leaders Scholarship?

33:05.244 --> 33:06.723
Catchy title.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.247
I didn't win anything.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.465
I wrote a pitch-perfect essay

33:09.509 --> 33:11.554
about Jane Bolin's
first judicial ruling.

33:11.598 --> 33:13.078
Nobody even read it.

33:13.121 --> 33:14.644
I read it.

33:14.688 --> 33:17.952
Yeah, well, I worked my ass off.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.562
-You wrote a check.
-Your mother and I--

33:19.606 --> 33:22.217
You created a bogus scholarship
so that you could participate

33:22.261 --> 33:24.002
so that you could feel good

33:24.045 --> 33:25.742
like you actually had
anything to do with me.

33:25.786 --> 33:28.745
I saw your potential.

33:28.789 --> 33:31.313
You knew what things were like
for me growing up, Leon.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.098
And that's why I wanted to help.

33:33.141 --> 33:34.621
EDIE: I didn't need a handout.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.406
I needed a father.

33:39.452 --> 33:42.498
All those Thanksgivings I sat
across from you, and you knew.

33:44.109 --> 33:46.111
Why didn't you ever tell me
who you really were?

33:48.635 --> 33:51.159
Were you ever gonna tell me?

33:54.510 --> 33:57.252
A lot of people would've
gotten hurt if I had told you.

34:06.305 --> 34:08.350
Mr. Marcus will
be right with you.

34:08.394 --> 34:09.351
Thanks.

34:13.703 --> 34:14.661
Hey.

34:14.704 --> 34:16.358
Hi.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.752
Are you in trouble
'cause of the party?

34:18.795 --> 34:20.188
Did you come
to say you're sorry?

34:20.232 --> 34:22.364
No, I'm here to see you.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.152
Why?

34:27.195 --> 34:29.241
Well, because

34:29.284 --> 34:31.808
you remind me of someone
I know who discovered

34:31.852 --> 34:35.073
they had this superpower
when they were about your age.

34:35.116 --> 34:36.291
Who's that?

34:36.335 --> 34:37.510
Me.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.209
I don't feel like
I have a superpower.

34:41.253 --> 34:42.515
Well, that's just because
you haven't figured out

34:42.558 --> 34:44.517
how to use it yet.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.649
-But I can help you.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.521
-Think you can work hard?
-Yeah.

34:48.564 --> 34:49.696
Okay.

34:50.784 --> 34:53.178
But my mom's just a nanny.

34:53.221 --> 34:55.658
She probably can't pay.

34:55.702 --> 34:57.138
It's okay.
We'll figure something out.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.184
Hit me up on the socials, okay?

35:24.209 --> 35:26.515
Hi, it's Julia Bechley.

35:26.559 --> 35:28.300
And I'm here with Sam McCormick.

35:28.343 --> 35:29.388
Hi, there.

35:29.431 --> 35:30.389
And we just thought
it was important

35:30.432 --> 35:32.173
to set the record straight.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.741
-This is my brother.
-And this is my sister.

35:34.784 --> 35:37.439
And we did have sex.

35:37.483 --> 35:40.138
-Yep, that happened.
-It did.

35:40.181 --> 35:43.532
Listen, we didn't know
that we were...

35:43.576 --> 35:46.187
When we were...
You get it.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.885
Anyway, ever since
we found out we were related,

35:48.929 --> 35:52.367
our worlds have pretty much
been turned upside down.

35:52.411 --> 35:54.413
It tested us.

35:54.456 --> 35:56.328
Tested me.

35:56.371 --> 35:58.895
Everything I thought
I knew about my life--

35:58.939 --> 36:02.116
who my family was,
what my identity is--

36:02.160 --> 36:04.292
has changed.

36:04.336 --> 36:07.730
I have brothers and sisters
that I didn't even know about

36:07.774 --> 36:10.516
until a couple weeks ago--
tons of them.

36:10.559 --> 36:13.345
And I get wanting to make me
the laughingstock.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.782
I mean,
the #brotherhumper thing?

36:15.825 --> 36:18.393
Genuinely funny.

36:18.437 --> 36:22.397
But I'm a person with feelings.

36:22.441 --> 36:25.313
I know that I have
a lot more family out there.

36:25.357 --> 36:28.621
And I know this isn't
just happening me.

36:28.664 --> 36:30.927
One in ten people has a father

36:30.971 --> 36:32.886
that isn't really
their father.

36:32.929 --> 36:34.714
And these are the people
that I wanna help

36:34.757 --> 36:36.716
'cause you are my family.

36:38.544 --> 36:42.852
Leon Bechley is my father,
but I'm not like him.

36:44.637 --> 36:45.942
You hear me, Dad?

36:45.986 --> 36:47.509
I don't know
if you're watching this,

36:47.553 --> 36:49.772
but if you are,

36:49.816 --> 36:51.470
I'm not you.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.907
I'm honest about who I am.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.518
I'm not hiding.

36:56.562 --> 36:58.564
I'm not going anywhere.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.827
I'm right here.

37:12.273 --> 37:13.840
Wanna burn some sage with that?

37:13.883 --> 37:15.233
'Cause I got some.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.799
-It's tempting.

37:19.019 --> 37:21.369
"Won't deny it.
Still shipping Sam and Julia.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.328

37:23.371 --> 37:25.025
Better to be shipped
than shamed.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.200
Oh, I'll take it.

37:30.204 --> 37:31.118
It worked.

37:31.161 --> 37:33.816
Your crazy, stupid,

37:33.860 --> 37:36.863
dangerous idea
worked like magic.

37:36.906 --> 37:38.081
You saved my sorry ass.

37:38.125 --> 37:41.302
Mm-mm, you saved your sorry ass.
Not me.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.782
And it was weird because
it didn't really seem like

37:42.825 --> 37:44.305
an Isaac idea at all.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.655
You're usually so doctor-y
and conservative,

37:46.699 --> 37:48.178
and all of a sudden,
you're this balls out,

you can't do this.

40:50.535 --> 40:51.536
Yeah.

40:58.499 --> 41:00.501
So that's it?

41:00.545 --> 41:01.981
We're done?

41:04.374 --> 41:05.463
We're done.

LEON: Julia.

41:36.232 --> 41:37.451
Orange soda.

41:37.495 --> 41:41.455
It used to make everything
feel better.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.891
When I was 11.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.156
Worth a shot.

41:50.551 --> 41:53.946
I-I had no idea
things would take such a turn.

41:53.989 --> 41:57.210
I mean, it's amazing how cruel
people can be on the Internet.

41:57.253 --> 41:59.517
And you know, I never thought

41:59.560 --> 42:02.258
that you would have to pay
such a public price.

42:04.347 --> 42:07.176
And I'm s...

42:09.439 --> 42:11.267
Here?

42:11.311 --> 42:12.921
Well,
I guess that's as close

42:12.965 --> 42:14.488
to an apology as I'm gonna get.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.578
Julia, can I--can I come--

42:19.624 --> 42:21.539
I don't think we're there yet.

42:23.236 --> 42:26.108
Sorry.
Good night, Dad.

I think we found
your new key witness--

waiting in your office.

42:49.305 --> 42:50.655
Really?

42:50.698 --> 42:52.700
Maybe we won't need
that continuance after all.

42:59.402 --> 43:00.665
Mr. and Mrs. Doyle.

43:00.708 --> 43:03.058
Nice to meet you.
