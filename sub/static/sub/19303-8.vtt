00:32.367 --> 00:34.244
Where are you right now?

00:38.123 --> 00:40.417
<i>Your head's off somewhere.</i>

00:40.583 --> 00:42.001
David.

00:43.878 --> 00:46.089
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

01:06.151 --> 01:07.527
Where are you right now?

01:18.872 --> 01:20.540
Hi.

01:20.790 --> 01:23.501
Hi.Hi.

01:24.878 --> 01:30.133
Don't talk.
Don't talk. It's okay. We're here.

01:32.677 --> 01:39.350
You've had a good burn,
but we're gonna get you sorted out.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.771
Okay.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.774
- Careful, careful, careful.
- No, it's good.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.527
It's good.

01:50.445 --> 01:52.530
It's good.

01:56.743 --> 02:00.121
I'm thinking of growing
half a mustache.

02:00.455 --> 02:02.999
Maybe half a beard.

02:03.166 --> 02:08.421
Or what's the look where it's
just a beard and no mustache?

02:08.588 --> 02:10.590
Darling, hush.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.884
So half of that.

02:21.434 --> 02:23.436
There's my handsome guy.

02:26.523 --> 02:27.690
Mirror.

02:27.857 --> 02:32.654
- Maybe wait until the swelling goes down--
- Give me the goddamn mirror.

03:09.732 --> 03:14.404
<i>If you will give us some time,
I'm sure we can come to some arrangement.</i>

03:14.571 --> 03:18.366
<i>We as a village are only asking....</i>

04:36.444 --> 04:37.987
<i>Who are you people?</i>

04:38.154 --> 04:39.405
I ask the questions.

04:41.908 --> 04:45.662
The girl. Where is the girl?

04:48.247 --> 04:49.874
I think you're about to find out.

05:02.971 --> 05:06.224
Bureau 19 has recommended desk duty.

05:07.684 --> 05:08.726
Perfect.

05:10.061 --> 05:14.607
Except, you know, in the field.

05:14.774 --> 05:15.817
What?

05:15.984 --> 05:17.026
I said, that's great.

05:17.193 --> 05:20.446
Desk duty. Perfect. I'll bring
the desk with me, was my feeling.

05:20.613 --> 05:22.782
A small desk, obviously.
Maybe it folds up.

05:22.949 --> 05:26.244
That way I'll have it while I'm making
the world safe for democracy.

05:26.411 --> 05:29.455
- Specialists don't--
- Yeah, okay. Here's the deal.

05:29.789 --> 05:31.624
I have burns over
40 percent of my body...

05:31.791 --> 05:34.794
...and I spent six weeks
with a tube jammed into my dick...

05:34.961 --> 05:37.755
...while my husband cried himself
to sleep every night.

05:37.922 --> 05:42.677
We were ambushed.
At the pool. Men died.

05:42.844 --> 05:45.555
And I am going to finish what I started.

05:45.722 --> 05:49.392
So if you want me behind a desk,
you better find a portable one, because...

05:49.559 --> 05:54.188
...the second I walk out of this room,
I'm going to war.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.449
David, hello.

06:48.159 --> 06:52.288
You look well. Love the headband.

06:52.538 --> 06:58.711
I know, me, not so good.
Third degree, thank you very much.

06:59.087 --> 07:00.630
Very painful.

07:03.382 --> 07:06.677
Oh, we have so much to talk about.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.973
Yeah, you can kill the others.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.183
No.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.665
Put it away.

07:41.462 --> 07:45.007
You're right. We need to talk.

07:49.846 --> 07:51.597
Shit.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.070
Team A's been compromised. Team B?

08:06.237 --> 08:08.281
Ready at the go point.

08:08.447 --> 08:10.116
Wait.

08:10.950 --> 08:13.286
Personal feelings?

08:14.036 --> 08:18.541
Intelligence gathering.
Let's see what happens next.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.421
So you're just gonna whip up
some kind of peace accord...

08:23.588 --> 08:26.215
...what, before lunch or by dinner?

08:27.091 --> 08:28.467
Babe...

08:28.634 --> 08:31.512
...I don't care if you save me...

08:31.679 --> 08:33.723
...or the world...

08:33.890 --> 08:36.642
...if you don't save yourself.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.440
You know the most dangerous thing
about schizophrenia?

08:42.607 --> 08:46.068
- You're not--
- The most dangerous thing is believing...

08:46.235 --> 08:48.404
...you don't have it.

08:48.571 --> 08:52.408
That's the trick. The mind killer.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.703
Your disease convinces you
you don't have it.

08:55.870 --> 08:59.540
So, for example, one day
in the hospital, you meet a girl...

08:59.707 --> 09:04.795
<i>...and she has some friends,
and they tell you you're not sick.</i>

09:04.962 --> 09:07.548
You have superpowers.
And you want to believe it.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.384
Because that means you're not crazy.

09:10.551 --> 09:15.223
That means you can fall in love
and live happily ever after.

09:16.224 --> 09:20.811
But you know if you believe it, if you
surrender to the hope and you're wrong...

09:22.730 --> 09:24.398
...then you're never coming back.

09:26.234 --> 09:28.152
<i>I'm here.</i>

09:28.319 --> 09:30.238
<i>I'm real.</i>

09:31.614 --> 09:33.908
<i>The power is real.</i>

09:34.617 --> 09:38.329
You gotta accept it.
Otherwise, we can't move on.

09:44.210 --> 09:47.129
<i>I was in Clockworks for six years...</i>

09:47.296 --> 09:50.258
<i>... drugged, doing nothing,
contributing nothing.</i>

09:50.424 --> 09:54.178
And now, finally,
I can be useful, I can help.

09:54.804 --> 09:58.391
Don't you get it? I am so sick of myself.

09:58.683 --> 10:01.227
This only works if it's not about me.

10:01.394 --> 10:03.354
David.

10:31.716 --> 10:34.010
<i>Delta 10-9, copy.</i>

10:34.176 --> 10:36.804
<i>Be advised, we are monitoring situation.</i>

10:36.971 --> 10:39.348
<i>We have secure audio and visual.</i>

10:39.515 --> 10:42.601
<i>Five-by-five on all signals
from your position.</i>

10:42.768 --> 10:46.439
<i>Maintain current posture.
Tactical is in place.</i>

10:46.605 --> 10:49.525
<i>We can initiate assault and extraction
on command.</i>

10:49.984 --> 10:51.527
<i>Awaiting your signal.</i>

10:51.694 --> 10:53.321
<i>Acknowledge.</i>

10:56.282 --> 10:59.160
Come on, just let me,
face to face. Please.

10:59.327 --> 11:00.995
No.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.456
Well, if you've got a better idea.

11:03.622 --> 11:07.960
- Yeah, kill them. Kill them all.
- Grow up.

11:08.252 --> 11:11.088
We can't just murder people.

11:11.589 --> 11:12.840
Or is that who we are now?

11:13.007 --> 11:14.967
That's who they are,
so if you don't want to be dead--

11:15.134 --> 11:17.970
- Do you have to?
- Yes, I absolutely have to.

11:18.137 --> 11:21.015
If this thing fails, well...

11:21.349 --> 11:24.101
...you didn't see Walter's blood
pouring out of his eyes.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.979
All right, we move, then.
Assume D3 knows our position.

11:27.772 --> 11:28.898
Execute plan M.

11:29.065 --> 11:32.318
Just let me talk to him.
We have a rapport.

11:32.485 --> 11:34.945
He tried to kill you. Twice.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.156
The second time
he was just gonna kill you.

11:37.323 --> 11:38.574
- With that kind of thinking--
- David.

11:38.741 --> 11:41.786
No, with that kind of thinking,
wars would never end.

11:41.952 --> 11:46.916
David, read his mind.
You have the power, you can control it now.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.543
We may never get this chance again.

11:49.710 --> 11:55.549
To know what D3 knows.
Their operations, their spies, their tactics.

11:57.426 --> 11:58.511
Read his mind.

12:00.346 --> 12:04.100
So use him, you're saying.
And then what? Kill him?

12:04.266 --> 12:05.559
A hundred percent.

12:05.726 --> 12:11.524
Hi, look, whatever we do, we need to get
this parasite out of David's head and fast.

12:11.690 --> 12:14.902
- The halo is losing power.
<i>- Hey, kid.</i>

12:15.069 --> 12:16.278
And when it fails?

12:16.529 --> 12:19.824
Think of the Shadow King
as a computer virus.

12:19.990 --> 12:23.369
It's been in David's head
for decades, learning his systems...

12:23.536 --> 12:28.207
...bypassing his defenses.
Now it's ready to...

12:28.374 --> 12:30.751
...override the original program.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.837
Meaning me.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.922
Exactly, meaning you.

12:35.089 --> 12:40.010
If we don't get Amahl Farouk
out of your head, today, he will erase you.

12:41.095 --> 12:42.471
Permanently.

12:42.638 --> 12:45.599
<i>It's sweet, really.
They think they can save you.</i>

13:15.713 --> 13:17.965
I thought you might be thirsty.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.193
On the table.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.338
- Do you have a second to--?
- Don't talk to me.

13:57.505 --> 14:03.761
Right, sorry. Just, you should--
We should recharge.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.555
I'm good.

14:07.598 --> 14:10.059
- You two have a fight?
- Shut up.

14:14.104 --> 14:18.317
She just-- We.... She thinks I left her
when we were in the astral plane, and I...

14:18.484 --> 14:22.947
- ...have tried to explain that it wasn't my--
- You need to leave.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.630
He seems nice.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.970
<i>Have I seen you before?</i>

14:46.637 --> 14:48.973
<i>No, don't tell me. I'll remember.</i>

14:49.139 --> 14:52.393
Oliver, could we talk?

14:59.149 --> 15:01.569
What's happening, space captain?

15:03.696 --> 15:06.657
<i>Would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?</i>

15:07.575 --> 15:09.243
<i>Well, uh...</i>

15:09.410 --> 15:12.162
...I'm on a mostly, uh, liquid diet.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.123
I like liquid.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.332
Mm.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.377
You know, uh...

15:18.544 --> 15:21.338
...you remind me of someone.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.426
Your wife?

15:28.721 --> 15:30.389
No, that's not it.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.976
Huh. More....

15:34.143 --> 15:35.853
No.

15:36.020 --> 15:37.271
Ah.

15:38.981 --> 15:42.359
Well, we can figure it out over dinner.

15:43.319 --> 15:44.320
Hm.

15:44.486 --> 15:48.449
- Assuming we're not all dead by then.
- Watch it, it's vibrating.

15:48.616 --> 15:51.160
Oliver, there's vibration.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.245
Ah, whoops, uh....

15:54.163 --> 15:56.790
That's me. I should....

15:56.957 --> 15:58.083
Ta for now.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.157
I'm sorry.

16:30.324 --> 16:33.369
Well, if you're not now, you will be.

16:35.746 --> 16:37.581
Can we move past the threats?

16:37.748 --> 16:41.919
I don't think you understand.
There's 50 of you.

16:42.086 --> 16:44.630
We're a tactical arm
of the United States military...

16:44.797 --> 16:48.175
...working in conjunction with
government agencies all over the world.

16:48.342 --> 16:52.179
And dinosaurs once ruled the Earth.
Remind me what happened to them?

16:52.346 --> 16:56.225
Are you threatening the entire human race?
Do I have that right?

17:00.437 --> 17:01.939
<i>What's your name, son?</i>

17:02.898 --> 17:03.982
Clark.

17:04.149 --> 17:07.444
Well, Clark, I'm Melanie.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.988
I know. Melanie Bird.

17:10.155 --> 17:15.869
Wife of Oliver Anthony Bird.
Missing for 20 years and presumed dead.

17:17.705 --> 17:19.957
Oh, he'll turn up.

17:22.876 --> 17:27.005
They know where I am. Division 3.
They'll come looking when we don't check in.

17:27.172 --> 17:33.262
I'm thinking, 20 minutes,
and when they do, they'll bring an army.

17:37.141 --> 17:39.893
Here's the thing, Clark. Ahem.

17:41.103 --> 17:44.940
You caught me on a good day,
so I'm gonna be honest with you.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.484
You were right.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.528
About David.

17:50.195 --> 17:52.948
He's a world-breaker.

17:53.115 --> 17:56.034
And if you'd killed him
before he figured that out...

17:56.201 --> 18:02.958
...then maybe your tactical forces
and, what is it? World coalition?

18:03.125 --> 18:05.461
Maybe that would've impressed me.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.504
But not now.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.717
Well, kid...

18:12.426 --> 18:17.473
...you better learn to fly like a bird,
because the age of the dinosaur is over.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.276
<i>- The simulation?
- Are you real?</i>

18:29.443 --> 18:30.486
<i>No, this is real.</i>

18:30.652 --> 18:32.696
<i>- What's the point of life?
- I don't have...</i>

18:32.863 --> 18:34.531
<i>- ...an illness.
- That's the old narrative.</i>

18:34.698 --> 18:36.033
<i>- Trying to what?
- I'm sick.</i>

18:36.200 --> 18:37.576
<i>- Be happy?
- You're not...</i>

18:37.743 --> 18:40.204
<i>- Fulfilled?
- ...schizophrenic.</i>

18:57.554 --> 18:58.931
War is over.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.768
If you want it.

19:22.704 --> 19:25.290
I'm boosting the power,
but it won't last long.

19:25.457 --> 19:26.959
You don't look so good.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.293
I'm fine.

19:28.752 --> 19:31.463
No, something's going on here.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.886
Well, this has been great.
But I think I hear my ride.

19:38.053 --> 19:40.097
Does anybody see a Warbird helicopter?

19:40.264 --> 19:41.640
You don't have to be afraid.

19:43.809 --> 19:47.437
- I'm not.
- You don't have to be afraid.

19:50.023 --> 19:53.110
You don't have to be afraid.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.612
I'm not.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.322
You...

19:57.698 --> 19:59.116
...don't...

19:59.408 --> 20:00.784
...have...

20:01.326 --> 20:02.995
...to...

20:03.161 --> 20:05.122
...be...

20:05.873 --> 20:06.957
...afraid.

20:07.207 --> 20:10.377
- Stop saying that.
- Why don't you just leave us alone?

20:10.544 --> 20:11.587
To do what?

20:11.753 --> 20:13.380
I don't know.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.924
Fall in love, have babies.

20:16.091 --> 20:18.677
That's a problem.
Because your babies and my babies...

20:18.844 --> 20:21.179
...who wins that sandbox squabble?

20:21.346 --> 20:24.099
- You don't have to be--
- I know. Don't have to be afraid.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.434
But I am.

20:25.601 --> 20:27.936
Because look at you.
All of you. You're gods.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.646
And someday, you're gonna wake up...

20:29.813 --> 20:33.066
...and realize you don't
need to listen to us anymore.

20:34.318 --> 20:37.321
Well, isn't that the history of the world?

20:37.487 --> 20:42.951
People of different nations, different
languages, learning to live together.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.921
David?

21:00.177 --> 21:02.054
Hey, sexy.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.767
You can't be here.

21:07.184 --> 21:08.435
Why not?

21:08.602 --> 21:10.646
Because David put a hat on?

21:12.522 --> 21:15.651
Look, front door closes, I go in the back.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.028
You like that, don't you?

21:20.864 --> 21:23.951
A little backdoor action.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.997
You're gonna help me.

21:29.373 --> 21:30.540
No.

21:34.378 --> 21:36.046
I'm really not.

21:36.213 --> 21:38.382
We're connected, kid.

21:38.548 --> 21:42.302
You, David, me.

21:43.095 --> 21:44.554
It's your fault.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.141
When you were in his head,
I was in yours.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.603
And I may not be on his frequency
right now...

21:51.770 --> 21:54.106
...but you can hear me
just fine, can't you?

21:54.272 --> 21:55.941
<i>Stop.</i>

21:58.193 --> 22:01.321
My mother died a few years back.

22:01.863 --> 22:03.740
Cancer.

22:03.991 --> 22:05.826
She tried all the things.

22:06.660 --> 22:10.372
Chemo, radiation, surgery.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.876
You know what they do with a tumor
when they cut it out?

22:18.505 --> 22:20.799
They put it in a bag...

22:20.966 --> 22:22.801
...and burn it.

22:23.927 --> 22:28.682
- Am I the tumor in this--?
- Your Lenny mask is running.

22:29.933 --> 22:32.060
Oh, I've got other faces.

22:33.603 --> 22:35.272
Stop it.

22:35.439 --> 22:37.566
You're gonna help me escape.

22:37.858 --> 22:41.653
You want me out of David?
Fine, I'm gone.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.781
- But you have to help me get away.
- Why would I do that?

22:45.365 --> 22:48.452
Because if you don't, I'll kill him.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.786
Not if we kill you first.

22:49.953 --> 22:52.080
You ever make soup?

22:52.539 --> 22:58.795
Cut up the meat, vegetables, add broth.
Cook it for a couple hours.

23:00.756 --> 23:03.008
You ever try to unmake soup?

23:05.594 --> 23:07.554
I'm part of him.

23:07.721 --> 23:11.099
And the only way
you're gonna get me out without killing him...

23:11.266 --> 23:13.977
...is if I decide to leave on my own.

23:17.147 --> 23:19.024
There it is.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.320
Now you see.

23:27.866 --> 23:28.867
How would I--?

23:29.034 --> 23:30.619
You're smart...

23:31.745 --> 23:33.663
...little lady.

23:34.915 --> 23:36.416
You'll figure it out.

23:39.127 --> 23:42.255
Even if I wanted to,
I'm not even in the top three tiers of....

23:42.422 --> 23:45.383
We're talking about
three branches of government.

23:45.550 --> 23:48.220
I just need a meeting. Face to face.

23:48.804 --> 23:52.182
- Why? So you can melt their heads?
- All right, this meeting's over.

23:52.349 --> 23:58.271
No. I need a meeting
so that I can change their minds....

23:59.523 --> 24:03.276
- We need to get him to the lab.
- What's--? What's going on? Is he sick?

24:03.443 --> 24:05.320
Nothing. Ptonomy, get him to holding.

24:07.489 --> 24:11.493
He's not sick. He has some
kind of creature in his head.

24:11.660 --> 24:14.579
- A mutant, very old.
- Syd.

24:14.746 --> 24:16.289
No.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.793
<i>David's right.</i>

24:21.586 --> 24:23.380
Trust.

24:24.339 --> 24:29.094
This thing attached itself to him
when he was a kid, like a parasite.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.681
It's trying to erase him.

24:34.432 --> 24:36.685
But we're gonna get it out.

24:37.060 --> 24:39.771
Maybe I'm wrong,
but I think you like David.

24:40.522 --> 24:43.275
I think you feel something for him.

24:45.610 --> 24:48.613
So I'm gonna give you a chance here.
You wanna help?

24:53.160 --> 24:55.370
That's nice. Take him to the cell.

24:55.579 --> 24:57.164
Let's go.

24:59.791 --> 25:02.335
I can't risk it.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.255
It's okay.

25:05.422 --> 25:06.923
I got you.

25:51.843 --> 25:53.970
Try anything and I snap your neck.

25:54.137 --> 25:56.306
What happened to trust?

25:56.473 --> 25:59.559
General, Major Briggs wants permission
to launch the Peacemaker.

25:59.726 --> 26:03.438
No. Tell him to move
one klick closer then hold.

26:03.605 --> 26:06.107
I'm giving your man another hour.

26:20.497 --> 26:22.249
- What happened?
- Does it matter?

26:22.415 --> 26:25.585
- We'll probably all be dead in 10 minutes.
- Why am I tied down?

26:26.294 --> 26:27.462
You tell me.

26:28.505 --> 26:31.424
I can feel him inside
trying to force his way out.

26:31.716 --> 26:34.970
Use your power. You just have
to hold on for a little while longer.

26:35.804 --> 26:36.846
And then what?

26:38.723 --> 26:40.058
Then...

26:40.225 --> 26:41.810
...when we pull...

26:41.977 --> 26:43.853
...you push.

26:51.278 --> 26:53.280
Then boom goes the dynamite.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.246
I'll be you-know-where.

27:21.224 --> 27:23.184
Okay, here we go.

27:23.351 --> 27:26.187
Wait, how does it work?

27:28.315 --> 27:32.777
We've identified a second set
of brainwaves inside David's head.

27:33.403 --> 27:36.448
<i>Now, this device targets everything
that isn't David.</i>

27:36.614 --> 27:38.992
<i>It creates a vortex,
a kind of a magnetic field...</i>

27:39.159 --> 27:43.038
...which sucks out, hopefully,
every last trace of Farouk...

27:43.455 --> 27:45.540
...and leaves David intact.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.177
How will I know when--?

28:22.410 --> 28:26.581
<i>Breathe, breathe in the air</i>

28:30.418 --> 28:33.963
<i>Don't be afraid to care</i>

28:37.384 --> 28:41.346
<i>Leave but don't leave me</i>

28:44.224 --> 28:48.353
<i>Look around, choose your own ground</i>

28:48.520 --> 28:49.729
<i>What do you think, Oliver?</i>

28:49.896 --> 28:52.649
Generator is at 69 percent and rising.

28:52.816 --> 28:54.984
<i>Give me 20 percent more.</i>

28:55.151 --> 28:58.530
<i>And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry</i>

28:59.114 --> 29:02.200
<i>And all you touch and all you see</i>

29:02.826 --> 29:05.995
<i>Is all your life will ever be</i>

29:36.734 --> 29:37.902
It's working.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.530
- See?
- Yeah.

29:41.489 --> 29:42.699
It's working.

29:46.369 --> 29:49.330
<i>The only way you're gonna get me out...</i>

29:49.706 --> 29:54.335
<i>... without killing him,
is if I decide to leave on my own.</i>

30:10.435 --> 30:14.397
Hold on. It's fighting back.

31:10.954 --> 31:12.455
No.

31:20.672 --> 31:22.632
Lenny.

31:31.182 --> 31:33.560
I was just wondering...

31:37.689 --> 31:40.066
...what am I without you?

31:42.026 --> 31:45.154
You know, we've been together
for so long.

31:50.660 --> 31:52.787
Sun and moon.

31:55.415 --> 31:57.917
People lose a limb...

31:59.210 --> 32:03.339
...and in the night, years go by,
and still they reach for it.

32:06.634 --> 32:09.304
The phantom.

32:12.890 --> 32:14.684
Are you my phantom?

32:17.687 --> 32:20.690
What happens to me when you're gone?

32:26.863 --> 32:28.865
I'm...

32:29.198 --> 32:30.950
...not...

32:31.868 --> 32:33.411
...leaving.

32:45.548 --> 32:47.133
No.

32:47.592 --> 32:49.802
Stop it, we have to.

32:54.807 --> 32:56.559
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

32:56.726 --> 32:58.186
Syd.

32:58.353 --> 33:01.064
- Get out of my way.
<i>- Malfunction detected.</i>

33:02.940 --> 33:04.400
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

33:05.401 --> 33:07.111
Oliver, I need more power.

33:07.278 --> 33:08.613
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

33:11.199 --> 33:12.408
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

33:20.458 --> 33:22.251
Stay here.

33:25.505 --> 33:28.633
Uh, you see that, right?

33:31.552 --> 33:34.180
Send the Equinox.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.566
<i>Oliver, now.</i>

34:07.797 --> 34:09.132
David.

34:10.466 --> 34:12.427
Holdon!

36:26.310 --> 36:28.354
Click, click.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.068
Bang.

36:46.497 --> 36:51.878
<i>Malfunction detected. Malfunction detected.</i>

36:52.044 --> 36:53.546
Oh, God. Shut up.

36:53.713 --> 36:55.423
<i>Malfunction....</i>

38:00.363 --> 38:02.031
Wait.

38:05.534 --> 38:07.203
Melanie.

39:09.015 --> 39:11.684
Electric grid, I think.
Mismatched wires and all that.

39:11.851 --> 39:14.729
You might want to form a bucket chain.

39:15.396 --> 39:17.189
<i>If I ruled the world</i>

39:18.232 --> 39:21.819
<i>Every day would be the first day of spring</i>

39:22.570 --> 39:26.615
<i>Every heart would have a new song to sing</i>

39:27.033 --> 39:32.329
<i>And we'd sing of the joy
Every morning would bring</i>

39:33.873 --> 39:36.083
<i>If I ruled the world</i>

39:38.210 --> 39:40.880
<i>If I ruled the world</i>

40:11.160 --> 40:13.996
Hey. It's okay, you're okay.

40:14.747 --> 40:16.540
He's gone.

40:22.505 --> 40:24.131
Here.

40:27.718 --> 40:29.720
Remember how you told me
not to be afraid?

40:29.887 --> 40:32.223
All right, that was a mistake.

40:33.224 --> 40:36.477
We're gonna need
to work together now, though.

40:36.644 --> 40:40.231
I know. I'll talk to them.

41:34.952 --> 41:36.662
Ms. Bird.

41:37.246 --> 41:38.956
Ms. Bird.

41:41.083 --> 41:44.962
- Is it...?
- Yeah, it's gone.

41:47.423 --> 41:48.966
Hey.

41:50.050 --> 41:56.432
- Are you okay?
- I'm-- I think you ruptured my spleen.

42:03.355 --> 42:05.024
Hi.

42:05.191 --> 42:06.734
Hey.

42:07.193 --> 42:09.028
Did we win?

42:09.737 --> 42:12.114
Does it look like we won?

42:12.615 --> 42:18.287
You should not have done that,
as much as I like kissing you.

42:18.454 --> 42:20.623
It would have killed you.

42:21.999 --> 42:24.001
How do you feel?

42:26.086 --> 42:27.755
Better.

42:28.964 --> 42:35.221
I don't understand. It needs a host,
the Shadow King. So if it's not in one of us....

42:35.804 --> 42:37.348
Where's Oliver?

43:02.289 --> 43:04.792
Where should we look first?

43:05.751 --> 43:08.295
Someplace warm.

43:19.223 --> 43:20.266
<i>Yeah!</i>

43:26.230 --> 43:28.941
<i>Well, you can bump and grind</i>

43:30.192 --> 43:32.778
<i>It is good for your mind</i>

43:33.570 --> 43:36.198
<i>Well, you can twist and shout</i>

43:37.366 --> 43:39.076
<i>Let it all hang out</i>

43:39.243 --> 43:44.331
<i>But you won't fool
The children of the revolution</i>

43:44.498 --> 43:49.670
<i>No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution</i>

43:49.837 --> 43:51.797
<i>No, no, no</i>

43:57.428 --> 44:00.097
<i>Well, you can tear a plane</i>

44:01.140 --> 44:03.851
<i>In the falling rain</i>

44:04.768 --> 44:07.438
<i>I drive a Rolls Royce</i>

44:08.564 --> 44:10.316
<i>'Cause it's good for my voice</i>

44:10.482 --> 44:15.487
<i>But you won't fool
The children of the revolution</i>

44:15.654 --> 44:20.909
<i>No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution</i>

44:21.076 --> 44:23.120
<i>No, no, no</i>

44:24.997 --> 44:26.582
<i>Yeah!</i>

44:52.900 --> 44:57.988
<i>But you won't fool
The children of the revolution</i>

44:58.155 --> 45:03.994
<i>No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution</i>

45:04.161 --> 45:05.579
<i>No way</i>

45:07.831 --> 45:08.832
<i>Hey</i>

45:16.006 --> 45:18.258
<i>Wow!</i>

45:24.556 --> 45:25.891
South.

45:26.475 --> 45:28.352
They're headed south.

45:37.319 --> 45:39.613
What is that? Is that one of Cary's?

45:40.739 --> 45:42.699
I think it likes you.

45:46.829 --> 45:50.332
- Oh, what the--?
- No!

45:50.541 --> 45:52.376
Help!

45:53.544 --> 45:55.754
Hey, Syd!

45:57.131 --> 45:58.382
Syd!

45:58.966 --> 46:00.634
Help me!

46:03.595 --> 46:05.722
Help me!

46:06.932 --> 46:08.308
Syd!
