WEBVTT

00:25.275 --> 00:27.194
Dance your cares away

00:27.277 --> 00:29.363
Worry's for another day

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
Let the music play

00:31.532 --> 00:33.367
Down at Fraggle Rock

00:33.450 --> 00:35.661
Work your cares away

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
Dancing's for another day

00:37.788 --> 00:39.331
Let the Fraggles play

00:39.414 --> 00:40.374
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.291
-Wembley.
-Boober.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.376
Red.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
Junior!

00:47.256 --> 00:48.590
Hello!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.301
My radish.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.388
Dance your cares away

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Worry's for another day

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
Let the music play

00:58.684 --> 01:02.604
Down at Fraggle Rock
Down at Fraggle Rock

01:02.688 --> 01:04.105
Down at Fraggle Rock.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.330
These Doozer sticks are gross.
I don't think I can eat 'em.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.416
No one can.

01:22.499 --> 01:26.461
That's why the whole hall
is full of Doozer buildings.

01:26.545 --> 01:29.673
I must have stubbed my toe
eight times to--

01:31.175 --> 01:32.843
Make that nine.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.262
And not to signal boost negativity,

01:35.345 --> 01:38.557
but our waterfall
has become a water trickle.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.936
There are so many problems
stacking up in Fraggle Rock.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.354
If only we had some help.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.318
The Wise Council is here.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.278
Come on, Henchy.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.030
Give it some pizzazz.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.535
The Wise Council is here!

01:58.619 --> 01:59.995
Wow.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.206
Now, about this waterfall problem…

02:03.248 --> 02:04.708
Icy, do your thing.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.336
It's Icy Joe time.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.088
Work!

02:11.924 --> 02:13.217
Nah. Didn't work.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.220
Well, sorry.
The best minds couldn't crack it.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.888
Anyone else hungry?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.723
I could eat.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.019
Just not that.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.354
-No.
-All right. Let's go.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.523
Wait, wait. Please don't go.

02:27.606 --> 02:30.776
Between the waterfall
and the Craggles forced out of their home,

02:30.859 --> 02:33.820
and the Doozer's yuck-tasting buildings
taking up the Great Hall,

02:33.904 --> 02:35.113
we need really your help.

02:35.197 --> 02:40.035
And not to question your processes,
but maybe it would be helpful to get

02:40.118 --> 02:42.120
a fresh mind on the council.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.997
Good idea! When can they start?

02:44.081 --> 02:45.999
Wait a second.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.710
Do you think just anyone
can join the Wise Council?

02:48.794 --> 02:49.920
Well, no.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.798
No, really. I'm asking.
How does it work? I forget.

02:53.841 --> 02:57.261
We know Wise Council material
when we see it.

02:57.344 --> 03:02.975
And when we do, we will play
the ceremonial choosing sound.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.686
All right, gang.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.856
It's time for a well-deserved nap.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.900
-It's been an afternoon, huh?
-Yeah.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.277
Wow.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.862
-Did you hear that?
-Wow.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.948
One of us could be
a member of the Wise Council.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.075
There you are.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.494
I got lost in all the Doozer buildings.

03:22.578 --> 03:25.706
I thought I saw you,
but that ended up being rocks.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.041
Wembley, we're so glad you're here.

03:28.125 --> 03:31.545
Yeah, yeah.
One of us could be on the Wise Council.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.339
Who of the four of us
should be on the Wise Council?

03:34.423 --> 03:36.800
-Yeah, which one?
-I could do it.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.218
I've got the energy.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.638
Or they could use an explorer.

03:42.598 --> 03:46.894
Or someone to stay calm
and meditate on solutions.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.354
I have foresight.

03:49.438 --> 03:52.566
I can imagine all the ways
we can get hurt.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.484
Wembley, which one?

03:57.154 --> 04:00.365
Maybe-- I mean--
I think any of you would be top-notch.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.492
But, well, I don't know. Maybe I could--

04:02.576 --> 04:04.912
-He'll never decide between us.
-No. No.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.414
Let's go try to
get the Wise Council's attention.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.750
Come on. Yeah. Excuse me, Wise Council.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.419
"Meditator in Chief." That sounds good.

04:14.296 --> 04:17.591
They didn't even consider
that I could be on the council.

04:19.676 --> 04:23.805
That's very hurtful, huh?

04:23.889 --> 04:25.057
Yeah.

04:25.641 --> 04:28.560
Look at that metropolitan majesty.

04:28.644 --> 04:32.189
Yeah. And there's a lot of buildings too.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.233
But how could we build more?

04:34.316 --> 04:36.109
We're running out of room.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.903
Relax, Cotterpin.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.781
The Fraggles will eat 'em
just like they always do.

04:40.864 --> 04:44.826
But that's the problem.
The Fraggles aren't eating them.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.496
Not since we started using that goo.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.874
I think we rushed it.
We need to take a minute and--

04:50.958 --> 04:55.254
A minute? Do you mean, like, a pause?

04:56.588 --> 05:00.008
Need I remind you, Cotterpin,
of the Great Pause?

05:00.884 --> 05:04.680
Long ago, on a Doozer day
very much like this one,

05:04.763 --> 05:08.976
a Doozer's malfitting helmet
fell into the machinery.

05:11.520 --> 05:16.358
Oh, no! My malfitting helmet
fell into the machinery.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.819
We have to pause work.

05:28.579 --> 05:32.291
-I heard it was only 40 seconds.
-It was a full minute!

05:32.374 --> 05:35.502
Listen, the goo is great.
It's a new flavor.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.964
The Fraggles just need to be convinced
to start eating it.

05:39.047 --> 05:42.926
And there's only one Doozer
convincing enough for the job.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.512
You don't mean--

05:45.596 --> 05:46.847
Jack Hammer?

05:46.930 --> 05:49.892
The legend himself.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.352
He came up with the nine-day workweek.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.147
Tool belt Tuesday.

05:56.899 --> 06:01.653
Why, he's the one who got the monorail
down to only one rail.

06:05.908 --> 06:08.368
That's Jack Hammer.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.677
Okay, Doozers. Let's "dooze" this.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.730
Having fun, buddy?

06:38.398 --> 06:41.026
Don't get the wrong idea. I can't play.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.319
I've got the lunch shift.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.863
But I've got the perfect
friend to play fetch with you.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.449
Voilà.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.954
I call it Doc Bot.

06:52.037 --> 06:55.541
While I'm at work, it'll walk you,
feed you, play with you,

06:55.624 --> 06:59.419
take care of you,
take over the world with its robot pals.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.047
Just kidding about that last one.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.424
Hopefully. Look at this.

07:05.634 --> 07:06.885
It plays fetch.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.475
Doc Bot.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.935
Cookie boy.

07:15.018 --> 07:18.021
Who is good, very dog, boy?

07:18.105 --> 07:19.273
You are.

07:21.859 --> 07:25.320
Are you, boy? Dog, very good.

07:25.404 --> 07:28.407
Boy, cookie. Cookie boy.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.993
-Who is good--
-It'll be like I never left.

07:31.076 --> 07:35.247
I can go to work and grow my bacteria,
and Doc Bot will look after you.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.792
You two have fun.
I have to go walk the shake plank.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.759
There, there, Spork-let.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.721
There, there.

07:52.681 --> 07:57.394
Okay. So, if one of us is going to
get on the Wise Council,

07:57.477 --> 08:01.190
we're gonna to have to figure out
a way to really get their attention.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.274
Yeah.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.568
My Uncle Travelling Matt
would know what to do.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.154
In fact, he just sent me
a postcard about it.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.740
Oh, no. Not another one.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.575
Awesome, right? Another one.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.118
"Dear Nephew Gobo…"

08:13.202 --> 08:17.706
I must admit, it does get lonely
out here in Outer Space.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.291
Hello.

08:19.374 --> 08:24.505
I, too, like putting a small item
into a large-item carrier.

08:24.588 --> 08:28.800
Though the Silly Creatures clearly
respect me, they kept their distance.

08:28.884 --> 08:33.347
Perhaps they were intimidated by me.
I needed a way to break through.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.602
And then I saw him.

08:38.684 --> 08:42.981
A Silly Creature trapped in a tiny box
telling me exactly what to do.

08:43.065 --> 08:46.026
Things up top getting you down?

08:46.109 --> 08:50.322
Well, now there's a solution.
Spray-on hair in a can.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.580
I got my hair and my confidence back,

08:58.664 --> 09:00.541
and so much more.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.501
Wow.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.089
Wow.

09:09.383 --> 09:14.304
That's it. I need top fuzzy.
Now, where do I find it?

09:14.388 --> 09:18.225
Spray-on hair in a can,
available literally right here.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.897
Oh, yes. Friends in a can.

09:31.947 --> 09:35.117
And just like that, all eyes were on me.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.874
And look!
He even sent us the can of friends.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.710
Let me see that.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.253
Do me. Do me. Do me.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.886
So, you think I'll get
more attention this way?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.597
Say, "Dear Nephew Gobo."

09:57.264 --> 09:59.308
Dear Nephew Gobo.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.354
If anyone's gonna
get the attention of the Wise Council,

10:04.438 --> 10:08.192
-it's one of the four of us here.
-Yeah, that's right. Come on.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.111
Dear Nephew Gobo.
I sound like him, don't I?

10:11.195 --> 10:13.030
-Do it again.
-I sound like him.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.452
My friends don't think I can
be on the Wise Council.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.495
Well, sure, I wemble,

10:20.579 --> 10:23.665
but I can make a decision
when it's important.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.001
Yeah. Like right now.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.753
I'm gonna pick up this rock.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.173
But do I want a bigger rock?

10:31.924 --> 10:33.926
All right, troops, we need the Fraggles

10:34.009 --> 10:36.220
-to eat the new goo sticks.
-Yeah.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.931
If just one Fraggle says
they like the taste,

10:39.014 --> 10:41.475
we can build a whole
ad campaign around that.

10:41.558 --> 10:42.726
Genius.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.897
A Fraggle who's good-natured,
but not too firm in his convictions.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.609
-A Fraggle like--
-Small rock, big rock.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.611
Big rock, small rock.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.781
Big, small. Big, small.
Big, small. Big, small.

10:57.366 --> 11:02.204
Him. Doozers, that's our Fraggle.

11:02.287 --> 11:06.083
Dog cookie for good, good, good Sporcket.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.627
Sporcket. Good, good, good.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.046
Good, Spork. Good.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.172
Outside.

11:12.798 --> 11:15.717
Treat boy for Sprocket.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.804
Time play. Maximum superfetch.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.538
Hey, buddy.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.373
-Now that's a shirt.
-What?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.710
The name's Hammer. Jack Hammer. You know--

11:51.628 --> 11:54.756
All right. Good kid, what's your name?

11:54.840 --> 11:55.841
Wembley.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.802
Your voice has got strength.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.179
It does?

12:00.262 --> 12:03.807
You bet. Wembley, I'll level with you.

12:07.102 --> 12:09.730
-Wrench.
-Sorry, Mr. Hammer.

12:12.316 --> 12:15.319
We got big problems in Doozerland.

12:15.402 --> 12:19.364
And, frankly, only you can help.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.869
Wembley,
Fraggles aren't eating the buildings.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.829
It's a big problem,

12:25.913 --> 12:29.666
or was until
our spokes-Fraggle came along.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.210
Spokes-Fraggle?

12:31.293 --> 12:35.923
You get to tell the other Fraggles that
these Doozer sticks are special.

12:37.382 --> 12:40.511
Well, what makes them special?

12:41.386 --> 12:42.846
See that goo?

12:42.930 --> 12:45.766
It makes stronger sticks
and taller buildings.

12:45.849 --> 12:50.062
But we can't build without room.
And we won't have room…

12:50.145 --> 12:52.648
Unless the Fraggles eat the buildings.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.816
Correcto-spamundo.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.528
If only they knew how special it was.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.864
It would be a crying shame
if Fraggles didn't give him--

13:02.032 --> 13:04.701
I mean, it, a chance.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.913
Yeah. Yeah. It deserves a chance.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.249
Just like me on the Wise Council.

13:11.083 --> 13:15.629
But I've eaten the new sticks,
and I'm not sure I really like the taste.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.130
That was before.

13:17.214 --> 13:22.010
How about you taste them again,
as if for the very first time.

13:22.094 --> 13:23.637
Hey. Here you go.

13:32.688 --> 13:36.525
"Mmm, mmm, mmm" is right. Good!

13:38.026 --> 13:40.445
Well, I guess I like it.

13:40.529 --> 13:41.780
Perfect.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.491
Wembley, you're gonna be huge.

13:44.575 --> 13:45.576
What?

13:47.035 --> 13:49.621
You could be a great Fraggle king

13:52.916 --> 13:55.961
Who, me? No, I'm just Wembley.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.716
You could be a coward

14:00.799 --> 14:02.634
You could be a king

14:04.178 --> 14:08.223
You could be the kind of kid
Who teaches us to sing

14:09.600 --> 14:14.688
You could be
Whatever your little heart desires

14:14.771 --> 14:19.193
You could be a walking, talking
Breathing ball of fire

14:22.446 --> 14:23.697
Sometimes a mountain

14:24.531 --> 14:26.074
Sometimes a stone

14:27.075 --> 14:30.746
Sometimes a river winding round
To find a home

14:31.914 --> 14:33.332
You could crawl away

14:34.249 --> 14:35.751
You could fly higher

14:36.418 --> 14:40.214
You could be a walking, talking
Breathing ball of fire

14:41.256 --> 14:45.427
You can be walking, talking
Breathing ball of fire

14:46.845 --> 14:50.766
Why do I keep wandering
In my dreams today?

14:51.350 --> 14:55.270
Why do I keep seeming
Like so many mes?

14:55.771 --> 14:59.733
How can I be turned around
So many ways?

15:00.567 --> 15:03.820
When will I know who I want to be?

15:04.988 --> 15:06.031
Hey!

15:07.074 --> 15:09.117
You could walk in darkness

15:09.201 --> 15:11.245
You could walk in light

15:11.328 --> 15:14.957
You could learn to follow
Every dream you dream at night

15:15.040 --> 15:16.291
I could?

15:16.375 --> 15:20.712
You could be the person
That you most admire

15:20.796 --> 15:24.341
You could be a walking, talking
Breathing ball of fire

15:25.509 --> 15:28.971
I could be a walking, talking,
breathing ball of fire?

15:29.054 --> 15:30.055
Yeah.

15:30.138 --> 15:33.642
You could be a walking, talking
Breathing ball of fire

15:41.900 --> 15:46.238
All right, kid. Go say what we practiced,
and then walk away.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.322
Yeah.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.325
These taste awful.

15:51.952 --> 15:57.833
Well, only the coolest Fraggles
get it, so maybe it's just not for you.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.376
And then walk away.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.629
No, don't say "walk away."
You just walk aw-- Just walk away.

16:02.713 --> 16:04.756
Wembley! Walk away!

16:04.840 --> 16:07.634
Right. Walking away now.

16:09.178 --> 16:12.848
Hey! I'm cool.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.058
-Me too!
-Look at me getting it.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.145
Joining a crowd makes me cool! Yeah!

16:18.228 --> 16:19.855
Oh, yeah.

16:19.938 --> 16:23.192
These new Doozer sticks are here
for a limited time only.

16:23.275 --> 16:24.902
Get 'em while they last.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.112
Only for a limited time?

16:27.196 --> 16:29.823
We'd better eat them
before they're all gone.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.203
They're organic!

16:35.787 --> 16:36.997
More coming.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.210
They're very mature.

16:44.922 --> 16:47.508
They're sophisticated and complex.

16:54.264 --> 16:57.893
It's working. And now so can we.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.145
Everyone, back to work.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.106
Hooray!

17:03.190 --> 17:06.777
All right, Wembley.
Every hip product needs a catchy jingle.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.111
Let's do it.

17:08.194 --> 17:12.115
They're the best thing around
I'll say it loud

17:12.199 --> 17:15.536
I love my Doozer sticks

17:15.618 --> 17:17.329
One is never enough

17:17.412 --> 17:21.208
Better hurry up
And grab a Doozer stick

17:21.290 --> 17:24.127
-I like it!
-Yeah!

17:26.088 --> 17:28.507
Hammer, you nailed it.

17:31.635 --> 17:34.179
I'm a spokes-Fraggle!

17:40.853 --> 17:43.981
I'm still not totally sold
on these new Doozer sticks.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.066
But I guess if Wembley likes them…

17:46.149 --> 17:49.403
I'm proud of him.
He's really getting himself out there.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.697
I know. You can't miss him.

17:52.364 --> 17:55.993
Well, if it makes him happy and it seems
to make everyone else happy,

17:56.076 --> 17:58.537
then, well, it must be good for everyone.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.247
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.836
They're really different.

18:06.670 --> 18:07.796
Which is great.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.509
That is delicious.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.180
Wembley wear!

18:16.263 --> 18:18.348
Get your Wembley wear!

18:19.600 --> 18:20.851
It's him. It's him.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.353
Say the thing. Say the thing.

18:23.437 --> 18:25.981
-Say it. Say it. Say it.
-Say it.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.983
I like it!

18:28.567 --> 18:31.278
-I love you!
-He said the thing. He said the thing.

18:31.361 --> 18:32.988
-You're welcome.
-We like it too.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.448
I love you too. Yeah.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.618
Wow. I guess I had it in me all along.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.912
It's all a lie, Wembley.

18:39.995 --> 18:43.540
Uh-oh. Did that voice come from in me?

18:43.624 --> 18:46.335
No. You have to listen to me.

18:46.418 --> 18:47.419
What?

18:48.045 --> 18:49.880
Hi. Cotterpin here.

18:50.589 --> 18:52.132
There's a big problem.

18:52.216 --> 18:56.053
The Fraggles are only pretending
to like the Doozer sticks.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.554
-What?
-Look.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.474
I am enjoying this.

19:01.225 --> 19:03.018
Me too. So earthy.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.647
Too bad they're only available
for a limited time.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.732
I could eat a skyscraper.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.114
What do you think now?

19:16.198 --> 19:18.867
So? The Fraggles
are throwing them in the water.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.370
It's not hurting anybody.

19:23.956 --> 19:25.082
Really?

19:25.165 --> 19:28.627
Your sticks… are melting into goo,

19:28.710 --> 19:32.881
and the goo is giving all us Merggles--

19:32.965 --> 19:34.424
Just a second.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.262
Nonstop hiccups!

19:40.806 --> 19:42.850
I don't know what to do.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.602
On one hand, the poor Merggles.

19:46.436 --> 19:49.064
But on the other hand,
I've seen all the good

19:49.147 --> 19:51.859
that the ad campaign
has done for the Doozers.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.405
What do you think, Cotterpin?

19:56.488 --> 20:02.578
I think you've got the spotlight,
and it's up to you how to use it.

20:03.579 --> 20:04.746
Yeah.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.418
Wembley, there you are.

20:09.501 --> 20:12.212
We're about to announce
the new double Doozer stick.

20:13.005 --> 20:15.174
Everybody's going to be there.

20:15.257 --> 20:19.469
The double stick, now with more stick.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.097
Perfect.

20:22.181 --> 20:26.018
Anyway, see you out there.
We're all counting on you.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.519
-No. Don't say--
-Bye.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.484
It's gonna be so good.

20:34.568 --> 20:36.445
-There he is.
-There's Wembley.

20:36.528 --> 20:37.654
Guys, listen. I'm--

20:37.738 --> 20:41.033
They're the best things around
I'll say it loud

20:41.116 --> 20:43.911
I love my Doozer sticks

20:45.704 --> 20:48.540
I like it. Yeah, yeah.

20:48.624 --> 20:52.711
Listen, guys. I'm having a hard time
making up my mind about something--

20:52.794 --> 20:56.173
That's the old Wembley.
Take a look at that guy up there.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.592
-That guy is confident.
-And cool.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.302
-No.
-And good under pressure.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.180
-And sage.
-Yeah. We are so proud of you, buddy.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.225
We can't wait
for the double-stick presentation later.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.811
Speaking of which, let's get good seats.

21:09.895 --> 21:13.398
-One is never enough, better hurry up
-Hold on, hold on.

21:13.482 --> 21:15.817
And grab a Doozer stick

21:15.901 --> 21:16.902
I just--

21:18.403 --> 21:19.696
Let's do it again.

21:20.489 --> 21:22.699
Heavy stuff, huh?

21:25.619 --> 21:27.579
So proud of him, you know?

21:30.415 --> 21:32.668
-I'm so excited by this.
-What's happening?

21:35.879 --> 21:37.256
Good evening.

21:37.798 --> 21:39.591
I'm Jack Hammer.

21:39.675 --> 21:41.343
-Yes.
-Yeah.

21:41.426 --> 21:42.427
Look at this.

21:42.511 --> 21:48.517
Fraggles, Doozers, coming together over
their shared love of the Doozer stick.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.686
-Yeah.
-It gives me chills.

21:50.769 --> 21:53.939
It's also cold in here.
If somebody could handle that?

21:54.022 --> 21:56.149
-I don't mind.
-Rhonda, can you get that?

21:56.233 --> 21:59.820
And now I give you
Mr. "I Like It" himself…

22:01.238 --> 22:02.823
it's Wembley.

22:04.199 --> 22:06.660
-Wembley! Yeah!
-Yeah, Wembley!

22:06.743 --> 22:08.161
-Wembley!
-Yes!

22:09.371 --> 22:10.372
Hit it.

22:11.623 --> 22:15.294
They're the best thing around
I'll say it loud

22:15.377 --> 22:18.755
I love my Doozer sticks

22:18.839 --> 22:21.175
One is never enough

22:21.258 --> 22:24.386
Better hurry up
And grab a Doozer stick

22:34.730 --> 22:35.898
I don't like it!

22:37.900 --> 22:39.902
-Yeah!
-What? No!

22:41.612 --> 22:44.865
Well, I don't like the taste,
and neither do any of you.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.366
You're just pretending.

22:46.450 --> 22:48.827
No, I really like it.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.165
I can't. They're just bad. Chalky.

22:56.210 --> 22:59.880
I'm sorry, everyone. But this isn't right.

22:59.963 --> 23:02.799
You're not eating them.
You're throwing them in the pond.

23:02.883 --> 23:05.219
It's making the Merggles hiccup.

23:05.302 --> 23:07.554
Thank… you, Wembley!

23:11.558 --> 23:14.186
Look, I'm a wembler,

23:14.269 --> 23:17.814
but there's no wembling about the truth.

23:17.898 --> 23:21.485
We have real problems here
in Fraggle Rock, and, well,

23:21.568 --> 23:23.946
my lies just made things worse.

23:24.613 --> 23:26.532
Well, that stops now!

23:40.337 --> 23:41.338
The--

23:42.506 --> 23:43.882
The--

23:43.966 --> 23:49.221
The ceremonial choosing sound
has been sounded.

23:51.306 --> 23:55.227
Wembley, you have impressed us all
here today.

23:55.310 --> 23:59.106
Will you join us on the Wise Council?

23:59.731 --> 24:00.732
Wow.

24:01.984 --> 24:02.985
Well, I guess I--

24:03.068 --> 24:06.822
No. No guessing. I just will.

24:09.199 --> 24:11.118
That's our Wembley.

24:11.201 --> 24:13.245
I knew it would be one of us.

24:14.288 --> 24:17.499
I didn't see this coming.
That's what makes it sweeter.

24:18.125 --> 24:20.043
See you back in our room!

24:20.127 --> 24:22.171
-I live with that guy.
-Lucky.

24:22.254 --> 24:23.422
I know.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.636
I know I'm not the spokes-Fraggle anymore,

24:29.720 --> 24:32.598
but there is someone
you need to listen to.

24:32.681 --> 24:35.309
And that's my friend, Cotterpin.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.604
So tiny.

24:38.687 --> 24:44.234
Well-- Well, we can't pretend
these problems are just gonna go away.

24:44.860 --> 24:47.946
We're gonna have to take a pause.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.824
Wouldn't that be hard?

24:50.908 --> 24:54.453
Yes, but a great pause now

24:54.536 --> 24:58.457
will make a greater,
more sustainable change for tomorrow.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.460
-That's right.
-Makes sense.

25:01.543 --> 25:05.255
Beauty. Beautiful. Beautiful.

25:07.716 --> 25:11.178
Well, my work here is done.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.180
But you didn't do anything.

25:13.263 --> 25:14.765
Really?

25:14.848 --> 25:18.519
-Or did I nail it?
-What?

25:18.602 --> 25:20.395
Jack Hammer out!

25:20.479 --> 25:23.524
Yes, really. You didn't.

25:29.279 --> 25:30.531
Sprocket!

25:31.490 --> 25:35.369
Sprocket, what happened in here? Sprocket.

25:37.454 --> 25:39.498
Did Doc Bot do this?

25:42.042 --> 25:46.338
Doc Bot is your friend.
Doc Bot is your friend.

25:47.005 --> 25:48.549
Boy, Sprocket.

25:49.132 --> 25:53.095
I tried to shortcut taking care of you,
but that's just not possible.

25:53.804 --> 25:55.764
I was only fooling myself.

25:55.848 --> 25:57.891
From now on, no more robots.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.811
Very good. Very dog.

26:01.645 --> 26:05.274
It's okay. Come here.
You're fine. Okay, okay, okay.
