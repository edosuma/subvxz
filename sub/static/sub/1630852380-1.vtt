00:01.960 --> 00:04.337
Previously on Dynasty...
LIAM:
I did call

00:04.379 --> 00:05.964
a divorce lawyer this morning.
This is goodbye, Fallon.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.590
Not only are you not getting
the family company,

00:07.632 --> 00:09.384
but Cristal's moving
the headquarters here.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.511
JEFF:
Where are you now, Brady?

00:11.553 --> 00:13.138
Alexis.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.390
I'm taking the money,
but I want the glory, too.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.976
So either we make a deal,
or I call the police.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.310
You've been manipulating this
the whole time.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.521
Only because I love you.
I always have.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.690
I'm not spying on you.
Just tell me the truth!

00:23.732 --> 00:26.234
(grunting)

00:26.276 --> 00:27.694
Alexis Colby,
you're under arrest for murder.

00:27.736 --> 00:28.737
What?

00:28.778 --> 00:30.280
Dr. Robert Larson was found dead

00:30.321 --> 00:31.698
on the sidewalk
in front of your building.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.244
(gunshot)

00:36.286 --> 00:38.747
(screaming, shouting)

00:40.582 --> 00:42.751
(indistinct shouting)

00:42.792 --> 00:44.044
Help!

00:47.088 --> 00:48.590
(instrumental
TV news music intro plays)

00:48.631 --> 00:50.508
NEWSMAN:
A somber day here outside

00:50.550 --> 00:52.510
the offices
of Fallon Unlimited,

00:52.552 --> 00:54.554
where mourners have gathered
to pay their respects

00:54.596 --> 00:57.474
to founder and CEO
Fallon Carrington.

00:57.515 --> 01:00.435
The prominent heiress to
the Carrington Dynasty was shot

01:00.477 --> 01:03.271
and killed last night
while attending a campaign gala

01:03.313 --> 01:04.522
for her father,
Blake Carrington.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.066
Sources say...

01:06.107 --> 01:08.068
Seriously?

01:08.109 --> 01:09.986
People actually think
that I'm dead?

01:10.028 --> 01:12.864
The real tragedy here is
that photo they're using.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.200
I was in Belize, my hair was all
frizzed out from the humidity,

01:15.241 --> 01:17.660
and some chick in a thong
tried to steal my beach chair.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.079
It was a bogus tweet
that went viral,

01:19.120 --> 01:20.497
and a few news outlets
ran with it.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.165
Should be cleared up
within the hour.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.918
It better. I don't have time
to be dead right now.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.087
But I'm glad you're here.

01:27.128 --> 01:28.171
Yeah, of course I'm here.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.631
Fallon, you got shot.

01:29.672 --> 01:31.716
I sure did,
and I am going to make sure

01:31.758 --> 01:34.052
the press spins a story
about that lunatic Eva

01:34.094 --> 01:36.012
being the unstable employee
who did this.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.555
Yeah, I guess it's better
the world doesn't know

01:37.597 --> 01:39.140
that Eva was trying to kill you

01:39.182 --> 01:40.767
over some sick obsession
she had with me.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.977
Or that you, uh...

01:43.019 --> 01:44.270
That I slept with Colin?

01:45.814 --> 01:48.691
Trust me, it's just
as painful when I say it.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.652
You know, when
we get home,

01:50.693 --> 01:53.321
maybe we should talk

01:53.363 --> 01:54.823
and figure out some way
to deal with this,

01:54.864 --> 01:56.324
you know, see a counselor or...

01:56.366 --> 01:58.243
Don't need to.
It's in the past.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.995
All that matters is you're okay.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.581
But what about...?
(knocking)

02:03.623 --> 02:05.625
How we feeling
this morning, Ms. Carrington?

02:05.667 --> 02:08.586
Well, I feel great,
but Channel 6 begs to differ.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.214
Uh, your test results are back,
and the exit wound is clean,

02:11.256 --> 02:13.216
so those stitches
should do the trick.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.301
Perfect. I guess
I'll be on my way.

02:15.343 --> 02:18.096
Oh, uh, not quite.
Your white blood cell count

02:18.138 --> 02:20.390
is higher than I'd like. I've
ordered a full blood work-up.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.058
But I just said, I feel great.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.935
Yeah, and the doctor said
they need to run more tests.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.772
Under the circumstances, things
could have been much worse.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.150
You're a very lucky woman,
Ms. Carrington.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.277
Hmm. That's debatable.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.155
BLAKE:
But now that we're sure

02:35.196 --> 02:36.614
that Fallon's okay,
I've got a lot

02:36.656 --> 02:38.241
of ground to make up
on the campaign trail today.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.660
And I've got more work to do
for Flores Incorporado.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.745
I've been reading over
the financial reports

02:42.787 --> 02:45.165
before I start
as the new CEO.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.000
One of the more mundane parts
of the job,

02:47.041 --> 02:49.544
yet hearing you say it
somehow sounds sexy.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.213
I didn't know that Beto was
technically still an employee.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.257
Even though he went
back to Mexico,

02:54.299 --> 02:56.593
he still has account access
and draws a salary.

02:56.634 --> 02:59.512
That sounds like trouble to me.
I'd cut the bastard off now.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.307
I feel bad. The
company's all he had.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.643
He's still a Flores
and my brother.
Mm-hmm.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.645
There's no point in kicking
him while he's down.
Fine.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.106
Don't kick him, but if
I were you, I'd step over him.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.108
Carly, thank you
for coming so early.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.027
Actually, I haven't been
to sleep yet.

03:14.068 --> 03:16.029
Damage control isn't
for the uncaffeinated.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.447
Cavendish is using the chaos

03:17.488 --> 03:18.865
from last night's gala
against you.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.159
How? It wasn't Blake's fault.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.203
Except for his security team
whisked him away to safety

03:23.244 --> 03:25.371
while his daughter bled out
on stage.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.665
Cavendish is smearing
you in the press,

03:27.707 --> 03:29.417
calling you a coward,
among other things.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.419
Fine. Then let's
smear him back.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.379
Set up an on-camera interview.
I've got plenty of juice

03:33.421 --> 03:35.256
on that son of a bitch
if he wants to play dirty.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
Too risky.
Trust me, you cannot afford

03:37.300 --> 03:39.135
to come off more unlikeable
right now.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.596
I'll find another way
to turn this around.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.514
Well, you better do it quick.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.475
I'll be damned if I let
this whole campaign implode

03:45.516 --> 03:47.810
when I'm this close
to the finish line.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.398
(lock buzzes,
latch clicks)

03:52.440 --> 03:55.610
I just spoke to the hospital.
Fallon's gonna be fine.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.820
(sighs)
Apparently, they're sending
her home in a few days.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.531
Oh, thank God.
Now when do I get to go home?

04:00.573 --> 04:01.991
Well, your lawyer is trying

04:02.033 --> 04:03.660
to set your bail hearing
as we speak.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.787
I don't believe
this is happening.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.915
How on Earth can they think
that I murdered someone?

04:08.957 --> 04:10.833
Well, I spoke to the lead
detective, and apparently,

04:10.875 --> 04:14.170
an anonymous 911 phone call
came in at 6:30 last night.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.964
The woman told the operator

04:16.005 --> 04:17.548
that she had just seen
a blonde woman

04:17.590 --> 04:19.968
in a red dress
push a man over your balcony.

04:20.009 --> 04:23.137
I wasn't even home at 6:30,
and it was crimson.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.515
Surely that undermines
the credibility of the caller.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.517
I somehow doubt that.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.519
But we just need
to prove your alibi.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.104
So, where were you at 6:30?

04:31.145 --> 04:34.107
In my car.
I left the hair salon at 6:15,

04:34.148 --> 04:36.484
and arrived
at Blake's party around 7:00.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.486
The police also said

04:38.528 --> 04:40.655
that they found
a five-million-dollar check

04:40.697 --> 04:42.323
in the victim's pocket,
signed by you.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.575
So, they think he was
blackmailing you for something

04:44.617 --> 04:46.953
and-and that you wanted
to put an end to it.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.579
That is absurd.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.832
I made that check out
at Adam's behest.

04:50.873 --> 04:54.502
Adam?
Why would he have you do that?

04:54.544 --> 04:56.587
As an investment
in our new company.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.589
Adam and I were going

04:58.631 --> 05:00.800
into the skincare business
with Dr. Larson.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.219
Wait. Sorry. Um...

05:03.261 --> 05:06.180
So the man who died,
was his...

05:06.222 --> 05:08.182
was his name Dr. Bobby Larson?

05:08.224 --> 05:10.935
That's right. Did you know him?

05:10.977 --> 05:13.730
Um, just a casual acquaintance.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.606
And that helps me how?

05:15.648 --> 05:18.359
It doesn't, uh, but you needn't
worry, because your lawyers

05:18.401 --> 05:20.361
already have investigators
looking for the real murderer.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.780
So just...
just be patient,

05:22.822 --> 05:25.199
and, um...
you'll be out of here soon.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.535
(lock buzzes,
latch clicks)

05:27.577 --> 05:29.245
DOMINIQUE:
How's the patient

05:29.287 --> 05:30.246
feeling today?

05:30.288 --> 05:32.623
Like a fool.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.752
But getting better,
now that I'm back on my meds.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.004
You certainly gave us
all a scare.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.423
It's my own fault.
I should have never stopped

05:40.465 --> 05:42.508
taking the pills
in the first place.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.927
I'm so sorry for everything
I put you through.

05:44.969 --> 05:49.182
I got a lot of apologies
to hand out, even to Brady.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.559
Don't worry.
Brady knows you were sick.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.436
He's very supportive
of your recovery.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.147
Actually,
he's been a huge support

05:56.189 --> 05:59.067
to me these last few weeks, too.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.109
Has he, now?

06:00.151 --> 06:02.487
It's true. In fact,

06:02.528 --> 06:04.697
I'm bringing Brady
into the company.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.699
He's going to handle
the day-to-day business

06:06.741 --> 06:08.659
so that I have more time
to focus on designing.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.037
Mom, the guy's not on the level.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.331
Sweetheart, please.
Look, I admit I was wrong

06:13.373 --> 06:15.666
about him trying to steal
the ColbyCo Space tech.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.835
But I can't shake
these fuzzy memories

06:17.877 --> 06:21.547
of thinking that Brady was
at Alexis's penthouse.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.091
That's ridiculous.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.384
I'm telling you,
they're working together.

06:24.425 --> 06:27.095
Jeff, you were hallucinating.

06:27.136 --> 06:30.264
The doctor said that's normal
after stopping your meds.

06:30.306 --> 06:33.309
Trust me,
the only thing you need

06:33.351 --> 06:36.646
to worry about right now
is resting and getting better.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.189
(sighs)

06:38.231 --> 06:39.607
SAM:
Knock, knock.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.818
A little gift for the patient.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.696
Aromatherapy has proven
to heal both physical

06:45.738 --> 06:48.157
and mental illness.
You'll see.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.659
What I see

06:49.700 --> 06:51.702
is a hospital filled
with oxygen tanks,

06:51.744 --> 06:54.163
so, maybe an open flame
isn't the best idea.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.709
Right.
They kind of stink anyway.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.545
Where's the mister?

07:00.586 --> 07:03.339
He's at La Mirage
packing up his things.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.509
We've canceled the divorce, and
he's moving back into the manor.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.803
Well, isn't that good news?

07:08.845 --> 07:10.638
Yeah, yeah. (groans)
Of course it is.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.473
It's just-- I don't know--

07:12.515 --> 07:14.142
he keeps saying
that everything's fine,

07:14.183 --> 07:16.394
but he was acting weird earlier.
Something is off.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.854
ELLEN:
Fallon.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.772
Oh, thank goodness.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.692
Ellen? Wow. What a surprise.

07:22.733 --> 07:26.487
Uh, Sam, Ellen is on the board
at Fallon Unlimited.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.905
And Ellen, this is Sam.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.866
Good to meet you.
Hello.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.535
Oh. They are so beautiful.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.079
And mostly carnations.
Sam, be a dove?

07:37.415 --> 07:39.375
You know, with Internet
speculation running rampant,

07:39.417 --> 07:40.960
I just wanted to confirm

07:41.002 --> 07:43.963
that you were actually okay...
and alive.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.756
(chuckling):
Uh, me?
Mm-hmm.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.842
Yes, this is just a flesh wound.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.886
I'll be back in the office
in a couple days.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.096
Well, I'm glad to hear it,
but you know,

07:52.138 --> 07:55.183
this incident has highlighted
some concerns

07:55.224 --> 07:56.726
about the
company's future.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.228
Specifically that
there's no line of succession

07:59.270 --> 08:01.272
now that Colin's left.

08:01.314 --> 08:06.194
Oh. Well, Colin was never meant
to be a long-term thing.

08:06.235 --> 08:09.489
Which is why the stock market is
taking a wait-and-see approach

08:09.530 --> 08:10.990
right now,
but perhaps

08:11.032 --> 08:13.242
if someone from the board
were to step in

08:13.284 --> 08:15.578
as acting CEO,
just while you recover,

08:15.620 --> 08:18.206
to show stability
on Wall Street...

08:18.247 --> 08:20.416
(laughs)
What? Stability?

08:20.458 --> 08:22.418
(laughs)

08:22.460 --> 08:24.420
You can call me "Stable Mabel,"

08:24.462 --> 08:26.506
because I've never felt better,
Ellen.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.007
In fact,

08:28.049 --> 08:30.009
I am in the process
of closing a deal

08:30.051 --> 08:31.761
with a new VP right now.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.054
Is he as hot as Colin?

08:33.095 --> 08:34.931
'Cause it'll be hard
to top that.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.682
She is amazing.

08:36.724 --> 08:38.226
I just don't want
to announce her yet,

08:38.267 --> 08:39.727
you know,
before the ink is dry.

08:39.769 --> 08:40.937
I don't want
to jinx it.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.730
I was actually thinking

08:42.772 --> 08:45.191
of introducing her at the
Fallon Unlimited Holiday Party

08:45.233 --> 08:46.734
in a few days.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.319
I see.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.488
And the press?

08:50.530 --> 08:53.407
El, what a great idea!

08:53.449 --> 08:56.035
I will invite the press
to the party.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.079
You know, so they can
meet my new VP

08:58.120 --> 09:00.748
and see that I am
alive and well.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.750
I look forward
to seeing you

09:02.792 --> 09:05.628
and our new VP at the party.
Take care now.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.296
You take care.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.756
(inhales sharply)

09:08.798 --> 09:10.633
(groans)

09:10.675 --> 09:11.968
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay

09:12.009 --> 09:13.302
to go to a party in two days?

09:13.344 --> 09:15.388
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.973
The real question is,

09:17.014 --> 09:19.892
where am I gonna find a new VP
in two days?

09:19.934 --> 09:22.395
I better light a candle
for you after all.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.855
♪ ♪

09:46.586 --> 09:47.920
Tell me you got me my perfect
photo op for my party guests.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.422
I'm trying.
It's not easy

09:49.463 --> 09:51.090
to find eight reindeer
around the holidays.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.675
Oh, and don't forget the, uh,

09:52.717 --> 09:54.260
disfigured one with
the red nose.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.553
It'll really add
a pop of color.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.971
Would you settle

09:57.013 --> 09:58.681
for Shetland ponies
with antlers on?

09:58.723 --> 10:00.683
Kirby, I didn't
temporarily pull you out

10:00.725 --> 10:02.852
of party planner retirement
for you to give me excuses.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.353
Now that I've
invited the press,

10:04.395 --> 10:05.938
this has to be the party
of the season.

10:05.980 --> 10:09.025
Oh, don't worry.
I am all over it. Ooh.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.776
What do you think about
a Winter Wonderland theme?

10:10.818 --> 10:13.613
Yeah, perfect.
Oh, but get me real snow.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.531
I don't want cotton rolled out.
This isn't the mall.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.200
Copy that.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.536
You're supposed to be resting.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.246
I'm in a hospital bed.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.040
If my heart rate were any lower,
I'd be dead.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.000
Mm-hmm.
Good news.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.003
I've done my scouting research
and narrowed down my top pick

10:29.045 --> 10:31.464
for VP to Kelly Sanders.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.466
And this concerns me how?

10:33.507 --> 10:36.052
Well, Kelly is currently working
for BlueStar Universal,

10:36.093 --> 10:39.096
but I'm thinking,
with an enticing offer from me,

10:39.138 --> 10:40.640
I might be able
to lure her away.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.767
Get to the scheme.
I just got off the phone

10:42.808 --> 10:44.518
with her assistant,
and I have a FaceTime meeting

10:44.560 --> 10:46.145
with her set for this afternoon.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.689
But she can't know
I'm in the hospital.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.066
It'll appear weak.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.734
I need to look
healthy and strong.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.319
And let me guess.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.945
I am the only person
who can help you with that.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.823
No, but you are the closest.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.745
BLAKE: Alexis picked a lovely
time to get arrested for murder.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.664
My campaign doesn't need
any more setbacks.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.332
I'm sure it won't be a problem.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.334
Let's not forget,
this entire Senate run

11:08.376 --> 11:10.711
is just a step towards a cabinet
position in the White House.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.213
And there's only so
much family baggage

11:12.254 --> 11:13.881
I can bring along with me.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.883
Carly knows what she's doing.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.301
Let's just trust her plan.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.809
(gasps)

11:24.850 --> 11:26.811
Cristal?

11:26.852 --> 11:28.896
Cristal?!

11:28.938 --> 11:32.858
It's okay, sweetheart. I got
you. Just-just... just relax.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.361
(Blake grunting,
crowd chatter)

11:36.445 --> 11:39.115
(coughs)

11:39.156 --> 11:41.659
Are you okay?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.786
Here, sit down. Sit down.

11:43.828 --> 11:47.039
All right, she's-she's...
she's good. Thank you.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.125
(applause)

11:54.839 --> 11:56.799
KELLY:
When I saw this meeting added

11:56.841 --> 11:59.009
to my schedule,
I was quite surprised.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.011
It's been a while, hasn't it?

12:01.053 --> 12:02.471
I think the last time
we saw each other

12:02.513 --> 12:03.931
was the Fortune 500 Gala.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.766
I must say,
you're looking well.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.560
And thankfully, not dead.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.146
Mmm. Aren't you sweet?

12:10.187 --> 12:12.356
Yeah, after that little
shooting mishap,

12:12.398 --> 12:14.108
I decided to take a quick jaunt

12:14.150 --> 12:16.610
to the Bahamas for a refresh.

12:16.652 --> 12:20.948
But I am very much alive, and
in the market for a new VP.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.783
Any chance you're ready
for a change of scenery?

12:22.825 --> 12:27.538
That's very kind of you, but
I'm happy at BlueStar right now.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.833
Are you, though? I mean,
you work for Mark Tucker,

12:30.875 --> 12:32.501
a man who's never gonna
hand over any real power

12:32.543 --> 12:34.003
in his company to a woman.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.797
I am telling you.
It is a dead-end over there.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.799
But at Fallon Unlimited,
it's a chance

12:38.841 --> 12:40.801
to focus on female empowerment.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.219
I mean,
there's endless job growth

12:42.261 --> 12:44.138
in a much more
interesting field.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.391
Let's just say,
your future would be unlimited.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.851
Thanks, Fallon, but...

12:48.893 --> 12:50.311
Kelly, please.

12:50.352 --> 12:53.022
Wait.
You are the only woman

12:53.063 --> 12:56.734
with the experience
and the smarts for this job.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.320
I need to fill this position
immediately, so,

12:59.361 --> 13:02.072
come on. I'll meet salary
demands, uh, stock options.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.491
What do you want?
Fallon,

13:03.532 --> 13:05.034
I'm flattered, really.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.327
I'm sure you're gonna find
a great candidate.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.995
It's just not going to be me.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.581
See you at the next gala?

13:11.916 --> 13:13.751
Sure. Why not?

13:13.793 --> 13:16.587
Oh, thank God.
That was exhausting.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.797
I'm so screwed.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.716
Oh. Perfect timing, Doc.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.468
I need to check out now.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.179
I'm having a major work crisis.
I'm afraid not.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.223
I just got
your test results back.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.432
Your white blood cell numbers

13:28.474 --> 13:29.475
aren't coming down
like I had hoped.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.643
I feel fine, really.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.561
Fallon, that could indicate

13:32.603 --> 13:34.647
any number of serious problems.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.482
Discharging you is a liability
to the hospital.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.485
(sighs)
I won't be signing
a release form anytime soon.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.531
(sighs)

13:44.990 --> 13:47.743
Oh, there's
the prodigal son now.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.037
Amanda. As usual,

13:50.079 --> 13:52.206
your dry wit escapes me.
You know,

13:52.248 --> 13:53.666
I can't believe
that you didn't have the decency

13:53.707 --> 13:55.417
to visit our mother
in jail last night.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.212
I was tending to my favorite
sister at the hospital.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.797
And if you knew

13:59.839 --> 14:01.590
anything about mine
and Fallon's relationship,

14:01.632 --> 14:04.051
you would know
just how low that rates you.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.470
You know, Alexis really needs
our help right now.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.389
Yeah, I called her lawyer.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.975
Oh, she's really got her
work cut out for her.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.852
I can't believe Mother would
actually commit murder.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.438
Yeah, I can't believe it,
either.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.357
Especially since,
well, you were the one

14:18.399 --> 14:20.150
who had a motive to kill Bobby.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.903
You know, 'cause we both know
you stole his anti-aging drug.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.657
No. Dr. Larson
and I had an agreement.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.826
We were going to work together
with Mother.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.369
And I have no idea
why he was

14:30.411 --> 14:31.996
even at the penthouse
last night.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.747
Oh, I have an idea.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.666
Whatever agreement you came to
wasn't good enough.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.168
So you pushed him
over the balcony.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.879
Okay, uh,

14:39.920 --> 14:42.756
if you're so certain
that I'm guilty of anything,

14:42.798 --> 14:44.258
why don't you just go talk
to the police?

14:44.300 --> 14:46.260
That's exactly what
I intend to do.

14:46.302 --> 14:50.222
Just as soon as I can
prove it, which I will.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.893
Trust me.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.196
Wow. Somebody's angling
for husband of the year.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.198
Actually, these are
from the manor.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.200
The condolence
flowers keep coming.

15:10.242 --> 15:13.829
Do people only read
the news once a week?

15:13.871 --> 15:15.831
I mean, how many tweets
do I have to send out

15:15.873 --> 15:17.541
with the hashtag
"Still Breathing"?

15:17.583 --> 15:20.920
Relax. The people closest
to you know that you're alive.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.882
You're right.
Thank God for you.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.635
I'm glad you're back
at the manor where you belong.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.766
Are you sure you don't want
to talk about things?

15:33.807 --> 15:36.769
There's nothing to talk about.
We're good, really.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.146
Okay, because... I don't know.
(phone chiming)

15:39.188 --> 15:41.565
It just kind of feels like...
No!

15:41.607 --> 15:44.735
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What's happening?!
What now?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.321
The Fallon Unlimited stock is in
a freefall. I don't understand.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.615
Wall Street said they were
taking a wait-and-see approach.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.700
What happened?
Fallon, have you seen this?

15:51.742 --> 15:53.702
Of course I saw it.
I get alerts to my phone

15:53.744 --> 15:55.621
whenever there are major
stock fluctuations.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.666
Actually,
I was referring to this.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.668
"Scandal is unfolding

16:00.709 --> 16:04.296
"behind the scenes of multimedia
conglomerate Fallon Unlimited.

16:04.338 --> 16:08.300
"Sources reveal
that CEO Fallon Carrington

16:08.342 --> 16:11.011
"was caught having
a tawdry affair

16:11.053 --> 16:12.805
with consultant
Colin McNaughton."

16:12.846 --> 16:14.348
It's insane, right?

16:14.390 --> 16:15.933
The stuff
these rags come up with.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.231
I'm gonna go to the gift shop.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.276
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.112
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

16:28.153 --> 16:30.072
I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.991
We need to issue a denial
in the press.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.118
Or better yet,
threaten a lawsuit.
Fallon,

16:34.159 --> 16:36.036
once it's out there,
you can't dispel the rumors.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.705
But half of the world thinks
I'm dead,

16:37.746 --> 16:39.373
and the other half thinks
our marriage is a sham.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.000
I have to get
out of here!

16:41.041 --> 16:44.044
Wait. Hang on.
Who's the source that told IPZ?

16:44.086 --> 16:46.922
Besides Amanda and Colin,

16:46.964 --> 16:49.425
there's only one other person
who knew the truth.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.762
So I know we don't know
each other that well,

16:53.804 --> 16:55.389
and I know that this does
sound crazy,

16:55.431 --> 16:57.141
but I'm telling you
that he has motive.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.393
When it comes to Adam,
it usually is crazy.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.811
But can you prove it?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.938
Well, no, not yet,
but that's why I'm here.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.774
I went to the police station,
I listened to the 911 tape.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.943
And a call came in
from a woman at 6:30.

17:07.985 --> 17:10.571
But wasn't Adam here at Blake's
party around that time?

17:10.612 --> 17:12.406
Well, I don't know. I didn't
get here until after 8:00.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.657
Do you know
what time he got here?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.325
There's an easy way to find out.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.370
Yo, Danny?
Can you pull up

17:18.412 --> 17:19.913
the license plate photos
of all the cars

17:19.955 --> 17:21.123
that we parked the other night
at the party?

17:21.165 --> 17:22.750
Yeah. I got you, boss.
Hang on.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.419
For insurance purposes,
we photograph

17:25.461 --> 17:27.337
and time-stamp each of the cars
that our crew parks.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.256
Great.
All right,
and here you go.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.175
A list of every car that came in
and out that night.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.302
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

17:34.219 --> 17:37.973
(clears throat)
Okay. So Adam drives

17:38.015 --> 17:40.601
a gray Lamborghini.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.394
Bingo. This must be him.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.064
Shows him coming in at 6:26 p.m.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.484
Wait, are you sure? 'Cause
that's around the same time

17:48.525 --> 17:50.944
that the 911 call came in
outside the penthouse.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.197
I hate to say it,
but the man can't be

17:53.238 --> 17:54.656
in two places at the same time.

17:54.698 --> 17:58.327
Carlos, blue Bentley!
Ticket 358.

17:58.368 --> 18:01.121
Tres, cinco, ocho.
Bring her around!

18:02.039 --> 18:03.499
You're right.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.584
He certainly couldn't be
in two places at once.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.630
It was here in this trendy
Stone Mountain eatery

18:09.671 --> 18:11.465
where the incident occurred.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.008
Eyewitness video shows

18:13.050 --> 18:15.469
the third Mrs. Carrington
gasping for breath

18:15.511 --> 18:18.597
after nearly choking to death
on a side salad.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.767
It seems the Carrington Curse
is alive and well.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.977
Where the hell's the part
about me being a damn hero?!

18:24.019 --> 18:25.604
CARLY:
Looks like most

18:25.646 --> 18:27.648
of the news outlets are only
focused on Cristal.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.817
Of course they're focused
on her and not me.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.819
Everyone assumes I'm
gonna save my own wife.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.737
Blake, calm down.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.031
I should have just paid a damn
stranger to choke to death.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.033
I admit this was
a miscalculation on my part.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.743
Looks like people love
a sympathetic victim

18:39.785 --> 18:41.328
more than they do a hero

18:41.370 --> 18:43.330
these days.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.332
Book me an interview,

18:45.374 --> 18:47.251
like I should have done
in the first place.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.007
(speaking Spanish)

18:59.763 --> 19:02.891
DOMINIQUE:
I don't know why
I didn't think of this sooner.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.144
A partnership
makes perfect sense.

19:05.185 --> 19:08.605
Well, as long as we can continue
to mix business and pleasure.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.524
Oh. (laughs)

19:10.566 --> 19:13.610
Sorry to interrupt. Dom, I just
left Jeff at the hospital.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.987
He is improving by the minute.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.405
Thanks for visiting him,
Michael.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.157
You're a good friend.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.659
And allow me
to say thank you

19:20.701 --> 19:22.327
again.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.829
You're a lifesaver, man.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.789
I was trying to save
two people that night.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.209
Jeff was in pretty bad shape,
but like I said, doing better,

19:29.251 --> 19:31.044
especially after I brought him
his laptop like he wanted.

19:31.086 --> 19:34.798
Oh, that boy. He is not
supposed to be working.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.009
Besides,
didn't he destroy that thing?

19:37.050 --> 19:38.385
I guess he backs up everything

19:38.427 --> 19:39.970
on a second laptop
in his office.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.722
But don't worry.
He's not working.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.265
He's just playing around
with some GPS

19:43.307 --> 19:44.725
program or
something like that.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.226
But I will
drop by tomorrow

19:46.268 --> 19:48.145
after work
to see how he's doing.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.607
Enjoy.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.986
Strange, Jeff wanting
his computer so badly.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.821
Wonder why.

19:57.863 --> 20:01.033
It probably has something to do
with his distrust of you.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.786
He thinks you and Alexis
are plotting against me.

20:04.828 --> 20:08.040
Alexis? That's ridiculous.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.625
I've never even met the woman.

20:09.666 --> 20:12.169
I know that,
but remember, Jeff is ill.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.338
And it's going to take time
before he's well again.

20:24.097 --> 20:27.017
Ow! Watch it, Urkel.
Precious cargo here.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.394
Sorry. I never got
my gurney license.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.688
How do you get out
of this place?

20:31.730 --> 20:33.232
Oh, by all means,
take your time.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.484
I will pull this gurney over
right now.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.652
FALLON:
Shh.

20:36.693 --> 20:38.612
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down there.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.907
This isn't the ER. Besides,
it's not like this patient's

20:41.949 --> 20:44.076
going anywhere. You
going down to the morgue?

20:44.117 --> 20:45.410
Oh, yeah. You, uh...
you don't want

20:45.452 --> 20:46.828
to see what's under here.
It's ugly.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.122
Tragic, really.
Texting and driving.

20:49.164 --> 20:52.334
Sort of a whole after-school
special kind of thing.

20:52.376 --> 20:56.588
(groans)
Anyway, uh, have a great night.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.392
Eva.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.935
Orange looks good on you.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.895
I always said you
were an autumn.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.855
You're here for some sort
of an apology?

21:14.898 --> 21:16.275
Because I am sorry

21:16.316 --> 21:18.235
that I missed.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.861
You should have aimed
a little higher

21:19.903 --> 21:21.571
if you were hoping
for a kill shot.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.573
I wasn't aiming for you.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.534
I wanted Liam dead.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.203
If I can't have him, no one can.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.914
Right. Okay.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.583
Well, I didn't come here
to serve as your therapist,

21:33.625 --> 21:35.168
although you should definitely
look into one.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.588
I'm here because of
the IPZ article.

21:38.630 --> 21:42.676
I'm sorry. I did have
to guess some things.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.429
Like, I didn't know if you
and Colin had sex on your desk

21:45.470 --> 21:49.266
or on the couch,
so I just said both.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.019
Do you really think anyone is
gonna believe that crap?

21:52.060 --> 21:53.979
Think they already do.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.106
You humiliated me

21:56.148 --> 22:00.152
in the press,
so I wanted to return the favor,

22:00.193 --> 22:03.780
let the world know just what a
two-faced whore you really are.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.116
Let's wrap this up, shall we?

22:06.158 --> 22:09.536
I will ask the DA to give you
a very light sentence

22:09.578 --> 22:11.621
and provide endless
commissary money,

22:11.663 --> 22:14.791
if you retract your story
in the press.

22:14.833 --> 22:18.754
Otherwise, I push
to keep you here forever.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.881
What's it gonna be?

22:23.008 --> 22:26.011
It's like you said,

22:26.053 --> 22:28.972
orange really is my color.

22:33.685 --> 22:34.811
(sighs)

22:34.853 --> 22:36.730
Being married to
Blake has been

22:36.772 --> 22:39.566
the biggest blessing
of my life.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.527
And I am proud to stand by
his side during this campaign.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.447
Speaking of which,
your opponent in the race

22:45.489 --> 22:48.617
has doled out some pretty harsh
criticisms toward you

22:48.658 --> 22:50.285
as of late.
How do you respond?

22:50.327 --> 22:52.579
Well, it's simple. Scott
Cavendish tells a lot of lies.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.377
But the truth is,

22:58.418 --> 23:00.462
sometimes I do feel cursed.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.130
I've dealt

23:02.172 --> 23:04.508
with a lot of tragedy
in my life.

23:04.549 --> 23:08.095
My beloved grandmother was taken
by cancer when I was a child,

23:08.136 --> 23:10.389
dying right in front of me.

23:12.724 --> 23:15.644
I... I lost a second father

23:15.685 --> 23:17.687
in Joseph Anders
earlier this year

23:17.729 --> 23:20.065
to a-- just a horrible
car accident.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.776
And then my wife,

23:22.818 --> 23:24.986
my daughter...
I'm sorry. It's just

23:25.028 --> 23:26.655
sometimes it is a lot.

23:26.696 --> 23:29.908
Do you need a moment?
No, no, I will be fine.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.701
Look, I have considered

23:31.743 --> 23:33.703
quitting this race many times,

23:33.745 --> 23:37.749
but it was my family that
encouraged me to keep fighting.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.459
So I am staying
in it for them.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.379
For Anders.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.881
For my dear, sweet grandmother.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.134
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

23:48.093 --> 23:50.053
Thank you.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.097
Mother, I've been so worried.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.310
How are you holding up?

23:57.352 --> 24:00.605
I'm not sure how much longer
I can stand this hell.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.984
The champagne is lukewarm
at best.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.986
Well, hopefully, that'll all
come to an end today

24:06.027 --> 24:07.612
with your bail hearing.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.489
It absolutely will.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.533
Once the judge looks
at the evidence, he will see

24:11.575 --> 24:13.618
that I had nothing to do
with Dr. Larson's death.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.121
But now,
do you know why

24:16.163 --> 24:17.914
he was in the penthouse
to begin with?

24:17.956 --> 24:19.916
I saw him earlier that day,

24:19.958 --> 24:22.335
uh, where I gave him
your check.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.588
I thought maybe
he'd come 'round

24:24.629 --> 24:27.382
later to hassle you,
maybe wanting more.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.178
Did you get into a fight

24:31.219 --> 24:32.846
and just push him over the edge
in a rage?

24:32.888 --> 24:34.181
It's okay if you did.
It can be our little secret.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.516
What?! I had nothing
to do with it.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.852
No. Okay. Uh, yeah, sure.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.354
But you know,
the-the 911 caller did say

24:41.396 --> 24:43.356
it was a woman
with blonde hair,

24:43.398 --> 24:45.525
which Amanda has.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.777
Yeah, she could have put on
a red dress and framed you.

24:47.819 --> 24:50.030
Easily.
I've been warning you about

24:50.071 --> 24:52.282
that British trollop
since day one.
Adam.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.826
Amanda is not a murderer,
and neither am I.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.204
The real killer
is still out there,

24:57.245 --> 24:59.331
and I have hired a team
of investigators

24:59.372 --> 25:01.124
who will find that person.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.418
Mm. Right.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.420
Well, just know

25:05.462 --> 25:08.507
that whatever you need,

25:08.548 --> 25:10.509
I'm always here for you.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.511
Thank you, darling.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.262
I know I can
always count on you.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.598
Of course you can, yeah.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.936
She was trying to kill Liam?

25:20.977 --> 25:22.938
Kirby! Could you maybe not
scream it out

25:22.979 --> 25:25.440
for everyone to hear?
I don't want Liam to know.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.483
How come?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.443
Because he's trying to move on,

25:28.485 --> 25:30.153
and I've already caused him
enough pain,

25:30.195 --> 25:31.696
so why add guilt into the mix?

25:31.738 --> 25:33.114
Where are we with party prep?

25:33.156 --> 25:34.658
Everything's a go,

25:34.699 --> 25:35.909
including that ice-skating
rink you wanted.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.286
Great. Hey,
give Tara Lipinski a call

25:38.328 --> 25:40.038
and just see
if she'll do a number.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.915
She owes me one after bailing
on my tenth birthday party

25:41.957 --> 25:43.333
for Stars on Ice.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.001
(gasps) Ooh.
Hey.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.586
You okay?

25:46.628 --> 25:49.214
I must have popped a stitch,
but I'm fine.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.632
Maybe it wasn't a good idea
for Dr. Stover

25:50.674 --> 25:51.883
to discharge you last night.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.345
Where were you all morning?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.973
Funny story. And remember,

25:58.014 --> 26:00.892
I've suffered a lot
of emotional trauma,

26:00.934 --> 26:04.437
too, lately, so don't
get mad at me, but, um,

26:04.479 --> 26:06.815
I went to visit Eva in jail.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.110
Why would you do that?

26:10.151 --> 26:13.905
And I have to make another run
to the gift shop.

26:14.864 --> 26:18.702
You were the one who said
issuing a denial wouldn't work.

26:18.743 --> 26:21.121
So I felt the only other option
was to go to her

26:21.162 --> 26:22.998
to try to get her
to retract her story,

26:23.039 --> 26:24.499
but the little psycho refused.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.418
But, Fallon, we don't
need a retraction.

26:26.459 --> 26:28.420
Just like we don't need
to issue any denials.

26:28.461 --> 26:29.754
It's not that big of a deal.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.423
It is a huge deal.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.466
My stock is still tanking.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.719
When you are a CEO
in the public eye,

26:35.760 --> 26:38.096
you can't just have an affair
with your brand-new consultant.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.849
Not to mention, half of
the world still thinks I'm dead.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.851
I need to show everybody

26:42.892 --> 26:45.520
that this IPZ story is all
rumor, that there is no divorce

26:45.562 --> 26:47.314
on the horizon,

26:47.355 --> 26:48.773
and that I am alive and well.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.150
And how do you plan to do that?

26:50.191 --> 26:52.485
With a tiny,
little public appearance

26:52.527 --> 26:54.946
at the Fallon Unlimited
Holiday Party.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.004
Brady.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.006
What a nice surprise.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.633
Is that my laptop
you're holding?

27:14.674 --> 27:17.093
Hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.554
Uh, Dominique asked me
to come grab this.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.015
She's worried
you're working too much.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.976
Or you wanted
to steal the computer

27:25.018 --> 27:26.394
because my
GPS software

27:26.436 --> 27:28.355
proves you've been working
with Alexis

27:28.396 --> 27:30.357
all along.

27:30.398 --> 27:32.901
Jeff, come on, man.
That's crazy.

27:32.942 --> 27:35.111
I think you're still
just a little bit confused.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.405
Actually, things are clearer

27:37.447 --> 27:39.407
than they've been
in a long time.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.993
You can keep
the computer.

27:42.035 --> 27:44.037
I got the confirmation I needed,

27:44.079 --> 27:46.623
and backed it up to the cloud
just in case.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.709
(laughs)

27:52.128 --> 27:54.381
Maybe I did come here
looking for a payday.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.718
And when Alexis offered me
the right amount, I took it.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.137
But I'm not worried, Jeff,

28:01.179 --> 28:03.640
because no one's
gonna believe someone

28:03.682 --> 28:05.809
who's got so many screws loose.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.105
I didn't want
to believe him.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.317
But now I do.

28:23.201 --> 28:26.246
(jazz version of "God Bless Ye
Merry Gentlemen" plays)

28:26.287 --> 28:28.289
Thank you.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.712
There you are.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.463
Who knew mingling

28:35.505 --> 28:37.215
with the company gen pop
could be so exhausting?

28:37.257 --> 28:39.718
No one said proving you're alive
was gonna be easy.

28:39.759 --> 28:41.386
Hmm.
Besides, Fallon,

28:41.428 --> 28:42.804
you should be taking it slow.
Let's sit down.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.097
Not yet. Come dance with me.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.890
No, no, no, Fallon. I really...
Come on!

28:45.932 --> 28:47.809
It'll be a great
photo op for the press.

28:47.851 --> 28:50.353
Dancing really sells
marital bliss. Come on.

28:51.771 --> 28:54.315
Okay. Here we go.

28:54.357 --> 28:55.984
Just keep smiling,
and with any luck,

28:56.025 --> 28:58.027
we will wipe those
scandalous headlines

28:58.069 --> 29:00.113
right off the IPZ homepage.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.198
Hopefully, when I
announce my new VP,

29:02.240 --> 29:03.992
our stock will start
to course-correct.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.536
Wait. You found someone? Who?

29:06.578 --> 29:08.455
Um, I'm not sure yet.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.835
Sam is hiring me
some German actress.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.378
I requested
a Marlene Dietrich type.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.797
You know, strong,
confident, but still sexy.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.008
What? Aren't you worried

29:20.049 --> 29:21.718
that people will figure out
that she's not legit?

29:21.760 --> 29:23.928
No, no. No one's gonna know.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.765
Okay, I'll just say she's some
corporate bigwig from Frankfurt,

29:26.806 --> 29:29.017
or, you know, one of those other
cold-sounding schnitzel towns.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.561
Yeah, that doesn't have disaster
written all over it.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.563
It'll be fine.
Listen, in a few weeks,

29:33.605 --> 29:35.523
when I find my real VP,

29:35.565 --> 29:37.525
I'll just put out
a press release saying

29:37.567 --> 29:39.819
a deal could not be reached
and I found someone else.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.446
It's easy.
Okay.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.114
Keep smiling for the cameras.
Remember?

29:43.156 --> 29:44.032
Marital bliss.

29:48.453 --> 29:51.289
Maybe we should go mingle
with the other guests.

29:53.416 --> 29:56.419
(photographers clamoring)

29:57.378 --> 29:59.172
(camera shutters click,
Fallon laughs)

29:59.214 --> 30:01.216
Dominique, please.
It's not what you think.

30:01.257 --> 30:04.427
You told me
you had never even met Alexis,

30:04.469 --> 30:06.137
yet you were trying

30:06.179 --> 30:09.724
to steal a computer that proved
you two were in cahoots?

30:09.766 --> 30:12.227
Okay, it's a little
like what you think.

30:12.268 --> 30:13.561
Just let me explain.

30:13.603 --> 30:16.648
Stop. You're insulting me now.

30:16.689 --> 30:20.235
I admit I came here
with ulterior motives.

30:20.276 --> 30:22.529
Those guys I told you
I owed money to?

30:22.570 --> 30:24.489
They're actually alive and well.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.241
But once I got here,

30:26.282 --> 30:28.660
I started to have feelings
for you again, Dom.

30:28.701 --> 30:32.247
Oh, you're good.
I'll give you that.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.249
It's the truth.
(scoffs)

30:34.290 --> 30:36.251
But then they followed me here,
threatening me

30:36.292 --> 30:38.503
if I didn't make good
on my debt.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.839
So when Alexis offered me enough
to pay them off,

30:40.880 --> 30:42.882
I went along with it.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.926
I was never gonna
keep your money.

30:44.968 --> 30:48.179
Just the money
from Alexis, I promise.

30:48.221 --> 30:51.015
Your promises mean nothing
to me anymore.

30:51.057 --> 30:53.309
First you tell me
the bad guys were in prison.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.103
Then you tell me
they were dead.

30:55.144 --> 30:59.315
And now, they're alive
and well in Atlanta?

30:59.357 --> 31:03.027
Everything you say is a lie,

31:03.069 --> 31:05.363
and it always has been.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.158
It's over, Brady.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.996
Now get the hell out
of my sight.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.544
SAM:
Okay, here she is now.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.921
Fallon, this is Marta.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.215
Marta, das ist Fallon.
(chuckles)

31:24.257 --> 31:26.301
What the hell is this?

31:26.342 --> 31:29.637
I told you sexy German executive
type. Where did you find her?

31:29.679 --> 31:32.098
At the Bavarian Festival. She
runs her own kielbasa stand.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.100
I thought that would
count as business-savvy.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.269
Oh. Wow.

31:36.311 --> 31:37.645
What? I was
in a hurry.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.522
I'm gonna have to abort.
I mean, I can't

31:39.564 --> 31:41.900
possibly introduce Maria
Von Lederhosen to everybody.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.526
People will know that I'm lying.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.361
Fallon, it's your time
to take the stage.

31:45.403 --> 31:48.031
Music, on standby.
Go on two.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.490
No. Wait, wait. I'm not ready.

31:49.532 --> 31:51.451
(laughing):
Fallon, people are waiting.

31:51.492 --> 31:53.244
She's totally
good on waving.

31:54.537 --> 31:56.122
You like kielbasa?

31:56.164 --> 31:58.124
Forget it. Forget it.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.168
This is a disaster.
What am I gonna do?

32:00.209 --> 32:03.046
Fallon?

32:03.087 --> 32:05.214
Kelly? What are you doing here?

32:05.256 --> 32:07.216
Sorry to crash your party.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.718
I saw the story.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.720
Oh, well, about that...

32:10.762 --> 32:12.138
You know how those tabloids
can spin a tale.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.140
I don't care what the truth is.

32:14.182 --> 32:17.393
I've seen my CEO have countless
affairs with female employees,

32:17.435 --> 32:19.896
and he walks away
unscathed every time.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.440
So if there's still an opening,

32:22.482 --> 32:24.150
I'd love to work
at Fallon Unlimited.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.944
I can't believe

32:25.985 --> 32:27.904
it took that stupid trash piece
to change your mind.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.989
Guess I just needed
a little nudge.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.166
Beto?

32:41.751 --> 32:43.711
I thought
you went home to Mexico.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.505
What could have possibly
brought you back to Atlanta?

32:45.546 --> 32:47.507
You know exactly why I'm here.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.509
First, you stole my job
at Flores Incorparado.

32:49.550 --> 32:51.469
Now you're cutting me off
completely?

32:51.511 --> 32:53.930
Yes, I thought it was best
to sever all ties

32:53.972 --> 32:57.350
between you and the company.
A clean break.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.102
I'm still a Flores.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.853
I have a right to be included.

33:00.895 --> 33:02.855
We had to blow it up a little,

33:02.897 --> 33:05.942
but that's you in the photo,
isn't it?

33:05.984 --> 33:08.444
The one holding a gun?

33:10.405 --> 33:12.865
Club employee was
taking pictures at the gala.

33:12.907 --> 33:15.368
He didn't realize he caught
the real show in the back.

33:17.453 --> 33:19.414
Who were you aiming for, Beto?

33:19.455 --> 33:22.333
Blake or me?

33:23.751 --> 33:26.295
Or maybe both?

33:26.337 --> 33:29.173
Whatever rights you had
as a Flores are now gone.

33:29.215 --> 33:31.426
You're a disgrace
to the family name.

33:31.467 --> 33:34.137
I'm giving you one final chance

33:34.178 --> 33:36.889
to stay out of our lives
and leave Atlanta.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.226
Otherwise, I go to the police.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.397
JUDGE McNEIL:
Case number 9735,

33:44.439 --> 33:47.817
The State of Georgia
v. Alexis Colby.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.819
The defendant has been charged
with the crime

33:49.861 --> 33:51.904
of murder in the first degree.
How do you plead?

33:51.946 --> 33:55.491
Not guilty, Your Honor,
by reason of sanity.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.660
(laughter)
McNEIL:
Thank you, Mrs. Colby,

33:57.702 --> 34:00.329
for that clarification.
Given the evidence,

34:00.371 --> 34:03.207
I see no reason why
we can't set bail at this time.

34:03.249 --> 34:05.501
Your Honor, if I may?
The state just received

34:05.543 --> 34:07.462
additional evidence
in this case.

34:07.503 --> 34:09.630
Autopsy results
have been released,

34:09.672 --> 34:11.049
and the defendant's
hair follicles were found

34:11.090 --> 34:12.633
under the victim's fingernails.

34:12.675 --> 34:14.093
(gallery gasping, murmuring)
That's impossible!

34:14.135 --> 34:15.678
Even if I was there,

34:15.720 --> 34:17.889
I don't shed like some sort
of cocker spaniel.

34:19.974 --> 34:22.101
I know I can always
count on you.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.519
Oh, of course you can.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.897
And I'm gonna do
whatever it takes

34:25.938 --> 34:28.983
to get you clear
of these bogus charges.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.985
WRIGHT:
Based on this new evidence,

34:31.027 --> 34:34.781
Your Honor, the state moves
to deny Mrs. Colby bail.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.409
I'm inclined to agree.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.660
The court hereby orders

34:39.702 --> 34:41.662
Mrs. Colby remain in custody

34:41.704 --> 34:43.623
until her trial date is set.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.500
Court adjourned.

34:45.541 --> 34:47.293
Wait. No! Your Honor,

34:47.335 --> 34:49.295
I will not stay another night
in this roach motel.

34:50.213 --> 34:52.590
This is outrageous! (grunts)

34:52.632 --> 34:54.425
(Alexis grunts,
attorney gasps)

34:54.467 --> 34:55.760
McNEIL:
Order in this court!

34:57.178 --> 34:59.388
(yelling)

34:59.430 --> 35:02.183
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pervert!

35:02.225 --> 35:04.018
(yelling)

35:04.060 --> 35:07.563
I'm innocent, I tell you!
Innocent!

35:10.358 --> 35:12.318
(soft jazz playing)

35:12.360 --> 35:14.487
Hey.

35:14.529 --> 35:17.365
You missed
my big VP announcement.

35:17.406 --> 35:19.659
Good news:
she speaks English

35:19.700 --> 35:22.078
and isn't collecting
Social Security yet.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.123
Yeah, I heard. Congrats.

35:27.166 --> 35:29.919
So, I, uh,
guess you're all done?

35:29.961 --> 35:32.797
I am, but I hope we're not.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.759
What is going on with you, Liam?

35:36.801 --> 35:38.886
I mean, what's going on with us?

35:38.928 --> 35:40.304
Uh, Fallon...

35:40.346 --> 35:41.722
And please don't tell me
everything's fine,

35:41.764 --> 35:43.808
because clearly, it's not.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.434
I mean, what?
You can't even kiss me now?

35:51.107 --> 35:53.609
It's him, okay?

35:53.651 --> 35:55.278
I can't stop
thinking

35:55.319 --> 35:57.947
about how the last person
you kissed was Colin.

35:57.989 --> 36:01.576
I understand how hard
this must be for you.

36:01.617 --> 36:03.244
That's why I wanted
to talk about it,

36:03.286 --> 36:04.704
but every time
I brought it up,

36:04.745 --> 36:06.247
you just told me
everything was fine.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.915
Well, Fallon, I didn't think
I had a choice.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.792
What does that mean?

36:09.834 --> 36:13.004
It means how can I act like
a victim when you got shot?

36:13.045 --> 36:14.755
So you are angry?

36:14.797 --> 36:17.008
Yes, I'm angry!

36:17.049 --> 36:19.468
I'm angry that I wasn't allowed
to be angry!

36:21.053 --> 36:23.639
Fallon, you cheated on me.

36:23.681 --> 36:24.891
I may have cheated,
but at least

36:24.932 --> 36:26.559
I owned up to what I did,

36:26.601 --> 36:28.186
and I'm trying
to work through it.

36:28.227 --> 36:29.395
You're the one who can't face
your part in this.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.022
Oh, my part?
Yeah.

36:31.981 --> 36:34.442
I told you,
Eva was just a friend,

36:34.483 --> 36:36.110
nothing more.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.112
That is not
what I'm talking about.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.114
When all is said and done,

36:40.156 --> 36:43.576
you trusted a manipulative
psychopath over your own wife!

36:43.618 --> 36:46.037
Don't you dare
make me the bad guy here.

36:46.078 --> 36:47.705
You did this to us.

36:49.081 --> 36:51.542
And I'm not sure
I can ever forgive you for it.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.135
Fallon?

37:02.094 --> 37:05.431
Fallon. Hey, hey.
Fallon. Fallon.

37:10.978 --> 37:13.231
The hashtag "Carrington Strong"
is trending on social media.

37:13.272 --> 37:15.024
Looks like
your interview worked.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.442
Well, of course it worked.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.152
Can't believe
you ever doubted me.

37:18.194 --> 37:19.654
I guess that story
about your grandmother helped.

37:19.695 --> 37:22.114
It did.
Dear old Grandma Carrington.

37:22.156 --> 37:24.242
You know,
she was a raging alcoholic

37:24.283 --> 37:26.244
that drove her car
into the lake.

37:26.285 --> 37:29.705
Wretched woman. But you
know, I just don't think

37:29.747 --> 37:32.500
that the truth would have
had the same impact.

37:32.541 --> 37:34.919
People really do love
a good sympathy story.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.171
Which is why it earned me
a bump in the polls.

37:38.130 --> 37:40.341
I've taken the lead
over Cavendish.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.469
Looks like I'm gonna
be Georgia's

37:43.511 --> 37:45.012
next senator after all.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.181
Well, that's not
our only good news.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.558
I pulled the plug on Beto
like you suggested.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.852
He's out of our lives forever.

37:51.894 --> 37:54.021
Well, now, there's something
I can drink to.

37:55.314 --> 37:57.566
Next stop-- the White House.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.530
♪ ♪

38:07.868 --> 38:09.453
This seat taken?

38:09.495 --> 38:11.455
Uh, no.

38:11.497 --> 38:13.582
Pl... Please.

38:17.503 --> 38:20.715
I, uh, always enjoy the
company of a pretty woman.

38:20.756 --> 38:24.176
(Southern accent):
Oh. Aren't you sweet?

38:24.218 --> 38:26.512
It's been a week.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.931
Lost my job, my roommate
ghosted me on the rent.

38:28.973 --> 38:32.518
Ah. Sounds like
you could use a friend.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.562
And a drink.
First one on me?

38:34.603 --> 38:37.523
Thank you.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.817
I'm starting to think
I showed up at the right time.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.819
Oh, you showed up
at the perfect time.

38:41.861 --> 38:45.614
You know, you remind me
of someone I used to know.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.993
♪ Day after day ♪

38:49.035 --> 38:53.789
♪ After day after day... ♪

38:53.831 --> 38:57.168
I think I found something
that can help Alexis.

38:57.209 --> 38:58.544
Well, apparently,
she's gonna need it.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.795
I heard she was
denied bail.

38:59.837 --> 39:01.255
Okay, listen to this.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.673
It's a copy
of the 911 call from that night.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.300
WOMAN:
I swear I just saw a man fall

39:04.342 --> 39:06.344
from the top
of a high-rise on 4th and Main.

39:06.385 --> 39:09.347
Some lady with blond hair,
wearing a red dress--

39:09.388 --> 39:11.599
I saw her push him!

39:11.640 --> 39:12.767
She pushed him off the balcony!

39:12.808 --> 39:14.060
I don't get it.

39:14.101 --> 39:15.853
I thought
you knew all this already.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.521
No. Okay, this time, ignore
the caller, and just listen

39:17.563 --> 39:19.148
to what's happening in
the background. I'll turn it up.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.858
WOMAN:
I just saw a man fall
from the top

39:20.900 --> 39:22.526
of a high-rise
on 4th and Main...

39:22.568 --> 39:25.404
MAN: Ticket 284,
dos, ocho, cuatro.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.156
WOMAN:
...I saw her push him.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.115
MAN: Bring her around.
She pushed him off the balcony!

39:28.157 --> 39:29.116
Hold on. Is that...

39:29.158 --> 39:30.951
A La Mirage valet?

39:30.993 --> 39:32.661
(beeps)
Sounds like it to me.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.497
Which means the caller wasn't
outside the penthouse.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.832
She was here.
So it is possible

39:36.874 --> 39:39.085
that the murder took place
before 6:30 p.m.

39:39.126 --> 39:43.047
Which means that Adam is still
very much a suspect.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.759
Hospitals can be so dreary.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.053
Thought I'd bring you
a little Christmas cheer.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.889
Oh, thanks. I appreciate it.

39:51.931 --> 39:54.266
It'll look good
in my living room.

39:55.434 --> 39:58.229
Doctor said I've been responding
well to the treatment,

39:58.270 --> 40:00.398
so I can go home tomorrow.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.274
Jeff, that's wonderful!

40:02.316 --> 40:03.692
But before

40:03.734 --> 40:07.571
we celebrate,
I owe you an apology.

40:07.613 --> 40:09.740
I'm sorry for not believing you
about Brady.

40:09.782 --> 40:14.036
Forget it. I'm just happy
you finally accepted the truth.

40:14.078 --> 40:17.289
I've already called my lawyer
about filing the divorce papers.

40:17.331 --> 40:19.417
Good.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.001
Let's hope Brady doesn't
put up a fight.

40:21.043 --> 40:23.879
Not if he knows
what's good for him he won't.

40:23.921 --> 40:26.674
You are looking
at the new Dominique Devereaux,

40:26.715 --> 40:28.592
stronger than ever

40:28.634 --> 40:31.971
and ready to take on
the world. (laughs)

40:32.012 --> 40:34.723
(beep, phone dialing)

40:36.392 --> 40:40.729
It's me. I found that rich lady
Lloyd's married to.

40:40.771 --> 40:44.483
If he doesn't pay up, we'll get
our money from her instead.

40:44.525 --> 40:47.486
(rhythmic beeping)

40:50.239 --> 40:53.325
Hey. Just got
your text message.

40:53.367 --> 40:54.743
I didn't even know
you had left the party.

40:54.785 --> 40:55.911
Is Fallon okay?

40:55.953 --> 40:57.163
I don't know.

40:57.204 --> 40:58.873
The doctor's with her now.

40:58.914 --> 41:01.584
Oh, this is all my fault.
I-I was mad, I yelled at her.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.586
What happened?
It's a long story.

41:03.627 --> 41:06.297
No, Fallon was right.
I shouldn't have believed Eva

41:06.338 --> 41:08.048
in the first place.
I'm responsible for this.

41:08.090 --> 41:09.758
Don't. You cannot blame yourself

41:09.800 --> 41:11.635
just because that nutjob
was trying to kill you

41:11.677 --> 41:13.053
and shot Fallon instead.

41:13.095 --> 41:15.097
What?

41:16.140 --> 41:20.644
Which is something
Fallon clearly didn't tell you.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.398
Dr. Stover?

41:24.440 --> 41:27.067
How's she doing?

41:27.109 --> 41:29.528
Although the exit wound
from the shooting was clean,

41:29.570 --> 41:33.282
it seems the bullet nicked
a tiny part of her intestine,

41:33.324 --> 41:35.284
and that went undetected.

41:35.326 --> 41:38.913
It's caused a severe
infection in her bloodstream.

41:38.954 --> 41:44.001
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
Fallon has fallen into a coma.
