WEBVTT

00:06.047 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:10.010 --> 00:11.928
I answered you because you promised

00:12.012 --> 00:14.889
I'd win the Battle of the Bands.
Now you want sacrifices.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.267
We promised you'd win, and you will.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.519
We just want one thing in return.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.396
To join a band of amateurs?

00:21.896 --> 00:24.024
Please. How can I win with them?

00:24.107 --> 00:26.026
I have a reputation to maintain.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.903
We know you're better than them,
so we chose you

00:28.987 --> 00:31.698
to help expose them
for the frauds they are.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.826
Those people have no place at EWS,
but you do.

00:34.909 --> 00:35.994
Who are you?

00:38.663 --> 00:39.664
You'll know soon.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.292
The Lodge is dead.

00:44.335 --> 00:46.046
It's clear you're a Colucci.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.797
Stubborn,

00:47.881 --> 00:51.551
ambitious, arrogant.
You think the world owes you everything.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.179
Your dad was right.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.974
My dad? What about him?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.851
Maybe we were wrong about you.

00:59.934 --> 01:02.145
A weak kid who has no future in music,

01:02.228 --> 01:05.523
or in business school, for that matter.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.859
My dad's an idiot.

01:07.942 --> 01:10.403
If you really want to show your talent,

01:10.487 --> 01:13.156
you need to win the Battle of the Bands.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.200
Help us take out Jana and her friends,

01:15.283 --> 01:17.577
and you'll have a spot
in the winning band.

01:18.078 --> 01:18.912
Oh yeah?

01:19.788 --> 01:21.539
And what happens if I don't?

01:24.542 --> 01:28.671
If you think Kuri was expelled
because of that video, you're wrong.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.299
They kicked him out because we said so.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.719
We can do the same to you,
so it's your choice.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.639
You're either our friend or our enemy.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.953
MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GO ON STAGE TONIGHT

02:05.208 --> 02:07.502
Where are you going so early, Shakira?

02:08.336 --> 02:09.629
I'm meeting MJ.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.090
She wants to go over some riffs.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.592
I love how excited you are
about the competition.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.054
I thought MJ was
going to meet her golden boy.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.182
Go.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.725
It's an important day.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.602
Enjoy being her backup plan.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.480
Go on.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.164
BATTLE OF THE BANDS

02:44.247 --> 02:48.334
Emergency drill later. It's mandatory,
to ensure everyone's safety.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.714
Don't forget about the drill.
No running or screaming.

02:52.797 --> 02:53.923
Thanks.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.802
Emergency drill later.
No running or screaming.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.012
For everyone's safety.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.431
ESTEBAN: CAN WE TALK PLEASE?

03:02.390 --> 03:04.225
Emergency drill later…

03:18.031 --> 03:20.200
<i>All I do is think about you, Jana.</i>

03:20.283 --> 03:21.784
<i>-And you lie to me.</i>
<i>-Me?</i>

03:21.868 --> 03:23.244
Give me a break.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.240
SEND ALL FILES? ACCEPT

04:00.323 --> 04:01.658
COPYING FILES TO "ESTEBAN"

04:30.561 --> 04:31.521
ARE YOU COMING?

04:34.440 --> 04:37.527
DIXON: ARE YOU COMING?

04:41.656 --> 04:44.826
JANA: TODAY'S THE DAY!
REHEARSAL AT 12 O'CLOCK. DON'T BE LATE.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.291
Come on.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.127
COPYING FILES TO "ESTEBAN"

04:58.047 --> 05:00.091
Bro, MJ stood me up.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.469
What's going on? Is that Luka's computer?

05:03.553 --> 05:05.930
Yeah. It's not what it looks like.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.225
Please don't say anything.
I'll explain later.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.023
What's up with you two?

05:15.106 --> 05:17.150
Nothing, man. Just chilling.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.695
Just talking about chicks.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.905
Look how Mexican you sound.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.783
You still sound Colombian.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.960
MJ, you scared me.

05:38.379 --> 05:39.505
Can we talk?

05:39.589 --> 05:41.799
Sure. Are you worried about the show?

05:44.594 --> 05:45.470
So?

05:45.553 --> 05:47.638
Can we talk about the Esteban thing?

05:48.139 --> 05:49.390
Oh, that.

05:49.474 --> 05:53.186
You were with Sebas.
I mean, I thought you were.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.480
So you have nothing to apologize for.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.444
But I don't want things
to be weird between us.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.987
You know, we're friends.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.073
Dude, I swear it's fine.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.492
Right now we need to focus on the show.

06:07.575 --> 06:10.953
We'll talk about everything
after the Battle of the Bands. Okay?

06:22.423 --> 06:25.426
Sebas and Emilia make a better couple
than Sebas and Jana, right?

06:25.510 --> 06:27.887
-For sure, Team Emilia always.
-Of course.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.230
INORGANIC TRASH

06:37.313 --> 06:38.689
What is this?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.029
ORGANIC - INORGANIC

06:57.917 --> 06:59.335
Do you like being alone?

07:00.670 --> 07:01.879
I enjoy being alone.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.465
But what about you?

07:04.549 --> 07:05.800
How's Sebas?

07:05.883 --> 07:08.511
The whole school's talking about you two…

07:13.433 --> 07:15.309
You don't always have to be alone.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.400
Why didn't we make merch for our show?

07:23.693 --> 07:26.237
Why do girls fall for the stupidest guys?

07:27.238 --> 07:30.032
People always fall for the wrong person.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.535
I wonder how many times
he made a fool of me.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.912
I bet he cheated on me a lot
and I never knew.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.707
The worst part is
people think he's perfect.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.792
Unbelievable.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.798
I'll break into his room during the drill.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.717
That's a crime, Jana.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.843
Not necessarily.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.345
It's looking for evidence.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.892
Let's make a plan during rehearsal.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.393
No.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.730
I just lost my appetite.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.024
Jana. Jana, don't.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.860
This is the worst day to act like that.

08:07.904 --> 08:08.905
Something wrong?

08:12.408 --> 08:13.659
Well, let's see.

08:14.660 --> 08:18.998
Nothing's wrong, just…
if you can't come to practice,

08:19.081 --> 08:20.374
just tell me, it's fine.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.670
I completely forgot. It's just that…

08:24.754 --> 08:27.715
I don't know what I was thinking.
The show's so important.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.593
I was so busy and, Esteban…

08:34.847 --> 08:35.848
I'm sorry, okay?

08:36.682 --> 08:37.767
See you later.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.352
You don't have to go, MJ.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.317
I'm guessing you want an explanation.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.655
Bro, you went through Luka's things,

08:50.738 --> 08:51.906
you kissed MJ,

08:51.989 --> 08:54.951
you're being all mysterious.
What's going on?

08:55.034 --> 08:57.453
Kissing MJ was a misunderstanding, okay?

08:57.537 --> 08:58.496
How?

08:59.997 --> 09:01.249
Wait, do you like her?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.210
Dude, there's nothing between us.

09:04.293 --> 09:06.671
Nothing. I promise.

09:06.754 --> 09:07.713
Really?

09:08.756 --> 09:09.590
Trust me.

09:10.841 --> 09:11.884
What about Luka?

09:14.262 --> 09:16.055
Luka's a different story.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.182
I know it sounds weird, but…

09:18.766 --> 09:21.852
Just trust me.
I'll tell you everything later.

09:23.854 --> 09:24.689
All right.

09:25.940 --> 09:26.941
Thanks, dude.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.408
Have you talked to her?

09:37.326 --> 09:39.453
She says she doesn't want
to talk about it.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.666
So she's giving you the cold shoulder?

09:44.292 --> 09:45.126
Worse.

09:46.502 --> 09:47.670
She's being polite.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.339
What about Esteban?

09:51.382 --> 09:53.843
Do you mind if we change seats?
I need to talk to her.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.011
Of course he minds.

09:55.094 --> 09:58.598
He chose this seat.
You can't just change whenever you want.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.560
Excuse me.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.481
Jana, please. Just let me explain.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.649
It's not fair.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.277
What?

10:12.778 --> 10:14.322
She won't let you move on.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.742
You want to talk to her,
but she's not willing.

10:18.659 --> 10:22.413
Let me tell you something.
Jana is an emotional terrorist.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.291
An "emotional terrorist"?

10:25.374 --> 10:26.375
Is that a thing?

10:27.001 --> 10:28.127
Obviously.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.796
She's cruel, manipulative,

10:31.339 --> 10:33.466
but she seems like the Virgin Mary.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.428
She made you apologize, right?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.142
Why apologize?

10:43.643 --> 10:44.894
Esteban isn't hers.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.021
Plus, she was dating Sebas.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.357
I'm telling you, she likes to win.

10:54.028 --> 10:57.156
Are you all excited
to start the Battle of the Bands?

10:59.992 --> 11:03.120
Twenty bands will take the stage tonight,

11:03.204 --> 11:06.123
but only eight will move on
to the next round.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.958
I hope you're prepared.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.752
Good luck to all of you.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.634
Jana, we need to talk. Please.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.803
If it's about the band, text me.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.805
Obviously, it's not about the band.

11:20.888 --> 11:21.972
It's about us.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.140
Us?

11:24.016 --> 11:27.269
If there ever was anything between us,
let's leave it behind.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.437
The band comes first.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.564
No. I know you care about the band--

11:30.648 --> 11:31.565
Jana.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.359
What?

11:33.442 --> 11:34.860
-We need to talk.
-No way.

11:34.944 --> 11:35.778
What?

11:35.861 --> 11:37.697
She said no. Bye.

11:38.447 --> 11:42.034
Jana, can you tame the hick?
He doesn't know who I am.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.786
I know exactly who you are.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.830
-I'm gonna fuck you up.
-Go ahead.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.498
Enough, both of you.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.876
You're not getting it,
so I'll make myself clear.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.628
I'm not talking to either of you.

11:53.170 --> 11:56.507
So if you want to beat each other up
or compare dicks, go ahead.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.967
But leave me out of it.

12:00.761 --> 12:01.971
Mine's bigger.

12:03.681 --> 12:04.598
Moron.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.645
How's my Colombian brother?

12:11.272 --> 12:12.815
Hey, what's up?

12:14.233 --> 12:15.609
What do you want, dude?

12:16.402 --> 12:18.654
Relax, I'm just asking how you are,

12:18.738 --> 12:19.905
how you're feeling,

12:19.989 --> 12:21.866
how you're doing with the band…

12:24.243 --> 12:27.288
-Are you high?
-No, not at all.

12:27.371 --> 12:30.666
I just saw you talking to MJ,
Jana, and Esteban.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.669
It must be hard
being caught up in their soap opera.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.087
Did Jana give you orders?

12:35.171 --> 12:36.297
Look, man.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.466
Just speak directly.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.634
Jana controls everyone.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.803
How we play, what we have to do.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.848
Like we're her employees.
"Do this, do that."

12:45.931 --> 12:47.600
Yeah, but we're not.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.559
Exactly.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.895
Maybe you should remind her.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.563
Luka.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.234
What's up with you and Esteban?

12:58.402 --> 12:59.236
Esteban?

13:00.654 --> 13:01.739
I have standards.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.073
Why?

13:03.991 --> 13:04.867
No reason.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.036
All good, man.

13:13.042 --> 13:13.959
Very good.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.796
BIOLOGY EXAM: A+

13:19.423 --> 13:21.425
BIOLOGY EXAM: F

13:21.509 --> 13:23.010
An F.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.345
It's a new record.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.263
Not one to be proud of.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.432
I'll have to notify your parents.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.728
I can help you study if you want.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.363
Biology is so boring.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.407
What is this?

13:45.908 --> 13:48.369
This is literally the first time
you've talked to me.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.871
Well, there's a first for everything.

13:50.955 --> 13:54.834
Right. That's why
I'm wondering what the deal is.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.043
Nothing, really.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.713
I thought we could commiserate.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.966
We have some things in common, don't we?

14:02.049 --> 14:04.426
-You mean how we're both…
-Horrible at biology.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.428
-And many other things.
-Right.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.430
I'm sure you're failing like me.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.808
It's hard, right?

14:10.891 --> 14:13.477
Jana has us rehearsing all day.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.437
The competition is driving her crazy.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.149
Some of us have real problems.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.945
Let's just hope it stops once we play.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.918
For someone who hates this band,
you're very punctual.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.879
I'm always on time.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.256
You know what I don't get?

14:42.882 --> 14:47.428
I know the character you're playing
is mysterious, shy.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.180
A newcomer. It works with girls.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.391
But why are you here?

14:53.392 --> 14:55.144
I'm setting up the equipment.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.271
I know you're setting up. I'm asking…

14:58.814 --> 15:00.774
I hate to say it, but you're talented.

15:02.651 --> 15:06.739
So what are you doing
playing in this little amateur band?

15:06.822 --> 15:08.449
Is everything okay at home?

15:09.658 --> 15:11.035
With your dad, your mom…

15:12.286 --> 15:13.287
What are you saying?

15:13.370 --> 15:14.747
It's your mom, then.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.334
That's why you always want to please Jana,

15:18.417 --> 15:20.002
doing whatever she wants.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.045
So eager.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.008
-Where is everyone?
-They're coming.

15:26.508 --> 15:27.468
It's early.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.636
Relax.

15:35.476 --> 15:36.894
So? What do you think?

15:39.521 --> 15:41.148
Sebastián Langarica

15:41.231 --> 15:44.193
has the perfect stats
to be part of The Lodge.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.405
That is, if their requirements
haven't changed.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.618
I've been here four years

15:52.701 --> 15:56.163
and I've never seen the board
make a decision so quickly.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.248
-Can you close the blinds?
-Yes.

16:04.713 --> 16:08.342
I don't normally do this
on the job, but would you like one?

16:08.425 --> 16:10.010
No, thank you.

16:11.845 --> 16:15.307
They spent longer deciding
whether to buy new blackboards

16:15.391 --> 16:18.477
than they did investigating
if Sebastián is involved.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.522
They want to avoid issues with the mayor.

16:21.605 --> 16:22.523
I know.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.067
The Lodge disappeared

16:25.150 --> 16:26.527
when I was a student here.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.364
Or that's what they wanted
everyone to think.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.660
Those types of groups
don't just suddenly disappear.

16:34.743 --> 16:35.911
Anita.

16:36.662 --> 16:40.708
The Lodge was just a bunch of kids
pretending to be a secret society.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.085
They were never that powerful.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.588
But you still look worried.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.840
Of course I am.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.967
I don't want this to get out of control.

16:53.262 --> 16:57.182
<i>Keep going until the end</i>
<i>Never looking back</i>

16:57.266 --> 17:01.103
<i>No excuses</i>

17:01.186 --> 17:02.980
<i>Keep going until the end</i>

17:03.063 --> 17:05.607
<i>Never looking back</i>

17:13.198 --> 17:14.033
Hell yeah.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.409
Hey, guys.

17:15.993 --> 17:19.913
I know you're all tired and hungry,
but I just need five minutes

17:19.997 --> 17:21.373
to discuss the rehearsal.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.001
I thought we sounded fine.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.544
Yeah, we did. It's just…

17:25.627 --> 17:26.712
What now?

17:26.795 --> 17:27.629
Say it.

17:28.255 --> 17:31.425
I wanted to say
that tonight is very important.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.469
It's our chance to shut everyone up.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.471
Now you're telling us how to play.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.513
No.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.183
I was just thinking that,
for example, Dixon…

17:39.850 --> 17:40.684
What?

17:40.768 --> 17:43.228
I know you're used to performing alone.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.522
But now there are six of us on stage,

17:45.606 --> 17:48.400
so we have to be more aware of the space.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.236
-I don't understand.
-Let me translate, Dixon.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.030
You're stealing her shine.

17:53.113 --> 17:56.075
Luka, please stop stirring the pot.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.868
Okay, can we hurry this up?

17:57.951 --> 17:59.703
I have to go study.

17:59.787 --> 18:00.954
Yes, of course.

18:01.038 --> 18:01.872
Andi.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.626
Just one thing.
Please, please, please don't be late.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.253
Come on, I was only late once.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.171
On the drums.

18:13.801 --> 18:17.137
I'm sorry, but if I don't say it,
no one else will.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.849
-MJ.
-So now she wants to talk.

18:21.350 --> 18:25.270
I know you've been experimenting
with your look, and that's okay, just…

18:25.354 --> 18:28.315
Now you're telling us how to dress?

18:28.398 --> 18:31.985
No, but if we're a band,
we need a cohesive look.

18:32.069 --> 18:32.903
Are we a band?

18:35.531 --> 18:36.365
What?

18:36.448 --> 18:38.283
It seems like it's your band.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.703
MJ's right,
it seems like it's all about you.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.498
I'm only trying to help us win!

18:44.581 --> 18:45.749
Or beat your ex?

18:46.834 --> 18:49.503
It feels like you're just using us
to get back at him.

18:52.339 --> 18:53.841
Do you all think that?

18:57.094 --> 18:58.971
Okay, screw this. The band is done.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.639
Right. There's no band without you.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.016
Play without me. I don't give a fuck.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.893
<i>Sound test.</i>

19:04.977 --> 19:07.104
<i>Emergency drill in progress.</i>

19:11.567 --> 19:12.401
Dixon.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.113
So, can you help me?

19:16.196 --> 19:17.447
After what just happened?

19:19.741 --> 19:20.701
No way, Jana.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.455
All together.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.417
Remember, go to the meeting point.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.631
I KEPT MY END OF THE DEAL
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN

19:36.425 --> 19:38.260
Remember, don't run…

19:47.936 --> 19:49.771
COPYING FILES TO "ESTEBAN"

20:01.033 --> 20:02.034
Careful, no running!

20:02.117 --> 20:04.995
Are you still mad
that I stood you up earlier?

20:05.662 --> 20:06.496
Yes.

20:06.997 --> 20:10.167
But if you think I'm only mad
because you stood me up,

20:10.959 --> 20:12.419
then you don't get it.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.838
…this is for everyone's safety.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.381
Get what?

20:16.465 --> 20:18.425
Go to the meeting point, please.

20:18.508 --> 20:22.429
So you pretend to be with Sebas
in front of the whole school,

20:22.512 --> 20:25.265
but then you kiss me behind the dumpster?

20:25.349 --> 20:29.561
No. I'm just in the middle
of a marketing strategy.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.980
-Andrea Agosti.
-That's you.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.025
You say I'm not your dirty little secret,

20:35.108 --> 20:36.485
but I am, aren't I?

20:36.568 --> 20:37.444
Just a little.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.738
Only until we win the Battle of the Bands.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.324
Unless you're not interested.

20:42.908 --> 20:43.742
Yeah. I am.

20:43.825 --> 20:44.993
Andrea Agosti!

20:45.077 --> 20:45.953
Present.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.014
Young man?

21:06.598 --> 21:09.935
Mr. Langarica,
the drill is required for everyone.

21:50.767 --> 21:51.977
What are you doing here?

21:52.060 --> 21:53.312
We have to go now.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.522
Jana.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.441
You can't keep pushing us away.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.986
I guess I've been feeling insecure.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.156
Why did you kiss her?

22:08.076 --> 22:09.578
I thought we had something real.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.997
That's what I tried to tell MJ.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.001
That I like you.

22:21.006 --> 22:21.923
I like you a lot.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.095
I like you a lot too.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.474
So why did you get back with Sebas?

22:30.557 --> 22:33.310
Because I'm sure he's behind The Lodge.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.437
I had to get close to him to prove it.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.440
You could've told me that.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.318
-I was going to tell you when--
-It doesn't matter now.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.322
No, not anymore.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.004
<i>Jana Cohen?</i>

23:04.716 --> 23:05.926
Esteban Torres?

23:20.857 --> 23:21.983
Are you sure?

23:22.734 --> 23:23.610
Yes.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.914
Your room's a mess.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.165
Shut up!

23:37.749 --> 23:39.376
<i>Esteban Torres.</i>

23:39.459 --> 23:41.711
Ms. Jana Cohen's missing too.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.382
They're probably making out, Anita.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.755
Look, there they are.

24:29.509 --> 24:30.760
Enough, enough.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.600
-Yes?
-Sorry, we were just…

24:36.683 --> 24:38.143
It was my fault.

24:38.226 --> 24:39.978
I got lost, and Jana helped me.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.480
You poor thing.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.440
You're so absent-minded,

24:43.523 --> 24:45.859
and Ms. Cohen is so altruistic.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.321
-You'll have to pick up all the equipment.
-Okay.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.158
You have work to do.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.075
Yes, going.

24:57.662 --> 24:58.497
Esteban.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.124
Your zipper.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.342
MJ.

25:10.842 --> 25:11.801
Can we talk?

25:11.885 --> 25:14.012
More comments? Criticism?

25:14.095 --> 25:16.097
No, I want to apologize.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.894
I know I've been a dumbass.

25:22.562 --> 25:23.772
I'm sorry for that.

25:27.567 --> 25:30.111
I totally ignored your feelings.

25:32.447 --> 25:35.492
I know I haven't been
the best friend I could be,

25:36.368 --> 25:38.662
but really, I haven't had much practice.

25:40.455 --> 25:43.792
I don't know how to be in a band either,
but I'm trying.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.254
So I wanted to see

25:48.046 --> 25:50.006
if we could try being friends again.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.011
Basically

25:56.096 --> 25:57.514
it's like this.

25:58.598 --> 26:02.394
You're the closest thing to a friend
I have in this country.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.478
You too, dude.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.688
I know.

26:06.022 --> 26:09.734
I'm not the kind of person
who judges other people's lives.

26:10.235 --> 26:13.446
And if you want to be with Jana, or MJ,

26:13.530 --> 26:16.950
or Andi, or with all of them
at the same time, it's fine.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.911
Just like it's fine if you like Luka.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.621
Don't laugh, I'm serious.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.541
I understand you're obsessed with him.

26:24.624 --> 26:26.876
That's why you wanted him in the band,

26:26.960 --> 26:29.713
and why I caught you
snooping in his computer the other day.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.340
There's nothing wrong with admiration.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.176
But admiration and obsession
are different.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.263
There's a fine line between
admiration and stalking.

26:38.346 --> 26:39.848
No, seriously.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.809
Don't cross that line.
I'm telling you as your friend.

26:42.892 --> 26:46.187
Look, Dixon, I'm not bisexual.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.230
Come on.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.065
Dude, it's not a big deal.

26:49.149 --> 26:52.027
We're in the 21st century,
even I swing that way a bit.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.863
If I were,

26:55.447 --> 26:57.616
I'd have no problem admitting it, but…

27:00.619 --> 27:01.953
the thing is,

27:02.871 --> 27:04.497
it's a bit more complicated.

27:05.915 --> 27:08.460
Aren't I owed an explanation
as your friend?

27:11.129 --> 27:14.090
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

27:22.182 --> 27:23.850
You can't tell anyone, okay?

27:24.768 --> 27:25.685
Not even Jana.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.103
Bro,

27:28.063 --> 27:29.356
my lips are sealed.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.067
Okay.

27:36.571 --> 27:38.615
I didn't come to this school for music.

27:40.992 --> 27:41.826
Actually,

27:42.327 --> 27:45.080
I don't give a shit
about the Battle of the Bands.

27:45.830 --> 27:46.873
So?

27:49.084 --> 27:50.502
I'm here to find my mom.

27:50.585 --> 27:51.461
What?

27:55.340 --> 27:56.591
When I was a kid,

27:57.717 --> 27:59.010
my mom left us.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.722
My dad told me she died soon after, but…

28:04.724 --> 28:06.267
I know she's still alive.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.361
Look, that's her.

28:16.444 --> 28:17.529
Her name is Rocío.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.784
She's a musician too.

28:22.867 --> 28:23.952
Yes.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.370
That's beautiful.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.997
Where is she?

28:29.165 --> 28:30.667
I have no idea.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.836
I came here to find out.

28:33.420 --> 28:37.006
She was a music teacher,
and her last student…

28:39.008 --> 28:39.843
was Luka.

28:39.926 --> 28:40.760
Luka?

28:45.181 --> 28:49.310
Wait, so does Luka know where she is?

28:49.394 --> 28:51.438
I don't think so. I don't know.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.733
But I'm sure his father, Marcelo,

28:54.816 --> 28:56.526
knows exactly where she is.

28:57.026 --> 28:57.944
There's more.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.363
Look at this.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.993
It's a letter from Marcelo to my mom,

29:05.827 --> 29:09.372
asking her to stay away from his family
and promising money.

29:10.498 --> 29:12.917
ROCÍO
FORGIVE ME FOR WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY…

29:15.670 --> 29:17.130
This is really fucked up.

29:19.674 --> 29:21.801
How long have you been looking for her?

29:24.304 --> 29:25.680
A long time.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.265
Too long.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.100
But now I'm going to find her.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.394
I have Luka within reach.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.986
There's something I still don't get.

29:40.069 --> 29:41.654
Something's not adding up.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.825
How the hell did you know Luka was here?

29:48.161 --> 29:50.997
<i>It's official. Say hello</i>
<i>to the next star of EWS.</i>

29:58.338 --> 30:00.632
CAN WE MEET IN THE REHEARSAL ROOM, PLEASE?

30:02.383 --> 30:04.511
Please don't tell anyone.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.095
Please.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.640
Dude, I told you.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.100
My lips are sealed.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.061
Cool, man.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.354
Cool.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.271
Great.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.233
Whatever you're going to say, be quick.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.193
I want to apologize.

30:20.276 --> 30:21.152
I overstepped.

30:22.028 --> 30:24.739
This isn't just about me,
it's about all of us.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.908
We're stronger together,

30:26.991 --> 30:29.828
and together, we're going to win
the Battle of the Bands.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.705
But I know my words might not mean much.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.457
Are you really going to sing?

30:35.458 --> 30:37.085
It's what I do best.

30:37.585 --> 30:40.338
Isn't this a little <i>High School Musical</i>?

30:41.005 --> 30:42.006
All right.

30:47.095 --> 30:51.516
<i>I know I can be a pain</i>

30:51.599 --> 30:53.810
<i>And a bit cruel</i>

30:54.769 --> 30:57.730
<i>I know I like control</i>

30:57.814 --> 31:00.859
<i>But I have issues of my own</i>

31:02.652 --> 31:04.821
<i>I know I need you</i>

31:04.904 --> 31:08.658
<i>Because you make me better</i>

31:10.034 --> 31:12.287
<i>And we're stronger</i>

31:12.370 --> 31:17.333
<i>When we're together</i>

31:21.671 --> 31:23.715
<i>Forgive me</i>

31:30.722 --> 31:34.350
<i>I won't do it again</i>

31:38.062 --> 31:39.022
Do you forgive me?

31:42.525 --> 31:43.443
Come here.

31:45.737 --> 31:46.821
It's okay.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.324
All right.

31:53.119 --> 31:55.663
She won them back with a song,
what can I do?

31:56.539 --> 31:58.374
<i>You can still redeem yourself.</i>

31:58.458 --> 32:01.294
<i>Bring Esteban</i>
<i>to the rehearsal room at 7:15.</i>

32:01.377 --> 32:02.211
What for?

32:04.213 --> 32:05.298
<i>Does it matter?</i>

32:14.557 --> 32:16.184
Ready, man?

32:17.518 --> 32:19.062
Dude, I was born ready.

32:20.313 --> 32:21.356
Come on.

32:22.231 --> 32:23.399
Yeah, just a second.

32:23.483 --> 32:26.361
MEET YOU IN THE REHEARSAL ROOM AT 7:15.
I NEED YOUR HELP BEFORE THE SHOW!!!

32:26.444 --> 32:28.738
-I'll catch up in a second.
-Sure.

32:41.834 --> 32:42.669
Dixon?

32:46.631 --> 32:50.134
I just wanted to say thank you
for supporting me with my "stuff."

32:50.927 --> 32:52.595
I didn't find any evidence,

32:52.679 --> 32:56.307
but I'm pretty sure
Sebastián Langarica is behind this.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.267
I know he is.

32:59.936 --> 33:00.770
Partner.

33:01.354 --> 33:02.188
Partner.

33:02.271 --> 33:04.607
<i>Welcome to the first round</i>

33:04.691 --> 33:06.317
<i>of the Battle of the Bands.</i>

33:08.861 --> 33:10.947
Here, we'll select the eight bands

33:11.030 --> 33:13.074
that will move on to the next round.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.826
Let's get started, shall we?

33:20.957 --> 33:24.335
WHERE ARE YOU?

33:24.919 --> 33:28.756
Put your hands together for XY!

34:46.834 --> 34:47.794
Are you okay?

34:47.877 --> 34:48.711
Yes.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.756
-Have you seen Esteban?
-No.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.182
Luka, have you heard from Esteban?

35:01.265 --> 35:03.893
Why? Did you lose your boyfriend already?

35:18.282 --> 35:19.784
They're so good.

35:53.693 --> 35:54.694
Are you guys ready?

35:55.987 --> 35:57.196
No, Esteban's missing.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.700
Okay, well he'd better get here soon.
You're on in two minutes.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.088
Nothing.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.298
Nothing at all.

38:46.365 --> 38:48.242
