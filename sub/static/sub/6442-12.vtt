01:11.270 --> 01:14.535
Good run, everybody.
Don't forget to stretch it out.

01:16.241 --> 01:18.300
Mr. Altman.

01:19.578 --> 01:22.706
I wanted to come by.

01:22.881 --> 01:25.475
If there's anything I can do....

01:25.651 --> 01:29.246
There's nothing that any
of us can do now.

01:30.589 --> 01:33.353
She really loved this time of year.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.427
You were really focused out there...

01:43.602 --> 01:47.060
...speaking as one
of the dozens you passed.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.907
-I'm Lana.
-Jordan Cross.

01:51.076 --> 01:53.704
I just started here a couple days ago.

02:16.301 --> 02:17.632
-Sorry.
-No, it's okay.

02:17.803 --> 02:20.601
There's a lot more where that came from.

02:22.941 --> 02:26.741
Hey. Nice job out there today.
When are you gonna join--?

02:35.053 --> 02:36.486
--the team?

02:36.655 --> 02:37.747
You all right?

02:48.900 --> 02:50.834
Jordan.

02:51.003 --> 02:53.164
The totally overwhelmed look
gave you away.

02:53.338 --> 02:54.669
I'm Clark.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.274
Right. The mentor guy. Hi.

02:57.442 --> 03:01.037
We were supposed to meet in the gym.
They said you bolted. Is everything okay?

03:01.213 --> 03:04.842
I'm still getting used to all these people.
I was home schooled up until now.

03:05.017 --> 03:08.145
Allow me to be your lifeline.
All new students are assigned a mentor...

03:08.320 --> 03:11.585
...mostly because they have a map.
Here's the lay of the land.

03:11.757 --> 03:14.351
Would you mind if l
checked with my dad?

03:18.530 --> 03:20.225
Sure.

03:28.607 --> 03:31.303
It happened again, didn't it?

03:31.476 --> 03:34.274
Jordan, I know how much
you want this to work...

03:34.446 --> 03:36.937
...but I still think it's a mistake.

03:44.056 --> 03:47.025
No. Not today.

03:49.861 --> 03:52.125
-Don't be today.
-Jordan.

03:57.969 --> 04:01.063
-Mr. Altman? Are you okay?
-Why did you stop me?

04:02.741 --> 04:05.403
I just wanted to be with my little girl.

04:06.578 --> 04:10.070
My daughter is dead, and it is my fault.

05:23.522 --> 05:27.788
Megan, could you go and ask the nurse
if Mr. Altman's ready for visitors?

05:30.929 --> 05:32.294
How's Mr. Altman?

05:32.464 --> 05:34.091
He's pretty heavily sedated.

05:34.266 --> 05:37.963
They want to keep him here
until they can do a full psych evaluation.

05:38.870 --> 05:42.306
I didn't know you and Megan
knew Mr. Altman so well.

05:43.809 --> 05:45.367
It's really through his daughter.

05:45.544 --> 05:48.570
We were all in the cheerleading squad
back in junior high.

05:49.147 --> 05:51.741
Mr. Altman was never the same
after she got hurt.

05:51.917 --> 05:56.251
-I remember she was hit by a car.
-Walking home from our end-of-season party.

05:56.755 --> 06:00.748
The doctors said there was
no chance for recovery....

06:00.926 --> 06:03.827
But Mr. Altman
kept hoping for a miracle.

06:04.896 --> 06:06.761
It sounds like that never came.

06:07.566 --> 06:10.296
He took her off life support last month.

06:11.403 --> 06:13.803
I wouldn't wish that decision on anyone.

06:18.910 --> 06:22.311
It's hard when you blame yourself
for everything that happened.

06:25.150 --> 06:27.141
I'd better go.

06:34.893 --> 06:38.329
If I could change that night, I would.

06:39.998 --> 06:43.798
I don't even remember
why Julia and I were fighting.

06:44.903 --> 06:46.632
Megan, don't do this.

06:48.273 --> 06:51.868
Julia left that night
because she was mad at me.

06:54.212 --> 06:56.180
If I had just stopped her....

06:56.448 --> 06:58.643
I wish I'd gone after her too, but....

06:58.817 --> 07:02.617
You know, neither of us could have known
what was going to happen.

07:02.787 --> 07:05.551
You can't keep blaming yourself.

07:06.858 --> 07:09.554
I should've told him then.

07:10.896 --> 07:13.421
He's under sedation.

07:13.798 --> 07:16.392
I'm not sure he's even hearing you.

07:20.071 --> 07:23.006
Come on. Let's go.

07:24.576 --> 07:27.272
I'm so sorry.

08:19.965 --> 08:21.694
Hey, Jordan, it's just me.

08:22.901 --> 08:24.425
Yeah. Hi.

08:24.603 --> 08:27.128
I'm sorry for dropping
the mentor ball yesterday.

08:27.305 --> 08:29.603
Mr. Altman's lucky you were there.

08:29.774 --> 08:31.605
I just wish my dad hadn't seen it.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.774
Just tell him that Smallville High
is rarely that exciting.

08:35.947 --> 08:40.077
Trust me, my parents wrote the book
on being overprotective. You'll be fine.

08:41.019 --> 08:44.546
-You all right?
-Yeah. I just don't like being touched.

08:45.123 --> 08:46.750
Fair enough.

09:00.372 --> 09:01.964
What?

09:02.140 --> 09:05.667
Nothing. You just had
that look yesterday...

09:05.844 --> 09:09.371
...just before Mr. Altman
jumped in front of the car.

09:09.981 --> 09:13.178
It's almost like you knew
he was gonna do something.

09:13.351 --> 09:15.182
I need some air.

09:30.869 --> 09:33.531
-Good night.
-Bye, Lana.

09:38.076 --> 09:39.509
Get it off me!

09:39.711 --> 09:41.178
It burns!

09:49.788 --> 09:52.313
Get it off!

09:55.393 --> 09:58.123
It hurts! It burns!

09:59.230 --> 10:01.391
Adam, are you all right?

10:02.133 --> 10:03.896
Adam, wake up.

10:04.135 --> 10:06.000
Get off!

10:12.077 --> 10:14.238
Lana.

10:14.979 --> 10:17.470
What happened? Are you okay?

10:17.649 --> 10:19.776
I'm fine.

10:19.951 --> 10:22.943
You were having a king-sized nightmare.

10:24.089 --> 10:26.250
I guess.

10:29.961 --> 10:32.794
Do you want to talk about it?

10:33.998 --> 10:36.558
To be honest, no, not really.

10:42.707 --> 10:47.644
I'll put some clothes on,
clean up this mess.

10:53.151 --> 10:56.245
Clark, we've been looking
all over for you.

10:56.421 --> 10:58.548
-Who gets to do the honors?
-What's going on?

10:58.723 --> 11:01.317
Ready to hear the latest news
about Lana's houseguest?

11:01.493 --> 11:03.654
Actually, no.

11:04.295 --> 11:06.354
"No" as in you're not interested?

11:06.531 --> 11:09.091
No. "No" as in it's none of my business.

11:09.267 --> 11:12.862
Lana and I finally reset
our relationship to the friendship level.

11:13.037 --> 11:16.063
I'm not gonna blow it
by getting between her and Adam.

11:18.409 --> 11:20.809
Clark's taking one for the team.

11:20.979 --> 11:23.311
From now on, consider me
an Adam-free zone.

11:23.548 --> 11:26.779
Okay. Now that we can
scratch gossip off the discussion list...

11:26.951 --> 11:28.384
...what's next on the agenda?

11:30.822 --> 11:34.053
What have you guys heard
about that new kid, Jordan Cross?

11:34.359 --> 11:37.226
You mean,
Mr. Pathologically-Afraid-of-Human-Contact?

11:38.096 --> 11:42.089
I guess he made quite a first impression.
Look, this is gonna sound crazy...

11:42.267 --> 11:45.065
...but I think he had a premonition
about Mr. Altman.

11:45.236 --> 11:46.601
What made you take that leap?

11:48.039 --> 11:49.404
Let's call it a gut feeling.

11:49.574 --> 11:52.372
-Maybe that's the same thing Jordan had.
-What do you mean?

11:52.544 --> 11:55.513
Some people believe premonitions
are just heightened intuition.

11:55.680 --> 11:59.013
Maybe he overheard something
or saw a look in Altman's eyes.

11:59.184 --> 12:02.779
But given your past with Wall of Weirdness,
we should look into it.

12:04.389 --> 12:06.084
-Thanks.
-No thanks required.

12:06.257 --> 12:09.886
It's kind of fun being Woodward
to your Bernstein again.

12:17.936 --> 12:21.269
-Lana, come in.
-Your message said it was important.

12:21.439 --> 12:24.533
-ls something wrong?
-I was hoping you could tell me.

12:25.443 --> 12:28.435
I understand there was an incident
at the Talon last night.

12:29.214 --> 12:31.682
Apparently some neighbors
heard your tenant screaming?

12:33.585 --> 12:36.952
I think that "incident"
is a pretty strong word.

12:37.789 --> 12:40.519
Adam had a bad dream, that's all.
It's no big deal.

12:40.692 --> 12:43.786
If it had been the first time,
I'd probably agree with you.

12:43.962 --> 12:46.362
-What do you mean?
-I can read an invoice.

12:48.733 --> 12:50.394
Let's see.

12:50.568 --> 12:53.969
Charges for repairing broken windows...

12:54.138 --> 12:56.333
...replacing furniture...

12:56.507 --> 13:00.273
...all in the last week.
Is there a reason why you didn't tell me?

13:00.445 --> 13:02.470
Maybe I thought
you'd jump to conclusions.

13:02.647 --> 13:04.842
You have to admit,
Adam's behavior is unusual.

13:09.721 --> 13:13.851
And when you're on the rebound, your
emotions can outweigh your common sense.

13:14.025 --> 13:16.493
Look, this isn't personal.

13:16.661 --> 13:18.720
Adam's been a real help
around the Talon.

13:18.897 --> 13:22.560
Putting up with a few nightmares
is a small price to pay.

13:24.335 --> 13:26.565
Look, it's your call...

13:26.738 --> 13:30.105
...but at the very least,
you should be asking yourself...

13:30.275 --> 13:32.766
...how much do you really know
about your new friend?

14:31.469 --> 14:33.300
Chloe, I think I found something.

14:33.471 --> 14:35.837
Yeah? You and me both.

14:36.007 --> 14:39.340
I just had a mega-Real World
moment with Ad--

14:39.510 --> 14:41.910
Never mind. Sorry.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.880
Anyway, looks like you're hammering away
at the Jordan story.

14:46.050 --> 14:48.211
Yes. I pulled this off the Ledger database.

14:48.386 --> 14:49.910
Apparently when Jordan was six...

14:50.088 --> 14:53.922
...he went ballistic outside a roller coaster,
screaming someone was gonna be killed.

14:54.092 --> 14:57.960
He dad pulled him away, but when they
started the ride, one of the cars broke loose.

14:58.129 --> 15:01.189
Killing the woman
standing in line with him.

15:01.366 --> 15:04.529
Mr. Altman wasn't
Jordan's first premonition.

15:04.702 --> 15:07.034
All right, well, cue the spooky music...

15:07.205 --> 15:10.140
...because Jordan was born
on the day of the meteor shower.

15:10.942 --> 15:15.311
I took a quick trip to the courthouse and
asked them to pull anything about Cross.

15:15.480 --> 15:19.416
According to this, Jordan's mother
died shortly after he was born...

15:19.584 --> 15:22.747
...as a result of a direct hit
from a meteor?

15:22.920 --> 15:25.889
As one life ends, another begins.

15:26.224 --> 15:28.192
Well, that must be the connection.

15:28.359 --> 15:32.056
Yeah. Mix that with meteor rocks,
and you could be in John Edward territory.

15:33.765 --> 15:37.064
-No, get away from me.
-Megan, please.

15:37.602 --> 15:39.934
-This can't be good.
-Listen to me for one second.

15:40.104 --> 15:41.435
Megan, please!

15:41.606 --> 15:42.903
That's Jordan.

15:43.274 --> 15:44.866
-Stop it!
-You don't understand!

15:45.043 --> 15:46.374
-I'm trying to help you!
-Go away!

15:46.544 --> 15:47.909
Megan, stop!

15:48.079 --> 15:51.048
Please, I'm just asking you
to let me walk you home.

15:51.349 --> 15:53.943
You don't understand!
It's not what you think!

15:54.185 --> 15:56.153
Leave me alone!

15:57.221 --> 15:58.950
-What's going on?
-I have to help her!

15:59.123 --> 16:01.057
Why? Calm down!
What'll happen to her?

16:01.292 --> 16:03.351
She's going to die, Clark.

16:03.961 --> 16:05.360
Don't you understand?

16:06.197 --> 16:08.495
She's going to die.

16:26.651 --> 16:29.017
Jordan, hold up!

16:29.520 --> 16:31.784
My father was right, Clark.

16:31.956 --> 16:33.082
This was a mistake.

16:33.324 --> 16:35.485
I should've never come to school.

16:35.660 --> 16:37.150
Jordan...

16:37.328 --> 16:38.386
...I believe you.

16:38.863 --> 16:42.060
You saw something when you
touched Megan, didn't you?

16:42.233 --> 16:45.031
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Like a premonition?

16:45.203 --> 16:47.000
I don't know what you're talking about!

16:47.171 --> 16:49.366
I know about the roller coaster.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.008
When you touched Megan,
what'd you see?

16:55.713 --> 16:57.544
I saw fire.

16:57.715 --> 16:59.376
Smoke.

16:59.550 --> 17:01.108
Megan was screaming.

17:01.619 --> 17:03.416
She couldn't breathe.

17:04.188 --> 17:06.088
Clark, I had to warn her.

17:10.228 --> 17:11.422
Maybe we still can.

17:13.564 --> 17:16.556
Megan's house is just around the corner.

17:17.734 --> 17:20.431
These visions, when they hit,
what are they like?

17:20.805 --> 17:23.272
It's hard to describe.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.406
It's like a curtain's being pulled back...

17:26.577 --> 17:29.876
...just long enough for me
to see the moment they die.

17:31.983 --> 17:34.975
Have you ever been able to stop
a vision from coming true?

17:35.153 --> 17:36.677
Never.

17:36.854 --> 17:40.915
My dad and I did everything we could.
We called the police, the paramedics...

17:41.092 --> 17:43.788
...begged people to take us seriously.

17:43.961 --> 17:46.589
But no matter what we did,
the visions always came true.

17:46.764 --> 17:50.131
That's how you knew
Mr. Altman was gonna kill himself.

17:50.301 --> 17:51.825
Except he survived.

17:52.303 --> 17:54.271
Because of you.

17:54.505 --> 17:56.905
How did you do it?

17:57.441 --> 18:01.207
I had a vision of you too,
when you grabbed me in the hallway.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.609
What do you mean? What'd you see?

18:05.082 --> 18:07.642
Like, you don't have an end
like other people.

18:07.818 --> 18:10.514
It's like you live forever.

18:12.757 --> 18:14.816
Come on, Jordan, you're wrong.

18:15.393 --> 18:16.792
No.

18:16.961 --> 18:19.589
Maybe that's why you were able
to save Mr. Altman.

18:19.764 --> 18:22.961
Nobody's ever been able to stop
one of the deaths before.

18:23.134 --> 18:25.830
Maybe you can do it again for Megan.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.401
Excuse me.

18:32.810 --> 18:34.209
Mr. Kent.

18:34.378 --> 18:35.777
Why am I not surprised?

18:35.947 --> 18:39.178
-Sheriff, what's happening?
-We just found Megan Calder's car...

18:39.350 --> 18:41.045
...abandoned off the main highway.

18:41.852 --> 18:43.342
There were signs of a struggle.

18:45.122 --> 18:46.180
Are you Jordan Cross?

18:49.527 --> 18:52.690
I'm told you got into an argument
with Miss Calder today.

18:54.198 --> 18:58.567
-I was there, sheriff. It wasn't a big deal.
-I got a missing girl, Mr. Kent.

18:58.736 --> 19:00.363
That makes everything a big deal.

19:03.708 --> 19:04.970
We'd better talk.

19:16.354 --> 19:19.050
It's a little early for your second
triple cap, isn't it?

19:19.223 --> 19:21.953
Actually, I came to talk
to you about something.

19:22.126 --> 19:26.222
-ls Adam around?
-I don't know. I haven't seen him in a while.

19:26.397 --> 19:28.262
You okay?

19:29.300 --> 19:33.236
Well, I'm just having one of those
"it sucks to be a reporter" days.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.936
I know you and Adam have been spending
a lot of time together, but....

19:41.946 --> 19:43.607
Chloe, what's wrong?

19:53.724 --> 19:58.855
They say music hath charms
to soothe the savage breast.

19:59.163 --> 20:01.529
Don't count on it.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.965
You play?

20:05.136 --> 20:07.366
I never really had the patience for it.

20:07.538 --> 20:11.338
My parents would have killed
for a piano like this.

20:13.477 --> 20:16.275
I wound up learning
on a second-hand junker.

20:16.447 --> 20:19.382
It doesn't seem to have hurt your playing.

20:19.550 --> 20:23.577
It's one of Rachmaninoff's
most complicated pieces.

20:24.188 --> 20:26.713
You didn't ask me here
to discuss music theory.

20:27.725 --> 20:29.590
No.

20:30.328 --> 20:31.727
I thought we should meet.

20:32.330 --> 20:36.892
-lf it's about the lamp, I'll replace it.
-It's your behavior that concerns me, Adam.

20:39.303 --> 20:41.601
-Lana's a friend.
-For what it's worth...

20:41.772 --> 20:43.603
...we both care about Lana.

20:46.711 --> 20:50.238
-What's this?
-Your colorful past.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.745
These are my school records.

20:54.919 --> 20:58.218
-They're supposed to be sealed.
-I'm not sure why you'd care.

20:58.389 --> 20:59.913
They're exemplary.

21:00.091 --> 21:02.753
Straight A's across the board.

21:03.227 --> 21:07.220
-I was always a good student.
-Actually, I spoke with your teachers.

21:07.398 --> 21:10.094
I believe the phrases they used were...

21:10.267 --> 21:14.567
..."a fine pupil" and "a joy to teach."

21:14.739 --> 21:16.832
It's nice to be appreciated.

21:17.007 --> 21:19.339
The strange thing is...

21:19.844 --> 21:21.709
...they all said it.

21:21.879 --> 21:24.973
Word for word. Almost as if
they were told what to say.

21:29.453 --> 21:31.512
Don't worry, Adam.

21:31.689 --> 21:32.781
I'll keep checking.

21:35.092 --> 21:38.653
We all have black marks
somewhere in our past.

21:49.940 --> 21:51.669
Jordan.

21:53.677 --> 21:55.042
Are you all right?

21:55.212 --> 21:56.474
I had another vision.

21:56.947 --> 21:58.847
I thought I could help.

21:59.016 --> 22:01.177
It's okay. Clark knows.

22:02.753 --> 22:05.051
-Wait for me in the truck.
-Dad, please.

22:06.791 --> 22:08.691
Jordan.

22:11.729 --> 22:13.026
Excuse me.

22:13.197 --> 22:14.755
Mr. Cross.

22:15.232 --> 22:18.201
Jordan really wants
to make a go of it at school.

22:18.369 --> 22:22.328
-Would you give him one more chance?
-I really appreciate all you've done, Clark...

22:22.506 --> 22:24.531
...but Jordan is...

22:24.708 --> 22:28.610
...special. If he's at home,
at least I can try to protect him.

22:29.180 --> 22:30.875
Jordan.

22:31.115 --> 22:33.879
Oh, my God. Jordan!

22:36.821 --> 22:38.812
Jordan!

22:43.894 --> 22:45.919
I got your message.

22:46.230 --> 22:48.460
In case, you didn't notice, school's out.

22:48.632 --> 22:51.294
I was at the Torch doing some research.

22:54.638 --> 22:57.198
Adam, there's no easy way to ask this...

22:57.374 --> 23:01.037
...but somebody found your needle
in the trash today.

23:01.212 --> 23:02.975
Technically, that's not a question.

23:03.147 --> 23:06.344
Look, I'm trying to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

23:06.517 --> 23:08.451
Are you diabetic?

23:08.619 --> 23:10.086
On some sort of medication?

23:10.287 --> 23:13.723
Was that the research you were doing?
That would explain it...

23:13.891 --> 23:17.224
...except diabetics leave their syringes
with the school nurse.

23:17.394 --> 23:20.659
Believe me, I am not trying
to accuse you of anything.

23:20.865 --> 23:23.459
Yes, you are. You think I'm on drugs.

23:23.901 --> 23:25.835
The truth is, you don't trust me.

23:26.003 --> 23:27.766
Never have.

23:27.938 --> 23:29.405
That's not fair.

23:29.573 --> 23:32.337
You said you'd always be honest
with me. Why not now?

23:32.510 --> 23:36.810
Look, I want this to work,
but if you're not sure, just say the word.

23:36.981 --> 23:38.608
I'm gone.

23:58.068 --> 24:00.059
Adam!

24:04.875 --> 24:06.604
Jordan.

24:06.777 --> 24:09.439
-Are you okay?
-Fine.

24:09.980 --> 24:13.677
-What are you doing here?
-Hiding from my father.

24:13.851 --> 24:16.820
I think he wants to pull me out of school.

24:17.254 --> 24:19.381
Running away isn't going to fix things--

24:38.609 --> 24:39.701
It's changed.

24:41.378 --> 24:44.711
-Jordan, what is it?
-Lana, please, don't leave here.

24:44.915 --> 24:46.712
-What's going on?
-I can't explain it.

24:46.884 --> 24:50.251
Something awful's about to happen.
We have to go find Clark!

24:50.487 --> 24:52.045
Clark? Wait--

24:52.222 --> 24:53.814
What are you doing?

25:15.012 --> 25:16.946
Adam?

25:19.283 --> 25:21.217
Hello?

25:59.023 --> 26:02.550
Last I heard, breaking and entering
was still against the law.

26:03.060 --> 26:05.460
I could say the same thing to you.

26:05.629 --> 26:07.927
Except I own the place.

26:09.466 --> 26:12.094
I take it you have some concerns
about Lana's new friend?

26:12.269 --> 26:14.965
I think that's pretty obvious.

26:15.539 --> 26:18.099
So what caused you to go
all cloak and dagger?

26:19.743 --> 26:22.268
Rachmaninoff.

26:22.446 --> 26:26.712
When Adam came to see me today, he was
playing one of his most difficult pieces.

26:26.884 --> 26:28.818
Is that a crime?

26:28.986 --> 26:31.784
No CDs, sheet music...

26:31.955 --> 26:34.116
...not even a radio.

26:35.693 --> 26:39.652
According to his transcripts,
he never took a single music class.

26:39.830 --> 26:44.199
So computers, kickboxing
and a master pianist.

26:45.169 --> 26:47.034
Adam's a regular Renaissance man.

26:47.638 --> 26:49.765
Like you said, that isn't a crime.

26:50.307 --> 26:52.798
Though it certainly piqued your interest.

26:55.345 --> 26:57.074
Lock up on your way out.

27:18.502 --> 27:20.265
Clark!

27:20.437 --> 27:24.464
Clark, you've been looking for Jordan
all over town. Time to call it a night.

27:24.641 --> 27:26.370
I was supposed to help him fit in.

27:26.543 --> 27:29.444
I took him to a crime scene.
I put him on the sheriff's radar.

27:29.613 --> 27:33.105
-That is not your fault.
-Well, he was better off before he met me.

27:33.283 --> 27:38.118
Clark, if he ran away, it's because he didn't
feel like he had anybody at home to talk to.

27:38.489 --> 27:41.652
-His dad seemed like a good man.
-I'm sure he is.

27:41.825 --> 27:45.784
And I'm also sure he feels like
he's doing the best thing for Jordan.

27:48.198 --> 27:49.825
Look, when--

27:50.000 --> 27:52.764
When your son has a gift...

27:54.638 --> 27:58.199
...your first temptation is to hide him away,
to shelter him from everything.

27:58.375 --> 28:00.400
You didn't.

28:01.578 --> 28:03.375
I sure as hell wanted to.

28:03.847 --> 28:08.216
Look, your mother convinced me
you needed to experience the whole world...

28:08.385 --> 28:11.843
...not just this farm.

28:12.623 --> 28:15.114
Ultimately, she was right.

28:18.162 --> 28:20.756
So Jordan will come home...

28:20.931 --> 28:22.660
...but not until he's good and ready.

28:24.568 --> 28:26.035
-Okay?
-Yeah.

28:27.671 --> 28:30.902
All right, why don't you come on inside,
grab a bite to eat.

28:31.074 --> 28:33.338
I'll be there in a second.

28:33.510 --> 28:35.205
Okay.

28:48.759 --> 28:51.159
-Clark.
-Jordan, what happened to you?

28:51.328 --> 28:54.661
I was in school with Lana when somebody
attacked us. They took her!

28:54.832 --> 28:58.165
-Who took her?
-I don't know! I didn't see him.

28:58.635 --> 29:00.569
Clark, I had another vision of Lana.

29:00.737 --> 29:03.604
-What do you mean, "another"?
-I'm not sure.

29:03.774 --> 29:07.437
The other day, she touched my hand
on the track. It was okay.

29:08.145 --> 29:11.410
She was peaceful. She was old.
It was her time.

29:11.615 --> 29:15.278
-You're saying that's changed?
-She was trapped in a fire, just like Megan!

29:15.452 --> 29:17.886
Okay, okay, calm down.
What else did you see?

29:19.022 --> 29:23.220
Stuff on the floor, photos burning.

29:23.627 --> 29:28.030
Lana and Megan were in one, but they were
younger. They were in cheerleading outfits.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.532
Is this the girl?

29:33.704 --> 29:34.796
Mr. Altman's daughter.

29:37.741 --> 29:40.403
When I saved him, I changed everything...

29:40.577 --> 29:43.375
...even what's supposed
to happen to Lana.

29:44.014 --> 29:47.108
Did you see anything
that might tell us where she is?

29:47.284 --> 29:49.878
-There was an old sign inside.
-What did it say?

29:50.420 --> 29:53.981
-lt said "Wandering Hills."
-I know where that is.

29:54.358 --> 29:55.916
-Clark, take me with you.
-No way.

29:56.093 --> 30:00.427
I've seen the house.
Maybe I can help you find it. Please.

30:02.299 --> 30:04.699
First sign of trouble, you back off.

30:04.868 --> 30:06.335
Let's go.

30:11.608 --> 30:14.509
Mr. Altman, why are you doing this?

30:15.345 --> 30:17.176
Please, you don't have to do this!

30:17.581 --> 30:21.813
-You're gonna pay for what you did to Julia.
-What are you talking about?

30:22.719 --> 30:25.711
I heard you at the hospital.
Megan had a fight with her...

30:25.889 --> 30:28.915
...and you let her leave.
You should have looked out for her.

30:29.092 --> 30:31.959
-We didn't cause the accident.
-You might as well have.

30:32.129 --> 30:34.620
My little girl was out there
all alone because of you!

30:34.865 --> 30:36.765
It wasn't our fault!

30:36.934 --> 30:39.494
For years, I blamed myself
for not being there--

30:39.670 --> 30:41.570
Coach, this is not the way.

30:41.872 --> 30:45.239
Now I know I wasn't responsible.

30:45.909 --> 30:48.707
-You two killed her.
-No, we di--

30:53.450 --> 30:55.645
-Please!
-No. No!

30:56.453 --> 30:58.978
Coach, don't! No!

31:10.033 --> 31:11.796
Help!

31:17.407 --> 31:19.568
Help us!

31:21.244 --> 31:23.144
Please!

31:39.062 --> 31:40.859
Clark, look!

31:42.165 --> 31:45.362
-Jordan, stay in the car.
-He's got them both. You'll need help.

31:45.535 --> 31:47.264
Stay in the car, Jordan.

31:58.448 --> 32:00.177
Lana?

32:00.350 --> 32:02.011
-Lana.
-Save Megan.

32:02.252 --> 32:03.844
Get out.

32:11.862 --> 32:13.352
Jordan!

32:13.997 --> 32:16.158
I'll get Megan.

32:18.468 --> 32:20.698
You stay away from me!

32:20.904 --> 32:23.065
-I just want to be with my girl!
-Come on.

32:23.607 --> 32:25.131
Come on, let's go.

32:25.776 --> 32:28.438
Coach? You've gotta get out of here!

32:33.050 --> 32:36.315
You! It's your fault!

32:41.258 --> 32:43.783
-Where's Jordan?
-I didn't see him come out with us.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.598
-Clark!
-Run!

32:55.238 --> 32:57.001
Jordan!

32:59.943 --> 33:01.501
Mr. Altman!

33:01.878 --> 33:04.005
Coach Altman!

33:04.948 --> 33:07.246
You've gotta get out of here!

33:43.720 --> 33:45.585
Jordan.

33:46.123 --> 33:48.284
Clark. Clark, are you okay?

33:48.492 --> 33:51.017
-Oh, my God. Is he okay?
-He's not breathing.

33:51.194 --> 33:52.456
Jordan.

33:52.796 --> 33:54.457
Come on, Jordan.

33:54.631 --> 33:56.292
You can't die on me.

34:05.509 --> 34:06.908
Clark.

34:07.077 --> 34:08.806
It's okay. You're all right.

34:18.388 --> 34:20.719
You're gonna be okay.

34:27.097 --> 34:29.496
-Lex?
-Lana.

34:29.666 --> 34:30.724
How you feeling?

34:31.701 --> 34:36.502
Between the fire and my leg, I've seen
enough hospitals to last a lifetime.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.536
-Have a seat.
-Thanks.

34:42.879 --> 34:46.280
Lex, I think you were right
about taking a closer look at Adam.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.612
Why the sudden change of heart?

34:50.420 --> 34:54.219
Chloe caught him using
some sort of drug at school...

34:54.391 --> 34:58.418
...and when I confronted him about it,
he almost lost it.

34:58.595 --> 35:02.622
Lana, I've had people assume
the worst about me all my life.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.801
Trust me, it's hard to respond...

35:06.970 --> 35:10.565
...when people always jump
to the wrong conclusions.

35:12.242 --> 35:14.836
Lex, the last time we talked,
I got the impression...

35:15.011 --> 35:17.741
...that you'd be happier
if I kicked him out.

35:18.114 --> 35:19.809
It's not my choice to make...

35:20.817 --> 35:23.650
...but I've had a chance
to ask a few questions.

35:24.521 --> 35:27.752
Adam hasn't been healing
as well as his doctors had hoped.

35:28.658 --> 35:32.617
Apparently, he's part of a clinical
medical trial testing a new drug.

35:34.397 --> 35:37.093
That might explain the needle.

35:37.267 --> 35:39.565
It doesn't explain why he was hiding it.

35:42.772 --> 35:46.833
I'm just beginning to wonder
who I let into my life.

35:50.013 --> 35:52.243
You should trust your instincts.

35:56.086 --> 35:58.316
Thanks, Lex.

36:18.074 --> 36:20.872
I promise your second week
of school will be easier.

36:21.044 --> 36:24.502
The paramedics said if you
hadn't given me CPR, I'd be...

36:24.681 --> 36:27.673
-...dead.
-But you're not.

36:29.286 --> 36:30.844
I saw her, Clark.

36:31.421 --> 36:33.184
-Who?
-My mom.

36:33.657 --> 36:36.751
In that moment,
right before you pulled me back.

36:37.127 --> 36:38.492
She was beautiful.

36:39.562 --> 36:41.496
I tried to run to her but couldn't.

36:42.299 --> 36:43.732
Maybe it just wasn't your time.

36:44.367 --> 36:45.994
When I woke up, they were gone.

36:46.770 --> 36:48.328
The visions?

36:48.505 --> 36:51.872
Maybe I was destined
to lose them when I met you.

36:52.409 --> 36:56.209
Mind if I interrupt?
Jordan, I brought your homework.

36:59.282 --> 37:01.750
Why do I get the feeling
you've got a new mentor?

37:01.918 --> 37:06.981
I'm gonna help Jordan get back on his feet,
and he's gonna help me get faster on mine.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.824
I think you're getting the hang
of this high school thing.

37:16.633 --> 37:18.692
How you doing?

37:20.303 --> 37:21.702
I know that look.

37:21.871 --> 37:23.668
Are you sure you're okay?

37:25.342 --> 37:27.401
Yeah, I'm fine, Clark.

37:29.546 --> 37:31.514
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:35.518 --> 37:38.282
So we've got a lot of work to do.

37:49.666 --> 37:51.657
What's wrong?

37:54.170 --> 37:56.502
Lana, it's about your friend...

37:56.673 --> 37:59.107
...the one in the hall? Adam.

38:02.245 --> 38:04.110
He's from Oklahoma, right?

38:04.280 --> 38:06.748
I don't know.
He's never really said anything.

38:07.117 --> 38:09.085
Jordan, what's going on?

38:11.688 --> 38:13.747
I think something really bad
happened to him.

38:14.524 --> 38:16.617
Well, he's been in the hospital.

38:16.793 --> 38:19.261
He was pretty seriously injured
a few months ago.

38:22.632 --> 38:25.362
This is going to sound really strange...

38:27.137 --> 38:28.832
...but I think it's worse than that.

38:30.407 --> 38:32.637
I don't think he was just hurt.

38:33.576 --> 38:35.510
I think he died.

38:46.556 --> 38:48.786
You're awfully quiet today.

38:50.360 --> 38:53.591
Having someone tell you
you can change destiny is a lot to handle.

38:53.763 --> 38:57.062
Jordan's visions really struck a chord.

38:57.233 --> 39:00.669
Or just brought up questions
I had all along.

39:02.138 --> 39:05.938
Mom, by helping Mr. Altman,
I put three other lives in jeopardy.

39:06.109 --> 39:08.407
But you were there for them.

39:09.212 --> 39:11.840
If it wasn't for me,
he wouldn't have hurt anyone.

39:12.015 --> 39:13.949
Clark, what's this really about?

39:15.819 --> 39:18.686
I'm wondering if that's why
I was really sent here...

39:18.855 --> 39:21.153
...to change destiny.

39:21.324 --> 39:25.260
What if I make a wrong choice,
and I'm not there to make it right?

39:25.862 --> 39:27.557
It's a huge responsibility.

39:27.864 --> 39:29.832
You have to concentrate
on the good you do.

39:29.999 --> 39:34.231
Think of all the people you've saved,
your dad, and me and Lex.

39:34.404 --> 39:36.565
He's turned out to be a really good friend.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.975
Sweetheart, you just have to do
the best you can.

39:40.143 --> 39:42.168
You can't save everybody.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.639
I'll take some of these
out to your dad.

39:45.815 --> 39:48.113
I'll do it.

39:49.285 --> 39:53.244
Well, could you please make sure at least
a couple of them make it to the barn?

39:53.456 --> 39:55.287
-Yes.
-Thank you.

39:56.326 --> 39:58.157
Thanks, Mom.

40:10.273 --> 40:12.070
Dad!

40:31.628 --> 40:34.392
Dad. Dad!

40:35.732 --> 40:38.394
-Dad?
-Not now.

40:39.002 --> 40:40.765
Not yet.

40:41.070 --> 40:43.004
I love you, son.

40:48.378 --> 40:50.107
Dad?

40:51.381 --> 40:52.473
Mom!

40:54.584 --> 40:56.279
Mom!

40:58.421 --> 41:00.787
Mom!

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
