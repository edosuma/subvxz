09:08.233 --> 09:09.667
-JUST ON MY WAY HOME.

09:09.767 --> 09:11.133
-ON YOUR WAY HOME?
-YEAH.

09:11.233 --> 09:12.800
-OKAY. WHO IS THIS GUY TO YOU?

09:12.900 --> 09:14.100
-HE'S JUST A FRIEND.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.233
-JUST A FRIEND?

09:15.333 --> 09:18.667
WHY IS HE TAKING OFF,
RUNNING FROM THE POLICE?

09:18.767 --> 09:19.800
-I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.067
-YOU DON'T KNOW?

09:21.100 --> 09:23.067
OKAY. IS THERE ANYTHING
IN THE CAR?

09:23.100 --> 09:24.433
-NOT THAT I KNOW OF.
-OKAY.

09:24.533 --> 09:26.800
YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN
YOUR PURSE WE NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.333
-I HAVE A PIPE.

09:28.433 --> 09:29.367
-WHAT KIND OF PIPE?

09:29.467 --> 09:31.067
-A METH PIPE.
-METH PIPE.

09:31.133 --> 09:32.333
ANY METH IN THERE?

09:32.433 --> 09:34.300
-NO.
-ANY METH IN YOUR PURSE
OR ANYWHERE?

09:34.400 --> 09:35.600
-UH-UH.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.233
-YOU SURE?

09:37.333 --> 09:38.933
'CAUSE AGAIN, YOU DON'T SEEM
VERY CONFIDENT IN THAT ANSWER.
-I'M SURE.

09:39.067 --> 09:42.300
-OKAY. SO, HE WASN'T RUNNING
SO YOU COULD HIDE THE METH
SOMEWHERE ON YOU?

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
-NO.
-'CAUSE WE COULD TAKE YOU
TO JAIL AND HAVE YOU SEARCHED

09:44.500 --> 09:45.900
AND THEN--
-YOU CAN SEARCH ME!

09:46.067 --> 09:47.633
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING!
-OKAY, I'M JUST ASKING YOU
A QUESTION.

09:47.733 --> 09:49.100
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.600
HANG OUT FOR
A SECOND, ALL RIGHT?

09:55.367 --> 09:56.900
HEY, UH, DELA PENA,

09:57.067 --> 09:58.900
CHECK THIS LITTLE
HATCH RIGHT HERE.

09:59.067 --> 10:00.367
-I DID.
-THERE NOTHING
IN THERE?

10:02.133 --> 10:03.633
-HEY, ARCH?
-WHAT'S UP?

10:03.733 --> 10:05.300
-WHAT'S THAT?
-DOWN THERE?

10:05.400 --> 10:07.567
-THIS-- OH, YEAH.
-THAT BAGGY.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.367
-OOH!
-JEEZ!

10:12.433 --> 10:16.067
-THAT'S A HUGE CHUNK OF CRYSTAL.
-THAT'S A BIG OL' ROCK.

10:16.167 --> 10:17.900
THIS CAME OUT
OF HER PURSE

10:18.000 --> 10:19.233
WITH THE LITTLE BAG OF WEED.

10:19.333 --> 10:20.700
-PRETTY GOOD SIZED CHUNK.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.133
THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF
THE LARGEST SINGLE PIECES
I'VE EVER SEEN.

10:24.233 --> 10:27.067
USUALLY, WE SEE IT,
BASICALLY, LIKE, LITTLE
CRYSTALLIZED POWDER.

10:27.167 --> 10:30.233
USUALLY NOT IN ONE,
JUST, BIG SOLID CHUNK
LIKE THAT.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.967
LET ME TALK TO HER
REAL QUICK.

10:32.067 --> 10:34.567
-THIS IS BULL (bleep)

10:36.267 --> 10:37.800
-HEY, THIS IS THE DEAL, OKAY?

10:37.900 --> 10:39.533
-WHAT? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

10:39.633 --> 10:41.300
-OKAY.
-WHY AM I GOING
TO JAIL?

10:41.400 --> 10:44.400
-WHY DO YOU-- YOU HAVE
A HUGE BAG. OKAY? YOU HAVE
SOME WEED IN YOUR PURSE. OKAY?

10:44.500 --> 10:46.067
YOU GOT YOUR METH PIPE.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.700
THEN THERE'S THIS...

10:47.800 --> 10:49.433
-THE PIPE IS MINE,
THAT'S IT.

10:49.533 --> 10:52.567
-THEN THERE'S A HUGE CHUNK
OF METHAMPHETAMINE SITTING--

10:52.667 --> 10:54.367
-IT'S NOT MINE.
-HOLD ON, LET ME FINISH.

10:54.467 --> 10:57.700
SITTING RIGHT, BASICALLY,
IN THE DOOR JAM
NEXT TO YOU.

10:57.800 --> 10:58.967
RIGHT WHERE YOU
WERE SITTING.

10:59.067 --> 11:00.900
-IT'S NOT MINE.
-BUT IT'S SITTING
WHERE YOU ARE.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.067
SO, YOU'RE THE ONE
TAKING IT. THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.633
YOU'RE ASKING WHY YOU'RE GOING
TO JAIL, SO I'M TELLING YOU.
-BUT IT'S NOT MINE!

11:05.733 --> 11:07.300
-OKAY. SO...

11:07.400 --> 11:09.600
I'LL MAKE SURE AND NOTE IT
IN THE REPORT THAT YOU SAID
IT'S NOT YOURS.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.167
-PLEASE?
-OKAY.

11:11.267 --> 11:13.067
ALL RIGHT.
-IT'S NOT MINE.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.200
-OKAY.
-I SWEAR.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.467
-ALL RIGHT.
-I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO BE GOOD.

11:15.567 --> 11:16.667
-YOU BEEN TRYING
TO BE GOOD?

11:16.767 --> 11:18.167
-YES.
-BUT YOU'RE SMOKING
METH STILL?

11:18.267 --> 11:20.133
HOW IS SMOKING METH BEING GOOD?
-I'M OUT ON WORK PROJECTS.

11:20.233 --> 11:21.967
-YOU'RE OUT ON WORK PROJECTS
SMOKING METH?

11:23.367 --> 11:25.133
RIGHT?
-SIR, I'M TRYING.

11:25.233 --> 11:27.300
-OKAY. I THINK YOU NEED
TO TRY A LITTLE HARDER.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.067
-HE'S GOT LOTS OF CASH
IN HERE.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.067
-THERE'S A BUNCH
OF BAGGIES IN THERE, TOO.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.633
-THE ROCK WAS FOUND
ON HER SIDE.

11:34.733 --> 11:36.900
I'M WILLING TO BET THAT WHILE
HE WAS DRIVING AND SWERVING,

11:37.067 --> 11:38.167
HE WENT TO THROW IT
OUT THE WINDOW,

11:38.267 --> 11:40.400
THE WINDOWS DOWN, AND IT GOT
SUCKED BACK IN THE CAR

11:40.500 --> 11:41.667
AND IT LANDED RIGHT THERE.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.433
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

11:43.533 --> 11:44.833
-(laughing) PROBABLY.

11:44.933 --> 11:46.633
-LET ME TALK TO HIM.
SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT.

11:46.733 --> 11:48.333
MAYBE HE'LL TAKE THE BEAT
FOR HIS GIRL.

11:50.967 --> 11:53.433
HEY, PARTNER. THIS IS
THE DEAL, OKAY?

11:53.533 --> 11:55.433
IT'S LIKE, HONESTY HOUR, OKAY?

11:55.533 --> 11:57.767
SO, OBVIOUSLY,

11:57.867 --> 12:02.067
I'M THINKING THAT YOU WERE,
YOU KNOW, SWERVING DOWN THE ROAD

12:02.133 --> 12:05.067
AND RUNNING, AND YOU PROBABLY
TRIED TO THROW THIS
OUT THE WINDOW, RIGHT?

12:05.167 --> 12:07.267
AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN YOU
WENT TO THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW,

12:07.367 --> 12:09.267
IT DIDN'T GO OUT THE WINDOW,
IT LANDED ON THE FLOOR BOARD

12:09.367 --> 12:11.600
RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR GIRL'S
SEAT RIGHT THERE.

12:11.700 --> 12:13.200
-HELL NO.
-NO?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.500
SO, WHAT ABOUT ALL THE BAGGIES?
WHAT ARE ALL THE BAGGIES FOR?
-FOR WEED.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.267
-FOR WEED?
-YEAH, I HAD WEED.

12:17.367 --> 12:19.400
-SO, YOU SELL WEED? THAT'S WHERE
YOU GOT THE CASH FROM?
-NO, I DON'T SELL WEED, NO.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.900
I DON'T SELL WEED, NO.

12:21.067 --> 12:23.100
-OKAY, SO IF YOU DON'T SELL IT,
WHY DO YOU NEED BAGGIES
TO BAG IT?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.700
-I DON'T KNOW.
SOMEONE GAVE 'EM TO ME.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.533
-SOMEONE GAVE YOU THEM NOW?
-THEY JUST GAVE ME A BUNCH
OF BAGGIES,

12:26.633 --> 12:28.067
THAT'S WHY I PUT 'EM
IN MY POCKET, YES.
-OKAY.

12:28.133 --> 12:30.067
-'CAUSE THAT DOPE AIN'T MINE.
-SO, SOMEONE GAVE YOU BAGGIES

12:30.100 --> 12:32.333
THAT YOU WERE INITIALLY
GONNA USE FOR WEED,

12:32.433 --> 12:34.167
BUT YOU DIDN'T BECAUSE
YOU DON'T SELL WEED,

12:34.267 --> 12:36.067
AND NOW YOU'RE JUST
CARRYING THE BAGGIES AROUND?

12:36.133 --> 12:37.267
IS THAT RIGHT?
-NO.

12:37.367 --> 12:38.733
-OKAY, SO THIS ISN'T YOUR METH?
-NO.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.800
-'CAUSE I'M GONNA TAKE YOUR GIRL
FOR SALE AND FOR TRANSPORTATION.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.067
-THAT'S NOT MINE,
DUDE. THAT'S...

12:43.133 --> 12:44.333
-OKAY?
-THAT'S NOT MINE.

12:44.433 --> 12:45.700
-DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID?
-YEAH.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.900
-SO, IT'S ON HER THEN, RIGHT?

12:48.067 --> 12:50.400
-I GUESS. THAT AIN'T MINE.
THAT AIN'T MINE.
-OKAY.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.167
ALL RIGHT.
-I DON'T KNOW WHO'S IT IS.

12:53.267 --> 12:55.367
-OKAY. SO, WHERE'D YOU
GET ALL THE CASH FROM?

12:55.467 --> 12:57.500
-I TAKE CARE OF MY BROTHER.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.800
HE'S ON PSYCH MEDS AND STUFF.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.067
-YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOUR BROTHER,

13:00.133 --> 13:01.767
AND THEY PAY YOU IN CASH?

13:01.867 --> 13:04.167
SMALL DENOMINATIONS,
BIG DENOMINATIONS, JUST RANDOM
CASH THEY JUST HAND YOU?

13:04.267 --> 13:05.633
-NO, ALL OF THAT
WASN'T FROM THAT.

13:05.733 --> 13:07.733
-OKAY, WHERE WAS
THE REST OF IT FROM?
-IT'S JUST...

13:07.833 --> 13:10.267
FROM A FRIEND. I DON'T...

13:10.367 --> 13:12.900
-OKAY. SO, IT'S YOUR CASH,
IT'S YOUR BAGGIES,

13:13.067 --> 13:15.600
BUT YOU WERE JUST CARRYING THEM
AROUND OR HOLDING THEM.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.633
IT'S NOT YOUR METH. WHAT ABOUT
THIS WEED SHE HAS
AND THE METH PIPE?

13:18.733 --> 13:20.867
IS THAT HERS?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.067
OKAY.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.533
ALL RIGHT.

13:23.633 --> 13:25.067
THE ROCK WAS FOUND
ON HER SIDE,

13:25.167 --> 13:27.367
AND HE'S GOT ALL THE BAGGIES,
HE'S GOT ALL THE CASH.

13:27.467 --> 13:29.067
HE'S GOT THE SCALE
BEHIND HIS SEAT,

13:29.167 --> 13:31.267
AND THEN HE TRIED TO THROW
THE METH OUT, IS WHAT HE
WAS TRYING TO GET RID OF.

13:31.367 --> 13:32.300
SO...
-SMART MOVE.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.467
-I'LL TAKE HIM
FOR THE SALES.

13:33.567 --> 13:34.800
AND FOR HER,

13:34.900 --> 13:36.633
I MEAN, ALL SHE HAS ON HER
IS A PIPE AND SOME WEED, SO...

13:36.733 --> 13:38.400
I THINK, MAYBE WRITE HER
A CITE, AND THAT'S IT.

13:40.433 --> 13:42.467
-PINELLAS COUNTY
IS A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE,

13:42.567 --> 13:44.400
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE KIDS.
THERE'S A LOT TO DO.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.167
I LOVE GOING TO THE BEACH
WITH MY FAMILY,

13:46.267 --> 13:48.533
AND TAKING THE KAYAK OUT,
GOING FISHING.

13:48.633 --> 13:51.367
I CAME FROM A SMALL AGENCY
TO START MY CAREER.

13:51.467 --> 13:53.233
PINELLAS COUNTY
IS A LOT BIGGER.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.267
IT'S A LOT MORE...
DEMOGRAPHICS OF PEOPLE

13:56.367 --> 13:59.567
THAT YOU CAN DEAL WITH
AND HELP WITH AND HELP
SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS.

14:01.367 --> 14:04.967
WE'RE GONNA STOP THIS CAR.
HE WAS GOING A LITTLE FAST
DOWN THE ROAD

14:05.067 --> 14:06.333
AS I WAS PACING IT.

14:06.433 --> 14:08.533
AND THEN, AS IT MADE
A LEFT-HAND TURN,

14:08.633 --> 14:10.600
IT DIDN'T COME
TO A COMPLETE STOP.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.700
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

14:21.800 --> 14:23.300
-HEY, OFFICER, I...

14:23.400 --> 14:26.367
I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT I WAS DOING WRONG.

14:26.467 --> 14:28.667
-LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, LET ME
GET YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE

14:28.767 --> 14:30.233
FIRST AND THEN
I'LL GO FROM THERE.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.100
-I HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE
LEGAL, I JUST DON'T HAVE
AN I.D. ON ME.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.667
-YOU JUST DON'T HAVE
AN I.D. ON YOU?
-NO, SIR.

14:33.767 --> 14:35.867
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES,
I JUST DON'T HAVE AN I.D.
ON ME.

14:35.967 --> 14:37.800
-OKAY. DO YOU HAVE
A VALID LICENSE?

14:37.900 --> 14:38.833
-YES, IT'S VALID, SIR.

14:38.933 --> 14:39.967
-OKAY, WHOSE CAR IS THIS?

14:40.067 --> 14:41.367
-MINE.
-YOURS? OKAY.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.267
WHAT'S YOUR FIRST NAME, BOSS?
-MICHAEL.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.700
-MICHAEL, YOU HAVE ANYTHING
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.167
-UM...

14:55.467 --> 14:57.167
I GOT MY MOM'S INSURANCE.

14:57.267 --> 14:59.167
-YOU DON'T HAVE A WALLET
OF ANY SORTS ON YOU?

14:59.267 --> 15:01.833
-I DON'T HAVE ONE, NO.
THEY GOT EVERYTHING.

15:01.933 --> 15:03.700
I KNOW I HAVE A VALID LICENSE
AND EVERYTHING.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.967
I KNEW, I TOLD THEM
ONE OF THEM SHOULD HAVE
BEEN DRIVING.

15:06.067 --> 15:07.267
-HOW OLD ARE YOU?

15:07.367 --> 15:08.300
-27, SIR.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.067
-HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE MICHAEL?

15:10.100 --> 15:12.300
-I MEAN, I COULD GIVE YOU...

15:12.400 --> 15:13.500
I MEAN, I COULD--

15:13.600 --> 15:15.533
-DO ME A FAVOR, STEP OUT
FOR A SECOND, REAL QUICK.

15:21.533 --> 15:24.200
ALL RIGHT, HANG TIGHT
FOR ONE SECOND, ALL RIGHT?

15:24.300 --> 15:28.733
I JUST STOPPED THIS CAR
FOR SPEEDING AND
THE STOP SIGN VIOLATION.

15:28.833 --> 15:32.067
I'M JUST GONNA RUN
THE DRIVER AND THE OCCUPANTS.

15:32.167 --> 15:34.067
THEY'VE GOT THREE
OTHER OCCUPANTS IN THE CAR.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.167
SEE IF ANY OF THEM
HAVE ANY WARRANTS,

15:37.267 --> 15:39.133
OR IF THE DRIVER'S
GOT A VALID LICENSE.

15:40.467 --> 15:42.867
YEAH, HIS I.D.
IS LOOKING DIFFERENT.

15:42.967 --> 15:44.433
UH, MICHAEL.

15:44.533 --> 15:46.667
I GOT A UNIT COMING THAT'S
GONNA TAKE YOUR FINGERPRINT.

15:46.767 --> 15:48.667
OKAY? COME SIT AT--
SIT HERE ON THE BUMPER.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.067
YOU'RE NOT MICHAEL,
I KNOW THAT.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.100
-I'VE BEEN DRIVING, BUT
I JUST GOT A WARRANT OUT.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.200
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO IN, MAN.
-WHAT'S THE WARRANT FOR?

15:54.300 --> 15:55.467
-V.O.P.

15:55.567 --> 15:56.600
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.633
WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME?
-JASON.

15:58.733 --> 16:00.067
-JASON.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.567
OKAY.

16:01.667 --> 16:05.300
THIS DEPUTY'S GONNA TAKE IT
JUST TO CONFIRM THAT'S
WHO YOU ARE.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.533
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING
LIKE THE NAME

16:07.633 --> 16:10.133
THAT HE PROVIDED
ON OUR DATABASE.

16:11.467 --> 16:12.567
SO, UH...

16:12.667 --> 16:14.467
THIS DEPUTY'S JUST TAKING
HIS FINGERPRINT

16:14.567 --> 16:17.067
JUST TO CONFIRM HIS IDENTITY.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.467
SO, APPARENTLY,
OUR DRIVER

16:19.567 --> 16:21.633
PROVIDED THE NAME
OF HIS BROTHER.

16:21.733 --> 16:24.400
BECAUSE HE HAD WHAT HE BELIEVES
TO BE A WARRANT

16:24.500 --> 16:26.300
FOR VIOLATION
OF PROBATION.

16:28.267 --> 16:33.067
FELON WITH A... FELON DELINQUENT
POSSESSION OF A GUN...

16:33.167 --> 16:35.967
AND DEALING IN
STOLEN PROPERTY.

16:36.067 --> 16:39.200
-SORRY, MAN, I DON'T WANNA
GET CHARGED, SO I GAVE
A FAKE NAME.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.333
-JASON?

16:40.433 --> 16:42.467
IS YOUR REAL NAME NOW,
NOT MICHAEL?

16:42.567 --> 16:43.800
WHO IS MICHAEL?

16:43.900 --> 16:44.933
-THAT'S MY BROTHER.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.667
-SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL?
YOU JUST HAVE A WARRANT?

16:46.767 --> 16:48.667
-YES, SIR.
-OKAY, DO ME A FAVOR,
STAND UP FOR ME.

16:48.767 --> 16:50.733
I'M JUST GONNA DETAIN YOU
UNTIL I FIGURE OUT WHAT'S
GOING ON

16:50.833 --> 16:52.200
AND WHO YOU ARE, OKAY?

16:54.567 --> 16:56.867
ALL RIGHT, SPREAD YOUR FEET
REAL WIDE FOR ME, OKAY?

17:04.167 --> 17:05.367
WHAT'S IN THERE?

17:05.467 --> 17:06.800
-JUST POWDER. I JUST...

17:06.900 --> 17:08.933
I WAS TURNING MYSELF IN
TOMORROW MORNING.

17:09.067 --> 17:10.133
-LITTLE POWDER COKE?

17:10.233 --> 17:11.467
-YEAH. THAT'S IT, SIR.

17:11.567 --> 17:13.300
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
ON THEM. THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.567
PLEASE DON'T CHARGE...
-IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
IN THE CAR?

17:15.667 --> 17:17.633
-NO, SIR.
-YOU KNOW, JUST THAT LITTLE
AMOUNT RIGHT THERE

17:17.733 --> 17:20.167
IS ENOUGH TO CHARGE YOU
WITH POSSESSION. YOU DON'T
NEED A WHOLE BUNCH.

17:20.267 --> 17:21.767
-PLEASE, SIR, DON'T
CHARGE ME WITH THAT.

17:21.867 --> 17:23.600
-WHEN DID YOU LAST USE?

17:23.700 --> 17:25.400
-PROBABLY ABOUT
FOUR O'CLOCK TODAY.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.500
-FOUR O'CLOCK TODAY.
HOW MUCH YOU PAY
FOR THAT LITTLE BAG?

17:27.600 --> 17:28.900
-10 BUCKS.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.800
-ALL RIGHT, HANG TIGHT
FOR ONE SECOND, ALL RIGHT?

17:34.900 --> 17:38.067
I'M JUST GONNA TEST
THAT DIME BAG FOR THE WHITE
POWDER IN THERE,

17:38.167 --> 17:41.600
SEE IF IT COMES BACK
POSITIVE FOR COCAINE.

17:45.233 --> 17:48.067
SO, ONCE THE LIQUID GOES
DOWN INTO THE Q-TIP,

17:48.133 --> 17:50.733
AND ONCE IT TOUCHES
THE COCAINE,

17:50.833 --> 17:52.633
IT'LL TURN A BLUE COLOR.

17:52.733 --> 17:54.800
IT'LL LET YOU KNOW
THAT YOU HAVE A POSITIVE HIT.

17:57.267 --> 17:59.800
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU SEE HOW
IT TURNED FROM PINK
TO BLUE?

17:59.900 --> 18:03.267
THAT RIGHT THERE LETS YOU KNOW
THAT YOU HAVE A POSITIVE TEST
FOR COCAINE,

18:03.367 --> 18:05.567
AND THAT THIS SUBSTANCE
IS, IN FACT, COCAINE

18:05.667 --> 18:09.067
AND IT'S NOT BAKING POWDER,
OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.467
SO...

18:10.567 --> 18:13.533
NOW HE'LL HAVE A FELONY
CHARGE FOR POSSESSION
OF COCAINE.

18:16.300 --> 18:19.267
LET ME SEE YOUR EYES,
REAL QUICK.

18:19.367 --> 18:20.833
HOW MUCH YOU HAVE
TO DRINK TONIGHT?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.133
-I HAVEN'T DRUNK AT ALL.
YOU CAN BREATHALYZE ME.
I DON'T DRINK.

18:23.233 --> 18:25.400
-OKAY. BUT YOU USED
COKE TODAY.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.333
-ABOUT FIVE HOURS AGO.
-AND YOU DROVE WITH IT.

18:27.433 --> 18:30.067
SO, DO YOU NOT THINK
YOU'RE UNDER THE INFLUENCE
OF COKE?

18:30.100 --> 18:32.367
-UH, IT WAS PROBABLY
ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE
HOURS AGO.

18:32.467 --> 18:34.100
-THAT DOESN'T ANSWER
MY QUESTION.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.900
DO YOU THINK...

18:36.067 --> 18:38.133
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE STILL
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF COKE?
-PLEASE, SIR.

18:38.233 --> 18:40.267
PLEASE, SIR.
-OPEN YOUR MOUTH UP WIDE.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.733
PUT YOUR TONGUE DOWN.

18:42.833 --> 18:44.667
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SMOKED MARIJUANA?

18:44.767 --> 18:47.200
-I DON'T SMOKE WEED, SIR.
-YOU CAN DRUG TEST ME
FOR EVERYTHING.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.333
I'M JUST DIRTY FOR MAR--
UH, COCAINE.

18:52.567 --> 18:53.800
I GOT TWO CHARGES?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.367
-WELL, ACTUALLY,
YOU GOT THREE CHARGES.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.133
ONE, PROVIDING A FALSE NAME.

18:57.233 --> 19:00.067
TWO, IF YOU HAVE A WARRANT,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
THE WARRANT CHARGE.

19:00.167 --> 19:03.067
AND THREE, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE THE POSSESSION
OF COCAINE CHARGE.

19:03.133 --> 19:04.600
-DOES IT HAVE TO BE THAT?

19:04.700 --> 19:06.433
CAN I JUST GET THE COCAINE,
NOT THE FALSE NAME?

19:06.533 --> 19:08.067
-DID YOU GIVE--

19:08.167 --> 19:11.067
ANSWER MY QUESTION.
DID YOU GIVE ME A FAKE NAME?

19:11.100 --> 19:12.633
-BUT YOU GAVE ME A CHANCE
AND I WAS HONEST.

19:12.733 --> 19:14.933
-DID YOU GIVE ME
A FAKE NAME?

19:15.067 --> 19:16.967
DID YOU PROVIDE A NAME
OTHER THAN YOURS

19:17.067 --> 19:19.800
THAT YOU BELIEVED--
FOR ME TO BELIEVE WAS YOU?

19:19.900 --> 19:21.367
-ALL RIGHT.
-ALL RIGHT,
SO OBVIOUSLY,

19:21.467 --> 19:22.767
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GETTING
THE THREE CHARGES.

19:22.867 --> 19:24.067
YOU GOT ANY QUESTIONS
FOR ME?

19:24.133 --> 19:25.567
-CAN IT BE PARAPHERNALIA?

19:25.667 --> 19:27.333
I MEAN, I DID--
I KNOW I DID IT--

19:27.433 --> 19:31.633
-I MEAN, YOU GOT A DIME BAG
WITH DRUGS IN IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:31.733 --> 19:33.700
-THAT'S PARAPHERNALIA, THOUGH,
IT'S JUST AN EMPTY BAG.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.500
-IT'S STILL GOT DRUGS IN IT.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.967
I CAN TEST IT RIGHT NOW,
AND IT'LL COME BACK
POSITIVE FOR COCAINE.

19:38.067 --> 19:40.200
SO, YOU GOT FALSE NAME,

19:40.300 --> 19:42.867
THE WARRANT,
AND THE DRUG POSSESSION, OKAY?

19:42.967 --> 19:46.300
ALL RIGHT?
YOUR BUDDIES TOOK THE CAR
FOR YOU, OKAY?

19:46.400 --> 19:48.200
ALL RIGHT. PUT YOUR FEET IN.

19:50.133 --> 19:51.167
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:51.267 --> 19:52.833
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:52.933 --> 19:54.600
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:54.700 --> 19:55.633
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:55.733 --> 19:58.700
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.200 --> 20:06.133
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:06.233 --> 20:07.733
-(theme music playing)
