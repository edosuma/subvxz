00:56.623 --> 01:00.150
This is a true story about friendship
that runs deeper than blood.

01:01.361 --> 01:04.194
This is my story and that of
the only three friends in my life...

01:04.263 --> 01:06.732
who truly mattered.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.134
Two of them were killers
who never made it past the age of 30.

01:11.204 --> 01:14.935
The other is a nonpracticing attorney
living with the pain of his past...

01:15.008 --> 01:18.444
too afraid to let it go,
never confronting its horror.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.312
I'm the only one who can speak for them
and the children we were.

03:00.713 --> 03:04.513
<i>Walk, walk</i>
<i>Walk, walk</i>

03:05.518 --> 03:07.713
My three friends and I
were inseparable...

03:07.787 --> 03:10.722
happy and content to live
in the closed world of Hell's Kitchen.

03:10.790 --> 03:14.123
The West Side streets of Manhattan
were our private playground.

03:14.194 --> 03:18.494
A cement kingdom where we felt ourselves
to be nothing less than absolute rulers.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.392
Hell's Kitchen was populated
by an uneasy blend of Irish, Italian...

03:24.470 --> 03:27.098
Puerto Rican
and Eastern European laborers.

03:27.173 --> 03:29.164
Hard men living hard lives.

03:29.242 --> 03:31.073
Move it!

03:32.078 --> 03:33.739
<i>He said</i>

03:33.813 --> 03:37.112
<i>Walk like a man</i>
<i>Talk like a man</i>

03:37.183 --> 03:39.174
Shut the fuck up!

03:39.252 --> 03:42.585
We lived in railroad apartments
inside redbrick tenements.

03:42.655 --> 03:45.624
Few mothers worked and all had
trouble with the men they married.

03:45.692 --> 03:48.024
Get the fuck down and shut up!

03:48.094 --> 03:49.755
Get the fuck down!

03:49.829 --> 03:52.593
Get the fuck down
and shut the fuck up!

03:52.665 --> 03:55.327
I buried one fucking wife,
I can bury another one.

04:01.441 --> 04:04.433
Domestic violence was
a cottage industry in Hell's Kitchen...

04:04.510 --> 04:07.445
yet there was no divorce
and few separations.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.447
The will of the church was forceful.

04:09.515 --> 04:12.507
For a marriage to end,
someone usually had to die.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.456
Yet despite the harshness of life...

04:17.523 --> 04:20.617
Hell's Kitchen offered
the kids on its streets a safety net...

04:20.692 --> 04:23.491
enjoyed by few other neighborhoods.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.191
Crimes against people of the
neighborhood were not permitted.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.796
When they did occur,
the punishment doled out was severe...

04:29.869 --> 04:32.064
and in some cases final.

04:32.138 --> 04:34.129
A drug dealer from
an uptown neighborhood...

04:34.207 --> 04:36.141
moved heroin into Hell's Kitchen.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.235
Packet killed the 12-year-old son
of a Puerto Rican numbers runner.

04:39.312 --> 04:42.110
It was the last packet
the dealer ever sold.

04:43.116 --> 04:47.018
Hell's Kitchen was a place of innocence
ruled by corruption.

04:49.322 --> 04:52.291
My friends and I spent lots of time
inside Holy Angels.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.588
We each served as altar boys.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.595
Everyone wanted
to work funeral masses...

04:56.663 --> 04:58.722
since the funeral
included a $3 fee...

04:58.798 --> 05:01.289
and more if you looked
sufficiently somber.

05:02.869 --> 05:05.201
There was an active competition
between the four of us...

05:05.271 --> 05:08.263
to come up with
the best and boldest prank.

05:08.341 --> 05:11.003
Two weeks into the new school year
I found the nuns' clacker...

05:11.077 --> 05:13.739
in the school hallway,
and I was ready for the big leagues.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.077
l... I'm very pleased that so many
boys and girls are going to...

05:16.149 --> 05:18.140
In church it was used
to alert the girls as to when...

05:18.217 --> 05:20.481
they should stand,
sit, kneel and genuflect...

05:20.553 --> 05:23.488
all based on the number of times
a clacker was pressed.

05:23.556 --> 05:26.423
In my pocket, it was cause for havoc.

05:27.527 --> 05:31.395
And, uh, it will be a great day.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.226
You will be defenders of the faith...

05:38.304 --> 05:40.602
you will be soldiers of Christ...

05:40.673 --> 05:42.732
and you will receive the gifts...

05:42.809 --> 05:44.936
of the Holy Spirit.

05:50.917 --> 05:53.385
Well, it's gonna be a great day...

05:53.453 --> 05:55.387
and your parents
will be very proud of you.

05:55.455 --> 05:58.720
When you were baptized,
godparents made promises for you...

05:58.791 --> 06:00.725
and now you're gonna
confirm those promises.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.658
Let me have the clacker.

06:02.729 --> 06:05.459
- What clacker?
- Now.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.726
Let everyone rise.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.566
Let us pray.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.713
Nuns are such easy targets.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.980
John and I spent more time
in church than the others.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.887
We were the only two of the group
to give any thought of entering
the priesthood.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.619
And John and I were intrigued
by the powers a priest was given.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.684
A secret world of betrayal
and deceit...

06:35.762 --> 06:38.993
where people openly admitted
dark misdeeds and vile indiscretions.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.556
Confession was better than any book
we could get our hands on...

06:41.634 --> 06:44.467
or any movie we could see,
because the sins were real...

06:44.537 --> 06:46.528
committed by people we knew.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.097
The temptation to be part of that
was far too great to resist.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.370
If we get caught, they'll burn us.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.378
What if our mothers are out there?

06:53.446 --> 06:55.880
What if we end up
hearing their confessions?

06:55.948 --> 06:58.781
- Yeah, what if we hear something worse?
- Like what?

06:58.851 --> 07:00.842
Like a murder.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.013
What if somebody
cops to a murder?

07:03.089 --> 07:06.991
Relax. All we gotta do is sit back,
listen, and remember not to laugh.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.858
Hide.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.768
Seconds later,
our booth comes to life.

07:17.837 --> 07:20.829
l, uh, sleep with married men.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.809
Men with families.

07:24.510 --> 07:28.674
In the morning I tell myself
it's the last time, but it never is.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.241
Yes?

07:33.319 --> 07:35.844
You see, I'm, uh...

07:35.922 --> 07:38.083
I'm pregnant.

07:40.359 --> 07:44.295
- The father?
- Huh, take a number.

07:44.363 --> 07:48.595
- What are you going to do?
- I know what you want me to do.

07:48.668 --> 07:51.432
And I know what I should do.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.496
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.402
Look, I gotta go.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.845
Thanks for listenin', fellas.
I really appreciated it.

08:01.914 --> 08:04.405
I know you'll keep it to yourselves.

08:10.389 --> 08:13.381
- She knew.
- Yeah, she knew.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.690
Why do you think she told us all that?

08:16.762 --> 08:19.754
I don't know.
I guess she had to tell somebody.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.600
Father Robert Carillo
was a longshoreman's son...

08:25.671 --> 08:28.868
who was as comfortable sitting
on a barstool in a back-alley saloon...

08:28.941 --> 08:31.603
as he was standing at the altar
during High Mass.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.840
He had toyed with the life of petty
crime before finding his calling.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.381
He was a friend. A friend
who just happened to be a priest.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.645
You know what crap like that
does to your body?

08:39.719 --> 08:43.052
Come on, Father. It beats smoking,
and it's cheaper too.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.147
Maybe.

08:45.224 --> 08:48.523
- So what do you hear? Anything?
- No, nothin'.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.585
I hear you're interested
in becomin' a priest.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.631
Who says?

08:52.698 --> 08:55.360
Word is, you wanna get the feel
of a confessional booth.

08:55.434 --> 08:57.959
I don't know
what you're talking about, Father.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.028
- You don't, huh?
- No.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.097
Well, maybe I got
the wrong information.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.369
Yeah, I guess you did.

09:04.443 --> 09:06.377
I'll see you later tonight.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.276
What's tonight?

09:08.347 --> 09:10.474
I gotta drop some books
and magazines off...

09:10.550 --> 09:12.711
for the elderly and disabled
around the neighborhood.

09:12.785 --> 09:16.414
- Your mother said you'd love to help.
- Yeah, I bet she did.

09:18.324 --> 09:22.055
Shakes, I don't want you
getting into any trouble.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.460
Come on, Father.
You know I never do.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.794
That's all I wish
for you and your friends.

09:26.866 --> 09:28.857
- That's it?
- That's it. Nothing else. I swear.

09:28.935 --> 09:31.733
- That's it.
- You know, a priest shouldn't swear.

09:31.804 --> 09:34.272
And kids shouldn't be listening
to other people's confessions.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.331
- I'll see you tonight.
- All right. See you.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.104
Okay.

09:40.813 --> 09:43.304
Michael was the most sexually
experienced of our group...

09:43.382 --> 09:46.283
which meant that he kissed a girl
on more than one occasion.

09:46.352 --> 09:48.980
But his real love was Carol Martinez.

09:49.055 --> 09:51.580
Hell's Kitchen's half-breed...
half Puerto Rican, half Irish.

09:51.657 --> 09:55.252
She was raised by her father,
her mother having died at childbirth.

09:55.328 --> 09:59.628
Carol stayed pretty much to herself, but
was always comfortable in our company.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.690
We could always count on Carol
to stand sentry...

10:01.767 --> 10:03.735
on the first night of the Ice Capades.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.794
While crowds of families
lined the front of the Garden...

10:05.871 --> 10:07.839
waiting to see the skaters perform...

10:07.907 --> 10:09.670
we each had one eye in a hole...

10:09.742 --> 10:11.767
watching two dozen beautiful,
nearly naked women...

10:11.844 --> 10:13.835
get into their skaters' outfits.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.217
This is what heaven must be about.

10:19.285 --> 10:23.381
<i>Good, good, good, good vibrations</i>

10:23.456 --> 10:25.287
Oh, my God!

10:27.460 --> 10:31.487
- Hey, uh, Carol, you wanna take a look?
- Like it's something I haven't seen.

10:32.498 --> 10:34.523
So lucky. Oh, wow.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.431
She's so beautiful.
Oh, my...

10:36.502 --> 10:39.665
I could die now,
and I wouldn't be sad.

10:39.739 --> 10:41.707
When my friends and I were young...

10:41.774 --> 10:44.766
Hell's Kitchen was run
by a man named King Benny.

10:44.844 --> 10:48.109
When he was young, King Benny
was a hit man for Lucky Luciano.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.274
Lucky Luciano did a lot of good
for this country during World War II...

10:51.350 --> 10:54.285
but you ain't gonna read about that
in any fucking history book.

10:54.353 --> 10:57.288
There was talk King Benny
was the shooter of Mad Dog Coll...

10:57.356 --> 10:59.756
that prick on West 23rd Street.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.759
He ran bootleg with Dutch Schultz...

11:01.827 --> 11:05.126
and he opened up a couple of clubs
with Tough Tony Anastasia.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.529
I was 14 when I first heard about him.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.593
The story goes, as a kid
he wasn't much of anything.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.299
He was always getting the shit
kicked out of him in street fights.

11:14.373 --> 11:16.898
And then one day...
and who the fuck knows why...

11:16.976 --> 11:20.173
some Irish guy about 25 years old...

11:20.246 --> 11:23.875
he takes King Benny and he flings him
down a flight of stairs.

11:23.949 --> 11:26.884
King Benny breaks
all his teeth in the front.

11:26.952 --> 11:29.546
You know what King Benny does?

11:29.622 --> 11:31.783
He waits.

11:31.857 --> 11:35.349
He waits eight years
to get even with that prick.

11:35.428 --> 11:39.364
He walks into a public bathhouse.
The guy's soaking in the tub.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.299
King Benny
takes out his front teeth.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.359
He lays 'em down on the sink.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.768
Then he looks over at the guy
and he says...

11:49.442 --> 11:53.572
"When I look in the mirror,
I see your face."

11:53.646 --> 11:55.705
Then he pulls out a gun...

11:56.449 --> 11:58.576
and he shoots the guy
twice in each leg.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.585
Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!

12:01.620 --> 12:03.611
Then he says to the guy...

12:03.689 --> 12:07.921
" Now when you take a bath
you see mine."

12:08.928 --> 12:12.420
No one ever fucked
with King Benny after that.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.557
Revenge.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.064
Revenge.

12:19.705 --> 12:21.798
Can I talk to you for a minute?

12:21.874 --> 12:25.503
I'd like to work for you,
help you out, whatever you need.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.910
You're the butcher's kid.
Am I right?

12:27.980 --> 12:29.948
- Yeah.
- Well...

12:30.015 --> 12:32.074
what kind of job
are you looking for?

12:32.151 --> 12:34.278
Whatever.
It doesn't matter.

12:34.353 --> 12:36.685
Oh, doesn't matter, huh?

12:37.857 --> 12:40.690
Everybody says this is the place
to come for jobs.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.661
- Who is "everybody"?
- People from the neighborhood.

12:43.729 --> 12:45.560
Oh, them.

12:45.631 --> 12:48.259
Let me ask you,
what the fuck do they know?

12:48.334 --> 12:50.996
They know you got jobs.

12:55.841 --> 12:58.674
Sorry I wasted your time.

12:58.744 --> 13:01.645
- Hold on a sec.
- Yeah?

13:01.714 --> 13:03.841
Come back tomorrow
if you wanna work.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.679
- What time tomorrow?
- Anytime.

13:05.751 --> 13:08.948
- You'll be here?
- I'm always here.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.456
My first job for King Benny
paid $25 a week...

13:18.531 --> 13:21.466
and ate up only 40 minutes
of my time.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.469
In the dark clubroom, one of the guys
would hand me a crumpled paper bag...

13:24.537 --> 13:27.734
and direct me to one of the two
local police precincts for delivery.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.798
Hey, it was a perfect way
to handle payouts.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.866
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on.

13:31.944 --> 13:35.345
Let's go. Right here. See what kind
of cash you got in that bag.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.575
You gotta be nuts.
You know who you're taking off?

13:37.650 --> 13:41.086
Yeah, we know,
and we're scared shitless.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.917
Give me the bag.
Give me the fucking bag!

13:43.989 --> 13:46.355
Hey, what you do there?

13:46.425 --> 13:48.689
- Answer me! What you do there?
- Relax.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.924
- They stopped me and took my money.
- You took the money from the boy?

13:51.997 --> 13:54.022
- The money they took is in the bag.
- Let me have the bag.

13:54.099 --> 13:57.330
- Fuck you!
- Oh, yeah? How about now?

13:57.403 --> 14:00.236
- All right, all right, take it easy.
- Ah, you're not smart anymore.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.297
- Take it easy.
- Now you... This make you stupid.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.365
Let me have the bag.

14:05.377 --> 14:07.868
All right. Thanks, kid.
Now go.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.778
- What about them?
- You care?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.079
- No.
- Then go! Go! Run!

14:13.919 --> 14:17.116
I need somebody with me.
What if the old guy hadn't shown?

14:17.189 --> 14:19.783
- What you need?
- My friends.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.521
Your friends?
What do you think, this is camp?

14:22.595 --> 14:25.928
These kids you can trust.
I've known 'em half my life.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.924
Okay, get your friends.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.993
Father Bobby knew my friends and I
worked for King Benny...

14:32.071 --> 14:33.732
and he wasn't pleased.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.502
He wasn't worried about
the pocket money, but the next step...

14:36.575 --> 14:38.736
when they ask you to pick up a gun.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.802
He didn't want that to happen to us.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.871
You think running for King Benny
is a good idea, huh?

14:42.948 --> 14:44.939
- It pays.
- Pays? A lot of things pay.

14:45.017 --> 14:48.282
Not like this.
Whoa!

14:48.354 --> 14:50.822
Most priests liked to preach
from the pulpit.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.986
Father Bobby liked to talk during
the bump and shove of a pickup game.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.927
- Oh, good shot!
- All right, you the man.

14:57.997 --> 15:01.364
- I found an art class for you to take.
- You know I can't afford
to take any art classes.

15:01.433 --> 15:04.266
No, you don't have to pay anything.
Teacher's a friend of mine. Hmm?

15:04.336 --> 15:07.567
- I don't know. It could be
nothing but a waste of time, Father.
- Maybe.

15:07.640 --> 15:11.235
- Or it could be the first step.
- First step to what?
- To doing somethin' with your life.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.709
You never know.
It may help you get out of here.

15:12.778 --> 15:15.508
- You all could get out of here.
- Guys, are we gonna talk
or play basketball?

15:15.581 --> 15:17.515
Come on. Let's play.

15:18.517 --> 15:21.509
- Listen, I got a story I wanna tell you.
- It ain't the one about
the lepers, is it?

15:21.587 --> 15:24.420
- 'Cause that one gave me nightmares.
- No lepers. Michelangelo.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.823
He was born poor just like you guys.
He was a painter. He was a sculptor.

15:27.893 --> 15:31.294
He takes this job from the pope.
Good money, good work.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.590
Okay, Father, but, uh,
why'd the pope call him?

15:34.667 --> 15:36.760
Because the pope was looking
for the best guy he could find...

15:36.835 --> 15:38.826
to paint the ceiling
of his church in Rome.

15:38.904 --> 15:42.340
- Don't sound like
that big a job, Father.
- Well, to Michelangelo, it was.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.399
Michelangelo needed the...
needed the job...

15:44.476 --> 15:47.138
'cause it paid more money
than he ever had in his life.

15:47.212 --> 15:50.204
That way, he could pay off
the loan sharks that were
chasing his father down.

15:50.282 --> 15:54.446
- What's his father?
- He was, uh, like a low-level con guy.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.613
He conned people
out of money, goats, sheep.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.486
- Goats?
- Chickens, whatever he could.

15:58.557 --> 16:00.184
- Chickens?
- Chickens?
- Chickens?

16:00.259 --> 16:02.250
- You know what happened?
- What?
- What?

16:02.328 --> 16:04.319
He painted a ceiling
no one will ever forget.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.990
Painted like it was touched
by the hand of God.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.660
- Did he pay off the loans?
- Every single one.

16:09.735 --> 16:12.863
Hey, Father, how long did it take him?
You know, painting the ceiling and all?

16:12.938 --> 16:15.839
- Took him about nine years.
- Nine years?

16:15.908 --> 16:17.637
- That's right.
- That's a big ceiling.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.803
I had a Puerto Rican guy
do my whole apartment in two days.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.539
And he had a bum leg.

16:21.613 --> 16:23.843
You know, I don't know
what I'm gonna do with you guys.

16:25.184 --> 16:27.846
- Hey, just give us a job painting.
- You know what it was?
You know what it was?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.911
- The Sistine Chapel.
- Sixteenth Chapel?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.583
- Sistine Chapel.
- Who painted the other 15?

16:40.599 --> 16:42.590
Outside events meant little.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.000
In a society changing radically
by the hour...

16:45.070 --> 16:48.198
we watched the images scatter nightly
across the TV screens.

16:48.273 --> 16:50.901
Young protesters spoke about
how they were gonna change our lives...

16:50.976 --> 16:53.274
and fix the world.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.813
But while they shouted their slogans...

16:55.881 --> 16:57.872
my friends and I
went to funeral services...

16:57.950 --> 16:59.941
for the young men of Hell's Kitchen...

17:00.019 --> 17:03.045
who came back from Vietnam
in body bags.

17:03.122 --> 17:06.489
We viewed with skepticism
the faces on television...

17:06.558 --> 17:09.617
those protected by money
and upper middle-class standing.

17:12.297 --> 17:15.824
A growing army of feminists
marched across the country...

17:15.901 --> 17:17.892
demanding equality...

17:17.970 --> 17:19.961
yet our mothers still
cooked and cared for men...

17:20.039 --> 17:22.030
who abused them
mentally and physically.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.701
For me and my friends,
these developments carried no weight.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.374
They might as well have occurred
in another country...

17:30.449 --> 17:32.644
in another century.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.879
Our attention was elsewhere.

17:34.953 --> 17:38.013
We sat with Father Bobby in a third
floor hospital ward visiting John...

17:38.090 --> 17:40.388
hoping he'd recover
from a punctured lung...

17:40.459 --> 17:42.950
a gift from one of his mother's
overzealous boyfriends.

17:43.028 --> 17:45.087
I hope you like these.

17:45.164 --> 17:48.156
- You better not tell me you don't.
- Okay.

17:51.003 --> 17:53.198
Father Bobby
didn't let that situation rest.

17:53.272 --> 17:56.332
- I gave on Sunday. I'm in a rush, okay?
- John Reilly.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.900
Little punk. He got out of line,
so I put him back in line. No big deal.

17:59.978 --> 18:02.742
- You put him in the hospital.
- He's alive, ain't he?

18:02.815 --> 18:05.477
Look, if he's smart
he learned himself a lesson.

18:05.551 --> 18:08.816
- What are you, about 220? 230?
- Yeah.

18:08.887 --> 18:12.823
You're a big guy. How much
do you thinkJohn Reilly weighs?

18:12.891 --> 18:16.884
80? 85?
That's not even a featherweight.

18:16.962 --> 18:19.453
If this were a fight,
you'd be way out of your division.

18:19.531 --> 18:23.433
Look, it was a slap.
It was nothing.

18:23.502 --> 18:25.970
Well, next time you'll be meeting me.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.029
And I may not be in your division...

18:28.107 --> 18:30.667
but I do weigh more than 85 pounds.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.676
And you won't need a doctor
when I'm done.

18:32.744 --> 18:36.510
You'll need a priest
to pray over your body.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.543
See you in church.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.760
Father Bobby would have
made a good hit man.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.729
It's a shame we lost him
to the other side.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.727
We were down 7-6 in the last inning
of a sewer-to-sewer stickball game...

18:58.804 --> 19:01.967
- Against Hector Maldonado
and three of his friends.
- Come on, Mike.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.201
Come on, Davy!
Strike this chump out!

19:04.276 --> 19:06.608
- He got nothin'!
- Shut up!

19:06.678 --> 19:09.078
- Who's that?
- Sister.

19:10.082 --> 19:12.073
- What happened to her?
- I'm not sure.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.813
Some kind of cancer got in her legs
or somethin'. Worry about the game.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.878
- Come on.
- That's true. Come on. Hit a home run.

19:16.955 --> 19:18.946
Come on, Davy!
Strike this scumbag out!

19:19.024 --> 19:21.254
He can't touch you, Davy!
He can't touch you!

19:21.326 --> 19:23.988
Hey, while you don't got any legs,
you got a lot of tongue!

19:24.062 --> 19:25.893
This is it. Home run.

19:25.964 --> 19:28.489
- Oh, easy, Mike.
- Yeah, Davy!

19:28.567 --> 19:30.933
What the fuck you looking at,
little dick?

19:31.970 --> 19:33.904
- She's nothing but charm.
- Come on. All right, man.

19:33.972 --> 19:35.735
- Let's play!
- Come on, Davy!
- You take him.

19:35.807 --> 19:39.299
- You can take him, Mikey.
- Yeah! I told you he wasn't shit, baby!

19:39.378 --> 19:41.676
Hey, swallow your tongue,
you little gimp bitch!

19:41.747 --> 19:44.580
You could've helped her
across the street or you could've
bought her an ice cream.

19:44.650 --> 19:48.484
- Didn't have to throw the game.
- Yeah, now we're the Salvation Army.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.886
You ever wonder why
there ain't a Salvation Navy?

19:50.956 --> 19:54.949
Game over, losers.
Cough up the cash. A buck each.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.621
- He's no better than you.
- He was today.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.721
No, you let him be...

19:59.798 --> 20:02.858
all because Irish here has a thing
for little girls with no legs.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.301
Stay away from us, Fat Man.
All right?

20:05.370 --> 20:07.361
You boys are soft like bread.

20:07.439 --> 20:10.931
It's going to catch up to you, and
when it does, it's going to hurt bad.

20:11.009 --> 20:14.172
What happens is our business,
not yours. Okay?

20:14.246 --> 20:16.237
You gotta stay tough to be tough.

20:16.315 --> 20:19.250
Guy smells it when you're weak,
eat you like a salad.

20:19.318 --> 20:22.185
You see that street?
That street is the dish of life.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.245
And you boys are appetizers.

20:24.323 --> 20:27.656
Somebody gonna come along, eat you up
and forget about you by dessert.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.388
Take it easy, Fat Man.
It was just a stickball game.

20:30.462 --> 20:33.363
Yes, but going soft
is a habit, you know?

20:33.432 --> 20:37.027
You have to keep yourself mean
and guide your life around it.

20:37.102 --> 20:39.093
- All right, all right, calm down.
- It's the only way for boys.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.469
It's like hanging out
with fuckin' Confucius over here.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.474
- Yeah.
- Be funny, limp dick.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.534
Look, this just free advice from me to
you. You take it or you throw it away.

20:46.612 --> 20:49.479
- It don't matter.
- Thanks a lot, Fat Man.

20:51.216 --> 20:53.980
In truth, we were all surprised
by Michael's actions...

20:54.052 --> 20:56.043
but in his mind losing that game...

20:56.121 --> 20:58.612
and handing a feeling of victory
to a girl in a wheelchair...

20:58.690 --> 21:01.056
was more than the right thing to do.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.766
Come on. Let's go swimming.

21:11.837 --> 21:13.828
The temperature
topped out at 98 degrees...

21:13.905 --> 21:16.271
on the day our lives
were forever altered.

21:16.341 --> 21:19.276
I'm frying like an egg up here.
I say we get some butter rolls...

21:19.344 --> 21:21.812
a couple of sodas, and head down
to the docks to cool off.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.041
- It's hot.
- Can't you feel the breeze up here?
- What breeze?

21:24.116 --> 21:26.778
- We're surrounded by a wall, genius.
- The devil couldn't even stand this.

21:26.852 --> 21:29.821
Will you guys shut up, please?
I'm trying to get my burn.

21:29.888 --> 21:33.722
- It's 98 degrees, John.
- There's some breeze up here.
- It's a hot breeze.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.283
We haven't hit the hot dog vendor
in a couple of weeks.

21:36.361 --> 21:40.024
I don't know, Mikey.
That cart guy ain't like the others.

21:40.098 --> 21:43.625
I mean, he gets pretty pissed... like
crazy... when you try to take him off.

21:43.702 --> 21:47.798
We can eat hot dogs,
or we can eat air. Choose.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.137
Air's probably safer, Mike.

21:51.209 --> 21:53.575
Yeah, a hot dog ain't worth
bleedin' over, Mikey.

21:53.645 --> 21:57.137
- Yeah, but anyway, whose turn was it?
- Yours.

21:57.215 --> 21:59.843
- Yeah, it's yours.
- Mine? It's not my turn.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.909
- Yes, it is.
- I went, like, last month.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.978
- He went two weeks...
- You never went.
- Last month.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.786
- Are you nuts? I went right after him.
- I'm not going.
- Why?

22:06.858 --> 22:09.554
- It's too hot.
- Why not?
- I walk down the stairs, I'll pass out.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.493
Mustard, onions, no soda.

22:15.567 --> 22:19.333
- I know you.
- I look like a lot of people.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.065
The scam was simple.

22:21.139 --> 22:24.404
I was to walk up to the hot dog vendor
and order what I wanted.

22:24.476 --> 22:28.435
The vendor would then hand me my hot dog
and watch as I ran off without paying.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.573
This left the vendor with two choices,
neither very appealing.

22:31.650 --> 22:35.177
He could stand his ground and swallow
his loss, or he could give chase.

22:35.253 --> 22:37.414
The second forces him
to abandon the cart...

22:37.489 --> 22:40.083
where my friends could feast
in his absence.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.352
Uh, I'm gonna need two napkins.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.122
Hey, my money! Thief!

22:49.134 --> 22:51.068
<i>Well, my temperature's rising</i>

22:51.136 --> 22:53.127
- <i>And my feet on the floor</i>
- Yes!

22:53.205 --> 22:56.140
- <i>Twenty people knockin'</i>
<i>'cause they're wanting some more</i>
- All aboard. Ketchup.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.903
I took it from him and ran.

22:57.976 --> 23:02.310
I scooted past Tommy Mung's Dry Cleaners
and Armand's Shoe Repair.

23:02.381 --> 23:06.613
The vendor gave chase, a wooden-handled,
pronged fork in one hand.

23:06.685 --> 23:09.119
All right. More. Give me two.

23:10.122 --> 23:13.455
- <i>Gimme some</i>
- <i>Gimme, gimme some lovin'</i>

23:13.525 --> 23:16.688
- <i>Gimme some lovin'</i>
- <i>Gimme, gimme some lovin'</i>

23:16.762 --> 23:19.287
<i>Gimme some lovin'every day</i>

23:19.364 --> 23:21.594
You know, these things
are heavier than they look.

23:21.666 --> 23:24.760
Genius, these are gas tanks
to keep the food hot.

23:24.836 --> 23:26.997
They're heavier than shit.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.563
Think we can push it,
the three of us?

23:29.641 --> 23:32.439
- Push it where, huh?
- Couple of blocks.

23:32.511 --> 23:35.571
Be a nice surprise for the guy, when
he comes back from chasing Shakes...

23:35.647 --> 23:37.808
not to find his cart.

23:37.883 --> 23:39.714
<i>Hey</i>

23:41.319 --> 23:44.618
<i>Well, I feel so good</i>
<i>Everything is sounding hot</i>

23:44.689 --> 23:48.352
<i>You better take it easy</i>
<i>'cause the place is on fire</i>

23:48.427 --> 23:51.362
<i>Been a hard day</i>
<i>and I have so much to do</i>

23:51.430 --> 23:54.263
<i>We made it, baby</i>
<i>and it happened to you</i>

23:54.332 --> 23:57.768
<i>And I'm so glad we made it</i>

23:57.836 --> 24:02.000
The vendor tired at 47 th and 9th.
I was on the other side of the street.

24:04.042 --> 24:06.704
He was beat, but not beaten.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.713
He could go 10 minutes more
just on hate alone.

24:09.781 --> 24:13.046
Come on. Give it up.

24:26.097 --> 24:28.156
What's wrong, Mikey?

24:28.233 --> 24:31.760
Shakes is taking too long.
He should've been back by now.

24:31.837 --> 24:33.828
He'll be fine. He's Shakes.

24:33.905 --> 24:36.396
<i>You better take it easy</i>
<i>'cause the place is on fire</i>

24:36.475 --> 24:38.966
You guys were supposed to take
the hot dogs, not the wagon.

24:39.044 --> 24:41.205
- Oh, now he tells us.
- He's coming fast, Mikey.

24:41.279 --> 24:43.270
- He's still running?
- He's coming?

24:43.348 --> 24:46.010
I got a plan.
Come on. Over by the subway.

24:46.084 --> 24:48.075
The plan, as it turned out,
was as simple...

24:48.153 --> 24:50.178
and as dumb as anything
we'd ever done.

24:50.255 --> 24:52.689
We were to hold the cart
on the top edge of the stairwell...

24:52.757 --> 24:54.918
leaning it downward,
and wait for the vendor.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.984
We were to let it go
the second he grabbed the handles.

24:57.062 --> 24:59.053
Then we'd leave the scene
as he struggled...

24:59.130 --> 25:01.121
to ease the cart
back onto the sidewalk.

25:01.199 --> 25:03.565
To this day,
I don't know why we did it...

25:03.635 --> 25:06.069
but we would all pay a price.

25:06.137 --> 25:09.470
It only took a minute,
but in that minute everything changed.

25:09.541 --> 25:11.202
- You got it?
- Shit. Hold it up.

25:11.276 --> 25:14.734
I can't hold it! I can't hold it!
I can't hold it!

25:14.813 --> 25:17.213
- Hold it up! Come on!
- I can't!

25:17.282 --> 25:19.375
- Shit!
- No!

25:30.428 --> 25:32.896
Stop! Get out of... No!

25:55.520 --> 25:57.249
Damn!

26:01.560 --> 26:03.892
- My God!
- SweetJesus!

26:03.962 --> 26:06.089
What have you boys done?

26:06.164 --> 26:08.724
What in the name of God
have you boys done?

26:08.800 --> 26:10.791
I think we just killed a man.

26:15.740 --> 26:19.369
WhileJames Caldwell was slowly
recovering at St. Claire's Hospital...

26:19.444 --> 26:21.435
we were charged
with reckless endangerment...

26:21.513 --> 26:23.504
and remanded
into our parents' custody.

26:24.349 --> 26:28.308
- I'm sorry, Dad!
- That ain't gonna do you much good.

26:28.386 --> 26:31.685
Take it easy!
This is no time to get crazy!

26:32.357 --> 26:35.190
You're going to jail, and you don't
even know what the fuck that means!

26:35.260 --> 26:37.091
Ma!

26:38.096 --> 26:40.530
You stay out of this.
He's just a kid.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.035
He shouldn't have to do time. Nobody
in this family should have to do time.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.503
I done enough time for everybody!

27:12.697 --> 27:14.688
I hear you're short an altar boy.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.394
You still remember what to do?

27:21.406 --> 27:24.739
Easy on the water,
heavy on the wine...

27:24.809 --> 27:28.176
and ring the bells whenever
I see someone start to nod off.

27:28.246 --> 27:30.908
Get ready. We got five minutes
till showtime.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.486
I'm gonna miss this.

27:47.932 --> 27:49.923
I'm gonna miss all this.

27:51.336 --> 27:55.067
I've been doing all I can,
but so far every door I touch is locked.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.945
I could run.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.004
We all could run.

28:06.051 --> 28:08.076
Disappear for a while.

28:08.153 --> 28:10.212
Nobody's gonna come looking.

28:11.556 --> 28:13.547
Nobody's gonna care about us...

28:14.826 --> 28:16.987
about where we go.

28:21.499 --> 28:24.593
You run now,
you're gonna run till you die.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.703
Hiding's not gonna make it go away.

28:28.773 --> 28:30.866
People aren't gonna forget.

28:32.110 --> 28:34.101
You've gotta face this.

28:39.751 --> 28:41.742
I can't, Father.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.679
I don't wanna face it.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.450
I'm too scared to face it.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.053
I'm scared too.

28:53.131 --> 28:56.100
Nobody's more scared than I am.

28:56.167 --> 28:58.658
But you gotta do it.

29:00.505 --> 29:02.837
You're gonna be okay.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.535
You're gonna make it through there.

29:05.610 --> 29:07.601
You understand?

29:12.217 --> 29:14.947
Come on. We got an audience.

29:21.259 --> 29:24.922
I counted three rummies
and four widows on my way in.

29:26.998 --> 29:30.434
Plus, Fat Ralphie's sleeping one off
in the last row.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.098
It's the rain. Bad weather
always brings in the crowds.

29:40.245 --> 29:42.805
This is one of my favorites.

29:42.881 --> 29:44.542
What is?

29:45.683 --> 29:50.279
"Whatever you do to the least
of my brethren, you do to me."

29:54.425 --> 29:56.086
Come on.

30:02.267 --> 30:04.428
We never saw the vendor as a man...

30:04.502 --> 30:07.369
not the way we saw
other men of the neighborhood...

30:07.438 --> 30:10.965
and we didn't care enough about him
to grant him any respect.

30:11.042 --> 30:13.533
We gave little notice
to how hard he worked...

30:13.611 --> 30:16.239
or that he had a wife
and two kids in Greece...

30:16.314 --> 30:18.305
and hoped to bring them
to this country.

30:18.383 --> 30:20.749
We didn't pay attention
to the long hours he worked.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.810
We didn't see any of that.

30:22.887 --> 30:25.321
We only saw a free lunch.

30:27.392 --> 30:30.020
Thomas Marcano, the Court
hereby sentences you...

30:30.094 --> 30:33.996
to be remanded for a period of no more
than 18 months, no less than one year...

30:34.065 --> 30:35.999
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

30:36.067 --> 30:38.831
John Reilly, the Court
hereby sentences you...

30:38.903 --> 30:43.033
to be remanded for a period of no more
than 18 months, no less than one year...

30:43.107 --> 30:45.041
to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

30:45.109 --> 30:47.100
Lorenzo Carcaterra...

30:48.112 --> 30:51.081
taking into consideration
that you arrived on the scene...

30:51.149 --> 30:53.583
after the theft of the cart
had already occurred...

30:53.651 --> 30:56.347
in consideration of that, the Court
hereby sentences you to serve...

30:56.421 --> 30:58.821
no more than one year,
no less than six months...

30:58.890 --> 31:00.881
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

31:02.227 --> 31:04.058
Michael Sullivan...

31:04.128 --> 31:06.460
the Court hereby sentences you
to be remanded for a period...

31:06.531 --> 31:10.729
of no more than 18 months, no less than
one year at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

31:10.802 --> 31:14.135
And I might add, had it not been for the
intervention of Father Robert Carillo...

31:14.205 --> 31:17.003
who spoke in glowing terms
on your behalf...

31:17.075 --> 31:20.272
I would have sentenced you
to a much stiffer punishment.

31:20.345 --> 31:22.643
I still have my doubts
as to your inherent goodness...

31:22.714 --> 31:25.148
but only time will serve
to prove me wrong.

31:28.686 --> 31:31.917
- Could you do me a favor, Father?
- What do you want? Name it.

31:31.990 --> 31:33.981
The past couple of weeks...

31:34.058 --> 31:37.221
my mother and father looked like
they were ready to kill each other.

31:37.295 --> 31:39.889
- Could you watch over 'em for me?
- I will.

31:40.899 --> 31:45.063
And no matter what you hear,
tell 'em I'm doing okay.

31:45.136 --> 31:48.003
You mean, you want me to lie?

31:48.072 --> 31:51.064
It's a good lie, Father.
You can do it.

31:53.711 --> 31:55.906
Come on. Let's go.

31:56.981 --> 31:59.848
- Be strong.
- I will.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.519
The Wilkinson Home for Boys
held 780 youthful offenders...

32:40.591 --> 32:42.718
housed in five separate units.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.955
From the outside,
the facility resembled...

32:45.029 --> 32:47.964
what those who ran it
wanted it to resemble...

32:48.032 --> 32:50.694
some kind of nice school
or university.

32:52.036 --> 32:56.302
Michael, Tommy, John and I were
assigned to the second floor of group C.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.865
We each had a private 12-foot room.

32:58.943 --> 33:03.437
I'd been in my room less than an hour
when the panic set in.

33:03.514 --> 33:06.312
It doesn't take very long to know
how tough a person you are...

33:06.384 --> 33:08.375
or how strong you can be.

33:08.453 --> 33:12.890
I knew from my first day at Wilkinson
that I was neither tough nor strong.

33:24.068 --> 33:26.002
Hello, Carcaterra.

33:27.572 --> 33:31.440
- Toss your clothes on the floor.
- Here?

33:31.509 --> 33:33.670
What, are you expecting a dressing room?
We don't have any.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.270
- Now, lose the clothes.
- In front of you?

33:44.689 --> 33:46.953
Let's go. Let's go.

33:56.834 --> 34:00.099
What's that piece of shit
around your neck? Take it off.

34:00.171 --> 34:02.298
It's Mary.
You know, the Mother of God.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.467
I don't give a fuck whose mother it is.
Take it off.

34:18.089 --> 34:20.080
Everything.

34:20.158 --> 34:23.719
- So you want me to stand here naked?
- Now you're catching on.

34:23.795 --> 34:27.253
I knew you Hell's Kitchen boys
weren't as dumb as everyone says.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.803
Now what?

34:38.376 --> 34:40.367
Get dressed.

34:44.549 --> 34:46.540
There were four guards
assigned to each floor...

34:46.617 --> 34:51.077
with one... in our case, Nokes...
designated group leader.

34:52.123 --> 34:54.614
Ferguson was the only son
of a slain New York state trooper...

34:54.692 --> 34:56.683
and was on the waiting list
for both the New York City...

34:56.761 --> 34:58.922
and Suffolk County
police departments.

34:58.996 --> 35:03.456
Styler was using his job at Wilkinson's
to finance his way through law school.

35:03.534 --> 35:05.525
Addison was a graduate
of the local high school...

35:05.603 --> 35:08.436
who wanted nothing more
than a steady job that paid well.

35:08.506 --> 35:09.996
Hey. Come on. Quit pushing.

35:10.074 --> 35:12.736
It was not a group
of innocent young boys at Wilkinson.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.971
Most, if not all, the inmates
belonged there.

35:15.046 --> 35:17.981
A number of them were riding out
their second and third convictions.

35:18.049 --> 35:22.213
All were violent offenders. Few seemed
sorry about what they had done.

35:22.286 --> 35:24.413
And as for rehabilitation?

35:24.489 --> 35:26.320
Forget it.

35:31.729 --> 35:33.390
Mikey.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.122
Yeah, all right.

36:01.559 --> 36:04.494
Hey, what the fuck
did you do that for?

36:04.562 --> 36:07.963
- You got close to me.
- So?

36:08.032 --> 36:10.330
It bothers me.

36:10.401 --> 36:13.666
I don't wanna be near you
or your creeped-out friends.

36:18.309 --> 36:20.368
Whoa! Yes!

36:20.444 --> 36:22.378
Fight!

37:09.527 --> 37:12.826
You know, your time here
hasn't taught you shit.

37:13.831 --> 37:16.163
You're still the same
fuckin' bunch of clowns you were...

37:16.234 --> 37:18.327
the day you walked in here.

37:19.704 --> 37:23.800
Okay. Everybody go on back
and finish your lunches.

37:23.874 --> 37:25.865
There's nothing more to see.

37:27.044 --> 37:29.444
Go on, go. Sit down.
Get out of here.

37:31.816 --> 37:34.512
Go on.

37:34.585 --> 37:36.576
Go ahead.

37:43.327 --> 37:46.819
- That go for me too?
- No, it don't go for you.

37:46.897 --> 37:49.730
You go back to your room.
You're through with your lunch.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.861
Go on.

37:52.937 --> 37:56.134
You and me, we're gonna finish this
sometime real soon.

37:56.207 --> 38:00.109
- Yeah, maybe at dinner.
- So...

38:00.177 --> 38:02.611
you Hell's Kitchen boys
get any lunch?

38:04.815 --> 38:07.409
I got to smell it.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.476
You got to smell it.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.720
That's good.
Hey, hey, hey!

38:14.792 --> 38:17.022
Where you goin'?

38:17.094 --> 38:19.028
You said to get lunch.

38:19.096 --> 38:22.031
Oh, you boys don't need to get back
in line to get lunch, 'cause...

38:22.099 --> 38:25.557
there's plenty to eat
right where you're standing.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.627
You can smell it.

38:32.576 --> 38:34.737
I'm not hungry.

38:34.812 --> 38:37.747
Well, I don't give a fuck
if you're hungry or not.

38:37.815 --> 38:40.477
You eat because
I'm telling you to eat.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.653
I'm still not hungry.

38:52.296 --> 38:55.925
I'll tell you when you're
hungry or not. Now eat.

38:58.402 --> 39:01.166
Excuse me.
What the fuck are you looking at?

39:01.238 --> 39:06.005
Get the fuck down on your knees now
and finish your goddamn lunch!

39:07.011 --> 39:10.811
Come on. Now, eat! Don't think
you got all fucking day here! Eat!

39:10.881 --> 39:14.544
You got some mashed potatoes.
Come on. Suck up some of thatJell-O.

39:14.618 --> 39:16.916
Come on, now,
you fuckin' assholes. Eat.

39:16.987 --> 39:19.956
Don't be thinking you got all day.
Hurry up. Come on. Now, let's go.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.356
Let's go. Hey!

39:22.426 --> 39:23.859
None of you clowns are leaving here...

39:23.928 --> 39:26.294
until these assholes finish
their goddamn lunch.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.093
You got that?

39:28.165 --> 39:30.156
Hey, you. Here's a piece of bread.
There you go.

39:30.234 --> 39:33.260
You can't have a good lunch
without a nice piece of bread. Eat!

39:33.337 --> 39:36.135
Let's go! Come on, now.
That's good.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.903
That's good. Yeah, show the boys
how you follow my rules.

39:38.976 --> 39:42.434
Rules! You understand?

39:42.513 --> 39:45.949
Hey, look, boys.
See how he follows my rules?

39:46.016 --> 39:48.075
Shift's over, Nokes.

39:48.152 --> 39:50.313
No, l-l... I'm not ready to go yet.

39:50.388 --> 39:54.188
I still got a few more things I gotta
clean up here before I can leave.

39:54.258 --> 39:57.193
This is my tour now.
I'll clean what needs cleaning.

39:57.261 --> 40:00.230
Stay out of this one.
It's got nothing to do with you.

40:00.297 --> 40:03.562
This one I'm staying in.

40:06.971 --> 40:09.405
Don't fuck with me, boy.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.399
No, Nokes...

40:12.476 --> 40:15.172
you fuck with me.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.908
I'm asking you.

40:23.521 --> 40:25.580
You're eatin' into my shift.

40:28.159 --> 40:31.993
I'll get out of your way for now.

40:32.997 --> 40:35.192
I'll take what I can get.

40:37.067 --> 40:39.797
You boys get off your knees.

40:52.349 --> 40:55.944
It's a tragedy.
I'll tell you...

40:56.020 --> 40:58.284
I don't understand you boys.

40:58.355 --> 41:00.516
I don't think you know
what it means to have rules.

41:00.591 --> 41:03.617
You gotta have rules
and you gotta have discipline.

41:03.694 --> 41:06.527
Now, I don't know what it was like
in your homes and your home lives...

41:06.597 --> 41:10.533
but in my house, with my father,
there were rules...

41:10.601 --> 41:14.401
and if you... you didn't follow
the rules, there was hell to pay.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.464
You had rules,
and you had discipline.

41:18.542 --> 41:22.000
Sometimes it wasn't nice,
but, boy, we learned.

41:22.079 --> 41:23.740
We sure did learn.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.816
Yeah, right around there to the right.
There you go. Come on, now.

41:34.425 --> 41:36.518
I mean, it's a simple thing, really.

41:36.594 --> 41:39.825
You got rules,
and you got discipline.

41:39.897 --> 41:42.923
That's the beginning of the story,
and that's the end of the story.

41:49.974 --> 41:52.568
- Do we understand each other?
- Turn and face the wall.

41:52.643 --> 41:54.634
Face the wall.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.343
You too.

42:02.319 --> 42:05.755
Now, we got interrupted earlier
in the lunch room...

42:05.823 --> 42:09.122
but there's no one
to interrupt us here now.

42:19.236 --> 42:21.067
What do you want?

42:22.973 --> 42:25.703
A blow job.

42:25.776 --> 42:27.767
Face the wall!

42:32.249 --> 42:34.740
Down on your knees.

42:37.054 --> 42:39.045
Face the wall. Face it!

42:56.173 --> 42:59.438
There are no clear pictures
of the sexual abuse we endured.

42:59.510 --> 43:02.775
I buried it as deep
as it can possibly go.

43:02.846 --> 43:05.508
What I remember most clearly
from that chilly October night...

43:05.583 --> 43:07.983
was that it was my 14th birthday...

43:08.052 --> 43:10.043
and the end of my childhood.

43:19.897 --> 43:23.526
Early in my stay, I'd written
and asked my father not to come.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.592
I couldn't look at my father
and have him see in my face...

43:25.669 --> 43:27.534
all that had happened to me.

43:27.605 --> 43:30.699
Michael had done the same with
the interested members of his family.

43:30.774 --> 43:33.208
Tommy's mother couldn't
get it together to visit.

43:33.277 --> 43:35.438
John's mother
came up once a month.

43:38.649 --> 43:41.948
But no one could stop
Father Bobby from visiting.

43:43.287 --> 43:47.053
So listen, let's try to keep this
on a happy note, okay?

43:47.124 --> 43:50.059
Nokes warned us not to say anything
to Father Bobby.

43:50.127 --> 43:53.324
If we did,
the reprisals would be severe.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.977
You lost a few pounds.

44:10.047 --> 44:12.880
It's not exactly home cookin'.

44:12.950 --> 44:15.248
Sit down.

44:15.319 --> 44:18.755
So, I get to see
all four of you guys today.

44:18.822 --> 44:22.656
I loved Father Bobby,
but I couldn't stand to look at him.

44:22.726 --> 44:25.559
I was afraid he'd look right through me,
past the fear and the shame...

44:25.629 --> 44:27.062
right through to the truth.

44:27.131 --> 44:30.498
Shakes, is there anything
you wanna tell me?

44:31.502 --> 44:33.527
Anything at all?

44:34.538 --> 44:37.234
You shouldn't come here
anymore, Father.

44:39.076 --> 44:41.067
I appreciate it and all.

44:42.079 --> 44:44.411
I don't think it's
the right thing for you to do.

45:08.706 --> 45:13.109
I stopped off at Attica today on my way
up here to see an old friend of mine.

45:13.177 --> 45:15.270
You have any friends not in jail?

45:16.880 --> 45:18.871
Not as many as I would like.

45:20.084 --> 45:22.552
What's he in for?

45:22.619 --> 45:24.450
Triple murder.

45:24.521 --> 45:26.989
He killed three men
about 15 years ago.

45:28.225 --> 45:31.558
- And he's a good friend?
- Yeah, he was my best friend.

45:33.864 --> 45:35.695
We hung out together.

45:35.766 --> 45:38.496
We were close,
just like you and the guys.

45:50.514 --> 45:53.244
We were both sent up here.

45:55.552 --> 45:57.543
That's right.

45:59.123 --> 46:01.114
And it wasn't easy.

46:02.126 --> 46:05.118
Just like it's not easy
for you and the guys.

46:06.897 --> 46:09.024
This place killed him.

46:09.099 --> 46:11.431
Made him not care anymore.

46:15.472 --> 46:17.633
Don't let this place
do that to you, Shakes.

46:18.642 --> 46:22.544
Don't let it make you think
you're tougher than you are.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.604
I gotta go, Father.

46:32.422 --> 46:34.913
I'll see you in the Kitchen, hmm?

46:36.093 --> 46:38.084
I'm counting on you now.

46:39.096 --> 46:42.554
Wipe the tears off your face.
Don't let them see it.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.692
Don't let 'em see you crying.

46:44.768 --> 46:47.259
Don't give them the satisfaction.

46:49.740 --> 46:51.731
You'll be out of here
before you know it.

46:55.312 --> 46:57.712
You're gonna be okay.

47:03.453 --> 47:05.614
I didn't want to let him go.

47:05.689 --> 47:08.954
I never felt as close to anyone
as I felt to him that moment.

47:15.766 --> 47:18.257
A number of the inmates,
as tough as they acted during the day...

47:18.335 --> 47:21.532
would often cry themselves
to sleep at night.

47:21.605 --> 47:23.596
There were other cries too.

47:23.674 --> 47:26.905
These differed from those
filled with fear and loneliness.

47:26.977 --> 47:28.968
They were low and muffled...

47:29.046 --> 47:31.708
the sounds of pained anguish.

47:31.782 --> 47:34.774
Those cries can change
the course of a life.

47:34.852 --> 47:38.379
They are cries that, once heard,
can never be erased from memory.

47:38.455 --> 47:41.618
On this one night, those cries
belonged to my friend John...

47:41.692 --> 47:44.183
when Ralph Ferguson paid him a visit.

48:00.510 --> 48:03.604
I was expecting to read
30 book reports over the weekend.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.807
There were only six for me to read.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.874
Which means I'm missing how many?

48:08.886 --> 48:12.788
Man, this is English class.
Math's down the hall.

48:16.059 --> 48:19.119
Now, I want to help you.
You may not believe that...

48:19.196 --> 48:22.097
or you may not care,
but it's the truth.

48:28.972 --> 48:31.964
- You got a second?
- What, I do something wrong?

48:32.042 --> 48:35.239
No. You did a great job
on your book report.

48:36.880 --> 48:39.974
You really seemed to like the book.
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo. </i>

48:40.050 --> 48:43.451
It's my favorite. I liked it more
since that I've been in here.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.317
Why is that?

48:46.323 --> 48:50.692
It's like he wouldn't
let anyone beat him... the count.

48:50.761 --> 48:52.592
Took what he had to take...

48:52.663 --> 48:55.393
the beatings, insults and whatever...

48:55.465 --> 48:57.763
and he learned from it.

48:57.834 --> 49:02.498
Then when the time came for him
to do something, he made his move.

49:02.572 --> 49:05.769
- You admire that?
- No, I respect that.

49:07.277 --> 49:09.802
You... You got a copy
of the book at home?

49:09.880 --> 49:12.644
I got the <i>Classics Illustrated</i> comic.

49:12.716 --> 49:14.707
No, it's not the same thing.

49:14.785 --> 49:17.049
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm gonna miss morning roll call.

49:17.120 --> 49:20.647
Wait, wait, wait. One minute, one
minute. I've got something for you.

49:21.858 --> 49:25.191
- Thought you might like to have it.
- Are you serious?

49:25.262 --> 49:28.754
Well, you loved the book that much,
you should have a copy of your own.

49:28.832 --> 49:32.268
- I can't pay you.
- No, it's a gift.

49:32.336 --> 49:35.828
- You've gotten gifts before,
haven't you?
- It's been a while.

49:35.906 --> 49:38.397
Well, it's my way of saying thanks.

49:38.475 --> 49:40.443
For what?

49:40.510 --> 49:43.809
That somebody listens,
even if it's just one student.

49:43.880 --> 49:45.711
- You're a good teacher, Mr. Carlson...
- Listen...

49:45.782 --> 49:47.943
we can discuss the book
on Friday in class, if you, uh...

49:48.018 --> 49:49.883
think the count
can hold their attention.

49:49.953 --> 49:51.944
He's got a shot.

49:52.022 --> 49:54.115
Any particular section
I should read from?

49:54.191 --> 49:57.285
That's easy. The part
where he escapes from prison.

50:10.407 --> 50:13.865
Here you go, little star.
Here's your locker room.

50:20.684 --> 50:22.618
It was only a game...

50:22.686 --> 50:25.951
just a touch football game,
nothing more...

50:26.023 --> 50:28.355
but a game I wish
we had never played.

50:28.425 --> 50:30.723
- Hut, hut.
- Guards against inmates.

50:30.794 --> 50:33.319
The guards practiced
four times a week.

50:33.397 --> 50:36.195
- Our team was picked
the Monday before the game.
- Let's go.

50:36.266 --> 50:38.826
- We had a two-hour practice.
- Set. Hut.

50:38.902 --> 50:40.130
- Didn't matter much.
- Get him!

50:40.203 --> 50:41.898
We weren't supposed to win.

50:41.972 --> 50:43.997
We were just supposed to show up.

50:44.074 --> 50:46.542
Who's the toughest guy out here?

50:46.610 --> 50:48.441
How do you mean "tough"?

50:48.512 --> 50:50.980
- Who can talk and have everyone listen?
- Rizzo.

50:51.048 --> 50:53.039
Black kid over there.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.882
Michael saw an opening...

50:55.952 --> 50:58.944
a chance to bring the game to our level,
even out the field.

50:59.022 --> 51:02.287
But he needed help.
He needed Rizzo.

51:02.359 --> 51:04.452
Black kid with an Italian name.

51:04.528 --> 51:07.793
With Rizzo on our side,
we had a chance.

51:07.864 --> 51:11.322
Look, white boy, I don't know what
you play on the streets. I don't care.

51:11.401 --> 51:14.393
But in here the guards call the play,
and the play calls them to win the game.

51:14.471 --> 51:17.304
- Why?
- Look, man.

51:17.374 --> 51:20.707
Guards steer clear of me, all right?
They stay back and let me do my time.

51:20.777 --> 51:22.768
If I play in a game
and I put a hurtin' on one of them...

51:22.846 --> 51:24.677
that might change my cushion.

51:24.748 --> 51:28.206
I'm not saying we gotta win.
I just don't wanna take a beating.

51:28.285 --> 51:31.686
We do every day.
Why's Saturday special?

51:31.755 --> 51:33.780
'Cause on Saturday
we can hit back.

51:34.991 --> 51:36.583
Really.

51:36.660 --> 51:39.788
They don't fuck with you like they do
us, but they fuck with you another way.

51:39.863 --> 51:42.093
You're just an animal to 'em.

51:42.165 --> 51:44.861
- I don't give a fuck.
- Yeah, you do.

51:44.935 --> 51:48.564
And beating them on Saturday
is not gonna change a thing.

51:48.638 --> 51:52.802
- Then why, white boy? Why?
- To make them feel what we feel...

51:52.876 --> 51:54.867
just for a couple of hours.

51:56.413 --> 51:58.438
Now, don't try anything funny, Sambo.

51:58.515 --> 52:01.006
Nobody'll get hurt.
You know what I'm saying?

52:01.084 --> 52:03.552
- I call heads.
- He calls heads.

52:05.188 --> 52:07.349
He called heads.
It is a head.

52:09.192 --> 52:11.023
- Let's go.
- Go.

52:20.270 --> 52:24.036
You're gonna die, motherfucker.
You're gonna fucking die.

52:27.377 --> 52:29.368
- You all right?
- Yeah.

52:34.284 --> 52:36.582
None of you motherfuckers
can cover me!

52:36.653 --> 52:40.316
We got ourselves a game.
I'm feeling good today.

52:40.390 --> 52:42.255
This shit feels good.

52:47.097 --> 52:49.895
Hut, hut!

52:54.771 --> 52:57.433
- Fuck!
- Get the fuck off me!

53:04.648 --> 53:06.479
Yeah!

53:09.986 --> 53:12.318
Yeah, keep smiling,
you little pissant.

53:12.389 --> 53:13.879
Yeah.

53:15.125 --> 53:18.458
For 90 minutes,
we took the game out of the prison...

53:18.528 --> 53:20.962
moved it miles beyond the locked gates
and the sloping hills...

53:21.031 --> 53:22.965
of the surrounding countryside...

53:23.033 --> 53:27.129
and brought it back down to the streets
of the neighborhoods we'd come from.

53:27.204 --> 53:30.867
- For those 90 minutes,
we were once again free.
- Set.

53:39.349 --> 53:41.442
Yeah!

53:46.389 --> 53:49.051
Rizzo! Rizzo! Rizzo!

53:49.125 --> 53:51.821
Rizzo! Rizzo! Rizzo!

53:51.895 --> 53:54.056
Rizzo! Rizzo! Rizzo!

53:54.130 --> 53:55.563
Rizzo! Rizzo!

53:55.632 --> 53:58.100
Rizzo! Rizzo! Rizzo!

53:58.168 --> 54:00.329
Rizzo! Rizzo!

54:00.403 --> 54:02.394
- Rizzo! Rizzo! Rizzo!
- Rizzo.

54:02.472 --> 54:04.906
Rizzo.

54:04.975 --> 54:07.000
Rizzo.

54:07.077 --> 54:10.638
- Rizzo! Rizzo! Rizzo!
- Rizzo.
- Hey, Nokes.

54:10.714 --> 54:12.705
- Good game.
- Rizzo!

54:14.184 --> 54:16.175
For once, we had a victory.

54:16.253 --> 54:20.189
But it didn't last.
It couldn't last.

54:20.257 --> 54:23.420
And all I wanted to do was die.

54:23.493 --> 54:25.427
I was not alone in the hole.

54:25.495 --> 54:28.089
I knew my friends were
down in the depths with me...

54:28.164 --> 54:30.826
each in his own cell
and each in his own pain...

54:30.900 --> 54:32.834
suffering his own demons.

54:32.902 --> 54:35.496
Rizzo was there too.

54:37.173 --> 54:39.505
I had lost any sense of time.

55:19.582 --> 55:21.846
I thought you'd never wake up.

55:21.918 --> 55:23.909
I thought I'd never want to.

55:23.987 --> 55:27.218
John and Tommy
are on the other side there.

55:28.491 --> 55:31.187
How are they?

55:31.261 --> 55:33.627
They're alive.

55:33.697 --> 55:35.358
Who isn't?

55:37.033 --> 55:38.864
Rizzo.

55:40.737 --> 55:43.729
They killed him?

55:43.807 --> 55:45.900
They took turns beating him...

55:45.975 --> 55:48.944
until there was
nothing of that kid to beat.

55:52.949 --> 55:55.611
Rizzo was dead because of us.

55:55.685 --> 55:57.619
We made him think that
going up against the guards...

55:57.687 --> 56:01.179
in a meaningless football game
had some value...

56:01.257 --> 56:03.953
that it would give us
a reason to go on.

56:04.027 --> 56:07.019
Once again, we were wrong.

56:08.765 --> 56:12.531
- They give you your release date yet?
- Nokes had the letter from the warden.

56:12.602 --> 56:15.662
Waved it in front of me
then tore it up.

56:15.739 --> 56:17.639
When do you figure?

56:17.707 --> 56:21.507
I don't know. End of spring,
early summer or something.

56:21.578 --> 56:24.046
I wish we were comin' with ya.

56:24.114 --> 56:27.845
Would've been nice for all of us
to walk out together, you know.

56:27.917 --> 56:32.115
No use thinking about that. We're gonna
do a full year, and not an hour less.

56:33.556 --> 56:36.923
When I get out, I could get Father Bobby
to make a couple of phone calls, huh?

56:36.993 --> 56:39.655
- Shave a month or two off.
- There's nothin' to talk about.

56:39.729 --> 56:41.720
There's a lot to talk about.

56:41.798 --> 56:45.131
Maybe if people knew what was
going on in here they'd make a move.

56:45.201 --> 56:47.431
I don't want anybody to know.

56:47.504 --> 56:51.270
Not Father Bobby, King Benny,
Fat Mancho...

56:51.341 --> 56:54.003
not my mother, nobody.

56:55.345 --> 56:57.176
Yeah, I don't either. I mean...

56:57.247 --> 56:59.909
I wouldn't know what to say
to anyone who did know.

56:59.983 --> 57:03.077
I can't think of anybody
who needs to hear about it.

57:03.153 --> 57:05.178
I mean, either
they won't believe it...

57:05.255 --> 57:07.280
or they won't give a shit.

57:07.357 --> 57:10.884
Yeah, I don't even think we should
talk about it once it's over, you know?

57:11.928 --> 57:14.123
We got no choice
but to live with it...

57:14.197 --> 57:17.189
and talking makes living it harder...

57:17.267 --> 57:20.202
so we might as well
not even talk about it.

57:20.270 --> 57:22.261
The truth stays with us.

57:25.041 --> 57:28.238
I wanna be able
to sleep one night...

57:28.311 --> 57:30.779
and not have to worry
who's coming in my room...

57:30.847 --> 57:33.042
what's gonna happen to me.

57:35.652 --> 57:38.485
If I can get that...

57:38.555 --> 57:41.046
then I'll be happy.

57:42.492 --> 57:45.484
Someday, John. Promise.

58:02.212 --> 58:06.114
I was in my last hours as an inmate
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

58:06.182 --> 58:08.548
I was given four copies
of my release form.

58:08.618 --> 58:11.382
The final reminder
of my time at Wilkinson.

58:12.722 --> 58:15.486
I never heard the key
turn in the lock...

58:15.558 --> 58:17.822
and I never heard
the snap of the bolt.

58:19.295 --> 58:21.855
You should be asleep.

58:21.931 --> 58:24.058
I just wanted to say good-bye.

58:25.068 --> 58:27.002
We all did.

58:28.605 --> 58:30.129
I told him...
I told him right to his face.

58:30.206 --> 58:32.606
I said, <i>"</i> I don't care
if you're paying the overtime or not.

58:32.675 --> 58:34.438
I'm not working
those kind of hours."

58:34.511 --> 58:36.775
- Yeah, but you put in for it?
- Yeah, I put in for it.

58:36.846 --> 58:39.644
'Cause I put in for it,
and they don't give it.

58:39.716 --> 58:43.015
I come in early three days.
They give me overtime? No.

58:44.020 --> 58:46.989
A part of all of us
was left there that night.

58:47.056 --> 58:49.991
A night that will never
be removed from my mind.

58:50.059 --> 58:53.324
The night ofJune 1, 1968.

58:53.396 --> 58:55.125
The Summer of Love.

58:56.132 --> 58:58.623
Our last night
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

59:44.814 --> 59:48.079
At 8:25 p.m., two men
walked through the doors.

59:48.151 --> 59:49.584
The bartender knew their faces...

59:49.652 --> 59:51.813
as most of the neighborhood
knew their names.

59:51.888 --> 59:54.755
They were two of the founding members
of the West Side Boys.

59:54.824 --> 59:57.793
They were also its deadliest.

59:57.860 --> 59:59.020
The blond-haired man...

59:59.095 --> 01:00:01.689
had been in and out of jail
since he was a teenager.

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:04.597
He robbed and killed at will,
or on command.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:07.932
He's presently a suspect
in four unsolved homicides.

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:12.100
He was an alcoholic and cocaine abuser
with a fast temper and a faster trigger.

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:15.702
He once shot a mechanic dead
for moving ahead of him in a movie line.

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:19.081
The dark-haired man
was equally deadly...

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:22.345
and had committed his first murder
at the age of 17.

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:24.648
In return he was paid $50.

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:26.382
He drank and he did drugs...

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.914
and he had a wife he never saw
living somewhere in Queens.

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:35.764
Making a noble attempt
to really change things.

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:39.461
- The Republicans will take the House.
- We've got a lot of work to do.

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:42.629
- It's gonna take more than four years...
- They take it at the midterm elections.

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:45.868
He's got the charisma.
He's gonna do it.

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:48.502
He's our man. Reagan's...
Reagan's the man who's gonna do it.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:50.307
He's gonna...
He's gonna move us forward.

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.940
Hey, Jerry.
What are they talkin' about?

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:55.576
They're talkin'
about Reagan's speech.

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:01.047
Order those two men some drinks
and put it on my tab.

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.386
- And Jerry.
- Yeah?

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:05.291
You tell them that Republicans
are not welcome in Hell's Kitchen...

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:09.127
and either a political conversion
or a change in conversation is in order.

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:11.598
Sure thing.

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:17.334
- Gentlemen.
- Yeah?

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:20.638
The gentleman there would like
to buy you a drink, on one condition.

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:25.044
You know the rules.
No religion. No politics. Hmm?

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:27.446
You get my meaning?

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:46.366
Order something for me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:20.135
Can I help you
with somethin', chief?

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:23.070
Not right now.

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:25.073
Enjoy the rest of your meal.

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:08.948
You know what the divorce rate was
in that company?

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:14.513
l, uh... I ordered the brisket
on a roll with fries.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:19.755
And, uh, two baskets of soda bread.
I know how you like that shit.

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:21.763
That okay by you?

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:26.733
Take a look at the guy at the table.
Take a good look.

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:40.281
Motherfucker.

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:09.467
- That's him.
- You fuckin' kiddin' me?

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:15.015
Bingo.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:43.409
- This is amazing.
- Hello. It's been a long time.

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:47.643
Who the fuck are you guys?

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:52.046
Hey. Who the fuck
asked you to sit down?

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:56.080
I thought you'd be happy to see us.
l-I guess I was wrong.

01:04:57.493 --> 01:04:59.791
You know, I thought
you'd do a lot better, you know.

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:03.320
You know, with all that training,
all that time you put in...

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:05.390
just to end up watchin'
someone else's money?

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:06.765
That seems like a waste.

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:08.929
I'm askin' y'all for the last time.
What the fuck do you want?

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:11.303
Why don't you take your time?
It'll come to you.

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:19.246
- I could see how he might forget us.
- Yeah.

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:22.284
You know, we were just somethin'
for you and your friends to play with.

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:24.911
It's a little harder
for us to forget.

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:28.354
You gave us
so much more to remember.

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:32.120
Can't quite place us,
can you, chief?

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:34.389
Let me help you out.

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:37.227
You're lookin' atJohn Reilly
and Tommy Marcano.

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.740
Oh, yeah.

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:49.978
Yeah, that's right.

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:58.009
It was a long time ago.

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:04.317
- So how ya been?
- Yeah, we ain't kids now.

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:06.623
Yeah. So what do ya want?

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:10.790
What I've always wanted
is to watch you die.

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:18.470
Oh, you ordered the meat loaf.

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:22.740
The brisket's really good here,
only you'll never know it.

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:26.270
You fucked up.

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:40.587
Nah, you were
scared little pricks.

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:44.162
Both of youse.

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:47.031
All of youse.

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:49.037
Scared shitless, but l...

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:53.367
I tried to make you tough.

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:55.933
- I tried to make you hard.
- I had you all wrong, then.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:59.675
All this time I thought you just liked
fucking and beating up little boys.

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:02.547
You two motherfuckers
are gonna burn in hell.

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:04.711
- You're gonna burn in hell.
- After you.

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.923
Did that hurt, Nokes?

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:54.231
Jerry. Sorry. Should've made
those brisket sandwiches to go.

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:01.776
Jesus!

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:10.081
- John Reilly, how do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:11.585
Thomas Marcano?

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:14.088
Not guilty, Your Honor.

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:16.124
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano...

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:19.161
you are hereby held
without bail.

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:20.718
In all the years
since Wilkinson's...

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:24.698
we had never once spoken to each other
about what had happened there.

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:26.701
We remained caring friends...

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:29.533
but the relationship
had been altered.

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:31.368
We drifted together...

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:34.000
always wondering
if that moment would arrive...

01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:36.169
that would force us
to deal with the past.

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:52.049
One down, Shakes.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.790
One down.

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:57.765
One what?

01:08:57.832 --> 01:09:01.701
One Sean Nokes.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.761
Nokes?

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.911
At the time of Nokes's shooting...

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:16.474
Michael was working as an assistant
New York district attorney.

01:09:16.551 --> 01:09:20.113
I got a call that he wanted to meet me
on 45th Street in Queens.

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.122
Then he hung up.

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:26.493
Hey. So what'd they say?

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:28.621
- What?
- John and Tommy. What'd they say?

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.631
It's a little cloak-and-dagger,
isn't it, Mike?

01:09:30.698 --> 01:09:33.462
Come on, man. Nokes.
They talk about him?

01:09:35.203 --> 01:09:37.604
- John did.
- Yeah?

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.162
What'd he say?

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:42.267
He said, <i>"</i> One down, Shakes.
One down."

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.241
Heard they hired Danny Snyder
as the lawyer. That right?

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:49.783
It's temporary. King Benny's
gonna move on one of his lawyers.

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:52.377
No, no, no, no. Don't let him do that.
It's not as perfect.

01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:56.049
- Perfect? The guy's a fall-down drunk.
- I'm telling you, he's perfect.

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.059
Perfect for what?

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:03.325
You coverin' this story
for your newspaper?

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:06.368
- Me?
- Yeah.
- I'm a timetable clerk, Mikey.

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:08.096
Ask me what movie's playing
at what time.

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.104
I'm lucky they let me
in the building.

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:16.302
Get some coffee?

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:18.312
Let's take a walk.

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:30.557
I'm gonna prosecute
John and Tommy in an open court.

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:34.925
- What? Are you fuckin' nuts?
- Just hear me out.

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:36.328
You should stay home tomorrow.

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.229
Call in sick
and save your life, Counselor.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.234
I'm not takin' this case to win.

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:44.101
I'm takin' this case to lose.

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:46.107
What does that mean?

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:50.268
It means it's payback time.

01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:55.283
Look. John and Tommy started this.
It's begun.

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.182
It's messy,
it's not how I had it planned...

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.187
but here it is.

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:02.517
You and l, we can finish it.

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:07.593
Finish what, Mikey?

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:11.030
You read
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> lately?

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.297
I don't know.
Ten years ago.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:17.828
See, I read a little bit of it
every night.

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:22.002
I read words like <i>"</i> revenge."
<i>"</i> Sweet, lasting revenge."

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:26.147
Payback time.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.277
It's our time.

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:31.979
What are you sayin', Mike?

01:11:32.054 --> 01:11:34.488
I'm sayin' it's time for all of us
to get a taste.

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.688
I'm sayin' it's time
to put an end to this.

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:43.228
Let's walk.

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:46.794
So I asked for the case.

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:49.030
Told 'em I was from
the same neighborhood as the accused.

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:51.231
Knew the mentality of the area.
Blah, blah, blah.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:53.036
They bought it.

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:55.576
And the connection
between John, Tommy and Nokes?

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:58.738
What connection? All juvenile records
are destroyed after seven years.

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:02.546
We were never at Wilkinson's.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.712
We gotta go after the guards.
I gotta get Wilkinson's.

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:10.055
Bring it all down.

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:13.686
Adam Styler. Plainclothes cop,
works narcotics in Queens.

01:12:13.762 --> 01:12:15.889
Known to shake down dealers
for dope and cash.

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:19.263
He's got a cocaine problem.
Other personal information there.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:22.771
Henry Addison. Now works for the mayor,
if you can fuckin' believe that.

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:24.772
He's a community outreach director
in Brooklyn.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.243
Sexual habits haven't changed.
Still likes sex with young boys.

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:32.872
Ralph Ferguson. Works in
a social service agency in Long Island.

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:34.279
How long you been
workin' on this, Mike?

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:35.715
Recently divorced,
got one child...

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:38.685
and on weekends
teaches Catholic Sunday school.

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:40.244
Seems clean, then. Right?

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:42.882
That's exactly why
I want the piece of shit.

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:45.654
Plan is to call Ferguson in
as a character witness.

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:48.629
Get him talkin'
about his best friend Sean Nokes.

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:52.531
Once I got him on the stand,
I'm gonna open the door to Wilkinson's.

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:55.999
Mike...

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:58.005
Sure you wanna go this way?

01:13:00.809 --> 01:13:03.744
I mean, we buried this
a long time ago.

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.947
You still sleep
with the light on?

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:15.748
John and Tommy? You want them
to know anything about this?

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:18.292
Nah. It'll play better in court
if they don't know.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:31.737
A <i>"</i> not guilty" verdict...

01:13:31.807 --> 01:13:34.037
had to be a verdict that no one
would dare to question.

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:37.044
Danny Snyder was to remain
as Tommy and John's attorney.

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:40.739
Michael's plan relied heavily
on Hell's Kitchen...

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:43.080
to deliver information
and keep quiet.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:45.985
Both were skills
the neighborhood had in abundance.

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:48.318
We'd set up a simple
method of communication.

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:50.756
If Michael was sending,
messages were left at work...

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:53.351
for me to call
my non-existent girlfriend, Gloria.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:55.363
If I needed
to get word to Michael...

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.262
I would have
someone from the neighborhood...

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:59.323
pick up an early edition
of <i>The New York Times</i>...

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:02.598
write <i>"</i> Edmund" in the upper right
hand corner of the Metro section...

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:04.901
and drop it
in front of Michael's apartment.

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:11.904
For this plan to succeed,
we needed total secrecy...

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.346
and the only people
we completely trusted.

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:16.281
The plan depended
on keeping Michael alive...

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:19.013
which meant that word had to get
toJohn and Tommy's killing crew...

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:20.918
that he was not an open target.

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:24.322
After this night, Michael
would not be available to any of us.

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:27.191
The only time we would see him
would be in court.

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:29.787
- That's it?
- Not quite.

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:32.561
We got four witnesses who saw
the shooting and are willing to testify.

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:34.226
I gotta get that number down.

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:37.534
- I'll talk to King Benny.
- Good.

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:39.437
I can handle two, but, uh...

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:41.169
you gotta get us
one for our side.

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:43.973
- One what?
- One witness.

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:45.513
A witness
who'll putJohn and Tommy...

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:48.015
somewhere else
on the night of the murder.

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:50.984
A witness they can't touch.

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:55.149
- Don't they got a name for that?
- Judge would call it <i>"</i> perjury."

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:58.216
Nice. And what are we callin' it?

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:00.227
A favor.

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:05.494
Get up! Come on!

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:09.067
- Tony?
- Yeah, King?

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:11.503
Bring Danny Snyder to see me.

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:15.270
- Danny Snyder the lawyer?
- You know more than one Danny Snyder?

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.744
- No, King.
- Bring me the one you know.

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:38.828
I can't do this now,
and you gotta know that.

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:42.029
It's been a long time for me.
I mean, uh...

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:47.003
You need somebody younger.
You know, somebody like I used to be.

01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:48.906
Younger is not better.

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:52.640
Doesn't have experience, doesn't
know its way around a courthouse.

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:54.705
Hey, I'm lucky
I can find the courthouse.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:59.016
I had only four cases last year.

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.554
You know how many I won?

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:03.591
None. That's how many. None.

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:06.589
In two of them, l-l, uh...

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:09.756
I think the, uh, the jury
blamed me personally.

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:11.765
They must have been innocent.

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:15.896
It's tough to get innocent men
off a rap.

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:18.269
I wasn't even planning
on going to court with this one.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.332
I was just gonna plead it down
best I could and walk away.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:24.402
I wasn't... I wasn't planning
on taking this to trial, sir.

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:27.414
Well, your plans have been changed.

01:16:27.482 --> 01:16:30.974
Well, I am afraid that I'll make
a mistake and say the wrong thing...

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:34.648
and, you know, uh, uh, uh,
make a wrong turn somewhere...

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:36.418
and you don't wanna take that risk.

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:38.959
- Life is risk.
- I'm sorry?

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:43.054
- Life is risk.
- Life is a risk.

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:45.622
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:50.500
I haven't been in here before.

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:53.166
- What do you need me to do?
- Listen.

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:56.836
You're gonna be given
the answers and the questions.

01:16:58.013 --> 01:17:00.038
All you have to do is read.

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:01.776
You can read, can't you?

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:03.818
Uh, is it, uh, it's...
l-Is it English?

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:08.447
Just don't drift, don't drink,
and don't lose.

01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:09.854
What if I do lose?

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:12.655
Then you go down
for the dirt nap.

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:15.697
Never heard that expression before.

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:20.358
Dirt nap.

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:22.596
I'm not really
cut out for this anymore.

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:26.300
I mean, a guy gets hit by a bus,
you know, and sues.

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:27.672
l-I like that.

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:30.871
Some lady, uh, slips in a supermarket.

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:33.574
- I'm with her. A guy...
- The discussion's over.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:37.642
I'm an alcoholic. This is a murder case.
This isn't for me.

01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:40.085
- It was once.
- Yes, but...

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:43.318
Before you let the drink lead.

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:45.223
Be sober by tomorrow...

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:47.454
and don't look so worried, Snyder.

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:50.327
You got nothing to lose,
just like the rest of us.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:54.893
I don't want to be a burden to you,
but I do... You know, aside...

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:58.997
Or along with my alcohol problem,
I have a-a-a slight drug problem.

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:01.099
I mean, n-nothing big, just...

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.440
Go away.

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:14.417
Within days
of Michael taking the case...

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:17.356
the West Side Boys
got a visit from King Benny.

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:21.226
The king requested that the verbal abuse
directed towards Michael continue.

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:24.595
Cries of <i>"</i> traitor" and <i>"</i> gutter rat"
were heard up and down the avenue...

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:27.100
but there was never
to be a death move against him.

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:29.660
The hit on Michael Sullivan,
if there was to be one...

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:31.638
could only come from King Benny.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:34.198
The underground word...
the only one that mattered...

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:37.040
had spread through the streets
with the speed of a late-night bullet.

01:18:41.516 --> 01:18:44.485
King Benny's sleepers
were making their play.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.043
<i>"</i> Sleepers" was a street name...

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:48.954
for anyone who spent time
in a juvenile facility.

01:18:58.366 --> 01:19:00.994
Hey! You gonna pay for that,
you little prick?

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:05.870
I need your help, Fat Man.
I need a big favor. Be outside.

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:08.501
- King Benny been to see you?
- Oh, my goodness.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:11.137
What a fucking thing
we put together, huh?

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:13.909
You have a drunk lawyer
on one side...

01:19:13.982 --> 01:19:15.813
a kid lawyer on the other...

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:19.411
Fucking paperboy
making like Dick Tracy.

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:23.424
There are four sets of eyeballs
that saw the whole thing. You know?

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:26.620
Meanwhile, the two on trial
killed more people than cancer.

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:28.993
Fucking General Custer
has a better shot at a walk.

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:30.861
There's no connection
with the guard and us.

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:32.729
The cops think
it's a drug-related homicide.

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:34.962
It's just we need you
to pull a few strings, Fat Man.

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:38.335
Dude, you get caught on this,
you're lookin' straight-ass serious.

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:41.102
I'm talking real jail.
The big house.

01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:45.246
Hey, Mike.

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:50.643
They are not good boys anymore.

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.812
They're killers now.

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:55.721
Cold as stone.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.190
I know.

01:19:57.259 --> 01:19:58.920
I know what they were
and I know what they are.

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.484
And it's not about that.

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:02.962
It's not worth it,
throwing away a life...

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:05.499
just to get even.

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:07.626
You and the lawyer
have a chance to get out...

01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:09.226
to get out the right way.

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:12.137
There's no choice.
Not for us.

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.878
On occasion,
I'd have dinner with Carol.

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:22.315
She still lived in the neighborhood and
was a social worker in the South Bronx.

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:25.512
Her concern for us
was undiminished by the passing years.

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:27.077
Whenever we went out as a group...

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:31.717
Carol would walk between Michael
and John, grasping their arms...

01:20:31.793 --> 01:20:33.920
in step between
the lawyer and the killer.

01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:36.122
Mug me or marry me, Shakes.

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:38.826
I'm too tired for anything else.

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:42.802
Would you settle
for a couple beers, Carol?

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.702
If that's your best offer.

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:48.666
I'll throw in a hug and a kiss.

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:50.540
Deal.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:58.847
- You look tired.
- Thank you.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.286
They don't give you time to sleep
in this new job of yours?

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:05.986
<i>What a very special time for me</i>

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:08.427
So how much do you know?

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:11.056
Just what the neighborhood says...

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:13.896
or what I read
in papers like yours.

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:15.561
What does the neighborhood say?

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:17.628
That they're gonna
putJohnny and Tommy away.

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:19.970
That their best friend's
gonna be the one to do it.

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.805
- You believe that?
- It's hard not to, Shakes.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.812
Unless we all have it wrong.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.610
He did take the fuckin' case.

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:29.946
- He did take the case.
- What else is there to say?

01:21:32.754 --> 01:21:34.847
You know Michael very well.

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:36.857
Maybe even better than I do.

01:21:36.925 --> 01:21:39.359
Yeah, I thought I did.
Now I don't know.

01:21:39.427 --> 01:21:41.918
- You do know.
- I don't know!

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:43.658
He went in there
and he asked for the case.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:46.792
Now you tell me.
What the hell kind of friend is that?

01:21:46.868 --> 01:21:49.098
The best kind.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:51.934
The kind that'd throw away everything
to help his friends.

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:57.544
What are you tellin' me, Shakes?

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.309
You know this neighborhood, Carol.

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:04.182
Everything's a shakedown or a scam.
Why should this be any different?

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:13.025
I'm hungry.

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:16.029
I'm gonna get somethin' to eat.

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:18.156
There's this point in Michael...

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:20.258
that you can't go beyond.

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:21.768
I mean, you can try.

01:22:21.836 --> 01:22:23.463
I tried...

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:26.905
and he just shut down.

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:30.706
Couldn't touch him.
Couldn't even breathe on him.

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:35.215
I thought it was me.

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:39.944
After a while,
it just gets easy to let it go.

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:43.149
- You still love him?
- I don't think about it, Shakes.

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:47.059
If I did, I'd say <i>"</i> yes."

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:48.891
But you're with John now.

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:54.266
Yeah. As much as anybody
can be with John.

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:57.568
The man I know
is not the boy you remember.

01:22:57.639 --> 01:23:00.073
None of us are.

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:02.609
But there's somethin' special
aboutJohn.

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:06.813
You just have to look
a little harder to see it.

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:09.247
Yeah.

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:13.186
Why didn't you ever ask me out?

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:15.722
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:18.750
'Cause you were Mikey's girl.

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:23.459
- He got to you first.
- And after Mikey?

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:27.594
- I think it was Tommy's turn.
- Oh, fuck you!

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:32.131
I don't know. It was, uh...

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:37.271
l-I didn't think
you'd say yes, and, uh...

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:44.910
Well, you were wrong, Shakes.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.454
You were wrong.

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:55.824
What? Go ahead, say it.

01:23:56.965 --> 01:23:58.227
You work at social services.

01:23:58.299 --> 01:24:00.529
You got files...
You got access to files...

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.934
and from time to time
we're gonna need some information.

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:05.598
Yeah. Sure. Whatever.

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:07.868
Wait. What?

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:09.671
What? What do you want?
Y-You want information?

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:11.473
Y-You want me to get the files,
I get the files.

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:14.811
- No, I didn't want. I didn't...
- What do you want?

01:24:20.088 --> 01:24:22.056
You still visitJohn?

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:23.920
Yeah. Once a week
for about an hour.

01:24:23.992 --> 01:24:26.222
- Good.
- Good?

01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:29.786
Yeah, good. Just don't tell him
that you've seen me.

01:24:29.864 --> 01:24:31.024
Don't tell him anything.

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:34.091
The more he thinks this thing's
hopeless, the better it might work.

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:38.594
Shakes, what is this about?

01:24:39.506 --> 01:24:42.805
If you want a Rolls-Royce,
you don't come here.

01:24:42.876 --> 01:24:45.743
You go to England
or wherever the fuck they make it.

01:24:45.812 --> 01:24:47.780
If you want champagne,
you go see the French.

01:24:47.847 --> 01:24:50.042
If you need money,
you find a Jew.

01:24:50.116 --> 01:24:54.052
But if you want dirt or scum
buried under a rock somewhere...

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.554
or some secret nobody
wants anybody to know about...

01:24:56.623 --> 01:25:00.059
there's only one place to go...
right here, Hell's Kitchen.

01:25:00.126 --> 01:25:03.220
It is the lost and found of shit.

01:25:03.296 --> 01:25:06.595
They lose it and we find it.
Forget about it, man.

01:25:07.901 --> 01:25:11.598
Now you only got two witnesses
who are gonna testify.

01:25:12.439 --> 01:25:16.102
- Two others changed their minds.
- Which two?

01:25:16.176 --> 01:25:19.373
The suits at the bar.

01:25:19.446 --> 01:25:21.744
So that still leaves
the couple in the booth.

01:25:21.815 --> 01:25:24.579
For now.

01:25:24.651 --> 01:25:27.586
Everything else fallin' into place?

01:25:27.654 --> 01:25:30.145
Except for your witness.

01:25:30.223 --> 01:25:32.783
That pocket's still empty.

01:25:32.859 --> 01:25:34.793
I know.

01:25:38.231 --> 01:25:41.029
When you were sent away...

01:25:41.101 --> 01:25:43.968
I was always sorry
I couldn't do more for you.

01:25:52.412 --> 01:25:54.937
I didn't know
you liked pigeons so much.

01:25:55.015 --> 01:25:57.848
I like anything that don't talk.

01:25:58.685 --> 01:26:01.711
Michael's vision of where he wanted
this case to go was very clear.

01:26:01.788 --> 01:26:03.722
He was aiming for guilty...

01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:06.258
a charge of guilty against
the Wilkinson Home for Boys...

01:26:06.326 --> 01:26:10.729
against Sean Nokes, Adam Styler,
Henry Addison and Ralph Ferguson.

01:26:10.797 --> 01:26:14.631
I will present you evidence and offer
into account testimony to prove that.

01:26:14.701 --> 01:26:16.760
I will place him
at the scene of the crime.

01:26:16.836 --> 01:26:19.828
I will bring witnesses to the stand
who will confirm...

01:26:19.906 --> 01:26:22.272
that they were there
on that deadly night.

01:26:22.342 --> 01:26:25.971
I will present enough evidence
that you can then go into a jury room...

01:26:26.046 --> 01:26:29.709
and come back with a clear decision
that's beyond a reasonable doubt.

01:26:30.617 --> 01:26:34.383
I'm sure you all know what that means,
since you probably watch as much
television as I do.

01:26:37.424 --> 01:26:39.824
John. John Reilly...

01:26:39.893 --> 01:26:43.226
and Thomas Marcano are two
innocent pawns quickly arrested...

01:26:43.296 --> 01:26:47.926
and just, uh, as,
uh, quickly prosecuted...

01:26:48.001 --> 01:26:50.731
on the slightest threads of evidence.

01:26:50.804 --> 01:26:53.739
On the bright side,
he seems to know their names.

01:27:05.385 --> 01:27:07.751
It's nice when you come around.

01:27:10.123 --> 01:27:13.115
Hey, bring me another spoon.
This one's dirty.

01:27:13.193 --> 01:27:15.684
- Take it.
- No, no. She'll do it.

01:27:24.504 --> 01:27:26.438
So how's work?

01:27:28.108 --> 01:27:30.042
I'm still there.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:38.975
You know, Pop, l, uh...
I went down to the courthouse.

01:27:39.052 --> 01:27:40.986
John and Tommy...
I saw John and Tommy...

01:27:41.054 --> 01:27:44.182
and, uh, suddenly I started
thinking back to when we...

01:27:44.257 --> 01:27:46.191
Well, where's the chicken?

01:27:49.596 --> 01:27:52.360
So?

01:27:52.432 --> 01:27:56.869
Nothin'.
I was just thinkin' things.

01:27:56.936 --> 01:27:59.632
But you're doin' good, right?

01:27:59.706 --> 01:28:02.174
Oh, yeah. I'm good.

01:28:02.242 --> 01:28:04.176
Good.

01:28:46.052 --> 01:28:48.543
- What the hell do these things do?
- They're for praying.

01:28:48.621 --> 01:28:52.819
Just look at all this shit.
Does your mother think you're
in the fuckin' army or somethin'?

01:28:52.892 --> 01:28:56.419
- Ain't none of it on the approved list.
- Sure your mommy got a copy
of that list?

01:28:56.496 --> 01:28:58.123
My mother
can't speak English that well.

01:28:58.198 --> 01:29:01.463
Oh, don't blame us for your fuckin'
mother bein' stupid, all right?

01:29:06.539 --> 01:29:09.133
When are you gonna let us
hear you pray?

01:29:19.385 --> 01:29:21.512
Maybe he needs somethin'
to pray for.

01:29:21.588 --> 01:29:25.354
Put your hands on the table
and lay 'em down flat.

01:29:25.425 --> 01:29:27.859
Spread your legs.

01:29:27.927 --> 01:29:31.727
Start thinkin' up some prayers.

01:29:40.039 --> 01:29:43.497
- We don't hear no prayin'.
- You better start, else Styler
might lose his baton up your ass.

01:29:43.576 --> 01:29:47.706
Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy wombJesus.

01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:50.749
- Pray nice and loud.
- Hail Mary, full of grace...

01:29:50.817 --> 01:29:52.682
Now louder!

01:29:52.752 --> 01:29:54.845
Fuckin' pray! Come on now!

01:29:56.589 --> 01:29:59.581
- Louder!
- Can't hear you!

01:30:00.059 --> 01:30:01.720
Louder, fucker!

01:30:03.596 --> 01:30:05.757
Pray till your balls hurt!

01:30:08.768 --> 01:30:10.395
Louder!

01:30:16.376 --> 01:30:18.844
Sorry I'm late.
I lost all track of time.

01:30:18.911 --> 01:30:21.436
I got this idea for a witness,
but I'm not quite sure yet.

01:30:21.514 --> 01:30:24.745
But I wanted you to come along
so you could see it.

01:30:26.052 --> 01:30:28.213
- Where are we going?
- To his place.

01:30:28.288 --> 01:30:30.222
- Where is it?
- He's in the rectory.

01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:34.226
No, Shakes. I can't...

01:30:40.533 --> 01:30:43.195
How was court today?

01:30:43.269 --> 01:30:47.638
Like the first round of a fight...
everybody just feelin' each other out.

01:30:48.975 --> 01:30:51.136
How did the boys look?

01:30:51.210 --> 01:30:53.303
Like they wished
they was someplace else.

01:30:54.814 --> 01:30:57.840
It's the sheep that stray
that you most want back.

01:30:59.552 --> 01:31:01.577
It's not too late, Father.

01:31:03.756 --> 01:31:07.419
We still have a chance to bring in
a couple of stray sheep.

01:31:07.493 --> 01:31:09.427
One more chance.

01:31:11.164 --> 01:31:13.098
Is that chance legal?

01:31:14.834 --> 01:31:16.859
Last chances never are.

01:31:16.936 --> 01:31:19.803
King Benny behind this?

01:31:19.872 --> 01:31:23.137
He's in on it, but, uh,
he's not callin' the shots.

01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:26.269
- Who is?
- Michael.

01:31:28.348 --> 01:31:30.612
I should've smelled it.

01:31:30.683 --> 01:31:33.584
The minute he went for the case,
I should've figured somethin' was up.

01:31:33.653 --> 01:31:36.918
It's a good plan.
Michael's got it all covered.

01:31:36.989 --> 01:31:40.083
Just about every base you look at,
he... he's got it covered.

01:31:40.159 --> 01:31:42.491
Not every base.

01:31:42.562 --> 01:31:44.826
You're short something,
or else you wouldn't be here.

01:31:44.897 --> 01:31:46.990
You don't shit a shitter, right?

01:31:47.066 --> 01:31:49.000
That's right.

01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:54.097
So what is it?
Where do you come up short?

01:31:55.308 --> 01:31:59.711
Witness. We need
somebody to take the stand...

01:31:59.779 --> 01:32:02.247
and say they were with John and Tommy
on the night of the murder.

01:32:02.315 --> 01:32:04.647
So you figured if you had a priest,
it would be perfect.

01:32:05.551 --> 01:32:08.281
Not just any priest.

01:32:19.065 --> 01:32:21.363
So you're...

01:32:23.403 --> 01:32:26.702
you're asking me...

01:32:26.773 --> 01:32:29.537
you're asking me to lie.

01:32:29.609 --> 01:32:32.976
You're asking me to swear to God
and then lie.

01:32:33.045 --> 01:32:35.912
I'm asking you to save
two of your boys.

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:45.357
- Did they kill that guard?
- Yes.

01:32:45.425 --> 01:32:49.418
So what they said is true.
They walked in and they killed him.

01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:53.363
Yes.

01:32:53.433 --> 01:32:56.061
They killed him exactly like that.

01:32:59.172 --> 01:33:01.265
I think I need a drink.

01:33:02.909 --> 01:33:05.901
Anyone want a drink?

01:33:05.978 --> 01:33:07.775
Yeah.

01:33:22.528 --> 01:33:24.860
This is some favor
you're asking me.

01:33:25.765 --> 01:33:30.293
- We know that.
- No, I don't think you do know.

01:33:31.304 --> 01:33:33.602
You said if there was ever
anything really important...

01:33:33.673 --> 01:33:36.039
I could come to you, ask you.

01:33:36.108 --> 01:33:40.010
I was thinking more
along the lines of Yankee tickets.

01:33:41.214 --> 01:33:46.618
I don't need Yankee tickets, Father.
I need a witness.

01:33:47.487 --> 01:33:51.150
What about the life that was taken,
Shakes? What's that worth?

01:33:51.224 --> 01:33:54.819
To me? Nothing.

01:33:56.496 --> 01:33:59.693
Why not? Tell me.

01:34:05.471 --> 01:34:08.338
He was a...

01:34:08.407 --> 01:34:11.171
He was a guard at Wilkinson's.

01:34:13.579 --> 01:34:15.012
All right?

01:34:15.081 --> 01:34:17.015
If Father Bobby
was gonna be involved...

01:34:17.083 --> 01:34:19.313
he deserved to know
what he was getting into.

01:34:19.385 --> 01:34:22.320
If he wasn't, I trusted that the
truth would go no further than his room.

01:34:23.890 --> 01:34:26.484
I thought that Carol
needed to know as well.

01:34:26.559 --> 01:34:28.493
Jesus Christ,
we were just boys.

01:34:28.561 --> 01:34:30.529
We weren't that tough.

01:34:33.466 --> 01:34:35.661
They held us down.

01:34:38.571 --> 01:34:42.803
I told him about the torture,
the beatings and the rapes.

01:34:42.875 --> 01:34:45.036
I told him about
the four frightened boys...

01:34:45.111 --> 01:34:48.410
who prayed to Father Bobby's god
for help that never came.

01:34:48.481 --> 01:34:50.312
I told him everything.

01:34:50.383 --> 01:34:52.442
And you can't...
you can't fight anymore.

01:34:52.518 --> 01:34:56.921
You just took it all.
John used to wail at night.

01:34:56.989 --> 01:35:00.049
You'd hear it
all the way down the hall.

01:35:01.627 --> 01:35:04.858
You know he wanted to be a priest.
John wanted to be a priest.

01:35:16.375 --> 01:35:18.502
I just sort of blacked out,
but what I could remember...

01:35:18.578 --> 01:35:20.876
is that I couldn't even breathe.

01:35:22.381 --> 01:35:24.713
I started to choke...

01:35:29.322 --> 01:35:31.415
Then I blacked out.

01:35:33.059 --> 01:35:35.926
But I do remember when...
when, for fun...

01:35:35.995 --> 01:35:38.589
they'd take us down in the basement...

01:35:38.664 --> 01:35:42.122
and tie two or three of us
together and watch.

01:36:00.219 --> 01:36:03.017
I got a decision to make.

01:36:06.692 --> 01:36:09.092
I only pray it's the right one.

01:36:10.262 --> 01:36:14.164
It will be, Father,
whichever way you go.

01:36:19.705 --> 01:36:21.639
Good night.

01:36:29.615 --> 01:36:33.244
Okay, so you were sitting down,
you were having dinner...

01:36:33.319 --> 01:36:35.913
- And two men entered McHale's, correct?
- Yes.

01:36:35.988 --> 01:36:39.151
Did you see the two men
as they approached the table
where Mr. Nokes was sitting?

01:36:39.225 --> 01:36:41.284
l-I noticed it, yes.

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:44.295
- Did you hear
what was said between them?
- Um, no.

01:36:44.363 --> 01:36:46.729
- Did you see them pull out their guns?
- No.

01:36:46.799 --> 01:36:50.565
- Did you hear the shots?
- Yes, I heard the shots.

01:36:50.636 --> 01:36:54.902
And what did they do? What was their
behavior after... after the shooting?

01:36:55.941 --> 01:36:58.967
They walked out of McHale's
as if nothing had happened.

01:36:59.045 --> 01:37:04.108
And at that time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you see their faces clearly?

01:37:04.817 --> 01:37:08.548
Yes. I looked up
as they walked away.

01:37:08.621 --> 01:37:11.454
- Are you positive?
- Yes. Very positive.

01:37:11.524 --> 01:37:14.322
And are the two men you saw in McHale's,
are they in this room today?

01:37:14.393 --> 01:37:17.692
- Yes, they are.
- Could you point them out
for the jury, please?

01:37:18.798 --> 01:37:21.358
They're sitting right over there.

01:37:21.434 --> 01:37:24.835
Your Honor, will the record reflect
that Mrs. Salinas has identified...

01:37:24.904 --> 01:37:29.102
defendants John Reilly and Thomas
Marcano as the two men in question.

01:37:29.175 --> 01:37:31.973
- Noted.
- Thank you. No further questions.

01:37:32.378 --> 01:37:35.575
Counsel, are you ready to proceed?

01:37:35.648 --> 01:37:38.173
Yes, Your Honor, we are.
Good morning.

01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:42.482
I just have a few questions.
I won't take too much
of your time, Mrs. Salinas.

01:37:42.555 --> 01:37:46.685
Uh, you stated that, uh, you
only had wine to drink with dinner.

01:37:46.759 --> 01:37:48.693
- Is that correct?
- Yes.
- Are you sure about that?

01:37:48.761 --> 01:37:53.130
Are you sure that's all you had...
one, uh, bottle of wine?

01:37:53.199 --> 01:37:55.497
- Yes. A bottle of red Chianti.
- Uh-huh.

01:37:55.568 --> 01:37:58.560
Had you anything to drink,
uh, prior to that?

01:37:58.637 --> 01:38:02.300
- What do you mean, prior?
- At, uh, uh, lunch.

01:38:02.374 --> 01:38:04.638
Maybe did you have anything
to drink at lunch?

01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:07.702
- Yes, I did.
- And, uh, what did you have to drink?

01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:10.044
I went shopping, and l, um...

01:38:10.116 --> 01:38:12.550
I stopped at a place
on Madison Avenue for some...

01:38:12.618 --> 01:38:15.587
See, I didn't ask you where you went.
I asked you what you had
to drink at lunch.

01:38:16.655 --> 01:38:18.919
- A martini.
- And what else?

01:38:20.826 --> 01:38:23.693
Um, probably some wine.

01:38:23.763 --> 01:38:29.201
Yes, and how... Uh, how many, uh,
glasses of wine did you have to drink?

01:38:29.268 --> 01:38:32.499
Um, one-one glass, maybe two.

01:38:33.172 --> 01:38:37.074
- Closer to two?
- Yes. Probably two glasses. About two.

01:38:37.143 --> 01:38:41.546
And did you, uh, uh...

01:38:42.214 --> 01:38:44.273
It's like pulling teeth.

01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:46.079
Uh...

01:38:46.152 --> 01:38:49.019
I should've pinned
the questions to his shirt.

01:38:49.088 --> 01:38:53.286
And, uh, tell me, uh,
then at dinner, you, uh...

01:38:53.359 --> 01:38:56.760
Uh... Strike that. Uh...

01:38:58.764 --> 01:39:01.232
Uh, uh...

01:39:03.102 --> 01:39:05.627
What time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you have lunch?

01:39:05.704 --> 01:39:08.172
Objection, Your Honor.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.640
What Mrs. Salinas did
on the day of the murder...

01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:12.973
has nothing to do with what
she saw on the night of the murder.

01:39:13.045 --> 01:39:15.980
- How much she had
to drink does, Your Honor.
- Overruled.

01:39:17.917 --> 01:39:21.375
Mrs. Salinas, what time,
uh, did you have lunch?

01:39:21.453 --> 01:39:24.752
- About 1:30.
- And what did you have for lunch?

01:39:24.824 --> 01:39:27.952
It was a while ago.
Um, probably a salad.

01:39:28.027 --> 01:39:30.427
l-I like to eat
a little light in the day.

01:39:30.496 --> 01:39:32.794
A martini, two glasses of wine
and a salad.

01:39:32.865 --> 01:39:35.390
- Is that correct?
- Yes. That's right.

01:39:35.467 --> 01:39:39.130
And then you had wine at dinner
about six hours later.

01:39:39.205 --> 01:39:41.696
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's right.

01:39:41.774 --> 01:39:45.608
How much wine did you have to drink
by the time my clients
allegedly walked into McHale's?

01:39:45.678 --> 01:39:48.613
- Two glasses.
- Would you say that, uh...

01:39:48.681 --> 01:39:52.845
four glasses of wine and a martini
within a six-hour period...

01:39:52.918 --> 01:39:55.978
- Is a lot for you to drink?
- Yes, it is. Yes.

01:39:56.055 --> 01:39:58.751
Uh-huh. Sure.

01:39:58.824 --> 01:40:02.282
Uh... And, uh...

01:40:02.361 --> 01:40:07.060
had you ever heard a gun fired
prior to the night in question?

01:40:07.132 --> 01:40:09.293
No.

01:40:09.368 --> 01:40:11.962
Uh, how would you
describe the sound?

01:40:12.037 --> 01:40:14.471
It's loud,
like fireworks loud.

01:40:15.908 --> 01:40:20.174
- Did the sound, uh, frighten you?
- Very much.

01:40:20.246 --> 01:40:22.806
Did you close your...
uh, your eyes?

01:40:24.016 --> 01:40:27.850
At first, um, until the shooting
stopped, then I opened them.

01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:31.651
Did you think the men who did
the shooting were going to kill
everybody in McHale's?

01:40:31.724 --> 01:40:33.783
Well, l-I really didn't know
what to think.

01:40:33.859 --> 01:40:36.020
l-I just knew
that a man had been shot.

01:40:36.095 --> 01:40:40.964
Did you think you might be shot dead
by the two cold-blooded killers?

01:40:41.567 --> 01:40:43.330
Yes. Yes, I did.

01:40:43.402 --> 01:40:47.634
Yet, despite that fear,
despite that, uh, risk to your life...

01:40:47.706 --> 01:40:52.200
you looked at their faces,
uh, as they left?

01:40:52.278 --> 01:40:54.405
- Yes, I did.
- Is that correct?

01:40:55.848 --> 01:40:58.646
- Yes, I did.
- Did you look at their faces?

01:40:58.717 --> 01:41:03.984
Did you really, really look,
Mrs. Salinas?

01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:07.686
I glanced at them when they walked by,
but I did see them.

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:12.026
You glanced. You didn't look.

01:41:13.065 --> 01:41:15.124
I saw them.

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:18.101
You glanced at them,
Mrs. Salinas.

01:41:18.170 --> 01:41:21.970
You glanced at them through the eyes
of a very frightened woman...

01:41:22.041 --> 01:41:25.340
who maybe had too much to drink.

01:41:25.411 --> 01:41:27.208
Objection, Your Honor.

01:41:27.279 --> 01:41:30.112
There is no need, Your Honor.
I have no further questions.

01:41:30.182 --> 01:41:32.946
Thank you, Mrs. Salinas.
You may step down.

01:41:36.388 --> 01:41:38.879
It was 6:15 on Sunday morning.

01:41:38.958 --> 01:41:42.155
Frank Magcicco worked
out of a homicide unit in Brooklyn.

01:41:42.227 --> 01:41:45.856
He was a first-rate detective with
an honest name and a solid reputation.

01:41:45.931 --> 01:41:48.365
He was also King Benny's nephew.

01:41:48.434 --> 01:41:51.335
Nick Davenport
was with internal affairs.

01:41:51.403 --> 01:41:54.429
He was ambitious and wanted
to make captain before he hit 40.

01:41:54.506 --> 01:41:56.531
He knew the fastest way up the track
was to reel in...

01:41:56.608 --> 01:42:00.203
a maximum amount of dirty cops
in a minimum amount of time.

01:42:00.279 --> 01:42:02.304
- Frank, what is this shit?
- Hey, I were you...

01:42:02.381 --> 01:42:04.849
I'd do what the kid says.
You make this one...

01:42:04.917 --> 01:42:07.385
you're gonna be having breakfast
once a month with the commissioner.

01:42:07.453 --> 01:42:10.251
Man, you got a real hard-on
for this style of guy, huh?

01:42:10.322 --> 01:42:12.517
- What's your beef with him?
- One more thing.

01:42:12.591 --> 01:42:15.059
- I can't wait.
- It's simple.

01:42:15.127 --> 01:42:17.425
No one knows if I give you
this information.

01:42:17.496 --> 01:42:19.430
- And I mean nobody.
- How did you get it?

01:42:19.498 --> 01:42:23.093
It fell into my lap,
just like it's gonna fall into yours.

01:42:30.142 --> 01:42:32.235
Christ almighty!

01:42:38.917 --> 01:42:42.580
- Got everything in here
but a confession.
- I thought I'd leave that up to you.

01:42:42.654 --> 01:42:46.317
- My preference is
that you beat it out of him.
- There's even surveillance photos.

01:42:46.392 --> 01:42:49.987
This piece of shit's pullin' in about
five grand a month rippin' off pushers.

01:42:50.062 --> 01:42:52.895
- Has been for about three years.
- More like four.

01:42:52.965 --> 01:42:55.126
- He ain't gonna see five.
- So you got enough for a conviction?

01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:57.430
That ain't up to me.
That's up to a jury.

01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:04.109
Show the jury this.

01:43:04.176 --> 01:43:08.374
- Well, what do you got there, Ness?
- About three weeks ago...

01:43:08.447 --> 01:43:10.847
the body of a drug dealer
named Indian Red Lopez...

01:43:10.916 --> 01:43:12.850
was found in an alley
in Jackson Heights...

01:43:12.918 --> 01:43:15.318
three bullets in his head,
nothing in his pockets.

01:43:15.387 --> 01:43:17.855
- I'm with you so far.
- This is the gun that killed him...

01:43:17.923 --> 01:43:19.857
and these are the shells.

01:43:19.925 --> 01:43:22.723
And, uh, what's behind
door number three?

01:43:23.295 --> 01:43:25.855
The prints on the gun
belong to Adam Styler.

01:43:29.635 --> 01:43:32.365
- Hey, do me a favor, would you?
- What's that?

01:43:32.438 --> 01:43:35.134
If I ever make it onto your shit list,
give me a call.

01:43:35.207 --> 01:43:37.607
Give me a chance to apologize.

01:43:37.676 --> 01:43:40.008
So, you need anything else,
you talk to Frank.

01:43:40.079 --> 01:43:43.674
- He knows how to get a hold of me.
- Take care of yourself, kid.

01:43:43.749 --> 01:43:46.877
- The water gets choppy out your way.
- I'll do what I can.

01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:52.423
Hey, Ness. Did you ever think
of becomin' a cop?

01:43:52.491 --> 01:43:54.425
And leave the good guys?

01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:06.767
The body of Christ.

01:44:08.373 --> 01:44:11.536
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

01:44:11.610 --> 01:44:13.737
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

01:44:15.747 --> 01:44:18.215
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

01:44:20.018 --> 01:44:22.384
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

01:44:22.454 --> 01:44:25.014
The body of Chri...

01:44:33.332 --> 01:44:35.232
Amen.

01:44:37.569 --> 01:44:39.867
The body of Christ.

01:44:42.374 --> 01:44:44.934
Michael had done
all that could be expected...

01:44:45.010 --> 01:44:48.241
of an assistant district attorney
seeking a conviction.

01:44:48.313 --> 01:44:51.282
He had a forensic expert
detail the make and caliber...

01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:53.409
of the gun that killed Nokes.

01:44:53.485 --> 01:44:55.976
He just never had the murder weapon
to present as evidence...

01:44:56.054 --> 01:44:59.512
and he never gave the jury
a motive for the murder.

01:44:59.591 --> 01:45:02.526
The tension of his task,
the hours he was working...

01:45:02.594 --> 01:45:05.427
and the uncertainty about the outcome
weighed heavily on him.

01:45:05.497 --> 01:45:08.295
- Did you see their faces?
- Yes. I looked at them...

01:45:08.367 --> 01:45:11.302
- And they looked at me.
- Did they say anything to you?

01:45:11.370 --> 01:45:13.736
No. They just looked at me
and walked out of McHale's.

01:45:13.805 --> 01:45:16.069
Are you sure the two defendants
killed Sean Nokes?

01:45:16.141 --> 01:45:17.938
I know they killed him.

01:45:18.010 --> 01:45:21.138
If the plan worked,
it would be everyone's success.

01:45:21.213 --> 01:45:23.738
If it failed, the fault
would fall on Michael.

01:45:23.815 --> 01:45:25.476
Oh, boy, man!

01:45:26.585 --> 01:45:30.954
Father Bobby Carillo, the priest with
the best hook shot on the west side...

01:45:31.023 --> 01:45:35.016
remained the key to a plan
that called for all involved
to get away with murder.

01:45:35.093 --> 01:45:38.824
Did you turn around, look behind you
when you heard the shooting, Mr. Carson?

01:45:38.897 --> 01:45:42.230
- Why-Why didn't you
turn around, Mr. Carson?
- I was concerned for my...

01:45:42.301 --> 01:45:46.863
- Mr. Carson, did the two individuals
threaten you in any way?
- No.

01:45:46.939 --> 01:45:51.501
Did they threaten anyone in
McHale's Restaurant as far as you know?

01:45:51.577 --> 01:45:53.511
I didn't see it, but I know it.

01:45:53.579 --> 01:45:56.047
If you didn't see the defendants
shoot the guys...

01:45:56.114 --> 01:45:59.675
then how do you know it was
the defendants that shot the guy?

01:46:21.873 --> 01:46:23.864
So what's the emergency?

01:46:27.479 --> 01:46:29.743
You know, Shakes shouldn't
have sent you. It's too risky.

01:46:29.815 --> 01:46:33.080
Hey, nobody sent me.
I wanted to see you.

01:46:35.187 --> 01:46:37.781
Why?

01:46:37.856 --> 01:46:40.848
Shakes met with Father Bobby
two weeks ago.

01:46:40.926 --> 01:46:45.329
- He hasn't heard from him since.
- It's not an overnight decision
for him.

01:46:47.766 --> 01:46:51.964
- What if he doesn't testify?
- Then we got a very serious problem.

01:47:06.118 --> 01:47:09.519
Ha... Have Shakes talk
to Father Bobby again.

01:47:10.789 --> 01:47:14.384
Have him tell him the whole story.
He'll know what that means.

01:47:14.459 --> 01:47:19.055
- He already has.
- What?

01:47:19.131 --> 01:47:23.864
l-I wa... I was with him
when he talked to Father Bobby.

01:47:26.204 --> 01:47:28.570
I heard everything, Michael.

01:47:38.450 --> 01:47:41.078
So you know.

01:47:42.454 --> 01:47:44.388
Yeah.

01:47:47.626 --> 01:47:49.753
If only you'd told me.

01:47:52.264 --> 01:47:56.200
l... I think things
could have been different.

01:47:58.537 --> 01:48:01.062
If you could've talked.

01:48:05.077 --> 01:48:08.569
Maybe... Maybe we...

01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:13.284
Maybe...

01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:21.258
I don't...

01:48:33.772 --> 01:48:36.263
- Spill 'em, you know?
- Right.

01:48:36.341 --> 01:48:38.400
Hey, Shay, how ya doin'?

01:48:38.477 --> 01:48:41.640
Oh, man, that diet is working.
I don't care what anybody says.

01:48:42.881 --> 01:48:46.874
- You still have a thing for Doris Day?
- She's a good woman.

01:48:48.253 --> 01:48:50.813
You know Lastrega?

01:48:50.889 --> 01:48:54.086
Hard to miss a lady
with four warts and only one eye.

01:48:54.159 --> 01:48:57.959
She needs the heads.
Salvatore.

01:49:01.633 --> 01:49:04.193
Take this to the witch.

01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:08.133
- Now, why does she need the heads?
- She takes the eyes.

01:49:08.206 --> 01:49:10.140
Oh. Wonderful.

01:49:10.208 --> 01:49:13.644
Puts them in a bowl
and mixes them with water and oil.

01:49:13.712 --> 01:49:15.304
And then?

01:49:16.648 --> 01:49:19.742
People get headaches,
they go to her.

01:49:19.818 --> 01:49:24.846
She looks into their eyes and tells them
who is wishing the headaches.

01:49:24.923 --> 01:49:29.383
She says a few words,
and the headaches go away.

01:49:29.461 --> 01:49:33.830
Once in a while, the person who
wished the headaches goes away too.

01:49:33.899 --> 01:49:38.563
This guy Addison,
the one who works for the mayor...

01:49:38.637 --> 01:49:41.435
he quits his job in two weeks.

01:49:41.506 --> 01:49:45.067
He don't want nobody to know
what kind of a guy he is.

01:49:45.143 --> 01:49:49.546
He don't want nobody to see pictures
of him they shouldn't see.

01:49:49.614 --> 01:49:52.879
- He knows us?
- He will.

01:49:52.951 --> 01:49:55.476
The boys he buys for parties
are expensive.

01:49:55.554 --> 01:50:00.389
Now, Addison makes good money,
but he don't make real money.

01:50:00.459 --> 01:50:04.759
- How much does he owe?
- Eight grand with a heavy vig.

01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:08.061
- I paid that off.
- You paid?

01:50:08.133 --> 01:50:11.796
Addison's debts belong to me now.

01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:14.896
- You hate debts.
- I hate Addison.

01:50:16.942 --> 01:50:20.776
We're in the dirty end of the field now.
That's where I play.

01:50:20.846 --> 01:50:25.112
And I like to play alone.
You're a nice kid. You always were.

01:50:26.117 --> 01:50:29.314
Don't let this change it. Go.

01:50:40.899 --> 01:50:45.996
His mother named him Edward Goldenberg
Robinson, after her favorite actor.

01:50:46.071 --> 01:50:49.529
To continue the Hollywood connection,
Eddie Robinson took the street name...

01:50:49.608 --> 01:50:54.375
" Little Caesar" as he made his way up
the ranks of the lucrative drug trade.

01:50:54.446 --> 01:50:58.246
He had a 12-year-old son in
a private school in upstate New York.

01:50:58.316 --> 01:51:00.944
He named him Rizzo,
after his youngest brother...

01:51:01.019 --> 01:51:04.284
who died while in the custody
of the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

01:51:04.356 --> 01:51:07.257
I want you to give me some money.

01:51:07.325 --> 01:51:12.319
All right. I'll play along.
How long before you pay it back?

01:51:12.397 --> 01:51:15.924
I ain't paying it back.
Somebody else is.

01:51:18.169 --> 01:51:21.661
- This somebody I know?
- Your little brother knew him.

01:51:22.541 --> 01:51:25.203
- Rizzo?
- Mm-hmm.

01:51:25.911 --> 01:51:28.106
How did he know Rizzo?

01:51:28.179 --> 01:51:32.775
Henry Addison was a guard
in an upstate reform school.

01:51:32.851 --> 01:51:36.787
He was there the same time as Rizzo,
before and after he died.

01:51:39.624 --> 01:51:44.152
Bip, count out $8,000.

01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:46.163
Put it in an envelope.

01:51:48.967 --> 01:51:53.495
You, uh, go back
a long time, old man.

01:51:54.673 --> 01:51:56.334
Old men always do.

01:51:56.408 --> 01:51:59.809
Ran with the Guineas,
back when the Guineas were tough.

01:51:59.878 --> 01:52:02.346
I ran when I could.

01:52:02.414 --> 01:52:04.575
Looked good doin' it too.

01:52:06.484 --> 01:52:11.649
Gave the business some style,
some class.

01:52:11.723 --> 01:52:16.558
Made it a call for respect, the way
you wore it, the way you talked it.

01:52:16.628 --> 01:52:19.495
Always liked that about you.

01:52:19.564 --> 01:52:22.829
I'm no help to you.
My tailor is dead.

01:52:29.674 --> 01:52:34.441
I'll look up our friend
and collect the money he owes me.

01:52:34.512 --> 01:52:37.174
He owes you something
more than money.

01:52:37.248 --> 01:52:40.706
- Ain't nothin' worth more
than the green.
- This is.

01:52:40.785 --> 01:52:45.449
What, old man? What's this guy owe
that means more than dollars?

01:52:45.523 --> 01:52:49.892
He owes you Rizzo. He's the man
that killed your brother.

01:52:59.137 --> 01:53:01.935
They said he died of pneumonia.

01:53:02.007 --> 01:53:03.736
They said.

01:53:10.115 --> 01:53:12.481
What is the relevance of this?

01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:15.041
So Ralph Ferguson
is a Sunday school teacher?

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:19.022
I don't know, Counsel.
What you're asking is highly unusual.

01:53:19.090 --> 01:53:23.424
I understand that, Your Honor. Again,
I need to put a face to the victim.

01:53:23.495 --> 01:53:27.056
Uh, otherwise, just another name
in the obituaries.

01:53:28.099 --> 01:53:33.799
- Mr. Snyder, any objections?
- I don't have a problem with it.

01:53:34.372 --> 01:53:38.399
Your Honor, the prosecution would like
to call Ralph Ferguson to the stand.

01:54:04.469 --> 01:54:07.165
- Good morning, Mr. Ferguson.
- Good morning.

01:54:07.238 --> 01:54:10.935
I'd like to thank you for coming.
I realize for you it's been a long trip.

01:54:11.009 --> 01:54:14.308
I'm just sorry it had to be
for something like this.

01:54:14.379 --> 01:54:17.007
You and the victim, Sean Nokes,
were such good friends...

01:54:17.082 --> 01:54:19.642
I think your testimony as a character
witness will be very valuable.

01:54:19.718 --> 01:54:23.711
We were great friends. It would be
hard to find a better friend.

01:54:23.788 --> 01:54:27.815
- Would you say
you were his best friend?
- I was his closest. That's for sure.

01:54:27.892 --> 01:54:32.727
- How long did you know each other?
- Uh, about 17, 18 years.

01:54:32.797 --> 01:54:36.358
- Did you see each other often?
- As often as we could.

01:54:36.434 --> 01:54:40.962
Weekends, holidays, vacations...
things like that.

01:54:41.039 --> 01:54:44.566
- What kind of man was Sean Nokes?
- He was a good man.

01:54:44.642 --> 01:54:48.009
He was too good to be shot dead
by a couple of street punks.

01:54:48.079 --> 01:54:50.206
Objection, Your Honor. Statement
is one of opinion, not fact.

01:54:50.281 --> 01:54:53.341
- He was asked his opinion.
- Overruled.

01:54:53.418 --> 01:54:56.012
Please proceed.

01:54:56.087 --> 01:54:59.989
Mr. Ferguson, were you aware
of any enemies he might have had?

01:55:00.058 --> 01:55:02.253
Sean Nokes had no enemies.

01:55:02.327 --> 01:55:06.195
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson.
I have no further questions.

01:55:10.502 --> 01:55:12.732
What is that, a prison?

01:55:12.804 --> 01:55:15.272
No. It's a juvenile facility
for young boys.

01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:17.934
And your function was what
at this juvenile facility?

01:55:18.009 --> 01:55:21.501
Standard stuff...
keep the boys in line...

01:55:21.579 --> 01:55:24.673
make sure they got
to their classes on time, um...

01:55:24.749 --> 01:55:27.513
keep an eye out for trouble,
put them down for the night.

01:55:27.585 --> 01:55:30.486
- Nothing exciting.
- As guards, were you and Mr. Nokes...

01:55:30.555 --> 01:55:34.423
allowed to use force to, as you put it,
keep the boys in line?

01:55:34.492 --> 01:55:37.359
Wh-What?
What do you mean, "force"?

01:55:37.428 --> 01:55:41.125
- Were you allowed to hit them?
- No. Of course not.

01:55:41.199 --> 01:55:43.599
Were any of the boys
hit by any of the guards...

01:55:43.668 --> 01:55:46.899
at any time at the Wilkinson Home?

01:55:46.971 --> 01:55:49.132
Yeah, I'm sure that something
like that may have happened.

01:55:49.207 --> 01:55:53.371
It was a... It was a big place.
But it wasn't the common practice.

01:55:53.444 --> 01:55:55.674
Sure. Let's narrow
the place down then.

01:55:55.747 --> 01:55:58.875
Did you or Mr. Nokes ever hit
any of the boys under your care...

01:55:58.950 --> 01:56:01.578
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:11.954
Would you like me to repeat
the question, Mr. Ferguson?

01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:14.624
No.

01:56:14.699 --> 01:56:18.157
Then answer it, please.
And remember, you're under oath.

01:56:18.236 --> 01:56:21.364
A few of the boys who we considered
to be discipline problems...

01:56:21.439 --> 01:56:25.068
- Uh, were hit on occasion.
- And, uh, how were they hit?

01:56:25.143 --> 01:56:27.338
- I don't know what you mean?
- A fist?

01:56:27.412 --> 01:56:31.439
Open hand? Kick? Baton, maybe?

01:56:31.516 --> 01:56:34.451
It depended on what
the situation called for.

01:56:34.519 --> 01:56:37.647
- Who determined that situation?
- The guard on the scene.

01:56:37.722 --> 01:56:40.247
That's a lot of power to have
over a boy, isn't it?

01:56:40.325 --> 01:56:44.955
- It came with the job, sir.
- Did torture come with the job?

01:56:53.238 --> 01:56:55.968
Boys were tortured,
weren't they, Mr. Ferguson?

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.031
Define torture?

01:56:59.110 --> 01:57:02.238
Well, let's define torture.

01:57:02.313 --> 01:57:08.115
Uh, cigarette burning,
random beatings...

01:57:08.186 --> 01:57:13.317
solitary confinement
with no food and no light.

01:57:13.391 --> 01:57:16.986
- Would you say that took place?
- On occasion.

01:57:17.061 --> 01:57:20.121
- Who tortured them?
- Guards.

01:57:20.198 --> 01:57:23.224
Which guards?

01:57:23.301 --> 01:57:25.633
I don't...
I can't remember all of'em.

01:57:27.372 --> 01:57:30.068
Remember one.

01:57:30.141 --> 01:57:32.507
Mr. Ferguson, remember one.

01:57:37.782 --> 01:57:40.546
Remember one.

01:57:40.618 --> 01:57:43.018
Mr. Fergu...

01:57:43.755 --> 01:57:46.087
Let me ask you this, Mr. Ferguson.
Was there ever any sexual...

01:57:46.157 --> 01:57:49.388
Counsel, this line of questioning
better lead somewhere
having to do with this case.

01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:52.429
- It will, Your Honor.
- For your sake.

01:57:52.497 --> 01:57:55.933
Yes, sir. Uh, Mr. Ferguson,
was there ever any sexual abuse...

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.491
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

01:58:01.005 --> 01:58:06.102
Was there ever any sexual abuse
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

01:58:07.245 --> 01:58:10.908
- Yes. I heard that there was.
- I'm not asking what you heard.

01:58:10.982 --> 01:58:14.850
I'm asking what you saw.

01:58:16.421 --> 01:58:19.049
- Please push the door closed.
- I thought all you boys liked this.

01:58:19.123 --> 01:58:23.219
- No!
- Yes, I saw.

01:58:23.294 --> 01:58:28.391
Did you and Sean Nokes ever
force yourself on any of the boys?

01:58:28.466 --> 01:58:34.029
Did you and Sean Nokes ever rape
any of the boys at Wilkinson Home?

01:58:40.078 --> 01:58:44.139
Counselors, approach.

01:58:55.693 --> 01:58:57.593
I just fucked your little friend Johnny.

01:58:57.662 --> 01:59:00.790
Counselor, what the hell
is going on here?

01:59:02.567 --> 01:59:04.728
I guess I called
the wrong character witness.

01:59:04.802 --> 01:59:08.704
Counselor, I've given you wide latitude
in calling this character witness.

01:59:08.773 --> 01:59:12.709
- Now it's blown up in your face.
- Please, sir, don't do this to me!

01:59:12.777 --> 01:59:15.837
- Oh, you're gonna like it.
- I don't like it!

01:59:17.281 --> 01:59:19.909
Mr. Ferguson,
please answer the question.

01:59:19.984 --> 01:59:23.112
- Please, Ferguson...
- I'm gonna come see you tomorrow, okay?

01:59:23.187 --> 01:59:25.951
- And remember something...
- Let me ask you, Mr. Ferguson...

01:59:26.024 --> 01:59:30.984
- I like it nice and slow.
- Sean Nokes visited your home
on occasion. Is that correct?

01:59:31.062 --> 01:59:35.021
Would your ex-wife ever leave
Sean Nokes alone with your child?

01:59:35.099 --> 01:59:37.363
- My child?
- Yes.

01:59:37.435 --> 01:59:40.370
In other words, would your ex-wife
ever leave Sean Nokes alone...

01:59:40.438 --> 01:59:43.271
- With-with-with your child?
- There would be no reason for that.

01:59:43.341 --> 01:59:46.469
There would be no reason
for him to be alone with our child.

01:59:46.544 --> 01:59:49.012
- It wouldn't come up.
- Uh-huh. Never came up.

01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:52.846
Didn't she ever voice any concern...

01:59:52.917 --> 01:59:57.854
explaining why she would never
allow Sean Nokes to be in a room...

01:59:57.922 --> 02:00:00.049
- Alone with your son?
- Objection.

02:00:00.124 --> 02:00:02.524
- Objection.
- Sustained.

02:00:02.593 --> 02:00:05.687
Did you ever rape one of the boys
at Wilkinson Home for Boys?

02:00:05.763 --> 02:00:09.824
- Sean Nokes. Did he... Did he...
- I like it nice and slow.

02:00:09.901 --> 02:00:12.995
- From your ex-wife...
- You ain't gonna touch me ever again!

02:00:22.713 --> 02:00:24.010
Yes.

02:00:34.659 --> 02:00:36.593
Yes?

02:00:40.765 --> 02:00:42.995
Yes, what?

02:00:47.338 --> 02:00:51.434
Yes, Sean Nokes
had experiences with some boys.

02:00:54.278 --> 02:00:58.544
- Were you there?
- Yes.

02:00:58.616 --> 02:01:01.517
Did you observe these experiences?

02:01:01.586 --> 02:01:03.520
Yes.

02:01:05.223 --> 02:01:08.124
Did you more than observe?

02:01:08.192 --> 02:01:10.922
I was drinking and...

02:01:12.697 --> 02:01:16.793
Were there any other guards around
during these experiences?

02:01:17.535 --> 02:01:19.469
Yes.

02:01:20.705 --> 02:01:23.230
- With you and Mr. Nokes?
- Yes.

02:01:24.108 --> 02:01:28.238
- On more than one occasion?
- Yes.

02:01:31.382 --> 02:01:33.316
Yeah.

02:01:39.423 --> 02:01:44.383
Mr. Ferguson, do you still think
that Sean Nokes was a good man?

02:01:44.462 --> 02:01:47.192
He was my friend.

02:01:49.367 --> 02:01:53.326
A friend who raped and abused boys
he was paid to look after.

02:02:04.882 --> 02:02:07.043
I have no further questions.

02:02:12.256 --> 02:02:14.781
I want this to be over.

02:02:16.027 --> 02:02:18.552
I want this to be over.

02:02:21.098 --> 02:02:23.532
Witness is excused.

02:02:24.235 --> 02:02:27.466
Mr. Ferguson.

02:02:27.538 --> 02:02:30.666
Mr. Ferguson...

02:02:30.741 --> 02:02:33.710
if I were you, I wouldn't stray
too far from home.

02:02:33.778 --> 02:02:36.804
People will want to talk to you.
Do you understand?

02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:42.681
Michael continued to swim both ends
of the pool at the same time.

02:02:42.753 --> 02:02:46.382
Playing prosecution and
defense attorney, he exposed Ferguson
for what he was...

02:02:46.457 --> 02:02:51.156
and still keptJohn and Tommy's
motive for killing Nokes hidden
from the eyes of the court.

02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:56.428
Little Caesar, who always kept
a picture of his dead brother
in his breast pocket...

02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:59.936
called in the Henry Addison loan.

02:03:00.004 --> 02:03:02.632
It was a loan Addison
couldn't afford to pay back...

02:03:02.707 --> 02:03:07.371
and it gave Little Caesar
the only reason he needed
to even his score for Rizzo.

02:03:37.775 --> 02:03:41.802
Davenport wasted little time
on following up on Adam Styler.

02:03:41.879 --> 02:03:45.872
He was quickly arrested
and charged with the shooting death
of the Queens drug dealer...

02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:48.885
and eight counts
of corruption and bribery.

02:03:49.654 --> 02:03:52.782
<i>Twenty</i>-<i>three, please</i>...

02:04:02.533 --> 02:04:05.195
That's six for me, two for you.

02:04:07.505 --> 02:04:11.066
See, most people
play this game in the summer.

02:04:11.142 --> 02:04:13.133
It's easier to see the ball
without tears in your eyes.

02:04:13.210 --> 02:04:15.269
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- I give a fuck about most people.

02:04:20.918 --> 02:04:24.979
You're gonna have a heart attack,
and I'm not breathin' in your mouth.

02:04:25.056 --> 02:04:27.991
Yeah, well, I'm not going
to marry you either.

02:04:30.528 --> 02:04:34.294
John and Tommy smell something.
They just don't know what.

02:04:34.365 --> 02:04:38.461
A spick be living in the White House
by the time it reaches
their fucking brains.

02:04:38.536 --> 02:04:41.767
Snyder came through big.
He's not half bad.

02:04:41.839 --> 02:04:43.773
The way you told it, I thought
he could hardly stand up.

02:04:43.841 --> 02:04:46.571
Oh, no. He's a drunk,
but he's not a fool.

02:04:46.644 --> 02:04:49.875
We only win
when John and Tommy walk.

02:04:49.947 --> 02:04:52.609
Then you'll have to get them
out of the shooting court.

02:04:52.683 --> 02:04:56.449
You have to put them someplace else.
And only a witness does that for you.

02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:59.956
And he's doing a Claude Rains so far.
Nobody's seen the fucker.

02:05:00.024 --> 02:05:04.461
What if he doesn't show? What if we
have to go in the way we are?

02:05:04.528 --> 02:05:08.191
The street is the only one that matters.
Court is for uptown people...

02:05:08.265 --> 02:05:11.757
with suits, money,
lawyers with three names.

02:05:11.836 --> 02:05:14.498
If you got cash,
you can buy court justice.

02:05:14.572 --> 02:05:17.405
But on the street,
justice has no price.

02:05:17.475 --> 02:05:21.036
She's blind where the judge sits,
but she's not blind out here.

02:05:21.112 --> 02:05:23.239
Out here, the bitch got eyes.

02:05:24.482 --> 02:05:26.643
We need both.

02:05:27.852 --> 02:05:30.343
Then you need a witness.

02:06:16.267 --> 02:06:18.531
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

02:06:18.602 --> 02:06:22.038
you are to disregard the testimony
of Ralph Ferguson.

02:06:22.106 --> 02:06:25.075
His entire testimony
is stricken from this record.

02:06:25.142 --> 02:06:27.633
That concludes the people's case,
Your Honor.

02:06:27.711 --> 02:06:29.702
- People rest?
- People rest.

02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:34.046
- Is the defense ready to proceed?
- Uh, I'm not sure.

02:06:34.118 --> 02:06:38.714
Uh, Your Honor, I don't, uh...
I don't know, uh...

02:06:38.789 --> 02:06:41.724
- You don't know?
- Well, I'm not sure that, uh...

02:06:41.792 --> 02:06:44.420
- We're waiting, uh...
- All right.
9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning...

02:06:44.495 --> 02:06:46.929
present a witness
or be prepared to sum up.

02:06:46.997 --> 02:06:49.295
9:00 a.m.

02:07:09.553 --> 02:07:11.487
- Everything good?
- Good.

02:07:11.555 --> 02:07:14.115
- Good. I like to hear that.
- Bye-bye.

02:07:45.523 --> 02:07:49.857
- You're late.
- Very interesting attending
the morning mass.

02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:55.658
Your Honor, the defense calls
Father Robert Carillo.

02:08:04.642 --> 02:08:06.769
Father, do you know
most of the people in your parish?

02:08:06.844 --> 02:08:11.110
- I know all the people in my parish.
- Do you know the two defendants,
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano?

02:08:11.181 --> 02:08:14.275
- Yes, I do.
- How long have you known them?

02:08:14.351 --> 02:08:17.343
Since they were boys.
They were both students of mine.

02:08:17.421 --> 02:08:19.355
- Remain standing.
- How long has it been?

02:08:19.423 --> 02:08:23.120
- It'll be 20 years this spring.
- Raise your right hand.

02:08:23.193 --> 02:08:25.889
- I'm a priest.
- The case of the people...

02:08:25.963 --> 02:08:29.296
of the state of New York
againstJohn Reilly and Thomas Marcano.

02:08:29.366 --> 02:08:31.800
Do you swear the evidence
you are about to give is the truth...

02:08:31.869 --> 02:08:36.431
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

02:08:36.507 --> 02:08:38.168
I do.

02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:48.183
Father, do you recall, uh,
where you were on the night
of November 1 of this past year?

02:08:48.252 --> 02:08:50.880
- Yes, I do.
- Where was that?

02:08:50.955 --> 02:08:55.688
I was at the basketball game at the
Garden, the Knicks versus the Celtics.

02:08:55.759 --> 02:08:58.819
And, uh, when
did the Knick game begin?

02:09:00.698 --> 02:09:03.223
- About 7:30.
- What time did it end?

02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:07.430
- Between 9:30 and 10:00.
- Do you remember who won that game?

02:09:07.504 --> 02:09:11.634
Sad to say, it was the Celtics.
Kevin McHale and Robert Parrish...

02:09:11.709 --> 02:09:15.543
were a little too much for our boys that
night, even if it was All Saint's Day.

02:09:15.613 --> 02:09:18.548
Well, next time, give me a call.
I'll try my guy.

02:09:18.616 --> 02:09:20.345
I'll try that.

02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:24.781
Father Carillo,
were you at the game alone?

02:09:26.090 --> 02:09:30.390
- No. I went there with two friends.
- And who were those
two friends, Father?

02:09:31.829 --> 02:09:34.354
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano.

02:09:35.633 --> 02:09:39.899
- The two defendants?
- Yes. The same two defendants.

02:09:40.571 --> 02:09:43.301
Father Carillo, at 8:25 p. M...

02:09:43.374 --> 02:09:47.333
the time the police say
the victim Sean Nokes was murdered...

02:09:47.411 --> 02:09:50.903
were you still with Mr. Reilly
and Mr. Marcano at the basketball game?

02:09:50.981 --> 02:09:53.677
- Yes, I was.
- And at what time did you...

02:09:53.751 --> 02:09:56.652
Mr. Reilly and Mr. Marcano
part company?

02:09:58.122 --> 02:10:01.785
It was around 10:30,
a little later.

02:10:01.859 --> 02:10:03.850
They dropped me off
in front of the rectory...

02:10:03.927 --> 02:10:06.327
near where they had picked me up.

02:10:06.397 --> 02:10:09.025
Did the two defendants
tell you where they were going?

02:10:09.099 --> 02:10:11.590
No, they didn't. But I imagine
after a night spent with a priest...

02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:14.502
they went looking for the first
open bar they could find.

02:10:14.571 --> 02:10:17.938
So, then, Father,
if the two defendants...

02:10:18.008 --> 02:10:20.636
were with you at 8:25
at the night of the murder...

02:10:20.711 --> 02:10:24.670
they couldn't have shot and killed
Sean Nokes, as the prosecution contends.

02:10:24.748 --> 02:10:26.978
Isn't that correct?

02:10:27.051 --> 02:10:29.417
Not unless they shot him
from the blue seats at the Garden.

02:10:29.486 --> 02:10:33.820
No. No.
He was not shot from there.

02:10:36.193 --> 02:10:39.754
Then he was not shot
by those boys.

02:10:40.631 --> 02:10:44.032
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Father.

02:10:44.101 --> 02:10:47.195
- Your witness, Mr. Sullivan.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

02:10:51.875 --> 02:10:54.503
Did you buy the tickets for the game,
Father, or were they given to you?

02:10:54.578 --> 02:10:56.569
- No. I bought them.
- On the day of the game?

02:10:56.647 --> 02:10:59.081
I went to the box office
about a week before.

02:10:59.149 --> 02:11:01.674
Uh, did anyone know
you were going to the game,
other than the two defendants?

02:11:01.752 --> 02:11:04.016
I don't think so.

02:11:04.088 --> 02:11:06.989
- Was anyone with you
when you purchased the tickets?
- No.

02:11:07.057 --> 02:11:10.220
- No one saw you buy the tickets?
- That's right.

02:11:10.294 --> 02:11:12.455
- Did you get a receipt?
- No, I didn't.

02:11:12.529 --> 02:11:16.795
- Pay by check, MasterCard, Visa?
- No. I paid by cash.

02:11:16.867 --> 02:11:19.233
I usually pay for things in cash.

02:11:21.004 --> 02:11:23.529
You care for the boys in your parish,
don't you, Father?

02:11:23.607 --> 02:11:25.802
Very much.

02:11:25.876 --> 02:11:29.107
And there isn't anything you
wouldn't do for them. Am I right?

02:11:29.179 --> 02:11:31.647
Anything in my power to do,
I would make it a point.

02:11:32.549 --> 02:11:35.848
You're like a father, a good father,
looking out for one of his sons.

02:11:36.754 --> 02:11:40.190
- Something along those lines, yes.
- And is it true, then...

02:11:40.257 --> 02:11:43.249
as a good father, you would want
to protect them from something
they shouldn't have done?

02:11:43.327 --> 02:11:47.730
As much as I would want to protect them
from something someone
else said they did, yes.

02:11:47.798 --> 02:11:51.393
- Like a murder?
- Yes, like a murder.

02:11:52.736 --> 02:11:54.704
Let me get this straight then.

02:11:54.772 --> 02:11:57.707
No one knew you were going to the game.
No one saw you at the game.

02:11:57.775 --> 02:12:00.903
No one saw you buy tickets for the game.
There's no record
you even bought tickets.

02:12:00.978 --> 02:12:04.175
You have no receipt for the tickets.
Am I correct?

02:12:05.749 --> 02:12:09.617
- Yes, that's correct.
- Then how do we really know, Father?

02:12:09.686 --> 02:12:12.120
How do we know
you and the two defendants...

02:12:12.189 --> 02:12:15.181
were at the game
on the night of the murder?

02:12:15.259 --> 02:12:18.695
I'm telling you as a witness
and as a priest we were at the game.

02:12:18.762 --> 02:12:22.755
Yes, as a priest.
And a priest wouldn't lie. Am I right?

02:12:22.833 --> 02:12:26.860
A priest with ticket stubs
wouldn't need to lie...

02:12:26.937 --> 02:12:31.067
and I always keep the stubs.

02:12:35.045 --> 02:12:38.014
Do you want to see them?

02:12:42.252 --> 02:12:46.188
Uh, why is that, Father?
Why... Uh, why do you keep the stubs?

02:12:46.256 --> 02:12:50.124
Because you never know when someone
might want more than your word.

02:12:51.461 --> 02:12:53.952
Has anyone ever questioned
your word before today?

02:12:54.031 --> 02:12:58.491
No. No one ever has.
But there's a first time for everything.

02:13:08.178 --> 02:13:11.272
I have no further questions.
Thank you, Father.

02:13:13.050 --> 02:13:15.450
Thank you, Father.
You may step down.

02:13:22.759 --> 02:13:25.319
I've never recovered from seeing
Father Bobby take the stand...

02:13:25.395 --> 02:13:29.695
and lie for us to even
the score forJohn and Tommy.

02:13:29.766 --> 02:13:33.725
He didn't just testify for them.
He testified against Wilkinson...

02:13:33.804 --> 02:13:36.568
and the evil that had lived there
for too long.

02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:39.040
Still, I was sorry he had to do it.

02:13:45.849 --> 02:13:48.477
With respect to the charge
of murder in the second degree...

02:13:48.552 --> 02:13:52.613
do you find the defendant,
John Reilly, guilt or not guilty?

02:13:52.689 --> 02:13:56.386
- Not guilty.
- With respect to the charge
of murder in the second degree...

02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:59.623
do you find the defendant,
Thomas Marcano...

02:13:59.696 --> 02:14:02.893
- Guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty.

02:14:02.966 --> 02:14:06.834
Thank you very much.
This jury is discharged.

02:14:27.491 --> 02:14:29.857
Hi. How are you?
Could I get a hot dog?

02:14:29.927 --> 02:14:32.919
- Yeah.
- Uh, mustard, relish.

02:14:33.931 --> 02:14:35.922
A lot of relish.

02:14:38.068 --> 02:14:40.434
Give him two napkins.

02:14:45.242 --> 02:14:48.006
You did good in there, Counselor.

02:14:49.279 --> 02:14:51.543
So, what happens to you now?

02:14:51.615 --> 02:14:54.550
What happens? I walk away.

02:14:54.618 --> 02:14:58.019
I'll wait a few weeks,
I'll hand in my notice...

02:14:58.088 --> 02:15:00.648
and after the way
I handled this case...

02:15:00.724 --> 02:15:03.420
they won't be in a rush
to keep me from the door.

02:15:05.228 --> 02:15:08.561
So you switch to the other side
and work as a defense lawyer.

02:15:08.632 --> 02:15:10.566
The money's better.

02:15:10.634 --> 02:15:14.195
There's always gonna be more bad guys
than good, Mikey.

02:15:15.072 --> 02:15:17.870
And can you imagine the work
you'd get from John and Tommy's crew?

02:15:17.941 --> 02:15:20.466
- Yeah.
- That's a house and a pool.

02:15:22.446 --> 02:15:24.914
Not for me.

02:15:24.982 --> 02:15:28.042
I've seen all the law
I want to see.

02:15:28.118 --> 02:15:31.554
- It's time for something else.
- Like what?

02:15:31.621 --> 02:15:34.215
Let you know when I know.

02:15:34.291 --> 02:15:36.521
You know, you're too old
to play for the Yankees...

02:15:36.593 --> 02:15:38.527
and you're too young
to take up golf.

02:15:38.595 --> 02:15:42.827
Why you shooting holes
through all my plans? You're...
You're gonna make me panic.

02:15:42.899 --> 02:15:46.960
You'll work it out.
You always have.

02:15:50.507 --> 02:15:53.101
It's time for quiet, Shakes.

02:15:54.478 --> 02:15:58.437
I just want to shut my eyes and
not have to see the places I've been.

02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:02.415
I'm weary.

02:16:05.789 --> 02:16:07.723
I don't know.

02:16:10.093 --> 02:16:13.824
Maybe I'll get lucky,
forget I was even there.

02:16:13.897 --> 02:16:19.301
Well, don't disappear on me, Counselor.
I may need a good lawyer one day.

02:16:19.369 --> 02:16:22.304
- Hey, you can't afford a good lawyer.
- Okay.

02:16:24.041 --> 02:16:28.341
I may need a good friend though.

02:16:28.412 --> 02:16:31.279
I'll find you when you do.
Count on it.

02:16:33.183 --> 02:16:35.174
Always have.

02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:42.918
A full month had passed
since the acquittal...

02:16:42.993 --> 02:16:44.927
and no one had made contact.

02:16:44.995 --> 02:16:46.963
In those few weeks,
our lives had reverted back...

02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:50.261
to what they'd been
prior to the murder of Sean Nokes.

02:16:50.333 --> 02:16:53.530
Carol had returned to her stack
of social service files...

02:16:53.602 --> 02:16:56.197
helping troubled teens
and single mothers.

02:16:56.272 --> 02:16:58.537
John and Tommy
went back to the streets...

02:16:58.608 --> 02:17:00.666
running the West Side Boys.

02:17:00.744 --> 02:17:03.508
I was promoted from clerk
to reporter trainee...

02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:05.605
covering the entertainment beat.

02:17:05.682 --> 02:17:07.946
Michael, as he had promised,
resigned from his job...

02:17:08.018 --> 02:17:11.044
after working the losing end
of a "can't miss" case.

02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:13.055
Excuse me.

02:17:15.125 --> 02:17:18.218
I don't know
how to fuckin' thank you.

02:17:19.963 --> 02:17:22.830
- All right.
- I can't believe what you did.

02:17:22.898 --> 02:17:26.096
- I can't believe you got away with it.
- It wasn't me, man. That was Mikey.

02:17:26.169 --> 02:17:29.002
- It was all Mikey's plan.
- You know, when I first heard
he was taking the case...

02:17:29.072 --> 02:17:31.302
- I was gonna have him burned.
- And?

02:17:31.374 --> 02:17:34.275
And I figured he's a friend,
and if you gotta be sent away
on a murder rap, who better to do it?

02:17:34.343 --> 02:17:37.313
Well, the way he's handling
his end of the case, I thought
he sucked as a lawyer.

02:17:37.379 --> 02:17:39.848
- I started feeling sorry
for the bastard.
- Hey.

02:17:39.915 --> 02:17:42.646
Never feel sorry for a lawyer.

02:17:42.718 --> 02:17:45.347
Get over here, Counselor!

02:17:45.422 --> 02:17:47.913
You are the real count...

02:17:47.991 --> 02:17:51.790
alive and well
and living in New York City.

02:17:51.861 --> 02:17:55.161
- Fuckin' maniac.
- All right. All right.

02:17:55.232 --> 02:17:58.360
- You maniac. Jesus!
- What is this, a gay bar?

02:17:59.102 --> 02:18:01.536
- Uh-oh.
- It was until you came in.

02:18:01.605 --> 02:18:04.972
Why don't you give me a kiss
to go with that hello?

02:18:09.612 --> 02:18:12.343
- Get out of the way.
- You're next.

02:18:15.418 --> 02:18:18.683
- Break it up there!
- Let's have a drink.

02:18:23.793 --> 02:18:27.193
- The Four Gladiators.
- Oh, he's right. I forget, you know?

02:18:27.263 --> 02:18:30.960
The Four Gladiators. Worst quartet
to ever hold a Hell's Kitchen corner,
swear to God.

02:18:31.034 --> 02:18:34.128
- Yeah, but what was that name
that Shakes wanted to call it?
- No, no, no, no.

02:18:34.204 --> 02:18:36.798
Genius wanted to call it
the Count and his Cristos.

02:18:36.873 --> 02:18:40.775
- Nice name!
- It's so sweet, isn't it?

02:18:40.843 --> 02:18:43.074
- That would've sent albums
flying out of the stores.
- We weren't that...

02:18:43.146 --> 02:18:45.671
We weren't that bad. I mean,
some people wanted to hear us sing.

02:18:45.749 --> 02:18:48.912
- We were that bad.
- Yeah, the kids at the deaf
school don't count.

02:18:52.455 --> 02:18:54.787
- One song for Carol.
- Oh, no.

02:18:54.858 --> 02:18:57.451
- I retired a long time ago.
- Come on, you mutts.
- Wait, wait, wait.

02:18:57.527 --> 02:19:01.361
Don't you guys have to go
and shoot somebody?

02:19:01.431 --> 02:19:03.193
- Ohh!
- No!

02:19:04.567 --> 02:19:08.094
No. We always got time
for a song.

02:19:08.171 --> 02:19:10.537
Just kidding.
You know what I'm saying?

02:19:10.607 --> 02:19:13.166
- Wine, anybody?
- You pick it, but nothin' too slow.

02:19:13.243 --> 02:19:15.609
All right. Start us off.

02:19:18.013 --> 02:19:21.677
- How many songs do you know?
- One.

02:19:26.121 --> 02:19:32.357
<i>Walk like a man</i>

02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:37.891
<i>Walk like a man, fast as you can</i>

02:19:37.968 --> 02:19:41.904
<i>Walk like a man, my son</i>

02:19:41.972 --> 02:19:45.532
<i>I'll tell the world</i>
<i>to forget about the girl</i>

02:20:01.925 --> 02:20:05.691

02:20:08.131 --> 02:20:10.998
right next to the bottle
of boiler gin that killed him.

02:20:11.067 --> 02:20:15.128

The body lay undiscovered
for more than a week.

02:20:31.655 --> 02:20:35.182
There was a crucifix and a picture
of St. Jude in his picket.

02:20:35.258 --> 02:20:37.249
He was 29 years old.

02:20:38.962 --> 02:20:42.295
Michael Sullivan lives in a small
town in the English countryside...

02:20:42.365 --> 02:20:44.833
where he works part-time
as a carpenter.

02:20:44.901 --> 02:20:48.132
He no longer practices law,
and he has never married.

02:20:48.204 --> 02:20:50.468
He lives quietly and alone.

02:20:52.742 --> 02:20:55.836

for a social service agency...

02:20:55.912 --> 02:20:57.379
and lives in Hell's Kitchen.

02:20:57.447 --> 02:20:58.539
She has never married...

02:20:58.615 --> 02:21:02.574
but is a single mother

John Thomas Michael Martinez...

02:21:06.189 --> 02:21:09.750
Ioves to read and is called
"Shakes" by his mother.

02:21:11.961 --> 02:21:16.091
It was our special night,
and we held it for as long as we could.

02:21:16.166 --> 02:21:18.464
It was our happy ending...

02:21:18.535 --> 02:21:21.595
and the last time we would ever
be together again.

02:22:10.587 --> 02:22:12.919
The future lay sparkling ahead...

02:22:12.989 --> 02:22:16.117
and we thought we would
know each other forever.
