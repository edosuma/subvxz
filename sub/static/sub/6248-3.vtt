00:25.658 --> 00:29.617
Holy Mother of God!
Mmm! Geez!

00:29.696 --> 00:32.722
[Brennan]
Booth, what do we have here?

00:32.799 --> 00:34.733
[Hodgins]
Bet I know.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.598
That's... [Sniffing]
lasagna...

00:36.669 --> 00:40.161
fishy rotten cat food,
and vulcanized rubber.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.265
Excellent olfactory talent, Hodgins.

00:42.342 --> 00:44.833
- What happened?
- Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

00:44.911 --> 00:47.004
<i>Guy tried to beat the light.</i>
<i>He got T-boned.</i>

00:47.080 --> 00:50.015
- What was the semi carrying?
- Aquarium sand. But that's not...

00:50.083 --> 00:52.779
No natural gas or propane?
No explosion? No fire?

00:52.852 --> 00:56.652
- No corrosive chemicals.
- What do you need me for?

00:56.723 --> 00:58.850
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>You might want to prepare yourself.</i>

00:58.925 --> 01:02.622
- Or not.
- <i>[Booth] Oh, man.</i>

01:02.695 --> 01:07.826
Okay, how bad does, uh, garbage gotta stink
to cover the smell of a dead body?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.664
I think the victim was a minor.

01:09.736 --> 01:13.172
Okay. Well, then if you agree,
then this falls under F.B.I. jurisdiction.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.708
It's a male.

01:19.779 --> 01:22.475
Yes. An adolescent.

01:22.549 --> 01:25.643
Flatworms, necrophagous flies
and beetles.

01:25.718 --> 01:27.948
<i>Yeah, he's been garbage</i>
<i>for about three weeks.</i>

01:28.021 --> 01:30.148
I didn't mean that
the way it sounded.

01:32.559 --> 01:37.929
Fractures to the cranium, sphenoid,
and occipital regions.

01:37.997 --> 01:41.023
Neck's broken.
And the femur is shattered.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.069
From the garbage truck
flipping over?

01:43.136 --> 01:46.731
No. This damage is
more congruent with a fall.

01:50.577 --> 01:54.445
- What do you got?
- It's organic.

01:54.514 --> 01:59.281
Whatever it is, he brought it with him
from the crime scene.

02:01.654 --> 02:06.148
- How much of this are you gonna need?
- The whole disgusting shebang.

02:06.226 --> 02:09.592
- [Groans] Everything?
- Everything.

02:09.662 --> 02:11.596
[Mumbles]

02:12.599 --> 02:14.533
He was wrapped in a shroud?

02:14.601 --> 02:16.592
Angela's analyzing
the stains on the cloth...

02:16.669 --> 02:19.035
while Hodgins figures out
what they're made of.

02:19.105 --> 02:21.869
No finger pads left for prints.
How are we on dental records?

02:21.941 --> 02:23.875
<i>F.B.I. 's on it.</i>

02:25.478 --> 02:29.915
Multiple shards of leaded glass
embedded in the remaining tissue.

02:31.417 --> 02:35.854
Massive contusions congruent
with a swan dive onto a hard surface.

02:35.922 --> 02:37.856
And take a look at the upper spine.

02:37.924 --> 02:41.951
Weighted impact against
the, uh, scapula and clavicle.

02:42.028 --> 02:46.192
- He was struck?
- Yes, but not hard enough to kill.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.757
Private garbage hauler.
They aren't real strict about their routes.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.531
Driver says he can't be sure
where he picked the victim up.

02:51.604 --> 02:55.540
- No visible tats or track marks.
- You sound surprised.

02:55.608 --> 02:58.270
Well, it's pretty obvious, Bones.
It's either a junkie or a hustler.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.073
Why make that assumption?

03:00.146 --> 03:02.808
Not many kids from the suburbs
end up riding in garbage trucks.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.282
- Fun factoid from the front lines.
- <i>[Angela] Hey, guys.</i>

03:06.419 --> 03:08.444
Want to see something cool?

03:08.521 --> 03:11.649
I assume you're all familiar
with the Shroud ofTurin.

03:11.724 --> 03:15.592
Image of Christ's face
on the inside a burial cloth.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.596
Right. Booth's a good Catholic boy.

03:17.664 --> 03:20.155
- It was revealed to be a hoax.
- [Booth] It wasn't a hoax.

03:20.233 --> 03:22.167
[Chuckles]
Okay. Whatever you want to believe.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.760
This is no hoax.

03:24.837 --> 03:27.829
On the fabric covering
John Doe's skull...

03:27.907 --> 03:32.241
<i>there are tissue stains around</i>
<i>the eye sockets, the nose, and the mouth.</i>

03:32.312 --> 03:35.281
<i>This is essentially</i>
<i>a photo negative ofhis features.</i>

03:35.348 --> 03:37.816
Are you saying you have enough
to assemble a face?

03:37.884 --> 03:41.342
- [Computer Beeping]
- I call it the Shroud of Montenegro.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.446
<i>I used computer tomography...</i>

03:43.523 --> 03:47.857
<i>to create X-ray slices</i>
<i>of the underlying facial architecture.</i>

03:47.927 --> 03:52.227
<i>Selective laser centering</i>
<i>allowed me to map unimprinted areas.</i>

03:52.298 --> 03:56.496
<i>Skin tone and hair color were</i>
<i>extrapolated based on Dr. Saroyan's data.</i>

03:56.569 --> 04:01.973
I'm no expert, but he sure doesn't
look like a street kid.

Advertise your product or brand here

04:38.111 --> 04:40.079
I'm running our facial reconstruction...

04:40.146 --> 04:42.910
through the Center for Missing
and Exploited Person database.

04:42.982 --> 04:45.712
- That's a lot of missing kids.
- <i>[Brennan] These arejust the locals.</i>

04:45.785 --> 04:48.253
- <i>[Booth] Let's hope we don't</i>
<i>have to go national.</i>
- <i>[Saroyan] Narrow the search...</i>

04:48.321 --> 04:50.016
to street kids in the foster system.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.579
Why?

04:51.658 --> 04:54.092
Because statistically,
that's where this boy comes from.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.321
It's far too early
to start narrowing our focus.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.728
Runaways, street kids,
foster system.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.028
Dr. Saroyan's the boss.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.866
I've autopsied a lot of dead kids...
car accidents, drug overdoses, drownings.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.098
<i>Fine. It's a broad search.</i>

05:07.173 --> 05:11.007
Kid in a Dumpster... it's a runaway,
street kid or foster system.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.011
Cam's right, Bones.

05:13.079 --> 05:16.708
Got it. Dylan Crane, 17.

05:16.783 --> 05:20.844
<i>This is why I was appointed this job,</i>
<i>Dr. Brennan... to streamline the process.</i>

05:20.920 --> 05:25.414
- Honor student from a nice
neighborhood in Alexandria.
- Oops.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.756
He disappeared three weeks ago
with his girlfriend, Kelly Morris...

05:28.828 --> 05:31.058
<i>who</i> is <i>in the foster system.</i>

05:31.130 --> 05:34.122
Good.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.862
There we go. I guess your first move
is to find Kelly Morris.

05:36.936 --> 05:42.465
No, the first move is to inform the Cranes
that we just found their son.

05:42.542 --> 05:46.672
- Are you positive?
- We don't need to <i>identify</i> him?
To make sure, I mean?

05:46.746 --> 05:48.680
I need to see my son.
You understand?

05:48.748 --> 05:51.216
Mr. and Mrs. Crane,
I realize this is very hard.

05:51.284 --> 05:54.117
But the reason why we asked you
to come to theJeffersonian...

05:54.187 --> 05:56.155
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

05:56.222 --> 05:58.383
I don't understand
the significance of that.

05:58.458 --> 06:03.987
I'm called in when a victim
is too decomposed to <i>identify.</i>

06:04.063 --> 06:05.724
Oh, God.

06:05.798 --> 06:11.065
I was able to <i>identify</i> Dylan
beyond the shadow of a doubt.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.605
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- That's Dylan.

06:13.673 --> 06:16.699
- How did he die?
- He fell...

06:16.776 --> 06:19.677
from a height of
approximately 50 feet.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.907
Suicide?

06:21.981 --> 06:25.348
Is there any reason to believe
that your son was despondent?

06:25.418 --> 06:27.352
Dylan? No.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.514
He was a smart, happy kid.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.150
Problems at school?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.854
You know, uh, spending too much time
on the Internet? Anything like that?

06:35.928 --> 06:38.795
His whole life centered around
this girl that he was seeing.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.332
Was this Kelly Morris?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.301
Yes. I suppose you read
the missing persons report.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.633
So you know Kelly's
in a foster situation?

06:45.705 --> 06:48.606
Have you seen her
since Dylan disappeared?

06:48.674 --> 06:51.871
- No.
- To be honest, we were hoping
they ran away together.

06:51.944 --> 06:55.311
- Why would they do that?
- We told Dylan to stop seeing her.

06:55.381 --> 06:56.939
Why?

06:57.016 --> 07:00.281
Dylan met her at Harbor Plaza
where the street kids hang out.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.651
Dylan was getting ready
to go to M.I.T.

07:02.722 --> 07:04.485
<i>She's already dropped out</i>
<i>ofhigh school.</i>

07:04.557 --> 07:06.855
The life we provided didn't
prepare him for a girl like Kelly.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.895
- You mean a foster child?
- Bones.

07:09.962 --> 07:13.159
Whatever happened to my son,
it happened because of Kelly.

07:13.232 --> 07:16.360
<i>We're going to find her,</i>
<i>and we're going to talk to her.</i>

07:16.436 --> 07:20.634
Dr. Brennan, I can see that you think
that we're being hard on Kelly.

07:20.706 --> 07:23.766
But my son...

07:23.843 --> 07:27.870
My son was a good kid
with his whole life ahead of him.

07:36.656 --> 07:39.216
Kelly Morris's foster mother's
gonna meet us in my office.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.226
Okay.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.957
She says Kelly took off a couple
weeks ago with most of her belongings.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.160
[Sighs]

07:48.234 --> 07:50.725
You okay, Bones?

07:50.803 --> 07:52.794
I was a foster child.

07:52.872 --> 07:55.363
Yeah, I know.

07:55.441 --> 07:57.466
Did people always assume
the worst of <i>me?</i>

07:57.543 --> 07:59.841
[Sighs] You know,
I know that you hate psychology.

07:59.912 --> 08:02.608
But those people...
They just lost their son.

08:02.682 --> 08:05.583
They need to blame someone.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.684
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Poor Dylan. He was a good kid.</i>

08:13.759 --> 08:16.626
He was a good influence on Kelly.

08:16.696 --> 08:20.063
<i>Trying to get her back into school.</i>
<i>And he was good to Alex.</i>

08:20.132 --> 08:23.124
<i>Treated him just like</i>
<i>a little brother.</i>

08:23.202 --> 08:26.365
To the best of your knowledge,
were Kelly and Dylan sexually active?

08:26.439 --> 08:28.839
Oh, I know they were.

08:28.908 --> 08:32.241
I'm afraid I caught them
in Kelly's bedroom.

08:32.311 --> 08:35.212
And I had to forbid Kelly to bring Dylan
into the house after that.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.273
- Why?
- It's the rules.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.751
They're underage,
and Kelly's a ward of the state.

08:40.820 --> 08:44.847
<i>And I knew that it might force Dylan and</i>
<i>Kelly to find other places to be together.</i>

08:44.924 --> 08:48.792
<i>You know, to feed into</i>
<i>their own, uh,</i> Romeo and Juliet <i>fantasy.</i>

08:48.861 --> 08:53.230
<i>But Alex lives in the house, too,</i>
<i>and he's only 12.</i>

08:53.299 --> 08:56.791
- Kelly and her brother, are they close?
- Very close.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.667
Their parents were killed
in a hotel fire four years ago.

08:59.739 --> 09:02.401
<i>They had no family.</i>
<i>They were put into the system.</i>

09:02.475 --> 09:05.444
I've had them for
a little over a year.

09:05.511 --> 09:08.002
That's a pretty good run
for a foster kid...

09:08.080 --> 09:10.480
especially a brother and a sister
who want to be together.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.575
Yes.

09:13.653 --> 09:14.984
What?

09:15.054 --> 09:19.388
<i>I'm not certain how much longer</i>
<i>I can keep the both of them.</i>

09:19.458 --> 09:23.986
I have diabetes. And I don't
have the energy that I used to.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.657
<i>And Kelly is a real handful.</i>

09:26.732 --> 09:29.360
I've asked Children's Services
to look for alternatives.

09:29.435 --> 09:33.030
- Did Kelly know?
- Yes. I told her.

09:33.105 --> 09:35.335
<i>[Boy]</i>
<i>Did they find Kelly or not?</i>

09:35.408 --> 09:38.673
No, Alex.
But they found Dylan.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.008
Is he all right?

09:44.383 --> 09:46.613
I'm-I'm afraid not.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.620
Dylan is dead.

09:52.391 --> 09:55.019
Do you know where Kelly is, Alex?

09:56.162 --> 09:59.063
- No.
- Kelly could be in danger.

09:59.131 --> 10:01.895
I don't know where she is.

10:01.968 --> 10:06.803
She hasn't called me or anything.
Do you think she's dead too?

10:06.872 --> 10:09.966
No. Mm-mmm. You know,
I'm gonna find your sister...

10:10.042 --> 10:12.374
and I'm gonna bring her
back here to you.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.003
Really?

10:14.080 --> 10:18.073
Mmm, absolutely.
This is the F.B.I., buddy.

10:20.319 --> 10:23.755
Were you lying to the boy? Do you really
think Kelly Morris is still alive?

10:23.823 --> 10:26.587
- I don't know.
- You don't know if she's alive?

10:26.659 --> 10:30.390
I don't know if I was lying. I really
don't have a read on the sister yet.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.931
I mean, was she a bad guy?
Was she a victim?

10:32.999 --> 10:34.933
Do you have a read on Dylan Crane?

10:35.001 --> 10:38.903
Oh, yeah. He had that whole adolescent
savior complex thing going on big time.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.769
- Savior complex?
- Yeah, teenage boys love nothing more...

10:41.841 --> 10:44.833
than the idea of saving
the damsel in distress.

10:44.910 --> 10:49.244
- How do you know?
- Well, 'cause I was, you know...
I was a teenage boy.

10:50.616 --> 10:53.847
<i>Hey. D.N.A. from the tissue under</i>
<i>the victim's fingernail.</i>

10:53.919 --> 10:56.615
Female. And there's nail polish
in the gouges on his arm.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.680
It wasn't necessarily
from the murder.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.692
They were sexually active.
She might've scratched him.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.854
Nope. Hodgins also found
oxidized iron in the scratches.

11:03.929 --> 11:07.797
- Oxidized iron. What's that?
- [Saroyan, Brennan] Rust.

11:07.867 --> 11:11.268
- Why didn't you just say rust?
- Well, <i>she</i> said it.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.636
The same oxidized iron found
on the victim's upper back and shoulder.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.198
Probably left behind
by the weapon that struck him.

11:17.276 --> 11:22.145
- So he was hit with what, a rusty pipe?
- That's a reasonable assumption.

11:22.214 --> 11:24.444
<i>Oh, so Dylan tells</i>
<i>the girlfriend they're breaking up.</i>

11:24.517 --> 11:27.315
- She whacks him across the carotid with a pipe.
- Pushes him out the window.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.377
- Exactly.
- What?

11:29.455 --> 11:32.219
<i>What's with the stink eye?</i>
<i>It's just a theory.</i>

11:32.291 --> 11:35.988
There was cheap nail polish
in the box of Kelly's belongings.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.996
You should see if there's a match.

11:38.064 --> 11:41.727
Find some hair.
Match the D.N.A. on that.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.769
- Then get started on the, uh, murder weapon.
- Yeah.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.100
<i>Where you going?</i>

11:46.172 --> 11:49.005
I thought before we arrest
Kelly Morris for murder...

11:49.075 --> 11:51.566
based solely on the fact
that she's a foster kid...

11:51.644 --> 11:55.171
we might want to find the place
where Dylan Crane actually died.

11:55.247 --> 11:58.444
<i>Point of fact, the pipe, if that's even</i>
<i>what it was, was not the murder weapon.</i>

11:58.517 --> 12:02.954
The evidence, if anybody cares,
shows that Dylan Crane died from a fall.

12:03.022 --> 12:05.115
[Whistles]

12:09.829 --> 12:12.491
No compression fractures
to the ulna or phalanges.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.193
So his arms weren't outstretched
or across his face.

12:15.267 --> 12:17.201
Which means he wasn't
bracing for impact.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.863
Suggesting he was unconscious
before he went out the window.

12:19.939 --> 12:22.032
Perhaps from being struck
by the rusty pipe?

12:22.108 --> 12:24.542
- [Grunts] Don't you start.
- Start what?

12:24.610 --> 12:28.239
- We don't know what he was struck with yet.
- I analyzed the impact damage...

12:28.314 --> 12:32.011
and the weapon was a cylinder
approximately two inches in diameter.

12:32.084 --> 12:37.522
That, plus the oxidation residue,
suggests, in the vernacular, a rusty pipe.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.890
Good. If you tell me that, I get it.
It's empirical, not guesswork.

12:41.961 --> 12:46.364
<i>That which we call a rose</i>
<i>by any other name would smell as sweet.</i>

12:46.432 --> 12:48.366
<i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>
act 2, scene 2...

12:48.434 --> 12:52.370
the quote considered to most aptly
describe the central conflict of the play...

12:52.438 --> 12:54.668
which I totally do not understand.

12:54.740 --> 12:58.471
The flower in Dylan's hand
was a <i>Rosea calyx...</i> a rosebud.

12:58.544 --> 13:01.308
You do <i>not</i> smell like a rose.

13:01.380 --> 13:05.373
I've been sifting through two tons of
garbage, which you should ask me about.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.510
Ask what exactly?

13:07.586 --> 13:10.214
Poultry skin loaded
with garlic and chives, red beets...

13:10.289 --> 13:13.315
empty imported vodka bottles,
and traces of osetra fish eggs.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.326
Put 'em together and where are we?

13:15.394 --> 13:17.885
<i>Anyone?</i>

13:19.465 --> 13:23.162
Booth should check the garbage truck
route for a Russian restaurant.

13:25.838 --> 13:28.636
- <i>[Vehicles Passing]</i>
- Whoa, okay. Horrible area.

13:28.707 --> 13:32.199
But on the upside, only one
Russian restaurant and no Starbucks.

13:32.278 --> 13:36.339
You know, no one we've talked to
has recognized either Kelly or Dylan.

13:36.415 --> 13:39.441
- Hey, we could ask them.
- Why?

13:39.518 --> 13:44.615
Because they share the same unique
sociocultural identifiers as Kelly Morris.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.215
- You mean like teenagers?
- Yeah, exactly.

13:47.293 --> 13:50.626
No, you know what? They will melt away
before we get half a sentence out.

13:50.696 --> 13:53.597
- Right. You just watch.
- Okay. But, hey, you know, what do I know?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.066
- I've only been working the streets
my whole career.
- <i>Excuse me?</i>

13:56.135 --> 13:58.069
Excuse me? Hello.

13:58.137 --> 14:02.597
- Hi. I'm an anthropologist. I'm not a cop.
- That's most definitely a cop.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.973
<i>Thank you. See?</i>
<i>They're very cooperative, aren't they?</i>

14:05.044 --> 14:06.978
- Booth, please...
- There they go.

14:07.046 --> 14:09.879
Oh, excuse me.
Wait, wait, wait.

14:09.949 --> 14:14.443
Will you just take a look at these pictures
and tell me if you recognize anyone?

14:16.055 --> 14:18.285
<i>Give me five bucks,</i>
<i>and I'll tell you.</i>

14:18.357 --> 14:22.225
- Five bucks.
- Booth, please.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.894
Here you go.

14:25.965 --> 14:27.330
So who is it?

14:27.399 --> 14:30.459
It's his sister.
But hold it this way, right?

14:30.536 --> 14:33.903
'Cause the only time anyone
ever sees his sister is on her back.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.601
<i>Yeah. I'm assuming</i>
<i>this isn't your sister?</i>

14:38.677 --> 14:42.943
- No, it is!
- Okay, I'd like my money back.

14:43.015 --> 14:45.313
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Well, there they go. Bye.</i>

14:45.384 --> 14:48.251
<i>Mm-hmm. That really worked,</i>
<i>now, didn't it, huh?</i>

14:48.320 --> 14:50.811
Great.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.824
They just took my money for nothing.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.350
Well, you know, that's because they're
exploited, you know, misunderstood.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.495
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Oh, you gotta be kidding me, huh?</i>

15:01.567 --> 15:05.765
- I mean, they could at least wait
until my back is turned, right?
- What?

15:05.838 --> 15:07.772
- <i>F.B.I. Hands in the air.</i>
- Cops!

15:07.840 --> 15:11.003
There's no problem here!
No problem at all. Katie!

15:13.178 --> 15:15.806
I'll cover you.
Go see what they're dealing, Bones.

15:15.881 --> 15:19.009
I hate this part where you stand
with a gun and I have to do the looking.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.052
Bones, I got you covered. Just go.

15:24.356 --> 15:26.881
<i>What are you selling?</i>

15:26.959 --> 15:29.484
What do they got there, Bones?
What do you got, huh?

15:29.561 --> 15:33.053
Ibuprofen, uh, multivitamin.

15:33.132 --> 15:37.660
<i>I think these are sandwiches.</i>
<i>And condoms.</i>

15:40.940 --> 15:43.340
[Man] Franny and I have been
doing this for years.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.468
[Franny]
Sandwiches, clothing, vitamins.

15:45.544 --> 15:48.672
Some basic hygiene supplies
for homeless kids.

15:48.747 --> 15:52.239
- You must be really embarrassed.
- Hey, you know what? It was
suspicious behavior, all right?

15:52.318 --> 15:55.151
And besides, it's not like they're...
Are you social workers?

15:55.220 --> 15:57.654
- Nope.
- They aren't social workers.

15:57.723 --> 16:00.089
- They're good Samaritans.
- Well, I apologized, okay?

16:00.159 --> 16:02.627
Do you know how long it takes
to gain trust around here?

16:02.695 --> 16:05.528
Make a scene like this,
and these kids won't talk to us for weeks.

16:05.597 --> 16:09.829
Oh, good. Maybe you could do us
a favor in return. Show him the picture.

16:09.902 --> 16:13.770
We're looking for someone. A girl.

16:13.839 --> 16:17.036
- Dylan and Kelly.
- Yeah. That's right.

16:17.109 --> 16:20.510
- We haven't seen 'em around here
in a couple of weeks.
- Dylan is dead.

16:20.579 --> 16:24.106
<i>We found him in a garbage truck</i>
<i>that services this area.</i>

16:24.183 --> 16:27.584
- My God. What happened?
- That's what we're trying to figure out.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.348
Warehouse.

16:31.090 --> 16:34.116
Yep. Come with us.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.296
- What is this place?
- A squat.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.525
Every one of these old factories
houses junkies and squatters.

16:40.599 --> 16:42.533
Yeah, and kids
with nowhere else to go.

16:42.601 --> 16:44.125
What'd this building used to be?

16:44.203 --> 16:46.967
- Plumbing supply, I think.
- Pipes.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.599
Bones. Dylan, right?

16:55.781 --> 16:58.079
It's obviously a kind of shrine.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.612
<i>It's something the kids do</i>
<i>for each other when somebody dies.</i>

17:02.688 --> 17:05.885
Still could be traces of Dylan's blood on
the concrete. I'll call the crime scene unit.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.654
- Tell them to start on the fifth floor.
- Why?

17:08.727 --> 17:10.752
Because the injuries show
that's how far he fell.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.660
- <i>[Glass Shatters]</i>
- [Boy Grunts]

17:12.731 --> 17:17.599
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
That's Dylan's school jacket!

17:17.669 --> 17:21.435
We're not gonna hurt you!
[Groans]

17:22.641 --> 17:25.234
Okay.
I hurt you a little bit...

17:25.310 --> 17:27.608
but that's only because you ran.

17:30.716 --> 17:34.880
You can't ask me nothing without a social
worker present. I know my rights.

17:34.953 --> 17:38.753
I'm not questioning you.
We're just... We're talking, okay?

17:38.824 --> 17:41.486
Here, want some gum?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.586
Yeah, like that's gonna
make me trust you.

17:46.832 --> 17:49.266
You know, I'm just asking your name.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.598
- <i>[Man] Sergeant Roberts is up top.</i>
- "C."

17:51.670 --> 17:54.639
- Does that stand for anything?
- Carter.

17:54.706 --> 17:57.140
I'm not saying if that's
my first or my last name.

17:57.209 --> 17:59.200
- Why'd you run?
- Because this lady was chasing me.

17:59.278 --> 18:01.838
- Because you ran.
- Yeah. It's a brain twister.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.008
<i>You know, that sweatshirt you're wearing</i>
<i>belongs to a kid by the name of Dylan Crane.</i>

18:05.084 --> 18:07.518
- Never heard of him.
- Where'd you get it?

18:09.621 --> 18:12.681
I'm done with the hoodie.
You guys can have it.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.858
What's with the names on the inside
of your forearm there? What does that mean?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.364
Guys I killed.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.799
It's a list of foster homes.
Ones that threw him out.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.360
Sometimes getting thrown out's
the best...

18:26.438 --> 18:29.566
It's the best thing that can happen.
I know.

18:31.076 --> 18:33.909
You were in the system?

18:36.315 --> 18:41.150
Booth, the sunglasses? They're the same ones
that Dylan was wearing in the photograph.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.553
These, huh? Top of the line.
How can you afford these?

18:44.623 --> 18:47.353
You don't want to know.
Can I go now?

18:47.426 --> 18:49.758
No. Child Services is on the way.

18:49.828 --> 18:51.659
I tell you something, you let me go?

18:51.730 --> 18:54.096
- Try me.
- You want to know what happened
to Dylan and Kelly?

18:54.166 --> 18:56.100
Check out the sandwich pervs.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.367
<i>Fran Duncan's clean.</i>
<i>Great record in the community.</i>

19:00.439 --> 19:03.135
But Kevin Duncan?
The kid got it right. I mean, he's a perv.

19:03.208 --> 19:06.109
Inside three times
on "solicitation of minor" charges.

19:06.178 --> 19:09.011
- Boys or girls?
- Girls. He's a traditionalist.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.914
[Sighs]
So, he went after Kelly.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.612
The white knight from the suburbs
steps in, gets conked with a pipe...

19:14.686 --> 19:17.814
- and tossed out the window.
- And Kelly goes into hiding.

19:17.890 --> 19:21.121
Unless he got her too.
So what do you want to do next?

19:21.193 --> 19:23.218
Hmm. That's up to Cam, isn't it?

19:23.295 --> 19:27.629
No, Bones, I asked you.
What do you want to do?

19:28.934 --> 19:30.959
I think...

19:31.036 --> 19:34.335
I think we shouldn't close off
any avenue of investigation.

19:34.406 --> 19:37.534
We stay on all the evidence
and see where it leads us.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.543
Like we did before Cam.

19:39.611 --> 19:42.409
Okay.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.976
Do you have a list like Carter?

19:46.051 --> 19:50.078
Of foster families that didn't work out?
Yeah. We all did.

19:50.155 --> 19:54.216
- I wrote mine on the bottom of a shoe.
- Oh.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.761
You know, they say with foster kids,
they're really hard on themselves.

19:56.828 --> 19:58.386
They?

19:58.463 --> 20:02.763
Yeah, experts, psychologists,
like that.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.803
<i>Apparently, foster kids feel</i>
<i>so alone in this mean world...</i>

20:05.871 --> 20:09.238
they lose that knack
of trusting other people.

20:09.308 --> 20:10.969
You mean at work?

20:11.043 --> 20:13.307
Uh, everywhere.
You know, weight of the world.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.074
It's... It's profound.

20:16.148 --> 20:19.117
<i>They say that they have a hard time</i>
<i>letting themselves off the hook.</i>

20:19.184 --> 20:22.347
They... They grow up with control issues.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.981
- Are you telling me something, Booth?
- <i>No.</i>

20:25.057 --> 20:28.424
I'm just saying it's something to keep in
consideration when we catch up with Kelly Morris.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.427
Okay.

20:30.495 --> 20:34.591
If you decide to take some other wisdom
out of it, none of my business.

20:34.666 --> 20:37.965
How Cam and I get along
<i>is</i> none of your business.

20:38.036 --> 20:39.970
Yeah, right.
Which I just said.

20:40.038 --> 20:43.701
Said just then... None of my business.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.142
[Computer Beeping]

20:58.290 --> 21:00.224
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

21:00.292 --> 21:02.385
Hey, this schematic is great, Angela.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.725
<i>All the pipes</i>
<i>are numbered and located.</i>

21:04.796 --> 21:07.162
Meanwhile, I have hundreds
of rust samples...

21:07.232 --> 21:09.598
and I've covered, mmm,
maybe a quarter of the crime scene.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.329
- [Groans]
- Yeah.

21:11.403 --> 21:15.533
On the good side, that is definitely
the window Dylan Crane exited as he fell.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.871
Leaded glass is a match.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.003
It's a strange place
for two people in love to end up.

21:21.079 --> 21:23.138
What? A forensics lab?

21:23.215 --> 21:27.208
No. A squat in
an abandoned pipe factory.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.277
Right. Yes. Right.

21:30.355 --> 21:32.687
What were <i>you</i> talking about?

21:32.758 --> 21:35.591
- Just Cam and Booth, you know, of course.
- Oh, yeah.

21:35.661 --> 21:38.687
- Given their... their history.
- Mmm.

21:41.066 --> 21:43.000
Tension, party of two.

21:47.939 --> 21:49.873
Great. Great.

21:49.941 --> 21:51.875
[Groans]
Okay.

21:53.278 --> 21:55.940
All my mistakes were made
before I met Fran.

21:58.617 --> 22:01.142
Then I fell in love.
Love changes everything.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.710
- Your wife know about these mistakes?
- Of course.

22:03.789 --> 22:07.054
We have no secrets. I got counseling.
I'm still in counseling.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.423
I'm out there on the street
making amends every day.

22:09.494 --> 22:13.590
Passing out sandwiches and aspirin
and condoms to street kids?

22:13.665 --> 22:17.761
Yeah. I have no direct contact with the kids.
Fran does.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.031
<i>I make the sandwiches.</i>

22:20.105 --> 22:24.098
I drive. Insure my wife's safety.
That's a tough part of town.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.475
And your past is all in the past?

22:27.546 --> 22:30.447
No. That's with me every day.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.449
Yeah.

22:33.885 --> 22:37.252
Miranda Tyler, Susan Price,
Laura Costello.

22:37.322 --> 22:41.418
All these girls say that you traded
sandwiches for sex in the past six months.

22:41.493 --> 22:43.427
Well, they're street kids.
They lie.

22:43.495 --> 22:47.295
- Yeah.
- <i>These girls came on to me.</i>

22:47.366 --> 22:49.334
And they wanted money.

22:49.401 --> 22:51.596
When I rejected them,
they got angry.

22:51.670 --> 22:56.107
We catch up to Kelly Morris, is
she gonna say the same thing?

23:00.545 --> 23:03.343
<i>Hairbrush from Kelly's room</i>
<i>provided her D.N.A.</i>

23:03.415 --> 23:05.679
The nail polish from her room
also matches...

23:05.751 --> 23:08.743
the nail polish we found in
the scratch marks on the victim's arm.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.583
It doesn't mean
she pushed him out that window.

23:10.655 --> 23:13.954
<i>lfhe finds it, and it matches the rust</i>
<i>found in the scratch marks...</i>

23:14.025 --> 23:16.960
- then we can tie Kelly to the weapon.
- Oh, young love.

23:17.028 --> 23:19.360
You pour your soul out
to some pimple-faced jock...

23:19.431 --> 23:22.525
with a great body and the emotional
maturity of an 11 -year-old...

23:22.601 --> 23:25.866
only to get your heart broken
in the back of a red Camaro.

23:25.937 --> 23:28.599
- Remember that first slow dance?
- Oh, God.

23:28.673 --> 23:32.336
- Some horrible power ballad.
- Oh, that special boy with a pipe in his pocket.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.778
Oh, God. Lewis Cole.

23:35.847 --> 23:39.010
<i>Mmm. He was a drummer.</i>
<i>He had this hair. It was...</i>

23:39.084 --> 23:42.520
Wait. Excuse me? Marching to the beat
of a different drummer here.

23:42.587 --> 23:46.648
I'd like Hodgins to <i>identify</i> the species
of rose found in Dylan Crane's hand.

23:46.725 --> 23:50.161
- What can that possibly tell us?
- I won't know until he identifies it.

23:50.228 --> 23:54.392
I'd prefer he keep looking for the pipe.
It could have Kevin Dylan's D.N.A. on it.

23:54.466 --> 23:57.867
Which will prove only that Kevin Duncan
struck Dylan, not that he killed him.

23:57.936 --> 24:01.337
- I want Hodgins on that rose.
- It's my call. No.

24:01.406 --> 24:04.842
[Sighs]
I can't work like this.

24:04.910 --> 24:08.311
Are you telling me I should
start looking for your replacement?

24:08.380 --> 24:11.543
<i>Dr. Saroyan, I don't want to be</i>
<i>overly dramatic or anything.</i>

24:11.616 --> 24:15.074
But if you lose Brennan,
you lose us all.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.981
- Really?
- Really.

24:20.058 --> 24:22.219
And Booth too.

24:26.598 --> 24:31.865
In the interests of this investigation,
I'm going to defer to you, Dr. Brennan.

24:31.937 --> 24:35.737
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

24:35.807 --> 24:39.140
But I will start the search
for your replacement.

24:46.418 --> 24:48.352
- <i>[Man] Agent Booth?</i>
- Yeah?

24:48.420 --> 24:51.856
This young man says he has information
he won't tell anyone but you.

24:51.923 --> 24:54.255
All right.
Thanks, I got it.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.954
Come on in, Alex.
Have a seat.

24:57.028 --> 24:59.223
[Sighs]

25:01.199 --> 25:04.430
- You want a Coke or anything?
- No.

25:06.605 --> 25:10.871
- You a big shot?
- [Scoffs] Uh, yeah.

25:10.942 --> 25:14.639
Look at that, huh?
Special Agent <i>in Charge</i> Seeley Booth.

25:16.481 --> 25:20.440
- So how'd you get here?
- Bus.

25:20.519 --> 25:24.546
- Kelly called me on the phone.
- What'd she say?

25:24.623 --> 25:27.888
That she's okay.

25:27.959 --> 25:31.759
And that we'll be together...
soon.

25:31.830 --> 25:34.162
Did she say where she was?

25:36.368 --> 25:38.996
Did she know about Dylan?
About being dead?

25:40.171 --> 25:44.904
Yeah. She couldn't
stop crying about it.

25:47.579 --> 25:49.513
She had to hang up.

25:51.016 --> 25:52.950
<i>I think she's lying.</i>

25:53.018 --> 25:55.782
<i>I think she's never coming back.</i>
<i>[Sniffles]</i>

26:00.992 --> 26:03.517
Hey, it's okay, Alex.
All right?

26:03.595 --> 26:05.756
Everything's gonna be okay.

26:05.830 --> 26:08.594
[Crying]
I think I'm all alone now.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.760
No. Hey, look.

26:10.835 --> 26:13.668
Hey, man, you're never
gonna be alone, okay?

26:13.738 --> 26:15.899
All right, we know for certain
that Kelly is alive.

26:15.974 --> 26:19.307
And I promise.
We're gonna find your sister.

26:20.378 --> 26:22.972
Okay? All right.

26:23.048 --> 26:26.142
Let's get out of here.
I'll give you a ride home.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.811
- I got your call.
- It was urgent. Why didn't you answer?

26:30.889 --> 26:32.823
I was busy.
What's so important?

26:35.260 --> 26:38.457
- Kevin Duncan.
- Single gunshot wound to the chest.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.624
You're just in time for the autopsy.

26:52.577 --> 26:54.511
Feeling queasy, Zack?

26:54.579 --> 26:58.208
I'm not used to bodies looking so much
like actual human beings.

26:58.283 --> 27:01.309
[Saw Whirring]

27:01.386 --> 27:03.320
- <i>[Bone Cracking]</i>
- [Groans]

27:03.388 --> 27:06.789
Since this man was just killed
and there's plenty of flesh...

27:06.858 --> 27:09.349
how is my presence beneficial?

27:14.332 --> 27:15.697
<i>[Bone Cracking]</i>

27:22.273 --> 27:24.207
The number six rib.

27:24.275 --> 27:28.075
<i>The bullet passed through his vital organs</i>
<i>and lodged in the rear curvature.</i>

27:29.514 --> 27:31.539
Get it out.

27:33.585 --> 27:37.180
So, you're thinking the perv kills Romeo
and Juliet kills the pervert.

27:37.255 --> 27:40.281
Street-smart kid like Kelly Morris
would have no trouble getting a gun.

27:40.358 --> 27:41.791
Mm-hmm.

27:43.061 --> 27:45.495
Booth, if Dr. Brennan
were to quit...

27:46.865 --> 27:50.028
- What?
- If she were to leave theJeffersonian...

27:50.101 --> 27:53.537
Well, the squints would flee
this institution like the French army.

27:53.605 --> 27:57.439
- And you?
- Well, I do as I'm ordered.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.477
[Scoffs]
No, you don't, Seeley.

28:01.279 --> 28:04.737
Okay, here we go.
What's going on, Camille?

28:06.518 --> 28:09.316
What if I fired her?
What would you do?

28:11.022 --> 28:14.753
I'm with Bones, Cam.
All the way.

28:14.826 --> 28:16.794
Don't doubt it for a second.

28:18.163 --> 28:20.563
Meet the English Alba Rose.

28:20.632 --> 28:23.658
Climbing varietal.
Nonexistent in the United States.

28:23.735 --> 28:27.967
<i>Some say it was the rose by any other name</i>
<i>Shakespeare wrote about.</i>

28:28.039 --> 28:30.132
And we give a rat's ass because?

28:30.208 --> 28:32.506
It's what Dylan Crane was
clutching in his cold, dead hand.

28:32.577 --> 28:34.408
So, what?
He was killed by Hamlet?

28:34.479 --> 28:36.413
Wrong play.

28:36.481 --> 28:40.315
It's more likely he paid a visit to the rose wing
of the United States Botanic Garden.

28:40.385 --> 28:44.014
When it comes to bugs, slime,
crud, and compost, you're the man.

28:45.423 --> 28:48.051
- [Chuckles]
- <i>Look, Cam.</i>

28:48.126 --> 28:51.186
<i>Maybe you just got off on the wrong foot</i>
<i>with this case with Brennan...</i>

28:51.262 --> 28:53.958
because, uh, she was a foster kid.

28:55.433 --> 29:00.336
<i>Oh. [Sighs]</i>
<i>Why didn't she tell me?</i>

29:00.405 --> 29:03.499
She doesn't do that.
[Clears Throat] Excuse me.

29:03.575 --> 29:07.807
Oh, by the way,
I didn't just tell you that.

29:11.049 --> 29:13.882
<i>[Hodgins] United States Botanic Garden</i>
<i>falls under the supervision...</i>

29:13.952 --> 29:16.147
- of the Architect of the Capitol.
- I really don't care.

29:16.221 --> 29:18.155
The architect is also responsible...

29:18.223 --> 29:20.157
for maintaining the grounds
of the United States Capitol.

29:20.225 --> 29:22.159
You seen either of these two kids?

29:22.227 --> 29:25.196
It's open every day of the year to the citizens
of these United States.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.197
Which way to
the <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> roses?

29:27.265 --> 29:29.495
It's over there
where Kelly Morris is standing.

29:33.238 --> 29:36.469
Oh, Bones was right.
Okay, go distract her.

29:36.541 --> 29:39.476
- Well, hey. Why me?
- Well, because apparently I look like a cop.

29:39.544 --> 29:43.036
- What do I look like?
- What are you? My straight man? Go.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.156
Hey.

29:54.492 --> 29:57.552
The United States Botanic Garden
falls under...

29:57.629 --> 30:00.894
the supervision of
the Architect of the Capitol.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.956
- Get away from me, perv.
- Hello, Kelly.

30:03.034 --> 30:05.161
F.B.I.
Not a perv.

30:05.236 --> 30:08.728
It's okay. It's okay.
We're just here to help.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.038
Not gonna hurt you. Just gotta
talk about what happened to Dylan.

30:13.178 --> 30:15.112
Dylan's dead.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.080
Were you there when Dylan died?

30:17.148 --> 30:19.343
Was I there?

30:21.586 --> 30:23.884
Who do you think killed him?

30:30.495 --> 30:33.089
- Why'd you kill Dylan, Kelly?
- Agent Booth.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.859
She already admitted to the murder,
Ms. Child.

30:34.933 --> 30:37.424
Actually, I believe she asked
"Who do you think killed him?"

30:37.502 --> 30:42.303
- It's an ambiguous question.
- Oh, I killed him. I did it.

30:43.708 --> 30:45.972
Because he broke a promise to me.

30:46.044 --> 30:47.807
The promise to stay with you?

30:47.879 --> 30:51.042
He tossed me a couple hundred bucks
and told me he was going to college...

30:51.115 --> 30:53.083
that we couldn't
see each other anymore.

30:53.151 --> 30:56.746
- What'd you do?
- I pushed him out a window.

30:56.821 --> 31:00.313
<i>It was kind of an accident, right?</i>
<i>What do you call it? A crime of passion?</i>

31:00.391 --> 31:03.258
- You pushed him out the window?
- Yes.

31:03.328 --> 31:04.989
And he was conscious at the time?

31:05.063 --> 31:07.258
Yeah. He screamed, okay?

31:09.801 --> 31:12.668
- What then?
- I ran away.

31:12.737 --> 31:14.830
No. Kelly, you didn't.

31:14.906 --> 31:18.000
You went down to the alley,
and you wrapped Dylan in linen.

31:18.076 --> 31:21.944
<i>And then you put a rose from</i>
<i>the Botanic Garden in his hand.</i>

31:22.013 --> 31:24.004
The <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> rose.

31:24.082 --> 31:28.416
<i>You know, it's a strange thing to do</i>
<i>right after you murder someone.</i>

31:28.486 --> 31:30.750
Well, I'm pretty screwed up.
Didn't you hear?

31:30.822 --> 31:32.813
Someone shot Kevin Duncan.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.825
- <i>He's dead.</i>
- The sandwich guy?

31:34.893 --> 31:37.794
We were thinking that
the two deaths were connected.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.458
[Sighs]
Fine. Yeah, I killed him too.

31:43.534 --> 31:47.698
- She killed him too.
- I'd prefer that we not pursue
this line of questioning.

31:55.013 --> 31:57.208
<i>[Register Beeping]</i>

31:57.282 --> 32:00.809
- Well, she confessed.
- She got it wrong. She forgot about the pipe.

32:00.885 --> 32:03.149
- She said they fought.
- She's lying.

32:03.221 --> 32:05.883
[Sighs] You know, I'm just trying
to think of a situation so bad...

32:05.957 --> 32:09.290
where a girl would confess to murder
to try and get out of it.

32:11.062 --> 32:14.691
- Agent Booth. Dr. Brennan.
- Mrs. Duncan.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.859
You want to sit down?
Have a cup of coffee?

32:16.935 --> 32:18.960
No, thank you.

32:19.037 --> 32:21.164
I'm sorry for your loss.

32:21.239 --> 32:25.039
- Did Kelly Morris kill Dylan?
- Well, she confessed.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.407
And now you think
she killed my husband as well?

32:27.478 --> 32:31.073
It's very possible. I'd believe that
before I believed she killed Dylan.

32:31.149 --> 32:33.344
Kelly shouldn't take the blame.

32:41.192 --> 32:43.251
<i>You'll find one bullet missing.</i>

32:45.196 --> 32:47.221
You're confessing to
your husband's murder?

32:48.766 --> 32:51.234
He used me to get close
to young girls.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.532
I don't know how many
through the years.

32:58.109 --> 33:00.669
Frances Duncan, you're under arrest.

33:00.745 --> 33:03.680
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used...

33:03.748 --> 33:06.046
Thank you.

33:06.117 --> 33:08.051
You have the right to an attorney.

33:08.119 --> 33:10.587
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be... Pick up the gun.

33:13.257 --> 33:17.023
Ballistics confirm that the bullet that killed
Kevin Duncan came from Fran Duncan's gun.

33:17.095 --> 33:19.029
- Case closed?
- On Kevin Duncan, definitely.

33:19.097 --> 33:21.031
Since Kelly Morris has confessed...

33:21.099 --> 33:24.557
- No. She didn't do it.
- What evidence do you have of that?

33:24.635 --> 33:30.232
<i>How about this? Specimen 268...</i>
<i>"right corner of the room" schematic.</i>

33:30.308 --> 33:34.108
- You are good.
- Oh, you have no idea.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.702
Are you having a moment?

33:35.780 --> 33:39.272
<i>Well, how does finding the pipe</i>
<i>prove that Kelly Morris is lying?</i>

33:39.350 --> 33:41.545
How does her confession not
include the murder weapon?

33:41.619 --> 33:44.144
Now for the last time, the pipe
is not the murder weapon.

33:44.222 --> 33:46.156
Dylan Crane died
from a 50-foot fall.

33:46.224 --> 33:51.218
Can you run the scenario through your
magic holographic crystal ball thingy?

33:51.295 --> 33:54.162
Too many variables.
But I have another idea.

33:55.633 --> 33:58.761
Okay.
Booth, you're Dylan Crane.

33:58.836 --> 34:01.100
- Okay, you know what? I'm out the door.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:01.172 --> 34:03.197
- Cam?
- Kelly Morris. Right.

34:03.274 --> 34:05.606
- Okay, I feel stupid.
- Okay, you two.

34:05.676 --> 34:09.077
You are young. You are in love.
You're about to break up.

34:09.147 --> 34:12.411
<i>But this is very tragic.</i>
<i>It's very emotionally fraught.</i>

34:12.483 --> 34:16.920
<i>Kelly Morris says she argued with Dylan</i>
<i>and pushed him out the window.</i>

34:16.987 --> 34:19.684
She pushed him, then tried to save him
by grabbing his arm?

34:19.757 --> 34:22.190
That would explain the fingernail polish
and the scratch. But...

34:22.260 --> 34:24.592
<i>Not the oxidized iron.</i>

34:24.661 --> 34:27.187
<i>Kelly would've had to strike him</i>
<i>with the pipe from behind...</i>

34:27.264 --> 34:29.165
<i>and then drive him</i>
<i>through the glass.</i>

34:29.233 --> 34:31.996
But she said that
they were arguing face-to-face.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.971
- <i>He would've seen her coming.</i>
- <i>That means there had to be a third person.</i>

34:35.039 --> 34:37.007
Someone who snuck up behind him.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.235
- Guys, I need a Kevin Duncan.
- I'll do it.

34:39.310 --> 34:42.210
Kelly already called me a perv,
so I have my motivation.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.840
So Kevin strikes Dylan
with the pipe.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.210
- Careful.
- Which moves him forward.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.219
Kelly grabs the pipe away from him.

34:50.288 --> 34:52.552
But Dylan is losing consciousness.

34:52.623 --> 34:55.489
He didn't have to throw Dylan out
the window. He could've simply pushed him.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.721
- Easy.
- Kelly grabs his arm.

34:59.564 --> 35:03.295
- <i>[Brennan] To save him.</i>
- Which would put fingernails
and rust in the wound.

35:03.367 --> 35:05.733
But she can't hold him,
and he falls.

35:05.803 --> 35:08.533
<i>[Glass Shatters]</i>

35:08.606 --> 35:11.905
- Oh!
- Well, that theory explains the physical evidence.

35:11.976 --> 35:17.676
<i>Except why would Kelly confess to murder</i>
<i>to protect Kevin Duncan?</i>

35:17.748 --> 35:20.216
- She's afraid of him.
- But she knows he's dead.

35:21.919 --> 35:26.015
Guys, there's only
two people in this world...

35:26.090 --> 35:30.083
that Kelly Morris would cover for.

35:30.161 --> 35:32.356
One of them went out that window.

35:32.563 --> 35:35.862
- We know you didn't kill Dylan.
- I did too.

35:35.933 --> 35:37.992
Kelly, I don't want you
to admit to anything more.

35:38.069 --> 35:43.006
No. You didn't. We can prove
there was a third person there...

35:43.074 --> 35:46.271
the third person that
hit Dylan with a pipe...

35:46.344 --> 35:50.110
and... when you took away the pipe...
pushed him through the glass.

35:50.181 --> 35:54.242
No, it was just me. I hit him with the pipe.
I pushed him through the glass.

35:54.318 --> 35:57.685
- No. You grabbed his arm. You tried to save him.
- No.

36:11.402 --> 36:17.307
Dylan made you feel like you weren't
alone in this world, right?

36:18.709 --> 36:21.576
He was sweet to you.

36:21.646 --> 36:24.945
He took so much weight
off your shoulders.

36:26.284 --> 36:30.050
He was good to Alex.

36:30.121 --> 36:36.082
And when Dylan said that you'd be
together always, you believed him.

36:38.396 --> 36:42.264
Yes. Yes, I believed him.

36:42.333 --> 36:47.464
And when Suzanne couldn't
take care of both you and Alex...

36:47.538 --> 36:50.336
you had an idea.

36:50.408 --> 36:54.310
Run away with Dylan.

36:54.378 --> 36:57.745
Maybe Suzanne will keep Alex...

36:57.815 --> 37:00.579
and everybody would be happy.

37:02.753 --> 37:05.586
Dylan loved me.

37:05.656 --> 37:08.250
I know.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.025
But I didn't tell Alex.

37:14.031 --> 37:16.329
He just...
[Sniffles]

37:16.400 --> 37:21.064
He just... He thought that Dylan was
trying to take me away from him forever.

37:24.175 --> 37:27.975
I... I did it all wrong. It's not...

37:28.045 --> 37:31.014
It's not Alex's fault.
It's my fault.

37:32.583 --> 37:35.074
<i>[Crying]</i>

37:37.455 --> 37:41.858
Kelly, you're 15 years old.

37:43.327 --> 37:45.318
This is not your fault.

37:47.832 --> 37:51.893
<i>The weight of the world</i>
<i>is not on your shoulders.</i>

37:54.238 --> 37:57.366
And we can't let you pay

38:36.947 --> 38:41.646
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

38:41.719 --> 38:44.415
I didn't tell them.
They just...

38:44.488 --> 38:46.422
They just knew.

38:48.092 --> 38:52.188
It's okay. [Sniffles]
Sorry about Dylan.

39:06.577 --> 39:09.273

40:23.587 --> 40:25.521
You were right about the pipe.

40:27.725 --> 40:29.659
You were right about the rose.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.987
Could I sit for a moment?

40:35.366 --> 40:38.733
<i>I wish you'd eat some of these fries.</i>
<i>Save me from myself.</i>

40:39.904 --> 40:41.929
They're really good
with garlic mayonnaise.

40:43.207 --> 40:47.735
- We have a problem.
- Uh-huh.

40:47.812 --> 40:53.580
- Do you see a solution?
- It's not completely my fault.

40:56.587 --> 41:00.751
I was a foster child.
And apparently...

41:00.825 --> 41:03.191
Booth says that...

41:03.260 --> 41:05.490
Booth says that I have...

41:05.563 --> 41:09.329
Well, something about control issues
and the weight of the world.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.028
[Chuckles]
That sounds like Booth.

41:12.102 --> 41:15.128
I think he meant that...

41:15.206 --> 41:17.936
if I'm going to share responsibility
for these cases...

41:18.008 --> 41:22.172
I'm going to have to learn to stop
controlling everything too.

41:22.246 --> 41:26.046
Does that make sense?
Psychology's not...

41:26.116 --> 41:30.280
I really... I really hate psychology.

41:30.354 --> 41:34.450
Not everyone's brain
works as fast as yours.

41:34.525 --> 41:37.517
I have to mull sometimes.

41:37.595 --> 41:39.620
A-Are you familiar
with that concept?

41:39.697 --> 41:42.860
Yes. I just always thought
it was a waste of time.

41:42.933 --> 41:45.834
[Chuckles]

41:45.903 --> 41:49.361
I'm in charge. But out of
respect for you, I could extend...

41:49.440 --> 41:52.671
- Did you ever play Monopoly?
- No.

41:52.743 --> 41:55.769
Well, they have this thing called
a"get out of jail free" card.

41:55.846 --> 41:58.815
Think of it as a free pass to <i>defy</i> me.

41:58.883 --> 42:03.252
No explanation needed.
No recriminations. No repercussions.

42:04.722 --> 42:07.589
Well, how... How many would I get?

42:07.658 --> 42:10.923
- One a week.
- Five per case.

42:10.995 --> 42:13.486
Three per week.

42:18.469 --> 42:21.165
Booth told you
I was a foster kid, didn't he?

42:22.806 --> 42:27.834
Okay, yes, he did,
but he did it with a good heart.

42:27.912 --> 42:32.144
And I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't let him know. Please.

42:32.216 --> 42:35.583
He's gonna know that you told me
the second he sees us together.

42:35.653 --> 42:38.087
It's true. He's awful like that.

42:38.155 --> 42:42.990
He reads people the way that you read
pathology reports or I read bones.

42:43.060 --> 42:46.461
Oh, God, I know. I hate him.
Well, I don't really.

42:46.530 --> 42:50.899
I know. Me either.

42:50.968 --> 42:54.301
- I will take you up on this.
- Please help me.
