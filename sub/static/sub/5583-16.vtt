WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.504
Previously on Empire...

00:03.537 --> 00:05.005
Will you marry me?
Yes.

00:05.039 --> 00:06.974
(crowd cheers)

00:07.007 --> 00:08.342
If only Cookie
knew what you did

00:08.376 --> 00:09.977
while she was away in prison.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.313
Wouldn't be such
a Sister Sledge reunion now,

00:12.346 --> 00:13.214
would it?

00:13.247 --> 00:14.215
The Lyon family

00:14.248 --> 00:15.549
will be performing

00:15.583 --> 00:17.918
at this year's ASA awards.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.889
Me and my son are
not the only people up

00:21.922 --> 00:23.491
for this award.
I'm just saying,

00:23.524 --> 00:25.025
I'm ready to play.
You ready to play?

00:25.059 --> 00:26.994
I was born to play.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.362
The board would
like you to come on

00:28.396 --> 00:30.664
as co-CEOs.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.000
I think it's
a fantastic idea.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.169
I got your back.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.404
Hi, Grandma, it's Andre.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.506
I wish I could have met you.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.740
That woman's name
is Leah Walker.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.008
I believe she's

00:41.041 --> 00:42.376
your grandmother.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.256
N-43.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.194
It's right there.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.062
She has a system...

01:02.096 --> 01:04.064
and the system's
called cheating.

01:04.098 --> 01:07.034
Well, I haven't noticed
her cheating, so...

01:07.067 --> 01:08.769
it's okay.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.971
I-27.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.442
They treat you okay here?

01:14.475 --> 01:15.876
Not Mondays.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.111
I hate meat loaf.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.413
She means Meatloaf Mondays,

01:19.447 --> 01:21.415
which are delicious.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.251
Thank you.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.918
I-29.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.757
So, how about your family?

01:29.790 --> 01:32.760
Does your family
come visit you?

01:32.793 --> 01:34.295
B-7.
MAN: Oh!

01:34.328 --> 01:36.664
Oh... bingo!

01:37.765 --> 01:39.533
(grunts)

01:42.303 --> 01:44.238
That round was for
the watercolor set.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.307
Check his card!

01:52.313 --> 01:54.815
The boy's famous now.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.018
The boy.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.089
Is the boy your son?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.991
I had the voice,

02:04.024 --> 02:06.460
but they never gave me a chance.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.031
They didn't want me to.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.506
Your eyes.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.012
Are you kin to me?

02:30.518 --> 02:32.986
*

02:36.990 --> 02:40.628
* Everybody wants to shine

02:40.661 --> 02:42.330
* But they can keep on wishin'

02:42.363 --> 02:45.333
* 'Cause ain't no stars made

02:45.366 --> 02:46.800
* Overnight

02:46.834 --> 02:48.636
* And ain't no competition

02:48.669 --> 02:50.037
* Out here

02:50.070 --> 02:51.472
* Petition
out here *

02:51.505 --> 02:52.873
* Petition out here

02:52.906 --> 02:54.875
* Ain't no competition

02:54.908 --> 02:57.711
* Out here, petition out here

02:57.745 --> 02:59.146
* Petition out here
* Hey, hey, hey *

02:59.179 --> 03:00.981
* I don't see no competition
* Oh  *

03:01.014 --> 03:02.683
* Where they at?
Where they at? *

03:02.716 --> 03:04.218
* I don't see no one

03:04.252 --> 03:05.853
* I'm Ray Charles,
I'm Stevie Wonder *

03:05.886 --> 03:07.388
* With a blindfold on

03:07.421 --> 03:08.989
* It's gettin' darker
than a bitch out here *

03:09.022 --> 03:10.391
* Hard as hell to get
a pitch out here *

03:10.424 --> 03:11.725
* Throwing money like
I'm rich out here *

03:11.759 --> 03:13.661
* Drinkin' liquor like
a fish out here *

03:13.694 --> 03:15.162
* Mama, I wanna be famous

03:15.195 --> 03:16.497
* Let 'em all know
what my name is *

03:16.530 --> 03:18.165
* I gotta make
some arrangements *

03:18.198 --> 03:19.833
* Money come,
go and it changes *

03:19.867 --> 03:21.168
* Just to be
wearin' the latest *

03:21.201 --> 03:22.836
* I pray every day
like a Christian *

03:22.870 --> 03:24.505
* Mama and Daddy
and all of my family *

03:24.538 --> 03:25.839
* I don't see no competition

03:25.873 --> 03:26.907
* No...

03:26.940 --> 03:29.343
Yes, bitch!

03:29.377 --> 03:31.345
Come through, falsetto!

03:31.379 --> 03:32.546
Yo, y'all come out here.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.216
Becky, it was good?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.885
Keem, I'm living for it.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.687
It's a dope song, right?
It's dope!

03:39.720 --> 03:41.255
Now, look, all I got
to get is this song

03:41.289 --> 03:42.390
on the Ryan Coogler movie

03:42.423 --> 03:43.924
and it instantly
gets me famous.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.759
I can't believe that
this came about from Ryan

03:45.793 --> 03:46.860
hearing your
stripper joint.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.228
Worked for Lil Jon, didn't it?

03:48.262 --> 03:50.431
True.
(laughs)
That's exactly what

03:50.464 --> 03:51.765
he's looking for, too.

03:51.799 --> 03:52.933
Although he is
a little worried about

03:52.966 --> 03:54.234
who's gonna sing the girl part.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.636
I was thinking Tiana.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.440
JAMAL (whispering):
Tiana?

03:59.473 --> 04:00.574
Yeah... Tiana could work

04:00.608 --> 04:01.942
'cause she's real hot

04:01.975 --> 04:04.044
off of her tour, but...

04:04.077 --> 04:05.546
But what?

04:05.579 --> 04:06.547
You don't think Laura

04:06.580 --> 04:07.581
would have a problem with that?

04:08.782 --> 04:10.217
Nah, you overthinking it.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.885
It's just business.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.886
Laura totally gets it.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.922
She gets it.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.957
COOKIE:
So, we're gonna trace the

04:16.990 --> 04:19.427
Lyon family sound from
Lucious in the early Philly days

04:19.460 --> 04:21.261
to Jamal's new album,
but I need

04:21.295 --> 04:22.796
seven minutes of stage time,
not four.

04:22.830 --> 04:23.797
Seven minutes?

04:23.831 --> 04:25.633
Yeah.
You pushing it, Cookie.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.900
Oh, that's what I do.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.268
LUCIOUS:
No.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.604
(laughs)

04:30.638 --> 04:32.239
Mr. D-Major.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.407
Oh, the god

04:33.441 --> 04:35.409
of the ASAs, himself.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.244
Oh, what's good, B?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.646
I'm so proud of you.

04:38.679 --> 04:39.747
I knew you had it.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.615
I got something.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.918
You talking about Lucious
Lyon, classic monster?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.253
This is what we're gonna do
for the ASAs.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.755
Well, actually,

04:47.788 --> 04:49.089
I was thinking we base
the Lyon Family Anthem

04:49.122 --> 04:50.290
off of one of Jamal's.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.926
He is Empire's most
nominated artist.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.928
COOKIE:
And that is a dope idea,

04:54.962 --> 04:58.332
because I can produce a remix
to the song and I can add

04:58.366 --> 05:00.501
a verse for you,
and then one for Hakeem...
Wait, wait, wait, wait,

05:00.534 --> 05:01.935
you're gonna have to slow
your flaps on that.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.971
Look, I run the music
on this thing.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.272
Hey!
We gonna...

05:05.305 --> 05:07.475
Hi, hi, you forgot, I'm co-CEO.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.343
"Co" as in co-pilot,

05:09.377 --> 05:11.612
and I will call you
if I need a bathroom break.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.447
Oh, what's wrong, Pufnstuf?
Look, I...

05:13.481 --> 05:15.115
You mad 'cause you
been on that cleanse

05:15.148 --> 05:16.650
for a week and you ain't
lost no weight, fat-ass?

05:16.684 --> 05:18.118
Funny.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.688
Would you like to meet
Empire's most nominated

05:20.721 --> 05:21.789
artist?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.323
He's looking at him.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.693
No, he ain't-- we talking
about the present, not the past.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.160
* Uh, my thoughts sickening

05:27.194 --> 05:28.629
* All venom, I'm lost in 'em

05:28.662 --> 05:30.130
* Ready for war

05:30.163 --> 05:31.865
* Better pray that
the Lord with him... *

05:31.899 --> 05:33.867
Shouldn't your face be
up there, too, Cookie?

05:33.901 --> 05:34.968
It'd be obsolete

05:35.002 --> 05:36.470
before they
ever finished it.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.871
Hating ass.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.139
Oh, Jamal, come here, baby!

05:39.172 --> 05:41.208
Hey, Ma.
You know D-Major,

05:41.241 --> 05:43.143
musical director
for the ASAs.
Of course.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.645
Congrats, man.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.679
I'm super stoked that
you're doing the ASAs.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.214
Well, I'm stoked
about the remix.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.716
I wasn't a big fan
of the single,

05:48.749 --> 05:50.384
but it's perfect for
the Lyon Family Anthem.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.719
Okay...

05:51.752 --> 05:53.487
I'm not sure what
we're talking about.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.488
I'm doing one of my new songs.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.156
Oh, no...

05:56.189 --> 05:57.858
your mama traded in your solo.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.327
It's gonna be huge, Jamal.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.862
The whole family
on the stage...

06:01.895 --> 06:03.030
Mama, no, I...

06:04.698 --> 06:07.367
I-I can't trade in my solo.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.670
Dude, this is the ASAs.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.339
It's the biggest
stage in the world.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.441
Now, if you want to be on it,

06:13.474 --> 06:14.575
I wouldn't be throwing
some hissy fit.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.417
Porsha, hold up.
Here.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.685
You think I got
time to read?

06:24.718 --> 06:25.853
This is the Bible.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.721
It's been handed down
from assistant to assistant

06:27.755 --> 06:29.022
since the-- will you take it?

06:29.056 --> 06:30.357
God.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.225
It tells you what to do,
what not to do,

06:32.259 --> 06:34.194
who to call...
Cookie got a promotion.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.696
That means you got
a promotion now, too,

06:35.729 --> 06:37.364
so... read it
cover to cover.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.532
Thank you.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.367
No, don't-don't thank me.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.869
You work for a CEO now,

06:41.902 --> 06:43.370
so it's time
to step your game up.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.706
MAN:
This is the stage
layout right here.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.541
(mouths)

06:47.575 --> 06:48.709
Check on those...

06:48.742 --> 06:50.444
Hey, Hakeem.
Hakeem!

06:50.478 --> 06:51.545
(whoops)
Yeah.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.714
Got a verse for me?
Mom,

06:53.747 --> 06:55.783
I'm not singing backup
for Lucious at the ASAs.

06:55.816 --> 06:56.950
I got my own thing
I'm working on.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.252
Boy, it's not backup...

06:59.286 --> 07:02.222
and you can chew gum and walk
at the same time, can't you?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.423
Look...

07:03.457 --> 07:05.726
rehearsal at Laviticus,
don't be late.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.727
All right.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.761
Yeah, all right.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.097
CANDACE:
Nice place, Loretha.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.602
What'd I tell you about calling
me by my government name?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.269
Look, whatever it
is you came for,

07:16.303 --> 07:18.405
Candace, we ain't got time.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.740
Hey, is something wrong
with my kids?

07:19.773 --> 07:20.741
Yes.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.075
They're not with their mother,

07:22.109 --> 07:23.076
and it's time they should be.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.077
Look, Candace, please

07:24.111 --> 07:25.412
don't start all of that.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.947
You know she just
got out of rehab.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.315
She needs to focus.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.449
Just because you weren't

07:29.483 --> 07:30.818
around to raise your kids

07:30.851 --> 07:31.819
doesn't mean
we're gonna follow

07:31.852 --> 07:33.987
your example, Cookie.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.090
When the winter break is over,

07:37.124 --> 07:38.091
the kids are coming here.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.627
Hey, wait a minute.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.962
You know I only have
a two-bedroom apartment.
Oh...

07:41.995 --> 07:44.632
then I suggest you invest
in some bunk beds.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.601
I'm serious, Carol.

07:47.635 --> 07:50.270
You know what...

07:50.303 --> 07:51.471
you need to talk
to your sister

07:51.505 --> 07:52.973
before I kick her ass.

07:53.006 --> 07:53.974
Candace.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.342
Candace!

07:55.375 --> 07:56.610
D-MAJOR:
It's weak.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.111
Now speak your truth.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.048
* My last night...
* Yeah

08:01.081 --> 08:02.783
* If I take one more shot
of this agave, I'll be gone *

08:02.816 --> 08:03.784
JAMAL:
D...

08:03.817 --> 08:04.985
* I'll be lit *

08:05.018 --> 08:06.987
Come on, man, seriously,
listen to this.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.456
Come on, now, I got
seven damn nominations.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.791
I'm just trying
to do one new song.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.125
It's fire, but I'm on

08:12.159 --> 08:13.293
the Lyon Family Anthem tip.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.628
* For the win, I know...

08:14.662 --> 08:16.129
But I'm tired of singing
songs from the past.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.130
This is new stuff.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.198
Son...

08:18.231 --> 08:19.800
there's ways to change my mind,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.002
but ambushing me in the
middle of my session is not it.

08:23.571 --> 08:24.538
Excuse me.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.973
Look, man, if it was not for me,

08:26.006 --> 08:27.474
there would be
no Lyon Anthem,

08:27.507 --> 08:28.542
so I suggest
you talk to me.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.477
You need not
to grab me, dude.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.680
Everybody out.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.883
Now!

08:38.919 --> 08:41.589
Wink, shut the door.
Yeah, man.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.827
Look, all I'm saying is that...

08:46.860 --> 08:48.495
Yeah, man, I get it,
you're a visionary artist,

08:48.528 --> 08:50.163
but I got a hundred artists
that I have to juggle,

08:50.197 --> 08:51.398
plus produce the show,

08:51.431 --> 08:52.499
so if you're not happy,
I suggest you go

08:52.532 --> 08:53.901
talk to your mother.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.368
I'm not talking to my mother,
I'm talking to you.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.342
What...

09:02.375 --> 09:04.244
Yeah.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.346
Been wanting to do that
ever since I seen you

09:06.379 --> 09:07.715
in the lobby this morning,

09:07.748 --> 09:09.549
and then you come
into my meeting,

09:09.583 --> 09:11.518
take it over.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.554
You go for what
you want, and so do I.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.356
* Everybody

09:16.389 --> 09:18.425
* Wants to shine

09:18.458 --> 09:20.360
* But they can keep on

09:20.393 --> 09:21.929
* Wishing 'cause ain't no

09:21.962 --> 09:23.396
* Stars made

09:23.430 --> 09:24.598
* Overnight

09:24.632 --> 09:25.733
* And ain't no

09:25.766 --> 09:28.201
* Competition out here

09:28.235 --> 09:29.436
* Petition
out here *

09:29.469 --> 09:30.570
* Petition out here

09:30.604 --> 09:31.772
* Ain't no

09:31.805 --> 09:33.874
* Competition

09:33.907 --> 09:35.743
* Petition out here

09:35.776 --> 09:37.210
* Petition
out here *

09:37.244 --> 09:39.046
* I don't see no competition

09:39.079 --> 09:41.048
* Where they at?
Where they at? *

09:41.081 --> 09:42.215
* I don't see no one

09:42.249 --> 09:43.283
* I'm Ray Charles
* Oh *

09:43.316 --> 09:44.584
* I'm Stevie Wonder

09:44.618 --> 09:45.886
* With a blindfold on,
it's gettin' darker *

09:45.919 --> 09:47.220
* Than a bitch out here

09:47.254 --> 09:48.756
* Hard as hell to get
a pitch out here *

09:48.789 --> 09:50.057
* Throwing money like
I'm rich out here *

09:50.090 --> 09:51.591
* Drinkin' liquor
like a fish out here *

09:51.625 --> 09:53.293
* Mama, I wanna be famous

09:53.326 --> 09:54.728
* Let 'em all know
what my name is *

09:54.762 --> 09:56.263
* I got to make
some arrangements *

09:56.296 --> 09:58.231
* Money come,
go and it changes *

09:58.265 --> 09:59.266
* Just to be
wearin' the latest *

09:59.299 --> 10:01.068
* I pray every day
like a Christian *

10:01.101 --> 10:02.602
* Mama and Daddy
and all of my family *

10:02.636 --> 10:03.771
* I don't see no competition

10:03.804 --> 10:04.738
* No

10:04.772 --> 10:06.106
* Everybody

10:06.139 --> 10:07.574
* Wants to shine

10:07.607 --> 10:09.276
JAMAL:
* Whoa, no, whoa, no *

10:09.309 --> 10:11.411
TIANA:
* But they can keep on wishing

10:11.444 --> 10:13.080
* 'Cause ain't no stars made

10:13.113 --> 10:15.115
* Overnight
* Oh, no, oh, no *

10:15.148 --> 10:17.150
* And ain't no competition

10:17.184 --> 10:18.919
* Out here, petition out here

10:18.952 --> 10:20.754
* Petition out here

10:20.788 --> 10:23.824
* Ain't no competition

10:23.857 --> 10:25.092

10:25.125 --> 10:27.094
* Petition
out here *

10:27.127 --> 10:28.161
* I don't see no

10:28.195 --> 10:29.462
* Competition.

10:29.496 --> 10:30.664
You know what I mean?

10:30.698 --> 10:31.932
I can't see Ryan Coogler
not putting this

10:31.965 --> 10:32.933
on the soundtrack.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.334
Soundtrack?

10:34.367 --> 10:36.136
I definitely want that
on my next album.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.638
It's 1:00?

10:38.672 --> 10:40.774
I thought it was 10:00.

10:40.808 --> 10:41.942
Laura gonna kill me.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.610
Wow... the Hakeem

10:43.643 --> 10:45.813
I knew would want to
go to the club

10:45.846 --> 10:47.347
right now...

10:47.380 --> 10:48.782
but I guess you can't, huh?

10:48.816 --> 10:50.283
Since you got a wifey...

10:50.317 --> 10:51.885
and a baby mama.

10:51.919 --> 10:52.786
What, you got jokes?

10:52.820 --> 10:54.988
(laughing): I'm just...

10:55.022 --> 10:57.490
Look, I can go to
the club if I want,

10:57.524 --> 10:59.793
but Cookie got me focusing
on this ASA thing, so...

10:59.827 --> 11:02.395
Well, we're definitely
gonna miss you.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.546
COOKIE:
Okay, I need you to put that on
table 7, those go on table...

11:19.579 --> 11:21.681
You know, according
to the Empire HR bible,

11:21.715 --> 11:23.183
setting out tables and stuff

11:23.216 --> 11:24.551
is not the job
of the CEO assistants.

11:24.584 --> 11:25.819
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.154
Would you like a demotion?

11:27.187 --> 11:28.856
I can arrange that.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.057
I'll do it today.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.058
Yeah, I know you will.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.726
Sure.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.395
Rough night?

11:35.428 --> 11:36.764
Yeah.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.899
But I ain't
complaining, fool.

11:38.932 --> 11:39.900
(chuckles)

11:39.933 --> 11:42.069
Gots to love it.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.536
I don't know who
ordered all this stuff,

11:43.570 --> 11:45.338
but I want it all
86ed out of here.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.174
Yo, what's that green mess,
anyway?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.743
Dad's on a fast for the ASAs,

11:49.777 --> 11:52.345
'cause Mom let him know that
TV puts ten pounds on you.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.514
No, he's doing it
for his health.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.750
Um, so I got a rough script.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.019
Andre's gonna start
with some narration

11:59.052 --> 12:00.220
to set up the scene;

12:00.253 --> 12:01.688
he should be here
in a minute.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.590
(Lucious playing piano)

12:05.959 --> 12:08.395
Dad, that's not it.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.530
You don't think that sounds
played out? It honestly

12:10.563 --> 12:11.698
sounds like you're
trying to make my song

12:11.731 --> 12:12.732
sound like your old song.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.067
Well, if it sounds played out,

12:14.101 --> 12:15.735
it means you wrote
a played out song.

12:15.769 --> 12:16.937
I wrote a played out song?

12:16.970 --> 12:18.405
I'm trying to fix...
No, you don't want
to change it

12:18.438 --> 12:19.606
and you sound...
Listen, I'm not down

12:19.639 --> 12:20.874
with all of this R & B
back and forth.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.109
Mom, where's my verse
supposed to be?

12:22.142 --> 12:23.110
Okay, pause.
I'm supposed to
sing on the bridge?

12:23.143 --> 12:24.211
Pause!

12:24.244 --> 12:25.378
I'm running this.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.080
I got this, and of course

12:27.114 --> 12:28.715
we're gonna find somewhere
for your verse, Hakeem...

12:28.748 --> 12:30.217
and Lucious,
your verse can be

12:30.250 --> 12:31.618
a flip on Jamal's,
and Jamal, it's your song.

12:31.651 --> 12:33.053
JAMAL:
Thank you, Mom,
thank you.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.054
See, it's my song.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.422
You know what?
This ain't working.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.424
I want to go back
to my original plan.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.059
JAMAL:
What original plan, Dad?
Where we do the song

12:39.092 --> 12:40.060
where you accuse us
of biting the hand

12:40.093 --> 12:41.461
that never really fed us?

12:41.494 --> 12:42.796
Oh, you didn't eat?
Nah, he talking
about the song

12:42.830 --> 12:43.931
that he wrote back when
(Cookie sighing)

12:43.964 --> 12:44.932
he thought Mom
was snitch bitch.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.266
(discordant piano note)

12:46.299 --> 12:48.936
Now, y'all sound like
a rack of bitches, okay?

12:48.969 --> 12:49.937
Lucious can sit up here

12:49.970 --> 12:51.304
and take y'all's
jaw jacking,

12:51.338 --> 12:53.140
but I'm not 'cause
I'm running this show.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.942
Excuse me?
Yeah, excuse me.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.910
I busted my ass
to finally get here

12:56.944 --> 12:58.912
and I'll be damned if
I let y'all mess it up.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.413
So put your big
girl drawers on,

13:00.447 --> 13:01.648
'cause we gonna
come together

13:01.681 --> 13:03.116
and do this as a family.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.584
Does anybody here
know what that means?

13:04.617 --> 13:05.819
ANDRE:
That's an
intriguing question...

13:07.988 --> 13:10.690
and I have someone here with me
that might have a point of view.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.427
It's okay, Grandma.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.463
This is your family.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.173
COOKIE:
Lucious...

13:26.206 --> 13:28.308
JAMAL:
Whose grandmother?

13:28.341 --> 13:29.977
What do you mean Grandma?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.447
Who is this lady?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.549
Lucious.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.155
Dwight?

13:44.357 --> 13:46.793
Andre, what's going on?

13:46.826 --> 13:49.196
This is Leah Walker...

13:49.229 --> 13:50.497
Lucious' mother.

13:51.731 --> 13:54.167
Andre,
our grandmother's dead.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.005
(sighs)

13:58.038 --> 14:00.407
ANDRE:
What, you got
nothing to say?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.377
You want to tell
them about how you...

14:04.411 --> 14:05.712
sent her away to a home

14:05.745 --> 14:08.381
for 21 years,
never looked back?

14:08.415 --> 14:10.717
Or how about how you

14:10.750 --> 14:13.653
sent Vernon out there once
a month to pay out hush money

14:13.686 --> 14:14.821
to anybody who knew
who she really was--

14:14.854 --> 14:16.489
how about that one, huh?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.824
Dad, what?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.392
Yeah, that's not true.
It's not.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.095
No, Harper Scott gave me
her files.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.668
Can't lie your way out
of this one, Pop.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.538
(crying)

14:35.608 --> 14:38.045
You have no...

14:38.078 --> 14:39.546
idea what you've done.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.890
I can't believe
that just happened.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.360
Yeah, it's deeper
than we think, too.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.095
You see the look
on his face?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.729
D-MAJOR:
What's good, Lyon brothers?

14:56.763 --> 14:58.565
(phone beeping)
Here to check out
your rehearsal.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.200
Hey, yo, Laura
blowing me up.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.201
Meet you up, bro.
All right.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.202
Baby...

15:02.235 --> 15:03.403
Yo.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.737
Yo, you might not
want to go back there;

15:04.771 --> 15:06.406
Lucious and Cookie
are trying to figure

15:06.439 --> 15:07.774
some things out.
Yeah, well,
maybe I can help.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.376
No, no, it's family stuff.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.777
Besides, you really expect me
to believe that you

15:10.810 --> 15:11.878
only came for rehearsal?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.213
Yeah, that's my job,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.647
but if I'm not needed,
then I'm out.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.228
COOKIE:
Lucious...

15:28.261 --> 15:30.097
Yeah, baby?

15:30.130 --> 15:32.732
Why did you lie?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.968
I didn't lie
about anything.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.406
Then what was that video about?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.908
(sighs)

15:41.941 --> 15:44.144
The truth.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.413
My mother did try and drown me.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.983
She did put a gun to her head
and pulled the trigger,

15:50.017 --> 15:52.952
and told an eight-year-old boy
that it was his fault

15:52.986 --> 15:56.323
she was the way she is.

15:56.356 --> 15:59.359
Just turns out there was
no bullets in the gun.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.762
Well, if she didn't die then...

16:02.795 --> 16:04.464
No...

16:04.497 --> 16:08.201
my mother died the day
that they locked her up.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.804
And then remember
how under Reagan...

16:13.473 --> 16:15.308
...the government took all
the mentally ill patients

16:15.342 --> 16:16.776
and dumped them out
on the street?

16:16.809 --> 16:19.946
Well, one day in front
of 30th Street Station,

16:19.979 --> 16:22.349
I damn near
tripped over her.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.983
Now you and me,
we were on welfare

16:24.017 --> 16:25.452
and had two and a half kids,

16:25.485 --> 16:27.854
we couldn't take care of her
if we wanted to.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.159
You just...

16:32.192 --> 16:34.561
you could have at least
told me about her, Lucious.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.165
(whispering):
I couldn't.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.966
I needed her to stay dead.

16:39.999 --> 16:44.871
That's why I took
Andre to the grave.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.540
He just wouldn't leave
it alone, you know.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.810
But he just doesn't understand.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.746
I mean, none of y'all
understand how...

16:53.780 --> 16:55.548
dangerous she really is.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.593
Why didn't you tell me?
How did you
even find out?

17:06.626 --> 17:07.827
What, you were snooping
through my computer?

17:07.860 --> 17:09.196
It doesn't matter
how I found out.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.663
What matters is, Tiana's
doing a duet with you

17:10.697 --> 17:12.165
on a song you yourself
told me would go platinum.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.166
The producers wanted her.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.033
It was out of my control, babe.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.335
You could have pushed for me.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.769
I bet you never even
brought me up.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.706
Baby...

17:19.739 --> 17:21.007
I love you.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.342
Okay? You know that.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.710
But you can't
automatically think

17:23.743 --> 17:25.178
you're gonna be
on all my duets.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.215
Trust me, there'll be
other opportunities.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.218
I trust you.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.852
I just don't trust Tiana.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.354
She's still feeling you.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.022
So what if she is?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.390
I want you.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.826
*

17:51.938 --> 17:53.706
ANDRE:
I don't trust him, okay?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.442
I think she needs to stay
with us until we find

17:55.475 --> 17:56.443
a permanent situation.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.877
No, Andre,
we're staying in a hotel.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.447
We can get her an
adjoining room, babe.
Oh...

18:00.480 --> 18:02.215
I think we should at least
talk to her caregivers.

18:02.249 --> 18:05.385
I mean, do you even know
who her doctors are?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.719
Great.

18:06.753 --> 18:07.887
(sighs)

18:07.920 --> 18:09.889
RHONDA:
This will be fun.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.058
Come on, Granny Groove.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.926
ANDRE:
What the hell?

18:13.960 --> 18:16.263
THIRSTY:
Whoopsy daisy.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.565
Hey!

18:18.598 --> 18:20.400
Where the hell you think
you're going, man?
LUCIOUS:
Hey, Andre.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.068
No, where you going?
Andre!

18:22.101 --> 18:23.236
Andre, fall back.
Fall back?!

18:23.270 --> 18:24.437
What you talking...
I don't know what

18:24.471 --> 18:26.473
you think you're gonna
get out of this, but that's not

18:26.506 --> 18:27.807
what you want
right now.
You're the one who hid her

18:27.840 --> 18:29.075
from everybody, you did that.
I didn't hide her.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.410
You think she's like you.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.279
She's a completely
different kind of person.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.646
Andre...

18:33.680 --> 18:34.981
she needs to be back
at the home, baby.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.583
You don't know how miserable
she was in that home, Ma.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.750
COOKIE:
She needs to be
with professionals.

18:37.784 --> 18:38.585
You don't know,
you don't know about it.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.586
Grandma, listen...

18:39.619 --> 18:41.421
I got your medicine

18:41.454 --> 18:42.455
and your suitcase with all
your things, all right?

18:42.489 --> 18:43.923
I got plenty of room for you.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.925
ANDRE: We're gonna
go home, okay?
COOKIE: Andre...

18:45.958 --> 18:47.760
I want to go home...
Yeah, we're going home,
we're going home.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.197
...with my Dwight.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.953
Dwight...

19:13.986 --> 19:15.822
I want to go
to bed now.

19:15.855 --> 19:19.359
I'll have the nurse
take you to your room.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.873
Juanita.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.242
Yes, sir.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.979
I want you to make sure

19:40.012 --> 19:42.014
she takes each and
every one of her pills.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.850
Watch her put them
in her mouth.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.818
Check to make sure
she swallowed them.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.487
Remove the phone
out of her room,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.522
and nobody comes to see her
without my permission.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.492
And no matter what, you don't
take your eyes off of her, okay?

19:52.525 --> 19:53.893
Yes, sir.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.503
* I came for blood

20:03.536 --> 20:04.837
* Your days are done

20:04.871 --> 20:06.839
* I came to win,
you came to run... *

20:06.873 --> 20:08.007
I thought we were
going to Lucious'?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.342
You said he wanted
to make a statement.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.244
Can I ask you
something, Ms. Scott?

20:11.278 --> 20:12.379
Why did you become
a journalist?

20:13.380 --> 20:15.348
Because I believe
in the truth.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.084
Hmm, see, that's why
I became an attorney.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.553
The truth is nowhere
near as important

20:20.587 --> 20:22.021
as what you can persuade
people to believe.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.723
THIRSTY:
Case in point...

20:24.791 --> 20:26.092
Do you believe
running your mouth

20:26.125 --> 20:27.427
about Leah Walker
can get you hurt?

20:27.460 --> 20:29.195
Lucious should know that

20:29.228 --> 20:30.763
I can't be threatened or bought.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.165
Mm-hmm.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.605
That's what he thought.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.873
What are you gonna do?

20:40.907 --> 20:43.376
Kill me and leave me
by the side of the road?

20:43.410 --> 20:46.045
I resent that-- I'm a gentleman.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.614
I wouldn't touch
a hair on your head.

20:47.647 --> 20:50.417
* Something's coming alive now
(unlocks)

20:50.450 --> 20:51.551
Bye-bye.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.554
* All the fears just died out

20:54.587 --> 20:55.722
* Now I'm comin' to conquer

20:55.755 --> 20:57.256
* You've awakened a monster

20:57.290 --> 20:59.426
Thanks, Thirsty, appreciate...
* I can feel it inside now

20:59.459 --> 21:01.260
(screaming)
* I came for blood

21:01.294 --> 21:02.795
* Your days are done,
I came to win *

21:02.829 --> 21:03.963
(muffled screaming)
* You came to run

21:03.996 --> 21:05.231
(tires screeching)
* It's all or nothing

21:05.264 --> 21:07.300
* I paid enough,
I've waited up *

21:07.334 --> 21:08.801
* I may erupt,
my way or none *

21:08.835 --> 21:09.936
* It's all or nothing.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.180
Hey, J.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.916
This ain't necessary.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.353
I got the message
loud and clear, so...

21:28.120 --> 21:30.156
What about this message?

21:30.189 --> 21:32.291
Come on, man,
stop playing with me.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.928
I thought you
ain't feeling me.

21:35.962 --> 21:36.996
I'm feeling you.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.465
Why would I not
be feeling you?

21:38.498 --> 21:40.467
Hmm?
'Cause you blew me off
like it was nothing.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.834
We were in a work situation.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.135
I try to keep things
professional, man.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.306
And because you're not out.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.541
Hmm?

21:50.343 --> 21:51.344
I don't think

21:51.378 --> 21:52.845
it's anybody's
business, man.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.280
But it is when you're in
a club with a hot girl,

21:54.313 --> 21:55.515
then it's all of the
paparazzi's business.

21:55.548 --> 21:56.649
Look, you're making
a big deal out of this.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.850
It is a big deal...

21:57.884 --> 21:59.185
to me, it's important.

21:59.218 --> 22:00.620
You know, I worked damn hard

22:00.653 --> 22:01.821
to walk in my truth.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.291
That's why I thought
you would understand

22:05.324 --> 22:07.026
where I'm coming from, man.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.696
It's hard, man.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.297
You know that thing you did
with Skye Summers,

22:11.330 --> 22:12.331
man, I thought
that was so cool...

22:12.365 --> 22:13.633
Derek, that was
completely different.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.134
Yo, man, you should understand
where I'm coming from.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.202
Listen to me, man.
No, stop!

22:16.235 --> 22:18.471
Stop.

22:18.505 --> 22:23.309
Now, I like you
a lot, I do...

22:23.342 --> 22:26.245
but this whole thing...

22:26.278 --> 22:27.480
it's not for me,

22:27.514 --> 22:29.516
so, please...

22:42.028 --> 22:44.397
(jazz playing)

22:53.740 --> 22:55.675
I don't think that whiskey

22:55.708 --> 22:58.377
is a part of your
juicing cleanse.

23:02.549 --> 23:05.518
What are you
afraid of, huh?

23:05.552 --> 23:07.186
She's just a...

23:07.219 --> 23:10.757
feeble, fragile,
little old lady.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.859
So that's what you think, huh?

23:12.892 --> 23:15.261
That's what she wants
everybody to think.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.395
Hmm...

23:20.900 --> 23:22.569
You're afraid...

23:22.602 --> 23:25.371
that if this gets out,
it'll be a scandal.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.406
Yeah, you're afraid you're
gonna lose all that love

23:27.440 --> 23:29.041
you got for "Boom
Boom Boom Boom."

23:29.075 --> 23:32.044
Trust me, this gets out,
it's not good for nobody.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.213
It ain't gonna
get out, Lucious.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.049
Just as long as you do
right by your sons.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.285
So that's what this is about?

23:39.318 --> 23:41.087
Damn ASA performance?

23:41.120 --> 23:43.456
You trying to get me
to do the song

23:43.490 --> 23:44.791
Jamal's way, huh?

23:44.824 --> 23:47.159
This is not about
the ASAs, stupid.

23:47.193 --> 23:50.429
This is about you.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.565
You sitting up here,
acting like you still

23:52.599 --> 23:53.800
in those Philly projects,

23:53.833 --> 23:54.901
when you the king.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.068
You the king
of the world,

23:56.102 --> 23:58.638
and there is
nothing to fear.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.741
Especially not
from your own mama.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.410
Get yourself together.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.514
I'm the one that should
be drinking around here.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.254
CAROL:
Thank you for coming, Candace.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.623
You're welcome.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.424
Uh, Candace, listen,
I really need for you

24:18.457 --> 24:20.927
to keep my kids just
a little while longer.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.162
They need their mother.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.597
Well, you know, I'm about
to get my 90-day chip and...

24:24.631 --> 24:25.798
And?

24:25.832 --> 24:27.600
I just need a little more time

24:27.634 --> 24:29.435
to make things right
with everyone.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.804
What do you mean by that?

24:31.838 --> 24:35.141
I want to tell Cookie...

24:35.174 --> 24:36.442
about what Lucious and I did...

24:36.475 --> 24:37.443
Hell to the no!

24:37.476 --> 24:38.811
No, but come on, I'm not

24:38.845 --> 24:40.613
like y'all;
I can't live with secrets.

24:40.647 --> 24:41.948
It's not a secret.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.616
It's an atomic bomb.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.151
What you gonna say, huh?

24:45.184 --> 24:46.152
"Cookie...

24:46.185 --> 24:47.153
"here's your morning papers,

24:47.186 --> 24:48.454
"and by the way,

24:48.487 --> 24:50.623
"I helped Lucious
murder a few people

24:50.657 --> 24:51.958
while you were locked up"?
Wait a second.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.292
I promised Cookie I would help

24:53.325 --> 24:54.961
Lucious stay out of trouble.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.963
Well...
All right, he made me
his line-up girl.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.298
I did not do anything
to hurt anybody...

24:59.331 --> 25:00.967
but it...

25:01.000 --> 25:02.501
it is weighing on me,

25:02.535 --> 25:04.671
and I got to
get this off me.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.138
You need to suck it up,

25:06.172 --> 25:09.141
'cause the last thing
we need is Hurricane Cookie

25:09.175 --> 25:11.477
going Category Five
on our asses.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.080
Oh, no... mm-mm.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.548
Food...

25:15.582 --> 25:18.017
Thank you.
(chuckles)

25:22.188 --> 25:24.891
Yo, Anika, where do you
want us to put this?

25:24.924 --> 25:26.158
You guys can put it
right over there.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.393
Thank you.

25:27.426 --> 25:28.527
Whoa!

25:28.561 --> 25:30.529
(laughs)
I can't believe this.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.732
Hakeem's really
serious, huh?
I know.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.400
He even baby-proofed
the Jacuzzi.

25:34.433 --> 25:36.068
(laughing):
I know, I know, right?

25:36.102 --> 25:37.403
I am impressed.

25:37.436 --> 25:40.072
Rhonda, thank you.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.173
Thank you for all this

25:41.207 --> 25:43.009
amazing stuff and...

25:43.042 --> 25:44.243
you and Andre,
y-you're so generous.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.178
Honestly, you did not
have to do this.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.847
It's nothing, really.
I feel like...

25:47.880 --> 25:49.682
if...

25:49.716 --> 25:51.718
when we try again, I...

25:51.751 --> 25:53.686
I just...

25:53.720 --> 25:55.688
want a fresh start. I don't
want to be reminded...

25:55.722 --> 25:56.723
Watch out!
Oh, my God!

25:56.756 --> 25:57.924
(gasps)

26:01.894 --> 26:03.095
Are you okay?

26:03.129 --> 26:04.196
MAN:
I am so sorry.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.065
Hell!
Are you all right?

26:06.098 --> 26:07.700
Yeah.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.035
That was so weird.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.569
I didn't mean to...

26:10.603 --> 26:11.771
What's wrong?

26:11.804 --> 26:13.405
I just...

26:13.439 --> 26:14.741
I don't know,
I felt like I was

26:14.774 --> 26:16.909
at the top of my stairs and...

26:16.943 --> 26:19.612
and felt hands on my back...

26:19.646 --> 26:21.580
and-and I went crashing
down the stairs.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.382
Wait, wait,
hold on, hold on...

26:23.415 --> 26:25.051
(hyperventilating)

26:25.084 --> 26:27.053
Are you saying that you think
that someone pushed you?

26:27.086 --> 26:28.921
I really don't know.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.790
Oh, my God, I-I-I thought
you said you fell.

26:30.823 --> 26:31.791
I thought it was
an accident.

26:31.824 --> 26:34.560
(heavy breathing)

26:34.593 --> 26:37.797
I thought I did, too.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.066
(calm piano playing)

26:40.099 --> 26:43.836
(humming)

26:48.174 --> 26:52.912
* Where do I go

26:52.945 --> 26:55.948
* When I can't go

26:55.982 --> 27:00.787
* Home...?

27:05.157 --> 27:07.927
Do you remember that song,
Dwight?

27:07.960 --> 27:10.096
My name is Lucious.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.832
Lucious.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.705
Yeah, I remember it.

27:22.809 --> 27:26.478
(chuckles)

27:26.512 --> 27:28.280
(clears throat)

27:28.314 --> 27:30.683
(piano playing)

27:34.653 --> 27:37.489
(both humming)

27:44.230 --> 27:47.967
* Where do I go

27:48.000 --> 27:49.668
* Where do I go from here?

27:49.702 --> 27:51.871
* When I can't

27:51.904 --> 27:53.706
* Go home?

27:53.740 --> 27:57.877
* Hmm... hmm... hmm...

27:57.910 --> 28:02.348
* Home

28:02.381 --> 28:04.683
* Where do I go

28:04.717 --> 28:08.354
* From here?

28:14.393 --> 28:17.196
You were always
so good at the piano.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.999
(chuckles)

28:20.032 --> 28:23.803
You told your family
bad things about me.

28:25.071 --> 28:27.139
I was just honest with them.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.542
I was sick.

28:30.576 --> 28:32.378
I'm better now, Dwight.

28:32.411 --> 28:36.048
You believe me, don't you?

28:44.924 --> 28:46.926
My name is Lucious.

29:10.682 --> 29:13.252
(sighs)

29:13.285 --> 29:14.553
Mom, I don't think
he's coming,

29:14.586 --> 29:15.922
so what are we doing?

29:15.955 --> 29:17.256
Uh, well, we need
to tell D-Major

29:17.289 --> 29:18.424
we need a little bit more time?

29:18.457 --> 29:20.793
No, no,
just let me figure it out.

29:20.827 --> 29:22.128
There he is.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.430
Jamal...

29:24.463 --> 29:25.932
I made some changes to the song.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.233
Dad, you can't do that...
HAKEEM: Mom...

29:27.266 --> 29:28.234
LUCIOUS:
Hear me out.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.368
I told y'all how
this is going down.

29:30.636 --> 29:33.005
(piano playing)

29:39.178 --> 29:41.613
What's that?

29:43.349 --> 29:45.284
Something my mama gave me.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.320
It's actually pretty.

29:50.022 --> 29:52.591
This is where your
okeydoke verse is gonna go.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.093
You got to be 100% honest,

29:54.126 --> 29:55.461
the way we really
are with each other.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.595
Honest?

29:56.628 --> 29:58.264
That's what you
really want?

29:58.297 --> 30:00.132
Unless you're scared.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.470
Here we go.

30:04.503 --> 30:07.339
* Blood is supposed to be
thicker than water is *

30:07.373 --> 30:10.442
* Nowadays we can't even
stomach the thought of it *

30:10.476 --> 30:12.444
* It's like we can't
even get along *

30:12.478 --> 30:13.779
* Who right
and who in the wrong? *

30:13.812 --> 30:15.447
* Too busy pointin' fingers

30:15.481 --> 30:16.949
* Like it's politics,
I tell you *

30:16.983 --> 30:18.484
* Shut up,
you tell me be quiet *

30:18.517 --> 30:19.618
* Too much dysfunction

30:19.651 --> 30:21.453
* Cut up like we at a riot

30:21.487 --> 30:23.189
* Kickin' and punchin'
* Mm, mm *

30:23.222 --> 30:25.624
* Ain't nobody here
to mediate it *
* Mediate it *

30:25.657 --> 30:27.994
* And you would think that
we wasn't even related *

30:28.027 --> 30:29.528
* Oh, oh *
* Why we even throwin' blows

30:29.561 --> 30:31.297
* in the first place?
* Oh *

30:31.330 --> 30:33.532
* We fight at cookouts,
picnics and birthdays *

30:33.565 --> 30:36.002
* I try to give the benefit
* Oh *

30:36.035 --> 30:37.636
* But in the worst case

30:37.669 --> 30:39.805
* You keep on talkin' smack,
you end up with a hurt face *

30:39.838 --> 30:42.141
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *
* And we tried everything

30:42.174 --> 30:43.475
* Now it's time for plan "B"

30:43.509 --> 30:45.144
* If Bloods and Crips
can reconcile *

30:45.177 --> 30:46.478
* Why can't we?
* Why can't we? *

30:46.512 --> 30:47.880
* I guess I'm ratchet
like my mama *

30:47.914 --> 30:49.848
* And my papa,
I'm chasin' the sky *

30:49.882 --> 30:52.184
* And I ain't talkin'
'bout the vodka, let's fly *

30:52.218 --> 30:53.819
* Come on

30:53.852 --> 30:55.321
That is good.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.822
That is so...

30:56.855 --> 30:58.157
good.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.392
(chuckling):
I know it is,
I wrote it.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.694
Look, I know we've, um...

31:04.396 --> 31:06.865
...thrown a lot of blows
at each other over the years,

31:06.899 --> 31:09.835
and because of being Lyons,

31:09.868 --> 31:12.671
we'll probably throw
a whole lot more,

31:12.704 --> 31:16.842
but no matter what happens,
I'm still y'all father...

31:16.875 --> 31:18.544
and you're still my first love.

31:20.746 --> 31:23.415
And y'all are still our kids.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.384
Punk asses.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.652
(Lucious and Cookie chuckle)

31:32.558 --> 31:34.927
("Genghis Khan" by Miike Snow
playing)

31:38.464 --> 31:40.566
Carol?

31:41.600 --> 31:43.970
* I know there's no form

31:44.003 --> 31:45.737
* And no labels to put on

31:45.771 --> 31:46.738
Tariq?

31:46.772 --> 31:47.906
What the hell?

31:47.940 --> 31:49.241
I thought that was you.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.242
I was just in here this morning.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.243
Was that Candace with you?

31:51.277 --> 31:53.079
Yeah, yeah.

31:53.112 --> 31:54.246
What are you doing
in New York?

31:54.280 --> 31:55.747
Well, I live
in New York now.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.749
So, what, you working
for the NYPD or what?

31:57.783 --> 32:00.286
No, I quit the force
a long time ago.

32:00.319 --> 32:01.988
It's hard being
a beat cop these days,

32:02.021 --> 32:03.089
especially in
the old neighborhood.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.923
Yeah, I hear you.

32:04.957 --> 32:06.625
What's that you're drinking?

32:06.658 --> 32:08.927
* To get it on
with nobody else but me *

32:08.961 --> 32:10.762
Wild Turkey on the rocks.

32:10.796 --> 32:12.965
Is something wrong with it?

32:12.999 --> 32:14.633
* I get a little bit
Genghis Khan *

32:14.666 --> 32:15.667
What do you mean?

32:15.701 --> 32:17.269
Ice is all melted.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.171
Looks like you haven't
even touched it.

32:19.205 --> 32:22.508
I guess I was just
waiting to toast.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.611
*

32:25.644 --> 32:27.179
Freshen her up.
Will do.

32:27.213 --> 32:28.447
And I'll have
the same.
Okay.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.815
You know what?

32:29.848 --> 32:31.283
I'll just have
a cranberry juice.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.952
Oh, come on, you gonna
let me drink alone?

32:33.986 --> 32:35.287
The Carol I knew

32:35.321 --> 32:37.289
would have been
on her second drink now.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.625
* And the scene slips away...

32:39.658 --> 32:43.029
Actually, I, um...

32:43.062 --> 32:45.797
I got to get up early
in the morning, that's all.

32:45.831 --> 32:48.034
Put this on my tab.
I got hers.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.302
No, you don't have
to do that, no.

32:50.336 --> 32:51.637
I'm happy to.

32:52.871 --> 32:54.673
To old friends.

32:54.706 --> 32:57.143
(sighs)

32:57.176 --> 33:00.979
To old friends.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.849
ANDRE:
People say you can't
choose your family.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.353
That's not true.

33:07.386 --> 33:10.056
Time and again,
we're confronted with the truth

33:10.089 --> 33:12.358
about what a mess we all are,

33:12.391 --> 33:15.894
and time and again...

33:15.927 --> 33:17.696
we choose one another.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.502
That is family.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.904
We're not perfect...

33:25.937 --> 33:27.439
but we're all we got.

33:31.043 --> 33:35.047
JAMAL:
* Open your eyes

33:35.081 --> 33:38.084
* To what you love to hate

33:38.117 --> 33:40.886
* You're up in the sky,
mm, yeah *

33:40.919 --> 33:42.888
* But you ain't flying

33:42.921 --> 33:44.356
* Straight

33:44.390 --> 33:47.093
* Where do I go

33:47.126 --> 33:48.860
* When I can't go

33:48.894 --> 33:51.563
* Home, 'cause you sold it

33:51.597 --> 33:53.899
* And you lost yourself
and you are *

33:53.932 --> 33:56.102
* Just no more

33:56.135 --> 33:59.037
* Take every piece

33:59.071 --> 34:02.241
* Every piece of me

34:02.274 --> 34:04.710
* Whatever you need

34:04.743 --> 34:08.046
* My mind is changing

34:08.080 --> 34:10.216
* And I can't hide

34:10.249 --> 34:13.452
* But you know where I'll be

34:13.485 --> 34:16.122
* Mother

34:18.924 --> 34:21.059
* And I know

34:21.093 --> 34:23.129
* I said I didn't need it

34:23.162 --> 34:24.596
* I said I wasn't built

34:24.630 --> 34:27.099
* For it

34:27.133 --> 34:29.101
* But now that I can see it

34:29.135 --> 34:30.136
* Damn right, I'm really made

34:30.169 --> 34:33.105
* For this

34:33.139 --> 34:35.807
* Chasing the sky

34:35.841 --> 34:38.910
* Trying to fly

34:38.944 --> 34:40.612
* Trying
to fly *

34:40.646 --> 34:44.416
* And now I see

34:44.450 --> 34:46.818
* Now I see *
* Just why it had

34:46.852 --> 34:51.157
* To be so hard for me

34:51.190 --> 34:52.658
* You'll hear my roar

34:52.691 --> 34:55.794
* They'll feel your legacy

34:55.827 --> 34:58.997
* Fear of the sky

34:59.030 --> 35:01.767
* No choice but to fly

35:01.800 --> 35:04.436
* So high, so high

35:04.470 --> 35:06.938
* So high

35:06.972 --> 35:08.974
* Blood is supposed to be
thicker than water is *

35:09.007 --> 35:11.977
* Nowadays we can't even
stomach the thought of it *

35:12.010 --> 35:14.280
* It's like we can't
even get along *

35:14.313 --> 35:15.681
* Who right
and who in the wrong? *

35:15.714 --> 35:17.316
* Too busy pointin' fingers

35:17.349 --> 35:18.317
* Like it's politics
* Politics *

35:18.350 --> 35:19.318
* I tell you shut up

35:19.351 --> 35:20.619
* You tell me be quiet

35:20.652 --> 35:21.687
* Too much dysfunction

35:21.720 --> 35:23.121
* Cut up like we at a riot

35:23.155 --> 35:24.990
* Kickin' and punchin'
* Mm-hmm *

35:25.023 --> 35:27.659
* Ain't nobody here
to mediate it *
* Mediate it *

35:27.693 --> 35:29.528
* And you would think that
we wasn't even related *

35:29.561 --> 35:30.962
* Oh *
* Why we even

35:30.996 --> 35:32.464
* Throwin' blows
in the first place? *

35:32.498 --> 35:33.965
* Oh *

35:33.999 --> 35:35.667
* We fight at cookouts,
picnics and birthdays *

35:35.701 --> 35:37.636
* I try to give the benefit

35:37.669 --> 35:39.137
* But in the worst case

35:39.171 --> 35:40.306
* You keep on talkin' smack

35:40.339 --> 35:41.873
* You end up with a hurt face

35:41.907 --> 35:43.642
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

35:43.675 --> 35:45.211
* And we tried everything,
now it's time for plan "B" *

35:45.244 --> 35:47.012
* If Bloods and Crips
can reconcile *

35:47.045 --> 35:48.714
* Why can't we?
* Why can't we? *

35:48.747 --> 35:50.549
* I guess I'm ratchet
like my mama and my papa *

35:50.582 --> 35:52.318
* I'm chasing the sky

35:52.351 --> 35:54.353
* And I ain't talkin'
'bout the vodka, let's fly *

35:54.386 --> 35:56.822
* Far from a perfect man

35:56.855 --> 35:58.857
* The fights and the lies

35:58.890 --> 36:01.993
* I guess you'll
never understand *

36:02.027 --> 36:04.330
* A mother

36:04.363 --> 36:07.032
* And father who
wanted for you *

36:07.065 --> 36:09.167
* Much more than
* Much more than *

36:09.201 --> 36:11.002
* Life is a slight of hand

36:11.036 --> 36:12.238
* So you hate it today

36:12.271 --> 36:15.207
* But my love for you

36:15.241 --> 36:17.876
* Is the one thing
that is true *

36:17.909 --> 36:19.545
* Going all alone

36:19.578 --> 36:21.247
* Going all alone *

36:21.280 --> 36:22.914
* And I can't even trust

36:22.948 --> 36:25.851
* All the people here
inside my home *

36:25.884 --> 36:27.386
* Here inside my home *

36:27.419 --> 36:29.355
* But if you were my brother

36:29.388 --> 36:32.090
* Then never let it
get so wrong *

36:32.123 --> 36:34.025
* That you

36:34.059 --> 36:35.927
* Turn your back
on what we were *

36:35.961 --> 36:38.697
* Turn your back on me

36:38.730 --> 36:41.400
* On your family

36:41.433 --> 36:42.734
* No

36:42.768 --> 36:44.102
* Said I know

36:44.135 --> 36:45.904
* Said
I know *

36:45.937 --> 36:47.038
* Said I didn't need it

36:47.072 --> 36:48.740
* I said I wasn't built

36:48.774 --> 36:50.008
* For it

36:50.041 --> 36:51.777
* I wasn't built for this
HAKEEM: * Yeah

36:51.810 --> 36:53.044
* But now that I can see it

36:53.078 --> 36:54.880
* Damn right, I'm really made

36:54.913 --> 36:56.882
* For this
* I'm really made for this *

36:56.915 --> 36:57.883
* Chasing the sky

36:57.916 --> 37:00.252
* Oh

37:00.286 --> 37:02.087
* Trying to fly

37:02.120 --> 37:03.889
* So high
* Oh, yeah

37:03.922 --> 37:05.223
* Trying to fly
* So high

37:05.257 --> 37:06.892
* So high
* And now

37:06.925 --> 37:08.894
* I see
* Now I see *

37:08.927 --> 37:10.061
* Just why

37:10.095 --> 37:14.132
* You had to be so hard on me

37:14.165 --> 37:15.434
* So hard for me

37:15.467 --> 37:16.568
* You'll hear my roar

37:16.602 --> 37:19.438
* They'll feel your legacy

37:19.471 --> 37:20.606
* Your legacy *

37:20.639 --> 37:22.774
* Fear of the sky

37:22.808 --> 37:24.242
* To the sky *

37:24.276 --> 37:26.077
* No choice but to fly

37:26.111 --> 37:27.078
* So high
* Hands up

37:27.112 --> 37:30.081
* So high, so high.

37:30.115 --> 37:32.484
(piano playing main melody)

37:55.140 --> 37:56.775
(whoops)

37:56.808 --> 38:00.512
(people cheering)

38:05.784 --> 38:09.688
So, do we get our
primetime spot at the ASAs?

38:10.889 --> 38:12.624
Fire, fire...

38:12.658 --> 38:14.125
and more fire.

38:14.159 --> 38:16.127
You did it.

38:16.161 --> 38:17.128
Mama's a beast.

38:17.162 --> 38:18.797
Yeah, bro.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.332
COOKIE:
I'm a beast!

38:22.334 --> 38:24.135
Proud of her, right?

38:24.169 --> 38:25.637
Yes, I am.

38:25.671 --> 38:27.205
*

38:27.238 --> 38:28.707
If it was me, I'd be jealous

38:28.740 --> 38:30.141
that my sister
had everything

38:30.175 --> 38:32.711
and I had nothing...

38:32.744 --> 38:35.046
but I guess you
ain't that petty.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.485
Congratulations, y'all!
Thank you, baby.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.487
Y'all did it!

38:41.520 --> 38:43.221
JAMAL:
Derek, Derek.

38:43.254 --> 38:44.856
Yo, I'll catch up with you.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.829
Look, you-you want
to come by tonight?

38:50.862 --> 38:53.665
I thought you wasn't cool
with my deal.

38:55.367 --> 38:56.835
You know I don't
want to make you

38:56.868 --> 38:58.870
do anything you don't
feel comfortable with.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.374
I can handle it, okay?

39:03.942 --> 39:05.711
Okay.

39:07.245 --> 39:09.347
Later.

39:09.381 --> 39:12.418
*

39:12.451 --> 39:14.853
* Yeah.

39:16.722 --> 39:19.190
Mm, my God,
that wine looks so good.

39:19.224 --> 39:21.059
Mmm, it is.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.561
(chuckles)

39:22.594 --> 39:23.762
You should just
have a glass.

39:23.795 --> 39:24.930
One won't do anything.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.365
I know, I know.

39:27.399 --> 39:29.067
I'm just a little paranoid,

39:29.100 --> 39:31.069
especially after coming back
from the hospital, you know.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.070
Yeah.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.371
Plus, Mom would freak.

39:33.405 --> 39:34.940
She's obsessed.
If she had her way,

39:34.973 --> 39:37.409
I would completely
be on bed rest...

39:37.443 --> 39:40.712
which, actually,
does not sound so bad

39:40.746 --> 39:44.049
because, oh, my God,
my feet are killing me.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.251
I keep hearing about some

39:46.284 --> 39:48.554
burst of energy
during the second trimester.

39:48.587 --> 39:49.788
Still waiting.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.557
(groaning)

39:55.661 --> 39:57.963
Oh...

40:02.267 --> 40:03.234
Are you okay?

40:03.268 --> 40:04.736
Oh.
(clears throat)

40:04.770 --> 40:07.072
Yeah, I just feel
like this glass of wine

40:07.105 --> 40:08.907
is getting me light-headed
or something.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.476
Oh, good, good.

40:10.509 --> 40:13.078
Drink up for
the two of us.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.412
(sighs)

40:14.446 --> 40:15.447
(chuckles)

40:16.482 --> 40:18.884
LUCIOUS:
Mom, what are you doing?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.251
It's 3:00 in the morning.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.656
(wind blowing)

40:25.791 --> 40:27.726
What is all of this?

40:27.759 --> 40:29.127
Sit down.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.441
Where's Juanita?

40:43.475 --> 40:45.310
I sent her away.

40:45.343 --> 40:47.445
You know I don't
like anyone else

40:47.479 --> 40:48.780
cooking in my kitchen.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.448
You can't send her away.

40:50.482 --> 40:51.449
She lives here.

40:51.483 --> 40:52.484
She works for me.

40:52.518 --> 40:53.985
Not anymore.

40:56.522 --> 41:00.158
Sit down.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.870
Eat it.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.304
I'm not hungry.

41:13.338 --> 41:16.508
I won't ask again.

41:20.712 --> 41:21.980
I slaved

41:22.013 --> 41:23.348
for hours in that kitchen,

41:23.381 --> 41:25.817
baking these cakes for you.

41:27.052 --> 41:29.988
And what do you
do to repay me?

41:31.222 --> 41:34.526
You leave me all by myself.

41:34.560 --> 41:35.694
All alone.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.228
All day.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.496
Look, I have to work.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.065
Everybody leaves.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.833
First your father...

41:41.867 --> 41:43.168
No, my father didn't leave.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.870
He was murdered.
I saw it.

41:44.903 --> 41:47.372
Who brought all this
wickedness into our lives?

41:48.406 --> 41:49.841
You.

41:51.076 --> 41:54.680
I was fine until
you were born.

41:54.713 --> 42:00.351
All my troubles
came with you.

42:01.553 --> 42:03.589
Who told you to stop eating?

42:14.733 --> 42:17.235
Well?

42:17.268 --> 42:19.738
It's good.

42:22.908 --> 42:25.243
Do you love me?

42:33.418 --> 42:34.920
Liar.

42:34.953 --> 42:36.888
If you loved me,
you wouldn't have

42:36.922 --> 42:40.425
put me away
for 21 years.

42:40.458 --> 42:41.893
You were sick.

42:41.927 --> 42:44.730
You said so yourself.

42:44.763 --> 42:47.398
I was sick.

42:47.432 --> 42:51.569
Now I'm sorry.

42:51.603 --> 42:54.439
Sorry I was too weak

42:54.472 --> 42:57.075
to kill you
when I had the chance.

43:54.833 --> 43:55.801
Yeah.

43:55.834 --> 43:57.836
