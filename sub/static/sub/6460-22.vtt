Here's your grilled cheese.

00:04.905 --> 00:06.305
No crust.

00:06.307 --> 00:07.706
Cool.

00:07.708 --> 00:08.774
And can you just move

00:08.776 --> 00:12.044
your coloring materials, sir?

00:12.046 --> 00:13.445
Look.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.281
Pretty.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.984
I was born during
the Great Depression,

00:18.986 --> 00:21.353
and I never saw anything
as depressing

00:21.355 --> 00:25.824
as that grown-ass
white boy coloring

00:25.826 --> 00:29.261
in the damn coloring book.

00:29.263 --> 00:32.464
I was born during a
Def Leppard concert...

00:34.501 --> 00:38.237
And that is the most
depressing thing I've ever seen.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.505
I'm gonna go school him.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.907
Or, in his case,
pre-school him.

00:41.909 --> 00:43.375
Max, be gentle.

00:43.377 --> 00:47.212
I think he's in the middle
of his terrible 32s.

00:47.214 --> 00:50.549
Excuse me,
OshKosh B'gosh.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.552
I have a question about
your coloring book.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.087
Why?

00:55.089 --> 00:56.622
Oh, they're for adults.

00:56.624 --> 00:57.756
Super Zen.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.091
Super meditative.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.325
Helps with stress.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.294
You know what else
helps with stress?

01:02.296 --> 01:05.097
Sex.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.799
And even if someone
could get past

01:06.801 --> 01:09.368
those
boner-killing overalls...

01:09.370 --> 01:11.403
you ain't gonna have
any of that if you keep this up.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.305
Not to mention,
how stressful can your life

01:13.307 --> 01:16.675
really be if you are carefully
shading a unicorn's ass

01:16.677 --> 01:20.045

Sophie, having sex
with you pregnant

J. Crew claimed to have
a 50% off sale,

05:59.360 --> 06:03.595
but then I clicked on the link,
and it was an "up to" 50% sale.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.964

it does exclude the IMAX.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.495
You better make it

with another toe?

you need another one,

11:02.496 --> 11:04.596
and then they just
sit on the shelf.

11:04.598 --> 11:07.565
If I don't take his toes,
then I'm known as the guy

11:07.567 --> 11:12.103
who says he's gonna take toes
and then doesn't take toes.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.906
Uh, can I peruse
a song book?

11:14.908 --> 11:18.977
It might take a while,
I'm very picky.

11:25.585 --> 11:28.920

12:43.096 --> 12:44.529
No, by the time
they get back,

12:44.531 --> 12:48.199
Han will have one less toe,
if Hwang even stops there.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.567
What if he takes
his whole foot?

12:49.569 --> 12:53.471
Han needs all the height
he can get.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.207
Didn't you say something about
us having a money cushion?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.876
We can't use the cushion.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.812
We need it for the dessert bar

13:31.678 --> 13:34.445
but he gave us a cushion when
we didn't have anything.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.649
Max, I want to help Han,

<i>(rock music)</i>

13:59.172 --> 14:01.105
Chestnut,
we have big news.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.675
And something called mochi.

14:03.677 --> 14:04.876
RANDY: In here.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.878
I let myself in.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.947
Chestnut can talk?

14:08.949 --> 14:11.149
Thank you, God!

14:13.352 --> 14:15.920
What's up,
good looking?

14:15.922 --> 14:17.222
CAROLINE: I still can't believe

14:17.224 --> 14:19.090
you're dating someone
who looks like that,

14:19.092 --> 14:21.359
and can read.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.029
Randy, you will
not believe what we did.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.731
We saved Han's life.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.567
Well, not his life,
so much as his toe,

14:29.569 --> 14:33.504
but still an amazing
gesture on our part.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.339
Well...

14:34.341 --> 14:37.775
long story
about a short guy,

14:37.777 --> 14:42.113
we bought the diner.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.448
I had to get
something out of it.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.884
I mean,
I'm not Mother Teresa.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.785
You bought the diner?

14:47.787 --> 14:50.188
The diner that doesn't
show up on Google Maps

14:50.190 --> 14:51.689
for legal reasons?

14:51.691 --> 14:53.324
That diner?

14:53.326 --> 14:55.026
Why would you do that?

14:55.028 --> 14:56.828
Well, not bought, exactly.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.664
We got Han out of debt in
exchange for part ownership.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.867
It's like, we spend five years
trying to get out of hell,

15:02.869 --> 15:06.037
and then...
we bought hell!

15:06.039 --> 15:07.171
Crazy, right?

15:07.173 --> 15:09.574
Yeah, no, real crazy.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.943
When I think of impulse buys,
I think of Altoids

15:11.945 --> 15:14.078
or a flashlight keychain.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.282
Well, I guess
congratulations.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.816
Wait, what is that look
on your face?

15:18.818 --> 15:20.718
I've never seen it before.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.687
Are you mad?

15:22.689 --> 15:24.188
Just surprised
you didn't think

15:24.190 --> 15:26.024
to talk to me
about it first.

15:26.026 --> 15:30.862
What, every time I buy a diner,
I have to tell you?

15:30.864 --> 15:33.698
I go back to L.A.
in three days.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.266
You couldn't make
a plan for that,

15:35.268 --> 15:37.735
but you bought the diner?

15:37.737 --> 15:39.771
That's a commitment.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.773
Now it's done.

15:44.243 --> 15:47.645
I should go tell Chestnut
what we did.

15:47.647 --> 15:50.848
'Cause he is gonna laugh.

15:53.752 --> 15:56.754
I know what'll
make this all okay.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.023
Some jug snugs?

15:59.025 --> 16:01.993
Yours, not mine.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.728
Nothing?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.096
Well, if we're not
gonna do it,

16:05.098 --> 16:06.164
at least put on a shirt.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.566
I am human.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.435
You really think you're
gonna have time for us?

16:10.437 --> 16:13.604
Starting a new business
and owning the diner?

16:13.606 --> 16:14.672
Yes!

16:14.674 --> 16:16.507
I had four jobs
in sixth grade,

16:16.509 --> 16:20.011
and I still had time to follow
Smash Mouth around the country.

16:20.013 --> 16:24.449
Not the band, a meth head
my mom really liked.

16:24.451 --> 16:28.119
Chestnut had a big reaction to
the news, as well.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.088
Where's the poop shovel?

16:30.090 --> 16:31.422
<i>(rock music)</i>

16:34.960 --> 16:37.095
Hey, boss ladies,
congratulations!

16:37.097 --> 16:39.697
I heard that you own
the diner now.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.900
Which is why I am
doing double doobies.

16:44.803 --> 16:46.637
Part!
Part owners!

16:46.639 --> 16:47.739
I'm still the boss.

16:47.741 --> 16:48.740
Put that away!

16:48.742 --> 16:51.743
Doobie continued.

16:51.745 --> 16:55.313
Who's the boss,
Tiny Danza?

16:55.315 --> 16:58.282
Well, I will be again,
as soon as I scrape up

16:58.284 --> 16:59.984
the money to pay you back.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.419
But don't worry,
from now on,

17:01.421 --> 17:04.822
I'm not gambling on anything
but lunch at Chipotle.

17:06.692 --> 17:10.328
Hey, everybody!

17:10.330 --> 17:13.231
Sophie's back
and better than ever!

17:13.233 --> 17:16.834
Like racism in America.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.270
I heard that.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.506
Wow, Sophie,
that is some dress.

17:21.508 --> 17:25.443
And there must be one
very cold leopard out there.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.780
Oh, I like your style, baby.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.448
SOPHIE: I realized

17:30.450 --> 17:35.019
I don't need to wear those
basic bitch maternity clothes.

17:35.021 --> 17:39.390
I can be maternal without
losing that little whisper

17:39.392 --> 17:42.393
that says, "I'm doable."

17:44.430 --> 17:46.064
Yes, you are.

17:46.066 --> 17:49.367
She also made a maternity item
for the bedroom.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.770
It's called "The Pregligé."

17:52.772 --> 17:53.938
Hey, Oleg.

17:53.940 --> 17:57.141
Meet me in the bathroom.

18:01.513 --> 18:03.281
Hey, Earl,
I'm heading out.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.583
I guess we'll never get to do
that <i>Lethal Weapon</i> reboot

18:05.585 --> 18:07.485
we talked about.

18:07.487 --> 18:12.256
That's all right, I'm doing
a <i>Rush Hour</i> reboot with Han.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.991
What're you doing
with that luggage?

18:13.993 --> 18:16.394
Did I get you kicked out
of another hotel?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.463
No, I changed my ticket.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.798
Going back to L.A. today.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.366
But that's today.

18:22.368 --> 18:25.703
And that is a ticket
to Los Angeles.

18:25.705 --> 18:29.740
Use it whenever you want
and I'll be there.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.042
This is empty.

18:31.044 --> 18:34.712
Yeah, everything's
done online now.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.381
I just did that
for effect.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.283
You'll get an email.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.620
Good luck with your dessert bar
and the diner.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.422
I'm gonna see you.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.424
Yeah.

18:53.832 --> 18:56.234
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.469
Why are you being
so good-bye-y?

18:58.471 --> 19:01.405
I'm gonna visit as soon as
things get settled here.

19:01.407 --> 19:02.907
And we'll talk every day.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.743
I'm even better at phone sex
than I am at real sex.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.278
I find that
hard to believe.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.781
It's the only thing on
my resumé that's not a lie.

19:10.783 --> 19:14.619
I'll figure it out.
We'll make a plan.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.187
I know you think that.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.356
But I think I was right
the first time.

19:18.358 --> 19:21.259
Long-distance relationships
don't work.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.928
And I think the real
distance between us

19:23.930 --> 19:26.164
is where we are
in our lives.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.131
What distance?

19:27.133 --> 19:30.334
I'm three inches away
from you.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.672
You better get back
to your diner.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.874
I love you, Max.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.912
I love you, too.

19:45.751 --> 19:48.953
Okay, that felt
really good-bye-y.

19:56.762 --> 19:57.962
I'm okay, Earl.

19:57.964 --> 20:01.165
This is for me.

20:02.601 --> 20:06.070
I know this is really hard,
but you don't know where

20:06.072 --> 20:07.438
this all is gonna end up.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.841
Like you, when you ride
the subway on ecstasy.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.579
Are you okay?

20:14.581 --> 20:17.114
I am the opposite of okay.

20:18.984 --> 20:23.020
You know, as the boss,
I could let you take a break.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.755
I mean, ten minutes, tops.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.257
If I give you more
than ten minutes,

20:26.259 --> 20:28.059
then I'll be known
as the girl who says

20:28.061 --> 20:29.327
she's gonna give
ten minutes,

20:29.329 --> 20:32.663
then doesn't give
ten minutes.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.365
I need to talk
to the owner.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.533
BOTH: That's me!

20:35.535 --> 20:39.737
Oh, that was really painful.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.940
And probably worse
than losing a toe.
