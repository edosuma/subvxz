I wish to peruse the news.

03:28.335 --> 03:32.003
There should be something about
the Bruce Wayne kidnapping.

03:32.005 --> 03:34.805
Ladies and gentlemen, with
Gotham City still reeling

03:34.807 --> 03:37.073
from the great sphinx mystery,
another shocking blow

03:37.075 --> 03:40.076
has landed when Mr. Bruce Wayne,
philanthropist and millionaire

03:40.078 --> 03:42.611
of our town was kidnapped
in broad daylight.

03:42.613 --> 03:45.814
You know all that.
Switch back to the sports.

03:45.816 --> 03:48.883
For the latest development
in this fast-moving story

03:48.885 --> 03:50.184
we switch to mobile unit five

03:50.186 --> 03:52.819
station at Gotham City
Police Headquarters.

03:52.821 --> 03:53.986
Come in, Commissioner Gordon.

03:53.988 --> 03:56.688
For the latest word on
the Bruce Wayne kidnapping

03:56.690 --> 03:59.590
I'm proud to present
my never-failing aid in the war

03:59.592 --> 04:05.629
against crime...the one
and only, Batman.

04:06.698 --> 04:07.631
Thank you, commissioner.

04:08.133 --> 04:09.932
First I'd like to assure
Mr. Bruce Wayne's

04:09.934 --> 04:12.734
many friends and associates
that he is unharmed

04:12.736 --> 04:14.636
'and will soon
be returned home.'

04:14.638 --> 04:15.803
What?

04:15.805 --> 04:17.704
Batman!

04:17.706 --> 04:19.305
He turns me on.

04:19.307 --> 04:25.344
Nefertiti, we could
have you filleted for that.

04:25.346 --> 04:27.512
But he's so handsome

04:27.514 --> 04:30.214
and clean-cut, and groovy.

04:30.616 --> 04:34.450
We forbid you to speak well
of our deadliest enemy.

04:34.452 --> 04:37.219
Astonishing news, Batman,
but how do you know all this?

04:37.221 --> 04:39.554
Because I myself
rescued Mr. Wayne

04:39.556 --> 04:40.755
'not more than 10 minutes ago.'

04:40.757 --> 04:45.025
That's a trick.
You're lying, Batman.

04:45.027 --> 04:46.026
Where are my ministers?

04:46.028 --> 04:48.762
What's happened
to those ninnies?

04:49.631 --> 04:51.731
'Uh, in your
expert opinion, Batman'

04:51.733 --> 04:55.101
'what's behind all these
mysterious occurrences?'

04:55.103 --> 04:56.869
In my expert opinion,
commissioner

04:56.871 --> 04:59.171
we're seeing the dust
of centuries blown away

04:59.173 --> 05:03.175
with a monstrous revival
of a strange and ancient cult.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.310
- It's unearthly.
- Perhaps.

05:05.312 --> 05:09.647
I'll know more, after I've
dwelled into the secret archives

05:09.649 --> 05:12.550
of the antiquarian library
in Alexandria.

05:12.552 --> 05:13.217
Alexandria?

05:13.219 --> 05:16.086
Oh, you mean the delightful
suburb of Washington D.C.

05:16.088 --> 05:17.954
No, commissioner.
Alexandria, Egypt.

05:17.956 --> 05:21.190
'That ancient metropolis at
the mouth of the River Nile.'

05:21.192 --> 05:23.058
You're leaving for Egypt?

05:23.060 --> 05:25.126
'By the first available jet.'

05:25.128 --> 05:27.628
'I have vital researches
to perform.'

05:27.630 --> 05:29.062
But, great Scott, Batman.

05:29.064 --> 05:31.230
What will become of us
during your absence?

05:31.232 --> 05:34.099
Who will block the criminal
schemes of this madman

05:34.101 --> 05:36.033
who calls himself King Tut?

05:36.035 --> 05:39.571
'I pass the Egyptian ball
to you, commissioner. In my..'

05:41.174 --> 05:45.276
He called me a madman, does he?

05:45.278 --> 05:47.878
We'll let's face it, Tut Tut.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.781
Face what, sweet,
lovely Nefertiti?

05:51.783 --> 05:54.083
In the old days when you
were professor at Yale

05:54.085 --> 05:58.320
before you got conked on
the head in that student riot--

06:03.593 --> 06:07.261
Royal torturers,
servants of the fierce

06:07.263 --> 06:09.029
Jackal God of Anubis.

06:09.031 --> 06:11.998
To my bidding..

06:14.901 --> 06:17.335
She's my subversive queen.

06:17.337 --> 06:20.037
To the dungeons with her!

06:21.707 --> 06:23.173
No! No!

06:23.475 --> 06:25.074
No!

06:25.809 --> 06:27.543
No!

06:27.545 --> 06:28.844
No!

06:30.179 --> 06:33.648
Mad am I?

06:33.650 --> 06:35.716
Well, you'll see

06:35.718 --> 06:42.956
while Batman is bouncing around
in belfries in far off Egypt.

06:42.958 --> 06:47.193
I'll do what I
set out to do before.

06:47.195 --> 06:50.829
I've got Bruce Wayne!

07:00.171 --> 07:01.137
Holy travel agent, Batman!

07:01.139 --> 07:03.806
- Are you really going to Egypt?
- Of course not, Robin.

07:03.808 --> 07:06.575
It's merely a clever strategem
I've worked out.

07:06.577 --> 07:09.644
I have a hunch King Tut
will make another effort

07:09.646 --> 07:10.544
to kidnap Bruce Wayne.

07:10.546 --> 07:12.946
I get it, and we'll
foil 'em, huh?

07:12.948 --> 07:16.749
On the contrary,
I wish him to succeed.

07:16.751 --> 07:20.519
What? You're gonna
let yourself be kidnapped?

07:20.521 --> 07:23.855
Yes, Robin. Yes and no.

07:23.857 --> 07:26.724
Before today's
dark deeds unfold

07:26.726 --> 07:29.093
I want Aunt Harriet
safely out of the way.

07:29.095 --> 07:31.895
Get on the phone.
Call the house upstairs.

07:33.165 --> 07:34.430
Goodbye, Alfred.

07:34.432 --> 07:39.368
Now be sure Dick gets his warm
milk before retiring, won't you?

07:39.370 --> 07:41.436
You may rest assured
of it, madam.

07:41.438 --> 07:45.206
Just imagine, Alfred,
a weekend in the country.

07:45.208 --> 07:48.209
Oh, it's going to be
such a delightful change!

07:48.211 --> 07:53.280
Well, I better run, so the taxi
man won't grow impatient.

08:09.095 --> 08:12.897
Gosh, Batman! That sure
a lifelike dummy of Bruce Wayne.

08:12.899 --> 08:14.965
Hmm. It should
serve the purpose.

08:14.967 --> 08:17.300
Deception and double deception.

08:17.302 --> 08:21.537
The only way to deal with
a super criminal like Tut.

08:23.607 --> 08:24.573
Alfred?

08:25.175 --> 08:27.575
Oh, Alfred, have you
seen the novel

08:27.577 --> 08:29.043
I've been reading anywhere?

08:29.045 --> 08:30.010
I.. Well, no, madam, I-I..

08:30.012 --> 08:33.513
Oh, of course, I left it
on the table.. Or the sofa.

08:33.515 --> 08:36.448
Mrs. Cooper, shh.

08:36.783 --> 08:37.448
Oh.

08:46.424 --> 08:49.592
Sweet dreams, Bruce dear.

08:58.901 --> 09:00.535
Phew!

09:00.702 --> 09:03.637
Holy, taxidermy.
That dummy sure passed the test.

09:03.639 --> 09:06.573
'Indeed, Robin.<i> Cum laude.'</i>

09:06.575 --> 09:08.841
It's time to get set, Robin.

09:08.843 --> 09:11.109
It's almost <i> oda wadda simba.</i>

09:11.111 --> 09:13.177
- Almost what?
-<i> Oda wadda simba.</i>

09:13.179 --> 09:15.579
6 o'clock in our nomenclature.

09:15.581 --> 09:17.647
In the 14th Dynasty

09:17.649 --> 09:20.216
the Hour of the Hyena.

09:20.218 --> 09:21.250
The time when ancient Egyptian

09:21.252 --> 09:23.752
super criminals
invariably struck.

09:23.754 --> 09:26.054
Gosh, Batman, is there
anything you don't know?

09:26.056 --> 09:30.224
Hmm. Oh yes, Robin.
Several things in fact.

09:30.226 --> 09:32.059
All prepared, sir.

09:35.229 --> 09:37.330
Now the hyenas are at the gate.

09:37.332 --> 09:40.666
Who knows what form they'll
take, Alfred.

09:50.076 --> 09:50.975
Can I help you?

09:50.977 --> 09:54.244
Sure you can. I've been
sent over by the chief

09:54.246 --> 09:55.878
to watch over Mr. Wayne.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.813
In case those devilish
kidnappers

09:57.815 --> 09:58.747
should try to strike again.

09:58.749 --> 10:01.816
Ah, yes.
A wise precaution, officer.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.017
If you'll follow me.

10:06.887 --> 10:10.589
As you observe, the master's
enjoying a moment's respite

10:10.591 --> 10:11.856
bit from the day's cares.

10:11.858 --> 10:14.024
'Would the real almighty
enjoy such fortune?'

10:14.026 --> 10:18.028
Don't worry, buster,
it can be arranged.

10:44.187 --> 10:48.290
Extraordinary how
that anti gas pill works.

10:48.924 --> 10:51.258
Shh. No one talk now.

11:12.379 --> 11:15.381
Quick! Take him
to the royal barque.

11:30.962 --> 11:32.462
Wow! Worked like a charm.

11:32.464 --> 11:33.629
Batman, figured
every move they make.

11:33.631 --> 11:37.199
I never doubted, but he would,
Master Robin. What now?

11:37.201 --> 11:40.101
We track 'em on the bat-scanner
to their criminal hideout.

11:40.103 --> 11:42.503
Quick, Alfred! You go
to the service elevator.

11:42.505 --> 11:44.372
I'll meet you in the Bat-cave.

11:44.374 --> 11:45.106
Roger.

12:08.961 --> 12:10.261
'Commissioner, this is Robin.'

12:10.263 --> 12:11.095
Y-Yes, Boy Wonder.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.231
A-Okay, commissioner.
They've got Bruce Wayne.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.666
Only it's really Batman, right?

12:16.668 --> 12:17.466
'Right.'

12:17.468 --> 12:18.467
Heartwarming indeed, Boy Wonder,

12:18.469 --> 12:21.069
the way a distinguished
millionaire like Bruce Wayne

12:21.071 --> 12:22.603
cooperates in the fight
against crime.

12:22.605 --> 12:25.939
Not all millionaires would
be so self-sacrificing.

12:25.941 --> 12:28.041
I'll tell him
you said so, commissioner.

12:28.043 --> 12:30.443
In the meantime standby
with your full force.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.677
You're tracking
the criminals, are you?

12:31.679 --> 12:35.147
Signals from the tiny homing
transmitter in Batman's collar

12:35.149 --> 12:36.114
are coming in perfectly.

12:36.116 --> 12:39.150
I'll call you back when I
learn about King Tut's hideout.

12:39.152 --> 12:41.519
Bless you, Boy Wonder.
Chief O'Hara and I

12:41.521 --> 12:43.988
will stay by the Bat-phone.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.095
Look at them, Alfred.
Tracking perfectly.

12:52.097 --> 12:54.130
Those poor demented felons.

12:54.132 --> 12:58.567
How little did they want? But
they have a tiger by the tail.

13:02.237 --> 13:03.971
- Peculiar.
- What?

13:03.973 --> 13:08.976
"Message of Anubis
interprets itself as follows.

13:08.978 --> 13:12.479
"What seems is not,
inside its bonds

13:12.481 --> 13:15.181
"the leopard has
changed its spots."

13:18.718 --> 13:21.519
Yeah.

13:21.521 --> 13:24.321
But then on the other hand..

13:24.588 --> 13:28.591
...there's no extra charge
for making sure.

13:46.374 --> 13:48.875
'Oh, glip!
Cold as a cucumber.'

13:48.877 --> 13:51.577
Could it be a defect in
the receiver, Master Robin?

13:51.579 --> 13:54.113
Quick! Activate the
emergency backup receivers.

13:54.115 --> 13:55.681
Roger.

13:58.951 --> 14:00.750
Emergency system at full gain.

14:00.752 --> 14:04.487
Holy high-flying!
Something's gone wrong.

14:05.456 --> 14:07.690
Tick tock.

14:08.692 --> 14:11.326
Tick tock.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.995
Enjoying yourself, Batman?

14:13.997 --> 14:17.965
The dreaded ancient
Theban pebble torture.

14:17.967 --> 14:21.735
- You pitiable madman.
- Tick tock.

14:21.902 --> 14:26.005
Chief torturer,
what's the pebble count

14:26.007 --> 14:29.008
on my faithless ex-queen?

14:29.010 --> 14:32.945
'901, Oh Great Pharaoh!'

14:33.313 --> 14:36.748
901? Good.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.883
Less than 100 to go

14:38.885 --> 14:41.886
and then she'll
smash herself to pieces

14:41.888 --> 14:46.056
trying to tear herself
out of a jar.

14:46.257 --> 14:49.759
In the name of mercy,
think back to the days

14:49.761 --> 14:54.029
'when you were a distinguished
professor at Yale University.'

14:54.864 --> 14:55.864
Give yourself up.

14:55.866 --> 15:00.068
I vow that you'll receive
the finest medical attention.

15:00.070 --> 15:02.970
Chief torturer, hold.

15:02.972 --> 15:06.273
What's the pebble count
on Batman?

15:06.275 --> 15:10.777
'297, Oh Great Pharaoh!'

15:12.479 --> 15:13.946
Speed it up.

15:14.348 --> 15:18.249
Alfred, if we ever had need
of our brain power it's now.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.751
Here are the last
four fixes we've got.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.419
The problem is
to extrapolate them.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.455
Project them to the criminal's
putative destination.

15:25.457 --> 15:29.692
Correct, and if we extend
their azimuth like this

15:29.694 --> 15:30.693
correcting from one way--

15:30.695 --> 15:33.929
How peculiar. It leads us
to this vacant area

15:33.931 --> 15:37.432
that coordinates 47 to 61.

15:37.434 --> 15:38.566
Wait a minute!

15:40.937 --> 15:43.904
Coordinates 47 to 61.

15:45.072 --> 15:45.638
Holy foxtrot!

15:45.640 --> 15:50.042
The Egyptian palace from last
year's Gotham City exposition.

15:56.381 --> 15:57.314
Robin speaking.

15:57.316 --> 15:58.982
'We've just had a message.'

15:58.984 --> 16:01.951
King Tut is holding Batman
is his secret hideout.

16:01.953 --> 16:04.887
He will exchange him
for $1 million in cash.

16:04.889 --> 16:06.922
To be delivered personally
by Bruce Wayne.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.290
You think it's on
the level, commissioner?

16:08.292 --> 16:11.893
I do. But unfortunately I can't
get a hold of Bruce Wayne.

16:11.895 --> 16:13.527
There's no answer
at his stately mansion.

16:13.529 --> 16:17.497
Don't worry. I'm on my way
to find him right this second.

16:17.499 --> 16:19.565
Goodbye, commissioner.

16:19.567 --> 16:22.501
Are you sure that was
prudent, Master Robin?

16:22.503 --> 16:23.268
What, Alfred?

16:23.270 --> 16:26.204
Well, they're pretty certain
of the whereabouts

16:26.206 --> 16:27.038
of King Tut's hideout.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.474
Should we not have informed the
police and requested their aid?

16:30.476 --> 16:33.577
I didn't dare chance it.
They're great guys, Alfred

16:33.579 --> 16:35.579
but they can be
heavy-handed too

16:35.581 --> 16:38.315
and when those
fiends have Batman..

16:38.317 --> 16:39.249
I follow your thinking.

16:39.251 --> 16:41.651
The rude intrusion of
the police might have provoked

16:41.653 --> 16:44.587
the criminals to some
unhappy act of violence.

16:44.589 --> 16:47.456
Right, Alfred. This one
we've gotta pull ourselves.

16:47.458 --> 16:49.624
- To the Batmobile.
- To the..

16:49.626 --> 16:51.993
...Batmobile?
But you don't have

16:51.995 --> 16:55.096
a license to drive,
Master Robin.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.264
But you do.

17:01.169 --> 17:03.369
♪ Twinkle twinkle little bat ♪

17:03.371 --> 17:06.605
♪ How I wonder
what you're at ♪♪

17:07.941 --> 17:12.242
Chief torturer, what's
the latest pebble count?

17:12.244 --> 17:15.945
'Coming down now,
Oh Mighty Pharaoh.'

17:15.948 --> 17:19.482
'...number 1000.'

17:22.018 --> 17:25.319
Bring them to my throne room.

17:29.091 --> 17:32.292
Let it be a warning,
loyal subjects.

17:32.294 --> 17:33.626
Our enemies shall be reduced

17:33.628 --> 17:37.730
even as these
to mindless slaves.

17:37.732 --> 17:41.533
Smash open their cases.

17:52.678 --> 17:55.379
Dance, you slaves.

17:55.381 --> 17:58.215
Dance for our amusement!

17:58.217 --> 18:01.751
Music. Bat-music.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.264
Take him.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.399
Thought you unhinge, did you?

18:55.401 --> 18:58.101
I fooled you.
I kept my reason by reciting

18:58.103 --> 19:00.703
the multiplication
tables backwards.

19:03.174 --> 19:05.807
Hold on, Batman.
I'm with you.

19:34.933 --> 19:36.400
Where is King Tut?

19:36.402 --> 19:38.668
Looks like he's gone, Batman.

19:38.670 --> 19:40.670
We'd better net him fast.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.204
The Batmobile, it's gone!

19:42.206 --> 19:45.407
Alfred, old fella,
are you alright?

19:46.442 --> 19:48.643
Most remissive me, sir.

19:48.645 --> 19:51.746
I let that ruffian overpower me.

19:52.180 --> 19:52.913
Only one thing to do.

19:52.915 --> 19:56.383
Pursue him in this curious
royal barque.

20:17.502 --> 20:19.436
Visual contact established.

20:19.905 --> 20:23.773
If he cuts into superpower
afterburner we'll never keep up.

20:39.354 --> 20:41.888
Holy smoke!
What'll we do now, Batman?

20:41.890 --> 20:44.824
Quick, hand me your tiny
utility belt transmitter.

20:44.826 --> 20:45.658
Mine is disabled.

20:45.660 --> 20:49.328
I get it. You're gonna try to
remote control Batmobile circuit

20:49.330 --> 20:50.262
via the Bat-cave relay link.

20:50.264 --> 20:52.497
Right, Robin,
it's our only chance.

20:52.499 --> 20:53.865
Batman to Bat-cave.

20:53.867 --> 21:00.872
'Voice control Batmobile
relay circuit switch on.'

21:04.341 --> 21:08.944
Batmobile ejection seat. Fire.

21:13.016 --> 21:15.249
What the heck!
The failure signal.

21:15.251 --> 21:17.417
Circuits on the blink,
I'm afraid.

21:17.419 --> 21:17.984
How can it be?

21:17.986 --> 21:21.554
Human mechanisms are made
by human hands, Robin.

21:21.556 --> 21:22.721
None of them is infallible.

21:22.723 --> 21:25.457
It's a lesson which
must be faced.

21:25.992 --> 21:28.726
- Hey, look!
- 'He's coming back at us.'

21:37.567 --> 21:38.600
What the heck!

21:38.602 --> 21:41.269
Look out, he's found
the Bat-beam.

21:46.273 --> 21:47.006
Farewell.

21:47.008 --> 21:51.977
We rid Thebes forever
of its rodents.

21:58.047 --> 21:59.781
Holy sky rocket!

21:59.915 --> 22:04.285
He hit the Bat-beam button
and the ejector seat went off.

22:23.635 --> 22:24.635
Well hit, sir.

22:25.037 --> 22:28.338
Gosh! And to think
he was once a famous professor

22:28.340 --> 22:29.205
in Yale University.

22:29.207 --> 22:32.875
That's life, Robin.
Full of ups and downs.

22:32.877 --> 22:36.912
It'll be if it's any of us
to grow too confident.

22:46.623 --> 22:47.723
A tragic case, Batman.

22:47.725 --> 22:50.625
One of the saddest which
has ever crossed my ken.

22:50.627 --> 22:52.994
- There maybe hope for him yet.
- But how?

22:52.996 --> 22:53.894
With proper treatment.

22:53.896 --> 22:56.129
Mental institutions
are hopelessly overcrowded.

22:56.131 --> 22:59.198
The taxpayers are blind
to our pleas.

23:00.567 --> 23:02.134
What about the Wayne Foundation?

23:02.136 --> 23:04.569
Gosh, yes!
It's a great idea, Batman.

23:04.571 --> 23:06.837
But do you think
Mr. Wayne'll go for it

23:06.839 --> 23:09.172
after being kidnapped
by this devil?

23:09.174 --> 23:14.510
Chief O'Hara, I understand that
Mr. Bruce Wayne is a man of

23:14.512 --> 23:16.444
great understanding
and compassion.

23:16.446 --> 23:19.848
I'll phone Bruce Wayne instantly
and ask him to come over here.

23:19.850 --> 23:21.516
- Watch out.
- Argh!

23:21.518 --> 23:23.017
He's wakin' up.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.621
I-I must..

23:27.623 --> 23:31.524
Young gentlemen rioting
is not going..

23:31.892 --> 23:33.959
Be careful. Ooh!

23:39.598 --> 23:41.031
Ohh!

23:42.666 --> 23:45.467
What an amazing dream.

23:45.701 --> 23:49.570
- I must be late for class.
- Late for class?

23:49.804 --> 23:52.705
Yes. Egyptology..

23:58.911 --> 24:01.579
Oh...my..

24:04.649 --> 24:06.216
What is this?

24:06.684 --> 24:08.751
A miracle, professor.

24:09.052 --> 24:11.520
Simply a miracle.

24:13.523 --> 24:14.823
Oh..

24:15.891 --> 24:18.726
Oh, whatever will the dean say?
