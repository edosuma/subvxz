WEBVTT

00:56.900 --> 00:58.967
From the file from the NSS,

00:59.066 --> 01:03.767
Hyun-jun finds out that his parents
were assassinated by San Baek.

01:03.867 --> 01:06.700
He goes to see his priest
to ask about his past,

01:06.767 --> 01:08.667
but he arrives too late.

01:13.333 --> 01:14.967
The owner of the voice calls Hyun-jun

01:15.033 --> 01:17.266
to tell him about his parents

01:17.400 --> 01:21.533
and persuades him to stop
nuclear terrorism in Korea.

01:24.166 --> 01:27.667
Iris is preparing
a nuclear terror attack in Seoul.

01:28.867 --> 01:29.767
The President,

01:29.834 --> 01:33.967
despite the possible nuclear terrorism,
states he'll enforce the summit.

01:34.033 --> 01:37.467
I will not give in to them.

01:37.533 --> 01:40.100
Proceed the summit as scheduled.

01:42.667 --> 01:43.567
Sa-woo

01:43.633 --> 01:47.333
tries to disturb the NSS
from tracing the terrorists.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.834
CHOOSE DATA DELETE

01:49.400 --> 01:50.867
Try to buy more time.

01:59.500 --> 02:00.967
EPISODE 13

03:25.066 --> 03:26.834
-Captain.
-What is it?

03:27.600 --> 03:30.934
She was watching us while being armed.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.934
Shall I find out

03:35.967 --> 03:37.066
who she is?

03:37.133 --> 03:38.667
We don't have time. Kill her.

03:38.734 --> 03:39.667
Wait.

03:40.967 --> 03:41.867
She's from

03:42.800 --> 03:44.100
the NSS.

03:45.567 --> 03:47.233
When we were in the NSS,

03:47.300 --> 03:49.266
she contacted someone outside.

03:49.734 --> 03:50.633
That's her.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.266
Does that mean

03:56.767 --> 03:57.934
she killed

03:58.300 --> 04:00.667
A1 and A2?

04:06.834 --> 04:07.834
Wait.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.200
Lower your gun.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.967
Hyun-jun, do you know her?

04:36.934 --> 04:38.066
No.

04:39.467 --> 04:40.467
In the NSS,

04:41.900 --> 04:45.367
we only know people
within the same department.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.667
Take her.

04:53.433 --> 04:54.633
Everyone, move now.

05:09.266 --> 05:11.600
Switch from S1 to AR from now on.

05:11.667 --> 05:15.100
Start the operation as soon as we receive
information from the HQ.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.734
Did you connect to the satellite?

05:20.800 --> 05:22.333
Not yet.

05:22.934 --> 05:24.934
The SWAT will arrive at the site soon.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.900
We need to send
the site information before they do.

05:26.967 --> 05:29.333
I can't pick up connection signal at all.

05:30.934 --> 05:32.433
The signal is disconnected.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.633
There's a problem
in the satellite server.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.767
Figure out why now.

05:35.934 --> 05:36.767
Okay, sir.

05:40.734 --> 05:41.600
It's me.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.133
Satellite support seems difficult.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.734
There's a problem with the connection.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.033
No,

05:48.100 --> 05:49.967
it's risky to proceed
without the satellite support.

05:50.066 --> 05:52.300
Get to your position at the site and wait.

05:59.934 --> 06:01.734
Team one, front gate in the west.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.066
Team two, rear gate in the east.

06:03.233 --> 06:04.233
Team three, both sides.

06:04.300 --> 06:05.400
Go now.

06:21.433 --> 06:22.967
Team two, position secured.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.100
Team three, position secured.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.233
Do we keep waiting?

06:33.533 --> 06:34.467
Start the operation.

06:52.567 --> 06:53.900
Sierra one, clear.

06:53.967 --> 06:55.200
Sierra two, clear.

06:55.266 --> 06:56.567
Sierra three, clear.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.734
Team one, in position.

06:57.800 --> 06:58.734
Team two, three, enter.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.266
Seize fire!

07:17.400 --> 07:19.734
Everyone, hold your position.

07:56.734 --> 07:59.400
Did two men get killed by this woman?

08:00.166 --> 08:01.400
You're pathetic.

08:01.467 --> 08:03.066
Shut up, you bastard.

08:04.667 --> 08:05.567
You.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.734
What did you tell the captain
to keep her alive?

08:08.800 --> 08:10.567
She could be of use.

08:12.066 --> 08:13.200
For what?

08:14.700 --> 08:15.967
You'll see.

08:44.367 --> 08:45.867
We were one minute late.

08:45.934 --> 08:48.934
We lost three people
in a booby trap they installed.

08:49.100 --> 08:49.934
What about Seung-hee?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.200
We haven't found her.

08:51.367 --> 08:53.266
Can't we trace with the satellite?

08:53.333 --> 08:54.233
It's not working yet.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.700
Are we going to lose her like this?

08:55.767 --> 08:57.967
We must find another way to find her.

08:58.066 --> 08:59.700
We're looking into it. Calm down.

09:02.533 --> 09:04.400
We found Ms. Choi's car.

09:11.767 --> 09:13.133
We searched the vicinity,

09:13.200 --> 09:14.967
but there's no trace of her.

09:16.233 --> 09:18.967
Then we can't track her location anymore.

10:13.233 --> 10:14.367
What happened?

10:14.967 --> 10:17.066
She's locked in the basement engine room.

10:17.867 --> 10:18.867
She's safe,

10:19.533 --> 10:20.867
so don't worry.

10:27.533 --> 10:29.533
He said he needs to find out something.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.767
She'll be fine for now.

10:32.834 --> 10:34.400
And after he finds out?

10:35.934 --> 10:37.066
He'll kill her.

10:41.066 --> 10:42.100
I must save her before then.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.667
I understand you're worried,

10:43.834 --> 10:45.333
but you must stay objective.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.900
All of them are elite Supreme Guards.

10:49.867 --> 10:51.867
If something goes wrong and you die,

10:52.367 --> 10:54.667
there's no way to stop nuclear terrorism.

11:04.133 --> 11:06.333
If the gun is registered under the NSS,

11:06.467 --> 11:08.734
we'll be able to identify her.

11:09.567 --> 11:11.033
Search the system.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.433
I expected it.

11:28.867 --> 11:30.600
She has access to classified information.

11:30.667 --> 11:31.667
Level one.

11:38.700 --> 11:39.533
Gather up.

11:48.967 --> 11:51.967
You must be wondering about
our next operation.

11:52.033 --> 11:54.667
I'll tell you what it is,
so listen carefully.

11:54.834 --> 11:56.900
Our duty is to stop

11:57.066 --> 11:58.967
the North and South summit in progress.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.200
How?

12:05.266 --> 12:07.066
In the center of Seoul,

12:07.133 --> 12:08.834
a nuclear bomb will explode.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.934
What we brought from the NSS

12:16.033 --> 12:18.333
was an ultra-precision detonator.

12:19.567 --> 12:21.834
Once it's fused with concentrated uranium,

12:22.166 --> 12:24.133
it becomes a nuclear weapon.

12:24.767 --> 12:26.834
Where is the nuclear weapon now?

12:27.367 --> 12:29.166
I can't tell you that.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.233
The location and time

12:32.400 --> 12:34.934
of the nuclear bombing
haven't been decided yet.

12:39.233 --> 12:40.867
Why did you let her live?

12:42.300 --> 12:43.500
She is

12:43.967 --> 12:45.900
the Team Leader of
the NSS Counter-terrorism Division.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.700
Her name is Seung-hee Choi.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.667
She has access to
level one classified information.

12:49.734 --> 12:51.934
If we find out the security code from her,

12:52.000 --> 12:53.467
our work becomes easy.

12:53.533 --> 12:55.266
I'll do that.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.667
We should take revenge on

12:59.000 --> 13:00.200
her killing of A1 and A2.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.266
Hyun-jun Kim.

13:06.633 --> 13:08.400
You find that out from her.

13:09.233 --> 13:11.533
Since you're both NSS agents,

13:12.333 --> 13:15.400
you'll know how to make her

13:16.433 --> 13:17.767
talk.

13:19.300 --> 13:22.166
Find out as soon as possible
by using any necessary means.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.467
Why couldn't we trace by satellite?

13:38.166 --> 13:39.533
There's a problem with the server.

13:39.600 --> 13:40.967
What's the reason?

13:41.033 --> 13:42.567
We're trying to figure it out.

13:44.166 --> 13:47.166
How could you not know that
when all you do is sit

13:47.233 --> 13:48.967
in front of the computer?

13:49.066 --> 13:50.467
You're getting out of line.

13:50.533 --> 13:51.500
What?

13:51.567 --> 13:53.567
Do you understand the current situation?

13:53.633 --> 13:56.266
Ms. Choi has been
kidnapped by the terrorists,

13:56.333 --> 13:58.867
but we have no idea where they are.

13:58.934 --> 14:02.166
We wouldn't have lost them so easily
if we traced them with the satellite.

14:02.233 --> 14:03.433
Stop it.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.934
How can we operate when
the rear support slacks off?

14:07.033 --> 14:08.967
Isn't this how
the headquarters get attacked?

14:09.166 --> 14:10.433
Stop it!

14:24.867 --> 14:26.166
Please understand him.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.533
Eight members of the SWAT are
in critical condition.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.467
Mi-jeong, call the counter-terrorism team
for an emergency meeting

14:33.734 --> 14:34.734
Yes, sir.

14:40.300 --> 14:41.633
Hey, listen.

14:41.700 --> 14:42.867
Is it true that

14:42.934 --> 14:45.266
the terrorists are holding
Seung-hee hostage?

14:46.433 --> 14:47.800
It's very likely.

14:47.867 --> 14:51.667
I heard Seung-hee connected
to the satellite on your computer.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.200
I didn't think she'd do
something so reckless.

14:56.867 --> 14:59.200
But I still don't understand.

14:59.266 --> 15:03.133
How could she go there
by herself so carelessly?

15:04.533 --> 15:08.367
By the way,
can you guess why she did that?

15:10.066 --> 15:13.533
Seung-hee believes
TK1 is one of the terrorists.

15:14.333 --> 15:17.033
What? Do you mean Hyun-jun?

15:18.100 --> 15:20.300
Is it plausible?

15:20.633 --> 15:22.967
When the terrorists came to the NSS,

15:23.133 --> 15:24.934
she saw them face to face.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.967
Perhaps Seung-hee acted recklessly

15:27.333 --> 15:29.567
because she thought
she must arrive at the site

15:29.633 --> 15:31.233
before the SWAT.

15:32.066 --> 15:34.000
Team Leader Seung-hee Choi

15:34.200 --> 15:36.934
is mostly likely kidnapped
by the terrorists.

15:37.633 --> 15:40.066
We have no idea about the location
of the terrorists

15:40.133 --> 15:41.567
who were hiding in an asbestos factory

15:41.633 --> 15:43.300
in Seoksu, Anyang.

15:44.233 --> 15:47.100
The reason why we must find
the terrorists as soon as possible

15:47.333 --> 15:50.100
is that they're preparing
a nuclear terror attack.

15:53.934 --> 15:55.767
When the NSS was attacked,

15:55.834 --> 15:58.166
the terrorists took
an ultra-precision detonator

15:58.233 --> 16:01.166
used for nuclear attack
which was kept in the R&D room.

16:01.233 --> 16:04.333
We kept it a secret for security,

16:04.567 --> 16:08.133
but from now on, every member in
the NSS Counter-terrorism Division

16:08.200 --> 16:10.500
will prepare for nuclear terror attack.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.700
Raise the security level to maximum,

16:12.767 --> 16:16.266
and any private contact
with the outside is prohibited.

16:16.333 --> 16:20.467
Until this situation is over,
we're on emergency alert.

16:20.533 --> 16:23.633
You must keep it a secret
from everyone including

16:24.100 --> 16:26.367
your family and other NSS departments.

16:29.166 --> 16:31.767
Mi-jeong, find out the cause of
the satellite server error and fix it.

16:31.834 --> 16:32.967
Okay.

16:33.333 --> 16:34.300
Sir,

16:35.433 --> 16:37.233
I have something to tell you.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.367
What is it?

16:44.834 --> 16:45.834
What is it?

16:46.700 --> 16:49.367
When I printed out the list
of asbestos factories,

16:49.433 --> 16:51.734
I gave it to Sa-woo.

16:52.567 --> 16:53.600
And?

16:54.066 --> 16:57.700
The most likely place we found

16:58.000 --> 16:59.600
was a storage in Seoksu, Anyang.

16:59.967 --> 17:01.133
What?

17:02.100 --> 17:03.967
Why was it excluded from the list?

17:04.066 --> 17:05.367
I also find it strange.

17:09.834 --> 17:10.767
Are you sure?

17:11.667 --> 17:12.600
I'm positive.

17:34.133 --> 17:35.166
Sir,

17:35.700 --> 17:37.633
I have something to tell you.

17:38.467 --> 17:40.200
Seung-hee Choi

17:41.300 --> 17:43.233
has been kidnapped by the terrorists.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.300
What are you talking about?

17:47.367 --> 17:48.533
Why her?

17:48.900 --> 17:50.033
I'm sorry.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.166
I should have stopped it from happening,

17:52.233 --> 17:53.433
but I didn't know.

17:57.667 --> 17:58.567
Okay.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.800
Let's go in.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.800
Basic issues regarding
the summit have been settled.

18:11.867 --> 18:16.533
North Korea's operating team
in charge of the camp during the summit

18:16.600 --> 18:18.233
is expected to arrive tomorrow.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.367
Mr. Gi-hoon Yeon,
who came here as an emissary,

18:20.433 --> 18:22.700
is the main delegate.

18:22.767 --> 18:25.166
Thank you, everyone.

18:25.233 --> 18:28.233
I still can't believe it'll happen.

18:28.400 --> 18:32.066
When you first suggested this summit,

18:32.266 --> 18:35.633
I honestly thought it'd be impossible.

18:35.700 --> 18:39.133
Now, I think reunification is
in the near future.

18:42.166 --> 18:45.934
I have something to tell you.

18:46.300 --> 18:49.233
When the NSS was recently attacked,

18:49.900 --> 18:52.567
there's something I didn't tell you.

18:52.633 --> 18:58.266
The terrorists stole an equipment
that the NSS was keeping.

18:59.767 --> 19:01.800
What is it?

19:03.800 --> 19:06.900
It's an ultra-precision detonator.

19:06.967 --> 19:09.066
Please explain.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.066
It's like a small nuclear bomb.

19:12.133 --> 19:16.133
How could you keep it a secret until now?

19:16.200 --> 19:18.433
I told him to.

19:18.600 --> 19:22.533
I couldn't announce it
until we confirmed the summit.

19:22.600 --> 19:27.133
We're at a risk of nuclear terrorism.
We must postpone the summit

19:27.200 --> 19:29.133
and declare the nation's
state of emergency.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.400
That's right.

19:30.467 --> 19:33.800
I will call the National Security Council,
immediately.

19:33.867 --> 19:35.600
We can't do that.

19:38.767 --> 19:41.433
Ever since I suggested the summit,

19:41.500 --> 19:44.834
I kept it a top secret
as I was worried that

19:44.934 --> 19:46.834
such an unfortunate event would occur.

19:46.967 --> 19:51.166
If we postpone the summit now,
we can't promise it'll ever happen.

19:52.033 --> 19:53.133
This is...

19:53.500 --> 19:55.667
what the opposing forces want.

19:56.066 --> 19:58.266
They want to prevent our reunification.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.867
I'll enforce the summit.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.734
Shouldn't we stop the nuclear terrorism?

20:08.100 --> 20:11.934
The NIS and special military forces
should work together--

20:12.000 --> 20:13.700
For the sake of security,

20:13.834 --> 20:15.533
we can't reveal it yet.

20:20.433 --> 20:21.467
The NSS

20:22.367 --> 20:24.667
will have to solve this issue.

20:42.867 --> 20:46.500
Cannot hide this loneliness

20:47.133 --> 20:51.300
With an empty heart alone

20:55.333 --> 20:58.233
There are only bruises left

20:59.166 --> 21:04.233
On my even more desolate appearance

21:05.467 --> 21:10.500
Before all my dreams

21:12.333 --> 21:17.333
Begin to disappear

21:17.600 --> 21:20.467
Protect me

21:20.900 --> 21:23.734
Please

21:23.934 --> 21:26.967
Pick me up now

21:27.567 --> 21:30.467
Please

21:30.934 --> 21:33.266
Don't let me go

21:34.200 --> 21:37.133
Don't leave me

21:37.367 --> 21:40.467
Don't turn away from me

22:07.033 --> 22:08.967
Have we met before?

22:22.700 --> 22:23.700
Hey.

22:23.767 --> 22:25.033
What are you thinking about?

22:26.066 --> 22:27.834
Nothing.

22:27.934 --> 22:30.967
If there's going to be
a nuclear terror attack in Seoul,

22:31.066 --> 22:33.166
shouldn't we tell our family?

22:33.333 --> 22:35.200
You don't have family in Seoul, do you?

22:38.367 --> 22:40.033
What's wrong with you today?

22:40.900 --> 22:41.900
Wait.

22:51.467 --> 22:52.567
It's me.

22:54.033 --> 22:56.967
When did you say you'll be in Seoul?

22:59.367 --> 23:00.467
I see.

23:00.767 --> 23:03.233
Can you not come on that day?

23:06.834 --> 23:07.700
Well,

23:07.767 --> 23:09.934
don't ask me why.

23:11.000 --> 23:11.867
Well,

23:12.467 --> 23:13.967
just don't come.

23:14.367 --> 23:16.633
If you come to Seoul, leave quickly.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.266
Okay? Promise me.

24:11.734 --> 24:12.767
What are you doing?

24:15.400 --> 24:18.000
I'm looking through
Seung-hee's personal computer.

24:40.867 --> 24:42.133
As soon as

24:42.200 --> 24:44.233
Hyun-jun finds out the security code,

24:45.433 --> 24:47.233
kill the woman.

24:48.567 --> 24:49.700
Okay, sir.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.700
I was a former SWAT agent
at the NSS.

25:12.467 --> 25:13.900
At the moment,

25:14.400 --> 25:15.633
I know very well

25:15.700 --> 25:18.166
the rules you must follow.

25:22.300 --> 25:25.500
You can predict how painful it will be

25:26.133 --> 25:27.767
to pay the price

25:29.133 --> 25:30.767
for following the rules
and remaining silent.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.734
You'll have to say it,

25:34.467 --> 25:36.533
so let's get it over with.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.300
What we need

25:41.967 --> 25:44.700
is the level one security code you have.

25:46.133 --> 25:48.233
If you were an NSS agent,

25:48.433 --> 25:50.400
you must know that

25:51.133 --> 25:54.233
the security code was destroyed
as soon as I went missing.

25:54.834 --> 25:56.066
I'll be the judge.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.166
Tell me what the security code is.

26:13.767 --> 26:15.834
Don't ever tell me the security code.

26:19.734 --> 26:21.166
As soon as you say it,

26:21.233 --> 26:22.400
you'll die.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.266
Look at this.

26:58.934 --> 26:59.867
Sun-hwa.

27:02.467 --> 27:03.433
Look at this.

27:08.700 --> 27:09.767
This is in Budapest

27:09.834 --> 27:12.333
when Comrade Chairman Seong-cheol Yun
was being escorted.

27:13.233 --> 27:14.467
Really?

27:49.800 --> 27:51.000
How is it going?

27:51.500 --> 27:54.467
We might spend the whole night
if we leave it up to him.

27:54.533 --> 27:55.900
Let me take care of it.

27:56.333 --> 27:57.533
I'll finish it soon.

27:58.266 --> 28:00.300
Inject the truth serum.

28:01.800 --> 28:02.867
Okay, sir.

28:05.533 --> 28:08.500
Captain, we found something
in her computer.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.700
If you keep buying time,

28:36.066 --> 28:37.567
we'll have to torture you.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.800
You were an NSS agent.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.567
Why did you become a terrorist?

28:46.300 --> 28:47.567
For what

28:48.900 --> 28:51.000
did you betray

28:53.200 --> 28:55.233
your colleagues, the NSS and South Korea?

28:58.834 --> 29:00.600
Remember that

29:00.934 --> 29:03.467
your choice can never be justified.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.700
Shut up and answer my question.

29:32.834 --> 29:33.967
What's the security code?

29:51.433 --> 29:52.700
Tell me.

29:54.867 --> 29:55.900
Tell me!

30:45.533 --> 30:46.834
What are you doing?

30:46.934 --> 30:49.667
I'm searching through other data.

30:56.867 --> 31:00.600
It's when Chairman Seong-cheol Yun
was assassinated in Hungary.

31:00.767 --> 31:02.767
Didn't you say

31:04.266 --> 31:06.500
Hyun-jun was also in Hungary?

31:08.734 --> 31:09.567
Yes.

31:12.734 --> 31:13.800
The two

31:13.867 --> 31:15.834
may know each other.

31:33.433 --> 31:34.467
What happened?

31:35.333 --> 31:36.533
She lost consciousness.

31:44.567 --> 31:47.266
I told you to interrogate her.
Are you going to kill her instead?

31:48.300 --> 31:49.333
Wake her up.

32:02.033 --> 32:03.066
Inject the drug.

32:07.066 --> 32:08.800
I'm almost done,
so give me a little more time.

32:08.867 --> 32:10.500
Wake her up now.

32:16.233 --> 32:19.500
All NSS agents passed
the truth serum test.

32:19.567 --> 32:20.633
That won't work on her.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.767
We'll find out

32:25.100 --> 32:26.834
whether she'll talk or not.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.266
Let go of me. Let go of me!

32:41.633 --> 32:43.767
Let go of me, let go of me!

33:45.266 --> 33:47.000
Ms. Choi

33:48.066 --> 33:50.266
has been kidnapped by the terrorists.

34:18.100 --> 34:19.433
It's me.

34:21.233 --> 34:24.200
Something unexpected has happened.

34:25.667 --> 34:27.367
You must not kill her.

34:27.433 --> 34:28.633
Right.

34:29.567 --> 34:30.500
Please...

34:31.600 --> 34:32.867
take care of it.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.133
Your name.

35:06.967 --> 35:08.266
Seung-hee Choi.

35:09.667 --> 35:10.800
Organization.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.667
The NSS.

35:15.100 --> 35:17.133
Counter-terrorism Team One.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.133
What's the NSS level one security code?

35:25.233 --> 35:26.266
It's...

35:31.367 --> 35:33.166
What's the NSS level one security code?

35:41.867 --> 35:42.734
Inject more

36:10.367 --> 36:12.967
NSS level one security code.

36:30.100 --> 36:30.934
Yes.

36:32.667 --> 36:33.533
Yes.

36:34.667 --> 36:36.600
We're interrogating her

36:36.667 --> 36:38.400
to get the NSS security code.

36:43.433 --> 36:44.367
Okay.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.834
Okay, sir.

36:49.333 --> 36:50.467
Who was it?

36:53.900 --> 36:54.934
Untie her.

36:55.533 --> 36:56.600
What?

36:57.633 --> 36:59.066
How's that possible?

36:59.567 --> 37:01.467
She killed Gyu-dong and Myeong-soo.

37:02.333 --> 37:03.400
How can you let her go?

37:03.467 --> 37:04.800
Shut up.

37:05.934 --> 37:06.967
Sun-hwa.

37:11.433 --> 37:13.767
Take him with you and let her go.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.834
Don't do anything stupid.

37:16.667 --> 37:17.967
Let her go.

37:19.100 --> 37:20.100
Okay, sir.

37:51.533 --> 37:53.166
I wonder who called.

37:53.767 --> 37:55.266
Can you guess

37:56.433 --> 37:57.934
why they let her go?

38:00.066 --> 38:01.200
No.

38:03.533 --> 38:04.500
Can you pull over?

38:06.467 --> 38:07.300
Why?

38:08.266 --> 38:09.333
Pull over.

38:23.367 --> 38:24.400
Go back first.

38:24.567 --> 38:25.500
What will you do?

38:25.867 --> 38:27.066
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

40:13.500 --> 40:14.800
Just as you worried,

40:18.200 --> 40:19.567
I became a monster.

40:26.767 --> 40:28.533
I can't go back to the way things were.

40:37.367 --> 40:38.367
Forget everything

40:43.567 --> 40:45.166
about me, Seung-hee.

41:58.900 --> 41:59.800
Seung-hee!

42:01.567 --> 42:03.300
Seung-hee, Seung-hee Choi,

42:05.033 --> 42:06.066
Seung-hee.

42:08.000 --> 42:08.900
Seung-hee!

42:48.934 --> 42:52.133
All the preparations for the summit
will take place here.

42:52.667 --> 42:53.800
Where are the South Koreans?

42:53.867 --> 42:57.133
The summit support camp of the Blue House
secretaries will be stationed downstairs.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.133
It's secure from wiretapping,

43:15.300 --> 43:17.033
so you can talk freely.

43:21.467 --> 43:22.700
If you give the order,

43:22.867 --> 43:25.166
we can use the nuclear bomb as a threat

43:25.233 --> 43:27.066
to stop the summit right now.

43:27.900 --> 43:29.033
That's not necessary.

43:30.367 --> 43:31.233
That nuclear bomb

43:33.433 --> 43:34.667
must explode in Seoul.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.967
That way, our warriors
will be known for their heroic act.

43:44.066 --> 43:45.567
Are you trying

43:45.633 --> 43:48.300
to declare a war against the South?

43:49.300 --> 43:50.166
That's right.

43:50.767 --> 43:52.700
Based on Operation Plan 5027,

43:52.767 --> 43:55.367
Americans will attack North Korea,

43:55.767 --> 43:58.600
which will fatally damage our republic.

43:58.834 --> 44:02.433
Once the UN Security Council
passes our request for arbitration,

44:05.767 --> 44:06.900
North and South

44:07.900 --> 44:09.567
will call for ceasefire again.

44:11.066 --> 44:12.300
Many people...

44:13.133 --> 44:15.100
will suffer more than they do now.

44:15.667 --> 44:16.567
Of course,

44:17.500 --> 44:18.567
some

44:19.533 --> 44:21.066
will be sacrificed.

44:24.066 --> 44:26.767
There's no hope
for Comrade Chairman's republic anymore.

44:27.133 --> 44:28.333
Through this war,

44:28.400 --> 44:30.233
I'll build a much younger

44:32.433 --> 44:34.367
and stronger republic.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.934
All the government and military delegates
have agreed with me.

44:41.166 --> 44:42.567
In building a new republic,

44:43.133 --> 44:45.367
you and I will play

44:45.533 --> 44:47.467
critical roles.

44:52.767 --> 44:55.433
I tried to stop the upcoming summit

44:56.000 --> 44:58.967
because this isn't
the reunification I wanted.

44:59.033 --> 45:00.967
The reunification I wanted

45:01.233 --> 45:04.834
wasn't something we get
by begging them on our knees.

45:05.300 --> 45:07.433
I didn't want to insult

45:07.967 --> 45:10.066
the people who endured difficult years

45:10.367 --> 45:12.533
only with their trust
in the Comrade Chairman

45:12.600 --> 45:14.700
and with their pride in our republic.

45:15.166 --> 45:16.433
I also believed

45:17.567 --> 45:20.266
the republic would regain power.

45:22.133 --> 45:23.200
I didn't know

45:24.734 --> 45:27.834
you were so idealistic.

45:49.133 --> 45:49.967
It's me.

45:50.066 --> 45:50.900
Yes.

45:50.967 --> 45:52.834
How is the nuclear fusion coming?

45:52.934 --> 45:54.467
It's in process as scheduled.

45:54.533 --> 45:55.533
As you ordered,

45:55.600 --> 45:57.533
the whole process is being videotaped.

45:57.600 --> 45:59.800
-Stop the fusion.
-Excuse me?

45:59.867 --> 46:02.500
Send the video to the NSS
and the Blue House.

46:02.700 --> 46:05.500
Declare a statement to stop the summit.

46:05.767 --> 46:08.133
This is enough to pressure South Korea.

46:08.200 --> 46:09.066
Stop it.

46:09.133 --> 46:10.400
I can't do that.

46:11.967 --> 46:13.700
What did you say?

46:13.834 --> 46:16.300
I said I can't follow that order.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.600
The order I received

46:18.700 --> 46:22.233
was to complete a nuclear bomb
and drop it in the center of Seoul.

46:22.300 --> 46:24.367
I never gave you such an order.

46:24.433 --> 46:26.266
Mr. Gi-hoon Yeon has

46:27.300 --> 46:29.667
the authority in this operation.

46:30.333 --> 46:31.633
I'm sorry, sir.

46:52.433 --> 46:53.533
Hyun-jun Kim.

46:54.300 --> 46:55.467
Do you know this woman?

46:56.900 --> 46:58.567
You said you were an NSS agent.

47:00.433 --> 47:02.333
Why did you become a terrorist?

47:03.367 --> 47:04.567
For what

47:06.033 --> 47:07.934
did you betray

47:08.900 --> 47:10.900
your colleagues, the NSS and South Korea?

47:15.133 --> 47:16.300
What's the security code?

47:27.400 --> 47:28.367
Tell me.

47:30.367 --> 47:31.500
Tell me!

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Don't ever tell me the security code.

47:48.033 --> 47:49.433
As soon as you say it,

47:49.500 --> 47:50.767
you'll die.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.166
Tell me.

47:57.300 --> 47:58.767
What happened to you?

48:26.967 --> 48:28.200
What are you doing alone?

48:28.266 --> 48:30.433
Sir, I was just...

48:30.500 --> 48:31.967
How's Seung-hee?

48:33.300 --> 48:34.567
The hospital released her.

48:35.166 --> 48:36.333
Don't worry so much.

48:37.333 --> 48:38.867
What happened to Seung-hee

48:39.300 --> 48:40.467
wasn't your fault.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.600
Tae-sung told me
that the final list he gave you

48:50.667 --> 48:53.633
included the storage in Seoksu.

48:54.300 --> 48:55.433
Weren't you aware of it?

48:57.500 --> 49:00.066
No, I wasn't aware of it.

49:03.100 --> 49:08.066
If what Tae-sung said is true,
it means someone fabricated the list.

49:08.467 --> 49:10.367
I think there's a traitor

49:11.667 --> 49:13.066
in the organization.

49:42.533 --> 49:43.567
How's Seung-hee?

49:44.066 --> 49:47.133
I believe she's released
from the hospital and resting at home.

49:47.433 --> 49:49.633
Unless there's an order,

49:50.033 --> 49:51.834
don't let her in the NSS.

49:51.900 --> 49:52.867
Okay, sir.

49:54.233 --> 49:56.500
There's something I'd like to say.

49:58.333 --> 49:59.300
I think...

50:00.100 --> 50:02.333
I think there's a spy in the NSS.

50:02.500 --> 50:03.567
What's the proof?

50:03.633 --> 50:05.834
The satellite server got disconnected

50:05.900 --> 50:08.300
at the time the terrorists fled.

50:08.567 --> 50:10.934
The likely location in which

50:11.133 --> 50:13.066
the terrorists were hiding

50:13.133 --> 50:15.233
had been omitted as well.

50:16.100 --> 50:17.900
Is there anyone you suspect?

50:18.300 --> 50:19.467
It's Sa-woo Jin.

50:24.100 --> 50:26.200
-Sa-woo Jin.
-Yes.

50:26.967 --> 50:28.333
What should I do?

50:33.033 --> 50:35.700
I'll order Internal Affairs
to look into it.

50:35.767 --> 50:37.133
Don't worry about it anymore.

50:38.033 --> 50:38.967
You may leave.

50:54.900 --> 50:56.900
Some in the NSS

50:57.233 --> 50:59.333
are suspicious of you.

51:00.200 --> 51:02.367
I can only protect you so much,

51:02.834 --> 51:04.266
so take care of yourself.

51:06.533 --> 51:07.433
Yes, sir.

51:13.900 --> 51:15.367
For the past 30 years,

51:16.333 --> 51:18.834
he's been fighting against the NSS.

51:19.166 --> 51:20.934
His name is Jeong-hoon Yoo.

51:21.667 --> 51:24.033
We call him Doctor.

51:24.700 --> 51:27.767
He's one of the nuclear physicists
who developed nuclear weapons

51:27.934 --> 51:30.033
under the rule of President Park.

51:30.200 --> 51:33.533
The NSS has used all possible means
to get rid of him,

51:33.600 --> 51:35.400
but we failed every time.

51:36.000 --> 51:36.867
However,

51:37.467 --> 51:41.033
I heard that Doctor is back in Korea.

51:41.633 --> 51:43.800
If it's true that he is,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.600
it's probably because of Hyun-jun.

51:47.600 --> 51:48.633
The only clue we have

51:50.000 --> 51:51.567
is that photo.

51:56.467 --> 51:58.033
Track him down.

52:42.266 --> 52:43.367
Do you want some ramen?

52:45.867 --> 52:46.767
Well,

52:47.934 --> 52:49.233
I'll take some coffee.

52:51.867 --> 52:53.233
Were you working?

52:53.734 --> 52:55.133
It's nothing important.

52:56.133 --> 52:58.166
I can do it for you
if it's on the computer.

52:58.333 --> 52:59.300
It's okay.

53:00.233 --> 53:02.533
I'm sorry about last time.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.433
I was really distressed then.

53:04.734 --> 53:08.433
I understood you when I heard
we lost eight people in the SWAT.

53:09.333 --> 53:10.900
Let me know if you need anything.

53:10.967 --> 53:12.500
Okay, thank you.

53:46.467 --> 53:48.834
Results of the analysis
will be out tomorrow. That's the earliest.

53:49.734 --> 53:51.266
That's not why I'm here.

53:51.734 --> 53:53.567
I was wondering if it's possible
to compare these

53:53.934 --> 53:55.734
on the physique analysis program.

54:00.900 --> 54:03.500
This is a photo from 30 years ago,

54:07.934 --> 54:09.967
and this is a recent photo.

54:22.233 --> 54:23.233
They're the same person.

54:25.533 --> 54:26.567
Who is he?

54:28.200 --> 54:30.166
It's nothing important.

54:30.934 --> 54:31.834
Thank you.

55:10.100 --> 55:11.000
Who are they?

55:11.500 --> 55:12.867
We have intruders.

55:13.133 --> 55:14.734
Intruders are in the parking lot.

57:06.734 --> 57:07.800
He's not answering.

57:10.233 --> 57:12.367
This has never happened
ever since I met him on the phone.

57:12.433 --> 57:13.567
I have a bad feeling.

57:14.400 --> 57:16.266
You don't know where he's hiding.

57:17.633 --> 57:19.500
First, I need to find out
where the nuclear bomb is.

58:01.734 --> 58:02.867
Don't leave a trace.

58:03.400 --> 58:04.266
Okay.

58:31.700 --> 58:33.467
I didn't expect

58:34.500 --> 58:36.133
you to be in this condition.

58:36.934 --> 58:38.033
You have also gotten

58:38.767 --> 58:39.867
quite old.

58:49.367 --> 58:50.700
Even when you've aged,

58:51.200 --> 58:52.767
you are still

58:53.667 --> 58:54.934
extremely cruel.

58:55.900 --> 58:59.400
That's the driving force
that brought me here today.

59:04.600 --> 59:05.734
I make sure

59:06.300 --> 59:07.633
I do things thoroughly.

59:14.200 --> 59:15.133
You were

59:15.867 --> 59:17.000
the only mistake

59:17.767 --> 59:19.734
in my life.

59:41.800 --> 59:42.734
Can you trace

59:43.000 --> 59:45.133
where this video is being
transmitted from?

1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:23.400
I got rid of everything.

1:00:42.667 --> 1:00:43.967
Don't think

1:00:44.667 --> 1:00:45.734
that this is the end.

1:00:47.767 --> 1:00:49.333
The person to finish the job

1:00:50.500 --> 1:00:51.867
wasn't going to be me anyway.

1:00:53.266 --> 1:00:55.900
Can you still say that
after what you've gone through?

1:00:56.967 --> 1:01:01.467
Whether it's a nation
or an individual like you,

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:05.266
no force against Iris has survived.

1:01:06.767 --> 1:01:07.667
If...

1:01:08.767 --> 1:01:11.200
you've got Hyun-jun in mind,

1:01:12.266 --> 1:01:13.767
you should forget about him.

1:01:15.066 --> 1:01:16.066
We're only

1:01:16.834 --> 1:01:18.967
keeping him alive because we need him.

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000
If I want to, I'll end him any time.

1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:28.867
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

1:01:32.467 --> 1:01:34.467
"Whoever sheds human blood,

1:01:35.633 --> 1:01:37.734
by humans shall their blood be shed."

1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:42.667
It's from the Genesis,
chapter nine, verse six.

1:01:44.867 --> 1:01:47.500
I'll keep that in mind.

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:17.333
No!

1:03:05.700 --> 1:03:07.166
As you wish.

1:03:17.367 --> 1:03:20.000
We haven't figured out
his whereabouts for six hours.

1:03:20.734 --> 1:03:23.700
I assassinated President Seong-cheol Yun.

1:03:23.967 --> 1:03:25.600
I think there's a traitor

1:03:25.667 --> 1:03:27.934
within the NSS.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.133
Who is it?

1:03:32.633 --> 1:03:33.934
Do you know him?

1:03:35.500 --> 1:03:36.800
Get rid of him before D-day.

1:03:40.166 --> 1:03:43.066
Shouldn't we get rid of Hyun-jun as well?

1:03:43.300 --> 1:03:44.567
Let me take care of it.
