WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:07.039
I've been
so distracted lately,

00:07.041 --> 00:08.774
mainly thinking
about my marriage and --

00:08.776 --> 00:10.843
And blah, blah, blah.
You'll never leave him.

00:10.845 --> 00:11.944
Now focus up, girl!

00:11.946 --> 00:13.012
You're right!

00:13.014 --> 00:14.480
It's foolish
to be talking at all

00:14.482 --> 00:16.648
when you bring out
one of your A-list personas.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.284
I mean, it's so rare
for<i> the</i> Samantha Kingsbury

00:19.286 --> 00:21.020
to make an appearance.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.789
Please, you sound just like
my ski instructor in St. Moritz.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.191
I don't know
if I can winter there again...

00:26.193 --> 00:28.994
Who is that?

00:28.996 --> 00:30.829
Her?
That's Meredith Fields.

00:30.831 --> 00:33.465
She's the most interesting
and fabulous woman

00:33.467 --> 00:35.034
in Langley Falls.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.302
She can't be all that
if I, Samantha Kingsbury,

00:37.304 --> 00:38.470
never heard of her.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.239
Meredith's
pretty amazing.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.574
She runs the best book club
in town.

00:42.576 --> 00:43.876
(scoffs)
Book club.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.744
I pretend skied
in Switzerland.

00:45.746 --> 00:48.680
And she runs a charity
to raise...

00:48.682 --> 00:49.982
Awareness.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.350
(scoffs)
Charities.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.485
It's all about podcasts
these days.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.921
She's even got time
for the homeless.

00:55.923 --> 00:58.323
Time?
I have sex with the homeless!

00:58.325 --> 01:01.326
Roger, she's married
to a dentist.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.394
(gasps)

01:05.099 --> 01:06.932
I can't believe
you haven't met her.

01:06.934 --> 01:10.569
Correction,<i> she</i> can't believe
she hasn't met<i> me.</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:12.571
Observe.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.006
Excuse me.

01:14.008 --> 01:15.374
Thank you.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.943
Oh, I just adore
the service here.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.946
Can I trouble you
for a glass of water?

01:34.462 --> 01:35.461
Thank you.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.096
Uh, before I order,

01:37.098 --> 01:39.398
you might want to get
that couple first.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.033
They were here
before me.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.953
Holy shit!

02:00.955 --> 02:04.456
She is amazing!

02:04.458 --> 02:05.924
She thought
I worked here.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.493
You kind of do.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.799
(patriotic music plays)

02:13.801 --> 02:16.668
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:16.670 --> 02:20.139
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

02:20.141 --> 02:23.142
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

02:23.144 --> 02:27.212
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

02:29.283 --> 02:32.951
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

02:32.953 --> 02:35.487
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:35.489 --> 02:36.922
Aah!

02:37.958 --> 02:40.926
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:43.664 --> 02:47.466
Whew! That CrossFit workout
was amazing.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.535
Coach Trey is awesome!

02:49.537 --> 02:52.004
Remember when he put
a protein bar against his crotch

02:52.006 --> 02:53.839
and pretended to jack off
all over the yoga class?

02:53.841 --> 02:54.973
So funny.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.943
Oh, CrossFit kicks
so much ass!

02:57.945 --> 02:59.845
Give it a rest, Klaus.
You're not a CrossFitter.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.313
Yeah, but I'm totally
gonna hit it

03:01.315 --> 03:02.614
when my shoulder
feels better.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.982
Sure, fish.

03:03.984 --> 03:07.019
Guys, check out my abs.
Jeff, hit me!

03:07.021 --> 03:08.787
Now me!
(gasps)

03:08.789 --> 03:10.289
Okay, plan --

03:10.291 --> 03:12.491
We hit it hard today,
so let's say we relax,

03:12.493 --> 03:14.626
grab some protein,
then hit the sack early

03:14.628 --> 03:16.461
so we can crush
tomorrow's workout.

03:16.463 --> 03:19.565
Oh, yeah.
I'm already hooked.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.968
I am in for
the swole enchilada.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.872
(all sigh)

03:26.874 --> 03:29.341
(gasps)

03:29.343 --> 03:30.242
No!

03:30.244 --> 03:31.176
No!

03:31.178 --> 03:32.311
No!

03:32.313 --> 03:33.745
Roger,
what are you doing?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.647
Samantha Kingsbury
may not have been

03:35.649 --> 03:37.349
as fabulous
as Meredith Fields,

03:37.351 --> 03:40.052
but there has to be a persona
in here that could beat her.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.554
PTA rock star
Mike Babcock --

03:42.556 --> 03:45.324
the cool dad every mom at school
wants to sleep with.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.858
I mean, bang.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.094
Nobody's sleeping
when Mike comes a-creeping.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.395
Nope.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.264
I'm just gonna have to start
from scratch.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.465
Come on,
you'll drive.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.235
Where are we?

03:56.237 --> 03:57.736
Now you're asking?

03:57.738 --> 04:00.539
You're a real odd duck,
Francine.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.008
Anyway, this is my magical
persona factory.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.778
Oh, my God!

04:06.780 --> 04:10.282
Funny you mention him.
This is where he was created.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.017
Or, rather, she.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.353
No, he.
God's a he.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.988
And he's white.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.895
FRANCINE:
Roger, I have to ask...

04:23.897 --> 04:24.930
(bleats)

04:24.932 --> 04:26.765
What is your
electric bill?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.066
Don't worry about it.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.768
(electricity crackling)

04:32.106 --> 04:34.640
All my characters
are conceived here.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.643
I'm sure you recognize
some of my best work.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.646
And now, my best work
needs to be better!

04:40.648 --> 04:44.149
Like a chef, I must pick
the finest ingredients.

04:44.151 --> 04:48.086
All my work has led me
to this moment...

04:48.088 --> 04:52.224
The most fabulous person
I've ever birthed.

04:52.226 --> 04:55.294
And dry ice
for effect.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.663
Get ready to meet...

04:57.665 --> 04:59.231
Raider Dave!

04:59.233 --> 05:00.499
Oh, overcooked it.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.668
Boy, you add
just one ingredient too many,

05:02.670 --> 05:04.436
and you end up
Raider Dave --

05:04.438 --> 05:05.671
every time.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.677
All right,
time for the morning work--

05:11.679 --> 05:13.111
Ouch!

05:13.113 --> 05:15.480
My body --
it's dead!

05:15.482 --> 05:18.617
Oh, my God!
Why can't I move?!

05:18.619 --> 05:21.119
It must be
from CrossFit.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.254
Jeff?!

05:22.256 --> 05:24.156
Down here.
I'm stuck, too.

05:24.158 --> 05:26.024
Do I hear
that correctly?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.292
(glass shatters)

05:27.294 --> 05:31.263
The entire family
is unable to move?

05:31.265 --> 05:33.365
Klaus, thank God!
Help us!

05:33.367 --> 05:37.102
Oh, no.
Klaus is in charge now.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.438
I can finally
have that birthday party

05:39.440 --> 05:41.807
you didn't let me have
two years ago.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.475
We never stopped you from --

05:43.477 --> 05:45.811
Yes! The party!

05:45.813 --> 05:48.513
It'll be my party,

05:48.515 --> 05:50.649
with my favorite food.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.451
My favorite drink.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.520
And everybody's
favorite song!

05:55.522 --> 05:57.155
No! Klaus!

05:57.157 --> 05:59.157
¶ I like to move it, move it ¶

05:59.159 --> 06:01.226
¶ I like to move it, move it ¶
My ears!

06:01.228 --> 06:02.461
¶ I like to move it, move it ¶
It burns!

06:02.463 --> 06:03.729
(music stops)

06:03.731 --> 06:06.331
Oh, I can't do this
to you guys...

06:06.333 --> 06:08.734
without Jacking
that bass!

06:08.736 --> 06:10.502
¶ ...Move it, move it ¶
(all screaming)

06:10.504 --> 06:12.137
¶ I like to move it, move it ¶

06:12.139 --> 06:14.039
¶ Ya like to move it ¶

06:14.041 --> 06:16.541
(classical music playing)

06:16.543 --> 06:19.344
Let's thank Sandra
for her choice this month.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.413
<i> Little Women</i>
was just a delight.

06:21.415 --> 06:24.549
By the end, after all
Jo and the girls went through,

06:24.551 --> 06:26.485
it should called
<i> Big Women.</i>

06:26.487 --> 06:29.721
Big women?
Try huge.

06:32.426 --> 06:33.825
Mm.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.560
Cecilia Takaru's
the name.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.330
Born on a sleigh ride
outside St. Petersburg.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.065
Closer to Tampa,
actually.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.234
Or as us Tampons
like to call it,

06:42.236 --> 06:44.269
-home of Hulk Hogan.
(laughter)

06:44.271 --> 06:46.037
-My goodness.
-What a gas.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.407
Studied literature
at Space Camp for four years,

06:48.409 --> 06:50.342
which, naturally,
led me to franchise

06:50.344 --> 06:51.910
the Chimdale Ikea.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.247
Not a stress-free job,
but I have a handle on it.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.116
Sorry, I blacked out.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.018
Oh, yeah,
<i> Little Women.</i>

07:00.020 --> 07:01.787
Alcott called it
<i> Little Women</i>

07:01.789 --> 07:04.589
because she was challenging
the male-centric<i> Huck Finn</i>

07:04.591 --> 07:07.359
and the role of females
in a post-colonial America.

07:07.361 --> 07:09.361
Wow.
Welcome, Cecilia.

07:09.363 --> 07:13.031
I'm not familiar
with the Space Camp curriculum,

07:13.033 --> 07:14.533
but wasn't<i> Little Women</i>

07:14.535 --> 07:17.235
published 20 years
before<i> Huck Finn?</i>

07:17.237 --> 07:19.137
(gulps)

07:19.139 --> 07:22.774
In -- in space,
time is very fluid.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.310
As Einstein hypothesized,

07:25.312 --> 07:27.045
stuff from earlier...

07:27.047 --> 07:30.549
might actually be
from later.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.883
Pull it together.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.553
Einstein's theory
of relativity.

07:34.555 --> 07:38.890
And to come up with that
riding a Strassenbahn in Vienna.

07:38.892 --> 07:44.095
I'd say it was a greater leap
for mankind than the moonwalk.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.163
(retches)

07:45.165 --> 07:47.632
(tires squeal)

07:50.137 --> 07:52.170
Roger,
what are you doing?

07:52.172 --> 07:54.139
Cecilia Takaru
is a lie!

07:54.141 --> 07:56.475
All of these personas
are lies!

07:56.477 --> 07:58.176
Well, yeah.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.511
Masks!

07:59.513 --> 08:01.480
They cover up the fact
that I'm empty inside!

08:01.482 --> 08:02.914
Roger, that's not true!

08:02.916 --> 08:05.083
It took meeting someone
as real as Meredith

08:05.085 --> 08:06.785
for me to see
I'm like an onion.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.955
When you peel away the layers,
there's nothing left --

08:09.957 --> 08:11.289
except tears!

08:11.291 --> 08:12.357
(sobbing)

08:15.596 --> 08:16.595
Aah!

08:16.597 --> 08:19.197
What are you doing?!
No!

08:21.201 --> 08:23.768
Die! All of you!

08:23.770 --> 08:26.004
This is agony!

08:26.006 --> 08:28.173
I programmed them
to feel burning.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.709
Back to crazy!
Aah!

08:31.712 --> 08:33.778
(screaming)

08:36.850 --> 08:38.483
Why would you do this?

08:38.485 --> 08:40.619
That was
your life's work!

08:40.621 --> 08:42.020
That life is over.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.822
I'm done
creating characters!

08:43.824 --> 08:45.857
I'm gonna live
the rest of my days

08:45.859 --> 08:48.460
as the most boring person
on the planet...

08:48.462 --> 08:49.794
me.

08:49.796 --> 08:52.130
Well, you have to
put on something.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.133
I can't drive you around
looking like an alien.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.335
Fine!

08:57.337 --> 08:59.304
Drive.
Take me nowhere.

08:59.306 --> 09:02.073
It's the only place
a nobody belongs.

09:02.075 --> 09:05.210
(sobbing)

09:05.212 --> 09:06.645
(car door opens, closes)

09:06.647 --> 09:08.980
(sirens wailing)

09:08.982 --> 09:11.883
(explosion, glass shatters)

09:16.590 --> 09:19.357
(Roger sobbing)

09:19.359 --> 09:22.027
Oh, Roger, I can hear you
sobbing in there,

09:22.029 --> 09:23.895
and it's breaking
my heart.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.196
(crinkling)

09:25.198 --> 09:26.898
I also hear you
rubbing on stuff,

09:26.900 --> 09:28.366
probably our groceries.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.201
ROGER: Probably.

09:30.203 --> 09:33.271
Just put on the emergency poncho
and come sit up front with me.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.843
Formless and generic --
just like me.

09:38.845 --> 09:41.513
Well, we can zhuzh it up
a little.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.885
Much better.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.254
But you need
some hair.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.090
Pretty.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.526
Ugh.

09:54.528 --> 09:55.961
(car door closes)

09:55.963 --> 09:59.664
I just know he did
something terrible to this.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.701
(car door closes)

10:08.809 --> 10:10.308
(all squawk)

10:17.551 --> 10:19.384
Come on, Tony,
pick up, pick up.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.586
You've been calling people
all afternoon.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.989
Face it, Klaus,
no one's coming to your party.

10:23.991 --> 10:27.125
Trust me, my boy Tony
always comes through.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.494
Hey, Tony!
It's Klaus!

10:29.496 --> 10:31.630
Get your ass over here.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.499
There is a par-tay
going on!

10:34.501 --> 10:37.669
Yeah, of course
I'll give you the the deets.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.671
See?
He wants the deets.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.106
Okay, usual deets.

10:41.108 --> 10:44.075
Personal pepperoni
and small crazy bread.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.577
45 minutes!

10:45.579 --> 10:48.580
Oh, he can't wait to party!

10:48.582 --> 10:51.182
That's Tony, bro!

10:53.754 --> 10:56.187
I got a double
half-caff cappuccino,

10:56.189 --> 10:57.422
extra whip for...

10:57.424 --> 10:59.190
Wait a second,
there's no name.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.660
That's me.
I don't deserve a name.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.028
Gah! This is awful!

11:03.030 --> 11:05.764
Do you know who I am?
Make it again...

11:05.766 --> 11:06.931
for no name.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.000
Why don't you just go
by Roger?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.502
There is no Roger.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.637
Roger is just a collection
of phony persona's

11:12.639 --> 11:14.606
to cover up
an emptiness inside.

11:14.608 --> 11:15.874
You're not empty inside.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.709
You've just forgotten
who you are

11:17.711 --> 11:20.311
'cause you spend so much time
being other people.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.281
So what's a person do when
they've forgotten who they are?

11:23.283 --> 11:24.783
You could...

11:24.785 --> 11:26.484
volunteer
for something.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.953
They say the best way
to find yourself

11:28.955 --> 11:30.855
is in the service
of others.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.123
"Awareness.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.892
A-where's yours?"

11:33.894 --> 11:35.326
(chuckles)
That's clever.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.728
This speaks to me.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.164
That's the flier
for Meredith's charity gala.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.566
I don't think
you should be around the woman

11:41.568 --> 11:43.835
who's got you wearing a mop
on your head.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.870
She's exactly
who I should be around,

11:45.872 --> 11:47.839
'cause she knows
exactly who she is.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.541
Ooh,
phone jack installation.

11:49.543 --> 11:52.043
This guy sounds like he knows
who he is as well.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.212
Hmm, so it's down
to these two.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.647
Piano lessons?!

11:55.649 --> 11:58.016
Wait, don't park
in the CVS parking lot?

11:58.018 --> 12:00.819
This board is just knocking
my socks off!

12:03.390 --> 12:04.556
Okay, so...

12:04.558 --> 12:06.925
you take
your water bottle, okay,

12:06.927 --> 12:09.427
and you just slide
the label on.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.996
There.
You just raised awareness.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.065
I think I felt it.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.701
Oh.
Your bungee cord belt.

12:16.703 --> 12:17.669
(groans)

12:17.671 --> 12:20.038
Look at your
neat belt!

12:20.040 --> 12:22.073
Seems to have traveled
on you.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.174
Thank you!

12:23.176 --> 12:24.909
And thank you
for your help.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.878
Awareness
is the first step

12:26.880 --> 12:30.215
before thinking about caring
about a specific thing.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.117
You crawl
before you walk.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.518
Walk before you run.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.286
Pee before you sex!

12:35.288 --> 12:38.089
(laughs)
Someone's got spunk!

12:38.091 --> 12:40.725
You're gonna do
just fine.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.293
(laughs) Oh!

12:42.295 --> 12:44.362
That means so much coming
from someone like you.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.931
Sometimes, I don't have
a lot of confidence.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.534
Don't be silly.
You can be whoever you want.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.902
You're so kind.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.004
May I give you something?

12:54.307 --> 12:57.208
Well,
what do we have here?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.343
Triangle.

13:01.114 --> 13:05.316
Now, isn't that a curious way
to look at someone.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.819
(Reel 2 Real's
"I Like to Move It" playing)

13:07.821 --> 13:09.988
Why didn't the pizza guy
help us?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.923
'Cause Klaus
didn't tip him.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.091
An apple is a tip.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.225
(doorbell rings)

13:14.227 --> 13:16.327
Thank God, somebody's here!
Help!

13:16.329 --> 13:17.629
Yeah, party people!

13:17.631 --> 13:19.798
Help yourselves
to some pizza.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.833
If anyone knows
how to make Jell-O shots,

13:21.835 --> 13:23.468
there's a half handle
of Popov.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.336
Klaus, who the hell
are these people?

13:25.338 --> 13:28.239
Oh, just some people I know
through my friend Craig.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.508
You might know him.
He has his own list.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.778
You invited perverts
from Craigslist into my house?

13:33.780 --> 13:35.780
¶ I like to move it, move it ¶

13:35.782 --> 13:37.415

thing here, Jeff.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.322
¶ Ya like to move it ¶

13:44.324 --> 13:46.291
What's happening?!
Something's wet!

13:46.293 --> 13:49.327
Oh, God!
Something's wet!

13:49.329 --> 13:52.263
Nice to see you smiling again
and not starting fires.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.299
Did you do something
to your hair?

13:54.301 --> 13:56.267
It looks like
Meredith's, right?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.236
She says I can be
just like her.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.174
Don't forget --

14:03.176 --> 14:05.476
You're supposed to be finding
yourself!

14:05.478 --> 14:06.811
Yeah, yeah.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.513
Meredith! Meredith!

14:08.515 --> 14:10.682
Meredith!
Meredith, hi!

14:10.684 --> 14:12.483
Oh.
Oh, it's you.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.718
Is that my scarf?

14:13.720 --> 14:15.653
Did you change
your hair?

14:15.655 --> 14:16.888
I don't think so.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.122
Do you like it?!

14:18.124 --> 14:19.891
I have the same haircut.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.793
Uh, Mer, I've got
the band leader on the phone.

14:21.795 --> 14:23.895
I wrote some songs about
awareness. You want to hear 'em?

14:23.897 --> 14:26.164
You're probably already thinking
'em 'cause we're so similar.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.165
Oh, my God, that's so us!

14:27.167 --> 14:28.666
-Meredith?
-Yes?

14:28.668 --> 14:30.368
Yes? I mean -- I mean,
why are you asking me?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.904
I'm not Meredith.
We have to move up
the news plug.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.206
Did you think I was Meredith?
Do I look like Meredith?
They need you on the air
in five.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.808
Meredith, we've got
big banner problems.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.209
Not now.
I'm in the middle of something.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.545
Please,
can you give us some space?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.914
Yes, can you all
give us some space?

14:42.916 --> 14:44.148
Oh, right, sure.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.351
I'll -- I'll just go
busy myself...

14:46.353 --> 14:49.087
in<i> our</i> trash.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.723
That Dumpster's got to be
around here somewhere.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.192
Oh! Maybe it's in Meredith's
master bedroom.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.760
I'll just take a quick peek.

15:00.767 --> 15:01.833
(smooches)

15:06.773 --> 15:08.339
What are you doing?!

15:08.341 --> 15:09.340
Mer-Mer?

15:09.342 --> 15:10.541
Is that my negligee?

15:10.543 --> 15:11.542
I'm so sorry.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.011
I just admire you so much,

15:13.013 --> 15:15.013
and I saw it,
and -- and -- and --

15:15.015 --> 15:16.681
Oh, promise me
you're not mad!

15:16.683 --> 15:18.116
What?!
I'm extremely mad!

15:18.118 --> 15:19.784
We don't even
know each other.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.753
-I mean, what's your name?
-Meredith.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.121
But that's my name.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.422
I know!

15:24.424 --> 15:26.124
You told me I could be
whoever I want.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.191
And I chose you.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.359
But I'm me.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.028
Mm, sorry.
You're already taken.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.629
I'd like you
to leave right now.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.564
And I'd like you
to give me your pants,

15:33.566 --> 15:35.600
because we're so obviously
the same size.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.101
Why are you acting
like this?

15:37.103 --> 15:38.770
Gee, I don't know,
Meredith two.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.306
Maybe it's because
I'm standing here

15:41.308 --> 15:43.574
in my delicates
like a crazy person!

15:43.576 --> 15:44.776
(grunting)

15:44.778 --> 15:47.478
Oh, my God!
She's out cold!

15:47.480 --> 15:49.614
What have I done?
What do I do?

15:49.616 --> 15:52.250
What would Meredith do?

15:52.252 --> 15:53.618
Of course.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.854
The answer's
right in front of me.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.733
(doorbell rings)

16:08.735 --> 16:09.901
Why, hello there!

16:09.903 --> 16:11.402
Sorry to bother,

16:11.404 --> 16:13.671
but I'm looking
for one of your volunteers.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.807
She didn't come home
last night.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.842
ROGER (as Meredith):
Who's at the door, dear?

16:17.844 --> 16:18.910
Oh, no.

16:18.912 --> 16:21.646
Well,
I'll leave you two.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.649
I'm gonna go
brush my teeth.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.852
Small circles,
light pressure.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.487
(both moaning)

16:34.627 --> 16:36.928
Roger, what the hell
did you do?

16:36.930 --> 16:38.196
Where's Meredith?!

16:38.198 --> 16:40.498
Francine,
everything's fine now.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.134
I put her on a barge,
and now I'm her.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.535
A barge?

16:44.537 --> 16:46.637
You can't take
someone's life like this!

16:46.639 --> 16:48.973
Why? Can't it just be like
when we were kids?

16:48.975 --> 16:50.641
Oh, Franny,
we'd draw pictures

16:50.643 --> 16:53.311
with red oceans and green skies
and be who we wanted!

16:53.313 --> 16:55.013
And then play
in the sprinklers

16:55.015 --> 16:56.714
till Mama called us
for supper.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.283
Are you having a stroke
right now?

16:59.285 --> 17:01.519
Forget it.
I'm stopping this.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.221
That's barge talk,
Francine.

17:03.223 --> 17:06.157
Roger, I am not going
to sit here and --

(fog horn blares)

He barged me.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.667
Meredith,
are you okay?

17:16.669 --> 17:19.670
Some lunatic kidnapped me
and dumped me here.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.372
Yeah, that's my friend.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.876

She's running your gala.

17:24.878 --> 17:30.014
Oh, and she may be having
relations with your husband.

this party.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.922

have become emboldened.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.224
You've proven your point.
You have a crew, okay?

17:40.226 --> 17:41.759
Now stop this!

I don't know what's happening,
but I think I'm moving!

please.

we were in trouble?

18:15.128 --> 18:17.295
After you didn't show up
for your second workout,

18:17.297 --> 18:19.297
I figured something like this
had happened.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.865
A lot of first-time
CrossFitters

they can't move.

It's the roofie
of physical fitness.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.736
You should tell people that
when they sign up.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.138
Hey, no problem.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.607

As a terrible
marine biologist.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.500
Get him!

19:29.502 --> 19:31.769
(sirens wailing)

19:36.442 --> 19:38.709
Maniacs!

19:43.349 --> 19:45.383
Hold it right there,
imposter!

19:45.385 --> 19:47.418
I'm not the imposter!
She is!

19:54.360 --> 19:56.027
Hey!

20:00.667 --> 20:01.799
(sighs)

20:01.801 --> 20:03.467
Back to being nobody,
I guess.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.870
Oh, hey, Franny.
How was the barge?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.004
Honestly...

20:07.006 --> 20:08.239
pretty great.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.707
Listen, I'm sorry.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.343
I know I went too far,
but being Meredith,

20:12.345 --> 20:15.012
it just felt so good
to be someone real.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.415
But you were nothing
like Meredith.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.483
I didn't even
do<i> that</i> right.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.985
You were you.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.688
You're always you,
no matter who you're playing.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.156
'Cause the real Roger

20:25.158 --> 20:27.825
is at the core
of all your characters.

20:27.827 --> 20:31.262
You are real selfish
and real horny

20:31.264 --> 20:34.832
and real violent
and real sensitive.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.101
And just really...

20:37.103 --> 20:39.070
Really amazing.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.338
Do you mean it?

20:40.340 --> 20:42.506
Do you honestly
think I'm horny?

20:42.508 --> 20:45.343
The horniest.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.544
Thank you, Franny.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.746
You're not so
not horny yourself.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.081
Where's the criminal?

20:50.083 --> 20:51.616
He's not a criminal.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.185
Unless it's a crime
to bleed silver and black.

20:54.187 --> 20:55.753
Raider Dave!

20:55.755 --> 20:58.956
This is our year!
Raider Nation will rise again!

20:58.958 --> 21:02.193
(whooping)

21:02.195 --> 21:04.161
Bye-bye! See you soon!
