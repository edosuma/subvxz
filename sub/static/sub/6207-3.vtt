00:04.212 --> 00:07.340
You think I'll look at a demon
and suddenly fall off the wagon...

00:07.507 --> 00:10.134
...as if after everything,
I haven't learned my lesson.

00:10.301 --> 00:11.594
Well, have you?

00:11.802 --> 00:13.596
This is my girlfriend, Jessica.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.515
No! Jess!

00:15.681 --> 00:18.768
What are you gonna do,
just live some normal apple-pie life?

00:18.935 --> 00:20.311
Not normal. Safe.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.271
- I'm a vessel?
- You're the vessel.

00:22.438 --> 00:24.232
- Michael's vessel.
- The answer's no.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.943
- Where's Cass?
- Archangel smote the crap out of him.

00:27.109 --> 00:30.363
- How are you...?
- Alive? It's a good question.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.907
I just wish I could save people
like I used to.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.368
When you were all hopped up
on demon blood?

00:35.576 --> 00:38.663
Your plan to kill Lucifer, it's foolish.
It can't be done.

00:38.829 --> 00:40.039
I have the solution.

00:40.248 --> 00:43.334
- I'm gonna find God.
- Try New Mexico. I hear he's on a tortilla.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.753
I killed two angels this week.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.549
I rebelled and I did it, all of it, for you.
And you failed.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.259
I'm in no shape to be hunting.

00:51.425 --> 00:53.594
Maybe it's best
we just go our separate ways.

00:53.761 --> 00:56.013
Well, I think you're right.

01:16.909 --> 01:18.578
Hey, baby.

01:20.037 --> 01:21.330
I missed you.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.042
Jessica.

01:25.918 --> 01:27.712
I'm dreaming.

01:28.796 --> 01:30.548
Or you're not.

01:31.215 --> 01:33.009
What's the difference? I'm here.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.975
I miss you so much.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.768
I know.

01:44.645 --> 01:46.522
I miss you too.

01:48.941 --> 01:51.235
What are you doing, Sam?

01:53.779 --> 01:56.616
- What do you mean?
- Running away.

01:57.241 --> 01:59.869
- Haven't we been down this road before?
- No.

02:00.745 --> 02:03.122
- It's different now.
- Really?

02:04.290 --> 02:07.168
Last time I wanted to be normal.

02:07.376 --> 02:11.672
This time I know I'm a freak.

02:12.006 --> 02:15.176
Which is all a big ball of semantics.

02:15.343 --> 02:16.594
- You know that.
- No.

02:16.761 --> 02:19.388
Even at Stanford, you knew.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.517
You knew there was something dark
inside of you.

02:22.808 --> 02:25.478
Deep down, maybe, but you knew.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.814
Baby, that's what got me killed.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.319
- No.
- I was dead the moment we said hello.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.697
- No.
- Don't you get it?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.991
You can't run from yourself.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.536
Why are you running now?

02:41.702 --> 02:43.913
Why are you here, Jess?

02:44.080 --> 02:46.707
Would you believe
I'm actually trying to protect you?

02:46.874 --> 02:48.960
- From what?
- You.

02:50.002 --> 02:54.131
Sooner or later the past is gonna
catch up to you like it always does.

02:54.298 --> 02:56.133
You know what happens then?

02:57.176 --> 02:59.220
People die.

03:00.137 --> 03:02.390
Baby, the people closest to you die.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.852
Well, don't worry, because
I won't make that mistake again.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.229
Same song, different verse.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.942
Things are never gonna change
with you.

03:13.776 --> 03:14.819
Never.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.980
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.930
- Hi. I'm Detective Bill Buckner.
- Yes.

04:24.096 --> 04:26.682
- How can I help you?
- I'm here about those patients.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.351
The exsanguinated ones.

04:41.989 --> 04:43.115
Eat it, Twilight.

05:20.236 --> 05:24.323
<i>There is someone up above</i>

05:25.366 --> 05:32.290
<i>And be a simple kind of man</i>

05:33.166 --> 05:36.794
<i>Oh, won't you do this for me, son</i>

05:36.961 --> 05:38.880
<i>If you can?</i>

05:40.506 --> 05:43.843
<i>Baby, be a simple</i>

05:44.552 --> 05:46.762
<i>Be a simple man</i>

05:58.441 --> 06:00.026
God!

06:00.860 --> 06:02.945
Don't do that.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.948
Hello, Dean.

06:09.785 --> 06:13.331
Cass, we've talked about this.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.625
Personal space.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.336
My apologies.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.217
How did you find me? I thought
I was flying below the angel radar.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.135
You are.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.055
Bobby told me where you were.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.975
Where's Sam?

06:36.854 --> 06:40.441
Me and Sam are taking
separate vacations for a while.

06:41.817 --> 06:46.697
Did you find God yet? More importantly,
can I have my damn necklace back?

06:46.864 --> 06:50.368
No, I haven't found him.
That's why I'm here. I need your help.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.620
With what, God hunt?

06:52.787 --> 06:55.289
- Not interested.
- It's not God. It's someone else.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.876
Who?

06:59.043 --> 07:02.588
It's an archangel.
The one who killed me.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.175
- Excuse me?
- His name is Raphael.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.221
You were wasted
by a Teenage Mutant Ninja Angel?

07:10.388 --> 07:13.850
I've heard whispers
that he's walking the earth.

07:14.016 --> 07:17.311
- This is a rare opportunity.
- For what, revenge?

07:17.478 --> 07:18.521
Information.

07:19.355 --> 07:23.234
So you think if you find this dude,
he's just gonna spill God's address?

07:23.401 --> 07:24.610
Yes.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.196
Because we are gonna trap him
and interrogate him.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.994
You're serious about this.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.664
Yes.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.585
So, what,
I'm Thelma and you're Louise...

07:40.751 --> 07:44.130
...and we're just gonna hold hands
and sail off this cliff together?

07:49.760 --> 07:52.513
Give me one good reason
why I should do this.

07:53.264 --> 07:57.310
Because you're Michael's vessel
and no angel will dare harm you.

07:57.476 --> 07:59.562
Oh, so I'm your bullet shield.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.773
I need your help...

08:03.774 --> 08:09.488
...because you are the only one
who'll help me.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.242
Please.

08:18.789 --> 08:19.999
All right, fine.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.920
- Where is he?
- Maine.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.213
- Let's go.
- Whoa, whoa.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.883
- What?
- Last time you zapped me someplace...

08:29.050 --> 08:30.718
...I didn't poop for a week.

08:32.678 --> 08:33.763
We're driving.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.265
Hey, Keith, you play?

08:36.432 --> 08:37.808
That depends.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.644
What are we playing for?

08:40.602 --> 08:41.645
World peace.

08:43.563 --> 08:45.274
Oh, is that all?

08:45.691 --> 08:47.443
Can I ask you something?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.028
Shoot.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.156
You finish that crossword puzzle
in the kitchen?

08:52.615 --> 08:55.034
Uh, I guess. Why?

08:55.201 --> 08:58.287
<i>The New York Times
Saturday crossword?</i>

08:59.747 --> 09:02.208
- Was it?
- Uh-huh.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.378
You blow into town last week,
you don't talk to anybody.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.047
You're obviously highly educated.
You're like this...

09:08.214 --> 09:11.384
Riddle wrapped inside an enigma
wrapped inside a taco?

09:12.468 --> 09:13.678
Here's what we play for:

09:14.679 --> 09:17.849
When I win, you buy me dinner
and tell me your life story.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.936
Sounds fair.

09:31.863 --> 09:32.905
<i>Very misterioso.</i>

09:33.072 --> 09:35.241
<i>Freak hail, lightning strikes, now fire...</i>

09:35.408 --> 09:38.160
<i>...is hitting the town of Hawley tonight.
- I like it.</i>

09:38.327 --> 09:41.289
<i>Locals say what started
as a hailstorm late this afternoon...</i>

09:41.455 --> 09:43.875
<i>...suddenly turned
to massive lightning strikes.</i>

09:44.041 --> 09:46.961
<i>That triggered the fire
now consuming more than 20 acres...</i>

09:47.128 --> 09:48.671
<i>...along the Route 17 corridor.</i>

09:48.838 --> 09:51.340
<i>County officials are advising
all Hawley residents...</i>

09:51.549 --> 09:54.802
<i>...to prepare for what could become
mandatory evacuations.</i>

09:55.386 --> 09:56.762
Damn.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.141
Is it me or does it seem like
the end of the world?

10:04.979 --> 10:06.772
We're here why?

10:08.149 --> 10:10.234
A deputy sheriff laid eyes
on the archangel.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.904
And he still has eyes?

10:13.988 --> 10:15.198
All right, what's the plan?

10:16.282 --> 10:20.494
We'll tell the officer that he witnessed
an angel of the Lord.

10:21.370 --> 10:24.415
Then the officer will tell us
where the angel is.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.918
Serious? Gonna walk in there,
tell him the truth?

10:27.084 --> 10:28.628
- Why not?
- Because...

10:29.587 --> 10:30.713
...we're humans.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.591
And when humans want something...

10:33.925 --> 10:36.260
...really, really bad...

10:37.136 --> 10:38.179
...we lie.

10:39.555 --> 10:40.681
Why?

10:40.848 --> 10:44.477
Because that's how you become
president.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.272
Deputy Framingham?

10:49.398 --> 10:50.441
Hi.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.111
Alonzo Mosely, FBI.
This is my partner, Eddie Moscone.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.823
Also FBI.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.792
He's, uh... He's new.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.921
- Mind if we ask you a few questions?
- Yeah, sure. Talk here, though.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.174
Hearing's all blown to hell in this one.

11:15.758 --> 11:19.762
- That happen recently?
- Yeah. Gas station thing.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.014
Why you're here, isn't it?

11:22.932 --> 11:24.517
Yes, it is. Ahem.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.980
You mind just running us through
what happened?

11:30.273 --> 11:33.651
A call came in, disturbance
out at the Pump 'n Go on Route 4.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.821
- What kind of disturbance?
- Would not have believed my eyes...

11:36.988 --> 11:40.741
...if I hadn't seen it myself.
We're talking a riot. Full-scale.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.910
- How many?
- Thirty, 40.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.746
In all-out, kill-or-be-killed combat.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.665
Any idea what set them off?

11:48.207 --> 11:50.376
It's angels and demons, probably.

11:50.918 --> 11:54.255
- They're skirmishing all over the globe.
- Come again? What did he say?

11:54.422 --> 11:55.464
- Nothing.
- Demons.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.383
- Nothing.
- Demons.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.386
Demons. You know, drink, adultery.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.556
We all have our demons, Walt. Right?

12:05.016 --> 12:06.517
I guess.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.562
Anyway, what happened next?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.314
Freaking explosion, that's what.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.358
Oh, they said it was one
of those underground gas tanks...

12:14.525 --> 12:16.903
...but I don't think so.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.614
- Why not?
- It wasn't your usual fireball.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.490
- It was...
- Pure white.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.827
Yeah.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.663
Gas station was leveled.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.082
Everyone was...

12:30.291 --> 12:32.335
It was just horrible.

12:33.336 --> 12:36.005
Then I see this one guy,
kneeling there...

12:37.048 --> 12:38.716
...real focused-like.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.301
Not a damn scratch on him.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.137
- You know him?
- Donnie Finnerman. Mechanic there.

12:43.304 --> 12:47.183
And let me guess.
He just vanished into thin air?

12:47.725 --> 12:49.810
Uh, no, Kolchak.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.229
He's down at St. Pete's.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.066
St. Pete's.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.527
Thank you.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.907
I take it that's not Raphael anymore.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.742
Just an empty vessel.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.995
This what I'm looking at
if Michael jumps my bones?

13:08.162 --> 13:09.497
No, not at all.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.624
Michael is much more powerful.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.126
It'll be far worse for you.

13:33.855 --> 13:34.897
Sam?

13:35.064 --> 13:37.024
<i>Hey, Bobby. How you doing?</i>

13:37.191 --> 13:41.112
Well, I ain't running any marathons,
but I'll live.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.239
<i>Where are you?</i>

13:43.406 --> 13:45.783
Uh, Garber, Oklahoma.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.952
I found a town
showing Revelation omens.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.037
<i>- What omens?
- All right, listen to this.</i>

13:50.204 --> 13:53.708
"And upon his rising, there shall be
hail and fire mixed with blood."

13:53.875 --> 13:55.459
<i>- Ain't that delightful.
- Yeah.</i>

13:55.626 --> 13:59.839
We already got hailstorms and fires.
Guessing blood can't be too far behind.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.507
Okay.

14:02.717 --> 14:05.553
<i>- What?
- There a reason you're calling?</i>

14:08.472 --> 14:09.640
Dean didn't tell you?

14:09.807 --> 14:11.392
He told me.

14:11.559 --> 14:15.021
Yeah, well, so I just thought you might
wanna find out who's in the area...

14:15.188 --> 14:16.898
<i>...put a man on this.
- Okay.</i>

14:17.064 --> 14:19.609
Let me see if I can think
of the best hunter...

14:19.775 --> 14:21.944
...who might be
in the immediate vicinity.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.779
Oh, that'd be you.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.450
I can't. I'm sitting this one out.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.327
- Sam.
- I gotta go. I'm so sorry.

14:29.493 --> 14:30.536
<i>Hold on. Sam...</i>

15:00.525 --> 15:01.609
Where've you been?

15:02.318 --> 15:05.530
- Jerusalem.
- Oh, how was it?

15:05.696 --> 15:06.739
Arid.

15:08.574 --> 15:13.830
- What is that?
- It's oil. It's very special and very rare.

15:14.956 --> 15:18.709
Good, we're gonna trap Raphael
with a nice vinaigrette?

15:18.876 --> 15:20.753
- No.
- So this ritual of yours...

15:20.920 --> 15:23.089
...when's it gotta go down?
- Sunrise.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.425
You keep saying
we're gonna trap this guy.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.554
Isn't that like trapping
a hurricane with a butterfly net?

15:29.720 --> 15:31.430
No, it's harder.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.684
- We have any chance of surviving this?
- You do.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.648
- Odds are you're a dead man tomorrow?
- Yes.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.484
Oh.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.362
Well, last night on earth. What, uh...?

15:47.572 --> 15:49.532
What are your plans?

15:50.867 --> 15:52.910
I just thought I'd sit here quietly.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.541
Dude, come on. Anything?
Hm? Booze, women.

16:04.297 --> 16:08.217
You have been with a woman before,
right? Or an angel, at least?

16:12.013 --> 16:14.390
You've never been up there
doing cloud seeding?

16:14.557 --> 16:16.642
Look, I've never had occasion, okay?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.567
All right.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.779
There are two things that
I know for certain.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.824
One, Bert and Ernie are gay.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.495
Two, you are not gonna die a virgin.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.205
Not on my watch.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.374
Let's go.

16:44.879 --> 16:45.963
Hey, Sam.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.342
Sam.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.178
Sam? What happened to Keith?

16:56.140 --> 16:58.768
- What?
- He called you Sam.

16:58.935 --> 17:02.063
- Yeah. Uh, Sam's my middle name.
- Keith Sam?

17:03.523 --> 17:06.233
- Man, I'm sorry.
- Well, actually, it's Samuel.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.319
So it's not quite as dumb
as it sounds.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.199
- Are you guys friends?
- Hunting buddies with his dad.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.786
But Samuel here
is quite the hunter himself.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.162
Wow.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.707
- You kill deer and things?
- Yeah, and things.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.167
Uh, why don't I get you guys
some drinks?

17:26.337 --> 17:28.381
Sorry. Didn't mean
to bust you back there.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.217
No, it's all right.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.427
- So, what's up?
- Well, Bobby called.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.264
- And?
- You were right.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.099
Major demon block party going on.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.643
- Why? What are they up to?
- Don't know yet.

17:40.810 --> 17:44.605
Bobby told us you were off limits.
That true?

17:47.692 --> 17:48.818
Yeah, that's right.

17:48.985 --> 17:52.196
That's fine in theory, but we could
use all hands on deck here.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.448
I know you could.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.161
- But I can't. I'm sorry.
- Why not?

18:00.538 --> 18:03.875
- It's personal.
- Look, Sam, no offense...

18:04.041 --> 18:07.670
...but what baggage is so heavy it can't
be stowed away for the apocalypse?

18:10.256 --> 18:12.008
- Like I said...
- Yeah.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.802
You're sorry. Heard you the first time.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.015
Okay.

18:19.765 --> 18:23.227
Suit yourself. More for us, then, right?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.062
Good luck.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.274
But, hey, beers are on you
when we get back.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.067
Yeah, you bet.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.199
So your parents were drunk
when they named you...

18:36.365 --> 18:39.076
...and you shoot Bambi?
- Look, it's a long story.

18:39.243 --> 18:44.081
That is it. Enough with the kung fu
wandering-the-earth thing.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.709
I'm gonna buy you dinner
and we're gonna talk.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.545
- Lindsey, I can't.
- No.

18:49.712 --> 18:52.256
The only way to avoid bloodshed
is to say yes.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.811
Hey.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.772
Relax.

19:07.939 --> 19:10.900
This is a den of iniquity.
I should not be here.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.736
Dude, you full-on rebelled
against heaven.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.490
Iniquity is one of the perks.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.450
Showtime.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.370
Hi. What's your name?

19:28.209 --> 19:30.503
Cass. His name is Cass.
What's your name?

19:30.670 --> 19:33.047
- Chastity.
- Chastity?

19:33.214 --> 19:34.715
- Mm-hm.
- Wow.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.426
Is that kismet or what, buddy? Huh?

19:37.885 --> 19:42.974
<i>Well, he likes you
and you like him, so dayenu.</i>

19:43.140 --> 19:45.268
Come on. Come on, baby.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.232
Oh, hey. Listen.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.442
Take this.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.778
If she asks for a credit card, no.

19:55.945 --> 19:59.407
And just stick to the basics, okay?
Do not order off the menu.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.242
Go get her, tiger.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.745
Don't make me push you.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.964
Well, cheers to you. Heh.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.092
What?

20:18.968 --> 20:21.220
Get out of my face! Leave me alone!

20:21.387 --> 20:24.348
Bastard! Screw you, jerk!

20:24.515 --> 20:26.017
I'll kill you!

20:26.184 --> 20:28.227
Screw you too! God!

20:28.477 --> 20:31.022
Ah! Jerk! Bastard! Ugh!

20:31.189 --> 20:33.274
- What the hell did you do?
- I don't know.

20:34.192 --> 20:38.196
I just looked her in the eyes and told her
it wasn't her fault that her father ran off.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.490
It was because he hated his job
at the post office.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.452
- Oh, no, man.
- What?

20:44.619 --> 20:49.499
This whole industry runs on
absent fathers. It's the natural order.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.127
We should go. Come on.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.263
What's so funny?

21:06.474 --> 21:08.476
Oh, nothing.

21:08.643 --> 21:11.812
Whew. It's been a long time
since I've laughed that hard.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.777
It's been more than a long time.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.779
Years.

21:22.990 --> 21:26.869
So are you gonna tell me
who those guys back there really were?

21:27.036 --> 21:28.538
And don't say hunting buddies.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.124
Okay. Um...

21:32.291 --> 21:34.585
We used to be in the same business
together.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.629
What business?

21:38.172 --> 21:39.966
How's your salad?

21:43.719 --> 21:45.721
Witness protection, right?
You're Mafia?

21:47.348 --> 21:48.432
I'm not Mafia.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.060
Okay. I get it.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.770
I don't mean to pry. My bad.

21:59.861 --> 22:02.446
I used to be in business
with my brother.

22:02.613 --> 22:06.367
Truth is, I was pretty good at the job.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.621
But I made some mistakes.

22:10.788 --> 22:13.583
You know, I did some stuff
I'm not so proud of...

22:13.749 --> 22:15.918
...and people got hurt.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.754
A lot of people.

22:23.718 --> 22:24.844
What was your poison?

22:26.429 --> 22:28.723
- Sorry?
- Come on.

22:28.890 --> 22:31.058
You were hooked on something.
I know the look.

22:38.316 --> 22:40.234
Three years sober.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.654
- You work in a bar.
- So do you.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.617
Look, Keith.

22:48.618 --> 22:52.538
I don't know you and I'm
the last person to be giving advice.

22:52.705 --> 22:58.419
But I do know that no one
has ever done anything so bad...

22:59.295 --> 23:01.589
...that they can't be forgiven...

23:02.423 --> 23:04.842
...that they can't change.

23:26.131 --> 23:32.137
When the oil burns, no angel can touch
or pass through the flames, or he dies.

23:32.971 --> 23:36.266
Okay. So we trap him in a steel cage
of holy fire.

23:36.433 --> 23:39.894
But one question.
How the hell do we get him here?

23:40.061 --> 23:46.985
There's, well, almost an open phone line
between a vessel and his angel.

23:48.736 --> 23:51.448
One just has to know how to dial.

24:10.300 --> 24:13.720
I'm here, Raphael.

24:14.179 --> 24:17.390
Come and get me, you little bastard.

24:25.273 --> 24:28.401
Just out of curiosity, what is
the average customer wait time...

24:28.568 --> 24:30.779
...to speak to an archangel?

24:32.030 --> 24:33.740
Be ready.

24:54.302 --> 24:57.222
Well, that's a day I'll never get back.

25:02.102 --> 25:03.186
Dean. Wait.

25:16.950 --> 25:19.702
- Castiel.
- Raphael.

25:22.330 --> 25:24.666
Oh, I thought you were supposed
to be impressive.

25:24.833 --> 25:26.459
All you do is black out the room?

25:26.626 --> 25:28.711
And the eastern seaboard.

25:31.923 --> 25:36.803
It is a testament to my unending mercy
that I don't smite you here and now.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.430
Or maybe you're full of crap.

25:41.850 --> 25:44.811
Maybe you're afraid God
will bring Cass back to life again...

25:44.978 --> 25:47.147
...and smite you, you candy-ass skirt.

25:48.773 --> 25:51.317
- By the way, hi, I'm Dean.
- I know who you are.

25:53.403 --> 25:56.614
And now thanks to him,
I know where you are.

25:56.781 --> 25:58.867
You won't kill him.

25:59.033 --> 26:01.578
- You wouldn't dare.
- But I will take him to Michael.

26:01.744 --> 26:05.457
Well, that sounds terrifying. It does.

26:06.291 --> 26:09.752
But I hate to tell you...

26:10.587 --> 26:13.047
...I'm not going anywhere with you.

26:14.215 --> 26:17.802
Surely you remember
Zachariah giving you stomach cancer.

26:22.098 --> 26:24.100
Yeah. That was... That was hilarious.

26:24.267 --> 26:29.230
Yes. Well, he doesn't have anything
close to my imagination.

26:29.397 --> 26:30.815
Oh, yeah?

26:39.282 --> 26:41.910
- I bet you didn't imagine one thing.
- What?

26:42.535 --> 26:45.413
We knew you were coming,
you stupid son of a bitch.

27:02.972 --> 27:05.141
Don't look at me. It was his idea.

27:12.398 --> 27:15.235
- Where is he?
- God?

27:16.778 --> 27:18.530
Didn't you hear?

27:18.696 --> 27:20.573
He's dead, Castiel.

27:22.784 --> 27:24.119
Dead.

27:30.792 --> 27:32.794
Bar's closed.

27:37.132 --> 27:39.968
- Hey.
- Something you wanna tell me, Sam?

27:40.135 --> 27:42.846
What? No.

27:43.847 --> 27:45.473
You sure about that?

27:46.683 --> 27:48.476
I don't kn...

27:49.602 --> 27:50.812
Jeez.

27:51.438 --> 27:53.273
Are you okay?

27:54.023 --> 27:55.358
Where are Reggie and Steve?

27:55.942 --> 27:58.319
Oh, Steve's good. He's, uh...

27:58.987 --> 28:02.365
His guts are laying roadside
outside the Hawley five-and-dime.

28:05.702 --> 28:07.829
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry don't cut it, Sam.

28:08.663 --> 28:10.540
- What do you want me to say?
- The truth.

28:13.585 --> 28:17.881
Okay, fine.
Gonna give you some of my own, then.

28:18.298 --> 28:21.176
We go into town
and capture ourselves a demon...

28:21.342 --> 28:23.094
...we get jumped by 10 more.

28:23.553 --> 28:25.513
Steve bought it.

28:26.931 --> 28:28.391
I'm sorry.

28:29.309 --> 28:31.644
Saying it twice don't make it so, Sam.

28:32.979 --> 28:35.231
You see, this demon, he, um...

28:35.398 --> 28:37.025
He told us things.

28:37.192 --> 28:39.194
Crazy things. Things about you, Sam.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.029
- Demons lie.
- Yeah?

28:43.323 --> 28:46.075
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

28:46.701 --> 28:49.120
The truth. Now.

28:51.122 --> 28:53.625
- Come on.
- Lindsey.

28:57.587 --> 28:59.798
What's going on?

29:06.822 --> 29:08.949
But there's no other explanation.

29:09.116 --> 29:10.659
He's gone for good.

29:10.826 --> 29:12.619
- You're lying.
- Am I?

29:12.786 --> 29:15.997
Do you remember the 20th century?

29:16.164 --> 29:18.834
Think the 21st is going any better?

29:19.000 --> 29:23.255
You think God would have let
any of that happen if he were alive?

29:25.841 --> 29:29.636
Oh, yeah? Well, then,
who invented the Chinese basket trick?

29:29.886 --> 29:30.971
Careful.

29:31.138 --> 29:33.640
That's my father
you're talking about, boy.

29:33.807 --> 29:36.435
Yeah, who would be so proud
to know...

29:36.601 --> 29:39.146
...that his son
started the frigging apocalypse.

29:39.312 --> 29:41.231
Who ran off and disappeared.

29:41.398 --> 29:45.902
Who left no instructions
and a world to run.

29:48.655 --> 29:50.657
So Daddy ran away and disappeared.

29:52.159 --> 29:54.536
Didn't happen to work
for the post office, did he?

29:54.703 --> 29:56.204
This is funny to you?

29:56.371 --> 29:58.498
You're living in a godless universe.

29:59.541 --> 30:02.210
And? What, you and the other kids
just decide...

30:02.377 --> 30:04.379
...to throw an apocalypse
while he's gone?

30:04.838 --> 30:06.798
We're tired.

30:07.924 --> 30:09.801
We just want it to be over.

30:11.053 --> 30:12.637
We just want...

30:14.473 --> 30:15.724
...paradise.

30:17.934 --> 30:19.978
So, what, God dies
and makes you the boss.

30:20.145 --> 30:23.648
And you think you can do
whatever you want?

30:24.024 --> 30:27.736
Yes. And whatever we want, we get.

30:30.864 --> 30:32.616
Just take it easy, okay?

30:33.533 --> 30:34.576
Put the knife down.

30:52.052 --> 30:53.345
It's true.

30:54.262 --> 30:56.681
What the demon said, it's all true.

30:56.848 --> 30:59.184
- Keep going.
- Why?

30:59.518 --> 31:01.770
You gonna hate me any less?

31:02.521 --> 31:04.314
Am I gonna hate myself any less?

31:05.899 --> 31:08.068
- What do you want?
- I wanna hear you say it.

31:16.159 --> 31:17.744
I did it.

31:19.079 --> 31:21.581
I started the apocalypse.

31:21.748 --> 31:25.544
If God is dead, why have I returned?

31:25.711 --> 31:27.629
Who brought me back?

31:27.796 --> 31:31.717
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe Lucifer raised you?

31:33.218 --> 31:35.429
- No.
- Think about it.

31:35.595 --> 31:39.391
He needs all the rebellious angels
he can find.

31:41.017 --> 31:42.561
You know it adds up.

31:46.106 --> 31:47.149
Let's go.

31:47.315 --> 31:48.900
Castiel.

31:49.067 --> 31:50.527
I'm warning you.

31:50.694 --> 31:51.945
Do not leave me here.

31:54.948 --> 31:56.241
I will find you.

31:58.577 --> 31:59.703
Maybe one day.

32:00.912 --> 32:04.207
But today you're my little bitch.

32:09.963 --> 32:12.132
What he said.

32:20.015 --> 32:21.058
What is that?

32:21.808 --> 32:23.310
What do you think it is?

32:24.936 --> 32:26.146
It's go juice, Sammy boy.

32:26.313 --> 32:29.775
- Get that away from me.
- Away from you? No.

32:30.317 --> 32:31.902
This is for you.

32:32.611 --> 32:35.655
Hell, if that demon wasn't
right as rain.

32:35.822 --> 32:37.491
Down the hatch, son.

32:37.657 --> 32:38.950
You're insane.

32:39.117 --> 32:40.952
Look, here's what's gonna happen.

32:41.119 --> 32:44.039
You're gonna drink this, Hulk out...

32:44.498 --> 32:47.959
...and waste every one of those
demon scum that killed my best friend.

32:51.588 --> 32:52.672
Or she dies.

32:53.882 --> 32:55.217
You wouldn't do that.

32:55.384 --> 32:58.261
It's funny how watching
your best friend die changes that.

32:59.179 --> 33:02.933
Come on, you know you want it, Sam.
Just reach out and take it.

33:46.727 --> 33:48.729
There. Was that really so bad?

33:53.191 --> 33:54.943
Ah! Ow!

34:27.516 --> 34:28.601
Go.

34:30.353 --> 34:33.273
- Don't think we won't be back.
- Don't think I won't be here.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.713
Hey, you okay?

35:01.009 --> 35:04.888
Look, I'll be the first to tell you
that this little crusade of yours is nuts.

35:06.515 --> 35:09.142
But I do know a little something
about missing fathers.

35:10.435 --> 35:11.561
What do you mean?

35:11.728 --> 35:14.564
I mean there were times
when I was looking for my dad...

35:15.190 --> 35:17.234
...when all logic said that
he was dead.

35:19.277 --> 35:23.782
But I knew in my heart
that he was still alive.

35:25.992 --> 35:28.245
Who cares what some
Ninja Turtle says, Cass?

35:28.412 --> 35:30.330
What do you believe?

35:33.792 --> 35:35.127
I believe he's out there.

35:35.293 --> 35:38.213
Good. Then go find him.

35:42.759 --> 35:43.844
What about you?

35:44.386 --> 35:46.221
What about me?

35:47.639 --> 35:49.474
I don't know.

35:49.808 --> 35:52.894
Honestly, I'm good.

35:53.770 --> 35:57.357
I can't believe I'm saying that,
but I am. I'm...

35:57.649 --> 35:59.151
I'm really good.

35:59.735 --> 36:02.070
Even without your brother?

36:03.947 --> 36:06.074
Especially without my brother.

36:07.451 --> 36:11.329
I mean, I spent so much time
worrying about the son of a bitch.

36:11.663 --> 36:14.458
I mean, I've had more fun with you
in the past 24 hours...

36:14.624 --> 36:17.169
...than I've had with Sam in years.

36:17.335 --> 36:18.962
And you're not that much fun.

36:23.133 --> 36:26.762
It's funny, you know?
I've been so chained to my family.

36:27.137 --> 36:29.556
But now that I'm alone...

36:30.474 --> 36:32.517
...hell, I'm happy.

36:45.155 --> 36:47.616
Sam. Sam.

37:03.340 --> 37:06.593
So this is your life now?

37:09.471 --> 37:14.393
Think you can just live forever
with your head buried in the sand?

37:20.357 --> 37:22.150
I love you, Jess.

37:28.156 --> 37:31.284
God knows how much I miss you too.

37:33.203 --> 37:35.288
But you're wrong.

37:35.497 --> 37:37.624
People can change.

37:37.791 --> 37:40.335
There is reason for hope.

37:43.755 --> 37:45.507
No, Sam.

37:46.299 --> 37:47.884
There isn't.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.061
How can you be so sure?

37:58.770 --> 38:00.313
Because you freed me.

38:07.029 --> 38:08.196
That's right.

38:10.866 --> 38:12.075
You know who I am?

38:14.036 --> 38:15.120
Lucifer.

38:15.287 --> 38:18.165
You are a hard one to find, Sam.

38:18.540 --> 38:20.667
Harder than most humans.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.588
I don't suppose you'll tell me
where you are?

38:24.755 --> 38:26.173
What do you want with me?

38:26.339 --> 38:28.341
Thanks to you...

38:28.675 --> 38:30.218
...I walk the earth.

38:31.386 --> 38:34.598
I wanna give you a gift.
I wanna give you everything.

38:34.765 --> 38:36.391
I don't want anything from you.

38:40.520 --> 38:43.357
I'm so sorry, Sam. I really am.

38:43.523 --> 38:47.736
But Nick here is just an improvisation.

38:48.070 --> 38:49.571
Plan B.

38:49.738 --> 38:52.908
He can barely contain me
without spontaneously combusting.

38:53.075 --> 38:54.409
What are you talking about?

38:55.994 --> 38:58.622
Why do you think
you were in that chapel?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.668
You're the one, Sam.

39:04.586 --> 39:06.254
You're my vessel.

39:07.005 --> 39:08.715
My true vessel.

39:10.884 --> 39:12.177
No.

39:13.845 --> 39:15.138
Yes.

39:16.973 --> 39:19.434
No. That'll never happen.

39:19.601 --> 39:22.145
I'm sorry, but it will.

39:22.354 --> 39:26.483
I will find you. And when I do...

39:27.067 --> 39:29.152
...you will let me in.

39:29.778 --> 39:30.987
I'm sure of it.

39:32.030 --> 39:33.198
You need my consent?

39:34.449 --> 39:35.951
Of course. I'm an angel.

39:39.246 --> 39:41.581
I will kill myself before letting you in.

39:41.748 --> 39:43.291
And I'll just bring you back.

39:47.838 --> 39:49.673
Sam...

39:50.799 --> 39:53.385
...my heart breaks for you.

39:54.344 --> 39:56.930
The weight on your shoulders...

39:57.347 --> 39:58.598
...what you've done...

39:59.141 --> 40:01.727
...what you still have to do.

40:02.352 --> 40:04.521
It is more than anyone could bear.

40:04.688 --> 40:07.399
If there was some other way...

40:08.191 --> 40:09.276
But there isn't.

40:12.529 --> 40:14.865
I will never lie to you.

40:15.032 --> 40:17.451
I will never trick you.

40:17.659 --> 40:19.286
But you will say yes to me.

40:20.287 --> 40:21.872
- You're wrong.
- I'm not.

40:24.124 --> 40:27.836
I think I know you better
than you know yourself.

40:31.631 --> 40:32.716
Why me?

40:33.508 --> 40:35.927
Because it had to be you, Sam.

40:39.139 --> 40:41.266
It always had to be you.
