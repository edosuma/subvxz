01:16.702 --> 01:18.096
You sure you don't want me
to walk you home?

01:18.120 --> 01:19.830
It's three houses away, Rick.

01:20.206 --> 01:23.584
Besides, Daddy's probably home
from gun practice by now.

01:23.668 --> 01:25.336
Uh, you're right.

01:25.628 --> 01:27.228
Nothing ever happens
around here, anyway.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.256
I'll see you tomorrow?

01:55.908 --> 01:58.786
Don't be afraid.
I don't bite.

02:03.708 --> 02:05.084
What is that?

02:05.668 --> 02:07.128
An adventure.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.599
Chelsea?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.810
Chelsea, what are you doing?

03:48.771 --> 03:50.022
Dad?

03:50.439 --> 03:51.816
What's wrong with you?

03:51.899 --> 03:53.776
That was a Foley original.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.444
Cost me 80 grand.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.863
Get back in the house.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.199
What happened?

04:00.282 --> 04:01.534
What did I do?

04:01.617 --> 04:03.577
Don't play games
with me, young lady.

04:03.661 --> 04:04.661
Move!

04:12.711 --> 04:14.130
You don't seem very excited.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.133
Your mom's wedding?
Big bash, lots of food.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.860
Then you get the house
to yourself for three weeks.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.136
Whatever.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.851
You don't like the guy?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.019
My mom goes through husbands
like popcorn.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.272
I don't bother to get attached.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.355
Yikes.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.112
- What's that about?
- Gotta be Chels.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.549
You didn't hear about her zoning out
on her old man last night?

04:40.573 --> 04:43.075
She bugged and tossed
some pricey swag of his in the river.

04:43.159 --> 04:45.995
Oh, man. Late again.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.078
See ya.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.339
We wouldn't even look
into this mysterious man story

04:57.423 --> 04:59.175
but the girl's father
hasinfluence

04:59.258 --> 05:00.801
and he asked that
we check it out.

05:00.885 --> 05:02.178
I wanted your opinion first.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.306
To be frank,
this is Chelsea's pattern.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.558
She commits these destructive
acts for attention

05:07.641 --> 05:09.685
and then claims that
they weren't her fault.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.104
Unfortunately,
by humoring her stories

05:12.188 --> 05:14.356
her father encourages
her behavior.

05:15.191 --> 05:17.276
In other words,
she made the whole thing up.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.321
That would be my opinion.
I'm sorry you wasted your time.

05:36.962 --> 05:37.963
I don't buy it.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.633
I mean, Chelsea's flaky,
but she's not stupid.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.093
She's not gonna make up some
goofy guy with a magic eyeball.

05:43.761 --> 05:45.054
It's too crazy not to be true.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.555
Leave it alone.

05:46.639 --> 05:49.225
She's just a troubled kid
lashing out at Daddy.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.018
Nothing for you
to get involved with.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.811
Guess you're the expert
on troubled kids.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.104
You collect them, right?

06:07.743 --> 06:11.539
I tell ya, boys. I feel awful
leaving the office at night.

06:11.622 --> 06:14.583
Each of dear Audrey's gowns
are so precious.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.710
It seems wrong
to leave them alone.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.630
Oh, yeah, Mr. Deakins.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.382
We feel exactly the same way.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.458
We've been working
for this guy for years.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.905
We never watch him
when we're looking up.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.532
I don't know what
he's doing in there.

07:03.382 --> 07:06.010
Don't leave me, Louie!
Hang in there, you hear me?

07:24.194 --> 07:25.354
I'm gonna get us out of here.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.249
Everything's gonna
be okay now, Louie.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.542
You're gonna make it.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.506
What the heck are you?

08:26.048 --> 08:27.508
Behind you!

08:30.761 --> 08:32.888
I'II hold him off as long as I can.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.682
Now get out of here.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.578
I don't wanna hurt you, but...

09:01.166 --> 09:04.461
What's going on?

09:05.713 --> 09:06.714
You tell me.

09:07.423 --> 09:09.063
Who was your partner
in the spooky get-up?

09:10.884 --> 09:12.761
I have no idea.

09:19.435 --> 09:22.938
<i>With this second report
of a spellbinder hypnotizing citizens,</i>

09:23.021 --> 09:24.481
<i>the police have reopened
the case</i>

09:24.565 --> 09:26.400
<i>involving Chelsea Cunningham.</i>

09:27.443 --> 09:29.611
- Told you so.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.196
Now suit up and get out there.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.532
Find out who
this Spellbinder is.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.775
Actually I was thinking
of a different costume tonight.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.653
Hope you don't mind. Found this
in the closet upstairs.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.288
Way retro.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.624
Who's DG?

09:48.380 --> 09:51.967
Ladies and gentlemen, would you
all please raise your glasses,

09:52.050 --> 09:54.386
as it's my pleasure
to introduce your hosts,

09:54.470 --> 09:56.805
Mr. and Mrs. Jim Tate.

10:05.481 --> 10:06.899
Hear, hear.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.567
Thought you were
against this wedding?

10:08.650 --> 10:11.320
I was until my new stepdad
bought me a car.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.989
Those rocks from the groom too?

10:14.448 --> 10:16.825
- The guy must be loaded.
- Way to go, Ma.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.467
{933931

10:56.907 --> 10:59.993
Honey, wait!

11:03.205 --> 11:05.374
[{panflng]

11:42.286 --> 11:44.705
- Wayne, you alive?
<i>- Very funny.</i>

11:44.788 --> 11:45.908
Guess who crashed the party?

11:48.333 --> 11:49.333
Honey, don't!

13:02.240 --> 13:03.241
<i>Switch on your vid-link.</i>

13:03.492 --> 13:04.492
Let's have a look.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.266
McGinnis, what are you doing?

13:29.726 --> 13:30.811
<i>Terry, wake up!</i>

13:45.367 --> 13:47.869
The vid-link captured
that flash of light

13:47.953 --> 13:49.273
just before your little vacation.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.415
So I took a closer look.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.880
<i>Somehow, this information
was fed directly into your brain</i>

13:59.589 --> 14:01.758
<i>where it then played back
before your eyes.</i>

14:02.009 --> 14:04.011
I swear I could smell the water.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.723
With such advanced technology,

14:07.806 --> 14:09.349
and his knowledge
of the human psyche,

14:09.433 --> 14:11.852
this madman should be
considered very deadly.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.819
- You wanted to see me?
- Mr. McGinnis, come in.

14:23.655 --> 14:24.698
No big deal.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.093
I know the past few months
have been rough

14:27.117 --> 14:28.285
with your father passing,

14:28.368 --> 14:30.245
and you moving back in
with your mom.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.272
I wanted to see
how you were doing.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.791
Uh-huh. I'm fine. That it?

14:34.958 --> 14:37.002
I don't bite, Terry.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.462
Have a seat.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.717
I hear you're working part-time
for an actual billionaire.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.470
That must be exciting.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.013
Tell me all about it.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.517
- Huh?
- Terry! Snap out of it.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.727
Hey.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.335
Telling tales in school,
were we?

16:05.215 --> 16:08.385
All of Spellbinder's victims
had one thing in common.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.804
Dr. Ira Billings.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.639
Both Chelsea and Jared
were seeing him.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.558
And so was Cary Deakins,

16:14.641 --> 16:16.685
the auction manager's son.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.354
So Billings found out which
families had access to valuables

16:19.437 --> 16:21.439
by speaking
with the kids at school.

16:21.523 --> 16:22.732
But that means he'd be...

16:24.442 --> 16:26.695
<i>Out there now, waiting for you.</i>

16:28.405 --> 16:30.157
Well, you know how
I hate to disappoint.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.040
Expecting someone?

17:05.150 --> 17:07.319
It's over, Billings.
I know who you are.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.905
I'm glad
that makes you feel superior,

17:09.988 --> 17:11.781
but you haven't caught me yet.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.619
I don't get you, Doctor.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.287
You're supposed
to be helping kids.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.806
How could you take
advantage of them?

17:18.830 --> 17:22.250
Ah, you wanna be
my therapist, is that it?

17:26.004 --> 17:28.215
Then here.
Get to know me.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.385
<i>{933931
- What's happening?</i>

17:34.721 --> 17:38.016
Nothing. He got me again,
I think, but I'm fine.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.809
<i>Put on your vid-link
so I can see.</i>

17:40.185 --> 17:42.687
I'm okay.
Everything looks normal.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.669
Terry, what's going on?

18:06.294 --> 18:08.255
For years, I fought the demons

18:08.338 --> 18:11.132
in the heads of those
ungrateful little snots

18:11.216 --> 18:14.678
while their coddling parents
paid their garbage men more than me.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.846
Now I'm taking what I've earned.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.609
<i>Terry, listen to my voice.</i>

18:30.360 --> 18:33.113
<i>Whatever you're seeing,
it isn't real.</i>

18:35.657 --> 18:36.950
That sure felt real.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.413
You've got to look around,
so I can help.

18:43.248 --> 18:44.248
L'll try.

18:49.421 --> 18:50.839
There! Block now!

18:55.218 --> 18:56.344
<i>Good.</i>

19:02.475 --> 19:03.810
<i>- Look out!</i>

19:12.193 --> 19:13.528
<i>McGinnis, report.</i>

19:13.611 --> 19:15.196
I'm all right.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.489
The visions are gone.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.035
I'm going after him.

19:29.461 --> 19:30.795
Signal's breaking up.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.213
I'm looking
for another frequency.

19:44.726 --> 19:45.726
L got him.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.190
Stop. Now!

20:17.384 --> 20:20.470
Then Batman tied Dr. Billings up
and disappeared.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.682
And you're Mr. Wayne's
new assistant?

20:27.352 --> 20:28.812
Your father was Warren McGinnis?

20:33.775 --> 20:35.151
Stay out of trouble, kid.
