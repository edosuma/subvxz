09:04.669 --> 09:06.754
<i>-A few have ended up in a deal closing.</i>
<i>-That's great.</i>

09:06.837 --> 09:08.631
<i>That doesn't mean I'm gonna</i>
<i>go home with them.</i>

09:08.714 --> 09:12.969
<i>That doesn't mean I'm gonna date them.</i>
<i>Like, it stops at dinner. I'm very clear.</i>

09:13.052 --> 09:14.887
<i>-It's about an experience, right?</i>
<i>-It is.</i>

09:14.971 --> 09:17.056
<i>You're trying to show them</i>
<i>what Tampa's about.</i>

09:17.139 --> 09:19.350
<i>I've picked clients up from the airport.</i>

09:19.433 --> 09:22.186
<i>Like, it's a whole thing.</i>
<i>You wanna close the deal.</i>

09:22.270 --> 09:24.188
<i>Do you Airbnb your room too?</i>

09:24.272 --> 09:26.607
<i>-Did I Airbnb my room?</i>
<i>-[Alexis] What?</i>

09:27.900 --> 09:30.319
<i>She said she's picking</i>
<i>people up from the airport,</i>

09:30.403 --> 09:32.029
<i>so she could have been like,</i>

09:32.113 --> 09:34.657
<i>"A two-bedroom, two-bath,</i>
<i>like, you can stay here."</i>

09:34.740 --> 09:36.367
<i>-That's crossing a line.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

09:36.450 --> 09:38.744
<i>I asked her the question, not you, Lex.</i>

09:39.912 --> 09:42.707
<i>I know, but I'm still gonna</i>
<i>come to the defense, because, damn…</i>

09:42.790 --> 09:45.042
<i>Well, that's great.</i>
<i>I'm so glad you tag team.</i>

09:45.126 --> 09:47.336

09:47.420 --> 09:51.007

<i>to cause that type of reply, for sure.</i>

09:51.090 --> 09:54.260
<i>[Tennille] It's not, actually.</i>
<i>I'm just asking questions.</i>

09:54.343 --> 09:55.761
<i>Are you still in training?</i>

09:55.845 --> 09:58.931
<i>I've only been here a year.</i>
<i>What the hell you mean?</i>

09:59.015 --> 10:00.558
<i>Don't try to call me the fuck out.</i>

10:00.641 --> 10:03.394

<i>that's still in training!</i>

<i>Don't call me the fuck out.</i>

10:12.528 --> 10:15.156
<i>I disagree with you</i>
<i>throwing me under the bus all the time.</i>

10:15.239 --> 10:17.658
<i>I don't throw you</i>
<i>under the bus about nothing.</i>

10:17.742 --> 10:20.828
<i>You have a argument with somebody else,</i>

<i>Don't call me a bitch, 'cause,</i>
<i>bitch, I'm gonna tell you--</i>

10:29.503 --> 10:31.589
<i>You was being disrespectful to me.</i>

10:31.672 --> 10:33.466
<i>I never called you out your name.</i>

10:33.549 --> 10:35.384
<i>You did, though. You came for me.</i>

10:35.468 --> 10:36.969
<i>-Get it right.</i>
<i>-I don't need to.</i>

10:37.053 --> 10:39.347
<i>I'm grown just like you,</i>
<i>so treat me with respect.</i>

10:39.430 --> 10:41.766
<i>-How many deals you gonna close?</i>
<i>-It doesn't matter.</i>

10:41.849 --> 10:43.059
<i>That's not your business.</i>

10:43.142 --> 10:44.352
<i>Zero.</i>

<i>Shut the fuck up, all y'all, because</i>
<i>y'all showing out, and I'm serious.</i>

10:54.654 --> 10:58.240
<i>We did not come here to argue</i>
<i>and call people out their names.</i>

10:58.324 --> 11:01.369
<i>Y'all shouldn't get to this point</i>
<i>where y'all call each other bitches.</i>

11:01.452 --> 11:04.705
<i>Stop calling each other out your name</i>

<i>That kind of just came out of left field.</i>

<i>[Alexis] You.</i>

<i>-[Rena] Colony.</i>
<i>-I started it?</i>

12:56.192 --> 13:00.070
<i>No, but listen, my friend,</i>
<i>she innocently started it, okay?</i>

13:00.154 --> 13:01.489
<i>[Colony] Hold on.</i>

13:01.572 --> 13:04.533
<i>I asked, because I don't know,</i>
<i>"Are you still considered new?"</i>

13:04.617 --> 13:06.452
<i>-I guess that triggered her?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

13:06.535 --> 13:10.080
<i>It did trigger her,</i>
<i>and she didn't like the heat on her and…</i>

13:10.164 --> 13:11.707
<i>-She pulled y'all into it.</i>
<i>-Sure.</i>

13:11.791 --> 13:13.334
<i>Karla, how do you feel about that?</i>

13:13.417 --> 13:16.212
<i>As soon as I saw that finger go this way,</i>

<i>[laughing] I was like, "What?"</i>

<i>That was wild.</i>

13:23.093 --> 13:25.137
<i>Have you thought about apologizing?</i>

13:25.221 --> 13:27.807
<i>Because I know for a fact</i>
<i>it did hurt her feelings.</i>

13:27.890 --> 13:30.893
<i>My feelings are hurt.</i>
<i>I shouldn't have been brought into that.</i>

13:30.976 --> 13:32.436
<i>You owe each other an apology.</i>

13:32.520 --> 13:36.357
<i>I don't think it should be one-sided,</i>
<i>but I don't think she'll give an apology.</i>

13:36.440 --> 13:38.317
<i>Has anyone talked to Tennille?</i>

13:38.400 --> 13:42.780
<i>I talked to her earlier. I told her</i>

<i>-Y'all need to take care of this, okay?</i>
<i>-Please.</i>

13:45.699 --> 13:47.618
<i>So we can turn up for Karla's birthday.</i>

13:54.416 --> 13:58.337

14:04.385 --> 14:06.762
<i>[Anne] Honestly,</i>
<i>I try to keep my distance.</i>

<i>Hello, ladies.</i>

<i>-[all] Hello.</i>
<i>-[Anne] Wait, wait, what?</i>

14:10.933 --> 14:13.519
<i>[Rena] Glad you could join us.</i>
<i>Have a seat. I could scoot over.</i>

14:13.602 --> 14:15.062
<i>Look who the cat drug in.</i>

14:15.145 --> 14:19.149
<i>Well. It's gonna take a whole tiger</i>
<i>to drag me in, baby.</i>

14:19.233 --> 14:21.026
<i>-I took a tiger!</i>
<i>-A tiger?</i>

14:21.110 --> 14:23.153
<i>I love that. Can you… Come on.</i>

14:23.237 --> 14:24.738
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-[Alexis] I love it.</i>

14:24.822 --> 14:26.240
<i>[Anne] I love… That color…</i>

14:26.323 --> 14:28.659
<i>I love the fact that…</i>
<i>Well, you love color.</i>

14:28.742 --> 14:30.119
<i>Yeah, I love color.</i>

14:30.202 --> 14:31.579
<i>How you feeling? How you feeling?</i>

14:31.662 --> 14:33.330
<i>-I feel great.</i>
<i>-[Anne] That's good.</i>

14:38.836 --> 14:41.630
<i>Can we fix this, though? Can we fix this?</i>

14:41.714 --> 14:45.551
<i>Can we do… I cannot continue</i>
<i>until we fix this, please?</i>

14:45.634 --> 14:47.636
<i>-From last night.</i>
<i>-What's the problem?</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:49.179
<i>Something happened last night?</i>

14:49.263 --> 14:50.556
<i>[Colony] Oh, girl!</i>

14:50.639 --> 14:52.349
<i>What we not gonna do is that.</i>

14:52.433 --> 14:54.685
<i>[Alexis] Last night was a little much.</i>

14:54.768 --> 14:58.606
<i>I think that we both were</i>
<i>feeling disrespected at the time.</i>

14:58.689 --> 15:01.692
<i>I think you felt disrespected,</i>
<i>and I think I also felt disrespected,</i>

15:01.775 --> 15:06.113
<i>and I think I was out of place</i>
<i>for calling you a bitch and I apologize.</i>

15:06.196 --> 15:08.324
<i>Oh, well, I accept your apology.</i>

15:08.407 --> 15:10.492
<i>-It's a trigger for me.</i>
<i>-I can understand that.</i>

15:10.576 --> 15:15.539
<i>And, again, it's not my character</i>
<i>to call somebody out of their name.</i>

15:15.623 --> 15:18.125
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>I intentionally was like, "She's a bitch,"</i>

15:18.208 --> 15:20.336
<i>but it is what it is.</i>
<i>I can't take it back.</i>

15:20.419 --> 15:23.881
<i>I just feel like</i>
<i>there was something personal behind it.</i>

15:23.964 --> 15:25.883
<i>You felt comfortable calling me a bitch.</i>

15:25.966 --> 15:28.552
<i>I'm not comfortable with you</i>
<i>feeling comfortable calling me a bitch.</i>

15:28.636 --> 15:31.347
<i>It just kind of, like, came out</i>
<i>because I was pissed off.</i>

15:31.430 --> 15:34.224
<i>Like, I was real pissed off</i>
<i>because I felt offended by</i>

15:34.308 --> 15:37.353
<i>you dragging me into something</i>
<i>that I had nothing to do with.</i>

15:37.436 --> 15:39.813
<i>That's just honestly…</i>
<i>I was really blowed at that.</i>

15:39.897 --> 15:41.899
<i>I'm like,</i>
<i>"What do I have to do with this?"</i>

15:41.982 --> 15:45.319
<i>But it's like, I didn't single you out.</i>
<i>You singled yourself out.</i>

15:45.402 --> 15:48.739
<i>Well, I felt like, you know,</i>
<i>for you to call me down yesterday,</i>

15:48.822 --> 15:51.909
<i>like I said, it pissed me off</i>
<i>because that's not what we're here for.</i>

15:51.992 --> 15:54.745
<i>Calling it for what it is,</i>
<i>I don't see it calling you down,</i>

15:54.828 --> 15:59.541
<i>but at the end of the day, I'm willing</i>
<i>to accept whatever makes you feel better.</i>

15:59.625 --> 16:04.838
<i>So I feel like we can move on, especially</i>
<i>because we do business together,</i>

16:04.922 --> 16:08.425
<i>but I just feel like</i>
<i>I don't know how, like…</i>

16:08.509 --> 16:09.593
<i>Personal relationship.</i>

16:09.677 --> 16:12.680
<i>I mean, I don't think that</i>
<i>we'll completely agree on this.</i>

16:12.763 --> 16:15.557
<i>Yeah, we're gonna agree</i>
<i>to disagree on this one, for sure.</i>

16:15.641 --> 16:17.518
<i>She never wants to own up to her shit,</i>

16:17.601 --> 16:20.062
<i>and I didn't want to go back and forth.</i>
<i>I was over it.</i>

16:20.145 --> 16:23.023
<i>I want to be professional,</i>
<i>we still work together,</i>

16:23.107 --> 16:26.110
<i>but at the end of the day,</i>
<i>you're still not producing.</i>

16:26.193 --> 16:27.236
<i>You're just</i>

16:27.820 --> 16:29.405
<i>a zero-producing bitch.</i>

16:30.739 --> 16:34.493
<i>Can we get a hug?</i>
<i>I want a hug for my birthday.</i>

16:34.576 --> 16:36.704

<i>We can make amends.</i>

<i>We're adults, we're women,</i>
<i>we work on the same team,</i>

16:53.262 --> 16:54.805
<i>but let's not get it twisted.</i>

16:54.888 --> 16:56.974
<i>It's either you like me or you don't.</i>

16:57.057 --> 17:00.185
<i>I'm not going to sugar-coat,</i>
<i>I'm not going to try to kiss ass.</i>

17:00.269 --> 17:01.478

<i>-Hello, my dear.</i>

<i>-[Colony] Good to see you.</i>
<i>-You too.</i>

<i>Cho is actually my client, guys.</i>

17:22.332 --> 17:26.336
<i>Cho is my client.</i>
<i>He's staying at the same hotel as us.</i>

17:26.420 --> 17:28.630
<i>Like, how crazy is that?</i>

17:28.714 --> 17:31.425
<i>So, hey, I invited him down to the pool.</i>

17:31.508 --> 17:34.511
<i>But I'mma keep it professional with him.</i>
<i>He's just my client.</i>

17:35.512 --> 17:37.389

<i>I had an event I had to get to</i>
<i>earlier this week.</i>

17:40.059 --> 17:41.268
<i>-Are you single?</i>
<i>-I am.</i>

17:41.351 --> 17:42.853
<i>Well, some single ladies.</i>

17:42.936 --> 17:45.022
<i>[Anne] You didn't come to swim?</i>
<i>Where's your swimwear?</i>

17:45.105 --> 17:47.232
<i>-I am ready to swim, girl.</i>
<i>-Cho's always ready.</i>

17:47.316 --> 17:50.110
<i>-All he has to do is take that shirt off.</i>
<i>-I'm always ready.</i>

17:50.194 --> 17:53.155
<i>-It's Karla's birthday. We're celebrating.</i>
<i>-Hey, Karla.</i>

17:53.238 --> 17:55.699
<i>Hi, Joe.</i>

17:55.783 --> 17:57.034
<i>-Cho.</i>
<i>-Joe?</i>

17:57.117 --> 17:59.453
<i>-"Cho."</i>
<i>-"Cho." Same shit.</i>

17:59.536 --> 18:02.623
<i>-Karla, do you like your birthday gift?</i>
<i>-[Tennille] What is this?</i>

18:02.706 --> 18:04.541
<i>[all clamoring]</i>

18:04.625 --> 18:08.754
<i>-[Colony] Happy birthday.</i>
<i>-[Karla] Lex! Thank you, babe. Alexis!</i>

18:08.837 --> 18:09.963
<i>[all exclaiming]</i>

18:10.047 --> 18:12.341
<i>-[Tennille] That's so sweet.</i>
<i>-[Rena] One rule.</i>

18:12.424 --> 18:14.134
<i>-Don't backwash.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

18:15.052 --> 18:16.095
<i>[Tennille] Okay, Cho?</i>

18:16.178 --> 18:18.263
<i>[Anne] All right, get us right.</i>
<i>Get us together.</i>

18:18.347 --> 18:21.058
<i>[Cho] </i>Un, deux, <i>boomerang.</i>

18:21.141 --> 18:23.060
<i>-[Anne] That is good.</i>
<i>-[Colony] Yummy.</i>

18:23.143 --> 18:25.062
<i>-[Cho] Don't stop.</i>
<i>-[Tennille] That was great.</i>

18:25.145 --> 18:28.565
<i>[Anne exclaims] Uh-oh. Here comes Cho.</i>

18:28.649 --> 18:31.777
<i>Cocktails and a show?</i>
<i>Ha! Happy birthday to me.</i>

18:32.611 --> 18:35.197
<i>[Anne] Colony, your client</i>
<i>is well taken care of.</i>

18:35.280 --> 18:39.159
<i>Wow, it is definitely not me, but okay.</i>
<i>[sighs]</i>

18:39.243 --> 18:41.745
<i>My taxes I do file single.</i>

18:41.829 --> 18:44.164
<i>[laughing]</i>

18:44.248 --> 18:46.333
<i>Don't come in, Colony,</i>
<i>we got this planned out.</i>

18:47.000 --> 18:50.712
<i>Can you swim? 'Cause you know</i>
<i>sometimes people in Florida can't swim.</i>

18:50.796 --> 18:53.173
<i>-Yes, honey.</i>
<i>-[Colony] Let me put my glasses on.</i>

18:53.257 --> 18:56.093
<i>-[Rena] Just a client, right?</i>
<i>-Definitely just a client.</i>

18:56.176 --> 18:58.637
<i>[Tennille] Bring more clients.</i>
<i>Bring more clients.</i>

18:58.720 --> 19:00.681
<i>[Anne] More clients! More clients!</i>

19:02.558 --> 19:04.977
<i>You like the chocolate</i>
<i>with the caramel on the inside?</i>

19:05.060 --> 19:05.894
<i>[Tennille] Yes.</i>

19:06.478 --> 19:07.855
<i>[Colony] Play Marco Polo.</i>

19:07.938 --> 19:11.900
<i>[Tennille] Come out the water slow. I need</i>
<i>to see it glisten all over your body.</i>

19:13.735 --> 19:14.695
<i>Wow.</i>

19:15.487 --> 19:17.322
<i>[Tennille] You need help drying off?</i>

19:17.406 --> 19:19.366
<i>[Colony] Go after what you want, girl.</i>

19:19.449 --> 19:20.701
<i>Go get him, sis.</i>

19:20.784 --> 19:23.412
<i>-[laughing] Yes!</i>
<i>-Girl.</i>

19:23.495 --> 19:25.247
<i>[Anne laughing]</i>

19:27.749 --> 19:29.293
<i>Phew. Okay.</i>

19:30.085 --> 19:32.671
<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

19:43.891 --> 19:45.309
<i>[Sharelle] We made it!</i>

19:45.392 --> 19:48.395
<i>And we didn't bring</i>
<i>our construction shoes.</i>

19:48.478 --> 19:51.023
<i>-[Juawana] That's a problem.</i>
<i>-A diva knows how to walk in gravel.</i>

19:51.106 --> 19:52.232
<i>[Juawana] Please don't fall.</i>

19:52.316 --> 19:54.526
<i>I play basketball in heels, girl.</i>

19:54.610 --> 19:57.070
<i>-I'm true to this. I'm not new to this.</i>
<i>-[laughing]</i>

19:57.654 --> 20:00.240
<i>[Juawana] Ooh! Oh! I got it.</i>

20:00.949 --> 20:05.120
<i>Now that Monique and Melvin are</i>
<i>our clients, it is a lot of pressure.</i>

20:05.704 --> 20:10.459
<i>Sharelle and I have an opportunity</i>
<i>to make a name for Allure Realty,</i>

20:10.542 --> 20:12.252
<i>and this would be a game changer for us.</i>

20:12.336 --> 20:13.587
<i>[Sharelle] Oh, here they go.</i>

20:13.670 --> 20:15.714
<i>I swear to God, this better be the house.</i>

20:15.797 --> 20:18.842
<i>This is the wow, wow, wow, wow, wow… wow.</i>

20:18.926 --> 20:21.178
<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

20:21.261 --> 20:23.472
<i>[Sharelle] Hello, y'all made it.</i>

20:23.555 --> 20:24.723
<i>[Monique] Hi.</i>

20:24.806 --> 20:28.227
<i>Monique came prepared. I told her</i>
<i>we were going to be in construction.</i>

20:28.310 --> 20:32.272
<i>[Monique] Yes. So, I'm not</i>
<i>messing up my shoes, you know.</i>

20:33.273 --> 20:36.860
<i>[Sharelle] This property is six bedrooms,</i>
<i>six and a half baths,</i>

20:36.944 --> 20:40.781
<i>and 13,000 square feet,</i>
<i>listed for 7.5 million.</i>

20:41.406 --> 20:44.034
<i>This is a wow. Like, the entrance.</i>

20:44.117 --> 20:46.954
<i>-Y'all said y'all wanted big windows.</i>
<i>-[Melvin] Oh, yeah.</i>

20:47.037 --> 20:50.290
<i>So that's wow number two.</i>
<i>Nice neighborhood. It's quiet.</i>

20:50.374 --> 20:52.834
<i>[Sharelle] Spread your arms,</i>
<i>you're not touching your neighbor.</i>

20:52.918 --> 20:55.003
<i>-We're social distancing neighbors.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

20:55.087 --> 20:57.923
<i>-[Melvin] You got two wow factors--</i>
<i>-[Sharelle] We still have seven more.</i>

20:58.006 --> 21:01.635
<i>Absolutely, you know, we flew in</i>
<i>our personal interior designer, Divine…</i>

21:01.718 --> 21:02.552
<i>Hello, ladies.</i>

21:02.636 --> 21:05.389
<i>-Hi, Divine.</i>
<i>-…to help us make a decision today.</i>

21:05.472 --> 21:07.391
<i>-Let's take a look in. Let's see.</i>
<i>-[Monique] Okay.</i>

21:07.474 --> 21:09.017
<i>We gotta give you guys hard hats.</i>

21:09.101 --> 21:11.728
<i>[Sharelle] All right, you guys,</i>
<i>come on in.</i>

21:11.812 --> 21:14.064
<i>[upbeat music continues]</i>

21:16.733 --> 21:18.610
<i>[Sharelle] Let's go to the west wing.</i>

21:18.694 --> 21:21.321
<i>You're gonna need a scooter</i>
<i>getting around all this house.</i>

21:21.405 --> 21:23.365
<i>[Monique] I'm gonna need my hoverboard.</i>

21:24.700 --> 21:27.202
<i>[Sharelle] We are entering</i>
<i>the owner's suite.</i>

21:27.286 --> 21:29.663
<i>You have your indoor/outdoor living,</i>

21:29.746 --> 21:35.419
<i>and we have the amazing bathroom suite,</i>
<i>a bathroom for a queen.</i>

21:35.502 --> 21:36.962
<i>And Melvin, guess what.</i>

21:37.045 --> 21:38.588
<i>You're standing in your shower.</i>

21:38.672 --> 21:41.842
<i>-[Melvin] This ain't no shower.</i>
<i>-[Sharelle] This is the shower.</i>

21:41.925 --> 21:43.677
<i>You can turn this into a little spa,</i>

21:43.760 --> 21:46.930
<i>a meditation area,</i>
<i>whatever you want to do out here.</i>

21:47.014 --> 21:49.057
<i>If the tub is sitting that way, that means</i>

21:49.141 --> 21:51.727
<i>I'm gonna be in the tub.</i>
<i>I wanna make sure I'm looking at</i>

21:51.810 --> 21:52.978
<i>something really nice.</i>

21:53.061 --> 21:55.522
<i>-A nice waterfall wall?</i>
<i>-[Monique] A waterfall would be great.</i>

21:55.605 --> 21:56.690
<i>I like that.</i>

21:57.399 --> 22:00.444
<i>The only way to get</i>
<i>Monique and Melvin their dream home</i>

22:00.527 --> 22:03.780
<i>is for them to have</i>
<i>a say in how it's built.</i>

22:03.864 --> 22:07.200
<i>That's why this home</i>
<i>that's under construction is perfect.</i>

22:07.284 --> 22:09.661
<i>It's way less than the home</i>
<i>that we saw yesterday.</i>

22:09.745 --> 22:12.039
<i>Monique and Melvin</i>
<i>can put their own touches to it.</i>

22:12.122 --> 22:13.582
<i>That's a wow factor.</i>

22:18.503 --> 22:22.966
<i>All right, you guys.</i>
<i>We are in you guys' kitchen.</i>

22:23.050 --> 22:24.217
<i>Wow.</i>

22:25.218 --> 22:27.763
<i>The kitchen that</i>
<i>she ain't gonna cook in. Wow.</i>

22:27.846 --> 22:31.433
<i>The kitchen that I'm going to hire</i>
<i>somebody to cook in because I'm busy.</i>

22:32.309 --> 22:36.146
<i>-[Sharelle] Okay, what's going on, Melvin?</i>
<i>-I mean, I see the potential.</i>

22:36.229 --> 22:38.899
<i>I need to see more. You got more for me?</i>

22:38.982 --> 22:40.942
<i>I'm going to take you to one more spot.</i>

22:41.026 --> 22:44.654
<i>Let's take it outside</i>
<i>and look at this beautiful back view.</i>

22:46.990 --> 22:49.117
<i>You can get your indoor/outdoor living,</i>

22:49.201 --> 22:52.704
<i>and for Mackenzie,</i>
<i>this area is known for horses.</i>

22:52.788 --> 22:56.625
<i>So you can bring your horse,</i>
<i>and Tonto can live out there.</i>

22:57.292 --> 23:00.545
<i>You put pressure on me yesterday,</i>
<i>I have to put pressure on you today.</i>

23:00.629 --> 23:02.381
<i>-I have to keep it real.</i>
<i>-Lay it on me.</i>

23:02.464 --> 23:04.466
<i>[Sharelle] This house</i>
<i>has not hit the market yet.</i>

23:04.549 --> 23:08.261
<i>Soon as it hits the market, it's gonna</i>
<i>go up under contract with multiple offers.</i>

23:08.845 --> 23:12.516
<i>Florida is a competitive market,</i>
<i>and people are looking for this.</i>

23:12.599 --> 23:16.978
<i>I hear what you're saying. I understand</i>
<i>there could be some potential interest.</i>

23:17.062 --> 23:18.230
<i>I mean, I like the home.</i>

23:18.313 --> 23:21.233
<i>There are some things that I'm "eh,"</i>
<i>but probably we can tweak.</i>

23:21.316 --> 23:23.693
<i>-So thank you.</i>
<i>-We'll contact you guys soon. Yeah.</i>

23:23.777 --> 23:25.862
<i>Thank you guys so much</i>
<i>for showing us around.</i>

23:25.946 --> 23:27.989
<i>[Sharelle] Take pictures,</i>
<i>send them to the girls.</i>

23:28.073 --> 23:30.117
<i>Talk it over and</i>
<i>let us know what you think.</i>

23:30.200 --> 23:32.702
<i>-All right. Well, thank you guys.</i>
<i>-Well, thank you.</i>

23:32.786 --> 23:34.621
<i>[Sharelle] We'll hear from you soon.</i>

<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Welcome to Bazaar by Jose Andres.</i>

23:49.386 --> 23:52.931
<i>-Let me do the ultimate gin and tonic.</i>
<i>-It's really nice.</i>

23:53.014 --> 23:54.516
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

23:54.599 --> 23:57.853
<i>I'm going on this blind date tonight,</i>
<i>and I'm super nervous.</i>

23:57.936 --> 24:00.605
<i>I don't know if I know</i>
<i>how to have a conversation.</i>

24:00.689 --> 24:05.318
<i>I don't know if I know how to be funny,</i>
<i>how to be sexy, how to be attractive.</i>

24:05.402 --> 24:08.321
<i>Well, I'm attractive, but…</i>

24:08.405 --> 24:10.991
<i>I just… It's a lot of stress.</i>

24:11.908 --> 24:13.034
<i>-[man] Hello.</i>
<i>-Hi.</i>

24:13.118 --> 24:14.911
<i>-Keron.</i>
<i>-Keron?</i>

24:14.995 --> 24:16.580
<i>Nice to meet you. I'm Juawana.</i>

24:16.663 --> 24:18.290
<i>Juawana. You look amazing tonight.</i>

24:18.373 --> 24:19.541
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:20.125 --> 24:21.126
<i>Were you waiting long?</i>

24:21.209 --> 24:23.587
<i>No. I wasn't waiting long.</i>
<i>Thanks for asking.</i>

24:23.670 --> 24:26.256
<i>I don't want to keep</i>
<i>a beautiful woman like you waiting.</i>

24:26.339 --> 24:29.259
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-Especially with that Colgate smile.</i>

24:29.342 --> 24:31.636
<i>-Oh, my goodness. [laughing]</i>
<i>-I'm telling you.</i>

24:31.720 --> 24:33.763
<i>Let me give you a cheers.</i>
<i>Let's break the ice.</i>

24:33.847 --> 24:35.474
<i>You gonna drink my water to cheers?</i>

24:35.557 --> 24:38.101
<i>That's how we do it.</i>
<i>I want to kiss you indirectly right here.</i>

24:38.185 --> 24:41.396
<i>-Oh, my God. Okay.</i>
<i>-[both laughing]</i>

24:43.273 --> 24:44.858
<i>[Juawana] This is a fun fact.</i>

24:44.941 --> 24:47.736
<i>I haven't been on a date</i>
<i>in seven and a half years.</i>

24:48.278 --> 24:49.821
<i>[speaking Portuguese]</i>

24:49.905 --> 24:51.865
<i>Yeah, currently legally separated.</i>

24:51.948 --> 24:52.908
<i>Okay, that's great.</i>

24:52.991 --> 24:54.242
<i>It's great?</i>

24:55.160 --> 24:56.578
<i>So now it's a give-and-take.</i>

24:56.661 --> 24:58.622
<i>You know something about me.</i>
<i>What about you?</i>

24:58.705 --> 25:01.458
<i>I recently got out</i>
<i>of the military last year.</i>

25:01.541 --> 25:04.794
<i>Maybe that's why Sharelle thought</i>
<i>we would be a good fit.</i>

25:04.878 --> 25:07.380
<i>Well, you are real estate,</i>
<i>you like structure.</i>

25:07.464 --> 25:08.882
<i>I do like structure.</i>

25:08.965 --> 25:11.259
<i>"Why you left the damn dishes</i>
<i>inside the sink?"</i>

25:11.343 --> 25:13.136
<i>"You didn't use a coaster."</i>

25:13.803 --> 25:15.222
<i>You see? I'm military.</i>

25:15.305 --> 25:17.390
<i>I'm just the same way.</i>
<i>I'll tell you one thing.</i>

25:17.474 --> 25:21.811
<i>There's something that I hold true</i>
<i>to myself, and it's a way of life.</i>

25:21.895 --> 25:23.230
<i>It's called</i>

25:23.313 --> 25:24.773
<i>sperm retention.</i>

25:27.359 --> 25:28.193
<i>Sperm?</i>

25:28.276 --> 25:29.152
<i>Retention.</i>

25:30.153 --> 25:32.239
<i>Wait, S-P-E-R-M?</i>

25:32.322 --> 25:33.949
<i>-Yes, sperm, semen retention.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

25:34.032 --> 25:36.368
<i>-I want to make sure I had the right word.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

25:36.451 --> 25:39.246
<i>What I've understood is…</i>
<i>because I have many failed relationships.</i>

25:39.329 --> 25:40.330
<i>Many?</i>

25:40.413 --> 25:44.501
<i>And what I've realized in my travels</i>
<i>and understanding of life is that,</i>

25:44.584 --> 25:46.336
<i>you know, when a man ejaculates,</i>

25:46.419 --> 25:49.172
<i>his energy sometimes goes down a bit.</i>

25:49.256 --> 25:51.675
<i>Hence the reason why,</i>
<i>before he goes out, you want to be like,</i>

25:51.758 --> 25:54.386
<i>"Hey, honey, let me give you</i>
<i>some ass before you go out."</i>

25:54.469 --> 25:55.637
<i>[squeals] What?</i>

25:55.720 --> 25:58.306
<i>"Why you gotta give me ass</i>
<i>before I go to the club?"</i>

25:58.390 --> 26:02.477
<i>Because you know that</i>
<i>once you milk him dry,</i>

26:02.561 --> 26:06.147
<i>when he goes out there, he has</i>
<i>less charisma, less energy, less aura.</i>

26:06.231 --> 26:08.400
<i>-I've never played by that rule.</i>
<i>-Never?</i>

26:08.483 --> 26:10.944
<i>But you understand that rule?</i>
<i>You've heard about that.</i>

26:11.027 --> 26:13.238
<i>-What you drinking?</i>
<i>-You don't wanna drink this.</i>

26:13.321 --> 26:16.658
<i>You drink this, you're gonna talk about</i>
<i>all types of shit like me, so come on.</i>

26:16.741 --> 26:18.243
<i>[laughing]</i>

26:18.326 --> 26:20.453
<i>[man] So this is a dragon fruit</i>
<i>from Vietnam.</i>

26:20.537 --> 26:22.664
<i>What's on the top of it?</i>
<i>It's some sort of foam.</i>

26:22.747 --> 26:23.832
<i>Sperm retention.</i>

26:24.708 --> 26:25.792
<i>Back to…</i>

26:26.668 --> 26:29.129
<i>Oh, my goodness, this date.</i>

26:30.130 --> 26:31.464

35:42.765 --> 35:45.643
<i>and I'm staying here</i>
<i>because I'm going to see my man.</i>

35:46.561 --> 35:49.981
<i>This should be motivation</i>
<i>for you ladies to get back,</i>

35:50.064 --> 35:51.149
<i>boots on the ground…</i>

35:51.232 --> 35:52.859
<i>-[Tennille] Yes.</i>
<i>-…and start taking over.</i>

35:52.942 --> 35:54.026
<i>Amen to that.</i>

35:54.110 --> 35:56.362
<i>[Juawana] That's the military talk.</i>
<i>"Boots on the ground!"</i>

35:56.445 --> 35:57.697
<i>[laughing] Cheers.</i>

35:57.780 --> 36:00.283
<i>-That's motivation!</i>
<i>-"Boots on the ground!"</i>

36:01.325 --> 36:04.495
<i>[Juawana] But, ladies, I do</i>
<i>want to share something with you,</i>

36:04.579 --> 36:07.498
<i>and I'm super uncomfortable</i>
<i>talking about it with you ladies,</i>

36:07.582 --> 36:10.209
<i>but I feel like we have</i>
<i>gotten a little bit closer.</i>

36:11.169 --> 36:13.588
<i>Um… but I was on a date last night.</i>

36:13.671 --> 36:17.258
<i>I couldn't get out of it.</i>
<i>It was already pre-planned.</i>

36:17.925 --> 36:19.886
<i>-A date?</i>
<i>-[Juawana] By Sharelle.</i>

36:19.969 --> 36:21.429
<i>She-- she surprised me.</i>

36:21.512 --> 36:24.307
<i>-[Anne] Surprised you with your husband?</i>
<i>-Your husband flew down?</i>

36:24.390 --> 36:25.308
<i>Well…</i>

36:25.391 --> 36:27.351
<i>So, that means that…</i>

36:27.435 --> 36:28.352
<i>So…</i>

36:28.436 --> 36:29.979
<i>[suspenseful music playing]</i>

36:32.398 --> 36:34.233
<i>Bryan and I are getting a divorce.</i>

36:39.906 --> 36:41.032
<i>And…</i>

36:41.115 --> 36:43.576
<i>-Are you serious?</i>
<i>-Yes. Yes.</i>

36:43.659 --> 36:46.621
<i>-Wow, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>-I'm so sorry to hear that.</i>

36:46.704 --> 36:51.709
<i>And I… it's been going on for a while,</i>
<i>so don't…</i>

36:51.792 --> 36:53.586
<i>I'm okay. It's been a while.</i>

36:53.669 --> 36:55.963
<i>It's just you guys weren't aware of it,</i>

36:56.047 --> 36:58.925
<i>but I felt that I wanted to share it with…</i>

36:59.008 --> 37:02.511
<i>-[sobs] Don't make me cry.</i>
<i>-[Tennille] I'm about to cry, I'm sorry.</i>

37:02.595 --> 37:05.097
<i>[Anne] Aw, don't do that. Oh, my God.</i>
<i>You guys, don't do that.</i>

37:05.181 --> 37:07.183
<i>[Sharelle] Y'all get teary-eyed,</i>
<i>I get teary-eyed.</i>

37:07.266 --> 37:09.727
<i>I'm supposed to be the one that cries.</i>

37:09.810 --> 37:11.812
<i>[downbeat music playing]</i>

37:13.356 --> 37:15.733
<i>I'm so sorry. Damn.</i>

37:15.816 --> 37:20.404
<i>Okay, without getting too deep,</i>
<i>and you can share if you want to,</i>

37:20.488 --> 37:21.906
<i>but what happened?</i>

37:22.490 --> 37:26.369
<i>If you're not 100% happy…</i>
<i>And I know nothing is perfect. I do.</i>

37:26.452 --> 37:29.163
<i>I get that, but I feel like as women,</i>

37:29.247 --> 37:34.043
<i>we sometimes stay in things</i>
<i>because we're embarrassed.</i>

37:36.087 --> 37:38.005
<i>We don't want people to talk about us.</i>

37:38.089 --> 37:43.344
<i>-We're not sure where we're going to go.</i>
<i>-We're afraid of what people will say.</i>

37:43.427 --> 37:47.181
<i>We're not mad at one another.</i>
<i>We… It's amicable.</i>

37:47.265 --> 37:51.477
<i>But I want a marriage that's</i>
<i>a little bit different than what I had.</i>

37:51.560 --> 37:55.273
<i>And so that is the reason</i>
<i>why I decided to file for divorce.</i>

37:55.773 --> 37:57.400
<i>That's-- that's heartbreaking.</i>

37:57.483 --> 37:59.068
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-[Alexis] I'm sorry.</i>

37:59.151 --> 38:00.861
<i>I commend you for, like… I think</i>

38:00.945 --> 38:03.948
<i>my life changed the minute</i>
<i>I stopped living for other people.</i>

38:04.031 --> 38:06.075
<i>-Right.</i>
<i>-[Anne] I was at a point in my life</i>

38:06.158 --> 38:09.161
<i>where I cared a lot</i>
<i>about what other people had to say.</i>

38:09.245 --> 38:10.496
<i>[crying] And…</i>

38:12.373 --> 38:17.086
<i>And the minute that you start</i>
<i>living for you, your life changes.</i>

38:17.169 --> 38:18.087
<i>[Tennille] That's true.</i>

38:19.213 --> 38:21.966
<i>I've been in your shoes. I know how it is,</i>

38:22.049 --> 38:26.095
<i>and I was worried for the longest,</i>
<i>like what other people would think</i>

38:26.178 --> 38:28.472
<i>when I got out of a relationship,</i>
<i>but I don't care.</i>

38:28.556 --> 38:30.266
<i>-So good for you.</i>
<i>-That's true.</i>

38:30.349 --> 38:33.477
<i>-Thank you, Sharelle.</i>
<i>-I went through it. I never got married.</i>

38:33.561 --> 38:35.896
<i>I was with him for ten years.</i>
<i>We have the kids.</i>

38:35.980 --> 38:38.024
<i>Everything…</i>
<i>It was so hard for me to leave,</i>

38:38.107 --> 38:39.150
<i>but I had to pick me…</i>

38:39.233 --> 38:42.028
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-…you know, so, it's for you.</i>

38:42.111 --> 38:44.363
<i>See, Juawana, everybody loves you.</i>

38:46.157 --> 38:48.409
<i>Okay. Apparently</i>
<i>we're closer than I thought.</i>

38:48.492 --> 38:50.328
<i>[all laughing]</i>

38:50.411 --> 38:53.456
<i>Thank you for sharing it with us.</i>
<i>And I'm proud of you, girl.</i>

38:53.539 --> 38:55.374
<i>I'm proud of you</i>
<i>for doing what's best for you.</i>
