[Eric] <i>Sometimes the world casts</i>
<i>aside the one person who can save it.</i>

00:14.305 --> 00:16.808
<i>She began life as a mere baby,</i>

00:16.891 --> 00:20.186
<i>but by the third grade</i>
<i>that would all change.</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:23.106
<i>With an IQ of 172,</i>

00:23.189 --> 00:25.066
<i>but a cold and distant father</i>

00:25.150 --> 00:27.277
<i>who may or may not</i>
<i>have looked like this man,</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:32.323
<i>young Dr. Wolf would soon be sent</i>
<i>to a special school for geniuses.</i>

00:33.241 --> 00:35.160
You know,
we did our own research on Dr. Wolf,

00:35.243 --> 00:41.041
so this was really unnecessarily...
fun and great. Bravo.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.626
I got a little excited
when I heard she was coming.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.212
Had a couple of Mountain Dews,
found this stock footage website,

00:46.296 --> 00:48.548

and here we are, so...

00:50.508 --> 00:52.844
[Eric narrating]
<i>Earning a PhD at 17,</i>

00:52.927 --> 00:56.806
<i>Dr. Wolf went to work</i>
<i>for the Centers for Disease Control,</i>

00:56.890 --> 01:00.602
<i>-perhaps placing things in very cold vats.</i>
<i>-</i>[freezer hissing]

01:00.685 --> 01:04.939
<i>And then one day, something happened</i>
<i>in a West Virginia cabin</i>

01:05.023 --> 01:07.358
<i>-that would forever change her life.</i>
-[dramatic music plays]

01:07.442 --> 01:11.780
<i>Two hikers were discovered dead</i>
<i>and partially eaten.</i>

01:11.863 --> 01:14.115
<i>After speeding to the scene,</i>

01:14.199 --> 01:17.786
<i>Dr. Wolf discovered something</i>
<i>even more horrible:</i>

01:18.369 --> 01:21.539
<i>the suspect had murdered</i>
<i>and eaten his entire family.</i>

01:22.499 --> 01:25.168
<i>What kind of monster could do this?</i>

01:25.877 --> 01:30.757
<i>After running a series of tests,</i>
<i>she reached a startling conclusion:</i>

01:31.966 --> 01:34.761
<i>the madman harbored</i>
<i>an unknown virus...</i>

01:35.637 --> 01:39.015
<i>that re-animates...</i>
[in distorted voice] ...<i>the dead.</i>

01:39.099 --> 01:42.477
[in normal voice]
<i>Tragically, she was ridiculed and fired.</i>

01:43.603 --> 01:46.981
<i>Dr. Wolf went on to start</i>
<i>her own biotech company,</i>

01:47.065 --> 01:49.859
<i>where she worked with teams</i>
<i>of equally attractive people</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:52.153
<i>to become enormously successful.</i>

01:52.237 --> 01:54.364
<i>Yet convinced the virus is real,</i>

01:54.447 --> 01:57.492
<i>Dr. Wolf has continued</i>
<i>to search for a cure</i>

01:57.575 --> 02:02.080
<i>so that the horror she witnessed</i>
<i>in that West Virginia cabin</i>

02:02.163 --> 02:05.125
<i>-will never happen again.</i>
-[dramatic music crescendo]

02:05.208 --> 02:08.044
[distorted evil laughter]

02:10.296 --> 02:12.382
Oh, my God.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.136
The end played a little darker
than I expected.

02:16.719 --> 02:20.348
But Kanye says never to apologize
for your creative choices.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.268
Although I really wish
I'd gone another way.

02:23.351 --> 02:26.354
[instrumental theme music playing]

02:31.901 --> 02:34.279
I made you a smoothie
from the last of that Porsche guy.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.655
-I thought I finished him.
-Nope.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.991
I found a bag of his face
behind the ice cream.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.952
-I am not gonna miss this.
-Thanks.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.914
Honey, if Dr. Wolf can't cure me

02:44.998 --> 02:47.959
and I lose my mind
like that man in West Virginia,

02:48.042 --> 02:49.502
we might have to make
some tough decisions.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.880
-She's gonna help you.
-Right.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.008
But if she can't, we need a plan.

02:55.091 --> 02:58.845
The plan is, after you're better
we fly to Maui to celebrate.

02:58.928 --> 03:03.057
Or I keep getting worse,
and before I do something horrible...

03:03.975 --> 03:05.643
I need you to kill me.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.438
I like my plan better.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.982
Uses up our credit card miles
before they expire.

03:11.065 --> 03:13.109
Look, I know these
are tough things to discuss,

03:13.192 --> 03:14.986
but we have to talk about them, okay?

03:16.112 --> 03:17.488
It doesn't have to be heavy.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.782
We can make a game out of it,
like "Fuck, Marry, Kill."

03:19.866 --> 03:22.035
Which is something
we stopped playing 20 years ago,

03:22.118 --> 03:24.162
when you chose not to kill
or marry my brother.

03:24.245 --> 03:27.457
Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna fuck
the Charmin guy or the Unabomber.

03:27.540 --> 03:31.002
So, babe... how would you do it?

03:31.586 --> 03:34.005
-I don't know.
-No, come on. Tell me.

03:34.088 --> 03:37.759
-I-- I don't know.
-It's fine. Just tell me how.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.472
Fine. I'd bash your brains in
with a baseball bat.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.266
Oh, my God, are you serious?

03:45.350 --> 03:47.101
You'd kill me with a bat?

03:47.185 --> 03:48.603
I didn't want to play!

03:48.686 --> 03:51.564
And bash my brains in, that is so angry.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.233
Where is that coming from?

03:53.316 --> 03:56.486
I don't know. That's how they kill
the undead in movies.

03:56.569 --> 04:00.907
-Yeah, but I'm your wife. You love me.
-Okay, what's the right answer?

04:00.990 --> 04:04.869
You kiss me on the lips,
and then place a silk pillow over my face

04:04.953 --> 04:07.622
and shoot me through the temple
with a pearl-handled revolver.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.499
You still end up in the same place.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.167
Yeah, but my way is romantic.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.504
Your way is how a gangster kills
a stool pigeon.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.130
[doorbell rings]

04:16.214 --> 04:18.299
[gasps] That's Dr. Wolf.

04:19.008 --> 04:20.468
Did you put out the fancy soaps?

04:20.551 --> 04:23.096
Oh, if I didn't, are you gonna
bash my brains in?

04:23.179 --> 04:25.765
Oh, good, that's not gonna be a thing.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.479
This is it. Are you ready?

04:32.188 --> 04:33.189
I am.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.903
Dr. Wolf, I'm Joel... Hammond.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.613
And this is my wife Sheila.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.324
-I'm so glad to finally meet you.
-[Sheila sighs]

04:43.408 --> 04:44.742
Me too. [chuckles]

04:46.494 --> 04:48.496
I'm sorry.
I haven't hugged anyone in a while.

04:48.579 --> 04:49.789
Am I doing it correctly?

04:50.540 --> 04:54.460
Does this feel more natural?
This is too high, obviously.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.672
-Well, I think your first try felt best.
-Hmm.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.674
Enough of this emotional nonsense.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.552
-Who's this?
-I'm Joel.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.804
You can call him "Slugger."

[pump hissing]

05:09.726 --> 05:11.311
Blood pressure is zero over zero.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.521
Perfect. You could not be more dead.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.774
Do you have any idea how I got this way?

05:16.858 --> 05:20.236
Well, I've only seen one other case
but it might be anything.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.865
The resurgence of an ancient plague,
a mutation of the rabies virus.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.409
I could speculate further,
but it would be as pointless

05:26.492 --> 05:29.495
as trying to observe cold fusion
from the electrolysis of heavy water

05:29.579 --> 05:31.497
on a palladium electrode.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.166
[laughs] Can you imagine?

05:33.249 --> 05:35.960
[laughing, snorts]

05:37.378 --> 05:39.297
She's really funny.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.923
I'm a big fan of your inhalers.

05:41.007 --> 05:45.678
Your use of nanoparticles to produce
lower oropharyngeal deposition is divine.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.055
Oh, that's very sweet.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.391
Dr. Wolf, it's an honor
to have you stay with us.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.770
If you feel at all self-conscious
about kicking me out of my room,

05:53.853 --> 05:55.688
it would be an equal honor
to let you sleep

05:55.772 --> 05:57.106
on the fold-out couch in the garage.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.652
You're trying to trick me. I hate that.
It's why I will not go to magic shows.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.283
-Does that hurt?
-No.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.246
-[groaning]
-Oh, God! Warn people.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.414
How about now?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.708
A little tickle,
like I have a frog in my throat.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.545
I don't believe it.
I'm finally holding the ancient Serbian--

06:19.629 --> 06:21.130
Fuck, how is that helping?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.633
I could ask the same thing
about your girlish hysteria.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.221
I was checking her brain stem
to see if her autonomic nervous system

06:28.304 --> 06:29.305
was still functioning.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.724
Have you shown any signs
of unprovoked aggression?

06:31.808 --> 06:34.519
Unprovoked? No.
Everyone I killed had it coming.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.854
Good. Then it's not too late.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.149
Now why don't you put down the only
known copy of that priceless book,

06:40.233 --> 06:44.070
ideally away from the chips
and Safeway brand guacamole.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.657
This is amazing.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.660
Something written 500 years ago
is going to help me.

06:50.743 --> 06:54.372
And here... is the remedy.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.999
It's taken me years to find
the modern-day equivalent

06:57.083 --> 06:59.710
of these medieval Serbian ingredients.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.380
You can't just run down to the store
and get myrrh.

07:02.463 --> 07:05.299
But I've tested the formula and it works.

07:05.383 --> 07:09.637
Thank God it works. It's all here.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.764
This is gonna change our lives.

07:12.473 --> 07:16.310
Look at it. It's so beautiful.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.444
Oops.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.242
[sighs] I'm beginning to think
I'll never unfreeze my eggs.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.705
I'll stay here in your brown tract home
for a few days

07:35.788 --> 07:39.083
while I adapt the solution I've used
on rats into a human-grade injection.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.336
So, how soon after the injection
will I be cured?

07:42.420 --> 07:45.131
-Never.
-But you said it works.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.257
Always.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.967
You're mad about the guacamole.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.511
Yes. But my point is, it's not a cure.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.305
You're dead
and you're gonna stay that way.

07:53.097 --> 07:57.435
All we can do is halt your deterioration
so you'll remain as you are now.

07:58.019 --> 08:02.273
So she'll never be like the way
she was before, ever?

08:03.357 --> 08:04.400
I'm afraid not.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.781
Well, that's a shame.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.828
[Sheila] I know it's not exactly
what you wanted to hear,

08:15.912 --> 08:17.455
but it's mostly good news.

08:17.538 --> 08:21.125
I'm not getting better
but I'm not gonna get worse.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.504
It's definitely
a glass-half-full situation.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.339
We're still gonna have to kill people,

08:26.422 --> 08:29.133
but I'm not gonna have to find
a lovely way to kill you,

08:29.217 --> 08:31.010
which was causing tension
in the relationship.

08:31.093 --> 08:31.928
It was.

08:33.137 --> 08:37.600
I left open that box of crackers
you love so much just so they'd get stale.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.895
I feel like being undead
has made you more vindictive.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.899
It's made me more everything.
That's what I like about it.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.193
It's made me more confident, fearless.

08:47.276 --> 08:50.071
Last week I told Susan,
"Stop being such a little bitch.

08:50.154 --> 08:53.282
If you want that townhouse,
then just make an offer."

08:53.366 --> 08:57.245
I'd have never been able to talk
to a city councilwoman like that before.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.790
And I enjoy sex more,
and don't care as much about foreplay.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.834
-That's certainly... a good thing.

I'm not sure.
All I know is it'll be a progression,

starting with "That was a little rude"

10:24.081 --> 10:26.167
-and ending with "Run!"
-[Joel] Okay.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.794
We need to move up the timeline.
When can you be ready?

10:28.878 --> 10:32.089
Oh, damn it. I can have everything here
in two days, except for the bile.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.049
The bile?

10:33.132 --> 10:35.551
The book calls for the bile
of a native-born pure Serbian.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.347
Really? Does it also call for the whisker
of an Irishman? [laughs]

10:40.640 --> 10:42.433
It's effective because medieval Serbians

10:42.516 --> 10:44.894
developed intestinal flora
that resisted the virus.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.356
Unfortunately, my bile guy, Vladé,
is on vacation.

Couldn't you just tell Vladé
it's an emergency?

10:50.358 --> 10:51.359
Ah, he won't care.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.027
He's more reliable than my last bile guy,

11:04.205 --> 11:07.583
She told me both her parents are Serbian
and exactly how they died.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.127
And then she made me touch
locks of their hair. Long afternoon.

11:10.211 --> 11:14.173
Great. Tomorrow I'll prep the formula
while you two collect her bile.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.341
Hopefully this will work.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.094
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You said it always works.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.763
On rats. I've only ever done it on rats.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.223
And even then, it's only effective

11:22.306 --> 11:24.850
if it's administered
before they've gone completely feral.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.312
So there's not a cure,
and the partial cure might not even work

11:28.396 --> 11:30.856
because we're too late,
and Sheila's not a rat.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.652
But the good news is I get to make
an elderly woman throw up in a bucket,

11:34.735 --> 11:37.405
which might be a turn-on for some people,
but it's not my thing.

11:37.488 --> 11:41.367
Yet! Who knows? The night is young!

11:43.119 --> 11:44.161
[door opens, closes]

11:44.245 --> 11:46.831
-He seems angry.
-I know, right?

11:46.914 --> 11:49.917
His plan B is to bash my brains in
with a baseball bat.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.628
I wouldn't even do that to the rats.

11:52.711 --> 11:55.840
If I have to put them down,
I dim the lights, play Mozart,

11:55.923 --> 11:57.716
get them high on nitrous oxide,

11:57.800 --> 12:01.220
and then drive a tiny,
mint-flavored toothpick into their brains.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.304
You see?

12:02.388 --> 12:06.267
I've known you, what, five minutes
and already I'd rather have you kill me.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.520
Thank you.

12:13.357 --> 12:15.067
-Have you--?
-Sterilized the cerebral spinal fluid?

12:15.151 --> 12:16.152
-Yes.
-Perhaps you should--

12:16.235 --> 12:18.070
Fractionally distill
the crude reaction mixture? Done.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.530
-Have the--
-Crystals formed? No.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.698
-I wonder--
-Nine point three.

12:20.781 --> 12:21.615
-But I--
-Blue.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.533
-Why--?
-Seven.

12:22.616 --> 12:23.826
Interesting.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.872
Hey, guys. I'm ready to help.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.667
Um, would you like
to chop this table in half?

12:31.750 --> 12:32.877
I don't have a lab coat.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.130
Look, I know we got off to a bad start
with the whole guacamole thing,

12:36.213 --> 12:38.382
but everyone has something cool
to do except me.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.217
Let me ask you this, Abby-san...

12:40.301 --> 12:41.427
Obviously, this was a mistake.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.679
Do you have any knowledge of neuroscience?

12:43.762 --> 12:46.682
I get straight A's
in everything except science.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.517
-Are you good at taking notes?
-Yes.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.478
Take this down, verbatim.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.938
I'd like a turkey sandwich
on whole wheat, no mayo.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.107
Then run to the Rite Aid,
get me a bag of raw cashews,

12:55.191 --> 12:56.817
a bar of free-trade dark chocolate,

12:56.901 --> 12:59.320
and three postcards
with the Hollywood sign on them.

12:59.403 --> 13:00.404
I have nieces.

13:00.488 --> 13:04.074
Thank you for entrusting me
with this super-exciting assignment.

13:04.158 --> 13:07.328
Oh, Abby, wait.
Could you get me a roast beef on...

13:07.912 --> 13:11.499
nothing, 'cause I respect you
and don't want anything.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.962
[doors closing]

13:17.046 --> 13:19.256
I'm still not convinced
that getting an old woman drunk

13:19.340 --> 13:20.883
is the best way to do this.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.719
We are not taking her to Magic Mountain.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.930
People throw up
on those roller coasters all the time.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.598
How are we supposed
to collect her vomit?

13:27.681 --> 13:29.725
Strap a bucket to her face like a horse?

13:29.808 --> 13:31.018
No one would care.

13:31.101 --> 13:34.355
The last time I was there,
I saw a baby wearing an outfit that said,

13:34.438 --> 13:37.399
"My parents fucked nine months ago
and all I got was this lousy T-shirt."

13:37.483 --> 13:40.402
Fact: liquor is the best
and least suspicious way

13:40.486 --> 13:41.737
to get someone to throw up.

13:42.321 --> 13:46.200
Fact: I hate when you do the fact thing,
especially when it's not a fact.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.410
Accurate statement: I know she drinks,

13:48.494 --> 13:50.746
'cause last time I was here
she did shots at 10 a.m.

13:50.829 --> 13:53.290
And, objective truth:
you don't have blood,

13:53.374 --> 13:55.626
so you don't feel alcohol,
therefore you can outdrink her.

13:55.709 --> 13:59.672
So, strongly held opinion:
this is what we should do,

13:59.755 --> 14:03.217
because, crossing a line,
your idea is stupid.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.560
-You know, I was thinking...
-[doorbell rings]

14:12.643 --> 14:16.105
...if it comes to it,
maybe I'll have my sister kill me.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.440
Kathy? That's crazy.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.068
Well, it just seems like
this is really stressing you out.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.695
Maybe it's easier for everybody.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.322
First of all, Kathy's gonna be
40 minutes late killing you.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.283
And she'll probably ask for money
before she does it.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.202
And I don't know what she can grip
with those fingernails.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.538
Certainly not a baseball bat.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.332
[door opens]

14:35.416 --> 14:36.709
[both] Hi!

14:39.044 --> 14:41.422
You man who bring nice box.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.674
That's right! This is my wife, Sheila.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.050
And we brought you another gift

14:45.134 --> 14:47.469
to thank you for helping us
translate those prints.

14:47.553 --> 14:51.724
-Your wife has nice box?
-[laughs] This guy likes it.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.060
We brought you a wonderful bucket.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.187
Nice.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.524
We also got a few bottles
of that Serbian liquor you like.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.152
Maraska.

15:04.987 --> 15:05.988
We drink.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.825
[orchestral music playing]

15:12.369 --> 15:14.747
[music continues over PA]

15:18.667 --> 15:20.878
-Can I help you?
-What?

15:20.961 --> 15:23.547
My manager noticed
that you've been staring at the snacks

15:23.631 --> 15:25.299
for, like, a really long time.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.511
It's just my mom has this illness.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.556
And, um, there's this doctor
who's trying to save her

15:32.640 --> 15:35.100
and she's given everyone
exciting stuff to do except me.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.144
Is excitement important?

15:39.271 --> 15:40.648
I thought so.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.276
But maybe you're right. Maybe it isn't.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.114
My mom's sick.
That's what I need to be focused on.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.325
I should be helping other people.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.494
And maybe I should, too.

15:54.244 --> 15:58.582
Like, lately, I've been doing crazier
and crazier stuff...

15:59.375 --> 16:00.668
and I'm never satisfied.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.462
And maybe that's because
I'm only thinking about myself.

16:03.545 --> 16:06.173
Like with this doctor,
she's in town to save my mom's life

16:06.256 --> 16:09.051
and all I can think about
is she's taken my bedroom.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.429
-So, did you want something?
-Yeah.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.600
Yeah, I do, Ramona.
I want to be more selfless.

16:17.768 --> 16:18.602
Okay.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.355
You make it sound so easy.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.942
Sometimes I see things other people don't.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.533
This should be in aisle five.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.583
Why you no drink?

16:41.667 --> 16:44.378
Oh, I don't want you
to take advantage of me, Mrs. Bakavic.

16:44.461 --> 16:45.963
-Down the hatch.
-Stop!

16:46.755 --> 16:48.549
What are you people doing here?

16:48.632 --> 16:51.301
Principal Novak. Why aren't you at school?

16:51.385 --> 16:53.137
I'm taking a mental health day,

16:53.220 --> 16:55.472
which my therapist tells me
is nothing to be ashamed of.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.976
-My grandson has weak mind.
-[Novak] <i>Baka, </i>you're drunk.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.687
It's before noon. Last week
you got so drunk that you threw up.

17:01.770 --> 17:05.691
-She threw up?
-Exactly how many drinks did that take?

17:06.275 --> 17:07.776
So we know when to stop.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.029
I want you people out of here.
I am calling the police.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.782
-No. My house. They stay. You go.
-I'm not leaving.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.077
They bring me bucket. You bring shame.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.956
He dance in bathroom by himself.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.542
You are a terrible roommate.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.252
And your food is too oily.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.089
[door slams]

17:29.631 --> 17:31.508
You have a beautiful family.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.594
To the <i>baka's</i> family!

17:34.261 --> 17:36.680
No. I finish.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.433
Oh, really? God, I'm just getting started.

17:39.516 --> 17:43.187
I guess American women are better drinkers
than Serbian women.

17:43.854 --> 17:47.900
American women only good at one thing:

17:47.983 --> 17:50.611
boo-hoo about sex with boss.

17:55.449 --> 17:59.578
-I going to be sick.
-Oh, my God, we brought a bucket.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.669
[snoring]

18:07.753 --> 18:09.713
Shit! Now what?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.799
I have an idea.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.009
We're not bringing her
to Magic Mountain.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.804
Then let's bring Magic Mountain to her.

18:18.806 --> 18:22.184
All right, I've synthesized
the dioxatrope and lithium salts,

18:22.267 --> 18:25.020
-which is the first stage of the remedy.
-Fuck yeah!

18:25.104 --> 18:26.146
[door opens]

18:26.730 --> 18:29.233
Sorry. This is kinda like my Super Bowl.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.400
[door closes]

18:30.484 --> 18:31.777
[Abby] Here's your stuff.

18:32.694 --> 18:36.365
I actually had a life-changing experience
in Rite Aid, believe it or not.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.242
Hmm. Not.

18:39.284 --> 18:42.204
I'm uncertain this first stage is safe
for anything bigger than a rat.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.330
What are the risks?

18:43.413 --> 18:46.834
If I've overestimated,
it could cause dangerous convulsions.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.503
But there's no safe way to test it.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.589
But since Mrs. Hammond's dead,
if we guess wrong

18:52.673 --> 18:55.134
she could be stuck
in a convulsive state forever.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.426
Exactly.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.933
-Holy shit!
-What are you doing?

19:03.016 --> 19:04.643
Something selfless.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.855
I'm testing it to make sure
it's safe for my mom.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.481
Are you insane? How do you feel?

19:09.565 --> 19:11.567
-Like a good person.
-You shouldn't have done that.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.694
Eric, I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.738
I just... just...

19:16.822 --> 19:19.074
-Oh, God. She's convulsing. Abby?
-Don't let her bite her tongue.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.993
-I'll get my medical bag.
-Abby?

19:21.076 --> 19:23.036
Oh, don't grab the bag.
I was kidding, I'm fine.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.831
[sighs] You scared the crap out of me.

19:25.914 --> 19:29.042
-That wasn't funny, Abby.
-Oh, it was a little funny.

19:29.126 --> 19:32.087
Look, just 'cause I'm being selfless
doesn't mean I'm not gonna get back at you

19:32.171 --> 19:35.924
for sending me to get snacks
when it's my mom who's sick and--

19:37.843 --> 19:38.927
And--

19:39.469 --> 19:42.264
-Dr. Wolf, what's happening?
-Eric, grab my medical bag.

19:43.807 --> 19:46.476
-Again, kidding. Totally fine.
-[Eric] God, Abby.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.354
-You trying to give me a heart attack?
-I suspected that one was fake.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.064
[Abby]
I'm not a genius like you guys,

19:51.148 --> 19:56.278
but wouldn't it take a second
for my blood to get to my brain and--

19:56.361 --> 19:57.946
[panting] Whoa.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.531
-What's wrong?
-What is this, seriously?

19:59.615 --> 20:01.867
-Seriously, what's happening?
-[Dr. Wolf] Abby! Abby!

20:01.950 --> 20:04.453
-The toxins have reached her brain.
-Uh, no. No, they haven't.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.748
-Motherfucker!
-[laughing]

20:07.831 --> 20:09.958
[gasping and moaning]

20:10.042 --> 20:12.461
-Oh, my God.
-Abby? Abby, can you hear me?

20:12.544 --> 20:16.089
-Yeah, what?
-I hate you so much right now.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.508
Your commitment is outstanding.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.518
What won't we do?

20:29.269 --> 20:32.356
I don't wear fur,
and I won't eat people's buttholes.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.317
Yeah, we're great.
They should name a street after us.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.277
Switch.

20:39.821 --> 20:41.823
Is the Kramers' fiesta pool party tonight?

20:41.907 --> 20:45.827
Yes, Wendy said they were getting
a margarita fountain.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.288
I'm so glad we're doing this instead.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.750
-Honey?
-Hmm?

20:52.376 --> 20:53.669
Do you resent me?

20:54.294 --> 20:55.128
What?

20:55.212 --> 20:58.215
It's just with the whole
bashing-my-brains-in-with-a-bat thing,

20:58.298 --> 21:02.135
and then calling my excellent
Magic Mountain idea stupid,

21:02.219 --> 21:04.263
and now missing the fiesta...

21:04.972 --> 21:07.349
I think you resent me.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.142
I don't resent you.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.813
I just want to get a bucket
of Serbian vomit and go home.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.318
Maybe she has to be awake to throw up.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.821
Fine. I'll go make some coffee.

21:22.114 --> 21:26.660
[yells] Admit it!
You resent me because I ruined our lives!

21:26.743 --> 21:28.829
-[grunting]
-Sheila, get off of me!

21:30.205 --> 21:31.331
[groans, chuckles]

21:31.415 --> 21:34.668
You're mad that you're not
at the Kramers' party. Admit it.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.753
Honey, stop. You're starting to go feral.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.047
We're never gonna get to go to Maui again
without killing someone,

21:39.131 --> 21:40.841
which means it's gonna be
a working vacation.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.969
With technology, every vacation's
a working vacation these days.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.470
-[yelling]
-Oh, my God.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.183
[grunting]

21:50.267 --> 21:52.227
Whoa. Huh.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.395
Oh!

21:53.478 --> 21:56.565
Prague Castle!
Another place we'll never go!

21:56.648 --> 21:58.817
-[plate shatters]
-Come on, I've ruined date night

21:58.900 --> 22:02.946
because when we go to a restaurant
the only thing I can eat is the chef.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.740
We're saving a lot of money
not eating out.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.075
Shit!

22:09.411 --> 22:13.206
Hello, man with nice box.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.959
Oh, look who's up. Help me.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.002
[Sheila grunts]

22:17.586 --> 22:20.130
Look, I just don't want
your resentment to build up

22:20.213 --> 22:22.257
and come out in an inappropriate way.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.801
-You see the irony in that, right?
-[Sheila yells]

22:42.527 --> 22:43.945
All right. I am angry.

22:44.029 --> 22:47.324
I don't like killing people
and stuffing them into freezers,

22:47.407 --> 22:49.451
and throwing away my Pumas
I just broke in

22:49.534 --> 22:51.119
because they got brain on them.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.163
The thing that kept me going

22:53.246 --> 22:55.665
was that one day
our lives would get back to normal.

22:55.749 --> 22:59.544
But now that's gone!
And I don't know if I can keep doing this.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.467
But I'm gonna try.

23:07.302 --> 23:09.846
'Cause I know I'll never do this.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.098
[stick clatters]

23:14.518 --> 23:15.602
[sighing]

23:15.685 --> 23:17.979
I'm so sorry I attacked you.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.732
I'm gonna try super hard
to never let that happen again.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.692
I'd like that.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.946
I'll always do whatever I can
to make us work.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.282
-[knock on door]
-[man] Sheriff's department.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.576
Shit! Novak must've called the police.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.204
Oh, God. Let's get out of here.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.832
[groans] I going to be sick.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.168
You go. We're so close.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.962
[man]
Everything all right in there, ma'am?

23:42.045 --> 23:44.631
-I don't wanna leave you.
-You have to.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.466
You attacked me
for not being emotionally available.

23:46.550 --> 23:47.884
Imagine what you'd do to a cop.

23:47.968 --> 23:51.054
-[knocking]
-Ma'am, open the door.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.765
I'll meet you at home. Go.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.312
-[knocking]
-Ma'am.

24:08.155 --> 24:11.825
Vomit. Please. I just want your vomit.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.327
Sir, I need you to step away
from the woman.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.080
Just give me two minutes.
Dr. Wolf says it's critical!

24:17.164 --> 24:18.665
Her bile guy's on vacation!

24:21.293 --> 24:23.545
-[electricity crackling]
-[grunts] Jesus!

24:26.256 --> 24:28.884
-Did you get the bile?
-Not yet.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.468
Your shirt's torn. What happened?

24:30.552 --> 24:32.721
Honey, I need you to do something for me.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.183
Chain Mommy in the basement.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.520
[Joel] <i>Every marriage</i>
<i>has its challenges.</i>

24:41.104 --> 24:42.397
Mine's no different.

24:43.064 --> 24:45.859
Sheila and I have been together 25 years.

24:47.068 --> 24:50.822
Things were getting a little... routine.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.992
Monday movie night,
Friday night date night at Japopo's.

24:54.075 --> 24:56.286
The food wasn't great--
stay away from the clams.

24:59.372 --> 25:04.502
Japopo's: J-A-P-O-P-O apostrophe S.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.926
Anyway, a few weeks ago,
things started getting a little crazy.

25:11.009 --> 25:14.930
I won't bore you with the details,
but trust me, really crazy.

25:15.013 --> 25:18.141
And that was hard. Not just for me.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.019
<i>For the whole family.</i>

25:21.102 --> 25:23.355
-You can't just leave.
-I'm sorry.

25:23.438 --> 25:26.233
There's no bile, we just got a call
your father's been arrested,

25:26.316 --> 25:27.984
and I can't be here if the police come

25:28.068 --> 25:30.028
because I'm the president
of a biotech company

25:30.111 --> 25:31.863
and there are chunks of people
in your freezer.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.657
What am I supposed to do?

25:34.574 --> 25:37.661
You're a brave, resourceful girl, Abby.
I saw that today.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.037
You'll be okay.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.790
I've left you all my equipment
and the book.

25:41.873 --> 25:45.001
I want it back, so don't treat it
like a placemat at Chili's.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.972
[Joel] <i>Do I miss the way things were?</i>
<i>Sometimes.</i>

25:57.597 --> 25:59.724
But there's so much more
to my marriage now.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.602
Sheila pushes me to do things,
to open up.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.896
It's really exciting, man.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.690
[chuckles]

26:06.773 --> 26:09.317
When I look back at my life
just three weeks ago

26:09.401 --> 26:11.569
I think maybe I was the dead one.

26:11.653 --> 26:14.572
Ha! I was the dead one.

26:18.368 --> 26:22.414
Sure, sometimes the excitement
gets a little out of hand.

26:22.497 --> 26:23.707
[knock on door]

26:23.790 --> 26:26.543
-I got tased, that's cool.
-[door lock buzzing]

26:26.626 --> 26:30.755
But the rest of the time,
and believe me when I tell you...

26:30.839 --> 26:32.382
Hey, guys.

26:35.427 --> 26:39.180
...we're just like any other normal
Santa Clarita family.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.518
-[hissing, fizzing]
-Okay, that's wrong.

26:43.601 --> 26:48.898
Hello, we are interested in hosting
a pure Serbian exchange student.

26:48.982 --> 26:51.067
Do you have one we could get this week?

26:51.735 --> 26:53.737
[duck quacking ringtone]

26:55.822 --> 26:57.073
Hello.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.869
The listing on Summervale?

27:02.537 --> 27:04.372
Oh, it's a beautiful property.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.542
Great location, new kitchen,
marble countertops,

27:07.625 --> 27:09.961
detached bonus room.

27:11.629 --> 27:15.884
Ooh. Tomorrow's not great
for me or my husband.

27:15.967 --> 27:20.638
But hopefully next week
one of us will be free.

27:25.435 --> 27:28.438
