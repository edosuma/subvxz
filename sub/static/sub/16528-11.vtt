00:00.401 --> 00:02.401
  ADULT ADAM:
<i> Ah, the teachers of our youth.</i>

00:02.403 --> 00:04.903
     <i> They pushed us,</i>
     <i> inspired our minds,</i>

00:04.905 --> 00:06.572
<i> and made us who we are today.</i>

00:06.574 --> 00:08.841
<i> And when those great teachers</i>
<i> got sick,</i>

00:08.843 --> 00:12.044
<i> my mom stepped in to be a sub.</i>

00:12.179 --> 00:14.213
       <i> Bonjour,</i>
        my little French fries.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.948
         By the time
         I'm done with you,

00:15.950 --> 00:17.683
        you're going
        to be eating snails,

00:17.685 --> 00:18.617
          not taking baths,

00:18.619 --> 00:21.186
    and enjoying the silent art
    of mime.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.355
    (LAUGHS)
      ADULT ADAM: <i> Like most</i>
     <i> substitute teachers,</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:24.823
  <i> she didn't know very much.</i>

00:24.825 --> 00:26.258
      They're a weird people,
      hmm?

00:26.260 --> 00:28.193
     <i> Then one day,</i>
     <i> everything changed.</i>

00:28.195 --> 00:30.829
    <i> My mom saw the movie</i>
     Dead Poets Society.

00:30.831 --> 00:31.797
                   O Captain!
                   My Captain!

00:31.799 --> 00:32.898
     YOUNG MAN: O Captain!
     My Captain!

00:32.900 --> 00:35.701
 <i> When Robin Williams inspired</i>
 <i> those stuffy rich kids</i>

00:35.703 --> 00:37.002
   <i> to stand on their desks,</i>

00:37.004 --> 00:38.570
 <i> my mom saw her true calling.</i>

00:38.572 --> 00:41.774
 Who knew Mork from Ork
 had such a serious side?

00:41.776 --> 00:43.876
             This movie proves
             that a sub

00:43.878 --> 00:47.046
   is the most important person
   in a child's life.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.615
       Come Monday, that's just
       what I'm gonna do...

00:49.617 --> 00:50.349
             inspire my kids.

00:50.351 --> 00:53.385
 You mean, your students
 or your actual kids?

00:53.387 --> 00:55.154
             Both.
             It's a win-win.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.688
    I'm sure
    they'll see it that way.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.158
 MAN: Hey, shut up!
         You shut up!

00:59.393 --> 01:00.259
      Good morning, class.

01:00.261 --> 01:03.395
     Uh, before we get started,
     does anyone need to make?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.296
                   Hmm? Anyone?

01:04.298 --> 01:05.864
       There's gonna be
       a lot of learning today,

01:05.866 --> 01:08.033
         so if you got to make,
         do it now.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.668
              Anyone got
              to make poo-poos?

01:09.670 --> 01:10.469
                       Stop!

01:10.471 --> 01:11.537
            No one has to make!
               Moving on.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.807
         All right,
         according to this memo
         from Principal Ball,

01:14.809 --> 01:17.776
  Mr. Gluckman has been checked
  into a rehab facility

01:17.778 --> 01:19.745
    to address his relationship
    with c'caine.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.081
      "Please tell the students
      he has the flu."

01:22.083 --> 01:24.783
      Okay.
      Mr. Gluckman has the flu.

01:24.785 --> 01:25.451
             (CHUCKLES)

01:25.453 --> 01:27.453
          I'll be your sub
          for the next 30 days.

01:27.455 --> 01:28.020
     Sweet!
           A sub!

01:28.022 --> 01:29.621
 We get to waste a whole month
 of critical learning

01:29.623 --> 01:31.423
     that'll put us behind
     for years to come!

01:31.425 --> 01:33.058
       No, JTP!
       History has proven

01:33.060 --> 01:35.627
  my mom turns awesome things
  to garbage!

01:35.629 --> 01:37.729
         Aw, who's that
         handsome fella?

01:37.731 --> 01:38.730
          Is he single?

01:38.732 --> 01:39.598
           This is a nightmare.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.866
          Question.
          Who here is familiar

01:40.868 --> 01:42.468
           with the film
          <i> Dead Poets Society?</i>

01:42.470 --> 01:44.436
 Chill, dude.
 Your mom's gonna
 show us a movie.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.105
 It's a classic
 sub move.

01:46.107 --> 01:47.473
     Oh, we're not watching it.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.474
             We're living it!

01:48.476 --> 01:49.541
               Oh, no.
       Barry's right.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.210
         In fact,
         I need a volunteer

01:51.212 --> 01:52.711
      chosen
      completely at random

01:52.713 --> 01:53.812
    to come stand on my desk

01:53.814 --> 01:55.481
     and view the world
     from a new perspective.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.549
  Oh, no!
    She wants us to learn
    by standing on furniture?

01:57.551 --> 02:00.986
  ADULT ADAM: <i> Standing on a desk</i>
<i> was how Robin Williams</i>
<i> inspired his students.</i>

02:00.988 --> 02:04.123
  <i> Unfortunately, not everyone</i>
  <i> liked to see things</i>

02:04.125 --> 02:06.391
   <i> from a different angle.</i>

02:06.393 --> 02:07.326
  Whoa, whoa!

02:07.328 --> 02:09.127
    There's no climbing
    in school!

02:09.130 --> 02:09.828
  Unless it's on a rope

02:09.830 --> 02:12.164
 hung dangerously from
 the rafters of the gymnasium.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.032
              Dude, the hot sub
              told us to do it.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.335
     Are you crazy?
     What do you think
     you're doing?

02:16.337 --> 02:17.569
                (LAUGHING) Ho!
                Look, everyone!

02:17.571 --> 02:21.240
 It's the stuffy administration
 coming to clip my wings!

02:21.242 --> 02:22.708
   No!
   For the past 30 years,

02:22.710 --> 02:25.277
    Mr. Gluckman has sloshed
    corrosive chemicals

02:25.279 --> 02:26.178
    all over that old desk.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.313
 It's falling apart.
           I fear nothing.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.916
     Like any great teacher,
     I encourage my students

02:30.918 --> 02:32.818
            to seize the day!
          (CREAKING)

02:32.820 --> 02:34.019
              Aah!

02:34.021 --> 02:35.387
   <i> � I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:35.389 --> 02:39.558
    <i> � But nonetheless</i>
    <i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:41.462 --> 02:42.327
  <i> � I don't know the future</i>

02:42.329 --> 02:46.298
 <i> � But the past keeps getting</i>
 <i> clearer every day �</i>

02:46.300 --> 02:49.368
       ADULT ADAM:
      <i> It was January 4,</i>
      <i> 1980-something...</i>

02:49.370 --> 02:52.938
<i> the day a single text message</i>
<i> rocked my world.</i>

02:52.940 --> 02:53.739
                Yo.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.641
 Get this note
 to Goldnerd for me.

02:55.643 --> 02:56.742
     ADULT ADAM:
    <i> Yep, back in the '80s,</i>

02:56.744 --> 02:58.243
     <i> this was our version</i>
     <i> of sending a text.</i>

02:58.245 --> 03:01.613
<i> You'd have to pass a note the</i>
<i> old-fashioned way, by hand.</i>

03:01.615 --> 03:05.784
    <i> Only problem was,</i>
    <i> your messages weren't</i>
    <i> password-protected.</i>

03:05.786 --> 03:07.920
    Mr. Goldberg,
    since that little paper

03:07.922 --> 03:10.556
     is more important
     than life-saving CPR,

03:10.558 --> 03:14.359
 maybe you'd like to stand
 and share it
 with the rest of us.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.462
              "Ballsssss."

03:17.998 --> 03:19.698
             To be clear...

03:19.700 --> 03:21.633
         I did not write this.

03:22.069 --> 03:25.270
    "Dude, when did Emmy Mirsky
    get so dang foxy?

03:25.272 --> 03:28.540
      "I mean,
      holy boobs, Batman!
           (SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

03:28.542 --> 03:30.576
          "Look at those
          sweatshirt puppies."

03:30.578 --> 03:32.978
          Again,
          I did not write this.

03:32.980 --> 03:33.812
    Oh, that sucked.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.448
 My intention was to teach you
 a lesson about note-passing,

03:36.450 --> 03:39.151
 but instead, I just made us
 all feel wildly uncomfortable.

03:39.153 --> 03:42.721
 (CHUCKLES) Let's just
 move on to Chapter 6, okay?

03:43.224 --> 03:45.424
     Female reproductive...
     Nope.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.825
        Class dismissed.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.727
 Next time you get caught
 with a note,

03:48.729 --> 03:51.296
 just do what
 a normal person does
 and eat it.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.464
      Dude,
      you can't eat paper.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.966
       My mom says
       it plugs up your bottom.

03:53.968 --> 03:56.802
 Small price to pay
 to avoid total humiliation.

03:56.804 --> 03:57.536
         I know, right?

03:57.538 --> 03:59.438
      I had to stand up
      in front of everyone

03:59.440 --> 04:02.641
       and talk about
       my best friend's,
       you know, stuff.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.075
          Wait.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.310
 You thought that note
 was embarrassing for you?

04:05.312 --> 04:06.945
            Well, who else
            would it embarrass?

04:06.947 --> 04:07.746
         Me!
                Why?

04:07.748 --> 04:08.880
                The note said
                you were hot.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.082
            You should be happy
            about it.

04:10.084 --> 04:11.883
    Are you serious
    right now?

04:11.885 --> 04:13.418
 Dork!

04:13.420 --> 04:14.586
 Boy, you really know
 your way

04:14.588 --> 04:16.721
 around relationships
 with human beings.

04:16.724 --> 04:17.956
      I agree I'm flawed,

04:17.958 --> 04:20.993
    but I honestly have no idea
    what I said wrong here.

04:20.995 --> 04:21.994
                Okay, I'm gonna
                shed some light

04:21.995 --> 04:24.062
         on what it's like
         to be a freshman girl,

04:24.064 --> 04:25.330
             and it ain't gonna
             be pretty.

04:25.332 --> 04:28.533
          The seniors called me
          "Frizzica Spazzberg."

04:28.535 --> 04:30.936
       Every 9th-grade girl,
       no matter how she looks,

04:30.938 --> 04:32.504
            feels uncomfortable
            in her own skin.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.406
 There's a hunk of lettuce
 in your braces.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.307
 How did you not feel it?

04:35.309 --> 04:36.742
            I was going through
            a salad phase!

04:36.744 --> 04:38.677
       My point is,
       Emmy just needs a friend

04:38.679 --> 04:40.479
                who understands
                how she feels.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.046
       Seriously, though,

04:41.048 --> 04:42.848
   there's like a whole head
   of romaine in there.

04:42.850 --> 04:46.118
 I am gonna give you one second
 to walk away.

04:46.120 --> 04:46.351
                      One!

04:46.353 --> 04:48.153
  ADULT ADAM: <i> As I was learning</i>
<i> how to be a better friend,</i>

04:48.155 --> 04:51.223
 <i> my mom was teaching Barry</i>
 <i> how to be a better student.</i>

04:51.225 --> 04:52.057
            I don't understand!

04:52.059 --> 04:53.425
              This is my house,
              not my school.

04:53.427 --> 04:56.061
 Now that I have the teaching
 tools I learned in a movie,

04:56.063 --> 04:59.264
 I will not rest until
 you get an "A" in this class.

04:59.266 --> 05:02.701
 Okay, now,
 the atomic symbol "C"

05:02.703 --> 05:04.036
   stands for what?

05:04.038 --> 05:05.203
                Chemistry!
       Carbon.

05:05.205 --> 05:05.771
     It stands for Carbon.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.440
             But it also stands
             for chemistry,
             so half a point?

05:08.442 --> 05:11.343
 Okay. Name three types
 of inert gases.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.279
             Easy. There's
             regular, unleaded,

05:14.281 --> 05:16.415
               and...farts?

05:16.417 --> 05:17.716
           Farts?
                     Farts.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.384
 The answer is not farts!

05:19.386 --> 05:21.086
         How is fart not a gas?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.288
        Science makes no sense,
        and I don't need it!

05:23.290 --> 05:25.724
    Especially 'cause I'm gonna
    marry Kathy Ireland.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.026
  Who?
            Supermodel
            Kathy Ireland.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.028
    I'm gonna be
    her lazy mooch of a husband

05:30.030 --> 05:32.564
       who lives in her mansion
       in Ireland!

05:32.566 --> 05:33.799
      Now,
      if you'll excuse me,

05:33.801 --> 05:35.434
   I'm gonna go brush up
   on my Irish culture

05:35.436 --> 05:39.338
 and (BAD IRISH ACCENT)
 find me gold at the
 end of the rainbow, mon.

05:39.340 --> 05:42.641
       Well, that accent
       was definitely Jamaican.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.142
    Boopie, don't give up!

05:44.144 --> 05:45.811
     Mama believes in you!

05:45.813 --> 05:47.212
        Question. Why?

05:47.214 --> 05:48.113
 You're a substitute teacher.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.948
     Just give the boy
     a damn "A" already.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.350
         You want me to cheat?

05:51.352 --> 05:52.084
        Of course I do.

05:52.086 --> 05:54.586
 We got to get that moron
 into some sort of college.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.821
          Can you believe this,
          Dad?

05:55.823 --> 05:57.422
            He thinks Barry
            can't do it.

05:57.424 --> 05:58.857
    His answer was "farts."

05:58.859 --> 06:00.625
 Okay, you really want him
 to buckle down?

06:00.627 --> 06:02.394
    Let me go upstairs
    and get his ass in gear.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.763
       By yelling at him
       and calling him a moron?

06:04.765 --> 06:06.298
           No way.
           That doesn't work.

06:06.300 --> 06:07.399
       Barry needs inspiration.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.868
       All I need to do
       is unlock his potential,

06:09.870 --> 06:11.169
          and then
          the sky's the limit.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.605
      His many limits
      are the limit.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.640
   His answer was "farts."

06:15.642 --> 06:18.043
    ADULT ADAM: <i> That day,</i>
   <i> I was also on a mission</i>

06:18.045 --> 06:20.278
       <i> to prove to Emmy</i>
       <i> I felt her pain.</i>

06:20.280 --> 06:22.414
  All right,
  hormonal disasters!

06:22.416 --> 06:24.483
 It's time to pick teams!

06:24.485 --> 06:26.518
           Shirts, Skins,
           Shirts, Skins,

06:26.520 --> 06:28.720
 Shirts, Skins...
          Okay, so why exactly
          did we cut math

06:28.722 --> 06:30.389
              to sit in on some
              random gym class?

06:30.391 --> 06:31.189
 What you're witnessing

06:31.191 --> 06:34.526
 is a barbaric practice
 known as "Shirts vs. Skins."

06:34.528 --> 06:37.863
 Nothing is worse than
 having to awkwardly disrobe

06:37.865 --> 06:38.897
 in front of your bros.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.664
      You got to be kidding me.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.634
 I know! I mean,
 why not shorts vs. pants?

06:42.636 --> 06:44.269
        Or red shirts
        vs. blue shirts?

06:44.271 --> 06:46.938
 Sure, it would take some
 planning the night before,

06:46.940 --> 06:48.774
     but I could get
     a phone tree going.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.776
           I mean,
           we are not the same.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.744
            Do you wear thick,
            baggy-ass clothes

06:52.746 --> 06:55.347
       when it's 90 degrees out
       to hide your body?

06:55.349 --> 06:57.082
 I thought you wear that
 'cause you love Epcot.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.650
             I've never even
             been there!

06:58.652 --> 06:59.284
           Why would I love it?

06:59.286 --> 07:00.819
 'Cause it's like taking
 a trip around the world

07:00.821 --> 07:03.188
  without leaving
  the safe confines
  of Orlando?

07:03.190 --> 07:04.156
           Being a Skin in gym

07:04.158 --> 07:06.858
    is nothing compared
    to being stared at all day.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.493
     Well, if you
     think about it,

07:08.495 --> 07:09.795
    my thing's
    actually way worse

07:09.797 --> 07:13.165
  'cause at least you
  get to cover up with
  bulky fabrics.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.400
    I get no fabrics!
    None!

07:15.769 --> 07:18.136
          You're a douche lord!

07:19.940 --> 07:22.274
       Hey, Bar, how's studying
       with Mom going?

07:22.276 --> 07:22.941
 Rad as all get-out.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.510
 Only took two minutes
 to finish all of my homework.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.912
      She's really teaching you
      science stuff?

07:26.914 --> 07:30.749
 Let's just say Mom is gonna be
 very pleased with my answers.

07:30.751 --> 07:33.318
     (CHUCKLES)
     Pops, give us a taste.

07:33.320 --> 07:33.952
        Question one.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.888
 "What is the chemical symbol
 for sodium?"

07:36.890 --> 07:37.589
       And my answer?

07:37.591 --> 07:40.058
 "My mommy
 is the best mommy ever

07:40.060 --> 07:43.428
  "of all mommies
  on Planet Mommy."

07:43.430 --> 07:43.995
           Nailed it!

07:43.997 --> 07:45.497
   What the hell are you doing,
   you moron?

07:45.499 --> 07:46.231
    Just giving the lady

07:46.233 --> 07:47.933
   the answers
   she always wanted to hear.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.669
 Pops, what's the atomic weight
 of chloride?

07:50.671 --> 07:54.773
 "Wittle Barry-wary
 like Mummy's snuggy-wuggies."

07:54.775 --> 07:56.007
 Okay, this is just nonsense.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.677
   ADULT ADAM: <i> And with that,</i>
  <i> my dad knew it was time</i>

07:58.679 --> 08:00.912
       <i> to inspire Barry</i>
       <i> in his own way.</i>

08:00.914 --> 08:03.215
       Look,
       I hate to tell you this,

08:03.217 --> 08:07.319
    but your mom is looking
    for any excuse to fail you.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.420
          What? Why?

08:08.422 --> 08:11.623
       Mom telling you to study
       is just a trick,

08:11.625 --> 08:15.126
    because she knows
    you never do what she says.

08:15.128 --> 08:15.794
     I do don't do that!

08:15.796 --> 08:19.030
   She really wants you to fail
   so you don't graduate.

08:19.032 --> 08:22.467
         And no college means
         you live here forever.

08:22.469 --> 08:25.136
     And that means
     she picks out your clothes

08:25.138 --> 08:26.438
     for the rest of your life.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.472
   But I want Kathy Ireland

08:27.474 --> 08:29.007
    to pick out my clothes
    for the rest of my life.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.476
     Well, I hope she enjoys
     sharing a family bathroom.

08:31.478 --> 08:34.578
    No! She likes sushi
    and smoothies and Malibu!

08:34.581 --> 08:37.448
              I don't know
              what to tell you.
    Mom will not control me.

08:37.451 --> 08:39.183
  I will learn all chemistry...

08:39.186 --> 08:40.150
       No, all science!

08:40.153 --> 08:41.686
            Mom says you won't.
 Oh, I will.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.223
    Time for me to tear off
    this plastic shrink-wrap

08:45.225 --> 08:46.224
      and get to learning.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.259
 But the year is half-over.

08:47.261 --> 08:51.162
           And that, my friend,
           is how you truly
           inspire a kid.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.666
 All you did was use his mother
 as a weapon to rile him up.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.767
          I do it all the time.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.069
          It's how I got Erica
          to learn piano,

08:58.071 --> 08:58.703
           Adam to ice skate.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.172
           I just tell them
           that their mom is
           holding them back.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.508
 You do know that
 if Bev finds out about this,

09:03.510 --> 09:05.076
 she'll never forgive you.

09:05.078 --> 09:05.577
               No doubt.

09:05.579 --> 09:08.613
 Aw, screw it.
 You did what you had to do.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.251
  ADULT ADAM: <i> It had been days</i>
 <i> since Emmy talked to me,</i>

09:13.253 --> 09:16.054
     <i> so I decided to</i>
     <i> recruit someone who</i>
     <i> spoke her language.</i>

09:16.056 --> 09:19.524
 Okay, before you
 throw a hard object at me
 and say "Get out"...

09:19.526 --> 09:20.926
            Get out!

09:21.128 --> 09:22.761
      ...I have
      a big favor to ask,

09:22.763 --> 09:25.297
    and will pay a huge sum
    of money to do it.

09:25.299 --> 09:25.931
       I'm listening.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.465
 I need you to give
 this note to Emmy

09:27.467 --> 09:28.300
 and make her read it.

09:28.302 --> 09:29.334
           She's still not
           talking to you, huh?

09:29.336 --> 09:31.803
      Honestly, she's being
      crazy and irrational,

09:31.805 --> 09:33.038
       but as you can see
       in this note,

09:33.040 --> 09:35.974
       I'm the bigger man
       and still willing
       to apologize.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.877
       "Dear Emmy, you're being
       crazy and irrational.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.211
            "Let me explain
            the many reasons

09:40.213 --> 09:42.213
          "why your super-silly
          female body issues

09:42.215 --> 09:43.915
        "are all in your head."

09:43.917 --> 09:44.683
                    No.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.651
 Fine!
 Then, then you fix it.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.954
       Exactly how much money
       are we talking here?

09:48.956 --> 09:51.189
            $1,000.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.091
 Which is what this Megatron
 will be worth

09:53.093 --> 09:55.460
       on the black market
       in 30 years.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.595
       I'll do it for 20 bucks.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.429
   5 bucks and a Skeletor?

09:57.431 --> 09:59.030
       I'll do it
       if you just go away now.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.932
    ADULT ADAM: <i> And so</i>
   <i> my sister would help me,</i>

10:00.934 --> 10:02.534
  <i> but not by going to Emmy.</i>

10:02.536 --> 10:04.269
 Hey, Coach,
 got a minute?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.104
              Kind of busy,
              female Goldberg.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.006
    I'm inventing
    a new hybrid sport.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.875
 Either, uh, baseball fencing
 or water-polo squash.

10:10.877 --> 10:14.245
     You can't play
     squash under water.
     People need to breathe.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.047
      Need to breathe.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.016
              (SIGHS)
              That makes sense.

10:18.018 --> 10:22.153
         "Need to breathe."

10:22.155 --> 10:22.621
       Uh-huh.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.190
  So, my brother's been
  a bad friend to Emmy Mirsky.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.626
       Ah, stabbed in the back
       by her best <i> amigo.</i>

10:27.628 --> 10:31.329
  That is a crime worse than
  all the murders in the world.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.531
    I don't think
    that's right, but sure.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.635
   So, could you help her
   by blatantly abusing
   your authority?

10:36.637 --> 10:40.505
    You want old Coach to exact
    sweet revenge, huh?

10:40.507 --> 10:41.473
                 No problem.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.074
 You're an amazing teacher.

10:43.076 --> 10:43.541
               I'm sure of it.

10:43.543 --> 10:46.344
    ADULT ADAM:
   <i> While Erica was looking</i>
   <i> to teach me a lesson,</i>

10:46.346 --> 10:48.046
  <i> Barry was ready to learn.</i>

10:48.048 --> 10:48.713
                 JTP!
 ALL: JTP!

10:48.715 --> 10:52.817
     I need you to teach me
     everything about chemistry
     so I can get an "A."

10:52.819 --> 10:54.219
      Are you sure you want
      to join us, bro?

10:54.221 --> 10:57.188
  Yeah, you tend to just
  sort of peter out, insult us,

10:57.190 --> 10:58.156
              and then leave us
              high and dry.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.692
  Not this time, my tiny friend
  I can fit in my pocket!

11:00.694 --> 11:04.596
           I have enough anger
           in me to last for
           at least three days.

11:04.598 --> 11:05.730
               Let's do this!

11:05.732 --> 11:07.032
 What are you doing?

11:07.034 --> 11:08.433
            Taking photographs
            with my mind.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.502
     You mean memorizing?
             Done! Quiz me.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.836
              Fire away.
    Dude. (CHUCKLES)

11:11.838 --> 11:13.738
 It takes more than just
 glancing at our note cards

11:13.740 --> 11:16.808
     to know what elements
     are in Group Four of
     the Periodic Table.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.977
  Titanium, Zirconium, Hafnium,
  and Rutherfordium.

11:18.979 --> 11:22.113
 Whoa. When you've got
 hate in your heart,
 you're, like, crazy-smart.

11:22.115 --> 11:25.183
    Also, it totally proves
    you were never living up
    to your potential.

11:25.185 --> 11:25.817
              Indeed, Geoffrey.

11:25.819 --> 11:29.020
  And I will use that potential
  to stop my mom's evil plan.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.824
   ADULT ADAM: <i> And he did.</i>
  <i> Barry was so psyched</i>
  <i> to teach my mom a lesson,</i>

11:32.826 --> 11:35.326
      <i> he couldn't stop</i>
      <i> teaching himself.</i>

11:35.328 --> 11:36.695
 Well, look at
 you guys studying.

11:36.697 --> 11:40.432
        Just tutoring my boys.
        They're having
        a hard time keeping up.

11:40.434 --> 11:41.533
  Keeping up with you?

11:41.535 --> 11:44.002
     Turns out science just
     kind of clicks when I try.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.604
 Barry's even read
 four chapters ahead, for fun.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.474
         That's right. He knows
         stuff we can't even
         begin to comprehend.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.875
 Until we read that far
 into the book.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.311
       Thanks to you telling me
       about Mom's awful plan

11:53.313 --> 11:54.979
         to keep me here
         to love me forever.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.281
       You're really
       showing her.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.584
 Uh, just maybe you keep
 your rage-learning between us.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.852
          But what's the point
          of knowledge

12:00.854 --> 12:02.587
        if you don't use it
        to destroy your mother?

12:02.589 --> 12:04.522
   You know what would
   really stick it to her?

12:04.524 --> 12:07.058
  If you tell her after
  you got into college.

12:07.060 --> 12:07.726
           (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.662
   Imagine how miserable she'll
   be when I go off to Harvard.

12:10.664 --> 12:11.996
       You'll destroy her
       for sure.

12:11.998 --> 12:15.300
 But until then,
 let's just keep it our secret.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.134
  Our wonderful secret.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.536
      ADULT ADAM:
     <i> As my dad was trying</i>
     <i> to keep Barry quiet,</i>

12:18.538 --> 12:21.206
     <i> I was just trying</i>
     <i> to keep my shirt on.</i>

12:21.208 --> 12:22.640
       Shirt. Skin.

12:22.642 --> 12:25.643
 Shirt, Skin, Shirt, Skin,
 Shirt, Skin, Shirt.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.978
  Yes! I'm golden.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.279
             Shirt.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.481
                        Skin.

12:29.483 --> 12:30.415
 Skin.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.349
 Whoa. Hey, hang on!

12:31.351 --> 12:32.784
 This better be important,
 Goldfarb!

12:32.786 --> 12:34.352
           It is.
           You double-skinned.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.521
 Oh, how about that?
 I did double-skin.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.889
                But you can't
                double-skin.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.557
              It's Shirt, Skin,
              Shirt, Skin.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.192
   I can Skin-Skin
   anytime I like.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.994
      If you Skin-Skin, there's
      no rules! It's chaos!

12:42.996 --> 12:46.331
 Maybe now you'll know what
 it feels like to be a young
 girl coming of age!

12:46.333 --> 12:47.098
            Wait,
            is this about Emmy?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.601
 The best teachers never reveal
 if it's about Emmy.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.702
         So it is about Emmy!

12:50.704 --> 12:52.137
 You should have just
 eaten the note.

12:52.139 --> 12:52.837
 Everybody eats the note!

12:52.839 --> 12:54.839
     Why do people think eating
     paper is a viable option?

12:54.841 --> 12:57.308
 Just for the back-talk,
 you're a Skin
 for the rest of the week!

12:57.310 --> 12:58.910
                        No!
 Now you're a Skin
 for the rest of the year!

12:58.912 --> 13:01.946
 You keep it up,
 you'll be a Skin for life!
           You can't do that.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.248
 Trust me...
 On your wedding day,

13:03.250 --> 13:04.816
 you will walk down
 the aisle shirtless.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.651
           No respectable venue
           would allow that!

13:06.653 --> 13:08.253
 It'll be a beach wedding!
                  (GROANS)

13:08.255 --> 13:11.623
   That sounds wonderful
   and like my worst nightmare.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.258
    ADULT ADAM:
   <i> That was when I realized</i>

13:13.260 --> 13:16.127
   <i> the person</i>
   <i> I'd enlisted to help me</i>
   <i> only made it worse.</i>

13:16.129 --> 13:19.130
 You did this!
   You said you wanted my help,
   so I'm helping you.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.167
 I meant talk to her and make
 everything better for me.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.369
 Instead, you got Mellor
 all riled up!

13:24.371 --> 13:25.937
  You know
  he riles easily!

13:25.939 --> 13:27.372
            I wasn't just gonna
            bail you out.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.674
              You'd never learn
              if I did that.
     Learn what?

13:29.676 --> 13:32.710
    Do you know how hard it was
    for me to be Frizzica?

13:32.712 --> 13:34.846
        I used to eat lunch
        in the bathroom stalls.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.515
     I'd take the back hallways
     to avoid boys.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.417
        I even spent
        Saturday nights at home

13:39.419 --> 13:40.952
              watching the news
              with Dad.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.487
     He yells so much
     at the news.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.855
            It's like he thinks
            they can hear him!

13:43.857 --> 13:45.356
           But you want to know
           the worst part?

13:45.358 --> 13:48.159
     Is I had no one to talk to
     about any of it.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.861
                 But Emmy does.
                 She has you.

13:49.863 --> 13:53.464
      But you're only thinking
      about yourself instead of
      being there for her.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.465
       (WHISTLE BLOWING)

13:54.467 --> 13:56.134
 All right.
 Enough lesson-learning.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.368
  Shirt off.
  Get in the game.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.304
             You'll have
             to catch me first!

13:59.806 --> 14:01.973
  I'm athletic
  when determined.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.144
           (GROANS)
           I'm a Skin.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.883
              Boom!
              Read it and weep.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.818
   Read it to me.
   It hurts when I look down.

14:13.820 --> 14:17.622
   It's Barry's chemistry test,
   and guess what?
   He aced it!

14:17.624 --> 14:19.524
              Or should I say,
              I aced him!

14:19.526 --> 14:20.525
 Guess you did, huh?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.560
        No, you said I couldn't
        "Captain" him,

14:22.562 --> 14:24.229
            but you were wrong,
            sucka!

14:24.231 --> 14:25.330
   You showed me.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.031
       Attention,
       people in the room.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.500
       I have a huge
       announcement
       about my future

14:29.502 --> 14:31.135
      that I need to rub
      in my mother's face.

14:31.137 --> 14:34.672
       No, no, no. We said
       we were gonna be rubbing
       at a much later date.

14:34.674 --> 14:35.106
         I'm sorry, Dad.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.109
      I couldn't wait
      for Harvard to beg me
      to join their ranks.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.245
       This is too good.
       It must be rubbed.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.946
            Wait, did I hear
            "Harvard"?

14:41.948 --> 14:44.048
     I think I heard "Harvard."

14:44.050 --> 14:44.916
        Oh, you heard it.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.818
     Thanks to my newfound
     love of sciences,

14:46.820 --> 14:50.355
 I've officially decided
 what to do with my life.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.156
      I shall be a doctor.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.424
                (GASPS)

14:53.426 --> 14:54.626
      I give you the JTP.
                       ALL JTP!

14:54.628 --> 14:59.664
   Not the Jenkintown Posse.
   I'm talkin' about
   the Jenkintown Practice.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.666
        An all-in-one
        medical facility

15:01.668 --> 15:04.135
      where I'll be CEO
      and lead surgeon.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.670
     I'm the in-house
     ophthalmologist.

15:05.672 --> 15:06.704
   I'm the foot doc, y'all!

15:06.706 --> 15:07.872
      And I'ma play drums
      in the waiting room.

15:07.874 --> 15:11.476
           I cannot believe
           what I'm hearing!
           Tell me more!

15:11.478 --> 15:12.410
                 No. Let's not.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.912
  Sorry, Mom. You lose.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.447
            We've heard enough.
   I will succeed in life

15:16.449 --> 15:18.149
 just to spite you.
                       No!

15:18.151 --> 15:19.083
 What'chu have to say
 about that?

   This is the happiest (BLEEP)
   day of my (BLEEP) life!

15:23.023 --> 15:24.555
 What? Why is this good news?

15:24.557 --> 15:25.823
          'Cause I inspired you
          to learn!

15:25.825 --> 15:29.394
   Now, get up on
   that table and
   "O Captain! My Captain!" me.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.329
 But I thought you secretly
 wanted me to fail.

15:31.331 --> 15:35.566
         Of course not.
         Uh, who would give you
         such a nasty idea?

15:38.772 --> 15:39.804
              (YELPS)

15:39.806 --> 15:40.805
 Maybe we should go.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.073
         What the hell's
         happening here?

15:42.075 --> 15:44.475
          Ooh, I'd like to stay
          and quietly watch.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.611
            I may have slightly
            motivated the kid

15:46.613 --> 15:49.580
   using you as a springboard
   for his hate.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.249
              Yeah, you get it.
         Wait.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.919
    My mom genuinely
    wants me to thrive?
    This is horrible!

15:54.921 --> 15:59.390
          No, it's great!
          You love science now.
          We all win.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.892
   It's all built on lies!

16:00.894 --> 16:04.329
    I fully reject science
    and all learning!

   I'm sorry, JTP.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.832

   to help the kid succeed.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.879
                  To quit.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.581
               I'm no teacher.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.482
         And the worst part is,

16:24.484 --> 16:29.187
           the only thing
           I inspired in my son
           is resentment.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.281

     an appreciation
     for the arts.

          of a multi-hyphenate.

           I've been focusing
           on the written word.

        problem, dorknard?

             talking about
             my friend here.

 Dude! Go away, it's fine.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.858
          No, it's not! I mean,
          how would you feel

17:07.861 --> 17:09.460
     if every time
     you walked through school,

17:09.462 --> 17:10.762
             the girls talked
             about your body?

17:10.763 --> 17:13.297
  I'd nod and say,
  "This saddle seats one.

   "Unless you're a twin,
   then it seats two."

17:15.435 --> 17:18.970
            Point is, maybe
            we should just
            be more sensitive.

         to be a freshman

17:21.808 --> 17:23.941
     I'm hoping you can fit
     in that trash can.

                    Hey.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.231
  Please don't make
  a big deal out of this.

18:22.435 --> 18:26.938
   Wow. I get a hug even though
   I made you a Skin for life?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.806
        You also just saved it.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.108
  I'm your big sis.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.943
     That's what
     I'm here for.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.245
               I'm gonna
               hug you again.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.680
  Do it and you die.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.215
 No, I...

     ADULT ADAM: <i> Sometimes,</i>
    <i> we're so consumed</i>

18:42.956 --> 18:45.656

18:45.658 --> 18:50.428
    <i> until we open our eyes</i>

18:50.430 --> 18:52.130
            Dude! Knock first!

18:52.132 --> 18:54.031
   What'd you put
   under the mattress?

18:54.033 --> 18:54.999
                  Magazine.

18:55.001 --> 18:57.201
              Dirty kind
              with lady parts.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.171
  Physics?
               (SIGHS)

19:00.173 --> 19:01.806
                    Fine.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.974
        Look, I love science.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.576
          I'm good at it,
          and I feel ashamed.

19:05.578 --> 19:08.980
    Well, don't.
    I'm proud of you.

19:08.982 --> 19:09.380
                  You are?

19:09.382 --> 19:12.517
 Look, it was wrong to use
 your mother against you,

19:12.519 --> 19:16.821
  but now we know
  how much you can do
  if you actually try.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.589
              Yeah. Who knew?

19:18.591 --> 19:21.559
 I'll tell you who knew.
 Beverly Goldberg.

19:21.561 --> 19:25.096
   She believed in you
   the whole time.

19:25.098 --> 19:26.497
               I guess she is
               a good teacher.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.534
   And she's also
   a damn-good mother.

19:29.536 --> 19:33.271
 And maybe it wouldn't hurt
 if you let her know.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.874
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
             (WHISTLE BLOWS)

19:36.876 --> 19:38.943
         All right!
         Quiet down!

19:38.945 --> 19:40.311
    I'm your substitute sub,

19:40.313 --> 19:43.281
     which means study hall
     for a month!

19:43.283 --> 19:47.451
 Sorry to interrupt.
 I just came to get my mug.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.655
              Wait! Mom!

19:56.095 --> 19:57.662
           O Captain!
           My Captain!

19:57.664 --> 19:58.529
         Sit down,
         Mr. Goldberg!

19:58.531 --> 20:03.267
    On behalf of me
    and the rest
    of the Jenkintown Practice,

20:03.269 --> 20:05.703
        thank you
        for believing in us.

20:06.039 --> 20:06.971
           And in me.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.807
        I said sit down,
        Mr. Goldberg!

20:10.343 --> 20:11.642
       O Captain! My Captain!

20:11.644 --> 20:12.977
   O Captain! My Captain!

20:12.979 --> 20:13.511
         O Captain! My Captain!

20:13.513 --> 20:15.746
      What'd I say about
      standing on the desks?
      Everybody down!

20:15.748 --> 20:18.849
      Dude, they're sticking it
      to Mellor by standing
      on school property!

20:18.851 --> 20:21.152
        I'm king of
        whatever class this is!

20:21.154 --> 20:23.254
             This school sucks!
          Screw you, Dad!

20:23.256 --> 20:25.122
             Rush rules!
              I will never die!

20:25.124 --> 20:28.526
  ADULT ADAM: <i> Turns out,</i>
<i> Beverly Goldberg was way more</i>

20:28.528 --> 20:30.661
    <i> than just</i>
    <i> a substitute teacher.</i>

20:30.663 --> 20:33.531
<i> She was permanent inspiration.</i>

20:33.533 --> 20:36.033
    My baby's
    gonna be a doctor.

20:36.035 --> 20:39.470
     Eh, I'll believe that
     when I see it.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.573
          (APPLAUSE)
              (DING)

20:42.575 --> 20:44.475
 ADAM: Dad, say something.
 How do you feel?

20:44.477 --> 20:45.810
     I am so proud and happy.

20:45.812 --> 20:49.247
   Now that he's gonna be going
   to medical school,

20:49.249 --> 20:50.081
           I cried like a baby.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.849
        Because that means
        for another four years,

20:51.851 --> 20:52.984
        he'll still be
        out of the house

20:52.986 --> 20:56.254
               and we can keep
               the room neat.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.957
   And that is how
   you perform CPR on a man.

20:59.959 --> 21:03.694
 Whoa, Mr. Goldberg,
 what is that you have there?

21:03.696 --> 21:04.929
 Is that another note?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.030
             What? You just...

21:06.032 --> 21:06.497
     You know the rule.

21:06.499 --> 21:09.066
 If you get caught with a note,
 you have to stand up
 and read it out loud

21:09.068 --> 21:10.868
 so that everybody
 can hear it.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.604
   "Hey, Adam.
   Who's your favorite teacher?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.406
                "I know mine's

             "He's hip like us.
             Dude just gets it.

21:17.410 --> 21:21.479
         "Did you know he's
         in a funk-fusion band
         called Funk and Games?

21:21.481 --> 21:24.382
 "I heard he's playing at the
 farmer's market this weekend."

21:24.384 --> 21:27.385
         I can't read any more.
         I'm just gonna eat it.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.187
  You can't eat paper!
  It'll plug you up!
