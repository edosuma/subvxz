oscillator is no longer in my possession.

20:19.219 --> 20:22.806
Well, then deactivate it
before it blows us all to bits.

20:23.098 --> 20:27.603
Revelation:
Your concern for all of us is misplaced.

20:27.853 --> 20:32.482
- The bomb only irradiates organic tissue.
- You backstabbing-

20:32.774 --> 20:37.362
Robot? It's true, I do hate all humans.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.114
Whichever world is destroyed...

20:39.364 --> 20:43.493
...I look forward to an empty planet
to call my own.

20:47.748 --> 20:50.125
Who's broken now, Cyclone?

21:02.221 --> 21:04.139
- Ready?
RED HOOD: Ready.

21:20.656 --> 21:24.785
- Where to?
- Earth 161 . Zombie planet.

21:25.077 --> 21:26.578
Can't be killed.

21:33.835 --> 21:38.507
You started something today:
a brave, bold new era in crime-fighting.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.300
RED HOOD:
Whoever he is...

21:40.550 --> 21:44.263
...I hope my counterpart on your world
will have a chance to repay you.

21:44.263 --> 21:46.306
Somehow that seems unlikely.

21:49.768 --> 21:52.604
Oh, and expect
an Owlman-shaped package momentarily.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.620
BATMAN:
Gotham. There's no place like--

22:15.335 --> 22:17.004
[HELICOPTER WHIRRING OVERHEAD]

22:18.046 --> 22:21.008
[SIRENS WAILING]

22:22.217 --> 22:24.303
Hands up, Batman. You're under arrest.
