00:05.329 --> 00:07.079
These are bitemarks, Reid.

00:08.122 --> 00:09.987
Isaac did not do this thing.

00:10.741 --> 00:14.318
The true killer is still walking
the streets you once knew as home.

00:14.969 --> 00:17.736
Please, please, Connor.
It is for the best.

00:17.747 --> 00:19.856
A song, Rose. He likes a song.

00:26.149 --> 00:28.522
- It is a song, Bennet.
- No, Rose.

00:28.533 --> 00:31.526
You think you can hide such
a truth from me. You cannot!

00:32.265 --> 00:35.579
And the man, Bloom, that matter is shut.

00:37.209 --> 00:39.265
_

00:41.266 --> 00:44.916
Thomas Gower, you will be
taken to the gallows at Newgate.

00:44.927 --> 00:46.725
You get him away, far away.

00:47.082 --> 00:48.282
- Go!
- _

00:48.293 --> 00:49.528
- Oh, he can fight,
- _

00:49.539 --> 00:50.884
- make no mistake of that.
- _

00:50.895 --> 00:52.095
You're saving me?

00:52.106 --> 00:57.720
Where you go to, all you've yet known
will seem no more than a Sunday fair.

Tanner!

01:38.617 --> 01:41.246
Yes, yes!

01:42.220 --> 01:43.962
Work. Work with him.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.570
- Tanner!
- Charlie, my boy, run!

01:53.945 --> 01:57.583
Tanner, cross it. I'm here!

01:57.594 --> 01:59.005
Tanner, now!

01:59.912 --> 02:01.120
Tanner!

02:01.483 --> 02:04.017
Tanner!

02:18.079 --> 02:19.808
That was mine, you greedy wanker.

02:19.809 --> 02:21.952
Come on, Will. We got
the goal, didn't we?

02:22.134 --> 02:23.685
You got it.

_

03:42.695 --> 03:47.807
Now, I know it ain't
mint juleps at the Savoy

03:47.818 --> 03:50.821
or waltzing at the Holborn, but...

03:54.222 --> 03:56.554
I figured it was the next best thing.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.888
Maybe go easy on the waltzing.

04:11.772 --> 04:13.978
Thank you for this, Matthew.

04:14.882 --> 04:17.495
You know I can't abide a caged bird.

04:27.592 --> 04:29.873
Ain't it always been this, though,

04:30.116 --> 04:31.820
life in the shadows,

04:33.036 --> 04:37.527
world shaking its sweet
glitter just out of reach.

04:39.668 --> 04:43.294
- We've got to get out of here.
- I know.

04:51.483 --> 04:52.849
What, Matthew?

04:58.867 --> 05:02.981
You know that I'd throw the dice with
you any day, Caitlin. You know that.

05:03.699 --> 05:07.237
Me and you, we run
till the stars burn out.

05:07.682 --> 05:11.840
For better or worse, we chose this life.

05:15.657 --> 05:20.729
But the boy, he didn't.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.866
This ain't the life I want for Connor.

05:26.440 --> 05:30.072
With Drake, the boy has a home.

05:30.083 --> 05:31.548
He's safe.

05:32.281 --> 05:34.733
- He's loved.
- I love him.

05:36.344 --> 05:39.461
We will go to the
ends of Earth, Matthew,

05:39.472 --> 05:42.131
so far that no one
will ever come looking.

05:44.709 --> 05:47.957
This isn't just you and me anymore.

05:48.942 --> 05:53.588
We are a family, and I will
not leave without my son.

05:58.615 --> 06:00.043
I hear you, darling.

06:18.970 --> 06:20.685
What business, sirs?

06:22.621 --> 06:24.158
Are you foreman here?

06:24.232 --> 06:27.197
Felix Hackman, and who asks it?

06:31.217 --> 06:32.417
This way.

06:44.008 --> 06:46.699
Charlie Tanner, he work for you?

06:46.710 --> 06:47.910
He does.

06:48.145 --> 06:49.694
Except he's late today.

06:49.912 --> 06:52.495
Mr. Hackman, Charlie Tanner is dead.

06:54.599 --> 06:55.981
He's, ah...

06:57.171 --> 06:58.379
Charlie?

06:58.390 --> 07:02.013
Found in his room beaten with a hammer.

07:06.296 --> 07:08.813
- He was well known to you?
- Well enough.

07:11.007 --> 07:13.946
Took on Charlie Tanner
some 10 years past.

07:13.957 --> 07:16.298
He was a muckscrap, a street run,

07:16.309 --> 07:19.566
filching pockets and sucking
gin like it was mother's milk.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.163
These ironworks forged a man of him.

07:22.249 --> 07:25.653
And do you often recruit such
muckscraps to your foundry?

07:27.715 --> 07:30.239
We take in all sorts at the ironworks,

07:30.668 --> 07:35.732
give them purpose, discipline, teach
them honest work and temperance.

07:35.743 --> 07:38.252
- Temperance?
- Oh, I insist on it, sir.

07:38.465 --> 07:40.742
None of my boys is weak
for grape nor grain.

07:40.753 --> 07:43.977
They live, work, sport as men of iron.

07:43.988 --> 07:45.599
You train the football team here?

07:45.610 --> 07:46.810
I do.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.625
I've seen your boys play. Reckon
they might take the league this year.

07:51.299 --> 07:52.499
Yeah.

07:55.321 --> 07:56.730
St. Sebastian?

07:57.353 --> 07:59.341
Patron Saint of athletes.

07:59.759 --> 08:01.787
Didn't watch over
Charlie, though, did he?

08:03.947 --> 08:07.384
Charlie Tanner was my best
ironsmith and my best player.

08:07.395 --> 08:09.903
Would all these men
speak so highly of him?

08:10.542 --> 08:12.798
Groups of young men are
seldom without their grudges

08:12.799 --> 08:14.246
and rivalries, Mr. Hackman.

08:14.257 --> 08:16.794
None of my boys would do in Charlie.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.517
He was their brother.

08:19.142 --> 08:21.205
He was a hero in this foundry.

08:21.309 --> 08:23.262
Even so, we will need to speak to them.

08:26.174 --> 08:27.924
You heard the Inspector.

08:28.324 --> 08:30.366
Any of you know ought
that might help him?

08:30.554 --> 08:32.287
Them gasworks bastards.

08:32.298 --> 08:34.905
- Yeah. That's right.
- What's that, lad?

08:36.980 --> 08:40.991
- The gasworks, they've always hated us.
- Yeah, truth, true.

08:41.003 --> 08:43.764
We beat them every time,
then they try to batter us.

08:44.519 --> 08:48.145
Me and Charlie get it the
worst for being the best.

08:48.877 --> 08:52.148
Wren's right. We played the
gasworks athletic yesterday.

08:52.149 --> 08:54.157
There was a fracas.

08:54.559 --> 08:56.670
You'd do well to bang
up all them animals.

08:56.681 --> 08:58.782
Yeah,
that's right. All true.

08:59.046 --> 09:01.974
All right. Back to work.
Iron don't forge itself.

09:03.181 --> 09:05.488
Here, a register of names.

09:06.733 --> 09:08.619
And that lad who spoke up just now?

09:08.630 --> 09:10.093
Yeah, Wilbur Wren.

09:15.279 --> 09:16.502
Gower.

09:18.269 --> 09:19.839
Thomas Gower.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.395
Not an uncommon name, Thomas Gower.

09:24.476 --> 09:25.685
True enough.

09:25.696 --> 09:28.508
Why should the Gower we
knew, who killed as a boy

09:28.509 --> 09:31.297
and only escaped the rope by
our mercy, return to Whitechapel.

09:31.308 --> 09:35.067
Whitechapel has as a way of drawing
back those who thought it left behind,

09:35.078 --> 09:36.506
does it not, Mr. Reid?

09:44.361 --> 09:45.561
Thomas Gower?

09:48.919 --> 09:50.119
Sir.

09:52.447 --> 09:53.650
It is you.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.845
I wasn't sure you'd recall me.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.347
Oh, I recall you often,

09:57.797 --> 10:01.172
wondering if you'd thank me or curse
me for putting you on that ship,

10:01.631 --> 10:04.127
whether the Army had
made you or destroyed you.

10:05.016 --> 10:06.900
Lance Corporal Gower, Sergeant.

10:06.911 --> 10:08.647
British South Africa Company.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.003
We're a long way from South Africa.

10:12.482 --> 10:16.095
Honourable discharge,
even gave me a medal.

10:16.585 --> 10:19.438
Stepped off a steamer
not three months past.

10:19.439 --> 10:23.980
Thought to call on you, but
I needed work and lodgings.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.675
Which you found, I see. Honest work.

10:28.866 --> 10:30.275
What you done for me,

10:31.302 --> 10:36.653
both of you, sirs, it changed me.

10:39.041 --> 10:40.548
I'm not how I was no more.

10:40.715 --> 10:42.016
Let us hope so.

10:43.668 --> 10:45.196
The man ain't the boy.

10:46.374 --> 10:48.263
You should be proud of yourself, lad.

10:52.969 --> 10:55.288
Was Charlie Tanner a friend of yours?

10:55.487 --> 10:56.688
Not so much.

10:56.868 --> 10:58.486
Football all stick with their own.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.782
He was decent, though, Charlie Tanner.

11:02.519 --> 11:03.994
I hope you do right by him.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.395
Now, I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

11:08.406 --> 11:12.482
and say Tanner was
maybe killed by a hammer,

11:12.493 --> 11:15.632
you know, to the head.

11:16.832 --> 11:19.291
Ah, some days, I can't
believe they pay me for this.

11:19.569 --> 11:21.490
Thatcher, get to the gasworks.

11:21.501 --> 11:24.239
I want a list of names on the football
team and everyone watching the match.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.450
Yes, sir.

11:26.099 --> 11:29.385
This hammered footballer, have
you used your fingerprint method?

11:29.396 --> 11:30.596
Yeah, I'm getting to it.

11:34.399 --> 11:35.916
Better school up, Reid.

11:36.461 --> 11:38.808
There's always the chance
I tell the head of division

11:38.819 --> 11:42.707
to shove his forensicating up his
sanctimonious self-righteous ass.

11:42.957 --> 11:45.127
Jackson, we had an agreement.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.390
Sang a song to my boys, huh?

11:47.401 --> 11:49.693
At the insistence of your goddamn wife.

11:49.703 --> 11:52.321
I made it clear to you this
discussion was concluded.

11:57.009 --> 12:00.141
Don't worry, Benito. I
ain't getting any ideas.

12:01.059 --> 12:02.874
Just do your job, man.

12:04.749 --> 12:07.439
I miss the days we
used to push him around.

12:09.599 --> 12:14.610
He was in my house with the boy,
and with my wife, unbeknownst to me,

12:14.621 --> 12:17.040
after he had made a vow
to leave the little one be.

12:17.050 --> 12:19.548
I do not disagree that the
American possesses an abundance

12:19.549 --> 12:23.273
of odious qualities. My
concern is only that his skill

12:23.284 --> 12:24.746
should remain an instrument to us.

12:24.757 --> 12:26.579
Connor may be Jackson's flesh and blood,

12:26.590 --> 12:28.732
but he is now my responsibility.

12:28.819 --> 12:31.558
And I will not see the
child confused and disturbed.

12:31.569 --> 12:34.580
As I said, Mr. Drake, my concern is
that antagonism between the two of you

12:34.591 --> 12:36.576
little serves our work here.

12:37.709 --> 12:39.408
Well, I thank you for your counsel

12:39.409 --> 12:41.874
on the running of both my
police station and my family.

12:44.348 --> 12:45.548
Yes?

12:48.178 --> 12:49.538
That'll be all, Mr. Reid.

12:53.431 --> 12:55.483
Take a seat. Come.

13:05.124 --> 13:06.513
There's things I...

13:07.997 --> 13:11.847
things you should
hear, Sergeant, but I...

13:12.714 --> 13:14.667
I could not speak out at the factory.

13:16.769 --> 13:19.188
Well, you may speak in
this room as you like, lad.

13:20.849 --> 13:23.907
I ain't a snitch. I've been a snitch.

13:24.843 --> 13:26.053
I remember.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.383
Charlie and Wilbur Wren, see?

13:34.945 --> 13:40.468
Ah, they played on the team
together, both strikers, but...

13:41.039 --> 13:43.543
they was at each other always.

13:43.826 --> 13:46.303
And Wilbur hated being
in Charlie's shadow.

13:46.739 --> 13:51.850
He's good, see, but
Charlie was always better.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.158
And at the gasworks
game, it all went off.

13:56.159 --> 13:58.420
Wilbur went for Charlie like an animal.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.995
And now Charlie's gone.

14:01.329 --> 14:03.390
Wilbur ain't in his shadow no more.

14:04.019 --> 14:06.005
He'll be skipper of the Ironworks.

14:07.819 --> 14:09.768
Hackman spoke nought of this.

14:09.959 --> 14:12.229
All Hackman cares about is the team.

14:13.399 --> 14:14.618
He lives for it.

14:23.669 --> 14:26.574
Send a constable. I want
Wilbur Wren brought in.

14:29.549 --> 14:30.862
Thomas, thank you.

14:35.799 --> 14:36.999
Wait, lad.

14:37.837 --> 14:41.824
Ah, my wife is cooking
pie tonight, pigeon.

14:42.079 --> 14:48.738
And, um, well, we've room at
our table, if you're hungry.

14:51.021 --> 14:52.489
Thank you, Mr. Drake.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.257
One, two, three, four.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.878
There's no mention of mulberry
silk in your manifest, Abel.

15:35.879 --> 15:39.267
Well, some things do not
need manifesting, old girl.

15:40.159 --> 15:41.617
Liberated, is it?

15:42.713 --> 15:46.227
From Her Majesty's customs
house to the House of Croker?

15:46.739 --> 15:49.048
Wish me to have a gown cut for you?

15:49.049 --> 15:50.249
I might.

15:51.009 --> 15:52.562
How do you do it, Abel?

15:53.144 --> 15:54.934
Do you simply send Nathaniel here

15:54.945 --> 15:57.880
over to the warehouse on Cutler
Street with a note of request?

16:01.809 --> 16:04.508
The Queen's duty must be paid
on all imports, must it not?

16:04.949 --> 16:06.178
Quite so.

16:06.179 --> 16:09.447
What else languishes there,
waiting that tax to be paid?

16:09.729 --> 16:12.085
What else might be matched to my gown?

16:12.879 --> 16:17.707
Gloves, shoes, jewellery?

16:19.878 --> 16:21.608
Never you mind, my girl.

16:21.619 --> 16:23.570
Oh, come, Abel. It is only curiosity.

16:23.581 --> 16:25.418
No, princess.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.978
With you it is never only nothing.

16:27.979 --> 16:30.389
Put that cat's nose of yours away.

16:31.558 --> 16:35.027
Nate, see this is
parked from prying eyes.

17:01.674 --> 17:05.830
Thought I might join you a
moment, watch the sun go down.

17:20.159 --> 17:21.700
Call it skimming, I believe.

17:24.659 --> 17:25.858
I shan't tell.

17:32.799 --> 17:35.527
Besides, I can't see
him punishing you for it.

17:37.980 --> 17:40.515
He loves you altogether
too much for that.

17:50.359 --> 17:51.711
Made me his own.

17:57.158 --> 17:59.260
There's nothing before him.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.972
Would have died without his care.

18:08.077 --> 18:10.002
That is love, Nathaniel.

18:14.199 --> 18:16.580
I would be dead without his care also.

18:17.999 --> 18:19.511
You pay him, however.

18:19.929 --> 18:21.425
You return that love.

18:23.789 --> 18:25.732
I have watched all you do for him.

18:26.229 --> 18:28.545
No son could ever do more.

18:29.438 --> 18:32.268
It is you gains access to
the customs house, is it not?

18:34.639 --> 18:37.552
That is some skill.

18:38.958 --> 18:42.724
I wonder might you show me?

18:44.775 --> 18:48.018
Show me how you manage
what no other can.

18:50.571 --> 18:54.411
Show me just how brave
and quick-witted you are.

19:07.417 --> 19:11.588
Three months I was besieged, men, women,

19:11.589 --> 19:15.066
kiddies, starving, dying.

19:15.452 --> 19:16.660
Where was the relief?

19:16.671 --> 19:18.918
Well, we was stationed
out on the Transvaal, see?

19:18.919 --> 19:23.067
Hundreds of miles we roamed...
hostile country, swamp, dune,

19:23.538 --> 19:25.595
but we reached Bulawayo, we did.

19:26.219 --> 19:28.006
Gunned the lot of them to the hills.

19:28.419 --> 19:30.600
Stamped on their mat bellies like rats.

19:32.799 --> 19:34.046
Queen and country.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.528
Thank you, Mrs. Drake.

19:37.529 --> 19:39.686
I never did smell a pie so good.

19:40.659 --> 19:44.806
Thomas, would you care for some wine
with your pie? Or a beer, perhaps?

19:44.817 --> 19:46.438
The lad's teetotal, Rose.

19:46.439 --> 19:48.298
All of us at the factory, Mrs. Drake.

19:48.299 --> 19:50.568
Temperance or else.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.646
How do you like the ironworks?

19:58.059 --> 19:59.786
I like it good enough, sir.

20:00.559 --> 20:02.865
But I wanna learn a trade, see?

20:03.299 --> 20:07.917
Soldiering, it's, ah... well, it's
killing people. It ain't helping them.

20:08.297 --> 20:10.736
You helped them people that
were sieged in Bulawayo.

20:10.747 --> 20:12.009
Only by killing.

20:14.583 --> 20:18.972
I, er... I-I wanna be a... a useful man.

20:19.301 --> 20:22.197
I've been helping at the
orphanage, Miss Deborah stays,

20:22.216 --> 20:23.578
odd jobs and that.

20:23.579 --> 20:26.758
- She must be very proud of you, Thomas.
- I hope.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.013
Miss Deborah's always been kind to me.

20:29.348 --> 20:31.147
She's closest to a ma I ever had.

20:33.949 --> 20:36.259
- Bennet.
- Leave the boy, Rose.

20:37.659 --> 20:39.165
Forging iron's honest work.

20:39.469 --> 20:42.906
- What about policing, Thomas?
- Excuse me.

20:46.129 --> 20:49.084
You're a Whitechapel boy, same as me.

20:49.475 --> 20:53.578
Raised on these black streets and
saved from them by the Army, same as me.

20:53.589 --> 20:55.465
- Mr. Drake, sir, I'm not...
- You'd work your way

20:55.476 --> 20:59.634
from the bottom, as did I. But
look where I've worked to, eh?

21:00.229 --> 21:02.429
Why should you not work thus also?

21:03.571 --> 21:05.841
Men like you, I could
police this borough clean.

21:05.852 --> 21:08.321
Mr. Drake, please, I'm not...

21:10.713 --> 21:13.212
I do not think I'm made for policing.

21:16.139 --> 21:19.480
You are made of stronger stuff
than you know, Thomas Gower.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.481
You think on it.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.698
Rise and shine, Wilbur Wren.

21:53.699 --> 21:55.562
I've been looking for you everywhere.

21:56.179 --> 21:58.426
I swear I paid for 'em this time.

22:05.756 --> 22:08.026
What chance of tincture for my head?

22:08.489 --> 22:09.925
It feels like a French toilet.

22:09.936 --> 22:12.755
No chance, boy. Not a ghost of one.

22:17.019 --> 22:19.688
Charlie Tanner was a sanctimonious prick

22:19.689 --> 22:22.142
with his nose right up Hackman's ass.

22:23.169 --> 22:26.908
I hated him, but I never killed him.

22:26.909 --> 22:31.173
You attacked him on the pitch,
busted his nose, so I hear.

22:31.429 --> 22:32.629
Horseplay.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.009
Horseplay?

22:34.333 --> 22:35.704
And going to his place afterwards

22:35.715 --> 22:38.218
to finish the job with a hammer,
that horseplay too, was it?

22:38.230 --> 22:40.219
Heck no. I went to a gin shop.

22:40.549 --> 22:43.131
Then I went home,
just me and the bottle.

22:43.142 --> 22:45.487
Bottle is poor alibi.

22:45.709 --> 22:48.393
It's only on the bottle-hugger's
word I'm here, ain't it?

22:50.224 --> 22:52.790
You think I don't know it
was Gower what burgled to you?

22:52.801 --> 22:54.856
You said bottle-hugger.

22:55.969 --> 22:58.183
I might like a drop or two, but Gower,

22:58.945 --> 23:01.371
Gower's a royal class
steam-powered pisshead.

23:01.382 --> 23:03.601
Thomas Gower is a decorated
lancer corporal, boy,

23:03.612 --> 23:05.056
and you'll show some respect.

23:05.067 --> 23:06.889
Never shuts his bloody
gob about it either,

23:06.900 --> 23:08.630
what he done in the Army.

23:09.049 --> 23:10.480
Gower the hero?

23:10.997 --> 23:12.245
Who cares?

23:12.765 --> 23:16.391
He might be decorated,
don't make him sober.

23:25.119 --> 23:26.738
Yeah, no dice.

23:27.699 --> 23:30.464
I'm not gonna be able to
get a clean print off that.

23:33.109 --> 23:35.368
I want Jackson to take
a look at Tanner's room.

23:35.369 --> 23:37.258
My money says Wren was there.

23:39.601 --> 23:41.454
And what does your money say, Reid?

23:49.509 --> 23:52.139
You heard the man. Get to your work.

23:59.959 --> 24:02.263
Charlie Tanner was found here, huh?

24:02.802 --> 24:04.557
Your wizardry ever astounds.

24:06.869 --> 24:10.247
There's a doctor,
Piotrowski. He's a pollack.

24:10.258 --> 24:11.898
He has a theory that you can analyse

24:11.899 --> 24:15.707
the pattern of a spatter
or reconstruct the trauma.

24:18.331 --> 24:19.804
And does it work?

24:20.823 --> 24:22.783
Hard to say. His research
was mostly beatin'

24:22.794 --> 24:24.878
rabbits to death and
looking at the mess.

24:24.879 --> 24:28.177
Photographs here, here, here,

24:28.402 --> 24:30.866
and... here.

24:32.399 --> 24:34.105
- Oof!
- What?

24:34.859 --> 24:37.423
Now, remember, Charlie
Tanner wasn't a drinker.

24:37.489 --> 24:40.088
Liver I pulled out of
him, pink as a baby's.

24:40.089 --> 24:42.578
On account of which,
he had a house guest.

24:42.579 --> 24:43.942
Take a huff.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.274
Cheap gin and piss.

24:46.809 --> 24:48.368
Temperance my ass.

24:48.369 --> 24:50.936
Tanner weren't a
drinker. Wilbur Wren was.

24:52.009 --> 24:53.366
Not only Wren.

24:53.948 --> 24:56.955
And it wasn't Wilbur Wren to
whom Tanner would offer his bed.

24:57.122 --> 25:00.273
Mr. Drake, you cannot
overlook Thomas Gower's past.

25:00.284 --> 25:02.491
No man deserves to be
judged on what he was.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.648
It is the one hope we have
to make ourselves better.

25:04.659 --> 25:07.885
I only suggest that Thomas Gower may not
have been as forthcoming as you suppose.

25:07.896 --> 25:09.980
Your suggestion is duly noted.

25:11.384 --> 25:14.564
Hey, Thatcher, once these two
are done swinging their handbags,

25:14.575 --> 25:15.775
bring the camera.

25:17.438 --> 25:18.786
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

25:37.898 --> 25:41.025
Is your boy Wren missing
a shirt, or your boy Gower?

25:47.112 --> 25:48.312
This Miss Castello?

25:48.323 --> 25:49.523
Yes. Just here.

25:52.180 --> 25:55.241
Really, it was as if he believes
I might shatter into pieces

25:55.252 --> 25:57.468
by letting him take me in his arms.

25:57.469 --> 26:00.702
Your strong sergeant, he is
altogether too well-mannered.

26:00.713 --> 26:03.477
He considers such manners
virtuous, I believe.

26:03.488 --> 26:06.570
Well, perhaps it is for you
to take an axe to that virtue.

26:08.462 --> 26:10.511
Deborah, good morning.

26:10.522 --> 26:11.728
Miss Reid, hello.

26:11.739 --> 26:13.124
Good morning, Miss Goren.

26:14.699 --> 26:18.338
I find myself somewhat adrift
from own my family, Mathilda.

26:18.339 --> 26:22.301
And so dear Deborah adds me to the
tally of those to whom she brings care.

26:22.312 --> 26:24.492
She does not eat. Someone must make her.

26:27.609 --> 26:30.178
Miss Rachel, I think,
I must be about my day.

26:30.361 --> 26:32.664
But again, I'm grateful
for your counsel.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.386
You're entirely welcome, Mathilda.

26:45.409 --> 26:46.855
What, Deborah?

26:47.229 --> 26:49.488
She's 19, and lives
alone with her father,

26:49.499 --> 26:53.123
and has met her first
darling boy. A policeman also,

26:53.134 --> 26:55.099
- if you believe that.
- I believe it.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.908
I believe you're also only
too keen to win her friendship,

26:57.919 --> 26:59.915
given the identity of her father.

27:00.889 --> 27:05.161
Do you know Mr. Reid still keeps a copy
of the Ratovski case file in his home.

27:05.329 --> 27:08.245
It seems your Isaac Bloom still
weighs heavy upon his conscience.

27:08.256 --> 27:11.642
And this you established through
the manipulation of the daughter.

27:15.939 --> 27:18.366
I think you must leave Mathilda Reid

27:18.377 --> 27:19.629
- be, Rachel.
- Deborah.

27:19.630 --> 27:22.101
You do not know the half
of what she has suffered.

27:22.179 --> 27:24.338
If you want to be her friend,
then you be her friend,

27:24.349 --> 27:26.202
but I will not see her used.

27:26.869 --> 27:28.426
Then I am sorry.

27:28.819 --> 27:30.177
Forgive me, Deborah.

27:30.926 --> 27:32.126
Forgive me.

27:33.289 --> 27:35.199
But I wonder, might you help me?

27:39.729 --> 27:41.359
They are from Paris.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.147
They are Ratovski's diaries.

27:59.249 --> 28:01.968
Wren says that the shirt ain't his.

28:01.969 --> 28:03.668
Ain't that a kick in the head.

28:11.669 --> 28:14.792
- Drake still makes Wren for this, huh?
- He does.

28:15.579 --> 28:17.318
But you don't buy it.

28:18.799 --> 28:20.555
I know that look on you.

28:22.729 --> 28:25.751
Perhaps your Piotrowski and
his blood spatter patterning

28:25.762 --> 28:28.053
will settle it one way or another.

28:29.179 --> 28:30.379
Maybe.

28:33.739 --> 28:35.981
But I'm gonna need me some rabbits.

28:42.633 --> 28:43.959
The ironworks.

28:58.338 --> 28:59.538
Mr. Hackman.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.466
Mr. Hackman.

29:45.518 --> 29:49.038
Inspector, have you come to
cart off more of my players?

29:49.039 --> 29:51.012
Eliot, trap it first.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.508
You spend every lunchtime thus?

29:52.509 --> 29:53.711
Most days.

29:54.161 --> 29:58.008
Good for the boys, let
off steam, oil the joints.

29:58.009 --> 30:00.571
Remember, the team achieves
higher than the man.

30:01.299 --> 30:04.903
We used to be employed thus, at
this factory, in a team, I mean.

30:05.160 --> 30:07.806
The division of labour
left to our judgement,

30:07.817 --> 30:10.916
the spoils, ours to
divide as we saw fit.

30:11.430 --> 30:12.776
Those days are gone.

30:13.089 --> 30:15.352
Trying to break the
union are them bosses.

30:15.859 --> 30:18.438
Prise apart the worker from his fellows.

30:18.749 --> 30:22.975
But this, the football, they
can't take that away from us.

30:23.116 --> 30:25.418
You diagram fastidiously, sir.

30:25.419 --> 30:27.987
Tactics, the inner workings of the game.

30:29.819 --> 30:31.626
My old man was a watchmaker.

30:32.329 --> 30:34.758
Every night, fingers
at springs and cogs,

30:34.759 --> 30:37.178
assembling and correcting.

30:37.449 --> 30:38.966
Never had the skill for it.

30:39.339 --> 30:41.134
These are anvil hands.

30:42.626 --> 30:44.984
But he tried to school
me, he did, my pa.

30:45.759 --> 30:47.557
Taught me about Isaac Newton,

30:48.148 --> 30:52.118
who thought the universe
entire, one vast clockwork,

30:52.119 --> 30:54.392
wound on God's own crankshaft.

30:54.403 --> 30:57.843
And you find this sport,
these men to be as cogs?

30:58.641 --> 31:02.128
I merely find they are the best
of themselves at work harmonious.

31:02.394 --> 31:06.057
And Thomas Gower, how does he
fit into such work harmonious?

31:06.068 --> 31:07.409
I don't see him here.

31:08.029 --> 31:10.948
Gower, sacked him this morning.

31:11.195 --> 31:13.775
- For?
- Turned up stinking of booze again.

31:13.981 --> 31:17.496
A man who can not control himself
makes weak his every fellow.

31:17.879 --> 31:20.198
Gower chose the bottle over the hammer,

31:20.199 --> 31:23.053
forever bragging lies
about his military record.

31:23.064 --> 31:24.534
Medals my arse.

31:25.756 --> 31:28.639
Right, right. Gather in.

31:33.529 --> 31:36.356
I need you to retrieve the
military record of Thomas Gower.

31:36.909 --> 31:39.198
With the authority of
Inspector Drake, sir?

31:39.209 --> 31:41.156
With my authority, Drummond.

31:41.355 --> 31:43.838
Um, forgive me, Inspector.
I didn't mean disrespect.

31:43.839 --> 31:45.848
I appreciate your
fastidiousness, Sergeant.

31:45.849 --> 31:49.526
I shall tell my daughter to add it to
her list of your favourable qualities.

31:50.006 --> 31:55.107
Ooh, I do hope you enjoy your stroll
together in Victoria Park this Sunday.

32:00.708 --> 32:03.369
He gave him a long drink
of milk and some bread.

32:03.709 --> 32:06.588
And then she laid her hand on his
head, and looked into his eyes.

32:06.914 --> 32:10.176
For she thought perhaps
that he might be her son,

32:10.439 --> 32:13.234
come back from the jungle,
where the tiger had taken him.

32:17.497 --> 32:19.406
You go. I'll finish the story.

32:31.437 --> 32:35.668
Mr. Drake. Sir, I beg
pardon for the hour.

32:35.669 --> 32:37.125
What is it, Thomas?

32:37.339 --> 32:39.959
I was laid off at the
ironwork, see, and...

32:41.172 --> 32:43.194
I lack a penny for a bed, sir.

32:43.267 --> 32:47.610
And I hoped you might... small loan
that is, it's just a penny or two.

32:50.592 --> 32:52.125
You've been drinking, lad?

32:52.136 --> 32:53.385
No, sir.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.856
No, Sergeant. I...

32:59.349 --> 33:01.682
Come inside. Come on.

33:06.189 --> 33:07.688
It's not right, Bennet.

33:07.689 --> 33:09.285
Keep your voice down, girl.

33:09.296 --> 33:11.842
He stinks, like a brewer's floor.

33:11.853 --> 33:13.270
He is my guest.

33:13.281 --> 33:15.202
I don't want him near Connor.

33:16.059 --> 33:19.083
I'm trying to mother a
child who will not have me.

33:19.719 --> 33:24.168
And you, his father, invites
a known murderer into our home!

33:26.560 --> 33:28.428
I saved the boy from the rope.

33:28.429 --> 33:30.123
I sent him to war.

33:30.559 --> 33:31.759
There's...

33:33.228 --> 33:36.311
I have an obligation to see him right.

33:47.784 --> 33:49.014
Coffee.

33:50.197 --> 33:51.636
Drink it up.

33:58.495 --> 33:59.723
Thomas,

34:02.367 --> 34:03.707
the booze?

34:04.169 --> 34:05.462
What about it?

34:06.669 --> 34:08.818
You know the factory don't allow it.

34:09.279 --> 34:11.418
Well, I lost that job anyways.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.658
It's cheaper elsewhere, ain't it?

34:15.023 --> 34:16.438
The north,

34:17.126 --> 34:19.991
money first, men second.

34:20.129 --> 34:23.550
Men's lives thrown away like peelings.

34:23.562 --> 34:27.297
And in that factory,
we made the warships,

34:27.299 --> 34:30.766
and them ships throw away men's
lives too with cannon and shell.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.643
Relax. Just slow down, please.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.505
Help me understand.

34:58.049 --> 35:05.246
When you soldiered, you shot
rifles, pistols, swung a blade.

35:05.869 --> 35:08.571
You killed. I know it.

35:09.662 --> 35:13.077
But you never saw Maxim machine gun.

35:14.629 --> 35:18.067
- No, boy. I did not.
- Well, I did, Sergeant.

35:19.089 --> 35:22.561
We had Maxim guns. Whoa!

35:23.120 --> 35:24.655
We had 'em plenty.

35:25.909 --> 35:27.895
Fired your rifle, did ya?

35:29.409 --> 35:33.803
I seen a dozen guns
spit 600 rounds a minute,

35:34.214 --> 35:38.309
fire and thunder what
would split this world.

35:39.159 --> 35:43.393
I seen a thousand men fall.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.083
Not fall but...

35:46.935 --> 35:48.194
shred.

35:49.679 --> 35:57.232
I seen men torn and splintered
into meat with one trigger,

35:58.139 --> 36:00.929
a valley made a butcher's floor.

36:04.638 --> 36:06.547
- Thomas.
- I recall...

36:07.234 --> 36:11.962
when I was a boy, you showed me a tattoo

36:12.145 --> 36:15.067
done by an holy man, you
said, out in the desert,

36:15.597 --> 36:20.222
ink that you might sleep, forget
the things you done at war.

36:20.233 --> 36:21.433
Yeah.

36:23.971 --> 36:26.772
All that lets me sleep
is found in a bottle.

36:27.549 --> 36:33.161
And I am yet to find a
bottle deep and silent enough.

36:33.707 --> 36:39.104
So don't you preach to
me of bloody temperance.

36:50.386 --> 36:51.586
Thomas.

36:53.326 --> 36:54.979
You stay here tonight, eh?

36:56.341 --> 36:57.855
We'll talk more in the morning.

37:00.939 --> 37:02.498
I will help you, lad.

37:04.919 --> 37:06.642
I will find a way.

37:07.179 --> 37:09.084
How, Sergeant?

37:10.659 --> 37:11.913
How?

37:43.490 --> 37:45.352
This way, Miss Susan.

37:45.399 --> 37:47.878
The customs house is close above us now.

37:47.889 --> 37:49.089
Hold,

37:50.081 --> 37:51.794
- what is that?
- Huh?

37:52.380 --> 37:53.789
The river, the tide.

37:54.390 --> 37:58.400
No, no. It's, ah, it's
the Bazalgette sewer.

37:58.882 --> 38:03.578
Miss Susan, oil of camphor, please.

38:04.137 --> 38:07.253
- Wine cellars, you said.
- Come, come, come.

38:09.486 --> 38:12.097
Come, it's straight here. Ahead, now.

38:41.122 --> 38:46.145
Nathaniel, the strong
room, what is within?

38:47.629 --> 38:49.178
Never gone no further.

38:49.862 --> 38:51.062
Why?

38:52.049 --> 38:54.076
Abel Croker's say so.

38:55.326 --> 38:57.777
Here, too much to be missed.

38:57.788 --> 39:01.662
But there, beyond that
barricade, treasure.

39:03.248 --> 39:04.466
Gold?

39:05.299 --> 39:07.080
Barricaded for a reason.

39:07.788 --> 39:10.003
The guard station is unmanned.

39:10.389 --> 39:12.549
They do patrol, however.

39:22.776 --> 39:24.137
Miss Susan!

39:34.947 --> 39:38.311
Miss Susan, please. Please, they come.

39:43.126 --> 39:44.440
Miss Susan!

39:53.209 --> 39:55.310
We leave now.

40:00.778 --> 40:05.425
Boy, I knew you for a
cretin, but a turncoat too?

40:05.775 --> 40:08.312
Wish our lives here to
come tumbling to an end,

40:08.323 --> 40:09.883
- do you?
- No, Abel, Abel,

40:09.894 --> 40:11.963
you beat anyone, you beat me!

40:11.974 --> 40:15.436
Think I will not take my
belt to you? Do you test me?

40:15.447 --> 40:18.514
You wish to be paid for your care of
us. There is a debt remaining, remember?

40:18.525 --> 40:21.387
Or do you imagine it being paid by
me performing your secretarial duties

40:21.398 --> 40:22.784
until the day you die?

40:28.388 --> 40:30.960
I cannot stay here, Abel.

40:32.525 --> 40:33.725
Whatever.

40:33.736 --> 40:35.290
You know that.

40:36.504 --> 40:41.438
Know too that I must take my son
to my chest once more and be free.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.765
Free?

40:42.901 --> 40:44.818
That is not freedom.

40:44.819 --> 40:47.836
Oh? Is it not? Hmm?

40:48.724 --> 40:50.011
See this.

40:50.802 --> 40:54.376
Me... the... the porcelain
alone, three pieces

40:54.387 --> 40:58.178
Japanese awaiting the duty for
Yamanaka and Company, Osaka.

40:58.179 --> 41:00.903
That is thousands upon
thousands of pounds.

41:00.914 --> 41:03.398
Do you think me ignorant of such riches?

41:03.399 --> 41:04.799
I am not.

41:04.859 --> 41:07.861
I have resisted their
lure for reasons with which

41:07.872 --> 41:10.320
you ought to be altogether familiar.

41:11.864 --> 41:14.938
The hazard of overreaching, princess...

41:15.089 --> 41:19.171
55 dead and your lovely
face at the end of a rope.

41:21.791 --> 41:27.128
My motives, what I sought to achieve,

41:29.589 --> 41:32.123
I would take the same risk again.

41:32.759 --> 41:35.674
And hope for an alternative outcome?

41:36.539 --> 41:38.011
Quite so.

41:40.475 --> 41:44.737
But this, this is my escape.

41:45.299 --> 41:48.990
And my husband and I shall
do all we can to take it.

41:49.163 --> 41:51.652
Whether you help us or no, Abel,

41:51.837 --> 41:55.138
you shall receive a great share of
it for the shelter you have given me,

41:55.149 --> 41:59.733
the shelter and the care, because you
are my friend, and will remain ever so.

42:03.127 --> 42:04.407
Am I yours?

42:09.563 --> 42:11.493
More than friend, indeed.

42:14.839 --> 42:19.116
You are my girl who must leave me.

42:22.547 --> 42:24.721
Then help me, Abel.

42:25.369 --> 42:27.327
Help me to be free.

42:52.380 --> 42:53.699
Morning, my love.

42:56.789 --> 42:58.935
Bennet, what I said last night...

42:58.947 --> 43:01.471
Rose, please.

43:02.923 --> 43:04.759
Didn't sleep a wink again.

43:07.109 --> 43:08.510
Dunno how much longer I can...

43:08.521 --> 43:12.941
Darling, things will get better.

43:13.169 --> 43:14.831
We're beginners, aren't we?

43:16.119 --> 43:17.492
We will learn.

43:17.729 --> 43:19.287
Connor will teach us.

43:20.130 --> 43:21.330
Hmm.

43:24.397 --> 43:25.656
The lad?

43:27.276 --> 43:28.935
No sign of rousing.

43:29.404 --> 43:31.238
Didn't like to disturb.

43:31.239 --> 43:32.609
Yeah, best I do it.

43:48.539 --> 43:49.988
Thomas Gower,

43:50.463 --> 43:51.727
Thomas.

43:58.376 --> 43:59.891
Get him out, Bennet.

44:00.056 --> 44:01.815
Get him out of this house!

44:02.373 --> 44:03.903
Forgive me.

44:10.482 --> 44:11.682
Thomas!

44:18.449 --> 44:20.111
Thomas Gower's war record...

44:21.178 --> 44:23.228
court martial, dishonourable discharge.

44:23.229 --> 44:26.502
The man he beat, Private
Carrie, lost an eye.

44:26.969 --> 44:28.988
There was no medal, Bennet.

44:29.409 --> 44:32.002
Gower spent three years at
the military gaol in Gosport.

44:32.013 --> 44:34.775
A man doesn't change, Mr. Drake.

44:37.359 --> 44:40.757
And all this you investigated
with my back turned.

44:42.409 --> 44:44.491
Would you not have done the
same if you thought I had, ah,

44:44.502 --> 44:46.873
an emotional attachment
to the matter at hand?

44:46.884 --> 44:49.172
Of course, just as you taught me,

44:49.449 --> 44:51.682
the great, objective Inspector Reid.

44:58.254 --> 45:02.558
But objectively, this still does not
make Thomas Gower Tanner's killer.

45:02.559 --> 45:05.633
No, it does not, but it behoves
us to ask of him certain questions.

45:05.979 --> 45:08.753
And I would not do that
also with your back turned.

45:09.789 --> 45:12.194
Now, he has gone to ground, Mr. Drake.

45:14.371 --> 45:15.986
I know one place he'd be.

45:16.980 --> 45:19.091
Go on, all of you, outside. Hopscotch.

45:19.102 --> 45:20.835
There'll be hot soup later.

45:39.475 --> 45:41.340
Thank you, Miss Deborah.

45:41.808 --> 45:43.489
It has to stop, Thomas.

45:43.490 --> 45:46.512
The drink, it is a
slow poison and no more.

45:46.922 --> 45:49.209
I don't wanna drink
no more, Miss Deborah.

46:03.908 --> 46:05.108
Where is he?

46:16.555 --> 46:18.724
Thomas, come with us.

46:19.634 --> 46:20.981
You must.

46:21.121 --> 46:22.469
I've done nothing.

46:22.470 --> 46:24.588
That's as may be,
boy, but you must come.

46:24.589 --> 46:26.665
The boy is sick. Can you not see that?

46:26.676 --> 46:29.818
A hangover is hardly the
black death, Miss Goren.

46:30.367 --> 46:33.665
I had hoped perhaps you were coming
with news of Rabbi Ratovski's murderer,

46:33.676 --> 46:36.403
or coming to tell me that Isaac
Bloom was vindicated after all,

46:36.414 --> 46:38.426
and your remorse for
his death was fathomless.

46:38.437 --> 46:41.187
I did not expect you to be
dragging off a suffering young man.

46:41.198 --> 46:42.892
Will you hang him for Ratovski too?

46:42.903 --> 46:45.631
Ratovski was murdered by
Isaac Bloom, Miss Goren.

46:46.189 --> 46:47.745
And Bloom met his justice.

46:49.209 --> 46:50.409
Thomas, now.

46:56.209 --> 46:58.773
He is wrong, Edmund, and you know it.

47:10.117 --> 47:11.561
You lied to me.

47:12.339 --> 47:14.308
I told you what you wanted to hear.

47:14.309 --> 47:16.217
I wanna hear the truth.

47:18.009 --> 47:19.324
I don't know the truth.

47:19.335 --> 47:21.691
No more lies, boy!

47:26.904 --> 47:28.921
You dossed in his bed
that night, didn't you?

47:38.324 --> 47:40.678
And you hid your ruined shirt in panic.

47:51.846 --> 47:53.250
He was kind to you.

47:59.109 --> 48:02.718
He was a friend to you.

48:03.719 --> 48:06.260
Was Private Carrie a friend also?

48:06.642 --> 48:09.543
As you drank and you drank
and you blinded Carrie.

48:09.554 --> 48:12.258
And you drank and you drank,
and you murdered Tanner.

48:12.259 --> 48:16.466
I... I don't know.

48:17.527 --> 48:23.296
We... we were celebrating things.
Charlie got offered a new job,

48:23.582 --> 48:25.639
a team transfer.

48:25.917 --> 48:28.498
But I... I'd been to the bowl.

48:28.869 --> 48:30.559
Something smashed.

48:30.819 --> 48:32.261
It broke.

48:32.919 --> 48:34.571
Then I was out cold.

48:35.779 --> 48:38.165
When I woke, Charlie was...

48:40.079 --> 48:41.963
I had blood on me.

48:42.059 --> 48:43.357
Because you killed him.

48:43.368 --> 48:45.039
I was afraid!

48:45.439 --> 48:46.899
I didn't know.

48:47.439 --> 48:49.192
It's all black.

48:50.241 --> 48:51.828
Don't you see?

48:52.249 --> 48:54.745
I forget all but what I drink to forget.

48:54.756 --> 48:58.483
It was you. You pulverized
Tanner with a hammer.

48:58.829 --> 49:01.161
As you beat Carrie,
your brother-in-arms,

49:01.172 --> 49:05.218
as you murdered Manby the toymaker
when a mere boy in this parish.

49:05.219 --> 49:08.373
You were a killer then,
and you are a killer still.

49:08.384 --> 49:11.556
- It's... it's dark.
- It was you. Say it.

49:11.567 --> 49:16.024
- I cannot remember.
- Thomas, say it.

49:17.702 --> 49:19.170
Say it.

49:23.279 --> 49:27.855
I done it. I done it.

49:29.510 --> 49:31.085
I killed him.

49:39.524 --> 49:40.919
I got it.

49:41.899 --> 49:43.413
I got it.

49:43.686 --> 49:47.564
The blood, the sheet,
the shirt. Have a see.

49:47.575 --> 49:49.064
Gower confessed.

49:49.451 --> 49:50.786
The shirt is his.

49:52.890 --> 49:54.423
Oh, he did, huh?

49:55.128 --> 49:57.958
Well, it looks like we got
ourselves a little conundrum.

49:57.959 --> 50:00.314
Because whoever was wearing that shirt

50:00.449 --> 50:02.781
did not kill Charlie Tanner.

50:05.229 --> 50:07.742
The spatter on the wall
where Charlie was killed.

50:07.753 --> 50:09.568
Now, you see the force of it?

50:09.569 --> 50:12.048
It's the velocity of the spray.

50:12.049 --> 50:14.068
Now you look at the bed.

50:14.402 --> 50:17.073
Rounder droplets, less force.

50:17.084 --> 50:19.326
Now, this is cast off spatter.

50:19.337 --> 50:22.401
The killer was hammering
Tanner by the wall.

50:22.413 --> 50:24.671
He swings back, and blood
flies off the hammer,

50:24.682 --> 50:26.137
lands behind him onto the bed.

50:26.148 --> 50:29.423
But look at the shape.

50:30.602 --> 50:34.708
Now, there should be blood there
too, but there's a ghosting.

50:34.709 --> 50:37.232
- So something stopped him.
- Somebody.

50:39.315 --> 50:40.704
The shirt.

50:41.713 --> 50:43.478
The pattern matches.

50:43.479 --> 50:45.228
Cast off spatter.

50:45.371 --> 50:49.511
Meaning, this is Thomas Gower's
shirt, then Gower ain't your killer,

50:49.522 --> 50:51.868
because he was flat out on
the bed behind the killer

50:51.879 --> 50:53.852
when Charlie Tanner
got his brains beat out.

50:53.863 --> 50:56.056
- There was a third.
- Correct.

50:56.526 --> 50:57.968
And they took something.

51:00.077 --> 51:03.860
Now, I almost missed it on account
of he was such a mess, but here.

51:04.687 --> 51:06.523
It's a feint ligature.

51:07.009 --> 51:09.129
He wore something around his neck.

51:09.519 --> 51:11.302
Hung there and torn off.

51:13.766 --> 51:15.501
Oh, Inspectors.

51:16.234 --> 51:20.123
Ah, Captain, all the constables
are asking after the, ah...

51:21.218 --> 51:23.146
the bunnies, sir.

51:23.488 --> 51:26.570
That they might be
put in a pot for stew.

51:40.998 --> 51:44.185
A few rabbits might have made
a noble sacrifice in the...

51:44.698 --> 51:46.827
pursuit of this forensication.

51:48.577 --> 51:50.134
Impressive work, Captain.

51:53.307 --> 51:55.176
Where's your money now, Reid?

51:58.675 --> 52:03.431
Thomas, I expected you to be relieved.

52:05.019 --> 52:07.108
Relieved, Mr. Drake?

52:07.982 --> 52:09.606
And if it wasn't for the gin,

52:10.090 --> 52:12.971
I would have not lied there
in my own black sweat and piss

52:12.982 --> 52:15.056
while Charlie took a
hammer from some bastard.

52:15.067 --> 52:18.020
You could not help him
then, so help him now.

52:18.744 --> 52:21.229
You said that Tanner
was offered a transfer.

52:23.253 --> 52:25.095
The Woolwich Arsenal wanted him.

52:25.749 --> 52:30.207
Good job, good pay,
captaining in the team.

52:31.209 --> 52:34.844
Charlie could leave Whitechapel and
all these shitcake streets behind him.

52:34.855 --> 52:39.809
Thomas, did Charlie Tanner wear anything
about his neck, a cross or a locket?

52:40.179 --> 52:41.756
He had a pendant.

52:41.979 --> 52:43.882
St. Sebastian, he said.

52:44.799 --> 52:48.441
Patron of athletes and of soldiers too.

52:49.319 --> 52:50.925
St. Sebastian.

53:07.539 --> 53:08.739
Here we go.

53:09.782 --> 53:11.088
St. Sebastian.

53:39.693 --> 53:40.912
My boy.

53:44.995 --> 53:46.624
Ah, I won't run.

53:47.109 --> 53:49.340
Never had the speed anyways.

53:49.828 --> 53:51.338
Not like Charlie did.

53:51.574 --> 53:53.565
He was running from you, wasn't he?

53:54.629 --> 53:57.162
And you couldn't stand to
see him leave your team.

53:57.749 --> 54:00.679
I made him, here.

54:02.929 --> 54:04.469
He was nothing.

54:05.729 --> 54:07.685
He was the shit on your shoe.

54:08.819 --> 54:10.736
And he would repay me thus?

54:12.594 --> 54:14.383
I made him!

54:14.394 --> 54:18.250
Human beings are not
cast metal, Mr. Hackman.

54:18.399 --> 54:21.497
They are not ore to
be forged as you wish.

54:24.539 --> 54:27.255
My old man would talk of the universe,

54:27.889 --> 54:31.424
God's crankshaft, Newton.

54:32.399 --> 54:36.809
What good's all them laws
against a man's own lawless heart?

54:40.053 --> 54:44.009
It's us always, ain't it?

54:46.330 --> 54:48.338
The force unfactored,

54:49.368 --> 54:51.940
the secret fault,

54:52.996 --> 54:57.745
the nameless splinter
that breaks the system.

55:02.333 --> 55:03.858
I loved that boy.

55:07.449 --> 55:09.016
Men of iron?

55:11.099 --> 55:13.492
Men of smoke is all we are.

55:21.577 --> 55:23.089
Bring me them shackles.

55:28.297 --> 55:29.796
We made them here.

55:53.180 --> 55:55.379
I need dynamite for the door.

55:56.283 --> 55:58.030
You find a fence.

55:59.283 --> 56:01.260
Everything has to be right.

56:02.081 --> 56:05.881
And when it's done,
everything has to be ready.

56:07.596 --> 56:10.735
Connor, we cannot make a single mistake

56:10.746 --> 56:12.793
- when we take him back.
- I know, darling.

56:14.731 --> 56:15.931
I know.

56:16.509 --> 56:19.308
I need to see the house,
the streets around it.

56:20.669 --> 56:24.014
We need to know how to
enter and leave as ghosts.

56:31.119 --> 56:34.562
Well, it looks like we have ourselves
another midnight ramble, huh?

56:48.707 --> 56:51.211
That's useful work you're
doing for Miss Goren, Thomas.

56:54.623 --> 56:56.653
Heard it was Hackman done in Charlie.

56:57.479 --> 56:58.686
It was.

56:59.352 --> 57:00.984
Then why are you here?

57:01.969 --> 57:05.597
Because, lad, the offer still stands.

57:06.309 --> 57:08.667
You can work at Leman Street with me.

57:09.279 --> 57:11.278
But you have to stop the drinking.

57:12.799 --> 57:16.027
I'd sooner have took the
rope than seen what I seen,

57:16.657 --> 57:18.443
done what I done.

57:19.399 --> 57:21.172
You think you saved me?

57:22.208 --> 57:25.356
You sent me somewhere worse than death.

57:25.367 --> 57:27.493
- Thomas.
- You ain't my friend.

57:27.742 --> 57:30.232
You ain't my guardian.

57:32.083 --> 57:35.708
You are black wings
casting shadow over me.

57:36.718 --> 57:40.657
And I know not if I shall
ever feel light again.

58:02.489 --> 58:03.745
You wished to see me?

58:15.357 --> 58:19.188
Inspector Reid, when you
worked under Fred Abberline,

58:19.189 --> 58:22.268
did you presume to question
his judgement at every turn?

58:25.611 --> 58:26.811
Mr. Drake, Bennet...

58:26.822 --> 58:29.563
Inspector Drake, I am Inspector Drake.

58:29.889 --> 58:34.202
And when I was your sergeant, did I
presume to question your judgement?

58:35.359 --> 58:37.558
You did not, Inspector Drake.

58:37.559 --> 58:41.608
Then with what conceited licence
is it you ceaselessly question mine?

58:43.269 --> 58:47.470
My suspicions of Thomas Gower
were, I accept, unfounded.

58:47.481 --> 58:48.700
So they were.

58:48.929 --> 58:51.421
And yet what a merry dance
you led behind my back

58:51.432 --> 58:53.036
to see him proved otherwise.

58:53.199 --> 58:56.389
But more fool me to be
surprised when your very return

58:56.400 --> 58:59.568
to Whitechapel was to question
my conviction of Isaac Bloom

58:59.735 --> 59:01.683
Because even though he'd
come to pass his days

59:01.694 --> 59:03.690
shucking oysters on
the sands of Hampton,

59:03.702 --> 59:06.926
my judgement was apparently
insufficient for the great Edmund Reid.

59:06.937 --> 59:08.470
Inspector Drake, it
was never my intention

59:08.481 --> 59:10.949
- to doubt your...
- Intention, Inspector?

59:11.040 --> 59:12.887
Well, let's not speak of those.

59:13.249 --> 59:16.313
It was never my intention to
have you here before me thus!

59:16.966 --> 59:18.678
But of late, I have come to thinking

59:18.679 --> 59:20.474
a man's intentions count for something

59:20.485 --> 59:21.877
- less than nought in this world.
- Bennet.

59:21.888 --> 59:23.908
You will hear me, Edmund Reid!

59:27.937 --> 59:34.438
I watched you, your sly words,
pressing and turning him to your will.

59:34.542 --> 59:37.454
Even had the boy himself
believe he'd done them things!

59:44.136 --> 59:46.749
We coppered good
together, you and I once.

59:47.596 --> 59:51.368
But, ah, maybe them days have passed.

59:55.549 --> 59:59.668
You will henceforth do me the
courtesy of respect, Mr. Reid.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:05.108
If I find you manoeuvring
beyond my eyeline once more,

01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:10.023
I will revoke your warrant card,
send you away, and do so with joy.

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:17.421
I will endeavour to serve this
division to my utmost, Inspector Drake.

01:00:20.113 --> 01:00:22.291
Then we are concluded, Inspector Reid.

01:00:31.099 --> 01:00:35.348
The Talmud tells us that
the tree of knowledge itself,

01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:39.323
instrument of our
fall, was a grape vine.

01:00:40.379 --> 01:00:44.577
Time was, Thomas, the vine
held its sway over me also.

01:00:46.629 --> 01:00:50.325
- But not now?
- But not now.

01:00:55.869 --> 01:00:59.439
Deborah tells me that you
were born a Jew, Thomas.

01:01:03.179 --> 01:01:04.740
Do you believe in God?

01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:10.944
No God would permit
the things I've seen.

01:01:11.369 --> 01:01:15.758
But we can help you, Thomas,
give you comfort here.

01:01:18.459 --> 01:01:20.458
Would you care to pray with me?

01:01:20.459 --> 01:01:22.225
I don't want your help.

01:01:22.969 --> 01:01:24.912
I don't need help from nobody.

01:01:24.923 --> 01:01:26.919
- Thomas.
- Not you neither, Miss Goren.

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:30.137
I... I should not have come back to you.

01:04:14.738 --> 01:04:16.621
Miss Deborah.

01:04:22.839 --> 01:04:25.219
Connor sleeps in their
bedroom at the back.

01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:27.437
I'll show you where
we can flee with him.

01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:28.932
I need to see him.

01:04:29.367 --> 01:04:31.104
Caitlin, no.

01:04:31.115 --> 01:04:35.818
I need to see him, Matthew,
if only for a moment.

01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:11.012
My boy, my darling.

01:05:20.339 --> 01:05:22.673
Caitlin, we have to leave!

01:05:25.866 --> 01:05:27.243
Mama.

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:32.802
Do you want your mama, sweet boy?

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:35.660
Do you want your mum?

01:05:46.986 --> 01:05:51.986
