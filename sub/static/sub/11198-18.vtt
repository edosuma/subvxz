00:05.320 --> 00:07.720
<i>Previously on "Stargate SG-1":</i>

00:07.800 --> 00:10.080
General Hammond?
This is Mr Bregman.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.720
No one around here wants to be
part of your little reality show.

00:13.800 --> 00:18.280
The President of the United States
invited me to do this.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.920
Look, Mr Bregman. You are here
strictly to document what is going on.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.240
Not to pursue anything prejudicial
to Air Force personnel.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.320
Call me Emmett.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.760
I'm gonna get you
on camera sooner or later.

00:28.840 --> 00:32.720
Even if all I get is a series of shots
of you avoiding being got.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.200
I hope shots of my ass serve you well.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.680
Well, I'll be damned.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.800
- It's my unborn son, sir.
- Take cover!

00:44.280 --> 00:47.440
After it engaged weapons
it activated a long-range communicator.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.800
Taking fire! Wells has been hit.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.840
- Are you flirting with me?
- Ah, well...

00:57.920 --> 01:00.480
Excuse me, ma'am.
You're required in the ready room.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.680
That's why we're not allowed to film.

01:02.760 --> 01:06.160
Every time they open that gate,
something could go wrong.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.080
All because I wanted an aerial survey.

01:08.160 --> 01:11.160
Took me too long to figure out
it sent a transmission.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.960
None of that matters now.

01:17.440 --> 01:20.040
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

01:25.480 --> 01:28.680
What's going on? You were scheduled
to get shots of the gate.

01:28.760 --> 01:31.320
- We got bumped again.
- Something's up.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.680
- You just missed SG-1 in full gear.
- You got it on tape?

01:34.760 --> 01:37.360
- It's unauthorised.
- Ongoing activity, I know.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.000
But SG-1? Dr Jackson wasn't going
offworld for days. What's changed?

01:41.080 --> 01:43.160
- I don't know.
- Something big?

01:43.240 --> 01:45.560
Something big happens all the time.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.240
- What's this?
- Follow me.

01:50.040 --> 01:53.360
- Dr Fraiser!
- I'm sorry, I have to go.

01:53.440 --> 01:57.640
You're not allowed, Mr Bregman.
And you know that.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.840
There are days when you feel
the pressure. I'm trained to handle it.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.480
With all due respect,

03:06.560 --> 03:11.400
how can anyone be trained to handle
an alien encounter where the stakes,

03:11.480 --> 03:15.480
if what I'm told is correct,
could be the survival of the planet?

03:15.560 --> 03:20.080
It's important to remember
that it's not just about this planet.

03:20.160 --> 03:24.040
Countless humans throughout the galaxy,
that originated here on Earth,

03:24.120 --> 03:27.000
have been enslaved
for thousands of years.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.080
We're taking the fight to the Goa'uld
on their behalf.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.480
How do you think the world is gonna react

03:33.560 --> 03:38.120
when they discover that an alien war
has been waged without their knowledge?

03:39.920 --> 03:43.040
I don't think that that's for me to...

03:45.000 --> 03:47.080
Are you suggesting we shouldn't do this?

03:47.160 --> 03:52.720
No, I'm not saying we shouldn't defend
ourselves, I'm simply asking your opinion.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.280
I don't think that's for me to, um...

03:56.720 --> 03:59.120
No. Stop it right there.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.080
<i>(Carter) I don't know...</i>

04:02.320 --> 04:04.720
You see, this is not her fault.

04:04.800 --> 04:10.000
I backed her into a corner and I don't want
to make this thing look antagonistic, so...

04:10.080 --> 04:12.040
OK, so lose this?

04:12.120 --> 04:16.640
Well, skip ahead to after the apology.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.279
There. That's it.

04:20.360 --> 04:25.120
<i>(Bregman) One day this secret will come
out. How do you think people will react?</i>

04:25.200 --> 04:29.240
<i>- Much better way of asking the question.
- (Carter) I honestly don't know.</i>

04:29.320 --> 04:35.400
<i>I hope they can appreciate everything
we've been through. What it all means.</i>

04:35.480 --> 04:40.440
<i>I hope that they will understand why the
people in charge chose to keep it a secret.</i>

04:40.520 --> 04:43.880
<i>(Bregman) Is it difficult
to keep the secret?</i>

04:43.960 --> 04:49.160
<i>Yeah. Of all the things I do around here,
in many ways that is the hardest.</i>

04:49.240 --> 04:55.320
<i>Sometimes you look at what's going on
here on Earth and it makes you scream.</i>

04:55.400 --> 04:58.560
<i>You want to tell people
it is all so much bigger.</i>

04:58.640 --> 05:03.800
Stop it right there and go right to
Dr Jackson saying "Whether I was right..."

05:03.880 --> 05:06.760
And you're gonna put me
into the Carter interview.

05:06.840 --> 05:12.080
Especially the line "Is it difficult
to keep the secret?" All right. Move on.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.800
<i>(Daniel) Whether I was right
doesn't matter, given the truth.</i>

05:15.880 --> 05:18.600
<i>- (Bregman) Truth matters to you?
- To everyone, I hope.</i>

05:18.680 --> 05:24.120
What truth? For the people here on Earth?
Or are we talking about another planet?

05:24.200 --> 05:27.320
People on other planets
are no less human.

05:27.400 --> 05:32.040
People who've had their freedom usurped.
People forced to worship false gods.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.760
But what about people here on Earth?
Are they entitled to the truth?

05:35.840 --> 05:39.920
- Is that what this is about?
- This? I'm not in control of when this airs.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.640
<i>Do you think this should get out?
If it were up to you.</i>

05:42.720 --> 05:45.000
Right there. Cut together.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.080
Well, that's a complicated issue.

05:47.160 --> 05:53.800
I'm asking you. Do you think people on
Earth should know about this right now?

05:53.880 --> 05:57.800
- What do you think would happen?
- People don't care much what I think.

05:57.880 --> 06:01.440
Cut that line. Nobody cares that
nobody cares what I think. Lose it.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.240
- OK. It's gone.
- Moving on.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.200
<i>I haven't done what you've done.
I think people care what you think.</i>

06:08.280 --> 06:13.760
<i>Well, I think it's a relative question.
And it depends on your point of view.</i>

06:14.640 --> 06:17.160
No, stop it. This is just terrible.

06:17.240 --> 06:21.320
Really? I think it's pretty interesting stuff.
You did a good job of...

06:21.400 --> 06:22.920
Yak, yak, yak, yak.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.200
- A bunch of talking heads is what it is.
- I could watch Major Carter talk all day.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.200
We need images to tell this story.
What these people are doing, good or bad,

06:31.280 --> 06:35.000
makes the lunar landing look like
we were testing our toes in the ocean.

06:35.080 --> 06:38.760
And what have we got to show for it?
Yak yak yak. Nothing.

06:38.840 --> 06:42.160
Where's the equivalent shot of Shepherd
golfing on the moon?

06:42.240 --> 06:45.120
We don't have it.
This is unbelievably boring.

07:03.880 --> 07:08.520
- Hi, Jack. Thanks for coming.
- I was told you said there were six Jaffa.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.160
Where'd you learn to count?

07:26.080 --> 07:31.960
Ships didn't start coming down till
you radioed you were through the gate.

07:36.280 --> 07:41.520
Something tells me they're throwing
this party in your honour. Got those clips?

07:41.600 --> 07:44.280
<i>(man) Our position is being compromised.</i>

07:44.360 --> 07:47.080
<i>We're not gonna be able
to hold the gate for long.</i>

07:47.160 --> 07:50.880
It doesn't matter. We're not gonna be
able to hold this position for long.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.960
<i>(Fraiser) I need more time to stabilise
this patient. He can't be moved yet.</i>

07:55.040 --> 07:58.080
Sir! We gotta fall back!

08:10.640 --> 08:13.160
Sir!

08:36.640 --> 08:40.679
That's 50 calibre, right? You can get
really shaken up with that thing.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.159
- Our guys are trained...
- I'm kidding.

08:43.240 --> 08:46.600
What is this? Get a shot of this.
Can you explain how this operates?

08:46.680 --> 08:48.720
Uh, sure.

08:48.800 --> 08:53.920
Our guys like to play a little Space
Invaders when there's not much going on.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.200
- Ha ha. Very funny.
- No, obviously I'm kidding.

08:58.280 --> 09:02.720
It would be completely inappropriate for
any airman to play video games on duty.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.680
Can we move on?
What's that on the wall here?

09:05.760 --> 09:09.080
- Here is the manual override for the Iris.
- Are you kidding now?

09:09.160 --> 09:13.240
- No, I'm serious. Incoming wormhole!
- We're gonna have to leave now.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.360
- No, keep shooting!
- I can't do that.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.280
<i>- I can do it.
- (Hammond) Remove that camera crew!</i>

09:18.360 --> 09:20.160
<i>Now!</i>

09:22.920 --> 09:26.640
<i>(Carter) We are under fire and have
serious casualties. Coming in hot.</i>

09:26.720 --> 09:29.840
<i>(man) Receiving SG-1's Iris code, sir.</i>

09:29.920 --> 09:32.200
<i>(Hammond) Open the Iris.</i>

09:32.280 --> 09:36.080
<i>- This way, sir.
- (PA) Medical team to the gate room.</i>

09:39.160 --> 09:41.760
We have to clear this area.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.600
Sorry about that.
Here, take the damn thing.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.840
In future, sir, could you leave
the camera work to me?

10:03.800 --> 10:06.360
I'll leave it to you.
Here she comes. Let's go.

10:06.440 --> 10:11.000
Don't look at him, we're cleared to shoot
here. Just follow me. Bring the sound!

10:11.080 --> 10:13.160
- Major! What happened?
- Please.

10:13.240 --> 10:16.560
I know at least one person was injured.
All I want to say is...

10:16.640 --> 10:20.720
Look, leave me alone.
And shut that damn thing off!

10:20.800 --> 10:23.880
No, I just want to say how sorry I am...

10:28.240 --> 10:32.800
Why is that camera off? You don't know
what you're doing here, maybe I do.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.080
These people risk their lives for us.

10:35.160 --> 10:38.880
I want to see what they go through,
even if they don't want us to.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.080
And I want other people to see it.

10:41.160 --> 10:45.400
What do you think they're doing out
there? Protecting and defending secrecy?

10:45.480 --> 10:47.880
That's the world of Mao, of Stalin.

10:47.960 --> 10:53.240
The world of secret police,
secret trials, secret deaths.

10:55.080 --> 11:00.560
You force the press into the cold
and all you will get is lies and innuendo.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.840
And nothing is worse for a free society

11:03.920 --> 11:09.000
than a press that is in service
to the military and the politicians.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.880
Nothing!

11:11.720 --> 11:16.200
You turn that camera off
when I tell you to turn it off!

11:17.240 --> 11:20.600
You think I give a damn
what you think about me?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.680
You serve the people. So do I.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.760
Hey, how you doing?

11:43.840 --> 11:48.040
I don't suppose you know anything
about what's going on here?

11:48.120 --> 11:51.600
There are multiple injuries.
At least two people were hit.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.880
There was a firefight.
One of the teams got ambushed

11:54.960 --> 11:58.520
so they sent in SG-1, SG-5,
Fraiser and the medical team.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.320
Someone from the original team
must be badly hurt.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.760
- A nurse said there was a casualty.
- Someone die?

12:04.840 --> 12:08.720
- She wouldn't say who.
- Carter wouldn't be crying unless...

12:08.800 --> 12:12.280
We hear somebody actually
may have died. What have you got?

12:12.360 --> 12:13.600
O'Neill.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.160
- You sure?
- No, I heard O'Neill's on a gurney.

12:18.240 --> 12:21.560
He took a blast. He's not moving.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.560
<i>(knock at door)</i>

12:30.640 --> 12:32.760
General Hammond. Mr Woolsey.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.640
General.

12:37.440 --> 12:43.320
I know these orders came from Kinsey's
office. Why don't you tell me the rest?

12:43.400 --> 12:45.640
As chairman of the Oversight Committee,

12:45.720 --> 12:51.080
Kinsey asked that I review your decision
regarding the attempted rescue of SG-13.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.840
- "Attempted"?
- There were several casualties, sir.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.640
I'd hardly call it a success.

12:56.720 --> 13:01.720
My decisions are reviewed by the Air
Force Chief of Staff and the president.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.520
As of yet I haven't even filed
a preliminary mission report.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.240
When I do, you're welcome to read it.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.440
I have been authorised to begin
a full investigation,

13:11.520 --> 13:16.760
as part of a larger examination of SGC's
strategic policy that we are preparing.

13:17.280 --> 13:22.680
I've enclosed a list of interviews I will be
conducting, and materials I will require.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.920
We expect your full cooperation.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.680
General.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.440
How are you holding up?

13:38.360 --> 13:42.200
- I'm OK, sir.
- Did you talk to Agent Barrett?

13:42.280 --> 13:46.560
He said as far as he knows, Woolsey
is clean. But he's sharp as they come.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.440
He's got an MBA and an LLB
from Harvard.

13:49.520 --> 13:54.640
He was lead counsel for the Corps of
Engineers and sat on the defence board.

13:54.720 --> 13:59.440
He resigned when it was disclosed that
he had financial ties to a large corporation

13:59.520 --> 14:04.480
that had been awarded over $800 million
in defence contracts by the Pentagon.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.560
He's been with the NlD since then.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.120
Barrett faxed me this internal NlD memo
Woolsey recently wrote.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.080
I think you should read it.

14:14.080 --> 14:17.040
What do we do, sir?

14:17.120 --> 14:19.960
- Just tell the truth.
- Yes, sir.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.720
There's going to be
a memorial service on Wednesday.

14:24.800 --> 14:28.800
I think it would be appropriate
if you said a few words.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.600
Yes, sir.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.320
Sir?

14:36.200 --> 14:38.600
How are you holding up?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.600
You try to tell yourself that...

14:44.560 --> 14:49.360
every man and woman under your
command means the same to you.

14:50.280 --> 14:54.920
Each has to be equally valuable if
you're gonna make the kinds of decisions

14:55.000 --> 14:58.560
that affect their lives the way I have to.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.600
But you can't help it.

15:02.680 --> 15:06.080
You get closer to some people.

15:06.160 --> 15:09.040
You never want to lose anyone.

15:21.760 --> 15:25.640
Have a seat, Major.
Let me explain why I'm here.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.120
I know why you're here.

15:29.440 --> 15:34.400
I believe classified military operations
require oversight.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.720
This isn't the first time we've been
scrutinised by the NlD.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.680
I know the stakes around here
are always high,

15:41.760 --> 15:44.360
but there were
serious casualties this time.

15:44.440 --> 15:47.040
Someone of great value
to this programme is dead.

15:47.120 --> 15:52.320
I know that. And don't you dare
think anyone is taking it lightly.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.640
You're a seasoned combat officer.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.840
This isn't the first time
you've lost a close colleague.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.840
Nor do I expect it will be the last.

16:02.920 --> 16:07.760
I just want to make sure
that it wasn't avoidable in this case.

16:07.840 --> 16:13.160
Despite what you might think,
the only reason I'm here is to get the truth.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.640
Did you have a question?

16:17.720 --> 16:20.440
Oh, yes. A few.

16:20.520 --> 16:25.480
What made you think it was safe
for SG-13 to remain on the planet?

16:25.560 --> 16:27.600
That's not really my call.

16:27.680 --> 16:31.480
But you thought it was worth risking
the lives of an SG team

16:31.560 --> 16:35.120
to get an aerial survey of these ruins.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.600
The device was damaged.
It took a while to get an interface.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.680
The memory contained
an enormous amount of information.

16:41.760 --> 16:46.040
So you would have me believe
that this was an acceptable risk?

16:47.800 --> 16:51.040
- This is what we do.
- Make bad decisions.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.800
It's easy to predict the score
when the game's over.

16:53.880 --> 16:58.960
And if we'd found weapons in those ruins
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

16:59.040 --> 17:02.000
But you didn't. And we are.

17:04.040 --> 17:09.560
If there had been weapons in those ruins,
they would be in the hands of the Goa'uld.

17:09.640 --> 17:13.520
The fact is, this mission was botched
from the beginning to the end.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.920
We don't just leave people behind.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
You can't ask airmen, soldiers, human
beings, to risk their lives without backup.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.079
Without knowing we would be there.

17:23.160 --> 17:27.680
You have been asked to go into combat
where you knew there was no backup.

17:27.760 --> 17:32.200
That is always a possibility
on any mission through the Stargate.

17:32.280 --> 17:35.400
And, please, Major.
None of us likes to admit it,

17:35.480 --> 17:41.800
but there are situations in which the life
of one human being is an acceptable loss.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.800
That wasn't the case here.

17:43.880 --> 17:48.880
No, in this case it was just dumb luck
that there weren't many more lives lost.

17:48.960 --> 17:52.080
I would say it was skill,
training and fortitude.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.440
Based on your expertise
in Goa'uld tactics,

17:54.520 --> 17:59.120
was it not reasonable to conclude
that this was an ambush?

18:02.880 --> 18:06.920
While you are not one of our military
and not eligible for court-martial,

18:07.000 --> 18:12.080
I shouldn't have to remind you
that you are expected to follow orders.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.000
As I was doing on the day in question.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.880
If you fail to testify here today,

18:17.960 --> 18:22.160
I will have you jailed
until such time that you do.

18:23.840 --> 18:28.200
You fire me, you throw me in jail.
You do what you want.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.640
<i>- (Bregman) Dr Jackson.
- Yeah, it's not a good time right now.</i>

18:47.720 --> 18:50.320
I've heard bits and pieces
of what happened.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.520
I was hoping you might
be able to confirm some of it.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.120
Sorry.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.640
Did you...?

19:11.840 --> 19:15.800
You're gonna be all right, Simon.
You'll be home before you know it.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.760
Over here!
Man down over here!

19:20.360 --> 19:23.400
There's a lot of blood
coming from underneath him.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.040
I'll cover you up on this ridge.

19:26.120 --> 19:29.360
- I'm Dr Janet Fraiser. Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

19:29.440 --> 19:33.840
I'm shot bad. I can't move. I can't feel
my leg. I think it went right through me.

19:33.920 --> 19:39.080
- What's your name?
- Senior Airman Wells. Am I gonna die?

19:39.160 --> 19:44.080
Not if I have anything to do with it. We
need to roll him over, stop the bleeding.

19:44.160 --> 19:48.120
Simon, you hang in there.
OK. Easy.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.120
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.560
<i>(screams)</i>

20:00.640 --> 20:04.000
- I'm Daniel Jackson.
- I know. I know. SG-1.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.320
- You're gonna be fine.
- Son of a bitch.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.400
Came out of nowhere.
Shot me in the back.

20:08.480 --> 20:13.040
Let's talk about something else.
What's going on at home?

20:13.120 --> 20:17.680
- My wife is pregnant.
- Yeah? That your first?

20:17.760 --> 20:19.560
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.400
<i>(screams)</i>

20:21.920 --> 20:24.200
That's good. At least you felt that.

20:24.280 --> 20:29.480
<i>(man) Our position's being compromised.
We're not gonna be able to hold the gate.</i>

20:29.560 --> 20:32.280
<i>(O'Neill) We're not gonna hold
this position for long.</i>

20:32.360 --> 20:35.000
I need more time to stabilise this patient.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.880
- He can't be moved yet.
- Go without me. Leave me.

20:37.960 --> 20:42.800
- Nobody is going anywhere.
- I can't believe I'm not gonna see my son.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.320
Stay focused. You know this is a boy
you're gonna have, right?

20:46.400 --> 20:49.600
Tell me the truth.
I'm not gonna make it, right?

20:49.680 --> 20:52.320
- You're gonna be fine.
- Dr Jackson.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.880
Please, please just let me tell my wife,
let me tell my wife that...

20:56.960 --> 20:59.520
<i>(screams)</i>

20:59.600 --> 21:02.080
OK. OK.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.800
Got it.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.320
Just breathe, Simon.

21:13.920 --> 21:18.680
I said now's not a good time. What part
about that didn't you understand?

21:20.040 --> 21:25.280
- You got something on tape, didn't you?
- Get out. Get out.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.960
OK.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.880
I'm going. All right.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.680
You know, I, uh...

21:41.760 --> 21:46.520
I once did a piece on a war photographer.
His name is Martin Krystovski.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.880
For about six months
he was with a unit in Vietnam.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.840
The day before
he was scheduled to leave -

21:52.920 --> 21:56.160
<i>the day before -
he's out with the unit.</i>

21:57.680 --> 22:01.800
And it was just a routine patrol,
or so they thought.

22:01.880 --> 22:06.600
But suddenly,
the lieutenant pulled him down.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.760
And Krystovski hadn't intended
to take a picture,

22:11.840 --> 22:16.840
but his hands were on the camera
and he hit the ground so hard it went off.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.320
And the picture captured...

22:20.240 --> 22:22.360
the lieutenant...

22:22.440 --> 22:27.120
getting... shot... in the head.

22:28.480 --> 22:34.360
And Krystovski said to me "That bullet
would have - should have - hit me."

22:34.440 --> 22:39.480
And he never showed that picture
to anyone. Not for 25 years.

22:40.960 --> 22:47.480
But 25 years later, he got up one morning
and he looked at that picture.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.760
And he saw something...

22:50.840 --> 22:55.360
that... wasn't... horrific.

22:55.440 --> 23:00.680
And he decided to tell the story,
because he realised

23:00.760 --> 23:06.520
that he hadn't accidentally
taken a picture of a man dying.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.960
It was of a man...

23:09.040 --> 23:11.520
saving his life.

23:12.680 --> 23:16.520
The picture... I'm making,

23:16.600 --> 23:18.520
that I'm trying to make,

23:18.600 --> 23:22.120
is about what you people do
every single day,

23:22.200 --> 23:25.680
in extreme circumstances
that no one can even imagine.

23:25.760 --> 23:30.200
And I don't know what happened out
there. I'm sorry about it, whatever it was.

23:30.280 --> 23:36.560
And if you did tape something of it,
that's not gonna change what happened.

23:36.640 --> 23:40.240
What will change is how you feel about it.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.280
General.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.280
I've prepared a written testimony.

24:11.360 --> 24:17.360
- This is your mission report.
- I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.

24:18.360 --> 24:22.720
- Well, then. I guess I'm done.
- Then you'll be leaving.

24:22.800 --> 24:26.120
The president will have my report
by the end of the week.

24:26.200 --> 24:32.200
I'm sure it'll be every bit as interesting as
your memo on the economics of the SGC.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.400
I won't bother asking how you got that.

24:36.480 --> 24:40.880
What was the dollar value
you attributed to an SG team member?

24:40.960 --> 24:44.200
You know damn well I wasn't
pegging the value of a life.

24:44.280 --> 24:49.480
It is a cold, hard fact that it costs millions
of dollars to train these men and women.

24:49.560 --> 24:54.280
And that is a fraction of the funds
being subverted by the Pentagon for this.

24:54.360 --> 24:59.680
It is reprehensible that the taxpayers
of this country are paying enormous sums

24:59.760 --> 25:05.440
to wage a war they know nothing about,
and are getting little, if anything, in return.

25:05.520 --> 25:10.640
If the Stargate were public knowledge,
and your actions were judged in public...

25:10.720 --> 25:15.840
You're suggesting that sending a rescue
team worth $27 million to save one man

25:15.920 --> 25:17.800
is a bad business decision.

25:17.880 --> 25:21.240
- You're putting words in my mouth.
- You said it in black and white.

25:21.320 --> 25:25.760
And I don't think you would dare do that
if this wasn't a classified operation.

25:25.840 --> 25:31.960
The president has asked a documentary
team to get to the truth of what's going on.

25:32.040 --> 25:38.600
Why don't we just go down and give them
the whole truth, as you see it, right now?

25:47.960 --> 25:49.800
That memo is classified.

25:49.880 --> 25:55.600
This investigation is classified. If you
so much as utter even a hint of either,

25:56.160 --> 26:02.320
I'll see you are put away in a cold,
dark place for the rest of time.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.320
- General.
- What is it, Colonel?

26:16.400 --> 26:21.840
Security caught Mr Bregman trying to
access the infirmary. Claims he was lost.

26:21.920 --> 26:26.080
- Get rid of him.
- Sir? Have our orders changed, sir?

26:26.160 --> 26:29.160
Toss him out on his ass, Colonel.

26:35.280 --> 26:39.400
- What's this? What's going on?
- The general's ordered you off the base.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.720
- No, no, he can't do that.
- He is a general.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.280
- Would you stop packing?
- Keep packing.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.920
You got one hour to get off my base
and outta my sight.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.280
- Whose authority?
- My superiors.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.000
I just want to make a phone call.

26:56.080 --> 26:59.120
Call whoever you want.
There's a payphone at the surface.

26:59.200 --> 27:03.400
- Actually, l'd like to borrow your red one.
- You have some nerve.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.920
That's what my mother used to say.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.520
I've been ordered to turn over the tape.

27:28.520 --> 27:31.960
Look, I'm not happy about it either.

27:32.040 --> 27:34.120
I could fight it.

27:34.200 --> 27:38.200
The tape could get lost, or accidentally
erased. These things happen.

27:38.280 --> 27:41.200
But I'm not going to do that.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.440
I had that little weasel of a man
thrown out of here.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.640
But in light of the NlD investigation,

27:46.720 --> 27:51.280
I think there should be a record of what
goes on beyond the classified reports.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.960
And you trust Bregman to portray that?

27:54.040 --> 27:56.240
At the moment I have no other choice.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.720
Hey. Hey.

28:14.800 --> 28:17.360
I got the tape. Put it on.

28:22.960 --> 28:26.760
- Mission file's been declassified.
- Just a minute.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.800
<i>(Daniel) You tell her yourself.</i>

28:28.880 --> 28:32.040
I'm so sorry about this.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.040
<i>I love you so much.</i>

28:36.240 --> 28:37.800
<i>I just wanted...</i>

28:40.400 --> 28:45.480
<i>God, shut it off! Shut it off!
I don't want her to see me die!</i>

28:45.560 --> 28:47.920
<i>(Fraiser) Simon! Simon! Look at me.</i>

28:48.000 --> 28:50.400
<i>You are not going to die, OK?</i>

28:50.480 --> 28:52.920
<i>I did not come all the way out here
for nothing.</i>

28:53.000 --> 28:56.400
<i>We've stemmed the bleeding.
We're gonna get you on a stretcher.</i>

28:56.480 --> 28:59.080
<i>We're gonna get you home
in no time, OK?</i>

28:59.160 --> 29:02.480
<i>- Now you hang in there, Airman.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

29:02.560 --> 29:05.480
<i>(Wells) God! What happened? Is she hit?</i>

29:06.760 --> 29:10.280
<i>(Bosworth) I got him.
You're clear, Dr Jackson.</i>

29:10.360 --> 29:13.040
<i>(Daniel) I need a medic!</i>

29:13.120 --> 29:16.200
<i>- (Daniel) Fraiser's hit! I need a medic!
- (Bosworth) Is she OK?</i>

29:16.280 --> 29:21.080
<i>(Daniel) Sierra Golf niner.
Dr Fraiser's been hit. Position...</i>

29:21.160 --> 29:23.360
<i>I need a medic!</i>

29:25.400 --> 29:28.480
O'Neill's alive. So is Airman Wells.

29:29.760 --> 29:32.360
Dr Fraiser didn't make it.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.200
Sir.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.920
We heard you were up and around.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.480
Yeah.

29:58.360 --> 30:02.320
Still a little tender,
but they said I could go home.

30:03.280 --> 30:08.800
You're lucky that staff blast hit you where
it did. That new vest insert works well.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.880
Didn't help Fraiser much.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.120
No.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.040
How's Cassie?

30:19.120 --> 30:22.360
She's a strong kid.
She survives, you know?

30:22.440 --> 30:24.040
Yeah.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.280
You speaking at the memorial?

30:30.520 --> 30:33.320
Sir, I just wanted to say...

30:35.440 --> 30:38.160
When you were lying there, I...

30:45.880 --> 30:48.200
I'm really glad you're OK.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.640
Come here.

31:31.400 --> 31:35.640
- Dr Jackson.
- Hey. Please, just call me Daniel.

31:36.880 --> 31:39.680
So I hear you're gonna
make a full recovery.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.560
So they say.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.760
- You talk to your wife?
- Yeah.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.680
- Everything's OK?
- Yeah.

31:47.480 --> 31:50.000
I never asked you when she was due.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.840
Couple of weeks.
They say I should be outta here by then.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.920
- That's great.
- Yeah.

31:58.120 --> 32:02.440
I just wanted
to see how you were doing, so...

32:03.600 --> 32:06.080
She's dead because of me.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.120
No.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.440
No, she's dead because a Jaffa shot her.

32:13.520 --> 32:19.640
She was doing her job. Same way you
were doing yours when a Jaffa shot you.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.360
- I can't make it feel right.
- It wasn't right.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.160
Nothing about it was right.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.680
But it also wasn't your fault.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.920
Hey, Teal'c.

33:07.560 --> 33:10.960
General Hammond asked me to speak
at the memorial service.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.040
I am aware.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.800
I don't know what to say.
Nothing seems good enough.

33:17.880 --> 33:21.880
I believe you should only speak
from your heart.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.200
I gotta go pick up Cassie.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.080
Major Carter.

33:32.080 --> 33:35.400
I have pondered what I would say
were I given the chance.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.280
Really?

33:39.080 --> 33:43.080
But I believe it would be best
if it came from you.

34:11.520 --> 34:14.560
<i>- (Daniel) Over here.
- Oh.</i>

34:15.719 --> 34:17.920
I was told you might be here, Dr Jackson.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.800
Yeah.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.480
I just, uh...

34:24.320 --> 34:27.400
came by to give this back to you.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.360
I'm not gonna use it.

34:35.679 --> 34:37.560
Wait.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.880
I want you to.

34:48.639 --> 34:51.760
You know, I died in this room.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.639
Ascended.

34:55.239 --> 34:57.520
Dr Fraiser did everything she could.

34:57.600 --> 35:01.080
She went three days without sleep.

35:01.160 --> 35:04.760
Even in the end,
she didn't want to let me go.

35:09.880 --> 35:14.760
I owed her...
a lot more than I ever gave back.

35:17.440 --> 35:21.840
I thought a lot about what you said
about Krystovski.

35:23.800 --> 35:28.040
I think this shows
what Janet Fraiser was all about.

35:28.120 --> 35:30.040
Me too.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.160
I want other people to know.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.600
<i>(plays "taps")</i>

36:45.560 --> 36:49.280
Janet Fraiser
was an extraordinary person.

36:50.160 --> 36:54.560
She was kind, and funny, and talented.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.280
Above all, she was courageous.

36:59.680 --> 37:03.880
Try as I might,
I could not find the words to honour her.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.360
To do justice to her life.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.840
Thankfully I got some help.

37:13.680 --> 37:19.160
While words alone may not be enough,
there are some names that might do.

37:20.240 --> 37:25.000
We often talk about those that give
their lives in the service of their country.

37:25.080 --> 37:30.880
And while Janet Fraiser did just that,
that's not what her life was about.

37:31.680 --> 37:36.920
The following are the names of the men
and women who did not die in service,

37:37.000 --> 37:41.400
but who are in fact alive today
because of Janet.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.760
Major Samantha Carter.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.960
Dr Daniel Jackson.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.320
Colonel Jack O'Neill.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.880
Teal'c.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.400
<i>Sergeant Connie Smith.</i>

37:55.480 --> 37:57.640
<i>Major Ian Hules.</i>

37:57.720 --> 38:00.400
<i>Senior Airman Simon Wells.</i>

38:00.480 --> 38:04.120
<i>(Bregman) Our armed forces
have turned the tide of world wars.</i>

38:04.200 --> 38:10.080
<i>Young men and women from our country
have humbled history's worst tyrants.</i>

38:10.160 --> 38:14.640
<i>We carve our thanks in stone.
We stamp it into medals.</i>

38:14.720 --> 38:21.640
<i>We carefully tend vast fields where those
who gave their lives for our freedom lay.</i>

38:21.720 --> 38:28.600
<i>More than ever, we cannot fail to pass
stories of courage to the next generation.</i>

38:28.680 --> 38:33.840
<i>We must capture their imaginations, while
paying tribute to all those willing to die</i>

38:33.920 --> 38:37.840
<i>for the preservation of our way of life.</i>

38:39.840 --> 38:43.600
It's a shame no one's ever going to see it.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.160
Really?

38:45.240 --> 38:48.000
You, uh...

38:48.080 --> 38:50.520
You don't think it's a little sentimental?

38:50.600 --> 38:53.000
No. It's good.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.240
Well, that's a relief.

38:56.720 --> 38:59.800
Hearing that from you, of all people.

38:59.880 --> 39:05.360
Especially given how you felt about what
I was doing. I understood how you felt...

39:06.520 --> 39:11.680
I'm a big enough man to admit when
I'm wrong. I'm glad you stuck with it.

39:13.320 --> 39:16.280
That means a lot to me, sir.

39:17.640 --> 39:21.760
I've written a lot of letters
to the next of kin.

39:23.280 --> 39:27.400
Nothing ever seems like it's enough.
They deserve more.

39:28.320 --> 39:31.120
This is something more.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.560
Thank you, sir.

39:40.520 --> 39:46.240
There is one thing, General, that's still
missing that could make a difference.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.960
I'll take care of it.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.000
Hey.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.040
Come in, come in.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.800
Daniel, this is my wife, Marci.

40:15.880 --> 40:19.240
Hi. I'd love to give you a hug, but...

40:19.320 --> 40:21.920
Please, don't get up.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.200
This is my daughter.

40:24.280 --> 40:27.160
- She is beautiful.
- Thanks.

40:28.400 --> 40:32.280
- I guess that ultrasound was wrong, huh?
- Yeah.

40:32.360 --> 40:35.160
What's her name?

40:35.960 --> 40:37.760
Janet.

40:40.160 --> 40:42.560
That's nice.

40:58.160 --> 41:00.240
OK, guys... Tom.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.480
Emmett.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.920
- You ready?
- Rolling.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.560
Sound?

41:05.640 --> 41:08.560
OK. First question.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.280
OK.
