00:38.705 --> 00:40.415

Why is no one
talking about poor Thane?"

01:02.813 --> 01:06.483
Reggie was victimized
by institutional racism.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.277
Thane was killed by gravity.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.906
I never intended
for any of that to happen.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.783
Yet, you still said nothing.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.578
So now I'm supposed to feel guilty
for something you did?

01:59.661 --> 02:02.164
Well, how about feeling guilty
about something you did?

02:02.247 --> 02:04.458
What is that supposed to mean?

02:04.541 --> 02:06.460

02:13.467 --> 02:14.926
Thanks a lot.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.429
I never blamed you for making that call.

02:17.512 --> 02:18.805
I would have done the same...

02:18.889 --> 02:21.975
if crowds and that "whoo-hoo" sound
people make

02:22.059 --> 02:23.977

in front of people.

-Same as "but."

to get a quote

-from Gabe about AP's impromptu trial.
-Gabe didn't really feel like talking

03:03.058 --> 03:05.560

against him loudly.

So make him feel like talking.
Do your job.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.356
[exhales] What does it matter?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.525
I wrote a story about a cop
using excessive force,

03:11.608 --> 03:12.901
and somehow Reggie gets blamed.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.446
Then I write a story about a cop
overreacting to a benign phone call,

03:16.530 --> 03:19.199
and everyone gets mad at the guy
who made the call, which is insane.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.576

-Ugh.
-Hear me out.

who's one of the good ones--
and show even he's a victim

03:37.384 --> 03:39.302
to the same system as a kid like Reggie,

03:39.386 --> 03:41.221
maybe people will see
this is a real problem.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.098
Troy's a legacy kid
and student body president.

-Already on it.

I was supposed to cover it,

what if I turned my parade story
into a story about you?

Not a single racist got a pardon

and you promoted fire safety.
Way to go.

You know, floats and marching bands and...

actually, celebration of any kind
just doesn't seem like your thing.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.203

Aw, shit.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.965
You should have caught that.

09:09.049 --> 09:13.219
Sorry.
Your face looks all serious and cute.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.307
Pithy speech, Troy.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.850
Could use you on the <i>Pastiche </i>staff.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.560
Yeah, it's the least you could do,

considering how much
Troy has done for you.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.815
Sam, please, I don't think I can survive
such a hostile learning environment.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.150
I think I need a safe space.

09:27.233 --> 09:31.029
Where will you ever find anyone
who can relate to your experiences?

09:31.112 --> 09:33.448
God, our repartee is magic.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.617
We'd really make a dynamic duo, hmm?

09:38.328 --> 09:40.330
Sure, walk away.

I have a feeling
we'll be seeing her byline

-What was that about?
-Nothing.

Sure. Take all the time you need.

I don't actually need your permission.

[Reggie] I don't know
why you're being weird.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.210
[Sam] I'm not being weird.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.254
[Reggie] After last night,
we had a moment.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.257
[Sam] You're my brother. I...

10:32.340 --> 10:33.258
[Reggie] What do you--

10:33.341 --> 10:34.884
[Sam] Look.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.386
We both got caught up.

Yeah, I... you know I'm not 21.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.167
Yeah, neither am I.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.670
But this is when people
not being able to tell us apart

11:10.753 --> 11:11.963
comes in handy.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.642
-Mr. T.
-[Troy] Hey, hey.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.060
[man] Welcome back.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.396
Who's your pint-sized friend?

11:28.980 --> 11:30.231
Wait. Oh, my God. I know you.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.525
[chuckles] I-I don't think so.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.570
Yes, I do. Don't make me prove it.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.782
Kind of new to this.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.367
Avid reader.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.036
I love "Smash Bros."

11:43.119 --> 11:45.288
That's a video game, not a euphemism.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.956
Adorbs!

11:47.040 --> 11:48.583
I'm just gonna put you in my pocket.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.418
-Little pocket pal.
-[Troy chuckles]

11:50.501 --> 11:51.878
Lionel here is my roommate.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.296
His very embarrassed roommate.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.964
Girl, please. I used to be you.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.549
-Huh?
-Yeah.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.886
We were roommates freshman year,
but AJ dropped out.

11:59.969 --> 12:04.724
I'm not the Ivy type, but I do enjoy
the Ivy tuition my folks keep sending.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.560
I plan on telling them
after I pay off my mustang.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.605
-Nice car.
-No. My horse.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.065
He's a mustang.

12:17.028 --> 12:20.073
Winchester feels so far from here.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.783
Winchester's not so bad.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.410
For you. You're student body president.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.163
-Your father's the dean.
-Oh, what's the point?

12:27.246 --> 12:28.581
You know, with the blackface party

12:28.665 --> 12:30.500
and the Reggie thing, I feel useless.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.876
We all do.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.421
Everyone at AP thinks I'm just
a mouthpiece for the administration.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.965
Or a fucking mascot,

12:37.048 --> 12:40.593
and not the fun kind that gets
to fire off T-shirts in front of people.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.595
That's why I come here.

12:43.721 --> 12:47.517
Here, I'm just a guy having a drink
with his homeboy, Willie Evans.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.686
That's the guy on your ID.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.770
Oh.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.900
You know my dad hasn't
wished me happy birthday in three years?

12:55.984 --> 12:59.320
Whoa. When was it?

12:59.404 --> 13:00.822
A week ago.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.450
Silver lining...

13:05.785 --> 13:09.289
At least you have a dad you can blame
for screwing you up.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.583
My dad died before I turned six.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.753
Not like he was around much
before then anyway.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.715
And so he just left your family?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.217
He wouldn't leave his other family.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.094
Wow.

13:23.845 --> 13:26.264
So you didn't have a man around
to show you what's what?

13:26.347 --> 13:27.557
Yep.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.767
Which is why I chose to be gay.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.186
Kidding. That's not how it works.

13:32.270 --> 13:35.565
No, I know that. Teletubbies turned you.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.483
That and the lack of prayer in schools.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.609
[chuckles]

13:43.948 --> 13:45.450
My mom left when I was a kid.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.454
-I'm sorry she left.
-[Troy] If my dad's

13:49.537 --> 13:50.872
as tough a husband as he is a father,

13:50.955 --> 13:52.165
I don't blame her.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.251
I know my dad's trying to protect me

13:55.335 --> 13:57.879
from all the bullshit he's faced
as a black man,

13:57.962 --> 14:01.174
but, fuck, perfection is suffocating.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.887
I mean, sometimes I just want
to pack up all my stuff

14:05.970 --> 14:07.263
in the middle of the night,

14:08.181 --> 14:10.183
throw away my phone and just leave.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.352
Never speak to him again.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.168
Neika.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.795
Ah.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.838
Actually, it's Professor Hobbs.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.423
Nice to meet you.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.467
Officially, no one
who's here legally has met me.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.260
Unofficially, it's nice to meet you, too.

14:46.344 --> 14:50.807
I... I tried to get into your class,
but it was full.

14:50.890 --> 14:51.724
Hmm.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.726
[Troy] Professor Hobbs is very popular.

14:53.810 --> 14:57.105
It's because she's so good
at everything she does.

14:57.188 --> 15:00.566
[Neika] Okay, Troy, how much have you had?
You need to eat something.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.276
[whispering] Professor Hobbs,
not in front of Lionel.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.779
We're not coming here again.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.406
It took me 15 minutes to park.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.074
I told you we should Uber, baby.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.035
[Monique] Why?
You're the only one drinking.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.246
-Why do you think that is?
-[Troy] It's true.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.914
She does love her tequila.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.417
I'm assuming.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.002
[Monique] Are we gonna spend
the entire night with your students?

15:20.086 --> 15:24.215
I think you need to calm down.
It's good to see you, Mr. Fairbanks.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.425
Let's go, baby.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.468
Hmm.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.556
I'm not exactly fluent,

15:31.639 --> 15:34.725
but was that straight for, "I'd hit that"?

15:34.809 --> 15:36.519
Or, "I already hit that"?

15:36.602 --> 15:38.354
-[chuckles]
-What?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.815
But she's faculty.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.108
And she has a fiancée.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.569
And she's... gay.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.820
No, she's not when she's with me.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.114
-What about Coco?
-What about Coco?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.825
Look, am I here with Coco,
or am I here with you?

15:50.908 --> 15:52.201

15:52.285 --> 15:54.245

Or you could just come in with me.

What?

17:22.917 --> 17:24.460
Yeah, I was supposed
to meet someone else here,

17:24.544 --> 17:26.504
but he didn't show, so...

17:28.506 --> 17:30.841
So... you want me to...

17:30.925 --> 17:32.552
Unless you don't want to.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.064

By the urinal. Classy.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.117
I didn't say stop.

I don't want you doing anything

It's okay.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.372

I feel I can trust.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.691
Oh, I know, I know.

Troy used to ask me too, but...

19:12.401 --> 19:14.820
my piss hasn't been clean since I was 13.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.243
I'm not sure about this.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.080
Last call always comes too fucking early.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.916
Besides, you said
it's a 25-year-old scotch.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.584
It'd be a crime not to drink it.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.587
Actually, I think breaking and entering
would be the crime.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.760
Okay, here it is. There's some Adderall.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.470
And... I don't know what that is.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.514
I know what that is. Don't touch that.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.411
I'll get you your article on the parade.
It was pretty uneventful.

Kurt Fletcher and <i>Pastiche</i>
handed out their latest issue.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.709
I wouldn't exactly call that uneventful.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.711
People have been snapping
and tweeting about it.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.797
And you weren't there to cover any of it
because you're on, what? A date?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.340
I wouldn't call it that.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.218

20:19.301 --> 20:20.928

-Were you spying on us?
-Yes.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.361

-From, like, the Earth.
