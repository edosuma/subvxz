00:07.884 --> 00:08.950
This week on Vice:

00:08.986 --> 00:13.388
the battle raging in
Nigeria over control of oil.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.074

00:22.032 --> 00:24.966
This is just a stream of fuel

00:25.002 --> 00:26.601
going out into the waterways.

00:26.637 --> 00:29.437
This entire town has been flooded.

00:29.472 --> 00:33.642
And then, scientists team
up to save the world's reefs.

00:35.145 --> 00:38.546
Can you describe what the world
looks like without coral reefs?

00:38.581 --> 00:41.215
If we don't mitigate at
all, coral reefs will not be

00:41.251 --> 00:42.883
the thing that we're worrying about.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.686
It will be the survival of our species.

00:52.562 --> 00:53.961
Go, go, go!

00:56.558 --> 00:58.058
We are not animals!

01:09.538 --> 01:12.239
Nigeria is Africa's
largest oil producer.

01:12.274 --> 01:13.940
For over half a century,

01:13.975 --> 01:16.476
fossil fuel companies and
the Nigerian government

01:16.512 --> 01:19.045
have collectively made
billions of dollars,

01:19.080 --> 01:20.813
but the wealth has not trickled down

01:20.849 --> 01:22.149
to the majority of the population.

01:22.184 --> 01:24.951
This has led not only
to an armed rebellion,

01:24.986 --> 01:27.219
but also local people stealing oil

01:27.255 --> 01:28.955
and sabotaging infrastructure

01:28.990 --> 01:31.691
to reclaim what they felt
was rightfully theirs.

01:31.726 --> 01:33.526
In season one of Vice,

01:33.561 --> 01:35.194
we traveled to the
heart of the Niger Delta,

01:35.229 --> 01:37.463
the epicenter of their oil production.

01:37.498 --> 01:41.834
So, right behind me are
three illegal oil refineries.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.405
Now at that time, an amnesty

01:46.440 --> 01:49.007
between the government and
militants had been in place,

01:49.043 --> 01:50.709
bringing relative peace to the region.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.724
But in 2016, the newly
elected president,

01:53.725 --> 01:55.881
suspended the amnesty program

01:55.916 --> 01:59.518
prompting a resurgence of
oil piracy and militancy.

01:59.554 --> 02:02.921
So, we sent Gianna Toboni
back to the Niger Delta

02:02.956 --> 02:04.923
to follow this ongoing story.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.776
We're riding through the
Niger Delta right now.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.213
Nigeria's oil reserves are under us,

02:28.248 --> 02:30.881
so we're right at the center
of Nigeria's oil production.

02:30.917 --> 02:33.617
Shell, Exxon... all these
big companies have pipelines,

02:33.652 --> 02:37.454
and this is where oil theft is rampant.

02:37.489 --> 02:39.957
Illegal oil refineries are
buried deep in the creeks

02:39.992 --> 02:43.560
of the Niger Delta and are
notoriously difficult to get to.

02:43.596 --> 02:46.130
Local oil businessman Don Wizaro

02:46.165 --> 02:47.865
helped us secure access to one

02:47.900 --> 02:49.833
under the protection
of a paramilitary group

02:49.868 --> 02:52.168
that provides security
for the oil thieves.

03:00.779 --> 03:02.912
This looks post-apocalyptic out here.

03:02.948 --> 03:04.615
I mean, everything is
burnt to the ground.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.883
This entire town is black.

03:13.859 --> 03:17.761
Oh, man. The smell of
oil here is overwhelming.

03:17.796 --> 03:22.398
Everything's rotting. I mean,
this entire town is covered in oil.

03:26.404 --> 03:27.470
What are these guys doing?

03:32.343 --> 03:33.542
That's the refining in there?

03:46.824 --> 03:48.623
So, this diesel is ready to be sold now.

04:02.038 --> 04:03.938
So, they're just
starting to pump the crude

04:03.973 --> 04:05.307
from the ship through these hoses

04:05.342 --> 04:07.409
into what they're
calling the crude oven.

04:08.512 --> 04:11.212
That's where the
refining process happens.

04:11.247 --> 04:13.447
And then it goes through
these pipes into the cooler...

04:13.482 --> 04:14.982
they use water to cool it down...

04:15.018 --> 04:17.185
and then through these
pipes into the reservoir.

04:17.220 --> 04:18.652
That's the diesel there.

04:19.956 --> 04:22.290
Then they pump it
again into those drums,

04:22.325 --> 04:24.458
and that's where it's exported from.

04:27.297 --> 04:28.730
Just a couple of years ago,

04:28.731 --> 04:30.698
operations like these
were on the decline,

04:30.733 --> 04:32.633
in part due to an amnesty program

04:32.668 --> 04:34.635
where the Nigerian
government paid militants

04:34.670 --> 04:37.971
to stop refining and selling
the oil beneath their land.

04:39.141 --> 04:43.444
But in 2016, the new government
reeled back those subsidies,

04:43.479 --> 04:46.313
so now, the black market
is once again thriving.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.183
Why do you do this work?

04:59.895 --> 05:01.961
Has the military ever come through here?

05:08.370 --> 05:10.436
As night fell, they allowed us to watch

05:10.472 --> 05:13.573
the most crucial and
dangerous part of the process.

05:13.608 --> 05:16.108
Oh wow. They just started the fire.

05:16.143 --> 05:17.443
Look at this.

05:17.479 --> 05:19.444
Holy shit. Huge plumes of smoke.

05:25.286 --> 05:28.220
I mean, this fire is huge,
and all these guys are here,

05:28.256 --> 05:31.123
making sure they contain it,
'cause we're surrounded by oil.

05:31.158 --> 05:34.293
This is the most combustible
environment you could be in.

05:44.638 --> 05:46.004
What are they pouring in there?

06:09.361 --> 06:12.996
So hot. I mean, this fire
is relatively far away,

06:13.032 --> 06:16.099
and the heat is just...
the heat is really strong.

06:17.369 --> 06:20.003
Holy shit! Look at this
thing. It's massive.

06:21.707 --> 06:23.206
So, they do this every night, huh?

06:24.176 --> 06:25.242
Yeah.

06:34.753 --> 06:36.253
While Nigeria sits atop

06:36.288 --> 06:38.188
one of the largest oil
reserves in the world,

06:38.223 --> 06:40.290
the majority of the Nigerian people

06:40.326 --> 06:43.827
have seen little benefit from
this multi-billion dollar industry.

06:44.796 --> 06:47.096
The result has been rampant oil theft

06:47.131 --> 06:48.965
and sabotage of infrastructure,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
which has transnational
oil and gas consultants,

06:51.035 --> 06:52.469
like Ifeanyi Izeze,

06:52.504 --> 06:55.204
concerned about the effects
on global oil markets.

06:55.239 --> 06:58.941
What is Nigeria's role in
oil production globally?

07:13.794 --> 07:15.223
What was the amnesty program?

07:44.687 --> 07:46.454
Why have people turned to violence?

07:56.799 --> 08:00.601
Militant activity reduced
Nigeria's oil output last year

08:00.637 --> 08:03.703
to its lowest level in 22 years.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.208
And as we saw in a local village,

08:08.244 --> 08:12.379
the illegal oil market is once
again central to their livelihood.

08:12.415 --> 08:14.648
We have the whole
village coming with us.

08:55.456 --> 08:57.556
If you could get a job,
would you be doing this?

09:10.571 --> 09:11.669
Just two days later,

09:11.705 --> 09:14.606
the Nigerian military
raided the very same village.

09:23.283 --> 09:26.751
So, they're coming to
bust this dump site.

09:26.786 --> 09:30.387
Oh look. They're just
destroying everything.

09:34.794 --> 09:37.028
Oh my God. You can smell it.

09:37.063 --> 09:39.463
Look at this. Jesus.

09:53.979 --> 09:56.313
So, tell us what's happening here.

10:02.688 --> 10:04.788
You can tell that it was
refined out in the bush?

10:06.759 --> 10:08.424
So, how often are you coming across

10:08.460 --> 10:11.662
warehouses or markets that
are selling illegal fuel?

10:22.822 --> 10:24.707
This can't be good for the environment.

10:29.481 --> 10:30.547
And why is that?

10:43.928 --> 10:46.095
Oh my God. Oh my God.

10:48.032 --> 10:51.233
Just slashing all these bags up.

10:51.268 --> 10:53.702
I mean, look at this,
though. This is just a stream

10:53.737 --> 10:56.638
of fuel going out into the waterways.

10:56.673 --> 10:59.108
This entire town has been flooded.

10:59.143 --> 11:01.143
After years of military raids,

11:01.178 --> 11:03.645
illegal oil operations,
and pipeline spills,

11:03.680 --> 11:07.082
the effect on the local
environment here is catastrophic,

11:07.117 --> 11:09.517
contaminating what was
a main source of fishing,

11:09.552 --> 11:12.186
agriculture, and drinking water.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.293
So, you just threw your
net in to catch fish,

11:19.329 --> 11:20.862
and it's covered in oil now?

11:38.813 --> 11:40.147
This isn't just a result of the war

11:40.182 --> 11:42.215
between the militants
and the government.

11:42.251 --> 11:44.885
In 2011, a landmark UN report showed

11:44.920 --> 11:47.220
widespread contamination
of the Niger Delta

11:47.256 --> 11:50.124
by Shell and other oil companies.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.470
I noticed that it's black all around us.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.805
What has been the
effect on this community?

12:12.547 --> 12:14.413
In 2015, after being sued

12:14.448 --> 12:16.883
by a local community
affected by oil spills,

12:16.918 --> 12:19.518
Shell agreed to a payout of $84 million

12:19.554 --> 12:21.487
and maintains that it's committed

12:21.522 --> 12:23.622
to the cleanup of oil
in the Niger Delta.

12:23.658 --> 12:26.292
There have been several other
lawsuits against Shell here,

12:26.327 --> 12:28.294
a number of which are still pending.

12:29.963 --> 12:32.998
We went on an aerial patrol with
Shell's pipeline surveillance team,

12:33.033 --> 12:35.401
who believe that it's the
oil thieves and militants

12:35.436 --> 12:38.537
who are largely responsible
for this widespread pollution.

12:45.745 --> 12:46.978
What is this right here?

12:54.507 --> 12:56.188
Oh wow. Look at that. That's a big one.

12:56.223 --> 12:57.823
Oh my God! They're everywhere.

12:57.858 --> 12:59.891
Oh my God! Another one.

13:12.405 --> 13:15.840
So, these bush refineries were
just set on fire by the military.

13:15.875 --> 13:19.409
You can see two areas
close by that are burning.

13:19.445 --> 13:23.247
The plumes of smoke are black
and massive, going into the sky.

13:24.751 --> 13:26.917
As we found out for ourselves,

13:26.953 --> 13:29.342
operations to destroy illegal refineries

13:29.343 --> 13:31.421
are routine for the Nigerian military.

13:36.362 --> 13:38.729
The civil defense forces just went in.

13:38.764 --> 13:41.998
It looks like they're firing
at the militants in there.

13:44.136 --> 13:46.136
So, they just arrested somebody.

13:46.171 --> 13:49.038
He was running an oil
refinery right over here.

13:57.149 --> 14:00.817
There are several ovens
here. Oh my God. Look at this.

14:00.852 --> 14:02.852
It goes all the way down there.

14:02.888 --> 14:05.789
I mean, it's like, probably,
half a mile of refineries.

14:18.801 --> 14:20.770
So you'll destroy these now?

14:22.072 --> 14:24.173
This entire camp is being lit on fire.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.708
You can see the smoke
in the sky already.

14:28.913 --> 14:31.046
These guys are all about to fire...

14:33.417 --> 14:34.416
Okay.

14:48.632 --> 14:50.298
As the government
continues their assault

14:50.334 --> 14:53.201
on illegal refineries and
barges carrying stolen oil,

14:53.236 --> 14:55.970
they're often met with
retaliation from local militias.

14:56.005 --> 14:58.574
and one of the most
notorious militias here.

14:58.575 --> 15:00.375
is the Niger Delta Avengers

15:00.409 --> 15:02.343
They attack pipelines
and infrastructure,

15:02.378 --> 15:05.947
significantly affecting both
the environment and the economy.

15:07.884 --> 15:11.585
It's been incredibly hard getting any
militants from the NDA to talk to us,

15:11.620 --> 15:13.286
but we've finally tracked a few down

15:13.322 --> 15:14.755
who have agreed to talk to us

15:14.790 --> 15:16.557
as long as we conceal their identities.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.362
Why are you doing this? What
do you want to accomplish?

15:47.922 --> 15:50.956
What kinds of missions
does the NDA carry out?

16:08.442 --> 16:10.209
These attacks forced the government

16:10.244 --> 16:12.677
to resume amnesty
payouts to the militants,

16:12.713 --> 16:14.613
and the government
also recently announced

16:14.648 --> 16:17.849
a move toward legalizing
these illicit refineries.

16:19.685 --> 16:22.120
Despite that, the attacks
and protests continue

16:22.155 --> 16:25.023
as locals demand more
jobs and development,

16:25.058 --> 16:27.426
without which there
may be no end in sight

16:27.461 --> 16:29.795
for the devastating environmental damage

16:29.830 --> 16:33.331
and the escalating cycle of
violence in the Niger Delta.

16:38.004 --> 16:39.703
Coral reefs are one of the Earth's

16:39.739 --> 16:41.839
most precious natural resources.

16:41.874 --> 16:43.674
They harbor over a million species

16:43.709 --> 16:46.811
and provide food for at
least 500 million people

16:46.846 --> 16:48.379
around the world.

16:48.415 --> 16:50.648
But corals are dying
at an alarming rate,

16:50.683 --> 16:52.716
primarily due to
rising sea temperatures.

16:52.752 --> 16:55.218
Most experts believe
that we're set to lose

16:55.254 --> 16:58.221
90 percent of the world's reefs by 2050.

16:58.257 --> 17:01.692
Ben Anderson traveled to
Palau, Hawaii, and Curacao

17:01.727 --> 17:04.294
to see how a few small
groups of scientists

17:04.329 --> 17:05.963
may have found a solution

17:05.998 --> 17:08.897
to this increasingly
serious environmental crisis.

17:35.694 --> 17:38.194
Their habitats still look beautiful,

17:38.229 --> 17:40.964
but corals are dying
at a staggering rate.

17:42.266 --> 17:44.933
Warming waters,
pollution, and overfishing

17:44.969 --> 17:48.137
have led to the loss of 50
percent of the world's corals

17:48.172 --> 17:50.006
in the last 30 years.

17:56.247 --> 17:57.779
If this is allowed to continue,

17:57.815 --> 18:00.782
its impact on the planet
will be devastating.

18:02.052 --> 18:04.419
Reef ecologist Eric
Hochberg and his team

18:04.454 --> 18:07.923
want to prove exactly
why this is happening.

18:07.958 --> 18:11.092
They have been photographing
major reefs around the world

18:11.128 --> 18:13.328
and are finishing their
project here in Palau.

18:15.132 --> 18:18.333
These underwater tests are conducted
to verify information gathered

18:18.368 --> 18:23.304
by a state-of-the-art NASA sensor
attached to the team's plane.

18:25.015 --> 18:26.781
Is your hope that once this is done,

18:26.816 --> 18:29.117
you can then understand what's damaging

18:29.152 --> 18:30.685
each reef in each
different part of the world?

18:30.720 --> 18:34.889
Or is it also to understand
what could prevent further loss?

18:34.924 --> 18:36.891
Yes and yes. So, we're gonna visit

18:36.926 --> 18:38.726
hundreds of reefs with the airplane.

18:38.761 --> 18:40.260
I'm gonna look for patterns.

18:40.296 --> 18:42.062
This is an exploratory science.

18:42.098 --> 18:43.764
First time we're getting this data set,

18:43.800 --> 18:45.566
so we don't know what we'll find.

18:46.870 --> 18:49.203
When the project is finished,
they will have mapped

18:49.238 --> 18:51.938
more of the world's coral
reefs than ever before.

18:56.412 --> 18:59.346
This is the leading-edge sensor

18:59.382 --> 19:02.016
for ocean remote sensing in the world.

19:02.051 --> 19:04.684
This is PRISM. We have
it here. We're using it.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.921
So far, the amount of
reef that's been studied

19:07.956 --> 19:10.891
this comprehensively is
point-zero-one percent of the world's.

19:10.926 --> 19:11.858
That's what I would say.

19:11.894 --> 19:14.127
So, we're gonna get
to about two percent.

19:14.162 --> 19:16.997
The only way to do it
is with this technology.

19:17.032 --> 19:19.432
I'm amazed this hasn't been done before.

19:19.467 --> 19:22.035
When you think of something
so valuable and so...

19:22.070 --> 19:24.603
It's been done at Mars, and
it's been done at the Moon.

19:24.639 --> 19:26.205
We just haven't done it here on Earth.

19:26.241 --> 19:27.440
Exactly.

19:32.547 --> 19:35.014
This is the most extensive

19:35.050 --> 19:37.883
uniform reef survey
that has been conducted.

19:42.423 --> 19:45.123
What's already known is that
corals are being stressed

19:45.159 --> 19:47.860
by extreme changes to their environment.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.996
When this happens, they lose
their algae and turn white

19:51.032 --> 19:53.631
in a phenomenon known as bleaching.

19:55.702 --> 19:59.637
There have been three worldwide
bleaching events in the last 20 years.

19:59.673 --> 20:02.474
The most devastating began in 2014,

20:02.509 --> 20:08.246
resulting in the loss of
4,600 square miles of coral.

20:08.282 --> 20:11.583
The Great Barrier Reef, the
world's largest living structure,

20:11.618 --> 20:13.585
lost 30 percent of its coral,

20:13.620 --> 20:17.321
threatening the many species
that rely on it for survival.

20:18.424 --> 20:20.357
Richard Vevers is a former ad exec

20:20.393 --> 20:23.061
who believes he can help
by raising awareness.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.296
He launched a project called 50 Reefs,

20:25.331 --> 20:27.431
which will identify and help document

20:27.467 --> 20:30.434
the 50 most protectable
reefs around the world.

20:38.478 --> 20:40.644
Working with Google,
Richard has designed

20:40.679 --> 20:43.346
a 360-degree virtual reality camera

20:43.381 --> 20:45.749
that can capture
remarkably detailed footage.

20:45.784 --> 20:50.220
The camera we developed
was originally an idea of...

20:50.255 --> 20:51.888
"Well, let's reveal
the underwater world."

20:51.924 --> 20:54.491
The scientists heard about the camera

20:54.526 --> 20:57.360
and saw that this was a way
of potentially revolutionizing

20:57.395 --> 20:59.029
the study of coral reefs.

20:59.064 --> 21:02.898
Richard's footage is detailed
enough for scientific study,

21:02.934 --> 21:05.067
and his team has designed an algorithm

21:05.103 --> 21:07.170
that automatically analyzes the images,

21:07.205 --> 21:09.657
which means work that
would've taken years

21:09.658 --> 21:11.274
can now be completed in hours.

21:11.309 --> 21:14.410
And is your footage available
to the scientific community?

21:14.446 --> 21:16.946
It is literally Google
Street View underwater,

21:16.981 --> 21:19.158
so anybody in the world can go to

21:19.159 --> 21:20.650
any of the locations that we've been to.

21:20.685 --> 21:24.987
The idea is these 50 reefs
become a catalyst for action.

21:26.991 --> 21:30.126
The 50 Reefs team also take
their underwater imagery

21:30.161 --> 21:35.164
and, with VR headsets, show local
communities what they have to lose.

21:35.199 --> 21:38.733
A lot of these local
communities don't get underwater.

21:38.769 --> 21:41.270
And so, with this technology,
we can come into villages

21:41.305 --> 21:43.772
and show people exactly
what's under there.

21:43.807 --> 21:45.440
Wow!

21:51.128 --> 21:54.428
And is the idea to get them
to love what they see first

21:54.464 --> 21:56.965
and then be more
interested in protecting it?

21:57.000 --> 21:58.566
Yes. I mean, you can
have that one moment

21:58.601 --> 22:02.403
when you're growing up, when you
see something new for the first time,

22:02.438 --> 22:04.305
and it sticks with you
for the rest of your life.

22:04.340 --> 22:06.940
You can't protect an
environment like this

22:06.976 --> 22:09.510
without a hundred percent local support.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.246
Coral reefs are the foundation

22:12.282 --> 22:15.048
of the world's underwater ecosystems.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.285
If they die, so will the many species

22:17.320 --> 22:20.087
that depend on them, and
the entire food chain,

22:20.122 --> 22:22.956
up to the fish that we
consume, could be lost.

22:22.992 --> 22:26.160
Does it surprise you that
this isn't front-page news,

22:26.195 --> 22:28.896
that this isn't more of an urgent
issue to most of the public?

22:28.931 --> 22:31.098
People still seem sort of obsessed

22:31.133 --> 22:33.133
with conservation of a single species.

22:33.169 --> 22:38.605
Yet we've got a million species
under a more rapid threat

22:38.640 --> 22:40.674
that's happening right now.

22:40.709 --> 22:45.512
And I think most conservation
needs a bit of a rethink.

22:45.547 --> 22:47.843
One of the world's
leading marine biologists

22:47.844 --> 22:49.115
is doing just that,

22:49.150 --> 22:52.885
pioneering research which
could help coral survive.

22:52.921 --> 22:54.554
You know, one thing that we're exploring

22:54.589 --> 22:56.755
is that corals might
be more entrepreneurial

22:56.791 --> 22:58.090
in terms of their partners

22:58.126 --> 23:00.092
very early in their life history.

23:00.128 --> 23:01.393
We try to challenge them

23:01.429 --> 23:02.862
with new types and see if they're...

23:02.897 --> 23:04.396
"Oh yeah, I'll give this one a try."

23:04.432 --> 23:08.301
Put the right sperm and egg
together and create the...

23:08.336 --> 23:10.303
- the super coral.
- Yeah.

23:10.338 --> 23:13.872
She calls this process
"assisted evolution."

23:18.713 --> 23:21.279
Once Ruth has identified
the strongest species

23:21.315 --> 23:23.248
in the lab and helped them breed,

23:23.283 --> 23:25.050
the samples are placed amongst reefs

23:25.085 --> 23:27.018
that have already been badly damaged.

23:28.655 --> 23:30.055
These corals were selected,

23:30.090 --> 23:33.225
because one coral of the same species,

23:33.260 --> 23:35.293
sitting side-by-side,

23:35.329 --> 23:38.429
one of them was healthy and
one of them was white bleached.

23:38.465 --> 23:39.898
And our question is, "Why?"

23:39.933 --> 23:43.134
So, these are the ones that
are really the survivors.

24:08.327 --> 24:10.895
You know, I always think of
the planet as a jigsaw puzzle,

24:10.930 --> 24:14.765
and there are all these
pieces that must fit together

24:14.800 --> 24:16.533
to create the picture
that is our planet.

24:16.568 --> 24:18.869
And when you start pulling pieces out,

24:18.904 --> 24:22.005
like the coral reef
or the polar ice sheet,

24:22.040 --> 24:24.808
and that lack of
connection and understanding

24:24.843 --> 24:27.844
of the way the planet's
system is being affected

24:27.880 --> 24:30.213
will ultimately wipe
us out as a species.

24:30.248 --> 24:33.483
Species go extinct
when they can no longer

24:33.519 --> 24:36.219
be supported by the
place where they live.

24:36.254 --> 24:38.721
And that's what we're
doing to ourselves.

24:38.756 --> 24:40.489
Back in Ruth's lab,

24:40.525 --> 24:43.226
she uses a multi-million
dollar microscope

24:43.261 --> 24:44.860
which shows in stunning detail

24:44.896 --> 24:47.863
exactly how corals react
to increasing stresses.

24:47.899 --> 24:50.266
That's the first time I've seen
them where you can really see

24:50.302 --> 24:51.834
that they're living things.

24:51.869 --> 24:53.135
You're almost communicating
with the corals,

24:53.170 --> 24:56.071
'cause you can push it until
you see levels of stress...

24:56.106 --> 24:58.240
- That's right.
- ... and then pull it back in again.

24:58.275 --> 25:00.108
They tell you exactly what they feel.

25:00.144 --> 25:02.411
And that's... you know,
that's kind of crazy, isn't it?

25:02.447 --> 25:05.681
You're looking at a living organism.

25:05.716 --> 25:09.851
A reef would cross
its strongest members,

25:09.886 --> 25:13.322
naturally, over a 30- to 50-year period.

25:13.357 --> 25:15.523
We don't have 30 to 50 years.

25:15.559 --> 25:17.559
These images help Ruth experiment

25:17.594 --> 25:21.129
with ways to build stronger species.

25:21.165 --> 25:24.131
You know, originally this project
was called the Super Coral Project.

25:24.167 --> 25:25.633
Okay, I'm going out on the reef,

25:25.669 --> 25:28.235
I'm finding my best coral performers.

25:28.271 --> 25:29.637
I bring it into the lab,

25:29.673 --> 25:31.573
I train it on an environmental treadmill

25:31.608 --> 25:35.510
to improve its capacity to
withstand these temperatures.

25:35.545 --> 25:38.680
We then do what human athletes often do,

25:38.715 --> 25:41.548
which is to meet somebody in
the gym of the opposite sex

25:41.584 --> 25:44.251
and have extremely gifted offspring.

25:44.287 --> 25:46.920
And we do exactly the
same with our corals.

25:50.493 --> 25:53.160
There is an urgent, urgent problem

25:53.196 --> 25:56.663
that needs to be met with a
very, very creative solution.

25:56.699 --> 26:00.467
And I'll use an example, like,
the closure of the ozone hole.

26:00.503 --> 26:03.737
That was a radical change
in planetary behavior

26:03.772 --> 26:05.873
that enabled that to occur...

26:05.908 --> 26:07.741
and we all did it.

26:09.211 --> 26:12.379
Ruth's work is looking
like a viable solution,

26:12.414 --> 26:14.614
if it can be applied to scale.

26:14.649 --> 26:17.417
In Curacao, we met with
a team of scientists

26:17.452 --> 26:21.988
called SECORE who are trying to
solve the problem of scalability.

26:22.024 --> 26:24.891
They're here to gather the
larvae of a brain coral,

26:24.926 --> 26:28.761
their first step in a plan
to repopulate reefs worldwide.

26:56.069 --> 26:57.140
Yeah.

27:01.101 --> 27:03.294
Yeah.

27:07.935 --> 27:10.602
Once in the water, they
rely on the sea life

27:10.637 --> 27:12.537
to point them in the right direction.

27:28.788 --> 27:32.056
Once the butterfly fish have
identified the right corals,

27:32.092 --> 27:34.425
Dirk and his team cover them in tents

27:34.461 --> 27:37.761
to collect the sperm and eggs
which are about to be released.

27:56.181 --> 27:58.047
After they've collected enough samples,

27:58.083 --> 28:01.851
they need to get them back
to the lab for fertilization.

28:01.886 --> 28:04.841
In nature, the coral's
reproductive success rate

28:04.842 --> 28:06.856
is just point-two percent.

28:13.698 --> 28:17.466
It's a huge step in solving
the problem of scalability.

28:17.502 --> 28:18.801
So, how close are you to getting

28:18.837 --> 28:21.738
the potentially hundreds of
thousands of coral that are there

28:21.773 --> 28:25.108
to be hundreds of thousands
of coral in the ocean?

28:26.420 --> 28:27.843
Yeah.

28:34.652 --> 28:36.551
The next problem is how to spread

28:36.586 --> 28:38.954
these hundreds of
thousands of fertilized eggs

28:38.989 --> 28:41.523
across a wide area.

28:41.558 --> 28:45.660
These easily made cement tetrapods
are covered with coral larvae.

28:45.695 --> 28:49.764
The tetrapods can then be easily
distributed wherever they are needed,

28:49.799 --> 28:51.332
and the coral can grow.

28:51.368 --> 28:53.201
Once you've figured it out

28:53.236 --> 28:54.636
and once you know you
can do it to scale,

28:54.671 --> 28:57.104
all you have to do is get
enough of these somewhere

28:57.140 --> 29:01.876
that you can essentially push them
into the areas where they need to be.

29:01.911 --> 29:03.944
That's the idea, yeah. That's it.

29:03.980 --> 29:05.445
That's it.

29:05.481 --> 29:07.815
It's another huge step

29:07.850 --> 29:09.183
in finding a solution

29:09.218 --> 29:11.351
that can be applied
on a worldwide scale.

29:40.215 --> 29:42.248
- So, you have a blueprint.
- Yes.

29:42.283 --> 29:44.517
What would you actually
need to put that in place?

29:44.552 --> 29:46.820
- Resources. We need money.
- So, how much?

29:46.855 --> 29:50.023
A collective
hundred-million-dollar project

29:50.058 --> 29:51.824
that would create the networks,

29:51.859 --> 29:53.687
that would enable the science

29:53.688 --> 29:56.295
to be convened with
practitioners quickly.

29:57.699 --> 29:58.897
If the scale and cause

29:58.933 --> 30:01.800
of the corals' destruction
can be perfectly understood,

30:01.836 --> 30:05.338
if its most resilient species
can be selected or bred,

30:05.373 --> 30:07.340
and if those species can then be spread

30:07.375 --> 30:09.775
wherever they are needed
on a massive scale,

30:09.810 --> 30:11.777
these scientists may have solved

30:11.812 --> 30:15.180
one of the most significant
environmental problems of our age.

30:16.383 --> 30:18.016
Can you describe what
the world looks like

30:18.052 --> 30:20.919
- without coral reefs?
- A world without reefs is

30:20.955 --> 30:23.822
a world where there
are places without food,

30:23.858 --> 30:26.858
places where there's nowhere to live.

30:26.893 --> 30:32.731
They are critically important to
coastal security and economies.

30:32.766 --> 30:35.066
The rates of change in our environment

30:35.101 --> 30:38.637
are far outpacing the intrinsic capacity

30:38.672 --> 30:41.072
of coral reefs to survive.

30:41.107 --> 30:42.874
If we don't mitigate at all,

30:42.909 --> 30:45.877
coral reefs will not be the
thing that we're worrying about.

30:45.912 --> 30:48.612
It will be the survival of our species.

30:48.648 --> 30:50.414
This sounds like the perfect project

30:50.449 --> 30:51.949
crying out for someone
to come in and say,

30:51.985 --> 30:53.751
"Okay, I'm gonna
coordinate a global effort"

30:53.787 --> 30:55.286
- to do exactly what you're saying.
- Absolutely.

30:55.321 --> 31:00.123
How do we make these tools make a
difference on-site in many places?

31:00.159 --> 31:04.127
We have to be absolutely
functional in 10 years.

31:04.163 --> 31:08.799
We have to stop planning,
and we need to start doing.
