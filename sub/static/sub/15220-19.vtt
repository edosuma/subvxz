00:24.764 --> 00:28.067
Theorising that one could time-travel
within his own lifetime,

00:28.067 --> 00:31.671
Doctor Sam Beckett stepped into the
quantum leap accelerator

00:31.671 --> 00:33.740
and vanished.

00:38.611 --> 00:41.147
He woke to find himself trapped in
the past,

00:41.147 --> 00:43.716
facing mirror images that were not
his own...

00:44.717 --> 00:48.354
and driven by an unknown force to
change history for the better.

00:50.223 --> 00:54.160
His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,

00:54.160 --> 00:59.132
who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.

00:59.132 --> 01:02.802
And so Doctor Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:02.802 --> 01:06.239
striving to put right what once went
wrong,

01:06.239 --> 01:11.611
and hoping each time that his next
leap...will be the leap home.

01:21.287 --> 01:25.158
Wait a minute!
There's been some kind of a mistake.

01:25.158 --> 01:28.494
You're the one who made the mistake,
Jesus.

01:28.494 --> 01:29.729
No. Jesus? No.

01:29.729 --> 01:32.298
Just try to think of someplace
far away. What?

01:36.269 --> 01:40.840
Let it be known
that on the 12th day of May 1971

01:40.840 --> 01:42.976
in the presence of these witnesses,

01:42.976 --> 01:47.413
that Jesus Ortega was condemned by
the State of Florida to death

01:47.413 --> 01:49.015
by electrocution...

01:51.417 --> 01:52.785
Oh, God!

03:08.261 --> 03:10.296
(GUARD DOG BARKS)

03:19.539 --> 03:22.675
..for the murder of Father Vincent
Torelli on the ninth day of...

03:22.675 --> 03:25.912
No, wait a minute!
..1971.

03:27.714 --> 03:30.750
It is thereby agreed by all present
here...

(PHONE RINGS)

03:47.567 --> 03:49.602
(RINGING CONTINUES)

03:55.174 --> 03:57.010
(RINGING CONTINUES)

03:58.478 --> 04:00.046
The Warden.

04:01.414 --> 04:03.449
Yes, sir.

04:10.990 --> 04:15.428
You were just granted a 48-hour stay
of execution by the Governor,

04:15.428 --> 04:17.363
and so was Raul Casta.

04:17.363 --> 04:19.365
(CLAMOUR)

04:19.365 --> 04:21.767
We need some information! Please!

04:24.037 --> 04:27.440
We need to know what's going on!
This is why the state of Florida

04:27.440 --> 04:29.108
needs a new governor,

04:29.108 --> 04:32.946
one who is not afraid to bring
a convicted murderer to justice.

04:32.946 --> 04:36.249
Why did the Governor grant a stay?
Because he hasn't got the guts

04:36.249 --> 04:40.887
to stand up to the liberal,
bleeding-heart pressure group.

04:40.887 --> 04:43.323
Are you saying that if you're
elected Governor,

04:43.323 --> 04:45.858
you could?
You're damn right I could!

04:45.858 --> 04:50.129
You think he will stay the
executions of the other five?
Not if I've got anything to say!

04:50.129 --> 04:55.134
Listen, I will not allow murderers,
rapists and convicted criminals

04:55.134 --> 04:58.504
to go free. And you can quote me
on that!

04:58.504 --> 05:00.540
(CLAMOUR)

05:20.893 --> 05:23.930
Moody's gonna fry
whoever pulled this off for you...

05:25.732 --> 05:28.635
..in the same chair! (LAUGHS)

05:28.635 --> 05:31.571
Ignore him. You're alive,

05:31.571 --> 05:33.740
at least for the next 48 hours.

05:33.740 --> 05:36.009
How the hell did you do it, man?

05:36.009 --> 05:38.544
We're gonna call you Lazarus, man!

05:38.544 --> 05:40.580
Lazarus! (LAUGHS)

05:44.851 --> 05:49.289
You did it! We still have a chance.

05:51.190 --> 05:53.326
You're home.
 Forget where you lived?

05:59.699 --> 06:02.502
Or did Wohorski let a little current
ooze through?

06:02.869 --> 06:04.871
Are you OK, Ortega?

06:06.673 --> 06:08.741
Ortega?

06:09.342 --> 06:11.177
I said, are you OK?
He's terrific!

06:11.177 --> 06:15.615
For somebody who just got his chain
ripped off the Grim Reaper's door.

06:15.615 --> 06:17.150
Ain't that right, Ortega?

06:21.721 --> 06:24.457
Sorry about the boxes,
but you weren't expected back.

06:25.592 --> 06:28.361
I wouldn't work too hard on
unpacking.

06:28.361 --> 06:32.498
Two days go by real fast.

06:32.498 --> 06:34.567
(TURNS KEY IN LOCK)

06:35.268 --> 06:37.070
Real fast.

06:42.008 --> 06:44.043
They listened! (LAUGHS)

06:46.746 --> 06:48.781
They listened!

06:52.418 --> 06:58.091
Y-Y-You said that they'd listen to
their own laws.

06:59.859 --> 07:02.128
You were right.

07:02.128 --> 07:04.564
INMATE: Somebody shut him up!

07:04.564 --> 07:06.199
You were right!

07:06.199 --> 07:08.568
(SOBBING) All the time...

07:09.636 --> 07:11.671
All the books.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.875
You did it!

07:16.409 --> 07:18.444
Mi amigo!

07:21.114 --> 07:24.584
He wrote an appeal? What the hell
kind of an appeal

07:24.584 --> 07:26.653
could an illiterate Cuban write?

07:27.287 --> 07:31.391
All I get is that Ortega's appeal
has 'em digging through the files

07:31.391 --> 07:32.725
for some kind of evidence

07:32.725 --> 07:34.961
that he says was omitted from his
trial.

07:34.961 --> 07:36.763
What kind of evidence?

07:36.763 --> 07:39.966
We don't know, sir.
Come on, Rip. Come on, come on!

07:39.966 --> 07:43.136
Where the hell's Tearsa.
She knows all about this case.

07:43.136 --> 07:45.738
She's out at the prison
doing some paperwork.

07:45.738 --> 07:47.740
What was the appeal based on?

07:47.740 --> 07:50.977
Maybe that it only took us six days
to get him convicted.

07:50.977 --> 07:55.114
Herb, you don't get punished for not
wasting the taxpayers' money.

07:55.114 --> 07:57.884
Bowman's only doing this
to get the bleeding-heart vote.

07:57.884 --> 07:59.752
They're all liberals in this state.

07:59.752 --> 08:02.589
Not as many as there are
conservative! Come on!

08:04.757 --> 08:07.594
What the hell...was in that damn
appeal?

08:07.594 --> 08:10.029
We don't know.

08:10.029 --> 08:11.965
What could it have been?

08:11.965 --> 08:16.302
Something that Bowman felt strong
enough to issue a stay on.

08:16.302 --> 08:19.339
Look, Ortega has just spent the past
18 months

08:19.339 --> 08:21.307
going through a stack of old
law books.

08:21.307 --> 08:25.178
All that he could come up with
possibly is a technicality

08:25.178 --> 08:28.681
and that is all!
The priest identified Ortega and
Casta on his death bed.

08:28.681 --> 08:30.950
Two other witnesses put him
at the crime scene.

08:30.950 --> 08:34.621
What can he have? That's what
you were meant to find out! Come on!

08:34.621 --> 08:38.758
Ortega got a stay!
If he gets a mistrial,
Bowman will get the liberal vote,

08:38.758 --> 08:40.927
I will be tied up in court during
election.

08:40.927 --> 08:43.096
he will have me where he wants me!

08:43.096 --> 08:46.566
Look, look, if we did it by the
books, which we did,

08:46.566 --> 08:49.435
there's no problem.
We did it by the books, didn't we?

08:49.435 --> 08:52.839
We have nothing to worry about.
You two have nothing to worry about.

08:52.839 --> 08:57.076
I have $80,000 sunk into
a gubernatorial campaign.

08:57.076 --> 09:00.413
I intend to win! I'm going back to
the Governor's office.

09:00.413 --> 09:02.315
I'm gonna get a copy of the damn
appeal

09:02.315 --> 09:04.751
and find out what that technicality
is.

09:04.751 --> 09:08.187
We're gonna have those two fried
long before election day,

09:08.187 --> 09:10.323
I guarantee it.

09:13.626 --> 09:15.762
You'd better.

09:17.597 --> 09:19.632
You'd better.

09:25.872 --> 09:27.941
Are you writing the great American
novel?

09:27.941 --> 09:31.077
Where the hell have you been?
I almost died in the electric chair.

09:31.077 --> 09:35.014
Sam, it's not always so easy to find
you - What? I was in the chair!

09:35.014 --> 09:38.084
Where were you? It's not like you're
lost in a mall.

09:38.084 --> 09:40.620
You're lost in time!

09:40.620 --> 09:43.022
I got here as soon as I could.
I'm sorry.

09:43.022 --> 09:44.924
Did you find anything out about
Jesus?

09:44.924 --> 09:48.928
Well, he's out cold in the waiting
room. We can't revive him.

09:48.928 --> 09:52.699
Dr Beeks thinks that Jesus thinks
that he's already dead.

09:52.699 --> 09:56.002
So he's slipped into a kind of
comatose coma.

09:56.002 --> 09:58.371
Well, tell Beeks to bring him round!

09:58.371 --> 10:01.841
You can't just dump a bucket of
water on his head

10:01.841 --> 10:04.310
and say, 'Hey, get up!
You're not dead!

10:04.310 --> 10:07.480
You're just 25 years in the future.'

10:07.480 --> 10:11.284
These things take time, Sam.
We don't have a lot of time, Al.

10:15.121 --> 10:19.692
OK, let me just...get this thing
in the right mode.

10:21.461 --> 10:27.400
According to Ziggy, you die on the
14th of May 1971.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.637
That's...That's in two days.

10:30.637 --> 10:34.307
I got that, Al! Why?
Why? Why?

10:34.307 --> 10:38.645
Well, probably because you can't
live with 2,000 volts

10:38.645 --> 10:42.515
running through your body.
Why was Jesus executed?

10:42.515 --> 10:45.952
You and Raul were convicted for
robbery and murder.

10:45.952 --> 10:48.855
According to Ziggy, they admitted
robbing the church,

10:48.855 --> 10:51.324
but the deny killing the priest.

10:51.324 --> 10:53.826
So you're probably here because
they're innocent.

10:53.826 --> 10:57.764
But they got three eyewitnesses, Al,
including the dying priest,

10:57.764 --> 10:59.565
who put us both at the church.

10:59.565 --> 11:02.468
Plus tests would show the gun
they found in Jesus' apartment

11:02.468 --> 11:05.838
matches the gun used on the priest!
What if they're telling the truth?

11:05.838 --> 11:10.243
What if they did rob the church
but did not kill the priest?

11:10.243 --> 11:13.279
Ziggy says there's an 83 percent
probability of...

11:13.279 --> 11:16.149
So we figure out who murdered
the priest and saved my life.

11:16.149 --> 11:18.384
Jesus's life. No, my life!

11:18.384 --> 11:22.555
I was the one in that chair
and I'm the one who's gonna be in it

11:22.555 --> 11:27.126
unless I figure out what Jesus
couldn't. What you doing?
Rehearsing your press release?

11:29.429 --> 11:34.033
There's a counsellor here to see
you, Ortega. Bingo! A lawyer!

11:35.468 --> 11:38.204
I'm sorry, Ortega. Rules are rules.

11:50.950 --> 11:55.855
Good luck, amigo. Good luck.
Jesus, where you going, man?

12:05.698 --> 12:08.101
Oh! Look at this, Sam!

12:08.101 --> 12:10.637
If I had an attorney like that
when I was in court,

12:10.637 --> 12:12.872
I'd still be in court!

12:18.912 --> 12:21.581
We did it! We did it!

12:21.581 --> 12:23.650
Oh, Jesus! We have a chance!

12:23.650 --> 12:26.352
We've got a chance to stop Moody
from killing you and Raul.

12:26.352 --> 12:29.355
Theodore Moody, the district
attorney.

12:29.355 --> 12:32.225
The guy who was busting a gut
this morning. Yeah.

12:32.225 --> 12:34.360
If he ever found out I was helping
you,

12:34.360 --> 12:36.696
that'd be the end of little Tearsa
Lorrea,

12:36.696 --> 12:38.498
so fast it would make your head
spin.

12:38.498 --> 12:42.502
Tearsa Margareta Lorrea, aged 28
and single!

12:42.502 --> 12:45.305
Maybe you shouldn't be here, then.
I'm being careful.

12:45.305 --> 12:49.642
No, she isn't, Sam. If Moody finds
out, I'll tell him I'm pumping you
for information.

12:49.642 --> 12:52.178
Moody doesn't buy that.

12:52.178 --> 12:55.415
In fact he was disbarred in '72 for
immoral conduct.

12:55.415 --> 12:58.084
I can't be worried about this now,
about me.

12:58.084 --> 13:02.889
Not when we're this close to proving
you and Raul are innocent! Here!

13:02.889 --> 13:06.292
She doesn't prove anything. She ends
up dong life as a social worker

13:06.292 --> 13:08.061
in a Florida unemployment office

13:08.061 --> 13:11.064
and you - I mean, Jesus - and
Raul...

13:11.064 --> 13:13.700
..still burn in the chair.

13:24.789 --> 13:27.125
This is exactly what we've been
working for.

13:27.125 --> 13:30.428
When Bowman saw Moody's ballistics
tests were inconclusive,

13:30.428 --> 13:32.931
he called for an examination of all
the evidence!

13:32.931 --> 13:37.202
It's just a matter of time before he
sees that you and Raul are innocent!

13:37.202 --> 13:39.638
Raul Casta, a widower, father
of one.

13:39.638 --> 13:42.374
(LAUGHS)
All right, you're not innocent,

13:42.374 --> 13:45.110
you committed a robbery,
but you didn't murder a priest.

13:45.110 --> 13:50.281
Jesus, remember I told you that
every barrel of a gun leaves
a unique mark on the bullet?

13:50.281 --> 13:53.818
Come. Moody says that the bullet
they took from Father Torelli

13:53.818 --> 13:57.555
matches the ones from your gun.
According to this test, they didn't!

13:57.555 --> 13:59.758
They lied?
So then Moody lied!

13:59.758 --> 14:02.927
He presented the test as if it were
conclusive

14:02.927 --> 14:05.964
and your attorney didn't contest it.

14:05.964 --> 14:08.967
Do you know what this means?
What?

14:08.967 --> 14:11.836
That Moody's evidence was
inconclusive.

14:11.836 --> 14:15.707
She's got a point there. They can't
fry somebody on that.

14:15.707 --> 14:18.610
He based your whole case on these
ballistics tests.

14:18.610 --> 14:22.480
And...And the witnesses that placed
you and Raul at the robbery,

14:22.480 --> 14:24.282
not the murder.

14:24.282 --> 14:27.786
And they got away with it?
Almost, almost.

14:27.786 --> 14:30.588
But he disregarded the Sixth
Amendment,

14:30.588 --> 14:32.857
he did not corroborate your DD-5,

14:32.857 --> 14:36.194
he intimidated your court-appointed
attorney...

14:36.194 --> 14:38.396
I've watched this guy manipulate
the law

14:38.396 --> 14:40.965
to become everything I've ever hated
about lawyers.

14:40.965 --> 14:44.102
Hold on a second, Sam.
If she's working for this Moody,

14:44.102 --> 14:46.771
what's she doing here helping you?

14:53.511 --> 14:56.081
Why are you helping me?

14:56.081 --> 14:59.951
Your letters. They made me aware
that I was allowing Moody

14:59.951 --> 15:02.587
to kill my people, who were ignorant
of the laws.

15:02.587 --> 15:05.123
You reminded me when my parents ran
away from Cuba.

15:05.123 --> 15:08.593
Yeah, but if Moody finds out what
you're doing here,

15:08.593 --> 15:12.163
he's gonna fire you.
I still have to live with myself.

15:13.198 --> 15:17.402
I'm not like Moody! I never knew
there were lawyers with morals.

15:17.402 --> 15:19.471
It's a pity that Moody breaks her.

15:21.806 --> 15:25.577
Jesus, you and Raul are innocent.
We are going to prove it. OK.

15:25.577 --> 15:29.080
Sam, I am gonna go check see how
Ziggy's coming with that interface.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.915
Maybe I can find something.

15:30.915 --> 15:33.451
Sam, I like her.

15:37.822 --> 15:39.824
What?

15:39.824 --> 15:42.594
You're different again.
I'm different? Yeah.

15:42.594 --> 15:46.665
The first time I met you in court,
you were very arrogant and angry

15:46.665 --> 15:49.100
and accused me of being a traitor
to our people.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.770
I'm sorry about that. I -
It's all right.

15:51.770 --> 15:57.876
When the trial ended, you changed.
Sitting on death row has an effect.

15:57.876 --> 16:00.111
Well, your letters changed.

16:00.111 --> 16:03.448
And when you wrote that appeal,

16:03.448 --> 16:07.619
I changed, Jesus.
I believed in something again.

16:14.326 --> 16:16.328
We have a lot of work to do.

16:16.328 --> 16:19.764
Listen, go back through everything,
make sure we didn't miss anything.

16:19.764 --> 16:22.867
And tell Raul we've got a chance.

16:22.867 --> 16:26.338
We've got a good chance!
I'm ready.

16:26.338 --> 16:27.806

Be careful.

16:37.282 --> 16:41.419
Jesus's research had taken him into
every case that was overturned
on a technicality.

16:41.419 --> 16:48.259
On the one hand, it felt strange to
be doing exactly what Tearsa
had accused Moody of -

16:48.259 --> 16:50.562
manipulating the fine points of the
law.

16:51.262 --> 16:55.200

What did she say?
She says we have to...

17:08.980 --> 17:12.851
go over the whole thing all over
again, OK?

17:12.851 --> 17:16.788
In case we missed anything, we should
go over everything again. Why?

17:16.788 --> 17:20.025
Because I wanna see it like Moody
would see it.

17:21.526 --> 17:24.561
My er...Rosita was sick.

17:27.265 --> 17:30.735
The fever was so high that I knew
she was gonna die.

17:33.538 --> 17:37.375
It was crazy. No wife, a sick kid.

17:38.910 --> 17:41.179
I went over to your apartment
about seven

17:41.179 --> 17:43.315
to ask for money.

17:43.315 --> 17:46.551
We er...we talked for a long time

17:46.551 --> 17:48.653
and then we decided to go to church.

17:51.389 --> 17:54.893
We said that after all the money
we gave in collections,

17:54.893 --> 17:57.729
maybe for once the Madonna could
give it back us.

18:00.065 --> 18:03.635
But the Madonna, she did not help.

18:05.303 --> 18:08.606
What about the priest?
The priest?

18:10.175 --> 18:12.410
He was sorry.

18:12.410 --> 18:16.147
He said he was sorry my nino was
sick,

18:16.147 --> 18:19.951
but there was no money for medicine.
What about the money for the poor?

18:19.951 --> 18:23.621
He said we were gonna use the money
for rum.

18:26.124 --> 18:28.827
Then what happened?
I went crazy!

18:31.596 --> 18:33.999
I told him his vestments were a lie

18:33.999 --> 18:36.434
and that he was not a man of God,

18:36.434 --> 18:40.772
because God would help a sick child!

18:44.342 --> 18:48.647
Then the...the sisters heard my
scream and they came out...

18:50.949 --> 18:52.951
..and you pulled me back
to the chapel.

18:52.951 --> 18:55.587
You said Torelli was no padre,

18:55.587 --> 18:57.689
that this wasn't a house of God.

18:59.658 --> 19:03.895
And with your bare hands, you broke
the lock on the poor box

19:03.895 --> 19:06.364
and we took the money.

Raul, we're not gonna die.

19:29.621 --> 19:33.591
What time did we leave the church?
About a quarter to eight.

19:34.793 --> 19:38.897
I remember because I knew we had
enough time to get to the pharmacy,

19:38.897 --> 19:40.165
to get to Julio.

19:40.165 --> 19:43.335
Julio... Antuna.

19:43.335 --> 19:46.271
Yeah. He was a doctor in Cuba.

19:48.139 --> 19:50.375
He couldn't get his licence
when he came over,

19:50.375 --> 19:54.446
so he swept the floors in the
pharmacy. He stole the medicine

19:54.446 --> 19:56.614
for my Rosita

19:56.614 --> 19:59.985
when he saw I didn't have enough
money.

19:59.985 --> 20:04.689
That's...That's why I thought maybe
he didn't come to the trial.

20:06.725 --> 20:10.395
I swear to you, Jesus, I was with
them when the priest got murdered,

20:10.395 --> 20:12.664

I need to make a phone call. It's
after hours. You know the rules.

I don't have hours. I'm gonna be dead

This makes no sense.
'What doesn't?'

21:01.680 --> 21:06.151
Julio Antuna moved out of the area
two days after the murder.
Something is not right.

21:06.151 --> 21:10.555
Raul thinks that it's because Julio
stole medicine for Raul's daughter.

21:10.555 --> 21:12.657
According to the police records,

21:12.657 --> 21:16.494
two officers went to see him right
after Father Torelli died.

21:16.494 --> 21:20.031
But the report they filed is
missing. The next day, Mr Antuna
disappeared.

21:20.031 --> 21:22.133
She found out more than we did!

21:22.133 --> 21:24.769
Julio Antuna never registered
in the United States.

21:24.769 --> 21:28.139
We searched the whole country
and he never went as Julio Antuna.

21:28.139 --> 21:32.444
This is crazy. The ballistics test
was inconclusive.

21:32.444 --> 21:36.715
There was a discrepancy between the
time witnesses put Raul and I
at the church,

21:36.715 --> 21:41.419
plus the only friendly witness
vanished 48 hours after the crime!

21:41.419 --> 21:44.055
We can get him, Jesus.
Look, I better get out of here.

21:44.055 --> 21:46.358
Why, where are you?
In Moody's office.

21:46.358 --> 21:48.159
Moody's office? Get out of there!

21:48.159 --> 21:50.161
Go, Al! I'm on it.

in his office.

as I'm not on the phone with you.

22:33.772 --> 22:36.141
This is a happy group.
What did you find out?

22:38.810 --> 22:42.013
I found out that someone from this
office

22:42.013 --> 22:43.948
has been working with Ortega.

22:43.948 --> 22:45.817
Stay cool. He doesn't know it's you
yet.

22:45.817 --> 22:49.354
Whoever it is, he's given
the Governor enough information

22:49.354 --> 22:53.325
to force a stay of execution, maybe
even overturn the conviction.

22:53.325 --> 22:55.160
Bowman has subpoenaed our records.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.762
And he's talking seriously about
re-opening the trial.

22:57.762 --> 23:01.533
Good!
How did he find out?

23:01.533 --> 23:04.736
Come on! He's not gonna say who
the Judas is!

23:04.736 --> 23:07.405
Careful. Maybe it's not someone
in the office.

23:07.405 --> 23:10.742
Maybe it's someone -
It's internal. They know too much.

23:10.742 --> 23:12.711
But not everything.

23:15.981 --> 23:18.016
That sounds like the lawyers I know.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.357
I want everyone in this office
checked.

23:26.858 --> 23:28.259
Everyone!

Do whatever it takes. I wouldn't
worry about Ortega and Casta.

I'm not, Herb.

23:43.054 --> 23:45.056
If the can't introduce any new
evidence,

23:45.056 --> 23:48.726
they'll reschedule the execution
for tomorrow and it'll be over.

Judas. Now do it!

not one of them.

They've rescheduled the execution
for tomorrow morning.

24:18.564 --> 24:20.599
Is there a time?

24:20.599 --> 24:24.303
7am. There's gotta be something
we're missing.

24:24.303 --> 24:26.539
She's checked out everything, Sam.

I've hired an investigative team
to find Julio. With her own money.

24:30.943 --> 24:34.813
But I need more time.
We need a stay from the Governor.

24:34.813 --> 24:38.984
What about Bowman? He's not gonna
push for an extension

24:38.984 --> 24:42.154
unless we find some real hard
evidence.

24:52.598 --> 24:55.835
What's a through-and-through?

24:55.835 --> 24:58.404
That's a police term to describe
a shooting.

24:58.404 --> 25:03.142
It's when a bullet completely passes
through the body cavity
and comes out the other side.

25:03.142 --> 25:05.645
According to the coroner's report,

25:06.846 --> 25:09.849
Father Torelli was killed by multiple
gunshot wounds,

25:09.849 --> 25:12.118
one of which they found lodged
in the sternum

25:12.118 --> 25:16.055
and another one which passed through
the lung,

25:16.055 --> 25:19.258
ripping through the left ventricle
before it left the body.

25:19.258 --> 25:21.360
So where's the second bullet?

25:21.360 --> 25:24.163
Yeah. So what happened to the second
bullet?

25:24.163 --> 25:26.932
We never found it. Forensics
searched for two days.

25:26.932 --> 25:30.803
Maybe modern technology has a way of
finding it now. Nice shot.

25:30.803 --> 25:34.173
They searched all the walls,
the heating grates, the curtains.

25:34.173 --> 25:36.609
They even pulled down statues.
if I can get Ziggy

25:36.609 --> 25:38.778
to modify the sensors
on the handling,

25:38.778 --> 25:41.447
they can work it as a kind of metal
detector.

25:41.447 --> 25:45.952
I need you to check again.
It has been almost two years, OK?

25:47.620 --> 25:49.722
If I can centre on her brainwaves,

25:49.722 --> 25:53.092
that'll give Ziggy a clear sensory
base to pull from,

25:53.092 --> 25:54.994
but I gotta have her ideas.

25:54.994 --> 25:56.862
If we can find that bullet in one
piece,

25:56.862 --> 26:00.666
we can prove that it wasn't my gun
that killed the priest!
Get her there!

26:00.666 --> 26:04.637
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes, but that bullet can't still be
in that church!

26:04.637 --> 26:06.806
What else do we have?

26:06.806 --> 26:10.209
I dunno, but we can spend time -
What? We can't find Julio.

26:10.209 --> 26:13.346
You can't alter the statements of
a dead priest or the witnesses.

26:13.346 --> 26:15.648
The bullet is our only hope!

26:15.648 --> 26:18.050
OK. OK!

26:18.050 --> 26:20.920
All right. What do you want me to
do? Just look?

26:20.920 --> 26:23.089
Um... No.

26:23.089 --> 26:26.459
No, no. You gotta do more.

26:26.459 --> 26:30.029
I think you have to re-enact
the shooting. This is crazy!

26:30.029 --> 26:33.766
No, it's not! I came across some
transcripts from the court files.

26:33.766 --> 26:38.504
There was this testimony from this
expert witness, this Dr Michaels guy.

26:38.504 --> 26:41.240
He gave his report based on where
the body was found.

26:41.240 --> 26:45.778
Based on Torelli's physical position
at the time of the shooting,

26:45.778 --> 26:49.382
you could pinpoint exactly where
the bullet came out! OK. Listen.

26:49.382 --> 26:51.350
We've done that.
Do it again, then!

26:51.350 --> 26:55.588
It's all right here!
OK, OK... All right. I'll do it.

27:01.727 --> 27:05.264
It's right here, see?
Wait. You gotta have this!

27:05.264 --> 27:07.066
OK? All right. I'll call you.

to do this detecting, but...

28:00.586 --> 28:04.657

all alone?

28:04.657 --> 28:09.295
That's OK. We know that the priest
was killed up here by the altar,

the bullet! Could help.

30:40.579 --> 30:42.548
She never acts like this.

30:42.548 --> 30:46.719
Listen to me closely. Tell her
it's behind the frame.

30:46.719 --> 30:50.323
It's behind the frame. The bullet.
The bullet.

30:50.323 --> 30:52.758
She's seen too much TV.
Senora, wait.

30:52.758 --> 30:55.761
I was praying to the Madonna
to help me find the bullet.

30:55.761 --> 30:58.531
I think she's letting me know
through this child's words.

30:58.531 --> 31:03.469
A miracle? I think so.
Is the angel still here? Oh, yeah.

31:03.469 --> 31:07.540
Can he tell you where the bullet is?
The lower left-hand corner.

31:07.540 --> 31:10.843
The lower left-hand corner.
The picture of the Madonna.

31:10.843 --> 31:12.912
The picture of the Madonna.

31:14.213 --> 31:19.085
Thank you! Thanks, honey. You've got
an angel that owes you one.

31:39.171 --> 31:41.907
Es un milagro!

31:41.907 --> 31:43.809
(BELLS RING)

31:49.248 --> 31:52.184
You're out of here, son.
You're out of here!

31:52.184 --> 31:54.520
Ha ha ha!
You found the bullet?

31:54.520 --> 31:57.823
Yes! It was right there in the wall.

31:57.823 --> 32:00.559
Do you wanna know why they couldn't
find it?

32:00.559 --> 32:04.430
Do you know? No.
Let me...

32:04.430 --> 32:08.334
The bullet went right through
the priest, into the wall,

32:08.334 --> 32:12.004
and when it did, it hit right on the
corner of this picture frame

32:12.004 --> 32:14.040
that moved the frame a little bit,

32:14.040 --> 32:16.409
and then gravity swung it back
over the hole.

32:16.409 --> 32:18.577
So when the police looked at it,

32:18.577 --> 32:22.448
they looked for a bullet hole,
but they never checked behind it.

32:22.448 --> 32:24.317
Well, that's great.

32:24.317 --> 32:27.453
Now we just wait for Tearsa to take
the bullet to Ballistics,

32:27.453 --> 32:31.290
they check it against Jesus's gun,
it doesn't match,

32:31.290 --> 32:33.492
so that proves that you and Raul
are innocent,

32:33.492 --> 32:35.995
and whoopy-dong, you're history!

32:35.995 --> 32:40.299
And then Moody is forced to reopen
the case. Absolute-a-roony!

32:40.299 --> 32:42.501
So why am I still here?

32:42.501 --> 32:44.403
If Tearsa found the bullet
and it's OK,

32:44.403 --> 32:47.139
shouldn't I be leaving about now?
You got a point.

32:47.139 --> 32:51.611
Maybe it's because I'm being given
a chance to say goodbye to Tearsa,

32:51.611 --> 32:54.180
something like that?
Beep beep beep...

32:54.180 --> 32:55.548
Right?

32:57.516 --> 33:00.853
What?
Well, um...

33:00.853 --> 33:04.457
What?
Erm...

33:06.659 --> 33:11.430
It's just that the ballistic report

33:11.430 --> 33:15.534
says that the bullet Tearsa found
came from Jesus's gun...

33:18.638 --> 33:22.675
and proves conclusively that
you murdered Father Torelli

33:22.675 --> 33:24.944
and you're guilty, Sam.

33:24.944 --> 33:28.047
And Ziggy says you're...

33:28.047 --> 33:30.816
gonna die in the chair in three
hours and 17 minutes.

33:38.298 --> 33:41.335
You lied to me! Look at me!

33:41.335 --> 33:43.403
You look at me!

33:47.474 --> 33:50.511
I'm sorry. 
Sorry? For what?

33:50.511 --> 33:53.080
For using me? Letting me think that
you were innocent

33:53.080 --> 33:54.815
when you murdered a priest?

33:54.815 --> 33:57.818
I believe Jesus Ortega was innocent!

33:57.818 --> 33:59.987
No matter what crime he committed,

33:59.987 --> 34:03.090
I'm here because something isn't
right. What are you on about?

34:03.090 --> 34:06.560
I don't belong here. I'm not the man
who killed that priest.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.630
Oh, no (!) I'm not the man who wrote
you those letters

34:09.630 --> 34:12.833
or wrote that brief.
I'm not that man! Then who are you?

34:15.502 --> 34:19.672
If I told you, if I tried to explain,
you would never believe me.

34:19.672 --> 34:22.442
No. You try and explain it to me!

34:22.442 --> 34:25.545
Explain to me what you were doing
when you were preaching to me

34:25.545 --> 34:30.184
about my dignity, about my
responsibility to all those Cubans

34:30.184 --> 34:32.686
that were repressed by the American
system!

34:33.520 --> 34:35.489
You used me!

34:35.489 --> 34:37.791
I never used you!

34:37.791 --> 34:40.027
I never lied to you!

34:40.027 --> 34:41.862
I never lied to you!
(BUZZER)

Well...

34:49.969 --> 34:52.438
Well, well...

34:52.438 --> 34:55.108
It's so nice to catch the two of you
together...

34:57.043 --> 34:59.713
Let it go, Theo. It's over.

34:59.713 --> 35:04.618
Over? For him it's over.
For you, it's just beginning.

35:06.019 --> 35:09.022
For you I have a special punishment
to fit your disloyalty.

35:10.557 --> 35:12.726
It's hard to be loyal to the devil.

35:12.726 --> 35:16.964
Whatever happened to how much
you admired me?

35:16.964 --> 35:19.666
How much you hoped your career
would mirror mine?

35:19.666 --> 35:23.036
I didn't know you then,
and what you were capable of.

35:23.036 --> 35:25.672
Convicting murderers.
I thought they were innocent!

35:27.241 --> 35:31.411
They weren't.
You have to pay for that, Tearsa.

35:31.411 --> 35:34.081
You don't have to destroy her.
She's a traitor.

35:34.081 --> 35:36.550
Because of her, you have
your conclusive evidence

35:36.550 --> 35:39.153
and Raul and I will be dead in an
hour. Isn't that enough?

35:40.754 --> 35:42.990
No. What is it with you?

35:42.990 --> 35:45.292
You won't be happy till everyone here
is dead?

35:45.292 --> 35:48.395
Your impending death has made you
a very brave man.

35:48.395 --> 35:51.665
I don't wanna see Tearsa's life
ruined. You won't. You'll be dead.

35:51.665 --> 35:55.636
You are so cruel.
I'm cruel? What about you?

35:55.636 --> 35:58.272
I trusted you!

35:58.272 --> 36:01.475
I gave you my confidence.
I taught you the jewels of law

36:01.475 --> 36:04.144
and you betrayed me.
How many people have YOU betrayed?

36:04.144 --> 36:08.348
You put the five men on death watch
by pushing their cases through court.

36:08.348 --> 36:11.618
Five convicted criminals.
Who might be innocent!

36:11.618 --> 36:15.155
You weren't - Guilty. Innocent. This
is not about guilt or innocence.

36:15.155 --> 36:18.292
You're using their bodies to get to
the Governor's mansion!

36:18.292 --> 36:20.127
Whatever it takes.

36:20.806 --> 36:23.642
Well, I'm gonna make sure everybody
knows what you are!

36:23.642 --> 36:28.647
I don't think so.
I think that you will slither away

36:28.647 --> 36:32.818
with your tail between your legs
because I'm having you disbarred,

36:32.818 --> 36:36.755
for misappropriating information
from my personal files

36:36.755 --> 36:40.092
and using it to aid and abet
a convicted murderer.

36:40.092 --> 36:43.762
What?
You made the ultimate mistake.

36:45.998 --> 36:48.066

36:49.801 --> 36:53.539
You've lost. And you are a dead man.

36:55.607 --> 36:58.510
Listen to me. You haven't lost.

36:58.510 --> 37:01.446
Yes, I have. You made sure of that.

37:14.059 --> 37:18.130
Are you going to...dance
before your execution, Jesus?

37:21.500 --> 37:23.602
Oh!

37:23.602 --> 37:25.671
It's an old prison saying.

37:27.072 --> 37:30.209
To the man on his final walk
to the chair,

37:31.577 --> 37:34.613
the stench of fear chokes him
and he panics,

37:36.482 --> 37:40.819
struggling in the arms of his captor
for one moment of freedom.

37:42.454 --> 37:44.490
Some people say it looks like
a dance,

37:45.424 --> 37:47.226
the last dance before death.

37:50.896 --> 37:52.931
A little manic, don't you think?

38:09.715 --> 38:12.351
Would you like to make a confession,
Jesus?

38:14.253 --> 38:15.988
Would you like to make a confession?

38:18.790 --> 38:21.026
I don't have anything to confess.

38:21.026 --> 38:25.297
God has not forsaken you.
I know that.

38:25.297 --> 38:27.332
But you don't believe it.

38:30.068 --> 38:33.539
You're wondering,
'Has my god abandoned me?'

38:33.539 --> 38:36.308
I can see it in your eyes, Jesus.

38:36.308 --> 38:39.211
Is that what you're thinking?
No.

38:39.211 --> 38:42.214
Sometimes when I pray,

38:42.214 --> 38:45.117
I have the feeling that maybe God
is too busy

38:45.117 --> 38:47.786
to hear the prayers of a priest.
Busy?

38:47.786 --> 38:52.157
Because I'm his servant, a soldier
who works in his name

38:52.157 --> 38:55.260
to make right hat the times
have made wrong.

38:57.196 --> 39:01.767
He...He wouldn't be too busy.

39:03.669 --> 39:07.473
Sometimes the good are the last
to be heard.

39:07.473 --> 39:11.376
But you are like the Prodigal Son.
God...

39:11.376 --> 39:14.279
God is not going to leave me here.

39:14.279 --> 39:16.882
He's calling you home, Jesus.

39:16.882 --> 39:20.219
Look, I haven't done anything wrong.

39:20.219 --> 39:22.354
That's what you don't understand.

39:22.354 --> 39:24.990
I've done everything that has been
asked of me.

39:27.092 --> 39:31.296

die in that chair.

39:37.202 --> 39:39.238
What happens in that room...

39:39.238 --> 39:41.807
is not important, Jesus.

leave this world.

blasphemous things about the priest!

killed the priest, didn't you?

of Father Torelli.

42:26.505 --> 42:27.940
You were here to save Raul.

42:29.842 --> 42:32.978
I want to admit in front of all of

42:32.978 --> 42:35.481
that I left Raul Casta

42:35.481 --> 42:37.716
after we robbed the poor box...

42:37.716 --> 42:42.788
Then you went to get your gun.
I went back to get my gun...

42:42.788 --> 42:45.057
and murdered the priest.

42:45.057 --> 42:47.726
Raul is part of the reason
you're here.

The other reason is to take down
Theodore Moody!

42:50.996 --> 42:53.699
There's one more thing...
Moody bribed Raul's witness

42:53.699 --> 42:55.667
to leave the state of Florida.

42:57.569 --> 43:01.306
I know that the District Attorney
bribed a witness to leave the state,

43:01.306 --> 43:05.177
a witness whose evidence could have
proven that Raul was innocent.

43:05.177 --> 43:09.047
And tell them that Julio Antuna,
the morning after the shooting,

43:09.047 --> 43:11.817
left to visit his daughter
in New York.

43:11.817 --> 43:15.454
And Julio Antuna left Tallahassee
the morning after the shooting

43:15.454 --> 43:17.656
to visit his daughter in New York.

43:17.656 --> 43:20.592
When he returned...
He was questioned by the police...

This is ridiculous.

And then Dr Antuna, who had lost his
medical status when he fled Cuba
to come to the USA,

43:33.806 --> 43:38.243
was given a chance to obtain his
medical licence in New York State

43:38.243 --> 43:41.380
on the condition that he leave
Florida and never return.

He says he was given the opportunity
to be a doctor by Theodore Moody

44:28.393 --> 44:31.964
and all he had to do was give
a statement to the DA's office

44:31.964 --> 44:34.700
to prove Raul Casta's innocence,

44:34.700 --> 44:37.636
which he's willing to do again,
and you can quote me on that.

remaining cases on death row

44:53.719 --> 44:56.054
and gets two overturned
for lack of evidence.

44:56.054 --> 44:58.824
She turns out to be a hell of
a good... What are you doing?

44:58.824 --> 45:01.927
Time to go home, eh, Al?
You better leap! What are you doing?

45:01.927 --> 45:03.996
I hope Al is the name of
your guardian angel.

45:03.996 --> 45:07.065
No, no. You gotta leap, Sam!

45:07.065 --> 45:08.734
Come on! Leap! Leap!

45:08.734 --> 45:11.336
Hey, leap, Sam! Leap now!
Come on, leap!

45:11.336 --> 45:14.940
Leap!
Don't touch that thing! Sam, leap!

45:14.940 --> 45:17.743
Leap now! Leap, Sam! Leap!

45:24.817 --> 45:27.319
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

45:32.558 --> 45:34.893
What are you doing? Challenge me!

45:38.030 --> 45:40.098
Come on!

45:46.371 --> 45:48.373
Prepare to die, Russkie!

45:52.411 --> 45:55.380
Urrrgh!
