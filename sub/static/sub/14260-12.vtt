Whoa, dudette, that is

for your Aunt Agatha
to me.

02:51.437 --> 02:52.637
This is Dr. Webb,

of Dynamitic Labs.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.141

back with us to our lair?

04:02.309 --> 04:03.675
Leonardo's right.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.544
The thief couldn't possibly
know our secret location.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.413
All right. But remember,

04:08.415 --> 04:10.715
it mustn't fall
into the thief's hands.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.183

08:48.527 --> 08:50.527
Okay,
here goes.

08:52.764 --> 08:54.665
[all talking at once]

08:56.101 --> 08:57.402
Miss Agatha?

08:57.404 --> 08:59.303
Whoo, good gracious!

08:59.305 --> 09:00.638
Where am I?

09:00.640 --> 09:03.107
Well, you're
in our lair.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.175
[chuckling]
And it certainly
is an honor.

09:05.177 --> 09:07.144
Lair? What lair?

09:07.146 --> 09:08.646
Uh, how did I get here?

09:08.648 --> 09:10.948
Uh, something
must have gone wrong

09:10.950 --> 09:12.916
with the oscillator
relay control.

09:12.918 --> 09:15.753
See, instead
of pulling us
into the TV,

09:15.755 --> 09:18.089
[chuckling]
it pulled you
out of it.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.024
Oh, now
I remember you.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.126
You're my niece
April's friends,

09:22.128 --> 09:25.096
the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Tortoises.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.432
Uh, close enough.

09:29.568 --> 09:32.003
[Knuckles]
Uh, what's goin' on?

09:32.005 --> 09:34.772
That was no ordinary
power surge.

09:34.774 --> 09:38.843
Someone is trying to lock in
on the molecularizer beam,

09:38.845 --> 09:40.612
and the source
of it is...

09:40.614 --> 09:42.212
[beeping]
somewhere
in the sewer system,

09:42.214 --> 09:43.814
right about here.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.150
I want you two
to find out who's
snooping around...

09:46.152 --> 09:47.485
and eliminate them.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.120
Uh, right, Professor.

09:50.789 --> 09:51.923
[Donatello]
So you see,

09:51.925 --> 09:53.257
whoever stole
those parts

09:53.259 --> 09:55.560
is probably building
a Doomsday Device

09:55.562 --> 09:56.627
right now!

09:56.629 --> 09:57.962
Good heavens!

09:57.964 --> 09:59.397
We sure could
use your help

09:59.399 --> 10:01.232
in tracking down
the guilty party, ma'am.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.934
Well, I'd be delighted
to lend my services.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.571
Miss Agatha
at your service.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.105
[chattering]

10:09.274 --> 10:10.841
Uh, first could
you tell us

10:10.843 --> 10:12.109
who the guilty
party was

10:12.111 --> 10:13.844
in the "Case
of the Missing Guppy?"

10:13.846 --> 10:15.780
We bet a pizza on it.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.248
Oh, that'll have
to wait, lads.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.083
We've got to get
down to sleuthing.

10:19.085 --> 10:21.819
Now, I'll need
an assistant.

10:21.821 --> 10:24.221
Hmm...I choose...

10:24.223 --> 10:25.455
you, Raphael.

10:25.457 --> 10:28.092
No fair!
What about us?

10:28.094 --> 10:30.260
Oh, you'll all get
your turn to help.

10:30.262 --> 10:32.296
Right now, I only
need one of you.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.931
But why Raphael?

10:33.933 --> 10:37.301
Red has always been
my favorite color.

10:38.737 --> 10:40.971
[Raphael]
Why are we going
to the library?

10:40.973 --> 10:43.740
Shouldn't we be
zooming around town
in the Turtle Van?

10:43.742 --> 10:47.678
I prefer a more
scholarly approach.

10:49.180 --> 10:51.648
Hey, Knuckles,
do you know
who that is?

10:51.650 --> 10:54.485
Uh, some bozo
in a turtle costume.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.353
No, the other one.

10:56.355 --> 10:59.089
Hey, it's Miss Agatha,
the TV detective.

10:59.091 --> 11:00.758
Oh, she's my favorite.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.026
Hey, let's follow them.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.328
I'd love to get
her autograph.

11:06.365 --> 11:07.531
Ah, here it is,

11:07.533 --> 11:09.067
the science section.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.836
Our villain
is obviously someone

11:11.838 --> 11:14.672
with a vast knowledge
of molecular science.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.742
Aha, Professor
Vilmont Von Volt,

11:17.744 --> 11:19.543
winner of the
Science Bowl Award

11:19.545 --> 11:21.946
for advanced
molecular studies.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.949
We may have just
found our man.

11:24.951 --> 11:27.952
Uh-oh, she's
after the boss.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.721
Oh, boy, is he in trouble.

11:30.723 --> 11:33.323
I must see
my niece April
immediately.

11:33.325 --> 11:36.260
Uh, is a family visit
really necessary?

11:36.262 --> 11:38.362
You said we were
in a hurry!

11:38.364 --> 11:41.499
[Agatha]
Aha, I found
the scoundrel.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.600
It seems when
Professor Von Volt

11:43.602 --> 11:46.536
was drummed out of science
for his harebrained theories,

11:46.538 --> 11:48.839
he vowed to take
revenge on the world.

11:48.841 --> 11:51.808
I just knew my computer files
on the weird and famous

11:51.810 --> 11:53.110
would contain a clue.

11:53.112 --> 11:56.080
Motive plus ability
equals culprit.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.349
Von Volt
is definitely our man.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.417
There you go.
Is it any wonder

12:00.419 --> 12:02.152
she's got her own
prime-time show?

12:02.154 --> 12:04.155
Aunt Aggie,
you're wonderful!

12:04.157 --> 12:05.489
I don't know
how you do it.

12:05.491 --> 12:08.425
Brilliance runs
in our family, dear.

12:09.561 --> 12:11.295
Where to now?

12:11.297 --> 12:13.230
Observe and absorb.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.899
I gotcha!

12:16.769 --> 12:19.069
Now it's your turn,
turtle.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.138
Guess again,
Blister Brain.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.176
Hey!

12:25.178 --> 12:26.277
You're next.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.112
Oh, yeah?

12:28.114 --> 12:30.214
Goodness gracious!

12:30.216 --> 12:31.181
Oh, no!

12:34.486 --> 12:35.419
[horn honking]

12:36.688 --> 12:39.223
Let's
get out of here!

12:39.225 --> 12:40.991
I'll have you out
in a minute.

12:42.494 --> 12:45.762
Boy, the city streets
are becoming so dangerous!

12:45.764 --> 12:49.167
Now to see what I grabbed
from that bully's lapel.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.068
Oh? What have we here?

12:51.070 --> 12:54.372
It appears to be
a white cat hair.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.708
And a small glob
of some strange
substance.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.244
Hurry. We must
examine these clues

13:00.246 --> 13:02.379
under Donatello's
microscope.
[tires squealing]

13:02.381 --> 13:04.181
[gasping]
Miss Agatha!

13:04.183 --> 13:06.550
Look out! No!

13:06.552 --> 13:08.052
Aah!

13:10.355 --> 13:12.356
Aah!

13:18.664 --> 13:20.631
[panting]
She's gone!

13:20.633 --> 13:22.666
Miss Agatha,
where are you?

13:22.668 --> 13:24.869
Yoo-hoo!
I'm right here,
Raphael!

13:24.871 --> 13:26.103
Oh, thank goodness

13:26.105 --> 13:28.539
for these new
lightweight
manhole covers.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.342
Oh, I thought
that van did you in.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.311
Piffle. That could
never happen.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.112
I'm the guest star.

13:35.114 --> 13:36.214
[chuckling]
Yeah, well,

13:36.216 --> 13:37.448
it all happened so fast,

13:37.450 --> 13:38.816
I never got
the license number.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.384
It's not necessary.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.787
I managed to mark
the underside of the van

13:42.789 --> 13:44.288
with this.
Lipstick?

13:44.290 --> 13:47.158
A lady never leaves home
without it.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.461
[Agatha]
Hmm, most interesting.

13:51.463 --> 13:54.899
The guilty party owns
a white Persian cat,

13:54.901 --> 13:58.802
a breed found only
in a small village
in Afghanistan.

13:58.804 --> 14:02.073
Wow, East Afghanistan
or West Afghanistan?

14:02.075 --> 14:03.908
Central Afghanistan.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.843
Whoa, is she awesome
or what?

14:06.845 --> 14:10.347
Now, the microspores
indicate that it's being fed

14:10.349 --> 14:12.583
large quantities
of caviar.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.452
rare Slobovian
caviar.

14:15.454 --> 14:17.021
Raphael and I
will check out

14:17.023 --> 14:19.323
some exclusive
gourmet shops for leads.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.591
You two get to have
all the fun.

14:21.593 --> 14:23.561
We want to play
detective, too.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.996
Isn't there some way
we can help, Miss Agatha?

14:25.998 --> 14:27.398
Oh, by all means.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.100
I've marked the underside
of the villain's blue van

14:30.102 --> 14:31.301
with lipstick.

14:31.303 --> 14:32.770
Now, you find
my initials,

14:32.772 --> 14:34.972
and you have
your criminal.

14:37.275 --> 14:39.043
Leonardo, how are
you guys doing?

14:39.045 --> 14:42.012
<i>Lousy. No sign</i>
<i>of that blue van yet.</i>

14:42.014 --> 14:44.181
Yeah, I know
just how you feel.

14:44.183 --> 14:46.350
Miss Agatha and I
are striking out, too.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.419
Perhaps not. Look.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.221
A gourmet food shop.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.356
And they're having a sale
on Slobovian caviar.

14:53.358 --> 14:56.160
And look who's coming
out of the place.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.528
[Raphael]
There's the same creeps
who jumped us before.

14:58.530 --> 15:00.297
[Agatha]
And they're getting into--

15:00.299 --> 15:02.466
[both]
A blue van!

15:02.468 --> 15:04.668
Later, guy. I think
we just hit the jackpot.

15:04.670 --> 15:07.171
Oh, fiddlesticks,
they're getting away.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.472
[Raphael]
We still have
a chance.

15:08.474 --> 15:09.506
Hey kid,
how you doing?

15:09.508 --> 15:11.709
Listen, I have to borrow
that skateboard, okay?

15:11.711 --> 15:13.176
No way, man!

15:13.178 --> 15:15.279
Nobody touches
my wheels!

15:15.281 --> 15:17.647
Yeah, yeah, I know,
but I'm Raphael,

15:17.649 --> 15:20.017
one of the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles!

15:20.019 --> 15:21.152
Big deal.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.421
Oh, won't you
reconsider, young man?

15:23.423 --> 15:25.622
It's in the name
of truth and justice.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.558
Hey, I recognize you!

15:28.560 --> 15:31.695
You're Miss Agatha
from TV! Wow!

15:31.697 --> 15:33.564
If you need it,
it's yours!

15:33.566 --> 15:35.332
Well, thanks a lot.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.668
Now to follow
those guys before
we lose their trail.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.436
Not without me,
you won't.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.973
Well, if you insist.
Hang on!

15:44.075 --> 15:45.575
Are you okay?

15:45.577 --> 15:47.578
Oh, don't worry
about me!

15:47.580 --> 15:49.346
Shred it to the max!

15:49.348 --> 15:50.481
[Agatha]
There it is!

15:50.483 --> 15:52.182
[Raphael]
And they're going
into that factory.

15:52.184 --> 15:54.050
Then so are we.

15:55.187 --> 15:57.020
Okay, let's
get 'em!
Wait.

16:01.859 --> 16:03.327
[zapping]

16:03.329 --> 16:05.729
How did you know
the fence was
electrified?

16:05.731 --> 16:07.598
Elementary,
my dear Raphael.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.066
Our genius I.Q. villain

16:09.068 --> 16:11.769
would hardly overlook
such obvious protection.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.471
Well, I guess we'll just have
to find some other way in.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.605
Hmm...

16:19.077 --> 16:21.445
I think I have it.

16:21.447 --> 16:23.514
Here goes.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.849
[grunting]
Okay, your turn.

16:28.486 --> 16:29.820
Whoo!

16:29.822 --> 16:32.756
Now, let's get
this Von Volt person.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.730
[alarm]
Uh-oh, we got
intruders.

16:40.732 --> 16:43.133
Uh, it's that lady
shamus again.

16:43.135 --> 16:46.036
Just when I've
almost finished
my Doomsday Device.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.405
Unleash
the destroyer robot.

16:48.407 --> 16:50.073
[Knuckles]
Uh, right, Professor.

16:50.075 --> 16:52.343
[buzzing]

16:59.517 --> 17:01.185
Heavens to Betsy!

17:02.720 --> 17:04.421
Remind me to rent
one of these things

17:04.423 --> 17:05.756
for our next barbeque.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.691
[TurtleCom beeping]
Emergency, guys.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.461
Get to 400
Commerce Street now!

17:11.896 --> 17:13.097
Oh, gee, I hope

17:13.098 --> 17:14.263
they received
that last transmission.

17:16.067 --> 17:18.035
[Raphael]
Talk about timing!

17:18.037 --> 17:20.738
[all]
Turtle power!

17:20.740 --> 17:22.606
[Knuckles]
More shellbacks?

17:22.608 --> 17:24.875
That robot will
take care of them also.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.645
Is this someone's idea
of a warm welcome?

17:27.646 --> 17:29.513
Knock out
its camera eye,

17:29.515 --> 17:31.482
and it won't be
able to see us.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.418
As always,
you're one step
ahead of everyone.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.788
[Garth]
These turtles are good.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.124
[Von Volt]
Nonsense.
I love a challenge.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.760
Wait 'til they meet
the octo-creature.
Ha ha ha ha!

17:42.762 --> 17:44.327
Good work, Raphael.

17:44.329 --> 17:46.764
Looks like you didn't
need our help after all.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.132
[rumbling]

17:49.134 --> 17:51.402
[Michelangelo]
What is that?

17:51.404 --> 17:54.171
[Donatello]
Some sort of a computer
controlled creature.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.240
Look, you boys distract it

17:56.242 --> 17:58.742
while Raphael and I
infiltrate the factory.

18:02.113 --> 18:04.214
We must get inside.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.515
I hope
you've got a hairpin.

18:05.517 --> 18:08.218
Actually, I was thinking
of something larger.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.359
Ta-da!

18:15.361 --> 18:16.493
No, no, let me guess.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.495
You were a pole-vault
gold medallist

18:18.497 --> 18:20.564
in the 1952 Olympics, right?

18:20.566 --> 18:22.366
1956.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.911
Well, I guess this is
the end of the line, huh?

18:33.913 --> 18:35.746
It certainly is
for Von Volt.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.348
You might as well
turn yourself in,
Professor.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.717
Ha! You must be joking.

18:40.719 --> 18:42.252
Knuckles, Garth!

18:42.254 --> 18:44.755
Take care
of our uninvited
guests.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.557
Uh, right,
Professor.
[button beeps]

18:46.559 --> 18:48.057
Whoa, whoa!

18:48.059 --> 18:51.162
Yeah, that's it!
Get down!

18:51.164 --> 18:53.163
Uh, like they say
in French,

18:53.165 --> 18:54.365
on your guard!

18:54.367 --> 18:56.133
It's <i> en garde.</i>

18:56.135 --> 18:57.434
Who cares?

18:57.436 --> 18:58.936
Let's just
start dueling.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.004
Ugh!

19:01.906 --> 19:04.007
[all yelling]
Watch out!

19:04.009 --> 19:07.344
Oh, I got to remember this
for my next nightmare!

19:11.682 --> 19:14.150
Guys,
call me Mr. Gloomy,

19:14.152 --> 19:16.954
but I think we're
in serious trouble.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.723
You should have stuck
to your knitting, lady.

19:19.725 --> 19:23.060
And you to learning
to handle a laser sword.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.160
Uh? Hey!

19:44.916 --> 19:45.849
Yeah, that's it.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.485
Keep dancing,
Bone Dome! Ha ha.

19:49.787 --> 19:53.056
Oh, I finally get
to sit one out.

19:53.058 --> 19:56.693
Wow, is there anything
you can't do, Miss Agatha?

19:56.695 --> 19:59.028
Well, actually,
I've never tried

19:59.030 --> 20:02.499
bronco-busting wild yaks
in the Himalayas.

20:02.501 --> 20:04.334
But I'm sure she will.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.935
I hate to say it,
guys,

20:05.937 --> 20:07.604
but things
don't look too good.

20:07.606 --> 20:10.607
Just the same,
we'll go down fighting!

20:16.948 --> 20:19.049
Maybe sooner than we think.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.451
Hey, let me have
a crack at it.

20:23.321 --> 20:25.622
Oh, crack is
the right word.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.424
Step aside,
compadres.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.827
Let me grapple
with the problem.

20:31.596 --> 20:32.930
Got it!

20:32.932 --> 20:34.665
Whoa!

20:34.667 --> 20:36.400
Ohh!

20:43.174 --> 20:44.208
[Donatello]
Way to go!

20:44.210 --> 20:45.976
All right,
Michelangelo!

20:45.978 --> 20:48.812
Now will you
come quietly,
Professor?

20:48.814 --> 20:51.148
You're too late,
you meddling old biddie.

20:51.150 --> 20:54.618
I've just activated
my Doomsday Device.

20:58.256 --> 21:02.026
And the key has just
been de-molecularized.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.894
The world has exactly
20 seconds to destruction.

21:04.896 --> 21:07.931
Revenge is mine!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

21:10.634 --> 21:13.136
Bummer, dudes.
We're missing the party.

21:13.138 --> 21:15.205
Listen to all
that laughing.

21:15.207 --> 21:18.075
I'm afraid, in this case,
it's the last laugh.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.175
We've got 15 seconds

21:19.177 --> 21:20.711
till the end
of the world, guys!

21:20.713 --> 21:23.914
It's not possible.
There must be some way
to stop it.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.749
It's useless,
my green friend.

21:25.751 --> 21:27.584
We're all leaving here
together

21:27.586 --> 21:29.620
in precisely
seven seconds.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.188
Ha ha ha ha ha!

21:31.190 --> 21:34.391
Now, where did I
put that thing?

21:34.393 --> 21:36.193
Ah, yes. Here it is.

21:36.195 --> 21:39.763
This used to work
on my bathroom door.

21:42.567 --> 21:43.767
There.
[machine
shutting down]

21:43.769 --> 21:45.502
So much for blowing up
the world.

21:45.504 --> 21:48.905
Oh, next time, could you
not play it quite so close?

21:48.907 --> 21:51.241
These cliffhangers
are tough on the nerves!

21:51.243 --> 21:52.476
[Raphael]
Now what?

21:52.478 --> 21:54.144
[Donatello]
The electromagnetic field

21:54.146 --> 21:56.013
created by this
crackpot's equipment

21:56.015 --> 21:58.515
is attracting
a thunderbolt
disturbance.

21:58.517 --> 22:00.884
Time to split,
muchachos!

22:00.886 --> 22:03.387
Hurry,
Miss Agatha!

22:03.389 --> 22:05.288
Now, we mustn't
forget the cat!

22:05.290 --> 22:08.091
[Donatello]
Or the Doomsday Device!

22:28.179 --> 22:30.180
[Leonardo]
Thanks for all your help,
Miss Agatha.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.381
Oh, you're welcome.

22:31.383 --> 22:33.150
This was
quite stimulating.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.585
Now, if you boys
ever want

22:34.587 --> 22:36.553
a guest shot
on my television show,

22:36.555 --> 22:38.288
just say the word.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.956
I think we'll pass.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.591
Just tell us who
the guilty party was

22:41.593 --> 22:42.826
in the "Missing Guppy Caper,"

22:42.828 --> 22:43.860
and we'll call it even.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.897
Very well.
You deserve to know.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.899
The thief was--

22:48.901 --> 22:50.300
Miss Agatha,
the studio's been

22:50.302 --> 22:51.635
looking all over
for you!

22:51.637 --> 22:54.037
You've got to finish
taping that episode.

22:54.039 --> 22:57.174
Of course. I mustn't
keep my public waiting.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.141
But-- But--

22:58.143 --> 22:59.877
Ta-ta!

23:01.212 --> 23:03.213
Bummer. Now we'll
have to wait

23:03.215 --> 23:06.883
for the summer reruns
to find out whodunit.
