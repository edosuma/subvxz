21:16.422 --> 21:24.630
♫

21:28.167 --> 21:31.204
Uh, Reese.

21:31.487 --> 21:34.423
You remember Assistant
District Attorney Griffiths.

21:34.957 --> 21:36.892
No reason to be so formal.

21:36.925 --> 21:38.461
Just call me Connie.

21:38.494 --> 21:40.095
Good to see you again, Connie.

21:40.128 --> 21:41.597
You too.

21:41.630 --> 21:42.831
I really like your dress.

21:42.865 --> 21:43.832
Thank you.

21:43.866 --> 21:45.668
I got it in New York.

21:45.701 --> 21:47.503
Constance went to New York.

21:47.536 --> 21:49.080
But then she had
to come back from New York.

21:49.104 --> 21:50.573
So now she's
not in New York anymore.

21:52.575 --> 21:55.844
I'm saying "New York"
a lot, aren't I?

21:55.878 --> 21:57.446
He does that sometimes.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.181
I know.
I usually just wait it out.

21:59.214 --> 22:02.451
Me too.

22:02.485 --> 22:04.620
Can we talk for a minute?

22:14.747 --> 22:16.348
Remember the last time
I came down here?

22:16.381 --> 22:18.150
I do.

22:18.183 --> 22:20.285
You warned me
to stay away from Ames.

22:20.318 --> 22:21.987
I wish you would have
listened to me.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.321
I didn't kill him.

22:23.355 --> 22:24.957
We know you didn't.

22:24.990 --> 22:26.358
"We"?

22:26.641 --> 22:28.543
That's why I'm here.

22:28.576 --> 22:30.312
I thought that
you would like to know

22:30.345 --> 22:31.546
that we have moved off you

22:31.579 --> 22:32.656
as a suspect
in the Ames killing.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.549
But I was such a good suspect.

22:34.582 --> 22:36.451
You were an excellent suspect.

22:36.484 --> 22:39.121
If I'm not the suspect, who is?

22:41.556 --> 22:43.258
There's another suspect,
isn't there?

22:45.560 --> 22:46.528
Okay.

22:46.561 --> 22:48.130
What's with the dress?

22:48.163 --> 22:49.264
Going to dinner.

22:49.297 --> 22:50.332
The Little Door.

22:50.365 --> 22:52.567
Oh, romantic.

22:55.803 --> 22:57.639
I don't want to be late.

23:03.211 --> 23:04.679
Most homicides that are solved

23:04.712 --> 23:07.415
are done so
in the first 48 hours.

23:07.449 --> 23:09.360
Interviewer:
Can you comment
on the Internet reports

23:09.384 --> 23:10.352
that the LAPD

23:10.385 --> 23:14.356
does not want the Ames killing solved?

23:14.389 --> 23:15.657
It is the desire

23:15.690 --> 23:17.659
of the Los Angeles
Police Department

23:17.692 --> 23:21.029
to have every case solved.

23:21.063 --> 23:24.732
What can I do for you, Jack?

23:24.766 --> 23:26.301
You can explain to me

23:26.334 --> 23:27.702
why your Detective Crews

23:27.735 --> 23:31.606
is no longer a suspect
in the Carl Ames shooting.

23:31.639 --> 23:33.708
He killed Ames.
He had the motivation.

23:33.741 --> 23:35.810
You find the means
and opportunity.

23:35.843 --> 23:38.513
I'm gonna be very careful
what I say now, Jack.

23:38.546 --> 23:42.250
I have a witness
who reports seeing two men

23:42.284 --> 23:44.652
leaving the scene
of the Ames killing.

23:44.686 --> 23:46.688
When we find these men,
if they connect to Crews,

23:46.721 --> 23:48.590
I will go after Crews.

23:48.623 --> 23:51.493
If they connect
to somebody else,

23:51.526 --> 23:53.561
that's who I will go after.

23:56.464 --> 23:57.699
15 years ago

23:57.732 --> 23:59.143
this branch of
the Bank of Los Angeles

23:59.167 --> 24:00.535
was held up.

24:00.568 --> 24:02.504
There was a shootout.

24:02.537 --> 24:04.339
$18 million goes missing.

24:04.372 --> 24:05.473
A small group of gunmen

24:05.507 --> 24:07.375
could hold out in here forever

24:07.409 --> 24:09.811
against the cops
out on the street.

24:09.844 --> 24:11.413
The only way to take 'em out

24:11.446 --> 24:13.381
would be with a sniper.

24:13.415 --> 24:15.483
And there's only one place

24:15.517 --> 24:17.385
that sniper could take the shot.

24:21.356 --> 24:22.457
I don't like heights.

24:22.490 --> 24:24.492
Then don't look down.

24:30.698 --> 24:32.234
Oh, I looked down.

24:32.267 --> 24:34.236
I couldn't help myself.

24:34.269 --> 24:35.337
Oh, I looked down again.

24:35.370 --> 24:37.505
If you want a clean shot
of that bank,

24:37.539 --> 24:39.374
the only place to do it

24:39.407 --> 24:40.708
is from here.

24:40.742 --> 24:42.444
Right here.

24:42.477 --> 24:44.312
This is where S.W.A.T.
Happened to be training

24:44.346 --> 24:46.381
the day the bank
of Los Angeles was held up.

24:46.414 --> 24:48.216
S.W.A.T. leader
was Jack Reese.

24:48.250 --> 24:50.185
Jack Reese was talking with Ames

24:50.218 --> 24:53.588
right before Ames got killed.

24:53.621 --> 24:55.157
I scared Ames.

24:55.190 --> 24:56.291
Ames went to Reese.

24:56.324 --> 24:57.335
They were arguing about me.

24:57.359 --> 24:59.227
I saw 'em say my name.

24:59.261 --> 25:00.162
Now Ames is dead.

25:00.195 --> 25:02.630
What does the bank
of Los Angeles holdup

25:02.664 --> 25:04.299
have to do with the detective

25:04.332 --> 25:05.600
who put you away?

25:05.633 --> 25:07.802
They both have
Jack Reese in common.

25:10.805 --> 25:14.276
Charlie, I'm not Robin, am I?

25:14.309 --> 25:16.311
You know, Batman and Robin.

25:16.344 --> 25:17.645
Trusty sidekick.

25:17.679 --> 25:18.813
You mean, like, in tights?

25:22.317 --> 25:23.618
No, Ted.

25:23.651 --> 25:26.120
You are not Robin.

25:34.296 --> 25:37.265
You're not here.

25:37.299 --> 25:38.733
Are you?

25:38.766 --> 25:40.468
No, I'm here, Eric.

25:40.502 --> 25:42.404
Don't you worry.

25:42.437 --> 25:44.306
Why'd you run from us?

25:46.308 --> 25:47.875
'Cause when you came back
I could see

25:47.909 --> 25:49.611
you found out I lied to you.

25:49.644 --> 25:51.246
We found out about the fight.

25:51.279 --> 25:52.580
About how you

25:52.614 --> 25:54.216
nearly killed Tim Chang.

25:54.249 --> 25:58.286
We found out you got
thrown out of the Zen Center.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.887
Master Chang banished you.

25:59.921 --> 26:01.956
And others weren't even
allowed to speak your name.

26:01.989 --> 26:03.358
That make you angry, Eric?

26:03.391 --> 26:05.893
That'd make me angry.

26:05.927 --> 26:06.970
Is that what you fought about?

26:06.994 --> 26:09.497
We fought about trust.

26:09.531 --> 26:12.234
Did he betray your trust?

26:13.935 --> 26:16.338
All I had was Master Chang

26:16.371 --> 26:18.906
and the Zen Center.

26:18.940 --> 26:22.210
On my own, who I was,

26:22.244 --> 26:23.311
was nothing.

26:23.345 --> 26:25.313
They were--

26:25.347 --> 26:28.816
everything to you.

26:28.850 --> 26:30.952
How did he betray your trust?

26:30.985 --> 26:33.221
Was it because of something
he was doing himself?

26:33.255 --> 26:34.489
No, what he did to himself,

26:34.522 --> 26:36.658
he did somewhere else.

26:36.691 --> 26:37.935
Did he do something
at the Zen Center?

26:37.959 --> 26:40.362
The girls that came
in that center,

26:40.395 --> 26:43.365
they trusted Master Chang.

26:43.398 --> 26:46.568
He would take 'em to his office.

26:46.601 --> 26:51.005
I mean, he broke the trust
for pretty girls.

26:51.038 --> 26:52.974
That trust,

26:53.007 --> 26:55.843
it was all I had.

26:55.877 --> 26:57.279
All we have is his body.

26:57.312 --> 26:59.547
So you're gonna stay
with us awhile

26:59.581 --> 27:01.349
until we see
if you left anything behind

27:01.383 --> 27:02.484
when you buried him.

27:02.517 --> 27:05.487
I didn't kill him.

27:05.520 --> 27:06.921
I loved him.

27:06.954 --> 27:09.991
I wanted to kill him.

27:10.024 --> 27:13.828
Yeah, I tried to kill him.

27:13.861 --> 27:14.862
But I didn't.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.834
I loved him.

27:23.471 --> 27:24.772
If he banished you,

27:24.806 --> 27:26.374
how come he called you?

27:26.408 --> 27:29.777
He called to say good-bye.

27:29.811 --> 27:31.946
He said he was leaving.

27:31.979 --> 27:34.816
But wouldn't say why.

27:42.624 --> 27:45.793
You said you were Master Chang.

27:45.827 --> 27:47.795
You said you were lost.

27:56.738 --> 27:58.706
Just to be clear about this,

27:58.740 --> 28:00.708
I am not talking to a dead guy.

28:00.742 --> 28:01.776
I don't talk to dead guys.

28:01.809 --> 28:03.010
I'm talking to myself.

28:03.044 --> 28:06.381
There just--just happens
to be a dead guy here.

28:08.416 --> 28:10.718
The man who killed my friends,

28:10.752 --> 28:13.755
the man I served
those 12 years for,

28:17.392 --> 28:19.661
what do I do when I find him?

28:23.598 --> 28:25.900
Okay.

28:25.933 --> 28:28.736
Good talking to you.

28:31.072 --> 28:33.307
I'm gonna go find your killer.

28:35.743 --> 28:37.579
Eric thought you
were Master Chang.

28:37.612 --> 28:39.447
He'd just been hit by a car.

28:48.723 --> 28:50.725
Reese.

28:50.758 --> 28:52.627
Come meditate with me.

28:52.660 --> 28:53.761
That's okay.

28:53.795 --> 28:54.962
I think I'll just watch.

28:54.996 --> 28:56.130
It will make you happy.

28:56.163 --> 28:58.132
It's not gonna make me happy.

28:58.165 --> 29:00.502
If it doesn't make you happy,
I promise not to say

29:00.535 --> 29:02.604
another word to you
for the rest of the day.

29:02.637 --> 29:05.006
Where else are you gonna
get an offer like that?

29:05.039 --> 29:06.474
All right.

29:06.508 --> 29:07.509
How do I do this?

29:07.542 --> 29:09.544
Look straight ahead.

29:25.059 --> 29:26.561
See?

29:26.594 --> 29:28.596
Happy?

29:34.886 --> 29:36.320
So everyone going to
that Zen Center

29:36.353 --> 29:37.789
was just completely screwed up.

29:37.822 --> 29:38.823
Right?

29:38.856 --> 29:41.158
People go there seeking peace.

29:41.192 --> 29:44.829
People seek
what they don't have.

29:44.862 --> 29:47.098
Only troubled people seek peace.

29:47.131 --> 29:49.701
I've changed my mind.

29:49.734 --> 29:51.703
I want to come back as a panda.

29:51.736 --> 29:52.704
Really?

29:52.737 --> 29:54.138
They're so cute.

29:54.171 --> 29:54.972
They're not cute.

29:55.006 --> 29:56.073
They just seem cute.

29:56.107 --> 29:58.075
They're actually very mean.

30:01.012 --> 30:02.690
We just have one thing
we need to clear up.

30:02.714 --> 30:03.848
It's not a big thing.

30:03.881 --> 30:05.192
We need to know
if you lied to us.

30:05.216 --> 30:06.350
Excuse me?

30:06.383 --> 30:08.119
What Detective Reese means
is when you said

30:08.152 --> 30:10.955
did not have a relationship
with Master Chang,

30:10.988 --> 30:11.923
did you lie about the part

30:11.956 --> 30:13.796
where you had a relationship
with Master Chang?

30:13.825 --> 30:15.326
You went to

30:15.359 --> 30:18.362
the Zen Center too,
didn't you, Amy?

30:18.395 --> 30:19.430
That's you.

30:19.463 --> 30:21.165
Younger, but you, right?

30:21.198 --> 30:23.968
I would drive Luke there.

30:24.001 --> 30:25.703
He's not a very good driver.

30:25.737 --> 30:27.014
His mind is always
somewhere else.

30:27.038 --> 30:28.072
I understand that.

30:28.105 --> 30:31.142
Detective Reese
doesn't let me drive.

30:31.175 --> 30:32.744
Reese:
We also heard
that Master Chang

30:32.777 --> 30:34.111
would take you into his office

30:34.145 --> 30:36.080
for a little
one on one enlightenment

30:36.113 --> 30:38.115
while your Professor
was out on the mat.

30:38.149 --> 30:39.951
That's not true.

30:39.984 --> 30:41.052
Who said that?

30:41.085 --> 30:42.754
Who sits in the third chair?

30:42.787 --> 30:43.888
It's a trio.

30:43.921 --> 30:45.790
You and your husband play?

30:45.823 --> 30:46.924
Yes.

30:46.958 --> 30:48.001
Who sits in the third chair?

30:48.025 --> 30:50.728
My son.

30:50.762 --> 30:52.396
I'd like you to leave.

30:52.429 --> 30:54.131
Did your husband Luke
know that you

30:54.165 --> 30:55.432
were having sex with Tim Chang?

30:55.466 --> 30:57.769
I wasn't.
That is a lie.

30:57.802 --> 30:59.270
As a rule,
older men get really upset

30:59.303 --> 31:00.772
about stuff like that.

31:00.805 --> 31:01.982
Is it true
that those Zen Masters

31:02.006 --> 31:03.140
know all the secret places?

31:03.174 --> 31:04.241
Okay, that's enough.

31:04.275 --> 31:06.010
I won't be offended
in my own house.

31:06.043 --> 31:07.344
[Door opens]

31:14.786 --> 31:15.853
Alec,

31:15.887 --> 31:17.254
say hello

31:17.288 --> 31:18.790
to detectives Crews and Reese.

31:18.823 --> 31:21.325
Hello.

31:28.900 --> 31:30.501
It was a pleasure to meet you.

31:33.270 --> 31:36.874
He is a very respectful child.

31:36.908 --> 31:38.409
Yes.

31:38.442 --> 31:40.011
Yes, he is.

31:40.044 --> 31:42.914
How old is he?

31:42.947 --> 31:45.850
Just about ten.

31:48.069 --> 31:50.071
May I ask who
his birth parents are?

31:52.656 --> 31:54.925
I am his birth mother.

31:54.958 --> 31:57.027
But we had trouble conceiving.

31:57.060 --> 31:58.629
And his father?

31:58.662 --> 32:01.298
It was an anonymous donor.

32:01.332 --> 32:02.742
Reese:
You understand
why we're gonna

32:02.766 --> 32:05.001
need to see proof of that.

32:05.035 --> 32:07.037
Of course.
We have the documents.

32:07.070 --> 32:09.440
