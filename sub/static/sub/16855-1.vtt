02:58.734 --> 03:00.118
Oh!  Dang!

03:00.823 --> 03:01.845
Something the matter?

03:01.846 --> 03:06.147
Oh my God!   Ned hasn't been here for a
month, now he can't come for another week.

03:06.148 --> 03:08.100
Aren't they all the same.
Useless!

03:08.301 --> 03:11.048
Oh look!  I'm sorry about all
the dust all over your bushes.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.592
But the builder has just finished
my new driveway today.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.905
Thank heavens.
I never saw such a mess.

03:16.306 --> 03:19.335
Oh, we're off now Mrs Parker.
Hope you're happy with the job.

03:19.636 --> 03:22.698
Let young Tim to tidy up.  So if
you want anything, just tell him.

03:22.699 --> 03:23.745
Bye now.

03:34.562 --> 03:38.590
Same thing everyday.  The poor little
bugger always gets all the dirty work.

03:40.871 --> 03:42.255
Hi Tim!

03:44.667 --> 03:48.056
Throw the hose over Ms Horton's
bushes before you go, will you dear?

03:48.057 --> 03:51.264
- That's a good boy.  Right?
- Right on Mrs Parker.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.925
Good looking isn't he?

03:55.185 --> 03:58.802
Not over bright, mind you.
But a nice kid.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.183
You must have seen
him working around here.

04:01.384 --> 04:02.661
No, I haven't.

04:02.762 --> 04:03.842
Ah, of course.

04:03.843 --> 04:06.788
You'd always left for the office before
the builders got here in the morning.

04:06.789 --> 04:10.338
Oh anyway, sorry about the dust on your
bushes.   But Tim will take care of it.

04:10.813 --> 04:14.233
Well, things to do.
See you.

05:25.622 --> 05:26.717
Hello.

05:28.108 --> 05:29.980
Thanks so much for doing that.
I appreciate it.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.012
Oh, that's alright.

05:31.113 --> 05:33.828
Would you like to do some
work around the place for me?

05:33.829 --> 05:34.981
What kind of work?

05:35.248 --> 05:37.464
Well, the garden's a mess.

05:37.465 --> 05:40.173
The man who usually does it
for me hurt his back or something.

05:40.574 --> 05:46.051
If you could just, tidy up and cut the
grass.   I have a mower in the back.

05:46.052 --> 05:50.522
- Have you?
- Would you like to do the work or not?

05:50.523 --> 05:54.185
Pay me to do or what?
When you want me to start?

05:54.386 --> 05:59.489
- Tomorrow morning.
- Alright.  Bye.

05:59.690 --> 06:02.745
- What's your name?
- Tim.

06:04.987 --> 06:10.876
- Ooh!  Tim Melville.  Bye!
- Goodbye.

06:32.383 --> 06:35.233
- Hi boys.  Everything all right?
- Yeah, thanks.

06:51.299 --> 06:53.636
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Your box too.

06:55.179 --> 06:56.550
- Hi.
- Hi kid.

06:58.759 --> 07:01.744
Another mini for Tim, love.
Oh, make it all around.

07:01.745 --> 07:03.324
You like where you've been?

07:03.325 --> 07:07.643
Oh, finished that job today and
Harry left us behind to tidy up.

07:07.644 --> 07:08.795
It was the overtime.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.852
- Got another job too.
- Yeah.

07:15.695 --> 07:18.398
- Can I have another one, dad?
- Well, take it easy.

07:18.399 --> 07:20.655
You drink fast like
that, you'll get pissed.

07:20.856 --> 07:23.359
Well, sorry.
I was thirsty.  Can I?

07:23.560 --> 07:26.961
Oh, in a minute.
Where's the other job?

07:27.662 --> 07:30.052
Lady next door wants
me to cut the grass.

07:30.553 --> 07:34.249
- Next door to where?
- Next door to where we were today.

07:34.350 --> 07:36.307
Now where does she
want the grass cut, Tim?

07:36.308 --> 07:38.150
Front, back or otherwise, heh?

07:38.351 --> 07:41.658
Shut your big trap, Billy.  Tim don't
understand that kind of talk.

07:41.659 --> 07:44.309
- Sorry, well I was only kidding.
- Well, done!

07:44.810 --> 07:49.136
Did you say you'll do the job?
Shut up, or I'll flatten you!

07:50.237 --> 07:52.218
- Did you?
- Tomorrow morning.

07:52.219 --> 07:55.138
Good.
Extra money would come in handy.

07:55.739 --> 08:02.342
- What sort of a lady is she?
- Aw, you know, sort of an older lady.

08:02.343 --> 08:05.320
- Lives in a big place.
- I know that is.

08:05.621 --> 08:11.539
- Rich old biddy?
- I don't know.  Drives a big car back.

08:11.740 --> 08:13.324
She's a real nice lady.

08:13.325 --> 08:15.547
Well, they're all nice
as long as I'll be in it.

08:15.848 --> 08:18.246
Can't you get your
mind on something else?

08:19.147 --> 08:22.656
Want another beer?
Good a choice you have.

08:22.857 --> 08:25.798
- Gather around, please boys.
- Okay.

08:53.006 --> 08:53.916
Sit here.

08:54.517 --> 08:55.512
Hi mom!

08:56.213 --> 08:58.896
- Hello, mother.
- Don't mother me.

08:59.697 --> 09:03.237
- You didn't ruin.
- Oh, you're saving him.

09:08.122 --> 09:11.761
- What's to eat?
- As if you'd learn when you pull a beer.

09:11.762 --> 09:15.471
- Yum, you have the usual.
- And that's usually one too many.

09:15.672 --> 09:19.095
It's Friday.
What do you always get on a Friday?

09:19.296 --> 09:22.311
Fish and chips.
As usual.

09:24.496 --> 09:26.023
Now get that in here.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.771
I like fish and chips.

09:33.372 --> 09:35.889
Didn't matter what I
gave you, Tim, would it?

09:35.890 --> 09:37.951
You'd always say
it was your favourite.

09:38.052 --> 09:39.731
Catch up with you later.

09:39.732 --> 09:41.915
There's a good movie on the
telly.  Don't want to miss it.

09:41.916 --> 09:43.016
Yes love.

09:45.070 --> 09:47.787
Get your father a glass.
I'm having a drink.

09:51.530 --> 09:52.830
Good boy.

10:34.922 --> 10:37.046
- Who is it?
- Me.

10:38.445 --> 10:41.046
Who?  Who is it?
Who is that?

10:41.047 --> 10:44.408
Me.  Tim.
Tim Melville.

11:02.507 --> 11:06.336
- Hello.
- Hello.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.841
- You know what time it is?
- Hmm. 7 o'clock.

11:10.542 --> 11:15.155
- You always start work this early?
- Every time.  Monday to Friday.

11:15.256 --> 11:17.544
- This is Saturday.
- Hmm.

11:19.870 --> 11:22.264
Oh well.   I'll show you
where the mower is.

11:38.650 --> 11:42.974
- You think you can manage that?
- No worries. I'm good with machineries.

11:42.975 --> 11:45.477
Well, is there anything
else you need, Mr Melville?

11:45.478 --> 11:49.151
You keep on calling me Mr Melville.
I'm not Mr Melville.

11:49.352 --> 11:52.328
I'm Tim Melville.
My dad is Mr Melville.

11:54.097 --> 11:58.156
- Well, I'll leave it to you, Tim.
- Right on, Mrs ...

11:58.157 --> 12:02.231
Please.  I'm not Mrs,
I'm Miss Horton.

12:02.232 --> 12:05.166
Right on, Miss Horton.
Anything you say.

14:16.372 --> 14:19.599
Tim.
Cup of tea.

14:27.986 --> 14:28.969
Sit down.

14:31.780 --> 14:34.710
- How do you like your tea?
- No milk.  Lots of sugar.

14:34.711 --> 14:35.937
Do help yourself.

14:57.894 --> 14:59.996
I just put it in
till it's sweet enough.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.721
- Cake.
- I like chocolate cake.

15:09.722 --> 15:11.987
Especially when it's got
a lot of cream inside.

15:25.388 --> 15:28.553
- Good book?
- Yes.  It's very interesting.

15:34.105 --> 15:38.248
- I don't like books much.
- What do you read?

15:38.849 --> 15:42.429
- Don't.
- You don't read anything?

15:42.430 --> 15:46.403
- Can't.
- You can't read?

15:49.040 --> 15:50.209
Or write.

15:53.564 --> 15:55.950
- You went to school?
- Mmm.

15:56.569 --> 16:01.060
But I couldn't learn, so mom and
dad didn't make me keep on going.

16:03.904 --> 16:06.904
I'm not a fool quitting,
anyone will tell you that.

16:16.933 --> 16:21.733
- How old were you when you left school?
- Well, about fifteen.

16:23.435 --> 16:27.634
- How old are you now?
- Twenty four.

16:27.866 --> 16:29.177
And a ... man.

16:33.249 --> 16:37.276
- This is good, Miss Horton.
- Please call me Mary.

16:39.211 --> 16:40.810
I don't know.
You sure?

16:41.211 --> 16:45.892
Well, dad says I should never call older
people anything but Mr or Mrs or Miss.

16:46.568 --> 16:49.098
- I'm not that old.
- Huh.

16:51.408 --> 16:52.422
Well!

16:55.849 --> 16:57.552
Got to get back to work.

16:58.401 --> 17:02.896
If you don't finish up you can come back
another day.   Maybe next Saturday.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.699
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
As long as dad says I can.

17:10.287 --> 17:13.289
Oh, I like you.
I really do.

17:13.890 --> 17:17.699
Or better than anyone except mom
and dad and Dawnie.  She's my sister.

17:17.700 --> 17:21.189
Oh, thank you.  That's
very nice of you to say that.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.348
Think nothing of it.

17:31.113 --> 17:33.747
That was my special
imitation of a kangaroo.

17:33.748 --> 17:38.606
Oh, that was very good, Tim.
I can tell right away.

17:55.395 --> 17:58.380
Oh, I've finished out here, if you
want to come and take a look.

17:58.381 --> 17:59.908
And then I'll start on the back.

18:00.109 --> 18:02.570
Oh, please don't worry
about finishing today.

18:02.671 --> 18:06.308
You can come back next Saturday.
If your father says it's alright.

18:06.309 --> 18:08.574
Alright, alright.
Whatever you say.

18:08.875 --> 18:13.121
Well, come inside and wash up.
Bathroom's right over there.

18:24.568 --> 18:25.844
Gee, nice house.

18:27.998 --> 18:30.250
Come take a look at the rest of it.

18:39.091 --> 18:40.263
Lots of books.

18:45.435 --> 18:46.777
This is a nice house.

18:51.761 --> 18:53.226
Isn't it beautiful.

18:53.727 --> 18:56.378
It's my favourite colour, blue.

18:56.879 --> 19:01.633
It's very old.  It belonged to my mother.
That was her favourite colour too.

19:07.251 --> 19:11.134
The bathroom's right through there.
I left out the towel and soap for you.

19:11.135 --> 19:12.949
Well then, thanks.

19:40.551 --> 19:43.358
My name and address are
written on a piece of paper inside.

19:43.359 --> 19:46.266
Would you give this to your father so
that he and mother will know who I am?

19:46.267 --> 19:48.976
Got that.  Thanks.
Goodbye.

19:49.277 --> 19:53.233
- Don't forget to give it to him.
- I never forget anything when I'm told.

19:53.234 --> 19:57.052
- I didn't think you would.
- Goodbye Miss Horton.

19:57.253 --> 20:00.940
- Mary.
- Goodbye Mary.

20:10.268 --> 20:11.911
- Oh hi!
- Oh hi, son.

20:11.912 --> 20:13.976
- Want a beer?
- Wouldn't mind.

20:14.177 --> 20:15.477
Get another bottle.

20:30.925 --> 20:33.274
- So how did it go today?
- Real good.

20:33.475 --> 20:36.191
- Mary's nice.
- Mary?

20:36.192 --> 20:39.455
Miss Horton.
She told me to call her that.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.243
I did not at first, you know,

20:41.244 --> 20:44.078
after all you said about what did
she call all the people in there.

20:44.679 --> 20:48.752
She said it was all right.
All right isn't it?

20:48.953 --> 20:51.747
Well, it's about how she said, son.

20:53.321 --> 20:57.028
Did she pay you like she promised?

21:06.228 --> 21:07.728
Twenty dollars.

21:10.728 --> 21:13.540
- I'll look after it for you, right?
- Right.

21:22.076 --> 21:24.083
She wants me to come
again next Saturday, too.

21:24.084 --> 21:25.987
- Didn't you finish?
- No.

21:28.513 --> 21:33.553
Well son, if she's willing to pay,
you can front up next Saturday.

21:35.028 --> 21:37.497
Whatever you say, quite a bargain.

22:09.388 --> 22:10.714
That looks nice.

22:13.011 --> 22:14.531
Not bad, eh?

22:30.763 --> 22:34.366
- Come up to the patio and have some tea.
- Sure.

23:23.693 --> 23:26.087
- Get the phone, will you Tim?
- Mm.

23:32.016 --> 23:37.227
Hello.  Who?
Oh, Mary.  Hello.

23:38.828 --> 23:42.146
What?
Oh, yeah, he's here.

23:42.347 --> 23:45.935
Dad, it's for you.
Mary.

23:46.036 --> 23:48.273
- Who?
- Miss Horton.

23:55.257 --> 23:58.240
Hello.
Yes, Miss Horton.

23:58.441 --> 24:00.482
That would be ....
How are you?

24:00.483 --> 24:03.849
I'm fine, thank you.
A favour?

24:06.153 --> 24:08.804
Well, I don't see why not.

24:09.005 --> 24:13.149
You'd like Tim to help you down
at the beach.  That will be alright.

24:13.750 --> 24:17.039
I'm sure Tim won't mind.
He enjoys working for you.

24:17.040 --> 24:21.334
Good.  Do you want to talk to him?
Just a minute.

24:21.888 --> 24:24.424
Miss Horton wants
to talk to you again.

24:26.739 --> 24:27.932
Hello.

24:30.596 --> 24:34.196
Yeah, that will be nice, Mary.
I'd like that.

24:34.697 --> 24:36.212
Next weekend.

24:40.397 --> 24:41.980
Goodbye Mary.

24:44.290 --> 24:49.482
Did you hear that?
I'm going to the beach with Mary.

24:58.551 --> 25:03.399
- You ever been up here before?
- No. Don't get out much. None of us do.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.540
All, except Dawnie,
that's my sister.

25:06.541 --> 25:08.906
She even went
overseas once for a holiday.

25:09.407 --> 25:11.409
Have you ever been on the seas?

25:11.710 --> 25:14.976
- I was born in America.
- Oh.

26:04.809 --> 26:07.215
Take your bag.   We're
gonna leave the car here.

26:07.216 --> 26:08.262
Okay.

26:14.209 --> 26:16.689
- I got it.
- Good.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.732
I have to pick up some things.

26:26.030 --> 26:29.760
- Mr Thompson, hello.
- Hello, Ms Horton. Got your order ready.

26:31.213 --> 26:34.776
That will be S12.10.
Make it $12 even.

26:34.877 --> 26:36.558
This is Tim, Mr Thompson.

26:36.559 --> 26:38.221
- Hello son.
-Hi.

26:41.140 --> 26:42.779
We're gonna take the jeep.

26:53.409 --> 26:54.569
Heh heh.

26:56.332 --> 26:59.036
I've never been for a
ride on the beach before.

27:01.307 --> 27:03.085
Listen.
It's fun.

27:06.229 --> 27:09.013
Sit down or you'll fall off.

27:14.068 --> 27:15.275
Heh heh heh.

27:30.311 --> 27:32.424
Oh, this is nice.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.872
- Let me help you.
- I got it.

27:53.416 --> 27:57.575
Well, I think that's
enough work for today.

27:59.409 --> 28:01.591
- Would you like to go surfing?
- Oh yes!

28:01.592 --> 28:03.418
Look, I brought my
swimming trunks like you said.

28:03.419 --> 28:05.898
Oh good.  You go change
and I'll get you some towels.

28:05.899 --> 28:06.998
All right.

28:22.420 --> 28:23.739
What's the matter?

28:26.508 --> 28:28.196
You said we were going swimming.

28:28.197 --> 28:31.896
Oh!  Not me, you.
I haven't been near the water in years.

28:32.197 --> 28:34.502
Well, you have to come
swimming with me, Mary.

28:34.503 --> 28:37.757
Oh, I'm sorry.
I burn so easily.

28:37.758 --> 28:41.319
But it won't be the same.
Look, I can't go swimming all by myself.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.284
Please come swimming with me, Mary.

28:43.685 --> 28:46.224
I don't even know if I have
a bathing suit down here.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.112
Well, go and take a look, please.

28:48.213 --> 28:49.812
Please go and take a look.

28:51.574 --> 28:53.468
Alright, I'll take a look.

29:27.930 --> 29:31.389
- You found one?
- Yes.

29:38.054 --> 29:41.373
- Now we can go swimming.
- Yes.

30:09.985 --> 30:13.851
How come if you live down here,
you never go to the beach?

30:14.366 --> 30:15.408
Well.

30:15.509 --> 30:17.343
If I live here, I'll go to
the beach everyday.

30:17.344 --> 30:19.685
- It is beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

30:22.687 --> 30:25.360
- Where do you want me to put the chair?
- This is fine.

30:34.708 --> 30:36.107
Are you coming?

30:36.593 --> 30:41.152
- Ah, I'll check the water.
- Come on.  Let's go in.

30:41.153 --> 30:45.335
Let me give it a try.  Wait a
minute, I forgot the shoes.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.525
Come on.

31:01.952 --> 31:03.323
Go on.
Nice.

31:07.947 --> 31:08.954
Come on!

31:17.068 --> 31:19.804
- Where are you going?
- Oh, it's too cold.

31:20.264 --> 31:21.679
- Come on back!
- Oh!

31:26.374 --> 31:28.498
Oh!  It's so cold.

31:28.499 --> 31:30.633
- Are you coming in?
- No, I'll stay right here.

31:30.634 --> 31:32.323
Alright, I'll go for a dip.

31:56.575 --> 31:59.574
- Are you sure you won't come in?
- Oh, I can't.  It's too cold.

31:59.575 --> 32:01.526
Alright, let's go for
a run on the beach.

32:01.527 --> 32:02.845
Alright!

32:42.109 --> 32:44.293
Hey, turn your lights out.

32:46.597 --> 32:48.997
Goodbye Mary.
Thanks for taking me to the beach.

32:48.998 --> 32:51.191
- Goodnight Tim.
- Goodbye.

32:59.846 --> 33:02.622
So that's Mary Horton.

33:05.168 --> 33:06.094
Who?

33:07.548 --> 33:11.327
- Tim works for her weekends.
- Aah.

33:39.425 --> 33:45.244
I think, that's about
enough of it for one night.

33:48.612 --> 33:53.929
- Are you happy?
- What do you think?

34:05.986 --> 34:07.858
Have a cup of tea, son?

34:10.974 --> 34:14.737
No, thanks, mom.  I'm sleepy.
I think I'll go to bed.

34:15.940 --> 34:18.915
- Alright then, son.
- Goodnight mom, goodnight dad.

34:18.916 --> 34:20.186
Goodnight son.

34:24.790 --> 34:27.286
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

34:48.788 --> 34:50.885
- Hello Dawnie.
- Oh, good day Tim.

34:50.886 --> 34:52.998
- Been out tonight, eh?
- Yeah, with Mick.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.931
- How did the weekend go?
- Oh, great.

34:54.931 --> 34:57.337
I want you to see
what Mary gave me.

34:58.403 --> 35:00.950
- How about that?
- Oh yeah.

35:00.951 --> 35:03.668
The Wind in the Willows.
I read it at school.

35:03.703 --> 35:06.070
It's all about animals
that talk like people.

35:07.171 --> 35:10.266
Mary's been teaching me to read.
She says I'm doing real good.

35:10.267 --> 35:14.013
- You want to hear me read out.
- Oh, not now, Tim.  I'm a bit tired.

35:14.014 --> 35:15.708
- Tomorrow maybe, heh?
- Alright.

35:15.709 --> 35:19.333
- Alright Dawnie.
- Goodnight Tim.  Sleep tight.

35:25.747 --> 35:29.840
- Hello mom, hello dad.
- Oh, so late, Dawnie.

35:37.563 --> 35:41.042
- Just saw the elusive Ms Horton.
- Ohh.

35:41.343 --> 35:45.464
- Dropping Tim off.
- What's she like?

35:46.383 --> 35:48.160
I didn't get much
of a look at her really.

35:48.261 --> 35:50.376
Tim seems pretty
wrapped up with her.

35:50.877 --> 35:55.467
Why he's so amazed as to Mary this,
Mary that, drive me up the wall.

35:55.668 --> 35:58.949
- Do you know she's teaching him to read.
- Mm hmm.

35:58.950 --> 36:03.024
One of my book.  Should have
been a school teacher.

36:03.152 --> 36:05.002
The Wind in the Willows.

36:05.727 --> 36:09.728
Told us about it when he came home.
You want a cup of tea?

36:09.729 --> 36:12.020
- Yeah, I wont mind.
- Well?

36:22.823 --> 36:25.504
Sounds as though you're
a bit jealous of Ms Horton.

36:25.505 --> 36:28.139
Hmm.  Jealous?  Me?

36:28.140 --> 36:31.086
Well, the way you're talking.

36:31.187 --> 36:34.843
You think she was stealing your little
brother away from you or something.

36:35.344 --> 36:38.803
Well, who is she anyway?
We haven't met her.

36:38.804 --> 36:40.939
Sounds nice enough on the phone.

36:41.340 --> 36:44.423
What does she see in Tim, any how?

36:45.124 --> 36:47.537
What do you mean,
what does she see in him?

36:48.038 --> 36:50.241
Well, you know.

36:52.334 --> 36:54.578
She's good to him,
that's all I know.

36:56.268 --> 36:58.780
- Here you are.
- Oh, thanks mom.

37:04.865 --> 37:07.090
Any way, do what
you have with tonight.

37:07.191 --> 37:11.203
Well, the chairman of the board.
He's 92, but really sexy.

37:11.204 --> 37:13.036
Hmm.  Very funny.

37:14.337 --> 37:17.892
What I want to know is, what
do all these blokes see in you.

37:18.093 --> 37:19.561
Things you never do.

37:19.562 --> 37:22.677
None of that talk in this
house, thanks very much.

37:23.164 --> 37:24.847
Smart ass.

37:25.717 --> 37:29.679
Come on.  Who's this bloke you've
been knocking about with lately?

37:29.923 --> 37:32.499
- Which one?
- You know the one.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.725
The tall one.
He called you tonight.

37:34.926 --> 37:38.085
At least he didn't stood outside.
He came to the front door.

37:38.086 --> 37:41.544
Ah him.
Mick.  Mick Harrington.

37:42.188 --> 37:49.068
Well, as a matter of fact.
We're engaged to be married.

37:49.069 --> 37:51.406
- Engaged.
- Christ sake!

37:51.941 --> 37:53.467
- When did this happen?
- Tonight.

37:53.468 --> 37:57.493
- Oh, Dawnie, I'm so happy for you.
- Jesus Christ!

37:57.494 --> 38:00.115
He is the one, whose family’s
got nothing else but money.

38:00.116 --> 38:01.735
I don't know how we're
going to pay for the wedding.

38:01.736 --> 38:04.007
Oh come on.  That's what
I saved my money for.

38:04.008 --> 38:04.808
Is it?

38:04.809 --> 38:08.556
Yeah, I'm going to have a beautiful
wedding, lots of bridesmaid, the works.

38:08.557 --> 38:11.108
- Oh, we don't want you to be ashamed of us.
- No.

38:11.109 --> 38:15.854
No way.  You've brought me up in the
best and nicest and happiest of homes.

38:16.055 --> 38:17.821
That's why I love you both so much.

38:18.322 --> 38:19.713
And Micks okay.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.367
He's a bit of a sloth but I'll
soon knock that out of him.

38:25.752 --> 38:28.508
- Oh, goodnight Dawnie.
- Goodnight Dawnie.

38:29.112 --> 38:35.656
- Well, what do you think of that?
- I figure it's marvelous.

38:36.921 --> 38:40.284
Well, time to clear up this all.

38:41.907 --> 38:46.615
Oh, hard to believe.
I never thought of her husband.

38:46.616 --> 38:49.222
She was always too
much for me, that girl.

38:49.723 --> 38:53.862
- Mick ... Mick Harrington.
- Mrs Harrington.

38:58.682 --> 39:01.751
It came as a bit of a
shock to me.  I can tell you.

39:04.633 --> 39:08.141
- I'll give you a hand.
- Halt.  No.

39:08.442 --> 39:11.480
Don't you strain yourself.
You get off to bed.

39:14.005 --> 39:16.653
I hope Dawnie isn't
making a mistake.

39:16.654 --> 39:18.849
Oh, she'll be alright.

39:19.050 --> 39:22.398
- This Mick ... what's his name?
- Harrington.

39:23.874 --> 39:29.010
- Seems a bit of a pope to me.
- Alright.  You don't even know him.

39:29.011 --> 39:31.334
I saw him when he came to the door.

39:31.535 --> 39:34.393
Bet you never see him drinking
down at the pub with me and Tim.

39:35.362 --> 39:38.354
Oh Jesus.
I forgot all about Tim.

39:38.355 --> 39:40.397
He's always doted on Dawnie.

39:40.398 --> 39:42.597
He's the one that's gonna
miss her around the place.

39:51.194 --> 39:53.279
You're very quiet today.

40:14.970 --> 40:16.785
Where do you want these planted?

40:21.270 --> 40:24.118
Ah, what do you say we put
the Marigolds right over there?

40:25.821 --> 40:27.765
Whatever you say.

40:28.861 --> 40:35.577
- Well, what do you think?
- I don't know.  What ever you say.

40:44.908 --> 40:52.672
- Tim, is anything the matter?
- No.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.380
You've been so quiet today.

41:15.382 --> 41:17.337
Anything that I've done?

41:21.517 --> 41:22.713
No.

41:26.167 --> 41:29.965
- You've been doing any reading, lately?
- Mmm.

41:31.649 --> 41:33.529
Would you read for me now?

41:36.607 --> 41:37.824
Alright.

42:04.092 --> 42:10.055
It was a warm day ... and

42:10.056 --> 42:14.209
out of the hills ran

42:15.231 --> 42:22.041
ripply creeks ... of water

42:22.142 --> 42:25.357
ran on the rocks

42:25.358 --> 42:28.315
in pools where fish

42:28.316 --> 42:31.128
leapt on by

42:31.629 --> 42:42.520
and a little boy
was sitting on a rock

42:42.521 --> 42:44.121
by the road

42:44.122 --> 42:50.584
which in ... in his hand ...

42:53.694 --> 42:57.479
What is it?
What's the matter?

43:01.402 --> 43:02.743
Oh!

43:11.004 --> 43:12.940
Oh Tim.

43:16.684 --> 43:19.708
What's making you so unhappy?
Hmm.

43:24.462 --> 43:27.413
- She's going away.
- Who's going away?

43:27.914 --> 43:30.284
Dawnie, she's getting married.

43:30.285 --> 43:33.515
I don't want her to get married
and go away and live somewhere else.

43:33.916 --> 43:36.546
But that's part of getting married.

43:36.947 --> 43:41.055
That doesn't mean that she's not going
to love you as much as she always has.

43:42.966 --> 43:46.017
You wouldn't have to go
away and leave me, will you?

43:46.018 --> 43:47.610
No!.

43:48.111 --> 43:50.522
Not unless I die or something.

43:52.916 --> 43:57.856
What's die, Mary?
No one will ever tell me.

43:58.057 --> 44:04.050
Not mom or dad or even Dawnie.
What's die?   What's dead?

44:04.751 --> 44:10.007
- Do they mean the same thing?
- In a way.

44:14.353 --> 44:18.752
You see, every moment
of the day and night,

44:18.753 --> 44:22.216
your heart is beating
inside your chest,

44:22.817 --> 44:24.775
like it is now.

44:26.379 --> 44:28.842
- You can almost feel it, can't you?
- Hmm.

44:29.414 --> 44:32.478
Well, when that
does that, you're alive.

44:34.272 --> 44:38.678
Now you've seen things grow old and
wear out, things that you've used.

44:39.379 --> 44:45.609
Well, people wear out
and their heart stops.

44:47.596 --> 44:51.677
Like a clock that you
can't wind up anymore.

44:54.398 --> 44:56.552
It happens to everybody.

44:58.191 --> 45:01.827
It just happens one day,
and then you're dead.

45:04.813 --> 45:08.306
It's nothing to be afraid of.
Can't hurt you.

45:12.423 --> 45:15.526
- Is it going to happen to us?
- Yes.

45:18.151 --> 45:20.398
I don't want you
to die before I do.

45:20.763 --> 45:24.077
Tim, dying is like saying
goodbye and going away.

45:24.078 --> 45:26.793
It happens to
every single one of us.

45:29.105 --> 45:33.518
- Dawnie's going away.
- That's different.

45:35.839 --> 45:40.787
She's getting married and
you'll be able to see her.

45:42.594 --> 45:45.586
Don't be unhappy
about it, please.  Promise.

45:48.197 --> 45:50.321
- I promise.
- Good.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.495
- Anyway.
- What?

45:58.593 --> 46:00.572
Just, I don't want you to hug me.

46:00.873 --> 46:05.965
Well, when I was a little kid, when
I cried, mommy used to hug me.

46:06.266 --> 46:10.127
Then when I got bigger, she
didn't hug me again.  But you did.

46:15.270 --> 46:19.673
Well, I just mad at
how people are, that's it.

46:23.992 --> 46:25.578
I like you.

46:26.079 --> 46:28.813
I like you the same as
I like my mom and dad.

46:29.314 --> 46:32.427
- I don't like Dawnie as much as I like you.
- Oh now, Tim.

46:32.428 --> 46:34.519
No, I like you
better than I like Dawnie.

46:36.520 --> 46:39.829
I like you too, Tim.
Very much.

46:40.430 --> 46:43.114
As much you like
your own mom and dad?

46:43.115 --> 46:46.836
I don't have a mom and dad.
They died a long time ago.

47:11.234 --> 47:12.697
Plush looking place isn't it?

47:12.698 --> 47:15.239
We're only gonna have a
drink with the Harringtons.

47:15.240 --> 47:17.475
We're not going to buy the place.

47:26.776 --> 47:29.017
Well, here we are.

47:29.218 --> 47:30.901
Here you are.

47:32.102 --> 47:34.223
Emily, Ron.

47:34.224 --> 47:36.231
I'd like you to meet my
mother and my father.

47:36.232 --> 47:37.863
Dick and Vivian.

47:37.864 --> 47:40.682
- How do you do?
- How are you?

47:40.683 --> 47:43.991
- This, of course, is Dawnie.
- Ah, yes.

47:44.192 --> 47:47.573
Well, let's drink a toast to
the bride and groom, heh?

47:47.674 --> 47:51.993
Long life and happy days.

47:51.994 --> 47:53.719
- Cheers.
- Make a doney.

47:53.720 --> 47:56.116
- Thanks.
- To us.

47:57.540 --> 48:00.572
- Well, shall we sit down?
- Yes.

48:14.336 --> 48:18.520
Naturally adorable, American white.
With at least one attendant?

48:18.521 --> 48:22.241
- One.  Well, she's gonna have four.
- Ooh.

48:22.642 --> 48:28.577
- And the man in morning suit, Mr Melville?
- Ron.

48:29.178 --> 48:35.237
- What do you think, Mr Ron?
- Well, whatever you say.

48:41.529 --> 48:46.049
I'll give you a full list of all those the
groom would want invited Mrs Melville.

48:46.050 --> 48:53.139
- Oh, call me Em, Emily.
- Oh yes, well.  Emily.

48:53.140 --> 48:56.574
Sure, whatever you think.

48:56.575 --> 49:00.686
- I believe that Dawn has a brother.
- Yeah.

49:00.687 --> 49:04.088
That's Tim.  But he won't
be coming to the wedding.

49:04.389 --> 49:07.736
Dad, I want Tim to
see me get married.

49:07.837 --> 49:11.134
But Dawnie, you know
Tim don't like crowds.

49:11.235 --> 49:12.933
Dawnie, your dad's right.

49:13.334 --> 49:16.760
You know what Tim is with a lot
of people.  He gets over excited.

49:16.761 --> 49:19.812
I didn't realise that Tim
was a mere youngster.

49:19.813 --> 49:23.032
Oh, he's not.  He's only a year
younger than me, but he's simple.

49:23.433 --> 49:24.919
Simple.

49:25.020 --> 49:28.137
Yeah, well you see.
Tim is not the full quid.

49:30.555 --> 49:32.439
Well, you know that, Mick?

49:32.440 --> 49:36.210
Yeah, well I didn't really
give it much thought.

49:36.611 --> 49:39.087
Well, we've never
tried to hide it, have we?

49:39.088 --> 49:40.828
Well, no.

49:43.690 --> 49:46.956
Anyway, Tim's my
brother and I love him

49:46.957 --> 49:49.680
and he's coming to my
wedding, and that's that.

49:55.012 --> 49:57.209
More champagne?

50:18.310 --> 50:19.648
Damn.

50:22.314 --> 50:24.418
3094208.

50:24.419 --> 50:27.054
<i>Hey, hello Ms Morton,
it's me Ron Melville.</i>

50:27.055 --> 50:28.812
Oh, how are you, Mr Melville?

50:28.813 --> 50:30.623
<i>I'm fine thank you.</i>

50:30.624 --> 50:35.912
Sorry to be ringing you at home.  But
Em and I need your advise on something.

50:35.913 --> 50:37.109
Yes.

50:37.310 --> 50:39.860
Our daughter
Dawnie is getting married.

50:39.861 --> 50:41.876
<i>Oh, yes I know.
Congratulations.</i>

50:42.077 --> 50:44.794
Yes, oh thank you.
It's about the wedding.

50:44.795 --> 50:48.520
I'm giving her a big one.
Four bridesmaid sort, you know.

50:48.721 --> 50:54.190
And, well, Em and I would
like Tim at the wedding.

50:54.291 --> 50:58.774
<i>But then there's a reception
afterwards you see, with all those people,</i>

50:58.975 --> 51:01.791
and Em and I, well, we
don't think he should go.

51:01.792 --> 51:03.341
We don't think he could handle it.

51:03.629 --> 51:07.213
Listen, why don't you
let him go to the church,

51:07.514 --> 51:11.090
and then I'll pick him up
outside right afterwards

51:11.091 --> 51:14.172
and he can go to my beach place
and stay for the weekend.

51:14.173 --> 51:17.148
Well, thanks Ms Horton.
Thanks very much.

51:17.149 --> 51:19.093
- Goodnight.
- Goodbye.

51:21.284 --> 51:22.722
- Alright?
- Umm.

51:23.719 --> 51:27.329
They kneel before Thee now
with the love pure and whole

51:27.330 --> 51:30.199
to ask Thy blessing
on their lives together.

51:30.300 --> 51:33.424
May the light of Thy
wisdom be above them

51:33.425 --> 51:36.323
and Thy love be
their strength and stay

51:36.324 --> 51:39.292
and the spirit of
Christ be their spirit.

51:39.393 --> 51:41.138
- Amen.
- Amen.

51:41.139 --> 51:43.683
Now may God may hold
grace to abandon you

51:43.684 --> 51:46.371
that ye may abound
onto every good work

51:46.472 --> 51:48.945
and that through
the proving of your faith

51:48.946 --> 51:51.141
men may glorify God.

51:51.342 --> 51:53.728
- Amen.
- Amen.

51:55.215 --> 51:58.081
Dawnie looks like a fairy
princess, doesn't she?

52:00.011 --> 52:02.984
You be sure and wait outside
for Ms Horton, like I told you, huh?

52:02.985 --> 52:04.147
Mmm.

52:04.348 --> 52:07.246
- See you back home tomorrow, my son.
- Right on, dad.

52:22.652 --> 52:24.224
But how was the wedding?

52:24.525 --> 52:27.092
- Were you happy for Dawnie?
- Yeah.

52:27.093 --> 52:29.277
Mom cried a bit, so did dad.

52:30.115 --> 52:33.955
I don't know.   I don't see why
you should cry if you're happy.

52:35.923 --> 52:38.939
Someday, I hope you're
so happy that you'll cry.

52:59.613 --> 53:00.988
How is it going?

53:06.377 --> 53:07.678
It's good.

54:35.239 --> 54:36.832
Fine night, Mary.

54:38.137 --> 54:39.646
Goodnight, Tim.

54:51.474 --> 54:52.656
Thanks.

54:56.571 --> 54:58.814
- You have a copy of this telex?
- Yes.

54:59.215 --> 55:01.693
Problem not this far from solved.

55:06.741 --> 55:09.154
I haven't seen you today.
You had a good weekend?

55:10.010 --> 55:12.834
- Went down to the beach.
- You and Tim?

55:13.335 --> 55:16.408
- Yes.
- Yeah.  Had been quite a twosome.

55:16.909 --> 55:20.342
- Yes.
- They need a decision right away.

55:23.153 --> 55:24.619
I went out the last time.

55:24.820 --> 55:27.813
I think both of us are
gonna have to go this time.

55:28.314 --> 55:32.664
Tomorrow morning.  I'll pick you
up in a cab.   Plane leaves at 7.

56:02.134 --> 56:03.404
Hi mom!

56:03.423 --> 56:08.062
Hah!  Have some
fresh cards for you.

56:11.803 --> 56:13.850
- Ms Horton?
- Mmm.

56:15.149 --> 56:22.868
- What she say?
- I ... I'm ...

56:26.072 --> 56:28.989
Be back Saturday.

56:32.972 --> 56:35.422
You miss her, don't you?

56:46.612 --> 56:50.555
- I got it, ma’am.
- Oh, thanks son.

57:16.131 --> 57:18.717
- I have to make a phone call.
- I'll get the bags.

57:36.688 --> 57:39.272
Tim, I'm back.

58:23.482 --> 58:29.433
<i>Fental cantinorirum tepatolin anticulate
degeneration were just so many words to me.</i>

58:29.734 --> 58:32.280
<i>I was a primary school teacher.</i>

58:32.481 --> 58:37.349
<i>I decided to go to England on
a sabbatical about 8 years ago.</i>

58:37.450 --> 58:41.075
<i>And while there, quite
accidentally, somehow</i>

58:41.076 --> 58:44.877
<i>I got drafted into a school for
mentally retarded youngsters.</i>

58:44.978 --> 58:47.770
<i>It fascinated me from the very beginning.</i>

58:48.271 --> 58:53.931
<i>When I returned, I decided that,
that was the work I wanted to do.</i>

58:53.932 --> 58:58.306
<i>So I went back to school myself
to learn how to teach the children.</i>

59:01.106 --> 59:03.777
<i>Youngsters are taught
many things of course,</i>

59:03.778 --> 59:05.600
<i>more than just
how to read and write.</i>

59:06.001 --> 59:10.090
<i>What's happening out there is a part of
the work of the creative leisure movement.</i>

59:10.191 --> 59:13.501
<i>They have been rehearsing
a play for a week now.</i>

59:13.602 --> 59:16.195
<i>A very special kind of play.</i>

59:16.496 --> 59:18.757
They've written it themselves.
They've directed it.

59:18.758 --> 59:22.283
They're playing all the parts.
They've made everything for it.

59:22.284 --> 59:24.692
All the costumes
and the bits and pieces.

59:24.993 --> 59:27.913
But the main thing,
is that it's their play.

59:28.014 --> 59:30.597
They're the ones
who've made it happen.

59:36.407 --> 59:38.958
You say you taught Tim to read?

59:39.159 --> 59:40.527
Yes, a little.

59:40.528 --> 59:42.160
And he was pleased about that?

59:42.161 --> 59:45.769
Oh yes.   He felt that he had
achieved something very important.

59:46.170 --> 59:50.825
He's aware of his limits.
Incredible.

59:51.226 --> 59:56.270
But you see, I'm not
sure of what his limits are.

59:56.271 --> 59:59.040
I want to so know
what he's really thinking,

59:59.231 --> 01:00:03.610
what he's feeling,
how he dreams.

01:00:05.088 --> 01:00:07.380
The children will be going
back into school now.

01:00:07.381 --> 01:00:09.253
Would you like to see
the rest of the school?

01:00:09.254 --> 01:00:10.946
Oh, I'd like very much to.

01:00:15.773 --> 01:00:19.777
- What does Tim do for a living?
- He's a labourer. A builder's labourer.

01:00:19.878 --> 01:00:21.614
What are his
mother and father like?

01:00:21.615 --> 01:00:24.902
I've never actually met them.  I've
only spoken to them on the phone.

01:00:26.221 --> 01:00:31.901
I'm sure they're not well educated.
They love him a lot.

01:00:33.192 --> 01:00:35.711
They didn't know what to do
with him when he was a child.

01:00:35.812 --> 01:00:40.506
When he couldn't manage at
school, they sent him off to work.

01:00:41.007 --> 01:00:43.034
I'd pretty like to
meet Tim some time.

01:00:43.035 --> 01:00:44.860
I'd think he'd like to meet you.

01:00:44.861 --> 01:00:48.411
What's he like?  Any speech
abnormality, any physical deformity?

01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:52.278
No.
He's quite handsome, actually.

01:02:30.145 --> 01:02:34.188
- Well, where mommy?
- Em, we're home.  Em?

01:02:34.704 --> 01:02:36.707
She must have go lie down.

01:02:38.402 --> 01:02:39.659
Mom?

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:52.499
Dad!  In here dad!
Dad!

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.931
Oh Jesus!
Oh Jesus Christ.

01:03:02.348 --> 01:03:08.007
She's as cold as ice.  Get a
cardigan, a blanket or something.

01:03:18.906 --> 01:03:21.773
Hello, Dr Perkins,
it's Ron Melville here.

01:03:21.874 --> 01:03:26.732
Doctor Tim, I think it's her heart.
But she's just lying here.

01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:31.334
Alright, we'll wait for him.

01:03:31.995 --> 01:03:36.413
Em, it's me, Ron.
Can you hear me?

01:03:36.514 --> 01:03:42.628
Em!  Em it's Ron.
Can you hear me?

01:03:49.912 --> 01:03:56.040
Oh Ron, I'm so pleased to see you.

01:03:56.241 --> 01:03:58.476
Thanks to yer.

01:04:00.177 --> 01:04:04.230
- Where's Tim?
- He's here, love.

01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:05.731
Mom, I'm here, mom.

01:04:07.746 --> 01:04:12.828
Don't worry.  The ambulance is
coming to take you to the hospital.

01:04:15.448 --> 01:04:17.060
How do you feel?

01:04:19.091 --> 01:04:23.387
Like something that can't ....

01:04:25.049 --> 01:04:31.626
Oh Ron, I wet the ....
chair or something.

01:04:32.787 --> 01:04:34.690
Back of a purpose chair.

01:04:37.216 --> 01:04:41.691
Oh Em, don't let anything
happen to you love.

01:04:42.192 --> 01:04:45.582
Hold on till we get
you to the hospital.

01:05:07.514 --> 01:05:11.667
- Ron.
- I'm here, love.

01:05:12.468 --> 01:05:15.927
We're at the hospital.
Soon have you fixed up.

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:25.029
- Ron.
- Yes, love.

01:05:27.331 --> 01:05:31.234
Take good care of Tim.

01:05:35.402 --> 01:05:39.450
Best thing for Tim.

01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:33.554
Dad ... dad!

01:06:37.939 --> 01:06:42.211
- Is she alright?
- We got her here in time.

01:06:42.312 --> 01:06:44.730
She's gonna be alright.

01:06:44.931 --> 01:06:46.770
Come on Dawnie, sit down.

01:06:48.327 --> 01:06:51.984
Take it easy.
You, okay?

01:06:53.285 --> 01:06:55.355
Sorry, pop.

01:06:59.884 --> 01:07:01.791
Why did I go to the pub?

01:07:03.609 --> 01:07:06.928
Could have come straight home.   I
could have come straight home for once.

01:07:08.674 --> 01:07:14.494
- Don't blame yourself, dad.
- But I do.

01:07:23.012 --> 01:07:31.682
Tim, don't worry about mom.
She's going to be alright.

01:07:33.909 --> 01:07:36.231
But what if mom dies, Dawnie?

01:07:38.316 --> 01:07:43.813
Mary told me about dying.
What if mom dies?

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:08.469
Talk to you a moment, Ron.

01:08:23.698 --> 01:08:27.294
She's gone, mate.
We did all we could.

01:08:32.604 --> 01:08:34.095
Gone?

01:08:35.796 --> 01:08:38.309
How am I going
to tell Dawnie and Tim?

01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:40.487
Do you want me to?

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.935
Could I see her?

01:09:49.814 --> 01:09:54.811
- She's gone.
- Oh, Mick!

01:09:58.825 --> 01:10:01.641
- Mick, you let Dawnie help me.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:10:05.153 --> 01:10:06.912
Come on, son.

01:10:10.946 --> 01:10:14.052
- We go for a walk, huh?
- Uh mm.

01:10:49.313 --> 01:10:55.342
Well, she's gone Tim.  We got to
learn to get along without her.

01:10:57.645 --> 01:11:00.093
But it's gonna be awful hard.

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:10.457
Is she really and truly dead?

01:11:12.416 --> 01:11:16.876
Yes, son.
Really and truly.

01:11:37.005 --> 01:11:41.091
Mary told me about dying.
I know what dead is.

01:11:42.302 --> 01:11:46.954
It's just like saying goodbye
and going away, isn't it?

01:11:49.202 --> 01:11:56.517
That's about the size of it, son ...
except we never got to say goodbye.

01:12:30.515 --> 01:12:34.771
- Mary Horton.
- Ms Horton.  It's Ron Melville here.

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:40.895
Sorry to ring you here at your office.
But my wife Em died last night.

01:12:42.994 --> 01:12:46.529
Well, the early hours of this morning.
Really it was very sudden.

01:12:47.726 --> 01:12:52.418
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

01:12:53.252 --> 01:12:55.628
<i>Ms Horton, I know
you're real fond of Tim.</i>

01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:58.284
<i>But I was wondering,</i>

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:05.766
Emma's being buried tomorrow but
I don't think he ought to be there.

01:13:06.067 --> 01:13:09.943
<i>I'll come over as soon as I can.
I'll take him down to the beach.</i>

01:13:09.944 --> 01:13:12.401
Thanks, Ms Horton,
I appreciate that.

01:13:13.969 --> 01:13:17.589
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

01:14:03.451 --> 01:14:04.879
I'll get it.

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:14.349
- Yes.
- I'm Mary Horton.

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:17.072
Could you please tell
Mr Melville that I'm here?

01:14:17.273 --> 01:14:20.251
Oh, yes, sure.

01:14:29.091 --> 01:14:32.881
- Someone for you, Ron.
- Oh.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:48.410
- Oh, Ms Horton?
- Yes, how's Tim?

01:14:49.133 --> 01:14:52.411
Oh, he's taking it
all right, I suppose.

01:14:52.412 --> 01:14:55.687
Sorry, I rang you at your office
but I didn't know what else to do.

01:14:55.688 --> 01:14:57.128
I'll take him down to the beach.

01:14:57.129 --> 01:15:00.276
Perhaps on Sunday you could
come down, stay for a while.

01:15:00.277 --> 01:15:04.207
I just might take you up on that.
Come on inside.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:18.452
- And this is Ms Horton, Tim's friend.
- Hello, Mary.

01:15:18.653 --> 01:15:20.791
We're going down to my beach place.

01:15:21.092 --> 01:15:24.060
- Hello Dawnie.
- Hell are you doing here?

01:15:24.461 --> 01:15:27.041
- I've come for Tim.
- I can see that.

01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:29.281
I wouldn't be surprised if you've
been having rough with him too.

01:15:29.282 --> 01:15:31.250
- For Christ's sake Dawnie ...
- Dad, would you shut up.

01:15:31.251 --> 01:15:32.851
It's between me and her.

01:15:32.952 --> 01:15:36.217
Why couldn't you find yourself
a man instead of my brother?

01:15:36.218 --> 01:15:38.240
What in God's name has got into you?

01:15:38.241 --> 01:15:39.841
You keep out of it, Dad.

01:15:39.842 --> 01:15:43.822
Like him doing your garden,
you'd be doing his ...

01:15:49.432 --> 01:15:51.311
Well, you must have realised
what people are thinking,

01:15:51.312 --> 01:15:55.140
I mean, a middle aged woman
with a young man, well.

01:15:55.141 --> 01:15:59.941
You bloody creep, you
miserable puffed up bastard.

01:15:59.942 --> 01:16:01.963
- I ought to knock your teeth in.
- Just hang on Ron.

01:16:01.964 --> 01:16:04.482
You just watch it, Mick.
You take it easy, dad.

01:16:04.483 --> 01:16:05.901
You don't let him get to you.

01:16:06.702 --> 01:16:10.412
I don't know what's going on here.
Can I go and pack my bag now?

01:16:10.713 --> 01:16:12.504
You do that, son.

01:16:13.191 --> 01:16:19.952
- Hey, you're a beaut boy.
- You're alright too dad.

01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:29.498
You're very, very wrong, my dear.

01:16:29.899 --> 01:16:31.623
I'll show you out.

01:16:45.198 --> 01:16:47.388
Don't you take no
notice of them, Ms Horton.

01:16:47.989 --> 01:16:50.133
The only one who
matters now is Tim.

01:16:51.134 --> 01:16:54.944
The last thing Em said was
do the best thing for Tim,

01:16:54.945 --> 01:17:00.152
and I've got to do that because
she ain't here anymore.

01:17:02.169 --> 01:17:04.905
Em and me had some
bloody good years together

01:17:05.206 --> 01:17:08.043
and I'm going to
remember every one of them.

01:17:08.144 --> 01:17:12.241
Maybe Dawnie and Mick
wouldn't understand but uh ...

01:17:12.242 --> 01:17:14.086
mom would be real disappointed

01:17:14.087 --> 01:17:17.488
if I didn't raise a glass or
two every night at the pub.

01:17:17.489 --> 01:17:19.122
You know what I mean?

01:17:21.454 --> 01:17:22.833
Thanks.

01:17:24.212 --> 01:17:25.561
I'm ready.

01:17:27.273 --> 01:17:28.552
Yes, Tim.

01:17:32.782 --> 01:17:34.687
Well, off you go.

01:17:34.688 --> 01:17:36.248
- Bye, dad.
- Bye.

01:18:06.934 --> 01:18:08.883
What's the matter with you, Mary?
Are you laughing or crying?

01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:10.677
Well, I don't know.

01:19:38.471 --> 01:19:39.415
Eternal God

01:19:39.416 --> 01:19:42.825
It has come to think and keeping
there is shelter from the storm.

01:19:42.926 --> 01:19:46.937
And in whose mercy and pity
there is shadow from the heat of life.

01:19:47.338 --> 01:19:51.595
Hear now our prayer we pray Thee
for those who are mourning their dead.

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:54.819
Send Thy pity to
lighten their darkness.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:59.011
In the sense of Thy presence and
sympathy to fill their loneliness.

01:19:59.512 --> 01:20:02.359
Touch their wounds
with Thy hands of healing,

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:07.111
and help them to be still.
Amen.

01:20:22.899 --> 01:20:24.008
Oh, hello, Mary.

01:20:24.009 --> 01:20:25.581
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:20:25.882 --> 01:20:27.761
You're up mighty early?

01:20:27.762 --> 01:20:30.030
Oh, I'm a working lady.
I have to get back to town.

01:20:30.131 --> 01:20:32.805
- Tim knows where everything is.
- We'll be fine.

01:20:34.843 --> 01:20:36.875
- Good morning.
- Where are you going, Mary?

01:20:36.876 --> 01:20:39.876
- The office.
- When will you be back? Tonight?

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:43.174
- No.  The weekend.
- Oh.

01:20:43.175 --> 01:20:45.348
- I'll see you both, Friday.
- Goodbye.

01:21:02.683 --> 01:21:05.186
- Take good care of your dad.
- Oh, I will.

01:21:05.287 --> 01:21:07.820
- I'll call you tonight.
- Promise.

01:21:20.468 --> 01:21:22.342
Thank God, it's
the end of this week.

01:21:25.863 --> 01:21:27.764
Would you like another drink?

01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:30.087
I wouldn't mind.

01:21:36.088 --> 01:21:40.075
You didn't really tell me what happened
after you picked Tim up last week.

01:21:40.576 --> 01:21:42.155
Oh, nothing really.

01:21:42.456 --> 01:21:47.307
- Oh, come on.  Something went on.
- No, really.

01:21:47.808 --> 01:21:49.468
Alright.

01:21:52.004 --> 01:21:54.599
You haven't been
your usual self for a week.

01:21:55.845 --> 01:21:58.636
- Sorry about that.
- Thank you.

01:22:04.518 --> 01:22:12.433
We have known each other,
well, pretty long time, isn't it.

01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:17.459
Do you realise it's been almost 20
years since I came from America?

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.701
And I've never tried to
tell you how to run your life.

01:22:21.302 --> 01:22:22.977
No, you haven't.

01:22:25.462 --> 01:22:28.565
- Do you know what you're about now?
- Haven't I always?

01:22:28.566 --> 01:22:31.363
- That's not what I'm asking you.
- I know.

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.250
It's late Tom.

01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:48.721
Good luck.
It will work out.

01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:53.017
Thanks for the drink and the advice.

01:23:14.496 --> 01:23:15.969
What's up?

01:23:19.242 --> 01:23:22.668
- Oh Mary, I'm glad to see you.
- I thought you'd be in bed by now.

01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:25.715
- Oh, I wouldn't go until you got here.
- He's been waiting up for you.

01:23:30.496 --> 01:23:33.341
I'll go to bed now.
Will you come and say goodnight?

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:35.353
Of course I will.
In a minute.

01:23:37.688 --> 01:23:39.154
Tea's just made.

01:23:43.372 --> 01:23:48.094
- How has it been?
- Good and bad.

01:23:50.147 --> 01:23:52.073
He cried a lot for his mom.

01:23:53.608 --> 01:23:55.617
I'll go say goodnight to him.

01:24:09.714 --> 01:24:12.987
Oh Mary.  I wish you
had been here all this week.

01:24:13.979 --> 01:24:15.695
So do I.

01:24:16.396 --> 01:24:19.615
It's sad to remember that
mom isn't here anymore.

01:24:22.081 --> 01:24:26.559
It was awful not having you here
to talk to.   I'm glad you're back.

01:24:26.901 --> 01:24:28.306
So am I.

01:24:30.762 --> 01:24:34.203
- Goodnight Mary.
- Goodnight.

01:25:17.426 --> 01:25:20.041
It ain't the same
without the old girl.

01:25:25.751 --> 01:25:31.183
If anything should happen to
me, would you look after Tim?

01:25:33.326 --> 01:25:35.037
Of course, I will.

01:25:49.535 --> 01:25:51.609
He's enough to break a man's heart.

01:25:52.877 --> 01:25:55.443
I don't know what's
happening with him and me.

01:25:55.444 --> 01:25:58.454
I don't seem to be able
to talk to him anymore.

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:11.791
- I don't want to interrupt your reading.
- It's alright.

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:14.188
But I thought you
might look at this.

01:26:19.568 --> 01:26:21.508
It's all the stuff I
was telling you about,

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:25.339
the will, bank books,
insurance policies.

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:32.009
All the things Em and me put a few bob
into over the years to make Tim secure.

01:26:32.410 --> 01:26:35.185
I thought you might
look after them for me.

01:26:40.959 --> 01:26:45.492
You see, Mary, I'm dying.

01:26:47.914 --> 01:26:53.056
Or put it this way,
I don't want to live.

01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:57.742
I just can't make myself
want to live anymore.

01:26:59.845 --> 01:27:02.677
I'm not undead like
a clockwork monkey.

01:27:04.738 --> 01:27:07.683
Running down and there's
nothing I can do about it.

01:27:10.159 --> 01:27:14.559
And I'm glad.
I'm glad.

01:27:15.465 --> 01:27:20.628
If I'd been a young man, I might not
have felt the going as bad as this.

01:27:21.329 --> 01:27:23.660
But age makes the difference.

01:27:26.585 --> 01:27:30.012
She's left a great big hole
I can't fill with anything,

01:27:30.513 --> 01:27:32.597
not even Tim.

01:27:35.086 --> 01:27:40.300
All I want now, is to lie
with her under the ground.

01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:54.343
That's right.  Hug him.
You're always doing that.

01:27:54.344 --> 01:27:56.407
What the hell is wrong with him?

01:27:58.461 --> 01:28:00.217
Let me talk to him.

01:28:09.753 --> 01:28:10.819
Tim!

01:28:16.042 --> 01:28:17.120
Tim!

01:28:21.695 --> 01:28:22.791
Tim!

01:29:05.017 --> 01:29:08.652
- What have I done?
- Nothing.  Go away.

01:29:11.532 --> 01:29:13.351
Don't touch me!
Don't!

01:29:15.203 --> 01:29:18.192
Please tell me.  What have
I done, Tim?  You must tell me.

01:29:18.193 --> 01:29:19.396
Nothing.

01:29:20.197 --> 01:29:22.476
Tell me what's the matter, please.

01:29:23.954 --> 01:29:26.438
- I can't.
- You can.

01:29:26.439 --> 01:29:28.339
You've always been
able to tell me everything.

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:31.238
I can't.  I can't.
I don't know.

01:29:37.563 --> 01:29:40.149
I only know you don't
like me anymore, that's all.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:42.907
You like dad better
than you like me now.

01:29:44.691 --> 01:29:47.715
Ever since you met him,
you haven't liked me and I knew it.

01:29:48.316 --> 01:29:54.091
Oh Tim, how can I
ever stop liking you?

01:29:54.092 --> 01:29:55.596
You did when you met dad.

01:29:59.095 --> 01:30:07.090
Oh, that's not true Tim.
Oh, please, believe me that's not true.

01:30:07.091 --> 01:30:12.875
I like your dad, but I could
never like him as much as I like you.

01:30:12.876 --> 01:30:15.967
You don't like me anymore.
It's him you like now.

01:30:16.368 --> 01:30:20.453
I've seen you hugging him all the
time and I want you to hug me,

01:30:20.554 --> 01:30:24.637
but you don't.
But you do it to him.

01:30:29.052 --> 01:30:34.544
Tim, I know that you
miss your mom a lot,

01:30:35.845 --> 01:30:39.621
but it's not in the same
way that your dad does.

01:30:40.904 --> 01:30:48.312
You know, you're
young and he's old.

01:30:52.186 --> 01:30:53.847
I know how dad feels.

01:30:56.955 --> 01:30:59.531
He wants to die, so
he can lie next to mom.

01:31:02.581 --> 01:31:04.561
He just wants to be with her.

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.553
He misses her terribly.

01:31:10.738 --> 01:31:14.016
He misses her like
I'll miss you if you died.

01:31:20.599 --> 01:31:21.953
Mary.

01:32:42.672 --> 01:32:44.021
Dear God!

01:32:46.487 --> 01:32:47.693
What's wrong?

01:32:57.865 --> 01:32:59.128
Let's go back.

01:33:03.898 --> 01:33:06.983
Johnny, help me please.
I don't know what to do.

01:33:07.777 --> 01:33:09.855
I feel so guilty.

01:33:12.930 --> 01:33:17.403
When we're together,
I see him looking at me ...

01:33:17.504 --> 01:33:19.660
with such confusion.

01:33:20.891 --> 01:33:24.187
He trusts me and I'm hurting him.

01:33:24.188 --> 01:33:27.912
- And I promised his father ...
- Have you come up with a solution?

01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:31.588
Only not seeing him again.

01:33:35.690 --> 01:33:37.272
But I can't do that.

01:33:37.373 --> 01:33:40.856
- There is another way, you know?
- What?

01:33:42.573 --> 01:33:44.985
Why don't you marry him?

01:33:45.202 --> 01:33:49.067
- It's crazy.
- Is it?  Is it really?

01:33:51.435 --> 01:33:56.009
- John, that really is crazy.
- Why not marry him?

01:33:57.822 --> 01:33:59.856
It's frightening.

01:34:00.707 --> 01:34:03.576
For some reason, out of
all the people he's known,

01:34:03.677 --> 01:34:08.490
Tim has fixed his affection on you.
And with you it will stay.

01:34:10.991 --> 01:34:15.095
Stopped thinking of myself
as being married for so long.

01:34:15.555 --> 01:34:18.451
Mary, what do you really want?

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:21.583
Do you want Tim to live the
rest of his life on his own

01:34:21.584 --> 01:34:23.136
while you sit there is your house

01:34:23.137 --> 01:34:25.796
wishing you had the guts
to do something about him?

01:34:27.067 --> 01:34:30.836
You can't walk away from
him now, Mary.  You know that.

01:34:33.756 --> 01:34:39.868
Tim loves you.   With every
part of his being, he loves you.

01:34:45.341 --> 01:34:50.139
- Will you come to my wedding?
- I'll even dance at yours.

01:34:54.710 --> 01:34:57.595
I may speak in tongues
of men or of angels.

01:34:57.796 --> 01:35:02.617
If I am without love, I have a
sounding gong or a clanging cymbal.

01:35:02.718 --> 01:35:06.518
I may have faith, strong
enough to move mountains.

01:35:06.519 --> 01:35:09.254
If I have no love, I have nothing.

01:35:09.555 --> 01:35:13.635
Love is patient.
Love is kind and envies no one.

01:35:13.836 --> 01:35:18.017
Love is never boastful
nor conceited nor rude.

01:35:18.118 --> 01:35:21.627
Never selfish,
not quick to take offense.

01:35:23.078 --> 01:35:27.507
Love keeps no score of wrongs
but delights in the truth.

01:35:28.008 --> 01:35:30.694
There is nothing love cannot face.

01:35:30.695 --> 01:35:35.696
There is no limit to its faith,
its hope and its endurance.

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:38.564
Love will never come to an end.

01:35:38.565 --> 01:35:42.035
In a word, there are
3 things that last forever.

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:44.868
Faith, hope and love.

01:35:45.069 --> 01:35:48.358
But the greatest of them is love.

01:35:51.091 --> 01:35:58.239
Do you, Tim Melville, take Mary Horton
as your lawful wedded wife?

01:35:58.240 --> 01:35:59.752
I do.

01:36:00.153 --> 01:36:06.660
Do you, Mary Horton, take Tim Melville
as your lawful wedded husband?

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:08.798
I do.

01:36:10.654 --> 01:36:15.021
I now pronounce you,
man and wife.

01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:52.822
What is it?

01:41:57.676 --> 01:42:01.729
You told me that one day
I'd be so happy that I'd cry.

01:42:04.287 --> 01:42:06.625
Oh, I so love you.

01:43:04.767 --> 01:43:06.859
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:12.889
<i>This is Fred Kelman speaking.
Is Mr Melville in?  I mean is Tim in?</i>

01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:14.765
Ah. This is Mrs Melville.

01:43:14.766 --> 01:43:18.020
<i>I'm sorry to disturb you
Mrs Melville, to ring you like this.</i>

01:43:18.021 --> 01:43:20.464
<i>But my wife and I are
neighbours of Ron Melville.</i>

01:43:20.565 --> 01:43:24.665
<i>We hadn't seen him about his
place for the past few days so</i>

01:43:24.666 --> 01:43:27.680
<i>this morning I went
across to knock at his door ...</i>

01:43:36.251 --> 01:43:39.616
<i>Could you come up right away and
make the necessary arrangements?</i>

01:43:41.766 --> 01:43:48.948
Yes.
We'll be there.

01:43:58.105 --> 01:44:01.892
Oh Lord, support us all the
day long of this troublest life

01:44:02.093 --> 01:44:04.923
until the shadows lengthen
and the evening comes.

01:44:05.224 --> 01:44:09.078
And the fever of life is
over and Thy work is done.

01:44:09.579 --> 01:44:12.847
Then in Thy great mercy
grant us a safe lodging

01:44:12.848 --> 01:44:16.648
and a holy rest
and peace at the last.

01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:18.993
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:44:19.094 --> 01:44:20.761
Lord, bless us and keep us.

01:44:20.762 --> 01:44:24.605
The Lord make his face to shine
upon us and be gracious unto us.

01:44:24.806 --> 01:44:27.611
The Lord lift up the lives of
his countenance upon us

01:44:27.912 --> 01:44:29.709
and give us peace.

01:44:29.710 --> 01:44:31.784
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:44:33.263 --> 01:44:35.791
My condolences on your loss.

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:40.472
Dawnie, I'm so sorry.

01:44:40.573 --> 01:44:44.135
Don't talk to me.  You've got
what you wanted.  You've got Tim.

01:44:45.629 --> 01:44:49.325
Tim, my condolences to you.

01:45:06.377 --> 01:45:08.870
Dawnie, look what you've done.

01:45:09.271 --> 01:45:11.145
Dawnie, you're done.

01:45:11.146 --> 01:45:13.013
I never want to
see that woman again.

01:45:13.214 --> 01:45:14.553
Don't say that, Dawnie.

01:45:14.554 --> 01:45:17.239
Look, I feel sorry for you.
I really do, Tim, but ...

01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:20.931
- What is different?
- What's different?

01:45:20.932 --> 01:45:22.817
Me.
I'm different.

01:45:23.465 --> 01:45:27.170
I'm married.  Mary is my wife.
Just like you're Mick's wife.

01:45:27.858 --> 01:45:31.622
All I know is mom and dad's in
their graves and you're with her.

01:45:35.321 --> 01:45:39.134
I just want things to be
the way they used to.

01:45:39.135 --> 01:45:44.653
I want you to love Mary.
I love you Dawnie, please.

01:45:45.254 --> 01:45:47.710
Oh, Tim.

01:45:52.595 --> 01:45:54.832
Everything's gonna be alright?

01:45:56.140 --> 01:46:00.362
Yeah, of course it is.

01:46:07.571 --> 01:46:13.378
Come on love.
See you later, Tim, Mary.  Bye.
