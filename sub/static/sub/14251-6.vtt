WEBVTT

00:04.371 --> 00:06.134
lt's not as difficult
as it looks.

00:06.206 --> 00:07.605
The first rule is:

00:07.674 --> 00:09.266
Don't be afraid of the clay.

00:09.342 --> 00:10.809
l fear nothing.

00:10.877 --> 00:12.435
l mean you can't
concern yourself

00:12.512 --> 00:13.536
with making a mistake,

00:13.613 --> 00:15.308
or whether the image
you had in your mind

00:15.382 --> 00:16.974
is what's taking form
in front of you.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.540
You just have
to let your hands--

00:18.618 --> 00:20.745
and the clay-- do the work.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.811
Here.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.995
Go ahead.

00:29.062 --> 00:30.996
l think the nose could be
a little stronger.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.507 --> 00:41.997
Well, that's a start.

00:42.075 --> 00:43.042
Keep going.

00:53.853 --> 00:56.583
This activity
is truly unproductive.

00:56.656 --> 00:59.022
The end result has no use.

00:59.092 --> 01:01.458
No necessary task has been
accomplished.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.262
Time has been expended,
nothing more.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.822
That depends on how you
look at it, doesn't it?

01:07.901 --> 01:11.735
l find sculpting
helps me unwind, relax.

01:11.805 --> 01:12.931
The concept of relaxation

01:13.039 --> 01:15.701
is difficult for me
to understand.

01:15.775 --> 01:19.438
As a Borg, my time was spent
working at a specific task.

01:19.512 --> 01:21.605
When it was completed,
l was assigned another.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.308
lt was efficient.

01:23.383 --> 01:24.645
Well, so is this.

01:24.717 --> 01:27.208
lt helps my own efficiency

01:27.287 --> 01:29.619
to forget about Voyager
for awhile.

01:33.226 --> 01:35.990
l'd be embarrassed
to show Maestro Leonardo

01:36.062 --> 01:38.292
something like this, but...

01:38.364 --> 01:42.733
l get a great deal of pleasure
in working the clay...

01:42.802 --> 01:45.771
in creating something.

01:45.839 --> 01:49.741
But why here, in this simulation
among these archaic objects

01:49.809 --> 01:51.902
and this disorganized
environment?

01:51.978 --> 01:54.674
Frankly, it's refreshing
to take myself

01:54.747 --> 01:57.739
out of the 24th century
every now and then.

01:57.817 --> 02:00.377
And a little disorganization

02:00.453 --> 02:04.719
can be very encouraging
to the imagination.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.691
You might want to try it
sometime.

02:06.759 --> 02:11.389
Are you suggesting that l create
one of these holodeck programs?

02:11.464 --> 02:13.659
You might find it interesting.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.793
lt's a way of exploring
aspects of yourself

02:16.870 --> 02:21.569
that probably didn't fit
into your life as a Borg--

02:21.641 --> 02:22.573
imagination...

02:22.642 --> 02:24.337
creativity...

02:24.410 --> 02:25.638
fantasy...

02:25.712 --> 02:28.442
l am uncertain why these things
are necessary.

02:28.515 --> 02:31.075
Well, they aren't necessary,
Seven,

02:31.151 --> 02:33.642
but they're an important part
of one's life

02:33.720 --> 02:36.120
because imagination
frees the mind,

02:36.189 --> 02:39.124
it inspires ideas and solutions

02:39.192 --> 02:42.650
and it can provide
a great deal of pleasure.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.594
Human progress...

02:44.664 --> 02:46.256
the human mind itself

02:46.332 --> 02:48.425
couldn't exist without them.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.992
When l was a child,
l studied these drawings.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.595
l even built
some of these models.

02:55.241 --> 02:58.210
Da Vinci was always
a great inspiration to me.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.870
He was a very busy man.

02:59.946 --> 03:02.779
Oh, yes, a prolific artist

03:02.882 --> 03:05.476
and a scientist as well.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.986
Far, far ahead of his time.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.025
That design, for example.

03:13.092 --> 03:15.925
He conceived of an airplane

03:15.995 --> 03:19.624
centuries before one
was actually built.

03:19.699 --> 03:20.825
Seven?

03:25.805 --> 03:27.602
You will be assimilated.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.935
Resistance is futile.

03:31.010 --> 03:34.468
Your distinctiveness
will be added to our own.

03:34.547 --> 03:38.347
Annika!

03:38.418 --> 03:41.478
You will be assimilated.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.022
You will be
assimilated.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.330
Seven, what is it?

03:54.100 --> 03:55.795
l don't know.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.215
lt's happened three times now

05:55.288 --> 05:57.688
in different locations,
at different times of the day.

05:57.757 --> 06:02.353
l experience a series
of disjointed images in my mind.

06:02.428 --> 06:04.419
Can you be more specific?

06:04.497 --> 06:06.829
Were these hallucinations?

06:06.899 --> 06:09.299
l don't know.
l've never hallucinated.

06:09.369 --> 06:14.033
lt's as if l were aboard
a Borg vessel, but...

06:14.107 --> 06:17.099
but l was frightened.
l felt fear.

06:19.946 --> 06:21.641
Each experience is similar--

06:21.714 --> 06:23.306
l'm pursued by the Borg.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.146
They want to assimilate me.

06:25.218 --> 06:29.052
l'm...l'm running from them,
and then...

06:29.122 --> 06:31.920
and then, each time,
l see...a bird.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.856
A bird?

06:33.926 --> 06:37.089
Yes, a large, black bird,
flying toward me,

06:37.163 --> 06:38.596
shrieking...

06:38.664 --> 06:40.256
attacking me.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.857
Hmm.

06:41.934 --> 06:44.129
Your hippocampus is
in a state of agitation.

06:44.203 --> 06:45.932
What does that mean?

06:46.005 --> 06:50.374
As your human physiology
continues to reassert itself,

06:50.443 --> 06:52.240
psychological symptoms
are bound to manifest

06:52.311 --> 06:53.642
in a variety of ways--

06:53.713 --> 06:56.443
through dreams, hallucinations,

06:56.516 --> 06:58.484
hypnagogic regression...

06:58.551 --> 07:00.041
Hypnagogic regression?

07:00.119 --> 07:01.381
Flashbacks.

07:01.454 --> 07:03.945
You could be experiencing
some sort of post- traumatic

07:04.023 --> 07:04.955
stress disorder.

07:05.024 --> 07:06.116
That makes sense.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.990
You were assimilated
by the Borg.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.825
You've gone through
an intense, prolonged trauma.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.490
l was not traumatized.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.397
l was raised by the Borg.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.333
l don't see them
as threatening.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.997
Why would l experience fear?

07:20.072 --> 07:21.596
l don't know.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.800
Will l keep having
these flashbacks?

07:24.877 --> 07:27.072
l'll need to study
your neural scans further.

07:27.146 --> 07:28.511
ln the meantime,

07:28.581 --> 07:30.708
your digestive system
is fully functional.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.045
Now is as good a time as any

07:32.118 --> 07:34.678
for you to begin taking
solid and liquid nutrients.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.551
Oral consumption is inefficient.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.386
And unnecessary, if you're lucky
enough to be a hologram.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.859
But your human physiology
requires it.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.590
l'll draw up a list
of nutritional requirements.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.359
Take it to Mr. Neelix
in the Mess Hall.

07:46.432 --> 07:48.423
l hesitate to inflict
his cooking on you,

07:48.501 --> 07:50.628
but it'll have to do.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.600
l do not enjoy this sensation.

07:54.674 --> 07:57.666
Something is happening to me
and l don't know what it is.

07:57.743 --> 08:00.075
lt's as though
l'm being driven somehow.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.545
Chakotay to the Captain.

08:01.614 --> 08:02.638
Go ahead.

08:02.715 --> 08:03.704
Our guests have arrived.

08:03.783 --> 08:05.341
They're being escorted
to the briefing room.

08:05.418 --> 08:06.510
On my way.

08:06.586 --> 08:07.848
Representatives of the B'omar.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.854
l've been trying to negotiate
passage through their space,

08:09.922 --> 08:11.856
but so far, they've been
difficult to deal with.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.858
l hope they've had
a change of heart.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.486
l'll stay here and wait for
the Doctor's instructions.

08:17.597 --> 08:20.065
We'll help you through this,
Seven.

08:20.132 --> 08:22.191
You'll be all right.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.607
Have you had a chance
to consider our request?

08:35.681 --> 08:37.205
Congratulations, Captain.

08:37.283 --> 08:40.013
Against our better judgment,
the B'omar Sovereignty

08:40.086 --> 08:41.917
has agreed to grant
your vessel passage

08:41.988 --> 08:43.352
through our territory.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.913
On behalf of my crew,
thank you.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.925
That will cut three months
off our journey.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.255
However, there are a few

08:49.328 --> 08:52.126
stipulations-- guidelines
that you must adhere to.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.894
You'll have
our complete cooperation.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.060
We expect nothing less.

08:57.136 --> 09:00.628
While in our space, your vessel
will not exceed warp 3

09:00.706 --> 09:02.731
and your weapon systems
will remain off- line.

09:02.808 --> 09:05.072
You will avoid unnecessary scans

09:05.144 --> 09:08.079
and you will not conduct
surveys of any kind.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.411
You will make no attempt
to explore our space,

09:10.483 --> 09:12.314
and you will avoid
all communications

09:12.385 --> 09:13.545
with nonmilitary craft.

09:13.619 --> 09:16.520
We've also plotted the course
your vessel is to follow.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.692
lt'll take us weeks
to follow that course.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.169
lf not months.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.401
We've designed this course
so that your ship would avoid

09:35.474 --> 09:38.136
our populated systems
and industrial areas.

09:38.210 --> 09:42.271
Deviation is not recommended.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.213
There are a total
of 17 checkpoints

09:44.283 --> 09:46.410
where you will submit
your vessel for inspection.

09:46.485 --> 09:49.113
Chancellor Gauman,
if l may interrupt.

09:49.188 --> 09:52.453
l appreciate your efforts
in plotting this flight plan,

09:52.525 --> 09:56.359
but, if we could, l'd like
to negotiate a course

09:56.429 --> 09:58.226
that's a little more...

09:58.297 --> 09:59.764
direct.

10:05.705 --> 10:08.196
Well,
what an unexpected pleasure.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.866
Welcome to the Mess Hall.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.706
Would you like me
to show you around?

10:12.778 --> 10:14.507
My physiology
has reasserted the need

10:14.580 --> 10:16.104
to process solid nutrients.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.878
The Doctor has prepared a list
of dietary requirements.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.316
You will provide them for me.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.878
Let's see what we have here.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.083
250 grams glycoproteins

10:26.158 --> 10:29.218
consisting of 53 percent
polypeptides

10:29.295 --> 10:32.731
and 26 percent
fibrous glycogen...

10:32.798 --> 10:34.095
Ugh!

10:34.166 --> 10:35.895
Doesn't sound very appetizing.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.596
However, a plate
of my chadre kab

10:38.671 --> 10:40.400
should satisfy
most of these essentials,

10:40.473 --> 10:43.567
while providing a pleasurable
culinary experience

10:43.643 --> 10:44.632
at the same time.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.177
Pleasure is irrelevant.

10:46.245 --> 10:47.678
Well, l beg to differ.

10:47.747 --> 10:50.875
A good meal involves much
more than simply providing

10:50.950 --> 10:52.349
the proper nutrients.

10:52.418 --> 10:53.476
Why is that?

10:55.121 --> 10:57.180
Uh, well, it's a...

10:57.256 --> 10:59.816
There's a certain satisfaction
that comes from eating food

10:59.892 --> 11:01.223
that's been carefully prepared.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.488
l'm sure once you try it,
you'll understand.

11:03.529 --> 11:06.225
Now, how would you
like your chadre kab?

11:06.298 --> 11:07.822
Boiled? Baked?
Stir- fried?

11:07.900 --> 11:09.299
Preparation is irrelevant.

11:09.368 --> 11:10.596
ls irrelevant-- maybe.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.932
Maybe not.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.506
This is the first time
ingesting food for you

11:14.573 --> 11:16.564
for quite awhile.

11:16.642 --> 11:18.542
We'll go a little easy
on your stomach--

11:18.611 --> 11:19.543
steamed.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.310
Yes...

11:24.383 --> 11:28.911
This, uh...this recipe
has been in my family

11:28.988 --> 11:30.455
for generations.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.457
lt's considered a delicacy
among my people.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.516
You are Talaxian.

11:34.593 --> 11:36.652
Guilty as charged.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.128
Species 218.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.597
Well, l suppose so.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.224
Your biological
and technological

11:42.301 --> 11:44.064
distinctiveness
was added to our own.

11:46.906 --> 11:47.998
l hadn't realized that.

11:48.074 --> 11:50.235
A small freighter,
containing a crew of 39,

11:50.309 --> 11:51.901
taken in the Dalmine Sector.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.673
They were easily assimilated.

11:54.747 --> 11:57.648
Their dense musculature
made them excellent drones.

11:58.784 --> 12:01.480
Well...lucky for you, l guess.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.623
Your nutrients.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.025
Follow me.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.604
Please.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.308
Please what?

12:30.382 --> 12:32.873
lt's customary to sit
while eating.

12:45.364 --> 12:48.162
Uh, is something wrong?

12:48.234 --> 12:50.702
l am unaccustomed to this.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.465
Borg do not sit.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.974
Well, this is a day of firsts,
then, isn't it?

12:58.844 --> 13:00.311
Now...

13:01.981 --> 13:03.539
take a bite.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.308
Uh...try that one.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.219
Just kind of, uh...

13:12.291 --> 13:13.622
scoop some up.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.426
That's the way.

13:17.496 --> 13:18.929
Right into your mouth,

13:18.998 --> 13:22.365
just like a little scout ship
flying into a shuttle bay.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.836
Take it out.

13:26.906 --> 13:27.895
Keep your mouth closed.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.531
That's right.

13:31.577 --> 13:32.544
Now, you chew--

13:32.611 --> 13:33.703
chew, chew, chew, chew, chew.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.282
And swallow.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.184
Uh, swallow. Uh...

13:52.898 --> 13:54.729
Curious sensation.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.892
You'll get used to it.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.526
Have some more.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.009
May l bring you something else?

14:16.088 --> 14:18.613
A soothing cup of tea,
perhaps?

14:34.406 --> 14:37.307
You will be assimilated.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.571
Resistance is futile.

14:43.315 --> 14:45.112
Did you see that?

14:55.094 --> 14:56.959
What about this course?

14:57.029 --> 14:58.428
lt's a marginal adjustment.

14:58.497 --> 14:59.691
The nearest populated system

14:59.765 --> 15:01.289
is more than three
light- years away.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.992
Definitely not.

15:03.035 --> 15:06.095
You'd pass directly through
the Agrat- Mot Nebula,

15:06.171 --> 15:08.537
a key resource
in our trade negotiations

15:08.607 --> 15:09.733
with the Nassordin.

15:09.808 --> 15:11.207
l could chart the nebula

15:11.277 --> 15:12.869
- try to avoid...
- No, no.

15:12.945 --> 15:16.506
Are your translators
malfunctioning?

15:16.582 --> 15:18.914
Captain Janeway to the Bridge.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.212
lf you'll excuse me.

15:23.555 --> 15:24.920
Report.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.855
l've received
an alert from Security.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.121
Seven of Nine attacked
Neelix in the Mess Hall

15:29.194 --> 15:31.185
and three other crewmen
on Deck 2.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.924
Janeway to Seven of Nine.

15:32.998 --> 15:36.024
Seven, if you can hear me,
respond.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.591
What's her location?

15:37.670 --> 15:40.070
Deck 6, Section 28- Alpha.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.265
Take a security team.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.441
Captain...

15:44.510 --> 15:45.499
what is happening here?

15:45.577 --> 15:46.805
l wish l knew, Chancellor.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.143
Chakotay, seal off Deck 6.

15:52.551 --> 15:54.178
Seven of Nine.

16:13.238 --> 16:15.706
Security to Captain Janeway.

16:15.774 --> 16:17.639
We've just seen Seven of Nine.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.337
Her Borg shields
are fully operational

16:19.411 --> 16:20.878
and they've adapted
to our phasers.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.914
Acknowledged.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.677
Bridge to all
security personnel.

16:25.751 --> 16:29.118
Configure your weapons
to a rotating modulation,

16:29.188 --> 16:31.156
but keep them on"stun."

16:31.223 --> 16:32.212
Borg?

16:32.291 --> 16:34.316
You have Borg on your ship?

16:34.393 --> 16:35.621
lt's not what you think.

16:35.694 --> 16:37.127
She is a member of my crew.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.096
We liberated her
from the collective.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.392
She's no longer a Borg.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.559
Then why is she equipped
with Borg shields?

16:42.634 --> 16:43.760
l don't know.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.076
She's able to cross
through the security fields.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.272
She's entering
the armory on Deck 6.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.222
Deck 10.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.180
She's in a turbolift.

17:07.259 --> 17:08.817
Cut power to the turboshafts.

17:08.894 --> 17:11.624
She's blocking my commands
with a Borg encryption code.

17:11.696 --> 17:12.685
Janeway to Tuvok.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.232
Seven's apparently
headed for Deck 10.

17:14.299 --> 17:15.857
Can you get there
before she does?

17:15.968 --> 17:18.163
l'm moving into position
now, Captain.

17:19.805 --> 17:21.363
We'll take position here.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.956
Lower your weapon
and stand down.

17:40.826 --> 17:42.555
Fire.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.436
Tuvok to Bridge.

17:53.505 --> 17:54.904
We were unsuccessful.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.474
l have wounded.

17:57.543 --> 17:59.170
She's moving toward
Junction 32- Alpha.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.768
The Shuttle Bay.

18:00.879 --> 18:02.847
l'm erecting a force field.

18:02.881 --> 18:05.679
Harry, reroute all
available power to Deck 10.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.049
Done.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.300
She's accessing
transporter control.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.535
She used
a site- to- site transport.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.272
She's in a shuttlecraft...

18:34.346 --> 18:35.608
powering engines.

18:35.681 --> 18:36.670
Seal the launch doors.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.412
Tractor beam!

18:42.488 --> 18:43.819
No effect.

18:43.889 --> 18:46.357
She's remodulated
the shuttle's shield harmonics.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.416
Captain.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.519
Seven's headed directly
into B'omar space.

18:50.596 --> 18:51.927
She's gone to warp.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.589
She's masked
the shuttle's ion trail.

18:53.665 --> 18:54.723
l've lost her signal.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.529
She's gone.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.008
We'll do everything in our power
to find her,

19:10.082 --> 19:12.573
but we will need permission
to enter B'omar space

19:12.651 --> 19:14.414
to track her shuttle
effectively.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.182
Let's tally the events,
shall we?

19:17.256 --> 19:19.952
First, you arrive
uninvited and unwelcome,

19:20.025 --> 19:22.425
requesting a shortcut
through our space.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.985
Then you proceed to unleash
some sort of rogue Borg

19:25.063 --> 19:28.055
and now you want us to help you
get it back.

19:28.133 --> 19:29.794
l apologize
for what's happened here,

19:29.868 --> 19:32.632
but we certainly didn't
"unleash" anyone.

19:32.704 --> 19:35.434
We can resolve this situation
quickly, gentlemen,

19:35.507 --> 19:36.906
if we work together.

19:36.975 --> 19:39.500
Captain Janeway,
after what l've seen here,

19:39.578 --> 19:41.808
l question your competence.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.440
May l remind you
that you're still on my ship.

19:44.516 --> 19:49.385
And you are only one vessel
among many of ours.

19:49.454 --> 19:53.515
Your Borg will be dealt with
quickly and efficiently.

19:53.592 --> 19:55.287
lt's being tracked as we speak.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.385
Tracked...how?

19:57.462 --> 20:00.260
Every vessel, every object,

20:00.332 --> 20:04.428
every particle of dust
that crosses our borders

20:04.503 --> 20:07.370
is immediately identified
and traced

20:07.439 --> 20:09.407
by our perimeter grid.

20:09.474 --> 20:11.601
The Borg will be found...
and destroyed.

20:11.677 --> 20:12.644
Chancellor...

20:12.711 --> 20:14.611
There will be no sharing
of information.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.612
From this point on,

20:15.681 --> 20:17.273
your vessel
will maintain a distance

20:17.349 --> 20:19.613
of at least five light- years
from our borders.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.585
Any deviation

20:21.653 --> 20:23.985
will be considered
an act of aggression.

20:25.857 --> 20:28.189
Commander,

20:28.260 --> 20:30.854
escort our guests
to the transporter room.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.464
Captain's Log, supplemental.

20:41.540 --> 20:42.939
l've assembled a team

20:43.008 --> 20:46.205
to analyze every square meter
of the cargo bay.

20:46.278 --> 20:48.075
This has essentially been
her quarters

20:48.247 --> 20:49.737
for the past two months.

20:49.815 --> 20:52.181
l'm determined
to find something here

20:52.251 --> 20:55.345
that might shed some light
on Seven of Nine's actions.

21:05.964 --> 21:07.932
You're taking this kind
of hard, aren't you?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.900
What's that supposed to mean?

21:13.505 --> 21:15.530
We had a working relationship.

21:15.607 --> 21:19.065
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

21:19.144 --> 21:21.510
lt's not what you're thinking.

21:21.580 --> 21:24.378
What am l thinking, Harry?

21:24.449 --> 21:26.542
Never mind.

21:45.737 --> 21:47.500
Take a look at this.

21:53.779 --> 21:55.178
Anything?

21:55.247 --> 21:56.771
lt's a Borg data- link.

21:56.848 --> 21:59.783
lt contains a succession
of log entries

21:59.851 --> 22:01.842
written in Borg
alphanumeric code.

22:01.953 --> 22:03.853
l'm getting pretty good
with the Borg language.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.117
l think l can translate them.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.179
Get on it.

22:07.859 --> 22:10.555
lt seems we've made quite
an impression on the B'omar.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.927
ln the last hour, they've
doubled the number of ships

22:12.998 --> 22:14.295
patrolling their borders,

22:14.366 --> 22:16.027
and they've increased
the sensitivity

22:16.101 --> 22:17.728
of the perimeter
grid by 36 percent.

22:17.803 --> 22:19.065
So much for diplomacy.

22:19.137 --> 22:20.536
The Doctor analyzed the data

22:20.605 --> 22:22.539
from Seven of Nine's
last transport.

22:22.607 --> 22:24.302
He's found something
he wants us to see.

22:26.044 --> 22:27.841
Maybe this was inevitable.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.744
Even if Seven did want
to stay on Voyager,

22:29.815 --> 22:31.715
her Borg nature
may have won out.

22:31.783 --> 22:33.751
We can remove implant
after implant,

22:33.819 --> 22:36.811
but maybe at her core,

22:36.888 --> 22:38.981
she'll always be part
of the collective.

22:39.057 --> 22:40.649
No. l won't accept that.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.318
Deck 5.

22:44.396 --> 22:47.092
She was responding to us--

22:47.165 --> 22:49.690
interacting with people
outside of the collective

22:49.768 --> 22:50.757
for the first time.

22:50.836 --> 22:52.895
She was adapting
to this environment

22:52.971 --> 22:54.700
and to this crew.

22:54.773 --> 22:56.240
But where is she going?

22:56.308 --> 22:58.333
We've scanned space

22:58.410 --> 23:00.002
for a distance
of 40 light- years.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.138
We've found no evidence
of Borg ships,

23:02.214 --> 23:03.909
so she can't be trying
to rejoin the collective.

23:03.982 --> 23:06.246
She may plan to take the
shuttle back to Borg space.

23:06.318 --> 23:07.683
10, 000 light- years from here?

23:07.753 --> 23:08.777
l don't think so.
No.

23:08.854 --> 23:10.481
Something else is going on.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.922
We're missing a piece
of the puzzle.

23:14.025 --> 23:15.583
ln the meantime,
the B'omar intend

23:15.660 --> 23:19.027
to find her, and if they do,
she'll probably resist them.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.429
One more reason
for us to find her first.

23:26.371 --> 23:27.736
What have you found, Doctor?

23:27.806 --> 23:29.467
Something most peculiar.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.771
This graphic represents
the matter conversion data

23:31.843 --> 23:33.401
from Seven of Nine's
last transport.

23:33.478 --> 23:34.467
lf you'll notice,

23:34.546 --> 23:36.776
there's a high concentration
of Borg organelles

23:36.848 --> 23:39.373
in the bone marrow
and lymphatic tissue.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.976
The dormant nanoprobes
in Seven of Nine's cells

23:42.053 --> 23:43.213
have reasserted themselves.

23:43.288 --> 23:44.846
Taken over blood cell
production,

23:44.923 --> 23:47.289
and they're growing
new Borg implants.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.986
13 percent
of the Borg technology

23:49.094 --> 23:50.459
l removed three weeks ago

23:50.529 --> 23:52.588
has regenerated
in a matter of hours.

23:52.664 --> 23:55.394
You said the nanoprobes in
her bloodstream were dormant.

23:55.467 --> 23:56.525
What reactivated them?

23:56.601 --> 23:58.000
l don't know.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.765
But l've developed a way
to stop the process.

24:00.839 --> 24:03.603
This hypospray contains
a genetic resequencing vector.

24:03.675 --> 24:05.768
lt should neutralize
the nanoprobes.

24:05.844 --> 24:08.210
That means someone needs
to get close enough to do it.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.551
Report.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.713
We've analyzed
the B'omar perimeter grid.

24:17.789 --> 24:18.915
lt's sophisticated,

24:18.990 --> 24:21.083
but not without
its vulnerabilities.

24:21.159 --> 24:23.320
lt might be possible
to penetrate the grid

24:23.395 --> 24:25.761
by recalibrating our shields
to match its frequency.

24:25.831 --> 24:28.698
The trick is going to be
our energy signature.

24:28.767 --> 24:29.859
Voyager's too big to hide,

24:29.935 --> 24:32.665
but a shuttlecraft with
the proper shield modulation

24:32.737 --> 24:34.136
and its engines powered down

24:34.206 --> 24:36.902
could drift right through
without so much as a peep.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.944
Nice work, gentlemen.
Proceed.

24:40.078 --> 24:42.979
The Doctor's genetic resequencer
should keep her sedated

24:43.048 --> 24:45.073
until you get back
to the ship.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.981
Once you've penetrated
the perimeter,

24:47.052 --> 24:49.987
there will be no further
communication with Voyager.

24:50.055 --> 24:51.386
You'll be on your own.

24:51.456 --> 24:53.481
Captain, it is possible

24:53.558 --> 24:55.719
that Seven will adapt
to the resequencer.

24:55.794 --> 24:56.988
l know.

24:57.062 --> 25:02.591
lf it fails and you're unable
to reason with her...

25:02.667 --> 25:05.636
you have my authorization
to stop her...

25:05.704 --> 25:07.695
with any force necessary.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.099
Understood.

25:20.952 --> 25:25.321
Seven of Nine, grid nine- two
of subjunction 1 2.

25:26.591 --> 25:28.218
You will be assimilated.

25:45.944 --> 25:47.741
Borg drone, you have committed

25:47.812 --> 25:51.248
an infraction
against the B'omar Sovereignty.

25:52.384 --> 25:56.445
Cut power to your engines
and lower your shields.

25:56.521 --> 25:58.614
Prepare to be boarded.

25:59.824 --> 26:02.850
You will proceed no further.

26:02.961 --> 26:03.928
We will not...

26:12.003 --> 26:14.494
l'm detecting
weapon signatures...

26:14.573 --> 26:17.041
Federation and B'omar.

26:17.108 --> 26:21.135
Five B'omar vessels
are adrift...heavily damaged.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.305
Life signs are stable.

26:23.381 --> 26:24.871
l've located Seven's shuttle.

26:25.016 --> 26:27.746
lt's 2. 5 million
kilometers from here.

26:27.819 --> 26:29.150
Adjust course to intercept.

26:36.061 --> 26:37.653
The implants in Seven's body

26:37.729 --> 26:38.923
are disrupting
the transporter signal.

26:39.030 --> 26:40.520
l can't get a lock.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.726
See if you can remodulate
our transporters

26:42.801 --> 26:44.325
to match her shields.

26:44.402 --> 26:46.700
You want to beam in there?

26:46.771 --> 26:48.705
Yes.

26:48.773 --> 26:51.435
l don't think
that's such a good idea, Tuvok.

26:51.509 --> 26:53.909
Close quarters...
Borg against Vulcan.

26:53.979 --> 26:55.947
No offense, but you
don't stand a chance

26:56.014 --> 26:57.709
if she decides
to put up a fight.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.773
lt's my hope
that the element of surprise

26:59.851 --> 27:00.909
will work in my favor.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.118
Do you have a better idea?

27:06.257 --> 27:08.282
Come to think of it, no.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.553
She's charging weapons.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.122
Set my coordinates
for the aft compartment.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.428
Ready.

27:16.501 --> 27:17.968
Energize.

27:34.452 --> 27:38.718
Come on, Tuvok.
Give me a sign.

27:47.098 --> 27:50.431
Warning. Propulsion systems
are off- line.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.867
Damn!

28:11.356 --> 28:13.984
That's a level- 5 force field,
Lieutenant.

28:14.059 --> 28:15.959
l suggest you be more careful.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.359
Why have you left Voyager?

28:20.098 --> 28:22.123
l am Borg.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.567
You were Borg...
but you're human now.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.502
You are part of our crew.

28:32.210 --> 28:35.509
For a brief time, l was human.

28:35.580 --> 28:39.778
But l have come to realize
that l am Borg.

28:39.851 --> 28:42.911
l will always be Borg.

28:42.987 --> 28:45.455
What prompted this realization?

28:45.523 --> 28:49.687
Every Borg ship is coded to emit
a distinct resonance frequency

28:49.761 --> 28:53.060
to guide drones who have become
separated from the collective.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.621
A homing beacon.

28:54.699 --> 28:56.894
Yes.

28:56.968 --> 28:58.936
l am following a signal.

28:59.003 --> 29:02.598
A Borg vessel is waiting for me.

29:02.707 --> 29:05.699
We've scanned this entire region
for Borg.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.609
There are none.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.146
You're wrong.

29:11.516 --> 29:12.847
They are here.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.316
Vulcan.

29:21.392 --> 29:24.020
Species 3259.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.619
Your enlarged neocortex

29:25.697 --> 29:28.325
produces superior
analytical abilities.

29:28.399 --> 29:31.027
Your distinctiveness
will be added to our...

29:33.471 --> 29:34.836
Seven?

29:40.345 --> 29:41.710
No.

29:46.050 --> 29:48.018
l will not assimilate you.

29:50.755 --> 29:52.382
Once l have returned
to the collective,

29:52.457 --> 29:54.288
you will go back to Voyager

29:54.359 --> 29:56.691
and tell Captain Janeway
what's happened to me.

29:58.530 --> 30:03.934
Thank her for her patience...
for her kindness.

30:04.035 --> 30:06.401
Curious.

30:06.471 --> 30:12.239
Your behavior demonstrates
affection and sentiment.

30:12.310 --> 30:15.746
Traits of humanity...
hardly Borg.

30:18.616 --> 30:22.609
You have been experiencing
hallucinations, flashbacks?

30:22.687 --> 30:24.279
Yes.

30:24.355 --> 30:25.720
Does that usually occur

30:25.790 --> 30:28.020
when a resonance signal
is activated?

30:30.161 --> 30:31.594
No.

30:31.663 --> 30:36.999
Seven of Nine, grid nine- two
of subjunction 1 2.

30:37.068 --> 30:41.903
But l can hear them...
calling me.

30:41.973 --> 30:44.567
l'm frightened.

30:44.642 --> 30:46.132
That's understandable.

30:46.211 --> 30:48.941
Lower the force field.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.776
We can return to Voyager

30:50.849 --> 30:53.511
and find out
what's happening to you.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.610
l am your shipmate.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.781
We can return to Voyager
together.

31:01.092 --> 31:03.754
l must rejoin the collective.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.865
Captain's Log, supplemental.

31:11.936 --> 31:15.201
l've been trying to retrace
Seven of Nine's footsteps...

31:15.273 --> 31:17.605
her actions
during the last few days,

31:17.675 --> 31:19.108
but l'm still no closer

31:19.177 --> 31:21.042
to understanding
what's happened.

31:26.651 --> 31:27.618
Captain?

31:27.685 --> 31:29.277
Am l disturbing you?

31:29.354 --> 31:31.754
Not at all, Harry.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.815
l've managed to decipher
Seven's log entries.

31:36.494 --> 31:38.655
And?

31:38.730 --> 31:39.856
There's nothing that indicates

31:39.931 --> 31:41.296
she was planning
to leave the ship.

31:41.366 --> 31:43.664
The entries are
pretty unremarkable.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.362
She describes
her daily routines

31:45.436 --> 31:47.336
the number of hours
spent regenerating,

31:47.405 --> 31:48.337
that sort of thing.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.169
There were
some personal log entries,

31:50.241 --> 31:52.835
mostly observations
about the crew's behavior.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.379
l'm mentioned
in quite a few of them.

31:55.446 --> 31:59.382
Apparently, she finds
my behavior easy to predict,

31:59.450 --> 32:00.348
whatever that means.

32:00.451 --> 32:01.679
Don't take it personally.

32:01.719 --> 32:04.586
Coming from Seven,
that's probably a compliment.

32:06.357 --> 32:09.053
Uh, the most recent entries
are kind of strange.

32:11.195 --> 32:13.026
Descriptions of bizarre images,

32:13.097 --> 32:14.826
almost like a record
of her dreams.

32:14.899 --> 32:15.866
The hallucinations?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.060
Maybe so.

32:17.135 --> 32:19.467
Sometimes she's in a Borg vessel

32:19.537 --> 32:21.903
running...or hiding
behind a bulkhead,

32:21.973 --> 32:23.270
falling down a shaft.

32:23.341 --> 32:25.309
Borg everywhere, chasing her.

32:25.376 --> 32:26.434
Nightmarish stuff.

32:26.511 --> 32:28.274
What about this...bird?

32:28.346 --> 32:30.143
She mentions it several times.

32:30.214 --> 32:32.182
lt flies at her, shrieking.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.581
l don't know what it means.

32:33.651 --> 32:35.346
"The feathers are black.

32:35.420 --> 32:38.287
"Wingspan approximately
one half meter.

32:38.356 --> 32:40.381
"The eyes are yellow

32:40.458 --> 32:43.484
"and it has a powerful
triangular beak.

32:43.561 --> 32:44.892
When it looks at me..."

32:46.698 --> 32:48.996
"l am paralyzed.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.763
"l cannot move.

32:51.836 --> 32:54.634
"lt seems to know me,

32:54.706 --> 32:58.472
"but l don't understand
how that's possible.

32:58.543 --> 33:04.140
"lt's merely a bird,
an inferior form of life,

33:04.248 --> 33:09.242
but the sight of it
fills me with fear."

33:09.287 --> 33:12.723
lt sounds like she's describing
a member of the...

33:12.790 --> 33:15.850
Corvidae family, like a crow
or...

33:20.598 --> 33:22.429
Or a raven.

33:24.769 --> 33:27.294
She's describing a raven.

33:27.372 --> 33:29.431
Why is that important?

33:29.507 --> 33:31.907
Because now l know
what to look for.

33:35.313 --> 33:38.214
Chakotay, calibrate
our long- range sensors

33:38.282 --> 33:40.477
to scan for
any Federation signature

33:40.551 --> 33:41.984
other than our two shuttlecraft.

33:42.053 --> 33:43.486
- Captain?
- Do it.

33:43.554 --> 33:44.987
Bring the ship about, Ensign,

33:45.089 --> 33:48.115
and lay in a course
for B'omar space.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.318
Aye, Captain.

34:01.572 --> 34:04.473
The resonance signal is coming
from the lunar surface.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.245
The Borg are waiting
for me there.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.342
l don't know why l'm frightened.

34:14.418 --> 34:15.386
They are my people.

34:15.453 --> 34:19.047
lf you are afraid,
then leave this place.

34:19.123 --> 34:21.284
Once l have been reintegrated
into the collective,

34:21.359 --> 34:22.826
my fears will disappear.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.726
Deactivate the force field.

34:26.797 --> 34:29.766
l will accompany you
to the surface.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.460
You don't need to go alone.

34:35.206 --> 34:37.367
You would be assimilated.

34:37.442 --> 34:39.433
l don't believe so.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.909
l think the situation
is not what it appears.

34:41.978 --> 34:43.879
What do you mean?
What else could it be?

34:43.947 --> 34:45.882
l am uncertain,
but l am willing

34:45.949 --> 34:48.543
to go with you to the surface
to find out.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.261
Voyager to Paris.

35:00.364 --> 35:02.059
Paris here, Captain.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.000
Glad to hear your voice.

35:04.068 --> 35:06.127
Tuvok is with Seven of Nine.

35:06.204 --> 35:08.638
l haven't been able to establish
communication with him

35:08.706 --> 35:11.231
since he transported
to her shuttle.

35:11.309 --> 35:14.005
l've tracked them
to an M- Class moon

35:14.078 --> 35:16.842
orbiting the fifth planet
of a yellow dwarf star.

35:16.914 --> 35:19.178
l'm picking up
an unusual resonance signal

35:19.250 --> 35:20.376
from the surface.

35:20.451 --> 35:21.383
lt's erratic.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.079
l haven't been able
to identify it.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.883
Acknowledged.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.719
We've detected
several B'omar ships

35:26.791 --> 35:28.554
closing in on your position.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.423
What's your condition?

35:30.495 --> 35:31.621
Warp engines are off- line.

35:31.696 --> 35:33.823
Shields are at 50 percent.

35:33.898 --> 35:35.422
Try to locate them, Tom.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.592
We're on our way.

35:43.508 --> 35:45.203
The signal's getting stronger.

35:45.276 --> 35:46.868
They're here.
l'm sure of it.

35:46.944 --> 35:48.502
This way.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.044
lf you wish, we can return
to the shuttle.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.083
No. l have to find out.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.301
What is it?

36:14.372 --> 36:16.272
lt's a Federation vessel

36:16.340 --> 36:18.672
partially assimilated
by the Borg.

36:18.743 --> 36:20.836
There are no life signs.

36:20.912 --> 36:21.879
Tritanium decay

36:21.979 --> 36:24.948
suggests it has been here
for nearly 20 years.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.062
This vessel is familiar.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.210
This is the signal
that's drawn me here.

37:10.161 --> 37:13.130
Annika!

37:13.197 --> 37:17.429
Run, Annika!

37:17.501 --> 37:19.833
Run! Hide!

37:28.145 --> 37:29.237
Papa?

37:30.815 --> 37:32.180
Help me.

37:41.125 --> 37:44.253
No! No!

37:45.796 --> 37:48.287
Seven, l'm here.

37:48.366 --> 37:49.856
Listen to me.

37:54.505 --> 37:55.733
Come.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.779
lt happened here.

38:14.358 --> 38:15.689
This is where it began.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.557
This is where l was assimilated.

38:29.607 --> 38:31.598
This was our ship.

38:34.679 --> 38:36.010
We lived here.

38:37.948 --> 38:40.280
We lived here for a long time.

38:44.622 --> 38:46.351
My father did experiments.

38:46.424 --> 38:48.255
They were very important

38:48.326 --> 38:50.794
and we had to travel
a long way.

38:54.598 --> 38:56.395
l had my birthday here.

38:59.136 --> 39:01.696
My cake had
six candles on it and...

39:03.674 --> 39:05.835
and one more to grow on.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.438
And then the men came.

39:14.685 --> 39:18.018
Papa tried to fight them,
but they were too strong.

39:20.057 --> 39:21.422
l tried to hide.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.391
Maybe they wouldn't find me
because l was little.

39:26.464 --> 39:29.228
But they did.

39:32.436 --> 39:34.370
And then Papa said
we were going to crash

39:34.438 --> 39:37.839
and...the big man
picked me up...

39:39.710 --> 39:42.076
and then suddenly,
we weren't on this ship anymore.

39:42.146 --> 39:43.204
We were somewhere else.

39:48.919 --> 39:51.513
And then l became Borg.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.756
Fascinating.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.259
This resonance signal
must have been active

39:57.328 --> 40:01.264
since the ship was assimilated
and Voyager passed within range.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.159
The ship is under attack.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.794
The B'omar.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.838
The ship will collapse.

40:08.906 --> 40:09.964
We must get out of here.

40:22.887 --> 40:25.287
The B'omar still aren't
responding to our hails.

40:25.356 --> 40:26.789
Standing by to fire.

40:26.857 --> 40:28.586
Target their weapon systems.

40:28.659 --> 40:30.991
Tom, what's your status?

40:31.061 --> 40:32.153
l've located Tuvok and Seven,

40:32.229 --> 40:33.560
but there's a lot
of interference.

40:33.631 --> 40:36.395
l'm attempting
to lock onto them now, Captain.

40:40.171 --> 40:41.399
This way.

40:58.889 --> 40:59.981
Are you all right?

41:00.057 --> 41:01.456
l am undamaged.

41:03.861 --> 41:05.852
This was the only way
to the hatch.

41:05.930 --> 41:07.659
Perhaps there is
another way out.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.602
There's a hull rupture
in the forward compartment.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.035
lt may provide
a means of escape.

41:25.950 --> 41:27.212
Start digging.

41:32.289 --> 41:33.449
Quickly.

41:39.964 --> 41:42.159
We've disabled
two of their ships.

41:42.233 --> 41:43.962
The third is still
firing at the surface.

41:44.034 --> 41:46.002
We're being hailed,
audio only.

41:46.070 --> 41:50.837
You're committing
an act of war, Captain.

41:50.908 --> 41:53.399
You've left me no choice,
Councilor.

41:53.477 --> 41:54.967
Reinforcements are arriving.

41:55.045 --> 41:56.239
You will be destroyed...

41:56.313 --> 41:57.405
l don't have time for this.

41:57.481 --> 41:58.675
Target their weapons array.

42:00.317 --> 42:01.784
Seven, l need your help.

42:31.615 --> 42:32.980
l've got them, Captain.

42:33.083 --> 42:34.414
We're on our way back
to Voyager.

42:34.485 --> 42:35.850
Acknowledged.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.046
Good work.

42:39.790 --> 42:41.849
l'm detecting a fleet
of B'omar vessels approaching.

42:41.926 --> 42:43.894
68 ships.

42:43.961 --> 42:47.453
Ensign, as soon as
Mr. Paris's shuttle has docked,

42:47.531 --> 42:50.329
take us out of B'omar space.
Warp 8.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.732
Aye, sir.

42:54.371 --> 42:57.340
Looks like there won't be
any shortcuts this time.

43:16.026 --> 43:17.516
There you are.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.586
l wanted to tell you

43:19.663 --> 43:22.632
that the Doctor said he could
adjust one of your implants

43:22.700 --> 43:26.261
so that you won't receive
any more homing signals.

43:26.337 --> 43:27.531
Thank you.

43:27.605 --> 43:30.574
l hope you don't mind
that l activated this program.

43:30.641 --> 43:32.506
Not at all.

43:34.545 --> 43:37.275
l've been thinking
about what you said...

43:37.348 --> 43:40.784
that this was a place
to encourage your imagination.

43:40.851 --> 43:43.046
ls that appealing to you?

43:45.789 --> 43:47.654
l'm not certain.

43:50.294 --> 43:54.754
l find myself...
constructing scenarios,

43:54.832 --> 43:57.596
considering alternative
possibilities.

43:58.969 --> 44:01.870
What if my parents and l
had not encountered the Borg?

44:01.972 --> 44:04.031
What would our lives have been?

44:05.743 --> 44:08.871
l would have been raised
by them, learned from them.

44:08.946 --> 44:12.211
They would have influenced
what l became--

44:12.282 --> 44:14.147
who and what l am.

44:14.218 --> 44:19.053
And you...would have done
the same for them.

44:19.123 --> 44:21.887
lf you'd like to know
more about your parents,

44:21.959 --> 44:25.588
there's information
in the Federation database.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.255
lnformation?

44:27.331 --> 44:30.664
lt seems they were
fairly well- known.

44:30.734 --> 44:32.827
For being unconventional

44:32.903 --> 44:36.339
and for some rather unique
scientific theories.

44:36.407 --> 44:39.240
You might like to read
what's there.

44:39.309 --> 44:43.678
lt might...
encourage your imagination.

44:45.215 --> 44:46.705
Perhaps l will.

44:48.485 --> 44:49.850
Someday.

44:51.689 --> 44:52.986
Good night, Captain.
