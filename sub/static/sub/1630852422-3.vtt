00:05.880 --> 00:08.440
Are you going to tell
your father about money?

00:08.440 --> 00:10.080
Congratulations, George!

00:10.080 --> 00:12.440
Daddy is a sly old dog.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.200
Your new stepmother's
younger than you.

00:14.200 --> 00:17.760
Please, don't ask
me to bail Ian out again.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.440
I'll not throw
good money after bad.

00:20.440 --> 00:23.600
What is the point of you?!
What are you for?!

00:23.600 --> 00:25.720
You are? Peter Combe.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.880
What's on the menu tonight?
Drinking or dancing?

00:28.880 --> 00:29.960
Both.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.240
What is it?
It's Louise's handwriting.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.400
It's a crank.
You're not to brood on it.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.000
I've never stayed at
L'Hotel Saint Mariette.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.320
I've never even heard of it.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.320
I think we can make
it work between us.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.800
But we have to stop doing
terrible things to each other.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.480
What terrible things have you done?

00:47.480 --> 00:49.680
Nothing, just...

00:51.040 --> 00:52.400
We'll be all right.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.080
Ugh.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.120
He's here.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.200
What?

01:16.200 --> 01:18.440
Where is he? In the drawing room.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.600
You and your disappearing acts.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.320
My God, how beautiful you are.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.600
You love me.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.800
I must do, mustn't I?

01:46.800 --> 01:50.080
And you want this marriage to work?

01:50.080 --> 01:53.680
We both want this marriage
to work, Ian, we agreed to that.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.400
Then there are certain
particular assurances I need.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.000
What are they?

02:02.920 --> 02:04.880
My God, it's ridiculous really.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.920
I know it was you.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.560
I knew it.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.840
I know you forged those letters.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.040
What?

02:41.040 --> 02:43.040
Louise swore on our son's lives.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.840
Well, then you're a fool, Ian.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.000
You're a poor fool.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Of course she swore!
She swore, and I believed you.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.760
And the only person it could
possibly be is me, of course it is.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.080
I'm the culprit, of course I am.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.680
Margaret, you will
go to court...No!

02:54.680 --> 02:56.360
..and you will submit
to an injunction

02:56.360 --> 02:59.880
that forbids you forever talking
about my sons or their mother again.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.960
I won't go to court, and
I won't submit to anything!

03:01.960 --> 03:04.720
Yes, you are. You will.No, I won't!

03:04.720 --> 03:06.680
Of all the things you've
ever done to me, Ian,

03:06.680 --> 03:08.240
this has to be the absolute worst!

03:08.240 --> 03:10.600
I cannot believe you
believe this about me.

03:10.600 --> 03:11.960
I want you to leave.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.560
But you will submit
to that injunction.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.120
I've got the proof.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.360
SHE BREATHES SHAKILY

04:08.760 --> 04:10.040
Dora!

04:51.040 --> 04:53.640
The date for the
hearing has been set.

04:55.240 --> 04:58.000
This goes against all our advice.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.360
If you submit to this injunction,

05:01.360 --> 05:03.640
it is an admission of liability.

05:03.640 --> 05:06.720
Mr Jauncey, I know that I
pay you for your advice,

05:06.720 --> 05:09.560
but the Duke requires me to do this,

05:09.560 --> 05:11.040
so I will do it.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.760
You're not going to like it.

05:18.760 --> 05:19.800
What is it?

05:22.760 --> 05:25.120
Shall I tell Cheeseman
to bring the...Yes!

05:29.840 --> 05:32.360
Ugh!

05:32.360 --> 05:33.680
Ah!

05:52.840 --> 05:54.040
SHE SCOFFS

05:56.720 --> 05:59.920
What are you doing, Ian?
I did what you asked.

05:59.920 --> 06:03.640
I've had you banned from
Inveraray and its environs.

06:07.640 --> 06:10.600
Over here is environs.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.400
Over there's the
whole rest of the world,

06:13.400 --> 06:14.760
you stay in the rest of the world,

06:14.760 --> 06:17.240
and you won't be
in breach of the law.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.640
You've breached the law.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.080
You broke into my home,
and you stole private property.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.280
As your husband, I have every right
to enter our shared domicile.

06:24.280 --> 06:28.160
And I have every right to enter the
castle that I bloody well paid for!

06:28.160 --> 06:29.520
No, you don't.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.000
I had you banned.

06:35.080 --> 06:38.640
Please, Margaret, if you're
concerned for the whereabouts

06:38.640 --> 06:41.840
of certain private properties,

06:41.840 --> 06:44.600
just give a
description of said items

06:44.600 --> 06:46.120
to that friendly bobby there.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.160
No?

06:52.200 --> 06:54.560
Don't want to talk to
the nice policeman?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.760
We had a deal, Ian.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.360
Caveat emptor, darling.
I have children.

07:01.360 --> 07:02.480
So do I.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.960
What do you want?

07:17.160 --> 07:18.840
I want peace and quiet.

07:22.120 --> 07:26.640
I want...time to think.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.600
I believe I'm owed that.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.360
When do I get my things back?

07:48.280 --> 07:50.640
Let's talk when I'm ready.
Yep?

07:53.200 --> 07:54.920
Oh, and, um...

07:57.120 --> 08:01.360
..everything's locked
away from prying eyes,

08:01.360 --> 08:03.880
so you can stop sweating about that,

08:03.880 --> 08:05.560
at least for the time being.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.720
I'm only showing you this
because you're my barrister.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.520
Is this you?

08:53.520 --> 08:54.720
Of course it's not bloody me,

08:54.720 --> 08:57.600
I wouldn't be showing
it to you if it were me.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.160
It is her.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.560
She does photograph well,
doesn't she?

09:02.560 --> 09:04.280
So, there we are.

09:04.280 --> 09:07.680
Divorce on the basis of
multiple adulteries, cut and dry.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.960
Actually, no.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.600
I'm afraid you need more.

09:12.600 --> 09:16.280
What the hell are you talking about?
How could I possibly need more?

09:16.280 --> 09:18.200
I brought you all of this.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.760
You have a photograph
for god's sake,

09:19.760 --> 09:23.680
you have love letters,
you have a diary full of men,

09:23.680 --> 09:25.680
and then there's the V.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.160
You know what that is?

09:27.160 --> 09:28.600
That's her sign.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.400
That's her bare-forked
animal legs open

09:31.400 --> 09:32.800
for her legion of lovers.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.720
"V", I mean, it's everywhere.
You say I need more.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.840
The letters, the diaries,
the, uh...image,

09:40.840 --> 09:42.640
they're not recent.

09:42.640 --> 09:43.960
You continued living with her,

09:43.960 --> 09:47.960
presumably
enjoying...conjugal relations.

09:47.960 --> 09:51.120
Only when I couldn't fight her off.
She's like a wolf,

09:51.120 --> 09:53.440
hold you down and strip
the meat from your bones.

09:53.440 --> 09:57.040
But the law can therefore decide
that you condoned her behaviour.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.800
We need to prove that
she was adulterous

09:58.800 --> 10:01.840
and continued to be so
after you'd separated.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.360
Spit it out, Emslie,
I'm getting old and dying here.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.720
What do we need?

10:05.720 --> 10:08.240
We need evidence that
she's still at it.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.320
We need the diary she uses now.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.040
Papa. Shh, shh.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.520
DOOR CLOSES

10:52.040 --> 10:54.280
WHISPERS: Where will it be?

10:54.280 --> 10:55.800
By her bed. By her bed?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.440
Papa, I don't want to.

11:01.760 --> 11:02.960
Come on.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.800
Jeanne, this is going to be fun.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.720
We're like cat burglars.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.440
Raffles the Gentleman Thief.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.160
DOOR OPENS

11:14.160 --> 11:15.600
BARKING

11:15.600 --> 11:17.040
Ah! Get it!

11:17.040 --> 11:18.480
I don't know where it is! Get it!

11:18.480 --> 11:19.840
I don't know where it is!

11:19.840 --> 11:22.360
In the bedside table! Middle drawer,
look in middle drawer!

11:22.360 --> 11:24.080
Ah!
BARKING CONTINUES

11:24.080 --> 11:25.520
Stop it! I've got it. Stop it.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.920
I've got it. Sure? Yes, I've got it!

11:27.920 --> 11:29.760
SHE GASPS

11:29.760 --> 11:31.000
DOOR SLAMS

11:31.000 --> 11:32.320
Ian!

11:45.880 --> 11:47.240
Ian!

11:48.440 --> 11:50.400
Ian! Stop!

11:50.400 --> 11:51.600
Oh!

11:54.360 --> 11:55.720
Ian!

11:55.720 --> 11:58.560
SHE SOBS

11:58.560 --> 11:59.760
Ian!

12:21.920 --> 12:25.080
My Lord, I present Ian
Campbell, the Duke of Argyll's,

12:25.080 --> 12:28.000
petition for divorce from
Margaret, Duchess of Argyll

12:28.000 --> 12:30.360
on the ground of
her multiple adulteries.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.280
The Duke, the pursuer in this case,

12:32.280 --> 12:34.440
is fully aware that
a petition brought

12:34.440 --> 12:36.880
by the husband against
his wife is unusual,

12:36.880 --> 12:40.120
but the evidence we will present at
a date given by the court

12:40.120 --> 12:45.880
is unequivocal, highly intimate
and, frankly...utterly damning.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.040
You all right? Mm.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.480
There are reporters
outside the house.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.000
They come in the garden,
knock on the windows,

12:59.000 --> 13:00.880
shout through the door,

13:00.880 --> 13:03.000
questions about you,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.800
about you and men.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.560
They're lies, Daddy.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.720
It's all lies, Ian's lies.

13:08.720 --> 13:12.640
He's trying to turn
everyone against me.

13:12.640 --> 13:15.160
That Judge Wheatley, who
banned me from Inveraray,

13:15.160 --> 13:17.640
I've heard that he's
a member of Clan Campbell.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.480
That's the same clan as Ian, Daddy.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.400
But nobody reports on that, do they?

13:21.400 --> 13:22.960
But how can that be allowed?

13:22.960 --> 13:25.640
His doctor, Petro,
saying that I'm mad.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.840
There are things that
I could say about him too, Daddy

13:27.840 --> 13:31.720
but I don't, but he just makes
it all about me, my fault.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.400
I'm getting too old for this.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.760
You have to warn me, warn us.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.640
I don't want to learn
it from the newspaper

13:40.640 --> 13:45.520
or have some pimply youth
scream at me over the garden wall.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.920
What does Ian have?

13:48.920 --> 13:51.720
Nothing...

13:51.720 --> 13:54.960
Nothing, Daddy, I promise you.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.680
Bloody man.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.400
I got collateral for you from Ian,

14:03.400 --> 14:08.480
so if anything were to happen,
you wouldn't be left empty-handed.

14:08.480 --> 14:12.040
This is a deed of
gift from him to you,

14:12.040 --> 14:14.040
paintings, silver, antiques,

14:14.040 --> 14:18.320
Argyll heirlooms inherited
with the title, with the castle.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.200
All valued.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.880
But I'm not allowed to
go back to the castle.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.960
You've a right to
remove what's yours.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.160
Would you excise me for a moment?

14:49.800 --> 14:51.320
He looks so tired.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.800
You exhaust him, the mess you make.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.760
The mess that I make?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.200
Well, nobody else
makes it, do they?

15:09.800 --> 15:12.880
Well, I think it's clear whose
side you're on, isn't it, Jane?

15:14.560 --> 15:15.920
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

15:18.520 --> 15:20.040
HE WINCES

15:34.600 --> 15:37.120
It is entirely
reasonable that the Duchess

15:37.120 --> 15:40.920
be granted access
to Inveraray Castle.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.760
She must be allowed to
identify articles she claims

15:43.760 --> 15:45.120
as personal possessions.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.120
I'll allow a day, dawn till dusk.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.400
CATTLE GROAN

16:11.080 --> 16:13.000
ROOSTER CROWS

16:13.000 --> 16:15.560
It's dawn. Let's go.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.600
Hello, Satan.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.120
You fucker, Ian.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.320
What?

16:28.320 --> 16:30.600
I'm going to chop
your fucking hands off!

16:30.600 --> 16:32.720
Jesus, fucking hell.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.680
You think I'm unhinged?
I'll show you unhinged,

16:34.680 --> 16:38.720
you fucking piece of absolute shit!

16:38.720 --> 16:41.320
I'm sorry!Ah!

16:41.320 --> 16:43.960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.040
Ah!

16:46.760 --> 16:49.840
That's definitely mine. That's mine.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.480
That bedraggled thing,
I'll cheerfully leave behind.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.680
Oh, my charming wife.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.600
That reminds me,
I must move my bowels.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.600
I want all of my
clothes, Dora, everything,

16:57.600 --> 16:59.680
and if he tries to
stop you, kick him.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.840
That's mine.

17:00.840 --> 17:03.240
Shouldn't you have brought a van?

17:03.240 --> 17:06.400
I don't remove things, Ian.
I pay for people to remove things.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.720
They'll be coming later.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.240
Keep up please, Mr Jauncey.

17:09.240 --> 17:13.360
So I'm going to have to put up with
your burly labourers as well, am I?

17:13.360 --> 17:16.120
Oh, wonderful clipboard,
very debonair.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.160
Both of those are mine,
each of those.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.280
Those are mine. That's mine.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.000
And that tray there, mine. Right.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.160
That furniture's mine.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.000
Those are mine, those blue ones.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.040
That picture is...me,
it's mine. Yes, of course.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.480
Those two, that stag. That table.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.280
No, in fact those boxes are mine.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.480
That dog bed's mine.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.760
The desk is mine.
You know the desk is mine.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.120
Ashtray's mine.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.800
Ma'am, we should be
thinking about leaving.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.160
Dawn till dusk the judge said.
It's not dusk.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.280
Um...

19:17.280 --> 19:19.480
I'm never going to
be allowed here again.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.560
Just let me sit here.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.960
Please.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.320
Let me sit here.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.280
What is it?

19:59.280 --> 20:02.040
Your Grace, Malcolm Kerr,

20:02.040 --> 20:04.680
Chair of the Board of
Trustees to the Argyll Estate.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.960
Yes, I know who you are.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.200
Your Grace...

20:07.200 --> 20:11.440
Everything in there is mine,
gifted to me by the Duke.

20:11.440 --> 20:14.960
But your husband had already
used all these heirlooms

20:14.960 --> 20:16.960
to secure a personal loan.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.640
Yes.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.960
To my father.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.640
No, to another lender.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.480
This was before the Duke inherited,

20:25.480 --> 20:28.440
while he was still
with his previous wife.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.680
Sorry, I don't
understand what he's saying.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.920
He signed that to my father,
it's his signature.

20:38.920 --> 20:44.120
Yes, I thought you said your father
had taken legal advice on this?

20:44.120 --> 20:47.680
Your Grace, what we
are trying to say is

20:47.680 --> 20:53.720
that your husband cannot use these
heirlooms to secure collateral

20:53.720 --> 20:56.720
for a personal loan from your father

20:56.720 --> 21:01.520
when they've already been accepted
as collateral from another lender.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.960
This Deed of Gift is
entirely meaningless.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.680
It's, um, it's dusk.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.480
We have to go.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.120
Now.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.640
We can plan our next
move back in London.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.520
CHATTERING
Thank you gentlemen, thank you.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.880
I have been
instructed by the Duchess

21:57.880 --> 22:00.960
to file her counter
petition against the Duke

22:00.960 --> 22:04.200
for divorce on the
grounds of his adultery.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.080
Who with?

22:06.080 --> 22:08.080
Who's the other woman?

22:08.080 --> 22:10.760
Margaret, who, was it?

22:10.760 --> 22:12.160
It's my step-mother.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.160
What?! Blimey!

22:14.160 --> 22:15.480
MIXED SHOUTING

22:21.800 --> 22:24.960
There will be no, uh, further
comments at this stage.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.560
Thank you, gentlemen.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.280
George, are you out of your mind?

23:01.280 --> 23:03.320
None of it's true. None of it!

23:03.320 --> 23:06.040
He doesn't need you any more.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.120
You'd say anything to get him
all to yourself, wouldn't you?

23:09.120 --> 23:10.840
You'd say absolutely anything.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.680
Jane.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.080
You know what you did.

23:22.600 --> 23:27.280
You have a witness to your husband's
adultery with your stepmother?

23:27.280 --> 23:29.440
Yes, of course.
They're abroad at the moment.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.880
They're difficult to reach.

23:31.880 --> 23:35.840
It would be useful to speak to
them sooner rather than later.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.760
Mm-hm, of course.

23:38.760 --> 23:44.400
Your husband has cited Peter Combe
as one of the correspondents.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.000
Peter's a friend, a good friend.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.840
There's never been anything
of that nature between us.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.040
And the other names?

23:52.040 --> 23:56.480
Mr Fraser, I dine with men.

23:56.480 --> 23:59.040
I meet men, I converse with men.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.600
It doesn't follow
that I have affairs

24:00.600 --> 24:02.640
with every single man that I meet.

24:02.640 --> 24:05.480
There are only so
many hours in a day.

24:05.480 --> 24:06.600
And the image?

24:07.600 --> 24:11.320
The gentleman in the polaroid
photographs? Who is he?

24:11.320 --> 24:13.360
You're sure that nothing
that is said in court

24:13.360 --> 24:15.480
can be reported by the newspapers?

24:15.480 --> 24:17.920
Divorce is a private matter
between individuals.

24:17.920 --> 24:22.600
There's no public interest in the
painful dissolution of a marriage.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.120
Obviously press
interest will be high.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.240
Mm.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.640
Because my father is very unwell,

24:27.640 --> 24:30.560
and my children have their own lives
and I don't want to cause anybody...

24:30.560 --> 24:32.920
The details of the case and
individual testimonies

24:32.920 --> 24:36.320
cannot be reported, at least
not in the British press.

24:36.320 --> 24:37.760
They can report the judgment,

24:37.760 --> 24:40.320
though that's usually very dry.

24:42.120 --> 24:45.440
Not fodder for the front pages.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.920
He doesn't get to divorce me.

24:47.920 --> 24:52.520
I get to divorce him for cruelty...

24:52.520 --> 24:54.960
..neglect...

24:54.960 --> 24:57.040
..well, for basically being himself.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.480
This could go my way, couldn't it?

25:01.480 --> 25:04.440
There's a real chance
this could go my way.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.840
He's stolen my private property.

25:05.840 --> 25:08.360
He shouldn't be allowed
to use that against me.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.880
As evidence, the diaries and
letters are easily contested.

25:11.880 --> 25:14.120
Even the polaroid
photographs of the gentleman alone

25:14.120 --> 25:16.480
are not evidence of your adultery.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.240
However there is
the irrefutable fact of

25:19.240 --> 25:23.200
the gentleman with you...

25:23.200 --> 25:24.480
..in your bathroom.

25:29.360 --> 25:35.960
Yes, but the gentleman in
the photograph is my husband...

25:37.720 --> 25:39.080
the Duke of Argyll.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.960
He'll have to be examined
to prove he's not the man.

25:46.960 --> 25:49.840
Oh, no. How terrible for him.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.240
Help! I need help!

25:52.240 --> 25:54.040
Daddy!

25:54.040 --> 25:56.920
Call Dr Griffiths! Oh, Daddy.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.760
It's nothing. It's just a wee
tumble, and my legs went,

25:59.760 --> 26:01.120
that's all.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.800
It's all right. It's all right.

26:06.680 --> 26:08.880
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

26:24.480 --> 26:27.760
I'm so sorry, Margaret.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.160
I'll come and see him later.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.320
SHE EXHALES DEEPLY

26:45.920 --> 26:48.000
SHE BREATHES SHAKILY

26:55.480 --> 26:57.120
SHE WEEPS

27:37.840 --> 27:39.440
Hello, Margaret.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.440
Poor George.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.560
I always liked him.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.440
Lovely service.

28:02.440 --> 28:03.840
Gorgeous hymns.

28:04.880 --> 28:09.520
I stayed at the back,
I...I didn't want to intrude.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.920
You're introducing now, Maureen.

28:11.920 --> 28:15.520
It's not the best timing,
but this just won't wait.

28:16.880 --> 28:19.640
You have to stop this
ridiculous charade with Ian,

28:19.640 --> 28:22.080
that's my advice as a friend,

28:22.080 --> 28:25.360
and if you've an ounce of sense,
you'll take it.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.840
I thought all my
friends had deserted me.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.000
Do you blame them?

28:30.080 --> 28:33.320
The show that you're making
of yourself, my dear, I could weep.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.600
Didn't know you cared.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.320
I don't.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.440
But it's not just your yawning
fanny being shown to the world,

28:39.440 --> 28:41.200
it's all of ours, isn't it?

28:41.200 --> 28:43.280
Plastered all over the papers,

28:43.280 --> 28:46.880
being thumbed by every
shop girl and grocer.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.640
All nudge, nudge, wink, wink
and sniggering speculation

28:49.640 --> 28:51.360
about our class.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.000
You're breaking the rules.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.920
Our private lives stay
behind closed doors.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.920
It's why the little people
in their grubby pits

28:56.920 --> 28:58.480
look up to us because
we are not them,

28:58.480 --> 29:00.800
but you are dragging us down
so we look just like them,

29:00.800 --> 29:03.600
all bare arses and flapping cocks.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.360
Perhaps we should be dragged down.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.040
You are going to give
Ian what he wants.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.440
Give him everything.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.200
You think you're friendless now,

29:14.200 --> 29:16.440
your life will be a howling
wasteland if you don't stop,

29:16.440 --> 29:17.560
so stop.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.920
I fell 40 feet down a lift shaft.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.280
I thought I was going to die.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.440
I thought I was going
to be crushed to death.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.280
But I didn't die.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.400
Then I was told I'd
never walk again,

29:43.400 --> 29:45.640
but I walked.

29:45.640 --> 29:48.680
So don't tell me
what to do, Maureen,

29:48.680 --> 29:54.600
because I won't be told,
not by you, or Ian, or anyone.

29:54.600 --> 29:57.480
You are a Duchess.

29:58.840 --> 30:03.600
There are photographs of you with
a man's erect penis in your mouth.

30:05.280 --> 30:08.360
Did you think it was a secret?

30:08.360 --> 30:10.560
Never mind what the
scandal's doing to you,

30:10.560 --> 30:12.720
consider what it's doing to us.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.400
Floodgates open, nothing sacred.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.480
You won't be forgiven Margaret.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.080
We will close ranks
and we have ranks to close.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.520
You dear, do not.

30:30.200 --> 30:33.280
Oh, Christ, she doesn't half
choose her movements, doesn't she?

30:33.280 --> 30:35.000
Bloody freezing out there.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.960
Oh, Margaret.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.000
I'm sorry.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.480
Let's get drunk, shall we? Hey?

30:56.440 --> 30:58.760
# Mm-mm-mm-mm

30:58.760 --> 31:00.800
# Little bitty pretty one

31:00.800 --> 31:03.520
# Come on and talk-a to me

31:03.520 --> 31:05.880
# Lovey-dovey lovey one

31:05.880 --> 31:07.880
# Come sit down on my knee

31:09.560 --> 31:13.080
# Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh. #

31:14.160 --> 31:17.080
You know about
the photograph, don't you?

31:18.800 --> 31:21.600
You don't look very
surprised or shocked.

31:23.080 --> 31:26.320
You know how the rumour mill works.

31:26.320 --> 31:31.080
People are betting on who they think
it is and who you're protecting.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.840
I'm not telling you.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.000
I'm not asking.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.240
You should know me better than that.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.160
SHE SIGHS

31:48.520 --> 31:52.520
One tiny moment,
a click of a camera.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.000
That's what's on trial, really.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.840
It's not a trial, Margaret.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.800
But I got on my knees
and enjoyed it.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.680
It is a trial.

32:05.080 --> 32:09.720
And I have to be sorry, cos the law
doesn't like women who aren't sorry.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.880
Then pretend.

32:12.160 --> 32:16.440
Ian's pretending he's a sad
and wronged noble husband.

32:16.440 --> 32:19.040
You could pretend
to be good and nice.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.880
I'll have to school
my face in remorse.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.360
Go on.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.600
Let's see it.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.920
THEY LAUGH

32:27.920 --> 32:30.280
Yes, that might need some work.Mm.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.040
Do you still love him?

32:50.080 --> 32:51.240
Does he still love you?

32:55.840 --> 32:57.120
BARTENDER CLEARS THROAT

32:58.840 --> 33:00.440
Do you think he wants us to go?

33:00.440 --> 33:01.880
THEY CHUCKLE

33:03.240 --> 33:07.000
Nightcap at mine.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.800
I'm sorry for dragging you into
all this, darling, I really am.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.440
I'm grown up.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.240
I can look after myself, remember?

33:15.240 --> 33:16.600
Mm.

33:17.680 --> 33:19.680
Thank you for being my friend.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.920
Hey, don't be soft.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.520
Always.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.080
CAMERA CLICKS

33:32.680 --> 33:34.880
Bye, darling. Bye. Love you!

33:44.320 --> 33:46.560
Public hair is fascinating.

33:46.560 --> 33:49.320
Idiosyncratic as a fingerprint.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.640
I can tell my regular
clients apart by a mere clump

33:52.640 --> 33:55.280
of the downstairs fuzz.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.960
The photograph, if you please.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.240
Mm.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.760
It's not that clear, is it?

34:04.240 --> 34:06.760
KNOCKING

34:06.760 --> 34:07.840
Come.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.760
What the fuck are you doing here?

34:13.760 --> 34:16.600
We are obliged to be present
in all matters

34:16.600 --> 34:20.280
pertaining to our client's defence.

34:20.280 --> 34:21.920
Oh, Jesus Christ.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.440
Well, then, Your Grace.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.320
Release the beast.

34:33.880 --> 34:37.120
Do you see now, you see?

34:37.120 --> 34:39.200
That's why I call her Satan.

34:40.880 --> 34:43.080
I want you to tear her to shreds.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.760
HE WINCES

34:46.760 --> 34:48.520
Apologies.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.120
A little tangle.

34:50.120 --> 34:53.000
Sir, I want to remind you that
the evidence for your case

34:53.000 --> 34:55.920
is circumstantial and flimsy at best

34:55.920 --> 34:59.360
and excessively punitive
and spiteful at worst.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.480
Your wife has endured
a lot during your marriage,

35:01.480 --> 35:03.600
and I'm confident that
the way will be far kinder

35:03.600 --> 35:04.760
to her than you've been.

35:04.760 --> 35:07.840
Well, that all depends
on the view of the judge.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.440
Your wife's in pain, Your Grace.

35:24.160 --> 35:25.640
PHONE RINGS

35:33.240 --> 35:34.720
Yes?

35:34.720 --> 35:36.920
IAN: It's me.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.520
Sorry to hear about your father.
He was a good man.

35:46.040 --> 35:49.200
I've seen you look better, Margaret.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.760
Rode hard, put away wet.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.400
That's how you look.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.680
What'd you want, Ian?

35:57.960 --> 36:01.720
I thought you and I should
have a civil conversation.

36:01.720 --> 36:05.040
As fun as all this has been,
it's gone far enough.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.800
Fun?

36:06.800 --> 36:08.160
God.

36:09.560 --> 36:12.360
Do you know I think you died
in that prisoner of war camp?

36:14.120 --> 36:15.200
You died...

36:16.800 --> 36:20.160
..and this is just a corpse
that you drag around.

36:22.600 --> 36:25.200
Because you don't feel
anything at all, do you?

36:31.520 --> 36:32.640
No.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.960
I don't know if it's the
war but you're right,

36:38.960 --> 36:42.040
I don't feel anything, really.
I never have.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.800
This...

36:47.600 --> 36:51.400
..this battle between you and I...

36:51.400 --> 36:53.240
..makes the blood bang.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.320
It's the closest I
ever got to feeling alive.

37:00.840 --> 37:01.920
Sir.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.840
You cheated my father, Ian.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.800
He trusted you, and you cheated him.

37:21.800 --> 37:26.120
He wanted you to be a Duchess.
You're a Duchess.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.560
Couldn't see anything beyond that.

37:28.560 --> 37:33.000
All you ever wanted was
his money, my money,

37:33.000 --> 37:36.840
and now you've spent it all,
and you need another rich wife.

37:36.840 --> 37:39.160
I expect you've
already got one lined up.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.880
That's what this is really about.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.200
Maybe.

37:48.040 --> 37:52.640
But for the public, this will
always be about your innumerable,

37:52.640 --> 37:54.160
flagrant infidelities.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.920
Who's the chap in the
photograph by the way?

37:57.920 --> 38:00.240
I'd like to buy him a drink
and congratulate him on the...

38:00.240 --> 38:01.680
You were never faithful to me, Ian,

38:01.680 --> 38:04.000
so let's not pretend
that's who we are.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.360
Who were my mistresses?

38:06.360 --> 38:07.480
Jane, for one.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.600
Can you prove it?

38:13.560 --> 38:19.120
Do you have love letters,
diaries, a photograph?

38:19.120 --> 38:20.600
Because I do.

38:24.160 --> 38:27.280
Here's the situation as I see it,

38:27.280 --> 38:29.360
my case can be heard by a judge,

38:29.360 --> 38:32.920
at which point details I think you
would prefer to remain private

38:32.920 --> 38:35.320
will become a
matter of legal record.

38:35.320 --> 38:36.960
Or?

38:36.960 --> 38:40.560
Pay me £250,000, clear my debts,

38:40.560 --> 38:42.760
pay my lawyers, and agree
to be divorced for adultery,

38:42.760 --> 38:46.200
and then all of this
unpleasantness just goes away.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.760
You want to shame
me into submission?

38:48.760 --> 38:49.880
Yes.

38:52.680 --> 38:56.160
But at least it will be all over.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.880
But it won't be over, will it, Ian?

39:00.280 --> 39:03.600
Because there'll
just be something else,

39:03.600 --> 39:06.160
then something else,

39:06.160 --> 39:10.320
and you'll hold it over me forever.

39:10.320 --> 39:13.840
I think that that's a
risk you'll have to take.

39:24.280 --> 39:26.200
Well?

39:31.240 --> 39:32.960
See you in court.

39:42.520 --> 39:44.040
CHATTER

39:54.720 --> 39:56.160
How can it be Judge Wheatley again?

39:56.160 --> 39:58.720
Let's forget Wheatley for one
second, you have bigger issues.

39:58.720 --> 40:00.600
The photograph of you
and Peter Combe...God.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.840
I should've known that
Ian would have me watched.

40:02.840 --> 40:05.040
You said there was nothing
between you and Mr Combe.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.120
And there isn't.
Peter will swear to it.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.520
How is Ian allowed
to spy on me like that?

40:09.520 --> 40:13.120
All parties in Argyll
versus Argyll. All parties.

40:13.120 --> 40:16.120
You have to drop the
counter-claim against him.

40:16.120 --> 40:18.000
We have no evidence
about your step-mother.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.320
I know that Jane and
Ian had an affair.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.320
Without evidence,
it's just speculation.

40:23.320 --> 40:27.440
You have to drop it. You have to.
Before we start.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.480
Court rise.

41:04.480 --> 41:08.120
Dr Tulloch, a material piece of
evidence against the Duchess

41:08.120 --> 41:11.680
is a polaroid photograph.
You've seen this photograph?

41:11.680 --> 41:15.680
I have. I studied it for
professional comparison.

41:15.680 --> 41:18.520
My Lord, the Defender claims
that the man in the photograph

41:18.520 --> 41:19.760
is her husband.

41:19.760 --> 41:22.240
Dr Tulloch, you examined the Duke
to establish if this was so.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.600
I did.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.280
I observed all the distributions

41:25.280 --> 41:28.000
of the suprapubic hair formation.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.560
The man in the polaroid
photograph has a thick,

41:30.560 --> 41:33.760
bushy growth that extends
towards the umbilicus.

41:33.760 --> 41:37.160
The Duke, in contrast,
has a very thin and fine

41:37.160 --> 41:38.920
suprapubic distribution.

41:38.920 --> 41:41.080
So what did you
conclude from this clearly

41:41.080 --> 41:43.800
experienced
professional examination?

41:43.800 --> 41:47.120
That the person in the photograph
was different from the Duke.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.960
Different.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.680
Not her husband.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.040
Thank you, Dr Tulloch.

41:55.040 --> 41:58.120
How would you describe your
relationship with the Defender?

42:00.360 --> 42:02.480
The Duchess and I are friends.

42:02.480 --> 42:08.280
We go for dinner, walk our dogs
together, go to the cinema.

42:08.280 --> 42:10.000
I make her laugh.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.400
She's needed that during her
marriage, someone to make her laugh.

42:14.400 --> 42:17.640
The pursuer has a photograph of you
and the Defender

42:17.640 --> 42:21.800
embracing on her doorstep in
the early hours of the morning.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.800
Yes, he does.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.720
Have you at any time
in your friendship

42:26.720 --> 42:29.760
been intimately
involved with the Defender?

42:29.760 --> 42:31.240
Never.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.840
No, we've never once
been adulterous.

42:33.840 --> 42:36.480
It's not even a remote possibility.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.880
We're friends.

42:37.880 --> 42:40.600
That embrace is the embrace that
friends give each other.

42:45.080 --> 42:48.040
INDISTINCT CHATTER

42:54.880 --> 42:57.880
My lord, I have a letter from
the Duke's physician declaring that

42:57.880 --> 43:01.840
the Duke suffers from a condition
that requires him to sit.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.040
I will allow.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.840
Yes, my wife frequently went out in
London unaccompanied by me.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.560
Sometimes she returned at midnight,

43:16.560 --> 43:19.240
sometimes at three or four o'clock
in the morning.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.360
She said she was with friends.

43:21.360 --> 43:23.720
And were you entirely happy
about that?

43:23.720 --> 43:25.400
No.

43:25.400 --> 43:26.960
All of her friends were men.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.880
She assured me it was all
completely innocent.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.360
And you believed her?

43:33.360 --> 43:35.000
Of course.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.160
But then my suspicions
became overwhelming.

43:38.160 --> 43:41.840
I moved out of our London home
into Claridge's Hotel,

43:41.840 --> 43:45.360
then after that I discovered
her letters,

43:45.360 --> 43:50.920
diaries and other things
that she kept secretly.

43:50.920 --> 43:54.040
And did you notice anything
in her diaries that took your

43:54.040 --> 43:56.960
attention particularly?

43:56.960 --> 43:59.400
A list of names and dates,

43:59.400 --> 44:00.760
names of men.

44:04.440 --> 44:06.360
And the letter V.

44:06.360 --> 44:10.080
And what does the Defender signify
with the use of the letter V?

44:13.640 --> 44:17.200
She... She signifies...

44:17.200 --> 44:19.040
..that intercourse occurred.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.760
GASPS

44:20.760 --> 44:23.280
How can you be so sure?

44:23.280 --> 44:26.960
Because it appears next
to my own name,

44:26.960 --> 44:31.000
in the early years of our marriage,

44:31.000 --> 44:32.440
when we were happy.

44:37.520 --> 44:41.080
You had intercourse with
the Defender when you were married

44:41.080 --> 44:42.920
to your previous wife.

44:42.920 --> 44:45.040
You committed adultery.

44:45.040 --> 44:48.560
I did so for the purposes
of obtaining a divorce.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.000
I see.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.880
You are practised in
calculation when it comes

44:52.880 --> 44:55.400
to obtaining a divorce.

44:55.400 --> 45:00.760
You say you left the London home
and took a suite at Claridge's,

45:00.760 --> 45:04.920
but you were reconciled with
the Defender in Paris.

45:04.920 --> 45:08.040
You shared the same room,
the same bed.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.000
Briefly.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.640
Briefly or not,

45:12.640 --> 45:16.520
at that time you condoned
what you suspected.

45:16.520 --> 45:19.000
My wife is very persuasive.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.440
There were nights at Inveraray
when I had to lock myself in

45:21.440 --> 45:23.240
the library in order
to get some sleep,

45:23.240 --> 45:25.480
and even then she would batter
on the door.

45:25.480 --> 45:26.560
LAUGHTER

45:26.560 --> 45:28.760
But you seemed prepared
to accept all that

45:28.760 --> 45:31.680
when the Defender paid for
your scheme to salvage

45:31.680 --> 45:33.840
a shipwreck from Tobermory Bay

45:33.840 --> 45:36.640
and the restoration of
Inveraray Castle.

45:36.640 --> 45:39.360
I put it to you that you only
began to care about

45:39.360 --> 45:43.240
the Defender's London lifestyle when
her money began to dry up.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.760
No, not at all.

45:44.760 --> 45:48.200
You weren't angry when the Defender
refused you money?

45:48.200 --> 45:49.240
No.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.720
You didn't physically attack her?

45:50.720 --> 45:52.600
There were no occasions of violence?

45:52.600 --> 45:53.720
No, and no.

45:53.720 --> 45:56.360
You didn't, with the help of
your daughter,

45:56.360 --> 45:59.280
terrorise the Defender by
holding her down in her bed

45:59.280 --> 46:00.840
and stealing her diary?

46:00.840 --> 46:02.280
I didn't terrorise her.

46:02.280 --> 46:07.360
I merely took her diary from her
bedside table as she reached for

46:07.360 --> 46:09.480
the telephone to call the police.

46:09.480 --> 46:11.640
My daughter Lady Jeanne will agree.

46:11.640 --> 46:13.080
I'm sure.

46:15.280 --> 46:17.600
You drink, don't you?

46:17.600 --> 46:19.440
You drink to excess.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I drink the usual amount.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
I put it to you that you drink to
a degree that would influence

46:32.000 --> 46:36.720
a man's behaviour, his judgment,
his state of mind

46:36.720 --> 46:40.800
and would cause his wife to stress
even as she did everything

46:40.800 --> 46:43.200
in her power... My wife...
..to care and support.

46:43.200 --> 46:46.840
My wife, the Defender,

46:46.840 --> 46:48.480
is unfaithful.

46:50.080 --> 46:52.480
And I drink the usual amount.

46:58.040 --> 47:01.040
SHOUTING

47:05.000 --> 47:06.680
You're scum! Slut!

47:24.680 --> 47:27.600
In the matter of Argyll
versus Argyll,

47:27.600 --> 47:30.880
the court now calls
Margaret, Duchess of Argyll.

47:45.280 --> 47:49.080
What purpose do your diaries serve?

47:49.080 --> 47:52.000
They're a record of
my social engagements.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.680
People who've written dinner
invitations. Parties.

47:55.680 --> 47:59.800
The letter V your husband
alleges is a symbol

47:59.800 --> 48:02.720
for intercourse...

48:02.720 --> 48:06.760
..is a shorthand for these social
engagements, an aide-memoire?

48:06.760 --> 48:10.160
Yes. People who sent flowers,
for example.

48:10.160 --> 48:13.160
And the love letters?

48:13.160 --> 48:16.200
Those are from before my marriage.

48:16.200 --> 48:18.760
Many women keep such letters.

48:18.760 --> 48:21.480
They can be comforting,

48:21.480 --> 48:23.560
especially if one's unhappy.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.800
You were unhappy with your husband?

48:25.800 --> 48:28.600
I wanted very much to be happy.

48:28.600 --> 48:31.080
I tried to make my husband happy,

48:31.080 --> 48:34.400
but he was volatile and neglectful

48:34.400 --> 48:37.040
and I was very lonely.

48:39.240 --> 48:44.160
I must ask you about an explicit
polaroid photograph.

48:44.160 --> 48:46.360
You said the man was your husband.

48:46.360 --> 48:48.640
I thought it must be.

48:48.640 --> 48:51.360
He did keep material of that nature.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.480
It was his fetish.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.480
MURMURING

48:53.480 --> 48:56.480
And the woman in the image,
is that you?

48:56.480 --> 48:58.320
Might I see it?

48:58.320 --> 48:59.480
Of course.

49:09.120 --> 49:12.000
Sorry, but this image is so faded

49:12.000 --> 49:14.640
it's impossible for me
to say who that woman is.

49:19.760 --> 49:20.840
Your Grace,

49:20.840 --> 49:25.480
you husband alleges that you have
had adulterous liaisons

49:25.480 --> 49:27.760
with over 80 men.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.360
Have you ever been unfaithful
to your husband?

49:31.960 --> 49:34.160
No, never.

49:41.680 --> 49:44.840
M'lord, the Defender has been
standing for hours.

49:44.840 --> 49:47.320
Might she be perhaps
permitted a chair?

49:47.320 --> 49:49.840
The Defender will remain standing.

49:52.040 --> 49:54.160
Mr Emslie.

49:54.160 --> 49:57.080
My husband was allowed to sit.

49:57.080 --> 50:00.640
The Defender will restrict
her remarks to what is germane.

50:00.640 --> 50:02.480
Mr Emslie, please proceed.

50:06.760 --> 50:09.160
Your Grace,

50:09.160 --> 50:11.760
I would like to ask you about
the love letters.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.560
You say they were innocent?

50:13.560 --> 50:15.800
I say they were sent
before my marriage.

50:15.800 --> 50:19.520
And you kept them because
they were...

50:19.520 --> 50:20.960
..comforting?

50:20.960 --> 50:22.400
Yes.

50:22.400 --> 50:25.040
My Lord, a letter to the Defender.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.320
"My love.

50:28.320 --> 50:33.480
"My tongue feels dry and violent
upsurges shake my body.

50:33.480 --> 50:35.600
"I can hardly wait,

50:35.600 --> 50:38.880
"so much am I filled with
visions of you,

50:38.880 --> 50:42.640
"memories and others which
will become truth soon."

50:43.560 --> 50:44.960
Well, goodness me,

50:44.960 --> 50:48.520
are violent upsurges comforting?

50:48.520 --> 50:51.000
Comforting for most women
would be a...

50:51.000 --> 50:53.680
Well, a kind word.

50:53.680 --> 50:56.040
Not a violent upsurge.

50:59.680 --> 51:02.720
That letter was sent to me before
I married the Duke.

51:02.720 --> 51:04.400
Yes, the court heard you say that.

51:04.400 --> 51:10.160
The court also heard that
Peter Combe is just a friend.

51:10.160 --> 51:11.280
He is.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.600
Well, then I would like
your explanation for this,

51:13.600 --> 51:16.320
the photograph of Peter Combe
leaving your house in

51:16.320 --> 51:17.760
the early hours of the morning,

51:17.760 --> 51:21.440
and you embrace very lovingly,
in public.

51:21.440 --> 51:24.280
M'lord, Mr Combe has already
testified with respect

51:24.280 --> 51:26.680
to his friendship with
the Defender.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.600
I'll allow.

51:29.600 --> 51:32.720
What was Peter Combe doing
with you until the early hours of

51:32.720 --> 51:35.400
the morning that should occasion
such a, erm...

51:37.640 --> 51:39.200
..warm embrace?

51:39.200 --> 51:40.560
We were talking.

51:41.920 --> 51:43.360
That's all.

51:43.360 --> 51:46.080
We played music, we talked.

51:46.080 --> 51:48.880
And I embraced him because
he's my good friend.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.440
What is V?

51:55.040 --> 51:56.480
I've already said.

51:56.480 --> 52:00.480
It's a record of my social
engagements, an aide-memoire.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.920
V is your cypher for
intercourse, isn't it?

52:02.920 --> 52:05.680
You like to keep trophies
of your conquests -

52:05.680 --> 52:07.560
letters, photographs.

52:07.560 --> 52:10.560
V is sexual conquest.

52:10.560 --> 52:13.920
And it is everywhere
in your diaries.

52:13.920 --> 52:18.040
"V, V, V, V, V..."

52:18.040 --> 52:19.960
No, no, no.

52:19.960 --> 52:21.680
It's nothing to do with that.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.000
Well, then what is it?

52:24.000 --> 52:26.040
Because it isn't, erm...

52:27.920 --> 52:29.680
..flowers.

52:34.440 --> 52:35.560
It's private.

52:35.560 --> 52:36.680
Private?

52:36.680 --> 52:39.400
Innocent, like the violent upsurges?

52:42.400 --> 52:45.200
Do you know the difference
between the truth and a lie?

52:45.200 --> 52:46.960
Yes, I do.

52:46.960 --> 52:50.240
And I've heard my husband lie
in this court.

52:50.240 --> 52:52.960
This action brought by my husband,
it's not merely about divorce.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.880
He doesn't care about infidelities,
he doesn't care about affairs.

52:55.880 --> 52:57.880
The only thing he cares about
is destroying me.

52:57.880 --> 52:59.840
He wants nothing less than
my total ruination

52:59.840 --> 53:01.760
and all I've ever tried
to do is help him.

53:01.760 --> 53:04.040
And yet you lied constantly
throughout your marriage.

53:04.040 --> 53:06.520
You lied about the paternity
of your husband's sons

53:06.520 --> 53:09.160
and, for what I can only imagine
is good measure, defamed

53:09.160 --> 53:11.360
the moral character of their mother.

53:11.360 --> 53:13.000
You lied about your own stepmother,

53:13.000 --> 53:14.480
the most egregious lies.

53:14.480 --> 53:18.000
You claimed that she and your
husband were "having an affair."

53:18.000 --> 53:20.600
You are a liar, aren't you?

53:20.600 --> 53:23.120
You're lying now about your lovers
and you are lying about

53:23.120 --> 53:25.640
the polaroid photograph because,
as this court has shown,

53:25.640 --> 53:29.320
the man in the photograph is not
your husband, as you claimed.

53:29.320 --> 53:36.280
But the woman in the photograph,
that is you, isn't it?

53:55.880 --> 54:00.640
Yes, it's me.

53:55.880 --> 54:00.640
MURMURING

54:00.640 --> 54:02.720
JUDGE BANGS GAVEL

54:02.720 --> 54:05.280
Those are my pearls. That's my ring.

54:06.720 --> 54:08.720
That's my bathroom.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.320
That woman is me.

54:13.880 --> 54:16.040
Well, well.

54:17.640 --> 54:19.360
There we are, then.

54:19.360 --> 54:24.760
I believe I'm not the only one
to have no further questions.

54:24.760 --> 54:26.920
The Defender may step down.

54:36.640 --> 54:41.120
In this application for divorce on
the grounds of adultery,

54:41.120 --> 54:44.800
I have considered the evidence
and testimonies of both

54:44.800 --> 54:48.440
Pursuer, Ian Campbell,
Duke of Argyll,

54:48.440 --> 54:52.360
and the Defender, Margaret Campbell,
Duchess of Argyll.

54:52.360 --> 54:55.240
Concerning the Duchess,

54:55.240 --> 54:59.000
I consider her to be
a highly-sexed woman, who had

54:59.000 --> 55:02.480
ceased to be satisfied with
normal relations

55:02.480 --> 55:07.000
and had started to indulge
in disgusting sexual activities

55:07.000 --> 55:11.440
to gratify a debased
sexual appetite.

55:11.440 --> 55:14.640
Evidence was supplied in
the form of diaries,

55:14.640 --> 55:18.000
letters and Polaroid photographs.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.160
The man or men depicted cannot be
identified as the angle

55:22.160 --> 55:25.280
of the images exclude the head.

55:25.280 --> 55:29.160
And that the Defender and the man or
men depicted were indulging in

55:29.160 --> 55:32.880
a gross form of
sexual relationship.

55:32.880 --> 55:37.440
There is enough in her own
few admissions and proven facts

55:37.440 --> 55:41.160
to establish that she was
a completely promiscuous woman,

55:41.160 --> 55:46.120
whose sexual appetite could only
be satisfied with a number of men,

55:46.120 --> 55:50.760
whose promiscuity had led to
a queer form of perversion

55:50.760 --> 55:54.400
and whose attitude to the sanctity
of marriage was what

55:54.400 --> 55:58.200
the moderns might call sophisticated
but what in plain language

55:58.200 --> 56:01.680
could only be described
as wholly immoral.

56:01.680 --> 56:04.400
I find that the Duchess
has committed adultery

56:04.400 --> 56:05.880
with several men,

56:05.880 --> 56:09.480
including the man or men in
the Polaroid photographs.

56:09.480 --> 56:13.720
But I grant the Duke his divorce on
the grounds of his wife's adultery

56:13.720 --> 56:15.600
with Peter Combe.

56:15.600 --> 56:18.520
The Duke will pay one eighth
of the expense,

56:18.520 --> 56:21.040
the Duchess to pay the rest.

57:00.040 --> 57:04.960
Did he marry you for love
or for money?

57:04.960 --> 57:07.360
I...I don't know.

57:07.360 --> 57:10.760
I simply don't know.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.240
I knew I loved him.

57:12.240 --> 57:15.600
I knew I wanted to save Inveraray,

57:15.600 --> 57:18.040
desperately badly.

57:18.040 --> 57:20.040
What he felt, I don't know.

MUSIC: You're The Top

57:26.880 --> 57:29.000
# You're the top
