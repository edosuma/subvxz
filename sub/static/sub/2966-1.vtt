01:27.040 --> 01:30.089
<i>As long as I can remember,
I've had hemorrhoids.</i>

01:30.280 --> 01:33.090
<i>And I 've thought for many years,
I shouldn't tell this .</i>

01:33.280 --> 01:35.567
<i>Because hemorrhoids
only grow with Grandpa's .</i>

01:35.920 --> 01:38.571
<i>I thought them to be a
very ungirly thing .</i>

02:07.440 --> 02:10.283
Zinc ointment helps
against the outer itching.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.842
<i>A hazelnut-sized amount
on the finger with the shortest nail.</i>

02:16.440 --> 02:20.331
<i>Then, rub it on the cauliflower,
that proliferates down there .</i>

02:23.120 --> 02:28.251
<i>One can also introduce the ointment anal,
to still the itching on the inside.</i>

03:55.240 --> 03:57.846
<i>My mother has told me,
that it is difficult,</i>

03:58.040 --> 04:00.281
<i>to keep a pussy really clean.</i>

04:00.520 --> 04:03.922
<i>A pussy gets sick
a lot easier than a penis.</i>

04:04.120 --> 04:07.044
That is why hygiene in the bathroom
has the top priority.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.961
<i>Helen, are you ready?
Is everything is fresh again?</i>

04:11.160 --> 04:12.160
Almost.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.760
<i>Come on</i>

04:59.160 --> 05:00.446
Jump.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.845
Trust no one.
Not even your parents.

05:22.440 --> 05:26.729
It' s better to have a scratched knee now,
than to have a broken heart later on.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.081
<i>With a lot of things,
that were taught me,</i>

05:33.280 --> 05:36.045
<i>I do not agree .</i>

05:36.400 --> 05:37.765
<i>So I subjected myself</i>

05:38.120 --> 05:40.964
<i>to a living pusssy
hygiene self-experiment.</i>

05:41.160 --> 05:43.208
<i>At a public toilet
my mother pees</i>

05:43.400 --> 05:45.323
<i>in a floating squatting position.</i>

05:45.560 --> 05:50.566
<i>I take a lot of pleasure from seating
myself fully on the dirty toilet seat .</i>

05:51.280 --> 05:55.080
<i>Then, I wipe the seat clean
with my pussy, in a neat circle.</i>

05:55.280 --> 05:58.045
<i>The dirtier the toilet,
the better.</i>

05:58.680 --> 06:01.126
<i>I' ve done this experiment
for many years,</i>

06:01.320 --> 06:03.800
<i>and I 've never
had a single mushroom .</i>

06:04.640 --> 06:07.325
<i>I have a very healthy
pussy flora.</i>

06:11.760 --> 06:14.331
<i>Hygiene is a lowercase
word to me.</i>

06:15.720 --> 06:18.405
<i>One shouldn' t wash one' s
pussy too much.</i>

06:20.040 --> 06:24.762
<i>My goal is that it can be smelt easily and
seductively right through the pants .</i>

06:26.320 --> 06:29.369
<i>Men will then
percieve this, unconsciously,</i>

06:29.600 --> 06:32.604
<i>because we are all animals so,
who want to mate .</i>

06:34.120 --> 06:37.602
<i>Preferably with people
who smell of pussy.</i>

06:40.800 --> 06:42.290
Are you hungry?

06:43.360 --> 06:47.046
<i>The consistency of the pussy-mucus
plays a major role.</i>

06:47.240 --> 06:49.402
<i>It is always different.</i>

06:49.640 --> 06:52.689
<i>Sometimes like olive oil,
today more like cottage cheese.</i>

06:52.880 --> 06:54.769
<i>Many strongly prefer cottage cheese.</i>

06:54.960 --> 06:57.770
<i>You may not believe me.
But it's true.</i>

07:01.880 --> 07:02.961
Taste alright?

07:14.840 --> 07:17.411
- Can I take a picture of you?
- Now?

07:17.640 --> 07:18.640
Yes.

07:26.920 --> 07:30.003
Thank you.
Looks good.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.010
As if you' re dying.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.684
<i>My sex-souvenir candy .</i>

07:56.520 --> 08:00.730
<i>If you find dicks, sperm and
other bodily fluids disgusting,</i>

08:00.920 --> 08:03.810
<i>it's better just to
leave sex alone.</i>

08:04.000 --> 08:06.048
<i>That, for sure, is not
my intention .</i>

09:14.400 --> 09:18.371
Cooking me something? - Nope,
I just borrowed the vegetables.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.728
<i>That's Toni, my brother.</i>

09:20.920 --> 09:23.241
<i>As a baby he was always
yapping about .</i>

09:23.440 --> 09:28.446
<i>But today he says nothing.
Well, only if you touch his teddy bear .</i>

09:28.680 --> 09:30.045
Stop it now!

09:31.200 --> 09:33.123
<i>Everyone needs hobbies.</i>

09:33.320 --> 09:36.642
<i>For me, besides fucking,
it' s growing avocado trees .</i>

09:36.840 --> 09:39.810
<i>The seeds are my
own little family .</i>

09:42.440 --> 09:45.410
<i>That's mama.
She has tried every religious</i>

09:45.640 --> 09:48.405
<i>and spiritual thing there is.</i>

09:48.920 --> 09:50.445
Hallelujah!

09:57.840 --> 09:59.171
<i>After the divorce</i>

09:59.360 --> 10:03.365
<i>she has gone for the most bizarre religion
of them all.</i>

10:03.760 --> 10:04.966
<i>Catholicism.</i>

10:11.920 --> 10:15.049
<i>Amen </i>!

10:23.080 --> 10:25.970
- Hi.
- Oh, hi . Neighbors.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.129
Great.
- I'm Corinna.

10:28.520 --> 10:32.525
Bye, Corinna.
- Helen, don't be so rude.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.041
It 's not worth it,
get to know us, you know?

10:37.400 --> 10:40.131
Because soon my mother will
wink at the next guy.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.243
And we move away again.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.408
It' s not that bad.
- Still is though.

10:44.800 --> 10:49.089
- Yeah, men are not that easy.
- We need to be off again.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.602
Otherwise my vegetarian
roast will burn.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.609
You can take your
mom over sometimes.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.371
Right.
We' ll invite all of her ex-lovers.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.285
Then we have a really
cozy gangbang evening.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.569
See you soon, take care.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.360
Bye.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.240
Why do you emberass us like that?
What will people think of us?

11:07.360 --> 11:10.887
<i>I have no idea,
what Corinna thought about us.</i>

11:11.240 --> 11:13.766
<i>I just know that she will soon
be my best friend .</i>

11:13.960 --> 11:18.727
<i>And that she had a knack for
always picking the wrong types.</i>

11:25.160 --> 11:29.006
<i>Her last boyfriend was the drummer
in a heavy metal band .</i>

11:34.040 --> 11:36.566
<i>As Corinna would soon find out</i>

11:36.760 --> 11:40.731
<i>the drummer had a very special fondness
during sex .</i>

11:44.960 --> 11:46.610
I love you.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.601
I love you too.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.208
Can you poop on my stomach?

11:54.600 --> 11:55.600
What?

12:25.760 --> 12:27.364
<i>Corinna did her best .</i>

12:27.600 --> 12:31.446
<i>But the worst was that thereafter
everybody knew about it .</i>

13:30.720 --> 13:31.720
Papa?

13:41.640 --> 13:42.640
Papa?

13:43.680 --> 13:45.409
Can I live with you?

14:08.960 --> 14:10.849
Your eggs are burnt.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.731
Hey,
why don' t you ring the doorbell?

14:21.920 --> 14:22.921
<i>My dad.</i>

14:23.120 --> 14:25.600
<i>He often hurts me a lot,
without realizing it .</i>

14:42.320 --> 14:44.926
<i>To dance so uninhibited
you' ve got</i>

14:45.120 --> 14:47.851
<i>to have a lot of money.
Or a big penis .</i>

14:48.200 --> 14:50.123
<i>Or both, like my father.</i>

15:11.520 --> 15:16.048
<i>As a child of divorce I hope,
as do almost all children of divorce,</i>

15:16.240 --> 15:18.368
<i>for my parents to get back together.</i>

15:18.600 --> 15:19.601
<i>Why?</i>

15:19.800 --> 15:23.043
<i>Because every child loves
his parents unconditionally.</i>

15:23.240 --> 15:25.720
<i>Whether they deserve it or not.</i>

15:25.920 --> 15:27.649
Are you dreaming?

15:28.200 --> 15:29.690
No, I 'm thinking.

15:29.880 --> 15:30.880
Abraham!

15:32.200 --> 15:35.363
- Here I am.
- Take your son, Isaac,

15:35.600 --> 15:37.682
and take him there. as a burnt offering

15:37.880 --> 15:40.167
- Father?
- Yes, my son?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.649
Here is fire and wood.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.684
But where is the lamb,
we wanted to sacrifice?

15:46.040 --> 15:48.441
God will choose the sacrificial lamb,
my son.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.810
What are you thinking about?

15:53.800 --> 15:55.962
How it' ll be when you're old.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.369
Ah yes?
- Uh-huh.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.762
And how would it be?
Good or what?

16:02.520 --> 16:03.885
Do you feel old?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.801
I do not want to talk about it.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.129
Do you understand?
- Uh-huh.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.324
I mean you' re old already,
but I mean really old.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.446
Are you afraid
that I' d die soon?

16:28.760 --> 16:30.250
Do not be afraid.

16:31.800 --> 16:35.600
No. I mean, if you
are old and in need of care.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.281
And I have to wash your ass.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.845
I' d do this at home,
within the family circle.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.165
What do you think?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.331
I find it...

16:50.520 --> 16:51.681
nice. All right.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.971
And her I' d stuff
in a nursing home.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.526
And about me?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.890
I'll lay you down
in the same bed as mom.

17:18.280 --> 17:19.805
Until you die.

17:21.599 --> 17:26.242
You'd tie me to the bed with your
father, until I die?

17:31.320 --> 17:34.563
After all
this man has done to me?

17:36.360 --> 17:37.360
Yes.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.961
How come you want to
punish me like that?

17:43.400 --> 17:44.925
Punish?

17:52.800 --> 17:55.610
<i>Sometimes,
I just have to wait patiently,</i>

17:55.800 --> 17:57.564
<i>it' s in my hands .</i>

19:21.880 --> 19:24.963
<i>Since I really
don't like shaving</i>

19:25.160 --> 19:27.766
<i>I always do it
too fast and too hard .</i>

19:31.640 --> 19:34.405
<i>To me, the ass belongs
to the domain of sex.</i>

19:34.640 --> 19:38.201
<i>So it is subjected to
this modern shaving-duty as well.</i>

19:40.600 --> 19:43.331
<i>Perhaps not everyone knows
what an anal fissure is .</i>

19:43.560 --> 19:47.167
<i>This is a small,
small crack in the anus.</i>

19:47.360 --> 19:50.603
<i>And you can get it easily.
For example, when shaving .</i>

19:52.640 --> 19:57.089
<i>This causes me one of
the greatest pains I 've ever had.</i>

20:26.680 --> 20:28.330
Ahhh ...!

20:32.200 --> 20:34.726
Hello, my sweetheart.
- Hello.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.726
Is everything okay?

20:37.080 --> 20:38.445
Mhm.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.091
Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.362
Did you smoke weed?

20:42.600 --> 20:43.600
Okay.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.043
<i>The swollen hemorrhoids</i>

20:48.240 --> 20:51.130
<i>are now pressing full force
against my shaving injury,</i>

20:51.320 --> 20:53.527
<i>and let the fissure
tear ever further .</i>

21:24.880 --> 21:29.363
<i>On the ass-injury, a
bulging blister has formed,</i>

21:29.600 --> 21:31.648
<i>which hangs out of the anus,</i>

21:31.840 --> 21:34.650
<i>like the neck skin
of these tropical birds,</i>

21:35.000 --> 21:38.641
<i>when during mating season
they pump a lot of air into it.</i>

21:43.040 --> 21:47.090
<i>It must look very inflamed.
All who come in say...</i>

21:47.440 --> 21:49.090
Ohh!

21:53.680 --> 21:56.160
I'm Doctor Notz.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.607
Ahhh!

21:58.400 --> 22:00.801
Oh!
- Warn me first, please!

22:01.160 --> 22:02.650
Damn!

22:03.880 --> 22:05.120
What was that?

22:05.800 --> 22:07.211
That was my thumb.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.362
Do you always introduce
yourself like that?

22:11.760 --> 22:13.842
Yes I do, imagine that.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.882
No. First of all, with that thick
bubble in place I can' t see a thing.

22:19.080 --> 22:22.607
And secondly, it presses against
the skin lesions and hurts you.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.804
And now it no longer hurts.
That's quite a success.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.322
So, gentlemen,
what's to be done here?

22:28.560 --> 22:31.211
I think operate,
Professor. - I didn' t ask you yet.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.370
- Rocco.
- I' d suggest it as well.

22:34.600 --> 22:39.003
Surgery? Yes, operate. But right away,
right? Nils?

22:39.200 --> 22:40.201
Definitely.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.682
Have you already eaten
anything this morning? - No.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.240
Eaten nothing, drank nothing?
- No.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.040
Out of sheer pain
I have not eaten anything.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.763
Wonderful, then we apply
general anesthesia . Why? Michael.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.605
- An awkward silence.
- Yes.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.088
Which spares us the everlasting chatter.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.441
Alright then.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.720
We 'll see you later,
looking forward to it, bye.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.885
And whate exactly do you do
in the operating room?

23:09.080 --> 23:12.368
In the OR we cut
the inflamed tissue

23:12.600 --> 23:14.568
around the skin lesion
out in a wedge-shape.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.011
Okay.
- Good.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.807
Can you draw it for me?
I can' t imagine it..

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Uh...

23:31.120 --> 23:33.851
So the circle represents your behind.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.691
The circle is my anus.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.562
Oooaaahhh!

23:41.880 --> 23:45.441
You have to
read these documents.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.205
And sign at the end.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.928
It says something about incontinence.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.250
What does that have to do with pee?

23:52.760 --> 23:55.923
This is anal incontinence.
- Never heard of it.

23:57.760 --> 24:01.924
Ah, that means I can no
longer close my sphincter.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.647
And shit will just run right out of me.
- Right.

24:04.840 --> 24:08.322
You' ll need a diaper then.
- Exactly.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.562
But happens relatively rarely.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.610
So, will you sign here?

24:13.520 --> 24:16.364
I can' t really operate
myself at home.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.568
Right, Valerie?

24:18.920 --> 24:19.920
That's right.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.404
<i>That' s where it got me now.</i>

24:23.640 --> 24:25.608
Shit, man.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.723
<i>All the fault of a Ladyshave.</i>

24:28.360 --> 24:31.569
<i>Actually I shave myself
only because of Kanell .</i>

24:32.320 --> 24:36.928
<i>If I had not met him,
this would not have happened .</i>

24:54.440 --> 24:56.568
- Are you shaven?
- What?

24:58.440 --> 24:59.851
Whether you've shaved.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.410
No, why do you ask?

25:03.720 --> 25:06.530
Because I would like to
shave you sometime.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.010
Here is my address.

25:11.760 --> 25:15.321
<i>This is one of my most
spontaneous dates for sures.</i>

27:11.160 --> 27:14.289
So I don' t get callous skin
on my knees.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.728
Want to fuck me now?

28:29.200 --> 28:31.123
But you are too young.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.200
Too bad.

28:37.440 --> 28:38.440
Get dressed.

28:54.280 --> 28:56.760
Helen, hi.
I'm Robin, the nurse.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.685
I've got some news for you,

29:04.280 --> 29:07.124
we' ve managed to plan your
operation real soon.

29:11.520 --> 29:15.570
So, you are operated on the anus,
a very unsanitary place.

29:15.760 --> 29:19.321
Actually, the most unhygienic
of the whole body.

29:19.720 --> 29:23.247
Just the coat, please.
You need to bare it all.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.090
Completely naked?
- Exactly.

29:25.960 --> 29:26.960
Problem?

29:27.120 --> 29:28.201
Yes.
- Why?

29:28.800 --> 29:31.121
I think that's just awful.

29:32.320 --> 29:35.244
They all just talk about
what you look like.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.286
Oh, these are all professionals.
- Yes, of course . Professionals.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.648
I can hear what they're
talking about.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.649
In my subconscious.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.648
Then I' ll go crazy,

29:51.280 --> 29:53.886
in a few years,
and no one knows why.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.561
Uh, the...

29:58.240 --> 29:59.685
the skirt as well.
- Ah.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.001
Yes, it does some patients like that.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.200
Mhm.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.120
Okay.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.370
Excited?
- Yes.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
Very good.

30:32.360 --> 30:36.570
What are you writing about?
- A list of my hobbies.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.364
I have to think over,

30:38.760 --> 30:41.525
what I' ll sacrifice to
God non-existent,

30:41.720 --> 30:44.405
so that he' ll spare me
anal incontinence.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.206
Okay.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.448
And what do you want to offer him?

30:49.240 --> 30:50.401
Point 2

30:51.120 --> 30:52.326
Or point 3

30:53.360 --> 30:55.601
Drugs or hookers.

30:58.960 --> 31:02.407
Yes, that's good.
- That's a great sacrifice, I think.

31:02.640 --> 31:05.086
Here's a sedative for you.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.806
This makes the transition to
general anesthesia soft and supple.

31:08.520 --> 31:09.520
Here.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.924
That hit my uvula hard.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.807
Mine is quite sensitive.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.128
I know that from cock sucking.

31:24.320 --> 31:26.607
When they poke real
deep, you know?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.882
Classic.
- Yeah, or something.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.529
Has your girlfriend got
gagging problems as well?

31:36.880 --> 31:40.123
Uh, no, she doesn' t do
oral sex that much.

31:40.320 --> 31:42.971
Too bad.
- Yeah, I thinks so as well.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.081
What do you think so as well?

31:47.600 --> 31:48.726
Nothing.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.844
We are talking about
an undersupply of oral sex.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.400
Aw.

31:53.600 --> 31:54.647
Mhm.

31:56.920 --> 31:57.920
How nice.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.201
Valerie!

32:14.680 --> 32:16.569
Girlfriend?
- Well,

32:16.920 --> 32:19.890
we 're having
a kind of relationship break.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.367
Wow.
For how long?

32:25.280 --> 32:26.406
Two years.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.965
All right.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.160
Here.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.325
So can I call you someone?

32:36.680 --> 32:37.680
Your parents?

32:38.240 --> 32:39.240
No.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.409
My parents died tragically.

32:44.280 --> 32:45.280
Really?

32:46.600 --> 32:48.409
Could these eyes lie?

32:49.920 --> 32:50.967
I think so.

32:53.160 --> 32:54.160
Right.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.121
Very well in fact.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.688
Okay, come over here.
- What is it?

33:08.880 --> 33:10.689
Where is the ball-point pen?

33:10.880 --> 33:13.451
You will call
my parents, okay? - Yes.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.844
That' s dad.
- Yes.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.290
And that's mom.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.323
They have to come
at the same time.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.085
Okay.
- That is important.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.920
Do you understand?
- I promise . - Okay.

33:25.040 --> 33:28.044
United at their daughters bedside.
- Okay.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.169
Look here, it's the foot.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.244
It' s constantly kicking me.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.360
Do you feel that?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.121
Not so hard.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.607
Come on,
the face doesn' t hurt that much.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.650
Have you washed yourself?

35:21.560 --> 35:22.925
Show me your butt.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.360
All right.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.449
<i>This afternoon,</i>

35:36.680 --> 35:39.729
<i>the Dutch city of Enschede.
Was shaken by a huge explosion,</i>

35:39.920 --> 35:43.129
<i>The first reports of the fire at
a fireworks factory</i>

35:43.320 --> 35:46.802
<i>were only vague, yet later
it became a certainty .</i>

35:47.000 --> 35:49.446
<i>Enschede, hours after
the explosion.</i>

35:49.680 --> 35:51.682
<i>Clouds of smoke
still rise in the sky</i>

35:51.880 --> 35:56.010
<i>and give a first impression
of the size of the disaster...</i>

36:01.160 --> 36:03.731
So now it is just as
if we had kissed.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.089
Since it had my spit on it.

36:07.560 --> 36:08.560
Here.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.567
It's better than plastic toys.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.243
<i>At the time there happened to be</i>

36:20.440 --> 36:24.684
<i>a cameraman for the Dutch
Local TV station TV Oost at the site .</i>

36:24.880 --> 36:27.850
<i>His pictures are
a cinematic document.</i>

36:28.040 --> 36:30.691
<i>Of the minutes of terror
that took place.</i>

36:36.520 --> 36:41.208
Nah, too tight for me,
just go over to your mattress.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.080
Ah!

37:09.400 --> 37:10.845
Come here, little one.

37:11.200 --> 37:15.569
<i>After Tonis birth
my parents just argued.</i>

37:16.960 --> 37:19.884
Blow it out, sweetie,
make a wish.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.168
Please let dad back inside.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.450
Tadaa! For you.

37:36.960 --> 37:40.726
<i>The most beautiful thing was the
reconciliation after each battle.</i>

37:41.600 --> 37:44.763
<i>Sometimes you had to
help out a little.</i>

37:51.000 --> 37:54.049
<i>Eventually they didn' t want
to be helped anymore,</i>

37:54.400 --> 37:56.164
<i>and divorced .</i>

37:56.360 --> 37:59.091
<i>And they put me in a boarding school.</i>

38:01.920 --> 38:04.969
<i>But I couldn' t stand it
for too long .</i>

38:05.160 --> 38:08.801
<i>And luckily there were others,
who sorely needed my help.</i>

38:09.000 --> 38:11.446
Okay, then just stick
your finger inside.

38:20.880 --> 38:22.291
And then smell it.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.526
Do it one more time.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.691
Hi.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.690
Make yourself at home.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.006
<i>This is Michael .</i>

38:47.200 --> 38:51.444
<i>The boy Corinna is head
over heels in love with.</i>

38:51.680 --> 38:52.680
Hi.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.320
<i>And Michael has
other advantages .</i>

38:59.200 --> 39:02.124
<i>He pushed
the best grass in town.</i>

39:02.320 --> 39:03.321
Do you have money?

39:04.440 --> 39:06.647
Watch out that he doesn' t
steal anything.

39:06.840 --> 39:07.840
I'll get money.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.405
So, what do you do?

39:25.200 --> 39:26.611
I sell drugs.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.371
Nah, I mean in
your spare time.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.091
I listen to music.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.440
Cool.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.404
Hm
- And...

39:37.800 --> 39:40.041
what do you listen to?
- Minimal.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.566
Uh!

40:29.160 --> 40:30.764
Stop it.

40:37.680 --> 40:38.680
Stop it!

40:40.040 --> 40:42.042
Give me my teddy!
Right now!

40:42.680 --> 40:45.809
Your teddy looks completely torn.
We must bury him, Toni.

40:46.160 --> 40:47.160
No!

40:47.320 --> 40:48.845
Give me my teddy!

41:03.280 --> 41:04.850
You have beautiful breasts.

41:16.400 --> 41:19.085
When I bathe,
I always dive right in.

41:19.840 --> 41:20.840
Mhm.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.445
Everything is warm then.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.131
Hot?
- And quiet.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.521
Somehow one feels so...

41:30.360 --> 41:31.850
sheltered or something.

41:32.640 --> 41:33.640
Like a child.

41:34.640 --> 41:35.640
Like a child?

41:37.680 --> 41:40.251
I would sure like to be
real small again.

41:40.440 --> 41:42.090
Do you?

41:43.200 --> 41:44.200
No.

41:45.360 --> 41:48.204
I don' t know my
way around children.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.767
I've had me sterilized.

41:58.680 --> 42:00.887
And what does your mother say
about that?

42:03.400 --> 42:04.765
She doesn' t know.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.967
It's all gone well.

42:45.800 --> 42:50.681
How can one be so stupid,
as to cut oneself in the ass?

42:50.880 --> 42:52.928
Well, maybe there is
a loving God after all,

42:53.120 --> 42:54.849
and everyone gets the injury,
he deserves.

42:56.040 --> 42:57.246
Is it possible

42:57.640 --> 43:01.884
to see what they cut
away at the surgery?

43:03.120 --> 43:06.761
I do not want
that a part of me ends up in the trash,

43:07.120 --> 43:10.329
with appendixes and abortions.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.927
I 'll ask around
if it's ok.

43:13.120 --> 43:14.610
Did my parents come?

43:14.960 --> 43:17.725
No, I could only reach
their voicemail.

43:17.920 --> 43:21.083
But I told them about the fissure
and the successful OP..

43:21.280 --> 43:23.044
And about the hemorrhoids.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.411
What are you listening to?

43:36.320 --> 43:38.368
<i>Valerie, it's me .</i>

43:38.600 --> 43:40.841
<i>I do not know
whether you'll ever hear this,</i>

43:41.040 --> 43:42.690
<i>but this is for you .</i>

44:41.800 --> 44:42.800
Oh.

44:42.960 --> 44:43.960
What's up?

44:45.280 --> 44:46.281
I've got it.

44:46.520 --> 44:48.841
I'm impressed, nurse Robin.

44:52.600 --> 44:54.204
Where 's my clothes?

44:54.600 --> 44:55.601
They're over here.

44:58.080 --> 44:59.080
Oh.

44:59.400 --> 45:02.210
This is the situation,
mom is so afraid of.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.970
<i>Her absolute nightmare .</i>

45:06.520 --> 45:09.842
<i>My mom thinks
the most important thing for a woman is,</i>

45:10.040 --> 45:13.089
<i>to have clean underwear
in hospital.</i>

45:13.280 --> 45:17.842
<i>But unfortunately you do not know in
advance, when you get to the hospital.</i>

45:58.280 --> 46:02.251
<i>Mamas 's last thoughts
before her death at the scene would be:</i>

46:02.640 --> 46:05.803
<i>How many hours
have I worn my underpants?</i>

46:07.920 --> 46:09.410
<i>Are there any traces yet?</i>

46:33.960 --> 46:35.962
I can gladly
wash it for you if you want.

46:36.320 --> 46:38.561
No. I can wear
them one more week.

46:39.800 --> 46:41.962
Can you call my parents?

46:42.600 --> 46:47.686
You have to order them here.
Tomorrow. At five . It' s important.

46:48.040 --> 46:49.451
Both of them together.

46:49.680 --> 46:52.650
Tomorrow, five o' clock, together.

46:52.840 --> 46:55.161
Here . In this room.

46:57.160 --> 46:58.571
Yes, got it.

46:58.920 --> 47:00.604
If you' re in pain,
simply ring...

47:00.800 --> 47:01.800
I will.

47:02.560 --> 47:03.560
Okay.

47:03.880 --> 47:05.450
Robin?
- Yes?

47:07.240 --> 47:08.240
Thank you.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.806
Don' t be frightened
Light comes on.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.446
It' s a high-fiber diet
for you.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.967
And what if
I have a bowel movement?

47:28.640 --> 47:30.847
The wound will heal
with daily bowel movements,

47:31.040 --> 47:33.441
so that everything expands nicely.
Come on.

47:38.720 --> 47:39.720
One more.

47:43.840 --> 47:46.286
After your bowel movement
you are fired.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.085
So eat it nicely.

48:33.640 --> 48:34.640
Shit.

49:25.200 --> 49:28.522
Sorry.
How can I help you, Helen?

49:31.160 --> 49:32.605
Do you smell something?

49:34.960 --> 49:36.849
Hmm... barely.

49:50.440 --> 49:54.286
Can we speak less formal now?
- Yes, of course.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.569
I need to ask you something.

50:00.680 --> 50:01.680
Yes?

50:04.840 --> 50:07.411
Could you photograph my wound?

50:08.280 --> 50:09.280
My butt hole?

50:10.240 --> 50:11.890
Nope.
- Nope?

50:12.080 --> 50:15.129
That... that's not allowed.
- That's not allowed?

50:15.320 --> 50:17.000
Nope. Well I do not know
if it is allowed,

50:17.080 --> 50:18.605
but I think
it's not allowed.

50:18.800 --> 50:21.280
But noone has to know
if we do this.

50:22.680 --> 50:24.728
You only have to take your cellphone.

50:24.920 --> 50:28.641
No, my phone is not allowed
in the patients rooms for sure.

50:28.840 --> 50:31.525
But it's not for calling
someone up now is it, Robin.

50:31.880 --> 50:34.406
You do want to photograph
my ass.

50:34.640 --> 50:35.640
Right?

50:40.680 --> 50:44.571
This is really good.
- That's it. I know it.

50:46.640 --> 50:47.880
Here.

50:48.080 --> 50:50.731
That's more hole than ass, man.

50:51.640 --> 50:54.246
I can' t be an ass-model
anymore with that.

50:54.640 --> 50:57.086
I 've never been allowed to see
the wounds of other patients.

50:57.280 --> 50:58.725
Yes?
- Yes . Right.

50:58.920 --> 51:01.890
Now maybe a bit more...
Just take your hand away from there.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.080
So?
- Yes.

51:09.320 --> 51:11.891
Have you had a bowel movement?
- No.

51:13.400 --> 51:14.765
Really?
- Really.

51:17.320 --> 51:19.129
How are we feeling today?

51:20.560 --> 51:23.086
Crappy.
- Crappy?

51:23.280 --> 51:24.280
Yes.

51:24.880 --> 51:27.645
I have a picture
of your masterpiece.

51:28.440 --> 51:29.851
Uh, here.

51:33.040 --> 51:37.170
But as far as I can see the
photo has been made at close range

51:42.880 --> 51:43.880
Yes.

51:44.760 --> 51:45.760
Yes.

51:49.200 --> 51:50.440
Very close.

51:51.560 --> 51:52.560
Well,

51:52.720 --> 51:56.122
in this routine procedure
there were no complications.

51:56.520 --> 51:58.010
Except for anal incontinence?

51:58.840 --> 52:00.842
You do not know that,
what you're talking about.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.690
Of course, I know that

52:02.880 --> 52:05.690
Anal incontinence? - Yes.
- Is the wound bleeding then?

52:06.040 --> 52:07.405
Nope.
- You see.

52:07.800 --> 52:11.850
So, once you have a bowel movement,
You can go home. Yes?

52:12.040 --> 52:15.442
And that can happen today.

52:15.680 --> 52:19.890
Memel. I am Helen's mom.
- Ah! Excellent. Glad to meet you.

52:20.080 --> 52:23.084
We have just noticed
how wonderful the operation went.

52:23.280 --> 52:26.284
Oh, wonderful! I am pleased.
- I beg to differ, mama.

52:26.520 --> 52:28.522
She's a bit high-strung ofcourse,
your daughter

52:28.720 --> 52:30.370
It's quite normal
in girls at that age.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.011
- Exactly.
- Oh, really?

52:32.200 --> 52:34.646
Yes. don't worry.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.685
We have befriended eachother.
Right? Michael? Yes?

52:37.880 --> 52:39.928
But when you need tips for
bringing her up,

52:40.120 --> 52:41.929
then we will help you.

52:42.120 --> 52:44.600
We have to deal with difficult
personalities more often here.

52:46.960 --> 52:48.928
And you were?
- Professor Dr. Notz.

52:49.120 --> 52:51.043
I am the head doctor of this clinic.
- Ah, yes.

52:51.720 --> 52:53.131
Doctor Notz,

52:53.520 --> 52:56.091
Her mother is perhaps
a difficult personality,

52:56.280 --> 52:59.090
but not my daughter.
If I may give you a hint:

52:59.800 --> 53:03.122
Keep your mouth shut
and do your work.

53:03.840 --> 53:04.840
Bye.

53:09.560 --> 53:12.404
Cede repugnanti!
Cedendo victor abibis.

53:12.800 --> 53:15.121
Give in to the one who defends himself.

53:15.520 --> 53:18.922
In yielding you'll
emerge victorious . Hm?

53:24.320 --> 53:27.847
Now they will all hate
me here . Because of you.

53:28.920 --> 53:30.445
How was the surgery?

53:32.520 --> 53:33.646
Was not there.

53:34.440 --> 53:35.771
It was general anesthesia.

53:36.120 --> 53:38.282
You're too early.
I appointed you at five.

53:38.520 --> 53:40.807
Can you come again after work?

53:41.160 --> 53:44.243
My god, one can' t do
anything right with you.

53:46.560 --> 53:48.210
God again.

53:50.360 --> 53:52.886
Can you take that god
up there down?

53:53.240 --> 53:56.210
No, I can not.
- Still. It bothers me.

53:57.040 --> 53:59.168
Quit that nonsense, Helen.

53:59.560 --> 54:01.324
I can do it myself as well.

54:01.720 --> 54:02.720
No.

54:08.240 --> 54:09.810
All right, I'll do it already!

54:17.320 --> 54:18.320
Careful.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.444
Since when did you have ..

54:27.240 --> 54:29.004
These things there on you?

54:29.920 --> 54:30.920
Hemorrhoids?

54:32.880 --> 54:34.291
Yes.
- Always have.

54:34.680 --> 54:36.409
Not true, I have bathed
you as a baby.

54:36.800 --> 54:38.211
It's been a while.

54:39.440 --> 54:40.440
Yes.

54:40.640 --> 54:43.120
They are hereditary.
The hemorrhoids.

54:44.680 --> 54:48.446
Do you have them, or dad?
- You got them from your father

54:48.680 --> 54:50.921
I got your stuff,
without which you can not even...

54:51.120 --> 54:52.246
Yes. I see it.

54:52.640 --> 54:55.371
There are seven.
That's the second.

54:59.280 --> 55:01.248
<i>I love soft surfaces .</i>

55:02.040 --> 55:07.001
<i>As the greasy leather of
the buck in our sports hall in the past.</i>

55:08.320 --> 55:11.642
<i>But you have to save
these moments for</i>

55:11.840 --> 55:13.330
<i>when nobody notices .</i>

55:13.560 --> 55:15.608
Helen!
What are you doing?

55:15.960 --> 55:17.405
What is that nonsense?

55:19.200 --> 55:22.682
<i>Or so soft
like the glans of a penis .</i>

58:20.600 --> 58:24.400
<i>I really want, ever
since I can remember, to have a child.</i>

58:25.160 --> 58:30.087
<i>But in our family there is a
recurring pattern:</i>

58:33.080 --> 58:34.809
<i>My great-grandmother .</i>

58:35.000 --> 58:36.411
<i>My grandma .</i>

58:36.640 --> 58:37.880
<i>My mama .</i>

58:38.080 --> 58:39.127
<i>And I.</i>

58:39.320 --> 58:40.560
<i>All firstborn .</i>

58:40.920 --> 58:41.920
<i>All girls.</i>

58:42.080 --> 58:45.084
<i>All weak nerves,
disturbed and unhappy.</i>

58:55.600 --> 58:58.888
<i>With my sterilization I
have broken this cycle.</i>

59:00.760 --> 59:01.966
<i>From my tummy</i>

59:02.320 --> 59:06.086
<i>unhappy, disturbed beings
will never crawl out.</i>

59:33.120 --> 59:34.929
Okay! Thank you!

59:35.760 --> 59:39.446
I have brought you
something from America.

59:39.680 --> 59:42.650
The Turduck roast.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.925
You take a quail,
the quail one stuffs into a chicken,

59:47.280 --> 59:49.282
the chicken into a goose

59:49.520 --> 59:55.402
and in the end we have the turkey,
which entirely covers the goose.

59:55.640 --> 59:57.324
Okay.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.887
Oh, it makes me feel queasy in the stomach.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:07.642
At Helen's birth, the doctors had
to make an episiotomy.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.729
There was a noise
just like this.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.806
And actually...

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.603
it looked exactly like
this as well.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.441
It's an organic turkey,
so everyone, even the vegetarians...

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.880
Cheers!

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.042
You want
me to applaude?

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.525
Look,
that's where they've cut.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.646
It's all I wanted to say.
That's where they've cut in.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440
Ass.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.685
Slugs.
Is this an allusion to my butt hole?

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.407
I thought you were interested
in slugs.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.722
You asked me about
them sometimes.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.366
And now I have a whole book.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040
Yes.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.524
I get tablets for the pain.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.880
What pain?

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.446
At my butt.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.840
Ofourse.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.163
What kind of tablets?
- Neoncoloured.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.769
Do you still have an appointment?

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.200
No.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.331
You? - I need to
leave you alone again unfortunately.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.360
Hospitals, those are not for me.
I feel myself quite ill.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.803
But you can still
read to me a bit.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.727
It's summer now, everything is dry
and the snail is scared...

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.763
dying of heat.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.202
I will read to you gladly.
When I pick you up.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.526
Well, a friendly greeting
to your collegues then.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.525
Which colleagues?

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.404
Your work colleagues.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.324
Be well.
- Uh-huh.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.570
Good to see you.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.290
That's good,
I have to tell you something.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.601
I love you.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.531
I will stay with you forever,
even if I do not love you.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.370
It has to be so,
when you have children.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.611
Get well soon.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.727
I've been thinking about your
wound and about your...

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.365
...Looseness.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.281
I've talked it over with
a buddy and he told me...

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.847
that you're an exhibitionist
or something.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.008
I don' t know how he gets
that idea.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.525
Loving to show, I always say.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.726
Yes. Is that bad?
- Not at all, I...

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.969
On the contrary, I would hope
that more girls...

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.001
be like this, ehm,
who take the initiative, you know ..

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.281
Come a little closer.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.560
Come closer.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.044
Now close your eyes.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.240
What?

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.164
Close your eyes.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.922
<i>I 'll tell you a story.</i>

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.930
<i>In the street where I live,
is a brothel . The Sauna Oasis.</i>

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.889
<i>Guys are always invited for their
18th birthday by their parents.</i>

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:04.527
<i>I was not invited.
So I did everything myself .</i>

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.686
Hi.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.565
Any women
who do it with women?

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.526
Cynthia!

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.643
And I pick one.

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.129
Come on.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.771
Put it on the table.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.280
Thank you.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.450
Can I lick you?

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:52.680
Yes.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.406
Did you come?

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.680
Yes.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.650
That went pretty fast alright.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.210
Do you know why I I picked you?

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.600
Nope.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.521
Copper roof,
always damp in the basement.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.322
That's what my father always said.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.687
I will give it to her.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.202
These are the residues that they
have cut away from your anus.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.368
Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:20.928
Did you have a bowel movement?
- I do not think so.

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:22.439
And you?

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:26.640
The material in the bag
is highly infectious.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.171
So deal with it accordingly, ok?

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:29.805
Hygiene is paramount
in the hospital.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.528
It's at home with me,
also an important issue.

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:37.290
You know, the sooner you dump,
the sooner we are rid of you, ok?

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.926
Do you understand me?

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:43.408
When you're finished playing
with your ass parts

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.246
make sure they go
back to the hospital waste.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.041
<i>You've got great eyelashes.</i>

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:52.562
One can't beat natural lashes
like that, right, Mrs. Memel?

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.760
Mhm.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.687
You must be proud of your daughter.
Hello, sweetness.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.966
Well then, pleasure to talk to you.
- Yeah.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.729
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.523
An old gypsy saying goes,

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.406
when one gets too many
compliments for something,

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.563
then perhaps it's about to break down.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.080
Look.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.921
Here, for you.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:32.724
This is all just
a dream, sweetheart.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.080
Go back to sleep.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.005
<i>I'm not sure mama really
did this,</i>

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.886
<i>because I often mix up
reality, lies and dreams .</i>

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.845
<i>Mainly because of the many drugs,
I've taken .</i>

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.725
Michael
left his drugsbox.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.729
And went
off with the real cola.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.762
Do we need to notice him?

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.091
A mustache kiss.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.006
Oh, my God.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.609
This one is a bit longer.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.320
Slowly.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.040
Stop.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.722
<i>Hi, this is Michael.
First I, then beep, then you</i>

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.844
Oh man, voicemail again.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.208
Here is your favorite Helen.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.922
If you are looking for your Coke can,
uh, we have it.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.567
We have started to drink,
the Coke already. Bye.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.285
Okay, he knows.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.446
Yummy!

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.522
Have you actually
ever slept together?

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.451
No. He waits for
the right moment . - I see.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.086
Um...

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.080
Juhu!

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.728
Hey, we were here before.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.162
I think I am completely sober.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.528
I'm cold . Fire!

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:51.687
<i>Debt was the main outcome
of our adventure .</i>

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.201
<i>Michael wouldn't talk
to us for a week.</i>

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.242
<i>And to appease Michael,
I baptized the rat Michael 2 .</i>

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.206
<i>Unfortunately Michael 2 had
left us again soon..</i>

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:24.725
<i>In revenge, I decided
kill her new husband .</i>

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:38.044
<i>But that I would have done
my mother a favor .</i>

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.440
What are you doing?
- I'll cover you up, you're very exposed.

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.330
Just let it go.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.166
Does't matter what it looks like.
- Then stay like that, in God's name.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.441
Yes.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.286
You're late.
You can leave again.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.606
You're impossible.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.288
I wish that once you
have a daughter,

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:31.285
she acts to you like this
as well, tit for tat.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.363
Then you're in for a long wait.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:34.880
Why?

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.404
Don't you want children?

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.211
Can this be thrown out?

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.360
Give it to me.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.722
These are the parts
from my ass.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.010
Can you go now?

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.529
Can come back tomorrow.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.240
Just go.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.931
And be on time tomorrow.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.851
<i>Valerie...</i>

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.328
<i>we only wanted to say to you</i>

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.929
<i>that we'd like to thank you
for the last two years</i>

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.521
<i>and the 175 night shifts,
you've taken...</i>

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.840
<i>Thank you .</i>

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.809
And all the best
for your birthday and...

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.891
<i>Hello, Spacko.
I need a pizza.</i>

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:34.201
Yes, a spinach pizza and a six pack
At the Hilf... Maria Hilf Hospital.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.085
Room 265 Did you write that down?

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.800
All right.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.362
If the pizza is cold,
I'll shove it up your ass.

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.851
<i>Corrina is such a good friend of mine,</i>

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.408
<i>that we are always get our period at
the same time.</i>

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:54.127
<i>And we made up something
special about that .</i>

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:55.601
Are you ready?

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.167
<i>We exchanged our Tampons.</i>

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.931
<i>Corinna put my
selfmade one in,</i>

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:04.443
<i>with which I hope to ban the American
Tampon industry .</i>

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.842
There it comes, okay?

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.611
My blood sister.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.811
My blood sister.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.251
Say, do you actually get
those things back out?

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.120
Most of the time.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:39.001
<i>The only small disadvantage
to my homemade tampons is,</i>

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.330
<i>that they lack the small
blue filament.</i>

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.564
I can't get it out.
- Okay, do not panic.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.761
Ah.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.644
Where was it?
Thank you.

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:33.003
<i>Where are you going?
Hello? I'm talking to you.</i>

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.964
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:38.209
Well that took forever.
- Oh, you ordered pizza?

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.604
That makes 19 euros.
- So, I 'll give you 12

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.043
Helen, shouldn't you eat
high fiber food after surgery?

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.844
The prices are not negotiable.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.929
Can you advance me something?
I 'm broke.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.002
What about tipping?
- Say a nice greeting to the kitchen.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.650
Tell them a drunken monkey
could bake a better pizza.

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.606
All right.
- Helen Memel is the name.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.800
Fuck me.
- Wow.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.202
Give it to me.
- Mmm.

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.801
Give it to me!
- That is proper juicy.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.408
Want some?

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.560
No thanks, I've had some.
- Do you want beer?

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.290
You know, there simply
are certain rules.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.646
For you or for me?
- Well, for all of us.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.808
For all.

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.445
Stop that! Man!

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:31.760
Thank you.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.531
Do you know my pizza story?
- Nope.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.962
You don't?
- Nah, tell me.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.209
That's why I 'm
so soggy with the delivery boy.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.400
Mhm.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.809
Because I want sex.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.362
With very many different men.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.602
At the same time.
- Sounds logical.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.371
First of all . - This story has gone
around for a long time.

01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.206
Two girls order pizza.

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.123
But the pizza doesn't arrive.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.888
<i>And so the girls keep calling
back and complain.</i>

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.648
<i>Sometime later, the pizza arrives.</i>

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.851
<i>But somehow
the pizza tastes funny.</i>

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.607
<i>So the girls bring
the pizza to one ot their fathers,</i>

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:23.248
coincidentially a food chemist.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.768
<i>Still, they all think
the pizza has gone bad or so.</i>

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:31.364
<i>But the analysis tells
a different story.</i>

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.204
<i>On the pizza...</i>

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:37.366
is the cum
of four different men.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.762
Well, I imagine the origin
of the story like this:

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.164
Our friends are annoyed.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:51.961
And because the main characters are girls,
they have rape fantasies.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:54.720
Normal.

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:58.967
<i>So they get their cocks out
and jerk off together on the pizza .</i>

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.171
I would like to eat such a pizza.

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:14.202
That would be as if four men
ejaculate directly into my mouth.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.365
Did you ever get an opportunity
like that before?

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.730
Uh, rather rare.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.210
Ahh... is delicious.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.720
Good night.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:36.891
Sleep.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:58.007
Got my money yet?

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.885
I' ve almost shit
my pants, you Spacko.

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:08.001
Corinna and I need the money.
- Corinna and you?

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.081
Do you want to move in together or what?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.081
Something like that.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.568
What 's wrong with Michael?

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.206
What? Did you finally get
to play on his magic flute?

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.171
No.
Could you?

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.686
I am pregnant.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.440
Aha.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.086
You know, I 'm looking forward
to it.

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.688
I think it's selfish of you.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.211
But that doesn't change a thing between us.
- This changes everything.

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.810
And you know it

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.651
Do you know why you
have a family like you do?

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.922
Do you know why you
have no friends?

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.126
You stink.

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:01.889
I feel sorry for you.

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.366
Get out!

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.004
<i>In Helen's birth,</i>

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.011
<i>because the doctors had to
make an episiotomy .</i>

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:29.406
<i>makes me feel queasy .</i>

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.441
It smells of gas in my room.

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:46.926
I smell nothing.

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.247
Maybe not.

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:54.925
It was just a joke.

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.280
What is this?

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.202
I thought it was boring without you.

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:03.928
Do me a favor
and don't take me for a fool, okay?

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.601
No, I get this sometimes.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:13.046
- But I do not know why.

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.240
Good night.

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.524
Yeah, fuck you too, Robin.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:22.927
What?

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.280
Nothing.

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:28.091
Fuck you all.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:29.600
Assholes.

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.440
Good day, daughter.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.761
Good day, dad.

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.160
Surprise?

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:26.680
A balloon?

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.286
A red balloon.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.568
That will make me
better for sure, dad.

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.046
No idea what that is?

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.049
A hemorrhoid cushion.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.527
You can sit on it,
with no pain.

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.689
Did you get this
from the plumbing trade?

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.042
Isn't it called the medical trade?

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.400
Right.

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.651
Your hair is gray.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Well.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:05.642
Maybe I should leave
you be for now.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.048
Start with the grieving process.

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.531
If you're gone then,

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:14.166
everyone will wonder
why I'm so well off.

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.290
Sounds reasonable.

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.770
What?
- Nothing.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.929
Thanks for inflating it.

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.520
I 've got to be
back on the road.

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.564
It really is hard
with your schedule.

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.328
Yes, work is waiting.

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:20.845
What are you
by profession, dad?

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.681
You have no idea, what do I do?

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.965
Not exactly, no.

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:32.080
I am an engineer.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.928
Should I also become an engineer?

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.440
Yes.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:46.449
But you're so bad at math

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:07.605
Are you in pain?

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.091
I discourage the use of this pillow.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.810
It's for people with
unoperated hemorrhoids,

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:23.644
and if you sit on it,
then everything breaks again.

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:29.680
Is the wouind bleeding?

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.160
No.

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.004
Then everything is good.

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.289
We can dismiss you.

01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.571
No, I need to stay there,
I still have to have bowel movements.

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:47.691
This pressure on defecation,
brings nothing good.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.690
Try it in peace.
At home.

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:53.327
Can I still stay one day?

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:57.808
No, we only see eachother
if the wound is bleeding.

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:00.840
Well.

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.085
Never to be seen again.

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:06.844
I say, good-bye.

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.164
Yes? What are you doing?

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:00.886
Holy shit!

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:04.687
I moved a little weird earlier.

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.971
Out of my way, please!

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.650
Prepare general anesthesia.

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.724
Caution! Man!

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.003
Robin, you have to
call my parents.

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.850
Both, okay?
- Yes.

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.690
Tell them what happened.

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.691
This is my last chance
to get them here together.

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.362
They are preparing
the OR for you right now.

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.081
They don't have to clean
it up for me.

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.681
I don' t care too much
about order.

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:48.086
Yes. I know.

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:51.967
- So, there you go.
- Robin, I 'm afraid.

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.642
Yes, I 'm scared too.
I'm scared for you.

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:19.206
We need to start now,
because you lost a lot of blood.

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.926
You may think that you're
still aware of everything,

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.443
but this is in reality only a fraction of
of what is going on.

01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:32.840
Here we have all
had a bit of bad luck.

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.087
Especially you.

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:43.730
<i>Everyone hoped that I' d forget.</i>

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:48.246
<i>But through her silence
it has become ever greater.</i>

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.688
<i>Until it has swallowed me.</i>

01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:59.888
<i>I have Toni tells everything.</i>

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:03.163
<i>The hardest conversation
I 've ever had to perform .</i>

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:10.246
The did you know?
- I always have this shit dreams.

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.203
Where is he?
- I do not know who you mean.

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:53.009
He gave me this thing
over here.

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.248
I got it turned on,
but there is nothing on it.

01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:57.440
Only noise.

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.080
Helen?

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.242
Are you laid off?

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.410
I've been looking for you.

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:41.769
Yes, I'm just on the way home.

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.962
You're lucky that you
still caught me..

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.207
You too.

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.320
Bacause you can take me to
your home.

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:53.447
You really have to think over
whether that's okay with you.

01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.241
Yes.

01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:59.963
Yes, you still have to think,
or yes, you're okay with it?

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.321
<i>If I live with you,
surely you want to sleep with me.</i>

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:33.283
Yes. But for starters,
not in the ass.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:04.805
Get me out of here.

01:45:05.305 --> 01:45:11.679
