02:28.333 --> 02:29.874
- Can't believe
it's been a year.

02:29.875 --> 02:32.417
- Happy anniversary.

02:35.500 --> 02:36.666
Oh, now that we're married,

02:36.667 --> 02:38.165
you wouldn't mind
giving us that double?

02:38.166 --> 02:41.458
- I hate to break it to you
Marc, you're still not married.

02:43.291 --> 02:45.749
Not by the law that counts.

02:45.750 --> 02:46.166
(keys clinking)

02:46.167 --> 02:47.709
Sleep well.

03:07.208 --> 03:08.458
- Don't get comfortable.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.207
Do you want to get
taken to court again?

03:22.208 --> 03:24.249
- We don't have doubles anymore.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.999
We got rid of them
after the verdict.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.332
There's no discrimination
now that everyone's treated

03:28.333 --> 03:31.625
exactly the same
just like you wanted.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.249
You won't be happy 'til
we're out of business.

03:35.250 --> 03:38.666
- All I want is a bed for the
night, like Mary and Joseph.

03:38.667 --> 03:41.374
- Mary and Joseph didn't put
shit through their letterbox.

03:41.375 --> 03:43.124
- Neither did we.

03:43.125 --> 03:47.124
- There's a dozen places around
here you could've stayed.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.709
- I'm staying here

03:49.917 --> 03:51.624
with my husband.

03:51.625 --> 03:53.541
- You want to call him that,
I'm not gonna stop you.

03:53.542 --> 03:57.624
- Funny, you won't stop us
expressing our love either.

03:57.625 --> 03:59.374
- I have earplugs.

03:59.375 --> 04:00.708
Knock yourself out.

04:00.709 --> 04:01.709
(cellphone ringing)

04:01.710 --> 04:04.040
- What?

04:04.041 --> 04:05.999
(bed scraping)

04:06.000 --> 04:07.959
- I found us a double.

04:08.917 --> 04:11.625
(bed scraping)

04:12.792 --> 04:14.500
Didn't recognize you.

04:15.417 --> 04:16.083
- Why are you back?

04:16.084 --> 04:19.582
- My husband's a bad winner.

04:19.583 --> 04:20.583
- It's on Facebook.

04:20.584 --> 04:23.082
We could get all sorts
of nutters tonight.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.833
- That's what I said.

04:24.834 --> 04:26.958
- You should go.

04:26.959 --> 04:29.708
(feet stomping)

04:29.709 --> 04:33.290
- Anyone else book?

04:33.291 --> 04:35.208
- What are you doing?

04:36.709 --> 04:37.958
He can kick us out for that.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.207
(bed scraping)

04:39.208 --> 04:43.792
You can tell your dad we're
not gonna make it that easy.

04:44.625 --> 04:47.041
- We're fine, don't bother him.

04:47.750 --> 04:50.375
- Could we have some privacy?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.416
(dramatic music)

04:55.417 --> 04:58.166
- Don't take it out on the kid.

05:00.542 --> 05:01.708
Let's find somewhere to eat.

05:01.709 --> 05:02.208
- Oh we're eating here.

05:02.208 --> 05:02.875
- Eating a steak?

05:02.876 --> 05:04.624
No thanks.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.500
(soft eerie music)

05:08.917 --> 05:11.709
(lips smacking)

05:18.750 --> 05:20.457
- Why don't we do it
on the reception desk?

05:20.458 --> 05:21.417
- Now you're talking.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.750
I'll check out the facilities.

05:29.166 --> 05:32.417
(crows cawing)
(soft eerie music)

05:34.333 --> 05:36.749
- [Josh] Joining us for dinner?

05:36.750 --> 05:37.458
- Love to.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.125
Do you have a menu?
- It's lamb.

05:41.750 --> 05:44.165
Unless you're vegetarian.

05:44.166 --> 05:45.500
I had to let the cook go.

05:47.166 --> 05:48.834
I won't poison you.

05:49.917 --> 05:50.792
Room okay?

05:50.793 --> 05:52.791
- Well a single
is a bit intimate,

05:52.792 --> 05:55.082
but we'll make the most of it.

05:55.083 --> 05:56.417
- Oh come on.

05:57.041 --> 05:58.499
You've won.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.833
You have the rings, you
have everything you want.

06:00.834 --> 06:01.999
What more is there?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.082
- Equal rights: use
them or lose them.

06:04.083 --> 06:06.666
- You're already equal.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.082
If you think what
you do is equal,

06:09.083 --> 06:09.959
it isn't me you
have a problem with,

06:09.959 --> 06:10.667
it's basic biology.
- Go tell that

06:10.668 --> 06:13.165
to the penguins or the giraffes.

06:13.166 --> 06:16.207
They were at it in Noah's Ark.

06:16.208 --> 06:18.582
- Keep no fear of God, see
how that works out for you.

06:18.583 --> 06:22.499
- No problem so far, God
must have a sense of humor.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.417
- [Josh] Yes he does.

06:27.959 --> 06:31.040
(door knocking)

06:31.041 --> 06:32.000
- Marc?

06:36.750 --> 06:39.374
(door knocking)

06:39.375 --> 06:39.667
What is it?

06:50.875 --> 06:54.083
(door latch clicking)

06:54.667 --> 06:56.709
- I'm on your side.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.333
- Okay.

07:01.208 --> 07:02.667
- I wasn't sure a year ago.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.417
- I'm sorry?

07:10.250 --> 07:12.374
That can't be easy.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.416
- Well, you're making
it a lot harder.

07:14.417 --> 07:16.541
You come and you wind him up
and I have to live with it.

07:16.542 --> 07:18.916
- We're not tryin'
to wind anyone up.

07:18.917 --> 07:20.375
- Well what then?

07:21.583 --> 07:24.582
- You're speaking to
the wrong agitator.

07:24.583 --> 07:28.040
- You can't hate
him more than I do.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.749
(soft piano music)

07:30.750 --> 07:32.708
- I don't hate him.

07:32.709 --> 07:33.709
- Then leave us alone.

07:40.959 --> 07:44.125
(door latch clicking)

07:53.542 --> 07:57.792
(faucet squeaking)

08:14.125 --> 08:16.290
(Jeep door slamming)

08:16.291 --> 08:20.500
(silverware clinking)

08:44.750 --> 08:47.375
- His kid's gay, poor bastard.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.916
- Let's not make
things worse for him.

08:52.917 --> 08:55.416
Why don't we just call
it quits and go home?

08:55.417 --> 08:58.499
- That's telling him that
we don't deserve to be here.

08:58.500 --> 09:02.375
- He's in a vulnerable
place, Marc.

09:05.959 --> 09:06.875
- I wish I could wrap you around

09:06.876 --> 09:09.291
my little finger that easily.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.374
How old are you Paul?

09:27.375 --> 09:29.625
- 16.
- As long as you're legal

09:31.000 --> 09:32.082
to serve alcohol.

09:32.083 --> 09:35.792
- You need a refill?
- No, no I'm just checking.

09:38.458 --> 09:40.207
- He started it.

09:40.208 --> 09:42.541
- He was cruising you,
vulnerable my ass.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.207
What?

09:44.208 --> 09:45.166
- Why don't you
cut him some slack?

09:45.167 --> 09:47.165
- What, dad too?

09:47.166 --> 09:48.582
- It is his home.

09:48.583 --> 09:49.500
- Well he can do what
he wants at home.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.332
He can hate on us all he likes.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.582
Not when he's
running a business.

09:53.583 --> 09:56.624
- Do you want to change his
mind or make him eat shit?

09:56.625 --> 09:57.999
- Either, or.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.082
- Remind me why I married you?

10:00.083 --> 10:04.375
(feet stomping above)
(somber music)

10:07.834 --> 10:11.916
- Oh dear, it looks
like Josh's invitation

10:11.917 --> 10:13.792
has backfired big time.

10:16.250 --> 10:17.208
He's gay.

10:22.834 --> 10:22.875
Hi there.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.208
How do you like the place?

10:31.041 --> 10:33.250
I'm Marc and this is Fred.

10:43.208 --> 10:46.041
(speaking Russian)

10:48.709 --> 10:49.417
Sorry?

10:49.418 --> 10:52.958
- Did you shoot the boy?

10:52.959 --> 10:55.792
(speaking Russian)

10:56.875 --> 10:58.207
- Didn't mean to disturb you.

10:58.208 --> 11:00.583
Enjoy your meal.

11:02.834 --> 11:06.417
Don't worry, there's
always barely legal.

11:07.917 --> 11:08.500
- Hi.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.166
(speaking Russian)

11:16.667 --> 11:18.875
Does anyone speak Russian?

11:21.250 --> 11:22.208
- Nyet.

11:24.542 --> 11:25.166
- No.

11:25.167 --> 11:27.875
(muffled conversation)

11:30.834 --> 11:32.542
- Sounds like Phil.

11:34.417 --> 11:37.542
(speaking Russian)

11:39.000 --> 11:40.583
- Let me show you.

11:46.083 --> 11:49.666
- Well it looks like your
boyfriend's got a new crush.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.666
- Someone should tell
him to be careful.

11:51.667 --> 11:52.708
- Dad's gonna have to
deal with this sometime.

11:52.709 --> 11:54.541
- I was talking
about the Russian.

11:54.542 --> 11:56.541
I wouldn't flow with him.

11:56.542 --> 11:58.416
- Our comrade is gay.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.000
- How do you know?

12:01.625 --> 12:03.124
- He checked me out.

12:03.125 --> 12:06.165
- He sized you up for
a smack in the mouth.

12:06.166 --> 12:07.249
- What have I done?

12:07.250 --> 12:08.457
- You're gay, he's Russian.

12:08.458 --> 12:09.541
- Now you're being racist.

12:09.542 --> 12:11.040
- He looks like a neo-Nazi.

12:11.041 --> 12:12.541
- How did we get to Nazis?

12:12.542 --> 12:14.624
- Josh put a call out
for like-minded bigots.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.374
Did you not think
anyone would turn up?

12:16.375 --> 12:19.582
- Having tattoos and being Russian
does not make you a Nazi.

12:19.583 --> 12:20.624
- Everything okay in here?

12:20.625 --> 12:21.458
- The food is great,
but I thought you could

12:21.459 --> 12:23.708
settle an argument for us.

12:23.709 --> 12:25.000
Stop kicking me, stop it.

12:28.041 --> 12:29.000
The Russian,

12:29.667 --> 12:32.834
is he with you or with us?

12:34.834 --> 12:35.792
- I don't follow.

12:35.793 --> 12:37.041
- Is he gay or straight?

12:41.458 --> 12:43.791
- Oh come on boys,
you wouldn't want me

12:43.792 --> 12:46.833
broadcasting your
preferences to strangers.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.875
Not everyone is as
tolerant as I am.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.040
- The Russian's on his side.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.999
That's why he was staring
at us, he saw our picture.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.749
Have you seen what they
do to gays in Russia?

12:58.750 --> 12:59.709
- Racist.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.958
- Gimme a shout if
you need anything.

13:02.959 --> 13:04.290
- Do we need to pay now?

13:04.291 --> 13:05.750
- I trust you.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.082
You've barely eaten.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.875
- No, I've had enough.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.791
- Don't you want to
see what's for dessert?

13:14.792 --> 13:15.709
- Not for me, thanks.

13:15.710 --> 13:19.457
- I'll have another glass.

13:19.458 --> 13:20.666
- I didn't sign up for this.

13:20.667 --> 13:25.333
I told you the first sign of
violence I am out the door.

13:29.917 --> 13:31.457
No.
- I have another glass coming.

13:31.458 --> 13:32.958
- Bring it up.

13:32.959 --> 13:36.000
- I am not going
to hide in my room.

13:38.542 --> 13:42.417
(mysterious music)

14:08.709 --> 14:09.417
(bell ringing)

14:09.418 --> 14:11.041
- Can I have an alarm call?

14:13.125 --> 14:14.708
I keep my phone off at night.

14:14.709 --> 14:16.416
- What time?

14:16.417 --> 14:17.791
- Nine?

14:17.792 --> 14:18.833
- There were no
phones in the room,

14:18.834 --> 14:19.792
so it will be a
knock on the door

14:19.793 --> 14:22.333
and I'm not coming in to check.

14:24.125 --> 14:24.166
- Perfect.

14:28.375 --> 14:31.333

15:40.583 --> 15:42.542

15:58.500 --> 16:02.374
but you have to be
careful with strangers.

16:02.375 --> 16:04.500
- Like you?
- The Russian.

16:11.041 --> 16:12.624
- He told me to
stay in the closet.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.249
- It's not about...

16:14.250 --> 16:14.959
It's about picking your moment.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.791
- I'm 16, he can't stop me.

16:17.792 --> 16:18.999
He can throw me out.

16:19.000 --> 16:19.959
He will throw me
out, I don't care.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.040
- If you care about your dad,

16:21.041 --> 16:23.333
I don't think Alexei's gay.

16:24.959 --> 16:26.499
- Did you talk to him?

16:26.500 --> 16:27.333
- He doesn't look gay to me

16:27.334 --> 16:29.958
and I've got a bit
more experience.

16:29.959 --> 16:31.625
- How does he look?

16:33.792 --> 16:34.959
- Dangerous.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.165
- When you two came last
year, I made a promise.

16:50.166 --> 16:53.499
I'm not gonna put up
with this anymore.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.332
- Does it have to be tonight?

16:55.333 --> 16:56.333
- He likes me.

16:56.334 --> 16:58.875
- That's what gay bashers do.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.749
You're not going to his room?

17:02.750 --> 17:03.999
- No, there's a park.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.540
He's got a map alright?

17:05.541 --> 17:06.665
He has to be gay.

17:06.666 --> 17:08.999
- Only if he's
looking for trouble.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.958
♪ Ran like a river,
now it's dry ♪

17:13.959 --> 17:14.333
You're scared.

17:16.750 --> 17:17.750
- (sighs) It's my first time.

17:17.751 --> 17:20.207
- Then it has to be right.

17:20.208 --> 17:24.375
Wait 'til you call the shots
when your dad's out of the way.

17:34.041 --> 17:36.917
(paper rustling)

17:38.166 --> 17:40.791
- You don't know
what it's been like

17:40.792 --> 17:41.833
when mum died.

17:41.834 --> 17:43.207
- He's still your dad

17:43.208 --> 17:45.374
and I promise you whatever
his religion says,

17:45.375 --> 17:46.541
he still loves you.

17:46.542 --> 17:47.833
- He's never said.
- It doesn't mean...

17:47.834 --> 17:49.500
- Because he knows.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.959
He's always known.

17:56.709 --> 18:00.250
He just expects me to
go though life lying.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.457
You know he actually
said, "If my son was gay,

18:04.458 --> 18:05.958
"I'd kill myself."

18:05.959 --> 18:08.249
- If he knew you were
gay, he wouldn't say that.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.166
He wouldn't think it.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.833
Hold on.

18:12.834 --> 18:13.792
- I can't.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.458
- You don't have to
go through with it.

18:25.041 --> 18:26.291
- Are you lost?

18:36.250 --> 18:37.125
You don't have to go
through with what?

18:37.125 --> 18:38.000
- [Paul] You'll find out
soon enough.

18:38.001 --> 18:39.541
- [Josh]
What were you telling him?

18:39.542 --> 18:40.916
- [Paul] I was telling him
how mum drank herself to death

18:40.917 --> 18:42.207
because she couldn't
stand it anymore!

18:42.208 --> 18:43.125
- [Josh] Keep your voice
down, control yourself.

18:43.125 --> 18:44.000
- [Paul] It should've been you!

18:44.001 --> 18:45.749
(hand smacking)

18:45.750 --> 18:49.333
(ominous music)

19:35.041 --> 19:36.249
- What's happened?
- He's not on Facebook.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.916
- Well they haven't
made that a crime yet.

19:37.917 --> 19:42.250
Alexei Petrovich, It's like
calling yourself Mr Smith.

19:43.000 --> 19:43.625
I saw him coming out the shower.

19:43.626 --> 19:45.457
He is covered in tattoos.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.290
This one means
somebody's done murder.

19:47.291 --> 19:48.833
The blood drops is a body count.

19:48.834 --> 19:50.624
This one means he's a
high-ranking criminal.

19:50.625 --> 19:51.874
- What is this, neo-Nazi bingo?

19:51.875 --> 19:53.666
- And this one means that he's
served more than five years.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.124
Yes bingo, full house let's go.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.207
- You've got a
pair of army pants.

19:57.208 --> 19:58.499
That doesn't make
you Jason Bourne.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.249
- He has got Jesus
all over his back.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.166
- So he's got gay basher
literally written all over him?

20:01.167 --> 20:03.500
- Yes.
- Sort of like a map?

20:07.458 --> 20:08.833
He's religious all right.

20:08.834 --> 20:11.916
He spends a lot of
time on his knees.

20:11.917 --> 20:14.416
This is the local cruising area.

20:14.417 --> 20:16.499
He was scoping it all
throughout dinner.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.082
He left it on the table.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.333
It's a come-on.

20:24.959 --> 20:27.374
- He's scoping targets.

20:27.375 --> 20:27.875
It is a come-on but
instead of hooking us,

20:27.876 --> 20:30.166
he hooked Paul.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.207
Let's go, please.

20:33.208 --> 20:34.874
- No.
- For me.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.207
- Don't do that.
- For me.

20:36.208 --> 20:37.583
- Don't do that!

20:38.959 --> 20:40.040
- If he's gay, why does
he keep looking at us

20:40.041 --> 20:42.667
like we're the enemy?

20:43.250 --> 20:45.917
- We're the competition.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.125
He thinks that we
are after Paul too.

21:01.417 --> 21:03.208
I'm not chasing you.

21:05.625 --> 21:05.667
I'm...

21:07.959 --> 21:11.375
(Marc sighing)

21:26.959 --> 21:30.500
(door knocking)

21:31.917 --> 21:35.124
- You might wanna keep
an eye on Paul tonight.

21:35.125 --> 21:37.124
- I don't need parenting
advice from you.

21:37.125 --> 21:40.082
- I'm talking about the Russian.

21:40.083 --> 21:44.166
- The only homosexuals
here tonight are you two.

21:45.375 --> 21:47.457
You got enough down here.

21:47.458 --> 21:50.250
(ominous music)

22:56.834 --> 22:58.749
(door latch clicking)

22:58.750 --> 23:02.124
(feet stomping)

23:02.125 --> 23:03.582
- Apology accepted.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.874
- Have you got a signal?

23:05.875 --> 23:06.583
He's blocked us in,
we can't get out.

23:06.584 --> 23:08.708
- Well, we'll ask him to move.

23:08.709 --> 23:10.499
- He could have parked anywhere.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.958
- I'll ask him.
- No wait.

23:11.959 --> 23:13.666
- You're afraid of
the way he parks now?

23:13.667 --> 23:14.542
- No, I tried to call a taxi.

23:14.543 --> 23:17.541
There's no signal
outside, downstairs,

23:17.542 --> 23:18.874
up here and there
was when we came

23:18.875 --> 23:21.040
right until he went
back into his room.

23:21.041 --> 23:23.417
O2 and Vodafone?

23:26.208 --> 23:27.499
- Why would he block our phones?

23:27.500 --> 23:28.791
- To stop us from
calling the police

23:28.792 --> 23:31.874
after he's kicked
the shit out of us.

23:31.875 --> 23:32.625
- If I could prove to you

23:32.626 --> 23:34.791
that far from being a gay basher

23:34.792 --> 23:37.374
our Russian is as
queer as Christmas,

23:37.375 --> 23:39.249
would you please come to bed?

23:39.250 --> 23:42.749
- No trying to prove anything.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.709
(water trickling)

23:49.458 --> 23:52.250
(keys rattling)

24:03.417 --> 24:04.333
Stop it!

24:11.333 --> 24:13.249
- Is that gay enough for you?

24:13.250 --> 24:16.291
Who else packs like that?

24:17.959 --> 24:19.667
- Army.

24:22.834 --> 24:25.709
(clothes rustling)

24:33.583 --> 24:37.207
- Hello, is that a phone
jammer in his pocket

24:37.208 --> 24:39.792
or is he just pleased to see me?

24:41.667 --> 24:44.458
(ominous music)

24:51.917 --> 24:52.625
- Oh shit!

24:55.083 --> 24:56.250
Put it back.

24:57.709 --> 24:59.792
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:08.583 --> 25:11.375
(keys rattling)

25:24.333 --> 25:25.999
- Hi, do you have that
landline we can use?

25:26.000 --> 25:26.917
- No, sorry.

25:28.291 --> 25:30.124
- No you don't have one
or no we can't use it?

25:30.125 --> 25:30.542
We'll pay.

25:30.543 --> 25:32.332
- No signal?

25:32.333 --> 25:34.625
Well we're clear as
a bell around here.

25:36.959 --> 25:39.249
- I know you have
one, it's urgent.

25:39.250 --> 25:40.542
- Staff only.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.625
(foreboding music)

25:50.583 --> 25:54.542
- Did you ask him
to intimidate us?

25:57.542 --> 26:01.125
- You pushed your
lifestyle down my throat,

26:02.709 --> 26:04.709
but you feel intimidated?

26:05.583 --> 26:09.332
What were you doing
in my son's room?

26:09.333 --> 26:11.667
If anyone deserves
a kicking, it's you.

26:17.458 --> 26:18.582
- Okay we need to
go right the...

26:18.583 --> 26:21.290
Fuck!
(visor buzzing)

26:21.291 --> 26:23.749
- Alright, admittedly
these are a bit niche,

26:23.750 --> 26:26.332
but people use these
all the time on trains

26:26.333 --> 26:27.457
for peace and quiet.

26:27.458 --> 26:28.708
- We're not on a fucking train.

26:28.709 --> 26:29.916
- And technically
they are illegal yes,

26:29.917 --> 26:31.416
but maybe he forgot
to turn it off.

26:31.417 --> 26:33.082
- No Marc, there was a signal
long before he arrived.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.249
So he made a point
of turning it on,

26:35.250 --> 26:37.082
so he can wait
until it gets dark,

26:37.083 --> 26:38.541
so he can slip into
something more comfortable.

26:38.542 --> 26:41.958
(door banging)

26:41.959 --> 26:43.999
(whispering and buzzing)

26:44.000 --> 26:45.374
- No no, leave it on,
he'll know it was us.

26:45.375 --> 26:46.582
- We've gotta call the police.

26:46.583 --> 26:47.417
- It's too late, they won't
be able to get here in time.

26:47.418 --> 26:48.625
- No, Marc!

26:50.166 --> 26:54.332
(bell dinging)

26:54.333 --> 26:55.749
God!

26:55.750 --> 26:59.291
(Fred breathing heavily)

27:05.208 --> 27:06.375
- Thank you.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.290
I know it's wrong, but
seeing you put the wind up them

27:11.291 --> 27:13.125
felt great.

27:15.458 --> 27:16.542
Sleep well.

27:18.333 --> 27:19.542
(speaking Russian)

27:24.792 --> 27:25.750
(door latch clicking)

27:34.166 --> 27:35.916
- No no no, we can get arrested
for wasting police time.

27:35.917 --> 27:36.500
He hasn't done anything!

27:36.501 --> 27:39.792
(Fred breathing heavily)

27:50.250 --> 27:53.792
(feet stomping)

27:58.500 --> 28:00.959
(faint door knocking)

28:10.125 --> 28:13.291
(door latch rattling)

28:18.500 --> 28:22.083
(Alexei speaking Russian)

28:23.792 --> 28:27.082
(door banging loudly)

28:27.083 --> 28:30.709
(Alexei speaking Russian)

28:36.709 --> 28:37.625
(door banging loudly)

28:37.626 --> 28:41.166
(Alexei speaking Russian)

28:48.542 --> 28:52.666
- Let's get out of
range and call a cab.

28:52.667 --> 28:54.499
- Hey, what about the bags?
- Fuck the bags.

28:54.500 --> 28:58.000
(Fred breathing heavily)

29:09.458 --> 29:11.290
- Fred, Fred!

29:11.291 --> 29:12.125
- I can't go
without (indistinct).

29:12.125 --> 29:12.959
- We need to be going now!

29:20.875 --> 29:24.041
(Jeep doors slamming)

29:27.333 --> 29:30.000
(Jeep revving)

29:35.083 --> 29:38.166
(yelling in Russian)

29:39.250 --> 29:42.625
(pulsating dance music)

29:52.625 --> 29:53.708
You really had me going.

29:53.709 --> 29:54.667
- What about Paul?

29:54.668 --> 29:56.666
- Paul prefers Russians.

29:56.667 --> 29:57.417
- Just because
he's not after us,

29:57.418 --> 29:58.457
doesn't mean he's not dangerous.

29:58.458 --> 30:00.791
- Didn't block us in,
didn't stop us leaving.

30:00.792 --> 30:02.082
- Tried to get into our room.

30:02.083 --> 30:04.583
- Tried to get into our room.

30:07.625 --> 30:08.708
- Phone jammer.
- Peace and quiet.

30:08.709 --> 30:10.207
- Infrared goggles.
- It's dark.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.125
- He's not cruising,
he's hunting.

30:11.126 --> 30:13.834
- Well don't tell me, tell dad.

30:14.834 --> 30:16.082
- I don't know if he
knows, but Paul thinks...

30:16.083 --> 30:17.249
- Of course he knows.

30:17.250 --> 30:18.499
Why do you think he's
so fucking furious?

30:18.500 --> 30:19.333
- Marc, this is not
for us to get involved.

30:19.334 --> 30:20.541
- Well according to you,

30:20.542 --> 30:21.582
he's getting driven out
there to get murdered.

30:21.583 --> 30:23.249
What could be more important?

30:23.250 --> 30:24.416
- What if I'm wrong?

30:24.417 --> 30:27.290
I can't just out him.
- You are wrong.

30:27.291 --> 30:29.082
- Where is he taking him?

30:29.083 --> 30:33.542
- Well maybe they've
just gone for a spin.

30:34.625 --> 30:35.999
- We found a phone jammer
and night vision goggles

30:36.000 --> 30:40.249
in his case and a map
of the local park.

30:40.250 --> 30:43.624
- Which your son
filled out for him.

30:43.625 --> 30:45.290
- We think he might have
gone to bash queers.

30:45.291 --> 30:47.792
- Or he might be gay himself.

30:48.667 --> 30:49.083
- The Russian?

30:50.458 --> 30:51.999
(Marc laughing)

30:52.000 --> 30:54.165
- I'm gonna let you
two thrash this out.

30:54.166 --> 30:55.667
I'm going to bed.

30:58.834 --> 31:00.124
If you're worried, why
didn't you call the police?

31:00.125 --> 31:01.666
Oh no but you can't, can you?

31:01.667 --> 31:02.833
You can't have them thinking
your son's a homosexual.

31:02.834 --> 31:04.082
- Do you want us
to go look for him?

31:04.083 --> 31:08.542
- I want you to get your
nose out of my family.

31:09.125 --> 31:11.083
- You heard the man.

31:15.875 --> 31:19.333
(banging and shuffling)

31:32.542 --> 31:35.875
(soft, somber music)

31:43.208 --> 31:44.417
I rest my case.

32:10.083 --> 32:11.792
No one died.
- Marc!

32:13.959 --> 32:18.165
- He came to teach me a lesson.

32:18.166 --> 32:20.291
- Gays are very spiteful.

32:23.625 --> 32:24.833
- If you were hunting gays,

32:24.834 --> 32:25.583
you'd wanna know
where they hang out.

32:25.584 --> 32:27.374
- Oh just admit you're wrong.

32:27.375 --> 32:28.541
- Is Paul in danger?

32:28.542 --> 32:29.250
- Yes, danger of
having a good time.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.083
- Is he gonna get beaten up?

32:30.084 --> 32:34.249
- You'd prefer
that, wouldn't you?

32:34.250 --> 32:35.041
We're done!

32:38.083 --> 32:39.290
- I haven't got a car,

32:39.291 --> 32:40.374
I had to sell it to
pay the legal fees.

32:40.375 --> 32:44.582
- Homophobia can be a
very expensive lifestyle.

32:44.583 --> 32:45.874
- Help me.

32:45.875 --> 32:46.999
- Get a taxi.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.582
- I don't wanna waste any time.

32:48.583 --> 32:50.541
- You don't want anyone to
know where you're going.

32:50.542 --> 32:51.624
You'll still be recognized.

32:51.625 --> 32:53.708
Every faggot in a 50 mile
radius knows who you are.

32:53.709 --> 32:55.375
- Give us a minute.

33:01.834 --> 33:04.624
A teenager looked at me.

33:04.625 --> 33:07.874
Would it be better
if I hadn't told you?

33:07.875 --> 33:09.165
- If it was the
other way around,

33:09.166 --> 33:10.416
do you really think
he would be playing

33:10.417 --> 33:12.040
the Good Samaritan for us?

33:12.041 --> 33:13.207
- Were you ever 16?

33:13.208 --> 33:15.750
- You are such a drama queen.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.291
- And you're a prick.

33:42.041 --> 33:42.917
- You sure it would be
better if I didn't go?

33:42.918 --> 33:44.833
- You mean you thought.

33:44.834 --> 33:48.333
(Marc and Josh grunting)

33:55.709 --> 33:59.208
(Marc breathing heavily)

34:11.333 --> 34:14.125
(door rattling)

34:16.250 --> 34:16.291
- Sorry.

34:21.875 --> 34:25.833
(alcohol trickling)

34:28.542 --> 34:31.666
Did you know when you were 16?

34:31.667 --> 34:32.748
- I knew when I was eight.

34:32.750 --> 34:35.667
- Everybody just knows,

34:37.041 --> 34:39.081
like it's the most natural
thing in the world.

34:39.083 --> 34:42.873
- Unless you decide not to know.

34:42.875 --> 34:46.206
- Anything else I
could support him:

34:46.208 --> 34:47.417
drugs, stealing, murder.

35:06.917 --> 35:10.583
- Tell him that you
love him no matter what.

35:11.417 --> 35:14.917
- There's more to
being a father.

35:15.917 --> 35:18.458
Why am I asking you?

35:22.917 --> 35:24.291
- Just tell him.

35:26.583 --> 35:27.291
- I won't save him.

35:38.208 --> 35:42.875
You think if I had
enough you could turn me?

35:47.959 --> 35:50.958
I don't dislike you, Marc.

35:50.959 --> 35:53.457
You seem like a decent person
beside from this one thing.

35:53.458 --> 35:56.791
- It's not one
thing, it's who I am.

35:56.792 --> 35:58.332
- The first step on any recovery

35:58.333 --> 36:01.999
is you separate who you
are from what you do.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.958
- Can you separate being straight
from being with a woman?

36:04.959 --> 36:07.582
- I haven't been with a
woman since my wife died.

36:07.583 --> 36:09.416
- You think that's
what God wants?

36:09.417 --> 36:11.499
- It wouldn't be fair on Paul.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.749
- And keeping him in the
closet, that is fair?

36:13.750 --> 36:15.541
- He's had girlfriends.
- So have I.

36:15.542 --> 36:17.708
- Then you know, you see?

36:17.709 --> 36:19.625
You know you can do it.

36:22.208 --> 36:24.291
- Do you remember
your first time?

36:29.709 --> 36:30.959
Here's to Paul.

36:34.959 --> 36:38.041
(foreboding music)

36:45.041 --> 36:48.375
(banging and rustling)

36:51.792 --> 36:55.333
(door slamming)

37:26.542 --> 37:29.583
(cellphone alerting)

37:34.208 --> 37:37.333
(foreboding music)

37:51.041 --> 37:54.125
(soft piano music)

39:20.291 --> 39:24.542
(car rumbling)
(brakes squeaking)

39:31.667 --> 39:34.542
(foreboding music)

43:02.000 --> 43:03.709
(visor buzzing)

43:32.291 --> 43:33.250
- Help.

43:35.417 --> 43:38.834
(striking and grunting)

43:42.792 --> 43:44.874
(speaking Russian)

43:44.875 --> 43:48.208
(grunting and wincing)

43:50.959 --> 43:53.249
(speaking Russian)
(wincing and groaning)

43:53.250 --> 43:55.375
- Get off him!

43:55.917 --> 43:58.457
(speaking Russian)

43:58.458 --> 44:02.709
(Fred grunting)
(striking and wincing)

44:07.458 --> 44:10.750
(yelling and grunting)

44:15.959 --> 44:19.082
(water splashing)

44:19.083 --> 44:21.207
(grunting and bashing)

44:21.208 --> 44:22.917
Stop!

44:27.291 --> 44:30.666
(Fred breathing heavily)

44:30.667 --> 44:33.000
(soft, somber music)

44:52.542 --> 44:55.792
(Fred grunting and
breathing heavily)

45:14.917 --> 45:18.040
(keys rattling)

45:18.041 --> 45:19.834
(ominous music)

45:27.041 --> 45:30.583
(Fred breathing heavily)

45:56.667 --> 45:59.750
(tires screeching)

46:02.834 --> 46:05.750
(water splashing)

46:08.417 --> 46:10.875
(Jeep engine roaring)

46:49.709 --> 46:51.916
- Is this private?

46:51.917 --> 46:53.416
- Why were you driving his car?

46:53.417 --> 46:54.208
- You don't need to talk to him.

46:54.209 --> 46:57.124
- My husband went
looking for you.

46:57.125 --> 47:00.457
- (sobs) He's with Alex.

47:00.458 --> 47:04.374
He told me I could borrow his
Jeep if I kept my mouth shut.

47:04.375 --> 47:05.250
- In Russian?

47:05.251 --> 47:07.290
- He speaks English.
- Since when?

47:07.291 --> 47:09.041
- He didn't fancy you.

47:12.291 --> 47:15.290
- That's one toxic little
queen you've spawned there.

47:15.291 --> 47:18.166
(gravel crunching)

47:21.583 --> 47:24.291
(Paul weeping)

47:34.917 --> 47:36.708
Fred!
(Fred crying)

47:36.709 --> 47:37.667
Hey!

47:39.083 --> 47:40.666
Hey, it's okay.

47:40.667 --> 47:43.082
It's okay, it's okay.
(Fred weeping)

47:43.083 --> 47:44.333
Hey, it's okay.

47:45.333 --> 47:47.041
Hey.

47:47.709 --> 47:51.917
(Fred weeping loudly)

47:54.166 --> 47:55.458
Hey, it's okay.

48:01.959 --> 48:03.958
Did he have a knife?

48:03.959 --> 48:05.874
- Didn't need one.

48:05.875 --> 48:08.165
He could've broken my neck.

48:08.166 --> 48:10.582
- All you've got is scratches.

48:10.583 --> 48:11.874
- Don't you believe me?

48:11.875 --> 48:14.374
- I found this in his case.

48:14.375 --> 48:16.999
Now I haven't seen
all of them but,

48:17.000 --> 48:18.708
well, you get the general idea.

48:18.709 --> 48:22.792
(soft, somber music)

48:49.291 --> 48:51.457
He wasn't a queer basher.

48:51.458 --> 48:53.166
He was a Peeping Tom.

49:00.417 --> 49:01.541
- I'm the queer basher.

49:01.542 --> 49:03.249
- No, you haven't done anything.

49:03.250 --> 49:05.457
- You weren't there.

49:05.458 --> 49:07.207
You don't know how it looked.

49:07.208 --> 49:09.332
He wasn't coming in for a snog.

49:09.333 --> 49:12.083
The Peeping Tom
would've run off.

49:14.333 --> 49:18.249
Maybe he doesn't keep the
ones where he beats them up.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.749
- The longer you leave
this, the worse it looks.

49:19.750 --> 49:23.000
It already looks terrible.

49:28.125 --> 49:29.791
- We need to get our
stories straight.

49:29.792 --> 49:31.457
- We don't need a story.

49:31.458 --> 49:32.916
- If you love your husband,

49:32.917 --> 49:34.541
you'll wanna listen before
you call the police.

49:34.542 --> 49:36.124
- Oh now he's my husband?

49:36.125 --> 49:37.208
- Fred, you were right.

49:40.125 --> 49:41.291
He wasn't gay.

49:45.291 --> 49:47.457
He tried to attack Paul.

49:47.458 --> 49:49.499
When he got away, he
looked for someone else.

49:49.500 --> 49:50.750
Paul saved you.

49:58.333 --> 50:01.124
- I think I'd like to hear
this from the horse's mouth.

50:01.125 --> 50:02.916
- I've given him a
sedative, he's exhausted.

50:02.917 --> 50:04.416
- Lying his ass off.

50:04.417 --> 50:06.833
He told me you were trying
to cop-off with the Russian.

50:06.834 --> 50:08.666
- He is a child, he panicked.

50:08.667 --> 50:09.500
- He's old enough
to kill someone,

50:09.501 --> 50:11.708
he's old enough
to answer for it.

50:11.709 --> 50:14.290
- You are so brave.

50:14.291 --> 50:16.165
When it comes to taking
a piss out of a Christian

50:16.166 --> 50:18.040
you know can't fight back,
but when a young man,

50:18.041 --> 50:20.916
a young gay man actually
takes on the real enemy

50:20.917 --> 50:24.250
who tried to kill your husband,
you want him locked up.

50:38.166 --> 50:39.833
- Yes, that's correct.

50:39.834 --> 50:42.250
We draw the line at killing.

50:44.542 --> 50:46.999
Oh, will someone find the
fucking thing and turn it off?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.291
- Use the phone downstairs.

50:56.542 --> 50:57.375
(bottles clinking)

50:57.376 --> 50:58.624
- Where's the phone?

50:58.625 --> 51:00.207
- Last night of freedom.

51:00.208 --> 51:02.416
- You are an innocent bystander.

51:02.417 --> 51:03.749
- If that's how
you wanna play it.

51:03.750 --> 51:05.040
But here's what
Paul's gonna say,

51:05.041 --> 51:06.624
he's gonna say Fred
took him to the park

51:06.625 --> 51:08.541
then got jealous when
he preferred Alex.

51:08.542 --> 51:12.834
There was a fight and
Fred caved his head in.

51:13.959 --> 51:16.040
There's no way anyone
can prove who did what.

51:16.041 --> 51:18.040
Paul is 16, Fred's a grown man

51:18.041 --> 51:21.375
and we all know you came
here looking for a fight.

51:25.959 --> 51:28.291
It's called being a father.

51:29.750 --> 51:30.667
- We'll see him in court.

51:30.668 --> 51:32.290
- No, I will!

51:32.291 --> 51:33.749
- Don't let him...
- This is your fault!

51:33.750 --> 51:34.375
- Boys, keep it down.

51:34.376 --> 51:36.082
- Sit here and listen!

51:36.083 --> 51:37.041
Shut up!

51:45.542 --> 51:50.625
- There is no need to put you
or Paul through any of this.

51:51.792 --> 51:55.040
There's nothing to
connect him with us.

51:55.041 --> 51:56.999
He didn't look, he turned
up out of the blue.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.500
There's nothing on his phone.

52:00.917 --> 52:03.791
He didn't leave a trail because
he came here to bash queers.

52:03.792 --> 52:06.208
Somebody bashed him
first, end of story.

52:08.166 --> 52:09.332
Happy ending.

52:09.333 --> 52:11.417
(glasses clinking)

52:28.834 --> 52:31.124
- He didn't leave a
trail, but we did.

52:31.125 --> 52:33.290
We're booked in the same night

52:33.291 --> 52:35.332
a dead body turns
up five miles away.

52:35.333 --> 52:38.833
- Better make sure it
doesn't turn up then,

52:38.834 --> 52:41.166
at least not around here.

52:47.125 --> 52:48.458
Clock's ticking.

52:51.834 --> 52:54.458
- There'll be forensic evidence.

52:58.625 --> 53:02.207
Paul won't be able to
keep his story straight.

53:02.208 --> 53:04.125
- I helped him do it.

53:05.500 --> 53:07.834
I didn't mean to but I did.

53:09.875 --> 53:12.667
(door rattling)

53:40.875 --> 53:42.791
- You can't move
him by yourself.

53:42.792 --> 53:44.417
- I'm not moving him anywhere.

53:47.250 --> 53:48.417
- We're equal.

53:50.875 --> 53:51.500
We're just like you.

53:51.501 --> 53:53.792
Our love is the same.

53:54.250 --> 53:56.125
We're married.

53:59.125 --> 54:02.500
I would've killed for my wife.

54:03.834 --> 54:05.666
You're not equal.

54:05.667 --> 54:06.583
You're fake.

54:25.792 --> 54:27.125
- I love you.

54:29.917 --> 54:32.750
I'll be back in a
couple of hours.

54:34.709 --> 54:36.249
- We're barely married and
I'm supposedly hooking up

54:36.250 --> 54:37.582
with some weirdo
in night goggles?

54:37.583 --> 54:39.416
Fuck him!

54:39.417 --> 54:41.750
It's my word against his.
- No.

54:42.166 --> 54:43.792
No it isn't.

54:44.750 --> 54:45.917
There's video.

54:48.291 --> 54:50.834
Night goggles, he records it.

54:52.166 --> 54:56.375
We can prove what
happened. (chuckles softly)

54:56.875 --> 54:58.374
(lips smacking)

54:58.375 --> 54:59.833
- Now I'm confused.

54:59.834 --> 55:00.916
If he was gonna attack me,
he wouldn't be recording it.

55:00.917 --> 55:02.833
- No no, I don't think he
was going to attack you.

55:02.834 --> 55:05.124
- Oh so let's hope he was
beaten to death by mistake?

55:05.125 --> 55:08.917
- There is no fucking
pleasing you, is there?

55:13.333 --> 55:14.541
- Stay with Paul.

55:14.542 --> 55:17.958
- We're doing it.
(door slamming)

55:17.959 --> 55:19.207
- Where's this come from?

55:19.208 --> 55:20.833
- Well you.

55:20.834 --> 55:23.499
Richer or poorer,
better or worse.

55:23.500 --> 55:25.624
Nice sermon.
- Fine.

55:25.625 --> 55:26.999
Let's all go to the police.

55:27.000 --> 55:27.917
- We're not going to the police.

55:27.918 --> 55:29.124
- This is how it's gonna be:

55:29.125 --> 55:31.709
one of you stays
or it's the police.

55:32.291 --> 55:32.875
- I now where he is.

55:32.876 --> 55:35.166
- I'm doing it.

55:36.917 --> 55:40.000
- Paul's sedated,
don't wake him up.

55:43.583 --> 55:45.082
- Lock yourself in.

55:45.083 --> 55:46.332
- If you help him move that
body, you're an accomplice.

55:46.333 --> 55:47.916
- I'm not going to touch it.

55:47.917 --> 55:50.499
I'll check the video,
if it proves your clear,

55:50.500 --> 55:51.458
I'll leg it.

55:52.375 --> 55:54.333
- What if it doesn't?

55:55.417 --> 55:56.375
- It will.

55:57.709 --> 56:00.207
- Don't move that
body, promise me.

56:00.208 --> 56:05.375
(engine roaring)
(ominous music)

56:25.291 --> 56:28.000
(Fred weeping)

56:32.750 --> 56:36.250
(Fred breathing heavily)

56:57.834 --> 56:59.625
(ring clinking)

57:07.500 --> 57:11.750
(Fred groaning and
breathing heavily)

57:13.917 --> 57:17.083
(Jeep engine roaring)

57:35.709 --> 57:38.750
(soft, somber music)

58:05.375 --> 58:09.083
(thunder rumbling faintly)

58:23.083 --> 58:26.125
(leaves rustling)

58:49.417 --> 58:52.041
- I have to find Fred's phone.

58:53.458 --> 58:54.833
- Don't you think we should
deal with the dead body first?

58:54.834 --> 58:57.874
- The phone is just as
incriminating for Fred.

58:57.875 --> 59:00.666
- We'll do it later.
- No, now or I walk.

59:00.667 --> 59:02.332
- You want me to do it?

59:02.333 --> 59:05.250
- How do I know
what it looks like?

59:06.875 --> 59:06.917
- Call it.

59:15.375 --> 59:18.625
(cellphone beeping)

59:40.333 --> 59:44.625
(snapping and gasping)

59:47.333 --> 59:50.458
(foreboding music)

59:52.166 --> 59:55.083
(rain pattering)

01:00:11.417 --> 01:00:14.875
(Marc breathing heavily)

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:32.792
- I have to go for a piss.

01:00:34.834 --> 01:00:36.750
- I'm not stopping you.

01:00:38.208 --> 01:00:39.750
Where I can see you.

01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:45.917
(rain pattering)

01:00:52.458 --> 01:00:54.124
I can't go when
you're watching me.

01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:56.917
- If you can't, it
means you don't need to.

01:01:26.542 --> 01:01:29.667
(foreboding music)

01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:07.625
Put it away.

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:38.542
(Paul groaning)

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:43.583
(ominous music)

01:02:43.584 --> 01:02:47.041
(Paul breathing heavily)

01:03:20.542 --> 01:03:22.249
- [Fred Voiceover] You don't
have to go through with it.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.041
(visor buzzing)

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.499
(rock striking)

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.917
(Paul gasping)

01:03:43.542 --> 01:03:47.792
(bags rustling)
(heavy breathing)

01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:56.083
(cellphone ringing)

01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:03.417
- Well take another, go to bed.

01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:10.332
Me and Marc.

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:14.124
We're burying
everything, go to bed.

01:04:14.125 --> 01:04:17.332
- Where are we going to dump it?

01:04:17.333 --> 01:04:18.708
I wanna know where we're going.

01:04:18.709 --> 01:04:20.791
- You're gonna go
back to the house.

01:04:20.792 --> 01:04:22.290
- How are you gonna get back?

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:24.708
- I'm gonna dump the body
and we're gonna dump the Jeep.

01:04:24.709 --> 01:04:25.833
They need to be far apart.

01:04:25.834 --> 01:04:28.999
I shall dump the Jeep tomorrow.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:29.667
- Probably weighs a ton.

01:04:29.668 --> 01:04:31.499
(Jeep door slamming)

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.959
(Jeep engine roaring)

01:04:42.917 --> 01:04:44.749
(feet stomping)

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:47.542
(door knocking)

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:56.917
- I'm not asleep.

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:02.750
- [Paul] I'm sedated
and I can't sleep.

01:05:07.667 --> 01:05:08.625
- What?

01:05:10.709 --> 01:05:13.582
(soft, somber music)

01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:14.542
- Thanks.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.709
You stopped my dad
from going to the park.

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:39.834
- I wish I hadn't.

01:05:44.875 --> 01:05:47.291
- He sent me a text instead.

01:05:48.959 --> 01:05:51.375
You were right, he loves me.

01:05:57.375 --> 01:05:59.875
He's going to see what I did.

01:06:06.041 --> 01:06:08.667
I only wanted what you've got.

01:06:18.917 --> 01:06:21.624
I just don't want
my dad to know.

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:22.834
- Know what?

01:06:26.667 --> 01:06:29.583
- How much I hated him.

01:06:30.917 --> 01:06:33.125
- Who's going to tell him?

01:06:34.375 --> 01:06:36.083
- You,

01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:42.834
and I won't let you.

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:47.500
(door latch rattling)

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:56.875
(brakes squeaking)

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:07.917
Where's my dad?

01:07:07.918 --> 01:07:10.582
- [Marc] Dumping your boyfriend.

01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:13.375
(Jeep rumbling)

01:07:39.125 --> 01:07:42.249
- That was nothing
to do with me.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:44.249
- Let's just see what happened.

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:45.332
(door knocking)

01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:46.374
Fuck off, Paul!

01:07:46.375 --> 01:07:48.291
- [Paul] Give it to me.

01:07:51.125 --> 01:07:53.958
- It must have come
on when he was hit.

01:07:53.959 --> 01:07:58.542
(Alexei yelling in Russian)

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:05.499
- [Paul] Get off him!

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.333
(Alexei yelling in Russian)

01:08:19.582 --> 01:08:21.291
- Stop!

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:24.666
- You said stop.

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.542
- What was Alex saying?

01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:36.041
(Alexei speaking Russian)

01:08:39.875 --> 01:08:42.582
(ominous music)

01:08:42.582 --> 01:08:46.125
(Alexei yelling Russian)

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:02.041
- What the fuck?

01:09:02.917 --> 01:09:05.417
- They were coming to kill him.

01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:07.332
- Shit, shit!

01:09:13.417 --> 01:09:15.957
Okay I'll grab him and you run.

01:09:15.959 --> 01:09:18.375
(door latch rattling)

01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:22.125
Open the fucking door!

01:09:24.959 --> 01:09:27.750
(ominous music)

01:09:52.959 --> 01:09:53.667
You're lighter.

01:09:53.667 --> 01:09:55.333
Go!

01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:05.000
(Fred grunting)

01:10:08.834 --> 01:10:09.792
(fabric ripping)

01:10:09.793 --> 01:10:11.500
No, Fred!

01:10:17.875 --> 01:10:21.333
(Fred gasping)

01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:26.332
(door squeaking)

01:10:26.333 --> 01:10:29.125
(ominous music)

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.333
- [Fred] Go ahead!

01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:02.500
(Fred and Marc
breathing heavily)

01:11:06.291 --> 01:11:09.249
(engine grinding)

01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:11.374
- Oh no no, fuck fuck!

01:11:11.375 --> 01:11:12.749
Fuck fuck, no!

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:14.999
(Marc and Fred panting)

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.791
We cannot stay here.

01:11:16.792 --> 01:11:17.916
- Yes, we can!

01:11:17.917 --> 01:11:20.040
- They might have a shotgun.

01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:21.833
(cellphone ringing)

01:11:21.834 --> 01:11:23.250
Wait, shh shh.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.624
One thing we are not doing
is going back in the house.

01:11:42.625 --> 01:11:43.833
- That has got to be Josh.

01:11:43.834 --> 01:11:45.374
- Do not go in the house, Marc.

01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:47.165
- If Paul was in there, he
would've picked up already.

01:11:47.166 --> 01:11:49.124
- Don't go in, get back!

01:11:49.125 --> 01:11:52.375
(cellphone ringing)

01:12:06.458 --> 01:12:07.333
- Fred!

01:12:07.334 --> 01:12:10.625
(Paul groaning)
(dramatic music)

01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:15.000
- Please don't tell my dad.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:21.667
(Paul gasping)
(Jeep horn beeping)

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.166
(Jeep roaring)

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:29.875
(breaks squeaking)

01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:38.041
- (pants) Phone.

01:12:48.125 --> 01:12:50.165
(cellphone ringing)

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:51.333
- Yes, Marc!

01:12:53.208 --> 01:12:55.374
- [Josh] Open the door.

01:12:55.375 --> 01:12:56.666
- We didn't do it!

01:12:56.667 --> 01:12:57.958
- [Josh] I'm not
blaming you Fred,

01:12:57.959 --> 01:12:59.541
but I need something
to stop the bleeding.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:01.124
- Okay well get us the phone
and we can call an ambulance.

01:13:01.125 --> 01:13:02.083
Hang up.

01:13:03.667 --> 01:13:05.332
- [Josh] An ambulance
takes 20 minutes.

01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:06.000
- The longer you fuck with
us, the longer it will be.

01:13:06.001 --> 01:13:08.165
Get off the line.

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:09.416
- [Josh] I've already
called an ambulance.

01:13:09.417 --> 01:13:11.082
They said, "Get him into the
warmth and stop the bleeding."

01:13:11.083 --> 01:13:11.917
- He's lying.

01:13:11.918 --> 01:13:14.040
- [Josh] If he dies,
it's on you!

01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:14.792
- Okay well, we'll
call the police

01:13:14.792 --> 01:13:15.792
and then we will talk about it.

01:13:15.793 --> 01:13:17.374
- [Josh] He's lost a
lot of blood, please.

01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:19.791
- Look, just get off the line

01:13:19.792 --> 01:13:22.874
so we can talk to
someone that's not you.

01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:23.333
(ominous music)

01:13:23.334 --> 01:13:24.959
Oh, come on.

01:13:26.291 --> 01:13:27.374
- [999 Operator] Emergency
Services Operator,

01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:28.208
which service do you require?

01:13:28.209 --> 01:13:29.708
- Police and ambulance.

01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:31.332
- [999 Operator] And where
are you calling from?

01:13:31.333 --> 01:13:33.499
- It's the St Jude's B&B,
it's on Rafeston Road.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:34.624
- Halsey Road South.

01:13:34.625 --> 01:13:37.958
- Halsey Road South,
there's been a stabbing.

01:13:37.959 --> 01:13:38.542
A suicide attempt.

01:13:40.542 --> 01:13:41.999
Hello?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:42.750
- [999 Operator] We have
a request for an ambulance

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:43.916
at that address.

01:13:43.917 --> 01:13:44.834
- No no no, we still
need the ambulance.

01:13:44.835 --> 01:13:46.082
It's the same incident.

01:13:46.083 --> 01:13:46.959
- Tell 'em to send
a police car first.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.624
- Did you get that?

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:49.583
- [999 Operator] Are the assailants
still on the premises?

01:13:49.584 --> 01:13:50.624
- Oh, come on!

01:13:50.625 --> 01:13:52.249
- We didn't stab anyone,
he did it himself.

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:53.874
- [999 Operator] Have you
brought the victim inside?

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:55.082
- What? No, we're not going to.

01:13:55.083 --> 01:13:56.999
- Why not?
- Because it's complicated.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.332
Can you just tell everyone
to come as soon as they can?

01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:00.374
- [999 Operator] Sir,
it's not complicated.

01:14:00.375 --> 01:14:01.791
He's bleeding heavily
and going into shock.

01:14:01.792 --> 01:14:03.416
- These people are
threatening us.

01:14:03.417 --> 01:14:04.749
- [999 Operator] The
ambulance will be with you

01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:05.709
in under 20 minutes.

01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:07.082
- Well what about the police?

01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:07.959
- [999 Operator]
Paramedics aren't allowed

01:14:07.959 --> 01:14:08.834
to attend unless...

01:14:08.835 --> 01:14:09.916
- Okay how long, how long?

01:14:09.917 --> 01:14:10.917
- [999 Operator]
Police will be with you

01:14:10.918 --> 01:14:12.416
in less than 20 minutes.

01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:13.250
In the meantime, you need
to attend to the victim.

01:14:13.251 --> 01:14:16.582
- We are the victim!

01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:17.624
Fuck!

01:14:17.625 --> 01:14:20.417
(ominous music)

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:28.792
Take over.

01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:33.582
- We need to talk
before they get here.

01:14:33.583 --> 01:14:37.124
(Paul gasping and wincing)

01:14:37.125 --> 01:14:37.709
- I don't trust him.

01:14:37.710 --> 01:14:40.624
(speaks indistinctly)

01:14:40.625 --> 01:14:44.082
- Show it to me, I
wanna see what happened.

01:14:44.083 --> 01:14:44.750
- You'll flush it.

01:14:44.751 --> 01:14:47.417
- I swear on Jesus Christ.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:49.750
On my son's life.

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:51.958
- You can't protect him anymore.

01:14:51.959 --> 01:14:52.792
- He's my son!

01:14:52.792 --> 01:14:53.709
- He wanted you dead.

01:14:58.208 --> 01:15:01.417
It was supposed to be you.

01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:03.624
The plastic sheet,
it was for you.

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:04.749
You drove him to it.
- No, he's not gay.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.249
He told me he couldn't
go through with it.

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:08.417
- Killing you!

01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:13.625
That's what he couldn't
go through with.

01:15:16.291 --> 01:15:19.374
- (sighs) Is there
anything I can do?

01:15:19.375 --> 01:15:20.333
He's 16.

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:22.666
I'll do anything.

01:15:22.667 --> 01:15:23.417
You want me on my
knees, I'm on my knees.

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:25.499
He tried to kill himself.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.500
What more do you want?

01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:29.875
Can't you forgive him?

01:15:29.876 --> 01:15:31.082
- It's not my call.

01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:31.709
- I forgive him.

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.499
- Of being a murderer
or being a faggot?

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:40.291
(head smacking)

01:15:50.417 --> 01:15:53.083
(Paul wincing)

01:15:58.417 --> 01:16:01.333
- Don't let him see it.

01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:04.874
(soft somber music)

01:16:04.875 --> 01:16:06.625
- This is the house.

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:15.834
You check-in here.

01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:20.417
Bedroom's upstairs.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.000
Dad's room.

01:16:49.125 --> 01:16:50.834
My room.

01:17:28.125 --> 01:17:31.500
(Paul speaking Russian)

01:17:55.792 --> 01:17:57.792
(toilet flushing)

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:01.959
- Son.

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.332
(gurgling)

01:18:08.333 --> 01:18:10.500
- [Fred] Marc?

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.458
Marc!

01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:15.457
(visor buzzing)

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:16.417
Marc!

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.834
(Fred breathing heavily)

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:27.249
(men speaking Russian)

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:28.791
- [Josh] They've been
harassing us for years.

01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:31.791
Shit in our letterbox,
death threats.

01:18:31.792 --> 01:18:34.958
They got some Russian
thug to join in.

01:18:34.959 --> 01:18:36.333
That's his Jeep.

01:18:39.041 --> 01:18:40.791
(speaks indistinctly)

01:18:40.792 --> 01:18:42.457
...one of them means
to kill him or not.

01:18:42.458 --> 01:18:45.709
They didn't
give a knife to Paul.

01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:50.374
- Marc!

01:18:50.375 --> 01:18:53.917
(Marc breathing heavily)

01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:56.875
- [Marc] Fred!

01:19:01.208 --> 01:19:03.834
(Marc screaming)

01:19:05.291 --> 01:19:08.000
(Marc grunting)

01:19:09.208 --> 01:19:12.250
(soft, somber music)

01:19:26.291 --> 01:19:29.125
(CB radio chatter)

01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:35.917
(thunder rumbling)

01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:36.250
(soft, somber music)

01:21:31.208 --> 01:21:33.125
(birds chirping)

01:21:40.959 --> 01:21:43.667
(bell dinging)

01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:12.875
- [Paul] So.

01:22:14.792 --> 01:22:17.249
- You're not gay anymore?

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:18.709
- He's in prison.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.875
- Anything else?

01:22:25.291 --> 01:22:26.083
- You won't be
able to keep it up.

01:22:26.084 --> 01:22:28.207
- Hasn't been a problem so far.

01:22:28.208 --> 01:22:31.749
- Let's go, you can't
save other people.

01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:34.083
- My dad saved me.

01:22:36.083 --> 01:22:38.208
(soft piano music)

01:22:50.083 --> 01:22:52.207
(jail gate banging)

01:22:52.208 --> 01:22:55.958
- [Josh] Bless me Father,
for I have sinned.

01:22:55.959 --> 01:22:59.709
It's good to talk to
someone who understands.

01:23:02.125 --> 01:23:06.208
It's not blackmail if that's
the only way to rescue someone.

01:23:07.542 --> 01:23:11.457
I'm not saving him from prison,
I'm saving him from Hell.

01:23:11.458 --> 01:23:14.834
Five years is nothing
against eternity.

01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:26.249
He might feel it's
fake at first,

01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:28.542
but God can open any heart.

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:32.499
The longer he walks the path,

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:33.208
the more he'll learn

01:23:35.083 --> 01:23:36.125
what love is.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:40.500
Real love.

01:23:43.959 --> 01:23:47.250
(soft, rhythmic music)

01:24:13.667 --> 01:24:17.208
(ominous music)

01:25:44.458 --> 01:25:47.417
(soft, piano music)

01:25:48.305 --> 01:25:54.575
