WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:02.794
- Previously on Being Human...

00:02.830 --> 00:04.059
- No reunions.

00:04.100 --> 00:07.070
No people from her past.
That's the catch.

00:07.100 --> 00:08.568
- Sally? It's Trent.

00:08.600 --> 00:11.103
- This is why you can't see
anyone from your past.

00:11.140 --> 00:12.801
They'll die.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.330
- There was this flu,

00:14.380 --> 00:16.803
and if you drink the blood
of someone who had it,

00:16.850 --> 00:18.375
it wipes out vampires.

00:18.410 --> 00:20.970
- This is my girlfriend, Emma.
- I never got that flu.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.818
- (Henry):
Emma will feed you.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.215
- I'm gonna die in here.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.252
- I let her go.
- What is wrong with you?

00:26.290 --> 00:29.089
- I'm gonna ask
Nora to marry me.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.280
- Josh, you should've--

00:31.330 --> 00:32.957
- I'm Liam McLean,

00:33.000 --> 00:34.627
Connor and Brynn's father.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.367
(Nora gasps,
Brynn screams)

00:39.400 --> 00:41.334
I came to find her.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.508
- Nora!

00:44.540 --> 00:45.610
Oh no!

00:48.880 --> 00:50.700
(Birds chirping,
children playing)

00:55.050 --> 00:57.485
- You could've
killed me last night.

00:58.290 --> 01:00.918
- Putting you
through your paces.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.280
Exercise.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.583
- You ripped open a metal door
with your teeth.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.725
Then you were bleeding and
coming at me and--

01:07.760 --> 01:11.094
- We're wolves, Nora.
It's what we do.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.159
And why would
I wanna hurt you?

01:15.200 --> 01:18.500
You're the closest link
I have to Brynn.

01:19.310 --> 01:20.778
You're like kin.

01:21.580 --> 01:24.641
Those like us
need to stick together.

01:25.850 --> 01:28.444
- What if I had attacked you?

01:28.480 --> 01:30.915
- Humans are the only
animal with a death wish.

01:30.950 --> 01:34.159
You're more wolf than that.

01:36.460 --> 01:40.658
There's no worse sin than
turning on one of your own.

01:51.340 --> 01:53.877
- Yeah, I called the police
and the fire department,

01:53.910 --> 01:55.173
which I really don't get,

01:55.210 --> 01:56.803
because she didn't
disappear in a fire.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.410
And now I'm calling your
delightful hospital.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.346
I'm not being snippy.

02:01.380 --> 02:02.814
I think you're
being snippy.

02:02.850 --> 02:04.818
- Sally! Focus.

02:06.690 --> 02:09.387
- That's right,
Nora Sergeant.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.149
No, no.
Thank you.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.667
- OK, I'm assuming
that was a no.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.237
So that's every hospital
within 60 miles.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.863
Where next? The Cape?

02:21.970 --> 02:23.563
- Can wolves swim?

02:23.610 --> 02:24.600
(Door opens)

02:24.640 --> 02:27.200
- (Nora): Josh?
Hey!

02:27.240 --> 02:29.004
- Oh my God!

02:29.040 --> 02:30.303
- Hi...
- Are you OK?

02:30.350 --> 02:32.444
- Yeah. I'm fine.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.449
(Sighs)

02:36.520 --> 02:38.682
- I went to
the storage unit.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.553
After everything
we've been through, I can't...

02:41.590 --> 02:43.354
- It's OK.

02:43.390 --> 02:44.653
- But what if
it weren't?

02:44.690 --> 02:47.455
- Can we worry about
that another time?

02:48.430 --> 02:50.728
Because the twins
have a dad.

02:51.570 --> 02:53.493
And he wants answers.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.350
(Chuckles)

03:04.380 --> 03:06.678
- Just when I had
a shred of hope,

03:06.720 --> 03:07.744
you got me again.

03:07.780 --> 03:10.112
- You know,
you are a fast learner.

03:10.150 --> 03:11.515
- Oh...

03:11.550 --> 03:13.382
- You're gonna beat me
at this thing one day.

03:13.420 --> 03:14.649
- I doubt that
very much.

03:14.690 --> 03:16.385
Hey, Theo, are you hungry?
- Mmm...

03:16.430 --> 03:18.023
- Let me take you
out to lunch.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.459
Oh, come on!

03:19.500 --> 03:21.150
It's the least I can do
after the free lesson.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.395
- You really
don't have to.

03:22.430 --> 03:23.693
- Come on. I insist.
- Really?

03:23.730 --> 03:26.438
- Come on! Yeah.
- All right.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.234
- Theo! Shortcut.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.936
- (Theo):
No!' ey'

03:37.310 --> 03:38.948
Please!

03:41.850 --> 03:43.944
- You won't feel a thing.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.057
<i>(Theo sneezes,
Henry exclaims)</i>

03:48.090 --> 03:50.081
Get out of here.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.895
Get out before
I snap your stem!

03:58.800 --> 04:00.268
You're kidding me.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.369
- Look, Henry.

04:09.410 --> 04:11.572
That was probably
just a cold. T'll--

04:11.610 --> 04:14.250
- You have no idea
what you're talking about!

04:14.280 --> 04:16.442
You were buried when
the flu hit them.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.844
When the virus got us.

04:17.890 --> 04:21.656
You didn't have to watch
everyone you know die.

04:21.690 --> 04:24.057
One day they're fine,
the next they're gone.

04:24.090 --> 04:25.319
- I'm sure it was awful,

04:25.360 --> 04:27.328
but we can learn
from their mistakes.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.261
- It already takes
weeks -- weeks --

04:30.300 --> 04:33.270
chatting up losers
for one clean pint.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.893
- Keep your voice down.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.601
- What about the dentist
we got Tuesday?

04:39.640 --> 04:41.108
- Hey! What did I tell you?

04:41.140 --> 04:42.642
Until we kill him?

04:42.680 --> 04:44.648
Or until you compel him
enough to fry his brain? No!

04:44.680 --> 04:45.806
- I'll find
a better way.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.818
- I already had
a better way!

04:47.850 --> 04:48.920
Her name was Emma.

04:48.950 --> 04:52.011
She was pretty!
She smelled like vanilla.

04:52.050 --> 04:53.484
And you let her go!

04:53.520 --> 04:55.181
- Hurry up and do it.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.726
- Are we ever gonna
stop talking about this?

04:58.760 --> 04:59.830
She was a slave.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.794
What, you gotta torture
some poor girl

05:01.830 --> 05:02.820
just to survive?

05:04.170 --> 05:05.365
No!

05:05.400 --> 05:07.334
We're better
than that.

05:08.340 --> 05:09.899
- Maybe you are.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.001
- As long as you're my son,
you are too.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.839
- I can't do this anymore.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.281
I'm done trolling around
for one clean drop.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.379
I'm done starving
every day.

05:25.420 --> 05:28.014
I'm done with--
- Me?

05:32.290 --> 05:34.099
- I didn't say that.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.859
- Just stay focused.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.164
There's healthy blood
out there.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.066
It's a numbers game.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.566
Tons of people got sick,

05:45.610 --> 05:46.680
plenty didn't.

05:46.710 --> 05:48.405
I'll find
the healthy blood.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.102
All you gotta do
is just trust me.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.345
(Sighs)

05:52.380 --> 05:53.870
OK?

06:02.120 --> 06:03.519
Henry...

06:04.390 --> 06:05.926
Come on.

06:17.670 --> 06:19.604
- You need to
snap out of it.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.732
- I'm hungry.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.407
- They're empty
calories, Sally!

06:22.450 --> 06:24.179
- Everything I eat
is empty calories.

06:24.210 --> 06:25.405
Nothing sticks.

06:25.450 --> 06:27.646
I had 2 whole chickens
last night.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.079
And a tub of ice cream.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.849
The kind with a handle.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.654
I'm just stress-eating.
- I know.

06:32.690 --> 06:34.283
- What am
I supposed to do?

06:34.320 --> 06:35.856
Every time
I leave the house,

06:35.890 --> 06:37.528
I'm afraid
I'll kill somebody.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.119
I have no identity.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.869
And I can't stop
thinking about poor Trent.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.868
- Ah, well here's
a solution for you.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.096
Maybe you could stop
thinking about him

06:47.140 --> 06:49.336
if you didn't have
a Google alert for

06:49.370 --> 06:50.599
"Trent + Harris + dead."

06:50.640 --> 06:52.108
- OK, so you saw that.
- Yes!

06:52.140 --> 06:54.871
- Then you know his memorial
service is coming up.

06:54.910 --> 06:56.947
I think I should go.
- That's a great idea.

06:56.980 --> 06:58.869
If you wanna Kill
half your yearbook.

06:58.910 --> 07:00.878
- Because Trent's
friends and classmates

07:00.920 --> 07:03.116
are also your friends
and classmates,

07:03.150 --> 07:04.709
so they see you,
they die.

07:04.750 --> 07:08.550
- Yes, OK, but what if his ghost
is there and I can speak to him?

07:08.590 --> 07:09.989
He's probably scared.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.351
I didn't know anything
about being a ghost

07:12.390 --> 07:13.994
until I met you and Aidan.

07:14.030 --> 07:15.156
I put him there.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.259
The least I can do
is help him move on.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.632
- Sally, you can't go, OK?

07:20.640 --> 07:22.130
You know that.

07:22.170 --> 07:25.708
And also, selfishly...

07:25.740 --> 07:28.710
I need more
normal in my life

07:28.740 --> 07:31.971
if I'm ever going to
ask Nora to marry me.

07:32.950 --> 07:36.113
And that includes you
not killing anybody.

07:36.150 --> 07:37.686
- I totally hear you.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.381
- Could you stop eating this?

07:39.420 --> 07:41.149
It's terrible for you.

07:49.430 --> 07:51.421
It's unbelievable.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.097
All day!

07:53.140 --> 07:54.790
(Laughs,
sighs)

07:54.840 --> 07:57.138
- I know you've got
a ton on your plate,

07:57.170 --> 07:58.535
but I could use a favour.

07:58.570 --> 08:00.504
- Sure you could. Shoot.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.679
- Finding clean blood,
it has been, uh...

08:02.710 --> 08:05.304
a lot tougher than
I thought and, well,

08:05.350 --> 08:08.274
you're pulling some shifts
in admitting, right?

08:08.320 --> 08:09.788
- Yeah...

08:09.820 --> 08:12.187
- So do you think that, maybe,
when a patient comes in,

08:12.220 --> 08:14.416
you could ask a couple
of extra questions

08:14.460 --> 08:16.189
to see if
they had this flu?

08:16.220 --> 08:18.723
- So you want me
to screen my patients,

08:18.760 --> 08:20.159
and then hand them
over to you

08:20.200 --> 08:23.090
so that you and
Henry can suck them dry?

08:23.130 --> 08:25.622
- Josh, that's not it.
- It's not?

08:25.670 --> 08:26.899
- No sucking dry.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.294
No, we take a pint,
maybe two.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.559
Henry compels them,
bing, bang, boom, done!

08:30.610 --> 08:31.907
Strictly catch
and release.

08:31.940 --> 08:33.635
- Because that worked so well

08:33.679 --> 08:37.469
with the 2 party girls upstairs
who ended up dead in your room?

08:37.510 --> 08:40.150
You promised me, Aidan,

08:40.179 --> 08:42.068
never again.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.339
- Henry is, uh...

08:45.450 --> 08:47.953
He's much better at
compelling than I am.

08:47.990 --> 08:49.856
He's not gonna
mess up like I did.

08:49.890 --> 08:52.723
- So let me get this straight.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.390
Sally needs me to work 2 jobs
in order to keep her fed

08:56.430 --> 08:58.922
and you want me
to risk losing

08:58.970 --> 09:01.337
the one job
that I have

09:01.370 --> 09:02.735
to feed you.

09:02.770 --> 09:05.034
- I know what I'm asking.

09:05.070 --> 09:07.107
But I'm running out
of options.

09:07.140 --> 09:08.972
Please.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.645
- (Nora):
I hope you said no!

09:12.680 --> 09:14.375
- Of course
I said no.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.446
- I mean, it was one thing when
you used to be one of us.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.185
- I'm still one of you.
- No!

09:19.220 --> 09:20.779
Now you're better.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.982
You have your life back.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.328
And now he's trying to
drag you down into his.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.589
- No. No.

09:26.630 --> 09:28.758
I made it very clear.

09:29.730 --> 09:32.563
Only Nora gets
to do that.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.629
(Laughs)

09:34.670 --> 09:36.138
That hurt.

09:36.170 --> 09:37.604
(Laughs)

10:08.840 --> 10:10.308
- (Sally):
Hey, Trent.

10:12.310 --> 10:13.630
- Sally...

10:13.680 --> 10:15.205
(Sighs)

10:15.240 --> 10:18.210
What I wouldn't give to just
talk to you one more time.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.912
- Oh, sorry,
I should've clarified.

10:20.950 --> 10:22.145
You can.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.682
- You can see me?

10:23.720 --> 10:25.449
Wait, why--why
can you see me?

10:25.490 --> 10:28.312
- Because I was a ghost too.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.350
- What?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.052
You---

10:33.300 --> 10:35.291
But I--I kissed you.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.992
- Yeah. Yeah, you did.

10:38.030 --> 10:40.340
Um, and about that, um...

10:40.370 --> 10:42.293
OK, well,

10:42.340 --> 10:43.865
after Danny murdered me,

10:43.910 --> 10:45.901
I spent some time ghosting,

10:45.940 --> 10:48.580
then limbo -- don't
recommend it --

10:48.610 --> 10:50.840
and, uh, a witch
brought me back

10:50.880 --> 10:53.520
as what you kissed.

10:53.550 --> 10:54.813
- Oh!

10:54.850 --> 10:56.716
Hey, go back to
that witch part, um...

10:56.750 --> 10:58.240
Can I come back, too?

10:58.290 --> 11:01.180
- Well, there's some
fine print that's not so great.

11:01.220 --> 11:02.449
- Like?

11:02.490 --> 11:03.924
- Like you kill everybody

11:03.960 --> 11:05.587
from your past
that you see.

11:05.630 --> 11:06.950
- Ah... OK.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.725
OK, so you were
warned by a witch

11:10.770 --> 11:12.499
not to see anybody
from your past...

11:12.530 --> 11:13.998
- I wasn't warned personally,

11:14.040 --> 11:16.338
and--and it's--
She's not a witch, per se.

11:16.370 --> 11:19.067
- ...but you still tried
to make out with me?

11:19.110 --> 11:20.009
(Sighs)

11:20.040 --> 11:21.599
- I-- You know,
I think that

11:21.640 --> 11:23.142
you tried to
make out with me,

11:23.180 --> 11:25.740
but, um, look,
I feel awful.

11:25.780 --> 11:28.272
- OK. 'Cause
you should feel awful.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.745
Um, because you're
a horrible, heartless bitch!

11:31.790 --> 11:33.884
- That's a little
uncalled for.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.582
I would never
knowingly hurt somebody.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.987
- You kind of killed me.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.552
- Uh, excuse me, Ma'am?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.090
You're not allowed
down here.

11:43.130 --> 11:44.120
<i>- Ma'a
me?</i>

11:44.170 --> 11:45.660
- You're a lot older
than you look.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.099
- Could I have
5 more minutes?

11:47.140 --> 11:49.962
- There's gonna be
a memorial service for that.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.433
- It's just that, um,
Trent's parents and I,

11:52.470 --> 11:53.778
we don't really get along.

11:53.810 --> 11:56.370
- You don't even
know my family.

11:56.410 --> 11:57.480
What's my mom's name?

11:57.510 --> 11:59.205
- So maybe I could--
You know, I just--

11:59.250 --> 12:01.469
They probably don't
want me at the service,

12:01.520 --> 12:04.581
So I figured I'd come here and
say goodbye to my old friend.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.782
- Wow. Are you ever
not lying?

12:06.820 --> 12:08.584
- I'm sure
he knows you care...

12:08.620 --> 12:10.520
- About yourself!

12:10.560 --> 12:11.982
- ...but rules are rules.

12:12.030 --> 12:14.249
- OK.
- Thank you. Come on.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.699
(Inaudible)

12:15.730 --> 12:17.220
- Please, no.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.930
- (Man): Look, I'm not trying
to start anything.

12:20.970 --> 12:22.267
- (Girl): Shut up!

12:22.300 --> 12:23.335
- Erin Shepherd?

12:23.370 --> 12:25.134
- Please don't
speak to me like that.

12:25.170 --> 12:27.104
- Keep looking at me,
see how this ends.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.938
- Erin Shepherd?
Is everything OK?

12:28.980 --> 12:31.540
- I left for 2 seconds,
he changed the channel.

12:31.580 --> 12:32.672
- She walked away.

12:32.710 --> 12:33.848
- This isn't
a prison yard--

12:33.880 --> 12:35.917
- No! Make him
change it back!

12:35.950 --> 12:38.214
- Why don't you
come with me? Sorry, sir.

12:39.420 --> 12:42.287
- Just give me some antibiotics
and let me get out of here.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.084
- Well, we need to
admit you first,

12:44.130 --> 12:45.780
and you left half
this form blank.

12:45.830 --> 12:46.922
Here, come in here.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.826
- I didn't know
all the answers.

12:48.860 --> 12:51.090
- Like your address
and phone number?

12:51.130 --> 12:53.497
- I know my rights.
I don't have to give you that.

12:53.540 --> 12:57.238
- OK, how about your
parents' contact information?

12:58.070 --> 13:00.300
- I don't know.
- Really?

13:00.340 --> 13:01.273
- Yes, really.

13:01.310 --> 13:03.779
We could ask their
meth dealer.

13:03.810 --> 13:07.110
He sees them a lot
more than I do.

13:07.150 --> 13:10.085
Look, this thing's been
killing me for weeks.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.109
Can I see
a doctor or not?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.912
- Well, what's,
um, what's wrong?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.257
- Some kind of infection.

13:16.290 --> 13:18.588
Keeps getting worse.
Hurts like a mother.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.621
- How did it start?

13:20.660 --> 13:22.059
- I was out with my boyfriend.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.465
Came home by the tracks

13:23.500 --> 13:25.423
when this crazy-ass dog
came out of nowhere.

13:25.470 --> 13:28.531
It was a full moon,
so I could see pretty well.

13:28.570 --> 13:31.130
- I--I need you
to describe the dog.

13:31.170 --> 13:32.877
- It didn't
look like a dog.

13:32.910 --> 13:36.471
But it was huge and
mangy and built like a--

13:36.510 --> 13:37.978
- Wolf?

13:38.010 --> 13:39.808
- I guess, yeah.

13:39.850 --> 13:41.841
Scratched the hell
out of me.

13:50.890 --> 13:52.528
- How bad is it?

13:55.660 --> 13:57.094
- Maybe it was
just a dog.

13:57.130 --> 13:59.622
- No, she was attacked
during the last full moon.

13:59.670 --> 14:01.138
The way she described it,

14:01.170 --> 14:03.207
there's no way
it was just a dog.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.765
- How long can
she stay here?

14:04.810 --> 14:06.460
- I had to lie just
to get her a bed.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.979
I called DCF and foster care.
She's on record now.

14:09.010 --> 14:11.149
The social worker
must be on the way.

14:12.610 --> 14:14.578
- (Nora): Yeah,
but what if she isn't?

14:14.620 --> 14:16.987
We can't just drop her
in the middle of Boston

14:17.020 --> 14:18.112
this close to the turn.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.584
- She can't be here, Nora.

14:19.620 --> 14:23.181
We have, like, what,
a day until it happens?

14:23.230 --> 14:25.358
We have to tell her.

14:26.830 --> 14:29.424
- I used to be her, Josh.

14:32.270 --> 14:34.796
She's not ready
to hear it.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.569
- No one is.

14:39.510 --> 14:40.534
Come on.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.207
- No, just wait.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.076
Let's just give
her the day.

14:45.110 --> 14:47.647
- What if she splits in
the middle of the night?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.045
- Look at her.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.218
Her own room,

14:50.250 --> 14:52.981
meals delivered to her bed?

14:53.020 --> 14:54.715
After what she's used to?

14:54.760 --> 14:56.057
(Scoffs)

14:56.090 --> 14:59.219
When you turned, you had
no idea what was coming.

15:00.260 --> 15:01.523
I did.

15:02.530 --> 15:04.464
And it wrecked me.

15:06.940 --> 15:10.103
In a day, this life
ends for her.

15:10.140 --> 15:13.599
Let the girl have cable
and bad hospital food.

15:26.690 --> 15:29.011
- No, let's not
do that.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.380
- You don't get it.
I love her.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.250
- You love the vein
she'd open for you.

15:32.290 --> 15:35.351
- We had something.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.320
- OK, I'm sure after
walking around

15:39.370 --> 15:41.862
in this Petri dish
of influenza,

15:41.900 --> 15:43.868
her blood's still clean.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.162
Who am I to stop true love?

15:45.210 --> 15:47.508
So by all means, go to her.

15:48.980 --> 15:50.607
(Exhales loudly)

15:51.480 --> 15:53.642
- Have you talked
to your roommate?

15:55.050 --> 15:57.041
- Yeah, of course.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.683
I'm on it.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.744
- That's a "no."

15:59.790 --> 16:00.882
Good old Josh,

16:00.920 --> 16:02.410
self-righteous as ever.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.350
I'm so damn hungry.
I can't keep going.

16:05.390 --> 16:09.156
- You can. Henry,
I know it hurts.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.565
I was dry for
over a year.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.624
I couldn't think.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.934
I was pretty damn sure
I couldn't go on,

16:13.970 --> 16:15.233
But I did.
You will too.

16:15.270 --> 16:17.432
- Stop saying that.

16:17.470 --> 16:18.232
I was there.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.079
I saw friends like me,

16:20.110 --> 16:21.908
better than me,
stronger than me...

16:21.940 --> 16:23.169
They're all dust now.

16:23.210 --> 16:25.201
- No, they were not
better than you.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.639
They were weak
and they gave in.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.217
You, Henry,

16:30.250 --> 16:32.446
you have untapped
power and strength

16:32.490 --> 16:34.549
and I've always known this.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.281
Even when you didn't.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.525
- (Erin): Get away from me!
- (Woman): Listen to me!

16:42.560 --> 16:44.164
- No!

16:44.200 --> 16:45.929
- Whoa! Whoa!

16:45.970 --> 16:47.233
What is going
on in here?

16:47.270 --> 16:48.795
- I'm from DCF.
I'm Erin's caseworker.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.662
You had a nice run,
now let's get you out of here.

16:51.710 --> 16:52.768
- No, she's a patient.

16:52.810 --> 16:53.936
- I talked
to the doctor.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.334
He said she could
be released.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.474
Erin's a pro
at malingering.

16:57.510 --> 16:59.148
- No, she's not.
She's sick.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.375
- She snowed you quick.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.013
- Don't send me
back to that home.

17:02.050 --> 17:03.017
- Don't worry!

17:03.050 --> 17:04.483
They won't have you.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.989
Not after you stole $300
and smacked their grandson.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.112
- It wasn't my fault!

17:08.160 --> 17:09.388
- It never is!

17:09.420 --> 17:11.923
That makes
27 homes in 2 years.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.497
- Maybe if you stopped placing
me with Holy Rollers

17:14.530 --> 17:17.227
or a bunch of bad-touch
brothers I'd have a chance.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.592
- Erin, calm down.
- Fine. I'll try again.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.868
Now get your things.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.265
- She's not leaving.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.607
- That's not your call.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.665
- A few notes on
her chart and it is my call.

17:26.710 --> 17:29.031
We can run some tests,
check for abuse.

17:29.080 --> 17:33.074
It doesn't sound like she has
a reliable caretaker at home.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.980
- You wanna play it
that way? Fine.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.647
She's your problem now.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.895
- We've already falsified
enough records to get fired.

17:48.930 --> 17:50.159
- She should stay with us.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.396
Just through
her first turn.

17:52.430 --> 17:54.831
- Are you-- Did you hear
her social worker?

17:54.870 --> 17:56.269
I mean, she'll--she'll...

17:56.300 --> 17:58.735
She's gonna cut us
in our sleep.

17:58.770 --> 18:00.477
With a shank
or a shiv or... Shank?

18:00.510 --> 18:03.400
- I--I think
they're both acceptable.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.670
- And Aidan's at home,
and he's not exactly stable,

18:06.710 --> 18:08.815
and you see how
this is getting complicated?

18:08.850 --> 18:11.012
- If you think that
she's so awful,

18:11.050 --> 18:12.779
then what do you
think of me?

18:13.590 --> 18:15.615
- Nora, you're
nothing like her.

18:15.660 --> 18:18.550
- I'm closer than
you want to admit.

18:18.590 --> 18:21.457
- My wolf did terrible things

18:21.500 --> 18:23.628
because I had
terrible things done to me.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.924
Everything I stood there and
took couldn't wait to come out.

18:27.870 --> 18:30.168
You don't wanna
think that I'm like her,

18:30.210 --> 18:31.803
but I am.

18:34.210 --> 18:35.769
- There's no good answer.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.574
- No...

18:37.610 --> 18:40.272
But she's turning
tomorrow, no matter what.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.845
And we're running out of time.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.520
If we don't help her,
then what else is there?

18:44.550 --> 18:46.848
What, you wanna
put her down?

18:48.760 --> 18:50.922
- You actually thought about it!
- I didn't.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.122
- If you'd seen me
out there with Brynn,

18:53.160 --> 18:54.457
would you have put me down?

18:54.500 --> 18:56.252
- Come on, Nora, seriously--

18:56.300 --> 18:57.790
- I'm not saying
that we adopt her.

18:57.830 --> 19:00.470
But she needs
someone who understands

19:00.500 --> 19:01.831
what she's going through.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.702
And like it or not,

19:03.740 --> 19:05.469
that's us.

19:05.510 --> 19:08.434
- (Woman on PA):
Alec Dumont, extension 3105.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.699
- All right.
- OK.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.706
- All right.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.616
We'll check her out
after our shifts

19:13.650 --> 19:16.574
and we'll show her
what she's about to become.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.995
- So I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

19:32.830 --> 19:34.867
- Oh, you mean
because you killed me?

19:34.900 --> 19:37.699
What part of "rest in peace”
don't you understand, Sally?

19:37.740 --> 19:39.333
- Just let me
make it up to you.

19:39.370 --> 19:40.804
I've been where you are.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.877
You probably have
a lot of questions.

19:42.910 --> 19:45.504
- Yeah, like: "Why me?
Why did I have to die?"

19:45.550 --> 19:47.712
- I'm sorry that
you're here, but--

19:47.750 --> 19:50.685
OK, you may not
have to be for long.

19:51.750 --> 19:52.820
Every ghost,

19:52.850 --> 19:54.579
they're waiting
on their door.

19:54.620 --> 19:57.260
- Sally, I've been
haunting a funeral home.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.883
You can't turn a corner

19:58.930 --> 20:01.524
without a ghost blah, blah,
blah-ing on about their door.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.119
- OK, then you know
about the door,

20:03.160 --> 20:05.925
so we just have to figure out
how to get you yours.

20:05.970 --> 20:09.793
Every ghost that's waiting has
some sort of unresolved issues.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.569
We have to figure out
what yours is.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.079
- I know exactly
what mine is.

20:14.110 --> 20:16.135
- You do?
- Yeah...

20:16.180 --> 20:17.648
I, um...

20:18.450 --> 20:20.418
I made out with you

20:20.450 --> 20:24.080
when I should've been
home with my fiance.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.986
- Fiance?

20:26.020 --> 20:29.354
You had a fiance and
you're making out with me?

20:29.390 --> 20:31.757
- You killed me, all right?
Save the outrage.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.554
Look,

20:33.600 --> 20:35.022
it'd be very helpful

20:35.060 --> 20:37.563
if you could make
things right with Candace.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.726
- OK.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.568
- She's gonna be at
the memorial service.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.432
- Right.

20:42.470 --> 20:45.565
But I--I can't be.

20:46.570 --> 20:49.130
- Or everyone
you know ends up dead.

20:49.180 --> 20:50.238
Well, once again,

20:50.280 --> 20:52.009
really helpful chat, Sally.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.478
(Sighs)

20:55.280 --> 20:57.886
- No, Trent,

20:57.920 --> 20:59.911
I will do this.

20:59.950 --> 21:01.952
I'm gonna do it.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.584
OK, I just--

21:05.630 --> 21:07.291
I might need a little help.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.867
- (Josh): Excuse me...

21:15.900 --> 21:17.459
Those are patient files.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.137
You can't look at--

21:19.170 --> 21:20.808
- Not that hard, is it?

21:22.040 --> 21:24.008
- You can't be here.

21:24.780 --> 21:26.509
- I know you and Aidan talked.

21:26.550 --> 21:27.915
He asked you
for one thing.

21:27.950 --> 21:31.284
Send a few prescreened
mouth-breathers our way.

21:31.320 --> 21:32.640
- You think
I'm being selfish?

21:32.690 --> 21:34.613
No one knows more
about that than you.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.412
- You don't care about Aidan.

21:36.460 --> 21:38.656
You got your life back,
so screw him.

21:38.690 --> 21:42.194
- Stop trying to sell this whole
"concerned friend" shtick.

21:42.230 --> 21:45.393
You're looking out for yourself,
just like you always have.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.694
- And you're not?

21:47.740 --> 21:50.038
You have no idea what
Aidan's going through. I do.

21:50.070 --> 21:53.108
- I'm not gonna argue about
who had it worse, all right?

21:53.140 --> 21:54.232
I've been there, too.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.679
- And the second
you got cured,

21:55.710 --> 21:57.678
you turned
your back on him.

21:57.710 --> 22:02.113
- I never turned
my back on Aidan.

22:02.150 --> 22:03.914
I never gave up.

22:03.950 --> 22:06.590
- You look at Aidan
now like a nuisance.

22:06.620 --> 22:08.657
You wake up every morning

22:08.690 --> 22:11.125
and the first thing
you think is: "Thank God."

22:11.160 --> 22:13.492
- You're wrong.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.591
- You're not
one of us any more.

22:16.630 --> 22:20.191
In 100 years, Aidan won't
remember your name.

22:20.230 --> 22:22.494
You're entirely replaceable.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.755
- Listen, uh...

22:49.800 --> 22:52.167
I had no idea that
Henry would come here.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.736
- That's all right.

22:53.770 --> 22:55.033
He was...

22:55.070 --> 22:56.993
He was unhinged.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.805
And he was
way out of line, but...

23:01.740 --> 23:04.448
I don't know,
maybe he wasn't wrong.

23:07.350 --> 23:10.069
I found somebody for you.

23:11.650 --> 23:14.517
'He's clean. He's a cable
installer from Somerville.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.982
He's a nice guy.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.249
(Exhales loudly)

23:17.290 --> 23:18.451
- Thank you.

23:18.490 --> 23:20.458
- He's got 2 kids,
a boy and a girl.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.729
Little one likes frogs...

23:21.760 --> 23:23.421
You see where
I'm going with this?

23:23.470 --> 23:24.869
- Yeah, I got it.
Totally.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.720
Don't worry,
nothing can go wrong.

23:26.770 --> 23:29.068
Mr. Walsh won't even
remember meeting us.

23:29.100 --> 23:30.704
- Hey, Aidan!

23:34.640 --> 23:36.472
Just don't make me
regret this, OK?

23:36.510 --> 23:39.571
- Hey...
Catch and release.

23:49.390 --> 23:51.222
- Do you--
Do you want something?

23:51.260 --> 23:52.455
I have soda.

23:52.490 --> 23:54.822
I think we have
a nice oolong tea.

23:54.860 --> 23:55.952
(Chuckles)

23:56.000 --> 23:57.399
- I'm good.

23:57.430 --> 23:59.421
- (Nora): Great.

23:59.470 --> 24:01.529
Because there's
something that, uh,

24:01.570 --> 24:03.095
that we have
to tell you.

24:03.140 --> 24:06.110
- Something that we didn't
tell you at the hospital.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.335
- I was afraid of that.

24:07.370 --> 24:09.031
Do I have another STD?
- Mmm, no.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.674
- If it's about the painkillers,
I'll give them back.

24:11.710 --> 24:14.179
I just sell them
to pay for weed.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.369
- Also not it.

24:15.420 --> 24:17.843
- I'm not pregnant.
Am I?

24:17.890 --> 24:20.518
- You're gonna
be a werewolf!

24:21.590 --> 24:24.582
- (Laughing): OK...
I'll be quiet.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.029
- He's serious.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.925
The thing that
attacked you, it uh...

24:29.960 --> 24:31.598
It wasn't a dog.

24:31.630 --> 24:33.029
- It was a werewolf.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.299
Just like the one
that scratched me.

24:37.340 --> 24:40.332
- And what Josh was like
when he scratched me.

24:40.370 --> 24:42.338
And now,

24:42.380 --> 24:43.939
once a month,

24:43.980 --> 24:46.199
you're gonna
become one too.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.617
- (Laughing): OK.

24:50.650 --> 24:52.118
Look, you seem really cool.

24:52.150 --> 24:54.551
But I should really
get back to the home.

24:54.590 --> 24:56.581
- No, Erin, you can't
go back there.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.486
- I made it sound
way worse than it is.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.419
- (Josh): No, you can't go back,

25:00.460 --> 25:04.522
because tomorrow night's
the full moon.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.595
- But we're
gonna be here

25:06.630 --> 25:08.735
so you don't have to
go through it alone.

25:08.770 --> 25:11.501
- Super thoughtful
of you, really, but

25:11.540 --> 25:12.837
I should go.

25:12.870 --> 25:15.805
- Erin, let me just
show you something.

25:18.080 --> 25:21.243
- Oh, God. You naked in a
dungeon is probably exactly--

25:21.280 --> 25:22.975
- Whatever you guys are into--

25:23.020 --> 25:25.318
- No, no, no!
Just wait one second!

25:25.350 --> 25:26.715
Just wait.
Yeah.

25:26.750 --> 25:29.117
(Josh screaming on TV)

25:33.630 --> 25:35.029
- This is
the worst part.

25:35.060 --> 25:37.859
(Josh screaming,
bones crunching)

25:38.670 --> 25:40.764
- Stop it!

25:40.800 --> 25:42.598
Why are you
showing this to me?

25:42.640 --> 25:45.007
- Because...

25:45.040 --> 25:48.499
Even though this will
happen to you once a month,

25:48.540 --> 25:49.803
you survive.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.070
(Josh growling on TV)

25:52.110 --> 25:54.272
It's almost done.

25:56.980 --> 25:59.984
This is the part
where you feel...

26:00.020 --> 26:03.957
- (Josh): ...like dying.
- (Nora): ...amazing.

26:10.060 --> 26:12.620
(Werewolf growling,
thrashing around on TV)

26:14.300 --> 26:16.564
- How long do I have?

26:22.280 --> 26:24.248
(Birds chirping)

26:25.810 --> 26:28.142
- (Trent): OK. You don't
know these people.

26:28.180 --> 26:29.614
Coast is clear.

26:29.650 --> 26:31.049
Right there,
right there.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.388
She's right there.
That's her. That's Candace.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.752
- (Whispering):
Hey! Psst!

26:35.790 --> 26:37.110
That's her.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.457
Max! Max!

26:38.490 --> 26:40.185
Go get her, Max!
- Excuse me.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.221
What is wrong
with you?

26:43.260 --> 26:44.819
She just lost the man

26:44.870 --> 26:46.964
she was gonna spend
the rest of her life with.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.469
You act like that
means nothing. It does.

26:49.500 --> 26:52.208
And I'm not
your errand boy.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.366
- OK.

26:53.410 --> 26:55.879
- Why I have agreed
to help a pushy woman

26:55.910 --> 26:58.800
who's hated by
the family, I'm not sure.

26:58.850 --> 27:02.673
- Because you're not helping me,
you're helping Trent.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.692
- (Henry): Relax.
Forget you saw us.

27:22.740 --> 27:24.936
- Henry!
- Get away from mel!

27:38.350 --> 27:39.613
- (Trent): Deep breathing.

27:39.650 --> 27:41.857
Bring it on
a little slowly, OK?

27:41.890 --> 27:44.154
- Hi...
- Hi...

27:44.190 --> 27:47.228
What was so important
it couldn't wait?

27:48.200 --> 27:52.364
- Um, Trent wanted you to know
how much he loves you.

27:53.370 --> 27:54.895
- I know that.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.339
I was engaged to him.

27:56.370 --> 27:57.860
- Yes.

27:57.910 --> 28:01.369
- Pardon my bluntness,
but who are you?

28:01.410 --> 28:03.378
- I'm an old friend.

28:04.410 --> 28:06.708
Sa--mantha.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.739
- Who I've never heard of,

28:09.780 --> 28:12.511
who Trent's
never mentioned?

28:12.550 --> 28:13.984
- Yeah, um--

28:14.020 --> 28:16.751
- Trent's real friends and
family are out there,

28:16.790 --> 28:18.622
so you'll have to
excuse me.

28:18.660 --> 28:20.219
- No-- You have to
tell her.

28:20.260 --> 28:21.898
- Just-- Trent
cheated on you.

28:21.930 --> 28:24.024
- Whoa, whoa!
Cheated, strong word.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.767
- And you know this how?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.532
- Because he made out
with me the night he died.

28:30.570 --> 28:31.969
(Scoffs)

28:32.010 --> 28:34.604
- You get crazier
by the second.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.233
- You have to believe me.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.170
- Tell her when she's stressed,
she still sucks her thumb.

28:39.210 --> 28:40.974
- You still suck your thumb.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.784
- He told you that?
- Yes.

28:46.820 --> 28:49.380
- While you were
making out?

28:49.420 --> 28:50.922
- No.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.519
Different time.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.590
Look, Trent needs you
to believe me.

28:55.630 --> 28:56.995
He needs...

28:57.030 --> 28:58.794
He needs to just
clear his conscience

28:58.830 --> 29:01.162
so that you can
both move on.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.268
No...

29:04.310 --> 29:05.630
- Oh, man.

29:05.670 --> 29:07.399
Uh, do something.

29:08.510 --> 29:10.672
- Just, a hug seems weird,
considering.

29:10.710 --> 29:12.178
- Just give
her a pat.

29:12.980 --> 29:16.678
- Just, uh, think of
the good times.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.644
- No, it's...
It's not that.

29:19.690 --> 29:21.180
It's...

29:26.560 --> 29:29.450
I had been cheating
on Trent for a year.

29:29.500 --> 29:30.899
- Come again?

29:30.930 --> 29:33.797
- And I have felt
so guilty.

29:33.840 --> 29:39.199
But if he somehow knew we were
wrong for each other too, it...

29:40.610 --> 29:43.079
It makes it better somehow.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.547
Thank you.

29:56.290 --> 29:58.122
- We'll figure out
how to beat this.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.719
It's like
the Amish said,

29:59.760 --> 30:01.728
I was never exposed, so...

30:01.760 --> 30:03.398
(Grunts)

30:03.430 --> 30:04.727
Drink.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.090
- It didn't work on Atlee,

30:06.130 --> 30:07.723
it's not gonna work on me.

30:07.770 --> 30:10.467
It spares no one.

30:10.500 --> 30:14.300
These mean one thing.

30:15.910 --> 30:17.799
It's over.

30:19.180 --> 30:21.979
(Aidan sighs,
Henry coughs)

30:31.660 --> 30:32.889
- No, it's not over.

30:32.930 --> 30:34.557
You will make it
through this.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.125
You're a survivor.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.525
- Stop it! I'm not.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.892
I slipped because I'm weak.

30:39.930 --> 30:41.568
That's the truth.

30:41.600 --> 30:45.833
I walked into that hospital and
thought: "one drink can't hurt."

30:47.270 --> 30:48.908
You missed one hell of a bender.

30:48.940 --> 30:50.339
- So you slipped up!

30:50.380 --> 30:52.849
But it doesn't mean
that that's the end.

30:53.750 --> 30:56.879
- It's been over for
a long time now, Aidan.

30:57.780 --> 30:59.942
You just don't see it.

30:59.990 --> 31:03.085
It's been over since
I came back to you.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.555
- You mind explaining that?

31:07.590 --> 31:09.991
- Suren, Bishop, Rebecca.

31:10.030 --> 31:12.522
They all believed
in you too.

31:12.570 --> 31:13.935
You were so damn sure

31:13.970 --> 31:15.335
you were gonna
change the world

31:15.370 --> 31:17.429
and they all went
along for the ride.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.231
And now, I'm just
like them.

31:21.510 --> 31:25.071
I didn't see
your face for 80 years.

31:27.310 --> 31:29.950
But I'm right
back here like an idiot.

31:29.980 --> 31:32.984
- Listen, we can
make it through this.

31:35.460 --> 31:37.155
- No.

31:39.260 --> 31:42.594
Because everyone
who loves you dies.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.210
(Siren wailing,
horn honking)

31:56.480 --> 31:58.209
(Henry coughing)

32:02.750 --> 32:04.946
- Hey, Henry...
Shhh...

32:04.990 --> 32:07.243
It's OK. It's all right.
- I can't be here.

32:08.090 --> 32:10.252
- Henry, relax.
You're safe here.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.051
- I can't be here.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.057
- You're not thinking straight.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.420
Don't go out there!

32:20.230 --> 32:24.201
- If I'm gonna die,
it's not gonna be in here.

32:25.840 --> 32:30.573
Not like some pathetic human,
waiting for hospice to show up.

32:32.110 --> 32:35.569
Or one of your dogs,
crawling under the porch.

32:37.920 --> 32:42.084
I have a day,
maybe a week.

32:45.430 --> 32:48.252
But I'm not going out like this.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.125
(Door opens and slams shut)

32:56.170 --> 32:57.729
- I got it!

32:57.770 --> 33:00.899
It was that guy who wanted
to share an RV at Burning Man.

33:00.940 --> 33:02.305
That's who it was.

33:02.340 --> 33:04.172
- All right,
I'm not gonna lie,

33:04.210 --> 33:05.644
it was a setback.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.648
But we still have
a door to get you.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.877
So free association:
any other unresolved issues?

33:10.920 --> 33:12.513
Go.

33:12.550 --> 33:14.279
(Laughs)

33:16.690 --> 33:18.784
- Are you kidding me?

33:18.830 --> 33:21.253
Are you kidding me?

33:21.300 --> 33:24.759
You're not human,
you're not a ghost,

33:24.800 --> 33:28.464
but somehow, you managed
to screw up both worlds!

33:28.500 --> 33:30.867
Since you came back
into my life

33:30.900 --> 33:32.629
you lied about who you are

33:32.670 --> 33:35.469
you left out the part
that ended up killing me,

33:35.510 --> 33:39.469
and then you destroyed
the memory of my fiance.

33:39.510 --> 33:41.547
(Sighs)

33:41.580 --> 33:43.309
You know what?

33:43.350 --> 33:47.116
I finally figured out
how you can help me, Sally.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.790
Just never
come near me again!

33:54.730 --> 33:55.993
- (Max): Sally...

33:56.030 --> 33:59.364
- I know. I'm not supposed to
be here. I'm going.

34:00.270 --> 34:02.591
- Uh, wait.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.679
I know this
is gonna sound hokey,

34:11.710 --> 34:14.509
but, uh, these people,

34:14.550 --> 34:19.147
when they're with me,
they're my responsibility,

34:19.190 --> 34:20.987
living or dead.

34:21.020 --> 34:22.510
And the best I can do

34:22.560 --> 34:26.190
is make their worst day
a little less awful.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.551
But you...

34:33.570 --> 34:37.393
That look of joy that was
on his fiance's face

34:37.440 --> 34:39.636
after you talked to her...

34:40.909 --> 34:44.107
Well, I'd--I'd give
anything to have that gift.

34:47.310 --> 34:48.812
- Thanks, Max.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.560
- I still can't
leave you here unattended.

34:54.590 --> 34:56.114
<i>- I know.</i>

35:06.800 --> 35:09.690
(Crickets chirping,
birds calling)

35:10.740 --> 35:14.131
- (Josh): One rump roast
on a rope for you.

35:15.540 --> 35:18.601
- So this really
fools me? It?

35:18.650 --> 35:19.708
- Yeah.

35:19.750 --> 35:22.617
- What's the other stuff?

35:22.650 --> 35:26.587
- (Nora): Josh put together
a little post-turn care package.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.714
- Yeah, uh, so you got
your blanket,

35:28.760 --> 35:33.027
um, water, toothpaste,
I think there's some floss.

35:33.060 --> 35:34.789
It's for the stubborn bits.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.650
There you go.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.668
OK.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.065
- Where's yours?

35:40.100 --> 35:42.933
- Oh. I don't turn any more.

35:42.970 --> 35:44.506
- Why not?

35:44.540 --> 35:47.237
- Well, because I broke my curse
when I bashed in the skull

35:47.270 --> 35:48.931
of the man
who scratched me.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.732
- Dude.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.202
You've got layers.

35:55.380 --> 35:59.487
* Don't tell me the truth

35:59.520 --> 36:02.455
- Whoa! Whoa!
Why do you have that?

36:03.920 --> 36:06.355
- Just--just in case.
- What do you mean?

36:06.390 --> 36:08.085
- Just in case, Nora.

36:08.130 --> 36:09.256
- What are you
planning?

36:09.300 --> 36:11.223
I thought we were
gonna help her.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.897
- I'm not planning
to do anything,

36:12.930 --> 36:15.536
but I'm not going to
leave you alone with her, OK?

36:15.570 --> 36:20.007
You think that girl
is damaged, fragile, abused.

36:20.040 --> 36:22.577
You think she's you.

36:23.940 --> 36:25.169
But what if she's not?

36:25.210 --> 36:26.905
What if she's...

36:28.250 --> 36:29.649
Brynn?

36:32.590 --> 36:34.319
- OK.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.987
OK, keep the gun.
- Yeah.

36:36.020 --> 36:37.510
- Yeah.

36:37.560 --> 36:41.258
* They don't have to know

36:41.300 --> 36:45.726
* We don't have
it all worked out *

36:47.470 --> 36:52.533
* We can just keep walking *

37:03.220 --> 37:04.346
(Breathing heavily)

37:04.390 --> 37:06.586
- Um, my fingers are numb.

37:06.620 --> 37:08.281
I c-can't feel my toes.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.015
- That's the beginning.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.188
It's normal, OK?

37:12.230 --> 37:14.756
Just breathe.

37:16.660 --> 37:20.290
- I can smell--
- Everything.

37:20.330 --> 37:22.162
I know.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.238
It's gonna be OK,
sweetie, OK?

37:27.510 --> 37:29.933
I promise, you're gonna
be OK, Erin.

37:29.980 --> 37:31.971
You have to trust me.

37:32.010 --> 37:33.808
OK?

37:41.220 --> 37:44.258
- I don't want this.
Please don't let this happen.

37:44.290 --> 37:45.451
I can't--

37:45.490 --> 37:47.424
- You'll be OK.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.200
I'll probably change first,
SO just remember:

37:52.230 --> 37:56.269
follow the smells
and stay close.

37:56.300 --> 37:57.836
It'll be over soon.

37:57.870 --> 38:00.305
(Screams)

38:07.780 --> 38:10.317
(Bones crunching)

38:17.220 --> 38:18.722
Josh!

38:26.730 --> 38:28.368
(Snarling)

38:50.160 --> 38:51.628
(Snarling)

38:54.430 --> 38:56.524
(Both growling)

39:18.450 --> 39:20.487
(Panting)

39:22.660 --> 39:24.879
(Siren wailing)

39:30.960 --> 39:35.261
- All I ever wanted was to
live up to your expectations.

39:35.300 --> 39:36.995
- You did.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.860
- No, I didn't.

39:40.740 --> 39:43.869
Because I couldn't.

39:43.910 --> 39:47.073
You tried to teach me
how to be a good man,

39:49.580 --> 39:51.617
but I'm not a man.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.614
I haven't been
for 100 years.

39:57.860 --> 40:01.490
We're monsters to them, Aidan.

40:03.300 --> 40:05.689
It's all we'll ever be.

40:13.210 --> 40:16.532
I'm a vampire, Aidan.

40:18.650 --> 40:21.005
And so are you.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.514
(Coughs)

41:07.260 --> 41:09.490
- Will you look at that!

41:09.530 --> 41:12.500
* The sun is shining

41:14.600 --> 41:17.592
* I can see it clear

41:18.670 --> 41:21.037
* Will you follow me

41:24.280 --> 41:26.874
* The sun is shining

41:28.920 --> 41:32.584
* I can see it clear

41:32.620 --> 41:35.612
* Will you follow me *

41:36.990 --> 41:41.086
- I was wondering
when I'd get my first delivery.

41:41.130 --> 41:43.599
- I don't think
I'm supposed to be here.

41:43.630 --> 41:46.463
- I'm afraid you are,
thanks to that girl.

41:46.500 --> 41:49.800
Though, I gotta say,
she shows a lot more restraint

41:49.840 --> 41:51.729
than I gave her
credit for.

41:51.770 --> 41:54.467
- OK. All right,
so what's this, then?

41:54.510 --> 41:57.138
Am I supposed to spend
eternity in a soup kitchen?

41:57.180 --> 41:58.432
(Laughs)

41:58.480 --> 42:00.244
- No, no, no.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.045
You are not spending
eternity anywhere.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.048
(Screams)

42:14.330 --> 42:15.650
- Ah...
