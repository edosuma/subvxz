WEBVTT

00:58.220 --> 01:01.720
Ah, well, you are really a peach,
you know that?

01:01.810 --> 01:04.640
I mean, taking me
to Whole Foods and the art store.

01:04.730 --> 01:08.310
Don't forget the transcendental
foot place. That was a necessary stop.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.690
Wait till you try out
the neuropathy socks I got you.

01:11.780 --> 01:18.240
Danger ahead: uncontrollable urge
to cha-cha-cha, pain-free, all night.

01:18.950 --> 01:21.830
Can I get you anything?

01:21.910 --> 01:24.540
How about your license?

01:24.620 --> 01:28.840
Oh, God, it's so good to laugh.
I-I've really missed your snappy wit.

01:30.880 --> 01:35.630
Grace, that stare is filled with Phil.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.390
I believe it's called rage.

01:38.470 --> 01:42.640
If it's any consolation,
I've been awful with myself in my diary.

01:43.850 --> 01:46.480
Your bullshit diary
where you write in the air?

01:46.560 --> 01:50.440
I'm just trying to help, Grace.

01:50.520 --> 01:54.070
I'm trying to say I'm sorry.
I'm trying to cheer you up.

01:54.150 --> 01:57.860
You know what would cheer me up?
Other people cheering me up.

01:57.950 --> 02:01.490
All I see is you anymore,
in the house, in the car.

02:01.580 --> 02:04.870
I lie down to close my eyes,
and all I see is your hair.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.160
Well, I can't help
that I have memorable hair.

02:07.250 --> 02:10.669
Well, I miss other hair on other friends

02:10.750 --> 02:12.840
who don't ask me
about my feelings all the time.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.670
I used to have friends.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.180
We'd meet up for a fun lunch
or a fun drink,

02:18.260 --> 02:19.550
and then you know what they'd do?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.470
I'm guessing something fun.

02:21.550 --> 02:27.390
They'd get in their own cars and drive
themselves away back to their own homes.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.350
And where are these
independent drivers now?

02:30.440 --> 02:33.320
We fell out of touch
after the whole Robert mess.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.280
Wait. Wait a minute. What Robert mess?

02:37.360 --> 02:39.320
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.620
I could go out and make new friends.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.700
But I don't know.

02:43.780 --> 02:46.910
Who wants to start to build history
right before we're history?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.540
-Didn't we do that?
-We had special circumstances.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.920
Maybe I should call some of them.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.710
Although, I don't know.
You know, it is a little weird

02:55.800 --> 02:58.380
hanging out with a bunch of couples
when you're not a couple anymore.

02:58.470 --> 03:02.300
-Do you want me to come?
-No. Besides, it's been a year.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.640
Janet will pick up and say,
"Hello, Stranger."

03:04.720 --> 03:06.560
How do you come back from that?

03:07.470 --> 03:08.890
Do you want to talk about it?

03:08.980 --> 03:12.900
No! I want to do something about it.

03:14.770 --> 03:17.440
But, but I want you to know I hear you.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.320
And don't worry about me
getting my license back.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.660
Dear Diary:

03:25.740 --> 03:29.960
Tomorrow I buckle down and hit the books.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.130
Smiley-face. Winky-face.

03:32.210 --> 03:35.750
Heart, heart, prayer hands.

03:37.840 --> 03:38.970
Mm.

04:03.450 --> 04:05.830
"What does this sign mean?"

04:05.910 --> 04:08.290
What the hell?

04:08.370 --> 04:10.830
Wait, that does look familiar.

04:13.370 --> 04:15.290
Oh, that's why.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.500
What do you mean-mean-mean?

04:18.589 --> 04:19.800
I can't wait.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.680
Oh, it's gonna be so much fun
to see everyone again.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.430
How about 12:30?

04:24.510 --> 04:26.850
Terrific. I'll see you tomorrow, Janet.

04:26.930 --> 04:29.560
How great is this?

04:29.640 --> 04:32.850
Is that a cha-cha?
It's those neuropathy socks, isn't it?

04:32.940 --> 04:37.150
I was so nervous to call her,
my hands were shaking when I dialed.

04:37.230 --> 04:39.570
- Oh, it's been so long.
- Ah-ha-ha.

04:39.650 --> 04:41.740
She couldn't have been lovelier.

04:41.820 --> 04:43.900
Oh, that does not sound
like the Janet I know.

04:43.990 --> 04:47.120
-Frankie...
-She breeds Pomeranians.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.990
She has a Pomeranian.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.700
She's coming to lunch tomorrow
with Mary and Arlene.

04:51.790 --> 04:54.460
The whole country club crowd.

04:54.540 --> 04:58.880
Don't start. They were my best friends.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.550
Besides, you don't have to be around
to deal with them anyway.

05:01.630 --> 05:04.590
Great. Do you know this sign means?

05:04.680 --> 05:05.930
No...

05:06.010 --> 05:08.680
I am not being sucked into...
whatever this is.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.770
-I'm studying for my driver's test.
-Really?

05:11.850 --> 05:14.430
It looks more like a Jamaican séance.

05:14.520 --> 05:18.020
Good band name: Jamaican Séance.

05:18.110 --> 05:21.150
Yeah, I'll tell you a better band name:
"I'm Not Driving You Around Anymore

05:21.230 --> 05:22.900
So You Really Should Take This Seriously."

05:22.990 --> 05:25.570
-Oh, yeah, that'll catch on.
-Well, it better.

05:26.530 --> 05:29.120
Your long Frankie nightmare
will be over tomorrow.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.410
You're taking me to the DMV.

05:31.490 --> 05:34.160
That's tomorrow? I have my lunch!

05:34.250 --> 05:36.670
Oh, calm down. It's an early appointment.

05:36.750 --> 05:41.000
You'll be back
in plenty of time, man.

05:41.090 --> 05:45.340
Now serving number A45.

05:45.420 --> 05:48.430
-I'd like to appeal these results.
-Excuse me?

05:48.510 --> 05:50.470
I'd like to speak to someone
who understands

05:50.550 --> 05:52.720
the biased nature of standardized testing.

05:52.810 --> 05:56.850
Or someone who will consider an essay
in lieu of multiple choice.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.150
We don't have that person.

05:59.310 --> 06:02.190
-All right, let me take it again.
-I can't do that.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.360
You flunked three times.
You need to wait a week to retake it.

06:04.440 --> 06:08.610
A week? Oh, look, there's a
very angry woman coming this way.

06:08.700 --> 06:10.910
Don't pay any attention.
Just be cool and just follow my lead.

06:10.990 --> 06:13.080
-Hey, girl.
-How'd you do?

06:13.160 --> 06:15.410
-She flunked.
-Oh, God damn it.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.790
-I thought we had a deal.
-You flunked again? Forty?

06:18.870 --> 06:21.210
You got a 40?
You're going backwards!

06:21.290 --> 06:24.630
Listen, I'm having some people over
to lunch in a half an hour--

06:24.710 --> 06:26.470
-You can go. She's all done.
-Oh.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.180
I have to come back
in a week to retake it.

06:28.260 --> 06:30.680
-What?
-Let's just leave.

06:30.760 --> 06:34.010
No. Uh-uh. Um, hi.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.100
Hi.

06:37.850 --> 06:41.980
I'd like to introduce you to my friend,
President Andrew Jackson?

06:44.610 --> 06:46.860
Ma'am, you know you can go to prison
for trying to bribe me.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.780
And he's dead now. The president is dead.
I hope you're happy.

06:53.410 --> 06:57.160
You know, this is not over between us.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.130
Seven minutes. I've got seven minutes.

07:07.210 --> 07:09.590
-I can do this in seven minutes.
-OK, I'll get outta here.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.760
You're not going anywhere yet.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.970
Well, not like I'm going far,
because I can't.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.560
No, no, no.
You made me late. You need to help.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.430
Go get the crab salad out of the fridge.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.270
-Sir, yes, sir.
-And get the serving spoon.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.190
-The one with the fleur-de-lis.
-Oh, you mean the French swastika?

07:29.070 --> 07:30.200
Oh...

07:31.990 --> 07:34.490
Does this look tasty.

07:34.570 --> 07:36.370
-Don't mess the mound!
-Oh!

07:36.450 --> 07:38.830
But, I'm starving.

07:38.910 --> 07:40.790
I wasn't gonna put my fist in it.

07:40.870 --> 07:42.580
Well, I was, but now I'm not.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.670
You don't need a license
to take your noodles

07:44.750 --> 07:47.170
and your peanut butter sandwich
up to your studio.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.960
Oh, shit! I gotta go.

07:49.050 --> 07:51.840
No, wait, wait, wait.
Say "hi" and then be on your way.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.840
And lose the dick.

07:57.970 --> 08:00.680
Oh, look at you, Janet. Oh...

08:00.770 --> 08:02.310
Mm.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.360
-Oh, and you brought Ann-Margret.
-Ann's dead. This is Jackie O.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.860
Oh. All she needs
is an over-sized pair of sunglasses.

08:08.940 --> 08:11.400
- She's got 'em.
- Oh, Arlene.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.990
Oh, careful. New hip.

08:14.070 --> 08:15.070
Oh.

08:15.160 --> 08:19.450
Mary, I almost forgot
what an infectious laugh you have.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.290
I feel infected already.

08:22.370 --> 08:26.340
Frankie's here. We were hoping to see you.

08:26.420 --> 08:29.460
I never want to disappoint my fans,
however--

08:29.550 --> 08:31.050
One should always leave the audience
wanting more.

08:31.130 --> 08:33.880
Oh, can't you join us for a little lunch?

08:33.970 --> 08:36.100
You know, if the Meals On Wheels people
catch me eating lunch

08:36.179 --> 08:37.640
they'll stop coming by.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.390
Well, come on, stay.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.190
I mean, we're so curious
about how you two are getting on.

08:44.270 --> 08:47.270
And we want to hear
all about your new single lives.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.070
Oh, I don't think you do, Janet.
Sometimes it really sucks the big--

08:51.150 --> 08:53.700
Everybody grab a seat in the dining room
and I'll get us some wine.

08:53.780 --> 08:55.780
Frankie, would you come help?

09:00.120 --> 09:03.540
No, I won't help you.
I'll be eating a sandwich up in my studio.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.170
Why should I be your waitress?

09:05.250 --> 09:08.920
You'll be my bus-girl. Meaning you'll
ride the bus all week if you don't.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.470
Besides, it'll look too weird.
Like you can't stand them or something.

09:12.550 --> 09:14.340
Yeah, I'd hate for them
to get the right idea.

09:14.430 --> 09:18.600
Just put a lid on it.
Don't be too... you-ish.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.720
-Jewish?
-You.

09:20.810 --> 09:24.480
No railing against country clubs,
don't reference your manifesto,

09:24.520 --> 09:27.600
and for God's sakes
don't talk about the BP oil spill

09:27.690 --> 09:29.360
and what it can do to a crab salad.

09:56.380 --> 09:58.140
Any trouble finding the place, Arlene?

09:59.510 --> 10:00.970
No.

10:01.050 --> 10:03.890
-Did I ask you that already?
-Yes.

10:03.970 --> 10:07.100
Oh. I'm sorry. I meant to ask Mary.

10:08.310 --> 10:12.070
Mary? Any trouble finding the place?

10:13.150 --> 10:15.030
We carpooled.

10:15.110 --> 10:17.070
In Janet's car.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.280
Jesus.

10:23.740 --> 10:28.290
Look, can I just say how sorry I am
that I haven't been more in touch?

10:28.370 --> 10:31.750
-I feel terrible about it.
-Oh, water under the bridge.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.460
-Oh, don't give it a second thought.
-We could've done better, too.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.420
No, no, I get it.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.220
It's hard in these situations.
I was a wreck.

10:39.300 --> 10:43.140
Last year after everything that happened
with Robert, I was...

10:44.060 --> 10:46.270
Well,
you find out your husband of 40 years

10:46.350 --> 10:48.310
is having an affair with another man?

10:49.440 --> 10:54.320
You start asking yourself
some very hard questions about

10:54.400 --> 10:57.440
what makes you happy,
about all the lies you tell yourself.

10:57.530 --> 11:01.370
You should hear all the lies I tell myself
about all the lies I tell myself.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.120
Well, that's all behind you.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.330
And everyone should look as good as you
coming off the year you've had.

11:07.410 --> 11:11.000
-Really, how do you do it?
-Have you guys looked at her plate?

11:12.040 --> 11:16.300
I get a lot of help from my two Italian
nutritionists... Martini and Rossi.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.090
Oh, I've missed you guys.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.600
We've missed you.

11:22.680 --> 11:23.760
-Hasn't been the same.
-So much.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.970
-Who's up for more wine?
-Who isn't?

11:26.060 --> 11:28.230
Oh!

11:28.310 --> 11:31.600
Oh, that was...
that was unbelievable.

11:31.690 --> 11:35.070
No, but, Mary, you're thinking
about the time we were in Cancún.

11:35.150 --> 11:38.940
-This was the trip to Puerto Vallarta.
-She always confuses our trips.

11:42.490 --> 11:44.910
And Frankie, the hurricane
wasn't even the best part of it.

11:44.990 --> 11:48.160
The best part was on the beach
the one day the sun came out.

11:48.250 --> 11:52.170
Robert decides to order us all
prickly pear margaritas

11:52.250 --> 11:55.210
- in his "perfect Spanish."
- I remember this.

11:55.290 --> 11:58.050
Anyway, he orders from this guy
on the beach,

11:58.130 --> 12:02.880
five minutes later the guy comes back
with a sock full of cocaine.

12:02.970 --> 12:04.390
Cocaine!

12:04.470 --> 12:07.390
That's a good band name:
Sock Full of Cocaine.

12:07.470 --> 12:10.310
How we're not all in a Mexican prison
I'll never understand.

12:11.850 --> 12:15.610
Oh, Grace, you remember when, uh, Sonny
tried to roll Robert down the lane?

12:15.690 --> 12:18.900
Oh, yes. It's the only time
I ever got kicked out of a bowling alley.

12:18.980 --> 12:21.280
-You bowled? In an alley?
-Uh-huh.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.110
Well, I tried.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.120
-I was always jealous of your form.
-Do y'all still do that?

12:26.200 --> 12:27.280
-Oh, we do.
-Mm-hmm.

12:27.370 --> 12:30.750
Grace, you should
come play with us next Friday.

12:30.830 --> 12:35.210
That's so nice. Oh, I'll have to
dust off my old pink ball.

12:35.290 --> 12:37.460
Oh, no. We don't use balls anymore.

12:41.090 --> 12:44.840
Is this what it's come to? Is this
what sports are now for old people?

12:46.180 --> 12:48.720
Oh, damn it! See, it's all in the timing.

12:48.810 --> 12:52.430
Did your grandson give you any pointers
when you stole his game?

12:52.520 --> 12:55.190
Shh. I grabbed it before he woke up.

12:58.270 --> 12:59.270
- <i>Aw.</i>
- Oh!

12:59.360 --> 13:01.690
Frankie, you're crowding
my follow-through!

13:01.780 --> 13:03.860
-Why are you screaming?
-I'm not screaming,

13:03.950 --> 13:05.820
I'm getting in shape
to have fun with my friends.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.410
Fine, fine.

13:07.490 --> 13:10.410
Whatever you need to do to get back in
with Puss Face and the gang.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.710
Now what is that supposed to mean?

13:12.790 --> 13:15.580
I caught a puss face from Janet
during the lunch.

13:15.670 --> 13:20.000
No, that's Janet's face. We don't
talk about it, but that's her face.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.960
Well, we got extra puss face
when you started talking about Robert.

13:23.050 --> 13:25.300
Well, maybe the puss face was for you.

13:25.380 --> 13:28.640
You think they didn't hear
all your sideline potshots?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.310
I don't know that they heard all of them.

13:30.390 --> 13:34.430
They couldn't have been nicer to you.
You know what this means to me?

13:34.520 --> 13:36.020
Yes, old friends equal fun.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.980
That's right. Do you remember
the last time I had fun?

13:39.940 --> 13:41.110
Heh. Me neither.

13:42.190 --> 13:45.200
All right, all right. They're your
friends. I'll just have to adapt.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.110
But I'm not getting a Pomeranian.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.620
Well, that's good, because
I'm not driving you to the pet store.

13:49.700 --> 13:50.870
Fine.

13:50.950 --> 13:54.040
I will need one last lift
to the DMV on Friday.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.330
Friday is bowling day.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.830
Can't you ask one of your kids
to take you?

13:58.920 --> 14:00.630
I mean, don't they owe it
for all the years

14:00.710 --> 14:03.260
that you drove Bud to his flute lessons

14:03.340 --> 14:07.720
and Coyote... also to his flute lessons?

14:07.800 --> 14:11.180
Sol usually drove them so that
he could go to his flute lesson.

14:11.260 --> 14:14.180
Well, tell Bud and Coyote
they're on chauffeur duty from now on.

14:19.480 --> 14:23.020
Yeah! That's the sugar mama likes!

14:24.400 --> 14:27.200
OK, OK. Let's do another.
But I'm gonna get this one.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.070
OK. All right. Here we go. Ready?

14:29.160 --> 14:31.410
-Mm-hm.
-"With a Class C license

14:31.490 --> 14:33.490
-a person may drive--"
-Yes.

14:33.580 --> 14:36.710
-Can you be more specific?
-A motorcycle.

14:36.790 --> 14:40.040
No, it's a three-axle vehicle

14:40.130 --> 14:42.540
-weighing less than 6,000 pounds.
-How would I know that?

14:42.630 --> 14:44.300
I haven't driven a semi in years.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.470
Well, you had this last night. Remember?

14:46.550 --> 14:50.220
All right. You know, let-let's do
road signs. You want to do road signs?

14:50.300 --> 14:51.470
OK. All right.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.060
Horse? Horse crossing?

14:54.140 --> 14:58.480
No. No. No, the horse is the one
with the horse on it.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.400
-See?
-Damn it.

15:00.480 --> 15:04.230
Hill? Helipad? Hoagies.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.900
Hoagies? Really, Mom?

15:05.980 --> 15:08.570
The street sign is telling you
where to find a large sandwich?

15:08.650 --> 15:11.030
If it's not hoagies,
I've got an idea for an app.

15:12.830 --> 15:15.370
Oh. "Hospital"? Damn it.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.620
You had that 20 minutes ago.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.620
- I did?
- Yeah.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.380
Gobble, gobble, gobble!

15:23.460 --> 15:25.960
That's a turkey, sucker! Whoo!

15:26.050 --> 15:27.420
Three strikes in a row!

15:27.510 --> 15:30.220
How am I supposed to concentrate
with that going on?

15:30.300 --> 15:33.600
It's like living with
an alcoholic Midwestern dad.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.220
When's dinner?

15:35.310 --> 15:37.470
You know, you want to take a little break?

15:37.560 --> 15:39.060
Mmm.

15:39.140 --> 15:42.190
Clear your head out for a little bit.
All right? Here, study these.

15:42.270 --> 15:43.400
I'll be right back.

15:53.700 --> 15:54.830
<i>Aw.</i>

15:54.910 --> 15:58.290
Didn't you grow up playing video games?
Where's my competition?

15:58.370 --> 16:01.410
Going to the other room to do... not this.

16:02.500 --> 16:06.210
You play like an Amish kid.

16:10.550 --> 16:12.930
Hey, we need to talk.

16:13.010 --> 16:15.680
Mom is really having trouble
remembering things.

16:15.760 --> 16:19.310
Whoa. So, what you're saying is,
Mom is... Mom?

16:19.390 --> 16:21.600
No, this is more than typical Mom stuff.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.650
I think she's starting
to have a real problem.

16:23.730 --> 16:25.980
Like maybe she shouldn't be driving.

16:26.060 --> 16:27.900
Well, I mean, we've always thought that.

16:27.980 --> 16:29.030
Remember what she used to say

16:29.110 --> 16:30.860
when she would drive into the hedges?

16:30.940 --> 16:33.610
Shit, fuck. Fuck, shit. Fuck, nuts.

16:35.530 --> 16:38.200
Oh. Are you sure you're not overreacting?

16:38.280 --> 16:41.710
Look, she's already failed the test
three times.

16:41.790 --> 16:43.670
She's studying like it's the bar exam,

16:43.750 --> 16:46.920
but she's not retaining anything.
It's bad.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.800
We should have a talk with her.

16:49.630 --> 16:51.210
It puts a pit in my stomach,
but I hear you.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.720
Yeah, I'm really worried.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.640
What are you worried about?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.510
- I'm just saying...
- Mm-hm.

16:59.600 --> 17:03.600
...that we were studying
and you were doing pretty well, OK?

17:03.690 --> 17:06.690
And then you took the test
and it was like you never studied.

17:06.770 --> 17:08.650
Have you been forgetting
anything else lately?

17:08.730 --> 17:10.980
No, I'm not like what's-her-name
in that movie with that guy.

17:11.069 --> 17:12.240
You know, the redhead?

17:15.030 --> 17:17.369
Maybe it's time
we think of some alternatives.

17:17.450 --> 17:19.990
-To what?
-We just want you to be safe.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.869
-And others to be safe, too.
-Hold on. Wait a minute.

17:23.910 --> 17:28.210
You want me to stop driving.
Are we really having this conversation?

17:28.290 --> 17:29.960
We're bringing it up because we love you.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.710
And it could be a good thing, Mom.
You don't even like driving.

17:32.800 --> 17:36.010
And there's Uber now,
and everyone delivers.

17:36.090 --> 17:38.550
Maybe, maybe we could hire
a nice college student

17:38.640 --> 17:40.640
who's interested in performance art
to drive you around.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.100
-Huh?
-Yeah. Yeah.

17:42.180 --> 17:44.390
And think of the environmental
contribution you'd be making.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.020
Uh-oh. Carbon footprint.

17:47.230 --> 17:50.440
So you want me to hand over my keys
and live the rest of my life as a shut-in.

17:50.520 --> 17:51.730
No. No.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.990
Oh, right, I could take a cab
to Applebee's,

17:54.070 --> 17:56.660
stockpile ketchup packets
like Aunt Dotty!

17:56.740 --> 17:58.490
Why don't you just put me in a home

17:58.570 --> 18:00.870
where they have shuttle buses
to drive you around?

18:00.950 --> 18:02.700
-Mom, nobody's putting you in a home.
-Come on.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.830
No, you're just locking me up
and keeping me in this one.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.880
And you, of all people, would know
what it's like not to have a license.

18:08.960 --> 18:13.460
If I try to ride a bike, I'm one
speed bump away from a-a titanium hip.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.300
-Mom--
-I can't believe what I'm hearing.

18:15.380 --> 18:17.760
-Let's just take a breath.
-Oh, fuck your "take a breath."

18:17.840 --> 18:23.020
Grace is off with her fancy friends. And
you two Judases have sold me up the river.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.560
I think you should go.

18:25.600 --> 18:26.810
-You're kicking us out?
-What?

18:26.890 --> 18:29.770
That's exactly what I'm doing.
Wait, are you hungry?

18:29.860 --> 18:31.150
Let me get you a little something.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.780
But then get the hell out of my house.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.340
Oh, my God.

18:53.340 --> 18:56.050
Oh, I gotta do something about this.

19:00.010 --> 19:02.850
- Where are the guys?
- I kicked 'em out.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.640
After I gave them lasagna.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.270
I thought you wouldn't eat it.

19:07.350 --> 19:09.520
But if you're trying to fill out
that bowling shirt...

19:09.600 --> 19:11.690
Yeah. What are you doing?

19:11.770 --> 19:12.810
I'm whittling.

19:12.900 --> 19:16.480
-Isn't that what old people do?
-Old frontier people.

19:16.570 --> 19:20.030
I can make you a stick with a point.
Would you like that?

19:20.110 --> 19:21.160
No, thanks.

19:22.660 --> 19:25.790
You know,
they-they think I'm losing my memory.

19:25.870 --> 19:29.710
Maybe they're right. I've taken that test
about a million times.

19:29.790 --> 19:31.960
Why can't I pass it?

19:32.040 --> 19:35.250
Maybe Bud and Coyote
are just being overprotective.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.510
Or maybe they think my mind is going.

19:37.590 --> 19:39.880
Well, it could be
wandering the perimeter.

19:39.970 --> 19:44.430
I can't believe this is happening now.
Just when my life is opening up again.

19:44.510 --> 19:48.100
Oh, look, our brains
are getting a little older,

19:48.180 --> 19:50.560
and it takes longer
for things to sink in.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.980
You just have to be a little
more patient with yourself.

19:53.060 --> 19:55.270
And stop doing this.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.530
Did you ever consider
there may be a connection

19:57.610 --> 19:59.570
between your memory problems
and all the pot?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.160
I wasn't high when I took the test.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.160
No, but you were high when you studied.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.800
What do you think? Hmm?

20:21.470 --> 20:23.890
I don't get you, man.

20:23.970 --> 20:26.180
What the hell are you doing?

20:26.260 --> 20:28.930
Aren't Coyote and Bud supposed to
pick you up for your test in ten minutes?

20:29.020 --> 20:32.270
I could not ask them to leave work.

20:32.350 --> 20:34.440
So I'm gonna take my first Uber.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.440
Oh, you mean not counting the time
you jumped out of the car

20:36.520 --> 20:38.820
because you thought
the driver was Roy Orbison?

20:38.900 --> 20:41.490
-Roy Orbison is blind.
-He's not blind, he's dead.

20:41.570 --> 20:43.740
Who wants a dead man driving?

20:43.820 --> 20:47.830
The fact is, this is the day
of looking the beast straight in the eye.

20:47.910 --> 20:51.290
And I'm gonna pass this sucker,
thanks to your sage advice.

20:51.370 --> 20:53.170
I told you to get off the pot.

20:53.250 --> 20:56.420
I know. I listened
and did the exact opposite.

20:56.500 --> 21:00.250
I remembered a class I took at Berkeley
on how we learn.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.420
-You went to Berkeley?
-Half a semester.

21:02.510 --> 21:05.090
I fell in love with a Black Panther.
Anyways,

21:05.180 --> 21:07.600
there's this theory
that the best way to pass a test

21:07.680 --> 21:11.560
is by recreating the exact state
you were in when you studied for it.

21:11.640 --> 21:15.270
-It's called "state-dependent learning."
-Get to the point.

21:15.350 --> 21:17.810
This is how I studied for that first test.

21:17.900 --> 21:21.030
PJs, Rasta beanie and a bong.

21:21.110 --> 21:25.860
But I did not recreate it at the DMV,
so, of course, I was all thrown off.

21:25.950 --> 21:28.200
You're gonna bring a bong to the DMV?

21:28.280 --> 21:31.120
No. That would be ridiculous.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.500
I'm gonna sneak in a little vape.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.140
-Hey, Gracie-Mae!
-Look who's here!

21:49.220 --> 21:51.680
Hi, guys. Hi.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.230
-It's good to see you.
-Oh, it's so good to see you.

21:54.310 --> 21:56.900
-Oh, I'm really happy you're here.
-Thanks.

21:56.980 --> 22:00.070
- How about this for a set-up, huh?
- It's amazing.

22:00.150 --> 22:02.280
But don't you miss
the balls and the blowers?

22:02.360 --> 22:04.030
Grace loves the balls and blowers.

22:04.110 --> 22:05.400
Oh.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.450
So bad. Get your mind out of the gutter.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.490
-She got you.
-How do you deal with these guys?

22:12.580 --> 22:15.250
We try not to.
Let's get you a drink.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.960
I told you I'd be back, man.

22:19.790 --> 22:23.090
Do you live in the Walgreens parking lot?

22:23.170 --> 22:26.720
No, but I know who you're talking about
and that chick is weird.

22:36.770 --> 22:38.900
Oh, we got a ringer!

22:38.980 --> 22:39.980
Ha!

22:40.060 --> 22:44.530
-We are so lucky to have you back.
-Well, it's great to be back.

22:44.610 --> 22:46.990
Somebody has to teach Bob
how to do a high-five.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.120
Even though I am annoyed
at the fit of your shirt

22:50.200 --> 22:51.780
while we're all in circus tents.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.040
So listen. This is big.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.540
We've been talking about this
ever since we saw you.

22:59.620 --> 23:04.420
-Jerry Weisczak left Gloria.
-Oh, no. What happened?

23:04.500 --> 23:09.630
Oh, it depends on who you ask. I mean,
he wasn't happy, she's never been happy.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.140
Hard to tell if it was the depression
or the pills.

23:12.220 --> 23:14.510
I got depressed so I could take pills.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.890
Oh, she must be devastated. Is she OK?

23:16.980 --> 23:19.310
Oh, it was a lot of drama.

23:19.350 --> 23:25.280
I always say if you've got ugliness
going on, don't lay it on everyone else.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.690
Deal with it like you would a face-lift.

23:27.780 --> 23:30.110
You know, get out of town
until you're all healed up,

23:30.200 --> 23:32.200
come back fresh and ready to play.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.870
Well, you get it.

23:33.950 --> 23:37.830
The point of all this
is Jerry is single now.

23:39.250 --> 23:42.210
Wait. What are you-- What?

23:42.290 --> 23:44.040
He's been asking about you.

23:45.040 --> 23:48.170
No. I don't think so.
Gloria's a friend of mine.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.590
- Just think about it.
- He likes you.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.350
-He's done very well.
-Mm-hmm.

24:03.900 --> 24:07.480
Stop sign.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.240
Aha.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.780
Pass on the left.

24:13.870 --> 24:17.700
Four lane intersection.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.960
Eat that, Coyote!

24:26.710 --> 24:29.460
That's a funny name to name a baby.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.890
-Here you go.
-Now, don't get excited.

24:36.970 --> 24:39.720
-OK.
-Look who just walked in.

24:40.810 --> 24:43.560
- Hey! Jerry!
- Hi, Jerry. Come on.

24:43.640 --> 24:46.230
- Hey!
- Come on!

24:46.310 --> 24:48.610
We didn't want to spring it on you,
but then we thought...

24:48.690 --> 24:50.990
-Maybe we should spring it on you.
-You know, I really don't think that--

24:51.070 --> 24:53.410
Say hello. What's the harm?

24:53.490 --> 24:58.450
Don't forget, Jerry lives right around
the corner from us. How fun would that be?

24:58.530 --> 25:01.620
I get what you're trying to do.
I don't really feel comfortable with this.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.500
Oh, but you must be dying living
out there alone at the beach with Frankie.

25:04.580 --> 25:07.380
I swear, at lunch, I thought a bird

25:07.460 --> 25:10.000
was gonna come flying out
of that hair of hers.

25:10.090 --> 25:14.840
Do you remember, she used to protest
outside my mani-pedi place.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.470
Well, she's very pro-union.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.270
Look, I-I know she's a little unusual...

25:22.430 --> 25:24.690
but we've both been put through
the same wringer.

25:24.770 --> 25:26.650
That's what I told Bob.

25:26.730 --> 25:30.280
"They're living together because
who else could understand that situation?"

25:30.360 --> 25:33.780
But you're past all that now.
Honey, she's holding you back.

25:35.030 --> 25:38.070
-Nobody wants to be around her.
-No. Just a second--

25:38.160 --> 25:41.330
Oh, come on, you've been saying
she drives you crazy for years.

25:41.410 --> 25:43.700
Well, she did. And she does.

25:43.790 --> 25:46.670
But this year,
she's also been there for me.

25:46.750 --> 25:48.330
In a very real way.

25:48.420 --> 25:51.460
Well, are you seriously gonna waste
the rest of your life

25:51.550 --> 25:54.420
being roommates with that hippie nutbag?

25:55.430 --> 25:57.010
Were you always this nasty?

25:57.800 --> 26:01.390
I shoot from the hip,
you know that about me.

26:01.470 --> 26:03.850
-You were worse than I was.
-Well, things have changed.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.390
You've changed.

26:07.230 --> 26:10.060
Thank you. That's the nicest thing
you've said all day.

26:10.980 --> 26:13.190
All right, this has gotten
way out of hand.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.780
Grace, it's your turn.

26:14.860 --> 26:17.910
Why don't we just forget
about all this and have fun?

26:17.990 --> 26:21.030
Sure.
Because that's what we do here, right?

26:24.160 --> 26:25.700
Grace, where you going?

26:25.790 --> 26:30.380
You know what?
I think I prefer bowling with real balls.

26:39.470 --> 26:42.010
Hey, what are you doing here?

26:42.100 --> 26:44.680
When the DMV is more fun
than bowling with old friends,

26:44.770 --> 26:47.980
-you know it wasn't the best time.
-You want to talk about it?

26:48.060 --> 26:51.900
I love you for that question,
but no, thanks. Not right now.

26:51.980 --> 26:55.150
I have something that might cheer you up.
Ta-da.

26:55.230 --> 26:58.070
-Ta... da.
-You passed?

26:58.150 --> 26:59.740
Baby, I'm back in business.

26:59.820 --> 27:02.990
-Oh, my God. I am so happy.
-And it's good for five years

27:03.080 --> 27:05.290
so I still have plenty of time
to lose my mind.

27:05.370 --> 27:07.250
Listen, I'll tell you
when you're losing your mind.

27:07.330 --> 27:09.370
And when I tell you,
you'll know it's true.

27:09.460 --> 27:10.920
And I will do the same for you.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.550
No, thank you. Wait a minute.
Why does it say restricted?

27:14.630 --> 27:18.260
Oh, I-I passed the written test,
but my eyes are... meh.

27:18.340 --> 27:20.630
So no nighttime driving, no freeways.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.720
Oh, great, so you have half a license
and I have no friends.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.560
Or, I have more license
than I had yesterday

27:26.640 --> 27:29.270
and you might have a new best friend.

27:29.350 --> 27:30.770
- Stop.
- I mean it.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.770
- So do I.
- Best friends!

27:33.860 --> 27:35.860
Kill me now.

27:35.940 --> 27:37.490
Are you gonna drive?

27:37.570 --> 27:40.320
Do I have a choice?
The sun's going down.
