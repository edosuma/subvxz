08:02.052 --> 08:05.986
(cheering)

08:05.986 --> 08:07.858
YEAH! GO AHEAD!

08:07.858 --> 08:09.820
SO NICE TO
SEE YOU AGAIN, TOO, REALLY.

08:09.820 --> 08:11.522
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

08:11.522 --> 08:13.023
GOTTA MAKE A BIG SHOW
OUT OF EVERYTHING.

08:13.023 --> 08:14.825
THERE'S MY BABY BOY.

08:14.825 --> 08:15.896
HI, MOM.

08:15.896 --> 08:16.997
COME HERE. MWAH.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.629
OOH. YOU LOOK SKINNY.

08:18.629 --> 08:19.630
AH.

08:19.630 --> 08:20.601
YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.772
OKAY, I'M FINE, MOM.

08:21.772 --> 08:23.534
MM-HMM. WHICH ONE IS SHE?

08:23.534 --> 08:24.635
SHE'S A BRUNETTE, RIGHT?

08:24.635 --> 08:25.936
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS TODAY,
OKAY?

08:25.936 --> 08:27.538
OH, MAYBE
THE REAL QUESTION IS,

08:27.538 --> 08:29.079
WHAT KIND OF NAME IS LEXIE?

08:29.079 --> 08:30.541
(elevator bell dings)
I NEVER TOLD YOU HER NAME.

08:30.541 --> 08:31.542
I HAVE MY WAYS.

08:31.542 --> 08:32.783
WHERE IS SHE?

08:32.783 --> 08:34.545
SHE'S NOT HERE.
SHE'S OUT OF TOWN.

08:34.545 --> 08:36.717
I COME INTO TOWN, AND YOU
SMUGGLE HER ACROSS STATE LINES?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.218
ARE YOU ASHAMED OF HER?

08:38.218 --> 08:40.290
DR. AVERY,
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

08:40.290 --> 08:41.792
OH, INTERRUPT, PLEASE.

08:41.792 --> 08:44.194
OH, MARK SLOAN, PLASTICS.
THE MAN WHO DOUBTS.

08:44.194 --> 08:46.627
LISTEN, I'M ALL FOR
STANDING UP FOR THE JOHNSON,

08:46.627 --> 08:47.858
BUT THIS IS A TRANSPLANT,

08:47.858 --> 08:50.530
AND TRANSPLANT PATIENTS
REJECT ORGANS.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.733
NOW I SEE A 28-YEAR-OLD GUY

08:52.733 --> 08:54.605
WHO COULD HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD LIFE

08:54.605 --> 08:55.806
WITH A RECONSTRUCTED ORGAN

08:55.806 --> 08:57.668
THAT MY BOY HERE AND I
COULD MAKE TOMORROW.

08:57.668 --> 08:59.109
EXCUSE ME.

08:59.109 --> 09:00.741
YOU'RE WORKING WITH JACKSON?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.012
I'M MENTORING HIM.
HE DIDN'T MENTION IT?

09:02.012 --> 09:03.714
NO, HE DIDN'T.

09:03.714 --> 09:05.676
GOT A GREAT SET OF HANDS,
THIS KID. YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

09:05.676 --> 09:07.648
WHY DON'T YOU
SCRUB IN WITH ME?

09:07.648 --> 09:09.620
AND YOU CAN TELL ME
ALL THE REASONS WHY.

09:09.620 --> 09:10.621
I'LL BE THERE.

09:10.621 --> 09:13.223
ALL RIGHT.

09:13.223 --> 09:15.656
CAN'T YOU
JUST STAY OUT OF IT?

09:15.656 --> 09:17.658
HE'S YOUR MENTOR.
WHY NOT GET TO KNOW THE MAN?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.660
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T SKIP TOWN.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.831
ALL RIGHT.

09:20.831 --> 09:21.962
(laughs)

09:21.962 --> 09:24.134
NO, I SAID
I'M NOT COMPETING.

09:24.134 --> 09:25.666
COME ON.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.797
IT'S GONNA BE THE MICROSURGERY
OLYMPICS IN THERE.

09:26.797 --> 09:28.238
YOU'RE GONNA KILL IT.

09:28.238 --> 09:29.740
EXACTLY, AND THEN I'M STUCK
IN THE O.R.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.171
WITH MY MOM
FOR 12 HOURS?

09:31.171 --> 09:32.873
FORGET IT.
MAN UP.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.875
THIS IS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.577
THIS KIND OF THING
WILL LOOK GOOD ON YOUR BOARDS.

09:37.577 --> 09:41.311
NOW GET IN THERE
AND MAKE ME PROUD.

09:41.311 --> 09:42.883
(sighs)

09:42.883 --> 09:46.156
(Miss Li's "Hit It" playing)

09:46.156 --> 09:50.220
WHO HAS WORKED WITH THE TISSUE
OF THE PENIS BEFORE?

09:50.220 --> 09:51.692
KEPNER,
KEEP YOUR HAND DOWN.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.693
SHH.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.224
(Catherine)
ITS DELICATE VASCULARITY

09:54.224 --> 09:55.926

SLEEPING WITH A NURSE,

11:53.944 --> 11:55.445
I BELIEVE,
IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

11:55.445 --> 11:57.047
YOU AND I BROKE UP.

11:57.047 --> 11:59.149
YOU BASICALLY TOLD ME
TO WAIT FOR YOU.

11:59.149 --> 12:01.291
WHAT?
I-I DID NO SUCH THING.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.853

12:04.194 --> 12:05.355

YOU COULDN'T HANDLE
A RELATIONSHIP.

12:07.798 --> 12:09.399
IT WASN'T ME.
IT WAS YOU.

12:09.399 --> 12:11.261
OKAY, NOW THAT IS NOT FAIR
AND--

12:11.261 --> 12:14.064

AND YOU'RE THE JUDGE.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.167
ISN'T THERE SOME RULE
AGAINST THAT?

13:17.167 --> 13:18.899
I DON'T PLAY FAVORITES,

13:18.899 --> 13:20.230
NEPOTISM IS FOR THE WEAK.

13:20.230 --> 13:23.233

ALWAYS SAID.

13:23.233 --> 13:24.234
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

13:24.234 --> 13:25.235
I DON'T KNOW.

13:25.235 --> 13:26.236
DOES ANYBODY ELSE KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

13:26.236 --> 13:27.307
I DON'T THINK SO.

CHAD.

13:40.390 --> 13:41.551
WHAT? I'M JUST SAYIN',

13:41.551 --> 13:42.552
MAYBE YOU COULD BE TRADING UP,
YOU KNOW?

13:42.552 --> 13:43.954
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

13:43.954 --> 13:45.495
THE DONOR ORGAN? YES.

13:45.495 --> 13:46.526
HOW'S IT MEASURE UP? IT'S
NOTHING TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT?

13:46.526 --> 13:47.858
CHAD, SHUT UP.

13:47.858 --> 13:49.159
I'M JUST SAYIN',

13:49.159 --> 13:50.861
MY LITTLE BROTHER'S
A GOOD-LOOKIN' KID.

13:50.861 --> 13:51.862
HE'S GONNA NEED--

13:51.862 --> 13:52.903
HE'S GONNA BE HAPPY
WITH IT.

13:52.903 --> 13:54.164
AND IT'S GONNA WORK?

13:54.164 --> 13:55.435
NOT JUST THE PLUMBING,

13:55.435 --> 13:56.967
IT'LL STAND UP
AND REPORT FOR DUTY?

13:56.967 --> 13:58.238
CHAD, I SWEAR TO GOD.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.940
THAT'S THE POINT
OF DOING A TRANSPLANT--

13:59.940 --> 14:03.543
TO HOPEFULLY RESTORE FULL
URINARY AND SEXUAL FUNCTION.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.246
IF YOU'RE WORRIED, THERE'S
ALWAYS PENILE RECONSTRUCTION.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.878
IT'S LESS RISKY.

14:07.878 --> 14:10.550
I SAW THE SIGNS FOR MONTHS
BEFORE I SAW A DOCTOR.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.952
BY THE TIME
I FINALLY SAW SOMEONE,

14:11.952 --> 14:13.223
THEY TELL ME IT'S CANCER,

14:13.223 --> 14:15.125
IT'S TOO FAR GONE,
AND I HAVE TO LOSE IT.

14:15.125 --> 14:17.627
I'M TIRED OF,
EVERY TIME I LOOK DOWN,

14:17.627 --> 14:19.459
BEING REMINDED
OF WHAT A COWARD I AM.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.431
THIS FEELS LIKE A SECOND CHANCE,

14:21.431 --> 14:23.393
AND LIKE SHE SAYS, IF YOU CAN
LEARN SOMETHING FROM ME

14:23.393 --> 14:24.895
THAT MIGHT HELP OUT
THE NEXT GUY,

14:24.895 --> 14:27.537
THEN I CAN FEEL PRETTY GOOD
ABOUT THAT, TOO.

14:29.940 --> 14:32.072
OKAY. (sighs)

14:32.072 --> 14:34.504
SEE YOU IN SURGERY.

14:36.907 --> 14:38.248

TEMP'S 103.

14:38.248 --> 14:39.579
ABDOMEN'S TENDER
AND DISTENDED.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.451
HER FOSTER MOTHER SAID
ZOLA WAS RUNNING A FEVER.

14:41.451 --> 14:43.483
SHE'S BEEN CRYING ALL DAY.
THEY COULDN'T GET HER TO STOP.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.115
HIGH-PITCHED BOWEL SOUNDS.
CALL C.T.

14:45.115 --> 14:47.587
YEAH, AND I'M GONNA PAGE,
UH, GREY AND SHEPHERD.

14:47.587 --> 14:48.588
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.120
WHAT? THE KID'S SICK.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.962
THEIR CUSTODY WAS SUSPENDED.

14:51.962 --> 14:54.594
I KNOW THEY'RE YOUR FRIENDS,
BUT AT THIS MOMENT,

14:54.594 --> 14:56.226
THEY'RE NOTHING MORE
THAN A THIRD PARTY.

14:56.226 --> 14:58.168
IT'S A BREACH
OF CONFIDENTIALITY.
THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.

14:58.168 --> 14:59.669
THEIR CUSTODY
IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.

14:59.669 --> 15:02.372
THE LAST THING ANY OF US NEEDS
IS A BREACH OF PROTOCOL.

15:02.372 --> 15:03.473
IT COULD JEOPARDIZE
THE ADOPTION.

15:03.473 --> 15:04.474
(Zola cries)

15:04.474 --> 15:06.006
OKAY, OKAY,
LITTLE MISS MUNCHKIN.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.277
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
A LITTLE BIT OF A STING,

15:07.277 --> 15:08.638
AND THEN I'M GONNA BE
ALL DONE.

15:08.638 --> 15:10.110

15:10.110 --> 15:12.112
VERY IMPRESSIVE
IN THE SKILLS LAB, MEREDITH.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.443
WHAT ARE YOU SPECIALIZING IN?

15:13.443 --> 15:14.914
OH, UM,

15:14.914 --> 15:17.517
I WAS THINKING ABOUT NEURO,

15:17.517 --> 15:19.449
BUT I'M MAKING A CHANGE.

15:19.449 --> 15:21.191
JACKSON HAD A CHANCE
TO BE ON NEURO,

15:21.191 --> 15:23.693
BUT HE TURNED IT DOWN
TO FOLLOW ME INTO PLASTICS.

15:25.355 --> 15:28.298
YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
TO WORK WITH DEREK SHEPHERD

15:28.298 --> 15:29.599
AND YOU TURNED IT DOWN...

15:29.599 --> 15:32.202
FOR PLASTICS?

15:32.202 --> 15:34.604
JACKSON AVERY, WHO RAISED YOU
WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING?
MOM, LET'S NOT--

15:34.604 --> 15:36.366
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.
I KNOW, HONEY,

15:36.366 --> 15:37.507
BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

15:37.507 --> 15:40.110
THIS IS ABOUT THIS BOY
AND, OH...

15:40.110 --> 15:42.642
AND HERE HE IS,
THE MAN OF THE HOUR.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.274
CHAD, HONEY,

15:44.274 --> 15:45.976
THIS IS AS FAR AS YOU CAN GO.

15:45.976 --> 15:48.148
BUDDY, AS SOON
AS THIS IS OVER,

15:48.148 --> 15:49.279
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU
TO TEST DRIVE THAT THING

15:49.279 --> 15:50.280
IN EVERY STRIP CLUB
ON LONG ISLAND.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.082
OKAY, CHAD, STOP.

15:52.082 --> 15:54.254
FOR THE PAST YEAR, ALL WE'VE
TALKED ABOUT IS THIS.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.226
I MISS TALKING ABOUT
THE KNICKS.

15:56.226 --> 15:58.288
TELL ME THIS IS GONNA WORK
SO I CAN HAVE MY BROTHER BACK.

15:58.288 --> 15:59.389
IT'S GONNA WORK.

15:59.389 --> 16:01.231
I'M GONNA GO HARVEST
THE ORGAN RIGHT NOW.

16:01.231 --> 16:03.733
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE O.R.

16:03.733 --> 16:05.435
WHEN THIS IS OVER,

16:05.435 --> 16:07.537
YOU CAN NEVER MENTION
MY PENIS AGAIN.

16:07.537 --> 16:09.469
PROMISE.

16:14.544 --> 16:16.146
ALL RIGHT.

16:16.146 --> 16:18.148
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

16:18.148 --> 16:22.552
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

16:22.552 --> 16:26.316
(indistinct conversations)

16:26.316 --> 16:27.687
FREAKIN' HELL.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.992
THAT'S A PRETTY NASTY
BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.225
ARE YOU ON YOUR OWN
WITH THAT?

16:35.225 --> 16:36.626
NO. UH, ROBBINS.

16:36.626 --> 16:37.697
GOOD.

16:43.433 --> 16:45.435
(April) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
LETTING ME HELP YOU WITH THIS.

16:45.435 --> 16:48.007
I MEAN, HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET
TO HARVEST A PENIS?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.610
WELL, I THOUGHT IT WOULD
GIVE US A CHANCE TO CATCH UP.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.641
TAKE THIS, DEAR.

16:51.641 --> 16:53.613
OKAY, HERE WE GO...

16:53.613 --> 16:56.616
LIKE MILLIONS OF ANGRY WIVES
HAVE DREAMED OF.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.717
(laughs)

16:57.717 --> 16:59.119
EXCEPT WE'LL START
WITH AN ARTISTIC,

16:59.119 --> 17:01.421
ELLIPTICAL INCISION.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.693
SO HOW'S IT GOING, HONEY?

17:03.693 --> 17:05.655
OH, YOU KNOW,
IT'S FIFTH YEAR,

17:05.655 --> 17:08.098
AND CHIEF RESIDENT IS LIKE
20 JOBS IN ONE,

17:08.098 --> 17:09.629
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
I'VE GOT BOARDS COMING UP

17:09.629 --> 17:11.331
AND SURGERIES TO LOG--

17:11.331 --> 17:12.802
SO MUCH TO GET DONE.

17:12.802 --> 17:16.035
MM. SO WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO
HAVE SEX WITH A MAN?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.738
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
GET THAT DONE?

17:18.738 --> 17:19.769
HMM?

17:19.769 --> 17:21.311
I'M S--

17:21.311 --> 17:22.742
I'M S--I'M SORRY. WHAT?

17:22.742 --> 17:26.676
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW OR CARE
WHY YOU'RE WAITING, DEAR.

17:26.676 --> 17:28.778
BUT UNLESS YOU HAVE
A GOOD REASON, I SAY DO IT.

17:28.778 --> 17:31.151
YOU'RE ALL WOUND UP.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.123
IT'LL GET YOU UNWOUND.

17:33.123 --> 17:35.125
IT'LL MAKE YOU
A BETTER SURGEON.

17:35.125 --> 17:38.458
OH,
THAT'S A NICE DORSAL VEIN.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.790
YEAH. EASY TO GRAFT.

17:40.790 --> 17:43.693
(whispers) IS IT REALLY
THAT OBVIOUS?

17:43.693 --> 17:46.696
YOU KEEP LOOKING AT THIS THING
LIKE IT'S GONNA BITE YOU.

17:46.696 --> 17:48.568
(chuckles) I...

17:48.568 --> 17:50.170
W--

17:50.170 --> 17:54.073
(bovie sizzles)

17:57.707 --> 17:59.409
CATHERINE AVERY.

17:59.409 --> 18:01.611
RICHARD WEBBER. OH!

18:01.611 --> 18:02.812
MWAH.

18:02.812 --> 18:04.554
SHAME ON YOU.

18:04.554 --> 18:06.556
I SEND YOU MY SON
TO EDUCATE,

18:06.556 --> 18:08.858
AND YOU LET HIM WANDER OFF
INTO PLASTICS.

18:08.858 --> 18:10.120
WELL, HE SEEMS HAPPY.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.761
HAPPINESS
IS FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE.

18:11.761 --> 18:14.624
HE'S MY SON.
GREATNESS IS HIS LEGACY.

18:14.624 --> 18:16.626
AT A CERTAIN POINT,
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE

18:16.626 --> 18:18.668
THAT YOU'VE DONE
EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

18:18.668 --> 18:21.771
YOU CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO DO
THINGS THEY DON'T WANT TO DO.

18:21.771 --> 18:23.473
(chuckles) DON'T I KNOW IT.

18:23.473 --> 18:27.106
WHEN WAS IT THAT WE MET
AT THAT CONVENTION IN MIAMI,

18:27.106 --> 18:28.878
AND I JUST FLIRTED
WITH YOU SHAMELESSLY,

18:28.878 --> 18:31.641
AND YOU HAD TO TELL ME
YOU WERE MARRIED?

18:31.641 --> 18:32.712
I REMEMBER.

18:32.712 --> 18:33.783
ARE YOU STILL MARRIED?

18:33.783 --> 18:35.315
'CAUSE AFTER THIS SURGERY
TONIGHT,

18:35.315 --> 18:36.746
I'M GONNA NEED SOME DINNER.

18:36.746 --> 18:37.747
(sighs)

18:37.747 --> 18:39.649
I'M STILL MARRIED.

18:39.649 --> 18:40.650
DAMN IT. (laughs)

18:40.650 --> 18:41.651
(laughs)

18:41.651 --> 18:43.593
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS
NEXT TIME.

18:43.593 --> 18:44.594
YEAH.

18:44.594 --> 18:45.795
YOU KNOW I DON'T GIVE UP.

18:45.795 --> 18:47.657
HAVE A GOOD SURGERY.

18:47.657 --> 18:48.898
THANKS, RICHARD.

18:48.898 --> 18:51.631
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.906
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

18:59.709 --> 19:01.171
WHAT?

19:01.171 --> 19:02.712
I WAS ABOUT TO DO AN ART LINE
WITH MY LEFT HAND.

19:02.712 --> 19:03.843
ZOLA'S GOT
A BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.215
WE HAVE TO OPERATE.

19:05.215 --> 19:06.516
W-WHAT? WHERE'S MER?

19:06.516 --> 19:07.747
SHE CAN'T KNOW.
NEITHER CAN DEREK.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.680
I MEAN, THEY GET INVOLVED,
AND SOCIAL SERVICES FLIPS OUT,

19:10.680 --> 19:12.682
THE ADOPTION'S SHOT.
WELL, IS SHE STABLE?

19:12.682 --> 19:14.284
FOR THE MOMENT.

19:14.284 --> 19:16.556
AND THAT'S THE RIGHT CALL,
RIGHT? WE DON'T TELL 'EM.

19:16.556 --> 19:17.687
YOU JUST TOLD ME
IT WAS.

19:17.687 --> 19:19.259
BUT I'M RIGHT. RIGHT?

19:19.259 --> 19:20.860
IT'LL BLOW THE ADOPTION?
YEAH, WE CAN'T TELL THEM.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.233
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S YOUR DECISION.

19:24.694 --> 19:26.266
HEY, YOU JUST
CALLED ME DOWN HERE

19:26.266 --> 19:28.198
SO I COULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOUR DECISION?

19:28.198 --> 19:29.469
HOW SMALL ARE YOUR BALLS?

19:29.469 --> 19:30.870
MEREDITH DIDN'T TALK TO ME
FOR WEEKS

19:30.870 --> 19:32.842
BECAUSE I SCREWED UP HER LIFE.

19:32.842 --> 19:34.504
THE BALLS ARE PRETTY SMALL
RIGHT NOW.

19:34.504 --> 19:35.705
DR. KAREV.

19:35.705 --> 19:36.876
THE BABY'S SEIZING AGAIN.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.609
PAGE--PAGE ROBBINS!

19:39.609 --> 19:40.910
WE'RE TELLIN' MER!

19:40.910 --> 19:42.712
YOU BET YOUR ASS,
WE ARE.

19:47.957 --> 19:49.219
(Catherine)
ALL RIGHT, MY DEARS.

19:49.219 --> 19:50.290
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GET TO ANASTOMOSING

19:50.290 --> 19:51.621
THESE DEEP DORSAL VESSELS?

19:51.621 --> 19:52.762
SUCTION.

19:52.762 --> 19:55.194
DR. GREY, EASY ON
THE SUCTION, HON.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.226
LIGHTER TOUCH.

19:56.226 --> 19:57.397
LIKE THAT?

19:57.397 --> 19:58.468
THAT'S PERFECT.

19:58.468 --> 19:59.799
HMM. DR. GREY,

19:59.799 --> 20:02.372
SEEMS YOU'VE INHERITED
THE HANDS OF YOUR MOTHER.

20:02.372 --> 20:03.373
THANK YOU.

20:03.373 --> 20:04.874
DID YOUR SISTER LEXIE
INHERIT THE SAME SKILLS?

20:04.874 --> 20:06.205
DR. AVERY.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.677
I'M MY MOTHER'S
ONLY CHILD.

20:07.677 --> 20:09.379
LEXIE AND I
ARE HALF SISTERS.

20:09.379 --> 20:11.841
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE
PICKED THE WRONG GREY.

20:11.841 --> 20:13.212
MA--

20:13.212 --> 20:14.714
LEXIE IS VERY TALENTED.
SHE'S BRILLIANT.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.246
LEXIE'S GREAT--
GREAT SURGEON, GREAT GIRL.

20:16.246 --> 20:17.417
(Cristina) SORRY. EXCUSE ME.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.788
(doctors murmuring indistinctly)
SORRY.

20:18.788 --> 20:20.350
SORRY.
WHAT IS ALL THE BUSTLING,
PLEASE?

20:20.350 --> 20:23.493
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH DR. GREY.

20:23.493 --> 20:25.955
DR. GREY IS BUSY
MAKING HISTORY RIGHT NOW.

20:25.955 --> 20:26.956
SUCTION, PLEASE.

20:26.956 --> 20:28.498
MEREDITH.

20:28.498 --> 20:29.729
(suction gurgling)

20:29.729 --> 20:31.431
MEREDITH.

20:32.632 --> 20:36.436
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

20:38.838 --> 20:40.670
I A--I'M--
I'M SORRY, DR. AVERY.

20:40.670 --> 20:41.811
I'M SORRY.

20:41.811 --> 20:43.543
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.576
ELLIS GREY IS ROLLING
IN HER GRAVE RIGHT NOW.

20:46.576 --> 20:50.019
WHO WANTS TO TAKE
DR. GREY'S PLACE?

20:51.421 --> 20:52.922
(sighs) DR. KEPNER.

20:52.922 --> 20:54.384
YES!

20:54.384 --> 20:57.427
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME!
I HAVE TO SCRUB.

20:57.427 --> 20:59.429
WE'RE JUST DOING
A STANDARD WORKUP TODAY,

20:59.429 --> 21:02.462
AND IF YOUR BLOOD'S CLEAN,
YOU'RE A FREE MAN.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.594
DO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE LABS
OR CAN YOU CALL ME?
OH, WE'LL CALL YOU.

21:04.594 --> 21:06.836
GOOD, BECAUSE I'M MARINATING
THE FISH FOR TONIGHT,

21:06.836 --> 21:08.538
AND IF IT STAYS IN THAT THING
FOR TOO LONG,

21:08.538 --> 21:09.569
IT JUST TURNS INTO MUSH.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.901
WHAT?
YOU DON'T LIKE FISH?

21:11.901 --> 21:13.272
I DO.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.744
YOU DON'T LIKE FISH?

21:14.744 --> 21:15.945
I LIKE FISH.

21:15.945 --> 21:17.607
GOOD. OKAY, WOW.

21:17.607 --> 21:19.048
I PROBABLY
SHOULD'VE CHECKED EARLIER,

21:19.048 --> 21:21.751
BUT I'M NEW TO THIS WHOLE
DINNER PARTY THING, SO...

21:27.757 --> 21:29.389
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

21:29.389 --> 21:31.321
HENRY AND TEDDY ARE HAVING
A DINNER PARTY TONIGHT.

21:31.321 --> 21:32.462
SO I GATHER.

21:32.462 --> 21:33.793
YEAH, AND WE'RE INVITED.

21:33.793 --> 21:34.964
YEAH, I GOT THAT, TOO.

21:34.964 --> 21:36.326
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

21:36.326 --> 21:38.328
I FORGOT TO TELL HIM.
(clears throat)

21:38.328 --> 21:40.700
IT'S A GOOD THING HENRY CAME BY
AND BROUGHT UP THE MARINADE.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.502
THAT'S NOT A VERY
MASCULINE TOPIC--MARINADE.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.503
I SHOULD'VE COOKED BEEF.

21:43.503 --> 21:44.504
ARE YOU FREE?

21:44.504 --> 21:45.905
I AM.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.537
I MEAN, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME.

21:47.537 --> 21:49.509
WOW. BEST INVITE EVER.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.580
I'M S--

21:50.580 --> 21:51.541
OKAY.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.583
THIS IS MY, UM, BAD.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.485
IT COULD BE MY BAD.
I MEAN--
(Eli) YEAH.

21:55.485 --> 21:57.717
YOU BOTH SUCK.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.919
SEE YOU AT DINNER.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.691
(door opens)

22:01.691 --> 22:04.494
DR. AVERY, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BRINGING ME IN.

22:04.494 --> 22:05.455
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

22:05.455 --> 22:07.457
UH-HUH.
RELAX, HONEY, RELAX.

22:07.457 --> 22:09.499
SUCTION, PLEASE.
(suction gurgling)

22:09.499 --> 22:12.331
LIGHTLY. LIGHTLY.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.863
AND THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

22:13.863 --> 22:16.436
COMPLETES THE WORK
ON THIS DORSAL ARTERY.

22:16.436 --> 22:18.868
EVERYBODY, STRETCH,
SHAKE OUT YOUR HANDS,

22:18.868 --> 22:20.940
TAKE A BREATHER.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.042
YOUR TECHNIQUE HAS IMPROVED,
BABY.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.073
THANKS.

22:24.073 --> 22:25.615
(Mark) IT'S EASY TO TEACH

22:25.615 --> 22:27.517
WHEN THERE'S NATURAL ABILITY
TO WORK WITH.

22:27.517 --> 22:28.818
YOUR BOY'S BORN FOR PLASTICS.

22:28.818 --> 22:30.820
THAT MIGHT BE SO,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

22:30.820 --> 22:34.123
YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL
WITH THAT EASY ROAD.

22:34.123 --> 22:36.085
A PERSON CAN GET USED
TO TAKING THE EASY ROAD,

22:36.085 --> 22:38.528
AND NEXT THING THEY KNOW,
THEY FIND THEMSELVES...

22:38.528 --> 22:41.661
THE BOOB-JOB KING OF SEATTLE,

22:41.661 --> 22:42.962
A TUMMY-TUCK TYCOON.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.464
I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.065
MORE IRRIGATION AND SUCTION.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.797
ARE YOU SAYING THERE ISN'T
EASY MONEY

22:47.797 --> 22:49.639
IN PLASTICS, DR. SLOAN?

22:49.639 --> 22:51.641
ARE YOU SAYING THERE'S NO
VALUABLE WORK TO BE DONE THERE?

22:51.641 --> 22:52.672
SHE'S SAYING I DON'T HAVE
THE DISCIPLINE

22:52.672 --> 22:53.843
TO RESIST THE EASY MONEY.

22:53.843 --> 22:55.475
I'M JUST SAYING,
THERE'S A TEMPTATION.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.646
GENTLY, APRIL.

22:56.646 --> 22:58.147
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE IF YOU KNEW
A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME,

22:58.147 --> 22:59.979
YOU'D KNOW THAT I'M
INCREDIBLY DISCIPLINED.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.511
AND I'M NOT
A TUMMY-TUCK TYCOON.

23:01.511 --> 23:02.912
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT,
DR. SLOAN.

23:02.912 --> 23:04.454
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY TR--
DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR ME.

23:04.454 --> 23:05.855
YEAH, WELL,
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO...
SUCTION, APRIL....

23:05.855 --> 23:07.557
'CAUSE YOU'RE WAY OUT OF LINE.
RIGHT NEAR THE DORSAL VEIN.

23:07.557 --> 23:09.388
I CHOSE PLASTICS.
RIGHT HERE?

23:09.388 --> 23:10.590
I PURSUED DR. SLOAN.
THESE ARE MY CHOICES.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.562
I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE
AND LET YOU TRASH THEM

23:12.562 --> 23:13.723
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE SAME
CHOICES YOU WOULD'VE MADE.
BACK OFF.

23:13.723 --> 23:15.625
YOU BACK OFF.
NOT YOU, THE SUCTION. APRIL.

23:15.625 --> 23:16.926
OH, GOD.
THE VEIN IS STUCK.

23:16.926 --> 23:18.468
OH, WHAT--WHAT--WHAT DO I DO?

23:18.468 --> 23:19.729
ALL RIGHT, SHUT OFF
THE SUCTION NOW!

23:19.729 --> 23:21.400
DON'T MOVE. IT'S SHREDDING.
SHE'S MANGLING IT.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.572
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S NOT STOPPING.

23:22.572 --> 23:24.434
OH, OH... OH, NO.

23:24.434 --> 23:26.506
(gurgles)

23:26.506 --> 23:28.638
OH, GOD.

23:28.638 --> 23:30.109
WHAT DID I DO?

23:30.109 --> 23:31.811
YOU DESTROYED
MY DORSAL VEIN.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.615
IS IT HER SHUNT?
IS IT HYDROCEPHALUS?

23:35.615 --> 23:36.846
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

23:36.846 --> 23:38.187
THAT WAS HER C.T. BEFORE,
WASN'T IT?

23:38.187 --> 23:39.689
I'M SORRY.
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

23:39.689 --> 23:40.920
YOU STILL CAN'T.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.421
THE HELL HE CAN'T.
SHE'S MY PATIENT.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.693
OH, THANK GOD. OWEN, I--

23:43.693 --> 23:45.124
LOOK, LOOK, ROBBINS TOLD ME
WHAT IS GOING ON,

23:45.124 --> 23:47.797
AND SHE IS RIGHT.
YOU CAN'T SEE ZOLA.

23:47.797 --> 23:50.129
OWEN, STAY OUT OF IT.
SHE'S PROBABLY TERRIFIED,
AND SOMEONE SHOULD BE WITH HER.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.661
SHE'S SEDATED.
SHE'S NOT ALONE.

23:51.661 --> 23:53.903
I HAVE A HERD OF NURSES
ON A ROTATING SCHEDULE,

23:53.903 --> 23:55.605
HOLDING HER, SINGING HER--
WE'VE GOT THIS.

23:55.605 --> 23:57.837
DID YOU TRY AN N.G. TUBE?
THE BOWELS ARE COMPRESSING
THE V.P. SHUNT,

23:57.837 --> 23:59.609
AND SHE'S HYPOTENSIVE,
SO WE'RE TAKING HER TO THE O.R.

23:59.609 --> 24:01.541
WELL, THEN I'M IN THERE.
SHEPHERD, YOU CAN'T.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.573
I INSERTED THE SHUNT. IT'S PART
OF THE PROBLEM. I SHOULD FIX IT!

24:03.573 --> 24:04.614
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

24:04.614 --> 24:06.075
THE ADOPTION LADY'S
WATCHING HER LIKE A HAWK.

24:06.075 --> 24:07.847
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A REASON
TO DING YOU.
WHERE IS SHE?

24:07.847 --> 24:09.118
I WILL PAGE YOU
THE MINUTE THAT WE'RE DONE.

24:09.118 --> 24:10.520
I'LL HAVE KAREV
GIVE YOU HOURLIES--

24:10.520 --> 24:13.182
KAREV, LOOK AT ME.

24:13.182 --> 24:14.784
WHERE IS SHE?

24:18.658 --> 24:20.490
PRE-OP. 16-08.

24:20.490 --> 24:22.161
THANK YOU.
I'M GOING THERE.
(Owen) NO.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.893
ARE YOU--
SHEPHERD, DON'T.

24:23.893 --> 24:24.934
DEREK.
BACK OFF, HUNT.

24:24.934 --> 24:26.195
DEREK, DON'T DO THIS.

24:26.195 --> 24:27.697
YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE SHUNT...
DEREK. SHEPHERD...

24:27.697 --> 24:29.539
HAD TO HAVE
BEEN MALFUNCTIONING...
YOU ARE MAKING--

24:29.539 --> 24:30.940
FOR HER BOWELS TO HAVE GOTTEN
THIS BAD?!
YOU ARE MAKING A MISTAKE!

24:30.940 --> 24:32.201
THEY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO LOOK FOR.

24:32.201 --> 24:33.743
EXACTLY, BECAUSE SHE
SHOULD'VE BEEN WITH US.

24:33.743 --> 24:35.675
AND SHE'S NOT,
AND THAT'S MY FAULT.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.707
AND I MAY NEVER SLEEP ANOTHER
NIGHT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THAT,

24:37.707 --> 24:40.049
BUT IF THERE'S A PRAYER
OF US GETTING HER BACK,

24:40.049 --> 24:41.811
WE HAVE TO JUST DOT OUR I's
AND CROSS OUR T's,

24:41.811 --> 24:43.613
NOT MESS WITH THE RULES.

24:43.613 --> 24:45.154
ARIZONA IS A GREAT SURGEON.

24:45.154 --> 24:47.617
PLEASE DON'T MAKE IT WORSE.

24:47.617 --> 24:49.519
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN
ON FIXING THIS?

24:49.519 --> 24:50.820
IT'S JUST KINKED.

24:50.820 --> 24:53.022
ONCE I GET IN THERE,
AND I REMOVE THE ADHESIONS

24:53.022 --> 24:55.264
AND I FIX THE OBSTRUCTION,
THE SHUNT WILL BE FINE.

24:55.264 --> 24:56.626
WHAT IF IT'S NOT?

24:56.626 --> 24:58.127
WHAT IF IT'S DISCONNECTED
OR BROKEN?

24:58.127 --> 24:59.769
THEN I CONVERT
TO A V.A. SHUNT.

24:59.769 --> 25:00.900
DEREK, I CAN DO THIS.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.872
LET ME DO THIS.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.106
(exhales)

25:12.542 --> 25:13.583
I JUST LEFT O.R. TWO.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.244
THEY'VE STARTED.

25:15.244 --> 25:17.787
THANKS. (exhales)

25:17.787 --> 25:20.790
(siren wailing)

25:22.652 --> 25:24.654
I KNOW I SHOULD BE
WITH MEREDITH.

25:24.654 --> 25:26.596
I SEE HER PAIN,
BUT I CAN'T.

25:26.596 --> 25:27.957
I CAN BARELY LOOK AT HER.

25:27.957 --> 25:29.258
THIS IS ALL HER FAULT.

25:29.258 --> 25:31.631
EVERY TIME I THINK
I'VE MOVED ON,

25:31.631 --> 25:33.563
I'VE STARTED TO FORGIVE HER,

25:33.563 --> 25:36.135
SOMETHING ELSE COMES UP,
AND I'M RIGHT BACK WHERE I WAS.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.707
YOU KNOW, CRISTINA AND I,

25:37.707 --> 25:39.238
WE JUST...

25:39.238 --> 25:40.740
WE JUST
WENT THROUGH SOMETHING,

25:40.740 --> 25:42.612
AND I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

25:42.612 --> 25:43.613
(inhales and exhales)

25:43.613 --> 25:44.914
IT'S NOT EASY.

25:44.914 --> 25:47.116
YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T
MAKE IT EASY.

25:47.116 --> 25:48.547
(chuckles)

25:48.547 --> 25:50.680
NO.

25:52.882 --> 25:54.053
(keyboard keys clicking)

25:54.053 --> 25:55.554
(machine beeping)

25:55.554 --> 25:56.856
(clicking continues)

25:56.856 --> 25:59.558
DID YOU HEAR THAT
ZOLA CAME TO THE HOSPITAL,

25:59.558 --> 26:01.190
HAD A BOWEL OBSTRUCTION?

26:01.190 --> 26:03.562
YEP.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.564
CAN'T BE EASY
ON MEREDITH.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.667
CAN'T BE EASY AT ALL.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.900
YOU ARENOT

26:10.900 --> 26:13.342
REALLY USING
MEREDITH'S SICK BABY

26:13.342 --> 26:15.945
TO GUILT ME INTO
PUTTING HER ON MY TRIAL.

26:15.945 --> 26:18.207
WELL, IF YOU THINK SHE LACKS
JUDGMENT, THEN HELP HER.

26:18.207 --> 26:20.149
YOU'RE THE MORAL COMPASS
OF THIS HOSPITAL.

26:20.149 --> 26:21.911
MOR-- (blows air)

26:21.911 --> 26:23.182
YOU DON'T E--

26:23.182 --> 26:25.655
I'M THE MORAL COMPASS
OF NOTHING.

26:25.655 --> 26:27.757
I AM USING ONE MAN

26:27.757 --> 26:30.690
LIKE A PLAYTHING

26:30.690 --> 26:32.662
AND HAD ANOTHER ONE
BRIBING A SCHEDULER.

26:32.662 --> 26:34.964
YEAH, I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT--

26:34.964 --> 26:37.266
LIKE APLAYTHING...

26:37.266 --> 26:39.268
OFTEN...

26:39.268 --> 26:41.831
AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY.

26:41.831 --> 26:43.332
(clicks tongue)

26:43.332 --> 26:46.605
M-MAY-MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP.

26:46.605 --> 26:50.339
DID I MENTION THAT
I PROMISED ELLIS GREY...

26:50.339 --> 26:52.381
ON HER DEATHBED

26:52.381 --> 26:55.314
THAT I WOULD TAKE CARE
OF MEREDITH?

26:55.314 --> 26:57.747
I AM STILL NOT PUTTING
THAT GIRL ON MY TRIAL.

27:02.321 --> 27:03.993
I AM SO SORRY, DR. AVERY.

27:03.993 --> 27:06.025
YOU GAVE ME ONE JOB--
SUCTION.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.897
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF A PERSON
RUINS AN ENTIRE SUR--

27:07.897 --> 27:10.730
DR. KEPNER,
STOP TALKING,NOW.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.331
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:12.331 --> 27:13.963
OKAY, NEW GAME PLAN.

27:13.963 --> 27:16.005
WE HARVEST THE SAPHENOUS VEIN
FROM HIS LEG

27:16.005 --> 27:17.937
AND USE IT
AS EXTENSION TUBING.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.840
IF WE USED A DEEP INFERIOR
EPIGASTRIC PERFORATOR FLAP,

27:20.840 --> 27:22.641
WE WOULDN'T NEED
TO CUT INTO HIS LEG.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.913
I'M NOT FAMILIAR
WITH THAT TECHNIQUE.

27:23.913 --> 27:25.414
IT'S BEEN USED RECENTLY

27:25.414 --> 27:26.876
IN GENITAL RECONSTRUCTION
SURGERIES.

27:26.876 --> 27:29.018
I'VE SEEN HIM DO IT.
THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN AMAZING.

27:29.018 --> 27:30.750
MORE NATURAL LOOKING,
AGES BETTER,

27:30.750 --> 27:32.381
THERE'D BE NO VISIBLE SCARING,

27:32.381 --> 27:35.154
LESS POST-OP PAIN,
FEWER POST-OP COMPLICATIONS.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.425
YOU WANT ME TO GO ON?

27:36.425 --> 27:38.127
I'M NOT GONNA RISK
RYAN'S PENILE FUNCTION

27:38.127 --> 27:39.759
BECAUSE I BRUISED YOUR EGO.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.660
I'M NOT TRYING IMPRESS YOU.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.863
LET ME DO THIS,
AND THAT'LL COME NATURALLY.

27:43.863 --> 27:46.365
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:46.365 --> 27:47.867
COME ON, DR. AVERY.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.999
STEP INTO THE FUTURE
WITH ME.

27:49.999 --> 27:52.972
(beeping continues)

27:52.972 --> 27:56.275
(sighs) WELL, IF YOU FEEL
COMFORTABLE DOING IT--

27:56.275 --> 27:58.207
HELL, I FEEL COMFORTABLE
LETTING YOUR KID DO IT.

27:58.207 --> 27:59.749
AVERY, PREP THE ABDOMEN.

27:59.749 --> 28:00.810
I'M ON IT.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.151
(beeping continues)

28:02.151 --> 28:03.813
SO ALEX WAS SUPPOSED
TO CALL BY NOW.

28:03.813 --> 28:05.414
YEAH.
IN, LIKE, TEN MINUTES.

28:05.414 --> 28:07.987
DO YOU THINK IT'S BAD
IF WE CALL HIM?
YEP.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.690
WHAT IF SHE--

28:11.690 --> 28:13.823
SHE'S NOT GONNA DIE.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

28:13.823 --> 28:16.826
(sighs)

28:16.826 --> 28:18.998
ALL RIGHT.

28:18.998 --> 28:22.031
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO
SINGLE-HANDED LEFT-HANDED TIES?

28:22.031 --> 28:23.232
NO.

28:23.232 --> 28:24.774
TRY IT.

28:24.774 --> 28:26.705
(clicks tongue)

28:26.705 --> 28:29.238
(woman speaking indistinctly)

28:29.238 --> 28:31.841
LIKE THAT?

28:31.841 --> 28:33.843
DID YOU JUST DO THAT
ON YOUR FIRST TRY?

28:33.843 --> 28:36.385
YEAH. WELL, YOU ARE HOLDING
YOUR STRING TOO TIGHT--
OH, OH, SHUT UP.

28:36.385 --> 28:38.788
(sighs) GOT A MESSAGE
FROM KAREV.

28:38.788 --> 28:40.319
THEY HAD TO RESECT
A SMALL PART OF THE BOWEL,

28:40.319 --> 28:41.891
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE
LOOKS GOOD SO FAR.

28:41.891 --> 28:43.492
OH, THANK GOD.

28:43.492 --> 28:44.453
YEAH. (exhales)

28:44.453 --> 28:46.796
(inhales deeply)

28:55.835 --> 28:57.006
DID YOU JU--

28:58.167 --> 29:00.840
OH, I HATE YOU PEOPLE.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.242
DON'T TOUCH IT.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.014
(Alex) YOU KNOW,
I REALLY DON'T GET YOU.

29:05.014 --> 29:06.916
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

29:06.916 --> 29:08.317
WHAT IF IT WAS SOFIA?

29:08.317 --> 29:10.119
DO YOU HAVE
ANY PARENTAL RIGHTS?

29:10.119 --> 29:11.821
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HER,

29:11.821 --> 29:13.522
SLOAN AND TORRES
AREN'T AROUND,

29:13.522 --> 29:14.854
YOU GOT SOME PEDS DOC

29:14.854 --> 29:17.026
SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE
A RIGHT TO SEE HER.

29:17.026 --> 29:18.187
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:18.187 --> 29:19.989
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
KAREV.

29:19.989 --> 29:21.490
(beeping continues)

29:21.490 --> 29:22.862
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST SAYIN',
IT SUCKS.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.533
NO, HERE'S WHAT SUCKS--

29:24.533 --> 29:26.836
ZOLA'S GONNA BE FINE
BECAUSE WE'RE AWESOME SURGEONS,

29:26.836 --> 29:28.267
AND IF MEREDITH AND DEREK
DIDN'T KNOW THAT SHE WAS HERE,

29:28.267 --> 29:29.438
ZOLA WOULD STILL BE FINE,

29:29.438 --> 29:30.870
THE ADOPTION WOULDN'T BE
IN JEOPARDY,

29:30.870 --> 29:32.041
AND THEY WOULDN'T BE
IN A ROOM SOMEWHERE

29:32.041 --> 29:34.503
GOING OUT THEIR MINDS
IMAGINING THE WORST.

29:38.107 --> 29:40.509
ALL RIGHT. GOOD ANASTOMOSIS,
DR. AVERY.

29:40.509 --> 29:42.011
PERFECT FLAP.

29:42.011 --> 29:43.512
THANK YOU.

29:43.512 --> 29:45.454
AND MRS. DR. AVERY,

29:45.454 --> 29:47.887
HERE IS
YOUR BRAND-NEW DORSAL VEIN.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.488
IMPRESSIVE, NO?

29:49.488 --> 29:51.060
IF IT ACTUALLY WORKS.

29:51.060 --> 29:52.791
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW
ALL WE'VE GOT IS A SAD

29:52.791 --> 29:55.464
OLD GRAY PENIS
WITH A PIECE OF BELLY IN IT.

29:55.464 --> 29:56.966
DR. KEPNER,
RELEASE THE CLAMP.

29:56.966 --> 29:58.467
UH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
DO IT--

30:08.878 --> 30:10.279

30:10.279 --> 30:12.381

ABOUT YOU.

30:12.381 --> 30:14.083
BUT I'D SAY
THAT'S JUST ABOUT

30:14.083 --> 30:16.415

FORGOT TO INVITE HIM.

31:24.453 --> 31:26.215
WHY DO PEOPLE FORGET
TO INVITE PEOPLE

31:26.215 --> 31:27.917

TO WAIT FOR ME,

31:36.665 --> 31:38.998
AND THEN HE DID,
APPARENTLY,

31:38.998 --> 31:41.200
AND HE BOUGHT LATTES
FOR A MAN NAMED PIERRE.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.672
IS THAT SLANG FOR SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

31:43.672 --> 31:46.235
SEE, I TRY TO PRESERVE

32:09.598 --> 32:11.200
BEFORE IS RUDE.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.661
BEFORE IS DEPRIVING
THE MAN OF A MEAL,

32:12.661 --> 32:14.233
WHICH HE'S NOW EXCITED ABOUT

32:14.233 --> 32:16.235
BECAUSE YOUR HUSBAND COULDN'T
SHUT UP ABOUT THE SAUCE.

32:16.235 --> 32:19.138
I HAVE TO SERVE DINNER
TO A DEAD MAN WALKING?

32:19.138 --> 32:20.669
OH, BUCK UP.
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

32:20.669 --> 32:23.012
I... (sighs)

33:08.017 --> 33:09.758
IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS
FRIGGIN' MORNING, DUDE.

33:09.758 --> 33:11.490
(chuckles)

33:11.490 --> 33:13.322
I WILL SHUT UP.

33:16.765 --> 33:19.528
OKAY. I'M READY.

33:19.528 --> 33:22.531
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:22.531 --> 33:24.733
THERE'S QUITE A BIT
OF SWELLING,

33:24.733 --> 33:26.605
BUT THAT WILL GO DOWN.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.537
AND IT'LL DO EVERYTHING
IT'S SUPPOSED TO.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.411
(exhales)

33:32.411 --> 33:35.414
IT'S GREAT.

33:35.414 --> 33:36.615
THANK YOU.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.217
(exhales)

33:38.217 --> 33:40.619
YOU WANT TO SEE?
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE LAST LOOK.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.221
I'M GOOD, BRO.

33:42.221 --> 33:43.452
I'M HAPPY IF YOU'RE HAPPY.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.598
(Cristina) WELL...

33:49.598 --> 33:51.330
THAT IS GREAT.
(babbling)

33:51.330 --> 33:52.461
CLEAN WOUND.

33:52.461 --> 33:54.063
YOU'LL HAVE A SCAR,
BUT WHO CARES?

33:54.063 --> 33:56.465
IT'LL MAKE YOU LOOK FIERCE.

33:56.465 --> 33:58.167
HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD,
UH, YOU SHOULD GO TO THE PARTY.

33:58.167 --> 33:59.468
OH, I HAVE TO FINISH THIS.

33:59.468 --> 34:01.640
PLUS, I THOUGHT
I'D KEEP YOU COMPANY.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.513
(chuckles) YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
PRACTICING THIS ALL DAY.

34:04.513 --> 34:07.676
AND YOUR PARENTS, THEY CAN DO
SINGLE-HANDED LEFT-HANDED TIES

34:07.676 --> 34:09.047
WITH THEIR EYES CLOSED,

34:09.047 --> 34:10.449
NEVER MIND CLOSING
A TUBE OF CREAM.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.581
YOUR DAD...

34:12.581 --> 34:14.553
IS A ROCK STAR.

34:14.553 --> 34:15.754
HE IS A HOUSEHOLD NAME.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.786
AND YOUR MOM?
SHE'S A NATURAL.

34:17.786 --> 34:19.628
PEOPLE SAY THAT
SHE GOT IT FROM HER MOM.

34:19.628 --> 34:21.260
(laughs)
SO YOU'RE GONNA GET IT, TOO.

34:21.260 --> 34:24.533
YOU'LL WATCH HER RESECT TUMORS
ALL THE TIME,

34:24.533 --> 34:26.795
AND WHEN YOU SLICE OPEN
YOUR FIRST ABDOMEN,

34:26.795 --> 34:28.837
PEOPLE WILL SAY... (gasps)
"OH, MY GOODNESS.

34:28.837 --> 34:30.599
"HOW DID SHE LEARN THAT
SO FAST? HUH?

34:30.599 --> 34:32.501
HOW DID SHE LEARN THAT
SO FAST?"

34:32.501 --> 34:33.742
AND YOU'LL SAY,

34:33.742 --> 34:37.706
"OH, I COME FROM A LONG,
LONG LINE OF SURGEONS."

34:37.706 --> 34:39.508
(babbles)

34:39.508 --> 34:41.310
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M...

34:41.310 --> 34:43.282
(closes laptop)
I'M GONNA HEAD TO THAT PARTY.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.583
OH, OKAY.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.485
MWAH.

34:46.485 --> 34:47.686
(baby-talk voice) OKAY, BYE.
(babbles)

34:47.686 --> 34:50.088
BYE-BYE. BYE-BYE.
BYE-BYE.

34:51.460 --> 34:52.461
HEY.

34:52.461 --> 34:53.462
HEY.

34:53.462 --> 34:56.465
(siren wailing)

35:01.200 --> 35:03.502
(whimpers)

35:03.502 --> 35:05.204
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.476
UH...
I CAN'T DO THIS.

35:07.476 --> 35:09.538
UH, I-I NEED TO SAY

35:09.538 --> 35:10.809
SOMETHING TO YOU,

35:10.809 --> 35:13.312
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M CLEAR,

35:13.312 --> 35:14.583
BECAUSE I

35:14.583 --> 35:17.516
A-APPARENTLY HAVE BEEN UNCLEAR
IN THE PAST.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.188
UM...

35:19.188 --> 35:20.189
YOU'RE ENDING THIS.

35:20.189 --> 35:23.292
WHATEVER THIS IS,
IT'S ENDING.

35:25.594 --> 35:27.125
YES.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.258
YOU'RE PERFECTLY CLEAR.

35:29.258 --> 35:31.260
YOU'RE THE CLEAREST PERSON
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

35:31.260 --> 35:33.702
YOU DO NOT HAVE
A CLARITY PROBLEM.

35:33.702 --> 35:35.704
I-I DON'T?
NO.

35:35.704 --> 35:36.865
NO. YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME

35:36.865 --> 35:39.238
YOU DON'T WANT A RELATIONSHIP
EVERY DAY FOR WEEKS NOW.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.640
AND I'VE BEEN IGNORING YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE...

35:41.640 --> 35:44.713
DIFFERENT THAN ANY WOMAN
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

35:44.713 --> 35:46.275
SO THAT'S MY FAULT.

35:46.275 --> 35:48.377
I SHOULD'VE WALKED AWAY
A LONG TIME AGO.

35:48.377 --> 35:50.179
I CAN BLAME YOU
FOR MANY THINGS,

35:50.179 --> 35:53.582
BUT A LACK OF CLARITY...
IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

35:53.582 --> 35:55.484
(voice breaking) I'M...

35:55.484 --> 35:57.556
I'M SORRY.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.374
ENJOY THE PARTY.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.359
MY SON TELLS ME

36:30.359 --> 36:32.821
THAT I HAVE TROUBLE
ADMITTING WHEN I'M WRONG.

36:32.821 --> 36:35.424
SO THIS WOULD BE THE PLACE
WHERE I SHOULD SAY

36:35.424 --> 36:37.666
THAT WAS AN IMPRESSIVE SAVE.

36:37.666 --> 36:38.967
OF COURSE IT WAS.

36:38.967 --> 36:40.669
HE'S A GOOD KID.

36:40.669 --> 36:42.631
PROBABLY 'CAUSE YOU'VE
GIVEN HIM SUCH A COMPLEX,

36:42.631 --> 36:45.203
BUT FOR WHATEVER
THE REASON,

36:45.203 --> 36:48.206
LET HIM FIND HIS OWN WAY.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.608
HE'LL DO GOOD.

36:49.608 --> 36:50.809
THANK YOU.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.683
OH, AND...

36:54.683 --> 36:57.516
DON'T COUNT OUT LEXIE GREY
TILL YOU MEET HER.

36:57.516 --> 37:00.819
SHE'S SMART,
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL...

37:00.819 --> 37:02.691
SHE'S PERFECT.

37:02.691 --> 37:05.654
A GUY COULDN'T DO
ANY BETTER.

37:05.654 --> 37:08.657

over P.A.)

37:18.567 --> 37:21.510
DR. BAILEY.

37:23.412 --> 37:25.674
DR. WARREN.

37:25.674 --> 37:27.776
UM... LOOK,

37:27.776 --> 37:29.778
Y-YOU'RE GONNA
HEAR ABOUT SOMETHING

37:29.778 --> 37:31.820
BECAUSE EVERYONE AROUND HERE
HEARS ABOUT EVERYTHING.

37:31.820 --> 37:34.623
ELI AND I
HAVE ENDED THINGS--

37:34.623 --> 37:35.754
THE NURSE.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.386
OH.

37:37.386 --> 37:39.428
YOU'RE GONNA THINK THAT IT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOU,

37:39.428 --> 37:41.730
AND FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY,

37:41.730 --> 37:44.633
I WOULD LIKE TO BE
EXTREMELY CLEAR

37:44.633 --> 37:47.836
WHEN I SAY IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU...

37:47.836 --> 37:49.037
AT ALL.

37:49.037 --> 37:51.300
ARE WE CLEAR?

37:53.702 --> 37:54.973
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.645

38:06.315 --> 38:08.317
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

38:08.317 --> 38:10.959

I WANT A PIECE OF PAPER

39:42.981 --> 39:44.953

39:44.953 --> 39:46.555
WE ALWAYS SAY THAT
WE'RE GONNA DO IT,

39:46.555 --> 39:48.517
BUT WE NEVER ACTUALLY DO IT.
THEN LET'S DO IT.

39:48.517 --> 39:50.559

SHE'S MY BABY.

39:50.559 --> 39:52.120

I KNOW.

39:57.796 --> 39:59.498
AND SHE CALLS ME MAMA.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.530
(voice breaking) AND I KNOW THAT
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S BABBLING,

40:01.530 --> 40:03.131
BUT SHE'S--
SHE'S SAYING IT TO ME

40:03.131 --> 40:04.733

TO SPEND ALL NIGHT

40:21.089 --> 40:22.451

IT'S A LEGITIMATE SPECIALTY.

40:22.451 --> 40:24.453
I'M ASKING YOU
TO SHARE YOUR INTERESTS.

40:24.453 --> 40:25.894
OR YOU CAN TELL ME
ABOUT THIS GIRL

40:25.894 --> 40:27.596
YOU SHIPPED OFF
TO ANOTHER TIME ZONE

40:27.596 --> 40:29.458

40:29.458 --> 40:30.859
CAN YOU BLAME ME? HONESTLY?

40:30.859 --> 40:32.761
I MEAN, LOOK HOW YOU WERE

40:32.761 --> 40:33.932
SLOAN CAN TAKE IT.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.904

40:38.436 --> 40:40.038

I DON'T WANT TO START THIS.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.910
I'M GONNA MEDDLE
ONE MORE TIME.

40:41.910 --> 40:43.942
(chuckles) YEAH. SEE,
IF ONLY I COULD BELIEVE THAT,

40:43.942 --> 40:44.943

40:44.943 --> 40:46.945

40:46.945 --> 40:49.518
IF YOU REALLY LIKE HER.

40:49.518 --> 40:50.779

BECAUSE HE TALKS ABOUT HER

40:52.881 --> 40:55.153

40:55.153 --> 40:56.855

41:04.863 --> 41:06.765
(bell on door jingles)

41:06.765 --> 41:08.637
WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS.

AYIEE!

41:09.638 --> 41:10.899
