WEBVTT

00:25.275 --> 00:27.194
Dance your cares away

00:27.277 --> 00:29.363
Worry's for another day

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
Let the music play

00:31.532 --> 00:33.367
Down at Fraggle Rock

00:33.450 --> 00:35.661
Work your cares away

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
Dancing's for another day

00:37.788 --> 00:39.331
Let the Fraggles play

00:39.414 --> 00:40.374
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.291
-Wembley.
-Boober.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.292
Red.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
Junior!

00:47.256 --> 00:48.590
Hello!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.301
My radish.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.388
Dance your cares away

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Worry's for another day

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
Let the music play

00:58.684 --> 01:02.020
Down at Fraggle Rock
Down at Fraggle Rock

01:02.688 --> 01:04.105
Down at Fraggle Rock.

01:08.026 --> 01:11.697
You want peg leg potatoes
with your parrot melt?

01:14.950 --> 01:16.869
Laugh on, Sprocket.

01:16.952 --> 01:19.413
I keep falling asleep in my uniform.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.539
But remember,

01:20.622 --> 01:24.793
waitressing at a pirate-themed restaurant
pays for my tuition and your dog treats.

01:26.003 --> 01:29.006
I can be a pirate waitress now
if it means changing the world later.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.848
"From Uncle Matt to Gobo Fraggle." Again?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.641
I can't, I can't, I can't!

01:39.725 --> 01:40.934
I have a deadline, Sprocket!

01:42.853 --> 01:44.313
All right, sheroes.

01:44.396 --> 01:45.856
I'm on four hours of sleep,

01:45.939 --> 01:49.735
and I have a huge paper due
on the bioremediation of microplastics.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.820
You know, like bacteria.

01:51.904 --> 01:54.281
Little munchy guys
to eat away at the plastic in the ocean.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.909
I shouldn't put it that way in my paper,
but you get the idea.

01:56.992 --> 02:00.204
Anyway, if you can handle yours, so can I.

02:02.706 --> 02:07.211
I don't know if it's talking to you ladies
or the cold, but I have goose bumps.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.086
But it is awfully cold.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.259
Yep. The thermostat is broken.

02:14.343 --> 02:15.427
Perfect!

02:15.511 --> 02:18.805
And the cold air coming from that hole
in the wall isn't helping either.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.858
First Frost!

02:31.193 --> 02:32.653
First Frost!

02:33.153 --> 02:35.155
First Frost!

02:39.368 --> 02:41.411
Hey, Boober, it's the First Frost!

02:41.495 --> 02:43.622
That it is!

02:43.705 --> 02:45.249
Real sock weather.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.960
Mokey, it's First Frost!

02:48.043 --> 02:50.546
I know. Isn't it peaceful?

02:50.629 --> 02:52.339
Look out! Coming through!

02:52.422 --> 02:53.799
First Frost!

02:56.718 --> 02:58.345
I'm okay. Thanks for asking.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.014
Who knew you could slide on ice?

03:02.724 --> 03:04.268
Hey, my clothesline!

03:04.351 --> 03:06.645
Wembley, it's the First Frost!

03:06.728 --> 03:09.022
First Frost! First Frost!

03:09.106 --> 03:10.482
Okay, okay. Breathe, breathe.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.652
Okay, First Frost traditions.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.863
First we're gonna head
to the Storyteller's cave

03:15.946 --> 03:19.741
for the tale of the greatest explorer
in all of Fragglekind,

03:19.825 --> 03:22.536
the reason for the season,
my personal hero…

03:22.619 --> 03:24.580
My personal hero's personal hero!

03:24.663 --> 03:26.456
The one, the only…

03:26.540 --> 03:28.500
Icy Joe!

03:28.584 --> 03:30.335
Hey, hey, ho

03:30.419 --> 03:32.004
We're Fraggles who love Icy Joe

03:33.172 --> 03:35.382
Okay. And then after we hear
the Legend of Icy Joe,

03:35.465 --> 03:37.676
we'll head to the Ice Caves…

03:37.759 --> 03:39.803
…to retrace every step she dared make

03:39.887 --> 03:41.305
before she…

03:42.848 --> 03:45.225
Disappeared forever.

03:45.309 --> 03:48.061
I'm gonna head to the Storyteller's cave.
You get bundled up.

03:48.145 --> 03:52.024
-I'll meet you there!
-Okay. I call sitting next to you!

03:52.107 --> 03:54.943
Sorry, Wembley. I'm already sitting
next to my best friend.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.445
-What?
-Who's you!

03:57.279 --> 03:59.364
First Frost!

04:03.327 --> 04:04.494
-I'm so excited!
-Me too!

04:04.578 --> 04:07.873
Yeah. I can't wait to see her again.
Hear the whole tale.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.750
The Storyteller!

04:09.833 --> 04:12.252
Here she is. Here she is. Hi! Hi! Hi!

04:15.380 --> 04:16.380
Oh, my.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.966
What a nice welcome.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.136
Oh, yeah! Icy Joe! Icy Joe!

04:21.220 --> 04:22.554
Icy Joe! Icy Joe!

04:22.638 --> 04:24.973
Never mind. It's just you two again.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.810
Okay. Legend of Icy Joe.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.147
Where are my reading glasses?

04:33.023 --> 04:34.149
Here they are.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.610
Oh, wait, no.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.779
Now all of you look like radish cobbler.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.323
These must be my eating glasses.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.285
There we go, there we go.

04:45.369 --> 04:49.706
All right. The Legend of Icy Joe.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.375
Where she is--

04:51.458 --> 04:53.126
Nobody knows!

04:53.210 --> 04:55.754
Okay. Okay, can I do my job?

04:55.838 --> 04:57.172
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.590
Rupert!

04:58.674 --> 05:01.218
"Ballad of Icy Joe." Hit it!

05:06.181 --> 05:07.724
One day you'll get there.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.935
Bless you, sweetheart.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.270
Hit it, Rupert.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.648
So let me tell the story

05:14.731 --> 05:16.859
'Bout the toughest Fraggle 'round

05:16.942 --> 05:19.111
She wrestled Poison Cacklers

05:19.194 --> 05:21.738
And then pinned them to the ground

05:21.822 --> 05:23.824
The bravest of explorers

05:23.907 --> 05:25.868
Forging tunnels underground

05:25.951 --> 05:27.953
Always looking for adventure

05:28.036 --> 05:30.956
And that's exactly what she found

05:31.039 --> 05:35.460
Oh, oh, oh
The courageous Icy Joe

05:35.544 --> 05:39.798
We know that she's a hero
'Cause the stories tell us so

05:39.882 --> 05:44.178
Oh, oh, oh
The courageous Icy Joe

05:44.261 --> 05:46.513
Blazing trails for every Fraggle

05:46.597 --> 05:49.016
Now there's nowhere we can't go

05:49.099 --> 05:51.101
She walked miles in a snowstorm

05:51.185 --> 05:53.478
Climbed trees six Gorgs high

05:53.562 --> 05:58.108
Discovered types of creatures
That would make a grown-up cry

05:58.192 --> 06:00.527
But on her last expedition

06:00.611 --> 06:02.821
When fall's First Frost appeared

06:02.905 --> 06:04.823
She just up and vanished

06:04.907 --> 06:07.242
Some might say she disappeared

06:07.326 --> 06:10.454
'Cause no one has seen Icy Joe
In years

06:10.537 --> 06:12.080
-Where'd she go?
-Beats me!

06:12.164 --> 06:16.084
Oh, oh, oh
The courageous Icy Joe

06:16.168 --> 06:20.547
We know that she's a hero
'Cause the stories tell us so

06:20.631 --> 06:23.467
-Sing it!
-Oh, oh, oh

06:23.550 --> 06:25.177
The courageous Icy Joe

06:25.260 --> 06:28.889
So someday if you see her
Let me know

06:28.972 --> 06:30.349
We sure will!

06:31.600 --> 06:33.060
That's how you do it.

06:33.143 --> 06:36.480
Okay, I'll see you next year.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.399
Where are my napping glasses?

06:39.483 --> 06:41.443
There we go. Okay.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.535
You guys are gonna retrace
Icy Joe's steps again?

06:50.702 --> 06:53.497
Why not stay
and play a new kind of rock hockey,

06:53.580 --> 06:57.584
but instead of greaseberry leaves,
we slide on ice?

06:59.044 --> 07:01.296
-Hockey on ice? That'll never work.
-Nope.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.589
Besides, we go every year.

07:02.673 --> 07:03.757
-It's tradition.
-Yeah.

07:03.841 --> 07:07.761
And here's my tradition:
warning you not to go out into the frost.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.555
How could you think that was fun?

07:09.638 --> 07:11.473
Quality time with my friend?

07:11.557 --> 07:12.933
Yes, please.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.185
Two helpings' worth.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.770
I'm a hungry Fraggle.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.815
Well, if you need me,
just send back energy.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.067
My receptors are open.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.821
Or you can just call us
over the Doozer tube

07:25.904 --> 07:27.573
if anything exciting happens.

07:27.656 --> 07:28.949
It won't.

07:29.491 --> 07:32.536
There's a huge ice wall
blocking Icy Joe's actual trek,

07:32.619 --> 07:34.204
so you can't get that close.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.790
Red, that's not the Icy Joe spirit.

07:36.874 --> 07:40.085
Hey, before we go,
let's see what my Uncle Matt sent.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.088
It might inspire! It usually does.

07:43.172 --> 07:46.466
Oh, no, just as my earmuffs go on.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.053
-"Dear Nephew Gobo"--
-What?

07:50.137 --> 07:52.097
-"I have news."
-What?

07:52.181 --> 07:55.642
In my travels,
I have discovered a frosty adventurer

07:55.726 --> 07:57.728
equal to the heroic Icy Joe.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.979
Me.

07:59.062 --> 08:02.149
Wherever I go,
I confront obstacles head-on.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.445
Slide the tray down, deary.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.532
Well, let me show them how it's done.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.911
Coming through!

08:13.994 --> 08:15.787
-Hey!
-I was a hero, admired by all!

08:18.332 --> 08:21.543
-Sure, there were casualties, but…
-Pardon.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.962
…naturally, I survived without a scratch.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.174
And I received a perfect ten.

08:28.133 --> 08:31.803
So on this First Frost,
I give you my heroic artifact,

08:31.887 --> 08:34.306
the Uncle Travelling Matt Traveling Flat.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.644
This belongs in a museum!

08:38.727 --> 08:41.813
-Well, you belong in a museum!
-What? You do, Wembley!

08:41.897 --> 08:43.440
No, you do, Gobo!

08:43.524 --> 08:44.900
We're gonna go on an adventure!

08:44.983 --> 08:46.944
-Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
-Adventure! Adventure!

08:47.027 --> 08:48.779
-Okay, we're off!
-Adventure!

08:50.155 --> 08:52.574
Have fun on your trip to nowhere!

08:52.658 --> 08:53.700
We will!

08:54.743 --> 08:55.994
Come on, Wembley!

09:00.290 --> 09:02.459
Where do you wanna live, little fella?

09:02.543 --> 09:06.004
Maybe right there.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.965
Oh, honey!

09:08.048 --> 09:11.969
Your father asked you to make a fountain,
and you're really doing it.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.264
-It looks Gorg-geous!
-Thanks, Ma.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.517
It looks terrible!

09:18.600 --> 09:20.894
A light wind would blow it over.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.272
Okay. Well, what should I do?

09:23.355 --> 09:26.441
I don't know.
Knock it over and start from scratch.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.611
Okay. I guess you're right, Pa.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.029
Course I'm right!

09:31.113 --> 09:34.032
It's exhausting being right all the time.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.076
-Okay.
-Okay.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.663
Oh, the courageous Icy Joe

09:39.746 --> 09:41.748
Blazing trails for every Fraggle

09:41.832 --> 09:43.584
Now there's nowhere we can't go

09:43.667 --> 09:45.210
-Take it away!
-Oh, oh--

09:45.294 --> 09:47.337
Gobo, wait.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.340
Have we made it this far
into the Ice Cave before?

09:51.550 --> 09:53.260
Hey, Wembley, no, I don't think so.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.429
Well, normally the ice wall blocks us.

09:59.308 --> 10:02.811
All that new water we have in Fraggle Rock
must've melted that entranceway.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.606
Hey, Wembley, in the spirit of Icy Joe,

10:05.689 --> 10:08.233
let's see how far we can go!

10:08.317 --> 10:10.402
Oh, oh, oh
The coura--

10:10.485 --> 10:12.696
The courageous Icy Joe

10:12.779 --> 10:15.532
-Nice vocals, Wembley.
-That wasn't me.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.160
It's me, Icy Joe.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.787
I'm half frozen.

10:21.747 --> 10:24.416
Well, don't just stand there,
you pebblets.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.751
Help me.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.381
Well, I can't feel my elbows
or believe my eyes,

10:31.465 --> 10:33.133
but Icy Joe is alive!

10:33.217 --> 10:35.344
How long has Icy Joe been here?

10:35.427 --> 10:37.888
A couple of weeks? A month or two?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.807
-Well, more like hundreds of years.
-Yeah.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.645
That's-- That's a lot to take in.

10:44.728 --> 10:45.896
Yeah.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.316
Well, I just wanna say
what an honor it is to meet you,

10:49.399 --> 10:52.319
your Joe-ness? Your Iciness?

10:52.402 --> 10:53.820
Ma'am?

10:53.904 --> 10:55.364
I'm Wembley.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.242
And I'm Gobo.
And you are a huge hero of mine.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.953
Oh, well…

11:01.036 --> 11:05.123
It's nice to meet me, Bobo and Vembley.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.417
Actually, it's Gobo and Wembley.

11:07.501 --> 11:08.919
But that's fine.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.254
Well, let's see.

11:11.421 --> 11:14.049
Well, there you go. Yep, you're free.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.385
Okay. Here I go!

11:16.468 --> 11:18.178
Boy, where is it?

11:19.471 --> 11:21.723
Come on, bottom sticks. Get it together.

11:23.767 --> 11:24.768
Where is it?

11:25.936 --> 11:28.355
Just another second
and I'll have it under control.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.574
So, this must've been
a huge moment for you.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.117
It is, yeah.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.202
Well, back to my mission.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.832
-Well, don't you wanna eat first?
-Yeah.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.667
I mean, it has been, you know,

11:48.750 --> 11:49.877
-hundreds of years.
-Yeah.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.504
I'm not hungry at all.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.217
That's just my insides thawing.

11:57.301 --> 11:58.468
Okay.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.847
-But since you're clearly fans…
-Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

12:01.930 --> 12:03.932
I'll give you the honor of feeding me.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.731
Testing, testing.
Wembley one, two, blueberry, five.

12:10.814 --> 12:13.817
Come in, can you hear me?
We found Icy Joe!

12:13.901 --> 12:15.444
She's alive!

12:15.527 --> 12:18.322
What? How is that possible?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.324
I'll explain when we get back.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.409
Just start cooking!

12:22.492 --> 12:23.827
But th--

12:30.542 --> 12:35.130
Icy Joe is alive, and we're going to
prepare her homecoming feast.

12:35.672 --> 12:39.510
I'm thinking a culinary tribute
to the radish.

12:41.053 --> 12:44.389
Purees, soufflés, hoorays!

12:46.225 --> 12:49.561
The last one is because that's
what she'll say when she tastes the food.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.651
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go, go, go, go, go!

12:55.734 --> 12:58.195
Okay. Let's get cooking!

12:58.278 --> 13:01.073
-Icy Joe is alive!
-Yeah!

13:01.740 --> 13:03.492
I totally called it.

13:04.326 --> 13:05.827
Did you?

13:09.831 --> 13:13.585
I can't believe I was frozen
all that time, young Globo.

13:13.669 --> 13:15.212
Tell me.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.215
Is Ruby Fraggle still with us?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.384
Probably not.

13:21.552 --> 13:23.762
All the good ones are gone!

13:25.681 --> 13:27.349
No offense. I mean…

13:27.432 --> 13:28.851
Soft.

13:33.230 --> 13:36.066
-Yeah, totally.
-Hey. How come you didn't wait for me?

13:36.149 --> 13:39.444
Well, if you're gonna walk slow,
don't walk with Icy Joe.

13:41.613 --> 13:42.948
I like that!

13:43.031 --> 13:44.116
Flobo!

13:45.200 --> 13:47.077
-Write that down. Yes.
-Okay.

13:52.624 --> 13:53.625
Gobo?

13:57.754 --> 14:01.133
Would you like scuttle rings
or treasure tots?

14:06.471 --> 14:07.472
I'm up!

14:08.974 --> 14:10.017
Back to my paper.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.270
My landlord's gotta fix my heat.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.521
And I'm starving.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.359
Thanks.

14:19.443 --> 14:22.070
I should eat. You're a lifesaver.

14:24.323 --> 14:26.283
All right, let's do this.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.120
That's not human food.

14:30.204 --> 14:32.247
Yep, that's a dog treat.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.584
Yeah.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.172
-Hey.
-Yes.

14:40.255 --> 14:41.256
Everyone!

14:41.340 --> 14:42.925
There she is!

14:43.008 --> 14:44.134
It's Icy Joe!

14:44.218 --> 14:47.346
Welcome home, Icy Joe!

14:47.429 --> 14:49.765
-We have organized--
-Excuse me. Miss Joe?

14:49.848 --> 14:52.976
I'm Boober Fraggle.
I'm the head chef and maître d'.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.937
Right this way, please, if you would.

14:57.439 --> 15:00.108
So, have you dined with us before?

15:00.192 --> 15:02.444
Of course not.
You've been frozen for so long.

15:06.156 --> 15:10.452
Allow me to take you
on a culinary tour of the radish.

15:11.370 --> 15:12.371
Hey!

15:12.454 --> 15:13.956
When you're hungry, ask for me

15:14.039 --> 15:16.041
Or if you're starved for company

15:16.124 --> 15:19.878
It's nice to visit friends and see
The lights are on inside

15:19.962 --> 15:21.964
If you're sick or if you're well

15:22.047 --> 15:24.007
Or bursting with some news to tell

15:24.091 --> 15:27.761
All you have to do is yell
The door is open wide

15:27.845 --> 15:31.765
You know you are welcome in our home

15:31.849 --> 15:35.644
I, you, me
We're sharing and not alone

15:36.728 --> 15:37.813
Yeah, come on, everybody.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.106
You're not alone.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.733
When you need a silly hat

15:41.817 --> 15:43.652
Or you'd love to have a chat

15:43.735 --> 15:47.781
It's nice to know the welcome mat
Will never be worn through

15:47.865 --> 15:49.658
Sharing's dandy and it's grand

15:49.741 --> 15:51.660
Besides it sure can come in handy

15:51.743 --> 15:55.664
When you know that understanding's
Waiting there for you

15:55.747 --> 15:58.876
You know you are welcome in our home

16:00.294 --> 16:03.338
I, you, me
We're sharing and not alone

16:03.422 --> 16:05.674
Enough!

16:07.551 --> 16:11.346
Icy Joe didn't come here for prancin'!

16:11.430 --> 16:13.515
She came here for the food!

16:13.599 --> 16:15.851
Yeah, she's just hungry.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.436
Wouldn't you be?

16:17.519 --> 16:20.063
Okay, maybe a different approach.

16:22.316 --> 16:24.359
Is it just me, or is she mean?

16:24.443 --> 16:28.197
-Hello, I'm Mokey. And I'm--
-Not interested!

16:28.280 --> 16:29.323
Okay.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.366
Yeah, she's mean.

16:31.450 --> 16:34.119
Miss Joe? Here, try the stew.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.415
There you go.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.375
How's that? What do you think?

16:42.419 --> 16:43.670
Too clean!

16:43.754 --> 16:48.842
In Icy Joe's day, we ate our radishes
straight up, dirt first!

16:48.926 --> 16:52.638
Enough. I'll feed myself!

16:53.138 --> 16:54.723
Prancin' and dancin'--

16:54.806 --> 16:55.933
Oh, dear.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.227
An explorer who knows what she likes.

16:58.310 --> 16:59.853
Isn't she great?

17:00.938 --> 17:02.523
Maybe it's too many shallots.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.736
She's in my bed.

17:07.819 --> 17:11.949
Excuse me?
Just what do you think you're do--

17:13.157 --> 17:14.367
Don't explode.

17:14.451 --> 17:17.371
Keep breathing
through difficult situations.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.164
Right? Yeah? Yeah, watch.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.542
Hello, Icy Joe.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.377
Sunshine to you.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.463
Just a point of clarity.

17:26.547 --> 17:28.757
This is actually our cave,

17:28.841 --> 17:32.094
and that's Red's bed
you're sprinkling with soil.

17:35.097 --> 17:38.141
-Icy Joe was here long before any of you…
-Well--

17:38.225 --> 17:41.311
…so this is my cave.

17:41.395 --> 17:43.438
Thanks for keeping it warm, Dookie.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.443
I'll keep you warm, all right!

17:50.696 --> 17:54.616
Breathe deeply
into difficult situations, remember?

17:54.700 --> 17:57.661
Radical empathy! Radical empathy!

17:57.744 --> 18:00.372
So this is where the party is.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.083
I'm so glad you're all getting along.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.003
There you are.
Time to get back to the trail.

18:06.086 --> 18:09.840
Now, go grab Waffle, and let's hit it!

18:09.923 --> 18:11.466
Waffle?

18:11.550 --> 18:12.885
You mean Wembley?

18:12.968 --> 18:14.928
-You want us to come with you? W--
-Yes.

18:15.012 --> 18:17.306
Well, we'd be honored!
I'll go get him, I--

18:17.389 --> 18:18.307
Wembley?

18:19.057 --> 18:21.643
So, when are you two moving out?

18:23.979 --> 18:26.148
One, two, th--

18:26.231 --> 18:29.234
-No! You gotta wait till I say three.
-Hey, Wembley!

18:29.318 --> 18:32.237
Wembley! Wembley, neat news alert!

18:32.321 --> 18:35.699
Icy Joe is going back out on the trail
for the good of Fragglekind.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.951
-And we are going with. Come on!
-No.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.786
-Gobo!
-Oh, oh, oh

18:39.870 --> 18:41.872
-No.
-We're going with Icy--

18:42.456 --> 18:43.582
What's wrong, Wembley?

18:43.665 --> 18:46.251
All of our dreams are coming true
in the same First Frost.

18:46.335 --> 18:50.214
Gobo, I think-- No, I know…

18:53.592 --> 18:56.094
For someone
who wants to advance Fragglekind,

18:56.178 --> 18:58.388
Icy Joe isn't very kind to Fraggles!

18:59.640 --> 19:01.767
-That took a lot out of me.
-Wha--

19:01.850 --> 19:02.976
No, Wembley.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.103
Well, she's just from a different time,

19:05.187 --> 19:07.356
and great explorers
are often misunderstood.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.400
And besides, she's our hero. Come on.

19:11.235 --> 19:12.361
Your hero!

19:13.320 --> 19:14.321
What?

19:14.404 --> 19:15.948
She's not mine anymore.

19:16.031 --> 19:18.283
Gogo, Wabble, let's go!

19:18.367 --> 19:19.993
Well-- Well, Wembley, I--

19:21.787 --> 19:24.081
I… W--

19:25.082 --> 19:27.960
Don't worry. Just go on without me.

19:41.723 --> 19:45.477
Oh, boy, that Wembley's
really missing out.

19:45.561 --> 19:47.688
So, what are we gonna explore first?

19:47.771 --> 19:50.816
The Icy Ridge or the Icy Roundabout?

19:53.443 --> 19:56.196
Yeah, yeah. Silence, yep!
I'm learning a lot from you today.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.739
You're right. Silence is better.

19:57.823 --> 19:59.324
We're here.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.160
Gathering valuable treasure?

20:02.244 --> 20:04.329
That's not why Fraggles explore.

20:05.831 --> 20:06.915
Up you go!

20:06.999 --> 20:08.500
-What are you doing?
-Higher!

20:10.294 --> 20:13.463
I need you to grab that crystal
for my collection.

20:13.547 --> 20:16.175
I almost got it before, but I slipped,

20:16.258 --> 20:18.886
causing that avalanche that froze me.

20:18.969 --> 20:22.347
This time I'm not leaving without it.

20:22.431 --> 20:25.809
-I need it.
-Wait a minute.

20:25.893 --> 20:28.187
You're only in this for yourself?

20:28.937 --> 20:30.814
I can't do this anymore.

20:30.898 --> 20:32.774
You're not in this for Fragglekind.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.985
In fact, you're not kind.

20:35.694 --> 20:41.617
Fine! If you won't help Icy Joe,
Icy Joe will help Icy Joe.

20:42.201 --> 20:43.243
Move.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.872
Hey, what are you doing?

20:46.955 --> 20:48.248
Be careful! No!

20:48.332 --> 20:51.210
-If I could just get a grip…
-It's not worth it! No!

20:54.379 --> 20:55.631
Oh, no!

20:59.259 --> 21:02.513
Help! Help!

21:05.974 --> 21:07.559
I should've listened to Wembley.

21:08.602 --> 21:12.773
I wanted you to be a hero so badly,
I couldn't see who you really are.

21:12.856 --> 21:17.361
Well, I guess I've never been
anyone's favorite cup of Joe.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.696
-You know, Fofo--
-Gobo.

21:19.780 --> 21:20.948
-Gogo.
-Gobo.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.158
-You know, Momo--
-Gobo.

21:23.242 --> 21:24.117
-Dodo?
-Gobo.

21:24.201 --> 21:25.869
-Yo-yo?
-Close enough.

21:26.578 --> 21:33.001
I got my name not for the ice I explored
but for the ice in here.

21:33.669 --> 21:35.379
Fraggles like me now,

21:35.462 --> 21:37.798
but in my own time, no one did.

21:39.007 --> 21:44.304
You know, you're the closest thing
I've ever had to a friend.

21:47.975 --> 21:51.478
Well, the ice above will soon fall.

21:51.562 --> 21:54.273
Same thing all over again.

21:55.482 --> 22:00.612
Well, this time it's not the same thing
because you're not alone.

22:03.532 --> 22:09.788
Icy Joe's heart just got
a little less cold, Gobo.

22:14.334 --> 22:14.877
Wembley?

22:17.462 --> 22:20.007
How do you stop this thing?

22:25.053 --> 22:27.598
Wembley, how did you-- When did you--

22:28.765 --> 22:30.225
Well, I was worried about you,

22:30.309 --> 22:32.686
so I slipped the Doozer tube
into your backpack.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.897
What? Wembley.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.524
You know, I don't know
if I believe in heroes anymore,

22:37.608 --> 22:40.569
but if there is such a thing,
then you are mine.

22:41.445 --> 22:43.655
The feeling's mutual, captain.

22:44.740 --> 22:46.658
Captain? That's awesome!

22:46.742 --> 22:48.577
-No, you're captain!
-No, you're captain.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.913
-No, you're captain!
-You're captain!

22:50.996 --> 22:53.498
Enough loveyfest!

22:53.582 --> 22:55.667
Icy Joe has words to say.

22:55.751 --> 22:58.003
I'm… amazing!

22:58.086 --> 23:03.425
No, no, no, no. I'm thankful
that you saved my life, Wilfred.

23:03.509 --> 23:05.344
It's Wembley, but that's a good start.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.512
Let's get outta here!

23:06.595 --> 23:07.971
Come on! Hurry up!

23:13.060 --> 23:14.520
Pa's right.

23:14.603 --> 23:15.938
This fountain's spaghettic.

23:16.939 --> 23:18.065
I'm gonna knock it down.

23:18.148 --> 23:20.859
It's so flimsy, it'll be easy, yeah.

23:20.943 --> 23:22.653
On a count of three.

23:22.736 --> 23:26.031
One, four, lily pad, get set.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.369
Well, I'll be!

23:30.452 --> 23:33.747
Why, that's a sturdy fountain, son.
Good job.

23:33.830 --> 23:39.211
Everybody, my son's a fountain genius!

23:39.294 --> 23:40.587
Our son.

23:41.171 --> 23:42.965
-Thanks, Ma.
-He sure is.

23:43.048 --> 23:46.051
-I hope she likes it.
-She's gonna like it this time, I bet.

23:49.930 --> 23:51.807
-You know what?
-What?

23:51.890 --> 23:54.268
It's-- It's growing on me.

23:54.351 --> 23:56.144
-That's hopeful.
-Yeah, yeah.

23:56.228 --> 23:58.730
Icy Joe likes it.

23:58.814 --> 24:02.192
Boo-- Boober.

24:02.276 --> 24:04.444
-Boober, that's me! Yeah. Me!
-Yes.

24:06.113 --> 24:08.615
Icy Joe was kind.

24:08.699 --> 24:11.660
Personal growth is so exhausting.

24:12.244 --> 24:16.415
And as the First Frost ends,
progress is made.

24:19.001 --> 24:21.086
-Sort of!
-Let me help.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.009
The landlord fixed the heater.

24:27.092 --> 24:28.886
And perfect timing as I…

24:28.969 --> 24:33.390
Follow the finger, follow the finger,
follow the finger and boom!

24:33.473 --> 24:36.185
We did it, Sprocket! My paper is in.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.396
Today seemed impossible, ladies,

24:39.479 --> 24:43.275
