00:00.027 --> 00:01.200
<i>Previously on "The Family"...</i>

00:01.200 --> 00:04.960
- I did not get my son back.
- Claire...

00:05.153 --> 00:07.173
I'm sorry I'm not him.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.163
You don't have to call me Claire.

00:09.163 --> 00:11.093
Young man: How's your boyfriend?

00:12.223 --> 00:13.969
People disappoint.

00:14.729 --> 00:16.253
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

00:16.253 --> 00:17.908
The debate.

00:17.908 --> 00:19.073
I feel like I owe you.

00:24.243 --> 00:26.243
Hank: I'd like to speak
with Detective Meyer.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.804
Jane: I am so sorry.

00:28.804 --> 00:30.163
We're gonna bring him home.

00:30.163 --> 00:31.173
How could you?

00:31.173 --> 00:33.133
Jane, what did you do?

00:34.213 --> 00:35.243
Doug: Time to have a talk.

00:36.916 --> 00:38.213
How did he die?

00:38.213 --> 00:39.213
Which is it?

00:39.213 --> 00:42.143
Did he hit his head or did he get sick?

00:46.183 --> 00:48.203
Principal Egan:
Adam was more than a student.

00:48.203 --> 00:51.083
His smile and kindness
touched each of us

00:51.083 --> 00:52.273
at Somerset Elementary.

00:52.713 --> 00:54.143
And as this tree grows,

00:54.143 --> 00:56.223
may his spirit continue to grow with us.

00:58.283 --> 00:59.792
Thank you, Principal Egan.

01:03.273 --> 01:04.702
[Clears throat]

01:06.176 --> 01:08.402
I'd like to use this tree dedication

01:08.402 --> 01:10.229
to honor Adam's love of learning.

01:13.253 --> 01:14.503
Thank you.

01:18.273 --> 01:19.712
[Clears throat]

01:20.213 --> 01:22.665
My, um...

01:22.665 --> 01:24.394
my son would be honored.

01:30.157 --> 01:34.347
I hope other students
are inspired by Adam's example

01:34.347 --> 01:36.387
to put down roots of their own

01:36.387 --> 01:39.073
in pursuit of whatever
makes them passionate.

01:42.257 --> 01:43.338
[Sighs]

01:44.521 --> 01:45.614
Um...

01:45.639 --> 01:48.492
this tree would mean a buttload
to my brother.

01:51.816 --> 01:54.529
Oh, he just...
Adam loved himself a tree.

01:54.926 --> 01:56.849
Oaks, maple, pine, palm,

01:56.849 --> 01:58.269
the little one from "Karate Kid."

01:58.269 --> 02:00.360
Pretty much anything that had,
like, leaves and branches on it.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.876
- Danny.
- Sycamores... not so much.

02:02.876 --> 02:04.047
No, sycamores, he liked to piss on.

02:04.047 --> 02:05.906
- Stop it.
- You know, next time,

02:05.906 --> 02:06.842
we should just do
a shopping-cart memorial,

02:06.867 --> 02:08.281
'cause he did love those,

02:08.646 --> 02:10.727
and it would be just as
pointless as all of this.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.137
Thanks.

02:37.753 --> 02:38.923
How old are you?

02:39.817 --> 02:40.943
19.

02:43.113 --> 02:45.080
Adam would've been 19 in May.

02:46.549 --> 02:47.374
I'm older.

02:51.142 --> 02:53.506
Danny broke my nose once.

02:53.939 --> 02:55.326
[Chuckles] We were kids.

02:55.326 --> 02:58.052
It was on a road trip
to the Grand Canyon...

02:58.332 --> 03:00.165
day 4 in the minivan.

03:01.299 --> 03:04.359
We just couldn't handle being
cooped up together that long.

03:04.653 --> 03:05.924
Made us animals.

03:07.279 --> 03:09.279
Adam and I weren't like that.

03:09.279 --> 03:10.430
You never fought down there?

03:10.982 --> 03:11.796
No.

03:12.259 --> 03:13.222
Ever?

03:14.558 --> 03:16.812
Is there something
that you need to ask me, Willa?

03:19.369 --> 03:20.222
No.

03:21.239 --> 03:22.122
Are you sure?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.542
Are we moving?

03:26.542 --> 03:30.091
The governor's mansion is
very beautiful and historic.

03:30.290 --> 03:31.071
Ugh.

03:31.218 --> 03:34.285
And we can hire people
just to bring us snacks.

03:34.285 --> 03:35.415
I'm stoked.

03:35.415 --> 03:37.707
Claire: Let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

03:37.969 --> 03:40.004
I haven't been elected yet.

03:40.048 --> 03:43.968
Well, if you would like
a free ride to therapy,

03:43.968 --> 03:45.988
the free car service is leaving.

03:45.988 --> 03:48.128
Oh. Don't forget about dinner tonight.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.458
What's your favorite?

03:50.008 --> 03:51.128
Ben: Chinese food.

03:51.128 --> 03:52.531
What are we celebrating?

03:52.718 --> 03:55.091
The two-month anniversary
of your brother coming home.

03:55.183 --> 03:56.124
Oh!

03:56.431 --> 03:58.358
Well, then, it's <i>my</i> anniversary, too,

03:58.358 --> 04:00.398
because <i>I</i> came home when <i>he</i> came home.

04:00.398 --> 04:01.428
It's a little different.

04:01.428 --> 04:03.308
No, it's not. Nope.

04:03.308 --> 04:06.218
And I think I would like
Mexican food, please.

- Just saying. Come on.

[Chuckles lightly, sighs]

04:15.909 --> 04:17.418
You guys seem good.

04:17.947 --> 04:18.947
What?

04:20.228 --> 04:21.408
You and Ben.

04:22.150 --> 04:23.408
It's not <i>his</i> fault.

04:23.408 --> 04:24.760
I'm gonna make it work.

04:25.687 --> 04:27.347
But I need to know
what I'm getting into...

04:27.747 --> 04:28.860
no loose ends.

04:29.540 --> 04:30.620
What do you mean?

04:31.298 --> 04:33.545
I'm sure that DNA test
didn't come cheap,

04:33.939 --> 04:35.380
and if I <i>am</i> gonna win this thing,

04:35.847 --> 04:38.827
I need to know exactly
what we'll owe them after I do.

04:38.827 --> 04:39.661
Mom.

04:39.874 --> 04:43.207

05:01.231 --> 05:02.291
7:00 A.M.

05:02.766 --> 05:04.020
Then he's correct.

05:04.664 --> 05:06.286
Detective Meyer's out on an urgent call.

05:06.311 --> 05:07.914
It may be hours still.

05:08.903 --> 05:09.920
I'll wait.

05:11.271 --> 05:12.798
You sure it's not anything
<i>I</i> could help with?

05:13.321 --> 05:14.285
Has to be her.

05:14.760 --> 05:15.790
And why's that?

05:18.423 --> 05:19.523
Irony.

05:35.159 --> 05:36.546
Bottle of Old Grand-Dad.

05:37.466 --> 05:39.046
Looks like Agent Clements
might've been drinking

05:39.046 --> 05:40.066
before he crashed.

05:40.499 --> 05:41.608
He didn't crash.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.875
The man brings bento boxes to work.

05:43.875 --> 05:45.415
He takes bee pollen in pill form.

05:45.415 --> 05:47.065
There's no way that he was
drinking on the job,

05:47.065 --> 05:50.045
and if he <i>was,</i> he'd be drinking
much better booze.

05:50.045 --> 05:52.486
They found footprints leading into
the woods from the driver's side.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.045
- They're not his.
- Well, whose are they, then?

05:54.045 --> 05:55.075
The guy that took him.

05:55.075 --> 05:56.659
The same guy that took Adam Warren.

05:56.659 --> 05:58.420
Clements calls him, uh, Pocky?

05:59.598 --> 06:00.818
You know, as... as a joke?

06:01.362 --> 06:02.382
Detective, have you heard the saying

06:02.382 --> 06:04.352
"When you hear hoofbeats, think horses"?

06:04.352 --> 06:06.402
He was working on the case
when he disappeared.

06:06.402 --> 06:08.067
We'll take that into consideration.

06:08.092 --> 06:09.979
You're wasting your time... and his!

06:11.422 --> 06:12.492
I'm so sorry.

06:12.492 --> 06:14.392
I'm so sorry.

06:16.402 --> 06:18.073
Mmm.

06:19.058 --> 06:20.088
Goulash.

06:22.158 --> 06:23.432
Who was Hungarian?

06:25.342 --> 06:26.432
My father.

06:26.831 --> 06:27.891
Is he still living?

06:28.350 --> 06:29.412
No.

06:29.788 --> 06:31.067
Was he proud of you?

06:31.797 --> 06:32.491
[Voice breaking] I guess.

06:33.004 --> 06:34.452
Lucky he's dead.

06:36.292 --> 06:37.764
You're in a pickle, Jane.

06:38.947 --> 06:41.843
You got an FBI agent
tied up in your basement.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.969
Now, that's bad all by itself,

06:43.969 --> 06:46.352
but on top of it,
I'm not feeling so hot.

06:46.916 --> 06:48.471
I'm starting to sweat,
I've got the chills,

06:48.472 --> 06:51.352
'cause that head wound
you gave me is infected.

06:51.352 --> 06:53.462
And that sucks on many levels.

06:53.772 --> 06:55.876
Not just for me, but for you.

06:57.195 --> 06:58.372
'Cause the only thing worse

06:58.372 --> 07:00.312
than having a live FBI agent

is having a <i>dead</i> one.

07:07.322 --> 07:09.118
Yeah. You keep saying that.

What are <i>you</i> doing here?

- Got a minute?
- I actually don't right now.

in the 10 years you owe me.

What's in the bag?

07:36.939 --> 07:38.215
In prison,

07:38.240 --> 07:41.775
they call the sex offenders
the dirty inmates.

07:41.982 --> 07:44.365
Everyone knows the dirty.

07:45.812 --> 07:46.992
He's the one that has to sign a waiver

07:46.992 --> 07:48.386
to stay in general pop.

He's the one you hear screaming
after lights out.

07:52.585 --> 07:54.161
That's when they clean the dirty.

07:54.962 --> 07:56.520

You're not in prison anymore.

- I beg to differ.
- You've been exonerated.

08:01.853 --> 08:03.153
Is that what you think?

08:03.153 --> 08:05.195
I think if you're unhappy,
it's your own fault.

08:07.244 --> 08:09.335
You always did jump to conclusions.

08:10.064 --> 08:11.063
What do you want?

08:11.735 --> 08:15.322
I want a world where good things
happen to good people

08:15.349 --> 08:17.339
and bad things happen to bad people.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.814
We need more heroes.

08:19.448 --> 08:21.063
So you're going to make me one.

08:21.558 --> 08:22.509
Why's that?

08:23.168 --> 08:24.889
The man you are looking for

08:25.555 --> 08:27.595
was at my house 10 years ago.

08:27.962 --> 08:29.969
That's where he spotted Adam Warren.

08:30.592 --> 08:33.086
He was also at the rally that night.

What's in the bag?

08:37.772 --> 08:40.466
[Chuckles]

08:40.466 --> 08:42.100
I'm gonna solve your case.

08:42.779 --> 08:43.839
And when I do,

08:43.864 --> 08:46.967
you're going to tell
the whole world that I did it,

08:47.912 --> 08:50.257
that <i>I</i> caught your monster,

08:50.992 --> 08:54.738
that <i>I</i> cleaned... your dirty.

08:54.982 --> 08:56.306
What's in the bag, Hank?

09:08.225 --> 09:10.245
The rest of my life.

09:15.307 --> 09:16.527
<i>No one seemed to be watching him.</i>

09:17.207 --> 09:19.193
<i>- Were you alone?</i>
<i>- At the booth.</i>

09:19.193 --> 09:21.020
<i>And then I met up with</i>
<i>my girlfriend later for dinner.</i>

09:21.087 --> 09:22.177
<i>And you were with your girlfriend</i>

09:22.177 --> 09:23.587
<i>- for the rest of the night?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

09:24.138 --> 09:26.148
<i>Would you mind writing her number down?</i>

09:26.148 --> 09:27.178
<i>No. No, not at all.</i>

09:27.178 --> 09:29.058
<i>Anything else I can help you with?</i>

09:29.058 --> 09:30.058
<i>No. Thanks for coming down.</i>

09:31.048 --> 09:32.128
<i>Anything else I can help you with?</i>

09:32.128 --> 09:33.248
<i>No. Thanks for co...</i>

09:33.248 --> 09:35.198
<i>Anything else I can help you with?</i>

09:35.372 --> 09:37.352
- He had an alibi.
- His girlfriend,

09:37.352 --> 09:39.032
- who works at the oil refinery.
- Meyer.

09:39.105 --> 09:41.302
I bet you Doug had a VIP tour
of those bunkers.

09:41.302 --> 09:42.412
You didn't know.

09:42.412 --> 09:43.984
I spoke to her so many times.

09:44.009 --> 09:45.543
- You didn't know!
- I should've.

09:45.816 --> 09:47.352
I had all the pieces
right in front of me.

09:47.352 --> 09:48.382
I just didn't put them together.

09:48.382 --> 09:49.402
So what's the move?

09:49.402 --> 09:51.162
A tactical team is being assembled.

09:51.162 --> 09:52.242
Did the Warren kid I.D. him?

09:52.242 --> 09:53.682
There's no time. Plus, he's unreliable.

09:53.729 --> 09:54.482
Do you have a warrant?

09:54.482 --> 09:56.141
I got a gun that shoots people.

09:56.141 --> 09:57.432
- You get a warrant.
- Len!

09:57.432 --> 09:59.392
You're gonna get him. You deserve to.

09:59.392 --> 10:01.272
But you do it by the book this time.

10:03.149 --> 10:04.382
Bridey: What are you doing?

10:04.382 --> 10:05.856
Just buried at the office.

10:05.881 --> 10:07.604
Yeah? What's going on.

10:08.352 --> 10:10.270
Just the usual chaos.

10:10.597 --> 10:12.124
Trying to get the last ad buys in

10:12.158 --> 10:14.178

10:14.563 --> 10:16.247
I... No, the Energy Commission studies,

10:16.248 --> 10:17.298
and I need them yesterday.
