# Sarah and Duck. #
QUACK!

00:16.560 --> 00:21.720
Today, Sarah and Duck are out to buy
a new mouthpiece for Sarah's tuba.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.120
Oh! It's closed.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.760
I've returned!
QUACK!

00:33.680 --> 00:35.760
Now, what can I do for you?

00:35.760 --> 00:37.760
One mouthpiece, please.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.920
Very good. This way.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.080
SHE HUMS A TUNE

00:46.840 --> 00:48.800
A tuba, wasn't it?

00:48.800 --> 00:50.800
SHE HUMS AGAIN

00:50.800 --> 00:53.080
It's nice. What? The tune!

00:53.080 --> 00:54.720
Oh, thank you.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.960
It's a duet I'm playing
with the Cloud Captain.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.040
He's a marvellous flautist.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.880
Duet?

01:01.880 --> 01:03.000
Er, yes... Oh!

MOUTHPIECE RASPS
QUACK!

01:04.920 --> 01:07.000
Ooh! You were saying?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.200
A duet is when two people
play music together.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.280
A little something like this.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.680
If you please!

01:21.080 --> 01:24.960
Hmm, how odd, it was playing
perfectly well at Cloud Captain's.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.680
Must be a blockage.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.360
Would you mind?

01:30.400 --> 01:32.040
And...pull!

01:35.000 --> 01:36.760
Now! On my count...

01:36.760 --> 01:39.600
One, two, three, PUSH!

01:43.880 --> 01:45.520
What do we have here?

01:45.520 --> 01:48.720
Good gracious!
It's Captain Parkside's pet cloud!

01:48.720 --> 01:49.920
Hello!

01:49.920 --> 01:53.680
We'd better take you back
to the Cloud Tower.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.320
Do-ooh! You little rascal!

01:56.320 --> 01:57.880
Quick! After it!

02:01.000 --> 02:03.520
Where did it go? Hmm.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.080
Why are you hiding?

02:25.080 --> 02:27.720
I don't think he wants to go home!

02:27.720 --> 02:30.240
But why did he leave
in the first place?

02:30.240 --> 02:33.280
Maybe he liked the music.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.440
Oh, well!

02:35.440 --> 02:36.800
Let's see.

My word, you're a natural!

03:19.040 --> 03:20.400
Hmm.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.200
I think I know
how to get this cloud home.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.400
THEY PLAY A SONG

03:42.320 --> 03:45.280
Looks like our musical cloud
has a fan!

03:45.280 --> 03:46.360
Hello!

03:53.440 --> 03:54.560
Oh!

04:32.560 --> 04:35.720
Quoi?! But you're not in your....

04:35.720 --> 04:37.720
How did you...?

04:37.720 --> 04:39.960
Mmm. May we come in?

04:39.960 --> 04:42.280
Mais oui, but of course!

04:42.280 --> 04:44.840
Um, thank you Cloud Captain. Ooh!

04:49.520 --> 04:51.400
What is going on, mes amis?

04:51.400 --> 04:54.960
Seems your pet cloud
is a bit of a stowaway.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.080
It wanted its own instrument.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.520
Vraiment?

Oh, I had no idea
you were so musical!

05:04.800 --> 05:09.320
The only problem is, the other
clouds like the music, too.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.800
Oh, zut alors!

05:13.600 --> 05:16.960
