00:43.960 --> 00:46.880
Toast. How are you
finding Uncle Sam?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.040
Who?

00:48.040 --> 00:50.520
Uncle Sam. The old US of A.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.120
It's exactly as I expected.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.080
Well, you know what they say.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.280
Sorry, who is this?

01:06.280 --> 01:09.920
It's Ed.
Calling collect from England.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.320
You haven't forgotten me already,
old chap? Oh, yes. Sorry, Ed.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.080
Found anywhere to stay?

01:15.080 --> 01:18.760
Listen, guess who's landed a role
in the latest Star Wars movie.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.520
I'll give you a clue.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.080
Not only is he a great actor,

01:23.080 --> 01:26.480
but also a good friend of yours.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.680
Hopkins?

01:27.680 --> 01:29.320
No.
Ian McKellen?

01:29.320 --> 01:31.680
No.
Tom Conti?

01:31.680 --> 01:33.120
No!

01:33.120 --> 01:34.760
Wow, you've stumped me there, Toast.

01:34.760 --> 01:40.240
Not only is he a fantastic actor,
but also a great friend of yours.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.720
Patrick Stewart?

01:41.720 --> 01:43.560
No! Fucking hell, Ed, it's me.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.720
Ah.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.280
Found anywhere to stay yet?

01:46.280 --> 01:48.880
Well, Ed, as luck would have it,
I sat next to this chap,

01:48.880 --> 01:50.920
Russ Nightlife, on the plane.

01:50.920 --> 01:54.080
He reckoned he needed the rent,
so he give me his address.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.480
That's a stroke of luck.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.040
Strange thing is, he disappeared
halfway through the flight.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.360
I didn't even see him
get off the plane.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.800
That's odd. Have you reported
this to the police?

02:02.800 --> 02:04.800
To the LAPD?

02:04.800 --> 02:06.320
To the FBI?

02:06.320 --> 02:10.640
Calm down, Ed, I think someone might
have watched too much of The Quincy.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.040
So how are you enjoying
the climate, Toast?

02:13.040 --> 02:14.680
Is it always this hot?

02:14.680 --> 02:17.280
You've got some mail.
Really? What is it?

02:17.280 --> 02:19.920
It's just a postcard.
Not worth forwarding on.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.320
Well, who's it from?

02:21.320 --> 02:22.840
It's from Greta Thunberg.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.200
She must know you're
a climate sceptic.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.360
Well, with this heat, I'm beginning
to think Greta has a fair point.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.840
Look, I can't talk to you any longer,
I'd better get back

02:34.840 --> 02:37.000
to the apartment
to see Russ Nightlife.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.320
All the best.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.440
I say, waiter!

02:49.160 --> 02:51.280
Is it always this hot?

02:51.280 --> 02:55.280
My previous roommate was in
the apartment for six months.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.480
He died. Kounis syndrome.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.120
Poor Kounis.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.320
That wasn't his name.
It's the disease he died of.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.800
Oh, sorry, I thought
it was his name.

03:05.800 --> 03:09.640
No, his name was Razzmatazz.
Hercule Razzmatazz.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.320
Thanks for letting me stay, Russ.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.120
You've done me a huge favour.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.720
Did I mention I've got a large part
in the new Star Wars movie?

03:17.720 --> 03:19.680
Yeah. Sure.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.400
Out of interest,

03:23.400 --> 03:25.760
why did you disappear
halfway through the flight?

03:25.760 --> 03:29.040
One minute we were chatting...
OK, Toast, I'll level with you.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.200
I don't have many rules
or regs here,

03:31.200 --> 03:34.600
but I've got to insist that my
roommates be respectable and neat.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.000
You got that?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.480
Understood.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.600
I also don't want you bringing back
any Goddamn hook-ups.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.760
Hook-ups?

03:41.760 --> 03:43.160
That's right.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.240
I'm not up to speed
on your situation,

03:45.240 --> 03:48.560
but looking at you, I'm guessing
that you're a single guy.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.360
I don't mean to smash
your action,

03:51.360 --> 03:53.400
but I've got to keep it clean.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.800
I can't have any strangers
in this apartment snooping around.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.640
So no strangers, no snooping,
and no Goddamn hook-ups.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.320
Fair enough.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.280
Erm, I'll use a motel.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.200
Anyhoo, here's the key.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.880
What?

04:09.880 --> 04:12.080
I'm just fooling around.
That's a joke key.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.400
Oh!

04:13.400 --> 04:15.720
We don't use a key any more,
we use a code.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.040
6789

04:17.040 --> 04:19.640
3654 7011

04:19.640 --> 04:22.160
001 4603

04:22.160 --> 04:23.640
279 601

04:23.640 --> 04:26.040
111 395.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.880
Will you remember that?
No!

04:27.880 --> 04:29.480
I'm going to text it to you.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.880
All right, I just sent you the code.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.480
I need you to memorise it and then
immediately delete it

04:47.480 --> 04:49.320
from your cell. Capisce?
Capisce.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.160
Ah, I need to take this.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.880
Has he not answered yet, India?

05:02.880 --> 05:05.560
Ugh, no point in getting
him to call me back,

05:05.560 --> 05:07.560
because he's as tight
as a duck's arse,

05:07.560 --> 05:09.280
and they're watertight. Ha!

05:09.280 --> 05:11.320
Is that right, Jane?

05:11.320 --> 05:13.320
I'm guessing you have
tremendous news.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.960
I have tremendous news.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.200
Which is?

05:17.200 --> 05:18.960
Ray Sober is dead.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.240
What?

05:20.240 --> 05:22.600
Ray Sober is dead.
Ray Sober?

05:22.600 --> 05:25.680
Yes, you remember him,
Ray Sober, the actor.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.920
You hated him.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.760
Oh, Ray Sober, yeah.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.920
He was that prick that sent me off
to fetch him a skyhook

05:31.920 --> 05:34.440
and some tartan paint
on my first job.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.000
Ha! The classic fool's errand.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.560
Well, I'm glad he's dead, but why
is that tremendous news, Jane?

05:40.560 --> 05:45.120
Well, Ray Sober was about to star
in a major film over there,

05:45.120 --> 05:48.160
but now, because he's dead,
they fear he won't turn up,

05:48.160 --> 05:51.160
so I reckon you're a shoo-in
for the role.

05:51.160 --> 05:55.920
And apparently, it's going to be the
biggest rom com film of all time.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.560
Rom com?

05:57.560 --> 05:59.840
Do you mean Romley Compton,
the actor?

05:59.840 --> 06:01.680
I didn't even know he was in films.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.680
No, not Romley Compton the actor,
rom com.

06:04.680 --> 06:09.360
It's short for romantic comedy,
like Love Actually

06:09.360 --> 06:11.960
or The Four Weddings
And The Funeral.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.440
I haven't heard
of either of those.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.240
Hang on a second, so I will be
starring in the biggest

06:17.240 --> 06:19.400
science fiction film of all time,

06:19.400 --> 06:22.200
and the biggest rom com film
of all time?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.720
Isn't it amazing?

06:23.720 --> 06:26.160
The biggest science fiction film
of all time

06:26.160 --> 06:29.320
and the biggest rom com film
of all time.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.400
You'll make $1 billion.

06:31.400 --> 06:35.320
$1 billion? Well, I'll take
a pinch of that shit.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.480
Ha!

06:36.480 --> 06:38.120
As long as I'm not
playing the butler.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.960
What?
Brits in Hollywood.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.000
They're always playing butlers,
and if not butlers, murderers.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.880
No, no, you won't be
playing the butler.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.920
Well, what's the plan?
Do you remember Brooke Hooberman?

06:48.920 --> 06:50.480
Yes, I remember.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.920
She handles all the Brits
over there.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.360
I'll text you her number.
Call her pronto.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.560
Is it always this hot, Pronto?

07:09.560 --> 07:12.360
Why are you calling me Pronto?

07:12.360 --> 07:13.680
I don't know.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.440
Jane said to call you that.
Is it a nickname or something?

07:16.440 --> 07:18.920
No, don't call me Pronto.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.880
My name is Brooke Hooberman.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.840
May I ask,
is this your permanent office?

07:29.840 --> 07:31.560
It seems to be a car.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.440
I love British actors.

07:33.440 --> 07:37.000
I've handled them over here
for Goddamn years.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.160
Peter O'Toole, love him.

07:39.160 --> 07:43.360
Larry Olivier, Ollie Reed,
all great guys.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.080
Are they doing OK?

07:45.080 --> 07:48.000
Well, I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, but...

07:48.000 --> 07:50.720
Ray Sober is dead.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.960
Poor bastard can't do the movie now,
he's dead.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.960
Jane recommended you, and the
director took a look at your reel...

07:57.960 --> 08:00.840
he thinks you're the Goddamn guy.

08:00.840 --> 08:05.320
You got a bit of time
before the Star Wars movie, right?

08:05.320 --> 08:08.120
You mean the biggest science fiction
movie of all time?

08:08.120 --> 08:12.120
Yeah, anyway, the director
is Dwight Difference.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.520
I'll arrange a Zoom call with him.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.440
All right. Well, as long as
I'm not playing the butler.

08:20.440 --> 08:21.680
What?

08:21.680 --> 08:24.400
You know, British actors,
always playing the butler

08:24.400 --> 08:26.040
or the murderer.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.160
It is the butler.
You'll be playing the butler.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.320
Right.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.600
But the butler turns out
to be the murderer,

08:33.600 --> 08:36.040
so you're playing the butler
<i>AND </i>the murderer.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.800
I thought it was a rom com.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.640
A what?

08:39.640 --> 08:43.320
Dwight signed up a real A-lister
to play the lead.

08:43.320 --> 08:47.480
This guy wants to meet you before
they officially offer you the part.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.240
Who is this A-lister?

08:49.240 --> 08:54.560
Ah, Dwight's keeping shtoom,
but he's big.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.880
Oh, I need you to do me
a Goddamn favour.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.360
What?

09:04.360 --> 09:07.080
Are you friends with David Bowie?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.480
What?

09:08.480 --> 09:11.400
Well, you're from London,
you must know David.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.000
I have something belonging to him.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.440
You know the suit he wore
in the 1983 Serious Moonlight tour?

09:16.440 --> 09:18.040
No.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.320
Well, it's in that suitcase
next to you.

09:21.320 --> 09:25.600
He left it here years ago,
and then he never collected it.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.040
Could you give that back to him
next time you see him in London?

09:29.040 --> 09:33.120
Well, again, I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, Brooke, but...

09:33.120 --> 09:34.880
Could you do that for me, Toast?

09:34.880 --> 09:36.160
OK.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.960
I've got to meet my next actress.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.320
Right.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.240
You've got to get out,
I've got to meet my next girl.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.920
Oh, right, OK.

09:50.440 --> 09:56.680
Ah, Natasia, great news
about the vampire comedy, huh?

10:10.480 --> 10:11.600
Hey.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.040
Didn't mean to barge in.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.320
Wasn't sure where you were.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.320
Well, you can see me
through the glass.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.120
Could you get that?
Get what?

10:19.120 --> 10:20.920
It's Billy.
Could you just buzz her in?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.560
Who's Billy? What time is it?

10:22.560 --> 10:23.880
It's 6.00am.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.440
What?

10:39.880 --> 10:41.120
Hello?

10:49.960 --> 10:51.800
Yeah, I'm letting you in.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.640
What?

11:15.200 --> 11:16.240
Who is she?

11:16.240 --> 11:18.600
What?
Who is that woman?

11:18.600 --> 11:20.160
Hold on a second.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.280
What were you saying?

11:28.280 --> 11:29.560
Who is that lady?

11:29.560 --> 11:31.480
That's Billy. She helps me out.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.560
Billy, can I have a can of soda?

12:13.160 --> 12:14.400
What do you think of that?

12:20.360 --> 12:22.000
Shit!

12:29.320 --> 12:30.920
Did you ever do that
at immigration?

12:30.920 --> 12:35.400
No, but as an actor, I've found it
useful for both comedy and drama.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.360
Ah. My agent, checking in.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.760
Your agent?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.080
You with the FBI?

12:42.080 --> 12:44.000
No, my acting agent.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.080
Oh!

12:46.320 --> 12:48.040
I'm just going to go lie down.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.760
OK.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.440
He's in a funny mood.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.000
But hey, guess he's always in
a funny mood.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.360
You speak English?
Yeah!

13:05.360 --> 13:07.320
Just not in front
of Russ Nightlife.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.400
It's easier that way.
He's not the kind of person

13:09.400 --> 13:11.440
you want to get into a long
conversation with.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.880
It's best if he thinks
I don't speak English.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.080
Yeah, he is very odd.
Yeah.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.160
He rarely leaves this apartment.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.880
And don't provoke him,
because he'll get frightened

13:20.880 --> 13:22.720
and he'll try to fight you.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.200
You know that whole
fight or flight response

13:25.200 --> 13:27.520
to a tense situation?
Yes.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.760
What would you do?

13:28.760 --> 13:31.000
Well, it would depend
on the situation.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.600
Yeah, he is <i>VERY </i>odd.
Mm.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.160
Hey, you know what? I've got to go
Zoom with this British guy,

13:42.160 --> 13:43.720
so I'll call you back, all right?

13:43.720 --> 13:45.160
Holy Moley!

13:45.160 --> 13:46.600
Holy mackerel.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.400
Oh, my God, Catherine, if you could
see what I'm looking at right now.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.960
He looks like he's calling
from jail.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.560
He looks like a sex nuisance.

13:52.560 --> 13:56.360
Erm, hello there. Just so you know,
you're not muted.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.800
Shit. Hey, Catherine,
I'm going to call you back.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.400
I am so sorry.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.760
It's OK.
I am incredibly mortified.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.960
I am so sorry.
No. Forget it.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.280
I'm Steven Toast, and I'm assuming
you're Dwight Difference.

14:08.280 --> 14:12.200
I am Dwight Difference, and I am
very excited about the possibility

14:12.200 --> 14:13.760
of us working together.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.480
I met with Brooke Hooberman,
who suggested I get in touch

14:16.480 --> 14:18.920
with you regarding
your new motion picture.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.760
Now, when you mentioned my name,
did she sort of mumble

14:21.760 --> 14:23.920
under her breath,
like kind of a growl?

14:23.920 --> 14:27.400
Now you bring it up,
I think she did.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.760
You know, I've got to tell you,
I love your accent.

14:29.760 --> 14:32.120
I love it.
Can you say something else?

14:32.120 --> 14:33.640
Something else.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.480
You know, I love that.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.360
You know Shakespeare?

14:37.360 --> 14:39.200
Let me hear some Shakespeare.
Yeah.

14:39.200 --> 14:45.360
<i>"Drink provokes the desire
but takes away the performance."</i>

14:45.360 --> 14:47.840
That's from Macbeth.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.120
Is that Shakespeare?

14:49.120 --> 14:50.280
Yes, it is.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.160
Is he English?
Yes, he was.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.560
Did not know that.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.960
That is so cool.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.640
You know something?
You're going to be great in my film.

14:57.640 --> 15:01.400
Not to mention the fact that we have
a major star playing the lead.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.960
Really? Who is it?

15:02.960 --> 15:04.520
I bet you want to know.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.560
I got to tell you this,
he's British, just like you,

15:07.560 --> 15:08.960
and he's a little reclusive,

15:08.960 --> 15:11.360
so he wants to meet you before
I offer you the part.

15:11.360 --> 15:14.480
It's a formality, but everything's
going to be all right, OK?

15:14.480 --> 15:16.200
It's going to be beautiful.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.000
Did I mention I'm starring
in the new Star Wars movie?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.560
Yeah, sure.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.120
All right, so I've got to go.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.640
I will see you at the Canyon Cafe,
4.00 this afternoon.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.000
Say it after me.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.840
Canyon Cafe, 4.00. I'll be there.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.240
I love that accent.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.880
Oh, by the way, remember to wear
some tennis shorts.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.600
Tennis shorts?

15:41.600 --> 15:43.280
Jim!

15:43.280 --> 15:44.800
Hey, Steven.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.200
Nice shorts, man.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.640
I thought you were in Paris.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.360
How's Jane?

15:49.360 --> 15:52.440
Jane's good, yeah.
I'm glad I saw you, hold on.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.880
I'll just give you my...

15:55.440 --> 15:57.080
What the f...?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.360
Hey!

16:10.360 --> 16:13.760
I'm Nina Armenian,
Dwight's assistant.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.800
All right. Dwight suddenly had to
take a short skiing holiday,

16:16.800 --> 16:19.680
but I'll be organising things
for you today.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.600
He what? He had to suddenly
take a skiing holiday.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.800
He says it's too hot in LA.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.600
Well, he's right about that.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.160
When do I get to meet
this major star?

16:29.160 --> 16:32.920
Our major star is British,
and like a lot of you British guys,

16:32.920 --> 16:35.520
he's kind of eccentric, you know?

16:35.520 --> 16:38.000
And he wants you to
do something for him.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.440
What's that?

16:39.440 --> 16:41.040
He needs to see your knees.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.200
He's got this thing about knees.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.720
Are you serious?

16:44.720 --> 16:47.360
He says the knees have to look right
and not be too distracting,

16:47.360 --> 16:50.080
otherwise it's a deal-breaker.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.320
Well, this is bloody odd.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.800
Not how I thought I'd get my
first major Hollywood movie role.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.480
Never a dull moment
in Hollywood, right?

16:58.480 --> 17:00.360
What?
Follow me, please.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.600
Is that a two-way mirror?

17:11.600 --> 17:13.680
Yes! How did you guess?

17:13.680 --> 17:15.280
He's behind the mirror.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.720
Yeah, I thought so.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.440
This is going so great.

17:18.440 --> 17:22.120
He's now asked if you could turn
and stand in profile.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.440
Bit kinky, all this, isn't it?

17:29.440 --> 17:32.400
Wouldn't be surprised if it was
Mark Rylance behind the mirror.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.840
I know he's into this
kind of rumshenanigan.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.800
He says he's very grateful.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.120
I bet he is.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.440
When do I get to meet him?

17:39.440 --> 17:40.720
Not just yet.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.680
He says he doesn't feel quite ready.
He's sure you understand.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.120
Understand what?

17:47.120 --> 17:50.520
Makes me wonder what kind of crazy
shit he'll get up to on set.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.760
Oh, great,
he's got everything he needs.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.400
He says you can go now.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.240
The whole thing was very odd indeed.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.160
Russ, can I ask you
a personal question?

18:12.160 --> 18:14.320
Due to our situation,
it could be relevant.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.840
What is it?

18:15.840 --> 18:17.880
Do you have OCD?

18:19.400 --> 18:21.440
You mean obsessive-compulsive
disorder?

18:21.440 --> 18:25.200
Yes. Do you have OCD?

18:25.200 --> 18:27.000
Why do you ask?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.800
Because you've spelt OCD
with your peas.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.480
Oh, weird.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.040
Didn't know I did that,

18:34.040 --> 18:35.880
but no, I don't have OCD.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.280
Ah, thanks.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.960
Hold on, these shrimps,

18:46.960 --> 18:49.840
are they definitely dead?

18:49.840 --> 18:52.760
Billy, did you get these
from the usual fish place?

18:59.120 --> 19:00.920
Yeah, but are they definitely dead?

19:02.080 --> 19:05.360
I thought I saw some movement,
a sign of life.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.120
Well, they look pretty dead to me.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.600
Well, how do you know?!

19:10.600 --> 19:12.880
Billy, did you get any
documentation certifying

19:12.880 --> 19:15.640
that they're definitely dead?

19:23.320 --> 19:24.680
What did she say?

19:24.680 --> 19:27.280
She said they were caught in Alaska,
so she's guessing

19:27.280 --> 19:29.600
there's a fair chance
they didn't survive the journey.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.720
Toast!

19:32.720 --> 19:35.680
I don't think you appreciate
how serious I am about this.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.120
Jesus, this guy looks like a dog.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.840
That Goddamn white streak
makes him look like an asshole.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.880
He looks like a fucking asshole,
like skunkhead.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.440
Maybe he's in the witness
protection programme, I don't know.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.680
Maybe he's going through something.
Just so you know, you're not muted.

19:52.680 --> 19:53.960
Fuck me.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.400
All right, I've got to go. Bye.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.080
I am so sorry.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.960
I am terribly, terribly sorry.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.360
You know, I'm juggling my cellphone,
I've got the iPad...

20:03.360 --> 20:04.920
It's OK.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.400
These things, they happen.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.720
Now, listen, Toast,
I'm so glad you called.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.760
He wants to meet you.
Who does?

20:11.760 --> 20:14.680
<i>"Who does?" </i>Our Goddamn star,
that's who, our A-lister.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.440
He is ready to say hello personally.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.840
Yesterday's knee thing went
so great, and now he thinks

20:21.840 --> 20:25.160
it's time to, you know,
finally meet face-to-face.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.960
Great. When's it happening?

20:26.960 --> 20:29.480
Tomorrow. I'm hosting a big
Hollywood party.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.120
It's a fancy dress party,

20:31.120 --> 20:33.760
a David Bowie-themed fancy
dress party.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.680
Ooh, I like the sound of that.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.360
I'm going as Ziggy Stardust.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.760
Yes, I did think you looked
a little different.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.120
So that look is gone.

20:42.120 --> 20:45.240
You can't look like
Ziggy Stardust, OK?

20:45.240 --> 20:48.360
You need another David Bowie
costume, because as I say,

20:48.360 --> 20:50.400
Ziggy is gone.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.480
No Ziggy. Very well.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.520
This movie's going to be
my best ever, I can smell it.

21:22.520 --> 21:26.080
Great. I did presume you were
going to be here.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.080
I'm actually in Alaska.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.560
It's such a shame I can't meet you
in person, Toast,

21:30.560 --> 21:33.600
but it won't stop me
from enjoying this party.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.160
Anyway, our star
is dying to meet you.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.800
Is he here yet?

21:39.400 --> 21:41.160
I don't see him there.

21:41.160 --> 21:45.200
One thing, Toast, you see anybody
else dressed like Ziggy Stardust,

21:45.200 --> 21:47.200
tell Nina Armenian to throw 'em out,
all right?

21:51.240 --> 21:52.600
Hello?

21:52.600 --> 21:55.320
Hi, I'm Paul Rudd, I'm here
for the Dwight Difference party.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.400
Are you dressed as Ziggy Stardust?

21:57.400 --> 21:58.920
Yes.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.760
I'm so sorry, Dwight's already
selected that costume,

22:01.760 --> 22:04.320
so I'm afraid you're not allowed
to enter the premises.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.880
Drink, sir?

22:10.880 --> 22:12.480
Why not?

22:21.160 --> 22:22.920
I knew David Bowie.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.240
Charming chap.
Always carried explosives.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.720
Is it always this hot?

22:28.720 --> 22:30.360
Are you English?

22:30.360 --> 22:33.480
Yes. Is it that obvious?
I'm an actor.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.840
Are you Anthony Hopkins?

22:35.840 --> 22:37.400
No. He's Welsh.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.000
I'm actually here because I'm
starring in the new Star Wars movie.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.880
Yeah, sure.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.120
What did you say?

22:45.120 --> 22:47.560
I said make sure you see
the beautiful garden.

22:47.560 --> 22:52.520
It was actually the first garden
in America, created in 1965.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.800
You never know
who you might see there.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.800
I saw Simon Garfunkel once.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.960
Oh, it's one person?

22:59.960 --> 23:02.360
For years, I assumed
they were a double act.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.920
Anyway, you might bump into
a few celebrities out there.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.000
OK, sounds great.
Do you fancy a stroll?

23:11.000 --> 23:14.520
Sorry, sir, I'm not allowed
to socialise in any way with guests.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.200
Ah, wishing well.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.720
So it is.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.160
Ooh!

23:36.800 --> 23:39.800
I knew very little of science
fiction before I accepted the role,

23:39.800 --> 23:44.320
so to win this Oscar
is very special.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.360
Very special indeed.

23:47.640 --> 23:48.840
Thank you.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.600
Hello.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.480
Toast, Toast, snap out of it.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.280
Toast! Snap out of it!

24:17.280 --> 24:18.880
Where a...? Where am I?

24:18.880 --> 24:20.840
What the hell happened, Steven?

24:20.840 --> 24:25.880
I was attacked by a man in a
David Bowie Ashes To Ashes costume.

24:25.880 --> 24:29.360
This man?
That's him. That's who attacked me.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.280
Shit, that's just Daniel
being Daniel.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.880
Who?
Daniel Day-Lewis, you goof.

24:33.880 --> 24:36.320
That's who.
He's the A-lister in our movie.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.680
Daniel Day-Lewis was
the Ashes To Ashes man?

24:39.680 --> 24:43.840
Yes. He just wanted to say hello.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.840
Jesus, I think you might have
blown it, Steven.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.840
I mean, you bit his ear off.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.120
I what?

24:49.120 --> 24:50.920
You lost all control, Toast.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.920
Daniel has gone straight to the
hospital whilst his team search

24:53.920 --> 24:55.680
the gardens for his missing ear.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.440
Really? What the fuck's
the matter with you?

24:58.440 --> 25:00.320
They've been looking for it
for three hours.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.720
Do you remember biting it off,
Steven? No.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.640
I mean, I may have
slightly panicked, you know,

25:04.640 --> 25:07.560
the fight or flight response
to a tense situation.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.240
I chose fight.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.280
Which was the wrong response.

25:11.280 --> 25:14.280
Yes, in hindsight,
I should have chosen flight.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.920
Do you think this might affect
our movie?

25:18.920 --> 25:21.480
Nina, take me inside.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.880
Yes, Dwight.
No, wait, wait...

25:23.880 --> 25:25.640
Dumb Limey asshole.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.640
Should've known not to hire someone
who looks like a pimp from the '70s.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.600
Apart from the fight
with Daniel Day-Lewis,

25:33.600 --> 25:35.440
where they claim I bit his ear off,

25:35.440 --> 25:38.040
I'd say the party
was a huge success.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.520
The movie's not going ahead.

25:40.520 --> 25:41.920
Finished.

25:41.920 --> 25:45.040
You messed up big time, buddy.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.920
Daniel Day-Lewis has pulled out.
You bit his Goddamn ear off.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.680
He's gone into retirement.

25:50.680 --> 25:53.560
He's never going to make a movie
ever again.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.920
Bit of an overreaction,
wouldn't you say?

25:55.920 --> 25:58.160
You bit his ear off!

25:58.160 --> 26:00.640
I've no recollection
of that at all.

26:00.640 --> 26:04.720
It doesn't matter what you recollect,
you crazy bastard,

26:04.720 --> 26:06.920
the main thing is the movie
is not happening.

26:06.920 --> 26:09.400
My son-in-law...

26:06.920 --> 26:09.400
SHE GROWLS

26:09.400 --> 26:11.280
...is real pissed.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.440
Well, thank goodness I still have
the Star Wars movie

26:14.440 --> 26:15.680
to look forward to.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.640
Have you seen the state
of David Bowie's costume?

26:18.640 --> 26:20.840
What the hell
are you going to tell him?

26:20.840 --> 26:23.080
Tell who?

26:23.080 --> 26:25.720
OK, here's my next meeting.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.920
Good God, it's Edward Fox.

26:30.920 --> 26:34.440
Toast? What the hell
are you doing here in LA?

26:34.440 --> 26:37.240
I'm starring in the new
Star Wars movie.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.760
Yeah, sure.

26:39.760 --> 26:43.000
What's this rumshenanigan
I hear about you

26:43.000 --> 26:46.240
chomping off Daniel Day-Lewis' ear?

26:46.240 --> 26:49.880
The poor bugger just
came out of retirement.

26:49.880 --> 26:51.400
How the hell did you know that?

26:51.400 --> 26:53.000
Toast, your time with me is over.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.320
I'm now in a meeting with
Edward Fox.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.960
Please vacate the vehicle.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.440
Toodle-pip, Toast.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.400
Where's Billy?

27:11.400 --> 27:13.720
Don't worry about Billy.
Billy's going to be fine.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.920
You just concentrate
on standing still,

27:15.920 --> 27:17.800
and put that apple on your head.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.400
You got a problem with that?

27:19.400 --> 27:20.720
If I'm honest, Russ,

27:20.720 --> 27:23.760
it's not really the Tinseltown
experience I imagined.

27:23.760 --> 27:27.520
Just put the apple on your head,
keep the dialogue to a minimum,

27:27.520 --> 27:30.760
and your head... still.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.640
All right.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
TOAST GROANS
