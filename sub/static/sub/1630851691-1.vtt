Marcie:
<i> The last couple of years</i>
<i> have been tough, right?</i>

00:04.038 --> 00:05.437
<i> Challenging.</i>

00:06.573 --> 00:07.439
<i> We've had to fight</i>
<i> for the little things</i>

00:07.475 --> 00:09.775
<i> That make us feel human.</i>

00:10.945 --> 00:13.111
<i> We've had to get used</i>
<i> to a life in stasis.</i>

00:14.081 --> 00:15.314
<i> Praying that you</i>
<i> get to finish</i>

00:15.449 --> 00:18.216
<i>Whatever you were in the middle</i>
<i> of when the world changed.</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:21.653
<i> Don't get me wrong,</i>

00:21.722 --> 00:24.656
<i> Life in the midst of a</i>
<i> pandemic wasn't all bad.</i>

00:25.192 --> 00:26.458
Cheers.

00:26.593 --> 00:27.826
Cheers.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.696
Marcie:
<i> We were reminded of how</i>
<i> much we love our loved ones.</i>

00:33.234 --> 00:36.334
<i> We "bubbled" with strangers</i>
<i> and made lifelong friends.</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:37.736
Hey, hold on!

00:37.738 --> 00:39.805
Marcie:
<i> And while most of us</i>
<i> were dealing with a virus</i>

00:39.874 --> 00:44.576
<i>That made being socially distant</i>
<i>from loved ones the new normal,</i>

00:44.612 --> 00:48.814
<i> Some of us saw our lives</i>
<i> irrevocably changed by loss.</i>

00:50.084 --> 00:51.283
(colleen sighs)

00:51.352 --> 00:54.286
Marcie:
<i> Every morning, my client,</i>
<i> nina francis,</i>

00:54.288 --> 00:56.688
<i> Would make the journey</i>
<i> from preston to halifax</i>

00:56.690 --> 00:58.823
<i> To work as a</i>
<i> continuing care assistant</i>

00:58.859 --> 01:02.461
<i> At one of oakland park's</i>
<i> long term care facilities.</i>

01:02.530 --> 01:06.298
<i> And she did that job</i>
<i> efficiently, diligently</i>

01:06.367 --> 01:08.100
<i> And with the</i>
<i> greatest of care.</i>

01:08.235 --> 01:09.434
<i> During the pandemic,</i>

01:09.437 --> 01:11.103
<i> She was required</i>
<i> to do this job</i>

01:11.238 --> 01:14.306
<i> Under the</i>
<i> worst circumstances.</i>

01:14.375 --> 01:16.040
<i> Lack of ppe,</i>

01:16.077 --> 01:18.710
<i> No access to n-95 masks,</i>

01:18.712 --> 01:20.378
<i> Being shuttled across</i>
<i> oakland park's</i>

01:20.414 --> 01:22.714
<i> Six long term</i>
<i> care facilities.</i>

01:24.284 --> 01:26.918
<i> My client is charged with</i>
<i> assault with a weapon</i>

01:26.954 --> 01:28.720
<i> And criminal negligence.</i>

01:28.756 --> 01:31.589
<i> She's not guilty,</i>
<i> ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:31.625 --> 01:36.528
Nina francis was confronted
by the complainant at her home,

01:36.663 --> 01:39.564
As she was taking her two
young children to school.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.300
<i> Now the complainant</i>
<i> attacked my client</i>

01:42.302 --> 01:45.170
<i> Because she believed</i>
<i> that ms. Francis</i>

01:45.172 --> 01:47.673
Gave her mother covid-19;

01:47.808 --> 01:50.075
A virus she did succumb to.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.943
<i> My client attempted</i>
<i> to escape</i>

01:51.979 --> 01:54.546
<i> Ms. Macaskill's</i>
<i> unrelenting attack.</i>

01:54.681 --> 01:56.181
<i> And when ms. Eilidh macaskill</i>

01:56.316 --> 02:00.952
Refused to back away
from my client's vehicle,

02:00.988 --> 02:02.354
She was injured.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.958
<i> The crown is gonna tell you</i>
<i> this accident was purposeful.</i>

02:07.928 --> 02:10.496
<i> This case is an</i>
<i> unwarranted attack</i>

02:10.631 --> 02:15.400
<i> On a woman who risked</i>
<i> her own life every day</i>

02:15.536 --> 02:18.503
Through one of the most
unprecedented events

02:18.506 --> 02:19.904
Of our lifetime.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.774
<i> Ladies and gentlemen</i>
<i> of the jury,</i>

02:22.776 --> 02:27.579
<i> Covid-19 has taken so</i>
<i> much from so many people.</i>

02:29.650 --> 02:32.450
Don't allow it to claim
nina francis' freedom

02:32.486 --> 02:33.785
And her family too.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.621
Please find her
not guilty.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.623
Thank you.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.527
Judge kilcoyne:
<i> Call your first witness.</i>

02:42.530 --> 02:43.862
Yes your honour.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.463
We call
eilidh macaskill

02:45.499 --> 02:46.831
To the witness stand.

Ms. Macaskill,

03:30.711 --> 03:32.844
There's no doubt
that video must be
triggering for you.

03:32.846 --> 03:33.779
<i>Do you need a moment?</i>

03:33.914 --> 03:34.846
I'm good.

03:34.882 --> 03:35.814
Bethany:
<i>Okay.</i>

03:35.949 --> 03:38.717
Now, can you tell the
court what happened

03:38.786 --> 03:42.320
After the accused's
truck made
contact with you?

03:42.389 --> 03:45.123
I'm not sure,
I just remember
being in a lot of pain.

03:45.125 --> 03:48.026
Do you recall if
the accused stopped

03:48.062 --> 03:49.361
To see if you
were okay?

03:49.964 --> 03:51.029
She just ran off.

03:51.065 --> 03:51.997
Bethany:
<i> She just left the scene?</i>

03:52.066 --> 03:53.064
Eilidh:
<i> Yes.</i>

03:53.133 --> 03:55.133
And she didn't
come to your aid?

03:55.135 --> 03:56.969
No. She ran
inside her house.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.137
<i>Two guys came from</i>
<i>I don't know where</i>

03:59.173 --> 04:00.806
And I guess they
called an ambulance.

04:00.941 --> 04:01.873
Bethany:
<i> An ambulance?</i>

04:02.009 --> 04:03.875
So you must've been
hurt pretty badly?

04:03.877 --> 04:05.577
My leg was broken
in three places

04:05.712 --> 04:07.379
And I suffered
a concussion.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.513
<i> I'm a cpa.</i>

04:08.549 --> 04:10.949
<i>I've had trouble focusing</i>
<i>since what happened.</i>

04:10.951 --> 04:12.484
Get headaches.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.588
I haven't been able
to go back to work.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.856
How long have you
been off work?

04:17.991 --> 04:19.324
Almost 13 months.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.893
Do you have a sense
from your doctor

04:21.895 --> 04:23.528
When you'll be
able to go back?

04:24.598 --> 04:26.698
They don't know
if I'll be able
to go back.

04:30.237 --> 04:34.639
(gentle music)

04:34.642 --> 04:37.509
Joyce:
<i> So you heard that gregor's</i>
<i> stepping down as chair?</i>

04:37.511 --> 04:39.144
I'll believe
that when I
see it.

04:39.213 --> 04:40.245
Joyce:
<i> Gregor's gone.</i>

04:40.314 --> 04:41.913
He's not even
in the country.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.949
He handed me his
proxy just in case.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.450
Still playing the
puppet master.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.051
Unbelievable.

04:47.855 --> 04:48.987
So who's gonna
replace him?

04:49.923 --> 04:51.790
Well, there's
eugene alfreds,

04:51.859 --> 04:53.258
Quinta tyson,

04:53.327 --> 04:54.259
Percy lincoln.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.261
Percy lincoln?
Seriously?

04:56.263 --> 04:57.395
Joyce:
<i> I wouldn't sweat it.</i>

04:57.531 --> 04:58.864
He's viewed as
too radical.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.631
Even the "left"
has its limits.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.634
Thinking about tossing
your hat in the ring?

05:04.404 --> 05:05.804
Give your head
a shake.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.339
You know how long I've
been trying to reform

05:07.408 --> 05:08.639
Halifax legal aid?

05:09.576 --> 05:11.810
Well, it sounds like
you have ideas.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.612
And the added bonus
is you have history,

05:14.648 --> 05:16.214
Aka you're old.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.849
Thanks, colleen.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.886
I'll think
about it.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.294
Ronnie:
<i> There the big</i>
<i> talking man is.</i>

05:29.296 --> 05:32.030
With your cheap
settler promises.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.698
I thought you were gonna
do something for us.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.533
<i>Now, I'm just</i>
<i>getting this.</i>

05:37.471 --> 05:39.838
We waited five months
for a no?

05:39.907 --> 05:42.907
The government's not
getting their hands
on my niece's kid.

05:42.943 --> 05:43.842
Hey.

05:43.977 --> 05:44.876
Hey, colleen.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.578
<i> You got a minute to</i>
<i> talk about this?</i>

05:46.713 --> 05:48.513
You the boss?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.681
I am, yeah.
How can I help?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.517
Stop screwing us with
your "nos" for a start.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.685
We rejected her claim.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.454
Okay, well you can
always appeal.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.325
Ronnie:
<i> Damn it!</i>

06:04.731 --> 06:06.330
My niece is 16.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.599
She's in the system.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.202
<i> Me and her mother,</i>
<i> we grew up in the system.</i>

06:10.337 --> 06:13.071
After my sister died,
I swore I wouldn't let ivy,

06:14.842 --> 06:17.075
She wasn't supposed to
end up in foster care.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.811
I let her down.

06:20.947 --> 06:23.648
How many more of us
do they get to claim?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.650
<i> That child of hers</i>
<i> belongs with her people.</i>

06:25.786 --> 06:27.652
I need to bring her home.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.489
Here, I want you to
write down your number.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.491
I'll call you this afternoon,
I promise.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.631
(door knocking)

06:39.700 --> 06:42.367
Doug:
<i> Look, I know you said</i>
<i> "no" but this file-</i>

06:42.369 --> 06:44.369
(sighs) there's
always a "file" doug.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.304
We don't have the resources
to take on every case.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.773
It's six or seven hours,
colleen.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.107
<i> Ronnie's niece is</i>
<i> in foster care.</i>

06:49.242 --> 06:51.910
<i> She's 16 and</i>
<i> eight months pregnant.</i>

06:51.912 --> 06:53.177
Ronnie just wants to
be appointed guardian

06:53.213 --> 06:54.179
Of her grand-nephew,

06:54.248 --> 06:55.213
Keep the child
out of care.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.647
<i> It's six or seven hours.</i>

06:57.718 --> 06:59.651
If she registers an
appeal I'll expedite it.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.486
You're not getting this,
colleen.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.821
<i> I'm sorry for taking</i>
<i> this out on you,</i>

07:02.956 --> 07:05.523
But she applied for legal
aid nearly five months ago.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.925
<i> We should be embarrassed</i>
<i> it takes this long</i>

07:06.927 --> 07:08.159
To respond to people.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.528
Wow, that's what
passes as an apology?

07:10.564 --> 07:12.597
Why does this woman
have to fight for help?

07:12.732 --> 07:14.332
We'll give a legal aid
certificate to a murderer

07:14.468 --> 07:16.000
Just like that.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.869
We have to be better.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.705
You have no idea what
I deal with on the daily.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.006
<i> Do more with less,</i>

07:22.042 --> 07:23.542
<i> Take from "peter"</i>
<i> to pay "paul".</i>

07:23.544 --> 07:26.077
The focus this quarter
is women not men,

07:26.079 --> 07:26.978
Black not white.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.481
Agendas are
constantly shifting.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.684
And every time I ask for more
I'm told to make it work.

07:32.819 --> 07:36.087
<i> And that's exactly what</i>
<i> I'm doing every day.</i>

07:36.089 --> 07:37.489
So don't,

07:37.491 --> 07:39.457
Don't come at me
suggesting otherwise.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.960
You're right.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.695
I shouldn't have said that,
I'm just...

07:46.433 --> 07:47.632
Ten hours, doug.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.233
I'll give you ten hours
to work this out.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.168
Thank you.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.235
Thank you, colleen.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.370
Colleen:
<i> And don't get too excited,</i>

07:52.372 --> 07:53.972
I'm not sanctioning court
time on this, all right?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.640
Couple of phone calls,
some meetings,

07:55.709 --> 07:57.442
Keep this really
short and simple.

08:00.214 --> 08:03.248
Bethany:
<i> Why did you choose</i>
<i> oakland park for your mom?</i>

08:03.250 --> 08:04.615
It seemed nice.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.319
I thought they'd take
good care of her,

08:07.454 --> 08:08.719
That she'd be safe.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.322
And was that the case?

08:10.457 --> 08:12.724
Uh, for the first
couple months.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.327
But then once she,
the accused,

08:15.462 --> 08:18.530
Um, became my mom's
continuing care assistant,

08:18.665 --> 08:22.000
It's like everything
just went to hell.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.003
I'd show up and mom would
be sitting in her own mess

08:25.005 --> 08:27.272
Or she'd need
an extra pillow

08:27.274 --> 08:29.407
And nina would look at
me like I had two heads.

08:29.443 --> 08:30.375
Hearsay.

08:30.444 --> 08:31.876
Judge kilcoyne:
<i> Move along, ms. Mayle.</i>

08:31.945 --> 08:34.078
Bethany:
<i> Did you speak to anyone</i>
<i> about your mom's care?</i>

08:34.114 --> 08:36.114
Eilidh:
<i> Not at first but</i>
<i> once she pushed me-</i>

08:36.183 --> 08:37.415
Objection, your honour.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.951
Bethany:
<i> It is our intention</i>
<i> to present evidence</i>

08:39.987 --> 08:41.419
Of a prior altercation

08:41.555 --> 08:43.487
Between ms. Macaskill
and the accused.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.522
Hmm.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.324
The witness can continue.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.993
She's lying.
I never touched her.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.161
I know. Nina, we're
gonna get our turn.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.163
Eilidh:
<i> Once that woman</i>
<i> pushed me,</i>

08:52.165 --> 08:53.365
<i> I complained to her boss</i>

08:53.367 --> 08:56.134
And the accused was taken
off my mother's care.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.570
So that was the end of
the defendant's interaction

08:58.639 --> 08:59.638
With your mother?

08:59.640 --> 09:02.373
No. As a result of covid,

09:02.442 --> 09:03.775
Oakland park was
short staffed

09:03.844 --> 09:06.978
So the accused was put
back on my mom's team.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.247
Bethany:
<i> How did your mother</i>
<i> respond to that?</i>

09:09.316 --> 09:10.382
Eilidh:
<i> I don't know.</i>

09:10.517 --> 09:12.650
Oakland park was
on lockdown.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.052
I didn't get to see her.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.290
My mother died
of covid.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.795
That woman gave
her covid-19-

09:23.930 --> 09:26.130
Objection! This is
highly prejudicial.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.266
Bethany:
<i> I'm as surprised</i>
<i> as ms. Diggs</i>

09:28.268 --> 09:29.834
To hear this
from my witness.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.870
However, we intend
to call evidence-

09:31.872 --> 09:34.339
And I will consider the
relevance of that evidence

09:34.341 --> 09:35.607
When it's put
before the court.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.142
Marcie:
<i> Your honour, the</i>
<i> complainant's allegations</i>

09:37.277 --> 09:38.809
Are entirely without basis.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.144
The jury needs
to be cautioned.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.313
She's a "hotspotter".

09:42.349 --> 09:43.281
<i> From preston.</i>

09:43.416 --> 09:44.716
<i> Even the</i>
<i> government said</i>

09:44.785 --> 09:46.884
<i> That that community was</i>
<i> a hotspot for covid.</i>

09:47.020 --> 09:47.918
Seriously, your honour.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.220
Judge kilcoyne:
<i> Ms. Macaskill,</i>

09:49.222 --> 09:51.055
<i> I need you to simply</i>
<i> answer the questions</i>

09:51.124 --> 09:53.024
Ms. Mayle asks of you.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.359
Don't editorialize,

09:54.428 --> 09:57.629
Don't present facts you
don't know as facts.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.631
<i> Ms. Diggs, I will take</i>
<i> your request for a caution</i>

09:59.766 --> 10:01.232
To the jury
under advisement.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.567
<i> Let's move this along.</i>

10:03.604 --> 10:05.303
Bethany:
<i> Let's go back</i>
<i> to the day</i>

10:05.305 --> 10:09.174
That the accused's vehicle
made contact with you.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.576
Did you have a
weapon in your hand

10:11.578 --> 10:13.111
<i> When you approached</i>
<i> the defendant?</i>

10:13.113 --> 10:14.445
No.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.848
Bethany:
<i> Were you planning to</i>
<i> physically harm the defendant?</i>

10:16.983 --> 10:18.383
I was upset,

10:18.452 --> 10:20.251
But I just wanted
to talk to her,

10:20.287 --> 10:22.253
To understand what
happened to my mother.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.754
I wasn't going
to hurt her.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.590
I have no
further questions.

10:26.592 --> 10:28.492
Judge kilcoyne:
<i> Ms. Diggs, cross.</i>

10:31.898 --> 10:33.264
Marcie:
<i> Your mother died.</i>

10:34.134 --> 10:35.467
This is someone
you idolized,

10:35.469 --> 10:37.402
Someone you loved.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.405
<i> And you blame nina francis</i>
<i> for her death?</i>

10:40.474 --> 10:42.440
Yes. Yes I do.

10:42.476 --> 10:45.043
Marcie:
<i> And, when you confronted</i>
<i> her at her home</i>

10:45.979 --> 10:47.511
You were angry.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.080
I wouldn't say angry, no.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.215
Marcie:
<i> No?</i>

10:50.217 --> 10:51.683
<i> Just thirty minutes before</i>

10:51.685 --> 10:55.153
<i> You were asking staff members</i>
<i> for my client's home address.</i>

10:55.222 --> 10:56.888
I wanted to talk
to her, yes. But-

10:56.957 --> 10:58.289
But you were angry?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.760
Nobody would give me
a straight answer.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.295
I just wanted to talk.

11:04.430 --> 11:05.530
Talk?

11:06.366 --> 11:12.270
(tense dramatic music)

11:12.405 --> 11:18.309
♪

11:18.378 --> 11:20.411
This doesn't look like
somebody who wants to talk.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.447
Bethany:
<i> Objection, we're not</i>
<i> here for ms. Diggs opinion.</i>

11:24.418 --> 11:25.950
I'm done with the witness.

11:26.019 --> 11:33.124
(tense dramatic music)

11:35.729 --> 11:36.994
Ust gets
to lie like that?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.197
The jury knows that
she's being dishonest.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.531
Do they marcie?

11:40.567 --> 11:42.467
<i> The media has half</i>
<i> the city believing</i>

11:42.536 --> 11:45.669
I'm the one responsible for
the outbreak at oakland park,

11:45.706 --> 11:46.871
Like I'm some serial killer.

11:46.873 --> 11:47.838
Nina!

11:47.874 --> 11:48.806
Nina:
<i> What, earl?</i>

11:48.875 --> 11:51.108
<i> Eilidh macaskill gets</i>
<i> to spew her lies</i>

11:51.144 --> 11:52.410
To anyone willing
to listen.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.745
What about us?

11:53.747 --> 11:55.213
<i> I can't get a job,</i>

11:55.215 --> 11:57.715
<i> No one will hire</i>
<i> you because of me.</i>

11:57.718 --> 11:59.283
And I'm sending the
girls to my brothers

11:59.352 --> 12:01.753
Just so they don't have
to be hassled every day.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.289
Nina, I need you to
maintain a positive attitude-

12:04.424 --> 12:06.090
Nina:
<i> You be positive, marcie.</i>

12:06.093 --> 12:09.427
All being positive has ever
gotten me was disappointment.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.028
These people have made it
so I can't hold my head up

12:11.098 --> 12:12.430
In my own community.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.466
<i> And who knows if I'll</i>
<i> ever be able to.</i>

12:18.972 --> 12:20.037
Iris:
<i> Hi ona.</i>

12:20.107 --> 12:21.873
Ona:
<i> Sorry iris, I was just</i>
<i> getting up to speed.</i>

12:22.008 --> 12:23.507
Uh, can you just give
us a moment please?

12:23.543 --> 12:24.708
Thanks.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.045
I didn't realize your
roomie was joining us.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.712
Oh, it's for our client.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.780
Yes, I was hoping

12:29.816 --> 12:31.249
That we could all work
together on this one.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.784
I like to think we're
always on the same side.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.553
Iris:
<i> I don't think that's</i>
<i> what doug meant.</i>

12:35.622 --> 12:37.054
I'm just messing
with your roomie.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.657
<i> So your client's aunt</i>

12:39.793 --> 12:41.826
Wants to be the guardian
of her unborn child?

12:41.961 --> 12:43.727
<i> What's the full name</i>
<i> of the mother-to-be?</i>

12:43.764 --> 12:45.729
Ivy lynn, no "e", maloney.

12:50.336 --> 12:51.636
Is there something wrong?

12:51.705 --> 12:54.939
Ona:
<i> No, no, it's just a birth</i>
<i> alert on ivy lynn's file.</i>

12:54.941 --> 12:57.108
Iris:
<i> Why is there a birth</i>
<i> alert on ivy's file?</i>

12:57.243 --> 13:00.177
Ona:
<i> I'd have to check with whoever</i>
<i> entered this into the system.</i>

13:01.281 --> 13:03.748
I mean, she's a minor
living in foster care

13:03.883 --> 13:05.883
With a juvenile history and
some learning exceptionalities.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.018
It could be that simple.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.553
Is it too late to
submit a safety plan?

13:08.688 --> 13:09.687
<i> To have her aunt appointed</i>

13:09.823 --> 13:11.355
<i> As the person who takes</i>
<i> custody of ivy's child</i>

13:11.424 --> 13:12.890
Instead of social services?

13:13.026 --> 13:14.458
I can try and
push one through.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.694
But she can also make her
application for guardianship

13:16.763 --> 13:18.162
Once the child is born.

13:18.231 --> 13:22.834
Iris:
<i> So you guys can just take</i>
<i> someone's baby for nothing?</i>

13:22.836 --> 13:24.235
Ona:
<i> Don't get it twisted, iris.</i>

13:24.271 --> 13:25.904
The-the whole basis
of the policy

13:26.039 --> 13:27.238
Is the best interest
of the child.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.506
Doug:
<i> Especially if the</i>
<i> mother of that child</i>

13:28.641 --> 13:29.573
Is indigenous or black.

13:29.609 --> 13:30.741
Hmm.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.977
Look, we can run this over
till the cows come home

13:32.979 --> 13:35.747
But it sounds like you
guys are on a clock.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.081
We are.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.783
We'll have the safety
plan in this afternoon.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.185
Ronnie does not want
her niece's child

13:41.188 --> 13:43.120
Spending a day
in the system.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.121
Thank you, ona.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.456
Yeah.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.625
<i> See ya.</i>
-Okay.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.265
Percy:
<i> Look, our legal aid</i>
<i> system is a mess,</i>

13:54.301 --> 13:56.734
Underfunded,
overworked, inefficient.

13:56.770 --> 14:00.338
It is supposed to be about
increasing access to justice

14:00.340 --> 14:03.408
And that shouldn't just
mean family and criminal.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.876
Come on, we do
more than that.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.277
I got you, I do,

14:06.313 --> 14:09.213
But I'm talking
civil litigation,

14:09.216 --> 14:11.216
<i> Wills and estates.</i>

14:11.351 --> 14:13.284
<i> If I'm elected new</i>
<i> chair of the hla board,</i>

14:13.419 --> 14:15.753
I will bring everyone
under one roof.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.256
We're wasting money with
leases across the city.

14:18.325 --> 14:23.427
Also, we only need one
"colleen" managing everyone

14:23.496 --> 14:27.765
Instead of being top heavy
with administrative salaries.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.501
And that savings will
go to fund more lawyers,

14:30.503 --> 14:32.570
Who will earn more than
just a living wage.

14:32.572 --> 14:33.971
Hive mind.

14:34.974 --> 14:36.374
What about negotiating
with government?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.508
You can't throw a
press conference

14:37.577 --> 14:38.976
Every time you
get in a spat.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.779
The house needs
to be cleaned.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.847
I can't do that if
I'm locked outside.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.719
Stand next to me, colleen.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.586
The two of us
working together

14:49.623 --> 14:54.058
Can usher in an entirely new
era in halifax legal aid.

14:56.162 --> 14:57.462
Let's keep talking.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.131
Tell me that's a yes.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.601
We investigated the incident

15:03.670 --> 15:04.736
Between nina and
ms. Macaskill,

15:04.871 --> 15:07.137
But as it was really
a she said/she said,

15:07.173 --> 15:09.607
We just decided moving nina
would be best for everyone.

15:09.676 --> 15:10.775
Bethany:
<i> But then covid hit</i>

15:10.910 --> 15:12.176
And the accused
ended up back

15:12.178 --> 15:13.611
On the late
mona macaskill's team?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.013
Yes.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.015
Bethany:
<i> When did mona macaskill</i>
<i> first exhibit symptoms</i>

15:17.150 --> 15:18.349
Of covid-19?

15:18.385 --> 15:20.417
Objection, relevance?

15:20.453 --> 15:22.219
Your honour,
the defence is arguing

15:22.255 --> 15:24.021
<i> That the complainant</i>
<i> attacked the accused</i>

15:24.090 --> 15:25.990
<i> Because she gave</i>
<i> her mother covid-19.</i>

15:26.059 --> 15:27.391
<i> They've made this relevant.</i>

15:28.561 --> 15:29.894
Go ahead, ms. Mayle.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.663
<i> Objection overruled.</i>

15:31.798 --> 15:33.397
Do you need me to
repeat the question?

15:33.433 --> 15:34.365
According to our records,

15:34.500 --> 15:36.968
She started exhibiting
symptoms April 21st.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.070
Bethany:
<i> And was the accused</i>
<i> part of her team?</i>

15:39.072 --> 15:42.273
Cathy:
<i> Yes, but she'd only just</i>
<i> returned to work days earlier.</i>

15:42.275 --> 15:43.708
<i> Nina was off</i>
<i> for two weeks.</i>

15:43.777 --> 15:45.176
<i> Vacation.</i>

15:45.178 --> 15:47.445
Bethany:
<i> She took a vacation at</i>
<i> the height of the pandemic?</i>

15:47.447 --> 15:49.246
Nina said her husband
had to go out of town

15:49.282 --> 15:50.648
For a family emergency.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.683
How long before the outbreak

15:51.818 --> 15:52.984
Had the accused
returned to work?

15:53.053 --> 15:54.252
Objection!

15:54.387 --> 15:57.187
Ms. Mayle is attempting to link
the outbreak to my client.

15:57.223 --> 16:00.124
I'm as dismayed as you are,
ms. Diggs.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.626
We're gonna take fifteen.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.128
<i> Sheriff, please</i>
<i> excuse the jury.</i>

16:04.263 --> 16:05.496
Sheriff:
<i> All rise.</i>

16:05.565 --> 16:07.031
I want a mistrial.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.866
Every time ms. Mayle
mentions covid

16:08.902 --> 16:10.167
In connection to my client,

16:10.302 --> 16:12.269
<i> The jury looks at her</i>
<i> like she's a murderer.</i>

16:12.305 --> 16:14.138
She's deliberately
feeding them information

16:14.140 --> 16:15.406
That's completely false.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.674
False?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.042
Every news outlet
in the country

16:18.078 --> 16:20.110
Has reported on the
outbreak at oakland park

16:20.146 --> 16:22.079
And several of them
mention your client

16:22.215 --> 16:23.614
As the source of
the outbreak.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.083
Ms. Mayle, I'm astonished
that you would engage

16:26.119 --> 16:27.418
In this line of questioning.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.620
<i> The outbreak at</i>
<i> oakland park is irrelevant.</i>

16:29.656 --> 16:31.255
<i> This is behaviour I</i>
<i> might expect to see</i>

16:31.257 --> 16:34.291
From a prosecutor
with zero experience.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.927
I want a mistrial,
your honour.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.228
I don't see how my client

16:37.297 --> 16:38.963
Can get a fair trial
going forward?

16:38.965 --> 16:41.032
You're not getting a
mistrial, ms. Diggs.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.100
The jury will be given
specific instructions

16:43.236 --> 16:45.269
Regarding the comments
made by ms. Mayle.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.704
<i> Bring the jury back.</i>

16:48.641 --> 16:51.776
They just get to do this
without even telling us?

16:51.778 --> 16:54.578
I'm so sick of these people
and their damn traps.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.247
They just get to
take my baby?

16:56.382 --> 16:57.682
We can get around this.

16:58.651 --> 16:59.550
Ronnie:
<i> You keep saying that.</i>

16:59.619 --> 17:01.586
But history keeps repeating,
don't it?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.821
(ivy crying)

17:03.857 --> 17:07.091
Ivy, ronnie, doug and I,

17:07.227 --> 17:09.193
We're gonna file
a safety plan

17:09.328 --> 17:11.595
Where ronnie is your
baby's guardian.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.801
<i> You get to choose who</i>
<i> takes care of your baby.</i>

17:16.870 --> 17:20.271
<i> Social services won't be</i>
<i> able to take your child.</i>

17:20.273 --> 17:22.073
Doug and I, we won't
let that happen.

17:23.676 --> 17:24.876
Doug:
<i> Iris is right.</i>

17:25.011 --> 17:26.277
We'll settle this.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.415
Dr. Jones,

17:31.484 --> 17:33.417
Can you state your
occupation for the record?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.153
I'm the chief physician
for oakland group,

17:35.288 --> 17:36.287
The owner of oakland park,

17:36.422 --> 17:37.555
The long term care home

17:37.557 --> 17:39.490
Where the defendant worked.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.592
Bethany:
<i> Can you describe</i>
<i> the covid protocols</i>

17:41.727 --> 17:44.262
That oakland group put in
place for their facilities?

17:44.264 --> 17:45.930
The covid protocols
I put in place, uh,

17:46.065 --> 17:47.831
Across the oakland
suite of homes

17:47.867 --> 17:50.400
Were based in the science
available at the time.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.837
<i> Ppe, facial shields, masks,</i>

17:52.839 --> 17:54.739
Increased ventilation,
distancing.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.375
Unfortunately, with the
staff coming and going,

17:57.510 --> 17:59.577
It proved impossible
to keep the "hotspotters"

17:59.712 --> 18:02.279
From bringing covid
into our facility.

18:02.348 --> 18:05.349
Can you clarify for the jury
what you mean by "hotspotter"?

18:05.351 --> 18:07.284
Ah, we have a lot of ccas,

18:07.286 --> 18:09.520
Janitorial staff,
cafeteria workers

18:09.556 --> 18:12.123
Who live in or have
connections to family

18:12.192 --> 18:14.959
<i> Living in covid hotspots</i>
<i> like the preston area,</i>

18:15.561 --> 18:16.928
"hotspotters".

18:17.063 --> 18:18.996
Bethany:
<i> So you believe that</i>
<i> one of the support staff</i>

18:19.065 --> 18:20.864
Is responsible
for the outbreak?

18:21.568 --> 18:22.566
Objection. Speculation.

18:23.569 --> 18:24.869
Bethany:
<i> I have no further questions.</i>

18:26.573 --> 18:27.672
Marcie:
<i> Let's talk about</i>
<i> this report</i>

18:27.807 --> 18:30.708
From oakland group's
human resources department.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.143
<i> Would you mind reading</i>

18:32.212 --> 18:34.178
<i> The highlighted</i>
<i> portion to the court?</i>

18:34.314 --> 18:37.481
Ah, it says 35% of
oakland group's employees

18:37.484 --> 18:39.216
Work across the
various facilities.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.484
Marcie:
<i> And how many employees</i>

18:40.487 --> 18:42.820
Work at the
north end halifax facility?

18:42.822 --> 18:43.954
Thirty, give or take.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.356
Marcie:
<i> And your</i>
<i> clayton park facility?</i>

18:46.325 --> 18:47.591
Thirty-six, I believe.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.193
And your bedford facility?

18:49.328 --> 18:50.761
Fifty-four.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.997
According to my quick
math that's 120 people.

18:54.033 --> 18:57.368
<i> And according to your own</i>
<i> human resources report,</i>

18:57.370 --> 18:59.303
<i> Thirty-five percent</i>
<i> of those people,</i>

18:59.372 --> 19:01.505
<i> So forty-two staff,</i>

19:01.574 --> 19:04.908
Are coming in and out of
the various facilities

19:04.944 --> 19:06.844
<i> In the midst</i>
<i> of a pandemic.</i>

19:08.114 --> 19:10.581
<i> And these numbers include</i>
<i> doctors and nurses?</i>

19:10.617 --> 19:12.049
Yes.

19:12.085 --> 19:14.785
Marcie:
<i> And do these doctors and</i>
<i> nurses work at other hospitals</i>

19:14.821 --> 19:16.921
Or other long term
care facilities?

19:16.990 --> 19:18.121
Some of them, yes.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.924
Marcie:
<i> So isn't it true</i>
<i> you have no idea</i>

19:21.060 --> 19:22.994
<i> What the source of the</i>
<i> outbreak might've been</i>

19:23.129 --> 19:24.461
At the north end facility?

19:24.497 --> 19:25.462
Objection, your honour.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.397
Judge kilcoyne:
<i> We'll continue.</i>

19:26.532 --> 19:27.598
Sit down, ms. Mayle.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.600
We acted in accordance
with the protocols

19:29.669 --> 19:31.134
Set by the government
at the time.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.703
Right, so the bare minimum.

19:33.972 --> 19:36.574
Are you currently being
sued by ms. Macaskill

19:36.709 --> 19:39.743
<i> For negligence in connection</i>
<i> with the death of her mother?</i>

19:39.779 --> 19:40.945
Bethany:
<i> Objection, your honour.</i>

19:40.947 --> 19:42.380
<i> Where is ms. Diggs</i>
<i> getting this from?</i>

19:42.515 --> 19:44.081
Did you insinuate
to ms. Macaskill

19:44.150 --> 19:45.916
During your
settlement discussions

19:45.985 --> 19:49.053
<i> That my client exposed</i>
<i> her mother to covid-19?</i>

19:49.055 --> 19:51.422
Your honour, orlando beam,

19:51.491 --> 19:53.023
Counsel for oakland park

19:53.059 --> 19:54.792
And I've instructed
dr. Jones

19:54.927 --> 19:57.361
<i> That conversations between</i>
<i> the group and ms. Macaskill</i>

19:57.363 --> 19:59.430

19:59.499 --> 20:01.432
I'm sorry,
who are you again?

20:01.501 --> 20:02.700
Orlando bloom?

20:02.702 --> 20:03.601
Orlando beam.

20:03.670 --> 20:04.769
Okay.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.672
Members of the jury,

20:07.674 --> 20:10.140
<i> I apologize for</i>
<i> the workout today,</i>

20:10.176 --> 20:14.345
But ms. Diggs, ms. Mayle,
mr. Beam and I

20:14.414 --> 20:16.213
Will need to have a
private conversation.

20:16.216 --> 20:21.051
(tense dramatic music)

20:21.120 --> 20:22.519
Orlando:
<i> I cannot allow dr. Jones</i>

20:22.521 --> 20:25.422
To answer questions related
to ongoing litigation.

20:25.424 --> 20:27.191
Your honour, if I'm not
allowed to conduct

20:27.260 --> 20:28.925
A full cross examination

20:28.962 --> 20:31.395
Of the evidence that dr. Jones
provided then I can't-

20:31.397 --> 20:33.831
Bethany:
<i> Ms. Diggs is attempting</i>
<i> to establish some proximity-</i>

20:33.900 --> 20:35.399
Marcie:
<i> I don't have to attempt.</i>

20:35.401 --> 20:38.669
Ms. Macaskill met with
dr. Jones and mr. Beam

20:38.804 --> 20:41.405
Immediately prior to confronting
my client at her home

20:41.407 --> 20:43.140
With her small children.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.409
<i> Something happened</i>
<i> at that meeting</i>

20:45.411 --> 20:47.344
That set her off in my
client's direction.

20:47.346 --> 20:48.913
Unfortunately,
that's information

20:49.048 --> 20:51.349
Dr. Jones will be
unable to share.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.817
Judge kilcoyne:

Solicitor-client privilege-

20:54.454 --> 20:55.886
Marcie:
<i> With respect your honour,</i>

20:55.888 --> 20:58.322
Mr. Beam has no standing
in this proceeding.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.493
Dr. Jones will not
answer any questions

21:02.628 --> 21:04.495
Related to the
ongoing litigation

21:04.497 --> 21:07.631
Between oakland park

<i> Enough!</i>

<i> Sheriff, bring the</i>

21:25.585 --> 21:26.917
I know a guy.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.853
You want one?
It's high protein.

21:28.988 --> 21:29.920
Oh, for sure.

21:29.956 --> 21:33.324

21:37.930 --> 21:39.196
Bad news.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.732
The safety plan you filed,
we can't approve it.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.400
Ronnie maloney has
been deemed unfit.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.401

They're not able to
approve the safety plan.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.279
<i> Ronnie's criminal record</i>
<i> disqualifies her.</i>

21:56.316 --> 21:57.414
Ona, we're talking
a couple of

21:57.483 --> 21:59.282
Resisting and public
disturbance convictions

21:59.319 --> 22:00.884
From over
twelve years ago,

22:00.920 --> 22:03.220
<i> Back when her partner was</i>
<i> struggling with alcohol.</i>

22:03.356 --> 22:05.156

this, right?

22:16.502 --> 22:17.968
It's a long shot.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.104
At this point, I'll probably
wait till the baby's born,

22:20.106 --> 22:23.641
But I got to try and
help these guys.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.642

what colleen said?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.644
She didn't approve
court time for this.

<i> the elder maloney,</i>

25:53.319 --> 25:55.486
<i> Will be able to apply</i>
<i> for guardianship</i>

25:55.488 --> 25:58.889
Thirty days following
the child's birth.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.525
<i> Mr. Paul,</i>
<i> it is galling.</i>

26:01.660 --> 26:03.093
<i> You knew this would</i>
<i> be the outcome</i>

26:03.129 --> 26:05.062
But still you decided
to waste the courts

26:05.131 --> 26:06.964
And mr. Biden's time.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.264
<i> We're adjourned.</i>

26:08.301 --> 26:11.668
(tense dramatic
music swells)

26:11.670 --> 26:14.271
Auntie, do they get
to take my son?

26:14.406 --> 26:15.639
Doug:
<i> We're gonna keep fighting.</i>

26:15.708 --> 26:16.941
Ronnie:
<i> You don't get it.</i>

26:17.076 --> 26:18.342
You grew up on reserve,

26:18.344 --> 26:21.011
Had the privilege
of community.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.746
Ivy didn't have that.

26:22.881 --> 26:24.682
<i> Her mother didn't.</i>
<i> I didn't.</i>

26:24.684 --> 26:26.016
This isn't over.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.685
We have options.

26:27.687 --> 26:28.952
This whole system's set up

26:29.021 --> 26:31.755
'cause of white people's
need to control us,

26:31.890 --> 26:33.223
Treat us like children.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.159
We're not children, doug.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.362
<i> We don't need</i>
<i> nor will I let</i>

26:38.364 --> 26:41.632
Their courts tell us who
gets to raise our kids.

26:41.701 --> 26:44.001
I'm done waiting for them
to give us a fair deal.

26:44.870 --> 26:46.270
What does that mean?

26:46.405 --> 26:48.372
You're a good man, wo'gumal.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.811
She was angry.

26:55.781 --> 26:56.580
Marcie:
<i> And how did you feel?</i>

26:57.683 --> 26:58.982
Nina:
<i> I was scared.</i>

26:59.885 --> 27:01.585
I just wanted to
get out of there.

27:02.355 --> 27:03.253
Did she have a,

27:03.389 --> 27:04.588
A weapon?

27:04.723 --> 27:07.291
Nina:
<i> I thought she had a</i>
<i> rock in her hand at first.</i>

27:07.426 --> 27:11.128
She nearly shattered the
driver's side window of my car.

27:11.197 --> 27:12.662
But now I know it
was just car keys.

27:12.698 --> 27:14.264
And then what happened?

27:14.266 --> 27:15.632
She started yelling.

27:17.469 --> 27:21.504
"you bitch.
You f-ing bitch.

27:21.540 --> 27:22.773
"my mother's dead
because of you,

27:22.908 --> 27:24.474
"I'm gonna kill you."

27:24.543 --> 27:25.776
Marcie:
<i> What did you do?</i>

27:25.911 --> 27:27.144
I opened my window.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.012
Just a little.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.349
I asked her to move.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.885
I told her I was taking
my girls to school.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.589
<i> They were so freaked out.</i>

27:41.127 --> 27:42.559
But she...

27:43.429 --> 27:45.795
She seemed
not in control.

27:45.831 --> 27:46.930
<i> I just needed to</i>
<i> get out of there</i>

27:46.932 --> 27:50.701
So I put my truck
in reverse.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.035
Did you intend
for your vehicle

27:52.104 --> 27:54.772
To make contact
with ms. Macaskill?

27:54.774 --> 27:55.906
Nina:
<i> No.</i>

27:55.908 --> 27:57.073
Marcie:
<i> Did you know that</i>
<i> you hit her?</i>

27:57.109 --> 27:58.275
Not until I looked
out the window

27:58.410 --> 28:00.043
And saw her lying
on the ground.

28:00.079 --> 28:02.012
And when you realized,
what did you do?

28:02.014 --> 28:03.413
I ran inside with my girls.

28:03.416 --> 28:04.648
I was scared.

28:04.783 --> 28:07.651
Marcie:
<i> Did you know why</i>
<i>eilidh macaskill came after you?</i>

28:07.653 --> 28:10.353
Nina:
<i> I didn't at the time,</i>
<i> but now I do.</i>

28:12.258 --> 28:14.858
She believes I gave
her mother covid.

28:14.927 --> 28:19.262
Marcie:
<i> So a great deal has been</i>
<i> made about your covid status</i>

28:19.331 --> 28:20.664
By ms. Mayle.

28:21.734 --> 28:24.835
Let's just go ahead
and clear that up.

28:24.837 --> 28:29.272
<i> You took off work from</i>
<i> April 5th until April 19th.</i>

28:29.308 --> 28:31.041
Can you tell
the court why?

28:31.176 --> 28:33.543
There was an outbreak
at my daughter's school.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.479
My husband was
on the road.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.751
They needed to self-isolate
so I stayed home with them.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.221
I asked cathy collins,
my supervisor,

28:44.223 --> 28:46.690
To use sick days,

28:46.692 --> 28:50.227
But the only way she'd
agree is if I took vacation.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.561
Marcie:
<i> So you did the</i>
<i> right thing,</i>

28:51.696 --> 28:54.030
You self-isolated with
your daughters for 14 days.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.431
The responsible thing.

28:56.502 --> 28:59.569
And did your daughters
end up having covid?

28:59.605 --> 29:01.505
No. Thank god.

29:01.507 --> 29:02.773
Marcie:
<i> How do you know?</i>

29:02.775 --> 29:04.307
Well ain't nobody got sick.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.777
Marcie:
<i> Have you ever had</i>
<i> a covid test?</i>

29:07.813 --> 29:09.112
Yes.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.381
Marcie:
<i> When was that test and</i>
<i> what were the results?</i>

29:11.383 --> 29:14.051
I took the test
on April 25th.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.518
<i> After I returned to work.</i>

29:18.223 --> 29:19.556
I was positive.

29:20.726 --> 29:22.859
Marcie:
<i> So let's review</i>
<i> the timeline.</i>

29:22.995 --> 29:25.596
<i> On April 20th</i>
<i> you returned to work</i>

29:25.731 --> 29:29.566
After self-isolating with
your daughters for 14 days.

29:29.568 --> 29:32.035
<i> And then on April 21st,</i>

29:32.037 --> 29:36.306
Mona macaskill started
exhibiting covid symptoms,

29:36.375 --> 29:38.141
<i> Less than 48 hours.</i>

29:43.883 --> 29:49.553
<i> Could you read the highlighted</i>
<i> section of exhibit d-28?</i>

29:49.555 --> 29:53.824
This is a cdc report regarding
the transmission of covid.

29:53.893 --> 29:57.628
Nina:
<i> "symptoms may appear</i>
<i> two to fourteen days</i>

29:57.630 --> 30:01.431
"after exposure
to the virus".

30:01.433 --> 30:02.432
Marcie:
<i> Thank you.</i>

30:02.434 --> 30:04.100
Less than two days.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.069
<i> And yet the</i>
<i> complainant believes</i>

30:06.071 --> 30:08.839
That you gave her
mother covid-19?

30:09.441 --> 30:10.574
No.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.444
I was infected by her.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.378
Eilidh:
<i> You're a liar!</i>

30:15.447 --> 30:16.513
(spectators gasp)
(tense dramatic music)

30:16.648 --> 30:17.714
She's lying!

30:17.783 --> 30:18.782
Tell them she's lying!

30:18.851 --> 30:20.717
She gave my mother covid!

30:20.786 --> 30:22.252
Tell them!

30:22.288 --> 30:23.854
Judge kilcoyne:
<i> Sheriff, get ms. Macaskill</i>
<i> out of my courtroom.</i>

30:23.856 --> 30:25.489
(tense dramatic music)

30:25.491 --> 30:26.690
She's lying!

30:26.825 --> 30:32.930
(tense dramatic music)

30:33.065 --> 30:34.598
I have no further questions.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.470
Did you tell your employer

30:40.472 --> 30:42.405
That you tested
positive for covid-19?

30:42.474 --> 30:43.439
No, I-

30:43.475 --> 30:44.508
Bethany:
<i> Weren't you concerned</i>

30:44.643 --> 30:47.144
<i> That you may have</i>
<i> infected your co-workers?</i>

30:47.279 --> 30:48.211
Other patients?

30:48.280 --> 30:49.345
I called in sick.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.481
Bethany:
<i> Right. You'd just</i>
<i> returned to work</i>

30:51.517 --> 30:53.016
After being off
for two weeks

30:53.151 --> 30:56.586
And then you tested
positive and you just fled.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.722
I didn't mean to,
I was scared.

30:58.857 --> 30:59.890
Bethany:
<i> Scared?</i>

30:59.959 --> 31:02.025
Nina:
<i> Covid was making</i>
<i> everybody crazy.</i>

31:04.830 --> 31:10.433
The numbers were
going up and up

31:10.469 --> 31:12.101
And people were dying.

31:16.842 --> 31:17.908
Telling someone
you had covid

31:17.977 --> 31:20.176
Was like walking
around with a mark on ya.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.681
You felt like you
did something wrong,

31:26.385 --> 31:27.817
Like you were bad,

31:29.121 --> 31:30.320
Some kind of criminal.

31:32.591 --> 31:33.924
I was ashamed.

31:34.059 --> 31:37.094
Bethany:
<i> Were you ashamed</i>
<i> or selfish?</i>

31:37.229 --> 31:39.196
You just cared about what
people would say about you.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.630
No.

31:40.699 --> 31:43.133
Bethany:
<i> You didn't care you'd exposed</i>
<i> your co-workers to covid.</i>

31:43.268 --> 31:45.202
You didn't care you may
have infected other patients

31:45.204 --> 31:46.169
At oakland park.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.137
I did.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.472
Bethany:
<i> Just like you</i>
<i> didn't care</i>

31:48.474 --> 31:50.974
When you hit ms. Macaskill
with your vehicle.

31:50.976 --> 31:53.810
I wasn't trying
to hurt her.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.946
I wasn't trying
to hurt anyone.

31:56.081 --> 31:58.047
Bethany:
<i> But you did,</i>
<i> didn't ya?</i>

31:58.083 --> 31:59.282
Objection!

31:59.351 --> 32:01.050
I'm done with the accused,
your honour.

32:01.086 --> 32:06.055
(tense dramatic music)

32:08.827 --> 32:11.227
Es that
man to make a sandwich,

32:11.229 --> 32:13.163
I could have been to
halifax and back.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.632
I wish you and dad would
stop acting so foolish.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.300
So now you're
taking his side?

32:17.369 --> 32:18.302
Mom, no sides,

32:18.437 --> 32:20.437
We just don't want our
parents divorcing.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.639
Ain't about what you want,
is it?

32:22.774 --> 32:24.841
Come on, there ain't
no talking to you.

32:24.877 --> 32:27.377
Whatever you do,
just be nice.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.445
(phone ringing)

32:29.447 --> 32:32.049
Emily:
<i> Oh that's avery.</i>

32:32.051 --> 32:33.182
Avery! Avery.

32:33.218 --> 32:35.551
Oh, smile on her
face says it all.

32:38.724 --> 32:41.124
Hey, what time
is it there?

32:41.259 --> 32:42.926
Um, well it's late,
but, uh,

32:44.262 --> 32:45.995
I wanted you to
see this view.

32:47.032 --> 32:49.299
<i> Definitely makes</i>
<i> being sober easier.</i>

32:49.368 --> 32:50.267
Marcie:
<i> Wow.</i>

32:50.402 --> 32:51.535
(giggling)

32:51.537 --> 32:54.738
Emily and mom are here,
I should, uh, I should go.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.473
Avery:
<i> They're teasing you,</i>
<i> aren't they?</i>

32:56.542 --> 32:57.807
Yes.

32:57.876 --> 32:59.275
(avery laughs)

32:59.277 --> 33:00.143
I'll see you soon.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.577
Avery:
<i> You be good.</i>

33:02.448 --> 33:03.813
(in funny voice)
no, "I love you"?

33:05.083 --> 33:07.951
Te quiero mucho, papi.
-<i> Oh my god.</i>

33:08.086 --> 33:10.220
So, when's your
man coming back?

33:10.222 --> 33:11.154
Marcie:
<i> What man?</i>

33:11.289 --> 33:12.689
I don't have a man,
we're just friends.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.958
Mmm.
-Ohhh, okay.

33:15.093 --> 33:16.025
Hello friend!

33:16.061 --> 33:19.196
(giggling)

33:19.331 --> 33:21.631
But ethically doesn't
it bother you?

33:21.633 --> 33:24.567
I mean, you show up to the
hospital and take someone's kid.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.035
Ona:
<i> I don't see</i>
<i> it that way.</i>

33:27.106 --> 33:29.705
Whenever I've had to
enforce a birth alert,

33:29.742 --> 33:31.842
I make sure the mom
understands what's happening

33:31.977 --> 33:33.242
And she's got time to
make a safety plan.

33:33.278 --> 33:34.845
I don't want these
kids in the system.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.379
Yeah, but even that.

33:36.381 --> 33:38.015
Why is it the
luck of the draw?

33:38.150 --> 33:40.250
And we still don't even know
why there's a birth alert

33:40.319 --> 33:41.485
On ivy's file.

33:41.487 --> 33:42.552
The system needs
to change,

33:42.554 --> 33:43.820
You'll get no
argument from me.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.189
<i> Now, tell me,</i>

33:47.259 --> 33:50.193
What is going on
with you and that

33:50.328 --> 33:52.261
Gentle giant of a man?

33:53.365 --> 33:54.197
<i> What, I'd love to have</i>
<i> those big old arms</i>

33:54.266 --> 33:55.865
Wrapped around
me for a night.

33:56.502 --> 33:57.667
It's not like that.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.137
Doug is...

34:02.074 --> 34:03.339
<i> You know how I grew up.</i>

34:03.475 --> 34:04.640
We moved around a lot.

34:04.676 --> 34:05.942
It was never stable.

34:05.944 --> 34:08.879
I never felt safe.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.647
And I feel safe with doug.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.318
And you're not
sleeping with him?

34:15.320 --> 34:17.753
(choking)
(ona laughs)

34:17.790 --> 34:19.122
No!

34:19.124 --> 34:20.190
He's not my type.

34:20.325 --> 34:21.658
He's right up my alley.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.026
Good for you.
-Mmhmm.

34:23.028 --> 34:24.027
<i> ♪ stop breaking the law</i>

34:24.162 --> 34:27.296
<i> ♪ bring it back</i>
<i> to you all ♪</i>

34:28.167 --> 34:31.134
(boat horn honking)

34:32.971 --> 34:34.604
Doug:
<i> I think we need to have</i>
<i> all our ducks in a row</i>

34:34.673 --> 34:35.771
<i> For the permanent</i>
<i> care hearing</i>

34:35.808 --> 34:36.773
Once ivy's son is born.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.108
Colleen:
<i> Judge dewey's</i>
<i> clerk called.</i>

34:38.243 --> 34:39.376
Colleen.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.644
I specifically told you
I didn't want you in court

34:40.779 --> 34:41.645
On this file.

34:41.780 --> 34:42.579
Listen I'm-

34:42.714 --> 34:43.646
Colleen:
<i> You're testing me, doug.</i>

34:43.682 --> 34:45.381
Pam tested me.
Do I have to fire you too?

34:45.451 --> 34:46.883
The case got complicated.

34:46.952 --> 34:48.885
I'm not just gonna
abandon this family.

34:49.020 --> 34:50.453
It's always complicated, doug.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.055
That's my point.

34:52.124 --> 34:53.456
Every case, every file.

34:53.525 --> 34:54.991
<i> When is it ever simple?</i>

34:54.993 --> 34:56.927
Everybody needs more
and we don't have it.

34:57.062 --> 34:58.995
So we're just letting
people fall off the table?

34:58.997 --> 35:00.130
Is that what we're doing?

35:00.132 --> 35:01.664
Oh, you drive me, doug.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.268
Look, tell your client
to find another lawyer.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.145
Ronnie's voicemail:
<i> Hey, it's ronnie.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

35:16.181 --> 35:17.280
<i> I'll holla back.</i>

35:17.415 --> 35:20.283
Ronnie, it's doug paul.
Call me back.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.688
We are leaving behind

35:24.690 --> 35:27.957
The very folks this system
was intended to protect.

35:28.026 --> 35:30.794
The system has been
crippled by special interests.

35:30.929 --> 35:33.096
<i> The only consideration</i>
<i> should be need.</i>

35:33.231 --> 35:35.198
Our clients are stigmatized

35:35.333 --> 35:38.768
By the fact that our range
of services are so limited.

35:38.770 --> 35:42.672
Employment law, wills,
civil litigation,

35:42.708 --> 35:44.440
<i> Why not provide</i>
<i> these services?</i>

35:44.476 --> 35:46.009
Why are we picking
and choosing?

35:46.011 --> 35:47.978
We are not a
private law firm.

35:48.113 --> 35:49.712
We need to
abolish docketing.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.114
And I would suggest
a wage freeze

35:51.249 --> 35:53.383
Until we can complete
an internal review.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.685
We need to hold the
government's feet to the fire.

35:55.687 --> 35:59.556
Legal aid has been underfunded
for the last twenty years.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.992
<i> It is time for the government</i>
<i> to recommit and reinvest</i>

36:03.028 --> 36:04.060
In legal aid.

36:04.096 --> 36:05.861
We do not have a
future without it.

36:05.898 --> 36:09.199
Without these steps, we do
not have a viable path forward.

36:13.372 --> 36:16.139
Marcie:
<i> Ms. Macaskill, why</i>
<i> were you at oakland park</i>

36:16.208 --> 36:18.341
<i> On the day of the incident</i>
<i> between you and my client?</i>

36:18.410 --> 36:20.944
I had a meeting
scheduled with dr. Jones.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.846
And what was your state of mind
coming out of that meeting?

36:22.981 --> 36:24.213
Orlando:
<i> Your honour,</i>

36:24.249 --> 36:26.215
I must remind the court the
meeting was privileged.

36:26.251 --> 36:27.417
Marcie:
<i> Your honour,</i>

36:27.552 --> 36:29.552
<i> I'm not asking about the</i>
<i> subject matter of the meeting.</i>

36:29.621 --> 36:32.455
Judge kilcoyne:
<i> Mr. Beam, your privilege</i>
<i> is with dr. Jones,</i>

36:32.457 --> 36:34.357
<i> Who's an employee</i>
<i> of oakland group.</i>

36:34.426 --> 36:36.892
<i> Ms. Macaskill can answer</i>
<i> ms. Digg's questions.</i>

36:38.496 --> 36:39.962
Marcie:
<i> What was your state of mind</i>
<i> coming out of that meeting?</i>

36:39.964 --> 36:41.297
I was angry.

36:42.201 --> 36:43.366
I had asked
about the people

36:43.402 --> 36:44.968
Who'd been in contact
with my mother

36:45.037 --> 36:47.169
And they kept giving
me the run around.

36:47.206 --> 36:48.170
<i> I asked about the accused,</i>

36:48.207 --> 36:50.373
<i> They said she'd quit</i>
<i> out of the blue.</i>

36:50.375 --> 36:52.242
<i> So I asked why.</i>

36:52.311 --> 36:54.477
<i> They said they didn't know.</i>

36:54.613 --> 36:57.380
I asked if she tested
positive for covid.

36:59.084 --> 37:00.984
They couldn't
even look at me,

37:01.119 --> 37:03.052
Went on about privacy.

37:04.456 --> 37:07.257
My mother was dead and they
were still protecting her.

37:07.259 --> 37:10.727
And so you confronted
my client at her home?

37:10.796 --> 37:14.764
Yeah, I wanted her
to take responsibility.

37:14.833 --> 37:18.268
Marcie:
<i> And you were angry,</i>
<i> riled up.</i>

37:18.270 --> 37:20.236
Eilidh:
<i> I'd just seen my</i>
<i> mother that Sunday.</i>

37:24.610 --> 37:26.009
She was gone that fast.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.476
I didn't even get
to hold her.

37:30.148 --> 37:31.681
And no one's responsible.

37:32.484 --> 37:33.783
No one's accountable.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.153
<i> Someone gave</i>
<i> my mom covid.</i>

37:39.224 --> 37:40.623
<i> No one will take</i>
<i> responsibility.</i>

37:40.758 --> 37:42.124
Not them, not nina.

37:44.263 --> 37:45.561
Someone did this.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.099
Someone killed my mother.

37:53.171 --> 37:55.304
Someone is responsible.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.242
Marcie:
<i> Yes, eilidh.</i>

38:01.847 --> 38:04.714
<i> But it's pretty clear</i>
<i> given yesterday's testimony</i>

38:04.849 --> 38:09.151
That there is no way my
client gave your mother covid.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.454
That's not true.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.029
(crying) you're right.

38:20.865 --> 38:22.631
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.235
<i> You're right.</i>

38:31.209 --> 38:32.508
I'm so sorry, nina.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.083
Bethany:
<i> Your honour,</i>

38:41.119 --> 38:43.953
In light of
ms. Macaskill's testimony,

38:43.989 --> 38:46.222
The crown is willing to
enter a stay of proceedings

38:46.358 --> 38:48.124
Against the defendant.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.526
What does that mean?

38:49.528 --> 38:51.294
Judge kilcoyne:
<i> Ms. Diggs, I take it</i>
<i> you don't object?</i>

38:52.230 --> 38:56.566
(tense dramatic music)

38:56.568 --> 38:58.568
I strenuously object,
your honour.

38:58.570 --> 39:02.805
(tense music swells)

39:05.777 --> 39:08.678
<i> Been maligned in the media.</i>

39:08.747 --> 39:11.714
Her life's been harmed
perhaps irreparably

39:11.849 --> 39:13.749
<i> By this court proceeding.</i>

39:13.785 --> 39:16.286
<i> Ms. Mayle's offer</i>
<i> to stay the charge</i>

39:16.421 --> 39:19.322
<i> Does nothing to begin</i>
<i> repairing the damage</i>

39:19.391 --> 39:20.790
To my client's reputation.

39:20.925 --> 39:22.558
Is there an ask,
ms. Diggs?

39:22.594 --> 39:23.860
Marcie:
<i> The public understands</i>

39:23.929 --> 39:27.530
The meaning of a not guilty
verdict, your honour.

39:27.599 --> 39:30.400
I'd ask the crown
to direct the jury

39:30.402 --> 39:34.337
To enter a not guilty
verdict against my client.

39:34.472 --> 39:35.538
Ms. Mayle?

39:36.608 --> 39:38.141
Your honour, the
crown does not oppose

39:38.143 --> 39:40.677
Ms. Digg's request on
behalf of the accused.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.446
Marcie:
<i> We thank the crown for</i>
<i> your position on that</i>

39:43.482 --> 39:44.814
<i> And we concur.</i>

39:44.949 --> 39:46.783
Judge kilcoyne:
<i> While the court takes</i>
<i> no opinion on this,</i>

39:46.785 --> 39:49.151
But given the
unanimity of counsel,

39:49.187 --> 39:52.087
We would ask the jury to
return with that verdict.

39:52.089 --> 39:57.493
(gentle music)

39:57.529 --> 40:01.363
We find the defendant,
nina francis, not guilty.

40:01.365 --> 40:02.632
(crowd sighing)

40:02.701 --> 40:05.468
(gentle music)

40:05.470 --> 40:06.969
Marcie:
<i> This is over.</i>

40:07.038 --> 40:08.104
Judge kilcoyne:
<i> Members of the jury,</i>

40:08.239 --> 40:11.374
<i> We thank you for your</i>
<i> service in this matter.</i>

40:11.376 --> 40:15.178
Nina, the court wishes nothing
but rest and restoration

40:15.180 --> 40:17.146
<i> For you and your</i>
<i> family moving forward.</i>

40:17.883 --> 40:18.982
We did it.

40:19.117 --> 40:20.483
Judge kilcoyne:
<i> Court is adjourned.</i>

40:32.597 --> 40:35.798
Hey, what are
you doing here?

40:35.867 --> 40:38.234
I, uh, thought I'd get
a little head start

40:38.303 --> 40:39.402
Setting up an office.

40:39.537 --> 40:40.803
An office here?

40:40.806 --> 40:42.338
Yeah.

40:42.340 --> 40:44.340

knew colleen.

40:44.342 --> 40:45.608

40:45.677 --> 40:47.142

40:47.179 --> 40:48.678
More than you want to.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.346
I like to get my
hands dirty.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.281
Okay.

40:52.350 --> 40:53.416
Ah, first things first,

40:53.551 --> 40:54.751
We need to talk about
getting the lawyers

40:54.753 --> 40:56.352

weekly billings.

40:56.354 --> 40:58.688

way beyond capacity.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.356
<i> Ooh, easy now.</i>

41:00.425 --> 41:02.892
There is a method
to the madness.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.962
We can agree that the system
is on the verge of breaking.

41:06.031 --> 41:09.432
<i> Well no one will pay</i>
<i> attention until we break it.</i>
