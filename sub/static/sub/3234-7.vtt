00:28.456 --> 00:29.857
Mmm.

04:36.738 --> 04:39.039
Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.

04:39.073 --> 04:41.975
All right, you can call
my lawyer, Saul Goodman.

04:42.010 --> 04:44.077
Talk to my lawyer, all right?

04:44.112 --> 04:46.113
Hey, you hear me.
I got nothing to say.

04:46.147 --> 04:47.648
I told you.
You can call my-

04:49.617 --> 04:51.718
Ah, Christ! God!

04:51.753 --> 04:52.986
You had my cell phone number!

04:53.021 --> 04:54.688
You had my wife's name!

04:54.722 --> 04:55.756
How'd you do it?

04:55.790 --> 04:58.592
Huh? Who you working with?

06:20.642 --> 06:23.610
If you're, uh, ready to talk,

06:23.645 --> 06:25.545
they want to get a statement.

06:26.681 --> 06:29.016
Your side
of what happened here.

06:30.485 --> 06:33.320
Or we can hold him off
till another time.

06:37.659 --> 06:40.327
Maybe you'll want
to talk to a lawyer.

06:50.471 --> 06:51.772
There it is.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.143
Yo, Adrian.

06:56.177 --> 06:58.578
Rocky called.
He wants his face back.

07:00.181 --> 07:02.115
Come on.
I got to cheer you up.

07:02.150 --> 07:05.252
You see that? That's your
Get Out of Jail Free card.

07:05.286 --> 07:07.487
You understand Get Out of
Jail Free card, right?

07:07.522 --> 07:09.957
I mean, just blink once
if you're following.

07:11.059 --> 07:12.426
The D.A.'s worst nightmare

07:12.460 --> 07:15.228
is that face out in public.

07:15.263 --> 07:16.930
They're going to have
to steer a wide berth

07:16.965 --> 07:18.532
of young Master Pinkman

07:18.566 --> 07:20.534
for fear of the P.R.
poop storm

07:20.568 --> 07:22.035
that will rain down on them

07:22.070 --> 07:23.537
if this story ever gets out.

07:23.571 --> 07:25.339
I mean, this- this beating?

07:25.373 --> 07:27.574
Best thing for you.

07:27.608 --> 07:29.176
You're home free.

07:30.345 --> 07:31.678
Good, right?

07:32.680 --> 07:33.780
Right.

07:53.835 --> 07:56.003
Oh, my God.

07:56.037 --> 07:58.572
You're now officially
the cute one of the group.

07:58.606 --> 08:01.274
Paul, meet Ringo.
Ringo, Paul.

08:05.213 --> 08:07.080
This is- I-

08:07.115 --> 08:11.618
Jesse, I'm-
I am so sorry for this.

08:11.652 --> 08:13.553
This should not have happened.

08:15.456 --> 08:17.657
But it did.

08:17.692 --> 08:20.027
No thanks to you.

08:23.731 --> 08:26.033
But the plan did work.

08:26.067 --> 08:28.035
We would have been
locked up right now

08:28.069 --> 08:29.536
if we didn't lure him away.

08:29.570 --> 08:30.737
But this-

08:30.772 --> 08:33.340
this- I just-

08:33.374 --> 08:35.142
I never saw this coming.

08:40.214 --> 08:42.916
So...

08:42.950 --> 08:45.185
What, uh...

08:45.219 --> 08:46.887
W- what happens now?

08:46.921 --> 08:49.056
What happens now?

08:49.090 --> 08:53.226
I'll tell you what happens now.

08:53.261 --> 08:57.898
Yo scumbag brother-in-law
is finished,

08:57.932 --> 09:00.100
done.

09:00.134 --> 09:01.568
You understand?

09:01.602 --> 09:06.640
I will own him
when this is over.

09:06.674 --> 09:09.276
Every cent he earns,

09:09.310 --> 09:13.013
every cent his wife earns,

09:13.047 --> 09:15.782
is mine.

09:15.817 --> 09:18.085
Anyplace he goes,

09:18.119 --> 09:20.053
anywhere he turns,

09:20.088 --> 09:22.556
I'm going to be there,

09:22.590 --> 09:25.325
grabbing my share.

09:25.359 --> 09:30.197
He'll be scrubbing toilets
in Tijuana for pennies,

09:30.231 --> 09:32.933
and I'll be standing over him

09:32.967 --> 09:35.836
to get my cut.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.871
He'll see me when he wakes up
in the morning

09:37.905 --> 09:40.373
and when he crawls to sleep

09:40.408 --> 09:42.809
in whatever rat hole's
left for him

09:42.844 --> 09:46.746
after I shred his house down,

09:46.781 --> 09:51.084
I will haunt his crusty ass

09:51.119 --> 09:53.286
forever

09:53.321 --> 09:55.889
until the day

09:55.923 --> 09:59.292
he sticks a gun up his mouth

09:59.327 --> 10:01.661
and pulls the trigger

10:01.696 --> 10:04.264
just to get me out of his head.

10:05.633 --> 10:11.204
That's what happens next.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.715
Uh, my advice-

10:21.749 --> 10:24.951
that's probably not
a good strategy.

10:24.986 --> 10:27.387
I mean, they're scared
of you right now.

10:27.421 --> 10:29.022
They want nothing
to do with you.

10:29.056 --> 10:30.891
But if you hit them,

10:30.925 --> 10:33.960
they're forced
to hit back hard.

10:33.995 --> 10:36.229
I mean, they will
turn over every rock

10:36.264 --> 10:38.031
hither, thither, and yon

10:38.065 --> 10:40.300
until someone spills
the beans on you

10:40.334 --> 10:42.135
and anyone associated with you,

10:42.170 --> 10:43.670
uh, present company included.

10:43.704 --> 10:46.907
Yeah, I think what Saul is
saying makes a lot of sense.

10:46.941 --> 10:51.411
Jesse, move on with your life.

10:51.445 --> 10:53.480
Leave it behind, all of it.

10:53.514 --> 10:55.715
Nothing changes.

10:55.750 --> 10:58.885
Once I walk out of here,

10:58.920 --> 11:03.390
I get myself a new RV
and go start cooking again.

11:04.625 --> 11:08.161
How exactly do you think

11:08.196 --> 11:10.030
you're going to get
away with that?

11:10.064 --> 11:11.565
They will catch you.

11:11.599 --> 11:12.966
So what?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
What?

11:14.035 --> 11:16.236
I have a Get Out of Jail
Free card.

11:16.270 --> 11:20.874
Hey, I may have overstated
the, uh, power of your face.

11:20.908 --> 11:23.543
Not this.

11:23.578 --> 11:27.781
If the cops catch me...

11:27.815 --> 11:30.717
I give them
what they want the most.

11:35.590 --> 11:37.224
You.

11:41.429 --> 11:44.364
They nab me,

11:44.398 --> 11:46.566
I make a deal

11:46.601 --> 11:51.671
to give up the great Heisenberg

11:51.706 --> 11:55.909
and his million-dollar
drug ring.

11:59.714 --> 12:05.352
You're my free pass, bitch.

12:10.224 --> 12:11.424
You're so sure.

12:11.459 --> 12:13.426
Look, if he didn't
give up my name

12:13.461 --> 12:15.495
while Hank was beating him
senseless,

12:15.529 --> 12:17.097
he's never going to talk.

12:17.131 --> 12:19.766
What do you think that was
in there, a bluff?

12:19.800 --> 12:21.601
He wants your brother-in-law.

12:21.636 --> 12:23.403
And there's going to be
a parade of lawyers

12:23.437 --> 12:25.839
creaming their Underoos
for a case like that.

12:25.873 --> 12:27.207
I mean, I'd take it myself

12:27.241 --> 12:29.576
if it wouldn't cause
so much collateral damage.

12:29.610 --> 12:31.211
And him cooking again.

12:31.245 --> 12:34.047
Hey, when, not if,
he gets caught,

12:34.081 --> 12:35.482
and he's facing 20 years,

12:35.516 --> 12:36.883
what'll he do then?

12:36.917 --> 12:40.120
Believe me, there's
no honor among thieves.

12:40.154 --> 12:43.390
Except for us, of course.

12:44.592 --> 12:46.026
No, he'll-

12:46.060 --> 12:47.260
he'll come around.

12:49.463 --> 12:50.964
And if he doesn't,

12:50.998 --> 12:53.400
there may come a time
to talk options.

12:53.434 --> 12:55.135
Options?

13:09.391 --> 13:10.758
I'm convinced that Mr. Pinkman
was involved

13:10.793 --> 13:12.593
in the manufacture
and distribution

13:12.628 --> 13:13.995
of phenyl-2
methamphetamine,

13:14.029 --> 13:16.297
specifically what we're
calling the blue meth.

13:16.931 --> 13:19.233
I tracked him to a scrap yard

13:19.267 --> 13:22.036
where he stored
an early '80s camper,

13:22.070 --> 13:24.905
an RV.

13:24.939 --> 13:26.940
While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle,

13:26.975 --> 13:30.010
which I believed to be
a rolling meth lab,

13:30.045 --> 13:32.680
I received a telephone call

13:32.714 --> 13:37.918
telling me my wife Marie had
been injured in an accident.

13:37.952 --> 13:40.087
Upon hearing the news,

13:40.121 --> 13:41.822
I left Mr. Pinkman
and his vehicle

13:41.856 --> 13:43.991
to tend to my wife.

13:44.025 --> 13:45.926
After arriving at the hospital,

13:45.960 --> 13:48.095
I learned the emergency
call was a hoax.

13:48.129 --> 13:51.665
My wife, fortunately,
was unharmed.

13:54.636 --> 13:56.837
So I immediately went
back to the salvage yard,

13:56.871 --> 13:58.539
but the RV was gone.

13:58.573 --> 14:01.141
Most likely destroyed on site.

14:01.176 --> 14:02.509
And it was at this point

14:02.544 --> 14:04.545
that you drove to the home
of Jesse Pinkman?

14:16.891 --> 14:18.292
I think we're done here.

14:18.326 --> 14:20.994
Agent Schrader
needs to get home,

14:21.029 --> 14:22.229
get some rest.

14:22.263 --> 14:23.363
That's fine.

14:23.398 --> 14:25.299
But just to confirm,

14:25.333 --> 14:27.000
you're taking the Fifth here?

14:27.035 --> 14:28.869
Yeah. That's correct.

14:28.903 --> 14:33.774
Okay. Well, we just want
to GI you all a heads up.

14:33.808 --> 14:37.444
Mr. Pinkman is pressing
charges in this matter.

14:37.479 --> 14:39.413
He's given a detailed version

14:39.447 --> 14:41.849
of events as he sees them.

14:41.883 --> 14:43.317
The word of a meth head.

14:43.351 --> 14:45.152
We know all about his history.

14:45.186 --> 14:46.220
We're well aware,

14:46.254 --> 14:49.690
but toxicology on Pinkman-

14:49.724 --> 14:52.292
his blood is clean,
he's not using.

14:52.327 --> 14:55.729
The kid is even refusing his
doctor-ordered pain meds,

14:55.764 --> 14:57.564
as far as we can tell.

15:00.335 --> 15:01.702
So, um...

15:03.705 --> 15:06.240
...where do we go from here?

15:06.274 --> 15:08.208
A couple of gentlemen
from OPR will come down,

15:08.243 --> 15:10.444
probably tomorrow morning.

15:10.478 --> 15:12.746
Janice will give us
an exact time on that.

15:12.781 --> 15:16.283
And you men will be
continuing your investigation,

15:16.317 --> 15:18.352
so...

15:18.386 --> 15:19.787
Thanks for your time.

15:19.821 --> 15:21.889
Right. We just-

15:21.923 --> 15:23.524
We need one more thing.

15:23.558 --> 15:28.395
Photo of Agent Schrader's
hands, for the record.

15:29.531 --> 15:31.532
Yes, of course.

15:31.566 --> 15:34.001
Bandage off, if you would.

15:39.374 --> 15:41.208
Um, on the table is fine.

15:42.610 --> 15:44.645
Flat on the table is fine.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.814
It's all going to work out.

17:27.848 --> 17:30.817
You've been too good to them
for too many years.

17:30.852 --> 17:32.185
I hope it goes without saying

17:32.220 --> 17:35.522
that we're not talking
to anybody about this, okay?

17:37.892 --> 17:39.059
Okay.

17:41.329 --> 17:43.564
Marie, who?

18:19.234 --> 18:20.334
Hi.

18:20.368 --> 18:22.770
Do you have a minute?

18:22.804 --> 18:24.438
Sure.

18:39.254 --> 18:41.321
I guess crime does pay.

18:46.094 --> 18:49.129
I don't suppose you just
came by to insult me.

18:51.533 --> 18:54.968
No. We need to talk.

18:55.003 --> 18:57.371
You heard about Hank?

18:57.405 --> 19:01.375
About what happened
with this, um, Jesse Pinkman?

19:01.409 --> 19:03.544
Yes, I know.

19:03.578 --> 19:06.046
Whatever Hank
was investigating,

19:06.081 --> 19:10.250
him trying to find an RV,

19:10.285 --> 19:12.286
is there any danger

19:12.320 --> 19:14.755
that could lead back to you?

19:14.789 --> 19:19.026
No. Why would it?

19:22.897 --> 19:24.698
Is this why you're here?

19:26.568 --> 19:28.202
I'm here to talk about Hank.

19:28.236 --> 19:29.403
Mm-hmm.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.806
You know what's
going to happen to him

19:32.841 --> 19:35.375
if this Pinkman
presses charges?

19:37.779 --> 19:39.780
Hank could lose everything.

19:43.218 --> 19:46.820
I thought maybe, um...

19:46.855 --> 19:49.757
There's a way
you could help him.

19:49.791 --> 19:51.592
How?

19:51.626 --> 19:54.695
Contact Pinkman.

19:54.729 --> 19:56.630
Get him to drop the charges.

19:56.664 --> 19:59.466
Look, Skyler, I don't know
what kind of relationship

19:59.501 --> 20:01.802
you picture me having
with this person.

20:01.836 --> 20:02.836
I'm not asking.

20:02.871 --> 20:04.538
He was- He's-

20:04.572 --> 20:06.073
He's not my friend.

20:06.107 --> 20:07.407
I mean,
it's not as if we-

20:07.442 --> 20:08.675
I'm-
... were even close.

20:08.710 --> 20:10.944
I'm not asking.

20:10.979 --> 20:13.514
But there must be
something you could say.

20:14.616 --> 20:17.551
Isn't it even worth a try?

20:17.585 --> 20:19.686
Hank is your family.

20:23.224 --> 20:24.925
Not currently.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.160
What?

20:26.194 --> 20:28.796
I said not currently.

20:30.632 --> 20:33.200
I'm late. I have to go.

21:06.267 --> 21:08.300
Hello. I was starting
to get worried.

21:12.006 --> 21:13.340
Car trouble.

21:14.843 --> 21:16.610
Oh. That's a bummer.

21:17.979 --> 21:19.313
You should call me next time.

21:19.347 --> 21:20.681
I'll pick you up.

21:20.715 --> 21:21.748
Uh-huh.

21:23.918 --> 21:26.854
No, uh, no sandals today?

21:28.256 --> 21:29.756
I just thought-

21:30.825 --> 21:32.826
a bit more professional.

21:34.062 --> 21:35.596
Well,

21:35.630 --> 21:36.997
everything is on track.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.668
We got our distillate.
Just waiting to-

21:41.703 --> 21:43.704
Let's get our trays ready.

21:43.738 --> 21:45.572
Clean, no moisture.

21:45.607 --> 21:46.406
Done.

21:49.878 --> 21:52.846
Is our, uh...

21:52.881 --> 21:54.147
Our solvent filtered?

21:54.182 --> 21:56.316
I thought you might ask that.

21:56.351 --> 21:57.618
Done.

21:59.988 --> 22:03.257
That's good.

22:03.291 --> 22:06.193
Hand in glove.
That's what we strive for.

22:08.529 --> 22:09.897
Yo5 know,

22:09.931 --> 22:12.966
this might be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

22:44.899 --> 22:46.967
So, you the gentlemen?

22:50.171 --> 22:52.673
Lucky you boys called me.
I got a load to pick up.

22:52.707 --> 22:54.541
I'm taking the 40
straight through to Memphis.

22:54.575 --> 22:56.076
I could hammer it out
in about 15,

22:56.110 --> 22:57.411
but there's a girl down there

22:57.445 --> 22:59.513
named Lainie or Lolly
or something. Maybe Fran.

22:59.547 --> 23:00.948
She's got one
of these fetish things-

23:00.982 --> 23:02.115
wants to get peed on.

23:02.150 --> 23:03.750
I was hoping
to see her tonight,

23:05.787 --> 23:07.788
so I want to wrap it up
here ASAP

23:07.822 --> 23:09.489
because traffic
can be a wild card,

23:09.524 --> 23:10.691
you know,
rubbernecking and such.

23:10.725 --> 23:11.992
The surprising thing is

23:12.026 --> 23:13.460
women who like to get peed on

23:13.494 --> 23:15.195
always tend to be
from the warmer climates.

23:15.229 --> 23:17.030
You'd think the ones
in the colder zones

23:17.065 --> 23:18.131
would be more inclined.

23:18.166 --> 23:19.733
Maybe it's a shock
to the system

23:19.767 --> 23:21.101
if the body's
not properly acclimated,

23:21.135 --> 23:24.037
but, you know, I leave that
for smart minds than me.

23:24.072 --> 23:27.341
Science is a mystery.

23:27.375 --> 23:29.042
Well, take a gander.

23:29.077 --> 23:30.677
Prices are negotiable.

23:30.712 --> 23:32.279
Buying in bulk
gets you a discount.

23:32.313 --> 23:33.914
I'm running a special
on these little honeys.

23:35.850 --> 23:37.784
JHPs. Hollow-point bullets,

23:37.819 --> 23:39.453
known by the natives
as Black Death.

23:39.487 --> 23:41.088
Check it out.
Huh. You like that?

23:41.122 --> 23:42.689
So sweet, you want to lick it.

23:42.724 --> 23:44.891
Nickel-plated brass casing,
Lubalox coat for panache.

23:44.926 --> 23:47.527
Sucker has six razor claws
that expand upon impact.

23:47.562 --> 23:48.729
Whew.

23:48.763 --> 23:50.130
Shred your mama's head
like a cabbage.

23:50.164 --> 23:51.698
Hmm.

23:51.733 --> 23:53.100
Keep it. On the house?

23:53.134 --> 23:54.601
Anyhow, I've been
windjamming long enough.

23:54.635 --> 23:56.703
Why don't you boys tell me
what you're looking for?

23:56.738 --> 23:57.938
What can I do you for?

23:57.972 --> 23:59.406
Vests.

23:59.440 --> 24:02.309
Vests? Hell, yeah,
we got vests.

24:02.343 --> 24:04.378
Right here.

24:08.216 --> 24:09.683
Sleek, comfortable,

24:09.717 --> 24:11.818
thermally bonded
non-interwoven Kevlar fiber.

24:11.853 --> 24:14.287
Stop a bullet like a soft wank
against a Quaker girl.

24:14.322 --> 24:15.655
Just ain't getting through.

24:15.690 --> 24:17.024
And lightweight?

24:17.058 --> 24:18.225
Damn, so lightweight,

24:18.259 --> 24:19.559
you'll forget
you're wearing it.

24:21.129 --> 24:22.562
They work?

24:22.597 --> 24:25.198
Sure as shit, they do.

24:25.233 --> 24:27.134
I don't leave home without it.

24:31.773 --> 24:32.739
Ohh!

24:34.909 --> 24:36.877
What the hell?

24:38.312 --> 24:42.349
You broke my freakin' rib,
you maniac son of a bitch.

25:13.381 --> 25:15.082
You're welcome!

25:32.632 --> 25:33.599
Gale.

25:33.633 --> 25:36.401
What temperature
did you set here?

25:36.436 --> 25:38.337
There? That's...

25:38.371 --> 25:41.206
Station Five- 75 C.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.778
I said 85.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.279
8-5.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.947
No.

25:48.982 --> 25:52.184
I, uh-
I wrote it down.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.952
You said 75.

25:53.987 --> 25:55.220
I- I wrote it.

25:55.255 --> 25:56.355
Well, then you wrote it wrong.

25:56.389 --> 25:59.591
That's not what I said.
I said 85.

25:59.626 --> 26:03.028
It's always been 85-

26:03.063 --> 26:06.465
not 75, not 95.

26:06.499 --> 26:07.933
85.

26:07.967 --> 26:11.336
This is chemistry.
Degrees matter.

26:15.341 --> 26:16.709
I'm sorry.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.711
I'm very sorry.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.180
Great. You're sorry.

26:21.214 --> 26:24.683
Meanwhile, you've just brewed
50 gallons of useless sludge.

26:24.718 --> 26:25.951
Congratulations.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.520
Just dump it. Dump it all.

26:28.555 --> 26:30.155
This batch is ruined.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.290
You look nice.

27:07.327 --> 27:09.561
I look like a TV weatherman.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.132
You want a coffee?

27:16.302 --> 27:17.636
Nah.

27:20.173 --> 27:21.473
I squeezed some orange juice.

27:21.508 --> 27:24.409
You want to glass
of orange juice?

27:24.444 --> 27:25.778
I'm all right.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.187
What are you
going to tell them?

27:40.026 --> 27:41.994
Here's what you're
going to tell them.

27:42.028 --> 27:45.430
He attacked you.

27:45.465 --> 27:46.799
He attacked me?

27:46.833 --> 27:49.334
He- He swung at you
with something.

27:49.369 --> 27:51.103
He-
He-

27:51.137 --> 27:53.172
Swung at me...
attacked you with a pipe.

27:53.206 --> 27:54.473
With a pipe?

27:56.342 --> 27:57.543
It happened fast.

27:57.577 --> 27:58.911
He resisted arrest,

27:58.945 --> 28:01.079
and muscle memory kicked in,

28:01.114 --> 28:03.348
and you had to disarm him.

28:03.383 --> 28:05.150
Muscle memory.

28:05.185 --> 28:07.553
Yes.
It happens all the time.

28:07.587 --> 28:10.856
Years of training, and your body
acted faster than your brain.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.858
You had no choice
but to hit him.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.460
You had to fight back.
Marie, Marie, Marie.

28:16.930 --> 28:17.930
No.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.533
I'm not going to go
in there and lie.

28:21.568 --> 28:24.369
It's some lowlife degenerate

28:24.404 --> 28:27.206
versus you...

28:27.240 --> 28:29.341
Doing the job
you're supposed to.

28:31.311 --> 28:33.278
Why should you be
the one who pays

28:33.313 --> 28:35.547
for doing the right thing?

28:35.582 --> 28:38.050
Oh, baby,
it wasn't the right thing.

28:39.686 --> 28:41.386
It's not what the job is.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.890
I'm supposed to be
better than that.

28:46.292 --> 28:49.061
And you made one mistake.

28:50.897 --> 28:53.565
No, it wasn't one mistake.
I've been-

28:56.502 --> 28:57.870
I've been...

29:00.273 --> 29:03.508
...unraveling,
you know?

29:07.747 --> 29:09.815
I don't sleep at night anymore.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.685
I freeze.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.420
I freeze up.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.459
My chest gets all tight.
I- I can't breathe.

29:22.729 --> 29:23.795
Just-

29:23.830 --> 29:26.064
I panic.

29:29.469 --> 29:32.638
Ever since
that Salamanca thing.

29:32.672 --> 29:34.873
I mean, Tuco Salamanca.

29:34.908 --> 29:38.310
If ever a scumbag deserved
a bullet between the eyes.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.384
It changed me.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.658
And I can't seem to control it.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.263
I tried to fight it.

30:01.034 --> 30:04.436
But then El Paso.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.106
And it's just gotten worse.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.845
What I did to Pinkman...

30:16.916 --> 30:18.717
...that's not who
I'm supposed to be.

30:18.751 --> 30:20.018
That's not me.

30:23.723 --> 30:24.990
All this-

30:26.926 --> 30:28.894
everything
that's happened, I-

30:30.663 --> 30:31.964
I swear to God, Marie,

30:31.998 --> 30:36.802
I think the universe is
trying to tell me something,

30:36.836 --> 30:40.105
and I'm finally...

30:40.139 --> 30:41.840
Ready to listen.

30:50.249 --> 30:53.051
I'm just not the man
I thought I was.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.757
I think I'm done as a cop.

31:10.136 --> 31:12.371
Now, this is-
is not an easy decision,

31:12.405 --> 31:15.674
but it is one
that I have to make.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.376
I'm sorry.

31:17.410 --> 31:19.678
This whole...

31:19.712 --> 31:21.413
Gale situation-

31:21.447 --> 31:24.716
he's- he's just
not working out.

31:27.954 --> 31:30.122
Yes. Now.

31:30.156 --> 31:33.392
It- It may sound unorthodox,

31:33.426 --> 31:38.864
but I think our first-
best option...

31:41.100 --> 31:43.168
Is Jesse Pinkman.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.306
Hello?

31:53.513 --> 31:54.613
It-

31:55.648 --> 31:56.882
No, look. Th-There's-

31:56.916 --> 32:00.786
There's a- a shorthand
that exists between us-

32:00.820 --> 32:02.554
experience together

32:02.588 --> 32:05.290
at a level that, quite frankly,

32:05.324 --> 32:07.959
I- I'm just never going
to reach with Gale.

32:12.732 --> 32:15.967
Look, Mr. Fring,

32:16.002 --> 32:18.270
when I accepted your offer,

32:18.304 --> 32:21.640
I was told the lab is mine.

32:21.674 --> 32:23.975
And I know best how to run it.

32:29.549 --> 32:30.782
Thank you.

32:31.984 --> 32:35.821
Thank you.
Yes, I will. I will.

32:35.855 --> 32:38.190
Okay. Good-bye.

32:45.865 --> 32:47.632
Listen, something's come up.

32:48.868 --> 32:51.703
And, uh, I think
it's a good opportunity.

32:54.507 --> 32:57.476
There's been a job opening.

32:57.510 --> 32:59.244
I need a new lab assistant.

33:01.581 --> 33:05.083
I already did my time.

33:05.118 --> 33:07.519
Why don't you just go
get yourself a monkey?

33:08.855 --> 33:12.858
I don't want a monkey.
I want you.

33:12.892 --> 33:15.293
Oh, gee, thanks.

33:15.328 --> 33:17.929
Well, not interested.

33:17.964 --> 33:21.766
I got my own thing going on.

33:21.801 --> 33:26.171
Nice try saving your
a- head brother-in-law.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.878
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.

33:32.912 --> 33:34.513
There's more.

33:36.249 --> 33:39.417
It's more than an assistant.

33:39.452 --> 33:41.219
Partners.

33:42.722 --> 33:44.523
We'll be partners again.

33:44.557 --> 33:48.160
Split everything 50-50,
just like before.

33:49.929 --> 33:54.432
$1.5 million each.

34:00.973 --> 34:02.507
No.

34:08.313 --> 34:10.348
I don't think you heard-

34:10.382 --> 34:14.518
I've heard you fine.

34:14.554 --> 34:16.487
I said no.

34:19.859 --> 34:22.494
Let me understand this.

34:22.527 --> 34:26.831
You're turning down
$11/2 million.

34:26.866 --> 34:30.467
I am not turning down
the money.

34:30.503 --> 34:33.737
I am turning down you.

34:33.773 --> 34:35.974
You get it?

34:36.007 --> 34:39.643
I want nothing to do with you.

34:41.581 --> 34:43.949
Ever since I met you,

34:43.983 --> 34:48.420
everything
I have ever cared about

34:48.454 --> 34:51.089
is gone...

34:51.123 --> 34:54.592
Ruined, turned to shit,

34:54.627 --> 34:56.995
dead, ever since I hooked up

34:57.029 --> 35:01.032
with the great Heisenberg.

35:01.067 --> 35:04.903
I have never been more alone.

35:04.937 --> 35:07.872
I have nothing!

35:07.907 --> 35:10.375
No one!

35:10.409 --> 35:13.211
All right?
It's all gone!

35:13.246 --> 35:15.547
Get it?

35:15.581 --> 35:18.516
No. No, no.

35:18.551 --> 35:20.819
Why-

35:20.853 --> 35:24.789
Why would you get it?

35:24.824 --> 35:26.258
What do you even care

35:26.292 --> 35:31.129
as long as you get
what you want?

35:31.163 --> 35:32.664
Right?

35:32.698 --> 35:38.236
You don't give a shit
about me.

35:39.705 --> 35:42.641
You said I was no good.

35:42.675 --> 35:45.343
I'm nothing!

35:45.378 --> 35:48.747
Why would you want me?
Huh?

35:48.781 --> 35:54.419
You said my meth
is inferior, right?

35:54.453 --> 35:55.954
Right?

35:55.988 --> 36:00.225
Hey! You said my cook
was garbage!

36:00.259 --> 36:02.627
Hey, screw you, man!

36:10.303 --> 36:13.338
Your meth is good, Jesse.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.373
As good as mine.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.333
Yeah.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.003
<i>50-50.</i>

37:20.673 --> 37:22.340
Yes. 50-50.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.412
Okay.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.581
Partners.

37:35.121 --> 37:37.055
Good.

38:24.317 --> 38:26.985
This is the statement
you want to give?

38:27.420 --> 38:29.888
Yes, sir.

38:29.922 --> 38:32.124
Hank, you don't
have to do this.

38:32.158 --> 38:33.425
No, I-

38:34.861 --> 38:36.295
I do.

38:37.430 --> 38:38.530
I'm good.

38:42.468 --> 38:43.902
So we understand

38:43.937 --> 38:47.139
if we write it up like that,
you'll sign it.

38:49.075 --> 38:50.776
That's the way it happened.

38:52.045 --> 38:54.046
I accept the consequences.

38:59.919 --> 39:03.088
In the light of these facts...

39:03.122 --> 39:06.191
As of this moment,
you're suspended without pay.

39:06.226 --> 39:09.995
I have to ask you to hand over
your badge and your gun.

39:10.029 --> 39:11.163
Yes, sir.

39:41.694 --> 39:42.895
Schrader.

39:43.930 --> 39:45.297
Hold up.

39:45.331 --> 39:46.431
Yes, sir?

39:47.767 --> 39:49.501
I just want
to tell you something.

39:49.535 --> 39:51.770
And to be clear,
you didn't hear it from me.

39:51.804 --> 39:53.839
I don't want you
to get your hopes up,

39:53.873 --> 39:55.107
but the word in the pipeline is

39:55.141 --> 39:57.042
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

39:58.778 --> 39:59.745
Why not?

39:59.779 --> 40:02.547
Who the hell knows?

40:02.582 --> 40:05.117
Maybe you have
a guardian angel.

40:27.573 --> 40:28.907
It went fine.

40:30.310 --> 40:32.077
Well, fine means what-

40:32.111 --> 40:33.645
means what it means. Yeah.

40:33.680 --> 40:36.214
I'll, uh...

40:36.249 --> 40:39.184
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

40:40.720 --> 40:42.454
Yeah. It's-

40:42.488 --> 40:44.690
Yeah, it's just-

40:44.724 --> 40:47.025
I don't know, baby.
I just think-

40:47.060 --> 40:48.760
I think we may be okay.

40:48.795 --> 40:50.062
Yeah.

40:50.096 --> 40:52.631
Okay. I love you, too.

41:13.720 --> 41:14.820
Schrader.

41:14.854 --> 41:16.021
<i>I need you</i>

41:16.055 --> 41:17.389
<i>to listen
very carefully.</i>

41:17.423 --> 41:19.257
<i>Two men are coming
to kill you.</i>

41:19.292 --> 41:20.759
Come again?

41:20.793 --> 41:23.128
<i>They're approaching
your car.</i>

41:23.162 --> 41:25.097
<i>You have one minute.</i>

41:25.131 --> 41:27.866
I don't get the gag,
jerk off. Who is this?

41:27.900 --> 41:30.102
<i>They're coming.</i>

41:30.136 --> 41:31.370
Hello.

41:46.753 --> 41:47.919
Hey, Li-

41:50.023 --> 41:51.356
Hey, Gomie, this is Hank.

41:51.391 --> 41:53.091
I don't know what that
call's supposed to be,

41:53.126 --> 41:55.360
but it's dumb
even by your standards,

41:55.395 --> 41:56.795
so call me when you get this.

43:17.844 --> 43:19.578
Aah!
Aah!

43:32.525 --> 43:33.725
Aah!

45:09.288 --> 45:10.388
No.
