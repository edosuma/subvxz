00:03.577 --> 00:05.510
You know who lives here?

00:05.512 --> 00:07.312
Jake McCoy.

00:07.314 --> 00:08.479
- Baseball player.
- Still no.

00:09.816 --> 00:11.649
Me and my old partner
broke up a party here once.

00:11.651 --> 00:13.685
It was nuts. It was
like "Boogie Nights."

00:13.687 --> 00:15.019
I walked off with an
autographed ball, though, so,

00:15.021 --> 00:16.154
that was pretty cool.

00:16.155 --> 00:17.622
- Here we go.
- Do you hear that?

00:17.624 --> 00:18.823
Stay where you are, sir.

00:18.825 --> 00:20.825
How is anyone supposed
to sleep with that racket?

00:20.827 --> 00:22.994
Try going back home and
closing your windows.

00:22.996 --> 00:25.096
Try that.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

00:45.552 --> 00:47.418
Burgess. Blood.

00:48.955 --> 00:50.555
2113 Squad, we're on scene.

00:50.557 --> 00:52.190
Roll another car this way.
We'll advise in a minute.

00:52.192 --> 00:54.292
Go.

00:56.630 --> 00:59.063
Chicago PD!

01:06.439 --> 01:08.973
On three... One, two, three, move.

01:10.176 --> 01:12.076
- See that?
- Yeah.

01:13.713 --> 01:15.813
Split.

01:21.688 --> 01:23.154
Body.

01:24.124 --> 01:26.224
Got it.

01:39.172 --> 01:41.039
She was the only one in the house.

01:41.041 --> 01:42.407
We found a purse; All it had was

01:42.409 --> 01:45.109
$64 in cash, make-up, two condoms,

01:45.111 --> 01:46.411
and dime bag of heroin.

01:46.413 --> 01:49.314
So we have no idea who she is.

01:49.316 --> 01:51.382
Well, she's somebody's daughter.

01:51.384 --> 01:52.650
No alarm.

01:52.652 --> 01:55.787
No sign of forced entry
and no sign of Jake McCoy.

01:55.789 --> 01:58.056
Just some smashed up
and missing memorabilia.

01:58.058 --> 01:59.324
Hey, boss?

01:59.326 --> 02:01.693
Hey, McCoy's cell keeps
going to voice-mail.

02:01.695 --> 02:03.094
Found his lawyer's business card.

02:03.096 --> 02:05.296
She said he's on his way
back from a hunting trip.

02:05.298 --> 02:07.565
Why would you tell your lawyer
you were going on vacation

02:07.567 --> 02:08.966
for the weekend?

02:08.967 --> 02:10.967
Let's get a pinging order,
find out where he's at.

02:10.970 --> 02:12.403
- All right.
- Yo.

02:12.405 --> 02:14.439
We got a lot of press
showing up outside, Sarge.

02:14.441 --> 02:15.907
All right, comb the neighborhood.

02:15.909 --> 02:17.709
Check for security cameras.

02:17.711 --> 02:19.877
I want you to find witnesses
before the press does,

02:19.879 --> 02:20.878
you understand?

02:20.880 --> 02:22.313
Copy that.

02:22.315 --> 02:24.415
Hey, Sarge.

02:27.887 --> 02:29.287
You know Jake McCoy?

02:29.289 --> 02:31.022
Yeah, why?

02:32.792 --> 02:34.025
How well?

02:35.528 --> 02:37.595
Pretty well. He's a good guy.

02:39.165 --> 02:42.266
This gonna be a conflict for you?

02:42.268 --> 02:45.203
I don't see stripes on
your shoulders, Antonio.

02:45.205 --> 02:48.840
OK, so I'll ask. Is
it gonna be a conflict?

02:48.842 --> 02:51.642
No.

03:09.367 --> 03:11.068
How did you know?

03:11.070 --> 03:13.971
Know what?

03:13.973 --> 03:15.739
Daisies.

03:15.741 --> 03:18.075
They're my favorite.

03:18.077 --> 03:20.978
I didn't send those.

03:20.980 --> 03:23.046
Come on.

03:25.584 --> 03:27.618
"Erin."

03:29.888 --> 03:32.222
And the card's blank.

03:32.224 --> 03:33.890
You're messing with me right now.

03:33.892 --> 03:35.692
I swear to God, I didn't send these.

03:39.498 --> 03:41.832
Damn sure gonna find
out who did, though.

03:46.855 --> 03:49.589
All right, Maya Collins. Age 16.

03:49.591 --> 03:52.626
I ran her prints; She's got
one prior for possession.

03:52.628 --> 03:54.161
She's originally from Hailey, Idaho.

03:54.163 --> 03:55.395
No known address.

03:55.397 --> 03:57.564
Her case agent said that
she fell through the cracks

03:57.566 --> 03:58.899
in the juvie system.

03:59.101 --> 04:02.002
Cause of death is blunt
force trauma to the head.

04:02.004 --> 04:04.104
There was blood on the
edge of the coffee table.

04:04.106 --> 04:05.906
Looks like she went into it backwards.

04:05.908 --> 04:09.342
M.E. put the death somewhere
between 12:00 and 2:00 A.M.

04:09.344 --> 04:11.211
The neighbor that called
and made the complaint

04:11.213 --> 04:13.713
said he heard a girl scream at 12:30.

04:13.715 --> 04:15.916
Said that wasn't out of the
ordinary at Jake's house.

04:15.918 --> 04:17.216
What are we looking at here?

04:17.219 --> 04:19.185
I mean, does Jake McCoy
have a history of violence?

04:19.187 --> 04:22.289
Well, I met Jake about
10 years or so ago.

04:22.291 --> 04:24.190
You know, before I came
to Intelligence, I mean.

04:24.192 --> 04:26.693
Since then, my contact
was pretty sporadic.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.342
Now, do I think he's a killer?

04:29.344 --> 04:30.410
Not the Jake that I know.

04:30.412 --> 04:31.778
Well, there is the robbery angle.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.613
I mean, the trophy case was cleared out,

04:33.615 --> 04:34.681
the house was tossed,

04:34.683 --> 04:36.749
and the girl, whatever
she was doing there,

04:36.751 --> 04:38.451
she might've just
been collateral damage.

04:38.453 --> 04:41.020
Looks live vice was looking
at McCoy for serving alcohol

04:41.022 --> 04:43.656
to underage girls in his house.

04:43.858 --> 04:45.291
Was McCoy into underage girls?

04:45.293 --> 04:47.226
You'd have to ask him, Antonio.

04:47.228 --> 04:50.997
You know, Jake's got a gofer,
a guy named Freddy Mays.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.532
He'd run a guest list.

04:52.534 --> 04:55.068
All right, let's see if
the robbery matches the M.O.

04:55.070 --> 04:56.169
of any current crews.

04:56.171 --> 04:59.372
Alert local pawn shops, anybody
moving McCoy memorabilia.

04:59.374 --> 05:01.307
Crack off an investigative alert.

05:01.309 --> 05:04.811
Contact CPD at Midway,
O'Hare, train stations.

05:04.813 --> 05:06.713
Tell our guys to keep
an eye out for McCoy.

05:06.715 --> 05:08.881
- I'll talk to Freddy.
- I'll go with.

05:08.883 --> 05:10.083
Good.

05:13.726 --> 05:16.760
Figured I'd be seeing you, Al.

05:16.762 --> 05:18.162
This thing about the girl, man.

05:18.164 --> 05:20.531
- That's crazy.
- So what happened, Freddy?

05:20.533 --> 05:22.666
What, you're not living
in the guest house?

05:22.668 --> 05:25.302
I guess you didn't hear.

05:25.304 --> 05:27.037
No, man, Jake fired me.

05:27.039 --> 05:29.406
Yeah, after he drove his
Ferrari into that lamppost

05:29.408 --> 05:31.509
six months ago, Jake said he saw God.

05:31.511 --> 05:33.077
And Jake would know what he'd look like.

05:33.079 --> 05:35.112
What Ferrari? What lamppost?

05:38.351 --> 05:39.583
Jake got into a car wreck.

05:39.585 --> 05:42.686
Yeah, crawled out alive; He
decided he wanted to turn the page.

05:42.688 --> 05:46.290
I thought the page we were on
was pretty damn good, but...

05:46.292 --> 05:48.425
Whatever, man, I'm over it.

05:48.427 --> 05:50.161
You know her?

05:50.163 --> 05:51.529
Just from the news.

05:51.531 --> 05:52.830
Aw, come on, Freddy.

05:52.832 --> 05:54.331
You used to bring all the girls around.

05:54.333 --> 05:55.566
Definitely not her.

05:55.568 --> 05:59.003
You still have access to McCoy's house?

05:59.005 --> 06:00.871
Now I'm starting to feel
like your partner here

06:00.873 --> 06:02.540
thinks that I had
something to do with this.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.608
Did you?

06:04.610 --> 06:06.343
No.

06:06.345 --> 06:08.746
Hey, can I, talk to you real quick?

06:16.722 --> 06:18.189
Hey, you're...

06:18.191 --> 06:20.257
You're gonna look after him, right?

06:22.395 --> 06:24.028
You leaving anything out, Freddy?

06:24.030 --> 06:26.096
No. No, I'm just saying.

06:26.098 --> 06:29.099
I mean, we can count on you, right?

06:29.101 --> 06:31.268
Keep your phone on.

06:38.126 --> 06:42.329
Kim Burgess and Mike
Sorensen, you two met?

06:42.331 --> 06:43.396
Great.

06:43.398 --> 06:45.298
I need you to get over to Manny's Deli.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.435
Call just came in, woman tried
to swipe a brisket sandwich.

06:48.437 --> 06:50.437
We caught a high-profile
murder last night

06:50.439 --> 06:52.772
and now you have us
chasing stolen sandwiches?

06:52.774 --> 06:54.507
You didn't "catch" anything.

06:54.509 --> 06:56.509
You answered a call.

06:56.511 --> 06:59.079
And if, after a proper
investigation of this crime,

06:59.081 --> 07:00.780
you were to bring back a pastrami on rye

07:00.782 --> 07:02.916
with honey mustard, I'd
leave that to your discretion.

07:02.918 --> 07:05.986
So this is a sandwich run?

07:05.988 --> 07:07.821
After the offender grabbed the brisket,

07:07.823 --> 07:10.090
she pushed a waitress over a table.

07:10.092 --> 07:11.825
It's an actual thing, so get on it.

07:11.827 --> 07:14.694
Honey mustard. Roger that.

07:21.243 --> 07:24.143
That car accident McCoy
was in six months ago.

07:24.145 --> 07:25.878
According to the patrolman's report,

07:25.880 --> 07:27.113
alcohol appeared to be present,

07:27.115 --> 07:29.282
but didn't play a part in the accident.

07:29.284 --> 07:31.951
No DUI was ever administered.

07:31.953 --> 07:34.187
All right, so what're
you fishing for here?

07:34.189 --> 07:35.388
The truth.

07:35.390 --> 07:37.724
Same as you, or am I wrong on that?

07:39.394 --> 07:42.528
I got a call from a beat
officer out of the 28th district.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.230
Told me he didn't want
to talk on the phone,

07:44.232 --> 07:48.568
but a friend was
involved in an accident.

07:48.570 --> 07:49.736
When I got there, the officer hands me

07:49.738 --> 07:51.804
one of my business cards.

07:51.806 --> 07:53.106
The one that I had given to Jake.

07:53.108 --> 07:55.375
Look, Al, I know you like to play things

07:55.377 --> 07:56.676
close to the vest, but...

07:56.678 --> 07:59.679
What? I mean, it's just
a friend helping a friend.

07:59.681 --> 08:02.915
What, you never looked the
other way at your social club?

08:06.755 --> 08:08.288
Olinsky.

08:08.290 --> 08:10.290
Where are you, Jake?

08:21.218 --> 08:23.251
We're in position.

08:30.894 --> 08:32.327
I'm good, Jake.

08:32.328 --> 08:33.962
- I'm buying.
- I'm good, I'm good.

08:33.964 --> 08:35.996
I'm OK.

08:43.472 --> 08:44.939
This is where it all started for me.

08:46.009 --> 08:49.310
Canary Ville Kings.

08:49.312 --> 08:51.479
Everything was so simple.

08:51.481 --> 08:53.314
It was still a game.

08:56.119 --> 08:59.654
Jake, you said you needed my help.

08:59.656 --> 09:01.289
You know, I'm here.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.191
Talk to me.

09:03.193 --> 09:05.493
Everybody thinks I killed that girl.

09:07.164 --> 09:09.030
Did you?

09:12.202 --> 09:14.235
No.

09:14.237 --> 09:15.403
All right.

09:15.405 --> 09:17.572
Then what happened?

09:30.754 --> 09:33.488
- Gun.
- Move in.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.925
It doesn't matter what happened.

09:36.927 --> 09:38.860
- They're gonna crucify me.
- Just take it easy.

09:38.862 --> 09:41.062
I'm gonna help you through
this thing, all right?

09:41.064 --> 09:42.730
That's what I said to Maya.

09:42.732 --> 09:44.132
- Look what happened.
- Hey, hey, hey.

09:44.134 --> 09:45.333
Drop it!

09:48.839 --> 09:50.905
I didn't do it, Al.

09:50.907 --> 09:52.474
I didn't do it.

10:09.712 --> 10:11.946
- Get him in, interview one.
- I'll talk to Al.

10:11.948 --> 10:14.949
If it's not Al, I want my lawyer here.

10:14.951 --> 10:16.551
Let's go.

10:18.555 --> 10:20.588
OK, who is doing the interview?

10:22.025 --> 10:24.025
Me and Hank.

10:24.027 --> 10:26.794
Wait, what?

10:26.796 --> 10:27.862
Do you have a problem?

10:27.864 --> 10:29.964
Not with you.

10:29.966 --> 10:31.933
You're right here, brother.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.134
I do have a problem, though,

10:33.136 --> 10:35.036
with you running point on this, given...

10:35.038 --> 10:36.204
The givens.

10:36.206 --> 10:38.273
I don't have a personal
conflict on this case.

10:38.275 --> 10:39.540
OK, then drop back.

10:39.542 --> 10:40.708
Let one of us handle it.

10:40.710 --> 10:42.744
Look, Al has a relationship.

10:42.746 --> 10:46.281
Relationships count for
something in an interview.

10:46.283 --> 10:47.548
Until they don't,

10:47.550 --> 10:49.918
which is something I'll determine.

10:56.072 --> 11:00.641
Tell us about Maya.

11:00.643 --> 11:02.376
I met her, like, two months ago

11:02.378 --> 11:04.245
at the Boys and Girls Club.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.881
I do a lot of volunteer
work there; Al knows.

11:06.883 --> 11:10.418
And she said she was trapped.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.619
Scared.

11:11.621 --> 11:14.722
Yeah, what was she scared of?

11:14.724 --> 11:18.126
Her pimp.

11:18.128 --> 11:19.827
How long had she been a prostitute?

11:19.829 --> 11:22.663
Since 15.

11:22.665 --> 11:24.799
And she wanted to get out of that life.

11:24.801 --> 11:25.900
And you were gonna help her?

11:25.902 --> 11:28.903
Yeah.

11:28.905 --> 11:31.439
By letting her trust an
adult for once in her life.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.608
And, look, I...

11:33.610 --> 11:36.244
I have proof all of this is legit.

11:36.246 --> 11:37.945
I recorded my interviews with Maya

11:37.947 --> 11:40.481
and... and some other
girls I was trying to help.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.700
It's all on my laptop.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.636
No laptop found at the house.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.438
Well, then it was stolen.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.273
By whoever did this.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.212
After that accident...

11:55.214 --> 11:57.481
My life changed, Al.

11:59.919 --> 12:03.387
That tunnel they talk about?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.890
I was in it.

12:05.892 --> 12:09.460
And I got pulled back out.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.562
Got pulled out to do
some good in this world.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.766
I got to be honest.

12:16.768 --> 12:19.202
I'm having a lot of
trouble buying all this.

12:21.773 --> 12:24.073
It wasn't me.

12:24.075 --> 12:26.943
Then who was it, Jake?

12:26.945 --> 12:30.480
It had to be her pimp.

12:30.482 --> 12:32.749
So you saying her pimp came
to your house to kill her?

12:32.751 --> 12:33.983
That's the only thing that makes sense.

12:33.985 --> 12:36.052
He's... he's the one she was afraid of.

12:36.054 --> 12:38.387
- Did she give you a name?
- No.

12:38.389 --> 12:41.257
And I never saw him.

12:41.259 --> 12:42.859
But I'm telling you,

12:42.861 --> 12:46.529
she was terrified of him.

12:46.531 --> 12:48.865
Jake, where were you last night?

12:48.867 --> 12:50.466
Came back from a hunting trip.

12:50.468 --> 12:51.934
Late.

12:51.936 --> 12:54.170
Then I crashed at Marley's place.

12:54.172 --> 12:55.872
That's his daughter.

12:59.144 --> 13:01.244
Pimp with no name?

13:01.246 --> 13:02.979
Call Vice, see what they know about her.

13:02.981 --> 13:05.314
And talk to this daughter.

13:12.763 --> 13:15.964
All that stuff on social
media is a total lie.

13:15.966 --> 13:17.633
My father, he couldn't
have hurt that girl.

13:17.635 --> 13:20.469
He was with me.

13:20.471 --> 13:21.904
The whole night?

13:21.906 --> 13:23.238
Yeah.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.340
He was on his way back
from a hunting trip

13:25.342 --> 13:27.643
and he didn't want to
drive all the way home,

13:27.645 --> 13:30.345
so he crashed on my couch.

13:30.347 --> 13:31.980
OK.

13:31.982 --> 13:35.384
And what time, exactly, did he get here?

13:35.386 --> 13:36.752
I don't know.

13:36.754 --> 13:38.854
Sometime after 10:00, I guess.

13:38.856 --> 13:40.989
My daughter's not the one
that committed a crime here.

13:40.991 --> 13:42.791
She's traumatized by what happened.

13:42.793 --> 13:44.526
I-I think it best we have a lawyer here

13:44.528 --> 13:45.961
if you want to ask any more questions.

13:45.963 --> 13:48.597
OK, all right. Marley, how old are you?

13:48.599 --> 13:50.566
- 18.
- All right.

13:50.568 --> 13:53.435
Which means it's your
choice if you talk to us,

13:53.437 --> 13:54.937
not your mom's.

13:54.939 --> 13:57.005
And not her attorney's.

13:57.007 --> 13:59.675
My dad didn't do this.

13:59.677 --> 14:02.845
That's not the question.

14:02.847 --> 14:04.847
Look...

14:04.849 --> 14:07.850
We know that this is a really hard time

14:07.852 --> 14:10.219
and that you believe your dad.

14:10.591 --> 14:13.725
But if we're gonna solve this thing,

14:13.727 --> 14:16.061
and figure out what did happen,

14:16.063 --> 14:18.630
we just need to know
what time he got here.

14:23.704 --> 14:26.705
1:15.

14:26.707 --> 14:29.274
He got here at 1:15.

14:32.562 --> 14:33.628
It's not the first time.

14:33.630 --> 14:34.996
She comes in here when we're busy

14:34.998 --> 14:37.131
and she just grabs bags
from the takeout counter.

14:37.133 --> 14:38.800
- OK, can you describe her?
- I don't know.

14:38.802 --> 14:41.536
She's a black lady. She looks homeless.

14:41.538 --> 14:42.904
She was wearing a plaid shirt.

14:42.906 --> 14:44.973
Plaid shirt. OK.

14:44.975 --> 14:46.307
Thank you.

14:46.309 --> 14:48.576
We're gonna need a pastrami on rye...

14:48.578 --> 14:49.644
Hey! Hey, I see her!

14:49.646 --> 14:51.946
She's right there in the alley.

14:51.948 --> 14:54.282
Yep, that's her.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.883
Yup.

15:02.442 --> 15:03.675
Excuse me.

15:06.413 --> 15:08.446
Where'd you get that sandwich?

15:10.951 --> 15:12.117
Stop!

15:12.119 --> 15:13.285
Hey!

15:20.761 --> 15:22.894
Don't move! Don't move;
You're under arrest.

15:24.898 --> 15:26.164
Taser, taser, taser, taser!

15:44.851 --> 15:46.651
You OK, slugger?

15:48.755 --> 15:50.021
OK, so I just ran her ID.

15:50.023 --> 15:51.256
You're not gonna believe this.

15:51.258 --> 15:53.291
She is a cop.

15:57.434 --> 16:00.935
Jake McCoy's daughter said
he didn't arrive until 1:15.

16:00.937 --> 16:04.506
So if the murder happened at
12:30, then he's got no alibi.

16:04.508 --> 16:06.474
Anything from Vice on Maya's pimp?

16:06.476 --> 16:07.775
Nothing.

16:07.777 --> 16:09.410
OK, what about this laptop of McCoy's?

16:09.412 --> 16:10.411
Been recovered?

16:10.413 --> 16:12.280
Checking pawn shops.

16:27.459 --> 16:29.993
Hello?

16:29.995 --> 16:31.628
Hello?

16:34.466 --> 16:36.132
Who was that?

16:36.134 --> 16:38.334
Don't know. They hung up.

16:38.336 --> 16:41.304
Says the call came from...

16:41.306 --> 16:44.307
Easton, Kansas.

16:44.309 --> 16:45.775
Seriously?

16:45.777 --> 16:47.310
What?

16:47.312 --> 16:50.780
I tracked the florist down.
They're in Easton, Kansas.

16:50.782 --> 16:52.148
They said the flowers
were paid for in cash.

16:52.150 --> 16:53.249
There's no way of
knowing who bought 'em.

16:53.251 --> 16:54.817
What?

16:54.819 --> 16:57.487
I know it's probably nothing,
but I'm gonna run the number.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.429
You know I'm not
trying to protect McCoy.

17:06.431 --> 17:10.032
- I know you're not, Al.
- All right.

17:10.035 --> 17:11.701
I think you're trying
to protect yourself

17:11.703 --> 17:15.104
from believing McCoy was just
working you this whole time.

17:25.242 --> 17:26.675
Commander.

17:26.676 --> 17:29.044
Detective.

17:29.046 --> 17:31.913
I've been told you had a previous
relationship with Jake McCoy.

17:31.915 --> 17:34.249
Is that true?

17:34.251 --> 17:35.784
Yeah.

17:35.786 --> 17:37.152
But it's not gonna be a problem.

17:37.154 --> 17:38.520
It's a problem for me.

17:38.522 --> 17:40.255
This case has been getting
enough attention already.

17:40.257 --> 17:41.423
I'm taking you off.

17:41.425 --> 17:44.559
No one wants to find out what
happened to the girl more than I.

17:44.561 --> 17:45.894
No one's gonna work harder to...

17:45.896 --> 17:46.962
I appreciate that, Al.

17:46.964 --> 17:48.997
But you're off the case.

18:07.017 --> 18:09.084
- Was I not clear?
- You were, Commander.

18:09.086 --> 18:10.518
And I'm, you know, I'm just gonna stay

18:10.520 --> 18:12.520
right here at my desk.

18:12.522 --> 18:15.090
What, you want my badge? Here.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.293
Come and get it.

18:21.765 --> 18:25.000
I don't need an invitation, Detective.

18:25.002 --> 18:26.635
You interfere with this case,

18:26.637 --> 18:28.937
that badge is gone.

18:28.939 --> 18:30.572
All right.

18:40.258 --> 18:42.391
We got a tip from the pawn shop sweep.

18:42.393 --> 18:45.161
Somebody just tried to pawn a
bunch of stuff from Jake McCoy.

18:45.163 --> 18:46.595
Guy named John Dolan.

18:46.597 --> 18:48.831
He's got one prior for burglary.

18:51.002 --> 18:53.269
All right, have Ruzek
and Atwater hit it.

19:13.350 --> 19:15.517
John Dolan, this is Chicago PD.

19:17.021 --> 19:18.353
Just a minute.

19:22.159 --> 19:23.292
That's my door!

19:23.294 --> 19:26.195
This is a search warrant. Sit down.

19:26.197 --> 19:27.696
Search warrant? What for?

19:27.698 --> 19:30.132
Really? Right here on the table?

19:30.414 --> 19:33.215
Wha... I'm a garbage picker.

19:33.217 --> 19:36.785
I-I swear, I found all
this stuff in the trash.

19:36.787 --> 19:39.354
I swear to God.

19:43.407 --> 19:45.106
So you know Jake McCoy?

19:45.108 --> 19:46.841
I know he's famous.

19:46.843 --> 19:48.176
I didn't know what happened.

19:48.178 --> 19:50.312
Not until I tried to pawn this stuff.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.981
You found thousands of dollars
worth of sports memorabilia

19:52.983 --> 19:54.482
next to kitty litter?

19:54.484 --> 19:59.254
Well, you wouldn't believe
what rich people throw away.

19:59.256 --> 20:00.755
Was this laptop out there in the trash

20:00.757 --> 20:01.957
with the rest of McCoy's stuff?

20:01.959 --> 20:03.391
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

20:07.230 --> 20:10.865
So McCoy had a file called "Lost girls."

20:10.867 --> 20:13.201
I found Maya Collins.

20:13.383 --> 20:15.316
So you're, like, famous
or something, right?

20:15.318 --> 20:16.818
My friend said you were.

20:16.820 --> 20:19.621
I want to know about you.

20:19.623 --> 20:21.456
Where are you from?

20:21.458 --> 20:25.026
I am from the moon.

20:25.028 --> 20:27.395
Come on, just tell me.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.001
Hailey, Idaho.

20:33.003 --> 20:34.903
Yeah.

20:34.905 --> 20:36.938
Might as well be the moon.

20:36.940 --> 20:38.373
And how old are you?

20:38.375 --> 20:41.543
I am 16.

20:41.545 --> 20:43.478
Your parents know that you're here?

20:43.480 --> 20:45.313
Do you think they'd care?

20:47.517 --> 20:49.784
So how do you feel?

20:49.786 --> 20:52.587
I mean, doing what you're doing?

20:55.358 --> 20:58.393
Wait, you seriously just want to talk?

20:59.496 --> 21:02.030
Yes.

21:02.032 --> 21:04.332
I want to help you.

21:09.012 --> 21:10.778
He has three more files just like that.

21:10.780 --> 21:13.080
No sex, just talking.

21:13.082 --> 21:14.815
Maybe McCoy was telling the truth.

21:27.554 --> 21:30.089
That right there proves I was
trying to help these girls.

21:30.091 --> 21:31.690
All that proves is

21:31.692 --> 21:33.225
you had a preexisting
relationship with Maya.

21:33.227 --> 21:34.527
You still can't account
for where you were

21:34.529 --> 21:35.561
at the time of her death.

21:35.743 --> 21:37.142
I was at my daughter's.

21:37.144 --> 21:39.912
After. You were there after.

21:39.914 --> 21:41.580
I can't win with you guys.

21:41.582 --> 21:42.915
If you were concerned for Maya,

21:42.917 --> 21:44.149
why not go to the police?

21:44.151 --> 21:46.585
Why? So you could arrest her?

21:46.587 --> 21:47.653
That's not gonna change anything.

21:47.655 --> 21:49.254
Is Detective Olinsky here?

21:49.256 --> 21:50.322
He'd like to speak
with Detective Olinsky.

21:50.324 --> 21:51.590
Not here.

21:51.592 --> 21:54.360
So what were you gonna
do with these videos?

21:54.632 --> 21:56.665
I was gonna contact their families.

21:56.667 --> 21:58.033
Use this as an intervention.

21:58.035 --> 22:01.003
Try to bring them together.

22:01.005 --> 22:02.404
These girls were runaways.

22:02.406 --> 22:05.474
They're addicts.

22:05.476 --> 22:08.377
I was an addict.

22:10.014 --> 22:11.813
I wasn't having sex with these girls.

22:11.815 --> 22:13.448
I was trying to...

22:13.450 --> 22:15.150
Show them the light.

22:15.352 --> 22:16.785
Then tell us who killed Maya.

22:16.787 --> 22:18.053
I told you, her pimp, OK?

22:18.055 --> 22:19.855
- Where's... where's Al?
- OK.

22:19.857 --> 22:23.458
I think we're done here for now and I
would like to request my client's release.

22:23.460 --> 22:25.727
I still don't have to
charge him for 12 hours.

22:25.729 --> 22:27.295
He stays in lock-up.

22:36.677 --> 22:39.177
OK, Vicky.

22:39.179 --> 22:41.613
Let's start over.

22:41.615 --> 22:43.448
I'm Kim.

22:43.450 --> 22:45.250
Can you just tell me what's going on?

22:47.154 --> 22:48.286
Look, I know you're police.

22:48.288 --> 22:49.554
You were on the force in St. Louis.

22:49.636 --> 22:52.070
Keep this up, sister,
you're gonna make detective.

22:52.072 --> 22:53.505
I am on your side, OK?

22:53.507 --> 22:55.340
I'm trying to help you.

22:55.342 --> 22:57.509
- Why are you living like this?
- I know the drill.

22:57.511 --> 22:59.043
If you're gonna pinch me, pinch me.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.212
If not, I'm walking out that door.

23:06.106 --> 23:09.608
McCoy made videos with three
other prostitutes besides Maya.

23:09.610 --> 23:11.877
All of them the same thing...
No sex, just asking questions.

23:11.879 --> 23:13.779
So McCoy really was
trying to help those girls.

23:13.781 --> 23:15.347
Maybe, but whether or not he killed Maya

23:15.349 --> 23:16.648
is still to be determined.

23:16.650 --> 23:19.117
Vice was able to ID one of
the girls from the videos.

23:19.119 --> 23:20.586
Her name is Alicia Meyers.

23:20.588 --> 23:22.955
She's got two priors for solicitation

23:22.957 --> 23:25.991
and she got popped in the
same sweep as Maya a year ago.

23:25.993 --> 23:27.593
They got any information on her pimp?

23:27.595 --> 23:30.128
No, but they know which
motel she turns tricks at.

23:30.130 --> 23:32.164
Check it out.

23:35.970 --> 23:37.269
Hey.

23:37.271 --> 23:38.637
We're looking for her.

23:41.141 --> 23:42.908
How long you want?

23:46.180 --> 23:47.479
This long.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.483
Look, my friend called me and
said there was a party here,

23:51.485 --> 23:52.985
so I'm not doing anything illegal.

23:52.987 --> 23:54.820
We're not here to arrest you, Alicia.

23:54.822 --> 23:57.723
- Great, see ya.
- We need your help.

23:57.725 --> 23:59.558
Look, I'm gonna scream.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.727
I'm gonna scream here in
two seconds if you don't...

24:01.729 --> 24:05.063
This is your friend, Maya.

24:05.155 --> 24:07.055
She was murdered.

24:07.057 --> 24:09.024
And we think that whoever she works for,

24:09.026 --> 24:11.159
her pimp, did this to her.

24:11.161 --> 24:13.428
What's his name?

24:13.430 --> 24:16.531
Alicia, who is he?

24:16.533 --> 24:19.701
Saint.

24:19.703 --> 24:21.737
Saint's your pimp, too?

24:21.739 --> 24:25.807
Yeah. He killed Maya.

24:25.809 --> 24:27.943
How do you know that?

24:27.945 --> 24:30.112
He has a saying.

24:30.274 --> 24:31.706
"You fly, you die."

24:31.708 --> 24:34.509
- So Maya was trying to get out?
- Yeah, that...

24:34.511 --> 24:37.179
That baseball player said he
was gonna take care of her.

24:39.283 --> 24:41.716
Is that him? You talking about this guy?

24:41.718 --> 24:43.218
Yeah, that's the guy.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.520
To me, he seemed like a regular john.

24:45.522 --> 24:47.022
Alicia.

24:47.274 --> 24:49.107
When's the next time you see him?

24:49.109 --> 24:51.309
No, no, Saint has eyes everywhere.

24:51.311 --> 24:53.678
We're gonna get this guy off
the street, I promise you that.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.681
- Well, you better be damn sure.
- I am sure.

25:00.854 --> 25:03.755
Saint comes around at five
to midnight to get his money.

25:07.247 --> 25:09.447
How do you feel about what you do, Maya?

25:11.351 --> 25:14.218
How do you think I feel?

25:14.220 --> 25:17.855
I'm asking you.

25:17.857 --> 25:20.325
It's like...

25:20.327 --> 25:22.427
It's like you're not even

25:22.429 --> 25:24.662
a human being sometimes.

25:24.664 --> 25:26.931
You know, it's like...

25:28.635 --> 25:31.469
It's like you're just a
piece of tissue or something.

25:35.942 --> 25:39.377
Um, yeah, I don't really
want to talk about it anymore.

26:15.186 --> 26:17.219
This is Saint.

26:21.926 --> 26:23.325
Hey, hey, who got something for me?

26:23.327 --> 26:24.627
Come on.

26:24.629 --> 26:26.462
All right, ladies, who
got something for me?

26:27.431 --> 26:28.764
That's what I'm talking about.

26:28.766 --> 26:29.899
All right, talk to me.

26:29.901 --> 26:31.233
Y'all take your time.

26:32.570 --> 26:34.870
All right, all right.

26:34.872 --> 26:35.905
Move in.

26:42.213 --> 26:43.612
Chicago PD!

26:43.614 --> 26:45.314
Don't move; Keep your
hands where we can see them.

26:45.316 --> 26:46.682
- Hey, hey, hey, what is this?
- Get on your knees!

26:46.684 --> 26:49.151
Did you really think
you could just kill Maya?

26:49.153 --> 26:50.519
Bitch, you talking crazy.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.221
- She was my friend!
- That's enough.

26:52.223 --> 26:53.422
She was my friend and you killed her!

26:53.424 --> 26:55.524
Hey, I don't know
what she talking about.

26:55.526 --> 26:56.859
Hey, Sarge.

26:56.861 --> 26:58.994
Looks like we got an All
Star ring in the glove box.

26:58.996 --> 27:00.996
Hey, that's not what it looks like.

27:00.998 --> 27:03.032
It never is.

27:14.254 --> 27:16.589
Hey, Maya told me she was
18. I took her word for it.

27:16.591 --> 27:19.025
Maya was trying to
get away from you, bro.

27:19.027 --> 27:20.827
No, man, Maya was confused.

27:20.829 --> 27:22.161
McCoy got into her head,

27:22.163 --> 27:24.330
big hitter with all his
money, promising her the world?

27:24.332 --> 27:25.465
And she just fell for it.

27:25.467 --> 27:26.466
So you knew McCoy?

27:26.468 --> 27:28.034
I knew he liked girls I knew.

27:28.036 --> 27:29.602
You know a guy named Freddy?

27:29.604 --> 27:30.803
Worked for McCoy.

27:30.805 --> 27:32.205
I know a couple guys named Freddy.

27:32.207 --> 27:34.140
You ever been to McCoy's house?

27:34.142 --> 27:36.142
- Nope.
- Then how'd you get his ring?

27:36.144 --> 27:38.411
It was a gift. From Maya.

27:38.413 --> 27:40.613
She was an All Star third baseman?

27:40.615 --> 27:42.248
No, man.

27:42.250 --> 27:45.751
Look, McCoy gave it to
Maya, Maya gave it to me.

27:45.753 --> 27:48.020
People give me stuff all the time.

27:48.022 --> 27:49.789
I didn't want to take it, but
I didn't want to offend her, so,

27:49.791 --> 27:51.924
you know, it's yours, if you want it.

27:51.926 --> 27:53.126
All right, listen to me.

27:53.128 --> 27:55.962
Guys like you, who run underage girls...

27:59.200 --> 28:01.334
You have a special place for me.

28:01.336 --> 28:02.969
So...

28:02.971 --> 28:05.738
You're gonna get honest.

28:05.740 --> 28:07.840
Now listen.

28:09.244 --> 28:11.477
What did you do to Maya?

28:11.479 --> 28:13.479
Like I told you before, nothing.

28:18.786 --> 28:20.419
Yo, hey! All right,
all right, all right!

28:20.421 --> 28:21.487
All right, all right, look!

28:21.489 --> 28:22.855
Look, I ran Maya, OK?

28:22.857 --> 28:24.290
I admit that!

28:24.292 --> 28:26.959
But she was alive the
last time I saw her, OK?

28:33.268 --> 28:35.735
Sarge. Sarge.

28:35.737 --> 28:37.069
I was wondering if we could maybe

28:37.071 --> 28:40.139
make this Manny's thing go away?

28:40.141 --> 28:41.741
Why would we do that?

28:41.743 --> 28:43.910
She threw a citizen
across the restaurant

28:43.912 --> 28:46.379
and she elbowed a police
officer in the face.

28:46.381 --> 28:47.647
You want her to go away?

28:47.649 --> 28:48.981
She's gonna go away
for aggravated battery.

28:48.983 --> 28:51.250
OK, the lady's name is Vicky Metzler.

28:51.252 --> 28:53.319
OK, my God, she's a lady now.

28:53.321 --> 28:54.787
Is that... Are you hearing this?

28:54.789 --> 28:57.390
She is a cop, she's a former
cop, she's from St. Louis.

28:57.392 --> 28:59.392
OK, OK, so what happened?

28:59.394 --> 29:01.227
She wouldn't tell me,
but I got a friend there.

29:01.229 --> 29:03.029
Story is, her and her
partner were chasing

29:03.031 --> 29:04.730
a robbery suspect high speed.

29:04.732 --> 29:07.934
Suspect plows into another car
and kills a mother and two kids.

29:07.936 --> 29:09.769
Vicky was never the same.

29:09.771 --> 29:11.437
I mean, she's one of us, Sarge.

29:11.439 --> 29:13.639
Yeah, I get it, but...

29:13.641 --> 29:16.576
Manny
already signed a complaint.

29:16.578 --> 29:18.544
She's gonna have to do
a night in the lockup.

29:18.546 --> 29:20.379
But there's got to be
something that we can do.

29:20.381 --> 29:22.281
We did do something, Kim.

29:22.283 --> 29:23.616
Our job.

29:34.596 --> 29:36.262
Hi, how you doing?

29:36.264 --> 29:38.231
How you holding up?

29:38.233 --> 29:40.499
I'm really worried about my dad.

29:40.501 --> 29:42.868
- Yeah.
- How's he doing?

29:42.870 --> 29:46.672
Well, you know, he's
in a tough spot, Marley.

29:46.674 --> 29:49.308
You don't think he did it, right?

29:49.310 --> 29:51.777
No.

29:51.779 --> 29:55.047
You know, a lot of my
dad's so-called friends

29:55.049 --> 29:56.916
were always after something.

29:56.918 --> 30:00.086
His money, his fame.

30:00.088 --> 30:01.487
Except you.

30:01.489 --> 30:05.124
You never wanted anything from him.

30:05.126 --> 30:07.793
So your father was here last night?

30:07.795 --> 30:09.495
Yes.

30:09.497 --> 30:11.864
What did you guys do?

30:11.866 --> 30:13.199
Nothing. Um...

30:13.201 --> 30:15.067
It was late, so I set
him up on the couch

30:15.069 --> 30:16.602
and went back to bed.

30:16.604 --> 30:19.538
So you guys didn't talk?

30:19.540 --> 30:22.808
Not really.

30:22.810 --> 30:25.044
How did he seem?

30:25.046 --> 30:26.879
Like normal.

30:26.881 --> 30:28.881
He was a little worked up
after he talked to Freddy,

30:28.883 --> 30:32.051
but you know Freddy, he
always gets on my dad's nerves.

30:32.053 --> 30:33.986
He called Freddy?

30:33.988 --> 30:37.223
Is that bad?

30:37.225 --> 30:39.458
Well, it's just that
we ran his phone records

30:39.460 --> 30:42.128
and, you know, that...

30:42.130 --> 30:44.130
That call didn't come up.

30:44.132 --> 30:46.499
That's because he used my phone.

30:53.708 --> 30:56.809
Did I just screw up?

31:04.185 --> 31:05.751
Freddy, you got a minute?

31:05.753 --> 31:08.321
Actually, I'm in kind of
a hurry, but what's up?

31:14.062 --> 31:16.429
When was...

31:16.431 --> 31:18.831
When was the last time
you talked to Jake?

31:18.833 --> 31:22.635
I told you, he fired me, remember?

31:22.637 --> 31:25.671
You didn't talk to
him at all last night?

31:25.673 --> 31:28.341
You here as a cop or a friend?

31:30.078 --> 31:32.445
Did you talk to him last night?

31:33.548 --> 31:35.247
No.

31:39.087 --> 31:42.788
I really wish you would've said yes.

31:42.790 --> 31:45.791
'Cause I know he called you
from his daughter's phone.

31:46.894 --> 31:49.762
It was 11:38.

31:49.764 --> 31:52.398
Call lasted six minutes.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.701
But what I don't know...

31:55.703 --> 31:58.904
Is the content of that conversation.

31:58.906 --> 32:00.239
Man, Al, what're we gonna do?

32:00.241 --> 32:03.609
- Just tell me what happened!
- Whoa.

32:03.611 --> 32:05.578
Hey, whoa.

32:05.580 --> 32:08.247
Easy now, Al.

32:08.249 --> 32:11.350
We've all got skin in the game.

32:11.352 --> 32:13.986
What do you mean by that?

32:13.988 --> 32:15.988
Plenty of parties.

32:15.990 --> 32:18.858
Yeah? Plenty of pictures.

32:18.860 --> 32:21.394
You're in a lot of 'em.

32:21.396 --> 32:22.962
A lot of stuff getting passed around.

32:24.399 --> 32:27.199
Pictures that'd get
your job lost real quick.

32:32.006 --> 32:34.607
Are you threatening me?

32:34.609 --> 32:36.308
Hate to bring it up
like this, but, hey, man,

32:36.310 --> 32:37.543
if you're gonna come
in here and flex on me,

32:37.545 --> 32:39.712
I'm gonna do the same, so...

32:41.949 --> 32:43.416
How about we both just figure out a way

32:43.418 --> 32:45.584
to make this thing go away?

32:45.586 --> 32:49.588
You know, we were all playing a role

32:49.590 --> 32:52.458
at Jake's house, weren't we, Freddy?

32:52.460 --> 32:56.796
I was the dumb cop you guys
had in your back pocket.

32:56.798 --> 32:58.164
Till you needed a favor.

32:58.166 --> 32:59.865
No, that ain't true, Al...

32:59.867 --> 33:02.368
No, no, no, no, I...

33:02.370 --> 33:04.236
I think it is.

33:08.810 --> 33:10.509
Come on, man.

33:10.511 --> 33:12.745
Unless you tell me what
happened to that girl.

33:15.817 --> 33:17.783
What happened to that girl?

33:17.785 --> 33:19.685
What happened?

33:20.655 --> 33:22.988
See if he wants to talk.

33:26.828 --> 33:29.762
Stand right here.

33:29.764 --> 33:31.630
Where's Jake?

33:37.145 --> 33:38.145
Come on.

33:41.260 --> 33:43.327
Detective, I was very specific.

33:43.329 --> 33:45.629
Do you want to know what
happened to that girl or not?

33:45.631 --> 33:48.432
'Cause I could get McCoy to talk.

33:48.434 --> 33:50.267
So you're not gonna
feed him information?

33:50.269 --> 33:53.136
Help him get out of this charge, too?

33:53.138 --> 33:55.238
No, I'm not.

33:58.010 --> 34:00.811
I'm gonna go get a sandwich.

34:00.813 --> 34:03.413
Maybe an iced tea, as well.

34:03.415 --> 34:06.249
Probably take me about 45 minutes.

34:06.451 --> 34:07.851
When I return,

34:07.853 --> 34:08.918
it'll be for your badge.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.420
And a to-from.

34:10.422 --> 34:12.355
And I'm recommending
a ten-day suspension

34:12.357 --> 34:15.324
and mandatory enrollment in the
behavior intervention system.

34:17.062 --> 34:20.463
Welcome to the new and improved
Chicago Police Department, Al.

34:30.976 --> 34:33.510
Hey, Al.

34:33.512 --> 34:35.145
Thank God.

34:35.147 --> 34:37.813
Where you been?

34:37.815 --> 34:39.916
Listen.

34:42.788 --> 34:46.690
You remember how I
made that DUI go away?

34:46.692 --> 34:48.625
Yeah.

34:48.627 --> 34:51.527
I can help you with this, too.

34:51.530 --> 34:53.663
But I'm gonna need
to know what happened.

34:56.568 --> 34:58.235
It's just you and me.

34:58.237 --> 35:02.539
But when I tell you that there's
no more time for dicking around...

35:04.977 --> 35:06.876
Just got to believe me.

35:14.586 --> 35:17.187
It was an accident.

35:22.828 --> 35:25.929
I let Maya stay at my place
to get back on her feet.

35:28.667 --> 35:30.634
And I did go away on that hunting trip,

35:30.636 --> 35:34.604
but I came back a day
early, and I found her...

35:36.341 --> 35:38.208
She had all my watches.

35:38.210 --> 35:41.378
All my money.

35:41.380 --> 35:44.547
She'd been stealing from me.

35:44.549 --> 35:47.317
After all I'd done for her, I
mean, how... how would you feel?

35:47.319 --> 35:49.986
Betrayed.

35:49.988 --> 35:53.290
Yeah.

35:53.292 --> 35:56.293
Then I-I pushed her.

35:56.295 --> 35:59.796
And she fell backwards and hit her head.

36:02.301 --> 36:04.701
And the...

36:07.673 --> 36:10.373
Blood started coming out.

36:13.745 --> 36:15.078
I...

36:15.080 --> 36:17.147
All I ever wanted to do was help her.

36:17.149 --> 36:20.450
Yeah.

36:20.452 --> 36:23.353
Why didn't you call an ambulance?

36:23.355 --> 36:26.122
Because she was dead.

36:28.593 --> 36:31.294
And I knew how that would look, so I...

36:31.296 --> 36:33.530
I bolted.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.967
I went to Marley's.

36:37.969 --> 36:41.504
And I called Freddy.

36:41.506 --> 36:44.941
He said he'd go back and
make it look like a robbery.

36:48.113 --> 36:50.080
It was an accident, Al.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.315
It was an accident.

36:58.690 --> 37:00.857
It's all right.

37:05.630 --> 37:07.964
So...

37:09.901 --> 37:12.836
What's the plan?

37:12.838 --> 37:16.039
What do we do? What should I say?

37:22.681 --> 37:24.547
Based on Jake McCoy's confession,

37:24.549 --> 37:27.684
we're gonna file a complaint
for voluntary manslaughter.

37:27.686 --> 37:29.953
He'll be in bond court tomorrow.

37:33.992 --> 37:35.692
Some friend.

37:42.401 --> 37:44.501
Um...

38:08.727 --> 38:11.661
You know, I had a chance
to take him off the street.

38:11.663 --> 38:14.864
You know, I could've let him
take the ride on that DUI.

38:16.935 --> 38:19.569
Maybe he'd be in a program now, or...

38:19.571 --> 38:21.671
Or locked up.

38:23.675 --> 38:26.142
She'd still be alive.

38:55.325 --> 38:58.893
OK, so the phone number is a hard line

38:58.895 --> 39:01.062
that's connected to a
local diner in Easton,

39:01.064 --> 39:02.897
which is right outside of Leavenworth.

39:02.899 --> 39:04.332
Outside the penitentiary.

39:04.334 --> 39:06.067
Yep, I spoke to the local sheriff

39:06.069 --> 39:08.970
and he says it sounds a lot like
this whack job they have in town

39:08.972 --> 39:10.705
who does stuff like this all the time.

39:10.707 --> 39:12.640
He's a Peeping Tom
type; They picked him up.

39:12.642 --> 39:16.511
He's locked up. He's in
county, so we're good.

39:16.513 --> 39:19.314
It's weird.

39:19.316 --> 39:23.384
You know, my mom told me once my
father did a stretch in Leavenworth.

39:43.406 --> 39:46.040
What're you doing here?

39:46.042 --> 39:48.810
I'm staying here until
you get out tomorrow.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.113
Why?

39:52.115 --> 39:55.049
Vicky, I know what happened.

39:55.051 --> 39:58.052
And it could've happened
to any one of us, so...

40:01.691 --> 40:04.158
I'm not gonna leave you alone.

40:08.832 --> 40:12.200
I was the cop you never
wanted to mess with.

40:12.202 --> 40:14.569
I got my teeth in you,
I was a dog on a bone.

40:14.571 --> 40:16.804
I never let go.

40:16.806 --> 40:19.140
So when that guy drove
off and tried to get away,

40:19.142 --> 40:22.710
I was gonna chase him
to the ends of the earth.

40:26.082 --> 40:28.516
I can't get past it.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.222
I'm here.

40:41.464 --> 40:43.765
So what would you change?

40:43.767 --> 40:45.800
If you could?

40:45.802 --> 40:49.504
Just one thing.

40:49.506 --> 40:52.840
What difference would it make?

40:52.842 --> 40:54.676
Got to be something.

40:55.812 --> 40:58.713
Something you'd change or...

40:58.715 --> 41:01.950
Maybe just something
you could have right now.

41:03.753 --> 41:06.955
OK, so if I had a
magic wand or something.

41:06.957 --> 41:09.390
Yeah.

41:09.392 --> 41:12.260
OK, um...

41:12.262 --> 41:14.629
I wish...

41:14.631 --> 41:16.731
Um...

41:25.041 --> 41:27.041
Um...

41:31.881 --> 41:33.982
I...

41:40.190 --> 41:43.858
I-I wish I...

42:18.598 --> 42:23.598
