00:17.514 --> 00:18.514
Good morning.

00:18.515 --> 00:19.681
Good morning.

00:19.683 --> 00:21.750
You the one that called us?
Yes, officers.

00:21.752 --> 00:23.952
I came to open up the bank
this morning,

00:23.954 --> 00:25.187
and I found this...

00:25.189 --> 00:27.756
person...
sleeping by the ATMs.

00:27.758 --> 00:29.457
Now, I don't know if he's drunk,

00:29.459 --> 00:31.693
but he is passed out
and he smells.

00:31.695 --> 00:32.894
Ugh.

00:32.896 --> 00:34.096
He's disturbing our customers,

00:34.097 --> 00:35.864
so can you please
get rid of him?

00:35.866 --> 00:36.866
Yeah. You got it.

00:36.867 --> 00:38.033
Yeah, we got it.
Thank you.

00:38.035 --> 00:40.602
Did you ever think
it'd be this glamorous?

00:40.604 --> 00:43.038
All right!

00:43.040 --> 00:44.306
Time to check out.

00:44.308 --> 00:46.041
That's right.
Rise and shine.

00:46.043 --> 00:47.275
(sighs)

00:47.277 --> 00:48.277
Come on.

00:48.278 --> 00:49.845
Let's go, let's go.

00:53.617 --> 00:55.217
You okay?

00:57.421 --> 00:59.061
How old are you, bud?
Wh-What's your name?

01:00.591 --> 01:01.857
How'd you end up here?

01:03.560 --> 01:05.327
Is there someone
that we can call?

01:05.328 --> 01:07.329
You can talk to us.

01:07.331 --> 01:08.396
You're not in any trouble.

01:08.398 --> 01:09.664
Officers, please.

01:09.666 --> 01:11.366
Yeah.

01:14.371 --> 01:16.872
Why don't we get him
back to the precinct.

01:16.874 --> 01:18.940
All right. Sounds good.
Call ACS.

01:19.810 --> 01:21.576
Hey! Hey!

01:25.616 --> 01:26.715
Hey!
Hey, move!

01:26.717 --> 01:27.749
Move!

01:27.751 --> 01:29.651
Stop! Hey!

01:29.653 --> 01:30.952
(horn blaring)
Whoa!

01:30.954 --> 01:32.721
What are you doing, huh?
Why you running?

01:32.723 --> 01:34.823
(grunting)
Why you running, huh?

01:34.825 --> 01:36.892
Can't be seen with no cops.

01:36.894 --> 01:38.260
Yeah? Well, why?

01:38.262 --> 01:40.362
What are you afraid of?

01:41.265 --> 01:43.899
All right. Come on.

01:43.901 --> 01:45.200
Let's go.

01:48.472 --> 01:49.804
Put any weight on it?

01:49.806 --> 01:51.740
Not without moaning.

01:51.742 --> 01:53.642
I told him to be careful
of the black ice.

01:53.644 --> 01:54.910
You can't see it.

01:54.912 --> 01:56.878
Well, how in the hell
can you be careful of something

01:56.880 --> 01:58.046
you can't see?

01:58.048 --> 01:59.881
I think it's
just a sprain,

01:59.883 --> 02:02.284
but the swelling has to go down
before we can even do an MRI,

02:02.286 --> 02:04.753
so you-you have to keep it
iced and elevated.

02:04.755 --> 02:06.021
Well, I got to get to work.

02:06.023 --> 02:07.389
You'll have to do it
from here, Frank.

02:07.391 --> 02:09.124
I'm sorry.
HENRY: Francis.

02:09.126 --> 02:10.758
From when I had my hip surgery.

02:10.761 --> 02:13.728
Gee, thanks.

02:13.730 --> 02:21.372
Little time off won't kill you.
Now, I'll check in with you later..

02:21.374 --> 02:24.142
Last time, they had to shoot me.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.946
(knocking)

02:28.948 --> 02:30.815
Mm, Evan Beck.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.116
I thought I smelled you coming.

02:32.118 --> 02:33.785
I hope you didn't wear
all that cologne just for me.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.253
No.

02:35.255 --> 02:38.055
But, uh, I do come
bearing gifts.

02:38.057 --> 02:39.824
Listen, I'm, uh,

02:39.826 --> 02:41.492
ready to deal
on Thomas Kowalski,

02:41.494 --> 02:43.294
save us both
a lot of aggravation.

02:43.296 --> 02:44.595
I'm listening.

02:44.597 --> 02:46.497
He's willing to
plead to possession.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.100
It's a first offense, so
how does, uh, six months in jail

02:49.102 --> 02:50.501
and court-mandated rehab sound?

02:50.503 --> 02:52.904
Generous, but I'm not pleading
this one out.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.705
You're going for intent to sell?

02:54.707 --> 02:56.207
Come on, Erin,

02:56.209 --> 02:57.842
all the guy did was run
a red light, and we both know

02:57.844 --> 02:58.943
the amounts were
on the borderline.

02:58.945 --> 03:00.244
Okay, that's not all he did.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.280
He was intoxicated and
belligerent with the officers.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.548
That's why he was arrested,

03:03.550 --> 03:05.316
and then they found the drugs
in the car.

03:05.318 --> 03:07.018
Yeah, you're just being
a hard-ass

03:07.020 --> 03:09.187
because Thomas is a guard
at Rikers Island

03:09.189 --> 03:11.122
and it's gonna be
a whole scandal in the press

03:11.124 --> 03:12.256
and you love that.

03:12.258 --> 03:14.125
I love beating you, Evan.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.761
This really is about me,
isn't it?

03:16.763 --> 03:18.863
You're still mad
about our last case?

03:18.865 --> 03:21.265
I won. Why would I be mad?
Because I accused you

03:21.267 --> 03:22.900
of withholding evidence
and dragged your name

03:22.902 --> 03:24.836
through the mud. Yeah,
I'm just gonna speak to McCoy,

03:24.838 --> 03:26.270
try to get another prosecutor
assigned.

03:26.272 --> 03:27.672
Happy hunting,

03:27.674 --> 03:29.874
but I'll be seeing you in court.
And why don't you tell

03:29.876 --> 03:31.409
your client
to bring his toothbrush.

03:31.411 --> 03:33.277
He's gonna be going away
for about a decade.

03:33.279 --> 03:35.480
Well, we'll see about that.

03:41.287 --> 03:43.988
JAMIE: Children's Services is
gonna get you some housing,

03:43.990 --> 03:47.124
but it's gonna take at least
a few more hours, so...

03:47.126 --> 03:49.260
why don't you tell us
what's going on.

03:49.262 --> 03:51.128
We can't help if
we don't know.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.697
You want to help me?

03:52.699 --> 03:55.633
Go get me a sandwich.
I'm a growing boy.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.903
We got candy and
chips in the machine.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.471
Those are your choices.

04:00.473 --> 04:03.174
Get me a chocolate bar then.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.877
I'll go.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.979
You're real sweet.

04:12.785 --> 04:14.752
Where you from, TJ?

04:14.754 --> 04:17.387
Baltimore. Moved here
a couple weeks ago.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.390
Why'd you move?

04:18.391 --> 04:20.291
Mom got locked up.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.192
For what?

04:21.194 --> 04:22.693
Drugs.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.363
Sent me on the bus
to my Aunt Christy,

04:25.365 --> 04:27.365
gave her money
to take care of me.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.734
Christy? What's her full name?

04:29.736 --> 04:31.502
Christy Stewart.

04:31.504 --> 04:32.737
Where'd you two stay?

04:32.739 --> 04:34.338
The city.

04:34.340 --> 04:37.275
She has a cart we fill
with bottles and cans.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.577
We recycle them.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.479
That's our hustle.

04:41.481 --> 04:45.249
So what happened? How'd you
wind up at that bank alone?

04:45.251 --> 04:47.418
JANKO:
Whatever it is,

04:47.420 --> 04:50.021
we'll protect you.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.590
That'd be a first.

04:52.592 --> 04:55.726
Try us.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.795
(scoffs)

04:59.566 --> 05:03.401
Two nights ago,
my aunt disappeared.

05:03.403 --> 05:07.305
I think her boyfriend--
this dude they call Ghost--

05:07.307 --> 05:09.173
killed her.

05:10.710 --> 05:13.277
Is that who you're afraid of?

05:15.548 --> 05:18.215
Why do you think he killed her?
Did you see him do it?

05:19.285 --> 05:21.052
You actually see her body?

05:21.054 --> 05:23.421
No. I found her cart.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.490
It was... crashed out in a lot.

05:26.492 --> 05:29.660
All her stuff was on the ground.

05:31.898 --> 05:33.764
I found this.

05:39.739 --> 05:43.274
Christy would never leave me
out on the street.

05:45.645 --> 05:48.245
I know she got killed.

You look like death warmed over.

06:28.655 --> 06:32.056
Well, you would, too, boss, if
you only had three hours' sleep.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.158
What's going on?

06:34.160 --> 06:37.695
I had a court appearance
yesterday, did a tour with Baez,

06:37.697 --> 06:40.164
and then I had
a late-night stakeout detail

06:40.166 --> 06:41.933
with Major Crimes.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.202
Why are you bucking
for so much overtime?

06:44.204 --> 06:46.571
Because my son Jack
flunked algebra,

06:46.573 --> 06:50.041
so we had to do an
educational evaluation.

06:50.043 --> 06:53.811
Now he needs private school and
special tutors for every class.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.780
Oh, my.
In my day,

06:55.782 --> 06:57.381
that would've made
you a “D” student.

06:57.383 --> 06:59.250
Now it's a
freakin' racket.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.587
My wife is indulging it,
to say the least.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.754
Hey, Danny.

07:03.756 --> 07:04.722
Stan.

07:04.724 --> 07:05.790
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Mm.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.625
Uh, those keys to the apartment.

07:07.627 --> 07:10.528
Yeah.
Come check it out anytime you want.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.930
I'll be sure to do that.
Thank you.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.101
What's this?

07:17.103 --> 07:19.270
Stan, Martinez and Hanlon--

07:19.272 --> 07:21.606
they keep an apartment
near the precinct.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.075
They crash there a couple,
two, three nights a week.

07:24.077 --> 07:27.278
Oh, I-I know
what those apartments are for.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.614
Well, this isn't that.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.716
Stan is a hell of a guy.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.918
He's an usher
at my church.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.187
It's nice to know
what you think about men though.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.456
But this place
is just for sleep.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.492
Mm-hmm.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.930
FRANK:
<i>First of all,</i>

07:45.932 --> 07:47.231
I'm sorry
about the inconvenience.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.433
Thanks for coming out out.
If Muhammad

07:49.435 --> 07:51.569
can't come to the mountain, the
mountain must come to Muhammad.

07:51.571 --> 07:54.538
Let's just get to the agenda.
Thank you, Baker.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.140
In what order, boss?
I don't know, Sid.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.109
Bad news first.
Okay.

07:58.111 --> 08:01.078
Unless there's some really
good news that just can't wait.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.180
It's, uh, pretty much just...
Bad news,

08:03.182 --> 08:03.948
worse news.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.249
Just start.
Okay.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.851
The police union is proposing--

08:06.853 --> 08:08.552
translation, demanding--

08:08.554 --> 08:11.088
an across-the-board
“no settlements” policy

08:11.090 --> 08:13.691
on civil suits
against police officers.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.860
GARRETT: A single narcotics
officer, Omar Allen,

08:15.862 --> 08:18.029
has a grand total
of 15 suits

08:18.031 --> 08:21.299
settled out for $524,000.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.734
The union wants to take a stand
on number 16.

08:23.736 --> 08:24.769
A perp claims

08:24.771 --> 08:26.003
that Detective Allen used

08:26.005 --> 08:26.971
excessive force

08:26.973 --> 08:28.940
during an arrest
and hurt his back.

08:28.942 --> 08:32.443
Allen swears he never touched
the guy, that he's faking it.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.812
Well, how do know
the guy's faking?

08:34.813 --> 08:36.514
I'll get your tea now, my dear.
Thank you so much.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.115
These are killer,
by the way.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.384
You just dice some Virginia ham
right in with the batter.

08:40.385 --> 08:42.019
That's what it is?
Thanks, Pop.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.456
Um, the settlement dollars
don't come out of our budget.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.124
There's no financial advantage.

08:47.126 --> 08:50.728
So how do our officers benefit,
according to the union?

08:50.730 --> 08:53.064
GARRETT: The proposed policy
guarantees officers

08:53.066 --> 08:54.532
the right to a fair hearing

08:54.534 --> 08:57.201
instead of automatically
doling out money for...

08:57.203 --> 08:58.436
Not to interrupt,

08:58.438 --> 09:01.372
but the union tried to pull
that tactic on me, too.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.140
I told them

09:03.142 --> 09:04.842
that a blanket policy
would never work.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.677
But there's
more factors now, Pop.

09:06.679 --> 09:09.447
Let's take Detective Allen
for instance.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.882
If he doesn't settle,

09:11.884 --> 09:15.319
the perp is gonna go public and
then everybody's gonna wonder

09:15.321 --> 09:17.621
why a cop with 15
other civil suits

09:17.623 --> 09:19.190
is still on the job.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.891
Not good for Allen

09:20.893 --> 09:22.259
or the department.

09:22.261 --> 09:23.461
Amen to that, Commissioner.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.295
(chuckles)

09:24.297 --> 09:25.663
I mean Henry. I'm sorry.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.598
No. “Commissioner” is correct.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.532
It is?

09:28.534 --> 09:29.800
Absolutely. Commissioner,

09:29.802 --> 09:31.869
why don't you just sit down
and join us.

09:31.871 --> 09:35.606
Anyone needs anything,
I'll be in the kitchen.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.279
All right, we're here.

09:42.281 --> 09:44.448
Come on, TJ.

09:44.450 --> 09:48.386
If this housing is temporary,
what-what happens to me next?

09:48.388 --> 09:50.421
Depends if you stay
in New York or not.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.523
ACS is reaching out to
Social Services in Baltimore,

09:52.525 --> 09:54.091
they reached out
to your Mom...

09:54.093 --> 09:56.827
No, you-you can't call my mom.

09:56.829 --> 09:58.763
She's got enough troubles
already. Please.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.264
All right, look, TJ,

10:00.266 --> 10:02.266
we're assigning
a detective to the case.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.668
Okay? We're gonna find out
what happened to Christy.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.037
People disappear
for all kinds of reasons,

10:06.039 --> 10:07.838
so I don't want you
to lose hope yet.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.807
Give me a break.

10:09.809 --> 10:12.510
Not gonna help me or my aunt.

10:12.512 --> 10:15.546
Just gonna dump me here
and dump me there.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.848
I'm better off on the street.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.051
Well, you're not
running away, okay?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.352
You gonna stop me?

10:22.355 --> 10:23.988
I don't need any of you!
Hey, hey!

10:23.990 --> 10:25.589
All right, listen!

10:25.591 --> 10:28.192
If Ghost did this,
then we're gonna get him.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.829
And nobody's
dumping you anywhere.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.931
I promise.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.769
Come on.

10:40.506 --> 10:43.641
Man and mistress or
father and daughter?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.343
Mistress. No one would ever
take their daughter here.

10:46.345 --> 10:49.413
I don't think there's a couple
in here that wants to be seen.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.449
How do you even know
about a place like this?

10:51.451 --> 10:53.451
I worked for a
P.I. for a year.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.386
Did a lot of
divorce work.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.089
I tailed many an
adulterer here.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.990
Best fra diavolo
in the city.

10:59.992 --> 11:03.627
Well, you've had quite the rise,
Mr. McCoy, haven't you?

11:03.629 --> 11:06.530
What about her?

11:07.967 --> 11:09.066
Civilian or pro?

11:09.068 --> 11:10.968
You are so bad.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.604
I wonder what
they're all saying about us.

11:13.606 --> 11:16.807
They're saying, “Those people
look dynamite together.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.409
“They're obviously
soul mates.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.544
I wonder what
they're hiding from”"

11:22.648 --> 11:24.048
I was just joking.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.717
I don't want you to feel like
I'm pressuring you or...

11:26.719 --> 11:28.285
It's not that.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.554
What is it then?

11:31.958 --> 11:34.024
I know we're not supposed
to talk about work,

11:34.026 --> 11:37.161
but did Evan Beck talk to you
today about the Kowalski case?

11:37.163 --> 11:40.831
You're right,
we shouldn't talk about work.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.100
I will take that as a yes.

11:43.102 --> 11:45.402
You denied his request, right?

11:45.404 --> 11:47.404
He made some good points, Erin.

11:47.406 --> 11:49.406
I <i> am</i> thinking
about replacing you.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.308
Are you kidding me?
You have a difficult

11:51.310 --> 11:53.611
history with him,
and because the defendant

11:53.613 --> 11:55.846
is a corrections officer,
it's a sensitive case.

11:55.848 --> 11:59.383
I have been completely fair
and impartial with Evan Beck.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.519
This isn't about your integrity,
it's about...

12:01.521 --> 12:03.254
There was
heroin, cocaine,

12:03.256 --> 12:05.556
marijuana and oxy
in Thomas Kowalski's car.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.825
Obviously, it wasn't
for personal use.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.894
There's not
a prosecutor anywhere

12:09.896 --> 12:11.962
who would plead out.
Then Hampton won't either.

12:11.964 --> 12:13.230
Hampton?

12:16.102 --> 12:18.636
So you're not thinking
of replacing me,

12:18.638 --> 12:20.004
you've already done it.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.438
I'm sorry.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.141
It was a judgment call,
and I made it.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.777
You have too many
cases as it is.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.412
I thought you'd be thanking me.

12:29.815 --> 12:33.083
But this isn't just any case,
is it, Bobby?

12:51.600 --> 12:53.525
So, let me see if
I got this straight.

12:53.526 --> 12:56.194
You want to stay in
the city in an apartment

12:56.196 --> 12:57.862
with your friends
during the week?

12:57.864 --> 12:59.697
No, not all week.

12:59.699 --> 13:02.133
Just on the days
when I have 16-hour tours.

13:02.135 --> 13:03.701
No. No way.

13:03.703 --> 13:04.902
I know you're
working hard,

13:04.904 --> 13:07.505
but you're never home as it is.

13:07.507 --> 13:10.241
And the kids need you,
especially Jack.

13:10.243 --> 13:12.243
That's why I'm doing this,
for Jack!

13:12.245 --> 13:13.811
You want me to work

13:13.813 --> 13:16.114
all this overtime
so I could pay for tutors

13:16.116 --> 13:17.248
and all this bull crap.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.050
You can't have it both ways.
Bull crap?

13:19.052 --> 13:21.319
So, what, we're not supposed
to help him?

13:21.321 --> 13:22.720
That's not what I meant, okay?

13:22.722 --> 13:24.856
Can you just understand
that I'm freakin' exhausted?

13:24.858 --> 13:26.891
I mean, what do you
want me to do?

13:26.893 --> 13:29.060
Would you like me to crash
because I fell asleep

13:29.062 --> 13:31.062
at the wheel
on my way home from work,

13:31.064 --> 13:33.598
or I had a heart attack
on the job? I need rest!

13:33.600 --> 13:35.032
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

13:35.034 --> 13:36.034
Do what you want.

13:36.035 --> 13:37.835
Wow.

13:37.837 --> 13:39.871
Well, that's a real blessing.

13:39.873 --> 13:41.939
You know what, you're just
gonna find some excuse

13:41.941 --> 13:43.207
to stay away anyway.

13:43.209 --> 13:44.609
Is that what you really think?

13:44.611 --> 13:47.311
You shut me out of everything,
Danny. We never talk.

13:47.313 --> 13:48.713
We talk about everything.

13:48.715 --> 13:50.181
We talk everything to death.

13:50.183 --> 13:53.050
No, I talk <i> at</i> you

13:53.052 --> 13:55.853
while you're drinking a beer
or you're watching the TV.

13:55.855 --> 13:57.822
But I need a partner in this.

13:57.824 --> 13:59.991
I'm trying to be
your partner, Linda.

13:59.993 --> 14:02.927
Really? So you've spoken
to Jack about this, huh?

14:02.929 --> 14:05.863
Have you even sat down
and done homework with him once?

14:05.865 --> 14:08.733
I didn't even go over my own
homework when I was in school!

14:08.735 --> 14:10.001
I'm not the homework guy.

14:10.003 --> 14:12.270
So what kind of guy
are you then?

14:12.272 --> 14:14.639
Guy who only sees his family
during RDOs?

14:14.641 --> 14:16.841
Guy who pulls away
when things get tough?

14:16.843 --> 14:19.043
That the kind of guy
you are, Danny?

14:19.045 --> 14:20.344
You're being very unfair, okay?

14:20.346 --> 14:22.480
We're talking about
one or two nights a week here,

14:22.482 --> 14:24.215
and you are busting my balls
for nothing.

14:24.217 --> 14:25.217
MAN:
Excuse me, Linda?

14:25.218 --> 14:27.051
We're ready.

14:27.053 --> 14:28.286
Great.

14:28.288 --> 14:30.488
Good morning, Doc.

14:32.325 --> 14:35.493
Drugs they found in my car
were mine, Your Honor,

14:35.495 --> 14:37.228
for my own personal use.

14:38.698 --> 14:40.765
I take full responsibility,
and I'm looking forward

14:40.767 --> 14:43.534
to putting my life
back in order.

14:43.536 --> 14:44.836
Congratulations, Mr. Kowalski,

14:44.838 --> 14:46.904
you have successfully
pleaded guilty

14:46.906 --> 14:49.106
to possession
of narcotics.

14:49.108 --> 14:50.341
The sentencing guidelines
will be

14:50.343 --> 14:51.442
as stipulated in the agreement.

14:51.444 --> 14:53.778
You will surrender
to begin your sentence

14:53.780 --> 14:55.179
in 30 days.

14:56.249 --> 14:58.449
(gallery murmuring)

15:12.432 --> 15:14.198
Bobby.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.633
You let Kowalski plead.

15:15.635 --> 15:17.568
You gave them
everything they wanted.

15:17.570 --> 15:19.237
Good morning
to you, too, Erin.

15:19.239 --> 15:21.672
Well, what happened?
Did you not find any evidence

15:21.674 --> 15:23.674
that he was dealing?
My understanding is

15:23.676 --> 15:25.676
the evidence didn't support
the greater charge.

15:25.678 --> 15:26.911
Your understanding?

15:26.913 --> 15:29.046
Alex McBride told me he
had really good leads.

15:29.048 --> 15:31.182
I'd like to see that investigator's
report for myself.

15:31.184 --> 15:32.783
Why?

15:32.785 --> 15:34.151
You're off the case now.

15:34.153 --> 15:35.519
You don't need that information.

15:35.521 --> 15:38.422
What information? You said
there was no information.

15:38.424 --> 15:42.193
I don't understand your
obsession with this case, Erin.

15:42.195 --> 15:43.761
And I don't understand yours.

15:43.763 --> 15:47.732
What is the D.A. for the City
of New York doing sitting in

15:47.734 --> 15:49.567
on a routine plea deal?
Here's another question.

15:49.569 --> 15:52.303
How is a working stiff
like Thomas Kowalski

15:52.305 --> 15:56.073
affording a... a high-priced
mouthpiece like Evan Beck?

15:56.075 --> 15:57.808
I don't know
what you're getting at.

15:57.810 --> 15:59.977
Thomas Kowalski lost
his union job at Rikers Island,

15:59.979 --> 16:01.846
his family won't get
any of his pension,

16:01.848 --> 16:04.515
even though he was on the job
and vested for 15 years,

16:04.517 --> 16:07.485
and the man is going to jail
for a minimum of six months.

16:07.487 --> 16:09.120
I...
I think that justice

16:09.122 --> 16:11.489
has been done.

16:11.491 --> 16:15.159
I have to go to a meeting now,
but we can discuss this later.

16:16.529 --> 16:18.763
Or we can discuss
anything else--

16:18.765 --> 16:21.098
which I would greatly prefer.

16:23.169 --> 16:25.102
(sighs)

16:25.104 --> 16:27.538
Look, Erin...

16:27.540 --> 16:31.509
I've obviously offended you,
and I apologize, okay?

16:31.511 --> 16:35.513
But can you please trust
that I know how to do my job?

16:35.515 --> 16:37.548
(elevator bell dings)

16:45.024 --> 16:46.590
(dialing)

16:47.427 --> 16:48.626
Alex, it's Erin Reagan.

16:48.628 --> 16:50.428
I need to see
your investigator's report

16:50.430 --> 16:53.064
on the Kowalski case, ASAP.

16:53.066 --> 16:55.166
Call me.

17:03.676 --> 17:05.742
Glad you're on this, Danny.

17:05.744 --> 17:08.479
We were next up, kid.
Just worked out that way.

17:08.481 --> 17:10.481
Your brother's like
a 7-Eleven these days--

17:10.483 --> 17:12.450
open 24/7, 365.

17:12.452 --> 17:14.518
That's funny.

17:16.255 --> 17:18.789
Hey, I'm looking
for Lisa Kelly.

17:18.790 --> 17:21.425
You know, technically, you don't
even really have to be here.

17:21.426 --> 17:24.194
Yeah, well, I told the kid I'd
keep my hand in, you know, so...

17:24.196 --> 17:26.731
Did you really need
to bring pizza?

17:26.733 --> 17:27.897
What is your problem?

17:27.900 --> 17:29.667
You once told me
you can't save every puppy

17:29.669 --> 17:31.936
in the pound, and now you're the
one that's getting too close.

17:31.938 --> 17:33.355
Yeah, well,
that's my business, Eddie.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.008
Yeah, but you're making it
my business though.

17:35.032 --> 17:35.774
DANNY: Hey, hey.

17:35.775 --> 17:38.242
Only married couples get to
bicker like 12-year-olds, okay?

17:38.244 --> 17:39.710
So knock it off.

17:39.712 --> 17:40.745
Detective.

17:40.747 --> 17:42.747
You must be
here for TJ.

17:42.749 --> 17:44.415
I'm Lisa Kelly,
the administrator.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.617
Uh, which one
of you is Jamie?

17:46.619 --> 17:48.019
That's me.

17:48.021 --> 17:50.054
Ah. He talks about you.

17:50.056 --> 17:52.289
Let's leave
the pizza here.

17:52.291 --> 17:54.025
I'll make sure
everyone gets some.

17:54.027 --> 17:56.060
Hmm.

17:56.062 --> 17:57.395
How'd you get him
to do that?

17:57.397 --> 17:59.530
With tough kids
like TJ,

17:59.532 --> 18:01.599
the trick is to put
them in charge.

18:01.601 --> 18:04.135
He's great
with the little ones.

18:04.137 --> 18:05.936
This way.

18:08.875 --> 18:10.574
This is Detective Reagan
and this is Detective Baez.

18:10.576 --> 18:12.376
They're gonna be handling
your case, okay?

18:12.378 --> 18:14.678
Reagan. That's your name.

18:14.680 --> 18:15.913
Yeah, this is my older brother.

18:15.915 --> 18:17.882
Figured we'd keep
it in the family.

18:17.884 --> 18:21.819
“Detective.” Guess he got
the looks and the brains, huh?

18:22.822 --> 18:24.622
I like this kid.

18:24.624 --> 18:27.958
Okay, so all of these guys
have the street name “Ghost.”

18:27.960 --> 18:29.260
Just let us know

18:29.262 --> 18:31.395
if anyone of them resemble
your aunt's boyfriend.

18:31.397 --> 18:33.597
And it's okay
if they don't.

18:37.870 --> 18:39.537
That's him.

18:39.539 --> 18:41.205
That's Ghost.

18:41.207 --> 18:44.642
You sure?
I'd know that tweeker anywhere.

18:44.644 --> 18:46.310
Yeah, we know him, too.

18:46.312 --> 18:47.645
He's a bad guy.

18:47.647 --> 18:49.013
Yeah, he is.

18:49.015 --> 18:50.314
We're gonna get him, TJ.

18:50.316 --> 18:52.316
I want to come.
No.

18:52.318 --> 18:54.585
You just got to let us
do our jobs.

18:54.587 --> 18:57.088
Better come back and tell
me what happens, Jamie.

18:57.090 --> 18:58.355
Yeah, of course I'll come back.

18:58.357 --> 19:01.358
Just sit tight,
all right?

19:04.597 --> 19:06.897
You may want to listen
to your partner.

19:06.899 --> 19:07.899
What?

19:07.900 --> 19:09.400
Just be careful,
okay?

19:09.402 --> 19:10.935
Yeah.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.580
Thanks for
seeing me, Alex.

19:22.582 --> 19:24.048
Of course.
You want something?

19:24.050 --> 19:25.416
No, I'm good.

19:25.418 --> 19:26.617
Here's the report,

19:26.619 --> 19:29.320
but I warn you,
there's not much here.

19:29.322 --> 19:31.021
Why not?
It was pled out

19:31.023 --> 19:32.389
before I could really dig in.

19:32.391 --> 19:33.958
Let me give you
the highlights.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.527
Five corrections officers
from C block on Rikers Island

19:36.529 --> 19:37.795
are under investigation

19:37.797 --> 19:39.230
by the Department
of Corrections.

19:39.232 --> 19:40.998
Thomas Kowalski is one of them.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.500
Investigation for what?

19:42.502 --> 19:44.902
That's the $64,000 question.

19:44.904 --> 19:46.337
The first three
were lawyered up

19:46.339 --> 19:47.705
and wouldn't speak to me.

19:47.707 --> 19:50.241
Let me guess. Evan Beck?

19:50.243 --> 19:52.243
Yes. He represents them all.

19:52.245 --> 19:55.613
And when I called the
fourth officer, Wesley Davis,

19:55.615 --> 19:56.881
his widow answered.

19:56.883 --> 19:58.482
Widow?

19:58.484 --> 19:59.517
Yeah.

19:59.519 --> 20:01.952
He killed himself
in the middle of this.

20:01.954 --> 20:04.755
Did you interview Mrs. Davis,
find out what happened

20:04.757 --> 20:06.023
on the job?

20:06.025 --> 20:07.691
Why not?

20:09.395 --> 20:10.628
Look, Erin,

20:10.630 --> 20:13.063
I've been an investigator
for the D.A.'s office

20:13.065 --> 20:15.599
for almost 12 years--
eight different regimes.

20:15.601 --> 20:17.134
Do you know how I survived?

20:17.136 --> 20:18.602
I know when to lay off.

20:18.604 --> 20:20.938
You and I have been
through some wars together,

20:20.940 --> 20:22.373
really pushed
the envelope,

20:22.375 --> 20:24.742
but you need to lay off
on this one, too.

20:24.744 --> 20:26.977
The players are just too big.

20:26.979 --> 20:28.913
Which players are those?

20:28.915 --> 20:31.282
The Commissioner for
the Department of Corrections.

20:31.284 --> 20:33.617
The D.A. himself.
McCoy?

20:34.587 --> 20:37.354
What's his connection
to the D.O.C.?

20:37.356 --> 20:39.123
(sighs)

20:39.125 --> 20:41.225
What the hell is going on here?

20:41.227 --> 20:42.993
Don't know.
And I don't want to know.

20:42.995 --> 20:44.028
Come on, Alex.

20:44.030 --> 20:45.462
It's just the two of us.

20:45.464 --> 20:46.564
What do you think?

20:46.566 --> 20:48.132
Kowalski was found
with drugs,

20:48.134 --> 20:49.900
every guard on
his cell block

20:49.902 --> 20:52.436
is being investigated.
The obvious...

20:52.438 --> 20:54.538
We can't try Kowalski again,
so what does it matter?

20:54.540 --> 20:56.540
Let's live to fight
another day.

20:56.542 --> 20:57.875
This is my fight.

20:57.877 --> 21:01.245
I need to know the truth,
for a lot of reasons.

21:04.617 --> 21:06.917
You be careful, Erin.

21:17.196 --> 21:18.562
(door closes)

21:18.564 --> 21:19.964
Hi, Pop.

21:19.966 --> 21:21.966
Hello.

21:27.340 --> 21:29.306
(clears throat)

21:33.045 --> 21:35.913
What put a bug in your pants?

21:35.915 --> 21:37.014
Get off your feet.

21:37.016 --> 21:38.749
My weight's not on it.

21:38.751 --> 21:40.551
Go back to your chair.

21:40.553 --> 21:42.453
Answer my question first.

21:42.455 --> 21:45.322
A little respect for me
in front of your brass--

21:45.324 --> 21:47.124
is that too much to ask?

21:47.126 --> 21:49.126
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:49.128 --> 21:52.896
That crack you made about
addressing me as Commissioner.

21:52.898 --> 21:55.599
Well, that wasn't a crack.
It's a fact.

21:55.601 --> 21:59.370
Proper protocol is to address
a former PC as Commissioner.

21:59.372 --> 22:00.372
I know that.

22:00.373 --> 22:01.805
Well, then what's your beef?

22:01.807 --> 22:02.840
The way you said it.

22:02.842 --> 22:05.643
I didn't say it in any way.

22:05.645 --> 22:07.645
And pretending
to ask me to sit in

22:07.647 --> 22:09.446
with that put-upon
tone of voice.

22:09.448 --> 22:11.682
I <i> was</i> asking you to sit in.

22:11.684 --> 22:13.217
You got it all wrong, Pop.

22:13.219 --> 22:15.753
Of course I've got it all wrong.
That's what I do.

22:15.755 --> 22:17.488
No, just in this instance.

22:17.490 --> 22:20.491
Look, I'm not gonna
apologize for speaking up

22:20.493 --> 22:22.626
on issues that I know
something about.

22:22.628 --> 22:25.329
And if I got excited because
we had some company in the house

22:25.331 --> 22:28.799
for a change, I'm not gonna
apologize for that either.

22:28.801 --> 22:30.734
Where are you going?

22:30.736 --> 22:31.602
Out.

22:31.604 --> 22:34.438
Out. What are you, 16?

22:34.440 --> 22:36.940
The takeout menus are
in the drawer by the fridge.

22:39.578 --> 22:41.745
(sighs)

22:44.917 --> 22:47.818
(car alarm wailing)

23:07.907 --> 23:10.140
Hi, this is ADA Erin Reagan.

23:10.142 --> 23:12.576
My car was just broken into
and my briefcase was stolen.

23:12.578 --> 23:14.878
I'm gonna need some assistance.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.047
Yes, I'll hold.

23:35.768 --> 23:37.401
You got something, Mel?

23:37.403 --> 23:39.136
All right, listen,
before I say anything,

23:39.138 --> 23:40.938
I got to know
this makes us even.

23:40.940 --> 23:42.873
You can't keep
bothering me.

23:42.875 --> 23:44.074
Even for what?

23:44.076 --> 23:46.543
Man, I stole a TV
way back in the Giuliani era.

23:46.545 --> 23:48.545
Your partner here, she let
me go, and she's-she's

23:48.547 --> 23:49.913
owned my ass ever since.

23:49.915 --> 23:52.249
My partner?
Yeah, man,

23:52.251 --> 23:54.051
your partner. She might
bat her eyes and look pretty,

23:54.053 --> 23:55.719
but I'm telling you,
it's better to be locked up

23:55.721 --> 23:56.987
than owe this girl a favor.

23:57.823 --> 23:59.923
All right, we're even.

23:59.925 --> 24:02.626
Man, you're my witness,
all right? You heard her.

24:02.628 --> 24:04.161
Hey, whatever she says.
She's the boss.

24:04.163 --> 24:05.396
I'm just saying.

24:05.398 --> 24:07.030
Okay, give it up.
What'd you get?

24:07.032 --> 24:08.399
All right.

24:08.401 --> 24:10.868
Here's where Ghost is.

24:10.870 --> 24:12.703
But, Detective,

24:12.705 --> 24:15.539
I'd have my gun out
if I was you.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.474
This dude is crazy.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.100
Police!

24:43.102 --> 24:44.568
Everybody stay where you are,

24:44.570 --> 24:46.770
keep your hands
where we can see them!

24:51.811 --> 24:54.011
Go.

24:57.082 --> 24:59.283
One, two.

25:12.932 --> 25:15.199
♪ ♪

25:28.414 --> 25:30.180
(grunts)

25:46.532 --> 25:47.731
(choking)

25:51.270 --> 25:53.604
(coughing)

25:53.606 --> 25:56.206
You good?

25:56.208 --> 25:57.875
Yeah.

25:57.877 --> 26:00.277
(panting)

26:15.016 --> 26:16.063
(door closes)

26:16.867 --> 26:18.734
Hey, Grandpa.

26:18.736 --> 26:21.470
Hey, sweetie.

26:21.472 --> 26:24.139
How's the ankle?
Perfect.

26:24.141 --> 26:26.108
Was it a random act

26:26.110 --> 26:28.677
or do you think it's connected
to one of your cases?

26:28.679 --> 26:32.281
“Reagan” winds up on a police
report, tends to get back to me.

26:32.283 --> 26:34.416
And when were you gonna
tell me about your car?

26:34.418 --> 26:36.184
It's nothing I can't handle.

26:36.186 --> 26:37.419
That's not what I asked.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.655
Dad, please. I don't need you
looking after me.

26:39.657 --> 26:41.557
Well, then alert Mr. McCoy.

26:41.559 --> 26:44.593
If it's about work, there's
protection he can provide.

26:44.595 --> 26:46.762
Right. Mr. McCoy,
your favorite person.

26:46.764 --> 26:49.565
Yeah, he and I got off
to a rocky start.

26:49.567 --> 26:52.234
Why won't you tell me
what's going on?

26:52.236 --> 26:54.336
HENRY:
Dinner's ready.

26:56.974 --> 26:58.840
(sighs)

27:01.679 --> 27:04.346
I know I never do this,
but I'd like to say grace today,

27:04.348 --> 27:05.781
if that's all right
with everyone.

27:05.783 --> 27:08.650
You got it.

27:10.287 --> 27:14.590
Just want to say how blessed
we are to have this food,

27:14.592 --> 27:16.558
this house,

27:16.560 --> 27:18.794
four generations of Reagans
sitting around this table.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.998
We should never
take that for granted.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.499
That's an order.

27:24.501 --> 27:27.002
Amen.
Well said, Jamie.

27:27.004 --> 27:28.737
ERIN:
What's with wearing

27:28.739 --> 27:30.038
your heart on
your sleeve today?

27:30.040 --> 27:31.540
DANNY:
Jamie's playing big brother

27:31.542 --> 27:34.209
to this kid-- this homeless kid.

27:34.211 --> 27:35.844
TJ's 13 years old,
he's been bounced around

27:35.846 --> 27:37.412
from family member
to family member.

27:37.414 --> 27:39.247
He doesn't even
have the basics--

27:39.249 --> 27:41.416
regular meals with
a roof over his head,

27:41.418 --> 27:43.452
so... it was humbling.

27:43.454 --> 27:44.720
Does he go to school?

27:44.722 --> 27:47.356
Yeah, he did in Baltimore
a little bit, but his aunt,

27:47.358 --> 27:49.391
who was taking care of him
here, hasn't enrolled him.

27:49.393 --> 27:52.060
Well, doesn't she care about him?
Yeah,

27:52.062 --> 27:53.996
but I don't think she can really
take care of herself, Sean.

27:53.998 --> 27:57.566
Family is the original
Department of Health, Education

27:57.568 --> 27:59.968
and Welfare.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.504
If that starts to fall apart,
everything goes to hell.

28:02.506 --> 28:03.972
Amen to that, too.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.641
What kind of case is it?

28:05.643 --> 28:06.742
His aunt disappeared.

28:06.744 --> 28:08.577
We're looking into
every possibility.

28:08.579 --> 28:10.045
Even murder, right, Danny?

28:10.047 --> 28:12.280
Right.
Oh, man.

28:12.282 --> 28:13.949
That's a kid with
much bigger problems

28:13.951 --> 28:15.717
to worry about than
just his grades.

28:15.719 --> 28:18.320
Yeah, well, we can only have the
problems that we have, Danny.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.055
DANNY: Yeah, we could
also have a little bit

28:20.057 --> 28:21.556
of perspective, can't we, Linda?

28:21.558 --> 28:23.358
Well there's perspective
and then there's denial.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.160
You really want
to get into this now?

28:25.162 --> 28:26.795
Who knows when else
I'm gonna see you?

28:26.797 --> 28:30.198
Ding. Back to your corners.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.767
Pass the potatoes, please.

28:39.076 --> 28:42.644
I just want to crash in the
city a few nights a week.

28:42.646 --> 28:44.913
Linda's worried
about Jack and is now

28:44.915 --> 28:47.516
making a global
event out of it.

28:47.518 --> 28:50.485
Temperatures seem pretty high.

28:50.487 --> 28:53.088
(sighs)
Maybe she's right.

28:53.090 --> 28:55.223
Maybe there are
other reasons

28:55.225 --> 28:57.559
that I don't want to
come home. I don't know.

28:59.263 --> 29:03.031
No marriage is perfect.
Most aren't even close.

29:03.033 --> 29:05.500
Yours and Mom's
seemed pretty close.

29:08.472 --> 29:10.539
Your mother and I used to fight

29:10.541 --> 29:12.307
in the bathroom
with the shower running

29:12.309 --> 29:15.143
so you guys wouldn't hear.

29:15.145 --> 29:17.579
We had our struggles,
too, believe me.

29:17.581 --> 29:20.348
When was this?

29:20.350 --> 29:23.318
Over the years, on and off,

29:23.320 --> 29:25.087
in equal measure.

29:25.089 --> 29:29.424
How'd you two manage
to hold it together?

29:33.263 --> 29:35.297
She put up with a lot.

29:35.299 --> 29:37.232
And I...

29:37.234 --> 29:40.535
eventually just shut up
and listened to her.

29:40.537 --> 29:42.671
She was right.

29:44.441 --> 29:46.575
The family had to be
the center of my life,

29:46.577 --> 29:51.346
or everything else was just
trying to fill a vacuum.

29:51.348 --> 29:53.682
And later,

29:53.684 --> 29:55.884
when she got sick...

29:57.654 --> 30:00.822
...I was grateful
for every moment we had.

30:15.139 --> 30:16.671
Thanks for doing
this, Alex.

30:16.673 --> 30:18.273
They crossed the line
when they broke into your car.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.342
All bets are off now.

30:22.179 --> 30:23.812
Thank you for seeing
me, Mrs. Davis.

30:23.814 --> 30:26.448
I'm sorry to hear
about your husband.

30:26.450 --> 30:29.151
Can you tell me
what happened?

30:29.153 --> 30:30.952
What went wrong
on the job?

30:30.954 --> 30:33.321
Thomas Kowalski.

30:33.323 --> 30:35.123
That's what went wrong.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.725
Everything was fine

30:36.727 --> 30:38.660
until he transferred
to C Block.

30:38.662 --> 30:41.930
Forced Wesley
into the whole thing.

30:41.932 --> 30:43.732
It was his fault.

30:43.734 --> 30:45.367
What was Kowalski's fault?

30:45.369 --> 30:47.435
Why was your husband
being investigated?

30:47.437 --> 30:49.371
Those correction officers

30:49.373 --> 30:51.640
were selling drugs
to the prisoners.

30:51.642 --> 30:54.409
Heroin, coke,
oxy, weed.

30:54.411 --> 30:56.278
They were even smuggling in
weapons and letting them

30:56.280 --> 30:58.280
have sex with women
from the outside.

30:58.282 --> 31:00.982
You name it, it was for sale.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.685
My husband wasn't
down with that.

31:03.687 --> 31:06.121
He just wanted to do his job.

31:06.123 --> 31:08.423
Did Wesley report them?

31:08.425 --> 31:10.258
Yeah, he wanted to.

31:10.260 --> 31:13.195
But Kowalski
kept threatening him.

31:15.632 --> 31:17.966
He just cracked.

31:29.246 --> 31:31.780
DANNY: So you killed her
for the money meant for TJ.

31:31.782 --> 31:34.482
If I killed Christy
and stole $2,500,

31:34.484 --> 31:36.484
why would I be staying
at that squat?

31:36.486 --> 31:38.486
And why wouldn't
you have found the money?

31:38.488 --> 31:40.288
Here come the hypotheticals.

31:40.290 --> 31:41.857
GHOST:
Come on.

31:41.859 --> 31:44.292
Have I lawyered up?
Been anything but cooperative

31:44.294 --> 31:45.460
on the other charges?

31:45.462 --> 31:47.562
No. Besides trying
to murder my partner,

31:47.564 --> 31:49.264
you've been a real stand-up guy.

31:49.266 --> 31:52.200
I was so high I don't
even remember doing that.

31:52.202 --> 31:54.336
Really? I hope you
got a better defense

31:54.338 --> 31:55.737
than that for
Christy Stewart.

31:55.739 --> 31:59.074
Look, you got enough to put me
under the jail already,

31:59.076 --> 32:01.543
but I didn't
kill that woman, I swear.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.144
And why the hell
should we believe you?

32:03.146 --> 32:05.413
Let me have my phone.

32:05.415 --> 32:07.482
I can prove it to you.

32:07.484 --> 32:09.618
I'll call her.

32:22.332 --> 32:24.499
That's it? Go ahead.

32:24.501 --> 32:27.068
Ma'am? I have your towels.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.805
Get out of here.

32:30.807 --> 32:33.341
Christy Stewart?
Who the hell are you?

32:33.343 --> 32:35.944
Police. You're under arrest
for felony child abandonment.

32:35.946 --> 32:39.014
Who did I abandon?
Is this about TJ?

32:39.016 --> 32:40.515
BAEZ: You have the right
to remain silent.

32:40.517 --> 32:41.850
Anything you do say...
Stop.

32:41.852 --> 32:44.619
Stop reading me my rights.
I'm not his guardian.

32:44.621 --> 32:45.954
No? Then why'd
his mother give you

32:45.956 --> 32:47.756
money to take care of him?
Yeah.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.357
And why'd you spend it on this?

32:49.359 --> 32:50.725
It's money I was owed.

32:50.727 --> 32:52.494
She's always dumping
that kid on me.

32:52.496 --> 32:55.497
It's why I moved to New York
in the first place.

32:55.499 --> 32:57.632
So you just leave a 13-year-old
kid in the streets,

32:57.634 --> 32:58.900
thinking that you're dead?

32:58.902 --> 33:01.403
That boy loves you.

33:01.405 --> 33:03.038
TJ's not my son.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.406
I shouldn't have
to raise him.

33:04.408 --> 33:06.408
BAEZ: Let's go.
You know,

33:06.410 --> 33:08.977
this really sucks. Can I at
least put my clothes on first?

33:08.979 --> 33:10.345
BAEZ: Yeah,
we'll grab them.

33:10.347 --> 33:13.181
I hope TJ's happy now.

33:29.297 --> 33:31.097
You taking off?

33:31.099 --> 33:33.533
I'm gonna go check
that apartment out finally.

33:33.535 --> 33:36.235
You mind if I tag along?

33:36.237 --> 33:37.804
I... I'm curious.

33:37.806 --> 33:40.173
Curious or suspicious?

33:40.175 --> 33:41.808
Look, if you don't
want me to go...

33:41.810 --> 33:44.343
No, hey, knock yourself out.

33:48.049 --> 33:50.483
DANNY:
<i>My wife's so mad,</i>

33:50.485 --> 33:52.418
she's not even
speaking to me.

33:52.420 --> 33:54.620
My grandparents were
married for 57 years.

33:54.622 --> 33:57.356
Their secret was
to never go to sleep angry,

33:57.358 --> 33:59.492
even if you have
to stay up all night.

33:59.494 --> 34:01.627
Yeah, but if me and
my wife did that,

34:01.629 --> 34:03.062
we wouldn't sleep
for a week.

34:03.064 --> 34:06.165
Well, maybe that's
what you ought to do.

34:06.167 --> 34:09.835
(laughter, music playing)

34:11.139 --> 34:13.438
It's-it's not what
it looks like.

34:25.687 --> 34:27.587
You wanted to see me?

34:28.690 --> 34:31.757
You had Thomas Kowalski
rearrested?

34:31.759 --> 34:33.426
He smashed my car window
and stole my briefcase.

34:33.428 --> 34:35.061
What would you like me to do?

34:35.063 --> 34:36.795
Are you positive it was him?

34:36.797 --> 34:38.297
Luckily, my coffee place

34:38.299 --> 34:40.399
has state-of-the-art
security cameras.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.335
You can watch the whole thing
in HD if you'd like.

34:43.338 --> 34:44.704
What did he steal?

34:44.706 --> 34:46.038
Evidence--
but that doesn't matter.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.607
I already know everything.

34:47.609 --> 34:50.643
You're gonna have to slow down
a little, Erin.

34:50.645 --> 34:52.545
I'm running a few steps behind.

34:52.547 --> 34:54.112
I don't think you are, Bobby.

34:54.114 --> 34:56.748
You sure you don't want
to just come clean?

34:58.620 --> 34:59.752
Okay.

34:59.754 --> 35:01.587
I know about
the drug trafficking at Rikers

35:01.589 --> 35:04.056
and the D.O.C.'s attempts
to cover it up.

35:04.058 --> 35:06.259
I know about Wesley Davis
trying to stop it,

35:06.261 --> 35:07.593
but he killed
himself instead.

35:07.595 --> 35:11.364
And I know that if
the Kowalski case went to trial,

35:11.366 --> 35:13.566
the whole scandal would have
blown up and become public.

35:13.568 --> 35:15.401
Here's what I don't know.

35:15.403 --> 35:18.004
Why didn't you
want that to happen?

35:18.006 --> 35:21.741
Why would you risk your whole
career over something like this?

35:25.013 --> 35:27.079
I want to show you something.

35:27.081 --> 35:28.915
Come here.

35:31.786 --> 35:34.120
That's the Jersey Shore.

35:34.122 --> 35:37.023
Longer ago
than I care to admit.

35:37.025 --> 35:38.658
There's me in the middle.

35:38.660 --> 35:42.662
Eight-year-old
Bobby McCoy.

35:42.664 --> 35:44.363
On the right is my dad.

35:44.365 --> 35:46.332
And on the left...

35:46.334 --> 35:48.701
is Michael Amato.

35:48.703 --> 35:51.537
The Commissioner of the D.O.C.

35:51.539 --> 35:54.106
He was my father's best friend.

35:54.108 --> 35:56.642
When my dad passed...

35:56.644 --> 35:58.277
Mike became my father.

35:58.279 --> 36:00.546
In fact, he wrote one of
the key recommendations

36:00.548 --> 36:01.847
that got me this post.

36:01.849 --> 36:04.250
So, what, you felt like
you had to pay him back?

36:04.252 --> 36:06.519
No. He never asked me
for anything.

36:06.521 --> 36:09.355
Well, what did you know?
How much did you look away from?

36:09.357 --> 36:10.890
Look, Erin, all those C.O.s

36:10.892 --> 36:12.825
were already
under internal investigation.

36:12.827 --> 36:14.460
He was gonna fire them all,
revamp the whole

36:14.462 --> 36:16.629
security system--
a system that he inherited.

36:16.631 --> 36:19.265
Did he really deserve
to have the whole mess go public

36:19.267 --> 36:21.801
and cost him his job,
all because Thomas Kowalski

36:21.803 --> 36:23.202
ran a red light?

36:23.204 --> 36:24.270
That wasn't your call,

36:24.272 --> 36:26.472
and you know that.

36:30.812 --> 36:34.213
Look, I understand
your loyalty to a friend--

36:34.215 --> 36:37.183
I even admire it--
but you've abused

36:37.185 --> 36:38.951
the power of
this office.

36:38.953 --> 36:41.587
That's a serious
ethical violation, Bobby.

36:41.589 --> 36:44.824
What are you gonna do?

36:44.826 --> 36:47.994
No. What are <i> you</i> going to do?

36:51.432 --> 36:54.800
I have things
I want to accomplish here.

36:54.802 --> 36:58.704
And I'm just starting to see
eye to eye with your dad, too.

36:58.706 --> 37:00.906
I don't want to resign.

37:00.908 --> 37:03.709
Well, that's not up to me.

37:03.711 --> 37:07.179
What's gonna happen
to Mike Amato?

37:07.181 --> 37:09.982
I have to refer this

37:09.984 --> 37:12.318
to the Department
of Investigations.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.787
It's out of my hands.
I'm sorry.

37:19.894 --> 37:21.994
Are we still going out

37:21.996 --> 37:23.529
Saturday night?

37:23.531 --> 37:25.865
You were gonna pick the place.

37:25.867 --> 37:28.401
Please don't ask me that
right now.

37:39.180 --> 37:42.948
There really is no good way
to spin this, you know?

37:42.950 --> 37:45.251
Well, his aunt
is alive.

37:45.253 --> 37:47.019
That's good news.

37:47.021 --> 37:48.954
Yeah, but that just means
that she deserted him,

37:48.956 --> 37:51.257
and that might be harder
for TJ to take, right?

37:52.627 --> 37:54.160
JANKO:
Listen, tell him the truth.

37:54.162 --> 37:55.661
Okay? He deserves that.

37:55.663 --> 37:56.762
Yeah.

37:56.764 --> 37:59.365
Hey, TJ. Hey.

37:59.367 --> 38:01.200
We have some news about Christy.

38:01.202 --> 38:02.368
Why don't we...
why don't we sit down.

38:02.370 --> 38:04.637
Just... just tell me.

38:08.409 --> 38:10.376
We found her.
Is she okay?

38:10.378 --> 38:13.913
Yeah, but she's a little bit
sick right now, so...

38:13.915 --> 38:15.748
you can see her
when she's...

38:15.750 --> 38:17.750
when she's better.

38:17.752 --> 38:19.485
She's not sick.

38:19.487 --> 38:21.253
She just...

38:21.255 --> 38:22.788
doesn't want me, right?

38:22.790 --> 38:24.256
No, TJ...

38:24.258 --> 38:26.058
It's not cool to lie.

38:27.695 --> 38:30.629
It's not your fault.

38:30.631 --> 38:33.065
Christy just gets
a little wild sometimes,

38:33.067 --> 38:34.467
like my mom.

38:34.469 --> 38:35.801
Can't handle me.

38:35.803 --> 38:37.636
It's okay.

38:37.638 --> 38:39.739
You tell him.

38:39.741 --> 38:41.207
Tell me what?

38:41.209 --> 38:43.743
We didn't know what was
gonna happen with Christy,

38:43.745 --> 38:46.679
so we made other arrangements,
just in case.

38:46.681 --> 38:48.748
(sighs) Ms. Kelly's
gonna hook me up

38:48.750 --> 38:50.950
with a nice foster
family. Right?

38:50.952 --> 38:53.986
Yeah. They have young kids
in the house.

38:53.988 --> 38:57.823
They took one look at TJ and
knew he was the one they wanted.

38:57.825 --> 38:59.458
They need me over there.

38:59.460 --> 39:01.861
I'm... gonna help out.

39:01.863 --> 39:04.063
You sure you're ready
for that responsibility?

39:04.065 --> 39:07.266
Born ready, my man.

39:16.043 --> 39:18.077
What are you doing here?

39:18.079 --> 39:19.512
Everything okay?

39:19.514 --> 39:22.615
Yeah, everything's all right.

39:22.617 --> 39:24.450
You were right.

39:25.653 --> 39:27.286
The apartment's not for me.

39:27.288 --> 39:30.589
Though I don't think
our whole lives

39:30.591 --> 39:34.260
should revolve
around the kids either.

39:34.262 --> 39:36.996
Maybe there's a middle ground
we could find.

39:36.998 --> 39:38.631
Like?

39:38.633 --> 39:42.001
Like maybe just the two of us
on a long weekend, for starters.

39:42.003 --> 39:45.805
Just the two of us?

39:45.807 --> 39:47.072
That scare you?

39:47.074 --> 39:49.074
It's been a long time.

39:49.076 --> 39:51.076
Six, maybe seven years.

39:51.078 --> 39:52.478
At least.

39:52.480 --> 39:53.779
Too long.

39:53.781 --> 39:57.082
Or not long enough.

39:59.420 --> 40:01.887
It's too long.

40:01.889 --> 40:03.422
(whispers):
I agree.

40:07.261 --> 40:09.762
What are you doing?

40:09.764 --> 40:11.964
Checking availability at Mohonk.

40:11.966 --> 40:14.266
You know, somebody's
got to plan this thing.

40:14.268 --> 40:16.936
We know it's not gonna be you.

40:18.739 --> 40:20.639
That's funny.

40:20.641 --> 40:21.907
(chuckles)

40:26.113 --> 40:27.947
Get out of here.

40:37.425 --> 40:42.528
The NYPD Corporation Council
has advised against

40:42.530 --> 40:46.131
the union demand

40:46.133 --> 40:49.235
for a blanket
no-settlement policy

40:49.237 --> 40:51.270
for civil suits.

40:51.272 --> 40:52.972
I concurred.

40:56.010 --> 40:58.377
More accurately,

40:58.379 --> 41:00.779
you and I concurred.

41:02.650 --> 41:04.149
How's the ankle?

41:04.151 --> 41:05.818
Swelling's down.

41:05.820 --> 41:08.387
But, you know, I'm getting
kind of used to this.

41:08.389 --> 41:11.190
Think I'll give it another day
just for the hell of it.

41:20.268 --> 41:22.167
(sighs)

41:22.169 --> 41:24.370
Ask me one.

41:24.372 --> 41:27.206
Tuesday's puzzles
are easy.

41:28.576 --> 41:31.143
Okay.

41:34.815 --> 41:37.216
One day you're gonna
be sitting here.

41:37.218 --> 41:39.184
I'm sitting here right now.

41:39.186 --> 41:40.786
I mean retired.

41:40.788 --> 41:44.490
Still with a brain,
worthwhile opinions,

41:44.492 --> 41:47.726
maybe even some
valuable wisdom.

41:49.297 --> 41:52.731
I hope for you that whoever's
sitting where you are

41:52.733 --> 41:54.967
will appreciate that.

41:57.104 --> 41:59.705
Wonder who that'll be.

41:59.707 --> 42:01.140
Danny?

42:01.142 --> 42:03.542
(chuckles) You two
wouldn't last an hour.

42:03.544 --> 42:05.044
Erin.

42:05.046 --> 42:07.012
All that worry and fuss.

42:07.014 --> 42:09.281
Jamie.

42:09.283 --> 42:10.950
If you're lucky.

42:10.952 --> 42:12.384
(sighs)

42:12.386 --> 42:15.387
Lucky like you are?

42:22.596 --> 42:25.064
“The first Mrs. Jagger”.

42:25.066 --> 42:27.933
Six letters--
last one “A”.

42:27.935 --> 42:30.002
Bianca.

42:31.839 --> 42:33.672
Bianca.

42:35.943 --> 42:38.110
Thank you.
