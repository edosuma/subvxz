00:03.760 --> 00:05.000
Cass is chumming it up with Crowley.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.009
<i>They're hunting Lucifer. Together.</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.362
That's right,
one's an angel, one's a demon,

00:09.520 --> 00:11.170
and, apparently, they solve crimes.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.330
<i>So, Lucifer is now
the Master of Butt Rock.</i>

00:14.520 --> 00:15.885
<i>He jumped into Vince Vincente.</i>

00:16.120 --> 00:17.929
- SAM: <i>The rock star?</i>
- The douchebag.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.851
Guy used to roll with purple hair down
to his butt, and a spiked codpiece.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.088
- It was the '80s.
- What, you're defending him?

00:23.240 --> 00:26.961
No. I mean, his third album was kind of
not horrible.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.441
I hate you so much right now.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.090
I been around
all stripes of Vince, all right?

00:30.200 --> 00:31.440
Drunk Vince,
depressed Vince, megalomaniacal,

00:31.600 --> 00:33.648
<i>"I'm a Golden God" Vince.</i>

00:33.880 --> 00:35.769
<i>The Vince who
threw me through that door,</i>

00:36.040 --> 00:37.201
<i>that wasn't him.</i>

00:37.440 --> 00:40.125
If you hear from him,
don't hesitate to call.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.801
Okay, Agent BeyoncÃ©?

00:45.160 --> 00:47.003
LUCIFER:
<i>This vessel hopping is getting old.</i>

00:47.280 --> 00:50.045
Just as I get used to limitations
of one meat sack, I gotta

00:50.200 --> 00:52.726
cut bait and jump
through the next flawed lump.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.287
Then you want me to
make this vessel permanent?

00:55.440 --> 00:56.521
<i>Strong enough to hold you?</i>

00:56.720 --> 00:57.881
LUCIFER: <i>It does look good on me.</i>

01:07.360 --> 01:08.566
Red, what did you do?

01:08.760 --> 01:11.161
Sped up the decaying process, my lord.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.401
Ginger bitch!

01:13.080 --> 01:15.924
- You can't destroy me!
- Not yet.

01:16.320 --> 01:19.085
But I can send you far, far away.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.563
Try finding a new vessel
at the bottom of the bloody ocean.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.649
- Dark Lord. Beelzebub.
- Apollyon.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.041
As your humble servants, we beseech thee.

01:43.280 --> 01:45.567
We say your names as summonings.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.605
Show thyself! Serpent!

01:48.960 --> 01:51.042
- Devil!
- Lucifer!

01:51.360 --> 01:52.725
Show thyself!

01:53.160 --> 01:55.447
Rain your splendor upon me!

01:56.040 --> 01:59.362
Let me bathe in your unholy wrath!

02:00.960 --> 02:02.883
Drench me, Lucifer!

02:03.040 --> 02:05.168
Cut it out, Gordy.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.200
<i>Dude, it's not funny.</i>

02:12.600 --> 02:15.206
Dude, you asked Lucifer to drench you.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.401
I didn't write it, okay?

02:16.560 --> 02:19.643
It's a Satanist Society of America
approved summoning. I found it online.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.609
Yeah, like you found that artifact.

02:22.040 --> 02:24.327
Face it, Adam, your "Satan feather"

02:24.480 --> 02:26.926
is faker than my stepmom's
Chinatown Fendi.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.320
- It's real!
- It's a rock.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.290
Well, it's fossilized!
A feather from Lucifer's wing!

02:31.440 --> 02:33.568
The seller excavated it from
one of his crypts.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.883
Lucifer has crypts. Lucifer has wings.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.611
You're so freaking dumb.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.527
<i>Actually...</i>

02:47.280 --> 02:48.850
I've been looking for that.

02:49.480 --> 02:50.527
GORDY: <i>No way.</i>

02:50.960 --> 02:52.086
No freaking...

02:55.640 --> 02:56.641
Hiya.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.047
You're...

02:58.760 --> 03:00.444
It worked. My summoning actually...

03:00.600 --> 03:02.807
The only thing that summoned me was this.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.286
This vessel was already wearing out,

03:07.760 --> 03:10.684
and my trip under the sea did not help.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.411
With a little power up...

03:27.720 --> 03:28.801
Hey.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.889
Won't last long, but it'll do.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.645
So, you and your pal,

03:34.800 --> 03:39.203
you typical of my following
on Earth these days? 'Cause...

03:39.480 --> 03:41.642
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You can't be Lucifer.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.485
You're Vince Vincente. My mom loves you.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.609
You're kind of famous.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.801
Huh.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.720
Kind of famous.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.643
Twerking. Booyah.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.121
- Seriously?
- What?

04:28.280 --> 04:31.045
So, I've been trying to dig up info
on the British Men of Letters,

04:31.200 --> 04:32.531
keeping an eye out for cases,

04:32.720 --> 04:36.406
and you've been goofing off with a game
that went out of style five years ago.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.603
I don't think Mom's quite ready
for Snapchat.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.006
You're playing against Mom?

04:40.240 --> 04:41.366
Yeah.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.411
The same Mom that didn't know
what a cell phone was a month ago?

04:45.360 --> 04:46.361
Yeah.

04:46.560 --> 04:47.925
Doesn't exactly seem like a fair fight.

04:53.800 --> 04:54.881
You were saying?

04:56.440 --> 04:57.566
Huh.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.811
So, how's she been lately?

05:00.400 --> 05:02.846
She's good, you know, she's dealing.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.281
Hey, Cass.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.441
Hello, Dean.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.405
<i>You still living out an 1980s buddy comedy
with Crowley?</i>

05:11.560 --> 05:13.130
Unfortunately.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.811
Any news on Lucifer?

05:14.960 --> 05:16.724
<i>Actually, yes. Look at the news.</i>

05:18.760 --> 05:20.967
One sec.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.401
No way.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.531
So, this is from today.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.925
FEMALE REPORTER: <i>We're here in front
of Death Siren Records...</i>

05:32.080 --> 05:33.206
No freaking way.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.491
<i>Yeah, it's great having the band
back together again.</i>

05:36.720 --> 05:38.210
<i>In the studio, feeling pumped.</i>

05:38.800 --> 05:40.723
<i>Haven't felt this fired up in ages.</i>

05:41.080 --> 05:43.082
REPORTER: <i>A lot of people are saying
your style of rock</i>

05:43.280 --> 05:45.328
<i>could never make a comeback
in today's landscape.</i>

05:45.520 --> 05:46.521
<i>What do you say to them?</i>

05:49.320 --> 05:50.446
<i>Go to Hell.</i>

05:51.440 --> 05:52.805
Tell me that's not Lucifer.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.041
We don't know.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.811
Cass, I thought you said
Rowena got some licks in.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.042
Shouldn't he have
burned through his vessel by now?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.930
Yeah, but we don't know. We don't...

06:02.560 --> 06:04.130
Hello, boys. Long time.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.169
We team up to save the world,
and then bupkis.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.446
You don't call, you don't write.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.601
Yeah, we don't care.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.280
- Crowley, Lucifer.
- Lucifer.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.450
Think about it.
Of all the extinct rock acts,

06:14.640 --> 06:16.404
Ladyheart are the most Paleolithic.

06:16.640 --> 06:20.167
<i>A major label-sponsored comeback
in 2016 for those dinosaurs?</i>

06:20.480 --> 06:24.166
It doesn't feel like a wholly
natural turn of events, does it?

06:24.360 --> 06:26.840
Maybe Lucifer found a way
to heal his vessel.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.963
Yeah, but still. I mean, what the hell?

06:29.120 --> 06:31.248
<i>He's in LA. I'll see you there.</i>

06:31.440 --> 06:33.681
Oh. LA.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.401
Yeah.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.801
Where are you going?

06:39.320 --> 06:40.446
I know a guy.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.006
Hello, Russell.

07:07.800 --> 07:08.926
Brother Crowley.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.923
One moment,
just let me tie this off real quick.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.091
All right! So...

07:18.880 --> 07:22.089
What brings you
to the City of Angels?

07:22.680 --> 07:24.284
You know this is my city.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.524
What's with all this Maharishi crap?

07:28.040 --> 07:30.042
I moved to the Westside last year.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.648
Started daily meditation,
yoga, green juice.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.961
Helps to keep
the ego and the anger in check.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.362
But enough about me.
How have you been, huh?

07:40.720 --> 07:43.690
Health? Family? Hell?

07:44.320 --> 07:47.403
Doesn't matter. Don't care.
And been better.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.842
Well, good news. Good news.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.884
I got a couple of
quality up-and-comers for you.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.530
Thirsty young talent,
souls ripe for the taking.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.647
You have been pleased
with our arrangement so far?

08:03.120 --> 08:06.442
Oh. As punch, a soul's a soul.

08:06.720 --> 08:11.248
But there is a certain prestige
to owning a Swift or a Drake.

08:11.800 --> 08:12.847
You like that?

08:13.400 --> 08:15.562
It's a gift from Dre.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.803
This whole Vince Vincente comeback thing,

08:22.320 --> 08:23.321
it's a joke, right?

08:23.680 --> 08:26.331
No. Deadly serious, my friend.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.446
We've raided, repackaged, and resold
everything else from our past.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.448
Why not give hair metal another shot?

08:34.400 --> 08:38.688
Yeah, okay. I doubted it, too,
but Vince came to me with a killer pitch.

08:39.919 --> 08:43.049
The original Ladyheart line-up, reunited.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.168
Back in the day,
those cats sold, like, 10 mill.

08:46.440 --> 08:47.965
So did Hootie and the Blowfish.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.248
And I'll bring them back, too.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.404
I know Ladyheart might be a punch line

08:52.560 --> 08:55.928
but the band's got
off-the-chart name recognition.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.364
And just talking to Vince,

08:58.640 --> 09:00.688
he seemed different, you know?

09:01.640 --> 09:04.769
Energized. Reborn. Lit.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.286
Like a whole new man?

09:07.120 --> 09:08.167
Exactly.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.327
All right.
450 miles to LA.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.443
Land of gridlock, Botox, over-taxing,

09:24.600 --> 09:27.809
under achieving,
smell of sweaty desperation.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.322
I mean, you can't breathe.
Beaches are toxic.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.563
You got dudes in skinny jeans
wearing sunglasses inside.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.008
Image-obsessed narcissists.

09:38.680 --> 09:41.160
I do like the yoga pants, though.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.330
<i>When's the last time we were in LA?</i>

09:43.760 --> 09:46.366
About 10 years ago?
Doing a vengeful spirit.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.207
Man, that seems like forever ago,
doesn't it?

09:52.680 --> 09:53.681
Hey-

09:55.160 --> 09:56.400
Trying to talk to you here.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.721
What?

09:58.280 --> 09:59.361
What're you listening to?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.364
Uh, podcast. Why?

10:02.200 --> 10:03.361
All right, Well.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.048
I need something to keep me awake,
so crank it up.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.403
I mean, it's a history podcast.

10:13.160 --> 10:17.848
Well, I like history.
You know, gladiators and outlaws, pirates.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.361
Hell, we're driving
a piece of history right here.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.451
Not that kind of history. This is a...

10:24.160 --> 10:27.369
It's a podcast on the history
of the Protestant Reformation.

10:27.720 --> 10:31.611
A multi-part exploration
of each of Martin Luther's 95 theses.

10:31.840 --> 10:32.807
Oh.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.006
Yeah, that's what I thought.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.561
Oh, Sam, hair rock, really?

10:44.760 --> 10:46.091
- It's not hair...
- Come on.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.164
It's not hair rock, Dean, it's hard rock.
It's legitimate hard rock.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.085
- Wow.
- Don't judge a book by its cover.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.523
Yeah, or a dude
by his rainbow wig and leopard prints.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.643
Rainbow wig? What?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.924
You know what? I'm done apologizing.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.242
Lucifer possessed Vince Vincente.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.925
This is Vince Vincente's music.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.287
So, listening to it is research.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.641
No, no.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.610
As a matter of fact, study up, Dean.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.606
- No. I don't wanna listen to it.
- You like it.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.963
No, no. No, no. No. Turn it off.

11:19.840 --> 11:20.887
It'll grow on you.

11:35.280 --> 11:39.444
Your tweet about Ladyheart's reunion
already has over a million engagements.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.041
When you were solo,
you were lucky to have 300 likes.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.964
The band's teaser track on SoundCloud...

11:44.280 --> 11:46.931
500K streams in four hours.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.765
BuzzFeed just posted a listicle.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.769
"Ten Things You Need to
Know About Ladyheart."

11:51.200 --> 11:53.282
This is good, Vince. This is really good.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.687
Great.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.246
ROSELEEN: <i>It's happening, Vince.</i>

11:56.640 --> 11:58.404
I knew we were gonna be famous again.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.321
TOMMY: <i>Vince.</i>

12:01.640 --> 12:04.644
So, we actually gonna record or what?

12:06.480 --> 12:07.481
Hmm.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.810
Not really feeling it.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.009
Come on, man. The band's back together.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.647
We've got an actual recording budget.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.561
Dude, let's make some music.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.047
Music.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.449
What are the fans saying
about me right now?

12:30.840 --> 12:33.081
They're tweeting about your drinks
with Pam Anderson last night.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.089
<i>Speculating if you two are rekindling.</i>

12:35.200 --> 12:37.043
<i>And they're debating
whether Vince Vincente</i>

12:37.200 --> 12:39.362
is bae, nay, or daddy.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.171
What the hell does that even mean?

12:42.680 --> 12:44.648
It means it's not about the music.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.160
It never really was.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.364
You know, rock's not the reason.
It's just an excuse.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.240
To worship.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.126
To adore.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.250
See, humans have always been desperate
to put someone or something above them.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.647
<i>Let's face it.</i>

13:01.880 --> 13:03.723
God ain't cutting it these days.

13:04.240 --> 13:08.290
It takes a Kim Kardashian,
a whatever Justin Bieber is.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.241
A me.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.846
They're enjoying the ride.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.401
So should you.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.007
What?

13:50.880 --> 13:51.881
It's good.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.603
It's vegetable water.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.325
CASTIEL: Sam. Dean.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.089
Hey. Consider switching up the duds there?

14:00.360 --> 14:01.646
It's a bit stiff for this town.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.041
He could be an agent or something.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.890
Yeah, maybe a third-tier agent.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.889
At least I don't look like a lumberjack.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.406
SAM: <i>Okay, enough.</i>

14:08.720 --> 14:10.768
Guys, where's Crowley?

14:11.720 --> 14:13.404
He said he'd meet us here.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.611
Frankly, I appreciate the break.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.605
It's been weeks.
And he's been right there just talking,

14:18.760 --> 14:21.570
and talking, and talking.
It's relentless...

14:23.560 --> 14:24.641
Don't listen to him.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.963
Feathers and I
are all but inseparable now.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.287
You find anything?

14:28.440 --> 14:31.842
Yes. Vince Vincente
is riding with the Devil.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.886
Okay, so what now?

14:37.080 --> 14:38.844
I suggest we go check out his room.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.561
Vince is scheduled to be
at the studio all day, so we're covered.

14:41.920 --> 14:42.921
How'd you get the card?

14:43.120 --> 14:45.487
This is LA. I know a lot of people.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.328
Well, looks like
there was some kind of fight.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.286
Mmm. Yeah. Some kind.

15:07.520 --> 15:08.646
Look at this.

15:09.480 --> 15:13.769
Rock star biographies. Like, all of them.
From Aerosmith to ZZ Top.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.884
It's like he's studying
how to become famous.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.722
Well, so, what, Lucifer's a dork?

15:22.640 --> 15:23.687
That's good to know.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.247
Look, "The seeds of a ripe dragon fruit"

15:26.400 --> 15:29.404
"drizzled with exactly one ounce
of acacia honey,"

15:29.640 --> 15:32.644
"prepared in a ceramic bowl, no plastic."

15:33.000 --> 15:34.126
What is this spell?

15:34.840 --> 15:37.081
It's breakfast. It's Vince's rider.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.167
I've seen worse.

15:39.560 --> 15:42.564
I don't get it. Lucifer could be
taking over Heaven and Hell right now,

15:42.720 --> 15:45.564
and instead, he's trying to act out
some rock-god fantasy?

15:45.760 --> 15:47.046
Yeah, who wouldn't?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.126
CASTIEL: <i>I found something.</i>

15:52.560 --> 15:53.641
What is that?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.766
It appears to be a human tooth
pulled out by the root.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.490
Can I ask you something?

16:09.400 --> 16:11.050
Why are you spending time with me?

16:12.320 --> 16:14.607
You ignored me for years.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.565
Not that I blamed you.

16:18.560 --> 16:23.248
I was a fool not to recognize
such sweet devotion.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.405
Talk to me, Roseleen.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.561
Tell me about...

16:37.400 --> 16:38.447
Me.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.685
You're Vince.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.530
Vince Vincente.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.841
And I knew I was in love with you
the moment I saw you.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.922
I was 16, just a normal kid
growing up in Arcadia.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.051
Arcadia. Sounds beautiful.

16:55.400 --> 16:59.849
I was watching <i>Headbangers Ball,</i>
and the "Bloody Messiah" video came on.

17:00.840 --> 17:01.966
And I...

17:02.600 --> 17:03.601
Oh.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.089
It was your voice.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.771
And your hair.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.286
And your eyes.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.011
It was everything.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.124
You were everything.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.727
And even when people made fun of me,

17:17.000 --> 17:18.240
younger girls at work,

17:18.960 --> 17:22.248
shredding on my Ladyheart tattoos,
and saying you're a joke,

17:22.599 --> 17:24.568
I never stopped loving you.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.444
And I never will.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.724
How much do you love me?

17:35.240 --> 17:38.005
What would you do to show me?

17:41.160 --> 17:42.161
Anything.

17:48.760 --> 17:49.886
Anything?

17:55.840 --> 17:57.126
Would you bleed?

18:03.640 --> 18:04.846
Then bleed.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.724
Mrs. Greenfield has lost a lot of blood,

18:32.920 --> 18:34.490
and there'll be no fixing those scars.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.926
But she's stable.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.602
And she cut herself?

18:38.960 --> 18:42.362
She carved his name into her chest.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.527
"Vince Vincente." Didn't skip a letter.
And she cut deep.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.121
Thanks, Doctor.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.931
Well, again, what the hell?

18:54.400 --> 18:56.402
- I'll go talk to her.
- No! No, no, no, you won't.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.443
Cass, stay here, keep an eye on him.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.001
Well...

19:06.280 --> 19:08.044
Together again.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.161
Yay.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.970
SAM: <i>We want to understand what happened.</i>

19:17.400 --> 19:19.402
<i>But in order for us to do that,
we need you to talk.</i>

19:19.960 --> 19:22.930
Roseleen, did Vince force you to do this?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.121
No.

19:25.680 --> 19:26.806
Vince didn't.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.805
He wouldn't have to.

19:30.360 --> 19:34.126
I wanted to. To show him.
To make him happy.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.927
You ever stop and wonder
what kind of a sicko gets happy

19:37.080 --> 19:39.082
off of watching someone
melon ball their own flesh?

19:39.320 --> 19:41.049
Don't talk about Vince like that.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.004
He had a reason, a good reason.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.566
He must have.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.128
<i>I'm sure he can explain everything.</i>

19:55.680 --> 19:57.569
If I could just see him...

19:58.960 --> 20:00.530
I need to get to the show!

20:01.600 --> 20:02.601
Please!

20:06.800 --> 20:07.847
Please!

20:11.600 --> 20:16.367
Okay, we're building an aura of mystery
and exclusivity with tonight's show.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.291
Undisclosed location,
small, select audience.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.529
It's as much about
who doesn't get a ticket as who does.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.927
This could push your social media profile
to Kimye levels.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.321
Who gets the tickets?

20:28.480 --> 20:30.323
It's an online lottery of local fans.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.482
But it'll tend towards
the Ladyheart die-hards,

20:32.640 --> 20:34.802
- they'll be more engaged...
- I've had my fill with die-hards.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.650
They already love me.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.491
<i>Religion, celebrity, Twitter,</i>

20:41.320 --> 20:42.731
it's all the same rules.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.926
If you're not gaining followers,
you're losing followers.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.123
I want a different crowd tonight.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.446
New fans.

20:52.240 --> 20:55.084
Look, getting a new audience is great

20:55.280 --> 20:58.682
for social media visibility,
which is great for overall buzz,

20:58.880 --> 21:00.689
but they're fickle.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.725
They don't spend any money on music,
they have no loyalty.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.645
Good luck translating their attention
to album or ticket sales.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.410
I don't care.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.886
I want fresh blood.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.001
Got it.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.206
So, this show is tonight?

21:29.440 --> 21:30.441
That's what she said.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.808
Can Lucifer even sing
or play an instrument?

21:33.040 --> 21:35.486
Yeah, I doubt they offer
Intro to Guitar in the Cage.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.681
CROWLEY: <i>Like it matters.</i>

21:36.920 --> 21:39.764
What Lucifer made that woman do
has got nothing to do with the music.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.968
- It's about devotion.
- Come again?

21:42.160 --> 21:45.243
You little people wouldn't understand.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.726
<i>But I've been a king.</i>

21:47.000 --> 21:49.844
Having people look at you
like you're everything.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.767
Knowing that once they buy in,
you can make them do anything.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.241
It's intoxicating.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.926
Well, that's super creepy.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.485
Okay, so, this concert.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.560
All these people.
What is Lucifer planning to do?

22:02.720 --> 22:03.721
Nothing good.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.085
- Is Rowena...
- Dear Mother says...

22:07.760 --> 22:10.240
That once we catch Lucifer,
she'll show, no sooner.

22:10.440 --> 22:11.771
Well, without Rowena, we're outgunned.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.001
With her, we're outgunned.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.088
It doesn't matter, guys. This is our shot.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.930
We just got to find out
where he's playing tonight.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.241
All right, let's get to work.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.844
A mystery to even me.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.124
Though even if I did know,
I probably wouldn't tell you.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.923
You'd threaten
our very lucrative partnership

22:30.240 --> 22:33.961
for one over-the hill,
bad-dye-job rock dinosaur?

22:34.280 --> 22:36.601
I'm smelling money with Vince, bro.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.446
This is business, Crowley.
It's nothing personal.

22:46.760 --> 22:50.970
No, believe me, it's personal.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.121
Tommy.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.569
You guys, I'll meet you inside.

23:02.760 --> 23:05.206
Agent, what are you doing here, man?

23:05.480 --> 23:07.323
Investigating Vince, same as before.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.649
You hear what happened to Roseleen?

23:12.520 --> 23:14.568
Yeah, man, it was awful.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.451
But, I mean, come on, man,
she cut herself, right? It wasn't like...

23:18.640 --> 23:20.688
You know that's not the whole truth.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.004
You know Vince isn't Vince.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.560
We're the brothers that rock together.
Mmm.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.842
We're kind of like the American Oasis.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.161
Ew.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.323
- Um... But with synths.
- Yeah, right.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.409
- So, you know, we're hip.
- Exactly.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.841
Who plays what?

23:42.040 --> 23:44.122
- I'm on keys, he's on drums...
- Guitar.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.364
Drums and guitar. I pretty much do it all.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.281
We saw online
that you represent Vince Vincente.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.327
We were kind of hoping you could do for us
what you've done for him.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.885
Sorry. Took this meeting
'cause you looked hot in your pics,

24:00.080 --> 24:01.445
but I'm not feeling this.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.841
You know what, we're not actually here
for the meeting.

24:04.680 --> 24:05.681
Vince's show tonight.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.167
Where is it?

24:07.360 --> 24:08.486
Who are you guys?

24:08.880 --> 24:10.041
Look, you must've noticed.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.725
Vince is different.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.441
I don't know.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.722
You're messing with hellfire, Russell.

24:19.960 --> 24:23.009
You will find out where that show is.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.527
You will tell me.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.491
Or I will end you.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.567
Brigitta! Get me
another green juice in here. Namaste.

24:42.800 --> 24:43.961
Where's the show, Tommy?

24:44.240 --> 24:47.562
Man, I don't know what the hell's
going on with Vince, all right?

24:48.040 --> 24:50.168
All the royalties on our hits
dried up years ago.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.163
I got two daughters in college.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.561
I know what I saw, but...

24:55.560 --> 24:57.608
You don't care who pays the price?

25:02.840 --> 25:03.921
Sorry.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.842
Vince gives me the skeeves,
but he's a paying client.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.366
No. He's the Devil.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.443
Yeah, like, literally.

25:14.120 --> 25:17.442
I'm in PR.
I've worked for sexists, racists,

25:17.600 --> 25:19.125
<i>even politicians.</i>

25:19.400 --> 25:21.767
My job is making saints out of devils.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.521
No way I'm threatening my reputation
by working against his interests.

25:25.920 --> 25:29.527
So, you need to take a step back
or I start screaming,

25:29.640 --> 25:35.090
and in a crowded place like this,
girl like me, two guys like you...

25:35.640 --> 25:36.971
Guess what happens next.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.407
Bye-bye.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.687
And you said you put the fear in Russell.

25:54.880 --> 25:55.927
I thought I had.

25:58.320 --> 26:01.608
These yoga types. Just when you think
you've harshed their mellow...

26:01.840 --> 26:04.889
Yeah, well, I've been looking
everywhere online and...

26:05.880 --> 26:07.450
No one's leaked the venue yet.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.005
- Seriously?
- What?

26:15.480 --> 26:16.527
Shut up.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.647
Cass.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.127
Anything?

26:24.760 --> 26:25.761
No.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.724
So, we couldn't flip a single member
of Vince's team.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.684
Even with the threat of mass murder,

26:32.800 --> 26:34.723
these SoCal douchebags
won't do the right thing.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.445
Welcome to Los Angeles.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.530
So, what happens now?

26:54.440 --> 26:57.887
I've never seen
so many crying emojis in my life.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.411
The people who didn't get in,

26:59.560 --> 27:02.040
they're rending garments all over Twitter.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.882
<i>Gossip blogs, social media.</i>

27:05.200 --> 27:08.044
They're on fire speculating about
the secret reunion show.

27:08.400 --> 27:10.482
- And the winners?
- Thrilled.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.406
They'd be more thrilled
if we had new music to sell.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.681
What?

27:18.440 --> 27:21.250
Well, Vince was a no-show at the studio.

27:21.720 --> 27:22.721
Again.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.561
The muse.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.800
Guess she took a powder.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.124
<i>Relax, Russell.</i>

27:30.720 --> 27:32.006
Tonight's show

27:33.280 --> 27:34.566
is gonna kill.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.203
I took a chance on you, Vince.

27:37.800 --> 27:41.600
An aging, well-past-his-prime butt rocker.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.488
You will get in line.

27:45.720 --> 27:46.801
Ur?

27:47.360 --> 27:49.169
Or I take it all back.

27:49.680 --> 27:50.841
- Huh?
- Whoa...

27:52.640 --> 27:54.051
Check your contract, slick.

27:54.280 --> 27:57.727
You don't do what I say,
I can bury Ladyheart.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.161
I own you.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.081
Do you?

28:02.400 --> 28:03.481
Yeah.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.761
What's happening here?

28:18.320 --> 28:19.321
Hey, man.

28:19.520 --> 28:20.521
TOMMY: <i>Vince, what're you doing?</i>

28:20.680 --> 28:21.727
Hey, man.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.286
- Hey!
- Vince, stop!

28:23.480 --> 28:24.845
- Hey!
- Vince!

28:27.400 --> 28:28.481
Hey, man.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.201
Well...

28:46.320 --> 28:48.004
See y'all inside.

28:52.800 --> 28:53.801
Vince!

28:55.440 --> 28:56.566
Vince!

29:11.640 --> 29:13.165
LUCIFER: <i>Who's ready to have fun?</i>

29:13.960 --> 29:16.042
WOMAN: Vince! Hey!

29:16.320 --> 29:17.401
Vince!

29:18.720 --> 29:21.326
WOMAN: <i>Thank you! I love you, Vince!</i>

29:21.520 --> 29:22.521
I quit.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.321
Guys.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.050
Tommy's still not answering.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.810
Well, he got us here. That's what matters.

30:44.920 --> 30:47.048
Enochian handcuffs? That's your move?

30:47.280 --> 30:49.442
- They held me.
- You're not him.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.011
We have no sure bets here, okay?

30:51.200 --> 30:53.521
Anything that we use
is gonna be like popping BBs.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.967
Ah. Great pep talk. Go, team.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.328
Guys, we're here to do more
than just take a shot at Lucifer.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.441
- We are?
- <i>Yes.</i>

30:59.680 --> 31:01.205
We need to save the people inside, too.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.767
I'll take Lucifer. He's my responsibility.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.122
No, he's not.
He's all of our responsibility.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.846
Well, the only way you'll clear that crowd
without drawing fire

31:08.960 --> 31:10.610
is if he's otherwise engaged.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.404
Engaged in what, Cass? Killing you?

31:12.680 --> 31:16.446
Cass, you'll last three minutes. Tops.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.563
Then I'll buy you three minutes.

31:21.640 --> 31:22.766
Make it four.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.809
What? I help.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.721
Have you seen that crowd?

31:38.920 --> 31:42.367
Man, I have not seen
an audience this hyped

31:42.560 --> 31:45.848
since we headlined
Monsters of Rock in 1991, man.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.527
And the girls...

31:48.560 --> 31:50.767
Perfect age.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.845
Tommy. You okay?

31:56.640 --> 31:58.688
Our fearless leader.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.688
How you feeling about the show, Tommy?

32:10.280 --> 32:14.683
Yeah, me too. The nerves.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.441
VVhoops!

32:21.760 --> 32:24.047
Guess I should've practiced
before tonight.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.921
Or, you know, ever.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.367
Who are you?

32:28.640 --> 32:31.644
Who I was, well, that doesn't matter.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.371
Who I am,

32:34.200 --> 32:36.771
well, I'm Vince Vincente, rock god.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.648
And after careful deliberation,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.241
I've decided to cut the dead weight.

32:42.760 --> 32:43.886
I'm going solo.

32:46.840 --> 32:47.841
Castiel.

32:53.360 --> 32:54.566
Took you long enough.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.728
Did you bring the rest of
the Little Rascals?

33:01.480 --> 33:02.561
Just me.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.330
Spanky.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.290
Hey, any of you guys smell smoke?

33:35.720 --> 33:37.165
Vince, Vince, Vince!

33:38.920 --> 33:42.402
Did not take you
for the martyr type, Crowley.

33:42.640 --> 33:46.531
I'm really not. I just hate you that much.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.125
What are you doing, Lucifer?

33:58.560 --> 34:00.642
You mean nothing to those kids out there.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.169
You think they'd draw blood for you?

34:03.600 --> 34:04.806
By choice?

34:05.040 --> 34:06.041
Well...

34:07.360 --> 34:09.681
I thought I'd at least ask.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.446
And if they won't give it up by choice,

34:15.920 --> 34:18.605
- maybe I'll just take it.
- Why?

34:18.920 --> 34:20.809
Because it's fun.

34:21.719 --> 34:23.165
Because I can.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.284
And because being Lucifer,

34:25.639 --> 34:28.007
so much Judeo-Christian baggage.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.487
But Vince, he's famous.

34:32.480 --> 34:33.844
Everybody loves him.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.251
And I need love.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.966
I had a really jacked childhood.

34:44.400 --> 34:45.400
Hey, Tommy.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.763
You think this is fun?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.128
Oh, I wouldn't expect you to understand.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.369
I was inside you.

34:56.600 --> 34:57.840
I know what a weak,

34:58.200 --> 35:02.125
duty-bound, pleasureless dullard you are.

35:04.760 --> 35:08.731
And you, bad doggy. Sit!

35:14.000 --> 35:16.162
No, seriously,
I think I smell smoke. Everyone...

35:16.320 --> 35:17.606
Sure you're not having a stroke?

35:17.800 --> 35:19.245
Hey, I'm serious.
We need to get out of here.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.521
- Step off, Dad!
- Hey.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.682
What's your problem, man! Get off me!
Get this guy off me!

35:24.880 --> 35:27.406
Listen to me.
Listen, we've got to get out of here.

35:27.680 --> 35:29.045
- All right.
- Get screwed.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.887
Okay. Look, we got to
get everybody out of here.

35:46.080 --> 35:47.286
Clever girls.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.251
No, no. No, no, no, no, no!

35:57.720 --> 35:58.846
No!

36:07.120 --> 36:08.929
Stick around for the after party.

36:19.720 --> 36:20.926
Hello, LA!

36:36.440 --> 36:37.601
What a crowd.

36:39.320 --> 36:43.120
Look at all those fresh new faces.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.441
<i>Everyone excited?</i>

36:46.400 --> 36:47.640
<i>Yeah, you should be.</i>

36:48.440 --> 36:50.966
Tonight's not gonna be a typical show.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.963
Tonight, you're gonna see
and feel things...

36:55.480 --> 36:57.642
You never saw or felt before.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.528
Things might get a little bit messy.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.326
All right, screw it.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.209
- He's got a gun!
- We got to go! We got to go!

37:11.360 --> 37:12.771
Go, go! Come on, guys!

37:18.840 --> 37:20.330
No, no, no, no, no.

37:33.840 --> 37:34.841
Nah-uh-uh.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.651
CASTIEL: <i>Hey. Ass-butt.</i>

37:45.800 --> 37:46.847
Hi, Dean.

37:50.720 --> 37:53.200
Sam. Enjoy the show?

37:58.320 --> 37:59.526
<i>Look, guys...</i>

38:00.320 --> 38:03.244
You know I could end you all
with the snap of my finger.

38:04.520 --> 38:05.726
Why would I do that?

38:06.320 --> 38:09.369
When you can't do anything to me.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.561
Why are you doing this?

38:13.720 --> 38:14.721
Why?

38:15.040 --> 38:16.201
SAM: <i>You and God made up.</i>

38:16.680 --> 38:19.047
You forgave him. What would he think?

38:19.720 --> 38:22.200
Not especially interested in his opinion.

38:23.320 --> 38:27.086
Dear, old Dad, he finally apologized
for abandoning me,

38:27.280 --> 38:29.408
and what's the very next thing he does?

38:31.880 --> 38:33.450
He ditches me.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.851
And you, too, by the way.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.962
And rides off into the sunset
with Aunty Amara.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.882
He needed my help,

38:47.240 --> 38:49.242
and he'd say anything to get it.

38:50.640 --> 38:53.610
His words, your words, they mean nothing.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.931
Don't you get it? This is all meaningless.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.720
<i>Heaven, Hell.</i>

39:02.040 --> 39:03.405
<i>This world.</i>

39:05.120 --> 39:08.681
If it ever meant anything,
that moment is passed.

39:10.440 --> 39:14.445
Nothing down here but a bunch
of hopeless, distraction addicts.

39:16.440 --> 39:22.049
So filled with emptiness,
so desperate to fill up the void.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.449
They don't mind being served

39:26.800 --> 39:30.486
another stale rerun,
of a rerun, of a rerun.

39:32.440 --> 39:33.930
<i>You know what my plan is?</i>

39:35.880 --> 39:37.211
I don't have one.

39:37.720 --> 39:42.487
I'm just gonna keep on smashing
Daddy's already-broken toys,

39:42.680 --> 39:45.490
and make you watch.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.201
SAM: <i>Yeah?</i>

39:48.160 --> 39:50.128
'Cause it kind of looks like
you're falling apart.

39:50.640 --> 39:53.007
Yeah, you got a little something,
uh, right there.

39:53.640 --> 39:54.766
<i>I mean, face it.</i>

39:55.240 --> 39:56.321
Rock is dead.

39:56.840 --> 39:58.080
What can I say?

39:58.840 --> 40:01.810
Kicking your ass took a lot out of me.

40:02.440 --> 40:03.646
But don't worry...

40:04.480 --> 40:06.642
Onward and upward.

40:32.760 --> 40:33.841
How you feeling?

40:34.280 --> 40:35.406
Well, I'm not dead.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.640
Well, I got to hand it to you.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.325
You said you were gonna
draw Lucifer's fire,

40:39.520 --> 40:40.760
and you drew some serious fire.

40:41.360 --> 40:43.010
Oh, it was a grand success.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.248
Well, we didn't catch Lucifer,
but we did save the crowd,

40:49.400 --> 40:50.606
so I'm gonna call that a win.

40:50.840 --> 40:51.887
I wouldn't.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.530
Vince Vincente is dead.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.491
We never even hoped to save him.

40:58.760 --> 40:59.966
And yes, I know, the third album...

41:00.200 --> 41:01.929
No, he was still a person.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.688
And he meant something to a lot of people.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.645
<i>And Lucifer just took all that</i>

41:06.760 --> 41:09.047
<i>and just twisted all that up
and snuffed it out.</i>

41:10.760 --> 41:13.570
<i>Lucifer was bad enough
when he had a plan, a motive.</i>

41:14.040 --> 41:15.883
<i>Now he's just having fun.</i>

41:16.520 --> 41:18.204
<i>I mean, how many people died tonight?</i>

41:18.760 --> 41:22.207
<i>Them, this? It's all on us.
We let him out.</i>

41:22.760 --> 41:23.966
We're not winning.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.881
We're just losing slow.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.726
And you heard what he said.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.406
"Onwards and upwards." He's going big.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.925
And he'll go bigger.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.126
And we will stop him.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.247
We Will.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.765
It's what we do, man.
