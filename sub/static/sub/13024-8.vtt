01:11.958 --> 01:13.376
Oh, no!

01:13.460 --> 01:15.879
Please tell me there's not
a giant monster in there.

01:15.962 --> 01:18.381
Please tell me it's empty!
Or full of space candy.

01:18.465 --> 01:20.279
One of those two. Either one is fine.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.093
I don't think it's a pi?ata, Hunk.

01:22.177 --> 01:25.305
If it's the same kind of the monster
that attacked us on Arus,

01:25.388 --> 01:26.473
we already know how to beat it.

01:33.104 --> 01:34.230
Hold your ground!

02:07.180 --> 02:10.558
- It's not candy!
- And it's not the same monster!

02:11.976 --> 02:15.563
We need to draw its fire
away from the Balmera's surface!

02:39.087 --> 02:41.548
- We can't hold out!
- My lion is weakening!

02:41.631 --> 02:44.217
If the shield sustains structural damage,
we're done for!

02:44.300 --> 02:45.301
Pidge is right!

02:45.385 --> 02:48.513
Oh, Pidge is right. I'm the one
that said, "We can't hold out!"

02:48.596 --> 02:49.639
Lance, watch your footing!

02:54.227 --> 02:56.688
Okay, Team Voltron, disband!

02:57.397 --> 03:00.900
Everyone, evasive maneuvers!
It can't shoot us all at once!

03:04.446 --> 03:06.239
Okay, it can do that too.

03:19.210 --> 03:23.131
Where does Zarkon get these beasts from?
And how do they keep finding us?

03:23.214 --> 03:25.633
Princess, the particle barrier
won't sustain much longer.

03:25.717 --> 03:29.053
It's still not at full strength
after the blast from the Galra ship.

03:29.137 --> 03:30.930
Keith, try to draw its fire!

03:31.014 --> 03:33.475
- I'm coming in from above!
- Roger!

03:44.235 --> 03:46.154
We need to find its blind spot!

03:46.237 --> 03:49.783
I don't think this thing has a blind spot.
It has a thousand eyes.

03:51.242 --> 03:53.787
Laser eyes. Laser eyes!

03:56.331 --> 04:00.210
What do we do? Fighting this thing
is like fighting an entire fleet at once!

04:00.293 --> 04:02.712
I think we've got to aim
for those laser eyes

04:02.796 --> 04:05.215
- and take them out.
- We'll cover you from up here!

04:12.222 --> 04:14.891
We've lost the spectral generator!
Going to reserve!

04:14.974 --> 04:19.312
There's a fire in VIN bay three!
Suppressors on! Suppressors out!

04:19.394 --> 04:21.648
Princess, the ship is being torn apart!

04:21.731 --> 04:24.484
We're taking heavy fire up here!
We're in trouble!

04:24.567 --> 04:27.570
Princess, pull back!
Get out of its range, now!

04:27.654 --> 04:29.572
We will not abandon you!

04:29.656 --> 04:32.075
You're not abandoning us.
We're about to pull back anyway.

04:32.158 --> 04:34.869
- We are?
- We can't hold out. We have to.

04:34.953 --> 04:39.165
Lions, to the mine shafts! It's the only
place the monster can't get us.

04:39.249 --> 04:40.667
Roger that!

04:40.750 --> 04:42.585
<i>Heading into orbit!</i>

04:56.850 --> 04:57.976
What is happening?

04:58.059 --> 05:00.895
There's a monster up there
that Zarkon sent to destroy us.

05:00.979 --> 05:04.858
A monster?
Will Zarkon's savagery never abate?

05:04.941 --> 05:07.652
Perhaps our people were
never meant to be free.

05:07.735 --> 05:11.781
Shay, don't give up. Zarkon's power
grows with every planet he conquers,

05:11.865 --> 05:14.576
but he's weakened
by every being that fights back.

05:14.659 --> 05:18.329
Fight back against a monster like that?

05:18.413 --> 05:21.624
- How?
- I don't know, but we can beat it.

05:21.708 --> 05:23.668
- Tell her, Keith.
- Can we?

05:23.751 --> 05:27.463
Yes, we can! This is our first mission
and we're not going to fail.

05:27.547 --> 05:31.175
We can beat it. We just need
some time to come up with a plan.

05:31.259 --> 05:33.928
See? Told you we can.

05:34.012 --> 05:35.930
Thanks, Shiro.

05:39.350 --> 05:43.062
- Did you guys feel that over there?
- Yeah, we feel it.

05:43.146 --> 05:45.898
It's that sound again. What is that?

05:52.488 --> 05:55.283
That great noise comes
from the Balmera itself.

05:55.366 --> 05:57.619
Our home crumbles beneath our feet.

05:58.411 --> 06:00.663
The Balmera is dying.

06:02.915 --> 06:06.502
<i>- Coran, Allura, are you there?
- Shiro, we're here.</i>

06:06.586 --> 06:08.087
<i>- The Balmera...
- We already know.</i>

06:08.171 --> 06:12.550
Our scanners are showing
the life energy draining from the Balmera.

06:14.093 --> 06:15.678
How does that happen?

06:15.762 --> 06:17.430
<i>Removing crystals from a Balmera</i>

06:17.513 --> 06:20.642
<i>is like removing a vital part
of the mighty beast.</i>

06:20.725 --> 06:24.270
<i>The Balmera needs time
to regenerate itself to stay healthy,</i>

06:24.354 --> 06:28.524
<i>but the Galra's greed may have
cost this noble Balmera its life.</i>

06:28.608 --> 06:29.817
So, what's going to happen?

06:29.901 --> 06:33.529
<i>Its core will collapse, destabilizing
the entire skeletal structure.</i>

06:33.613 --> 06:36.407
<i>Anything or anyone remaining
on the Balmera at that point</i>

06:36.491 --> 06:38.910
<i>will be crushed into dust.</i>

06:38.993 --> 06:43.414
<i>- How long before its core collapses?
- Probably a matter of hours.</i>

06:43.498 --> 06:46.292
<i>The mighty organism
willingly gives itself to all,</i>

06:46.376 --> 06:49.045
<i>but not all return its kindness.</i>

06:49.962 --> 06:53.049
Then our time is short.
We'll evacuate the planet.

06:53.132 --> 06:56.010
We need to get all the Balmerans
to the Castle of Lions

06:56.094 --> 06:58.012
before the planet implodes.

06:58.096 --> 06:59.806
<i>Okay, that sounds like a good plan,</i>

06:59.889 --> 07:02.558
<i>but how on earth do you plan
on landing the Castle</i>

07:02.642 --> 07:04.852
<i>with that monster-thingy
on the surface?</i>

07:04.936 --> 07:08.272
<i>- You'll need a distraction.
- We'll engage the beast in our lions.</i>

07:08.356 --> 07:09.357
<i>With it distracted,</i>

07:09.440 --> 07:12.568
<i>Allura and Coran will land the Castle
and load all of its citizens.</i>

07:12.652 --> 07:15.488
<i>Or we could load Balmerans
into our lions a few at a time</i>

07:15.571 --> 07:16.906
<i>and shuttle them to the ship.</i>

07:16.990 --> 07:19.909
<i>No engaging ferocious laser-eye guy.
How long would that take?</i>

07:19.993 --> 07:23.496
<i>- Days? Weeks?
- We only have hours.</i>

07:23.579 --> 07:25.707
Look, we don't need to beat this thing.

07:25.790 --> 07:29.043
We just need to bait it away
from the ship. Provoke and evade.

07:29.127 --> 07:30.086
Okay, here's the thing.

07:30.169 --> 07:33.548
I'm worried that we're going to be really,
really good at the provoking part,

07:33.631 --> 07:35.967
and then really bad at the evading part.

07:36.050 --> 07:41.139
But if this is what it takes to save Shay
and everyone on the planet, then I'm in.

07:41.222 --> 07:43.141
Can you contact the other Balmerans?

07:43.224 --> 07:46.185
I can, but I know not what they'll say.

07:46.269 --> 07:49.230
Leave the planet? Our home?

07:49.313 --> 07:52.567
It's the only option. I'm coming down.

07:52.650 --> 07:54.819
Princess, no! It's too dangerous!

07:54.902 --> 07:57.905
Someone has to be there
to lead these people out.

07:57.989 --> 08:01.576
You're coming down? That thing will
spot your pod and blow it to pieces.

08:01.659 --> 08:03.161
<i>Let me worry about that.</i>

08:03.244 --> 08:06.289
You just focus on keeping
the creature distracted.

08:18.176 --> 08:20.970
Okay, we've provoked. Time to evade!

08:27.143 --> 08:29.771
<i>Princess, we've lured
the monster away. It's time.</i>

08:29.854 --> 08:32.565
I'll contact you all
when I'm on the ground.

08:32.648 --> 08:34.567
<i>Be careful out there.</i>

08:42.116 --> 08:43.409
Is that Allura?

08:46.079 --> 08:47.622
We've got to protect the Princess!

09:14.690 --> 09:15.691
I'm on the ground.

09:15.775 --> 09:18.903
<i>Hurry! I don't know how long
we can hold this thing off.</i>

09:20.029 --> 09:22.573
Shay, I'm going to need your help.

09:22.657 --> 09:23.866
Princess?

09:23.950 --> 09:26.160
Have you contacted
the other Balmerans?

09:27.662 --> 09:30.081
What is it? What's going on?

09:30.164 --> 09:34.877
All Balmerans give thanks for the kindness
you and the paladins bestowed upon us,

09:34.961 --> 09:38.548
but, alas, we cannot take leave
of our home.

09:38.631 --> 09:39.549
What?

09:39.632 --> 09:43.469
If our great Balmera's life cycle
is over because of us,

09:43.553 --> 09:46.806
then our desire is to stay with it
until the end.

09:46.889 --> 09:48.266
But you'll never survive.

09:48.349 --> 09:50.434
We contacted the others,
and all agree.

09:50.518 --> 09:53.146
It's not right
that you risk your lives for us.

09:53.229 --> 09:57.900
Please, away. We ask
for no more guilt and shame upon us.

09:57.984 --> 10:01.279
It is our wish.
The wish of all Balmerans.

10:02.488 --> 10:04.991
No. I won't give up on you.

10:05.074 --> 10:08.661
I won't give up on any of you,
no matter the circumstances.

10:08.744 --> 10:11.497
But we do not ask this of you. Please!

10:11.581 --> 10:14.917
I have heard your words.
Now, let me speak mine.

10:15.001 --> 10:19.088
I want to talk to the Balmerans.
Can you get a message to them from me?

10:19.172 --> 10:22.216
There is no need to speak for you.

10:22.300 --> 10:26.470
You have a unique power within.

10:26.554 --> 10:30.433
The Balmera will carry your words.

10:34.770 --> 10:39.692
Speak your heart, child.
All can hear you.

10:44.238 --> 10:50.494
Balmerans, this is Princess Allura.
You don't know me, but I am here to help.

10:50.578 --> 10:54.040
I know what it's like
to watch your home planet die.

10:54.123 --> 10:59.295
For I come from planet Altea, a planet
that has long been destroyed by the Galra.

10:59.378 --> 11:03.925
<i>But I refused to give up.
And now, you all have the same choice.</i>

11:04.008 --> 11:06.594
<i>You can decide now to devote your lives</i>

11:06.677 --> 11:09.972
<i>to making sure this never happens
to another planet.</i>

11:10.056 --> 11:13.434
<i>I am eternally sorry
for what has happened to the Balmera,</i>

11:13.517 --> 11:17.104
but I beg you,
do not let its dying be in vain.

11:17.188 --> 11:20.316
Honor the Balmera's death
by refusing to give up.

11:20.399 --> 11:23.569
Join me in my fight against the Galra.

11:25.988 --> 11:29.867
Your words have touched our hearts.

11:30.701 --> 11:32.411
Thank you.

11:32.495 --> 11:34.872
No, thank you.

11:34.956 --> 11:38.417
You've given us reason to hope again.

11:38.501 --> 11:42.797
Everyone, head to the caves
just under the surface.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.009
Princess, your speech must have worked.

11:47.093 --> 11:49.178
The Balmerans are moving
toward the surface!

11:57.019 --> 11:59.605
Coran, we're just beneath the surface.

11:59.689 --> 12:02.775
Triangulate my position.
This is your landing zone.

12:03.859 --> 12:06.028
Yes, Allura. Readying ship.

12:06.112 --> 12:09.824
Castle of Lions, coming in!
Paladins, how are you holding up?

12:12.868 --> 12:16.372
I think we've got him pretty distracted.
Are the Balmerans in position?

12:16.455 --> 12:19.000
They're making their way to the top.

12:49.739 --> 12:54.118
Bring them out!
Hurry, now!

13:02.376 --> 13:03.252
No!

13:11.594 --> 13:14.805
It's on the verge of collapsing!
We have to go!

13:14.889 --> 13:17.183
- But the Balmerans!
- They're trapped!

13:17.266 --> 13:19.852
What can be done?
Time is short!

13:25.983 --> 13:29.820
Every hit weakens the Balmera.
Have you evacuated yet? What's happening?

13:29.904 --> 13:33.407
<i>The Balmerans are trapped.
Just keep distracting that beast!</i>

13:33.491 --> 13:35.993
Uh, do you want us
to distract it by dying?

13:36.077 --> 13:37.745
Because that's what's going to happen!

13:37.828 --> 13:40.581
Guys, remember when I said
we didn't have to beat it?

13:40.664 --> 13:43.125
- Yes, I remember that.
- We might have to beat it.

13:44.960 --> 13:49.173
We're lost! All are trapped
with no chance for escape!

13:49.256 --> 13:51.258
We can't give up.

13:51.342 --> 13:53.052
But what can be done?

13:55.471 --> 13:56.806
The Balmera!

13:56.889 --> 14:00.684
The ground beneath your mighty ship
appears healed.

14:00.768 --> 14:04.105
Its essence thrives. But how?

14:04.188 --> 14:05.481
The Castle!

14:05.564 --> 14:09.860
Not just the Castle, but you, as well.

14:09.944 --> 14:13.656
It's true. Your Altean energy
combined with the ship's crystal

14:13.739 --> 14:16.075
has revitalized this part of the Balmera.

14:17.201 --> 14:21.163
That's it! Maybe we can perform
the ceremony you spoke about.

14:21.247 --> 14:24.166
- We can save the Balmera.
- What ceremony?

14:24.250 --> 14:29.088
In the days of old, when Alteans were
given the gift of crystals from a Balmera,

14:29.171 --> 14:32.341
we would repay its sacrifice
by performing a ceremony.

14:32.425 --> 14:36.220
<i>A sacred Altean would re-infuse
the Balmera with quintessence.</i>

14:36.303 --> 14:39.223
<i>In this way, we had
a symbiotic relationship.</i>

14:40.808 --> 14:43.269
The Galra have only been taking.

14:43.352 --> 14:45.438
It's time we give back.

14:46.856 --> 14:49.567
I can connect
with the crystal in the bridge

14:49.650 --> 14:51.986
and use the Castle's power
as an amplifier.

14:52.069 --> 14:55.197
When your father performed the ceremony,
it was on a much smaller scale.

14:55.281 --> 14:56.282
I beg you.

14:56.365 --> 14:59.827
To heal an entire planet, it could take
more energy than you possess.

14:59.910 --> 15:02.037
You may not live through it.

15:03.164 --> 15:07.293
I know you're scared for me, Coran,
but I must try.

16:02.515 --> 16:07.686
Guys, this isn't working. We'll never
take this beast down in our lions.

16:07.770 --> 16:09.855
Well, forming Voltron didn't work, either.

16:09.939 --> 16:12.650
Not without some way to shoot
all those laser eyes at once.

16:14.527 --> 16:18.155
That's weird.
What are you trying to tell me?

16:19.865 --> 16:22.660
Guys! Guys, something's happening here!

16:22.743 --> 16:26.830
I-I think there's a way to take down
all those laser eyes at once.

16:26.914 --> 16:28.123
Well, what is it?

16:28.207 --> 16:31.418
Do you remember how Voltron
formed that sword with Keith's bayard?

16:31.502 --> 16:35.130
I think my lion's telling me
I can do the same thing with my bayard.

16:35.214 --> 16:39.802
<i>- Are you sure?
- Let's find out. Form thingy!</i>

16:40.427 --> 16:44.014
- It didn't work!
- Because we didn't form Voltron yet.

16:44.098 --> 16:46.517
Oh, right. Yeah, I know.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.144
Guys, whatever we're planning,
let's hurry up and do it.

17:00.406 --> 17:05.743
We've got to defend the Castle!
Everyone, follow me. Form Voltron!

18:28.494 --> 18:30.120
It's not enough!

18:33.791 --> 18:35.292
We'll have to try something else!

18:53.227 --> 18:55.729
- Are you guys seeing this?
- Roger that.

18:55.813 --> 18:58.440
Let's see what this thing can do.
Engage!

19:29.763 --> 19:31.140
Guys, look!

20:45.130 --> 20:47.382
Princess, are you all right?

20:52.012 --> 20:53.388
Did it work?

20:53.472 --> 20:58.894
Yes. The Balmera lives. It thanks you.

21:08.779 --> 21:09.613
No!

21:34.263 --> 21:36.473
No way.

21:37.683 --> 21:39.852
The Balmera just saved us.

21:41.270 --> 21:43.146
Look at the crystals!

21:52.155 --> 21:56.743
Oh, who's a good Balmera? You are.
Who ate the big monster? You did.

21:56.827 --> 21:59.955
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

22:00.038 --> 22:02.541
Dude, what are you doing?

22:02.624 --> 22:07.212
What? It's alive,
and it wuvs my scwatches.

22:19.975 --> 22:22.811
Thank you for honoring
your vow to return.

22:23.478 --> 22:25.147
I should be thanking you.

22:25.230 --> 22:27.649
You made me understand
what's most important.

22:31.236 --> 22:35.032
Zarkon and his Galra Empire
are destroying lives.

22:35.115 --> 22:38.577
I'm a part of a team that can
change that. I know that, now.

22:41.246 --> 22:42.414
What is that?

22:45.500 --> 22:48.086
It's the dawn of a new day.
