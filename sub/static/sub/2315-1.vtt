03:43.432 --> 03:46.585
What is the supernatural?
Hmm? Anyone?

03:46.810 --> 03:50.259
Like ghosts or spirits or devils?

03:50.313 --> 03:51.939
Those are examples.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.317
Actions or events which we
cannot explain through science.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.485
Good.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.696
Before the discovery of a
pathogenic theory of medicine,

03:58.697 --> 04:01.896
people believed that sickness
was caused by evil spirits.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.660
A show of hands, if you get sick,

04:04.661 --> 04:06.746
who here would rather see
a priest before a doctor?

04:08.415 --> 04:10.817
Who here believes in God?

04:11.626 --> 04:13.744
Heaven? Hell?

04:14.171 --> 04:15.914
The apocalypse?

04:16.673 --> 04:18.074
Ghosts?

04:19.468 --> 04:22.417
Really? No one here believes
in ghosts. Interesting.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.516
David Q., one of my first patients,

04:27.517 --> 04:31.091
was a perfectly normal
12-year-old boy.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.522
One day, that all changed.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.596
<i>Who are you drawing, David?</i>

04:38.361 --> 04:39.853
You know.

04:40.155 --> 04:43.229
<i>Tell me again, to the camera.</i>

04:46.119 --> 04:47.862
<i>Mr. Gregor,</i>

04:49.372 --> 04:52.241
<i>the man that makes things happen.</i>

05:08.725 --> 05:11.560
What if you could prove that
the supernatural was merely

05:11.561 --> 05:15.564
a manifestation of what already
exists in the mind, the subconscious?

05:15.565 --> 05:17.691
- What you're doing is immoral.
- Traitor.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.318
That was disgusting.
How dare you do that?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.653
- It's not disgusting!
- You left!

05:20.654 --> 05:23.933
No, don't take it personally.
Don't take it personally.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.568
The onus is on the scientist
to prove himself.

05:27.577 --> 05:31.607
So, where to start?
With the individual.

05:32.833 --> 05:36.658
You cure one patient,
you cure all mankind.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.547
You have no idea.

05:39.548 --> 05:40.756
You don't get to have an opinion.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.550
- You don't know how crazy...
- It's so bizarre.

05:42.551 --> 05:46.080
Harry, will you take
that for me? And this?

05:46.763 --> 05:49.837
Phillip, you're
welcome back anytime.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.253
Let's have a chat. I'll see
you guys back at the house.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.848
<i>There's not much of a budget,
everyone's working for science.</i>

06:01.403 --> 06:05.683
Your job would be to document
every step of the experiment.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.601
I hope you don't scare easily.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.860
Do you speak?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.858
Of course.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.369
Tell me about yourself, Brian.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.867
There's not much to tell.

06:21.131 --> 06:24.592
I like cameras, that's
my nature, I guess.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.302
To be curious?

06:26.303 --> 06:27.795
To film.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.681
And what's your passion?

06:30.682 --> 06:31.849
Passion?

06:31.850 --> 06:36.228
Yes, what story are you looking
for with that camera of yours?

06:36.229 --> 06:38.631
I don't know, everything.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.552
Are you a believer?

06:46.323 --> 06:48.566
My mother's religious.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.732
My father's a banker, a clerk.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.198
My father works in town,
my mother is at home.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.074
Hmm.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.861
I wonder,

07:00.170 --> 07:04.746
are you avoiding my question out of a
reluctance to talk about yourself,

07:04.841 --> 07:07.243
or because you're
genuinely confused?

07:09.763 --> 07:14.589
Uh, I suppose I don't know
what I believe in yet.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.178
Well, that's fair enough.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.762
Well, Brian,

07:20.273 --> 07:24.678
welcome to the experiment.
You are our official chronicler.

07:34.955 --> 07:39.500
I work with the A.V., the
audiovisual department.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.619
But you are a student here, no?

07:41.670 --> 07:44.630
No, I'd never get in here.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.132
So how did you get involved
with the Experiment?

07:47.133 --> 07:50.878
I volunteered as a subject.

07:52.055 --> 07:55.224
Professor Coupland, or
Joseph if you like,

07:55.225 --> 07:57.377
he thought I was all wrong.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.717
Not tortured enough, apparently.

08:01.231 --> 08:05.226
He already had someone
truly psychotic.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.399
<i>I see someone.</i>

08:12.242 --> 08:14.986
<i>Good, Jane. Who do you see?</i>

08:15.537 --> 08:17.939
<i>Do you recognize this person?</i>

08:18.540 --> 08:22.160
<i>I don't know. I'm not sure.</i>

08:22.836 --> 08:26.740
<i>A girl... I see a little girl.</i>

08:30.427 --> 08:31.828
<i>No,</i>

08:35.097 --> 08:36.841
<i>maybe a doll.</i>

08:44.941 --> 08:46.684
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

08:47.110 --> 08:51.185
<i>It's okay, you're perfectly safe.</i>

08:52.115 --> 08:54.609
<i>Her name is Evey. I don't like her.</i>

08:57.287 --> 08:59.985
<i>The doll's name is Evey?</i>

09:04.377 --> 09:06.074
<i>I just need to sleep.</i>

09:10.133 --> 09:14.379
Be quiet! Calm down! It's just
the pipes, it's just the pipes!

09:20.060 --> 09:21.552
Crazy fun, no?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.047
Go on up.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.914
It's for her own protection.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.412
And ours.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.846
What's wrong with her?

09:57.847 --> 10:01.421
Suicidal. She remembers
nothing from her past.

10:02.018 --> 10:06.264
Foster child, abandoned.
Passed from house to house.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.011
Families would keep
her for a bit, then,

10:11.653 --> 10:15.523
you know, things would happen.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.743
The furniture would move,
objects would catch on fire.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.613
The authorities were
convinced she was possessed.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.367
Luckily, Joseph discovered her.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.245
He ruled out
schizophrenia, the usual.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.077
Then he measured her brain waves.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.951
Frequencies off the charts, look.

10:36.052 --> 10:39.456
That's why he chose her.
He took her from the asylum.

10:43.977 --> 10:48.132
Well, Brian, welcome
to the Experiment.

10:54.070 --> 10:58.475
Don't look into her eyes, don't say
anything to her if you can help it.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.982
I can't have the experiment
corrupted by outside influences.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.820
I understand.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.176
What?

11:34.569 --> 11:36.812
Did you think my head
was going to spin off?

11:42.577 --> 11:45.696
Sorry if I disturbed you.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.498
It comes and goes.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.750
Excuse me?

11:49.751 --> 11:51.744
What's inside.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.297
Stop staring at my wrists.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.450
Sorry.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.707
I promised Joseph that
I wouldn't try again,

12:02.722 --> 12:04.715
that I'd give him time.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.049
Is there time?

12:09.646 --> 12:10.729
Um...

12:10.730 --> 12:13.553
Yeah, of course.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.722
Can he cure me?

12:16.778 --> 12:18.680
I'm sure he can.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.476
I just want to get better.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.982
Tell Joseph that I'm ready.

12:31.668 --> 12:36.414
Ask him to let me sleep.
I'm begging you.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.414
And, Brian,

12:45.014 --> 12:46.916
thank you.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.972
Seen a ghost?

13:03.741 --> 13:05.826
She knew my name.

13:05.827 --> 13:08.946
She probably heard us talking
about you at some point.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.780
She's no fool.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.577
Um, she said to tell you

13:15.503 --> 13:18.880
that she needs sleep
and that she's ready.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.706
Excellent, that is a good sign.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.721
I really don't know if
I can do this, sir.

13:25.722 --> 13:30.878
If you think you're scared,
imagine how she feels, hmm?

13:31.894 --> 13:36.299
Besides, aren't you just
a little bit intrigued?

13:38.693 --> 13:40.736
Hey, you! You over there!

13:40.737 --> 13:44.232
Is he in? Is he in that house?

13:44.240 --> 13:48.986
I am going to go mad if
this sound does not stop!

13:49.078 --> 13:51.872
What's the point, exactly?

13:51.873 --> 13:55.652
Remember, "Cure one
patient, we cure mankind"?

13:55.877 --> 13:58.826
Jane Harper is that patient.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.923
If we can push our subject
to manifest negative energy

14:01.924 --> 14:04.326
in the form of
telekinetic activity,

14:05.261 --> 14:10.462
we can harvest that energy and
remove it, like extracting a tumor.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.091
We cure mental illness for good.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.516
Are you a skeptic, Brian?

14:18.775 --> 14:20.176
Pardon?

14:20.610 --> 14:22.853
Don't you think we can cure Harper?

14:25.114 --> 14:30.020
We can't have non-believers
in this house, Brian.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.197
It's a destructive energy

14:34.123 --> 14:36.696
in a constructive space.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.173
Not again.

14:43.174 --> 14:46.043
Harry, will you turn the
music off upstairs?

14:46.469 --> 14:48.929
Well, thank you and
good luck. I'm sorry.

14:48.930 --> 14:52.334
It won't happen again.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.382
You just clap.

15:01.943 --> 15:05.472
Hello, Jane. We've brought
something for you.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.366
You can put all your bad thoughts

15:09.367 --> 15:11.660
and negative energy
into the doll, Jane.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.860
Get rid of them, get
rid of them for good.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.658
Evey doesn't look like this.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.074
She's all wrong.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.907
Why don't you describe
her to me, hmm?

15:24.632 --> 15:26.079
This doll's dead,

15:27.593 --> 15:28.994
inside.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.332
That's what my parents
used to say about my eyes.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.381
They weren't my real parents.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.801
With each new family,
they'd sit me down,

15:40.106 --> 15:42.099
ever so nice,

15:43.317 --> 15:46.766
but I knew soon enough

15:47.864 --> 15:49.766
that they'd hate me too.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.353
That must have been
very painful for you.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.615
I scared them, all of them.

15:58.624 --> 16:02.278
You're not possessed, Jane.
You're just unwell.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.406
I just want to sleep,

16:06.466 --> 16:08.038
forever.

16:11.220 --> 16:15.056
Aren't you concerned that Jane
Harper will take her own life?

16:15.057 --> 16:18.226
That's why we keep her under
surveillance and medicated.

16:18.227 --> 16:22.731
So, why are you working on
this experiment, Harry?

16:22.732 --> 16:24.133
Me?

16:25.526 --> 16:27.473
Scientific pursuit.

16:27.862 --> 16:31.531
The equipment we're using is
cutting edge, engineer's dream.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.325
Help me!

16:50.510 --> 16:52.662
It's 95 over 70.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.508
So, how did you get into this?

17:01.687 --> 17:04.689
Initially my field was
abnormal psychology,

17:04.690 --> 17:07.608
which, despite the
frightening title,

17:07.609 --> 17:12.265
merely indicates the study of
behavior outside the norm.

17:13.156 --> 17:16.826
You run into a lot of charlatans, con
artists, and mental deficients, Brian,

17:16.827 --> 17:18.662
and I disproved them all.

17:18.663 --> 17:22.123
Then, there was David Q.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.776
Harry, lights.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.702
<i>Where are you, Mr. Gregor?</i>

17:32.468 --> 17:37.044
I think David used the
character of Mr. Gregor

17:37.139 --> 17:41.214
to explain the telekinetic
havoc his mind was wreaking.

17:41.269 --> 17:44.468
The same way Jane is
mentally sculpting Evey?

17:44.564 --> 17:46.136
Exactly.

17:46.983 --> 17:50.136
<i>Why is Mr. Gregor doing
these things, David?</i>

17:50.152 --> 17:55.058
<i>I don't know. Mother
says he's evil.</i>

17:55.575 --> 17:57.568
<i>What do you think he is?</i>

17:57.910 --> 18:00.287
<i>He's bad. So am I!</i>

18:00.288 --> 18:03.456
<i>Mr. Gregor is make-believe!
Your mind is creating him.</i>

18:03.457 --> 18:05.905
<i>You can get rid of him.
I can help you!</i>

18:18.347 --> 18:21.933
Mr. Gregor was a character
from a bedtime story

18:21.934 --> 18:24.102
David's father used to tell him.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.021
His parents must feel so guilty.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.424
What happened to David Q.?

18:28.774 --> 18:32.929
He was improving with my
help, but his mother,

18:32.987 --> 18:36.031
a religious woman,
terminated the sessions.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.699
We lost touch.

18:37.700 --> 18:41.369
I've heard he's living a
relatively normal life somewhere.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.494
Hello, Joseph.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.999
Gentlemen.

18:59.889 --> 19:03.338
Why do I get the impression this
is about to become unpleasant?

19:05.519 --> 19:07.136
We have to move Jane.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.230
- What?
- Why?

19:09.231 --> 19:11.804
They've pulled the funding
for the experiment.

19:12.026 --> 19:14.474
Bloody cowards!

19:16.072 --> 19:18.474
Ah, they're dead already anyway.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.480
Krissi, Harry...

19:22.703 --> 19:25.121
You can leave the experiment
or see this through.

19:25.122 --> 19:28.321
Either way I'll understand.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.905
No, we're with you, Joseph.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.373
All the way.

19:38.386 --> 19:41.388
Cameraman, I'm not well off.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.632
I won't have much left for film.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.968
I'll use cheaper stock.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.674
After all, I'm starting
to be a bit intrigued.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.319
Ah, it's for the best.
Come on, let's pack.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.846
Hmm.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.802
Do you like it?

20:37.695 --> 20:39.597
If it makes me better.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.772
Let's get...

20:46.579 --> 20:49.152
Yeah, one of all of us.

20:56.881 --> 21:01.206
Okay, should we go in? I got you.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.198
Just be careful.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.269
EMF scanner.

22:34.270 --> 22:39.267
And there's one in each corner and
one on the table. Five in total.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.110
Basically, they pick
up minute changes

22:42.111 --> 22:44.730
in electromagnetic energy fields.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.229
I borrowed them from the
Engineering Department.

22:48.576 --> 22:51.119
So if we can connect
Harper's mental activity,

22:51.120 --> 22:53.739
which is recorded
on the EEG machine,

22:55.541 --> 22:59.662
to telekinetic events, then...

23:03.716 --> 23:06.843
So if Evey's made
of negative energy,

23:06.844 --> 23:08.887
then this should
help us identify...

23:08.888 --> 23:12.633
Very good, Brian, very good.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.426
- Are we ready?
- Yeah.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.681
Here we go.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.978
We just want to ask
Evey some questions.

23:33.203 --> 23:36.857
Come on, Evey. Come out.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.197
Come play with us.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.366
One knock for yes, two for no.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.919
God, please, Evey.

23:53.015 --> 23:55.258
Why won't she speak to us?

23:56.685 --> 23:58.712
Damn it, Jane!

23:59.188 --> 24:01.306
I'm trying, Joseph.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.597
Try harder.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.772
So, how do we assess our progress?

24:13.494 --> 24:16.113
How do I assess our progress?

24:16.538 --> 24:21.444
Patience and courage.
Evey will slowly come to life.

24:21.543 --> 24:24.921
If we survive, we
win a Nobel Prize.

24:24.922 --> 24:27.256
Wait, is there a chance we won't?

24:27.257 --> 24:28.508
Win?

24:28.509 --> 24:29.884
Survive.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.878
There's always a chance.

24:32.054 --> 24:36.300
"Security is a superstition.
It does not exist in nature.

24:36.642 --> 24:39.978
"Life's either a daring
adventure or nothing."

24:39.979 --> 24:41.729
Einstein?

24:41.730 --> 24:43.757
Helen Keller.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.403
Mate, just put it in the bottom
corner. Have you got it?

26:07.399 --> 26:09.267
To brighten things.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.475
Thank you.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.317
You feeling okay?

26:17.409 --> 26:19.402
I'm a disappointment.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.067
I'm taking too long.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.575
I have to find Evey.

26:28.170 --> 26:29.571
<i>Slowly...</i>

26:31.840 --> 26:34.709
<i>Go down into the darkness.</i>

26:35.677 --> 26:38.179
Allow the total
relaxation you're feeling

26:38.180 --> 26:41.709
to plunge you through
any mental chaos.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.261
Deeper.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.090
Ready.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.430
Deeper.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.603
She's in alpha wave state.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.518
How are you feeling?

27:01.620 --> 27:05.775
Lost, alone...

27:05.791 --> 27:08.193
But you're not alone, are you?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.954
Peer into the darkness.

27:12.214 --> 27:16.869
There's something there with
you, isn't there? What is it?

27:20.139 --> 27:22.712
Say it, "I'm not alone."

27:23.892 --> 27:26.060
- I am alone.
- Say it!

27:26.061 --> 27:29.806
I'm a failure. Everyone hates me.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.319
I want to die.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.314
Jane, if you're not going to try
you can go back to the chemical...

27:39.908 --> 27:41.367
- Jesus.
- What was that?

27:41.368 --> 27:43.744
The EMF, sensor two.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.746
Something knocked the
camera out of my hand!

27:45.747 --> 27:46.873
I had a firm grip on it.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.291
- Shh, shh!
- Oh, my God, it happened.

27:48.292 --> 27:51.912
Evey was here? Why
didn't you tell us?

27:55.257 --> 27:57.159
She was playing.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.082
Bring her back.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.420
Jane, bring her back.

28:09.605 --> 28:13.191
We made progress tonight.
A toast. Brian, you make it.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.567
I don't know...

28:14.568 --> 28:16.185
Be quick with it now. No thinking.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.528
Come on.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.930
To Jane.

28:19.281 --> 28:20.978
To Jane!

28:21.116 --> 28:22.408
I think he's falling in love.

28:22.409 --> 28:23.743
My, my.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.578
He'll be bringing her flowers next.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.618
Harry.

28:42.721 --> 28:46.045
Brian, she's had her
sleep. Keep her up.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.477
I love you.

28:49.478 --> 28:54.224
Now why would you need to ruin the
mood with that filthy, filthy word?

28:54.233 --> 28:55.566
Good night, Brian.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.139
Good night.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.330
Ow!

29:30.519 --> 29:31.966
Bed broke.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.105
Sorry about that.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.507
I'm not.

29:36.358 --> 29:37.858
Good night, Brian.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.390
You look tired. Why
don't you go to bed.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.222
I'll take over.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.049
Harry.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.673
Come see this.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.678
Can you see her?

30:59.733 --> 31:02.135
Krissi. Krissi!

31:05.864 --> 31:08.141
I need the lights.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.118
Is that enough?

31:11.119 --> 31:12.520
Yeah, yeah, perfect.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.121
Now you feel better, don't you?

31:24.257 --> 31:26.125
May we see her, Jane?

31:32.307 --> 31:33.879
She's pretty.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.887
So, why are you doing this to her?

31:38.980 --> 31:40.472
Hmm?

31:40.482 --> 31:44.887
Is Evey losing her hair?
Is she sick?

31:44.903 --> 31:46.896
Is she someone you hated?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.808
Did she hurt you when
you were little?

31:50.909 --> 31:53.152
Jane, please try to remember.

31:56.164 --> 31:59.408
Hey, stop it, stop it!

32:02.462 --> 32:05.581
You must let us help you. Okay?

32:07.342 --> 32:10.871
Help me? God, no.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.089
No one can help me.

32:14.015 --> 32:16.088
They act like I'm invisible.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.345
Do you want to see me disappear?

32:21.523 --> 32:24.676
Sure. Weak pulse.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.766
Brian, look at this.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.531
You see that?

32:30.532 --> 32:32.354
What is that?

32:32.993 --> 32:34.994
Looks like she's been
scratching something.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.396
Shh!

32:50.010 --> 32:52.504
Jane, Jane! Harry!

32:52.512 --> 32:54.289
Jane, Jane!

32:54.973 --> 32:57.296
Come on, Krissi, come on,
get up. Come on!

32:57.559 --> 33:00.186
- What is with you?
- Do you want to meet Evey?

33:00.187 --> 33:02.305
- What?
- She's inside me right now.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.218
- Jane.
- Take me.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.360
- Jane!
- She's inside me.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.154
- Feel Evey. You can even touch her.
- What are you doing?

33:10.155 --> 33:11.572
Stop! Stop!

33:11.573 --> 33:13.395
- Let him go.
- Coward.

33:16.912 --> 33:20.657
Take your hands out of his
trousers now, please.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.905
Thank you.

33:36.389 --> 33:40.100
I'm sorry. It wasn't
what it looked like.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.435
I know.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.351
I don't understand what's going on.

33:48.443 --> 33:52.473
It's obvious. She's aware
of your feelings for her,

33:53.031 --> 33:56.784
which could be very
dangerous for you.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.186
Coward.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.943
Better go.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.698
<i>Coward!</i>

34:18.139 --> 34:19.882
It's a job.

34:20.058 --> 34:23.476
You can quit anytime. She's
not your responsibility.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.024
Come on.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.780
She's here.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.955
EMF hit, sensors one through five.

35:37.510 --> 35:40.054
Like you to let us talk to
Evey. Will you do that?

35:40.055 --> 35:42.056
One knock for yes, two for no.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.725
EMF sensor five.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.003
- It's so hot.
- She's right there, guys.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.437
There's a fire.

35:48.438 --> 35:51.387
No, no, there's no fire.
You're perfectly safe.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.302
Krissi, pass me a candle.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.476
Here you are.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.269
Is Evey afraid of fire?

36:14.756 --> 36:16.157
Joseph...

36:18.468 --> 36:20.010
Stop! Stop!

36:21.137 --> 36:22.763
Cameraman, you've scared her off!

36:22.764 --> 36:24.290
We've lost it.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.842
Do that again and you are gone.

37:19.487 --> 37:20.888
Hello?

37:24.993 --> 37:26.565
It's open.

39:48.511 --> 39:49.912
Jane?

39:55.435 --> 39:56.836
Jane?

40:25.298 --> 40:27.120
Jane? Jane?

40:28.718 --> 40:31.086
What's that? What have you done?

40:31.471 --> 40:34.875
Krissi! Hurry, Krissi!

40:35.558 --> 40:38.727
I don't know. She's
lost three more pounds.

40:38.728 --> 40:41.313
She's painting her body with blood.

40:41.314 --> 40:45.844
She's mutilating herself. I'm
sorry, she must see a doctor.

40:46.194 --> 40:47.694
Do you always do this?

40:47.695 --> 40:49.438
Do what?

40:52.075 --> 40:55.869
Retreat when you're on the
brink of something meaningful.

40:55.870 --> 40:58.898
I don't know, I've never
thought about it like that...

41:02.835 --> 41:05.408
There's so much you can accomplish.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.969
Evey and I could be friends.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.480
I think I must have always
been naked as a child,

41:32.615 --> 41:34.938
my clothes always off.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.189
Do I look like a woman to you?

41:40.748 --> 41:43.822
Every time I look in the
mirror I see a little girl.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.371
I want to see a woman.

41:50.299 --> 41:51.871
Are you shy?

41:55.221 --> 41:57.669
Don't you want to touch me?

42:02.979 --> 42:04.813
Let me get you out of here.

42:04.814 --> 42:06.557
And go where?

42:06.941 --> 42:10.515
Another asylum? More doctors?

42:11.279 --> 42:14.228
There must be something else we
can do for you other than this.

42:14.282 --> 42:15.574
This?

42:15.575 --> 42:17.147
The Experiment.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.692
You know I can't leave.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.164
Why not?

42:22.165 --> 42:24.033
Joseph would be upset.

42:26.002 --> 42:28.245
You shouldn't worry about him.

42:28.588 --> 42:32.538
He rescued me. He saved me.

42:33.801 --> 42:38.047
From myself and the likes of you.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.141
Camera operators?

42:41.142 --> 42:42.543
Men.

42:43.644 --> 42:47.048
Silly, frustrated, violent men,

42:47.190 --> 42:51.561
who want to touch you, but can't
or won't, so they torment you.

42:52.153 --> 42:56.103
Not your body, but your
heart and your feelings.

42:56.532 --> 42:59.276
And they set you on
fire to watch you burn.

43:00.495 --> 43:02.897
Is Joseph that kind of man?

43:03.664 --> 43:05.190
Are you?

43:18.012 --> 43:22.087
Double it. We're on the verge.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.678
- Here you go, Jane.
- No.

43:26.979 --> 43:28.551
Are you sure?

43:37.240 --> 43:39.984
Krissi. Harry.

43:40.201 --> 43:41.602
Harry.

43:42.203 --> 43:43.604
Brian.

43:43.704 --> 43:45.777
- You want me to...
- Yes.

43:46.707 --> 43:48.108
Okay.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.122
You said there was a fire.

44:05.059 --> 44:06.802
There are flames,

44:09.355 --> 44:10.802
everywhere.

44:14.402 --> 44:18.181
The roof, the walls...

44:22.368 --> 44:23.940
It's so hot.

44:26.455 --> 44:28.027
So hot.

44:30.084 --> 44:31.656
So hot.

44:35.214 --> 44:36.615
Evey.

44:38.301 --> 44:40.203
Evey, it's burning!

44:41.596 --> 44:43.498
What do you see, Jane?

44:44.307 --> 44:45.959
Tell us.

44:48.769 --> 44:52.719
We can't get out. We're locked in.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.174
Who?

44:55.276 --> 44:57.019
Who's locked in?

45:01.616 --> 45:03.233
Burning...

45:03.951 --> 45:07.321
Burning, burning...

45:09.957 --> 45:15.158
Burning! Burning! Burning, Evey!

45:17.006 --> 45:18.999
Oh! Ice, Krissi, ice!

45:19.675 --> 45:21.426
She needs a doctor.

45:21.427 --> 45:23.094
No, no doctor.

45:23.095 --> 45:24.997
Krissi, she needs...

45:25.139 --> 45:26.586
No doctor.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.767
I have ice!

45:30.770 --> 45:32.262
- Jane!
- Oh, my God!

45:39.946 --> 45:41.655
Did we get it on film?

45:41.656 --> 45:43.281
I think I got it, whatever it is.

45:43.282 --> 45:45.367
And what do we think it was?

45:45.368 --> 45:47.736
Some friggin' exorcist shit.

45:47.828 --> 45:50.163
It's what you always said.

45:50.164 --> 45:52.415
She manifested her negative energy.

45:52.416 --> 45:54.376
Whatever it was, it scared
the hell out of me.

45:54.377 --> 45:58.077
You're scared because you can't
explain what you've seen.

45:58.339 --> 46:02.915
So your mind falls back on the
stories that scared you as a child.

46:03.219 --> 46:04.844
Evil spirits and such.

46:04.845 --> 46:06.554
How do you explain it?

46:06.555 --> 46:08.628
I'd call it "teleplasm."

46:08.641 --> 46:12.386
- That was teleplasm? Bloody hell.
- Mm-hmm.

46:12.395 --> 46:15.594
The next step is transference.

46:15.856 --> 46:19.734
Once Jane's psychic energy
has found a new home,

46:19.735 --> 46:21.861
we isolate it and get
rid of it for good.

46:21.862 --> 46:23.263
What, now?

46:23.364 --> 46:26.741
The psychic floodgates have opened
and we are driving through.

46:26.742 --> 46:28.985
She's hurt, tired.

46:29.328 --> 46:32.277
She needs rest and food.

46:32.665 --> 46:35.113
Even God rested on the seventh day.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.334
Hmm.

46:36.335 --> 46:37.782
Interesting.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.172
Krissi?

46:41.173 --> 46:44.998
Well, obviously, I want
to go on, Joseph, but

46:45.720 --> 46:47.622
maybe she's earned a rest.

46:48.222 --> 46:49.306
Harry?

46:49.307 --> 46:50.754
Yeah.

46:51.767 --> 46:53.510
Well, it's unanimous.

46:55.396 --> 46:58.766
Let's give our subject
a well-deserved break.

47:03.446 --> 47:04.972
Come and play.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.241
You got to get him out first.

47:08.242 --> 47:09.643
You ready?

47:12.580 --> 47:14.789
- Yes, that's how it's really done.
- That was pathetic.

47:14.790 --> 47:17.568
Cut that. Cut that out.

47:44.737 --> 47:47.014
We need to speak with Evey.

47:47.156 --> 47:49.616
She can come and stay right here.

47:49.617 --> 47:52.160
Right here inside this doll.

47:52.161 --> 47:57.317
It can be hers and she can
stay there anytime she wants.

48:02.922 --> 48:04.824
I can't find her.

48:04.965 --> 48:07.467
Where are you hiding tonight, Evey?

48:07.468 --> 48:09.260
She's not hiding. She's lost.

48:11.639 --> 48:13.586
She doesn't sound lost.

48:15.142 --> 48:17.894
Are you going to come down and
talk to us? We want to meet you.

48:18.979 --> 48:21.256
- God.
- Stay down!

48:21.315 --> 48:22.716
Joseph...

48:32.034 --> 48:36.234
Tell her to come in, Jane.
We just want to talk to her.

48:36.831 --> 48:38.832
Tell her to come in
and play with us.

48:38.833 --> 48:41.076
Play nice.

48:41.502 --> 48:43.028
She's here.

48:50.386 --> 48:52.754
How big you've grown, little girl.

48:52.972 --> 48:56.683
Big enough to walk. If
you're big enough to walk

48:56.684 --> 48:59.462
you're big enough
to talk. Speak to us!

49:00.688 --> 49:03.231
Please, we just want to be friends.

49:03.232 --> 49:04.929
She knows you're lying.

49:05.234 --> 49:07.477
What can we do to calm you down?

49:15.035 --> 49:16.244
Where's she gone?

49:16.245 --> 49:17.771
I don't know.

49:19.373 --> 49:20.748
Evey!

49:23.335 --> 49:25.112
Come on. Come on.

49:31.594 --> 49:34.122
Brian, get out of the way!

49:35.931 --> 49:39.926
If you're her friend, you must
leave her be! Let Jane heal.

49:41.020 --> 49:42.729
Tell her, Jane.

49:42.730 --> 49:44.439
Leave, Evey, please.

49:44.440 --> 49:45.690
Say it like you mean it!

49:45.691 --> 49:46.900
Please, Evey!

49:57.912 --> 49:59.859
Have you got something to show us?

50:00.080 --> 50:03.700
Joseph. Joseph.

50:20.768 --> 50:22.101
It bit me!

50:22.102 --> 50:24.300
- Evey's gone, she's gone!
- Are you okay?

50:24.313 --> 50:26.056
It bit me!

50:31.111 --> 50:35.982
<i>Burning! Burning! Burning, Evey!</i>

50:38.619 --> 50:40.737
<i>God, Jesus Christ!</i>

50:49.004 --> 50:50.701
<i>She needs a doctor!</i>

51:10.943 --> 51:14.362
What happens to Jane now
that Evey refuses to leave?

51:14.363 --> 51:16.765
Maybe we burn down the house.

51:16.865 --> 51:20.064
Maybe that's what Harper's
been talking about. Kill Evey.

51:20.661 --> 51:24.440
And it'll be a wrap. Good ending.
Yeah, very dramatic.

51:25.165 --> 51:26.691
I'm sorry,

51:27.293 --> 51:30.412
are you insinuating that we're
making this whole thing up?

51:30.546 --> 51:33.006
That this is somehow staged?

51:33.007 --> 51:36.926
Professor hires gullible local
cameraman to make himself famous.

51:38.178 --> 51:42.515
Don't be absurd. What
about Jane's burns?

51:42.516 --> 51:45.760
A bit of acid on the
doll, basic chemistry.

51:45.811 --> 51:47.520
I did go to school.

51:47.521 --> 51:50.565
What about the electromagnetic
field readings, the heartbeat?

51:50.566 --> 51:52.150
It's simple enough to fake.

51:52.151 --> 51:53.401
And the bite?

51:53.402 --> 51:56.772
Self-inflicted when we weren't
looking. And the knocks...

51:59.575 --> 52:02.118
Evey? Evey, are you there?

52:03.245 --> 52:06.205
So you break up something under
the table, a metal supported leg.

52:06.206 --> 52:07.707
"Telekinetic event."

52:07.708 --> 52:10.501
So what you're saying is
that Joseph is a fraud,

52:10.502 --> 52:13.254
and Harry and I are fools, idiots.

52:13.255 --> 52:17.342
No, I'm saying this isn't gonna
hold up as scientific proof.

52:17.343 --> 52:19.594
And in the process, we've
tortured a human being,

52:19.595 --> 52:22.669
for no other reason than her
sick desire to please him.

52:25.225 --> 52:26.751
<i>What are you doing?</i>

52:29.605 --> 52:32.065
Yes, the doll. We saw smoke.

52:32.066 --> 52:35.318
They can say it's a fake, that
we hid something in here.

52:38.238 --> 52:39.685
Oh, my God!

52:40.240 --> 52:41.449
Jane?

52:42.951 --> 52:45.399
- Jane. Oh, God.
- Jane. Oh, my God.

52:49.375 --> 52:51.084
She faking this too?

52:57.091 --> 53:00.370
I understand this
has been difficult.

53:01.470 --> 53:05.170
It's human nature to
question and be skeptical.

53:06.266 --> 53:07.713
I'm sorry.

53:09.561 --> 53:11.312
I didn't mean to cause...

53:11.313 --> 53:13.681
We're depending on you, Brian. Hmm?

53:15.109 --> 53:18.353
We need every detail.

53:20.781 --> 53:22.933
I'm okay now.

53:28.247 --> 53:29.648
Here you go.

53:31.834 --> 53:33.084
It's okay.

53:33.085 --> 53:36.204
She will need your strength
for what lies ahead.

53:37.131 --> 53:38.506
What's that?

53:38.507 --> 53:40.159
Isolate Evey.

53:40.843 --> 53:42.495
Turn her off.

53:56.150 --> 53:58.473
Hold still, just a
few more seconds.

54:12.833 --> 54:14.576
Please try not to move.

54:31.018 --> 54:33.420
Focus your eyes at
the ceiling, okay?

54:34.813 --> 54:38.467
Stay relaxed. Stay
still, that's important.

54:39.193 --> 54:41.391
She's ready.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.355
Find Evey.

55:06.970 --> 55:09.623
Don't move. Two,

55:10.557 --> 55:11.958
three.

55:19.817 --> 55:22.891
Photographs, Soviet technology.

55:23.111 --> 55:26.531
Captures the bioelectric energy
fields around living organisms.

55:26.532 --> 55:30.027
- Their aura?
- Their bioelectric energy fields.

55:30.410 --> 55:33.484
These are Jane in a
neutral state of mind.

55:37.793 --> 55:41.697
These, when she's
starting to manifest.

55:51.265 --> 55:52.666
Evey.

55:54.643 --> 55:56.215
It's ghastly.

55:57.396 --> 55:59.469
So is this proof?

55:59.898 --> 56:03.302
Using technology that
exists, cameraman,

56:04.444 --> 56:06.346
it's the best we can do.

56:11.451 --> 56:13.603
See what you've made, Jane?

56:16.790 --> 56:20.865
You made her. You
can get rid of her.

56:23.463 --> 56:25.865
I don't want to get rid of her.

56:26.633 --> 56:29.035
You can't possibly mean that.

56:30.596 --> 56:32.168
You can't.

56:37.269 --> 56:38.921
Joseph.

56:41.106 --> 56:42.678
It's okay.

56:43.984 --> 56:46.182
He cares about us.

56:46.945 --> 56:48.346
He does.

56:48.488 --> 56:52.017
Joseph, I'm scared.

56:53.493 --> 56:55.036
It means you're alive.

56:55.037 --> 56:58.065
You'll be safe with someone
else, another family.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.072
And I'll be sane.

57:09.134 --> 57:11.753
I'm not fond of feeling scared.

57:16.350 --> 57:19.219
Usually, I scare people.

57:27.110 --> 57:29.012
I want to feel good.

57:29.529 --> 57:31.397
Not tonight, Krissi.

57:34.868 --> 57:37.270
We have to conserve our energy.

57:39.456 --> 57:41.073
Go back to bed.

57:45.045 --> 57:46.446
Go on.

58:42.936 --> 58:44.337
What's wrong?

58:46.606 --> 58:48.007
Nothing.

58:48.275 --> 58:50.928
You've been distant all
week, something's up.

58:51.361 --> 58:55.982
I just feel like we're
living on a spaceship.

58:56.742 --> 59:00.146
There's no TV, the
phones don't work.

59:00.370 --> 59:01.579
I've stopped going to lectures,

59:01.580 --> 59:03.027
I haven't read a newspaper in...

59:04.458 --> 59:06.030
It's a prison.

59:08.128 --> 59:11.372
It's a prison and we
are her prisoners.

59:12.132 --> 59:13.549
This has gone on long enough.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.134
What, you mean you and me?

59:15.135 --> 59:18.334
No, you idiot! The Experiment.

59:18.805 --> 59:20.639
Are both of you blind?

59:20.640 --> 59:23.964
Joseph is in love with Jane Harper.

59:25.145 --> 59:27.646
He's wants to cure her
so he can have her.

59:27.647 --> 59:29.299
Don't be a child!

59:29.483 --> 59:31.055
Piss off.

59:34.237 --> 59:35.638
Krissi!

59:41.411 --> 59:45.122
I had nothing to do with this,
I swear. I was asleep.

59:45.123 --> 59:47.249
You couldn't have been
asleep. That's impossible.

59:47.250 --> 59:48.542
She heard you laugh.

59:48.543 --> 59:49.835
I don't control Evey.

59:49.836 --> 59:51.003
You made Evey.

59:51.004 --> 59:55.500
This is where your grand
hypothesis meets reality, Joseph.

59:55.842 --> 59:59.637
What's the bloody plan? Hmm?
Do you even have one?

59:59.638 --> 01:00:02.431
The plan's what it's always
been. Cure Jane Harper.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.926
She tried to kill me!

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:09.688
Your tart tried to kill me.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:13.844
Jesus, Joseph. Are you
screwing both of them?

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:16.028
Is that part of the Experiment?

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:19.273
You can go to hell, all of you.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.773
Harry, go help her.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.334
So, why couldn't she
have been sleeping?

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:35.115
Because that would mean she could
manifest whilst unconscious.

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:41.705
And that is, well,

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.208
unexpected.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.135
I'm sorry, Harry.

01:00:57.737 --> 01:01:00.231
You're all in love
with her, you know?

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:04.910
You, Joseph and Brian...
Brian most of all.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:07.313
Come on, Krissi. Get real.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:11.067
You all think you can save her.

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:30.504
Power's out, just
checked the fuse box.

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:33.355
- Brian! Brian!
- Sir?

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.850
Bring the light. Jane's missing.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:37.852
- What?
- Come on!

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:41.435
Where's she gone?

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.116
She's missing. If I knew
the answer to that,

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:46.144
she wouldn't be missing, would she?

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:57.280
What's that?

01:01:57.923 --> 01:02:00.325
Help me!

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.961
- Jane!
- Jane!

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:06.297
Jane, where are you?

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:12.045
Jane?

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:19.389
Jane!

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:22.980
Open the door!

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:43.159
Be careful.

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:49.007
Krissi, go on. Slowly.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.923
We don't know what's in here.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:54.925
Sir, sir.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:56.673
Jane?

01:02:57.983 --> 01:02:59.149
Jane?

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.485
Shine the light,
goddamn it. I can't see.

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:03.263
- Jane?
- Jane!

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.598
Jane.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.442
Jane.

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:20.621
- Where is she?
- Jane.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.870
Odd, there's a toy.
What? Who's is it?

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:31.628
It's like the painting, on
the wall in Jane's room.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:37.187
You okay?

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:38.714
Goddamn it!

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:41.233
- Oh, God, Joseph.
- It's pitch black in here!

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:42.635
Sorry.

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:45.638
Jane!

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:51.565
- God, what is this?
- Jane? Jane?

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:56.274
Oh, my God, she's not here.
Can we please get out of here?

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:58.025
Go on.

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:04.006
Jesus! It's okay,
it's okay, I'm sorry.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:06.175
- We need to stick together!
- I'm sorry.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:07.577
Oh, God!

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:10.171
- Jane, please.
- Jane!

01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:16.086
We understand this has been
difficult, but we're your family now!

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:20.006
What's that?

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:29.975
What are you doing?
Why are the lights off?

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:33.148
Where's Evey?

01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:37.122
- What was that?
- What's that?

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.248
It's coming from there.

01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:39.696
What was that?

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.874
She's right in front of you.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:53.548
What's wrong, darling?

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:00.854
Why are you upset?

01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:02.314
Get in close, go on.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:04.558
You don't want to leave this house?

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:06.974
I understand.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.148
Do you need me to hold you?

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:14.731
It's okay, love, I'm here.

01:05:16.121 --> 01:05:17.818
Don't be afraid.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.320
What's going on? Jane, Jane!

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.573
Put it out! Put it out quickly!

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:28.382
Oh, my God, what is that?

01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:29.750
What is that?

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.428
What was that?

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:43.647
It's a sigil.

01:05:43.648 --> 01:05:45.274
A what?

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.177
A sigil.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.805
A sign of devil worship.

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:55.701
Which one of you idiots
put this into her mind?

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:59.163
Will you please just
consider the possibility

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:01.282
that Jane didn't create Evey?

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:03.709
Okay, that maybe Evey came from...

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.453
Somewhere else?

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:09.381
What came from somewhere else,

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:12.456
is the idea of the fucking occult

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:15.872
to a patient who is
highly suggestible!

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:18.208
So, I ask you again,

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.560
which one of you was it?

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:24.965
What if it didn't
come from any of us?

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:29.568
What if she's just a
vessel or a conduit?

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:31.570
She needs to go to the hospital.

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:34.656
Try to control your hysteria,
Kristina, it's beneath you.

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:37.326
- She's just expressing what she thinks...
- No one's asking you, Harry!

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:40.370
Don't talk to us like we're
children. We are colleagues.

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:42.247
Then think before you
speak, colleague.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:45.822
With each paranormal event, we learn
more about how to eradicate it!

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:50.923
To probe like scientists,
not school girls.

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:52.966
That is so incredibly sexist.

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:55.260
Perhaps it doesn't fit
our hypothesis exactly.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:57.346
Well, not if she's
possessed, it doesn't!

01:06:57.347 --> 01:06:58.999
I can't be.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.635
We made her, didn't we, Joseph?

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:09.516
And we can purge her.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:14.181
You believe that with all
your heart, don't you?

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.784
We can stop this experiment
right now if you wish to.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:20.186
No.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.371
I don't want to hear another word

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:26.026
of this superstitious nonsense
uttered in this house again.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:31.371
If any of you are too frightened,

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:33.541
well, you can leave.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.790
I am too frightened.

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:40.206
We should go back to Oxford.

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:42.474
Salvage what's left of the term.

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:43.876
What about Jane?

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:46.311
I'm sorry.

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:49.306
We gave her a break,
now we need one.

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:02.027
Have you seen this sigil before?

01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:06.290
Does it mean anything to you?

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:08.193
I can't remember.

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:11.237
Try, Jane, it's important.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:17.827
Before I came here,

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:21.205
I was never comfortable
with who I was.

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:24.921
Have you ever felt like that?

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:27.435
You ever heard someone
call out your name,

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:29.680
but you couldn't recognize
it as your own?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.357
Or looked at old
photographs of yourself,

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:34.600
but you couldn't
recognize your face?

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:39.439
I felt like that for as
long as I can remember.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:48.361
Don't lose faith in Joseph,

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.867
or in Evey.

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:54.363
Or in me.

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.371
We need you.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:07.893
For the first time in my life,

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:10.638
I think there's finally a
way for me to be happy.

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:14.966
Evey's making that happen.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:19.893
- We can't.
- Why not?

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:22.032
Not yet.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.408
Brian?

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.231
Not until you're well.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:40.341
Do you think Evey will ever
leave Jane Harper alone?

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:42.086
Whatever Evey is.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.163
Screw Evey.

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:18.442
Jane.

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:21.153
Jane.

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:25.287
I need to leave.

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:29.503
I'll be back as soon
as I can. Alright?

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.175
- Do you understand?
- Does she understand what?

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:41.177
I have to go to the film
lab, get more stock.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:43.551
It might take me a while.

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:45.777
Oh.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:47.350
Okay.

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:51.396
Take your time.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:33.225
You.

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:37.230
You're the guy with the camera
working for Joseph Coupland.

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:44.571
Listen to you, nothing to say just like
everyone in Joseph's inner circle.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:48.081
Tell me, have you already been
indoctrinated by the quiet ones?

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:50.592
You must have killed her by now.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:54.088
You know, killing a young woman is
a wonderful way to create a ghost.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.047
Harry! It's hot!

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.287
Harry!

01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:07.504
Krissi!

01:16:15.529 --> 01:16:19.240
She needs to be locked
up in an asylum!

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:22.327
Sedated around the clock! Right?

01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:23.870
When you leave a haunted house,

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:25.413
the spirit isn't
meant to follow you.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:26.664
Keep it rational, Harry.

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:28.191
Rational?

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:30.410
- Now Evey's...
- Cameraman.

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:32.530
What took you so long?

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:38.877
They called themselves "Lilitu."

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:43.348
A cult, devoted to an ancient
demon worshipped by the Sumerians

01:16:43.349 --> 01:16:45.683
5,000 years before Christianity.

01:16:45.684 --> 01:16:47.256
Is this a joke?

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:49.521
Kristine nearly lost her life...

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:51.390
It's not a joke, it's Evey!

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:56.762
Evey?

01:16:57.488 --> 01:16:59.231
Evey Dwyer.

01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:02.826
As a child she exhibited
a gift for clairvoyance.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:06.704
Their leader Dr. Heinrich
Dwyer became convinced

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:09.608
that Evey could
reincarnate their idol.

01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:12.544
On June 6th, 1954,

01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:15.588
Dr. Dwyer claimed that Evey
had received a message that

01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:18.959
the Lilitu should lock
themselves inside this building.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:24.166
A massive fire destroyed the building
that night, killing everyone inside.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:26.625
Sir.

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.461
Sir.

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:33.932
Everyone including Evey Dwyer,

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:37.804
who was born with a
birthmark, a sigil.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.031
Evey Dwyer for some reason is

01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:44.367
a force that possesses Jane Harper.

01:17:44.368 --> 01:17:45.815
Oh, my God.

01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:49.982
Evey's gonna do to us what
she did to the Lilitu.

01:17:51.542 --> 01:17:54.411
- She's a...
- A demonic spirit? Hmm?

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:57.714
Evil begetting evil
for the sake of evil

01:17:57.715 --> 01:18:00.493
until the end of all times, ah?

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:03.712
Maybe even old Beelzebub himself.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:07.056
Do any of these
seriously work for you?

01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:08.308
They all work.

01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:09.835
Or...

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:11.269
Or what?

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:13.672
The rational explanation.

01:18:13.898 --> 01:18:16.191
That Jane somehow found
out about this cult.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.442
When she was four?

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:18.902
She heard it at the
breakfast table,

01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:20.361
her parents read it in a newspaper.

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:22.280
You make anything fit
into your hypothesis.

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:25.275
This only strengthens my
hypothesis actually, Harry.

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:28.286
When we ask Jane to go
deep she plucked the name

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:31.190
Evey Dwyer out of the deepest
recesses of her mind.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:32.957
That is what she is manifesting,

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:34.709
that is what you call
her "possession!"

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:39.206
God, you're the one who's possessed,
Coupland, by your own bullshit!

01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:44.628
Who is Evey Dwyer?

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.791
You know about her, don't you?

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:52.977
You found out about her or
somebody told you about her.

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:56.257
But you knew about her
before I found you.

01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:59.393
Answer me!

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.069
Hey, hey, hey!

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.562
Speak, damn you!

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:05.266
Oh!

01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:07.275
Brian!

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:10.578
Don't you touch her again.

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.606
But you will, won't you? Hmm?

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.041
Maybe you can screw
the truth out of her.

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:16.409
Whoa.

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:22.298
Krissi, Harry, stay or
leave, your choice.

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:25.635
You, cameraman or Lancelot,

01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:27.679
or whoever the hell
you think you are,

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.082
I want you and your
gear gone tonight.

01:19:31.016 --> 01:19:34.716
The footage handed
over. Every frame.

01:20:06.176 --> 01:20:07.748
What are we gonna do?

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:11.206
I'm leaving. I'm
taking Jane with me.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:12.557
He'll never let you.

01:20:12.558 --> 01:20:14.926
And even if he did, what then?

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:17.270
Find her help, professional help.

01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:20.356
What kind of help? An exorcist?

01:20:20.357 --> 01:20:23.886
She's not staying
here, not with him.

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:28.307
I need your help, I need
your car for starters.

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:34.484
Do you seriously believe that
Joseph still knows what he's doing?

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.954
It won't make a bit of difference.

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:16.913
<i>Get it out! Get it out!</i>

01:21:16.914 --> 01:21:18.566
David!

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:03.861
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.414
<i>Tell him to leave me alone, Daddy!</i>

01:22:08.424 --> 01:22:13.079
<i>I'm trying to find him,
Daddy. I can't find him.</i>

01:22:14.638 --> 01:22:17.086
<i>I don't want to do
this anymore, Daddy.</i>

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:29.018
<i>I'm sorry, David.</i>

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:34.933
<i>I'm trying to help you.</i>

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:08.717
If only I had more time with him.

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:12.653
- If only she...
- David Q. was your son.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.030
You deceived me!

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:18.106
No, Jane, try and understand.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.746
I've dedicated my
entire life to this.

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:24.445
I'm absolutely certain
that I am correct.

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:30.573
I can cure you. Please,
I'm begging you.

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:34.584
Believe in me.

01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:42.175
We believed in you, Joseph.

01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:44.143
You bastard!

01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:46.312
- You lied to us.
- You used me!

01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:48.397
- I gave you everything!
- Don't you touch her!

01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:52.268
Harry, stop! Harry,
Harry, Harry, stop it!

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:55.931
- Harry!
- What the fuck?

01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:12.497
Jesus!

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:14.468
- Get out of here!
- Krissi, wait!

01:24:19.805 --> 01:24:21.377
Krissi!

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:23.799
Harry!

01:24:29.106 --> 01:24:30.507
Krissi!

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:34.512
Krissi! Krissi!

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.348
Krissi, open up! Krissi!

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:39.907
Krissi, hold on, I'm coming!

01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:43.812
Krissi!

01:24:45.664 --> 01:24:47.156
Krissi!

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:50.034
It's got me!

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.906
No, no, no!

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:13.262
Krissi...

01:25:38.216 --> 01:25:39.742
Jane?

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:41.954
Jane?

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:49.294
She was the only survivor.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.688
They must have kept it
out of the newspapers

01:25:52.689 --> 01:25:55.467
so she'd have a chance
at a normal life.

01:25:57.194 --> 01:26:01.315
They changed her name.
A family took her in.

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:06.482
But the past became a bad dream
that lived in Evey like a virus.

01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:12.113
It drove her mad, she
forgot everything.

01:26:25.097 --> 01:26:27.124
You're Evey Dwyer.

01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:30.506
No wonder it's never leaving me.

01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:34.631
The truth was always there
right in front of me.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.342
I was born this way.

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:40.861
And that's how I'll die.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:43.685
No, don't do that, don't...

01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:46.951
All my life I felt there's
something burning inside of me.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:48.869
Just let me help you.

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:51.455
I don't deserve to live.
I killed all those people.

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:53.624
Come with me. I can help you.

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:56.369
I can't be saved!

01:27:04.803 --> 01:27:06.955
Jane, Jane!

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:08.999
I'm not Jane!

01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:21.470
You okay?

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:25.098
Is she out?

01:27:25.657 --> 01:27:27.400
I think so.

01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:49.922
The patient we knew as Jane
Harper was born Evey Dwyer.

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:53.517
As a child she was indoctrinated
into an occult group

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:57.422
and made to believe she could
reincarnate their idol.

01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:02.693
The damage that wrought
on her mind was severe.

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:05.696
The patient has expressed
on numerous occasions

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:08.449
a suicidal ideation, a death wish.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:09.867
Joseph, you're gonna kill her!

01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:14.774
Yes. But I'm going
to bring her back.

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:18.709
Ten cc's of adrenaline injected directly
into the heart should do the trick.

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:20.377
You're not gonna get
away with this.

01:28:20.378 --> 01:28:24.123
Of course I'm not gonna get
away with it! Are you insane?

01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:26.300
There are two dead
people in this house.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:27.510
Untie, just untie...

01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:28.958
Quiet!

01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:31.922
You have a part to play in this.

01:28:32.265 --> 01:28:35.669
You are the reason she's
going to want to come back.

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.923
- Jane, dear.
- Jane?

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.774
Can you hear me?

01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:43.317
Jane!

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:45.470
Can you hear my voice?

01:28:45.654 --> 01:28:47.571
Joseph...

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.815
Yes, dear, it's me.

01:28:50.033 --> 01:28:53.437
I want you to release
Evey one last time.

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:55.855
- Joseph, leave her alone!
- Be quiet!

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:58.666
I will take photograms of
your bioelectric activity

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:00.835
as Evey leaves your body forever.

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:02.795
We will have scientific evidence.

01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:04.994
It'll all be documented on film.

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.574
Jane!

01:29:09.427 --> 01:29:12.471
All right, here we go.

01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:13.873
Jane!

01:29:14.307 --> 01:29:16.809
Joseph, don't you dare.

01:29:16.810 --> 01:29:21.105
Joseph! Joseph! Joseph!

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.764
- Jane! Joseph!
- Shh!

01:29:29.656 --> 01:29:31.057
Jane.

01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:35.536
Just give her the shot,
Joseph! Get up!

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:41.750
Joseph, give her the adrenaline!

01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:44.529
Aren't you just a little
bit curious? Hmm?

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:48.541
Please just give her
the adrenaline now.

01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:51.051
Joseph, do it!

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:52.954
Not until Evey arrives.

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:40.001
Jane? Jane, just... What?

01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:04.450
Jesus, Jane, come on!

01:31:09.589 --> 01:31:11.241
Jane, Jane.

01:31:11.424 --> 01:31:14.418
Jane, look at me. It's me.

01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:27.678
Shh, shh.

01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:34.738
Jane.

01:31:34.739 --> 01:31:36.186
I'm sorry.

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:50.663
Jane. Jane.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:53.082
Jane, open the door.

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:55.384
Jane...

01:31:55.385 --> 01:31:56.786
Jane!

01:31:58.304 --> 01:32:00.422
Jane, open the door!

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:14.595
Jane!

01:32:15.113 --> 01:32:17.406
Open the door, Jane!

01:32:17.407 --> 01:32:19.605
Jane, please don't!

01:32:19.909 --> 01:32:22.277
Jane, talk to me!

01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:33.072
Jane! Jane!

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:50.548
<i>There was a fire.</i>

01:32:53.318 --> 01:32:55.311
How did they die, Brian?

01:32:57.155 --> 01:32:59.057
It's in here.

01:33:02.535 --> 01:33:04.562
In here.

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:07.039
It's in here.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.657
It's not in there.

01:33:08.875 --> 01:33:10.948
All the film's destroyed.

01:33:16.049 --> 01:33:18.747
You killed them, didn't you?

01:33:24.516 --> 01:33:27.715
Tell us what really happened.

01:33:39.197 --> 01:33:40.644
What is that?
