00:24.540 --> 00:26.320
Today is the day!

00:27.800 --> 00:30.000
Come here, you sexy little...

00:30.840 --> 00:32.520
Mwah!

00:34.760 --> 00:36.600
Mine.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.040
- Oh.
- So, today's the day!

00:50.720 --> 00:53.150
My novel's published in England.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.800
Well done. Have a burnt scone.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.840
Margo, please tell me you
know what's happening today.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.110
His novel's being published.

01:04.160 --> 01:08.910
So someone in a bookshop is opening
a box and putting copies on a shelf?

01:08.960 --> 01:12.350
- Well, yes, but...
- Did you expect people would carry you

01:12.400 --> 01:14.830
shoulder-high through the streets?

01:14.880 --> 01:17.950
Well, no, but traditionally
a family would...

01:18.000 --> 01:20.120
Most families...

01:22.160 --> 01:24.750
None of you have read it, have you?

01:24.800 --> 01:27.350
Tell me what happens, I'll
imagine all the adjectives.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.470
I've been busy at the market,
trying to rebuild our reputation

01:30.520 --> 01:32.600
after poisoning so many people.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.920
Thank you.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.350
Larry, please tell Margo her
religious instructor is here.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.430
Margo, nun lessons!

02:38.480 --> 02:41.190
- Spiro, did you read it?
- Yes. The first page.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.320
Why did you stop?

02:44.840 --> 02:48.630
- Good book.
- Ah. Pavlos, thank you at last.

02:48.680 --> 02:51.470
No, this. The Bible.

02:51.520 --> 02:55.630
Oh, but does it offer an evocative
dissection of adolescent sexuality

02:55.680 --> 02:57.830
across two continents, like mine?

02:57.880 --> 03:01.030
It offers everything.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.070
Right.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.590
- Gerry, still looking for otters?
- I need a female.

03:07.940 --> 03:09.150
For breeding!

03:09.200 --> 03:11.520
- Hm?
- Uh-hm.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.670
- What is your big seller?
- Well, it was gingerbread,

03:23.720 --> 03:27.030
but nobody's buying since
Larry added genitals.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.030
Any more threats from your landlady?

03:30.080 --> 03:32.920
No, but I know she's out there.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.790
Vasilia will always hate you

03:36.840 --> 03:39.670
as long as you let the Englishman woo you.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.710
Hugh is not wooing me.

03:41.760 --> 03:45.200
He's just glad of some
British company. That's all.

03:46.880 --> 03:53.830
~

03:53.880 --> 03:56.200
My new novel. Just published.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.830
~

03:59.880 --> 04:04.390
It's, er, about a young man who
struggles to find his place

04:04.440 --> 04:06.800
in British society after...

04:10.560 --> 04:19.820
- ~
- ~

04:22.880 --> 04:25.200
- Rather you than me, matey.
- ~

04:29.400 --> 04:32.590
I understand God the
Father and God the Son.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.550
- It's the Holy Ghost
I get stuck on. - Look!

04:35.600 --> 04:38.310
♪ Laa! Holy Goat!

04:38.360 --> 04:40.360
♪ Ahhhh

04:42.840 --> 04:45.390
Jesus would've laughed.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.070
Margo, I explain already --

04:48.120 --> 04:50.310
God three in one.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.520
Like a rope.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.510
Tell me about life in the monastery.

04:55.560 --> 05:00.790
It sounds so dreamy and quiet.... Shut up!

05:00.840 --> 05:03.310
In fact, we work hard.

05:03.360 --> 05:06.150
Now we make the liqueur from the kumquats.

05:06.200 --> 05:10.190
We add the kumquats to alcohol,
add the sugar -- not too much --

05:10.240 --> 05:13.080
drink some, sell the rest.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.120
Karpousia kai peponia! ~

05:30.320 --> 05:31.760
Poli oraia!

05:33.080 --> 05:35.760
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.950
The, er, Eccles cakes are
particularly delicious.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.550
I've made it clear to Vasilia
that I have no interest in her

05:44.600 --> 05:47.990
and if she threatens you,
I will have her arrested.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.630
Thank you. Oh, try the cheese.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.990
We milk the goats
ourselves, rather slowly.

05:54.040 --> 05:57.310
Please come for supper. Let me cosset you.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.560
It's really not necessary.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.440
I hear you nearly remarried.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.110
- Sven Lundblad.
- Yes.

06:06.160 --> 06:10.070
And so you'll understand why I don't
want to rush into another liaison.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.390
Of course. Of course.

06:12.440 --> 06:17.360
In case you hadn't noticed,
in Corfu nobody rushes,

06:18.160 --> 06:20.280
but they do let themselves have fun.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.950
Did we learn nothing from
the kumquat chutney fiasco?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.550
It's for a liqueur. They
make it at the monastery.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.750
- It only takes a week or two before it's
ready to sell. - That is a fabulous idea.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.990
Oh. We could work on it
together if you wanted.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.990
Terrific. Durrells' Kumquat Liqueur.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.390
- Extraordinarily good.
- No, no, wait. Durrells' Kumquat Liqueur --

06:47.440 --> 06:51.710
- your pleasure awaits.
- Damn. You are good with words.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.630
It's the monks' recipe,
you can't steal it.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.200
We're just showing that spiritual
journeys often end up at booze.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.990
- Where's Gerry?
- Up a tree?

07:03.040 --> 07:06.150
In a bush? Down a burrow?

07:06.200 --> 07:10.710
I loved your novel. It's bold and
delicate and beautifully modern.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.910
Thank you, Theo.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.190
But to be practical, they pay well

07:15.240 --> 07:17.550
for clever rhymes in greetings cards.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.200
Maybe you should write some of those.

07:26.560 --> 07:30.320
You'd never know you were a bachelor.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.150
- That would be
sarcasm, would it? - Yes.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.670
I picked that up from my
children, that and nits.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.430
- It was a very long time ago.
- Ah...

07:41.480 --> 07:45.190
Oh, well, I'll have a sip, but
actually, I've given up drinking.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.630
- Extraordinary. Why?
- Well, back in Bournemouth I became

07:48.680 --> 07:53.070
- a little too fond of gin.
- Oh, well.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.160
Mothers' ruin.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.920
Hm.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.710
You did this last time. Is
he in a cupboard or something?

08:08.760 --> 08:11.590
Yes, he is. Otherwise it's too loud.

08:11.640 --> 08:16.120
- How long has he been in there?
- Oh, he's fine. It's a big cupboard.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.230
Sven used to play the accordion.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.470
That put rather a strain
on our relationship.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.470
~

08:38.840 --> 08:42.750
Well, you're either crackers
or very self-confident.

08:42.799 --> 08:45.200
Which would you prefer?

08:50.620 --> 08:52.630
Did you have a good time with your friend?

08:52.680 --> 08:56.430
Oh. He's preposterous.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.200
I suppose he's rather amusing.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.790
Oh, Larry, I've been
thinking about your writing.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.790
Finally.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.470
- Are you enjoying it? - Well...
- That's probably the wrong word.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.510
Are you stimulated and provoked by it?

09:12.560 --> 09:16.190
No. I was thinking if nobody likes it,

09:16.240 --> 09:19.880
I'm sure Hugh would give you
a job at his olive press.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.320
You should be kinder to Larry.

09:50.960 --> 09:54.670
- Oh. What... - He's really sad
that nobody cares about his book,

09:54.720 --> 09:56.510
especially you.

09:56.560 --> 10:01.040
I can't even pretend to like it,
because I'm a bad liar, but...

10:02.800 --> 10:04.790
.. you're his mother.

10:04.840 --> 10:08.160
Gerry's not in his room. I
don't think he slept there.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.950
Gerry!

10:22.000 --> 10:23.840
Gerry!

10:27.200 --> 10:28.840
Gerry?

10:29.920 --> 10:33.190
Roger? Where could he be?

10:33.240 --> 10:36.310
I don't know, he's hardly here these days.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.710
- He's been away all night. He's only 11.
- He's 12, isn't he?

10:39.760 --> 10:41.840
Yeah. Do keep up.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.560
Gerry!

10:49.400 --> 10:51.040
Gerry?

10:54.600 --> 10:55.340
Gerry!

11:02.280 --> 11:05.830
We'll have to search for him.
Where do stupid bloody otters live?

11:05.880 --> 11:08.280
- In the sea?
- Roger.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.350
Oh. Gerry, where have you been?

11:12.400 --> 11:16.590
- It was a nice night, Roger and I
thought we'd just stay out. - Oh.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.480
Come here.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.640
Come on.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.710
I found a female otter.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.790
Come and see.

11:35.840 --> 11:40.640
- Look, Gerry, you need some order
in your life. At your age... - 12.

11:41.560 --> 11:44.040
.. you can't just run wild.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.190
And you, Larry,

11:47.240 --> 11:49.320
please talk to me.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.230
Let me make amends. What can I do?

11:53.280 --> 11:55.310
I don't know, be a different person?

11:55.360 --> 11:58.360
I'm sure I could help you
with your writing career.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.360
- And how are you going to do that?
- Well, I have an idea.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.710
You haven't, have you?

12:05.760 --> 12:09.160
No, but I'm very
resourceful, so I will have.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.790
So it's been pointed out recently

12:20.840 --> 12:24.440
that I may have been a bit
insensitive to your needs.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.240
Pointed out by Leslie, of all people.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.350
So you can imagine how that makes me feel.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.630
I apologise.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.670
That's fine. Don't do it again.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.560
No, stay.

12:40.320 --> 12:45.030
In my defence, as a mother
I have to be ring master

12:45.080 --> 12:47.840
- and lion tamer and...
- Knife thrower?

12:49.080 --> 12:51.230
Beautiful trapeze artist?

12:51.280 --> 12:54.960
Thank you, Leslie. I was going
to say tight-rope walker.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.030
And I got the balance wrong

12:58.080 --> 13:01.910
between allowing each of you to
be yourselves and supervising you.

13:01.960 --> 13:06.350
Can I say I don't think the
lion should be made to do tricks?

13:06.400 --> 13:09.310
Say nothing. You need teaching.
You still don't even know

13:09.360 --> 13:13.030
- what 7 x 8 is. - (54.) - 54.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.000
It's 56.

13:17.400 --> 13:21.470
Ah, Lugaretzia, you are Gerry's policeman.

13:21.520 --> 13:26.120
- Make sure he doesn't leave the house.
- At last -- power.

13:26.760 --> 13:30.590
Please understand, I'm just
trying to generate enough income

13:30.640 --> 13:33.950
to keep us in this house
and to stay sane by,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.560
well, by enjoying my life, too.

13:38.040 --> 13:42.910
Oh, and, er, let's all read Larry's book.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.390
- Oh...
- And really enjoy it.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.120
Here.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.920
Not you. Too rude.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.640
Hm?

14:08.080 --> 14:13.190
I don't always want to speak to
you, because you give the impression

14:13.240 --> 14:17.390
- I'm very much not as clever as you.
- Well, you're not. Thank God.

14:17.440 --> 14:21.350
Because I don't want clever
from you, I want... support...

14:21.400 --> 14:25.320
- and attachment.
- And food?

14:26.240 --> 14:28.270
Yes, and food.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.430
And praise, and freedom, and security.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.670
That's what being a parent is, isn't it?

14:34.720 --> 14:38.240
A promise to make everything
all right. That's the deal.

14:39.080 --> 14:42.510
If you're as clever as you
think you are, you'd understand

14:42.560 --> 14:46.310
a deal requires the effort and
commitment of both parties.

14:46.360 --> 14:49.280
Hm? Yours, perhaps?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.920
Ignore me, I'm being an idiot.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.990
I'm just disappointed.

15:05.040 --> 15:08.790
I know you are. You spent a lot
of time and love on that book.

15:08.840 --> 15:13.400
That's why I feel a fraud.
Much ado from me about nothing.

15:14.760 --> 15:18.350
This book is the first step

15:18.400 --> 15:20.750
on a dazzling career,

15:20.800 --> 15:24.590
and the real reason that I
find it difficult to read is...

15:24.640 --> 15:28.550
Well, you're my son, so the
sex makes me feel queasy.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.870
- Oh, that's ridiculous. - How would you
feel if I wrote intimate love scenes?

15:32.920 --> 15:35.240
- Absolutely fine.
- Be honest.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.880
- A little icky.
- Hm.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.670
But happily,

15:42.720 --> 15:46.440
I have had that marvellous
idea about your writing career.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.720
Mrs Durrell. How lovely. Come in.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.400
Excuse the jars of local pond life.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.350
Oh, well, er, I won't keep you.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.430
Um, just two things.

16:10.480 --> 16:14.510
- Theo, would you please be
Gerry's tutor? - No. - Oh.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.310
Well, why not? He loves you.

16:17.360 --> 16:21.670
I'd rather be his friend. I
mentioned hygiene -- he growled.

16:21.720 --> 16:25.470
Oh, I'm sorry. I think he literally
wants to turn into an animal.

16:25.520 --> 16:28.440
No, he's right. I'm not his parent.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.070
I'm letting them all down.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.630
I've been thinking about Larry.

16:35.680 --> 16:40.270
Yes, he seemed downcast.
I've experienced this myself.

16:40.320 --> 16:44.150
- Fireworks only go off in
the author's head. - Exactly.

16:44.200 --> 16:47.910
So I've decided... Could we
arrange an event, or something,

16:47.960 --> 16:51.080
- where we have readings from it?
- Of course.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.520
Greece is the cradle of
literature. I'll organise it.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.510
Why would anyone want to watch
a bloke read out a book?

17:04.560 --> 17:09.310
To hear it, meet the fascinating
author, ask questions.

17:09.359 --> 17:13.030
Hello. What sort of typewriter do you use?

17:13.079 --> 17:16.869
Leslie, why don't you go
home and pick some beans?

17:16.920 --> 17:20.480
- No, I'm busy labelling our liqueur.
- All right, darling.

17:26.319 --> 17:30.830
Ah. Our genial landlady.
What can I do for you?

17:30.880 --> 17:33.630
He wants you now, but it'll not last.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.990
- You're talking about Hugh?
- I understand men.

17:37.040 --> 17:41.470
Ah, well, do put it in a book so all
us girls can share your knowledge.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.840
I'm more pretty, and young.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.000
And now you're making me cross.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.160
You know, I wasn't sure about Hugh,

17:52.760 --> 17:55.800
but now I think I might give him a go.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.030
Luga, has Georgios the postman been?

18:09.080 --> 18:11.430
- Been where?
- Here.

18:11.480 --> 18:15.310
Why you want letters? They bring bad news.

18:15.360 --> 18:19.110
I was hoping for congratulations
on my book via a cheery telegram

18:19.160 --> 18:23.310
or a laudatory haiku from
fellow writers. Deluded.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.590
Leslie. The best.

18:25.640 --> 18:29.160
- Larry, 11am business meeting.
- Oh, yes.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.510
Item number one -- sales campaign.

18:36.560 --> 18:40.590
I think we need to go round bars
and shops, drumming up our orders.

18:40.640 --> 18:44.630
- No, I think you should do that.
- Oh, um, well, it's just

18:44.680 --> 18:48.350
- I'm making the actual liqueur.
- And you're doing a fabulous job.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.750
Thank you. So what are YOU going to do?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.440
Planning.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.360
- Er, planning what?
- Planning... a strategy.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.430
- Strategy in terms of?
- Well, exactly.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.800
Where do you start? That's
what I'll be planning.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.240
Maybe you should pick more kumquats?

19:12.160 --> 19:14.390
Yeah, erm...

19:16.920 --> 19:20.550
- Hello, Theo. - What do I have
to do to get a drink around here?

19:20.600 --> 19:23.350
Oh. Pay ten drachma.

19:23.400 --> 19:27.350
- I'll put you down for one crate. Theo.
- No, I barely drink.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.990
Like the English, I
cherish my inhibitions.

19:31.040 --> 19:34.830
You have spelled 'liqueur'
with just too many Es.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.870
Larry, your mother and I agree
your novel deserves more attention.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.830
Oh, er, yes, I've read lots
of your book now and it's...

19:46.880 --> 19:49.070
well, really quite something.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.190
Thank you, Les.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.480
Who's your favourite character?

19:56.400 --> 19:58.470
The man.

19:58.520 --> 20:02.430
So your mother and I have
arranged a public event next Monday

20:02.480 --> 20:04.830
where you can read your novel.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.320
Theo, that's so exciting.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.470
- I'll start preparing some passages.
- You could try and get some orders

20:13.520 --> 20:15.760
while you're out and about.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.510
Florence, we're having a reading of
my book and you're my first invitee.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.070
Are we dim, or is this
really difficult to read?

20:26.120 --> 20:28.670
Would I miss the literary
event of the year?

20:28.720 --> 20:32.600
In fact, the only literary event, unless
you count most people's tax returns?

20:33.840 --> 20:38.190
Poetic, isn't it? Poetry
always spoils everything.

20:38.240 --> 20:41.720
... that was sprawled across the ocean.

20:42.960 --> 20:46.470
My son Lawrence is having
a reading of his novel.

20:46.520 --> 20:50.390
I'll be reading in English, but the
language is musical, symphonic,

20:50.440 --> 20:53.950
- so you'll, erm...
- These are heavenly.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.110
- Try one. - 'Briskly she sucked in
her underlip and screwed up her eyes.'

20:58.160 --> 21:02.510
- Mmm. - Hello. This is my new book.
Pied Piper Of Lovers. It's brilliant.

21:02.560 --> 21:06.750
- I'll be reading at 5pm on...
- Can you help with this liqueur?

21:06.800 --> 21:08.350
No, I'm busy preparing.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.560
'The flesh, the peeled flesh.'

21:13.000 --> 21:15.070
Oh, God, I hope it goes well.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.630
Larry's pretty resilient, isn't he?

21:17.680 --> 21:19.790
No. No, it's all an act.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.600
It was my idea. I need it
to work or he'll hate me.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.880
- Is it tasty yet?
- No, it's not quite ready.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.110
Ah...

21:43.160 --> 21:45.830
- Harsh but promising.
- Mm.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.270
What about me?

21:48.320 --> 21:50.550
- Sip it.
- Yeah, sip it.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.070
You didn't sip it.

21:53.120 --> 21:56.360
You know I'm on the lookout
for prejudice against women?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.670
- Nice. - Spiro, come
and look at my otters.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.590
- I'm playing them the guitar.
- Why?

22:17.640 --> 22:20.880
Because Mummy said Hugh played her music.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.950
But I don't think it's working.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.600
Perhaps they prefer the bouzouki?

22:31.880 --> 22:34.870
Ah. Spiro. How delightful.

22:34.920 --> 22:39.390
- Mrs Durrells. - Can you help?
I've been trying for a week

22:39.440 --> 22:43.670
- to find Gerry a tutor.
- I don't need one. 7 x 8 is 56.

22:43.720 --> 22:46.310
- And what is 9 x 6?
- (54.)

22:46.360 --> 22:48.350
I'm not falling for that again.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.710
Gerry, knowledge is like a firefly --

22:50.760 --> 22:54.230
beautiful in itself and bringer
of light into the darkness.

22:54.280 --> 22:57.600
Spiro, would you be Gerry's tutor?

22:58.320 --> 23:00.790
He looks up to you and you
obviously know your maths.

23:00.840 --> 23:04.190
- Oh, is that right?
- I'd be very happy.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.630
- I believe in discipline.
- That won't work, then.

23:06.680 --> 23:10.550
- Excellent. - Combined with intervals
for joking. - Good. - Perfect.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.600
- When can you start?
- Now.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.600
See? Not such a bad mother after all.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.870
Spell Mediterranean.

23:20.920 --> 23:25.670
- M-E... - Mm-hm. - D-D...

23:25.720 --> 23:28.190
No! Wrong. Terrible!

23:28.240 --> 23:30.870
My teacher would've
locked me in the cupboard!

23:30.920 --> 23:33.080
This is going to take a long time.

23:39.080 --> 23:43.390
The difference between us
superior Greeks and the Turks...

23:43.440 --> 23:47.470
- We did this yesterday.
- And we will do it again tomorrow.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.750
The difference --

23:49.800 --> 23:53.870
Turkey is named after a big ugly bird

23:53.920 --> 23:56.030
who tastes boring.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.910
- May I feed my pelicans?
- No. Concentrate.

23:58.960 --> 24:02.430
You don't look at otters
or stroke pelicans.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.750
You learn as I did at school

24:04.800 --> 24:07.230
and as Mrs Durrell's requested.

24:09.320 --> 24:12.440
Oh, my God. Gerry, you're crying.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.510
No, no.

24:15.560 --> 24:20.110
Is it because your otters
are not making love?

24:20.160 --> 24:23.520
- Excuse my language.
- No, it's your teaching.

24:24.600 --> 24:28.720
- Oh. - You're reminding me a little
of my school masters back in England.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.150
I wasn't happy.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.840
Oh.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.360
I am sorry.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.800
Half an hour to go. Relax, Larry.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.510
What if nobody turns up?

24:51.560 --> 24:55.440
We Greeks love literature and
you've all invited friends.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.760
Go outside and drag people in.

25:13.520 --> 25:16.950
Darling, go and talk to
him. He's tired of me.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.800
- Who's he?
- He's our audience.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.440
Greetings.

25:27.920 --> 25:33.510
Either I have come on the wrong day
or the room needs to be smaller,

25:33.560 --> 25:36.190
- as in Alice In Wonderland.
- Yes.

25:36.240 --> 25:40.200
Yes, it's a bit of a wash-out, isn't
it? We'll laugh about it someday.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.000
Maybe not for a while, though.

25:45.720 --> 25:49.720
Do buy some of the kumquat liqueur,
it's got a very distinctive tang.

25:52.640 --> 25:56.670
Darling. Darling, I'm sure
they love your book in Britain.

25:56.720 --> 26:00.750
After all, we never went to a Greek
book-reading in Bournemouth, did we?

26:00.800 --> 26:02.520
Oh...

26:09.760 --> 26:10.910
Um, thank you...

26:11.360 --> 26:14.270
He's a very good author. Sit down here.

26:14.320 --> 26:17.950
- He says he'll stay if
there's free food. - Shhh.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.790
Thank you for coming, both of you.

26:20.840 --> 26:24.430
In view of the sparseness of the turnout,

26:24.480 --> 26:27.440
let's just call it all off.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.710
In case I never have
another book published,

26:32.760 --> 26:36.230
perhaps I could just say
thanks for reminding me

26:36.280 --> 26:39.110
that art and writing is
like lying down in the road

26:39.160 --> 26:42.350
and asking people to stop and look at you,

26:42.400 --> 26:44.480
and today,

26:45.560 --> 26:47.560
I got run over.

26:57.160 --> 26:59.150
Where's Florence?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.990
And Hugh?

27:01.040 --> 27:03.390
Why don't people care?

27:03.440 --> 27:05.510
They don't have to enjoy it.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.230
Hm?

27:07.280 --> 27:09.000
Ochi, ochi.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.070
Larry!

27:25.120 --> 27:29.030
I've been to the post office.
It was strange you had no mail.

27:29.080 --> 27:34.000
It seems the postman was too
scared of Gerry's animals to visit.

27:35.280 --> 27:39.350
'Bravo on your nov. Everyone talking
about your new way with language.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.480
I'm very drunk, by the way.'

27:43.440 --> 27:46.390
'Reviews top notch. Wish you were here.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.990
Well, not here as I
find myself in prison.'

27:49.040 --> 27:51.710
Bloody hell. 'You clever bugger.'

27:51.760 --> 27:53.710
- I told you it was good!
- I knew it was good.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.910
I was worried it was too good
for people to understand.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.830
Now I can work on my new novel,
which will be better than the last.

27:59.880 --> 28:06.000
- More animals? - Villains with horrible
plans? - No. - Am I in it? - No. - Me? - No.

28:07.840 --> 28:10.440
Well, erm, drinks to celebrate?

28:12.440 --> 28:14.800
Hugh? Hugh!

28:16.800 --> 28:18.800
- Oh.
- Hello.

28:19.800 --> 28:24.030
So you couldn't bother to turn
up to my son's book reading? Why?

28:24.080 --> 28:27.030
Sorry, I didn't realise
it was so important.

28:27.080 --> 28:30.480
Well, it would've been
decent of you. No-one came.

28:34.440 --> 28:37.070
Is it too late to change my excuse

28:37.120 --> 28:40.470
to there was an accident
at my olive press?

28:40.520 --> 28:42.600
Many dead, olives everywhere?

28:45.280 --> 28:47.710
I... I know it's selfish, but...

28:47.760 --> 28:51.030
I like it best when
it's just the two of us.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.870
Well, I come in a bundle with my family.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.750
Their needs are my needs.

28:56.800 --> 29:00.720
To be honest, I thought Sven would
be there. I was being thoughtful.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.510
Well, how were you to know?

29:03.560 --> 29:06.950
It was important to Larry,
so it's important to me.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.280
Larry's shell is thinner than you think.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.480
- Yia mas! - To Larry! - To me!

29:15.880 --> 29:18.510
Luga, we're toasting my book.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.790
Toast it. Good idea.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.070
No, toasting as in drinking to it

29:23.120 --> 29:25.360
and to you and to Corfu. Go on.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.750
- I think I'm disappointing
Pavlos, my monk. - No.

29:30.800 --> 29:34.750
You may not be a good nun yet,
but he knows you're a good person.

29:34.800 --> 29:38.510
I think we're all good people, don't you?

29:38.560 --> 29:41.720
Even bad people are good people.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.600
This alcohol is making me so wise.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.160
Gerry! Come and see!

29:53.920 --> 29:56.070
Hey!

29:56.120 --> 29:58.230

- Hello, Spiro.

Ta-da!

30:07.280 --> 30:09.310
Spiro, thank you!

- Magpies!
- Yes, magenpies.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.830
- Magpies.
- Magenpies. Like I say.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.110
Mag-pies.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.450
Mag-en-pies.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.510
Watch out they don't steal anything.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.830
Awful thieves, magenpies.

30:24.880 --> 30:28.750
- Kumquat liqueur, Spiro?
- No, thank you, my family are waiting for me.

30:28.800 --> 30:32.040
- OK, just a small one.

I've never tried this before,
but I'm going to walk on water.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.670
Argh!

32:45.760 --> 32:53.120
~

32:59.880 --> 33:03.560
I am too grown up to say I told you so.

33:05.360 --> 33:08.950
Ah, Theo. Can I get you
an early-morning snifter?

33:09.000 --> 33:09.690
No!

33:11.240 --> 33:13.270
You think you're so funny, don't you?

33:13.320 --> 33:18.110
I'm only catching up with you. You
all thought you were hilarious.

33:18.660 --> 33:20.750
And darling Margo,

33:20.800 --> 33:25.990
I suggested to Pavlos you might not
be quite ready to take the veil.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.830
Thank you.

33:27.880 --> 33:31.430
I think I like boys too
much to be a top-notch nun.

33:31.480 --> 33:35.480
Yes, I think you made that clear
by inviting him for a naked swim.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.700
Morning, Theo.

33:41.840 --> 33:46.190
On a brighter note, I've
mended the magenpies' cage.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.950
I will never forgive you.
Those birds ransacked my room!

33:50.000 --> 33:51.950
Half of my manuscript's in the Ionian Sea.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.750
Then you should've kept it
in a bird-proof receptacle.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.830
No. I hate this house and its stupid
restrictions and thieving wildlife.

33:58.880 --> 34:02.110
Is it any wonder I'm
finding it so hard to write?

34:02.160 --> 34:05.830
- You'll blame anyone but yourself.
- What other serious writers

34:05.880 --> 34:09.150
- live with their parents? - Jane
Austen. - One of my favourites.

34:09.199 --> 34:12.270
- Exquisite prose.
- The book reading went wrong.

34:12.320 --> 34:15.630
I shouldn't have my mother
trying to arrange my life.

34:15.679 --> 34:19.110
- It's the hangover, he's not
of sound mind. - Oh, I am.

34:19.159 --> 34:21.840
I'm getting a place of my own.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.600
Well, go on, then.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.239
Leave.

34:42.820 --> 34:47.400
~

34:47.699 --> 34:51.380
It must be good, because I
don't understand a word of it.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.570
I can't believe Larry's really going.

34:55.620 --> 34:57.940
I know, to live above a bar.

34:59.460 --> 35:02.260
- Hello, Margo. Louisa.
- Hello.

35:04.180 --> 35:05.770
Ooh. Those crumpets looks nice.

35:05.820 --> 35:09.370
Listen to me, I could
be back in Harrogate.

35:09.420 --> 35:13.100
You could've had some for
free at Larry's book launch.

35:14.100 --> 35:16.970
- Sorry I couldn't make it.
- No.

35:17.020 --> 35:20.650
Well, that's Corfu for you,
isn't it? So much to do.

35:20.700 --> 35:24.700
Cinemas, theatres, other book launches.

35:30.980 --> 35:33.330
You can be quite fierce, can't you?

35:33.380 --> 35:35.490
Oh, I don't know.

35:35.540 --> 35:37.890
Oh, it's probably guilt.

35:37.940 --> 35:40.930
I... I didn't support Larry so...

35:40.980 --> 35:43.340
now I'm taking it out on others.

35:48.380 --> 35:51.770
Remember to set the float
at the correct height

35:51.820 --> 35:54.690
and do not tighten the nuts too hard.

35:54.740 --> 35:57.330
This is how you fix a carburettor.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.570
Enough car maintenance. Now philosophy.

36:00.620 --> 36:02.610
My philosophy

36:02.660 --> 36:04.930
is that ladies

36:04.980 --> 36:07.250
are goddesses.

36:07.300 --> 36:09.130
Except Turkish ladies.

36:09.180 --> 36:14.090
American ladies are too
noisy but they can't help it.

36:14.140 --> 36:17.730
Spiro, thank you for your
help, but you can stop now.

36:17.780 --> 36:20.690
- I'm less strict now, huh?
- Let's just say

36:20.740 --> 36:24.340
it's not quite the
education I had in mind.

36:36.140 --> 36:37.860
Mum!

36:38.860 --> 36:40.420
Mum!

36:43.420 --> 36:45.530
What is it, Gerry?

36:45.580 --> 36:48.530
- What... - Shhh! - What
are we watching, Gerry?

36:48.580 --> 36:51.530
They're finally going to mate.

36:51.580 --> 36:54.130
No idea what put them in the mood.

36:54.180 --> 36:56.980
Otters? Women? Who knows?

36:57.860 --> 37:00.260
Men are always in the mood.

37:11.580 --> 37:15.250
Right, well, you know where
I am. Above Costa's bar.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.140
- I'll be on my way.
- You don't have to go.

37:19.020 --> 37:21.930
We could start a new
business -- shoe-shining.

37:21.980 --> 37:25.530
We could buy some brushes
and find a pitch in town.

37:25.580 --> 37:28.540
- Not really.
- No, no, of course not. Erm...

37:36.980 --> 37:41.290
- I'm going to finish your book
if it kills me. - Thank you.

37:41.340 --> 37:45.860
- Praise indeed. - Larry, we've
had our disagreements, but...

37:47.860 --> 37:51.450
- can I use your room as an
overspill area for my animals? - No.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.500
- Thank you.
- I said no.

37:58.780 --> 38:00.620
Please stay.

38:01.700 --> 38:04.020
Listen to Mrs Durrells, Larry.

38:05.460 --> 38:07.740
Stop it, I've got to do this.

38:13.780 --> 38:17.890
You are a good mother. If
anything, I'm too happy here.

38:17.940 --> 38:21.330
The best writers I know are
living life in the raw.

38:21.380 --> 38:25.650
One's in jail. I've never
even been in a fight,

38:25.700 --> 38:29.330
- so how can I write about that?
- Well, you could make it up.

38:29.380 --> 38:33.900
- Jane Austen was never in a fight.
- I heard she always got into scuffles.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.810
I'm halfway through your book.

38:38.860 --> 38:41.820
I'd rather you weren't quite so smutty.

38:43.060 --> 38:44.890
It's dazzling.

38:44.940 --> 38:47.020
I'm very proud of you.

38:48.580 --> 38:52.530
It's going to be like being
a widow all over again.

38:52.580 --> 38:56.300
I'll wait for you to say
something and you won't be there.

39:26.780 --> 39:30.130
So this is just as good as your stuff

39:30.180 --> 39:33.610
and I can give you it at
a very reasonable price,

39:33.660 --> 39:35.930
as my business partner and I are...

39:35.980 --> 39:38.300
We're moving out of alcohol sales.

39:41.540 --> 39:43.540
Elate, paidia.

39:44.300 --> 39:47.540
- Sas efcharisto. Poli
efgeniko ek merous sas. - Yeah.

39:55.420 --> 39:58.140
No, no, no, I thought
you could pay me for it.

40:19.220 --> 40:21.340
There you are.

40:22.140 --> 40:25.850
I know drink isn't the answer,
but you look like you need one.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.220
What's the matter?

40:35.340 --> 40:37.420
My son Larry...

40:39.180 --> 40:41.170
left home.

40:41.220 --> 40:45.210
He's still your child and
he's going to find out

40:45.260 --> 40:47.300
that he needs you more than ever.

40:53.740 --> 40:55.740
Climb aboard.

40:57.700 --> 40:59.690
I'm not going to your house.

40:59.740 --> 41:02.970
Too many gypsy fiddlers
lurking in corners.

41:03.020 --> 41:05.330
No, I can do better than that.

41:05.380 --> 41:10.380
♪ Now I can give you anything but love

41:11.420 --> 41:13.580
♪ Oh, baby...

41:15.620 --> 41:19.170
- How do you like your steak?
- Cooked by anyone other than me.

41:19.220 --> 41:21.810
Ah, yes, the burdens of parenthood.

41:21.860 --> 41:24.010
Oh, you have no idea.

41:24.060 --> 41:26.910
And if I have any more
of these, neither will I.

41:28.660 --> 41:31.730
Well, consciousness is overrated.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.530
I would help but it's my night off.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.300
Ah...

41:39.420 --> 41:42.410
Thank you for this.

41:42.460 --> 41:47.100
I've arranged for a shooting
star to cross the sky about...

41:47.900 --> 41:49.740
now.

41:56.340 --> 41:58.540
It'll be along in a minute.

42:16.020 --> 42:19.660
I'm too grown up to say I told you so.

42:20.420 --> 42:23.850
Can I get you an early-morning snifter?

42:23.900 --> 42:25.890
Oh, shut up.

42:25.940 --> 42:28.580
Though I think you might need this.

42:32.340 --> 42:33.280
Oh!

42:35.060 --> 42:38.410
So I have examined the
patient, a female otter.

42:38.460 --> 42:42.410
I can't say it was easy and I
haven't a clue if she's pregnant.

42:42.460 --> 42:46.610
I think she is. She's been slobbing
around a lot, seems very moody.

42:46.660 --> 42:50.490
I suspect they've been mating
every time our back is turned.

42:50.540 --> 42:54.420
That's what I'd do if I was
stuck in a cage with a bloke.

42:55.060 --> 42:57.130
- Good day, everyone!
- Oh.

42:57.180 --> 43:02.650
- Good morning.
- So, mon petit, you must be my victim.

43:02.700 --> 43:06.090
Mr Kralefsky has agreed
to be your new tutor.

43:06.140 --> 43:09.090
I have brought you some reading matter

43:09.140 --> 43:12.260
to romp through before...

43:13.340 --> 43:15.380
we meet.

43:16.380 --> 43:19.330
Oh. Isn't it exciting?

43:19.380 --> 43:21.220
Hm.

43:25.980 --> 43:27.620
Oh.

43:33.020 --> 43:34.850
Oh, Florence.

43:34.900 --> 43:37.290
Oh, you don't look well.

43:37.340 --> 43:41.260
- I was going to say the same to you.
- Hung over. She drink too much.

43:43.340 --> 43:46.930
- I want to explain why I wasn't
at Larry's book reading. - It's OK.

43:46.980 --> 43:49.260
I was at home being sick.

43:49.940 --> 43:52.010
I'm having a baby, all being well.

43:52.060 --> 43:54.570
Oh, Florence.

43:54.620 --> 43:57.410
I've been sick for weeks but
didn't want to say till I was sure.

43:57.460 --> 44:02.490
- Of course. - My daughter also
pregnant. - Lugaretzia, congratulations.

44:02.540 --> 44:05.140
That is why now she's like a witch.

44:05.780 --> 44:07.780
Oh, excuse me.

44:13.260 --> 44:17.450
- Has Florence been drinking?
- No. - She's having a baby.

44:17.500 --> 44:20.370
The joys of motherhood.

44:20.420 --> 44:24.450
Some species of shark have a
gestation period of 3½ years,

44:24.500 --> 44:26.970
- so you're getting off lightly. - Hm.

44:27.020 --> 44:30.940
- So you're not the only one
with things on her mind. - No.

44:36.900 --> 44:38.900
Why is it so quiet?

44:39.980 --> 44:43.060
Because Larry isn't living here any more.

45:18.060 --> 45:23.120
~

45:26.820 --> 45:28.540
Hello.

45:31.300 --> 45:33.300
Buy me a drink.

45:41.660 --> 45:45.330
- We'll give you a fabulous birthday.
- What could this be? - A fossil.

45:45.380 --> 45:49.090
- How old do you all think I am?
- 50? - That sounds about right.

45:49.140 --> 45:53.130
- Don't tell Mother, Vasilia came to see me.
- I like your mother.

45:53.180 --> 45:56.970
- I want to understand her a bit better.
- I'm living for the moment.

45:57.020 --> 45:59.930
Theo's lent me a camera to take portraits.

45:59.980 --> 46:03.820
I am young and I am fun and
I will not let you forget it!
