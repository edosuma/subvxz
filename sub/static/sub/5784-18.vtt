WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:05.437
(theme music)

00:45.178 --> 00:48.747
(lively hubbub)

00:48.749 --> 00:52.684
(piano music)

00:58.458 --> 01:01.093
(applause)

01:14.374 --> 01:18.243
A little token of my affection
for my favourite Mr. Wednesday.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.746
(new music starting)
That's my cue!

01:20.748 --> 01:23.348
Enjoy the routine and
don't run off after.

01:26.619 --> 01:29.388
(cheering, hooting
and whistling)

01:42.869 --> 01:45.771
(exaggerated gasping
and sighing)

01:49.642 --> 01:52.744
(whistling)

01:55.115 --> 01:57.382
(hooting)

02:02.155 --> 02:05.524
(ratchety sound of arming)

02:05.526 --> 02:07.392
(cheering)

02:12.465 --> 02:14.967
(gunshot)

02:16.903 --> 02:19.571
(whistling)

02:25.011 --> 02:26.979
The infamous
Star Room.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.848
Not one of our city's
finer forms of entertainment.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.884
A good burlesque can be
just as entertaining

02:31.886 --> 02:35.120
as a good vaudeville.
If a little suggestive.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.556
Well, this place
attracts all sorts.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.625
Good evening, Doctor.
Inspector.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.627
I'm sorry for dragging you
to such a place at this time

02:41.629 --> 02:44.029
of night.
Not at all. I've always

02:44.031 --> 02:46.265
wondered what
it looked like inside.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.301
Not an entirely unlikely
venue in which to find a murder.

02:49.303 --> 02:52.137
More unexpected that anyone
bothered to tell us about it.

02:52.139 --> 02:55.607
Henry. Who telephoned
the police?

02:55.609 --> 02:57.543
Well, sir...

02:57.545 --> 02:59.444
I did.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.446
George?
Crabtree!

03:01.448 --> 03:03.415
What the bloody hell are you
doing in a place like this?

03:03.417 --> 03:07.085
Sir...
(the inspector): Higgins.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.459
(conversations)

03:17.564 --> 03:19.565
All right. What did you see?

03:19.567 --> 03:22.868
A couple of pretty girls.
A couple of not so pretty ones.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.170
It's alright Crabtree.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.472
I've been found in
worse places than this.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.408
What can you tell us
about the incident, George?

03:29.410 --> 03:31.643
Sirs, I can't tell you
much of anything.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.879
Where were you seated?
Here at this table.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.081
How could you not
see anything?

03:36.083 --> 03:38.150
You were sitting
almost on top of the crime!

03:38.152 --> 03:40.352
Well, Sir, I don't know;
it gets loud in here.

03:40.354 --> 03:43.322
Well, this may help
explain a few things.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.124
He used a kitchen
towel to muffle the gun.

03:46.126 --> 03:49.628
So, he walks in, wraps
the gun in a kitchen towel,

03:49.630 --> 03:52.331
shoots the victim,
and walks out.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.634
And the victim's
dead a few minutes
before anyone's even noticed.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.570
Giving the killer
ample time to escape.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.173
Anything, Julia?

04:01.175 --> 04:04.243
Yes. A single gunshot
wound to the right temple.

04:04.245 --> 04:07.346
I'll conduct a full post-mortem
but I can't imagine the cause

04:07.348 --> 04:10.582
of death will change.
Is it your day off, George?

04:10.584 --> 04:13.585
Doctor, yes.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.622
I'm sorry that the show
was so rudely interrupted.

04:16.624 --> 04:19.625
They say it's quite a spectacle.
Actually, doctor,

04:19.627 --> 04:22.828
it really is-Well...
Well.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.264
(both, together): Yes.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.332
(sighing): I believe my work
here is done. Gentlemen.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.701
Thank you, Julia.

04:29.703 --> 04:34.439
George... exactly what was
happening here an hour ago?

04:34.441 --> 04:38.243
Sir, I believe that's when
Miss Nina Bloom was on stage.

04:38.245 --> 04:41.346
Which would explain why
no one noticed this. She's...

04:41.348 --> 04:43.882
She's rather the reason
why men come here.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.285
You say that as though you've
been here more than once.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.489
Let's get started,
shall we?

04:50.491 --> 04:52.791
What would you like me to do?
Go home, Crabtree.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.527
This is still
your day off.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.030
Full of surprises, that one.

04:58.032 --> 05:00.032
Hm.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.301
Ah, you there...

05:02.303 --> 05:05.504
You found the body, did you?
Yes, I did.

05:05.506 --> 05:09.007
I heard this was a rough
place, but I didn't expect this.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.376
And what were you doing
prior to finding the body?

05:11.378 --> 05:13.779
I was around the tables,
picking up glasses.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.148
And you didn't see anything?
Nothing.

05:16.150 --> 05:19.051
Right. Thank you.
This place is full

05:19.053 --> 05:20.819
of lowlifes.
Could have been any of them.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.888
And you're certain that you
didn't see anyone take a towel

05:22.890 --> 05:25.057
off the bar?
I'm here alone.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.426
You see how crowded it is.
It hardly matters to me

05:27.428 --> 05:30.262
what happens to the towels.
Can you identify the victim?

05:30.264 --> 05:32.898
Called himself Gerry.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.434
A regular?
Last couple of months.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.869
Always sat at the same table.
Never caused any trouble.

05:37.871 --> 05:41.073
Had a bit of an eye for Lydia.
Who?

05:41.075 --> 05:44.743
Miss Lydia Hall.
The redhead.

05:46.779 --> 05:50.449
We didn't see anything. We
were both busy on the stage.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.785
You didn't hear anything
resembling a gunshot?

05:53.787 --> 05:56.855
We already told you: no.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.191
I understand

05:59.193 --> 06:01.360
you were familiar with
the victim, Miss Hall?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.163
No. Not really.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.268
If you withhold
the truth from me,

06:10.270 --> 06:13.038
I will be forced to add you
to my list of suspects.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.074
Now, the truth, please.

06:20.346 --> 06:24.383
His name was Gerry. He had
a room on Sumach Street.

06:24.385 --> 06:27.719
The corner of
Sumach and King.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.322
Thank you.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.528
There it is!

06:38.698 --> 06:41.700
Julia. I am concerned
about George

06:41.702 --> 06:44.536
frequenting a place
like that on his own.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.072
Perhaps he doesn't wish

06:47.074 --> 06:49.741
to spend his free time
alone in his room.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.244
Well, the vaudeville, yes.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.347
The arcade, even.
But the Star Room?

06:55.349 --> 06:58.784
It just doesn't seem like the
sort of place he would visit.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.620
George has had
a difficult year, William.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.189
First Edna,
then Emily leaving.

07:04.191 --> 07:07.359
Perhaps he's simply lonely.
Hm...

07:09.128 --> 07:11.763
At any rate, 22 caliber.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.267
I'm afraid there's likely not
much else the body can tell us.

07:15.269 --> 07:19.104
Right. Thank you, Julia.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.740
I think
what George needs

07:21.742 --> 07:25.177
is a friend.
Someone he can talk to.

07:25.179 --> 07:28.480
Oh, would you--
Not me, William...

07:28.482 --> 07:30.382
You!

07:30.384 --> 07:34.085
Right. Right.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.090
Ah, here we are, Sir.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.092
Awfully callous of the landlord
to throw out the victim's

07:41.094 --> 07:43.495
belongings so soon.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.198
In any case, this must be
the crate he was talking about.

07:53.072 --> 07:55.440
George, I thought
that you and I

07:55.442 --> 07:57.976
might spend
an evening together,

07:57.978 --> 08:00.178
um, outside of work.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.347
Sir, I would
enjoy that very much.

08:02.349 --> 08:05.150
Well, I thought
you might be amenable

08:05.152 --> 08:07.152
to an evening
at Vaudeville.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.654
Sir, to tell you the truth
I've gone off vaudeville

08:09.656 --> 08:12.657
a bit. It's
too competitive.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.060
All right then,
if not vaudeville,

08:15.062 --> 08:18.063
perhaps, uh... a concert,

08:18.065 --> 08:21.433
or... a lecture!

08:21.435 --> 08:24.836
Yes. The Royal Society

08:24.838 --> 08:27.439
of Geologists is hosting
an evening of talks

08:27.441 --> 08:31.109
about tectonics,
that's the division of--

08:33.513 --> 08:36.982
Perhaps you could choose
an activity, George.

08:36.984 --> 08:41.119
Sir, I don't suppose you'd be
up for a night at the burlesque?

08:41.121 --> 08:43.321
I know what you're thinking,
sir; some of the themes

08:43.323 --> 08:45.824
are adult in nature, but it's
actually a very clever show,

08:45.826 --> 08:48.193
sir. People often
say one thing

08:48.195 --> 08:51.263
when they sort of mean
something else. Very cheeky.

08:51.265 --> 08:54.900
Yes, I'm familiar with what
burlesque entails, George.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.836
I just... didn't
figure that to be

08:57.838 --> 09:00.939
your sort
of... comedy.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.874
Well, sir, to tell you
the truth, it's one

09:02.876 --> 09:05.810
of the dancers there.
Miss Nina Bloom. She's--

09:05.812 --> 09:08.613
It sounds silly, sir,
but she is mesmerizing.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.416
That's her job, George.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.552
Yes, I realize
that, sir, but...

09:13.554 --> 09:16.721
it's hard to explain.
Have you a relationship

09:16.723 --> 09:19.658
with this...
Oh, heavens no, sir.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.928
I doubt she knows me from Adam.
I see.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.463
You really need to see her
perform to understand, I think.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.701
Yes, well perhaps
we'll find an activity

09:29.703 --> 09:32.170
that we could
both enjoy, huh?

09:32.172 --> 09:34.439
Ah, here we are.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.808
A birth certificate.
From Buffalo.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.945
The victim's full name
was Gerald Sloan.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.748
Well, here you are, George.
Find out everything you can

09:43.750 --> 09:46.918
about Mr. Sloan from his
neighbours, his employer,

09:46.920 --> 09:49.487
and I think you'll
find the dancer,

09:49.489 --> 09:51.823
Miss Lydia Hall,
has some insights.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.326
Sir.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.962
All right, George.

09:56.964 --> 10:00.532
It's good,
talking, like this.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.601
It's quite good.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.242
(hubbub)

10:27.560 --> 10:30.061
Hello, Mr. Wednesday!

10:30.063 --> 10:32.564
You do know the show
doesn't start until later.

10:32.566 --> 10:35.166
Or are you hoping
for a sneak peek?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.369
Eh, no. That is--
I don't believe

10:37.371 --> 10:40.572
I caught your name.
George Crabtree.

10:40.574 --> 10:43.041
Nina Bloom.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.176
At your service, Constable.

10:45.178 --> 10:48.980
I'm actually here on...
official business, Miss Bloom.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.683
And here I thought you'd come
to help me with my routine.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.986
Give me a few pointers
from a real copper.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.622
Perhaps I'm holding
my gun incorrectly.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.191
You are, in fact,

11:00.193 --> 11:02.394
but I hardly think
anybody minds.

11:02.396 --> 11:06.598
Oh no. This is my craft.
I strive for realism.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.801
In fact, I'm
having some trouble

11:09.803 --> 11:12.237
taming my billy club.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.272
Maybe you can show me
your technique?

11:14.274 --> 11:16.841
I am here to
investigate a murder.

11:16.843 --> 11:20.045
Lucky me!

11:20.047 --> 11:22.947
You don't act like most people
do when the police show up.

11:22.949 --> 11:25.350
(soft laugh from her)

11:25.352 --> 11:27.519
Especially --
In a place like this?

11:27.521 --> 11:30.622
(laughing): Well,
I'm not most people.

11:30.624 --> 11:34.125
And if you haven't noticed, I've
taken a bit of a shine to you.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.366
I imagine you're like that
with most of your customers.

11:41.368 --> 11:45.570
Heavens, no. Only
the ones I find interesting.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.773
And I think you find me
interesting too.

11:50.943 --> 11:52.944
I do.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.913
Take me to dinner tonight.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.248
Miss Bloom,
I'm here to speak--

11:57.250 --> 11:59.851
I'm... I'm actually here
to speak to Lydia Hall

11:59.853 --> 12:01.786
about Gerald Sloan.

12:01.788 --> 12:04.823
Ah, all business, I see.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.692
Well, she's not here yet.

12:09.528 --> 12:13.331
You're at Station
Number... Four?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.633
Yes.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.903
Then that's where
I'll telephone you.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.506
Ahem!

12:21.508 --> 12:23.775
When Miss Hall arrives.
Mm-hm!

12:23.777 --> 12:26.044
Then too!

12:37.923 --> 12:40.425
(knocking): Sir,
the lads have yet

12:40.427 --> 12:42.293
to come up with the murder
weapon, unfortunately. They've

12:42.295 --> 12:45.263
turned the Star Room upside down
but have come up with nothing.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.165
I'm not surprised,
George. What did you

12:47.167 --> 12:49.367
find out about the victim?
Nothing again, sir.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.203
He's unemployed, yet he gave
his landlord six months advance

12:52.205 --> 12:54.105
in cash.
Family?

12:54.107 --> 12:56.508
None on record. In fact,
there seems to be no record

12:56.510 --> 12:59.277
of this chap prior to six months
ago, neither here or in Buffalo.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.046
No, there wouldn't be.
Sir?

13:02.048 --> 13:04.149
The birth certificate is a
forgery. "Gerald Sloan" doesn't

13:04.151 --> 13:07.685
exist. It appears
an excursion is in order.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.691
What is it with
these Americans?

13:13.693 --> 13:16.394
Plastering their flag
over every conceivable surface.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.963
National pride, sir.
I daresay the British

13:18.965 --> 13:21.332
aren't much different.
Yes, but our flag is subtle.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.235
Powerful in its simplicity.
I see.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.238
According to George's
directions, the police station

13:27.240 --> 13:29.174
should be somewhere
along this block.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.309
Let's hope his mind wasn't
on certain other things

13:31.311 --> 13:33.578
when he wrote them down.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.715
Sir,

13:37.717 --> 13:40.418
the instructions say that we are
to wait for a Detective Walker

13:40.420 --> 13:43.154
outside the police station.
Hm...

13:43.156 --> 13:45.323
(hubbub)

13:47.393 --> 13:49.394
(door closing)

13:49.396 --> 13:52.497
Murdoch and Brackenreid?

13:52.499 --> 13:55.433
Badges, please.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.102
Follow me.

14:05.244 --> 14:08.780
You want to know about Gerald
Sloan. So do a lot of people.

14:08.782 --> 14:11.316
Oh?
Though it hardly matters now.

14:11.318 --> 14:14.686
The... the truth is,
he's not Gerald Sloan.

14:14.688 --> 14:18.356
His real name is Gerry Sachs.
And just why did Sachs feel

14:18.358 --> 14:20.692
the need to change his name?
I caught him on a job,

14:20.694 --> 14:23.161
but rather than go to jail,
he turned informant and gave

14:23.163 --> 14:26.531
evidence against the head of
the enterprise. Sachs' testimony

14:26.533 --> 14:29.300
sent him away.
So I sent Sachs away.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.336
You forged
the birth certificate.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.538
In exchange for his testimony,
Sachs was given a new identity,

14:33.540 --> 14:35.907
some cash, and a train
ticket to a new city.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.742
He chose Toronto.
He didn't choose anything,

14:37.744 --> 14:40.278
we did.
You sent a criminal to my city

14:40.280 --> 14:42.447
without so much as a call?
Informing you

14:42.449 --> 14:45.049
of his whereabouts would have
defeated the purpose, Inspector.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.051
Unbelievable. I'll be having

14:47.053 --> 14:48.853
a word with your superiors
about this.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.923
I suppose it doesn't matter
anymore. Sachs was a test case.

14:51.925 --> 14:55.226
The Relocation Agreement Tactic.
But since they found him,

14:55.228 --> 14:57.795
I doubt I'll ever get
approval to do it again.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.831
Since who found him,
Detective? Just who

14:59.833 --> 15:02.734
did Mr. Sachs put in prison?
The founder of the Buffalo

15:02.736 --> 15:04.936
chapter of the Black Hand.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.705
Giuseppe Falcone.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.708
You know of him?
If you had bothered to let us

15:10.710 --> 15:12.777
know of your plans,
Sachs might still be alive.

15:12.779 --> 15:15.613
At any rate, I imagine the
Black Hand are still operating

15:15.615 --> 15:17.682
in spite of
Mr. Falcone's incarceration?

15:17.684 --> 15:20.285
We expected his son would
take over, Giuseppe Junior.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.654
But we haven't heard a peep
out of him for weeks.

15:22.656 --> 15:25.323
We want to talk to Falcone.
That'll take time to arrange.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.859
Oh, we've got plenty.
Did Mr. Sachs have any

15:27.861 --> 15:31.329
next of kin?
A wife and some children.

15:31.331 --> 15:35.400
Oh, may we..?
Better you than me.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.506
(baby crying in the distance)

15:41.508 --> 15:44.375
Gerry is really dead?
I'm afraid he is.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.645
We can arrange
for his body to be
sent back to you from Toronto.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.647
Don't bother.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.849
I'm not about to get
stuck with his funeral bill.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.619
I'm not sure
you know this, Mrs. Sachs,

15:54.621 --> 15:56.621
but your husband
was granted asylum

15:56.623 --> 15:58.957
in exchange for a testimony.
Oh, I know all about it.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.659
We were packed and ready.
But the bastard up and left

16:01.661 --> 16:03.728
without so much as a never-you-
mind and I never heard

16:03.730 --> 16:05.530
from him again.
So, you and your children were

16:05.532 --> 16:08.299
meant to go with him?
It was part of the deal.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.935
What cold hearted bastard
would leave his wife behind

16:10.937 --> 16:13.304
to support three children
all on her own?

16:13.306 --> 16:15.640
And yet you never followed.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.810
I would have if I'd
known where he'd gone.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.812
Where were you two nights ago?

16:20.814 --> 16:24.182
You're not serious. I was

16:24.184 --> 16:26.417
on a sixteen-hour shift
at the Larkin soapworks,

16:26.419 --> 16:28.219
which, thank the Lord,
I won't have to do much longer.

16:28.221 --> 16:31.956
Why do you say that?
My husband is dead, Detective.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.459
Now I can finally start over.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.802
(piano music)

17:01.587 --> 17:03.654
(chuckles from the crowd)

17:13.465 --> 17:15.833
Things have quieted
down here a little bit.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.803
A murder will do that. But it
is nice not having to fend off

17:18.805 --> 17:22.974
groping hands for one night.
The unwanted ones, at least.

17:22.976 --> 17:25.777
Are there many
unwanted ones?

17:25.779 --> 17:28.246
I have my regulars.

17:28.248 --> 17:31.916
The bespectacled
man, Eamon,

17:31.918 --> 17:35.453
but he's harmless. There's
a couple of Aldermen,

17:35.455 --> 17:38.322
who shall not be named.
And that Joe fellow

17:38.324 --> 17:40.358
is the worst, though.
He even gave me his room number

17:40.360 --> 17:43.761
at the Monarch Hotel. At least
he's moved on to Lydia now.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.531
So,

17:46.533 --> 17:50.301
are men in the habit of
giving you their room numbers?

17:50.303 --> 17:53.371
It happens. Though
there is one in particular

17:53.373 --> 17:55.740
I've yet to be offered.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.142
So,

17:58.144 --> 18:01.546
are you in the habit
of visiting men in their rooms.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.614
If I so choose.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.683
I see.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.586
Do you think
that improper?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.822
Do you think men are the only
ones who feel lust or passion?

18:10.824 --> 18:12.824
No, of course not.
But you think they're the only

18:12.826 --> 18:14.659
ones allowed to act on it.
I don't know. I don't know

18:14.661 --> 18:17.095
it's proper that a young woman--
If you cared all that much

18:17.097 --> 18:19.697
about propriety
you wouldn't be here.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.833
Nina...

18:21.835 --> 18:24.535
(applause)

18:30.008 --> 18:32.310
Excuse me, squire.
I'll have a beer

18:32.312 --> 18:34.212
and I'll take
the chicken please.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.647
Ugh, all out.
Well then, I'll take

18:36.649 --> 18:38.316
whatever you've got.
I'm sorry, sir,

18:38.318 --> 18:41.419
the kitchen has no food left.
Bollocks.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.187
What kind of restaurant
has no food?

18:43.189 --> 18:45.490
You are welcome
to come see for yourself.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.991
All we have left is the-Oop!

18:46.993 --> 18:50.528
refuse from the chicken special.
What refuse?

18:50.530 --> 18:52.864
The wings.
Inedible.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.732
At this point,

18:54.734 --> 18:56.567
I'd eat the bloody
feathers. Fry them up.

18:56.569 --> 19:00.505
Oh, but sir, they're
just... bone and skin.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.040
You're going to throw them
away, and I'm offering you

19:03.042 --> 19:05.409
good money instead.
Hm,

19:05.411 --> 19:07.979
if you're sure.
Go!

19:07.981 --> 19:10.781
Off you go. All right.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.316
Get him a beer!

19:16.455 --> 19:19.090
Mr. Falcone will be at the
police station in the morning.

19:19.092 --> 19:21.259
Excellent. Care
to join me?

19:21.261 --> 19:24.328
What is that?
Dinner.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.498
I've put some of this spicy
sauce on them. Try one.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.401
No, thank you.
Your loss.

19:30.403 --> 19:33.671
I'll tell you, Murdoch,
these chicken wings

19:33.673 --> 19:36.174
are the only good
thing about Buffalo.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.676
Will you look at that.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.712
The Canadians are
eating our garbage.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.967
Ahem.

20:02.969 --> 20:06.771
I can move the screen
if you'd like.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.974
I'm terribly sorry.

20:15.981 --> 20:18.482
I can come back
at another time.

20:18.484 --> 20:21.118
Why are you
in here, George?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.888
I was...

20:23.890 --> 20:26.724
I was looking
for Lydia Hall.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.827
I don't think
that's really why.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.263
I know what you want.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.799
I see how you look
at me when I'm on stage.

20:34.801 --> 20:39.070
I--

20:39.072 --> 20:42.173
Mm...

20:44.509 --> 20:47.578
Perhaps I misjudged.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.947
Hm!

21:00.459 --> 21:03.327
Perhaps I did not.

21:16.308 --> 21:18.909
Is that your bag?
It's Lydia's.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.312
What did that girl
get herself into?

21:21.314 --> 21:24.415
I have to go. I should
bring this down to the station.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.218
At this hour? I doubt anyone
will be there to see it.

21:27.220 --> 21:29.387
That's probably
true, but...

21:31.857 --> 21:34.325
The gun isn't going
anywhere, George.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.061
Neither are you.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.682
(engines, voices)

21:59.718 --> 22:02.420
Thank you.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.525
(Someone laughing)
Mr. Falcone.

22:07.527 --> 22:11.762
I hope you're not here to
malign my good name yet again.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.065
We're not here
to talk about the past.

22:14.067 --> 22:17.401
Oh no? Now I am intrigued.

22:17.403 --> 22:19.403
You knew this man.

22:19.405 --> 22:23.040
Gerry Sachs. Or
his more recent name,

22:23.042 --> 22:25.910
Gerald Sloan.
He testified against you.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.913
Yes, I know. I was
there when it happened.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.382
Gerry Sachs is dead.
He was murdered.

22:31.384 --> 22:34.118
It was only a matter of time.
How did you find out

22:34.120 --> 22:37.421
Mr. Sachs was in Toronto?
You just told me.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.090
Mr. Falcone,

22:39.092 --> 22:42.126
we know you didn't
kill Gerry Sachs,

22:42.128 --> 22:45.930
but we have strong evidence that
his murder is connected to you.

22:45.932 --> 22:48.766
Who did you order
to kill Sachs? Your son?

22:48.768 --> 22:51.168
I didn't order anyone.
But I cannot stop those

22:51.170 --> 22:54.071
loyal to me if they wish
to defend my honour.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.741
And there are
many loyal to me.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.076
Both men and women.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.379
On both sides
of the border.

23:09.521 --> 23:11.989
Nina! Nina, what in God's
name are you doing?

23:11.991 --> 23:13.891
I'm just wondering why
Lydia would need this.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.727
Nina, give me that. Oh God!

23:16.729 --> 23:19.797
This is evidence.
Your fingermarks

23:19.799 --> 23:21.999
are gonna be all over it now.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.869
(sigh)

23:26.671 --> 23:29.173
I need to go.

23:29.175 --> 23:32.243
As you wish.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.211
I mean, I really do.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.547
I have to get this down
at the station right away.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.183
You know where to find me.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.552
Right.

23:54.466 --> 23:57.101
(children's laughter)

23:59.504 --> 24:02.973
Good morning, Crabtree.
Oddly dressed for work.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.676
Sir, I was at the Star Room.
What, this morning?

24:05.678 --> 24:08.512
Do what you want on your own
time. But I'm not paying you

24:08.514 --> 24:10.681
to watch young girls prancing
around in their skivvies.

24:10.683 --> 24:13.050
Sir! I found it
in the effects

24:13.052 --> 24:15.586
of one of the dancers'
costumes. Lydia Hall's.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.988
Any fingermarks on it?
Yes, sir.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.124
Some of them will turn out to be
Nina Bloom's, but I assure you

24:20.126 --> 24:22.626
they were applied
long after the murder.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.495
I daren't ask
how that happened.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.298
What led you
to search the costumes?

24:27.300 --> 24:30.167
Well, I found myself in the
ladies' changing room, sir--

24:30.169 --> 24:32.002
Found yourself there, did you?
Why were you

24:32.004 --> 24:34.405
in the ladies' change room?
Well, I was interviewing

24:34.407 --> 24:36.173
Miss Bloom, you see.
And her answers

24:36.175 --> 24:38.742
led you to
Miss Hall's costume?

24:38.744 --> 24:41.378
No, not exactly.
Well then, just what,

24:41.380 --> 24:43.914
exactly, George? It could
be material to the case.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.083
Murdoch. What do you
think he was doing

24:46.085 --> 24:49.253
with a burlesque dancer
in her dressing room?

24:52.023 --> 24:54.525
Oh. I see.
On the job, no less.

24:54.527 --> 24:57.127
You'll want to thank
your lucky stars

24:57.129 --> 24:59.563
that your little
assignation revealed evidence.

24:59.565 --> 25:01.899
Otherwise we'd be having
a much different conversation

25:01.901 --> 25:05.736
right now, bugalugs.
Sir.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.374
George, a moment.
Yes, sir.

25:12.844 --> 25:15.579
The Black Hand?
Back in Toronto?

25:15.581 --> 25:17.882
So it would seem.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.917
You understand
how this changes things?

25:19.919 --> 25:22.753
Where is Miss Hall now?

25:22.755 --> 25:24.989
At the Star Room?
No, sir. She didn't go to work

25:24.991 --> 25:27.091
either last night.
I'll... find her.

25:27.093 --> 25:30.194
Alright, George.
Sir,

25:30.196 --> 25:32.363
I would like to employ
the assistance of Miss Bloom.

25:32.365 --> 25:35.633
With your permission.
She could be involved in this.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.701
I truly don't
believe she is, sir.

25:37.703 --> 25:40.771
Tread carefully, George.

25:42.841 --> 25:45.376
Sir.
Crabtree.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.278
Good advice.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.380
A woman like that will
most likely eat him alive.

25:49.382 --> 25:53.384
Julia thinks that
George is just lonely.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.553
That's one word
for it, I suppose.

25:55.555 --> 25:58.355
I'll call Margaret.
Sir?

25:58.357 --> 26:01.292
I'm certain Margaret can
find him a pleasant young lady

26:01.294 --> 26:04.762
to take his mind off things.
Oh yes, of course, of course.

26:04.764 --> 26:07.731
Julia and I
could host a dinner

26:07.733 --> 26:10.434
this Saturday evening.
Saturday it is.

26:10.436 --> 26:13.804
Lydia isn't a killer.
She's barely a dancer.

26:13.806 --> 26:16.340
All the poor girl wants
is to find a husband.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.475
Besides, she was on stage
with me the whole time.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.611
I know, Nina. But the gun
was in her costume. She must

26:20.613 --> 26:23.480
know something.

26:23.482 --> 26:26.517
About last night...

26:26.519 --> 26:28.986
What about it?

26:28.988 --> 26:31.989
It was enjoyable.
I mean, it was beyond...

26:31.991 --> 26:34.725
(She chuckles.)
I mean...

26:34.727 --> 26:37.194
what I mean is we hardly
know each other, and--

26:37.196 --> 26:39.096
And what?
Well, I'm sure you have

26:39.098 --> 26:41.465
certain expectations.
Expectations?

26:41.467 --> 26:43.901
Well, I just wanted you
to know I am an honourable man.

26:43.903 --> 26:47.671
(laughing): I don't want
to marry you, George!

26:47.673 --> 26:49.640
Well... no,

26:49.642 --> 26:52.042
of course not.
Not yet.

26:52.044 --> 26:55.279
Not ever. I hardly
even know you.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.881
And besides, I'm not
that kind of woman.

26:57.883 --> 27:00.284
What kind?
The marrying kind.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.786
You shouldn't think so little
of yourself. I sure many men

27:02.788 --> 27:05.189
would disregard your past.
I shouldn't care if they did

27:05.191 --> 27:08.058
or didn't. I'm not like Lydia,
I don't dance at the burlesque

27:08.060 --> 27:12.329
only to snag a husband.
Why do you then?

27:12.331 --> 27:14.765
Because I enjoy it.

27:14.767 --> 27:17.868
I won't deny myself the things
that bring me pleasure,

27:17.870 --> 27:20.504
and that includes you.

27:20.506 --> 27:22.840
If you think less of me
because of it, then so be it.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.975
I don't.
Good.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.077
Then should you want to
continue enjoying my company,

27:27.079 --> 27:29.847
I will welcome you.
If not, I am happy to part now.

27:29.849 --> 27:32.916
I don't want that.

27:32.918 --> 27:35.386
Then stop questioning
the right or wrong of it.

27:35.388 --> 27:37.454
It simply is.

27:41.726 --> 27:43.527
I don't know anything
about any black hands

27:43.529 --> 27:45.929
or any foreigners. All I know
is you fellows coming around

27:45.931 --> 27:47.931
is really bad for business.
The sooner we catch

27:47.933 --> 27:50.100
who's responsible, the sooner
we will stop coming around.

27:50.102 --> 27:53.237
Look, you're
the bartender here.

27:53.239 --> 27:56.573
You know better than anyone
what goes on in this place.

27:56.575 --> 27:58.509
Who do you know
that has connections

27:58.511 --> 28:01.211
to the Falcone
family out of Buffalo?

28:01.213 --> 28:04.682
My new busboy is
from Buffalo. Miles Hart.

28:04.684 --> 28:07.351
The same busboy who
discovered the body?

28:07.353 --> 28:09.620
Yes.
Where is he now?

28:09.622 --> 28:12.122
Look at the state
of this place.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.525
Not here, obviously.

28:16.494 --> 28:18.762
There might be one more place.
But she would have to be

28:18.764 --> 28:20.831
really desperate to hide there.
Where is that?

28:20.833 --> 28:24.401
Her parents' home. This way.

28:27.172 --> 28:29.807
So, you really
believe that...

28:29.809 --> 28:32.242
you can do whatever you want,
regardless of the consequences?

28:32.244 --> 28:34.978
What consequences?
Your reputation.

28:34.980 --> 28:39.049
My reputation is not who I am.
Well I know that but others--

28:39.051 --> 28:41.485
Do you always act the way
others expect you to?

28:41.487 --> 28:44.488
Well I don't know.
What is it you want?

28:44.490 --> 28:47.391
What is it you
aspire to, George?

28:47.393 --> 28:50.961
Respectability, I suppose,
like anybody else.

28:50.963 --> 28:54.498
So, you grew up expecting
to find a girl, marry her,

28:54.500 --> 28:57.634
have a family, and
live happily ever after.

28:57.636 --> 29:00.504
Yes, more or less.
Has it happened?

29:00.506 --> 29:02.306
No.
Does your life have

29:02.308 --> 29:05.242
less meaning because of it?
Does it make you less of a man?

29:05.244 --> 29:08.312
I don't know.
I hope not.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.848
All I'm saying is
make your own choice.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.850
Just because you were told
life should be a certain way,

29:12.852 --> 29:15.352
doesn't mean it's the
only way. Marry, don't marry,

29:15.354 --> 29:18.455
what does it matter?
This is it.

29:18.457 --> 29:21.458
(knocking): Lydia?

29:24.596 --> 29:26.597
Oh, Nina!
(She gasps.)

29:26.599 --> 29:28.766
Miss Hall! Miss Hall!
I didn't say anything.

29:28.768 --> 29:31.268
I didn't say anything,
I swear! Please, let me go!

29:31.270 --> 29:33.837
I'm Constable George Crabtree.
I'm here to help you.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.778
Let me just
get my coat.

29:45.416 --> 29:47.618
Miss Hall if you just take a
seat here, Detective Murdoch

29:47.620 --> 29:50.254
will be right with you.
Giltman, fetch the detective.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.589
If you didn't do
anything wrong,

29:52.591 --> 29:55.459
then just tell them the truth.
And if I did?

29:55.461 --> 29:59.029
Oh Lydia. Don't go
too hard on her.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.832
She's a simple girl really.
Oh, Nina, Detective Murdoch is

30:01.834 --> 30:04.234
the fairest man I know. Listen,

30:04.236 --> 30:07.337
I would never have found her
without you. Thank you for that.

30:07.339 --> 30:10.440
You're welcome. But before I
go, I'd like to claim my reward.

30:10.442 --> 30:13.043
Your reward..?

30:13.045 --> 30:16.480
(whistling and hooting)

30:16.482 --> 30:19.183
Crabtree!!
Sir!

30:19.185 --> 30:22.719
Miss Bloom. The constabulary
thanks you for your services.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.988
Oh I've already
been thanked, Inspector.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.857
Now, if you don't mind,
we have work to do.

30:26.859 --> 30:30.427
As do I. At the Star Room.
New show every week.

30:30.429 --> 30:33.564
Goodbye, George.

30:38.236 --> 30:42.172
Right, you lot, back to work!
(agitated chatter)

30:42.174 --> 30:44.374
What do you think
this is, a bordello?

30:44.376 --> 30:46.643
No, sir.
I'm sure there are files

30:46.645 --> 30:48.478
that need filing.
Get up them stairs

30:48.480 --> 30:50.981
and keep your bloody head down.
Sir.

30:54.385 --> 30:56.553
This gun

30:56.555 --> 30:58.989
was found in your costume.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.757
How did it come to be there?

31:00.759 --> 31:03.360
I don't know!

31:03.362 --> 31:05.362
Miss Hall,

31:05.364 --> 31:08.332
you must realize
that, at the moment,

31:08.334 --> 31:10.968
you are in
serious trouble.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.970
Obstruction of
an investigation,

31:12.972 --> 31:15.873
and possibly,
accessory to murder.

31:15.875 --> 31:20.844
Now, how did the gun come to be
amongst your personal effects?

31:20.846 --> 31:23.614
That night,
I was on stage.

31:23.616 --> 31:26.083
Afterwards I went
straight to my dressing room,

31:26.085 --> 31:29.152
as I always do after my
performance, to rest a moment.

31:29.154 --> 31:31.922
I didn't even know
what had happened.

31:31.924 --> 31:34.491
Somebody yelled that no one
was to leave, the police

31:34.493 --> 31:36.660
were on their way.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.562
That's when he came in--

31:38.564 --> 31:40.564
Who?

31:40.566 --> 31:43.300
It was all I could do
to fight him off.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.903
Miss Hall,
who came in?

31:48.840 --> 31:50.908
I can't tell you.

31:50.910 --> 31:53.143
He told me not to.

31:59.784 --> 32:02.286
Miss Hall says a man
came into the dressing room

32:02.288 --> 32:04.688
after Mr. Sachs
was killed.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.323
So, once he heard the police
had been called and knew

32:06.325 --> 32:07.991
he was trapped, he must
have followed Miss Hall

32:07.993 --> 32:10.260
into her dressing room, and then
hid the weapon in her costume.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.529
A plausible scenario.
What we need now

32:12.531 --> 32:14.998
is for her to
identify her assailant.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.900
That Hart fellow
from Buffalo,

32:16.902 --> 32:19.269
I had Thompson bring him in.
He may be our man.

32:19.271 --> 32:22.205
I'll see what
I can find out.

32:22.207 --> 32:24.975
We have a suspect.

32:24.977 --> 32:27.444
Now, I would like you to
tell me if it's the man you saw

32:27.446 --> 32:29.846
in the dressing room
after the murder.

32:29.848 --> 32:32.549
No. No!
Absolutely not!

32:32.551 --> 32:35.185
If you can
identify him,

32:35.187 --> 32:37.487
he'll be arrested.
And you will

32:37.489 --> 32:39.656
no longer be in danger.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.725
Is this the man?

32:45.229 --> 32:47.864
(sighing): That's
the new busboy, Miles;

32:47.866 --> 32:50.367
of course
it wasn't him.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.769
It was one
of the patrons.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.805
Can you describe him?

32:57.976 --> 33:01.611
Young lady, you are
trying my patience.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.250
He's been
coming around now

33:07.252 --> 33:09.353
for a few weeks.
He calls himself Joe.

33:09.355 --> 33:12.789
Thank you.

33:15.893 --> 33:18.161
You heard all that?
We did.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.664
Silly old girl.
She must be daft to dance

33:20.666 --> 33:22.899
in a place like that anyway.
Sir,

33:22.901 --> 33:25.402
isn't Giuseppe
Italian for Joseph?

33:25.404 --> 33:27.437
You're thinking this
Joe fellow could be

33:27.439 --> 33:30.340
Giuseppe Falcone Junior?
It's a possibility.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.243
Sirs. If Giuseppe
is Joe,

33:33.245 --> 33:35.679
I know where
to find him.

33:38.282 --> 33:40.350
(chatter and birds chirping)

33:42.253 --> 33:45.589
Somewhere
you'd rather be?

33:45.591 --> 33:47.791
No, sir.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.926
I telephoned
from the exchange.

33:49.928 --> 33:53.296
So, if Mr. Falcone Junior is
paying the staff to warn him,

33:53.298 --> 33:55.632
he'll be coming out
any moment.

33:57.568 --> 33:59.469
Look, Crabtree, I'm glad
you're having yourself

33:59.471 --> 34:02.406
a bit of fun with that dancer.
She is a looker. But be careful.

34:02.408 --> 34:05.509
Careful, sir?

34:05.511 --> 34:08.111
Women like that
are only after one thing.

34:08.113 --> 34:10.747
Look at yourself:
nice lad, good prospects.

34:10.749 --> 34:13.784
Not the sort that she
usually crosses paths with.

34:13.786 --> 34:16.753
She may be trying to entrap
you, George, into marriage.

34:16.755 --> 34:19.890
Sirs, she's not interested
in that, she's told me as much.

34:19.892 --> 34:21.892
Of course she did.

34:21.894 --> 34:23.960
Your brain's so addled you can't
see the wood for the trees.

34:23.962 --> 34:26.863
With all due respect, it's
hardly any of your business.

34:26.865 --> 34:29.433
End it now, Crabtree.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.935
I'm afraid the
Inspector is right, George.

34:31.937 --> 34:33.970
You as well, sir?
Get smart.

34:33.972 --> 34:35.872
You wouldn't want
a woman like that raising

34:35.874 --> 34:38.975
your children now, would you?
Considering who raised me,

34:38.977 --> 34:41.344
I wouldn't think it
much of a problem, sir.

34:47.085 --> 34:51.188
That's him. I recognize
him from the Star Room.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.824
Giuseppe Falcone?

34:53.826 --> 34:56.359
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

34:56.361 --> 34:59.362
We know who you are,
and what you've been up to.

34:59.364 --> 35:02.666
Congratulations.
Don't be smug.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.701
Your father can't help you
beat a murder charge

35:04.703 --> 35:07.437
from jail, now can he?
Go ahead and charge me.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.473
You can't prove a damn thing.

35:09.475 --> 35:12.776
But it's going to be fun
watching you <i>buffoni</i> try.

35:19.317 --> 35:21.618
Sachs deserved
every bullet he got.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.388
You were at the Star Room
at the time of the murder?

35:25.390 --> 35:27.557
I gave my statement
to one of your constables.

35:27.559 --> 35:30.393
Which left out
your little sojourn

35:30.395 --> 35:33.263
into the dressing room whereupon
you hid the murder weapon.

35:33.265 --> 35:36.366
That's a nice
story! Look,

35:36.368 --> 35:38.201
I'm not saying
I didn't kill him.

35:38.203 --> 35:40.604
Then say you did.
Why should I?

35:43.207 --> 35:47.144
This gun was found
amongst the dancers' costumes

35:47.146 --> 35:49.045
at the Star Room.

35:49.047 --> 35:51.648
No one's gonna
say that's mine.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.450
They don't have to.

35:53.452 --> 35:56.119
Your fingermarks are on it.
That's all the proof we need.

35:56.121 --> 35:59.556
Wait. Wait.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.392
Yes, that's my gun.

36:02.394 --> 36:05.295
But I didn't kill anybody.
Right.

36:05.297 --> 36:08.031
No, really!
I was going to.

36:08.033 --> 36:11.801
I mean, I was supposed
to do it. Weeks ago.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.037
I just...

36:14.039 --> 36:16.039
I couldn't.

36:16.041 --> 36:17.908
But I'm a Falcone;

36:17.910 --> 36:20.544
I had to take
the credit.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.879
Even though
you didn't do it.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.382
It can still
be me, can't it?

36:25.384 --> 36:27.651
Just... without
going to jail?

36:30.721 --> 36:33.723
Sir, the bullet did not
come from Falcone's gun.

36:33.725 --> 36:37.127
So he's telling the truth?
It would appear so.

36:37.129 --> 36:40.096
But he was sent
here for that purpose.

36:40.098 --> 36:43.633
His father did indeed know that
Mr. Sachs was here in Toronto.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.603
So then, who told
Falcone Senior?

36:46.605 --> 36:50.040
<i>It was that dancer.</i>

36:50.042 --> 36:52.542
She showed up in Buffalo,
mouthing off about Gerry.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.445
Which dancer was in Buffalo?
You know,

36:55.447 --> 36:58.248
the one who led me on.
The... the redhead.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.483
Gerry already had
a wife, back in Buffalo,

37:00.485 --> 37:02.586
but he said
he wanted to marry me.

37:02.588 --> 37:05.388
He told you that?
He told me everything.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.891
That he was a thief back
in Buffalo, but he wanted

37:07.893 --> 37:10.293
to go straight. So he changed
his name and came here

37:10.295 --> 37:12.429
to start over.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.898
I'm afraid
that's not quite true.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.434
It is. He wanted to marry me,

37:17.436 --> 37:19.569
only his wife
wouldn't let him.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.405
So you decided to go to
Buffalo to confront his wife.

37:22.407 --> 37:25.208
I thought that if I could show
her that Gerry was lost to her,

37:25.210 --> 37:28.979
that... she would let him go.

37:28.981 --> 37:31.815
And what did
Mrs. Sachs say to you?

37:31.817 --> 37:35.151
She wanted a divorce.
She even had a new beau.

37:35.153 --> 37:37.854
Only, she didn't know
where Gerry was.

37:37.856 --> 37:41.324
So you told her.
Of course!

37:41.326 --> 37:44.694
I told Gerry that
everything was worked out.

37:44.696 --> 37:48.031
He was so mad at me,
I never understood why.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.400
Gerry Sachs was
given a new identity

37:50.402 --> 37:53.303
in exchange for his testimony
against a powerful criminal.

37:53.305 --> 37:56.072
What?

37:56.074 --> 38:00.243
His family was to join him,
but he abandoned them instead.

38:02.246 --> 38:04.681
He was never going
to marry me, was he?

38:04.683 --> 38:07.150
He lied to me.

38:07.152 --> 38:10.186
About everything.

38:10.188 --> 38:14.291
Oh my God. I told them
where Gerry was!

38:14.293 --> 38:18.228
He was killed because
of me. It was all my fault!

38:21.799 --> 38:23.733
I ju-I just
wanted a husband.

38:23.735 --> 38:26.670
I just wanted to be able
to walk down the street

38:26.672 --> 38:28.905
with my head held high.

38:31.008 --> 38:34.210
Miss Hall told Mrs. Sachs

38:34.212 --> 38:37.414
that her husband was here in
Toronto. Yet Mrs. Sachs told us

38:37.416 --> 38:40.183
she had no idea where he was.
Why lie to us?

38:40.185 --> 38:42.485
She didn't kill her husband.
The soapworks confirmed

38:42.487 --> 38:44.754
that she worked
a sixteen-hour shift that day.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.357
She didn't kill anyone.
Go on.

38:47.359 --> 38:50.193
Well, sir, Mrs. Sachs
told Miss Hall that she had

38:50.195 --> 38:52.829
a new beau and that
she intended to remarry.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.398
So you think the new beau told
Falcone where Sachs

38:55.400 --> 38:57.400
was hiding, expecting
him to take care of it.

38:57.402 --> 39:00.003
Which Falcone did
by sending his son here.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.871
But Junior didn't do
what he was supposed to.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.674
So perhaps this mystery
beau decided to take care

39:04.676 --> 39:07.110
of Mr. Sachs himself.

39:07.112 --> 39:10.413
So all we have to do now
is find the bugger.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.482
(chatter and horses' hooves
on pavement)

39:15.052 --> 39:17.987
No one
in the Star Room

39:17.989 --> 39:20.423
saw or heard a thing.

39:20.425 --> 39:23.727
Not even George, who was seated
almost on top of the victim.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.729
Why should anyone
have noticed anything

39:25.731 --> 39:28.865
if they were so fixated
on the stage, as you say?

39:28.867 --> 39:31.868
Only something unexpected
would have diverted attention.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.571
But isn't a man walking
through a crowded room

39:34.573 --> 39:37.841
with a towel unexpected?

39:37.843 --> 39:40.877
(piano music)

39:43.414 --> 39:46.149
(gunshot and fracas)

39:50.388 --> 39:53.156
You're sure he's here?
The bartender at the Star Room

39:53.158 --> 39:55.258
said he was headed back
to Buffalo. Let's hope

39:55.260 --> 39:57.527
he wasn't lying.
I doubt it. He succeeded

39:57.529 --> 39:59.829
where Junior failed. Falcone
will want to reward him.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.665
(knocking loudly)

40:02.667 --> 40:05.635
Go back to Toronto
and leave me alone.

40:05.637 --> 40:08.071
Mrs. Sachs, step aside
or you'll be arrested

40:08.073 --> 40:09.906
for harbouring a fugitive.
There's no one here!

40:09.908 --> 40:11.908
Hold your horses,
sunshine! Come here!

40:11.910 --> 40:15.078
Leave him alone! Miles only
wanted to give me a better life.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.313
Miles Hart. You are under
arrest for the murder

40:17.315 --> 40:19.783
of Gerry Sachs.
You can't arrest me.

40:19.785 --> 40:22.585
I'm an American citizen.

40:24.355 --> 40:26.356
Extradition papers.

40:26.358 --> 40:28.591
Canada's this way, Mr. Hart.

40:30.528 --> 40:32.896
Ma'am.

40:39.303 --> 40:42.739
George!

40:42.741 --> 40:45.241
This is a nice surprise.

40:45.243 --> 40:48.311
Can you unlace me?

40:48.313 --> 40:51.848
I wasn't expecting
to see you tonight.

40:51.850 --> 40:55.552
Aren't you supposed to be out
protecting our fine citizenry?

40:57.521 --> 41:00.190
I should tell you that I'm
otherwise engaged this evening.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.728
Well, that's quite a face.

41:05.730 --> 41:08.298
Could use some cheering up.

41:10.401 --> 41:12.902
What's wrong?

41:12.904 --> 41:15.104
Tell me.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.407
Nina...

41:17.409 --> 41:21.110
I had words with
my Inspector. About you.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.282
What did he say?

41:33.791 --> 41:35.992
Nothing.

41:37.928 --> 41:39.996
Nothing at all.

41:48.739 --> 41:51.541
A casual evening
amongst friends.

41:51.543 --> 41:53.710
That's exactly
what George needs

41:53.712 --> 41:56.145
to get his mind off
of his burlesque dancer.

41:56.147 --> 41:59.182
William, it isn't
for you to judge

41:59.184 --> 42:01.518
with whom George
chooses to spend his time.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.353
I only mean that...

42:03.355 --> 42:05.221
George deserves better.

42:05.223 --> 42:08.358
You don't even know her.
Her reputation.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.894
Well, consider my reputation.
Is that how you would judge me?

42:10.896 --> 42:13.930
So you and the Inspector
are delivering

42:13.932 --> 42:16.966
this poor woman to George?
Oh, she's a fine young lady.

42:16.968 --> 42:20.236
Her father owns a stationery
store on Avenue Road.

42:20.238 --> 42:23.106
Oh! We know how much
George loves pens!

42:23.108 --> 42:25.842
Right!

42:25.844 --> 42:27.744
William, I can't see
how this is a good idea

42:27.746 --> 42:29.779
from any perspective.
Let's make our guests

42:29.781 --> 42:32.315
feel welcome,
shall we?

42:32.317 --> 42:34.684
We'll head down to the dining
room when George appears.

42:34.686 --> 42:36.452
Oh!
Cheese?

42:36.454 --> 42:39.155
Must be nice to have someone
do all the cooking for you.

42:39.157 --> 42:41.858
You should have tasted the
abomination Thomas made for me

42:41.860 --> 42:44.327
last night.
Sir, you didn't.

42:44.329 --> 42:47.163
I did indeed. Margaret
got to enjoy the spicy wings

42:47.165 --> 42:49.299
of Buffalo.
The boys loved them.

42:49.301 --> 42:51.334
Ugh, ghastly.
Will Mr. Crabtree

42:51.336 --> 42:53.703
be here soon?
I'm sure he will.

42:53.705 --> 42:56.139
But don't make yourself
too available. A good man

42:56.141 --> 42:58.641
relishes the challenge--
(knocking)

42:58.643 --> 43:01.578
Ah! That must be
the man of the hour now.

43:01.580 --> 43:03.613
Now get to your feet.
Let him see

43:03.615 --> 43:06.115
what awaits.
Welcome!

43:06.117 --> 43:08.751
Thank you for the kind
invitation, Doctor Ogden.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.853
We're pleased
to have you, George.

43:10.855 --> 43:12.789
I hope you don't mind,
I brought a guest.

43:12.791 --> 43:14.624
I am so delighted
to have been included

43:14.626 --> 43:16.459
in your little soiree.
Crabtree.

43:16.461 --> 43:20.196
Thomas!!
Not again!

43:20.198 --> 43:22.198
Everyone. Meet
my new sweetheart,

43:22.200 --> 43:25.134
Miss Nina Bloom.

43:25.136 --> 43:28.037
(chuckling from Dr. Ogden)

43:32.076 --> 43:35.011
(theme music)
