08:26.237 --> 08:28.967
Actually, we really do
need that pass, man.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.651
Unfortunately,
Ders' micro-machine penis

08:31.776 --> 08:33.320
doesn't classify him as handicapped.

08:33.445 --> 08:34.754
[Laughter]
It should, though.

08:34.879 --> 08:37.726
It should, though, it's so small.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.726
You wanna see it?
You keep calling it small?

08:39.851 --> 08:41.105
Might as well just show it to you.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.328
[As cat]
Wait, I wanna see it.

08:42.453 --> 08:43.796
I got front-row seats over here.

08:43.921 --> 08:46.860
My dick's bigger than yours.
[Laughter]

08:47.026 --> 08:48.701
- You wanna see it?
- I've seen it. I've seen it!

08:48.826 --> 08:50.281
- Whoa, slow down.
- I've seen it.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.905
Keep your grub worm
in its hole, okay?

08:53.030 --> 08:55.368
I can tell you it's bigger
than a cat's dick.

08:55.534 --> 08:58.077
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry about that, dude.

08:58.202 --> 09:01.248
But will you help a brother
that's actually a cousin out,

09:01.373 --> 09:04.461
just 'cause... my brother?

09:04.627 --> 09:05.986
We get it, dude.
We get it.

09:06.253 --> 09:07.631
Sit in your chair, chub up.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.591
But all we're asking for
is a parking pass.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.718
- That's it.
- Yeah.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.846
All right,
you guys can have the pass.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.529
- It's cool.
- What'd I say? What'd I say?

09:15.654 --> 09:17.557
Now, get on out of here.
I'm about to watch

09:17.723 --> 09:20.227
a chick masturbate with a summer
sausage on the Internet.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.896
Oh, no, you don't.
Devin.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.565
These boys just offered you a job,

09:24.731 --> 09:25.873
and you are taking it.

09:25.998 --> 09:28.861
Mom, I'm not taking some stupid <i>job!</i>

09:29.027 --> 09:30.610
Can we not do this again?

09:30.735 --> 09:32.530
Your disability is about to run out,

09:32.696 --> 09:33.746
and I am not footing the bill

09:33.871 --> 09:35.415
while you masturbate your life away!

09:35.540 --> 09:38.078
- Mama!
- Dude, it's cool.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.746
You can just come
and try it out... I work there.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.555
- No!
- Devin Demamp!

09:41.680 --> 09:44.418
I will call animal services
to come for your cats.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.463
Someone get me a bucket and soap.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.258
Big fat's about to get a job.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.469
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.738
[All talking at once]

09:55.863 --> 09:57.139
- Oh, yeah.
- Like a glove.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.341
Livin' that handicap life!

09:59.466 --> 10:01.560
- This... is parking.
- There we go.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.613
- Yeah, mama!
- There you go, big buddy.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.048
I don't want to sound arrogant,

10:06.173 --> 10:07.733
but I feel like I was
always meant to park

10:07.858 --> 10:09.117
in handicap spots.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.986
You're basically
a handicapped dude, my brother.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.030
- Don't I know it.
- Now, this is parking!

10:14.196 --> 10:15.423
I just said that.
This is parking.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.491
There's no other way
to say it, though.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.744
- This is parking.
- Hey, guys!

10:18.910 --> 10:21.496
I'm stuck!
[Beatboxing]

10:21.621 --> 10:24.541
Yo!
Seriously, I'm stuck.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.834
Yeah, I forgot how fat you were, bud.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.378
Can't get out of the car.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.589
So welcome to the dragon's lair.

10:36.714 --> 10:38.424
That's what I call the break room.

10:38.549 --> 10:39.725
- It's pretty sick.
- Yeah.

10:39.850 --> 10:40.860
We're gonna go talk to Alice,

10:40.985 --> 10:42.028
get you a job!

10:42.153 --> 10:43.562
Whoa, whoa.

10:43.687 --> 10:44.895
Pump the brakes, fellas.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.231
You guys already have
the parking spot,

10:46.356 --> 10:47.732
you're good to go.

10:47.857 --> 10:49.434
And as long as my mom thinks
I have a job here,

10:49.559 --> 10:50.535
I'm good to go.

10:50.660 --> 10:52.102
But there ain't a chance in hell

10:52.227 --> 10:54.105
that I'm clocking in
to this fart factory.

10:54.230 --> 10:55.322
- Not happening.
- All right.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.534
All right, well, hey, here is the TV.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.013
So enjoy <i>The View.</i>
The show. The show <i>The View.</i>

11:02.286 --> 11:03.982
All right, guys, let's go.
We got work to do.

11:04.107 --> 11:06.500
Uh, we make the world turn,
unlike you.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.921
That and my stomach.

11:09.046 --> 11:10.671
[Laughter]

11:10.837 --> 11:12.505
Stay fat, bro.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.461
Ow!
[Laughing]

11:14.586 --> 11:18.220
- All right. Love you, bro.
- Love you too, dude.

11:18.386 --> 11:23.642
Don't mind if I squeeze...
Yes.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.562
How you doing?

11:29.500 --> 11:32.942
Some butt you got there.
Yeah.

11:33.108 --> 11:34.069
Do you wipe it?

11:34.235 --> 11:36.738
[Laughs]
I'm kidding.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.323
But seriously, can I?

11:38.489 --> 11:40.367
I don't appreciate you
talking to me like that.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.828
Okay. I'm being selfish.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.205
How 'bout I start over?

11:45.371 --> 11:48.249
Do you, uh, wanna suck my tits?

11:48.415 --> 11:50.753
[Laughs]
Come here.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.986
This is called a floor fan.

11:53.477 --> 11:55.662
It goes on a floor, and...

11:56.131 --> 11:57.202
[Whispers indistinctly]

11:57.327 --> 11:58.670
What? My yogurt?

11:58.795 --> 12:00.512
In the break room?
Oh, my go...

12:00.678 --> 12:02.741
I gotta call you back.
About to catch me a case.

12:02.866 --> 12:04.576
Yo, let's go!

12:04.701 --> 12:06.211
You don't eat a man's yogurt.
That's all I can eat.

12:06.336 --> 12:07.546
You know what I'm saying?
I'm on a diet.

12:07.671 --> 12:08.748
This is unbelievable.

12:08.873 --> 12:10.149
- Someone eatin' my yogurt.
- Fight?

12:10.274 --> 12:11.818
I will kill a man right now.

12:11.943 --> 12:13.319
Who's fighting?
Is someone fighting?

12:13.444 --> 12:15.788
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

12:15.913 --> 12:17.423
You can't be snackin'
on my snacks like that!

12:17.548 --> 12:19.392
Gimme the news, not
the dick breath, ya butt slug!

12:19.517 --> 12:21.324
- I'll eat what I want!
- You got no respect

12:21.490 --> 12:22.761
for another man's live cultures.

12:22.886 --> 12:23.896
We about to get it on!

12:24.021 --> 12:25.536
Okay, let's go!

12:25.702 --> 12:26.932
[All shouting at once]

12:27.057 --> 12:28.500
Get off my cousin!

12:28.625 --> 12:31.102
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Watch it, dude.

12:31.227 --> 12:32.536
Okay, what the hell
is going on in here?

12:32.661 --> 12:34.939
Listen, lady, why don't you just...

12:35.064 --> 12:37.507
[Charming muzak plays]

12:37.673 --> 12:42.443
Why don't I apologize
to everyone in this room

12:42.568 --> 12:44.850
for what I just did...
Totally uncalled for.

12:44.975 --> 12:46.182
I'm sorry, everyone.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.769
Sure. Great.
What are you?

12:48.935 --> 12:51.521
He's my cousin!
[Laughter]

12:51.687 --> 12:53.649
Of course he is.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.060
And since we're hiring,
I figured he'd be

12:55.185 --> 12:57.229
a great member
of the sales team, right?

12:57.354 --> 13:00.238
- Plus, he's a local hero.
- Yeah. He sure is.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.573
Jumped in front of a fire truck,
saved a little girl's life.

13:02.739 --> 13:05.535
Miss, I promise you
I will give you my best,

13:05.701 --> 13:06.911
and I will deliver.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.405
All right, whatever, but you three

13:08.530 --> 13:09.940
are responsible for training him.

13:10.065 --> 13:12.626
And if he doesn't deliver,
it's on you.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.611
What are you looking at?
Come on, let's go!

13:14.736 --> 13:17.147
- He ate my yogurt.
- Team Demamp!

13:17.272 --> 13:21.952
Yes. Aw, dude, we just
got you a job. Team Demamp.

13:22.077 --> 13:24.137
- Oh, hi.
- Cat lover?

13:24.303 --> 13:26.690
Oh, yes. Uh, it's actually
the anniversary

13:26.815 --> 13:28.659
of my cat Brent Hoffman's death.

13:28.784 --> 13:31.019
I miss my dead, dead cat.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.230
- I am so sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.033
Now I'm the proud owner of seven,

13:35.158 --> 13:37.484
which some people think is weird.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.611
You know, I think it's weird
if you don't have more.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.507
Well, I did until this one died.

13:41.632 --> 13:43.508
[Both laughing]

13:43.633 --> 13:46.611
You know, I have a dozen cats myself.

13:46.736 --> 13:48.495
You should come over and breed.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.747
With my cats.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.583
- Oh.
- Cats.

13:52.708 --> 13:53.959
You should breed with my cats.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.668
Well, yeah, that would be nice.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.086
- Yeah. Okay.
- But I should...

13:57.252 --> 13:58.690
- I should go.
- Totally.

13:58.815 --> 14:00.158
- It was nice to meet you.
- So nice meeting you.

14:00.283 --> 14:02.801
- Yeah.
- Okay. We'll see ya.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.429
- Okay...
- Damn.

14:04.554 --> 14:08.765
Move over, Ms. Quiznos,
big fat's got a new chick.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.402
[Laughter]

14:10.527 --> 14:12.004
If you really wanted
to make a good joke,

14:12.129 --> 14:15.104
you could have said
"move over miss Wendy's,"

14:15.270 --> 14:17.042
- 'cause it's a woman.
- You see this?

14:17.167 --> 14:19.026
It means not Wendy's.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.646
- Mmm, toasty!
- Okay.

14:20.771 --> 14:22.180
- Yeah, that's hardcore.
- That gets me hungry, dude!

14:22.305 --> 14:23.238
That's hardcore.

14:30.077 --> 14:33.356
Telamericorp's sales
techniques could be summarized

14:33.481 --> 14:35.584
as, I don't know, I guess the...

14:35.750 --> 14:38.045
All right, you're gonna
want to listen to this.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.396
Shh.
I'm kinda in the middle

14:40.521 --> 14:42.198
of being in love here, Ders.

14:42.323 --> 14:44.166
Just listen to Ders.
He's the best in the biz.

14:44.291 --> 14:46.536
We'll get you on the phone.
You'll be stacking cash, man.

14:46.661 --> 14:48.405
Yeah, man, you could make it rain

14:48.530 --> 14:50.349
on Jillian's nude sleeping self.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.975
Hey, you know what?
I got a better idea.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.510
You wanna hear a song I wrote, guys?

14:53.635 --> 14:56.312
- Sure.
- [Flatulence] Ooh...

14:56.478 --> 14:58.148
[Laughter]

14:58.314 --> 15:00.108
- I gotta let this one fly, boys.
- Oh, that's foul.

15:00.275 --> 15:03.487
[All talking at once]

15:03.612 --> 15:05.222
Smells like waffles.

15:05.347 --> 15:07.425
No, it doesn't smell like
anything from this planet.

15:07.550 --> 15:08.927
How many waffles
have you been eating?

15:09.052 --> 15:11.162
We're trying to help you, big fat.

15:11.287 --> 15:12.864
I mean, yes, we want
your parking pass,

15:12.989 --> 15:15.000
but don't you want to
do anything with your life?

15:15.125 --> 15:16.416
This is what you call a life?

15:16.582 --> 15:17.970
Is this your legacy?

15:18.095 --> 15:20.606
Is this your Sistine chapel?

15:20.731 --> 15:22.775
Here lies Ders, the Telameridork,

15:22.900 --> 15:24.591
father of two broke gays.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.845
I saved a little girl's life, bro.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.388
I'm a hero.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.449
You are not a hero.
You're human mold

15:31.574 --> 15:32.682
in breakaway sweatpants.

15:32.848 --> 15:33.951
You're the kind of stain

15:34.076 --> 15:35.752
that makes Adam
throw out his underwear.

15:35.877 --> 15:38.155
Get him!
Wait, what?

15:38.280 --> 15:39.564
How 'bout I just take my parking pass

15:39.730 --> 15:41.274
and get on outta here?

15:41.440 --> 15:42.626
- Go.
- Okay, I'm going.

15:42.751 --> 15:44.068
- I can't take this.
- Hey, honey.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.361
You wanna roll with me,

15:45.527 --> 15:47.029
grab some lunch, rule the world?

15:47.195 --> 15:49.032
I'm sorry, I'm on
the phone... just one second.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.826
Fuck this. I'm outta here.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.037
All right.
[Grunting]

15:53.162 --> 15:54.972
Big fat, my man, chill out.

15:55.097 --> 15:57.374
We're all a little worked up,
probably from that fart.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.610
Dude, that was a barn burner!

15:59.735 --> 16:01.461
Hey, come on, let's
be feasible or whatever.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.679
Slow down.
Give us a few days, okay?

16:02.804 --> 16:04.114
We're gonna figure this out.

16:04.239 --> 16:05.424
We don't need to figure anything out.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.184
I'm gonna go
park the car on the street.

16:07.309 --> 16:08.318
We'll take the bus.

16:08.443 --> 16:09.761
Do our part.
Save the planet!

16:09.927 --> 16:12.489
Okay, I give up.
We need that pass

16:12.614 --> 16:13.990
because I cannot ride the bus.

16:14.115 --> 16:15.893
Homeless people wipe their hands
off in my hair.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.102
So once again, it is arithmetic, man.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.980
And if I'm being real,
I'm worried about you, man.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.691
What are you gonna do when
your disability runs out?

16:22.857 --> 16:25.359
- Huh?
- Really? You too?

16:25.525 --> 16:26.939
Hey, your cuz, he's right.

16:27.064 --> 16:28.274
That horrific accident you were in,

16:28.399 --> 16:29.809
that was lucky.

16:29.934 --> 16:32.345
And we can't make lightning
strike luck twice.

16:32.470 --> 16:33.660
We can't.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.620
Or can we?

16:35.786 --> 16:38.084
Make lightning do what Blake...

16:38.209 --> 16:40.541
Said it doesn't do.

16:40.707 --> 16:43.289
Workman's comp.
You get hurt at work,

16:43.414 --> 16:45.505
the checks don't stop.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.924
How do we even know
this is something that's real?

16:48.090 --> 16:49.361
Oh, come on, sad dads across America

16:49.486 --> 16:50.528
do it all the time.

16:50.653 --> 16:52.053
Probably one doing it right now.

16:52.219 --> 16:55.032
Guys, I'm just gonna think
about this.

16:55.157 --> 16:58.185
I didn't know a hero
could be such a big pussy.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.037
Suit me up.

17:00.162 --> 17:01.239
- Yes!
- All right!

17:01.364 --> 17:02.840
- Yeah!
- It's gonna be cool!

17:02.965 --> 17:06.858
That's what I'm
talking about, brother.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.881
- Ready?
- Throw!

17:09.006 --> 17:11.083
[Bleep]
[Grunting, groaning]

17:11.208 --> 17:12.852
[Bleep]

17:12.977 --> 17:14.117
[Chuckles]

17:14.282 --> 17:16.955
All: Whoa!

17:17.080 --> 17:19.157
You got some air!
You got some air!

17:19.282 --> 17:21.708
- Did you break anything?
- Nope.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.163
- Unh!
- Nothin'.

17:24.288 --> 17:27.213
- What?
- What are you doing, Devin?

17:27.378 --> 17:30.174
I... fell.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.238
No, we pushed him, okay?

17:32.363 --> 17:35.097
This guy wants to go back
to living in his basement,

17:35.263 --> 17:36.375
so we're giving him workman's comp

17:36.500 --> 17:37.974
in exchange for
a handicap parking pass.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.645
I wish somebody would have told me

17:39.770 --> 17:41.915
that I was working on Saturday,

17:42.040 --> 17:43.355
'cause this is just sad.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.753
All of this on the day
that would have been

17:46.878 --> 17:49.861
my cat Brent's 27th birthday
in human years.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.322
He never even got to ride
a roller coaster.

17:53.488 --> 17:55.116
Sorry about your cat,
but don't blame big fat.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.499
- [All beatboxing]
- Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

17:57.624 --> 17:59.996
You guys are just as sad.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.437
I... I shouldn't even say this,

18:01.562 --> 18:02.905
but I was coming in here to tell you

18:03.030 --> 18:04.774
- you're getting another ticket.
- What?

18:04.899 --> 18:07.420
I just moved it!

18:07.586 --> 18:09.312
Hey, we'll see you later, big dude.

18:09.437 --> 18:10.613
- Thanks anyways.
- Later.

18:10.738 --> 18:11.847
I'll come over in a few weeks,

18:11.972 --> 18:13.783
eat some tortas.
Tell Aunt Holly hi.

18:13.908 --> 18:16.052
This can't be happening.
I just want a fair shake!

18:16.177 --> 18:19.182
Can I just get a...
You!

18:19.348 --> 18:22.258
This is your fault.
I'm gonna rip your tits off

18:22.383 --> 18:24.770
and use 'em as cereal bowls!
You get me?

18:24.936 --> 18:29.359
[Audio slowed]
The cleaners!

18:35.698 --> 18:37.909
Holy [bleep]!

18:38.075 --> 18:40.478
- Are you okay? That was insane!
- That was a close call.

18:40.603 --> 18:43.206
- That was insane!
- Oh, we thought we lost you.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.709
I don't think
that's gonna happen, buddy.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.251
Oh, my God!
[Guys gasp]

18:47.417 --> 18:49.587
Who needs a leg
when all you wanna do is

18:49.712 --> 18:52.883
eat doritos
and watch Brazzers all day?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.884
- We did it!
- Yeah!

18:55.050 --> 18:57.261
- Oh, damn, we kinda did.
- Just... yeah.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.013
The city's gonna owe you millions.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.531
If not thousands.

19:00.656 --> 19:02.099
Hey, now, somebody tie something
around my leg

19:02.224 --> 19:04.568
before I croak out here,
you hand jobs!

19:04.693 --> 19:06.671
No, I got it. I gotcha.
I'll belt you up.

19:06.796 --> 19:09.316
Devin, I saw the whole thing
from the window.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.025
- Are you okay?
- Oh, Jillian, yeah.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.985
- I'll be fine.
- Good, 'cause look at me.

19:13.151 --> 19:15.571
We are definitely gonna have
our cats [bleep].

19:15.738 --> 19:17.148
You know, you don't want
to get mixed up

19:17.273 --> 19:18.849
with a guy like me.

19:18.974 --> 19:22.520
- I'm just a big ol' fat...
- Hero.

19:22.645 --> 19:24.955
You're a big ol' fat hero.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.224
I was wrong about you, man.
You deserve every cent

19:27.349 --> 19:29.794
- coming to you for this.
- No, bro.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.757
I was wrong about you.
You're not gay at all.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.508
You're probably bi, though.
[Laughter]

19:35.674 --> 19:37.235
- He's definitely bi.
- Oh, God!

19:37.360 --> 19:39.512
- That's cool.
- That's cheating, I feel.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.639
- [Humming beat]
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:41.865 --> 19:43.266
There it is.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.143
Ah, good movie.

19:45.268 --> 19:46.678
- That's a good movie.
- Great movie.

19:46.803 --> 19:48.980
Look at all these suckers
in regular parking.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.216
You're a bitch!
We're handicapped!

19:51.341 --> 19:53.693
Dude, your cousin big fat is the man!

19:53.943 --> 19:57.072
Yeah, us Demamps are
pretty raw dog as a people.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.458
Didn't like the guy at first,
but he came through.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.701
And here we ar...

20:07.039 --> 20:10.585
W-t [bleep]?

20:10.751 --> 20:13.272
Alice, I Demamp to know what you did

20:13.397 --> 20:16.091
with that bonus
handicap parking space. Hmm?

20:16.257 --> 20:19.145
- Why do you care?
- Come on, we are advocates

20:19.270 --> 20:20.746
for the <i>Handi-Captains,</i>

20:20.871 --> 20:22.471
and that's the one thing
you should know about us.

20:22.637 --> 20:23.807
You should know that about us.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.017
Look, you came in here the other day,

20:26.142 --> 20:27.352
said we didn't need it.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.521
I thought about it,
and you were right.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.223
- No. Alice.
- No.

20:31.348 --> 20:32.758
- What?
- We were right?

20:32.883 --> 20:35.260
Let's look at history.
We're never right.

20:35.385 --> 20:37.429
Does this guy...
Do I look right?

20:37.554 --> 20:39.072
Does this look right?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.766
Look, please just go back
to the phones, okay?

20:40.891 --> 20:42.450
I am not in the mood for this today.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.338
Apparently, some homeless people
broke into the old offices

20:45.463 --> 20:46.704
and destroyed everything.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.509
Homeless people.
Can't trust 'em.

20:49.634 --> 20:51.544
Know what I mean?
They're a foul, foul breed!

20:51.669 --> 20:54.087
- Thanks for, uh...
- Ecch! Gross!

Your honor, he have a witness

To the stand.
