00:18.066 --> 00:20.600
You're in Springwood now.

00:20.666 --> 00:22.533
And you're all mine!

01:30.866 --> 01:35.400
Oh great spirit
of William Murdoch..

01:35.466 --> 01:39.933
...first mate
of the great ship Titanic.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.933
Are you there?

01:44.500 --> 01:46.433
William Murdoch.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.100
If you are there, I invite you..

01:51.166 --> 01:54.133
...to use my earthly body..

01:54.200 --> 01:58.466
...my vocal chords,
my very soul as your channel

01:58.533 --> 02:01.533
to the world of the living.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.533
Speak to us.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.300
Speak to us.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.300
Spe-ak!

02:15.666 --> 02:17.600
I am here!

02:19.266 --> 02:23.433
William Murdoch, first mate
reporting for duty.

02:25.533 --> 02:26.866
Oh, my God!

02:26.933 --> 02:29.066
Look! Dead ahead!

02:29.133 --> 02:30.900
A huge iceberg!

02:30.966 --> 02:34.300
Oh! Engines full stop!

02:35.033 --> 02:36.166
My God!

02:36.233 --> 02:37.900
It's too late!

02:37.966 --> 02:39.700
Oh!

02:39.766 --> 02:42.000
All engines, full reverse!

02:42.066 --> 02:44.133
- Ah!
- 'Is she alright?'

02:45.966 --> 02:48.366
We're taking on water!

02:48.433 --> 02:50.900
We should have seen it coming!

02:50.966 --> 02:53.733
Wasn't anyone
watching the sonar?

02:53.800 --> 02:54.833
'Fraud!'

02:54.900 --> 02:58.066
Sonar wasn't invented
when the Titanic sailed!

02:58.133 --> 02:59.366
Ladies and gentlemen.

02:59.433 --> 03:02.200
I am Dr. Harry Lee,
professional skeptic.

03:02.266 --> 03:06.300
Ms. Mara Ruleen has just
proven herself a fraud!

03:06.366 --> 03:08.833
I feel myself drifting!

03:08.900 --> 03:11.366
Drifting..

03:12.600 --> 03:16.600
Sonar wasn't invented
when the Titanic sailed!

03:16.666 --> 03:20.200
- Fake! Fake!
- Refund!

03:20.266 --> 03:22.333
'Fake! Fake!'

03:48.933 --> 03:51.033
That chick
shouldn't mess with the dead.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.233
Take it from me. I'm dead.

03:54.833 --> 03:55.900
Hey.

03:55.966 --> 03:58.266
Maybe she could channel me.

04:09.066 --> 04:10.633
- You Mara Ruleen?
- Yes.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.366
- Who are you?
- Oliver Michaels.

04:12.433 --> 04:13.766
Hey, racky-rock!

04:13.833 --> 04:15.600
Uh, it's a touchstone.

04:15.666 --> 04:17.033
Listen, am I supposed
to know who you are?

04:17.100 --> 04:19.200
Uh-uh. Nope.

04:19.266 --> 04:21.700
Uh, then what do you want?

04:21.766 --> 04:23.966
Whoa. This sucker's heavy.

04:24.033 --> 04:25.833
What do you want?

04:25.900 --> 04:27.866
Well, I hear you're looking
for a new assistant.

04:27.933 --> 04:30.033
Look no further! I'm your man!

04:31.100 --> 04:32.533
You know..

04:32.600 --> 04:34.833
...your aura's real yellow.

04:35.933 --> 04:37.133
You read auras?

04:37.200 --> 04:38.166
That's my thing.

04:38.233 --> 04:40.866
That...and crystals.

04:40.933 --> 04:43.233
Wait. Did Harry Lee send you?

04:43.300 --> 04:45.466
- Harry who?
- Harry Lee!

04:45.533 --> 04:47.400
The slime ball
who spent the last year

04:47.466 --> 04:48.933
trying to ruin my career.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.433
Don't know him.

04:52.266 --> 04:54.000
Do you believe
a person can be a conduit

04:54.066 --> 04:57.366
through which the dead
can talk to the living?

04:57.433 --> 04:59.766
Listen, lady, I just need a job.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.600
I had this hot gig
with this lady photographer.

05:01.666 --> 05:05.133
It was great! Sexy babes
around all the time!

05:05.200 --> 05:07.166
Then she went blind
and my job went south.

05:07.233 --> 05:08.933
Just answer the question.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.700
Do you believe in channeling?

05:10.766 --> 05:12.700
I'll believe anything
if you pay me enough.

05:16.266 --> 05:18.200
I like your style.

05:20.066 --> 05:21.866
Ten dollars an hour enough?

05:21.933 --> 05:23.233
Racky! When do I start?

05:23.300 --> 05:24.733
Right now.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.333
Your job's very important, kid.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.666
You've got three
main responsibilities.

05:40.733 --> 05:42.933
Now, first and
most important, when I..

05:44.333 --> 05:45.833
'Watch this, man.'

05:48.033 --> 05:49.900
Ow!

05:49.966 --> 05:51.066
Hey. You listenin' to me?

05:51.133 --> 05:52.700
Yeah, yeah, I got
three responsibilities.

05:52.766 --> 05:55.200
Now, first and most important.

05:55.266 --> 05:58.700
When I'm on that stage,
although the channeling is fake

05:58.766 --> 06:01.333
the trance is real.
Helps me concentrate.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.866
Cool. What do you use, some kind
of transcendental trance?

06:04.933 --> 06:07.800
Well, something like that,
it's a very deep trance

06:07.866 --> 06:09.900
and it helps me
avoid stage fright.

06:09.966 --> 06:11.533
So where do I come in?

06:11.600 --> 06:12.566
You watch my back.

06:12.633 --> 06:13.633
Make sure none of those crazies

06:13.700 --> 06:14.800
jump on that stage with me

06:14.866 --> 06:16.166
Sort of a bouncer kind of thing.

06:16.233 --> 06:18.033
- Exactly.
- Ah.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.766
Hey, I recognize her.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.066
'Great set of pyramids.'

06:21.133 --> 06:22.333
Pay attention.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.900
Now your other two jobs
are taking the money at the door

06:24.966 --> 06:26.600
and watching the crowd.

06:26.666 --> 06:28.700
- What for?
- You look for suckers.

06:28.766 --> 06:31.166
You know, anybody who migh
be falling for my act

06:31.233 --> 06:32.700
hook, line, and sinker.

06:32.766 --> 06:33.900
You know, anybody
who might wanna pay

06:33.966 --> 06:35.900
big bucks
for a personal session.

06:35.966 --> 06:38.266
They usually look like this.

06:41.066 --> 06:42.633
Hey, you owe me
a hundred bucks, Ruleen!

06:42.700 --> 06:45.400
Oh, Barry Dean. How you doing?

06:45.466 --> 06:47.733
Oh, I'll be doing great as soon
as you pay that $100 you owe me.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.700
Oh, how do you know
I didn't win the bet?

06:49.766 --> 06:53.133
Well, can you top
$15,000 in three hours?

06:53.200 --> 06:55.433
Fifteen thousand in three hours?

06:55.500 --> 06:56.733
Yeah, you're gonna love this!

06:56.800 --> 06:58.133
Can I talk in front of, um..

06:58.200 --> 07:00.666
Oh, yeah, Barry Dean,
this is Oliver, he works for me.

07:00.733 --> 07:04.233
Oliver, meet one of my bes
friends and worst enemies.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.366
- How you doing?
- Barry Dean.

07:05.433 --> 07:07.066
Ha ha! Alright, now
you're gonna love this!

07:07.133 --> 07:09.433
So last week, this rich, old
Hollywood producer comes to me

07:09.500 --> 07:11.433
convinced that
his mansion is haunted

07:11.500 --> 07:12.533
by one of the Three Stooges.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.966
No!

07:14.033 --> 07:16.366
So I convinced him he had
the other two stooges, too.

07:16.433 --> 07:17.900
- You're kidding!
- 'Yeah!'

07:19.600 --> 07:21.733
At 5000 a spook..

07:21.800 --> 07:23.533
...I made 15 grand
in three hours.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.266
Read it and weep,

07:26.433 --> 07:28.266
Okay, you win.

07:28.333 --> 07:30.233
I'll pay you later.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.533
Oh, uh, listen.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.900
Has Harry Lee been around?

07:32.966 --> 07:34.266
I go on about an hour.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.833
No, but I'll keep
my eyes out for him.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.100
Oh, thanks.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.533
Come on, kid.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.066
What was that bet all about?

07:41.133 --> 07:43.333
Oh, we had a bet as to
who could make the most money

07:43.400 --> 07:46.033
from one sucker
at one time before the New Year.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.000
Really? What's the most
you ever made?

07:48.066 --> 07:49.300
Ten grand.

07:49.366 --> 07:52.166
Ah, but I've got a feeling
my luck's gonna change.

07:52.233 --> 07:54.233
Yeah, I think you've got
a good eye for suckers.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.700
Pick me out a juicy one.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.900
Oh, now, stay here. The crowd's
gonna be coming in any time.

08:08.266 --> 08:12.300
Oh, great spirit
of William Murdoch..

08:12.366 --> 08:15.966
...first mate
on the great ship Titanic.

08:16.033 --> 08:18.000
Are you there?

08:19.733 --> 08:21.633
William Murdoch..

08:21.700 --> 08:25.900
...if you are there I invite you
to use my earthly body.

08:25.966 --> 08:28.233
'My vocal chords.'

08:28.300 --> 08:30.666
'My soul!'

08:30.733 --> 08:33.433
'As your channel
to the world of the living..'

08:34.233 --> 08:36.600
...speak to us.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.433
Speak to...ugh!

08:43.800 --> 08:47.633
Don't mind if I do, ba-a-abe!

08:49.966 --> 08:52.600
Who's there?

08:52.666 --> 08:56.033
It ain't Mickey Mouse!

09:03.500 --> 09:06.133
Mara, snap out of it!
Mara, snap out of it!

09:08.600 --> 09:11.633
Don't get all red
in the face, boys!

09:15.266 --> 09:17.300
What's everyone staring at?

09:17.366 --> 09:19.333
Let's party!

09:23.933 --> 09:25.433
Are you sure you're okay?

09:25.500 --> 09:27.066
Yes. Now leave me alone.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.700
- Can we get you anything?
- No.

09:28.766 --> 09:30.466
Water?
Something to help you sleep?

09:30.533 --> 09:32.500
No! Just go away!

09:33.966 --> 09:36.200
Hey, I don't mind tellin' ya.

09:36.266 --> 09:39.733
That was the best performance
you've ever given.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.800
How'd you do
that thing to your voice

09:40.866 --> 09:42.933
to make it sound so ugly?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.233
Like this!

09:44.300 --> 09:46.533
Now, scat!

09:48.933 --> 09:50.900
I wonder what's gotten into her.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.633
Where am I?

10:24.700 --> 10:27.300
You're in a trance, doll face.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.466
Oh! What do you mean,
I'm in a trance?

10:31.533 --> 10:33.133
I'm wide awake!

10:33.200 --> 10:35.033
I'm right here in this, this..

10:35.100 --> 10:37.033
Trance.

10:38.100 --> 10:39.466
Who are you?

10:39.533 --> 10:41.233
Well, you said
you need a dead person

10:41.300 --> 10:43.133
that you could talk through.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.733
I'm your guy.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.733
I don't understand.

10:49.266 --> 10:50.900
Your body..

10:50.966 --> 10:53.266
...is my body, babe.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.933
And what a body it is!

11:06.600 --> 11:07.933
Red.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.933
Very...red.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.833
Uh, sorry.
I just didn't, you were..

11:11.900 --> 11:13.966
Uh, may I help you?

11:14.033 --> 11:15.266
Now, that's red.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.800
Definitely red.

11:16.866 --> 11:17.800
Excuse me?

11:17.866 --> 11:19.800
Your aura. Very red.

11:19.866 --> 11:22.166
- So is your face, pal.
- Thank you!

11:22.233 --> 11:24.366
Would you like to know
about my pyramids?

11:24.433 --> 11:25.833
Yes.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.266
- Very much.
- Okay.

11:28.333 --> 11:30.333
They're a natural source
of aura energy--

11:30.400 --> 11:32.100
Don't I know you from somewhere?

11:32.166 --> 11:33.800
I doubt it.

11:33.866 --> 11:36.366
Yeah, you posed
for Stony Adler once!

11:36.433 --> 11:38.366
- How did you know that?
- I was her assistant.

11:38.433 --> 11:39.666
Oh, yeah.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.733
You were that jerk
that kept hitting on me.

11:41.800 --> 11:42.933
That's me!

11:43.000 --> 11:44.600
So. You still modeling?

11:44.666 --> 11:46.666
No. After my, uh..

11:46.733 --> 11:48.700
...experience with
that weirdo photographer

11:48.766 --> 11:50.700
I swore it off.

11:50.766 --> 11:54.466
Uh, would you like to
know about my pyramids, sir?

11:54.533 --> 11:56.066
Actually, I was wondering

11:56.133 --> 11:59.033
if you could direct me
to a good trans-channeler.

11:59.100 --> 12:02.300
I need to contact my dead father
as soon as possible.

12:02.366 --> 12:03.700
I know a good channeler.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.133
- Who is it?
- It's Mara Ruleen.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.233
But I don't know if she wants
to be bothered right now.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.966
Uh, who are you?

12:10.033 --> 12:12.100
I'm her assistant.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.566
You're Mara Ruleen's assistant?

12:14.633 --> 12:16.100
Where can I find her?

12:16.166 --> 12:17.733
I'll pay anything!

12:17.800 --> 12:19.400
- Anything?
- Hmm.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.966
She's in room 243. Go on up.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.566
And be sure to tell her
what you just told me.

12:24.633 --> 12:27.400
Especially the part
about paying her anything.

12:27.466 --> 12:28.733
Thank you!

12:29.900 --> 12:31.033
Uh!

12:31.100 --> 12:32.600
Be sure you tell her
Oliver sent you.

12:32.666 --> 12:34.400
Mm.

12:34.466 --> 12:36.400
Oliver? Uh, sweetheart.

12:36.466 --> 12:39.000
Would you watch
my booth till I get back?

12:39.066 --> 12:40.633
- Sure.
- Thanks.

12:47.066 --> 12:48.466
What did you tell
that guy just now?

12:48.533 --> 12:50.233
I just told him
where he could find Mara.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.900
He's got big bucks,
I could smell it.

12:51.966 --> 12:55.400
You idiot!
That is Harry Lee! Come on

12:57.066 --> 13:00.266
Couldn't have picked
a better body to live in.

13:00.333 --> 13:03.833
Bet you're
a real man-killer, huh.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.800
Hey!

13:05.866 --> 13:08.733
Put my clothes back on!

13:08.800 --> 13:12.400
You perverted, ugly, mean..
Hey!

13:12.466 --> 13:14.066
'Ms. Ruleen?'

13:14.133 --> 13:16.200
'It's Harry Lee.'

13:16.266 --> 13:18.966
What do you say
we kill us a man?

13:26.100 --> 13:28.066
Say something!

13:28.133 --> 13:31.066
When are you gonna
let me go, you bastard?

13:31.133 --> 13:33.966
When are you gonna
let me go, you bastard?

13:34.033 --> 13:35.766
Put my clothes back on!

13:35.833 --> 13:38.266
Put my clothes back on!

13:38.333 --> 13:40.500
Rich Little, eat your heart out.

13:55.266 --> 13:56.866
Ms. Ruleen! I, uh..

13:56.933 --> 13:58.466
...oh, I-I didn't mean to, uh--

13:58.533 --> 14:01.400
Hello, uh, uh, old friend.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.100
How are you? Come in.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.433
Sit.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.266
Help, Harry!

14:07.333 --> 14:10.266
Harry! Harry!

14:10.333 --> 14:12.333
Shut up, bitch!

14:12.400 --> 14:14.366
He can't hear you.

14:14.433 --> 14:16.166
I beg your pardon.

14:16.233 --> 14:19.266
Uh, nothing,
just talking to myself.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.800
Sit.

14:21.866 --> 14:23.433
Si-i-t.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.300
Ms. Ruleen, I hope
you don't mind my interrupting.

14:33.366 --> 14:34.900
Uh, my name's Jodi.

14:34.966 --> 14:36.366
I've wanted to meet you
ever since--

14:36.433 --> 14:38.833
We have met, bimbo.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.033
I beg your pardon?

14:41.266 --> 14:42.600
'We could've danced all night.'

14:42.666 --> 14:44.500
Where do I know
that voice from?

14:44.566 --> 14:46.866
That weirdo
at the photography shoot.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.666
Uh, I-I'm sorry I interrupted.

14:48.733 --> 14:51.733
- I--
- Don't be silly, come on in.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.933
Excuse us, we women
have to powder our noses.

14:58.366 --> 15:00.266
What happened to your voice?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.333
Nothing. Why?

15:02.400 --> 15:05.466
Uh, wh-what do you want from me?

15:05.533 --> 15:07.366
Just to look at you.

15:07.433 --> 15:10.166
Such a pretty face.

15:10.233 --> 15:13.766
Now, listen, I don't go
for that kind of stuff.

15:13.833 --> 15:15.700
What kind of stuff?

15:15.766 --> 15:17.366
I-I mean, I think
you're pretty and all

15:17.433 --> 15:20.366
but I like men, not women.

15:20.433 --> 15:22.833
You're a real head-turner, babe.

15:24.366 --> 15:25.433
No!

15:25.500 --> 15:27.233
'Yeah!'

15:27.300 --> 15:28.800
You killed her.

15:30.566 --> 15:32.200
'Wasn't that fun?'

15:32.266 --> 15:35.566
'What do you say
we do it again?'

15:35.633 --> 15:38.100
No! Please, no!

15:40.800 --> 15:43.766
Now, how 'bout a drink?

15:43.833 --> 15:46.900
Oh-h. Now that would be nice.

15:46.966 --> 15:50.033
- Name your poison.
- How about a bloody Mary?

15:50.100 --> 15:52.300
Hmm, I'll see
if I've got that.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.533
Oh, sorry.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.966
I can't make you a bloody Mary.

16:00.033 --> 16:03.566
How about I make you
a bloody Harry?

16:13.866 --> 16:15.333
No!

16:15.400 --> 16:17.400
'Yes!'

16:26.766 --> 16:28.300
Huh?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.200
Come on in, boys.

16:35.266 --> 16:37.233
The more the merrier.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.933
Let me go!

16:44.000 --> 16:46.233
You murderer!

16:46.300 --> 16:48.233
Call me crazy
but it looks to me

16:48.300 --> 16:50.233
like you're
the murderer, babe.

16:51.266 --> 16:54.433
You're right.
They'll think I did it.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.366
I'll get the death sentence
for this.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.533
Ah, don't worry. Maybe
some weirdo can channel you.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.366
Uh, let me go!

17:02.433 --> 17:05.200
Not a chance,
I'm having too much fun.

17:05.266 --> 17:07.833
Fun? You call killing fun?

17:07.900 --> 17:10.133
Who were you
when you were alive?

17:10.200 --> 17:11.966
An axe murderer?

17:12.033 --> 17:13.433
You're gettin' warm.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.400
Uh, you're insane.

17:15.466 --> 17:18.566
I know, isn't it great?

17:18.633 --> 17:20.600
This is all an act, right?

17:20.666 --> 17:23.400
Hello, Barry.

17:23.466 --> 17:25.633
I mean, uh, hello, Barry.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.666
Oliver.
Oh, well, come on in.

17:28.733 --> 17:31.800
Oh, close the door!

17:35.133 --> 17:37.800
Oh, uh, don't mind him.
He's dead.

17:37.866 --> 17:41.700
Uh, I mean, uh,
he-he killed himself.

17:41.766 --> 17:43.200
Yeah-yeah that's right.

17:43.266 --> 17:44.533
Oh, yeah, the-the poor man

17:44.600 --> 17:47.166
he-he just killed himself!

17:47.233 --> 17:50.700
- I see.
- You don't believe me.

17:50.766 --> 17:52.800
Oh, no, of course I believe you.

17:52.866 --> 17:54.566
This is an act, right?
That's fake blood?

17:54.633 --> 17:56.100
I don't think so.
I've seen this once before.

17:56.166 --> 17:57.366
She's stuck
in some kind of trance.

17:57.433 --> 17:58.500
What does that mean?

17:58.566 --> 17:59.566
It means she might
really have some kind of

17:59.633 --> 18:01.100
weird spirit using her body.

18:01.166 --> 18:02.366
We have to get her
out of this trance.

18:02.433 --> 18:03.666
So how do we do that?

18:03.733 --> 18:04.900
You ever see "The Exorcist?"

18:04.966 --> 18:06.966
- Yeah, ten times.
- Good.

18:07.033 --> 18:09.700
Good. We're about to perform
an exorcism.

18:09.766 --> 18:10.900
- We're not priests.
- We don't have to be.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.166
There's only one thing
that can motivate her

18:12.233 --> 18:14.866
out of this trance
and it sure ain't religion

18:14.933 --> 18:16.533
Then what is it?

18:18.166 --> 18:20.033
- Power of money compels you.
- Power of money compels you.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.666
The power of money compels you.

18:22.733 --> 18:24.833
'The power of money
compels you.'

18:24.900 --> 18:27.100
'The power of money
compels you.'

18:27.166 --> 18:29.333
The power of money compels you.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.066
The power of money compels you.

18:32.133 --> 18:34.500
'The power of money
compels you.'

18:34.566 --> 18:36.800
'The power of money
compels you.'

18:36.866 --> 18:39.566
The power of money compels you.

18:39.633 --> 18:42.433
The power of money compels you.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.866
'The power of money
compels you.'

18:44.933 --> 18:47.000
'The power of..'

18:47.066 --> 18:50.433
Barry, uh, huh, Oliver!
Is that you?

18:50.500 --> 18:52.700
Mara.

18:52.766 --> 18:54.066
Mara.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.100
Are you alright?

18:55.166 --> 18:57.966
Oh, uh, the last thing
I remember

18:58.033 --> 19:00.833
I, I was on stage..

19:00.900 --> 19:03.300
...trying to channel
that guy from the Titanic

19:07.700 --> 19:09.000
Suckers!

19:11.633 --> 19:14.100
Hey! Those are my friends!

19:15.833 --> 19:19.533
Aw, gee, really, I didn't know.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.333
You shoulda killed 'em.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.600
Your breath stinks about as bad
as your personality.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.600
Listen up, bitch.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.800
The only reason
you're still alive

19:29.866 --> 19:32.300
is because I need your body.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.700
I don't think this
mumbo jumbo's working.

19:37.766 --> 19:39.333
Yeah, we're gonna
have to do something else.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.333
Like what?

19:40.400 --> 19:41.400
Well, maybe we gotta fight

19:41.466 --> 19:42.500
this guy in his own turf.

19:42.566 --> 19:43.500
What does that mean?

19:43.566 --> 19:45.233
It means, we're gonna have to

19:45.300 --> 19:46.866
go into a trance ourselves.

19:46.933 --> 19:48.666
Grab her hand.

19:48.733 --> 19:49.933
That one.

19:51.833 --> 19:53.333
Alright.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.333
Now, do what I do.

20:29.666 --> 20:32.033
It worked.

20:32.100 --> 20:35.100
Barry, it worked!
I'm free.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.800
No, you're not.

20:40.666 --> 20:42.600
You're dead, bitch!

20:58.733 --> 21:00.800
Where the hell am I?

21:00.866 --> 21:03.233
What's the matter
with your body, huh?

21:03.300 --> 21:04.766
Got a tummy ache?

21:04.833 --> 21:07.000
Uh, I've got a bleeding ulcer.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.566
I'll show you bleeding!

21:09.633 --> 21:10.566
No!

21:41.500 --> 21:43.433
I do not have
a good feeling about this.

21:45.466 --> 21:47.700
Definite bad karma action
in this room.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.433
Too much negative energy.

21:51.300 --> 21:53.333
Negative energy.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.166
Uh, I've never been negative

21:56.233 --> 21:58.300
a day in my life.

21:58.833 --> 22:01.000
Trust me.

22:23.366 --> 22:25.633
Aren't you glad
that you decided

22:25.700 --> 22:28.800
to come to the reunion?

22:28.866 --> 22:31.100
I never thought
our paths would cross agai

22:31.166 --> 22:34.166
let alone collide
like they did last night.

22:34.233 --> 22:36.900
You are, uh, definitely no

22:36.966 --> 22:40.833
the same Denise Charlotte
I know back in high school

22:40.900 --> 22:43.066
Oh, you mean I'm not
a carpenter's dream anymore?

22:43.133 --> 22:45.066
Isn't that
what you used to call me?

22:45.133 --> 22:47.333
That wasn't me, that was, um

22:47.400 --> 22:49.400
Ricky Contaldo.

22:49.466 --> 22:50.800
I always said
you were very cute.

22:50.866 --> 22:52.833
Yeah, right,
forget it, Larry.

22:52.900 --> 22:54.033
I think we've both
come a long way

22:54.100 --> 22:56.033
since we left Springwood High.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.133
Aren't you gonna come in?

23:12.200 --> 23:15.766
No offense, mister, but there's
some bad energy in this room.

23:15.833 --> 23:17.533
Bad energy?
What are you talking about?

23:17.600 --> 23:20.400
I gotta split,
just take your food.

23:22.733 --> 23:24.700
Mm, smells good.
What did you order?

23:44.366 --> 23:46.433
Denise, you okay?

23:47.666 --> 23:48.933
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:50.566 --> 23:52.366
What?

23:52.433 --> 23:55.066
What, you having a-a bad dream?

23:55.133 --> 23:57.733
I dreamt that you ordered
dead rats from room service.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.866
Oh, that couldn't have been me.

23:59.933 --> 24:01.666
I never order rats,
especially in a hotel.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.733
They come dry, overcooked.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.633
It's not funny.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.233
You know I used to have
scary dreams all the time

24:07.300 --> 24:10.333
when I was growing up but they
stopped when I left Springwood.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.166
Now, I'm back
and so are the nightmares.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.466
Hey, come on.

24:13.533 --> 24:15.733
Everybody has nightmares.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.166
You're probably just nervous
about seeing

24:17.233 --> 24:18.300
all your old friends.

24:18.366 --> 24:19.300
I don't think
it's something you need to

24:19.366 --> 24:21.400
worry about that much.

24:21.466 --> 24:24.233
Besides, you've got me her
to protect you.

24:24.300 --> 24:25.900
And believe me..

24:25.966 --> 24:29.300
...you are in very good hands.

24:33.066 --> 24:36.566
Let's hear it
for the old Springwood High.

24:36.633 --> 24:38.733
Sure has changed

24:38.800 --> 24:41.333
since I walked down them
hallowed halls.

24:42.833 --> 24:45.200
It used be
kids just dropped out.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.500
Now they..

24:47.566 --> 24:48.566
...drop dead.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.966
'Look, Larry, what are you
trying to do to me here, huh?'

24:58.033 --> 25:00.233
'Come on, I got a deadline,
a deadline you were supposed--'

25:00.300 --> 25:02.533
Leo, would you calm down?

25:02.600 --> 25:04.500
You're gonna give yourself
another heart attack.

25:04.566 --> 25:06.600
Look, I told you
I was going out of town.

25:06.666 --> 25:08.166
It's my 20 year reunion.

25:08.233 --> 25:09.800
- 'Right, but you promised me--'
- Yeah, I know.

25:09.866 --> 25:11.433
I promised you
the script before I left.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.533
'Yeah, so where is it?'

25:12.600 --> 25:16.166
- I lied.
- 'You lied? What? You're not..'

25:16.233 --> 25:17.500
That was a joke, Leo.

25:17.566 --> 25:19.433
Look, all I need
is a few more days.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.800
I brought my typewriter with me.

25:20.866 --> 25:22.566
I'm writing even as we speak.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.900
'But is it any good?'

25:25.966 --> 25:27.133
Is it good?

25:27.200 --> 25:29.300
It's a masterpiece!

25:29.366 --> 25:31.933
Leo, your three stooges
still haunting you?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.466
'Yeah, very funny! Very funny!'

25:33.533 --> 25:36.400
You're beautiful, Leo,
now leave me alone!

25:45.600 --> 25:47.766
- Morning!
- Good morning.

25:47.833 --> 25:49.800
Denise, no more nightmares
I hope.

25:49.866 --> 25:51.400
God, that was weird,
wasn't it?

25:51.466 --> 25:52.900
So, what are you doin'?

25:52.966 --> 25:55.300
Writing my next movie
or, uh, trying to.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.633
You wanna eat your breakfast
before it gets cold.

26:04.900 --> 26:06.800
It's plastic.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.533
I-I'm sorry, Denise,
I couldn't resist.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.433
I bought it for my cat
at the airport.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.066
You think that's funny?
That's sick.

26:15.133 --> 26:18.733
Well, come on.
Denise, it was a joke!

26:18.800 --> 26:20.800
Where's your sense of humor?

26:26.133 --> 26:27.833
Got any ideas
for a screenplay?

26:29.966 --> 26:30.900
'Watch your end.'

26:45.133 --> 26:46.433
Cindy!

26:46.500 --> 26:47.633
Yes?

26:47.700 --> 26:49.366
Howard Nehamkin.

26:49.433 --> 26:52.800
I-I wrote that I'd be coming
early to help you set up.

26:52.866 --> 26:55.333
Of course, Howard!

26:55.400 --> 26:57.633
You haven't changed a bit.

26:57.700 --> 27:00.566
You either.

27:00.633 --> 27:01.600
Bless you.

27:01.666 --> 27:03.333
Um..

27:03.400 --> 27:05.300
Uh, you know,
I'd been thinking

27:05.366 --> 27:07.400
I haven't checked lately
to see if there were

27:07.466 --> 27:09.900
any last minute RSVPs.

27:09.966 --> 27:11.500
Do you know
where the hotel mailroom is?

27:11.566 --> 27:12.966
Um, I could easily find out.

27:13.033 --> 27:15.933
Oh, bless you, Howard, I don't
know what I'd do without you.

27:23.333 --> 27:24.733
'Denise Charlotte!'

27:24.800 --> 27:27.100
Oh, hello! How are you?

27:27.166 --> 27:29.933
Oh, my, heavenly days. You
still look like a cheerleader.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.300
Oh, well,
I wouldn't go that far!

27:31.366 --> 27:33.600
Oh, uh, you-you
remember John Johnson?

27:33.666 --> 27:34.666
'Hi, Denise.'

27:34.733 --> 27:35.733
And Mary.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.366
Um, Mary Butler.

27:37.433 --> 27:41.300
Mary Johnson, we've been married
for 17 wonderful years.

27:41.366 --> 27:43.233
Well, isn't that wonderful!

27:43.300 --> 27:44.466
'You staying in town long?'

27:44.533 --> 27:45.666
We'd love to have you
come to the house

27:45.733 --> 27:46.900
and meet our daughter Debbie.

27:46.966 --> 27:49.933
Oh, she's nine years old
and cute as a button.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.100
I'm sure she is, but I'm afraid
I'm gonna be leaving

27:52.166 --> 27:53.233
right after the reunion.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.233
- Oh!
- Oh, that's a shame.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.466
Well, come on, dear,
we better get busy.

27:56.533 --> 27:58.200
We still have
all those doilies to pull.

27:58.266 --> 28:00.300
See you later, Denise.

28:00.933 --> 28:02.933
Uh, Cindy

28:03.000 --> 28:04.266
can I ask you a question?

28:04.333 --> 28:06.833
How many people
are coming to this reunion

28:06.900 --> 28:10.133
At last count, 19.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.766
Unless, of course,
they let the Johnsons

28:11.833 --> 28:13.366
bring that little brat
of theirs.

28:13.433 --> 28:15.766
Nineteen people
out of a class of 300?

28:15.833 --> 28:17.800
Why such a low turnout?

28:17.866 --> 28:19.833
Well, one reason
could be the fact

28:19.900 --> 28:23.400
that nearly half of
our former classmates are dead.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.600
You're kidding. How?

28:25.666 --> 28:27.933
Was there a plane crash
or some kinda disaster?

28:28.000 --> 28:31.666
No, just a lot of
people dying, I guess.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.266
Who is that?
Did he graduate with us?

28:37.333 --> 28:39.033
Don't you remember Howard?

28:39.100 --> 28:41.633
- Howard Nehamkin.
- No.

28:41.700 --> 28:45.333
Oh, he was such a dweeb, you
probably never talked to him.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.500
Oh, wait a minute,
he used to hang out

28:46.566 --> 28:48.233
with Freddy Krueger,
didn't he?

28:48.300 --> 28:49.833
Uh-huh.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.200
This just came in the mail

28:51.266 --> 28:53.566
Oh, thank you, Howard,
let's see who it's from.

28:53.633 --> 28:55.500
Hello, Denise.

28:55.566 --> 28:57.166
You look well.

28:57.233 --> 28:59.533
And so do you...Howard.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.033
Oh, I try to stay in shape

29:02.100 --> 29:04.700
- I-is this your idea of a joke?
- What do you mean?

29:04.766 --> 29:06.200
Freddy Krueger will attend

29:06.266 --> 29:09.100
the Springwood High
20 year reunion.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.700
I-I didn't send it.

29:10.766 --> 29:13.366
Gee, whatever happened
to Freddy Krueger?

29:13.433 --> 29:16.733
Well, if you want to hear
about Freddy Krueger

29:17.700 --> 29:20.000
you'd better have a seat.

29:31.433 --> 29:33.000
Oh, this is..

29:47.400 --> 29:49.600
You wanna save
some of that for me?

29:49.666 --> 29:51.600
I'm gonna need it.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.400
'You alright?'

29:55.000 --> 29:56.500
No, I am not.

29:56.566 --> 29:59.366
What's the matter,
what happened?

29:59.433 --> 30:01.633
Do you remember a boy named
Freddy Krueger?

30:01.700 --> 30:04.866
Vaguely. He was kinda strange
wasn't he? He kept to himself.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.033
Hey, he was the guy who wore

30:06.100 --> 30:07.666
that red and green sweater
everyday, right?

30:07.733 --> 30:09.866
What about him?

30:09.933 --> 30:13.266
He molested and murdered
over a dozen small children.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.266
What?

30:14.333 --> 30:15.266
Cindy Schibe just told me

30:15.333 --> 30:17.733
the whole gruesome story.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.633
A group of angry parents
finally caught up with him

30:19.700 --> 30:20.800
and they..

30:20.866 --> 30:22.866
...they burned him alive.

30:22.933 --> 30:25.000
I knew he was weird,
I didn't know he was that weird.

30:25.066 --> 30:27.066
Oh, there's more.

30:27.133 --> 30:29.933
Cindy says that some people feel
that he's still alive.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.500
Well-well-well,
sort of that he..

30:32.566 --> 30:34.833
...comes back
to get even with people.

30:34.900 --> 30:35.866
In their dreams.

30:35.933 --> 30:38.100
In their dreams?
Gimme a break--

30:38.166 --> 30:40.466
I know-I know, I know
it sounds far-fetched

30:40.533 --> 30:42.466
but Cindy knew someone
that had a dream about Freddy

30:42.533 --> 30:45.066
and the next day she died,
just like that.

30:45.133 --> 30:46.833
Now, practically everyone
that knew Freddy Krueger

30:46.900 --> 30:50.266
is either dead or they're gone
from Springwood for good.

30:50.333 --> 30:52.966
Okay, assuming this fairytale
has some basis in fact

30:53.033 --> 30:55.066
which I seriously doubt,
I mean, I don't see

30:55.133 --> 30:56.600
'why you are so worked up.'

30:56.666 --> 30:58.166
'I don't remember
you having anything'

30:58.233 --> 31:00.066
'to do with Freddy Krueger.'

31:00.133 --> 31:02.066
Wrong.

31:02.133 --> 31:05.233
He asked me to go to
the senior prom with him.

31:05.300 --> 31:07.200
I couldn't believe it, he'd
never said more than two words

31:07.266 --> 31:09.066
to me before that.

31:09.133 --> 31:10.566
'And I don't know why I did it'

31:10.633 --> 31:13.733
but the next day, I let Cindy
talk me into saying yes.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.033
And, of course,
I had no intension of actually

31:15.100 --> 31:17.166
going to the dance with him.

31:17.233 --> 31:18.666
We just wanted to see
the look on his face

31:18.733 --> 31:21.133
when he rang the doorbell
and no one answered.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.900
Cindy and I were watching
from my bedroom window

31:22.966 --> 31:25.366
we laughed our heads off.
God, we were cruel.

31:25.433 --> 31:28.633
Denise, will you stop
being so hard on yourself?

31:28.700 --> 31:30.900
Look, if Freddy Krueger
wants to get to you

31:30.966 --> 31:33.633
he's gonna have to
come through me first.

31:33.700 --> 31:36.433
Oh, that makes me
feel real secure.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.166
I'm gonna go lay down
and try to get some rest.

31:38.233 --> 31:41.133
Good idea, we've got some
serious partying to do tonight.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.066
Who is it?

31:53.133 --> 31:54.633
'Howard Nehamkin.'

31:55.766 --> 31:57.033
- Who?
- 'Um.'

31:57.100 --> 31:59.100
'We took woodshop together.'

32:02.666 --> 32:04.733
Long time, no see.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.600
Yeah. How you doin'?

32:07.666 --> 32:08.966
What did you say
your name was again?

32:09.033 --> 32:11.133
Howard. Howard Nehamkin.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.233
- Yeah.
- Oh, right.

32:15.733 --> 32:19.266
Yeah, you know something,
you haven't changed a bit.

32:19.333 --> 32:20.700
- Thirsty?
- Oh, no, thanks.

32:20.766 --> 32:22.566
Well, come in, uh..

32:22.633 --> 32:24.733
Sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

32:29.233 --> 32:30.233
Um..

32:32.833 --> 32:35.766
I just wanted to tell you
I'm a big fan of yours.

32:35.833 --> 32:37.500
No kidding.

32:37.566 --> 32:40.433
I've seen every movie
you've ever written.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.400
I sat through
seven consecutive screenings

32:42.466 --> 32:44.033
of "Attack
Of The Fungus People."

32:45.166 --> 32:46.433
Guess you are a fan.

32:46.500 --> 32:49.833
But my all time favorite,
was "Flesh Hound."

32:49.900 --> 32:52.033
I can't believe you didn't
receive an Oscar nomination

32:52.100 --> 32:53.300
'for that screenplay.'

32:53.366 --> 32:55.100
Hey, that's been the story
of my career.

32:55.166 --> 32:56.600
No recognition.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.766
Um..

32:59.833 --> 33:02.633
I spent a lot
of my free time writing.

33:02.700 --> 33:04.200
Oh, really?

33:04.266 --> 33:06.933
Actually, I just finished
a screenplay

33:07.000 --> 33:08.866
and I was wondering
if I could give it to you.

33:08.933 --> 33:10.900
I'd be honored
if you'd read it.

33:12.333 --> 33:15.533
Read it? Hell,
if it's any good, I'll steal it.

33:32.933 --> 33:35.366
'Nice dress.'

33:35.433 --> 33:37.333
My favorite color.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.033
Blood Red.

33:41.100 --> 33:43.933
It should go well
with your corsage.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.433
Who are you?

33:46.500 --> 33:48.300
Give you a hint.

33:49.633 --> 33:52.166
You said
you'd go to the prom with me.

33:53.766 --> 33:55.366
Oh, my God.

33:55.433 --> 33:56.433
Freddy?

33:58.533 --> 33:59.833
None other.

34:04.966 --> 34:07.533
The man of your dreams.

34:11.100 --> 34:13.133
Save the last dance for me.

34:13.200 --> 34:14.433
No!

34:15.033 --> 34:16.333
What was that?

34:18.533 --> 34:19.933
Denise?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.300
Are you alright?

34:22.800 --> 34:25.400
Talk to me, Denise.
What's going on?

34:25.466 --> 34:27.433
I just had a dream.

34:29.866 --> 34:31.200
About Freddy Krueger.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.533
You've lived your whole life
in Springwood

34:41.600 --> 34:43.066
haven't you?

34:43.133 --> 34:46.766
Do you believe in any of this
Freddy Krueger mumbo jumbo?

34:46.833 --> 34:50.533
You mean that he comes back and
kills people in their dreams?

34:50.600 --> 34:52.266
Yeah.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.366
No.

34:54.433 --> 34:57.566
It's true there's been
an unusually high

34:57.633 --> 35:01.500
number of unexplained deaths
in Springwood.

35:01.566 --> 35:05.233
But heck, you can't
blame them all on Freddy.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.900
He wasn't such a bad guy..

35:07.966 --> 35:09.933
...once you got to know him.

35:13.666 --> 35:14.733
Damn zipper.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.033
'Allow me.'

35:23.266 --> 35:24.766
Just stopped by

35:24.833 --> 35:26.900
for that last dance.

35:26.966 --> 35:28.566
I don't wanna dance.

35:28.633 --> 35:32.066
Oh, you're not gonna
stand me up again now, are you?

35:32.133 --> 35:34.566
No, no, I won't,
I won't stand you up.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.800
Well, that's good.

35:36.866 --> 35:40.200
First, you have to pin
your corsage on.

35:41.566 --> 35:43.833
I hope you like it.

35:46.333 --> 35:47.800
Ow!

35:47.866 --> 35:50.766
Damn. They make the pin
so little.

35:50.833 --> 35:53.000
Ow! Wait.

35:53.066 --> 35:56.433
I have something better.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.033
Denise?

36:10.900 --> 36:12.433
You alright?

36:27.100 --> 36:30.433
We heard a scream,
I ran in and, uh, there she was.

36:30.500 --> 36:33.133
She must have slipped
and fallen on the scissors

36:33.200 --> 36:34.866
How well did you know
Miss Charlotte?

36:34.933 --> 36:37.033
I hadn't seen her
since high school.

36:37.100 --> 36:39.733
What was she doing
in your room?

36:39.800 --> 36:42.433
I ran into her
in the hotel bar last night.

36:43.766 --> 36:46.433
Hey, what is this?
You think I killed her?

36:47.266 --> 36:48.900
It was an accident.

36:48.966 --> 36:51.400
You don't believe me?
Ask him.

36:51.466 --> 36:53.233
Tell him, Howard.

36:53.300 --> 36:55.800
That won't be necessary.

36:55.866 --> 36:58.466
When will you be checking out of
your hotel, Mr. Felton?

36:58.533 --> 37:01.600
Tomorrow morning. First thing.
Is that alright with you?

37:01.666 --> 37:03.466
Just need to know
where I can find you

37:03.533 --> 37:06.933
in case I have
any further questions.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.200
Have a good time,
at your reunion.

37:12.633 --> 37:14.600
Why didn't you tell him
about Denise's dream?

37:14.666 --> 37:17.033
- Yeah, because..
- What do you mean, "Because?"

37:17.100 --> 37:18.766
Because I don't want anyone else
to write this story.

37:18.833 --> 37:21.433
- It's mine.
- What are you talking about?

37:22.566 --> 37:24.100
Some guy who comes back
from the grave

37:24.166 --> 37:26.333
to, uh, murder people
in their dreams.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.000
Movie practically writes itself.

37:28.066 --> 37:29.900
'I'm gonna write this script
and it's gonna be the best one'

37:29.966 --> 37:31.333
I've ever written.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.066
A guaranteed blockbuster.

37:34.133 --> 37:36.566
Now, all I gotta do is,
write it.

38:06.766 --> 38:09.466
I still can't believe
Denise is gone.

38:09.533 --> 38:13.433
That makes 146 members
of our graduating class.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.200
We've run out of
sympathy cards.

38:15.266 --> 38:17.800
Do you guys notice
a pattern developing here?

38:17.866 --> 38:21.633
I guess, the only question is,
who's next.

38:21.700 --> 38:25.100
I've had enough of this grisly
talk, come and dance with me.

38:25.166 --> 38:28.000
- Oh-uh, Cindy. I don't know.
- Oh, fiddlesticks! Come on.

38:37.133 --> 38:39.733
Larry, did Denise ever mention

38:39.800 --> 38:42.833
having dreams
about Freddy Krueger?

38:42.900 --> 38:45.600
As a matter of fact, she did.
Just before she died.

38:47.166 --> 38:49.933
- Oh, my God.
- Why Cindy, what's wrong?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.233
I had a dream about him too.

38:52.300 --> 38:54.166
That means, I'm next.

38:54.233 --> 38:56.433
Cindy, hold on.
Let's not jump to conclusions.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.333
Why not? Can I come in?

39:02.633 --> 39:05.600
Ho! Ho! Ho!

39:09.400 --> 39:11.700
May I have this dance?

39:18.933 --> 39:19.966
Ready?

39:20.033 --> 39:21.700
And dip.

39:35.766 --> 39:38.033
Huh, where-where's
everybody goin'?

39:43.366 --> 39:46.433
This party is gonna be a gas.

40:32.066 --> 40:33.000
Yeah.

40:33.066 --> 40:36.433
Larry? It's me, Howard.
Howard Nehamkin.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.433
- Uh.
- 'Why aren't you down here?'

40:39.766 --> 40:42.133
This party could use
some fresh blood.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.900
Yeah, well, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

40:44.966 --> 40:46.800
Larry, are you alright?

40:47.733 --> 40:49.200
Uh, fantastic.

41:04.666 --> 41:07.466
Leo? Yeah, it's Larry.
You got my message.

41:07.533 --> 41:10.566
Ah-ha. No, I have not
finished the script.

41:10.633 --> 41:11.700
As a matter of fact,
I trashed it..

41:11.766 --> 41:13.366
Leo, will you listen to me?

41:13.433 --> 41:16.133
I got a script here that's gonna
knock your poppick off.

41:17.466 --> 41:18.533
Leo?

41:19.733 --> 41:22.333
Not so fast, red breath.

41:22.400 --> 41:26.000
You can't do my life story
without asking my permission.

41:26.066 --> 41:27.900
You gotta pay for the rights.

41:27.966 --> 41:30.566
And in your case,
it's gonna cost you your life.

41:30.633 --> 41:32.633
I mean you gotta have
heart to write

41:32.700 --> 41:34.100
the Freddy Krueger story.

41:34.166 --> 41:37.233
And, fella, that's something
you just ain't got.

41:56.033 --> 41:59.800
I can get fired for letting
you into somebody else's room.

41:59.866 --> 42:02.800
Oh, well, I-I appreciate
the risk you're taking.

42:04.633 --> 42:06.600
I'm telling you, man, you don't
wanna be in this room.

42:08.833 --> 42:10.833
What are you
looking for anyway?

42:11.766 --> 42:12.866
Him.

42:17.033 --> 42:19.400
What's his problem,
he drunk?

42:21.300 --> 42:22.800
No.

42:22.866 --> 42:24.133
He's dead.

42:25.300 --> 42:27.533
Mon dieu disgusto.

42:27.600 --> 42:30.333
My guess would be
from a heart attack.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.500
A major heart attack.

42:32.566 --> 42:34.000
Call an ambulance.

42:38.100 --> 42:39.633
I'll go tell the front desk.

42:39.700 --> 42:41.633
And then I'm outta this town.

42:43.266 --> 42:45.200
Too many negative waves.

43:35.166 --> 43:37.600
'That afternoon,
my old buddy Howard'

43:37.666 --> 43:39.733
caught a flight
to Hollywood.

43:39.800 --> 43:43.166
Sold his screenplay
and the rest as they say

43:43.233 --> 43:47.966
well, the rest is history.
Fame, fortune.

43:48.033 --> 43:50.800
My life story
on the silver screen.

43:50.866 --> 43:54.900
Uh-oh, if my friends
could see me now.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.600
But of course,
they're, uh, they're all dead.

44:17.933 --> 44:21.000
Th-th-th-that's all, folks!
