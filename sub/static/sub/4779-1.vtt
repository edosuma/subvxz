<i>¶ The neck bone's connected</i>

01:01.195 --> 01:03.829
<i>¶ To the head bone</i>

01:03.831 --> 01:06.565
<i>¶ The head bone's
connected to the horn bone</i>

01:06.567 --> 01:09.647
<i>¶ The horn bone's right
above the wing bones ¶</i>

01:13.173 --> 01:14.440
Ah!

01:14.442 --> 01:16.575
I scared you!
No, you didn't.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.377
Okay! Remember our field
trip rules, everyone.

01:18.379 --> 01:21.447
Uh, no pushing, no biting,
and no fire breathing!

01:21.449 --> 01:23.115
What did I just say?

01:23.117 --> 01:24.817
Eighteen, nineteen...

01:24.819 --> 01:27.100
Okay, we're missing one.
Who are we missing?

01:28.288 --> 01:29.755
Oh. Mike Wazowski.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.491
Thanks, Joe.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.493
Good luck finishing
your crossword puzzle.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.661
Sorry, Michael.
I didn't see you.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.629
That's okay.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.165
When I was on the bus,
I found a nickel!

01:40.167 --> 01:42.134
I wish I had pockets.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.576
Okay, everyone, partner up.
Get your field trip buddy.

01:46.172 --> 01:49.408
Jeremy! You and me?
Okay, no biggie.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.610
Hailey? No?
Pairing up with Claire?

01:51.612 --> 01:53.345
Great choice.
She's a good egg.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.313
Russell.

01:55.248 --> 01:56.715
Mike? Wazowski?

01:57.784 --> 01:58.784
We car-pool?

02:00.320 --> 02:02.221
- We're cousins.
- Hey!

02:02.223 --> 02:04.857
Okay. Good catching up.

02:04.859 --> 02:07.100
Well, Michael, it looks like
it's you and me again.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.234
Come on, Karen.
We're falling behind.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.716
Please don't call me Karen.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.876
<i>Now, stay close together.</i>

02:23.878 --> 02:26.745
We're entering
a very dangerous area.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.548
Welcome to the Scare Floor.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.883
Wow!

02:34.421 --> 02:36.855
This is where we
collect the Scream Energy

02:36.857 --> 02:39.224
to power our whole world.

02:39.226 --> 02:42.194
And can anyone tell me whose
job it is to go get that scream?

02:42.196 --> 02:43.262
Scarers!

02:43.264 --> 02:44.730
That's right!

02:44.732 --> 02:46.798
Now, which one of you can
give me the scariest roar?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.800
Me, me, me!

02:48.802 --> 02:50.669
Oh! Sir! Right here! Little green guy,

02:50.671 --> 02:52.171
two o'clock!

02:52.173 --> 02:53.705
No, it's like this.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.207
Hey, guys, watch this one.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.289
Hey, I got a really good...

02:59.646 --> 03:00.812
Wow!

03:12.926 --> 03:13.959
Whoa.

03:16.462 --> 03:18.697
Well, hey there, kids. Are
you on a tour with your school?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.199
- Yeah!
- Yes.

03:20.201 --> 03:22.201
We're here to learn
about Scream Energy

03:22.203 --> 03:24.503
and what it takes
to be a Scarer.

03:24.505 --> 03:28.340
Well, hey, you're in luck, because
I just happen to be a Scarer.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.309
I learned everything
I know from my school,

03:30.311 --> 03:31.677
Monsters University.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.779
Whoa.

03:33.781 --> 03:34.746
It's the best
Scaring School there is.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.416
You wish!
Fear Tech's the best.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.284
Okay. You guys
watch us and tell me

03:39.286 --> 03:41.046
which school's the best.
All right?

03:41.354 --> 03:42.254
MU is.

03:44.402 --> 03:45.625
Let's go, everybody!

03:45.626 --> 03:48.527
<i>West coast coming onli.</i>

03:48.529 --> 03:50.529
<i>Scarers coming o.</i>

03:50.531 --> 03:51.897
Oops.
Stop right there.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.765
Don't cross over
that safety line.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.901
Human children
are extremely toxic.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.371
Look at that!

03:59.373 --> 04:01.740
Whoa! Hey, guys,
watch the eye! Ow!

04:01.742 --> 04:02.908
Look at that! It's amazing!

04:02.910 --> 04:04.843
I know!

04:04.845 --> 04:06.612
- Wow!
- Excuse me. Fellas.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.855
How about we do tallest in the back?

04:10.351 --> 04:11.717
Look, he's going to

04:11.719 --> 04:13.552
do a real scare!

04:15.556 --> 04:16.555
Cool. I want to
be a Scarer.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.923
Yeah. Me, too.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.458
Come on, guys.
I want to see.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.526
Out of the way, Wazowski.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.809
You don't belong
on a Scare Floor.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.773
Brian! Do not step
over the line.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.942
Mrs. Graves, Michael went over the line.

04:38.811 --> 04:40.412
Michael!

05:16.849 --> 05:18.850
See?
I told you. He's fine.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.485
Well,
I thought I heard something.

05:45.712 --> 05:46.678
What?

05:51.417 --> 05:53.552
Are you okay?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.887
You could have gotten hurt!

05:55.889 --> 05:58.583
I don't understand
how this could happen!

06:00.626 --> 06:03.347
That was real dangerous, kid. I
didn't even know you were in there.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.035
Wow. I didn't even know
you were in there.

06:11.904 --> 06:13.038
Not bad, kid.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.755
Michael, what do you have
to say for yourself?

06:20.513 --> 06:23.014
How do I become a Scarer?

07:13.966 --> 07:16.168
Monsters University!
Anybody getting off?

07:19.706 --> 07:21.706
Well, everyone, I don't
mean to get emotional,

07:21.708 --> 07:24.109
but everything in my life
has led to this moment.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.077
Let it not be just the
beginning of my dream

07:26.079 --> 07:27.746
but the beginning
of all of our dreams.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.915
Gladys, promise me
you'll keep auditioning.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.451
Marie, Mr. Right is
out there somewhere.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.586
Phil, keep using the ointment
till that thing goes away.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.055
I wish you all the best.
Thank you all so much!

07:41.194 --> 07:43.962
I'm welling up with tears.
Now, get off.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.193
Hello. How are you doing?

08:23.737 --> 08:24.603
Ah!

08:26.539 --> 08:27.706
Whoo-hoo!

08:32.111 --> 08:34.179
Stroke! Stroke!

08:34.181 --> 08:35.581
Come on,
put all you have into it!

08:36.048 --> 08:37.028
Stroke! Stroke!

08:40.753 --> 08:42.988
Okay! First thing on
my list, get registered.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.557
Hey there, freshman.
I'm Jay the R.A.,

08:45.559 --> 08:47.659
and I'm here to say that
registration is thataway!

08:47.661 --> 08:49.227
Okay, Jay.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.229
Have a great first day.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.665
Hey, I'm Kay! Here's
your orientation packet.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.166
Thanks, Kay.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.768
You can drop your bags off here

08:56.770 --> 08:58.003
and get your
picture taken with Trey.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.725
Say hooray!
Hooray!

09:00.139 --> 09:02.073
I can't believe it.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.843
I'm officially
a college student!

09:04.845 --> 09:07.178
Okay, everyone, I'm Fay,

09:07.180 --> 09:10.781
and I'll be giving you your
orientation tour on this perfect day!

09:14.854 --> 09:17.022
Here are the labs
where students learn

09:17.024 --> 09:19.424
to design and build the
doors to the human world.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.933
Looks like the professor
is about to test a door!

09:37.610 --> 09:42.080
The MU cafeteria serves a
full buffet, three meals a day.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.723
I personally believe we have some
of the best chefs in the world.

09:46.686 --> 09:47.953
Oh! Yeah!

09:47.955 --> 09:49.888
Yeah!

09:49.890 --> 09:52.824
The campus offers
a wide variety of majors,

09:52.826 --> 09:57.128
but the crown jewel of MU
is the Scaring School.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.645
Welcome to the debate team.
We're happy to have you.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.981
I disagree for
the following reasons.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.082
True happiness is a
theoretical construct...

10:17.084 --> 10:19.884
Hey there! Keep
your eye on the sky

10:19.886 --> 10:21.353
at the astronomy club!

10:26.826 --> 10:28.893
Hey, hey, hey! Come
join the improv club.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.729
You'll wish you were a...
Never... Always...

10:30.731 --> 10:32.397
Ah, dang it!

10:32.399 --> 10:36.635
MU's Greek Council. We
sponsor the annual Scare Games.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.669
The Scare what now?

10:37.671 --> 10:39.170
The Scare Games!

10:39.172 --> 10:41.306
A super-intense
Scaring competition!

10:41.308 --> 10:44.275
They're crazy dangerous,
so anything could happen.

10:44.277 --> 10:47.145
A bunch of guys went
to the hospital last year!

10:47.147 --> 10:48.313
You could totally die.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.115
And it's worth it.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.117
You get a chance to prove
that you are the best!

10:53.185 --> 10:54.119
Cool.

10:55.921 --> 10:56.955
Wazowski, Room 319.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.351
You know, your roommate
is a Scaring major, too.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.162
"Hello, I'm your roommate. "
Oh, that's too bland.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.364
Don't force it.
Just let it happen.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.934
Your lifelong best friend
is right behind this door.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.177
Hey there.
I'm your roomie.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.346
Name's Randy Boggs.
Scaring major.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.082
Oh!
Mike Wazowski, Scaring major.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.817
I can tell we're going
to be best chums, Mike.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.686
Take whichever bed you want.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.720
I wanted you to
have first dibs.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.188
Ahh!

11:30.190 --> 11:32.123
You just disappeared.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.260
Sorry. If I do that in
Scaring class, I'll be a joke.

11:35.262 --> 11:38.063
No, it's totally great.
You got to use it.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.297
Really?
Yeah, but lose the glasses.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.100
They give it away.
Huh.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.076
Okay!

11:51.078 --> 11:54.345
Unpack. Check.
Hang posters. Check.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.481
Now I just need to ace my
classes, graduate with honors,

11:56.483 --> 11:58.450
and become
the greatest Scarer ever.

11:58.452 --> 12:00.385
Boy, I wish I had
your confidence, Mike.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.820
Aren't you even
a little nervous?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.154
Actually, no.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.537
I've been waiting
for this my whole life.

12:10.096 --> 12:12.030
I just can't
wait to get started.

12:28.147 --> 12:31.149
Oh, man! I can't be
late on the first day!

12:58.878 --> 12:59.778
Wow.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.296
You got to be kidding me.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.799
I'm so nervous!

13:20.801 --> 13:22.333
Relax. It will be fine.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.256
Good morning, students.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.236
Welcome to Scaring 101.

13:26.038 --> 13:28.473
I am Professor Knight.

13:28.475 --> 13:32.143
Now I'm sure all of you were the
scariest monster in your town.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.180
Well, bad news, kids.
You're in my town now,

13:35.182 --> 13:36.915
and I do not scare easily.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.429
Dean Hardscrabble.
This is a pleasant surprise.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.467
She's a legend.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.269
She broke
the all-time Scare Record

13:58.271 --> 13:59.632
with the scream
in that very can!

14:01.106 --> 14:02.974
I don't mean to interrupt.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.976
I just thought I'd drop by

14:04.978 --> 14:08.246
to see the terrifying faces
joining my program.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.549
Well, I'm sure my students
would love to hear

14:11.551 --> 14:13.117
a few words of inspiration.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.855
Inspiration? Very well.

14:19.024 --> 14:23.595
Scariness is the true
measure of a monster.

14:23.597 --> 14:24.863
If you're not scary

14:26.432 --> 14:28.132
what kind of a monster are you?

14:31.036 --> 14:33.277
It's my job to make
great students greater,

14:35.374 --> 14:40.078
not make mediocre students
less mediocre.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.120
That is why at the end of the
semester there will be a final exam.

14:45.184 --> 14:49.254
Fail that exam and you are
out of the Scaring program.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.528
So, I should hope you're
all properly inspired.

15:04.336 --> 15:06.404
All right. All right.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.374
Who can tell me the properties
of an effective roar?

15:10.442 --> 15:11.276
Yes?

15:12.344 --> 15:14.512
There are actually five.

15:14.514 --> 15:17.015
Those include
the roar's resonance,

15:17.017 --> 15:19.050
the duration of the roar,
and the...

15:23.055 --> 15:24.989
Whoops. Sorry.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.659
I heard someone say "roar,"
so I just kind of went for it.

15:27.661 --> 15:30.028
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.196
I didn't mean to scare you
there. Hey, how you doing?

15:32.198 --> 15:34.032
Very impressive, Mister...

15:34.034 --> 15:35.333
Sullivan.
Jimmy Sullivan.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.335
Sullivan.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.437
Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.539
Yeah. He's my dad.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.242
He's a Sullivan!

15:44.244 --> 15:47.312
I should have known.
I expect big things from you.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.281
Well, you won't
be disappointed.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.350
Uh... I'm sorry.
Should I keep going?

15:52.352 --> 15:54.152
No, no.
Mr. Sullivan's covered it.

15:56.188 --> 15:57.622
Huh.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.657
Everyone take out
your Scaring textbooks

15:59.659 --> 16:01.626
and open them to chapter one.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.561
Hey, bub.
Can I borrow a pencil?

16:03.563 --> 16:05.697
I forgot all my stuff.

16:05.699 --> 16:08.199
Ah! All right. Yes. There
we go. That will get it.

16:08.667 --> 16:11.169
Mmm... Yeah.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.071
Come on, Mike.
It's a fraternity

16:13.073 --> 16:15.440
and sorority party.
We have to go!

16:15.442 --> 16:17.375
If we flunk that Scaring
final, we are done.

16:18.410 --> 16:19.744
I'm not taking any chances.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.346
You've got
the whole semester to study,

16:21.348 --> 16:23.114
but this might
be our only chance

16:23.116 --> 16:25.216
to get in good
with the cool kids.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.118
That's why I made these cupcakes. Oops.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.654
That could
have been embarrassing.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.589
When I'm a Scarer, life
will be a nonstop party.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.490
Stay out of trouble, wild man.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.291
Wild man.

16:46.605 --> 16:47.445
What the...

16:49.509 --> 16:51.609
Archie!

16:53.145 --> 16:54.746
Boo!

16:54.748 --> 16:55.549
Hey! What are you...

16:57.016 --> 16:59.384
Wait... You're shushing me?
Hey! Hey! You can't...

17:01.321 --> 17:02.420
- Where did he go?
- He's dead meat.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.421
That guy's in big trouble.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.303
Yeah, he is.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.224
Hey, guys!
Over here!

17:08.595 --> 17:09.794
Fear Tech dummies.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.628
Oh, oh!

17:11.631 --> 17:12.730
Sorry about that, buddy.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.098
Why are you in my room?

17:14.099 --> 17:15.339
Your room? This is my...

17:16.367 --> 17:18.036
This is not my room.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.404
Archie! Come here, boy.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.738
Archie?

17:20.740 --> 17:23.141
Archie the Scare Pig.
He's Fear Tech's mascot.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.509
Why is it here?

17:24.511 --> 17:26.377
I stole it. Going to
take it to the RORs.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.112
The what?

17:28.114 --> 17:31.482
Roar Omega Roar.
The top fraternity on campus.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.584
They only accept
the highly elite.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.254
Okay, I'll lift the bed,
you grab the pig.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.755
Ready? One, two, three.
What? No, no... Oh! What...

17:37.757 --> 17:39.257
That's it.
Don't let go.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.224
Careful. He's a biter.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.762
- Whoa! Whoa, hey...
- Whoa!

17:46.699 --> 17:48.099
I got him!

17:48.101 --> 17:49.400
Uh-oh! Whoa!

17:52.539 --> 17:54.572
That was awesome!

17:54.574 --> 17:57.375
What am I doing?
James P. Sullivan.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.677
Mike Wazowski.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.845
Listen, it was quite
delightful meeting you

18:00.847 --> 18:02.580
and whatever that is,

18:02.582 --> 18:05.216
but if you don't mind,
I have to study my Scaring.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.150
You don't need
to study Scaring.

18:06.152 --> 18:08.086
You just do it.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.488
Really? I think there's a
little more to it than that.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.823
But, hey, thanks
for stopping by.

18:11.825 --> 18:12.757
Let go of that!

18:14.693 --> 18:16.160
My hat!
My pig!

18:17.130 --> 18:17.829
Ooh!

18:19.731 --> 18:21.232
Hey! Come here!

18:21.234 --> 18:22.500
Hey!

18:23.470 --> 18:24.710
Catch it!

18:25.704 --> 18:27.051
Come back here!

18:28.140 --> 18:29.173
Ooh! Yeah!

18:29.175 --> 18:30.508
Ride it to frat row!

18:33.580 --> 18:35.680
<i>¶ Tentacles and
serpent's wings, they... ¶</i>

18:35.682 --> 18:36.562
Hey!

18:37.349 --> 18:39.417
Whoa... Ow!

18:45.190 --> 18:46.224
Wow!

18:50.196 --> 18:51.362
Whoa!

18:52.832 --> 18:54.499
Go, go, go!

18:54.501 --> 18:55.700
Hey...

18:55.702 --> 18:57.668
Come on! Hey!
Ooh!

18:57.670 --> 18:59.237
Cupcake?

19:02.207 --> 19:03.241
Whoa...

19:13.252 --> 19:14.285
Ooh!

19:21.593 --> 19:22.827
Got it!

19:27.767 --> 19:29.447
Fear Tech's mascot!
MU rules!

19:36.441 --> 19:37.542
M- U! M-U! M-U!

19:39.244 --> 19:41.479
Did you see him catch that pig?

19:41.481 --> 19:43.614
You are Jaws Theta Chi
material, freshman.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.682
Oh, thanks.
I don't know...

19:44.684 --> 19:46.784
No, no, no.
He's an Omega Howl guy.

19:46.786 --> 19:47.818
Back off.
We saw him first.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.654
No way. We did!

19:49.656 --> 19:51.322
I'll take it
from here, gentlemen.

19:52.658 --> 19:55.498
Johnny Worthington,
president of Roar Omega Roar.

19:56.328 --> 19:57.528
What's your name, big blue?

19:57.530 --> 19:59.730
Jimmy Sullivan.
Friends call me Sulley.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.400
This guy's a Sullivan?
Like the famous Sullivan?

20:02.402 --> 20:03.801
I can't believe it!
That is crazy!

20:03.803 --> 20:05.803
Chet, calm down.
I'm sorry.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.839
Sulley, any freshman with the
guts to pull off a stunt like that

20:08.841 --> 20:11.509
has got "Future Scarer"
written all over him.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.945
Hey, did you see me ride
the pig? That took guts.

20:13.947 --> 20:17.348
Slow down, squirt. This party
is for Scare students only.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.617
Oh, sorry, killer, but
you might want to hang out

20:19.619 --> 20:21.219
with someone
a little more your speed.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.721
Uh... They look fun!

20:23.723 --> 20:25.623
Oh, hey there. Want
to join Oozma Kappa?

20:25.625 --> 20:26.426
We have cake.

20:30.329 --> 20:31.929
Go crazy.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.232
Is that a joke?

20:34.234 --> 20:36.867
Sulley, talk to your friend.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.604
Oh, he's not really
my friend, but sure.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.606
You heard him. This is a
party for Scare students.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.407
I am a Scare student.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.243
I mean for Scare
students who actually,

20:45.245 --> 20:47.612
you know, have a chance.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.680
Aw, snap!

20:49.682 --> 20:52.450
My chances are
just as good as yours.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.384
You're not even in the
same league with me.

20:54.553 --> 20:55.987
Just wait, hotshot.

20:55.989 --> 20:58.522
I'm going to scare circles
around you this year.

20:58.524 --> 20:59.824
Oh, okay.
I'd like to see that.

21:00.859 --> 21:03.394
Oh, don't worry. You will.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.835
Ready position.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.737
Common crouch.

21:12.739 --> 21:16.741
I want to see matted fur and
yellow teeth. Basic snarl.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.676
Show me some slobber.

21:18.678 --> 21:21.038
Drool is a tool,
kids. Use it.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.075
Now here is a monster
who looks like a Scarer.

21:25.884 --> 21:28.486
You want a hope of passing
this class, you better eat,

21:28.488 --> 21:29.954
breathe, and sleep Scaring.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.549
Yeah!

21:58.551 --> 21:59.850
Give me another one.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.485
Fear of spiders.
Arachnophobia.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.753
Fear of thunder.
Keraunophobia.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.889
Fear of chopsticks!
Consecotaleophobia.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.811
What is this, kindergarten?
Give me a hard one.

22:08.061 --> 22:10.094
Go Monsters U!
You know what to do!

22:20.405 --> 22:21.872
The answer is C, fangs.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.574
Well done, Mr. Wazowski.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.643
A bowl of spiders!
Correct!

22:25.645 --> 22:27.778
A clown running in the dark!
Right again.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.647
Warts, boils, and moles,
in that order.

22:29.649 --> 22:30.548
Outstanding!

22:43.562 --> 22:44.762
Ah! Whoa!

22:45.898 --> 22:47.698
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:12.724 --> 23:13.791
Ah!

23:21.800 --> 23:23.000
Ogre slump.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.468
Zombie snarl.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.510
Dominant silverback gorilla.

23:26.773 --> 23:29.673
That is some remarkable
improvement, Michael.

23:31.711 --> 23:34.912
One frightening face does not
a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan.

23:49.127 --> 23:50.961
A Tauntaun grimace
with extra slobber.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.164
You got it!
That's what I'm saying.

23:53.166 --> 23:55.800
I am going to wipe the floor
with that little know-it-all.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.935
Yes, you are, big blue.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.603
Hey, wait.
What are you guys...

23:59.605 --> 24:01.172
It's just a precaution.

24:01.174 --> 24:03.808
RORs are the best Scarers
on campus, Sullivan.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.576
Can't have a member getting
shown up by a beach ball.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.645
Whoo-hoo!
I am on a roll.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.480
I'm going to destroy that guy.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.549
Well, then you'll get
this back right away.

24:11.551 --> 24:14.018
It's time to start delivering
on that Sullivan name.

24:18.924 --> 24:21.459
Today's final will judge your
ability to assess a child's fear

24:21.461 --> 24:25.095
and perform the appropriate
Scare in the Scare Simulator.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.704
The Child Sensitivity
Level will be raised

24:33.706 --> 24:36.640
from Bed-wetter
to Heavy Sleeper,

24:36.642 --> 24:39.577
so give it
everything you've got.

24:39.579 --> 24:42.012
Dean Hardscrabble is
with us this morning

24:42.014 --> 24:43.481
to see who will be moving on
in the Scaring program

24:44.249 --> 24:45.489
and who will not.

24:51.122 --> 24:54.024
Let's get started.

24:54.026 --> 24:57.066
I am a five-year-old girl afraid
of spiders and Santa Claus.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.236
Which Scare do you use?

25:00.065 --> 25:01.065
Uh...

25:05.837 --> 25:06.904
That's a Seasonal
Creep and Crawl.

25:07.539 --> 25:08.539
Demonstrate.

25:17.283 --> 25:20.117
Results will be posted
outside my office. Next.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.820
Focus.

25:22.822 --> 25:25.189
Johnson, Crackle and Howl.
Yes!

25:40.272 --> 25:41.639
Hey. Do you mind?

25:42.607 --> 25:43.367
Don't mind at all.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.680
Come on, Mike.
Let's just move.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.552
Stay out of my way.

25:54.554 --> 25:57.874
Unlike you, I had to work hard
to get into the Scare program.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.658
That's because
you don't belong here.

26:10.702 --> 26:11.582
That's what I thought.

26:28.720 --> 26:29.853
Whoa! Whoa...

27:14.933 --> 27:16.333
I'm so sorry.

27:16.335 --> 27:17.935
It was an accident.

27:18.903 --> 27:21.071
What? This?

27:21.073 --> 27:24.074
My one souvenir from
a lifetime of Scaring?

27:25.210 --> 27:28.879
Accidents happen, don't they.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.015
The important thing
is no one got hurt.

27:33.084 --> 27:34.685
You're taking
this remarkably well.

27:35.286 --> 27:38.255
Now, let's continue the exams.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.924
Mr. Wazowski,
I'm a five-year-old girl

27:40.926 --> 27:42.960
on a farm in Kansas
afraid of lightning.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.028
Which Scare do you use?

27:45.830 --> 27:47.364
Shouldn't I go up on the...

27:47.366 --> 27:49.199
Which Scare do you use?

27:50.902 --> 27:53.037
That is a Shadow Approach
with a Crackle Holler.

27:53.039 --> 27:53.904
Demonstrate.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.208
Stop. Thank you.
But I didn't get to...

27:58.210 --> 27:59.343
I've seen enough.

28:01.046 --> 28:02.446
I'm a seven-year-old boy...

28:05.116 --> 28:07.151
I wasn't finished.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.420
I don't need to know
any of that stuff to scare.

28:09.422 --> 28:12.056
That "stuff"
would've informed you

28:12.058 --> 28:15.693
that this particular child
is afraid of snakes.

28:15.695 --> 28:18.195
So a roar wouldn't make him
scream, it would make him cry,

28:18.197 --> 28:20.998
alerting his parents,
exposing the monster world,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.833
destroying life as we know it,

28:22.835 --> 28:24.835
and of course
we can't have that.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.804
So I'm afraid I cannot
recommend that you continue

28:26.806 --> 28:29.440
in the Scaring program.
Good day.

28:29.442 --> 28:32.242
Wait, what?
But I'm a Sullivan.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.178
Well then, I'm sure your family

28:34.180 --> 28:35.879
will be very disappointed.

28:51.763 --> 28:54.965
And, Mr. Wazowski,
what you lack is something

28:54.967 --> 28:56.233
that cannot be taught.

28:58.002 --> 28:59.236
You're not scary.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.408
You will not be continuing
in the Scaring program.

29:06.778 --> 29:09.499
Please. Let me try the
simulator. I'll surprise you.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.916
Surprise me?
I doubt that very much.

29:25.765 --> 29:26.285
<i>Welcome back.</i>

29:28.032 --> 29:30.432
<i>I hope everyone
had a pleasant bre.</i>

29:32.170 --> 29:36.507
Some say that a career as a
scream-can designer is boring,

29:36.509 --> 29:40.477
unchallenging, a waste
of a monster's potential.

29:43.816 --> 29:47.084
Open your textbooks
to chapter three.

29:47.086 --> 29:50.020
We will now plunge
into the rich history

29:50.022 --> 29:51.262
of scream-can design.

30:38.036 --> 30:39.069
Out of my way!

30:40.205 --> 30:41.885
Coming through!
Oh, sorry. Ha-ha!

30:43.308 --> 30:47.544
<i>Welcome to this year's
Greek Scare Games kickoff.</i>

30:47.546 --> 30:49.313
<i>The Scare Game!
Yeah!</i>

30:50.933 --> 30:51.850
<i>Okay, relax.</i>

30:51.851 --> 30:57.087
<i>We have a special guest,
the founder of the games,</i>

30:57.089 --> 30:59.289
<i>Dean Hardscrabble.</i>

31:01.326 --> 31:02.606
<i>Good afterno.</i>

31:03.494 --> 31:06.129
<i>As a student,
I created these gas</i>

31:06.131 --> 31:07.397
<i>as a friendly competition,</i>

31:08.299 --> 31:10.500
<i>but be prepared.</i>

31:10.502 --> 31:12.436
<i>To take home the troph,</i>

31:12.438 --> 31:15.398
<i>you must be the most
fearsome monsters on campus.</i>

31:17.243 --> 31:20.978
<i>So good luck, and may
the best monsters wi.</i>

31:20.980 --> 31:24.281
<i>We're closing down sign-,
so we'll see you all...</i>

31:24.283 --> 31:25.148
Wait!

31:27.385 --> 31:28.352
I'm signing up!

31:30.421 --> 31:31.655
What?

31:34.525 --> 31:36.560
<i>Uh... You have to be in
a fraterniy to compete.</i>

31:36.562 --> 31:39.663
Behold the next winning
fraternity of the Scare Games,

31:39.665 --> 31:43.967
the brothers, my brothers,
of Oozma Kappa!

31:45.670 --> 31:47.271
Hi.

31:49.574 --> 31:52.175
Mr. Wazowski,
what are you doing?

31:52.177 --> 31:54.611
You just said the winners are the
most fearsome monsters on campus.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.680
If I win, it means you
kicked out the best Scarer

31:56.682 --> 31:58.415
in the whole school.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.538
That won't happen.

32:00.184 --> 32:02.519
How about a little wager?

32:02.521 --> 32:05.188
If I win, you let me back
in the Scaring program.

32:07.325 --> 32:08.692
And what would that prove?

32:09.594 --> 32:10.560
That you were wrong.

32:14.565 --> 32:16.500
Very well.

32:16.502 --> 32:19.603
If you win, I will
let your entire team

32:19.605 --> 32:21.071
into the Scare program.

32:23.207 --> 32:25.943
But if you lose,

32:25.945 --> 32:28.186
you will leave
Monsters University.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.583
Deal.

32:33.585 --> 32:37.020
Now all you need to do is
find enough members to compete.

32:37.022 --> 32:38.155
We need six guys, right?

32:38.157 --> 32:40.023
<i>Sorry, chief.</i>

32:40.025 --> 32:42.592
<i>We count bodies, not heads.
That dude counts as one.</i>

32:44.430 --> 32:46.496
Anybody else want to join
our team? Anyone at all?

32:46.498 --> 32:48.065
Excuse me.
Sorry. I'm late.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.399
Can I squeeze by you?
Randy!

32:49.401 --> 32:51.501
Randy, thank goodness.
I need you on my team.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.670
Oh. Sorry.
I'm already on a team.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.238
Boggs.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.374
I'm finally in with
the cool kids, Mike.

32:57.376 --> 32:58.576
Don't blow this for me.

33:00.345 --> 33:02.245
Do the thing.

33:02.247 --> 33:04.214
Oh! Where did he go?

33:04.216 --> 33:05.482
Please, anybody.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.085
I need one more monster.
Just one more!

33:08.087 --> 33:10.020
<i>Yeah, sorry.
Doesn't look good.</i>

33:10.022 --> 33:12.055
<i>We have to move on.
Your team doesn't qualify.</i>

33:12.057 --> 33:13.123
Yes, it does!

33:14.993 --> 33:17.594
The star player
has just arrived.

33:17.596 --> 33:20.998
No way! Someone else!
Please! Anyone else.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.480
<i>We're shutting down sign-ups,
okay? Is he on your team or not?</i>

33:25.603 --> 33:26.536
Come on! Let's go!

33:29.307 --> 33:31.148
Fine! Yes,
he's on my team.

33:31.676 --> 33:32.597
Good luck.

33:35.646 --> 33:37.547
All right, Wazowski,
what's the plan?

33:43.221 --> 33:45.422
This is a fraternity house?

33:45.424 --> 33:48.525
Hey there, teammateys!
Come on aboard!

33:50.194 --> 33:52.462
As the president
of Oozma Kappa,

33:52.464 --> 33:55.944
it is my honor to welcome
you to your new home.

33:56.501 --> 33:59.202
We call this room
"Party Central. "

33:59.204 --> 34:00.771
Technically, we haven't
actually had a party here yet.

34:00.773 --> 34:02.934
But when we do, we'll be ready!

34:09.147 --> 34:10.679
Whoo!

34:10.681 --> 34:14.217
The hot cocoa train
is coming through! Whoa!

34:14.219 --> 34:16.186
Next stop... You!

34:16.188 --> 34:18.455
I would like to
start us off first by...

34:18.456 --> 34:21.224
So, you guys
are Scaring majors?

34:21.226 --> 34:24.360
We were! None of us lasted very long.

34:24.362 --> 34:27.431
I guess we just weren't what
old Hardscrabble was looking for.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.065
Don Carlton, mature student.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.768
Thirty years in
the textile industry

34:32.771 --> 34:35.072
and then old dandy Don
got downsized.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.107
Figured I could throw
myself a pity party,

34:37.109 --> 34:39.208
or go back to school
and learn the computers.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.210
Hello. I'm Terry
with a "Y"...

34:41.213 --> 34:43.780
And I'm Terri with an "I"!
I'm a dance major!

34:43.782 --> 34:45.348
And I'm not.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.451
Five, six, seven, eight!

34:47.453 --> 34:49.553
Seven, eight, turn! And...
Why didn't you turn?

34:49.554 --> 34:51.822
Because we never
agreed to do this!

34:51.824 --> 34:53.190
You said this was
going to be cool!

34:53.192 --> 34:54.524
No one said
this was gonna be cool.

34:54.525 --> 34:55.625
Now I'm embarrassed.
Now you're embarrassed?

34:55.627 --> 34:57.527
Yes, because
it's in front of people!

34:57.529 --> 34:58.395
You should wake up embarrassed.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.297
Hey, hey, hey!

35:00.299 --> 35:03.333
I'm Art!
New Age philosophy major.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.455
Excited to live with you
and laugh with you,

35:06.204 --> 35:07.304
and cry with you.

35:09.674 --> 35:12.074
Thought you might like
to keep a dream journal.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.112
Guess that leaves me.
Ah!

35:15.114 --> 35:16.546
My name's Scott Squibbles.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.281
My friends call me Squishy.

35:18.283 --> 35:20.584
I'm undeclared, unattached,

35:20.586 --> 35:25.255
and unwelcome pretty much
everywhere but here.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.257
Now that we've all been introduced,
as captain of our team...

35:27.259 --> 35:30.160
So, basically, you guys have
no Scaring experience?

35:30.162 --> 35:33.396
Not a lot!
But now we've got you!

35:33.398 --> 35:35.499
You're about the scariest
fella I've ever seen.

35:35.501 --> 35:36.700
Even with them pink polka dots.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.835
Aw, thanks.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.570
Actually, I think I bring
the whole package.

35:40.572 --> 35:42.339
Your hands are
as big as my face!

35:42.341 --> 35:43.907
He's like a mountain with fur!

35:43.909 --> 35:46.443
Oh, come on.
I don't even work out.

35:46.445 --> 35:50.714
- Yeah, me neither.
- I don't want to get too big.

35:50.716 --> 35:53.617
We thought our dreams were
over, but Mike said if we win,

35:53.619 --> 35:55.185
they're letting us in
the Scaring program.

35:55.187 --> 35:57.320
We're going to be real Scarers!

35:57.322 --> 35:59.189
The best!
You betcha!

35:59.191 --> 36:00.257
Yeah!
Right.

36:03.194 --> 36:05.695
And here's what you've been
waiting for, fellas.

36:05.697 --> 36:07.898
Your very own
Oozma Kappa bedroom.

36:08.733 --> 36:11.935
Oh... Great!
We're sharing this room?

36:11.937 --> 36:14.171
We'll let you guys get settled.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.506
Anything you need, you just
give a big holler-oonie!

36:16.508 --> 36:19.576
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are you kidding me?

36:19.578 --> 36:20.744
Look, they don't
need to be good.

36:20.746 --> 36:22.479
I'm going to
carry the whole team.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.781
Really? And who's
going to carry you?

36:24.783 --> 36:26.216
Hey, if you want to
go back to can design,

36:26.218 --> 36:27.339
you know where the door is.

36:30.289 --> 36:31.188
Great.

36:33.524 --> 36:34.457
Guys?

36:35.660 --> 36:36.741
Anybody home?

36:42.967 --> 36:44.434
Um...

36:44.436 --> 36:45.502
Hello?

36:46.437 --> 36:47.677
Fellas?

36:53.778 --> 36:56.780
Do you pledge your souls

36:56.782 --> 36:58.748
to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood?

36:58.750 --> 36:59.783
Ow!
Do you swear to

36:59.785 --> 37:01.251
keep secret...

37:01.253 --> 37:02.385
all that
you learn here?

37:02.387 --> 37:04.688
No matter how horrifying?

37:04.922 --> 37:07.290
Hey!

37:07.292 --> 37:08.825
Will you take the sacred
oath of the...

37:08.827 --> 37:10.994
For crying out loud.
Sweetie!

37:10.996 --> 37:12.896
Turn the lights on
while you're down here!

37:12.898 --> 37:14.798
You're going to ruin your eyes!

37:14.800 --> 37:17.701
Mom!
We're doing an initiation!

37:17.703 --> 37:20.537
Oh, scary.
Well, carry on.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.539
Just pretend I'm not here.

37:22.541 --> 37:23.622
This is my mom's house.

37:25.676 --> 37:27.837
Do you promise to look out
for your brothers...

37:30.314 --> 37:31.915
no matter what the peril?

37:34.820 --> 37:38.788
Will you defend Oozma Kappa
no matter how dangerous?

37:38.790 --> 37:41.858
No matter how insurmountable
the odds may be?

37:41.860 --> 37:44.794
From evils both
great and small?

37:44.796 --> 37:46.716
In the face of
unending pain and...

37:47.798 --> 37:50.700
Oh, forget it!
You're in.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.502
Look, we know
we're no one's first choice

37:52.504 --> 37:54.004
for a fraternity,

37:54.006 --> 37:56.406
so it means a lot
to have you here with us.

37:56.408 --> 37:59.643
Can't wait to start Scaring
with you, brothers.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.454
Time for a celebration!
Yeah!

38:11.456 --> 38:12.989
Grab the couch cushions,
gentlemen,

38:12.991 --> 38:14.871
because we're building a fort!

38:16.560 --> 38:18.640
Mom, can we
stay up late tonight?

38:34.779 --> 38:37.139
Mmm, I know you're a princess
and I'm just a stable boy.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.516
Yuck!

38:40.484 --> 38:42.085
Mom! What are you doing?

38:42.087 --> 38:43.987
Your grubby paw was in my bed!

38:43.989 --> 38:45.388
Were you kissing my hand?

38:46.792 --> 38:48.358
No. And what about you
with all your shedding?

38:48.360 --> 38:50.320
I don't shed.
Really.

38:50.394 --> 38:51.861
Uh...

38:51.863 --> 38:53.029
Excuse me.
I just want to get my stuff.

38:53.031 --> 38:54.864
Would you just...
Oh, hey. Come on!

38:54.866 --> 38:55.965
let me get my stuff!

38:55.967 --> 38:57.334
My butt!

38:59.604 --> 39:00.870
First morning in the house.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.739
That's going in the album!

39:02.741 --> 39:03.940
Guys!
We got a letter!

39:03.942 --> 39:05.675
A letter?

39:05.677 --> 39:07.344
We never get mail.

39:07.346 --> 39:08.545
Oh! Sorry.
It's stuck.

39:08.547 --> 39:09.846
Would you...
Give me that!

39:09.848 --> 39:12.382
Tentacles.
They're sticky.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.351
It's the first event
of the Scare Games.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.054
"A child's room
is where you scare,

39:18.056 --> 39:20.990
"but avoid
the toxicity lurking there. "

39:20.992 --> 39:23.432
Wait a minute. Where
do they want us to meet?

39:26.897 --> 39:30.633
Of all the sewers on campus, this
one has always been my favorite.

39:30.635 --> 39:32.102
Art, you've been here before?

39:32.104 --> 39:34.104
I have a life outside
of the house, you know.

39:36.775 --> 39:39.676
Welcome to your
worst nightmare,

39:39.678 --> 39:40.910
the Scare Games!

39:44.448 --> 39:45.615
Scare Games! Scare Games!

39:50.388 --> 39:53.123
Yes!
Yes, I love it!

39:53.125 --> 39:54.457
I love this energy!

39:55.493 --> 39:57.827
Okay. Okay, everybody.

39:57.829 --> 40:00.497
Let's hear it for
the frats and sororities

40:00.499 --> 40:02.399
competing in
this year's games...

40:02.401 --> 40:03.767
Jaws Theta Chi!

40:05.937 --> 40:07.737
Python Nu Kappa!

40:07.739 --> 40:08.905
Slugma Slugma Kappa!

40:10.542 --> 40:12.175
Roar Omega Roar!

40:13.678 --> 40:14.944
Eta Hiss Hiss!

40:16.748 --> 40:19.115
And finally, Oozma Kappa.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.587
Yay! Whoo-hoo!

40:25.089 --> 40:27.090
Hi, Mom!

40:27.092 --> 40:28.425
Smile!

40:30.929 --> 40:32.495
Let's begin
the first competition,

40:32.497 --> 40:33.863
the Toxicity Challenge!

40:35.500 --> 40:38.968
Human children are toxic!

40:38.970 --> 40:42.672
And anything
they touch is toxic.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.741
We don't have any human toys,

40:44.743 --> 40:47.110
but thanks to MU's
biology department,

40:47.112 --> 40:48.645
we found a close second,

40:50.481 --> 40:51.721
the stinging glow urchin!

40:54.753 --> 40:56.052
Trust me when I say,

40:56.054 --> 40:57.921
you are not gonna want
to touch this bad boy!

40:57.923 --> 40:59.856
I want to touch it.

40:59.858 --> 41:02.178
And you certainly don't want
to touch any of its friends.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.464
Yeah, I want to touch them.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.632
This is the starting line.

41:09.634 --> 41:12.969
The light at the end of the
tunnel is the finish line.

41:12.971 --> 41:16.291
And whoever comes in last
is eliminated from the games.

41:17.241 --> 41:19.476
Mike...
What is it?

41:19.478 --> 41:20.643
Does that mean if
we lose, we're out?

41:20.645 --> 41:22.145
Don't worry, Smoothie.
Squishy!

41:22.147 --> 41:23.880
Squishy.
We're not going to lose,

41:23.882 --> 41:26.883
because we have everything
we need to win right here.

41:27.785 --> 41:29.519
Heart.

41:29.521 --> 41:30.987
No! Me. I'm going to
win the race for us.

41:30.989 --> 41:33.756
All right, all right.
That's very cute,

41:33.758 --> 41:37.827
It's an obstacle course. What
are you going to do? Roar at it?

41:37.829 --> 41:38.795
I can get through faster
than you, little guy.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.566
Take your place at
the starting line!

41:43.568 --> 41:45.568
This is all about teamwork.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.117
Everybody, stick together.

41:48.939 --> 41:51.074
I'm going to beat you
over that finish line.

41:51.076 --> 41:52.775
Get ready to eat my dust.

41:52.777 --> 41:55.144
Hey, guys, should we huddle up?

41:55.146 --> 41:58.047
Attention, teams.
One last thing.

41:58.049 --> 41:59.649
Scarers work in the dark.

42:06.223 --> 42:08.103
I want to go home!
On your marks...

42:08.692 --> 42:10.693
Hey, uh, good luck, ladies.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.862
Thanks! We're going to
rip you to pieces!

42:12.864 --> 42:14.664
What?

42:16.601 --> 42:17.121
get set...

42:19.136 --> 42:21.170
Go!

42:21.172 --> 42:22.412
I'm going to touch them!

42:34.184 --> 42:35.752
Ow!

42:35.754 --> 42:36.794
Come on!

42:40.024 --> 42:41.891
Uh, guys! We're falling
behind a little! Fellas!

42:43.261 --> 42:45.695
Cheese and crackers!

42:45.697 --> 42:47.297
Son of a moustache!

42:47.299 --> 42:49.599
Salisbury steak, that hurts!

42:49.601 --> 42:50.900
Is that as fast as you can go?

42:50.902 --> 42:52.622
Just getting started!
What the...

42:55.940 --> 42:57.061
Whoa! Ah!

42:57.341 --> 42:58.641
Oh... Ah!

42:59.945 --> 43:01.105
That's got to hurt!

43:05.282 --> 43:07.283
Ow, ow, ow...

43:07.285 --> 43:08.985
Ooh!
Terry!

43:08.987 --> 43:10.587
Don't worry, we'll be fi...

43:24.268 --> 43:25.602
Ha-ha!

43:26.971 --> 43:28.671
Oh...

43:28.673 --> 43:30.173
Uh-oh. Yikes!

43:30.175 --> 43:31.941
Ow! Ow, ow, ow...

43:37.048 --> 43:38.014
Roar Omega Roar wins!

43:52.262 --> 43:54.330
Take that, Wazowski!

43:54.332 --> 43:56.199
Are you delirious?
I beat you!

43:56.201 --> 43:57.200
Get your eye checked!

43:58.268 --> 43:59.969
Oh, way to blow it, Oozmas!

43:59.971 --> 44:01.738
Hey! Second place
ain't bad.

44:01.740 --> 44:02.905
Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!

44:02.907 --> 44:04.974
What?

44:04.976 --> 44:07.176
Your whole team has to
cross the finish line.

44:07.178 --> 44:08.211
Third place, EEKs!

44:08.213 --> 44:09.779
- Fourth place, PNKs!
- No.

44:09.781 --> 44:10.913
Fifth place, HSS!

44:10.915 --> 44:12.315
No, no, no!

44:12.317 --> 44:13.049
And in last place,

44:14.184 --> 44:15.818
Oozma Kappa.

44:17.988 --> 44:20.468
I can't feel my anything.

44:21.258 --> 44:23.893
Oh... Shocker! Oozma Kappa
has been eliminated!

44:24.762 --> 44:26.129
No.

44:29.968 --> 44:33.169
Don't look so surprised,
Mr. Wazowski.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.405
It would have taken
a miracle for you to...

44:35.407 --> 44:38.441
Attention, everyone.
We have an announcement.

44:38.443 --> 44:40.943
Jaws Theta Chi has
been disqualified.

44:43.682 --> 44:46.883
The use of illegal protective
gel is cause for elimination.

44:46.885 --> 44:47.950
What!

44:51.790 --> 44:54.190
Which means Oozma Kappa
is back in the games!

44:54.725 --> 44:55.992
It's a miracle!

44:57.361 --> 45:00.263
Your luck will
run out, eventually.

45:07.438 --> 45:09.798
This is going to be
harder than I thought.

45:13.377 --> 45:15.878
Okay!
Listen up, Oozmas.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.346
Now, we're going to have to start
winning these things together,

45:17.348 --> 45:19.248
so that means I'm going to need

45:19.250 --> 45:20.783
each of you guys
to pull your own weight.

45:20.785 --> 45:22.418
Mike?
What is it?

45:22.420 --> 45:24.954
We've made a list of our
strengths and weaknesses.

45:24.956 --> 45:27.790
In high school, I was the
master of the silent scare.

45:27.792 --> 45:29.792
I could sneak up
on a field mouse

45:29.794 --> 45:30.893
in a pillow factory.

45:32.464 --> 45:34.625
Sorry! They get stickier
when I'm sweaty.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.867
Oh, my gosh, that's terrible.

45:37.869 --> 45:41.110
We're experts in the ancient
craft of close-up magic.

45:42.840 --> 45:45.041
It's all about misdirection.

45:46.777 --> 45:48.411
Uh...

45:48.413 --> 45:49.812
I have an extra toe.

45:49.814 --> 45:52.181
Not with me, of course.

45:52.183 --> 45:54.250
Guys, one slip-up on the
next event, and we're goners.

45:54.252 --> 45:56.152
So for this to work,

45:56.154 --> 45:58.254
I'm gonna need you to take
every instinct you have

45:58.256 --> 45:59.656
and bury it deep, deep down.

45:59.857 --> 46:01.224
Done.

46:01.226 --> 46:02.058
From now on,
we are of one mind.

46:02.060 --> 46:03.192
My mind.

46:03.194 --> 46:05.194
Oh, please.

46:05.196 --> 46:07.296
I will tell you exactly
what to do, and how to do it.

46:07.298 --> 46:09.132
Uh... Okay, Mike.
Seems about right.

46:09.134 --> 46:10.933
All right.
Give me scary steps.

46:10.935 --> 46:12.935
Fifty up and down,
right now. Let's go!

46:12.937 --> 46:15.438
You're wasting your time.
We need a new team.

46:15.440 --> 46:18.341
We can't just "get a new team"!

46:18.343 --> 46:20.810
I checked this morning.
It's against the rules.

46:20.812 --> 46:22.245
What if we disguised a new
team to look like the old team?

46:22.247 --> 46:24.147
Oh, no, no.
We are not cheating.

46:24.149 --> 46:26.249
It's not cheating.
I'm just, you know,

46:26.251 --> 46:27.491
leveling the playing field.

46:30.154 --> 46:32.255
Okay, so it's kind of cheating,
but what do you want me to do?

46:32.257 --> 46:34.423
They're not exactly the
scariest group in the world.

46:34.425 --> 46:37.505
Oh, a ladybug! Make a wish! Make a wish!

46:41.098 --> 46:42.899
This is not going to work.

46:42.901 --> 46:44.200
Where are you going?
We're training.

46:44.202 --> 46:46.002
I'm a Sullivan.

46:46.004 --> 46:47.837
That's not enough.
You're all over the place.

46:47.839 --> 46:48.938
You're charging
ahead when you...

46:48.940 --> 46:50.239
Bup, bup, bup!

46:50.241 --> 46:52.241
You tell them what
to do but not me.

46:52.243 --> 46:53.576
So long, Coach.

46:57.948 --> 46:59.048
Okay, Oozmas...

47:00.117 --> 47:01.884
Boy, we need to get you a bell.

47:01.886 --> 47:05.388
Listen up. "If a kid hears you
coming, they'll call Mom or Dad,

47:05.390 --> 47:06.889
"then you'd better run fast
or things will get bad. "

47:07.324 --> 47:09.158
Huh?

47:09.160 --> 47:10.493
In the next event, if
even one of us gets caught,

47:10.495 --> 47:12.461
we're all out.

47:12.463 --> 47:14.583
So remember,
do exactly what I do.

47:25.309 --> 47:27.510
We are at the halfway point
of the second event,

47:27.512 --> 47:29.378
and things are
getting interesting.

47:33.317 --> 47:34.317
Got it.

47:36.053 --> 47:36.854
Only two teams left.

47:38.021 --> 47:39.455
Who will make it
out with their flag,

47:39.457 --> 47:41.457
and who will be eliminated?

47:41.459 --> 47:45.528
you do not want to get
caught by a kid's parent.

47:45.530 --> 47:48.264
And in this event, you do
not want to get caught by

47:48.266 --> 47:49.265
the librarian.

47:52.469 --> 47:54.170
Quiet.

47:57.241 --> 47:59.042
What's so scary about
a little old librarian?

48:08.318 --> 48:10.286
I said, "Quiet. "

48:35.145 --> 48:37.246
Faster.
Slow and steady.

48:37.248 --> 48:38.915
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.

48:38.917 --> 48:41.317
Slow and steady.

49:01.471 --> 49:04.760
Sullivan!
Sullivan!

49:11.648 --> 49:12.569
Hmm.

49:19.122 --> 49:20.423
Whew!

49:28.665 --> 49:30.066
Ooh!

49:42.012 --> 49:43.245
No!

49:52.089 --> 49:54.390
Five, six, seven, eight!

49:54.392 --> 49:56.225
Look over here!

50:02.632 --> 50:04.567
Is that legal? You better
believe it, mop top!

50:04.569 --> 50:07.003
The only rule is
don't get caught.

50:09.506 --> 50:10.773
Whoo!

50:17.280 --> 50:18.381
- Ooh!
- Hey! Over here!

50:22.620 --> 50:24.053
Come and get me! Come
and get me! Whoo-hoo!

50:24.055 --> 50:25.321
Guys, what are you doing?

50:25.323 --> 50:26.322
They said don't
let her catch you.

50:26.324 --> 50:28.391
But they didn't say how!

50:28.393 --> 50:30.873
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Come on!

50:33.797 --> 50:34.663
Whoa!

50:36.601 --> 50:37.666
Whew!

50:37.668 --> 50:39.402
We did it!

50:39.404 --> 50:41.737
No, we didn't.
We forgot the flag!

50:41.739 --> 50:42.705
Mike?

50:45.642 --> 50:46.776
Way to go, Squishy!
Way to go, Squishy!

50:47.244 --> 50:48.511
How?

50:48.513 --> 50:50.312
Misdirection.

50:57.255 --> 50:59.321
The EEKs have been eliminated

50:59.323 --> 51:03.426
and Oozma Kappa live
to scare another day!

51:03.428 --> 51:05.728
We're OK! We're OK!
We're OK!

51:11.068 --> 51:12.435
I've never felt so alive!

51:12.437 --> 51:13.769
We were awesome!

51:13.771 --> 51:16.605
Okay, look.
That wasn't real Scaring.

51:16.607 --> 51:17.773
It was better
than what you did.

51:17.775 --> 51:18.674
You should've
stuck to my strategy.

51:19.209 --> 51:20.643
Whatever.

51:20.645 --> 51:22.365
Talk to me when we start
the real Scaring.

51:23.748 --> 51:26.615
Hey! You guys
going to the party?

51:26.617 --> 51:28.484
Oh, I think you've
got the wrong guys.

51:28.486 --> 51:30.486
- We don't get invited to...
- Party?

51:30.488 --> 51:32.721
The mid-games mixer
at the RORs'.

51:32.723 --> 51:34.490
It's for the top Scare Teams.

51:34.492 --> 51:36.053
You're one of us now, right?

51:36.726 --> 51:37.886
See you there!

51:39.397 --> 51:41.464
Did you hear that?
I can't believe it!

51:41.466 --> 51:43.766
Uh-uh. Bad idea.
This is great.

51:43.768 --> 51:46.608
They're finally seeing us
as real Scarers. We're going!

51:50.507 --> 51:52.541
Do young people still dance?

51:52.543 --> 51:54.210
Because my moves
are a little rusty.

51:54.212 --> 51:56.378
Oh, we forgot to
bring a hostess gift.

51:56.380 --> 51:57.880
We can't go in there
without some scented candles.

51:57.882 --> 52:01.383
Calm down.
We earned this.

52:01.385 --> 52:02.785
What if there's a lull
in the conversation?

52:02.787 --> 52:04.553
I never know what
to... You know...

52:04.555 --> 52:05.888
Say?

52:05.890 --> 52:07.890
How are you so good at this?

52:07.892 --> 52:09.692
You just took on
an angry 50-foot librarian,

52:09.694 --> 52:11.594
and you're afraid
of a little party?

52:11.596 --> 52:13.162
Take a deep breath...

52:14.198 --> 52:15.238
and in you go!

52:23.740 --> 52:24.640
Hello.

52:25.509 --> 52:26.775
It's Oozma Kappa!

52:26.777 --> 52:28.177
These guys are crazy!

52:28.179 --> 52:30.279
What you did today was insane!

52:30.281 --> 52:31.814
That was awesome!

52:36.153 --> 52:38.874
Oozma Kappa, tonight
we party like Scarers!

53:01.478 --> 53:03.746
I've never stayed up
this late in my life!

54:15.952 --> 54:17.987
Hey, quiet! Quiet!

54:19.256 --> 54:21.457
Quiet down,
you can-wranglers.

54:21.459 --> 54:23.892
All right.
On behalf of the RORs,

54:23.894 --> 54:26.974
we'd like to congratulate all the
teams that have made it this far.

54:29.033 --> 54:29.698
All, right, let's hear it for the PNKs!

54:31.569 --> 54:33.649
I love that trick!
Never gets old. HSS!

54:35.339 --> 54:36.739
Very creepy.

54:36.741 --> 54:40.042
And finally, the surprise
team of the Scare Games,

54:41.378 --> 54:41.944
Oozma Kappa!

54:42.712 --> 54:44.426
Come on over, guys.

54:45.982 --> 54:47.916
Now, I got to admit, fellas,

54:47.918 --> 54:49.918
I thought you were
a bunch of nobodies.

54:50.754 --> 54:52.655
But, boy, was I wrong.

54:52.657 --> 54:54.690
Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa!

54:54.692 --> 54:56.558
Oozma Kappa!

54:56.560 --> 54:57.593
Oh!

54:59.429 --> 55:00.863
What?

55:00.865 --> 55:03.499
The most adorable
monsters on campus.

55:05.935 --> 55:08.337
Ooh! Oh!

55:13.076 --> 55:14.637
Release the stuffed animals.

55:19.016 --> 55:19.856
Faced!

55:24.888 --> 55:28.557
- Don't worry.
- Nobody reads the school paper.

55:28.559 --> 55:32.079
Yeah, but I'm pretty
sure they read the quad.

55:42.072 --> 55:43.005
Whoo-hoo!

55:48.611 --> 55:50.012
Thank you very much.

55:50.014 --> 55:51.080
Okay. Would you like that
with two sleeves or four?

55:51.082 --> 55:52.403
Thanks.
Tell your friends.

55:53.650 --> 55:55.484
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

55:55.486 --> 55:56.652
Raising a little
money for charity.

55:56.654 --> 55:58.687
Yeah? Well, stop it.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.556
You want us to stop raising money
for charity? That's not cool.

56:00.558 --> 56:02.858
This guy hates charity!

56:02.860 --> 56:05.627
I want you to stop
making us look like fools.

56:05.629 --> 56:08.364
Hey, you're making yourselves
look like fools.

56:08.366 --> 56:09.998
Let's be honest, boys.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
You're never going
to be real Scarers,

56:12.002 --> 56:14.703
because real Scarers
look like us.

56:17.074 --> 56:20.709
But, hey, if you really want
to work for a Scare company

56:20.711 --> 56:22.911
they're always
hiring in the mailroom.

56:28.818 --> 56:29.698
Guys, hold on!

56:31.421 --> 56:34.056
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a
second. Don't listen to him.

56:34.058 --> 56:35.691
We just need to keep trying.

56:35.693 --> 56:37.993
No, you need to stop trying!

56:37.995 --> 56:40.529
You can train monsters
like this all you want,

56:40.531 --> 56:42.732
but you can't
change who they are.

56:47.637 --> 56:49.671
Mike...

56:49.673 --> 56:52.673
We appreciate everything
you've done, but he's right.

56:55.044 --> 56:58.080
No matter how much we train,
we'll never look like them.

57:00.850 --> 57:01.971
We're built

57:03.520 --> 57:04.760
for other things.

57:16.834 --> 57:18.467
Sorry, squirt!

57:18.469 --> 57:20.670
Some monsters just aren't
cut out for the big leagues.

57:24.073 --> 57:25.154
The big leagues.

57:26.042 --> 57:26.909
Guys.

57:29.112 --> 57:30.953
We're going on
a little field trip.

57:40.658 --> 57:42.558
My tentacle fell asleep.

57:42.560 --> 57:44.159
Thanks, Mom.
Have fun, kids!

57:44.161 --> 57:46.462
I'll just be here
listening to my tunes.

57:51.601 --> 57:53.936
Hey, uh, where are we?

57:53.938 --> 57:55.070
The big leagues.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.180
Holy roly-poly.

58:05.182 --> 58:06.482
Wow.

58:06.484 --> 58:08.083
Nice fence.

58:08.085 --> 58:09.251
This is amazing, Mike.

58:10.487 --> 58:11.620
We're not stopping here.

58:25.535 --> 58:27.255
This is crazy.
We're going to get arrested!

58:33.176 --> 58:34.276
Oh, wow.

58:34.278 --> 58:35.544
Whoa...

58:35.546 --> 58:37.079
Oh!

58:37.081 --> 58:39.248
<i>All Scare Floors now activ.</i>

58:39.250 --> 58:42.217
<i>West coast coming online.
Scarers coming out.</i>

58:44.587 --> 58:46.054
Look at them.

58:46.056 --> 58:47.656
They're going
into the human world,

58:47.658 --> 58:49.538
and they don't
even look scared!

58:52.929 --> 58:54.196
Wow.

58:54.198 --> 58:56.832
Take a good look, fellas.

58:56.834 --> 58:58.195
See what they
all have in common?

59:00.970 --> 59:03.071
Uh... No, not really.

59:03.073 --> 59:07.009
Exactly. There's no
one type of Scarer.

59:07.011 --> 59:09.371
The best Scarers use their
differences to their advantage.

59:10.847 --> 59:12.581
Wow.

59:12.583 --> 59:14.016
Terri? Look.

59:19.155 --> 59:20.856
Hey!

59:20.858 --> 59:23.559
Look at that old feller
racking up the big numbers!

59:23.561 --> 59:26.662
Don, that old fella is
Earl "The Terror" Thompson!

59:26.664 --> 59:29.298
What? Where?
That's really him?

59:29.300 --> 59:31.633
He held the Scare
Record for three years!

59:31.635 --> 59:33.769
Oh! Third door from the end!

59:33.771 --> 59:36.138
Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez!

59:36.140 --> 59:38.640
Look! It's
"Screaming" Bob Gunderson!

59:38.642 --> 59:40.309
I still have his rookie card.
Me, too!

59:40.311 --> 59:41.810
Doesn't have the speed anymore, but his

59:41.812 --> 59:43.973
technique is flawless.
Technique is flawless.

59:45.248 --> 59:46.882
You collected Scare Cards, huh?

59:46.884 --> 59:49.151
Yep. 450 of them.

59:49.153 --> 59:52.020
Impressive. I have 6,000
still in mint condition,

59:52.022 --> 59:53.822
but, you know,
450 is pretty good, too.

59:53.824 --> 59:55.891
Hey, look at me! I'm Earl
"The Terror" Thompson!

59:55.893 --> 59:57.025
Whoa!

59:57.027 --> 59:59.161
Oh, that's great!

59:59.163 --> 01:00:00.696
That's
a pretty good one, Squish.

01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:05.901
I've been a real jerk.

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:08.704
So have I.

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:12.347
But it's not too late.

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:15.844
We could be a great team.

01:00:15.846 --> 01:00:18.007
We just need to
start working together.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:20.882
Hey!

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:22.884
What are you doing up there?

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.153
I can't go back to jail!

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:30.726
Come on!

01:00:30.728 --> 01:00:31.927
They're right behind us!

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:36.832
Get back here!

01:00:43.841 --> 01:00:45.374
Up there! Get them!

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:47.242
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:50.866
Thanks, brother!
Don't mention it.

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:57.219
I'm fine, really! It's
just a little heart attack.

01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:59.261
Aw... I want
a piece of that action!

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.367
Mom! Start the car!

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.904
What?
Start the car!

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:17.439
Stop the bar?

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:19.441
The car! Start the car!

01:01:19.443 --> 01:01:21.076
Oh! Okay.

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:24.312
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:25.947
Get in! Get in!

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:28.029
Mom, go!
Seatbelts.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:29.951
Okay, go!

01:01:29.953 --> 01:01:30.952
Does anyone want gum?

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:31.875
Just drive!

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:34.029
Okay. Here we go!

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:41.730
Oh, yeah!
Let's break in somewhere else!

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.989
Rise and shine!

01:02:07.991 --> 01:02:10.726
Scary feet, scary feet...
The kid is in the bathroom!

01:02:10.728 --> 01:02:12.368
Scary feet, scary feet...
Oh, he's back!

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:15.797
Wake up!

01:02:15.799 --> 01:02:17.499
Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight!

01:02:17.501 --> 01:02:19.067
Do I hear thirty-nine?

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:20.769
Come on!

01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:22.572
Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa,
you're looking good.

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:26.007
"To frighten a child
is the point of a Scare.

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:29.010
"If you frighten a teen,
then Scarer beware. "

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:30.133
Okay, scare the little kid.

01:02:31.482 --> 01:02:32.280
Avoid the teenager!

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.155
I'm on the phone!

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:42.424
No one understands me!

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:44.960
Whatever.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.100
But, Daddy, I love him!

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:00.809
<i>- First place,
- Roar Omega Roar!</i>

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:02.544
<i>Second place, Oozma Kappa!</i>

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:04.479
Whoo!

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:05.814
<i>Third place, HSS.</i>

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:10.552
You're lame.

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:15.123
"Someone is coming, this
could ruin your night.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.192
"Stay hidden, take cover,
and stay out of sight!"

01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:18.714
You got 10 seconds.
Go!

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:25.066
Kiosk! Pile of leaves!
Standing out in the open.

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:26.268
And there should be one more.

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:28.837
How did I do?

01:03:28.839 --> 01:03:30.205
Oh! Not too
shabby, Don!

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:33.041
Thanks!
I cannot get down.

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:34.242
Zombie snarl!

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:36.378
Angry poodle.
Jazz clown.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.245
My Aunt Phyllis.

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:38.547
In the morning.

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:40.750
That's what I'm talking about!

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:51.960
Time to go to work.

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:14.249
You're out!

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:17.333
You're out.

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:21.230
Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:34.202
Thank you.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:39.107
Yeah!

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:41.243
Yeah!

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.645
<i>We're down to o remaining team,</i>

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:46.207
<i>Roar Omega Rr and Oozma Ka!</i>

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:51.152
Which leads us to
the final event!

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:54.055
"Every one of your skills
will be put to the test.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:57.459
"The Scare Simulator will
prove who's the best!"

01:04:57.461 --> 01:05:00.061
Tomorrow night
you finally get to Scare

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.897
in front of the whole school!

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:05.133
Enjoy the attention
while it lasts, boys.

01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:08.637
After you lose,
no one will remember you.

01:05:08.639 --> 01:05:11.940
Maybe. But when you lose, no
one will let you forget it.

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:16.244
Oh, boy. That is
a good point.

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:19.547
Hey, Oozmas,
you guys are awesome!

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:21.650
You've got to
teach us your moves.

01:05:21.652 --> 01:05:24.552
Well, then you're gonna
want to talk to this guy.

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:26.521
Oh...
Sure, I can teach you.

01:05:26.523 --> 01:05:28.290
All right. You want to
hide behind the chair?

01:05:28.292 --> 01:05:30.292
You have to become the chair.

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:31.359
Thanks for coming, Dean.

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:35.163
Dean Hardscrabble!

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:37.632
If we get back into
the Scaring program,

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:39.994
I hope there's
no hard feelings.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:44.139
Tomorrow,
each of you must prove

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:46.207
that you are undeniably scary.

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:50.979
And I know for a fact
that one of you is not.

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:58.954
No. He works
harder than anyone.

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:00.488
Do you think he's scary?

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:02.057
He's the heart and
soul of the team!

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:03.491
Do you think he's scary?

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:19.441
We're going to win this thing
tomorrow, Sull, I can feel it!

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:21.684
We'll finally have
our lives back on track.

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:24.612
Hey, Mike?

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:27.682
You know, you've given me
a lot of really great tips.

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:30.085
I'd love to return
the favor sometime.

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:32.207
Oh. Yeah, sure.
Anytime.

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:36.157
We're doing this now?
Okay.

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:37.359
You've memorized
every textbook,

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:39.260
every Scare Theory,
and that is great.

01:06:39.262 --> 01:06:40.729
Hey!

01:06:40.731 --> 01:06:42.664
But now it's time
to forget all that.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.734
Just reach deep down
and let the scary out!

01:06:45.736 --> 01:06:47.635
Huh. Just feel it.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:49.537
Exactly. Go wild.

01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:51.499
I don't know. I've kind of
got my own technique.

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:52.795
Give it a try.

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:56.111
Good, but bigger!

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:58.713
Nope. You're thinking again.

01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:00.482
From the gut!

01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:01.449
Let the animal out!

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.760
Come on! Dig deep!

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:09.024
Boys!
It's a school night!

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:13.028
So, how was that?

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.258
Up top.
Ha-ha!

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.134
You know,
it did feel different!

01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:20.802
I feel like it's
all coming together.

01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:23.438
Yup, this time tomorrow the whole
school is finally going to see

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.373
what Mike Wazowski can do.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:26.541
You're darn right.

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:35.817

Okay, just like we planned.
I'll go first. Then, Don...

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:28.103
Hold on. Mike's the one
who started all this

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.545
and I think it's only right if
he's the one who finishes it.

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:31.827
I think you should go last.

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:33.508
Yes!

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:34.591
Yeah, Mike. Finish strong!

01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:38.580
All right. Don,
you okay going first?

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:40.348
I guess I'm as ready
as I'll ever be.

01:08:41.216 --> 01:08:43.618
Oozma Kappa!

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.386
Go Oozmas!

01:08:45.388 --> 01:08:47.221
I'm gonna do it. I'm
going to beat this guy.

01:08:47.224 --> 01:08:49.858
Hey, Bruiser! You take
it easy on grandpa.

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:53.127
Unleash the beast, Don!

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.162
Okay, then.

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:43.837
Huh? Huh?

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.649
Thanks for taking
it easy on grandpa.

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.050
<i>Next group to
the starting line.</i>

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:57.825
Let's do this.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:07.535
Yes! Yeah!

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.293
Come on, Art.
Come on, buddy.

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:32.894
You can do it.

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:45.640
Yes!

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:48.910
Aw!

<i>Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!</i>

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:07.362
You got this, Sull.

01:11:32.055 --> 01:11:34.589
<i>And it's all tied up!</i>

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.992
<i>Ah! Tough break
for the RORs.</i>

01:11:37.994 --> 01:11:39.795
Huh?
Hearts?

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.329
Huh?

01:11:41.331 --> 01:11:42.051
Way to go, Boggs!

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:45.833
Yay!

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:50.905
That's the last time
I lose to you, Sullivan.

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:53.441
<i>Worthington and Wazowski,
to the starting line.</i>

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:01.049
Hey.

01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:03.212
Don't worry about Hardscrabble.

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:06.054
Don't worry about anyone else.

01:12:06.056 --> 01:12:09.496
Just go out there and show
them what Mike Wazowski can do.

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:12.060
Thanks.

01:12:22.439 --> 01:12:24.706
Don't take the loss too hard.

01:12:24.708 --> 01:12:25.988
You never belonged here anyway.

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:59.040
<i>Amazing
performance by Worthington!</i>

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.522
- Johnny, you're my hero!
- ROR! ROR!

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:04.612
<i>The Oozmas
will need a record-breakg</i>

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:06.080
<i>Scare to win this.</i>

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:10.585
<i>You don't belong
on a Scare Floor.</i>

01:13:10.587 --> 01:13:13.087
<i>You're not scary.</i>

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:15.390
<i>Come on! Dig deep!</i>

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.431
Yeah!

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:28.503
<i>They did it!</i>

01:13:46.655 --> 01:13:48.623
Yeah! Hey!

01:13:50.493 --> 01:13:52.827
We're in the Scare
program! Yeah!

01:13:57.466 --> 01:13:59.066
Come here, you son of a gun!

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:00.468
Way to go!

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:01.803
Yeah!

01:14:01.805 --> 01:14:03.671
Oh! A little stuck.

01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:05.106
Pardon me there,
Ms. Squibbles.

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:07.108
It's Sherrie.

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:10.945
We did it!

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:17.018
Way to go, Oozma Kappa!

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:17.952
Thank you!
Thanks a lot.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.720
You rule!

01:14:19.722 --> 01:14:21.222
I have never ruled before.

01:14:21.224 --> 01:14:22.890
You guys killed it out there!

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:24.025
Awesome!

01:14:24.027 --> 01:14:25.626
Hey, Wazowski!

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.463
Come on, let's go, you
maniac! We're celebrating.

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:31.532
Mike?

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:33.134
I did it.

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:35.937
I can't believe it.

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:40.107
I'm going to be a Scarer!

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:41.843
Yeah, yes, you are.

01:14:41.845 --> 01:14:43.945
You hear that? Get
plenty of rest, kiddo.

01:14:43.947 --> 01:14:46.814
You haven't seen the last
of Mike Wazowski. Boo!

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:57.792
I knew I was scary. I
didn't know I was that scary.

01:14:57.794 --> 01:14:59.894
Yeah, we're so scary
I guess we broke it.

01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:00.995
Come on.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.176
It's been tampered with.

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.218
Uh, I don't think you
should be messing with that.

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:19.580
Why are my settings different?

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:21.516
Mike, we should leave.

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:24.986
Did you do this?
Mike.

01:15:24.988 --> 01:15:26.721
Did you do this?

01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:27.788
I...

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:32.660
Yes, I did.
But you don't understand.

01:15:32.662 --> 01:15:35.162
Why? Why did you do this?

01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:37.164
You know, just in case.

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:38.247
In case of what?

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:42.376
You don't think I'm scary.

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:44.205
Mike...

01:15:44.207 --> 01:15:46.247
You said you believed in me.

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:47.742
But you're just
like Hardscrabble.

01:15:47.744 --> 01:15:49.243
You're just like everyone else!

01:15:49.245 --> 01:15:50.678
Look, you'll get
better and better...

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.080
I'm as scary as you!
I'm as scary as anyone!

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:54.982
I just wanted to help.
No.

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:56.684
You just wanted
to help yourself.

01:15:56.686 --> 01:15:59.654
Let the whole team fail
because you don't have it?

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:35.022
So your calculations
were a little off.

01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:37.224
That door took me all semester.

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:39.626
It's too dangerous. The
professor's just going to shred it.

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:49.870
There he is, the big guy.

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:52.232
The first of many
trophies, I am sure.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:54.275
Sullivan.

01:16:55.043 --> 01:16:57.078
Nice work out there.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.840
I look forward to
having you back in class.

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:01.282
Hey, there he is!

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:05.219
Looks like I was
wrong about you.

01:17:05.221 --> 01:17:07.121
You're one of us after all.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:09.290
Way to go, Sulley!
Welcome back, broham!

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:13.160
You are one of us now, okay?

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:14.895
Anytime you want
to come hang out

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:16.218
and do whatever,
you got a crew.

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:19.166
You're a ROR, buddy!

01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:20.067
Hey!

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:22.343
Where are you going?

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:38.219
You did what?

01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:39.820
My team had
nothing to do with it.

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:42.156
It was all me. I cheated.

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.660
I expect you off
campus by tomorrow.

01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:48.062
Yes, ma'am.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:51.165
You're a disgrace
to this university

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:54.435
and your family name.

01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:01.342
What's going on?

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:02.877
Someone broke
into the door lab!

01:18:02.879 --> 01:18:03.711
What?

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:07.889
Oh, no.

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:16.564
Open the door!
Don't go in there!

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:56.704
You look funny.

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:00.101
What?

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:08.075
I'm so tired.
What's going on?

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:09.638
It's the middle of the night.

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:11.172
A little funny green guy.

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:25.760
I want to touch it!
It's so cute!

01:19:29.298 --> 01:19:30.297
James!

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:36.303
No one goes near that door
until the authorities arrive.

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:37.238
You don't think
that could be...

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.372
It's Mike.

01:19:38.374 --> 01:19:39.614
But he could die out there!

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:44.812
James, wait!
We can help.

01:19:44.814 --> 01:19:48.983
Leave it to
the old master of sales.

01:19:48.985 --> 01:19:49.517
We got a call in, but
that's the best we can do.

01:19:49.519 --> 01:19:51.285
Ahem!

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:55.289
Don Carlton, sales. Folks,
today is your lucky day.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.491
How many times have you asked
yourself the following question...

01:19:57.493 --> 01:19:59.213
Arrest him.
Pardon?

01:20:00.062 --> 01:20:01.428
Spread them, pops!

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:02.897
Do you mind?
Don't move!

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:04.298
What? Sullivan!

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.065
Don't you dare!

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:07.328
Sullivan! Don't go in there!

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:15.910
Mike?

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.413
Mike!

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:21.282
The kids said they saw
something in the cabin.

01:20:21.284 --> 01:20:22.216
They're calling it an alien.

01:20:22.218 --> 01:20:23.818
It was!

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.085
I saw a little green guy!

01:20:25.087 --> 01:20:27.021
What's the problem, ma'am?

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:35.129
Mike?

01:20:38.968 --> 01:20:40.401
Bear! A bear in the camp!

01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:41.883
Call this in to headquarters.

01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:51.378
Down this way.
All right?

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:59.219
I heard something over here!

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:02.857
Mike!

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.300
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you out of here.

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:15.369
This is all my fault.
I'm sorry.

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:21.106
You were right. They
weren't scared of me.

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:26.213
I did everything right.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:28.215
I wanted it more than anyone.

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:33.120
And I thought... I thought
if I wanted it enough,

01:21:33.122 --> 01:21:35.162
I could show everybody that...

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:37.958
That Mike Wazowski
is something special.

01:21:40.595 --> 01:21:41.896
And I'm just

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:44.598
not.

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:53.974
Look, Mike,
I know how you feel.

01:21:53.976 --> 01:21:55.576
Don't do that!
Please, don't do that!

01:21:55.578 --> 01:21:57.011
You do not know how I feel.

01:21:57.013 --> 01:21:58.979
Mike, calm down.

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:01.081
Monsters like you have everything.
You don't have to be good.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.350
You can mess up
over and over again

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:05.085
and the whole world loves you.
Mike...

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.453
You'll never know
what it's like to fail

01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:08.355
because you were
born a Sullivan!

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:09.690
Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.

01:22:09.692 --> 01:22:11.525
I'm the Sullivan
who flunked every test.

01:22:11.527 --> 01:22:13.294
The one who got kicked out
of the program,

01:22:13.296 --> 01:22:15.362
the one who was so afraid
to let everyone down

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:17.064
that I cheated.

01:22:17.066 --> 01:22:18.106
And I lied.

01:22:22.238 --> 01:22:24.399
Mike, I'll never know
how you feel,

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:28.168
but you're not
the only failure here.

01:22:32.247 --> 01:22:36.183
I act scary, Mike,
but most of the time

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.119
I'm terrified.

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:53.668
How come you never
told me that before?

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:56.484
Because

01:22:58.106 --> 01:22:59.640
we weren't friends before.

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:06.580
Check the lake!

01:23:06.582 --> 01:23:07.503
I heard something here!

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:10.384
This way!

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:17.658
I saw movement!

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:19.340
Over there!

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.076
Sulley!

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:44.051
He's cornered!

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:53.427
No!

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:57.231
They're still in there!

01:23:57.233 --> 01:24:00.167
Until the authorities arrive,
this door stays off!

01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:02.803
No! You can't
do that! No!

01:24:02.805 --> 01:24:06.507
Enough! I want
this room cleared now!

01:24:06.509 --> 01:24:07.374
You can't do this!

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:21.641
We got to get out of here!

01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:24.625
Let them come.
What?

01:24:24.627 --> 01:24:26.427
If we scare them,
I mean really scare them,

01:24:26.429 --> 01:24:27.828
we could generate enough scream

01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:29.563
to power the door
from this side!

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:31.165
What are you talking about?

01:24:31.167 --> 01:24:32.299
I have read every book
about Scaring ever written.

01:24:32.301 --> 01:24:33.634
This could work!

01:24:33.636 --> 01:24:35.569
They're adults.
I can't do this.

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:36.971
Yes, you can.
Just follow my lead.

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:09.670
<i>Mama!</i>

01:25:10.371 --> 01:25:12.306
<i>Mama!</i>

01:25:12.308 --> 01:25:13.841
<i>Mama...</i>

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:29.723
What the...

01:25:33.295 --> 01:25:35.529
Now what?
Phase two.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:39.366
Keep together.

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:50.811
Are you ready?

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:52.880
Mike, I can't.
Yes, you can.

01:25:52.882 --> 01:25:55.322
Stop being a Sullivan
and start being you.

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:57.151
Call for backup.

01:25:57.153 --> 01:25:58.519
Assistance on the north side.

01:25:58.521 --> 01:26:01.321
Repeat, we need assistance
on the north side.

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:02.756
<i>Ranger,
answer me, what's your 20?</i>

01:26:02.758 --> 01:26:05.359
We need assistance on the
north side. We have a...

01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:06.260
Look! What was it?

01:26:06.262 --> 01:26:08.595
Let's go.

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:44.631
Sulley, come on!

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:12.226
How?

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:15.623
How did you do this?

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:17.431
Don't ask me.

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.242
Move, move, move! This
is a 54-23 in progress.

01:27:28.244 --> 01:27:29.343
All right,
everybody, clear out.

01:27:29.345 --> 01:27:31.011
Secure the perimeter.

01:27:31.013 --> 01:27:32.646
No child breach.
No child breach.

01:27:33.481 --> 01:27:35.249
You ruined our doors!

01:27:35.251 --> 01:27:37.384
I've been working on
my door all semester!

01:27:37.386 --> 01:27:38.452
Let's go, you two.

01:27:38.454 --> 01:27:39.620
You're alive!

01:27:39.622 --> 01:27:40.743
We are so glad you're safe.

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:45.792
Hey, wait!

01:27:45.794 --> 01:27:50.797
That's for the university
president to decide.

01:27:50.799 --> 01:27:54.434
But you can be sure we'll
be watching these two.

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:55.936
Always watching.

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:02.776
Expelled?

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:04.554
Yeah, we really messed up.

01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:06.847
So, you're leaving?

01:28:06.849 --> 01:28:08.715
Yeah, buddy. We have to go.

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:12.019
Harsh, man.

01:28:12.021 --> 01:28:14.421
I'm sorry, guys. You'd
be in the Scaring program

01:28:14.423 --> 01:28:15.663
right now if it wasn't for us.

01:28:18.393 --> 01:28:20.360
What?

01:28:20.362 --> 01:28:22.562
Well, it is
the gosh-darnedest thing.

01:28:22.564 --> 01:28:23.930
Hardscrabble's letting us
into the Scare program.

01:28:23.932 --> 01:28:25.799
What?

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:27.801
She was impressed with our
performance in the games.

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:30.070
She invited us to
join next semester!

01:28:30.072 --> 01:28:32.873
Congratulations, guys!

01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:34.841
And that's not the
only piece of good news.

01:28:34.843 --> 01:28:36.009
Sherrie and I are engaged!

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:39.713
Oh. Who is Sherrie?

01:28:39.715 --> 01:28:41.615
She's my mom.

01:28:41.617 --> 01:28:44.318
Well, if it isn't my
two favorite fellas!

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:45.786
Come here.
Give me some sugar.

01:28:45.788 --> 01:28:46.553
Oh!

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:49.323
Ugh! So uncomfortable.

01:28:49.325 --> 01:28:51.325
Oh, come on, Scott.

01:28:51.327 --> 01:28:53.527
I don't want you to think
of me as your new dad.

01:28:53.529 --> 01:28:54.961
After all, we're
fraternity brothers first.

01:28:54.963 --> 01:28:56.763
This is so weird.

01:28:56.765 --> 01:28:58.566
Just think of me
as your big brother

01:28:58.567 --> 01:28:59.633
that's marrying your mother.

01:28:59.635 --> 01:29:01.068
Wait. Hold on.

01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:03.970
We're brothers who share
the same mom slash wife.

01:29:03.972 --> 01:29:04.932
That's worse.

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:09.188
Well, I guess
we should be going now.

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:12.479
Promise me
you'll keep in touch.

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:20.946
You're the scariest bunch
of monsters I have ever met.

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:26.752
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:55.088
So, what now?

01:29:57.058 --> 01:30:00.827
You know, for the first time in my
life, I don't really have a plan.

01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:03.397
You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:07.534
I think it's time I leave the
greatness to other monsters.

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:10.570
I'm okay just being okay.

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:21.002
So long, Sull.

01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:23.417
So long.

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:52.179
Wazowski!

01:30:52.181 --> 01:30:53.814
Whoa!
Stop the bus!

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:56.550
Are you crazy?

01:30:57.218 --> 01:30:59.586
Mike,

01:30:59.588 --> 01:31:01.955
I don't know a single Scarer
who can do what you do.

01:31:01.957 --> 01:31:04.458
I know,
everyone sees us together,

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:06.760
they think I'm the one running
the show, but the truth is,

01:31:06.762 --> 01:31:09.863
I've been riding your
coattails since day one!

01:31:09.865 --> 01:31:11.865
You made the deal
with Hardscrabble.

01:31:11.867 --> 01:31:14.034
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.

01:31:14.036 --> 01:31:16.169
All I did was catch a pig!

01:31:16.171 --> 01:31:17.871
Technically, I caught the pig.

01:31:17.873 --> 01:31:21.041
Exactly! And you
think you're just okay?

01:31:21.043 --> 01:31:23.577
You pulled off the biggest
Scare this school has ever seen!

01:31:23.579 --> 01:31:25.745
That wasn't me!
That was you!

01:31:25.747 --> 01:31:27.914
You think I could have
done that without you?

01:31:27.916 --> 01:31:30.197
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.

01:31:32.553 --> 01:31:34.921
Mike, you're not scary.
Not even a little.

01:31:34.923 --> 01:31:36.022
But you are fearless.

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:41.061
And if Hardscrabble can't
see that, then she can just...

01:31:41.063 --> 01:31:42.929
I can just what?

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:48.034
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.970
Sorry.

01:31:50.738 --> 01:31:51.905
Well, gentlemen,

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:56.176
it seems you made
the front page again.

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:01.248
The two of you did
something together

01:32:01.250 --> 01:32:03.010
that no one has
ever done before.

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:05.218
You surprised me.

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:10.891
Perhaps I should keep an
eye out for more surprises

01:32:10.893 --> 01:32:11.958
like you in my program.

01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:16.530
But as far as the two
of you are concerned

01:32:16.532 --> 01:32:18.333
there is nothing
I can do for you now.

01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:22.035
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.

01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:29.943
And, Mr. Wazowski,
keep surprising people.

01:32:40.821 --> 01:32:42.789
You know,
there is still one way

01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:45.191
we can work at a Scare company.

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:50.082
They're always
hiring in the mailroom.

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:56.670
This is better
than I ever imagined!

01:32:56.672 --> 01:32:58.905
I bet we break the all-time
record in our first year.

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:00.941
Mike, we're mail guys.

01:33:00.943 --> 01:33:03.610
I know. I'm talking about the
record for letters delivered!

01:33:05.614 --> 01:33:08.281
All right, newbies,
quit goofing around.

01:33:08.283 --> 01:33:10.584
I'll have you know tampering
with the mail is a crime

01:33:10.586 --> 01:33:12.352
punishable by banishment!
Yes, sir.

01:33:12.354 --> 01:33:14.120
We're right on it,
Mr. Snowman.

01:33:14.122 --> 01:33:15.889
The team of
Wazowski and Sullivan

01:33:15.891 --> 01:33:17.657
are going to change
the world starting today!

01:33:17.659 --> 01:33:18.792
Say scream!

01:33:18.794 --> 01:33:20.794
Scream!
Scream!

01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:05.839
Wazowski, good luck on your first day!

01:34:05.841 --> 01:34:06.940
Thanks, Merv.

01:34:06.942 --> 01:34:07.941
Good luck, Mike!

01:34:07.943 --> 01:34:09.596
Thanks, fellas.

01:34:15.716 --> 01:34:16.783
You coming, Coach?

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:19.653
You better believe it.

01:43:00.674 --> 01:43:02.875
I made it!
My first day of class!

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:07.880
Uh, the school year's
over, son. You missed it.

01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:11.617
Great.
