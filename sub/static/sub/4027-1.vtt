00:20.872 --> 00:23.352
<i>I'm not gonna hold back.</i>

00:23.488 --> 00:26.095
<i>I warned the others
that I wouldn't.</i>

00:26.289 --> 00:30.131
<i>Recording it like this
is so important to us.</i>

00:30.797 --> 00:34.625
<i>I guess it's our way of telling
ourselves that we matter.</i>

00:36.866 --> 00:39.756
<i>That we mean something.</i>

00:39.967 --> 00:42.452
<i>Maybe...</i>

00:43.066 --> 00:45.799
<i>some of the things we've done...</i>

00:46.018 --> 00:49.353
<i>and the friends that we've lost...</i>

00:50.204 --> 00:53.985
<i>hopefully it all makes
a difference somehow.</i>

00:58.806 --> 01:01.602
<i>There's only one way to do this.</i>

01:01.703 --> 01:05.327
<i>And that's to go back
to where it all began.</i>

02:16.240 --> 02:18.699
What, with Kevin? When?

02:18.849 --> 02:21.518
Last night. He came over
to help with the shearing.

02:21.619 --> 02:24.075
Some sheep got out
and dad went after them.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.577
We were all by ourselves
for, like, 20 minutes.

02:26.678 --> 02:30.497
You did it in a shearing shed?
- In the bed of soft pure merino wool.

02:30.598 --> 02:32.982
My God, you're such a nimpho.

02:33.127 --> 02:36.757
You can talk, Ellie. What about you
and Steve at rehearsals last year.

02:36.857 --> 02:40.258
Oh please, we never went that far.
- Now... pinky swear not to tell.

02:40.369 --> 02:44.154
Pinky swear? Is that not something
we stopped doing in second grade?

02:44.255 --> 02:47.604
<i>Corrie's been my best mate
for as long as I can remember.</i>

02:47.705 --> 02:50.165
<i>Whenever I had a problem,
I'd go tell Corrie</i>

02:50.267 --> 02:53.066
<i>and somehow, she'd always fix it.</i>

02:53.683 --> 02:57.840
So, how was it?
- Well, not how I expected.

02:58.141 --> 03:01.741
I feel different somehow.
Like a real woman.

03:01.949 --> 03:05.725
I wanna do more, see more.
I wanna be more.

03:05.829 --> 03:07.860
What would you wanna do?

03:07.961 --> 03:10.261
How about a trip before
we get back to school?

03:10.361 --> 03:12.921
We haven't been
at the river in ages. -Sure.

03:13.022 --> 03:15.346
Maybe dad will let us
have a Landrover.

03:15.447 --> 03:17.687
Maybe Kevin can come with us?

03:17.788 --> 03:21.879
I see. You'd like to have more sex,
is that it? -No... Well, yeah.

03:22.171 --> 03:24.574
Look, we'll get a bunch
of us together and...

03:24.675 --> 03:26.800
if your dad lets us
have a Landrover,

03:26.901 --> 03:29.562
we should go further up the river
than we've ever been before.

03:29.663 --> 03:32.875
Even up to Taylor's Stitch.
And all the way into Hell.

03:33.449 --> 03:36.778
Hell is on the other side of
Taylor's Stitch. Nobody goes there.

03:36.879 --> 03:39.489
Yes. Why don't you go up the
river again? You always loved that.

03:39.590 --> 03:41.811
Because we wanna go somewhere
we haven't gone before.

03:41.912 --> 03:44.559
Make it a real adventure.
- Why Landrover? Why not the bikes?

03:44.660 --> 03:48.665
Or horses even. Like in an old
fashioned camp out. That'd be fun.

03:49.301 --> 03:51.317
Guys, I'm not ten anymore.

03:51.419 --> 03:55.179
Besides, if there was an emergency,
wouldn't you prefer that I had Landrover?

03:55.297 --> 03:58.418
I don't know, Ellie.
It's a pretty big ask.

03:58.619 --> 04:01.266
Like it or not, dad,
I'm turning 18 this year.

04:01.367 --> 04:05.131
Don't you think it's time
I started showing initiative and...

04:05.441 --> 04:08.818
independence and all those
other good things?

04:13.186 --> 04:15.671
C'mon. It's just a couple of days.

04:15.771 --> 04:18.572
What's the worst
that could possibly happen?

04:20.658 --> 04:23.205
But the show is on this weekend.
- So what?

04:23.305 --> 04:26.736
Do you really care if your mom
wins best decorated cake?

04:27.371 --> 04:29.280
Flip!

04:29.467 --> 04:32.537
<i>I always pictured Kevin in 20 years
being president of the Show Society,</i>

04:32.638 --> 04:35.486
<i>and bringing up his 3 kids.
- Alright.</i>

04:35.587 --> 04:38.242
<i>With Corrie, if she got her way.
- Anything for you.</i>

04:38.343 --> 04:40.628
<i>And she usually did.</i>

04:40.894 --> 04:43.426
Please, tell him he can go to
the bloody show if he wants to.

04:43.527 --> 04:45.726
There's plenty of guys
who'd kill to come with us.

04:45.827 --> 04:49.848
Come on, who else can we ask?
- Somebody fun.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.838
Homer.

04:55.272 --> 04:57.573
I'll see you next weekend, sunshine.

04:57.673 --> 05:01.748
<i>Homer grew up on the farm next to mine.
He was kind of like a brother to me.</i>

05:02.348 --> 05:06.028
<i>He was always getting into trouble.
Both in school and out.</i>

05:06.230 --> 05:09.606
<i>The new police sergeant
arrested him 3 times in one week.</i>

05:09.808 --> 05:13.203
Hey, sarge, how're you going?
Good?

05:13.964 --> 05:16.219
<i>That didn't slow down Homer.</i>

05:16.320 --> 05:19.646
- Alright. -Yeah?
How's the wife, is she good?

05:19.930 --> 05:22.596
<i>I think it was the proud
rebellious greek side of him.</i>

05:22.697 --> 05:26.514
<i>He just didn't care what he did.
Or what anyone thought of him.</i>

05:39.665 --> 05:42.160
How about it?
Are you in or are you out?

05:42.261 --> 05:45.662
Yeah, I'll have a go at that.
Just you girls going?

05:45.763 --> 05:49.371
- Yeah, and Kevin. -It'll be good
for you to have a man around.

05:49.473 --> 05:52.072
To do all the hard work for you.

06:07.352 --> 06:10.555
Well, that's four. Anyone else?

06:11.061 --> 06:13.884
What about Fiona Maxwell?

06:13.984 --> 06:16.785
Fifi, out in the bush? Seriously?

06:16.939 --> 06:19.535
Oh gosh! You really want me?

06:19.636 --> 06:23.146
<i>Fi was the only person I knew
under 60 who said 'gosh'.</i>

06:23.446 --> 06:26.915
Well, no. But our parents said
we had to bring someone along

06:27.015 --> 06:30.642
with a little bit of class.
To balance out all us inbred rurals.

06:30.843 --> 06:33.344
<i>She lived in town,
but we liked her anyway.</i>

06:33.443 --> 06:36.445
Okay. Give me a sec
and I'll ask mom.

06:36.975 --> 06:40.337
Mommy, can I please go camping
with the girls this weekend?

06:40.438 --> 06:43.786
Camping, out in the bush? Seriously?

06:44.421 --> 06:47.246
<i>I'll admit it, Lee was an odd choice.</i>

06:47.347 --> 06:51.164
<i>He was always working in his mom
and dad's restaurant, or of course...</i>

06:51.320 --> 06:53.546
<i>... playing piano.</i>

06:55.105 --> 06:59.908
<i>Everyone else thought he was strange.
I just thought he was interesting.</i>

07:01.013 --> 07:05.286
May I take your order?
- No, sorry, I don't wanna order anything.

07:05.587 --> 07:08.375
Is this for pick-up or for take-away?

07:08.476 --> 07:11.903
No, I would like to speak to
your son Lee. Is he available?

07:12.004 --> 07:15.983
You have menu? -No. Yes I do,
but I don't wanna order anything.

07:16.084 --> 07:19.372
What you want?
- I want Lee.

07:20.348 --> 07:23.040
Your son Lee.
I want Lee.

07:23.509 --> 07:27.077
I want Lee.
- This is Lee.

07:30.508 --> 07:33.824
Good evening.
This is Ellie Linton.

07:33.925 --> 07:38.475
I sat next to you in geography
last year. It was on tuesdays.

07:38.655 --> 07:43.888
I have... sort of longish dark hair.
- Yeah, I know who you are, Ellie.

07:44.421 --> 07:49.066
Good. Well, some
friends of mine and I are...

07:49.807 --> 07:53.754
We're skipping the show this weekend
and we're going camping instead.

07:53.954 --> 07:57.427
I was... We were wondering if...

07:57.728 --> 08:00.768
maybe... if you wanted to...

08:01.169 --> 08:04.169
... come with us? Or not?

08:04.383 --> 08:07.727
No, that would be awesome.
- Really?

08:08.028 --> 08:11.810
Oh, good. I'll put you down then.

08:15.380 --> 08:19.493
It was actually... -My mom
makes me go help out now.

08:19.595 --> 08:22.622
Can you text me the details?

08:22.949 --> 08:26.215
Yes, I can...
Yes. I'll do that.

08:26.416 --> 08:28.968
Alright. See you.
- B... bye.

08:30.873 --> 08:34.393
<i>Lee made it six. But dad said
we had to have eight.</i>

08:34.495 --> 08:38.335
<i>Eventually we compromised on 7,
as long as Robyn was the 7th.</i>

08:38.535 --> 08:41.970
Sorry, Robyn.
If it was just you girls...

08:42.322 --> 08:46.111
... but with boys?
Not without an adult present.

08:46.312 --> 08:49.845
<i>Of course, if parents ever had a daughter
they could trust, it was Robyn.</i>

08:49.946 --> 08:52.940
Well, the boys will be
in separate tents, dad.

08:53.588 --> 08:57.449
And besides,
this camping trip isn't about...

08:58.399 --> 09:02.674
... romance or anything. It's more
about getting back to nature.

09:02.872 --> 09:05.513
You know, we're all kind of...

09:05.614 --> 09:09.814
cooped up in this modern environment,
and I think this camping trip

09:09.914 --> 09:13.624
will help me to help my friends
become closer to God.

09:13.724 --> 09:17.567
Because we need to share
a spiritual connection.

09:18.105 --> 09:23.084
If parents were present, I don't think
that I'd be able to reach these girls.

09:23.185 --> 09:26.570
And these boys
as much as I would like to.

10:01.356 --> 10:05.594
Are you alright, Fi?
You're looking a bit pale.

10:10.018 --> 10:12.883
You look like you're gonna...

10:15.473 --> 10:18.673
It's stuck in the back
of your throat, isn't it?

10:19.089 --> 10:22.349
You're trying
to swallow it all down.

10:22.595 --> 10:25.729
But it just keeps coming back up.

10:35.565 --> 10:37.654
Okay, I got it.

10:37.894 --> 10:41.509
How much stuff do you need?
- Oh my God Ellie, look at this!

10:41.610 --> 10:44.600
Wait, what is this? Makeup?

10:44.767 --> 10:47.554
You never know
who you're going to meet.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.645
Hey, you can see
Cobbler's Bay from here.

10:50.762 --> 10:53.843
You can even see the Heron Bridge.

10:54.586 --> 10:58.635
How far do you reckon we've come?
- That was the easy part.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.665
From here on, we walk.

11:25.259 --> 11:28.772
Ready? On the count of three. One...

11:30.683 --> 11:33.744
Give me a decent throw, sweetheart.

11:58.912 --> 12:01.053
Let's go.

12:02.751 --> 12:05.375
I meant to do that.

12:08.563 --> 12:11.967
Homer, do you even know
where we're going?

12:12.425 --> 12:15.261
There's a clearing up ahead.

12:33.665 --> 12:36.559
This is very pretty for Hell.

12:37.319 --> 12:40.749
I wonder how long it's been
since anyone's been down here.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.862
I wonder if anyone has
ever been down here, I mean...

12:43.989 --> 12:48.443
why would anyone else've bothered?
- Maybe we're the first ones to see it.

12:50.468 --> 12:54.022
There's no reception. -What were
you expecting, broadband?

12:54.123 --> 12:56.423
Couldn't hurt.

12:56.620 --> 13:00.065
You, what's your name.
Go get some firewood, will you?

13:00.166 --> 13:02.566
It's Lee.

13:04.312 --> 13:07.839
Ellie, what are we having for dinner?

13:08.140 --> 13:11.413
Two-minute noodles.
- Oh, great!

13:12.338 --> 13:14.895
What are they?

13:16.110 --> 13:19.198
You've never heard
of two-minute noodles?

13:19.400 --> 13:22.799
No, my mom is really
into health foods.

13:24.905 --> 13:29.594
It's an awesome feeling to realise you're
about to change someone's life forever.

13:38.866 --> 13:41.853
You haven't got 2000 dollars.

14:15.779 --> 14:19.382
Wait a sec, not one guy
asked you out last year?

14:19.483 --> 14:22.083
No. Why would they?

14:22.200 --> 14:25.124
Why? You're beautiful, Fi.

14:25.415 --> 14:28.878
My mom is beautiful.
I'm just...

14:29.471 --> 14:33.849
You remember, I had braces
for like two years.

14:34.631 --> 14:38.261
I still wear glasses and it's not...

14:40.207 --> 14:43.457
She was Miss Wirrawee
three years in a row.

14:43.558 --> 14:47.329
I actually asked her
if I should enter this year,

14:47.517 --> 14:50.463
but she didn't think
that was a good idea.

14:50.564 --> 14:54.064
Anyway, I'm doing really well
at school at the moment, so...

14:54.271 --> 14:56.913
... doesn't matter.

14:57.339 --> 15:02.522
And, you know,
a guy will ask me out one day.

15:03.986 --> 15:07.269
I just don't know when. Or who.

15:07.494 --> 15:10.309
Which is exciting.

15:12.971 --> 15:16.832
Boys are idiots.
- Fun idiots.

15:24.450 --> 15:27.066
You shall not pass.

16:03.476 --> 16:06.165
What's that smell?

16:06.367 --> 16:09.232
- Jet fuel.
- What?

16:11.390 --> 16:14.854
Just a bunch of army planes
going somewhere.

16:25.161 --> 16:27.944
El, what do you think of Fi?

16:28.141 --> 16:32.100
I love Fi, you know that.
She seems so perfect.

16:32.300 --> 16:35.322
I guess she thinks
I'm a total loser, huh?

16:35.426 --> 16:40.298
I don't think she hates you.
- Yeah, but... you know.

16:41.229 --> 16:45.584
She lives in that big house.
Talks like Mrs Hamilton.

16:46.742 --> 16:51.193
Me and my family... we are just
greek peasants to people like her.

16:52.513 --> 16:55.560
Why don't you ask her out?

16:56.700 --> 16:59.325
I don't know.

17:00.491 --> 17:04.375
Girl as pretty as that
must get asked out all the time.

17:07.229 --> 17:10.020
Did anyone else hear
those planes last night?

17:10.121 --> 17:13.721
Yeah. There was six lots of them.
They were flying really low.

17:13.821 --> 17:17.138
No, there were dozens and dozens.
We were counting them, Lee and me.

17:17.289 --> 17:20.913
Lee and I. -But seriously, what do
you think those planes were doing?

17:21.020 --> 17:23.128
Maybe they weren't even ours.

17:23.230 --> 17:26.230
It's probably the start of World
War Three and we don't even know.

17:26.330 --> 17:29.118
Alright, who's having rabbit?

17:29.520 --> 17:33.810
Is there any chocolate left?
- Sadly, we're all out.

17:34.248 --> 17:38.424
Oh look, I found some.
- Don't be a dickhead. Give it back!

17:38.691 --> 17:42.509
Thank you. Kevin?
- I was gonna give you some.

18:29.846 --> 18:32.654
So beautiful out here.

18:33.512 --> 18:36.497
I wonder why they call it Hell.

18:39.168 --> 18:44.525
I guess cause it's so wild
and untamed and stuff. Right?

18:49.126 --> 18:51.126
Right.

18:53.854 --> 18:57.782
Wild is difficult.
And it's wonderful and fascinating.

18:57.883 --> 19:03.316
But it's not Hell. People call it that.
People stick labels on things.

19:03.503 --> 19:07.944
Until nobody can see them for who
or what they really are anymore.

19:10.159 --> 19:13.814
Hey, what's going on? -There's
a bloody snake in my sleeping bag.

19:13.915 --> 19:16.916
Are you sure, mate?
I can't see anything.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.802
What kind of snake was it?
- I didn't look.

19:21.903 --> 19:25.512
Lot of redbellies out here.
- Are they deadly?

19:25.648 --> 19:29.179
No. Well... if they bite you.

19:33.286 --> 19:35.460
Shake it.

19:36.119 --> 19:38.847
The bag, Beyonce.

19:39.150 --> 19:41.803
Don't lift it too high.

19:44.585 --> 19:46.629
I got it, I got it!

19:58.021 --> 20:01.180
I was just about
to do that myself.

20:01.281 --> 20:03.805
Christ, that's a big one!

20:03.905 --> 20:06.516
Are you alright?
- Yeah.

20:08.693 --> 20:10.682
Thanks.

20:11.677 --> 20:15.645
I'm not sleeping in that bag
again. Jesus Christ!

20:15.847 --> 20:19.452
- No need to swear.
- Kevin, no need to bloody swear.

20:20.247 --> 20:23.461
Is it dead?
- Looks dead. Wait...

20:25.405 --> 20:28.220
Nobody's laughing, Homer.

20:28.422 --> 20:32.844
Hey, Fi. Why did you go
into the river?

20:33.465 --> 20:35.940
To get away from
the snake, of course.

20:36.041 --> 20:39.841
You do know that snakes
can swim, right? -No, they can't.

20:39.943 --> 20:42.799
- Yeah they can.
- Snakes can't swim.

20:42.899 --> 20:46.784
They don't have fins. They slither.
- They slither through water.

20:46.984 --> 20:50.596
- No, they don't.
- What about sea snakes?

20:53.708 --> 20:56.032
Oh my God!

20:56.390 --> 20:59.282
I could've died!

20:59.583 --> 21:01.583
Oh, Fifi!

21:01.958 --> 21:04.961
Can I go home now?

21:07.564 --> 21:10.219
Do we have to go back?

21:10.320 --> 21:14.335
Well, I'm excited about
a hot shower. And a pillow.

21:14.435 --> 21:18.035
A pillow would be nice.
Let's do this again.

21:18.139 --> 21:21.159
Back here in the same place.
- With the same people.

21:21.260 --> 21:23.960
- If we can find it again.
- We'll find it again.

21:24.061 --> 21:26.995
Let's keep it quiet or
everyone will start coming here

21:27.096 --> 21:30.096
and the place will be
wrecked in no time.

21:31.118 --> 21:34.513
Ladies and gentlemen...
and Homer.

21:34.855 --> 21:37.790
To Hell!
- To Hell.

21:44.376 --> 21:46.816
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

22:05.628 --> 22:08.831
Ellie, what's with your dog?
- Millie!

22:21.956 --> 22:24.562
Mom! Mom?

22:25.313 --> 22:28.309
Dad! Hallo!

22:31.120 --> 22:33.469
Where are you parents?
- I don't know.

22:33.570 --> 22:36.382
- Maybe they left a note.
- Did they say they were going away?

22:36.483 --> 22:39.192
- What's the story, El?
- I've no idea. They should be here.

22:39.294 --> 22:42.483
- Let's ring my parents.
- No, ring Homer's. They're closer.

22:44.061 --> 22:47.063
There's no dial tone.
- What?

22:54.110 --> 22:56.315
What about TV?

22:56.419 --> 23:00.211
Maybe your grandmother got sick so
they left... -And cut the phone lines?

23:00.311 --> 23:03.876
- Some big electrical problem?
- No, they wouldn't leave Millie to...

23:04.866 --> 23:08.476
Oh, stinks! -Power must be out.
I'll check the generator.

23:09.113 --> 23:11.859
Where's your laptop?

23:28.431 --> 23:31.902
- Shit!
- Ellie, let's go to Homer's.

23:34.309 --> 23:36.422
- Ellie...
- What?

23:36.522 --> 23:40.564
- Maybe not a good idea.
- Stop the car. Let me out!

23:42.965 --> 23:45.365
Mama! Papa!

23:48.994 --> 23:52.145
Wait, where's Lee going? Lee?

23:54.312 --> 23:57.123
What are you doing?

24:00.431 --> 24:03.988
We shouldn't leave it in the open.
- Remember the planes?

24:04.092 --> 24:07.166
We weren't in the open.
Are you serious?

24:14.147 --> 24:16.155
Homer?

24:18.528 --> 24:21.093
I already tried that.

24:22.348 --> 24:25.348
Real quiet out there.
- Did you send out a call?

24:25.581 --> 24:27.933
Wouldn't be safe.

24:28.113 --> 24:30.809
No! I know what you're thinking
and it's not possible.

24:30.910 --> 24:33.004
Absolutely, completely impossible.

24:33.105 --> 24:36.005
That kind of stuff just doesn't
happen here. Not in this country.

24:36.104 --> 24:39.148
We gotta be careful.
It could be a lot at stake here.

24:39.274 --> 24:42.462
She's right. We've got to assume
something bad has happened.

24:42.562 --> 24:45.565
Of course something bad
has happened. My dog is dead.

24:45.666 --> 24:48.906
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Shut up! Everyone shut up!

24:49.007 --> 24:52.094
Jesus Christ, what is going on?

24:54.926 --> 24:58.158
Kevin's place was next.
I don't remember who suggested it,

24:58.261 --> 25:01.704
but we decided to
stay off the main roads.

25:07.098 --> 25:09.732
Mom! Dad! Mitchell!

25:11.915 --> 25:13.866
Flip?

25:15.850 --> 25:17.918
Flip!

25:21.642 --> 25:25.996
Looks alright. -He always has a bucket
of food and some water. Don't you, boy?

25:27.883 --> 25:30.425
You can't bring that.

25:30.552 --> 25:34.618
You think I'm just gonna leave
him here? I'm not leaving him!

25:36.147 --> 25:37.955
Stop it!

25:38.058 --> 25:40.256
I'm not leaving him!

25:41.601 --> 25:44.175
He's got a point.

25:48.135 --> 25:51.764
Let's take Flip to Corrie's and then
we can make another decision

25:51.864 --> 25:55.365
depending on what we
find there. Agreed?

25:57.569 --> 26:00.402
Flip, let's go.

26:08.001 --> 26:10.214
C'mon.

26:16.077 --> 26:19.408
That's four out of four.
The rest of you live in town.

26:19.509 --> 26:22.995
Robyn's house is on Coachman's
Lane. That's probably the closest.

26:23.096 --> 26:26.389
Yeah, you can see most of Wirrawee
from the hill at the back.

26:26.510 --> 26:29.926
It might tell us something.
- Then we go to Robyn's next.

26:51.606 --> 26:54.410
Flip, sit. Stay.

26:57.533 --> 27:01.618
Please don't touch that.
- Let's go up that hill.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.610
Something's going on
at the Showground.

27:13.712 --> 27:16.910
I think that's where everyone is.
- What about those other lights?

27:17.011 --> 27:19.694
Hospital. Must be using
the emergency generators.

27:19.807 --> 27:21.834
Maybe we should split up.

27:21.935 --> 27:24.263
Split up? No, we can't.
We have to stay together.

27:24.365 --> 27:28.054
We need to be out of town
before dawn. Just in case.

27:29.527 --> 27:33.588
I'll take Fi to her house.
Lee, you take Robyn to yours.

27:33.788 --> 27:36.838
We'll meet back here at 5 a.m.

27:37.347 --> 27:39.900
So we just stay here?

27:43.574 --> 27:46.602
You get to go to the Show.

28:02.902 --> 28:06.002
Whose voices are those?
- I don't know.

28:07.683 --> 28:10.726
I think we should go back.
- No. Wait.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.862
We have to get a better
look before we leave.

28:14.962 --> 28:16.962
Better look at what, Ellie?
Let's go!

28:17.062 --> 28:20.888
One of us has to get closer before
we go. We gotta see what's going on.

28:21.285 --> 28:24.087
I'm not leaving Corrie here.

28:27.347 --> 28:30.118
- I'll go.
- Ellie!

28:32.343 --> 28:35.599
If anything happens, run.

29:35.605 --> 29:39.231
<i>Do not try to escape
or you will be shot.</i>

30:04.268 --> 30:06.199
Dad!

30:06.735 --> 30:10.655
This is bloody ridiculous. I've been
waiting in this stupid line for 2 hours!

30:10.757 --> 30:13.702
Who do you people think you are?

30:15.464 --> 30:17.510
Hands off me.

31:11.116 --> 31:13.537
Are you okay?

31:14.260 --> 31:16.698
Where's Kevin?

31:19.533 --> 31:22.380
Quick! They're coming!

31:24.100 --> 31:26.526
Ellie... -What?
- Can we stop?

31:26.626 --> 31:29.658
Corrie, c'mon! Please! Please.

31:30.948 --> 31:32.922
Come on.

31:33.781 --> 31:36.874
Where are they now?
- I don't know. -Guys!

31:36.975 --> 31:39.776
Kevin! Oh my God!
What happened to you?

31:39.928 --> 31:44.147
I thought that you're ahead of me,
so I just... I just ran.

31:45.478 --> 31:48.725
Ellie said that if anything
was to happen to run.

31:52.326 --> 31:54.726
- Oh my God!
- Go!

32:03.443 --> 32:05.637
C'mon, c'mon...

32:06.374 --> 32:08.717
Let's go.

32:09.964 --> 32:13.018
- I hurt my knee.
- C'mon, we gotta keep moving.

32:15.963 --> 32:18.977
Are you alright?
- No. I cut it. Jesus!

32:25.696 --> 32:28.095
Give me your shirt. Quick.

32:28.196 --> 32:32.601
Singlet, it's better. Quick.
Get me a stick or something.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.986
Stay here.

32:44.775 --> 32:47.164
Ellie, hurry up!

32:50.802 --> 32:53.086
Quick, get back!

32:56.187 --> 32:59.141
- Will this do?
- Yeah, quick.

33:00.368 --> 33:03.340
Ellie, they are coming.
- Alright.

33:06.101 --> 33:08.122
Light it.

33:10.891 --> 33:12.945
Light it.

33:30.254 --> 33:34.821
Corrie, we gotta get out of here.
Get up, c'mon. Ellie, let's go!

33:40.718 --> 33:42.827
Hang up.

33:47.038 --> 33:49.942
<i>She wasn't much older than I was.</i>

33:50.244 --> 33:53.232
<i>And she looked just as scared.</i>

34:04.326 --> 34:06.808
<i>I'll never forget her.</i>

34:06.908 --> 34:09.920
Ellie, we don't have time.
- Come on!

34:13.675 --> 34:16.678
Thank God!
We heard an explosion.

34:16.780 --> 34:20.036
- Yeah, that was us.
- Are you alright? -Yeah.

34:21.077 --> 34:24.120
Flip! There he is. Good boy!

34:24.620 --> 34:27.821
Where did all those
soldiers come from?

34:31.549 --> 34:34.474
Where did you get this thing?

34:38.542 --> 34:41.431
Wait, where's Robyn and Lee?

34:43.235 --> 34:46.181
They haven't come back yet.
- It's almost 6 a.m.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.984
We were just about
to give up on all of you.

34:49.085 --> 34:52.047
We have to go and find them
then, don't we? -Ellie...

34:52.168 --> 34:55.210
Homer, we have to go find them.
- It's daylight now.

34:55.330 --> 34:58.029
- I'm not leaving them.
- We're not leaving them.

34:58.136 --> 35:00.417
We'll come back tonight
when it's safer.

35:00.517 --> 35:03.635
Yeah cause there'll be soldiers
crawling all over town by now.

35:03.736 --> 35:06.597
I mean... after what you did.

35:08.192 --> 35:12.174
We will find them.
Ellie, I promise.

35:33.013 --> 35:36.984
El... El... come on.

35:45.028 --> 35:47.789
- Wait, just...
- No, don't touch me.

35:57.114 --> 36:00.281
Sit down over there.
- Are you alright?

36:00.537 --> 36:03.590
I'll get us some food.
- Thank you.

36:06.511 --> 36:09.760
So, any idea whose army it is?
- We didn't exactly stop to ask.

36:09.861 --> 36:12.875
We'll ask Robyn. She's good
with flags and things like that.

36:12.976 --> 36:15.741
All I can say is they are not greek.
- It doesn't matter who they are,

36:15.842 --> 36:18.019
because they're here.
We just got to deal with it.

36:18.121 --> 36:19.663
Alright, mate. Calm down.

36:19.764 --> 36:23.164
No, seriously, what difference
does a flag make?

36:51.441 --> 36:54.308
Fi made this for you.

36:59.633 --> 37:02.512
Her house is empty too?
- Yeah.

37:03.356 --> 37:05.777
There are soldiers everywhere.

37:05.983 --> 37:08.778
We crawled all the way
back to Robyn's.

37:09.305 --> 37:12.156
Not bad for a first date.

37:22.480 --> 37:25.491
The others told me what happened.

37:26.802 --> 37:28.602
El.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.998
It's not your fault.

37:32.291 --> 37:35.870
It's not your fault.
It's theirs.

37:37.148 --> 37:40.217
It's all theirs.

37:41.939 --> 37:44.752
You're changing.
- Yeah?

37:46.503 --> 37:51.051
- For better or worse?
- Better. Definitely better.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.742
Looks good.

38:33.189 --> 38:36.247
Fi'd always say
she'd be a doctor.

38:45.656 --> 38:49.280
You're gonna have to forgive him
sooner or later, you know.

38:49.771 --> 38:52.593
He just left us, Ellie.

38:53.637 --> 38:56.508
He just ran and left us.

38:57.953 --> 39:00.841
I thought he loved me.

39:02.024 --> 39:05.676
Do you remember how many
hours we used to spend up here?

39:05.941 --> 39:08.797
You mean the tea parties?

39:09.898 --> 39:13.494
We were so innocent
back then. And now I...

39:14.318 --> 39:17.777
I feel like we were innocent
right up until yesterday.

39:18.259 --> 39:21.552
We didn't believe in Santa Claus
or anything like that.

39:21.661 --> 39:24.832
You know, we believed
in other fantasies.

39:25.468 --> 39:28.450
We believed we were safe.

39:30.944 --> 39:34.767
I guess that was the biggest
fantasy of them all, right?

39:36.351 --> 39:40.061
Do you ever think we'll see
Robyn and Lee again?

39:49.433 --> 39:52.244
That's one of ours!

40:14.370 --> 40:17.211
How many planes do we have?

40:17.478 --> 40:20.011
One less now.

40:20.875 --> 40:22.756
How's this?

40:22.857 --> 40:25.779
I'm going to Wirrawee with Ellie
and we look for Robyn and Lee.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.722
You three go back to my place
and load up the Landrover.

40:28.823 --> 40:31.178
Seems a hell of a risk
going back into Wirrawee.

40:31.279 --> 40:34.327
What if it was you
they're going back for?

40:34.709 --> 40:37.086
Don't ask me to go with you.
- He's not.

40:37.187 --> 40:39.287
Good, because
I'm not bloody going.

40:39.387 --> 40:42.143
Jesus, Kevin. Everything is
a risk from now on.

40:42.244 --> 40:47.100
We can't sit around here forever.
The biggest risk is to take no risk.

40:48.007 --> 40:52.646
Alright. But if we can't stay here
where do you want us all to go?

40:54.809 --> 40:56.737
Hell.

40:57.038 --> 41:00.234
We're not taking your teddies.
- Not all of them, just one.

41:00.335 --> 41:03.220
We can't take things like that.
- Why can't we?

41:03.321 --> 41:06.763
This isn't a picnic, El. We have
to start acting like soldiers.

41:07.165 --> 41:10.638
One mistake and... it's all over.

41:12.928 --> 41:16.685
Can we take my mom's crowns and sashes?
- Yeah, and photos. Don't forget photos.

41:16.786 --> 41:19.300
Geez, we're gonna need
a trailer pretty soon.

41:19.401 --> 41:22.801
Look, if you can take teddies,
crowns and photos,

41:22.924 --> 41:26.680
I might aswell take my dad's
bloody football trophies.

41:32.115 --> 41:35.389
Oh, and dog food for Flip.
Lots of dog food. Write that down.

41:35.489 --> 41:38.141
- He can eat rabbit.
- What about wire cutters?

41:38.242 --> 41:40.914
Now that's a great idea.

41:42.747 --> 41:45.085
Two T's.

41:58.061 --> 42:00.601
What about guns?
- We'll take our own guns.

42:00.702 --> 42:03.469
Just turn it off.
- No, I can fix this. Hang on.

42:06.721 --> 42:09.249
The pipe's burst again.

42:13.538 --> 42:16.171
So, we've got plenty of
ammo for the rifles,

42:16.273 --> 42:18.673
and a full magazine for that.

42:18.916 --> 42:21.158
I got it!

42:25.429 --> 42:27.758
What's that?

42:31.217 --> 42:33.966
We forgot to have someone on watch.

42:34.261 --> 42:37.038
Don't touch the curtains.

42:38.528 --> 42:41.215
Spread out!
Go into different rooms.

42:41.316 --> 42:44.904
If you see anything, yell out.
But stay hidden.

42:48.958 --> 42:50.597
Flip!

42:50.891 --> 42:53.333
Flip, get inside!

43:02.668 --> 43:05.268
It's here!

43:05.869 --> 43:08.888
Did they see you?
- I don't know.

43:39.254 --> 43:41.293
Homer!

43:46.180 --> 43:48.202
Ellie!

43:48.605 --> 43:50.974
Stay still!

44:19.135 --> 44:22.017
Good thing you're so skinny.

44:22.713 --> 44:25.684
Hey guys, I think it's coming back.

44:43.313 --> 44:46.435
Flairs. They're marking the house.

44:48.937 --> 44:51.937
- Thanks a lot, Homer.
- No one asked your opinion, mate.

44:52.038 --> 44:55.038
They know we're here now. -Of course they
know. They saw us through the window.

44:55.140 --> 44:58.140
But they didn't know we had guns!

45:01.338 --> 45:04.938
Let's get out of here.
C'mon, let's get out of here, now!

45:05.140 --> 45:07.140
Go, go, go...

45:08.140 --> 45:10.740
Go, go, move it!

45:12.941 --> 45:14.741
Run!

45:15.341 --> 45:17.141
Run!
- Flip!

45:17.242 --> 45:19.642
Leave him!
- No!

46:07.946 --> 46:10.310
<i>Homer was right.</i>

46:11.890 --> 46:14.565
<i>Hell was the only
safe place for us now.</i>

46:14.666 --> 46:17.489
<i>But first we had to find
Robyn and Lee.</i>

46:19.483 --> 46:22.616
What's wrong?
- The Heron Bridge!

46:32.508 --> 46:35.392
Jesus, look at them all.

46:35.635 --> 46:38.685
They are coming up from
Cobbler's Bay.

46:39.313 --> 46:42.210
I bet you this is one of
the first places they captured.

46:42.312 --> 46:44.912
It's probably
full of ships right now.

46:45.013 --> 46:48.197
Yeah. And our bridge
gives them direct access to it.

46:49.230 --> 46:52.098
I've always hated that bridge.

46:52.482 --> 46:56.236
Come on, we have to
get to Robyn's house.

47:20.211 --> 47:22.058
Robyn!

47:22.791 --> 47:24.670
Ellie?

47:32.532 --> 47:36.184
How did you know it was her?
- That's her dad's walking stick.

47:36.539 --> 47:39.746
What was she gonna do,
beat us with it?

47:44.223 --> 47:46.428
Ellie, thank God!

47:46.529 --> 47:49.529
- Are you hurt?
- No, no, I'm fine.

47:49.734 --> 47:52.219
Where is Lee?

47:53.407 --> 47:55.972
He's been shot.

48:11.624 --> 48:14.182
Wait here a minute.

48:15.198 --> 48:18.039
Someone should go with her.

48:30.998 --> 48:33.746
All clear. Let's go.

48:37.246 --> 48:40.436
Robyn. Go, go, go...

49:17.525 --> 49:20.341
Don't point that thing at me.
- This is dr Clement.

49:20.442 --> 49:23.040
It's okay, he's my dentist.
He works across the street.

49:23.141 --> 49:26.187
- Dr Clement, it's me. It's Robyn.
- Quiet down, the lot of you.

49:26.288 --> 49:28.688
Don't you know there's
a bloody war going on?

49:28.791 --> 49:31.256
Shine that here.

49:33.325 --> 49:37.413
How is it? -He was lucky.
The bullet went right through.

49:37.853 --> 49:41.291
Thank you. -You picked the hell
of a weekend to go camping.

49:41.424 --> 49:44.023
We heard the planes,
but we didn't see any...

49:44.168 --> 49:47.808
That's how they did it.
Freighter planes and container ships.

49:47.911 --> 49:51.567
Took all the ports and runways
in the first 24 hours.

49:51.776 --> 49:54.958
News said there was some
kind of explosion at the airfield.

49:55.059 --> 49:57.910
None of us paid much attention to it.
Next thing you know,

49:58.012 --> 50:00.915
they are rolling across the bridge
in their tanks and trucks,

50:01.015 --> 50:03.889
rounding up everyone, taking
them all to the Showground.

50:03.989 --> 50:07.321
Lee's whole family.
Yours too.

50:07.692 --> 50:10.905
And mine? -Yours I don't
know anything about.

50:11.385 --> 50:14.078
What about my parents?
George and Martha Yannos.

50:14.180 --> 50:16.181
Did they ever get
their teeth fixed? -No.

50:16.282 --> 50:18.932
Then how the hell would I know who
they are? -I was just asking, doc.

50:19.035 --> 50:21.269
I've been hiding in the closet
for three straight days,

50:21.370 --> 50:24.870
living in my own piss and shit, just
waiting for them to come and find me.

50:25.017 --> 50:28.309
I thought I'll finally snap when
I saw you carrying Lee in here.

50:28.412 --> 50:31.458
- You carried him?
- Yeah, I had to.

50:31.768 --> 50:34.616
If his leg starts to hurt,
you gotta give him another shot.

50:34.717 --> 50:37.301
Wait, you're not staying with us?

50:37.412 --> 50:40.553
Look, I took a hell of a risk
coming down here for Lee, alright?

50:40.655 --> 50:43.686
I've done enough.
I've gotta go.

50:45.608 --> 50:49.692
Wait, dr Clement. Are there
any others out there? Like us?

50:50.361 --> 50:53.749
Oh, yeah. I've seen few people
try to do some things.

50:53.869 --> 50:56.260
Try to be heroes.

50:56.361 --> 50:59.062
Apparently one group even
tried to blow up Heron bridge.

50:59.161 --> 51:02.798
To stop all those bloody convoys
coming up from Cobbler's Bay.

51:02.900 --> 51:05.839
They all paid the price.

51:59.393 --> 52:01.712
Are you okay?

52:04.092 --> 52:07.082
I think we should get a vehicle.
- We always had two.

52:07.183 --> 52:10.379
First one you dump somewhere.
Second one is a getaway car.

52:10.479 --> 52:14.766
- So, you had practice at this?
- Great. I'll just go get mom's car,

52:14.867 --> 52:18.947
park it at the front and ask soldiers
to look the other way, shall I?

52:24.316 --> 52:27.227
Sorry. I'm just... tired.

52:27.469 --> 52:30.420
How about if we get
something silent?

52:30.521 --> 52:33.521
Golf carts, shopping trollies...
- Prams, pushers...

52:33.766 --> 52:36.779
Wheelchairs? -Yeah, could you
ride in a wheelchair?

52:36.880 --> 52:40.951
I could, but the more I move
the more it hurts. -Wait...

52:42.395 --> 52:44.937
What if we're going about this
the wrong way?

52:45.037 --> 52:47.038
What do you mean?

52:47.241 --> 52:50.656
We're thinking of quiet
sneaky little things, right?

52:53.828 --> 52:56.408
What if we went
to the other extreme?

52:56.508 --> 53:00.720
Rock up in something so indestructible
that it wouldn't matter who saw us.

53:02.184 --> 53:04.556
Such as?

53:27.400 --> 53:29.223
Shit!

53:29.824 --> 53:31.825
Let's go!

53:32.483 --> 53:34.987
Are you alright?
- Hang on. -What?

53:35.088 --> 53:37.929
- I can't climb up there.
- Get in the bucket.

53:38.143 --> 53:40.549
- In this?
- Yeah.

53:45.523 --> 53:47.734
I thought you said
you could drive this thing.

53:47.835 --> 53:50.835
I said I can drive a tractor.
Get in.

53:55.240 --> 53:57.050
Oh shit.

53:58.948 --> 54:01.633
Drive, Ellie. Drive!

54:09.064 --> 54:12.228
Take this, shoot back at them!
- No, I won't do it.

54:12.329 --> 54:15.567
This is no time to get religious.
- I said no!

54:21.309 --> 54:23.976
You're bleeding!

54:31.777 --> 54:33.577
Go!

54:42.981 --> 54:46.507
I hope Homer's got a getaway car.
- I hope he remembers where to meet us.

54:46.607 --> 54:50.207
Even Homer knows how to
find a bloody church. -Ellie!

54:55.407 --> 54:57.979
Start praying again.

55:20.335 --> 55:23.735
Lord, forgive us our sins...

55:30.336 --> 55:32.359
Hold on!

55:48.592 --> 55:51.422
I think we lost one of them.

55:57.056 --> 55:59.456
We lost a tire!

56:09.831 --> 56:13.620
You're driving in circles!
- I'm doing the best I can!

56:32.269 --> 56:36.344
You are dangerous. -That's what
my driving instructor said.

56:43.280 --> 56:45.954
He's still chasing us!

56:56.406 --> 57:00.126
How do you dump the rubbish?
- That switch, I think.

57:23.451 --> 57:27.022
Who is dangerous now?
- Do you think any of them got hurt?

57:27.167 --> 57:30.424
Don't worry.
God will understand.

57:49.679 --> 57:51.941
Where's Homer?

57:52.109 --> 57:54.985
He's supposed to be here.
Where is he?

57:55.178 --> 57:57.894
Maybe he got caught.

57:59.213 --> 58:01.235
We have to keep going,
get out of town.

58:01.336 --> 58:03.237
No. Ellie, we've got
to wait for Homer.

58:03.337 --> 58:05.938
How long do you think it's gonna be
before they send another vehicle?

58:06.039 --> 58:09.039
Or even a helicopter?
We have to leave now!

58:12.033 --> 58:15.784
Sorry I'm late. I forgot
where the bloody church was.

59:54.045 --> 59:56.985
Why are we stopping?
- I have to rest.

59:57.186 --> 01:00:00.052
Move over, I'll drive.
- No, dad said only I...

01:00:00.252 --> 01:00:02.652
Just don't, okay?

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:06.598
This is Chris Lang's house.

01:00:06.699 --> 01:00:09.699
Oh, that guy is such a weirdo.
- He's a genius, Kevin.

01:00:09.799 --> 01:00:12.553
- He's a bloody stoner.
- Stoners are people too.

01:00:12.654 --> 01:00:15.997
I don't really care as long as
there's a soft bed in there.

01:00:16.148 --> 01:00:19.683
And maybe a toothbrush.
- I've got a spare toothbrush.

01:00:22.509 --> 01:00:25.647
<i>Chris says his father was born on
the corner of Straight and Narrow.</i>

01:00:25.749 --> 01:00:28.509
<i>And that he was born
in the other end of town.</i>

01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:32.479
The day before it all began,
mom and dad left for Saudi Arabia.

01:00:32.774 --> 01:00:35.653
So, here I am. Alone.

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:38.935
And the power
goes off at like nine...

01:00:39.237 --> 01:00:41.936
... or ten. Nine.

01:00:42.437 --> 01:00:45.637
Yeah, nine.
So I think, okay.

01:00:46.836 --> 01:00:50.081
I better ring up and
find out what's going on.

01:00:51.451 --> 01:00:54.698
I'm an idiot.
The phones are down too.

01:00:54.986 --> 01:01:00.190
So, I'm so bent by this point.
Like, I'm really stoned. I'm baked.

01:01:01.138 --> 01:01:04.185
Anyway, I walk down to the car...

01:01:04.459 --> 01:01:06.859
... and dad, get this right,

01:01:07.059 --> 01:01:11.449
dad has locked the car
and taken the keys with him.

01:01:14.043 --> 01:01:17.129
I think he's such a wanker
for doing that.

01:01:17.332 --> 01:01:21.330
You know, like he didn't even
trust me with a car for one week.

01:01:21.797 --> 01:01:25.450
So now, I have to walk
to the Ramseys' place.

01:01:25.652 --> 01:01:29.308
And it is far. Like,
take what you think is far,

01:01:29.509 --> 01:01:32.909
time it by like 10, say.

01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:38.223
And that's how far it was.
And when I get there...

01:01:38.616 --> 01:01:43.176
... nobody is at home.
And it's like... oh, great!

01:01:44.006 --> 01:01:47.191
Because the next place
is even further.

01:01:47.397 --> 01:01:50.135
Anyway, I walk around the corner.

01:01:50.399 --> 01:01:53.969
And I can see the Ramseys
in their truck.

01:01:56.493 --> 01:01:59.218
They'd hit a tree.

01:01:59.519 --> 01:02:03.020
But that's not
what has killed them.

01:02:04.555 --> 01:02:07.418
They've been shot.

01:02:08.633 --> 01:02:11.163
They've been shot?!

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:15.900
Like no one gets shot.
And I mean, heaps of times.

01:02:19.232 --> 01:02:23.921
Mr Ramsey, Mrs Ramsey,
even baby Jessica's been shot.

01:02:28.617 --> 01:02:31.625
So, I think to myself...

01:02:32.856 --> 01:02:36.309
Either I've been smoking
some really weird shit,

01:02:36.508 --> 01:02:39.930
or this isn't your
typical day in Wirrawee.

01:02:46.427 --> 01:02:50.900
Anyway, I've just been
by myself ever since, really.

01:02:52.238 --> 01:02:56.498
Just chilling out.
It's been nice.

01:03:00.373 --> 01:03:02.499
Nice.

01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:17.073
How funny are dogs?

01:03:22.353 --> 01:03:25.078
How does it feel to get shot?

01:03:25.253 --> 01:03:28.857
I didn't even feel it at first.
But by the time I got back

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.490
to the restaurant, it felt
like my whole leg was on fire.

01:03:32.591 --> 01:03:36.049
Like somebody was pulling
a barbed wire throught it.

01:03:36.325 --> 01:03:39.129
They wrecked your restaurant?

01:03:39.406 --> 01:03:41.209
Yeah.

01:03:41.532 --> 01:03:44.192
I used to hate that place.

01:03:44.508 --> 01:03:48.896
Working there, being there.
Just living there.

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:53.238
I felt like I was
in prison or something.

01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:57.072
But you know, I helped
make that place what it was.

01:03:57.593 --> 01:04:00.474
So when someone smashes a window,

01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:04.374
they are smashing glass that
I hand-polished a thousand times.

01:04:04.634 --> 01:04:08.885
Or they are tearing curtains
that my mom and I hand-stitched.

01:04:10.155 --> 01:04:13.739
You get a certain type
of attachment to the place.

01:04:14.287 --> 01:04:18.873
It's weird. Takes on
its own kind of beauty.

01:04:35.298 --> 01:04:39.310
You know, I always used to
look forward to geography.

01:04:58.711 --> 01:05:02.918
I should go back and
check on Chris. -Chris?

01:05:03.386 --> 01:05:06.134
Yeah, I left him on watch.

01:05:06.267 --> 01:05:08.235
Sorry.

01:05:21.886 --> 01:05:24.028
Chris.

01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:28.229
Chris? Hey!

01:05:40.692 --> 01:05:43.702
Get up. Get up!

01:05:44.113 --> 01:05:47.699
Are you awake now, you little shit?
- Geez Ellie, take it easy.

01:05:48.025 --> 01:05:50.843
- Take it easy? -Yeah, I just
shut my eyes for a second.

01:05:50.945 --> 01:05:53.719
Don't you understand how it's all
changed, Chris? Don't you get it?

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.921
- Yeah, I do. I do get it.
- If we take it easy any more...

01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:59.944
We might aswell shoot each other
now and get it over with.

01:06:00.044 --> 01:06:02.067
Okay I get it. I do.

01:06:02.168 --> 01:06:04.968
I'm sorry.
I'm really really sorry.

01:06:05.488 --> 01:06:08.259
Must be that time of the month.

01:06:10.584 --> 01:06:13.003
Shoot me. -What are you doing?
- Go on Chris, shoot me!

01:06:13.104 --> 01:06:15.504
- I don't wanna shoot you.
- You can't kill me while I'm awake?

01:06:15.607 --> 01:06:18.605
- Geez Ellie, it was an accident.
I'm sorry. -Bullshit you're sorry!

01:06:18.738 --> 01:06:22.555
People are dying out there, Chris.
Families have been split apart.

01:06:22.739 --> 01:06:25.420
We've seen homes
blown to pieces.

01:06:25.631 --> 01:06:28.520
Yet you're up here
having a fuckin vacation.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.536
So, go on. Don't wait
for me to fall asleep.

01:06:31.759 --> 01:06:35.136
Buck up, be a man, look me
in the eye and pull the trigger.

01:06:35.337 --> 01:06:39.106
Ellie, please... -No?
- What are you doing?

01:06:39.465 --> 01:06:42.501
Do you know what penalty is
for falling asleep at your post?

01:06:42.602 --> 01:06:45.804
Do you know what they
used to do? -No, Ellie...

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:48.829
Ellie!

01:06:48.931 --> 01:06:52.581
Put the gun down, please.
I said I'm sorry. Please!

01:06:53.231 --> 01:06:56.031
He risked all our lives.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.193
Ellie.

01:06:59.153 --> 01:07:01.552
It's Chris.

01:07:02.053 --> 01:07:04.754
It's just Chris.

01:08:13.669 --> 01:08:16.636
How long have I been asleep?

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:21.423
About 16 hours.

01:08:36.852 --> 01:08:39.319
How's Chris?

01:08:39.694 --> 01:08:42.578
Still pretty shaken.

01:08:43.425 --> 01:08:46.545
You gave him a hell of a fright,
you know.

01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:54.225
I'll apologize when he wakes up.

01:08:55.366 --> 01:08:57.642
I promise.

01:08:58.586 --> 01:09:02.247
Actually, he wants
to apologize to you.

01:09:03.832 --> 01:09:06.091
You were right, El.

01:09:06.356 --> 01:09:10.109
You went a little overboard
about it, but you were right.

01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:33.868
You're a good mate, Corrie.

01:09:34.602 --> 01:09:37.524
And you're a bloody nutcase.

01:09:49.728 --> 01:09:53.345
- Good book?
- Better than the movie.

01:09:54.903 --> 01:09:59.188
Yeah, books usually are.

01:09:59.298 --> 01:10:03.038
<i>The general repeated his claim
that the Coalition nations</i>

01:10:03.139 --> 01:10:06.043
<i>can no longer support
their booming populations.</i>

01:10:06.144 --> 01:10:09.326
<i>And that Australia must be
made to share her vast land</i>

01:10:09.427 --> 01:10:13.499
<i>and extensive natural resources
with her less fortunate neighbors.</i>

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:17.064
<i>In this way, general hopes
the invasion will balance</i>

01:10:17.165 --> 01:10:19.824
<i>the economic scales
within the region</i>

01:10:19.925 --> 01:10:23.325
<i>and eventually lead to a new era
of peace and stability.</i>

01:10:23.525 --> 01:10:26.758
<i>Meanwhile, more than
half a million Coalition forces</i>

01:10:26.859 --> 01:10:30.259
<i>are pouring into Australia
though three captured ports.</i>

01:10:30.506 --> 01:10:33.706
<i>These ports have now being
identified as Townsville,</i>

01:10:33.808 --> 01:10:36.808
<i>Port Headland and Cobbler's Bay.</i>

01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:41.079
- You heal well.
- I have good genes.

01:10:46.547 --> 01:10:49.470
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:52.372
You know at Chris' house
the other day when I was...

01:10:52.472 --> 01:10:55.335
playing with your hair and then...
- Yeah, all right.

01:10:55.471 --> 01:10:58.544
I know what we did. -Okay,
I thought you might have forgotten.

01:10:58.646 --> 01:11:02.122
What, do you think I do that stuff
so often that I forget about it?

01:11:02.753 --> 01:11:05.409
But you've hardly
spoken to me since then.

01:11:05.606 --> 01:11:09.264
- I'm just confused.
- About me?

01:11:09.423 --> 01:11:13.242
Yeah, about you, about us.
About this war.

01:11:14.448 --> 01:11:17.273
About this mess that
we found ourselves in.

01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:20.926
The truth is, half the time
I have no idea what I'm doing.

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:24.419
So then, I do these things,
and they don't always mean

01:11:24.521 --> 01:11:27.916
what I think they mean.
Do you know what I mean?

01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:31.718
No, I've no idea what you mean.
- Okay...

01:11:32.543 --> 01:11:36.168
Look, it meant something then
and it does mean something now,

01:11:36.267 --> 01:11:39.795
but... I don't think it means
what you'd wanted it to mean.

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:43.090
- Do you just not like me?
- No, Lee. I like you, okay?

01:11:43.292 --> 01:11:47.086
I like you very much. But right now,
you're driving me crazy.

01:11:50.165 --> 01:11:53.459
<i>I don't know why
I was talking the way I was.</i>

01:11:53.741 --> 01:11:56.479
<i>All I really wanted to do is hold him</i>

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.580
<i>and tell him that everything
is gonna be alright.</i>

01:11:59.994 --> 01:12:02.729
<i>I just didn't know if it was.</i>

01:12:03.096 --> 01:12:05.446
<i>None of us did.</i>

01:12:05.616 --> 01:12:09.847
<i>All we could say for sure was
that for now, we were free.</i>

01:12:10.637 --> 01:12:14.225
<i>But we've done nothing
to earn our freedom.</i>

01:12:16.846 --> 01:12:19.535
<i>Not yet, anyway.</i>

01:12:50.323 --> 01:12:53.862
The way I see it,
these are our choices.

01:12:54.257 --> 01:12:57.431
One: we can sit here
and do nothing.

01:12:57.732 --> 01:13:01.314
Come out when the war's over.
I don't know about you guys...

01:13:01.714 --> 01:13:04.283
but I'm not so good
at doing nothing.

01:13:04.383 --> 01:13:07.152
Two: we can all try to be heroes.

01:13:07.253 --> 01:13:09.598
Rescue our families
from the Showground's.

01:13:09.705 --> 01:13:13.203
But like dr Helpfull said,
we'll probably pay the price.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:19.747
Or three: we can go out there,
at night. Guerilla style.

01:13:19.948 --> 01:13:23.748
Using hit and run tactics
and take back Wirrawee.

01:13:25.631 --> 01:13:28.579
Maybe even help win this thing.
- Yeah, you're right.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.145
We were born here. We know
this country better than they do.

01:13:31.246 --> 01:13:34.346
We can use that to our advantage.
Plant traps, ambush them, pick them off.

01:13:34.465 --> 01:13:37.739
- You're talking about murder.
- It's not murder if it's in a war.

01:13:37.861 --> 01:13:40.672
What about the Bible, "thou shall
not kill". What about that?

01:13:40.773 --> 01:13:44.157
David killed Goliath. -That doesn't
apply in a situation that is a metaphor.

01:13:44.259 --> 01:13:46.951
Do you think it's fair, do you?
- No. -Just let them walk in,

01:13:47.052 --> 01:13:49.752
take everything they want and
our parents worked so hard for?

01:13:49.853 --> 01:13:52.810
No Kevin, I don't think it's fair.
I don't think it's fair at all.

01:13:52.911 --> 01:13:55.773
Are you in or are you out?

01:13:57.124 --> 01:13:59.936
Well, I feel like I should be out.

01:14:00.037 --> 01:14:02.919
But I can't stop thinking
about the coincidence that...

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:06.078
from all the weekends that
we could've chosen to go camping,

01:14:06.178 --> 01:14:10.912
we chose that weekend.
God spared us for a reason.

01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:14.155
And I think he wants us
to do something.

01:14:14.256 --> 01:14:18.733
So I will help you Homer, but
I'm not going to murder anybody.

01:14:18.962 --> 01:14:21.930
All this talk scares me
to death, but...

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.625
I think we have to
fight back anyway.

01:14:25.726 --> 01:14:29.469
We'll never sleep again if we don't.
- We'll never sleep again if we did.

01:14:29.802 --> 01:14:33.002
- What are you chicken, Chris?
- You'd know all about that, wouldn't you?

01:14:33.103 --> 01:14:35.549
There's nothing chicken
about staying alive, mate.

01:14:35.649 --> 01:14:39.344
We're not even trained for this stuff.
What would our parents say?

01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:43.181
They'd say the most important
thing is our safety.

01:14:43.281 --> 01:14:46.854
They wouldn't want us dead
in exchange for them being alive.

01:14:49.774 --> 01:14:54.481
I suppose when the time comes,
I'll do what I have to do.

01:14:55.363 --> 01:14:58.196
What worries me though is that...

01:14:58.304 --> 01:15:02.078
I can't guarantee that I'm not
gonna pack up under pressure.

01:15:02.836 --> 01:15:05.692
I'm so scared and...

01:15:06.484 --> 01:15:10.205
I think that I might just
stand there and scream.

01:15:10.598 --> 01:15:14.648
None of us knows how we're gonna
react when shit hits the fan.

01:15:14.786 --> 01:15:18.986
You've done alright so far.
Well, for a townie.

01:15:21.249 --> 01:15:24.517
We have to do something.
I'm not just gonna sit here.

01:15:24.742 --> 01:15:27.338
And do nothing.

01:15:32.099 --> 01:15:36.470
I'm different to all of you.
I have blood on my hands.

01:15:36.922 --> 01:15:40.180
I can't tell if what I did
was right or wrong.

01:15:40.604 --> 01:15:43.937
I'd like to think it was
to save my friends,

01:15:44.237 --> 01:15:47.677
or as part of some noble
crusade to save my country.

01:15:47.897 --> 01:15:52.762
Really it just comes down to the fact
that I valued my life over theirs.

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:57.865
How many people is it okay to kill
in order to keep me alive?

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:03.947
At what point do we lose our souls,
if we haven't already?

01:16:05.777 --> 01:16:09.433
In the end I think we just
have to trust our instincts.

01:16:09.734 --> 01:16:12.779
After all, it is all
we have left, isn't it?

01:16:13.313 --> 01:16:16.473
What do your instincs tell you?

01:16:26.255 --> 01:16:29.080
That it's time to go to war.

01:16:31.911 --> 01:16:34.964
What are we gonna do?
Blow it up?

01:16:35.254 --> 01:16:38.107
Cobbler's Bay is
one of their key ports.

01:16:38.783 --> 01:16:42.313
And this bridge
is the only way in or out.

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.689
It's the key to everything.

01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:48.224
If they can't resupply their soldiers,
then they can't fight.

01:16:51.667 --> 01:16:55.879
They've got sentries. -We have
to find the way to distract them.

01:16:56.210 --> 01:16:58.742
Remember what dr Clement said?

01:16:58.842 --> 01:17:01.906
About how other people tried to
blow up that bridge before?

01:17:02.007 --> 01:17:04.007
Amateurs.

01:17:05.218 --> 01:17:07.659
Couple of years ago
me and some mates

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.560
came up with the way to take
this bridge down. Just for fun.

01:17:11.773 --> 01:17:14.983
That's hardly reassuring,
knowing your mates.

01:17:17.527 --> 01:17:20.505
Can you drive a petrol tanker?

01:17:34.968 --> 01:17:37.370
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

01:17:53.986 --> 01:17:55.974
Sorry.

01:18:02.083 --> 01:18:04.821
- Big one?
- The big one.

01:18:21.432 --> 01:18:24.360
There! They are there.
In the window.

01:18:31.518 --> 01:18:34.348
Wait! -What?
- Can I do it?

01:18:34.925 --> 01:18:38.011
I've always wanted
to smash a window.

01:18:46.617 --> 01:18:49.053
- One more.
- Fi! Just...

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:53.477
Do it!

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.637
Fi, run!

01:19:36.308 --> 01:19:38.108
Stop!

01:19:38.509 --> 01:19:40.740
Turn around!

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.440
Do not move!

01:20:36.564 --> 01:20:40.300
- Guys, are you there?
- We're all set. We can see you.

01:20:40.432 --> 01:20:44.391
Don't come any closer. Wait there
till we get the word from Homer.

01:20:44.697 --> 01:20:47.718
Lee and me are almost there.
- Lee and "I".

01:20:47.957 --> 01:20:52.165
Okay, we're in the position too.
I can see 10 soldiers on the bridge.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:56.307
We've only got about 15 minutes
before the next convoy comes along.

01:20:57.222 --> 01:21:01.014
We'll call you when we're ready.
- Okay honey, we'll be waiting.

01:21:05.615 --> 01:21:09.278
Did you just call him 'honey'?
- Homer. I called him 'Homer'.

01:21:09.421 --> 01:21:13.585
No, you just called him 'honey'.
- I didn't. -Yes you did, I heard you.

01:21:13.822 --> 01:21:17.891
It may have sounded like 'honey'
but I definitely said 'Homer'.

01:21:18.092 --> 01:21:21.275
- Go. Go.
- You gotta hiss like a snake.

01:21:23.142 --> 01:21:25.950
No, no, like a snake.

01:21:29.078 --> 01:21:34.403
So, princess Fifi has the hots
for a rough as guts Homer.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:39.998
Have you kissed him?
- Would you mind if I had?

01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:43.032
Me? Are you serious?
Of course not.

01:21:43.133 --> 01:21:45.333
I just know that
you two are close.

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:48.324
- No, never like that.
- Okay, good.

01:21:49.734 --> 01:21:52.191
Well then, yes I have.

01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:55.345
Is he a good kisser?

01:21:55.507 --> 01:21:58.550
Actually no, I don't wanna know.
Don't tell me. It's kinda gross.

01:21:58.651 --> 01:22:02.396
- He's a great kisser.
- Great. Now I know.

01:22:09.072 --> 01:22:11.953
But he's so down on himself.

01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:15.021
He's got this weird thing
about my parents being lawyers.

01:22:15.123 --> 01:22:17.328
And he always used
to joke about it.

01:22:17.428 --> 01:22:19.828
But I don't think
he's really joking at all.

01:22:20.038 --> 01:22:23.505
Jesus, Fi, how long did it take to
figure that out? -What do you mean?

01:22:23.607 --> 01:22:26.607
You know the kind of guys
he knocks about. They're just...

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:28.961
more at home hanging out at the pub

01:22:28.962 --> 01:22:31.161
than playing croquet
with your parents.

01:22:31.263 --> 01:22:33.907
My parents don't play croquet.

01:22:34.107 --> 01:22:36.430
Ellie. Ellie!

01:22:36.652 --> 01:22:39.203
Fi! Behind you!

01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:43.335
Homer is like two people.
He's so confident with a group,

01:22:43.436 --> 01:22:47.036
and then he's supershy with me.
I just don't understand.

01:22:47.158 --> 01:22:48.817
Ellie?

01:22:48.818 --> 01:22:52.266
If I could understand Homer
I'm sure I'd understand all guys.

01:22:52.547 --> 01:22:54.767
Like Lee?

01:22:55.887 --> 01:22:59.612
How did you know about that?
- C'mon Ellie, everybody knows.

01:22:59.712 --> 01:23:02.337
God, this is worse than recess.

01:23:02.439 --> 01:23:04.843
They can't hear us.

01:23:05.252 --> 01:23:08.244
Homer, you have to go now.
- But we're still not ready.

01:23:08.345 --> 01:23:12.151
There are soldiers creeping up behind
tanker and Ellie's not answering me.

01:23:12.801 --> 01:23:14.852
Ellie, pick up.

01:23:14.952 --> 01:23:19.475
Just think about it. The eight of us
are living out in the bush.

01:23:19.576 --> 01:23:22.826
And the entire world is
completely turned upside down.

01:23:22.957 --> 01:23:25.247
I'd just hate to be
responsible for ruining

01:23:25.348 --> 01:23:29.048
whatever little good we did have
by Lee and me having a falling out.

01:23:29.249 --> 01:23:33.762
Look, Ellie. I'm no expert
on relationships or anything.

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:36.794
But I do know that
you have this tendency

01:23:36.895 --> 01:23:39.195
to reason everything
through all the time,

01:23:39.303 --> 01:23:42.168
and I just think
the future is the future.

01:23:42.269 --> 01:23:44.778
It has to take care of itself.

01:23:44.879 --> 01:23:47.934
And by the way, it's Lee and 'I'.

01:23:48.335 --> 01:23:50.671
Get out of the truck!

01:23:51.573 --> 01:23:53.860
Move! Drive!

01:23:56.475 --> 01:23:59.411
Here goes the brilliant plan.

01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:06.678
Ellie, I'm so sorry I turned it off.
- Doesn't matter.

01:25:01.079 --> 01:25:02.879
Here.

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:06.080
Go!

01:25:23.383 --> 01:25:26.676
Ellie, we need the lighter.
- You were to bring it.

01:25:26.848 --> 01:25:29.909
No, you were to bring the lighter.

01:25:30.244 --> 01:25:32.680
I don't have it.

01:25:37.181 --> 01:25:39.781
Christ, the soldiers!

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:48.591
Where the hell is Kevin going?

01:25:49.125 --> 01:25:52.966
Robyn, we can't get to you.
- Don't worry about us, just go!

01:26:41.737 --> 01:26:44.391
You guys take this one.
Corrie, you're with me.

01:26:44.492 --> 01:26:47.517
Run Homer, let's go!
Hurry up, they're coming!

01:26:48.097 --> 01:26:50.032
C'mon!

01:26:55.657 --> 01:26:57.449
Kevin!

01:26:59.630 --> 01:27:01.990
Corrie? Corrie!

01:27:13.867 --> 01:27:16.003
Get away!

01:27:26.248 --> 01:27:28.447
Come on.

01:27:31.148 --> 01:27:33.042
Wait!

01:28:33.884 --> 01:28:35.915
Gosh!

01:28:50.333 --> 01:28:54.145
It was so much bigger than I expected.
- That's the biggest joint I've ever lit.

01:28:54.331 --> 01:28:57.090
Did you see the bridge?

01:29:05.258 --> 01:29:08.154
Corrie! Oh my God, what happened?

01:29:08.306 --> 01:29:11.296
She got shot as
we were driving away.

01:29:12.859 --> 01:29:16.708
I can't...
I can't stop the bleeding.

01:29:18.325 --> 01:29:20.736
We'll take her to
go see dr Clement.

01:29:20.836 --> 01:29:23.337
He can fix her the same way
that he fixed Lee.

01:29:23.438 --> 01:29:26.933
- She needs a hospital, Fi.
- I'm gonna get the Landrover.

01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:29.729
- Ellie...
- Hey. Hey!

01:29:30.101 --> 01:29:32.769
You have to leave me.

01:29:33.127 --> 01:29:36.729
No, I'm not leaving you.
- She's right.

01:29:37.465 --> 01:29:41.071
It sounds cruel, but the only thing
to do is ring the bell and run.

01:29:41.173 --> 01:29:43.195
- What?
- No!

01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:47.145
- No I can't leave her. I won't.
- We have to be rational about this.

01:29:47.326 --> 01:29:50.704
If we take her to the hospital,
we will get caught.

01:29:51.183 --> 01:29:54.734
No, I don't give a shit
what's rational. Alright?

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.864
Corrie is our mate.

01:29:58.271 --> 01:30:01.535
She is our mate. And I...

01:30:04.504 --> 01:30:06.964
I love her.

01:30:09.045 --> 01:30:11.686
I'm taking her in.

01:30:12.921 --> 01:30:15.564
I'm staying with her.

01:30:20.383 --> 01:30:22.822
I'm staying.

01:30:30.268 --> 01:30:32.874
Good luck, mate.

01:30:38.825 --> 01:30:42.387
I'll come get you when
you're better. Okay?

01:30:50.893 --> 01:30:53.411
Pinky swear.

01:31:42.589 --> 01:31:45.049
We've hit them.

01:31:45.379 --> 01:31:47.747
Hit them hard.

01:31:47.892 --> 01:31:51.634
They are gonna be coming after us
now with everything they've got.

01:31:52.062 --> 01:31:54.391
<i>And they did come after us.</i>

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:56.654
<i>For three weeks now,
we've seen...</i>

01:31:56.755 --> 01:32:00.229
<i>dozens of planes and helicopters
and search parties.</i>

01:32:01.803 --> 01:32:04.080
<i>But they haven't found us yet.</i>

01:32:04.183 --> 01:32:07.446
<i>Which means Corrie and Kevin
have told them nothing.</i>

01:32:13.258 --> 01:32:16.727
<i>A month ago, we were just
an average bunch of teenagers.</i>

01:32:16.978 --> 01:32:20.406
<i>Studying for school and
complaining about our parents.</i>

01:32:32.192 --> 01:32:34.630
<i>Now we're soldiers.</i>

01:32:34.731 --> 01:32:38.131
<i>Trapped behind enemy lines
and fighting to survive.</i>

01:32:39.054 --> 01:32:42.169
<i>We won't run.
We won't hide.</i>

01:32:42.848 --> 01:32:45.828
<i>We'll fight and keep fighting.</i>

01:32:46.068 --> 01:32:48.630
<i>And never give up.</i>

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.131
<i>Until this war is finally won.</i>

01:32:53.305 --> 01:32:59.452
