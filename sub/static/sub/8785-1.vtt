WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:03.570
What, did they say
you'd never walk again or something?

00:08.817 --> 00:11.047
I was never much good
at being told what I couldn't do.

00:12.721 --> 00:16.748
But I was in hospital
for a year just flat on my back.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.863
I hate hospitals.

00:26.902 --> 00:30.463
My teammates
would come and visit in the beginning,

00:32.141 --> 00:33.233
but after a while,

00:34.743 --> 00:36.677
I was just a reminder
of what could happen to them.

00:38.647 --> 00:39.944
Bad fall,

00:40.048 --> 00:43.916
get hit in the wrong place,
never play rugby again.

00:47.489 --> 00:48.956
Anyway,

00:49.057 --> 00:50.888
trekking around for a while

00:50.993 --> 00:52.187
just seemed like
the best way back.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:06.275 --> 01:07.640
You miss your mum.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.017
I can't find my way back.

01:24.259 --> 01:27.922
I went to the hospital
to see her every day she was there.

01:30.165 --> 01:31.564
Almost two years.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.333
That's a long time.

01:37.339 --> 01:38.499
Not long enough.

01:46.048 --> 01:50.542
Everyone was so nice,
and understanding, and comforting, and...

01:52.154 --> 01:54.088
I just wanted to scream.

01:58.694 --> 01:59.683
Do it.

02:02.598 --> 02:04.862
Go on. Scream.

02:05.367 --> 02:06.425
Just do it.

02:07.035 --> 02:09.026
Look, I won't even listen.
I won't listen.

02:20.449 --> 02:21.643
I can't.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.221
Come on, hit the ball.
Cordelia!

03:03.725 --> 03:05.124
- What?
- The ball. Take it!

03:05.527 --> 03:07.119
<i>This is Cordelia.</i>

03:09.264 --> 03:10.458
<i>Hello?</i>

03:13.502 --> 03:14.662
<i>Hello?</i>

03:19.441 --> 03:20.806
<i>Who is this?</i>

03:25.280 --> 03:27.373
Is it all right if I take her?
I'd love to brush her down.

03:27.482 --> 03:29.347
- Really?
- Yeah, I've got her.

03:31.019 --> 03:32.043
Odd.

03:32.321 --> 03:34.118
You've never been one
to clear up after yourself.

03:35.624 --> 03:37.615
A new leaf, a new me.

03:38.293 --> 03:39.760
It appears
you've made a friend.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.654
I know.
Isn't she a beauty?

03:43.732 --> 03:45.723
Remember that
darling pony you had as a girl?

03:46.335 --> 03:47.962
What was its name again?

03:51.273 --> 03:53.434
My childhood, please!
You know I never look back.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.173
Oh, you remember
the black one

03:55.277 --> 03:57.040
with the little white
star on his forehead.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.144
Yes. Uh...

04:00.248 --> 04:02.512
The one with the star.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.448
I called him Blaze.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.413
Blaze?

04:07.823 --> 04:09.882
I really should get her
back to the stables, so...

04:11.193 --> 04:13.127
The resemblance
is astonishing.

04:14.262 --> 04:15.991
But Cordelia rides
English saddle.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.490
And you, if I'm not mistaken,
were taught to ride Western.

04:20.402 --> 04:21.834
Heaven forbid.

04:21.937 --> 04:23.734
I'm just a little
out of practice, that's all.

04:23.939 --> 04:26.407
Well, this is a new low
even for Cordelia.

04:27.342 --> 04:30.140
To hire a look-alike
to stand in her stead

04:30.245 --> 04:33.112
at a charity event
organized just for her

04:33.215 --> 04:35.183
while she's off partying.

04:35.417 --> 04:36.816
I don't know
if it's the champagne

04:36.918 --> 04:38.146
or the sunlight
that's got to you.

04:38.253 --> 04:40.585
Oh, I will call
security immediately.

04:40.689 --> 04:43.715
No, you can't.
The charity!

04:45.127 --> 04:46.594
Look, I promise you

04:46.695 --> 04:49.391
that I will do whatever is
expected of Cordelia tomorrow.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.232
I'm not about to
stand in the way of helping those kids.

04:54.369 --> 04:55.427
Are you?

04:57.873 --> 04:58.931
Alicia.

05:02.310 --> 05:04.437
No one must ever know.
Is that clear?

05:04.546 --> 05:05.706
Crystal.

05:05.881 --> 05:08.247
Here you are.
What a wonderful match.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.312
I was just
congratulating Cordelia.

05:11.653 --> 05:12.950
The ambassador
is ready for us.

05:13.054 --> 05:14.487
Oh. Shall we?

05:16.691 --> 05:20.252
If you muck this up,
you will have me to answer to.

05:20.729 --> 05:23.254
Both of you.
Pass it on.

05:37.813 --> 05:38.802
Oh.

05:48.023 --> 05:50.082
Bling, bling, bling, bling,
bling, bling, bling...

06:03.004 --> 06:04.938
Who are you
hiding from?

06:05.974 --> 06:06.998
Hey.

06:21.857 --> 06:23.290
You ride very well.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.554
It's one of the two things
my father taught me.

06:28.163 --> 06:29.289
And the other?

06:37.672 --> 06:39.799
It's actually more handy
than you might think.

06:43.912 --> 06:46.107
No, here. Put your
fingers like this

06:50.051 --> 06:52.747
and now curl your
tongue like that.

06:55.090 --> 06:56.387
Now you try.

07:00.862 --> 07:02.420
That's terrible.

07:02.864 --> 07:04.354
Well, I'll work on it.

07:04.833 --> 07:06.130
I think you should.

07:14.442 --> 07:15.670
You're not what
I expected.

07:16.344 --> 07:17.402
No?

07:17.512 --> 07:18.740
You're different.

07:20.215 --> 07:21.239
Different?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.212
Different is good.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.180
Is it?

07:27.522 --> 07:29.183
You make me think it is.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.485
You make me
feel different.

07:33.962 --> 07:35.054
Sorry.

07:35.363 --> 07:36.387
Why?

07:36.865 --> 07:38.162
Mostly I always
feel the same.

07:38.934 --> 07:42.335
Same people,
same conversations, same parties.

07:43.905 --> 07:45.463
None of it means anything.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.433
But you help people.

07:49.144 --> 07:51.840
I mean,
you're raising money, building schools.

07:53.548 --> 07:55.448
I wish I were part of
something that important.

07:56.384 --> 07:58.284
But that's my father.
That's not me.

08:00.322 --> 08:01.812
I do nothing.

08:01.923 --> 08:03.891
I've never been
to those schools.

08:03.992 --> 08:06.517
I've never been
to Africa, to Romania.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.186
I'm only faking
my way through.

08:09.898 --> 08:11.331
I know what
that feels like.

08:13.768 --> 08:15.133
But there is nothing
fake about you.

08:20.675 --> 08:22.836
I want to
show you something.

08:31.486 --> 08:35.547
<i>You call me a mountain</i>

08:37.192 --> 08:40.855
<i>And I call you the sea</i>

08:43.398 --> 08:48.961
<i>You can move me</i>
<i>if you want to...</i>

08:49.771 --> 08:51.068
Thank you.

09:07.522 --> 09:09.319
And then we're gonna go
meet his friends

09:09.424 --> 09:10.948
and then we're
gonna go dancing!

09:11.059 --> 09:13.118
Meg, what has
gotten into you?

09:13.228 --> 09:14.388
I know.

09:20.335 --> 09:21.632
I'm sorry.

09:24.205 --> 09:25.399
Me, too.

09:27.876 --> 09:29.571
Oh.

09:32.714 --> 09:33.738
Hey, mate.

09:46.227 --> 09:47.285
What?

09:47.562 --> 09:48.859
The necklace.

09:51.032 --> 09:52.932
There's the Meg
that I know.

09:53.034 --> 09:54.365
What were you thinking?

09:55.704 --> 09:56.864
Stay classy, Meg.

10:07.415 --> 10:08.439
You good?

10:09.684 --> 10:11.515
Yeah. I'm perfect.

10:34.776 --> 10:36.266
First class.

10:39.848 --> 10:44.615
<i>Relax, take it easy</i>

10:44.719 --> 10:47.779
<i>For there is nothing</i>
<i>that we can do</i>

10:47.889 --> 10:52.849
<i>Relax, take it easy</i>

10:52.961 --> 10:55.589
<i>Blame it on me</i>
<i>or blame it on you</i>

10:55.697 --> 10:58.461
<i>Relax, take it easy</i>

11:25.860 --> 11:27.122
Jerome.

11:37.605 --> 11:38.731
<i>Merci.</i>

11:41.142 --> 11:42.439
Excuse me.

11:45.847 --> 11:47.144
There are people for that.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.309
Yeah, I know.

12:09.204 --> 12:10.831
Give me your hand.

12:11.906 --> 12:13.203
Thank you.

12:17.545 --> 12:18.569
Wow.

12:33.194 --> 12:34.627
I'm trying
to impress you.

12:34.729 --> 12:36.822
Mmm. So far, so good.

12:52.080 --> 12:56.676
When I was little,
I had a snow globe of the Eiffel Tower,

12:57.952 --> 13:00.352
and when you
wound it up it played

13:00.455 --> 13:01.945
<i>La Vie En Rose.</i>

13:06.160 --> 13:08.651
And when I shook it,
the snow inside sparkled.

13:16.671 --> 13:20.698
<i>When you kiss me, heaven sighs</i>

13:20.808 --> 13:22.298
It was magical.

13:23.978 --> 13:25.036
Just like this.

13:25.146 --> 13:29.310
<i>I see la vie en rose</i>

13:29.417 --> 13:30.441
Just wait.

13:30.551 --> 13:34.510
<i>When you press me</i>
<i>to your heart</i>

13:35.189 --> 13:38.420
<i>I'm in a world apart</i>

13:38.526 --> 13:42.428
<i>A world where roses bloom</i>

13:43.865 --> 13:45.355
<i>And when you speak</i>

13:45.633 --> 13:47.498
Look at this one.

13:47.602 --> 13:50.799
<i>Angels sing from above</i>

13:51.339 --> 13:56.743
<i>Everyday words seem</i>
<i>to turn into love songs</i>

13:58.279 --> 14:00.042
This is amazing!

14:02.517 --> 14:06.385
<i>And life will always be</i>

14:06.487 --> 14:09.513
<i>La vie en rose</i>

15:05.346 --> 15:07.439
I had a lovely time tonight.

15:09.484 --> 15:10.849
Me, too, Cordelia.

15:17.358 --> 15:19.349
Theo, I need to
tell you something.

15:19.861 --> 15:21.021
Yeah, sure, please.

15:24.832 --> 15:26.424
Hi, good evening.

15:29.337 --> 15:30.827
Maybe tomorrow.

15:32.273 --> 15:34.241
All right, then tomorrow.

15:34.675 --> 15:36.302
I'll see you
at the auction, all right?

15:36.411 --> 15:37.378
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

15:38.212 --> 15:39.338
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

15:56.181 --> 15:57.239
Emma?

15:57.582 --> 15:58.947
I'm in here.

16:11.329 --> 16:12.387
Hey.
- Hey.

16:15.734 --> 16:16.962
Domenico?

16:17.335 --> 16:18.529
Mmm-hmm.

16:22.174 --> 16:23.436
What are you watching?

16:27.312 --> 16:28.677
Grace Kelly.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.715
You know how on
Hastings Avenue,

16:38.824 --> 16:40.689
how all the houses
are set way back?

16:43.295 --> 16:47.459
With the front walks
and big lawns and driveways.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.234
I always wondered about
the kind of people that lived there.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.633
You know,
the kind of people with

16:59.744 --> 17:01.336
the dimmer switches
on their lights.

17:05.383 --> 17:06.849
I thought Owen
and I were gonna

17:06.952 --> 17:08.442
live in a house
like that one day.

17:10.888 --> 17:12.584
It's crazy.

17:13.525 --> 17:15.015
It's not crazy.

17:15.926 --> 17:17.223
So stupid.

17:20.298 --> 17:22.266
I don't need a fancy house.

17:25.604 --> 17:27.195
I just need Owen.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.310
Grace, what if I blew it?

17:35.380 --> 17:36.540
Emma...

17:39.484 --> 17:40.678
Oh, hey.

17:41.820 --> 17:44.015
Hey, don't you
worry about it.

17:45.090 --> 17:46.148
Okay?

17:46.791 --> 17:48.418
We'll work it out.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.324
We always do.

17:51.263 --> 17:53.197
I know. I know you will.

17:56.101 --> 17:57.261
Then what?

18:00.171 --> 18:01.399
I just...

18:05.176 --> 18:08.612
I finally meet a guy
who likes me for me,

18:10.515 --> 18:12.244
and I'm not even me.

18:15.987 --> 18:18.319
But I feel like I am
when I'm with him.

18:20.659 --> 18:22.820
If Theo finds out,
he's gonna hate me.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.456
Grace, trust me.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.065
Once he knows the real you,

18:31.169 --> 18:33.000
the Grace that I know,

18:35.173 --> 18:36.902
he's just gonna know
how lucky he is.

18:40.845 --> 18:41.869
You think?

18:42.547 --> 18:44.845
I knew it
from the minute I laid eyes on you.

18:50.021 --> 18:51.682
You're going places, kid.

18:58.797 --> 18:59.855
Wait.

19:01.032 --> 19:02.397
Where's Meg?

19:06.304 --> 19:07.532
Close your eyes.

19:08.807 --> 19:10.297
Do it.

19:15.046 --> 19:16.274
Where did you find that?

19:17.248 --> 19:18.442
For you.

19:28.760 --> 19:29.852
Hmm.

19:30.061 --> 19:31.289
Now, run.

19:32.497 --> 19:33.486
Hey!

20:44.869 --> 20:46.496
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- <i>Bonjour.</i>

20:59.884 --> 21:01.215
This is me.

21:02.187 --> 21:04.178
Back up to
the old Grimaldi Suite.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.380
You're staying here?

21:08.493 --> 21:11.189
Yeah. Sort of an upgrade.

21:13.498 --> 21:15.125
Offer stands, Meg.

21:16.768 --> 21:18.497
It's not as posh as this.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.203
There's a place in Tuscany.

21:24.008 --> 21:25.737
You just pitch your tent
right on the beach.

21:27.312 --> 21:28.301
And

21:29.347 --> 21:30.405
the company is good.

21:34.452 --> 21:35.885
I wish I could.

21:41.526 --> 21:43.460
The train leaves at noon
if you change your mind.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.892
Change your mind.

22:03.715 --> 22:05.307
Have a nice trip.

22:14.192 --> 22:15.659
You, too, Meg.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.964
Meg? Meg?

23:01.105 --> 23:02.129
Hey!

23:04.876 --> 23:05.934
Where have you been?

23:06.044 --> 23:09.104
Will you relax?
It's okay, she is right here.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.510
The article said
millions, Emma.

23:11.983 --> 23:13.951
Yeah, I heard you
the first hundred times.

23:14.052 --> 23:15.383
On my neck.

23:15.587 --> 23:17.817
I'm not going to
relax until that thing is back in its case.

23:17.956 --> 23:19.514
What is going on
with you two?

23:19.958 --> 23:21.118
Can you please just
give her the necklace?

23:21.593 --> 23:22.617
What necklace?

23:28.433 --> 23:30.526
Oh! Riley!

23:31.803 --> 23:34.431
It's in his backpack.
I put it in his backpack to be safe!

23:35.807 --> 23:37.138
Backpack? Wait!

23:37.475 --> 23:38.806
Wait! What?

23:38.943 --> 23:39.910
Whose backpack?

23:40.011 --> 23:41.106
Riley's.

23:41.379 --> 23:43.779
Okay, so Riley has it.
Where is he staying?

23:43.915 --> 23:45.610
He's not. He's gone.

23:45.717 --> 23:46.843
He stole the necklace?

23:47.018 --> 23:49.009
No, Emma,
he didn't steal anything.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.280
He's getting on
a train to Italy.

23:50.388 --> 23:51.446
Are you kidding me?

23:51.789 --> 23:52.756
At noon.

23:55.727 --> 23:57.194
How far is the train station
from here?

23:57.729 --> 23:59.560
Cordelia! Cordelia!

24:08.072 --> 24:09.198
Oh, hey,
what's she doing here?

24:22.687 --> 24:24.780
Oh! <i>Mademoiselle</i> Scott.

24:25.523 --> 24:26.820
Room key.

24:29.727 --> 24:30.921
Faster.

24:45.710 --> 24:46.768
Sorry.

24:46.878 --> 24:48.175
Pillow, there.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.746
Now the blankets.

24:59.424 --> 25:00.755
Nobody in Majorca
knew...

25:03.461 --> 25:04.450
Cordelia?

25:04.662 --> 25:05.822
Right.

25:06.798 --> 25:07.992
Cordelia.

25:08.099 --> 25:10.158
Hold on, Victoria.

25:10.835 --> 25:11.859
Yes?

25:19.811 --> 25:21.244
Good morning.

25:29.887 --> 25:32.048
Forgot how I hate the French.

25:33.224 --> 25:35.021
Do not even think about it.

25:49.007 --> 25:50.235
Shanghai?

25:51.309 --> 25:53.402
Well, can you wait for me?

26:02.453 --> 26:04.683
I just have this
tiresome auction I have to deal with.

26:09.627 --> 26:11.117
I suppose it...

26:20.004 --> 26:21.699
Well, let's just...

26:25.877 --> 26:27.674
I was meant to have a suite.

26:33.951 --> 26:35.179
Put those in there.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.651
Wait. Wait.

26:48.666 --> 26:50.065
Stavros is supposed
to be here, isn't he?

26:50.735 --> 26:51.997
I don't see his boat.

27:00.378 --> 27:01.936
He's in Mykonos.

27:02.313 --> 27:04.144
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

27:04.615 --> 27:05.809
Hold on.

27:17.395 --> 27:18.419
Yes?

27:21.365 --> 27:23.128
If you have finished,
you may go.

27:26.137 --> 27:29.595
If you have finished,
you may go.

27:36.714 --> 27:38.341
- Emma, go.
- No, I can't move.

27:38.449 --> 27:39.643
- Move!
- You have to go!

27:39.750 --> 27:41.047
Do it! Go.

27:41.652 --> 27:43.677
Okay, okay.

27:45.289 --> 27:46.813
Oh, God.

27:52.730 --> 27:54.197
- Don't look down.
- I'm sorry.

27:54.832 --> 27:56.493
I looked down.

28:04.876 --> 28:06.104
Okay.

28:07.178 --> 28:08.941
I can't breathe,
I can't breathe, I can't breathe.

28:09.046 --> 28:10.308
Emma, stop it. It's over!

28:10.414 --> 28:11.813
Calm down. Shh!

28:13.017 --> 28:14.416
It's locked.

28:15.119 --> 28:16.313
Come on.

28:20.858 --> 28:21.916
It's locked, too!

28:27.565 --> 28:28.896
Oh, no.

28:29.367 --> 28:31.096
No, no, no. Meg!

28:41.078 --> 28:42.045
Wait, no!

28:42.146 --> 28:43.306
Wait!

28:43.414 --> 28:45.143
No, no, no! Wait!

28:45.249 --> 28:46.580
No! No!

28:51.556 --> 28:53.023
- The train.
- The necklace.

28:53.124 --> 28:54.318
Riley.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.291
Yes, I'm here, Mother.

28:58.596 --> 29:01.190
So unfair.
I never get to see my friends.

29:01.699 --> 29:03.166
I never do what I want.

29:04.468 --> 29:06.368
When is it
going to be my turn?

29:11.776 --> 29:12.834
Ugh!

29:40.071 --> 29:41.538
You know what?

29:41.906 --> 29:43.373
Let's just get
on a train and go.

29:44.809 --> 29:46.003
I can't.

29:46.510 --> 29:49.741
I pretended to be
that girl and now I lost her necklace.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.370
You didn't lose
her necklace.

29:51.482 --> 29:52.449
I did.

29:52.550 --> 29:53.539
No, I did.

29:53.651 --> 29:55.016
Well, I lied

29:55.586 --> 29:58.578
to Theo, about everything.

30:04.028 --> 30:05.188
I have to go back.

30:07.031 --> 30:08.692
- What?
- I have to fix this.

30:10.034 --> 30:11.194
Or at least try.

30:12.670 --> 30:13.728
Okay.

30:14.538 --> 30:16.130
Okay, we go back.

30:17.041 --> 30:19.441
We'll explain.
Maybe she'll understand.

30:20.411 --> 30:21.742
Fat chance.

30:22.713 --> 30:24.078
Could you be
a little positive?

30:25.583 --> 30:28.051
One night out
and look at you.

30:47.138 --> 30:48.696
Cheers, mate.

30:54.178 --> 30:56.169
Excuse me, excuse me.

30:56.747 --> 30:58.305
I was wondering
if you could tell me

30:58.416 --> 30:59.644
where the Grimaldi
Suite is, please.

30:59.850 --> 31:01.442
Pardon.

31:01.986 --> 31:03.044
Hello?

31:03.154 --> 31:04.519
This is Cordelia
Winthrop Scott.

31:04.622 --> 31:05.714
I've been robbed.
Call the police.

31:06.857 --> 31:08.688
Robbed! I will call <i>securité.</i>

31:08.793 --> 31:10.420
No, I said police!
Call the police!

31:10.594 --> 31:11.652
Yes, <i>securité.</i>

31:11.962 --> 31:13.554
No, I said police!
Call the...

31:13.664 --> 31:15.097
Oh, forget it!
I'll do it myself!

31:21.872 --> 31:23.271
<i>Securité.</i>

31:28.746 --> 31:29.974
<i>Securité.</i>

31:49.633 --> 31:50.930
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Scott?

31:51.068 --> 31:52.399
- Hello, Francois.
- Hi.

31:52.503 --> 31:54.130
You still need <i>securité?</i>

31:54.238 --> 31:55.637
No, no, no.

31:55.740 --> 31:56.866
You're still robbed?

31:57.441 --> 31:58.965
No, no, no.

32:00.378 --> 32:01.640
- That's crazy.
- Yeah!

32:01.746 --> 32:04.840
Police? I'm calling
to report a robbery at the Hotel de Paris.

32:05.916 --> 32:07.781
This is Cordelia
Winthrop Scott.

32:07.885 --> 32:08.909
Someone has been robbed?

32:09.019 --> 32:10.350
No, nobody.

32:10.721 --> 32:13.622
Theo! Nobody has been robbed.
We're all right.

32:14.091 --> 32:15.058
But you...

32:15.159 --> 32:16.524
How are you?

32:17.995 --> 32:19.223
Are you teasing me?

32:20.231 --> 32:21.289
Teasing you? No.

32:21.399 --> 32:23.026
Well, because this
feels like a game.

32:25.035 --> 32:27.026
It's not a game.
Not to me.

32:28.105 --> 32:30.733
But I do need to
tell you something.

32:30.841 --> 32:31.830
And she will.

32:31.942 --> 32:33.068
Later.

32:33.511 --> 32:34.535
But the auction!

32:34.645 --> 32:35.634
Back in 10.

32:35.746 --> 32:36.735
Oh.

32:38.549 --> 32:39.675
I'll be right back.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.178
Okay?

32:48.692 --> 32:51.525
It starts in five minutes.
Ladies, five minutes.

32:57.968 --> 32:59.196
I don't understand women.

33:07.511 --> 33:09.240
Perfectly good pear.

33:17.288 --> 33:18.550
Grimaldi.

33:20.925 --> 33:21.892
Riley!

33:22.693 --> 33:23.717
Meg!

33:24.028 --> 33:25.154
The necklace!

33:25.262 --> 33:26.354
Do not touch that bell!

33:41.011 --> 33:42.376
<i>Bonjour.</i>

33:42.546 --> 33:44.343
Hi. I need to find this girl.

33:46.450 --> 33:47.644
Have you seen her?

33:49.186 --> 33:50.210
<i>Oui.</i>

33:51.188 --> 33:52.177
You came back.

33:52.790 --> 33:54.223
I found your necklace.

33:54.792 --> 33:56.384
Thought it was
a pretty good excuse for a second shot.

34:01.765 --> 34:02.857
Wait for me in the lobby.

34:02.967 --> 34:03.956
You got it.

34:04.068 --> 34:05.865
- Don't leave.
- I'm not going anywhere.

34:25.489 --> 34:26.547
Pardon me.

34:26.657 --> 34:27.748
Hold on one second
there, boss.

34:27.858 --> 34:30.018
You're telling me
that Emma is staying here?

34:30.127 --> 34:32.254
I told you this.
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Scott's friend.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.056
Now, pardon.

34:35.466 --> 34:36.933
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

34:52.315 --> 34:53.612
Finally...

34:56.487 --> 34:57.977
We can explain.

35:08.465 --> 35:09.989
- Listen...
- Save your sorries for the police.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.533
Wait, wait.
The police?

35:11.635 --> 35:12.795
Oh, please!

35:12.903 --> 35:14.598
But it's right here.
I have it.

35:14.705 --> 35:15.967
Exactly! You have it!

35:16.073 --> 35:18.007
Look,
this wasn't planned.

35:18.108 --> 35:20.133
It's just a case of
mistaken identity.

35:23.447 --> 35:25.244
It's impersonation
and it's a crime,

35:25.349 --> 35:26.976
one I'm putting
a stop to this instant.

35:27.318 --> 35:28.410
- But the auction...
- Oh!

35:29.520 --> 35:32.216
Let me assure you
that there will be no auction now.

35:32.456 --> 35:34.720
Hey! People are
counting on her!

35:34.858 --> 35:37.486
Or on you... What?

35:37.595 --> 35:39.062
That's not my problem.

35:41.465 --> 35:42.955
Don't touch the phone.

35:43.801 --> 35:44.995
Or what?

35:48.405 --> 35:50.532
I promise you it
is a false alarm.

35:50.641 --> 35:51.733
She said
everything was fine.

35:51.842 --> 35:52.809
<i>Quoi?</i>

35:53.978 --> 35:54.945
But why am I speaking English?

35:55.045 --> 35:56.307
No!

35:58.415 --> 36:00.246
You let me up.

36:00.551 --> 36:02.178
Now what do we do?

36:02.620 --> 36:04.451
- Cordelia?
- <i>Mademoiselle?</i>

36:04.722 --> 36:05.814
Help! Mmm!

36:09.493 --> 36:11.688
<i>Mademoiselle,</i>
open the door!

36:11.795 --> 36:13.695
Just a minute.

36:13.797 --> 36:14.855
Give me the...

36:21.338 --> 36:22.396
<i>Bonjour.</i>

36:22.640 --> 36:23.607
- Hello.
- Hi.

36:24.041 --> 36:25.099
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

36:26.043 --> 36:28.841
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>
We had a call. There was a robbery?

36:28.946 --> 36:31.005
Oh, no.
A misunderstanding.

36:31.115 --> 36:32.309
You see?

36:32.416 --> 36:33.747
Yes, she couldn't
find her necklace.

36:33.851 --> 36:34.875
What? Where is she?

36:34.985 --> 36:35.974
I'm right here.

36:36.086 --> 36:37.075
There she is.

36:37.187 --> 36:38.347
<i>Bonjour,</i>
<i>mademoiselle.</i>

36:38.455 --> 36:39.649
<i>Bonjour.</i>

36:42.292 --> 36:44.624
Theo, could you help me?

36:45.729 --> 36:47.162
I can't quite
manage the clasp.

36:48.799 --> 36:50.164
But tell me,
we heard a scream.

36:51.935 --> 36:52.924
Oh!

36:54.104 --> 36:56.436
When she found
the necklace,

36:58.542 --> 37:02.501
right now,
she was so, so happy.

37:03.881 --> 37:05.246
What's going on here?

37:07.551 --> 37:08.779
Relieved.

37:09.253 --> 37:10.277
Oh, really?

37:10.454 --> 37:12.786
Yes, I'm very sorry
to have wasted your time.

37:18.262 --> 37:19.320
Well,

37:19.830 --> 37:22.731
allow me to escort you,
<i>mademoiselle,</i> you know, as a precaution.

37:23.534 --> 37:25.832
Would you?
I'm afraid I'm already late.

37:26.003 --> 37:27.630
Right, Theo? Theo?

37:28.172 --> 37:29.434
Coming, Meg?

37:29.540 --> 37:30.564
Yes.

37:32.409 --> 37:34.172
Right behind you.

37:43.987 --> 37:45.045
How's it going in here?

37:45.155 --> 37:46.713
Oh, we're good.

37:46.824 --> 37:47.950
Just getting acquainted.

37:49.026 --> 37:50.493
We will...

37:51.161 --> 37:53.721
We'll let you go
as soon as the auction is over.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.792
Be right back.

38:05.442 --> 38:06.704
Oh, come on.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.106
Come on.

38:11.648 --> 38:12.808
Promise

38:15.552 --> 38:17.383
that whatever happens,

38:19.089 --> 38:21.557
you'll think of the girl
you showed the fireworks to.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.627
That was me.

38:34.271 --> 38:37.434
Grace? Meg!

38:37.674 --> 38:39.266
Owen! What are you doing here?

38:40.077 --> 38:42.170
What's with...
Where's Emma?

38:42.446 --> 38:43.674
She's upstairs.

38:44.181 --> 38:45.648
Meg, is everything all right?

38:45.783 --> 38:47.114
Yeah, everything's fine.

38:47.317 --> 38:48.375
Where upstairs?

38:48.485 --> 38:49.952
Trust me, you don't
want to go up there.

38:50.554 --> 38:51.953
- Meg?
- Yes?

38:52.256 --> 38:53.416
- Are you coming?
- Coming.

38:53.590 --> 38:54.887
Why is she talking
like that?

38:54.992 --> 38:56.152
She's not.

38:56.260 --> 38:58.057
Please, both of you,
just stay here.

39:01.365 --> 39:02.332
Hey, mate.

39:03.667 --> 39:05.328
Third floor.
Grimaldi Suite.

39:06.837 --> 39:08.134
What did you tell him?

39:08.238 --> 39:09.500
It's fine,
he's waiting with Riley.

39:09.606 --> 39:11.540
Miss Cordelia Winthrop Scott.

39:17.748 --> 39:18.976
We've got this.

39:23.687 --> 39:25.712
I'm really glad
you came, Meg.

39:27.891 --> 39:29.552
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

39:37.901 --> 39:39.835
You will never
get away with this.

39:41.738 --> 39:44.434
Honey, we've been
getting away with this for days.

39:49.346 --> 39:50.711
You... What?

39:51.915 --> 39:53.507
Don't mess with Texas.

40:02.092 --> 40:03.081
Emma.

40:03.227 --> 40:04.285
Owen?

40:05.295 --> 40:06.694
- What are you...
- What are you doing here?

40:06.797 --> 40:08.389
What am I doing here?

40:10.300 --> 40:12.131
What am I doing here?
I've been

40:12.236 --> 40:13.794
running all over
Paris looking for you.

40:15.839 --> 40:16.828
Hi.

40:17.274 --> 40:18.263
Hi.

40:19.576 --> 40:21.305
1,000,000 euros.

40:21.411 --> 40:22.708
1,500,000.

40:24.615 --> 40:26.640
We have a bid for 1.5.

40:26.850 --> 40:28.147
1,700,000.

40:29.453 --> 40:30.545
Marvelous!

40:31.321 --> 40:32.845
1,700,000.

40:35.425 --> 40:36.892
Do I hear two?

40:42.532 --> 40:44.466
You went all the way
to Paris for me?

40:47.371 --> 40:48.702
I don't want to
lose you, Emma.

40:51.008 --> 40:52.873
Maybe I was trying
to fence you in a bit.

40:53.877 --> 40:55.367
Guess I was just worried

40:55.479 --> 40:57.470
that once you saw
everything there was to see here,

40:57.581 --> 40:58.570
you wouldn't come back.

40:58.682 --> 40:59.842
Owen...

40:59.950 --> 41:02.009
And look,
I'm sorry for that,

41:02.119 --> 41:04.110
because I don't ever want to keep
you from something better.

41:05.622 --> 41:07.681
Emma,
you deserve the best.

41:10.794 --> 41:12.887
But I already
have the best.

41:17.401 --> 41:18.459
Yeah?

41:19.102 --> 41:20.228
Yeah.

41:25.676 --> 41:26.643
What was that?

41:27.911 --> 41:30.880
So, Paris. It's pretty
awesome, right?

41:30.981 --> 41:32.107
What was that?

41:32.215 --> 41:33.273
- What was what, honey?
- You heard it.

41:33.383 --> 41:34.941
- No, I didn't.
- Is someone in there?

41:35.919 --> 41:38.080
What? Is someone
in here? No.

41:38.855 --> 41:40.254
Emma, what's going on?

41:41.124 --> 41:42.182
Oh, shoot.

41:42.292 --> 41:43.657
Grace?

41:45.429 --> 41:47.056
We have a bid for 2.5.

41:49.633 --> 41:51.567
Who will bid 3,000,000 euros?

41:54.104 --> 41:55.264
Anyone?

41:56.073 --> 41:57.370
It's too much.

41:57.774 --> 42:00.834
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,</i>
who will take us to 3,000,000?

42:03.580 --> 42:04.808
Can I have...

42:04.915 --> 42:06.041
Please, I'm sorry.

42:06.616 --> 42:07.640
But,

42:08.352 --> 42:09.717
my dear, what is wrong?

42:15.359 --> 42:16.792
It's okay.

42:18.829 --> 42:20.319
There's something
I need to say.

42:20.430 --> 42:21.397
Of course.

42:21.732 --> 42:23.029
What is it, Cordelia?

42:25.902 --> 42:27.369
Gandhi once said...

42:27.471 --> 42:28.631
Gandhi?

42:28.972 --> 42:31.839
...that you must be
the change you wish

42:33.410 --> 42:34.570
to see.

42:35.078 --> 42:36.705
This necklace isn't mine.

42:39.016 --> 42:40.483
No, it's mine.

42:43.553 --> 42:45.111
Arrest her,
she's an imposter.

42:47.891 --> 42:48.915
Arrest her.

42:49.026 --> 42:51.256
It's true.
I'm not Cordelia Scott.

42:51.795 --> 42:53.023
There, you see?

42:55.232 --> 42:57.427
I'm just
a regular girl from Texas.

43:01.671 --> 43:03.366
I'm no one special,

43:04.141 --> 43:06.200
but I had
the chance to be,

43:07.210 --> 43:09.371
even if it was
only for a minute, and I took it.

43:10.080 --> 43:11.377
We all did.

43:11.481 --> 43:12.812
And we're sorry.

43:13.984 --> 43:15.383
I know what
I did was wrong

43:15.485 --> 43:17.851
and I don't expect
you to forgive me.

43:20.991 --> 43:22.686
But it wasn't
all a lie.

43:23.727 --> 43:25.456
I thought you
were different.

43:33.003 --> 43:34.994
$3,000,000.

43:35.138 --> 43:36.196
Owen.

43:38.875 --> 43:40.536
We're from Texas,
we go big.

43:40.644 --> 43:42.111
He doesn't have
any money.

43:42.212 --> 43:43.941
Look at them,
none of them do.

43:44.047 --> 43:45.674
- Arrest them.
- It's okay.

43:45.816 --> 43:47.511
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean...

43:47.617 --> 43:50.142
Look, you all
came here to help those kids.

43:50.253 --> 43:53.381
Please don't let my mistake
get in the way of that.

43:55.725 --> 43:57.454
I may not
deserve your help,

43:59.196 --> 44:00.561
but they do.

44:02.466 --> 44:04.195
6,000,000 euros.

44:06.636 --> 44:09.400
I would like to
bid 6,000,000 euros

44:10.040 --> 44:11.098
for the necklace...

44:11.208 --> 44:12.402
Aunt Alicia?

44:12.509 --> 44:13.840
...on that young
woman's neck,

44:15.212 --> 44:16.440
whomever she may be.

44:18.281 --> 44:19.509
What are you doing?

44:19.616 --> 44:22.278
I'm doing precisely
as she has asked.

44:24.621 --> 44:26.020
I'm helping.

44:27.090 --> 44:30.184
Sold for 6,000,000 euros
to one Miss Scott.

44:31.194 --> 44:32.388
Yeah!

44:32.529 --> 44:34.053
No! But?

44:48.445 --> 44:49.503
Thank you.

44:51.548 --> 44:53.482
Why are you just
standing there? Arrest them!

44:53.583 --> 44:55.380
For what?
They seem very nice.

44:55.485 --> 44:56.645
They stole
my necklace.

44:56.753 --> 44:58.186
But the necklace
is here, no?

45:00.357 --> 45:02.222
Well, they kidnapped me
and they tied me up.

45:02.359 --> 45:04.520
And yet,
you too are here.

45:04.661 --> 45:06.891
I see no problem,
everybody is very happy.

45:07.597 --> 45:10.225
Excuse me,
but I am not happy.

45:10.333 --> 45:11.322
Hmm.

45:11.434 --> 45:14.232
But this I can do
nothing about.

45:20.243 --> 45:21.835
So, where to?

45:23.079 --> 45:24.444
Let's go home.

45:24.548 --> 45:27.415
I don't know, Meg.
Have you really thought about this?

45:27.517 --> 45:30.213
No! No, not at all.

45:30.587 --> 45:31.918
But what did you
tell your dad?

45:32.022 --> 45:33.990
Well, I told him
I'd call and check in every day,

45:34.491 --> 45:36.254
that I won't tell him
everything I'm doing,

45:36.359 --> 45:37.792
that I'll be back
in August,

45:37.894 --> 45:39.088
and then

45:39.696 --> 45:41.288
I hung up
very quickly.

45:47.871 --> 45:48.895
You,

45:51.141 --> 45:52.768
take care of my sister.

45:53.610 --> 45:55.305
Precious cargo.

45:56.012 --> 45:58.037
My driver
will take you to the airport.

46:00.717 --> 46:02.582
Bye, you
two lovebirds.

46:07.190 --> 46:08.748
Please tell Theo
I said goodbye.

46:10.093 --> 46:11.185
I will be sure to.

46:12.729 --> 46:14.560
And that he was right.

46:15.632 --> 46:16.599
I am different.

46:17.234 --> 46:18.701
He knows that.

46:20.303 --> 46:21.634
But I'll tell him.

46:22.472 --> 46:23.769
Thank you.

46:24.107 --> 46:25.131
Bye.

46:37.520 --> 46:38.748
- <i>Au revoir!</i>
- See you later.

46:38.855 --> 46:40.152
<i>Au revoir.</i>

47:05.915 --> 47:07.109
Hi, Mom.

47:08.652 --> 47:10.415
Yeah, we had
an amazing time.

48:18.121 --> 48:19.713
Just like that.

48:19.956 --> 48:21.423
Try it out.

49:06.736 --> 49:09.762
Hey, Grace,
I need somebody to run to the post office.

49:10.373 --> 49:11.704
I'll do it.

49:25.121 --> 49:26.486
That was it.

49:26.623 --> 49:27.920
Yes, all right.

49:28.024 --> 49:30.549
Now I am going to show you
the foundation of the new stadium,

49:30.660 --> 49:34.289
which is possibly
to be ready by the end of the month.

49:43.239 --> 49:45.400
We will have new lighting
for each classroom,

49:45.508 --> 49:47.806
and the computers
will be here by September.

49:48.812 --> 49:50.279
<i>Superbe.</i> Fine.

49:53.183 --> 49:54.241
Thank you very much.

49:54.417 --> 49:55.748
So,
what do you think?

49:55.852 --> 49:56.910
Well,

49:57.554 --> 49:58.987
it's amazing.

49:59.522 --> 50:01.888
This follows
the same model as you saw it in Rajasthan.

50:01.991 --> 50:02.958
This is the dormitory?

50:03.059 --> 50:05.152
Yes, for about
100 children.

50:05.495 --> 50:07.258
And on the other side
we have the garden.

50:10.433 --> 50:12.196
Excuse me one moment.

50:12.836 --> 50:13.962
Grace!

50:15.972 --> 50:17.166
Grace!

50:40.463 --> 50:41.589
Grace!

51:03.620 --> 51:04.678
Theo.

51:06.789 --> 51:08.279
What are you
doing here?

51:09.292 --> 51:10.657
I'm working.

51:11.561 --> 51:13.085
What are you
doing here?

51:13.630 --> 51:15.393
I'm volunteering.

51:23.773 --> 51:25.400
I don't think that
we've properly met.

51:27.076 --> 51:28.703
I'm Grace Bennett.

51:30.046 --> 51:31.513
Theo Marchand.

51:32.382 --> 51:33.508
It's nice
to meet you.

51:43.793 --> 51:47.160
<i>He's got looks that books</i>
<i>take pages to tell</i>

51:47.263 --> 51:50.357
<i>He's got a face</i>
<i>to make you fall on your knees</i>

51:50.466 --> 51:53.993
<i>He's got money in the bank</i>
<i>to thank and I guess</i>

51:54.103 --> 51:56.936
<i>You could think</i>
<i>he's livin'at ease</i>

51:57.040 --> 52:00.498
<i>Like lovers on the open shore</i>
<i>What's the matter?</i>

52:00.610 --> 52:02.771
<i>When you're sitting there</i>
<i>with so much more</i>

52:02.879 --> 52:04.141
<i>What's the matter?</i>

52:04.247 --> 52:06.340
<i>While you're wondering</i>
<i>what the hell to be</i>

52:07.083 --> 52:10.052
<i>Are you wishing</i>
<i>you were ugly like me?</i>

52:10.153 --> 52:13.179
<i>Blame it on the girls</i>
<i>who know what to do</i>

52:13.289 --> 52:16.486
<i>Blame it on the boys</i>
<i>who keep hitting on you</i>

52:16.593 --> 52:19.858
<i>Blame it on your mother</i>
<i>for the things she said</i>

52:19.963 --> 52:23.091
<i>Blame it on your father</i>
<i>but you know he's dead</i>

52:23.199 --> 52:26.464
<i>Blame it on the girls</i>

52:26.569 --> 52:29.697
<i>Blame it on the boys</i>

52:29.806 --> 52:33.139
<i>Blame it on the girls</i>

52:33.242 --> 52:36.439
<i>Blame it on the boys</i>

52:36.546 --> 52:39.709
<i>Blame it on the girls</i>

52:39.816 --> 52:43.013
<i>Blame it on the boys</i>

52:43.119 --> 52:46.350
<i>Blame it on the girls</i>

52:46.456 --> 52:49.755
<i>Blame it on the boys</i>

52:49.859 --> 52:52.987
<i>Blame it on the girls</i>

52:53.096 --> 52:56.657
<i>Blame it on the boys</i>

53:01.237 --> 53:05.367
<i>Wouldn't wanna be</i>
<i>anybody else, hey</i>

53:07.810 --> 53:09.744
<i>You made me insecure</i>

53:10.179 --> 53:12.545
<i>Told me I wasn't good enough</i>

53:12.649 --> 53:14.480
<i>But who are you to judge</i>

53:14.584 --> 53:17.314
<i>When you're a diamond</i>
<i>in the rough</i>

53:17.420 --> 53:19.445
<i>I'm sure</i>
<i>you got some things</i>

53:19.555 --> 53:22.149
<i>You'd like to</i>
<i>change about yourself</i>

53:22.258 --> 53:24.192
<i>But when it comes to me</i>

53:24.293 --> 53:26.420
<i>I wouldn't wanna be</i>
<i>anybody else</i>

53:31.300 --> 53:33.598
<i>I'm no beauty queen</i>

53:33.703 --> 53:36.069
<i>I'm just beautiful me</i>

53:40.743 --> 53:43.507
<i>You've got every right</i>

53:43.613 --> 53:45.581
<i>To a beautiful life</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

53:45.682 --> 53:48.981
<i>Who says</i>
<i>Who says you're not perfect</i>

53:49.085 --> 53:51.212
<i>Who says</i>
<i>you're not worth it</i>

53:51.320 --> 53:54.983
<i>Who says</i>
<i>you're the only one that's hurting</i>

53:55.091 --> 53:58.583
<i>Trust me</i>
<i>That's the price of beauty</i>

53:58.695 --> 54:00.959
<i>Who says</i>
<i>you're not pretty</i>

54:01.064 --> 54:03.692
<i>Who says</i>
<i>you're not beautiful</i>

54:03.800 --> 54:05.392
<i>Who says?</i>

54:09.572 --> 54:11.767
<i>It's such a funny thing</i>

54:11.874 --> 54:14.342
<i>How nothing's funny</i>
<i>when it's you</i>

54:14.444 --> 54:16.742
<i>You tell them</i>
<i>what you mean</i>

54:16.846 --> 54:19.110
<i>But they keep</i>
<i>whiting out the truth</i>

54:19.215 --> 54:21.649
<i>It's like a work of art</i>

54:21.751 --> 54:23.878
<i>That never gets</i>
<i>to see the light</i>

54:23.986 --> 54:26.318
<i>Keep you</i>
<i>beneath the stars</i>

54:26.422 --> 54:28.686
<i>Won't let you</i>
<i>touch the sky</i>

54:33.096 --> 54:35.394
<i>I'm no beauty queen</i>

54:35.498 --> 54:37.693
<i>I'm just beautiful me</i>

54:42.538 --> 54:45.029
<i>You've got every right</i>

54:45.141 --> 54:47.371
<i>To a beautiful life</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

54:47.477 --> 54:50.776
<i>Who says</i>
<i>Who says you're not perfect</i>

54:50.880 --> 54:53.007
<i>Who says</i>
<i>you're not worth it</i>

54:53.116 --> 54:56.779
<i>Who says</i>
<i>you're the only one that's hurting</i>

54:56.886 --> 55:00.287
<i>Trust me</i>
<i>That's the price of beauty</i>

55:00.389 --> 55:02.789
<i>Who says</i>

55:02.892 --> 55:05.452
<i>Who says</i>

55:05.561 --> 55:06.926
<i>Who says?</i>

55:07.029 --> 55:08.519
<i>Who says you're</i>

55:08.631 --> 55:11.031
<i>Who says you're</i>

55:11.134 --> 55:13.295
<i>Who says you</i>
<i>can't be in movies</i>

55:13.402 --> 55:15.893
<i>Listen to me</i>
<i>Listen to me</i>

55:16.005 --> 55:18.132
<i>Who says you</i>
