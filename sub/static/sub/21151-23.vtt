WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:07.708
>> PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER":
WITH THE GAMER CONTROLLING THE

00:07.741 --> 00:10.044
GAME --
>> CONGRATULATIONS, ALEX!

00:10.078 --> 00:13.013
YOU'RE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.482
>> SHE WANTED TO TAKE OUT THE
MARINE.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.985
>> BECAUSE I WANT TO BACKDOOR
CODY, THE SAFEST THING TO DO IS

00:18.018 --> 00:20.721
TO USE TWO EXPENDABLE PAWNS.

00:20.754 --> 00:24.992
>> DESPITE BEING THE HOUSE'S
TARGET, KEVIN DECIDED TO PLAY

00:25.025 --> 00:26.894
>> YOU ONLY HAVE TWO OPTIONING.

00:26.927 --> 00:27.661
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

00:27.695 --> 00:28.796
>> YEAH.

00:28.829 --> 00:32.333
>> BUT HIS ALLIANCE WARNED HIM
NOT TO FRATERNIZE WITH THE

00:32.366 --> 00:33.434
ENEMY.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.269
>> YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL
WITH TALKING TO CODY.

00:35.303 --> 00:36.304
>> I TOLD YOU.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.538
IT'S OVER WITH, WITH HIM.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.108
>> I WANTED TO TAKE HIM TO THE
END OF THE GAME, BUT NOW THAT

00:40.141 --> 00:42.943
HE'S ACTING SO STRANGE, I'M
HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.813
>> AT THE TEMPTATION
COMPETITION, CODY HAD A HUGE

00:45.846 --> 00:46.847
DECISION TO MAKE.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.351
>> I COULD GO INTO THE
COOSMITITION AND TRY TO GET

00:50.384 --> 00:55.189
FIRST AND WIN SAFETY, OR I COULD
TRY TO GET LAST PLACE, BE THE

00:55.223 --> 00:57.358
SHIRD NOMINEE AND BE GUARANTEED
TO PLAY IN THE VETO.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.361
>> BUT IN THE END, HE WAS UNABLE
TO ACCOMPLISH EITHER GOAL.

01:00.394 --> 01:04.798
>> SORRY, MATT, WITH A SCORE OF
ZERO ARE YOU IN LAST PLACE AND

01:04.832 --> 01:11.539
WILL GO ON THE BLOCK AS THE
SPECIAL THIRD NOMINEE.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.908
>> ALL I HAD TO DO WAS THROW
THIS COMPETITION AND SOMEHOW,

01:14.942 --> 01:19.113
SOME WAY, GOT TO ANSWER RIGHT.

01:19.147 --> 01:22.350
>> WITH NOMINATIONS LOOMING,
ALEX NEEDED HER PAWNS.

01:22.383 --> 01:25.253
>> WE NEED SOMEBODY WE CAN TRUST
TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A BETTER

01:25.286 --> 01:26.287
CHANCE WINNING THE VETO.

01:26.320 --> 01:31.058
>> SO JASON HAD TO SADDLE UP
NEXT TO ELENA.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.092
>> WHAT?

01:32.126 --> 01:33.527
>> UP FOR NOMINATIONS.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.163
I TRUST YOU GUYS.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.330
THAT'S WHY.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.866
>> WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE
WALL, CODY DECIDED TO STIR THE

01:38.899 --> 01:40.033
POT.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.935
>> THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING
AFTER MARK FIRST AND THEN YOU.

01:41.969 --> 01:44.972
>> AND IT LEFT ELENA FEELING
PARANOID.

01:45.005 --> 01:48.108
>> IT KIND OF SUCKS BECAUSE IF
SOMETHING DOES GO WRONG, I FEEL

01:48.142 --> 01:49.710
LIKE I'M THE MOST DISPOSEAB.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.246
>> YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE NOT.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.282
REMEMBER LAST WEEK I TOLD YOU
YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE NOT.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.483
TRUST ME.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.385
>> SO NOW I'M IN THE POSITION
WHERE IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

01:57.418 --> 01:59.153
THIS WEEK, I GO HOME.

01:59.187 --> 02:03.257
>> AT THE NOMINATION CEREMONY--
>> I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, ELENA,

02:03.291 --> 02:04.458
AND YOU, JASON.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.827
>> CODY WAS LEFT WITH LITTLE
HOPE.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.930
>> I JUST PRAY THAT MY CHIP GETS
PULLED FOR THIS VETO.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.866
IF I GO OUT THE WEEK AFTER JESS,
I WILL NOT BE HAPPY.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.903
I WANTED TO MAKE THIS-- THIS
CHANCE WORTH IT.

02:15.936 --> 02:20.941
>> TONIGHT, WILL CODY GET A
CHANCE TO FIGHT FOR HIS LIFE IN

02:20.974 --> 02:22.075
THE POWER OF VETO?

02:22.109 --> 02:25.946
PLUS, WHO WILL MAKE A CRITICAL
MISTAKE AND LAND IN ALEX'S

02:25.979 --> 02:26.747
CROSSHAIRS?

02:26.780 --> 02:30.384
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

02:30.418 --> 02:35.423
>> DO NOT PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH.

02:38.626 --> 02:45.132
>> THE NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.167
>> YOU'RE STUPID.

02:47.201 --> 02:50.003
>> I NOMINATED ELENA AND JASON

02:50.037 --> 02:54.975
AS PAWNS, MATT IS ALREADY ON THE
BLOCK AS THE SPECIAL THIRD

02:55.008 --> 02:56.076
NOMINEE.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.579
THE PLAN THIS WEEK IS TO
BACKDOOR CODY, BUT FICAN'T GET

02:58.612 --> 03:00.080
HIM FOR WHATEVER REASON, GETTING
MATT OR ELENA WOULDN'T BE BAD,

03:00.113 --> 03:03.617
>> BEING PUT ON THE BLOCK THE
SECOND WEEK IN A ROW AS A PAWN

03:03.651 --> 03:04.785
IS ANNOYING.

03:04.818 --> 03:09.423
BUT EVEN THOUGH I DON'T FEEL
TOTALLY SAFECO THE PLAN IS TO

03:09.457 --> 03:11.959
BACKDOOR CODEY AND HE'S A HUGE
TARGET SO I FEEL GOOD KNOWING

03:11.992 --> 03:12.560
THAT.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.296
>> I AM IN NO-MAN'S-LAND.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.397
I'M AT THE BOTTOM.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.166
IT'S CLEAR I'M GETTING
BACKDOORED.

03:19.199 --> 03:23.504
I'D RATHER DIE ON MY FEET THAN
LIVE ON MY KNEES KNOWING THEY

03:23.537 --> 03:25.539
WILL NEVER MAKE A DEAL WITH ME.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.507
>> THE SPEECH WAS DUMB.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.675
THE SPEECH WAS DUMB.

03:27.708 --> 03:31.279
THE PLAN IS ONE OF US WEN THE
VETO AND ULTIMATELY BACKDOOR

03:31.312 --> 03:32.346
CODY.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.114
BUT I WANT TO WIN THE VETO SO I
CAN PULL MYSELF OFF.

03:34.147 --> 03:39.520
THEN I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE
QUESTIONS.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.656
>> OKAY, SO, WE BACKDOOR CODY.

03:42.690 --> 03:47.628
IF WE CAN'T GET CODY, WE TAKE
OUT MATT OR WE TAKE OUT ELENA.

03:47.661 --> 03:52.132
>> ELENA, BECAUSE SHE HAS A
BETTER SOCIAL GAME TO FLIP IT.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.602
>> NEXT WEEK, IF I'M GOING TO
WIN, WHO DO I PUT UP?

03:54.635 --> 03:55.869
>> I DON'T TRUST MATT.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.438
I DON'T TRUST RAVEN.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.540
ELENA, MARK, NO.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.774
>> OKAY.

04:00.808 --> 04:04.978
I THINK ALEX AND I ARE PRETTY
GOOD AT KEEPING OUR LITTLE SIDE

04:05.012 --> 04:08.716
ALLIANCE UNDER THE WRAPS BECAUSE
SHE HANGS OUT WITH JASON ALL THE

04:08.749 --> 04:09.783
TIME.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.752
AND I JUST HANG OUT WITH
EVERYBODY ELSE ALL THE TIME.

04:11.785 --> 04:15.323
SO, REALLY, IT DOESN'T REALLY
SEEM LIKE ALEX AND I HAVE A LOT

04:15.356 --> 04:16.924
IN COMMON.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.759
IF KEVIN DOESN'T
AROUND--

04:18.792 --> 04:20.661
>> HE HAS TO GO.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.296
HE IS STIRRING THE POT SO BAD.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.164
>> HE IS.

04:24.197 --> 04:27.000
JOSH, DO WE AGREE, WE SHOULD
DEFINITELY KEEP UNTIL THE END?

04:27.034 --> 04:27.935
>> YEAH, DUDE.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.571
HE'S HARMLESS, AND HE WON'T FLIP
AGAINST US.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.138
>> AGREED.

04:31.171 --> 04:34.074
SO ME, YOU, JOSH, JASON.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.311
LET'S THINK OF A FIFTH.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.412
CHRISTMAS, MAYBE.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.113
>> PAUL AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER AND BASICALLY

04:40.147 --> 04:41.615
EVERYTHING IS FALLING INTO
PLACE.

04:41.649 --> 04:45.052
AS SOON AS WE GET CODY OUT THE
DOOR, WE'RE GOING TO GET ELENA,

04:45.085 --> 04:45.519
MARK, RAVEN AND MATT.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.787
>> GOOD TALK.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.156
>> AND THEN WE'LL HAVE COMPLETE
AND TOTAL CONTROL OF THE HOUSE.

04:49.189 --> 04:53.961
WE'RE GOING TO STEAMROLE ALL THE
WAY TO THE END.

04:53.994 --> 04:57.598
PERFECT.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.532
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:58.566 --> 05:01.602
>> NOTHING MUCH.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.903
JUST CHILLING.

05:02.936 --> 05:07.675
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND WHEN IT GETS

05:07.708 --> 05:08.442
THIS BORING?

05:08.476 --> 05:10.911
>> THINK ABOUT YOUR KIDS, I
GUESS.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.680
>> YEAH.

05:12.713 --> 05:18.151
>> LIKE WHAT THE  AM I
DOING HERE?

05:18.185 --> 05:19.186
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

05:19.219 --> 05:24.625
>> WELL, IF YOU GET FIRST, THEN
IT'S ALL WORTH IT.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.695
>> WE'LL SEE HOW FAR IT GOES.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.864
I MISS MY FAMILY A LOT, A REAL
LOT.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.766
I THINK ABOUT THEM EVERY MINUTE
OF THE DAY.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.369
A FATHER HAS TO BE THERE FOR HIS
DAUGHTERS, ALWAYS.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.905
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY NEED ME, SO
IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.007
I HOPE I'M MAKING THEM PROUD.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.910
>> HOPEFULLY MY CHIP GETS
PULLED.

05:42.943 --> 05:46.514
>> GIVE YOU A CHANCE, ANYHOW.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.285
>> OH, I WILL.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.755
I DON'T TELL NO ONE HOW I FEEL.

05:54.788 --> 05:58.659
YOU KNOW, WHERE I GREW UP, YOU
JUST HAVE TO BE A MAN WHEN YOU

05:58.692 --> 06:03.831
WERE YOUNG RIGHT UP TO WHEN YOU
WERE A MAN AND YOU DIDN'T SHOW

06:03.864 --> 06:04.532
EMOTION.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.232
IT WOULD BE A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.901
IF I CRIED ON THAT TV, MAN.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.103
>> WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO BACK
HOME.

06:10.137 --> 06:21.582
ISN'T THAT A SHAME?

06:33.260 --> 06:34.695
>> HEY, EVERYONE!

06:34.728 --> 06:37.598
IT'S TIME TO PICK PLAYERS FOR
THE VETO COMPETITION!

06:37.631 --> 06:39.800
>> WHAT?

06:39.833 --> 06:44.938
TA-DA!

06:44.972 --> 06:48.542
>> ONLY SIX PEOPLE WILL
PARTICIPATE IN THE VETO

06:48.576 --> 06:49.810
COMPETITION.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.079
THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, THE THREE
NOMINEES, AND TWO OTHER PLAYERS

06:52.112 --> 06:53.447
SELECTED BY RANDOM DRAW.

06:53.481 --> 06:58.318
WILL THE NOMINEES PLEASE JOIN ME
UP HERE?

06:58.351 --> 07:01.522
>> SO THERE'S A HUGE GROUP IN
THE HOUSE WORKING TOGETHER.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.824
WE GOT JESS OUT LAST WEEK.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.526
BYE, BOO-BOO.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.395
AND NOW YOUR BOYFRIEND IS GOING
OUT THIS WEEK.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.331
AS LONG AS CODY DOESN'T GET
DRAWN IN THE VETO, WE'RE GOLDEN.

07:11.364 --> 07:15.836
>> I, AS HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, WILL
PULL TWO CHIPS OUT OF THE BOX TO

07:15.869 --> 07:18.906
DETERMINE THE OTHER PLAYERS
COMPETING IN THE VETO

07:18.939 --> 07:20.173
COMPETITION.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.543
IF I PULL THE CHIP OF MYSELF OR
ONE OF THE THREE NOMINEES, THAT

07:22.576 --> 07:26.514
PERSON WILL GET TO CHOOSE A
PLAYER OF THEIR CHOICE.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.617
>> I WOULDN'T MIND IF CODY IS
PICKED TO PLAY IN THE VETO

07:29.650 --> 07:32.920
COMPETITION, BECAUSE IF HE WINS,
HE'S SAFE, BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE

07:32.953 --> 07:34.622
HE'D USE THE VETO ON ME.

07:34.655 --> 07:40.393
SO I'M SAFE, TOO.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.428
MARK.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.499
>> I'M PUMPED I JUST GOT PICKED.

07:45.533 --> 07:49.236
I DON'T LIKE WHERE THE HOUSE IS
AT RIGHT NOW, SO IF I CAN WIN

07:49.269 --> 07:51.605
THIS VETO I'D LOVE TO STIR THE
POT AND KEEP NOMINATIONS THE

07:51.639 --> 07:54.441
SAME AND KEEP CODY IN THE HOUSE.

07:54.474 --> 07:58.111
>> THEY KNOW HOW HARD OF A
COMPETITOR I AM.

07:58.145 --> 08:03.450
TO SEE THEIR FACES ALL GET
CRUSHED EMOTIONALLY BECAUSE MY

08:03.483 --> 08:09.122
NAME GETS PICKED, IT WOULD JUST
BE GREAT TO SEE THAT.

08:09.156 --> 08:13.527
>> ALEX!

08:13.561 --> 08:15.328
I CHOOSE PAUL.

08:15.362 --> 08:24.104
"BIG BROTHER" WILL INFORM US

08:24.137 --> 08:26.039
WHEN THE COMPETITION IS TO
BEGIN.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.109
GOOD LUCK.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.979
>> YOU ALL RIGHT?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.213
>> YEAH.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.684
>> THE ONLY MISTAKE YOU MADE THE
WHOLE TIME, IN MY OPINION, IS

08:36.717 --> 08:41.188
YOU TOOK THEM UNDER YOUR WING.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.022
>> UH-HUH.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.423
>> THAT WAS IT.

08:43.456 --> 08:47.995
>> DON'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE I
JUST CAN'T HAVE ANYBODY

08:48.028 --> 08:53.433
PERSONALLY USE THIS AGAINST ME
IN THIS GAME, BUT I HAVE A

08:53.466 --> 08:53.801
DAUGHTER.

08:53.834 --> 08:54.301
>> COME ON!

08:54.334 --> 08:55.068
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.203
A FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.204
>> DOES JESSICA KNOW?

08:57.237 --> 08:57.938
>> YEAH.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.172
>> DO YOU SEE HER ALL THE TIME?

08:59.206 --> 09:02.275
>> I-- I GET HER DURING THE
SUMMER MONTHS.

09:02.309 --> 09:08.582
SO I HAD TO GIVE UP MY SUMMER
WITH HER TO DO THIS.

09:08.616 --> 09:09.449
>> WHAT'S HER NAME?

09:09.482 --> 09:10.150
>> PAISLEY.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.284
>> PAISLEY, COOL.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.687
SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO SEE HER DAD
ON TV.

09:13.721 --> 09:18.458
>> I'M SURE EVERYBODY SAYS THIS
ABOUT THEIR KID, BUT MY KID IS

09:18.491 --> 09:19.593
SMART, INSANELY SMART.

09:19.627 --> 09:23.063
I CAN SEE HOW TOUGH IT IS FOR
KEVIN TO BE AWAY FROM HIS

09:23.096 --> 09:28.101
FAMILY, SO I JUST WANTED TO LET
HIM KNOW HE'S NOT ALONE IN THIS

09:28.135 --> 09:29.236
SITUATION.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.604
IF ONE OF THEM WERE TO USE THAT
AGAINST ME, I WOULD HAVE

09:30.638 --> 09:31.872
SNAPPED, AND THEY WOULD HAVE.

09:31.905 --> 09:35.542
>> I ONLY SHARE THIS INFORMATION
WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE

09:35.575 --> 09:36.844
I FEEL I CAN TRUST.

09:36.877 --> 09:37.778
KEVIN IS ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.247
>> WELL, MARINE IT'S NICE TO
KNOW THAT, MAN.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.815
WELL, HAVE A GOOD TIME.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.751
WHATEVER'S LEFT, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING, MAN.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.517
YOU'LL DO FINE.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.186
YOU'LL BE A GOOD DAD.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.221
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.823
THERE'S NO BOOK FOR IT.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.759
IT COMES TO YOU.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.661
INTRODUCED YOU TO JESSICA.

09:53.694 --> 09:54.728
YOU'LL BE FINE.

09:54.762 --> 09:58.131
>> COMING INTO THIS, I
JUSTMENTED TO SHOW MY DAUGHTER

09:58.165 --> 10:02.369
HOW TO COMPETE WITH HEART AND
PASSION, AND TO HAVE THE HOUSE

10:02.402 --> 10:06.506
STRIP MY ABILITY TO COMPETE AWAY
FROM ME, IT'S FRUSTRATING.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.541
I JUST HAVE TO HOPE FOR A
MIRACLE.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.831
>> OH, YEAH!

10:30.864 --> 10:34.835
>> YEAH!

20:48.180 --> 20:49.482
TO WIN THE COMPETITION.

20:49.516 --> 20:52.985
>> THIS COMPETITION IS GETTING
SOLD OUT FAST.

20:53.019 --> 20:59.292
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PLACES LEFT
ON THE BOARD TO AIM FOR.

20:59.326 --> 20:59.659
OH!

20:59.692 --> 21:00.860

ELIMINATED.

21:06.933 --> 21:13.673
PLEASE CLAIM YOUR PRIZE.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.175
>> THIS COULDN'T HAVE WORKED OUT
BETTER!

21:16.208 --> 21:20.547
I JUST WON $5,000, AND ELENA
SHOULD TAKE THE VETO, AND WE'LL

21:20.580 --> 21:23.249
BE ABLE TO PUT CODY UP ON THE
BLOCK.

21:23.282 --> 21:27.520
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO KEEP YOUR
5K, OR TRADE IT FOR ONE OF THE

21:27.554 --> 21:27.954
OTHER PRIZES.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.789
>> KEEP IT!

21:29.822 --> 21:30.757
KEEP IT!

21:30.790 --> 21:38.097
>> ELENA, PLEASE CLAIM YOUR
FIRST-PLACE PRIZE.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.733
>> CAMP GUIDE.

21:40.767 --> 21:41.968
>> CONGRATULATIONS!

21:42.001 --> 21:45.672
FOR THE NEXT WEEK, IT'S YOUR JOB
TO CARRY CAMPING EQUIPMENT AT

21:45.705 --> 21:49.442
ALL TIMES, AND WHENEVER THE HORN
SOUNDS, BUILD YOUR CAMPSITE AND

21:49.476 --> 21:51.744
COOK ONE HOT DOG FOR EVERYONE IN
THE HOUSE.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.113
>> THAT'S SO FUNNY!

21:54.146 --> 21:58.751
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO KEEP YOUR
CAMP GUIDE PRIZE OR TRADE IT FOR

21:58.785 --> 21:59.586
ONE OF THE OTHER PRIZES.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.621
>> I MIGHT TAKE IT!

22:01.654 --> 22:02.789
>> WE PROMISED.

22:02.822 --> 22:03.556
WE PROMISED.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.325
WE PROMISED YOU WOULDN'T CURSE
ME.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.093
WE PROMISED.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.661
>> WOULD DO YOU IT TO ME,
THOUGH.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.363
>> NO, I WOULDN'T!

22:10.397 --> 22:11.297
>> ALEX!

22:11.330 --> 22:15.968
>> OH, MY GOD!

22:16.002 --> 22:21.107
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN, ELENA LOOKS
OVER AT ME, AS IF TO SEEK MY

22:21.140 --> 22:23.576
ADVICE ON WHAT TO DO.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.445
CLEARLY, I DON'T WANT ELENA TO
GET THE POWER OF VETO BECAUSE

22:25.478 --> 22:27.680
THEN SHE'S JUST GOING TO USE IT
ON HERSELF, AND THEN I'M GOING

22:27.714 --> 22:29.015
TO GO ON THE BLOCK.

22:29.048 --> 22:35.154
SO WHAT DO I DO?

22:35.187 --> 22:37.757
I TELL HER TO TAKE THE MONEY
FROM ALENGS.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.325
>> DIEWRKD IT'S AN EASY CHOICE.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.927
>> I'M GONNA GET CURSED.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.029
>> I'M REALLY SORRY, ALEX.

22:43.062 --> 22:53.305
I REALLY WANT THE $5,000.

22:53.339 --> 22:54.441
>> BRUTAL!

22:54.474 --> 22:55.542
THIS IS BRUTAL!

22:55.575 --> 22:56.776
THIS IS RUTHLESS.

22:56.809 --> 23:00.012
>> I REALLY WANT THE MONEY MORE
THAN I THINK I NEED THE VETO.

23:00.046 --> 23:05.918
SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND
ROLL THE DICE, AND PRAY THE PLAN

23:05.952 --> 23:07.854
TO BACKDOOR CODY HAPPENS.

23:07.887 --> 23:11.791
>> ELENA, YOU'RE THE BIGGEST,
SLIMIEST SCUMBAG IN THE ENTIRE

23:11.824 --> 23:14.827
WORLD, AND I WANT NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU.

23:14.861 --> 23:18.898
>> THE FINAL RESULTS, PAUL WITH
THE TANDEM SKY DIVING.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.067
WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TOO LONG SKY
DIVING WITH?

23:21.100 --> 23:23.603
>> WHO ELSE BUT CHRISTMAS JOY!

23:23.636 --> 23:24.771
>> IT WAS ALL FAKE!

23:24.804 --> 23:27.507
>> MARK, YOU GET THE ADVENTURE
VACATION.

23:27.540 --> 23:32.712
JASON, YOU'LL BE LIVING EXTREME
WITH YOUR EXTREME-A-TARD.

23:32.745 --> 23:36.015
ALEX, YOU'LL THE CAMP GUIDE ALL
WEEK.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.216
ELENA GETS $5,000.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.417
>> YAY, ME!

23:38.451 --> 23:41.220
>> AND CONGRATULATIONS, MATT,
YOU'RE THE BIG WINNER WITH THE

23:41.253 --> 23:42.822
VETO AND THE OUTBACK DINNER.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.457
>> YAY!

23:44.491 --> 23:48.127
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, THIS WAS NOT
THE PLAN, BUT THE VETO JUST FELL

23:48.160 --> 23:49.562
INTO MY LAP THIS WEEK.

23:49.596 --> 23:52.832
BUT, HEY, THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR NEFERG THIS GAME, AND I FEEL

23:52.865 --> 23:56.168
PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.670
>> MATT WINS THE VETO.

23:57.704 --> 24:01.574
A LITTLE BIZARRE AND NOT THE
BEST-CASE SCENARIO, IF MATT

24:01.608 --> 24:04.010
PULLS HIMSELF OFF, THERE'S NO
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE, AND THAT

24:04.043 --> 24:06.746
MEANS CODY ISN'T ON THE BLOCK,
AND SOMEBODY ELSE HAS TO GO

24:06.779 --> 24:08.014
HOME.

24:08.047 --> 24:11.383
>> I SAID I NEED A MIRACLE, AND
SOMEHOW, SOME WAY, MATT WINS THE

24:11.417 --> 24:15.321
POWER OF VETO, ELENA PISSES OFF
THE H.O.H., I MIGHT ACTUALLY BE

24:15.354 --> 24:19.859
ABLE TO USE THIS SITUATION TO MY
ADVANTAGE THIS WEEK.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.060
>> HUG!

24:21.093 --> 24:25.632
>> I DON'T REGRET TAKING THE
$5,000, BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT

24:25.665 --> 24:30.570
TAKE THE $5,000 MAKES THE TARGET
THAT WAS ALREADY ON MY BACK A

24:30.603 --> 24:32.672
LITTLE BIT BIGGER.

24:32.705 --> 24:33.940
I'M SO SORRY, ALEX.

24:33.973 --> 24:34.641
I LOVE YOU.

24:34.674 --> 24:35.775
I'M SO SORRY.

24:35.808 --> 24:39.245
>> BECAUSE I'M THE QUEEN OF
PETTY, I WANT TO MAKE ELENA

24:39.278 --> 24:40.680
SWEAT AND BE UNCOMFORTABLE.

24:40.713 --> 24:43.449
DON'T MAKE PROMISES YOU CAN'T
KEEP, EELENA BECAUSE YOU KNOW

24:43.482 --> 24:44.551
WHAT?

24:44.584 --> 24:45.685
I'M COMING FOR YOU AND I'M GOING
TO MAKE SURE GO HOME.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.448
>> ELENA LITERALLY DOESN'T KNOW
HOW STUPID SHE WAS BY TAKING

25:16.482 --> 25:17.483
THAT MONEY.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.652
IN THIS GAME, YOUR WORD IS
LITERALLY ALL YOU HAVE.

25:19.686 --> 25:20.887
SO IF NOBODY BELIEVES YOU,
YOU'RE GOING HOME.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.522
AND SHE LITERALLY SHOT HERSELF
IN THE FACE WHEN SHE DID THAT IN

25:23.556 --> 25:24.490
FRONT OF EVERYONE.

25:24.523 --> 25:24.924
JOSH?

25:24.957 --> 25:26.959
WANT TO COME IN?

25:26.993 --> 25:30.529
>> YEAH.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.331
>> SEND THAT BITCH HOME.

25:32.364 --> 25:37.003
SHE MADE ME PROMISE I WOULDN'T
CURSE HER IF I WIN.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.137
SEND HER HOME!

25:38.170 --> 25:40.640
>> SHE'S A GREEDY, SELFISH
PLAYER, AND SHE'S GOING TO DO

25:40.673 --> 25:41.908
WHATEVER IT TAKES FOR HER.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.944
>> I WANT TO TAKE JASON OFF THE
BLOCK BECAUSE IT'S TOO RISKY TO

25:44.977 --> 25:47.446
LEAVE HIM UP THERE ON EVICTION
NIGHT.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.081
SHE PROMISED ME SHE WOULDN'T
CURSE ME.

25:49.115 --> 25:52.952
EVEN THOUGH CODY WILL BE
REPLACING JASON, HE MIGHT NOT BE

25:52.985 --> 25:54.020
MY TARGET.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.824
I WAS GOING TO HOLD UP MY
BARGAIN AND NOT CURSE HER.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.892
SHE WAS LIKE, "WOULD YOU REALLY
NOT HAVE IN?

25:59.926 --> 26:08.935
AND I SAID, "YES, MY WORD IS MY
WORD IN THIS GAME."

26:08.968 --> 26:09.501
>> HI.

26:09.535 --> 26:12.204
>> SO YOU'RE CRAZY.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.806
>> SHOULD I NOT HAVE DONE THAT?

26:13.840 --> 26:17.109
>> I THINK IT'S GREAT.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.111
>> $5,000?

26:19.145 --> 26:20.613
>> SO HERE'S THE THING.

26:20.647 --> 26:23.750
YOU'RE THE FIRST-- YOU HAVE TO
TAKE WHAT YOU CAN GET WHEN YOU

26:23.783 --> 26:27.186
CAN GET IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN?

26:27.219 --> 26:30.022
THIRD THROUGH 11th MEANS
NOTHING, SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE

26:30.056 --> 26:30.556
FIVE GRAND.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.323
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.192
I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
THING--

26:33.225 --> 26:37.930
>> IS 5 GRAND GOING TO MAKE ME
EVEN MORE OF A TARGET THAN I

26:37.964 --> 26:38.230
ALREADY AM?

26:38.264 --> 26:39.231
>> YES.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.133
>> BUT YOU'RE ALREADY--
>> I'M ALREADY A TARGET.

26:41.167 --> 26:41.934
I'M ALREADY AT THE BOTTOM.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.903
>> I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
THING.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.072
I REALLY WANT ELENA TO FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THIS.

26:46.105 --> 26:51.243
BECAUSE IF ELENA DOESN'T
APOLOGIZE TO ALEX, MAYBE ELENA

26:51.277 --> 26:53.680
BECOMES PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE
IN THE HOUSE, AND ALEX MIGHT NOT

26:53.713 --> 26:54.914
PUT ME UP.

26:54.947 --> 26:58.250
>> WOULD ALEX HAVE TAKEN IT?

26:58.284 --> 26:58.685
YEAH.

26:58.718 --> 26:59.786
SHE WOULD HAVE.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.554
>> EVERY TIME THEY DO SOMETHING,
IT'S ALWAYS JUSTIFIED.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.356
EVERY TIME YOU DO SOMETHING,
IT'S WRONG.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.257
>> YUP.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.326
>> THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO HAVE
YOUR BACK.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.996
YOU NEED TO TAKE WHAT YOU CAN
GET WHEN YOU CAN GET IT, AND

27:10.029 --> 27:12.498
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

27:12.531 --> 27:15.501
>> YEAH IT'S A... SITUATION.

27:15.534 --> 27:16.669
LIKE PERPETUAL PAWN.

27:16.703 --> 27:17.403
>> EXACTLY.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.205
THAT'S ALL ARE YOU TO THEM.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.439
THAT'S IT.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.609
ELENA'S BIG MESS-UP MIGHT BE MY
SAVING GRACE IN THIS GAME.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.110
I LOVE IT.

27:24.143 --> 27:24.811
>> THANK YOU.

27:24.844 --> 27:25.745
>> CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WIN.

27:25.778 --> 27:26.478
I LOVE IT!

27:26.512 --> 27:32.919
>> THANKS, CODY.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.020
>> WHERE'S THE REMOTE?

27:34.053 --> 27:35.221
>> I THINK IT'S ON THE BED.

27:35.254 --> 27:42.695
>> CAN YOU SWITCH IT TO DINING?

27:42.729 --> 27:45.965
>> SHOULD I ASK IF CODY WANTS TO
HANG OUT?

27:45.998 --> 27:47.199
>> CALL HIM.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.737
>> I NOTICE CODY IN THE KITCHEN
AND GIVE HIM A HOLLER AND ASK

27:50.770 --> 27:52.138
HIM TO COME UP TO THE PARTY.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.539
YOU WANT TO HANG OUT.

27:53.572 --> 27:59.611
EVERYBODY IS INVITED EXCEPT
ELENA, AND I KNOW THAT HAS TO

27:59.645 --> 28:00.947
MAKE HER EXTREMELY PARANOID.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.314
>> THERE HE IS!

28:02.348 --> 28:07.519
>> WHAT KIND OF HOT DOGS DOES
EVERYONE WANT?

28:07.553 --> 28:08.087
>> STANDARD BEEF.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.055
>> STANDARD BEEF.

28:09.088 --> 28:12.258
>> I DON'T ENJOY THE COMPANY OF
THESE PEOPLE.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.392
ALL.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.896
I ACTUALLY-- IT KILLS ME A
LITTLE BIT INSIDE EACH TIME I

28:16.929 --> 28:18.765
HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF
THEM.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.432
>> YOU WOULD HAVE KILLED IT ON
THE WALL.

28:20.466 --> 28:23.335
>> I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE
DONE THAT.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.570
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THE WALL?

28:24.603 --> 28:26.906
>> BECAUSE I WAS OUT THE GAME.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.175
>> HE WAS IN BUY-BACK.

28:29.208 --> 28:34.847
>> BUT I GUESS IF IT GETS ME ONE
STEP CLOSER TO $500,000, I'LL DO

28:34.881 --> 28:36.883
IT.

28:48.727 --> 28:53.099
* *
>> JASON, PLEASE GO TO THE DIARY

28:53.132 --> 28:54.433
ROOM.

28:54.466 --> 29:00.206
>> MAN, I HOPE IT'S NOT SOME
STUPID LEOTARD.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.809
I'LL LOOK LIKE SOME DUMB ASS.

29:02.842 --> 29:06.979
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WIN THE VETO,
NOW I HAVE TO WIN AN

29:07.013 --> 29:08.380
EXTREME-A-TARD THE WHOLE WEEK.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.951
I THINK THIS IS A NIGHTMARE THAT
HAS COME TRUE.

29:11.984 --> 29:12.819
HEY, EVERYBODY!

29:12.852 --> 29:17.623
WHO WANTS TO SEE MY
EXTREME

29:17.656 --> 29:19.191
>> LET ME SEE!

29:19.225 --> 29:21.727
>> OH, MY GOD!

29:21.760 --> 29:23.195
>> WHOA!

29:23.229 --> 29:24.363
NOW THAT'S EXTREME!

29:24.396 --> 29:26.365
>> I'M SO EXTREME!

29:26.398 --> 29:32.604
I HAVE AN EXTREME VOICE THAT I
HAVE TO EXTREMELY REACT TO.

29:32.638 --> 29:35.574
>> JASON IS BRUSHING HIS TEETH.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.244
THAT'S SOME EXTREME CAVITY
FIGHTING.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.079
>> THAT'S BECAUSE I'M SO
EXTREME!

29:40.112 --> 29:42.214
AND IT IS EXTREMELY AGGRAVATING.

29:42.248 --> 29:45.217
>> JASON IS DOING SOME EXTREME
LOUNGING!

29:45.251 --> 29:49.555
>> I'M SO EXTREME!

29:49.588 --> 29:52.791
>> JASON IS GOING TO THE
BATHROOM.

29:52.825 --> 29:55.061
THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET EXTREME!

29:55.094 --> 29:57.096
>> THAT'S HORRIBLE!

29:57.129 --> 29:59.365
>> AAARRRHH!

29:59.398 --> 30:08.107
>> JASON IS DOING SOME EXTREME
DREAMING!

30:08.140 --> 30:10.309
>> EXTREME DREAMING, YEAH!

30:10.342 --> 30:12.578
I'M DOING SOME EXTREME DREAMING!

30:12.611 --> 30:15.181
I FEEL LIKE A DUD.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.216
AND I'M DIZZY.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.154
>> OKAY, WAIT.

30:22.188 --> 30:30.796
>> WHO WANTS TO GO TANDEM SKY
DIVING!

30:30.829 --> 30:31.797
LET'S GO!

30:31.830 --> 30:33.199
>> OH, MY GOD!

30:33.232 --> 30:35.567
THIS IS SO CUTE!

30:35.601 --> 30:36.635
>> IS THAT ALL WEEK?

30:36.668 --> 30:37.436
>> TWO DAYS.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.605
>> WE'RE STUCK TOGETHER FOR 48
HOURS.

30:39.638 --> 30:42.508
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I HAVE TO
POOP NOW.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.610
>> WE SHOULD PUT SNACKS IN HERE.

30:44.643 --> 30:46.078
>> WE HAVE COFFEE TOGETHER.

30:46.112 --> 30:47.346
WE SLEEP TOGETHER.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.848
>> WE GET ULTIMATE FRIENDSHIP.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.318
>> WE SCOOT AROUND--
>> WE SCOOT AROUND TOGETHER.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.752
>> SHORT STRIDES.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.022
SHORT STEPS.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.490
I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL CHRISTMAS
LEG.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.191
PULL HARDER.

30:59.225 --> 31:01.593
NOW I HAVE MY VERY OWN REINDEER.

31:01.627 --> 31:05.131
>> I'M LIKE ARE YOU DOLPH, ONLY
HAIRER.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.098
>> SO HAIRY.

31:06.132 --> 31:08.968
>> MUSH!

31:09.001 --> 31:09.601
MUSH!

31:09.635 --> 31:10.569
>> PAUL, YOU LOOK MISERABLE.

31:10.602 --> 31:16.142
>> OH, MY--
>> FOR MY PUNISHMENT, I HAVE TO

31:16.175 --> 31:18.377
DRESS AS A CAMP GUIDE FOR THE
WHOLE WEEK.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.912
>> IS IT HEAVY?

31:19.946 --> 31:20.546
>> YEAH.

31:20.579 --> 31:21.113
THIS IS IT.

31:21.147 --> 31:23.315
THIS IS ME FOR A WEEK.

31:23.349 --> 31:30.189
ANY EVERY TIME I HEAR THE BUGLE,

31:30.222 --> 31:33.559
LITERALLY I HAVE TO SET UP A
WHOLE ENTIRE CAMPSITE, ACCORDING

31:33.592 --> 31:37.229
TO THE DIAGRAM-- WHO WANTS A HOT
DOG?

31:37.263 --> 31:38.297
COOK 11 HOT DOGS.

31:38.330 --> 31:39.631
>> THAT'S HERS.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.700
>> THAT'S ELENA'S.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.737
>> AND PERSONALLY DELIVER ALL
THE HOT DOGS TO EVERY

31:45.771 --> 31:46.205
HOUSEGUEST.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.639
KEVIN, A HOT DOG.

31:47.673 --> 31:48.674
YOU GET A WEINER.

31:48.707 --> 31:49.508
>> IS THIS COOKED?

31:49.541 --> 31:52.211
>> YOU GET A WEANER!

31:52.244 --> 31:53.012
EVERYBODY GETS WEANERS.

31:53.045 --> 31:55.147
>> ALEX, THANK YOU.

31:55.181 --> 31:55.982
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.250
>> ARE YOU GOING TO PUT
CONDIMENTS ON.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.752
>> AND THEN I HAVE TO PACK
EVERYTHING BACK INSIDE.

32:00.786 --> 32:03.322
THE SECOND I'M DONE, THEY'RE
GOING TO DO AGAIN.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.624
IT'S KIND OF A LONG PROCESS.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.859
I WILL BE GOING TO THE STORAGE
ROOM.

32:07.893 --> 32:12.064
>> OH!

32:12.098 --> 32:14.533
.

32:14.566 --> 32:18.237
>> EVERY TIME I HEAR THIS BUG
EXPEL EVERY TIME I PUT ON THIS

32:18.270 --> 32:22.174
HEAVY BACKPACK, IT JUST MAKES ME
WANT TO TAKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

32:22.208 --> 32:27.546
THOSE HOT DOGS AND SLAP ELENA
AROUND WITH IT.

32:27.579 --> 32:28.981
I'M SO SUPER SALTY.

32:29.015 --> 32:34.920
ALL THIS WEIGHT ON ME BASICALLY

32:34.953 --> 32:36.855
FEELS LIKE I'M CARRYING ANOTHER
ME ON MYSELF.

32:36.888 --> 32:40.459
AND I HATE GOING DOWN THE STAIRS
BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE, THE STAIRWAY

32:40.492 --> 32:41.427
TO HELL.

32:41.460 --> 32:45.097
IF I MAKE ONE FALSE MOVE, I WILL
LITERALLY DIE.

32:45.131 --> 32:55.174
* *
>> HOLD ON.

32:55.174 --> 33:06.785
* *
>> HOLD ON.

33:06.818 --> 33:07.986
>> OBVIOUSLY.

33:08.020 --> 33:11.357
>> EVERY TIME I HEAR THAT BUGLE
SOUND, IT'S LIKE THE HEAVENS

33:11.390 --> 33:15.861
OPEN UP, AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE HOPE THAT ALEX WILL TARGET

33:15.894 --> 33:21.900
ELENA THIS WEEK AND NOT ME.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.001
>> YOU'RE NOT MY TARGET.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.070
YOU KNOW THAT, TOO.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.705
>> BUT LET ME HELP YOU OUT IN
THIS GAME.

33:26.738 --> 33:31.277
>> TALKING TO CODY KIND OF MAKES
ME FEEL TEMPTED TO GO ALONG WITH

33:31.310 --> 33:33.612
THIS PLAN AND GET REVENGE ON
ELENA.

33:33.645 --> 33:37.749
I REALLY WANT TO GO ROGUE AND
SEND HER HOME AND SEE THE STUPID

33:37.783 --> 33:41.453
LOOK ON HER FACE THAT SHE JUST
LET GO OF $500,000 FOR $5,000.

33:41.487 --> 33:44.423
>> IF I'M UP THERE, I'M OUT,
THAT'S IT.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.091
CONSIDER IT.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.159
JUST CONSIDER IT.

33:47.193 --> 33:51.330
THANKS.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.808
* *
>> HEY, EVERYBODY!

34:02.841 --> 34:05.877
IT'S TIME FOR THE OUTBACK
STEAKHOUSE REWARD.

34:05.911 --> 34:09.281
>> YAY!

34:09.315 --> 34:13.619
>> THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE
HEARD YOU YELL, MATT.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.054
>> WON'T BE THE LAST?

34:16.088 --> 34:17.289
>> PROMISE?

34:17.323 --> 34:19.024
>> YES, MAM.

34:19.057 --> 34:23.362
AS WINNER OF THIS WEEK'S VETO, I
GET TO INVITE FIVE GUESTS OF MY

34:23.395 --> 34:27.166
CHOOSE TO ENJOY A PRIVATE DINNER
IN THE BACKYARD WHERE OUTBACK

34:27.199 --> 34:31.503
STEAKHOUSE WILL TREAT US TO AN
AMAZING USEY RULES FEAST!

34:31.537 --> 34:35.907
WE'LL START WITH LODED BLOOMING

34:35.941 --> 34:39.578
ONIONS AND THEN VICTORIA'S
FILET, LOBSTER TAIL, AND A SALAD

34:39.611 --> 34:43.349
AND BAKED POTATO WITH ALL THE
FICKINS.

34:43.382 --> 34:48.287
AND WE'LL TOP IT ALL OFF WITH A
CHOCOLATE THUNDER FROM DOWN

34:48.320 --> 34:49.288
UNDER DESSERT.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.590
I CAN INVITE ANYONE I WANT
INCLUDING HAVE-NOTES.

34:51.623 --> 34:58.730
I AM GOING TO INVITE MARK,
ELENA, PAUL, AND ALEX AND JASON.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.899
I DECIDE THAT I'LL TAKE
EVERYBODY THAT PARTICIPATED WITH

35:00.932 --> 35:02.534
ME IN THE VETO COMPETITION.

35:02.568 --> 35:06.205
>> IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU, I WANT
TO FORFEIT MY SPOT BECAUSE

35:06.238 --> 35:12.010
YOU'VE BEEN SUCH A GOOD SPORT IN
BEING MY TANDEM PARTNER.

35:12.043 --> 35:13.379
>> SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

35:13.412 --> 35:14.380
>> OH!

35:14.413 --> 35:21.353
>> YAY!

35:21.387 --> 35:25.090
>> OH, YEAH!

35:25.123 --> 35:26.858
>> EXTREME!

35:26.892 --> 35:30.196
>> OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE,
OUTSTANDING.

35:30.229 --> 35:34.166
I'M A BOVINE SPECIALIST, AND
THEY KNOW HOW I LIKE THEM--

35:34.200 --> 35:35.567
EXTREMELY JUICY!

35:35.601 --> 35:36.735
>> CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYBODY.

35:36.768 --> 35:37.369
THIS IS AWESOME.

35:37.403 --> 35:39.705
>> THIS IS AWESOME.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.173
>> EXTREME BEER.

35:41.207 --> 35:44.276
>> THANK YOU!

35:44.310 --> 35:47.179
>> HERE WE GO!

35:47.213 --> 35:47.546
.

35:47.579 --> 35:48.113
>> EXTREME!

35:48.146 --> 35:49.515
>> OH, THAT IS AWESOME.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.283
>> HUBBA, HUBBA.

35:51.317 --> 35:54.019
>> ARE THERE FRENCH FRIES ON
TOP!

35:54.052 --> 35:55.554
>> THIS IS SO GOOD.

35:55.587 --> 35:58.524
>> IT'S BEEN WHAT, 50-PLUS DAYS
BTWO MONTHS?

35:58.557 --> 36:01.393
>> I FORGOT THESE THINGS WERE SO
BIG.

36:01.427 --> 36:04.530
>> YOU GET SO CAUGHT UP IN THIS
HOUSE AND THE GAME AND THE HALF

36:04.563 --> 36:05.096
MILLION DOLLARS.

36:05.130 --> 36:06.532
>> HERE'S TO FRIENDSHIP.

36:06.565 --> 36:10.101
>> SO IT'S JUST NICE TO STEP OUT
FOR A NIGHT AND RELAX AND ENJOY

36:10.135 --> 36:11.570
EACH OTHER'S COMPANY.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.672
>> IT'S EXTREME!

36:13.705 --> 36:16.308
>> IT'S EXTREME!

36:16.342 --> 36:20.812
>> I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE A HOT
DOG WHEN SHE COMES IN.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.481
>> YAY!

36:22.514 --> 36:25.784
>> I LOVE THEIR SALADS.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.018
>> DO WE HAVE ROOM?

36:27.052 --> 36:28.520
>> OH, WE HAVE ROOM.

36:28.554 --> 36:30.556
>> HOLY COW!

36:30.589 --> 36:32.358
>> THANK YOU!

36:32.391 --> 36:33.792
>> EVERYBODY HAS THEIR PLATE.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.761
>> READY TO ROLL!

36:35.794 --> 36:36.928
>> LET'S DO THIS!

36:36.962 --> 36:38.364
>> YES!

36:38.397 --> 36:41.132
>> IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY NICE TO
HAVE A PAUSE ON THE "BIG

36:41.166 --> 36:41.533
BROTHER" GAME.

36:41.567 --> 36:42.701
>> OH, MY GOD!

36:42.734 --> 36:43.902
>> THANK YOU, OUTBACK!

36:43.935 --> 36:45.070
>> THANK YOU!

36:45.103 --> 36:47.873
>> AND JUST ENJOY A NICE MEAL
WITH MY FELLOW HOUSEGUESTS.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.708
>> OH, MY GOSH.

36:49.741 --> 36:55.180
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.483
>> I GOT IT ALL OVER MY HANDS.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.217
>> THEY'VE BEEN SCREAMING THE
WHOLE TIME.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.953
>> EVERY TIME THEY GET A NEW
ENTREE.

37:01.987 --> 37:04.055
>> THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF
ENTREES, THEN.

37:04.089 --> 37:10.195
>> WOOO!

37:10.228 --> 37:12.731
>> OH, MY GOD, I'M SO FULL!

37:12.764 --> 37:14.165
I'M SO HAPPY.

37:14.199 --> 37:15.967
>> ELENA!

37:16.001 --> 37:17.869
>> WITH HER HANDS.

37:17.903 --> 37:22.941
>> THAT CHOCOLATE, THOUGH.

37:25.277 --> 37:28.847
>> AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS
GAME, I HAD HAD RESPECT FOR

37:28.880 --> 37:29.481
ALEX.

37:29.515 --> 37:30.516
I WANTED TO WORK WITH ALEX.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.917
NOW SHE'S IN CONTROL OF MY FATE.

37:31.950 --> 37:36.788
BECAUSE ELENA TOOK AWAY ALEX'S
$5,000, AND FORCED HER INTO MAKE

37:36.822 --> 37:40.225
HOT DOGS, THIS IS A PERFECT TIME
TO TALK TO ALEX ABOUT NOT MAKING

37:40.258 --> 37:44.796
ME THE TARGET THIS WEEK.

37:44.830 --> 37:48.334
>> SHE PULLS YOU OFF, AND I GO
UP, I'M GOING HOME THIS WEEK.

37:48.367 --> 37:51.002
>> EVERYBODY'S TERRIFIED OF YOU.

37:51.036 --> 37:53.204
EVERYBODY WANTS YOU GONE.

37:53.238 --> 37:56.342
>> JASON, I WANT YOU TO JUST
THINK BOOK TO WHEN YOU WERE IN

37:56.375 --> 37:56.675
THIS POSITION.

37:56.708 --> 37:57.576
>> I KNOW.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.445
>> AND YOU ASKED ME TO SAVE YOU
AND I DID.

37:59.478 --> 38:02.514
I JUST WANT YOU TO JUST--
>> I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT

38:02.548 --> 38:03.214
IT.

38:03.248 --> 38:04.383
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.

38:04.416 --> 38:10.922
>> ALEX, YOU AND JESS HAD
PERSONALLY WHATEVER AGAINST YOU,

38:10.956 --> 38:12.658
THAT WEEK, I WAS LIKE, THERE'S
NO WAY.

38:12.691 --> 38:15.427
I WAS LIKE, YOU'RE NOT TAKING ON
ALEX.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.863
IF I GO UP, I'M GOING HOME.

38:17.896 --> 38:20.165
YOU HAVE A JUSTIFICATION FOR
GOING AFTER ELENA NOW.

38:20.198 --> 38:21.533
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

38:21.567 --> 38:26.772
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE YOU COULD
PUT UP?

38:26.805 --> 38:31.410
I WANT YOU GUYS TO REALIZE, I
DON'T THINK YOU GUYS ARE EVER

38:31.443 --> 38:32.611
SAFE.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.580
YOU GUYS ARE THE TWO STRONGEST
PEOPLE IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW.

38:34.613 --> 38:38.283
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
ALTERNATE H.O.H.s ALL THE WAY

38:38.316 --> 38:39.385
TO THE END.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.553
AT LEAST IF YOU KEEP ME, I'M
STILL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE

38:41.587 --> 38:44.022
BARREL, AND THEY'RE GOING TO GO
AFTER ME.

38:44.055 --> 38:47.459
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO GO TO
THE JURY HOUSE AND YOU GUYS ARE

38:47.493 --> 38:53.131
GOING TO THINK YOU DID A GOOD
SAFE MOVE, AND THE NEXT WEEK ONE

38:53.164 --> 38:55.367
OF YOU WILL COME THROUGH THE
DOOR.

38:55.401 --> 38:57.769
>> IF THAMS, I WILL FEEL LIKE
THE BIGGEST... WHATEVER.

38:57.803 --> 39:01.740
>> THE WORST CASE, I GO HOME,
AND THEY GO, "LET'S TAKE A SHOT

39:01.773 --> 39:04.476
AT JASON OR ALEX THIS WEEK.

39:04.510 --> 39:07.479
>> THIS SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING I
ACTUALLY MIGHT CONSIDER, BECAUSE

39:07.513 --> 39:09.948
RIGHT NOW I DON'T LIKE ELENA,
AND THIS IS THE PERFECT

39:09.981 --> 39:13.284
OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE HER OUT AND
MAYBE GET CODY AS A STRONG ALLY.

39:13.318 --> 39:16.622
I JUST NEED TO DECIDE WHAT THE
BEST LONG-TERM MOVE WOULD BE.

39:16.655 --> 39:21.893
>> IT WOULD DRAW A LINE IN THE
SAND, BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO TO,

39:21.927 --> 39:22.894
I AM...

39:22.928 --> 39:24.930
I'M THERE.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.873
>> YUP, 100%.

39:34.906 --> 39:38.109
>> NOW THAT WE HAVE CODY WHERE
WE WANT HIM, THE ONLY THING THAT

39:38.143 --> 39:42.147
COULD SCREW THIS UP IS IF MATT
USING THE VETO, SAVES HIMSELF,

39:42.180 --> 39:43.248
AND SCREWS UP THE PLAN.

39:43.281 --> 39:44.583
>> CODY GOING UP?

39:44.616 --> 39:48.153
>> YUP.

39:48.186 --> 39:51.723
>> HISTORICALLY, IT'S PRETTY
RARE FOR THE VETO HOLDER NOT TO

39:51.757 --> 39:54.726
USE THE VETO ON THEMSELVES WHEN
THEY'RE ON THE BLOCK, SO THE

39:54.760 --> 39:58.029
LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS GET
OVER-CONFIDENT AND MAKE A MOVE

39:58.063 --> 39:59.898
THAT COULD COST ME MY LIFE IN
THIS GAME.

39:59.931 --> 40:02.200
SO I REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT
THIS DECISION.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.301
ALL RIGHT.

40:03.334 --> 40:09.708
THANK YOU.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.545
>> HEY, EVERYBODY.

40:13.579 --> 40:22.954
IT'S TIME FOR THE VETO MEETING.

40:22.988 --> 40:25.123
THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.

40:25.156 --> 40:28.126
ALEX HAS NOMINATED JASON AND
ELENA FOR EVICTION.

40:28.159 --> 40:32.163
AND BECAUSE I CAME IN LAST PLACE
IN THE TEMPTATION COMPETITION, I

40:32.197 --> 40:33.632
AM A SPECIAL THIRD NOMINEE.

40:33.665 --> 40:36.735
I HAVE THE POWF TO VETO ONE OF
THE NOMINATIONS.

40:36.768 --> 40:40.806
IF I TAKE MYSELF OFF THE BLOCK
WITH THE VETO, THERE WILL BE NO

40:40.839 --> 40:42.307
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

40:42.340 --> 40:44.543
>> JASON, YOU ARE SO EXTREME!

40:44.576 --> 40:47.746
>> THIS IS EXTREME!

40:47.779 --> 40:49.147
>> YAY!

40:49.180 --> 40:57.055
>> PERFECT.

40:57.088 --> 40:59.825
JASON, I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO ON YOU.

40:59.858 --> 41:04.362
>> EXTREME!

41:04.395 --> 41:08.099
>> ALEX, SINCE I'VE VETOED ONE
OF YOUR NOMINATIONS, YOU WILL

41:08.133 --> 41:17.042
NOW HAVE TO NAME A REPLACEMENT
NOMINEE.

41:17.075 --> 41:20.045
>> I'M SORRY, CODY, I NOMINATE
YOU.

41:20.078 --> 41:25.450
I WASH MY HANDS OF THIS.

41:34.526 --> 41:48.139
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

41:48.173 --> 41:51.877
>> AS MUCH CONFIDENCE AS I DO
HAVE IN OUR PLAN, BEING ON THE

41:51.910 --> 41:54.312
BLOCK IS A REALLY SCARY PLACE.

41:54.345 --> 41:58.216
HOPEFULLY, THINGS GO WELL, AND
WE CAN SEND CODY OUT THE DOOR ON

41:58.249 --> 41:59.317
THURSDAY.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.921
>> I AM CLEARLY THE TARGET FOR
EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSE.

42:02.954 --> 42:08.694
AND THE HOPES OF ME SOMEHOW
SAVING MYSELF JUST... IT'S GRIM.

42:08.727 --> 42:12.898
I NEED ELENA TO JUST SOMEHOW
MAKE HERSELF A BIGGER ENEMY AND

42:12.931 --> 42:14.900
A BIGGER TARGET THAN ME.

42:14.933 --> 42:18.103
>> AM I THIS MUCH WORRIED THAT
ALEX HAS THE CAPABILITY TO

42:18.136 --> 42:20.906
CONVINCE THE HOUSE TO VOTE MOW
OUT THIS WEEK JUST BECAUSE I

42:20.939 --> 42:22.708
STOLE $5,000 FROM HER?

42:22.741 --> 42:25.711
SURELY THE HOUSE IS NOT DUMB
ENOUGH TO VOTE ME OUT JUST

42:25.744 --> 42:28.046
BECAUSE SHE'S IN A BAD MOOD,
RIGHT?

42:28.079 --> 42:31.416
