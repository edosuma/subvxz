WEBVTT

00:00.949 --> 00:02.996
<i>You got to get your shit together.</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:06.589
So you took some licks, but
you're gonna bounce back,

00:06.672 --> 00:08.674
because you're talented, you're smart,

00:08.758 --> 00:10.384
and damn it, you're good.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.845
You are a goddamn American
treasure, you know that?

00:12.929 --> 00:16.641
You are BoJack goddamn Horseman.

00:16.724 --> 00:18.350
So get the hell off my lawn.

00:18.434 --> 00:20.061
Oh.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.855
Here I thought I was at the
drive-through at Carl's Jr.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.690
How much did I have to drink last night?

00:24.774 --> 00:26.985
Last night? Oh, you've been on a bender

00:27.068 --> 00:29.070
for the last two weeks, ever
since you found out Diane

00:29.154 --> 00:30.362
got engaged to Mr. Peanutbutter.

00:30.446 --> 00:32.448
Diane got engaged to Mr. Peanutbutter?

00:32.531 --> 00:34.700
- I need a drink.
- No. No more drinking.

00:34.784 --> 00:36.786
You've been out of control.

00:36.869 --> 00:39.998
Princess Carolyn, look. I met John Stamos.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.791
That is not John Stamos.

00:41.874 --> 00:43.209
Hey, Princess Carolyn,

00:43.292 --> 00:45.753
John Stamos and I got our ears pierced.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.130
That is not your ear.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.633
Princess Carolyn, John Stamos died.

00:50.716 --> 00:53.011
Why? Why, God?

00:53.094 --> 00:55.429
Why did you take John Stamos?

00:55.513 --> 00:57.264
That doesn't sound so bad.

00:57.348 --> 00:59.558
Oh, I forgot to mention you
were naked for a lot of that.

00:59.642 --> 01:03.188
Stamos!

01:03.270 --> 01:05.857
Also, it wasn't here. It was at my office.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.942
We thought night swimming would be fun,

01:08.026 --> 01:10.903
but the current was too strong.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.905
Oh, God, I wasn't driving around, was I?

01:12.989 --> 01:15.074
No. You made Todd your designated driver,

01:15.158 --> 01:17.202
but then you also made him drink with you.

01:17.284 --> 01:20.621
Yeah, I'll have a western
bacon cheeseburger.

01:20.705 --> 01:22.999
BoJack, we are going to
get you back on your feet.

01:23.082 --> 01:25.001
All you need to do is get off Diane

01:25.084 --> 01:26.418
and get on to something else.

01:26.502 --> 01:27.879
- [line rings]
- Hello?

01:27.962 --> 01:29.421
Tony, hi. I'm calling in that favor.

01:29.505 --> 01:31.174
Get your crew to BoJack Horseman's house.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.800
Can you be there in an hour?

01:32.884 --> 01:34.219
- Yeah.
- Great.

01:34.301 --> 01:35.678
What just happened?

01:35.761 --> 01:37.346
You're the new face of Guten Bourbon.

01:37.429 --> 01:38.681
What is Guten Bourbon?

01:38.764 --> 01:39.765
It's an urban German bourbon.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.393
Am I just hungover, or are
you talking like a Muppet?

01:42.476 --> 01:44.187
They're looking for American celebrities

01:44.270 --> 01:45.813
to talk about how much they like to drink.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.565
It's the part you were born to play.

01:47.648 --> 01:50.401
All you have to do is
smile and stay upright.

01:50.484 --> 01:52.444
I don't know. It sounds like a lot of work.

01:52.528 --> 01:54.947
You take up 80% of my time with your drama

01:55.031 --> 01:56.866
and make me 0% of my money.

01:56.949 --> 01:58.284
Do the damn commercial.

01:58.367 --> 01:59.535
[cell phone vibrates]

01:59.618 --> 02:02.454
7:00 A.M. Breakfast with Lenny Turteltaub.

02:02.538 --> 02:04.999
Okay, I got to go. You're in charge, Todd.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.001
Keep this dummy out of trouble.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.460
Hooray, responsibility.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.255
- [vomits]
- Hey.

02:10.336 --> 02:13.258
Do you really believe all that
stuff you said to me earlier

02:13.340 --> 02:16.135
about me being smart and talented and good?

02:16.219 --> 02:20.681
BoJack, I'm an agent. I
believe everything I say.

02:20.765 --> 02:22.183
Ah.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.685
Hey, where the hell is that cheeseburger?

02:24.769 --> 02:26.395
I ordered it, like, an hour ago.

How the hell are you?

03:26.205 --> 03:29.834
I'm in a hurry, so I'll
make this... snappy.

03:29.917 --> 03:31.210
I got some great news about the picture

03:31.294 --> 03:32.295
we're putting together.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.755
- [cell phone rings]
- Sorry. Hello?

03:34.839 --> 03:37.967
Hey, I just wanted to thank
you for getting me this job

03:38.050 --> 03:41.595
and pulling me out of that
oh-so-predictably BoJack

03:41.679 --> 03:43.181
spiral of self-loathing
and substance abuse.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.766
- You really are the best.
- I know. Talk to you later.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.560
I feel like you see things
in me that nobody else sees.

03:48.644 --> 03:50.062
Yep, I'm pretty great. Got to go.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.772
All this time, I never even...

03:51.856 --> 03:53.440
BoJack, I'm in a very
important breakfast right now.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.360
- Okay. I got to go, too.
- Sorry.

03:55.442 --> 03:56.694
What's the great news?

03:56.777 --> 04:00.156
- We got Braff.
- You beautiful dickhead.

04:00.239 --> 04:02.158
You finally got Zach Braff?

04:02.241 --> 04:04.660
Ah, no other director has enough weight

04:04.743 --> 04:07.246
to handle a movie about
the last days of Eva Braun.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.373
No shit, toots.

04:08.455 --> 04:11.083
Ooh, ooh, ooh. There you go.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.377
Thank you, sweetheart.

04:12.459 --> 04:13.544
Everything's coming together.

04:13.627 --> 04:14.920
With Braff directing,

04:15.004 --> 04:16.214
my client Cate Blanchett starring,

04:16.297 --> 04:18.673
and the great Lenny Turteltaub producing,

04:18.757 --> 04:20.551
this movie is a done deal.

04:20.634 --> 04:22.387
Look, honey, I been in this
business a long time, okay?

04:22.469 --> 04:23.888
Long time.

04:23.971 --> 04:26.432
And as I once said to
a young Ed Begley Sr.,

04:26.557 --> 04:28.767
"It ain't a done deal till
the deals are all done."

04:28.851 --> 04:30.395
I'm the best agent in the biz.

04:30.477 --> 04:33.439
I can seal these deals
with my paws in my pants.

04:33.522 --> 04:35.066
Well, then I'll say to you what I once said

04:35.149 --> 04:37.902
to a young Buster Keaton, "What?"

04:37.985 --> 04:41.947
[jazzy music]

[overlapping shouting]

04:47.870 --> 04:50.831
Laura! What's happening?

04:50.915 --> 04:52.833
- We're merging.
- No shit. With what?

04:52.917 --> 04:54.668
FME. A bunch of people got laid off,

04:54.752 --> 04:56.879
and some of the FMEERS
are already moving in.

04:56.962 --> 04:58.797
It's all so sudden and unexpected.

04:58.881 --> 05:02.718
- It was not handled well.
- [laughter]

05:02.801 --> 05:05.179
Oh, shit. Don't tell me
one of the new agents is...

05:05.263 --> 05:06.680
Vanessa Gekko.

05:06.764 --> 05:10.017
That slippery, slimy,
cold-blooded, bug-eyed...

05:10.101 --> 05:11.436
What's new, pussycat?

05:11.518 --> 05:13.312
- Gekko.
- In the flesh.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.522
Ha ha. How are you?

05:15.606 --> 05:17.358
What a morning, huh?

05:17.442 --> 05:19.693
I was in the middle of
my second soul cycle class

05:19.777 --> 05:20.819
when I got the news.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.529
- Can you imagine?
- No.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.907
I was so excited, I rushed home,

05:24.990 --> 05:27.118
made love to my husband of 15 years,

05:27.201 --> 05:29.370
made a hot breakfast for
my three wonderful girls,

05:29.454 --> 05:32.123
read to them, dropped them off
at their elite private school,

05:32.206 --> 05:34.250
and then got my ass
here as quick as I could.

05:34.333 --> 05:37.295
- Um, how old are your kids now?
- I don't have any children.

05:37.378 --> 05:40.172
Oh, well, it'll happen. You're still...

05:41.840 --> 05:43.634
- Anyway...
- Princess Carolyn.

05:43.717 --> 05:47.679
I see you've already met
a new member of the team.

05:47.763 --> 05:50.099
- Vanessa Gekko, sir.
- I know that.

05:50.182 --> 05:52.226
This merger is very exciting.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.019
- I'm pumped.
- I'm beyond pumped.

05:54.103 --> 05:56.563
You should be, or at least
I think you should be.

05:56.647 --> 05:59.233
It's hard to keep track
of who's getting promoted

05:59.317 --> 06:01.319
- and who's getting fired.
- Oh.

06:01.402 --> 06:04.863
You're probably fine or not. Who knows?

06:04.947 --> 06:06.324
[cell phone rings]

06:06.407 --> 06:08.409
Ugh. What do you want, Todd?

06:08.493 --> 06:10.453
Well, good news, bad news.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.664
The bad news is that there
actually is no good news,

06:13.747 --> 06:16.375
and the other bad news is BoJack's gone.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.044
What? Where did he go?
The shoot is at his house.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.672
He just disappeared. I don't
even know why he'd leave.

06:21.755 --> 06:23.924
This charcoal mellowed
bourbon is so smooth,

06:24.008 --> 06:27.261
every time I take a sip, pure happiness.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.054
- That was amazing.
- Really?

06:29.138 --> 06:30.848
Can I get you to say that in a tuxedo?

06:30.931 --> 06:32.766
Hey, I got to go. I think
this is my big break.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.144
Don't worry. I won't let it
get to my head or anything.

06:35.227 --> 06:39.023
Hey, who told that asshole
he could sit in my chair?

06:39.106 --> 06:41.484
Don't forget I'm your
agent, too! I want 10%.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.818
Hello, beautiful.

06:42.901 --> 06:44.403
What the hell are you doing here?

06:44.487 --> 06:46.155
You're supposed to be
shooting a commercial.

06:46.238 --> 06:48.199
I know, but I was sitting
there drinking bourbon and...

06:48.282 --> 06:49.950
They didn't give you fake bourbon on set?

06:50.034 --> 06:51.702
Oh, they did, and then I
just mixed it with bourbon.

06:51.785 --> 06:53.245
And it hit me.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.164
Why was I so upset about
Diane getting engaged?

06:55.247 --> 06:57.542
You're the one who's
always been there for me,

06:57.624 --> 06:59.043
so I drank a lot more bourbon

06:59.126 --> 07:01.086
and drove over to tell you how I feel.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.754
Oh, I see what this is.

07:02.838 --> 07:05.174
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

07:05.257 --> 07:07.301
Clearly we're in love with each other.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.303
You're not in love with me.
You're in love with Diane.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.222
And you're not even
really in love with her.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.764
You just think you are because you pay her

07:12.848 --> 07:14.266
to listen to you talk about yourself.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.767
Diane getting engaged was the best thing

07:15.851 --> 07:17.019
that ever happened to me.

07:17.102 --> 07:19.688
It made me realize you're
the one I need to be with.

07:19.771 --> 07:23.275
Ha! You say that every
time something bad happens.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.985
Not getting nominated for
a People's Choice Award

07:25.069 --> 07:26.737
is the best thing that ever happened to me.

07:26.820 --> 07:28.239
It made me realize...

07:28.322 --> 07:29.907
Getting caught with that pound of cocaine

07:29.990 --> 07:31.742
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

07:31.825 --> 07:33.244
That hooker getting pregnant

07:33.327 --> 07:34.537
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.414
Sneezing on Marisa Tomei was the best...

07:36.497 --> 07:38.874
Every time something bad happens,

07:38.957 --> 07:40.918
you come running to me for comfort.

07:41.001 --> 07:42.794
Well, it's not gonna happen this time.

07:42.878 --> 07:45.005
I can't be your agent and your girlfriend.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.757
- It just doesn't work.
- [knock on door]

07:46.840 --> 07:48.634
I have Lenny Turteltaub for you.

07:48.717 --> 07:50.094
- I have to take this.
- Okay.

07:50.177 --> 07:52.638
But remember, I'm coming for you,

07:52.721 --> 07:55.266
and I'm gonna make you love me.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.184
Please don't. Hey.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.477
Bad news, P.C.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.771
Braff used your merger as
an opportunity to jump ship.

08:00.854 --> 08:01.939
Aw, fish.

08:02.022 --> 08:04.358
Now his new agent's
asking for twice the money.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.611
As I once said to a young Lionel Barrymore,

08:06.693 --> 08:08.695
"Eh, shut up."

08:08.779 --> 08:11.865
Without a director, Eva
Braun is as dead as Eva Braun.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.200
Yep. You got to get someone big.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.786
- What about those brothers...
- Hello? Hello?

08:15.869 --> 08:17.329
Lady, you work too hard.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.373
That was an important phone call.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.500
Important phone call beep boop blorp.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.085
Don't you robot-voice me.

08:23.168 --> 08:25.588
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

08:25.671 --> 08:27.965
Well, I'm working, and you are leaving.

08:28.048 --> 08:30.342
Before I go, I got you
a little sexy something

08:30.426 --> 08:31.885
to remember me by.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.886
Since we can't be together every second,

08:33.971 --> 08:37.182
which would be my preference,
I give you cardboard BoJack.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.725
It's got a light-sensitive sound chip,

08:38.808 --> 08:40.018
so every time you walk by it,

08:40.102 --> 08:41.395
it quotes a line from Jerry Maguire,

08:41.479 --> 08:42.647
your favorite movie.

08:42.729 --> 08:43.981
You complete me.

08:44.063 --> 08:45.274
What do you think? Pretty sweet, huh?

08:45.357 --> 08:46.900
You had me at "hello."

08:46.984 --> 08:49.069
I don't have time for you or cardboard you.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.404
I need to find a new director.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.491
Or you could find my nude erector...

08:53.574 --> 08:54.617
She's gone.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.202
[jazzy music]

08:57.286 --> 08:58.412
[elevator bell dings]

08:58.496 --> 09:01.206
Blech. Word to the wise, Laura...

09:01.290 --> 09:04.001
Do not pitch a Nazi
romance to Steven Spielberg.

09:04.084 --> 09:05.503
Just thought you should know

09:05.586 --> 09:06.878
there's been some reorganization

09:06.962 --> 09:08.880
- vis-a-vis resource management.
- What are you saying?

09:08.964 --> 09:10.716
You and Vanessa Gekko are sharing an office

09:10.799 --> 09:12.468
until they can find her a permanent one.

09:12.551 --> 09:14.386
- The hell we are.
- Also...

09:14.470 --> 09:16.930
Good news, Princess Carolyn.
Vanessa's my agent now.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.056
What?

09:18.140 --> 09:20.017
You said you couldn't be
my girlfriend and my agent,

09:20.100 --> 09:21.686
so I'm firing you.

09:21.768 --> 09:23.312
Now we can be in love.

09:23.395 --> 09:26.231
- Hope you like money, BoJack.
- This is so great.

09:26.315 --> 09:29.067
Now I can date you and have a better agent.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.653
- Everybody wins.
- Oh.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.070
I'm a sporting agent.

09:32.154 --> 09:35.366
Are you still searching for happiness?

09:35.449 --> 09:37.826
Make your own happiness.

09:37.909 --> 09:41.330
Mmm, that's some Guten Bourbon.

09:41.413 --> 09:42.998
Cut. That was great.

09:43.081 --> 09:45.417
Was it? You know, I'm
trying to do good work here,

09:45.501 --> 09:48.379
really find the character,
but it's pretty distracting

09:48.462 --> 09:49.880
to have all these robots

09:49.963 --> 09:52.049
staring at me with their blinking red eyes.

09:52.132 --> 09:54.885
Those are cameras, Todd.
We're making a commercial.

09:54.968 --> 09:56.762
Oh, well, you want to make a good one?

09:56.845 --> 09:58.805
Then get them the hell out of here!

09:58.889 --> 10:02.393
I'm the face of this brand,
I'm the man behind the thing,

10:02.476 --> 10:04.395
and I'm determined to get the jargon

10:04.478 --> 10:08.440
of this German bourbon blurbin'.

10:08.524 --> 10:09.900
Is it just me, or does this fake booze

10:09.983 --> 10:11.777
taste a lot like real booze?

10:12.861 --> 10:14.613
You want BoJack, you can have him.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.699
Here's a list of directors
who won't work with him,

10:16.782 --> 10:18.325
studios that won't hire him,

10:18.409 --> 10:19.493
former assistants with restraining orders.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.911
This is great.

10:20.994 --> 10:22.371
You know, it gets kind of boring

10:22.454 --> 10:24.415
when all your clients are in such demand,

10:24.498 --> 10:26.250
they practically find their own jobs.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.794
Well, then BoJack should
be a lot of fun for you.

10:28.877 --> 10:31.171
- No one wants to hire him.
- [knock on door]

10:31.255 --> 10:34.800
Hello. We're looking for
BoJack Horseman's agent.

10:34.883 --> 10:36.468
We'd like to discuss

10:36.552 --> 10:39.012
a very lucrative business opportunity.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.265
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I'm BoJack's agent.

10:41.348 --> 10:44.393
The opportunity is we're blackmailing you.

10:44.476 --> 10:46.144
Ha. All yours.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.730
Needless to say,

10:47.813 --> 10:50.274
it would be a shame if
these pictures got out.

10:50.357 --> 10:52.651
Fortunately, that can easily be avoided

10:52.735 --> 10:58.657
by simply paying me and
my partner here $150.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.950
Each.

11:00.033 --> 11:01.159
Let me just get my checkbook.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.244
Huh?

11:02.327 --> 11:03.788
- Whoa.
- [chuckles]

11:03.870 --> 11:06.457
Oh, except California law
prohibits taking photos

11:06.540 --> 11:08.375
on private property without a permit,

11:08.459 --> 11:09.460
but you had a permit, right?

11:09.543 --> 11:11.211
- Uh...
- What's that?

11:11.295 --> 11:12.504
Oh, also, extortion can be prosecuted

11:12.588 --> 11:13.672
as a class E felony.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.466
That's four years in prison, easy,

11:15.549 --> 11:17.426
and when you throw in the
murder of Tupac Shakur...

11:17.509 --> 11:18.552
- We didn't do that.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.053
You can't pin that on us.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.597
Well, someone's got to take the fall.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.890
- [both gulp]
- Sorry to bother you.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.017
Forget we were ever here.

11:29.104 --> 11:30.856
That was fun.

11:30.939 --> 11:32.858
Hey, Laura, send those guys
a nice fruit-and-nut basket.

11:32.941 --> 11:34.276
You got it, boss.

11:34.359 --> 11:35.902
Who said you could use my assistant?

11:35.986 --> 11:38.781
- I did.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.449
Did you know the human
head weighs 8 pounds?

11:40.532 --> 11:41.826
Fascinating.

11:41.908 --> 11:44.453
So sorry we have to double up on everything

11:44.536 --> 11:47.456
while we work out who goes
where and who gets fired,

11:47.539 --> 11:50.835
but in the meantime, help
yourself to an intern,

11:50.917 --> 11:53.712
one of the rising stars at our company...

11:53.796 --> 11:57.591
- Charlie Witherspoon.
- Hello. I... Oh.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.886
Sorry, my... My hands are really sticky.

12:00.969 --> 12:03.013
[groans]

12:03.096 --> 12:05.766
Oh, God, am I blowing this?

12:05.850 --> 12:07.476
[glass shatters]

12:07.559 --> 12:10.228
Charlie was the editor
of The Harvard Lampoon.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.772
He can be Princess Carolyn's new assistant

12:11.856 --> 12:12.981
while I use Laura.

12:13.064 --> 12:14.107
- Ugh.
- Good thinking, boss.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.651
[phone rings]

12:15.734 --> 12:18.236
Ah, ah, phone is ringing. Phone is ringing.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.864
What do I do? What do I do?

12:19.946 --> 12:22.574
I'll take it in here, Charlie. Hello.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.035
Princess Carolyn, your
client is out of control.

12:25.118 --> 12:27.120
BoJack is not my client anymore.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.747
Not BoJack. Todd.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.500
I think someone mixed
alcohol into his prop drink.

12:31.583 --> 12:33.043
Oh, you pretenders.

12:33.126 --> 12:34.961
Bourbon is the name of a county.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.798
You can't just make bourbon in Germany.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.842
That would be like
making Rice-A-Roni

12:39.925 --> 12:42.720
- anywhere but San Francisco.
- No, no, no, no, no.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.806
- Ugh. I'll be right there.
- Ow.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.516
You got to get your shit together.

12:47.599 --> 12:50.352
You are a winner, okay?
You are Todd... Hold on.

12:50.435 --> 12:54.231
4:30 P.M. Meeting with Eva Braun team.

12:54.314 --> 12:57.693
Fish. Okay, you are Todd goddamn...

12:57.776 --> 12:59.695
- What's your last name?
- Chavez.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.572
- Your last name is Chavez?
- Yeah. Why?

13:01.655 --> 13:03.073
I don't know, I just never thought of you

13:03.156 --> 13:04.742
as a Chavez. Look, I got to go.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.535
I feel like you didn't
really finish the pep talk.

13:06.618 --> 13:08.119
I know, but I got a movie to put together.

13:08.203 --> 13:09.246
Best of luck.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.249
Ready for the tagline? Here's the tagline.

13:12.332 --> 13:13.333
What the heck is going on?

13:13.458 --> 13:16.294
"The woman who loved the
man who hated everyone."

13:16.420 --> 13:18.422
- That writes itself.
- You got to be kidding me.

13:18.505 --> 13:22.050
Hey, where were you? We looked everywhere.

13:22.133 --> 13:24.261
You're having the Eva
Braun meeting without me?

13:24.344 --> 13:26.054
I'm so sorry,

13:26.137 --> 13:28.181
but I didn't know what the
protocol was around here,

13:28.265 --> 13:30.141
and these guys were
just champing at the bit.

13:30.225 --> 13:32.185
- We're just wrapping up.
- But Cate is my client.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.145
Okay, why don't I come
find you when it's over,

13:34.229 --> 13:35.773
and I'll bring you up to speed?

13:35.856 --> 13:37.858
Is that Quentin Tarantulino?

13:37.942 --> 13:39.735
Yeah. I brought him on board.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.904
You know he's always wanted
to direct a romantic comedy?

13:41.987 --> 13:44.155
Eva Braun is not a romantic comedy.

13:44.239 --> 13:45.574
[sing-song] Bye.

13:45.657 --> 13:47.993
[dramatic music]

13:48.076 --> 13:51.830
We live in a cynical
world, a cynical world.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.082
He's right, you know.

13:54.165 --> 13:57.335
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, over-rotate. Hey.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.004
I just missed an important meeting

13:59.087 --> 14:01.465
because I was babysitting
Todd, who's too drunk to work,

14:01.548 --> 14:03.592
because you switched out the prop bourbon

14:03.675 --> 14:06.386
with the real bourbon.
You are ruining my life.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.639
- Have dinner with me tonight.
- No way.

14:08.722 --> 14:12.225
Come on, just me, you,
and a bottle of Pinot.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.769
Probably more than one
bottle and some entrees.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.562
And I'll probably get an appetizer.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.439
I own the restaurant, so we can go crazy.

14:17.522 --> 14:19.942
- I have to work.
- You don't have to work.

14:20.025 --> 14:23.487
- You choose to work.
- Hmm.

14:23.570 --> 14:25.781
Why not choose to be happy for once?

14:25.864 --> 14:27.783
Mm.

14:27.866 --> 14:30.368
[soft piano music]

14:30.452 --> 14:31.870
When you're writing a memoir,

14:31.954 --> 14:34.706
you spend a lot of time
reflecting on the past.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.584
I regret not being a better friend to you

14:37.668 --> 14:39.294
and lover.

14:39.377 --> 14:40.587
Thank you.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.006
Lover's kind of a weird word,

14:42.088 --> 14:43.674
but thanks.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.759
You want to get out of
this stuffy old restaurant,

14:45.843 --> 14:48.219
get some gelato, and maybe
drive out to the ocean

14:48.303 --> 14:51.598
- and put our feet in the water?
- That sounds great.

14:51.723 --> 14:53.600
Let me just freshen up my whiskers.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.020
Great. I'll get the car
and meet you outside.

14:56.102 --> 14:57.521
You scamper right back, pussycat.

14:57.604 --> 14:59.064
You look at your reflection too long,

14:59.147 --> 15:00.649
you might fall in love. She's gone.

15:00.732 --> 15:03.109
[cell phone rings]

15:03.193 --> 15:04.695
What do you want, Gekko?

15:04.778 --> 15:06.655
Well, I was hoping to
talk to you face-to-face,

15:06.738 --> 15:08.490
but I guess you had to leave work early.

15:08.573 --> 15:10.325
I left at 8:30. What is it?

15:10.408 --> 15:13.745
Well, Cate and I had a
really good talk today.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.622
We have so much in common,

15:15.706 --> 15:17.958
and especially since I'm
doing so much for Eva Braun,

15:18.042 --> 15:20.418
it almost seemed weird
that I wasn't repping her.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.754
No. No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.131
She and I are both
high-powered working mothers,

15:25.215 --> 15:27.551
so I understand her priorities,

15:27.634 --> 15:29.594
so she's switching to Gekko.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.263
Wow, being a mom helped my career?

15:32.347 --> 15:34.432
I really can have it all.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.935
This isn't fair. I know
everything about Cate.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.436
Her favorite color is red.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.230
Her favorite book is Suffragette City.

15:40.313 --> 15:41.857
Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.525
I know all I need to know,

15:43.608 --> 15:45.235
which is that she's
beautiful, she's British,

15:45.318 --> 15:46.653
and she's gonna make me a lot of money.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.613
She's Australian, you moron.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.407
If you need me, I'll be at work.

15:50.490 --> 15:51.867
[sing-song] Bye.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.952
[sing-song] Bye.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.787
Ugh.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.205
[phone rings]

15:57.288 --> 15:59.290
Uh, telephone.

15:59.374 --> 16:00.834
Charlie, get me Cate Blanchett.

16:00.918 --> 16:04.295
Um, who is... Okay, I don't...

16:04.379 --> 16:07.382
Uh, uh, sorry, I can't...

16:07.465 --> 16:09.927
Oh, sticky.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.762
You know what? Never mind.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.973
If Vanessa Gekko wants Cate
that bad, she can have her.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.935
I'm gonna be okay. I'm gonna be happy.

16:18.018 --> 16:21.229
Tonight, I choose to be happy.

16:21.312 --> 16:23.774
Hello? I think I put you on mute.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.859
Good night, Charlie.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.447
[ringtone jingles]

16:30.530 --> 16:33.617
Holy shit.

16:33.700 --> 16:37.203
Herb! How the hell are you, buddy?

16:37.287 --> 16:39.039
Ruin any lives lately?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.499
- Excuse me?
- I got your message, asshole.

16:41.583 --> 16:42.960
[coughs]

16:43.043 --> 16:44.836
You got something to say to me,

16:44.920 --> 16:46.838
you come out to Malibu
and say it to my face.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.300
I'll be alive tomorrow.
After that, who knows?

16:50.383 --> 16:52.260
[beeps off]

16:52.343 --> 16:54.096
[sighs]

16:54.179 --> 16:55.680
Sorry that took me so long.

16:55.764 --> 16:58.266
Just wanted to look my best for you, lover.

16:58.349 --> 17:03.730
Hey, um, I just got kind
of a weird phone call.

17:03.814 --> 17:07.651
You and me both. Hey, screw 'em all, right?

17:07.733 --> 17:09.987
Yeah.

17:10.069 --> 17:11.570
Are we going to gelato?

17:11.655 --> 17:13.865
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

17:13.949 --> 17:15.992
Getting gelato?

17:16.076 --> 17:17.911
[sighs]

17:17.994 --> 17:21.665
This was a mistake. I've been acting crazy.

17:21.748 --> 17:24.626
That phone call just
pulled me back to reality.

17:24.709 --> 17:26.336
You were right. I don't love you.

17:26.419 --> 17:28.797
You don't love me. We're
just two lonely people

17:28.880 --> 17:31.299
trying to hate ourselves a little less.

17:31.382 --> 17:34.052
Maybe that's all we're ever gonna be.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.054
Maybe that's all we ever were.

17:37.055 --> 17:39.099
Well, this night took a turn.

17:41.893 --> 17:45.063
You know the worst part? I
knew this was gonna happen

17:45.147 --> 17:47.816
and I let myself get excited anyway.

17:47.899 --> 17:50.485
So we agree that this is on you, then?

17:55.406 --> 17:57.117
I guess I'll see you around.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.369
You're not even gonna give me a ride home?

17:59.452 --> 18:02.455
Sorry, I think I just
need to be alone right now.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.916
[tires squealing]

18:05.000 --> 18:06.084
[sighs]

18:06.168 --> 18:08.086
Of course, of course.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.839
That's what you get when
you fall for a horse.

18:10.922 --> 18:12.257
Taxi.

18:13.341 --> 18:15.719
You got to get your shit together.

18:15.802 --> 18:17.762
So yesterday, you let yourself
fall in love a little bit,

18:17.846 --> 18:19.556
and you got your heart broken.

18:19.681 --> 18:21.599
Serves you right for having feelings.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.394
Starting now, you are a
hard, heartless career gal.

18:24.477 --> 18:26.354
Go to work, be awesome at it,

18:26.437 --> 18:28.439
and don't waste time on
foolish flights of fancy.

18:28.523 --> 18:30.483
From now on, you are a robot.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.610
Beep bop boop blurp bleep.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.698
[cell phone vibrates]

18:36.781 --> 18:39.201
- Hello.
- I just want you to know I'm fine.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.786
Uh-oh. People only say they're
fine when they're not fine.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.621
Did I hurt your feelings last night?

18:43.705 --> 18:45.540
I'm an agent. I don't have feelings.

18:45.623 --> 18:47.084
Well, I'm glad you called.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.418
I think that you had
the right idea yesterday.

18:48.501 --> 18:49.711
I should be getting back to work.

18:49.794 --> 18:51.421
Can you get me another job?

18:51.504 --> 18:53.257
Yeah, well, I'm not your
agent anymore, so, no.

18:53.339 --> 18:55.884
Oh, right. Well, just tell whoever, then.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.385
- Haah!
- [tires screech]

18:57.468 --> 18:58.636
Whoa.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.597
[honks horn]

19:00.680 --> 19:03.141
Asshole!

19:03.225 --> 19:05.602
Anyway, I'm off to
Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.

19:05.685 --> 19:07.896
He has cancer, which, as
you know, is a whole thing.

19:07.979 --> 19:10.607
Plus, he hates me, so I could
really use some good news

19:10.690 --> 19:11.775
at the end of the day.

19:11.858 --> 19:13.777
Oh, my God, you're going to see Herb?

19:13.860 --> 19:15.112
You must be really...

19:15.195 --> 19:16.988
Nope, don't care. Not interested.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.073
[phone beeps]

19:18.198 --> 19:20.117
Hope you like kicking ass, Charlie,

19:20.200 --> 19:21.993
because that's all we're gonna do today.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.246
My tie got stuck in
the copier this morning.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.747
That's great, Charlie.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.457
If you flip them real quick,

19:27.540 --> 19:30.001
it looks like the tie is running.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.503
Hey, Vanessa, your client,
BoJack Horseman, wants a job.

19:32.587 --> 19:34.380
- Good luck.
- Oh, yeah, about that.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.049
Gwyneth came in this morning,

19:36.133 --> 19:38.093
and I wanted to show her
that she was a top priority,

19:38.176 --> 19:40.011
so I shredded BoJack's contract

19:40.095 --> 19:41.387
right in front of her. Heh heh

19:41.471 --> 19:43.473
What? You just signed BoJack yesterday.

19:43.556 --> 19:46.559
I say good riddance to Mr. Houseman

19:46.643 --> 19:48.353
or whatever that horse's name is.

19:48.436 --> 19:50.688
It's not like he makes
this company any money,

19:50.772 --> 19:53.650
and he does seem to take up
an awful lot of your time.

19:53.733 --> 19:57.112
I'm from Arizona, Jerry.
I went to Arizona State.

19:57.195 --> 19:59.239
Todd, how do I turn this thing off?

19:59.323 --> 20:00.615
Todd.

20:00.698 --> 20:02.575
Todd: What? I'm busy.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.703
BoJack: Never mind.
Think I've figured it out.

20:05.787 --> 20:08.290
Now that I've got the room to myself,

20:08.373 --> 20:10.583
time to practice the trombone.

20:10.667 --> 20:15.713
[trombone plays]

20:15.797 --> 20:17.715
He's kind of in a bad place right now.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.217
You can't just drop him.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.677
The best agent in this building

20:20.760 --> 20:22.262
couldn't get that guy a job.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.347
The best agent in this building

20:23.429 --> 20:24.889
got him a job yesterday,

20:24.973 --> 20:27.225
and I could get him a
feature by the end of today.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.810
If you want to get him a movie

20:28.893 --> 20:30.603
by the end of the day, great, do that.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.689
Otherwise, we are washing our hands of him.

20:32.772 --> 20:36.401
Charlie, I hear NBC picked
up your running tie show.

20:36.484 --> 20:38.444
Congratulations.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.530
Charlie: Thank you, Dad.

20:42.782 --> 20:45.410
Hey, Marty, Princess Carolyn here.

20:45.493 --> 20:48.288
How'd you like to work
with the BoJack Horseman?

20:48.372 --> 20:50.415
What's that? You hate his guts?

20:50.498 --> 20:52.750
What's that? He's a talentless boob?

20:54.627 --> 20:56.796
What's that? You'll never
work with BoJack again?

20:56.880 --> 20:57.964
What's that?

20:58.048 --> 21:00.342
You want him to die in an
ass factory warehouse fire,

21:00.425 --> 21:03.220
smothering to death under
a pile of burning asses?

21:03.303 --> 21:05.680
Well, if you change your
mind, give me a call.

21:05.763 --> 21:07.724
Oh, BoJack, what am I gonna do with you?

21:07.807 --> 21:08.808
I don't understand

21:08.892 --> 21:10.727
why you're going through
all this trouble for him.

21:10.810 --> 21:12.896
That guy's dead weight, Princess Carolyn.

21:12.979 --> 21:15.523
If you don't cut him loose,
you're never gonna be happy.

21:15.606 --> 21:17.275
Help me help you.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.278
That's it. Of course.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.322
Cameron Crow, you skinny bitch.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.158
You know Jerry Maguire's my
favorite movie of all time?

21:25.242 --> 21:26.910
All your films are so human,

21:26.993 --> 21:29.120
which is super impressive
since you're a crow.

21:29.204 --> 21:31.164
Well, my name is Cameron Crow,

21:31.248 --> 21:32.707
but I'm actually a raven,

21:32.790 --> 21:34.667
so common misconception.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.211
- Well, whatever you are...
- A raven.

21:36.294 --> 21:38.880
- I brought you this
- Suffragette City...

21:38.963 --> 21:41.341
"a coming of age story about rock music,

21:41.425 --> 21:45.429
being a teenager in the
'80s and buying zoos"?

21:45.511 --> 21:47.264
How have I not heard of this book?

21:47.347 --> 21:48.432
You'd be the perfect director

21:48.514 --> 21:49.599
to make a movie out of it,

21:49.682 --> 21:51.184
and I happen to know this is

21:51.268 --> 21:52.477
Cate Blanchett's favorite book.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.687
I'll bet she'll drop
everything to play the part.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.647
You should give her a caw.

21:56.731 --> 21:59.484
Okay, I see... Yeah. Caw is what crows say.

21:59.567 --> 22:02.070
Again, I am not a crow.

22:02.153 --> 22:05.449
[jazzy music]

22:05.531 --> 22:08.201
Cate, listen to me, you're
making a big mistake.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.495
Eva Braun is your dream, remember?

22:10.578 --> 22:12.747
Cate? Hello?

22:12.830 --> 22:14.749
Cate!

22:14.832 --> 22:16.542
Oh, no. What happened?

22:16.626 --> 22:18.753
Did Cate drop out of your
little Holocaust movie

22:18.836 --> 22:21.798
so she could make my
little Cameron Crow movie?

22:21.881 --> 22:23.758
Why don't you go home and cry about it

22:23.841 --> 22:25.718
to your loving husband and children?

22:25.802 --> 22:27.304
Say, which one of you

22:27.387 --> 22:29.264
is overseeing the Eva Braun package?

22:29.389 --> 22:31.015
That would be me, sir.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.226
Vanessa, you really
shat the bed on this one.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.686
- Now, are you fired?
- Not exactly.

22:35.770 --> 22:37.522
- Can you still work here?
- No.

22:37.605 --> 22:39.190
Lenny Turteltaub here to see you.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.025
Thanks, Laura.

22:41.109 --> 22:43.111
So, one minute I'm making
a movie with Cate Blanchett.

22:43.194 --> 22:44.988
Next, I hear she's doing
a picture with Cameron Crow

22:45.071 --> 22:46.323
about mix tapes.

22:46.406 --> 22:47.865
As I said to Ed Porter

22:47.949 --> 22:49.575
at the premiere of The Great Train Robbery,

22:49.659 --> 22:51.828
"Aah, the train's coming right at me."

22:51.911 --> 22:53.871
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know, Lenny.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.623
Eva Braun was Vanessa's project.

22:55.706 --> 22:57.250
All that work for nothing.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.419
Now Quentin Tarantulino's
got four arms up my ass

22:59.503 --> 23:01.505
'cause he got all excited
about making a rom-com.

23:01.587 --> 23:03.589
You know what would be
a great romantic comedy?

23:03.673 --> 23:05.967
Remember when that guy stole
the D from the Hollywood sign

23:06.050 --> 23:08.052
so he could propose to his girlfriend?

23:08.136 --> 23:09.929
That would make a great movie,

23:10.013 --> 23:11.306
but who would play the lead?

23:11.431 --> 23:13.517
Preferably someone kind of washed up.

23:13.599 --> 23:14.559
You know how much Quentin

23:14.684 --> 23:15.893
loves to revitalize dead careers.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.479
It's kind of his thing.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.605
Well, in that case,
you know who'd be great?

23:19.689 --> 23:21.941
Show me the money.

23:22.025 --> 23:24.319
[cell phone vibrates]

23:24.402 --> 23:26.279
- Yeah.
- Good news.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.989
You're back in my stable,

23:28.072 --> 23:31.075
and I got you the lead
in a romantic comedy.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.077
Who's the best agent in the world?

23:33.161 --> 23:34.245
What?

23:34.329 --> 23:36.873
I went through hell and back
today, but it was worth it

23:36.956 --> 23:40.210
because I got you a
job. Aren't you excited?

23:40.293 --> 23:42.753
No. I don't know.

23:42.837 --> 23:44.714
I don't care about that.

23:44.797 --> 23:47.758
You... You said you wanted a job.

23:47.842 --> 23:50.345
It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

23:50.428 --> 23:53.931
- Wow. What happened in Malibu?
- I got to go.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.808
[beep]

23:55.892 --> 23:57.727
Need anything else?

23:57.810 --> 24:01.231
No, thanks, Laura. Go
home. I'll see you tomorrow.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.732
Are you gonna head out soon?

24:02.815 --> 24:05.402
Where else would I go?

24:05.485 --> 24:08.488
[upbeat music]

24:15.119 --> 24:16.496
[cell phone vibrates]
