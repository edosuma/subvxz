IF YOU WANT HIM TO TURN YOU ON,

OBVIOUSLY, HE REMEMBERS ME FROM

01:29.400 --> 01:32.200

>> YES, GIRL, AND IT IS MORE

02:06.433 --> 02:07.967

OFFICE TODAY, I WON'T BE ABLE TO

02:16.333 --> 02:17.433
I THOUGHT CHARLES WAS TAKING YOU

02:19.467 --> 02:21.533
>> HE IS, AND IT'S AMAZING.

02:21.533 --> 02:22.467
I DON'T WANT TO BELITTLE OUR

02:22.467 --> 02:24.767
SPIRITUAL CONNECTION, BUT IT

02:24.767 --> 02:25.633
WOULD BE NICE TO GET A QUICKIE

02:25.633 --> 02:26.300
SOMETIMES.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.167
>> OOH, AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH?

02:29.167 --> 02:29.967
WELL, IT'S BEEN A MINUTE.

02:29.967 --> 02:31.400
>> [chuckles]

02:31.400 --> 02:32.700
SEAN'S COMING BACK TO TOWN, AND

02:32.700 --> 02:33.933
FROM ALL THE GIFTS AND ATTENTION

02:33.933 --> 02:35.967
HE'S BEEN SHOWERING ON YOU, I

02:35.967 --> 02:36.833
THINK YOU COULD GET IT ANYTIME

02:36.833 --> 02:37.500
YOU WANT.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.933
>> EH, I STILL DON'T KNOW IF I

02:38.933 --> 02:40.533
WANT TO GO THERE, ALTHOUGH HE'S

02:40.533 --> 02:42.067
STARTING TO GROW ON ME.

02:42.067 --> 02:44.067
I WOULD EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO SAY

02:44.067 --> 02:45.200
I KIND OF MISS HIM.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.300
>> WOW, HE'S MOVED UP IN THE

02:47.300 --> 02:47.967
WORLD.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.067
>> YEAH, MAYBE SO.

02:49.067 --> 02:49.900
WE'LL SEE.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.500
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, I GOT

02:51.500 --> 02:55.067
MONEY TO MAKE.

02:55.067 --> 02:55.733
>> THIS COLLECTION IS

02:55.733 --> 02:56.933
RIDICULOUS.

02:56.933 --> 02:58.567
I SHOULD PUT ALL THIS ON AND BE

02:58.567 --> 02:59.700
THE DISPLAY.

02:59.700 --> 03:00.633
I COULD STRIKE A POSE IN THE

03:00.633 --> 03:03.133
WINDOW EVERY FEW MINUTES.

03:03.133 --> 03:03.933
IT'D BE GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.533
>> LAST TIME WE TRIED THAT, YOU

03:05.533 --> 03:06.933
GOT SIX PHONE NUMBERS, AND I GOT

03:06.933 --> 03:07.800
THREE SHIRTS WITH YOUR SWEAT

03:07.800 --> 03:08.467
STAINS.

03:08.467 --> 03:11.267
SO, UM, LET'S JUST HANG THEM UP.

03:11.267 --> 03:13.267
LOVE YOU THOUGH, HON.

03:17.633 --> 03:19.633

03:19.633 --> 03:21.800
* OR IS IT SO GOOD?

03:21.800 --> 03:23.733
* GOT US ACTING UP

03:23.733 --> 03:24.833

03:24.833 --> 03:25.567

03:25.567 --> 03:27.433
AT LEAST YOU HAVE AN ADMIRER.

03:27.433 --> 03:28.367
>> HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO

03:28.367 --> 03:29.633
TURN THIS GUY DOWN BEFORE HE

03:29.633 --> 03:30.367
GETS IT?

03:30.367 --> 03:31.567
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER TO GUYS SO

03:31.567 --> 03:33.367
LONG AS THEY GET IT.

03:33.367 --> 03:34.600
IT'S LIKE THE LION CHASING A

03:34.600 --> 03:35.800
GAZELLE.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.567
YOU CAN RUN FOR MILES, YOU'RE

03:37.567 --> 03:38.933
GONNA GET TIRED THOUGH.

03:38.933 --> 03:41.833
HE'LL BE RIGHT THERE TO POUNCE.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.733
IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE.

03:43.733 --> 03:45.500
HACOOCHIE-MA-TATA.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.300
>> WHAT'S UP, THICKNESS?

03:47.300 --> 03:48.333
I HOPE THOSE PANTS ARE GETTING

03:48.333 --> 03:49.633
SOME OVERTIME BECAUSE YOU SURE

03:49.633 --> 03:53.533
ARE MAKING THEM WORK.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.133
>> PHIL, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

03:55.133 --> 03:56.100
>> SAME THING YOU DID FOR ME IN

03:56.100 --> 03:57.433

04:06.133 --> 04:06.967
BUT HOW COME I'VE NEVER SEEN

04:06.967 --> 04:07.633

[bell rings]

04:44.633 --> 04:47.400
>> YEAH! HA HA!

04:47.400 --> 04:48.600

04:49.267 --> 04:50.267
HOW THE HELL DOES HE GET KNOCKED

04:50.267 --> 04:53.133

04:58.533 --> 04:59.500
HE'S BEEN PARTYING AT THE

04:59.500 --> 05:01.267

05:01.267 --> 05:01.933
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYING

05:01.933 --> 05:03.433
ATTENTION TO HOW TIGHT HIS SUITS

05:03.433 --> 05:04.333
WERE FITTING, YOU WOULD HAVE

05:04.333 --> 05:05.933
KNOWN THAT HE COULD BARELY MAKE

05:05.933 --> 05:06.667
WEIGHT.

05:06.667 --> 05:09.167
SO, UH...PAY UP.

YOU LOST THE BET.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.067
I SHOULD BE THE ONE WITH MY FEET

07:46.067 --> 07:47.700
>> OKAY.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.367
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST STICK TO

07:49.367 --> 07:51.633
FUN SEX IN THE SUN.

07:51.633 --> 07:52.700
>> OKAY.

07:52.700 --> 07:56.200
>> AND FOR THE RECORD, I AM

07:56.200 --> 07:57.367
READY TO GO THE LONG HAUL WITH

07:57.367 --> 07:59.533
YOU TOO.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.367
>> SO YOU DID NOT TAKE A BITE

08:10.367 --> 08:14.467
OF MY CUPCAKE AND PUT IT BACK?

08:14.467 --> 08:15.867
I MEAN--

08:15.867 --> 08:16.800
NEVER MIND.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.467
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, RAQUEL.

08:18.467 --> 08:19.600
BYE.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.167
[knock at door]

08:24.167 --> 08:27.267
HI.

08:27.267 --> 08:32.333
AW.

08:32.333 --> 08:33.567
>> MM.

08:33.567 --> 08:34.467
>> DID THAT MAKE YOUR ANKLE FEEL

08:34.467 --> 08:35.133
BETTER?

08:35.133 --> 08:37.500
>> OH, MORE THAN JUST MY ANKLE.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.167
>> COME IN.

08:38.167 --> 08:39.767
LET ME FIX YOU A DRINK.

08:39.767 --> 08:42.067
SO HOW WAS D.C., BESIDES YOU

08:42.067 --> 08:43.233
PLAYING RACQUETBALL AND ENDING

08:43.233 --> 08:44.200
UP IN A CAST?

08:44.200 --> 08:46.133
>> WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS, I

08:46.133 --> 08:49.367
WON THE GAME AND THE TRIAL.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.933
BUT THE WHOLE TIME I WAS AWAY, I

08:51.933 --> 08:54.633
WAS ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU.

08:54.633 --> 08:58.667
SEE, CUPCAKES, FLOWERS, ART,

08:58.667 --> 09:00.300
EVEN THAT LUSCIOUS JEWELRY I SAW

09:00.300 --> 09:01.500
YOU CHECKING OUT.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.133
>> FOR FUTURE REFERENCE, I CHECK

09:03.133 --> 09:04.433
OUT PRIVATE PLANES TOO.

09:04.433 --> 09:06.800
>> [laughs]

09:06.800 --> 09:07.767
YOU WATCHED THE FIGHT EARLIER?

09:07.767 --> 09:08.433
>> MM-HMM.

09:08.433 --> 09:09.400
>> WHOSE MONEY DID YOU TAKE,

09:09.400 --> 09:10.700
RAQUEL'S OR APRIL'S?

09:10.700 --> 09:13.100
>> UH, MALCOLM'S.

09:15.767 --> 09:17.067
>> YOU MISSED ME SO MUCH, YOU'VE

09:17.067 --> 09:19.700
BEEN HANGING OUT WITH MALCOLM?

09:19.700 --> 09:20.367
>> SEAN...

09:20.367 --> 09:21.933
>> THIS DUDE IS JUST NOT GOING

09:21.933 --> 09:23.500
TO GO AWAY, IS HE?

09:23.500 --> 09:24.300
AND YOU'RE JUST NOT GONNA LET

09:24.300 --> 09:25.067
GO, ARE YOU, KEISHA?

09:25.067 --> 09:26.733
I MEAN, YOU CONSTANTLY SURPRISE

09:26.733 --> 09:27.400
ME.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.133
I MEAN, YOU--

09:28.133 --> 09:29.533
>> MAY I SPEAK, PLEASE?

09:29.533 --> 09:30.833
CAN I TELL YOU WHAT'S ON MY MIND

09:30.833 --> 09:31.667
INSTEAD OF YOU TELLING ME WHAT'S

09:31.667 --> 09:32.333
ON MY MIND?

09:32.333 --> 09:33.133
>> YEAH.

09:33.133 --> 09:34.633
I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW EXACTLY

09:34.633 --> 09:35.600
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT HEAD OF

09:35.600 --> 09:38.200
YOURS.

09:38.200 --> 09:44.200
>> OKAY.

09:44.200 --> 09:44.967
[sighs]

09:44.967 --> 09:46.400
I NEVER WANTED TO PLAY WITH YOUR

09:46.400 --> 09:47.467
FEELINGS.

09:47.467 --> 09:49.367
BUT I WAS SO FOCUSED ON NOT

09:49.367 --> 09:51.733
MOVING BACKWARDS, I WASN'T

09:51.733 --> 09:54.100
MOVING FORWARD.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.667
I WAS STUCK.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.833
IT WAS LIKE A CLOUD LIFTED

09:57.833 --> 10:01.467
TODAY, AND I REALIZED HOW MUCH

10:01.467 --> 10:04.067
OF A FRIEND YOU'VE BEEN AND THAT

10:04.067 --> 10:07.733
I DO WANT TO TRY.

10:07.733 --> 10:08.733
>> TRY WHAT?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.767
>> TRY US AGAIN.

10:10.767 --> 10:12.633
>> DID I HEAR YOU CORRECTLY?

10:12.633 --> 10:18.633
>> YEAH.

10:18.633 --> 10:21.200
>> I AM GONNA MAKE YOU SO HAPPY

10:21.200 --> 10:22.833
THAT YOU WILL NEVER DOUBT ME

10:22.833 --> 10:23.600
AGAIN.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.233
>> * I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU *

10:26.233 --> 10:28.933
*IF ONLY WHAT YOU SAID *

10:28.933 --> 10:30.300
* WAS TRUE

10:30.300 --> 10:31.100
>> *MY HEART *

10:31.100 --> 10:32.900
>> * MY HEART'S BEEN BROKEN *

10:32.900 --> 10:33.667
*OOH *

10:33.667 --> 10:35.567
>> *MY HEART *

10:35.567 --> 10:38.800
>> *I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU *

10:38.800 --> 10:41.233
*WORDS LEFT UNSPOKEN *

10:41.233 --> 10:44.133
>> * OH OH OOH

10:44.133 --> 10:47.367
>> * I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU *

10:47.367 --> 10:49.533
*OH NO *

10:49.533 --> 10:51.633
>> * CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU *

10:51.633 --> 10:53.767
>> * WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

10:59.367 --> 11:00.633
>> THE FIRST ONE OFFICIALLY

11:00.633 --> 11:04.367
CHANGES THE TITLE OF YOUR LLC.

11:04.367 --> 11:06.100
THIS ONE KEEPS ME ATTACHED AS

11:06.100 --> 11:07.400
YOUR ATTORNEY FOR THE REST OF

11:07.400 --> 11:08.600
YOUR ADULT LIFE.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.267
>> OH, REALLY?

11:09.267 --> 11:10.233
>> [laughs]

11:10.233 --> 11:11.600
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU, I WENT SOFT

11:11.600 --> 11:12.633
IN THE SMALL PRINT.

11:12.633 --> 11:13.867
I ONLY HAVE DIBS ON YOUR FIRST

11:13.867 --> 11:14.533
CHILD.

11:14.533 --> 11:18.067
[both laughing]

11:18.067 --> 11:19.800
>> OKAY, DONE.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.267
THANK YOU SO MUCH, VERONICA, FOR

11:21.267 --> 11:22.200
ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE

11:22.200 --> 11:23.067
FOR ME.

11:23.067 --> 11:25.600
SO PLEASE, PICK OUT AN OUTFIT AS

11:25.600 --> 11:26.600
A BONUS.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.933
>> DON'T THINK I WON'T.

11:27.933 --> 11:29.100
THE WAY MY LOVE LIFE HAS BEEN

11:29.100 --> 11:30.233
GOING, I NEED A LITTLE

11:30.233 --> 11:30.900
PICK-ME-UP.

11:30.900 --> 11:31.867
>> I THOUGHT THINGS WERE GOING

11:31.867 --> 11:32.833
WELL WITH THAT NEW GUY YOU WERE

11:32.833 --> 11:34.067
TELLING ME ABOUT.

11:34.067 --> 11:34.833
>> WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING

11:34.833 --> 11:37.367
LATELY, BUT WHEN I DO SEE HIM,

11:37.367 --> 11:40.800
HE'LL DEFINITELY BE DEBRIEFED.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.500
>> HEY, OMAR, HELP ME CLOSE THIS

11:46.500 --> 11:47.167
BAG.

11:47.167 --> 11:48.100
REGGIE'S PICKING ME UP IN TEN

11:48.100 --> 11:54.100
MINUTES.

11:54.100 --> 11:54.867
>> PROBLEM SOLVED.

11:54.867 --> 11:57.067
>> I NEED ALL THOSE BIKINIS.

11:57.067 --> 11:59.100
>> YES, BUT REGGIE DOESN'T.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.733
THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY OTHER THAN

12:00.733 --> 12:03.300
YOURSELF FOR ONCE, APRIL.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.433
>> [laughs]

12:04.433 --> 12:05.133
>> LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED

12:05.133 --> 12:06.067
DIFFERENT SIZES.

12:06.067 --> 12:09.067
>> OKAY, THANKS.

12:09.067 --> 12:10.300
>> CAN'T YOU CHECK THE RECORDS?

12:10.300 --> 12:11.667
I DEFINITELY HAVE A TAB HERE.

12:11.667 --> 12:12.800
JUST ASK WHAT'S HER NAME.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.500
>> YEAH, WHAT'S HER NAME IS

12:14.500 --> 12:15.267
GONE.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.600
I'M RAQUEL, THE NEW OWNER.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.567
>> FINE.

12:17.567 --> 12:18.367
FORGET IT.

12:18.367 --> 12:19.667
I'LL JUST PAY NOW.

12:19.667 --> 12:20.700
FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE

12:20.700 --> 12:22.100
GONNA STAY IN BUSINESS THIS WAY.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.667
>> CHANGE OF PLANS.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.067
MUSEUM'S CLOSED.

12:25.067 --> 12:25.867
A TORNADO WARNING WAS JUST

12:25.867 --> 12:26.667
ANNOUNCED.

12:26.667 --> 12:27.600
>> DID YOU SAY "TORNADO"?

12:27.600 --> 12:29.433
>> MM.

12:29.433 --> 12:32.700
>> SAVE YOURSELVES!

12:32.700 --> 12:34.500
>> [laughs]

12:34.500 --> 12:35.700
THAT LADY'S CRAZY.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.133
IT'S NOT THAT CLOSE, BUT IT IS

12:37.133 --> 12:38.567
ON THE OUTSKIRTS.

12:38.567 --> 12:39.300
>> I GUESS WE'RE STAYING IN

12:39.300 --> 12:39.967
TONIGHT.

12:39.967 --> 12:40.633
>> HELLO, BABY.

12:40.633 --> 12:42.367
ARE YOU HOME YET?

12:42.367 --> 12:43.067
GOOD.

12:43.067 --> 12:44.467
YOU HEARD ABOUT THE--YES.

12:44.467 --> 12:46.333
IF IT GETS TOO SCARY, GO OVER TO

12:46.333 --> 12:47.667
MS. GABLER'S, OKAY?

12:47.667 --> 12:48.500
LOVE YOU.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.067
BYE.

12:50.067 --> 12:50.800
>> IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE TO GET

12:50.800 --> 12:52.333
HOME TO NICOLE, I UNDERSTAND.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.067
>> OH, NO.

12:53.067 --> 12:54.433
I DON'T DO TORNADOES.

12:54.433 --> 12:55.767
I HAD A UNCLE FROM OKLAHOMA WHO

12:55.767 --> 12:57.067
SCOFFED AT THERE EVER BEING A

12:57.067 --> 12:58.833
REAL TORNADO IN GEORGIA.

12:58.833 --> 13:01.800
HE DROVE RIGHT THROUGH ONE.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.100
WOKE UP IN A PEACH TREE.

13:05.100 --> 13:09.900
[thunder rumbling]

13:09.900 --> 13:13.200
>> [sighs]

13:13.200 --> 13:17.433
[wind howling]

13:17.433 --> 13:18.800
WOW, IT'S GETTING CRAZY OUT

13:18.800 --> 13:19.467
THERE.

13:19.467 --> 13:20.767
>> YEAH, OUR FLIGHT WAS

13:20.767 --> 13:21.433
CANCELLED.

13:21.433 --> 13:22.267
>> DAMN.

13:22.267 --> 13:24.767
OH, BABY.

13:24.767 --> 13:25.533
WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW WITH THESE

13:25.533 --> 13:26.367
SITUATIONS.

13:26.367 --> 13:27.167
MAYBE WE CAN GET OUT LATER

13:27.167 --> 13:27.833
TONIGHT.

13:27.833 --> 13:28.967
>> HOPEFULLY.

13:28.967 --> 13:30.067
WELL, IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S GO

13:30.067 --> 13:30.667
TO MY PLACE.

13:30.667 --> 13:31.733
IT'S CLOSER TO THE AIRPORT IN

13:31.733 --> 13:32.500
CASE OUR FLIGHT GETS

13:32.500 --> 13:33.267
RESCHEDULED.

13:33.267 --> 13:34.633
THEN WE'LL BE THAT MUCH CLOSER

13:34.633 --> 13:35.333
TO PUERTO RICO.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.067
>> YEAH.

13:36.067 --> 13:38.267
ALL RIGHT, BYE, GUYS.

13:38.267 --> 13:43.300
[thunder rumbling]

13:43.300 --> 13:44.467
>> * THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD

13:44.467 --> 13:46.300
*KNOW ABOUT MY GIRL *

13:46.300 --> 13:49.367
[both laughing]

13:49.367 --> 13:51.067
MM.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.500
LET'S GO HAVE DINNER.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.167
>> OOH.

13:57.167 --> 13:59.100
>> WHEREVER YOU LIKE.

13:59.100 --> 14:02.767
>> WELL, UH, HOW ABOUT PARIS?

14:02.767 --> 14:03.733
>> OH.

14:03.733 --> 14:04.533
WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR FRENCH

14:04.533 --> 14:05.200
FRIES?

14:05.200 --> 14:06.833
[both laughing]

14:06.833 --> 14:08.233
OH, I FEEL LIKE A BURGER.

14:08.233 --> 14:11.867
I WORKED UP AN APPETITE.

14:11.867 --> 14:12.533
[thud]

14:12.533 --> 14:14.133
>> OH!

14:14.133 --> 14:16.567
>> LOOKS LIKE TORNADO WEATHER.

14:16.567 --> 14:17.233
[thunder rumbling]

14:17.233 --> 14:18.267
>> WHOO! YEAH.

14:18.267 --> 14:20.900
[wind howling]

14:20.900 --> 14:22.900
[sirens wail]

14:22.900 --> 14:24.067
>> THE SAFEST PLACE IS IN THE

14:24.067 --> 14:25.100
STORAGE ROOM AT THE BOUTIQUE.

14:25.100 --> 14:25.800
>> GOOD IDEA.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.300
>> I'LL GO GRAB US SOME SNACKS.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.933
>> WHO CARES ABOUT THE STORE?

14:29.933 --> 14:31.200
WHAT IF I GET SWEPT UP LIKE

14:31.200 --> 14:32.900
DOROTHY AND TOTO, AND I END UP

14:32.900 --> 14:35.333
IN A HOSPITAL?

14:35.333 --> 14:36.333
OKAY, I'VE GOT MY GOOD DRAWERS

14:36.333 --> 14:37.067
ON.

14:37.067 --> 14:37.667
I'M COOL.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.067
I SUGGEST YOU GUYS CHECK YOUR

14:39.067 --> 14:39.667
OWN.

14:39.667 --> 14:40.567
THINK ABOUT HOW YOU WANT TO MEET

14:40.567 --> 14:41.233
YOUR MAKER.

14:41.233 --> 14:46.067
[thunder rumbling]

14:46.067 --> 14:46.867
>> WHOA.

14:46.867 --> 14:47.533
>> OH.

14:47.533 --> 14:48.633
>> OH, I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

14:48.633 --> 14:49.733
I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT IN ONE

14:49.733 --> 14:50.400
PIECE.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.533
>> YOU MUST BE WORTH IT, BECAUSE

14:51.533 --> 14:53.067
WITH ANY OTHER WOMAN, I SAY,

14:53.067 --> 14:54.100
"SORRY, BUT I'M GONNA BE IN THE

14:54.100 --> 14:56.133
BATHTUB WITH MY HELMET ON."

14:56.133 --> 14:57.067
THEY TELL YOU TO DO THAT ON THE

14:57.067 --> 14:58.067
NEWS.

14:58.067 --> 14:58.900
>> I GUESS WE HAVE TO CELEBRATE

14:58.900 --> 15:00.300
OUR ANNIVERSARY ANOTHER TIME.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.200
>> NO, WE CAN CELEBRATE IT

15:01.200 --> 15:01.933
TONIGHT.

15:01.933 --> 15:02.800
RIGHT HERE.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.833
IF THE TORNADO DOESN'T BLOW THE

15:03.833 --> 15:05.433
ROOF OFF, WE WILL.

15:05.433 --> 15:06.533
>> OH!

15:06.533 --> 15:07.200
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.067
A FOURTH TORNADO JUST TOUCHED

15:08.067 --> 15:09.167
DOWN 30 MILES FROM HERE, IT'S

15:09.167 --> 15:09.833
HEADING THIS WAY.

15:09.833 --> 15:10.800
>> OH, NO!

15:10.800 --> 15:12.067
I LEFT THE WINDOWS IN MY BEDROOM

22:08.467 --> 22:09.267
ARE THAT BIG.

22:09.267 --> 22:09.933
>> OH, TRUE.

22:09.933 --> 22:10.900
IF WE DID DO IT, WE WOULD HAVE

22:10.900 --> 22:13.167
TO FIND A NEW PLACE.

22:13.167 --> 22:14.867
>> THAT'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.

22:14.867 --> 22:15.733
>> OH, DON'T WORRY, BABY.

22:15.733 --> 22:17.267
I LOVE APARTMENT HUNTING.

22:17.267 --> 22:20.367
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SHOW UP.

22:20.367 --> 22:22.933
>> * SO YOUNG AND COMPLICATED

22:22.933 --> 22:24.867
>> I AM THE REASON THEY MAKE

22:24.867 --> 22:25.567
CLOTHES.

22:25.567 --> 22:27.867
I GIVE DESIGNERS' LIVES MEANING.

22:27.867 --> 22:29.267
>> LOVE IT.

22:29.267 --> 22:30.967
LOVE IT.

22:30.967 --> 22:33.267
>> 9.9...OUT OF 100.

22:33.267 --> 22:34.567
[all laughing]

22:34.567 --> 22:35.233
I'M JUST PLAYING.

22:35.233 --> 22:36.200
IT'S CUTE.

22:36.200 --> 22:36.867
>> THANKS.

22:36.867 --> 22:37.867
SHAME WE DON'T HAVE A RUNWAY FOR

22:37.867 --> 22:39.200
ME TO WORK.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.533
>> EH, LET ME GET A PICTURE.

22:41.533 --> 22:42.533
>> REALLY?

22:42.533 --> 22:43.500
YOU LIKE THAT?

22:43.500 --> 22:44.533
>> YEAH, I LIKE A MAN WHO CARES

22:44.533 --> 22:45.333
ABOUT HIS STYLE.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.733
>> BUT IF A MAN CARES TOO MUCH,

22:46.733 --> 22:48.100
HE MIGHT GIVE OFF A METROSEXUAL

22:48.100 --> 22:49.067
VIBE.

22:49.067 --> 22:49.833
>> I AGREE.

22:49.833 --> 22:51.333
FASHION FOR MEN SEEMS LIKE SOME

22:51.333 --> 22:53.567
JOKE PERPETRATED BY WEIRDOS.

22:53.567 --> 22:54.700
>> IF IT WEREN'T FOR SOME 19TH

22:54.700 --> 22:56.067
CENTURY "WEIRDO" NAMED BEAU

22:56.067 --> 22:57.067
BRUMMELL, YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BE

22:57.067 --> 22:58.233
WEARING PANTS.

22:58.233 --> 22:59.500
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

22:59.500 --> 23:00.600
'CAUSE I SURE AS HELL WOULDN'T

23:00.600 --> 23:01.400
BE WEARING A SKIRT.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.500
[all laughing]

23:03.500 --> 23:04.567
>> OH, YOU NEED A LESSON, DON'T

23:04.567 --> 23:05.633
YOU?

23:05.633 --> 23:06.333
BRUMMELL CONVINCED

23:06.333 --> 23:08.367
KING GEORGE IV TO REPLACE KNEE

23:08.367 --> 23:09.867
BREECHES AND STOCKINGS WITH

23:09.867 --> 23:11.400
TROUSERS AND MORNING COATS,

23:11.400 --> 23:12.767
WHICH LED TO THE MODERN-DAY

23:12.767 --> 23:13.900
BUSINESS SUIT.

23:13.900 --> 23:14.567
>> REALLY?

23:14.567 --> 23:15.400
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.500
>> THINK ABOUT THIS.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.267
IN TWO YEARS, YOU'LL ALL BE

23:18.267 --> 23:19.267
WEARING SOME WATERED-DOWN

23:19.267 --> 23:20.433
VERSION OF MY OUTFIT.

23:20.433 --> 23:23.067
SO IF FASHION IS A JOKE, THE

23:23.067 --> 23:25.600
JOKE IS LITERALLY ON YOU.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.267
>> WOW.

23:26.267 --> 23:27.567
>> LOOK, I LIKE TO LOOK GOOD

23:27.567 --> 23:29.767
TOO, BUT ISN'T HE TAKING IT A

23:29.767 --> 23:31.267
LITTLE TOO SERIOUS?

23:31.267 --> 23:32.500
IT'S JUST CLOTHES.

23:32.500 --> 23:33.533
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU THINK

23:33.533 --> 23:34.700
WHAT WE DO FOR A LIVING IS

23:34.700 --> 23:36.433
FRIVOLOUS?

23:36.433 --> 23:38.400
>> UH, NO.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.200
THAT'S THE CORRECT ANSWER,

23:39.200 --> 23:40.533
RIGHT?

23:40.533 --> 23:41.900
I RESPECT YOU DO WHAT YOU'VE GOT

23:41.900 --> 23:43.067
TO DO TO MAKE A LIVING BECAUSE

23:43.067 --> 23:44.067
WE ALL DO THAT.

23:44.067 --> 23:45.100
BUT SELLING CLOTHES ISN'T

23:45.100 --> 23:46.933
EXACTLY SAVING LIVES.

23:46.933 --> 23:49.433
>> AND DRIVING A BUS IS?

23:49.433 --> 23:51.267
>> WITHOUT ME, A DOCTOR TRYING

23:51.267 --> 23:52.800
TO FIND A CURE FOR CANCER MAY

23:52.800 --> 23:54.400
NOT MAKE IT TO WORK.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.533
>> WELL, THEN, LET ME CALL

23:55.533 --> 23:57.067
SWEDEN AND NOMINATE YOU FOR THE

23:57.067 --> 23:58.100
NOBEL PRIZE.

23:58.100 --> 23:58.967
>> WELL, MAKE SURE THEY SPELL MY

23:58.967 --> 24:00.067
NAME RIGHT.

24:00.067 --> 24:02.367
J-O-BARI.

24:02.367 --> 24:05.167
[all laughing]

24:05.167 --> 24:08.933
[thunder rumbling]

24:08.933 --> 24:11.100
>> THIS SUIT IS FROM ITALY, THE

24:11.100 --> 24:12.367
OLD COUNTRY.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.533
>> [whistles]

24:13.533 --> 24:14.300
>> WHERE THEY'VE HAPPILY

24:14.300 --> 24:15.667
CELEBRATED MEN'S FASHION FOR

24:15.667 --> 24:17.067
CENTURIES.

24:17.067 --> 24:19.067
>> NOW THAT IS A SUIT.

24:19.067 --> 24:21.333
THAT I WOULD WEAR.

24:21.333 --> 24:22.100
>> BABE, THAT WOULD LOOK GOOD ON

24:22.100 --> 24:22.767
ME.

24:22.767 --> 24:23.567
DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD LOOK

24:23.567 --> 24:24.267
GOOD ON ME?

24:24.267 --> 24:24.900
>> YES.

24:24.900 --> 24:25.600
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD ON YOU,

24:25.600 --> 24:26.267
BABY.

24:26.267 --> 24:26.933
>> LET ME FEEL THE FABRIC.

24:26.933 --> 24:29.800
>> LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.600
JUST PLAYING. TOUCH AWAY.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.533
[all laughing]

24:32.533 --> 24:34.467
THAT, MY FRIEND, IS 100% VIRGIN

24:34.467 --> 24:35.567
LAMB'S WOOL.

24:35.567 --> 24:36.700
>> AS OPPOSED TO THE SLUTTY

24:36.700 --> 24:38.067
SHEEP'S WOOL THE REST OF US

24:38.067 --> 24:39.233

24:39.233 --> 24:41.400
>> WELL, KEISHA, IF THE SHEEP

24:41.400 --> 24:42.067
FITS.

24:42.067 --> 24:42.733
>> WHOA!

24:42.733 --> 24:43.567
>> OH!

24:43.567 --> 24:44.633
>> GET HIM, GIRL.

24:44.633 --> 24:47.567
[all laughing]

24:50.633 --> 24:55.400
[both laughing]

24:55.400 --> 24:57.067
>> WHA--I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE

24:57.067 --> 24:58.300
LAST OF MY TRUFFLES.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.467
>> RELAX.

24:59.467 --> 25:00.700
YOU KNOW I KNOW BETTER THAN TO

25:00.700 --> 25:02.133
MESS WITH YOUR CRACK.

25:02.133 --> 25:03.600
>> 'CAUSE THAT TORNADO OUTSIDE

25:03.600 --> 25:04.967
IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE

25:04.967 --> 25:06.267
HURRICANE THAT WAS ABOUT TO HIT

25:06.267 --> 25:06.900
IN HERE.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.567
[all laughing, oohing]

25:08.567 --> 25:09.967
>> SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU

25:09.967 --> 25:11.833
TWO BEEN TOGETHER?

25:11.833 --> 25:13.067
>> NOT THAT LONG.

25:13.067 --> 25:15.533
>> NOT THAT LONG, AS IN A WEEK?

25:15.533 --> 25:16.533
TWO?

25:16.533 --> 25:17.267
A MONTH?

25:17.267 --> 25:18.067
>> VERONICA--

25:18.067 --> 25:19.133
>> ANY PARTICULAR REASON WHY IT

25:19.133 --> 25:20.067
MATTERS?

25:20.067 --> 25:20.967
>> IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

25:20.967 --> 25:22.267
>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

25:22.267 --> 25:23.100
>> IS IT NOW?

25:23.100 --> 25:23.933
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO HER,

25:23.933 --> 25:25.367
SEAN?

25:25.367 --> 25:26.800
>> KEISHA, IT WAS NOTHING.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.067
>> UP UNTIL RECENTLY, IT WAS

25:28.067 --> 25:29.567
DEFINITELY SOMETHING.

25:29.567 --> 25:31.267
THEN YOU JUST DISAPPEARED.

25:31.267 --> 25:32.367
NOW I KNOW WHY.

25:32.367 --> 25:33.400
YOU'RE THE REASON HE STOPPED

25:33.400 --> 25:36.067
SLEEPING WITH ME.

25:36.067 --> 25:38.367
[thunder rumbling]

25:42.200 --> 25:44.300
>> LOOK, VERONICA, IF YOU INSIST

25:44.300 --> 25:45.867
ON HAVING THIS CONVERSATION NOW,

25:45.867 --> 25:47.067
CAN WE AT LEAST GO IN THE OFFICE

25:47.067 --> 25:48.267
AND HAVE IT IN PRIVATE?

25:48.267 --> 25:49.767
>> ACTUALLY, I'M QUITE

25:49.767 --> 25:51.200
INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT ELSE

25:51.200 --> 25:52.967
VERONICA HAS TO SAY.

25:52.967 --> 25:54.067
GO AHEAD, GIRL.

25:54.067 --> 25:55.667
>> KEISHA, PLEASE.

25:55.667 --> 25:56.800
CAN I JUST HANDLE THIS, AND

25:56.800 --> 25:57.900
WE'LL TALK IN A MINUTE?

25:57.900 --> 25:59.233
>> OKAY, HANDLE IT.

25:59.233 --> 26:01.467
BUT I JUST FIND IT INTERESTING

26:01.467 --> 26:02.667
THAT YOU'VE BEEN STEPPING TO ME

26:02.667 --> 26:05.800
SO HARD, SWEARING THE WHOLE TIME

26:05.800 --> 26:07.700
THAT YOU ARE ALL ABOUT ME.

26:07.700 --> 26:08.600
>> DON'T THEY ALWAYS TELL THAT

26:08.600 --> 26:09.267
LIE?

26:09.267 --> 26:10.067
>> HOLD UP.

26:10.067 --> 26:12.400
I NEVER LIED TO ANYONE.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.067
I AM ABOUT YOU, KEISHA.

26:14.067 --> 26:14.833
BUT YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING ME TO

26:14.833 --> 26:16.300
THE LEFT FOR MONTHS.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.567
>> I WASN'T PLAYING YOU, SEAN.

26:18.567 --> 26:19.833
I WAS DOING WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR

26:19.833 --> 26:20.500
ME.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.633
>> SO I DID WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR

26:21.633 --> 26:22.300
ME.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.533
I'M A MAN, I HAVE NEEDS.

26:24.533 --> 26:25.600
AND WHILE I WAITED FOR YOU TO

26:25.600 --> 26:28.967
COME AROUND, I GOT THEM MET.

26:28.967 --> 26:30.567
>> NICE.

26:30.567 --> 26:32.400
>> HEY, IT WAS NEVER SERIOUS,

26:32.400 --> 26:33.900
VERONICA.

26:33.900 --> 26:34.767
WE BOTH KNEW WE WERE JUST

26:34.767 --> 26:35.433
HOOKING UP.

26:35.433 --> 26:36.800
>> I THOUGHT THERE WAS A CHANCE

26:36.800 --> 26:37.633
FOR MORE.

26:37.633 --> 26:39.067
THINGS WERE GOING SO WELL, AND

26:39.067 --> 26:40.533
THEN SUDDENLY YOU REFUSED TO

26:40.533 --> 26:42.433
RETURN MY CALLS.

26:42.433 --> 26:43.100
NEVER MIND.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.533
>> OH, I'M SURPRISED AT SEAN.

26:44.533 --> 26:45.400
JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNOW

26:45.400 --> 26:46.567
SOMEONE.

26:46.567 --> 26:47.467
>> BUT HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

26:47.467 --> 26:48.467
WRONG.

26:48.467 --> 26:49.133
>> NEVER MIND.

26:49.133 --> 26:51.933
YOU HAVE TO BE A GIRL TO GET IT.

26:51.933 --> 26:52.900
>> I'M SORRY ABOUT THE WAY I

26:52.900 --> 26:55.167
HANDLED THINGS.

26:55.167 --> 26:59.733
I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE ME.

26:59.733 --> 27:00.667
>> WOW.

27:00.667 --> 27:02.100
>> ONCE YOU OPEN THE DOOR TO SEX

27:02.100 --> 27:03.300
IN A RELATIONSHIP, YOU OPEN THE

27:03.300 --> 27:05.167
DOOR TO ALL KINDS OF DRAMA AND

27:05.167 --> 27:06.433
EMOTIONS.

27:06.433 --> 27:08.167
I'M GLAD WE'VE KEPT IT SIMPLE.

27:08.167 --> 27:09.733
>> HMM, THAT'S THE TRUTH.

27:09.733 --> 27:11.533
IT'S BETTER TO TAKE THINGS SLOW.

27:11.533 --> 27:12.667
GET TO KNOW A PERSON.

27:12.667 --> 27:14.167
>> YEAH, LIKE WE'RE DOING.

27:14.167 --> 27:16.500
THEN YOU CAN HAVE WHAT WE HAVE.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.267
>> both: BLISS.

27:18.267 --> 27:19.567
>> * JUST TO FIND IT

27:19.567 --> 27:20.933
* WASN'T ENOUGH *

27:20.933 --> 27:22.700
* BUT I PROMISED

27:22.700 --> 27:25.167
* THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT

27:25.167 --> 27:25.933
* FOR YOU AND ME

27:25.933 --> 27:26.900
>> I'M REALLY SORRY YOU HAD TO

27:26.900 --> 27:28.533
HEAR THAT.

27:28.533 --> 27:30.133
BUT IT'S THE PAST.

27:30.133 --> 27:31.800
AND I'M ALL ABOUT US UNTIL THE

27:31.800 --> 27:34.300
WHEELS FALL OFF.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.500
YOU BELIEVE ME, RIGHT?

27:36.500 --> 27:38.500
>> OF COURSE I DO.

27:42.800 --> 27:43.567
>> I'M GONNA GO GET SOME MORE

27:43.567 --> 27:44.400
WINE.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.067
>> OKAY.

27:45.067 --> 27:49.767
>> ALL RIGHT.

SORRY MAN, MY BAD, UM...

28:02.833 --> 28:03.767
MIND IF I COME IN?

28:03.767 --> 28:04.467
I JUST NEED A BREAK FROM OUT

28:04.467 --> 28:05.133
THERE.

28:05.133 --> 28:06.300
>> OKAY.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.333
BUT NO PICTURES.

28:07.333 --> 28:08.567
I BETTER NOT SEE THIS BODY ON

28:08.567 --> 28:09.400
INSTAGRAM.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.700
>> YEAH, TRUST ME.

28:10.700 --> 28:12.900
I JUST NEED A DRINK.

28:12.900 --> 28:13.833
>> SHOULDN'T NOBODY BE THIS

28:13.833 --> 28:16.633
PRETTY.

>> YOU OKAY?

28:22.100 --> 28:23.700
>> YEAH.

28:23.700 --> 28:26.933
I CAN'T REALLY BE MAD AT SEAN.

28:26.933 --> 28:30.667
IT'S NOT LIKE HE CHEATED ON ME.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.200
BUT I DO FEEL BAD FOR HER.

IT'S GETTING A LITTLE STRESSFUL

29:02.433 --> 29:03.633
OUT THERE.

29:03.633 --> 29:05.200
>> A LITTLE?

29:05.200 --> 29:06.467
HAVING YOUR GIRL MEET YOUR BOOTY

29:06.467 --> 29:08.167
CALL ISN'T EXACTLY THE FORMULA

29:08.167 --> 29:10.767
FOR A RELAXING EVENING.

29:10.767 --> 29:12.300
BUT YOU AND APRIL LOOK GOOD.

29:12.300 --> 29:13.900
>> MAYBE TOO GOOD.

29:13.900 --> 29:14.933
I MEAN, WE'VE ONLY BEEN TOGETHER

29:14.933 --> 29:16.133
FOR A MINUTE, AND SHE'S ALREADY

29:16.133 --> 29:17.700
TALKING ABOUT SHACKING UP.

29:17.700 --> 29:18.900
SHE'S TRIPPING.

29:18.900 --> 29:19.800
>> YOU JUST SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO

29:19.800 --> 29:20.933
ME.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.767
LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES, REG.

29:22.767 --> 29:23.867
KEEP IT HONEST.

29:23.867 --> 29:25.867
>> YEAH, I GUESS.

29:30.700 --> 29:32.367
WHICH WAY IS THE BATHROOM?

29:32.367 --> 29:33.100
>> THROUGH THE DOOR, TO THE

29:33.100 --> 29:34.300
LEFT.

29:34.300 --> 29:40.200
>> THANKS.

29:40.200 --> 29:43.800
>> FOR DAYTIME, PLAYTIME, FOR

29:43.800 --> 29:45.700
COME-WHAT-MAY TIME.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.833
>> DID YOU NOT GET A LOT OF

29:46.833 --> 29:48.633
ATTENTION AS A CHILD?

29:48.633 --> 29:51.067
>> JEEZ.

29:56.167 --> 29:57.133
>> HEY.

29:57.133 --> 29:58.800
>> HEY.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.067
>> HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

30:00.067 --> 30:01.133
THIS MUST BE KIND OF ROUGH ON

30:01.133 --> 30:02.600
YOU.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.567
>> STANDING IN A BALL GOWN,

30:05.567 --> 30:06.400
TRAPPED WITH A BUNCH OF

30:06.400 --> 30:08.000
STRANGERS WHO JUST WITNESSED THE

30:08.000 --> 30:09.867
MOST HUMILIATING MOMENT IN MY

30:09.867 --> 30:11.267
LIFE.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.833
YEAH, IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY.

30:13.833 --> 30:16.033
>> OKAY.

30:16.033 --> 30:17.400
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISREAD HIM

30:17.400 --> 30:18.700
LIKE THAT.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.700
I FEEL SO STUPID.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.067
>> DON'T.

30:22.067 --> 30:25.267
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

30:25.267 --> 30:27.300
I'VE GOT TWO TRUFFLES LEFT.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.933
HERE.

30:29.933 --> 30:31.500
>> I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

30:31.500 --> 30:33.600
THAT WE BOTH FELL FOR THE SAME

30:33.600 --> 30:35.167
GUY.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.467
IT'S JUST SO HARD TO FIND

30:37.467 --> 30:41.400
SOMEONE WHO GIVES EVERYTHING TO

30:41.400 --> 30:46.800
YOU, EVEN ON THEIR BAD DAYS.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.400
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU HAVE THAT.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.800
>> YEP.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.033
ENJOY YOUR CHOCOLATES.

30:59.567 --> 31:00.300
>> DO YOU KNOW WHERE REGGIE

31:00.300 --> 31:01.067
WENT?

31:01.067 --> 31:02.633
>> UH, THE BATHROOM.

31:02.633 --> 31:03.467
>> OH.

31:03.467 --> 31:05.600
EXCUSE ME.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.600
>> [chuckles]

31:09.233 --> 31:12.300
[both chuckle]

31:12.300 --> 31:14.067
>> WHAT?

31:14.067 --> 31:14.867
>> SINCE MY LAST NAME IS

31:14.867 --> 31:17.067
FREEMAN, IF WE GOT MARRIED,

31:17.067 --> 31:18.400
YOU'D BE MORGAN FREEMAN.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.300
[both laughing]

31:20.300 --> 31:24.467
>> OR I'D BE MORGAN THOMAS.

31:24.467 --> 31:26.300
>> HOLD UP, IF I WERE TO HONOR

31:26.300 --> 31:28.133
YOU BY ASKING FOR YOUR HAND, YOU

31:28.133 --> 31:29.200
WOULDN'T HONOR ME BY TAKING MY

31:29.200 --> 31:30.867
NAME?

31:30.867 --> 31:32.800
>> THE HONOR WOULD BE IF I SAID

31:32.800 --> 31:34.400
YES.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.200
I WAS BORN MORGAN THOMAS, MADE

31:36.200 --> 31:37.400
MY WAY IN THE WORLD AS MORGAN

31:37.400 --> 31:38.433
THOMAS, AND I'M GONNA DIE

31:38.433 --> 31:39.200
MORGAN THOMAS.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.733
IN FACT, "THOMAS" IS A GREAT

31:41.733 --> 31:43.067
LAST NAME.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.400
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER TAKING

31:44.400 --> 31:46.167
THAT.

31:46.167 --> 31:47.200
>> THE DUDE THAT WILL TAKE HIS

31:47.200 --> 31:49.300
WIFE'S NAME IS THE SAME ONE WHO

31:49.300 --> 31:51.067
WILL WEAR THAT FIRST OUTFIT OMAR

31:51.067 --> 31:51.800
HAD ON.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.233
REAL TALK.

31:54.233 --> 31:56.400
>> WELL, I DON'T LIKE SOUR

31:56.400 --> 31:58.633
PICKLES, I LIKE SWEET.

31:58.633 --> 32:00.500
REAL TALK.

32:03.733 --> 32:05.533
>> I CAN'T FIND REGGIE.

32:05.533 --> 32:06.600
>> HE'S NOT IN THE BATHROOM?

32:06.600 --> 32:07.433
>> NOT IN THE BATHROOM, THE

32:07.433 --> 32:08.667
STORE, ANYWHERE.

32:08.667 --> 32:12.200
IT'S LIKE HE'S GONE.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.300
[wind howling]

32:13.300 --> 32:19.133
>> [moaning]

32:19.133 --> 32:22.067
>> OH.

32:22.067 --> 32:22.733
WOW.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.867
>> [laughs]

32:24.867 --> 32:26.867
YEAH.

32:37.267 --> 32:41.400
I LOVE YOU.

32:41.400 --> 32:45.267
>> UM...

32:45.267 --> 32:51.300
THANK YOU?

32:51.300 --> 32:52.067
[thunder rumbling]

32:52.067 --> 32:53.500
[sirens wail]

32:53.500 --> 32:55.133
>> THE SIRENS ARE STILL GOING,

32:55.133 --> 32:56.300
AND THAT BIG OAK TREE FELL INTO

32:56.300 --> 32:58.200
THE STREET.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.267
NO.

32:59.267 --> 33:00.233
>> WHY WOULD HE JUST RUN OUT OF

33:00.233 --> 33:01.300
HERE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO

33:01.300 --> 33:02.867
ME?

33:02.867 --> 33:03.933
[phone vibrating]

33:03.933 --> 33:05.133
OH, GOD, IT'S REGGIE.

33:05.133 --> 33:08.300
"I CAN'T DO THIS. I'M SORRY"?

33:08.300 --> 33:09.167
>> MAYBE HE JUST GOT A LITTLE

33:09.167 --> 33:10.533
STIR-CRAZY BEING TRAPPED IN

33:10.533 --> 33:11.300
HERE.

33:11.300 --> 33:12.800
>> OR MAYBE HE'S JUST PLAIN

33:12.800 --> 33:14.733
CRAZY BECAUSE IT'S CRAZY HE

33:14.733 --> 33:15.500
LEFT.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.367
>> I DON'T GET IT.

33:16.367 --> 33:17.733
WHAT CAN'T YOU DO?

33:17.733 --> 33:18.933
CAN'T STAY IN THIS STOREROOM?

33:18.933 --> 33:19.767
YOU CAN'T GO TO PUERTO RICO?

33:19.767 --> 33:21.267
LIKE, WHAT?

33:21.267 --> 33:22.733
>> DID YOU GET IN AN ARGUMENT?

33:22.733 --> 33:24.200
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.067
HE WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE TRIP.

33:26.067 --> 33:28.200
HE EVEN SAID HE WAS READY TO

33:28.200 --> 33:29.800
GO THE LONG HAUL WITH ME.

33:29.800 --> 33:30.633
I MEAN, THOSE ARE DEFINITE

33:30.633 --> 33:31.800
INDICATIONS THAT EVERYTHING IS

33:31.800 --> 33:33.400
BETTER THAN GOOD WITH US, SO

33:33.400 --> 33:35.767
I'M--I'M BAFFLED.

33:35.767 --> 33:37.867
>> APRIL, I THINK YOU MAY HAVE

33:37.867 --> 33:39.067
CAUGHT REGGIE OFF GUARD WHEN YOU

33:39.067 --> 33:40.067
STARTED TALKING ABOUT LIVING

33:40.067 --> 33:40.767
TOGETHER.

33:40.767 --> 33:41.667
WELL, AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT HE

33:41.667 --> 33:42.800
TOLD ME.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.167
>> WELL, EXACTLY WHAT ELSE DID

33:44.167 --> 33:45.267
HE TELL YOU?

33:45.267 --> 33:46.100
DON'T HOLD OUT ON MY GIRL.

33:46.100 --> 33:46.767
YOU SEE SHE'S OVER THERE

33:46.767 --> 33:48.067
FREAKING OUT.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.533
>> MOVING IN TOGETHER FELT TOO

33:49.533 --> 33:51.400
SUDDEN FOR HIM.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.900
YOU FREAKED HIM OUT.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.067
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THE GUY SOME

33:54.067 --> 33:56.500
SPACE TO CATCH UP TO WHERE YOU

33:56.500 --> 33:57.200
ARE.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.100
>> I WAS TALKING HYPOTHETICALLY.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.333
BUT HE SEEMED INTO IT, SO I KEPT

34:00.333 --> 34:01.600
GOING.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.600
>> IF YOU MAKE THAT CLEAR, I'M

34:02.600 --> 34:04.133
SURE YOU GUYS WILL WORK IT OUT.

34:04.133 --> 34:05.200
>> BUT WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE JUST

34:05.200 --> 34:06.400
STAYED AND TOLD ME THAT?

34:06.400 --> 34:09.500
I AM SO PISSED RIGHT NOW.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.100
>> CAN YOU BELIEVE HIM?

34:11.100 --> 34:12.300
>> I'M GLAD I'M PAST MY DUMB

34:12.300 --> 34:13.767
PHASE.

34:13.767 --> 34:16.600
I TOLD HIM TO BE HONEST.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.200
EVEN IF IT HURTS, EVERYBODY

34:18.200 --> 34:22.067
DESERVES THAT.

34:26.067 --> 34:28.700
>> I CALL THIS OMAR AFTER DARK.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.133
>> I LOVE THAT TUX, MAN.

34:30.133 --> 34:32.567
BUT THE PANTS ARE KIND OF TIGHT.

34:32.567 --> 34:33.533
>> WHICH IS WHY I WORE MY

34:33.533 --> 34:35.067
CAREFULLY SELECTED BOXER BRIEFS

34:35.067 --> 34:37.633
TO REIN IN MY GREATNESS.

34:37.633 --> 34:43.567
KEISHA GETS DISTRACTED EASILY.

34:43.567 --> 34:46.900
>> THANK YOU FOR A LOVELY MEAL

34:46.900 --> 34:48.767
AND A LOVELY THREE WEEKS.

34:48.767 --> 34:50.300
>> THIS AIN'T NOTHING.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.500
WAIT UNTIL NEXT WEEK ROLLS

34:51.500 --> 34:52.700
AROUND.

34:52.700 --> 34:54.333
>> YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING

34:54.333 --> 34:55.800
ABOUT OUR CONVERSATION.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.433
IF WE DID GET MARRIED, I'D LET

34:58.433 --> 34:59.900
THE KIDS HAVE YOUR NAME.

34:59.900 --> 35:01.800
>> THAT'S PRETTY BIG OF YOU, BUT

35:01.800 --> 35:02.533
I DON'T WANT KIDS.

35:02.533 --> 35:03.200
>> PLEASE.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.900
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY NOW.

35:04.900 --> 35:05.567
>> I'M SERIOUS.

35:05.567 --> 35:06.667
I'M NOT HAVING KIDS.

35:06.667 --> 35:08.067
>> BUT WHY NOT?

35:08.067 --> 35:10.900
>> BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THEM

35:10.900 --> 35:11.833
THAT MUCH.

35:11.833 --> 35:13.200
NEVER HAVE.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.967
BUT YOURS IS ALMOST GROWN, SO

35:14.967 --> 35:16.067
SHE CAN'T BUG US THAT MUCH

35:16.067 --> 35:16.833
'CAUSE SHE'LL BE OUT OF THE

35:16.833 --> 35:20.867
HOUSE SOON.

35:20.867 --> 35:24.100
THIS IS GONNA BE A PROBLEM, HUH?

35:24.100 --> 35:27.600
>> I LOVE BEING A MOTHER, AND I

35:27.600 --> 35:29.733
KNOW I WANT TO DO IT AGAIN.

35:29.733 --> 35:33.133
>> OH.

35:38.433 --> 35:39.667
>> INSPECTED 30 DAYS AGO, MY

35:39.667 --> 35:41.267
ASS.

35:41.267 --> 35:42.367
YOU HAVE A PEN, SO I COULD WRITE

35:42.367 --> 35:44.433
THIS DOWN?

35:44.433 --> 35:46.700
NEVER MIND, I'LL JUST--JUST TAKE

35:46.700 --> 35:48.167
A PICTURE OF IT.

35:48.167 --> 35:49.233

35:49.233 --> 35:50.433
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ELEVATOR OR

35:50.433 --> 35:51.267
WHAT?

35:51.267 --> 35:52.467
>> HMM?

35:52.467 --> 35:54.300
>> I SAID I LOVE YOU.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.067
>> I KNOW.

I THINK YOU ARE SUCH AN AMAZING,

36:01.867 --> 36:03.500
SPECIAL MAN.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.300
I REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY

36:05.300 --> 36:09.067
IT BACK TO YOU, BUT I'M JUST NOT

36:09.067 --> 36:10.667
THERE YET.

36:10.667 --> 36:14.067
NOT SAYING I WON'T EVER BE, JUST

36:14.067 --> 36:15.767
NOT YET.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.400
YEAH, IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE IF

36:44.400 --> 36:47.067
YOU WOULD'VE SAID IT BACK.

36:47.067 --> 36:48.433
BUT I DON'T EVER WANT YOU TO SAY

36:48.433 --> 36:50.600
ANYTHING OUT OF OBLIGATION OR--

36:50.600 --> 36:54.267
OR JUST TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

36:54.267 --> 36:58.367
IT'S BEST TO BE WHERE YOU ARE.

36:58.367 --> 37:01.600

37:01.600 --> 37:04.167
OKAY, I-I UNDERSTAND.

37:04.167 --> 37:05.467
I'M GOOD.

37:05.467 --> 37:06.233
YEAH, I THOUGHT WE'RE ON THE

37:06.233 --> 37:09.167
SAME PAGE, BUT WE'RE NOT.

37:09.167 --> 37:12.100
AND THAT'S FAIR.

37:59.833 --> 38:01.200
BEEN STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR ALL

38:01.200 --> 38:01.933
THIS TIME?

38:01.933 --> 38:03.067
>> LUCKY YOU.

38:03.067 --> 38:03.833
I'VE GOT TO GO.

38:03.833 --> 38:05.500
THANKS FOR THE DRESS.

38:05.500 --> 38:06.167
>> OKAY.

38:06.167 --> 38:07.067
I-I'LL CALL YOU.

38:07.067 --> 38:08.367
>> OKAY.

38:08.367 --> 38:11.300
>> HEY, UM...I GUESS I'LL SEE

38:11.300 --> 38:12.100
YOU THEN.

38:12.100 --> 38:12.900
>> YOU'RE LEAVING?

38:12.900 --> 38:13.800
>> YEAH.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.700
YEAH, UM, I GOT TO GO CHECK ON

38:15.700 --> 38:17.600
MY PLACE AND--WELL, I'LL CALL

38:17.600 --> 38:23.200
YOU LATER.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.833
>> [laughs]

38:25.833 --> 38:29.067
LET'S NOT START THAT AGAIN.

38:29.067 --> 38:30.267
I BETTER GET INSIDE.

38:30.267 --> 38:32.300
>> OKAY.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.833
GOOD-BYE, RAQUEL.

38:42.300 --> 38:44.333
>> SO IT'S A DEAL BREAKER, HUH?

38:44.333 --> 38:46.267
>> YEAH.

38:46.267 --> 38:47.600
A LOT OF WHO I AM IS BEING A

38:47.600 --> 38:49.433
MOTHER, AND I CAN'T SEE MYSELF

38:49.433 --> 38:50.733
GIVING UP THE CHANCE AT THAT

38:50.733 --> 38:53.467
AGAIN FOR ANYONE.

38:53.467 --> 38:54.667
>> SO MAYBE WE'RE NOT GONNA GO

38:54.667 --> 38:56.833
ALL THE WAY.

38:56.833 --> 38:58.767
BUT WE CAN STILL HANG, RIGHT?

38:58.767 --> 38:59.633
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

38:59.633 --> 39:00.967
>> I REALLY LIKE YOU TOO,

39:00.967 --> 39:02.200
JOBARI.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.133
>> I GUESS IT'S GOOD WE TOOK

39:03.133 --> 39:08.500
THINGS SLOW.

39:08.500 --> 39:09.433
>> ONE THING I NEED TO KNOW

39:09.433 --> 39:10.833
THOUGH.

39:10.833 --> 39:11.867
WHAT DID YOU HAVE PLANNED FOR

39:11.867 --> 39:13.267
OUR ONE-MONTH ANNIVERSARY?

39:13.267 --> 39:14.200
>> DON'T DO THAT TO YOURSELF,

39:14.200 --> 39:14.867
GIRL.

39:14.867 --> 39:16.133
YOU MIGHT GIVE UP WANTING MORE

39:16.133 --> 39:17.367
KIDS IF I TOLD YOU.

39:17.367 --> 39:21.900
BUT JUST KNOW IT WAS BANANAS.

39:21.900 --> 39:22.967
>> SO DOES THAT CONCLUDE THE

39:22.967 --> 39:23.967
TALE OF THE SHOP GIRL AND THE

39:23.967 --> 39:24.633
BUS DRIVER?

39:24.633 --> 39:25.567
>> YEAH.

39:25.567 --> 39:27.133
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT A HAPPY

39:27.133 --> 39:28.067
ENDING.

39:28.067 --> 39:29.533
WHY COULDN'T HIS ONE FLAW BE

39:29.533 --> 39:30.833
SOMETHING I COULD GET AROUND,

39:30.833 --> 39:32.667
LIKE HE'S ALLERGIC TO DOGS OR

39:32.667 --> 39:33.333
SOMETHING?

39:33.333 --> 39:34.067
>> HEY.

39:34.067 --> 39:35.767
IN MY WORLD, BEING ALLERGIC TO

39:35.767 --> 39:37.700
DOGS IS A DEAL BREAKER.

39:37.700 --> 39:38.900
PEANUT IS MY BOO.

39:38.900 --> 39:40.333
WE ARE A PACKAGE DEAL.

39:40.333 --> 39:41.167
KEEP HIM AROUND.

39:41.167 --> 39:42.167
YOU MIGHT NEED A BUS PASS ONE

39:42.167 --> 39:42.833
DAY.

39:42.833 --> 39:44.533
I'VE SEEN THAT HOOPTY YOU DRIVE.

39:44.533 --> 39:46.800
[laughs]

39:46.800 --> 39:48.233
TOO SOON?

39:48.233 --> 39:50.233
YEAH, TOO SOON.

39:55.700 --> 39:56.700
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE REGGIE JUST

39:56.700 --> 39:57.367
LEFT.

39:57.367 --> 39:58.433
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL YOU SAID

39:58.433 --> 39:59.900
WAS, "THANK YOU."

39:59.900 --> 40:01.933
>> I KNOW.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.333
BUT WE TALKED ABOUT IT, AND HE'S

40:03.333 --> 40:06.800
COOL AND--WHAT THE HELL IS GOING

40:06.800 --> 40:08.800
ON WITH THOSE TWO?

40:08.800 --> 40:10.367
HOW LONG WAS I STUCK IN THAT

40:10.367 --> 40:11.833
DAMN ELEVATOR?

40:11.833 --> 40:14.100
>> AS OF THIS AFTERNOON, KEISHA

40:14.100 --> 40:16.067
IS ON TEAM SEAN.

40:16.067 --> 40:17.333
>> I GUESS.

40:17.333 --> 40:18.800
>> THAT IS NOT EXACTLY A RINGING

40:18.800 --> 40:19.633
ENDORSEMENT.

40:19.633 --> 40:20.800
>> YOU YOURSELF SAID THIS STUFF

40:20.800 --> 40:22.867
TAKES TIME.

40:22.867 --> 40:26.600
>> OH, IT'S REGGIE.

40:26.600 --> 40:27.767
HE JUST FRIGGIN' BROKE UP WITH

40:27.767 --> 40:28.433
ME.

40:28.433 --> 40:29.100
>> WHAT?

40:29.100 --> 40:30.200
[Aaron Neville's Bring It Home]

40:30.200 --> 40:36.200
>> * A RAINY NIGHT IN GEORGIA

40:36.200 --> 40:38.000
* SAID A RAINY NIGHT

40:38.000 --> 40:40.367
* IN GEORGIA

40:40.367 --> 40:43.633
* OH, IT'S JUST RAINING *

40:43.633 --> 40:46.567
* ALL OVER THE WORLD, BABY

40:49.467 --> 40:50.533
>> NEXT ON SINGLE LADIES...

40:50.533 --> 40:52.267
>> I MISSED A CALL FROM CHARLES.

40:52.267 --> 40:53.733
WE'VE BARELY SPOKEN IN THE PAST

40:53.733 --> 40:54.433
TWO WEEKS.

40:54.433 --> 40:55.733
>> SINCE REGGIE REFUSES TO CALL

40:55.733 --> 40:57.000
ME BACK, I REALLY HAVEN'T HAD A

40:57.000 --> 40:58.233
CHANCE TO EXPRESS MY ANGER.

40:58.233 --> 40:59.567
SO I DECIDED TO WRITE HIM A

40:59.567 --> 41:00.300
LETTER.

41:00.300 --> 41:01.433
>> "YOUR ASS MAKES ME SICK.

41:01.433 --> 41:02.933
YOU'RE A COWARD AND AN ASS.

41:02.933 --> 41:05.133
YOU'RE A COWARDLY ASS COWARD."

41:05.133 --> 41:06.400
>> I WROTE THIS A LONG TIME AGO,

41:06.400 --> 41:07.800
BUT IT REMINDS ME OF A BEAUTIFUL

41:07.800 --> 41:09.067
LADY I JUST MET.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.200
EVERY TIME I LOOK AT HER, I GET

41:10.200 --> 41:12.300
LOST IN THOSE EYES.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.133
>> OH, MY GOD.

41:14.133 --> 41:15.933
MY CAR!

41:15.933 --> 41:18.233
SOMEONE SLASHED MY TIRES.

41:18.233 --> 41:19.800
>> * FEEL SO FREE

41:19.800 --> 41:21.933
* DON'T NEED ANYONE TO KEEP *

41:21.933 --> 41:25.967
>> * MY MIND, MY BODY, MY SOUL

41:25.967 --> 41:30.300
>> * SINGLE

41:30.300 --> 41:32.567
* LADIES
