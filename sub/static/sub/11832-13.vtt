12:30.080 --> 12:32.160
that this doctor go out
and do something in the future.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.220
ROBERTSON:
And that bothered you?

12:33.220 --> 12:35.090
KRAMER: Yes.

12:35.090 --> 12:36.170
- And after you heard
what you believed to be

12:36.170 --> 12:38.080
Mr. Matlin encouraging Dr. Ryan

12:38.080 --> 12:40.040
to go out and tape
an assisted suicide,

12:40.040 --> 12:41.100
what did you do?

12:41.100 --> 12:42.100
- What did I do?

12:42.100 --> 12:43.140
- Yes.

12:43.140 --> 12:45.110
Did you protest to Mr. Matlin?

12:45.110 --> 12:48.150
Did you say anything
to anybody at that time?

12:48.150 --> 12:50.110
- No.

12:50.110 --> 12:53.080
- Well, I guess it didn't bother
you that much, eh, Miss Kramer?

12:53.080 --> 12:54.180
- Objection.
JUDGE: Overruled.

12:54.180 --> 12:56.130
ROBERTSON: After hearing
what you believed

12:56.130 --> 12:58.030
to be somebody
encouraging a suicide,

12:58.030 --> 12:59.220
you just sit tight.

12:59.220 --> 13:01.110
Is that the honorable thing
to do?

13:01.110 --> 13:03.190
- Objection.
- All right, Mr. Robertson.

13:03.190 --> 13:05.020
- Isn't it true
that it was only

13:05.020 --> 13:06.200
after the negative
public response

13:06.200 --> 13:09.170
to this broadcast
that you seized the opportunity

13:09.170 --> 13:11.030
to go after my client?

13:11.030 --> 13:12.090
- That is not true.

13:12.090 --> 13:14.110
- You like John Matlin,
Miss Kramer?

13:14.110 --> 13:16.220
- We've had our differences.
- Ever try to get him fired?

13:16.220 --> 13:18.220
HELEN: Objection.
JUDGE: Overruled.

13:18.220 --> 13:21.120
- Did you ever try
to take his job, Miss Kramer?

13:21.120 --> 13:23.060
- Our differences
were professional.

13:23.060 --> 13:25.100
It has nothing to do with me
sitting in this chair today.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.060
- No, of course not, because you
are an honorable person.

13:27.060 --> 13:28.160
- Objection.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.090
- This is just political,
isn't it?

13:30.090 --> 13:32.020
Or should I direct that question
to the district attorney?

13:32.020 --> 13:34.200
- Objection!
JUDGE: Sustained.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.150
- And after Dr. Ryan
came back with the tape,

13:38.150 --> 13:40.080
having committed
this terrible crime

13:40.080 --> 13:42.050
that you think
your boss motivated,

13:42.050 --> 13:43.200
did you resign?

13:43.200 --> 13:45.070
- No.

13:45.070 --> 13:47.090
ROBERTSON: You're still
with the company?

13:47.090 --> 13:50.050
- Yes.

13:50.050 --> 13:54.060
- Gee whiz.

13:54.060 --> 13:56.130
Nothing further.

14:06.140 --> 14:08.150
- You're calling the doctor?
- I have to.

14:08.150 --> 14:10.150
- This case will be tough enough
without relying

14:10.150 --> 14:12.060
on a hostile witness,
don't you think?

14:12.060 --> 14:13.230
- I have to establish
that a crime was committed.

14:13.230 --> 14:15.140
Otherwise,
I can't make accessory.

14:15.140 --> 14:17.010
- But why should
the doctor help?

14:17.010 --> 14:18.230
He goes on trial himself
next month.

14:18.230 --> 14:20.190
- He doesn't care if he gets
convicted; he's a martyr.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.030
- Helen, he's a hostile witness

14:22.030 --> 14:23.200
who could destroy
your whole case.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.210
- Let him try.

14:25.210 --> 14:28.060
- What is with you?

14:28.060 --> 14:30.040
- I heard that.

Six years I've been
riding this elevator.

14:44.200 --> 14:48.030
I don't think I've ever
been on it with you.

14:48.030 --> 14:52.000
Make one lousy confession.

14:53.030 --> 14:55.140
- Well, it's--

14:55.140 --> 14:57.230
- I do apologize.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.040
- It wasn't something
you could avoid.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.000
- Well, isn't that
a vain take on it.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.140
- I didn't mean it that way.

15:04.140 --> 15:07.040
I meant it was--
it was a dream.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.090
Not something
you did consciously.

15:09.090 --> 15:13.190
- It's just
it was so...

15:31.010 --> 15:32.100

15:32.100 --> 15:34.130
You should also
listen to the music.

15:34.130 --> 15:36.080
It'll help.
- I'm listening.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.040
- It should be noticeable
that you're listening.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.050
- What's going on?
- Dancing lessons.

15:42.050 --> 15:44.030
He wants to learn,
and I figure

15:44.030 --> 15:46.110
it's a good way I can get
some extra time with him.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.220
- That's it, Kendall.

15:47.220 --> 15:49.220
Excellent.

15:56.140 --> 15:59.050
- He did not tell me
to go videotape a death.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.130
HELEN: Why'd you do it?
- Because I chose to, I--

16:01.130 --> 16:03.080
- So it's just a big
coincidence.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.100
The defendant says to you,
"Have you got one on tape,"

16:05.100 --> 16:07.110
and suddenly you choose
to turn on a video recorder.

16:07.110 --> 16:08.210
- Objection.

16:08.210 --> 16:10.160
This is her witness.
- A hostile witness.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.160
- Who nevertheless should be
allowed to finish his answers.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.090
- I agree.

16:15.090 --> 16:17.160
- You were seeking news
coverage, weren't you, Doctor?

16:17.160 --> 16:19.030
- I don't deny that.

16:19.030 --> 16:20.220
But it certainly played
no part in my decision

16:20.220 --> 16:23.090
to participate
in euthanizing Mrs. Burlington.

16:23.090 --> 16:26.090
And I take extreme offense
at your suggestion.

16:26.090 --> 16:28.010
- The issue of euthanasia,

16:28.010 --> 16:30.000
you feel strongly about this,
don't you, Doctor?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.090
RYAN: Yes, I do.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.160
HELEN: You're passionate
about this.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.060
- Well--
- Do you do anything else?

16:34.060 --> 16:35.170
Do you treat patients
as a physician

16:35.170 --> 16:39.120
other than to help them die?

16:39.120 --> 16:42.050
You're passionate about this.
- Yes.

16:42.050 --> 16:44.100
- In fact,
a segment on "Timeline"

16:44.100 --> 16:46.170
would be huge exposure for you
and this issue, wouldn't it?

16:46.170 --> 16:48.080
- That's not why--

16:48.080 --> 16:49.220
- The question is,
would a segment on "Timeline"

16:49.220 --> 16:51.120
be great exposure,
yes or no?

16:51.120 --> 16:52.230
- Of course.

16:52.230 --> 16:54.150
- Do you think your passion
for this cause

16:57.230 --> 16:59.120
- Objection.
RYAN: No.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.060
It was her decision,
Miss Gamble.

17:01.060 --> 17:03.220
The tape clearly reflected that.

17:03.220 --> 17:06.089
HELEN: Don't you think patients
are influenced by their doctors?

17:06.089 --> 17:08.020
- I will tell you,
in this situation,

17:08.020 --> 17:09.210
like every situation,

17:09.210 --> 17:12.030
the patient was
of sound mind and free will

17:12.030 --> 17:15.160
when she decided that she wanted
to end her suffering.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.079
- She was of sound mind?
RYAN: Yes.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.130
- You think suffering people
are of sound mind?

Ever known pain to compromise
a person's judgment, Doctor?

JUDGE: Overruled.

JUDGE: Miss Gamble.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.220
HELEN: How long had you been
treating Mrs. Burlington?

17:43.220 --> 17:45.060
- Not too long.
- More than a year?

17:45.060 --> 17:46.100
- No.
- A month?

17:46.100 --> 17:47.170
- A few weeks.
- A few weeks.

17:47.170 --> 17:49.100
Can you say you truly
knew this woman?

her decision.

17:51.030 --> 17:52.170
HELEN: Doctor,
don't you think

17:52.170 --> 17:54.120
you should at least
know the person

before you inject them
with a fatal drug?

HELEN: If there was a cure
for Mrs. Burlington,

17:59.180 --> 18:01.110
do you think
she would've wanted to die?

18:01.110 --> 18:03.180
- Probably not.
But there was no cure. She was--

18:03.180 --> 18:05.040
- How many doctors
did you talk to

18:05.040 --> 18:07.070
before concluding
there was no cure?

18:07.070 --> 18:09.180
- ALS has no--
- Did you call Johns Hopkins?

18:09.180 --> 18:11.200
UCLA? The Mayo Clinic?

18:11.200 --> 18:14.090
Did you do any research
as to whether a cure

18:14.090 --> 18:15.230
or any experimental drugs

18:15.230 --> 18:17.140
would be viable
within a week,

18:17.140 --> 18:19.070
a month, two months?

18:19.070 --> 18:22.080
- It's my understanding
there is no such cure or drug.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.050
- It's your understanding,
Doctor.

18:24.050 --> 18:26.230
Don't you think you should
make absolutely sure

18:26.230 --> 18:28.180

18:28.180 --> 18:30.170
ROBERTSON: Objection.
This man is not on trial here.

18:30.170 --> 18:33.220
- She wasn't even in the final
stages of ALS, was she?

18:33.220 --> 18:34.220
She could still talk.

18:34.220 --> 18:36.150
- She was suffering.

18:36.150 --> 18:38.220
- Do you have any experience
with direct patient care?

18:38.220 --> 18:39.220
- No, but--

18:39.220 --> 18:40.230
- And you have no expertise

18:40.230 --> 18:42.030
with pain management, do you?

18:42.030 --> 18:43.160
You just kill people.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.030
ROBERTSON: Objection.
JUDGE: Miss Gamble!

18:45.030 --> 18:46.110
- That's why
you'll be prosecuted

18:46.110 --> 18:47.180
next month for murder.

18:47.180 --> 18:49.180
- Objection!
- Sustained!

18:49.180 --> 18:53.020
Miss Gamble,
you're getting off track.

18:53.020 --> 18:54.090
- Way off track.

18:54.090 --> 18:55.210
You lost sight
of the track, Helen.

18:55.210 --> 18:58.070
- I really appreciate
the support, Lindsay.

18:58.070 --> 19:01.060
- Helen, I'm not here
to beat you up.

19:01.060 --> 19:03.070
Whatever your feelings
for the doctor, this case

19:03.070 --> 19:06.020
is about whether that news show
aided and abetted a murderer.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.200
It's Matlin's
state of mind that counts.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.160
Convincing the jury
that Dr. Jekyll in there is evil

19:10.160 --> 19:12.210
won't buy a conviction
against Matlin in this trial.

19:12.210 --> 19:17.200
And for you to be
losing sight of that...

19:17.200 --> 19:20.010
this is about your grandmother,

19:20.010 --> 19:22.120
about you hating doctors
for pulling the plug on her.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.080
- I agreed to pull that plug.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.080
- You didn't do anything.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.080
You were 17.

19:28.080 --> 19:31.080
This isn't something you should
be playing out in that room.

19:31.080 --> 19:35.180
- The defendant
encouraged a murder.

19:35.180 --> 19:38.230
- Then keep it
about the defendant.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.070
BOBBY: It's irrelevant.

19:44.070 --> 19:46.020
- That's for a jury to decide.
- It is not, Jean.

19:46.020 --> 19:48.020
Relevancy is a bench call.
The jury--

19:48.020 --> 19:50.220
- Then how about letting
the bench make the call?

19:50.220 --> 19:52.010
I'll take it to bene.

19:52.010 --> 19:53.070
If I think it's pertinent--

19:53.070 --> 19:54.080
BOBBY: Your Honor,
whether or not

19:54.080 --> 19:55.100
he had a valid gun permit,

19:55.100 --> 19:56.200
it doesn't make any difference.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.150
- Then why are you so concerned?

19:58.150 --> 20:00.000
- Because she's putting it in

20:00.000 --> 20:01.200
to make my client
look like a bad guy.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.090
- I'm putting it in to show
your guy has a thing about guns.

20:03.090 --> 20:05.040
- Oh, please.
- I'll admit it to bene.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.210
If I think it's prejudicial,
I'll strike it later.

20:07.210 --> 20:12.190
It's not a bell with much
of a ding, Counsel.

20:12.190 --> 20:15.050
Let's go back in.

20:15.050 --> 20:19.060
- It's irrelevant,
and you know it.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.130
- I think I am going
to recuse myself.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.110
I keep thinking about you.

20:34.110 --> 20:36.130
You know what it probably is?

20:36.130 --> 20:38.150
It's that stupid cologne
you're wearing.

20:38.150 --> 20:40.110
My husband wore that.

20:40.110 --> 20:43.200
We even buried him in it.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.190
Maybe I'm having
a midlife crisis.

20:45.190 --> 20:47.170
Anyway...

20:47.170 --> 20:50.080
- Well, it'll probably
be a mistrial.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.200
- Yes, I know.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.160
I'm sorry.

20:53.160 --> 20:56.030
- Well, what reason will you
give a mistrial at this point?

20:56.030 --> 20:57.060
It'll be on the record.

20:57.060 --> 21:01.140
- I don't know.

21:01.140 --> 21:05.170
Maybe I'll say
I've taken ill.

21:05.170 --> 21:08.070
Oh, what a mess.

21:08.070 --> 21:10.190
You know what Zoey said to me?

21:10.190 --> 21:13.040
She said, "Roberta, your heart

21:13.040 --> 21:15.180
would never
go anywhere uninvited."

21:15.180 --> 21:17.110
And then she said,

21:17.110 --> 21:20.210
"Are you sure he doesn't have
a little crush on you?"

21:20.210 --> 21:24.110
That's not the case, is it?

21:24.110 --> 21:28.220
- Well--
- I don't mean to embarrass you.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.170
What, is it--
is it so totally nuts,

21:30.170 --> 21:31.170
you and an older woman?

21:31.170 --> 21:33.080
- No, no.
It--

21:33.080 --> 21:34.110
- You can be honest.

21:34.110 --> 21:36.120
I'm recusing myself.

21:36.120 --> 21:40.040
Have you ever fantasized
about an older woman?

21:40.040 --> 21:45.070
- Jacqueline Bisset.
- Jacqueline Bisset.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.150
Hmm.

21:46.150 --> 21:48.140
And not me.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.190
- Well, I mean,
you're the judge.

21:51.190 --> 21:53.080
I--even if I--

21:53.080 --> 21:56.080
I would never...with the judge.

21:56.080 --> 21:59.220
It's probably the robe.

21:59.220 --> 22:03.210
- Yeah.

22:03.210 --> 22:06.160
Well, I'm sorry for...

22:06.160 --> 22:10.040
being human.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.040
We'll be getting
you another judge.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.140
- Okay.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.100
Thanks.

22:37.020 --> 22:38.210
[horns honking]

22:38.210 --> 22:42.200
- The idea that I solicited
that tape is beneath comment.

22:42.200 --> 22:45.080
- And what exactly
did you say to Dr. Ryan?

22:45.080 --> 22:47.160
- I asked him
if he had a videotape,

22:47.160 --> 22:49.010
past tense.

22:49.010 --> 22:51.120
I never directly
nor indirectly

22:51.120 --> 22:53.190
suggested that
he go out and get one.

22:53.190 --> 22:56.070
- Why'd you ask
if he had a tape?

22:56.070 --> 22:58.220
MATLIN: I won't deny
it might have made a difference.

22:58.220 --> 23:01.130
A man has a videotape
of an act of euthanasia,

23:01.130 --> 23:03.110
that's news.

23:03.110 --> 23:05.050
- So it would be fair
for Dr. Ryan

23:05.050 --> 23:08.000
to leave your office
with the idea that a videotape,

23:08.000 --> 23:09.110
that's news?

23:09.110 --> 23:10.130
- Miss Gamble.

23:10.130 --> 23:12.180
A convenience store is held up,

23:12.180 --> 23:14.160
it doesn't get airtime,

23:14.160 --> 23:17.130
but caught on camera,
it leads.

23:17.130 --> 23:20.090
We're a voyeuristic nation.

23:20.090 --> 23:23.100
Are you going to hold me
responsible for that?

23:23.100 --> 23:26.060
- See, the difference is,
the prospect of news coverage

23:26.060 --> 23:28.130
doesn't encourage
7-Eleven robbers;

23:28.130 --> 23:30.050
they're after money.

23:30.050 --> 23:33.130
Here, you offered Dr. Ryan
exactly what he was after.

23:33.130 --> 23:35.230
- That is absolutely false.

23:35.230 --> 23:37.170
HELEN: You knew this man
was on a mission

23:37.170 --> 23:39.030
to legalize euthanasia,

23:39.030 --> 23:41.040
and you sent him
out of your office with the idea

23:41.040 --> 23:43.190
that some videotape
would make a difference.

23:43.190 --> 23:46.170
- I did not say,
"Go out and kill somebody."

23:46.170 --> 23:49.040
- How long before Dr. Ryan
returned with the tape

23:49.040 --> 23:51.060
of Mrs. Burlington's death?

23:51.060 --> 23:52.220
- I think about ten days.

23:52.220 --> 23:54.180
- Ten days.

23:54.180 --> 23:56.040
Let me ask you.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.220
On average,
how long does it take to produce

23:58.220 --> 24:00.180
a typical segment for broadcast,

24:00.180 --> 24:05.010
and by, that I mean research,
writing, shooting, editing?

24:05.010 --> 24:08.070
MATLIN: Pre- and postproduction
take about two months.

24:08.070 --> 24:10.140
Research varies;
it can take about a year.

24:10.140 --> 24:13.200
- When Dr. Ryan returned
to your office with the tape,

24:13.200 --> 24:16.070
how much time elapsed
before it aired?

24:16.070 --> 24:17.200
- This one was short.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.010
- How much time between
the time you got the tape

24:20.010 --> 24:21.130
and the time it aired?

24:21.130 --> 24:24.010
- About a week.
- Do you recall when it aired?

24:24.010 --> 24:27.040
- November.
- November.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.120
Did you tell him
you needed it for sweeps?

24:33.100 --> 24:35.000
[sweeping instrumental music
playing]

24:35.000 --> 24:38.030
LUCY: Good.

24:38.030 --> 24:40.140
Try to avoid my feet if you can.

24:40.140 --> 24:42.100
Watch this, Eugene.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.200
See what a quick study he is.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.080
- Look, Dad.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.110
I'm doing it.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.150
- I can see.

24:49.150 --> 24:53.130
- Um, not so close.
- I like this.

24:53.130 --> 24:55.080
- Okay, Eugene,

24:55.080 --> 24:57.140
why don't you dance with him
so I can see his posture?

24:57.140 --> 24:58.200
- I don't want
to dance with him.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.130
- It will just be for a second.

25:00.130 --> 25:02.090
Kendall, you lead.

25:12.170 --> 25:14.010
- You're terrible.

25:14.010 --> 25:15.150
EUGENE: Let me get warm.

25:15.150 --> 25:18.010
KENDALL: Terrible.

25:18.010 --> 25:21.160
- We're dancing.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.110
- [scoffs]

25:35.030 --> 25:38.140
- Miss Ward,
please call your next witness.

25:38.140 --> 25:40.110
- Your Honor, ex parte sidebar.

25:40.110 --> 25:41.130
JUDGE: Quickly.

25:41.130 --> 25:43.200
- What's going on?

25:48.110 --> 25:50.110
- I thought about it all night,

25:50.110 --> 25:53.220
and I really do feel
I can stay impartial.

25:53.220 --> 25:56.210
In fact, I know I can.

25:56.210 --> 25:58.080
And if you don't mind,

25:58.080 --> 26:00.190
I'd like to spare myself
the embarrassment.

26:00.190 --> 26:04.040
- Your Honor...

26:04.040 --> 26:05.110
- Look.

26:05.110 --> 26:07.100
If you have even
the slightest suspicion

26:07.100 --> 26:10.170
that my work is being
affected by my hormones,

26:10.170 --> 26:12.060
bring a motion for recusal.

26:12.060 --> 26:14.200
I will take myself off.

26:14.200 --> 26:17.000
Is that fair?

26:20.190 --> 26:22.110
- I actually live right
across the street.

26:22.110 --> 26:23.230
- From the defendant.
- Yes.

26:23.230 --> 26:25.080
- And did you ever
see the defendant

26:25.080 --> 26:27.000
and John Marks together?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.140
- Well, sure.
They were neighbors.

26:28.140 --> 26:30.020
- Friendly?
- Yes.

26:30.020 --> 26:31.180
- Mr. Barton,
did you have knowledge

26:31.180 --> 26:33.210
that Mr. Marks was in
the drug-trafficking business?

26:33.210 --> 26:35.050
- Assuming facts
not in evidence.

26:35.050 --> 26:36.120
JUDGE: Sustained.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.010
The jury will
disregard the question.

26:38.010 --> 26:39.070
JEAN: Do you
have reason to know

26:39.070 --> 26:40.190
what Mr. Marks
does for a living?

26:40.190 --> 26:42.020
- He deals drugs.

26:42.020 --> 26:44.050
- How do you know this?
- He told me.

26:44.050 --> 26:45.090
JEAN: And what else
did he tell you?

26:45.090 --> 26:46.200
- Well, I asked him

26:46.200 --> 26:48.100
if he was ever afraid
of getting busted,

26:48.100 --> 26:49.170
and he said sometimes,

26:49.170 --> 26:51.080
but he could always
hide his stuff

26:51.080 --> 26:52.230
at Bob's house
if the police were ever--

26:52.230 --> 26:54.130
- Objection! Hearsay.
Move to strike that.

26:54.130 --> 26:56.000
- Declaration against interest,
Your Honor.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.170
Exception to the hearsay rule.

26:57.170 --> 26:59.000
- What declaration?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.070
- Mr. Marks
said this in a context

27:00.070 --> 27:01.200
while admitting
he was a drug dealer.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.100
Now, that's either an admission,

27:03.100 --> 27:05.090
or it's a declaration
against interest.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.010
In either case--

27:07.010 --> 27:09.010
- That statement is
so prejudicial and unreliable.

27:09.010 --> 27:10.130
- I'm overruling the objection.

27:10.130 --> 27:12.200
- Your Honor--
- The objection is overruled.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.120
Sit down, Counsel.

27:21.100 --> 27:24.050
- My mother wanted to die.

27:24.050 --> 27:25.170
She was in pain.

27:25.170 --> 27:27.130
She didn't want to be a burden.

27:27.130 --> 27:29.210
She made the decision to die.

27:29.210 --> 27:33.220
- Mr. Burlington, you've heard
the prosecution's suggestion

27:33.220 --> 27:35.230
that your mother
may have died as a result

27:35.230 --> 27:38.010
of this television broadcast.

27:38.010 --> 27:40.090
- It's not only ridiculous;
it's offensive.

27:40.090 --> 27:43.020
It trivializes her
and her decision,

27:43.020 --> 27:47.130
and I find this whole trial
to be repugnant.

27:47.130 --> 27:49.070
- By your own statement,
you said your mother

27:49.070 --> 27:51.010
went back and forth on this,
didn't she?

27:51.010 --> 27:53.170
- Yes,
but she was clear in the end.

27:53.170 --> 27:55.030
- She was clear in the end,

27:55.030 --> 27:57.140
but do you make room
for the possibility

27:57.140 --> 27:59.130
that after she talked
to Dr. Ryan,

27:59.130 --> 28:02.100
that first meeting,
she became more clear?

28:02.100 --> 28:04.040
- I don't know.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.170
HELEN: Well, did she have
any fear of being euthanized?

28:06.170 --> 28:08.170
- She had concerns of pain.

28:08.170 --> 28:11.070
Her biggest was,
what if it doesn't work

28:11.070 --> 28:13.010
and she ends up comatose?

28:13.010 --> 28:15.030
- So it would be fair to say
that he had some influence?

28:15.030 --> 28:16.180
- Your Honor, I have to object.

28:16.180 --> 28:18.170
Dr. Ryan is not on trial here.

28:18.170 --> 28:20.120
- I'm establishing
that Mr. Matlin's

28:20.120 --> 28:22.030
influence on the doctor

28:22.030 --> 28:24.180
resulted in the doctor
influencing the patient.

28:24.180 --> 28:27.050
- All right.

28:27.050 --> 28:30.040
- She was more certain
of what she wanted to do

28:30.040 --> 28:33.100
after talking to Dr. Ryan,
yes or no?

28:33.100 --> 28:35.100
- Yes.

28:35.100 --> 28:37.070
- Thank you.

28:48.050 --> 28:49.120
- What do you mean
she hit on you?

28:49.120 --> 28:50.210
- Well, she--

28:50.210 --> 28:52.080
- While she's the judge
on your case?

28:52.080 --> 28:53.180
- She was going
to recuse herself,

28:53.180 --> 28:55.120
and then she thought
it would have no effect.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.050
- Bobby.

28:57.050 --> 28:58.120
- Well, I don't think
it'll have any effect.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.150
- What exactly did she say?

28:59.150 --> 29:01.030
- Listen, it's not important.

29:01.030 --> 29:04.180
- I just want to know
exactly what she said.

29:04.180 --> 29:06.190
- It started with
that she had some kind

29:06.190 --> 29:11.100
of erotic dream about me,
and then--I don't know--

29:11.100 --> 29:12.170
she couldn't stop
thinking about me.

29:12.170 --> 29:14.150
- And she's still on this case?

29:14.150 --> 29:16.080
- Lindsay--
- Does this just happen?

29:16.080 --> 29:17.170
Women come up to you
and tell you

29:17.170 --> 29:19.080
that you're in their dreams?

29:19.080 --> 29:21.070
- Can you guys keep it down?

29:21.070 --> 29:23.040
- She didn't have to tell me.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.150
I mean, she wasn't
admitting any bias.

29:25.150 --> 29:29.030
- Bobby, how can this woman
be the judge on your case?

29:29.030 --> 29:30.230
- Lindsay, I keep talking
to you as a colleague,

29:30.230 --> 29:33.170
and you keep coming back
at me as a girlfriend.

29:33.170 --> 29:35.100
- Well, I--
I've got problems as a colleague

29:35.100 --> 29:37.060
and a girlfriend,
I mean, how did that--

29:37.060 --> 29:39.000
- Oh, I'm sorry I brought it up.
Just forget about it all right?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.020
Just forget about it.
- Hey, can you shut up?

29:41.020 --> 29:43.030
I'm trying to do a closing!
Go scream somewhere else!

29:43.030 --> 29:45.090
The hell is wrong with you?

29:45.090 --> 29:47.000
[door slams]
- Is she okay?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.190
- No.

29:51.010 --> 29:52.210
- [groans]

29:56.070 --> 29:59.130
- Am I from another planet?

29:59.130 --> 30:04.000
The news, the press,
they say I'm nuts to prosecute.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.160
My own boss.

30:05.160 --> 30:07.040
What am I missing?

30:07.040 --> 30:09.230
Wasn't this the equivalent
of a hired hit?

30:09.230 --> 30:11.120
- A hired hit?

30:11.120 --> 30:13.080
Helen, you don't really
believe the defendant

30:13.080 --> 30:15.040
wanted somebody
to get killed, do you?

30:15.040 --> 30:16.180
- What did he think he would do,
Lindsay?

30:16.180 --> 30:18.020
He was reckless.

30:18.020 --> 30:19.190
He knew this wacko doctor

30:19.190 --> 30:22.000
would do anything
to get on the news.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.020
- So maybe they were stupid

30:23.020 --> 30:24.120
or negligent.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.200
But an accessory to murder?

30:26.200 --> 30:29.050
- These people don't know
their influence, Lindsay.

30:29.050 --> 30:31.080
Not the news producers,
not the doctors.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.090
They don't realize.

30:33.090 --> 30:35.150
Maybe if some DA had the guts

30:35.150 --> 30:38.030
to go after one
of these doctors, then maybe--

30:38.030 --> 30:39.200
- Maybe what?

30:39.200 --> 30:42.100
The doctor who upped
your grandmother's morphine drip

30:42.100 --> 30:44.070
would've thought twice?

30:49.040 --> 30:51.190
- Old people,
they're impressionable,

30:51.190 --> 30:54.050
especially when they're sick

30:54.050 --> 30:55.230
and when they hurt,

30:55.230 --> 30:58.130
and when a doctor says,

30:58.130 --> 31:03.020
"Hey, it's okay to die"...

31:03.020 --> 31:07.110
- Helen, at some point,
you have to let go of this.

31:14.130 --> 31:16.090
- She looked at me.

31:16.090 --> 31:19.140
She said, "It's right;
it's time to leave,"

31:19.140 --> 31:21.210
but there was something
in her eyes.

31:21.210 --> 31:25.230
Something said,
"Tell me otherwise."

31:25.230 --> 31:28.030
- You were a teenager.

31:28.030 --> 31:30.020
Your mother, your father,
your aunts and uncles,

31:30.020 --> 31:32.040
there were a lot
of people she talked to.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.130
- But I'm the only one
who really knew that...

31:34.130 --> 31:37.010
she didn't want
to be a burden.

31:37.010 --> 31:38.230
She thought it was
her duty to die,

31:38.230 --> 31:41.150
and these doctors,

31:41.150 --> 31:44.110
they make it okay to die.

31:44.110 --> 31:48.050
And then...

31:48.050 --> 31:52.170
old people somehow begin
to think it's their duty.

31:57.100 --> 31:59.010
- Whether that's true or not,

31:59.010 --> 32:02.090
that isn't this case.

32:02.090 --> 32:04.020
You've got to go
in there tomorrow

32:04.020 --> 32:06.070
and do a closing on this case.

32:06.070 --> 32:09.200
It isn't about your grandmother,
and it isn't about that doctor.

32:09.200 --> 32:14.080
Helen, you're prosecuting
a news magazine for murder.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.080
Do you get that?

32:30.230 --> 32:32.130
- I never offered to hide
his drugs for him.

32:32.130 --> 32:34.170
That's just a flat-out
fabrication.

32:34.170 --> 32:38.050
BOBBY: Mr. Harmon, the question
on everybody's minds:

32:38.050 --> 32:40.220
why did you
start shooting that night?

32:40.220 --> 32:43.230
- First, I didn't know
they were police officers.

32:43.230 --> 32:45.090
I just heard noise.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.120
As soon as the door came open,

32:46.120 --> 32:48.000
I saw a gun.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.120
I grabbed for mine.

32:49.120 --> 32:52.100
- And opened fire.

32:52.100 --> 32:55.140
- Living next door
to Mark's,

32:55.140 --> 32:57.190
I did know
how he made his money.

32:57.190 --> 33:00.150
I knew the kind of people
that came calling over there.

33:00.150 --> 33:03.020
It made me nervous.
I have a family.

33:03.020 --> 33:05.170
And when I heard yelling
and doors being kicked down,

33:05.170 --> 33:08.000
I thought,
"Oh, God, what's happening?"

33:08.000 --> 33:11.020
And as I said,
as soon as I saw the gun,

33:11.020 --> 33:14.020
I just...

33:14.020 --> 33:17.120
better them than me.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.130
- You have a permit for the gun?

33:19.130 --> 33:22.200
- No, I would never be able
to get one to carry.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.090
And in that neighborhood,
I wanted to carry.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.030
- And when you saw
the police uniforms, what?

33:27.030 --> 33:28.220
You thought they looked fake?

33:28.220 --> 33:31.030
HARMON: I started shooting
before I saw uniforms.

33:31.030 --> 33:32.030
I was afraid.

33:32.030 --> 33:33.140
- You ever have occasion

33:33.140 --> 33:35.050
to shoot somebody else before,
Mr. Harmon?

33:35.050 --> 33:36.180
- Objection.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.220
JEAN: Did you shoot
at a man walking his dog?

33:37.220 --> 33:39.060
- Objection!
JEAN: Pattern.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.150
BOBBY: Prior bad acts.
JEAN: Pattern!

33:40.150 --> 33:42.140
- Counsel!

33:42.140 --> 33:46.000
Approach.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.040
- Two years ago,
he shot at a man

33:48.040 --> 33:50.000
he claimed he thought
was a prowler.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.210
- Oh, come on.
That's completely inadmissible.

33:51.210 --> 33:53.150
- This man shoots first,
claims fear later--

33:53.150 --> 33:55.210
- I'm not going
to allow it, Counsel.

33:55.210 --> 33:57.200
- Your Honor, I'd ask
that you declare a mistrial.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.160
There's no point--
- You're not gonna get that.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.020
- The jury heard that.

34:01.020 --> 34:02.160
JUDGE: And I will give them
an instruction,

34:02.160 --> 34:04.110
but we're not calling
any mistrial.

34:04.110 --> 34:07.020
- It's a legitimate
cause for a mistrial,

34:07.020 --> 34:09.030
Your Honor.

34:09.030 --> 34:12.000
- I've made my ruling.

34:16.170 --> 34:18.020
- Timothy McVeigh
made the covers

34:18.020 --> 34:21.040
of "TIME" and "Newsweek"
seven times.

34:21.040 --> 34:23.060
Jeffrey Dahmer,
that serial killer

34:23.060 --> 34:25.170
that ate his victims,
he made it too.

34:25.170 --> 34:28.080
Did they commit
their crimes for fame?

34:28.080 --> 34:30.190
Well, I seriously doubt it,

34:30.190 --> 34:32.190
but there are a lot
of sick people out there

34:32.190 --> 34:34.090
looking to be noticed,

34:34.090 --> 34:36.080
hoping to matter.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.090
Well, what about that guy
that says to himself,

34:39.090 --> 34:42.120
"Timothy McVeigh got famous;
so can I"?

34:42.120 --> 34:44.070
Should we hold "TIME"
and "Newsweek"

34:44.070 --> 34:47.030
liable for his crimes?

34:47.030 --> 34:49.010
The gang member in LA,

34:49.010 --> 34:51.210
he's sure to be in front
of the television at 11:00

34:51.210 --> 34:53.179
to see if he made the news.

34:53.179 --> 34:58.010
Everybody wants their 15 minutes
being on TV.

34:58.010 --> 35:00.010
It's almost as good as a reward.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.160
Should we start holding
the news companies liable

35:02.160 --> 35:04.190
for the gang member's crime?

35:04.190 --> 35:07.060
I suppose we could.

35:07.060 --> 35:09.160
The whole point with terrorism
is to make a statement.

35:09.160 --> 35:12.010
Without the news,
there's no effect.

35:12.010 --> 35:15.160
Surely, if we outlawed
the coverage

35:15.160 --> 35:19.150
of terrorist attacks,
terrorism would go down.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.220
Well, why don't we, then?

35:21.220 --> 35:23.080
And why stop there?

35:23.080 --> 35:25.030
We could kill all the stories

35:25.030 --> 35:27.140
that lead to copycat crimes.

35:27.140 --> 35:28.210
The Pentagon, I'm sure

35:28.210 --> 35:30.050
that they would jump
at the chance

35:30.050 --> 35:32.060
to squash certain reports

35:32.060 --> 35:34.220
in the interest
of national security.

35:34.220 --> 35:37.150
You want to go down that road?

35:37.150 --> 35:40.090
Because you can.

35:40.090 --> 35:42.160
We can start legislating
the news business

35:42.160 --> 35:45.020
like any other.

35:45.020 --> 35:47.120
Decide what you should hear

35:47.120 --> 35:50.000
and what you shouldn't.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.230
You want to go down that road?

35:52.230 --> 35:57.010
Clearly, the prosecution does.

36:08.100 --> 36:12.050
- If a network news executive
said to a terrorist,

36:12.050 --> 36:14.060
"Get one on tape
and we'll lead with it,"

36:14.060 --> 36:17.040
we would absolutely
prosecute the executive.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.230
Trust me.

36:18.230 --> 36:21.160
Dr. Ryan left
John Matlin's office

36:21.160 --> 36:23.090
with a message:

36:23.090 --> 36:26.120
videotape one,
you get your profile.

36:26.120 --> 36:28.120
That's encouragement.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.110
By their own admission,

36:30.110 --> 36:33.160
they knew this doctor was on
a quest to promote euthanasia.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.210
This doctor's a zealot,
willing to be arrested,

36:36.210 --> 36:39.010
willing to spend
his entire life in jail,

36:39.010 --> 36:41.060
anything for the cause.

36:41.060 --> 36:43.000
And what do they do?

36:43.000 --> 36:46.010
They hold out a carrot for him
to commit the crime again.

36:46.010 --> 36:49.010
Incentive equals encouragement.

36:49.010 --> 36:52.020
Would Dr. Ryan
have killed her anyway?

36:52.020 --> 36:54.170
Maybe. Maybe not.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.170
It doesn't matter.

36:55.170 --> 36:57.170
As the judge will instruct you,

36:57.170 --> 36:59.130
we don't have to prove

36:59.130 --> 37:02.130
but for the defendant's actions,
there would have been no crime.

37:02.130 --> 37:05.180
All we have to show
is that it was possible

37:05.180 --> 37:08.190
that this encouragement
could've been effective.

37:08.190 --> 37:10.160
And of course it could've.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.210
And this doctor certainly got
what he wanted, didn't he?

37:13.210 --> 37:15.190
Mary Burlington is dead,

37:15.190 --> 37:19.140
and Dr. Ryan got on for sweeps.

37:19.140 --> 37:22.060
Freedom of the press
is not absolute,

37:22.060 --> 37:23.200
ladies and gentlemen.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.110
And freedom of speech

37:25.110 --> 37:28.170
doesn't give you the right
to facilitate a murder.

37:28.170 --> 37:31.010
And believe it or not,

37:31.010 --> 37:34.000
winning your time slot
doesn't get you off.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.070
We all sit back and say,

37:35.070 --> 37:38.100
"Look what journalism
has become."

37:38.100 --> 37:41.130
You have two choices.

37:41.130 --> 37:43.150
Go back to that room

37:43.150 --> 37:47.060
and continue to sit back,

37:47.060 --> 37:49.200
or don't.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.050
- Aggravated assault?

38:04.050 --> 38:05.180
- There's no way
we can't jump at it.

38:05.180 --> 38:07.090
Those were police officers.

38:07.090 --> 38:10.050
- But--but I panicked.
- Robert, you shot a detective.

38:10.050 --> 38:12.230
Add to that the statement
that you hide the guy's stash--

38:12.230 --> 38:15.220
- I never.
- But it's in evidence.

38:15.220 --> 38:18.160
And the jury heard about you
shooting the dog walker.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.190
Listen,

38:20.190 --> 38:25.000
I've been
doing this a long time.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.130
We should take
the aggravated assault.

38:27.130 --> 38:29.070
The only reason
it's being offered

38:29.070 --> 38:32.220
is because the DA is convinced
she'll never beat us,

38:32.220 --> 38:35.140
but she's wrong.

38:35.140 --> 38:39.190
She'll win this.

38:39.190 --> 38:41.130
- Are you sure?

38:41.130 --> 38:43.100
- Positive.

38:47.220 --> 38:49.130
- Okay.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.200
- You didn't tell him?

38:53.200 --> 38:57.150
- No. Should I?
I don't think.

38:57.150 --> 39:00.150
None of her rulings
were clearly in error.

39:00.150 --> 39:02.060
- But they all went against you.
- Not all.

39:02.060 --> 39:03.210
She shut down
the dog walker incident.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.180
She didn't let it come
into evidence.

39:05.180 --> 39:07.110
- Yeah, but like you said,
the jury heard it.

39:07.110 --> 39:09.020
And she wouldn't give you
the mistrial.

39:09.020 --> 39:10.160
- Oh, what judge
would call a mistrial

39:10.160 --> 39:11.190
at this point in the trial?

39:11.190 --> 39:13.050
- So you've got nothing concrete

39:13.050 --> 39:14.190
that she's doing
anything wrong, well,

39:14.190 --> 39:16.080
aside from hitting on you?

39:16.080 --> 39:17.130
- Right.

39:17.130 --> 39:20.100
- But you can't be sure.
- Right.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.110

by not getting her recused

39:22.110 --> 39:24.070

39:24.070 --> 39:26.030
- I didn't want to embarrass
her; she's a good judge.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.110
- If this were me
and a male judge--

39:27.110 --> 39:28.130

a little too much.

39:46.230 --> 39:48.190

39:55.100 --> 39:59.110

You expected me to go your way

42:25.050 --> 42:26.220
JUDGE: Order.

42:26.220 --> 42:29.100
Order!

42:29.100 --> 42:30.200
- Your Honor.

42:30.200 --> 42:32.060
Your Honor, the defense

42:32.060 --> 42:34.190
asks that the judge
set this verdict aside.

42:34.190 --> 42:36.050
- Denied.

42:36.050 --> 42:39.220
Bailiff,
take the defendant into custody.

42:39.220 --> 42:42.080
The jury is dismissed,
with the thanks of the Court.

42:42.080 --> 42:43.160
We're adjourned.

43:04.030 --> 43:06.120
- Helen?

43:16.030 --> 43:20.130
- Well, they think about
two weeks for the Boucher trial.

43:20.130 --> 43:24.010
No, manslaughter.

43:24.010 --> 43:25.120
Well, it's pretty
straight ahead,

43:25.120 --> 43:27.110
but there's a lot on forensics,

43:27.110 --> 43:29.080
so who knows?

43:33.220 --> 43:36.090
Yeah.

43:36.090 --> 43:39.200
No, that'd be all right.

43:39.200 --> 43:43.010
We'll put it on the calendar,
then.

43:43.010 --> 43:46.160
Really?

43:46.160 --> 43:51.050
No. I don't think so.

43:51.050 --> 43:53.060
Okay, yeah.

43:53.060 --> 43:54.180
Bye-bye.
