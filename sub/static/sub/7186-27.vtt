01:04.665 --> 01:08.634
Do you wanna join
my pirate crew?

01:08.636 --> 01:11.470
Great!
To start today's adventure,

01:11.472 --> 01:13.672
everybody say
the pirate password...

01:13.674 --> 01:15.741
Yo-ho-ho!

01:15.743 --> 01:17.609
[all]
Yo-ho-ho!

01:17.611 --> 01:19.278
One more time.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.380
Yo-ho-ho!

01:28.822 --> 01:31.023
[Hook]
Ahh, this rosy rose

01:31.025 --> 01:34.059
shall surely win
Red Jessica's heart.

01:34.061 --> 01:37.096
Now, Captain,
she does know you're coming

01:37.098 --> 01:38.664
for a visit, right?

01:38.666 --> 01:40.199
No, but who wouldn't want

01:40.201 --> 01:43.502
to get a surprise visit
from Captain Hook?

01:43.504 --> 01:46.205
Well, haul me keel.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.874
If it isn't
Captain James Hook.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.443
I hope you don't mind,
milady,

01:51.445 --> 01:53.879
but I was in
the Never Sea neighborhood

01:53.881 --> 01:56.882
and thought I'd stop by.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.650
Come on in, James.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.954
Beatrice and I were about
to have a spot of tea.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.088
Beatrice.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.691
Le Beak!

02:05.693 --> 02:09.528
Ah, <i>mon capitaine,</i>
<i>for me?</i>

02:09.530 --> 02:11.563
You shouldn't have.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.699
You two know each other.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.534
Oh, I know Le Beak.

02:15.536 --> 02:19.605
She's a lowdown, no-good
sneaky thief.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.840
<i>¶ There's no bigger sneak </i>

02:21.842 --> 02:24.076
<i>¶ Than Beatrice Le Beak </i>

02:24.078 --> 02:26.245
<i>¶ If she wants</i>
<i>your treasure ¶</i>

02:26.247 --> 02:28.180
<i>¶ It's gone in a wink </i>

02:28.182 --> 02:29.748
<i>¶ She'll creep</i>
<i>and she'll sleek ¶</i>

02:29.750 --> 02:31.917
<i>¶ And before</i>
<i>you can think ¶</i>

02:31.919 --> 02:34.052
<i>¶ You have just</i>
<i>been Le Beaked ¶</i>

02:34.054 --> 02:38.490
<i>¶ By the sneakiest</i>
<i>of sneaky sneaks ¶</i>

02:38.492 --> 02:43.095
<i>¶ En garde,</i>
<i>le sneaky Le Beak ¶</i>

02:43.097 --> 02:47.266
Oh, James, Beatrice isn't
a plundering pirate.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.501
She's me new pirate pal.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.171
Come. I'm about
to show Beatrice
me treasured art collection,

02:52.173 --> 02:56.141
including me new
Ruby Pearl necklace.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.877
Oh, <i>très magnifique.</i>

02:58.879 --> 03:02.014
It is marvelous.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.515
See here, Le Beak.

03:03.517 --> 03:07.186
I'm going to be watching
every single move you make.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.521
Then you will be
watching me getting away

03:09.523 --> 03:13.225
with Red Jessica's
treasured art collection.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.696
[shouting]

03:20.500 --> 03:23.068
<i>Au revoir.</i> Bye-bye.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.604
Oh. Did James
leave already

03:25.606 --> 03:27.439
without saying goodbye?

03:27.441 --> 03:31.443
Mon capitaine is <i>escargot.</i>

03:31.445 --> 03:34.947
- Whoa! Smee!
- [shouting]

03:37.317 --> 03:38.617
Whew!

03:38.619 --> 03:41.286
We have to save Red Jessica
from the clutches

03:41.288 --> 03:43.689
of that rotten Le Beak.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.425
But how, Smee? How?

03:46.427 --> 03:48.694
[Jake]
Ahoy, Captain Hook!

03:48.696 --> 03:51.096
We were sailing by when
we saw you tumble out

03:51.098 --> 03:53.198
of Red Jessica's castle.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.801
That sneaky Le Beak
is back.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.936
And she's trying
to trick Red Jessica

03:57.938 --> 04:01.506
so she can swipe
her art collection.

04:01.508 --> 04:04.743
Yay-hey, no way.
Sounds like trouble.

04:04.745 --> 04:08.247
Captain, why don't we work
together to help Red Jessica?

04:08.249 --> 04:12.084
[sighs] If we must.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.920
Just do not get in me way.

04:14.922 --> 04:18.523
Mateys, will you help us save
Red Jessica's art collection

04:18.525 --> 04:20.626
from Sneaky Le Beak?

04:22.228 --> 04:25.731
Great! Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

04:25.733 --> 04:29.268
Whenever we solve
a "Pirate Problem" together,
they'll appear.

04:29.270 --> 04:32.838
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our team treasure chest.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.674
Yo-ho, let's go stop
sneaky Le Beak!

04:35.676 --> 04:37.709
Is everybody ready?

04:37.711 --> 04:40.412
- I got my sword.
- I got my map.

04:40.414 --> 04:43.115
And I've got my pixie dust.

04:43.117 --> 04:46.184
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly,

04:46.186 --> 04:48.754
but only in emergencies.

04:48.756 --> 04:52.391
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys aweigh </i>

04:52.393 --> 04:56.428
-  <i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>
<i>- Let's go!</i>

04:56.430 --> 04:59.865
<i>¶ Heave-ho, here we go</i>
<i>together as a team ¶</i>

04:59.867 --> 05:02.668
<i>¶ Jake and the Never Land</i>
<i>Pirates ¶</i>

05:02.670 --> 05:04.569
<i>¶ And me </i>

05:06.873 --> 05:10.942
Thank you for taking such
an interest in me art
collection, Beatrice.

05:10.944 --> 05:15.080
Oh, no, no.
Thank you for sharing
it with me.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.449
So generous.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.252
- [knock on door]
- I wonder who that could be.

05:20.254 --> 05:23.588
[laughs]

05:23.590 --> 05:25.791
[hisses]

05:25.793 --> 05:28.093
- [caws]
- [whimpers]

05:28.095 --> 05:29.828
Ha ha ha!

05:29.830 --> 05:31.830
James, you're back.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.532
And you've brought
more mateys.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.201
We're mateys,
but Le Beak is not.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.070
- She's trouble!
- She's trouble!

05:38.072 --> 05:41.840
Beatrice?
Why, she wouldn't
hurt a fly.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.142
[screeches]

05:45.445 --> 05:48.914
- Rosie, are you OK?
- [meows]

05:48.916 --> 05:51.116
It's what I've been
trying to tell you.

05:51.118 --> 05:54.453
Le Beak is a rotten sneak.

05:54.455 --> 05:57.322
Ha ha! You can't
blame a pirate gal

05:57.324 --> 06:01.293
for wanting the finer
things in life, can you?

06:01.295 --> 06:03.395
Thorny roses!

06:03.397 --> 06:04.696
Me treasures.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.432
You mean <i>me</i> treasures.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.868
[laughs]

06:09.870 --> 06:14.573
Oh, dear, I think you've
just been Le Beaked.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.742
Well, I'm not letting

06:16.744 --> 06:20.312
that silver-tongued sneak
get away with this.

06:20.314 --> 06:22.647
Don't worry.
We'll all help.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.484
And I shall help the most.

06:25.486 --> 06:29.321
How can we get
into the castle?
It's all locked up.

06:29.323 --> 06:31.823
[meows]

06:31.825 --> 06:35.293
Rosie's got a plan.
She and I can slip
through the kitty hatch

06:35.295 --> 06:38.296
and open the door
from the other side.

06:41.768 --> 06:46.238
- Tag, you're it.
- [screeches]

06:46.240 --> 06:49.474
Yoo-hoo, featherhead.

06:49.476 --> 06:52.511
Whoo-hoo!
Go for it, Rosie.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.513
[squeals]

06:54.515 --> 06:56.214
Well done, Rosie!

06:56.216 --> 06:58.049
Awesome coconuts.

06:58.051 --> 07:01.853
We opened the door
and got three gold doubloons.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.790
Let's grab 'em
and go stop Le Beak.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.394
[laughs]

07:09.396 --> 07:11.296
Ahem.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.598
- Oh!
- I believe you are...

07:13.600 --> 07:17.002
how you say...
le busted!

07:17.004 --> 07:20.906
<i>Oui, oui,</i> say <i>au revoir.</i>

07:20.908 --> 07:24.676
I'd rather say
anchors aweigh!

07:25.812 --> 07:27.212
Gotcha!

07:27.214 --> 07:29.748
Aww, rotten Roquefort.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.818
Keep your lousy loot.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.287
Ha-ha!

07:35.289 --> 07:39.391
Yay-hey! We saved a sack
of Red Jessica's art collection

07:39.393 --> 07:42.360
and we got three
more gold doubloons.

07:42.362 --> 07:46.731
Let's grab 'em and go
after that sneaky Le Beak.

07:46.733 --> 07:49.301
She's still got
me necklace.

07:50.436 --> 07:53.738
[Le Beak] Ha ha ha!

07:53.740 --> 07:57.442
Oh! And me ship.

07:59.779 --> 08:03.782
Ha ha ha!
There is no stopping

08:03.784 --> 08:05.951
Beatrice Le Beak.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.487
[Hook]
That's what you think.

08:08.489 --> 08:11.323
Oh, it cannot be.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.725
I believe you have some
things that belong

08:13.727 --> 08:16.962
to milady, Red Jessica.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.731
Don't be silly,
Hook pirate.

08:19.733 --> 08:23.602
These things,
they now belong to Le Beak.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.172
Strike your colors,
you sneak,

08:27.174 --> 08:30.041
and prepare to be boarded.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.811
[caws]

08:32.813 --> 08:35.447
[gasps]

08:35.449 --> 08:37.883
- [Jake] You heard Captain Hook.
- Huh?

08:37.885 --> 08:41.520
Now hear me.
Prepare to be boarded.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.055
<i>Le</i> rats. Fastclaw.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.027
[Rosie screeching]

08:52.365 --> 08:54.466
Yo-ho, let's go!

08:54.468 --> 08:56.501
- Aye-aye!
- Whoo-hoo!

08:57.637 --> 08:59.871
OK, Madam Pirate Le Beak,

08:59.873 --> 09:03.041
it's time for you
to abandon Red Jessica's ship.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.176
And her pearl necklace.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.345
So give up already.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.381
Give up? No, no.

09:09.383 --> 09:13.385
The only giving up will
be you petite pirates

09:13.387 --> 09:14.953
giving up to me,

09:14.955 --> 09:17.656
or I will drop the necklace

09:17.658 --> 09:20.425
into the Never Sea

09:20.427 --> 09:25.363
and you will "never see"
it again, eh?

09:25.365 --> 09:29.568
[Hook]
Confounded sail.
I can't see a blasted thing.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.704
Aha!

09:33.839 --> 09:36.741
- Whoa!
- Izzy, the necklace!

09:36.743 --> 09:39.077
Pixie dust away!

09:43.583 --> 09:45.083
Gotcha!

09:45.085 --> 09:48.019
<i>Le</i> phooey!

09:48.021 --> 09:49.988
We saved
the Ruby Pearl necklace,

09:49.990 --> 09:52.123
caught sneaky Le Beak,

09:52.125 --> 09:54.593
and we got
three more gold doubloons.

09:54.595 --> 09:58.597
Let's grab 'em and go return
the Ruby Pearl necklace.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.132
Aye-aye, Izzy.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.436
Aha, splendid!

10:04.438 --> 10:06.838
Now if you don't mind,

10:06.840 --> 10:08.273
Red Jessica.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.109
Thanks, James.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.078
And thanks to all of you,

10:13.080 --> 10:16.348
me real pirate pals.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.283
You're welcome.

10:20.453 --> 10:24.255
Thanks for helping us save
Red Jessica's art collection,
mateys.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.224
Now let's count
our gold doubloons

10:26.226 --> 10:28.326
and put 'em in our
team treasure chest.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.535
<i>¶ Weigh-hey,</i>
<i>well done, crew ¶</i>

10:37.537 --> 10:39.771

<i>¶ It's time to count</i>

10:44.811 --> 10:47.212
Come on, count with us.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.748
[all] Yeah!

10:49.750 --> 10:53.118

10:55.689 --> 10:58.223

10:58.225 --> 11:01.559
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:01.561 --> 11:04.295
we got nine gold doubloons.

11:05.297 --> 11:07.532
And I've got us a snack...

11:07.534 --> 11:11.469
delicious coconut chips
ala Cubby.

11:11.471 --> 11:15.607
- Hey!
- You've just been
<i>Le</i> Skullied. [laughs]

11:15.609 --> 11:18.643
Just kidding, mates.
Help yourselves.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.779
[laughing]

11:23.115 --> 11:25.917
Thank you again for getting
me treasures back

11:25.919 --> 11:28.553
from that thievin' sneak
Le Beak.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.388
Yes, well,

11:30.390 --> 11:33.825
here's to you,
Red Jessica,

11:33.827 --> 11:38.096
the Crimson Castle's
greatest treasure.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.999
Oh, James.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.401
[Le Beak]
Oh, sweet bilge water.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.404
And as for you Le Beak,

11:46.406 --> 11:48.506
I'm going to strand you

11:48.508 --> 11:52.544
on a desert isle where you
can't cause any more trouble.

11:52.546 --> 11:56.214
Maybe you will do
this stranding,

11:56.216 --> 11:58.950
or maybe I will borrow your...

11:58.952 --> 12:02.520
how you say...
"whirly hook."

12:02.522 --> 12:05.557
<i>Au revoir,</i>
<i>mon capitaine.</i>

12:05.559 --> 12:08.827
Me whirly hook?!
Not again!

12:08.829 --> 12:13.331
- Blast you, sneaky Le Beak!
- Ha ha ha!

12:18.738 --> 12:23.074
[Cubby]
Calling all mateys!

12:23.076 --> 12:24.642
Check it out.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.945
What's going on, Cubby?

12:26.947 --> 12:29.280
Yeah, check what out?

12:29.282 --> 12:33.818
I give you Cubby's
Amazing Marble Raceway.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.553
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

12:35.555 --> 12:38.723
It's time for the very
first marble run

12:38.725 --> 12:40.892
and you are here
to see it.

12:40.894 --> 12:45.296
For this special occasion,
I'll use my most awesome marble.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.965
My skull-n-bones.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.401
There's only a few of these
babies in all of Never Land.

12:50.403 --> 12:53.838
They're very rare.
Here it goes, mateys.

12:54.874 --> 12:58.109
- Yo-ho!
- Amazing!

13:02.782 --> 13:04.849
Oh, no!
My skull-n-bones.

13:08.254 --> 13:11.422
It's... it's gone.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.758
I can't believe I lost it.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.095
But your marble raceway
sure was exciting.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.965
And you still got a whole jar
of marbles you can race.

13:20.967 --> 13:25.303
I guess. But I'm really
gonna miss that skull-n-bones.

13:25.305 --> 13:29.240
Sweet coconuts, look!
It's an old map.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.209
Peter must have
hid it here.

13:31.211 --> 13:34.746
And it looks like
it leads to Treasurefalls.

13:34.748 --> 13:38.750
Treasurefalls. That means
the legends are true.

13:38.752 --> 13:42.053
An endless waterfall
of gold and riches.

13:42.055 --> 13:45.190
Maybe I can find another
skull-n-bones.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.458
Look, there's a warning.

13:47.460 --> 13:51.429
"Remember, not a piece
of treasure may be taken
from Treasurefalls

13:51.431 --> 13:56.000
or the jungle will trap you
and your mateys forever."

13:56.002 --> 13:59.270
Crackers!
That's some warning.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.039
And some treasure!

14:01.041 --> 14:04.342
Maybe seeing Treasurefalls
will cheer you up, Cubby.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.945
Um, yeah, maybe it will.

14:06.947 --> 14:11.115
Mateys, will you
sail with us to see
the awesome Treasurefalls?

14:12.618 --> 14:15.820
Great! Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

14:15.822 --> 14:19.724
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.694
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our team treasure chest.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.996
Yo-ho, let's go!

14:28.400 --> 14:31.402
- <i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys aweigh </i>
<i>- [bell dings]</i>

14:31.404 --> 14:34.472
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

14:34.474 --> 14:37.442
- Let's go!
- <i>¶ Heave-ho,</i>
<i>here we go together ¶</i>

14:37.444 --> 14:38.810
<i>¶ As a team </i>

14:38.812 --> 14:41.579
<i>¶ Jake and the Never</i>
<i>Land Pirates ¶</i>

14:41.581 --> 14:43.715
<i>¶ And me </i>

14:46.051 --> 14:50.555
What in Neptune's name are
you two doing up there?

14:50.557 --> 14:53.157
We're milkin' coconuts,
Captain.

14:53.159 --> 14:57.061
We squeezed a whole
bucketful, sir.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.497
You bumbling bunglers.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.700
You can't milk
coconuts that way.

15:02.702 --> 15:06.137
- [both] You can't?
- Then I guess we better
get rid of this.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.573
[spits]

15:08.575 --> 15:10.642
You simpletons!

15:10.644 --> 15:14.545
Captain Hook, sir.
Popinjays approaching.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.114
[gasps] Hide.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.783
Quickly, Smee,
up this tree.

15:18.785 --> 15:23.054
Aye-aye, sir.
[grunts]

15:23.056 --> 15:25.023
Lead the way, Cubby.

15:25.025 --> 15:28.793
Treasurefalls is
this-a-way, mateys.

15:28.795 --> 15:32.163
So those grubby
little guppies

15:32.165 --> 15:34.265
are going to
Treasurefalls.

15:34.267 --> 15:38.102
We shall follow them.
[cackles]

15:38.104 --> 15:40.972
But, Captain,
everyone knows the legend.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.108
You can look,
but you can't take.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.946
Aye. The jungle will
trap us forever and ever

15:47.948 --> 15:51.883
if we take even
the itty-bittiest
bit of treasure.

15:51.885 --> 15:54.619
Nonsense.

15:54.621 --> 15:58.656
Follow those pint-sized
sea pests.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.960
- Whoa!
- [thud]

16:01.962 --> 16:04.796
Hmm. The map says
the Treasurefalls

16:04.798 --> 16:08.266
is somewhere beyond
this big rock.

16:08.268 --> 16:11.869
Yay-hey, this is
one thick jungle.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.706
Yeah, but look up there.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.908
[Skully]
24-carat crackers!

16:16.910 --> 16:19.110
Treasurefalls ho!

16:19.112 --> 16:22.747
We found it.
And we got three
gold doubloons.

16:22.749 --> 16:27.118
Let's grab 'em
and go check out the falls.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.587
Yo-ho-whoa!

16:29.589 --> 16:34.058
[Izzy] It's so beautiful.

16:34.060 --> 16:37.095
[Jake] It's every pirate's
dream come true!

16:37.097 --> 16:41.666
Remember, mateys, we can't
take even an eensy-teensy
piece of it.

16:41.668 --> 16:46.070
Got it, Jake.
Whoa! Mateys, look.

16:46.072 --> 16:50.241
It's another skull-n-bones,
just like the one I lost.

16:50.243 --> 16:54.612
Careful, Cubby.
Taking that marble
could trap us all here.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.882
But it is just
one little marble.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.917
[Izzy] Yay-hey, no way!

16:59.919 --> 17:01.486
What is it, mateys?

17:01.488 --> 17:05.289
Faster, men.
Grab all you can and more.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.525
Captain Hook,
if you take anything,

17:07.527 --> 17:09.794
the jungle will trap us all.

17:09.796 --> 17:13.031
Yes, so I've heard,
puny pirate.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.633
Keep stuffin' treasure,
lads.

17:15.635 --> 17:19.170
<i>¶ There be seven wonders</i>
<i>of the seven seas ¶</i>

17:19.172 --> 17:21.506
<i>¶ I think I've</i>
<i>seen them all ¶</i>

17:21.508 --> 17:25.443
<i>¶ Well, there ain't so sight</i>
<i>like the golden hikes</i>
<i>of Treasurefalls ¶</i>

17:25.445 --> 17:27.145
<i>¶ Glimmerin'</i>
<i>shimmerin' gems ¶</i>

17:27.147 --> 17:29.847
<i>¶ And gold fillin'</i>
<i>the pool below ¶</i>

17:29.849 --> 17:32.984
<i>¶ There's a fortune here</i>
<i>for one and all ¶</i>

17:32.986 --> 17:36.754
<i>¶ If we don't get trapped</i>
<i>at Treasurefalls ¶</i>

17:36.756 --> 17:39.223
[loud rumbling]

17:39.225 --> 17:41.959
[Cubby] The jungle,
it's growing wild!

17:41.961 --> 17:45.029
Aww, coconuts.
Hook's really done it now.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.398
The Treasurefalls!

17:51.670 --> 17:55.840
Hook, you snooky-crook.
Look what you did.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.376
[Jake] The jungle's
trapped us all.

17:58.378 --> 18:01.412
Not all of us, popinjays.

18:01.414 --> 18:05.583
You see, I, Captain Hook,
have a plan.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.252
Men, get your whirly-hooks.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.556
Love to stay and chat, Jake,

18:11.558 --> 18:15.093
but I have booty
to pirate away. Ha!

18:15.095 --> 18:17.061
Yay-hey, no way!

18:18.097 --> 18:20.698
Treacherous trees!

18:20.700 --> 18:23.434
There be no way out, sir.

18:23.436 --> 18:27.305
Let me go,
you sneaky snakies.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.208
All right, here,
take me whirly-hook.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.776
Help!

18:31.778 --> 18:33.878
This is an emergency.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.848
Pixie dust away!

18:36.850 --> 18:39.016
[screams]

18:41.954 --> 18:44.856
Oh. I'm all good.

18:44.858 --> 18:46.457
Thanks, Izzy.

18:48.193 --> 18:51.362
- Nice save, Iz.
- Thanks, Jake.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.898
We helped Bones and got
four more gold doubloons.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.669
Let's grab 'em and...
uh... gosh.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.205
How are we supposed
to go anywhere?

19:01.207 --> 19:03.074
Stand back, men.

19:03.076 --> 19:05.643
I shall whack me way
through these weeds

19:05.645 --> 19:08.212
with me whacker-weed-hook.

19:12.284 --> 19:16.554
Give me back me hook.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.057
Fine.
Keep the silly thing.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.893
It's clearly broken.

19:21.895 --> 19:24.629
Captain Hook,
I have an idea.

19:24.631 --> 19:27.732
Maybe if we put all
the treasure back
where we found it,

19:27.734 --> 19:29.901
the jungle will let us go.

19:29.903 --> 19:32.570
- Oh, I like it.
- Sounds good to me.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.238
Let's do it.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.844
Now it's your turn,
Captain Hook.

19:39.846 --> 19:43.814
No,
this treasure is mine.
Mine, I tells ya.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.584
But, Captain,
what's more important?

19:46.586 --> 19:50.054
Your treasure
or your freedom?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.257
Well, Captain Hook?

19:53.259 --> 19:55.026
I'm thinking.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.828
Captain Hook, we all want
to get out of here.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.463
You have to do it.

19:59.465 --> 20:03.134
There is no way I'll be
throwing me treasure back.

20:03.136 --> 20:04.802
You can't make me.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.371
- Ugh!
- What are we gonna do?

20:07.373 --> 20:11.542
Hook always does the exact
opposite of whatever we
ask him to do.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.344
Now watch this.

20:13.346 --> 20:17.982
Captain Hook, I command you
to dump that treasure
back into the pond.

20:17.984 --> 20:21.219
I shall never
dump me treasure.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.855
I mean it, Captain Hook,
don't dump that treasure.

20:24.857 --> 20:29.694
Oh, but I will
dump me treasure.
[laughing]

20:32.331 --> 20:34.065
Oh, blast.

20:34.067 --> 20:37.501
And you call me
a sneaky-snook.

20:37.503 --> 20:40.571
Sorry, Captain Hook.

20:40.573 --> 20:44.208
The Treasurefalls!
It's back.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.843
Lookee up there.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.679
The branches are
pulling back.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.582
Whoo-hoo. We're free.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.685
We did it. We got
the Treasurefalls
flowing again.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.421
And we got five more
gold doubloons.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.424
Let's grab 'em and go.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.694
[sobs] Me treasure.

21:03.696 --> 21:06.764
[Bones and Sharky]
Oh, no, you don't, Captain.

21:06.766 --> 21:11.035
Farewell, treasure.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.738
Farewell, skull-n-bones.

21:16.074 --> 21:19.310
Thanks for exploring
Treasurefalls with us,
mateys.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.312
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

21:21.314 --> 21:23.614
into our team treasure chest.

21:30.555 --> 21:32.890
<i>¶ Weigh-hey,</i>
<i>well done, crew ¶</i>

21:32.892 --> 21:35.226
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:35.228 --> 21:37.194
<i>¶ Weigh-hey,</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

21:37.196 --> 21:40.064
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

21:40.066 --> 21:42.300
Come on, count with us.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.902
[all] Yeah!

21:44.904 --> 21:48.239
[Cubby]
One, two, three.

21:48.241 --> 21:50.107
[Izzy]
Four, five,

21:50.109 --> 21:51.776
six, seven.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.145
[Jake]
Eight, nine, ten,

21:54.147 --> 21:57.381
11, 12! Yay-hey!

21:57.383 --> 21:59.450
For solving
pirate problems today,

21:59.452 --> 22:02.887
we got 12 gold doubloons.

22:02.889 --> 22:06.090
And most of all,
we're pirate-proud of you,

22:06.092 --> 22:10.328
Cubby, for not taking that
marble from Treasurefalls.

22:10.330 --> 22:13.164
Thanks, mateys,
but I still miss...

22:13.166 --> 22:14.899
- [loud snap]
- Youch!

22:14.901 --> 22:18.769
Hey, it's Snappy.
Check out his other claw.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.172
My skull-n-bones marble.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.674
[speaks gibberish]

22:23.676 --> 22:26.911
Snappy found it. Thanks.

22:28.313 --> 22:30.114
I think he wants
to watch it zoom

22:30.116 --> 22:32.516
down Cubby's Amazing
Marble Raceway.

22:32.518 --> 22:35.219
- We all do.
- [laughing]

22:37.756 --> 22:42.626
Oh, I'll never see
Treasurefalls again.

22:42.628 --> 22:45.463
[Smee]
Oh, Captain, sir.

22:45.465 --> 22:49.900
We thought we'd cheer you up
with a Jolly Roger
Treasurefalls,

22:49.902 --> 22:54.505
filled with booty
from your very own
treasure cave.

22:54.507 --> 22:59.110
- Smee, no, stop, Smee!
- Let 'er rip, boys.

22:59.112 --> 23:02.046
- No, no!
- [Smee] Isn't it
lovely, Captain?

23:02.048 --> 23:03.447
Oh.

23:03.449 --> 23:06.584
Smee!

23:06.586 --> 23:08.085
<i>¶ Grab 'em and go </i>

23:08.087 --> 23:09.687
<i>¶ Yo-ho, yo-ho! </i>

23:09.689 --> 23:12.723
<i>¶ We found</i>
