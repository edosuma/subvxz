WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:01.258
Just this gum.

00:02.202 --> 00:04.505
Ooh, phone cradle...

00:04.537 --> 00:06.039
I could use one of these.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.074

00:19.618 --> 00:20.419
Come on.

00:20.452 --> 00:22.155
Instant garbage!

00:22.189 --> 00:24.257
- Hi, I'm Bryce Shivers.
- And I'm Lisa Eversman.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.393
- And we make...
- Instant garbage.

00:26.425 --> 00:28.294
Double USB chargers
for your car

00:28.327 --> 00:30.631
that only work sometimes.
Garbage.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.399
This won't fit any phone.

00:32.432 --> 00:33.700
Garbage.

00:33.732 --> 00:36.436
Headphones...
they'll hurt your ears.

00:36.469 --> 00:37.603
- Ow.
- Are you okay?

00:39.539 --> 00:41.108
Oh, wait, here.

00:41.140 --> 00:42.675
Ow. Instant garbage.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.512
If you don't wanna throw away
your instant garbage,

00:44.545 --> 00:46.079
you could put it
in a drawer you hate

00:46.113 --> 00:48.049
for years and years.

00:48.669 --> 00:50.503
A drawer you never clean out,
until you're getting a divorce

00:50.571 --> 00:52.371
or having a nervous breakdown.

00:53.441 --> 00:55.007
Bryce, how much is this stuff?

00:55.076 --> 00:56.842
$4.99.

00:56.911 --> 00:59.512
<i>We found the exact point
between price and hassle</i>

00:59.580 --> 01:02.147
that guarantees you won't bother
returning our products.

01:02.216 --> 01:03.716
Are you really gonna drive
all the way back

01:03.784 --> 01:06.018
to that mall kiosk
to demand your money back?

01:06.087 --> 01:07.887
- You should.
- But you won't.

01:07.955 --> 01:10.756
And that kiosk
is probably gone anyway.

01:10.825 --> 01:12.958
Okay, this shipment's
going to Poughkeepsie.

01:13.027 --> 01:14.460
Ah, Poughkeepsie.

01:17.598 --> 01:19.665
Gainesville.

01:19.734 --> 01:21.200
Mm, no.

01:21.269 --> 01:22.301
- Does it matter?
- No.

01:22.370 --> 01:24.970
All right.

01:25.039 --> 01:26.539
Okay, that's everything.

01:26.607 --> 01:28.407
Have you taken a break yet?

01:28.476 --> 01:29.742
You can go on break.

01:33.948 --> 01:36.181
- You know something?
- Huh?

01:36.250 --> 01:37.583
I think I'm gonna try this.

01:37.652 --> 01:39.985
It says compatible with iPad.

01:41.589 --> 01:42.721
There you go.

01:45.393 --> 01:47.092
I've never seen it
do that before.

01:47.161 --> 01:49.328
And it's very hot.

Sync and corrections by n17t01

02:10.717 --> 02:12.351
So how many miles
are you jogging?

02:12.419 --> 02:14.219
- Uh, like, six.
- Really?

02:14.288 --> 02:15.888
No, that's really low now.

02:15.956 --> 02:17.256
- Oh, that's lower.
- It's-- yeah.

02:17.324 --> 02:18.323
Wow, that--
you're during great.

02:18.392 --> 02:19.524
- Thanks.
- Hey, bud.

02:19.593 --> 02:20.826
- Aww.
- Who's this cutie?

02:20.895 --> 02:22.327
What a cute dog.

02:22.396 --> 02:23.896
You know,
you're really great with dogs.

02:23.964 --> 02:25.597
- I am?
- Yeah.

02:25.666 --> 02:27.833
- You've never had one.
- Well, I had one as a kid.

02:27.902 --> 02:30.002
You should get one now.

02:30.070 --> 02:32.404
- Maybe I should.
- Yeah.

02:32.473 --> 02:35.540
S-so they all are up to date
on their shots?

02:35.609 --> 02:37.676
- Yes, of course...
- Okay.

02:37.745 --> 02:39.544
We are totally OCD about that.

02:39.613 --> 02:41.914
But, um--
this is Chip,

02:41.982 --> 02:44.383
and, um, yeah.

02:44.451 --> 02:46.919
- So, uh, oh, hi.
- Oh, hi.

02:46.987 --> 02:48.520
Daphne, hi.

02:48.589 --> 02:50.722
Hi, Daphne.

02:50.791 --> 02:52.391
So this one's so cute.

02:52.459 --> 02:55.093
Yeah, people love cute.
Everybody loves cute,

02:55.162 --> 02:57.129
so she'll probably only be here
a couple of days.

02:57.197 --> 02:59.264
- Oh, I-- I like cute too.
- Yeah.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.899
- Yeah.
- Course you do.

03:00.968 --> 03:03.435
And this is Chico.

03:03.504 --> 03:04.903
What's his story?

03:04.972 --> 03:06.772
Well, he's been here
almost a year,

03:06.840 --> 03:08.307
and we're really--

03:08.375 --> 03:10.242
we're really running
out of options.

03:10.311 --> 03:13.278
People have all these beliefs
about pit bulls.

03:13.347 --> 03:15.247
People think that
they're aggressive,

03:15.316 --> 03:17.282
and it's crazy, 'cause they're
incredibly sweet dogs.

03:17.351 --> 03:20.585
It's just ignorance
and discrimination.

03:20.654 --> 03:21.954
You know
how ignorant people are.

03:22.022 --> 03:23.655
Yeah.

03:23.724 --> 03:26.291
You know, he's just a
misunderstood miracle, this guy.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.560
Are you misunderstood, Chico?

03:28.629 --> 03:29.828
Yeah.

03:29.897 --> 03:32.431
Yeah.
Wow...

03:32.499 --> 03:34.433
You just seem like
a really strong woman.

03:34.501 --> 03:37.636
You could really make
a difference in this dog's life.

03:37.705 --> 03:39.304
Are-- are you interested?

03:42.142 --> 03:44.343
Okay.
All right, Chico.

03:44.411 --> 03:47.412
This is great.
This is my street.

03:47.481 --> 03:48.680
Pit bull.

03:48.749 --> 03:50.615
Go inside.

03:50.684 --> 03:54.686
Hi.
Oh, no, they left their shoes.

03:54.755 --> 03:56.254
That's silly.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.357
Look, another pit bull.

03:58.425 --> 04:01.126
Hey, it's really good
what we're doing.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.965
It's not so bad out.
It's kinda nice actually.

04:07.034 --> 04:09.201
Ah, you're such a good
little walker.

04:11.538 --> 04:13.038
That's weird.

04:13.107 --> 04:15.807
It's okay.
Yeah, she was kinda scary, huh?

04:18.278 --> 04:20.012
Wow, what a good boy.

04:20.079 --> 04:21.646
Hey, excuse me.

04:21.714 --> 04:24.649
It's really good
what we're doing for these dogs.

04:24.718 --> 04:26.618
What?

04:28.088 --> 04:29.888
Chico!
Chico!

04:29.957 --> 04:31.890
Chico!
No!

04:36.864 --> 04:39.131
Chico...

04:41.902 --> 04:43.635
My hand still hurts.

04:43.704 --> 04:46.471
I get it.
You've had a hard life, right?

04:46.540 --> 04:48.306
I know how it looks
to other people.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.642
People don't expect
much from you, right?

04:50.744 --> 04:52.010
They see you, and they think,

04:52.079 --> 04:53.512
"He's not gonna
amount to anything.

04:53.580 --> 04:55.580
He's from nowhere.
He's going nowhere.

04:55.649 --> 04:56.915
He's nothing."

04:56.984 --> 05:00.018
But I don't believe
for one second

05:00.087 --> 05:02.054
that you're what
those other people say you are.

05:02.122 --> 05:05.257
You are not that at all.

05:05.325 --> 05:06.825
I'm Sandra, by the way.

05:06.894 --> 05:08.060
I guess I----

05:08.128 --> 05:09.995
I never really
introduced myself.

05:11.498 --> 05:12.931
I grew up in Boulder.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.399
You'll probably never go there.

05:14.468 --> 05:20.372
Uh, both my parents are--
are dead, so...

05:20.441 --> 05:22.941
I'm not gonna tell you
what to do.

05:23.010 --> 05:25.110
You have to decide.

05:25.179 --> 05:28.180
I need to know what you want.

05:35.122 --> 05:36.955
- What do you feel like doing?
- I don't know.

05:37.024 --> 05:38.390
I, uh-- it's raining,

05:38.459 --> 05:40.625
so maybe we should go
inside somewhere.

05:40.694 --> 05:42.594
Train Station Museum.
What's this thing?

05:42.663 --> 05:44.763
A museum could be fun.

05:44.832 --> 05:46.264
- Hello.
- Hi.

05:46.333 --> 05:48.900
Welcome to the, uh,
Train Station Museum.

05:48.969 --> 05:52.137
- Is there a gift shop here?
- Uh, not really.

05:52.206 --> 05:54.106
- Is there a train ride?
- It's just a museum

05:54.174 --> 05:57.109
to showcase, uh, the history
of-- of train stations.

05:57.177 --> 05:58.810
You wanna go do that?
We'll go look at the trains--

05:58.879 --> 06:01.079
Well, there's nothing else
to do, so let's try.

06:01.148 --> 06:04.316
All right, yeah,
so-- so two, please.

06:04.384 --> 06:05.750
- Thank you very much.
- Okay, thank you.

06:05.819 --> 06:06.918
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks, en-enjoy.

06:09.490 --> 06:12.457
"1901, railway
and locomotive engineering."

06:12.526 --> 06:14.659
- Maybe that's a logging tree?
- So which goes to which?

06:14.728 --> 06:17.562
Can you just explain that to me?
Or you can ask that lady?

06:17.631 --> 06:19.297
That information
is on the placard.

06:19.366 --> 06:21.099
Okay, thank you.

06:21.168 --> 06:23.768
Oh...
what is this?

06:23.837 --> 06:25.103
It's a uniform.

06:25.172 --> 06:26.805
That's one of
our most popular pieces.

06:26.874 --> 06:28.273
Oh, here's a button.

06:30.911 --> 06:32.911
Sorry, that button
doesn't work right now.

06:32.980 --> 06:34.479
Oh, look, a tin can.

06:34.548 --> 06:35.780
You know what
that reminds me of--

06:35.849 --> 06:37.149
"The Wizard of Oz."

06:37.217 --> 06:38.617
- The Tin Man.
- The Tin Man.

06:38.685 --> 06:40.318
The order that
I like the, um, characters

06:40.387 --> 06:43.121
is, um-- I like Scarecrow one.

06:43.190 --> 06:44.656
- Lion.
- The Lion second.

06:44.725 --> 06:46.658
- Mm.
- And the Tinman third.

06:46.727 --> 06:48.860
I always thought you used to
like the Lion first.

06:48.929 --> 06:49.995
- No.
- Are you sure?

06:50.063 --> 06:51.696
- I changed the order.
- Okay.

06:51.765 --> 06:53.431
Yeah, I'm looking
at the same shot,

06:53.500 --> 06:54.966
and it has nothing to do
with Portland.

06:55.035 --> 06:56.701
Like, why is that here,
you know?

06:56.770 --> 06:58.837
It's just some old movie
of trains.

06:58.906 --> 07:00.205
It's for entertainment.

07:00.274 --> 07:01.940
Uh, the video's in
a one-minute loop.

07:02.009 --> 07:04.209
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. I have no idea.

07:08.382 --> 07:11.116
- Oh, great.
- Is there, like, another, uh,

07:11.185 --> 07:13.318
- part of the museum?
- Oh, no, that's it.

07:13.387 --> 07:15.120
- That's the whole thing?
- We have a map.

07:15.189 --> 07:17.689
It goes all the way,
all the way around.

07:17.758 --> 07:19.124
Yep, that's--

07:19.193 --> 07:20.859
- That's that?
- That's that.

07:20.928 --> 07:23.728
There wasn't really anything.
There was no train ride.

07:23.797 --> 07:25.697
There-- there was nothing
about this place

07:25.766 --> 07:27.299
that said "rides."

07:27.367 --> 07:29.067
It said "train,"
and when I think train,

07:29.136 --> 07:30.735
- I think a ride.
- Right. Yeah.

07:30.804 --> 07:32.470
Well.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.972
And it's not the happiest
place on Earth here.

07:34.041 --> 07:35.740
No-- there's only one

07:35.809 --> 07:37.909
happiest place on Earth,
and that's Disney.

07:37.978 --> 07:39.411
What you should have is
you should have, like,

07:39.479 --> 07:41.513
a virtual reality train ride.

07:41.582 --> 07:43.915
And it goes through
all the eras in history.

07:43.984 --> 07:45.917
And the conductor
gets older and older,

07:45.986 --> 07:47.485
you know, digitally.

07:47.554 --> 07:51.223
I definitely a-a-appreciate
all of your feedback

07:51.291 --> 07:53.558
and comments,
and I take that to heart.

07:53.627 --> 07:54.926
- Well, thank you, anyway.
- Thank you.

07:54.995 --> 07:56.027
- And we had a nice time.
- Have a nice day.

07:56.096 --> 07:57.662
We had a very nice time.

07:57.731 --> 07:59.431
Yes.
Let's go to our lunch.

07:59.499 --> 08:00.732
Trains are very collectible,

08:00.801 --> 08:02.000
especially around
Christmas time.

08:02.069 --> 08:03.368
- Yeah.
- Enjoy your day.

08:03.437 --> 08:05.036
Like, my house has
more collectibles

08:05.105 --> 08:06.304
in the kitchen.

08:09.129 --> 08:11.363
- Hey, Fred.
- Max.

08:11.431 --> 08:12.664
- How are you doing?
- What are you in town, man?

08:12.733 --> 08:14.966
- Uh, a photoshoot.
- Whoa, nice.

08:15.035 --> 08:17.068
I actually got
the whole Moothie campaign.

08:17.137 --> 08:18.737
What's-- you got
a Moothie campaign?

08:18.805 --> 08:20.539
Moothie-- the biggest clothing
company in the world?

08:20.607 --> 08:22.073
- You know who Moothie is?
- No.

08:22.142 --> 08:23.308
There's an article in
the "New York Times"

08:23.377 --> 08:24.910
- about him this week.
- Wow.

08:24.978 --> 08:26.411
Like, let me show you
a few of the proofs, like.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.813
- Uh, this is what you did?
- Yeah.

08:28.882 --> 08:31.316
This picture--
the-- the girl in this photo--

08:31.385 --> 08:36.020
her face is very, very--
it's so, um--

08:36.089 --> 08:38.423
Yeah, that's Cameron Russell.
She's a supermodel.

08:38.491 --> 08:40.025
Uh, she's just over here with
the rest of the Moothie crew.

08:40.092 --> 08:42.059
Would you like to meet 'em?

08:42.129 --> 08:43.528
- Yeah.
- Abso-- come on over.

08:43.597 --> 08:45.063
I'll introduce ya.

08:45.132 --> 08:47.098
Cameron, Gregory, this is, uh,
my old friend, Fred.

08:47.167 --> 08:48.567
- Please, Gregory from Moothie.
- Gregory.

08:48.635 --> 08:50.001
- Cameron Russell.
- Nice to meet you.

08:50.070 --> 08:54.172
Hi, um, he just showed me,
uh, pictures of you.

08:54.241 --> 08:55.740
- Mm-hmm.
- And, I mean--

08:55.809 --> 08:59.444
it-- it just-- look,
you're-- you're very...

08:59.513 --> 09:02.581
pretty and beautiful,
physically in the face.

09:04.484 --> 09:06.017
I don't think she likes to
make a big deal of that stuff.

09:06.086 --> 09:07.686
- It just--
- But-- but I do.

09:07.754 --> 09:09.854
- Okay.
- I mean, when I see people--

09:09.923 --> 09:11.756
I'm just like one of
those weird people

09:11.825 --> 09:15.060
who notices when
someone is pretty.

09:15.128 --> 09:16.461
She's a model.
That's the point.

09:16.530 --> 09:17.696
- They-- they picked her.
- But your face--

09:17.764 --> 09:20.765
it ha-- it-- it has formed
in a very, um,

09:20.834 --> 09:23.301
pretty and beautiful way,
and I'll bet you anything

09:23.370 --> 09:24.703
that that's why they put you
on a magazine.

09:24.771 --> 09:25.904
- She's a model...
- Yes.

09:25.973 --> 09:26.972
They act--
they actually chose her.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.139
Well, I don't wanna be crass,

09:28.208 --> 09:29.574
but I think you should
charge money

09:29.643 --> 09:31.142
for people taking
pictures of you.

09:31.211 --> 09:32.243
- I actually-- I do.
- You do?

09:32.312 --> 09:33.712
- Yeah.
- She's a model.

09:33.780 --> 09:35.580
That's--
that's why they hired her.

09:35.649 --> 09:37.449
He's a friend of yours?

09:37.517 --> 09:38.817
Old friend.

09:38.885 --> 09:40.251
All right, well,
it's nice to meet you.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.553
All right, nice to meet you.
Thank you.

09:41.622 --> 09:42.554
Always love seeing you,
Fred.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.956
- Carrie...
- Hey.

09:45.025 --> 09:47.092
Okay, you know Max, right?

09:47.160 --> 09:48.727
- Mm-hmm.
- He's in town right now,

09:48.795 --> 09:50.428
- and he's doing a photoshoot.
- That's great.

09:50.497 --> 09:52.497
- Guess why.
- 'Cause that's his job.

09:52.566 --> 09:54.733
Yeah.
He photographs people.

09:54.801 --> 09:57.235
Look at this person
on the cover of the magazine.

09:57.304 --> 09:59.237
- Oh, Cameron Russell.
- You know who this is?

09:59.306 --> 10:00.772
She's a really famous model.

10:00.841 --> 10:02.907
But look at the way
the clothes are falling on her.

10:02.976 --> 10:04.843
Yeah, yeah, I mean--
whoa, yeah.

10:04.911 --> 10:07.312
We're kind of, like,
in the same jacket.

10:07.381 --> 10:08.647
You would never know.

10:08.715 --> 10:10.582
'Cause on her,
it's very natural.

10:10.651 --> 10:13.251
With you, it seems like you're
propped up inside a puppet,

10:13.320 --> 10:14.953
or, like, a cardboard cutout
of clothing.

10:15.022 --> 10:16.254
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

10:16.323 --> 10:17.856
So if you look through here,

10:17.924 --> 10:19.658
you'll see that there are
other pretty women

10:19.726 --> 10:22.160
- that are models.
- Who's that? She's beautiful.

10:22.229 --> 10:23.962
And she's beautiful.

10:24.031 --> 10:25.930
I don't get
what you don't get.

10:25.999 --> 10:27.699
I don't get
what you're not getting.

10:27.768 --> 10:29.601
No, I-- I really don't get
what you don't get.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.102
No, I don't get
what you don't get.

10:31.171 --> 10:32.837
I'm saying that
she's physically beautiful.

10:32.906 --> 10:35.106
And there's no article about her
anywhere in this magazine.

10:35.175 --> 10:37.776
She's only in the pictures.
That's all they have.

10:37.844 --> 10:38.943
Yeah.

10:44.217 --> 10:45.417
Thanks for being here.

10:45.485 --> 10:47.285
What we do is we train people

10:47.354 --> 10:49.854
to behave a certain way
around dogs.

10:49.923 --> 10:51.289
More important than
getting a dog

10:51.358 --> 10:53.525
to sit and stand
and jump and fetch

10:53.593 --> 10:56.661
is teaching people to respect
the space of dogs,

10:56.730 --> 10:58.129
to understand their language.

10:58.198 --> 11:00.198
Now everyone point at the dog.

11:00.267 --> 11:02.167
Everyone point at themselves.

11:02.235 --> 11:04.836
Everybody shrug.

11:04.905 --> 11:07.806
Adam, will you pretend
to have some seashells?

11:07.874 --> 11:10.408
And to offer it to Chico?

11:10.477 --> 11:12.644
Now sit back down again.

11:12.713 --> 11:16.414
Sandra, will you tell everyone
a story about a marching band?

11:16.483 --> 11:18.249
One of my favorite videos

11:18.318 --> 11:22.587
is when Fleetwood Mac used
the USC Trojans' marching band

11:22.656 --> 11:25.824
in their "Tusk" video.

11:25.892 --> 11:28.359
- That's your whole story?
- Yeah.

11:28.428 --> 11:29.928
Let me show you how it's done.

11:29.996 --> 11:32.997
The marching band was like--

11:39.072 --> 11:41.673
See, and now he's,
like, interested.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.274
Now I'm gonna step out
for a moment,

11:43.343 --> 11:45.510
and I'm gonna come back in.

11:45.579 --> 11:48.546
When I come back in,
do not react, okay?

11:48.615 --> 11:51.249
Do not react.

11:51.318 --> 11:53.685
You guys, I'm really sorry.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.353
All aboard!

11:55.422 --> 11:58.857
All aboard the 515
to Akron, Ohio.

11:58.925 --> 12:01.526
All aboard.

12:03.930 --> 12:05.597
Ooh, my crops--

12:05.665 --> 12:09.434
well, they just look like
a bunch of tissue pa-paper.

12:09.503 --> 12:11.402
Don't-- don't console me.

12:11.471 --> 12:14.973
Like a bunch of crippled up
old tissue paper.

12:15.041 --> 12:17.776
- Scene.
- Look how well Chico's doing.

12:27.954 --> 12:29.721
I'm telling you
that I'm from this planet.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.756
I-I feel very confident

12:31.825 --> 12:35.627
that Chico's not going to have
any interactions with aliens.

12:35.695 --> 12:39.063
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.303
How is this helping Chico?

12:45.372 --> 12:49.140
What's the difference between
when we came in and now?

12:49.209 --> 12:50.775
Chico is facing you.

12:50.844 --> 12:53.011
You have ingratiated
yourself to him, okay?

12:53.079 --> 12:54.846
So the way we do payment is

12:54.915 --> 12:57.916
it's 40 bucks each for
every person in the room, cash.

12:57.984 --> 12:59.684
But you asked me to bring
as many people as possible.

12:59.753 --> 13:00.952
Yes, I did.

13:03.318 --> 13:06.052
Hey, Fred, there's a--
a peaceful protest tonight

13:06.121 --> 13:08.121
for that bicyclist
that was hit on Williams.

13:08.189 --> 13:11.224
- Oh...
- 7:00 PM-- please wear black.

13:11.293 --> 13:14.260
- I'll post something about it.
- Uh, maybe we should go.

13:14.329 --> 13:16.195
I mean, I feel like I'm always
posting political things,

13:16.264 --> 13:18.564
but I'm not actually
participating.

13:18.633 --> 13:20.633
I know, I guess I do kind of
just, like, hashtag things

13:20.702 --> 13:22.835
without thinking about it.
You know, "RIP this",

13:22.904 --> 13:25.138
"RIP that",
"Pray for whoever."

13:25.206 --> 13:28.141
We should just post about
going to something.

13:28.209 --> 13:29.442
And actually go.

13:29.511 --> 13:30.443
Okay, but let's still
post about it.

13:30.512 --> 13:32.011
Yes.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.446
I want people to know
we're going.

13:33.515 --> 13:34.447
- Definitely.
- But it's not about us.

13:34.516 --> 13:35.515
- No.
- Cool.

13:35.583 --> 13:36.949
- Wear black, they said?
- Yeah.

13:37.018 --> 13:38.584
I don't think
they meant black tie.

13:38.653 --> 13:39.752
What, are you gonna
emcee the event?

13:39.821 --> 13:41.421
- So no tie?
- You wear this.

13:41.489 --> 13:43.122
All right, ready to go?

13:43.191 --> 13:44.757
Yeah, but I don't think
we should take the car.

13:44.826 --> 13:45.758
- Oh, of course not.
- Yeah, we need to ride bikes.

13:47.228 --> 13:48.828
So I was just wondering
if maybe you had

13:48.897 --> 13:50.830
a bike I could borrow
for the day.

13:50.899 --> 13:53.599
Yeah, sure, man.
Um, but you don't own a bike?

13:53.668 --> 13:55.268
I do.
My cousin has it right now.

13:55.337 --> 13:56.469
I've never seen you on a bike.

13:56.538 --> 13:57.970
- Oh, yeah, really?
- Mm-hmm.

13:58.039 --> 14:00.039
Hey, did you see my post
about the protest?

14:00.108 --> 14:01.374
No.

14:03.211 --> 14:05.778
- Ready?
- Yeah, I think I'm afraid.

14:05.847 --> 14:07.814
I am too. It's like,
what do we do when we get there?

14:07.882 --> 14:09.282
- Like, how do we act?
- No, I mean,

14:09.351 --> 14:10.717
I'm afraid of riding a bike.

14:14.356 --> 14:15.621
Okay, so what we'll do is

14:15.690 --> 14:16.956
we'll just a park
a few blocks away,

14:17.025 --> 14:18.224
and ride up with our bicycles.

14:18.293 --> 14:19.292
No one's gonna know
the difference.

14:19.361 --> 14:20.993
Such a good plan.

14:21.062 --> 14:23.229
Now, I know we're late,
but I haven't eaten all day.

14:23.298 --> 14:26.666
Do you think we could
maybe stop for--

14:26.735 --> 14:28.401
Two tacos, please.

14:28.470 --> 14:29.969
We're going to
the protest today.

14:30.038 --> 14:31.637
I see you're wearing
black as well.

14:31.706 --> 14:33.473
That's cool.
Solidarity.

14:33.541 --> 14:34.974
Oh, no...

14:35.043 --> 14:37.677
- Did we miss it?
- I think we did.

14:37.746 --> 14:40.313
Damn.
God, everyone's leaving.

14:40.382 --> 14:42.014
- Uh...
- Excuse me, we would love

14:42.083 --> 14:44.016
to interview you
about the protest

14:44.085 --> 14:46.419
and get your thoughts on
the whole bike movement thing.

14:46.488 --> 14:47.920
What was it like to be a part of

14:47.989 --> 14:50.223
such an historic event and rally
here in Portland?

14:50.291 --> 14:52.091
I mean, this was, like, one of
the biggest we've ever seen.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.493
Oh, huge.

14:53.561 --> 14:55.828
I lost my voice
from all the chanting.

14:55.897 --> 14:57.330
We just got out there
and got the word out.

14:57.399 --> 14:59.065
Okay, and what was the word?
What was the message?

14:59.134 --> 15:02.168
Uh, the message was just to--
to let people know that

15:02.237 --> 15:04.404
the bicyclists
and pedestrians have rights.

15:04.472 --> 15:07.507
And I am very active, uh,
with this, uh, online.

15:07.575 --> 15:10.443
You can follow me on Twitter
@CarrieIsWoke.

15:10.512 --> 15:12.245
Oh, okay, well,
thank you for your time.

15:17.318 --> 15:19.352
I think we've got everything.
Time goes so fast, doesn't it?

15:19.421 --> 15:20.453
21...

15:20.522 --> 15:22.121
- Hudson?
- Huh?

15:22.190 --> 15:24.190
Hudson, c-come on down here
for a minute.

15:24.259 --> 15:25.558
- Hi, hon.
- What's up?

15:25.627 --> 15:27.059
Hey, buddy.

15:27.128 --> 15:28.528
We just wanted to talk to you
for a moment.

15:28.596 --> 15:30.530
You're turning 21
tomorrow.

15:30.598 --> 15:33.433
And in this country,
when you turn 21,

15:33.501 --> 15:35.735
you're then allowed to drink
alcoholic beverages.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.637
A mommy drink
or a daddy drink.

15:37.705 --> 15:39.305
It's not like ice cream.
It's not like milk shakes.

15:39.374 --> 15:42.241
It's like a very--
almost bitter taste to it--

15:42.310 --> 15:44.610
- sometimes harsh.
- It can be sweet too.

15:44.679 --> 15:46.245
- Okay.
- You know, it just depends.

15:46.314 --> 15:47.980
- So this is cans of beer.
- Mm-hmm.

15:48.049 --> 15:51.250
So beer is the golden drink
that has the froth in it.

15:51.319 --> 15:53.052
That's what's hiding
in those cans.

15:53.121 --> 15:54.554
You just pull the tab up there.

15:54.622 --> 15:56.956
The tab will push
part of the metal

15:57.025 --> 15:58.891
that's ridged into the can.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.393
Don't worry, it's not
floating around in there.

16:00.462 --> 16:02.228
It's still connected.

16:02.297 --> 16:04.130
This is called a six-pack.

16:04.199 --> 16:06.132
- Why?
- Because there's six of 'em?

16:06.201 --> 16:07.567
- That's right.
- Right? Yeah.

16:07.635 --> 16:09.769
- This is wine.
- It's made from grapes.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.571
Now, what do you want?
A brand new bottle of wine?

16:11.639 --> 16:13.606
- Yes.
- No.

16:13.675 --> 16:16.576
Really old wine.
So that's red wine.

16:16.644 --> 16:17.844
- Just look through there.
- Yeah.

16:17.912 --> 16:19.812
- There's your corkscrew.
- Okay.

16:19.881 --> 16:21.314
You pull the cork out.

16:21.382 --> 16:22.915
Show me that
you can handle that.

16:22.984 --> 16:24.283
Don't do the wine,
but show me the corkscrew.

16:24.352 --> 16:25.685
It's right here.

16:25.753 --> 16:27.286
Watch your tone.

16:27.355 --> 16:29.922
Okay, vodka--
this is clear.

16:29.991 --> 16:31.791
I associate it with Russia.

16:31.860 --> 16:32.992
Russia-- brews good--

16:33.061 --> 16:34.360
vodka.

16:34.429 --> 16:35.928
And I associate it
with an ex-boyfriend.

16:35.997 --> 16:39.098
- This is for liqueurs.
- Like a brandy or a port.

16:39.167 --> 16:43.102
Another kind of drink is gin.
That gets mixed with tonic.

16:43.171 --> 16:45.338
Or juice.
Gin and juice.

16:45.406 --> 16:47.139
Hudson, this is a bar.

16:47.208 --> 16:49.275
You'll see that there's this,
like, little table here.

16:49.344 --> 16:51.944
You order from a bartender,
and they'll know how to make it.

16:52.013 --> 16:53.546
You don't have to
direct them on--

16:53.615 --> 16:55.147
"Mommy and Daddy told me that
this is how you do it."

16:55.216 --> 16:56.816
So this is
a pretty normal bar,

16:56.885 --> 16:59.285
- but there's-- there's nightclubs.
- Nightclubs?

16:59.354 --> 17:01.654
The bar is in the distance,
and people are dancing

17:01.723 --> 17:03.689
and they're--
the music's going!

17:03.758 --> 17:05.124
And yeah!

17:05.193 --> 17:07.226
You might have to shout,
"vodka soda!"

17:07.295 --> 17:09.060
And then, um, when you have
a drink in those--

17:09.130 --> 17:10.496
if you have one for your friend,

17:10.565 --> 17:11.631
you have to sort of
cut through people,

17:11.699 --> 17:12.898
so it's like--

17:15.936 --> 17:17.869
<i>Well, well, well,</i>

17:17.939 --> 17:19.338
- it's your birthday.
- Yeah.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.040
And I guess Josh is gonna
take you out.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.075
Please be careful.
I love you.

17:23.144 --> 17:24.676
Thank you, Mrs. Singer.

17:24.746 --> 17:26.811
So I was thinking
we go to the Tiki Hut,

17:26.881 --> 17:30.182
and get some tiki drinks, huh?

17:30.251 --> 17:31.884
Tiki... drinks?

17:31.953 --> 17:33.686
Yeah, you know, they put
the tropical fruits in them.

17:33.755 --> 17:36.322
They're super sweet,
really strong.

17:36.391 --> 17:37.690
You know, the tiki drinks--

17:37.759 --> 17:39.725
they put the little umbrellas
in 'em.

17:39.794 --> 17:41.861
- Tiny umbrellas.
- Yeah.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.730
Yeah, they serve 'em
in coconuts or skulls.

17:44.799 --> 17:46.165
Skulls?

17:46.234 --> 17:49.035
We can do a Mai Tai,
and get your--

17:49.103 --> 17:51.237
Oh, a Singapore Sling is good.

17:51.306 --> 17:54.407
Oh, we gotta get you
a Flaming Zombie, man.

17:54.475 --> 17:56.008
No, they didn't
explain this to me.

17:56.077 --> 17:58.010
Mom!
Help me!

17:58.079 --> 17:59.378
What's a tiki drink?

18:00.945 --> 18:03.446
I really appreciate it.

18:03.515 --> 18:04.447
- Jamie.
- Oh, hey.

18:04.516 --> 18:06.048
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:06.117 --> 18:07.550
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

18:07.619 --> 18:09.218
- You brought your dog.
- Yeah, this is Chico.

18:09.287 --> 18:11.554
- Pretty cute, right?
- Yeah, when did you get Chico?

18:11.623 --> 18:12.989
Oh, right after we talked.
You were right.

18:13.057 --> 18:14.891
I wanted a dog,
and I'm good with 'em,

18:14.959 --> 18:16.559
- and it's really fun.
- Thanks for coming.

18:16.628 --> 18:17.560
- Jamie!
- Sure.

18:17.629 --> 18:18.561
Hey, sorry.

18:18.630 --> 18:19.562
Oh, sure.

18:19.631 --> 18:21.330
Well, Chico, here we are.

18:21.399 --> 18:23.833
Maybe I'll get a drink,
and we'll get you a hotdog.

18:25.303 --> 18:27.003
Chico!

18:27.071 --> 18:29.505
No!

18:29.574 --> 18:32.975
- Ah! Chico! No!
- Ah!

18:33.044 --> 18:34.744
No.
Chico!

18:34.813 --> 18:37.079
Down!
Chico...

18:43.554 --> 18:46.222
Chico...

18:46.290 --> 18:48.891
you wanna be known as
a squirrel killer?

18:48.960 --> 18:50.893
Is that what you want, Chico?

18:50.962 --> 18:52.862
You want people to leave here
and say,

18:52.930 --> 18:54.663
"I was at a birthday party,

18:54.732 --> 18:58.534
and I saw a pit bull
kill a squirrel"?

18:58.603 --> 19:00.803
Is the squirrel the prize?

19:00.872 --> 19:03.706
At the end of this today,
if you're not smarter,

19:03.774 --> 19:07.510
stronger, faster,
then you've lost nothing.

19:07.578 --> 19:10.513
But if you are,
then you're that much tougher.

19:11.716 --> 19:14.183
Your heart-- it's a muscle.

19:14.252 --> 19:17.353
And love is what makes
the heart stronger.

19:17.421 --> 19:19.321
So it's your choice, Chico.

19:19.390 --> 19:22.324
What's the prize?
Is it love?

19:22.393 --> 19:25.227
Or is it pain?

19:25.296 --> 19:27.029
You choose.

19:43.147 --> 19:46.615
Chico?

19:46.684 --> 19:49.785
- This is crazy.
- Yeah.

19:49.854 --> 19:51.353
- I knew I could save you.
- How'd you do this?

19:51.422 --> 19:53.088
- You saved me?
- Yeah.

19:53.157 --> 19:55.591
That's incredible.
Yeah, I'm Chico.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.126
I'm Chico the dog.

19:57.195 --> 19:59.595
- This is Chico.
- Wow.

19:59.664 --> 20:01.897
Do you-- do you remember
that dog trainer

20:01.966 --> 20:03.465
you had at the house
the other day?

20:03.534 --> 20:05.935
He started speaking to me
in funny voices.

20:06.003 --> 20:07.937
Yeah, I-- I hired this trainer
off the internet.

20:08.005 --> 20:10.940
What a weirdo.
Wow.

20:11.008 --> 20:14.777
Did you see where
the squirrel went earlier?

20:14.845 --> 20:16.579
- I don't know.
- You didn't see it?

20:16.647 --> 20:18.547
- No.
- Well, I have to go find that.

20:18.616 --> 20:20.616
I'm sorry.

20:20.685 --> 20:23.819
I'm gonna go.

20:23.888 --> 20:27.389
He's going after a squirrel.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.292
People have-- so many prejudice
against them.

20:30.361 --> 20:33.729
You know,
there's a lot of, uh--

20:33.798 --> 20:35.798
they just say, "Oh, they're--
they're aggressive,

20:35.866 --> 20:39.001
and they're filthy," you know,
but-- yeah,

20:39.070 --> 20:41.904
they're just misunderstood
miracles, you know.

20:41.973 --> 20:43.906
'Cause-- four rats.

20:43.975 --> 20:46.075
They aren't born that way,
you know.

20:46.143 --> 20:47.843
It's how people treat four rats.

20:47.912 --> 20:52.248
Would you be interested
in four rats?

21:06.864 --> 21:08.764
If you ever go to a museum,
you'll see an--

21:08.833 --> 21:11.433
- even an Egyptian in the museum.
- Like--

21:11.502 --> 21:12.768
- This.
- Yeah.

21:12.837 --> 21:14.336
You can show off
to your friends,

21:14.405 --> 21:16.171
and go, "They're drinking
alcoholic drinks."

21:16.240 --> 21:17.840
The very beginning of time
with the Egyptians--

21:17.908 --> 21:18.841
- Mm-hmm.
- That's what they're doing.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.111
Everyone was serving
everyone else back then.
