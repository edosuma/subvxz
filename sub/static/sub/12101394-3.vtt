12:20.198 --> 12:21.450
and there was Ming.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.954
And he put his phone on

12:26.037 --> 12:29.458
and did a little
solo flash mob dance.

12:29.541 --> 12:33.503
And it ended with a banner
he had in his hands.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.007
"Will you go to the prom
with me?"

12:41.178 --> 12:42.387
I fainted.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.640
Yeah. I fainted.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.519
Well, Ming picked me up
from the ground,

12:49.603 --> 12:51.938
and when I came to
and saw him, I...

12:52.022 --> 12:53.607
I just laughed.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.777
He didn't laugh,
he was petrified.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.738
Here he was,
the boy of my dreams,

12:59.821 --> 13:02.824
asking me to go to
the school dance with him.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.411
-TYM: That sounds wonderful.

13:06.495 --> 13:07.913
Like a wonderful memory.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.500
-It was.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.585
[chuckling]

13:17.589 --> 13:19.216
I said no, of course.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.262
-TYM: What?

13:24.346 --> 13:28.308
-Yes, I told him thank you
but I was busy.

13:28.391 --> 13:29.726
I told him I had to
stay at home

13:29.809 --> 13:32.687
and help my grandmother
with something or other.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.732
-TYM: Why?
Why would you say no?

13:35.815 --> 13:38.527
-Oh, I knew what
the kids would say,

13:38.610 --> 13:40.820
I knew what they would
make of him.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.574
I mean,
it would have been nice

13:44.658 --> 13:46.952
for them to see me with him.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.288
It would have been nice
to be seen.

13:51.873 --> 13:55.293
But he was so nice and...

13:55.377 --> 13:56.503
[sighs]

13:56.586 --> 13:59.256
And so I said no.

13:59.339 --> 14:03.343
And I thanked him
and I went back inside.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.720
And I curled up in
my mom's sweater,

14:05.804 --> 14:06.972
and I cried.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.561
I mean, honestly,
I don't think he even

14:12.644 --> 14:14.729
really wanted to go to
the dance with me.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.607
I think he was just
a nice boy who felt badly

14:17.691 --> 14:19.776
for a quiet girl
who stopped dancing,

14:19.859 --> 14:21.903
and I...

14:21.987 --> 14:23.863
Well, I didn't want to be
a bother.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.118
So on prom night,

14:28.201 --> 14:29.536
me and granny watched
an old movie.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.083
That was "Speed 2."

14:35.166 --> 14:37.168
Yes.

14:37.252 --> 14:41.214
With that
wonderful screen star,

14:41.298 --> 14:42.507
Sandra Bullock.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.718
Do you remember her?

14:44.801 --> 14:46.052
She's so funny.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.345
Beautiful.

14:50.015 --> 14:53.101
It was 11 at night and
Granny snoring on the couch,

14:53.184 --> 14:54.477
and there's
a knock on the door,

14:54.561 --> 14:56.980
and I answer it and it's...

14:57.063 --> 14:59.357
Ming...

14:59.441 --> 15:03.570
standing there in his tuxedo
and he looked so handsome.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.113
And he looked so kind.

15:05.196 --> 15:08.033
And he looked a little drunk.
[chuckles]

15:08.116 --> 15:09.743
And the moon...

15:11.953 --> 15:15.415
The moon was
shining down on him.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.250
Like out of a movie.

15:17.334 --> 15:21.880
Like an alien ship was
beaming down right on him

15:21.963 --> 15:23.256
illuminating him,

15:23.340 --> 15:26.968
as if maybe the moon
had taken my wish

15:27.052 --> 15:28.845
all those years ago
about my dad

15:28.928 --> 15:31.890
and just got to hearing
about it all these years later

15:31.973 --> 15:33.767
and couldn't
get to it in time and...

15:33.850 --> 15:35.602
and couldn't do
anything about it now,

15:35.685 --> 15:39.898
so it tried to make up for it,
and it brought him here, Ming.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.737
And Ming said the whole night
he was thinking about me.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.406
[laughing]

16:00.502 --> 16:02.796
And...

16:02.879 --> 16:05.882
Anyway, he leans in
for a kiss, and I...

16:05.965 --> 16:08.885
adventure ahead...
[chuckles]

16:08.968 --> 16:11.054
I kissed him back.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.181
In the moonlight.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.559
And as soon as
I pulled away,

16:16.643 --> 16:18.978
I ran back inside
and shut the door.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.522
And I danced.

16:28.697 --> 16:29.739
[sighs]

16:31.700 --> 16:33.785
He called me right after
but I didn't pick up,

16:33.868 --> 16:37.497
I was too scared,
you know?

16:37.580 --> 16:38.665
Too scared.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.210
And I went to bed...

16:42.293 --> 16:46.047
I went to bed
dreaming about that kiss.

16:46.131 --> 16:49.134
I thought about it
every night.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.095
Day after night,
night after day.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.558
Ming called again
a few times that week,

16:56.641 --> 16:58.768
but I...

16:58.852 --> 17:01.020
Oh, I was too nervous
to answer.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.525
I guess I...

17:05.608 --> 17:08.820
Well, I just didn't want him to
say it was wrong or a mistake,

17:08.903 --> 17:10.530
or... or that he
didn't want to give me

17:10.613 --> 17:14.200
the wrong idea, you know?

17:14.284 --> 17:16.870
I was trying to muster
the courage.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.330
I was trying to muster it up.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.752
And I was going to call back,
I was going to call and say

17:23.835 --> 17:26.588
what a lovely kiss that was.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.299
And maybe we should
do it again.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.595
And every night
I thought about that kiss

17:33.678 --> 17:35.138
and how full it made me,

17:35.221 --> 17:37.307
and how I was going to
call him back,

17:37.390 --> 17:39.726
and what I was going to say
and...

17:42.729 --> 17:45.648
And then one day,
I'm standing in the market,

17:45.732 --> 17:48.109
and I see him there.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.652
And I smiled.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.115
And he sees me
and he smiles back.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.701
And I wave.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.663
And he waves back.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.835
And then we just
drift together...

18:05.919 --> 18:09.047
in the freezer aisle
in front of the fish sticks.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.885
And then a woman with
the curliest hair I've ever seen

18:13.968 --> 18:16.596
puts her hand on his shoulder.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.557
"This is my wife, Carol,"
Ming says.

18:19.641 --> 18:22.227
And then two little kids...
No, three little kids,

18:22.310 --> 18:25.230
two boys and a girl,
grab him by the leg.

18:25.313 --> 18:30.276
"Dad, Dad, can we have
Chocolate Hobnobs, please?"

18:31.986 --> 18:33.196
And I looked down.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.784
My hands looked different.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.539
I have these wrinkles now.

18:44.374 --> 18:48.545
My legs have
varicose veins and...

18:48.628 --> 18:51.756
and I'm, um...
a little bit lumpy in parts,

18:51.840 --> 18:55.885
and stretchy and flaky and...

18:55.969 --> 18:57.804
and I have
a few gray hairs and...

18:59.806 --> 19:02.183
And I look in the freezer window
where the fish sticks are

19:02.267 --> 19:06.020
and I... I see myself
and suddenly...

19:06.104 --> 19:08.982
I'm 51.

19:09.065 --> 19:12.318
And he is, too, and I...

19:12.402 --> 19:16.322
suppose I'd, uh...
I just lost track of time.

19:30.879 --> 19:33.840
He introduced me to her,
his wife, Carol.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.302
She seemed uninterested in me.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.892
If she only knew
how much he meant to me,

19:43.975 --> 19:46.853
I think she might have been
more interested in me.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.609
If only Ming knew
how much he meant to me.

19:54.777 --> 19:58.156
If only I knew
how much I meant to me.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.826
And I thought...

20:01.910 --> 20:03.328
what if those were our kids?

20:05.330 --> 20:09.792
I thought...
I would have been a great mom.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.336
And I thought...

20:11.419 --> 20:14.380
if I died, my kids would have
kept my sweater,

20:14.464 --> 20:18.009
and curled up with it
when things got hard

20:18.092 --> 20:19.594
or they got gassy.

20:19.677 --> 20:23.056
And I thought, oh, I...

20:23.139 --> 20:27.852
I really should have
picked up his call.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.104
And I thought,
why do I always think

20:30.188 --> 20:32.023
I'm going to be a bother?

20:34.025 --> 20:39.489
And I thought, why am I
so scared of being seen?

20:45.119 --> 20:48.039
At least when I was younger,
I had some semblance of choice

20:48.122 --> 20:51.876
in the matter of
my invisibility.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.296
But now,
being of a certain age,

20:55.380 --> 20:58.466
to put it politely...
[chuckles]

20:58.549 --> 21:01.010
Well...

21:01.094 --> 21:04.305
that's what scares me the most.

21:04.389 --> 21:05.598
That I gave up
all those good years

21:05.682 --> 21:07.600
because I was scared,

21:07.684 --> 21:12.063
and now I'm here and I'm
losing my say in the matter.

21:13.356 --> 21:16.275
Old age is a strange,
blunt foe.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.195
And it fights dirty.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.656
It isn't fair.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.413
At first, I started
noticing it years ago

21:28.496 --> 21:32.583
when I turned 64,
this matter of "old."

21:34.961 --> 21:36.879
Little things.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.382
But little things add up.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.011
It was the bus ride back from
the funeral

21:43.094 --> 21:46.639
just a couple of months ago
that did it.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.933
I was waiting.
I was on the bus for some time,

21:49.017 --> 21:52.228
and I was waiting for my stop,
and an hour goes by,

21:52.311 --> 21:53.730
and then two,

21:53.813 --> 21:56.691
until I'm the last one
on the bus.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.901
Just me and the driver.

22:00.820 --> 22:04.323
I look out the window and
I don't recognize the streets.

22:04.407 --> 22:06.576
And finally, the bus
turns into a parking lot,

22:06.659 --> 22:08.369
the bus depot.

22:08.453 --> 22:09.704
The bus stops,

22:09.787 --> 22:13.332
and the engine cuts
and the lights turn off.

22:13.416 --> 22:16.627
And I didn't even say anything.
I just sat there.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.798
I just sat there until
the driver realized,

22:20.882 --> 22:25.344
he... he was walking off the bus
when he noticed me.

22:25.428 --> 22:28.222
He jumped like I was a ghost.

22:28.306 --> 22:31.142
"Oh! Didn't see you there,"
he said.

22:34.729 --> 22:37.356
I didn't see you there.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.114
How unfair.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.825
I paid my fare.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.369
Took my seat.

22:50.453 --> 22:53.372
But how unfair not to see me.

22:53.456 --> 22:56.918
How unfair not to know that
I have things inside of me, too.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.920
I... I have things I feel

22:59.003 --> 23:00.963
and I say
and I think and I know.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.340
I... I have funny jokes
sometimes.

23:02.423 --> 23:04.550
Really funny jokes.

23:04.634 --> 23:07.136
Jokes that the late hosts
would use on their shows

23:07.220 --> 23:08.971
if they knew them.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.182
Yeah, I'm bold in that way.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.518
And I'm wickedly smart.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.561
I mean, sometimes
I think of things, you know,

23:15.645 --> 23:18.022
inventions and things
that if I had the time

23:18.106 --> 23:19.357
or the money and...

23:20.691 --> 23:24.529
And, heck,
I'm sexy in here, too.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.405
I'm sexy.

23:28.074 --> 23:31.202
I could put on a red lip,
I could put on some rouge.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.664
I could dance...

23:34.747 --> 23:37.375
and love and excite and need,

23:37.458 --> 23:40.545
and deserve and exist and...

23:40.628 --> 23:42.588
And I am a person.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.344
That's what I wanted to say
to him;

23:48.427 --> 23:50.388
to the bus driver
on that cold bus

23:50.471 --> 23:52.723
in that cold bus depot.

23:54.350 --> 23:57.645
It's what I wanted to say
but I just said...

23:57.728 --> 24:00.064
[scoffs]

24:00.148 --> 24:03.276
"I'm sorry. My fault.

24:03.359 --> 24:06.863
I should have been
more 'seeable.'"

24:06.946 --> 24:10.324
And he told me not to worry,
that these things happen.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.704
But why do these things happen?

24:14.787 --> 24:18.124
Why am I scared of
automatic doors,

24:18.207 --> 24:20.835
and deli counters
and the bus?

24:28.551 --> 24:31.095
And so that night...

24:31.179 --> 24:35.391
that night when I got home...

24:35.474 --> 24:38.978
I realized that if I was
destined to disappear,

24:39.061 --> 24:42.315
I was going to do it
on my own terms.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.613
Adventure ahead.

24:51.574 --> 24:55.453
So I sat on my bed
thinking about how to end it.

24:56.954 --> 24:58.247
But before I did,

24:58.331 --> 25:00.583
I remembered I had
fruit in the fridge.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.960
Mm.

25:03.044 --> 25:05.379
And it was supposed to go bad
the next day.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.924
So I went into the kitchen,

25:08.007 --> 25:11.510
I took the fruit from
the refrigerator to eat it.

25:11.594 --> 25:17.308
And there I ate the most
delicious strawberry

25:17.391 --> 25:19.936
I've ever eaten
in my whole life.

25:20.019 --> 25:23.606
And I sat there for a while
at the kitchen table...

25:23.689 --> 25:27.318
Well, no, for hours,
actually, really,

25:27.401 --> 25:29.028
thinking about the strawberry.

25:31.948 --> 25:35.701
And it grew quiet so
I turned the television on.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.454
And it was
"The Hologram Singer."

25:38.537 --> 25:41.916
And then,
this commercial came on.

25:41.999 --> 25:45.211
"Seniors wanted."

25:45.294 --> 25:47.255
[laughs]

25:47.338 --> 25:49.298
Right there on the television.

Why did I apply?

26:02.103 --> 26:05.022
I lied to you before,
you know.

26:05.106 --> 26:07.024
It wasn't because
I wanted adventure.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.780
[sighs]

26:12.863 --> 26:15.324
It was because I felt like
the kind of person

26:15.408 --> 26:17.410
that if you gave
everyone on Earth

26:17.493 --> 26:23.374
a number a the deli counter,
every single person...

26:23.457 --> 26:25.126
there wouldn't be
one left for me.

26:27.878 --> 26:31.090
And I thought that
maybe somewhere

26:31.173 --> 26:35.469
in the farthest reaches of
the universe...

26:35.553 --> 26:37.680
I would finally have a spot.

26:40.224 --> 26:45.730
I would finally be counted.

-TYM: I think Ming wanted to
go to the prom with you.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.457
And to kiss you.

27:04.540 --> 27:05.708
And to have you
pick up his call

27:05.791 --> 27:08.002
so he could ask you on a date.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.712
And to one day marry you.

27:11.589 --> 27:12.798
I see you, Peg.

27:14.342 --> 27:17.011
-And you don't even have eyes.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.597
-TYM: I don't need eyes.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.224
There's more of you to see
than anyone I've seen

27:22.308 --> 27:25.353
or known or heard
in my whole existence.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.065

for that.

-From where we're heading.

-Maybe I... I could call Ming,

28:00.805 --> 28:02.681
ask him if he'd like to
get dinner one night,

28:02.765 --> 28:05.559
or see a movie and...

28:05.643 --> 28:07.186
and maybe I could dance.

28:07.269 --> 28:10.314
Like I used to
before I stopped.

28:12.566 --> 28:15.152
And maybe I could be myself
again.

that I've always been

Well, maybe I'll start.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.549
Maybe today is a new day.

28:36.632 --> 28:39.844
I mean, 71 isn't so old
when you think about it.

71 isn't so old
from where I'm sitting.

So, starting today,
I'm gonna be a whole new me.

A whole new Peg.

to do Peg, as they say.

turn this thing around, Tym?
