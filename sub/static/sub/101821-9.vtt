Numbers look right to me.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.440
<i>Good choice.</i>

10:07.481 --> 10:09.525
<i>Hear me call your name</i>

10:12.278 --> 10:14.030
<i>Listen, darling</i>

10:14.071 --> 10:16.532
<i>We've stolen from one</i>
of the largest crime families

10:16.574 --> 10:17.408
<i>in Chicago?</i>

10:17.450 --> 10:19.910
<i>Seems like it.</i>
Yeah.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.582
<i>All right, girls.</i>

10:24.624 --> 10:26.626
<i>-No!</i>
-Amy, no.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.003
<i>Unacceptable.</i>
We do not act like that.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.130
<i>-Here, just watch a movie.</i>
-No.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.548
<i>We want to go to school.</i>

10:32.590 --> 10:34.383
<i>Guys, I want you to go</i>
to school, too.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.343
<i>I really do.</i>

10:35.384 --> 10:37.136
<i>But I told you</i>
there's no school today.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.179
<i>It's a teacher work day.</i>

10:38.220 --> 10:41.057
<i>Which is so great 'cause</i>
it's a Daddy work day, too.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.058
<i>I want Mommy.</i>

10:42.099 --> 10:43.225
<i>Yeah, I want Mommy too, okay?</i>

10:43.267 --> 10:44.685
<i>But she's not here.</i>
She's in Kentucky.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.563
<i>Please just watch a movie.</i>

10:47.605 --> 10:48.648
<i>What's V doing in Kentucky?</i>

10:48.689 --> 10:50.274
<i>[Kev sighs]</i>
She's helping her mom move.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.401
<i>She left you</i>
in charge of the girls?

10:52.443 --> 10:54.487
<i>Yeah, she left me</i>
in charge of the girls.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.447
<i>Shut up.</i>

10:56.489 --> 10:57.948
<i>Where's Tommy?</i>

10:57.990 --> 10:59.533
<i>I don't know.</i>
At work, I guess.

10:59.575 --> 11:00.618
<i>Why?</i>

11:00.660 --> 11:02.787
<i>It just freaks me out</i>
when you're here by yourself.

11:02.828 --> 11:07.124
<i>Could I get a shot of Jamie,</i>
please?

11:07.166 --> 11:10.795
<i>Hey, Frank.</i>
It's me, Kevin.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.963
<i>Hey, Kevin.</i>
It's me, Frank.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.299
<i>Why are we talking like</i>
we're on the phone?

11:15.341 --> 11:17.468
<i>Oh, I just didn't know</i>
if you remembered me.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.970
<i>I'm not drunk yet.</i>

11:21.597 --> 11:24.266
<i>-What's with the notebook?</i>
-This?

11:24.308 --> 11:28.312
<i>-This is the plan.</i>
-What's the plan?

11:29.897 --> 11:31.107
<i>A heist.</i>

11:31.148 --> 11:33.943
<i>I'm putting the gang</i>
back together for one last job.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.319
Cool.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.113
<i>You used to be a thief</i>
or something?

11:37.154 --> 11:38.823
<i>One of the best.</i>

11:38.864 --> 11:41.534
<i>You might've heard of one</i>
or two of our escapades.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.911
<i>The Purolator heist?</i>

11:43.953 --> 11:48.082
<i>Elizabeth Stewart Gardner</i>
Museum?

11:48.124 --> 11:48.916
<i>No.</i>

11:48.958 --> 11:52.044
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>
Best of luck.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.797
<i>Yeah, you go get 'em.</i>
Cheers.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.882
<i>Thanks, boys.</i>

11:56.924 --> 11:58.801
<i>Well, I'm outta here.</i>

11:58.843 --> 12:02.471
<i>Don't mention anything</i>
to anybody

12:02.513 --> 12:04.390
<i>about the heist.</i>

12:04.432 --> 12:05.975
<i>Discretion is vital.</i>

12:06.016 --> 12:09.103
<i>I don't know</i>
what you're talking about.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.104
<i>I just told you.</i>

12:10.146 --> 12:13.607
<i>Yeah, Frank, I'm pretending</i>
that I don't know.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.109
<i>Oh, got it.</i>

12:17.069 --> 12:19.739
<i>-Frank?</i>
-What?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.240
<i>Your shot.</i>

12:21.282 --> 12:22.867
<i>What?</i>

12:24.952 --> 12:26.454
<i>Oh.</i>

12:26.495 --> 12:28.581
<i>[chuckles softly]</i>
Mm.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.922
<i>How you doin'?</i>

12:37.965 --> 12:41.260
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

12:50.311 --> 12:52.188
Did you find anything
for Terry to wear?

12:52.229 --> 12:54.607
<i>Shirt with a collar.</i>
Better than nothing.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.986
<i>[Ian]</i>
Where'd all the Milkoviches go?

12:59.028 --> 12:59.862
<i>They hauled ass.</i>

12:59.904 --> 13:03.282
<i>Took all the fuckin' guns,</i>
ammo, TV.

13:07.828 --> 13:11.248
<i>-Who's Rachel?</i>
-Hell if I know.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.543
<i>-[tape ripping]</i>
-Hey, hey.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.962
<i>Little fuckin' respect, please?</i>

13:17.004 --> 13:18.422
<i>Don't you wanna know</i>
what's inside?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.257
<i>-It's for Rachel.</i>
Yeah.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.427
<i>How are we gonna know who</i>
Rachel is if we don't open it?

13:28.265 --> 13:30.684
Oh, fuck.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.448
<i>Jesus.</i>
Look at Terry.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.659
<i>I guess that's Rachel, huh?</i>

13:46.700 --> 13:48.536
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:48.577 --> 13:52.122
<i>Must've been one of</i>
his old neo-Nazi girlfriends.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.503
<i>There's an address in here.</i>

13:59.463 --> 14:00.714
<i>You think maybe</i>
we should take it to her--

14:00.756 --> 14:01.757
<i>No.</i>

14:01.799 --> 14:02.758
<i>-Hell no.</i>
Come on.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.468
<i>It's what my dad</i>
would've wanted, asshole.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.554
<i>How do we know</i>
she still lives there?

14:06.595 --> 14:07.680
<i>Or if she's even alive?</i>

14:07.721 --> 14:11.183
<i>We should at least try</i>
and find the bitch.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.519
<i>This could be my mom.</i>

14:18.274 --> 14:20.025
<i>[Nurse]</i>
Doing an STD panel today?

14:20.067 --> 14:21.026
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:21.068 --> 14:23.445
<i>-Any particular reason?</i>
Uh, yeah.

14:23.487 --> 14:26.782
<i>I think my stupid brother</i>
gave me an STD.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.450
<i>You had sex with your brother?</i>

14:28.492 --> 14:31.412
<i>Oh, my God, no.</i>
Jesus.

14:31.453 --> 14:34.790
<i>What would happen if I did?</i>
Would he go to jail?

14:34.832 --> 14:37.543
<i>I'd have to report it.</i>
Incest is illegal in Illinois.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.963
<i>He'd probably spend</i>
two to five years in jail.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.381
<i>Oh.</i>
It's temping...

14:42.423 --> 14:44.717
<i>[groans softly]</i>
But extreme.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.552
<i>I just want to stay</i>
in my house.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.387
<i>Honey, why are you here?</i>

14:48.429 --> 14:50.848
<i>I had unprotected sex</i>
with a gay dude.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.808
<i>What does that have to do</i>
with your brother?

14:52.850 --> 14:55.477
<i>Well, he wants to sell</i>
the house we grew up in.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.229
<i>I don't wanna sell the house.</i>

14:57.271 --> 14:59.023
<i>I may have overreacted</i>
a little bit

14:59.064 --> 15:01.191
<i>and gotten drunk</i>

15:01.233 --> 15:06.113
<i>and had unprotected sex in</i>
the back of a skanky-ass bar.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.115
<i>You think your brother planned</i>
to sell the house

15:08.157 --> 15:12.494
<i>so you'd have unprotected sex</i>
with a stranger and get an STD?

15:12.536 --> 15:14.246
<i>Yes.</i>
AIDS.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.915
<i>I doubt you have AIDS.</i>

15:15.956 --> 15:16.999
<i>You probably don't have</i>
anything,

15:17.041 --> 15:18.834
<i>but I am gonna give you</i>
a penicillin shot

15:18.876 --> 15:20.127
<i>just to be safe.</i>

15:20.169 --> 15:21.378
<i>Thanks.</i>

15:25.424 --> 15:26.592
<i>Okay.</i>

15:29.470 --> 15:31.221
<i>Jesus.</i>

15:31.263 --> 15:32.598
<i>I need you</i>
to pull your jeans down,

15:32.640 --> 15:34.099
<i>bend over slightly.</i>

15:36.852 --> 15:38.938
<i>I'm gonna fuckin' kill Lip.</i>

15:45.152 --> 15:47.154
<i>-Gallagher.</i>
-Sergeant Stamps.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.698
<i>I have reassigned you</i>
to the eviction unit.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.367
<i>You mean I'm already off Vice?</i>

15:51.408 --> 15:53.911
<i>You wrecked a Ferrari.</i>
Eviction unit.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.246
<i>What, you mean like kicking</i>
people out of their houses?

15:56.288 --> 15:57.831
<i>No, that is the Sheriff's job.</i>

15:57.873 --> 16:01.877
<i>You just show up and provide</i>
armed support if needed.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.379
<i>Don't overthink it, Gallagher.</i>

16:03.420 --> 16:06.590
<i>Officer Tipping knows</i>
what to do.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.968
<i>Officer Tipping?</i>
You're back?

16:09.009 --> 16:10.803
<i>Carl.</i>

16:12.304 --> 16:13.555
<i>I can't imagine</i>
what you've been through

16:13.597 --> 16:15.391
<i>and I'm sorry, but it's okay.</i>

16:15.432 --> 16:19.979
<i>I'm right here.</i>

16:21.772 --> 16:23.941
<i>Insurance fraud</i>
would've been okay.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.317
<i>White collar prison,</i>

16:25.359 --> 16:28.195
<i>grow organic vegetables</i>
in a community garden,

16:28.237 --> 16:30.114
<i>maybe learn a craft.</i>

16:30.155 --> 16:32.825
<i>But no, we had to steal</i>
from the mafia.

16:32.866 --> 16:33.826
<i>When they find out,</i>

16:33.867 --> 16:34.910
<i>they're gonna chop</i>
our dicks off

16:34.952 --> 16:36.495
<i>and stuff 'em in our mouths.</i>

16:36.537 --> 16:38.580
<i>Only cartels do that.</i>

16:38.622 --> 16:41.125
<i>Toss us out of helicopters</i>
in the lake.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.501
<i>Still cartels.</i>

16:42.543 --> 16:43.752
<i>Why don't we just give them</i>
the parts back?

16:43.794 --> 16:45.504
<i>They don't want the parts,</i>
okay?

16:45.546 --> 16:46.547
<i>It's insurance fraud.</i>

16:46.588 --> 16:47.589
<i>If they find the parts,</i>

16:47.631 --> 16:48.841
<i>the insurance company</i>
won't pay them.

16:48.882 --> 16:51.093
<i>-Fuck the parts.</i>

16:51.135 --> 16:53.262
<i>Look, I gotta get back to the</i>
house before David shows up.

16:53.303 --> 16:56.390
<i>-Can you drop me off?</i>
-They're back.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.850
<i>-Who?</i>
-Black SUV.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.019
<i>Been following me</i>
since last week.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.478
<i>Shit.</i>
Really?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.397
<i>Thought you said</i>
they didn't care.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.857
<i>Could be a coincidence.</i>

17:04.898 --> 17:06.108
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.901
<i>-Making a run for it.</i>
No, no, no!

17:07.943 --> 17:11.822
<i>-[tires screeching]</i>
Fuck!

17:11.864 --> 17:14.158
<i>Still think it's a coincidence?</i>

17:14.199 --> 17:15.993
<i>Probably not.</i>

17:18.162 --> 17:19.788
<i>Liam Gallagher.</i>

17:22.624 --> 17:24.710
<i>I'm trying to be proactive,</i>
you know?

17:24.752 --> 17:25.711
<i>Have a plan in place</i>

17:25.753 --> 17:27.921
<i>so I don't end up homeless</i>
and on the street.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.381
<i>So you currently live</i>
in a home?

17:29.423 --> 17:31.300
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>
-Who do you live with?

17:31.341 --> 17:33.093
<i>My family.</i>

17:33.135 --> 17:34.762
<i>Are you being</i>
physically abused?

17:34.803 --> 17:36.180
<i>No, ma'am.</i>

17:36.221 --> 17:38.223
<i>Uh, is there food, electricity?</i>

17:38.265 --> 17:41.769
<i>There is, but I expect things</i>
to take a turn for the worst.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.520
<i>Why?</i>

17:43.562 --> 17:44.646
<i>My brother wants</i>
to sell the house.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.899
<i>And when he does,</i>
I'll end up homeless.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.401
<i>Well, do you have siblings</i>
you can live with?

17:49.443 --> 17:50.861
<i>They don't know</i>
where they're living, either.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.655
<i>It's every man for themselves.</i>
And two females.

17:53.697 --> 17:56.075
<i>Uh--who is your legal guardian?</i>

17:56.116 --> 17:57.701
<i>I don't think I have one.</i>

17:57.743 --> 17:58.869
Sorry,

17:58.911 --> 18:02.164
<i>but unless you're abused</i>
or actually homeless,

18:02.206 --> 18:03.332
<i>I can't help you.</i>

18:08.754 --> 18:10.756
<i>Adoption fair.</i>
What about that?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.383
<i>That's for kids who already</i>
live in group homes.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.219
<i>Then put me in a group home.</i>

18:15.260 --> 18:18.263
<i>Group homes are</i>
for foster kids.

18:18.305 --> 18:19.515
<i>Ronald McDonald's house?</i>

18:19.556 --> 18:21.642
<i>For families who need</i>
a place to stay

18:21.683 --> 18:24.394
<i>when their child</i>
is in the hospital.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.272
<i>Hospital.</i>
Hadn't thought of that.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.901
<i>You're not sick or abused.</i>
You're lucky.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.278
<i>Why don't you think about that?</i>

18:38.700 --> 18:39.701
<i>So this is the job?</i>

18:39.743 --> 18:40.994
<i>Just watching people</i>
get evicted?

18:41.036 --> 18:44.289
<i>The only thing that is</i>
permanent is impermanence.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.165
<i>What?</i>

18:45.207 --> 18:46.583
<i>Change is the only constant,</i>
Carl.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.378
<i>-I know that now.</i>
-Know what?

18:49.419 --> 18:51.171
<i>You like hushpuppies, Carl?</i>

18:51.213 --> 18:53.173
<i>-What?</i>
-Hushpuppies.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.591
<i>Man, I love hushpuppies.</i>

18:54.633 --> 18:58.512
<i>Dino's fries them in ham hock.</i>
Big as baseballs.

18:58.554 --> 18:59.763
<i>Yeah.</i>
Sounds awesome.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.598
<i>After this, what do you say</i>
we head over there for lunch,

19:01.640 --> 19:03.600
<i>have ourselves</i>
a little celebration?

19:03.642 --> 19:04.893
<i>What are we celebrating?</i>

19:04.935 --> 19:06.770
<i>Illumination.</i>

19:06.812 --> 19:07.688
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

19:07.729 --> 19:08.897
<i>But the last time</i>
we celebrated something,

19:08.939 --> 19:09.898
<i>you had a heart attack.</i>

19:09.940 --> 19:11.483
<i>Best thing</i>
that ever happened to me.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.194
<i>-You shit your pants.</i>
-All part of the journey.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.488
<i>-You need to leave.</i>
-Come on, man.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.490
<i>Don't do this.</i>
My girlfriend just had a baby.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.617
<i>Sorry, sir, I have</i>
a court order to enforce.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.412
<i>Can't he give the guy a break?</i>
Let him off with a warning?

19:23.453 --> 19:24.621
<i>Man's got a baby.</i>

19:24.663 --> 19:25.706
<i>Giving him a break</i>

19:25.747 --> 19:27.833
<i>would be depriving him</i>

<i>Let me go talk to him.</i>
He's one of us.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.843
<i>You know, the old me would've</i>
said, "Yes, go talk to him."

19:37.885 --> 19:39.303
<i>But this guy's on a path, Carl.</i>

19:39.344 --> 19:43.056
<i>This is his destiny.</i>
Whom are we to interfere?

19:43.098 --> 19:44.892
<i>-We're cops.</i>
-Are we?

19:44.933 --> 19:45.851
<i>Yes, we are.</i>

19:45.893 --> 19:48.103
<i>Or are we human beings</i>
in cops' clothing?

19:48.145 --> 19:49.813
<i>That's literally what cops are.</i>

19:49.855 --> 19:51.231
<i>Fuck outta here, pig!</i>
Fuck!

19:51.273 --> 19:52.983
<i>-Shit.</i>
-That's a shame.

-Frank Gallagher.

<i>Quelle surprise,</i>

<i>-You look great, kid.</i>
-Thanks.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.200
<i>I wish I could say the same</i>
about you.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.117
<i>What happened?</i>

20:44.159 --> 20:46.078
<i>[Johnny]</i>
I got old is what happened.

20:46.119 --> 20:48.747
<i>I haven't seen you in what,</i>
30 years?

20:48.789 --> 20:50.707

Has it been that long?

'Fraid so, old friend.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.341
<i>Good news.</i>

20:59.383 --> 21:01.885
<i>I'm getting a crew</i>
back together.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.303
<i>Are they alive?</i>

21:03.345 --> 21:07.182
<i>One last heist.</i>
You remember ICOE?

21:07.224 --> 21:08.475
<i>Great plan.</i>

21:08.517 --> 21:09.685
<i>Well, I got it all right here.</i>

21:09.726 --> 21:12.312
<i>Every detail.</i>
You in?

21:12.354 --> 21:15.232
<i>I need a good wheelman.</i>

21:15.274 --> 21:17.609
<i>I can't drive anymore, kid.</i>

21:17.651 --> 21:20.153
<i>I can't walk.</i>
I can barely see.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.240
<i>That's crazy.</i>
It's like riding a bike.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.450
<i>It's not.</i>
It's like driving a car.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.245
<i>Which I cannot do.</i>

21:28.287 --> 21:31.707
<i>Uh, I hear you.</i>

21:31.748 --> 21:33.834
<i>Maybe you'll sit this one out,</i>
then?

21:33.875 --> 21:37.462
<i>-I sit everything out.</i>

21:41.008 --> 21:45.012
<i>-[Johnny sighs]</i>
-Next time?

21:45.053 --> 21:46.680
<i>Sure thing, Kid.</i>

21:46.722 --> 21:49.850
<i>You know where to find me.</i>

21:49.891 --> 21:51.727
Girl,
I'm excited about Louisville.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.937
<i>Where does this path lead to?</i>

21:53.979 --> 21:55.397
<i>Bourbon.</i>

21:55.439 --> 21:57.524
<i>They call this a nature trail.</i>

21:57.566 --> 21:59.526
<i>Leads us right</i>
to the distilleries.

21:59.568 --> 22:02.654
<i>See, they planted different</i>
plants and wildflowers

22:02.696 --> 22:05.490
<i>along this pathway</i>
and then they labeled them.

22:05.532 --> 22:06.491
<i>Why?</i>

22:06.533 --> 22:09.703
<i>Okay, look.</i>
This one is cyclobin presidium.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.122
<i>Ooh!</i>
Middle East, Mediterranean.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.751
<i>This is wonderful.</i>
Look how beautiful it is.

22:15.792 --> 22:16.626
<i>It's a sidewalk.</i>

22:16.668 --> 22:18.086
<i>They have these</i>
in Chicago, too.

22:18.128 --> 22:21.173
<i>Well, I think</i>
Gemma and Amy would like it.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.507
<i>Why?</i>

22:22.549 --> 22:24.718
<i>Talk to Kev?</i>
How they doing?

22:24.760 --> 22:26.678
<i>I'm sure they're doing fine.</i>

22:26.720 --> 22:27.888
<i>Mm.</i>

22:30.432 --> 22:33.352
Amy, Gemma,
stay out of the edibles.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.228
<i>Please don't touch that.</i>
Thank you.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.313
<i>Kev, Kev, another beer?</i>

22:36.355 --> 22:37.773
Yeah, another beer.
Got you.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.232
<i>[Amy and Gemma]</i>
Candy, candy, candy!

22:39.274 --> 22:40.150
<i>No, no.</i>

22:40.192 --> 22:41.234
<i>Candy, candy, candy!</i>

22:41.276 --> 22:44.237
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>
That candy is for adults only.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.159
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

22:49.201 --> 22:51.203
<i>Hey, how's everything?</i>
How are the girls?

22:51.244 --> 22:53.497
<i>Great.</i>
Everything's great.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.082
<i>[Veronica]</i>
What are you guys doing today?

22:55.123 --> 22:57.876
<i>Oh, you know, they're just</i>
asking a lot of questions,

22:57.918 --> 22:58.960
<i>learning the business.</i>

22:59.002 --> 23:00.087
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

23:00.128 --> 23:01.880
<i>Yeah, don't let them sit around</i>
and watch movies all day.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.173
<i>Give 'em a project.</i>

23:03.215 --> 23:05.425
<i>A project.</i>
That sounds great.

23:05.467 --> 23:06.343
<i>Would you stop this?</i>

23:06.385 --> 23:08.136
<i>These gummies are</i>
for adults only.

23:08.178 --> 23:12.015
<i>If the gummies aren't for kids,</i>
why are they gummies?

23:12.057 --> 23:13.141
<i>Shut up, Kermit.</i>

23:13.183 --> 23:14.726
<i>[Veronica]</i>
Kev, everything okay?

23:14.768 --> 23:15.811
<i>Yes.</i>
Everything's great.

23:15.852 --> 23:18.897
<i>How is everything going on</i>
down there?

23:18.939 --> 23:21.691
<i>I still haven't convinced Mama</i>
to move back.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.819
<i>Her place is pretty nice,</i>
though.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.987
<i>Okay, babe, I gotta go.</i>
The bar's hopping.

23:26.029 --> 23:27.197
<i>[Veronica]</i> <i>Uh, got it.</i>
I'll talk to you later.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.281
<i>-Okay.</i>
I love you.

23:28.323 --> 23:29.616
<i>Tell the girls</i>
that I love them--

23:29.658 --> 23:31.576
<i>- quirky upbeat music</i>
Oh, look at this one.

23:31.618 --> 23:34.871
<i>Indian hawthorn.</i>
Rhapilolepis--

23:34.913 --> 23:36.498
<i>[chuckles]</i>
whatever, girl.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.633
You okay?

23:49.344 --> 23:52.139
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

23:52.180 --> 23:54.683
<i>Feels like his dying wish.</i>

23:54.724 --> 23:56.726
<i>Uh, I think his dying wish</i>
was probably,

23:56.768 --> 24:00.647
<i>"Get this plastic bag</i>
off my head."

24:00.689 --> 24:02.315
<i>Ring the fuckin' doorbell.</i>

24:02.357 --> 24:04.943
<i></i>

24:13.660 --> 24:16.246
<i>Hey.</i>

24:16.288 --> 24:18.165
<i>Uh, sorry to bother you.</i>

24:18.206 --> 24:21.126
<i>Does a woman named Rachel</i>
live here?

24:21.168 --> 24:23.420
<i>I think you've got</i>
the wrong address, son, sorry.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.881
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>
My name's Milkovich.

24:25.922 --> 24:30.844
<i>Terry Milkovich is my--</i>
was my dad.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.679
<i>Look, he knew some woman</i>
named Rachel.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.806
<i>I think she used to live here.</i>

24:38.143 --> 24:39.811
<i>I'm Rachel.</i>

24:43.523 --> 24:48.487
<i>So Terry, my dad,</i>
passed away a few days ago.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.030
<i>Sorry to hear that.</i>

24:50.071 --> 24:53.241
<i>He was murdered, actually.</i>
By a nun.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.201
<i>Or a...</i>

24:54.242 --> 24:55.660
<i>cold-blooded killer nun</i>
in a costume.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.995
<i>We don't actually</i>
know that yet.

24:57.037 --> 24:57.996
<i>Mick.</i>

24:58.038 --> 25:00.540
<i>Anyways, we were going through</i>
some of his shit.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.919
<i>And, uh...</i>

25:03.960 --> 25:05.504
<i>found these.</i>

25:06.546 --> 25:09.841
<i>It's how we found you.</i>
The address on the back.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.969
<i>[Rachel]</i>
Wow.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.680
<i>So how'd you know my dad?</i>

25:15.722 --> 25:19.267
<i>He was my first love.</i>

25:19.309 --> 25:20.477
<i>Really?</i>

25:20.519 --> 25:23.188
<i>Met when we were teenagers.</i>
Spent every second together.

25:23.230 --> 25:26.858
<i>[chuckles]</i>
He made me laugh.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.444
<i>-He did?</i>
-Terry?

25:29.486 --> 25:32.739
<i>Yeah.</i>
He had a great sense of humor.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.909
<i>Asked me to marry him</i>
and I said yes,

25:35.951 --> 25:38.119
<i>but my family was Hasidic, so.</i>

25:38.161 --> 25:40.372
<i>Sorry.</i>
I--w-what's that?

25:40.413 --> 25:42.874
<i>Jewish?</i>

25:42.916 --> 25:44.334
<i>No shit.</i>

25:44.376 --> 25:46.545
<i>When Terry asked</i>
for my father's permission,

25:46.586 --> 25:50.215
<i>he said no,</i>
but Terry wouldn't give up.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.717
<i>He talked to my father.</i>
Said he'd convert.

25:52.759 --> 25:55.095
<i>He really loved me.</i>

25:55.136 --> 25:57.138
<i>My father said,</i>
"Okay, if you convert

25:57.180 --> 26:00.267
<i>and learn Hebrew,</i>
you can marry my daughter."

26:00.308 --> 26:02.394
<i>Terry started studying</i>
the Torah,

26:02.435 --> 26:03.937
<i>took Hebrew lessons</i>
at the temple.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.856
<i>For a year, he tried but it was</i>
too difficult for him.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.276
<i>Here you go.</i>
-He couldn't get it.

26:09.317 --> 26:11.069
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:11.111 --> 26:12.779
<i>Again, he approached my father.</i>

26:12.821 --> 26:14.656
<i>"I've converted to Judaism,"</i>
he said,

26:14.698 --> 26:17.742
<i>"But I can't learn Hebrew.</i>
Can't you meet me halfway?

26:17.784 --> 26:19.578
<i>Let me marry Rachel."</i>

26:19.619 --> 26:23.623
<i>But my father said no way.</i>
Deal's a deal.

26:25.125 --> 26:29.212
<i>So Terry killed him.</i>

26:29.254 --> 26:32.632
<i>-Your dad?</i>
-I am--I'm sorry.

26:32.674 --> 26:33.967
<i>-He--</i>
-Police couldn't prove it.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.428
<i>No witnesses, but...</i>

26:36.469 --> 26:38.263
<i>I know it was Terry.</i>

26:40.557 --> 26:42.559
<i>But, you know,</i>

26:42.601 --> 26:46.438
<i>with your dad out of the way,</i>
you could marry him, right?

26:47.647 --> 26:50.734
<i>I didn't want to marry him.</i>
He killed my father.

26:50.775 --> 26:54.738
<i>-Yeah, that makes sense.</i>
- Uh-huh.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.115
<i>So I ended up marrying Albert.</i>

26:57.157 --> 26:58.783
<i>-Right.</i>
-Okay.

26:58.825 --> 27:03.622
<i>Did Terry know that you married</i>
a Black man?

27:03.663 --> 27:06.833
<i>Uh--yes.</i>

27:06.875 --> 27:09.794
<i>-Mm, that explains that.</i>

27:09.836 --> 27:14.132
<i>Look, he wanted you</i>
to have this, so, uh.

27:20.388 --> 27:22.766
<i>-No, thank you.</i>
-Yeah, we understand.

27:22.807 --> 27:23.850
<i>Actually...</i>

27:23.892 --> 27:27.187
<i>I hate the picture,</i>
but I will keep the frame.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.355
<i>It's from Pottery Barn.</i>

27:28.396 --> 27:30.940
<i>-Very nice.</i>
It is nice.

27:42.035 --> 27:42.827
<i>Hey.</i>

27:42.869 --> 27:44.537
<i>Who's my legal guardian?</i>

27:44.579 --> 27:46.706
<i>Uh, I don't know.</i>
Why?

27:46.748 --> 27:49.709
<i>-Did you get arrested?</i>
-No.

27:49.751 --> 27:50.794
<i>But if I do have one,</i>

27:50.835 --> 27:53.380
<i>it makes it harder for me</i>
to find a place to live.

27:53.421 --> 27:54.881
<i>Look, I don't have time</i>
for this shit right now.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.466
<i>We'll talk about it later,</i>
okay?

27:59.344 --> 28:00.970
<i>Fuck you, Lip.</i>

28:21.908 --> 28:23.410
<i>Hi, I'm Frank Gallagher.</i>

28:23.451 --> 28:25.328
<i>I'm looking</i>
for Benjamin Teasley.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.621
<i>He used to live here.</i>

28:26.663 --> 28:29.249
<i>-Frank Gallagher?</i>
That's right.

28:29.290 --> 28:32.377
<i>That name is so familiar.</i>
I--I--uh--

28:32.419 --> 28:35.547
<i>'Cause I just said it?</i>

28:35.588 --> 28:36.631
<i>Gallagher.</i>

28:36.673 --> 28:40.343
<i>Uh, how'd you--</i>
how did you know Benjamin?

28:40.385 --> 28:44.013
<i>We worked together years ago.</i>

28:44.055 --> 28:47.726
<i>But wait.</i>
I know you, I think.

28:47.767 --> 28:48.601
<i>Um--</i>

28:48.643 --> 28:53.481
<i>Sally--Carol--Sally--Serena--</i>
Serena?

28:53.523 --> 28:56.025
<i>Yes, yes!</i>
Serena Teasley.

28:56.067 --> 28:59.779
<i>-That's it. Holy shit.</i>

28:59.821 --> 29:02.532
<i>Lady Teas.</i>
How are you?

29:02.574 --> 29:04.075
<i>It's Frank.</i>
You remember me?

29:04.117 --> 29:06.077
<i>-Frank?</i>
-Yes.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.913
<i>No, no.</i>

29:08.955 --> 29:12.542
<i>-See, I have Alzheimer's and--</i>
-Says who?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.586
<i>-The doctors.</i>
Yeah?

29:14.627 --> 29:15.879
<i>Well, what do they know?</i>

29:15.920 --> 29:18.590
<i>It's not like there's</i>
an Alzheimer's test.

29:18.631 --> 29:22.802
<i>I think it's a generational</i>
conspiracy against the elderly.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.804
<i>They convince us</i>
we can't remember shit

29:24.846 --> 29:26.306
<i>so they can take advantage</i>
of us.

29:26.347 --> 29:30.226
<i>They put us in nursing homes,</i>
say, "You live here, remember?"

29:30.268 --> 29:31.644
<i>They steal our money, they say,</i>

29:31.686 --> 29:33.897
<i>"No, you never had any,</i>
remember?"

29:33.938 --> 29:35.565
<i>They treat us like we're crazy.</i>

29:35.607 --> 29:39.444
<i>They say,</i>
"You're sick, remember?"

29:39.486 --> 29:40.737
That's true.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.364
<i>You know, the other day,</i>
someone tried to tell me

29:43.406 --> 29:46.826

I'm not an idiot.

29:49.913 --> 29:52.540
<i>No, ma'am.</i>
You are not.

29:52.582 --> 29:53.750
<i>Is Teas here?</i>

29:53.792 --> 29:56.711
<i>I'm trying</i>
to get the gang back together.

29:56.753 --> 29:59.964
<i>Yeah, well, Benjamin's dead.</i>

30:00.006 --> 30:03.426
<i>He died 15 years ago.</i>

30:03.468 --> 30:05.887
<i>What?</i>
No.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.390
<i>Damn it.</i>

30:09.432 --> 30:12.101
<i>That's awful.</i>

30:12.143 --> 30:13.061
<i>Are you sure?</i>

30:13.102 --> 30:14.354
<i>-Yes, yes.</i>
Mm-hmm.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.313
<i>I have it written down.</i>

30:15.355 --> 30:16.898
<i>It's on a Post-it</i>

30:16.940 --> 30:20.360
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
That sucks.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.238
<i>What does?</i>

30:23.279 --> 30:24.989
<i>Nothing.</i>
It--

30:30.203 --> 30:32.330
<i>You take care of yourself,</i>
Serena.

30:32.372 --> 30:33.665
<i>Okay?</i>

30:33.706 --> 30:35.250
<i>You, too.</i>

30:41.005 --> 30:43.591
<i>Uh, say hello to Benjamin</i>
for me.

30:43.633 --> 30:46.177
<i>I will.</i>

30:46.219 --> 30:47.637
<i>Bye.</i>

31:00.024 --> 31:01.109
<i>What happened?</i>

31:01.150 --> 31:03.820
<i>Sheriff went to evict the guy</i>
and he got emotional.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.238
<i>I thought SWAT team was coming.</i>

31:05.280 --> 31:07.907
<i>Is it Bring Your Daughter</i>
To Work Day?

31:07.949 --> 31:08.741
<i>Who's this?</i>

31:08.783 --> 31:11.786
<i>-Officer Gallagher.</i>
-So no SWAT?

31:11.828 --> 31:13.621
<i>I am SWAT, bitch.</i>

31:13.663 --> 31:14.873
<i>Where's everybody else?</i>

31:14.914 --> 31:17.876
<i>Since they defunded the police,</i>
this is what SWAT looks like.

31:17.917 --> 31:20.420
<i>One badass motherfucker like me</i>
on the ground,

31:20.461 --> 31:22.213
<i>one badass sniper on a roof.</i>

31:22.255 --> 31:23.298
<i>Sniper?</i>

31:23.339 --> 31:25.133
<i>Where's the loser with a gun?</i>

31:25.174 --> 31:27.385
<i>-In the house.</i>
-He's terrified, sir.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.262
<i>I think somebody should</i>
just go talk to him.

31:29.304 --> 31:30.972
<i>Too late for that, Junior.</i>

31:31.014 --> 31:32.557
<i>Sniper and a bullet's</i>
a lot cheaper

31:32.599 --> 31:34.017
<i>than paying a SWAT team.</i>

31:34.058 --> 31:37.145
<i>dramatic music</i>

31:43.067 --> 31:44.277
<i>That was quick.</i>

31:44.319 --> 31:46.571
<i>Relax, they're probably just</i>
gonna smack us around,

31:46.613 --> 31:48.031
<i>make sure we don't go</i>
to the cops.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.617
<i>Why would they think we'd go</i>
to the cops?

31:50.658 --> 31:53.411
<i>"These numbers aren't right."</i>
You remember that?

31:53.453 --> 31:55.580
<i>Might as well have accused them</i>
of insurance fraud

31:55.622 --> 31:57.040
<i>right then and there.</i>

31:57.081 --> 31:59.125
Shit.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.168
What are you doing?

32:00.209 --> 32:02.712
<i>How do you know</i>
if you're an organ donor?

32:04.714 --> 32:07.592
<i>The fuck are we?</i>

32:19.228 --> 32:21.814
<i>Keep your stupid fuckin' mouths</i>
shut.

32:21.856 --> 32:23.775
<i>Mr. Baggio will do</i>
all the talking.

32:23.816 --> 32:27.028
<i>Nino Rota's</i>

<i>[Lip]</i>
Oh, shit.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.376
<i>[Brad]</i>
We don't know shit.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.336
<i>You said they're probably just</i>
gonna smack us around.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.046
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
now I'm not so sure.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.506
<i>What the fuck?</i>

32:46.547 --> 32:49.717
<i>Those idiots at BornFree</i>
tell me you can fix anything.

32:49.759 --> 32:52.887
<i>Is this true?</i>

32:52.929 --> 32:54.222
<i>Yeah.</i>
Yeah, I guess so.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.478
<i>It's my grandson's birthday.</i>

33:00.520 --> 33:03.940
<i>These two put this thing</i>
together last night.

33:03.982 --> 33:07.402
<i>It won't run,</i>
the steering's screwed up,

33:07.443 --> 33:10.279
<i>and there are a ton</i>
of leftover parts.

33:10.321 --> 33:11.739
<i>Lesson learned.</i>

33:11.781 --> 33:14.158
<i>Don't ask people</i>
who don't know how to read

33:14.200 --> 33:15.785
<i>to read instructions.</i>

33:18.746 --> 33:19.956
<i>Do you want us to fix it?</i>

33:19.998 --> 33:21.582
<i>Yeah, please.</i>
Yeah.

33:21.624 --> 33:23.918
<i>Oh, and do either of you</i>
know how to tie a bow?

33:23.960 --> 33:25.128
<i>'Cause you know what I'd like?</i>

33:25.169 --> 33:26.671
<i>I'd like to have a big, red bow</i>
on top of this thing here,

33:26.713 --> 33:27.922
<i>you know?</i>

33:29.924 --> 33:31.718
<i>Tie a bow?</i>

33:31.759 --> 33:33.511
<i>Yeah, I-I can do a bow.</i>

33:33.553 --> 33:36.806
<i>Yeah?</i>
-Shouldn't be a problem.

33:41.686 --> 33:45.023
<i></i>

33:45.064 --> 33:48.192
<i>AKA the Kid.</i>
How you been, Kid?

33:48.234 --> 33:48.985
<i>Busy.</i>

33:49.027 --> 33:50.069
<i>I don't know if you've heard,</i>

33:50.111 --> 33:51.946
<i>but I'm putting</i>
the crew together.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.907
<i>Dusted off the ICOE plan.</i>
Remember that?

33:54.949 --> 33:57.994
<i>ICOE?</i>
Ain't nobody pulling ICOE.

33:58.036 --> 33:58.953
<i>I am.</i>

33:58.995 --> 34:01.956
<i>And I need your help</i>
because you're the--

34:01.998 --> 34:05.293
<i>the best...electronics guy</i>
in the biz.

34:05.334 --> 34:09.005
<i>Kid, ICOE was</i>
in case of emergency.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.507
<i>That's why it's called ICOE.</i>

34:11.549 --> 34:14.218
<i>That's why</i>
they call it ICOE.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.304
<i>In case of emergency.</i>

34:16.345 --> 34:19.307
<i>Well, this is an emergency.</i>

34:19.348 --> 34:23.394
<i>Come on, Jelly, one more.</i>
For old time's sake.

34:23.436 --> 34:24.896
<i>Who else do you have?</i>

34:24.937 --> 34:27.940
<i>Johnny's in a wheelchair,</i>
Teas is dead, I'm retired.

34:27.982 --> 34:30.568
<i>-Teas is dead?</i>
-Yeah, a while back.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.611
<i>Jesus.</i>

34:31.652 --> 34:33.362
<i>What do you mean,</i>
you're retired?

34:33.404 --> 34:35.490
<i>I make a decent living</i>
off my investments.

34:35.531 --> 34:38.367
<i>Why would I risk</i>
getting pinched again?

34:38.409 --> 34:39.410
<i>For the money.</i>

34:39.452 --> 34:41.287
<i>I got enough money.</i>

34:41.329 --> 34:44.373
<i>-See my mailbox?</i>
-No. Why?

34:44.415 --> 34:48.211
<i>It's exact replica of my house.</i>

34:48.961 --> 34:51.589
<i>Uh, made a mistake.</i>

34:51.631 --> 34:54.425
<i>You're not the guy for the job.</i>
You've gone soft.

34:54.467 --> 34:55.468
<i>What?</i>

34:55.510 --> 34:56.844
<i>Look at you</i>

34:56.886 --> 34:59.931
<i>with your petunias</i>
and your fancy mailbox

34:59.972 --> 35:01.933
<i>and Costco furniture.</i>

35:01.974 --> 35:04.685
<i>And what did you do</i>
to that poor dog?

35:04.727 --> 35:08.189
<i>-He's a White Sox fan.</i>
-Is that why he's depressed?

35:08.231 --> 35:09.857
<i>Or because you make him</i>
wear clothes?

35:09.899 --> 35:12.610
<i>How many times has he tried</i>
to kill himself?

35:13.486 --> 35:16.155
<i>Get the hell out of here.</i>

35:16.197 --> 35:17.907
<i>If he eats a bunch</i>
of chocolate,

35:17.949 --> 35:19.450
<i>it's not an accident.</i>

35:21.994 --> 35:26.040
<i>Starting bid on this thing</i>
is like 200 bucks.

35:26.082 --> 35:28.751
<i>Gonna have no problem selling</i>
this shit.

35:28.793 --> 35:29.794
<i>Then we can afford</i>

35:29.836 --> 35:31.754
<i>to give the fucker</i>
a proper sendoff after all.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.882
<i>peaceful music playing</i>

35:42.723 --> 35:46.435
<i>He used to throw this at us</i>
when we were kids.

35:46.477 --> 35:47.311
<i>What?</i>

35:47.353 --> 35:50.773
<i>He has a game.</i>
Dodge the Dagger.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.151
<i>Me and my brothers would run</i>
around the house.

35:53.192 --> 35:56.404
<i>Screaming, laughing,</i>
trying not to get stabbed.

35:56.445 --> 35:58.364
<i>-[chuckles]</i>
-That's fun.

35:58.406 --> 35:59.657
<i>Yeah, he threw it at me</i>
one time.

35:59.699 --> 36:02.702
<i>I caught it midair.</i>

36:02.743 --> 36:04.620
<i>Cut the shit out of my hand,</i>
but...

36:07.206 --> 36:10.710
<i>He was so proud of me.</i>

36:10.751 --> 36:12.587
<i>[sarcastically]</i>
Aw.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.215
<i>Fuck is wrong with me?</i>

36:16.257 --> 36:19.886
<i>How many Jews</i>
did this thing kill?

36:19.927 --> 36:21.095
<i>Still kinda wanna keep it,</i>
though.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.513
<i>Is that weird?</i>

36:22.555 --> 36:23.431
<i>Hello.</i>

36:23.472 --> 36:25.308
<i>Put the fucking knife back</i>
in the box.

<i>Johnny Boxcars.</i>
Best wheelman in the business.

36:49.165 --> 36:52.335

<i>It's been a while.</i>

36:53.878 --> 36:54.962
<i>No, it hasn't.</i>

Who told you?

<i>You did.</i>
You were just here, Frank.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.939
<i>We talked about ICOE, remember?</i>

37:12.980 --> 37:16.943
<i>Yeah.</i>
Yeah, of course.

37:16.984 --> 37:19.070
<i>-And you--</i>
-I'm out.

37:19.111 --> 37:20.571
<i>I told you already.</i>

37:20.613 --> 37:21.906
<i>Right.</i>

37:30.331 --> 37:34.085
<i>Did you know ICOE stands</i>
for "in case of emergency"?

37:34.126 --> 37:37.338
-<i>Anderson .
-Paak's</i>

<i>The people are rising</i>

37:43.636 --> 37:46.138
<i>We thought</i>

<i>Them bullets was flying</i>

<i>It's okay.</i>

38:58.711 --> 39:00.338
<i>Okay?</i>
Girl, this is amazing.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.715

<i>-[Kev]</i> <i>Yep.</i>
-Does she now?

40:07.571 --> 40:09.365

His wife got him cancelled.

<i>-Amy, get away from there.</i>
-[Veronica] <i>What she doing?</i>

40:11.283 --> 40:13.327
<i>She's just behind the bar.</i>
Can I call you back?

40:13.369 --> 40:15.204
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

40:16.914 --> 40:17.998
<i>You don't wanna help me out?</i>

40:18.040 --> 40:19.375
<i>Maybe keep Amy</i>
from going behind the bar?

40:19.417 --> 40:21.794

Who am I to parent your kid?

What'd I tell ya?

40:42.731 --> 40:44.316
<i>Yo, what's up?</i>

<i>Do kids in juvie still get</i>

40:46.735 --> 40:48.279
<i>[Carl]</i>
Yeah, why?

40:48.320 --> 40:49.613
<i>It might be the solution.</i>

40:49.655 --> 40:52.074
<i>Trust me, juvie is not</i>
the solution to anything.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.368
<i>It's better than sleeping</i>
on the street.

<i>or a bank robber now works</i>
for the FBI.

41:08.924 --> 41:10.843
<i>You don't need juvie.</i>
You're smart.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.428
<i>So are a lot</i>
of homeless people,

41:14.680 --> 41:15.556
<i>What?</i>

41:15.598 --> 41:18.559
<i>Nothing.</i>
I'll see you later.

<i>I'd like to pop by St. Anne's,</i>

<i>What for?</i>

41:26.192 --> 41:27.151
<i>Well, as I mentioned,</i>

41:27.193 --> 41:29.153
<i>the hushpuppies here</i>

<i>Wha--are you hearing the words</i>

41:33.657 --> 41:34.492
<i>Yes, yes, I am.</i>

41:34.533 --> 41:35.701
<i>But more importantly,</i>

41:35.743 --> 41:37.286
<i>I'm hearing the words</i>
that are coming from above.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.705
<i>I swear to God,</i>
if you don't stop talking.

41:39.747 --> 41:40.873
<i>Sorry.</i>
I'm sorry.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.124
<i>But once you've sat</i>
at the table,

41:42.166 --> 41:43.667
<i>it's hard not to want</i>
to pass the bread.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.837
<i>Can we just order our food,</i>
eat, and go back to work?

41:46.879 --> 41:47.880
<i>And to St. Anne's?</i>

41:47.922 --> 41:49.298
<i>Fine.</i>
We'll go to St. Anne's.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.257
<i>Good.</i>

42:01.310 --> 42:04.522
<i>Terry wanted to be cremated.</i>
No funeral, no fancy jar.

42:04.563 --> 42:07.066
<i>Sure, well, our most basic</i>
package without a funeral

42:07.107 --> 42:08.943
<i>provided by</i>
licensed funeral directors

42:08.984 --> 42:12.029
<i>and a trained specialist</i>
is $699.

Oof.

42:13.113 --> 42:15.032
699 bucks for you
to light a fuckin' match?

42:15.074 --> 42:16.784
It's a little more
complicated than that.

42:16.825 --> 42:18.786
<i>They gotta transport the body,</i>
all that.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.746
<i>That's all-inclusive,</i>
no hidden fees,

42:20.788 --> 42:22.206
<i>a plastic urn is included.</i>

42:22.248 --> 42:24.041
<i>Great, man.</i>
Whatever.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.251
<i>Excellent.</i>

And do you know
where they took your father?

42:30.089 --> 42:31.382
<i>-What hospital?</i>
Yeah, Cook County.

42:31.423 --> 42:33.384
Mm-hmm.
And when did he pass?

42:33.425 --> 42:36.845
<i>Four days ago.</i>
Mm-hmm.

42:36.887 --> 42:38.806
<i>-Um--</i>
Something wrong?

42:38.847 --> 42:41.559
<i>Well, it says the body's</i>
already been transferred.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.935
<i>[Ian]</i>
What does that mean?

42:42.977 --> 42:45.646
<i>Unfortunately, if you don't</i>
claim the body within 24 hours,

42:45.688 --> 42:47.773
<i>they give it to the county.</i>

42:47.815 --> 42:49.858
And then what?
Where is it?

42:49.900 --> 42:52.945
<i>Uh, hmm.</i>
Johnson Creek Cemetery.

42:52.987 --> 42:55.656
<i>It's a communal ground.</i>

42:55.698 --> 42:58.033
<i>The fuck does</i>
communal ground mean?

42:58.075 --> 43:00.327
<i>A mass grave for the indigent.</i>

43:00.369 --> 43:02.580
<i>The what?</i>
Poor people.

43:02.621 --> 43:04.999
<i>Can we get it back?</i>

43:05.040 --> 43:08.127
<i>I don't think so.</i>

<i>Gemma, what are you doing,</i>
Sweetie?

43:11.922 --> 43:13.841
<i>What's going on</i>
with your sister?

43:13.882 --> 43:15.968
<i>I went to a Grateful Dead show</i>
once.

43:16.010 --> 43:18.429
<i>Everybody was dancing</i>
like that.

43:18.470 --> 43:20.889
<i>But there was music,</i>
I think.

<i>- quirky dramatic music</i>
-Oh, no.

43:27.896 --> 43:29.440
<i>Uh, anyone in the bar</i>

43:33.569 --> 43:34.862
No.

43:34.903 --> 43:37.948
<i>I'm in the corner thinking</i>
of sweets

43:37.990 --> 43:39.116
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

43:39.158 --> 43:42.870
<i>Girls, girls, did you eat the</i>
adult candy from the carousel?

43:42.911 --> 43:44.121
<i>Please stop dancing</i>
for a second.

43:44.163 --> 43:45.456
<i>Please stop dancing.</i>
Now, look.

43:45.497 --> 43:47.124
<i>You're not in trouble,</i>

43:47.166 --> 43:48.542
<i>but I need to know because</i>
you can get very sick.

43:48.584 --> 43:52.046
<i>Did you eat the gummies</i>
and the brownies?

43:52.087 --> 43:53.631
<i>I had beer.</i>

43:53.672 --> 43:55.966
<i>You had beer?</i>
But no candy?

43:56.008 --> 43:58.552
<i>I had candy and beer.</i>

43:58.594 --> 44:01.305
<i>You had both?</i>
Great.

<i>Brownies.</i>
Lots of brownies.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.077
<i>[Liam]</i>
No.

44:23.118 --> 44:26.372
<i>Okay.</i>
-Okay.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.095
<i>[Liam]</i>
What's this?

44:41.136 --> 44:42.888
<i>Going over the plan</i>
one last time.

44:42.930 --> 44:47.309
<i>Had to make some adjustments</i>
since I have no crew.

45:01.115 --> 45:03.117
<i>I can be your wheelman.</i>

45:03.158 --> 45:04.702
<i>I appreciate the offer, son,</i>

45:04.743 --> 45:07.663

how to drive.

<i>If we get caught,</i>
I go to juvie.

45:09.873 --> 45:12.459

45:12.501 --> 45:14.253
<i>Not for me.</i>

<i>Then I can be your lookout.</i>

50:01.248 --> 50:03.667
<i>And I'll just take it</i>
back down again.

50:04.876 --> 50:06.420
<i>I don't want you</i>
to sell the house.

50:06.461 --> 50:09.006
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
You should've said something.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.675
<i>Debs!</i>

50:11.717 --> 50:12.843
<i>No!</i>

50:14.302 --> 50:16.013
<i>Look, we can just keep on</i>
doing this

50:16.054 --> 50:17.514
<i>until I give up or you give up,</i>

50:17.556 --> 50:19.141
<i>but me, Ian, Carl, Liam?</i>

50:19.182 --> 50:20.308
<i>We're moving out.</i>

50:20.350 --> 50:23.061
<i>I mean, you make good money</i>
with your handywoman business.

50:23.103 --> 50:24.021
<i>All right?</i>

50:24.062 --> 50:25.188
<i>You can afford a nice place</i>
to rent.

50:25.230 --> 50:27.232
<i>-No, it's not about the money.</i>
-Then what is it?

50:27.274 --> 50:28.900
<i>I want Franny</i>
to have what I had.

50:28.942 --> 50:30.944
<i>I want her to grow up</i>
with family.

50:30.986 --> 50:33.155
<i>I don't want her to be alone.</i>

50:37.409 --> 50:40.287
<i>She's not gonna be alone.</i>

50:40.328 --> 50:42.205
<i>All right?</i>
We're all gonna live nearby.

50:42.247 --> 50:43.540
<i>That is not the same.</i>

50:43.582 --> 50:46.376
<i>Look, we'll do a family dinner.</i>
All right?

50:46.418 --> 50:48.920
<i>Every week at my place.</i>
Everybody has to show.

50:48.962 --> 50:50.547
<i>No excuses.</i>

50:50.589 --> 50:51.923
<i>-Yeah?</i>
-Yeah.

50:51.965 --> 50:53.300
<i>Whole deal, all right?</i>

50:53.341 --> 50:56.470
<i>Silverware, napkins,</i>
real cooking, all right?

50:56.511 --> 50:58.638
<i>No takeout.</i>

50:58.680 --> 51:00.265
<i>Okay.</i>
Think about it.

51:00.307 --> 51:01.892
<i>[Lip]</i>
All right.

51:01.933 --> 51:03.143
<i>Now in the meantime,</i>

51:03.185 --> 51:07.105
<i>do you think you could please</i>
stop sabotaging everything?

51:07.147 --> 51:08.148
<i>Do you know Liam's been out</i>

51:08.190 --> 51:10.400
<i>looking for a new place</i>
to live today?

51:10.442 --> 51:11.693
<i>-What?</i>
-Yeah.

51:11.735 --> 51:12.819
<i>He thinks that</i>
if you guys sell the house,

51:12.861 --> 51:13.820
<i>he's gonna be homeless,</i>

51:13.862 --> 51:17.699
<i>so he's looking</i>
for a new place to live.

51:17.741 --> 51:19.242
<i>Shit.</i>

51:21.828 --> 51:23.914
<i>-He's home?</i>
-Mm-hmm.

51:37.928 --> 51:40.222
<i>Hey, man.</i>

51:40.263 --> 51:43.391
<i>Um, you got a sec?</i>

51:43.433 --> 51:45.685
<i>Sure.</i>

51:45.727 --> 51:48.522
<i>Say, if we sell the house,</i>
you, um...

51:48.563 --> 51:50.649
<i>you worried about</i>
where you gonna live?

51:50.690 --> 51:53.443
<i>Yeah.</i>
I don't want to be homeless.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.697
<i>Well, I'm sorry.</i>
That's, um...

51:57.739 --> 51:59.908
<i>that's my fault.</i>

51:59.950 --> 52:01.910
<i>You know, things have been</i>
really crazy for me lately

52:01.952 --> 52:02.994
<i>and I just--</i>

52:03.036 --> 52:06.498
<i>I had no idea how stressed out</i>
you were about this.

52:06.540 --> 52:10.335
<i>But Tami and I talked</i>
and, um...

52:10.377 --> 52:14.005
<i>we want you</i>
to come live with us.

52:14.047 --> 52:15.298
<i>-You do?</i>
Yep.

52:15.340 --> 52:16.508
<i>And I promise, all right?</i>

52:16.550 --> 52:18.552
<i>You don't have to worry</i>
anymore, okay?

52:18.593 --> 52:20.554
<i>We're gonna find a great house.</i>

52:20.595 --> 52:21.805
<i>You can have your own bedroom</i>

52:21.847 --> 52:24.683
<i>and, I don't know,</i>
maybe even your own bathroom.

52:24.724 --> 52:26.518
<i>You serious?</i>

52:26.560 --> 52:29.312
<i>Yeah.</i>
As a fuckin' heart attack.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.169
<i>-Is that--</i>
-No.

52:52.210 --> 52:54.379
<i>quirky dramatic music</i>

52:54.421 --> 52:56.131
<i>[sighs]</i>
No way.

53:02.179 --> 53:05.265
<i>Attention please</i>

53:10.187 --> 53:12.272
<i>All eyes on me</i>

53:23.200 --> 53:24.659
<i>Attention, please</i>

53:25.660 --> 53:27.162
<i>All eyes on me</i>

<i>Wanna see?</i>
