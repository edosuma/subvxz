[Pop] It's like the angel of death

00:16.808 --> 00:18.184
A family of four was murdered.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.187
[Veronica] There was a third child.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.231
You know who killed your family?

00:23.314 --> 00:25.066
A preacher passing through town.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.944
A group of men killed him.
Justice had been served.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.864
I know about the Snake Charmer.

00:31.948 --> 00:35.160
If you cause a stink, I will make sure
that video goes straight to the sheriff.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.995
I love you, Ronnie.

Archie, whatever issues I have,
I can't let myself go there with you.

[Jughead]  Used to be, in ye olden days,

every December, a lord of misrule presided
over the winter holidays,

01:03.480 --> 01:06.316

Thanks, Archie. Thanks, Fred.

01:12.238 --> 01:15.575
Thank you, for letting us set up shop
in front of the diner.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.956
You guys gonna stay in town for break?

01:22.457 --> 01:26.836
Yeah. We were gonna visit my mom,
but she booked a single's cruise, so...

01:26.920 --> 01:30.089
-How are you and Veronica?
-We've been better.

01:30.965 --> 01:34.594

haven't been in the greatest place.

Jughead, you want a Christmas tree?
You and your dad, on the house?

01:37.680 --> 01:39.224
It would have to be a small one, Mr. A.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.019
So, I'll see you
at Kevin's Secret Santa thing?

01:43.102 --> 01:45.313
Yeah, that sounds like a great idea.

all I think about is the Black Hood

and the pain he's caused to the people
that I care about, including you.

05:47.096 --> 05:51.809
I know. And the fact that he's still
out there is giving me anxiety nightmares.

everywhere I look, all I see is...

05:57.899 --> 05:59.942

Excuse me, who are you?

You mean, my name?

Uh, where's Mr. Svenson?

06:12.121 --> 06:14.665
No idea. He's been out a few days.

06:15.666 --> 06:17.126

You and Veronica confronted Mr. Svenson

-about his connection to the Black Hood.
-And now he's not here.

06:31.599 --> 06:36.104
-What if something happened to him?
-We found out Mr. Svenson's secret.

06:36.896 --> 06:40.525
What if we led the Black Hood to him?
What if we got him killed?

06:49.784 --> 06:53.871

He's been out all week with a cold.

can't even pay their own medical bills.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.453
Since when are you a communist?

12:25.911 --> 12:30.416
Since Archie told me that he and his dad
are drowning in Fred's medical bills

12:30.499 --> 12:34.837
to the tune of $86,000,
which is why I was thinking--

12:34.920 --> 12:37.214
- Absolutely not.
-That's a lot of money.

The Lodge charitable trust has made
its donations for the fiscal year.

The kind of father he is.

I've saved Christmas.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.043
Look how happy Nana Rose is.

13:14.877 --> 13:19.673
You spoiled, wretched little brat.
How do you expect to pay for all this?

13:20.466 --> 13:21.383
Oh.

13:22.134 --> 13:26.138
I was thinking maybe you could go
to Mr. Lodge for a job.

13:26.931 --> 13:30.142
Of course, he'd probably ask what skills
you have, and you'd be forced to admit

13:30.226 --> 13:33.646
that the only skill you have is being
a terrible mother.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.316
I guess you're gonna have
to get creative in the new year.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.695

Fine, I just iced
some ginger bread cookies.

14:14.937 --> 14:15.980
Polly's favorite.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.857
Just in case there's a Christmas miracle
and she comes home.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.236
Oh, by the way, there was a gift
for you on the steps.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.946
Your secret Santa.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.031
I took it up to your room.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.119
Secret Santa?

14:43.924 --> 14:44.842
[gasps]

14:51.974 --> 14:56.395
"Enclosed is a finger that belongs
to the sinner Joseph Conway."

14:56.478 --> 14:58.272
He's talking about Mr. Svenson.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.191
"You have one final trespass to unearth.

15:01.275 --> 15:05.529
Find the truth, reveal it to the town,
and you'll perhaps save his life."

15:05.613 --> 15:10.409
He kidnapped Mr. Svenson, Arch.
And now he's mutilating him.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.203
[cell phone buzzing]

15:13.287 --> 15:14.538
Arch, Arch. Hey.

15:19.376 --> 15:22.129
-[Svenson]  Betty, please.
-Mr. Svenson, is that you?

15:23.088 --> 15:26.425
[Black Hood]  It is, Betty,
but his name's Joseph Conway.

15:26.508 --> 15:28.177
He's lost a lot of blood.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.555
Though it's nothing compared to the blood
on the hands of this town.

15:31.639 --> 15:35.351
Exhume the past,
find where the primal sin was committed

15:35.434 --> 15:38.312
and you'll find
the sinner Conway may be alive.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.064
-And as always, don't--
-What?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.233
You maniac. Don't tell Sheriff Keller?

15:44.610 --> 15:45.861
[line beeps]

15:46.278 --> 15:50.366
Archie, what sin? What can
Mr. Svenson possibly be guilty of?

15:50.449 --> 15:52.242
Veronica and I talked to him.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.745
His entire family was murdered
by some crazy preacher.

15:54.828 --> 15:58.165
Maybe the people who adopted him
know something we don't.

15:58.248 --> 16:01.919
Wait. Before he was adopted,
Mr. Svenson lived as Joseph Conway

16:02.002 --> 16:03.379
at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.298
-Will they talk to us?
-They better.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.715
Out of respect for you.

17:30.257 --> 17:34.178
But your parole officer, Mr. Walsh,
he sure was curious.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.805
-Walsh was here?
-Yeah. Don't worry. I got rid of him.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.476
But he already has heard that the Serpents
are moving into narcos territory.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.107
[FP] Ta-da.

Dad, this isn't gonna work.

18:05.334 --> 18:10.964

or weapons, or God knows what.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.593
-How long is this gonna go on--?
-As long as Penny wants.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.262
If her favors keep getting bigger,
which you know that they will,

18:17.346 --> 18:19.389
what happens when she asks
for more Serpents on this?

18:19.473 --> 18:21.183
Then I'll bring more Serpents!

18:23.435 --> 18:27.106
You know what? You're right, this isn't
gonna work, you and I living together.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.274
So maybe you can go back to Fred's
or to Betty's.

18:29.358 --> 18:33.195
-Betty? I split with Betty to--
-Then what do you want me to say?!

18:33.278 --> 18:37.866
I just want you to let me help fix
this mess that I made.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.370
Get this through your thick skull,
Jughead. We're trapped.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.080
We got no leverage.

18:43.747 --> 18:47.000
If that means I gotta be Penny's
dancing monkey for the time being,

18:47.084 --> 18:48.502
then that's how it goes.

18:51.338 --> 18:54.174
I'm gonna get some rest.
I have a long night ahead of me.

18:56.009 --> 18:59.972
Yes, hello, I'm calling
to settle an account

19:00.055 --> 19:02.683
for one of your patients, Fred Andrews.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.436
Of course, I'm his business partner.

19:07.813 --> 19:08.856
Uh-huh.

19:08.939 --> 19:12.526
I'd like to pay the bill in full
and keep it anonymous,

19:12.609 --> 19:13.819
an angel donation.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.239
Yes, I'm aware of the amount.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.283
My name?

19:20.784 --> 19:25.414
Hermione Apollonia Lodge.
And it's a black American Excess card.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.501
Number 29572300...

19:29.585 --> 19:32.212
Penny Peabody has got
my dad dealing drugs.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.717
I know this,
'cause she had me doing it before him.

19:37.885 --> 19:41.346
Now she's roped in Tall Boy
and Sweet Pea.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.599
Man, if you're pissed
because your old man tapped me--

19:43.682 --> 19:47.936
No, Sweet Pea, I'm pissed
because I don't want the Serpents

19:48.020 --> 19:49.521
to end up like the Ghoulies.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.107
And I doubt
that any of you became Serpents

19:52.191 --> 19:55.235
just to be at the beck and call
of a drug queenpin.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.613
I know where this ends.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.823
Death, jail.

20:01.366 --> 20:04.953
Which is why
in the interest of self-preservation...

20:06.997 --> 20:08.123
we have to take out Penny.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.251
Snake Charmer's helped some of us.

20:12.336 --> 20:15.923
Oh, yeah? What did she ask for
in return, Sweet Pea?

20:16.006 --> 20:17.007
How many favors?

20:18.008 --> 20:20.260
Now, if we don't stop Penny tonight...

20:21.220 --> 20:25.307
she is going to get
every single one of us in on this.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.227
I promise you. I promise you, Sweet Pea.

20:30.145 --> 20:33.941
What I'm asking is,
are you willing to risk your necks

20:34.441 --> 20:35.859
to save my dad's life?

20:39.154 --> 20:43.075
-What is the first law?
-No Serpent stands alone.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.164
I'm in.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.290
Me too.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.419
Let's do this.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.135
Joseph Conway,

21:02.552 --> 21:05.806
Joseph Svenson as you know him,
was a troubled youth.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.392
-There was no saving him.
-Meaning, he was a sinner?

21:08.475 --> 21:12.437
-No, he was a child, a victim.
-Did he suffer from survivor's guilt?

21:15.649 --> 21:18.026
I've already said too much.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.778
-[Betty] No.
-[Archie] Betty.

21:20.821 --> 21:25.784
Sister Woodhouse,
when my sister escaped this dungeon,

21:25.867 --> 21:28.495
she told me
all about the corporal punishment.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.498
So, please help us with this,

21:31.915 --> 21:35.127
or I will expose
the Sisters of Quiet Mercy

21:35.210 --> 21:37.921
for the house of horrors
that it really is.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.218
[Woodhouse]
After his family was massacred,

21:43.677 --> 21:47.848
young Conway-- Svenson identified
the man responsible.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.435
Then a small group of Riverdale citizens

21:52.019 --> 21:57.649
took matters into their own hands,
and, well, executed him.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.861
It was only later when he was with us

22:00.944 --> 22:03.864
that Joseph admitted that,
in his terror and shock,

22:03.947 --> 22:06.325
he may have pointed a finger
of accusation--

22:06.408 --> 22:07.659
At the wrong man.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.037
Oh, my God.

22:10.662 --> 22:14.124
Svenson's sin was sentencing
the wrong man to death.

22:15.751 --> 22:20.047
Did Svenson--? Did Conway ever talk
about who carried out the execution?

22:22.883 --> 22:25.010
They came here once to see Joseph.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.638
It was a group of men and one woman.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.766
I don't know their names.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.894
And I can't remember
what they looked like.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.647
Just that the woman had
the most striking hair.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.652
White, save for a cherry-red stripe.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.199
[Betty] Nana Rose Blossom?

22:51.661 --> 22:53.163
[banging on door]

22:56.208 --> 22:57.042
FP?

22:58.335 --> 23:00.087
Well, you're early, old hoss.

23:05.675 --> 23:06.510
Penny.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.845
Ho, merry, ho.

23:09.262 --> 23:11.348
[sighs] Jughead Jones.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.391
Nice crowbar.

23:14.309 --> 23:17.395
This? I brought it
in case I need to pry the door open.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.774
Are you gonna give me a hand with this?

23:20.857 --> 23:23.860
Your dad will be here in, like, what,
15, 20 minutes?

23:24.778 --> 23:26.613
He probably won't be too happy
to see you, huh?

23:26.696 --> 23:30.283
I wouldn't worry about that.
Neither of us are gonna be here.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.454
[sighs]

23:34.538 --> 23:36.248
Is this supposed to scare me?

23:38.917 --> 23:41.837
I would not do this if I were you.
You are making a big mistake.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.339
You are making--
Are you out of your mind?!

23:49.886 --> 23:50.804
Hey, guys.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.267
Finishing up some last-minute shopping?

23:56.226 --> 24:00.147
We were, but then we got
the most fascinating call from our bank,

24:00.230 --> 24:04.901
confirming a charge that was made
to my credit card, the amount of $86,000.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.863
Oh. So that went through.

24:08.947 --> 24:09.781
Great.

24:10.657 --> 24:14.578
Yeah, I decided that you would cover
Fred's medical expenses.

24:15.162 --> 24:19.583
I mean, if you can afford to buy Pop's
and then lie to my face about it.

24:21.334 --> 24:25.422
So, how is it that we can now
suddenly afford an entire diner?

24:28.925 --> 24:32.012
[Hiram] You wanted a more active role
in Lodge Industries

24:32.095 --> 24:33.471
and we let you have it.

24:34.306 --> 24:38.143
Then you break into my office and try
to use whatever you find as leverage.

24:38.226 --> 24:42.272
Now, I admit, there's a lot
you don't know, and that's on purpose.

24:42.355 --> 24:45.400
How can I be part of this family
if you keep hiding things from me?

24:45.483 --> 24:48.320
Mija,  you think you wanna know everything,
but you don't.

24:48.403 --> 24:51.907
My name is on all of those documents
in your desk, Daddy.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.034
Doesn't that mean
I have the right to know?

24:54.117 --> 24:57.120
Yes, yes, it does, Veronica.

24:58.121 --> 25:02.042
But that means the time
for being daddy's little girl is over.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.252
It's time to work.

25:05.378 --> 25:07.881
All of us in lockstep.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.091
She deserves to know the truth, Hiram.

25:13.053 --> 25:13.887
All right.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.015
All right.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.267
Follow me to the study.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.191
[breathing heavily]

25:30.612 --> 25:32.447
-Where am I?
-You're in Greendale.

25:33.657 --> 25:34.616
Your new home.

25:36.117 --> 25:40.247
But frankly, Penny,
I don't care where you set up shop.

25:42.415 --> 25:46.711
But it's not gonna be in Riverdale,
and it's not gonna be with the Serpents.

25:47.254 --> 25:50.340
You wanna deal drugs?
You wanna extort people?

25:50.757 --> 25:52.008
That's your business.

25:52.842 --> 25:55.720
But not on the Southside.
That belongs to us.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.097
[laughing]

25:57.472 --> 26:00.100
You stupid, cocky kid.

26:02.394 --> 26:06.064
The Serpent law says
you can't hurt one of your own.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.068
Oh, Penny, it's time you learn.

26:12.362 --> 26:13.363
Grab her.

26:15.657 --> 26:19.995
What are you doing?
Get off of me! Get off. Get off of me!

26:21.371 --> 26:24.749
-That tattoo doesn't make you a Serpent.
-No, no. [screams]

26:24.833 --> 26:25.875
No, no, no.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.759
Cheryl, we need to see your grandmother.

26:34.843 --> 26:38.763
Nana Rose seldom has visitors.
She'll be pleased. Entree.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.937
[Betty] Nana Rose,
we have some questions for you

26:46.021 --> 26:48.940
about something that happened
in Riverdale a long time ago.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.403
A man killed his family,
and a group of people decided

26:53.486 --> 26:56.323
-to take justice into their own hands.
-Oh, dear.

26:56.406 --> 26:58.992
Here in Riverdale?

26:59.075 --> 27:03.455
Yes, and you were part of that group,
weren't you?

27:03.997 --> 27:07.334
-Is this a Christmas inquest?
-A man's life is at stake.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.545
[Betty]
Were you with this group when they--?

27:11.129 --> 27:14.174
When you killed this man for revenge?

27:14.257 --> 27:15.216
Oh, no.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.844
No girls allowed.

27:17.927 --> 27:23.099
They told me to stay at home
while they took care of the bad man.

27:26.561 --> 27:30.774
Nana Rose, this is so important.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.360
Where did they hang the bad man?

27:33.943 --> 27:35.737
Oh, they didn't hang him.

27:36.654 --> 27:39.366
Oh, no. They gave him a proper burial.

27:41.117 --> 27:45.246
Buried him alive.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.458
Where? Where did they do that?

27:49.125 --> 27:52.712
Ask your grandfather, Polly dear.
He was there.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.215
My--? My grandfather?

27:55.632 --> 28:00.470
I had a picture of them
smiling at the place.

28:01.054 --> 28:04.849
Standing under the devil's hands.

28:05.475 --> 28:08.019
Picture? What picture?

28:09.729 --> 28:10.563
Cheryl?

28:11.147 --> 28:14.192
I wonder if you might take me to my room.

28:14.275 --> 28:17.445
I suddenly feel quite ill.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.823
[Cheryl] Satisfied, you vultures?

28:19.906 --> 28:22.951
Your reindeer games are over.
Now get the hell out.

28:24.702 --> 28:29.082
Archie, my grandfather helped murder
an innocent man.

28:29.165 --> 28:31.209
Betty, who even knows
if what she was saying is true?

28:31.292 --> 28:32.794
That picture Nana Rose mentioned.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.588
When Grandpa Louis died,
we packed up his house,

28:35.672 --> 28:37.006
and we donated most of his stuff.

28:37.090 --> 28:40.009
He had pictures.
We kept them and we organized them.

28:40.093 --> 28:43.513
-Take a breath. Where are they?
-They're at my house.

28:43.596 --> 28:45.181
-That's great.
-Archie,

28:45.265 --> 28:49.269
my grandfather killed a man in cold blood.

28:49.352 --> 28:52.439
An innocent man.
What if that's why he picked me?

28:52.522 --> 28:54.774
The Black Hood.
That's why he's been calling me.

28:54.858 --> 28:57.861
-Revenge for something I didn't do.
-Betty, listen.

28:58.987 --> 29:02.407
This is the part... where we end this.

29:03.324 --> 29:06.244
Where we save Mr. Svenson
and stop the Black Hood.

29:06.327 --> 29:09.539
But I need you with me.
I can't do this alone.

29:09.622 --> 29:13.001
Tomorrow, we're gonna wake up and
everything is gonna go back to how it was.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.253
But right now, I need you with me.

29:15.628 --> 29:17.547
-I need Betty Cooper.
-Arch.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.264
Betty.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.183
We have to hurry.

29:44.574 --> 29:45.909
[Hermione] Well, Veronica.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.869
Now you know.

29:47.952 --> 29:49.245
You know everything.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.748
So,  mija , what do you think?

29:57.545 --> 29:58.379
I'm in.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.298
But I have ground rules.

30:00.757 --> 30:01.591
Well...

30:02.383 --> 30:03.343
one ground rule.

30:04.385 --> 30:05.220
By all means.

30:06.721 --> 30:09.933
-I refuse to do anything illegal.
-[Hermione] Well, that's fine.

30:10.725 --> 30:13.895
Especially since we're not doing
anything illegal either.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.190
Let me share two words to live by.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.109
Plausible deniability.

30:20.652 --> 30:25.281
Also... that charge I made
for Fred's medical bills?

30:25.865 --> 30:28.993
-I want that to stick.
-It's gonna complicate matters.

30:29.077 --> 30:32.705
-Fred is a proud man. He's not--
-We'll smooth that over.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.917
And the truth is, we'll need Fred
for what comes next.

30:36.584 --> 30:40.129
Fine. Assuming the Fred situation
can be finessed...

30:42.590 --> 30:43.842
do we have a deal?

30:44.801 --> 30:46.135
We do, Daddykins.

30:47.887 --> 30:48.805
We have a deal.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.103
-[Jughead]  Hey, Dad.
-[FP]  What's all this?

30:55.186 --> 30:58.314
This is a celebratory dinner.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.278
Penny didn't show up
for your pickup, did she?

31:04.279 --> 31:05.113
No.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.867
No, she didn't. Why?
Do you know something about that?

31:09.701 --> 31:10.952
She's gone, Dad.

31:12.328 --> 31:15.206
I rallied the younger Serpents.
We drove her out of Riverdale.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.167
-I got my pound of flesh in the process.
-Are you nuts?!

31:18.668 --> 31:21.379
-She'll be back. Better believe that.
-She won't!

31:21.921 --> 31:23.506
I was very persuasive.

31:24.507 --> 31:27.468
And even if she does,
we will take care of it.

31:28.011 --> 31:30.179
You and me and the other Serpents.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.640
In unity, there is strength.

31:32.724 --> 31:37.353
That's the sixth law. While you were
in jail, I recited that. I lived by that.

31:39.188 --> 31:43.318
You wanna take my jacket? You wanna
relegate me to Toys for Tots? Fine.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.862
But I'm still a Serpent, Dad. And this?

31:46.779 --> 31:49.198
This life you wanted to protect me from?

31:51.117 --> 31:52.201
I'm proud of this.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.915
I'm proud of who I am.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.709
You can't take that away from me.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.589
[Betty]
Nana Rose said it was a group of men.

32:05.465 --> 32:08.009
I mean, there's one photo
that I kind of remember.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.095
Dad said it was taken after Grandpa Louis
and some friends

32:11.179 --> 32:13.348
planted some trees in Pickens' Park.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.310
Wait.

32:17.852 --> 32:18.686
Is this it?

32:19.729 --> 32:21.105
[Archie] Look at the ground.

32:21.189 --> 32:25.026
That's where they buried the preacher,
where Svenson could be maybe still alive.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.779
Yeah, look at the branches.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.823
-The devil's hand.
-That tree is in Pickens' Park.

32:32.992 --> 32:35.286
We'll call Sheriff Keller on the way.
Come on.

32:41.584 --> 32:43.461
[Betty] Look around. There.

32:52.136 --> 32:53.304
Yeah.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.314
Oh, my God, Archie.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.822
[both panting]

33:17.870 --> 33:19.080
Where's Mr. Svenson?

33:22.375 --> 33:25.086
Why would the Black Hood bury
an empty coffin?

33:26.337 --> 33:27.714
-What if it's a--?
-[gun cocks]

33:30.258 --> 33:31.759
[Black Hood] Get in the coffin.

33:35.304 --> 33:37.724
No. No way.

33:39.142 --> 33:42.937
Get in the coffin or I shoot her
in the head. Right now!

33:53.698 --> 33:58.369
Shut the coffin
and step out of the grave, Betty. Do it.

34:06.252 --> 34:07.503
I'm sorry.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.509
Pick up the shovel.

34:14.093 --> 34:15.219
Fill in the grave.

34:15.678 --> 34:16.971
[Betty sobbing]

34:17.889 --> 34:19.223
Please don't make me.

34:25.271 --> 34:26.606
[grunting]

34:28.066 --> 34:31.235
We know what Mr. Svenson's sin is.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.154
What he did.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.784
That's the town's secret sin.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.120
That's what you want revealed, right?

34:41.954 --> 34:44.082
We can do that. I can do that.

34:44.874 --> 34:48.086
Mr. Svenson, wherever he is,
he doesn't have to die.

34:48.419 --> 34:49.962
Archie doesn't have--

34:50.046 --> 34:52.381
[sirens wailing]

35:01.891 --> 35:03.017
Archie.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.394
-Where is he? Where'd he go?
-This way.

35:20.743 --> 35:21.786
[Archie] Hey!

35:25.248 --> 35:26.082
Stop!

35:26.999 --> 35:27.959
Stop!

35:28.042 --> 35:29.377
Right down now!

35:30.044 --> 35:33.297
Get down or I'll shoot you.
I swear to God, I'll do it.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.592
You tried to kill my father.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.344
And my friends.

35:38.427 --> 35:40.471
You're gonna pay for your crimes.

35:40.555 --> 35:43.933
You are not escaping. This ends tonight.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.105
I said stop!

35:49.939 --> 35:50.982
[gunshot]

35:59.240 --> 36:00.658
[Keller] Archie, put the gun down.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.536
-It's okay.
-Sheriff Keller.

36:03.619 --> 36:04.662
[Keller] Stay back, Betty.

36:09.375 --> 36:10.585
He's dead.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.253
Who is he?

36:17.800 --> 36:19.886
The town demanded blood for blood.

36:41.490 --> 36:42.658
[Keller] Give me the gun.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.758
[indistinct chatter]

36:58.841 --> 37:00.843
["Silent Night" playing over speakers]

37:00.927 --> 37:05.640
Your instinct about Svenson was right,
Ronnie. You thought he was the Black Hood.

37:06.349 --> 37:09.644
We could've ended it at school,
where we confronted him.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.855
I didn't see it,
I didn't see it in his eyes.

37:12.939 --> 37:17.276
Forget his eyes.
I can't believe he cut off his own finger.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.028
The finger of accusation.

37:19.612 --> 37:23.324
[scoffs] So, we know who done it.
Why did he do it?

37:23.407 --> 37:26.369
Mr. Svenson accused an innocent man

37:26.994 --> 37:29.747
of murdering his family
and got the man killed.

37:29.830 --> 37:33.292
Maybe in some backwards way,
he thought that targeting sinners

37:33.376 --> 37:35.086
would balance the scales somehow.

37:35.795 --> 37:36.712
I don't know.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.172
No, no. It makes sense.

37:39.006 --> 37:43.344
I mean, Svenson was always around,
lurking in the hallways.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.097
He could've seen me and Miss Grundy
in the music room.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.599
Yeah, he could have seen Moose
and Midge buying Jingle-Jangle.

37:48.683 --> 37:52.144
Guys, this is starting to feel
like that last scene in  Psycho.

37:53.312 --> 37:54.605
The truth is...

37:59.944 --> 38:03.322
I... have nothing, actually.

Except that he's in a body bag
and we aren't.
