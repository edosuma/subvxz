00:48.257 --> 00:49.507
Move 'em out, boys!

00:49.591 --> 00:51.592
[indistinct chatter]

00:55.806 --> 00:57.306
- [man 1] Let's go!
- [dog barking]

00:57.641 --> 00:59.142
[man 2] Move it out!

01:20.748 --> 01:22.832
[owl hooting]

01:29.548 --> 01:32.508
Tonight... is the night.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.760
[hooting]

01:33.844 --> 01:38.431
All Hallow's Eve.
The moon is full.

01:38.515 --> 01:42.226
l'll show all those fools
just how powerful

01:42.311 --> 01:45.188
Warwick the Warlock really is!

01:45.272 --> 01:48.566
[hooting] Master, you are the evilest.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.818
Yes, l am.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.744
Excuse me, Mr. Hoot, sir?

01:59.828 --> 02:01.913
When do we get to meet
the Howlloween Hound?

02:01.997 --> 02:04.123
l think Master's almost ready.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.121
- [barking]
- The manor!

02:44.748 --> 02:48.042
That no-good Warwick.
He must have the puppies.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.461
- [barking]
- Give me those bolt cutters.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.468
[barking]

03:03.517 --> 03:04.767
Drat.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.604
We must hurry. [hiccups]

03:16.280 --> 03:20.366
Howlloween Hound
on All Hallow's Eve...

03:20.450 --> 03:23.703
...with the moon full and bright,

03:23.787 --> 03:26.289
open a portal beyond light.

03:26.373 --> 03:31.544
Call three times to summon
a hound of great might.

03:31.628 --> 03:36.549
The souls of five puppies
you shall have on this night.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.968
Howlloween Hound.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.972
Howlloween Hound!

03:48.353 --> 03:52.440
To our side, Howlloween Hound!

03:56.361 --> 03:58.738
Who dares summon me?

03:58.822 --> 04:01.240
l do, Hound.

04:01.325 --> 04:02.742
Warwick the Great.

04:03.619 --> 04:08.664
l have the five puppy souls
of the same blood.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.668
l believe they are
what you need to open the portal.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.588
And why should I open
the portal for you?

04:15.672 --> 04:18.257
Because together we shall unleash

04:18.341 --> 04:22.261
all the creatures
of the underworld on Fernfield.

04:22.346 --> 04:27.433
And then you and I
shall rule the land, Hound.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.268
l like the sound of that.

04:29.353 --> 04:33.981
But we only have this Halloween night,
while the moon is full.

04:39.071 --> 04:42.281
The Howlloween Hound will see you now.

04:42.366 --> 04:43.908
Let me go first.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.870
- [man 1] Come on, boys.
- [man 2] Here we go now.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.085
- Be careful, guys.
- OK, watch your backs, boys.

04:54.169 --> 04:58.839
Pip! We have to find him, Dad!
He's my best friend!

05:00.717 --> 05:01.968
We will, Joseph.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.219
Grab that tree trunk.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.721
We have to break down the door.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.308
Pip!

05:11.520 --> 05:14.647
l've changed my mind. l don't wanna
go with the Howlloween Hound.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.525
Master, the puppy
doesn't want to go now.

05:17.609 --> 05:20.653
All I wanted was a wise owl.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.197
And I seem to have got a moronic parrot.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.409
- You're next.
- [biting]

05:26.493 --> 05:28.119
[yelling]

05:29.663 --> 05:30.663
You can't escape!

05:43.844 --> 05:45.594
He's catching up to me!

05:46.930 --> 05:49.724
Might as well accept your fate!

05:52.269 --> 05:53.978
[evil laughter] Got you!

05:57.441 --> 06:00.276
[dog whining]

06:00.360 --> 06:02.028
- Pip!
- [barking]

06:02.112 --> 06:03.446
Stay back!

06:03.530 --> 06:05.489
Stop, Warwick!

06:06.366 --> 06:09.577
Stay back or l will
turn you all into toads!

06:10.120 --> 06:11.495
Stay back!

06:15.292 --> 06:17.376
- [growling]
- [croaking]

06:19.588 --> 06:23.340
Soon you will all be my slaves!

06:31.058 --> 06:32.391
Son!

06:32.476 --> 06:33.893
- Deputy Tracker...
- [growls]

06:33.977 --> 06:35.311
...after him!

06:37.397 --> 06:40.066
Quickly, Hound. Dawn is here!

06:40.150 --> 06:41.734
Take the last puppy.

06:41.818 --> 06:42.985
l'm fading.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.737
Complete the spell!

06:44.821 --> 06:46.572
[howling]

06:48.325 --> 06:49.241
Pip!

06:55.082 --> 06:58.626
There's nothing l despise more
than petulant young children!

06:58.710 --> 07:00.044
- Let me go!
- [screams]

07:00.128 --> 07:01.504
No! Pip!

07:01.588 --> 07:04.006
- [barking]
- [yelling]

07:05.509 --> 07:08.844
[groaning] The sun! My eyes!

07:10.180 --> 07:11.555
[grunting]

07:13.183 --> 07:16.060
Hound! Open the portal!

07:16.144 --> 07:21.190
l need all five puppy souls.
lt's too late, Warwick.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.736
lt's over, Warwick.

07:25.821 --> 07:29.115
You're under arrest.
Enough of your black magic.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.407
You're through.

07:30.492 --> 07:31.617
Never.

07:31.701 --> 07:35.121
l'll take this town
under my control one day.

07:35.205 --> 07:38.415
Mark my words. l'll be back!

07:38.500 --> 07:40.459
[yelling]

07:44.297 --> 07:47.258
What in tarnation just happened?

07:51.263 --> 07:53.806
[sobbing] Dad,
look what they did to Pip.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.896
This is a statue, son.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.359
No, it's Pip.
We have to turn Pip back.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.654
Joseph, l'm right here.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.905
[gasping]

08:12.159 --> 08:15.786
We have to get out
of this place now.

08:18.748 --> 08:19.748
[Joseph] No.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.543
Come on, son. Let's go.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.648
Wait. Why are you afraid?
lt's just me, Pip.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.233
[indistinct chatter]

08:47.903 --> 08:49.278
What happened, Sheriff?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.197
l don't know.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.907
But hopefully it won't happen again.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.121
Oh, no! l'm trapped in here.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.792
This home is officially condemned.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.794
- [man 1] Good idea!
- [man 2] About time!

09:11.885 --> 09:14.136
Let's board it up, boys!

09:14.221 --> 09:16.013
l don't want anyone going in.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.641
[crowd murmuring]

09:24.731 --> 09:26.732
[hooting]

09:34.241 --> 09:38.452
[oman] It was 75 years ago
that the Manor was boarded up.

09:39.371 --> 09:42.498
No one is exactly sure
what happened that night

09:42.582 --> 09:45.292
or whether the legend
is even true at all.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.214
But it's an interesting part
of Fernfield folklore, regardless.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.715
l can't wait for tonight.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.261
Halloween is my favorite
event of the year, paws down.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.430
You do a trick and
you're guaranteed to get a treat.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.933
lt's trick or treat, Budderball.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.268
Even better!

10:02.352 --> 10:04.770
For me, it's all about the costume.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.563
l can't wait to dress up.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.775
Kids go in there every Halloween...

10:09.859 --> 10:13.862
...and they say the Howlloween Hound's
name three times in the mirror.

10:13.947 --> 10:14.947
They're never seen again.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.448
Where did you hear that?

10:16.533 --> 10:19.243
Come on. He's just trying to scare us.

10:19.327 --> 10:23.455
No. No, it's true.
And he gets their pets too.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.041
Once you hear the Hound's howl...
it's too late.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.670
Either way, this place
gives me the creeps.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.714
[howling]

10:35.885 --> 10:37.845
- [both laughing]
- [all] Oh, my gosh.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.808
OK, Rodney and Skip,
no more tricks.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.268
- Good one.
- Come along, children.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.644
Onto the bus!

10:45.729 --> 10:49.273
We have one more stop
on our spooky Fernfield tour.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.524
[giggling]

10:51.234 --> 10:52.693
Come on, get the lead out.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.237
Come on, let's go.
Let's get on the bus.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.824
[Rodney] You should have seen
the look on their faces.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.206
Where's B-Dawg hiding?

11:08.001 --> 11:10.210
l wasn't hiding, yo.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.425
l was just getting ready
to pounce on that Hound.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.260
Yeah, right, dude.

11:18.345 --> 11:22.014
You were hiding like a scaredy-cat,
'cause you thought there was a ghost.

11:22.098 --> 11:25.934
Pshaw, dawg.
B-Dawg is afraid of nothing,

11:26.019 --> 11:27.936
especially no ghost!

11:28.021 --> 11:30.689
Then why are you afraid to go
trick-or-treating tonight?

11:30.774 --> 11:32.524
[all laughing]

11:32.609 --> 11:34.193
Nice one, dude!

11:34.277 --> 11:36.403
Fine. l'll prove it.

11:36.488 --> 11:39.615
l'll go in there right now,
call out that Howlloween Hound,

11:39.699 --> 11:41.825
and kick his tail, yo.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.416
B-Dawg, wait.
Where are you going?

11:54.881 --> 11:58.634
Whoa! This place is really creepy.

12:04.933 --> 12:08.018
A pup? What is he doing in here?

12:08.103 --> 12:11.730
Come on, guys. We can't leave
B-Dawg in there by himself.

12:22.909 --> 12:27.287
[nervously laughing]
See? lt's not too scary.

12:31.626 --> 12:32.584
[chandelier clinking]

12:32.669 --> 12:34.420
Did you guys just see that?

12:34.504 --> 12:35.712
See what?

12:35.797 --> 12:38.590
A strange glow, like a ghost.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.260
Uh, nice one, dawg.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.595
Maybe we just oughta leave.

12:43.680 --> 12:48.934
Ha! Look who's the 'fraidy cat now,
big tough Budderball.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.437
We must respect
the spirits of the night.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.064
Ghosts are lost souls
that can't find their way to heaven.

12:54.149 --> 12:57.025
B-Dawg the Brave, here l go.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.447
[Rosebud] B-Dawg!

13:02.866 --> 13:05.534
Let's reel him in
before we get in trouble.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.340
This is the great
Deputy Tracker's grave...

13:20.425 --> 13:21.884
[kids murmuring]

13:21.968 --> 13:24.344
...one of the best canine officers
our town ever saw.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.679
[boy 1] What? Where?

13:25.763 --> 13:28.599
[woman] He had a nose for crime.

13:28.683 --> 13:32.102
lf there was evidence,
he had the best sniffer in town.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.979
- He could just smell it.
- [screams]

13:34.063 --> 13:35.063
[boy 2] What?

13:36.566 --> 13:39.943
- Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson!
- Whoa.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.739
That's the caretaker.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.074
He's been running this place
as long as l can remember.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.994
Yo, dawgs, did you see
that creepy old guy?

13:49.078 --> 13:51.121
Yeah, that dude's, like, spook central.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.874
OK, let's continue on, children.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.641
[gulping]

14:16.231 --> 14:17.689
Here we go, B-Dawg.

14:17.774 --> 14:21.610
Just say it three times,
and it will all be over.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.742
[stuttering] Howlloween Hound.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.585
Howlloween Hound.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.006
OK, nothing happened. Let's go!

14:44.759 --> 14:47.219
Stop, please! Don't say it!

14:47.303 --> 14:48.512
lt's a ghost!

14:48.596 --> 14:50.472
Let's get out of here, dudes!

14:50.557 --> 14:52.015
Come on, B-Dawg. Run!

14:55.937 --> 14:58.021
Don't say it again!
You'll release them!

14:58.106 --> 14:59.356
[screaming]

15:03.111 --> 15:07.072
You're... you're the Howlloween Hound!

15:07.156 --> 15:09.908
Oh, no! You said it three times!

15:09.993 --> 15:13.495
[screaming] Run for your life!

15:21.796 --> 15:23.297
Wait!

15:25.008 --> 15:27.884
Wait! l'm not the Howlloween Hound!

15:27.969 --> 15:30.596
[screaming] The ghost is on my tail!

15:30.680 --> 15:32.639
[hooting]

15:46.654 --> 15:50.365
Yo, that was a ghost, dawgs!

15:50.450 --> 15:53.285
A real off-the-chain ghoul!

15:53.369 --> 15:56.121
Dudes, was that the Howlloween Hound?

15:56.205 --> 16:00.751
l said Howlloween Hound
three times into the mirror, dawgs.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.878
l released the Howlloween Hound!

16:02.962 --> 16:04.546
Could it really be true?

16:04.631 --> 16:07.549
They've released Master
after all these years?

16:07.634 --> 16:11.803
B-Dawg is correct, although
he was smaller than l'd imagined.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.598
Whatever it was, we are outta there.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.768
And I, for one, am never going back.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.645
Come on. Let's catch up to our kids.

16:25.068 --> 16:28.070
[haunted house sounds]

16:28.154 --> 16:31.323
Now, l know you're all excited
about trick-or-treating tonight,

16:31.407 --> 16:35.285
but let's not forget that your Fernfield
history projects are due Monday.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.370
Monday?

16:37.914 --> 16:39.498
What a bonehead.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.416
Yes, Billy. ls that a problem?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.835
lt's been assigned
for the last two weeks.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.798
Oh! Oh, that project!

16:47.882 --> 16:49.633
Yeah, l totally finished mine.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.511
Great, Billy.
What subject did you choose?

16:54.138 --> 16:56.098
l, uh...

16:56.683 --> 16:59.434
The Curse of the Howlloween Hound.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.396
Perhaps your project might
finally answer

17:02.480 --> 17:04.606
whether the legend is true or not.

17:05.148 --> 17:06.692
Oh, oh, definitely!

17:06.776 --> 17:08.318
OK, class dismissed.

17:08.403 --> 17:11.445
[high-pitched giggling]
Happy Halloween!

17:12.365 --> 17:13.865
- Bye.
- Wow.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.992
What am l gonna do?

17:17.078 --> 17:19.871
lf l don't pass this project,
l'm gonna be history!

17:19.955 --> 17:21.330
What do you mean, Billy?

17:21.415 --> 17:23.040
Sounds like you've got
a great spooky topic.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.711
l just picked the first thing
that came into my head.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.630
l totally forgot about
this history project.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.715
Uh-oh.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.300
l don't even know if l'll be able to go
trick-or-treating tonight.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.219
Now, that's a disaster.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.221
You know, if the police were involved,

17:36.305 --> 17:38.640
then l bet Sheriff Dan knows
a thing or two about it.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.059
- [all] Yeah.
- All right.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.769
- Yeah, good idea.
- All right, let's go check it out.

17:42.854 --> 17:43.854
- All right.
- Yeah, let's go.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.943
The Howlloween Hound, yeah.
l've heard that spooky story

17:50.027 --> 17:52.070
around the campfire once or twice.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.905
Careful, kids,
there's a stair here that...

17:53.990 --> 17:55.949
- [kids yelling]
- Yep, that's the one.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.245
OK. Sheriff Jim kept all the evidence

18:00.329 --> 18:01.997
from every case
he was ever on down here.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.875
We're bound to find something
in these cold case files.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.252
How are we gonna find
anything down here?

18:07.336 --> 18:11.006
Don't worry, kids. l got this
entire room perfectly organized.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.591
- [grunting]
- [clattering]

18:15.678 --> 18:18.013
- That's been moved.
- [Billy] Uh-huh.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.850
OK, we're looking for 1937.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.269
- 1978.
- [Sheriff Dan] 1983.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.397
1976. This could prove difficult.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.193
Hey, l think this is it, Sheriff Dan!

18:31.277 --> 18:33.487
- What?
- Yeah, check it out!

18:33.571 --> 18:34.780
- Holy Dinah!
- Sweet!

18:34.864 --> 18:36.573
That's good detective work, Billy.

18:36.657 --> 18:37.783
Yeah.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.452
Halloween, 1937.

18:40.536 --> 18:41.870
- Whoa!
- Oh!

18:41.954 --> 18:43.371
[Billy] No! No, wait, wait!

18:43.456 --> 18:44.623
[Pete] Oh, dude.

18:44.707 --> 18:48.168
- [groans]
- Uh... Wow.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.337
OK... yep.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.255
Thanks, Sheriff Dan.

18:53.716 --> 18:54.758
Sweet.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.345
- Whoa, that's cool.
- Whoa!

18:58.429 --> 18:59.346
- What is that?
- Wow!

18:59.430 --> 19:00.514
- Whoa.
- Sick.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.098
That's quite the magic wand.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.643
Hey, that'd be great
for my presentation.

19:04.727 --> 19:05.560
Huh.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.812
Do you think l could borrow it?

19:06.896 --> 19:07.979
- [Bartleby] Yeah.
- [Pete] That's a good idea.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.482
Well, it is a part
of this cold case file.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.735
But it's been over 70 years, so, uh...

19:14.695 --> 19:17.155
- Ah, what the heck.
- Cool.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.658
But remember, that's police evidence,
so l'm gonna need that back, Billy.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.326
Oh, l promise l'll bring it back.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.454
OK. Wouldn't want
you casting any spells.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.791
Well, let's go back upstairs.
l have a soufflé in the oven.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.167
[Bartleby] Soufflé?

19:29.252 --> 19:30.961
[Pete] Dude.

19:31.045 --> 19:34.047
[snoring]

19:38.678 --> 19:40.136
Hey there, Deputy dude.

19:40.221 --> 19:43.181
Huh? What's going on?

19:43.266 --> 19:45.767
Ooh! Top of the morning to you, Buddies.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.895
Actually, it's afternoon, Deputy.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.444
We were wondering where you pups went.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.363
Hey, guys, it's four o'clock!

19:58.447 --> 20:00.365
lfwe don't get ready
for trick-or-treating,

20:00.449 --> 20:02.784
we're not gonna maximize
our candy potential!

20:02.869 --> 20:05.036
Yeah. Thanks for all the help,
Sheriff Dan.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.872
Well, good luck
with your project, Billy.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.291
You let Sheriff Dan know if there's
anything else l can do for you.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.209
And you kids, remind your parents

20:11.294 --> 20:14.004
to come to the Fernfield
Spooky Brew Ha-Ha tonight,

20:14.088 --> 20:15.547
or l'll have to arrest them!

20:15.631 --> 20:17.173
[all laughing]

20:17.258 --> 20:19.467
- [all] Thanks, Sheriff. Bye!
- [Sheriff Dan] See you!

20:22.179 --> 20:23.179
[recorded laughter]

20:23.264 --> 20:24.806
Come on, B-Dawg.

20:28.811 --> 20:29.936
Let's go, boy.

20:32.607 --> 20:33.982
[door closing]

20:35.401 --> 20:37.694
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh, hello, dear.

20:37.778 --> 20:38.945
l gotta get ready for trick-or-treating.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.615
- Did you pick up the costume?
- Oh, l sure did.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.325
- lt's just over there on the table.
- Cool.

20:43.409 --> 20:46.369
And I bought a matching one
for B-Dawg as well!

20:46.454 --> 20:47.871
Oh, sweet.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.542
[bell dinging]

20:56.631 --> 20:57.547
Mom?

20:58.591 --> 21:01.134
Oh, isn't that adorable?

21:01.761 --> 21:05.055
You are just gonna be the cutest
little hip-hopper out there.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.808
[stammering] Mom, l said hip-hop rapper,

21:08.893 --> 21:12.103
not hip-hop rabbit!

21:12.188 --> 21:15.357
l mean, are you trying
to completely ruin our street cred?

21:15.441 --> 21:18.276
- [barking]
- l'm sorry. We cannot wear these.

21:18.361 --> 21:21.821
Billy, you two will look
adorable as bunnies.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.698
[groans]

21:29.622 --> 21:31.456
Huh.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.879
[stammering]

21:39.715 --> 21:41.800
- Check it out, B-Dawg.
- [whimpering]

21:41.884 --> 21:44.803
l present to you, Warwick the Warlock,

21:44.887 --> 21:47.389
- at your service.
- [whining]

21:48.683 --> 21:51.893
l'm sorry, B-Dawg,
but it's really not that bad.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.104
[whining]

21:57.817 --> 21:59.609
Hey, check this out, buddy.

21:59.694 --> 22:02.529
This must have been
what the warlock looked like.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.156
And see the photo?

22:05.241 --> 22:08.743
That must be the boy from the story,
and his little pup, Pip. See?

22:11.664 --> 22:13.873
2332 Pine Lane.

22:14.709 --> 22:15.959
l wonder if he still lives there.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.504
Yeah, l know, it was,
like, 75 years ago.

22:19.588 --> 22:23.508
He'd be older than Grandpa by now.
Man, that's old.

22:24.510 --> 22:28.221
lf l could just talk to him,
this would be the easiest project ever.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.183
- [owl hooting]
- lt's kind of creepy.

22:43.112 --> 22:44.487
Hurry!

22:44.572 --> 22:46.364
Almost... got it.

22:48.409 --> 22:49.868
- There!
- [cat growling]

22:49.952 --> 22:51.036
[yelling]

22:51.954 --> 22:54.789
- Dude, chill. lt's just a dumb cat.
- [yowling]

22:54.874 --> 22:56.708
l bet there's tons
ofweird stuffwe can use

22:56.792 --> 22:58.793
to scare those dudes from class with.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.212
Oh, man. lt's getting dark.
We better hurry.

23:05.426 --> 23:08.219
[grunting]

23:14.435 --> 23:15.602
Whoa.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.187
[Skip] Almost.

23:17.271 --> 23:20.231
What? l got more visitors?

23:23.944 --> 23:25.320
[Skip] Check it out.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.988
[Rodney] Whoa.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.715
[kids laughing]

23:45.800 --> 23:47.634
All right.

23:50.137 --> 23:53.681
With the Howlloween Hound,
l will control the world.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.601
- [chuckling]
- [exaggerated laughter]

23:56.685 --> 23:58.436
Hey, that is really good.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.271
- Thanks, dawg.
- Whoa.

24:01.357 --> 24:03.733
Why is that thing, like, glowing?

24:03.818 --> 24:05.443
- [Sam] Oh, yeah. lntriguing.
- Huh.

24:05.528 --> 24:06.402
l don't know.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.447
Maybe it has batteries or something.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.368
Argh, nice costume, matey!

24:13.452 --> 24:15.745
Does the "B" stand for bunny?

24:15.830 --> 24:17.038
[all laughing]

24:20.042 --> 24:23.128
This ain't no ordinary rabbit costume,
dawgs.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.796
lt's a killer rabbit.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.924
And those things are da bomb!

24:28.008 --> 24:31.302
- Now let's go score some sugar.
- Oh, yeah.

24:31.387 --> 24:34.305
There are healthy
alternatives to sugar, too.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.141
My family is handing out

24:36.225 --> 24:40.895
homemade almond raisin granola.
How cool is that?

24:40.980 --> 24:43.481
OK, no offense,
but l vote we skip Sam's house!

24:43.566 --> 24:45.066
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.776
- Me three.
- Ah, man.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.528
- [Alice] Sorry.
- Sorry, buddy. Come on!

24:48.612 --> 24:50.196
[Alice] Whoa, check out the full moon!

24:52.741 --> 24:54.868
[owl hooting]

24:55.953 --> 24:58.079
Awesome!

25:17.933 --> 25:20.059
[creaking]

25:21.937 --> 25:22.979
Whoa.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.450
"Rodentus...

25:38.787 --> 25:40.872
...trans...

25:40.956 --> 25:42.040
...something."

25:43.626 --> 25:45.960
- Rodney!
- What?

25:59.391 --> 26:02.060
- [rumbling]
- [groaning]

26:04.647 --> 26:06.481
[clinking]

26:12.446 --> 26:14.572
We are... free!

26:14.657 --> 26:15.907
Oh, no!

26:15.991 --> 26:17.325
[evil laughter]

26:19.078 --> 26:22.997
Oh, it was horrendous in there!

26:23.082 --> 26:25.667
- [groaning]
- [whimpering]

26:25.751 --> 26:28.544
Are you the ones that released us?

26:29.171 --> 26:30.922
- Speak up!
- [both gasping]

26:31.006 --> 26:31.965
Wait a minute.

26:33.175 --> 26:36.010
Where's my staff? My book?

26:37.680 --> 26:40.348
You've stolen them, haven't you?

26:40.891 --> 26:42.267
Give me that.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.603
Ratius rodentius!

26:45.688 --> 26:48.398
- [sizzling]
- [Warwick laughing]

26:48.482 --> 26:50.441
[Skip squeaking] Oh, no!
What happened to us?

26:51.443 --> 26:52.777
[Rodney] Let's get out of here!

26:52.861 --> 26:57.615
Now... they won't be able
to warn the rest of the town.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.784
We must finish the spell.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.954
l can smell the blood
of the five puppies we need.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.455
They have been in this room.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.374
Oh, no!

27:07.960 --> 27:10.003
[squeaking]

27:12.881 --> 27:14.757
Hey, watch where you're going!
That's my tail!

27:14.842 --> 27:17.135
Will you zip it? We have to find help!

27:17.219 --> 27:18.761
[yowling]

27:21.223 --> 27:24.142
You'll make a great Halloween treat.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.601
[loud yowl]

27:25.686 --> 27:27.729
Come on! We were just kidding before!

27:27.813 --> 27:29.522
We love cats, really!

27:32.735 --> 27:34.610
[frantic squeaking]

27:36.905 --> 27:38.656
[yowling]

27:44.079 --> 27:45.413
[growling]

27:49.918 --> 27:51.878
[creaking]

28:07.436 --> 28:09.270
[hooting]

28:12.858 --> 28:15.360
[sighs] Oh.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.321
The Manor has seen better days.

28:18.405 --> 28:21.949
[hooting] Master, it's true.
You're back!

28:22.868 --> 28:25.620
[Warwick] Yes, Hoot,
you moronic birdbrain.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.622
Go and find my staff.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.624
Nothing can happen without it.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.043
lt'll be illuminated by the moonlight.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.294
Yes, Master.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.006
[hooting]

28:39.927 --> 28:42.136
Hoot will find the glowing staff

28:42.221 --> 28:44.597
and l will find my spell book.

28:45.766 --> 28:49.143
lf they can leave, then maybe l can too.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.314
l'm free! Yes!

28:53.399 --> 28:56.567
OK, l better go warn those puppies.

29:04.910 --> 29:05.910
- Thanks!
- Thank you!

29:05.994 --> 29:06.994
Thank you!

29:07.079 --> 29:08.830
- Come on!
- Guys, let's go to this house.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.206
l hope they have strawberry fizz bombs
at the next house.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.833
- Let's go check out this one!
- Come on, let's go!

29:12.876 --> 29:15.503
- They're amazing!
- Let's go.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.672
Come on!

29:21.802 --> 29:25.721
Yo, let's get this trick-or-treatin'
show on the road.

29:25.806 --> 29:29.559
l don't want any more run-ins
with that Howlloween Hound dog

29:29.643 --> 29:32.228
or any other creepy ghost,
for that matter.

29:32.312 --> 29:35.648
Dude, they're just kids
in Halloween costumes.

29:35.732 --> 29:40.695
Either way, dawg, l'm keeping
my eye on everything tonight.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.573
- [Warwick groaning]
- [girl] Wait up, Sam!

29:50.789 --> 29:52.373
Ah! Get away!

29:52.458 --> 29:53.583
Look at that old guy.

29:53.667 --> 29:54.584
- Get away!
- Excuse me.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.252
- Real scary.
- [mumbles]

29:56.336 --> 29:57.587
[kids screaming]

29:57.671 --> 29:59.464
This is horrible.

29:59.548 --> 30:03.050
Evil creatures are roaming the streets.

30:03.802 --> 30:04.552
Oh.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.305
- Hurry!
- Yeah, come on.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.974
The best candy's at the next house!

30:10.058 --> 30:11.267
[kids] Trick or treat!

30:11.351 --> 30:13.603
That pink goblin is hideous!

30:13.687 --> 30:17.315
You've misled me, Warwick.
This town has already been taken over.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.817
Quickly, Hound.
We still have some time.

30:19.902 --> 30:22.820
Go and find your puppy souls.

30:27.201 --> 30:30.203
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on, let's go cash out.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.214
[doorbell cackling]

30:41.298 --> 30:42.965
- Dude!
- Whoa.

30:43.050 --> 30:46.552
Who dare knocks on my door?

30:46.637 --> 30:49.639
- Dude, sweet costume!
- Yeah!

30:49.723 --> 30:53.017
Dude, it's Frankendude to you.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.019
- Oh, hello, children!
- Mrs. Carroll!

30:55.103 --> 30:58.481
- Hi, Mrs. Carroll.
- lt's Mrs. Frankendude.

30:58.565 --> 31:01.192
- Welcome to our spooky house.
- Yeah.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.819
- So, what do you think?
- lt's totally awesome.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.530
- Oh, it's so cool.
- Trick or treat?

31:05.614 --> 31:08.866
Rad. Yeah, let Frankendude
help you out there, all right?

31:08.951 --> 31:11.410
Except one per customer or
Frankendude will get upset

31:11.495 --> 31:12.537
and then have to storm the village.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.872
- [all laughing]
- That will be uncool.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.374
[all] Good night. Thanks!

31:16.458 --> 31:18.209
- Later.
- Shaka brah!

31:18.293 --> 31:19.502
Hang ten on it.

31:19.586 --> 31:20.878
[Sam] Let's check that place out!

31:20.963 --> 31:23.214
- See ya in the tube.
- [laughing]

31:23.298 --> 31:24.674
[Billy] Let's go check out
the next house, guys.

31:24.758 --> 31:25.508
[Pete] Let's hurry up!

31:25.592 --> 31:28.135
- [laughing]
- [puppy whining]

31:28.220 --> 31:31.097
- Oh, he's so cute.
- lt's time for us to get some treats.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.640
Watch and learn.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.891
[Mr. Carroll] Look,
he's coming up on the porch.

31:33.976 --> 31:35.226
[Carrolls exclaiming]

31:35.310 --> 31:37.103
- [whining]
- The dude begs.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.648
- Oh, bark.
- He chases his tail...

31:40.732 --> 31:43.901
Cute! He's going in a circle!

31:43.986 --> 31:45.361
...then rolls over.

31:45.445 --> 31:48.322
And for the finale,
Budderball's signature trick:

31:48.407 --> 31:50.074
Plays starving!

31:50.158 --> 31:51.242
- Oh!
- Oh.

31:51.326 --> 31:52.743
- [whining]
- Go get some treats.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.245
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.832
lf Budderball's an expert at anything,
it's begging for treats.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.875
- Oh, yes.
- He earned it.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.586
He did earn it.
There you go.

32:06.174 --> 32:08.301
- Yeah!
- Really, really good!

32:08.385 --> 32:11.012
- l'm so excited, you guys!
- That was awesome!

32:20.772 --> 32:24.859
Hey, there's another ghost!
Maybe he can help me.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.698
Excuse me. My name is Pip.

32:30.782 --> 32:34.368
l was wondering if you've seen
five Golden Retriever puppies?

32:36.371 --> 32:39.874
[laughing] That tickles.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.960
[screaming] Ghost!

32:43.045 --> 32:46.589
Help, Mom!
l just saw a real ghost!

32:46.673 --> 32:49.091
[mother] Time to go home.
You've had enough sugar for one night.

32:49.176 --> 32:54.263
Uh-oh. l guess ghosts are scary.
l better disguise myself.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.316
[muffled laughter]

33:11.031 --> 33:13.157
[Billy] That was such a jackpot.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.826
[Alice] l got all my favorite candy.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.120
[Billy] Come on, Sam!

33:18.205 --> 33:19.664
[Sam] Geez, guys, wait up, l'm coming.

33:19.748 --> 33:22.792
[hooting] There's the Master's staff.

33:22.876 --> 33:25.544
[Sam] Two words: Godzilla feet!

33:25.629 --> 33:28.756
- Trick or treat!
- Oh, what have we here?

33:28.840 --> 33:30.424
- All right, here's for you.
- Thank you!

33:37.265 --> 33:40.309
There you are.
Thank goodness l found you guys!

33:40.394 --> 33:43.854
Yo, if you're lookin' for a pawtograph,

33:43.939 --> 33:45.690
l ain't in da mood.

33:45.774 --> 33:48.192
l'm here to warn you about
the Howlloween Hound.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.944
How did you know about that?

33:54.241 --> 33:57.451
[yells] lt's the Howlloween Hound!

33:57.536 --> 34:00.454
l told you dawgs he'd come after us!

34:00.539 --> 34:02.498
- No, l'm not.
- Run, dawgs!

34:02.582 --> 34:03.624
[all yelling]

34:15.762 --> 34:17.804
[all breathing heavily]

34:20.641 --> 34:24.061
Yo, this ghost dawg
just doesn't give up!

34:24.146 --> 34:25.563
What do we do?

34:25.647 --> 34:27.063
l know a place.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.358
lf there's anyone who can help us
with a paranormal problem,

34:29.443 --> 34:32.360
it's Zelda. Follow me.

34:32.446 --> 34:36.157
Please, wait.
l'm just trying to warn you guys.

34:44.206 --> 34:45.916
[puppies barking]

34:46.001 --> 34:47.585
[panting]

34:47.668 --> 34:49.335
That must be them.

34:54.134 --> 34:57.803
lt looks like someone else
is after those puppies, too.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.726
[breathing heavily]

35:06.313 --> 35:08.439
Remind me to never
come trick-or-treating

35:08.523 --> 35:12.693
here at 2332 Pine Lane again!

35:12.778 --> 35:15.946
Talk about no Halloween spirit!

35:16.031 --> 35:17.782
2332 Pine Lane?

35:22.370 --> 35:25.122
Hey! Guys, the boy
from the story lived here.

35:25.207 --> 35:27.208
This was Joseph's house.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.710
Go knock on the door, Billy.
Maybe he still lives there.

35:29.795 --> 35:33.297
Alice, come on, he'd be, like,
a thousand years old or something.

35:33.381 --> 35:36.759
Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.552
[sighing]

35:39.971 --> 35:41.764
[gate opening]

35:46.728 --> 35:49.396
[owl hooting]

36:04.579 --> 36:06.831
l guess nobody's home.

36:06.915 --> 36:09.083
See, l told you guys.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.086
lt's just a creepy old house
with nobody in it.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.257
[all gasping]

36:16.341 --> 36:17.675
What?

36:17.759 --> 36:19.426
Behind you, look.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.054
Oh, ha ha. Good one, Sam,

36:22.138 --> 36:23.848
but l'm not gonna fall for...

36:23.932 --> 36:25.015
[Pete] Uh...

36:25.100 --> 36:26.934
For reals?

36:27.018 --> 36:28.644
[Sam] Yeah.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.190
Oh! Um...

36:34.109 --> 36:37.903
Uh, hello, sir. l...

36:40.991 --> 36:43.826
l was just wondering
if this boy still lives here.

36:43.910 --> 36:48.539
No, this boy hasn't lived here
in quite some time.

36:48.623 --> 36:49.957
What do you want?

36:50.041 --> 36:54.378
Well, you see,
l'm doing this school project

36:54.462 --> 36:56.630
on The Curse of the Howlloween Hound,

36:56.715 --> 36:59.174
you know, an old Fernfield legend,

36:59.259 --> 37:04.221
and l was just hoping
to ask him some questions.

37:04.306 --> 37:06.390
l'm sure if that boy
wanted to talk about it

37:06.474 --> 37:09.393
he would have a long time ago.
Now go away!

37:09.477 --> 37:12.354
Oh, OK. l'm sorry, sir.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.649
Hey, boy!

37:15.734 --> 37:17.526
Where'd you get that staff?

37:17.611 --> 37:20.154
Hand it over!
That's very dangerous!

37:20.238 --> 37:21.989
[all] Run! Go!

37:22.073 --> 37:23.240
Come on! Go!

37:23.325 --> 37:25.534
[Billy] He's behind us!

37:27.746 --> 37:29.455
[Sam] So creepy!

37:29.539 --> 37:30.539
[exhales]

37:35.170 --> 37:40.132
l must find out who's responsible
for this infestation.

37:40.216 --> 37:44.845
No one beats Warwick the Warlock
at his own game.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.098
What is this?

37:48.183 --> 37:52.519
Perhaps the evil sorcerer lives there?

37:52.604 --> 37:54.355
[exhales]

37:59.694 --> 38:03.572
All the ghouls and goblins
are flocking to his door.

38:03.657 --> 38:04.615
[laughing]

38:04.699 --> 38:06.617
[electronic laughing]

38:10.830 --> 38:12.456
[kids] Trick or treat!

38:12.540 --> 38:14.541
- [cackling]
- [screams]

38:14.626 --> 38:18.587
- Who dares...
- [screams]

38:19.047 --> 38:21.799
Dude, a little bit, uh,
old for trick-or-treating?

38:21.883 --> 38:23.384
No!

38:23.468 --> 38:26.178
Now give me what's rightfully mine!

38:26.763 --> 38:29.056
OK, l think that would entail
a trick on your part.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.058
[hooting]

38:34.646 --> 38:36.647
[gasps] Wow.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.732
Master, l have good news.

38:38.817 --> 38:41.902
OK, that's... Wow, ventriloquism.
That's impressive.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.530
Yeah, bro, you just
got yourself a treat. Nice.

38:50.078 --> 38:54.248
So, this is what
food tastes like these days.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.544
Later.

39:01.089 --> 39:04.466
Now, Hoot, tell me the good news.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.010
Have you found my staff?

39:06.094 --> 39:08.345
Yes, a young warlock has it.

39:08.430 --> 39:10.514
[sighs]

39:10.598 --> 39:13.350
l leave for 75 measly years,

39:13.435 --> 39:16.145
and they find someone new to replace me.

39:16.229 --> 39:18.105
- [kids] Trick or treat!
- Where's the respect?

39:18.189 --> 39:19.606
[electronic laughing]

39:19.691 --> 39:21.275
[sighs]

39:22.902 --> 39:25.320
[breathing heavily]

39:31.119 --> 39:32.786
[panting]

39:32.871 --> 39:34.538
l think we lost him.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.665
Why is that ghost dude after us?

39:36.750 --> 39:39.168
Maybe he wants to drink our blood!

39:39.252 --> 39:40.544
That's vampires.

39:40.628 --> 39:44.048
Maybe he wants to eat our brains.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.799
That's zombies, dude.

39:45.884 --> 39:49.219
Maybe he wants to devour
everything he sees.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.972
- That's Budderball.
- Hmm?

39:52.057 --> 39:55.392
lt's probably because B-Dawg
released him from the mirror.

39:55.477 --> 39:58.062
Oh, sure, dawg, blame me!

39:58.146 --> 40:02.900
lt's you guys teasing me and calling me
scaredy-cat that made me do it.

40:02.984 --> 40:06.987
lt's true. We have to take personal
responsibility for our own actions.

40:10.325 --> 40:13.160
- [boy] Wait up!
- [all] Trick or treat!

40:13.244 --> 40:16.580
He's got all kinds of terrifying
creatures following him.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.832
- Thanks!
- Let's check out that place.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.250
How will we get to him?

40:20.335 --> 40:22.252
Those are just his friends, Master.

40:22.337 --> 40:26.673
Friends? With creatures
of the underworld?

40:26.758 --> 40:29.343
- No, they're...
- Silence!

40:29.427 --> 40:31.512
- l need to focus.
- [kids] Trick or treat!

40:33.973 --> 40:35.265
- Come on, guys! Let's go!
- Let's go over here!

40:35.350 --> 40:37.184
- You there!
- Huh?

40:37.268 --> 40:40.437
- Young warlock.
- Um, he's...

40:40.522 --> 40:41.855
[chuckles]

40:43.024 --> 40:46.151
Do you know who l am?

40:46.820 --> 40:49.780
Uh... l'm not sure?

40:49.864 --> 40:53.075
l am Warwick the Warlock,

40:53.159 --> 40:55.828
the evilest warlock known to man!

40:55.912 --> 40:56.912
[hiccups]

40:56.996 --> 40:58.747
[all laughing]

41:01.251 --> 41:02.626
- [yelling]
- [Sam] Oh!

41:04.546 --> 41:07.422
l will make all of you ghouls my slaves!

41:07.507 --> 41:09.883
[Billy] Uh... [chuckles]

41:09.968 --> 41:11.218
Now...

41:12.470 --> 41:16.223
...give me that staff!

41:16.307 --> 41:17.975
Here, take it, Mister.

41:18.059 --> 41:20.102
- Whoa!
- [yelling]

41:21.771 --> 41:24.106
- What was that?
- Whoa!

41:24.190 --> 41:25.399
That was awesome.

41:27.735 --> 41:28.944
How did you do that?

41:29.028 --> 41:31.321
Dawg, l have no idea!

41:31.406 --> 41:34.533
But l'm pretty sure that guy
was who he says he is.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.451
- What do you mean?
- Check this out!

41:38.371 --> 41:39.663
That dude really is the Warlock!

41:39.747 --> 41:41.456
- Yeah!
- Oh, no.

41:41.541 --> 41:44.001
- [coughs]
- [Sam] Uh, guys...

41:44.085 --> 41:46.795
l believe that now would be
an opportune time to run.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.589
- Go!
- Run!

41:49.924 --> 41:51.508
Are you OK, Master?

41:51.593 --> 41:57.264
l clearly underestimated that warlock.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.849
[coughs]

41:58.933 --> 42:00.392
[Billy] Guys, come on!

42:03.104 --> 42:04.605
Come on!

42:05.440 --> 42:06.356
Whoa.

42:06.441 --> 42:08.859
[all panting]

42:08.943 --> 42:10.611
What was with that guy?

42:10.695 --> 42:15.449
Yo, l have no idea,
but he wanted this thing pretty badly.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.327
We better find Sheriff Dan, like, now!

42:18.411 --> 42:19.786
- [Billy] Let's go.
- [Bartleby] Let's go.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.415
[grunts]

42:30.924 --> 42:32.507
[cackling]

42:33.468 --> 42:36.511
Yeah, again, great bit before,

42:36.596 --> 42:39.223
but, uh, it's kinda one piece
of candy per trick.

42:39.307 --> 42:43.685
Look, l need your help, monster.

42:43.770 --> 42:46.396
You're big and you're scary,

42:46.481 --> 42:49.149
the perfect henchman for this job.

42:49.234 --> 42:51.401
Slavius mineus!

42:51.486 --> 42:53.612
- [laughing]
- What the...

42:59.035 --> 43:04.539
[exhales] Now, you will do
exactly as l tell you.

43:04.624 --> 43:09.711
Dude.

43:09.796 --> 43:14.758
l want you to find a young warlock

43:14.842 --> 43:20.138
whose staff has a shiny blue crystal.

43:20.223 --> 43:22.391
l want you to seize it.

43:23.101 --> 43:24.935
Yes, Master.

43:25.019 --> 43:27.312
And then eliminate him.

43:27.397 --> 43:30.565
Yes, Master.

43:30.650 --> 43:35.445
Dude. Dude.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.990
[groaning]

43:39.993 --> 43:41.618
[grunting]

43:42.996 --> 43:44.454
[groaning]

43:44.539 --> 43:47.040
Dude.

43:56.009 --> 43:59.594
l probably should have used
someone smarter for this job.

43:59.679 --> 44:00.762
[groaning]

44:04.392 --> 44:05.726
ldiot!

44:06.519 --> 44:07.519
[hooting]

44:15.570 --> 44:17.154
l believe this is the place.

44:30.335 --> 44:33.003
Hello? ls anyone home?

44:33.087 --> 44:36.131
l don't think anybody's here.

44:42.388 --> 44:45.515
Yo, check out this crystal ball, dawgs.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.142
lt's like a giant gumball.

44:47.226 --> 44:49.102
Welcome.

44:49.729 --> 44:53.940
Yo, dawgs, the gumball is talking to us!

44:54.942 --> 44:57.444
- l am Zelda.
- [shouting]

44:57.528 --> 44:59.571
l am all-knowing and all-seeing.

44:59.655 --> 45:04.034
l specialize in the mystic
and otherworldly.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.495
l also do doggy weddings
and doggy bar mitzvahs.

45:06.579 --> 45:09.873
Now, l sense you puppies are in danger.

45:09.957 --> 45:12.292
Only ifwe end up at your groomer.

45:13.419 --> 45:16.046
B-Dawg! l apologize for my brother.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.882
We need your help because
this ghost has been chasing us.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.550
Well, this is Halloween,

45:20.635 --> 45:22.844
the only night spirits are free to roam.

45:22.929 --> 45:25.555
We must make contact
with this ghost of yours.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.724
[gasps] Oh, l have a Ouija board.

45:27.809 --> 45:30.644
lt can be used
to contact the other side.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.907
- Hello?
- [all gasping]

45:43.991 --> 45:46.660
l don't think you're gonna
need your Luigi board.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.078
There's the ghost!

45:48.162 --> 45:51.832
Oh, a ghost! [groaning]

45:54.252 --> 45:56.878
That dudette is down for the count.

45:56.963 --> 45:58.755
Please, l'm not gonna hurt you.

45:58.840 --> 46:02.884
That's what ghosts always say
before they eat you.

46:02.969 --> 46:05.429
Ghosts don't eat.
There's no way for us to.

46:05.513 --> 46:08.098
That's the saddest thing
l've ever heard.

46:08.182 --> 46:10.517
l'm a friendly ghost, l promise.

46:11.686 --> 46:13.353
Oh, my, what a horrible dream.

46:13.438 --> 46:15.897
- l know l look a bit strange.
- Oh!

46:15.982 --> 46:18.275
But l was once a pup just like you.

46:18.359 --> 46:19.568
My name is Pip.

46:19.652 --> 46:21.278
You're the pup from the story.

46:21.362 --> 46:24.030
Yes. l've been like this
ever since that night.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.408
The Hound stole my brothers'
and sisters' souls.

46:26.492 --> 46:28.660
The spell must have been
interrupted that night.

46:28.744 --> 46:30.954
Your soul was left in limbo.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.039
[sniffing]

46:36.544 --> 46:39.296
[soft growling]

46:39.380 --> 46:41.465
l'm sorry l scared you guys
at the Manor.

46:41.549 --> 46:43.967
l was trying to stop you
from releasing the Hound.

46:44.051 --> 46:46.303
Yeah, and we're sorry, too, Pip.

46:46.387 --> 46:48.305
l'm Rosebud, and these are my brothers,

46:48.389 --> 46:51.308
B-Dawg, Mudbud, Buddha and Budderball.

46:51.392 --> 46:53.226
The Hound and Warwick are free.

46:53.311 --> 46:55.604
They're still trying
to finish their spell,

46:55.688 --> 46:58.398
but they need five puppies
of the same blood to do it.

46:58.483 --> 46:59.816
They're after you guys.

46:59.901 --> 47:03.069
We must stop them
from completing the spell.

47:03.154 --> 47:05.238
And Pip, now that you
have left the Manor,

47:05.323 --> 47:08.074
if you do not return
to your body before sunrise,

47:08.159 --> 47:09.910
you will be lost forever.

47:09.994 --> 47:11.328
[gasping]

47:11.412 --> 47:13.955
We must find the body
you once inhabited.

47:14.040 --> 47:18.084
We shall ask the spirits
through my crystal ball.

47:21.172 --> 47:24.090
[deep growling]

47:24.175 --> 47:28.011
[exaggerated voice]
Oh, beautiful and wise one,

47:28.095 --> 47:31.223
we ask for your help
on this night of Halloween.

47:31.307 --> 47:33.683
Please show us this young pup's body.

47:33.768 --> 47:36.603
Does it still exist
on the earthly plane?

47:38.022 --> 47:41.107
That's me! l turned to stone
the night it all happened.

47:41.192 --> 47:44.444
Ah, snap! The cemetery?

47:44.529 --> 47:48.865
l mean, is it really necessary
to go there, dawgs?

47:52.620 --> 47:53.703
[all gasping]

47:54.497 --> 47:56.039
Hello, puppies.

47:56.123 --> 47:58.875
Oh, no! lt's the Howlloween Hound!

47:58.960 --> 48:02.337
Come out, come out,
and l'll have your souls for dinner.

48:02.421 --> 48:04.381
Oh, no. l'm stuck!

48:04.465 --> 48:05.882
The back door, quickly!

48:10.805 --> 48:13.223
Come on! [grunting]

48:17.520 --> 48:19.354
[loud groaning]

48:19.438 --> 48:21.064
- [kids] Mr. Carroll?
- [Billy] Oh, Mr. Carroll!

48:21.148 --> 48:24.150
- Maybe you can help us.
- Give me staff!

48:24.235 --> 48:26.403
That's not normal, even for Mr. Carroll.

48:26.487 --> 48:28.738
- [Pete] That dude's eyes are creepy!
- [all exclaiming]

48:28.823 --> 48:30.740
We better get to that party!
Sheriff Dan's there!

48:30.825 --> 48:32.450
- [Billy] Yeah, come on!
- [Pete] Come on!

48:35.705 --> 48:37.080
Dude.

48:43.045 --> 48:45.088
[singing "Monster Mash"]

49:11.532 --> 49:14.451
Billy! Billy, come on!
Dance with your mom. Whoo!

49:15.703 --> 49:16.620
Whoo!

49:16.704 --> 49:20.498
Mom, l really don't have time right now.
See, there's a monster chasing us.

49:20.583 --> 49:22.709
Of course there is, dear.
lt's Halloween!

49:22.793 --> 49:25.045
- [Mr. Carroll] Give me staff!
- [Billy] There he is.

49:25.129 --> 49:26.796
Run! Run!

49:26.881 --> 49:28.632
Oh, sweetheart, where are you going?

49:28.716 --> 49:30.133
[grunting]

49:30.217 --> 49:32.469
[noisemaker tooting]

49:36.349 --> 49:38.558
[grunting]

49:44.398 --> 49:47.233
[burping] Dude.

49:54.033 --> 49:56.076
[fireworks whistling]

49:57.870 --> 50:01.831
This must be that young Warlock's lair!

50:01.916 --> 50:05.001
lt's swarming with all those creatures.

50:05.086 --> 50:09.255
This warlock is more powerful
than l thought.

50:10.508 --> 50:12.425
[all chattering]

50:13.844 --> 50:14.969
[high-pitched scream]

50:15.054 --> 50:16.346
Hand over the candy.

50:16.430 --> 50:17.972
Stay back, demon!

50:18.057 --> 50:20.016
You'll not trick-or-treat me!

50:20.101 --> 50:21.518
- [grunting]
- [popping]

50:22.853 --> 50:27.774
Wait a minute.
You're no demon!

50:27.858 --> 50:29.109
And you...

50:33.155 --> 50:34.823
...you're no goblin!

50:36.117 --> 50:37.450
You!

50:38.703 --> 50:40.370
- [snapping]
- [shouting]

50:40.454 --> 50:42.163
What kind of trickery is this?

50:42.248 --> 50:44.874
These are just kids in disguises!

50:44.959 --> 50:46.418
Out of my way!

50:46.502 --> 50:49.379
- Let's get outta here!
- Let's get outta here!

50:49.463 --> 50:51.923
[singing "Monster Mash"]

51:00.766 --> 51:03.143
[muffled music]

51:03.227 --> 51:04.894
[Mudbud] Dudes! Sniffer!

51:04.979 --> 51:07.397
He'll know what to do
about that nasty Hound!

51:07.481 --> 51:09.315
[snoring]

51:09.400 --> 51:11.234
Deputy Sniffer!

51:11.318 --> 51:13.236
Wake up! Wake up!
We need your help!

51:13.320 --> 51:16.489
[stammering] Trick-or-treat,
smell my paws.

51:16.574 --> 51:17.866
Yo, dawg!

51:17.950 --> 51:20.577
lt's a straight up 9-1-1 !

51:20.661 --> 51:23.079
[stammering] Buddies,
you startled me there.

51:23.164 --> 51:24.622
What's the problem?

51:24.707 --> 51:28.001
Did someone steal
Budderball's candy bag?

51:28.085 --> 51:30.545
No. This is more serious
than trick-or-treating.

51:30.629 --> 51:32.922
Well, hi there, Zelda.

51:33.007 --> 51:36.593
Deputy Dawg, we got a serious problem.

51:36.677 --> 51:38.887
The Howlloween Hound
has been released!

51:38.971 --> 51:42.599
l sense we have a few hours
before the entire town is doomed,

51:42.683 --> 51:45.185
and soon after that, the whole world!

51:45.269 --> 51:47.771
You're quite the trickster, Zelda.

51:47.855 --> 51:50.106
[chuckling] My great grandpappy Tracker

51:50.191 --> 51:53.443
used to tell me that old wives' tale
when I was just a pup.

51:53.527 --> 51:55.236
Scared the bejesus outta me.

51:55.321 --> 51:59.032
Deputy Sniffer,
l can assure you the legend is true.

52:01.368 --> 52:04.204
Wow, great ghost costume.

52:04.288 --> 52:07.123
lt's not a costume, Deputy Sniffer.
He's a ghost.

52:07.208 --> 52:09.918
See, l can float through walls.

52:10.002 --> 52:11.711
[Sniffer] Oh! Look at...

52:13.422 --> 52:15.089
[stammers]

52:17.343 --> 52:20.762
Whoa! Well, l'll be a monkey's uncle.

52:20.846 --> 52:22.055
My name is Pip.

52:22.139 --> 52:24.933
l knew your great grandpappy,
Deputy Tracker.

52:25.017 --> 52:26.643
We could really use your help.

52:26.727 --> 52:29.562
[sniffing]

52:29.647 --> 52:32.816
Uh, would this hound
happen to be large and brown

52:32.900 --> 52:35.151
and, uh, with green eyes?

52:36.362 --> 52:37.946
Oh, no! He's found us!

52:38.030 --> 52:41.199
The long paw of the law
will handle this intruder.

52:41.283 --> 52:44.285
- You guys go.
- Hurry, we must get to the cemetery.

52:47.206 --> 52:48.498
[weak howling]

52:48.582 --> 52:50.667
Stop in the name of the law!

52:52.670 --> 52:54.170
Time to meet your fate.

52:54.255 --> 52:57.257
- You're under arrest!
- [howling]

52:57.341 --> 52:59.843
What in tarnation do you...

53:04.682 --> 53:07.016
[singing "Monster Mash"]

53:10.437 --> 53:12.272
[giggling]

53:25.119 --> 53:27.662
Oh, there you are, Frank!

53:27.746 --> 53:30.206
You didn't tell me you
left early for the party!

53:30.291 --> 53:32.375
- Uh...
- Come on!

53:32.459 --> 53:35.587
The costume contest is starting
and you're a shoo-in!

53:36.297 --> 53:38.298
- Come on!
- [grunting]

53:43.095 --> 53:47.181
Oh, l love your costume!
You're a wizard, right?

53:47.266 --> 53:51.060
l am a warlock, Madam,
and l'm not wearing a costume!

53:51.145 --> 53:53.730
Now unhand me, you crazy kitty cat!

53:53.814 --> 53:54.731
[shouting]

53:59.153 --> 54:02.697

- [Dan] OK, all right.

54:02.781 --> 54:05.074

54:07.328 --> 54:11.414
for the finalists

54:14.126 --> 54:17.170
OK, you've got your numbers.

54:20.758 --> 54:22.800
[panting]

54:24.303 --> 54:26.429
[Dan] All right, make a nice,
clean line, please.

54:26.513 --> 54:28.932
Sheriff! Sheriff.
l've really gotta talk to you.

54:29.016 --> 54:30.099
lt's really, really important.

54:30.184 --> 54:31.267
ln a jiffy, Billy.

54:31.352 --> 54:32.852

all right?

54:32.937 --> 54:33.853
But, Sheriff!

54:33.938 --> 54:35.104
Ladies and gentlemen,

54:35.189 --> 54:37.815
the first place winner is...

54:37.900 --> 54:40.026
- ...drum roll, please.
- [drum roll]

54:41.195 --> 54:43.780
The winner is...

54:43.864 --> 54:46.407
...Frank Carroll! Frankendude!

54:46.492 --> 54:47.742
[shouting]

54:47.826 --> 54:51.955
- Move!
- Honey, that's great!

54:52.039 --> 54:53.831
Useless monster!

54:53.916 --> 54:55.708
Must l do everything myself?

54:56.794 --> 54:59.379
Staff! [grunting]

55:01.382 --> 55:03.299
Say "cheese"!

Somebody had a bit too much
spooky punch!

55:15.729 --> 55:17.063
[crowd laughing]

55:17.147 --> 55:18.606
Oh, honey, are you OK?

55:18.691 --> 55:20.775
You know that story about the warlock?

55:20.859 --> 55:23.736
Hypothetically speaking,
could Warwick return to Fernfield

55:23.821 --> 55:26.280
even if it was, like, 75 years ago?

55:26.365 --> 55:28.074
Billy, it's Halloween!

55:28.158 --> 55:31.327
All the scariest monsters
return this time of year.

55:31.412 --> 55:33.329
Give the staff to me, boy!

55:33.414 --> 55:35.832
lt belongs to me, Warwick,

55:35.916 --> 55:38.626
the greatest warlock of all time!

55:38.711 --> 55:40.336
l've gotta return that to Sheriff Dan!

55:40.421 --> 55:42.797
What have you done with my book?

55:42.881 --> 55:46.843
Now, sir!
That, my friend, is a party foul!

55:46.927 --> 55:49.262
Unhand that boy!
Enough monkey business!

55:49.346 --> 55:50.513
[grunting]

55:51.765 --> 55:53.641
Monkey business, eh?

55:53.726 --> 55:55.268
- [all] Let's go!

55:55.936 --> 55:58.730
Transformius monchius!

55:58.814 --> 56:00.690
[crowd gasping, applauding]

56:00.774 --> 56:02.817
What in tarnation? [chittering]

56:02.901 --> 56:05.069
- [gasping]
- You're under arrest

56:05.154 --> 56:07.697

56:30.929 --> 56:32.722
- [hiccuping]
- [crowd laughing]

56:35.392 --> 56:37.226
But it's better to be feared!

56:37.311 --> 56:38.978
[evil laughter]

56:40.898 --> 56:41.898
[Mrs. Carroll] Wow!

56:41.982 --> 56:43.691
That was amazing.

OK, well, uh, l have to confess.

58:59.953 --> 59:01.245

l've never really returned
a spirit to a body, per se.

You're the boy from the legend.

Mr. Hound, l am Zelda.

l am all-knowing and all-seeing.

01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:07.890
l specialize in the mystic
and otherworldly.

l believe l can help you
come from the dark

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:13.229

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:17.900

Now get out of my way.

- Hoot.
- [grunting]

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:28.160
Go tell that idiot Warwick
l've captured the puppies.

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:33.916
Now, l have a different plan
for you pups.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.501
We're doomed!

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:42.007
For 75 years l held onto this book...

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:46.262
...dreading a full moon
on Halloween night.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:51.016
lt's the only night Warwick could return
to finish the spell.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.772
They have my book!

01:02:57.983 --> 01:03:00.109
How do l get my hands on it?

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:06.615
[Billy] Whoa, what's up with this book?

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.492
The writing's all trippy.

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:11.078
lt's Latin. l learned the language

01:03:11.163 --> 01:03:13.372
and studied the book
from cover to cover,

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:17.543
trying to decipher its meaning,
so l could stop Warwick.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.879
So, what's the book say, Mr. Johnson?

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:24.925
Warwick will need three items
to complete the spell tonight

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.971
for the evil spirits
of the netherworld to remain here.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:30.931
The nether-what now?

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:34.685
That's another name
for a place where ghosts live,

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:36.562
usually bad ones.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.648
Halloween is the one night

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:43.986
these spirits can roam free
in our world.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:47.490
Only the Howlloween Hound
can call them out.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.409
Warwick will use those spirits

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:54.038
to control the townsfolk of Fernfield.

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:57.249
But you said he needs three things,
right?

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.834
That's right.

01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:02.588
His staff, the spell book...

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:05.841
...and one other thing.

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:08.886
Well, what is it?

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:16.352
The souls of five young puppies
who share the same blood.

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.189
Like brothers and sisters?

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:23.734
[all] The Buddies!

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:27.238

Hound has captured the five puppies.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:32.660
Perfect!

01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:35.746
Those puppies will come in handy

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:37.831
in more ways than one.

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:39.458

01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:02.356
Good work, Hound.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.567
Now all l need is my book.

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:07.570
You take these puppies
back to the Manor

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:09.863
and l will meet you there.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:11.782
[laughter, hiccuping]

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:28.215
Open wide like the jaws of a dragon!

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:33.345
You in there!

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.890
l have something you want.

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:40.436
Yo, dawgs, it's that creepy old warlock!

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.771
lf you want to see your puppies again,

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:45.566
you better bring that book to my Manor!

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:46.859
[laughing]

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:55.743
Oh, no, they've got the Buddies!

01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:58.078
Yeah, but what if they're
just trying to trick us?

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:01.749
You really want to take that chance,
dude? l wouldn't.

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:20.017
l told those wretched children
to bring me my spell book.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.646
What if they don't come with the book?

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:27.316
Quiet, you moronic birdbrain.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.485
They will want to save

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:33.739
their precious puppies, won't they?

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:36.241
[evil laughter, hiccuping]

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:45.751
Mr. Johnson, what happens
ifwe can't stop them?

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:50.381
Then the spirits will be
under Warwick's control forever.

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:52.466
They'll take over Fernfield first,

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.718
and who knows what they'll do next?

01:06:54.803 --> 01:06:57.471
Yeah, that's definitely not good.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:01.600
We have to put an end to this tonight,
for all time.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.771
[muffled music]

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:09.024
[squeaking]

01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:16.699
What are you dudes up to?

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:18.534
We're gonna get that dirty rat.

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.619
Hey, l resent that comment.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:23.872
Come on, or you'll be a dirty rat
for the rest of your life.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:26.333
Ready to exact some revenge!

01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:33.882
Soon, they will be here
with my spell book,

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:37.511
and you can devour those...

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.515
...delicious puppy souls.

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:44.727
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:45.894
Oh, what is it?

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:47.980
Something is biting me! Ow!

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:51.608
Quickly, Hound,
Hoot do something! Ow!

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:55.404
[shouting]

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:59.032
Yo, now that dawg
has some serious moves.

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.416
Vermin!

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.001
You ain't seen nothing yet.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.753
Change us back, you jerk!

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:12.087
Run for it, dude!

01:08:12.964 --> 01:08:14.757
Back off, you vermin!

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.926
[squeaking]

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:21.305
Hound! Get them!

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:28.060
l'll get that book
from those stupid kids!

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:30.564
Our kids are here?
Oh, no!

01:08:32.192 --> 01:08:33.524
You guard the puppies.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:34.777
Yes, Master.

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:40.198
Fail me, and l'll turn you
into a feather duster.

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:57.758
Psst, Buddies.

01:08:57.841 --> 01:08:58.801
Pip!

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:00.260
We have to get you out of here.

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:02.763
[hooting] What do you
think you're doing?

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:04.555
l'm saving my friends.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.267
l can't let them escape.
Master would be furious.

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:10.437
Hoot, why are you so loyal to Warwick?

01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:12.064
Seriously, dude!

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:15.149
lt's totally obvious he plans
to get rid of you.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:18.779
Master sometimes gets angry,
but he would never get rid of me.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.072
He needs me!

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:22.198
Yo, are you hallucinatrippin'?

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:25.368
He's got that Howlloween Hound
to do his dirty work now.

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:29.122
Man, he calls you names
like moronic birdbrain.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.500
That does sound like something he'd say.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:34.962
You have a conscience,
but yet you have spent your whole life

01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:37.840
being bossed around by someone
who doesn't respect you.

01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:39.966
What do you know?

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:42.010
l know you never meant to hurt us, Hoot.

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:45.848
And even though you've been
under Warwick's control for a long time,

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:49.017
you still have a chance
at a happy life in this beautiful world.

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:52.312
But if Warwick wins,
we'll all be doomed.

01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:54.815
Haven't the last 75 years without evil

01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:57.526
been a lot nicer than your time
under Warwick's wing?

01:09:57.610 --> 01:10:01.113
lt was kind of nice not having to look
over my shoulder all the time.

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:12.666
You won't regret it, Hoot.
l promise.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:15.544

dogs at every town you visit

and tell us which one's the best.

01:24:50.127 --> 01:24:51.711
Have a great time, Pip.
