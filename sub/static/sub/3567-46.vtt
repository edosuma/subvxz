00:01.678 --> 00:04.443
<i> ~ Fora Temer ~</i>

00:06.774 --> 00:08.096
<i>Whoo!</i>

00:08.232 --> 00:10.266
- That sounded great!
- Aw, thanks.

00:10.317 --> 00:12.652
I'm thinking about calling it
"Water witch."

00:12.736 --> 00:15.271
- Cool!
- And check this out.

00:15.356 --> 00:17.573
I can add some vocal distortion, too.

00:17.708 --> 00:20.910
<i>Steven, your dad's a robot now.</i>

00:20.995 --> 00:24.864
<i>And now that I'm a robot,
things will be better and colder.</i>

00:24.948 --> 00:28.368
<i>Please forgive me for
being an amazing machine.</i>

00:28.452 --> 00:30.503
I can't stay mad at my Robo Dad!

00:30.587 --> 00:32.622
Where's all this awesome
energy coming from?

00:32.803 --> 00:35.263
Actually, I was inspired
to make some new songs

00:35.264 --> 00:37.723
after the ocean got sucked
up into space a while back.

00:37.758 --> 00:39.926
I even drew up some
freaky album artwork.

00:40.010 --> 00:43.396
It looks like...
Lapis Lazuli.

00:43.430 --> 00:47.598
Easy with the tender touches.
Don't want it to get all smudged.

00:47.633 --> 00:50.853
Here, plug this up and help your
old man work out this witchy jam.

00:50.938 --> 00:53.356
Yeah!
L-e-e-et's jam!

00:54.884 --> 00:59.097
- Uh... where my jams at?
- I don't think it's plugged in.

00:59.132 --> 01:03.583
Aha!
Boop! All right.

01:03.650 --> 01:07.162
Here we go!
L-e-e-et's jam!

01:07.197 --> 01:10.423
Uh... Hmm.
Jam!

01:10.507 --> 01:13.626
- Mm. J-a-a-a-am!
- Oh! Sorry.

01:13.710 --> 01:15.711
That's just the TV. See?

01:15.796 --> 01:18.548
You plugged into the video jack.
We're making audio here.

01:18.632 --> 01:22.552
Don't you know?
"Video killed the audio star."

01:22.636 --> 01:25.521
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:25.606 --> 01:28.024
That's okay.
You leave the details to me.

01:28.108 --> 01:30.643
When you're a one-man band, you
got to know how to do it all ...

01:30.777 --> 01:33.479
lyrics, graphic design,
forum moderation.

01:33.714 --> 01:35.881
But for me it was all about the audio!

01:35.966 --> 01:38.517
What a lovely poem.

01:38.602 --> 01:40.553
Okay!
We need a catchy hook ...

01:40.637 --> 01:43.689
Something like...
# Well, she's a riptide queen #

01:43.774 --> 01:47.143
- # and she's super-mean #
- Whoa. Hold the phone.

01:47.194 --> 01:50.479
Now give the phone to me.
Lapis was not mean.

01:50.564 --> 01:53.699
She was just trying to get home.
How about this instead?

01:53.784 --> 01:57.119
♪ She was trapped in a mirror ♪
♪ and it couldn't be clearer ♪

01:57.154 --> 01:58.988
♪ she wanted to leave this place ♪

01:59.122 --> 02:01.040
♪ and get herself back in space ♪

02:01.158 --> 02:04.493
♪ and, dad, you might think
she's a criminal ♪

02:04.628 --> 02:08.163
♪ but her friendship comes
through subliminal ♪

02:08.247 --> 02:10.348
<i>♪ Lapis Lazuli ♪</i>

02:10.350 --> 02:15.780
<i>♪ you fled into the bottom of the sea ♪</i>

02:15.781 --> 02:17.973
<i>♪ Lapis Lazuli ♪</i>

02:18.058 --> 02:22.728
<i>♪ you were so mad, but
then you came around to me ♪</i>

02:23.246 --> 02:25.765
Uh, what the heck is that?!

02:25.849 --> 02:28.184
Must be some kind of weird feedback.

02:28.251 --> 02:30.686
Hmm...
It's not us.

02:30.737 --> 02:32.021
I think it's coming from the temple.

02:32.155 --> 02:34.940
- Let's check it out.
- Uh, you go on ahead.

02:35.025 --> 02:37.660
If this is a gem thing, I
don't want to get in the way.

02:37.694 --> 02:39.779
<i>Plus, I got to eat
the rest of this pizza.</i>

02:39.863 --> 02:41.997
Good thinking!
I'll be back.

02:43.637 --> 02:47.987
- Ow! What's happening?!
- It's the wailing stone!

02:48.021 --> 02:51.023
- Make it stop!
- It just activated on its own!

02:51.107 --> 02:54.026
It won't shut off!

03:02.369 --> 03:04.920
Stand back!

03:05.005 --> 03:07.206
Huh? It worked!

03:07.290 --> 03:10.273
Now we can ...

03:16.683 --> 03:20.219
<i>Bwaaaaaah!</i>

03:27.227 --> 03:30.112
I don't understand.
That thing has lain dormant

03:30.196 --> 03:33.190
- since we found it.
- I haven't heard a wailing stone

03:33.225 --> 03:35.317
activate since we used
them for the rebellion.

03:35.402 --> 03:38.237
And I've never
heard it sound like that!

03:38.321 --> 03:40.539
Someone is trying to
send us a message.

03:40.573 --> 03:42.699
But who?
We've rounded up all

03:42.734 --> 03:45.357
the wailing stones on Earth,
and we're not sending

03:45.385 --> 03:48.714
this signal to ourselves!
Unless...

03:48.748 --> 03:51.967
- Amethyst, is this a prank?!
- No way!

03:52.052 --> 03:56.138
I want it to stop!
I don't like it!

03:56.222 --> 03:58.724
If it's not coming
from Earth, then a gem must be

03:58.758 --> 04:01.977
- sending this message from space.
- Is that... what some

04:02.062 --> 04:04.263
- gems sound like?
- No, no.

04:04.347 --> 04:07.516
We should be hearing a voice.
Maybe this signal is too

04:07.600 --> 04:09.818
advanced for the
wailing stone to process.

04:09.903 --> 04:12.988
That would explain the distorted audio.

04:13.106 --> 04:16.608
Audio?
My Daddio knows audio!

04:16.660 --> 04:18.944
- Eh, you mean Greg?
- Yeah.

04:18.995 --> 04:22.990
- I don't know.
- Don't whine. Let's try it.

04:22.991 --> 04:25.909
I can't believe it!
You need help with sound stuff?

04:25.910 --> 04:27.619
You've come to the right guy!

04:27.704 --> 04:30.172
Aha! The Lubitz cardioid condenser 680!

04:30.256 --> 04:32.624
It's got warm tones without too

04:32.676 --> 04:34.793
- much top-end.
- Uh, plus it's got

04:34.878 --> 04:39.014
- a big honkin' sponge thing.
- I know! Isn't it awesome?

04:41.267 --> 04:43.969
Now I'm gonna add some reverb

04:44.037 --> 04:46.805
and some low-octave effects.
I'm also adding some fuzz,

04:46.890 --> 04:48.974
'cause who couldn't use more fuzz?

04:49.059 --> 04:51.727
Now, if I directly input the
wailing stone and run it through

04:51.811 --> 04:53.979
a flanger, we might get what
you're looking for.

04:54.114 --> 04:57.158
Flangers aside, do
you really think a signal

04:57.159 --> 05:00.202
like this is compatible
with your analog devices?

05:00.320 --> 05:02.154
Don't worry, Dad.

05:02.155 --> 05:03.989
<i> It'll work!</i>

05:04.040 --> 05:07.076
Well, here goes nothin'.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.995
- This is even worse!
- I'm sorry!

05:10.046 --> 05:13.632
Dad, you can do it!
You're the audio daddio!

05:13.666 --> 05:18.721
Yeah!

05:20.015 --> 05:24.176
It ... It sounds
like... music.

05:24.227 --> 05:26.879
Yeah!
That's real nice.

05:26.946 --> 05:29.264
Yes! Yes!

05:29.349 --> 05:32.785
- Whoo-hoo!
- But it's not supposed

05:32.852 --> 05:36.255
to be music.
It's supposed to be a message.

05:36.322 --> 05:38.557
Okay, hold on.
I got this.

05:40.547 --> 05:44.596
- It's... changing!
- It almost sounds like a voice.

05:44.664 --> 05:47.166
Almost got it!

05:49.452 --> 05:51.486
Ugh! Oh, great.

05:51.587 --> 05:53.989
What's happening?
Where's the signal?

05:54.057 --> 05:56.958
Uh, looks like the van
battery couldn't handle all this.

05:57.043 --> 06:00.962
I had a feeling this wouldn't work.
There's just no way Greg's

06:01.064 --> 06:04.066
equipment can interface with our
ancient gem technology.

06:04.167 --> 06:07.219
Aw, come on, Pearl!
You can't be ready to give up yet!

06:07.303 --> 06:11.473
Look, we just got to keep trying.
Sure, we don't have the latest

06:11.557 --> 06:15.477
and greatest "gem tech" but...

06:15.528 --> 06:17.863
It's okay, Greg.
You tried.

06:17.947 --> 06:20.816
Back to the temple.
We'll figure something else out.

06:20.867 --> 06:24.683
- What a waste of time.
- See ya later, Gregory.

06:24.821 --> 06:28.098
Aw, come on, y'all!
Hup! Oof!

06:32.462 --> 06:37.482

There's got to be
something else we can try.

07:38.311 --> 07:42.447
Eh, I don't know, Steven.
I mean, sound and stuff like this?

07:42.532 --> 07:44.783
This stuff's my whole world.

07:44.867 --> 07:49.220
And if I can't figure this out, then...
maybe it isn't even sound.

07:49.255 --> 07:54.826
But, Dad, if it isn't sound, then...
what else could it be?

07:54.911 --> 07:59.498
Hmm...
Hmm...

07:59.582 --> 08:01.216
Wait.

D-a-a-a-ad!

08:05.838 --> 08:07.556
I'm not that far away from you, buddy.

08:07.590 --> 08:10.768
- What if it's...
- Uh, some other thing

08:10.794 --> 08:15.263
I'm not good at?
Magic...

08:15.314 --> 08:17.933
eyeballs?
Oh, my days! It's video!

08:18.017 --> 08:19.768
We have to tell the gems!

08:19.852 --> 08:23.438
<i>- Vide-o-o-o-o!
- Hey! Slow down!</i>

08:23.523 --> 08:25.841
I just want to help!

08:25.908 --> 08:28.210
Have some faith in ...

08:28.277 --> 08:30.045
- We over here.
- I know my audio equipment

08:30.112 --> 08:32.080
seems like a pile of Earth
junk to y'all, but I ...

08:32.181 --> 08:35.283
- Greg, it's okay.
- No, it's not!

08:35.351 --> 08:38.220
You guys don't give up on
anything ... except for me!

08:38.287 --> 08:42.289
Come on! It's not like
I can make it any worse!

08:44.327 --> 08:47.179
Go for it, Garnet.

08:47.296 --> 08:50.215
- Okay, Amethyst, try it now.
- Never started a car

08:50.299 --> 08:52.585
with a key before.

08:53.436 --> 08:55.720
That's way easier!

08:55.805 --> 08:57.138
The battery's ready to go.

08:57.223 --> 08:58.807
The wailing stone's ready!

08:58.891 --> 09:01.009
Ready with the video cord, Steven?

09:01.077 --> 09:03.530
Ready!

09:07.183 --> 09:10.519
- Is that it?
- Just a second...

09:10.586 --> 09:16.108
I ... I hear something.

09:16.109 --> 09:17.726
Come on...

09:19.996 --> 09:21.930
<i>- Steven!
- Lapis?</i>

09:21.998 --> 09:23.465
- I did it!
- I can't believe my

09:23.566 --> 09:25.500
- flipping eyes!
- Everyone, listen up!

09:25.601 --> 09:27.369
<i>I hope you're able to hear this.</i>

09:27.436 --> 09:29.271
<i>There's a gem that's looking for you.</i>

09:29.338 --> 09:32.374
<i>She even knew your name.
I don't know how ...</i>

09:32.441 --> 09:36.177
<i>I didn't tell her, I swear!
She's on her way to Earth.</i>

09:36.229 --> 09:40.348
<i>And she's not alone!
Steven, home world...</i>

09:40.433 --> 09:45.020
<i>it's not the way it used to be.
Everything here is so advanced!</i>

09:45.104 --> 09:48.406
<i>I can't even understand it!
There's no way anything on Earth</i>

09:48.491 --> 09:51.993
<i>can stand up to it!
Please don't put up a fight!</i>

09:52.028 --> 09:54.726
<i>It will only lead to devastation!</i>

09:56.449 --> 10:00.369
It's Peridot. She must
be talking about Peridot.

10:00.404 --> 10:03.538
- She's coming for us!
- Lapis...

10:03.673 --> 10:07.318
- she sounds so unhappy.
- I really cannot believe...

10:07.353 --> 10:10.045
<i>Seriously bad news!
What are we gonna do?</i>

10:10.129 --> 10:11.930
- Whew!
- Wha?

10:12.014 --> 10:14.049
- We did it.
- What?!

10:14.100 --> 10:16.268
- We got the message.
- But ...

10:16.352 --> 10:18.563
It's got.

10:23.709 --> 10:26.278
Thank you, Greg.
We would not have received this

10:26.362 --> 10:30.114
- message without your help.
- You ... You're welcome.

10:30.147 --> 10:33.382
<i>My Dad is...
the best!</i>

10:33.384 --> 10:36.318
Oh, my gosh!
Steven's a robot! Help!

10:36.320 --> 10:39.021
I can't relate to my robot son!
