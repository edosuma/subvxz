"MODIGLIANI"

01:18.620 --> 01:21.288
Do you know what love is?

01:22.916 --> 01:25.250
Real love?

01:29.089 --> 01:32.674
Have you ever loved so deeply...

01:32.842 --> 01:37.262
that you would condemn
yourself to eternity in hell

01:38.681 --> 01:40.599
I have

02:10.130 --> 02:20.556
Lionel, my friend, you may be
the most handsome boy of Romania

02:22.016 --> 02:27.646
Yes, we have to admit it

02:27.856 --> 02:31.984
You have a funny habit

02:32.986 --> 02:35.571
Lionel thank you

02:35.738 --> 02:38.448
Lionel you have the choice

02:38.449 --> 02:40.617
The pretty girl

02:40.785 --> 02:43.620
Miss Darobelle, as well as Lopez

02:51.212 --> 02:58.677
Lionel thank you

02:58.845 --> 03:00.846
Lionel you have the choice

03:01.014 --> 03:01.763
Lionel!

03:01.931 --> 03:03.515
Fifty nine seconds

03:04.184 --> 03:07.895
Soup......And beef

03:11.774 --> 03:13.275
Andre!

03:15.069 --> 03:17.487
Dinner for
everyone is on me!

03:19.032 --> 03:22.659
You haven't signed it

03:23.369 --> 03:27.122
I said I'm buying dinner...
..not the restaurant

03:31.544 --> 03:32.711
Well Pablo?

03:33.254 --> 03:34.588
Will you?

03:34.797 --> 03:36.924
Competition? Us?

03:36.925 --> 03:38.675
We are all geniuses

03:38.676 --> 03:39.426
For the moment

03:39.594 --> 03:41.011
If Picasso doesn't enter...

03:41.221 --> 03:44.681
I Diego Rivera... I win it again

03:44.849 --> 03:45.682
I thought he was barred

03:45.850 --> 03:48.310
Maybe.
- l thought he was dead

04:18.091 --> 04:19.757
Jeanne?

04:19.926 --> 04:22.886
What in God's name
do you think you are doing?

04:24.180 --> 04:26.265
He needs to see his daughter

04:26.432 --> 04:29.726
No one should see that bastard Jew child

04:29.727 --> 04:31.478
You will come home now

04:31.479 --> 04:35.148
And if you don't obey this moment.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.943
You will leave me no alternative.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.112
You can't take my baby away from me

04:40.363 --> 04:41.989
You are my daughter.

04:42.156 --> 04:45.367
I can do anything

04:48.371 --> 04:50.330
Five thousand francs

04:51.332 --> 04:53.500
Huh, may as well be five million

04:59.132 --> 05:01.925
Well ...Mmm. Steak. Rare

05:18.526 --> 05:19.693
good evening all

05:19.902 --> 05:21.528
good evening, Modigliani

05:21.696 --> 05:24.656
Tonight! I walked across a bridge

05:24.657 --> 05:27.159
Tonight I walked across a bridge

05:27.368 --> 05:31.163
But there was no bridge there

05:31.372 --> 05:34.916
I carried a bagful of love

05:35.084 --> 05:38.378
But no one to share it with

05:38.546 --> 05:41.965
And then...I thought of you

05:42.133 --> 05:44.176
Ah! all of you!

05:45.678 --> 05:50.390
Love!

05:52.435 --> 05:54.853
We don't have to look any further

05:55.021 --> 05:58.815
The future of art...is in a woman's face

06:01.069 --> 06:02.027
Beautiful

06:02.236 --> 06:02.986
Beautiful!

06:03.154 --> 06:04.571
The famous Picasso!

06:04.739 --> 06:06.031
Picasso!

06:06.240 --> 06:07.282
Tell me Pablo

06:07.450 --> 06:10.160
How do you make love to a cube?

06:11.412 --> 06:20.212
Pablo!
Pablo! Pablo!

06:41.275 --> 06:46.988
Hello, Pablo.
Do you miss me?

06:54.163 --> 06:55.497
Philipe!

07:03.756 --> 07:05.465
I've had enough

07:05.633 --> 07:06.258
Picasso!

07:06.467 --> 07:08.468
Oh Thank you

07:10.430 --> 07:10.929
Good work!

07:11.139 --> 07:13.223
Why do you hate me so much?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.100
I love you Pablo

07:15.268 --> 07:17.060
It's myself. I hate

07:23.526 --> 07:26.653
Good evening

07:27.196 --> 07:31.450
Water... water.
Music!

07:33.077 --> 07:34.953
Do you want anything?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.539
A gun

07:51.137 --> 07:52.971
So how did we do?

07:55.975 --> 07:58.768
Sooner or later somebody'll catch on

07:59.979 --> 08:02.397
Get out of Paris Modi, you need sun

08:02.565 --> 08:03.398
And let you starve?

08:03.566 --> 08:05.692
I don't think I could
have that on my conscience

08:05.860 --> 08:07.694
Good evening

08:09.238 --> 08:11.114
Modi? What about the food?

08:11.282 --> 08:13.575
I have a date with Beatrice

08:33.596 --> 08:36.181
You can't change destiny

08:36.390 --> 08:38.265
What destiny?

08:38.267 --> 08:42.270
Hers. To be with him

09:07.922 --> 09:10.215
You must stay here

09:20.935 --> 09:22.435
Come here

09:23.646 --> 09:25.146
There

09:25.314 --> 09:27.440
But this animal is mad

09:28.150 --> 09:30.068
Attends, attends

09:31.320 --> 09:38.785
There. There. Gently. Gently

09:38.953 --> 09:41.830
Yeah it's ok

10:05.771 --> 10:06.646
She is stupid!

10:06.856 --> 10:09.357
Bella. Calme

10:09.358 --> 10:11.484
Bella

10:11.652 --> 10:13.278
Bella!

10:25.374 --> 10:27.125
Bravo!

10:48.022 --> 10:52.400
Jeanne

10:53.235 --> 10:55.403
How do you know my name?

10:56.656 --> 10:58.865
I had to

10:59.033 --> 10:59.574
Amedeo...

10:59.784 --> 11:01.660
Modigliani. I know who you are

11:01.827 --> 11:03.286
We all know who you are

11:03.454 --> 11:06.164
Even the dog knew who you were

11:06.415 --> 11:08.792
Come. I want to see you in the rain

11:10.044 --> 11:11.878
Don't be frightened

11:13.255 --> 11:15.006
I love the rain

11:15.174 --> 11:17.425
I love what it says

11:17.426 --> 11:19.135
How interesting

11:19.303 --> 11:20.595
Now the rain speaks

11:20.805 --> 11:21.763
Yes

11:21.931 --> 11:23.181
And what does it say

11:23.349 --> 11:25.266
It says you need a hat

11:27.186 --> 11:28.895
Thank you

11:30.314 --> 11:32.565
But first you have to show me
your drawing

11:32.733 --> 11:34.442
No

11:34.610 --> 11:36.820
No... I'm not an artist

11:36.987 --> 11:38.279
You let me be thejudge of that

11:38.447 --> 11:40.073
No

11:40.074 --> 11:42.742
No drawing. No hat

11:44.203 --> 11:44.994
Ok

11:45.162 --> 11:46.579
The hat first

11:46.747 --> 11:48.206
Hat first

12:14.233 --> 12:15.316
Is this how you see me?

12:15.484 --> 12:19.863
It's... it's how everybody sees Modigliani

12:24.952 --> 12:26.786
I'm sorry

12:30.916 --> 12:32.959
Call me Modi

12:35.087 --> 12:36.921
Ok Modi

12:39.967 --> 12:41.342
Now I will paint you

12:41.510 --> 12:44.220
You come and see me
and I will paint you

12:44.388 --> 12:46.139
And if I'm lucky one day...

12:46.348 --> 12:48.141
What?

12:49.852 --> 12:52.353
I will paint your eyes

12:53.355 --> 12:55.648
With your reputation

12:55.649 --> 12:57.692
You think I'm crazy?

12:57.902 --> 12:59.819
Yes

13:23.594 --> 13:25.428
What do you think?

13:27.556 --> 13:29.682
Where are my eyes?

13:40.152 --> 13:42.737
I was too far away
I couldn't see them

14:02.383 --> 14:05.510
When I know your soul
I'll paint your eyes

14:31.161 --> 14:33.746
Look at daddy's work

14:35.457 --> 14:36.249
You're very late Monsieur

14:36.417 --> 14:37.125
Yes... yes

14:37.293 --> 14:39.252
Mademoiselle Hastings is waiting for you

14:40.504 --> 14:42.171
Scusi

14:42.339 --> 14:44.883
Ah bella!

14:45.050 --> 14:47.635
Oh you have beautiful bones

14:47.803 --> 14:48.761
I can paint you

14:48.929 --> 14:49.762
Ten francs

14:49.972 --> 14:51.472
Talk to Martinez

14:51.640 --> 14:54.559
The one and only Martinez

14:59.773 --> 15:01.232
You keep me waiting

15:01.400 --> 15:02.901
Not nice at all

15:03.068 --> 15:04.402
Now come and meet Foster Kane

15:04.570 --> 15:07.280
He's got a lot of money and no taste

15:07.990 --> 15:08.573
I'm a buyer

15:08.782 --> 15:10.074
And even though you
kept me waiting...

15:10.242 --> 15:15.288
I think your paintings are... Interesting

15:17.666 --> 15:19.667
Interesting?

15:20.544 --> 15:24.005
Mr Kane owns the biggest
galleries in New York

15:26.592 --> 15:28.343
Really?

15:31.013 --> 15:33.473
Biggest galleries in New York?
Interesting

15:33.682 --> 15:34.599
That's funny

15:34.600 --> 15:37.185
Like you said... a lot of money...

15:37.353 --> 15:39.687
But no taste

15:40.856 --> 15:43.316
Very funny

15:53.702 --> 15:55.244
Modigliani!

15:55.871 --> 15:58.748
How dare you embarrass me?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.500
Where you going?

16:11.887 --> 16:13.763
Go back to your sheep

16:13.973 --> 16:15.223
If you walk away

16:15.391 --> 16:17.183
don't come back

16:17.393 --> 16:19.769
Farewell Martinez

16:45.004 --> 16:46.587
There. Good

16:50.175 --> 16:51.759
I'll do more

16:51.927 --> 16:53.636
They're arriving this morning

17:32.968 --> 17:34.552
Search the house!

17:38.432 --> 17:46.814
that family Modigliani is in arrears and
back taxes....owed to the Republica Italia

17:46.982 --> 17:54.280
It is therefore stated
or otherwise that can

17:54.490 --> 17:59.285
be sold for the purpose of retrieving

17:59.495 --> 18:00.953
Ancient law of Italy states...

18:01.121 --> 18:08.127
Whatever a pregnant women has on her bed
she can be keep

18:08.337 --> 18:10.004
We claim this right

18:10.172 --> 18:12.090
I thought you Jews
were never poor

18:12.257 --> 18:13.508
Disgraceful

18:13.675 --> 18:15.009
Son of a bitch

18:15.177 --> 18:16.219
Eugenia!

18:16.386 --> 18:17.220
Not yet!

18:17.387 --> 18:19.847
Are you not going to write down
everything we have on the bed?

18:20.015 --> 18:22.183
Don't worry. I intend to do so

18:22.351 --> 18:23.476
Five chairs

18:23.644 --> 18:24.769
Kiss Mummy

18:25.020 --> 18:28.314
Two chandeliers

18:28.482 --> 18:32.026
Two tables

18:32.027 --> 18:35.780
Three blankets

18:35.781 --> 18:39.784
Four paintings

18:39.785 --> 18:42.537
One large mirror

18:44.039 --> 18:47.583
one vase

18:47.751 --> 18:52.046
Two carpets. Two carpets

18:52.214 --> 18:56.217
Two lamps. Two lamps

18:56.385 --> 18:58.553
One sewing machine. sewing machine

19:00.180 --> 19:02.223
Chanukah

19:06.395 --> 19:08.020
And Mamma

19:09.565 --> 19:11.315
Papa

19:15.070 --> 19:16.779
Grandpapa

19:28.375 --> 19:29.959
Jeanne

19:30.169 --> 19:34.547
I baptise you in the name of the father

19:34.715 --> 19:39.844
and of the son.
and of the holy spirit

19:40.012 --> 19:43.347
Amen. Amen

20:00.240 --> 20:02.200
Help me father

20:02.409 --> 20:04.785
What have I done wrong?

20:04.953 --> 20:07.163
I fell in love

20:07.331 --> 20:09.248
Is that a sin?

20:09.416 --> 20:11.751
No my dear Jeanne

20:11.919 --> 20:15.421
The sin would be to never
have loved at all

20:15.631 --> 20:18.591
I don't know what to do

20:19.801 --> 20:22.220
I don't know what I want

20:23.597 --> 20:28.309
I miss him

20:28.477 --> 20:30.978
I can't lose him

20:31.939 --> 20:34.565
Why does one man hate another...

20:34.733 --> 20:36.943
just because of his faith?

20:37.110 --> 20:40.529
The church doesn't hate Modi,
does it father?

20:40.697 --> 20:43.741
The church is not the enemy here

20:44.660 --> 20:47.286
Your faith is not the enemy

20:47.454 --> 20:50.498
You must be strong for you

20:50.666 --> 20:52.959
and for the baby

21:00.175 --> 21:02.093
Jeanne?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.553
It is for the best,
you will see my dear

21:04.721 --> 21:09.767
The world is a cruel place for a child
who bears... a stigma

21:23.198 --> 21:25.658
Jeanne! Jeanne!

21:25.867 --> 21:27.326
Jeanne! Stop... stop... stop

21:27.494 --> 21:29.704
Look at me! Look at me!

21:29.871 --> 21:32.581
You... stupid girl

21:32.749 --> 21:35.543
You are a child.
You do not know what you are doing

21:35.711 --> 21:37.003
And do you?

21:37.212 --> 21:40.423
Do you know
what you are doing? Papa?

21:40.590 --> 21:44.885
Remember what you did? Remember?

22:17.586 --> 22:20.838
Poor bastards.
They don't even know what they fight for

22:21.006 --> 22:24.383
Diego, they're not supposed to, ha?

22:32.559 --> 22:33.976
Stop the car!

22:37.356 --> 22:38.064
Modigliani!

22:38.231 --> 22:39.190
Oh God!

22:44.780 --> 22:46.947
You do not walk out on me

22:47.115 --> 22:49.200
I walk out on you

22:49.368 --> 22:50.534
For the damage

22:50.702 --> 22:52.453
Buy everyone a drink

22:52.621 --> 22:53.746
But not the Italian

22:53.955 --> 22:55.915
I've stopped paying for him

22:58.919 --> 23:00.419
Drive on Stan

23:15.977 --> 23:17.311
Oh wonderful!

23:17.479 --> 23:18.604
That's a nice arse

23:19.314 --> 23:20.856
get off me

23:34.079 --> 23:36.288
I think she's over there

23:36.498 --> 23:37.748
It's a she?

23:42.254 --> 23:43.671
Excuse me Monsieur

23:43.839 --> 23:46.090
Are you the famous artist,
Maurice Utrillo?

23:46.258 --> 23:48.717
Yes indeed I am. Who might you be?

23:48.885 --> 23:50.803
I'm a strangled chicken

23:50.971 --> 23:52.680
Why don't you take me home
and eat me?

23:52.848 --> 23:54.682
Oh you mind if I do, yeah

23:54.850 --> 23:56.809
I've found her!

23:56.977 --> 24:02.815
Oh..Isn't she glorious?

24:03.024 --> 24:04.942
Oh, she's going to
win me the competition

24:05.110 --> 24:07.153
Competition? You didn't say nothing
about the competition

24:07.362 --> 24:08.279
Well you never asked!

24:08.447 --> 24:09.071
Come on help me!

24:09.239 --> 24:10.156
It's your beef!

24:10.365 --> 24:11.907
Come on! Come on

24:12.075 --> 24:14.160
Get it out of my face!

24:17.873 --> 24:18.998
Ah shit!

24:19.166 --> 24:20.624
Out! ! Out! Go, go, go, go, go.
Let's go!

24:22.210 --> 24:24.962
You come back! Come back!

24:25.130 --> 24:27.298
I'll come back for you my love!

24:43.106 --> 24:44.857
He says words of love to me.
Words of every day

24:45.650 --> 24:47.693
Good evening ladies

24:57.120 --> 24:58.954
And that does something to me

25:01.249 --> 25:02.082
I love you

25:02.250 --> 25:03.042
And I love you

25:03.251 --> 25:06.629
I love you

25:08.298 --> 25:09.507
I missed you

25:09.674 --> 25:10.382
Good

25:10.592 --> 25:12.426
I am coming

25:14.679 --> 25:17.223
Where have you been?

25:17.432 --> 25:19.058
Waiting for you

25:39.871 --> 25:40.955
Like that?

25:41.122 --> 25:42.957
That's beautiful

25:47.295 --> 25:57.805
And speaks quite low
Life is rose coloured

25:57.973 --> 26:09.900
He says to me words of love
words of every day

26:10.110 --> 26:17.449
that does something to me

26:17.617 --> 26:28.085
He has entered my heart
a part of happiness,
that I know the cause of

26:28.253 --> 26:39.597
It's him for me, me for him, for life,
he said it to me, swore it to me for life

26:39.764 --> 26:52.610
and once I see him,
then I feel..inside me, my heart beating

27:22.057 --> 27:27.936
Where are you going?

27:28.813 --> 27:34.401
What's wrong?

27:37.238 --> 27:39.198
Have you looked around?

27:40.909 --> 27:42.534
You think it's right
to leave our baby?

27:42.744 --> 27:44.953
Come to a place like this?

27:47.457 --> 27:49.416
Look at me?

27:49.584 --> 27:51.960
I have nothing for you

27:52.712 --> 27:55.130
I have nothing

27:56.424 --> 27:58.133
I am nothing

28:02.597 --> 28:05.099
Can't even be a father to my own child

28:07.435 --> 28:09.311
I can't

28:11.898 --> 28:14.233
So that's it

28:14.401 --> 28:16.026
You just run away?

28:16.194 --> 28:18.320
Isn't that what I do best?

28:23.243 --> 28:24.702
Run away

28:26.788 --> 28:27.871
I'm sorry

28:28.039 --> 28:29.456
No you're not

28:29.624 --> 28:32.000
You're too damn selfish to be sorry

28:32.168 --> 28:34.420
I walked away from
my baby to be with you

28:34.629 --> 28:36.255
You should go back

28:36.464 --> 28:39.049
Go back and be the girl
you once were when I first met you

28:39.217 --> 28:41.385
Do you remember her?

28:41.553 --> 28:43.721
Can you remember?

28:43.888 --> 28:46.140
Would she put up with this?

28:48.727 --> 28:49.560
No

28:49.728 --> 28:52.229
Would she put up with me?

28:52.439 --> 28:54.106
No

29:00.864 --> 29:02.906
Now, this one mmm, mmm?

29:03.074 --> 29:03.824
Why not?

29:03.992 --> 29:06.034
Madam, I do not know which
painting you wish to see today

29:06.202 --> 29:07.995
perhaps if you could
point or choose one...

29:08.163 --> 29:10.372
But... ah, yes. Yeah

29:12.667 --> 29:14.126
The Matisse, ha?

29:14.294 --> 29:17.296
What big eyes you
have today grandma?

29:18.047 --> 29:19.715
Bye bye

29:19.883 --> 29:21.133
There

29:23.845 --> 29:25.596
Jeanne. Hello

29:25.764 --> 29:29.183
How are you?
I am fine...err... is Modi ok?

29:29.350 --> 29:30.517
I haven't seen him

29:30.685 --> 29:32.436
I don't know where he is

29:37.859 --> 29:39.026
So what is the problem?

29:39.194 --> 29:39.902
I need your help

29:40.069 --> 29:41.737
Well anything

29:41.905 --> 29:44.198
I want you to go to Picasso

29:44.365 --> 29:46.992
Ask him to hang
Modi's work beside his...

29:47.160 --> 29:50.120
in the new exhibition

29:51.873 --> 29:54.833
Yes... erm anything...err...but that

29:55.043 --> 29:56.668
Zbo

29:56.836 --> 29:58.337
Impossible

29:58.546 --> 30:00.839
Modi, Picasso he...

30:01.007 --> 30:04.301
Besides Modi would kill me,
if I were to do such a thing

30:05.845 --> 30:07.846
l... I'm sorry Jeanne I cannot

30:08.056 --> 30:10.349
Zbo, if Modi's work
could hang beside Pablo's

30:10.558 --> 30:13.352
there's a chance he could sell

30:13.561 --> 30:14.937
We need money, Zbo

30:15.104 --> 30:15.687
Yes. Erm...

30:15.855 --> 30:18.398
Please. Please

30:18.942 --> 30:20.901
Look I love you both

30:21.069 --> 30:22.861
But you are best off with your family

30:23.071 --> 30:28.033
At least the child...
would have a better chance in life

30:31.246 --> 30:32.120
I'm wasting my breath?

30:32.288 --> 30:34.540
Yes.
Yes

30:34.707 --> 30:37.292
I am always wasting my breath

30:37.460 --> 30:40.212
Okay, let us think

30:46.928 --> 30:50.222
Ooh! Ah! I know

30:53.017 --> 30:59.106
Perhaps there is something
you Jeanne... could do

30:59.274 --> 31:01.358
It would be bold

31:01.526 --> 31:04.236
It's his way of saying sorry.
For the other night

31:04.404 --> 31:05.988
For the other night, huh?

31:06.155 --> 31:08.824
And what about the nights before that?

31:08.992 --> 31:10.158
Let me see

31:10.326 --> 31:13.078
One canvas per insult

31:13.246 --> 31:14.121
Olga?

31:14.289 --> 31:15.205
How many?

31:15.373 --> 31:18.000
Hundreds Pablo

31:24.549 --> 31:25.716
Let me paint you, Jeanne

31:25.884 --> 31:28.343
I will make you... immortal

31:28.511 --> 31:32.681
That'sjust too much
responsibility on these shoulders

31:41.024 --> 31:43.191
My answer is no

31:50.116 --> 31:51.742
Wait

32:02.337 --> 32:04.212
I look handsome, huh?

32:04.380 --> 32:07.132
Like Modigliani

32:07.342 --> 32:09.968
There'sjust no comparison

32:12.096 --> 32:14.264
He can hang one painting

32:14.432 --> 32:17.059
But there is one condition

32:31.699 --> 32:33.784
You can go now

32:38.206 --> 32:42.376
You are up to something

32:42.543 --> 32:43.794
What?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.712
Keep dusting

32:47.632 --> 32:48.548
Modi!

32:48.716 --> 32:51.468
Modi! Modigliani

32:51.636 --> 32:53.345
Why is he not answering?

32:53.513 --> 32:56.682
Modi, ah finally

32:58.434 --> 32:58.976
Oh shit!

32:59.143 --> 33:01.603
You woke my son,
you dumb bastard

33:01.771 --> 33:02.938
Kill him

33:03.106 --> 33:04.189
Quick!

33:05.441 --> 33:06.775
Modi, how could you?
I'm your agent

33:06.943 --> 33:08.860
You haven't sold a painting
in six months

33:09.028 --> 33:10.195
Kill him

33:12.031 --> 33:12.781
If he shoots me

33:12.949 --> 33:16.118
you can kiss your show goodbye,
because I will not be alive to organise

33:16.285 --> 33:17.285
bastard!

33:18.746 --> 33:20.122
Phillipe

33:20.289 --> 33:20.831
Stop

33:20.999 --> 33:21.999
You said I could kill him

33:22.166 --> 33:24.001
Later, kill him later

33:24.168 --> 33:26.670
And you, bastard! Stop! Stop!

33:26.879 --> 33:28.630
Come out you coward

33:28.798 --> 33:30.757
You'd better have some wine

33:45.106 --> 33:46.940
No, no, no, no, beautiful, yes you are lovely

33:47.108 --> 33:49.693
please have this, I will have that,
thank you. Goodbye

33:49.861 --> 33:52.821
Now ... Modi, please have you
given thought to the competition?

33:52.989 --> 33:54.531
Five thousand francs is a lot of money

33:54.699 --> 33:56.366
It's true... so

33:56.534 --> 33:58.410
Okay, okay

33:59.287 --> 34:00.787
Modi, you know
that the whole of Paris

34:01.122 --> 34:03.623
is dreaming of the day,
you and Picasso compete together

34:03.875 --> 34:06.585
Yes, yes, me and Picasso

34:08.170 --> 34:10.422
You said something about a show?

34:10.590 --> 34:13.050
Yes well it is not so much
of a show more of a...

34:13.259 --> 34:13.800
favour

34:13.967 --> 34:17.929
Pablo has offered to hang one of
your paintings in his exhibition

34:18.723 --> 34:21.016
A favour?

34:21.184 --> 34:24.518
Pablo Picasso is going
to do Modigliani a favour

34:24.687 --> 34:26.438
What's the matter with you?

34:26.606 --> 34:29.190
No no, Modi, you have to care now

34:29.358 --> 34:31.650
Please your family, for Jeanne

34:31.819 --> 34:34.029
You wanna do me a favour?

34:35.822 --> 34:36.947
I need money for a doctor

34:37.158 --> 34:38.449
No, no, no, Modi

34:38.659 --> 34:40.159
Hey, I need money for a doctor

34:40.328 --> 34:40.911
Please...

34:41.120 --> 34:43.580
Promise me, you will not drink it all away

34:43.790 --> 34:46.958
Okay, yes take your picture

34:53.091 --> 34:55.342
What if the doctor drinks?

35:05.186 --> 35:06.978
Am I dying?

35:07.647 --> 35:09.981
You said you had tuberculosis
as a child?

35:10.149 --> 35:14.277
Yes. But I feel much better now

35:15.530 --> 35:18.281
It never left you

35:18.825 --> 35:21.284
You can dress now

35:21.452 --> 35:25.247
Your lungs are working
at less then half their capacity

35:25.957 --> 35:29.709
If you continue to use drugs and alcohol...

35:29.877 --> 35:32.254
You will not live past this year

35:33.297 --> 35:35.882
This medicine will help your cough

36:54.795 --> 36:56.046
Oh, maybe you shouldn't do that

36:56.214 --> 36:57.380
Fuck him

36:59.008 --> 37:01.343
Draw some horns, horns...

37:03.221 --> 37:04.679
Ah perfect!

37:07.683 --> 37:08.934
Why are you so nervous?

37:09.143 --> 37:13.605
Er... no, no, no, I'm not...
er... what did the doctor say?

37:14.148 --> 37:15.565
He said I should find a new agent

37:15.733 --> 37:16.775
Good

37:16.984 --> 37:18.610
Let's get out of here

37:18.819 --> 37:20.904
I'm fed up with this circus

37:22.031 --> 37:24.074
There he is

37:25.618 --> 37:27.077
Good evening gentlemen

37:27.286 --> 37:30.580
Well Modi.
What have you to say for yourself?

37:30.748 --> 37:31.539
Hello Gertrude

37:31.707 --> 37:34.334
Don't Gertrude me

37:34.502 --> 37:38.672
Four days I waited. Four days

37:38.839 --> 37:40.340
Am I not good enough to paint?

37:40.508 --> 37:43.093
Not pretty enough perhaps, huh?
Is that it?

37:43.261 --> 37:46.763
It is I who is not good enough
to paint something so exquisite

37:47.890 --> 37:51.351
Balderdash and horse shit

37:51.519 --> 37:54.521
Tomorrow morning,
my apartment, ten o'clock sharp

37:54.689 --> 37:56.064
Sharp do you hear me

37:56.232 --> 37:59.359
Madame Stein, do not worry.
I promise you, he will be there

37:59.527 --> 38:00.235
You will be there

38:00.403 --> 38:01.820
Ladies and gentlemen

38:01.988 --> 38:04.864
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention please

38:05.032 --> 38:11.496
Welcome to this...the tenth exhibition
of work... by the artist Picasso

38:11.706 --> 38:13.790
And Modigliani. Arsehole!

38:13.958 --> 38:17.252
With additional works by Modigliani

38:25.219 --> 38:28.930
Ladies and gentlemen. I give you...

38:29.098 --> 38:30.640
Picasso

38:30.808 --> 38:34.519
A work.... in progress

38:37.565 --> 38:39.065
Oh!

38:39.233 --> 38:41.276
Oh... oh no

39:12.767 --> 39:14.017
There you are

39:57.478 --> 39:58.061
Oh!

39:58.229 --> 39:59.854
Yeah!

40:01.565 --> 40:02.899
There you are

40:03.067 --> 40:05.860
Modigliani is magnificent

40:12.660 --> 40:14.369
Oh he is a true artist

40:14.537 --> 40:17.288
True artist Modigliani

40:18.249 --> 40:19.749
Modi wait!

40:19.959 --> 40:21.376
Wait!

40:24.171 --> 40:25.630
I did it for you

40:25.798 --> 40:26.923
To help you

40:27.091 --> 40:28.591
I don't need that fucked kind of help

40:28.759 --> 40:29.676
Fine!

40:29.844 --> 40:31.678
What about your baby?

40:31.846 --> 40:32.720
Fuck!

40:32.888 --> 40:34.681
What about your baby?

40:34.849 --> 40:36.641
Do you know what she needs?

40:36.851 --> 40:38.143
She needs you

40:38.310 --> 40:40.979
Yes she needs you!

40:45.276 --> 40:46.776
Beautiful

40:47.945 --> 40:49.696
Yeah, it's Papa

40:49.864 --> 40:50.864
He should go

40:51.031 --> 40:51.906
Mamma please

40:52.074 --> 40:53.783
Your father will be home soon

40:53.951 --> 40:55.160
He can't be here

40:55.369 --> 40:56.494
I'm going with him

40:56.704 --> 40:58.163
And then what?

40:59.832 --> 41:02.292
Let him abuse you again?

41:02.460 --> 41:03.001
Destroy you

41:03.210 --> 41:04.669
Stop it! I don't want to hear!

41:04.837 --> 41:07.964
I don't want to hear that.
I don't want to hear that

41:11.177 --> 41:12.927
Ok Modi let's go

41:22.229 --> 41:23.354
Oh, don't Jeanne

41:23.564 --> 41:25.565
I warn you

41:25.733 --> 41:29.360
If you choose to be with that Jew

41:29.570 --> 41:31.529
I will have no alternative...

41:31.739 --> 41:33.865
But to inform the necessary authorities

41:34.033 --> 41:35.950
that you are an unfit mother...

41:36.118 --> 41:40.580
After which...they will take your child...

41:40.748 --> 41:43.208
And you will never see her again

41:55.179 --> 41:57.388
See how beautiful she is

41:59.350 --> 42:02.352
Look at her

42:27.461 --> 42:29.462
Grand papa

42:45.020 --> 42:47.397
I'll be watching you

43:44.371 --> 43:46.497
Here I am Madame Stein

43:46.915 --> 43:48.499
So...

43:49.209 --> 43:50.209
What?

43:50.377 --> 43:52.337
Oh Jeanne, you dummy

43:52.504 --> 43:56.090
That was a clever stroke she played
on the Little Minotaur last night

43:56.258 --> 43:58.176
Bright girl that one

43:58.344 --> 44:01.804
So... did you kiss and make up

44:07.227 --> 44:09.270
She's better off without me

44:10.856 --> 44:13.358
My abundant ass!

44:18.614 --> 44:20.698
Do you want some advice?

44:20.908 --> 44:21.949
Do I have a choice?

44:22.117 --> 44:24.077
Hell, no

44:24.244 --> 44:26.579
Enter the competition

44:26.747 --> 44:30.208
I bet the minute you do, Pablo will too

44:31.168 --> 44:32.627
Hmm

44:34.254 --> 44:36.631
Never he is too proud

44:36.799 --> 44:38.508
Plus he doesn't need the money

44:38.676 --> 44:40.510
Hmm?

44:41.970 --> 44:45.264
Maybe. But you do

44:48.811 --> 44:50.353
Right

44:58.404 --> 44:59.570
With or without?

44:59.780 --> 45:00.822
What?

45:00.989 --> 45:03.700
The cream on the mouth

45:13.335 --> 45:14.752
Give me one good reason why?

45:14.962 --> 45:18.089
Rivera. Kisling. Utrillo

45:18.257 --> 45:19.924
Soutine

45:21.927 --> 45:23.386
Modigliani?

45:23.554 --> 45:25.221
Oh did Ijust say the wrong name?

45:25.389 --> 45:26.139
Monsieur Cocteau?

45:26.306 --> 45:26.973
Olga

45:27.141 --> 45:29.642
Tell him he must
compete in the competition

45:29.810 --> 45:32.937
You must compete in the competition

45:35.149 --> 45:36.607
I'm making dinner. How's swordfish?

45:36.775 --> 45:38.609
To the point

45:39.445 --> 45:40.611
So?

45:40.779 --> 45:42.989
Who... who told you he's in?

45:43.157 --> 45:46.033
Gertrude. She had him sketch her

45:46.201 --> 45:50.037
She said he needs the money badly.
And that he has no choice

45:50.205 --> 45:52.665
Don't believe her. She lies for a living

45:52.833 --> 45:55.585
Come on please, Pablo

45:56.587 --> 45:58.254
It would be so much fun

45:58.422 --> 46:01.048
Paris has become so tedious
since the war

46:01.216 --> 46:02.633
We must bring back the life!

46:02.843 --> 46:05.011
Fireworks. Champagne

46:05.179 --> 46:07.805
All night drinking and laughing

46:08.015 --> 46:09.348
Get into the ring

46:09.516 --> 46:11.684
Play with the bull

46:14.188 --> 46:15.980
I am the bull

46:20.319 --> 46:22.153
Mmm! Fish

46:23.197 --> 46:24.989
Let's eat

46:28.869 --> 46:30.620
I love it

46:39.630 --> 46:41.756
The parade!

46:44.384 --> 46:47.678
Daddy they're coming!

46:50.224 --> 46:51.724
Search the house

47:05.489 --> 47:08.074
Modigliani! It's me, Pablo

47:08.242 --> 47:10.284
How are you, Amadeo Modigliani?

47:10.452 --> 47:11.494
Hello Modi

47:11.703 --> 47:12.829
Or do we call you Dedo?

47:12.996 --> 47:15.498
What do we call you?

47:15.666 --> 47:17.667
It's a great day today

47:17.876 --> 47:19.502
Hey!

47:19.670 --> 47:22.547
Bonjour Matador

47:22.756 --> 47:27.343
Now... let me ask you a question?

47:27.511 --> 47:29.846
You will enter the competition?

47:32.224 --> 47:34.183
Answer me!

48:29.656 --> 48:34.201
Don't touch my work

48:34.369 --> 48:36.662
You do not have the right
to touch my work

48:36.830 --> 48:39.874
Get your hands off my work

48:47.716 --> 48:49.467
Huh? What?

48:58.602 --> 49:00.478
You have money?

49:02.481 --> 49:05.107
I can make you very happy

49:05.275 --> 49:07.985
if you have money

49:08.153 --> 49:09.987
I have nothing

49:41.895 --> 49:45.064
Modi, Modi!
Are you ok?

49:46.608 --> 49:47.650
Who paid the fine?

49:47.859 --> 49:49.193
I don't know

49:49.361 --> 49:50.069
Who paid the fine?

49:50.237 --> 49:52.446
I don't know. Whoever it was,
they chose not to be revealed

49:52.614 --> 49:54.156
Well find out. I won't be
indebted to anyone

49:54.366 --> 49:55.825
Trust me. If I find out who it was

49:56.034 --> 49:58.119
I will first try to sell them your paintings

49:58.286 --> 50:00.204
Then I will thank him

50:06.920 --> 50:08.504
What?

50:08.672 --> 50:10.089
What is it?

50:10.257 --> 50:11.716
It's Utrillo

50:13.385 --> 50:14.385
What?

50:14.594 --> 50:16.053
He's back in the asylum

50:16.263 --> 50:17.722
His mother, she told the police he was mad

50:17.931 --> 50:18.639
that they must put him away...

50:18.807 --> 50:20.933
Modi, Modi,
listen this is a sign from God

50:21.101 --> 50:22.560
He's telling you things must change

50:22.728 --> 50:26.147
Where was God
when Utrillo needed him?

50:37.492 --> 50:39.577
If you've come to gloat,
you're too late

50:39.786 --> 50:42.079
You should have seen it this morning

50:42.289 --> 50:46.333
Your father visited
the Child Welfare this morning

50:46.501 --> 50:50.087
He's recommended
they take custody of the baby

50:53.425 --> 50:55.468
Did you hear me?

50:57.012 --> 50:58.929
You're going to lose your child!

50:59.139 --> 51:00.222
I have no choice

51:00.390 --> 51:00.973
Your child!

51:01.141 --> 51:02.933
I have no choice!

51:03.143 --> 51:05.102
I've no choice!

51:05.979 --> 51:08.355
You could choose your baby

51:08.523 --> 51:10.816
I'll die without him

51:12.819 --> 51:14.820
You'll die with him

52:08.583 --> 52:10.042
Maurice

52:10.877 --> 52:13.754
Maurice, it's me, Modi

52:14.256 --> 52:14.672
Modi?

52:14.881 --> 52:15.631
Modi

52:15.799 --> 52:17.842
It's me, Maurice

52:18.051 --> 52:19.510
Modi

52:26.309 --> 52:29.019
Modi, where the fuck have you been?

52:29.187 --> 52:31.021
You missed all the fun

52:31.189 --> 52:41.323
Shh...shh...shh...shh
it's ok... ok... ok... ok... Ok

52:48.206 --> 52:51.333
Utrillo, everything's going to be fine, hey.
I'll get you out of here

52:52.878 --> 52:55.004
Eternal dreamer, hey

52:55.172 --> 52:57.214
You should know by now this is my life

52:57.424 --> 52:58.549
This is my place

52:58.758 --> 53:02.386
You shouldn't feel sorry for me,
you should be happy

53:02.554 --> 53:04.263
Mad bastard

53:10.437 --> 53:12.062
A little hashish?

53:12.272 --> 53:13.689
Yeah

53:35.879 --> 53:37.755
Modi?

53:37.923 --> 53:38.881
Promise me

53:39.090 --> 53:39.924
Promise you what?

53:40.133 --> 53:42.885
Promise me, you won't
let me die in here, huh?

53:43.470 --> 53:47.848
I've seen what they're doing
to the bodies round here

53:48.642 --> 53:50.935
It's not nice, no

53:51.102 --> 53:52.937
Promise me

53:53.104 --> 53:54.313
I don't know...

53:54.481 --> 53:57.066
Modi ... Modi .

53:59.819 --> 54:01.612
I promise. I promise

54:01.780 --> 54:02.696
I'm so cold

54:02.864 --> 54:04.657
It's ok. I got you

54:04.824 --> 54:06.867
I wish I could hug you

54:07.035 --> 54:09.787
Oh Modi

54:11.414 --> 54:14.291
I'm cold. I'm so cold

54:45.865 --> 54:47.950
Ah! Soutine

54:48.118 --> 54:51.120
Oh Max you're a big

54:51.288 --> 54:53.163
Modi. Jeanne

54:53.331 --> 54:57.459
Welcome. I'm overwhelmed.
I'm overwhelmed

54:57.627 --> 55:00.379
Jeanne
You look great

55:00.547 --> 55:02.006
You look gorgeous Max look at you

55:02.173 --> 55:03.007
Magnificent

55:03.174 --> 55:07.261
Oh! I love your shoes

55:07.429 --> 55:09.596
Enjoy the party.
Thank you

55:11.725 --> 55:13.517
You should thank Picasso

55:13.685 --> 55:15.227
For what?

55:16.771 --> 55:18.689
For balling you out

55:18.857 --> 55:21.525
Oh! There's Kisling

55:21.693 --> 55:22.693
Max!

55:22.902 --> 55:25.070
Modi!

55:25.238 --> 55:28.699
Now... now... now... I've been reborn
when I see this vision before me. Jeanne

55:28.867 --> 55:30.284
Jeanne. Dance?

55:30.452 --> 55:32.494
Yes, of course.
Dance!

55:32.662 --> 55:33.954
Modi!

55:34.998 --> 55:37.166
Thank you
Pablo is over here

55:39.669 --> 55:41.211
Pablo!

55:48.887 --> 55:50.721
The famous Picasso

55:50.930 --> 55:52.514
Matador

55:58.938 --> 56:00.564
I didn't ask you to ball me out

56:00.732 --> 56:02.775
Oh, you want to pay me back?

56:02.942 --> 56:04.735
Let's see

56:05.862 --> 56:07.738
Why don't you come tomorrow?

56:07.947 --> 56:11.158
We'll go for a trip to the...the countryside

56:11.326 --> 56:13.243
There's somebody
I want you to meet

56:13.411 --> 56:16.121
Only if Olga comes

56:16.289 --> 56:19.833
You really like my wife, huh?

56:20.001 --> 56:23.045
Everybody really likes your wife

56:25.173 --> 56:27.049
Pablo

56:29.803 --> 56:32.096
Tonight is a night for dancing. Ok?

56:32.263 --> 56:34.932
When a samurai takes out his sword

56:35.141 --> 56:37.643
He must draw blood

56:50.865 --> 56:59.832
For she's a jolly good fellow

56:59.999 --> 57:16.181
And so say all of us

57:16.349 --> 57:26.024
For she's a jolly good fellow

57:26.025 --> 57:28.861
And so say all of us

57:55.013 --> 57:56.722
Who lives here?

57:59.392 --> 58:00.851
You'll see

58:35.303 --> 58:36.845
Renoir

58:37.013 --> 58:39.139
Come meet God

59:00.787 --> 59:02.371
Maestro

59:15.343 --> 59:18.011
This one looks mad

59:21.849 --> 59:24.101
Are you mad?

59:30.316 --> 59:32.609
They scare you?

59:32.819 --> 59:34.945
Deformed instruments

59:35.154 --> 59:40.033
The genius sucked out
through the fingernails!

59:41.202 --> 59:43.620
They don't bother me

59:43.830 --> 59:45.372
Liar

59:46.291 --> 59:49.710
He's a liar Pablo

59:52.880 --> 59:54.756
May I ask you?

59:54.924 --> 59:56.925
How much does a place
like this cost?

59:57.093 --> 59:58.677
Two paintings

59:58.678 --> 01:00:00.470
Small

01:00:00.638 --> 01:00:03.599
I have... two cars in the stables

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:05.809
A sketch for each

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:09.646
And....this Rodin

01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:14.943
I gave one little pencil
drawing of a flower pot

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:17.237
No flower

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:19.990
Just a pot

01:00:22.368 --> 01:00:24.911
You will sell?

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:29.541
Modigliani is on the verge

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.252
On the verge.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.212
Yes I know....

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.798
The precipice

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:38.592
The cliff

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:45.390
Where all artists converge
and jump to their fate

01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:56.276
Nudes, mostly

01:00:56.444 --> 01:01:00.197
Occasionally portrait to eat or drink?

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:01.198
Yes?

01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:05.452
Yes.
How did you know?

01:01:06.704 --> 01:01:09.831
Pablo told me

01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:15.629
I never liked painting nudes myself

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:19.841
Most of the women in my time,
were too fat

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:21.593
And ugly...

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:25.305
Ugly

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:28.392
I like them... tall...

01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:30.310
And slim

01:01:30.895 --> 01:01:33.647
So... it's late

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:35.607
We should go

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.782
Modigliani

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.534
Yes

01:01:46.327 --> 01:01:49.079
Amedeo Modigliani

01:01:49.288 --> 01:01:51.832
Yes

01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:55.836
Are you mad?

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:10.892
I knew that

01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:21.153
You will enter the competition?

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:25.115
Will you?

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.745
Did you see what painting
can bring? Huh?

01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:33.331
Comfort, wealth...security

01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:36.042
Only fools struggle and starve

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:38.628
Paris is crawling with them

01:02:38.796 --> 01:02:40.046
So paint, huh?

01:02:40.214 --> 01:02:42.340
Make money! Live old!

01:02:42.508 --> 01:02:44.384
Fuck as many women as you can

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:48.847
But drink ...... in moderation

01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:54.853
The Gospel according to Picasso

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.655
Ah! You can't fight me now, huh?

01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:07.991
So let me ask you?

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:10.619
Are you mocking me?

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:15.999
I try

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.627
Sometimes I don't succeed

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.378
Sometimes

01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:26.092
You see Modi. There is a difference
between you and... me

01:03:27.512 --> 01:03:28.303
Success

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.472
Ah yes

01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:49.324
I am Picasso. The famous Picasso

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.701
This is my car. I am the driver

01:03:51.869 --> 01:03:53.745
These are my trees

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:56.081
I bought them from God

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:58.250
You like my hat?

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:01.044
I am Modigliani

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:04.256
A crazy Italian fuck!

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.718
Modigliani ... Your son Picasso!

01:04:08.886 --> 01:04:11.513
You're scaring the peasants

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.116
Her neck is not so long

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:34.703
She has her father's neck, short

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.079
Ok, excuseer...

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:38.081
Her neck...
Her neck is...is... er...not so long...

01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:41.751
Excuse me... yes ok,
err... yes I know. But ok

01:04:43.462 --> 01:04:46.631
Go back,
yes. Get out of my way thank you

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:57.559
Ah! Psss....pss. Don't touch my painting

01:04:57.768 --> 01:04:59.603
You ruined it because
you're not very good

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.438
I'm the painter,
you ruined the painting

01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:05.567
You were playing with your wine, and
of course your paintings are falling on you

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:12.866
You paint it

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:20.874
You like it?
It's for you

01:05:24.503 --> 01:05:26.087
Beautiful

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:26.838
Fuck off

01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:30.216
I'm not paying for this

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:05.877
Heres to Livorno

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:47.460
Modi!

01:06:47.628 --> 01:06:49.045
You promised me

01:06:49.213 --> 01:06:52.549
promised you wouldn't
let me die in here

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:58.031
No! no!

01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:00.366
No Jeanne!

01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:05.789
Please, no! No! No!

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:38.446
Modi ...
Modi ... come on

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:43.952
Maurice

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:45.828
You're safe

01:08:45.996 --> 01:08:47.997
Yeah, I'm safe

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:53.294
Get away from him.
All of you. Get out!

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:57.381
Get out! Get out!

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:58.550
Look what he's become

01:08:58.716 --> 01:09:00.551
What you've all become

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:02.345
You think this is romantic?

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:03.888
This is how it should be?

01:09:04.055 --> 01:09:05.598
Get out!

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:16.192
Take some water

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.541
Are you ok?

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:39.631
Dedo says I shouldn't leave you

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.218
That's what he said

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:44.679
So I won't

01:09:44.846 --> 01:09:47.223
Never again

01:09:51.228 --> 01:09:57.317
Mmmm! The rain it speaks

01:09:57.484 --> 01:10:01.779
Really?
And what does it say?

01:10:08.412 --> 01:10:11.456
It says don't cry my love

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.501
Dedo's here

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:41.319
How do you feel?

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.781
Alive

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:49.035
You should thank Zbo

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:50.954
He gave us the money
to come here

01:10:51.121 --> 01:10:53.122
Zbo

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:54.540
If he could only sell my work

01:10:54.708 --> 01:10:56.918
we can come here more often

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.463
Well I am trying

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:03.591
Jeanne, that was the most
beautiful meal thank you

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.760
I'm quite stuffed

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:09.305
So tell us what else has
been happening in Paris?

01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:11.808
Well... there is nothing new
I mean... it the same as before...

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:16.729
Just watching everyone
get ready for the competition

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.402
Well Modi...
mmm?

01:11:22.569 --> 01:11:24.237
No

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:30.660
I'm going to rest, I'm tired

01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:35.164
Remember, no drink

01:11:35.332 --> 01:11:36.833
No drink

01:11:44.758 --> 01:11:46.634
I love you.
Love you

01:11:48.512 --> 01:11:49.762
Goodnight.
Goodnight

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:51.097
Goodnight

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:52.807
See you later

01:11:54.184 --> 01:11:55.935
May I see the work?

01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:58.479
See the work? What for?

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.565
You're not going to sell anything

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:05.486
These are beautiful.
They are so ... poetry

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:11.659
Modi...It'sjust as well, because you are
going to need all of these in Paris

01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:14.370
For your... one man show

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:17.415
Yes.
Yes

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.500
You heard me right

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:22.628
Berthe Weill loved the nudes

01:12:22.796 --> 01:12:27.050
So much she wants to hang...
everything you have

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:33.848
Modi did you hear me?

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:41.522
Berthe Weill...Is giving you...
your very own ... one man show!

01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:04.128
I'm going to be hot! I'm going to be hot!

01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:27.902
Bravo Modigliani! Bravo!

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.862
They are exquisite

01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:31.322
You agree, Cocteau?

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:32.865
Always Pablo

01:13:33.033 --> 01:13:34.992
Ah, Jeanne. Radiant Jeanne

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:35.993
Berthe Weill?

01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:36.869
Yes

01:13:37.037 --> 01:13:38.246
You are the gallery owner?

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:41.165
You know I am Pierre,
you livejust across the street

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:43.960
You will remove the nude painting
from your gallery window

01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:46.796
Oh no! I will do no such thing

01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:54.971
Oh no. Pierre come back
with the paper tomorrow

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:58.474
If you don't remove the paintings,
my men will do it for you

01:13:58.642 --> 01:13:59.976
Then we will close down the show

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:00.601
No

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:02.186
This is outrageous!

01:14:02.354 --> 01:14:05.314
What's wrong Sergeant?
Are the pictures of your mother?

01:14:05.482 --> 01:14:08.276
You sister... huh?

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:15.283
Do as he says.
No

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.954
it is tragic

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:23.082
Why Modi?

01:14:29.047 --> 01:14:30.882
I'm impressed

01:14:34.219 --> 01:14:36.179
Oh er... by the way

01:14:36.346 --> 01:14:37.847
I hope you won't be offended Modi...

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:40.349
That painting that
you gave me as a gift...

01:14:40.517 --> 01:14:42.852
The one that Jeanne brought for me

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:47.064
The other night I was...
inspired by something

01:14:47.232 --> 01:14:50.902
A felt hat ... yes a felt hat

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:54.071
Anyway... I didn't have a canvas...

01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:56.657
Where at four in the morning,
does one find a canvas?

01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:59.202
Make your point Spaniard

01:15:00.704 --> 01:15:03.498
I used your painting

01:15:12.257 --> 01:15:14.425
Do you forgive me?

01:15:29.983 --> 01:15:31.734
We're going

01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:42.703
I think I like the new Modigliani

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:45.748
Yes I think I do

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.709
Let's look around

01:16:01.473 --> 01:16:03.266
I'm tired

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:07.645
I'm not

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:11.023
Well that's because
you're not pregnant

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:18.322
So...

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:20.032
Go go...

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.702
Can you stop the bus please?
See you later... bye!

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:28.624
Tell me Modigliani, Modigliani!

01:16:28.792 --> 01:16:31.794
How does a blind man paint?

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.131
Huh! You don't know?

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:45.600
He paints nudes nobody sees

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:48.436
Nudes that nobody sees

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:56.611
Go!

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:16.339
What?

01:17:16.506 --> 01:17:18.758
He gave the baby to the Welfare

01:17:18.925 --> 01:17:20.217
What?
Your baby

01:17:20.385 --> 01:17:24.096
Your beautiful little girl
is now in strange hands

01:17:24.264 --> 01:17:26.098
And all because you won't
come to your senses

01:17:26.266 --> 01:17:28.976
and live a normal life!
Like the rest of the world around you

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:33.230
Achilles! Achilles!

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:37.735
Achilles Hebuterne! Show your face!

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:39.987
Show your face

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:42.031
Achilles!

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:44.867
You see me? You see the Jew!

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:47.244
Go away or I will call the police

01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:49.497
You better call the police

01:18:07.724 --> 01:18:09.517
Where's my baby?

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:11.560
You get away from me

01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:15.731
Where's my baby?

01:18:15.899 --> 01:18:18.484
Somewhere where you'll never find her

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:27.410
Huh? Go on

01:18:27.577 --> 01:18:28.953
Do it

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:31.539
Do it! Do it!

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:35.126
There'sjust you and me no one is here

01:18:35.293 --> 01:18:38.754
Tomorrow you can tell the whole world that...

01:18:38.922 --> 01:18:41.924
A Jew... threatened your life

01:18:42.092 --> 01:18:43.676
A Jew

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:52.101
Do it! Do it!

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.438
I'm... I'm going to ask you one more time

01:18:55.605 --> 01:18:56.897
Where's my baby?

01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:04.196
You have neither the resource
nor the conviction to raise her

01:19:22.048 --> 01:19:23.883
Watch me!

01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:01.397
I forgive you

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:27.107

Marriage license.

01:30:58.911 --> 01:31:01.663
Ah! Silence, no?

01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:07.794

01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:01.223
Ah! Me too

01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:01.973
Yeah?
Yes

01:32:02.141 --> 01:32:03.683
Very good

01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:18.657
Mmmm. Excuse me

01:32:20.493 --> 01:32:21.743
You have children?

01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:22.786
No

01:32:22.954 --> 01:32:25.038
Ah! I have one... and one on the way

01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:27.541
Yeah?
Yes

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:29.292
It's important children, huh?

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:31.503
Yeah... very important

01:32:31.671 --> 01:32:32.921
Hmm

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:37.842
Everybody go upstairs

01:32:42.306 --> 01:32:43.890
Go away!

01:32:44.058 --> 01:32:45.767
I'm quite crazy you know?

01:32:45.935 --> 01:32:47.435
I will do something terrible

01:32:47.603 --> 01:32:49.187
Go away!

01:33:03.828 --> 01:33:07.539
Excuse me, clear a path please...
I need to go round the corner

01:33:12.295 --> 01:33:16.423
Cakes, what they Want,
without any problem...

01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:18.800
Yes. Yes

01:33:25.349 --> 01:33:28.059
No, you do not come near this painting,
you do not touch this painting this is m....

01:33:28.227 --> 01:33:31.479
Take your dirty hands off this painting,
it's my painting

01:33:31.647 --> 01:33:33.440
What is Happening?

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:36.610
Monsieur it is a policy of the salon
to hang up the painting

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:38.069
No, no, you so much as
put a finger on this painting

01:33:38.237 --> 01:33:40.989
you will be spending the rest of your life
earning your living as a eunuch

01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:41.364
Monsieur...

01:33:41.532 --> 01:33:44.326
As a eunuch, understood?

01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:47.746
Good, yes, bye
bye, eunuch

01:33:47.913 --> 01:33:50.206
This is my life, not wall paper

01:34:01.218 --> 01:34:02.719
Be careful

01:34:04.013 --> 01:34:05.889
And what about the others?

01:34:06.057 --> 01:34:07.807
All hanging

01:34:07.975 --> 01:34:09.559
All of them?

01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:13.438
All of them

01:34:15.107 --> 01:34:19.736
So...Now we will know

01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:29.537
Monsieur? Monsieur!

01:34:34.126 --> 01:34:34.793
What time is it?

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:36.044
Closing time!

01:34:36.212 --> 01:34:38.088
You must leave now!

01:34:38.714 --> 01:34:40.131

01:35:38.816 --> 01:35:40.567
Ah...Amedeo

01:35:50.786 --> 01:35:52.412
What? What's wrong again?

01:35:52.621 --> 01:35:56.040
Colour. Clash with my painting

01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:17.997
Salut!

01:37:29.844 --> 01:37:31.511
You will pay... for the drinks?

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.263
I have five thousand francs...today

01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:35.390
I buy everybody a drink

01:37:35.558 --> 01:37:37.308
Thank you

01:37:55.244 --> 01:37:56.911
A Livorno!

01:38:29.778 --> 01:38:31.029
Salut!

01:38:49.882 --> 01:38:51.966
Jeanne. Jeanne! Jeanne! Here

01:38:57.389 --> 01:38:58.389
Is he here?

01:38:58.557 --> 01:38:59.515
No I thought he'd be with you

01:38:59.683 --> 01:39:00.183
No

01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:02.101
No! No, no... no

01:39:03.437 --> 01:39:05.813
Jeanne. Jeanne

Mummy

01:39:10.486 --> 01:39:12.820
Thank you so much

01:39:12.988 --> 01:39:16.366
I thought maybe she would bring him luck

01:39:16.533 --> 01:39:17.909
Thank you

01:39:19.954 --> 01:39:22.413
So... where is the great Modigliani?

01:39:22.581 --> 01:39:27.460
Summon... all nomads

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:31.005
All nomads far flung

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:34.509
The trumpets of silence...

01:39:34.677 --> 01:39:37.095
Ships of peace make me sleep

01:39:37.262 --> 01:39:40.181
Cradle me to till the morning comes

01:39:40.349 --> 01:39:44.227
I wrote that myself when I was alone,
in the night

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:46.437
But no longer!

01:39:47.773 --> 01:39:49.899
Today this is proof that I am a rich man

01:39:50.067 --> 01:39:52.318
Rich beyond belief

01:40:24.601 --> 01:40:26.519
Attention Mesdames et Messieurs

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:28.104

Don't worry

01:46:16.495 --> 01:46:18.412
My hands?

01:46:19.039 --> 01:46:19.705
Hand?

01:46:19.915 --> 01:46:21.957
How are my hands?

They'll be ok. They'll be ok

Modi! It's us Utrillo and Soutine

01:47:18.974 --> 01:47:20.766
I can't see nothing

01:47:21.726 --> 01:47:23.644
Modi!

01:47:23.812 --> 01:47:25.187
Get out!

01:47:25.355 --> 01:47:28.774
Modi, in the name of God!

01:47:28.942 --> 01:47:30.151
Get back from him!

01:47:30.318 --> 01:47:31.527
Jeanne!
Get back from him

01:47:31.695 --> 01:47:33.112
We need a doctor

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.655
Jeanne!
Don't take him away!

01:47:34.823 --> 01:47:36.073
Jeanne!

Jeanne! Calm down!
No!

01:47:41.246 --> 01:47:42.496
Utrillo! Quick!

01:47:42.664 --> 01:47:44.874
No!

01:47:45.834 --> 01:47:48.419
Don't take him from me! No!

01:47:48.587 --> 01:47:50.212
Be careful!
Don't move

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:52.381
Jeanne, stay!
No!

01:47:52.549 --> 01:48:04.101
Don't take him from me!

01:48:05.687 --> 01:48:12.651
Please don't... don't take him from me

01:48:23.455 --> 01:48:24.955
Watch his head

01:48:25.665 --> 01:48:27.041
Be careful!

01:48:27.209 --> 01:48:29.502
Modi stay with us

01:48:31.004 --> 01:48:32.880
Oh my God

01:48:34.090 --> 01:48:34.673
Be gentle

01:48:34.883 --> 01:48:37.009
Alright.
Modi?

01:49:15.423 --> 01:49:17.800
Excuse me, Monsieur

01:49:48.957 --> 01:49:51.125
Jeanne?

01:49:53.044 --> 01:49:54.795
My love

01:49:57.299 --> 01:50:01.468
Always ... and forever

01:50:04.639 --> 01:50:09.977
I'm here .. I'm here ...

01:50:16.484 --> 01:50:18.319
Modi

01:50:45.930 --> 01:50:47.723
I'm here

01:50:55.899 --> 01:50:58.359
It's time to end this madness

01:50:58.526 --> 01:51:02.613
No
No

01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:16.335
Modi!

01:51:40.402 --> 01:51:44.279
Wait for me, my love

01:51:44.447 --> 01:51:46.407
Wait for me

01:52:22.026 --> 01:52:25.779
Don't die ...

01:52:32.287 --> 01:52:34.830
.. wake ... wake up

01:53:39.562 --> 01:53:47.402
Jeanne.
I offer you my... deepest sympathies

01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:52.032
I can't imagine...
I cannot imagine how you must feel

01:53:53.243 --> 01:53:59.748
Do you know what I feel? Pablo?

01:53:59.916 --> 01:54:02.125
Shall I tell you?

01:54:05.713 --> 01:54:10.551
I feel... I feel nothing

01:54:12.345 --> 01:54:16.682
I have a baby... in my belly

01:54:18.017 --> 01:54:21.478
Another heart beating

01:54:22.230 --> 01:54:26.817
Another soul... craving

01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:30.904
And I am empty

01:54:31.072 --> 01:54:33.574
Like your glass

01:54:37.704 --> 01:54:40.747
You'll go on Pablo...

01:54:42.667 --> 01:54:44.668
You all will

01:54:44.836 --> 01:54:49.339
Live a full and rich life

01:54:50.258 --> 01:54:53.385
But I swear to God...

01:54:53.595 --> 01:54:57.556
When your time comes...

01:54:57.765 --> 01:55:01.685
When you lay there on your death bed...

01:55:04.772 --> 01:55:08.859
The name... Modigliani....

01:55:09.027 --> 01:55:12.237
Will not be far from your lips

01:55:20.538 --> 01:55:26.960
You can never paint over this night
it belongs to him

01:55:48.733 --> 01:55:52.611
I saw him dance once

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:56.949
By the statue of Balzac....

01:55:57.116 --> 01:56:00.535
So beautiful his face

01:56:00.703 --> 01:56:04.665
So graceful his arms

01:56:04.832 --> 01:56:10.629
As he swayed to the song in his mind

01:56:10.797 --> 01:56:17.636
He was all of the things...
I once was

01:56:17.804 --> 01:56:20.472
So I stole that moment...

01:56:20.682 --> 01:56:26.144
And I locked it away in my mind.
To be there.

01:56:26.312 --> 01:56:28.188
...to comfort me

01:56:28.356 --> 01:56:32.150
..in my ending days

01:56:32.318 --> 01:56:35.445
A gift to Renior

01:56:53.047 --> 01:56:57.092
Papa sends you all the love in the world

01:56:59.721 --> 01:57:02.597
And when you grow up...

01:57:02.765 --> 01:57:07.978
You'll feel our love...Wherever you go

01:57:37.842 --> 01:57:39.885
I wanted you to know

01:57:41.929 --> 01:57:44.264
To understand...

01:57:45.767 --> 01:57:49.269
Try to forgive me

01:57:49.437 --> 01:57:51.396
Please...
