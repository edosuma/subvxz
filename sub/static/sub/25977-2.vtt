00:41.000 --> 00:42.460
Good night.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.295
Good night, Father.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.281
I like the smell
of the ocean here.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.700
All I smell is fish.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.461
Why me?
Why not send one of the others?

06:59.503 --> 07:03.006
I only trust you.

07:03.048 --> 07:08.929
Without you,
I'd be rotting in prison now.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.181
I was pretty good, wasn't I?

07:11.223 --> 07:14.184
You were like a ninja.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.435
It's time.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.247
Take care of yourself.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.550
Ali!

07:46.592 --> 07:49.344
Peace be with you!

07:49.386 --> 07:53.307
Not if she's
been with you first!

18:19.516 --> 18:22.560
Okay, my love Samir, we're done.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.147
If you're going to play in here,

18:26.189 --> 18:28.233
put your toys away
before dinner.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.943
I know.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.069
Is your room clean?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.237
Yes, it's clean.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.280
Are you sure, my love?

18:34.322 --> 18:36.407
Daddy's home!

18:55.176 --> 18:56.511
Daddy!

19:03.101 --> 19:04.936
Welcome back, Dad.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.688
Thank you, God be with you.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.445
Did you bring us any gifts?

19:14.487 --> 19:17.407
I didn't have time.
I was too busy.

19:21.119 --> 19:24.622
But on my way, I did find this.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.915
Do you like it?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.879
Thank you, Daddy!

19:36.593 --> 19:37.969
And these...

19:38.011 --> 19:39.762
are for you.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.431
Thank you, Dad.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.150
Peace be upon you.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.569
Welcome back.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.947
My precious diamond.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.337
Fresh fish.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.297
It's from Alexandria.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.945
I was waiting for you yesterday.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.947
I was delayed.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.207
It's all there.

28:06.477 --> 28:07.603
They told me to tell you...

28:07.645 --> 28:09.188
this is the last of it.

28:09.230 --> 28:10.981
There's no more after this.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.926
Idiot.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.001
What are you doing?

29:12.042 --> 29:16.505
I was searching for my Dad.

29:16.547 --> 29:17.715
Excuse me.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.593
Hey, what's your rush?

29:20.634 --> 29:24.305
I'm Yazid.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.140
Your name is Sara, right?

29:31.437 --> 29:33.063
You want a taste?

29:37.818 --> 29:39.487
I have one for you.

29:53.417 --> 29:54.627
Open it.

30:12.645 --> 30:13.646
Sara!

30:13.687 --> 30:15.523
What's taking so long?

30:36.043 --> 30:37.920
What's wrong, my love?

30:39.672 --> 30:42.758
I hate them!

30:42.800 --> 30:45.344
Why did Daddy bring them here?

30:45.386 --> 30:48.430
Shhh. It's okay, my love.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.394
I won't let anyone hurt you.

31:06.448 --> 31:10.494
The children
are finally sleeping.

31:12.538 --> 31:16.750
You think I didn't
get you a gift?

31:31.932 --> 31:35.185
It looks beautiful on you.

31:45.613 --> 31:48.407
I missed you.

32:03.213 --> 32:05.883
Why are you upset?

32:15.893 --> 32:17.895
Why are they here, Mousa?

32:19.480 --> 32:21.106
My children sleep here.

32:23.901 --> 32:26.070
Who are you bringing
to our home?

32:26.111 --> 32:30.866
They are our children, right?

32:30.908 --> 32:35.621
In all my life,
I've never questioned you...

32:35.663 --> 32:37.790
because you're a good man.

32:37.831 --> 32:42.795
When you fought Assad's army,
I understood

32:42.836 --> 32:49.009
you were fighting for us,
for our country.

32:52.971 --> 32:58.060
But now... things have changed.

32:58.102 --> 33:01.647
What do you mean?

33:01.689 --> 33:05.192
You are different.

33:05.234 --> 33:08.946
These men are using you.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.031
Using me?

33:11.073 --> 33:13.659
They need me.

33:31.301 --> 33:37.474
We need you. Your family. Here.

33:44.106 --> 33:50.863
Everything I am doing
is for you and our children.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.160
I need you to trust me.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.245
How can I trust you?

33:58.287 --> 34:01.415
I don't even know
what you're doing.

34:01.457 --> 34:05.377
I'm your husband.

34:07.921 --> 34:10.674
And you have to trust me.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.070
What's up?

38:01.571 --> 38:03.281
How much more time do you need?

38:03.323 --> 38:04.700
They're almost done.

38:04.741 --> 38:06.326
Maybe 15, 20 minutes.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.240
Shit! I'll call you back.

41:41.374 --> 41:42.334
Let's go!

41:42.375 --> 41:44.544
Why are you stopping? Move!

41:53.011 --> 41:54.262
Where the fuck are you going?

42:35.887 --> 42:37.013
Help me...

42:37.055 --> 42:38.932
Show your hands.
Down on your knees.

42:40.141 --> 42:42.394
Please!
