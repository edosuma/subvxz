01:25.722 --> 01:27.521
Hey, Jose.

01:27.523 --> 01:29.556
The way you drive around
in this taco wagon,

01:29.558 --> 01:31.424
you'd think
you'd want to be deported.

01:31.426 --> 01:32.994
Okay, <i>culero.</i>

01:32.996 --> 01:34.294
Yeah.

01:48.178 --> 01:50.013
Oh, here he comes now.

01:55.418 --> 01:57.385
Fashionably late, Earl.

01:57.387 --> 01:59.420
Helen, Helen, Helen.

01:59.422 --> 02:00.688
You look sensational.
Sensational.

02:00.690 --> 02:02.456
Aw. You look
pretty good yourself.

02:02.458 --> 02:03.691
It's been a long time.

02:03.693 --> 02:04.960
I brought you
a little something

02:04.962 --> 02:06.195
from my latest cultivar.

02:06.197 --> 02:09.131
Oh! You charming old devil.
This is lovely.

02:09.133 --> 02:10.264
Yes, I'll sign in right here.

02:10.267 --> 02:11.699
Hi.

02:11.701 --> 02:12.968
- Okay.
- So talented.

02:17.074 --> 02:18.676
Tim Kennedy.

02:19.176 --> 02:20.576
My God.

02:20.578 --> 02:22.744
As I live and breathe.
I thought you were dead.

02:22.746 --> 02:25.583
No such luck, I guess.

02:26.617 --> 02:28.717
Let me tell you something.

02:28.719 --> 02:30.419
Did anyone ever tell you

02:30.421 --> 02:32.054
you're a bit
of an asshole, Earl?

02:32.056 --> 02:33.589
- All the time.
- All the time.

02:33.591 --> 02:35.057
- Even in Spanish.
- Yeah, okay.

02:35.059 --> 02:37.092
Oh, ladies.
You're on the wrong floor.

02:37.094 --> 02:39.494
Third floor
is the beauty pageant.

02:39.496 --> 02:42.698
Oh, Earl.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.567
It's literally so easy.
My niece set this up for me.

02:45.569 --> 02:47.036
You just click one button

02:47.038 --> 02:48.770
and you can buy
whatever you want.

02:48.772 --> 02:50.206
With one click from home,

02:50.208 --> 02:52.108
you get a choice of everything
on our line.

02:52.110 --> 02:53.642
All the information is sent

02:53.644 --> 02:55.178
and the flowers arrive to you
just two days later.

02:55.180 --> 02:56.578
The first person to sign up

02:56.580 --> 02:58.680
gets a 20% discount
off their first order.

02:58.682 --> 03:01.516
Internet. Who needs it?

03:01.518 --> 03:03.720
There you go.

03:03.722 --> 03:06.122
- Hi, Earl. They're beautiful.
- All right.

03:06.124 --> 03:09.158
Here, you get some.
And here, you take these.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.525
Thanks, Earl.

03:10.527 --> 03:12.262
Oh, you're most welcome.
You're most welcome.

03:12.264 --> 03:13.930
You're most welcome.

03:13.932 --> 03:15.231
Yes, ma'am.

03:15.233 --> 03:19.035
Here's some. And for you.
Yeah, you're most welcome.

03:19.037 --> 03:21.070
- Earl!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:21.072 --> 03:24.807
You'd think I'm giving away
free Viagra or something.

03:24.809 --> 03:26.175
What's going on here?

03:26.177 --> 03:28.411
- Thanks, Earl.
- I'll take one, Earl!

03:28.413 --> 03:29.979
I'll take one, too.

03:29.981 --> 03:33.317
I just... A wonderful thing
you're doing here today.

03:33.319 --> 03:35.352
Earl, is that Jimmy Stewart?

03:35.354 --> 03:36.819
<i>And now,</i>

03:36.821 --> 03:38.188
<i>the moment
we've all been waiting for.</i>

03:38.190 --> 03:41.225
<i>The NDL 2005
Gold Medal winner is</i>

03:41.227 --> 03:42.960
<i>Earl Stone,</i>

03:42.962 --> 03:46.596
<i>with his Sunnyside Meadows'
Illinois Majestic daylily.</i>

03:46.598 --> 03:47.664
<i>Earl!</i>

04:00.646 --> 04:03.681
- Congratulations again, Earl.
- Thank you.

04:03.683 --> 04:07.084
<i>No booing, no booing.
Thank you very much.</i>

04:07.086 --> 04:10.322
<i>And rather than give a long,
boring speech,</i>

04:10.324 --> 04:12.623
<i>I just wanted to tell you
a little joke. And that's...</i>

04:12.625 --> 04:16.927
<i>Why did the horticulturist
walk across the hotel lobby?</i>

04:16.928 --> 04:18.629
Why?

04:18.630 --> 04:20.064
<i>'Cause he wanted
to get to the bar,</i>

04:20.065 --> 04:21.732
<i>and that's exactly
where I'm headed.</i>

04:21.733 --> 04:23.467
<i>Thank you!</i>

04:29.943 --> 04:33.411
Where is he?
He'll be here, right?

04:33.413 --> 04:34.881
Don't hold your breath, honey.

04:36.950 --> 04:39.417
Grandpa Earl will be here.
He promised.

04:39.419 --> 04:41.520
Oh, my poor girls.

04:48.562 --> 04:49.961
There's no sign of him.

04:49.963 --> 04:52.866
Well, he'll be here.
It's my wedding day.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.834
I love you, Iris, I do.

04:55.836 --> 04:58.371
But you have to face facts.

04:58.373 --> 05:01.340
Your father has always
chose work over family.

05:01.342 --> 05:02.841
He missed your baptism,

05:02.843 --> 05:06.178
your confirmation,
your graduation.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.346
Countless birthdays.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.647
Not to mention
most of our anniversaries.

05:10.984 --> 05:12.584
I think I'm going to be sick.

05:12.586 --> 05:15.254
Who's gonna give Mommy away?

05:15.256 --> 05:18.057
Oh, well...

05:18.059 --> 05:21.060
- Oh, honey, my sweet Ginny.
- Iris.

05:21.062 --> 05:24.063
Hon. Can we have
another little reload here?

05:24.065 --> 05:25.563
Another Crown Royal, Earl?

05:25.565 --> 05:27.867
Yeah. In fact,
get the whole bar one.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.638
Them, too? The wedding party?

05:34.308 --> 05:35.674
Them, too.

05:35.676 --> 05:38.110
All right.
A round for everybody on Earl!

05:38.112 --> 05:40.246
I'll drink to that.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.027
Okay.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.237
Here you go, <i>amigos.</i>

06:04.306 --> 06:06.041
Sorry it couldn't be more.

06:07.843 --> 06:10.077
Damn Internet,
it ruins everything.

06:10.079 --> 06:11.845
So what are you gonna do?

06:11.847 --> 06:14.881
I don't know. I've never been
a plan-B type of guy.

06:14.883 --> 06:17.086
- <i>Gracias, amigo.</i>
- My pleasure.

06:18.187 --> 06:19.188
Thank you.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.688
I'll find something.

06:21.690 --> 06:22.891
<i>Gracias.</i>

06:41.578 --> 06:43.710
Grandpa Earl! You're here!

06:43.712 --> 06:46.813
Yeah. Hey, Ginny.
You look wonderful.

06:46.815 --> 06:49.250
I knew you'd make it
to the pre-wedding brunch.

06:49.252 --> 06:50.752
Oh, I'm so excited.

06:52.388 --> 06:54.088
Is everything okay?

06:54.090 --> 06:55.722
Oh, yeah,
don't worry about that.

06:55.724 --> 06:57.458
That's just a minor setback.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.961
- It'll be just fine.
- Okay. Well, come on in.

06:59.963 --> 07:01.062
I don't care what they say.

07:01.064 --> 07:02.330
You're always welcome.
Come on.

07:02.332 --> 07:03.798
Okay.
All right, you first.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.133
I just gotta grab
something inside,

07:05.135 --> 07:06.336
then I'll introduce you
to everybody.

07:07.537 --> 07:08.905
Ooh.

07:10.507 --> 07:11.906
Oh, my God.

07:11.908 --> 07:13.609
You saved all my cards.

07:13.611 --> 07:16.277
Ever since
the first one you sent me,

07:16.279 --> 07:17.546
when I was nine.

07:17.548 --> 07:19.881
It was the Corn Palace?

07:19.883 --> 07:22.850
Um... Okay.
I want you to meet Mike.

07:22.852 --> 07:25.119
Okay? He's my fiance.
Don't forget.

07:25.121 --> 07:29.690
Fiance. All right.
Okay, fiance.

07:29.692 --> 07:30.791
You need help with that?

07:30.793 --> 07:31.959
It's fine. Thank you.

07:31.961 --> 07:33.430
- Mom.
- Jesus.

07:39.503 --> 07:42.070
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I can't stay if he's here.

07:42.072 --> 07:44.175
- I'll wait in the car, Mom.
- No. Honey.

07:44.774 --> 07:46.210
Honey.

07:47.778 --> 07:50.846
Oh, well, of course.

07:50.848 --> 07:53.348
You're not here because of
the wedding. No, no.

07:53.350 --> 07:56.752
You're here because you had
nowhere else to go.

07:56.754 --> 07:58.287
Again!

07:58.289 --> 08:01.423
And you promised Ginny you'd
help pay for the wedding.

08:01.425 --> 08:03.825
It's fine, Grandma.
We can just make it BYOB.

08:03.827 --> 08:06.762
No, it's not fine.
It's never been fine.

08:06.764 --> 08:07.829
Why don't you
knock it off?

08:07.831 --> 08:09.365
Oh, man, he's in deep shit.

08:09.367 --> 08:10.832
Just stop it.

08:10.834 --> 08:13.403
Come back doing the same
old shit all the time.

08:13.405 --> 08:14.937
How dare you come in here

08:14.939 --> 08:16.372
and make all this fuss
right here in front of her.

08:16.374 --> 08:17.973
Because you weren't there
for your own daughter,

08:17.975 --> 08:20.243
and now you're letting
down your granddaughter?

08:20.245 --> 08:22.278
But it's no big surprise,
you know why?

08:22.280 --> 08:23.479
Yeah, why?

08:23.481 --> 08:25.248
You were never a real father
or a husband.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.150
I was on the road
60 hours a week

08:27.152 --> 08:28.784
to provide for this family.

08:28.786 --> 08:30.520
What the hell
are you talking about?

08:30.522 --> 08:34.557
On the road providing?
Ha! You know what you do?

08:34.558 --> 08:36.426
You play with your friends.

08:36.428 --> 08:39.095
You sit around and hand
each other trophies

08:39.097 --> 08:41.698
- for watching seeds sprout.
- Trophies?

08:41.701 --> 08:43.835
- Mr. Daylily.
- You fucking...

08:45.537 --> 08:47.172
Ginny, come here, please.

08:52.712 --> 08:55.446
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

08:55.448 --> 08:56.879
It's okay, Grandma.
Thank you.

08:56.881 --> 08:57.916
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.

09:00.852 --> 09:02.819
They did the alterations.

09:02.821 --> 09:04.655
I'll see you next week,
sweet girl.

09:04.657 --> 09:06.359
Thank you, Grandma.

09:13.299 --> 09:16.235
I'm sorry, darling. I'm sorry.

09:17.303 --> 09:19.071
I'll be going.

09:20.772 --> 09:23.209
Be right back.

09:26.612 --> 09:29.681
Bitch. Bitch.

09:29.683 --> 09:31.050
Hey, man.

09:33.953 --> 09:36.688
Weddings make everyone crazy.

09:36.690 --> 09:38.623
Always some kind of drama.

09:38.625 --> 09:40.527
Yeah. You got that right.

09:43.062 --> 09:45.296
Looks like you covered
some ground in your day.

09:45.298 --> 09:46.864
Yeah.

09:46.866 --> 09:49.933
Forty-one states out of 50.

09:49.935 --> 09:52.803
Never had a ticket, nothing.
Just drive.

09:52.805 --> 09:54.239
I never had a problem.

09:54.241 --> 09:57.007
This old truck is great.
Got a good record.

09:57.009 --> 09:58.909
- No tickets, huh?
- Nah-uh.

09:58.911 --> 10:00.211
Never had one.

10:00.213 --> 10:02.347
Ever in my life,
I've never had one.

10:02.349 --> 10:04.549
My grandpa was
a real road warrior, too.

10:04.551 --> 10:05.849
He loved to drive.

10:05.851 --> 10:08.155
Yeah. Well,
let's hear it for gramps.

10:08.855 --> 10:10.588
I'm Richard. Rico.

10:10.590 --> 10:12.891
I'm a friend of one of
Ginny's bridesmaids.

10:12.893 --> 10:15.060
Yeah, okay, Rico.
My name's Earl.

10:15.062 --> 10:18.463
Hey, Earl, you know,
if you're really stuck...

10:18.465 --> 10:21.833
I know some people who would
pay you to just drive,

10:21.835 --> 10:23.303
one city to another.

10:24.004 --> 10:25.606
Pay me to just drive?

10:26.774 --> 10:28.407
What do you get
out of it, slick?

10:29.876 --> 10:31.343
All I'm saying is,
I have friends

10:31.345 --> 10:34.279
looking for cautious drivers
like you.

10:34.281 --> 10:35.348
Yeah.

10:35.350 --> 10:37.984
You could help
your granddaughter.

10:39.853 --> 10:41.888
All righty.

10:46.227 --> 10:47.493
Huh.

10:47.495 --> 10:49.163
Just drive.

10:49.797 --> 10:52.600
Okay. All right.

11:03.077 --> 11:05.947
It says "tire shop,"
but which one?

11:48.724 --> 11:50.390
<i>Hola.</i> I'm Earl.

11:50.392 --> 11:52.426
<i>Hola, hola,</i> Earl.

11:52.428 --> 11:54.961
Where do you want us to
cut the compartment, huh?

11:54.963 --> 11:57.063
Under the seat?
The wheel well?

11:57.065 --> 11:58.967
Do what to the compartment?

12:00.102 --> 12:01.671
Cut up your truck.

12:03.573 --> 12:07.475
What are you talking about?
Cutting up the...

12:07.477 --> 12:11.044
Look, nobody's gonna cut up
this truck, understand?

12:11.046 --> 12:13.079
Put whatever you want
right back there,

12:13.081 --> 12:15.351
next to the golf clubs.
It'll be safe.

12:16.018 --> 12:17.420
No problem.

12:20.723 --> 12:22.924
You're fucking crazy, huh?

12:22.926 --> 12:24.425
Yeah.

12:28.198 --> 12:30.364
- Take it.
- What's this?

12:30.366 --> 12:32.268
You answer this,
day or night...

12:33.703 --> 12:35.203
But you don't call anyone.

12:35.205 --> 12:38.441
When you get to the drop,
someone will text you.

12:38.876 --> 12:40.076
Text?

12:40.911 --> 12:43.110
You know how to text?

12:43.112 --> 12:44.545
Well...

12:48.184 --> 12:50.454
Hold on to the phone.

12:53.791 --> 12:58.360
If it rings, you answer. Here.

12:58.362 --> 13:01.663
When you get to the hotel,
park your truck.

13:01.665 --> 13:05.132
Put the keys
in the glove compartment.

13:05.134 --> 13:07.135
Then come back in an hour.

13:07.137 --> 13:08.570
Your money

13:08.572 --> 13:11.173
will be in the glove
compartment with the keys.

13:11.175 --> 13:13.075
Do you understand?

13:13.077 --> 13:14.543
<i>Si, si.</i>

13:14.545 --> 13:16.545
I understand.
But what would happen

13:16.547 --> 13:19.183
if somebody steals the money
or my truck?

13:20.184 --> 13:22.017
No one will fuck with it.

13:22.019 --> 13:23.721
We got eyes everywhere,
<i>viejito.</i>

13:24.856 --> 13:26.455
<i>Oye, viejito.</i>

13:26.457 --> 13:28.691
Do yourself a favor.

13:28.693 --> 13:30.526
Don't look in that bag.

13:30.528 --> 13:33.161
You might think
you can identify us,

13:33.163 --> 13:35.230
or know
about this tire shop,

13:35.232 --> 13:37.667
but don't forget,

13:37.669 --> 13:40.135
we know who you are.

13:40.137 --> 13:41.336
<i>Comprende.</i>

13:41.338 --> 13:44.241
I'm not gonna look
in anybody's bag.

13:45.010 --> 13:47.211
Okay, papa.

13:51.148 --> 13:52.484
Thank you.

14:01.326 --> 14:02.827
Come on.

14:08.433 --> 14:09.434
<i>Adios!</i>

14:14.774 --> 14:17.708
Welcome to the team,
Agent Bates.

14:17.710 --> 14:19.075
Thank you, sir.

14:19.077 --> 14:21.645
Go ahead and have a seat.

14:21.647 --> 14:24.815
So, how's your family
adjusting to the move?

14:24.817 --> 14:26.517
Do they like the city?

14:26.519 --> 14:28.686
I'm assuming
you don't want the truth.

14:28.688 --> 14:30.054
No.

14:30.056 --> 14:32.656
Listen, you made some
big cases in New York and D.C.

14:32.658 --> 14:34.792
and I'm expecting you
to do the same thing here.

14:34.794 --> 14:36.460
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

14:36.462 --> 14:38.529
No one wants to sit through
these long Chicago winters

14:38.531 --> 14:40.998
but we got crime
coming out of our ass.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.633
That's how
you get out of here.

14:42.635 --> 14:47.072
Work hard, make cases,
make busts, make your name.

14:47.074 --> 14:48.973
Then maybe you can move on.

14:48.975 --> 14:52.010
Well, that's the best news
I've heard all week.

14:52.012 --> 14:53.912
Good.

14:53.914 --> 14:57.082
Now get out there and make
a splash, Special Agent.

14:57.084 --> 14:58.451
Yes, sir.

15:02.956 --> 15:04.089
Agent Bates?

15:04.091 --> 15:05.389
- Agent Trevino?
- Yes, sir.

15:05.391 --> 15:07.324
- Pleasure.
- So, I'll be your number one.

15:07.326 --> 15:09.293
- Yeah, I heard. It's an honor.
- Yeah.

15:09.295 --> 15:11.462
- Uh, how you feeling?
- I feel good.

15:11.464 --> 15:13.665
Ready to make a big splash?

15:13.667 --> 15:15.967
- He says that to everybody.
- Yeah, he does.

15:15.969 --> 15:17.368
That's all right.

15:17.370 --> 15:20.338
So your office is out here,
to the right.

15:20.340 --> 15:22.340
Well, I'm not gonna spend
too much time there.

15:22.342 --> 15:24.042
Hopefully not.

15:24.044 --> 15:26.511
<i>Jesus
says that he came to seek</i>

15:26.513 --> 15:29.781
<i>and save that which is lost.</i>

15:35.856 --> 15:38.991
<i>♪ Spending time with you</i>

15:38.993 --> 15:44.398
<i>♪ I love you more today
than yesterday</i>

15:45.699 --> 15:51.336
<i>♪ But not as much
as tomorrow ♪</i>

16:34.482 --> 16:39.086
Jesus, it's like the <i>Star Wars</i>
cantina in there.

16:39.088 --> 16:41.620
Yeah, it's where
all the homies hang out.

16:41.622 --> 16:44.490
It doesn't look
like a <i>TED Talks.</i>

16:44.492 --> 16:46.827
It's my kid's.
He helps me pack.

16:46.829 --> 16:47.894
You got kids?

16:47.896 --> 16:50.163
Yeah, five of 'em.

16:50.165 --> 16:53.334
Five. How do you make
that work in a job like this?

16:54.369 --> 16:55.971
We just make it work.

16:59.608 --> 17:02.342
Ah, the plot thins.

17:02.344 --> 17:04.310
- Why's that?
- This is our guy.

17:04.313 --> 17:06.682
Yeah.

17:12.788 --> 17:14.455
Right there.

17:45.021 --> 17:46.389
Shit.

17:53.296 --> 17:55.365
Oh, shit.

18:02.505 --> 18:04.672
- Yeah?
- You did good.

18:04.674 --> 18:05.873
Supposed to tell you
to call this number

18:05.875 --> 18:07.142
any time you need work,
all right?

18:07.144 --> 18:08.709
Here you go.

18:08.711 --> 18:11.581
No, no, no, no. This is just
a one-time deal for me.

18:12.448 --> 18:13.849
Well, I tell you what, man,

18:13.851 --> 18:15.616
why don't you call us
if you change your mind?

18:15.618 --> 18:18.022
You know what I'm saying?
Here you go. Take the number.

18:18.956 --> 18:21.557
Here.

18:21.559 --> 18:22.891
Why don't you save that
for a rainy day?

18:22.893 --> 18:24.026
Yeah.

18:24.028 --> 18:26.161
Yeah, a rainy day. Okay.

18:26.163 --> 18:28.263
All right, let's go. Come on.
Let's move it up out of here.

18:28.265 --> 18:29.466
All right.

18:30.768 --> 18:32.401
All right.

18:35.472 --> 18:39.107
It's the starter,
the starter's pretty ratty.

18:43.347 --> 18:44.680
Let's go. Come on.
Back it up.

18:44.682 --> 18:46.117
All right. I got it.

19:00.531 --> 19:02.598
Everybody's
on their cell phone.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.933
It's becoming an epidemic.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.134
What do you think
you're doing?

19:05.136 --> 19:06.435
Who the hell are you guys?

19:06.437 --> 19:08.370
My name is
Special Agent Colin Bates,

19:08.372 --> 19:09.873
this is Agent Trevino.

19:09.875 --> 19:11.741
We're with the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

19:11.743 --> 19:13.943
And you're Luis Rocha.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.179
And we're here
to save your life.

19:16.181 --> 19:17.914
I beg your pardon?

19:17.916 --> 19:20.149
We're gonna make sure
your cartel doesn't know

19:20.151 --> 19:22.118
you're working for the DEA.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.853
I'm not working for the DEA.

19:23.855 --> 19:25.555
No, but that's what they'll
think if you don't,

19:25.557 --> 19:28.225
so welcome aboard.

19:28.227 --> 19:30.160
Wait, I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:30.162 --> 19:31.895
- I like the Tahitian Pearl.
- Mmm.

19:31.897 --> 19:33.630
- It's got, like, a nice sheen.
- Mmm.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.167
Think about it, Luis.

19:37.869 --> 19:40.271
We got a warrant
to search your house.

19:40.273 --> 19:41.504
What?

19:41.506 --> 19:42.805
Yeah,
we'll see you there.

19:55.688 --> 19:57.688
Hi. I'm gonna interrupt
for a second.

19:57.690 --> 19:59.424
- I'm sorry.
- He's yours.

20:16.410 --> 20:18.243
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

20:18.245 --> 20:22.213
<i>Before I get over-served...</i>

20:22.215 --> 20:24.615
<i>...we'd just like to take
a moment</i>

20:24.617 --> 20:26.719
<i>to say thank you. Um...</i>

20:27.620 --> 20:29.120
<i>Mom,</i>

20:29.122 --> 20:30.454
<i>I love you.</i>

20:30.456 --> 20:32.223
- Aw.
- <i>I love you so much.</i>

20:32.225 --> 20:35.026
<i>Grandma Mary,
thank you so, so much</i>

20:35.028 --> 20:36.660
<i>for everything
that you've done.</i>

20:36.662 --> 20:39.264
<i>Um... Oh.</i>

20:39.266 --> 20:42.834
<i>And to my Grandpa Earl,</i>

20:42.836 --> 20:45.236
<i>who brought the flowers,
of course.</i>

20:45.238 --> 20:47.941
<i>And covered the open bar.</i>

20:51.712 --> 20:53.080
<i>So, thank you.</i>

21:05.993 --> 21:06.994
Hi.

21:08.829 --> 21:09.830
Hey.

21:11.299 --> 21:12.632
You look lovely tonight.

21:19.073 --> 21:20.572
It's kinda funny,

21:20.574 --> 21:22.574
our granddaughter
getting married.

21:22.576 --> 21:26.846
And we worried all those years
about her finding Mr. Right.

21:26.848 --> 21:28.546
Earl, why do you think

21:28.548 --> 21:29.949
you could just sit down

21:29.951 --> 21:32.985
and expect me to forget
about the past and

21:32.987 --> 21:35.890
reminisce about old times?

21:37.592 --> 21:42.429
Well, we had 10 good years.

21:42.431 --> 21:44.198
We can still be civil.

21:52.274 --> 21:53.608
Care to dance?

21:54.776 --> 21:56.677
You always liked this tune.

21:57.146 --> 21:58.147
I do.

21:59.847 --> 22:03.851
No, I can't. I just can't.

22:04.619 --> 22:06.920
I can't.

22:06.922 --> 22:09.557
I see you're still
into your flowers.

22:10.092 --> 22:11.158
Yeah.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.960
I never understood
how you could spend

22:13.962 --> 22:17.199
so much time
and money on them.

22:20.135 --> 22:24.738
I love 'em.
I mean, they're unique.

22:24.740 --> 22:26.873
They just bloom one day

22:26.875 --> 22:29.209
and that's the end of it.

22:29.211 --> 22:31.747
They deserve
all the time and effort.

22:32.815 --> 22:35.784
So did your family.

23:31.875 --> 23:34.278
Not bad, <i>viejito,</i>
not bad.

23:35.546 --> 23:37.479
Damn!

23:37.481 --> 23:39.281
Badass, right there.

23:39.283 --> 23:40.882
New ride. Nice.

23:40.884 --> 23:43.651
Yeah. Badass is right.

23:43.653 --> 23:45.187
- Yeah.
- This is beautiful.

23:45.189 --> 23:48.125
Yeah, the old one
finally quit on me.

23:50.361 --> 23:52.728
Hey, Earl.

23:52.730 --> 23:55.397
- Got a little present for you.
- Oh.

23:55.399 --> 23:57.166
Oh, what's in that?

23:57.168 --> 23:59.401
Your <i>jale,</i> old man.
Your cargo.

23:59.403 --> 24:04.275
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

24:06.844 --> 24:08.112
All right.

24:11.115 --> 24:12.382
Hey, what's going on,
big poppa?

24:12.384 --> 24:14.016
Yeah, good.
Just everything good.

24:14.018 --> 24:15.418
I'm just on the road again.

24:15.420 --> 24:17.920
- You're king pimping, huh?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

24:17.922 --> 24:19.922
Kind of like that.

24:19.924 --> 24:22.125
- Yeah?
- Same as before.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.994
It rings, you answer.
Day or night.

24:24.996 --> 24:26.329
Yeah, well, you know,

24:26.331 --> 24:27.896
I've got this other one
from before, too.

24:27.898 --> 24:30.567
- Oh, yeah. Let me see.
- Yeah.

24:30.569 --> 24:32.736
- Yep.
- Ah, I see.

24:35.173 --> 24:38.808
Hey, that was
a perfectly good phone.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.678
What's going on?

24:40.680 --> 24:43.479
Earl, you throw
your phone away

24:43.481 --> 24:45.782
when your run is done.

24:45.784 --> 24:48.386
I don't suppose you learned
how to text yet either, huh?

24:49.555 --> 24:51.589
Uh, I can text.

24:51.591 --> 24:52.922
I'll be able to.

24:52.924 --> 24:55.024
Next time you see me,
I'll be texting.

24:55.026 --> 24:56.460
Texting my brains out.

24:56.462 --> 24:57.595
Okay.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.128
Looking good, <i>abuelito.</i>

24:59.130 --> 25:00.865
Okay.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.537
Hey, Earl.

25:06.539 --> 25:07.837
Yeah?

25:07.839 --> 25:09.106
Same hotel as before.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.609
Yeah, same hotel.
I'll be there.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.045
Okay.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.279
<i>Vamos.</i>

26:24.384 --> 26:26.251
1980 Shovelhead.

26:26.253 --> 26:28.155
I ran one of those things
into the ground.

26:29.189 --> 26:32.560
It'll probably be
the relay, son.

26:33.628 --> 26:35.162
Who you calling "son"?

26:36.830 --> 26:38.264
Oh, you're gals, huh?

26:38.266 --> 26:42.368
Gals? Come on, old-timer,
we're dykes on bikes.

26:42.370 --> 26:43.436
No shit.

26:45.906 --> 26:47.306
Okay, well.

26:47.308 --> 26:49.610
So, you think
that's the issue? The relay?

26:50.745 --> 26:52.478
It's a good early check.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.480
It'll be the relay.

26:54.482 --> 26:55.616
Thanks, Pops.

26:57.218 --> 26:58.986
You're welcome, dykes.

27:32.287 --> 27:34.590
- You crazy motherfucker.
- Crazy old man.

27:35.758 --> 27:38.058
Think about our offer, <i>amigo?</i>

27:38.060 --> 27:42.062
Uh, no. And I'm Filipino,
not Mexican.

27:42.064 --> 27:43.630
Oh. Well, that's a good thing.

27:43.632 --> 27:46.233
It'll be harder for the cartel
to get to your family.

27:46.235 --> 27:49.436
Why do you think
I'd work for you guys?

27:49.438 --> 27:53.173
I mean, we found drugs,
$425,000 in cash

27:53.175 --> 27:55.610
and three unlicensed firearms
in your house,

27:55.612 --> 27:57.177
so I mean, that's a start.

27:57.179 --> 27:59.647
Not to mention fraud,
tax evasion, money laundering,

27:59.649 --> 28:01.348
state and federal drug laws
you've broken.

28:01.350 --> 28:02.817
I mean, conservatively,
I'd say

28:02.819 --> 28:04.386
you're looking at back-to-back
life sentences.

28:06.155 --> 28:08.389
And I'm no psychic, but...

28:08.391 --> 28:10.858
Looking at your manicured
nails and your exfoliated skin

28:10.860 --> 28:12.326
and your scented candles,

28:12.328 --> 28:13.628
I don't think you're gonna
fare too well in prison.

28:13.630 --> 28:15.263
Oh, it's definitely
bitch material.

28:15.265 --> 28:17.732
You'd be somebody's girlfriend
in a day.

28:17.734 --> 28:19.734
You wouldn't like that,
would you?

28:19.736 --> 28:21.769
And that's before
the cartel gets to you.

28:21.771 --> 28:25.041
So, what do you think, Luis?
Are we gonna be friends?

28:26.576 --> 28:28.409
What do I do?

28:28.411 --> 28:30.344
Just do your job,
go back to work,

28:30.346 --> 28:31.612
be a good cartel employee

28:31.614 --> 28:32.982
and answer my calls
day and night.

28:34.751 --> 28:36.352
- Okay.
- Good.

28:42.959 --> 28:44.425
The foreclosure
will be canceled

28:44.427 --> 28:45.861
with your
reinstatement payment.

28:45.863 --> 28:48.229
Plus late fees
and incidentals.

28:48.231 --> 28:49.633
You said you had cash?

28:50.066 --> 28:51.301
Yeah.

28:53.671 --> 28:55.205
Right here.

28:57.408 --> 28:58.409
Okay.

29:09.018 --> 29:11.388
Piece of shit. Motherfucker.

29:40.785 --> 29:42.785
The hell happened here? Fire?

29:42.787 --> 29:45.855
Yeah, in the kitchen.
Nobody got hurt.

29:45.857 --> 29:47.924
Oh, good.

29:47.926 --> 29:50.025
I'll have pancakes, then.

29:50.027 --> 29:52.162
Yeah. Yeah.

29:53.798 --> 29:57.100
Unfortunately, the insurance
company's jerking us around.

29:57.102 --> 29:59.135
We might not see
any money for years.

29:59.137 --> 30:00.603
Yeah.

30:00.605 --> 30:03.706
Well, I've been coming here
since '58.

30:03.708 --> 30:05.575
This place is like
an institution.

30:05.577 --> 30:08.044
I don't know what the hell
the vets are gonna do.

30:08.046 --> 30:09.648
I don't know.

30:12.885 --> 30:15.385
No Sunday night polka parties.

30:15.387 --> 30:17.021
No more meat raffles.

30:17.023 --> 30:21.391
What the hell, pretty soon
it'll be no more VFW.

30:21.393 --> 30:25.731
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, that is unless, uh...

30:28.066 --> 30:32.772
Not unless somebody's got
an extra 25K laying around.

30:35.541 --> 30:36.542
Hmm.

31:16.783 --> 31:18.049
How do, how do, how do.

31:18.051 --> 31:20.117
<i>Bienvenidos, Senor</i> Earl.
Welcome back.

31:20.119 --> 31:21.353
Oh, thank you, thank you.

31:21.355 --> 31:22.520
What's up, big poppa?

31:22.522 --> 31:23.655
Oh, not too much,
not too much.

31:23.657 --> 31:25.122
- Same old, same old.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:25.124 --> 31:26.825
Just on the highway.

31:26.827 --> 31:28.127
What's going on?

31:31.832 --> 31:34.301
Look at this. Wow.

31:35.235 --> 31:36.835
What's in that? That's big.

31:36.837 --> 31:38.505
Don't worry about it.

31:40.507 --> 31:43.608
- Hey, Earl?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.811
- It rings, you do what?
- I answer.

31:45.813 --> 31:47.612
- That's my man. Big poppa.
- Okay.

31:47.614 --> 31:48.814
I got you.

31:48.816 --> 31:50.750
Remember, <i>con cuidado</i>
when you drive.

31:50.752 --> 31:52.051
Just drive safely.

31:52.053 --> 31:53.351

- <i>Si.</i>

31:53.353 --> 31:56.523
Drive safely. All right. Okay.

31:58.826 --> 32:02.360
Hey, Earl.
Keep your eyes open.

32:02.362 --> 32:04.830
- All right. I will.
- All right.

32:04.832 --> 32:07.468
- Okay. All right.
- <i>Vamonos.</i>

33:04.860 --> 33:08.230
Holy shit. Holy shit.

33:09.398 --> 33:10.966

33:12.068 --> 33:14.267
Oh, uh... Officer, hi.

33:14.269 --> 33:15.502
Need any help?

33:15.504 --> 33:17.370
Uh, no, no.
I'm fine, thank you.

33:17.372 --> 33:18.772
- What do you got there?
- Uh...

33:18.774 --> 33:22.143
Pecans. I'm delivering pecans
to my niece.

33:22.145 --> 33:23.677
- Pecans?
- Yeah, pecans.

33:23.679 --> 33:25.980
She makes the worst pecan pie
you've ever tasted.

33:25.982 --> 33:28.216
I feel sorry
for her husband, but...

33:28.218 --> 33:29.616
And I feel sorry
for the pecans, too.

33:31.988 --> 33:33.921
I don't know
what's wrong with him now,

33:33.923 --> 33:36.924
but this dog has to pee
every 15 minutes.

33:36.926 --> 33:38.291
Dogs.

33:38.293 --> 33:40.463
Oh, shit.

33:44.734 --> 33:47.036
It's all right. All right,
calm down. Come on.

34:07.158 --> 34:08.322
Hi!

34:08.324 --> 34:11.594
Hi. Hi, doggy! How ya doing?

34:12.395 --> 34:13.728
Take a sniff of that.

34:13.731 --> 34:15.130
I'm sorry, sir,
I'm gonna have to ask you

34:15.132 --> 34:16.264
not to touch the animal.

34:16.266 --> 34:17.766
Oh.

34:17.768 --> 34:19.067
- I'm sorry, Officer.
- It's okay. It's okay, sir.

34:19.069 --> 34:20.501
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

34:20.503 --> 34:22.971
- My Dukie, I miss him so much.
- It's okay, sir.

34:22.973 --> 34:24.304
Dukie, you know,

34:24.306 --> 34:27.176
Dukie just one of those dogs
that everybody loves.

34:27.178 --> 34:28.577
- Drive safely, sir.
- Okay.

34:28.579 --> 34:30.045
- You can go now.
- Yeah, thank you.

34:30.047 --> 34:32.416
You do a great Jimmy Stewart,
by the way.

34:33.951 --> 34:35.518
Yeah. Fuck.

34:53.804 --> 34:55.571
Let me
explain something, Luis.

34:55.572 --> 34:56.973
For you to get
into witness protection,

34:56.975 --> 34:58.473
you're gonna have to
prove your value.

34:58.475 --> 35:00.176
We win, you win.

35:00.178 --> 35:02.111
So we're gonna go
on a little sightseeing tour.

35:02.113 --> 35:04.113
See what kind of value
you can offer.

35:04.115 --> 35:06.481
- You understand?
- Yeah.

35:06.483 --> 35:08.952
Good. Got you a latte.

35:13.258 --> 35:14.757
This is where it start,

35:14.759 --> 35:18.061
not just here, but dozens
of hotels across the city.

35:18.063 --> 35:21.631
Mules come in from
various locations, loaded,

35:21.633 --> 35:24.434
leave their vehicles,
someone takes the vehicles,

35:24.436 --> 35:25.902
removes the load,

35:25.904 --> 35:28.305
and returns it
with the mule's payment.

35:28.307 --> 35:32.243
At 121, there's a guy outside.
What's going on here?

35:32.245 --> 35:33.743
121 is ours.

35:33.745 --> 35:35.945
He's just there
to make sure that

35:35.947 --> 35:39.083
they keep an eye on the vans
that come in and out.

35:39.085 --> 35:40.518
What else?

36:05.211 --> 36:06.712
Fuck me.

36:09.015 --> 36:10.516

Yeah, come on.

45:32.591 --> 45:34.525
You get the tire out,
we'll fix it up.

45:35.025 --> 45:36.327
Yeah.

45:38.663 --> 45:41.431
- All right.
- Tire's in there. Great.

45:41.433 --> 45:43.198
- Uh...
- Okay. Keep going.

45:43.200 --> 45:45.368
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:45.370 --> 45:47.202
- Ah, here we go.
- Okay.

45:47.204 --> 45:49.873
There it is. Yeah.

45:49.875 --> 45:53.411
Well, this is good.
Helping you Negro folks out.

45:55.580 --> 45:58.348
"Negro"? Sir,
we don't say that anymore.

45:58.350 --> 46:00.750
Yeah, we prefer "black."

46:00.752 --> 46:02.418
- "Black" or "people."
- Or just "people."

46:02.420 --> 46:03.820
Yeah. I'm black, you're white.

46:03.822 --> 46:05.255
No shit.

46:05.257 --> 46:06.723
Yeah, no shit.

46:06.725 --> 46:09.626
Okay. Let me
give you a hand here.

46:09.628 --> 46:11.261
- I'll take the jack.
- Okay.

46:11.263 --> 46:13.331
- You get the tire.
- All right.

46:23.174 --> 46:25.176
You are so sweet.

46:28.313 --> 46:30.313
Hey.

46:30.315 --> 46:31.649
My turn.

46:31.651 --> 46:33.884
Oh, my God,
look at this.

46:33.886 --> 46:35.354
My God.

46:53.472 --> 46:55.139
- Would you like...
- Oh, yes.

46:55.141 --> 46:57.143
This is so nice.

47:51.465 --> 47:52.965
<i>Tata,</i> where are you going?

47:52.967 --> 47:54.299
The hotel is right up here!

47:55.502 --> 47:56.902
Move!

48:01.208 --> 48:02.877
Hey, move! Hey!

48:03.611 --> 48:05.278
Move! Okay.

48:10.485 --> 48:12.084
Where the hell is he?

48:12.086 --> 48:13.454
- Where's he going?
- Over here.

48:31.506 --> 48:34.275
Who the fuck are you,
<i>ruco?</i> Eh?

48:34.777 --> 48:36.275
I'm Earl.

48:36.277 --> 48:37.778
- Earl?
- Yeah. Earl.

48:37.780 --> 48:40.312
Earl who?
I don't know any fucking Earl.

48:40.314 --> 48:41.950
Earl, the driver.

48:45.754 --> 48:48.088
Get your fucking ass
inside, man.

48:59.968 --> 49:02.269
What the fuck
are you doing here, old man?

49:02.271 --> 49:06.306
I'm just bringing in
my load, that's all.

49:06.308 --> 49:09.209
But you're not supposed
to be here.

49:09.211 --> 49:12.279
Look, the address says
right here. Look.

49:12.281 --> 49:14.783
It's 771 Joy Drive.

49:15.718 --> 49:18.554
Okay. Just don't do it again.

49:20.422 --> 49:22.558
Who the fuck are you, <i>pendejo?</i>

49:23.325 --> 49:24.959
I'm his handler.

49:24.961 --> 49:28.062
Then handle him.
He ain't supposed to be here.

49:28.064 --> 49:30.365
I'll take care of it.

49:54.824 --> 49:55.825
Eh?

49:59.529 --> 50:01.362
Who sent you here?

50:01.364 --> 50:03.464
Who gave you this address?

50:03.466 --> 50:05.533
I don't know.
He was a big guy.

50:05.535 --> 50:08.336
Mexican-looking guy.
He had tattoos all over.

50:08.338 --> 50:10.873
Very scary,
at least to this gringo.

50:10.875 --> 50:13.742
Okay, that could be
anyone I know.

50:13.744 --> 50:14.977
What's his name?

50:14.979 --> 50:16.377
I don't know his name.

50:16.379 --> 50:17.578
What do I look like,
Alexander Graham Bell?

50:17.580 --> 50:18.814
I don't even know anything

50:18.816 --> 50:20.215
about texting
and all this shit.

50:20.217 --> 50:21.349
I don't know
whose name is who.

50:21.351 --> 50:22.618
- Okay. Okay.
- They all look

50:22.620 --> 50:23.554
the fucking same.

50:31.896 --> 50:33.262
You're a real pain in my ass,

50:33.264 --> 50:34.730
you know that?

50:34.732 --> 50:38.234
Then go see a proctologist.
Don't bother me.

50:38.236 --> 50:40.068
Stop. Where are you going?

50:40.070 --> 50:42.437
My pecans are in there.

50:42.439 --> 50:45.040
Fuck your pecans.
Let them do their job.

50:52.483 --> 50:55.419
What's up?

51:03.028 --> 51:05.228
Okay, slow down.
What did he do?

51:05.230 --> 51:06.796
What did he do?

51:06.798 --> 51:08.932
He stops wherever he wants.
Eh?

51:08.934 --> 51:10.934
He doesn't
follow my instructions.

51:10.936 --> 51:12.535
He doesn't do
what I tell him to do.

51:12.537 --> 51:14.369
Yesterday he stopped
to see an old friend.

51:14.371 --> 51:15.839
I'm just gonna kill him.

51:15.841 --> 51:17.607
- <i>I won't tolerate...</i>
- Slow down, slow down.

51:17.609 --> 51:19.175
Listen to me. Listen to me.

51:19.177 --> 51:22.345
He moves his own way.
He's been successful.

51:22.347 --> 51:25.348
If he changes his route,
it's probably better for us

51:25.350 --> 51:27.016
'cause then
he's less predictable.

51:27.018 --> 51:28.351
You understand me?

51:28.353 --> 51:30.587
Yeah, but we don't oblige
the other drivers like this.

51:30.589 --> 51:32.924
You need to oblige me.

51:33.592 --> 51:35.358
Understood?

51:35.360 --> 51:36.526
<i>Yeah, understood.</i>

51:36.528 --> 51:38.329
Stay with him.

51:38.331 --> 51:40.396
Make him feel at home.

51:40.398 --> 51:42.001
Other than that...

51:45.037 --> 51:46.806
How you doing?

51:47.639 --> 51:49.672
<i>I'm fine.</i>

51:49.674 --> 51:51.876
Okay. Do your job.

51:51.878 --> 51:53.478
<i>Si. Si.</i>

52:06.359 --> 52:07.892
What do you got?

52:07.894 --> 52:09.727
I'm taking all the risk here.

52:09.729 --> 52:11.929
If they found out that I'm
talking to you guys, I'm dead.

52:11.931 --> 52:13.597
Maybe don't work
with drug dealers.

52:13.599 --> 52:16.502
Got you a latte. Feel better?

52:17.637 --> 52:19.870
So what do you got for us?

52:19.872 --> 52:22.307
I don't know
if I should be doing this.

52:22.309 --> 52:23.910
Oh, what do you got?

52:26.380 --> 52:27.680
What's this?

52:28.382 --> 52:30.616
It's a freight manifest.

52:31.285 --> 52:33.285
What is this? Code?

52:33.287 --> 52:34.618
Symbols for each
of the mules

52:34.620 --> 52:36.620
along with symbols
for their routes,

52:36.622 --> 52:38.522
dates, and cargo loads.

52:38.524 --> 52:40.792
There's this
new drug mule, <i>Tata.</i>

52:40.794 --> 52:44.195
New guy. He's delivered
121 kilos in April,

52:44.197 --> 52:46.698
172 kilos in May,

52:46.700 --> 52:48.934
and then 232 kilos.

52:48.936 --> 52:50.635
Jesus Christ.
Could that be right?

52:50.637 --> 52:52.570
This guy's nickname's,
uh, <i>Tata?</i>

52:52.572 --> 52:54.572
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's <i>Tata.</i>

52:54.574 --> 52:56.775
That's good. Good work.

52:56.777 --> 52:58.877
I'm just gonna need
to document this.

52:58.879 --> 53:01.446
I gotta get that back before
they know it's gone, though.

53:01.448 --> 53:02.881
So if I can just take it now.

53:02.883 --> 53:04.816
It's just gonna take a second,
so just relax.

53:04.818 --> 53:08.019
You play hard to get
for a snitch.

53:08.021 --> 53:10.956
And you end up
snitching anyway.

53:10.958 --> 53:12.657
I just need...

53:12.659 --> 53:14.226
Just think about
who else you can snitch on

53:14.228 --> 53:15.760
while you're waiting.

53:15.762 --> 53:16.996
No. Come on. I'm just...

53:16.998 --> 53:18.864
Reflect on that.

53:18.866 --> 53:20.166
I'm showing
my worth though, right?

53:20.168 --> 53:21.400
I mean, this is...

53:21.402 --> 53:22.567
You did great.

53:22.569 --> 53:23.803
I know enough
for me to get in.

53:23.805 --> 53:24.971
Here we go.
Good job, thank you.

53:24.973 --> 53:26.272
Get the fuck out of here.

53:26.274 --> 53:27.809
Jesus Christ.

53:40.755 --> 53:43.656
<i>♪ Dang me, hang me</i>

53:43.658 --> 53:45.725
<i>♪ Oughta take a rope
and hang me</i>

53:45.727 --> 53:48.561
<i>♪ Hang me
from the highest tree</i>

53:48.563 --> 53:50.832
<i>♪ Woman,
would you weep for me?</i>

54:02.378 --> 54:04.510
<i>♪ Woman,
would you weep for me? ♪</i>

54:12.687 --> 54:14.187
He couldn't wait.

54:14.189 --> 54:16.189
Doesn't know how to
fucking drive. Look at him.

54:16.191 --> 54:18.625
Relax, okay?

54:18.627 --> 54:19.659
We need to trust him.

54:19.661 --> 54:21.128
What else are we gonna do?

54:21.130 --> 54:22.097
We have no other choice.

54:47.090 --> 54:48.924
Okay. Thank you.

55:00.236 --> 55:01.936
There you go.

55:01.938 --> 55:03.907
Everyone keeps looking at us.

55:05.075 --> 55:07.742
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
they see two beaners

55:07.744 --> 55:10.013
in a bowl full of crackers.

55:14.350 --> 55:15.718
Why are we here?

55:16.554 --> 55:18.052
The best pulled pork sandwich

55:18.054 --> 55:19.689
in the whole Midwest,
that's why.

55:32.436 --> 55:34.001
Not bad, huh?

55:34.003 --> 55:36.838
See, what you gotta do is take
more time out, like this.

55:36.840 --> 55:39.640
Enjoy life. Like I do.

55:39.642 --> 55:41.245
Maybe.

55:43.314 --> 55:46.515
Or maybe you enjoyed
the moment a little too much.

55:46.517 --> 55:49.084
Had too much fun.

55:49.086 --> 55:51.355
That's why you're working
for us now.

55:56.160 --> 55:59.663
Best pulled pork sandwich
in the whole wide world.

56:06.804 --> 56:08.404
No more stopping, <i>Tata.</i>

56:08.406 --> 56:09.874
You stay on route.

56:10.941 --> 56:12.810
Losing my patience.

56:14.945 --> 56:16.814
What's your business here?

56:17.549 --> 56:18.615
Hmm?

56:20.851 --> 56:23.986
I ain't gonna ask you again.

56:23.988 --> 56:26.358
What's your business
in my town?

56:28.826 --> 56:31.027
Officer. Officer.

56:31.029 --> 56:32.595
I can vouch for these fellas.

56:32.597 --> 56:33.729
They're actually
working for me.

56:33.731 --> 56:35.031
You know this guy?

56:35.033 --> 56:38.034
Oh, yeah.
I got 'em down at Home Depot.

56:38.036 --> 56:39.836
They came out here, and
they've been helping me move.

56:39.838 --> 56:41.504
Great job.

56:41.506 --> 56:43.306
A lot cheaper than the moving
company, I'll tell you that.

56:43.308 --> 56:45.875
Terrific job.

56:45.877 --> 56:47.911
Yeah, could you come over here
for a second?

56:47.913 --> 56:49.179
There's something
very important

56:49.181 --> 56:50.680
I want to show you
in this truck.

56:50.682 --> 56:52.015
Right here.

56:52.017 --> 56:54.786
Really important.
Really important.

57:08.267 --> 57:09.768
You'll love this.

57:12.505 --> 57:15.705
I went to a charity and I got
this caramelized corn.

57:15.707 --> 57:17.007
And it is really
terrific stuff.

57:17.009 --> 57:18.542
We can't accept
this kind of stuff.

57:18.544 --> 57:20.277
Oh, you'll be doing me
a great favor, if you would.

57:20.279 --> 57:22.980
I've got diabetes.
I can't have it.

57:22.982 --> 57:24.582
They'd love it
down at the station.

57:24.584 --> 57:27.987
And the gals upstairs,
they'll love it, too.

57:30.923 --> 57:32.790
Thank you for helping me, sir.

57:32.792 --> 57:34.493
All right, sir?

57:40.299 --> 57:42.434
I'm very big
on law enforcement.

57:42.436 --> 57:44.338
Very supportive.

57:45.472 --> 57:47.773
We appreciate what you do.

57:51.110 --> 57:53.110
Yes. Yes.

57:53.112 --> 57:54.845
- <i>Our numbers are down, Special Agent.</i>
- I realize we're down.

57:54.847 --> 57:56.248
The numbers
don't reflect the actuals,

57:56.250 --> 57:58.049
and will be adjusted
by the end of the day.

57:58.051 --> 57:59.152
- <i>Fix 'em and send 'em over...</i>
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

57:59.620 --> 58:00.719
<i>Today.</i>

58:00.721 --> 58:02.420
Yes, sir.

58:02.422 --> 58:03.622
What?

58:03.624 --> 58:06.024
Cartel's top mule's
on his way to a drop.

58:06.026 --> 58:07.626
So we know the route.
We know it's a black pickup.

58:07.628 --> 58:10.462
It's a needle in a haystack,
but at least it's a start.

58:10.464 --> 58:11.865
How do we know this?

58:12.766 --> 58:14.532
Phone tap.

58:14.534 --> 58:16.067
They thought their mule
was in an accident.

58:16.069 --> 58:18.438
Turns out it was a pickup
on Interstate 55.

58:19.139 --> 58:20.405
When's he due to arrive?

58:20.407 --> 58:22.907
9:00 p.m.
That puts us five hours out.

58:22.909 --> 58:24.442
So if we have
local law enforcement

58:24.444 --> 58:25.810
stop vehicles
of that description,

58:25.812 --> 58:27.412
do a random road check,

58:27.414 --> 58:28.913
we can catch this guy without
tipping off the cartel.

58:28.915 --> 58:30.383
This is the guy
you think is moving

58:30.385 --> 58:32.551
over 100 kilos
into Chicago a month?

58:32.553 --> 58:33.653
Mmm-hmm.

58:33.655 --> 58:35.086
100 kilos is overzealous,

58:35.088 --> 58:36.988
considering
we're only confiscating

58:36.990 --> 58:39.191
five kilos a month.

58:39.193 --> 58:41.529
Is that a yes or a no?

58:42.430 --> 58:43.431
Yes.

58:44.565 --> 58:47.868
But I want busts, Agent Bates.

58:49.504 --> 58:53.406

Congratulations, my friend.

About what?

59:56.872 --> 59:58.972
You just broke the record.

59:58.974 --> 01:00:00.073
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:00:00.075 --> 01:00:02.643

Oh, my God.

Okay.

01:00:06.281 --> 01:00:08.483
The main boss
is really happy about this.

01:00:08.485 --> 01:00:10.283
- Yeah. Good.
- He wants to meet you.

01:00:10.285 --> 01:00:12.221
- Does he? Does he? Okay.
- Yeah.

01:00:37.815 --> 01:00:38.980
Beautiful.

01:00:49.993 --> 01:00:51.058
<i>Hola, papi.</i>

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.060
Hi, gals. Wow.

01:00:53.062 --> 01:00:54.830
- Laton.
- Oh.

01:00:54.832 --> 01:00:56.032
Ah.

01:00:57.835 --> 01:00:59.268
Welcome to Mexico,
Mr. Stone.

01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:01.503
Hi, Mr. Laton.
Yes, how are you?

01:01:01.505 --> 01:01:03.505
Who do you have to kill
to get a place like this?

01:01:03.507 --> 01:01:04.840
Oh, many, many people.

01:01:04.842 --> 01:01:06.040
I mean, it's really beautiful.

01:01:06.042 --> 01:01:07.576
- Thank you.
- My, my.

01:01:07.578 --> 01:01:10.112
What's your pleasure?

01:01:10.114 --> 01:01:11.280
What would you like?

01:01:11.282 --> 01:01:12.514
I'll have a double.

01:01:15.686 --> 01:01:17.052
How was the flight? Good?

01:01:17.054 --> 01:01:18.287
Uh, you know,
it was really good.

01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:19.788
Really good. A little bumpy.

01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:21.223
Thank you.
But not too bad.

01:01:21.225 --> 01:01:24.059
- Let me show you around.
- It was good.

01:01:41.646 --> 01:01:44.313
Don't hurt yourself.

01:02:27.092 --> 01:02:29.560
Earl, I want to
introduce you to somebody.

01:02:29.562 --> 01:02:31.697
Okay.

01:02:33.699 --> 01:02:35.133
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:02:37.336 --> 01:02:40.036
Thank you. Thank you, too.

01:02:40.038 --> 01:02:42.406
I want you to take good care
of Earl tonight, okay?

01:02:42.408 --> 01:02:45.576
Tuck him in and stay with him.
Make him feel good.

01:02:45.578 --> 01:02:47.146
Of course.

01:02:51.952 --> 01:02:53.786
Don't hurt yourself, <i>Tata.</i>

01:02:55.054 --> 01:02:56.389
I won't.

01:03:13.139 --> 01:03:14.305
Ah...

01:03:14.307 --> 01:03:16.373
- Ah, this is...
- Lay down.

01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:18.175
- Beautiful.
- Oh, yeah.

01:03:18.177 --> 01:03:20.378
- Yeah.
- Do you like it?

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.382
Huh?

01:03:28.689 --> 01:03:30.989
I love it. Oh, God.

01:03:32.359 --> 01:03:34.192
Sweetheart.

01:03:37.164 --> 01:03:39.666
Wow. What do we have here?

01:03:40.534 --> 01:03:42.200
Oh! You guys having some fun?

01:03:42.202 --> 01:03:47.006
Well, we were just relaxing
a little bit. It was nothing.

01:03:47.008 --> 01:03:48.573
I think we'd rather have fun.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:51.777
I think that a little heart
medicine wouldn't hurt.

01:03:51.779 --> 01:03:55.480
You're fine. Here, let me grab
these lights for you.

01:03:55.482 --> 01:03:58.416
- One light will do.
- Yeah, get comfy.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:00.251
I need to call
a cardiologist.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:01.656
Doctor Clark.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.335
Hey!
Mr. Life Of The Party.

01:04:16.337 --> 01:04:17.737
- Yeah.
- You having fun?

01:04:17.739 --> 01:04:19.705
- Yeah, I am.
- Yeah, you are.

01:04:19.707 --> 01:04:22.008
- I saw you.
- I was having fun all right.

01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:23.476
I've been looking for you.

01:04:23.478 --> 01:04:24.977
- For me?
- I was looking for you.

01:04:24.979 --> 01:04:26.345
Oh, yeah?

01:04:26.347 --> 01:04:28.247
Yeah, I thought I'd give you
a little advice.

01:04:28.249 --> 01:04:29.983
You're...
You're giving me advice?

01:04:29.985 --> 01:04:31.084
Yeah. Yeah. I...

01:04:31.086 --> 01:04:32.218
I pass.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.655
I think you ought to quit.

01:04:35.189 --> 01:04:36.790
Quit? Quit what?

01:04:36.792 --> 01:04:38.157
Quit this.

01:04:38.159 --> 01:04:41.527
Quit here. These people
don't give a crap about you.

01:04:41.529 --> 01:04:42.829
You know, you could quit,

01:04:42.831 --> 01:04:44.530
find something
you really love to do.

01:04:44.532 --> 01:04:45.999
And then go after it.

01:04:46.001 --> 01:04:49.102
Wait, wait, wait,
what are you talking about?

01:04:49.104 --> 01:04:51.104
Let me tell you
something, okay?

01:04:51.106 --> 01:04:52.572
This is my family.
This is my home.

01:04:52.574 --> 01:04:54.541
- Yeah.
- Okay? Laton...

01:04:54.543 --> 01:04:58.045
He pulled me from the streets.
I was nobody. I was nothing.

01:04:58.047 --> 01:05:01.314
Okay? He gave me everything.
And here, I'm somebody.

01:05:01.316 --> 01:05:02.616
Yeah.

01:05:02.618 --> 01:05:05.786
Yeah. So what are you
talking about?

01:05:05.788 --> 01:05:07.354
Well...

01:05:07.356 --> 01:05:10.058
Hell, just an idea, you know?

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.392
Earl, Earl. Wait. No, no.
Where are you going?

01:05:12.394 --> 01:05:15.829
Hey, I'm gonna go
up to my room.

01:05:15.831 --> 01:05:17.633
There I'm somebody.

01:05:19.903 --> 01:05:21.768
No one wants
to tip off the cartel,

01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:23.805
but we have to show some kind
of progress with this case.

01:05:23.807 --> 01:05:25.942
But you're talking about
a PR stunt.

01:05:28.745 --> 01:05:31.179
In Arlington, there's a table
of administrators

01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.181
sitting around just like us,

01:05:33.183 --> 01:05:36.150
only they're wondering
what the hell we're doing,

01:05:36.152 --> 01:05:38.555
and if maybe someone else
wouldn't be more productive.

01:05:39.155 --> 01:05:40.387
Hmm.

01:05:40.389 --> 01:05:42.525
We need busts,
Agent Bates.

01:05:45.995 --> 01:05:47.729
Well, there's an alleged,
uh, stash house

01:05:47.731 --> 01:05:48.996
that might be getting
a shipment

01:05:48.998 --> 01:05:50.064
in the next couple of days.

01:05:50.066 --> 01:05:51.365
That's more like it.

01:05:51.367 --> 01:05:52.600
- Possible busts.
- Good.

01:05:52.602 --> 01:05:54.771
Have to look like
local PD, though.

01:05:55.505 --> 01:05:57.106
To the cartel.

01:05:57.108 --> 01:05:59.776
Our report will reflect
it's from our operation.

01:06:02.412 --> 01:06:05.281
Do it. But I want busts.

01:06:09.252 --> 01:06:10.718
You heard the man.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.822
It's tricky.

01:06:12.522 --> 01:06:14.257
Splish-splash.

01:06:15.926 --> 01:06:17.258
Any last minute orders?

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:20.963
Yeah. Nobody shoot me,
unless absolutely necessary.

01:06:20.965 --> 01:06:23.932
Nah, it's your show, Captain.
We're just tourists here.

01:06:23.934 --> 01:06:25.801
All right, gentlemen,
you heard the man.

01:06:25.803 --> 01:06:28.304
Business as usual.
Weapons hot.

01:06:29.206 --> 01:06:30.506
Police!

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:34.076
Get down!

01:06:37.381 --> 01:06:39.081
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:40.351
Get down!

01:06:40.985 --> 01:06:42.887
Move! Stay down!

01:06:50.195 --> 01:06:52.929
Get down! Get down!
Get on the ground!

01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:54.429
Don't even think about it.

01:06:54.431 --> 01:06:55.831
Don't move!

01:06:55.833 --> 01:06:57.967
Five of these.

01:06:57.969 --> 01:07:00.003
We got
what they wanted, I suppose.

01:07:00.005 --> 01:07:01.503
Yeah. Two nobody illegals

01:07:01.505 --> 01:07:03.273
and a few bags of coke
to lay out for the press.

01:07:03.275 --> 01:07:04.841
Guess now I can retire.

01:07:14.553 --> 01:07:16.686
<i>Glam Cosmetology welcomes</i>

01:07:16.688 --> 01:07:19.222
<i>the friends and family
of our graduates.</i>

01:07:19.224 --> 01:07:22.192
<i>Thank you so much

01:07:22.194 --> 01:07:26.162
<i>to honor these lovely young

<i>who are following

01:07:28.533 --> 01:07:31.835
<i>We are so proud
of our graduates.</i>

01:07:31.837 --> 01:07:34.573
You're a glutton
for punishment.

01:07:35.841 --> 01:07:36.940
No.

01:07:36.942 --> 01:07:39.642
I'll have you know
I was invited.

01:07:39.644 --> 01:07:41.045
<i>And now
they are moving on</i>

01:07:41.047 --> 01:07:42.779
<i>to the next chapter
of their lives.</i>

01:07:42.781 --> 01:07:45.316
<i>Tonight, you are barbers,
hair designers...</i>

01:07:45.318 --> 01:07:48.052
What are you wearing?

01:07:48.054 --> 01:07:50.455
It's just a gold bracelet.

01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:52.189
You like it?

01:07:52.191 --> 01:07:53.423
<i>We all need
to take a pause</i>

01:07:53.425 --> 01:07:54.861
<i>and savor this day.</i>

01:07:55.595 --> 01:07:57.161
<i>Reflect on the journey,</i>

01:07:57.163 --> 01:07:59.864
<i>the challenges,
and the obstacles...</i>

01:07:59.866 --> 01:08:02.032
What are you doing here?

01:08:02.034 --> 01:08:05.002
I'm just trying to make up
for lost time.

01:08:05.004 --> 01:08:08.774
And, uh, I do feel that
education is important.

01:08:12.478 --> 01:08:14.845
Well, thank God
she finally scrounged up

01:08:14.847 --> 01:08:16.913
enough money to finish school.

01:08:16.916 --> 01:08:18.584
Yeah. Thank God.

01:08:21.854 --> 01:08:24.657
You? Impossible.

01:08:31.131 --> 01:08:32.796
What's the matter? You okay?

01:08:32.798 --> 01:08:35.466
It's nothing, it's nothing.
It comes and goes.

01:08:35.468 --> 01:08:36.801
- It's nothing.
- All right.

01:08:36.803 --> 01:08:39.371
No worries, no worries.
I'm fine.

01:08:39.372 --> 01:08:41.206
I'm fine.

01:08:41.207 --> 01:08:42.575
- All right.
- I'm fine.

01:08:50.317 --> 01:08:51.383
Pull!

01:09:05.631 --> 01:09:07.133
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:09:09.703 --> 01:09:11.505
Pull!

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:51.511
Gustavo.

01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:56.316
Laton is gone.

01:09:56.318 --> 01:09:58.118
He was getting too lenient.

01:10:03.891 --> 01:10:05.558
The DEA is cracking down,

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.726
and I'm not gonna
rot in prison

01:10:06.728 --> 01:10:08.130
because of his deficiencies.

01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:11.266
So, I got rid of him.

01:10:13.068 --> 01:10:14.803
It's my show now.

01:10:20.009 --> 01:10:21.110
Hmm.

01:10:22.277 --> 01:10:23.846
No more tardiness.

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:26.813
No more going off radar.

01:10:26.815 --> 01:10:28.915
Everything goes
according to plan.

01:10:28.917 --> 01:10:31.651
No deviations, no excuses.

01:10:31.653 --> 01:10:33.653
Everybody gets
with the program,

01:10:33.655 --> 01:10:34.855
or they go away.

01:10:34.857 --> 01:10:37.791
I don't care who it is.

01:10:37.793 --> 01:10:41.164
And yes, this goes
for your gringo, too.

01:10:42.798 --> 01:10:44.633
You have a problem with that?

01:10:46.236 --> 01:10:47.237
No.

01:11:06.923 --> 01:11:08.222
Here's your burger.

01:11:08.224 --> 01:11:10.860
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:11:31.449 --> 01:11:33.549
Change of plans, <i>viejo.</i>

01:11:33.551 --> 01:11:35.119
You follow us.

01:12:06.518 --> 01:12:07.852
Where are we going?

01:12:26.637 --> 01:12:28.006
Get out.

01:12:47.527 --> 01:12:49.728
It's so quiet out here.

01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:55.767
No one for miles.

01:13:00.238 --> 01:13:03.706
I want you to
listen carefully, <i>viejo.</i>

01:13:03.708 --> 01:13:06.042
There's new rules.

01:13:06.044 --> 01:13:09.413
You show up on time.
You leave on time.

01:13:09.415 --> 01:13:13.350
No unscheduled stops.
No fucking bullshit, man.

01:13:13.352 --> 01:13:16.389
All orders are to be
followed to the letter.

01:13:26.098 --> 01:13:28.301
We have a gift for you.

01:13:44.784 --> 01:13:46.085
Sal.

01:13:51.525 --> 01:13:54.259
Go. Open, <i>viejo.</i>

01:13:54.261 --> 01:13:57.295
It's a phone for you.
This one you keep.

01:13:57.297 --> 01:13:59.964
You keep it on you
at all times.

01:13:59.966 --> 01:14:02.334
That's someone
who didn't follow orders.

01:14:05.738 --> 01:14:09.209
So you know the routes.

01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:12.412
We're not gonna babysit you,

01:14:13.247 --> 01:14:15.580
but we have eyes everywhere.

01:14:15.582 --> 01:14:17.683
We're only warning you once.

01:14:17.685 --> 01:14:19.818
No more late shit, Earl.

01:14:21.088 --> 01:14:22.320
New boss says,

01:14:22.322 --> 01:14:23.723
you show up late again
and you're done.

01:14:26.661 --> 01:14:29.395
We own your ass, <i>cabron,</i>

01:14:29.397 --> 01:14:31.164
so don't be stupid,

01:14:32.032 --> 01:14:33.867
or you disappear.

01:14:37.572 --> 01:14:39.338
<i>Si.</i>

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:40.972
Answer that phone.

01:14:40.974 --> 01:14:42.876
You do as you're told.

01:14:43.578 --> 01:14:44.976
Don't be a problem.

01:14:44.978 --> 01:14:46.312
That's what happens
when you're a problem.

01:14:46.314 --> 01:14:48.247
You end up
in the goddamn trunk.

01:14:48.249 --> 01:14:51.286
- Julio, <i>mijo...</i>
- No, no, don't "Julio" me.

01:14:52.687 --> 01:14:54.088
We're not friends.

01:14:55.857 --> 01:14:57.425
I'm not your <i>mijo.</i>

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:51.078
- <i>Orale,</i> Earl. You're back.
- Yeah.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.212
What's up, big poppa?

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:54.514
Yeah, it's me.

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:57.184
And I gather
you guys own my ass.

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:59.319
Oh, come on, man.
It's not that bad.

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:01.357
Ready for another trip,
<i>una mas?</i>

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:04.157
Okay. All right.

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:06.360
Come on, <i>viejito.</i>
Let's make some money.

01:16:06.362 --> 01:16:07.994
All right.

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:09.162
That's the spirit.

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:10.832
Yeah, that's the Earl I know.

01:16:10.834 --> 01:16:13.301
Yeah!

01:16:13.303 --> 01:16:14.769
- What did he give us?
- Nothing.

01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:15.936
But from the wiretap,

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:16.970
we know where
the mule's going.

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:18.506
We know his exact route.

01:16:18.508 --> 01:16:20.541
So this time, we don't use
local PD or state troopers.

01:16:20.543 --> 01:16:22.610
It's Agent Trevino and myself
in an undercover vehicle,

01:16:22.612 --> 01:16:25.081
Agent Brown
in an unmarked making stops.

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.648
- An aircraft.
- And?

01:16:27.650 --> 01:16:31.219
And that's it. We pull
the plug on the whole thing.

01:16:31.221 --> 01:16:32.787
All the surveillance,
all the wiretapping,

01:16:32.789 --> 01:16:34.823
man-hours, everything,
it all comes to a head.

01:16:34.825 --> 01:16:36.124
It's a lot of busts.

01:16:36.126 --> 01:16:38.128
- Go get 'er done.
- Okay.

01:16:48.037 --> 01:16:49.673
All right,
let's see what we got.

01:17:04.388 --> 01:17:06.121
They look funny.

01:17:06.123 --> 01:17:07.656
Nah, between the two of them,

01:17:07.658 --> 01:17:10.327
they got no more than three
grams of coke, guaranteed.

01:17:16.634 --> 01:17:18.202
Brown, you see this?

01:17:26.277 --> 01:17:28.678
Yeah, let's pull him over.

01:17:47.097 --> 01:17:50.165
I'm slowly exiting
my vehicle.

01:17:50.167 --> 01:17:51.703
- How you doing?
- I'm not a threat, sir.

01:17:53.438 --> 01:17:54.938
- Please don't shoot me.
- All right.

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.439
Please don't shoot me.

01:17:56.441 --> 01:17:57.941
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm complying.

01:17:57.943 --> 01:17:59.576
Relax. Relax.
Put your hands on the hood.

01:17:59.578 --> 01:18:01.244
- My hands are on the vehicle.
- Great.

01:18:01.246 --> 01:18:02.512
You don't have any weapons
on you, do you, man?

01:18:02.514 --> 01:18:03.780
- No, sir, no weapons.
- All right.

01:18:03.782 --> 01:18:05.081
I'm very tense right now.

01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:07.383
Do you have
any drugs in the car?

01:18:07.385 --> 01:18:09.820
No drugs. Not high,
don't have any drugs,

01:18:09.822 --> 01:18:10.955
never had any drugs.

01:18:10.957 --> 01:18:12.655
Okay. All right.

01:18:12.657 --> 01:18:14.324
You know,
statistically speaking,

01:18:14.326 --> 01:18:16.961
this is the most dangerous
five minutes of my life.

01:18:16.963 --> 01:18:19.630
Being pulled over
by law enforcement.

01:18:19.632 --> 01:18:22.332
It's okay.
Take it easy. Just breathe.

01:18:22.334 --> 01:18:24.869
You want me to breathe?
You want me to relax?

01:18:24.871 --> 01:18:27.370
The chances of me dying
during a routine traffic stop

01:18:27.372 --> 01:18:29.475
are greater than...
I don't even know.

01:18:32.778 --> 01:18:34.478
It's the most dangerous
five minutes of my life, man,

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.112
being pulled over
by law enforcement.

01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:39.452
I don't speak Spanish.

01:18:40.286 --> 01:18:41.752
I... I'm no threat.

01:18:41.754 --> 01:18:44.020
That's you?

01:18:44.022 --> 01:18:46.125
- Car is clean.
- Okay.

01:18:47.627 --> 01:18:50.029
Sorry to inconvenience you.
Have a good day, sir.

01:18:53.599 --> 01:18:56.200
Thank you
for your service, Officer.

01:18:56.202 --> 01:18:57.703
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:19:00.273 --> 01:19:02.041
Have a good day.

01:19:22.429 --> 01:19:26.765
<i>♪ And on that road again</i>

01:19:26.767 --> 01:19:29.668
<i>♪ On the road again</i>

01:19:29.670 --> 01:19:33.638
<i>♪ That's me
I'm on that road again ♪</i>

01:19:46.086 --> 01:19:48.119
How we looking up there,
anything?

01:19:48.121 --> 01:19:50.723
<i>No.
I got no more, man.</i>

01:19:50.725 --> 01:19:52.794
Yeah, he's not here.

01:19:54.796 --> 01:19:56.396
Hey, Luis.

01:19:57.497 --> 01:19:59.699
You don't have him, do you?

01:19:59.701 --> 01:20:01.166
No. Why?

01:20:01.168 --> 01:20:04.102
<i>He'll be at the Honest Abe
Motel off Interstate 55.</i>

01:20:04.104 --> 01:20:05.438
Well, that's rather specific.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.339
Tata <i>had to get permission</i>

01:20:07.341 --> 01:20:09.976
from his handler
to stop for the night.

01:20:09.978 --> 01:20:11.877
<i>Does that prove my worth?</i>

01:20:11.879 --> 01:20:13.213
We'll see.

01:20:16.851 --> 01:20:19.687
Says he's got a location
on him, Honest Abe Motel.

01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:23.424
Let's check it out.

01:20:31.967 --> 01:20:33.332
It would work a lot better

01:20:33.334 --> 01:20:34.669
if you get that damn phone
out of your hand.

01:20:36.805 --> 01:20:39.207
Did I ask for your
fucking advice, grandpa?

01:20:44.312 --> 01:20:46.514
Past your fucking
bedtime anyway.

01:20:51.152 --> 01:20:53.487
All right, scratch 109.
That's just a young couple

01:20:53.489 --> 01:20:55.489
- with kids and a toddler.
- All right.

01:20:55.491 --> 01:20:56.492
No.

01:20:59.828 --> 01:21:03.399
We got a possible in 203.
Solo male, mid-30s.

01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:13.041
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
What's that, right there?

01:21:13.043 --> 01:21:14.243
What's that, right there?

01:21:15.078 --> 01:21:16.812
You think that's our guy?

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:19.981
Could be.

01:21:19.983 --> 01:21:21.615
How do you wanna play it?

01:21:21.617 --> 01:21:24.284
You wanna get local
police here on a noise call?

01:21:24.286 --> 01:21:25.853
Disorderly conduct?

01:21:25.855 --> 01:21:28.825
No, let's just have homeboy
run into the wrong guy.

01:21:35.799 --> 01:21:37.832
- Everything all right?
- Yeah,

01:21:37.834 --> 01:21:40.267
except I'm trying to avoid
some big asshole

01:21:40.269 --> 01:21:41.836
who's going around here

01:21:41.838 --> 01:21:44.906
banging his cell phone
on the ice machine down there.

01:21:44.908 --> 01:21:47.675
I don't know what it is with
you guys and your generation.

01:21:47.677 --> 01:21:48.776
"You guys"?

01:21:48.778 --> 01:21:50.878
Jesus.
Don't you guys live life

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.047
for something outside
the goddamn phone?

01:22:14.038 --> 01:22:15.236
The fuck are you doing?

01:22:15.238 --> 01:22:17.072
Fuck, I thought
this was my room.

01:22:17.074 --> 01:22:20.441
Yeah? Well, it's not.
Wake the fuck up, asshole.

01:22:20.443 --> 01:22:22.012
Oh, fuck you, bro.

01:22:23.948 --> 01:22:25.080
What did you say to me?

01:22:25.082 --> 01:22:26.650
I said, "Fuck you."

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:37.893
I don't know
if you've heard the news,

01:22:37.895 --> 01:22:39.495
but it's a felony
to assault a DEA Agent.

01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:41.530
- A what?
- DEA Agent.

01:22:41.532 --> 01:22:43.267
Fuck.

01:22:44.202 --> 01:22:46.335
Yeah, it's less than an ounce.

01:22:46.337 --> 01:22:48.272
Maybe 15 grams.

01:22:50.041 --> 01:22:51.575
See what's in his pickup.

01:22:57.615 --> 01:23:00.315
Ah, fuck. It's not him.

01:23:00.317 --> 01:23:04.187
Maybe there's another Honest
Abe Motel or maybe it's code?

01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:05.621
What do you wanna
do with this guy?

01:23:05.623 --> 01:23:07.090
Uh, call local PD,

01:23:07.092 --> 01:23:09.025
give them the half-ounce
of meth and we keep going.

01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:11.360
Start back up at 6:00 a.m.
Get some rest.

01:23:11.362 --> 01:23:12.597
Come on.

01:23:22.707 --> 01:23:24.275
- Miss?
- Hi.

01:23:24.277 --> 01:23:25.642
Yeah, I'll have
a cup of coffee

01:23:25.644 --> 01:23:27.278
and maybe you'd fill
that thermos for me?

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.745
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

01:23:28.747 --> 01:23:30.281
Can I get the, uh, check,
when you get the chance?

01:23:30.283 --> 01:23:31.550
Absolutely.

01:23:51.037 --> 01:23:52.104
Morning.

01:23:53.873 --> 01:23:54.874
Morning.

01:23:56.474 --> 01:23:59.076
Oh, shit. It's the fifth.

01:23:59.078 --> 01:24:00.079
Hmm.

01:24:00.713 --> 01:24:01.914
Oh, shit.

01:24:03.249 --> 01:24:05.950
I know a lot
about "oh, shits."

01:24:05.952 --> 01:24:10.656
Is that a missed birthday
or what?

01:24:11.490 --> 01:24:12.892
Anniversary.

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.760
Jesus, I'm an idiot.

01:24:16.762 --> 01:24:18.028
Yeah.

01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:20.332
Yeah, I am.

01:24:20.334 --> 01:24:21.866
Sure.

01:24:21.868 --> 01:24:24.236
Yeah, you know, she doesn't
say, "Happy anniversary."

01:24:24.238 --> 01:24:29.840
Just let it sit out there,
waiting for me to remember.

01:24:29.842 --> 01:24:32.409
That was really
something yesterday,

01:24:32.411 --> 01:24:34.678
down at the motel.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.582
The way you took
that guy down.

01:24:37.818 --> 01:24:39.583
That was something else,
I tell you.

01:24:39.585 --> 01:24:40.919
Sorry if we caused you
any disturbance.

01:24:40.921 --> 01:24:42.453
No, no. It didn't disturb me.
It was...

01:24:42.455 --> 01:24:43.857
That was unfortunate.

01:24:48.962 --> 01:24:50.462
Well...

01:24:50.464 --> 01:24:52.030
You gotta think
about the family.

01:24:52.032 --> 01:24:52.898
Ah, yeah.

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:55.500
Each anniversary's important.

01:24:55.502 --> 01:24:57.535
But you've got to think
about it because

01:24:57.537 --> 01:24:59.539
women love that shit,
you know?

01:25:03.644 --> 01:25:06.312
But, you know, I'm the king
of missing anniversaries.

01:25:06.314 --> 01:25:07.714
- Oh, yeah?
- That's the problem. Yes.

01:25:09.117 --> 01:25:11.451
Well, it's the first one
I've missed, so...

01:25:12.086 --> 01:25:13.185
Good luck.

01:25:13.187 --> 01:25:15.720
Don't follow my footsteps
and do what I did.

01:25:15.722 --> 01:25:18.823
I put work in front of family.

01:25:18.825 --> 01:25:21.060
Family's the most
important thing.

01:25:21.062 --> 01:25:23.963
Work's fine,
if it's in second position.

01:25:23.965 --> 01:25:26.365
But first position
should be family.

01:25:26.367 --> 01:25:27.934
I've learned that
the hard way.

01:25:27.936 --> 01:25:30.136
My daughter
won't even speak to me.

01:25:30.138 --> 01:25:32.640
Haven't talked to
in 12 and a half years.

01:25:33.207 --> 01:25:34.542
Jesus.

01:25:35.410 --> 01:25:36.945
Twelve and a half years.

01:25:38.413 --> 01:25:39.979
It's like I never...

01:25:39.981 --> 01:25:42.382
Like they were never there,
or something.

01:25:46.322 --> 01:25:48.187
But, uh, anyway,

01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:50.257
- I'd better pay you.
- Oh, thank you.

01:25:50.259 --> 01:25:51.757
Here, you keep that.

01:25:51.759 --> 01:25:54.060
- Thank you.
- That's fine.

01:25:54.062 --> 01:25:55.828
Just what you needed,

01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:57.596
some asshole sitting here,
telling you about

01:25:57.598 --> 01:25:59.299
what you should do
in your personal life.

01:25:59.301 --> 01:26:00.933
No, not at all.

01:26:00.935 --> 01:26:04.404
Anyway, I want to
wish you good luck.

01:26:04.406 --> 01:26:06.139
You'll need it.

01:26:06.141 --> 01:26:07.941
And, uh, thank you
for the advice.

01:26:07.943 --> 01:26:10.377
It's good to talk to one
of you guys, once in a while.

01:26:10.379 --> 01:26:12.245
- "You guys"?
- You know.

01:26:12.247 --> 01:26:14.081
- What kind of guys?
- You're just willing to...

01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:15.782
You know,
you've lived so long,

01:26:15.784 --> 01:26:17.618
I think you've probably
lost your filter.

01:26:21.190 --> 01:26:24.558
Really. I never realized
I ever had one.

01:26:26.729 --> 01:26:29.732
- All right. Take it easy.
- You, too.

01:26:45.281 --> 01:26:47.117
Excuse me, sir.

01:26:53.023 --> 01:26:54.057
Forgot this.

01:26:55.492 --> 01:26:56.556
Oh.

01:26:56.558 --> 01:26:58.326
Thank you very much.

01:26:58.328 --> 01:27:00.030
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

01:27:20.717 --> 01:27:22.418
Hello, Ginny.

01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:24.218
<i>Grandpa Earl,</i>

01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:25.887
<i>it's Grandma Mary.</i>

01:27:25.889 --> 01:27:30.159
She's sick. Like, sick sick.
We're at the hospital,

01:27:30.161 --> 01:27:32.261
<i>but they're sending her home.</i>

01:27:32.263 --> 01:27:33.661
Oh, well, that's good.

01:27:33.663 --> 01:27:35.531
That's good
that they're sending her home.

01:27:35.533 --> 01:27:37.698
No, it's bad.

01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.668
They did all these
tests and scan shit,

01:27:40.670 --> 01:27:41.803
but it doesn't matter.

01:27:41.805 --> 01:27:43.272
They said she should've...

01:27:43.274 --> 01:27:45.342
She should've come in,
like, a year ago.

01:27:47.577 --> 01:27:49.378
<i>Grandpa Earl, are you there?</i>

01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:50.779
Yeah.

01:27:50.781 --> 01:27:53.415
<i>You have to come,
like, right now.</i>

01:27:53.417 --> 01:27:55.217
Ginny, I can't.

01:27:55.219 --> 01:27:58.020
What? Why?

01:27:58.022 --> 01:28:00.656
<i>They said it could be
any day now.</i>

01:28:00.658 --> 01:28:03.092
I've got this schedule.
It's really tight.

01:28:04.463 --> 01:28:05.694
<i>I've just got so many things.
I can't do it.</i>

01:28:05.696 --> 01:28:07.796
Yeah, right.

01:28:07.798 --> 01:28:09.131
<i>I took shit for years,</i>

01:28:09.133 --> 01:28:11.733
sticking up for you.
What an idiot!

01:28:11.735 --> 01:28:14.339
It turns out,
I was wrong the whole time.

01:28:15.639 --> 01:28:17.773
Ginny...

01:28:17.775 --> 01:28:20.709
I'm sorry.
If I could drop everything

01:28:20.711 --> 01:28:23.848
<i>and go do it, I would.
But I'm sorry...</i>

01:28:57.883 --> 01:29:00.817
- You came?
- Yeah.

01:29:00.819 --> 01:29:02.952
Where's your mom?

01:29:02.954 --> 01:29:05.322
She's in her bedroom.

01:29:05.324 --> 01:29:07.226
Okay. I'm gonna go in.

01:29:19.138 --> 01:29:20.406
Hello, Mary.

01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:25.745
Earl,

01:29:26.546 --> 01:29:28.112
what do you want?

01:29:28.114 --> 01:29:31.115
You're not in the will
or anything.

01:29:31.117 --> 01:29:32.118
Oh.

01:29:35.221 --> 01:29:37.323
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:29:38.724 --> 01:29:41.759
I didn't mean to say that.

01:29:41.761 --> 01:29:44.130
I'm just scared, is all.

01:29:44.697 --> 01:29:46.298
Yeah.

01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.799
Well, the only person
who wants to live to 100

01:29:48.801 --> 01:29:51.405
is a 99-year-old, anyway.

01:29:52.472 --> 01:29:54.341
I'm sorry, Mary.

01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:58.945
I'm... I'm sorry
for everything.

01:30:02.249 --> 01:30:05.018
You lived
to get back out there.

01:30:06.386 --> 01:30:09.621
All the conventions

01:30:09.623 --> 01:30:15.193
and the socializing and being
the center of attention.

01:30:15.195 --> 01:30:20.000
They got the fun,
wonderful man that you are.

01:30:20.934 --> 01:30:22.367
And we got the Earl

01:30:22.369 --> 01:30:25.405
who just couldn't wait
to get back out there.

01:30:27.274 --> 01:30:28.443
Yeah.

01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:30.809
Well, you're right.

01:30:30.811 --> 01:30:32.345
I thought it was
more important

01:30:32.347 --> 01:30:35.350
to be somebody out there

01:30:37.017 --> 01:30:40.355
than the damn failure I was
here at my own home.

01:30:45.792 --> 01:30:47.328
Anyway, for what it's worth,

01:30:48.895 --> 01:30:50.465
I'm here now.

01:30:53.434 --> 01:30:55.236
I don't know why,

01:30:56.704 --> 01:30:58.473
but for some reason,

01:31:01.042 --> 01:31:03.478
I'm so glad you're here.

01:31:10.451 --> 01:31:11.553
Yeah.

01:31:12.554 --> 01:31:14.055
Thank you.

01:31:30.773 --> 01:31:33.075
No answer, again.

01:31:33.941 --> 01:31:36.876
No good, Earl. No good.

01:31:36.878 --> 01:31:39.948
We're going to end
that fucking <i>Tata.</i>

01:31:45.988 --> 01:31:48.357
Was supposed to be here
a day ago.

01:31:49.692 --> 01:31:51.593
Maybe the kid lied.

01:31:56.899 --> 01:31:58.300
Maybe.

01:32:00.704 --> 01:32:04.171
Hang on, there's
a call coming from inside.

01:32:04.173 --> 01:32:06.275
They don't know
where he is either.

01:32:06.942 --> 01:32:08.478
They sound pissed.

01:32:10.045 --> 01:32:12.014
Say when they find him,

01:32:12.782 --> 01:32:14.384
they're gonna kill him.

01:32:26.895 --> 01:32:28.129
Mmm.

01:32:32.802 --> 01:32:34.604
- You all right?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:32:35.605 --> 01:32:38.041
Mmm. Good.

01:32:40.778 --> 01:32:43.213
Earl.

01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.582
Tell me something?

01:32:46.584 --> 01:32:48.084
Yeah, anything.

01:32:49.986 --> 01:32:52.956
How did you come into
all that money?

01:32:57.561 --> 01:32:59.294
Well, I just...

01:32:59.296 --> 01:33:01.296
Well, I'm not gonna
lie to you.

01:33:01.298 --> 01:33:03.532
I'm a high-end gigolo.

01:33:07.772 --> 01:33:09.805
- Bounty hunter?
- Come on.

01:33:09.807 --> 01:33:11.407
Seriously, come on.

01:33:11.409 --> 01:33:13.308
- All right, seriously.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:16.645
I've become a drug mule
for the cartel.

01:33:16.647 --> 01:33:20.048
And I've got
305 kilos of cocaine

01:33:20.050 --> 01:33:22.319
sitting right in the back
of my truck out there.

01:33:27.958 --> 01:33:30.561
You're never gonna tell me.

01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:37.232
Well, whatever you did,

01:33:37.234 --> 01:33:41.372
you didn't have to get rich
for us to want you around.

01:33:45.009 --> 01:33:46.378
Yeah.

01:34:03.028 --> 01:34:05.697
I see you finally
came out here.

01:34:11.303 --> 01:34:14.604
See, she didn't completely
throw you away.

01:34:14.606 --> 01:34:16.041
No.

01:34:18.109 --> 01:34:21.044
I failed you, Iris.

01:34:21.046 --> 01:34:26.216
I was a terrible father,
terrible husband.

01:34:26.218 --> 01:34:28.519
I just blew it, that's all.

01:34:28.521 --> 01:34:30.188
Blew my chance.

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:36.494
I don't think so.

01:34:36.496 --> 01:34:38.829
I think you're just
a late bloomer.

01:34:40.867 --> 01:34:42.568
Yeah.

01:34:47.607 --> 01:34:48.839
They're shitting bricks.

01:34:48.841 --> 01:34:51.041
They haven't heard from him
in over a week.

01:34:51.043 --> 01:34:53.577
And it's like 12 mil
worth of coke,

01:34:53.579 --> 01:34:56.516
so, I mean, they got people
swarming the highways.

01:34:57.583 --> 01:34:59.018
Good.

01:35:03.122 --> 01:35:04.756
We have new information
on <i>Tata.</i>

01:35:04.758 --> 01:35:07.391
I have new information,
from my boss.

01:35:07.393 --> 01:35:09.628
- It's time to wrap this up.
- Come on, we can get this guy.

01:35:09.630 --> 01:35:12.564
- Oh, it's been months, Colin.
- So what's a couple more days?

01:35:12.566 --> 01:35:14.331
Look, we don't even know
if the guy is still out there.

01:35:14.333 --> 01:35:16.233
You've been allotted
as much time and resources

01:35:16.235 --> 01:35:18.603
as we can give to anyone.

01:35:18.605 --> 01:35:20.440
You did good work.

01:35:24.778 --> 01:35:27.546
If you had a few more days
while we finalize

01:35:27.548 --> 01:35:29.381
the warrants,
what's your plan?

01:35:29.383 --> 01:35:30.849
Follow his followers.

01:35:30.851 --> 01:35:32.884
We tapped the phones
of a couple cartel guys

01:35:32.886 --> 01:35:34.187
that are also looking for him.

01:35:34.988 --> 01:35:36.955
Okay, do it.

01:35:36.957 --> 01:35:38.258
Thank you.

01:36:14.929 --> 01:36:17.165
What? You okay?

01:36:19.834 --> 01:36:21.536
It's all right.

01:36:28.376 --> 01:36:33.412
You were the love of my life

01:36:33.414 --> 01:36:36.718
and the pain of my life.

01:36:39.487 --> 01:36:44.392
I need you to know,

01:36:47.029 --> 01:36:50.196
it's all the world to me

01:36:50.198 --> 01:36:52.468
that you're here.

01:37:01.175 --> 01:37:02.778
I love you, Mary.

01:37:06.248 --> 01:37:09.218
More today than yesterday?

01:37:13.322 --> 01:37:15.557
But not as much as tomorrow.

01:37:18.627 --> 01:37:20.830
Oh. Oh.

01:37:39.214 --> 01:37:41.049
I knew Mary
well enough to know

01:37:41.051 --> 01:37:43.151
that there was
no better friend,

01:37:43.153 --> 01:37:45.386
no better mother,
no better mentor.

01:37:45.388 --> 01:37:47.757
No better listener
to those in need.

01:37:48.925 --> 01:37:50.625
The light that
she carried through

01:37:50.627 --> 01:37:52.760
in her soul and her spirit

01:37:52.762 --> 01:37:55.263
is something that
we should carry on

01:37:55.265 --> 01:37:57.031
in our own daily lives.

01:37:57.033 --> 01:37:59.168
The optimism, the hopefulness,

01:37:59.170 --> 01:38:02.670
even at the end of her days.

01:38:02.672 --> 01:38:04.973
"Everything works out
better than expected,"

01:38:04.975 --> 01:38:06.407
she always used to say.

01:38:06.409 --> 01:38:07.809
We will miss her,

01:38:07.811 --> 01:38:10.881
but she would not
want us to mourn today.

01:38:15.485 --> 01:38:17.119
- Thank you, sir.
- Very sorry.

01:38:17.121 --> 01:38:18.519
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, sir.

01:38:18.521 --> 01:38:20.055
- Thank you.
- Very, very sorry.

01:38:20.057 --> 01:38:21.257
Yeah.

01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:27.431
Hey, Dad.

01:38:28.933 --> 01:38:31.533
The flowers
were really lovely.

01:38:31.535 --> 01:38:35.037
Oh, well, thank you, dear.
Glad you liked them.

01:38:35.039 --> 01:38:36.405
We'd, uh...

01:38:36.407 --> 01:38:38.843
We'd like to invite you
to Thanksgiving.

01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:41.612
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:38:44.081 --> 01:38:45.914
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

01:38:45.916 --> 01:38:46.917
Good.

01:38:56.527 --> 01:38:58.362
That's him right there.
That's him right there.

01:39:12.577 --> 01:39:13.979
Where you been, Earl?

01:39:15.447 --> 01:39:17.213
I've been unavailable.

01:39:20.852 --> 01:39:23.319
Why you making us
have to do this, hmm?

01:39:23.321 --> 01:39:24.856
You were warned, <i>viejo.</i>

01:39:26.958 --> 01:39:29.494
"Celebrating the life
of Mary Stone."

01:39:30.395 --> 01:39:32.495
Who the fuck is Mary Stone?

01:39:32.497 --> 01:39:34.466
- Huh?
- That's my wife. She passed.

01:39:38.703 --> 01:39:41.272
Yeah. I know I was warned.

01:39:41.274 --> 01:39:43.706
I went AWOL anyway so...

01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:46.177
I won't feel
no ill will if you...

01:39:46.179 --> 01:39:48.112
Whatever goes on here.

01:39:48.114 --> 01:39:49.814
Just go ahead.

01:39:49.816 --> 01:39:52.819
Do the fucking...
Do what you have to do.

01:39:58.758 --> 01:40:00.758
<i>Gustavo, we found him.</i>

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:02.793
Wait.
They're talking about <i>Tata.</i>

01:40:02.795 --> 01:40:04.261
<i>He was at a funeral.</i>

01:40:04.263 --> 01:40:05.796
<i>His wife was dying of cancer.</i>

01:40:05.798 --> 01:40:07.364
Pero <i>now</i>
<i>he's finishing the run.</i>

01:40:07.366 --> 01:40:09.366
Sounds like they're with him.

01:40:09.368 --> 01:40:11.070
<i>He was warned.</i>

01:40:13.372 --> 01:40:14.774
<i>I don't care.</i>

01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:19.476
<i>Si, si, si.</i>

01:40:19.478 --> 01:40:21.146
They're gonna kill him.

01:40:21.148 --> 01:40:22.513
<i>Gustavo,
he's the best mule we have.</i>

01:40:22.515 --> 01:40:23.747
I need a lock on a GPS now.

01:40:23.749 --> 01:40:25.217
And get the chopper
in the air.

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:26.784
<i>Okay.
Let him finish his drop.</i>

01:40:26.786 --> 01:40:29.221
<i>If he fails, it's your head.</i>

01:40:31.657 --> 01:40:33.258
<i>Get it done.</i>

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:34.594
Okay.

01:40:37.396 --> 01:40:39.931
<i>We have
a location on that GPS track.</i>

01:40:39.933 --> 01:40:44.004
<i>Illinois, a quarter mile east
off Interstate 55, exit 224.</i>

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:46.605
All right, here we go.

01:41:25.747 --> 01:41:28.314
<i>Suspect is moving northbound.</i>

01:41:28.316 --> 01:41:30.448
Unit one, go ahead and block
all northbound traffic.

01:41:30.450 --> 01:41:32.652
Units two and three,
box him in once we're in position.

01:41:32.654 --> 01:41:34.353
- <i>Roger that.</i>
- All right, here we go.

01:41:34.355 --> 01:41:36.157
It all comes down right here.

01:42:14.662 --> 01:42:16.129
All right, here we go.

01:42:16.131 --> 01:42:18.665
<i>Charlie 223,
helo 17 on top.</i>

01:42:18.667 --> 01:42:19.935
<i>Air team,
we have a visual.</i>

01:42:26.675 --> 01:42:28.577
Be smart. Slow down.

01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:34.550
All right.

01:42:36.252 --> 01:42:37.784
Let's go.

01:42:37.786 --> 01:42:39.753
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up!

01:42:39.755 --> 01:42:41.521
Get out of the car!

01:42:41.523 --> 01:42:42.923
Driver, step out
of the vehicle.

01:42:42.925 --> 01:42:44.225
Put your hands in the air!

01:42:44.227 --> 01:42:45.859
Get out
of the fucking vehicle now!

01:42:45.861 --> 01:42:47.228
Get out of the car!

01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:49.099
Get out of the car!

01:42:55.738 --> 01:42:56.871
Step out of the vehicle!

01:42:56.873 --> 01:42:59.273
Put your hands
above your head!

01:42:59.275 --> 01:43:01.876
Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the vehicle!

01:43:01.878 --> 01:43:03.911
Let me see your hands!

01:43:03.913 --> 01:43:05.313
Put your hands in the air!

01:43:05.315 --> 01:43:06.814
- Your hands!
- Step away from the vehicle!

01:43:06.816 --> 01:43:08.515
Turn around,
face the other way!

01:43:08.517 --> 01:43:09.917
- Turn around!
- Turn around

01:43:09.919 --> 01:43:12.086
- and face the other way!
- Turn around!

01:43:12.088 --> 01:43:14.255
Put your hands
behind your head

01:43:14.257 --> 01:43:16.824
and interlace your fingers.

01:43:16.826 --> 01:43:18.659
Now I want you to take
steps back towards me

01:43:18.661 --> 01:43:20.263
to the sound of my voice.

01:43:21.231 --> 01:43:22.665
There you go.

01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:25.802
That's it, keep coming.

01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:28.905
Here we go.

01:43:30.174 --> 01:43:31.541
That's it.

01:43:48.558 --> 01:43:50.528
You.

01:43:51.996 --> 01:43:53.130
Yeah.

01:43:55.866 --> 01:43:57.132
Do you need
more staties here?

01:43:57.134 --> 01:43:58.167
No, no, no.

01:43:58.169 --> 01:43:59.401
We're just gonna talk.

01:43:59.403 --> 01:44:00.604
Okay. All right.

01:44:17.855 --> 01:44:19.357
What happened to your face?

01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:23.326
Nothing.

01:44:23.328 --> 01:44:26.162
I just got what I damn
well deserved, is all.

01:44:26.164 --> 01:44:27.598
And the suit?

01:44:28.799 --> 01:44:30.732
Went to a funeral.

01:44:30.734 --> 01:44:32.569
My ex-wife's funeral.

01:44:32.571 --> 01:44:33.771
I'm sorry.

01:44:35.107 --> 01:44:40.376
Lucky, actually. I got to
spend some time with her.

01:44:40.378 --> 01:44:43.580
She let me in
and my whole family let me in.

01:44:43.582 --> 01:44:45.815
My daughter, everybody.

01:44:45.817 --> 01:44:48.351
Is this the daughter
that wouldn't talk to you?

01:44:48.353 --> 01:44:49.986
Yeah.

01:44:49.988 --> 01:44:51.821
That's right.
You remember that, huh?

01:44:51.823 --> 01:44:53.158
- I do.
- Huh.

01:44:55.327 --> 01:44:56.759
Well...

01:44:56.761 --> 01:44:58.596
Am I the guy who's responsible

01:44:58.598 --> 01:45:01.465
for you missing
your anniversary?

01:45:03.735 --> 01:45:05.135
You know, it's funny.

01:45:05.137 --> 01:45:07.338
After all this work
and the time away,

01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:09.941
you, of all people,
were right.

01:45:12.044 --> 01:45:15.214
I ain't been right
about much in life.

01:45:19.218 --> 01:45:22.052
Well, you made things
straight with your family.

01:45:22.054 --> 01:45:23.055
Yeah.

01:45:23.688 --> 01:45:25.022
I'm glad for you.

01:45:25.024 --> 01:45:27.858
That's the thing.
You just remember that.

01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:30.429
You remember that
with your family.

01:45:31.731 --> 01:45:34.100
You don't need
all that other shit.

01:45:35.501 --> 01:45:37.170
I'll try to.

01:45:40.373 --> 01:45:42.840
You take care
of yourself, okay?

01:45:42.842 --> 01:45:45.077
- You, too.
- Yeah.

01:45:45.778 --> 01:45:47.347
Hang in there.

01:46:15.275 --> 01:46:17.576
Earl Stone is a man
who served his country,

01:46:17.578 --> 01:46:19.177
fought for our freedom,

01:46:19.179 --> 01:46:21.415
and now faces
the loss of his own.

01:46:25.587 --> 01:46:27.620
Murdering cartel thugs

01:46:27.622 --> 01:46:30.789
who not only took advantage
of his good nature,

01:46:30.791 --> 01:46:32.358
but also his advanced age,

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:34.192
his vulnerability.
Your Honor...

01:46:34.194 --> 01:46:35.330
Guilty.

01:46:36.797 --> 01:46:37.998
Earl.

01:46:40.535 --> 01:46:41.967
Earl.

01:46:41.969 --> 01:46:44.172
Mr. Stone, you should
talk to your attorney.

01:46:44.938 --> 01:46:46.738
Earl, don't do this.

01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:49.143
- Earl...
- Guilty, Your Honor.

01:46:49.711 --> 01:46:51.277
I did it.

01:46:51.279 --> 01:46:55.116
Mr. Stone, are you pleading
guilty on all charges?

01:46:56.584 --> 01:46:57.784
Yes.

01:46:59.753 --> 01:47:02.388
Bailiff.
Take him into custody.

01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:06.160
Mr. Stone, you are remanded
into federal prison.

01:47:09.764 --> 01:47:11.466
You did a good job.

01:47:14.869 --> 01:47:17.638
We'll come visit you
every chance we can.

01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:18.940
Thanks.

01:47:21.809 --> 01:47:23.710
Mike and I will
look after the farm.

01:47:23.712 --> 01:47:25.079
Don't you worry, Grandpa.

01:47:26.315 --> 01:47:27.849
I know you will.

01:47:30.985 --> 01:47:34.288
It's just time, is all.

01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:40.027
I could buy anything,
but I couldn't buy time.

01:47:40.029 --> 01:47:42.531
It's okay. We love you.

01:47:48.103 --> 01:47:49.737
All right. Thank you.

01:47:49.739 --> 01:47:52.541
At least we'll always know
where you are.

01:47:54.678 --> 01:47:57.012
Court is adjourned.

01:48:06.855 --> 01:48:10.059
- Good work, Special Agent.
- Thank you, sir.
