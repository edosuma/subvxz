WEBVTT

00:02.369 --> 00:03.768
Why potatoes?

00:03.836 --> 00:06.601
Their first idea
was to clone Naomi,

00:06.673 --> 00:09.972
but l suggested they start
with something smaller.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:19.986 --> 00:22.250
Quite a feat of engineering.

00:22.322 --> 00:23.812
lt's a Teirenian ant colony.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.653
l infused the soil
with a blue ion dye,

00:25.725 --> 00:28.091
so it'd be easier
to see the insects.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.924
They're luminescent.

00:29.996 --> 00:31.156
The drones produce

00:31.231 --> 00:32.720
a fluorescent enzyme
that's activated

00:32.799 --> 00:33.788
by the queen.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.232
Drones and queens?

00:35.335 --> 00:38.304
l thought we were trying
to get these children away

00:38.371 --> 00:39.429
from the Borg.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.006
The project was Mezoti's idea.

00:41.107 --> 00:43.507
l didn't want to discourage
her individuality.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.136
l like bugs.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.372
Well done.

00:47.447 --> 00:50.280
Let me know before
you take up beekeeping.

00:52.185 --> 00:53.447
What have we got here?

00:53.520 --> 00:54.452
lt's Kataris.

00:54.521 --> 00:55.510
Your father's planet.

00:55.588 --> 00:57.283
l've been learning all about it.

00:57.357 --> 00:59.348
Naomi programmed

00:59.426 --> 01:01.451
the geophysical
and atmospheric conditions.

01:01.528 --> 01:04.156
There's quite a storm
in those mountains.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.322
The Arpasian range

01:05.397 --> 01:07.298
is known for high winds
and hail.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.392
l'll remember to bring my coat.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.101
Now, this looks impressive.

01:17.177 --> 01:18.940
lt's a high- resolution

01:19.012 --> 01:20.377
gravimetric sensor array.

01:20.447 --> 01:21.379
Ambitious.

01:21.448 --> 01:22.540
lt'll augment

01:22.615 --> 01:24.446
our ability to scan
for the neutrino flux

01:24.517 --> 01:25.711
associated with wormholes.

01:25.785 --> 01:27.309
lt could help Voyager

01:27.387 --> 01:28.945
find a faster way home.

01:29.055 --> 01:31.489
The engineering principles
are sound.

01:33.359 --> 01:36.487
l expected these projects
to be interesting,

01:36.563 --> 01:38.793
but this is truly exceptional.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.298
Thank you, Captain.

01:40.366 --> 01:42.960
l am very interested
in astrophysics.

01:43.069 --> 01:45.503
Well, you've obviously got
a knack for it.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.836
Well done.

01:47.907 --> 01:51.240
How did you think of scanning
for neutrino fluctuations?

01:51.311 --> 01:53.506
l've been studying
Starfleet records.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.377
He's a remarkable young man.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.712
He hopes to earn
a permanent posting

01:57.784 --> 01:59.308
in Astrometrics one day.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.444
l'm afraid that
won't be possible.

02:01.521 --> 02:03.989
Captain, the boy has
a unique talent.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.025
lt's not a question of merit.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.491
We've made contact
with his parents,

02:08.561 --> 02:11.428
and l've set a course
for their planet.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.994
My scanner is calibrated
to pick up changes

02:16.102 --> 02:17.865
in neutrino trajectories.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.939
That's good news.

04:18.391 --> 04:21.053
You've exceeded your scheduled
time here by one hour.

04:21.127 --> 04:22.253
l am almost finished.

04:22.328 --> 04:23.352
Your work will have to wait.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.828
There's something
we need to discuss.

04:25.898 --> 04:27.661
Look at this.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.166
lt's a star forming
in the Orpisay nebula.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.268
The Orpisay nebula
is out of range

04:39.345 --> 04:40.778
of our sensors.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.338
l increased the resolution
of the long- range scanners.

04:43.416 --> 04:46.408
lmpressive.

04:46.486 --> 04:47.748
When l was on the cube,

04:47.820 --> 04:51.881
l never thought
about what was outside- -

04:51.958 --> 04:53.220
pulsars,

04:53.293 --> 04:54.385
quasars,

04:54.460 --> 04:56.724
nebulas- -

04:56.796 --> 04:58.127
but here in this lab,

04:58.197 --> 05:01.894
l feel like l can see
the entire galaxy.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.800
What did you want
to talk to me about?

05:06.906 --> 05:08.237
You said there was something

05:08.308 --> 05:09.570
we needed to discuss.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.769
Yes. That's correct.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.247
lt's time for you
to regenerate.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.895
Come in.

05:40.039 --> 05:41.802
l'd like the data
you've collected

05:41.874 --> 05:43.136
on lcheb's species

05:43.209 --> 05:45.473
so l can prepare him
for reassimilation.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.478
Maybe we could refer to it

05:47.547 --> 05:50.675
as ''getting reacquainted
with his family.''

05:50.750 --> 05:52.479
lf you prefer.

05:52.552 --> 05:55.487
l'll transfer the files
to Astrometrics.

05:55.555 --> 05:56.954
Thank you.

05:57.056 --> 05:59.115
How'd he take the news?

06:01.627 --> 06:04.061
You haven't told him.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.792
No.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.390
Why not?

06:08.501 --> 06:11.129
lt won't be easy for him
to accept.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.762
He's adapted to life on Voyager.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.433
And you've adapted
to having him here.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.510
My feelings are irrelevant.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.909
Are they?

06:24.317 --> 06:26.581
Would you like me to tell him?

06:26.652 --> 06:29.587
lt's my responsibility...

06:29.655 --> 06:32.818
but l am uncertain
how to proceed.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.656
Well, you've already
helped him make

06:35.728 --> 06:37.696
one difficult transition.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.322
How did you do that?

06:39.399 --> 06:42.630
By giving him the benefit
of my own experiences,

06:42.735 --> 06:46.535
encouraging him to be resilient
in the face of obstacles.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.410
Sounds like a good strategy.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.805
ls your alcove
malfunctioning?

07:24.877 --> 07:27.812
l'm calculating
neutrino trajectories.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.780
You need to regenerate.

07:32.485 --> 07:33.611
Very well.

07:36.422 --> 07:37.548
Wait.

07:40.993 --> 07:42.620
We've located your parents.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.163
Voyager is due to
arrive at their planet

07:45.231 --> 07:46.528
tomorrow.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.496
Do l have to stay with them?

07:51.604 --> 07:54.539
They're your parents.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.768
l don't remember them.

07:58.678 --> 08:00.236
After my parents
were assimilated,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.975
l never saw them again.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.176
You're fortunate
to have this chance.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.151
What about the others?

08:07.220 --> 08:08.414
We haven't been able

08:08.488 --> 08:10.217
to locate their families yet.

08:10.289 --> 08:11.722
That's not what l mean.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.726
What will happen to them
if l leave?

08:14.794 --> 08:16.284
They depend on me.

08:16.362 --> 08:17.989
They'll adapt.

08:23.569 --> 08:26.037
l'll never see you again?

08:28.441 --> 08:30.773
l've been studying
Brunali culture.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.174
lt's very different

08:32.245 --> 08:35.043
from what you've become
accustomed to on Voyager.

08:35.114 --> 08:36.410
ln what way?

08:36.482 --> 08:39.280
They're an
agrarian society.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.684
Their technological
resources are limited.

08:42.755 --> 08:45.383
Are they capable
of space travel?

08:45.458 --> 08:47.585
Yes, but most of their vessels

08:47.660 --> 08:49.594
were destroyed by the Borg.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.994
How will l continue my studies?

08:53.799 --> 08:55.790
l don't know.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.566
lcheb...

09:22.361 --> 09:24.454
l'm detecting
scattered enclaves

09:24.530 --> 09:26.293
on the northern continent- -

09:26.365 --> 09:27.627
all with populations

09:27.700 --> 09:29.065
of fewer than 10,000.

09:29.168 --> 09:30.999
Judging from the residual
gamma radiation,

09:31.103 --> 09:32.331
it appears they've suffered

09:32.438 --> 09:35.373
numerous Borg attacks
over the past decade.

09:35.441 --> 09:36.874
That's not surprising.

09:36.976 --> 09:39.501
There's a Borg transwarp conduit
less than a light- year away.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.104
Not exactly prime real estate.

09:42.181 --> 09:44.843
Tuvok, run continuous scans
for Borg activity.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.680
Tom, put us into
synchronous orbit.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.346
Yes, ma'am.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.980
Seven, you'd better get lcheb.

09:59.632 --> 10:02.760
According to these scans,
you're in perfect health.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.428
Then why does my stomach
feel so strange?

10:05.538 --> 10:08.006
Hmm.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.103
Oh, l should have known.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.739
You've got butterflies
in there.

10:15.815 --> 10:18.409
l never assimilated
butterflies.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.577
lt's an expression used

10:20.653 --> 10:23.349
to describe anxiety
or apprehension,

10:23.422 --> 10:26.118
both of which are
perfectly natural reactions

10:26.192 --> 10:29.093
for someone about to meet
his long- lost parents.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.423
lf it's any comfort,

10:30.496 --> 10:33.465
l'm sure they're just
as nervous about meeting you.

10:33.532 --> 10:34.829
Parents are irrelevant.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.299
Really.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.802
Do you think Naomi's mother
is irrelevant to her?

10:38.871 --> 10:41.965
l have Seven of Nine to
assist me in my education.

10:42.108 --> 10:44.440
l have you to care
for my medical needs.

10:45.544 --> 10:49.674
Your parents can nurture you
in ways this crew can't.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.649
They can explain
the Brunali culture,

10:51.717 --> 10:53.344
share their experiences
with you.

10:53.419 --> 10:54.716
You didn't have parents.

10:54.787 --> 10:55.879
No, but...

10:55.955 --> 10:57.980
You adapted to serve
a vital function

10:58.057 --> 10:59.490
aboard this vessel,

10:59.558 --> 11:01.492
forged relationships
with its crew- -

11:01.594 --> 11:03.585
all without the
benefit of parents.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.722
l had my programming
to fall back on.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.392
And how would your
programming respond

11:08.501 --> 11:11.197
if you were asked to
live with strangers?

11:14.874 --> 11:16.899
Are you damaged?

11:17.076 --> 11:18.668
He's fine.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.144
l was just giving him
a last- minute checkup.

11:22.615 --> 11:23.946
lt's time.

11:26.919 --> 11:29.581
The ''butterflies'' will go away.

12:06.992 --> 12:08.254
Hello.

12:08.327 --> 12:09.885
l'm Captain Janeway.

12:09.995 --> 12:11.758
lcheb.

12:11.831 --> 12:14.197
You've... grown.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.325
He spent several months
in a Borg

12:16.435 --> 12:18.096
maturation chamber.

12:19.705 --> 12:21.570
This is Seven of Nine.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.404
That's a Borg designation,
isn't it?

12:24.477 --> 12:27.503
Like your son, l was liberated
from the collective.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.639
Seven has been instrumental
in helping lcheb

12:29.715 --> 12:30.943
make his transition.

12:31.016 --> 12:32.381
Then we're very grateful

12:32.451 --> 12:33.543
to you.

12:33.619 --> 12:35.746
l'm Leucon, lcheb's father.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.312
This is his mother, Yifay.

12:38.390 --> 12:40.358
How are you?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.860
Fine.

12:44.396 --> 12:45.886
Do these hurt you?

12:47.399 --> 12:48.764
No.

12:52.972 --> 12:56.703
We're very happy to
have you back with us.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.767
Mala, Remi,

12:58.878 --> 13:00.004
Yivel.

13:00.079 --> 13:02.343
Welcome home, lcheb.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.114
l would like

13:10.189 --> 13:11.850
to return to Voyager now.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.806
Thank you for coming.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.307
Where's lcheb?

13:30.376 --> 13:31.900
l thought
it might be better

13:32.044 --> 13:33.705
if we talked
ourselves first.

13:33.779 --> 13:36.714
What exactly is
there to discuss?

13:36.782 --> 13:40.741
How to make this transition
easier for your son.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.879
Please, sit down.

13:47.426 --> 13:49.860
lt won't be easy for him

13:49.929 --> 13:51.897
to give up the luxuries
of your ship.

13:51.964 --> 13:54.364
lt's more than a
question of luxuries.

13:54.433 --> 13:57.061
lcheb has special medical needs.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.296
We have a physician
in our settlement.

13:59.405 --> 14:02.067
We should arrange for him
to consult with our Doctor.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.471
He also requires

14:03.509 --> 14:04.669
daily regeneration.

14:04.743 --> 14:07.211
l'm sure you can adapt
some of our technology

14:07.279 --> 14:08.541
to make that possible.

14:08.614 --> 14:10.673
What about his
educational needs?

14:10.749 --> 14:12.341
Our children go to school.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.885
Well he be able to continue
his studies

14:13.953 --> 14:15.420
in astrometrics
and spatial harmonics?

14:15.487 --> 14:17.352
lf lcheb has an
aptitude for science,

14:17.423 --> 14:18.355
l'm sure he'll find

14:18.424 --> 14:20.415
that we have a great
deal to teach him.

14:20.492 --> 14:22.551
For example?

14:22.628 --> 14:23.890
We've developed
sophisticated

14:23.996 --> 14:26.021
techniques
in agricultural genetics,

14:26.098 --> 14:29.761
which allow us to grow crops
in an inhospitable environment.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.302
lcheb has expressed no interest

14:31.370 --> 14:32.598
in agriculture.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.173
l'm sure, once he's been exposed
to the subject,

14:35.241 --> 14:36.936
he'll find it quite challenging.

14:37.076 --> 14:39.544
There's still the issue
of his safety.

14:39.645 --> 14:42.136
We're perfectly capable
of protecting our son.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.648
Your proximity to a Borg conduit

14:44.717 --> 14:46.810
makes you extremely vulnerable.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.116
l'm curious if you've
ever considered relocating.

14:49.188 --> 14:49.847
Seven.

14:49.922 --> 14:50.854
No.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.356
lt's all right, Captain.

14:52.424 --> 14:53.948
This planet is our home.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.526
We will never leave it.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.528
We will defend it
against the Borg,

14:57.596 --> 15:00.360
or anyone else who threatens us.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.366
Your courage is admirable
but unrealistic.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.026
Wait for me in my ready room.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.070
Captain...
Now.

15:19.618 --> 15:21.677
l apologize for her behavior.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.654
She and lcheb have
grown very close,

15:23.722 --> 15:25.451
but that's no excuse
for rudeness.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.458
We'd like to see
our son now.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.590
Please be patient.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.723
lf we rush things,
your next encounter with him

15:33.799 --> 15:36.165
may not go any better
than the last.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.168
Stay aboard Voyager for a while.

15:38.237 --> 15:41.331
lt'll give lcheb a
chance to get to know you

15:41.440 --> 15:43.908
in an environment
that's familiar to him.

15:43.976 --> 15:46.206
l'll have Neelix
do everything he can

15:46.278 --> 15:48.872
to make you comfortable
while you're here.

15:55.387 --> 15:58.550
Your attitude is making
a difficult situation worse.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.455
l was simply
attempting to ensure

16:00.526 --> 16:01.788
lcheb's well- being.

16:01.860 --> 16:03.020
By insulting his parents?

16:03.095 --> 16:04.790
Those issues needed
to be discussed.

16:04.863 --> 16:06.990
You could've done it
with a little more tact.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.193
Perhaps. But that
doesn't alter the fact

16:09.301 --> 16:12.270
that those individuals may
not be suitable guardians.

16:12.371 --> 16:14.839
Those individuals are
his mother and father.

16:14.940 --> 16:15.872
Which is no guarantee

16:15.941 --> 16:17.499
that they'll be able
to care for him.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.304
He's far more
likely to flourish

16:19.378 --> 16:20.709
if he remains on Voyager.

16:20.779 --> 16:22.713
That's not an option, Seven.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.148
Are you ordering
him off the ship...

16:25.217 --> 16:26.149
That's not what l said...

16:26.218 --> 16:27.480
...so that he can be
assimilated again?

16:27.553 --> 16:29.384
What makes you so sure
that's going to happen?

16:29.455 --> 16:31.685
They shouldn't remain
on that planet.

16:31.757 --> 16:32.587
lt's their home.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.091
lt's not worth protecting.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.821
Who are you to decide that?

16:38.163 --> 16:40.256
Anyone who values
their own goals

16:40.332 --> 16:43.699
over the safety of their
children is irresponsible.

16:43.802 --> 16:47.431
Are we talking
about lcheb's parents or yours?

16:47.539 --> 16:49.598
Both.

16:56.248 --> 16:59.149
lt's not like you to admit
to something like that.

16:59.218 --> 17:03.018
lt would be naive for me to
claim objectivity in this case,

17:03.122 --> 17:06.057
but l'm not prepared
to return lcheb to parents

17:06.090 --> 17:08.116
who may be as careless
as my own.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.184
l know what it's like
to feel protective

17:10.262 --> 17:13.253
towards someone you've helped
through a difficult period.

17:15.233 --> 17:18.226
But lcheb is an individual now.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.305
You have to give him a chance

17:20.372 --> 17:22.670
to form
his own opinions.

17:24.343 --> 17:26.071
lf l do...

17:26.145 --> 17:29.239
and he decides to
remain on Voyager...

17:29.314 --> 17:32.579
Then it'll be my problem.

17:34.853 --> 17:37.321
ls your mother pretty?

17:37.389 --> 17:39.516
What are they like?

17:39.591 --> 17:41.183
l'm busy.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.353
l never met my father.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.522
l don't remember ours.

17:45.597 --> 17:47.565
Neither do l.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.498
Are you going to stay with them?

17:49.601 --> 17:51.796
lf you leave,

17:51.904 --> 17:54.498
who is going to help us
with our science projects?

17:54.606 --> 17:56.301
lf you don't stop
asking questions,

17:56.375 --> 17:58.843
l'm going to put all of you
in a cargo container

17:58.911 --> 17:59.969
and transport you back

18:00.045 --> 18:01.672
to the Borg.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.320
Come with me.

18:10.389 --> 18:11.947
Where?

18:12.024 --> 18:13.821
To dinner with your parents.

18:13.892 --> 18:14.984
l'm working.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.119
You can continue
your work after the meal.

18:17.196 --> 18:20.757
l don't have anything
to talk about with them.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.427
Then it will be
a very quiet evening.

18:23.535 --> 18:25.730
l'm not going.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.965
Your attendance is not optional.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.162
Enjoy your meal.

19:05.577 --> 19:07.511
Come, sit down.

19:09.214 --> 19:10.806
l prefer to stand.

19:12.618 --> 19:16.520
Mr. Neelix let me use his galley
to prepare some poma.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.522
l'm not hungry.

19:20.192 --> 19:23.423
lt was your favorite food
when you were little.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.486
l'm not little anymore.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.797
No.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.768
No, you're not.

19:34.206 --> 19:39.610
Your mother worked hard
on that meal.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.771
Couldn't you at least try it?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.349
Good.

20:23.188 --> 20:24.621
lsn't it?

20:31.196 --> 20:33.460
Nice to see the family
back together again,

20:33.532 --> 20:34.829
isn't it?

20:36.568 --> 20:38.763
When you were little,
you would only eat...

20:56.855 --> 20:58.982
The Borg didn't leave us
much to work with,

20:59.057 --> 21:02.458
but we didn't need much,
just a little ingenuity.

21:02.561 --> 21:05.428
Everything you see,
we built with our own hands- -

21:05.464 --> 21:08.558
our homes, cultivation bays...

21:08.634 --> 21:10.602
What's this?

21:10.669 --> 21:12.796
A genetic resequencer.

21:12.904 --> 21:15.372
We use it to alter the
DNA of certain plants

21:15.474 --> 21:17.738
to conform with
environmental conditions.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.299
You built this as well.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.675
We adapted parts
from damaged vessels.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.806
Nothing's been wasted.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.440
Efficient.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.918
Efficiency's one attribute
we share with the Borg.

21:28.987 --> 21:31.012
ln our case,
it's a necessity.

21:33.525 --> 21:36.756
l know our settlement
seems primitive...

21:36.828 --> 21:38.762
compared to Voyager,

21:38.830 --> 21:41.390
but l promise you,
that will change.

21:41.466 --> 21:42.797
What about space travel?

21:42.901 --> 21:44.835
Someday...

21:44.903 --> 21:46.632
we'll have ships
that rival Voyager,

21:46.738 --> 21:48.103
but we need the dedication

21:48.173 --> 21:50.004
of young people like you
to help us.

21:50.108 --> 21:52.008
lcheb!

21:52.110 --> 21:53.509
How are you?

21:53.578 --> 21:55.978
Well! Thank you!

21:56.048 --> 21:58.812
Maybe later you can join us
up on the field

21:58.884 --> 22:00.749
for a game of pala!

22:02.754 --> 22:05.018
l don't remember how to play!

22:05.090 --> 22:07.490
lt will come back to you!

22:09.428 --> 22:11.692
You used to be
quite an athlete.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.897
You can make
a difference here, lcheb.

22:16.034 --> 22:18.127
l don't know anything
about agriculture...

22:18.236 --> 22:19.794
or genetics.

22:19.905 --> 22:22.169
lt won't take you long to learn,

22:22.240 --> 22:24.037
not with a mind like yours.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.938
lt's time to return to Voyager.

22:28.046 --> 22:30.378
l am staying here tonight.

22:30.449 --> 22:32.815
They don't have
a regeneration unit.

22:32.884 --> 22:34.852
We're going to have
to install one eventually.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.478
Might as well do it now.

22:37.889 --> 22:39.220
As far as l'm aware,

22:39.291 --> 22:41.054
he hasn't decided
to remain here yet.

22:41.126 --> 22:43.560
But he has asked
to stay tonight.

22:46.832 --> 22:48.697
Return with me to the ship.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.496
We'll prepare
a regeneration unit.

22:56.174 --> 22:57.903
l've adapted
this neural transceiver

22:57.976 --> 23:00.069
to interface
with the portable regenerator.

23:00.145 --> 23:03.512
lt has enough power
to complete one full cycle.

23:03.582 --> 23:06.278
We'll have to devise
a way of recharging it.

23:06.351 --> 23:08.649
lf lcheb decides to stay.

23:12.190 --> 23:14.488
My wife and l appreciate

23:14.559 --> 23:16.424
everything you've
done for our son.

23:16.495 --> 23:18.224
lt's obvious you
care about him.

23:18.296 --> 23:20.821
He's a unique individual.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.867
Yes, he is.

23:22.968 --> 23:25.232
To get him back is... well...

23:25.337 --> 23:27.134
a miracle.

23:28.507 --> 23:31.067
How was he taken?

23:35.213 --> 23:37.147
Since the Borg
first attacked us,

23:37.215 --> 23:40.707
we've taken great pains
to hide whatever new technology

23:40.786 --> 23:41.946
we develop.

23:42.053 --> 23:44.419
So that passing cubes won't be
attracted to your planet.

23:44.489 --> 23:48.255
Unfortunately, we haven't
always been successful.

23:50.629 --> 23:54.326
One morning, about
four years ago...

23:57.302 --> 23:58.826
lcheb heard me talking

23:58.937 --> 24:01.030
about a new
fertilization array

24:01.139 --> 24:03.699
we'd constructed
in the lower field.

24:03.809 --> 24:06.004
He wanted to see it.

24:06.077 --> 24:07.704
l told him l'd take
him the next day.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.541
But he was impatient,
the way boys can be.

24:11.683 --> 24:14.675
l never even realized
he'd wandered off

24:14.753 --> 24:16.618
when the alarm sounded.

24:16.688 --> 24:20.215
lt turns out the Borg
were just as interested

24:20.292 --> 24:23.090
in our new technology
as lcheb was.

24:24.596 --> 24:26.530
They took him...

24:26.598 --> 24:27.997
assimilated everyone

24:28.066 --> 24:30.466
in the area.

24:30.569 --> 24:34.061
Oh. lf only l'd kept
a closer eye on him.

24:34.172 --> 24:37.471
lcheb has a mind of his own.

24:39.010 --> 24:40.568
But still...

24:40.645 --> 24:43.478
it's hard not to blame myself.

24:43.548 --> 24:46.676
Your parents must've felt
the same way when they lost you.

24:46.751 --> 24:50.778
My parents were with me
when the Borg attacked.

24:50.856 --> 24:53.586
l can't imagine what that
must've been like for them,

24:53.658 --> 24:55.922
watching their daughter
being assimilated...

24:55.994 --> 24:58.792
helpless to defend her?

24:58.864 --> 25:02.595
lt's important that lcheb
regenerate for six uninterrupted

25:02.701 --> 25:04.862
hours.

25:04.970 --> 25:06.562
l understand.

25:06.671 --> 25:07.831
He may resist.

25:07.973 --> 25:10.498
He doesn't like to waste time.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.343
l have had to contend with
his lack of patience as well.

25:17.649 --> 25:21.642
Over there is a star
called Kelsin lll,

25:21.720 --> 25:24.883
and to the west is
the Orlitus Cluster.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.288
There, just above it,

25:27.359 --> 25:29.793
when you connect
those six stars,

25:29.861 --> 25:32.762
they form what we call
the Great Horn.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.969
l see it.

25:39.337 --> 25:41.134
You inherited your love

25:41.206 --> 25:43.674
of the stars from your father.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.937
Being on that starship,

25:46.077 --> 25:49.672
you learned much more
about astronomy than l have.

25:49.748 --> 25:51.477
Our little window can't compare

25:51.550 --> 25:53.313
to Voyager's Astrometrics Lab.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.579
No.

25:54.653 --> 25:56.416
But it's nice.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.648
You see?

25:59.724 --> 26:03.125
We have everything
we need right here- -

26:03.228 --> 26:08.666
a warm fire, good food
that we grow ourselves,

26:08.700 --> 26:11.134
and people who love us.

26:11.202 --> 26:13.670
lcheb has people on Voyager

26:13.772 --> 26:15.603
who love him, too.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.768
You've grown attached
to the crew on that ship,

26:20.845 --> 26:22.210
haven't you?

26:22.280 --> 26:26.046
They've provided for me,
given me opportunities.

26:26.117 --> 26:28.244
They're good people- -

26:28.320 --> 26:31.312
people who've experienced
hardship themselves.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.323
Seven of Nine

26:33.391 --> 26:36.053
told me
about your science project.

26:36.127 --> 26:38.891
She said it might prove
very useful.

26:38.964 --> 26:41.398
lt's designed
to detect wormholes.

26:41.466 --> 26:43.900
How will that benefit them?

26:44.002 --> 26:46.630
lt may help them find
a way back to Earth.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.763
Why is that so important
to them?

26:51.843 --> 26:53.777
lt's their home.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.716
lnteresting, isn't it?

26:59.784 --> 27:01.809
What?

27:01.920 --> 27:04.286
With all their technology,

27:04.356 --> 27:08.622
their opportunity
to explore the galaxy,

27:08.693 --> 27:12.288
the thing they want most
is to get home.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.669
Good morning.

27:23.742 --> 27:26.142
Did you regenerate
successfully?

27:26.211 --> 27:28.406
Yes, and l slept...

27:28.480 --> 27:31.005
under the stars.

27:31.082 --> 27:33.016
You should try it.

27:33.084 --> 27:35.780
You weren't in
class this morning.

27:35.854 --> 27:37.583
The others missed you.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.782
l was helping my father.

27:43.628 --> 27:46.096
There is something
we need to discuss.

27:50.368 --> 27:52.336
What is it?

27:55.774 --> 27:57.901
You've decided
to stay with them.

27:59.978 --> 28:01.240
Yes.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.712
You're certain?

28:03.748 --> 28:05.943
This is my home.

28:06.017 --> 28:09.145
l have a responsibility
to help them rebuild it.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.457
l'll inform the Captain.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.493
Thank you.

28:17.262 --> 28:19.287
l'm sure you'll want
to say good- bye

28:19.364 --> 28:21.332
to the other children.

28:36.581 --> 28:37.843
lnside, you'll find padds

28:37.916 --> 28:40.180
containing data on
a variety of subjects

28:40.251 --> 28:43.379
that will allow you to
continue your studies.

28:43.455 --> 28:47.391
l've also included a
high- resolution telescope.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.757
lt's a poor substitute
for astrometric sensors.

28:49.828 --> 28:51.489
l will use it every day.

29:01.239 --> 29:04.003
Good- bye, lcheb, and good luck.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.543
Thank you, Captain.

29:06.644 --> 29:08.839
l hope you find a way home.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.698
Warning.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.103
Regeneration cycle incomplete.

30:13.578 --> 30:14.943
What is it?

30:15.079 --> 30:17.445
l can't regenerate.

30:18.516 --> 30:19.505
Warning.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.074
Explain.

30:21.152 --> 30:22.847
Regeneration cycle incomplete.

30:22.921 --> 30:24.912
l miss lcheb.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.549
So do l...

30:28.626 --> 30:30.218
but we'll adapt.

30:30.295 --> 30:31.956
Now return to your alcove.

30:32.030 --> 30:36.091
lf you find my parents,
will l have to go with them?

30:36.201 --> 30:40.137
We'll discuss that
when and if the time comes.

30:40.205 --> 30:43.299
l hope you don't find them.

30:45.777 --> 30:47.438
Regenerate.

30:53.885 --> 30:55.819
Seven?

30:55.887 --> 30:57.445
Yes?

30:57.522 --> 31:00.116
What if the Borg try to
assimilate lcheb again?

31:00.191 --> 31:01.852
His people lack resources.

31:01.926 --> 31:05.384
The Borg have little reason
to return to their planet.

31:05.463 --> 31:08.091
What if lcheb's on a ship?

31:08.166 --> 31:09.793
Unlikely.

31:09.901 --> 31:12.665
He was on a ship last time.

31:12.770 --> 31:14.670
You're mistaken.

31:14.739 --> 31:17.264
He was on the surface
when he was assimilated.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.899
No. He wasn't.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.273
A class- 1 transport

31:21.346 --> 31:24.179
was detected in Grid 649...

31:24.249 --> 31:25.341
one life- form...

31:25.416 --> 31:27.976
species: Brunali.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.498
This better be important.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.158
lt is.

31:43.268 --> 31:44.599
Sorry, l don't read Borg.

31:44.702 --> 31:45.964
You'll have
to translate.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.401
This is tactical data

31:47.472 --> 31:49.565
from the cube
where we found the children.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.005
lt says that lcheb was alone

31:51.142 --> 31:52.871
aboard an unarmed
transport vessel

31:52.944 --> 31:54.138
when the Borg took him.

31:54.212 --> 31:56.237
Oh, why are you
telling me this

31:56.314 --> 31:58.179
at 0300 hours?

31:58.249 --> 32:00.615
lcheb's father told me
the boy was assimilated

32:00.718 --> 32:02.015
on the planet's surface.

32:02.053 --> 32:04.521
ls it possible
you misunderstood?

32:04.589 --> 32:07.023
No. He was very specific.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.025
That cube was disabled

32:09.093 --> 32:10.321
by a deadly pathogen.

32:10.395 --> 32:11.862
lt suffered extensive damage.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.228
lsn't it possible
these records were corrupted?

32:14.299 --> 32:16.893
Perhaps, but l found
another inconsistency

32:17.001 --> 32:18.229
in Leucon's story.

32:18.336 --> 32:21.203
He told me lcheb was assimilated
four years ago,

32:21.272 --> 32:23.172
but further analysis indicates

32:23.241 --> 32:24.708
the Borg attacked three times

32:24.809 --> 32:26.071
during the last decade- -

32:26.144 --> 32:27.668
nine years ago, six years ago

32:27.745 --> 32:29.042
and again last year.

32:31.049 --> 32:32.539
All right.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.484
Let's assume your information
is accurate.

32:35.553 --> 32:36.850
What does it prove?

32:36.921 --> 32:38.354
His father was lying.

32:38.423 --> 32:39.890
Why would he do that?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.949
l'm not certain, but we have

32:42.093 --> 32:43.754
an obligation to find out.

32:43.828 --> 32:45.352
What are you proposing?

32:45.430 --> 32:47.421
That we return to the planet,

32:47.498 --> 32:49.432
demand an explanation.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.297
Those people have
been through enough.

32:51.402 --> 32:53.199
Do we really need
to interrogate them?

32:53.304 --> 32:54.430
We have a responsibility

32:54.539 --> 32:55.733
to ensure lcheb's safety.

32:55.840 --> 32:59.640
He chose to stay
with his parents.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.372
Maybe he didn't have
all the information.

33:01.479 --> 33:04.277
Just because they weren't
completely candid with you

33:04.315 --> 33:05.247
doesn't mean
they're unfit parents.

33:05.316 --> 33:09.184
At some point...
you have to let go.

33:10.254 --> 33:12.518
l know what you're thinking- -

33:12.590 --> 33:14.319
that l'm having
emotional difficulty

33:14.392 --> 33:16.553
accepting my separation
from lcheb.

33:16.627 --> 33:19.596
And you're correct,

33:19.664 --> 33:22.030
but if there's a possibility
he's in danger,

33:22.100 --> 33:23.067
even a remote one,

33:23.167 --> 33:26.136
l have to do whatever l can
to protect him.

33:26.237 --> 33:30.697
lf l don't, l'll be no better
than my own parents.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.741
Couldn't we at least
wait a few days?

33:35.813 --> 33:37.178
What would that accomplish?

33:37.248 --> 33:38.545
He's just
getting settled.

33:38.616 --> 33:39.878
The longer we wait,

33:39.951 --> 33:41.919
the harder it'll be
for everyone.

33:41.986 --> 33:43.886
You know that.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.582
Why do it at all?

33:45.656 --> 33:47.487
There's nothing compelling us

33:47.558 --> 33:50.322
to go through with it.

33:50.395 --> 33:52.625
lt's what he was born for.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.961
Hasn't he been through enough?

33:55.033 --> 33:58.491
Why not give him a chance
at an ordinary life?

33:58.569 --> 34:00.469
He's not an ordinary child.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.300
No, but he can help us
in other ways.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.465
He's bright.

34:03.608 --> 34:04.597
He- he's hardworking...

34:04.709 --> 34:05.676
Leucon...

34:05.777 --> 34:07.745
his return was a gift.

34:07.812 --> 34:09.905
We can't waste it.

34:11.482 --> 34:14.007
l don't want to lose him
a second time.

34:14.085 --> 34:16.781
To survive, we all have
to make sacrifices.

34:16.853 --> 34:18.650
You taught me that.

34:20.491 --> 34:24.359
We won three games in a row.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.290
Sit down, lcheb.

34:33.737 --> 34:36.206
We need to talk.

34:42.580 --> 34:46.311
You know that
you're very important to us.

34:46.384 --> 34:48.318
Yes.

34:52.056 --> 34:54.353
What you don't know is why.

34:55.893 --> 34:57.520
What do you mean?

35:05.970 --> 35:07.130
What is that?

35:07.238 --> 35:09.263
lf you relax, it won't hurt you.

35:09.373 --> 35:10.431
Father...

35:10.541 --> 35:12.600
You'd better hold him.

35:12.677 --> 35:15.373
What are you doing to me?

35:15.446 --> 35:17.380
No!

35:25.323 --> 35:27.848
Prepare the launch.

35:38.736 --> 35:40.226
Hail them.

35:42.406 --> 35:44.169
We didn't expect
to see you again, Captain.

35:44.242 --> 35:46.267
We'd like to ask you
a few questions,

35:46.344 --> 35:47.936
if you don't mind.

35:48.012 --> 35:49.479
Questions?

35:49.547 --> 35:50.809
Regarding lcheb

35:50.882 --> 35:52.782
and the circumstances
of his assimilation.

35:52.850 --> 35:54.841
We've already discussed that.

35:54.919 --> 35:58.184
The story you told me
was inconsistent with our data.

35:58.256 --> 36:00.486
We don't owe you
any explanations.

36:00.591 --> 36:02.855
ln that case,
l'd like to talk to lcheb.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.486
He's not here.

36:04.562 --> 36:06.996
Where is he?

36:07.064 --> 36:09.089
That's not your concern.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.135
Scan for his bio- signs.

36:13.771 --> 36:15.830
He is not in the settlement.

36:15.940 --> 36:18.135
l'm detecting
a Brunali transport vessel.

36:18.209 --> 36:20.074
Distance:
nine million kilometers.

36:20.144 --> 36:23.477
lt's heading for the coordinates
of the transwarp conduit.

36:23.548 --> 36:25.709
According to these readings,

36:25.783 --> 36:27.717
that ship is traveling
at warp 9.8.

36:27.785 --> 36:28.979
lt only looks that way.

36:29.053 --> 36:31.180
lt's been designed to emit
a false warp signature- -

36:31.255 --> 36:33.883
strong enough to
penetrate subspace.

36:33.991 --> 36:37.483
They're using it as bait
to attract the Borg.

36:37.562 --> 36:40.030
lcheb's on that vessel,
isn't he?

36:40.097 --> 36:42.395
He's fighting for his people.

36:42.466 --> 36:44.866
Alone, on an unarmed transport.

36:44.969 --> 36:46.596
We don't have particle weapons

36:46.704 --> 36:48.831
or powerful starships
at our disposal.

36:48.940 --> 36:52.068
We're forced to use
the only resource we have.

36:52.143 --> 36:53.405
Your children?

36:53.477 --> 36:54.535
No.

36:54.612 --> 36:56.705
Our genetic expertise.

36:56.781 --> 36:59.113
lcheb's not bait.

36:59.183 --> 37:00.480
He's a weapon.

37:00.585 --> 37:02.985
The first cube that captured him

37:03.020 --> 37:04.954
was infected by a pathogen.

37:05.022 --> 37:07.183
lcheb was the carrier,
wasn't he?

37:07.258 --> 37:09.488
Every time we try to rebuild,
begin to make progress,

37:09.560 --> 37:11.653
the Borg come
and take it away from us.

37:11.729 --> 37:14.061
Tom, set a course
for that transport vessel,

37:14.131 --> 37:15.063
full impulse.

37:15.132 --> 37:16.394
Aye, Captain.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.195
You have no right to interfere.

37:18.302 --> 37:20.167
We're trying to save
our civilization.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.172
By taking away lcheb's future.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.401
lf we don't stop the Borg,

37:24.475 --> 37:26.875
the Brunali have no future.

37:26.944 --> 37:28.844
Captain, a Borg ship

37:28.913 --> 37:31.507
will emerge from that conduit
at any moment.

37:31.582 --> 37:32.776
You'll be destroyed.

37:32.850 --> 37:34.112
We'll take our chances.

37:34.185 --> 37:35.277
End transmission.

37:37.188 --> 37:41.352
Red Alert. Battle stations.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.896
We're coming within range,
Captain.

37:46.964 --> 37:47.896
l'm picking up

37:47.965 --> 37:49.159
lcheb's life- signs.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.326
Bio- scans indicate
he's unconscious.

37:51.435 --> 37:52.993
Transport him to Sick Bay.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.799
l can't. There's some kind
of interference.

37:54.905 --> 37:56.372
lt's the conduit.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.499
By my estimate,
a Borg vessel will emerge

37:58.609 --> 37:59.906
in less than 40 seconds.

37:59.977 --> 38:01.968
Transfer auxiliary power
to the transporters.

38:03.881 --> 38:06.679
l still can't establish a lock,
not at this distance.

38:06.751 --> 38:07.809
30 seconds.

38:07.918 --> 38:10.079
Tom, get us closer to that ship.

38:10.154 --> 38:11.519
Yes, ma'am.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.456
The conduit's opening.
20 seconds.

38:19.530 --> 38:20.588
Seven?

38:20.665 --> 38:21.927
Still out of range.

38:21.999 --> 38:22.966
You heard her, Tom.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.626
When that Borg ship
comes through,

38:24.735 --> 38:27.363
l'm going to have a hell
of a time getting away from it.

38:27.471 --> 38:28.699
One problem at a time.

38:28.806 --> 38:29.830
Ten seconds...

38:29.974 --> 38:31.669
nine... eight...

38:31.742 --> 38:32.970
l've got a lock.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.306
Transport in progress.

38:34.378 --> 38:36.346
- ...five... four...
- He's in Sick Bay.

38:36.414 --> 38:38.314
Get us out of here, maximum...

38:43.921 --> 38:45.684
Target their tractor beam
generator.

38:45.756 --> 38:47.690
Phasers targeted.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.282
Fire.

38:52.997 --> 38:53.895
No effect.

38:54.031 --> 38:54.895
We are the Borg.

38:55.032 --> 38:57.125
You will be assimilated.

38:57.234 --> 38:58.895
Resistance is futile.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.037
Perhaps not.

39:00.137 --> 39:02.503
There is a way to get a weapon
through their shields.

39:02.573 --> 39:03.801
l'm listening.

39:03.874 --> 39:05.705
Transport a photon torpedo
to the Brunali vessel.

39:05.776 --> 39:07.607
Set it to detonate as soon
as it's inside the sphere.

39:07.678 --> 39:11.444
That will occur
in approximately 20 seconds.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.245
However, Voyager will be inside
less than three seconds later.

39:14.318 --> 39:15.580
Tom, full reverse thrusters.

39:15.653 --> 39:17.280
lt might buy us
a couple more seconds.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.185
Do it.

39:21.392 --> 39:24.020
Transport complete.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.427
Detonation in
ten, nine...

39:30.534 --> 39:31.660
...five... four...

39:31.769 --> 39:32.997
Tom, go to warp on my mark.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.071
Three, two...

39:34.138 --> 39:35.571
All hands, brace for impact.

39:39.076 --> 39:41.476
Now, Mr. Paris!

39:44.548 --> 39:46.140
The Borg vessel has taken

39:46.217 --> 39:47.309
heavy damage.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.682
They are not pursuing.

39:56.994 --> 39:59.895
Are you saying
his parents reinfected him?

39:59.997 --> 40:01.897
No. They merely sedated him.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.591
l don't understand.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.760
He was genetically engineered

40:05.870 --> 40:09.271
to produce the pathogen...
from birth.

40:10.975 --> 40:12.670
Bred to kill Borg.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.404
ls he in danger?

40:14.478 --> 40:16.412
l can suppress the pathogen.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.574
He'll be fine... physically.

40:21.852 --> 40:23.183
He's going to need help

40:23.254 --> 40:25.415
coming to terms
with what's happened.

40:25.489 --> 40:26.820
Captain, l...

40:26.891 --> 40:28.859
Use your maternal instincts.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.450
They worked before.

40:46.343 --> 40:48.004
l thought you were studying

40:48.112 --> 40:49.636
spatial harmonics.

40:49.713 --> 40:52.876
My parents suggested
l might have an aptitude

40:52.950 --> 40:55.145
for genetics as well.

40:57.221 --> 40:58.381
l see.

41:04.228 --> 41:06.492
What have you learned?

41:06.564 --> 41:10.557
This is the genome
of a typical Brunali male...

41:10.668 --> 41:13.603
and this is my DNA.

41:13.671 --> 41:15.536
They're nearly identical,

41:15.606 --> 41:18.131
but do you notice
the differences

41:18.242 --> 41:21.370
in the third, 13th
and 17th chromosomes?

41:21.445 --> 41:22.776
Yes.

41:22.847 --> 41:25.407
My parents made
microgenetic alterations

41:25.483 --> 41:27.610
so l would produce the pathogen.

41:27.685 --> 41:29.846
Quite ingenious.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.213
lt's also barbaric.

41:33.290 --> 41:35.758
They were trying
to defend themselves...

41:35.826 --> 41:37.054
their way of life...

41:37.127 --> 41:39.561
preserve their species.

41:39.630 --> 41:41.860
l know how difficult it is

41:41.932 --> 41:44.958
to acknowledge
your parents' faults,

41:45.135 --> 41:47.603
but what they did was wrong.

41:47.671 --> 41:50.401
You don't have to forgive them.

41:50.474 --> 41:54.410
Do you think
they will ever forgive me?

41:54.478 --> 41:56.207
For what?

41:56.280 --> 41:58.908
l could have destroyed
that sphere.

41:58.983 --> 42:00.780
l failed them.

42:00.885 --> 42:02.648
You would have been
reassimilated.

42:02.686 --> 42:05.280
l know, but...

42:05.356 --> 42:07.688
But what?

42:07.758 --> 42:10.727
Maybe it was my destiny.

42:12.730 --> 42:14.197
Maybe.

42:16.734 --> 42:19.396
ln the future, you may choose
to fight the Borg,

42:19.503 --> 42:21.403
but you'll do it
in your own way.

42:23.574 --> 42:25.132
You're an individual,

42:25.242 --> 42:29.178
and you have the right
to determine your own destiny.

42:31.815 --> 42:34.215
lt's time to regenerate.

42:40.424 --> 42:42.619
And if l prefer
to continue studying?

42:47.298 --> 42:49.596
lt's your decision.
