01:00.561 --> 01:04.482
<i>I was 18
when I wrote my novel "Sarah.</i>

01:04.607 --> 01:07.944
<i>Never thought it'd become a best seller
with all these fancy people</i>

01:08.069 --> 01:12.698
<i>wantin' to meet me,
the elusive JT Leroy,</i>

01:14.075 --> 01:18.663
<i>but I prefer to be a shut-in 'cause
when I'm writin' or on the phone,</i>

01:18.788 --> 01:22.166
<i>I get to show people
exactly what I wanna show 'em.</i>

01:22.291 --> 01:27.463
<i>I can focus on the words
and just... leave my body behind.</i>

01:53.281 --> 01:55.157
- Dude, it's so good.
- Yeah?

01:55.908 --> 01:58.452
We just got the demos back
from the studio,

01:58.577 --> 02:00.663
so, yeah, I'm pretty fuckin' excited.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.878
- Is that her? Is that Laura?
- Uh-huh. Yeah, no, that's her.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.755
- Cool.
- Pretty fucking great, right?

02:09.880 --> 02:11.090
Yeah.

02:11.215 --> 02:12.550
Man, she's...

02:13.509 --> 02:15.678
I just can't wait for you to meet her.

02:18.014 --> 02:20.516
I fucking live here now.
I can't believe this.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.518
Fuck, yes, you live here!

02:23.436 --> 02:25.438
Dude, you made it out of Mom's place.

02:25.813 --> 02:29.400
You're going up in the world.
I'm proud of you. Proud of you.

02:29.525 --> 02:30.609
Thanks.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.253
Hey, hey!

02:49.670 --> 02:52.631
Hey, come in. This is us.

02:52.757 --> 02:56.344
Kitchen's right over here. Cooker.
Careful. There's books everywhere.

02:56.469 --> 02:58.512
- These are beautiful.
- I wouldn't touch that.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.765
We got lead. I had it tested.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.268
All right, this is it.
This is where the magic happens.

03:05.019 --> 03:08.230
- This is so cool, Geoff.
- Right? Now, listen.

03:08.356 --> 03:13.152
Couch opens up. Make yourself comfy
and I'll make some tea. You want a tea?

03:14.111 --> 03:15.571
I'd love a beer.

03:16.489 --> 03:18.282
Beer. Right on. OK. You're in luck.

03:18.407 --> 03:22.203
I just made a fresh batch
of home brew. Cool.

03:22.328 --> 03:24.080
Hey, yo! Come meet my sister!

03:24.205 --> 03:25.623
Be right there!

03:26.874 --> 03:29.144
Anyway, every time I tell 'em no,

03:29.168 --> 03:31.754
I can feel 'em wantin' more.

03:31.879 --> 03:36.133
They just can't believe this itty-bitty
Southern rent boy is denying 'em.

03:37.468 --> 03:40.721
I gotta admit, I like having the power.

03:41.764 --> 03:45.309
All right, yeah. Yeah, thanks.

03:46.102 --> 03:48.020
Same time tomorrow. Bye.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.024
Where is she?

03:52.149 --> 03:54.443
- Where is she?
- Hey.

03:54.568 --> 03:58.781
Oh, look at you. Oh, Savannah.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.201
Geoff's baby sister.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.763
- Oh, I see your soul in your smile.
- Cool, you guys have met.

04:04.787 --> 04:06.622
- You guys have met.
- Look at this creature.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.067
- Welcome to our little chateau.
- Just as you said.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.086
- The smile I fell in love with.
- You made this?

04:11.127 --> 04:14.338
- I'm getting good at this.
- You're good at everything, baby.

04:15.381 --> 04:16.673
I heard the music in the car.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.510
- It is good. It's really...
- Amazing, right?

04:19.635 --> 04:22.179
It's so cool! He's in a zone!

04:22.304 --> 04:25.433
- I'm just writin' lyrics.
- She's just writing...? No, no.

04:25.558 --> 04:28.185
This woman is turning my music
into these beautiful songs.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.271
We're writing two, three songs a day.
It's insane.

04:30.396 --> 04:32.356
- He's on fire.
- Sounds like it's happening.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.025
- You're on fire.
- We're on fire.

04:35.151 --> 04:38.237
- What's that?
- Oh, it's just this thing I made.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.162
I had an extra roll of duct tape
lying around.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.992
- Wait a minute. Hold on.
- That's pretty cool.

04:43.117 --> 04:46.871
Yeah. Just a thing you made?
That is not just a thing.

04:46.996 --> 04:51.959
What is that, like magical unicorn
backpack? That is blowing my mind.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.671
That's pure art.
That's like creative genius.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.174
Don't... Don't put that stuff down.
Right, baby?

04:58.299 --> 04:59.300
Hm-hmm.

04:59.425 --> 05:02.011
- Yeah. Yeah. No, fuck, yeah. Of course.
- Right?

05:02.136 --> 05:03.736
You gotta take her
to Lee's party.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.139
- Right?
- You gotta go.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.433
- We gotta go! We gotta go!
- Yeah, first night!

05:07.558 --> 05:09.118
- You're gonna come?
- Of course.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.395
- Anything you wanna do, I'm open.
- You gonna come?

05:11.520 --> 05:14.040
- She just got here. You've gotta come.
- If you want me to come...

05:14.064 --> 05:16.609
Come on, we don't want you to come,
we need you to come.

05:16.734 --> 05:18.277
- You're pulling me in.
- We need you.

05:18.402 --> 05:21.655
You're dragging me into a celebration!

05:21.780 --> 05:25.451
You're going to Lee's party!
Sav's in San Francisco!

05:25.576 --> 05:27.620
Yo, what's up?

05:28.287 --> 05:30.039
Hey, what's up?

05:30.164 --> 05:34.960
I'll put this on you. We share clothes.
God, it looks amazing with your hair.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.254
Oh, Samuel!

05:37.963 --> 05:40.424
This is Geoff's sister Savannah!

05:40.883 --> 05:42.468
She's taking over his old apartment.

05:42.593 --> 05:47.681
- I'm Sav, nice to meet you.
- Twist & Scream poster is on the wall.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.933
Oh, shit!

05:49.058 --> 05:51.018
That's so beautiful.
That's our band. Yeah.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.144
No way!

05:52.269 --> 05:54.313
- So you're an artist?
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.731
- What's your name?
- Sophie.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.943
- Sophie. What kind of art?
- It's, like, conceptual.

06:06.659 --> 06:08.744
And the writing has been amazing.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.288
I'm finally not paying the rent
with phone sex.

06:11.956 --> 06:14.458
And I'm getting some offers.
It's like...

06:14.583 --> 06:17.878
- You say you did phone sex?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.548
It's one of the more creative jobs ever.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.673
You know, you have to get
into the role-play of it.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.761
But as a writer, it's in the madness
of creating a character,

06:25.886 --> 06:27.388
you know what I mean?

06:29.974 --> 06:33.227
And then their attention
turns to Sophie?

06:34.353 --> 06:36.772
Because of her rinky-dink paintings?

06:36.897 --> 06:41.068
I mean, I'm sorry, but, like, she's
getting that 'cause she's a cute girl

06:41.193 --> 06:44.446
with a cute little fucking ass,
and her cute little art.

06:46.323 --> 06:50.744
Can you imagine
if they knew I was JT Leroy?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.540
Right?

06:54.665 --> 06:57.459
If they knew I was
a New York Times best-selling author?

06:57.585 --> 07:00.963
- I mean, that's so crazy.
- Yeah, well, then tell them!

07:01.088 --> 07:02.339
Geoff.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.676
You know I can't do that.

07:11.849 --> 07:13.892
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

07:14.018 --> 07:18.897
<i>What if I do go out,
but with some kind of disguise?</i>

07:27.865 --> 07:29.033
Oh!

07:29.408 --> 07:32.369
- What's up?
- You wanna keep a secret?

07:39.001 --> 07:40.252
What's this?

07:40.377 --> 07:44.632
It's my book Sarah.
My shot at immortality.

07:45.841 --> 07:48.260
Oh, so JT's like your pen name.

07:49.053 --> 07:50.971
More like my avatar.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.223
Who is this kid?

07:53.349 --> 07:55.476
That's just a photo
I found at a thrift store.

07:55.601 --> 07:58.646
I loved it 'cause he looks like a kid
in a Dennis Cooper novel.

07:58.771 --> 08:02.316
- I love Dennis Cooper.
- Of course you do. Oh!

08:02.441 --> 08:04.068
Hey, do you know Mary Gaitskill?

08:04.193 --> 08:07.571
Um, yeah, but I haven't... I haven't
read any of her stuff. I want to.

08:07.696 --> 08:08.906
Oh, you're gonna love it.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.241
I'm just finishing the Colette books
right now.

08:11.367 --> 08:13.827
My God, I remember the first time
I read Colette.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.913
I'd feel so French and...

08:18.707 --> 08:22.461
All this great writing
that comes from distress.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.422
But it has beauty in it too, you know?

08:25.547 --> 08:27.508
Like, JT certainly had that.

08:27.633 --> 08:31.303
Like, his grandparents
were fundamentalists, super sadistic.

08:34.722 --> 08:38.644
- Hey, let me know what you think.
- Of course. Yeah.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.272
Hello? Hi.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.777
<i>It's my first day on the lot.</i>

08:47.986 --> 08:52.199
<i>I'm wearing the golden Rapunzel wig
bestowed upon me by my mother, Sarah.</i>

08:52.324 --> 08:54.451
<i>The legendary beauty
and fiercest hooker</i>

08:54.576 --> 08:57.162
<i>that ever did work
a truck stop down South.</i>

08:58.372 --> 09:02.084
<i>In her high heels, I strut between
the long shimmering lines of big rigs.</i>

09:02.209 --> 09:04.628
<i>Cash's hand is like
the maw of some big animal</i>

09:04.753 --> 09:08.132
<i>as he opens it
revealing a raccoon penis bone,</i>

09:08.257 --> 09:12.302
<i>the talisman that distinguishes
his asphalt girls from all others.</i>

09:12.428 --> 09:16.765
<i>The bigger the bone, the more in demand
her soft girl material is.</i>

09:16.890 --> 09:19.476
<i>If you didn't notice
the raccoon penis bone necklaces</i>

09:19.601 --> 09:21.228
<i>and you didn't know what that meant,</i>

09:21.353 --> 09:23.897
<i>you'd never know
they were actually boys.</i>

09:24.565 --> 09:25.805
<i>You got to earn that raccoon...</i>

09:25.899 --> 09:30.237
<i>The mob surrounds me, tearing
at my lace, ripping my hard-won finery.</i>

09:30.362 --> 09:31.739
<i>"It's a goddamn boy!" they yell,</i>

09:31.864 --> 09:35.367
<i>hungry jackals baying at the moon
while chasing me through the woods.</i>

09:35.492 --> 09:36.994
<i>This is all I am.</i>

09:37.119 --> 09:40.748
<i>A bloody, glittering heart thumping
under a bruise-black sky,</i>

09:40.873 --> 09:44.084
<i>refusing to let anyone tell me
who I'm supposed to be.</i>

09:54.928 --> 09:58.432
<i>I found it so beautiful. It's crazy.</i>

09:59.433 --> 10:04.271
I've never read anything like it,
and it's really painful, you know,

10:04.396 --> 10:07.775
but, like, fucking magic
and I can't even...

10:08.776 --> 10:10.110
<i>I can't think of the right way</i>

10:10.235 --> 10:12.529
<i>to describe how it makes me feel,
honestly.</i>

10:12.654 --> 10:14.948
Oh, my God!

10:15.073 --> 10:18.118
That's so beautiful
to hear you talk about it that way.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.454
God! Of course you so get it.

10:21.163 --> 10:27.127
<i>I don't know if Geoff told you.
I was in such a dark place, you know?</i>

10:27.252 --> 10:29.880
The soul or spirit
or whatever you wanna call it

10:30.005 --> 10:32.966
just... embodied me.

10:34.009 --> 10:40.599
This Jeremiah Terminator LeRoy.

10:42.518 --> 10:45.354
Jeremiah Terminator LeRoy...

10:46.230 --> 10:47.231
Wow.

10:47.356 --> 10:51.109
<i>Then he started calling this therapist
who told JT,</i>

10:51.235 --> 10:53.695
<i>"Hey, you should write
your story down."</i>

10:54.363 --> 10:58.826
It's kind of amazing
sharing this with you 'cause...

10:59.451 --> 11:03.413
um... when I first saw you,
I thought you looked like him.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.916
- Huh?
- <i>It's why I was just...</i>

11:06.041 --> 11:08.794
I wanted to ask you if I could
take a picture of you as him.

11:09.378 --> 11:11.421
Well, what do you mean? Like...

11:11.547 --> 11:14.258
<i>I've been JT on the phone for years,</i>

11:14.383 --> 11:17.469
<i>and people need to see him now.</i>

11:17.594 --> 11:22.933
I mean, I'm... a girl, you know,
just to state the obvious.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.434
<i>No! No!</i>

11:24.560 --> 11:28.355
That's what's beautiful.
He's androgynous. You know? He's like,

11:28.480 --> 11:34.069
<i>you know, discovering his own identity.
Boy, girl. He's in disguise.</i>

11:34.194 --> 11:36.613
I'd pay you 50 bucks.
It's for <i>Interview</i> magazine.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.366
Sav! <i>Interview</i> magazine.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.993
<i>What do you think?</i>

11:43.829 --> 11:46.415
I mean... Yeah, sure. Why not?

12:22.701 --> 12:24.261
Oh, really? This is what it looks like?

12:24.286 --> 12:25.787
- Yeah.
- Ew.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.749
- Looks great.
- Yeah.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.594
So put your chin down. Perfect.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.930
Little bit to the right.
New just give me eyes though.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.599
A little bit... Perfect.

13:02.032 --> 13:05.494
Oh, my God, I'm getting chills.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.704
- Sav, you look great.
- That's JT.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.540
- It's fucking perfect.
- You don't wanna do one more?

13:10.666 --> 13:13.669
Are you kidding?
These are $12 a box. Let's go!

13:17.047 --> 13:18.423
<i>I did it.</i>

13:18.548 --> 13:23.804
<i>This is a whole new beginning for me.
Like a whole new world.</i>

13:41.989 --> 13:44.533
Here you go. You all good?

13:45.409 --> 13:47.411
That hair looks good on you.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.623
Thank you. I was noticing your shoes.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.168
- I've never seen that.
- Yeah.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.546
Free the toes and the rest will follow.

14:00.590 --> 14:04.011
You've been in here. I've seen you
in here. Do you live nearby?

14:05.345 --> 14:08.390
Pretty close. Mission.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.518
- You?
- Uh, SoMa.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.437
Right.

14:20.444 --> 14:23.238
If you need anything,
I'm gonna be working here

14:23.363 --> 14:26.450
for the rest of the time
you'll be here, so...

14:27.784 --> 14:29.911
- OK.
- OK.

14:42.841 --> 14:43.842
Hello?

14:43.967 --> 14:46.053
<i>Savannah. It's Laura.
Oh, my God, how are you?</i>

14:46.178 --> 14:48.138
<i>Can you do it one more time?</i>

14:50.098 --> 14:52.559
Hey, I'm JT Leroy.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.395
Hey, I'm JT Leroy.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.150
Hey, I'm JT Leroy.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.652
Hey, I'm JT Leroy.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.531
It's great.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.243
I mean, it's one thing taking a photo,

15:10.368 --> 15:13.872
maybe saying like, "Hey, I'm JT Leroy,"
but it's another thing being him.

15:13.997 --> 15:16.225
No, no! First of all,
I did the interview already.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.251
It's not like
he's trying to talk to you.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.711
He just wants to get the picture.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.214
And besides,
when you're meeting someone new,

15:22.339 --> 15:24.466
would you ever question
who they say they are?

15:25.634 --> 15:27.052
It's gonna be perfect. Here.

15:27.177 --> 15:31.014
This is an interview with JT
so you can listen to the voice.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.724
Oh, I've gotta show you.

15:32.849 --> 15:37.187
There's this unbelievably, like,
hot-as-fuck actress,

15:37.312 --> 15:41.274
Eva Avelin, from Europe.
The book is doing really well there.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.151
She's been calling JT every night.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.780
Just, like, obsessing and we're
finishing each other's sentences.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.952
- Whoa.
- Yeah. D'you want a cookie?

15:54.496 --> 15:57.040
No, cookies produce curves.
I can't do it.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.128
What? You can't, like, eat cookies
and be goth?

16:02.003 --> 16:05.257
I'm... I'm not goth.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.092
Just skinny?

16:07.217 --> 16:11.388
No, not necessarily, just no... curves.

16:11.513 --> 16:16.059
Is that why you're, like, binding it up
and wearing sports bras all the time?

16:16.768 --> 16:17.978
That's perfect for JT.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.188
Get rid of the boobs,
you're already there.

16:20.522 --> 16:21.523
Yeah.

16:22.232 --> 16:25.110
<i>Today I'm speaking with JT Leroy,</i>

16:25.235 --> 16:26.778
<i>the young writer of "Sarah",</i>

16:26.903 --> 16:29.614
<i>a best-selling novel
based on his experience</i>

16:29.739 --> 16:34.077
<i>as the son of a prostitute
who worked truck stops in the South.</i>

16:34.202 --> 16:39.082
<i>JT, your mother used to pass you off
as her younger sister?</i>

16:39.207 --> 16:41.334
<i>Yeah. I mean...</i>

16:41.459 --> 16:45.130
<i>Sarah, she knew that johns
didn't like having a boy around,</i>

16:45.255 --> 16:48.258
<i>so she made it two pretty girls.</i>

16:48.383 --> 16:51.303
<i>'Cause she knew
they'd get twice the attention.</i>

16:51.428 --> 16:52.804
Sav, you're cool with this, right?

16:52.929 --> 16:55.974
I mean, you don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.102
Yeah, no, no, totally. I'm into it.

16:59.436 --> 17:03.064
<i>Did your mother expect you
to engage in prostitution?</i>

17:03.190 --> 17:06.151
<i>I mean,
she didn't force me or nothin', but...</i>

17:06.276 --> 17:08.671
- She didn't force me or nothin'.
- <i>Part of me really liked it.</i>

17:08.694 --> 17:10.780
I don't quite understand it
a hundred percent, but...

17:10.906 --> 17:13.992
Yeah, it's... it's... complicated.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.243
- <i>I loved dressing up...</i>
- I loved dressing up...

17:16.368 --> 17:18.622
- <i>Putting on clothes.</i>
- Putting on clothes.

17:18.747 --> 17:21.750
- <i>Turning into someone else.</i>
- Turning into someone else.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.752
<i>Look, Laura is on the phone
all the time as JT,</i>

17:24.877 --> 17:27.589
<i>but she also pretends
to be his manager, Speedie.</i>

17:27.714 --> 17:31.885
- And she deemed me Astor.
- Astor?

17:32.010 --> 17:35.805
Astor's, like, Speedie's boyfriend,
and we saved JT from the streets.

17:35.931 --> 17:38.391
Now we're like this "happy family"
and shit.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.811
<i>My books are fiction.
I mean, I tell stories,</i>

17:41.937 --> 17:45.232
<i>but sometimes the lies
are more true than the truth.</i>

17:45.357 --> 17:46.816
More true than the truth.

17:46.942 --> 17:49.986
Sometimes the lie is more true
than the truth.

17:50.737 --> 17:54.074
<i>Trust me, this whole thing
is crazy for me too.</i>

17:54.199 --> 17:56.243
I mean, didn't expect
to be moving in

17:56.368 --> 18:01.081
with a teenage male prostitute
and an obnoxious, loud British woman.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.000
Obnoxious, loud British woman?

18:04.125 --> 18:06.711
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's... That's Speedie.

18:07.963 --> 18:10.715
Well, 'ello,
you right little bugger.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.968
I thought you weren't gonna show.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.429
Ready for the shoot?
Bruce, this is JT!

18:17.055 --> 18:19.599
- Hi, JT.
- Say 'ello.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.143
Hi.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.858
Yeah. He gets a bit nervous.

18:29.859 --> 18:34.072
And also, by the way,
he don't like to be touched, all right?

18:34.197 --> 18:37.867
So I give you full permission.
Poke around, find your shot,

18:37.993 --> 18:39.661
but, like, in this room.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.248
Hey, JT. I'm so glad
that we could make this work.

18:43.373 --> 18:46.251
- Right.
- I bought this from you online.

18:46.376 --> 18:47.460
Oh!

18:47.585 --> 18:49.879
And I know how much you like chocolate.

18:50.005 --> 18:53.675
What? Nothin' for the handler?
I like it too.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.636
- Great room.
- Great.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.305
My sister's got great taste.

18:58.430 --> 19:02.350
So, JT, why you don't tell me
where you two guys live?

19:05.061 --> 19:06.563
Well, I live in...

19:07.188 --> 19:09.065
- Tenderloin.
- Yeah. Over there.

19:09.190 --> 19:10.650
Oh, cool.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.569
- There we go.
- You know,

19:12.694 --> 19:15.655
if you can get
that Twist & Scream poster in,

19:15.780 --> 19:19.659
that's me sister's band and JT loves it.
You'd like that, right?

19:20.201 --> 19:23.204
I think we need
to loosen up a little bit.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.581
- Oh, loosen up?
- Yeah, we do.

19:24.706 --> 19:29.586
Shake up them muscles, little lovey.
You like that?

19:29.711 --> 19:32.255
Great. Great. I got an idea.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.548
Why don't you, um...

19:36.009 --> 19:37.635
just try standing on this?

19:41.139 --> 19:44.726
I'm not really a skater,
so it's kinda weird.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.561
OK, how about...

19:46.686 --> 19:48.313
You know what? Wait.

19:48.438 --> 19:49.439
Um...

19:50.231 --> 19:53.777
I've got... JT loves makeup.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.404
What about lipstick? Right?

19:56.529 --> 19:59.699
You wanna put some lipstick on, love?
In the mirror?

19:59.824 --> 20:02.577
- It could be good, right?
- Let's try it. We can get right...

20:03.161 --> 20:05.413
This is nice.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.915
Do you like it?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.918
- Good. Really nice. Slowly.
- Nice!

20:10.043 --> 20:13.046
- Apply it slowly to your face.
- I'm worried that that skateboard...

20:13.171 --> 20:14.214
Lean into the mirror.

20:14.339 --> 20:17.175
- Speedie, you're in the shot.
- Oh. Sorry.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.219
Come out. Come on out. Good.

20:19.344 --> 20:22.055
Beautiful, JT. Beautiful.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.057
- Beautiful.
- Shit.

20:24.182 --> 20:26.059
- Beautiful.
- It's all right.

20:26.184 --> 20:28.269
- I'm just gonna take a leak.
- OK.

20:30.897 --> 20:36.569
- Yeah, I think he's done.
- Ooh, I just... I only shot one roll.

20:36.694 --> 20:39.447
No, no, you don't know how fortunate
you are to get the shot at all.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.657
I understand that.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.782
You're the first person
who's ever taken his photo.

20:42.867 --> 20:43.868
Thank you.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.553
He's been in the house
for three months.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.747
But my editor's gonna want
more than one shot.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.375
- I know, but he's delicate.
- Hey, JT.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.421
What do you say
we do a couple more, huh?

20:55.296 --> 20:56.381
Um...

20:58.133 --> 20:59.926
JT, you...

21:00.885 --> 21:04.055
Yeah, nah, I think we're done, Bruce.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.224
Thank you for understanding.

21:06.349 --> 21:10.437
But I bet you got a great shot, right?

21:10.562 --> 21:12.730
- Thank you, JT, for your time.
- Yeah, thanks.

21:12.856 --> 21:15.042
- It was a real pleasure.
- You did great.

21:15.066 --> 21:19.070
- Speedie?
- All right, thank you, Bruce.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.866
- Thank you.
- I'm sure it will be great.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.827
- And we'll see the shots soon.
- OK. Great.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.620
All right then.

21:36.671 --> 21:38.798
- You were fuckin' great!
- Disaster vibes.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.176
- You were great!
- Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.343
Sorry?

21:42.469 --> 21:44.721
- What are you talking about?
- I can't do that accent.

21:44.846 --> 21:47.599
He could so see that I was a girl.
I could see him looking at me.

21:47.724 --> 21:51.311
Not at all. He never suspected anything.
It was the opposite.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.688
He wanted you to go home with him.

21:53.813 --> 21:58.318
Fuck, you were great.
And playing Speedie was so cool, right?

21:58.443 --> 22:00.653
Like, not giving a fuck
what anybody thinks of you,

22:00.778 --> 22:03.698
you just say whatever the fuck's
on your mind! I love 'er!

22:03.823 --> 22:06.701
What about when you answered every
question for me? It was so obvious.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.828
No, that's so JT. He's nervous.

22:08.953 --> 22:11.456
He can't speak for himself.
That was perfect.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.584
Oh, Sav, trust me.

22:14.709 --> 22:17.003
I learned about this
from my phone sex days.

22:17.128 --> 22:19.839
You establish yourself
as someone else, right?

22:19.964 --> 22:24.010
You can do that. Then drop the accent
and nobody even notices.

22:24.886 --> 22:29.432
And he's elusive. That's the mystery
and people love mystery.

22:29.557 --> 22:32.143
I almost puked when I walked in.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.438
Oh, that's so JT.
That was what was so perfect.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.942
He looked nauseous
and nervous and awkward.

22:39.067 --> 22:42.946
Oh, my God, on Friday night,
we've got the reading

22:43.071 --> 22:45.323
and there are all these fabulous people
that will show up

22:45.448 --> 22:47.492
and read for him
'cause he's never there.

22:47.617 --> 22:50.745
What if you just showed up
and just, like, hyperventilate?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.789
- No way.
- Run out like you're gonna throw up?

22:52.914 --> 22:55.041
- No way.
- Yes way!

22:55.166 --> 22:57.627
I can't. It was sickening.

22:57.752 --> 23:01.130
That's that feeling.
That's what's so beautiful.

23:01.256 --> 23:04.801
It's that feeling we all get, like,
right before we do something important.

23:14.185 --> 23:17.397
You know what? Don't worry about it.

23:17.522 --> 23:18.940
I can get somebody else next time.

23:19.482 --> 23:22.235
I gotta go 'cause Geoff and I
have band practice.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.321
Shit. I'm late.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.865
I'm just gonna go like this.
OK, Sav. Here.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.200
Oh, thanks. I...

23:29.325 --> 23:33.079
As promised, love.
Thank you, ta very much.

23:33.997 --> 23:36.457
- Oh, my God, that was so fun.
- See ya.

23:44.924 --> 23:48.553
Thank you.
JT actually isn't feeling well,

23:48.678 --> 23:52.473
so I'm sorry to say
he won't be joining us after all.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.563
Told you. This is some sort of hoax.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.148
Right?

25:16.516 --> 25:17.558
Hello?

25:17.684 --> 25:20.603
<i>Sav. Can you come over tonight?
I have big news.</i>

25:21.312 --> 25:23.106
My God! Get in here.

25:23.231 --> 25:25.942
You're not gonna believe
what I'm gonna tell you. Are you ready?

25:26.067 --> 25:29.904
A Hollywood producer
wants to make Sarah into a movie.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.157
- What? No way. Are you serious?
- Can you imagine?

25:33.700 --> 25:36.285
Sarah on the big screen?

25:37.453 --> 25:39.247
Yeah, yeah. That'd be epic.

25:39.372 --> 25:42.250
JT can do his thing
and say, you know,

25:42.375 --> 25:46.546
hey, I'm an agoraphobe who just wants
his autonomy respected, but...

25:47.630 --> 25:50.550
I don't think so.
I think this is too big an opportunity.

25:54.429 --> 25:56.639
You... us... tonight?

25:56.764 --> 26:01.060
No, no, silly. This weekend. In LA.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.271
We'd stay at her house.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.690
There's a party, a reading,
a photo shoot.

26:05.815 --> 26:08.151
Come on, it'll be fun.

26:08.276 --> 26:10.611
No, just 'cause I...
I'm working this weekend.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.405
That's... That's the only thing.

26:14.157 --> 26:15.575
Sweet girl.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.828
I know the photo shoot was intense.

26:19.287 --> 26:21.414
Right? It was a lot.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.960
But, Sav, there was a light in you.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.046
And I...

26:29.172 --> 26:34.635
I felt him leave my body
and enter yours.

26:39.557 --> 26:45.897
I mean, I was in high school when,
I don't know, he was turning tricks.

26:47.732 --> 26:50.943
Am I interesting enough to, like,
be him?

26:51.068 --> 26:52.278
What?

26:52.403 --> 26:55.990
You are interesting.
Are you kidding me? Sav.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.618
You're incredible.

26:58.743 --> 27:02.330
I don't hate myself, I just...
That's so different.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.457
I think you gotta think about this
differently.

27:05.082 --> 27:09.754
I mean, we're talking Warhol,
Ziggy Stardust, Grace Jones.

27:10.463 --> 27:13.143
What if you wake up one morning
and say, "I wanna be somebody else?"

27:13.216 --> 27:16.177
That's what they did.
They didn't wait for permission.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.305
Well, yeah, I... I know that feeling.

27:21.182 --> 27:23.518
I knew I wanted to be an artist,
right?

27:24.769 --> 27:27.522
'Cause I was like, I wanna have a life.

27:27.647 --> 27:31.567
I don't wanna live in a fuckin' cubicle
nine to fucking five.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.778
That's not who I am.

27:34.529 --> 27:37.281
Fine! Fine! Spend my life,
"Hello, hi. Wanna fuck?"

27:37.406 --> 27:39.450
Doing phone sex for the rest of my life?

27:39.575 --> 27:41.494
No. I'm a writer.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.915
I spent my twenties and thirties
waiting for somebody to discover me,

27:46.040 --> 27:49.043
somebody to give me permission?

27:49.710 --> 27:51.462
Nobody gives you anything.

27:51.587 --> 27:52.839
You have to take it.

27:54.382 --> 27:55.925
Are you gonna take it?

27:58.594 --> 28:01.597
You've got all these selves
inside of you. Explore them.

28:01.722 --> 28:04.851
This is your time.
Find out who the fuck you are.

28:15.528 --> 28:17.280
- Oh, shit.
- Are we out of chips?

28:17.405 --> 28:18.781
We ate three bags of chips?

28:19.615 --> 28:21.409
I'm gonna be sweating potato chips.

28:21.534 --> 28:25.413
Don't worry. No food tomorrow,
but we need the sweet with the salty.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.748
- I don't.
- Secret stash.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.376
- Chocolate.
- I'm OK.

28:31.252 --> 28:32.295
- Yeah?
- Uh-uh.

28:35.256 --> 28:38.718
- Tell me about this boy.
- Sean? What about him?

28:38.843 --> 28:41.929
Well, you date men?

28:43.389 --> 28:47.560
Sometimes.
If they're as cute as he is, I do.

28:47.685 --> 28:50.021
But I'm open. I like girls, obviously.

28:51.022 --> 28:53.691
I can't go to any more dyke nights.
It makes me so uncomfortable.

28:53.816 --> 28:56.569
It's so embarrassing.
The music's so awful.

28:56.694 --> 28:59.739
Did Geoff ever tell you I pretended
to be a dyke when we first met?

28:59.864 --> 29:02.033
No. Why?

29:02.158 --> 29:05.620
Because...
he was just so good-looking.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.081
You know, I wanted to know
if he liked me for me.

29:09.707 --> 29:10.958
Ah.

29:11.626 --> 29:14.503
Test the waters
and not be the fat girl swooning.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.380
Hey.

29:16.505 --> 29:21.052
I was a hundred pounds fatter
than I am now.

29:21.886 --> 29:24.305
Oh. I didn't realize that.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.391
Good thing
I'm not terrified of the knife.

29:29.727 --> 29:31.646
But I've been with women before.

29:32.355 --> 29:34.023
Especially in the group home.

29:35.066 --> 29:36.317
How was that?

29:37.777 --> 29:39.278
Sex was amazing.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.614
No, I mean the group home.

29:42.323 --> 29:43.991
Oh.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.159
Rough.

29:46.744 --> 29:49.163
But it gave me the tough skin I live in.

29:51.999 --> 29:56.087
You know I used to sneak out at night
and call suicide hotlines for help,

29:56.212 --> 30:00.049
and I could never... be me.

30:01.884 --> 30:04.720
I'd create characters, usually boys.

30:06.597 --> 30:09.183
Some of them didn't make it, but JT...

30:11.519 --> 30:13.312
JT kept calling.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.526
And it felt so good
to not have to be in this body.

30:19.402 --> 30:22.530
You know?
To be as far away from it as possible.

30:25.199 --> 30:26.325
I get that.

30:57.940 --> 30:58.941
JT!

30:59.066 --> 31:00.443
Oh, my God!

31:01.235 --> 31:02.361
JT!

31:03.738 --> 31:06.365
Oh, my God,
it's so good to finally meet you.

31:07.366 --> 31:10.995
- This is amazing!
- Right?

31:11.120 --> 31:14.373
JT, keep writing them books.
Maybe you'll get a house like this.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.792
Oh, no, JT,
the real money's in screenwriting.

31:16.917 --> 31:20.046
You should write me a part. A cool part.
I could play a lot lizard.

31:20.171 --> 31:24.383
- Oh. You already got an actor.
- The guest bedroom's this way.

31:24.967 --> 31:28.095
I don't think
we've been in a guest room.

31:28.888 --> 31:29.930
It's amazing.

31:30.056 --> 31:33.225
- Oh, my God, what a house.
- Thank you.

31:33.851 --> 31:37.980
Oh, and JT brought you
a little prezzie.

31:38.105 --> 31:39.148
Ah.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.525
Not really from Neiman Marcus.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.904
I stole that bag out of
my neighbor's recycling, but...

31:47.948 --> 31:51.285
Oh, little mini onions. How cute.

31:52.453 --> 31:53.621
And...

31:53.746 --> 31:55.915
baked beans.

31:57.500 --> 32:01.045
- Oh, God. I've needed one of these.
- Those are great, right?

32:04.548 --> 32:08.052
I love that
you're quite good at that.

32:08.177 --> 32:10.471
That's all I'm gonna say.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.059
Oh!

32:15.184 --> 32:19.980
And JT wrote all the lyrics
to our band's songs, Twist & Scream.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.441
Thought you'd love it.

32:22.566 --> 32:24.026
Oh, that's so cool.

32:24.735 --> 32:26.946
JT, did you get that book I sent you?

32:29.532 --> 32:30.699
Yeah, we loved it.

32:31.075 --> 32:32.868
Yeah, yeah. It's real good.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.872
JT, what are you wearing?

32:39.416 --> 32:41.335
What... What is going on?

32:41.460 --> 32:43.712
What's happening to all the money?

32:44.880 --> 32:47.216
There's not much money though yet.

32:49.176 --> 32:51.470
Why do you keep answering for him?

32:54.473 --> 32:57.434
He's a deaf mute.

32:58.769 --> 33:02.565
That's the way it feels
because he hates talking about money,

33:02.690 --> 33:04.233
hates business talk.

33:04.358 --> 33:07.695
You know, it's like art, art, art.
Keep it pure.

33:07.820 --> 33:11.031
I mean, we're two orphans, fuck,
who found each other.

33:11.157 --> 33:14.201
I don't know these things either,
so you're right. That's great advice.

33:14.326 --> 33:18.497
We need a guide, you know.
I'll get someone.

33:19.915 --> 33:22.084
OK, all right, Oliver Twist.

33:25.880 --> 33:26.922
Come on.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.092
Hi, David.

33:30.217 --> 33:34.054
Oh, my God. JT, listen to this.
Trying to emulate the icons.

33:34.180 --> 33:37.183
If I have to talk
to all of JT's friends as JT...

33:37.308 --> 33:39.602
We work off each other. You're perfect.

33:39.727 --> 33:41.270
<i>Totally trust yourself.</i>

33:43.981 --> 33:45.149
JT, are you OK?

33:45.274 --> 33:49.111
JT's a genius and Sav's a genius.
Don't you ever forget that.

33:50.487 --> 33:52.323
The bacon-wrapped dates are amazing.

33:52.448 --> 33:53.866
Oh, we don't eat pork.

33:54.742 --> 33:56.342
Well, I was just being polite, but yeah.

33:56.452 --> 33:58.704
If you don't understand a reference,
just go with it.

33:58.829 --> 34:00.414
Do what I do. Hang a lantern on it.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.957
What is... what is that?

34:02.082 --> 34:04.682
You're so funny with the sunglasses, JT.
D'you ever take them off?

34:04.710 --> 34:07.004
It means if it's obvious,
make it more obvious.

34:07.129 --> 34:10.007
Let 'em see these beauties.

34:10.132 --> 34:11.507
Your eyes are so beautiful.

34:11.634 --> 34:13.552
<i>It's like those Chinese finger puzzles.</i>

34:13.677 --> 34:15.763
You go in further to get out.

34:15.888 --> 34:19.099
Baby, we're at play
in the fields of the Lord.

34:23.103 --> 34:26.940
Look, there's Eva Avelin.
She's dying to do <i>Sarah.</i>

34:27.065 --> 34:28.609
To direct and star in it.

34:31.527 --> 34:35.032
JT? Hi. John Bradwell.

34:35.157 --> 34:37.451
- We loved the piece you did on JT.
- Oh.

34:37.576 --> 34:40.536
- Thoughtful, investigative.
- Wow.

34:40.663 --> 34:43.873
- Really a great piece.
- Thank you. Thank you.

34:44.875 --> 34:48.003
Um, I'm still living in San Francisco,

34:48.128 --> 34:51.257
so if you wanted to meet up
and continue that conversation...

34:51.382 --> 34:52.507
Yeah, definitely.

34:52.632 --> 34:55.010
- I'm just gonna grab...
- Right.

34:55.886 --> 34:56.929
OK.

35:02.726 --> 35:03.978
JT.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.897
Oh, Eva. Hey.

35:09.066 --> 35:10.401
<i>Enfant.</i>

35:13.279 --> 35:15.239
You are here at last.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.993
Um, I'm here, pretty sure.

35:19.660 --> 35:21.954
How's the snail story coming along?

35:22.579 --> 35:24.498
- Good.
- Excuse me one second.

35:25.124 --> 35:27.376
Does the snail still have
a <i>visage brute?</i>

35:28.002 --> 35:31.630
- Um...
- <i>Visage brute?</i> Sorry, I'm Speedie.

35:32.256 --> 35:33.966
JT was just tellin' me about that.

35:34.091 --> 35:37.136
"Ugly face" or somethin'. I love it!

35:37.803 --> 35:39.972
- Just give us a minute?
- Like a title...

35:40.097 --> 35:41.515
Oh, sure.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.183
Are you staying here?

35:43.559 --> 35:46.770
Um, hm-hmm. I'm just in that room there.

35:46.895 --> 35:50.316
OK, cool. I'm just kinda worried
about you staying at some hotel,

35:50.441 --> 35:52.151
running off and getting into trouble.

35:53.694 --> 35:56.196
I don't really get
in that kind of trouble anymore.

35:56.322 --> 35:57.323
Hm-hmm.

35:57.448 --> 35:59.742
You have trouble written all over you.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.662
Oh, my God. You are so fucking cute.

36:03.787 --> 36:06.081
Why are you so shy?
Soak up the attention.

36:06.206 --> 36:09.585
- Everybody's here for you.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

36:10.294 --> 36:11.879
Eva!

36:15.424 --> 36:16.425
All right.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.802
- Find me at the bar?
- OK.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.012
OK.

36:22.097 --> 36:25.434
Oh, hey, Eva, is... are you gonna be
at the reading tomorrow?

36:26.101 --> 36:29.229
Baby, what are you talking about?
I'm one of the readers.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.273
Oh, yeah.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.817
Well, I was... I was thinkin'...

36:35.694 --> 36:36.820
Fuck.

36:47.081 --> 36:48.207
Perfect.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.501
Nice. Just shake it out.

36:51.001 --> 36:52.544
There we go.

36:52.669 --> 36:53.921
Look at that.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.048
Up a little bit.

37:30.499 --> 37:31.500
JT!

37:32.376 --> 37:35.671
So sorry to bother you. I, um...

37:36.255 --> 37:39.216
I just wanted to tell you
how much your work means to me.

37:39.675 --> 37:42.553
I was on the streets for a while too.

37:42.678 --> 37:46.682
When I read your book,
I was like, someone gets me.

37:48.225 --> 37:50.394
Your voice means a lot.

37:51.979 --> 37:53.105
Thank you.

37:55.649 --> 37:57.693
Do you see that? Huh?

37:58.986 --> 38:01.738
Your work, you're helping people.
It's beautiful.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.500
Thank you.

38:16.587 --> 38:17.629
It looks nice.

38:18.755 --> 38:20.340
Come to Paris. OK?

38:22.551 --> 38:23.719
JT?

38:24.595 --> 38:25.804
JT!

38:29.725 --> 38:30.976
<i>Au revoir.</i>

38:44.531 --> 38:47.451
<i>I feel alive
for the first time in my life.</i>

38:50.496 --> 38:52.289
<i>Sav, you're never gonna believe this.</i>

38:52.956 --> 38:57.211
<i>JT's French publishers are flying us
to Paris for a press conference.</i>

38:57.336 --> 38:58.754
Holy fucking shit.

38:59.755 --> 39:02.633
Get the fuck out of here.
I can't believe this is happening.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.886
<i>And Eva's throwing the after party.</i>

39:06.887 --> 39:09.848
OK, I kinda gotta go. I'll talk to you.
I'll call you tomorrow.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.350
<i>OK, bye.</i>

39:17.773 --> 39:20.025
- You're making us headbands?
- Yeah.

39:20.150 --> 39:21.902
- Cute.
- Thanks.

39:28.283 --> 39:32.079
So I have to go to Paris
in, like, two weeks.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.998
- Shit.
- Yeah.

39:35.123 --> 39:37.751
Wow. That's... What... What for?

39:38.460 --> 39:40.379
Um, Laura has some work there,

39:40.504 --> 39:43.549
so I'm gonna go assist her.
She needs some help.

39:44.174 --> 39:46.176
- That's so cool.
- Yeah.

39:46.301 --> 39:47.461
- Have you ever been?
- Uh-uh.

39:47.553 --> 39:48.679
- No?
- Uh-uh.

39:48.804 --> 39:50.639
- Have you?
- I wish.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.225
Well, where's my invite?

39:55.561 --> 39:57.229
You wanna fit in my backpack?

39:57.354 --> 39:59.314
- You can come.
- Oh.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.234
I can fit in very small places.

40:08.740 --> 40:09.866
I'll miss you.

40:12.536 --> 40:13.870
Yeah, I'll miss you too.

40:14.663 --> 40:15.789
<i>Eva...</i>

40:16.665 --> 40:19.001
<i>You haven't taken it off? Really?</i>

40:19.126 --> 40:22.212
I love that. You know I can't stop.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.715
You got my bone around your neck.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.800
But you started it.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.137
I can't wait to see you again too.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.973
OK. All right. Call me right back.

40:37.436 --> 40:40.314
They sent enough money
for first-class tickets.

40:41.481 --> 40:43.233
I mean, we'll go coach
and pocket the rest,

40:43.358 --> 40:47.529
but I tried to get another ticket
for Astor and they just won't budge,

40:47.654 --> 40:51.283
so I figured we'll just buy one if...

40:51.408 --> 40:53.619
Yeah, why would I wanna go to Europe?

40:53.744 --> 40:56.079
We have a recording session next week.

40:56.204 --> 40:59.166
We have a recording session next week.

40:59.291 --> 41:00.667
I know, babe.

41:00.792 --> 41:05.589
I figured we'd move it and it'd give you
a little more time to work on the music,

41:05.714 --> 41:10.052
refine things. I mean, we're gonna be
just jamming through that press.

41:10.177 --> 41:13.889
It'll be a nightmare and I know you hate
that whole world anyways, so...

41:14.014 --> 41:16.850
Yeah, I don't exactly wanna be
the caboose on the JT train,

41:16.975 --> 41:20.562
but, Laura, we're in a band, you know?

41:21.188 --> 41:23.774
Like, that's our pack.
It's a band, it's a bond.

41:23.899 --> 41:29.071
Hey. What do we always say?
By any means...

41:29.196 --> 41:33.492
Necessary. Yeah, for the band.
You know, for the music.

41:33.617 --> 41:36.578
- It <i>is</i> for the music.
- How is this for the music?

41:36.703 --> 41:39.748
Babe! JT's gonna plug the shit
out of this band.

41:39.873 --> 41:41.500
Are you kidding?

41:41.625 --> 41:43.960
It's massive worldwide press.

41:44.086 --> 41:48.382
And I'm, like, this close
to getting us a review in Spin.

41:49.758 --> 41:50.801
I mean,

41:50.926 --> 41:53.261
Madonna sent us Kabbalah books.

41:53.887 --> 41:57.057
Madonna is in our world!

41:57.474 --> 41:59.810
Yeah, that's great, Laura.
No, really great.

42:00.477 --> 42:02.562
What world are you in?

42:02.979 --> 42:04.272
Eva...

42:04.648 --> 42:05.941
Yeah.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.778
Yeah, I've gotta have creative control.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.030
It's my life.

42:13.824 --> 42:15.826
I'm the only one who knows the truth.

42:15.951 --> 42:19.413
Look, I get it. You wanna go to Europe,
you know? It's cool.

42:23.083 --> 42:24.418
Of course.

42:24.793 --> 42:27.462
I mean, the only thing is,

42:27.587 --> 42:29.868
you don't think what we're doing
is totally fucked, right?

42:33.301 --> 42:34.928
No, no. I mean...

42:35.846 --> 42:37.139
No, right?

42:38.765 --> 42:40.767
I mean I guess technically it's lying.

42:40.892 --> 42:44.187
Like, on paper,
we're... lying to people,

42:44.312 --> 42:46.440
but I feel like...

42:48.275 --> 42:50.235
It feels like I'm making something.

42:50.360 --> 42:55.782
It feels like a performance,
and I'm so compelled to do it, I...

42:57.242 --> 42:59.703
I love that feeling,
I've wanted that feeling forever,

42:59.828 --> 43:02.548
and I never knew really what was gonna,
like, give me that, you know?

43:02.581 --> 43:05.021
You have it. You play guitar,
you've played since you were 12.

43:05.125 --> 43:07.502
I see your face when you do it, like...

43:07.627 --> 43:09.796
It's that feeling.

43:12.340 --> 43:18.638
I guess I'm really good at pretending
to be a feral 19-year-old street kid.

43:18.764 --> 43:20.557
That's not weird, right?

43:22.184 --> 43:23.185
No.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.021
Oh, man.

44:04.768 --> 44:05.769
Welcome.

44:07.229 --> 44:09.481
How was your flight? All right?

44:10.148 --> 44:11.775
JT's hungry.

44:12.067 --> 44:14.611
<i>Vraiment?</i> You did not indulge
in the first-class fare?

44:14.736 --> 44:18.198
Bugger slept the whole flight.
Maybe some eggs.

44:18.990 --> 44:20.510
We don't have much time.

44:20.617 --> 44:22.744
He loves eggs, so if we can grab...

44:23.411 --> 44:26.373
First time in Paris? <i>Voilà.</i>

44:27.499 --> 44:30.377
Fucking take my... Fuckin' French.

44:41.012 --> 44:44.266
Quite mature trees, aren't they?

44:46.059 --> 44:48.603
You never see that in America.

44:49.604 --> 44:50.939
It's gorgeous.

44:51.606 --> 44:55.318
Europe, I love it. You know?
It's fantastic.

44:56.027 --> 44:57.028
I'm gonna barf.

44:57.153 --> 45:00.782
I can't believe they wouldn't
stop for eggs. I can't live off snacks.

45:00.907 --> 45:03.910
You need to be my advocate
and speak up or we'll never eat.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.036
Sorry.

45:05.161 --> 45:08.498
You'll have to take the jacket off too.
We gotta see the whole band name.

45:08.623 --> 45:10.542
- You can see it.
- No, it's promotion.

45:10.667 --> 45:12.168
- It's good for Geoff.
- JT?

45:13.044 --> 45:14.421
Ah.

45:15.964 --> 45:17.465
Hello!

45:18.633 --> 45:19.885
Hi.

45:20.010 --> 45:21.553
- Hey, Speedie.
- Hey, Eva.

45:21.678 --> 45:25.223
- You look gorgeous as usual.
- How are you?

45:25.348 --> 45:27.642
- What's up? You nervous?
- Yeah, of course.

45:27.767 --> 45:31.354
Don't be. You look great.
I love your jacket. Hey!

45:31.479 --> 45:34.566
You're gonna be fuckin' great.
I'm so proud of you, baby.

45:35.734 --> 45:37.527
I have something for you.

45:44.534 --> 45:47.329
All right. Should we...? You know what?

45:47.454 --> 45:51.666
I think it's best I come with you
so that we can check the venue and...

45:56.296 --> 45:58.173
So you gave me your talisman.

46:01.426 --> 46:02.928
I'm gonna give you mine.

46:05.889 --> 46:07.641
It belonged to my grandfather.

46:11.853 --> 46:15.106
Oh... Oh, it's incredible.

46:15.231 --> 46:18.693
- I shouldn't accept that. You know...
- Yes, you should.

46:31.998 --> 46:35.418
We have to go.

46:44.719 --> 46:46.471
JT LeRoy.

46:51.768 --> 46:53.561
JT!

47:08.576 --> 47:09.869
Hi.

47:14.249 --> 47:17.377
Oui?

47:24.342 --> 47:27.554
Your mother put you through
some awful situations.

47:27.679 --> 47:30.306
How does she feel
about your exposé of her behavior?

47:31.433 --> 47:32.475
Um...

47:34.227 --> 47:35.520
She's not...

47:36.813 --> 47:38.565
with us anymore,

47:39.524 --> 47:42.652
so I don't really know.

47:42.777 --> 47:44.320
We cannot hear you, JT!

47:45.321 --> 47:46.781
You can't hear me? Um...

47:46.906 --> 47:49.576
I...

47:51.119 --> 47:53.079
I was just sayin' that, um...

47:54.706 --> 47:59.711
my... my mom isn't here anymore, and...

48:00.628 --> 48:04.591
Also the books are fiction, so, yeah.

48:10.764 --> 48:12.307
JT?

48:14.225 --> 48:16.895
You wrote on your website
that writing is your lifesaver.

48:17.020 --> 48:20.065
It's painful but I need it.

48:20.190 --> 48:24.069
- What do your friends think?
- The truth in fiction...

48:24.194 --> 48:27.322
JT, why do you
tend to avoid public events?

48:27.447 --> 48:29.532
Protection, I think, and...

48:31.117 --> 48:35.121
Speak to your choice of wearing
a quote unquote "disguise."

48:35.246 --> 48:38.583
Anonymity's kinda like
losing your virginity.

48:38.708 --> 48:41.252
They are based on your real experiences,
right, JT?

48:41.377 --> 48:46.299
Fiction's sort of a lie,
but can be more true than the truth.

48:47.759 --> 48:52.263
JT, you sound like a woman to me,
but you insist you are a man.

48:58.186 --> 48:59.437
Uh...

49:00.772 --> 49:03.650
You know,
it's not really my responsibility

49:03.775 --> 49:11.032
to help lead you through your own
discomfort on how I make you feel.

49:13.243 --> 49:17.247
- I can be whomever I wanna be.
- Fuck, yeah!

49:19.457 --> 49:22.585
And as for sounding like a woman, um,

49:22.710 --> 49:24.879
well, I'd say thank you.

49:26.840 --> 49:27.924
But, JT,

49:28.049 --> 49:30.552
are you really who you say you are?

49:30.677 --> 49:33.429
Are you really who you say you are?

49:36.432 --> 49:37.475
I...

49:38.268 --> 49:40.186
I can't really tell. Are you a man?

49:41.312 --> 49:44.399
Prove your masculinity right now.
Pull your cock out.

49:56.077 --> 49:58.663
All right, it's done.

49:58.788 --> 50:00.790
It's done.

50:01.916 --> 50:03.459
It's done.

50:08.882 --> 50:10.175
<i>Merci.</i>

50:11.551 --> 50:14.304
- You know what I mean? That's the key.
- Hold on a second.

50:14.429 --> 50:16.890
In America it's different.

50:18.266 --> 50:19.809
In America...

50:19.934 --> 50:21.769
You handled that so well, baby.

50:23.646 --> 50:25.190
Super cool...

50:32.655 --> 50:36.659
JT? This young man
would love for you to sign his book.

50:38.494 --> 50:39.537
<i>Bonjour, JT.</i>

50:39.996 --> 50:41.998
Eva... Eva.

50:44.834 --> 50:45.835
Eva.

50:48.421 --> 50:51.966
I need to take JT back to the hotel now.
We need a proper meal.

50:52.091 --> 50:54.260
- Nonsense.
- Nah, he's drinking too much.

50:54.385 --> 50:56.638
And I can't stand all this smoke.

50:57.555 --> 50:59.766
Speedie, come on.

50:59.891 --> 51:02.393
Stop interfering with his life
all the time.

51:04.229 --> 51:07.148
She's interfering with my life,
actually.

51:08.066 --> 51:09.525
Excuse me.

51:11.611 --> 51:12.862
JT.

51:12.987 --> 51:16.658
- Let's go back to the hotel.
- I'm not ready to go yet.

51:17.325 --> 51:21.162
Well, this place is
filled with toxicity. Let's go.

51:22.580 --> 51:24.958
At play in the fields of the Lord,
remember?

51:26.918 --> 51:28.169
My words.

51:29.045 --> 51:30.713
See you later, Speedie.

51:48.815 --> 51:49.816
Ennio!

51:51.609 --> 51:53.111
This look is everything!

52:05.540 --> 52:08.334
Oh, man! It's our favorite song.

52:08.876 --> 52:10.295
Oh, right.

52:11.838 --> 52:12.964
Sorry.

52:17.093 --> 52:18.386
What's up, JT?

52:19.429 --> 52:20.930
Where are you?

52:22.890 --> 52:23.975
I'm...

52:26.686 --> 52:30.023
I'm totally right here. I'm just...

52:31.524 --> 52:33.443
I'm just tired, you know?

52:49.167 --> 52:50.293
Hi.

52:53.004 --> 52:54.130
Hi.

52:57.467 --> 53:00.094
You have a very different vibe
than on the phone.

53:03.056 --> 53:04.390
Yeah, I'm...

53:05.975 --> 53:07.393
so jetlagged.

53:13.691 --> 53:16.069
What's the deal
with you and Speedie? Huh?

53:17.779 --> 53:20.990
I mean, you barely give each other
room to breathe.

53:22.617 --> 53:24.243
She's so obnoxious.

53:26.704 --> 53:29.248
I know she's your friend.
I'm sorry, but...

53:30.875 --> 53:34.295
No, it seems weird from the outside.

53:34.420 --> 53:35.546
Um...

53:38.216 --> 53:40.468
But I wouldn't even exist without her.

53:43.054 --> 53:44.055
What?

53:51.187 --> 53:53.147
I don't really wanna go there, but...

53:55.483 --> 53:58.403
where are we
with the option for the film?

54:00.988 --> 54:02.365
Um...

54:03.699 --> 54:06.911
I just, you know,
I'd be so fuckin' honored to direct it,

54:07.036 --> 54:09.580
and play your mother.

54:12.250 --> 54:16.170
You know, she's such a character
obsessed with her own downfall.

54:16.295 --> 54:19.382
I've always just related
to that kind of woman, you know?

54:20.800 --> 54:23.469
And I really think it's important
to show how...

54:23.594 --> 54:26.139
how you absorbed her pain, you know?

54:26.264 --> 54:28.307
I wanna do it justice.

54:35.773 --> 54:38.818
I'd probably need, like,
full control of the script.

54:40.403 --> 54:42.780
You know, 'cause it's my life, but...

54:49.787 --> 54:50.830
Deal.

55:01.591 --> 55:03.092
You're so beautiful.

55:39.545 --> 55:41.214
Oh, shit!

55:47.803 --> 55:48.804
Oh, baby.

56:09.033 --> 56:11.536
Oh.

56:12.411 --> 56:15.164
It's the famous JT!

56:16.541 --> 56:18.709
So, JT LeRoy, tell me.

56:20.044 --> 56:25.216
How do you have time to write
your amazing best-selling books, huh?

56:25.591 --> 56:28.970
Because it seems like
you just stay out all night partying.

56:29.095 --> 56:32.598
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know.

56:33.891 --> 56:35.560
What were you doing?

56:37.103 --> 56:38.604
I thought it was earlier.

56:38.729 --> 56:42.775
You can't go out so long without me,
and you're drinking.

56:42.900 --> 56:46.487
Who knows what you said.
The whole thing could have fallen apart.

56:47.280 --> 56:51.492
I secured full creative control
over the script, so... there's that.

56:52.952 --> 56:55.538
- What?
- Yeah.

56:59.834 --> 57:01.836
Well, I didn't ask you to do that.

57:03.588 --> 57:04.755
But, I...

57:06.007 --> 57:07.675
I mean that's good news.

57:10.678 --> 57:12.972
What did she say?
I mean, how did that go?

57:13.097 --> 57:15.537
I need to know everything.
I gotta get on the phone right away

57:15.641 --> 57:18.311
and make sure
she said what she meant and...

57:18.436 --> 57:20.646
I'd love to know
what you talk about on the phone.

57:21.188 --> 57:23.065
If I knew
what you talked about on the phone,

57:23.190 --> 57:26.193
maybe I wouldn't sound like
a stammering idiot around her.

57:26.319 --> 57:29.447
I need more to talk about
than stuff I read in interviews.

57:29.572 --> 57:30.865
I want her to feel...

57:33.534 --> 57:34.994
like...

57:36.537 --> 57:38.205
Oh, my God.

57:39.874 --> 57:41.459
Did you fuck her?

57:42.960 --> 57:44.086
I...

57:44.211 --> 57:48.382
It's a Chinese finger puzzle, right?
You go further in to get out?

57:49.258 --> 57:52.553
Fuck! Savy. Goddamn it!

57:52.678 --> 57:54.263
It's not as bad as you think, honestly.

57:54.388 --> 57:56.766
- It's not even like that.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

57:57.224 --> 58:01.604
Baby girl, she doesn't want you.

58:02.229 --> 58:06.734
OK? She wants the person
she talked to on the phone.

58:07.151 --> 58:09.153
She wants JT.

58:09.362 --> 58:12.239
In fact, she doesn't even want that.

58:12.365 --> 58:14.700
She wants the fucking rights
to the movie!

58:20.206 --> 58:22.208
Oh, I'm being mean.

58:24.377 --> 58:27.046
I just hate myself. I binged all night.

58:28.130 --> 58:30.132
I was worried.

58:30.966 --> 58:35.721
I need you here to keep me on track.
I just... Oh, God.

58:36.389 --> 58:37.515
Damn it!

58:39.308 --> 58:41.435
Don't you think this is ridiculous?

58:42.645 --> 58:44.480
You should write as you.

58:45.481 --> 58:48.484
Savy, come on.

58:48.609 --> 58:52.530
You're out of it.
Nobody listens to me as me.

58:53.447 --> 58:55.282
They listen to you as JT.

58:56.784 --> 59:00.121
But JT doesn't exist, you know?
He's not real.

59:00.246 --> 59:05.501
I mean, he's super real for some people,
you know? Like... personal.

59:07.002 --> 59:09.755
- I see it.
- Is it real for them?

59:14.009 --> 59:15.511
I got left.

59:17.471 --> 59:22.852
I got tricked...
and put in a mental home for grown-ups.

59:27.398 --> 59:28.607
Abused...

59:30.526 --> 59:34.447
Used up by men, my mom...

59:35.364 --> 59:38.117
I was that kid.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.077
And it is real.

59:41.495 --> 59:43.080
I didn't say it wasn't.

59:44.415 --> 59:46.500
That's not what I'm saying.

59:46.625 --> 59:48.210
You're so mean.

59:48.335 --> 59:52.173
You are so manipulative.
You don't have to do that with me.

59:52.298 --> 59:54.508
I'm the last person
you have to do that with.

59:54.633 --> 59:59.388
We're in Paris because of me,

01:00:01.182 --> 01:00:02.850
because of my writing,

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:05.936
because of my genius.

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:10.316
I'm glad you know how
to put an outfit together,

01:00:11.901 --> 01:00:15.237
but all you do is show up.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:18.032
I don't inhabit him,
he doesn't inhabit me,

01:00:18.157 --> 01:00:19.837
he doesn't leap out of your body
into mine?

01:00:19.867 --> 01:00:22.828
We're not making something together.
All this bullshit that you say to me

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.705
to get me to do this crazy shit?

01:00:25.706 --> 01:00:28.542
No, no, if all I do is show up,
honestly,

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:31.587
why don't I fucking go ahead
and stop showing up?

01:00:40.095 --> 01:00:42.181
Stop being a drama queen.

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:52.942
<i>I feel lost in
a limitless hall of desire and longing.</i>

01:00:53.943 --> 01:00:55.736
<i>What was I thinkin'?</i>

01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:14.380
Hey. I have to tell you something.

01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:24.598
- What?
- Yeah.

01:01:27.101 --> 01:01:29.436
- Sav...
- Yeah.

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:31.981
I've seen pictures of JT.

01:01:32.106 --> 01:01:34.400
- I bet.
- Yeah, and I read Sarah.

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:36.235
- I know.
- And never connected the dots.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.570
I noticed that.

01:01:38.821 --> 01:01:40.364
Wow. Um...

01:01:40.489 --> 01:01:42.491
OK, so wait.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.451
When you...
when you talk to people in person,

01:01:44.577 --> 01:01:46.912
they don't notice that
it's not Laura's voice?

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:51.959
And they all think that you're a boy?

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.130
It's like <i>The Emperor's New Clothes</i>
kinda deal, you know?

01:01:56.255 --> 01:01:59.258
Every time someone questions it,
Laura just throws it right back on them

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:01.719
and is like, "What do you mean,
the emperor has no clothes?

01:02:01.844 --> 01:02:03.679
That's his very best outfit."

01:02:04.597 --> 01:02:05.890
I mean...

01:02:06.807 --> 01:02:10.644
I wanted to tell you, I just think
I really valued the secret of it

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:13.772
and... wanted to protect her.

01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:18.485
I would just fucking die
if I, like, ruined that for her, and...

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:22.448
Yeah.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.993
This is literally the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:29.914
I'm really not sure if I should,
like, ask more questions or...

01:02:30.039 --> 01:02:31.874
- I don't know, run away.
- Run out of here.

01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:33.250
Yeah.

01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:35.961
Am I... terrible?

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:40.925
- I mean...
- Also it's over.

01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:42.676
I'm not gonna do it anymore,

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:45.638
which is why it was, like, a lot easier
to tell you this, to be honest.

01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:48.933
- You're not gonna do it anymore?
- No.

01:02:51.352 --> 01:02:53.812
<i>♪ If I could be</i>

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:55.856
<i>♪ What you wanted</i>

01:02:56.941 --> 01:02:58.734
<i>♪ If you wanted...</i>

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:03.238
Come and be my one?

01:03:03.364 --> 01:03:07.326
<i>♪ If I could be what you wanted...</i>

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:10.091
<i>No, it's not that
I don't want to. I've just been...</i>

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.958
I feel like if I leave the house,
I'm gonna fall into old habits.

01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:17.670
No, I know.

01:03:18.671 --> 01:03:22.925
Dennis, I know you know,
but I feel stuck...

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:25.469
No, I really wanna go, Jason.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:29.139
I do. I just...

01:03:29.515 --> 01:03:34.728
For my health,
I need to focus on me right now.

01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:38.732
I know it's probably not something
I should relive, but...

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:43.570
I mean... But they're making a movie
on my life.

01:03:45.239 --> 01:03:48.450
<i>Well, they keep asking for me
to come down to the set and...</i>

01:03:49.702 --> 01:03:50.703
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:54.873
<i>No, but how do I say no to that?</i>

01:03:56.041 --> 01:04:01.046
<i>Yeah, Eva and I have been having
phone sex lately and...</i>

01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:06.719
<i>I know it's not healthy, but...</i>

01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:10.139
<i>the heart wants
what the heart wants, right?</i>

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.700
Hey.

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:30.951
Hey.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.539
- How you doin'?
- Is that Sav?

01:04:35.664 --> 01:04:37.458
I'm OK. Yeah, it's Sav.

01:04:38.167 --> 01:04:41.628
Oh, my God.
Get her in here, it's like Christmas.

01:04:41.754 --> 01:04:44.506
Look at all this stuff
that JT gets for free.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:47.176
Thank God you're here, you guys.
Start taking stuff.

01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:49.678
Here, Astor bow ties.

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:52.514
- Look at those!
- What? No.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.726
Did you tell her about Astor
doing the music for the movie?

01:04:58.187 --> 01:05:01.774
Yeah, well, Laura's been speaking to Eva
about maybe, right,

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:05.319
you know, doing the score
for the whole movie, so...

01:05:05.444 --> 01:05:08.197
Definitely. I'm talking to her.
We're gonna push this through.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:11.325
How's she doin'?

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:14.244
She's good. She's really good.

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:17.873
I mean, she's I think overwhelmed.

01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:19.875
You know, it's a lot, making a movie.

01:05:20.751 --> 01:05:25.005
She said she wants JT to design
an outfit for her to wear in the movie.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:28.467
Oh, my God, this is beautiful.

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:29.843
You gotta try this.

01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:36.558
Look at that on. Oh, please.
Anzevino's been sending all this stuff.

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:39.144
- Like this and all this fabric.
- It's really nice.

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:41.396
He wants to support
JT the designer.

01:05:41.522 --> 01:05:43.232
Do you think I could talk to her?

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:45.692
Uh...

01:05:46.777 --> 01:05:48.987
I just got an email. You wanna see it?

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:50.989
I just got one from her.

01:05:54.785 --> 01:05:55.911
I just, I think

01:05:56.036 --> 01:05:57.788
talking to her would be hard

01:05:57.913 --> 01:06:02.334
'cause we're talking so much
and it might get a little mucky, but...

01:06:02.918 --> 01:06:04.044
Subject line.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.255
"Please, please, please
come to Tennessee.

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:11.635
Baby boy, I miss your soft lips.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:14.555
I dream of your skin."

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.557
I love this.

01:06:16.682 --> 01:06:20.185
"I wanna pull on your hair
like a horse's mane."

01:06:20.936 --> 01:06:24.106
She is so into your pheromones.
I love that.

01:06:24.231 --> 01:06:26.733
I mean you're talking to her as me,
you know? Like...

01:06:29.403 --> 01:06:30.487
Yeah.

01:06:31.572 --> 01:06:32.865
I mean...

01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:35.993
I'm talking to her as JT.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.210
We had, like, a thing.
Like, a real thing.

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.379
It wasn't bullshit, it wasn't...

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.840
I... I know that.

01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:51.925
Sav...

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:55.804
you're as much a part of JT as me.

01:06:58.056 --> 01:06:59.975
That's the truth.

01:07:00.601 --> 01:07:05.689
Not some adolescent talking to you
in Paris saying dumb shit

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:11.111
because she was jealous
and felt left out and lonely.

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:15.616
I'm so sorry. It's embarrassing.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:23.123
And the Eva thing
actually turned out to be great.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:26.418
Why shouldn't you wanna be intimate
with her? My God.

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:28.754
You guys have this connection, so...

01:07:30.422 --> 01:07:31.798
This is crazy.

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.510
And this whole Tennessee thing.

01:07:35.636 --> 01:07:40.766
I don't know what to do. I mean,
it would be... great for Astor to go

01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:42.559
because of the music, and I...

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:48.899
You know, she really wants us to be
on set and see the experience, but...

01:07:49.775 --> 01:07:53.528
I don't know if you wanna be JT again.

01:07:54.238 --> 01:07:56.865
That's... That's for you to decide.

01:08:20.639 --> 01:08:21.890
It's the wardrobe.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.191
Makeup.

01:09:16.111 --> 01:09:17.863
Well, well, well!

01:09:17.988 --> 01:09:20.115
Hi, there, baby boy!

01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:25.912
Ain't this a pretty little thing
that JT made for me?

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:31.042
- Everything looks real good.
- Oh, thank you, honeypie.

01:09:34.546 --> 01:09:36.465
Hey, there, Momma.

01:09:39.634 --> 01:09:41.094
Hey, Speedie.

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:44.055
Oi. There's your music man.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.684
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. Astor.

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:51.563
Oh, my God, I'm so glad you're here.
It's been a fucking nightmare.

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:53.607
It's just been me
and these fucking idiots.

01:09:53.732 --> 01:09:55.525
Honestly, I have to fight
for everything.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:02.366
You know what, Speedie? I kind of
understand what you're going through

01:10:02.491 --> 01:10:04.117
with this little rascal over here.

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:08.955
You know, keeping him clothed and fed
and out of mischief.

01:10:09.081 --> 01:10:11.666
I mean, it's exactly what I'm going
through on this fucking set.

01:10:11.792 --> 01:10:14.378
You have no idea. All these men.
It's like herding cats.

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:18.965
They all need attention, they all need
to express their opinions to me.

01:10:19.091 --> 01:10:21.385
Honestly, would they treat a male
director like this?

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:22.844
I don't think so.

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:26.306
You know, I'm JT's mother,
I'm the movie's mother,

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:28.725
I'm the fucking world's mother.
It's exhausting.

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:32.729
But you're doing OK though, right?

01:10:35.107 --> 01:10:37.818
Baby, I'm so happy you're here.

01:10:37.943 --> 01:10:40.862
You know, you ground me.
Calm me down.

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:45.992
I gotta finish this scene.

01:10:46.118 --> 01:10:49.663
Gotta be perfect, right?
Gotta be better than the guys.

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:52.082
- Eva, we need you on set!
- John!

01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:56.753
I told you this is not the right place.
Where are we gonna put this? What?

01:10:57.796 --> 01:10:59.464
She looks fuckin' wrecked.

01:11:01.216 --> 01:11:02.634
Fuck.

01:11:08.974 --> 01:11:11.268
I can't describe what I'm feeling.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:16.565
It's like this... déjà vu feeling.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.987
But I feel like I'm home.

01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:33.540
JT...

01:11:39.171 --> 01:11:41.673
And Eva, that was so spooky.

01:11:45.427 --> 01:11:47.053
Looking at Sarah...

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:51.641
You know, like, all these things
she's picking up on.

01:11:52.309 --> 01:11:55.395
I've never, ever told anybody about it.

01:11:56.188 --> 01:12:00.942
All about Sarah, my best friend
in the group home.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:04.446
It's like looking right at her.

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:09.576
Art is...

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.122
eerie shit, man.

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:25.967
This is so crazy.

01:12:30.889 --> 01:12:32.516
I have to tell Eva the truth.

01:12:34.643 --> 01:12:36.019
Are you sure?

01:12:38.396 --> 01:12:39.731
- Baby.
- Hey.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:42.317
Hey, I'm so glad you came.

01:12:43.902 --> 01:12:45.779
Can you believe it's all happening?

01:12:45.904 --> 01:12:47.489
- It's crazy.
- Right?

01:12:49.366 --> 01:12:51.826
Are you doing OK?
A little bit better from earlier?

01:12:51.952 --> 01:12:55.497
Yeah. I'm sorry about that.
I just, I had the worst fucking day.

01:12:55.622 --> 01:12:57.457
- But it's all gonna be fucking amazing.
- JT.

01:12:57.582 --> 01:13:00.022
It's gonna be great.
Sit down, I'm gonna get you a drink.

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.337
Nice to fucking meet you in person.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:04.965
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:05.966 --> 01:13:08.927
I am so excited
to be in your fucking movie.

01:13:10.095 --> 01:13:12.264
He knows that already, silly.

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:15.600
I've never acted in anything,
and it's so cool.

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:17.936
You're doing a really good job.

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:21.690
So, is it, like, weird for you?

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:24.317
What?

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:27.737
Like seeing your whole life
recreated and shit?

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:33.201
Uh... Yeah, it's weird.

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:40.667
I've been working on that song
we were talkin' about.

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:43.336
Hmm, play it.

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:51.386
<i>♪ I told you to tell me</i>

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:54.055
<i>♪ To sign on the dotted line</i>

01:13:54.514 --> 01:13:58.727
<i>♪ Any time I gotta sell my soul</i>

01:13:59.519 --> 01:14:00.895
<i>♪ For the...</i>

01:14:03.398 --> 01:14:05.859
Did we settle on first or second?
I can't remember.

01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:13.742
- First.
- Yeah.

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:17.203
You gotta get that recorded, baby,
so it's ready for the soundtrack.

01:14:17.329 --> 01:14:18.872
I... I'm gonna.

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:25.587
It's really cool that Astor's got
some stuff for the soundtrack too.

01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:29.841
Oh, my God, JT.
I really can't talk about this again.

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:39.351
I'm sorry, babe.

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:43.855
I am thinkin' about it.

01:14:44.481 --> 01:14:45.815
OK.

01:14:47.025 --> 01:14:50.570
Remember, babe, that scene tomorrow
that I was talking about earlier?

01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:52.781
When you see Jeremiah
in the basement?

01:14:53.782 --> 01:14:56.785
I was gonna shoot it with the dolly
when I told you about it earlier,

01:14:56.910 --> 01:15:00.163
but I feel like... I feel like I need
to shoot it handheld, behind you.

01:15:00.288 --> 01:15:01.414
You mind if I take a shower?

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.619
- I've been running around all day.
- Yeah, go, babe.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:05.308
- I feel really dirty.
- It's over there.

01:15:05.335 --> 01:15:06.544
I think it'd be much cooler...

01:15:41.705 --> 01:15:43.123
Hey.

01:15:44.332 --> 01:15:46.626
- You're not helping.
- I'm helping you!

01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:51.256
Stop! Stop it! I'm tired, let's go.
Oh, my God.

01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:53.466
All right.

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:56.594
Hey.
It's so late, babe. Just crash here.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.807
This is actually super comfy.
Manson stayed on it last week.

01:16:00.932 --> 01:16:02.058
We're gonna go to bed.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:04.269
- I'm so fucking tired.
- Night, JT.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.396
- Goodnight.
- Night.

01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:07.522
Hey.

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:58.406
<i>She's not really quitting, right?</i>

01:16:58.531 --> 01:16:59.908
I mean,

01:17:00.992 --> 01:17:03.203
she'll come around, huh?

01:17:04.162 --> 01:17:07.123
- We're a team.
- No, baby. No.

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:13.004
Look, I'm sorry, I gotta set a boundary
here, OK? Either you stop or I'm out.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:14.422
Hey.

01:17:15.381 --> 01:17:17.509
You know what that means for me.

01:17:29.437 --> 01:17:31.022
OK, it's done.

01:17:33.358 --> 01:17:34.484
OK.

01:17:35.235 --> 01:17:36.569
OK.

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:52.520
- Hm-hmm?
- Hm-hmm.

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:54.188
All right, I gotta jet.

01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:56.608
I'll be back soon, OK?

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:05.325
<i>Don't worry,
I'll get back to writin'.</i>

01:19:06.326 --> 01:19:08.620
No. Trust me, you.

01:19:08.745 --> 01:19:10.997
I can't really answer that, Dot.

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:16.794
They say I don't exist, so I'm not even
talkin' to you right now, right?

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:19.088
<i>When shit gets this bleak,</i>

01:19:20.298 --> 01:19:23.885
you have no idea where I could go,
what I could do to myself.

01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:27.597
You have no idea.

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:33.853
JT?

01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:35.980
I...

01:19:37.357 --> 01:19:41.611
I think you've got the wrong person.
But I'll send your server over.

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:44.113
OK.

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:47.700
<i>Jason, no. I don't...</i>

01:19:49.744 --> 01:19:50.912
What?

01:19:51.788 --> 01:19:54.749
Really? That's crazy.

01:19:56.501 --> 01:19:59.963
No, I ain't workin' at no restaurant.

01:20:00.088 --> 01:20:02.048
Life's the same old thing.

01:20:02.173 --> 01:20:06.052
People just tryin' to cut me down,
say I don't exist,

01:20:06.177 --> 01:20:10.974
and I'm out there,
say I'm workin' in a restaurant

01:20:11.099 --> 01:20:12.892
when I'm here talkin' to you.

01:20:17.772 --> 01:20:21.901
Eva, why would you for one second
listen to some dumb rumor?

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:24.487
Rumors have been circling me for years.

01:20:24.612 --> 01:20:29.158
I mean, come on, you know
my spirit, my soul, my art.

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:32.704
We're creative partners.
You gotta trust me on this.

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:34.038
How can I prove...?

01:20:34.956 --> 01:20:36.958
The premiere?

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:41.587
Of course I wanna come,
but you know how hard travel is on me.

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:44.465
Yeah, OK.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:48.177
I get it. I get... I'll go.

01:20:49.012 --> 01:20:50.763
I'll be there.

01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:11.325
Everything OK?

01:21:11.451 --> 01:21:12.577
Yeah.

01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:20.209
Was that Laura?

01:21:24.756 --> 01:21:25.965
I can tell.

01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:33.514
Eva's movie or JT's movie or whatever
got into the Cannes Film Festival.

01:21:36.851 --> 01:21:38.936
And they want JT to go.

01:21:40.855 --> 01:21:45.234
They're pretty desperate for him
to be there, like, to promote the movie.

01:21:46.861 --> 01:21:49.489
And they'd pay me, like,
a thousand dollars a day.

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:53.242
People are skeptical too, you know?
Especially Eva.

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:56.537
If JT doesn't go, the whole thing
will be over for Laura, you know?

01:21:57.455 --> 01:22:00.041
I know, but so what?

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:05.088
Every time you come back from being JT,
you're a mess.

01:22:05.213 --> 01:22:07.673
I could use the money.
It's a lot of money.

01:22:07.799 --> 01:22:09.884
And use a few more people
while you're at it?

01:22:11.803 --> 01:22:17.225
That's a... really reductive,
simplified version of it.

01:22:18.017 --> 01:22:19.811
We've talked about that.

01:22:21.104 --> 01:22:24.607
OK. Let's get real for a second.

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:31.322
People respond to JT
because of who they think he is.

01:22:32.365 --> 01:22:34.117
But what you guys are doing
is just, like...

01:22:34.242 --> 01:22:38.121
People get just as much
as they... put into it.

01:22:38.246 --> 01:22:41.958
It's like they use us, we use them.
Everyone uses each other.

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:44.293
- That's like how it is.
- Oh, my God.

01:22:46.045 --> 01:22:47.964
You've already decided, haven't you?

01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:50.550
It's one more time.

01:22:51.342 --> 01:22:55.930
I mean, do you hear yourself right now?
Just one more time again? Like...

01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:57.682
You sound like an addict.

01:22:57.807 --> 01:23:02.145
Honestly, I'm... missing something.

01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:04.397
Like I... I miss it.

01:23:05.106 --> 01:23:07.233
Please. We both know this is about Eva.

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:12.113
You miss her.

01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:16.117
Do you wanna see her?

01:23:16.868 --> 01:23:18.661
But that's not happenin', Sav.

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:21.164
I mean, it's crazy.

01:23:21.289 --> 01:23:24.250
She's into who she thinks JT is,
not you.

01:23:28.713 --> 01:23:30.590
I fucked her in Paris.

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:36.053
- What?
- I should've told you. I...

01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:37.889
I'm sorry.

01:23:44.896 --> 01:23:46.939
I always knew you had a crush.

01:23:48.482 --> 01:23:50.401
I mean, it was fuckin' obvious.

01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:55.740
But of course I...
I didn't think it really meant anything.

01:23:56.866 --> 01:23:58.743
I mean, you know me.

01:23:58.868 --> 01:24:02.079
Had you told me earlier, I wouldn't
have freaked out, but to lie about it?

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:08.628
Just think about what you want and what
you're doing, and then we can talk.

01:27:19.318 --> 01:27:22.113
- Oi!
- Hey, Eva. Hey.

01:27:22.238 --> 01:27:24.865
They want the two of you
to introduce the film.

01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:26.867
- No. No.
- Eva! Eva!

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:29.412
- No.
- What?

01:27:30.121 --> 01:27:31.789
- Babyhead!
- Oh, my God.

01:27:31.914 --> 01:27:35.042
What's...? Come here. What's wrong?

01:27:37.086 --> 01:27:38.796
<i>I don't know what I was thinking.</i>

01:27:39.672 --> 01:27:42.174
I really thought something
could have worked out between us.

01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:44.135
I feel like a complete idiot.

01:27:45.928 --> 01:27:49.181
Don't blame yourself. OK?

01:27:49.306 --> 01:27:52.643
Oh, my God. What? For going there?

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:55.646
If we never let ourselves go there,
we'll never grow.

01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:59.066
So you're stuck, right?

01:27:59.191 --> 01:28:03.362
Some emotional vortex with her.
There's no way around that,

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:06.824
so you need to talk to her
about what happened in Tennessee.

01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:11.078
You're at an impasse,
my beautiful friend.

01:28:12.705 --> 01:28:15.499
- OK?
- Hmm.

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:18.627
It's like one of those sores
that scabs over

01:28:18.752 --> 01:28:21.130
and all kinds of dirt are underneath.

01:28:21.672 --> 01:28:24.425
You just gotta go back in
and take that dirt out.

01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:25.593
Yeah.

01:28:25.718 --> 01:28:28.596
Talk to her
and clean up this mess, right?

01:28:28.721 --> 01:28:30.806
Yeah.

01:28:30.931 --> 01:28:34.143
Hey. I love you.

01:28:36.103 --> 01:28:37.855
Come on.

01:28:42.443 --> 01:28:46.113
<i>You took a film about truck-stop
hookers to the Cannes Film Festival.</i>

01:28:46.572 --> 01:28:48.866
People know you're only involved
if it's edgy,

01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:50.826
if it's relevant, if it's real.

01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:54.997
More importantly, JT is interested
in taking the problems

01:28:55.122 --> 01:28:59.793
of the soul, the spirit,
and transforming them into craft.

01:28:59.919 --> 01:29:03.464
Oh, my God!
He does it with his own designs.

01:29:03.589 --> 01:29:04.715
You design?

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:20.564
I just wanted to say something...

01:29:28.197 --> 01:29:32.910
Just that in... Tennessee,
I was feeling,

01:29:34.078 --> 01:29:36.872
like, really hurt 'cause,

01:29:36.997 --> 01:29:41.043
you know, that you were with... Ben.

01:29:41.418 --> 01:29:44.588
Not that you shouldn't have been.
It's just...

01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:48.425
I shouldn't have been there and...

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.137
it was awkward and shitty.

01:29:53.347 --> 01:29:54.598
Really?

01:29:55.182 --> 01:29:57.726
That's what you wanna talk about, JT?

01:30:01.105 --> 01:30:02.982
What did you expect?

01:30:03.107 --> 01:30:06.485
Like one drunk fuck and I was gonna
run off into the sunset with you,

01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:10.114
and be in some
sweet little lesbian relationship?

01:30:12.199 --> 01:30:14.118
I mean you wrote all those...

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:18.372
emails.

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:24.962
I guess you just wanted the film rights.

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:31.093
I've put my whole life
in this movie.

01:30:33.971 --> 01:30:37.933
I made a movie
that is based on a true story, right?

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:39.852
I made this film for you.

01:30:41.729 --> 01:30:43.689
I mean, you kinda made it
for yourself too though.

01:30:43.814 --> 01:30:46.525
You know what? Don't tell me
who I made this movie for, all right?

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:49.695
And don't pretend like you don't know
what I'm trying to talk about.

01:30:51.155 --> 01:30:54.450
Do you know how many times
I had to defend you?

01:30:54.575 --> 01:30:58.412
Like, tell people,
"No, JT is actually real"?

01:31:00.456 --> 01:31:03.626
If this whole thing
turns out to be bullshit...

01:31:10.007 --> 01:31:13.552
I'm gonna be devastated, JT, OK?

01:31:15.512 --> 01:31:17.222
You gotta tell me.

01:31:18.098 --> 01:31:21.518
Please tell me that your story is real.

01:31:22.603 --> 01:31:24.521
Tell me that you wrote these books

01:31:26.607 --> 01:31:28.859
and that you are who you say you are.

01:31:40.245 --> 01:31:41.747
Eva...

01:31:49.672 --> 01:31:52.091
I mean, JT's whoever you want him to be.

01:31:58.764 --> 01:32:00.474
Oh, my God.

01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:37.219
<i>I feel like... we're salmon</i>

01:32:37.344 --> 01:32:39.513
<i>returning to our ocean home.</i>

01:32:39.638 --> 01:32:42.224
<i>And we're finally leavin' the chrysalis</i>

01:32:42.349 --> 01:32:46.520
<i>to become the monarch butterflies
of our own selves.</i>

01:32:47.271 --> 01:32:50.065
<i>I feel like I've arrived.</i>

01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:54.278
<i>Like I've finally found my true self.</i>

01:33:00.033 --> 01:33:02.703
<i>Laura, this is John Bradwell
from "The Guardian".</i>

01:33:02.828 --> 01:33:04.621
<i>I'm running a piece about JT,</i>

01:33:04.747 --> 01:33:07.833
<i>in particular, about the photo
I found online of Savannah.</i>

01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:10.335
<i>It looks strikingly like Mr. LeRoy.</i>

01:33:11.378 --> 01:33:14.173
<i>It'd really be in your best interests
to return my call.</i>

01:33:15.549 --> 01:33:16.550
Fuck.

01:33:16.675 --> 01:33:18.218
<i>Geoff. Bradwell with "The Guardian"</i>

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:20.095
<i>calling again to confirm
that Savannah...</i>

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.681
Yeah, Savannah, my sister,

01:33:22.806 --> 01:33:26.769
was the body of... of JT Leroy, yeah.

01:33:26.894 --> 01:33:30.606
But, Laura... Laura was the voice.
She... She did all the writing.

01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:34.026
<i>Savannah, Bradwell calling again.</i>

01:33:34.151 --> 01:33:36.445
<i>Listen, I know for a fact
that you're JT,</i>

01:33:36.570 --> 01:33:41.116
<i>so at this point you should really just
make a statement before my story runs.</i>

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:48.290
This may sound crazy, but the
whole thing was never a big scheme.

01:33:48.415 --> 01:33:51.043
Never at all. I mean, it was just...

01:33:51.168 --> 01:33:53.879
I dunno, it just got out of hand.
It snowballed, I guess.

01:34:02.888 --> 01:34:05.474
What the fuck?

01:34:06.058 --> 01:34:09.394
I guess we betrayed some people, sure.

01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:18.946
Baby, did you get followed?

01:34:19.071 --> 01:34:20.781
I don't know, I don't think so.

01:34:22.032 --> 01:34:24.993
Fuck. This is a fucking witch-hunt.

01:34:26.286 --> 01:34:29.706
Do you... Do you want a tea?
Or I can make you eggs or something.

01:34:29.832 --> 01:34:31.625
No, I can't eat anything. I'm OK.

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:34.920
Oh, my God.

01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:36.672
Babe.

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:44.638
They know who I am now.

01:34:50.853 --> 01:34:52.646
I'm so ashamed.

01:34:57.651 --> 01:35:00.112
I just wanna fucking disappear.

01:35:04.741 --> 01:35:06.410
How are you holding up?

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:11.540
I mean, I figured
I'd feel some kind of relief.

01:35:14.501 --> 01:35:17.379
But I'm kind of at a loss.
I'm just like...

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:22.384
- At a loss.
- Yeah.

01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:26.263
Babyhead.

01:35:28.473 --> 01:35:31.476
It's the fucking end
of the book.

01:35:31.602 --> 01:35:33.562
It's like the end of Sarah.

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:38.442
JT's, like, running naked
through the woods.

01:35:38.942 --> 01:35:40.402
They have pitchforks.

01:35:41.945 --> 01:35:43.780
They're fucking after him.

01:35:45.282 --> 01:35:47.326
Mad 'cause he's actually a boy.

01:35:51.455 --> 01:35:53.957
You could have written
a different ending.

01:35:56.335 --> 01:35:58.045
It had to be that ending.

01:36:05.594 --> 01:36:07.512
It's a great fucking ending.

01:36:19.566 --> 01:36:22.194
<i>They think
that the work is fraudulent.</i>

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:28.450
You know, this ain't a hoax,
this ain't fraud.

01:36:28.575 --> 01:36:30.243
My books are real.

01:36:34.164 --> 01:36:35.290
Hello?

01:36:38.335 --> 01:36:39.503
Hello?

01:37:18.667 --> 01:37:23.046
Without further ado, let's give
a warm welcome to Laura Albert.

01:37:43.066 --> 01:37:44.735
Tom Waits...

01:37:46.069 --> 01:37:51.199
wanted to do an interview
with JT LeRoy for <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

01:37:52.826 --> 01:37:54.661
JT declined...

01:37:57.205 --> 01:37:59.499
because he was notoriously shy.

01:38:05.005 --> 01:38:09.176
One of the reasons JT was so shy

01:38:11.261 --> 01:38:13.847
is JT didn't have a body.

01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:18.351
JT was an avatar.

01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:22.606
We are given this persona,

01:38:23.607 --> 01:38:26.151
and then we are given this body.

01:38:26.693 --> 01:38:30.572
And there's no promise
from whomever made us

01:38:30.697 --> 01:38:32.657
that the two will be in sync.

01:38:34.284 --> 01:38:38.205
And, hey, I say we can be in the misery

01:38:39.915 --> 01:38:42.042
of trying to get them to match up,

01:38:44.252 --> 01:38:46.505
or we can create our own world.

01:38:49.466 --> 01:38:50.967
Let me take you back.

01:38:52.094 --> 01:38:54.012
I was in a group home,

01:38:54.429 --> 01:38:56.681
I'm in my pain,

01:38:56.807 --> 01:38:59.226
and there's pain all around,

01:38:59.351 --> 01:39:00.727
and I'm...

01:39:01.269 --> 01:39:03.688
I'm looking for the tools...

01:39:05.357 --> 01:39:07.734
for other people to feel that pain,

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:10.612
to understand it,

01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:15.909
and I can't be in this body, you know?

01:39:16.034 --> 01:39:20.956
Because my biggest fear
is if I tell you my pain,

01:39:22.541 --> 01:39:25.001
you'll say, "You deserved it.

01:39:25.127 --> 01:39:27.254
You're disgusting.

01:39:27.379 --> 01:39:28.797
You're horrible."

01:39:30.799 --> 01:39:35.512
And I'm seeing
these blond, blue-eyed boys

01:39:35.637 --> 01:39:38.140
on after-school specials,
and I'm like...

01:39:40.225 --> 01:39:42.060
I gotta find another body.

01:39:45.605 --> 01:39:48.108
So I start calling suicide hotlines.

01:39:50.068 --> 01:39:51.862
And I meet JT.

01:39:53.864 --> 01:39:56.700
I was as surprised as everyone else

01:39:58.869 --> 01:40:01.037
what JT wrote.

01:40:03.498 --> 01:40:05.250
Then I was sad

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:12.424
'cause I couldn't give
JT the body he wanted.

01:40:16.011 --> 01:40:17.971
The body he deserved.

01:40:22.809 --> 01:40:26.396
And he found that in Savannah.

01:40:32.444 --> 01:40:35.197
- Um, but to be back is...
- Oh, I know.

01:40:35.322 --> 01:40:37.324
- ...meta.
- It's incredible.

01:40:37.449 --> 01:40:38.617
- What's your name?
- Mikayla.

01:40:38.742 --> 01:40:41.077
Mikayla. Pleasure.

01:40:41.203 --> 01:40:42.871
- Thank you.
- Really.

01:40:42.996 --> 01:40:44.039
Hey.

01:40:45.624 --> 01:40:47.626
Babyhead. Get in here.

01:40:48.001 --> 01:40:49.461
It's been a long time.

01:40:50.962 --> 01:40:52.756
I'm... I'm really glad that I came.

01:40:52.881 --> 01:40:54.507
I'm really glad you did too.

01:40:54.633 --> 01:40:55.842
- What's your name?
- DJ.

01:40:55.967 --> 01:40:58.678
- DJ. Thanks for coming.
- Thank you so much.

01:40:59.596 --> 01:41:01.097
How's Geoff?

01:41:01.223 --> 01:41:05.060
He's good. You know, he's being Geoff.
Making music.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.062
I like what you said earlier too.

01:41:07.187 --> 01:41:09.856
Thank you for connecting
to Sarah like that.

01:41:09.981 --> 01:41:11.233
It's really beautiful.

01:41:11.358 --> 01:41:13.443
Oh, can we just get
a picture of you guys?

01:41:13.568 --> 01:41:15.946
- Sure.
- Yeah, sure.

01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:18.657
Wow.

01:41:18.782 --> 01:41:19.783
Here we are.

01:41:22.661 --> 01:41:27.582
Well, I also came to say goodbye.
Um, I'm gonna move to New York.

01:41:28.166 --> 01:41:29.292
I'm excited.

01:41:29.417 --> 01:41:32.545
Wow. I guess. That's a big one for you.

01:41:33.004 --> 01:41:34.673
- What's your name?
- Thomas.

01:41:41.346 --> 01:41:45.892
Congratulations. And, you know,
maybe I'll see you out in the world.

01:41:46.017 --> 01:41:48.395
Out playing in the fields of the Lord.

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.021
- What's your name?
- Alex.

01:41:55.527 --> 01:41:56.778
Hey, Sav.

01:41:58.071 --> 01:42:01.491
I heard you were, uh... writing.

01:42:02.242 --> 01:42:05.203
- Yeah.
- Just remember.

01:42:05.328 --> 01:42:08.128
Just 'cause you played
a writer, doesn't mean you are one.

01:42:14.838 --> 01:42:16.089
Good luck.

01:42:18.758 --> 01:42:19.926
Thank you.

01:42:21.553 --> 01:42:23.054
- What's your name?
- Eva.

01:42:23.179 --> 01:42:24.973
Eva...

01:42:37.235 --> 01:42:39.237
