WEBVTT

01:38.246 --> 01:39.855
We're screwed.

01:39.956 --> 01:41.590
No more free Wi-Fi.

01:43.026 --> 01:44.026
Hey, Ki-jung!

01:44.127 --> 01:45.194
Yeah?

01:45.295 --> 01:49.365
The lady upstairs
put a password on "iptime".

01:49.466 --> 01:51.200
A password?

01:51.301 --> 01:52.934
Did you try 123456789?

01:53.078 --> 01:54.078
No luck.

01:54.179 --> 01:55.579
Do it the other way.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.081
I tried that too!

01:57.182 --> 02:01.418
Fuck, then we can't get WhatsApp?

02:01.519 --> 02:02.694
Nothing.

02:03.271 --> 02:05.489
Hey, Jim Ki-taek.

02:06.024 --> 02:09.493
Don't fucking pretend to sleep.
What do you think?

02:10.028 --> 02:16.083
Our phones are shut off.
Now our Wi-Fi is shut off.

02:16.618 --> 02:19.711
What's your plan?

02:21.998 --> 02:23.232
- Ki-woo.
- Yes, Dad?

02:23.333 --> 02:27.260
For Wi-Fi, held it high.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.474
Stick it in every corner and so on.

02:36.012 --> 02:40.065
Damn stink bugs.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.793
Over here! I got it!

02:42.894 --> 02:44.211
Really? You got a signal?

02:44.312 --> 02:46.130
Yeah, see?

02:46.231 --> 02:48.882
This one, "coffeeland 2G".

02:48.983 --> 02:50.968
Did a new cafe open?

02:51.069 --> 02:52.678
Why can't I get it?

02:52.779 --> 02:54.388
Climb up here.

02:54.489 --> 02:55.789
Hey kids.

02:56.189 --> 02:58.183
- Does it work?
- Yeah.

02:58.284 --> 03:00.836
Then check WhatsApp.

03:01.371 --> 03:03.713
Pizza Generation said they'd contact me.

03:04.249 --> 03:05.632
Hold on.

03:06.167 --> 03:08.510
Here it is.
Pizza Generation.

03:11.548 --> 03:15.284
Wow!
Check this out, guys.

03:15.385 --> 03:18.579
If we go as fast as her,
we can finish today.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.913
Then we can get paid.

03:20.014 --> 03:23.483
- Should we stand up too?
- She's a pro.

03:23.643 --> 03:26.611
What? Fumigation?

03:28.273 --> 03:29.757
They still do that kind of thing?

03:29.858 --> 03:30.799
Guess so.

03:30.900 --> 03:31.675
Shut the window.

03:31.776 --> 03:34.261
Leave it open.
We'll get free extermination.

03:34.362 --> 03:36.054
Kill the stink bugs.

03:36.155 --> 03:39.040
Right, too many
stink bugs these days...

03:41.119 --> 03:43.461
God, that smells!

03:45.999 --> 03:47.733
I told you to shut it!

03:47.834 --> 03:49.926
Should I shut it, Dad?

04:00.763 --> 04:02.564
What exactly is the problem?

04:03.600 --> 04:06.418
Take this one as an example.

04:06.519 --> 04:08.862
You call this a straight line?

04:09.397 --> 04:11.256
And why's it folded here?

04:11.357 --> 04:13.008
Why is this sticking up?

04:13.109 --> 04:15.702
You didn't even fold it.

04:16.738 --> 04:20.516
A quarter of them look like this.

04:20.617 --> 04:23.168
So 1 out of 4 are rejects.

04:26.331 --> 04:30.217
So you're really docking
10% off our pay?

04:30.543 --> 04:34.221
Considering the rejects
that's a low penalty, isn't it?

04:35.089 --> 04:38.350
Our pay is so low already!
How can you do this?

04:40.386 --> 04:41.386
Look here.

04:41.487 --> 04:44.289
This is not some minor issue.

04:44.390 --> 04:49.444
You know what one shitty boss
can do to our brand image?

04:49.854 --> 04:53.198
Brand? You can't even
afford a box folder!

04:53.441 --> 04:54.574
What did you say?

04:55.610 --> 04:56.710
Boss.

04:57.695 --> 04:58.929
This is all because
of that guy, right?

04:59.030 --> 04:59.888
What guy?

04:59.989 --> 05:03.851
Your part-time worker.
He's gone AWOL, right?

05:03.952 --> 05:07.062
Just when the Love of God Church
made a huge group order?

05:07.163 --> 05:10.298
How do you know all that?

05:10.458 --> 05:12.025
Who told you?

05:12.126 --> 05:14.111
My sister knows the guy.

05:14.212 --> 05:18.740
He's always been a bit strange.
Got a bad reputation.

05:18.841 --> 05:20.934
Speaking of which, Boss.

05:21.469 --> 05:23.495
We'll accept a 10% penalty.

05:23.596 --> 05:24.580
In return.

05:24.681 --> 05:26.022
In return?

05:26.182 --> 05:28.667
Any thought of hiring
a new part-time worker?

05:28.768 --> 05:32.153
Sis, we need someone!

05:32.689 --> 05:36.116
Ditch the guy you've got now.
Just fire him.

05:36.901 --> 05:40.036
Tomorrow I'll come for
a formal interview. What time?

05:40.321 --> 05:41.663
Wait, hold on a sec.

05:42.282 --> 05:44.541
Let me think about it.

05:45.076 --> 05:48.378
Then for now,
just pay for the boxes.

05:54.877 --> 05:58.346
So weæŠ®e all gathered here today.

05:58.631 --> 06:01.992
To celebrate the
reconnection of our phones,

06:02.093 --> 06:05.913
and this bounteous Wi-Fi!

06:06.014 --> 06:09.566
Look at that bastard.
It's not even dark yet.

06:10.101 --> 06:13.795
Why didn't you put up a
'No Urinating' sign?

06:13.896 --> 06:14.546
I told you!

06:14.647 --> 06:19.034
No, signs like that just make
them piss even more.

06:19.569 --> 06:21.345
At least shout at him!

06:21.446 --> 06:23.079
Don't shout.

06:23.197 --> 06:25.332
"Please don't piss!"

06:26.868 --> 06:29.961
Hey, is that Min?

06:30.496 --> 06:32.564
Hey mister, that's not a toilet.

06:32.665 --> 06:33.982
Way to go, Min.

06:34.083 --> 06:36.151
Hey, punk!

06:36.252 --> 06:39.471
Who are you staring at, asshole?

06:39.630 --> 06:43.141
Come here!
You little shit.

06:44.761 --> 06:47.228
Get a fucking grip!

06:48.264 --> 06:50.290
That's an impressive friend.

06:50.391 --> 06:53.460
College students have
a real vigor to them.

06:53.561 --> 06:54.503
Not like my brother.

06:54.604 --> 06:58.006
But is he coming here?
Did you invite him?

06:58.107 --> 06:59.207
No.

06:59.317 --> 07:00.342
Hello!

07:00.443 --> 07:02.077
Oh hi, Min!

07:02.220 --> 07:03.220
Min!

07:03.321 --> 07:04.096
Are you well, sir?

07:04.197 --> 07:06.890
- Sure.
- What are you doing here?

07:06.991 --> 07:08.583
I texted you.
Didn't you see it?

07:09.118 --> 07:10.185
Sorry, were you eating?

07:10.286 --> 07:11.478
No, we weren't eating.

07:11.579 --> 07:13.855
- How are you, Ki-jung?
- Fine, you too?

07:13.956 --> 07:16.692
We could've met outside,
why come here?

07:16.793 --> 07:17.526
Because of this.

07:17.627 --> 07:20.487
It's for you, but it's so heavy.

07:20.588 --> 07:22.889
Really?
Put it down here.

07:24.926 --> 07:26.535
Wow, what is that?

07:26.636 --> 07:28.203
When I said I was meeting Ki-woo,

07:28.304 --> 07:31.564
my grandfather insisted
I bring this to you.

07:36.104 --> 07:38.279
Is this a landscape type?

07:39.398 --> 07:41.258
Or you can see it as
an abstract type.

07:41.359 --> 07:43.051
Wow, you know these!

07:43.152 --> 07:47.180
My grandpa has collected
scholar's rocks since his cadet days.

07:47.281 --> 07:50.809
Now the annex, the study,
every room in the house

07:50.910 --> 07:52.894
is filled with these things.

07:52.995 --> 07:56.857
But this stone here is said to
bring material wealth to families...

07:56.958 --> 07:58.299
Min!

07:58.459 --> 08:01.570
This is so metaphorical.

08:01.671 --> 08:04.990
For sure.
It's a very opportune gift.

08:05.091 --> 08:05.782
Of course.

08:05.883 --> 08:09.936
Please relay our deepest thanks
to your grandpa.

08:10.471 --> 08:12.230
Food would be better.

08:22.024 --> 08:25.177
What was that called?
A landscape stone?

08:25.278 --> 08:26.595
You collect those rocks too?

08:26.696 --> 08:31.458
Hey, thanks to that rock I saw
your parents, they look healthy.

08:32.994 --> 08:36.963
They're plenty healthy,
just out of work.

08:39.083 --> 08:42.051
Is Ki-jung taking lessons
these days?

08:42.587 --> 08:45.638
She can't afford lessons.

08:54.265 --> 08:55.857
Cute, huh?

08:56.767 --> 08:59.044
She's the one you're tutoring?

08:59.145 --> 09:01.588
Park Da-hye.
High school sophomore.

09:01.689 --> 09:05.074
You take over as her English tutor.

09:05.343 --> 09:06.343
What do you mean?

09:06.444 --> 09:08.953
Tutor a rich kid.
It pays well.

09:09.989 --> 09:11.098
She's a nice girl.

09:11.199 --> 09:14.584
Look after her while
I'm studying abroad.

09:15.119 --> 09:18.480
What about your
university friends?

09:18.581 --> 09:22.175
Why ask a loser like me?

09:22.710 --> 09:24.052
Why do you think?

09:24.587 --> 09:26.696
Just the thought makes me sick.

09:26.797 --> 09:30.951
Those disgusting frat boys
slavering over Da-hye?

09:31.052 --> 09:33.394
It's revolting.

09:38.935 --> 09:40.401
You like her?

09:45.441 --> 09:47.617
Hey, I'm serious.

09:48.653 --> 09:53.039
When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.933
So you take care of her
until then.

09:55.034 --> 09:59.546
If it's you,
I can leave in peace.

10:01.082 --> 10:03.758
Thanks for your trust,

10:03.876 --> 10:07.720
but do I have to pretend
to be a college student?

10:09.257 --> 10:12.225
Ki-woo, think about it.

10:12.760 --> 10:16.163
For years including
your military service,

10:16.264 --> 10:18.582
you took the university
entrance exam 4 times.

10:18.683 --> 10:21.734
Grammar, vocabulary,
composition, conversation...

10:22.270 --> 10:23.753
When it comes to English,

10:23.854 --> 10:28.199
you can teach 10 times better than
those drunken college pricks.

10:29.735 --> 10:32.328
- I guess so.
- Sure!

10:32.488 --> 10:36.183
But will they hire me?
I'm not a college student.

10:36.284 --> 10:37.809
Just fake it.

10:37.910 --> 10:42.046
Don't worry, you'll have
my recommendation, plus...

10:42.582 --> 10:45.758
How should I describe the mother...?

10:47.795 --> 10:49.196
She's a bit simple.

10:49.297 --> 10:50.447
<i>Young and simple.</i>

10:50.548 --> 10:51.681
Simple?

10:52.216 --> 10:53.617
What do you mean?

10:53.718 --> 10:57.979
Anyway, it's all good.
I had fun there.

10:58.498 --> 10:59.498
So you agree?

10:59.599 --> 11:01.399
I guess so.

11:02.435 --> 11:06.338
Hey, you said your sister
is artistic?

11:06.439 --> 11:10.634
Good at Photoshop?

11:10.735 --> 11:14.846
God, with skills like this,
why can't you get into art school?

11:14.947 --> 11:16.581
Shut up.

11:18.743 --> 11:20.894
Hey, no smoking in here.

11:20.995 --> 11:22.395
Yeah, yeah.
Gimme that.

11:22.496 --> 11:23.671
Yeah.

11:28.002 --> 11:30.970
Now the cherry on top...

11:32.506 --> 11:36.910
Wow, does Oxford have a major
in document forgery?

11:37.011 --> 11:40.372
Ki-jung would be top of her class.

11:40.473 --> 11:43.166
She's amazing, huh?

11:43.267 --> 11:48.780
Our boy's going for a job interview.
Wish him luck.

11:49.315 --> 11:50.415
Son.

11:51.359 --> 11:54.327
I'm proud of you.

11:54.445 --> 11:55.545
Dad.

11:56.447 --> 11:59.683
I don't think of this
as forgery or crime.

11:59.784 --> 12:01.768
I'll go this university
next year.

12:01.869 --> 12:05.355
So you've got a plan!

12:05.456 --> 12:09.634
I just printed out
the document a bit early.

12:44.787 --> 12:46.087
<i>Who is it?</i>

12:46.622 --> 12:48.440
Madame?
Good afternoon.

12:48.541 --> 12:50.317
I'm here on
Min's recommendation...

12:50.418 --> 12:52.552
<i>Oh right, come in.</i>

12:53.587 --> 12:54.687
Thank you.

13:26.620 --> 13:27.879
Hello!

13:28.622 --> 13:30.023
Hello, Madame.

13:30.124 --> 13:33.551
I just work here.
Come this way.

13:34.086 --> 13:35.695
The yard is so nice.

13:35.796 --> 13:37.430
The insider's nice too.

13:37.965 --> 13:41.250
You know the architect Namgoong?
He's famous.

13:41.351 --> 13:44.062
He used to live in this house.

13:46.223 --> 13:48.441
He designed it himself.

13:51.479 --> 13:56.449
As you can see,
now it's a playpen.

13:56.984 --> 13:58.084
This way.

14:00.488 --> 14:02.855
Sit yourself down here.
I'll bring the madame.

14:02.956 --> 14:04.056
Yes.

14:16.253 --> 14:17.512
Madame.

14:18.547 --> 14:19.764
Madame?

14:25.262 --> 14:26.771
Madame?

14:30.309 --> 14:32.735
He's here.
The tutoring candidate.

14:36.273 --> 14:38.491
I don't care about documents.

14:39.026 --> 14:41.577
Min recommended you, after all.

14:42.279 --> 14:48.334
As you know, Min is such
a brilliant human being.

14:48.869 --> 14:51.104
Da-hye and I were
quite happy with him.

14:51.205 --> 14:54.441
Regardless of her grades.
Know what I mean?

14:54.542 --> 14:55.642
Yes.

14:56.168 --> 14:57.819
He was marvelous.

14:57.920 --> 15:04.842
So to be honest, we wanted to stick
with him through high school.

15:05.678 --> 15:09.021
But all of a sudden
he's going abroad.

15:11.183 --> 15:16.671
Anyway, excuse me,
but if I can speak directly,

15:16.772 --> 15:21.593
if you're not up to
Min's level, then,

15:21.694 --> 15:24.120
I'm not sure what the point is.

15:26.156 --> 15:29.893
So anyway,
what I want to say is,

15:29.994 --> 15:35.648
for your first lesson today,
do you mind if I sit in.

15:35.749 --> 15:39.719
I want to see it full time,
how you run your lesson.

15:41.755 --> 15:43.848
Is it okay with you?

16:11.994 --> 16:13.794
You sure about #24?

16:21.837 --> 16:26.449
Da-hye, you solved those later
problems then went back to #24.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.225
Right?

16:29.762 --> 16:31.103
Yes.

16:38.729 --> 16:44.200
If that were the first question
on a real exam, you'd be screwed.

16:44.735 --> 16:48.371
Look at this.
Your pulse is racing.

16:50.908 --> 16:54.335
The heart doesn't lie.

16:55.579 --> 16:58.439
An exam is like
slashing through a jungle.

16:58.540 --> 17:01.384
Lose that momentum
and you're finished.

17:01.543 --> 17:03.903
The answer to #24?
I don't care.

17:04.004 --> 17:09.392
Slashing through the exam,
dominating it!

17:09.927 --> 17:11.811
That's all I care about.

17:12.846 --> 17:16.565
What you need is vigor.

17:17.643 --> 17:19.026
Vigor.

17:20.104 --> 17:21.529
Understand?

17:32.574 --> 17:35.351
So I'll pay you
this time each month.

17:35.452 --> 17:38.629
3 classes a week,
2 hours each, okay?

17:39.481 --> 17:40.481
As for the fee,

17:40.582 --> 17:44.319
I was going to pay Min's rate,
then I added a bit for inflation.

17:44.420 --> 17:45.970
Thank you.

17:47.506 --> 17:49.490
How about a proper introduction?

17:49.591 --> 17:52.518
Da-hye' tutor,
we'll call him Kevin.

17:53.137 --> 17:54.895
Mr. Kevin!

17:55.431 --> 17:58.791
If you feel like snacking during
your lesson, just call me.

17:58.892 --> 18:00.960
If you need anything, ask her.

18:01.061 --> 18:03.654
She knows this house
better than I...

18:03.814 --> 18:07.241
Da-song, stop it!

18:08.052 --> 18:09.052
I'm sorry, did he startle you?

18:09.153 --> 18:11.596
How cute.
His name's Da-song?

18:11.697 --> 18:13.514
Yes, our youngest.

18:13.615 --> 18:15.141
Da-song, come say hi!

18:15.242 --> 18:16.959
This is Mr. Kevin!

18:19.496 --> 18:23.566
This is an Indian arrow.
I ordered it from the U.S.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.969
From last year he's been
an Indian fanatic.

18:29.006 --> 18:30.106
Indians?

18:30.674 --> 18:33.409
He's got a fanboy personality?

18:33.510 --> 18:37.080
Well, he's eccentric
and easily distracted.

18:37.181 --> 18:39.982
he can barely sit still!

18:40.142 --> 18:42.293
So last year I enrolled him
in Cub Scouts.

18:42.394 --> 18:45.338
hoping he'd learn
moderation and focus.

18:45.439 --> 18:46.947
But look.

18:47.983 --> 18:49.158
He's even worse.

18:51.695 --> 18:56.832
His scout leader is an
Indian fanatic, maybe that's why.

18:57.367 --> 19:01.562
The American Indian is
the very spirit of the Cub Scouts.

19:01.663 --> 19:02.605
It's a good thing.

19:02.706 --> 19:05.817
Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?

19:05.918 --> 19:09.112
Sure. I'm a Scout by nature.

19:09.213 --> 19:13.599
Da-song is an artist by nature.
Look at this painting.

19:13.967 --> 19:17.412
ItæŠ¯ so metaphorical.
It's really strong.

19:17.513 --> 19:19.163
Strong, right?

19:19.264 --> 19:21.565
You've got an eye for this.

19:22.684 --> 19:24.168
It's a chimpanzee, right?

19:24.269 --> 19:26.028
A self-portrait.

19:29.066 --> 19:30.866
Sure enough!

19:31.902 --> 19:35.138
The perspective of a young artist
eludes understanding.

19:35.239 --> 19:37.682
Or perhaps it's Da-song's
expressive genius...

19:37.783 --> 19:43.229
Anyway, we've been through
so many art teachers.

19:43.330 --> 19:45.589
None of them lasts even a month.

19:46.625 --> 19:50.219
And Da-song is just
so hard to control.

19:52.756 --> 19:55.224
- Just a moment. Madame.
- Yes?

19:55.759 --> 19:59.145
Someone just came to mind.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.188
What was her name?

20:01.723 --> 20:04.208
Jessica!
Right, Jessica...

20:04.309 --> 20:08.612
She was in the same
art school as my cousin.

20:08.730 --> 20:11.299
What was her Korean name?

20:11.400 --> 20:16.429
Anyway, after studying applied arts
at Illinois State University,

20:16.530 --> 20:18.431
she returned to Korea

20:18.532 --> 20:20.975
Illinois... tell me more.

20:21.076 --> 20:27.465
Her teaching is unusual, but she
knows how to handle kids.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.843
She's got a special
reputation in her field.

20:31.378 --> 20:33.571
But even though her methods
are unique,

20:33.672 --> 20:35.948
she can help kids
get into good art schools.

20:36.049 --> 20:40.186
Now I'm really curious.
What is she like?

20:40.721 --> 20:42.313
Would you like to meet her?

20:42.431 --> 20:45.733
Though I heard
she's in high demand...

20:51.648 --> 20:52.823
Hold on.

20:54.443 --> 20:57.929
Jessica, only child,
Illinois Chicago,

20:58.030 --> 21:01.248
classmate Kim Jin-mo,
he's your cousin.

21:08.540 --> 21:12.151
Look at how he painted
the side dishes on the tablecloth

21:12.252 --> 21:14.654
in this mosaic arrangement.

21:14.755 --> 21:17.448
But within that too,
there are repeating patterns.

21:17.549 --> 21:20.827
Gochujang is red,
the rice... well, anyway,

21:20.928 --> 21:25.940
he has a Basquiat-esque sense,
even at age 9!

21:26.475 --> 21:28.042
How exciting.

21:28.143 --> 21:33.280
I'm sure Miss Jessica must have
already sensed this,

21:33.398 --> 21:37.451
so I'll leave you two,
and go up for Da-hye's lesson.

21:38.070 --> 21:39.679
Have a nice lesson, Jessica.

21:39.780 --> 21:41.747
Yes, thank you
for the introduction.

21:45.786 --> 21:51.298
So as you can see,
Da-song's eccentric genius...

21:53.835 --> 21:54.935
Da-hye.

21:55.379 --> 21:58.681
So we'll start with #38?

22:03.220 --> 22:04.245
Kevin.

22:04.346 --> 22:05.563
Yeah?

22:05.681 --> 22:10.943
Did you know that
Da-song is faking it all?

22:11.061 --> 22:13.671
Huh? What do you mean?

22:13.772 --> 22:15.464
It's all a show.

22:15.565 --> 22:19.302
Acting like a genius, that
4th dimension stuff is all fake.

22:19.403 --> 22:21.036
An artist cosplay.

22:21.571 --> 22:22.830
Da-song?

22:24.366 --> 22:25.600
You know that thing,

22:25.701 --> 22:30.087
when he freezes and stares at
the sky, as if struck by inspiration.

22:30.622 --> 22:36.385
So he's walking along, then he
stares at the clouds for 10 minutes.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.571
So you know what I mean?

22:38.672 --> 22:41.240
He gives me the creeps.

22:41.341 --> 22:44.768
He pretends that he
can't live a normal life.

22:45.304 --> 22:46.621
Makes me want to puke.

22:46.722 --> 22:49.898
So Da-song is pretending...

22:50.475 --> 22:54.653
But what's that got to do with
your studies?

22:58.692 --> 23:02.369
Well, I'm just saying.

23:04.906 --> 23:06.874
Sure, so in that sense,

23:07.951 --> 23:12.296
what you told me about Da-song
was very interesting,

23:12.831 --> 23:14.673
so let's write about it in English.

23:14.791 --> 23:20.888
And be sure to use the word
'pretend' at least twice.

23:21.423 --> 23:24.367
Then, can I ask you a question?

23:24.468 --> 23:25.534
Sure.

23:25.635 --> 23:28.103
That teacher Jessica.

23:29.139 --> 23:35.736
Is she really
your cousin's classmate?

23:37.272 --> 23:38.839
What do you mean?

23:38.940 --> 23:41.325
She's your girlfriend, right?

23:44.363 --> 23:48.457
No way...
I just met her today.

23:52.496 --> 23:55.506
Jessica's really pretty.
isn't she?

23:56.041 --> 23:58.217
Aren't you interested?

23:59.252 --> 24:00.861
You saw her?

24:00.962 --> 24:05.366
Sure, she's pretty.
She's a beautiful woman.

24:05.467 --> 24:06.567
Yeah.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.980
I knew it.

24:12.516 --> 24:14.775
So you are interested.

24:17.312 --> 24:18.946
Da-hye...

24:21.066 --> 24:27.805
So, if we can compare
Jessica to a rose,

24:27.906 --> 24:29.456
then you are...

25:15.537 --> 25:16.896
- Let's study.
- Yes.

25:16.997 --> 25:22.360
Please understand that my boy
has trouble keeping still.

25:22.461 --> 25:23.969
I understand.

25:24.504 --> 25:25.604
Da-song!

25:26.365 --> 25:27.365
Da-song, get up!

25:27.466 --> 25:29.183
Come on, Da-song!

25:30.077 --> 25:31.077
In your butt...

25:31.178 --> 25:34.080
- Madame, please leave us.
- What?

25:34.181 --> 25:36.523
I never teach with
a parent in the room.

25:37.058 --> 25:39.377
But today is our first day,
and as you can see, he's...

25:39.478 --> 25:41.528
Wait downstairs.

25:43.006 --> 25:44.006
Park Da-song?

25:44.107 --> 25:45.324
Da-song!

25:49.362 --> 25:50.788
Madame?

25:51.823 --> 25:53.140
Want some plum extract?

25:53.241 --> 25:54.225
What?

25:54.326 --> 25:57.645
It's mixed with honey.
To ease your tension.

25:57.746 --> 26:00.172
Yeah, that would be great.

26:14.721 --> 26:16.480
- Hey.
- Yes?

26:17.015 --> 26:18.124
I've got an idea.

26:18.225 --> 26:21.485
Take two glasses of plum extract
to Da-song's room.

26:22.020 --> 26:24.755
You're not a parent,
so you can go in!

26:24.856 --> 26:26.298
Oh, that's right!

26:26.399 --> 26:29.260
Then I'll report back
on what's going on in there...

26:29.361 --> 26:32.079
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

26:34.346 --> 26:35.446
What?

26:35.617 --> 26:37.101
They came out?

26:37.202 --> 26:38.752
Yeah.

26:40.872 --> 26:44.049
So you're done already?

26:45.585 --> 26:46.885
Madame.

26:47.420 --> 26:49.388
Come sit next to me.

26:51.424 --> 26:53.058
Da-song, go upstairs.

26:55.095 --> 26:56.195
Hurry up!

27:02.811 --> 27:04.712
Da-son just painted this.

27:04.813 --> 27:06.238
I see...

27:07.774 --> 27:10.259
I'd rather speak with
Madame alone.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.510
Oh, but she is...

27:11.611 --> 27:14.580
No, leave us.

27:18.660 --> 27:24.857
Madame, I told you I study
art psychology and art therapy?

27:24.958 --> 27:26.133
Yes.

27:27.168 --> 27:29.678
Did anything happen to Da-song
in first grade?

27:32.215 --> 27:34.683
To be frank,

27:35.218 --> 27:38.204
before I decide whether
to take on Da-song,

27:38.305 --> 27:41.064
I need to hear about this.

27:41.182 --> 27:45.177
But this is hard for me
to talk about right now.

27:45.278 --> 27:46.128
What to do?

27:46.229 --> 27:47.904
Never mind, then.

27:48.440 --> 27:53.385
The lower-right region of a painting
is called the "schizophrenia zone".

27:53.486 --> 27:55.971
Psychotic symptoms often
reveal themselves here.

27:56.072 --> 27:56.972
Oh, phrenia...

27:57.073 --> 27:58.057
Look here.

27:58.158 --> 28:00.726
Da-song painted this
unusual shape, right?

28:00.827 --> 28:02.044
I see.

28:04.289 --> 28:06.941
Over there, it's the same!
It's the same, right?

28:07.042 --> 28:09.217
Yes, that's correct.

28:09.336 --> 28:13.030
A similar shape in the same zone.
You see it now?

28:13.131 --> 28:14.389
Yes.

28:14.924 --> 28:19.245
I've stared at that painting
at every meal!

28:19.346 --> 28:21.497
But I had no idea.

28:21.598 --> 28:24.733
Calm down.
Let's compose ourselves.

28:25.268 --> 28:28.278
This is all a black box
into Da-song's mind.

28:28.813 --> 28:32.574
Would you like to open
that box with me, Madame?

28:33.610 --> 28:34.843
I want to open it.

28:34.944 --> 28:39.348
Then we'll need 4
two-hour sessions per week,

28:39.449 --> 28:43.686
and this is not simple tutoring,
it's art therapy, right?

28:43.787 --> 28:44.645
Of course.

28:44.746 --> 28:48.632
Because of that my rate is set
at a very high level.

28:49.234 --> 28:50.234
Are you okay with that?

28:50.335 --> 28:52.010
It's my pleasure.

28:53.546 --> 28:55.263
Da-songs dad is home.

29:01.805 --> 29:05.982
Honey, Da-song's new
art teacher is here.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.821
Her name's Jessica,
from Illinois.

29:11.356 --> 29:13.365
Jessica! This is Dong-ik.

29:13.525 --> 29:15.301
- Hello.
- Hi.

29:15.402 --> 29:17.244
Thanks for your help.

29:17.679 --> 29:18.679
Class is over?

29:18.780 --> 29:19.880
Yes, just finished.

29:20.307 --> 29:21.307
- Driver Yoon.
- Yes?

29:21.408 --> 29:22.975
- Are you free?
- Yes, I am.

29:23.076 --> 29:25.644
Then give her a lift, okay?

29:25.745 --> 29:30.190
Sure, we don't want her
going down alone at night, right?

29:30.291 --> 29:31.550
Of course.

29:31.709 --> 29:33.093
Miss Jessica?

29:33.628 --> 29:39.141
Shall I drive you
all the way home, then?

29:40.176 --> 29:42.536
- Which neighborhood?
- No. that's fine.

29:42.637 --> 29:46.440
You can just drop me off
at Hyehwa station.

29:46.583 --> 29:47.583
Thank you.

29:47.684 --> 29:48.959
I don't mind if it's far away.

29:49.060 --> 29:53.255
- My shift is finished, anyway.
- I'll get off at Hyehwa.

29:53.356 --> 29:56.783
Looks like it's going to rain.

29:58.319 --> 30:00.554
Ride the Benz, not the subway!

30:00.655 --> 30:04.124
I'm meeting my boyfriend
at exit 3 of Hyehwa Station!

30:05.660 --> 30:06.760
Yes.

30:41.279 --> 30:45.540
Dad, when you worked as a driver,
did you drive a lot of Benzes?

30:46.075 --> 30:52.422
Benzes? Not then, but I did
when I worked as a valet.

30:52.957 --> 30:55.442
You worked as a valet?

30:55.543 --> 30:59.279
Sure, after the chicken place went bust,
before the Taiwan cake shop,

30:59.380 --> 31:01.198
in that 6-month window?

31:01.299 --> 31:05.101
No, it was after
the cake shop went bust.

31:07.722 --> 31:09.898
We're moving to
the next stage already?

31:10.433 --> 31:14.044
I set a trap in the Benz.

31:14.145 --> 31:16.029
Then we're diving right in.

31:16.564 --> 31:18.465
Wow this is so metaphorical.

31:18.566 --> 31:21.952
Look Dad, we're eating in a
driver's cafeteria right now!

31:22.737 --> 31:24.746
Right, a driver's cafeteria!

31:25.281 --> 31:27.141
Eat as much as you want, kids.

31:27.242 --> 31:30.168
You didn't even pay for it.
they did!

31:30.537 --> 31:33.313
Son, have some more.
Eat up!

31:33.414 --> 31:34.231
Yes, Dad.

31:34.332 --> 31:35.357
Eat your fill!

31:35.458 --> 31:37.693
What did you do
to that woman yesterday?

31:37.794 --> 31:38.444
What?

31:38.545 --> 31:40.237
She was freaking out.

31:40.338 --> 31:42.681
Saying she was so moved,
you put her in shock.

31:42.799 --> 31:44.158
Fuck. I don't know!

31:44.259 --> 31:48.144
I googled "art therapy".
and ad-libbed the rest.

31:48.263 --> 31:50.831
Then suddenly she's weeping.

31:50.932 --> 31:53.316
Crazy bitch,
I couldn't believe it.

32:26.509 --> 32:28.952
Oh, you're home?

32:29.053 --> 32:30.770
Did you eat yet?

32:32.557 --> 32:34.041
Is something wrong?

32:34.142 --> 32:35.459
Is the housekeeper out?

32:35.560 --> 32:37.611
She's walking the dogs.

32:38.187 --> 32:39.613
Honey.

32:40.648 --> 32:42.866
This was under my car seat.

32:45.403 --> 32:47.621
Driver Yoon is such a scumbag.

32:47.780 --> 32:49.080
What is this?

32:50.116 --> 32:51.350
I'm sorry, honey.

32:51.451 --> 32:53.560
I didnæŠ° know he was
this kind of guy.

32:53.661 --> 32:56.755
Don't you pay him well?

32:57.290 --> 33:00.275
Is he saving up by
not paying for a motel?

33:00.376 --> 33:01.818
He must be a pervert.

33:01.919 --> 33:03.195
He likes it in the car.

33:03.296 --> 33:07.199
Oh, that's gross.
In his boss' car!

33:07.300 --> 33:11.937
A young guy's sex life is
his own business, that's all fine.

33:15.475 --> 33:17.984
But why in my car?

33:19.520 --> 33:23.048
And if so, why not in his seat?
Why cross the line like that?

33:23.149 --> 33:24.699
You're right.

33:25.234 --> 33:28.136
Does dripping his sperm
on my seat turn him on?

33:28.237 --> 33:30.413
I can't believe this.

33:34.952 --> 33:39.130
But you know what's
strangest of all?

33:39.791 --> 33:41.007
What?

33:42.043 --> 33:44.361
Usually if you have car sex,

33:44.462 --> 33:49.741
you might leave behind
a strand of hair, or an earring.

33:49.842 --> 33:50.951
Right.

33:51.052 --> 33:54.896
But how can you forget
your own panties?

33:55.431 --> 33:59.317
That's right.
It's hard to overlook.

34:00.353 --> 34:04.614
So it makes me quite suspicious
of this woman's condition.

34:05.650 --> 34:06.866
You get me?

34:16.452 --> 34:18.020
Oh my... meth or cocaine?

34:18.121 --> 34:19.838
Shh! The kids...

34:20.373 --> 34:21.565
What do we do?

34:21.666 --> 34:24.318
What if anyone finds
white powder in your car?

34:24.419 --> 34:27.012
Calm down, relax.

34:27.547 --> 34:29.055
Relax.

34:29.590 --> 34:32.892
For now it's just supposition.
A rational guess.

34:33.428 --> 34:35.078
But no need to call the police.

34:35.179 --> 34:37.022
Not that!

34:37.598 --> 34:43.378
Still, for a busy man like me to ask,
"Why are you fucking in my car?"

34:43.479 --> 34:44.588
Exactly.

34:44.689 --> 34:46.506
So instead...

34:46.607 --> 34:51.637
Can you just invent some
bland excuse to let him go?

34:51.738 --> 34:53.096
Okay sure.

34:53.197 --> 34:56.558
No need to mention
panties or car sex.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.644
We don't need to stoop
to that level, do we?

34:58.745 --> 35:00.754
Surely not!

35:01.289 --> 35:04.149
But what if he goes online
and accuses us...

35:04.250 --> 35:06.259
Just give him a good severance.

35:06.794 --> 35:10.072
How was Da-song today?

35:10.173 --> 35:12.265
He was fine.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.910
- So class is finished?
- Yes.

35:15.011 --> 35:17.579
Jessica, the last time you came,

35:17.680 --> 35:20.123
our driver gave you a ride, right?

35:20.224 --> 35:21.083
That's right.

35:21.184 --> 35:23.543
This may be an odd question,

35:23.644 --> 35:25.528
but nothing happened then?

35:25.646 --> 35:27.005
No, he was very nice.

35:27.106 --> 35:28.966
I told him to go
to Hyehwa Station,

35:29.067 --> 35:32.344
but he insisted on
driving me home.

35:32.445 --> 35:35.597
That jerk!
He took you home late at night?

35:35.698 --> 35:37.374
Revealing where you live?

35:38.409 --> 35:40.686
No, I got off at Hyehwa.

35:40.787 --> 35:43.146
Oh, good girl. Very good.

35:43.247 --> 35:44.815
Jessica nice...

35:44.916 --> 35:47.275
Did something happen with him?

35:47.376 --> 35:52.572
He won't be working for us any more.
A slightly shameful incident.

35:52.673 --> 35:54.616
What incident?

35:54.717 --> 35:57.685
Oh, you don't need to know.

35:59.222 --> 36:02.833
But I'm surprised.
He was so gentlemanly and cool.

36:02.934 --> 36:06.253
Jessica, you're too
young and innocent!

36:06.354 --> 36:08.446
You have a lot to learn about people.

36:09.482 --> 36:14.052
But we were excited to have
such a young, hip driver, too.

36:14.153 --> 36:17.347
But isn't an older driver better?

36:17.448 --> 36:21.435
That's true. They drive better,
have better manners.

36:21.536 --> 36:24.187
My father's brother had
a driver just like that.

36:24.288 --> 36:28.734
Mr. Kim.
He was so congenial and nice,

36:28.835 --> 36:31.361
I used to call him Uncle
when I was young.

36:31.462 --> 36:33.447
You know a man like that?

36:33.548 --> 36:36.599
Yes, he was so mild-mannered.

36:37.135 --> 36:41.896
Oh, but my relatives
relocated to Chicago.

36:42.974 --> 36:45.167
I wonder if
Mr. Kim's free now?

36:45.268 --> 36:49.254
I'm really interested!
Could I meet him?

36:49.355 --> 36:50.422
Really?

36:50.523 --> 36:52.907
I don't trust anyone now.

36:53.442 --> 36:56.344
I only trust someone recommended
by a person I know well.

36:56.445 --> 37:01.124
But if you've known him so long,
I'd feel much more at ease.

37:03.703 --> 37:05.753
Do you really want to meet him?

37:06.289 --> 37:07.797
I'm deadly serious.

37:08.332 --> 37:11.885
This chain of
recommendations is best.

37:12.420 --> 37:13.636
How should I describe it?

37:13.796 --> 37:15.221
A belt of trust?

37:15.740 --> 37:16.740
- This one's different.
- Here.

37:16.841 --> 37:17.407
Oh, right.

37:17.508 --> 37:19.142
And this one.

37:19.260 --> 37:20.786
Looks like a touch screen now.

37:20.887 --> 37:23.789
It's not touch,
it says you have to turn it.

37:23.890 --> 37:25.940
Wow, this thing?

37:26.375 --> 37:27.375
Sir?

37:27.476 --> 37:29.819
Taking our time, are we?

37:32.417 --> 37:34.246
This is a nice car.

37:37.195 --> 37:38.411
This is en
it! Come over here.

37:42.116 --> 37:43.666
He's in a meeting now.

37:48.706 --> 37:50.715
Have a seat and wait here.

37:59.342 --> 38:02.810
Hello, nice to meet...

38:05.932 --> 38:07.415
But is it compatible
with a phone?

38:07.516 --> 38:14.197
Oh, not with a phone.
You need more computing power.

38:15.316 --> 38:19.953
This isn't any sort of test,
so don't be nervous.

38:20.696 --> 38:23.748
I was worn out at the office,
so I came out for a bit.

38:24.283 --> 38:25.433
I understand.

38:25.534 --> 38:30.129
Constant chatter, all that bother.
At least the car is peaceful.

38:32.541 --> 38:33.841
Thank you.

38:34.877 --> 38:36.069
You seem to know the road well?

38:36.170 --> 38:39.489
Anything below the 38th parallel.

38:39.590 --> 38:42.850
After 30 years behind the wheel,
the car almost drives itself.

38:43.386 --> 38:46.020
I respect those who work
in one field for a long time.

38:46.264 --> 38:49.249
Well, to be honest
this is a simple vocation.

38:49.350 --> 38:52.360
But... the head of a household,

38:52.895 --> 38:54.045
the leader of a company?

38:54.146 --> 38:59.659
Or else just a lonely man setting off
on the road each morning...

39:00.528 --> 39:02.287
It's companionship of a sort,

39:02.446 --> 39:05.348
so that's how
I've approached each day.

39:05.449 --> 39:07.333
The years sure pass quickly.

39:11.038 --> 39:13.673
Sure enough,
your cornering is excellent.

39:14.375 --> 39:20.739
Well, it may look simple,
but it's one of the fundamentals.

39:20.840 --> 39:25.602
<i>She may look like a sheep,
but inside, she's a fox.</i>

39:25.720 --> 39:28.813
<i>Sometimes she acts like
she owns the house.</i>

39:29.332 --> 39:30.332
<i>Right.</i>

39:30.433 --> 39:34.920
<i>Of all the people in that house,
she's lived there the longest.</i>

39:35.021 --> 39:38.673
<i>She was housekeeper
to the architect Namgoong,</i>

39:38.774 --> 39:43.453
<i>but then she went on
to work for this family.</i>

39:43.988 --> 39:45.347
<i>When the architect moved out,</i>

39:45.448 --> 39:48.350
<i>he introduced this woman
to Park's family,</i>

39:48.451 --> 39:51.794
<i>telling them, "This is a great
housekeeper, you should hire her."</i>

39:51.912 --> 39:55.232
<i>So she survived
a change of ownership.</i>

39:55.333 --> 39:58.384
She won't give up good job easily.

39:58.919 --> 40:02.055
To extract a woman like that,
we need to prepare well.

40:03.758 --> 40:06.100
Right, we need a plan.

40:07.136 --> 40:10.688
I want to eat peaches.
I like peaches best.

40:11.223 --> 40:12.332
Why not ask for some?

40:12.433 --> 40:16.194
No peaches at our house.
It's a forbidden fruit.

40:23.861 --> 40:26.721
<i>So according to what
Da-hye told me,</i>

40:26.822 --> 40:31.434
<i>she's got a massively serious
allergy to peaches.</i>

40:31.535 --> 40:34.771
<i>You know that fuzz
on a peach's skin?</i>

40:34.872 --> 40:38.483
<i>If she's anywhere near it,
she gets a full body rash,</i>

40:38.584 --> 40:42.553
<i>has trouble breathing,
asthma, a total meltdown!</i>

40:47.093 --> 40:51.229
No no, there weren't
any peaches anywhere.

40:52.890 --> 40:55.358
That's what I'm saying!

40:55.601 --> 40:58.086
Usually when I get
symptoms like this,

40:58.187 --> 41:01.589
I run to my room
and take my medicine,

41:01.690 --> 41:07.053
but it was so sudden,
I wasn't sure where I left it.

41:07.154 --> 41:12.183
Madame, this woman
behind me, is that?

41:12.284 --> 41:14.185
Oh, it's our housekeeper!

41:14.286 --> 41:16.938
So it's true.
Oh, how sad.

41:17.039 --> 41:20.025
I wasn't sure if that
was really her.

41:20.126 --> 41:23.886
I've only seen her a couple times
in the living room.

41:24.422 --> 41:26.406
This was in the hospital?

41:26.507 --> 41:30.435
A few days ago I went for
my annual medical exam.

41:30.970 --> 41:34.981
I took a selfie for my wife,
and there she was behind me.

41:35.474 --> 41:37.483
Is she talking
on the phone there?

41:37.685 --> 41:42.839
Anyway. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop...

41:42.940 --> 41:44.758
but her words came through clearly!

41:44.859 --> 41:46.593
- So I couldn't help but..
- Cut, cut!

41:46.694 --> 41:49.554
Dad, your emotions are up to here.

41:49.655 --> 41:51.914
Bring them down to about there.

41:52.450 --> 41:54.893
...so I couldn't help but overhear.

41:54.994 --> 41:57.754
Keep it focused!

41:59.290 --> 42:01.566
What I'm trying to say is,
it's just that,

42:01.667 --> 42:05.887
your housekeeper's voice
is quite loud, you know?

42:06.046 --> 42:09.574
I understand, it's all right.
Just tell me, okay?

42:09.675 --> 42:12.494
She said she got diagnosed
with active TB,

42:12.595 --> 42:14.662
and she was shouting
on the phone,

42:14.763 --> 42:17.832
so upset she could
barely control herself!

42:17.933 --> 42:20.251
Tuberculosis? Come on...

42:20.352 --> 42:25.698
It's true, she phoned someone
saying she had active TB.

42:26.233 --> 42:30.828
Do people still get TB?

42:31.022 --> 42:32.122
Dad...

42:32.364 --> 42:37.352
Back in the day, people used
to buy Christmas Seals, right?

42:37.453 --> 42:38.770
Feels like a bygone era.

42:38.871 --> 42:40.522
But I saw it on the internet.

42:40.623 --> 42:44.442
Korea has the #1 rate of TB
of all the OECD countries.

42:44.543 --> 42:48.071
But she's still working,
as if nothing's wrong.

42:48.172 --> 42:50.115
With a kid like Da-song
in the house.

42:50.216 --> 42:53.493
So you've got a young kid
like Da-song in the house,

42:53.594 --> 42:56.830
and a TB patient is doing dishes,
cooking, spraying spittle...

42:56.931 --> 42:58.564
Stop it, please!

43:02.853 --> 43:04.862
Dad: arriving in 3 mins.

43:51.402 --> 43:55.413
If you get the chance,
this'll be icing on the cake.

44:25.603 --> 44:27.295
Madame

44:27.396 --> 44:30.781
2nd floor sauna room.

44:40.826 --> 44:42.418
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

44:44.563 --> 44:45.563
Mr. Kim.

44:45.664 --> 44:49.734
Please don't tell any of this
to my husband, okay?

44:49.835 --> 44:50.860
Understood.

44:50.961 --> 44:55.640
If he hears I brought a
TB patient to our home,

44:55.799 --> 44:58.535
I'll be hanged and quartered!

44:58.636 --> 45:00.537
Don't worry, Madame.

45:00.638 --> 45:04.249
And if I may presume
to say one thing.

45:04.350 --> 45:07.652
I have no feelings
against that woman.

45:08.187 --> 45:15.276
I felt I had to speak up for the
sake of public health and hygiene.

45:15.653 --> 45:19.180
But this could be seen
as snitching or...

45:19.281 --> 45:20.682
Don't you worry.

45:20.783 --> 45:23.351
I won't mention the TB.

45:23.452 --> 45:25.895
I'll just make up some excuse
to dismiss her.

45:25.996 --> 45:27.505
Simply and quietly.

45:29.124 --> 45:31.818
It's a proven method.
That's the best.

45:31.919 --> 45:33.844
Okay, then.

45:44.890 --> 45:48.067
Have you...
washed your hands?

46:33.564 --> 46:37.634
Mr. Kim, do you know
a good braised ribs place?

46:37.735 --> 46:39.385
Somewhere close by.

46:39.486 --> 46:40.845
Sure.

46:40.946 --> 46:44.707
- Then you'll be eating out?
- That's right.

46:45.325 --> 46:48.252
Why such a craving for
braised ribs today?

46:48.787 --> 46:51.672
Our old housekeeper made
delicious ribs.

46:52.708 --> 46:54.776
The one who quit this week?

46:54.877 --> 46:59.847
My wife wouldn't even
tell me why she quit.

47:02.468 --> 47:07.855
Sure, it's easy enough
to hire a new one.

47:08.891 --> 47:13.503
Still, it's a shame.
She was a great housekeeper

47:13.604 --> 47:14.504
I see.

47:14.605 --> 47:17.173
She kept the house
in great shape,

47:17.274 --> 47:19.950
and she knew never to
cross the line.

47:20.486 --> 47:23.370
I can't stand people
who cross the line.

47:23.906 --> 47:26.582
Perhaps just one weak point?

47:27.201 --> 47:28.685
Eating too much.

47:28.786 --> 47:31.712
She always ate enough for two.

47:32.372 --> 47:36.234
But considering
all the work she did...

47:36.335 --> 47:41.698
Then you better find someone new.
A new housekeeper.

47:41.799 --> 47:43.825
We're in trouble now.

47:43.926 --> 47:48.395
In a week,
our house will be a trash can.

47:49.431 --> 47:52.441
My clothes will start to smell.

47:53.477 --> 47:56.379
My wife has no talent
for housework.

47:56.480 --> 47:59.782
She's bad at cleaning,
and her cooking's awful.

48:00.818 --> 48:02.701
Still, you love her, right?

48:10.369 --> 48:13.712
Of course.
I love her.

48:14.748 --> 48:16.632
We'll call it love.

48:18.252 --> 48:20.427
Then would this help?

48:24.466 --> 48:26.659
The Care?
What is this?

48:26.760 --> 48:29.245
I just recently
found out about them.

48:29.346 --> 48:34.191
How to describe it?
It's like a membership service.

48:34.768 --> 48:41.299
The company provides veteran-grade
help to VIP customers such as you.

48:41.400 --> 48:47.305
For example maids, caregivers.
or drivers like myself.

48:47.406 --> 48:50.624
You can tell from the card
they're high-class.

48:51.159 --> 48:52.751
Cool design.

48:53.829 --> 48:55.813
Then how do you
know about this company?

48:55.914 --> 49:00.443
They contacted me
as a veteran-grade driver.

49:00.544 --> 49:02.761
You might say they scouted me?

49:04.298 --> 49:10.036
But when their call came I had
already arranged to meet with you.

49:10.137 --> 49:13.314
I see...

49:14.349 --> 49:17.610
You turned down this
famous company to work for me.

49:18.145 --> 49:19.570
I won't forget that.

49:21.106 --> 49:23.324
Son of a bitch!

49:25.360 --> 49:29.222
Anyway, I can give this card
to my wife, right?

49:29.323 --> 49:31.098
Yes, that's why I brought it up.

49:31.199 --> 49:33.375
No need to mention me.

49:34.786 --> 49:37.963
You can tell her
you found the company yourself.

49:38.498 --> 49:39.857
Sure.

49:39.958 --> 49:42.318
Thanks to you I can
play the good husband.

49:42.419 --> 49:47.198
On the back, there's
a number for consultations.

49:47.299 --> 49:48.449
Tell her to call there...

49:48.550 --> 49:50.100
Eyes on the road!

49:55.140 --> 49:58.359
Hello, this is Senior Advisor Yeo
of The Care.

49:58.518 --> 50:01.987
Yes, this is The Care's main office?

50:02.773 --> 50:06.175
If she wanted, she'd be
a fucking great con artist.

50:06.276 --> 50:08.911
Isn't her voice tone great?
Takes after me.

50:10.447 --> 50:12.974
From what I've heard,
it's a full membership service?

50:13.075 --> 50:16.936
So you're not currently
a member, I assume?

50:17.037 --> 50:19.564
That's right,
What steps do I need to take?

50:19.665 --> 50:23.776
We'll just need to receive
a few documents from you.

50:23.877 --> 50:26.863
Are you ready to write this down?

50:26.964 --> 50:31.850
Your family register,
citizenship ID cards...

50:32.552 --> 50:35.496
documents to prove
your income level,

50:35.597 --> 50:38.040
i.e the title to your property, etc.

50:38.141 --> 50:40.567
Our property title?
Yes.

50:49.111 --> 50:50.428
Wow, peaches!

50:50.529 --> 50:52.663
You have some too, Mr. Kevin.

50:52.781 --> 50:54.123
Thank you.

51:02.624 --> 51:05.651
Leave it outside the door
next time.

51:05.752 --> 51:07.886
- And knock!
- Yes.

51:10.465 --> 51:12.074
No entering during my lesson!

51:12.175 --> 51:13.600
Yes, miss!

51:15.679 --> 51:17.079
Park Da-song!

51:17.180 --> 51:18.414
Daddy!

51:18.515 --> 51:19.982
Where are you?

51:24.521 --> 51:25.546
Daddy!

51:25.647 --> 51:26.505
Son!

51:26.606 --> 51:29.508
Walkie talkies!

51:29.609 --> 51:30.601
Walkie talkies!

51:30.702 --> 51:33.746
Who do you like better,
your dad or the walkie talkie?

51:34.081 --> 51:37.350
Da-song, how could you
run out from your lesson?

51:37.451 --> 51:41.020
When did you buy all this?

51:41.121 --> 51:42.063
It's no big deal.

51:42.164 --> 51:43.264
Huh?

51:46.117 --> 51:47.348
Huh?

51:47.859 --> 51:49.565
What is it?

51:52.090 --> 51:53.557
What's he doing now?

51:54.393 --> 51:55.785
Da-song, don't do that!

51:55.886 --> 51:59.705
It's the same!
They smell the same!

51:59.806 --> 52:03.417
What are you talking about?
Go up to Jessica.

52:03.518 --> 52:07.571
Jessica smells like that, too.

52:08.607 --> 52:11.926
So do we all need to use
different soap, now?

52:12.027 --> 52:15.888
Dad, we'll need to use
different laundry soap, too.

52:15.989 --> 52:17.098
And fabric softener.

52:17.199 --> 52:21.519
You mean doing four separate
loads of laundry each time?

52:21.620 --> 52:23.545
That's not it.

52:24.164 --> 52:26.382
It's the semi-basement smell.

52:27.417 --> 52:30.219
We need to leave this home
to lose the smell.

52:31.880 --> 52:37.868
Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be
worrying about things like this?

52:37.969 --> 52:38.995
Sure.

52:39.096 --> 52:42.206
In an age like ours,

52:42.307 --> 52:47.003
when an opening for a security guard
attracts 500 university graduates.

52:47.104 --> 52:50.364
Our entire family got hired!

52:50.899 --> 52:52.533
That's right, Dad!

52:53.068 --> 52:55.511
If we put our 4 salaries together?

52:55.612 --> 52:59.957
The amount of cash coming from
that house into ours is immense!

53:00.534 --> 53:05.062
Let's offer a prayer of gratitude
to the great Mr. Park.

53:05.163 --> 53:06.272
And to Min!

53:06.373 --> 53:09.025
Ki-woo, that friend of yours
turned into such a fine guy,

53:09.126 --> 53:13.429
and thanks to him we're all...
Fuck, not again!

53:17.993 --> 53:18.993
That asshole's dead.

53:19.094 --> 53:21.620
Ki-woo's on the rampage!

53:21.721 --> 53:24.398
Don't overdo it!

53:25.433 --> 53:27.985
Use this instead.

53:31.523 --> 53:33.157
Damn you!

53:35.694 --> 53:36.927
Get a fucking grip!

53:37.028 --> 53:38.954
Get a grip!

53:40.991 --> 53:42.749
Wow!

53:46.788 --> 53:49.214
It's a deluge!

54:05.682 --> 54:09.460
Current weather is clear, over.
The clouds are moving.

54:09.561 --> 54:11.962
But they're not rain clouds, over.

54:12.063 --> 54:13.422
I hear you, over.

54:13.523 --> 54:19.845
Currently your sister's lip
is pouting like a duck's bill.

54:19.946 --> 54:22.932
She's super annoyed, over.

54:23.033 --> 54:27.770
Can't I stay home and study English?
And call Kevin?

54:27.871 --> 54:31.232
Hey! Don't make a scene
just as we're leaving.

54:31.333 --> 54:33.651
If we have to go,
let's have fun.

54:33.752 --> 54:36.403
Da-hye, this is no
ordinary camping trip.

54:36.504 --> 54:37.238
That's right!

54:37.339 --> 54:39.164
How could you miss
your brother's birthday?

54:39.265 --> 54:40.157
No way!

54:40.258 --> 54:42.535
Even your busy father
is taking time off to go.

54:42.636 --> 54:45.562
Right! If you don't go,
you'll regret it!

54:47.891 --> 54:50.042
Oh, right.
You know the beam projector?

54:50.143 --> 54:51.085
The outdoor theater?

54:51.186 --> 54:53.362
Right, bring the outdoor
beam projector.

54:53.855 --> 54:58.342
And look for Da-song's
camping raincoat.

54:58.443 --> 55:00.369
He loves it when it rains.

55:00.904 --> 55:04.598
You remember now?
Zoonie, Berry, and Fofoo.

55:04.699 --> 55:05.766
Zoome and Berry get this.

55:05.867 --> 55:08.686
Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.

55:08.787 --> 55:11.255
Right, and for Foofoo...

55:11.790 --> 55:12.982
Kam-kamaboko.
Japanese crab sticks.

55:13.083 --> 55:14.108
Yes.

55:14.209 --> 55:17.152
When you walk Zoonie,
give him a long leash.

55:17.253 --> 55:19.613
He needs to run around
to feel happy.

55:19.714 --> 55:23.141
He's like the canine version
of Da-song!

55:48.702 --> 55:50.477
Son!

55:50.578 --> 55:53.606
Why are you lying down outside?

55:53.707 --> 55:56.591
Isn't he hot out there?

55:57.127 --> 56:01.847
I'm gazing at the sky from home.

56:03.383 --> 56:04.975
It's so great.

56:08.513 --> 56:10.497
Mom, want some water?

56:10.598 --> 56:12.041
There's sparkling, right?

56:12.142 --> 56:14.627
Ki-jung, some water?

56:14.728 --> 56:16.862
Telepathy... thank you.

56:39.002 --> 56:40.594
Whoa.

56:42.756 --> 56:45.766
Wow, all these
varieties or alcohol.

56:46.885 --> 56:50.245
Dad! Let me add
another to the mix!

56:50.346 --> 56:54.858
This is pretty classy.

56:55.393 --> 57:00.547
Rain falling on the lawn,
as we sip our whiskey...

57:00.648 --> 57:05.369
Ki-woo, what's that yellow
notebook you've been carrying?

57:06.029 --> 57:09.473
This? It's Da-hye's diary.

57:09.574 --> 57:11.058
Her diary?

57:11.159 --> 57:15.420
What a scumbag.
How could you read her diary?

57:15.955 --> 57:21.235
Just so we can
understand each other deeper.

57:21.336 --> 57:24.054
Fuck, are you two dating?

57:24.214 --> 57:28.683
I'm serious.
She really likes me too.

57:30.470 --> 57:32.062
Awhile back...

57:33.098 --> 57:34.356
Never mind.

57:35.391 --> 57:38.293
When she enters university.
I'll officially ask her out.

57:38.394 --> 57:39.778
Seriously.

57:44.359 --> 57:46.410
My son!

57:46.569 --> 57:51.164
Then this house will be
your in-laws' house?

57:53.560 --> 57:54.560
That's right.

57:54.661 --> 57:58.480
Fuck, then I'm washing dishes
at my daughter-in-law's?

57:58.581 --> 58:02.259
Sure, washing your
daughter-in-law's socks!

58:13.805 --> 58:19.251
I like her.
She's a good kid.

58:19.352 --> 58:23.655
She's pretty,
but she's not wild.

58:24.691 --> 58:28.869
Well, now that
we're daydreaming...

58:29.946 --> 58:32.556
If Da-hye and I marry,

58:32.657 --> 58:36.501
we can bring in actors
to be my mom and dad.

58:37.479 --> 58:38.479
Look at her.

58:38.580 --> 58:42.441
She got so many jobs
acting in weddings last year.

58:42.542 --> 58:46.862
even caught the bouquet
from a bitch I've never met.

58:46.963 --> 58:49.948
If you get the bouquet,
they pay an extra $10.

58:50.049 --> 58:52.076
That's how your acting
got so good!

58:52.177 --> 58:57.664
Acting is one thing, but this
family is so gullible, right?

58:57.765 --> 58:59.958
The madame especially.

59:00.059 --> 59:02.068
You said it.

59:03.605 --> 59:07.174
She's so naive, and nice.

59:07.275 --> 59:09.176
She's rich, but still nice.

59:09.277 --> 59:11.637
Not "rich, but still nice."

59:11.738 --> 59:15.665
"Nice because she's rich."
You know?

59:16.201 --> 59:22.714
Hell, if I had all this money.

59:23.750 --> 59:27.653
I'd be nice too!

59:27.754 --> 59:29.262
Even nicer!

59:29.422 --> 59:31.740
That's true.
Your mom's right.

59:31.841 --> 59:34.243
Rich people are naive.
No resentments.

59:34.344 --> 59:36.620
No creases on them.

59:36.721 --> 59:40.124
It all gets ironed out.
Money is an iron.

59:40.225 --> 59:42.626
Those creases all get smoothed out.

59:42.727 --> 59:44.277
Hey, Ki-woo.

59:44.896 --> 59:49.950
You know that driver, Yoon?
Was it Yoon?

59:50.485 --> 59:52.719
The driver before me.

59:52.820 --> 59:54.012
Yeah, Yoon.

59:54.113 --> 59:58.684
He must be working
somewhere else now, right?

59:58.785 --> 1:00:01.103
Sure, he must be.

1:00:01.204 --> 1:00:04.798
He's young, got a nice physique.

1:00:05.333 --> 1:00:08.402
He must've found a better job.

1:00:08.503 --> 1:00:10.595
Fucking hell!

1:00:11.130 --> 1:00:13.615
What's with her now?

1:00:13.716 --> 1:00:20.188
We're the ones who need help.
Worry about us, okay?

1:00:20.306 --> 1:00:23.709
Dad! Come on, Dad!

1:00:23.810 --> 1:00:28.130
Just focus on us, okay?
On us!

1:00:28.231 --> 1:00:32.551
Not Driver Yoon, but me, please.

1:00:32.652 --> 1:00:34.887
Awesome timing, huh?

1:00:34.988 --> 1:00:39.082
She speaks,
and the lightning crashes!

1:00:40.743 --> 1:00:43.837
Hey, Jessica. Cheers.

1:00:44.872 --> 1:00:50.319
Hey, when I went up before,
and you were in the bath...

1:00:50.420 --> 1:00:52.345
What about it?

1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:56.283
How to put it?
You fit in here.

1:00:56.384 --> 1:00:59.019
This rich house suits you.
Not like us.

1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:00.120
Fuck off.

1:01:00.221 --> 1:01:01.079
I'm serious!

1:01:01.180 --> 1:01:02.831
Dad, before...

1:01:02.932 --> 1:01:05.817
She was lying back in the tub,
watching TV.

1:01:06.352 --> 1:01:08.903
Like she's lived here for years.

1:01:10.481 --> 1:01:16.428
Speaking of which,
if this became our house,

1:01:16.529 --> 1:01:20.766
if we lived here,
which room would you want?

1:01:20.867 --> 1:01:26.063
What room in this masterwork
by the great Namgoong?

1:01:26.164 --> 1:01:28.023
Fuck, I don't know.

1:01:28.124 --> 1:01:31.926
Get me the house first.
Then I'll think about it.

1:01:32.462 --> 1:01:34.596
We live here now, don't we?

1:01:35.131 --> 1:01:38.933
Getting drunk in the living room.

1:01:39.052 --> 1:01:41.787
Right, we live here.
Why not?

1:01:41.888 --> 1:01:46.541
This is our home right now.
It's cosy.

1:01:46.642 --> 1:01:49.628
Cosy?
Are you feeling cosy?

1:01:49.729 --> 1:01:54.824
Sure, but suppose Park
walked through that door now.

1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:56.677
What about your dad?

1:01:56.778 --> 1:02:00.413
He'd run and hide
like a cockroach.

1:02:00.948 --> 1:02:03.100
Kids, you know at our house,

1:02:03.201 --> 1:02:08.939
when you turn on the light,
and the cockroaches scatter?

1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:10.924
You know what I mean?

1:02:11.501 --> 1:02:14.844
I'm getting fucking tired of this.

1:02:15.380 --> 1:02:17.263
- A cockroach?
- Yeah.

1:02:20.802 --> 1:02:22.661
Huh? What's wrong?

1:02:22.762 --> 1:02:23.870
What's the matter?

1:02:23.971 --> 1:02:27.982
Dad, don't do that.
You only live once.

1:02:35.024 --> 1:02:36.717
What the hell?

1:02:36.818 --> 1:02:38.427
I fooled you! Didn't I?

1:02:38.528 --> 1:02:39.845
Jesus, Dad.

1:02:39.946 --> 1:02:44.016
I fooled you too, Ki-woo?
Did it look for real?

1:02:44.117 --> 1:02:47.811
If it was for real,
I'd fucking kill you.

1:02:47.912 --> 1:02:51.965
What is this?
Fucking puppy.

1:02:57.505 --> 1:02:59.740
Who is it at this hour'?

1:02:59.841 --> 1:03:01.725
What is it?

1:03:07.890 --> 1:03:08.999
What's she doing here?

1:03:09.100 --> 1:03:12.193
The old housekeeper?

1:03:12.728 --> 1:03:14.571
What's she here for?

1:03:15.106 --> 1:03:18.992
She won't stop ringing it.

1:03:20.027 --> 1:03:22.912
Raising a racket.

1:03:23.890 --> 1:03:24.890
Who is it?

1:03:24.991 --> 1:03:29.811
Oh, hello! I'm...

1:03:29.912 --> 1:03:31.521
The madame's not in, right?

1:03:31.622 --> 1:03:32.522
What?

1:03:32.623 --> 1:03:37.218
I worked here
for a very long time.

1:03:37.753 --> 1:03:43.283
Above the monitor there,
you see a photo of 3 dogs, right?

1:03:43.384 --> 1:03:44.826
Zoome, Berry, Foofoo.

1:03:44.927 --> 1:03:49.456
I get it, but why are you here?

1:03:49.557 --> 1:03:54.194
You're my successor
as housekeeper, right?

1:03:59.233 --> 1:04:00.992
Anyway...

1:04:01.527 --> 1:04:04.805
I'm very sorry to
call on you so late.

1:04:04.906 --> 1:04:06.790
It's just that...

1:04:07.325 --> 1:04:14.088
I forgot something in the
basement under the kitchen.

1:04:14.624 --> 1:04:21.012
When I left,
they pushed me out so quickly...

1:04:24.091 --> 1:04:26.267
Would you let me in?

1:04:28.304 --> 1:04:30.396
What do we do?

1:04:30.932 --> 1:04:33.191
This isn't in the plan.

1:04:40.733 --> 1:04:42.450
Sorry for the trouble.

1:04:43.010 --> 1:04:44.010
This way.

1:04:44.111 --> 1:04:45.745
Yes, thank you.

1:04:47.782 --> 1:04:49.724
You can put your raincoat...

1:04:49.825 --> 1:04:52.418
It'll just be a second.

1:04:52.995 --> 1:04:56.648
Quite a meal there.
That'll be a job to clean up.

1:04:56.749 --> 1:05:00.134
But what did you leave below?

1:05:04.674 --> 1:05:07.267
Want to come down with me?

1:05:08.302 --> 1:05:11.646
Well, just go ahead.

1:06:04.734 --> 1:06:08.077
Help me push this!

1:06:08.195 --> 1:06:10.680
Pull it! From over there.

1:06:10.781 --> 1:06:12.349
What?

1:06:12.450 --> 1:06:13.550
Pull!

1:06:16.370 --> 1:06:17.921
Pull it hard!

1:06:21.459 --> 1:06:22.967
Are you okay?

1:06:24.503 --> 1:06:25.803
Did I scare you?

1:06:28.341 --> 1:06:29.891
Thank you!

1:06:30.968 --> 1:06:32.393
Thank you.

1:06:40.378 --> 1:06:41.378
Honey!

1:06:41.479 --> 1:06:42.612
What the hell?

1:06:44.148 --> 1:06:45.215
Hey!

1:06:45.316 --> 1:06:46.866
Honey!

1:06:47.902 --> 1:06:49.452
Honey!

1:06:51.847 --> 1:06:52.847
Wait!

1:06:52.948 --> 1:06:55.141
Honey, I'm here!

1:06:55.242 --> 1:06:56.542
What is all this?

1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:00.180
Honey!

1:07:00.456 --> 1:07:02.107
Honey, I'm fine.

1:07:02.208 --> 1:07:03.967
No you're not!

1:07:04.068 --> 1:07:05.068
I'm fine, really.

1:07:05.169 --> 1:07:06.403
How can you say that?

1:07:06.504 --> 1:07:08.280
But I'm really hungry.

1:07:08.381 --> 1:07:09.281
Suck it!

1:07:09.382 --> 1:07:12.617
How many days has it been?

1:07:12.718 --> 1:07:14.435
You must've been so hungry!

1:07:16.472 --> 1:07:17.747
It's okay.

1:07:17.848 --> 1:07:20.542
She's a nice woman.
She let me in.

1:07:20.643 --> 1:07:22.752
There was an iron plate,
for grilling meat.

1:07:22.853 --> 1:07:24.296
It was wedged under the shelf.

1:07:24.397 --> 1:07:25.463
So that's why.

1:07:25.564 --> 1:07:28.967
I couldn't open it from the inside.

1:07:29.068 --> 1:07:32.578
- What's going on here?
- I know you must be startled.

1:07:32.697 --> 1:07:35.289
I would be too in this situation.

1:07:35.408 --> 1:07:39.936
But as two fellow workers...
Right, Chung-sook?

1:07:40.037 --> 1:07:42.880
How do you know my name?

1:07:43.416 --> 1:07:48.111
To be honest I'm still texting
with the boy Da-song.

1:07:48.212 --> 1:07:52.782
I knew they were going camping,
so I came today.

1:07:52.883 --> 1:07:55.660
I wanted to speak to you alone.

1:07:55.761 --> 1:07:56.936
Talking about.

1:07:59.473 --> 1:08:01.791
Don't worry, Chung-sook.

1:08:01.892 --> 1:08:05.629
I cut the wire
on the CCTV by the gate.

1:08:05.730 --> 1:08:09.341
Nobody knows I came.
Isn't that good, sis?

1:08:09.442 --> 1:08:11.509
Don't call me sis!

1:08:11.610 --> 1:08:14.579
Sis, my name is Moon-gwang.

1:08:15.114 --> 1:08:19.184
This is my hubbie Oh Geun-sae.
Say hello, honey.

1:08:19.285 --> 1:08:22.604
This tastes great.
What happened to your face?

1:08:22.705 --> 1:08:25.548
I'll tell you later.

1:08:26.125 --> 1:08:30.028
So you'd steal food every day
while working in the kitchen.

1:08:30.129 --> 1:08:31.154
Feeding your husband.

1:08:31.255 --> 1:08:35.909
Not at all! I bought
all his food with my salary.

1:08:36.010 --> 1:08:39.079
That's so unfair!

1:08:39.180 --> 1:08:41.790
But how long has
your husband been down here?

1:08:41.891 --> 1:08:44.734
Hold on a sec.
4 years?

1:08:45.269 --> 1:08:47.921
4 years, 3 months and 17 days.

1:08:48.022 --> 1:08:49.989
Right, it's June now.

1:08:50.524 --> 1:08:56.412
Four years ago when
Mr. Namgoong moved to Paris,

1:08:56.572 --> 1:08:59.582
in the time before
Mr. Park's family moved in,

1:08:59.742 --> 1:09:03.186
I brought my husband down here.

1:09:03.287 --> 1:09:08.316
Many rich houses have secret bunkers,
where you can hide

1:09:08.417 --> 1:09:12.946
in case North Korea attacks,
or if creditors break in.

1:09:13.047 --> 1:09:19.227
But it seems Mr. Namgoong was
a bit embarrassed about this,

1:09:19.386 --> 1:09:23.248
because he never mentioned it
to Mr. Park's family.

1:09:23.349 --> 1:09:24.666
So only I know about it.

1:09:24.767 --> 1:09:27.252
So thatæŠ¯ how it happened.

1:09:27.353 --> 1:09:31.464
But now that I know, I've no
choice but to call the police!

1:09:31.565 --> 1:09:33.991
No please, sis!

1:09:34.610 --> 1:09:36.886
As fellow members
of the needy, please don't.

1:09:36.987 --> 1:09:38.388
I'm not needy!

1:09:38.489 --> 1:09:42.267
But we're needy!

1:09:42.368 --> 1:09:46.855
We've no house, no money,
only debts!

1:09:46.956 --> 1:09:48.106
Sis, please!

1:09:48.207 --> 1:09:52.652
Even after 4 years of hiding,
those debt collectors won't give up.

1:09:52.753 --> 1:09:56.906
They're still searching for him,
threatening to stab him.

1:09:57.007 --> 1:09:58.808
You used loan sharks?

1:09:59.468 --> 1:10:01.686
It's all my fault.

1:10:02.221 --> 1:10:03.521
The Taiwan cake shop.

1:10:04.056 --> 1:10:07.834
My Taiwanese Wangshui
castella shop went bust.

1:10:07.935 --> 1:10:10.211
I was overwhelmed by debt.

1:10:10.312 --> 1:10:12.071
Please take this.

1:10:12.189 --> 1:10:13.573
What's that?

1:10:14.108 --> 1:10:17.969
It's not much,
just a modest sum.

1:10:18.070 --> 1:10:21.056
But we'll send it
to you every month.

1:10:21.157 --> 1:10:22.891
In return,
just once every 2 days.

1:10:22.992 --> 1:10:26.461
please leave him some food.

1:10:26.996 --> 1:10:30.006
No no, just once a week.

1:10:30.541 --> 1:10:32.734
There's a refrigerator here.
Just once a week.

1:10:32.835 --> 1:10:35.278
You've got some nerve!
I'm calling the police.

1:10:35.379 --> 1:10:36.596
Sis!

1:10:39.633 --> 1:10:40.850
Who is that?

1:10:43.888 --> 1:10:45.771
Wait... Jessica?

1:10:46.307 --> 1:10:47.332
Mr. Kim?

1:10:47.433 --> 1:10:48.533
What the hell?

1:10:50.019 --> 1:10:51.086
Dad, my ankle!

1:10:51.187 --> 1:10:52.378
You okay? Sorry.

1:10:52.479 --> 1:10:54.380
Dad, my foot.

1:10:54.481 --> 1:10:56.157
Don't call me Dad!

1:11:03.699 --> 1:11:07.502
I thought it was weird
when the driver was fired.

1:11:07.728 --> 1:11:08.728
Hey.

1:11:08.829 --> 1:11:11.272
- Let's talk things over.
- What the hell?

1:11:11.373 --> 1:11:12.732
Are you some
family of charlatans?

1:11:12.833 --> 1:11:13.650
So, sis...

1:11:13.751 --> 1:11:16.260
Don't fucking call me sis,
you filthy bitch!

1:11:16.795 --> 1:11:21.574
I'm gonna send this video
to the madame, how about that?

1:11:21.675 --> 1:11:23.868
Dad, my foot.

1:11:23.969 --> 1:11:26.187
No reception in
the basement, right?

1:11:26.722 --> 1:11:28.581
- The phone works fine.
- Fuck.

1:11:28.682 --> 1:11:33.294
Ma'am, to be honest,
the jobs we have here...

1:11:33.395 --> 1:11:36.422
Shut up!
It's too late now!

1:11:36.523 --> 1:11:39.759
Let's all go to jail!
We're fucking going down!

1:11:39.860 --> 1:11:43.371
Lady, are you crazy?

1:11:43.906 --> 1:11:48.893
If they see that video, Mr. Park
and his wife will be so shocked!

1:11:48.994 --> 1:11:52.380
What did those nice people
ever do wrong?

1:11:52.731 --> 1:11:53.731
Why do this to them?

1:11:53.832 --> 1:11:55.525
Stop right there!

1:11:55.626 --> 1:11:57.986
Or I'll push the 'send' button.

1:11:58.087 --> 1:12:00.054
Follow me.

1:12:00.589 --> 1:12:03.015
Calm down, ma'am.

1:12:06.553 --> 1:12:08.604
Don't push!

1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:11.148
Let's go up, honey.

1:12:11.684 --> 1:12:14.569
Time for you
to get some fresh air!

1:12:31.620 --> 1:12:37.925
Honey, this 'send' button
is like a missile launcher.

1:12:38.085 --> 1:12:39.844
What do you mean, honey?

1:12:40.421 --> 1:12:45.700
If we threaten to push it.
those people can't do anything.

1:12:45.801 --> 1:12:50.313
It's like a North Korean rocket.
A North Korean missile button!

1:12:51.849 --> 1:12:55.293
Today our beloved
Great Leader Kim Jong-un,

1:12:55.394 --> 1:12:58.463
after witnessing the
charlatan family video,

1:12:58.564 --> 1:13:01.299
was unable to contain
his shock and fury

1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:04.636
at their wicked,
despicable provocation!

1:13:04.737 --> 1:13:06.512
I've missed your jokes, honey!

1:13:06.613 --> 1:13:11.142
Therefore our Great Leader,
in this age of denuclearization,

1:13:11.243 --> 1:13:17.023
has commanded that the nation's
last remaining nuclear warhead

1:13:17.124 --> 1:13:19.609
be driven down the throats
of this wicked family!

1:13:19.710 --> 1:13:24.405
No one can imitate North Korean
news anchors like you!

1:13:24.506 --> 1:13:29.535
With their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard,

1:13:29.636 --> 1:13:34.540
our Dear Leaders wish to denuclearize
and bring world peace can...

1:13:34.641 --> 1:13:36.651
Hands in the air, fuckers!

1:13:37.186 --> 1:13:38.319
Higher!

1:13:40.230 --> 1:13:42.257
You scumbag family.

1:13:42.358 --> 1:13:43.432
Husband?

1:13:43.533 --> 1:13:44.342
Husband.

1:13:44.443 --> 1:13:45.226
Wife?

1:13:45.327 --> 1:13:46.177
Yes.

1:13:46.278 --> 1:13:47.278
Son?

1:13:47.379 --> 1:13:48.145
Yes.

1:13:48.246 --> 1:13:49.305
- Daughter?
- Daughter.

1:13:49.406 --> 1:13:51.349
You neanderthals.

1:13:51.450 --> 1:13:55.812
Is that all you can think to do,
drink yourselves stupid?

1:13:55.913 --> 1:14:01.192
In this home suffused with
Mr. Namgoong's creative spirit?

1:14:01.293 --> 1:14:02.318
You cretins!

1:14:02.419 --> 1:14:03.736
What do you know about art?

1:14:03.837 --> 1:14:06.097
What would they know?

1:14:06.757 --> 1:14:14.680
When the sun was nice,
we'd bask in those sunbeam, right?

1:14:15.516 --> 1:14:20.152
At such moments we could feel
his artistic touch.

1:15:08.026 --> 1:15:11.537
Give it to me!

1:15:30.591 --> 1:15:34.101
Good job! Delete it!

1:15:35.137 --> 1:15:37.730
Careful, don't send it
by accident.

1:15:52.279 --> 1:15:53.379
Hello?

1:15:53.906 --> 1:15:57.416
Listen, do you know how
to make ram-don?

1:15:57.951 --> 1:15:59.185
Ram-don?

1:15:59.286 --> 1:16:02.963
Da-song likes ram-don
more than anything.

1:16:03.123 --> 1:16:06.818
If you boil the water now,
the timing will be perfect.

1:16:06.919 --> 1:16:09.654
There's sirloin in the fridge,
add that too.

1:16:09.755 --> 1:16:11.280
Then, the camping...?

1:16:11.381 --> 1:16:15.100
My god, what a disaster.

1:16:15.636 --> 1:16:20.898
The river overflowed and
everyone was packing their tents,

1:16:21.016 --> 1:16:24.043
but Da-song was crying and
refusing to go home.

1:16:24.144 --> 1:16:28.280
Anyway, ram-don
as soon as we walk in, okay?

1:16:28.398 --> 1:16:30.883
Then you're almost here?

1:16:30.984 --> 1:16:33.536
8 minutes, according to the GPS.

1:16:33.929 --> 1:16:34.929
You arrive in 8 minutes...

1:16:35.030 --> 1:16:38.749
Start boiling
the water right away!

1:16:42.788 --> 1:16:44.505
What the hell is ram-don?

1:16:53.549 --> 1:16:55.349
Move, quickly!

1:16:57.135 --> 1:16:58.235
Hurry!

1:17:05.102 --> 1:17:07.069
Ramen/Udon.

1:17:08.605 --> 1:17:11.657
Dad, I can't drag her
any further!

1:17:22.703 --> 1:17:24.587
What are you doing?

1:17:25.706 --> 1:17:27.548
Dad!

1:17:30.586 --> 1:17:33.804
Go up quickly!
Help upstairs.

1:17:41.346 --> 1:17:42.446
Take this!

1:18:01.783 --> 1:18:02.975
Welcome home!

1:18:03.076 --> 1:18:06.420
Da-song, look!
Let's eat ram-don!

1:18:08.582 --> 1:18:10.090
Da-song!

1:18:12.711 --> 1:18:14.720
Da-song!

1:18:21.261 --> 1:18:22.645
Madame!

1:18:41.239 --> 1:18:43.099
Why don't you just
eat the ram-don?

1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:43.975
Shall I?

1:18:44.076 --> 1:18:47.144
No, wait.
I can give it to my husband.

1:18:47.245 --> 1:18:49.338
There's sirloin in here.

1:18:51.875 --> 1:18:55.636
It's cooked through?
Medium well done.

1:19:20.696 --> 1:19:26.601
Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!

1:19:26.702 --> 1:19:33.215
Home from the office,
Mr. Park is off duty now.

1:19:34.876 --> 1:19:39.155
Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!

1:19:39.256 --> 1:19:41.348
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

1:19:52.894 --> 1:19:55.296
Honey, do you want
some ram-don?

1:19:55.397 --> 1:19:56.422
Da-song doesn't want it?

1:19:56.523 --> 1:19:57.173
No.

1:19:57.274 --> 1:19:59.199
No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

1:19:59.735 --> 1:20:02.494
Why are you staring?

1:20:03.530 --> 1:20:07.016
Mr. Park, you feed me
and house me.

1:20:07.117 --> 1:20:08.625
Respect!

1:20:10.662 --> 1:20:12.337
You do this every day?

1:20:12.873 --> 1:20:18.343
Sure, I even send whole
sentences to thank him.

1:20:18.879 --> 1:20:20.988
Someone of your age
should know it.

1:20:21.089 --> 1:20:21.947
Know what?

1:20:22.048 --> 1:20:23.849
Morse Code.

1:20:24.426 --> 1:20:28.437
That sensor's going batty.

1:20:36.605 --> 1:20:40.132
Da-song will know it,
since he's a Scout.

1:20:40.233 --> 1:20:41.926
It's ridiculous, right?

1:20:42.027 --> 1:20:45.513
Running around.
trying to please a kid.

1:20:45.614 --> 1:20:47.598
He's not some kind of prince.

1:20:47.699 --> 1:20:50.459
He's the youngest.
It's common.

1:20:51.495 --> 1:20:53.003
Please understand.

1:20:53.538 --> 1:20:57.299
Da-song's a bit... unwell.

1:20:57.542 --> 1:21:00.594
He's receiving trauma therapy
and art therapy.

1:21:01.505 --> 1:21:03.531
There was an incident.

1:21:03.632 --> 1:21:05.015
What incident?

1:21:05.300 --> 1:21:09.228
Sis, you believe in ghosts, too?

1:21:10.347 --> 1:21:14.274
Da-song saw a ghost in the house
when he was in 1st grade.

1:21:20.816 --> 1:21:23.217
He had a birthday party
at home that day.

1:21:23.318 --> 1:21:25.761
Late that night,
when everyone was sleeping,

1:21:25.862 --> 1:21:30.433
Da-song crept down to the kitchen
and took the cake out.

1:21:30.534 --> 1:21:33.602
The whipped cream
on that cake was amazing.

1:21:33.703 --> 1:21:36.630
Even in bed, he couldn't
stop thinking about it.

1:21:37.165 --> 1:21:42.553
So Da-song was sitting,
eating his cake...

1:21:52.097 --> 1:21:55.065
He screamed,
and I ran downstairs,

1:21:55.600 --> 1:21:57.568
and he was all...

1:21:58.103 --> 1:22:03.448
his eyes rolled back in his head,
convulsions, foam in his mouth.

1:22:05.485 --> 1:22:07.720
Have you ever seen a child
have a seizure?

1:22:07.821 --> 1:22:08.554
No.

1:22:08.655 --> 1:22:13.934
They need 15-minute treatment,
or they're done for.

1:22:14.035 --> 1:22:19.214
That's the time you have to reach
an emergency room, 15 minutes.

1:22:20.750 --> 1:22:24.987
How can you live
in a place like this?

1:22:25.088 --> 1:22:28.282
Well, lots of people
live underground.

1:22:28.383 --> 1:22:30.284
Especially if you count
semi-basements.

1:22:30.385 --> 1:22:34.980
What'll you do?
You don't have a plan?

1:22:35.140 --> 1:22:38.775
I just feel comfortable here.

1:22:39.853 --> 1:22:43.071
It feels like I was born here.

1:22:43.732 --> 1:22:47.009
Maybe I had
my wedding here, too.

1:22:47.110 --> 1:22:50.537
As for the National Pension,
I don't qualify.

1:22:51.656 --> 1:22:55.292
In my old age,
love will comfort me.

1:22:56.828 --> 1:23:02.216
So please.
Let me live down here.

1:23:03.752 --> 1:23:05.469
Anyway...

1:23:06.004 --> 1:23:11.058
My husband was away on business,
so I had to deal with it all.

1:23:11.676 --> 1:23:15.996
Since then we've always
gone out for his birthday.

1:23:16.097 --> 1:23:19.124
Last year my mother's house,
this year, camping.

1:23:19.225 --> 1:23:24.088
Da-song's dad says it's
just a part of growing up.

1:23:24.189 --> 1:23:29.034
They say a ghost in the
house brings wealth.

1:23:30.195 --> 1:23:35.207
Actually, the money's
been good recently.

1:24:01.768 --> 1:24:03.819
Thank god.

1:24:30.380 --> 1:24:33.307
Just stay here for now.

1:24:43.893 --> 1:24:45.944
Zoonie, what's wrong?

1:24:47.981 --> 1:24:49.489
Something under there?

1:24:51.067 --> 1:24:52.826
What is it?

1:24:53.862 --> 1:24:55.078
Damn it!

1:24:56.614 --> 1:24:57.640
- Mom!
- Yeah?

1:24:57.741 --> 1:25:00.142
- How could you?
- What?

1:25:00.243 --> 1:25:04.363
I like ram-don too!
How could you not even ask me?

1:25:04.464 --> 1:25:05.189
Well...

1:25:05.290 --> 1:25:09.360
Da-song didn't want it, so you
asked Dad, then ate it yourself.

1:25:09.461 --> 1:25:10.277
Want her to make one?

1:25:10.378 --> 1:25:12.279
That's not the point!

1:25:12.380 --> 1:25:16.075
- Stop fighting over ramen!
- Why didn't you ask me?

1:25:16.176 --> 1:25:19.686
Oh, stop it! Just go to bed
Go get changed.

1:25:23.266 --> 1:25:24.858
This way!

1:25:27.353 --> 1:25:30.614
Under there! Hurry!

1:25:33.777 --> 1:25:36.095
One, two, three! One two three!

1:25:36.196 --> 1:25:37.638
Da-song?

1:25:37.739 --> 1:25:40.457
Da-song, cut it out!

1:25:40.992 --> 1:25:43.460
He's gone crazy!
Get an umbrella.

1:25:43.620 --> 1:25:45.128
Hey Park Da-song!

1:25:46.664 --> 1:25:51.443
What a monster.
What the hell is he doing?

1:25:51.544 --> 1:25:55.322
Da-song, itæŠ¯ time for bed!
You know how late it is?

1:25:55.423 --> 1:25:56.523
Here.

1:25:57.467 --> 1:25:58.767
Honey, here.

1:26:02.347 --> 1:26:09.027
Who do you take after to be
so stubborn! Look at this rain!

1:26:14.567 --> 1:26:17.411
OMG Kevin.
Da-song camping in the yard.

1:26:20.990 --> 1:26:25.419
Hey, channel 3 for emergencies!
Keep it turned on.

1:26:25.995 --> 1:26:29.189
Let me have it.
I can't believe him.

1:26:29.290 --> 1:26:31.925
Just leave him.
He'll come in if he's tired.

1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:35.120
- I want you here, honey.
- I'm with you.

1:26:35.221 --> 1:26:36.196
Hey, Da-hye!

1:26:36.297 --> 1:26:38.890
Stop using your phone.
Go to bed.

1:26:39.425 --> 1:26:41.869
Go sleep in your room.
We'll take care of things.

1:26:41.970 --> 1:26:44.997
This is the living room,
do you copy?

1:26:45.098 --> 1:26:46.206
Copy, over.

1:26:46.307 --> 1:26:50.502
Daddy is standing by
for emergencies, over.

1:26:50.603 --> 1:26:53.363
Got it, over.

1:26:54.399 --> 1:26:56.341
Is that tent going to leak?

1:26:56.442 --> 1:26:59.762
We ordered from the U.S.,
it'll be fine.

1:26:59.863 --> 1:27:02.890
- Should we sleep here?
- What?

1:27:02.991 --> 1:27:05.184
We've got a full view of the tent.

1:27:05.285 --> 1:27:07.144
Good idea.
I'll feel much better.

1:27:07.245 --> 1:27:07.978
Right?

1:27:08.079 --> 1:27:10.088
LetæŠ¯ watch over him as we sleep.

1:27:12.125 --> 1:27:13.550
What a kid...

1:27:23.094 --> 1:27:24.311
Wait a minute.

1:27:26.890 --> 1:27:28.874
Where's that smell coming from?

1:27:28.975 --> 1:27:30.400
What smell?

1:27:30.935 --> 1:27:32.277
Mr. Kim's smell.

1:27:32.812 --> 1:27:34.196
- Mr. Kim?
- Yeah.

1:27:34.814 --> 1:27:36.173
Not sure what you mean.

1:27:36.274 --> 1:27:39.451
Really?
You must have smelled it.

1:27:39.986 --> 1:27:43.555
That smell that wafts through
the car, how to describe it?

1:27:43.656 --> 1:27:46.016
- An old man's smell?
- No no, it's not that.

1:27:46.117 --> 1:27:48.376
What is it?

1:27:48.912 --> 1:27:50.795
Like an old radish?

1:27:51.414 --> 1:27:52.631
No.

1:27:52.749 --> 1:27:54.983
You know when you boil a rag?

1:27:55.084 --> 1:27:56.468
It smells like that.

1:27:59.005 --> 1:28:05.369
Anyway, even though he always
seems about to cross the line,

1:28:05.470 --> 1:28:08.705
he never does cross it.
That's good.

1:28:08.806 --> 1:28:10.440
- I'll give him credit.
- Yeah.

1:28:11.559 --> 1:28:14.319
But that smell crosses the line.

1:28:14.854 --> 1:28:17.072
It powers through
right into the back seat.

1:28:17.190 --> 1:28:18.966
How bad can it be?

1:28:19.067 --> 1:28:20.283
I don't know.

1:28:21.319 --> 1:28:23.703
It's hard to describe.

1:28:24.739 --> 1:28:28.183
But you sometimes smell it
on the subway.

1:28:28.284 --> 1:28:31.711
It's been ages
since I rode a subway.

1:28:32.247 --> 1:28:35.190
People who ride the subway
have a special smell.

1:28:35.291 --> 1:28:36.716
Yeah.

1:28:52.850 --> 1:28:55.902
Isn't this like
the cars back seat?

1:28:56.562 --> 1:29:00.031
What if Da-song comes back in?

1:29:00.566 --> 1:29:02.200
Don't worry!

1:29:02.735 --> 1:29:05.412
I can just pull my hand back.

1:29:10.952 --> 1:29:12.586
We shouldn't...

1:29:19.127 --> 1:29:20.510
Do it clockwise.

1:29:21.045 --> 1:29:22.145
Right.

1:29:25.508 --> 1:29:28.810
You know where.

1:29:45.361 --> 1:29:48.872
You still have those cheap panties?

1:29:49.052 --> 1:29:50.152
Huh?

1:29:50.408 --> 1:29:53.168
The ones Yoon's girlfriend
left behind.

1:29:54.287 --> 1:29:57.380
If you wear those,
I'll get really fucking hard.

1:29:57.915 --> 1:29:59.257
Really?

1:29:59.792 --> 1:30:02.802
Then buy me drugs.

1:30:03.379 --> 1:30:06.973
Buy me drugs!

1:30:08.051 --> 1:30:09.517
Eat this instead.

1:30:21.564 --> 1:30:22.697
You like it?

1:30:43.836 --> 1:30:46.221
They're passed out cold.
Sneak out now.

1:31:20.289 --> 1:31:22.716
Emergency!
Emergency, over!

1:31:25.253 --> 1:31:26.636
- Emergency!
- What?

1:31:27.655 --> 1:31:28.655
What is it, over!

1:31:28.756 --> 1:31:30.324
Da-song, what's wrong?

1:31:30.425 --> 1:31:32.892
I can't sleep, over.

1:31:33.010 --> 1:31:36.913
So stop it and come in, okay?

1:31:37.014 --> 1:31:39.666
Go sleep in your soft bed. over.

1:31:39.767 --> 1:31:41.084
Right!

1:31:41.185 --> 1:31:43.528
I don't want to. over.

1:31:44.063 --> 1:31:45.488
Hey, Park Da-song.

1:31:50.653 --> 1:31:52.996
Let's just sleep...

1:33:27.750 --> 1:33:31.511
How did it turn out back there?

1:33:32.547 --> 1:33:33.647
What?

1:33:35.967 --> 1:33:38.017
The people in the basement.

1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:45.108
Well, I tied them up.

1:33:45.560 --> 1:33:47.569
What will we do now?

1:33:48.688 --> 1:33:49.863
Huh?

1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:55.577
What do we do now,
what's our plan?

1:33:56.195 --> 1:33:59.289
I've been wondering...

1:34:00.032 --> 1:34:03.418
What would Min do
in this situation?

1:34:04.954 --> 1:34:07.297
Min wouldn't be
in this situation!

1:34:09.333 --> 1:34:15.013
Look kids, we made it
out of there safely, right?

1:34:16.090 --> 1:34:21.453
And besides us, nobody knows
what happened there. Right?

1:34:21.554 --> 1:34:24.480
So nothing happened.
You understand?

1:34:25.558 --> 1:34:30.153
I've got my own plan.

1:34:30.688 --> 1:34:34.407
So you two just
forget about it, okay?

1:34:34.942 --> 1:34:36.492
Let's go home.

1:34:37.528 --> 1:34:39.579
Let's go take a bath.

1:34:58.215 --> 1:35:00.725
What are you doing there?
Hurry up!

1:35:14.273 --> 1:35:16.532
What's going on?

1:35:18.653 --> 1:35:21.388
You stay there.
This is all sewage water.

1:35:21.489 --> 1:35:23.915
Was our window open?

1:35:28.454 --> 1:35:31.381
Help me out, Ki-taek!

1:35:39.590 --> 1:35:41.015
Ki-woo!

1:35:43.552 --> 1:35:46.521
Hey Ki-woo,
close the window!

1:35:47.556 --> 1:35:49.732
You got shocked?

1:35:56.357 --> 1:35:58.074
I'm dizzy.

1:36:01.654 --> 1:36:05.707
Hold on a sec.
Wait.

1:36:11.247 --> 1:36:13.047
Shit, I'm dizzy.

1:36:17.086 --> 1:36:19.637
Ki-jung, be careful.

1:36:21.173 --> 1:36:22.724
Don't touch anything.

1:36:35.271 --> 1:36:40.925
Honey, I've got a concussion.

1:36:41.026 --> 1:36:43.870
I can't see you.

1:37:04.967 --> 1:37:09.729
Honey, that woman Chung-sook...

1:37:10.264 --> 1:37:12.165
Oh, god.

1:37:12.266 --> 1:37:14.609
What a nice person.

1:37:16.187 --> 1:37:19.614
She kicked me down the stairs.

1:37:22.151 --> 1:37:24.202
Repeat after me.

1:37:24.737 --> 1:37:27.455
Chung-sook...

1:37:28.991 --> 1:37:32.418
Chung-sook...

1:37:41.337 --> 1:37:43.638
Hey, Ki-woo!

1:37:44.423 --> 1:37:46.032
What at are you doing there?

1:37:46.133 --> 1:37:47.233
Huh?

1:38:02.233 --> 1:38:06.369
H O L P... M...

1:39:11.677 --> 1:39:12.894
Dad.

1:39:13.554 --> 1:39:14.854
Yeah?

1:39:15.890 --> 1:39:19.609
What was your plan?

1:39:21.186 --> 1:39:23.196
What are you talking about?

1:39:24.231 --> 1:39:26.949
Before, you said you had a plan.

1:39:27.484 --> 1:39:29.452
What will you do?
About...

1:39:30.029 --> 1:39:31.287
the basement.

1:39:32.323 --> 1:39:38.044
Ki-woo, you know what kind
of plan never fails?

1:39:39.622 --> 1:39:42.148
No plan at all.

1:39:42.249 --> 1:39:43.925
No plan.

1:39:44.460 --> 1:39:46.010
You know why?

1:39:48.047 --> 1:39:54.727
If you make a plan,
life never works out that way.

1:39:55.262 --> 1:39:56.771
Look around us.

1:39:57.306 --> 1:40:02.944
Did these people think,
"Let's all spend the night in a gym?"

1:40:03.479 --> 1:40:05.446
But look now.

1:40:05.606 --> 1:40:09.617
Everyone's sleeping
on the floor, us included.

1:40:11.153 --> 1:40:14.580
That's why people
shouldn't make plans.

1:40:16.617 --> 1:40:20.395
With no plan,
nothing can go wrong.

1:40:20.496 --> 1:40:27.385
And if something spins out
of control, it doesn't matter.

1:40:28.420 --> 1:40:31.389
Whether you kill someone
or betray your country.

1:40:32.925 --> 1:40:36.560
None of it fucking matters.
Got it?

1:40:38.222 --> 1:40:39.689
Dad.

1:40:41.725 --> 1:40:43.317
I'm sorry.

1:40:43.936 --> 1:40:45.778
For what?

1:40:48.816 --> 1:40:50.449
Everything.

1:40:51.110 --> 1:40:52.910
All of it.

1:40:54.947 --> 1:40:57.248
I'll take care of everything.

1:40:57.783 --> 1:41:00.001
What are you talking about?

1:41:02.037 --> 1:41:04.630
Why are you hugging that stone?

1:41:05.249 --> 1:41:06.966
This?

1:41:12.506 --> 1:41:15.641
It keeps clinging to me.

1:41:17.678 --> 1:41:22.064
I think you need some sleep.

1:41:25.102 --> 1:41:26.694
I'm serious.

1:41:28.230 --> 1:41:30.823
It keeps following me.

1:41:43.871 --> 1:41:45.730
Miss Jessica!
Sorry to call on Sunday morning.

1:41:45.831 --> 1:41:48.191
Are you free for lunch today?

1:41:48.292 --> 1:41:52.053
We're having a birthday
impromptu for Da-song.

1:41:53.630 --> 1:41:55.365
A birthday party?

1:41:55.466 --> 1:41:58.893
If you come too,
Da-song will be so happy.

1:41:59.094 --> 1:42:03.230
And have as much pasta, gratin,
and salmon steak as you want.

1:42:03.348 --> 1:42:05.458
Please come by 1PM,

1:42:05.559 --> 1:42:08.670
and I'll count today as
one of your lessons.

1:42:08.771 --> 1:42:11.322
You know what I mean?
See you soon!

1:42:12.566 --> 1:42:14.008
- Mom.
- Yeah?

1:42:14.109 --> 1:42:17.762
For the impromptu,
should we invite Kevin too?

1:42:17.863 --> 1:42:20.640
Great idea! Why not?
Will you call him?

1:42:20.741 --> 1:42:24.644
Get some more sleep, honey!
You must be tired after yesterday.

1:42:24.745 --> 1:42:28.898
If we have a party,
won't you need to do the rounds?

1:42:28.999 --> 1:42:33.386
Right, the wine shop,
supermarket, bakery, florist...

1:42:34.213 --> 1:42:36.847
But I already told Mr. Kim
to hurry over.

1:42:36.965 --> 1:42:38.658
I'll pay him overtime.

1:42:38.759 --> 1:42:39.859
Perfect.

1:42:50.395 --> 1:42:54.073
Everyone it down, I'll explain!

1:42:54.316 --> 1:42:59.995
Da-hye: We're having a party,
and mom said to invite you!

1:43:01.949 --> 1:43:05.268
Sis, in the basement...

1:43:05.369 --> 1:43:07.645
we have 10 outdoor tables.

1:43:07.746 --> 1:43:11.632
First take them all out,
then arrange them...

1:43:12.292 --> 1:43:15.511
No, come to the window.
I need to show you.

1:43:17.214 --> 1:43:18.990
With Da-song's tent in the middle,

1:43:19.091 --> 1:43:22.626
curve the tables outward...

1:43:22.727 --> 1:43:24.871
A crane's wing formation!

1:43:24.972 --> 1:43:28.257
Like Admiral Yi used, you know?
The Battle of Hansan Island!

1:43:28.358 --> 1:43:30.918
Think of the tent as
the Japanese warship.

1:43:31.019 --> 1:43:36.299
And our tables will make a
semicircular crane's wing formation.

1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:40.595
Then near the tent will be the
barbeque grill, firewood and such.

1:43:40.696 --> 1:43:42.897
Arrange them all there!

1:43:42.998 --> 1:43:46.859
Oh sure, bring your husband too!

1:43:46.960 --> 1:43:47.685
Yeah!

1:43:47.786 --> 1:43:51.755
And definitely no presents,
just come!

1:43:52.624 --> 1:43:54.317
What dress code?

1:43:54.418 --> 1:43:58.053
It's an impromptu.
You can wear sweat pants!

1:43:59.089 --> 1:44:04.852
And definitely no presents!
Just come and eat hors d'oeuvres!

1:44:05.888 --> 1:44:07.997
You know my culinary skills!

1:44:08.098 --> 1:44:13.235
Right!
We'll get drunk in the daytime.

1:44:14.813 --> 1:44:18.324
If you'd sing, that'd be grand!
You know the one...

1:44:34.374 --> 1:44:37.176
Quiet, he's sleeping!

1:44:37.711 --> 1:44:40.780
Today the sky's so blue,
and no pollution!

1:44:40.881 --> 1:44:43.057
Thanks to all the rain yesterday.

1:44:44.092 --> 1:44:45.326
Right.

1:44:45.427 --> 1:44:49.522
So we traded camping
for a garden party.

1:44:50.557 --> 1:44:52.358
Lemons into lemonade.

1:44:55.479 --> 1:45:00.533
Right, that rain
was such a blessing!

1:45:02.069 --> 1:45:06.580
And definitely no presents,
I mean it!

1:45:07.115 --> 1:45:11.001
Right, just squeeze your
Mini Cooper into the garage.

1:45:11.270 --> 1:45:12.270
Go on up!

1:45:12.371 --> 1:45:17.283
Right, back it in.
Just don't block the Benz!

1:45:17.384 --> 1:45:20.484
You're here!
It's been so long!

1:45:23.507 --> 1:45:25.849
I told you no presents!

1:45:43.902 --> 1:45:46.036
You were thinking of
something else.

1:45:46.196 --> 1:45:47.580
What?

1:45:48.615 --> 1:45:51.792
While kissing me,
you thought of something else.

1:45:53.912 --> 1:45:55.170
No.

1:45:56.206 --> 1:45:59.842
What do you mean?
You're doing it now, too.

1:46:02.379 --> 1:46:03.637
Wow.

1:46:05.257 --> 1:46:07.975
Everyone looks gorgeous, right?

1:46:09.386 --> 1:46:13.147
Even for a sudden gathering,
they're so cool.

1:46:14.016 --> 1:46:16.400
And look so natural.

1:46:18.437 --> 1:46:19.695
Da-hye.

1:46:22.274 --> 1:46:23.907
Do I fit in here?

1:46:25.285 --> 1:46:27.011
What?

1:46:27.946 --> 1:46:30.956
In this setting, do I fit in?

1:46:40.876 --> 1:46:43.093
Hey, where are you going?

1:46:43.628 --> 1:46:44.845
I need to go down.

1:46:45.380 --> 1:46:47.389
Just stay with me.

1:46:48.383 --> 1:46:50.309
I need to go down there.

1:46:50.719 --> 1:46:55.731
Why go to those boring people?
Can't you stay here?

1:46:56.725 --> 1:47:01.003
Not to those people, down lover.

1:47:01.104 --> 1:47:04.031
Wow, what is that?

1:47:07.069 --> 1:47:10.954
God, I can't believe
I'm doing this at my age.

1:47:11.490 --> 1:47:13.457
It's so embarrassing.

1:47:14.493 --> 1:47:15.935
I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim.

1:47:16.036 --> 1:47:19.230
Da-song's mom insisted,
it canæŠ° be helped.

1:47:19.331 --> 1:47:20.898
But the concept is simple.

1:47:20.999 --> 1:47:26.320
There'll be a parade with
Jessica carrying a birthday cake.

1:47:26.421 --> 1:47:30.408
Then we jump out
and attack Jessica.

1:47:30.509 --> 1:47:32.743
Swinging our tomahawks!

1:47:32.844 --> 1:47:33.619
Right.

1:47:33.720 --> 1:47:39.149
Just then, Da-song the good Indian
will jump out and we'll do battle.

1:47:39.309 --> 1:47:43.879
Finally, he'll save Jessica,
the cake princess, and they'll all cheer.

1:47:43.980 --> 1:47:45.572
Something like that.

1:47:46.717 --> 1:47:47.717
Silly, isn't it?

1:47:47.818 --> 1:47:52.638
I guess your wife likes
events and surprises.

1:47:52.739 --> 1:47:54.832
Yeah, she does.

1:47:54.991 --> 1:47:57.960
But she's particularly into this party.

1:47:59.496 --> 1:48:02.464
You're trying your best, too.

1:48:03.500 --> 1:48:06.468
Well, you love her, after all.

1:48:12.008 --> 1:48:13.108
Mr. Kim.

1:48:14.761 --> 1:48:17.396
You're getting paid extra.

1:48:22.561 --> 1:48:26.905
Think of this as
part of your work, okay?

1:48:38.201 --> 1:48:39.852
Did you go down below?

1:48:39.953 --> 1:48:43.689
- Not yet.
- Shouldn't we talk to them?

1:48:43.790 --> 1:48:45.608
Reach an understanding?

1:48:45.709 --> 1:48:46.650
Exactly!

1:48:46.751 --> 1:48:49.528
We all got too fucking
worked up last night.

1:48:49.629 --> 1:48:53.557
Dad was going on
about some plan...

1:48:53.967 --> 1:48:56.410
- I'm just going down there.
- Hold on.

1:48:56.511 --> 1:48:58.704
Take this down to them.

1:48:58.805 --> 1:49:00.414
- They must be hungry.
- Right.

1:49:00.515 --> 1:49:02.483
Let them eat first.

1:49:04.394 --> 1:49:06.028
Coffee next time for Sure!

1:49:07.063 --> 1:49:08.798
Here you are, Jessica.

1:49:08.899 --> 1:49:11.258
- This is so amazing.
- Isn't it great?

1:49:11.359 --> 1:49:13.844
I've got a special favor to ask.

1:49:13.945 --> 1:49:15.120
What is it?

1:49:15.363 --> 1:49:17.431
This is... how to describe it?

1:49:17.532 --> 1:49:19.475
Da-song's trauma recovery cake?

1:49:19.576 --> 1:49:23.045
So it needs to be you who does it.
Today's highlight!

1:50:45.996 --> 1:50:49.381
Hey, are you okay?

1:50:54.421 --> 1:50:55.929
Are you...?

1:51:05.974 --> 1:51:07.274
Wait, mister!

1:52:54.290 --> 1:52:57.300
Kevin? Kevin!

1:53:03.842 --> 1:53:06.577
Da-song, happy birthday!

1:53:06.678 --> 1:53:08.145
Congratulations!

1:53:15.398 --> 1:53:16.824
Shit...

1:53:26.499 --> 1:53:28.599
Stop!

1:53:28.700 --> 1:53:30.809
Chung-sook!

1:53:30.910 --> 1:53:31.685
Ki-jung!

1:53:31.786 --> 1:53:33.395
Come out here, Chung-sook!

1:53:33.496 --> 1:53:36.906
Stop the blood!
Push down on the wound!

1:53:41.368 --> 1:53:42.803
Da-song!

1:53:43.459 --> 1:53:44.678
Honey!

1:53:45.860 --> 1:53:47.585
Let go, don't!

1:53:58.936 --> 1:54:00.699
It hurts.

1:54:05.197 --> 1:54:06.387
The emergency room!

1:54:06.488 --> 1:54:08.021
Get the car!

1:54:08.122 --> 1:54:09.665
Mr. Kim!
What are you doing?

1:54:09.766 --> 1:54:11.892
We can't wait for an ambulance!

1:54:11.993 --> 1:54:14.403
Stop pushing, Dad!

1:54:14.504 --> 1:54:17.464
Makes it hurt more.

1:54:18.124 --> 1:54:19.274
Car keys!
The car keys!

1:54:19.375 --> 1:54:22.192
Throw them!
Throw me the key!

1:54:39.812 --> 1:54:41.388
Are you okay?

1:54:41.489 --> 1:54:43.490
Don't touch it!

1:54:45.561 --> 1:54:48.078
Hello, Mr. Park.

1:54:48.196 --> 1:54:49.263
You know me?

1:54:49.364 --> 1:54:51.039
Respect!

1:56:17.702 --> 1:56:21.063
<i>Opening my eyes for
the first time in a month,</i>

1:56:21.164 --> 1:56:22.964
<i>I saw a detective.</i>

1:56:23.124 --> 1:56:27.903
You have the right
to an attorney...

1:56:28.004 --> 1:56:30.305
<i>Who looked nothing
like a detective.</i>

1:56:34.844 --> 1:56:36.537
Is he laughing?

1:56:36.638 --> 1:56:38.313
Just a sec.

1:56:38.723 --> 1:56:43.568
<i>Then the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke.</i>

1:56:44.604 --> 1:56:48.382
That happens sometimes
after brain surgery.

1:56:48.483 --> 1:56:50.700
They keep laughing.
For no reason.

1:56:51.361 --> 1:56:53.578
Do you hear me?

1:56:53.821 --> 1:56:55.705
Can you hear me?

1:56:55.823 --> 1:56:57.599
Then do I have to do it again?

1:56:57.700 --> 1:56:58.517
Do what?

1:56:58.618 --> 1:57:00.168
The Miranda thing.

1:57:02.705 --> 1:57:06.525
You have the right to remain silent.

1:57:06.626 --> 1:57:09.361
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

1:57:09.462 --> 1:57:11.846
He keeps laughing, look!

1:57:14.884 --> 1:57:20.981
<i>Even when I heard how much
Ki-jung bled that day...</i>

1:57:23.142 --> 1:57:30.357
<i>Even when I heard the words forgery,
trespassing, foul play, self-defense</i>

1:57:30.608 --> 1:57:34.995
<i>and we were lucky to
get away with a probation...</i>

1:57:38.032 --> 1:57:41.059
<i>Even when I finally
got to see Ki-jung's face...</i>

1:57:41.160 --> 1:57:44.170
Kim Ki-jung. RIP.

1:57:45.707 --> 1:57:48.008
<i>I kept laughing.</i>

1:57:57.677 --> 1:58:03.165
<i>Still, when I went back and
watched the news reports,</i>

1:58:03.266 --> 1:58:04.458
<i>I didn't laugh.</i>

1:58:04.559 --> 1:58:08.629
This sudden rampage in the
back yard of an upper-class home

1:58:08.730 --> 1:58:10.339
is a highly unusual case.

1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:14.843
Since the homeless man who sparked
the rampage died at the scene,

1:58:14.944 --> 1:58:20.307
police are struggling to even
establish a clear motive.

1:58:20.408 --> 1:58:24.895
The driver Kim and the slain Mr. Park
are said to have been on good terms.

1:58:24.996 --> 1:58:30.508
For now the police investigation is
focused on locating the driver Kim.

1:58:31.043 --> 1:58:34.780
Kim, after exiting this door
and descending the stairs,

1:58:34.881 --> 1:58:38.391
disappeared into the
neighboring alleys.

1:58:38.926 --> 1:58:44.064
Police searched the CCTVs
of nearby homes to no avail,

1:58:44.599 --> 1:58:47.734
and they have yet
to find any witnesses.

1:58:48.269 --> 1:58:50.337
Given the situation,

1:58:50.438 --> 1:58:55.700
it's not an exaggeration to say
that Kim vanished into thin air.

1:58:56.819 --> 1:59:03.784
<i>Actually Mom and I had
no idea where Dad was.</i>

1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:11.800
<i>But those detectives still
wore themselves out tailing us.</i>

1:59:15.838 --> 1:59:21.810
<i>Eventually the news went quiet,
and after the tails stopped,</i>

1:59:22.345 --> 1:59:25.772
<i>I started going up that mountain.</i>

1:59:27.809 --> 1:59:32.529
<i>From up there, you get
a great view of the house.</i>

1:59:35.274 --> 1:59:42.405
<i>That day, despite the cold.
I felt like staying longer.</i>

1:59:55.753 --> 1:59:59.264
Dash-dash-dot-dot.

2:00:24.323 --> 2:00:25.707
Son!

2:00:27.743 --> 2:00:29.085
Son!

2:00:31.122 --> 2:00:34.966
<i>Perhaps you, if no one else.
will be able to read this letter.</i>

2:00:38.504 --> 2:00:44.809
<i>You were a Boy Scout,
so I'm writing this just in case.</i>

2:00:47.847 --> 2:00:50.815
<i>Have your injuries healed?</i>

2:00:51.851 --> 2:00:56.154
<i>I'm sure your mom
is plenty healthy.</i>

2:01:00.192 --> 2:01:02.994
<i>I'm doing fine in here.</i>

2:01:04.030 --> 2:01:06.789
<i>Though thinking
of Ki-jung makes me cry.</i>

2:01:09.827 --> 2:01:14.672
<i>Even now, what happened
that day doesn't seem real.</i>

2:01:15.917 --> 2:01:17.634
<i>It feels like a dream,</i>

2:01:19.170 --> 2:01:21.137
<i>and yet it doesn't.</i>

2:01:22.173 --> 2:01:27.143
<i>That day as I went out the gate,
I suddenly knew.</i>

2:01:28.179 --> 2:01:29.938
<i>Where I needed to go...</i>

2:02:09.345 --> 2:02:12.330
<i>A house where such
grisly crime took place</i>

2:02:12.431 --> 2:02:15.692
<i>would surely not
be easy to sell.</i>

2:02:18.813 --> 2:02:21.214
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

2:02:21.315 --> 2:02:27.870
<i>I struggled to hold out
like that in an empty house.</i>

2:02:30.408 --> 2:02:33.310
<i>Still, thanks to
the house being empty.</i>

2:02:33.411 --> 2:02:38.273
<i>what was her name?
Moon-gwang?</i>

2:02:38.374 --> 2:02:42.677
<i>I was able to give her
a proper send off.</i>

2:02:43.796 --> 2:02:50.560
<i>I hear tree-side burials are trendy.
so hell, I did my best.</i>

2:02:54.098 --> 2:02:57.734
<i>But those real estate sharks
sure are clever.</i>

2:03:02.273 --> 2:03:06.509
<i>They hoodwinked some people
who had just arrived in Korea</i>

2:03:06.610 --> 2:03:08.953
<i>and managed to sell the house.</i>

2:03:10.072 --> 2:03:13.350
<i>With the parents working,
and the kids attending school,</i>

2:03:13.451 --> 2:03:16.044
<i>the family is usually out.</i>

2:03:16.162 --> 2:03:21.591
<i>But the goddamned housekeeper
stays there 24 hours a day.</i>

2:03:21.751 --> 2:03:26.679
<i>Each time I go upstairs,
I take my life in my hands.</i>

2:03:29.216 --> 2:03:33.561
<i>It turns out Germans eat more
than just sausage and beer.</i>

2:03:34.096 --> 2:03:36.147
<i>What a relief.</i>

2:03:38.726 --> 2:03:43.112
<i>Passing the time down here,
everything starts to go hazy.</i>

2:03:47.651 --> 2:03:51.829
<i>Today at least
I was able to write you a letter.</i>

2:03:53.365 --> 2:03:57.268
<i>If I send out the letter
this way every night,</i>

2:03:57.369 --> 2:04:01.839
<i>maybe someday you'll see it.</i>

2:04:07.880 --> 2:04:09.931
<i>So long.</i>

2:04:23.479 --> 2:04:24.546
You're home, Ki-woo?

2:04:24.647 --> 2:04:25.747
Yeah.

2:04:40.162 --> 2:04:45.174
<i>Dad, today I made a plan.</i>

2:04:46.710 --> 2:04:48.636
<i>A fundamental plan.</i>

2:04:51.674 --> 2:04:53.349
<i>I'm going to earn money.</i>

2:04:53.926 --> 2:04:55.726
<i>A lot of it.</i>

2:04:59.265 --> 2:05:03.776
<i>University, a career, marriage.
those are all fine,</i>

2:05:03.936 --> 2:05:05.962
<i>but first I'll earn money.</i>

2:05:06.063 --> 2:05:11.409
You'll see once you go in,
but it's very spacious.

2:05:11.944 --> 2:05:16.681
Actually, we don't show
this house to just anyone.

2:05:16.782 --> 2:05:21.294
<i>When I have money,
I'll buy that house.</i>

2:05:22.329 --> 2:05:26.591
<i>On the day we move in,
Mom and I will be in the yard.</i>

2:05:27.126 --> 2:05:29.552
<i>Because the sunshine
is so nice there.</i>

2:05:30.713 --> 2:05:32.763
<i>All you'll need to do</i>

2:05:32.923 --> 2:05:35.808
<i>is walk up the stairs.</i>

2:06:58.425 --> 2:07:02.562
<i>Take care until then.</i>

2:07:07.226 --> 2:07:09.360
<i>So long.</i>
