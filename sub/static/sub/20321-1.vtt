- Wow.
- Was that something or was that something?

01:11.951 --> 01:13.784
We'll be right back.

01:13.852 --> 01:16.787
I'm impressed. You're like
a rock star in your own right.

01:16.855 --> 01:18.789
Seriously, do not get him
started, please.

01:18.857 --> 01:20.492
No, get me started.
Definitely get me started.

01:20.559 --> 01:22.427
- Is that you, Oz?
- Hey, Chad, what's going on?

01:22.495 --> 01:24.795
What's going on? Great show,
guys. You guys were fantastic.

01:24.863 --> 01:27.732
Thanks. My arm's doing good?
Beautiful Sandy, how are you?

01:27.799 --> 01:28.801
A man with taste.

01:28.921 --> 01:30.715
- Hey, it's Toby.
- How's it going?

01:30.835 --> 01:32.802
- Tia.
- Tia. Nice to meet you, girl.

01:32.870 --> 01:35.272
- Nice to meet you.
- Buddy, I'm gonna grab a beer.

01:35.340 --> 01:37.741
Yeah. We'll totally hook up,
maybe have some beers, yeah.

01:37.808 --> 01:40.744
- All right guys, see ya.
- Don't stop believin'. Yup. Right?

01:40.811 --> 01:43.780
- That was my thrill for the evening.
- Wow. I feel dissed.

01:43.848 --> 01:47.550
But you're my everyday thrill. Ok, I
have to get going. I've got a deadline.

01:47.618 --> 01:49.552
Oh, you know what,
I will give you a drive.

01:49.620 --> 01:53.222
- Right.
- Ok. Well, you liked the band, right?

01:53.290 --> 01:57.126
You know me well enough to know
I mean what I say. Honesty is how I roll.

01:57.194 --> 02:00.795
Sometimes being too honest is
not a great thing.

02:00.863 --> 02:03.632
Spoken like a man desperately
clinging on to his commitment issues.

02:03.699 --> 02:06.000
But don't worry. I'm playing
a long game.

02:06.068 --> 02:08.402
And therefore, you have
no chance of beating me.

02:08.471 --> 02:10.805
Yes. Hey, Tia.

02:10.872 --> 02:13.475
Hey, let's do this.
Toby, have a good night.

02:13.543 --> 02:14.976
Make sure Oz gets home.

02:15.044 --> 02:17.244
He lives in my kitchen.

02:19.447 --> 02:22.816
You know, I'll tell you something.
You got a good lady there.

02:22.884 --> 02:26.753
Yeah. She doesn't know
what she has, though.

02:36.430 --> 02:38.864
Hey. What are you guys
watching?

02:38.932 --> 02:42.302
It's footage taken from
a secure warehouse in Vancouver.

02:42.369 --> 02:45.605
All indications suggest that it's
tied to a string of robberies

02:45.673 --> 02:47.674
- in Toronto.
- Wow, these guys are good.

02:47.741 --> 02:50.576
They're walking through the security
systems like they don't even exist.

02:50.643 --> 02:54.346
Yeah, and walked away with experimental
capacitors, microprocessors...

02:54.414 --> 02:56.315
Most of the equipment
they've stolen has been

02:56.382 --> 02:59.284
military high tech, not for sale
outside of north America.

02:59.352 --> 03:01.486
Our theory is
they're moving it offshore.

03:01.554 --> 03:04.222
Cross-referencing this robbery
with the Toronto ones,

03:04.289 --> 03:06.257
I realized that these guys have
been working the west coast

03:06.325 --> 03:08.392
for quite a while. I think
they might even be based there.

03:08.460 --> 03:10.394
Which means they're working
nationwide.

03:10.462 --> 03:12.430
Michelle, Toby, I'm sending you
to Vancouver.

03:12.497 --> 03:14.098
Nice. Road trip.

03:14.165 --> 03:17.435
Well, I'd describe it more as
hunting a highly organized

03:17.502 --> 03:20.237
and highly dangerous gang of thieves,
but I suppose it's semantics.

03:20.304 --> 03:22.905
Pack your bags. You're
on the 11 o'clock flight.

03:22.973 --> 03:25.875
- Pick you up on the way to the airport.
- Mmm-hmm. You good?

03:25.943 --> 03:29.078
Yeah, yeah. No, you guys go
on a road trip. That's cool.

03:29.146 --> 03:31.514
Just leave me here,
slaving over a hot keyboard.

03:31.582 --> 03:33.516
Come on. I'm gonna bring you
back something, all right?

03:33.584 --> 03:36.452
Yeah. Don't tell me, though.
Salmon. Right?

Sergeant McCluskey,
Special Consultant Logan,

03:55.931 --> 03:58.098
it is so nice to meet you.
Constable Kathy Slocum.

03:58.218 --> 03:58.824
Hey.

03:58.944 --> 04:01.200
The rest of the office is
spread pretty thin, but I've

04:01.268 --> 04:03.536
been assigned to assist you on
the Vancouver end of your case.

04:03.604 --> 04:06.539
- Oh, cool.
- Sergeant, double shot cappuccino.

04:06.607 --> 04:09.542
- Special Consultant, drip, black. Right.
- You can just call me Toby.

04:09.610 --> 04:12.778
I've been following the successes of
your unit over the past couple of years.

04:12.845 --> 04:15.180
You've taken on all the cases
everyone else gave up on,

04:15.247 --> 04:17.182
and you busted
every single one of them.

04:17.249 --> 04:19.284
I look forward
to seeing action with you.

04:19.351 --> 04:21.553
I don't know how much action
we're gonna see,

04:21.620 --> 04:23.855
but maybe we should just get
right down to it.

04:23.923 --> 04:26.424
Ok, so the theft
that brought you here was

04:26.492 --> 04:28.893
at the secure perimeter
warehousing facility.

04:28.961 --> 04:31.596
The equipment stolen was
an advanced programmable

04:31.663 --> 04:35.332
vibration amplification system.
Cutting edge, and specialized

04:35.400 --> 04:37.668
in industrial and military
applications.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.904
It's on the federal listing
for restricted tech.

04:39.972 --> 04:42.607
Ok, well, we'll talk
to the supervisor ourselves.

04:42.674 --> 04:44.908
Way ahead of you.

04:44.976 --> 04:46.977
Supervisor's name, number,
and a map

04:47.044 --> 04:49.980
to the location. We can be there
in under an hour.

04:50.047 --> 04:51.881
Ok. I lived here before.
I know where that is.

04:51.949 --> 04:54.985
You should stay here and
interface with Corporal Clark.

04:55.052 --> 04:58.521
Oh. Sure.
But I warn you.

04:58.589 --> 05:01.757
I'll take every opportunity
to observe your methods.

05:01.825 --> 05:03.659
I really want to get
inside your heads.

05:03.727 --> 05:06.629
That's usually my line.
That's good.

05:06.696 --> 05:08.230
Um, thank you.

05:12.035 --> 05:14.837
We warehouse for the top names
in industry and technology.

05:14.904 --> 05:16.804
We can't afford
to make a mistake.

05:16.872 --> 05:18.740
There was no fault at our end.

05:18.807 --> 05:21.109
Well, this robbery proves
that that's not true.

05:21.176 --> 05:23.612
We've got five different
security systems

05:23.679 --> 05:25.947
they walked through
to get into that warehouse.

05:26.014 --> 05:28.283
They somehow got access
to keypad codes,

05:28.351 --> 05:31.886
magnetic access cards,
proximity readers.

05:31.954 --> 05:35.389
Who showed up
on the access log?

05:35.457 --> 05:37.924
The system said it was
our head of security,

05:37.992 --> 05:41.295
Avi Calder. He was on vacation
at the time of the robbery.

05:41.363 --> 05:43.830
- You've checked him out?
- He's worked here

05:43.898 --> 05:45.832
over 20 years.
He's above reproach.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.769
- We're still gonna have to clear him.
- We're gonna need a list

05:48.836 --> 05:50.771
of every employee that was hired
within the last six months.

05:50.838 --> 05:53.406
Also an itemized list
of every stolen good.

05:53.474 --> 05:56.309
I can get that in a day or two.

05:56.377 --> 05:58.644
<i>They don't know... can't</i>
<i>find out... other thefts...</i>

05:58.711 --> 06:01.213
<i>Microwave transformer...</i>
<i>Can't find out... fire me...</i>

06:01.281 --> 06:03.816
You're sure it was only
a relay system they stole?

06:03.884 --> 06:07.186
I'll do an inventory, but
that's all that was reported.

06:07.254 --> 06:09.488
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:09.555 --> 06:11.623
I have to get back to work.

06:15.995 --> 06:18.797
He's hiding something.
I heard him thinking

06:18.864 --> 06:21.933
about a microwave transformer.
It's not the first theft.

06:22.001 --> 06:24.969
I'll get Dev to look into it.

06:25.037 --> 06:26.938
You got the better
of the smartest criminal

06:27.006 --> 06:30.407
in the country.
Yeah, well, I guess people are

06:30.474 --> 06:33.343
sometimes too smart for their own good.
Hey, Toby, Michelle. Good timing.

06:33.411 --> 06:35.712
- What do you have for us?
- I ran the employee records

06:35.780 --> 06:38.816
for secure perimeter warehousing and
I think I may have found our mole.

06:38.883 --> 06:42.300
A night janitorial staff member
goes by the name Frank Dorian.

06:42.420 --> 06:45.888
<i>He was hired three weeks before the robbery
and hasn't been seen since the hit.</i>

06:45.956 --> 06:48.457
A facial recognition search
at the ministry of transport

06:48.525 --> 06:51.127
gave us his real name,
which is...

06:51.195 --> 06:54.864
Dan Goodwin. He did a good job
creating his fake identity, though.

06:54.932 --> 06:56.841
<i>The company's own security
would never have caught it.</i>

06:56.961 --> 06:58.182
He must have some skills.

06:58.302 --> 07:00.203
Yeah, he's a computer
programmer. He worked at a place

07:00.270 --> 07:02.270
called Excelcorp
for the last five years.

07:02.338 --> 07:05.073
It's a design firm.
He quit a few months ago.

07:05.141 --> 07:07.375
He also traveled to Toronto
three times this month,

07:07.443 --> 07:10.511
each visit corresponding with one
of the high tech thefts out there.

07:10.579 --> 07:12.948
All right, so Dan poses
as a night janitor

07:13.015 --> 07:15.150
and no one thinks twice
about him having access

07:15.218 --> 07:17.185
all night
to the company's computers.

07:17.253 --> 07:19.186
<i>- Exactly.</i>
- Any criminal history?

07:19.254 --> 07:21.288
He was arrested at a peace
rally about a year ago

07:21.356 --> 07:23.102
but that's a long walk from a theft of
this magnitude.

07:23.222 --> 07:24.039
Do we have an address?

07:24.159 --> 07:26.426
1212 Dunbar.
I already have somebody

07:26.494 --> 07:28.395
camped outside the apartment
in case he shows up.

07:28.463 --> 07:30.231
Ok, we'll head over there now.

07:30.298 --> 07:32.266
Meanwhile, Kathy and I will
look further into Mr. Goodwin.

07:35.269 --> 07:37.203
It's like we're partners.

07:37.271 --> 07:39.939
Totes. Partners.

07:44.711 --> 07:46.946
So, when was the last time
you saw him?

07:47.014 --> 07:49.249
Maybe a week.
What's he done, anyway?

07:49.316 --> 07:51.649
How well did you know him?

07:51.717 --> 07:53.685
Been here six months.
Pays his rent.

07:53.753 --> 07:55.687
Has people over
for some kinda meeting.

07:55.755 --> 07:58.857
- I kinda got a feeling about him.
- Hey, Michelle, check this out.

07:58.925 --> 08:01.260
Lots of literature here
from different activist groups...

08:01.327 --> 08:05.163
anti-war, culture jamming,
economic boycotts.

08:05.231 --> 08:07.464
Did he ever talk to you
about political agendas?

08:07.532 --> 08:09.800
Another tenant said
he went on peace marches,

08:09.868 --> 08:12.569
that kind of thing.
Bound to get into trouble.

08:12.637 --> 08:14.571
So, why does a guy go
from peace marches

08:14.639 --> 08:17.641
to stealing high-tech
electronics?

08:19.711 --> 08:22.545
(Michelle): - Hey.
- So, Dev,

08:22.613 --> 08:27.650
I heard the supervisor thinking about other
thefts and the term "microwave transformer".

08:27.718 --> 08:29.685
There was an American busted
last year trying to ship

08:29.753 --> 08:31.854
experimental microwave
transformers into North Korea.

08:31.923 --> 08:34.157
So, this could confirm
our suspicion they're exporting

08:34.225 --> 08:37.592
- sensitive tech.
- We need to find Dan Goodwin.

08:37.660 --> 08:39.395
Now.

08:47.370 --> 08:49.004
IIB.

08:49.072 --> 08:50.940
We need to speak to the manager
of one of your ex-employees,

08:51.007 --> 08:53.742
- Dan Goodwin.
- Sure.

08:53.810 --> 08:56.344
Someone here is gonna know
what Dan Goodwin was into.

08:56.412 --> 08:58.980
Yeah, or this was one of the
companies that they infiltrated.

08:59.048 --> 09:00.614
Yeah.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.654
Lori?

09:06.721 --> 09:08.489
Toby.

09:08.557 --> 09:10.658
- You two know each other.
- Yeah.

09:10.725 --> 09:13.561
Michelle, this is Lori Black. We
knew each other a long time ago.

09:13.628 --> 09:16.897
- They said it was the IIB.
- It is.

09:16.965 --> 09:19.667
This is Sergeant McCluskey,
and we're gonna ask you

09:19.734 --> 09:21.936
a few questions about
a former employee,

09:22.003 --> 09:23.971
- Dan Goodwin.
- Why?

09:24.038 --> 09:27.474
We believe he was involved
in a series of robberies.

09:27.541 --> 09:29.843
That's not Dan.
He's a good guy.

09:29.910 --> 09:31.811
Well, we have reason
to believe otherwise,

09:31.879 --> 09:33.813
so we're gonna need
to ask him some questions.

09:33.881 --> 09:35.815
He hasn't worked here
for a few months,

09:35.883 --> 09:37.817
and I don't know
what I can tell you.

09:37.885 --> 09:40.520
- What'd he do here?
- He was a programmer.

09:40.588 --> 09:42.889
Most of his work was
with electronic

09:42.957 --> 09:45.224
interface controls.
Excuse me, I'm just having

09:45.292 --> 09:50.363
a hard time processing this.
You being with the police.

09:50.430 --> 09:52.999
Yeah. Um, things change.

09:53.066 --> 09:57.904
Dan was helping people break
into secure locations.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.872
Do you know if he had any

09:59.939 --> 10:01.507
money problems?

10:01.574 --> 10:04.877
I know his family was having
troubles when he came here,

10:04.944 --> 10:07.846
but I heard he worked his way
through that.

10:07.914 --> 10:09.948
When we searched
his apartment, we found

10:10.016 --> 10:13.051
literature from various activist groups. Do
you know which ones he was involved with?

10:13.119 --> 10:15.820
Uh, I didn't know Dan

10:15.888 --> 10:18.255
very well.
When he left

10:18.323 --> 10:22.326
Excelcorp, he said it was because
he wanted to make a difference.

10:22.394 --> 10:25.406
- Some people have ideals.
- Any idea where he is now?

10:25.526 --> 10:26.445
No. I Haven't talked to him

10:26.565 --> 10:29.534
- since he left the company.
- So that's it? That's all you know?

10:29.601 --> 10:32.402
Well, I'm sure you'd tell me
if it wasn't.

10:32.469 --> 10:34.804
I'm afraid I can't help you.
So, if you'll excuse me,

10:34.872 --> 10:39.142
- I have to get back to work.
- Ok, Lori... you look good.

10:39.209 --> 10:42.846
It was good to see you. I'm
happy to know that you're ok.

10:50.720 --> 10:51.695
What the hell was that?

10:51.815 --> 10:53.870
We were together when I was younger.
It didn't end great.

10:53.990 --> 10:57.092
- Ah. Your fault?
- I was in a bad place, ok?

10:57.160 --> 10:59.094
I didn't know how
to control the gift,

10:59.162 --> 11:01.196
and peoples' thoughts were
always bombarding me.

11:01.264 --> 11:03.198
- Including hers?
- Yeah.

11:03.266 --> 11:06.801
And it was hard because she felt
like I was always spying on her.

11:06.869 --> 11:10.304
- So, she knew?
- Yeah. She was the first girlfriend I told.

11:10.372 --> 11:12.774
Wow. Was she telling the truth when she
said she didn't know where Dan was?

11:12.841 --> 11:15.142
- She seemed to be.
- What do you mean, "Seemed to be"?

11:15.210 --> 11:18.713
- I didn't read her.
- Ok, maybe you trust that girl,

11:18.781 --> 11:20.328
but from where I was standing,

11:20.448 --> 11:22.629
it looks like she still has
some pretty serious issues with you.

11:22.749 --> 11:23.951
I trust her, Michelle.

11:24.018 --> 11:25.518
(Elevator ding)

11:28.122 --> 11:30.791
<i>I've been working my way</i>

11:30.858 --> 11:33.594
through the literature you found
in Dan Goodwin's apartment.

11:33.661 --> 11:35.928
So far, nobody's admitted
a connection to him.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.630
<i>Yeah, but</i>

11:37.698 --> 11:40.466
I looked at his banking records
and he made regular monthly

11:40.533 --> 11:42.468
contributions to a group
called Action Direct.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.670
- Ties to illegal activities?
- Well, I...

11:44.738 --> 11:46.639
As far as we can tell,
they're just about raising

11:46.707 --> 11:48.652
the social consciousness
of the community.

11:48.772 --> 11:51.174
Let's see what they raised
in Dan Goodwin.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.359
Let's go.

11:57.683 --> 11:59.951
Hardly looks like a front
for illegal tech sales.

12:00.019 --> 12:03.354
Well, you should know more than
anybody that looks can be deceiving.

12:08.292 --> 12:11.394
- Hi. I'm Edgar. How can I help you?
- We're with the IIB.

12:11.462 --> 12:15.065
We want to ask you a few questions about
one of your members. Dan Goodwin.

12:15.133 --> 12:17.668
I'm afraid
I don't know the name.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.670
Really? Because he was
a regular contributor

12:19.738 --> 12:21.672
to your organization
for the last few years.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.673
We have
over a thousand contributors.

12:23.741 --> 12:26.009
I can't expect
to know all of them.

12:26.076 --> 12:27.751
Those people are dangerous.

12:27.871 --> 12:29.359
What are you talking about?
They're actually

12:29.479 --> 12:33.182
doing something! We're handing out
pamphlets. This isn't going to do anything!

12:33.250 --> 12:36.019
Well, we have reports that he
worked here in the office with you,

12:36.086 --> 12:37.836
and that you two didn't
get along.

12:37.956 --> 12:38.936
Who told you that?

12:39.056 --> 12:41.070
What's important is that
you tell us the truth.

12:41.190 --> 12:44.693
There's evidence that he's involved
in thefts of restricted electronics.

12:47.296 --> 12:50.498
He didn't feel as if what we were doing
here was making enough of a difference,

12:50.566 --> 12:52.937
and there were other people who
offered quick fixes.

12:52.920 --> 12:53.783
What people?

12:53.903 --> 12:56.871
He'd been approached by a group
called Economic Justice Awareness.

12:56.938 --> 13:00.274
Right. They're the ones that
burned down the police vehicles

13:00.341 --> 13:02.309
during the G20 riots
a few years ago.

13:02.377 --> 13:06.180
They've been suspected
in a number of other actions.

13:06.247 --> 13:09.349
I told Dan extreme actions
isn't the way to effect change.

13:09.417 --> 13:12.886
- So they approached him.
- Yeah, they work the shadows,

13:12.953 --> 13:16.856
meet people at peace marches, recruit
the ones who can forward their agenda.

13:16.924 --> 13:19.125
Do you know anyone else
from the organization?

13:19.193 --> 13:22.461
I know nothing more about them
and I don't want to know.

13:22.529 --> 13:23.963
Please excuse me.

13:24.031 --> 13:26.132
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.101
Dev, we might have a lead as to
who Goodwin was working with.

13:29.169 --> 13:31.034
I need you to find out whatever you can

13:31.154 --> 13:32.485
about a group called
Economic Justice Awareness.

13:32.605 --> 13:34.216
<i>Yeah, I've heard some
chatter about them.</i>

13:34.336 --> 13:35.855
<i>Rumours are they're
ramping up their actions.</i>

13:35.975 --> 13:38.711
Or they could be selling this stuff
to fund an extreme activist group.

13:38.778 --> 13:40.879
Yeah, or they're using
the tech for a specific purpose.

13:40.947 --> 13:42.881
I'm going to scrutinize the list
of the stolen items

13:42.949 --> 13:44.916
a little bit further and see
what they could add up to.

13:44.983 --> 13:46.918
<i>All right, well, get Kathy
to ask around Vancouver</i>

13:46.985 --> 13:48.886
<i>And see if there's
any specific targets.</i>

13:48.954 --> 13:51.522
Ok, so that means I have
to call her, right?

13:51.590 --> 13:53.758
Yeah. Do you have a problem
with that?

13:53.826 --> 13:57.428
No. No. No. It's just she's
really, um... enthusiastic.

13:57.495 --> 14:00.563
I remember when you used
to be enthusiastic.

14:00.631 --> 14:04.634
<i>Please. Oh, before you go, </i>

14:04.702 --> 14:06.770
I checked into Dan Goodwin's
phone records,

14:06.838 --> 14:08.772
and although he left Excelcorp
a couple of months ago,

14:08.840 --> 14:11.975
he's made 10 calls
to a supervisor there.

14:12.043 --> 14:14.911
<i>Her name is Lori Black.</i>

14:14.979 --> 14:19.414
We'll get back to you. So,
your old girlfriend lied to us.

14:19.482 --> 14:21.516
- I'll have Kathy bring her in.
- No, no. I'll talk to her.

14:21.584 --> 14:24.987
- Toby, she could be involved.
- I know what to do. Let me talk to her.

14:25.055 --> 14:28.490
The minute you get the feeling she's
playing us, then we bring her in.

14:30.995 --> 14:31.841
Hey.

14:32.696 --> 14:34.099
What are you doing
back here?

14:34.219 --> 14:37.132
You lied about being in
touch with Dan Goodwin.

14:37.199 --> 14:40.135
I should have known you'd just walk
into my head and take what you wanted.

14:40.202 --> 14:43.271
No, I didn't, Lori.
I wouldn't.

14:43.338 --> 14:47.441
We looked at Dan's phone records.
We know that he was calling you.

14:47.509 --> 14:49.443
We've got evidence
that Dan's involved

14:49.511 --> 14:51.646
- with dangerous activists.
- You're lying.

14:51.713 --> 14:53.814
He's not some kind
of terrorist.

14:53.882 --> 14:57.318
The people he's involved with
are. He's in way over his head.

14:57.386 --> 15:00.421
We need to find him
before he hurts someone

15:00.489 --> 15:02.690
or he gets himself hurt.

15:10.698 --> 15:13.833
His stepmom has a place
in Kitsilano.

15:13.901 --> 15:17.404
That's where he was staying
when he called me last.

15:17.471 --> 15:19.439
Promise me you're
not gonna hurt him.

15:19.507 --> 15:21.941
We're not gonna hurt him.
We just want to talk to him.

15:22.009 --> 15:24.811
He can help us.

15:24.878 --> 15:28.347
Do you... do you ever
think about us?

15:30.284 --> 15:31.784
Of course I do.

15:31.852 --> 15:34.787
How could you just walk away
like that?

15:34.855 --> 15:37.689
You packed up and left town.

15:37.756 --> 15:41.293
You didn't even tell me
you were going.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.329
Because I knew that you were
gonna ask me to stay.

15:44.396 --> 15:48.466
I wouldn't have the strength
to say no.

15:48.534 --> 15:50.568
- Was I so terrible?
- No.

15:50.636 --> 15:54.004
You know, suddenly I would find
myself in someone else's head,

15:54.072 --> 15:55.773
even yours,

15:55.841 --> 15:59.643
seeing things
I should never see.

15:59.711 --> 16:03.947
It was driving me crazy.

16:04.014 --> 16:06.049
I was young.

16:08.085 --> 16:10.053
If I didn't know how to deal
with it then,

16:10.120 --> 16:12.222
then how could I have expected
you to deal with it?

16:14.225 --> 16:16.525
Well...

16:16.593 --> 16:19.194
I would have liked
the chance to try.

16:19.262 --> 16:21.296
I'm sorry

16:21.365 --> 16:24.767
how it all worked out.

16:24.835 --> 16:26.736
I regret that I hurt you.

16:26.803 --> 16:30.072
You seeing somebody now?

16:32.040 --> 16:34.709
- Yeah.
- Does she know?

16:34.777 --> 16:36.378
No.

16:36.445 --> 16:39.514
(Dialing on cell phone)

16:39.582 --> 16:42.049
Thank you.

16:42.117 --> 16:44.218
Hey, Michelle. I'm following
a Dan Goodwin lead.

16:44.286 --> 16:45.953
Call me back.

17:17.983 --> 17:20.786
- What do you want?
- Hey, Dan, I'm a friend of Lori's.

17:20.853 --> 17:23.755
- She told me I'd find you here.
- She shouldn't have done that.

17:23.823 --> 17:25.857
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the property.

17:25.925 --> 17:28.660
Dan, I'm with the IIB.

17:28.728 --> 17:31.290
You come in with me now and
they might take it easy on you.

17:31.410 --> 17:32.244
It's too late for that.

17:32.364 --> 17:34.232
Don't turn around.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.667
Get in there.

17:43.380 --> 17:45.814
(Michelle): Hey.
Anything from Toby?

17:45.882 --> 17:46.653
Nothing.

17:46.773 --> 17:48.765
He left a message saying
that he was going

17:48.885 --> 17:50.415
to follow up on a lead and
now I can't get a hold of him.

17:50.535 --> 17:51.635
Can you put me through to Dev?

17:51.755 --> 17:54.723
- No sooner said than...
- Dev.

17:54.791 --> 17:58.216
Hey. Aren't I supposed to get
a warning before this connects?

17:58.336 --> 17:59.375
<I>I wrote a subroutine

17:59.495 --> 18:02.730
To disable it. I thought things might
get intense and we'd need you fast.

18:02.798 --> 18:05.233
Oh, they're getting intense.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.235
Toby hasn't checked in.
I think that he went to go look

18:07.303 --> 18:09.571
for one of the suspects himself.
Can you track his phone?

18:09.639 --> 18:12.939
Yeah. No problem.

18:13.007 --> 18:15.709
(Beeping)
His cell phone's not registered

18:15.777 --> 18:18.179
on the cell phone network.
It might be turned off.

18:18.246 --> 18:21.748
- That doesn't make any sense.
- <i>Oh, before you go,</i>

18:21.816 --> 18:24.418
I did some digging
into Economic Justice Awareness,

18:24.486 --> 18:26.853
and it is not easy. I mean,
there's no office,

18:26.921 --> 18:29.121
there's no way to contact them.
There's just an anonymous server

18:29.190 --> 18:32.758
- in Russia running a website.
- Do we know who the key players are?

18:32.826 --> 18:35.895
No, no one,
except for Dan Goodwin.

18:35.962 --> 18:37.863
Ok, I'm going to go talk
to Lori Black.

18:50.176 --> 18:53.111
You guys should think
about what you're doing here.

18:53.179 --> 18:55.847
It's the rest of society
that's not thinking.

18:55.915 --> 18:59.284
You know, they call it
the information age.

18:59.352 --> 19:02.987
It seems like the more connected they
are, the stupider they're becoming.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.559
(Man clears his throat.)

19:08.627 --> 19:12.630
You know, it's the rich that are
stealing the best for themselves

19:12.698 --> 19:16.067
and killing everyone else.

19:16.135 --> 19:18.301
You can believe whatever
you want. I don't care.

19:18.369 --> 19:22.172
Get you message out there.
Whatever.

19:22.240 --> 19:25.408
Just don't hurt anybody.

19:25.476 --> 19:28.145
Oh, you have no idea
what we're going to do.

19:33.817 --> 19:36.753
I know what you built
with the parts you stole.

19:36.820 --> 19:39.388
Ugh!

19:39.456 --> 19:42.759
You know, if they really knew anything,
they would have stopped us already.

19:42.826 --> 19:45.261
They wouldn't be perving around
your old girlfriend, right?

19:49.432 --> 19:51.567
Then how would I know how you
got into the bank's computer...

19:51.635 --> 19:53.835
Argh!

19:56.105 --> 19:58.774
How does he know that?
Tell me. How do you know that?

19:58.841 --> 20:02.311
Tell me what you know.
Tell me what you know!

20:02.379 --> 20:04.546
- I'm not gonna play your game!
- My game?

20:04.614 --> 20:06.914
You started this game.
I say when it's done.

20:06.982 --> 20:09.116
(Michelle): Ms. black.

20:09.184 --> 20:12.453
- I told Toby everything I knew.
- Toby never came back.

20:12.521 --> 20:14.889
Where he went has nothing
to do with me.

20:14.956 --> 20:17.091
Well, we believe that
your friend Dan and his group

20:17.159 --> 20:19.193
are involved in some kind
of terrorist activity.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.096
Do you really think they would
have a problem hurting Toby?

20:22.164 --> 20:27.001
I told Toby that Dan was staying
with his stepmom in Kitsilano.

20:27.068 --> 20:29.203
Did you warn Dan
that Toby was coming?

20:29.271 --> 20:31.972
I wasn't thinking.
I didn't

20:32.040 --> 20:33.644
want him to get in trouble.

20:33.764 --> 20:34.456
You're under arrest.

20:34.576 --> 20:35.090
Please...

20:35.210 --> 20:38.077
Toby trusted you.
You're gonna give me the address

20:38.145 --> 20:40.246
of his stepmother
and any other information I need

20:40.314 --> 20:42.315
or life is going to become
very difficult for you.

20:45.352 --> 20:48.721
(Kathy): <i>222 Pacific. Send
two units to meet us there.</i>

20:51.658 --> 20:53.592
Backup will be here
in five minutes.

20:53.660 --> 20:56.295
(Michelle): We can't wait.
We're going in.

21:36.735 --> 21:38.168
Nothing upstairs.

21:38.236 --> 21:40.904
Nothing down here.
Ok, call forensics.

21:40.972 --> 21:44.106
Maybe we can pull some prints.

21:44.174 --> 21:46.275
We don't know how much
he knows.

21:46.343 --> 21:49.078
- Maybe we should abort the plan.
- He's bluffing.

21:49.145 --> 21:52.181
I mean, he basically got some intel
from someone on the periphery,

21:52.249 --> 21:54.950
but he's basically guessing
our next move.

22:00.248 --> 22:03.558
- So, what are we gonna do with him?
- You know

22:03.626 --> 22:05.894
- what we have to do.
- No. No, no, no. That's not why

22:05.961 --> 22:08.629
- I got into this, man.
- You just stay with him.

22:08.697 --> 22:12.400
- Me?
- Yes.

22:12.467 --> 22:14.035
<i>You're a dead man.</i>

22:24.222 --> 22:27.891
- Kathy?
- I got the report from forensics.

22:27.959 --> 22:30.359
Aside from Dan's prints,
there are three other sets.

22:30.427 --> 22:32.462
One we assume is his stepmom's.

22:32.529 --> 22:36.066
Neither of the others turn up in any
of the criminal databases, but then,

22:36.133 --> 22:38.267
I checked
the US Border Database.

22:38.335 --> 22:40.770
<i>Turns out the subject was
questioned and printed</i>

22:40.838 --> 22:42.438
<i>Crossing into the States.</i>

22:42.506 --> 22:44.307
His name is Rudy Best.

22:44.374 --> 22:47.176
Ok. According
to the university Best attended,

22:47.244 --> 22:49.945
the guy's a certified
dyed-in-the-wool genius.

22:50.013 --> 22:54.016
Unfortunately, he's also arrogant,
angry, and somewhat of a sociopath.

22:54.136 --> 22:55.561
This guy wanted to show
just how smart he was,

22:55.681 --> 22:57.752
so he hacked into
the school's computer system.

22:57.820 --> 23:01.490
<i>He did everything from selling grades
to riddling it with data bombs.</i>

23:01.557 --> 23:04.426
- So, what radicalized him?
- <i>He got caught.</i>

23:04.494 --> 23:06.046
Looks like the head of
the IT department saw

23:06.166 --> 23:07.843
that the system was hacked
and hunted him down.

23:07.963 --> 23:09.933
Samuel Rennie. He got him.

23:10.053 --> 23:11.828
Apparently Rennie had Rudy
thrown out of school

23:11.948 --> 23:13.622
and had his academic
record invalidated.

23:14.096 --> 23:17.156
He also made sure he couldn't get hired
anywhere that Rennie had contacts.

23:17.276 --> 23:18.689
Do we have Rudy's location?

23:18.809 --> 23:21.939
It looks like Best dropped off the face
of the earth about 18 months ago.

23:22.059 --> 23:24.345
I'm still searching,
but he's managed

23:24.412 --> 23:26.313
to erase all traces
of his whereabouts since then.

23:26.381 --> 23:30.550
Don't worry. I've got
sources here. We'll find him.

23:30.618 --> 23:33.186
Lori said you were
a good guy, Dan.

23:33.254 --> 23:35.921
Why are you doing this?

23:37.100 --> 23:39.526
Save your breath.

23:39.593 --> 23:41.661
Are you good
with killing people?

23:43.631 --> 23:45.830
You don't get it, man.

23:45.898 --> 23:47.832
We're waking people up.

23:47.900 --> 23:49.701
They'll thank us.

23:49.769 --> 23:51.736
No, they're gonna put you away.

23:51.804 --> 23:53.838
We got an ID on you
from the warehouse.

23:53.906 --> 23:56.074
We're gonna get
the other guys too.

23:56.142 --> 23:59.311
Yeah? There are sacrifices
that have to be made.

23:59.379 --> 24:02.580
You know the bank took
my house?

24:02.648 --> 24:04.081
Buried me in debt.

24:04.149 --> 24:06.184
I've been working forever
just to break even.

24:06.251 --> 24:09.820
They went to war with us. Now
we're gonna go to war with them.

24:09.888 --> 24:13.658
Ok. That sucks. But this is
not the way we do it.

24:13.725 --> 24:17.494
Don't make me tape
your mouth too.

24:21.449 --> 24:24.384
Can I get some water?

24:24.452 --> 24:25.953
Please.

24:29.023 --> 24:30.590
Fine.

24:57.816 --> 24:59.384
Thanks.

25:02.521 --> 25:05.622
So, I found something more out
about Rudy Best. In university

25:05.690 --> 25:08.525
he was quite active. He was also
a member of the flying club,

25:08.593 --> 25:11.495
and until recently, he kept a
membership at a local flying club.

25:11.562 --> 25:14.631
You think he still has access? He's been
working the thefts across the country.

25:14.699 --> 25:17.134
Well, maybe he's transporting
the equipment by air.

25:17.202 --> 25:19.269
And maybe
it's his escape route.

25:19.337 --> 25:22.105
Ok, I think
we just hit pay dirt.

25:22.172 --> 25:24.508
The phone number for the flying
club came up a number of times

25:24.575 --> 25:26.610
on the call log from the place
where Dan Goodwin was staying.

25:26.677 --> 25:29.779
Call if you get anything.

25:33.050 --> 25:36.987
Lori sent me here to help you
before you got in too deep.

25:37.054 --> 25:38.888
Well, she made a mistake.

25:41.357 --> 25:45.060
What do you, um...

25:45.128 --> 25:47.754
What do you know
about her, anyway?

25:47.874 --> 25:49.632
I hurt her

25:49.699 --> 25:54.769
a long time ago. I don't want to see
her hurt again. I know you think

25:54.837 --> 25:57.672
you're helping people, but this is
not the way that change happens.

25:57.740 --> 26:02.410
Yeah, well, neither is sitting on the couch
while the bank steals all the money.

26:02.477 --> 26:04.812
And how about killing people
with that thing that you built?

26:04.880 --> 26:06.414
Hey!

26:08.417 --> 26:10.350
You want to live,

26:10.418 --> 26:12.318
you shut the hell up.

26:12.386 --> 26:16.056
(Cell phone ringing)

26:18.059 --> 26:19.560
Yeah?

26:22.830 --> 26:24.397
I told you.

27:09.641 --> 27:12.309
No! No, no, no, no! That's not
how we're doing this!

27:12.376 --> 27:16.112
I say how we do it. He has to be taken
care of. He knows what you look like, Dan.

27:16.179 --> 27:19.015
- So I'm gonna take the rap for this?
- <i>What are you, weak?</i>

27:19.083 --> 27:21.884
Look, I trusted you, Dan.
Killing him sends a message.

27:37.167 --> 27:39.268
- That's not the plan!
- This is my plan!

27:39.336 --> 27:41.036
<i>I say how we do it!</i>

27:41.104 --> 27:43.506
Rudy. Damn it!

27:45.509 --> 27:47.609
Special Consultant Logan will
be ok.

27:47.676 --> 27:50.645
- I'm sure of it.
- I hope you're right.

27:50.712 --> 27:54.315
Don't worry. We'll be there
in five minutes.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.861
Hey! Hey!

28:13.834 --> 28:15.802
Come on, man.

28:15.870 --> 28:19.238
Don't make this harder
than it already is.

28:27.648 --> 28:29.282
Hey!

28:34.320 --> 28:36.688
Dan, you're not a killer.
You don't have to do this.

28:36.755 --> 28:39.457
I don't have a choice.

28:42.669 --> 28:44.494
Think about this, Dan.

28:46.249 --> 28:47.920
Drop your weapon!

29:00.606 --> 29:02.210
You ok?

29:02.706 --> 29:03.770
Yeah.

29:08.109 --> 29:10.077
You're looking at attempted
murder of an officer

29:10.144 --> 29:12.178
and suspected acts
of terrorism.

29:12.246 --> 29:14.180
You want to try
to help yourself out here?

29:14.248 --> 29:17.084
You think I'd sell out
the cause?

29:17.151 --> 29:20.721
- That's the only move you have, Dan.
- I won't turn on him.

29:20.788 --> 29:23.388
Banks robbed us of our homes
and our future. These people are

29:23.456 --> 29:25.758
taking from us. Do you
understand? This is your loss.

29:25.826 --> 29:27.593
Every one of you has
lost something.

29:27.661 --> 29:30.529
You mean Rudy Best?
We know about him.

29:30.597 --> 29:33.132
You don't know anything.

29:33.199 --> 29:35.367
We know about the bomb.
We find Rudy,

29:35.435 --> 29:37.769
we save a lot of lives.

29:37.837 --> 29:39.838
Maybe he doesn't even know
about the bomb.

29:39.905 --> 29:43.074
Think that's it?

29:43.142 --> 29:44.943
<i>It's not what they think.</i>

29:45.011 --> 29:48.880
<i>The explosion is just</i>
<i>to energize it.</i>

29:48.948 --> 29:51.082
- Tell us what you know.
- You know,

29:51.150 --> 29:53.417
I think he doesn't know
anything. Look at him,

29:53.485 --> 29:57.320
I wouldn't trust him.
I don't think Rudy trusted him.

29:57.388 --> 30:00.590
<i>Don't tell them.</i>
<i>Don't let them know.</i>

30:00.659 --> 30:02.492
That's it.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.895
You guys are wasting your time.

30:04.963 --> 30:06.897
I want to see a lawyer.

30:06.965 --> 30:08.398
Now.

30:08.466 --> 30:10.933
Yeah. Michelle.

30:16.373 --> 30:18.274
I couldn't get through to him.

30:18.341 --> 30:20.643
I think Rudy's got him
spun around.

30:20.711 --> 30:22.812
Ok, well, I think we should
keep pushing him.

30:22.880 --> 30:26.148
Yeah. I might have got something.
I gotta check with Dev.

30:28.384 --> 30:30.485
I saw more of the device
they were making.

30:30.553 --> 30:33.855
He thought it wasn't the kind of bomb we
would expect, that the explosion is just

30:33.923 --> 30:35.924
<I>to energize the device.</I>

30:35.992 --> 30:38.126
- Ok. Can you describe it?
<I>- Yeah. There were</I>

30:38.194 --> 30:41.396
Coils of wire wrapped around armatures
with a space in the middle.

30:41.463 --> 30:43.748
And the explosives were being
packed on top of the coils?

30:43.868 --> 30:44.913
Yeah.

30:45.033 --> 30:47.681
Ok. This might all be starting
to make sense to me.

30:47.801 --> 30:48.249
How's that?

30:48.369 --> 30:50.404
<i>I've been trying to figure
out what all the stolen</i>

30:50.471 --> 30:53.640
Components could be adding up to, and what
you're describing could well be an EMP.

30:53.709 --> 30:55.943
- What's that?
- An e-bomb.

30:56.011 --> 31:00.113
It uses conventional explosives to amplify
a powerful current from a giant capacitor

31:00.181 --> 31:02.481
turning it into a giant
electromagnet.

31:02.549 --> 31:05.985
The final piece might have been that microwave
transformer they stole a few days ago.

31:06.053 --> 31:08.421
- How much damage can it do?
<i>- The explosives cause</i>

31:08.488 --> 31:10.423
<i>A certain amount
of localized damage,</i>

31:10.490 --> 31:12.759
But if the pulse from the device
is big enough, it could

31:12.827 --> 31:16.328
permanently fry the circuitry of every
electronic device within two or three blocks.

31:16.395 --> 31:18.697
I mean, we're talking cars,
cell phones, computer systems,

31:18.765 --> 31:20.432
but also medical equipment,

31:20.499 --> 31:23.001
police communication,
or emergency services.

31:23.069 --> 31:24.937
It's gonna cause
complete chaos.

31:25.004 --> 31:27.305
We need to find out where
they're planning to set it off.

31:27.373 --> 31:29.741
Hey, Kathy, could you grab me
another coffee?

31:29.808 --> 31:32.543
- On it.
- Right. Thank you.

31:32.611 --> 31:34.678
Dev, look, when I read Rudy,

31:34.747 --> 31:38.983
I saw someone accessing the employee login
screen of the Vancouver Standard Bank.

31:39.051 --> 31:41.318
Ok, there haven't been
any irregularities reported

31:41.386 --> 31:45.522
from the bank, but he could have
woven a very complicated... oh.

31:45.590 --> 31:48.024
- What?
<i>- The head of the IT security</i>

31:48.092 --> 31:51.995
at the bank, it's Samuel Rennie,
the same guy who caught Rudy

31:52.063 --> 31:54.530
<i>hacking the university computer
and got him thrown out.</i>

31:54.598 --> 31:57.667
<i>He's just finished implementing a whole
new IT security protocol at the bank.</i>

31:57.735 --> 32:00.403
- That can't be a coincidence.
- So, this is about revenge.

32:00.471 --> 32:03.005
<i>And people have done far more
for less reason.</i>

32:03.073 --> 32:06.909
If this device is an EMP, then Rudy's going
to have to get it really good and high

32:06.977 --> 32:09.912
in order to get a good spread of
the electromagnetic radiation.

32:09.980 --> 32:12.815
All right, look, the room that I saw
it in had a view of the mountains.

32:12.883 --> 32:17.753
Ok. We think that
the device is in a building

32:17.820 --> 32:20.188
next to the Vancouver
Standard Bank.

32:20.256 --> 32:23.191
There's windows facing north. Do you
have any idea what's around there?

32:23.259 --> 32:25.493
What's the radius?

32:25.560 --> 32:29.164
To be sure they'd take out their
target, I'd say a block, maybe two.

32:29.231 --> 32:31.599
It's looks like there's
three of them

32:31.667 --> 32:33.734
with top-floor
maintenance rooms

32:33.802 --> 32:35.468
with windows facing north.

32:35.536 --> 32:38.571
Give me five minutes.
I'll have access to all of them.

32:47.849 --> 32:49.582
Looks like we got lucky.

32:49.650 --> 32:52.551
I showed the building manager
photos of Rudy. He ID'd Rudy

32:52.619 --> 32:55.087
as the maintenance supervisor
for the last six months.

32:55.155 --> 32:57.556
Manager said he kept the place
running like a top.

32:57.624 --> 32:59.325
What else has he been doing?

33:14.773 --> 33:17.876
- Maybe it's not here.
- This is the place.

33:17.944 --> 33:20.712
(Electronic beeps)

33:22.647 --> 33:24.281
Go around the back.

33:24.349 --> 33:26.783
(Device beeping)

33:26.852 --> 33:29.386
Iib! Put your weapon down!

33:35.460 --> 33:36.894
Hey!

33:36.962 --> 33:39.162
(Gunshot)

33:43.968 --> 33:46.169
- He's dead.
- We're too late.

33:46.237 --> 33:47.803
It's armed.

33:50.797 --> 33:53.032
Dev, it's here
and it's active. We have less

33:53.099 --> 33:55.076
than 33 minutes. Take a look
and tell me what you think.

33:55.196 --> 33:56.082
<i>Show me the whole thing.</i>

33:56.202 --> 33:59.564
I need to see the size of it.

34:00.005 --> 34:03.374
Ok, I figure this device is
on the high end of the estimate,

34:03.442 --> 34:06.177
<I>so it'll take out hospital,
communication hubs,</I>

34:06.245 --> 34:08.812
<i>And half the financial firms
within this radius.</i>

34:08.880 --> 34:11.380
- Can you shut it down?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

34:11.449 --> 34:13.583
<i>I'm good, but this is
way out of my league.</i>

34:13.652 --> 34:15.318
To shut it down,
you're gonna need a code.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.353
<i>Vancouver bomb squad is
on its way,</i>

34:17.422 --> 34:20.290
<i>But it's probably set to go off if
anyone starts tampering with the wiring.</i>

34:20.358 --> 34:22.292
You stay here and work
with emergency services

34:22.360 --> 34:24.293
to evacuate the building.
If time gets short,

34:24.362 --> 34:26.329
get the hell out of here
as quickly as possible.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.464
I've got no problem with that.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.712
Take the cuffs off her.

34:43.780 --> 34:45.681
Can you leave us alone?

34:45.748 --> 34:48.483
Toby. I am so sorry.

34:48.551 --> 34:50.552
I had no idea.

34:50.620 --> 34:53.889
It's ok. Dan and his friends put
a bomb in a building downtown.

34:53.956 --> 34:55.791
I need you to talk to him.

34:55.858 --> 34:58.226
We need to know
where his friend Rudy is.

34:58.294 --> 35:00.995
Can't you take it
out of his head?

35:01.063 --> 35:03.831
Even when people cooperate,
I only get glimpses.

35:03.899 --> 35:06.801
We need someone that he trusts
to help focus him.

35:06.868 --> 35:09.804
We've got less than 30 minutes
before this thing goes off.

35:09.871 --> 35:12.106
A lot of innocent people
will die.

35:24.952 --> 35:26.886
What the hell are you
doing here?

35:26.954 --> 35:28.888
(Door closing)

35:28.956 --> 35:31.690
They arrested me
for helping you.

35:31.758 --> 35:34.227
I didn't mean for it
to happen like this.

35:34.294 --> 35:37.396
They say you made a bomb?

35:37.464 --> 35:40.600
Don't. Don't let them
do this.

35:40.667 --> 35:43.068
Don't let them take advantage
of you like this.

35:43.137 --> 35:45.771
Tell me the truth.

35:49.308 --> 35:51.209
Dan,

35:51.277 --> 35:52.910
tell me how to stop it.

35:52.978 --> 35:55.113
I'm not the one
that can stop it.

35:55.181 --> 36:00.418
(Lori): <i>Then tell me where
the person who can stop it is.</i>

36:00.486 --> 36:02.454
I don't know.

36:02.522 --> 36:06.923
<i>Don't tell them.</i>
<i>Don't tell them.</i>

36:09.994 --> 36:11.928
Dan, please.

36:11.996 --> 36:15.966
I don't want you
to be a killer.

36:17.332 --> 36:20.770
There's still a way
for this to be ok.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.448
He's in Stanley Park
under the bridge.

36:36.352 --> 36:38.353
He wants to watch the show.

36:43.125 --> 36:46.695
I need a unit to meet us at Stanley
Park across from Coal Harbour.

36:46.762 --> 36:50.232
I'll send a picture of the suspect from the car.
Nobody makes a move until we get there.

36:50.300 --> 36:53.334
(Sirens)

36:59.474 --> 37:01.875
Dev: <i>Kathy, how are you
holding up?</i>

37:01.943 --> 37:05.045
I'm fine. I'm good.

37:05.113 --> 37:07.314
Look, there's less than
10 minutes till it blows, ok?

37:07.381 --> 37:09.949
Even though it's not a conventional bomb,
the amount of explosive in it could take

37:10.017 --> 37:12.552
the top off the building,
so please get yourself far away.

37:12.620 --> 37:14.688
Michelle and Toby said they'd
get the code here on time.

37:14.755 --> 37:17.023
Somebody needs to be here
to get it to the bomb squad.

37:17.091 --> 37:20.727
- Just get out of there.
- I'll be in touch.

37:29.068 --> 37:32.204
(People shouting)
(Police radio chatter)

37:32.272 --> 37:34.773
(Sirens)

37:34.841 --> 37:36.875
Rudy!

37:36.943 --> 37:39.111
On your feet!

37:39.178 --> 37:41.145
Hands where I can see them!

37:41.213 --> 37:43.448
- Ok.
- Turn around.

37:43.515 --> 37:45.115
- You're too late.
- You think so?

37:45.235 --> 37:46.332
Yeah.

37:46.452 --> 37:49.019
We know all about you, Rudy.
You're not an idealist.

37:49.087 --> 37:51.356
This isn't about
punishing the bank, is it?

37:51.423 --> 37:53.691
(Rudy): <i>I've already got</i>
<i>the money offshore.</i>

37:53.759 --> 37:54.537
<i>It'll ruin him.</i>

37:54.657 --> 37:56.874
<i>The money's just a bonus.
This is about revenge</i>

37:56.994 --> 38:00.997
on Samuel Rennie. He destroyed your life, so
you were gonna break his security system.

38:01.065 --> 38:03.734
Steal the money,
crash the bank's system,

38:03.801 --> 38:06.169
move the money through offshore
accounts. Before they even

38:06.237 --> 38:10.173
figured it out, you'd be gone. You just
wanted him to know that you'd beaten him.

38:10.241 --> 38:12.275
You were willing
to hurt all these people

38:12.342 --> 38:15.278
- to get revenge on one man?
- You're crazy.

38:15.345 --> 38:17.813
See, you thought you had me
trapped, man, but I had you.

38:17.881 --> 38:20.314
I was inside your head.
I got the code word.

38:20.434 --> 38:21.125
Stop it.

38:21.245 --> 38:24.253
<i>- I'll never give it up.</i>
<i>- You wanted to keep it</i>

38:24.321 --> 38:26.522
a secret, but even now,
you can't help

38:26.590 --> 38:28.657
- but think about it.
- Stop.

38:28.724 --> 38:32.059
<i>He can't know his name. It's
your enemy's name, isn't it?</i>

38:32.127 --> 38:36.498
This isn't about social justice;
it's about your weak ego.

38:36.565 --> 38:39.267
"Samuel Rennie" is
the code word.

38:39.335 --> 38:40.769
Who the hell are you?

38:40.836 --> 38:42.937
Kathy.

38:43.005 --> 38:45.939
- Michelle, have you got it?
- The code is "Samuel Rennie".

38:46.007 --> 38:49.176
- Are you sure?
- <i>Yes. It's our only shot.</i>

38:49.243 --> 38:51.912
The code is a name. "Samuel

38:51.979 --> 38:55.482
Rennie." R-e-n-n-i-e.

38:57.952 --> 39:01.387
(Soft whirring sound)

39:01.455 --> 39:03.956
It worked.

39:04.024 --> 39:07.026
(Michelle): Ok.

39:08.667 --> 39:11.297
Cut that pretty close.

39:11.365 --> 39:14.767
I want to get Dev his salmon
before we head back.

39:14.835 --> 39:16.401
Let's go.

39:23.209 --> 39:24.876
<i>Ok, so, she's there</i>

39:24.944 --> 39:28.246
<i>staring at what is most
certainly death, and she just</i>

39:28.314 --> 39:32.916
turns around, goes right
back in, and just shuts it down.

39:32.984 --> 39:35.152
Sounds like you have a new fan.

39:35.220 --> 39:38.522
Well, apparently,
he's the head of the fan club.

39:38.590 --> 39:42.960
Kathy, if you ever find yourself out
this way, I've got a job for you.

39:43.027 --> 39:45.996
You never know. I just might
take you up on that.

39:46.064 --> 39:49.599
See you guys
back at the office.

39:49.667 --> 39:52.902
- Seriously, you guys, that was great work.
- It was great to observe you

39:52.970 --> 39:55.104
in action. There's still
some things I'm wondering about,

39:55.172 --> 39:57.841
though, like how you got him
to give up the code.

39:57.908 --> 40:00.610
- It's top secret, right?
- You got it.

40:00.678 --> 40:03.112
(Chuckling)
It was great working with you.

40:03.180 --> 40:05.814
- Same. Thanks, Kathy.
- Thank you.

40:05.882 --> 40:08.717
I think we have enough time to grab
a bite to eat before our flight.

40:08.785 --> 40:11.854
For the record, you were right. I should
have read Lori from the beginning.

40:11.921 --> 40:14.857
Yeah, well, in this job, sometimes you
have to make some tough decisions.

40:14.924 --> 40:19.094
Yeah, I'm beginning
to learn that.

40:19.161 --> 40:21.529
- Can you, uh...
- Yeah.

40:21.597 --> 40:23.163
Thank you.

40:25.401 --> 40:27.568
Didn't they let you go,

40:27.636 --> 40:29.069
like, a while ago?

40:29.137 --> 40:30.571
They did. I, uh,

40:30.639 --> 40:33.040
I just wanted to see you
before I left.

40:33.108 --> 40:34.876
Here I am.

40:37.111 --> 40:38.945
You made a big
difference today.

40:41.449 --> 40:45.952
Toby, if this girl is
the one...

40:46.020 --> 40:48.388
You need to be
honest with her.

40:48.456 --> 40:50.724
You deserve

40:50.792 --> 40:52.491
to be happy.

40:52.559 --> 40:55.227
So do you.

40:55.295 --> 40:57.062
It's good seeing you.

40:57.130 --> 40:58.731
Yeah.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.741
That's almost it. It's close.

41:09.809 --> 41:12.376
That'll work.
He plays one note.

41:12.445 --> 41:14.995
You know what?
Much better when you play it.

41:15.115 --> 41:17.442
Yeah, I think the whole bar
would agree on that, my friend.

41:17.562 --> 41:18.631
(Man): Walk Off The Earth!

41:18.751 --> 41:20.718
- All right, man, thanks.
- We'll see you after the show.

41:20.786 --> 41:23.721
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
Please help yourselves.

41:23.789 --> 41:26.324
