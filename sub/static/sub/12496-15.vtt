they're bad guys?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.208
- Well...

17:49.250 --> 17:50.875
Two of them are trying

17:49.250 --> 17:50.875
to break Phoebe's leg,

17:50.917 --> 17:53.667
and one of them's tryin'

17:50.917 --> 17:53.667
to eat Henry's arm,

17:53.709 --> 17:55.959
so they don't

17:53.709 --> 17:55.959
seem super nice.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.333
[ shouting ]

17:59.375 --> 18:01.417
- What are you?

17:59.375 --> 18:01.417
You- you're so weird!

18:01.458 --> 18:02.834
- Quit biting his arm!

18:02.875 --> 18:04.625
- Yes! Hurt them!

18:02.875 --> 18:04.625
I love it!

18:04.667 --> 18:06.417
[ cackles ]

18:06.458 --> 18:07.834
- Stop that!

18:07.875 --> 18:10.875
- Oww! My leg doesn't

18:07.875 --> 18:10.875
bend that way!

18:10.917 --> 18:13.000
- Here, open this case!

18:14.417 --> 18:15.750
- Man-grenades?

18:15.792 --> 18:17.834
- By Schwoz!

18:17.875 --> 18:20.250
- Enter 1239.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.041
[ grunting ]

18:28.375 --> 18:31.959
- Hey! How am I supposed to

18:28.375 --> 18:31.959
use the bathroom?

18:33.667 --> 18:36.000
Hurry up, I gotta pee!

18:43.667 --> 18:44.917
[ cackling ]

18:46.250 --> 18:48.250
- Kid Danger!

18:48.291 --> 18:51.792
- Put that in here,

18:48.291 --> 18:51.792
pull back on this,

18:51.834 --> 18:53.750
and aim it at Ray!

18:53.792 --> 18:56.750
- Are you insane?

18:53.792 --> 18:56.750
- Yah, do it!

19:02.166 --> 19:05.333
- Charlotte!

19:02.166 --> 19:05.333
- What?

19:05.375 --> 19:08.041
- Don't miss.

19:17.667 --> 19:20.709
- Huh, what's that?

19:20.750 --> 19:22.041
- Whoa!

19:25.625 --> 19:27.458
- Dang dude!

19:29.709 --> 19:33.375
- Hey! What exploded?

19:37.458 --> 19:39.125
- Captain Man?

19:39.166 --> 19:40.542
- What happened?

19:39.166 --> 19:40.542
- Where'd he go?

19:40.583 --> 19:43.917
- Oh, looks like

19:40.583 --> 19:43.917
Captain Man exploded!

19:43.959 --> 19:46.709
- Ding dong,

19:43.959 --> 19:46.709
the Captain's dead!

19:46.750 --> 19:48.792
[ cackling ]

19:48.834 --> 19:51.750
- Yes! Swellview is ours!

19:51.792 --> 19:52.959
[ shouting, laughing ]

19:58.709 --> 20:00.792
- Captain Man!

20:00.834 --> 20:03.834
- Ooh, sorry Kid--he's dead.

20:03.875 --> 20:07.291
Which makes it very difficult

20:03.875 --> 20:07.291
for him to help you now.

20:07.333 --> 20:10.709
Or maybe you're too stupid

20:07.333 --> 20:10.709
to realize that it's a new day

20:10.750 --> 20:15.375
in Swellview, because nobody

20:10.750 --> 20:15.375
has to worry about Captain--

20:20.375 --> 20:22.208
- Toddler...

20:22.250 --> 20:23.750
it's time for your nap.

20:23.792 --> 20:25.125
- No, no, no,

20:23.792 --> 20:25.125
wait, wait, wait,

20:25.166 --> 20:27.875
I already took a nap right

20:25.166 --> 20:27.875
after lunch...

20:32.125 --> 20:34.917
- Wow, this is uncomfortable.

20:34.959 --> 20:40.291
- Don't get nervous, it's still

20:34.959 --> 20:40.291
six of us against three of them.

20:42.542 --> 20:43.458
[ whimpering ]

20:47.750 --> 20:50.375
- Okay, now it's

20:47.750 --> 20:50.375

21:50.792 --> 21:52.542
if you hadn't

21:50.792 --> 21:52.542
blown our cover.

21:52.583 --> 21:54.333
- That's right, Max.

21:54.375 --> 21:57.959
- Uh, well,

22:09.208 --> 22:10.875
You guys forgive him?!?

22:10.917 --> 22:12.458
- Sure.

22:10.917 --> 22:12.458
- Totally.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.625
- See? They're cool.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.458
- Aw, yeah.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.458
- We're soooo cool.

22:17.500 --> 22:21.333
- So, we were gonna give Phoebe

22:17.500 --> 22:21.333
a ride home in our helicopter.

22:21.375 --> 22:23.375
- You want us to give

22:21.375 --> 22:23.375
you a ride, too?

22:23.417 --> 22:25.000
- Seriously?
