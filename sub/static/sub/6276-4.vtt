Ma'am, $275 is
the-the lowest I can go.

15:37.208 --> 15:40.959
I-I mean, the prices
are on the handlebars.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.750
There are cheaper bikes
on Craigslist.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.291
Hey.

15:45.542 --> 15:47.458
If you could have any bike,

15:47.542 --> 15:49.083
what kind would you want?

15:49.166 --> 15:50.750
I don't know.

15:52.041 --> 15:53.458
Well, tell me
about your lifestyle.

15:53.542 --> 15:54.750
I don't know what that means.

15:54.834 --> 15:57.375
Well, where you
gonna be riding it,

15:57.458 --> 16:00.667
hmm?
Dirt, gravel?

16:00.750 --> 16:03.041
I want to ride on the sidewalk.

16:03.125 --> 16:04.458
You want to
pop wheelies?

16:04.542 --> 16:05.667
BOY:
Nothing crazy.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.542
Okay. I hear you.

16:07.625 --> 16:09.792
I hear you.

16:12.625 --> 16:13.959
(short laugh)
Hi.

16:14.041 --> 16:14.625
Hi.

16:14.709 --> 16:17.709
Listen, I overheard, uh,

16:17.792 --> 16:21.041
I think I can put something
together for you.

16:21.125 --> 16:21.542
Oh...

16:21.625 --> 16:25.333
Thanks, but we...

16:25.417 --> 16:26.875
we don't have a lot of money.

16:26.959 --> 16:28.875
We shouldn't have even come in.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.625
Come back later this afternoon.

16:34.709 --> 16:37.792
I think I can find something
that works for the both of you.

16:50.583 --> 16:51.583
Oh! Oh!

16:51.667 --> 16:54.375
What the fuck?

16:54.458 --> 16:57.083
(panicked breathing)

16:57.166 --> 16:58.792
You told the cops
you saw the shooting?

16:58.875 --> 17:01.208
(stammers)
I panicked, Ray.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.625
I d... I-I can't go to prison.
Everybody thinks

17:03.709 --> 17:06.750
I set Sully up. I go to prison,
Sully's guys'll kill me.

17:06.834 --> 17:08.500
What's the first
fucking thing you learn

17:08.583 --> 17:10.959
when you're five years old
on Dorchester Street?

17:11.041 --> 17:12.875
(whimpers)
Huh?

17:12.959 --> 17:15.000
You don't fucking talk
to the cops!

17:15.083 --> 17:16.208
(sobs)

17:16.291 --> 17:18.750
Jesus fucking Christ, Tiny.

17:18.834 --> 17:20.583
You didn't see
the press conference?

17:20.667 --> 17:22.125
You know how we're playing this?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.625
Are you out of your
fucking mind?
I'm sorry, Ray.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.458
Stand him up.
No.

17:26.542 --> 17:27.875
No, no, no.
Over there.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.959
Don't, no, no.
Come on.

17:30.041 --> 17:31.542
No, Ray, no.
No, no.

17:31.625 --> 17:34.083
Don't... No...
(crying)

17:34.166 --> 17:35.834
Don't shoot me, Ray.

17:35.917 --> 17:36.458
Don't shoot me.
Look at me, Tiny.

17:36.542 --> 17:38.709
Look at me.

17:44.792 --> 17:46.959
(shutter clicks)

17:47.041 --> 17:49.083
What're you gonna do, Ray?

17:49.166 --> 17:51.542
Make sure he doesn't take one
fucking step out of this room.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.458
You understand me, Av?
Okay.

18:13.041 --> 18:15.709
Cochran doesn't trust you.

18:15.792 --> 18:18.000
He'll be out
of the country by tonight.

18:19.542 --> 18:20.583
So, what, Ray?

18:20.667 --> 18:21.208
You just a fucking
travel agent now?

18:27.750 --> 18:31.917
Look at Frank Barnes
with his brand-new balls.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.041
Let me ask you
something, Frank.

18:35.125 --> 18:37.792
You think Cochran's gonna look
after you when this is all over?

18:43.792 --> 18:46.709
(low, indistinct chatter)

18:53.792 --> 18:55.875
I'm back.

18:58.125 --> 18:59.500
Where the fuck is everybody?

18:59.583 --> 19:01.291
NARRATOR (on TV):
On the northwest coast
of Ireland.

19:06.625 --> 19:09.083
These mountains by the sea
were the final strongholds

19:09.166 --> 19:09.667
of the earls of Tír Chonaill

19:09.750 --> 19:12.583
and Tyrone.

19:15.125 --> 19:18.875
Remote. Beautiful.

19:18.959 --> 19:22.166
What are you, depressed?

19:22.250 --> 19:23.667
What are you watching
this shit for?

19:23.750 --> 19:25.625
I'm moving there.

19:25.709 --> 19:27.583
Oh, yeah?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.959
I'd go, too,

19:30.041 --> 19:31.250
if I could.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.166
You know what your brother's
doing to me?

19:34.792 --> 19:36.875
Starving me to death.

19:36.959 --> 19:39.458
There, there, look.

19:39.542 --> 19:40.834
I'm not supposed
to live like this.

19:40.917 --> 19:44.542
This is America.

19:44.625 --> 19:47.750
You know what we got to do?

19:47.834 --> 19:48.917
Another Fite Nite, Terr.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.291
What do you say?

19:51.375 --> 19:53.625
DARYLL:
Hey, Terry, guess what--
I'm up to five...

19:54.709 --> 19:56.542
...miles.

20:01.250 --> 20:03.625
What the fuck?
You're driving again?

20:03.709 --> 20:06.083
Yeah, I am.

20:06.166 --> 20:07.083
Terry and me--
just talking about

20:07.166 --> 20:08.083
you getting back in the ring.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.875
Don't put words in my mouth.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.542
DARYLL:
Are you serious?

20:11.625 --> 20:14.542
I'm not getting back in the ring
for you, Mick. You sold me out.

20:14.625 --> 20:15.750
Fuck that.

20:15.834 --> 20:18.583
What's with him, huh?

20:18.667 --> 20:21.291
What'd you go back to
being a chauffeur for?

20:21.375 --> 20:22.500
That's demeaning.

20:27.875 --> 20:31.458
I am making a living, Pop.

20:31.542 --> 20:34.333
I made you a living.

20:34.417 --> 20:34.709
I still can.

20:34.792 --> 20:38.083
(laughs)

20:38.166 --> 20:39.417
Wow.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.333
You know... You know, Mom
used to tell me these stories

20:42.417 --> 20:44.166
about the great Mickey Donovan.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.166
How people looked at you
with respect.

20:46.250 --> 20:49.000
What a fucking joke.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.750
Like, why do you
got to be so fucked up, Mick?

20:50.834 --> 20:52.333
Why do you got to be
such an asshole?

20:52.417 --> 20:54.750
All right.
Don't get all emotional.

21:05.041 --> 21:07.125
Anything on this guy?

21:07.208 --> 21:08.834
No, he's a fucking
Boy Scout, Ray.

21:08.917 --> 21:10.875
He loves his wife,

21:10.959 --> 21:12.417
he plays classic rock
on the weekends

21:12.500 --> 21:14.917
and he only hangs out with
other guys in law enforcement.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.500
Here.

21:16.583 --> 21:19.667
Is that Tiny?
Yeah. How quick
can you get me

21:19.750 --> 21:21.458
a passport, ticket to the
Maldives and 15 grand in cash?

21:21.542 --> 21:24.333
Oh, you... got to give me
at least a day.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.542
Got two hours.

21:27.917 --> 21:30.208
(phone rings)

21:30.291 --> 21:31.375
Yeah?
DEB: Congratulations.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.000
They accepted the offer
on the Trousdale house.

21:34.083 --> 21:34.917
Okay.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.375
I need a check for
a million in 24 hours.

21:37.458 --> 21:38.583
Is that a problem?

21:38.667 --> 21:40.583
No. Not a problem, Deb.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.792
(sighs)

21:46.875 --> 21:48.041
Put Ezra on the phone.

21:48.125 --> 21:52.166
It's Ray Donovan.

21:52.250 --> 21:54.125
Sorry, Ray. Ezra's in a meeting.

21:54.208 --> 21:54.792
He's been in a meeting
for two days.

21:54.875 --> 21:57.375
That's right.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.417
(rope skipping,
gloves hitting heavy bags)

22:08.291 --> 22:11.333
(panting and groaning)

22:13.500 --> 22:15.458
You look tough. (laughs)

22:16.792 --> 22:18.750
I've been managing
fighters down in Mexico.

22:18.834 --> 22:19.750
Yeah?

22:19.834 --> 22:22.583
I'm back in the States
looking for new blood.

22:22.667 --> 22:24.250
What's your
fighting weight?

22:24.333 --> 22:25.792
165.

22:25.875 --> 22:28.709
165. Here. Dig, dig, dig.

22:28.792 --> 22:30.166
Boom, boom! You've
got some power.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.250
See, I found a way
for my fighters

22:32.333 --> 22:35.041
to make real money
down there.

22:35.125 --> 22:36.500
How's that?

22:36.583 --> 22:38.834
Well, a guy like you,
with the right management,

22:38.917 --> 22:40.166
pick up some serious dough,

22:40.250 --> 22:42.417
but you got to learn
to take a fall.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.667
TERRY:
That's enough, Mick.

22:48.750 --> 22:50.458
What did I do?

22:50.542 --> 22:52.959
Get the fuck out of here.

22:53.041 --> 22:53.834
I run a clean establishment.

22:53.917 --> 22:56.542
Terry...

22:56.625 --> 22:57.667
Get out.

23:01.083 --> 23:02.917
You still blame me
for the Parkinson's.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.125
That it?

23:04.208 --> 23:07.959
I told you not to go the full
12 rounds with Chuy Gomez.

23:08.041 --> 23:10.917
I don't throw fights.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.834
Go home, Mick.

23:21.959 --> 23:24.083
See you later.

23:29.875 --> 23:34.166
(enunciating):
I parked the car,
and I walked across the yard.

23:35.583 --> 23:37.458
I parked the car,

23:37.542 --> 23:39.583
and I walked across the yard.

23:44.917 --> 23:47.000
Parked the car...

23:47.083 --> 23:49.041
(whispering):
and I walked across...

23:50.041 --> 23:52.125
(sniffing)

23:56.917 --> 23:58.000
FINKEL:
Can you be more specific,
Jackson?

23:58.083 --> 24:01.000
I don't know.

24:01.083 --> 24:03.583
What exactly about life
makes you think

24:03.667 --> 24:05.583
it's all a-a game?

24:05.667 --> 24:08.208
I don't know.

24:08.291 --> 24:10.083
He's fucking someone
else, you asshole!

24:10.166 --> 24:11.542
Are you happy now?

24:11.625 --> 24:14.291
Abby...
You're the one
who called it rape.

24:14.375 --> 24:16.834
You put that in my head, that
my own husband was raping me.
Abby. Abby.

24:16.917 --> 24:18.875
Abby, I have a patient!

24:23.000 --> 24:24.542
(elevator bell dings)

24:24.625 --> 24:27.375
Ray, he doesn't
want to see you.

24:28.792 --> 24:31.625
You're not taking my calls? Huh?

24:31.709 --> 24:33.500
Huh?

24:33.583 --> 24:35.375
You disappointed me, Raymond.

24:35.458 --> 24:38.000
I sent you to collect that
money from June Wilson,

24:38.083 --> 24:39.125
and you didn't do it.

24:39.208 --> 24:40.166
Don't you know
what that means?

24:40.250 --> 24:44.250
June Wilson didn't pay,
and Arthur Rosen heard,

24:44.333 --> 24:48.625
and he didn't pay, and when
Arthur doesn't pay, no one pays.

24:50.792 --> 24:54.041
You're right, Ezra.

24:54.125 --> 24:56.166
I'm sorry.

24:56.250 --> 24:57.208
June Wilson pledged you
$5 million,

24:57.291 --> 25:00.166
and I'm gonna get it for you.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.250
Thank you, Raymond.

25:02.333 --> 25:04.166
But I'm keeping 20%.

25:04.250 --> 25:06.166
That's Ruth's money.

25:06.250 --> 25:07.041
20%, or you're on your own.

25:07.125 --> 25:09.917
How dare you?!

25:10.000 --> 25:13.291
What gives you the right
to dictate terms to me?

25:13.375 --> 25:15.625
Because I do your fucking
dirty work, Ezra.

25:15.709 --> 25:18.959
All you think about is the RGOCC
and your fucking legacy.

25:19.041 --> 25:19.834
Ruth was everything to me.

25:19.917 --> 25:22.750
Yeah?

25:22.834 --> 25:25.250
Well, I got a family, too.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.250
Want me to shake down
an old friend, I'll do it,

25:27.333 --> 25:30.208
but it's gonna cost you.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.583
(click, puts gun down)

25:43.667 --> 25:44.792
(sighs)

25:53.500 --> 25:56.417
You didn't come here
to practice.

25:57.333 --> 25:58.625
Excuse me?

25:58.709 --> 26:02.625
You just came
to fire that gun, right?

26:02.709 --> 26:03.834
Exorcize your demons.

26:07.458 --> 26:09.834
That gun of yours--
it's a beauty.

26:09.917 --> 26:12.792
Yup.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.792
It was a gift...

26:14.875 --> 26:16.750
from my husband.

26:17.792 --> 26:22.125
That's a brave man,
gives a gun to his wife.

26:22.208 --> 26:24.125
We were younger then.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.250
Fucking optimistic.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.166
Well, he knows his weapons.

26:28.250 --> 26:30.333
It's a good one.

26:30.417 --> 26:33.208
It's just... it's not
the right size for your hand.

26:33.291 --> 26:34.250
Oh, it's fine.

26:34.333 --> 26:37.208
Here, try this one.

26:38.667 --> 26:39.750
Go ahead.

26:42.792 --> 26:44.792
How's that feel?

26:44.875 --> 26:46.792
Okay.

26:46.875 --> 26:49.000
Feels okay.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.166
Just okay?

26:52.083 --> 26:54.166
Feels good.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.709
Let her rip.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.917
(click)

27:24.792 --> 27:25.917
Hey, Mickey.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.291
(laughs)

27:44.375 --> 27:47.250
Why the long face?

27:52.458 --> 27:56.000
You believe this shit?

27:56.083 --> 27:58.208
I got a shit job in
a Mexican restaurant.

27:58.291 --> 28:00.417
Now my sons all turn
their backs on me.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.959
Man, this is almost
a hundred bucks.

28:05.208 --> 28:07.125
(laughs)

28:07.208 --> 28:09.750
Right?

28:09.834 --> 28:10.875
Look at you.

28:10.959 --> 28:14.667
You got fucking cancer,
they throw you out of the can,

28:14.750 --> 28:17.125
put you
in this fucking shit hole.

28:17.208 --> 28:19.875
You always got a smile
on your face.

28:24.291 --> 28:26.208
Here, give me a hit.

28:26.291 --> 28:28.417
I thought
you were being tested.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.542
I already pissed
this morning.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.917
Not gonna test me
twice in one day.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.834
(laughs)

28:52.750 --> 28:53.834
June isn't home.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.792
It's all right.

28:57.875 --> 28:59.000
I can wait.

29:00.208 --> 29:03.208
Ray.

29:03.291 --> 29:04.792
Don't put your hands
on me, Carlo.

29:04.875 --> 29:08.250
Like I said, she is not home,

29:08.333 --> 29:10.208
so you need to go...

29:10.291 --> 29:12.834
(groaning)

29:12.917 --> 29:14.208
(groaning continues)

29:14.291 --> 29:17.792
(sighs, gasps)

29:24.500 --> 29:27.500
So, may I fix you a drink?

29:27.583 --> 29:29.333
No.

29:29.417 --> 29:33.000
All business.

29:33.083 --> 29:35.959
I told you Ezra won't
take no for an answer.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.458
(sighs)

29:43.041 --> 29:44.166
Did you look inside
that envelope?

29:44.250 --> 29:46.458
No.

29:46.542 --> 29:48.458
Mm. Open it.

29:48.542 --> 29:51.083
Go ahead, open it.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.834
That's my daughter Alison.

30:02.917 --> 30:05.333
I've kept her hidden
her entire life.

30:05.417 --> 30:06.834
You must think that's

30:06.917 --> 30:10.041
a horrible thing
to do, right? Hmm?

30:13.917 --> 30:15.875
I'm not judging you, June.

30:15.959 --> 30:17.291
No, you're just extorting me.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.959
(laughs)

30:20.041 --> 30:22.250
Ezra wants that money.

30:24.458 --> 30:27.333
I'm sure he does.

30:29.041 --> 30:32.125
Ezra helped me hide
her, and he said,

30:32.208 --> 30:33.291
"Nobody will
ever know."

30:33.375 --> 30:35.333
The problem is,

30:35.417 --> 30:37.417
Ezra knew.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.875
I worked with

30:39.959 --> 30:43.834
Mr. Lean, Mr. Hitchcock,
Billy Wilder.

30:43.917 --> 30:46.750
I've been nominated
for an Oscar

30:46.834 --> 30:49.583
four times.

30:49.667 --> 30:52.792
I will not let this be
what I'm remembered for.

30:58.542 --> 31:00.500
I'm sorry, June.

31:00.583 --> 31:01.750
Oh, don't
act so sad.

31:01.834 --> 31:04.875
Ezra pays you very, very well

31:04.959 --> 31:06.083
to do the things you do.

31:10.959 --> 31:13.417
If there's ever anything
you need...

31:13.500 --> 31:15.583
Thanks.

31:19.709 --> 31:22.709
But I won't be seeing you again.

31:46.375 --> 31:47.917
Hey.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.041
Hey.

31:51.208 --> 31:53.125
Do you like it?

31:53.208 --> 31:55.458
Cool.
Why don't you go
take it for a spin?

31:55.542 --> 31:58.375
Come on now.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.375
It's awesome.

32:01.458 --> 32:04.208
Thank you.

32:04.291 --> 32:06.375
Whoo.

32:13.542 --> 32:15.333
Thank you.

32:15.417 --> 32:16.375
He loves it.

32:16.458 --> 32:19.000
(laughs)

32:19.083 --> 32:22.583
Uh, my name is Patty.

32:22.667 --> 32:25.667
Uh, that's Clifford.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.125
Brendan.

32:27.208 --> 32:30.500
Uh, but everyone
calls me Bunchy.

32:30.583 --> 32:31.792
Bunchy. (laughs)

32:31.875 --> 32:35.417
That's a...
that's a funny name.

32:40.083 --> 32:44.041
Hey, there's a...
this little Mexican joint

32:44.125 --> 32:47.208
around the corner
that we're going to later.

32:47.291 --> 32:49.625
Do you...
do you want to join us?

32:50.583 --> 32:53.709
Uh, okay.

32:53.792 --> 32:56.041
Great.

32:56.125 --> 32:59.333
Great.

33:12.083 --> 33:14.041
Abby.

33:15.417 --> 33:17.917
Here.

33:19.125 --> 33:20.792
You're a cop?

33:20.875 --> 33:22.625
I'm a detective with the LAPD.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.417
Don't hold it against me.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.166
Why are you giving me this?

33:26.250 --> 33:28.667
Well, you never know when
you're gonna get in trouble.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.792
If you do, you give me a call.

33:30.875 --> 33:34.583
So I should only call you
if I get in trouble?

33:44.667 --> 33:45.875
(truck door closes)

33:45.959 --> 33:47.250
(engine starts)

33:49.166 --> 33:51.208
(phone rings)

33:52.166 --> 33:54.709
Your father's
in pretty damn good shape.

33:54.792 --> 33:56.583
Yeah, I heard you
paid him a visit.

33:56.667 --> 33:58.041
Well, his parole officer
just happened to stop by,

33:58.125 --> 34:00.875
so we didn't get
a chance to talk.

34:00.959 --> 34:02.959
Know something about that, Ray?

34:03.041 --> 34:04.750
Well, just because we fucked

34:04.834 --> 34:07.875
doesn't mean
I'm not gonna do my job.

34:11.709 --> 34:14.250
(crowd cheering on TV)

34:17.000 --> 34:18.834
Get up. We're going.

34:18.917 --> 34:20.792
Where?
The Maldives.

34:20.875 --> 34:23.125
The Maldives? I-I don't
even know where that is.

34:23.208 --> 34:24.625
Indian Ocean.
It's beautiful.

34:24.709 --> 34:26.959
You been there?

34:27.041 --> 34:29.166
No.
But you seen pictures?

34:29.250 --> 34:31.792
I seen pictures of a piece
of paper that says they
don't extradite, all right?

34:31.875 --> 34:33.458
The natives there,
are they friendly?

34:33.542 --> 34:35.542
You don't need to worry
about the natives, Tiny.

34:35.625 --> 34:36.959
The natives need
to worry about you.

34:37.041 --> 34:41.417
Come on.
We got a plane to catch.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.625
Okay...

34:43.709 --> 34:45.333
I just got to piss first.

34:49.041 --> 34:49.500
(door opens)

34:49.583 --> 34:51.750
(sighs)

34:51.834 --> 34:53.917
(door closes)

34:54.000 --> 34:55.917
How's your mother?

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Mm-mm. Don't ask.

34:58.083 --> 35:00.750
She had a fight
with her bridge partner,

35:00.834 --> 35:02.000
and now she calls me
five times a...

35:02.083 --> 35:05.834
(loud crash)
(Tony gasps, groans)

35:06.875 --> 35:08.959
(Tiny sobbing)

35:11.333 --> 35:15.000
(grunts) Oh, I-I think
I pulled my hamstring.

35:15.083 --> 35:17.250
(Tiny grunts, groans)

35:17.333 --> 35:19.583
We're gonna have
to stitch him up.

35:19.667 --> 35:20.875
I ain't going there, Ray!

35:20.959 --> 35:22.834
Let me just go
back to Boston.

35:22.917 --> 35:24.750
I swear, you'll never
hear from me again.

35:24.834 --> 35:25.458
Just let me go
back to Boston.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.542
Shut up.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.709
You're getting
on that fuckin' plane, Tiny.

35:32.291 --> 35:34.834
MICKEY:
When I was in Walpole...

35:34.917 --> 35:37.250
I read this book about
why people hate.

35:37.333 --> 35:42.291
(chuckling):
The oxygen makes it even better.

35:42.375 --> 35:43.750
Complicated book.

35:43.834 --> 35:45.625
Boiled down...

35:46.583 --> 35:50.250
...that all hate comes
from the inside out.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.625
Do you believe
that kind of shit?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.750
(chuckles)
I don't fuckin' know.

36:00.834 --> 36:02.750
I like everybody.

36:02.834 --> 36:04.542
Makes life easier.

36:07.625 --> 36:10.166
(sniffing)

36:15.667 --> 36:17.333
Oh.
(laughs)

36:17.417 --> 36:19.500
(continues laughing)

36:21.375 --> 36:23.583
Oh... I see
what you mean.

36:23.667 --> 36:26.333
(exhales)

36:27.959 --> 36:30.709
DOLPHIN:
Mickey.

36:30.792 --> 36:33.083
Mickey.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.875
(exhales)

36:34.959 --> 36:36.458
I was wrong about you, Mickey.

36:38.792 --> 36:40.083
What?

36:40.166 --> 36:43.333
You are not a captain, Mickey.

36:43.417 --> 36:45.208
You are a sailor.

36:46.083 --> 36:49.583
You are only a sailor.

36:51.917 --> 36:54.291
I'm not a fuckin' sailor!

36:54.375 --> 36:57.333
Never said you fuckin' were.

36:57.417 --> 36:58.834
Did I?

37:07.875 --> 37:08.750
Sorry, Mick.

37:08.834 --> 37:11.959
(door slams)

37:12.041 --> 37:13.417
(chuckles)

37:25.041 --> 37:27.083
(panting)

37:27.166 --> 37:29.375
(taking deep breaths)

37:46.417 --> 37:48.750
(phone rings)

37:48.834 --> 37:50.000
Hello?

37:50.083 --> 37:53.125
I got a story for you.

37:53.208 --> 37:54.917
But it's gonna cost.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.208
I don't buy stories.

37:56.291 --> 37:57.875
All right, fuck it, then.

37:57.959 --> 37:59.834
You don't want to hear
how I was on the dock

37:59.917 --> 38:01.458
when Sully got shot?

38:05.000 --> 38:05.667
Hold on.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.834
Maybe we can work something out.

38:07.917 --> 38:10.250
Keep talking.
I'll need to speak
with you in person.

38:10.333 --> 38:11.375
Can you meet me?

38:11.458 --> 38:13.792
I got a little problem
with that, sweetheart.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.417
I can't leave where I'm at.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.375
Well, I know where you are;
I'll come to you.

38:19.291 --> 38:20.875
(quietly):
Okay.

38:20.959 --> 38:22.792
DONNA (over phone):
So, the head

38:22.875 --> 38:25.208
of the judiciary committee
is having dinner with us

38:25.291 --> 38:28.709
tomorrow night. (laughs)
Yeah.

38:28.792 --> 38:30.875
Next stop Washington, baby.

38:30.959 --> 38:31.875
(chuckles)

38:31.959 --> 38:34.834
Isn't that great?

38:34.917 --> 38:37.375
Yeah. That's, uh,
that's great news.

38:37.458 --> 38:39.208
What's wrong, sweetie?

38:39.291 --> 38:41.709
I'm just, uh...

38:41.792 --> 38:44.458
I'm trusting that somebody's
doing something for me,

38:44.542 --> 38:46.709
but, uh, I'm not sure
it's gonna get done.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.000
Mm.

38:49.083 --> 38:51.333
Well, as my mother
always told me,

38:51.417 --> 38:54.166
if you want something done,
you do it yourself.

39:00.083 --> 39:01.917
(laughs)

39:02.000 --> 39:04.667
Oh, that's why
I love you, Donna.

39:04.750 --> 39:06.000
(chuckles)

39:06.083 --> 39:08.792
(groans)

39:08.875 --> 39:10.750
(phone ringing)

39:11.875 --> 39:13.166
Yeah?

39:13.250 --> 39:16.750
I need to see you, right now.

39:20.917 --> 39:23.500
It's time.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.667
Keep walking.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.792
I don't want to go away
all by myself there.

39:38.875 --> 39:40.291
Get in the fucking
car, Tiny.

39:40.375 --> 39:42.375
I don't want to go.
I'll work for you.

39:42.458 --> 39:44.667
I... I can do
what Avi does--
I can help you.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.250
You're not gonna
work for me, Tiny.

39:46.333 --> 39:48.583
Ray... don't make me.

39:49.709 --> 39:52.000
You don't got a choice.

39:52.083 --> 39:54.208
You understand me?

40:00.709 --> 40:04.333
Cash in there to get you
started, and a passport.

40:08.583 --> 40:10.000
"Bert Handey"?

40:10.083 --> 40:12.291
That's you.
But I ain't Bert Handey.

40:12.375 --> 40:15.041
Aw, come on.
I'm Kenneth Benson.
I'm Tiny!

40:15.125 --> 40:17.041
I belong in Southie.
I just fuckin' came out here

40:17.125 --> 40:18.375
with Sully to do
a job for you.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.375
You're gonna get...
I ain't going!

40:20.458 --> 40:23.083
And you can't turn me
into Bert fuckin' Handey.

40:25.166 --> 40:27.959
You don't get it, do you?

40:28.041 --> 40:30.125
You don't got a
fuckin' choice.

40:30.208 --> 40:32.000
I do.

40:32.083 --> 40:34.208
I do, and I ain't goin'!

40:42.542 --> 40:43.667
Put him back inside.

40:46.208 --> 40:48.000
Come on.

40:58.083 --> 41:00.709
Remember when SpongeBob
got that jellyfish as a pet,

41:00.792 --> 41:02.500
and he put it on a leash?

41:02.583 --> 41:05.542
Yeah. Squidward hated
that jellyfish.

41:05.625 --> 41:07.417
(imitates Squidward):
I wouldn't let that
thing in my house

41:07.500 --> 41:09.458
even if it was
potty trained.

41:09.542 --> 41:11.375
(laughter)

41:11.458 --> 41:13.834
Uh, I'm gonna get a beer.
You want a beer?

41:13.917 --> 41:14.917
It's on me.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.333
I don't drink no more.

41:16.417 --> 41:18.000
Got it.

41:18.083 --> 41:19.875
I'll have a Coke.

41:19.959 --> 41:21.208
I want a Coke, too.

41:21.291 --> 41:24.500
Oh, just... one, please. Thanks.

41:36.375 --> 41:39.583
So, uh, how did you... how'd
you learn how to build a bike?

41:42.125 --> 41:44.750
(exhales):
Um...

41:44.834 --> 41:48.250
I got a... hand-me-down bike
from my brother,

41:48.333 --> 41:49.500
uh, but it got stolen.

41:49.583 --> 41:52.041
My parents couldn't
afford a new one,

41:52.125 --> 41:54.917
so...

41:55.000 --> 41:58.125
I had to build my own.

42:00.125 --> 42:02.000
No one's gonna steal
your bike, all right?

42:02.083 --> 42:04.625
I promise.

42:04.709 --> 42:08.417
And if they do, they're
gonna have to answer to me.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.709
(giggles)

42:15.000 --> 42:17.208
(vehicle approaching)

42:28.750 --> 42:30.375
Our friend in
the motel room.

42:30.458 --> 42:32.375
I'm taking care of it.

42:32.458 --> 42:35.959
Everything you tell me
is a lie, Ray. Everything.

42:36.041 --> 42:38.166
MICKEY (recorded):
I got a story for you.

42:38.250 --> 42:39.583
But it's gonna cost.

42:39.667 --> 42:40.417
KATE:
I don't buy stories.

42:40.500 --> 42:42.917
MICKEY:
All right, fuck it, then.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.709
You don't want to hear
how I was on the dock

42:45.792 --> 42:49.041
when Sully got shot?

42:49.125 --> 42:50.583
You don't have anything
under control, do you?

42:50.667 --> 42:53.542
Not your father,
not that reporter,

42:53.625 --> 42:55.250
not the fat fuck
in the motel room.

42:55.333 --> 42:56.458
You won't hear from him again.

42:56.542 --> 42:58.125
It's too late for
your plan, Ray.

42:58.208 --> 43:00.375
Don't... don't do it.

43:00.458 --> 43:02.125
Do what?
Don't kill him.

43:02.208 --> 43:04.125
Who said anything
about killing anybody?

43:04.208 --> 43:07.208
Wha... (scoffs)

43:07.291 --> 43:09.333
I got a man on him.

43:09.417 --> 43:10.500
He's not gonna let
anything happen.

43:10.583 --> 43:13.083
You have an ex-Mossad agent
who spends his nights

43:13.166 --> 43:14.625
watching television
with his mother.

43:14.709 --> 43:18.458

43:26.834 --> 43:28.500

43:29.792 --> 43:33.291
Congratulations-- you're
moving to Trousdale!

We got the house.
That's right.

43:45.625 --> 43:46.333
When were you gonna tell me?

43:46.417 --> 43:49.333
I wanted to tell you in person.

43:49.417 --> 43:52.375
Well, I know now,
'cause Deb's here.

43:52.458 --> 43:54.375
She brought champagne.

43:54.458 --> 43:56.500
She thought you'd
be here, too.

43:56.583 --> 43:59.542
I'm glad you're happy.

43:59.625 --> 44:00.875
When are you coming home?

44:04.166 --> 44:05.333
Soon as I can.

44:05.417 --> 44:08.291
Okay then, Ray.

44:25.625 --> 44:28.458
Go home. I'm
taking over.

44:28.542 --> 44:30.500
What do you mean,
you're taking over?

44:30.583 --> 44:33.500
I mean I'm taking
over. Go home, Av.

44:39.417 --> 44:42.417

45:06.417 --> 45:07.333
Oh, I don't want
to get sick, Ray.

45:07.417 --> 45:10.333
Go ahead, you'll be fine.

45:11.542 --> 45:14.375
So do I get to work
with you, Ray?

45:14.458 --> 45:16.542
Sure.

45:17.667 --> 45:20.417
I just couldn't
go to that place, Ray.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.333
I get it.

45:21.417 --> 45:23.166
I wouldn't want to
leave home, either.

45:23.250 --> 45:24.959
Mm.

45:25.041 --> 45:27.792
I'm just a simple person.
I like what I like.

45:28.875 --> 45:31.291
I know you are, Tiny.

45:31.375 --> 45:34.333
Mmm. I'd like
some ice cream.

45:43.083 --> 45:44.500
I'll go get you some.

45:44.583 --> 45:46.458
