SUE AIKENS: So I got caribou
out there.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.367
They're walking towards
the river to bail. Oh, man.

00:20.567 --> 00:22.400
The snow is too deep
for me to walk.

00:22.467 --> 00:25.600
It's too much for me to crawl
down the runway. I'll freeze
before I get there.

00:28.267 --> 00:30.167
I need my hunting licence
and paperwork.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.100
Spare bullets here,
we all know I need
lots of those.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.333
Gun.

00:35.067 --> 00:38.067
The last thing I need are
my shooting sticks. I'll grab
that out the door.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.467
I don't wanna get a female.
I do wanna get meat.

00:44.533 --> 00:46.033
Let me be successful.

01:18.033 --> 01:20.833
I do have some ptarmigan
in my freezie now.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.600
But it'd be nice
to add a caribou.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.633
NARRATOR: Sue Aikens
is on the hunt for caribou,

01:25.700 --> 01:27.833
a key food source
for the coming spring.

01:28.300 --> 01:31.333
But the animals are only
available as they migrate
through the area,

01:32.067 --> 01:35.567
and an early herd is
an opportunity she can't
afford to waste.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.000
They've already made me.
They're looking right over.

01:41.633 --> 01:42.833
Damn it.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.633
With my personal
code of ethics,

01:45.967 --> 01:48.267
I don't want to get
a pregnant cow.

01:48.333 --> 01:50.567
I want to see the dangly bits.

01:51.100 --> 01:54.400
There's no way for me
to judge boys and girls
from this side.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.233
Fuck! Okay.

02:09.133 --> 02:10.433
Damn it.

02:23.733 --> 02:25.400
It's just too far.

02:25.867 --> 02:29.800
Took aim at one of the boys
and the women get around
and huddle up against him.

02:30.033 --> 02:31.567
It's a survival thing.

02:33.433 --> 02:35.000
And that's the end
of this hunt.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.800
I don't believe I even came
close to hitting one.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.800
So, back to camp I go.

meets opportunity,
gives you good luck.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.567

03:24.967 --> 03:26.767
The cache is still standing.

03:28.533 --> 03:31.200
NARRATOR: Last summer,
the Hailstones built a cache

03:31.333 --> 03:33.333
at the remote hunting
grounds in Kiwalik.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.533
The structure is vital
to their nomadic lifestyle.

03:36.600 --> 03:41.367
It allows the family to store
their wood, gas, and shelter
for long periods of time.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Chip and Agnes have returned
to their cache to set up camp.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.967
Over the next several weeks,

03:48.033 --> 03:49.667
the family
will use it as a base

03:49.733 --> 03:53.667
to stockpile meat, fur,
and other resources
for the coming spring.

03:55.667 --> 03:58.000
CHIP: Look like our tent spot
right here, huh?

03:58.200 --> 04:00.200
Doesn't feel bumpy
or lumpy too bad.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.633
-Look. Try with
your heel. It's good.
-Yep.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.167

much daylight,

04:07.267 --> 04:09.500
so if we're gonna do this,
let's do it soon.

04:09.567 --> 04:13.933
AGNES: Some time to, uh,
dig out our tent, dig out our
floors, try and put it up,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.800
and, um, try to get ourselves
set up for the night.

here is now.

04:35.433 --> 04:38.833
We hunt caribou, maybe
a little bit of trapping,
get a little bit of fur.

04:40.933 --> 04:42.000
Ah! There it is.

04:42.633 --> 04:44.833
First, though,
is getting the tent up.

04:47.467 --> 04:51.067

our stuff but it's nice to
have 'em here waiting for us.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.133

just take time.

What's the point of rushing
forward for a moment
that isn't even here yet?

07:14.567 --> 07:15.767
I'm going out on the lake now.

07:15.833 --> 07:17.667
I gotta open up
the water hole.

07:17.733 --> 07:19.833
Every three or four days,
I have to open up the hole
I've got through the ice.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.767
Get water out, bring it into
the cabin in buckets,

07:22.833 --> 07:25.700

my hot water pan on the stove.

Hey! Oh, look at this.

07:33.467 --> 07:36.000
Wolves came out here
and pissed right beside
my water hole.

07:38.100 --> 07:42.500
Wolf tracks.
Those are the claws,
toes, the heel pad.

07:42.967 --> 07:45.900
There's a lot of wolves around
right now, and that means
there's caribou around.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.033
Caribou on the lake!

07:54.500 --> 07:56.133
I can use another
caribou right now.

08:01.700 --> 08:04.033
This time of year,
the days are short.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.133
It doesn't stay light
very long.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.867
When I see caribou,
I gotta go.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.833
This is how it usually goes.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.567
I'll be out doing jobs,
just keeping my eyes open,

08:17.633 --> 08:20.800
and sooner or later,
an opportunity comes up.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.600
I gotta go over there and
see if I can get close enough
to get a shot.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.633
I don't wanna head out
on the open lake and
try to run 'em down

08:43.700 --> 08:45.100
or chase 'em around out there.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.667
I wanna sneak through
the woods around the side.

08:47.867 --> 08:50.067
I'm gonna try and intercept
'em over on this end
of the lake.

08:50.533 --> 08:51.900
They definitely saw me.

08:51.967 --> 08:54.400
Caribou are
very unpredictable,
but sometimes,

08:55.067 --> 08:57.033
when they see some
movement and they're
not sure what it is,

08:58.167 --> 08:59.900
they'll actually come closer
to check it out,

08:59.967 --> 09:01.100
see if it's danger.

09:04.267 --> 09:05.733
Look at this.

09:06.100 --> 09:09.633
This is where caribou have
been feeding. These craters,
they're making 'em.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.700
The caribou crater
down through the snow.

09:11.767 --> 09:13.600
They have to dig down
to get to the lichen.

09:13.867 --> 09:15.067
That's caribou food.

09:15.767 --> 09:19.733
Caribou eat this and
turn it into meat and
fat that I can eat.

09:25.567 --> 09:27.267
These are wolf tracks.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.400
These wolves are hunting
caribou every single day.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.433
(WHISPERING)
I'm getting closer. They're
about a quarter-mile away.

09:40.333 --> 09:43.433
But I gotta get about half
that distance before I shoot.

09:43.933 --> 09:46.700
I'm gonna take off
my snowshoes here
so I'm quieter.

09:54.300 --> 09:55.733
(WHISPERING)

09:57.200 --> 10:00.067
I'm gonna sit here for a while
and see if anything changes.

10:04.133 --> 10:05.167
No.

10:05.733 --> 10:06.800
They're too far,

10:06.867 --> 10:08.500
so I'm not gonna
take that shot.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.233
There are a lot
of caribou around.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.200
I'm gonna wait
for a better shot.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.867
Right there, these caribou
are going behind the island.

10:19.933 --> 10:21.433
They're gonna have to
come out the other side.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.433
I might be able to use
the island to hide myself

10:25.100 --> 10:26.767
and intercept 'em
on the other side.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
When the caribou are here,
I gotta take advantage of
that opportunity

10:30.067 --> 10:32.367
because they can be here
one day and gone the next.

10:36.733 --> 10:38.667
ANDY BASSICH: Every day
is kind of an adventure
out here.

10:38.733 --> 10:41.867
Every day you see
new things in nature
if you pay attention to it.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.100
You wanna go get some wood?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.233
Who wants to go get wood?
Just a short run.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.467
I woke up this morning,
it was about 30 below zero.

11:01.533 --> 11:03.967
Went out to my power shack
and I got no wood.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.767
I like getting firewood
with the dogs as
much as possible,

11:07.833 --> 11:09.533
especially when
it's colder out.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.633
The machines are a pain
in the butt to deal with.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.667
Dogs are always reliable.

11:13.933 --> 11:15.733
It's good exercise
for the dogs

11:15.800 --> 11:17.733
and I just like the dogs
better than the machines.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.467
It's just way, way more fun
with the dogs.

11:22.233 --> 11:26.200

Gee, gee, gee, gee!

11:27.233 --> 11:31.267

Hup, let's go, hup, hup, hup.

11:35.267 --> 11:36.767
Ho! Ho!

11:37.433 --> 11:39.133
It's either cut wood
or go get a job,

11:39.700 --> 11:41.133
make money, and buy oil.

11:41.833 --> 11:43.400
I'd much rather go cut wood.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.700
Well, this tree's leaning
definitely the wrong way,

11:47.767 --> 11:50.467
but at least I don't have to
worry about it dropping
on the dogs.

11:51.367 --> 11:52.667
(WHIRRING)

11:59.167 --> 12:00.533
Well, that kind of sucks.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.100
When trees are leaning,
they can only go
one direction,

12:03.167 --> 12:05.567
so you're at the mercy
of the lean of the tree.

12:16.867 --> 12:19.100
(SPEAKING)

12:19.500 --> 12:22.233
Trees hang up,
uh, sometimes
multiple times.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.000
And, um, it makes for
a lot more work.

12:27.533 --> 12:28.800
(LAUGHS)

12:29.667 --> 12:30.767
Whoo-hoo!

12:30.833 --> 12:32.400
(SPEAKING)

12:32.600 --> 12:34.233
I dropped, I think,
four trees,

12:34.300 --> 12:37.300
just to try and get it
to where I could cut it
up for firewood.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.467
I'll get back in there
and stumble around,

12:39.533 --> 12:41.567
and try and get the rest
of the wood another day.

12:45.433 --> 12:46.633
(STRAINING)

12:48.300 --> 12:51.933
Hundred and fifty, 100 pounds,
150 pounds, it's not too bad.

12:53.267 --> 12:55.667
This'll be enough wood
for probably five days.

13:04.567 --> 13:07.067
On your feet!
On your feet!
Hup, hup!

13:09.267 --> 13:11.500
Ho, ho. Whoa, whoa! Perfect.

to the max.

for me. I didn't wanna have
to walk home. (LAUGHING)

hunting caribou
as they migrate

through the Brooks Range
is key to his survival.

With a small herd making
its way across the lake,

15:02.800 --> 15:07.033
he must sneak along the
perimeter to cut off his prey
and get into firing range.

15:11.833 --> 15:13.767
GLENN: I have to do things
that are gonna confuse 'em.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.700
First, I just walk
parallel to 'em,

15:16.000 --> 15:19.233
closing the distance a little
bit at a time, but not going
straight at 'em.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.500
(WHISPERING) I wanna get
a little closer if I can.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.100
(YELLING)

15:23.433 --> 15:25.800
Starting to yell,
that confuses 'em,

15:25.867 --> 15:27.933
because my voice
is echoing off the shoreline.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.133
When they got behind
this little island right here,

15:30.200 --> 15:31.900
I yelled really loud
when I couldn't see 'em,

15:31.967 --> 15:34.867
hoping that the echo
off the far shoreline
would chase 'em back around.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.833
(YELLING)

15:43.133 --> 15:44.500
(WHISPERING) God,
they don't look that far.

15:44.767 --> 15:45.833
(YELLING)

16:00.767 --> 16:02.200
(SPEAKING)

16:02.633 --> 16:04.800
I decided not to shoot,

16:04.867 --> 16:07.367
because I just can't tell
which one is
the mother for sure,

16:07.433 --> 16:08.833
and I don't wanna
orphan that calf.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.933
It'd definitely die if it was
on its own this time of year.

16:11.067 --> 16:14.333
I'm just gonna keep looking.
Sooner or later, the right
opportunity will come up.

16:23.767 --> 16:25.833
SUE: You must develop,
in your life,

16:25.900 --> 16:28.267
a line in the sand
that doesn't get crossed.

16:37.867 --> 16:40.267
There they are.
Little bastards.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.667
Kavik Valley is known
for the, uh, feed.

16:43.733 --> 16:47.033
The type of lichen
that we have here is the kind
that really adds the fat on.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.900
This is an opportunity
too good to pass up.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.967
Here they are again.
'Bout two, three miles down.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.267
Time is of the essence.

17:09.367 --> 17:12.267
(SPEAKING)

17:14.733 --> 17:16.467
You do not see me.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.133
I'm not coming your way.

17:23.033 --> 17:26.300
(SPEAKING)

17:26.367 --> 17:27.800
We can try to get close.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
(GUNSHOT)

17:48.333 --> 17:50.467
God. Fuckin' stop, will ya?

17:50.533 --> 17:51.533
(GUNSHOT)

17:51.933 --> 17:52.933
(GUNSHOT)

17:54.533 --> 17:56.667
I took a few shots
on the left.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.900
Way uncomfortable,
way unsteady.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.600
I took that shot
at that caribou
down by the river.

18:06.267 --> 18:07.933
Busted the bone
into four pieces.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.300
I take shots
and I'm flinchin'.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.767
I'm gonna see
if I can't walk
up a little bit.

18:18.167 --> 18:20.467
I'm gonna be out of bullets.
I got two more left.

18:22.233 --> 18:23.567
(PANTING)

18:28.800 --> 18:29.800
(GUNSHOT)

18:30.333 --> 18:32.500
We got an injured one,
so we gotta go.

18:32.867 --> 18:34.733
It's that one
on the far right.

18:37.567 --> 18:40.867
He can still go pretty far.
He's got an injured leg.

18:42.767 --> 18:44.633
Shit. Stop, dude.

18:52.500 --> 18:56.300
I took a close-range
head shot just to put it
out of its misery.

18:57.833 --> 19:01.367
I'm gonna go back,
get the sled, and, uh,
get him on it.

19:01.633 --> 19:03.633
Before it freezes up too hard.

19:03.967 --> 19:05.800
Been chasing these suckers
for a while.

19:06.167 --> 19:08.500
Changed it up today,
almost gave up,

19:08.567 --> 19:12.100
and decided
I'd just try that
one last time.

19:12.167 --> 19:14.300
Uh, it was actually a hell
of a distance shot.

19:14.433 --> 19:19.267
I am proud of myself.
It may have taken me
a store's worth of bullets

19:19.333 --> 19:22.367
to get the animal down,
but go me.

19:22.433 --> 19:24.833
Wintertime meat.
Almost unheard of.

19:28.067 --> 19:31.300
CHIP: I've always enjoyed
the hunt. It's a good way
to provide for your family

19:31.367 --> 19:32.567
and to enrichen your life.

19:42.567 --> 19:45.733
I'm gonna take an axe with me
and go get some firewood.

19:45.800 --> 19:50.800
I like to go down to the beach
and go get, uh, driftwood
that's blown clear and dry.

19:50.867 --> 19:52.967
I'm gonna go over here
to a place called
Spafarief Hill.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.533
At the base of that
is the ocean.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.333
And there's a lot
of driftwood over there.

19:56.533 --> 19:59.733
And a lot of it's really dry
and a lot of it's already
busted up.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.233
-I love you.
-Love you, too. See you later.

20:17.567 --> 20:19.500
There's a bunch of
female caribou over here.

20:24.833 --> 20:26.967
I didn't wanna spook 'em.

20:27.033 --> 20:29.133
They're about a good
500 yards away.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.067
There's a lot of females
with babies.

20:33.200 --> 20:37.700
So if I wanted caribou,
I could be caribou rich
right now, but I already am.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.767
So, the chore right now
is for firewood.

20:45.867 --> 20:49.900
When we left here this fall,
we left all this wood here.

20:50.833 --> 20:55.633
So I just wanna get
a nice pile, so, uh,

20:55.700 --> 20:58.033
I can burn wood
while Chip's gone,

20:58.100 --> 21:00.667
and if for some reason
he gets back kind of late,

21:01.067 --> 21:05.100
he doesn't have to worry
about sawing all the wood
he brought home,

21:05.167 --> 21:07.000
and, you know,
getting it all chopped down.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.333
Now that we have the wood
thrown in the tepee,

21:19.400 --> 21:25.067
most important chore,
I'm gonna walk to the river
and go get some ice.

21:26.867 --> 21:30.800
What I do is I pretty much
just go out and go find
a big crack

21:30.867 --> 21:33.700
or a lot of cracks
joined like that,

21:33.767 --> 21:37.367
and, of course, you can see
the ground under there. You
can actually see the bottom.

21:37.867 --> 21:39.667
That's real good
drinking water.

21:40.267 --> 21:41.833
Just start chipping
away and...

21:50.800 --> 21:52.500
It's real easy.

21:52.567 --> 21:55.200
See how clear it is?
It's good water.

22:08.933 --> 22:11.467
We take it day by day.
You know, we plan ahead,

22:11.933 --> 22:13.533
we think of the next season,

22:13.600 --> 22:16.100
we think of
the other opportunities
that are heading our way,

22:16.167 --> 22:18.500
and we try to put
all that together.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.467
So this should last us
a couple, few days.

22:21.667 --> 22:26.600
So I'm just gonna go bring
this ice to the, um, tent.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.733
Then I'll have my water
and my heat.

22:35.367 --> 22:39.100
CHIP: It's always a good sign
when there's tracks, there's
caribou, there's ptarmigan.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.933
But, uh, I gotta make my way
over to the wood, too.

22:42.033 --> 22:43.867
That's more important
than anything else.

22:51.100 --> 22:53.300
I got some dry wood.

22:53.400 --> 22:57.300
This last, uh, summer, when we
were down here getting wood,

22:57.367 --> 22:59.167
I left a little tripod
pile of wood.

22:59.233 --> 23:01.900
I see it's mostly
knocked down,
probably by the waves,

23:01.967 --> 23:03.433
but it's sticking up.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.800
And the trick is that it's
not frozen to the ground.

23:05.867 --> 23:09.867
It's sticking up and it's dry,
so, I got a couple of good dry
pieces of wood to take home.

23:11.100 --> 23:14.333
It's probably, one log is
probably two good days
of firewood.

23:18.100 --> 23:20.100
Yeah, it's dry, all right!

23:21.100 --> 23:23.633
This is the Arctic,
and the thing is you
gotta keep warm.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.100
You gotta keep dry.
That's really how it works.

23:30.467 --> 23:31.700
-Shucks.
-(AXE CRACKS)

23:31.767 --> 23:32.933
Oh, man!

23:34.067 --> 23:37.000
Brand new axe, gone to shit.

23:40.100 --> 23:41.300
Bummer.

23:43.333 --> 23:46.700
I just bought this axe
for 40 bucks at the store
before we left.

23:47.933 --> 23:49.233
I didn't wanna take
the home axe,

23:49.300 --> 23:50.800
'cause we heat
with wood at home,

23:50.900 --> 23:53.967
and leave the girls
with no axe.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.333
I could throw a fit, I guess.
Cuss.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.733
Bitch.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.133
But that's not me.

23:59.667 --> 24:02.367
I think I'll just, uh,
tie down the whole log.

24:03.033 --> 24:08.033
I've got, uh, two miles to
the lagoon, five miles home,
so seven-mile drag.

24:08.667 --> 24:09.733
Won't be too bad.

24:10.733 --> 24:11.900
But I have to get wood.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.333
(STRAINING)

24:22.867 --> 24:24.333
Right there.

24:29.433 --> 24:32.800
Sometimes the roots are frozen
into the sand and you can't
go anywhere.

24:40.867 --> 24:42.700
I'm gonna get this tied up.

24:42.767 --> 24:44.867
I'll go back to camp,

24:44.933 --> 24:46.800
find me a cup
of coffee or two.

24:47.233 --> 24:50.300
That gas was expensive,
my time isn't free.

24:50.367 --> 24:52.800
Despite that, I'd rather spend
two gallons of gas

24:52.867 --> 24:54.833
than burn five gallons
of stove oil tonight.

24:58.767 --> 25:01.033
I also get to breathe
fresh air, see some animals.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.700
I've seen so many tracks.
I've probably seen
a couple hundred caribou.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.867
This place is alive.
It's really good to be here.

25:20.433 --> 25:23.800
Those are some nice,
dry-looking, long logs.

25:23.867 --> 25:27.133
Yeah, I broke the axe.
Whack, whack, whack,
whack, whack, pow.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.667
It broke, like, instantly.
No good axe.

25:30.533 --> 25:32.367
We'll have to use
the bigger axe, I guess, here.

25:32.767 --> 25:34.167
So however it works, I guess.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.967
Man, you know that if
you wanna see caribou,

25:36.033 --> 25:38.400
I saw about 200 that just
crossed the Kiwalik,

25:38.933 --> 25:42.533
and then up on those hills
there was a big, long line
that came up towards us.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.533
-AGNES: Wow, all over,
just here and there?
-All over.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.433
Caribou are scattered
'cause the feed up there,

25:46.500 --> 25:48.333
when you get up
on these hills,
the feed is everywhere.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.633
So they're not even
bunched up,
they're just scattered.

25:50.700 --> 25:52.233
AGNES: Wow.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.833
We have plenty of firewood.
I dug out all the firewood
we left.

25:54.900 --> 25:56.467
-Oh, the split stuff?
-Yeah, the split stuff.

25:56.533 --> 25:57.933
-So we don't gotta
saw this right now?
-Nope.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.967
-We have it all inside and...
-Oh, excellent.

26:00.033 --> 26:04.333
We... I went and got ice,
and brought it in
and melted some.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.367
-It's warm.
-Excellent.

26:06.567 --> 26:08.500
AGNES: And you can see.
(GIGGLES)

26:12.133 --> 26:14.867
SUE: You don't ever know
what Mother Nature's gonna
throw at you.

26:14.933 --> 26:17.533
You're at the top end
of extreme for conditions.

26:28.467 --> 26:29.533
Here she is.

26:32.033 --> 26:33.133
Phew.

26:33.900 --> 26:38.000
Damn cold. Temp is dropping
fast and hard.

26:38.767 --> 26:43.633
But I'm just gonna try to get
a real quick gut job done,
then bring this joker home.

26:46.533 --> 26:50.400
Been a while since
I've had to do one in
the wintertime here.

26:50.967 --> 26:52.633
This is not common.

26:53.167 --> 26:57.367
These guys are not supposed
to be back here for a couple
of months yet.

27:01.033 --> 27:02.067
Argh!

27:02.233 --> 27:03.233
Okay.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.100
Well, that ain't gonna
fucking work.

27:09.233 --> 27:11.100
Yeah, I don't know if
I'm gonna be able to...

27:11.767 --> 27:12.967
This is all frozen.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.867
(PANTING)

27:22.967 --> 27:24.500
My hands are freezing
to the knife.

27:30.700 --> 27:31.700
(EXHALES ANGRILY)

27:32.167 --> 27:33.633
I'm freezing to the knife.

27:36.167 --> 27:37.767
My hand is freezing
to the knife,

27:37.833 --> 27:40.000
the blood is freezing
to the knife, the fat is
freezing to the knife.

27:42.733 --> 27:44.167
Come on. (PANTING)

27:45.500 --> 27:46.667
There.

27:53.933 --> 27:55.033
My hands are so frozen.

27:55.700 --> 27:57.667
Fuck. Okay.

28:01.300 --> 28:02.300
(WINCING)

28:07.400 --> 28:08.700
Damn it!

28:09.533 --> 28:10.867
I'm in trouble.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.700
I don't know how much more
I can handle on my fingers.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.100
Ah, fuck it.

28:33.633 --> 28:38.933
I owe it to this animal,
this beautiful girl, to make
the most out of her life.

28:52.200 --> 28:53.400
Argh!

28:54.800 --> 28:55.900
Whew.

28:57.233 --> 28:58.900
This is the heart.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.800
Whew, all right.

29:03.933 --> 29:05.100
Boink.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.133
One saving grace,
I was going for the boy.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.733
This one got hit,
got a spine shot.

29:16.067 --> 29:18.867
Uh, at that point,
this is the one I have
to take down.

29:19.033 --> 29:20.433
It's not a pregnant female.

29:20.967 --> 29:23.200
So, thank the
good lord on that.

29:23.533 --> 29:26.033
I just, I would probably
have to give up hunting.

29:26.100 --> 29:27.633
'Cause I don't know how
I would've handled that.

29:29.167 --> 29:30.500
Last piece.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.233
Okay.

29:33.900 --> 29:35.367
For a winter kill,

29:35.900 --> 29:38.700
wind chill factor's around
50 below zero,

29:38.767 --> 29:41.167
I got a lot of good meat.

29:41.233 --> 29:44.467
I feel proud of myself,
but mostly,

29:44.533 --> 29:47.900
the only thing I'm feeling
right now is freaking cold.

29:50.233 --> 29:53.700
But, uh, you don't even know
how grateful I am.

29:59.033 --> 30:01.833
ANDY: It takes a lot of
self-motivation to live
out in the bush.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.400
Uh, you've gotta be able
to push yourself.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.800
NARRATOR: Andy and his
dog team are returning home
with a sled load of firewood.

30:12.867 --> 30:15.367
Mushing with the dogs
is critical to their training,

30:15.433 --> 30:17.833
but the Yukon River ice
is treacherous,

30:17.900 --> 30:20.300
and he must be cautious
to avoid sled damage,

30:20.367 --> 30:23.067
or serious injury
to himself or the dogs.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.567
I like using the dogs. Uh,
it's good exercise for them.

30:27.133 --> 30:32.233
The dogs are quick, reliable,
and, uh, they do the job.
Plus, they have fun.

30:32.433 --> 30:34.267
Attaboy. Good boy.

30:36.433 --> 30:39.733
You don't put the time in
with the training, you don't
get much out of 'em.

30:39.967 --> 30:43.100
It's not just physical
conditioning training
that's important,

30:43.167 --> 30:48.200
there's a lot of training
that goes into discipline,
behavioural issues.

30:48.500 --> 30:51.633
If your dogs behave well,
then you take 'em everywhere
and you do more with 'em.

30:51.700 --> 30:53.367
If they're always
misbehaving, then,

30:53.433 --> 30:55.933
it defeats the purpose
to take 'em into the bush
with you.

30:57.067 --> 30:58.533
Easy, easy, easy.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.167
Easy. Settle down, you guys.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.033
Holy shit.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.567
Easy, easy, easy.

31:11.267 --> 31:12.967
Oh! Shit.

31:23.100 --> 31:26.167
Cruising top speed across
the Yukon River jumble ice,

31:26.267 --> 31:29.533
the sled started running
sideways, and I couldn't
control it.

31:29.600 --> 31:33.167
I felt the sled starting
to give way on me,
so I just let go.

31:33.467 --> 31:36.100
Bailed because I was afraid
I was gonna fall off.

31:36.167 --> 31:38.100
The sled continued on
with the dogs.

31:38.167 --> 31:39.800
It was crashing and banging,

31:39.867 --> 31:42.733
and eventually it slammed
into a chunk of ice,
flipped over.

31:44.033 --> 31:46.400
Anybody here get hurt?
You guys okay?

31:47.167 --> 31:50.067
You was just going
like the wind!
Holy crap, man!

31:52.400 --> 31:53.733
Holy shit.

31:54.067 --> 31:57.567
Plastic shouldn't do that,
but it looks like it's,

31:57.667 --> 31:59.533
it's just getting kind of old
and brittle.

31:59.900 --> 32:02.000
I don't know if I can
get this home like this.

32:02.133 --> 32:04.500
I'm gonna just unload
the sled here,

32:04.567 --> 32:09.367
maybe take one log for my fire
and then lighten the load up
and try and get it home.

32:09.567 --> 32:11.300
(GROANS) Stay!

32:12.167 --> 32:14.867
I don't wanna come home
empty-handed, 'cause I'm
out of wood.

32:15.200 --> 32:20.633
A fast, easy wood trip's
turning into a bit of
an ordeal here.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.667
Man, lost my sled twice today.
(LAUGHING)

32:24.133 --> 32:27.100
Man! I don't think I ever seen
one blow apart like that.

32:27.967 --> 32:31.833
All right, easy,
you guys, easy.
Gambo, easy, man, easy.

32:35.433 --> 32:37.933
That wasn't too bad.
The sled didn't come
to an abrupt stop,

32:38.133 --> 32:41.733
but I've had 'em crash
before where it comes
to an abrupt stop

32:42.067 --> 32:44.767
and I've had dogs rip
right out of their
harnesses before.

32:45.900 --> 32:47.667
And that's not good
for the dog.

32:48.033 --> 32:51.967
Good boys. Haw, haw. Haw, haw.
Haw, haw. Haw, haw.

32:53.500 --> 32:57.100
What a mess! When I came
down the hill, I heard
something pop.

32:57.467 --> 32:59.233
I knew the sled wasn't
handling right,

32:59.300 --> 33:02.267
so I just decided,
let go, get the heck
away from it,

33:02.367 --> 33:05.567
'cause the last thing
you wanna do is fall
on that hard ice out there.

33:05.633 --> 33:07.167
That's how you really
get messed up.

33:07.567 --> 33:11.267
I'd rather just let go.
I can rebuild a sled,
I can't rebuild an Andy.

33:12.067 --> 33:13.800
Something good came of it.

33:13.867 --> 33:17.067
Got a couple pieces of wood
for my fire. That'll get me
couple of hours.

33:17.133 --> 33:20.867
Uh, I don't know,
I'm gonna have to bring
this into my shop

33:21.700 --> 33:26.367
and really go over it,
but I mean, it's...
It's smucked.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.967
I mean, it's gone.
Look at that.

33:30.867 --> 33:34.233
It's pretty much toast.
This is a total rebuild.

33:34.767 --> 33:38.433
Well, I guess the quicker
I can get the dogs put up
and get it in my shop,

33:38.500 --> 33:41.767
thaw it out and start tearing
it down, the quicker I can

33:41.867 --> 33:43.733
get back on the trail,
go get my wood.

33:44.933 --> 33:47.467
All right, you guys did
a good job. That was me.

33:48.067 --> 33:50.633
I'm the one who screwed that.
I'm the dumbass today.

33:50.967 --> 33:55.133
Today, you were a good anchor.
I saw you stop everybody.
You're such a good boy!

33:58.433 --> 34:00.333
CHIP: In the way that my wife
was raised up,

34:00.800 --> 34:02.600
she kind of takes care
of the warm places.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.467
I kinda deal
with the cold places.

34:12.633 --> 34:14.167
I'm gonna go get some
more firewood.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.367
There's a log right over here
I'm gonna go to.

34:16.867 --> 34:18.400
It was there this summer,

34:18.467 --> 34:19.800
and I flipped it up to
make sure it would
dry out really well.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.233
So before I run out of heat,
take this tired-ass chainsaw

34:23.767 --> 34:25.900
and walk over there
and chop it up.

34:26.767 --> 34:27.867
Oh, heat is important.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.333
Heat dries everything,
cooks everything,

34:30.400 --> 34:34.767
lets the body bathe
in warm water,
drink hot stuff, eat.

34:35.133 --> 34:36.300
It's life.

34:39.533 --> 34:41.533
A good river will
give you everything.

34:41.767 --> 34:44.700
Some good drinking water,
fish in the right seasons,

34:45.067 --> 34:46.867
and firewood.
It comes from upriver.

34:47.300 --> 34:48.633
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

34:54.167 --> 34:56.500
Well, with the wood I got
yesterday that hasn't been
burned yet,

34:56.600 --> 35:00.933
and this wood right here,
I'd have a couple, four, five
days' worth of wood, I think.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.033
Well, this will be good
for setting up camp for now.

35:03.100 --> 35:06.033
But I am gonna have to
go get more wood.
It is a constant chore.

35:06.433 --> 35:07.933
It's like going to the river
and getting ice.

35:08.700 --> 35:10.100
It's like going to
the bathroom.

35:10.667 --> 35:13.600
These are just cycles
we're always attentive to.

35:14.033 --> 35:18.100
And when I start to get low
on wood, I don't run out
of wood. I go get more.

35:18.167 --> 35:19.633
That's just the trick
to it all.

35:25.467 --> 35:27.000
I call it wood reduction.

35:27.533 --> 35:32.200
I reduced it from being
a tree over there on the bank,
to chunks of wood.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.967
I brought it here,
I sawed it up into
other pieces.

35:37.033 --> 35:39.800
And now I'm gonna bust it up
with the axe
so it'll fit inside my stove.

35:40.100 --> 35:41.767
Eventually, this will
all be ash.

35:50.333 --> 35:52.600
I got about two fires here,
two fires there.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.233
Something to start us
in the morning,

35:55.300 --> 35:58.267
finish up at night,
start in the morning,
finish at night.

35:59.867 --> 36:01.267
It's a never-ending chore.

36:04.567 --> 36:07.233
-You want some tea?
-Yeah. Tea would be awesome.

36:10.833 --> 36:12.200
AGNES: Nice and warm, eh?

36:12.267 --> 36:15.133
Yeah. Here, I'll add some more
wood to the fire real quick.

36:18.433 --> 36:20.767
My chores are done.
I got them logs and I got
the wood split up.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.833
I went out and chopped
some ice, and
just stacked it up for later.

36:24.900 --> 36:26.933
-Cool.
-Tent is up.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.100
Tent is up and happy.
Our chores are done
and it's time to hunt.

36:35.233 --> 36:37.000
GLENN: Gotta take advantage
of opportunities as they come.

36:37.067 --> 36:38.833
I never know
what today's gonna bring.

36:51.933 --> 36:55.533
When I'm hunting caribou,
I follow my instincts.
I follow my feelings.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.867
I've spent a lot of time
around caribou out here,

36:57.967 --> 37:00.233
and I don't necessarily
plan it out.

37:00.367 --> 37:02.433
I'm looking for a big caribou.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.600
Either a cow without a calf,
or a bull.

37:05.433 --> 37:09.200
Patience is something
that is in short supply
in the world today.

37:09.267 --> 37:11.467
In modern society,
everything's so rushed.

37:11.733 --> 37:15.233
Hunting takes
a great deal of patience,
the way I practise it.

37:15.367 --> 37:18.067
I'm never in a rush.
There's no, there's no need.

37:18.267 --> 37:21.833
Give it time,
and sooner or later,
the moment will come.

37:22.067 --> 37:23.467
It's a long winter.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.733
I only need
five or six caribou.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.800
I don't have a two-week
hunting season.

37:27.867 --> 37:30.733
I'm not out for a weekend,
recreational hunt.

37:30.967 --> 37:32.433
This is my lifestyle.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.533
I can take the whole winter to
get those five or six caribou,

37:34.600 --> 37:37.233
and I'm gonna wait 'til
the shot I want comes my way.

37:42.533 --> 37:43.667
Hey, look at this.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.900
Caribou hair. The wolves.

37:47.967 --> 37:49.367
They must have gotten
a caribou around here.

37:51.033 --> 37:53.833
There's the wolf! I gotta go
over there and chase that
wolf off.

37:59.900 --> 38:01.167
(GLENN HOWLING)

38:08.567 --> 38:10.033
The way I deal with wolves
when they come around

38:10.100 --> 38:11.433
is the same way
I deal with grizzly bear.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.167
I go out and talk to 'em.
I give 'em a chance.

38:13.767 --> 38:15.867
If they listen to me
and they go away,
that's all right.

38:16.367 --> 38:19.000
If they don't listen to me,
and they get too cocky,

38:19.067 --> 38:21.067
they come in closer,
I might have to shoot 'em.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.767
You can't let wolves
harass you.

38:23.233 --> 38:24.967
They have killed a couple
of people in Alaska.

38:25.533 --> 38:27.333
This guy today, he listened.
He took off.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.033
(GLENN HOWLING)

38:41.233 --> 38:44.233
What a great day it was
out hunting on the lake.

38:51.233 --> 38:54.233
You definitely don't have
to get an animal to have
a good time hunting.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.667
You just have to be patient.

38:58.133 --> 39:01.467
Sooner or later, the right
animal will come along
and I'll get the right shot.

39:04.567 --> 39:06.033
ANDY: It's up early,
to bed late,

39:06.100 --> 39:08.100
eat lots of Aspirin,
keep on going.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.933
NARRATOR: After crashing twice
while hauling firewood,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.700
Andy's dog sled
was severely damaged.

39:18.567 --> 39:20.433
Repairing it is essential
to his ability

39:20.500 --> 39:23.733
to haul resources
with his dogs for
the duration of winter.

39:23.900 --> 39:26.567
ANDY: I got the sled inside
to do an inspection on it.

39:26.800 --> 39:29.000
Brush bow's totally destroyed,

39:29.067 --> 39:32.500
plastic's totally destroyed,
delaminating runners.

39:32.933 --> 39:35.467
The more I took apart,
the more I found
wrong with it.

39:35.533 --> 39:37.800
I think it's gonna be quicker
for me to build
a whole new sled

39:37.867 --> 39:41.267
than to try and do repairs
and then rebuild this sled.

39:41.633 --> 39:46.367
When I started this morning,
I had no idea I was gonna be
building a new sled.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.933
(DRILL WHIRRING)

39:50.933 --> 39:52.667
Alaskans are very
unique people.

39:52.733 --> 39:55.600
We're all very independent,
especially people
living out in the bush.

39:55.967 --> 40:01.400
We're all very inventive,
tough, hearty souls that want
to take care of themselves.

40:07.133 --> 40:09.167
Yeah, I'm just about done.

40:09.233 --> 40:13.133
This is the final thing to do.
This is called the bridle.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.833
This is what the dogs
pull the sled with,

40:17.900 --> 40:21.400
and hopefully, I don't have
to do this again for a while.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.533
Looks pretty good.

40:24.167 --> 40:25.433
It's fairly light.

40:27.433 --> 40:30.067
It's a... It's a little more
than a one-handed sled,

40:30.533 --> 40:33.800
but I'm guessing maybe
30, 35 pounds maybe.

40:34.367 --> 40:37.800
Kind of a frustrating
chain of events today.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.767
Losing the sled,
busting it up,

40:40.833 --> 40:42.467
but I'm gonna have a new sled.

40:42.533 --> 40:44.633
I'm gonna have something
that will last me
for five or six years.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.433
There's a silver lining
in every dark cloud.

40:47.667 --> 40:51.467
Once your head gets wrapped
around that, you just get
on with the job.

40:51.600 --> 40:52.967
Let's test it out.

40:53.567 --> 40:54.967
Whoo-hoo!

41:04.833 --> 41:07.600
SUE: I'm not pushing it.
I don't see any reason
to push it.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.633
I accept that I'm in
my mid-50s and not my mid-20s.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.800
Get my coffee going.

41:25.867 --> 41:28.833
Yesterday was an amazing day!

41:29.533 --> 41:34.167
Went out after multiple
attempts at trying to
get caribou.

41:34.367 --> 41:37.100
They're not supposed to be
here this time of year.

41:37.333 --> 41:41.000
I finally achieved the goal
and got some caribou.

41:41.067 --> 41:42.967
And when you get it
in the wintertime here,

41:43.033 --> 41:46.533
when you get food like that
in the wintertime here,
it is the biggest blessing.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.133
But at the time, you're
thinking it's quite possibly
the world's largest curse.

41:51.567 --> 41:56.233
'Cause what I had
temperature-wise was anywhere
26 to 30-something below zero,

41:56.300 --> 41:59.567
20 mile-an-hour winds plus
coming out of
the south-southwest.

41:59.967 --> 42:04.000
What that means is 52 to 55
below zero wind chill factor.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.967
Took my body temp
down like that.

42:06.067 --> 42:10.500
My fingers, I was coming away
with blood, my fingers are
freezing to the knife.

42:11.067 --> 42:14.867
But I stuck with it, I got it
and this is the result.

42:17.700 --> 42:20.867
To be able to get
a fresh-cooked
little meal like this,

42:21.100 --> 42:25.800
fresh protein, is, uh,
pretty amazing for me.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.367
Much, much appreciated.

42:27.433 --> 42:29.167
Looks like my coffee's
getting there.

42:29.233 --> 42:31.567
Can't have a good breakfast
without good coffee.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.267
It may have been a tough hunt,

42:57.333 --> 42:58.700
but that's a tender
little cow.

42:59.533 --> 43:02.133
You know, it's easy to see
when you get really injured

43:02.200 --> 43:05.100
that you can just give up
and say, "Whatevs. I'm done."

43:06.000 --> 43:08.767
Um, but I haven't done that,
and I didn't do that with
the hunt either.

43:08.833 --> 43:11.600
So the hunt really typifies
how the whole year went.

43:11.700 --> 43:14.600
Successful in the end,
but a hell of a journey
getting there.
