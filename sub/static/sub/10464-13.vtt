WEBVTT

00:02.585 --> 00:04.939
Hey, no, nothing strange
about it at all.

00:04.963 --> 00:06.315
I always travel 6000 miles

00:06.339 --> 00:07.900
to visit casual acquaintances.

00:07.924 --> 00:09.151
You can't be jealous.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.611
No, I'm not. You told me

00:10.635 --> 00:12.655
nothing happened between you
and Allison last summer.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.574
I believe you. The fact that she's coming all the
way from England doesn't mean anything anyway.

00:15.598 --> 00:18.452
Julia, she's coming to
check out Berkeley.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.496
- That's it. - Yeah, I know, and
maybe she'll get accepted.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.373
And maybe she'll
live across the bay.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.833
Wouldn't that just be ducky?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.334
Right, right.

00:25.358 --> 00:28.212
We're putting her up
as a favor to her dad.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.163
That's the whole story.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.674
Anyways, Allie is not somebody...

00:31.698 --> 00:34.135
So now it's "Allie"? Allie.
That's cute.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.460
You call her Allie?

00:37.495 --> 00:38.764
Thurber food.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.642
I need a new name for myself.
You know, a hip name.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.510
I mean, does "Sarah Reeves" sound like
the lead singer in a hot band? No.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.272
You need something along the
lines of "Courtney Love."

00:46.296 --> 00:47.523
Exactly.

00:47.547 --> 00:50.943
Yeah. Like... Like
Felicia Luscious.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.518
Ha! Yeah.

00:52.594 --> 00:53.770
No.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.156
No. No.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.449
I'm sorry.

00:56.473 --> 01:00.193
I'm sorry for bothering you. Are
you Shirley Kaplan's daughter?

01:00.935 --> 01:02.111
Who?

01:03.438 --> 01:04.706
Wow, I guess not.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.834
You just look like this woman
who's in the PTA with me.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.284
And your voice too.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.787
Well, I'm sorry. My mistake.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.716
Wait a minute. What did
you say her name was?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.792
Oh, no, nothing. Never mind.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.586
Shut up, Claud.

You just crept in
under the deadline

01:58.785 --> 02:00.888
for our next session, Mr.
Salinger.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.339
Oh, yes! Thank God.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.600
That's great.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.811
That's, uh... That's great,

02:06.835 --> 02:09.896
'cause I kinda missed the deadline
at most of these other schools.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.640
My fiancee was taking care
of the applications and...

02:13.258 --> 02:14.360
Anyway,

02:14.384 --> 02:16.070
I've got a nanny who
wants his mornings,

02:16.094 --> 02:20.314
so unless I get Owen
into a preschool...

02:20.598 --> 02:23.109
Into your terrific preschool...

02:23.226 --> 02:25.820
And what was it that attracted
you to our program?

02:26.020 --> 02:29.115
Um... a lot of things.

02:29.524 --> 02:30.825
There was, uh...

02:31.109 --> 02:33.129
There was no one thing.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.463
That's the big thing.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.215
A lot of places, there's
just one thing,

02:36.239 --> 02:37.957
and here, it was, um...

02:38.491 --> 02:41.294
It was a mixture
of... Of everything.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.722
When can he start?

02:43.746 --> 02:44.640
Well,

02:44.664 --> 02:45.683
we require the child

02:45.707 --> 02:47.633
to come in and meet
with us first.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.854
Okay, sure.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.972
Uh, we can schedule that for
the day after tomorrow.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.484
And one more thing.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.903
We do require all our children
to be completely potty-trained

02:57.927 --> 02:59.395
before they begin.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.449
Uh, no problem.

03:02.473 --> 03:05.744
That's... That's not a problem.
That's not a problem at all.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.196
He practically poops on demand.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.953
Uh, can we make that
appointment late in the day?

03:17.113 --> 03:19.373
I'm serious about the
bibliographies, guys.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.334
See you Friday.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.056
I didn't understand
a single word

03:26.080 --> 03:29.133
after "Please turn to page 357."

03:29.208 --> 03:31.145
I warned you. This is
pretty dry stuff, Claud.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.439
You should have picked somebody
more interesting to follow around.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.398
No.

03:34.422 --> 03:35.566
The assignment was

03:35.590 --> 03:37.433
"someone with a
profession you respect,"

03:37.634 --> 03:39.403
and that's you, so...

03:39.427 --> 03:40.863
Can I ask you a few basics?

03:40.887 --> 03:41.906
Shoot.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.365
Did you always wanna teach?

03:43.389 --> 03:44.491
Yes.

03:44.515 --> 03:45.691
"Yes."

03:46.476 --> 03:48.069
Okay.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.655
Do you think it's okay
to date your students?

03:50.730 --> 03:51.948
What?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.126
No, of course not.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.711
'Cause the blond guy
with the chin fuzz

03:55.735 --> 03:57.004
who was sitting in first row,

03:57.028 --> 03:59.163
he is definitely
in love with you.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.374
He didn't take a
note the whole time.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.052
Okay, that's it.
No more questions.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.303
I'm buying you an ice cream.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.711
Hey.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.473
Michael, hi.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.216
Hey, I just wanted to see. We're
still on for dinner, right?

04:11.876 --> 04:13.511
Right. Yes.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.773
Um, Michael,

04:15.797 --> 04:16.815
this is Claudia.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.358
Hi, there. Listen,
I'm really sorry.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.652
I'm late for this
5:00 with Olsen.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.226
I'll call you later, okay?

04:26.391 --> 04:27.409
Great. Thanks.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.079
Okay. Your interview at
Berkeley's on Friday, right?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.580
- Right.
- All right.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.991
Well, that still leaves us,
like, three days to do stuff.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.377
Super.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.743
Super.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.423
Don't you love the way she says that?
"Super."

04:41.447 --> 04:42.591
Mm.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.125
Um...

04:44.909 --> 04:46.127
Okay.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.223
A, we could jump in
the car, head north,

04:49.247 --> 04:51.684
go to Muir Woods, Napa...

04:51.708 --> 04:53.143
Stuff like that.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.729
B, we could just hang out here.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.471
B. Definitely B.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.015
Stay here.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.933
Okay, uh...

05:01.634 --> 05:03.477
Okay, so you just
wanna stay here?

05:04.178 --> 05:06.564
I hate it when you do that.

05:07.056 --> 05:08.274
What?

05:09.225 --> 05:10.536
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.621
Oh, my God, yeah. He
does it all the time.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.539
What?

05:13.563 --> 05:17.042
You decide. "It's completely up to you.
Whatever you want. I'm easy."

05:17.066 --> 05:19.535
"Oh. Oh, you want to do that."

05:20.778 --> 05:22.214
It drives me nuts.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.456
Nuts.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.221
Oh, my God. You do not eat that!

05:29.245 --> 05:30.514
Yeah, we do.

05:30.538 --> 05:33.017
But, you can't enjoy, I mean,
you can't enjoy eating kidneys?

05:33.041 --> 05:34.852
- And blood sausage.
- Oh, G...

05:34.876 --> 05:36.270
You know what, it's delicious.
I swear to God.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.938
I'll send you the recipes

05:37.962 --> 05:39.898
- when I send you that list of CDs.
- Okay, great.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.401
You know, you haven't
compared feminine protection

05:42.425 --> 05:43.768
in your two countries yet.

05:44.343 --> 05:46.145
That is so insulting.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.813
Yeah, well...

05:49.432 --> 05:50.868
I wouldn't mind another one,

05:50.892 --> 05:52.077
you know, if you don't mind.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.195
Yep, that's what I'm here for.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.655
You too?

05:57.940 --> 05:59.251
- Super.
- Super.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.493
Super.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.092
You know, any time you wanna
move on to the next stanza,

06:07.116 --> 06:08.667
I'd be totally supportive.

06:11.329 --> 06:14.131
God. She really does look
like your mom, doesn't she?

06:14.999 --> 06:16.217
Who?

06:17.251 --> 06:18.719
Oh, you mean Julia?

06:18.753 --> 06:21.398
Look at that. I mean,
same face, same smile.

06:21.422 --> 06:22.566
Yeah.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.266
People were always saying.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.894
Did you look like your dad?

06:28.596 --> 06:30.481
No, not really.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.316
Charlie.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.278
He got his eyes and his chin.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.248
But you probably got something.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.241
You must have gotten
something from him.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.159
I can throw a mean
breaking ball.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.120
So could he.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.757
And Joe once pointed
out this thing.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.249
I'm kind of, uh...

06:48.950 --> 06:50.584
I don't know, a toucher.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.179
He used to do that:

06:52.203 --> 06:53.847
touch people whenever
he talked to them.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.089
Do I do that?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.592
Wow. Maybe I can
sing because of her.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.398
I mean, do you think Claudia's
good at music, you know,

07:03.422 --> 07:04.557
because your mom was?

07:06.509 --> 07:07.810
I guess so, yeah.

07:10.304 --> 07:11.907
Maybe I have something of hers,

07:11.931 --> 07:13.566
and I just don't know it yet.

07:15.768 --> 07:16.944
Sarah.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.156
Do you wanna look for her?

07:22.483 --> 07:24.994
Bailey, maybe she's waiting
for me to find her.

07:25.653 --> 07:29.123
I mean, maybe she's been waiting
all this time, you know?

07:29.323 --> 07:32.334
You know, and she'll see me,
and she'll take my hand.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.171
And it'll look just like hers.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.726
Yes.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.454
- You're mad.
- No, I am not mad.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.580
Yes, you are.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.280
God, I can't even believe
you're mad at me.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.160
Not at you, Sarah.

08:07.778 --> 08:09.163
Not at you, honey.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.803
I was going to be the
picture of composure

08:14.827 --> 08:16.378
when this happened.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.048
I just wanna meet
her, that's all.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.311
So that I don't pass
her on the street

08:22.335 --> 08:24.688
or stand next to her
in a movie line

08:24.712 --> 08:26.013
and not know.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.141
'Cause maybe we look
alike, you know?

08:30.218 --> 08:31.820
You know. Or sound alike

08:31.844 --> 08:34.730
or laugh at the same things.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.202
And maybe when I see her,

08:38.226 --> 08:40.693
I'll know what I'm gonna
grow up to be like.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.864
Do you understand?

08:45.691 --> 08:46.835
I mean, did you really think

08:46.859 --> 08:48.327
that I would never wanna know?

08:49.320 --> 08:50.663
I'd hoped.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.958
I'd hoped it wouldn't
matter to you.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.919
It's not gonna
change anything...

08:57.870 --> 08:58.764
between us.

08:58.788 --> 08:59.964
It won't.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.141
Here...

09:12.051 --> 09:13.811
is her name.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.191
She lives in the city. Um...

09:19.642 --> 09:21.569
At least, she did 16 years ago.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.445
Now I don't know.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.992
I love you, Mom.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.623
What if you love her too?

09:36.158 --> 09:38.419
Can't you just hope that I will?

09:40.329 --> 09:41.839
Please.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.936
Owen, listen to me.
Listen to me.

09:45.960 --> 09:46.853
What?

09:46.877 --> 09:47.854
It's 4:00,

09:47.878 --> 09:49.565
and I've already changed
your diaper five times now.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.349
We've got to start making
some progress, all right?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.060
This is what I'm prepared to do.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.826
Every time you poop,

10:00.850 --> 10:03.360
you get your choice of
these valuable prizes.

10:05.521 --> 10:06.498
Okay?

10:06.522 --> 10:07.656
Okay.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.367
I thought you said
there wasn't anyone.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.744
What?

10:12.028 --> 10:13.255
Well, you said that...

10:13.279 --> 10:15.716
I said there wasn't
anyone special, Claudia.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.675
Oh.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.125
Sure. I-I get it.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.137
Right, he's just a friend.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.389
You-you kiss everyone like that.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.349
Claudia, do... do you
want me to sit at home

10:24.373 --> 10:25.799
and just be unhappy?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.894
Well, it's just kind of fast.

10:27.918 --> 10:31.263
I mean, I thought it would
take a little longer to...

10:32.131 --> 10:33.390
you know...

10:34.467 --> 10:35.768
move on.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.188
Are you seeing him
again tonight?

10:39.472 --> 10:40.689
Claudia...

10:41.015 --> 10:42.316
Are you, like...

10:42.892 --> 10:44.276
you know...

10:45.144 --> 10:46.487
sleeping with him?

10:47.104 --> 10:48.906
Claudia, cut it out.

10:49.398 --> 10:50.792
You are 12 years old,

10:50.816 --> 10:52.117
and this is just...

10:52.902 --> 10:54.880
Okay, look, the
conversation's over.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.705
We're not talking
about this anymore.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.044
Owen, look. See?

11:02.370 --> 11:04.463
I'm sitting here on
my very own potty,

11:04.789 --> 11:06.757
and I'm making poopie,

11:06.832 --> 11:08.759
and I'm making pee-pee, see?

11:08.876 --> 11:10.678
And I'm... and I'm
very happy, see?

11:10.878 --> 11:14.264
See? I'm smiling. Look.
And I'm very happy.

11:14.465 --> 11:17.069
And my whole family's
gonna be so proud,

11:17.093 --> 11:18.227
and...

11:18.511 --> 11:19.770
Where you going?

11:20.679 --> 11:24.066
Get back here! Owen! Owen!
I'm talking to you!

11:26.727 --> 11:27.945
What?

11:31.440 --> 11:35.712
All right, a dollar is
six-tenths of a pound, right?

11:35.736 --> 11:38.673
So to figure out how
much this will cost me,

11:38.697 --> 11:40.175
I have to divide by...

11:40.199 --> 11:41.134
Hey, don't look at me.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.835
I still don't know what
eight times seven is.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.881
Hey, what do you guys think?

11:52.420 --> 11:53.804
Okay.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.890
I can't take you two anywhere.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.894
He has awful taste.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.448
Yeah. Yeah.

12:03.472 --> 12:05.232
Well, you know, not
in everything.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.985
Not in girls.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.281
You know, I didn't think
I was gonna like you.

12:12.648 --> 12:13.542
You didn't?

12:13.566 --> 12:14.742
Uh-uh.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.128
Well, the stories Justin told me

12:16.152 --> 12:17.995
about you guys hanging
out last summer.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.757
I don't know. You just sounded so...
So...

12:20.781 --> 12:22.916
What? Just say it.

12:22.950 --> 12:25.586
Stuck-up? Uptight? Nerdy?

12:26.412 --> 12:27.629
Like me.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.215
You just sounded
so much like me.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.137
Do you know what?

12:35.254 --> 12:38.098
I think this would look
really lovely on you.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.225
Hmm. Is it expensive?

12:41.427 --> 12:42.686
I, uh...

12:44.972 --> 12:47.441
I have absolutely no idea.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.361
Claudia!

12:51.937 --> 12:53.238
Claudia!

12:53.397 --> 12:55.208
Man, that was fast.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.376
What is it? What's going on?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.128
- Kirsten.
- Is he okay?

12:58.152 --> 12:59.087
Is who okay?

12:59.111 --> 13:00.496
Owen! Owen!

13:00.738 --> 13:02.549
Owen is fine. Why
would you think...

13:02.573 --> 13:04.291
Claudia said he'd
been in an accident!

13:04.450 --> 13:05.343
What?

13:05.367 --> 13:06.344
Claudia!

13:06.368 --> 13:07.429
I did not.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.797
Well, I said he'd
had an accident,

13:10.456 --> 13:12.090
and he did,

13:12.208 --> 13:13.342
sort of.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.260
Well, a poop kind of accident.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.313
What?

13:16.337 --> 13:17.272
What?

13:17.296 --> 13:19.566
God, Claudia, I thought
he got hit by a car,

13:19.590 --> 13:21.568
or swallowed a safety
pin or something!

13:21.592 --> 13:23.278
I dropped everything. I
stood up a dinner date,

13:23.302 --> 13:25.030
I ran three red lights
just to get here,

13:25.054 --> 13:27.115
all because Owen isn't
pooping in his potty?

13:27.139 --> 13:28.315
You had a dinner date?

13:28.349 --> 13:29.534
Some professor guy.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.745
That is not the point.
The point is...

13:31.769 --> 13:33.612
The point is you're here.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.249
So maybe you could give
Charlie some advice

13:36.273 --> 13:37.709
on getting Owen toilet-trained.

13:37.733 --> 13:40.327
Hey, Claud, Kirsten
really doesn't need to...

13:42.404 --> 13:43.789
I'm sorry about all this.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.916
I swear I had no idea
that she called.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.334
I'm sure you didn't.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.889
Look, I know what
you're doing, Claudia.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.599
I'm not doing anything.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.217
Yeah, you are. You're
playing games here.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.686
Now, if you wanted
to talk about this...

13:56.710 --> 13:58.679
Oh, sure. Now you wanna talk.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.482
You didn't yesterday.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.433
Because, you were asking things
you had no right to know.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.863
I'm telling you, Claudia, the way to
deal with me having a personal life

14:06.887 --> 14:08.156
is not by trying to ruin it.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.398
You got that?

14:11.392 --> 14:14.319
Ruth... Nope. No Robin.

14:14.603 --> 14:15.830
That does it for Walnut Creek.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.865
Do you have the Palo
Alto book over there?

14:19.650 --> 14:20.868
Sarah?

14:21.902 --> 14:23.203
I found her.

14:29.827 --> 14:33.297
"Robin Merrin, 6756 Maguire."

14:35.958 --> 14:37.217
Berkeley.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.219
Wow, so that's her.

14:39.628 --> 14:40.846
Are you gonna call?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.316
Uh-huh, maybe she just
got home from work

14:43.340 --> 14:45.350
and she's tired and
in a bad mood.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.780
Or maybe she's just
put her kids to bed,

14:48.804 --> 14:51.575
and she's watching
some bad rerun on TV,

14:51.599 --> 14:52.941
wishing the phone would ring.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.443
You think she has kids?

14:56.145 --> 14:57.321
No.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.708
I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.793
I don't know why I said that.

15:01.817 --> 15:04.494
No, maybe she does.
I mean, she could.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.423
You know, maybe she has
this incredible life

15:06.447 --> 15:07.883
that's exactly the
way she wants it,

15:07.907 --> 15:10.876
and the last thing she needs is
me showing up on her doorstep.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.630
Or maybe she's waited 16 years
for you to find her, Sarah.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.549
Yeah. That's what she
says in my head.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.978
She smiles, and she
holds out her arms,

15:20.002 --> 15:21.428
and she says, "At last.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.764
At last."

15:25.674 --> 15:29.019
But what if I say,
"I'm your daughter,"

15:30.012 --> 15:31.647
and then there's this pause,

15:32.264 --> 15:34.524
you know, a long, awful pause.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.288
And then her voice gets
all cold and tight,

15:38.312 --> 15:40.239
and she says, "Oh, yeah?

15:41.190 --> 15:42.699
So what?"

15:42.900 --> 15:44.660
I mean, what do I do if
that happens, Bailey?

15:44.818 --> 15:45.921
You're her daughter, Sarah.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.413
She didn't want me then.
Why would she want me now?

15:50.783 --> 15:52.167
Well...

15:54.036 --> 15:57.599
Okay, so I know her name,
and I know where she lives,

15:57.623 --> 16:01.301
and I can find her any
time I want if I want.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.388
But not now.

16:06.548 --> 16:09.017
Now it's just enough to know.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.396
So I'm gonna stop right there.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.786
God, is he ever
pissed off at us.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.570
Hey, he could have stayed.
No one kicked him out.

16:20.688 --> 16:21.957
Besides, if he wants
to be a party-pooper

16:21.981 --> 16:22.874
and go home early...

16:22.898 --> 16:23.959
It's his loss.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.251
Exactly.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.702
Who needs men, anyways?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.246
Right.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.917
God, I should never
have bought this.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.087
It-it-it looks awful.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.797
No. Wait.

16:39.581 --> 16:40.924
You've just gotta... Hang on.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.385
You've gotta tie it

16:43.919 --> 16:45.637
and scrunch it up a little.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.390
There. You look beautiful.

16:50.759 --> 16:51.977
Thanks.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.272
I think you're very
beautiful too.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.107
What?

16:58.600 --> 17:00.569
I said, I think you're
very beautiful.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.739
Thanks.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.327
Julia...

17:09.944 --> 17:11.371
Do you...

17:12.531 --> 17:14.207
Do you ever think about girls?

17:18.412 --> 17:19.588
What?

17:20.414 --> 17:22.089
About being with a girl?

17:22.540 --> 17:25.135
I mean, does that make
you sick or something?

17:27.796 --> 17:29.514
Because I think about you.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.811
Allie, I don't...

17:35.012 --> 17:36.605
Oh, God. Forget it.

17:36.764 --> 17:37.782
Why would you think...?

17:37.806 --> 17:40.400
Just forget I said
anything, okay, please?

17:40.976 --> 17:42.861
I don't even know
why I thought...

17:44.772 --> 17:46.198
I didn't mean it.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.784
I'm gonna go. Um...

17:51.320 --> 17:53.789
Please, please,
don't tell anyone.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.043
I'm sorry.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.611
He did very nicely

18:14.635 --> 18:16.696
with our blocks
and our sand toys

18:16.720 --> 18:18.239
and our circle time.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.357
I think he's made a whole
bunch of new friends.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.993
He's a pretty easygoing kid.

18:22.017 --> 18:22.911
Good.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.039
Good. Uh, well, we're
about to have snack time.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.124
Owen, would you like
to have some cookies

18:28.148 --> 18:29.667
and a big, big cup of juice?

18:29.691 --> 18:30.909
No!

18:31.652 --> 18:32.962
I mean, uh...

18:32.986 --> 18:35.006
He had plenty to drink
before he came.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.832
He doesn't need any
more to drink.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.000
He'd just float away.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.336
Okay.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.591
Um, look, we've gotta go.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.802
We... We should go.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.387
Oh, okay.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.066
Do you have any questions?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.484
Um...

18:54.508 --> 18:55.401
No.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.102
No, no. No questions.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.478
Um...

18:59.263 --> 19:01.565
I have a check, a deposit check,

19:01.765 --> 19:03.868
and that will reserve Owen's
spot in the class, right?

19:03.892 --> 19:04.786
Mm-hm.

19:04.810 --> 19:09.406
Uh, Do you... do you
mind grabbing it?

19:17.531 --> 19:18.748
What?

19:43.765 --> 19:47.745
Oh. Hi, um... I don't know
if this is the right number.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.780
I'm... I'm trying to
reach Robin Merrin.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.118
What are you doing?

19:55.485 --> 19:56.880
I'm gonna let you
two sit together.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.455
Oh, well, it's okay.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.133
Oh, come on. I know you two.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.718
You're gonna be gabbing
through the whole thing.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.136
No. Look, Justin, just
sit in the middle.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.889
No way am I gonna let
you ruin the movie

20:05.913 --> 20:07.589
by talking over me.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.509
Come on. What's the big deal?

20:20.677 --> 20:21.988
Anybody want popcorn?

20:22.012 --> 20:24.231
- I'll get it.
- No. No. It's okay. I'll go.

20:24.598 --> 20:27.901
You always get the butter-salt
ratio wrong, anyway.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.118
- Look, Julia, I...
- Forget it.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.538
I don't-I don't wanna
talk about it.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.999
- Can't-can't we just...
- No!

20:43.408 --> 20:44.834
Okay? No.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.761
It's cold in here.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.888
Mm-hm.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.349
You know what you've done?
Do you?

20:59.758 --> 21:00.693
Do you know how hard

21:00.717 --> 21:02.102
this has made things for me?

21:02.636 --> 21:04.697
I've gotta give up my mornings
to stay home with you.

21:04.721 --> 21:08.984
I gotta hire someone else at
the restaurant to open up.

21:12.938 --> 21:13.915
What's this?

21:13.939 --> 21:14.874
Is this a house?

21:14.898 --> 21:16.074
Yeah.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.294
A house. Really?

21:18.318 --> 21:20.036
Doesn't look much
like a house, pal.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.038
You know why it doesn't?

21:22.155 --> 21:25.834
Owen, do you know why?
What do houses have?

21:27.035 --> 21:28.295
What's that?

21:28.412 --> 21:30.181
Windows. Houses have
windows, don't they?

21:30.205 --> 21:31.266
Yeah.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.841
Can you draw me a window here?

21:33.542 --> 21:34.801
Owen?

21:35.544 --> 21:36.729
I want you to... Hey!

21:36.753 --> 21:38.513
I need you to draw me a window.
Owen? What...

21:38.839 --> 21:40.066
Damn it!

21:40.090 --> 21:42.568
Own, do you know how hard it
is to get that stuff off?

21:42.592 --> 21:44.070
You don't crayon on furniture!

21:44.094 --> 21:45.405
How many times have
I told you that?

21:45.429 --> 21:48.398
Why can't you listen? Why can't you for
once in your life do what you're told?

21:52.060 --> 21:53.862
He's just a baby, Charlie.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.952
And... action!

22:02.154 --> 22:04.340
My Billy can't keep a secret.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.633
Ketchup from the French fries

22:05.657 --> 22:07.260
I told him he couldn't have.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.970
Slide into third base
when he promised me

22:08.994 --> 22:11.212
he'd be coming straight
home from school.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.558
And here, a chocolate
snuck he snacked before...

22:13.582 --> 22:15.008
I'm sorry.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.302
- That's a cut!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.188
Snack he snuck. Snack he snuck.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.857
I don't even know why
I keep saying that.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.984
Yeah, look, uh, let's
take a break, shall we?

22:23.008 --> 22:23.985
Back in 10, people.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.602
Okay, thanks.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.574
Snack he snuck. Snack he snuck.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.107
Damn it.

22:33.685 --> 22:34.829
Excuse me.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.613
That's Robin there?

22:36.730 --> 22:37.947
Thanks.

22:39.733 --> 22:40.950
We're back.

22:44.529 --> 22:45.506
Uh, hello?

22:45.530 --> 22:46.924
Hi. I'm sorry, I...

22:46.948 --> 22:48.833
Oh, my God, you're
not Billy, are you?

22:49.242 --> 22:51.002
- What? No.
- Oh!

22:51.495 --> 22:52.597
Thank God.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.098
I told my agent eight
years old tops.

22:54.122 --> 22:57.092
You never know what they're gonna
spring on you at the last minute.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.179
yes?

23:02.464 --> 23:03.848
Um...

23:04.549 --> 23:07.445
I know this is gonna
sound really weird.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.363
I tried to reach you at
home, and I spoke to...

23:09.387 --> 23:11.815
You called my home? Why is that?

23:12.140 --> 23:14.818
I'm sorry. Do I know you?
Do we know each other?

23:14.976 --> 23:16.611
My name is Bailey Salinger,

23:17.437 --> 23:18.738
and I'm...

23:20.232 --> 23:21.908
I'm a friend of your daughter's.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.505
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong person.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.038
I don't have a daughter.

23:27.322 --> 23:28.748
But you did.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.501
Sixteen years ago you did.

23:36.498 --> 23:39.008
Sweetheart, can we see you
on your mark, please?

23:47.509 --> 23:49.477
Charlie really yelled
at Owen today.

23:50.762 --> 23:54.534
I mean, I know I
kind of exaggerated

23:54.558 --> 23:56.953
about what was going on before,

23:56.977 --> 23:59.038
but now it's really bad.

23:59.062 --> 24:00.540
Tell you what, Claud,

24:00.564 --> 24:02.449
I'll correct your
spelling for you, okay?

24:03.066 --> 24:04.127
That's it. No rewriting.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.586
"Psychology" is C-H-O.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.911
Can you hear me?

24:07.154 --> 24:08.756
I said he was screaming at him.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.081
What do you want me to say?

24:12.492 --> 24:14.836
The two of them are going
through a rough time right now.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.347
I'm sorry, but that happens.

24:16.371 --> 24:18.214
Look, I'm not playing games.

24:18.748 --> 24:21.602
And I'm not trying to make
trouble for you and that guy.

24:21.626 --> 24:22.927
It's just...

24:23.587 --> 24:25.565
Like, you could help
if you were there.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.348
But I'm not there, Claudia.

24:27.465 --> 24:28.734
I can't be there.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.768
Oh, gee. My mistake.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.739
I thought you cared.

24:33.763 --> 24:36.492
Hey, I do care! I care a lot.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.485
The truth is, I care too much.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.570
So what I am trying to do...

24:40.854 --> 24:43.332
What I am trying to do every
day is to care a little less,

24:43.356 --> 24:44.750
but you're not helping, Claudia.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.502
You're not making it any easier.

24:46.526 --> 24:49.589
You drop these things like...
Like crumbs,

24:49.613 --> 24:51.122
like breadcrumbs.

24:51.239 --> 24:52.508
And I know if I follow them,

24:52.532 --> 24:54.093
they're gonna lead me
straight back to your house

24:54.117 --> 24:55.835
and to your family
and to you brother.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.183
So I am asking you, I am
begging you, Claudia,

25:00.207 --> 25:03.009
please, don't tell me,

25:03.043 --> 25:05.595
because I really, really
don't wanna know.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.562
I guess you've probably
thought a lot about this,

25:14.804 --> 25:15.781
you know, over the years,

25:15.805 --> 25:18.441
that she might come looking
for you one of these days.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.901
Um...

25:20.227 --> 25:21.611
No, not really.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.905
Almost not at all.

25:26.566 --> 25:29.077
I guess she wants to know
why I left her, right?

25:30.278 --> 25:32.163
She wants an explanation.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.091
Wants to blame me.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.416
I don't think so.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.502
She's not a very angry person.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.962
Really, she just...

25:39.746 --> 25:42.600
She just wants to know
who she is, you know?

25:42.624 --> 25:43.883
And, and...

25:44.542 --> 25:45.519
And that you love her.

25:45.543 --> 25:47.647
That I... love her?

25:47.671 --> 25:50.316
I-I don't... Look.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.943
Why would I love her? I
don't even know her.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.570
Okay, okay, not yet, but
when you meet her...

25:54.594 --> 25:56.563
Look. No, no. This is...

25:57.597 --> 25:58.856
This is not...

26:00.058 --> 26:02.777
I don't know what you thought
I was gonna do here.

26:03.019 --> 26:03.913
I gave her up,

26:03.937 --> 26:05.122
I gave her away,

26:05.146 --> 26:07.083
and it wasn't some kind
of noble thing, okay?

26:07.107 --> 26:08.334
My career was just taking off.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.628
I was on tour, and having
a kid just didn't fit in.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.245
It was lousy timing.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.424
You can say whatever
else you want about me,

26:15.448 --> 26:17.125
but at least I know
my limitations.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.920
And I don't look back,
and I don't regret it.

26:21.037 --> 26:22.515
So I'm sorry if
this little girl...

26:22.539 --> 26:24.725
Here. Look at this. I
have this picture.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.310
No, I don't want to
look at pictures.

26:26.334 --> 26:28.062
Here, it was just
taken five days ago.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.146
Would you please...

26:29.170 --> 26:32.056
Stop it! I don't wanna
see your damn pictures.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.060
I don't want a
16-year-old daughter.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.240
And you have no right
to come in here

26:39.264 --> 26:40.533
with your stupid pictures

26:40.557 --> 26:42.775
and make me feel like... Like...

26:43.560 --> 26:44.861
Listen.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.832
I did the best thing
I could for her.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.824
I gave her better
parents than me.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.505
Well, what am I
supposed to tell her?

26:54.529 --> 26:56.382
You tell her that you
stuck your nose in

26:56.406 --> 26:57.624
where it doesn't belong.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.251
Just tell her to forget it.

27:02.078 --> 27:04.756
Tell her I'm dead, if
that makes it any easier.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.259
Yeah.

27:09.919 --> 27:11.387
That'll make it much easier.

27:14.507 --> 27:15.892
Whoo!

27:17.052 --> 27:18.269
Whoo!

27:22.265 --> 27:24.734
Hey, it's weird, huh, her
wanting to come here.

27:24.851 --> 27:25.745
What?

27:25.769 --> 27:28.247
I mean, she always said that
she hated this kind of scene,

27:28.271 --> 27:30.948
and then out of the blue
she wants to go clubbing.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.043
What?

27:32.067 --> 27:33.711
I can't hear you. I
can't even hear me!

27:33.735 --> 27:34.952
All right. Come on.

27:43.244 --> 27:45.171
Oh, hey, you guys!

27:45.330 --> 27:46.432
Guess what?

27:46.456 --> 27:49.634
Phil here had his nose
pierced in Liverpool.

27:50.293 --> 27:52.595
No kidding. Imagine that.

27:52.962 --> 27:54.357
I mean, I let it close up.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.349
My mom has really
high blood pressure.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.477
Isn't he cute?

28:00.011 --> 28:01.113
You're cute.

28:01.137 --> 28:02.480
You're cute.

28:03.890 --> 28:05.817
Well, then, I guess
it's unanimous.

28:06.142 --> 28:07.735
Wanna take me home?

28:08.853 --> 28:10.154
Let's get out of here.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.249
Lead the way.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.793
You're not really going
with him, are you?

28:13.817 --> 28:15.326
Allison...

28:15.568 --> 28:17.745
Allison, come on. This
is not a good idea.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.330
How much have you had to drink?

28:20.657 --> 28:21.833
Allison!

28:25.829 --> 28:27.640
What the hell is wrong
with you all of a sudden?

28:27.664 --> 28:29.266
Come on, Allie. You don't
even know this guy.

28:29.290 --> 28:31.060
I'm gonna get to know
him, right, Phil?

28:31.084 --> 28:33.979
Actually it's Gil. Gil.
You know, like fish.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.346
Don't do this.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.150
Don't do this. Please,
don't do this.

28:38.174 --> 28:40.361
Hey, hey, why don't we all go
get some coffee, all right?

28:40.385 --> 28:41.570
Buzz off, pal.

28:41.594 --> 28:42.780
What are you trying to prove?

28:42.804 --> 28:44.532
Are you doing this to
spite me, is that it?

28:44.556 --> 28:46.315
- Shut up, Julia, okay?
- Hey!

28:46.391 --> 28:47.910
Why don't you just lay the hell off.
All right?

28:47.934 --> 28:49.912
Listen, Phil, Gil...
whatever your name is,

28:49.936 --> 28:51.038
she's not interested in you.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.331
Oh, really?

28:52.355 --> 28:54.157
Well, you could have fooled me.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.700
Right, honey?

28:58.319 --> 28:59.714
She doesn't wanna go with you.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.539
What makes you so damn sure?

29:01.990 --> 29:04.292
Look, she's not
interested in boys, okay?

29:10.206 --> 29:11.424
Allie!

29:23.803 --> 29:24.979
Allie?

29:25.555 --> 29:27.065
Get away from me.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.195
I'm sorry.

29:33.229 --> 29:34.614
Yeah, well,

29:34.898 --> 29:36.324
it's done.

29:36.649 --> 29:38.002
You said it, okay?

29:38.026 --> 29:41.505
You said it and, and,
and now it's out there,

29:41.529 --> 29:44.207
and I can't take it
back, and people know.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.429
So what? So what if people know?

29:48.453 --> 29:51.015
Oh, right! Like
you don't get it.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.558
Like it doesn't make you sick!

29:52.582 --> 29:53.684
- Allie...
- But it's okay,

29:53.708 --> 29:56.636
because I have the
same problem, see?

29:56.920 --> 29:58.304
What?

30:00.673 --> 30:01.776
Why...

30:01.800 --> 30:03.235
Why do I have to feel this way?

30:03.259 --> 30:07.656
Why can't I force myself
to talk about boys

30:07.680 --> 30:09.440
and wanna be with boys and...

30:09.516 --> 30:10.534
Why would you do that?

30:10.558 --> 30:12.985
Because it's hard, okay?

30:13.686 --> 30:15.530
And I don't wanna be different,

30:15.688 --> 30:18.250
and I don't want anyone to look
at me the way you looked at me,

30:18.274 --> 30:20.127
and my mother and my father...

30:20.151 --> 30:23.746
I can't. I just can't. Not ever.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.334
I'm sorry.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.420
Why?

30:32.789 --> 30:34.475
It was my mistake,

30:34.499 --> 30:37.311
and you can't feel anything
you don't feel, right?

30:37.335 --> 30:40.179
I mean, I'm living
proof of that.

30:43.675 --> 30:44.851
I just...

30:46.427 --> 30:50.148
I feel so completely alone.

30:51.057 --> 30:54.161
And I want someone,
you or someone,

30:54.185 --> 30:55.871
to say it's okay,

30:55.895 --> 30:58.239
to say I'm okay.

30:58.690 --> 31:02.368
Just to say, "I love you too."

31:06.614 --> 31:07.915
God.

31:19.419 --> 31:20.845
Morning, Claud.

31:24.382 --> 31:25.776
What are you doing?

31:25.800 --> 31:27.101
Sitting.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.312
How come?

31:31.097 --> 31:32.481
I was just thinking.

31:34.183 --> 31:36.736
Wondering, actually, why none
of my stuff is up there.

31:37.937 --> 31:41.574
They're all yours. Yours
and Bay's and Julia's.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.753
Your hand prints, your collages,

31:44.777 --> 31:46.662
all these dopey paintings.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.081
There's nothing of mine.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.418
Why do you think that is?

31:53.119 --> 31:54.420
Beats me.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.225
Maybe Mom and Dad didn't get
the idea to frame stuff

31:58.249 --> 31:59.967
until you were already big.

32:01.794 --> 32:04.055
I drew a picture of
a skyscraper once.

32:06.215 --> 32:08.017
I brought it in to
show it to Dad.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.937
He looked at it, and he
kind of sat me on his lap.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.232
I remember thinking that
he was gonna hug me,

32:15.850 --> 32:17.912
but instead he just
started going on

32:17.936 --> 32:19.330
about proportions:

32:19.354 --> 32:20.956
how it needed to be
wider at the base,

32:20.980 --> 32:23.125
how a building that
tall and narrow

32:23.149 --> 32:24.867
would just fall right over.

32:27.695 --> 32:29.038
God, I hated that...

32:31.115 --> 32:32.500
His...

32:33.409 --> 32:34.752
Um...

32:34.911 --> 32:37.213
His insane expectations.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.550
And now, all of a
sudden it turns out...

32:43.586 --> 32:45.221
I've got 'em too.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.391
I'm making the same mistakes,

32:48.967 --> 32:50.518
his mistakes.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.272
Go figure, huh?

32:56.099 --> 32:57.650
That's so weird.

32:59.185 --> 33:01.195
I mean, he was never
like that with me.

33:01.604 --> 33:02.780
Hmm.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.459
Maybe that's the way it happens

33:05.483 --> 33:06.867
with firstborns.

33:07.443 --> 33:09.704
I guess by the time the
other kids come along,

33:10.571 --> 33:12.665
the parents have learned
not to push so hard.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.545
Owen...

33:19.038 --> 33:20.548
He's Dad's last, but...

33:22.333 --> 33:24.260
he's kind of my first, you know?

33:26.462 --> 33:27.888
So I was thinking...

33:30.633 --> 33:33.019
I was thinking I should
clear a space for this

33:33.761 --> 33:35.313
so that he knows...

33:36.639 --> 33:38.232
it didn't need windows.

33:47.316 --> 33:48.293
Claud!

33:48.317 --> 33:49.618
Don't be mad.

33:49.944 --> 33:50.963
Are you mad?

33:50.987 --> 33:52.464
Well, no, but...

33:52.488 --> 33:53.716
I wanted to tell you something.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.175
Only it's not about you-know-who

33:55.199 --> 33:57.011
or anything that's
happening at home.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.627
Actually, that's pretty okay.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.546
I mean, the Owen situation.

34:00.621 --> 34:01.724
It's pretty okay.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.142
But I know you don't
wanna know about that,

34:03.166 --> 34:04.592
and that's not why I'm here.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.553
Ta-da! I got an A.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.313
Hey, Claud, that's great.

34:09.338 --> 34:10.848
I know. Isn't it?

34:11.174 --> 34:13.027
So maybe we can, like,
go out and celebrate.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.518
Ice cream's on me this time.

34:15.844 --> 34:17.730
Claudia, I can't.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.442
I'm-I'm meeting Michael.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.072
Okay.

34:26.773 --> 34:29.408
I mean, I understand.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.587
Hey, Kirsten,

34:31.610 --> 34:34.914
Daddy said maybe you'd go
with us to the Exploratorium.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.592
I'm so sorry, Kirs.
Marjorie called.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.833
She got stuck in court, so
I had to pick up Frannie.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.378
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.181
One of these days, she and I are
gonna work all this out, right?

34:43.206 --> 34:44.507
Who are you?

34:45.458 --> 34:46.801
Who's she?

34:48.293 --> 34:49.594
Claudia...

34:51.422 --> 34:52.681
Claudia...

34:53.007 --> 34:54.475
Claudia, come back here.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.734
So much for saving time
on surface streets, huh?

35:06.813 --> 35:08.864
You're not mad at me for
taking you, are you?

35:09.732 --> 35:11.085
The airport's kind of on my way.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.410
It's fine.

35:18.825 --> 35:21.001
I was thinking about
you going to Berkeley,

35:21.494 --> 35:24.473
and I know it's none
of my business,

35:24.497 --> 35:26.424
but I don't think you should.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.009
Really?

35:29.460 --> 35:31.480
Well, gee, thanks.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.440
No. I don't mean that
the way it sounds.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.318
It's just... I've been
trying to figure out

35:36.342 --> 35:39.446
why you would travel 5000
miles to go to school,

35:39.470 --> 35:40.572
you know?

35:40.596 --> 35:43.408
Or why you would be
interested in me.

35:43.432 --> 35:44.743
Forget it, Julia, okay, please?

35:44.767 --> 35:46.036
And what I figured out

35:46.060 --> 35:49.196
is it's actually
because I'm far away

35:49.897 --> 35:51.708
and Berkeley's far away

35:51.732 --> 35:53.617
from anyone you know.

35:55.486 --> 35:57.288
We're kind of safe that way.

36:04.203 --> 36:06.755
Listen, I know it's
easy for me to say,

36:07.373 --> 36:09.675
but I don't think you
should run away, Allie.

36:17.550 --> 36:20.311
It looks like it's just that
traffic signal up ahead.

36:20.761 --> 36:23.063
I bet it'll be pretty
clear sailing after that.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.110
Yeah.

36:38.237 --> 36:39.497
You didn't...

36:40.489 --> 36:42.166
Why didn't you return my calls?

36:43.242 --> 36:45.211
I guess I didn't
wanna talk to you.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.214
Claudia, this is
hard for me too.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.716
Are you trying to
replace all of us?

36:51.834 --> 36:53.636
Is that what you're doing
with that little girl?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.387
Are you trying to replace me?

36:55.588 --> 36:56.722
No.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.984
I don't believe you.

36:59.008 --> 37:02.487
Claudia, I can't replace
you or Charlie or Owen.

37:02.511 --> 37:04.021
It's not possible.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.899
But I gotta try to move on.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.369
I'm gonna try to find
somebody who loves me.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.237
Even if it's not this man,

37:11.395 --> 37:12.905
then somebody else.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.325
And if he has children, Claudia,
then so much the better.

37:18.027 --> 37:20.839
Listen, you are gonna
have new people

37:20.863 --> 37:22.456
in your life too.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.876
And I'm gonna have
to live with that.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.378
Like...

37:28.246 --> 37:30.422
Okay, like when Charlie
marries someone else.

37:30.706 --> 37:31.924
Aren't you gonna love her?

37:33.793 --> 37:34.969
No.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.137
Claudia, I...

37:38.381 --> 37:40.683
I-I don't know what
to do about us.

37:42.343 --> 37:44.863
If I don't get away from
this house and your brother

37:44.887 --> 37:46.698
and all these things that
aren't mine anymore...

37:46.722 --> 37:48.107
I get it.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.735
You can stop now.

38:08.202 --> 38:09.420
Claudia...

38:10.079 --> 38:12.339
I am always gonna
be here for you,

38:13.833 --> 38:15.519
and if you ever really need me,

38:15.543 --> 38:17.229
you just pick up the
phone and you call me,

38:17.253 --> 38:19.805
and I promise you I
will be there for you.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.101
Okay?

38:29.098 --> 38:30.566
Okay, Claudia?

38:36.397 --> 38:38.198
Are we kind of breaking up?

38:42.278 --> 38:43.912
Is that what we're doing?

38:54.623 --> 38:55.799
Bailey?

38:55.875 --> 38:58.270
Damn it, they screwed up
the stupid order again.

38:58.294 --> 38:59.187
Look at this.

38:59.211 --> 39:01.430
This is not kung pao chicken.
This is...

39:02.465 --> 39:03.766
This is...

39:06.677 --> 39:08.145
This is pretty good, actually.

39:08.512 --> 39:09.772
Never mind.

39:10.473 --> 39:11.408
You know how sometimes

39:11.432 --> 39:13.108
phone numbers can
have letters in them?

39:14.352 --> 39:16.528
You mean like 1-900-HOOTERS?

39:18.939 --> 39:20.574
So I watch some late-night TV.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.284
Do we need plates for this?

39:22.526 --> 39:24.453
We don't need plates, do we? No.

39:24.737 --> 39:27.373
So I took a look at
her phone number.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.417
My mother's. You
know, just for fun.

39:31.410 --> 39:34.046
And guess what the last
four digits spelled.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.507
Sara.

39:36.665 --> 39:39.093
7-2-7-2-SARA.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.648
Well, you spell your
name with an H.

39:43.672 --> 39:44.900
But it's almost the same thing.

39:44.924 --> 39:47.486
I man, it's enough of the
same thing to mean something,

39:47.510 --> 39:48.811
don't you think?

39:50.137 --> 39:51.480
I don't know.

39:55.309 --> 39:56.286
I think

39:56.310 --> 39:58.570
maybe you want it to mean
something that it doesn't.

40:00.564 --> 40:03.242
I went through one of those
revolving doors yesterday,

40:03.609 --> 40:04.711
you know, the ones in Macy's,

40:04.735 --> 40:07.371
and there was this
woman in front of me

40:07.571 --> 40:09.132
who was reflected in the glass,

40:09.156 --> 40:13.544
and she had my eyes and
my nose and my dark hair,

40:13.994 --> 40:15.305
and my heart stopped
for a second,

40:15.329 --> 40:16.880
because I thought...

40:18.916 --> 40:20.592
Only it was me.

40:22.211 --> 40:23.679
My reflection.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.900
I had to sit in hosiery
for, like, 10 minutes

40:26.924 --> 40:28.517
just to catch my breath.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.855
It's funny. I'm looking for
her even when I'm not.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.693
So I think maybe I
should call her.

40:39.186 --> 40:40.580
You know, I should
stop being afraid

40:40.604 --> 40:42.239
and just do it.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.122
She's not your mother, Sarah.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.624
The woman in the phone book.
She's not.

40:53.242 --> 40:54.594
What? Why would you say that?

40:54.618 --> 40:55.720
Because...

40:55.744 --> 40:57.421
Look, please don't be mad,

40:57.913 --> 40:59.715
but I called her,

41:00.124 --> 41:01.592
and I went to see her for you.

41:03.043 --> 41:04.229
You did? You saw her?

41:04.253 --> 41:07.055
I just thought that if
it was her, then...

41:07.923 --> 41:10.485
Only, see, Robin Merrin:

41:10.509 --> 41:12.728
That's not her real name.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.449
She had this really
horrible name,

41:15.473 --> 41:18.785
so she changed it, like, 10
years ago to Robin Merrin.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.068
So...

41:20.895 --> 41:24.198
So Robin Merrin isn't even who
she really is, this woman.

41:25.316 --> 41:28.994
And she never gave a
child up for adoption.

41:30.529 --> 41:32.080
She never even had a child.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.626
Oh.

41:38.245 --> 41:39.713
Oh.

41:41.624 --> 41:42.966
I'm sorry.

41:43.417 --> 41:44.760
Uh-huh.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.057
Are you mad?

41:50.341 --> 41:52.518
Mad, at you? No.

41:52.801 --> 41:54.895
No. In fact, thank you. God...

41:55.179 --> 41:56.364
That would have been awful

41:56.388 --> 41:58.732
if I would have gotten my
hopes up and everything.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.827
You know what, the food's
probably getting cold,

42:00.851 --> 42:02.078
so we should...

42:02.102 --> 42:03.320
Hey.

42:15.115 --> 42:17.251
I know I promised
I'd never do this.

42:18.327 --> 42:19.513
What the hell?

42:19.537 --> 42:21.630
As long as you don't
fidget too much.

42:34.176 --> 42:35.519
Oh, wait.

42:45.104 --> 42:47.155
Accidents can happen, right?

43:05.416 --> 43:07.050
It's kind of nice, huh?

43:08.502 --> 43:10.345
We'll leave that
light on tonight.

43:21.682 --> 43:23.108
Sleep well.
