[computer beeping]
Oh, damn.

00:03.637 --> 00:05.173
Lost another file.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.141
Gonna have to reboot...
again.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.143
[computer chimes]

00:09.177 --> 00:11.512
Hey, Dwight,
do you want an Altoid?

00:11.545 --> 00:14.615
What do you think?

00:16.784 --> 00:19.753
(Jim)
In school, we learned
about this scientist

00:19.787 --> 00:22.556
who trained dogs to salivate
at the sound of a bell

00:22.590 --> 00:25.359
by feeding them
whenever a bell rang.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.128
So for the past couple weeks

00:27.161 --> 00:30.464
I've been conducting
a similar experiment.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.833
[computer chimes]

00:32.866 --> 00:33.767
Dwight, want an Altoid?

00:33.801 --> 00:36.637
Okay.

00:36.670 --> 00:37.638
[computer chimes]

00:37.671 --> 00:38.639
Altoid?

00:38.672 --> 00:41.409
Sure.

00:41.442 --> 00:42.643
[computer chimes]

00:42.676 --> 00:43.644
Altoid?

00:43.677 --> 00:45.713
[imitating Jim]

00:45.746 --> 00:48.416
Yes.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.184
[computer chimes]

00:53.121 --> 00:54.188
What are you doing?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.258
I--

00:57.291 --> 00:58.326
What?

00:58.359 --> 00:59.860
I don't know, I--

00:59.893 --> 01:04.765
Oh, my mouth tastes so bad
all of a sudden.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.202
Ugh.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.871
[cheerful music]

01:10.904 --> 01:19.113
*

01:41.169 --> 01:42.436
Always the bridesmaids.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.238
Right, ladies?

01:44.272 --> 01:46.140
(photographer)
Okay, for this next one,
everybody hop out.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.176
Just Phyllis and Dad.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.644
Actually, let's bring Mom
back in.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.346
And the sisters.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.382
And you and you and you.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.718
(photographer)
Great.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.320
(Michael)
Phyllis is getting married.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.888
And I am in the wedding party.

02:00.921 --> 02:01.922
She has asked me

02:01.955 --> 02:03.791
to push her father's
wheelchair down the aisle.

02:03.824 --> 02:07.461
So basically,
I am co-giving away the bride.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.330
Since I pay her salary,

02:09.363 --> 02:11.799
it is like I am paying
for the wedding.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.234
Which I'm happy to do.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.768
It's a big day
for Phyllis.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.238
But it's an even bigger day
for me.

02:17.271 --> 02:20.174
Employer of the bride.

02:20.208 --> 02:23.311
Yes, I put Michael
in my wedding.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.812
It was the only way
I could think

02:24.845 --> 02:28.416
to get six weeks off
for my honeymoon.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.319
No one else has ever gotten
six weeks before.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.888
Phyllis ended up using
the exact same invitations

02:34.922 --> 02:37.525
as Roy and me.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.860
So it was kind of like
being invited

02:39.893 --> 02:41.229
to my own wedding.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.963
And I was like, wait...

02:42.996 --> 02:45.165
I thought I called that off.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.502
So, what's in the box?

02:48.536 --> 02:50.771
A toaster. You?

02:50.804 --> 02:52.240
Uh, toaster.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.575
Unbelievable.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.679
Hello, Angela.

02:58.712 --> 03:02.850
You look as beautiful
as the Queen of England.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.385
Thank you.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.988
Don't linger.
Break left.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.524
Left.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.997
(Dwight)
The Schrutes
have their own traditions.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.434
We usually marry
standing in our own graves.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.703
Makes the funerals
very romantic.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.573
But the weddings
are a bleak affair.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.975
(Jim)
Those flowers are nice.

03:28.008 --> 03:31.011
Yeah. "P and R?"

03:31.044 --> 03:32.346
"Phyllis and Robert."

03:32.380 --> 03:34.582
Ah, of course.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.484
Also "Pam and Roy."

03:38.552 --> 03:41.555
There she is!

03:41.589 --> 03:43.357
I swear, Phyllis,
you are as beautiful

03:43.391 --> 03:44.792
as the first day
you started work

03:44.825 --> 03:45.859
at Dunder-Mifflin.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.329
Thanks, Michael.
That's sweet.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.030
Same as when you said it
outside.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.465
Mm, how you doing?

03:51.499 --> 03:53.467
You excited?

03:53.501 --> 03:54.468
Yes, very.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.736
Me too.

03:55.769 --> 03:59.673
If, um--if you need to vomit,
that is okay.

03:59.707 --> 04:00.941
I did.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.576
Do you want to talk
about tonight?

04:02.610 --> 04:03.711
No.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.313
Because I know
you're probably worried

04:05.346 --> 04:06.480
about pleasing Bob.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.616
A lot of pressure.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.019
[whispering]
Phyllis, did you break wind?

04:12.052 --> 04:14.922
It's okay if you did.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.957
It's a very natural reaction.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.926
It's your wedding
and you're nervous.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.729
Um, that wasn't me.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.964
Okay.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.933
Um...

04:25.966 --> 04:30.003
I'm sure that Bob...

04:30.037 --> 04:33.974
wow, that is...

04:34.007 --> 04:35.008
that is pungent.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.911
Um, I lost
my train of thought.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.448
Uh...

04:40.481 --> 04:41.749
are you set
on that hairstyle?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.851
I thought it was--

04:43.884 --> 04:44.918
Here, let me--

04:44.952 --> 04:45.886
Michael, no.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.888
Just cover up
that bald patch.

04:47.921 --> 04:48.722
No, Michael.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.424
Please, I just need
some time alone.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.892
Okay, okay.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.361
You might be surprised
to learn

04:53.394 --> 04:55.863
that I have only been
to one other wedding.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.965
It's actually
a very cute story.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.433
My mom was marrying Jeff

04:59.467 --> 05:01.669
and they asked me
to be ring bearer.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.704
And I was understandably
emotional

05:03.737 --> 05:06.340
and somehow my pants
became wet.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.842
[Michael on video crying]

05:08.876 --> 05:11.479
[on video]
I hate you!

05:11.512 --> 05:12.713
Long story short--

05:12.746 --> 05:15.816
Jeff's dog ended up
as ring bearer.

05:15.849 --> 05:19.887
And the irony is that
after the ceremony,

05:19.920 --> 05:24.425
that dog peed
on everything.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.360
And nobody said boo.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.928
(Dwight)
Why are all these people here?

05:27.961 --> 05:30.097
There's too many people
on this earth.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.366
We need a new plague.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.967
Who are all these people?

05:34.001 --> 05:35.102
You know what?

05:35.135 --> 05:37.538
I bet a lot of them
are wedding crashers.
No way.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.740
Did you ever see
that movie?
Of course I saw it.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.142
I saw Wedding Crashers
accidentally.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.611
I bought a ticket
for Grizzly Man

05:43.644 --> 05:44.712
and went into
the wrong theater.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.947
After an hour, I figured
I was in the wrong theater.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.849
But I kept waiting.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.684
Because that's the thing
about bear attacks--

05:50.718 --> 05:52.586
They come when
you least expect it.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.821
You know, I just wish--

05:53.854 --> 05:55.456
I wish I had
the investigative powers

05:55.489 --> 05:57.691
to actually smoke
some of these guys out,

05:57.725 --> 06:00.661
you know?

06:00.694 --> 06:03.631
Once again, Jim...
I will take care of this.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.699
I will locate
the wedding crashers

06:05.733 --> 06:08.135
and report them
to Phyllis.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.438
That way
I won't have to get her a gift.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.372
Hi, I'm Kevin.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.076
Where'd you find her?

06:16.109 --> 06:19.079
At the gym.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.948
Right.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.916
The gym!

06:22.950 --> 06:24.918
[stifling laughter]

06:24.952 --> 06:27.655
Could you scoot over?
You're on my dress.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.689
I thought you're
not supposed

06:28.722 --> 06:29.790
to wear white
to a wedding.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.092
I know, but there was
an emergency.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.095
I look really good
in white.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.130
This strapping young lad
sitting here

06:37.164 --> 06:38.566
is Phyllis' father, Elbert.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.867
And he is quite
the ladies' man,

06:39.900 --> 06:41.969
aren't you, Elbert, huh?

06:42.002 --> 06:43.471
Ah, ring bearer.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.906
I could've done better.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.741
I will do better.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.810
I am going to be better.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.178
Can't believe I'm actually
doing this.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.846
[sighs deeply]

06:52.880 --> 06:54.915
Are you ready for this,
Elbert?

06:54.948 --> 06:57.017
I am.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.752
Let's do it!

06:58.786 --> 07:01.755
[Wedding March plays]

07:01.789 --> 07:05.926
*

07:05.959 --> 07:08.195
That's my dress.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.682
(Michael)
No, no, it's okay.

07:28.716 --> 07:29.817
It's...

07:31.919 --> 07:33.020
[crowd muttering]

07:33.053 --> 07:34.955
(man)
It's a miracle.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.658
[crowd applauding]

07:47.835 --> 07:49.837
[whispering]
This is bull [bleep].

07:51.004 --> 07:52.272
Me walking Phyllis
down the aisle

07:52.305 --> 07:53.907
was supposed to be
the highlight of the wedding.

07:53.941 --> 07:57.545
And now...
the wedding has no highlight.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.254
I can't believe
I pushed that--

08:07.287 --> 08:11.024
that guy's lazy ass around
all day

08:11.058 --> 08:13.794
until he was ready
to stand up

08:13.827 --> 08:15.128
and steal the show.

08:15.162 --> 08:15.996
That's...

08:16.029 --> 08:19.166
well, I got news for you,
Elbert...

08:19.199 --> 08:21.001
if that's your real name...

08:21.034 --> 08:22.502
the show's not over.

08:43.290 --> 08:47.127
(priest)
Phyllis and Bob,
Bob and Phyllis...

08:58.606 --> 09:00.741
And do you, Phyllis,
take Bob Vance

09:00.774 --> 09:02.209
of Vance Refrigeration

09:02.242 --> 09:03.811
to be your lawfully
wedded husband.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.245
I do.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.614
(Michael)
Ladies and gentlemen!

09:06.647 --> 09:07.948
May I present to you,

09:07.981 --> 09:09.950
for the first time
as a couple,

09:09.983 --> 09:12.586
Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!

09:18.692 --> 09:20.060
And do you, Bob,
take Phyllis

09:20.093 --> 09:21.128
(Michael)
Oh, shh...

09:21.161 --> 09:23.363
(priest)
to be your lawfully
wedded wife?

09:23.396 --> 09:24.832
I do.

09:24.865 --> 09:25.999
You may now kiss
the bride.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.034
Ladies and gentlemen!

09:27.067 --> 09:28.636
For the first time
as a couple,

09:28.669 --> 09:29.703
Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!

09:31.872 --> 09:33.707
(Michael)
Yeah!

09:33.741 --> 09:36.977
That's what
I'm talking about!

09:37.010 --> 09:38.746
Congratulations, Phyllis.

09:38.779 --> 09:39.747
Oh, thank you.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.682
You look lovely.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.817
Your dress is very white.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.653
So white my eyes are burning.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.820
Thanks, Angela.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.389
Congratulations, Bob.
You're a good man.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.891
But just know...

09:50.924 --> 09:53.193
if you ever lay a finger
on Phyllis,

09:53.226 --> 09:54.227
I will kill you.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.630
If yo ever lay a finger
on Phyllis,

09:56.664 --> 09:58.365
I'll kill you.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.767
Agreed.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.268
No fingers will be laid
on Phyllis!

10:01.301 --> 10:02.803
[chuckling]

10:02.836 --> 10:04.672
Oh, decide
to sit down again, huh?

10:04.705 --> 10:05.806
Great.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.908
Bet you can hear me too.

10:07.941 --> 10:08.942
Best of luck, Phyllis.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.143
Also, I'm gonna need to see

10:10.177 --> 10:11.344
a copy of the guest manifest,

10:11.378 --> 10:13.046
as well as photographs
of the caterers.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.381
I don't have that, Dwight.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.249
Damn it, Phyllis!

10:18.686 --> 10:20.253
Are you all right?

10:20.287 --> 10:22.322
This must be
so awful for you.
What do you mean?

10:22.355 --> 10:24.925
Well, this was supposed
to be your wedding.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.796
Oh, um,
no, that's, um...

10:28.829 --> 10:30.063
it's actually fine.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.231
There's no way it's fine.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.199
I'm sorry.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.967
If I was you, I would just,
like, freak out

10:34.001 --> 10:35.135
and get really drunk

10:35.168 --> 10:36.269
and then tell someone
I was pregnant.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.672
Okay, that's a lot
of good ideas.

10:38.706 --> 10:41.074
