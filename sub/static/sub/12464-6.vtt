WEBVTT

00:06.606 --> 00:08.240
Bingo! Bonanza!

00:08.242 --> 00:10.209
Big news.

00:11.244 --> 00:13.245
My boyfriend's coming to town.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.279
( Squeals )

00:14.281 --> 00:15.681
Boyfriend?!

00:15.683 --> 00:16.982
Boyfriend...

00:16.984 --> 00:19.051
<i>Boyfriend.</i>

00:20.787 --> 00:23.655
Liv's been long-distance
dating Miller white...

00:23.657 --> 00:25.791
the world-class skateboarder
with the famous ponytail.

00:25.793 --> 00:28.027
He pulled off the first ever

00:28.029 --> 00:30.262
nose-grab five forty
hand-plant.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.897
Impressive.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.032
But can he drain
a buzzer-beater

00:33.034 --> 00:34.299
from half court at regionals?

00:34.301 --> 00:35.567
Bam! What?!

00:37.303 --> 00:40.639
Why is Miller white
coming to Stevens point,
Wisconsin?

00:40.641 --> 00:43.108
Oh, to see me, myself and I.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.210
( Both squeal )

00:45.212 --> 00:48.714
He's skateboarding in
a competition downtown
this weekend,

00:48.716 --> 00:49.848
and get this:

00:49.850 --> 00:52.217
His sponsor,
"flip kick magazine,"

00:52.219 --> 00:54.119
asked me to be
a celebrity judge.

00:54.121 --> 00:57.890
Liv, you are many things...

00:57.892 --> 01:00.125
But seriously?

01:00.127 --> 01:01.860
The judge of
a skateboarding competition?

01:01.862 --> 01:03.595
Celebrity judge.

01:05.331 --> 01:09.268
Emphasis on <i>celebrity.</i>

01:09.270 --> 01:12.304
Hey, I have skateboarding cred.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.839
You're forgetting,
not only am I the star of

01:13.841 --> 01:15.774
¶ sing it loud!

01:15.776 --> 01:17.676
I'm also the star of
the highest-grossing

01:17.678 --> 01:19.778
skateboarding
bank robber movie ever.

01:19.780 --> 01:24.049
In between seasons of
¶ sing it loud,

01:24.051 --> 01:27.052
Liv starred in a movie
called "the skateboard bandit."

01:27.054 --> 01:29.788
A girl, a bag of loot,
a skateboard.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.858
She'll take your money
and steal your heart.

01:33.993 --> 01:36.295
Liv, you do know that being
in a skateboarding movie

01:36.297 --> 01:38.931
doesn't actually qualify you
to judge skateboarders.

01:38.933 --> 01:42.901
Well, the good people
at "flip kick magazine"
think differently.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.270
I'm picking my credentials
up Saturday morning,

01:45.272 --> 01:47.239
and you can come with me
if you want to meet Miller.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.807
Ugh, I can't.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.609
Early morning
basketball practice

01:50.611 --> 01:51.611
compliments of coach dad.

01:51.612 --> 01:55.114
No, Maddie,
I need you with me
to run interference.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.116
When the family knows
that Miller's in town,
they're gonna want to meet him

01:57.118 --> 01:59.251
and then they're gonna
completely embarr-a-blast me.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.053
These people have been
embarrassing me

02:01.055 --> 02:02.387
for the past four years.

02:02.389 --> 02:03.856
Your turn now, Hollywood.

02:03.858 --> 02:06.859
<i>( Theme music plays )</i>

02:06.861 --> 02:08.360
<i>¶ Better in stereo</i>

02:08.362 --> 02:10.796

02:10.798 --> 02:12.831

03:02.215 --> 03:05.417
Look at that ponytail fly,
Parker.

03:05.419 --> 03:09.288
Can you believe we are
actually breathing the
same air

03:09.290 --> 03:11.390
as Miller white?

03:11.392 --> 03:13.158
Ooh.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.127
Some little kid
left his skateboard.

03:15.129 --> 03:16.328
We should bring it
to lost and found.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.163
No no no!
Don't touch that!

03:18.165 --> 03:20.832
That is Stanley.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.001
It's Miller white's
first skateboard.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.270
He built it himself
when he was eight.

03:25.272 --> 03:28.240
He takes it with him
everywhere.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.175
I wish I was Stanley.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.910
Okay, got my judge's badge.

03:31.912 --> 03:35.147
before anymore damage to
my relationship is done.

03:35.149 --> 03:36.381
No, honey,

03:36.383 --> 03:37.950
I want to meet your boyfriend.

03:37.952 --> 03:39.284
This is just the kind of thing

03:39.286 --> 03:41.420
that we missed out on
when you were in Hollywood.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.854
You'll introduce us.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.423
He'll be nervous,

03:44.425 --> 03:45.891
but I will settle him down
and let him know

03:45.893 --> 03:47.092
that I'm not just your mom.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.494
I'm also your
super-cool friend.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.365
Great, pal.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.367
But let's get going.

03:55.369 --> 03:58.337
Miller's practicing
and he's totally slammed.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.172
Doesn't even have
a sec to say hey.

04:00.174 --> 04:02.808
Hey!

04:02.810 --> 04:03.875
Miller.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.811
Hey, cute-sicle.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.412
Oh, is this the fam?

04:07.414 --> 04:09.248
Hi, I'm Karen,
cute-sicle's mom.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.316
Oh, you're the psychologist.

04:11.318 --> 04:12.818
Can you see my future?

04:14.153 --> 04:15.420
You're thinking of a psychic.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.490
Wow, you are good.
I totally was!

04:20.093 --> 04:21.426
They brought Miller in
to teach me how to skateboard

04:21.428 --> 04:22.961
for my new movie.

04:22.963 --> 04:23.962
They would not have
brought him in

04:23.964 --> 04:25.497
to teach me rocket science.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.765
Or simple math.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.502
Little guy's Parker, and...

04:35.375 --> 04:36.908
I'm Joey...

04:36.910 --> 04:40.078
the misunderstood ladies man.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.147
Whoa.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.316
So this is your
identical twin, huh?

04:46.819 --> 04:48.153
No.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.955
Maddie's coming later.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.823
She's a blonde.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.292
And a girl.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.427
Cool.

04:55.429 --> 04:58.096
Hey dude,
ever tried to
grow a ponytail?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.398
It's pretty sick.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.300
Whoo!

05:01.302 --> 05:05.304
Kinda got this look
I'm locked into here.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.838
Cool.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.307
Uh, would you excuse us?

05:08.309 --> 05:09.975
We have some super top secret

05:09.977 --> 05:11.443
skate biz to attend to.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.378
Bye, Miller.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.182
Thanks for being
so sweet with my fam.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.417
Oh, no prob.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.951
I have one too.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.286
( Giggles )

05:21.288 --> 05:23.355
You look really
great by the way.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.890
It's so nice to
see you in the reals.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.225
It's nice to be
seen in the reals.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.562
Oh, someone wants to say hey.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.097
Hey!

05:34.300 --> 05:36.301
Miller, I dig you,

05:36.303 --> 05:38.970
but I'm not saying
"hey" to your skateboard.

05:40.306 --> 05:41.907
That's cool.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.242
I don't want you
talking to other
dudes.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.179
Well hey, I gotta go practice,

05:47.181 --> 05:48.381
but I'll see you later tonight?

05:48.382 --> 05:49.481
You gonna shine bright?

05:49.483 --> 05:50.882
Like a diamond.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.352
I'm gonna walk away now.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.053
Not if I walk away first.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.055
Both: Oh oh oh oh.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.323
( Both chuckle )

05:58.325 --> 05:59.991
- All right.
- Okay. Yeah.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.361
Okay, okay.
( Giggles )

06:02.363 --> 06:04.429
( Sighs ) Okay, people!

06:04.431 --> 06:06.098
The competition
starts in four hours

06:06.100 --> 06:07.299
which leaves me only
three and a half

06:07.301 --> 06:09.034
to figure out
what I'm gonna wear.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.369
Wait, we have to leave already?

06:10.371 --> 06:11.570
We just got here.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.305
Can't we stay
and watch practice?

06:13.307 --> 06:15.907
All right, but no spitting,

06:15.909 --> 06:17.242
hitting or yelling.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.243
And if you get into
any trouble,

06:18.245 --> 06:19.378
your last name is not Rooney.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.912
It is Johnson.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.619
Okay.
What do you guys think?

06:27.621 --> 06:28.920
Is Miller gonna like this?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.322
Does it say
fantasta-licious

06:30.324 --> 06:33.458
with a touch of
bling-a-ding-ding?

06:33.460 --> 06:34.993
I stopped having an opinion

06:34.995 --> 06:37.195
like 12 bling-a-ding-dings
ago.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.664
You know my vote.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.199
If a boyfriend's around,

06:41.201 --> 06:42.667
go with sweatpants
and a baggy shirt.

06:44.637 --> 06:45.971
You can go now, dad.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.305
Yes!

06:47.307 --> 06:51.009
Lacking any style
pays off again.

06:52.311 --> 06:55.180
I tried to teach mom
what an app was last week,

06:55.182 --> 06:57.249
and that was less
grueling than this.

06:57.251 --> 07:00.185
( Cellphone dings )

07:00.187 --> 07:01.520
Oh! It's Miller.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.322
His texts are like poetry.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.657
( Clears throat )

07:05.659 --> 07:07.125
"Hey cute-sicle,

07:07.127 --> 07:09.194
loved our fly-by
this afternoon."

07:09.196 --> 07:11.029
"Fly-by"... adorbs!

07:12.498 --> 07:13.665
"Don't take this the wrong way,

07:13.667 --> 07:15.434
but I'm breaking up with you.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.336
It's not you, it's me.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.572
Well,
me and Stanley."

07:21.674 --> 07:24.342
Liv, I'm so sorry.

07:26.512 --> 07:27.712
You know, just 'cause I'm a dad

07:27.714 --> 07:29.648
doesn't mean I can't
handle girl stuff.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.650
- ( Sobs )
- Ooh. Crying.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.251
I'll get mom.

07:37.723 --> 07:38.990
<i>( Knocks )</i>

07:40.660 --> 07:43.094
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.130
Maddie told me the bad news.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.332
Honey, I'm so so sorry.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.667
( Sighs )

07:48.669 --> 07:50.202
You know,

07:50.204 --> 07:52.170
as any good psychologist knows,

07:52.172 --> 07:53.738
there's only two ways
you ever really feel

07:53.740 --> 07:55.340
when someone
breaks up with you.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.709
Sad or mad.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.745
If you're feeling sad...

08:00.747 --> 08:05.350
I have the hugging pillow.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.652
And if you're feeling mad,

08:07.654 --> 08:10.322
I have the punching pillow.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.591
Now when I was
dating your father,

08:12.593 --> 08:14.326
I used both of them.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.460
Constantly.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.297
Miller text-dumped you?

08:19.299 --> 08:21.166
Who does that?

08:22.602 --> 08:24.669
What a jerk!

08:26.372 --> 08:29.674
But he used ocean body spray.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.209
( Sighs )

08:31.211 --> 08:33.678
He always
smelled like the beach.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.113
I love the beach.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.617
He ruined the beach!

08:40.353 --> 08:42.487
I've been kicked to the curb.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.155
And we're back to the hugger.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.558
That is a great
rhythm you got
going there.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.264
Whoa!

08:52.266 --> 08:54.332
Joey:
<i>Oh, the masked shredder!</i>

08:55.668 --> 08:58.403
They say he wears the mask
'cause he's taken so many falls

08:58.405 --> 09:00.205
that he doesn't
even have a face.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.740
And he will shred anything.

09:01.742 --> 09:05.343
'Cause he's the craziest
guy in the circuit.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.345
He is known for his wipeouts.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.480
There's this one
on the Internet

09:08.482 --> 09:10.215
where he caught so much air

09:10.217 --> 09:11.750
he took out a duck.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.687
The masked shredder.
I have got to get
a picture with him.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.689
I'll put it in my locker,
and it'll totally up

09:17.691 --> 09:19.524
my hallway cred.

09:19.526 --> 09:22.527
But he's charging for pictures.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.529
All right.
I guess we're doing
the old sneak-and-snap.

09:24.531 --> 09:25.630
I'll walk up behind him,

09:25.632 --> 09:27.566
give my patented
cool guy face...

09:29.702 --> 09:31.102
Then you snap our picture.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.537
Okay.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.806
But be careful.
He's a bad dude,

09:34.808 --> 09:36.341
and you're kind of a...

09:36.343 --> 09:37.676
how do I say this?

09:37.678 --> 09:40.278
Weak baby kitten.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.480
It's go time.

09:45.351 --> 09:46.351
( Growls )

09:46.353 --> 09:47.686
( Screams )

09:47.688 --> 09:49.568
( Deep, distorted voice )
You two, come with me.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.224
( Grunts )

09:53.226 --> 09:54.693
I'm too young to die.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.228
I'm even younger.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.364
I can't believe this.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.099
( Normal voice ) Joey Rooney?

10:02.368 --> 10:04.636
Skippy Ramirez?

10:04.638 --> 10:07.305
You're the masked shredder?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.641
Sure am.
I have not seen you in years.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.376
I know.
I just assumed

10:11.378 --> 10:14.346
you pretended to move away
and stopped calling me.

10:14.348 --> 10:17.816
Not that that's ever happened.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.351
Wait.

10:19.353 --> 10:22.120
The masked shredder
knows my brother?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.422
Joey was the first guy
to get me on a skateboard.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.693
My brother taught
the shredder how to skate?

10:28.695 --> 10:30.695
Wait,

10:30.697 --> 10:33.765
is Joey <i>not</i>
<i>a total butt nugget?</i>

10:35.234 --> 10:36.501
I gotta warm-up.
Feel free to hang here

10:36.503 --> 10:38.436
and take whatever you want
from my swag bag.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.679
( Deep, distorted voice )
Just don't eat my lemon yogurt!

10:48.247 --> 10:50.248
Ooh.
This must be bad.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.650
Mom's got the pillows out.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.386
Hey, mads.

10:54.388 --> 10:56.688
Okay. You ready to go
to that competition?

10:56.690 --> 10:58.590
No way.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.492
It'd just be too hard
to face Miller.

11:00.494 --> 11:03.261
Liv, don't do this, okay?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.696
Don't let him win.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.231
You are Liv Rooney,

11:06.233 --> 11:08.299
international teen sensation.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.903
you should be out there
sticking it to Miller.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.438
I don't think I like
that tone, Maddie.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.473
You think you need
punchy for a few minutes?

11:16.375 --> 11:18.543
Mom, can we have
some twin time please?

11:18.545 --> 11:20.245
Oh, sure.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.380
I was there for all
36 hours of your labor,

11:22.382 --> 11:24.449
but if you don't need me
in this moment of crisis,

11:24.451 --> 11:25.675
I guess that's fine.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.721
Liv, I am not gonna
let you sit here

11:29.723 --> 11:33.458
We are going to march
down to that skate park

11:33.460 --> 11:34.626
and hit Miller where it hurts.

11:34.628 --> 11:36.428
We are?

11:36.430 --> 11:38.363
I love it when you get
all "Friday night lights" on me.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.432
( Squeals )

11:40.434 --> 11:42.267
Keep talking.
Just don't spit so much.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.703
We are going after
the one thing

11:44.705 --> 11:46.371
Miller cares about most.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.273
That stupid skateboard.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.241
( Gasps ) Stanley!

11:50.243 --> 11:51.376
Yes.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.311
Stanley's going down.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.379
Faboosh.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.714
We have a plan.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.248
Which is so great
because my outfit

11:57.250 --> 11:58.450
totally came together today.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.857
( Cheering )

12:08.394 --> 12:09.527
Welcome, fans.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.995
I'm Johnny nimbus,

12:10.997 --> 12:13.331
your channel four
meteorologist,

12:13.333 --> 12:15.400
sitting alongside
professional skateboarder

12:15.402 --> 12:16.801
spike bickle.

12:16.803 --> 12:18.470
But who cares about us, right?

12:18.472 --> 12:20.905
You're here to see
a real celebrity judge.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.374
And here she is, Liv Rooney!

12:23.376 --> 12:25.510
She's the star of
the hit summer blockbuster

12:25.512 --> 12:27.245
"the skateboard bandit,"

12:27.247 --> 12:29.714
and ¶ sing it loud.

12:29.716 --> 12:30.915
Did I do that right, Liv?

12:30.917 --> 12:32.450
Not even close, Johnny.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.385
Fantastic.
Hey folks,

12:34.387 --> 12:35.787
I gotta tell you,

12:35.789 --> 12:38.256
I was checking out
this Miller white earlier today

12:38.258 --> 12:40.925
and I think he is
positively boss.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.961
Liv, that word "boss,"
is that still hip?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.896
Right up until the second
you said it, Johnny.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.531
Great stuff.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.933
Johnny: <i>Hey fans,</i>
<i>we're five minutes away...</i>

12:48.935 --> 12:51.002
Hey, Liv.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.004
Hey, before you start judging,
I need to talk to you.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.539
Oh no, I'm not
who you think I am.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.475
Shh shh shh.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.011
Move the finger or
you lose the finger.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.447
I know you're angry,
but hear me out.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.382
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have dumped you.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.050
I get all crazy before I skate

13:06.052 --> 13:07.819
and do stupid things.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.020
But...

13:09.022 --> 13:12.390
Any chance you'll take me back?

13:13.392 --> 13:15.059
Oh, I see.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.861
You just text-dump a girl

13:16.863 --> 13:19.464
and then you suddenly
remember she's a judge
at your competition

13:19.466 --> 13:21.065
so you suddenly ask her
to take you back?

13:21.067 --> 13:22.534
Well, not happening.

13:22.536 --> 13:23.668
Step it, Miller.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.670
Bam! What?!

13:25.672 --> 13:26.838
( Groans )

13:26.840 --> 13:29.474
Dudes, a little help?

13:30.409 --> 13:32.811
Okay.
Um, skippy?

13:32.813 --> 13:35.079
What's wrong?

13:35.081 --> 13:37.749
( Normal voice )
I sprained my ankle
doing a gangnam style.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.553
You're up next.
How are you gonna compete?

13:41.555 --> 13:42.720
I'm not.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.389
I hate to let my fans down,

13:44.391 --> 13:46.391
but I guess I'm out
of the competition.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.526
Then let Joey take your place.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.395
Wait, what?

13:50.397 --> 13:52.430
Just wear the mask.
Nobody will know.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.332
Little dude's right.
You can do this.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.667
You're the one who
taught me how to skate.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.535
I was four.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.404
We were sitting on the board
eating animal crackers

13:59.406 --> 14:02.407
and I accidentally
rolled down the driveway.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.410
Skippy, since we parted

14:05.412 --> 14:07.612
I've focused more
on the sedentary

14:07.614 --> 14:09.781
video game angle
of skateboarding.

14:09.783 --> 14:11.416
( Chuckles )

14:11.418 --> 14:13.117
Joey, you don't have to win.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.552
That's not what
my fans look for.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.087
You just have to
wipe out so huge

14:16.089 --> 14:17.388
that you go viral.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.090
Or if you guys hold the ropes,

14:19.092 --> 14:22.594
I can wow the crowd
with my double-Dutch skills.

14:22.596 --> 14:25.463
Dude, if the masked shredder
wants you to skate for him,

14:25.465 --> 14:27.398
you gotta do it.
For the fans.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.867
For me.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.402
Parker never looked
at me that way before.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.404
I wasn't gonna let him down.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.808
Even though it meant
I would likely die.

14:39.144 --> 14:40.478
You're the shredder now.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.546
Shred on!

14:43.415 --> 14:45.483
( High-pitched )
I am totally going
to dominate.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.420
( Normal voice )
Can someone teach me
how to work the voice thingy?

14:51.490 --> 14:56.394
And coming up next...
ooh, the masked shredder.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.496
- <i>( Cheers and applause )</i>
<i>- All right, dude, remember.</i>
<i>You are the shredder.</i>

14:58.498 --> 15:00.498
So the crowd's here
to watch you wipe out.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.167
But before you do,
you've got to put
on a show.

15:03.169 --> 15:04.636
Okay, catch some air,

15:04.638 --> 15:06.004
kickflip into
a no-comply,

15:06.006 --> 15:07.472
turn that into
a pop-shove it,

15:07.474 --> 15:09.574
wave to the audience
and wrap it with a mctwist.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.542
Simple.

15:11.544 --> 15:12.610
Question,

15:12.612 --> 15:14.746
am I allowed to
do this sitting?

15:14.748 --> 15:16.414
( Laughs )

15:16.416 --> 15:17.749
Animal crackers style.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.017
You're hilarious.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.585
( Screaming )

15:21.987 --> 15:23.421
- <i>( Crashing )</i>
<i>- Oh my!</i>

15:23.423 --> 15:25.623
The masked shredder
just shredded himself

15:25.625 --> 15:26.791
like a pork sandwich.

15:30.562 --> 15:31.962
( Deep, distorted voice )
Nailed it.

15:32.569 --> 15:34.099
Hey, extreme sports fans,

15:34.100 --> 15:39.504
get ready to blow the roof
off the mega extreme sports
complex.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.774
'Cause entering the arena
is the reason we're all here.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.442
The man, the myth,

15:44.444 --> 15:46.911
the 17-year-old
skate legend...

15:46.913 --> 15:48.813
Miller white!

15:48.815 --> 15:50.181
<i>( Cheering )</i>

15:52.751 --> 15:54.485
Hey!

15:56.588 --> 15:57.822
Johnny:
<i>Ah, there it is.</i>

15:57.824 --> 16:01.759
<i>marching around with his</i>
<i>good luck board, Stanley.</i>

16:01.761 --> 16:03.695
Liv,
isn't Miller white something?

16:03.697 --> 16:05.029
Oh yeah, Johnny.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.832
He's definitely something.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.803
Yeah, that's right.
Kiss that skateboard.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.237
Kiss it good-bye.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.107
Bam! What?!

16:16.109 --> 16:17.241
Why are you "bam what" -ing?

16:17.243 --> 16:19.477
Are you and your sister
up to something?

16:19.479 --> 16:22.046
Let's just say
that text-dumper's

16:22.048 --> 16:23.781
about to be cut down to size.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.583
Oh honey, I know it's tempting

16:25.585 --> 16:28.886
but it never feels
as good as you think it will.

16:28.888 --> 16:31.055
No mom, you don't get it.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.757
He hurt my sister.
He's a jerk.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.225
Oh no, I do get it.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.095
When my high school
boyfriend broke up
with me,

16:37.097 --> 16:40.098
I tap danced all over
his precious muscle car

16:40.100 --> 16:41.766
in high heels.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.235
Oh, it felt good
for about five seconds,

16:44.237 --> 16:46.771
but to this day,
every time I put on heels

16:46.773 --> 16:47.872
I feel ashamed.

16:48.886 --> 16:50.109
You know, who knows?

16:50.110 --> 16:53.544
Maybe Miller's gonna realize
he made a mistake

16:53.546 --> 16:56.647
That's how you know
he's a nice guy.

16:57.282 --> 17:00.618
<i>( Cheering )</i>

17:03.722 --> 17:05.690
Johnny:
<i>All right.</i>

17:05.692 --> 17:07.792
<i>Miller white looks ready to go.</i>

17:07.794 --> 17:09.694
<i>The hairs on the back of my</i>
<i>neck are standing up straight.</i>

17:09.696 --> 17:12.230
Probably 'cause they're not
a luscious shimmering ponytail

17:12.232 --> 17:13.765
like Miller white has.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.099
You're catching what
I'm laying down,

17:15.101 --> 17:16.567
aren't you, spike bickle?

17:17.236 --> 17:19.670
<i>Oh! There it is folks,</i>

17:19.672 --> 17:21.205
<i>the patented ponytail wave.</i>

17:21.207 --> 17:24.042
That means Miller white's
ready to get crazy.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.977
Hold on there, Johnny.

17:25.979 --> 17:30.248
I have a special
presentation for him.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.584
Ooh! Do I smell
a song coming on?

17:33.586 --> 17:34.752
You sure do, Johnny.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.320
<i>It's a lullaby.</i>

17:36.322 --> 17:37.321
For Stanley.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.057
( Crowd gasps )

17:39.059 --> 17:40.992
Whoa, Liv.

17:40.994 --> 17:43.327
What are you doing
with Stanley?

17:43.329 --> 17:44.695
Teaching you a lesson.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.131
Text-dumping is uncool.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.966
So much better
to do it in person

17:48.968 --> 17:50.668
when you can have
a clean break!

17:50.670 --> 17:52.236
No!

17:52.238 --> 17:53.204
Stop!

17:53.206 --> 17:56.641
Stopping you from making
a huge mistake.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.843
Miller apologized.
He thought I was you.

17:59.912 --> 18:00.978
Wait.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.817
This is your identical twin?

18:05.819 --> 18:07.952
Yeah, that makes
a lot more sense.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.189
This just in, folks,

18:11.191 --> 18:13.191
due to her actions here today,

18:13.193 --> 18:16.127
"flip kick magazine"
has disqualified Liv Rooney

18:16.129 --> 18:19.597
as a judge in this competition.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.300
to get kicked out of
this dog and pony show, folks?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.336
Hey, fans,

18:25.338 --> 18:27.271
how do you feel
about Liv Rooney?

18:27.273 --> 18:29.173

Boo!

18:34.147 --> 18:35.113
Boo!

18:35.115 --> 18:36.614
What are we booing?

18:36.616 --> 18:37.982
Your daughter.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.151
Miller apologized
and you didn't tell me?

18:40.153 --> 18:42.386
Liv, I was protecting you.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.188
I mean, I thought
if he was a jerk

18:44.190 --> 18:46.257
then he'd never change,

18:46.259 --> 18:47.792
but who knows.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.926
Maybe he's just a great guy

18:48.928 --> 18:50.361
who did a really dumb thing.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.864
He said he was sorry
and he wants to get

18:52.866 --> 18:55.299
back together with you.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.268
He did the right thing,

18:57.270 --> 18:58.669
he just did it to
the wrong girl.

19:00.272 --> 19:01.739
Miller,

19:01.741 --> 19:03.407
I'm sorry.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.877
And if you want to
get back together,

19:05.879 --> 19:08.312
I say we give it a try?

19:08.314 --> 19:11.682
Nah, I didn't really mean that.

19:11.684 --> 19:12.717
What?

19:12.719 --> 19:13.918
What?

19:13.920 --> 19:17.188
I realized that you could
ruin my scores.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.990
So I apologized
and strung you along

19:18.992 --> 19:20.258
so I could win.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.360
But you're not a judge anymore,

19:22.362 --> 19:24.328
so don't be a hater.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.830
See you later.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.270
Wait a minute.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.938
What's she doing
with those scissors?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.139
- <i>( Snips )</i>
<i>- Oh no!</i>

19:35.141 --> 19:38.342
Ponytail down!
Ponytail down!

19:41.146 --> 19:42.280
My ponytail.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.348
You cut off my ponytail.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.787
- Did you just...?
- I did.

19:52.157 --> 19:54.926
This is why
we punch the pillows.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.201
Okay, like way more
to your right.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.335
Like way more.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.939
<i>Okay, now back a little bit.</i>
<i>Tiny bit to your left.</i>

20:07.941 --> 20:08.973
<i>Up a little bit.</i>

20:08.975 --> 20:10.174
Perfect.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.413
I can't believe
Miller let us keep that.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.281
( Chuckles )

20:17.283 --> 20:18.883
See?

20:18.885 --> 20:21.285
Being grounded
isn't gonna be so bad.

20:21.287 --> 20:25.156
These two weeks are
just gonna fly by.

20:25.158 --> 20:26.224
How long has it been?

20:26.226 --> 20:27.291
15 minutes.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.397
How are you doing on
the whole breakup thing?

20:33.399 --> 20:35.166
Still hurting,

20:35.168 --> 20:37.835
but I'm gonna
get over it eventually.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.303
Will it make you feel better

20:39.305 --> 20:40.905
if we watch
"the skateboard bandit"?

20:40.907 --> 20:43.140
( Gasps ) Are you serious?

20:43.142 --> 20:44.909
Maddie,
you're the best sister ever.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.144
Wait.
We're grounded.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.746
Mom and dad aren't gonna
let us watch anything.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.248
Oh, Maddie, it doesn't matter.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.250
I can act it out for you.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.251
( Dramatically ) We open...

20:53.253 --> 20:55.419
On a deserted bank.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.988
A grungy street kid

20:56.990 --> 20:59.357
zooms by on a skateboard.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.359
She's pretty,
but doesn't know it.

21:01.361 --> 21:04.295
Oh, I'm pretty sure
she knows it.

21:05.163 --> 21:07.531
( Chuckles, snorts )

21:09.301 --> 21:11.302
- <i>( Crashing )</i>
<i>- Whoa!</i>

21:11.304 --> 21:13.804
Dude, that was epic.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.539
You out-shredded
the shredder.

21:15.541 --> 21:19.043
Your new wipeout video
has over a million hits
already.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.511
You're bigger than
the dog that says...

21:20.513 --> 21:22.847
( Mock howling )
"I love you."

21:24.383 --> 21:27.151
Once again,
Joey Rooney has schooled me.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.886
Props to the master.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.289
( Slowly )
I would high-five you,

21:31.291 --> 21:35.293
but I cannot feel my arm.

21:35.295 --> 21:39.297
Or see you very clearly.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.798
I'm proud of you, munch.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.233
Thanks.

21:42.235 --> 21:44.335
That means a lot, dad.
