I totally named him after you.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.105
Hey, little man. Come here.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.773
Come here.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.276
Hey, buddy.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.528
-[giggling]
-I'm your daddy.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.572
Your dada.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.115
Your papa.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.288
You owe me 600 diaper changes.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.100
Going into a dark basement on purpose?

15:59.083 --> 16:01.502
That would freak me out
even if it wasn't the Apocalypse.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.462
Doc, hush.

16:02.545 --> 16:06.132
Sorry, sorry.
Those are my inside thoughts.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.843
Over there.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.100
Nice, 10K.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.186
Gasoline powered.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.771
That gallon you found
will last us an hour, maybe two.

16:20.855 --> 16:21.689
Cool.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.361
Helen from accounting is sick as a dog.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.239
She's paying the price for Taco Tuesday,
let me tell you.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.075
Never eat Mexican before a newscast.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.412
I don't care if the FAA
has grounded everything at Straubel.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.706
Get Chopper 9 in the air.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.208
Two minutes to live!

16:40.291 --> 16:41.292
Two minutes.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.460
Two minutes, Jack.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.087
Let me tell you something, OK?

16:45.171 --> 16:48.633
Um, I want a real cue
from you for a change.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.718
I don't just want you
waving your arms around.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.221
Hard point. This is breaking news.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.680
The hard point.

16:55.223 --> 16:57.141
Have a little pride in your work.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.227
Yes, sir.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.020
What a dick.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.897
Survivors? What?

17:02.980 --> 17:06.901
Renfro, take a breath. Sit tight.
You're on in 30 seconds.

17:06.984 --> 17:10.279
We have survivors.
We're going live to the crash.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.949
[man] All right, Lock it up.
We're going live.

17:15.868 --> 17:20.790
We interrupt this program
for an Action News 9 special report.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.544
-I'm Jack Kingman.
-And I'm Carly McFadden.

17:24.627 --> 17:29.966
Midwest Air Flight 409 has crashed
near Green Bay with 46 passengers aboard.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.594
We're receiving preliminary reports
that there may be survivors.

17:33.678 --> 17:37.348
With Action News team coverage,
we go live to the crash site now

17:37.431 --> 17:40.309
and our own Mike Renfro. Mike?

17:41.143 --> 17:43.646
<i>Come on! Run! Mitchell, run!</i>

17:43.729 --> 17:44.689
<i>-Mike!</i>
-[growling]

17:44.772 --> 17:46.983
[Jack] Mike, describe the scene for us.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.903
-[shouting]
-Mike, tell us what we're seeing there.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.706
Uh, we have lost the feed from Mike,
our reporter.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.666
And he...

18:10.590 --> 18:13.926
We are experiencing technical difficulties
with our live remote

18:14.010 --> 18:18.389
from the crash of Midwest Air Flight 409,
as you saw, a chaotic scene.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.100
Initial reports indicate
there are survivors,

18:21.183 --> 18:23.728
and we're working
to verify that information.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.731
We'll bring you more details
as this story develops.

18:26.814 --> 18:30.610
For Jack Kingman, I'm Carly McFadden.
Action News 9.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.113
-And we're out.
-What the hell was that?

18:34.196 --> 18:36.657
Why was Mike running from a story?

18:38.159 --> 18:40.578
[indistinct chatter]

18:42.496 --> 18:43.623
[woman screams]

18:53.633 --> 18:55.760
That generator can power all of this?

19:12.276 --> 19:15.196
[Warren] This place looks like
it hasn't been touched in eight years.

19:39.136 --> 19:43.140
The new report suggests zombies
can be bad for your health. Film at 11:00.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.433
Keep alert.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.977
The Zs that did this
are probably in here somewhere.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.646
The clock hates us.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.981
That generator will only give us
about an hour of power.

19:51.065 --> 19:53.818
Yeah, so look for anything
that can help us contact Kaya.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.362
Look for a satphone, CB radio.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.738
I'll check these offices.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.910
Some uninvited guests are poking around.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.579
Yeah, their chopper flew over me
as I was arriving.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.708
I thought you were
one of those Zona goons.

20:08.791 --> 20:09.959
Please forgive me.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.961
I don't want you thinking
that clunk on the head

20:12.044 --> 20:14.630
was some passive-aggressive
outburst for you knocking me up

20:14.714 --> 20:16.716
and then leaving town for two years.

20:16.799 --> 20:17.883
OK, well,

20:17.967 --> 20:21.178
you knew that they were in matching
black combat gear and I was in a parka.

20:21.262 --> 20:24.014
So what is on this base that they can't
hack or find somewhere else?

20:24.098 --> 20:26.267
I don't know. Could be anything.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.603
This place was a top secret
NSA base for 40 years.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.189
There are off-line server farms
and Jurassic Technology

20:32.273 --> 20:33.524
I've never even fired up.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.109
[beeping]

20:36.360 --> 20:37.361
[Citizen Z] Zona.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.114
I haven't intercepted
anything from Zona in a while.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.200
There was a spike of crazy transmissions
a few months ago.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.078
And now, radio silence.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.332
From what I've intercepted over the years,
Zona's a bunch of rich bastards

20:50.416 --> 20:53.711
who enjoy living in their
hermetically sealed zombie-free paradise.

20:54.128 --> 20:55.546
Then why are they here?

21:01.552 --> 21:03.137
What do you make of that?

21:03.220 --> 21:05.473
We could target a satellite
using one of their dishes.

21:05.556 --> 21:06.891
See if anybody's listening.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.227
All right. Let's give it a shot.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.229
Time I learned
how to aim a satellite dish.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.155
This just in.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.824
Everyone is dead.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.075
Film at 11:00.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.078
They just come to me naturally.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.206
Being zombie messiah
wasn't enough for you?

21:30.289 --> 21:32.041
Now you want to anchor
the six o'clock news?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.334
Action News, Doc.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.627
Well, don't get the flop sweats.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.670
Hey, hey, hey, Doc. Work the teleprompter.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.759
-How's that?
-[clears throat]

21:41.842 --> 21:42.676
I'm Jack Kingman.

21:42.760 --> 21:46.013
We interrupt this program
for an Action 9 News special report.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.641
The crash of Midwest Air Flight 409...

21:48.724 --> 21:50.810
<i>Our own Mike Renfro
has just returned from the site</i>

21:50.893 --> 21:52.520
<i>of this disaster. Mike?</i>

21:52.603 --> 21:54.605
[zombies growling]

21:56.649 --> 21:57.942
Hey, guys!

21:58.400 --> 22:00.945
Guys, I need a little help here.
Renfro is hurt.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.112
I'm OK. I'm not bad.

22:02.196 --> 22:04.240
I need some help here! Come on!

22:04.323 --> 22:05.491
Intern, get him some water.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.868
Everyone is going insane.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.037
-What do you mean, everyone?
-Everyone out there.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.873
-You're bleeding.
-Some dude just bit Renfro.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.042
Get the first aid kit.
What? Somebody bit him?

22:15.918 --> 22:17.044
The survivors from the crash,

22:17.127 --> 22:19.296
they were burned so bad, but they...

22:19.380 --> 22:21.507
-They were in shock.
-I don't think so, man!

22:21.590 --> 22:25.094
They bit Mike! I'm the one in shock.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.722
Mobs, looting. People need to stay inside.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.683
Survivors, not safe.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.601
-You good to go on?
-Hell, yeah.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.437
OK. We go live in two minutes.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.816
You're so professional.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.861
Maybe we should take him to the hospital.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.446
Nah, this will fix him up
just fine for now.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.578
Oh, boy.
Renfro is looking really rough, isn't he?

22:50.661 --> 22:52.454
Brutal. Absolutely brutal.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.790
-I just hope he's OK.
-Yeah.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.041
Everybody settle, please.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.796
I'm Jack Kingman.

23:00.879 --> 23:05.259
We interrupt this program
for an Action News 9 special report.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.762
The crash of Midwest Air Flight 409...

23:08.846 --> 23:10.514
I'm Carly McFadden.

23:10.598 --> 23:14.768
Our own Mike Renfro has just returned
from the site of this disaster.

23:16.186 --> 23:19.773
Mike, tell us in your own words
what you saw at the crash site.

23:23.652 --> 23:26.322
Mike, I know this was
a harrowing experience for you,

23:26.405 --> 23:29.533
so try to collect yourself,
if you can, and tell us

23:29.617 --> 23:34.455
what it was like seeing those passengers
emerge from the wreckage

23:34.538 --> 23:36.040
of Midwest Air Flight 409?

23:38.584 --> 23:41.670
Mike? Can you tell us what you saw?

23:42.838 --> 23:45.090
-[retches]
-[screams]

23:47.676 --> 23:50.929
-[groans]
-[continues screaming] Oh my G...!

23:51.013 --> 23:53.724
Uh, we will check back with Mike?

23:53.807 --> 23:56.060
Can we get a medic? This man is ill.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.812
Sweet lord! Mike? Talk to me, buddy.

23:58.896 --> 24:01.815
-[screaming]
-[crunching]

24:01.899 --> 24:04.818
[commotion]

24:09.782 --> 24:12.660
Oh, good Lord. Go to a commercial.

24:12.743 --> 24:15.162
Public service announcement. Even a promo.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.373
Get security in here quick!

24:18.248 --> 24:22.419
State authorities have instituted
a curfew effective immediately.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.630
Everyone is urged to stay indoors.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.216
It is unclear how the violent mob behavior

24:27.299 --> 24:30.761
is related to the crash
of Midwest Air Flight 409.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.846
-[commotion continues]
-Uh...

24:35.432 --> 24:37.226
Get the first aid kit!

24:41.105 --> 24:45.693
We will continue to bring you
team coverage as this story develops.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.069
Come on, we got to go.

24:47.152 --> 24:50.531
As this story develops.
I'm Carly McFadden. Be safe.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.907
Action News 9.

24:57.413 --> 25:00.332
[growling]

25:01.166 --> 25:03.377
Oh, my God. What is happening, Doug?

25:03.460 --> 25:04.962
You know my name?

25:05.045 --> 25:07.047
Focus! What happened to Renfro?

25:07.131 --> 25:09.216
Uh, I think he turned into a zombie.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.260
-What? No!
-I don't know.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.511
Come on!

25:16.056 --> 25:17.808
We need to get to the roof!

25:18.350 --> 25:20.060
And also grab a camera.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.731
[faint growling and screaming]

25:38.078 --> 25:39.538
[growling]

25:39.621 --> 25:42.166
Uh... Oh, Renfro.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.293
Easy. We're gonna get you some help.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.254
Antibiotics. That is what you need.
Some antibiotics.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.839
We're gonna get that for you.

25:48.922 --> 25:52.426
Damn, Bruce.
Is this about the contract renegotiation?

25:52.509 --> 25:53.385
Remember this, sir.

25:53.469 --> 25:56.138
I have won nine local Emmys
for this station.

25:56.221 --> 26:00.476
Nine, nine of them, nine.
And I'm the face of the station.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.895
No offense. I mean you're important too,
Renfro. You really are.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.773
That series you did on the homeless,
I mean, that was great.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.817
I couldn't have been down there
for a week like that with those people!

26:08.901 --> 26:11.236
[screaming]

26:32.549 --> 26:33.884
That was weird!

26:34.718 --> 26:36.053
What was weird?

26:38.096 --> 26:40.265
You OK? It's all clear back there.

26:40.349 --> 26:41.809
What do you got there, 10K?

26:41.892 --> 26:42.976
It says it's an Emmy.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.521
I'd like to thank my good friend Doc,

26:45.604 --> 26:47.231
who believed in me when no one else would.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.817
Yeah, keep it short, Murphy.
It's a local Emmy.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.652
You guys are wasting electricity.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.612
It's not me.
It came on when everything else did.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.824
It was on. This place went down
during a newscast.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.285
-Man, that'd be a hell of a blooper reel.
-[Murphy] Mm.

27:00.369 --> 27:01.203
Murphy, look out!

27:02.955 --> 27:03.956
Catch!

27:08.544 --> 27:11.213
Well, I guess now we know
what a local Emmy is good for.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.673
That Z went right for Murphy.

27:12.756 --> 27:13.924
Nice blazer.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.385
I think you were sitting
in his anchor chair, Murphy.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.053
Let's go find Warren.

27:18.136 --> 27:21.932
I do not want to meet the rest
of the award-winning Action News Team.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.107
That's the old server farm.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.817
Nothing in there can be remotely accessed.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.319
Could we re-route the power?
At least shut everything down?

27:34.403 --> 27:36.321
-Lock 'em out that way?
-That could work.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.031
Or we could drop these two
and then go mano a mano.

27:38.115 --> 27:39.449
They're messing with my family.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.285
There are four or five more soldiers

27:41.368 --> 27:43.954
and the one creepy dude, the HMFWIC.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.455
HMFWIC?

27:45.539 --> 27:47.249
Head Mother...

27:47.332 --> 27:48.750
What's-In-Charge.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.420
[Kaya] The man with the plan.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.088
The man with the plan.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.631
The head of the snake.

27:55.173 --> 27:58.552
Why did he travel from a secure paradise
to a apocalyptic wasteland?

27:58.635 --> 28:00.137
Nothing good, I'm betting.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.471
[zombie growls]

28:01.555 --> 28:03.599
Oh, no. Scampy.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.310
Scampy? Who's Scampy?

28:06.393 --> 28:08.729
Scampy's the Z
that tracked me for 200 miles.

28:08.812 --> 28:11.106
I named him Scampy to make it less freaky.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.482
I thought I lost the guy.

28:12.566 --> 28:14.276
I pinned him to a tree with that pipe.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.154
Dude won't die.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.572
He's a Mad Z.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.616
A Mad Z?

28:20.699 --> 28:25.662
Yeah. I picked up a lot of unconfirmed
radio traffic about unkillable Zs.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.456
Virus mutated. Can't mercy 'em.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.754
What in the-- What?

28:36.506 --> 28:39.051
I know. It's a real bummer.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.221
So they're unkillable?
That explains a lot.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.181
[gunfire continues]

28:53.398 --> 28:55.692
-Here comes your friend.
-He's not my friend.

28:55.776 --> 28:58.153
He's more like an acquaintance
I keep murdering. Let's go.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.615
Dude is nothing if not persistent.

29:01.698 --> 29:04.284
We have to get back to Nana and JZ.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.287
Where'd that thing go?

29:07.371 --> 29:08.747
I think we lost him.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.921
So these new zombies are smart too?

29:16.004 --> 29:17.923
Smarter than your average Z.

29:21.218 --> 29:22.928
Let's just hope we're a little smarter.

29:32.479 --> 29:33.772
What's up, Scampy?

29:34.481 --> 29:36.233
Sorry about the whole pipe-in-tree thing.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.906
We have to lead him away from JZ.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.534
Easy. Everybody be cool.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.662
Run!

30:05.095 --> 30:06.471
Do you think we lost it?

30:06.555 --> 30:09.683
For someone who has survived
seven years of the Zombie Apocalypse,

30:09.766 --> 30:11.810
you are ridiculously optimistic.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.937
-[chuckles]
-And I love that about you.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.899
-[growling]
-That was nice.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.043
-Simon, what are you doing?
-Trust me!

30:38.879 --> 30:39.713
Get back.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.846
-Simon, come on.
-Dammit.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.389
Get back!

30:50.140 --> 30:50.974
Wait.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.768
-Simon, no!
-Come on.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.354
Get away from him!

30:55.771 --> 30:56.605
Simon!

31:13.163 --> 31:14.039
[wet thud]

31:16.541 --> 31:18.835
Come on. Is this for real?

31:26.593 --> 31:27.677
What do you want?

31:27.761 --> 31:30.055
[zombie continues growling]

31:34.518 --> 31:35.685
Come on, Simon.

31:37.771 --> 31:38.980
Still no signal?

31:39.481 --> 31:40.440
It won't track.

31:40.524 --> 31:41.942
Something's jacked up
between here and there.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.819
We'll have to track directly off the dish.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.530
I guess we're going to the roof.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.575
[gasps]

31:51.618 --> 31:52.577
In here.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.499
Come quick. Help me!

31:57.582 --> 32:00.752
[Muzak playing]

32:02.295 --> 32:03.713
-Are they coming?
-I don't know.

32:03.797 --> 32:05.006
Well, what are we gonna do?

32:05.090 --> 32:06.883
Give me a minute, Doug.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.516
We can make the hallway
really slippery for those things.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.144
-Get more toilet paper!
-OK, yeah.

32:17.227 --> 32:18.603
Wait!

32:18.687 --> 32:21.982
-[growling]
-[screaming]

32:27.028 --> 32:28.864
Stop it, Helen. Stop it.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.449
Stop it, Helen, stop!

32:40.250 --> 32:41.418
Oh, my God, Helen.

32:42.544 --> 32:43.795
Oh, my God.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.054
Oh, no, no, no. Dougie, not you.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.289
I think that's the quickest way
to the roof.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.626
We got to get up to that dish
before the generator dies.

33:22.709 --> 33:23.710
[sighs]

33:23.793 --> 33:25.587
[growling]

33:33.345 --> 33:35.972
All the Zona soldiers
could've turned Mad Z by now.

33:36.056 --> 33:39.518
You have to be smart,
not just impossibly brave.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.978
I didn't make it back all this way
to die in front of you.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.272
Come here.

33:48.735 --> 33:49.569
Wow.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.155
Two years away and you're a better kisser.

33:52.614 --> 33:53.448
Yeah.

33:53.532 --> 33:57.202
Well, absence makes the heart grow
something something.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.790
I'll kill the power to the server farms
and back up what I can.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.876
You capture the HMF and make him talk.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.253
Done and done.

34:14.261 --> 34:15.679
I love that man.

34:25.855 --> 34:27.399
Murphy, are you with us?

34:28.358 --> 34:30.068
Overrun 'em to the stairs.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.070
Haul ass.

34:54.801 --> 34:58.013
[man] <i>Weather girl.
Weather girl. Come back.</i>

34:58.096 --> 34:59.264
<i>Chopper 9 is on approach.</i>

35:08.523 --> 35:11.818
Chopper 9, Chopper 9. I'm here.
I'm coming. I'm here!

35:25.957 --> 35:27.375
The control room.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.632
-Momma's got to go out.
-[cocks gun]

35:38.136 --> 35:40.096
[zombie growling]

36:05.955 --> 36:07.999
I'm Kaya-in-the-Sky-A.

36:08.083 --> 36:11.002
And you're in the wrong
control room, Buster.

36:21.471 --> 36:22.305
Well...

36:28.311 --> 36:29.938
Do I have your attention?

36:30.021 --> 36:33.441
This is the part where you tell me
who you are and what you're doing here.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.194
Who I am is of no consequence.

36:36.277 --> 36:39.572
But I can assure you my errand here
is of critical importance.

36:39.656 --> 36:41.366
Importance to whom?

36:43.952 --> 36:45.578
[distant gun blast]

36:45.662 --> 36:46.538
Simon.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.207
[gunfire]

36:50.500 --> 36:52.377
You sit right there!

36:52.460 --> 36:53.670
It's time for me to go.

36:53.753 --> 36:54.754
I mean it.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.718
Don't you move!

37:46.055 --> 37:49.100
[helicopter engine starts]

37:57.567 --> 37:59.611
We have to figure out
what he was looking for.

38:00.737 --> 38:02.822
I had him. I let him go.

38:02.906 --> 38:03.948
I'm sorry.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.659
Kaya, you saved my life.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.789
OK. You owe me one then.

38:14.918 --> 38:17.962
-[distant alarms blaring]
-[car horns honking]

38:19.422 --> 38:21.841
Chopper 9, I'm at the landing pad.

38:24.594 --> 38:26.513
Chopper 9, you're my only way out.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.974
[man] <i>Copy you, Carly.
I'm inbound. Five minutes.</i>

38:32.435 --> 38:35.021
Copy you, Gus. I'll be here.

39:02.298 --> 39:06.386
We interrupt this program to bring you
an Action News 9 special report.

39:06.469 --> 39:07.720
This is Carly McFadden,

39:07.804 --> 39:11.599
broadcasting from atop
the Action News 9 Broadcast Center.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.644
The news team is dead,
or something, whatever they are.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.522
The crash of Midwest Air Flight 409

39:17.605 --> 39:20.900
pales against this epidemic of death
we all now face.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.030
As a broadcast professional,

39:26.114 --> 39:29.158
I will provide updates
for as long as I can.

39:29.242 --> 39:30.535
Take care of each other.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.246
That's all we can do now. Be safe.

39:33.329 --> 39:36.666
This is Carly McFadden, Action News 9.

39:36.749 --> 39:40.003
[helicopter approaches]

39:48.052 --> 39:49.721
There you are, Chopper 9.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.398
Keep 'em off the roof!

40:00.481 --> 40:01.858
You got it, chief.

40:01.941 --> 40:05.111
-What about that?
-Yeah. That com box looks accessible.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.613
Let's make a long distance phone call.

40:06.696 --> 40:08.865
[pounding on door]

40:15.830 --> 40:17.916
-Warren!
-[growling]

40:29.427 --> 40:30.929
Where did she come from?

40:31.012 --> 40:32.931
The door was barricaded from this side.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.933
She's the only Z up here.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.268
She died all alone on this roof.

40:44.317 --> 40:45.610
I give you mercy.

40:49.197 --> 40:51.074
So that's where
the rotor blades came from.

40:52.909 --> 40:55.620
She was waiting for Chopper 9
to rescue her.

40:56.663 --> 40:58.873
That is harsh.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.681
Whatever was on these disks
was wiped clean.

41:14.764 --> 41:17.016
He transferred all the data
to a hard drive.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.647
Anything recoverable?

41:24.190 --> 41:26.025
Nothing. Empty shells.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.820
[woman] <i>Camp Northern Light?</i>

41:28.903 --> 41:31.531
<i>Kaya? Operation Bitemark calling.
Come back.</i>

41:31.614 --> 41:32.573
Warren?

41:33.616 --> 41:36.494
<i>Operation Bitemark
for Camp Northern Light. Do you copy?</i>

41:37.078 --> 41:39.163
[Citizen Z] <i>Hey, Warren.
It's me, Citizen Z.</i>

41:39.247 --> 41:41.666
I'm here with Kaya-in-the-Sky-A. Over.

41:42.166 --> 41:45.753
Citizen Z. We heard Kaya's Mayday.
Is she OK?

41:45.837 --> 41:47.296
She is now that Simon's home.

41:49.132 --> 41:50.341
<i>Let me tell you,</i>

41:50.425 --> 41:52.051
that makes our day.

41:52.593 --> 41:54.053
Listen. I've been off the air a long time.

41:54.137 --> 41:56.931
What's the status of Operation Bitemark?
Where's Murphy?

41:57.473 --> 41:59.225
How's Addy and the rest of the crew?

42:01.060 --> 42:04.480
<i>We lost contact with Addy. Lucy is dead.</i>

42:04.564 --> 42:08.943
Doc and 10K are with me.
And Murphy and I escaped Zona together.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.820
Zona? You were on Zona?

42:11.696 --> 42:12.739
That's a roger.

42:13.614 --> 42:16.451
Zona soldiers just attacked us.
They stole files.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.494
Zona? Are you sure?

42:19.579 --> 42:21.914
Files? What did they take, exactly?

42:21.998 --> 42:23.791
Not sure. They covered their tracks.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.585
They were after old floppy disks.

42:25.668 --> 42:28.463
We're not sure what was on the disks.
They were damaged.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.174
All we know is the name
of the label on the files.

42:31.924 --> 42:32.800
Black Rainbow.

42:33.593 --> 42:34.552
Black Rainbow?

42:37.055 --> 42:38.556
Black Rainbow is real.
