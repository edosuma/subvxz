00:34.034 --> 00:37.246
( distant wolves howling )

00:54.513 --> 00:57.724
( static crackling )

00:57.808 --> 01:01.478
Nate:
<i>This is Dave, our props guy.</i>

01:01.561 --> 01:03.981
<i>Say hi, Dave. All right.</i>

01:06.942 --> 01:09.903
<i>And this is our</i>
<i>awesome cameraman, Chris.</i>

01:09.987 --> 01:13.031
‐ <i>What's going on, Chris?</i>
‐ ...milk the climax.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.533
Nate:
<i>Here are the stars of our show.</i>

01:14.616 --> 01:15.909
I get it, but it's not
just your decision.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.452
And that was the part
that I wrote.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.204
So it would be nice
if you could just‐‐

01:19.288 --> 01:21.748
How's this looking?

01:21.832 --> 01:24.209
Looking good, Camille.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.712
<i>( indistinct</i>
<i>background chatter )</i>

01:26.795 --> 01:28.046
You know, we could have

01:28.130 --> 01:30.299
talked about this
just between us.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.842
Everybody didn't
need to hear that.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.176
Hey, is this working?

01:33.260 --> 01:34.303
‐ Nate: <i>Yeah.</i>
‐ Yes?

01:34.386 --> 01:36.388
Ooh. Let's take that
and shoot

01:36.471 --> 01:38.390
some of those
segments outdoors.

01:38.473 --> 01:39.558
Great zombie intro.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.019
‐ Yes, yes, yes.
‐ Yes. Yes. Nice.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.103
Hang on to that, Jerry.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.191
Robert: ...odd.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.154
Nina:
<i>So how old are you here?</i>

01:53.238 --> 01:56.908
I mean,
this is, uh, 1974,

01:56.992 --> 01:59.661
so... 25.

02:00.662 --> 02:04.166
How did you
get this footage?

02:04.249 --> 02:05.751
Where did you find‐‐

02:05.834 --> 02:08.795
Oh, a ton of this stuff
is up on YouTube now.

02:11.006 --> 02:14.176
So these were the early days
of "Night Shift," right?

02:14.259 --> 02:18.472
Yes. Yes, Robert and I were
just out of community college,

02:18.555 --> 02:23.435
and the station had
these new portable cameras,
and we set our minds‐‐

02:23.518 --> 02:25.520
Sorry. Uh, wait.
Sorry.

02:26.605 --> 02:27.648
Sorry, sorry.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.486
OK. You can keep going.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.365
Um, aren't you writing
an article

02:36.448 --> 02:38.283
in addition
to the radio interview?

02:38.367 --> 02:40.494
Yeah. I'll do
a short written piece

02:40.577 --> 02:42.079
to go along with the podcast.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.497
Oh! Um...

02:46.541 --> 02:47.918
would you mind?

02:48.001 --> 02:51.546
I'm such a huge fan of yours.
My dad grew up on you.

02:51.630 --> 02:55.092
We watched as many
of your episodes
as we could find.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.970
You guys were the greatest.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.848
And I wasn't even expecting
you to be in character.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.456
Why are you finally
talking to me now?

03:28.708 --> 03:34.089
You can only keep things
buried so long

03:34.172 --> 03:37.217
before they... rise up.

03:42.764 --> 03:43.932
You know,
I honestly thought

03:44.015 --> 03:47.227
that you'd look,
like, way older.

03:48.770 --> 03:52.691
So, uh, "Night Shift"
was born in 1972,

03:52.774 --> 03:55.026
and it ran
for a few years, and‐‐

03:55.110 --> 03:57.070
Excuse me one moment.
Sorry. Please.

04:04.453 --> 04:05.829
Yeah, sure.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.468
‐ ( door opens )
‐ Oh. ( chuckles softly )

05:01.551 --> 05:02.677
Thanks.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.390
( cabinet opens )

05:08.600 --> 05:09.726
( sighs )

05:15.899 --> 05:18.235
This is for you.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.278
The wine is...

05:20.362 --> 05:21.488
strong.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.033
You'll have to
forgive my tastes.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.876
Do you mind if we start
from the beginning?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.628
Yes, yes. Uh‐‐

05:36.711 --> 05:38.839
How did this all happen?

05:38.922 --> 05:42.801
Well, it was Robert and I

05:42.884 --> 05:45.387
since we were kids,
and, um...

05:46.680 --> 05:48.640
we grew up
in the middle of nowhere

05:48.723 --> 05:52.727
with nothing
but our imaginations,

05:52.811 --> 05:54.104
keep us from insane,

05:54.187 --> 05:57.065
and we put on little plays
in my bedroom

05:57.148 --> 06:01.361
and record radio shows
in middle school‐‐

06:01.444 --> 06:02.487
‐ Wow.
‐ And in high school,

06:02.571 --> 06:03.738
we performed plays

06:03.822 --> 06:05.657
for our friends in garages,

06:05.740 --> 06:10.161
in the graveyards,
in the forests after dark.

06:10.245 --> 06:13.164
Then, when we went
to community college,

06:13.248 --> 06:14.958
we started working
at the TV station,

06:15.041 --> 06:17.502
and we were the only ones
with enough spare time

06:17.586 --> 06:19.546
to, uh,
learn the new equipment,

06:19.629 --> 06:22.674
and there was so much
dead air after midnight

06:22.757 --> 06:24.676
that they eventually
offered us

06:24.759 --> 06:27.596
what they referred to as...

06:28.888 --> 06:29.806
the night shift.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.099
( chuckle )

06:31.182 --> 06:34.519
And that's really
when Robert and I

06:34.603 --> 06:36.521
truly became
each other's everything.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.648
I mean, we cracked
each other up,

06:38.732 --> 06:39.774
we terrified each other,

06:39.858 --> 06:41.026
we put on little comedy skits

06:41.109 --> 06:42.819
about horror movies
and vice versa.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.321
They blended together
perfectly.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.698
Horror, monsters, demon jokes,

06:46.781 --> 06:48.908
terror, slapstick, all of it.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.119
By the time school ended,

06:51.202 --> 06:53.830
we'd kind of gotten
a bit of a following,

06:53.913 --> 06:57.375
so we were still hanging
around the TV station,

06:57.459 --> 06:59.794
and the late night crew
we had was hilarious.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.380
And so we dreamt up
our own night shift

07:02.464 --> 07:04.215
and started showing movies

07:04.299 --> 07:06.676
with our own short films
after midnight.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.304
It was‐‐ it was‐‐
that was our dream,

07:09.387 --> 07:13.308
and we just‐‐ it just, uh‐‐

07:14.559 --> 07:16.269
Yeah. We, um...

07:18.063 --> 07:20.148
Why did it stop?

07:22.776 --> 07:26.696
You know, we were...
we were kids, and...

07:29.449 --> 07:31.660
boys will be boys.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.290
What does that mean,
boys will be boys?

07:55.016 --> 07:57.477
I don't have to
tell you anything.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.661
( knock on door )

08:30.385 --> 08:32.762
( wind howling )

08:43.231 --> 08:44.190
Robert.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.947
Hello, Darkness.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.205
My old friend.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.249
( soft chuckle )

09:08.548 --> 09:12.093
Oh, hello. It's lovely
to see you again.

09:13.511 --> 09:14.929
Nina:
<i>It's good to see you, too.</i>

09:17.515 --> 09:20.560
Nina reached out
to me last year.

09:20.643 --> 09:24.022
She wants to tell our story
to everyone who loved the show,

09:24.105 --> 09:28.151
and she asked me to come here
and to see you again.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.032
We didn't tell you
because, well,

09:34.115 --> 09:36.785
I knew you'd never agree
to see me otherwise.

09:46.961 --> 09:47.921
Stop!

09:53.635 --> 09:58.306
I have crossed oceans
to reunite with you,
my old friend.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.476
I have always known
that destiny

10:01.559 --> 10:03.186
would bring us
back together,

10:03.269 --> 10:05.772
and tonight seems
to be the night.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.153
As you yourself once said...

10:13.404 --> 10:18.118
"Should she come knocking
at my door..."

10:21.830 --> 10:26.626
"...who am I to deny
a date with Destiny?"

10:40.473 --> 10:43.893
OK. So, as far
as I understand,

10:43.977 --> 10:46.729
the show officially
started in 1972,

10:46.813 --> 10:50.191
but by 1975,
it just stopped.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.318
So what happened?

10:52.402 --> 10:54.154
Seems you already
know our story.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.238
His side at least.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.448
OK, I know some of it,
not all of it.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.868
But I haven't heard
anything from you.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.831
With your permission?

11:04.914 --> 11:06.583
You certainly don't
need my permission.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.877
( scoffs ) Jesus. There was
a time when I couldn't even

11:08.960 --> 11:11.546
address the crew
without consulting Robert
or he'd lose it!

11:11.629 --> 11:13.339
Nina: <i>Wow.</i>
<i>That must've been difficult.</i>

11:13.423 --> 11:16.593
I'd say it was
beyond difficult.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.636
Um, I see, but you did

11:18.720 --> 11:23.266
describe this
as a perfect match.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.727
Yeah, we were. We were...

11:26.811 --> 11:28.062
for a time.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.565
Until 1975.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.774
Until...

11:33.359 --> 11:35.278
Until Camille.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.990
I'm allowed to say her name.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.325
I loved her, too.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.868
<i>Love? Love?!</i>

11:41.951 --> 11:43.745
I think you and I

11:43.828 --> 11:45.663
have very different notions
of what love is.

11:45.747 --> 11:51.544
Love does not end because
14,558 days have passed.

11:51.628 --> 11:54.005
Not when you drive
an ocean between people.

11:54.088 --> 11:58.218
It only makes it stronger.
Fortified by time, distance.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.930
Even death
cannot destroy love.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.100
( sighs )

12:18.112 --> 12:21.282
40 years, and now you want
to share a drink with me?

12:23.117 --> 12:24.869
Why don't you pour me one?

12:24.953 --> 12:28.414
I don't think you can handle
the wine I drink, old friend.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.167
‐ Really?
‐ Yes, really.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.502
( each scoffs )

12:41.010 --> 12:44.472
Not bad, not bad,
not bad at all.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.476
<i>( Ted chuckles )</i>

12:50.478 --> 12:54.857
‐ Ugh. Pardon me.
‐ ( Ted chuckles )

12:54.941 --> 12:56.484
That's not
supposed to be funny.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.860
I know, but it was.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.363
I'd appreciate it
if you stopped laughing.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.447
( chuckles )

13:01.531 --> 13:03.366
Hey, fuck you.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.410
Excuse me.
I'm‐I'm sorry.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.286
I'm just‐‐

13:07.370 --> 13:09.539
Let me tell you something,
my old friend.

13:09.622 --> 13:15.420
I've not come here
bearing a festering hatred.

13:15.503 --> 13:19.215
I know not what you've
done with yourself
these many years...

13:20.508 --> 13:22.301
but I can only hope

13:22.385 --> 13:24.679
that they
have not been inhabited

13:24.762 --> 13:28.725
by a mere portion
of the regret and pain
that have filled mine.

13:30.685 --> 13:31.978
( sighs ) And if so,

13:32.061 --> 13:33.646
I offer you my
deepest sympathies‐‐

13:33.730 --> 13:35.273
It's not that simple.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.941
Yes, it is. I'm old.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.527
I don't have much time.
I'm choosing to take a chance.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.487
You can't just turn back time.

13:41.571 --> 13:42.864
Oh, come on.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.158
‐ My God, you are so stubborn.
‐ No, I'm not.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.492
As stubborn
as you've ever been.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.453
You're like a...
lonely old man.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.621
You've got nothing,
you got nobody.

13:50.705 --> 13:51.664
Who's fault is that?

13:51.748 --> 13:52.790
Well, it's not mine,

13:52.874 --> 13:54.125
and don't put that all on me.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.877
‐ Oh?
‐ I accept my part.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.545
‐ But you‐‐
‐ Me?!

13:57.628 --> 14:00.548
I acted out of love
and dedication,

14:00.631 --> 14:02.091
and if I am a lonely old man

14:02.175 --> 14:05.970
<i>with nothing and no one,</i>
<i>then it's because you‐‐</i>

14:06.054 --> 14:08.097
I was just a boy,
a scared boy!

14:08.181 --> 14:09.265
I didn't understand!

14:09.348 --> 14:11.476
You were a man!
You were a man!

14:11.559 --> 14:12.977
You were everything
I wanted to be!

14:13.061 --> 14:14.479
You had it all!

14:14.562 --> 14:15.813
And you took the one thing

14:15.897 --> 14:17.648
that I had that you didn't!

14:17.732 --> 14:20.777
I didn't take anything!
She was a grown woman!

14:20.860 --> 14:22.487
Robert:
<i>She made a choice! Camille‐‐</i>

14:22.570 --> 14:24.906
I gave up my life
as I know it!

14:24.989 --> 14:26.866
‐ Whoa, whoa, whoa!
‐ Ted: <i>You stepped right in!</i>

14:26.949 --> 14:31.662
Whoa. OK, just settle down.

14:31.746 --> 14:32.997
I get it.

14:33.081 --> 14:37.001
She came between you
and ended the show,

14:37.085 --> 14:39.545
<i>and I'm guessing</i>
<i>your friendship.</i>

14:39.629 --> 14:41.672
But I've been
through break‐ups,

14:41.756 --> 14:46.260
and eventually you just‐‐
you move on.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.179
I just can't believe
after 40 years

14:48.262 --> 14:50.973
<i>this is still so charged.</i>

14:51.057 --> 14:53.935
( sighs )

14:54.018 --> 14:55.436
So what really happened?

14:57.438 --> 15:01.275
Well, when Camille
joined the show,

15:01.359 --> 15:02.944
she instantly fell
in love with Ted,

15:03.027 --> 15:04.779
our fearless leader.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.405
I can't say I blame her,

15:06.489 --> 15:09.575
even as I held a flame
for her myself.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.245
But I realized,

15:12.328 --> 15:13.996
since Ted had Camille,

15:14.080 --> 15:16.457
that he really didn't
need me anymore.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.169
And I was terrified.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.297
I was angry whenever
you disagreed with me.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.716
I felt that everything
was changing,

15:25.800 --> 15:28.261
and that I was falling apart.

15:29.804 --> 15:34.183
And then, one night,
Camille came to see me

15:34.267 --> 15:38.354
to tell me the secret
that she alone had harbored.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.107
That she had been...

15:41.190 --> 15:43.151
bitten.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.195
Bitten?

15:48.322 --> 15:51.492
This secret that she held
was driving a wedge

15:51.576 --> 15:54.078
between her and Ted.

15:54.162 --> 15:57.874
And I encouraged her
to tell him.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.876
And I built up her confidence

15:59.959 --> 16:04.046
in spite of her changes.
And in doing so, we‐‐

16:04.130 --> 16:06.090
You two fell in love.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.341
It was an accident.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.177
We couldn't help
the way we felt.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.304
( scoffs )
You could've stepped aside

16:11.387 --> 16:12.889
instead of driving me insane,

16:12.972 --> 16:14.765
making me so terrified
of losing her

16:14.849 --> 16:16.559
that I would do anything
not to.

16:21.272 --> 16:25.693
( sighs ) She would
never agree to this.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.991
So, one day, as she slept...

16:33.868 --> 16:37.246
I put my bare neck
on her teeth,

16:37.330 --> 16:40.166
and I startled her
in her sleep.

16:40.249 --> 16:44.420
I felt her teeth
clench into my neck...

16:46.255 --> 16:48.716
locking our souls together
for eternity.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.263
But, uh, it was too late.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.142
She'd already fallen
in love with you.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.937
My best friend.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.939
You stole her from me,

17:03.022 --> 17:04.982
and you didn't even
have the courage

17:05.066 --> 17:06.651
to take the bite
and commit to her.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.903
I couldn't be the man
she wanted me to be.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.405
You stole her to get to me!

17:11.489 --> 17:15.284
And then you left her,
and then you abandoned us!

17:20.081 --> 17:23.501
I had a shot
at true happiness,

17:23.584 --> 17:25.628
and all of it's gone.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.882
Gone... because of you.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.639
All I can say is I'm sorry.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.809
And I miss you.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.062
And I wanna be
your friend again.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.650
For as long as I have left.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.469
( screaming )

18:28.524 --> 18:31.277
Open it! Now!

18:38.200 --> 18:39.368
( hissing )

18:45.583 --> 18:46.751
Go!

18:46.834 --> 18:49.587
I can't control myself!

18:49.670 --> 18:51.756
( grunts )

18:51.839 --> 18:55.259
( growling )

18:55.343 --> 18:57.637
( groans )

19:01.015 --> 19:01.932
( grunts )

19:02.016 --> 19:03.726
( breathing heavily )

19:03.809 --> 19:06.228
You dumbass!

19:08.689 --> 19:10.566
( grunts )

19:10.650 --> 19:11.901
( choking )

19:11.984 --> 19:13.944
Oh, my God.

19:14.028 --> 19:17.657
No! Oh, God. No.

19:17.740 --> 19:18.908
Sorry.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.159
‐ Go!
‐ ( Nina screams )

19:20.242 --> 19:21.702
( choking )

19:24.080 --> 19:27.375
( softly ) No, no, no.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.752
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.380
‐ My old friend. No!
‐ ( choking )

19:40.638 --> 19:43.265
So good.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.685
I always wondered.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.645
What have I done?

19:47.728 --> 19:49.438
I'm so sorry.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.650
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.777
I just‐‐
all these years wasted.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.905
‐ It's‐‐ it's OK.
‐ ( breathing heavily )

19:57.988 --> 20:02.535
Just being able
to see you again‐‐

20:02.618 --> 20:06.205
it was worth it.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.957
It was worth it.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.126
( stammering )
It's not too late.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.919
It's not too late.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.051
Do... do you trust me?

20:20.594 --> 20:22.513
‐ Yes.
‐ Do you trust me?

20:22.596 --> 20:24.598
Do you wanna be together?

20:24.682 --> 20:26.058
Always.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.145
Say the words with me, then.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.273
"Hello, Darkness."

20:33.399 --> 20:35.609
Hello, Darkness.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.239
"My old friend."

20:47.204 --> 20:49.498
( gnawing loudly )

21:05.014 --> 21:07.308
( wind howling )

21:15.649 --> 21:19.653
( distant coyote howling )

21:26.535 --> 21:28.829
How are you supposed
to cut him down with that?

21:34.001 --> 21:36.253
‐ Be sure to hang around...
‐ <i>( laughter )</i>

21:36.337 --> 21:40.466
...for the thrilling
conclusion of "So You
Think You Can Scream."

21:40.549 --> 21:43.427
( laughing continues )

21:43.511 --> 21:46.055
‐ Robert: Not bad.
‐ Ted: Yeah. Pretty good.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.141
( Ted and Robert laugh )

21:49.225 --> 21:50.267
Oh, man.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.685
This is pretty awful, though.

21:51.769 --> 21:53.270
Yeah, you have to
get used to it,

21:53.354 --> 21:54.730
otherwise you're gonna
have to, um‐‐

21:54.814 --> 21:55.898
( knock on door )

21:55.981 --> 21:57.358
Woman: <i>Housekeeping!</i>

21:58.692 --> 22:00.945
( chainsaw revs,
man screams on television )

22:01.028 --> 22:02.780
( TV turns off )

22:02.863 --> 22:04.865
‐ Come in!
‐ Come in!

23:12.182 --> 23:13.601
MAN:
<i>I work for the devil.</i>

23:14.518 --> 23:15.519
<i>I'm more of an...</i>

23:15.603 --> 23:18.063
<i>executive assistant</i>
<i>to the devil.</i>

23:20.691 --> 23:24.278
Now, when you talk about hell,
what do you mean exactly?

23:24.361 --> 23:25.404
Would you like to see a preview?

23:25.487 --> 23:26.405
ELDERLY WOMAN: A preview?

23:26.822 --> 23:29.283
