00:27.027 --> 00:28.028
Hey, what time is it?

00:30.098 --> 00:31.432
It's meat party time!

00:31.532 --> 00:32.733
I'll take one steak!

00:32.833 --> 00:35.736
One?
I got steaks for days!

00:35.836 --> 00:37.871
-Yeah!
-Bratwurst, please.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.573
More like "brat-best".

00:41.175 --> 00:43.077
And a burger of the turkey.

00:43.177 --> 00:46.414
Burger!
Gobble-gobble-gone!

00:46.514 --> 00:49.750
Hey, bro.
Throw my veggies
on that grill!

00:49.850 --> 00:52.086
Veggies?
On my beautiful grill?

00:52.186 --> 00:53.754
Are you crazy?

00:53.854 --> 00:57.725
You just ate
vegetables yesterday.
Why would you want more?

00:57.825 --> 01:01.028
I'm a vegetarian.
That's what I eat every day.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.697
Here, eat this sausage.
It's shaped like a carrot.

01:03.797 --> 01:04.965
Ew! No way!

01:05.065 --> 01:06.434
You're really missing out.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.868
The meat is so delicious...

01:07.968 --> 01:10.904
No more talking!
I need meat in my tum-tum.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.445
Come on, guys, vegetables!

01:17.545 --> 01:19.880
They're good,
and good for you.

01:24.118 --> 01:27.087
I'm just saying.
You might regret
eating all that meat.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.456
Nuh-uh. No way.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.158
No how, not a chance.

01:30.258 --> 01:31.825
Meat!

01:35.563 --> 01:38.031
It's Cinder Block.
He's attacking Jump City.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.734
You guys ready for
a meat

01:40.834 --> 01:42.002
Titans, go!

01:46.940 --> 01:49.977
Ow! Why does it
hurt so bad?

01:50.077 --> 01:52.246
One of my stomachs
and the meat are locked

01:52.346 --> 01:54.047
in a most ferocious struggle.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.685
The meat has won.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.020
Oh, there's a meat
person in me.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.290
What's your name,
little meat person?

02:03.591 --> 02:05.326
Can't think thoughts.
Only meat!

02:05.426 --> 02:06.627
I don't know what's worse,

02:06.727 --> 02:09.297
my meat gut
or my meat sweats!

02:09.397 --> 02:11.098
Don't worry.
I got this.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.236
He's so alert.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.407
So energetic!

02:21.008 --> 02:23.444
It's like he doesn't have
any meat in him at all!

02:29.850 --> 02:32.152
How were you
so focused and agile?

02:32.253 --> 02:36.257
All things are possible
through vegetables, bro.

02:36.357 --> 02:40.194
As you can see
from these science drawings

02:40.294 --> 02:43.664
vegetables make a line
that keeps going up.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.833
Yes, Cyborg?

02:45.933 --> 02:47.100
What's up with that
weird little purple carrot?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.771
That? That's a rutabaga.

02:50.871 --> 02:54.642
Oh, of course.
And that round,
leafy, green carrot?

02:54.742 --> 02:56.210
That's just lettuce.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.911
And the brown, lumpy carrot?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.247
The potato?

02:59.347 --> 03:01.549
You know, all vegetables
aren't just carrots, right?

03:01.649 --> 03:03.217
Then what's this
pointy, orange carrot?

03:03.317 --> 03:04.452
That's a carrot.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.119
I am so confused!

03:06.220 --> 03:09.022
This is a lot of information
to process, Beast Boy.

03:09.122 --> 03:12.360
But aren't vegetables still
just gross, tasteless
rabbit food?

03:12.460 --> 03:14.528
Yeah. Why should I
eat like a rabbit?

03:15.996 --> 03:17.265
I'm not a rabbit.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.467
It is true.
Vegetables do not
give my mouth

03:19.567 --> 03:22.670
the deliciousness
in the same manner
as the meat.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.639
You don't think vegetables
can be tasty, huh?

03:25.739 --> 03:27.675
For Robin, the carrot stew.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.777
Starfire, broccoli.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.713
Raven,
falafel and hummus.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.082
And Cyborg, spinach, bro!

03:54.067 --> 03:55.869
Whoa, that's good!

03:55.969 --> 03:56.937
Really good!

03:57.037 --> 03:59.273
I thought this would
taste like dirt.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.674
This don't taste like dirt!

04:03.010 --> 04:04.878
ALL: Vegetables!

04:25.132 --> 04:26.266
Crime alert!

04:26.367 --> 04:29.102
You guys ready for
a vegetable

04:31.238 --> 04:33.307
Oh, no!
It's the Titans!

04:33.407 --> 04:34.775
Go!

04:40.748 --> 04:44.017
Thanks to spinach
I'm stronger than ever!

04:48.088 --> 04:50.724
These carrots are
giving me super sight!

04:56.964 --> 04:58.231
I have so much
of the energy,

04:58.332 --> 05:00.868
I cannot believe it.
I just feel... Whoo!

05:02.069 --> 05:04.004
And I feel
happier than ever.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.279
That was amazing!

05:12.380 --> 05:15.616
Now do me a favor
and look under your shirts.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.958
Whoa! What's this?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.727
That's your vegetable gut.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.061
Now wipe your brows!

05:32.265 --> 05:34.067
What is this?

05:34.167 --> 05:36.169
-That's right, mama.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.906
You got some sweet
vegetable sweat going on!

05:39.006 --> 05:42.510
Then from this day on,
we will only eat the...

05:42.610 --> 05:44.512
ALL: Vegetables!

05:44.612 --> 05:45.913
That's what's up!

05:51.885 --> 05:53.854
Good morning, Beast Boy.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.624
Would you like some
scrambled vegetables?

05:56.724 --> 05:59.059
Or some toasted
vegetable slices?

05:59.159 --> 06:00.928
Or some vegetables
in a bowl?

06:01.028 --> 06:03.063
No milk though.
Only vegetables.

06:03.163 --> 06:06.299
What... I don't...
You're all green!

06:06.400 --> 06:07.735
We're vegetarians.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.803
Vegetarians don't turn green!

06:09.903 --> 06:11.138
You're green.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.807
Yeah, but for totally
different reasons.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.443
I think it's great
you're eating healthier,

06:15.543 --> 06:18.946
but you've gotta do
everything in moderation.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.514
What are you doing, Beast Boy?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.249
You can't eat that.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.617
It's just some fruit.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.086
And fruit is a type of meat.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.689
I don't know for sure,
but I don't think that's true.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.724
Is it the vegetable?

06:30.824 --> 06:33.026
-No.
-TITANS: He's eating meat.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.429
What should we do with him?

06:35.529 --> 06:37.431
Let's bring him to our master.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.199
Let him decide.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.569
Huh

06:41.669 --> 06:44.905
TITANS:
Vegetables! Vegetables!

06:45.005 --> 06:48.275
Vegetables! Vegetables!

06:48.375 --> 06:51.579
Vegetables! Vegetables!

06:51.679 --> 06:53.246
What are you guys doing?

06:53.346 --> 06:55.783
Ever since we ate
our first vegetable,

06:55.883 --> 06:57.485
he has been whispering to us.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.387
-Yes, he!

07:00.488 --> 07:04.124
If we do not defile
our bodies and eat
only vegetables,

07:04.224 --> 07:07.661
he will grant us a place
in his new vegetable kingdom.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.064
You guys are acting
super weird!

07:11.164 --> 07:13.801
I think maybe you ate
too many vegetables.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.504
Quiet! It is time.

07:16.604 --> 07:19.607
ALL:
Rhubarb, lettuce, lima beans,

07:19.707 --> 07:23.143
potato, peppers,
collared greens.

07:23.243 --> 07:26.647
We eat them all,
and then some more

07:26.747 --> 07:30.417
to summon our master,
Vegetor!

07:41.461 --> 07:43.731
From deep within the green,

07:43.831 --> 07:46.399
Vegetor has risen!

07:46.500 --> 07:50.437
I will cleanse this world
by destroying all meat.

07:50.538 --> 07:54.407
Starting with you,
filthy meat creature.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.921
Whoa!

08:08.021 --> 08:09.823
I'm a vegetarian, dude!

08:09.923 --> 08:12.492
Guys, you can't
let him destroy me!

08:12.593 --> 08:16.029
But there is no room for you
in the new vegetable kingdom.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.866
Look,
I think meat is gross.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.801
But other people like it,
and that's cool.

08:20.901 --> 08:24.104
You just need to
have a balanced diet
whatever you eat.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.775
His mind has been poisoned
by the meat apple.

08:27.875 --> 08:31.211
Cyborg,
dude, what time is it?

08:31.311 --> 08:33.046
I don't know.
I didn't bring a watch.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.282
What time is it?

08:35.382 --> 08:36.383
Six

08:36.483 --> 08:38.451
No! What time is it?

08:40.153 --> 08:42.022
It's meat party time!

08:45.125 --> 08:47.695
What?
-It's meat party time!

08:47.795 --> 08:49.429
Wait... What...

08:49.529 --> 08:51.832
Did someone say
"Meat party time"?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.668
Your time is up.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.805
The age of vegetables
begins now!

08:59.139 --> 09:02.209
Oh! What is that
captivating smell?

09:03.476 --> 09:05.679
Barbecue ribs, buddy.
Want some?

09:05.779 --> 09:07.948
Vegetor's body is a temple!

09:08.048 --> 09:10.150
He does not indulge
in such filth.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.285
Does smell pretty good.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.322
And the taste is
even better than the smell.

09:15.422 --> 09:18.491
Vegetor guesses
one bite couldn't hurt.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.473
Mmm. Not bad.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.808
Try a sausage.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.545
Spicy! What else do you have?

09:58.198 --> 10:02.602
Oh, no!
Vegetor has the meat gut.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.505
Quick! We've weakened
him with meat. Now let's...

10:07.407 --> 10:09.843
Ugh. Meat.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.979
Ugh. Vegetables.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.581
Now that's what I call
a balanced diet.
