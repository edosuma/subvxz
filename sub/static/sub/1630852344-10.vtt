00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:27.485 --> 00:31.448
Palindrome, not to be a
squished-in-the-back-of-a-van-seat driver,

00:31.531 --> 00:33.366
but any idea where you're going?

00:33.450 --> 00:35.285
It feels like we're driving in circles.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.662
Interlaced dodecahedrons, actually.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.956
They're the most difficult
pattern to tail.

00:40.040 --> 00:45.211
Who exactly would be after you? Other than
Cleve for dropping his house in the ocean.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.381
Well, Jun, long story short,
about nine years ago,

00:48.465 --> 00:52.385
Julius and I noticed that the stress of
the job was taking its toll on everyone.

00:52.469 --> 00:56.097
Then the hand of destiny
reached out from the netherworld,

00:56.181 --> 00:59.059
grabbed our hands,
and led us out to the desert,

00:59.142 --> 01:00.560
where it revealed…

01:00.643 --> 01:02.312
-Incineration Day--

01:05.899 --> 01:08.401
Long story shorter,
it's that cyborg super soldier

01:08.485 --> 01:10.737
that's programmed to
love the planet and hate us.

01:10.820 --> 01:15.033
But we saw her get crushed by a house
like the Wicked Witch of the West.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.910
Isn't she dead?

01:17.494 --> 01:18.328
Oh, my bad.

01:18.411 --> 01:21.581
An unstoppable cyborg super soldier.
I left that part out before.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.793
It's okay, pal.
We've all been there.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.142
<i>Restoration complete.</i>

01:42.018 --> 01:44.103
<i>Aquatic upgrades integrated.</i>

01:44.187 --> 01:47.106
The final resonator has been
recalibrated and is ready to go.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.108
-Excellent.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.694
Operation Waterslide is a go.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.575
-Oh my goodness!

02:00.078 --> 02:03.206
Come on, guys, we need a plan.
We can't keep driving around forever.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.415
-Whoa!

02:04.499 --> 02:07.293
I don't know, this thing
gets pretty good gas mileage.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.295
I think I might be becoming a van guy.

02:09.379 --> 02:12.882
I told you. Frostee, were you able to
find out anything at that mansion?

02:12.966 --> 02:15.635
It looks like Dann
placed her earthquake resonators

02:15.718 --> 02:17.762
all throughout Southern California--

02:17.846 --> 02:18.680
Cisco!

02:18.763 --> 02:20.765
Sorry, bro, but it's cramped in here.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.351
I gotta stretch my legs
before my butt falls asleep.

02:25.061 --> 02:26.771
It sounds like it already has.

02:28.439 --> 02:31.776
Nah, that's just Julius.
Car rides really knock him out.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.237
I-I'm up, I'm up.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.405
Can we focus?

02:35.488 --> 02:38.449
If Dann hasn't set off the resonators yet,
there must be a reason.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.495
-Layla's right.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.914
There's got to be
a piece of her plan she's missing.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.292
Maybe someone? Or something?

02:48.626 --> 02:50.378
Or somewhere.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.506
-Look!

02:54.716 --> 02:56.551
The resonators are along this fault line

02:56.634 --> 02:59.053
that ends all the way out
in the Channel Islands.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.181
The fault out there
is way deeper than the others.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.058
If she gets a resonator that deep,

03:04.142 --> 03:07.270
it'll set off a chain reaction
causing a massive earthquake!

03:07.353 --> 03:10.523
Then we need to get out there and stop her
before she has the chance.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.902
The Channel Islands stretch for miles.
We don't know where she'll strike.

03:13.985 --> 03:14.986
We do.

03:15.069 --> 03:19.365
There's an oil rig right here with a drill
that drives deep into the ocean floor.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.701
If she wants to get to the fault,
she'll go there.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.787
Perfect! Palindrome,
to the Channel Islands!

03:24.871 --> 03:26.456
-Wait!

03:29.083 --> 03:31.669
Look, Echo, I know
you always say that being a good spy

03:31.753 --> 03:35.006
is about not rushing into situations
and thinking things through, but--

03:35.089 --> 03:36.633
-Tony--
-Just let me finish, okay?

03:37.216 --> 03:40.303
Look, I've learned that sometimes
it's more about trusting your gut.

03:40.386 --> 03:44.724
And my gut is telling me that this is
our best shot at finally stopping Dann.

03:44.807 --> 03:47.727
I-I know sometimes that I drive too fast

03:47.810 --> 03:49.562
and, and I think too slow.

03:50.063 --> 03:54.067
Sometimes I leap before I look.
Sometimes I leap and never look, but--

03:54.150 --> 03:56.236
Tony! I'm in.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.321
Oh good!
I was running out of things to say.

03:58.404 --> 04:01.199
Also, if you're leaping,
you should take a look at some point.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.826
If we're gonna beat Dann,
we can't do it alone.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.538
That's true. She's single-handedly
kicked our butts around the block

04:07.622 --> 04:09.332
pretty much every time we've met.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.709
If she brings reinforcements, we're toast.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.087
The agency's compromised.
We can't call for backup.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.215
-We don't need the agency. We're in LA.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.174
That's right.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.761
If Dann's gonna bring an army,
we'll get one of our own.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.848
<i>First, we need someone</i>

04:25.932 --> 04:28.268
<i>who understands our enemy</i>
<i>better than we ever could.</i>

04:31.437 --> 04:35.817
<i>Hey Matsuo!</i>
<i>Long time no talk! Get it?</i>

04:37.819 --> 04:39.904
<i>Next, we're gonna need some muscle.</i>

04:39.988 --> 04:42.156
<i>Someone who'll do what we ask</i>
<i>without question.</i>

04:43.992 --> 04:45.243
Hey, Nacho and Rollie!

04:45.326 --> 04:47.620
You wanna come help us
beat some people up?

04:49.539 --> 04:50.748
Heck, yeah!

04:51.457 --> 04:53.960
<i>Last, we'll need someone</i>
<i>completely unpredictable</i>

04:54.043 --> 04:56.170
<i>to combat</i>
<i>Dann's ability to think rationally.</i>

04:56.254 --> 04:57.255
<i>An X factor.</i>

04:57.338 --> 05:00.717
Sorry, guys,
but I have a full-time job now.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.594
I can't just run off whenever
to mess around.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.139
This takes real responsibility.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.640
Ooh! Tacos!

05:09.809 --> 05:12.103
-Go, go, go!

05:14.355 --> 05:17.650
<i>We got our crew covered.</i>
<i>Now we just need to get our gear back.</i>

05:18.985 --> 05:20.236
Leave that to me.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.073
Nice work, Echo!

05:24.157 --> 05:26.409
Alright, everyone, let's gear up!

05:31.914 --> 05:35.293
Ooh! Mama's missed you.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.176
Let's ride.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.723
-Come on, come on!

05:58.441 --> 05:59.817
Look alive, guys.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.744
I'm still not picking up
any sign of Dann or the resonator.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.287
You guys see anything out there?

06:14.582 --> 06:15.917
Skies are all clear.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.380
No movement below deck.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.427
Does this mean we can go home now?

06:26.511 --> 06:30.306
No! This is a spy mission.
They take longer than five minutes.

06:32.391 --> 06:37.438
It must feel pretty good to have my baby,
the SS Wave Rave,

06:37.522 --> 06:40.775
as the world's swaggiest spy navy.

06:41.943 --> 06:45.488
But, you know,
when Layla called me for help, again,

06:45.571 --> 06:49.408
as a gentleman of the sea,
I was bound by honor to answer.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.494
<i>You didn't really help last time.</i>

06:51.577 --> 06:55.414
<i>You made us steal from your competitors</i>
<i>in the underground race circuit.</i>

06:56.082 --> 06:59.085
Wait a minute! You guys are
the ones that stole our racing list?

06:59.168 --> 07:02.004
Wait two minutes!
Our racing list was stolen?!

07:02.088 --> 07:05.299
Tony, how could you?
I thought we were friends.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.136
Uh… You know, it's, uh…

07:08.219 --> 07:10.972
Things move fast in the spy game,
like…

07:11.055 --> 07:14.142
It's hard to keep track of
who's your friend and who's your enemy.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.061
Dann is the enemy,
so cut the radio chatter

07:17.145 --> 07:19.105
<i>and focus on finding her!</i>

07:19.188 --> 07:22.775
Yeah, Nowhere's right. Dann needs to
get to this opening at the top of the rig

07:22.859 --> 07:24.569
to drop in her resonator.

07:24.652 --> 07:27.113
Guys, this is our last stand.

07:27.196 --> 07:30.366
We are the only thing stopping her
from sending LA into the ocean.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.702
<i>If Dann isn't here now,</i>
<i>she's on her way.</i>

07:32.785 --> 07:34.370
We need to be ready.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.916
-Is someone snacking?

07:39.625 --> 07:41.461
Sorry! I got hungry waiting.

07:42.336 --> 07:44.755
What! I wish I knew
we could bring our own snacks.

07:44.839 --> 07:48.050
Gary didn't have anything good in his bag
except this really spicy gum.

07:48.134 --> 07:48.968
-No!
-Spit it out!

07:49.051 --> 07:50.720
Aw…

07:52.138 --> 07:53.264
My bubblegum!

08:05.109 --> 08:07.320
-It's okay, T.

08:07.403 --> 08:10.656
There's still 63 cans left.
I'm sure you'll get one of them.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.492
I don't care about the Yoka!

08:12.575 --> 08:14.410
Is there any sign of Dann?

08:15.453 --> 08:16.412
No visual.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.749
Our scans haven't picked up
any digital signals.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.294
It's been hours and
Dann still hasn't shown up.

08:23.377 --> 08:27.381
Remember when homicidal cyborgs bent on
worldwide destruction not showing up

08:27.465 --> 08:28.424
was a good thing?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.718
Yeah, those were the days.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.345
I'm serious! Okay?

08:32.428 --> 08:36.390
I-I finally thought that we were one step
ahead of Dann, but what if I was wrong?

08:36.974 --> 08:40.937
What if there are no steps at all,
and, and we're just trapped behind her

08:41.020 --> 08:43.564
on one of those
slow-moving sidewalks at the airport,

08:43.648 --> 08:45.816
cursed to stare
at the back of her head forever!

08:45.900 --> 08:48.653
Tony, you have to stay calm.

08:48.736 --> 08:52.698
Dann is going to show up here, and
when she does, we're gonna take her down.

08:53.991 --> 08:57.078
All this waiting around on the ocean
kind of reminds me of

08:57.161 --> 09:00.748
that scene from <i>Holo-Shark Four:</i>
<i>The Anemone Down Below</i>.

09:01.791 --> 09:05.753
You know, right before holo-shark
comes and eats all those people.

09:05.836 --> 09:08.297
Buddy, I can't believe
you're a holo-shark fan.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.299
It's such an obvious rip-off

09:10.383 --> 09:13.177
of <i>The Adventures of Digi-Dolphin</i>
<i>and the Oyster Boys</i>.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.721
Can't be a rip-off
if it's better than the original.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.015
Thank you, Jun!

09:18.099 --> 09:21.310
I mean, come on:
holo-shark is a holographic shark.

09:21.394 --> 09:25.481
The Oyster Boys aren't even oysters.
They're clams!

09:26.482 --> 09:29.151
I cannot have
this conversation with you right now!

09:29.235 --> 09:31.988
Although it is refreshing
to be having it IRL.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.656
-Mm-hm.
-Cheers to that.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.291
-Nacho?
-All clear on the ground.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.377
Where is she?

09:46.460 --> 09:49.755
She's out there.
Quitting is not part of her programming.

09:49.839 --> 09:53.759
You know, when I first
began working with Cleve Kelso,

09:53.843 --> 09:56.804
we thought we could use
AI technology and cybernetics

09:56.887 --> 09:58.848
to create some kind of superhuman.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.560
What we created was an abomination.

10:02.643 --> 10:03.686
What happened?

10:03.769 --> 10:07.315
When a computer looks at a battlefield,
it doesn't see people.

10:07.398 --> 10:11.319
Only ones and zeroes. Success or failure.

10:11.402 --> 10:15.573
A computer can never learn what
a human knows from the day he is born:

10:15.656 --> 10:17.241
the value of life.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.869
I know, because that technology…

10:20.620 --> 10:22.121
is inside of me.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.248
What?! Who put it there?

10:24.332 --> 10:26.334
Dude, it's awesome!

10:26.417 --> 10:30.087
He has this giant arm cannon thingy
that goes…

10:30.171 --> 10:32.465
And then…

10:32.548 --> 10:33.466
Like that.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.051
Whoa! Let me see.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.387
No! I can never use my arm.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.474
I cannot allow its power
to take away my humanity.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.017
What? Aw…

10:43.100 --> 10:46.562
I've seen you control it. The time
might come for you to do it again.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.358
Looks like that time is now!

10:50.941 --> 10:52.109
It's Dann's army!

10:52.193 --> 10:54.362
Frostee, start scanning for the resonator.

10:54.445 --> 10:57.156
-We find that, we find Dann.
-<i>Copy that!</i>

11:02.286 --> 11:03.788
Let's get up there!

11:18.761 --> 11:20.721
Battle stations, everyone!

11:25.935 --> 11:27.395
Look out!

12:03.431 --> 12:04.974
-Nowhere!

12:34.920 --> 12:38.466
Guys, whatever happens, we can't
let Dann get to the top of this rig!

12:38.549 --> 12:39.550
<i>We're on it!</i>

12:54.148 --> 12:55.149
Hey, watch it!

12:58.319 --> 13:00.029
Now watch this!

13:28.265 --> 13:29.975
Hey!

13:33.562 --> 13:34.980
See that, Toretto?

13:35.064 --> 13:38.859
Bet you wish you were as good at
tram driving as I am at being a spy.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.158
Aw, really?

13:55.709 --> 13:57.711
-Yeah!

14:00.422 --> 14:01.257
Matsuo!

14:01.340 --> 14:03.759
-Your arm!

14:03.842 --> 14:06.720
-I… I can't.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.691
Geronimo!

14:19.400 --> 14:20.234
Ha!

14:26.615 --> 14:28.367
There's our X factor.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.035
Mitch, look out!

14:38.252 --> 14:40.921
These guys
just don't know when to give up.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.049
It's gotta mean Dann's close by.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.439
Frostee, Jun,
you got anything on your end?

14:58.522 --> 15:02.610
Yes! Jun and I were able to incorporate
a cooperative relay into our drones,

15:02.693 --> 15:06.614
allowing them to communicate wirelessly,
maximizing their defense protocols.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.449
I think she means about Dann.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.284
Oh. Sorry.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.620
Nope, still no sign of her.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.456
Bro, this might not be
the right time, but…

15:17.625 --> 15:21.128
I'm really gonna miss not understanding
a thing you say on these missions.

15:22.379 --> 15:26.258
<i> Don't worry. No matter how much</i>
<i>time passes, you'll never understand me.</i>

15:26.342 --> 15:27.927
Promise?

15:32.514 --> 15:35.017
-I need some backup here!
-We got you!

15:40.230 --> 15:41.982
I guess they were helpful.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.406
You're not getting through
to that drill.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.623
Aw, come on!

15:57.706 --> 16:00.751
<i>Guys, we finally picked up</i>
<i>the resonator's signal.</i>

16:00.834 --> 16:02.127
Pretty sure this guy has it.

16:02.711 --> 16:03.587
I'm all over it.

16:09.426 --> 16:13.305
Actually, maybe not. I'm not sure
if I'm winning this fight yet.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.015
The signal's coming toward the rig.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.142
It must be on one of the boats.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.527
Are you sure, Frostee?
I'm not seeing anything.

16:26.610 --> 16:29.530
According to my readout,
you should be right on top of it.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.998
Dann's in the water, and coming in fast!

16:42.334 --> 16:44.920
Get ready.
She's going to have to surface soon.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.089
<i>Uh, maybe not.</i>

16:47.172 --> 16:50.217
I just ran another scan of the island,
and we missed something.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.595
There's a small tunnel
that leads to the base of that drill!

16:54.179 --> 16:56.265
All of this was just a distraction.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.813
She was never planning to go through
the top. She's going right to the source!

17:03.397 --> 17:05.649
And she has the resonator!

17:05.733 --> 17:09.278
<i>We need to get that device</i>
<i>and blow it to smithereens!</i>

17:09.778 --> 17:12.281
I'll take care of these guys. Go!

17:44.104 --> 17:47.691
Guys,
I'm gonna need some help down here!

17:47.775 --> 17:49.109
I got your back.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.209
Uh, what was that?

18:05.292 --> 18:09.213
<i>Dann just shot a missile into</i>
<i>a cave. It blew a hole in the drill pipe.</i>

18:09.296 --> 18:11.423
<i>If she gets that resonator</i>
<i>in there, it's over!</i>

18:21.308 --> 18:23.519
<i>Ms. Nowhere,</i>
<i>can you see what's going on?</i>

18:23.602 --> 18:25.312
Not through this water.

18:25.395 --> 18:28.232
-Layla, Echo, report back.
-<i>I've got the resonator!</i>

18:30.275 --> 18:31.652
-We just need a way--

18:34.738 --> 18:36.949
-I gotta go!
-<i>Negative, Toretto.</i>

18:37.032 --> 18:40.828
<i>Hold your position! You're the only thing</i>
<i>stopping Dann from getting to that drill.</i>

18:40.911 --> 18:43.664
Don't worry, T. Frostee's on the scene.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.275
Get some, Dann!

19:30.919 --> 19:33.046
You're not getting up here!

19:37.217 --> 19:39.136
Oh, we're still going?

19:39.219 --> 19:41.805
Okay, all right, yeah.
Just, uh, just gimme a sec.

19:41.889 --> 19:45.767
You're about to have a front-row seat
for the fall of Babylon.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.353
I'm not done with you yet.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.406
Don't you see?

19:59.489 --> 20:02.367
I am here to save humanity!

20:02.451 --> 20:04.786
And right now, you are its biggest threat.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.879
Guys, Dann's at the drill.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.673
She's gonna drop the resonator.
Does anyone have a shot?

20:18.300 --> 20:19.301
Negative!

20:19.885 --> 20:21.470
But Matsuo can get to her.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.601
No, I can't.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.520
Matsuo, I know you're scared,

20:30.604 --> 20:33.649
but doing this
will save millions of lives.

20:33.732 --> 20:37.194
-I understand if you need time to--
-<i>Matsuo, do it now!</i>

21:12.479 --> 21:14.147
-Nice!

21:20.070 --> 21:21.238
What's going on?

21:21.321 --> 21:23.991
<i>The explosion ignited</i>
<i>the natural gas in the pipes.</i>

21:24.074 --> 21:25.617
<i>The entire rig is gonna blow!</i>

21:25.701 --> 21:27.577
Everyone, get clear!

21:32.874 --> 21:34.042
<i>Toretto?</i>

21:34.710 --> 21:35.961
Tony!

21:36.837 --> 21:37.671
Are you okay?

21:37.754 --> 21:39.673
-I'm…

21:40.173 --> 21:41.216
I'm fine.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.012
-Where's Dann?
-Guys, over here!

21:45.095 --> 21:47.180
Someone get some cuffs on her, now!

21:50.475 --> 21:52.352
I can't believe it.

21:52.436 --> 21:53.979
It's finally over.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.697
Well done, agent.

22:04.197 --> 22:08.201
-Couldn't have done it without my family.
-So… what now?

22:08.869 --> 22:11.246
Now, we go home.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.275
