WEBVTT

02:16.832 --> 02:18.703
Damn it.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.707
Hello?

02:30.498 --> 02:32.717
Is someone there?

02:37.853 --> 02:39.811
Goddamn it.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.742
You can't talk right now.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.746
You can't even breathe.

03:03.008 --> 03:05.228
You shouldn't curse, young lady.

03:05.272 --> 03:09.014
Don't curse
unless you want to be cursed.

03:09.928 --> 03:12.235
It's a sin, you know.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.976
Cursing.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.675
Do you know about sin, Ella?

03:19.460 --> 03:20.678
Go ahead and breathe.

03:22.811 --> 03:25.422
How do you know my name?

03:25.466 --> 03:28.425
I know loads of things.

03:29.948 --> 03:32.255
-Hey.

03:32.299 --> 03:35.171
Want to hear something
really interesting?

03:51.579 --> 03:53.494
It's about your fucking daddy!

04:43.500 --> 04:45.502
Goddamn nightmares.

04:52.814 --> 04:55.338
MAN:
Violent or upsetting dreams

04:55.382 --> 04:58.559
are merely the mind's attempt
to release the pressures

04:58.602 --> 05:01.344
of our daily thoughts
and fears.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.694
As you learn to meditate,

05:03.738 --> 05:07.350
you will discover your mind
is very difficult to silence.

05:07.394 --> 05:10.179
- -If you try
to stop your thoughts

05:10.222 --> 05:12.616
or prevent them
from entering your mind,

05:12.660 --> 05:15.706
you will only create conflict
when you are

05:15.750 --> 05:19.014
-trying to achieve pea...

05:20.929 --> 05:22.887
Somebody wants you.

05:22.931 --> 05:25.150
-Who?

05:25.194 --> 05:27.370
I have absolutely no idea.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.850
I'm so awake.

05:28.893 --> 05:31.069
You need to get in the pool.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.594
Excuse me.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.512
Josh is an idiot.

05:38.555 --> 05:39.904
No argument there.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.428
Will you pick up Ella today?

05:41.471 --> 05:43.517
I will pick up Ella
anytime, anywhere.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.866
Thank you.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.520
And tomorrow. I'm working.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.305
I thought I was
coming to see you.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.611
Really?

05:50.654 --> 05:52.874
Okay. Great.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.658
I'll ask Lena.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.356
Okay.

06:01.273 --> 06:02.927
Old man.

06:04.059 --> 06:06.061
Sunblock.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.590
Bye.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.991
Oh, my God, that's...

06:23.034 --> 06:25.080
That's so...

06:34.045 --> 06:36.613
This is a situation

06:36.657 --> 06:38.354
that cannot last.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.051
THEO:
One! Two!

06:40.095 --> 06:43.707
-Three. Four. Five.

06:43.751 --> 06:46.449
Six. Seven.

06:46.493 --> 06:49.017
Eight, nine, ten!
Ready or not, here we come.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.808
Where could she possibly be?

07:03.640 --> 07:05.207
There you are!

07:05.250 --> 07:07.078
All right, all right.
That was good.

07:14.695 --> 07:17.306
And you're...

07:17.349 --> 07:19.264
her dad?

07:19.308 --> 07:20.614
Husband.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.616
Well, there's nothing
on the call sheet,

07:22.659 --> 07:23.921
and it's a closed set.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.227
I'm her husband.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.794
It's a closed set.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.491
I'm her husband.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.753
MAN:
Rolling!

07:29.797 --> 07:31.494
-WOMAN: Rolling!
-Rolling!

07:31.538 --> 07:33.844
I'm three feet away from you.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.761
Yeah. Rolling.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.987
SUSANNA :
Yeah, okay.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.989
Oh, God.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.168
-SUSANNA: Oh, my God.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.518
Oh, my God.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.520
-MAN: Cut!
-And that's a cut!

07:57.564 --> 08:00.523
-I have her latte.
-Oh, yeah, come on in, man.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.916
-Um, he's...
-ASSISTANT: How you doing, man?

08:01.959 --> 08:03.221
-You good?
-Yeah, living the dream.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.875
Uh, maybe you could just
ask somebody if she's...

08:04.919 --> 08:06.442
-MAN : Going again.
-P.A.: Going again! Right away!

08:06.486 --> 08:07.704
Rolling!

08:11.055 --> 08:12.274
SUSANNA:
Okay.

08:25.243 --> 08:27.637
-MAN: And cut!
-P.A.: Cut!

08:27.681 --> 08:28.856
Turning around on her!

08:28.899 --> 08:30.118
What the fuck does that mean?

08:30.161 --> 08:31.598
All right, I'm sorry, man, okay?

08:31.641 --> 08:34.426
Look, I'll put a call through
on the radio. Yeah?

08:34.470 --> 08:36.298
What was your name again?

08:37.125 --> 08:38.866
Theo Conroy.

08:38.909 --> 08:42.434
-Yeah, I got a Theo... Conroy.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.788
Yeah, Theo Conroy here
to see Susie.

08:50.442 --> 08:51.879
-I totally got you.
-You did. You got me.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.402
It was excellent, man.
It was really good.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.969
-Thanks.
-Hey, so 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

08:55.012 --> 08:56.884
-Yep. -And, uh, I sent you
the script for my short, so...

08:56.927 --> 08:58.233
Oh, that's nice.
Thank you.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.061
-All right, I'll see you later.
-Later.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.584
There you are.

09:01.628 --> 09:02.498
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.892
Mm. I'm sorry about that scene.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.024
It was too much, right?

09:07.068 --> 09:09.853
I mean, it felt almost porny.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.463
Josh is such a perv.

09:11.507 --> 09:14.379
He gave me this whole thing
about how the female orgasm

09:14.423 --> 09:16.468
is never represented
in American film.

09:16.512 --> 09:18.645
I just think he wanted
to see me naked.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.951
I think he shot it
beautifully, though.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.258
-Uh-huh.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.183
What?

09:37.664 --> 09:39.535
So the guy, you know,
that stopped me,

09:39.579 --> 09:41.276
the one with
the walkie-talkie thing...

09:41.319 --> 09:43.365
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I definitely...

09:43.408 --> 09:44.932
I told him you were coming.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.411
No, it's not that.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.544
He recognized me.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.983
I'm sorry. That sucks.

09:53.027 --> 09:55.725
Ah, I should be
used to it by now.

09:56.813 --> 09:59.163
They think you're dangerous.

10:02.471 --> 10:04.691
You're not supposed to like it.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.651
I'm not supposed to do
a lot of things.

10:12.350 --> 10:15.223
You want to have me in the car?

10:26.060 --> 10:27.235
-Ooh.

10:27.278 --> 10:30.673
Oh, God, it felt so good
not to fake it.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.941
I hated being there today.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.464
I forgot it was today.

10:39.508 --> 10:42.206
Hearing that
was like a knife in my brain.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.947
I'm so sorry.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.951
If I don't get you
out of here for a while,

10:47.995 --> 10:49.823
I think I'm going to go nuts.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.041
Let's just go.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.303
-Where?
-Anywhere.

10:52.347 --> 10:53.653
Away from here.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.176
Well, I've got a few weeks

10:55.219 --> 10:56.699
before I start shooting
in London.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.222
Okay. Over there,
we'll go early.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.964
We'll get a place in the country
just you and me and Ella.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.184
It's so good when it's just
the three of us.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.707
Yeah, okay.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.187
Yeah.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.539
I think you're done.

11:11.714 --> 11:12.846
Sorry.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.891
-I'm greedy.
-Mm.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.416
I'm not gonna do these kinds
of parts anymore.

11:18.460 --> 11:19.766
That's not realistic.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.985
You're rich and retired.
I'll live off of you.

11:22.029 --> 11:24.858
You don't mean that.

11:24.901 --> 11:27.469
I pretend. It's my job.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.253
I'm working on
the jealous thing.

11:29.297 --> 11:30.733
I really am.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.735
I'm writing in the journal.
I meditate.

11:32.779 --> 11:33.997
I do the app.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.782
I love you so much.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.872
Then come away with me.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.965
-THEO: You're left.
-SUSANNA: No, I'm not.

12:30.445 --> 12:33.535
THEO: Uh... honey,
I think you're left.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.363
SUSANNA: If I had been
any further right,

12:35.406 --> 12:36.668
I would have hit that guy.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.105
-THEO: You're doing great.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.236
SUSANNA:
Do you want to drive?

12:39.280 --> 12:40.411
THEO:
No, no, no, I mean it.

12:40.455 --> 12:41.717
SUSANNA:
Yeah, so do I.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.850
-Please, drive.
-I'm too old to flip my brain.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.591
-You got this.

12:46.635 --> 12:50.378
Daddy, because you're old,
you'll die before Mommy, right?

12:50.421 --> 12:52.075
-THEO: Hey. Hey, hey.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.773
I'm not that old.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.949
But you will die first, right?

12:55.992 --> 12:57.994
Not if I can help it.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.826
Uh, the thing is, sweetie,

13:03.870 --> 13:06.263
nobody really knows
when anybody's gonna die.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.265
Doesn't matter how old you are.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.180
Why do we have to die at all?

13:10.224 --> 13:14.010
Because life is not survivable.

13:15.403 --> 13:18.232
Really? That-that's what
you came up with?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.064
SUSANNA:
Sorry.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.980
Shit.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.509
I love your dark side,
but she's six years old.

13:34.552 --> 13:35.727
I got it.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.338
Can you tell her about Heaven
next time?

13:37.381 --> 13:39.340
You can't sell
what you don't believe.

Hey.

Get over here!

16:21.284 --> 16:23.417
I didn't give you
a very good answer

16:23.460 --> 16:24.984
to your question before, did I?

16:25.027 --> 16:27.290
No, Baba.
It was very disappointing.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.900
Okay, here's the thing.

16:28.944 --> 16:33.079
I don't plan on dying
for a really long time,

16:33.122 --> 16:36.734
but when I finally do
and when Mommy does

16:36.778 --> 16:39.911

16:39.955 --> 16:42.740
we're all gonna be
together again.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.526
In Heaven.

Are you sure?

16:47.745 --> 16:49.878
That's what they say.

16:49.921 --> 16:53.055
Does everyone go to Heaven?

16:53.099 --> 16:55.188
-Uh...
-SUSANNA: Oh, my God, Ella,

16:55.231 --> 16:56.537
you have to come up here.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.539
Your bed is the size
of Connecticut.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.323
ELLA:
What?!

17:00.367 --> 17:02.804
Mom, let me see, let me see.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.371
I want to jump on it!

17:05.763 --> 17:07.548
Oh, my God, I love it!

17:07.591 --> 17:09.158
It's amazing!

17:33.835 --> 17:36.011
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet,
tweet, tweet, tweet.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.406
♪ Tweet, tweet, tweet,
tweet, tweet, tweet. ♪

17:39.449 --> 17:41.190
Mm...

17:49.764 --> 17:52.245
-Huh?

17:52.288 --> 17:54.073
-THEO: Ella.

17:55.987 --> 17:56.945
Hey.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.425
You got to get to sleep,
sweetie.

17:58.468 --> 18:02.124
: But there was
a shadow on the wall.

18:02.168 --> 18:05.301
I know it's fun,
but it's time to sleep.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.738
Okay. Come on.
Scooch down, scooch down.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.479
All the way.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.046
Grab Bunny.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.614
-: Okay.

18:13.657 --> 18:14.963
Good night.

18:15.006 --> 18:17.270
Can you turn off the lights
for me, please?

18:17.313 --> 18:18.793
-Off?
-Yes.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.360
-You sure?
-Yes.

18:20.403 --> 18:21.839
Okay.

18:21.883 --> 18:24.015
-Good night, honey.
-Good night, Baba.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.904
THEO: Honey, what's the name
of the owner again?

18:42.947 --> 18:44.601
Stetler or Statler.

18:44.645 --> 18:45.994
You ever talk to him?

18:46.037 --> 18:48.083
No, just e-mail.
I have his number, though. Why?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.998
Oh, thermostat's broken
downstairs.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.652
It's gonna be cold tonight.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.306
-Upstairs okay?
-Yeah.

18:53.349 --> 18:54.655
Can you call him tomorrow?

18:54.698 --> 18:55.960
Can you?

18:56.004 --> 18:57.919
Uh, yeah, I mean, I-I could,

18:57.962 --> 19:00.008
but you booked it
under your name, right?

19:00.051 --> 19:01.792
Yeah, of course I did.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.490
I'm sorry.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.448
I-I know I'm a pain in the ass.

19:05.492 --> 19:06.841
Nobody would know you here.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.016
THEO:
You would be surprised.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.409
SUSANNA:
Okay.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.541
I just don't want to deal
with all the weirdness.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.456
Okay, I totally get it.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.892
Hey.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.331
I need to tell you something.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.898
I downloaded all of season three
before we left.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.597
I adore you.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.599
Can we watch the recap first?

19:25.642 --> 19:29.080
Have I ever denied you
the recap?

19:30.691 --> 19:32.649
I'm gonna close up downstairs.

19:32.693 --> 19:34.303
You do that.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.351
Oh. Hi, honey.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.789
How much did I say?

19:41.832 --> 19:44.052
Nothing. Totally innocuous.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.409
Guess that one stays on.

20:51.772 --> 20:54.862
Jesus.
You got enough switches?

21:06.352 --> 21:09.137
MAN : Previously
on Credible Threat...

21:24.674 --> 21:26.372
Hmm.

22:36.964 --> 22:39.270
So, as it turns out,

22:39.314 --> 22:43.405
there's this whole other hallway
right underneath the stairs.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.624
Really?

22:47.453 --> 22:50.369
Oh, come on,
you can't be asleep yet.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.417
-Honey.

22:55.461 --> 22:56.679
Whoa.

22:56.723 --> 22:57.898
It's okay. It's okay.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.813
Shh. You okay?
What's going on?

22:59.856 --> 23:01.728
I had the worst dream.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.643
Yeah? Already?

23:03.686 --> 23:05.122
What happened to you?

23:05.166 --> 23:07.647
I was turning off the lights.

23:07.690 --> 23:10.040
How long?

24:38.041 --> 24:39.652
MAN:
An important aspect

24:39.695 --> 24:43.394
of your work in the program
is your daily journal.

24:46.136 --> 24:48.617
Take a moment,
and clearly assess

24:48.661 --> 24:51.185
your physical
and emotional state

24:51.228 --> 24:54.057
using one-word descriptors.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.504
Okay.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.551
Okay. Careful.

25:09.595 --> 25:10.770
You know what?

25:10.813 --> 25:12.728
Please don't go too high.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.557
MAN:
How do I feel?

25:17.733 --> 25:19.822
What do I feel?

25:21.476 --> 25:23.086
Can you come down, please?

25:23.130 --> 25:25.349
Ella, that is too high.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.482
Ella.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.440
Ella, please don't ignore me.

25:29.484 --> 25:32.443
Why do people hate Daddy
so much?

25:33.444 --> 25:34.402
What?

25:34.445 --> 25:36.535
Why do they hate him?

25:36.578 --> 25:38.232
Why-why would you say that?

25:38.275 --> 25:39.712
'Cause they do.

25:39.755 --> 25:40.887
Come down, please.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.932
I've heard you guys talking.

25:42.976 --> 25:44.151
That's eavesdropping.

25:44.194 --> 25:45.848
Come down, please.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.110
I bet I can stand up.

25:47.154 --> 25:48.416
-Don't. No, no, no, no, no.
-I'm doing it.

25:48.459 --> 25:49.635
Don't stand up, please.

25:49.678 --> 25:51.071
-I'm doing it. Look.
-Ella. Ella.

25:52.594 --> 25:55.118
-SUSANNA: Are you okay?

26:04.171 --> 26:07.043
Ella, are you sure you're okay?

26:07.087 --> 26:09.306
Yeah.

26:09.350 --> 26:13.136
Why do people hate Baba so much?

26:17.706 --> 26:20.883
You know that...
that your dad, um,

26:20.927 --> 26:23.538
was married
before he and I met, right?

26:23.582 --> 26:24.626
Mm-hmm.

26:24.670 --> 26:27.150
His wife's name was Caroline.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.196
And she died?

26:30.023 --> 26:32.895
Well, the thing is...

26:32.939 --> 26:35.506
the thing is, um, how she died.

26:37.247 --> 26:39.467
ELLA:
She died in the bathtub?

26:39.510 --> 26:42.296
SUSANNA: Yeah, yeah,
she drowned in the bathtub.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.733
Why didn't she just sit up?

26:44.777 --> 26:46.735
Uh, well, she couldn't.

26:46.779 --> 26:48.781
Why not?

26:48.824 --> 26:50.173
Should we go back?

26:50.217 --> 26:51.914
No.

26:59.748 --> 27:03.317
She couldn't get up,
because she was sleeping.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.188
That doesn't make sense.

27:06.189 --> 27:08.235
Sometimes grown-ups
take medicine.

27:08.278 --> 27:09.845
Sometimes they take
too much medicine

27:09.889 --> 27:11.847
or they take
the wrong kind of medicine,

27:11.891 --> 27:14.850
a kind that they shouldn't ever
have taken at all.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.548
And if they do,

27:17.592 --> 27:23.467
they can fall asleep so hard
that they can't wake up.

27:28.777 --> 27:31.519
So, Daddy came home
from work one day,

27:31.562 --> 27:33.695
and she was in the bathtub.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.566
And, uh...

27:35.610 --> 27:38.134
she had already passed away.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.746
There was nothing he could do.
It was an accident.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.356
The thing is,

27:42.399 --> 27:45.576
they thought he-he put her
in the tub.

27:47.753 --> 27:51.713
Did they... did they think
that Daddy killed her?

27:52.758 --> 27:53.976
Yeah.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.982
Did he?

28:03.856 --> 28:06.206
Did Daddy kill her?

28:06.249 --> 28:08.817
No. No.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.561
Okay.

28:14.997 --> 28:17.870
Why didn't he just tell them
he didn't do it?

28:17.913 --> 28:20.699
Well, he did, and they just
didn't believe him.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.657
And because Daddy was
a rich banker,

28:22.701 --> 28:24.877
lots of people were
interested in his trial.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.313
And when it went to trial,

28:26.356 --> 28:28.402
he was on TV,
and he got sort of famous.

28:28.445 --> 28:30.012
ELLA:
What happened at the trial?

28:31.971 --> 28:33.755
SUSANNA: The judge and the jury
all found him innocent,

28:33.799 --> 28:35.757
and they said he could go home
and start a new life,

28:35.801 --> 28:37.411
but some people didn't want
to let him.

28:39.326 --> 28:42.111
Some people think that
if you're accused,

28:42.155 --> 28:44.679
you must be guilty of something.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.334
Hello.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.817
Hello.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.385
Oh. Hi.

29:38.428 --> 29:41.083
Good morning. Uh, afternoon.

29:41.127 --> 29:43.433
Uh... yeah.

29:43.477 --> 29:46.132
Let's see.
I-I need some, uh...

29:46.175 --> 29:49.004
butter, bread.

29:57.186 --> 29:59.841
Oh. Great.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.321
-Great.

30:01.364 --> 30:04.628
Yeah, uh, bread, egg...

30:07.153 --> 30:09.372
-Okay.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.121
Oh, good.
Here comes the bread.

30:19.165 --> 30:21.863
Mm-hmm.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.822
And eggs.

30:28.696 --> 30:30.654
Got to be kidding me.

30:32.743 --> 30:35.050
Looks like we got everything.

30:37.531 --> 30:39.489
You staying up there?

30:39.533 --> 30:41.361
I'm so sorry.
I don't speak Welsh.

30:41.404 --> 30:42.971
It's English.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.190
-Oh.
-You...

30:44.233 --> 30:46.496
staying... up there?

30:46.540 --> 30:48.150
Uh, yeah.

30:48.194 --> 30:49.369
Oh.

30:49.412 --> 30:50.849
Uh-huh.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.895
Anything happened yet?

30:55.027 --> 30:57.029
Excuse me?

30:57.072 --> 30:58.595
You meet Stetler?

30:58.639 --> 31:01.033
Is that, uh... that's the...
that's the owner, right?

31:01.076 --> 31:02.773
Stetler.

31:03.818 --> 31:04.906
Uh, no, hmm-mm.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.082
Found it on the Internet.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.780
-Oh.
-Yeah.

31:09.824 --> 31:12.914
The house is... fairly new,
it seems like?

31:12.958 --> 31:14.655
-About four years.
-Hmm.

31:14.698 --> 31:16.396
What was there before?

31:16.439 --> 31:18.050
Another house.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.268
Makes sense.

31:19.312 --> 31:20.922
House, then a house.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.142
Then a house, then a house,
then a house.

31:25.361 --> 31:28.060
-26 quid.
-Great.

31:28.103 --> 31:30.236
26...

31:30.279 --> 31:31.802
There you go.

31:39.158 --> 31:40.811
Change?

31:41.856 --> 31:43.205
Credit.

31:43.249 --> 31:45.425
Okay, yeah. I guess we're
gonna be here a while.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.430
Present for you.

31:50.473 --> 31:53.215
Try the right angles.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.958
Will do.

32:06.011 --> 32:08.143
Oh, come on.

32:12.278 --> 32:13.932
Hi.

32:16.456 --> 32:18.501
Excuse me.

32:20.242 --> 32:23.115
-How'd you find the house?
-On the Internet.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.030
No, I never met Stetler.

32:25.073 --> 32:28.033
-I need to...
-You never saw Stetler?

32:28.076 --> 32:29.686
No.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.515
Well, he saw you.

32:36.824 --> 32:39.174
Enough with the Stetler.

32:54.276 --> 32:55.974
Hey, I'm back.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.891
Hey.

33:04.591 --> 33:07.811
Sorry that happened to you,
Baba.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.553
Shit.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.207
Walk me through

33:12.251 --> 33:14.296
exactly what you told her.

33:14.340 --> 33:15.515
I did.

33:15.558 --> 33:17.082
Tell me again.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.693
-I can't remember word for word.

33:19.736 --> 33:21.738
But I said the stuff
that we talked about saying,

33:21.782 --> 33:23.914
-when the time came.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.700
And you just decided
that the time had come.

33:26.743 --> 33:29.050
I didn't plan it, actually.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.747
She asked,
and she wouldn't let it go.

33:30.791 --> 33:32.053
You know how she is.

33:32.097 --> 33:33.707
She gave me that look
where she doesn't blink.

33:33.750 --> 33:34.751
It's creepy.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.536
It was my story.

33:36.579 --> 33:39.365
It happened to me,
and I knew exactly

33:39.408 --> 33:42.759
what I wanted to say to her
when it was time.

33:42.803 --> 33:45.545
Right, and it was time, okay?

33:45.588 --> 33:47.068
I couldn't lie to her.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.070
When she was seven--
that's what we decided.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.898
That is a completely
arbitrary number.

33:50.941 --> 33:52.508
She obviously overheard us
last night.

33:52.552 --> 33:54.771
She asked me point-blank.

33:55.903 --> 33:58.079
That's how it happened, huh?

33:58.123 --> 34:00.081
-Yeah, that's...

34:00.125 --> 34:02.910
-that is how it happened, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

34:04.694 --> 34:06.653
What does that mean?

34:06.696 --> 34:08.133
I don't know.
You know, it's just...

34:08.176 --> 34:10.222
sometimes it's hard to tell
what's real with you.

34:10.265 --> 34:11.266
That's all.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.095
Excuse me?

34:19.187 --> 34:22.538
You're just
a really good actress.

34:22.582 --> 34:24.062
That's all I'm saying.

34:24.105 --> 34:27.239
And you're
a passive-aggressive dick,

34:27.282 --> 34:29.023
is all I'm saying.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.635
I got to make dinner.

34:35.421 --> 34:36.900
That supposed to be meat?

34:36.944 --> 34:38.728
Think there's a lot of options
down there

34:38.772 --> 34:40.426
in the village of the damned?

34:40.469 --> 34:42.384
No olives?

34:42.428 --> 34:43.907
You chose this place, not me.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.431
No, I didn't.
You sent me the link.

34:45.474 --> 34:47.302
I absolutely did not.
You sent it to me.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.999
All right, can...
can we please stop?

34:49.043 --> 34:50.784
Who would have imagined
that they don't have

34:50.827 --> 34:52.960
the Whole Foods olive bar
in Wales?

34:53.003 --> 34:55.658
Let me know when you're done
being an asshole.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.619
Yeah. Go get on your phone.

35:55.414 --> 35:56.893
Thank you, Ella.

35:56.937 --> 35:59.026
ELLA:
You're welcome, Baba.

36:01.724 --> 36:03.161
Look.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.338
Cool.

36:06.381 --> 36:09.167
Thanks.

37:59.494 --> 38:01.931
Honey, uh...

38:01.975 --> 38:05.021
-do you need shampoo?
-What?

38:06.501 --> 38:09.591
THEO: Shampoo.
Uh, do you need any shampoo?

38:09.635 --> 38:11.593
I have some.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.247
Oh, okay, so...

38:13.291 --> 38:15.641
so you are washing your hair.

38:15.684 --> 38:16.990
Huh?

38:17.033 --> 38:19.209
Nothing.
Not... not important.

38:19.253 --> 38:22.169
Honey, I can't hear anything
that you're saying.

38:22.212 --> 38:25.303
You can talk,
but you come in here.

38:25.346 --> 38:27.566
No, never mind.

38:29.176 --> 38:33.180
Was there enough, uh, hot water?

38:33.223 --> 38:34.790
What are you doing?

38:34.834 --> 38:37.010
Never mind. All good.

38:59.511 --> 39:01.513
I'm done.

39:01.556 --> 39:03.558
With what?

39:03.602 --> 39:06.082
Being an asshole.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.349
You know,
I've-I've had this cloud

39:11.392 --> 39:13.525
that's been hanging over me
for a while now,

39:13.568 --> 39:15.701
and I've just been
an idiot about it.

39:15.744 --> 39:17.398
But I'm done with all that now.

39:17.442 --> 39:20.096
It was... it was stupid.
I'm sorry.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.055
About Ella?

39:22.882 --> 39:24.362
Yeah.

39:24.405 --> 39:28.061
Yeah, you handled it...
just right, sounds like.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.411
B-Better than I could've.

39:30.455 --> 39:33.719
You should've seen the way
she looked at me after dinner.

39:33.762 --> 39:36.112
She loves her Baba.

39:37.984 --> 39:40.987
I'm really sorry
for thinking ill of you.

39:41.030 --> 39:43.511
It was a sin. I regret it.

39:43.555 --> 39:46.819
Catholic school
fucked you up good.

39:46.862 --> 39:49.082
Yeah.

39:50.475 --> 39:53.478
That was a half-decent apology.
Thank you.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.238
-You okay?
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:15.282 --> 40:17.458
I'm good. I'm good, honey.
Just go back to sleep.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.329
Okay.

40:22.724 --> 40:26.380
MAN: The clear expression
of your thoughts and feelings

40:26.424 --> 40:29.470
is essential
to any relationship.

40:30.819 --> 40:34.693
Emotional truth
is the only pathway to peace.

40:34.736 --> 40:37.391
Suspicion and mistrust

40:37.435 --> 40:40.307
are merely impulses of energy,

40:40.350 --> 40:43.179
and they are not always
under your control.

40:46.922 --> 40:48.707
Then again,

40:48.750 --> 40:53.233
sometimes those feelings
are based in fact.

43:16.811 --> 43:18.204
Hello?

43:19.031 --> 43:20.032
Hello?

43:25.994 --> 43:27.692
Hello?

43:29.563 --> 43:32.653
-Hello.

43:42.010 --> 43:43.925
Okay. Okay, no, no.

43:43.969 --> 43:46.362
This can't be happening.

43:46.406 --> 43:49.757
No, this is definitely
not happening.

43:50.845 --> 43:52.630
Ella?

43:53.718 --> 43:55.154
Oh, my God.

43:58.853 --> 44:00.638
Ella!

44:01.987 --> 44:03.945
Oh! Oh, my God!

44:03.989 --> 44:05.120
Ella!

44:05.164 --> 44:06.687
No. Ella.

44:06.731 --> 44:07.862
Oh, God.

44:07.906 --> 44:09.516
Oh, my God.

44:09.559 --> 44:10.952
No.

44:10.996 --> 44:12.693
Oh, God.

44:12.737 --> 44:13.825
Oh...

44:15.653 --> 44:17.306
Oh, God.

44:18.220 --> 44:19.352
Honey, honey.

44:19.395 --> 44:20.875
Wake up, wake up.

44:22.137 --> 44:25.184
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. No.

44:25.227 --> 44:27.012
Oh! Oh!

44:27.055 --> 44:28.927
You're dreaming. Dreaming.

44:28.970 --> 44:30.189
Wake up! Wake up!

44:30.232 --> 44:31.233
Wake up!

44:33.105 --> 44:34.672
It's a dream.

44:34.715 --> 44:36.151
It's a dream!

44:36.195 --> 44:38.719
It's a goddamn dream!

44:54.387 --> 44:57.172
Fucking nightmares.

44:58.870 --> 45:00.567
Oh, boy.

45:00.610 --> 45:02.830
I just had a really bad dream.

45:02.874 --> 45:05.006
Oh, yeah?

45:05.050 --> 45:07.530
I was onstage, and I...

45:07.574 --> 45:10.185
there was a huge audience,
and I didn't even know the play.

45:10.229 --> 45:11.491
Like, I didn't have a clue.

45:11.534 --> 45:13.319
I hate those dreams.

45:13.362 --> 45:15.669
I think I got you beat.

45:17.453 --> 45:19.847
Oh, it's really nice in here.

45:19.891 --> 45:22.328
THEO:
Okay, that's encouraging.

45:22.371 --> 45:23.590
Two doors.

45:23.633 --> 45:24.939
What, last night
there were three?

45:24.983 --> 45:26.158
Yeah, there was another one

45:26.201 --> 45:27.289
right behind
this bookshelf here.

45:27.333 --> 45:28.638
Went to this staircase,

45:28.682 --> 45:30.815
and then-then there was
this weird kind of hall

45:30.858 --> 45:33.731
that went around and led
to a place-- under the house.

45:33.774 --> 45:36.081
And Ella...
God, it was horrible.

45:36.124 --> 45:38.344
What's behind this door?

45:40.172 --> 45:42.783
This is where the washer is.

45:42.827 --> 45:45.612
God, this is
a gigantic laundry room.

45:45.655 --> 45:48.354
This is it right here
from the dream.

45:49.659 --> 45:51.749
Oh, sure, that's a bummer.

45:51.792 --> 45:55.361
Okay, so, um,
you saw the picture,

45:55.404 --> 45:57.667
and then you put it all
in your dream.

45:57.711 --> 45:59.278
Okay, okay,
but-but at what point

45:59.321 --> 46:00.714
did I actually fall asleep?

46:00.758 --> 46:02.542
Immediately after sex,
like always.

46:02.585 --> 46:05.850
-You did. You did.

46:05.893 --> 46:09.114
You don't remember me getting up
and leaving the bedroom?

46:09.157 --> 46:11.029
Hmm-mm. I don't know.

46:11.072 --> 46:12.465
I don't think so.

46:12.508 --> 46:14.467
Mm, no. I don't think so.

46:14.510 --> 46:15.816
I would've woken up.

46:15.860 --> 46:17.818
You're not very good
at sneaking around.

46:17.862 --> 46:21.256
So everything from the time
I got out of bed was a dream.

46:21.300 --> 46:23.519
Sounds like it.

46:25.434 --> 46:27.697
And I never went downstairs?

46:27.741 --> 46:30.004
Nope.

46:31.397 --> 46:33.312
Do you like it here?

46:33.355 --> 46:34.835
In this room?

46:34.879 --> 46:36.619
This house.

46:37.490 --> 46:39.231
No. Do you?

46:39.274 --> 46:41.015
I hate it.

46:42.277 --> 46:43.757
But we just got here.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.586
I know, but sometimes
when you pick something online,

46:46.629 --> 46:47.979
you don't really know
what you're getting,

46:48.022 --> 46:49.807
and you make a mistake.
It happens.

46:49.850 --> 46:51.939
Where are we gonna go now?

46:51.983 --> 46:54.724
Hotel for a little while,
someplace really fun.

46:54.768 --> 46:56.944
The important thing is that
we'll all be together

46:56.988 --> 47:00.339
before I have to start work
and you and your dad go home.

47:00.382 --> 47:02.863
But how long will you be gone?

47:02.907 --> 47:04.038
Eight weeks.

47:04.082 --> 47:05.997
That's a really long time.

47:06.040 --> 47:08.521
I know, but you and your dad
are gonna come visit

47:08.564 --> 47:09.870
halfway through,
like we talked about.

47:09.914 --> 47:11.916
Why can't we just be with you
the whole time?

47:11.959 --> 47:13.526
Let's just go outside
and run around

47:13.569 --> 47:15.180
before we have to get
in the car.

47:16.659 --> 47:19.314
SUSANNA: Seven, eight,
nine, ten, here I come!

49:00.502 --> 49:02.504
Darn it.

49:24.483 --> 49:26.702
I didn't dream that.

49:40.107 --> 49:43.023
-SUSANNA: Got you!

49:48.376 --> 49:50.552
You're so slippery!

49:51.553 --> 49:53.033
THEO:
Hey.

49:53.077 --> 49:54.556
Hi, Baba.

49:55.731 --> 49:57.124
Susanna, come here a sec.

49:57.168 --> 50:00.171
-What is it?
-ELLA: Come play with us.

50:01.041 --> 50:02.869
I want to talk to Mommy first.

50:06.220 --> 50:09.354
Baba can be weird sometimes.

50:09.397 --> 50:11.138
-Ella, go inside.
-Why?

50:11.182 --> 50:12.574
Because it's gonna rain.

50:18.493 --> 50:20.843
You ready to go?

50:22.019 --> 50:23.890
What is it?

50:29.809 --> 50:32.333
You have two phones.

50:35.771 --> 50:37.730
Must have been a lot of work

50:37.773 --> 50:40.689
keeping track of two
of those things.

50:44.911 --> 50:47.131
Yeah, it's exhausting.

50:51.048 --> 50:54.573
The guy, Max,
from the shoot in Mexico?

50:56.618 --> 50:58.664
Yeah.

50:59.752 --> 51:01.971
That's too bad.

51:05.932 --> 51:09.414
Has he been here, in this house?

51:09.457 --> 51:11.807
Of course... of course not.

51:11.851 --> 51:13.418
Because somebody wrote
in my journal.

51:13.461 --> 51:14.767
He's not here.

51:14.810 --> 51:16.377
He's in New York.
He has meetings.

51:16.421 --> 51:18.814
I don't give a shit
where Max has meetings.

51:18.858 --> 51:20.033
I'm sorry.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.557
So, who wrote in my book?

51:22.601 --> 51:25.169
Um, I don't know.
Uh, did Ella?

51:25.212 --> 51:27.693
Is that the biggest problem
we have right now?

51:28.998 --> 51:32.132
I bet that guy can fuck you
all night, huh?

51:33.177 --> 51:35.092
Don't make it ugly.

51:35.135 --> 51:38.704
I'm 100% sure that I am not
the one that made this ugly.

51:38.747 --> 51:41.010
I can't do this.

51:41.054 --> 51:43.491
If only you'd said that to Max.

51:43.535 --> 51:45.102
You know, it'd feel a lot better

51:45.145 --> 51:48.017
if you yelled and screamed
like a normal person.

51:49.628 --> 51:51.673
No, thanks.

51:53.197 --> 51:54.807
You got to go.

51:55.764 --> 51:57.679
What? Where?

51:57.723 --> 51:59.203
I don't know.

51:59.246 --> 52:01.118
Not here.
Stay in the village.

52:01.161 --> 52:02.771
I'm not staying
in the fucking village.

52:02.815 --> 52:04.773
-You go if you want to.
-No, you leave.

52:04.817 --> 52:06.384
Fine. I'll take Ella.

52:07.428 --> 52:09.213
Like hell you will.

52:09.256 --> 52:12.346
You-you're not making
the rules now.

52:12.390 --> 52:14.653
You broke the rules.

52:14.696 --> 52:16.959
There are no rules anymore.

52:37.371 --> 52:39.068
Other side.

52:40.244 --> 52:42.550
How long am I supposed to stay
in purgatory?

52:42.594 --> 52:44.117
I just need a night to myself.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.337
-So do you.
-Don't tell me what I need.

52:46.380 --> 52:48.034
A night by yourself.

52:48.077 --> 52:50.036
Yes, Theo, I get it--
by myself.

52:50.079 --> 52:52.560
Max is not here.
He has never been here.

52:52.604 --> 52:55.346
Oh, right, 'cause of all
the big meetings in New York.

52:55.389 --> 52:57.130
Can I get in, please?

52:57.174 --> 53:00.089
Hey, listen, um,
you know, I want to take back

53:00.133 --> 53:03.092
that "fuck you all night"
thing I said.

53:03.136 --> 53:05.138
-Yeah, whatever.
-Yeah, let me be clear--

53:05.182 --> 53:07.053
I don't actually care
who fucks you all night.

53:07.096 --> 53:09.316
-Oh, my God. Jesus.
-I'm sure it's quite a list.

53:13.929 --> 53:16.410
-Drive safe, sweetie.

53:25.114 --> 53:28.205
Hey, do you have
both your phones?

54:24.870 --> 54:26.915
THEO: They didn't have
any peanut butter.

54:26.959 --> 54:29.222
-ELLA: Why not?
-THEO: It's not a thing here.

54:29.266 --> 54:32.094
-So, what's that stuff?
-I don't know.

54:32.138 --> 54:34.967
Starts with L.
Well, two L's, actually.

54:35.010 --> 54:37.012
I don't want it.

54:39.406 --> 54:41.843
-It's pretty good.
-No, it isn't.

54:41.887 --> 54:43.802
Okay, it's not pretty good.

54:43.845 --> 54:45.499
It tastes kind of weird.

54:45.543 --> 54:49.198
But it's not poison,
and it's what we have.

54:49.242 --> 54:51.288
-I'm not eating it.
-Could you please

54:51.331 --> 54:53.681
just stop with the scooter
for one second, honey?

54:53.725 --> 54:56.162
So you might as well just

54:56.205 --> 54:58.817
throw it in
the garbage can for me

54:58.860 --> 55:00.514
because I'm just not
gonna eat it.

55:00.558 --> 55:03.169
Honey, could you please
get off the scooter?

55:04.170 --> 55:06.346
-I'm sorry.

55:06.390 --> 55:08.000
Sorry.

55:08.043 --> 55:09.610
It's okay. It's okay.

55:09.654 --> 55:12.352
Honey, it's okay.

55:19.751 --> 55:21.622
I don't like it here.

55:23.058 --> 55:24.669
I don't think I do, either.

55:24.712 --> 55:28.542
I have weird dreams,
and I get in bad moods.

55:28.586 --> 55:30.065
Me, too.

55:30.109 --> 55:33.155
Did you and Mommy have a fight?

55:36.420 --> 55:37.986
Yeah.

55:38.030 --> 55:40.859
Today is a terrible day.

55:40.902 --> 55:43.514
-I want to go home.
-So do I.

55:43.557 --> 55:46.908
As soon as Mom gets back
with the car, okay?

55:46.952 --> 55:49.563
-When will that be?
-Tomorrow.

56:00.661 --> 56:02.402
Hmm.

56:07.886 --> 56:09.583
Huh.

56:14.458 --> 56:16.634
-What are you doing?
-Experiment.

56:16.677 --> 56:20.289
-What kind of experiment?
-Water experiment.

56:32.389 --> 56:34.391
That's freaky.

56:34.434 --> 56:35.609
I'll say.

56:41.659 --> 56:43.400
What's that?

56:43.443 --> 56:44.662
It's a triangle.

56:44.705 --> 56:46.403
I'm checking the angles.

56:46.446 --> 56:48.492
Why you want to check angles?

56:48.535 --> 56:51.016
These are all very
heads-up questions, honey.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.979
Huh.

57:00.460 --> 57:02.593
Does this wall
look right to you?

57:02.636 --> 57:04.464
Um...

57:04.508 --> 57:08.294
it looks like a wall to me.

57:08.337 --> 57:10.688
Can't tell from in here.

57:17.172 --> 57:20.132
What are you looking for?

57:20.175 --> 57:22.395
I don't know.

57:23.222 --> 57:24.789
ELLA:
16, seven,

57:24.832 --> 57:26.791
12, zero.

57:26.834 --> 57:28.140
Honey, honey, honey.

57:28.183 --> 57:29.881
-You taught me that.

57:29.924 --> 57:32.927
16! 17! 18!

57:32.971 --> 57:34.625
-Okay, you got me.
-One!

57:34.668 --> 57:36.191
Yay!

57:41.936 --> 57:44.025
-Hang on tight, honey.
-Okay.

57:45.679 --> 57:48.116
-Don't let go.
-Okay.

57:51.511 --> 57:53.208
26 feet.

57:53.252 --> 57:55.472
-Hold on tight.
-Okay.

58:01.782 --> 58:03.480
21.

58:04.350 --> 58:05.786
Are you at the corner?

58:05.830 --> 58:07.440
-Yeah.
-You sure?

58:07.484 --> 58:08.615
Yeah.

58:08.659 --> 58:09.703
You can let go.

58:10.748 --> 58:12.445
What does it say?

58:12.489 --> 58:16.014
Says this room is
five feet longer on the inside

58:16.057 --> 58:18.103
than it is on the outside.

58:20.366 --> 58:22.716
Wait. How does that work?

58:24.065 --> 58:25.763
It doesn't.

58:25.806 --> 58:27.199
I'm cold.

58:27.242 --> 58:28.722
Get your coat on, hon.

58:28.766 --> 58:30.158
Okay.

59:08.632 --> 59:10.285
Ella?

59:12.940 --> 59:14.551
Ella.

59:21.993 --> 59:23.777
Ella.

59:27.781 --> 59:30.871
So not in the mood
for hide-and-seek.

59:34.092 --> 59:36.137
Ella!

59:43.667 --> 59:45.407
Ella.

59:47.888 --> 59:49.890
I give up, honey.

59:49.934 --> 59:51.457
You win.

59:51.500 --> 59:53.372
Ella.

59:59.552 --> 1:00:01.206
Ella?

1:00:12.304 --> 1:00:13.914
Okay, Ella, it's not funny.

1:00:13.958 --> 1:00:15.655
Come out, please.

1:00:17.265 --> 1:00:18.919
ELLA:
Baba?

1:00:25.883 --> 1:00:27.624
Baba.

1:00:31.715 --> 1:00:33.455
Ella.

1:00:45.729 --> 1:00:47.513
What the hell?

1:01:14.496 --> 1:01:16.498
ELLA :
Baba?

1:01:18.196 --> 1:01:20.241
Are you there?

1:01:27.988 --> 1:01:29.555
Baba?

1:01:44.570 --> 1:01:46.354
Ella?

1:01:59.628 --> 1:02:01.369
Oh, God.

1:02:21.825 --> 1:02:23.652
Hello?

1:02:26.655 --> 1:02:29.310
Is anybody down here?

1:02:34.011 --> 1:02:36.230
I got lost.

1:02:52.333 --> 1:02:54.509
Hello?

1:03:00.124 --> 1:03:01.821
Who are you?

1:03:06.739 --> 1:03:08.523
Can you hear me?

1:03:10.047 --> 1:03:12.397
Are you okay?

1:03:17.837 --> 1:03:19.491
Ella.

1:03:23.147 --> 1:03:26.803
What an innocent face.

1:03:29.588 --> 1:03:31.895
We don't get that much here.

1:03:32.939 --> 1:03:34.288
Such a lucky daddy.

1:03:34.332 --> 1:03:38.205
I bet you'd stay with him
forever, wouldn't you?

1:03:44.429 --> 1:03:46.692
-Ella!
-ELLA: Baba!

1:03:49.913 --> 1:03:53.220
-Daddy, where are you?

1:03:53.264 --> 1:03:54.874
Ella?

1:03:54.918 --> 1:03:57.137
-Ella!
-Baba, I'm scared.

1:03:57.181 --> 1:03:58.312
Stay back from the door!

1:03:59.618 --> 1:04:01.838
Baba, please, please.

1:04:01.881 --> 1:04:03.100
Baba!

1:04:06.973 --> 1:04:09.106
Oh, Jesus.

1:04:09.149 --> 1:04:11.412
Ella. Honey, are you okay?

1:04:11.456 --> 1:04:14.024
-I got... I got lost.
-Oh, baby.

1:04:14.067 --> 1:04:15.503
I got lost in the house.

1:04:15.547 --> 1:04:17.070
I know. I know.
I got you now.

1:04:17.114 --> 1:04:18.985
-I was looking for you
everywhere. -I know.

1:04:19.029 --> 1:04:20.944
I know, my love.
It's okay. It's okay.

1:04:20.987 --> 1:04:23.076
-I was scared.
-I know. I know.

1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:25.383
-I got you.
-I couldn't find you.

1:04:25.426 --> 1:04:27.037
I got you now.

1:04:30.649 --> 1:04:33.173
You're okay now.
All right?

1:04:33.217 --> 1:04:37.569
You and me, we're not getting
out of each other's sight again.

1:04:37.612 --> 1:04:39.353
All right?
That's a deal.

1:04:39.397 --> 1:04:41.181
I want to go home.

1:04:42.226 --> 1:04:43.314
We will.

1:04:43.357 --> 1:04:45.403
-Promise?
-Yeah. Yep.

1:04:45.446 --> 1:04:47.492
Yeah. I promise.

1:04:47.535 --> 1:04:49.189
-I'm just gonna call...
-Wait!

1:04:49.233 --> 1:04:51.757
Okay, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm just gonna call your mom,

1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:53.498
and she's gonna come right now,

1:04:53.541 --> 1:04:56.196
and she's gonna pick us up,
okay?

1:04:58.372 --> 1:04:59.591
SUSANNA :
Hey, it's me.

1:04:59.634 --> 1:05:01.114
Um, leave me a message.

1:05:02.507 --> 1:05:04.988
Her phone is off
or she's out of range.

1:05:05.031 --> 1:05:07.599
Why don't you call
her other phone?

1:05:10.689 --> 1:05:13.735
Uh... I don't have that number.

1:05:14.780 --> 1:05:16.695
Oh.

1:05:16.738 --> 1:05:19.480
All right,
I-I'm gonna try her again.

1:05:20.917 --> 1:05:23.745
Hey, it's me.
Um, leave me a message.

1:05:23.789 --> 1:05:26.226
THEO:
Hey, uh, it's me.

1:05:26.270 --> 1:05:28.141
Call me when you get this,

1:05:28.185 --> 1:05:30.230
as soon as you get it.

1:05:33.146 --> 1:05:35.757
Uh, okay.

1:05:35.801 --> 1:05:38.499
This is not a problem.

1:05:38.543 --> 1:05:40.762
ELLA:
Okay.

1:05:42.851 --> 1:05:45.942
All right, yeah, it's a...
it's a little bit of a problem.

1:05:48.118 --> 1:05:50.076
But I got an idea.

1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:51.556
Aha!

1:05:51.599 --> 1:05:53.123
All right.

1:05:53.166 --> 1:05:54.428
We are out of here.

1:05:54.472 --> 1:05:57.214
We are so out of here.

1:06:07.702 --> 1:06:08.877
They don't answer?

1:06:08.921 --> 1:06:10.401
Uh, just give him a minute.

1:06:10.444 --> 1:06:12.272
This guy's kind of slow.

1:06:21.064 --> 1:06:22.021
Hello.

1:06:22.065 --> 1:06:24.284
Hello. Hi.
Uh, this is Theo Conroy.

1:06:24.328 --> 1:06:25.851
I was in the other day.

1:06:25.894 --> 1:06:29.420
Uh, we-we rented the house
u-up the hill.

1:06:29.463 --> 1:06:30.943
Where?

1:06:30.987 --> 1:06:32.553
Stetler. The Stetler house.

1:06:32.597 --> 1:06:34.294
We rented Stetler's house.

1:06:34.338 --> 1:06:36.296
I remember.

1:06:36.340 --> 1:06:38.864
-We need a taxi.
-A what?

1:06:38.907 --> 1:06:40.083
A taxi.

1:06:40.126 --> 1:06:42.737
W-We need somebody
to come pick us up.

1:06:42.781 --> 1:06:45.088
There are no taxis around here.

1:06:45.131 --> 1:06:46.350
Well, where, then?

1:06:46.393 --> 1:06:47.742
Marlborough Inn, maybe.

1:06:47.786 --> 1:06:49.179
Unless he's still on holiday.

1:06:49.222 --> 1:06:52.573
Okay, uh, could you give me
that number, please?

1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:54.836
Hello?

1:06:54.880 --> 1:06:57.970
Did you try the triangle?

1:07:00.799 --> 1:07:02.496
THEO :
Yes.

1:07:02.540 --> 1:07:04.542
I tried the triangle.

1:07:04.585 --> 1:07:07.327
They never fit
the angles up there.

1:07:07.371 --> 1:07:09.112
Why not?

1:07:09.155 --> 1:07:10.983
What is this place?

1:07:11.027 --> 1:07:13.899
Somebody from here, Hans Eagly,

1:07:13.942 --> 1:07:15.988
he owns the Lindenhof.

1:07:16.032 --> 1:07:20.297
He said an ant doesn't know
what a cathedral is

1:07:20.340 --> 1:07:23.648
or a power plant or a volcano.

1:07:23.691 --> 1:07:26.607
It's the same with that house.

1:07:26.651 --> 1:07:29.654
You don't know
what you can't know.

1:07:31.743 --> 1:07:33.397
Are you still there?

1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:34.746
We need a taxi now.

1:07:34.789 --> 1:07:36.269
Don't shout at me.

1:07:36.313 --> 1:07:37.836
I'm not... shouting.

1:07:37.879 --> 1:07:40.578
There was a different house
before that one.

1:07:40.621 --> 1:07:42.580
What sort of house?

1:07:42.623 --> 1:07:44.364
Just different.

1:07:44.408 --> 1:07:47.280
And before that, a tower.

1:07:47.324 --> 1:07:48.412
Tower?

1:07:48.455 --> 1:07:50.327
It's a legend.

1:07:50.370 --> 1:07:54.374
The Devil builds a tower
to collect souls,

1:07:54.418 --> 1:07:56.637
and God destroys it.

1:07:56.681 --> 1:08:01.164
But the Devil just builds it up
again and again.

1:08:01.207 --> 1:08:04.602
People have always stayed
in that house.

1:08:04.645 --> 1:08:06.125
Some don't leave.

1:08:06.169 --> 1:08:08.780
The right ones
usually find the place.

1:08:08.823 --> 1:08:11.261
Or perhaps it's
the other way around.

1:08:11.304 --> 1:08:13.393
The place finds them.

1:08:13.437 --> 1:08:15.265
We need to leave now.

1:08:16.527 --> 1:08:18.485
That's not up to me.

1:08:18.529 --> 1:08:20.357
-Hello?

1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:21.358
Hello!

1:08:21.401 --> 1:08:23.621
STETLER:
I'm here.

1:08:23.664 --> 1:08:26.145
I'm always here.

1:08:31.977 --> 1:08:33.935
-How far is the village?
-It's pretty far.

1:08:33.979 --> 1:08:36.155
It's about four miles.

1:08:36.199 --> 1:08:37.461
But it's dark.

1:08:37.504 --> 1:08:39.637
-Yep.
-And cold.

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:41.421
Would you rather stay here?

1:08:41.465 --> 1:08:43.858
-No.
-Me, neither.

1:08:45.164 --> 1:08:47.210
-But what about our stuff?
-We'll get new stuff.

1:08:50.430 --> 1:08:51.866
Oh, no.

1:08:53.694 --> 1:08:55.696
Why don't you unlock the door?

1:09:08.448 --> 1:09:10.624
ELLA:
Are you sure you know the way?

1:09:10.668 --> 1:09:13.192
THEO:
Yep. Just one road,

1:09:13.236 --> 1:09:15.760
right down straight into town.

1:09:21.244 --> 1:09:23.463
ELLA : There's
somebody inside the house.

1:09:29.382 --> 1:09:30.470
Okay, up.

1:09:31.689 --> 1:09:33.212
Baba, what's happening?

1:09:33.256 --> 1:09:34.735
Let's go.

1:09:42.874 --> 1:09:44.832
-ELLA: I'm cold.
-THEO: I know.

1:09:44.876 --> 1:09:47.357
THEO:
It's cold, but we're okay.

1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:48.793
ELLA:
I can walk.

1:09:48.836 --> 1:09:50.882
THEO:
I got you, honey. I got you.

1:09:53.493 --> 1:09:55.756
ELLA:
It's freezing.

1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:58.194
THEO:
Hey. You're doing great.

1:10:01.806 --> 1:10:03.286
Honey, I-I got to
put you down, okay?

1:10:03.329 --> 1:10:04.939
-ELLA: Okay.

1:10:09.074 --> 1:10:10.771
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

1:10:10.815 --> 1:10:14.166
Yeah. Just one road,
right into town.

1:10:17.125 --> 1:10:19.345
-ELLA: What was that?

1:10:24.176 --> 1:10:25.873
-What was that?
-Uh, it was nothing, honey.

1:10:25.917 --> 1:10:27.092
It was just an animal, animal.

1:10:27.135 --> 1:10:29.747
-Okay.
-Just a-a deer, something.

1:10:29.790 --> 1:10:31.575
Okay, up you go.

1:10:46.807 --> 1:10:48.722
THEO:
Almost there, honey.

1:10:48.766 --> 1:10:50.246
Not much further.

1:10:50.289 --> 1:10:53.161
ELLA:
I can't... I can't feel my toes.

1:10:53.205 --> 1:10:55.251
THEO:
Maybe they'll have a fire.

1:10:58.036 --> 1:11:01.082
ELLA: I've never been
this c-cold before.

1:11:01.126 --> 1:11:03.215
THEO:
You never lived in Chicago.

1:11:03.259 --> 1:11:05.043
ELLA:
How much farther is it?

1:11:05.086 --> 1:11:07.306
THEO:
I'm starting to see lights.

1:11:07.350 --> 1:11:09.439
ELLA:
It's... cold.

1:11:09.482 --> 1:11:10.875
Yeah.

1:11:12.355 --> 1:11:14.835
I'm definitely seeing
some lights.

1:11:17.925 --> 1:11:19.710
We made it.

1:11:21.973 --> 1:11:23.801
We did it.

1:11:23.844 --> 1:11:25.846
We did it, honey.

1:11:25.890 --> 1:11:28.196
We're there.

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:29.807
We're...

1:11:34.028 --> 1:11:36.161
We're back.

1:11:36.204 --> 1:11:38.206
What?

1:11:44.561 --> 1:11:45.649
We're back.

1:11:45.692 --> 1:11:46.867
But...

1:11:46.911 --> 1:11:50.088
But we were going down
the whole time.

1:11:50.131 --> 1:11:52.003
THEO: I'll explain it to you
in the morning.

1:11:52.046 --> 1:11:54.353
- It's complicated.
-No, it isn't.

1:11:54.397 --> 1:11:58.183
We were walking d-down
the whole time.

1:11:58.226 --> 1:12:00.490
I don't want to go in there.

1:12:00.533 --> 1:12:01.926
We don't have a choice.

1:12:01.969 --> 1:12:03.449
I'm not going in there.

1:12:03.493 --> 1:12:06.234
-Honey...
-I hate that house!

1:12:06.278 --> 1:12:09.020
-It's too cold out here, honey.
-No. No!

1:12:09.063 --> 1:12:12.284
Your mom's gonna be here
in the morning with the car.

1:12:12.328 --> 1:12:13.938
Please don't make me
go in there.

1:12:15.766 --> 1:12:17.985
Listen to me.

1:12:19.813 --> 1:12:22.990
We would not make it out here.

1:12:23.034 --> 1:12:25.166
Not all night.

1:12:25.210 --> 1:12:27.386
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

1:12:30.563 --> 1:12:33.523
I will protect you.

1:12:33.566 --> 1:12:35.655
I'm gonna make sure...

1:12:35.699 --> 1:12:38.136
that nothing happens to you.

1:12:38.179 --> 1:12:40.704
I'm gonna protect you.

1:12:40.747 --> 1:12:43.097
Okay? Do you trust me?

1:12:43.141 --> 1:12:45.665
I-I trust you.

1:12:45.709 --> 1:12:47.667
One more night.

1:12:47.711 --> 1:12:49.539
Just one more night.

1:12:49.582 --> 1:12:50.888
We can do it.

1:12:50.931 --> 1:12:53.673
Okay?
Let's go. Let's go.

1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:10.908
THEO:
Okay? Feeling better?

1:13:10.951 --> 1:13:12.692
It's warm now, right?

1:13:12.736 --> 1:13:14.172
I'm not going anywhere.

1:13:14.215 --> 1:13:16.957
Just try and get some sleep,
honey.

1:13:17.784 --> 1:13:19.133
Daddy?

1:13:19.177 --> 1:13:20.613
Yes, my love.

1:13:20.657 --> 1:13:22.398
You still love Mommy?

1:13:22.441 --> 1:13:23.703
Yeah.

1:13:23.747 --> 1:13:25.488
I do.

1:13:25.531 --> 1:13:27.751
But not enough?

1:13:27.794 --> 1:13:30.667
Well, s-sweetie, uh...

1:13:30.710 --> 1:13:34.714
I never really deserved
to have your mom.

1:13:34.758 --> 1:13:37.630
What about me?

1:13:39.023 --> 1:13:40.285
What about you?

1:13:40.328 --> 1:13:43.114
Do you love me enough?

1:13:44.898 --> 1:13:47.466
Aw.

1:13:47.510 --> 1:13:49.729
You know...

1:13:49.773 --> 1:13:51.514
when I was young...

1:13:51.557 --> 1:13:55.692
things came pretty easy for me,

1:13:55.735 --> 1:13:58.129
and-and-and really quick, like,

1:13:58.172 --> 1:14:00.044
-success and money.

1:14:00.087 --> 1:14:01.741
Stuff like that.

1:14:01.785 --> 1:14:03.743
And I think I...

1:14:03.787 --> 1:14:05.919
I kind of lost track

1:14:05.963 --> 1:14:09.662
of who I was, you know, and...

1:14:09.706 --> 1:14:14.885
I became someone that
I wasn't really proud of.

1:14:14.928 --> 1:14:17.409
Everything in my life just...

1:14:17.453 --> 1:14:21.500
just came too easy
and too quick.

1:14:23.023 --> 1:14:24.982
Except for you.

1:14:25.025 --> 1:14:28.551
The one thing that mattered.

1:14:28.594 --> 1:14:30.944
For you, I had to wait.

1:14:30.988 --> 1:14:33.860
Until you were old?

1:14:35.296 --> 1:14:37.429
Hey, lady, I'm not that old.

1:14:41.912 --> 1:14:46.090
I love you much more
than enough.

1:14:46.133 --> 1:14:49.049
I love you, Baba.

1:15:46.629 --> 1:15:48.152
Ella!

1:15:56.639 --> 1:15:58.118
Ella. Ella!

1:15:58.162 --> 1:16:00.599
ELLA :
Baba!

1:16:01.905 --> 1:16:03.297
THEO:
Ella?

1:16:05.909 --> 1:16:07.563
Ella.

1:17:05.708 --> 1:17:07.274
Ella!

1:17:20.244 --> 1:17:22.376
Ella!

1:18:18.302 --> 1:18:19.956
-THEO: Wow.

1:18:19.999 --> 1:18:21.392
Seems bigger on the inside.

1:18:21.435 --> 1:18:23.220
-Oh, my God.
-Way bigger.

1:18:23.263 --> 1:18:25.004
Oh, I love it.

1:18:25.048 --> 1:18:26.745
There's no service, though.

1:18:26.789 --> 1:18:28.660
-THEO: You hear that?
-Hey!

1:18:28.704 --> 1:18:29.530
What?

1:18:29.574 --> 1:18:31.619
-Hey!
-The quiet.

1:18:31.663 --> 1:18:33.883
-ELLA: Baba!

1:18:35.275 --> 1:18:36.581
Hello.

1:18:36.624 --> 1:18:39.758
STETLER:
You're not going anywhere.

1:18:43.936 --> 1:18:45.764
THEO:
Hey, I'm back.

1:18:47.070 --> 1:18:48.419
Hey.

1:18:48.462 --> 1:18:50.029
ELLA: Sorry that
happened to you, Baba.

1:18:52.249 --> 1:18:54.730
ELLA:
Does everyone go to Heaven?

1:18:56.819 --> 1:18:59.212
THEO :
That's what they say.

1:18:59.256 --> 1:19:01.737
Where are you?

1:19:04.130 --> 1:19:07.394
Oh, my God, Ella,
you have to come up here.

1:19:07.438 --> 1:19:09.309
Your bed is the size of...

1:19:38.904 --> 1:19:40.297
Ella.

1:19:42.908 --> 1:19:44.605
Ella.

1:19:47.695 --> 1:19:49.132
Ella.

1:19:49.175 --> 1:19:51.221
Where are you?

1:20:01.797 --> 1:20:03.842
Susanna?

1:20:03.886 --> 1:20:06.018
-Susanna!

1:20:12.024 --> 1:20:13.504
THEO:
Wow.

1:20:13.547 --> 1:20:14.635
Seems bigger on the inside.

1:20:14.679 --> 1:20:15.985
-Oh, my God.
-Way bigger.

1:20:27.170 --> 1:20:29.259
Your name Stetler?

1:20:29.302 --> 1:20:31.914
I got a lot of names.

1:20:31.957 --> 1:20:33.437
Where's Ella?

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:36.222
A lot of faces.

1:20:36.266 --> 1:20:38.485
And a lot of houses.

1:20:38.529 --> 1:20:41.706
Been a room here for you
for a long time.

1:20:41.749 --> 1:20:44.100
-Where is she?
-Where you belong.

1:20:44.143 --> 1:20:46.319
With me.

1:20:46.363 --> 1:20:47.712
ELLA:
Baba!

1:20:47.755 --> 1:20:49.409
In here!

1:20:49.453 --> 1:20:51.672
Baba, I'm scared! I'm here!

1:20:51.716 --> 1:20:55.546
-Ella! Ella!
-Please find me. Please find me.

1:20:55.589 --> 1:20:56.808
Ella. Ella.

1:20:56.852 --> 1:20:59.245
ELLA:
It's hot in here!

1:20:59.289 --> 1:21:01.160
Let her go.

1:21:01.204 --> 1:21:02.814
Such a lucky daddy.

1:21:03.728 --> 1:21:05.382
She would do anything for you.

1:21:05.425 --> 1:21:07.906
Let her go, you son of a bitch.

1:21:07.950 --> 1:21:09.995
She'd even stay.

1:21:11.954 --> 1:21:13.912
Let her go. Let her go!

1:21:13.956 --> 1:21:15.044
Think of it.

1:21:15.087 --> 1:21:17.568
Together forever.

1:21:17.611 --> 1:21:20.049
Just you and her...

1:21:20.092 --> 1:21:22.138
and a lie.

1:21:22.181 --> 1:21:23.574
She's innocent.

1:21:23.617 --> 1:21:25.228
Sure she is.

1:21:25.271 --> 1:21:27.273
But she's with you.

1:21:27.317 --> 1:21:28.971
I didn't do it!

1:21:29.580 --> 1:21:31.060
I didn't do it!

1:21:31.103 --> 1:21:33.540
ELLA:
Daddy, I don't know where I am!

1:21:33.584 --> 1:21:35.803
Baba, please, please!

1:21:36.500 --> 1:21:38.632
Let her go!

1:21:47.641 --> 1:21:49.208
The sins of the fathers...

1:21:49.252 --> 1:21:50.949
I didn't do it!

1:21:54.387 --> 1:21:56.215
...come down on the kids.

1:21:56.259 --> 1:21:58.435
But I... didn't...

1:21:58.478 --> 1:21:59.871
do it!

1:22:03.309 --> 1:22:06.530
That's the problem with mirrors.

1:22:08.575 --> 1:22:11.665
They always show you yourself.

1:22:20.152 --> 1:22:22.024
Please.

1:22:22.067 --> 1:22:24.287
Please let her go.
Please let her go.

1:22:24.330 --> 1:22:25.810
Please, please, please, please.

1:22:25.853 --> 1:22:27.768
Me?

1:22:27.812 --> 1:22:30.858
The only one
keeping her here is you.

1:22:35.689 --> 1:22:37.300
I can't do it.

1:22:37.343 --> 1:22:39.171
I can't do this.

1:22:40.303 --> 1:22:41.608
I can't do this.

1:22:41.652 --> 1:22:43.001
I can't do it anymore.

1:22:43.045 --> 1:22:44.307
I can't.

1:22:44.350 --> 1:22:46.700
I can't do this.
I-I can't do it.

1:22:46.744 --> 1:22:48.833
I can't do this.

1:22:52.445 --> 1:22:56.580
Then you know what
you've got to do, don't you?

1:23:02.325 --> 1:23:03.935
ELLA:
Baba?

1:23:05.458 --> 1:23:07.112
Oh... Ella.

1:23:07.156 --> 1:23:08.766
Oh, honey.

1:23:10.202 --> 1:23:12.030
Oh, I am so sorry.

1:23:12.074 --> 1:23:14.511
Ella, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1:23:14.554 --> 1:23:16.556
What for?

1:23:18.384 --> 1:23:20.343
For...

1:23:20.386 --> 1:23:22.736
not being what you think I am.

1:23:22.780 --> 1:23:25.826
But... I love you
no matter what.

1:23:25.870 --> 1:23:28.873
Don't you know that yet?

1:23:38.317 --> 1:23:39.971
Is it time to go home?

1:23:48.849 --> 1:23:51.156
It is, for you and Mommy.

1:23:57.075 --> 1:23:58.685
Come on.

1:24:19.271 --> 1:24:21.012
Hi, Mommy.

1:25:06.318 --> 1:25:08.277
Where is her stuff?

1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:10.888
I'll send it. Later.

1:25:13.847 --> 1:25:16.676
You're not coming with us?

1:25:17.634 --> 1:25:19.940
It'll never let me.

1:25:19.984 --> 1:25:21.855
I'd end up right back here.

1:25:21.899 --> 1:25:24.467
And if you were with me,
you would, too.

1:25:24.510 --> 1:25:26.164
I belong here.

1:25:26.208 --> 1:25:30.037
Can we just try
and work through it?

1:25:31.517 --> 1:25:32.997
I love you.

1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:35.173
I love you so much.

1:25:36.653 --> 1:25:38.394
But...

1:25:38.437 --> 1:25:40.613
I always knew that
you were only borrowed.

1:25:40.657 --> 1:25:43.703
Stop talking crazy.

1:25:44.704 --> 1:25:46.793
Just get in the car,

1:25:46.837 --> 1:25:49.448
and we can talk about it.

1:25:49.492 --> 1:25:51.842
I killed her, Suse.

1:25:58.544 --> 1:26:00.720
I let her drown.

1:26:04.202 --> 1:26:06.465
I could've pulled her out,

1:26:06.509 --> 1:26:08.337
and I didn't.

1:26:11.383 --> 1:26:13.080
I watched her die.

1:26:15.213 --> 1:26:18.869
All those years being so angry,

1:26:18.912 --> 1:26:22.699
hating her so much, and...

1:26:22.742 --> 1:26:24.962
keeping it inside.

1:26:26.355 --> 1:26:28.748
I should've left...

1:26:29.575 --> 1:26:31.882
...years before.

1:26:32.926 --> 1:26:34.885
But I didn't.

1:26:40.412 --> 1:26:42.371
I belong...

1:26:42.414 --> 1:26:44.155
right here.

1:26:49.204 --> 1:26:51.989
Can't run away from your shadow.

1:26:57.255 --> 1:27:01.041
ELLA : There's
somebody inside the house.

1:27:06.656 --> 1:27:08.397
Baba, what's happening?

1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:10.181
THEO:
Let's go.

1:27:19.712 --> 1:27:23.150
SHOPKEEPER: People have always
stayed in that house.

1:27:23.194 --> 1:27:26.241
Some don't leave.

1:27:26.284 --> 1:27:29.592
The right ones
usually find the place.

1:27:29.635 --> 1:27:32.029
Or maybe it's
the other way around.

1:27:34.118 --> 1:27:36.207
The place finds them.
