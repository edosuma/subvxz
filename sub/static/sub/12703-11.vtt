is what you write

It's the kiss of death.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.357
No. I probably didn't see her,

except to sign the book.

24:51.707 --> 24:54.013
I mean, this is a big school.

four classes

24:55.711 --> 24:58.018

So no one noticed her,
and now she's invisible.

he's the hero, right?

25:49.634 --> 25:52.115
Exactly.
So what do we call him?
