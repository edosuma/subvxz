WEBVTT

00:05.413 --> 00:07.859
I never thought we'd
get back to this table.

00:08.472 --> 00:10.370
I can't tell you how good it felt

00:10.372 --> 00:12.068
to have dinner together again.

00:14.167 --> 00:16.969
We hadn't done that since
the night of the accident.

00:16.980 --> 00:18.036
Kitty!

00:22.997 --> 00:24.724
To be honest...

00:24.820 --> 00:27.141
Sometimes I felt like
we'd never get over it.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.033
But somehow we did.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.255
It took a while, though.

00:32.769 --> 00:34.624
Sarah just tried to move on.

00:35.003 --> 00:37.770
Kevin was busy trying to save
every family in the world

00:37.779 --> 00:39.077
except ours.

00:40.488 --> 00:41.662
Mom...

00:42.445 --> 00:44.781
It was like she
became somebody else.

00:46.073 --> 00:48.410
But someone came home

00:48.413 --> 00:50.012
and turned out to be a hero...

00:50.773 --> 00:52.484
In more ways than one.

00:54.493 --> 00:55.820
And as for me...

00:57.641 --> 00:58.740
I had to make a choice

00:58.741 --> 01:00.867
that no one should
ever have to make.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.765
Okay. I do not see you.

01:09.325 --> 01:11.850
I'm at the corner of
3rd and Figueroa, babe.

01:11.853 --> 01:13.070
Well, so am I.

01:13.151 --> 01:14.930
Luc, I am running late.

01:14.933 --> 01:17.490
This is the biggest business
meeting of my career.

01:17.496 --> 01:20.121
I don't have any
time to waste. Just...

01:20.292 --> 01:21.333
just look up.

01:21.878 --> 01:23.316
Hmm?

01:24.068 --> 01:25.573
Oh, my God.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.892
So... how does it look?

01:29.117 --> 01:30.290
Huge.

01:30.295 --> 01:33.048
I can't believe they already
hung it. Oh, it's hung.

01:33.649 --> 01:37.900
It's gonna be a real nice
icebreaker at p.T.A. Meetings.

01:37.904 --> 01:39.310
I'm afraid to leave the house now.

01:39.320 --> 01:41.816
Do me a favor? Don't.

01:43.108 --> 01:44.549
All right, Mateo. Listen up.

01:45.069 --> 01:48.100
When the judge addresses you,
you speak clearly and politely.

01:48.101 --> 01:50.000
So much as blink rudely,

01:50.005 --> 01:52.068
he will ship your
butt to juvenile hall.

01:52.612 --> 01:53.187
Gum.

01:53.188 --> 01:54.300
* Puppeteer for kings *

01:54.301 --> 01:57.739
* And you've had enough *

01:57.829 --> 02:00.515
* But the search ends *

02:00.520 --> 02:01.335
* Here *

02:01.877 --> 02:03.719
* Where the night *

02:03.720 --> 02:05.352
* Is totally clear *

02:08.639 --> 02:10.816
This is Kitty. Leave a message.

02:11.632 --> 02:15.353
Kitty, hi. I just... I wanted
to make sure that you were...

02:15.447 --> 02:17.187
you were coming to
the dinner tonight.

02:17.188 --> 02:20.015
Uh, Scotty and Saul are-
are planning such a nice meal.

02:20.016 --> 02:21.825
And so... call me.

02:21.904 --> 02:23.520
I'll talk to you later.
See you tonight.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.894
Hi. Hi. Was that a personal
conversation you were having?

02:27.895 --> 02:30.848
Yes, Zoe. That was
a personal call.

02:30.849 --> 02:33.463
And I have to leave
early like I told you,

02:33.464 --> 02:35.400
so I-I hope you don't get upset.

02:35.457 --> 02:36.784
Well, you're here now...

02:37.233 --> 02:38.576
And there are customers waiting.

02:38.623 --> 02:39.536
Okay.

02:46.308 --> 02:48.936
Your honor, to ship my
client off to juvenile hall

02:48.944 --> 02:50.868
is to say that our
criminal justice system

02:50.869 --> 02:54.383
places more value on
the punishment of a boy

02:54.384 --> 02:56.992
than it does on the redemptive
value of a real home.

02:57.773 --> 03:00.627
Mateo's father is here today,

03:00.628 --> 03:02.820
and he is prepared
to take him home.

03:03.222 --> 03:04.026
I urge your honor,

03:04.027 --> 03:06.036
when you rule on this case,
to let your understanding

03:06.037 --> 03:07.977
of the insignificance
of Mateo's crime

03:08.036 --> 03:10.381
be outweighed by your belief

03:10.399 --> 03:13.567
in the monumental
importance of family.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.038
Thank you.

03:17.193 --> 03:18.217
Okay, then.

03:19.653 --> 03:20.974
I am ruling that the defendant

03:20.975 --> 03:23.403
shall return to the
custody of his father,

03:23.404 --> 03:25.388
where he will behave himself.

03:26.644 --> 03:27.797
Is that clear?

03:28.396 --> 03:30.900
* Oh, and now you... *

03:31.400 --> 03:32.472
Next case.

03:32.691 --> 03:35.600
* You can steer *

03:35.604 --> 03:37.284
I would've been fine in juvie.

03:37.945 --> 03:39.512
Trust me. You wouldn't have.

03:41.403 --> 03:42.701
Do you have any kids?

03:44.732 --> 03:46.570
Uh, no. No, I don't.

03:46.571 --> 03:48.981
Um, I think your father's waiting.

03:49.006 --> 03:49.915
You should go.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:00.504 --> 04:01.864
Cafe 4-2-9.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.443
Yeah. Uh, let me check that.

04:04.444 --> 04:08.496
Schiffman,
s-c... s-c-h-i-f-f-m-a-n,

04:08.497 --> 04:10.260
Thursday for 8:00.

04:10.281 --> 04:12.852
Yes, we've got you right here.
Yes, that'll be great.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.611
Have you got a vase
I can put this in?

04:14.612 --> 04:15.709
Hang on a second, please.
Any vase will do.

04:15.828 --> 04:20.027
If... except that one.
It's horrible. Any other vase...

04:20.059 --> 04:21.726
could you hang on a second,
please, Mrs. Schiffman?

04:21.726 --> 04:22.972
-Come on. It's not much better.
-I will, uh,

04:22.973 --> 04:25.196
tell Scotty you like
the polenta. Very good.

04:25.197 --> 04:27.509
Okay. Thanks.
See you Thursday at 8:00.

04:27.593 --> 04:28.809
- Yeah, bye. 
- Let's get this...

04:30.876 --> 04:32.170
Lovely flowers.

04:32.171 --> 04:33.052
Thank you.

04:33.928 --> 04:35.699
Okay, where should we put these?
Where are we gonna sit?

04:35.700 --> 04:37.329
We can put the tables
together in the middle.

04:37.389 --> 04:39.427
Why don't I take this? Okay,
let's put the tables together, then.

04:39.428 --> 04:41.476
Nora, why are we having
this dinner here,

04:41.477 --> 04:45.028
by the way? Because I
was working all day,

04:45.029 --> 04:46.947
and I couldn't put
it together. Really?

04:46.948 --> 04:48.984
That's why. I see.
I think it's because you're hoping

04:49.008 --> 04:50.119
that everybody is in public,

04:50.120 --> 04:52.667
that it won't turn into
d-day with entrees.

04:52.668 --> 04:53.301
You're also forgetting

04:53.320 --> 04:55.130
that the restaurant
is closed on Monday.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.776
Oh, damn it. What is that?
This is a two top.

04:59.719 --> 05:00.371
Ugh!

05:00.372 --> 05:03.348
Nora, Nora, Nora, please,
just relax. Come on.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.149
He's coming home safe and sound.

05:05.150 --> 05:06.540
It's a really good start.

05:08.992 --> 05:10.192
Yes.

05:10.813 --> 05:13.614
Yes, yes, yes.
That's a really good start.

05:14.308 --> 05:17.203
He's coming back safe
and sound, I hope.

05:17.697 --> 05:20.320
Last time he came home,
he was injured.

05:20.384 --> 05:21.793
The time before that,

05:22.186 --> 05:24.283
he came home with a drug problem.

05:25.276 --> 05:27.448
I just hope he is safe and sound.

05:27.449 --> 05:29.496
Nora, it was his
decision to go back,

05:30.661 --> 05:32.485
and there was nothing
you could do about it.

05:33.304 --> 05:35.689
Mom, there's nothing
you can do. I'm fine.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.383
But you're not fine, Justin.
Look at you. You're a mess.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.512
So what? I'm a mess, all right?

05:41.513 --> 05:43.448
Like, what... what the hell
difference does that make?

05:43.449 --> 05:45.849
It makes a difference.
It makes a difference.

05:45.850 --> 05:47.393
Justin, this is life.

05:47.394 --> 05:49.167
You have a family.
You have a wife.

05:49.168 --> 05:51.200
The accident was four weeks ago.

05:51.243 --> 05:53.064
You have to get up off
this couch and just...

05:53.065 --> 05:54.921
and wh... and what, mom, move on?

05:55.099 --> 05:58.475
Like, move on. Do... do you think
I like who I am right now?

05:58.845 --> 06:01.419
I left Robert on the
side of the road.

06:01.420 --> 06:03.255
No one is blaming you.

06:03.256 --> 06:05.415
It doesn't matter, mom.
I blame me.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.486
Holly is alive because of you.

06:08.487 --> 06:10.168
Well, I'm not helping
her now, mom.

06:10.931 --> 06:12.531
Rebecca and I can barely
look at each other,

06:12.532 --> 06:13.951
and the only thing I want to do,

06:13.952 --> 06:17.219
the only thing that makes sense to me,
nobody can understand.

06:17.220 --> 06:18.571
Rebecca said she's gonna leave me

06:18.572 --> 06:19.912
if I even consider going off

06:19.913 --> 06:23.076
to war... because it makes
no sense! It's crazy.

06:23.077 --> 06:24.565
You can't go off to war because...

06:24.566 --> 06:28.335
this is war! This is war!
Where I am right now, mom!

06:28.336 --> 06:30.755
And I'm not winning! I'm dying.

06:31.568 --> 06:32.895
I'm dying!

06:33.603 --> 06:35.696
And over there,
that feels like my chance

06:35.697 --> 06:36.824
to make things right again.

06:36.825 --> 06:39.607
Mom... then go! Sign up.
Go back to the army.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.875
Sail off to Iraq or Afghanistan,

06:41.876 --> 06:43.995
wherever people are
blowing each other up.

06:43.996 --> 06:47.073
If that's the only thing you
think will make you better,

06:47.377 --> 06:48.688
then go.

07:03.969 --> 07:04.900
Justin. Oh!

07:05.713 --> 07:07.360
Justin. Justin.

07:07.361 --> 07:09.128
Hey, mom. Oh, God,

07:09.252 --> 07:11.249
Justin. Come here. Oh! Oh, God.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.844
I can't believe you're safe.
It's so good to see you. Mwah.

07:13.845 --> 07:15.700
Oh, look at you. Look at you.

07:16.112 --> 07:17.460
You look great. Stop.

07:17.461 --> 07:20.048
You... you... you look different.
Different? What have I grown?

07:20.049 --> 07:23.008
Oh, don't make fun of me. Oh, God.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.028
Oh! Oh, I missed you.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

07:26.117 --> 07:27.627
Is this the whole
welcoming committee?

07:27.628 --> 07:29.683
Yes. You're gonna see everyone
at dinner tonight. Oh.

07:29.684 --> 07:32.035
They're so excited to see you.
Come on. Come on.

07:32.036 --> 07:33.691
Let's go. Get your stuff.
Oh, let me get my bag.

07:34.129 --> 07:35.985
No, ma. Come on.
I got this. I got this.

07:36.432 --> 07:37.188
Oh... whew.

07:37.189 --> 07:39.664
God. Oh, you're home.

07:39.665 --> 07:40.592
Yeah.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.696
So where do you
want me to take you,

07:43.697 --> 07:44.524
to your apartment?

07:44.525 --> 07:46.556
Uh, no, no. I'm gonna, uh,

07:46.557 --> 07:49.478
try and reach Rebecca first
before I show up. Oh, good

07:49.528 --> 07:50.961
how's Kitty? Fine.

07:50.962 --> 07:52.497
Is everything the
same with Robert?

07:52.895 --> 07:53.681
Yes.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.616
Have you spoken to Kitty about it?

07:55.935 --> 07:58.796
All the doctors say,
with... with Robert's kind of coma,

07:58.797 --> 08:00.100
- he could snap out of it at any...
- No, no, no,

08:00.156 --> 08:01.604
mom, it's been a year, okay?

08:01.605 --> 08:02.445
It's been more than a year,

08:02.446 --> 08:03.697
and maybe a doctor
said that at first,

08:03.700 --> 08:04.803
but now he's in a permanent

08:04.804 --> 08:07.868
vegetative state.
This is Kitty's life.

08:07.869 --> 08:10.765
I-I don't think it's our
place to tell her what to do.

08:10.956 --> 08:12.636
Not our place,
mom? Then whose is it?

08:14.968 --> 08:16.675
So I promise I'm
gonna talk to them

08:16.676 --> 08:18.692
about cleaning the windows,
because...

08:19.140 --> 08:21.957
We need to get as much
sunshine in here as we can.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.356
Oh, and I have a surprise for you.

08:24.576 --> 08:26.068
Justin is back.

08:26.512 --> 08:28.415
And I know he's gonna
want to come see you

08:28.416 --> 08:29.791
as soon as he can.

08:31.095 --> 08:32.168
All right.

08:33.437 --> 08:35.388
You are finished.

08:37.363 --> 08:40.563
Okay. Well, I have to go.
I have an appointment.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.005
But I will see you later.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.511
You have a good day. Mwah.

08:44.512 --> 08:45.568
I love you.

08:46.820 --> 08:47.765
Okay.

08:57.148 --> 08:58.176
You better get down here,

08:58.177 --> 09:01.260
or I am gonna drink this
whole bottle pour moi,

09:01.261 --> 09:05.100
or however the hell you say
"by myself" in French.

09:05.604 --> 09:06.820
Are we gonna celebrate now?

09:07.341 --> 09:09.003
Isn't it a little
too early for that?

09:09.004 --> 09:10.608
Well, I'm not just celebrating.

09:10.740 --> 09:12.676
I'm also girding my loins. Oh?

09:13.016 --> 09:14.297
Or at least my liver.

09:14.695 --> 09:16.839
We haven't had a
walkerfest for so long.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.320
At least get me drunk.

09:19.698 --> 09:22.068
All right. I will celebrate.

09:24.005 --> 09:26.324
Here's to your $50-million deal.

09:26.461 --> 09:28.908
Actually, it's 55.

09:28.961 --> 09:30.016
Oh, sorry.

09:30.131 --> 09:32.131
But, you know, you never
stopped believing in that land,

09:32.517 --> 09:34.042
never, and for that,

09:34.456 --> 09:38.120
your entire family is gonna be
financially secure, so bravo.

09:38.456 --> 09:39.353
Thank you.

09:39.835 --> 09:42.811
That's enough about me.
Let's talk about my boyfriend.

09:43.437 --> 09:46.119
Here is to his seminaked self

09:46.120 --> 09:48.169
up there for the world to gawk at.

09:49.516 --> 09:50.683
You sorry I did it?

09:51.507 --> 09:53.524
Sorry? Why?

09:54.056 --> 09:55.864
Um... you can tell me.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.786
Honey, there is nothing
to be sorry about.

09:57.787 --> 10:01.611
I can assure you.
Tell me more about Paris.

10:01.624 --> 10:03.684
Well, there is this
apartment I know.

10:03.685 --> 10:04.864
It's in le marais.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.423
Le marais. And the windows,

10:06.424 --> 10:07.084
they give you a view into

10:07.113 --> 10:08.121
the place des vosges.
Oh, God. I've been there.

10:08.122 --> 10:10.250
Just lovely. Mmm.

10:10.385 --> 10:13.584
And below, there's the
best bakery in the world.

10:13.640 --> 10:17.775
We could live on
croissants and table wine.

10:17.776 --> 10:19.293
Oh, God. Let's go tonight.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.472
Uh, don't you want
to see your brother?

10:21.824 --> 10:23.991
Of course I do. God.

10:23.992 --> 10:25.880
You know, it's always a little...

10:26.663 --> 10:27.967
It's always a little tense

10:27.968 --> 10:29.744
when he comes back
from over there.

10:30.112 --> 10:30.880
I don't know.

10:31.568 --> 10:32.801
I feel like...

10:33.728 --> 10:36.272
The whole family's in limbo,
you know?

10:36.424 --> 10:39.337
Like we're on hold,
just waiting...

10:43.405 --> 10:44.812
Don't let that be me.

10:46.887 --> 10:47.890
Who?

10:47.891 --> 10:48.965
Robert,

10:49.573 --> 10:52.277
just... lying there like that.

10:53.168 --> 10:54.125
Mnh-mnh.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.176
Promise me that you
would end it. N-no.

10:59.177 --> 11:01.161
No, I am serious. Promise me.

11:01.729 --> 11:05.428
Sarah, I'm sorry. I love you.
I-I can't promise that.

11:18.792 --> 11:20.141
Oh, my gosh.

11:21.977 --> 11:22.507
Wow.

11:22.508 --> 11:24.288
It's Uncle Justin. Is that Evan?

11:24.289 --> 11:26.071
You know Uncle Justin.
I can't believe this.

11:26.072 --> 11:28.380
Hey. Hey, Evan.
Can you say hi? How are you?

11:28.520 --> 11:30.282
Oh, sweetie, it's okay.
You can say hi.

11:30.283 --> 11:32.123
Could I get a hug?
Wanna hug him? Yeah.

11:32.124 --> 11:35.615
Evan, oh, my God.
You're so big. Oh, my gosh.

11:35.616 --> 11:37.783
Yeah, well, that's what
happens when you feed 'em.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.615
You're so big. What have you
been eatin'? You gonna go play?

11:41.444 --> 11:43.493
Wow. Uh, he's huge.

11:46.709 --> 11:47.625
Oh, my God. Justin.

11:47.626 --> 11:50.116
Oh, come here. Come here.
Hey, come here. Come here.

11:50.117 --> 11:51.781
Oh, my God.

11:51.925 --> 11:53.299
I missed you so much.

11:53.717 --> 11:57.099
No, I'm... I'm, um, I am.
I'm... I'm fine.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.566
I just had to drop off, um, Evan,

11:59.567 --> 12:02.960
and I have a meeting at the...
At the R.N.C., actually.

12:03.861 --> 12:05.291
But... but how are you?

12:05.292 --> 12:07.239
I-I want to talk about you,
and I-I...

12:07.240 --> 12:08.662
how... h was it over there?

12:08.663 --> 12:10.906
I mean, well, not that
you could really say.

12:10.907 --> 12:13.772
Uh, no, I can. Um, I'm good.

12:14.884 --> 12:16.420
I'm good. It felt
different this time.

12:16.421 --> 12:18.741
Oh, good. Good.

12:19.188 --> 12:21.259
Kitty, you know, I-I think
about the accident a lot...

12:21.260 --> 12:22.813
I'm so happy you're back.

12:24.216 --> 12:26.725
Do you have any idea
how proud I am of you?

12:26.729 --> 12:27.817
I mean, look at you.

12:27.945 --> 12:29.911
Well, you haven't possibly
convinced my wife of that,

12:29.912 --> 12:30.937
have you? Oh.

12:33.380 --> 12:36.439
Have you... have you guys
been talking at least?

12:36.440 --> 12:38.232
Uh, some, some.

12:38.393 --> 12:40.952
You know, she sent me a
birthday present and stuff.

12:41.032 --> 12:43.432
You know, things were a
little strained when I left.

12:43.969 --> 12:46.145
Who am I kidding? They were-
they were practically broken.

12:47.584 --> 12:50.464
You know, she begged me
not to go, and I did,

12:50.789 --> 12:52.739
so she may not forgive me.

12:53.416 --> 12:55.368
And I have to prepare
myself for that.

12:58.593 --> 13:00.977
You kn, as hard as it is,
sometimes you...

13:01.393 --> 13:02.943
you just have to let someone go.

13:06.232 --> 13:07.771
Why are you saying that, Justin?

13:07.772 --> 13:09.977
As hard as it is, sometimes you
just have to let people go.

13:10.004 --> 13:12.579
Are you talking about Rebecca,
or are you talking about Robert?

13:12.580 --> 13:13.480
I was talking about Rebecca,

13:13.481 --> 13:15.667
but if you'd like to
talk about Robert... no,

13:15.717 --> 13:17.092
I-I don't want to.
You know what I want?

13:17.093 --> 13:19.991
I want to know why
everybody in this family

13:19.992 --> 13:22.037
thinks that it's just
so easy to play God.

13:22.038 --> 13:23.603
No, no, Kitty,
I'm not playing God.

13:23.604 --> 13:25.156
You know, there is... no, no.
There is a chance.

13:25.165 --> 13:26.707
There's a chance of recovery.

13:26.708 --> 13:28.067
Many, many cases, people

13:28.068 --> 13:29.689
have just emerged spont... okay,
not after a year

13:29.733 --> 13:31.883
and not with his kind of
catastrophic brain injury.

13:31.884 --> 13:32.967
It's not gonna happen.
Oh, really? How do you know, Justin?

13:32.968 --> 13:35.828
You're not a doctor.
There was a woman in 1968, okay?

13:35.829 --> 13:38.580
She was in a coma for 12 years-
he's never coming out of this.

13:41.497 --> 13:43.303
Then why is he fighting?

13:43.880 --> 13:45.896
He's not. You are.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.028
Wow.

13:50.621 --> 13:50.951
You know what?

13:50.952 --> 13:53.595
You just got off of an airplane.
You haven't been here in a year.

13:53.596 --> 13:56.318
You have no idea what
is going on here.

13:56.319 --> 13:57.856
You know what I thought?

13:58.272 --> 14:01.259
I actually thought that you
were gonna want to see him.

14:01.309 --> 14:03.868
So excuse me, please.
I'm sorry. Kitty, I'm s... no.

14:12.479 --> 14:13.552
You're kidding, right?

14:13.576 --> 14:14.084
I know.

14:14.085 --> 14:15.594
You can take it to the
living room if you want.

14:15.595 --> 14:17.814
Well, how? I don't
think I could lift it.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.121
I thought you were
working out twice a day.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.794
Uh, no, that would be Luc.

14:21.795 --> 14:23.999
I don't have time to
perfect my abs anymore.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.339
Anymore? Kevin, u never had abs.

14:26.340 --> 14:29.028
Uh, summer of '98.
Remember tae bo?

14:29.179 --> 14:30.573
Oh, sadly, I do.

14:30.972 --> 14:33.931
Can I at least show you
the pertinent parts?

14:33.932 --> 14:35.193
Luc's or the contracts?

14:35.194 --> 14:36.105
Kevin.

14:37.003 --> 14:38.260
When I was driving to court today,

14:38.265 --> 14:40.039
I saw him three times.

14:40.232 --> 14:42.664
I mean, how can you possibly
concentrate on anything else

14:42.665 --> 14:43.881
when you live with
an underwear model?

14:43.882 --> 14:45.492
He's an artist, actually...

14:45.493 --> 14:47.595
I agree. Who got badly affected

14:47.596 --> 14:49.352
by the global financial meltdown.

14:49.353 --> 14:51.631
He needed money. He has a
friend who's a photographer.

14:51.632 --> 14:53.511
This whole thing is
a complete fluke.

14:53.512 --> 14:54.600
Okay.

14:55.632 --> 14:57.372
Oh, okay. Clears throat

14:57.469 --> 15:00.876
"land herein referred
to as narrow lake..."

15:00.896 --> 15:01.307
Here we go.

15:01.308 --> 15:04.528
"Purchased for a sum
of $55 million."

15:04.720 --> 15:06.593
Whoa. That's a lot of money.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.379
One thing's for certain,

15:08.380 --> 15:09.911
tonight I can tell everybody

15:09.912 --> 15:12.292
that the deal's gonna
be signed and, you know,

15:12.293 --> 15:13.823
maybe when people find
out how much money

15:13.928 --> 15:16.060
they're gonna get... Sarah,
you don't have to give us money.

15:16.061 --> 15:18.252
I've told you that. No, I know.
I know, but I want to.

15:18.688 --> 15:20.809
Kitty's gonna need
it for Robert's care.

15:20.951 --> 15:22.092
You can keep practicing

15:22.093 --> 15:24.812
for the law firm of Walker,
pro, and Bono.

15:25.897 --> 15:28.547
And I can go to France. France?

15:28.548 --> 15:30.704
Luc and I have been
talking about the idea

15:30.724 --> 15:32.596
that we might all move to Paris.

15:33.222 --> 15:35.622
When you think about it,
what's really keeping me here?

15:38.288 --> 15:39.584
No, you're absolutely right.

15:39.892 --> 15:41.322
Kevin, that came out wrong.
I'm gonna go.

15:41.323 --> 15:43.165
No, no, I understand.
You should go to Paris.

15:43.739 --> 15:44.986
I wish Kitty'd go to Paris.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.502
I think we should all go to Paris.

15:46.503 --> 15:48.840
Does Justin know? No.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.464
Some homecoming, huh?

15:53.803 --> 15:54.699
Here.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.335
What is this for?

15:58.336 --> 15:59.159
The prosciutto.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.639
Yeah? This is for a softball game.

16:01.640 --> 16:02.764
Come on. Find a ripe one.

16:02.765 --> 16:05.964
Oh, for goodness sakes.
I can't concentrate.

16:06.537 --> 16:08.891
While we were still
in the airport,

16:08.892 --> 16:11.196
Justin was asking about Robert.

16:11.264 --> 16:13.583
For one year,
for one solid year...

16:13.584 --> 16:16.912
Yeah. Kitty hasn't been wanting
or willing to talk about it.

16:17.457 --> 16:19.651
And I-I can't tell her what to do.

16:19.824 --> 16:22.458
Well, I've noticed

16:22.459 --> 16:25.131
yeah, well, I lost my voice. Here.

16:26.633 --> 16:27.688
Oh, it's ripe.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.560
Who's that? It's nobody.

16:35.725 --> 16:37.343
Who was that?

16:37.344 --> 16:38.928
It's that guy, okay?

16:39.800 --> 16:42.483
You mean the guy you were playing
backgammon with... mm-hmm.

16:42.484 --> 16:46.365
Why didn't you answer it?
That's a no-brainer.

16:46.397 --> 16:49.533
I don't know. A-and we have
so much in common also.

16:50.024 --> 16:51.431
Is he positive, too?

16:52.046 --> 16:53.148
Why would you ask that?

16:53.932 --> 16:55.256
I don't know. I'm sorry.

16:55.257 --> 16:56.462
I meant we have a lot in common.

16:56.463 --> 16:58.636
We have music in common,
we have backgammon in common.

16:58.637 --> 17:01.809
I-I-I-I don't define
myself by being positive.

17:01.810 --> 17:03.189
It's not something that I look for

17:03.190 --> 17:05.204
or I'm not looking
for in a partner.

17:06.116 --> 17:09.199
I-I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.040
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to jump on you.

17:11.537 --> 17:14.352
Saul, life is short and fragile.

17:14.768 --> 17:17.755
If I've learned nothing else this year,
I've learned that.

17:18.269 --> 17:19.949
I thought you lost your voice.

17:20.911 --> 17:22.219
Not with you, I haven't.

17:25.627 --> 17:26.387
Hey.

17:26.387 --> 17:27.034
Hey.

17:27.035 --> 17:29.872
How are things here? Oh, wow.
Nice flowers.

17:29.873 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, Nora and Saul
must have set the table,

17:32.001 --> 17:33.808
kind of a stealth operation.

17:33.844 --> 17:34.907
What, you don't approve?

17:34.908 --> 17:36.684
No, no, it-it's beautiful.

17:37.712 --> 17:39.867
I just think it's weird that
your mother hasn't called today,

17:39.868 --> 17:42.172
you know, about the
menu or about anything.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.144
There's a lot of things
that are weird recently.

17:44.145 --> 17:45.136
It's nothing new.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.524
So my client got to go
home to his father today

17:48.525 --> 17:49.296
instead of juvie.

17:49.297 --> 17:50.823
Oh, that's... that's good, right?

17:50.824 --> 17:54.995
Mm. I guess so.
Kid didn't seem too pleased.

17:54.996 --> 17:56.787
It's funny. He asked m.

17:58.812 --> 17:59.787
What'd you say?

18:00.312 --> 18:01.800
Ah. I said no.

18:02.631 --> 18:05.081
Anyway, I got a lot of work
to do before dinner tonight.

18:05.221 --> 18:07.747
Do... do you want to...
Talk about it?

18:08.571 --> 18:09.484
About what?

18:10.200 --> 18:11.755
You know, you do this.
You bring it up,

18:11.756 --> 18:13.532
and then you just... what,
the surrogacy?

18:14.108 --> 18:15.741
Kevin, why else did you
tell me that story?

18:17.142 --> 18:19.037
Because it was something
that happened at work today.

18:19.038 --> 18:21.936
I don't believe you.
I think you're in a lot of pain

18:21.937 --> 18:23.924
about losing the baby,
and you want to talk about it...

18:23.925 --> 18:26.987
we had two, Scotty.
We had two miscarriages. Exactly.

18:27.166 --> 18:28.876
And the only way we're
gonna get through this

18:28.897 --> 18:32.560
is if we talk about it.
You have to let me do this my way, okay?

18:32.688 --> 18:34.384
I am trying to move on.
Why do you think I'm doing

18:34.393 --> 18:35.843
this kind of work?
I totally respect

18:35.844 --> 18:37.370
that you're practicing
law out of a restaurant,

18:37.371 --> 18:38.232
that you're helping people that

18:38.240 --> 18:39.466
need your help the most... yeah,
because right now,

18:39.467 --> 18:40.543
it's the only thing
that makes sense to me.

18:40.544 --> 18:42.008
Well, it's also a convenient way

18:42.009 --> 18:43.398
for you to forget
about what happened.

18:43.399 --> 18:45.048
I haven't forgotten
what's happened.

18:45.564 --> 18:47.698
I just have no desire to
dwell on it. That's all.

18:47.699 --> 18:50.071
Kevin, what happened was
a mistake of biology.

18:50.072 --> 18:51.773
I know you think you can
control everything...

18:51.774 --> 18:53.905
we couldn't even
control our surrogate.

18:54.088 --> 18:55.257
What's that supposed to mean?

18:55.790 --> 18:57.727
I don't blame Michelle for what
happened, but she certainly...

18:57.728 --> 19:01.364
no, I-I think you do,
and until you realize that,

19:01.365 --> 19:03.029
we're never gonna be
able to try again.

19:04.316 --> 19:07.097
Do you have any idea
what I've lost this year?

19:07.685 --> 19:09.924
Not just a baby.
Don't you understand?

19:10.480 --> 19:13.152
My best friend is on life support.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.488
I don't want to try again.

19:20.344 --> 19:22.297
Kitty, I'm glad you
could come in today.

19:22.561 --> 19:25.608
We have been putting together
names of possible people

19:25.609 --> 19:27.447
to take over the r.N.C.

19:27.448 --> 19:30.760
And, uh, you are
on the short list.

19:32.036 --> 19:33.652
Oh, my God. No.

19:34.020 --> 19:37.355
No, no, no. No, no, see,
that is simply out of the question.

19:37.356 --> 19:39.912
See, that would require me to
spend a lot of time on the road,

19:39.935 --> 19:43.362
and I can't afford to be away
from Robert for that long.

19:46.261 --> 19:47.572
Oh, look...

19:47.808 --> 19:51.286
Kitty, I-I... I'm... I'm sorry
for the mis-misunderstanding.

19:51.287 --> 19:52.331
I... it's okay. Um...

19:52.332 --> 19:55.421
we understand what you're
going through this year.

19:55.592 --> 19:56.472
Mm.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.648
We were just hoping.

20:01.031 --> 20:01.961
What?

20:03.993 --> 20:05.847
The republican national committee

20:05.848 --> 20:07.727
needs someone with-
with your intelligence,

20:07.728 --> 20:10.125
your... your clear-headed
thinking...

20:10.143 --> 20:12.422
And frankly, your compassion.

20:12.660 --> 20:16.890
Well, we just think you're-
you're too good to waste.

20:16.891 --> 20:17.663
Yeah.

20:23.060 --> 20:24.119
Well, thank you.

20:25.675 --> 20:27.583
Th-thank you. I'm, um...

20:28.269 --> 20:29.195
Why don't we do this?

20:29.196 --> 20:34.265
Why don't we call it a...
Possibility?

20:35.094 --> 20:37.427
So... you'll think about it?

20:37.428 --> 20:40.545
Yes. I'll, uh, I'll...

20:41.685 --> 20:42.355
I'll think about it.

20:42.356 --> 20:43.499
Oh, good. Ye.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.372
Great. Great. Good.

20:50.267 --> 20:51.178
Justin?

20:52.927 --> 20:53.787
Justin?

20:57.362 --> 20:59.256
Uh, Kitty told me you were here.

20:59.257 --> 21:00.733
I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

21:00.963 --> 21:02.313
Mom, where's Rebecca?

21:04.091 --> 21:04.792
Mom.

21:06.164 --> 21:07.896
She moved out a few weeks ago.

21:07.897 --> 21:09.014
What are you talking about?
You... you... you...

21:09.015 --> 21:10.315
you picked me up at the airport,

21:10.316 --> 21:12.701
d you didn't tell me? No,
I didn't tell you.

21:12.819 --> 21:15.371
So... so this is better,
for me to walk into my house

21:15.372 --> 21:17.857
and... and find my
wife's stuff gone, mom?

21:17.858 --> 21:19.945
I didn't want to get
into the middle of it.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.904
What are... what else did she say?

21:22.905 --> 21:24.583
Why do I have to be
the one to tell you?

21:24.584 --> 21:25.981
Why can't you... mom, please.

21:27.770 --> 21:29.813
You know, Justin. You know.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.685
She said it was the accident...

21:32.913 --> 21:34.772
You going off to war again.

21:35.881 --> 21:37.231
It was more than she could handle.

21:37.232 --> 21:38.392
That's what she said.

21:41.577 --> 21:42.392
I knew it.

21:42.393 --> 21:44.664
Yeah, I mean, uh...
I knew it was gonna be rough.

21:44.665 --> 21:46.313
I thought I was gonna
be sleeping on the couch

21:46.314 --> 21:47.727
or maybe at your house.

21:47.728 --> 21:48.545
I never...

21:54.678 --> 21:56.414
Justin, I'm sorry. I...

21:57.817 --> 22:00.716
I'm so sorry. I feel like
this is all my fault.

22:02.152 --> 22:03.837
If I hadn't yelled at you...

22:03.838 --> 22:06.292
And you hadn't gone back...

22:07.747 --> 22:08.973
Look, I've got...

22:09.514 --> 22:10.961
I've got a lot of
things I have to do,

22:10.962 --> 22:13.204
so, um, I'll see you tonight.

22:13.205 --> 22:15.200
We're... we're all meeting
at the restaurant...

22:15.606 --> 22:17.748
Scotty's and... and... and Saul's...
about 8:00,

22:17.749 --> 22:19.628
un-unless you think
that's too late.

22:19.629 --> 22:22.067
I don't care, mom.
Or we could do it at my house.

22:22.068 --> 22:23.166
We don't have to go
to the restaurant.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.042
Oh, mom, mom, it doesn't matter.
I don't care where we eat.

22:25.043 --> 22:27.608
I need you to leave.
I need to be alone. I'm serious. Go.

22:30.309 --> 22:31.000
Go, mom.

22:31.001 --> 22:31.797
Okay.

22:41.466 --> 22:44.544
I know it's boring,
but I made lasagna again.

22:44.545 --> 22:45.539
Holly loves it.

22:45.540 --> 22:46.961
Oh, so do I. Thank you.

22:46.962 --> 22:47.922
You're welcome.

22:48.794 --> 22:50.965
So how is she? You look tired.

22:51.241 --> 22:53.693
Um, well, it's been a rough week.

22:53.924 --> 22:56.640
Uh, I thought things
were getting better.

22:57.119 --> 22:58.870
Uh, yeah, so did I.

22:58.871 --> 23:00.517
You know, then, uh, she forgets,

23:00.518 --> 23:03.219
and it's like we're back to
right after the accident.

23:04.068 --> 23:06.282
David, I-I-I really
think you should know

23:06.283 --> 23:08.203
that Justin is back.

23:09.241 --> 23:10.122
Great.

23:10.666 --> 23:11.799
That's all we need.

23:11.800 --> 23:15.161
Look, I-I don't-
I don't want to get involved,

23:15.162 --> 23:17.092
but if you could...

23:17.571 --> 23:20.499
If you could get
Rebecca to call him...

23:20.500 --> 23:23.290
no, Nora, she doesn't
want to talk to him.

23:23.291 --> 23:24.336
I don't want to be
in the middle of it.

23:24.337 --> 23:25.520
Honestly, I don't. I...

23:25.521 --> 23:26.405
David?

23:28.753 --> 23:30.015
What are you doing here?

23:30.848 --> 23:33.001
Um, I brought you
some more lasagna,

23:33.002 --> 23:34.742
and David and I were talking.

23:35.098 --> 23:35.823
Why?

23:37.687 --> 23:39.070
What do you want with him?

23:40.265 --> 23:42.791
We're friends, holly.
We're all friends now.

23:43.818 --> 23:45.966
Does William know
that you're here?

23:47.210 --> 23:48.975
Oh, holly, William's dead.

23:48.976 --> 23:51.385
William... William died
a number of years ago.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.519
Nora just brought
us dinner tonight.

23:54.699 --> 23:56.790
I don't understand
what is going on here.

23:57.099 --> 23:59.598
You and Nora are good
friends now, holly.

23:59.599 --> 24:02.613
It... Justin, her son,
is married to Rebecca.

24:05.131 --> 24:07.342
Get that woman out of my house.

24:11.370 --> 24:12.673
Oh, David. Honestly, she's...

24:12.674 --> 24:14.460
she's going to remember
everything eventually.

24:14.461 --> 24:15.849
No, Nora, she won't.

24:15.891 --> 24:18.977
All she'll do is memorize
the things she forgot.

24:19.684 --> 24:20.887
I'll be right back.

24:21.555 --> 24:22.327
Okay.

24:26.075 --> 24:27.555
Go on. I mean, tell me.

24:27.556 --> 24:29.658
Did he seem distant or distracted?

24:29.659 --> 24:32.021
Was he going to see Rebecca?
That's what he said.

24:32.022 --> 24:34.811
But you guys think they'll
work it out, right? Yeah.

24:34.812 --> 24:37.191
Um, mom's not
upstairs either. Hey.

24:38.091 --> 24:40.097
Um, well, you know we have
half an hour on the chicken.

24:40.098 --> 24:41.330
Maybe she went to get some wine.

24:41.331 --> 24:43.700
I was fine doing it at
the restaurant, you know?

24:43.984 --> 24:46.521
Mom caught me a little upset,
and I think she freaked out.

24:46.522 --> 24:48.415
I'd offer you some wine,
but I can't find any.

24:48.416 --> 24:49.141
Really?

24:50.177 --> 24:53.218
And, uh, you don't drink wine,
obviously.

24:54.450 --> 24:55.157
Sorry.

24:56.127 --> 24:58.379
Is it weird, you know...

24:58.797 --> 24:59.942
Being back?

25:04.611 --> 25:06.247
All right, guys,
don't be weird. All right?

25:06.248 --> 25:08.280
I made it home with all my
fingers and all my toes,

25:08.281 --> 25:11.003
so just be normal, okay? Yeah.

25:11.004 --> 25:12.001
Be normal. Yeah.

25:12.002 --> 25:13.375
Yeah. Got it. Sure.

25:13.376 --> 25:17.886
- So I, uh, I heard you had a
meeying at the R.N.C. - I did.

25:18.106 --> 25:20.335
And did they offer you a job?

25:20.336 --> 25:22.535
Yes, they did.
Are you gonna take it?

25:22.536 --> 25:23.457
What? No, I'm not.

25:23.458 --> 25:26.882
But I would take some wine
if anybody can find any.

25:26.883 --> 25:29.311
I'm looking. This is very weird.

25:29.312 --> 25:31.839
Yeah. So, uh,
how's the restaurant?

25:31.840 --> 25:34.763
Oh. Oh, we've been open for six-
six months now?

25:34.764 --> 25:37.998
How's the food? It's amazing.
Absolutely incredible.

25:37.999 --> 25:39.718
She hasn't been since they opened.

25:39.719 --> 25:41.309
That is not true.

25:41.368 --> 25:43.807
I've been. Really?

25:43.808 --> 25:44.532
No.

25:45.678 --> 25:46.617
Oh.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.310
Uh, well, you kn,
I don't think Kitty's been either.

25:50.311 --> 25:52.959
No, I was there. Mom and I
went for lunch over the summer.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.796
Right, Scotty?
You came in for coffee once.

25:56.310 --> 25:57.175
Look, you know what?

25:57.176 --> 25:59.134
Everybody's been busy. So what?

25:59.135 --> 26:00.653
I just want to know,
where is the wine?

26:01.346 --> 26:04.097
Oh. Sorry.

26:04.098 --> 26:06.062
I was just out getting some...

26:06.858 --> 26:08.240
Anyway, they were out of it.

26:08.661 --> 26:10.465
So I'll do the salad. Oh.

26:10.466 --> 26:11.848
Where's the wine? We don't know.

26:11.849 --> 26:14.665
Nowhere to be found. Nora, the
table is set. And here's the wine.

26:14.666 --> 26:15.599
Eureka! Great.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.714
I thought for a horrible moment
that this house had run dry.

26:18.715 --> 26:20.559
God, no. I have set
the table twice,

26:20.560 --> 26:23.341
and if this party moves anyplace else,
you are on your own.

26:23.617 --> 26:26.210
Where's that Luc?
Probably taking his clothes off.

26:26.211 --> 26:27.964
Kevin, that is not funny.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.992
He will be here soon.
Something came up.

26:30.993 --> 26:32.796
Yeah, I bet it did. Kevin.

26:32.809 --> 26:34.497
You'll miss my jokes in France.

26:34.498 --> 26:35.239
France? Yeah.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.367
I told you not to say anything.
No, you didn't, actually.

26:37.368 --> 26:40.468
Well, I meant to. Wait a minute.
You're moving to France?

26:43.551 --> 26:46.037
France. Wow.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.966
That's great. There's
a lot to do in France.

26:48.967 --> 26:52.086
Great? Great? What,
are you kidding, mom? Great?

26:53.607 --> 26:56.489
Kitty, would you just slice
some of these olives for me?

26:56.490 --> 26:58.228
Sure. I'll slice olives.

26:58.673 --> 27:02.207
There you go. Okay, let's make a
toast to our Justin, the hero.

27:02.208 --> 27:03.265
Cheers. Welcome back,
little brother.

27:03.266 --> 27:06.058
Thank you, Uncle Saul.
How are you? I'm go. I'm good.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.394
Ask him where his
boyfriend is. What?

27:08.395 --> 27:11.001
You have a boyfriend? No,
I don't have a boyfriend.

27:11.002 --> 27:14.298
Exactly. You know what,
Nora? We are not in junior high school.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.337
So would you please can it?

27:15.338 --> 27:18.902
Um, I was gonna wait
until after dinner,

27:18.903 --> 27:20.246
but what the heck?

27:20.538 --> 27:22.904
We're gonna be closing
the narrow lake deal

27:22.905 --> 27:26.091
with tevia beverages in a few days.
Yep, she's not kidding.

27:26.092 --> 27:27.866
I've seen the contracts.
It's a great deal. It's a great deal.

27:27.867 --> 27:30.625
Wait a second. So... so that's
what you're gonna do

27:30.626 --> 27:31.895
with narrow lake is sell it?

27:31.906 --> 27:34.030
I thought you were
gonna save the family.

27:34.420 --> 27:37.041
Well, uh, Justin,
you've been gone.

27:37.042 --> 27:38.217
It's been a long year.

27:38.218 --> 27:41.543
And the money will be
really helpful to everyone.

27:42.940 --> 27:44.183
Okay. Um...

27:44.940 --> 27:46.192
So, uh, what are you
gonna do with the money?

27:46.193 --> 27:47.988
Are you guys gonna try
and get pregnant again?

27:48.078 --> 27:49.816
Who, us? No. That ship has sailed.

27:49.817 --> 27:52.733
Ship? I'm sorry. I thought that was...
that was your dream.

27:52.945 --> 27:54.360
Yeah, I'm confused, too, Kevin.

27:54.361 --> 27:58.038
Oh... not now. Please.

27:58.353 --> 28:00.716
Okay. Uh, Kitty,
what are you gonna do with it?

28:01.623 --> 28:03.291
What am I gonna do with the money?

28:03.479 --> 28:04.613
Well, I-I think

28:04.614 --> 28:07.241
it's obvious what I'm
gonna do with the money.

28:09.165 --> 28:10.866
Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm really confused here.

28:10.867 --> 28:12.720
How is this money
helping everyone?

28:12.721 --> 28:13.861
Listen, Justin,

28:14.193 --> 28:16.613
we have all gotten
through this last year

28:17.122 --> 28:18.342
in our own way.

28:18.381 --> 28:21.888
Now I'm not saying that
what you did wasn't heroic,

28:21.938 --> 28:24.889
but you can't come back
here and judge us...

28:24.890 --> 28:27.521
no, no, no, no.
No one's judging anyone.

28:27.522 --> 28:29.162
Well, that isn't true,
is it, Justin?

28:29.163 --> 28:31.242
Look, I'm just
trying to help here.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.041
I mean, I-I feel like
after the accident,

28:33.042 --> 28:33.952
you guys all went to your room

28:33.953 --> 28:37.027
and shut the door and gave up.
Well, I'm sorry if you fee

28:37.028 --> 28:39.316
that me helping my
brothers and sister

28:39.317 --> 28:41.157
move with... Sarah,
you're not helping anyone.

28:41.473 --> 28:43.400
I mean, it sounds like you're
trying to buy everyone off

28:43.401 --> 28:45.111
so you can go to France
and forget any of this

28:45.112 --> 28:47.428
ever happened.
You just got back from hell,

28:47.429 --> 28:48.410
so I'm gonna let that go.

28:48.411 --> 28:50.792
No! No, don't let it go.
That's my whole point.

28:50.793 --> 28:52.542
No one is talking to each other.

28:52.936 --> 28:54.804
Mom, how are you
letting this happen?

28:55.399 --> 28:57.440
What... what would
you want me to do?

28:57.444 --> 28:59.154
Be the mother you
were when I left.

28:59.565 --> 29:01.019
You know, I w... I was right.

29:01.020 --> 29:03.787
We should've done this at
the restaurant. Maybe then...

29:03.788 --> 29:05.691
what... what, we'd behave ourselves?

29:05.692 --> 29:07.069
No, that's the last
thing we need to do.

29:07.070 --> 29:09.215
We need to be in
each other's faces.

29:09.216 --> 29:10.663
We need to be invested
in each other.

29:10.664 --> 29:13.660
We need to be walkers.
You know, k-Kevin doesn't want a baby,

29:13.696 --> 29:15.439
Sarah's moving to France,

29:15.440 --> 29:17.826
and... and Kitty, you know,
forget it, and Saul...

29:17.827 --> 29:20.406
forget it? Forget it? What do you mean,
"forget it"? What?

29:20.649 --> 29:23.827
What? All I'm trying to do is
take care of my husband, Justin,

29:23.828 --> 29:26.784
which is more than you ever did.
Kitty, Kitty, don't do this.

29:26.785 --> 29:28.969
What? What do you mean, "Kitty"?

29:28.970 --> 29:30.887
Mom, this is what he does.
This is what he does.

29:30.888 --> 29:32.993
He runs away. He r...

29:33.513 --> 29:35.544
no, no, Kitty. It's okay.
You can say it.

29:35.545 --> 29:36.821
Okay, I will say it.

29:37.265 --> 29:39.955
You... you left him.

29:40.168 --> 29:41.427
He was sitting in that car,

29:41.428 --> 29:42.790
he was bleeding, he needed you.

29:42.791 --> 29:46.525
He needed help, and you-
you just... you just left.

29:48.649 --> 29:50.493
I left him because I needed to,

29:50.921 --> 29:53.642
because holly needed me and
because your husband and I knew

29:53.643 --> 29:55.350
it was the right thing to do.

29:56.090 --> 29:57.607
He told me that night to leave.

29:57.608 --> 30:00.120
He said, "go, Justin.
I can wait for the ambulance."

30:00.121 --> 30:02.290
He said that because he knew
he wasn't gonna make it,

30:02.291 --> 30:03.477
and so did I.

30:04.042 --> 30:06.885
We were two soldiers who
made a choice that night.

30:07.192 --> 30:09.216
And that's what I
figured out over there,

30:09.217 --> 30:11.983
and I think that's why I
went back, to remember.

30:12.873 --> 30:13.959
Well, I'm, um...

30:14.833 --> 30:16.175
I'm very, very happy for you.

30:16.176 --> 30:19.521
I'm very happy that your year
was so productive, Justin.

30:19.522 --> 30:23.133
But see, things haven't
been quite so clear for me.

30:23.337 --> 30:27.637
Okay, see, you don't understand
what you're asking me to do.

30:27.953 --> 30:30.054
I mean, what if... what if it were?

30:30.055 --> 30:31.514
What if it were Paige?
What if it were Cooper?

30:31.515 --> 30:32.752
What if it were Scotty?

30:34.139 --> 30:36.222
I mean, you are basically
asking me to kill him.

30:36.223 --> 30:37.987
And you know what? By the way,
he's not a soldier.

30:37.988 --> 30:40.176
He's just... he's just my husband.

30:41.101 --> 30:42.216
And, um...

30:43.572 --> 30:46.612
This is not a-a war story, Justin.

30:46.613 --> 30:47.921
This is just my life.

30:48.085 --> 30:49.723
So, um, mom, I'm very sorry,

30:49.724 --> 30:52.239
but, um, I'm not gonna
stay for dinner, okay?

31:10.977 --> 31:11.773
You hungry?

31:12.297 --> 31:13.670
No, thank you.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.249
Sorry it didn't go well.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.380
I was just about to
leave when you called.

31:17.512 --> 31:20.517
Yeah. Oh, God.
He's right, you know?

31:20.881 --> 31:21.464
Who's right?

31:21.465 --> 31:24.024
Justin. We were gonna
take the money and run,

31:24.030 --> 31:25.435
all the way to France.

31:25.654 --> 31:27.551
A little break from them
could be a good thing.

31:27.552 --> 31:30.462
Well, according to Justin,
I already took a break.

31:30.463 --> 31:34.539
We all did. You know what? Wait.
We don't have to move to France.

31:34.862 --> 31:36.794
I grew up there.
There's nothing new to me.

31:37.716 --> 31:39.353
It's not gonna fix what's
wrong with your family.

31:39.354 --> 31:40.127
I know.

31:41.155 --> 31:43.919
Luc, what if this whole
deal is a huge mistake?

31:43.971 --> 31:47.247
Your deal? That's crazy.
Is it? I mean, think about it.

31:47.248 --> 31:49.257
Maybe Justin's right.
If... if we sell the land,

31:49.258 --> 31:51.506
there is nothing holding
this family together.

31:51.507 --> 31:54.032
No one walks away
from $55 million.

31:54.033 --> 31:56.575
Yeah. No, you're right.

31:57.507 --> 31:59.841
Okay, what... what if I
go ahead with the deal,

31:59.842 --> 32:02.177
I sell the land,
I take all of the money,

32:02.178 --> 32:04.297
we put it in some
kind of family trust.

32:04.298 --> 32:05.137
I don't touch it.

32:05.138 --> 32:07.770
Okay, so that... that means,
uh, we're not rich anymore?

32:07.771 --> 32:09.615
Yes. Okay.

32:11.084 --> 32:11.876
But I promise,

32:11.877 --> 32:14.096
it'll be a better year
than one we just had.

32:14.508 --> 32:16.388
And who knows?
Maybe you can extend

32:16.389 --> 32:18.986
your 15 minutes of half-naked fame

32:18.987 --> 32:20.104
into half an hour.

32:20.892 --> 32:22.283
Well, you know,
look on the bright side.

32:22.284 --> 32:23.442
At least Justin seems all right.

32:23.443 --> 32:25.920
I know. Maybe I've been in a
habit of underestimating him,

32:25.921 --> 32:28.929
but I was convinced he was
gonna come home with p.T.S.D.

32:29.196 --> 32:31.739
No, seriously. Now I'm
more worried about Kitty.

32:31.740 --> 32:32.647
Yeah.

32:33.293 --> 32:34.369
Oh, no.

32:36.869 --> 32:38.379
Is that a kid under the blanket?

32:38.380 --> 32:40.207
That's not just a kid.
That's... that's my client.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.049
That's a former client.
That's Mateo.

32:42.533 --> 32:43.931
Oh. What... what's he doing here?

32:43.932 --> 32:45.444
I don't know. He's supposed
to be at his father's.

32:45.445 --> 32:46.929
This is not a good sign.

32:48.319 --> 32:51.226
Well, we can't just Lee him here.
Whoa. Wh... yes, we can.

32:51.227 --> 32:54.194
I can't take in every
client like a stray puppy.

32:54.195 --> 32:55.397
This place would be like a kennel.

32:55.398 --> 32:57.444
Well, Kevin, maybe you're
worried about the wrong person

32:57.445 --> 32:59.128
getting post-traumatic
stress disorder, Bec...

32:59.129 --> 33:01.399
don't start down that road with me.
I'm... no, you keeping saying

33:01.400 --> 33:03.175
I don't know how much
you've lost this year. I do.

33:03.176 --> 33:04.888
But I also know you're
not handling it well.

33:04.889 --> 33:07.128
He's a perfect example.
You're off the clock now,

33:07.129 --> 33:07.619
and look what you're doing.

33:07.620 --> 33:09.210
You're willing to let some
boy sleep on the street

33:09.211 --> 33:11.274
who clearly needs your help.
I mean, come on, Kevin...

33:11.275 --> 33:15.712
hey, would you shut up?
What are you doing here? What's going on?

33:15.908 --> 33:18.017
I'm trying to sleep.
The damn garbage trucks

33:18.018 --> 33:20.833
make less noise than you two.
Why aren't you at your father's?

33:20.834 --> 33:23.128
Because it sucks there.
I tried to tell you,

33:23.129 --> 33:25.509
but he was standing
right next to us.

33:26.385 --> 33:27.860
He's drunk now anyway.

33:29.131 --> 33:30.472
It's your call, Kevin.

33:38.699 --> 33:39.533
Come on.

33:39.659 --> 33:41.060
Can I take a shower, too? Bec...

33:41.061 --> 33:42.299
One night.

33:42.492 --> 33:43.984
And don't touch a thing.

33:55.912 --> 33:57.003
Don't say it.

33:58.031 --> 34:00.401
Don't say "I knew you'd be here."

34:00.402 --> 34:03.064
It's too predictable, like me.

34:03.065 --> 34:05.678
Well, you are anything
but predictable.

34:08.007 --> 34:10.387
Well, I'm doing
what I always do...

34:11.551 --> 34:14.763
Digging in my heels
and not letting go.

34:16.543 --> 34:18.666
It's a lot to let go of.

34:22.222 --> 34:24.266
I can't even go in there tonight.

34:28.159 --> 34:29.976
Do you know that every
time I go in there,

34:29.976 --> 34:31.545
it always shocks me...

34:33.600 --> 34:35.524
How much he looks like Robert?

34:37.858 --> 34:39.420
But it isn't him, is it?

34:41.929 --> 34:42.949
No.

34:44.681 --> 34:45.469
No.

34:47.184 --> 34:47.973
No.

34:51.353 --> 34:52.540
Kitty, I'm sorry.

34:55.513 --> 34:57.773
I know what it's like
to lose a husband.

34:58.103 --> 34:59.100
I know.

35:02.008 --> 35:03.275
I-I just...

35:03.869 --> 35:06.113
I just feel so backed
up against the wall.

35:07.413 --> 35:08.229
Lashing...

35:08.682 --> 35:10.566
Out at Justin like that?

35:12.977 --> 35:14.886
I don't want to be
this person anymore.

35:16.353 --> 35:17.573
Oh, sweetheart.

35:18.652 --> 35:20.563
I know that he's never
gonna get better.

35:20.564 --> 35:22.153
I know that he's gone.

35:23.171 --> 35:25.674
And I have wanted to say
good-bye for so long,

35:25.675 --> 35:26.825
but I just...

35:27.909 --> 35:29.106
Just can't do it.

35:30.755 --> 35:31.576
Why?

35:36.590 --> 35:38.104
Because I don't know what to do...

35:39.557 --> 35:40.505
Without him.

35:41.883 --> 35:45.124
It's not Robert that I'm
afraid of losing anymore.

35:45.125 --> 35:46.642
I-I think it's me.

35:51.133 --> 35:52.952
You'll find yourself again.

35:55.638 --> 35:57.481
I always get to this point...

35:59.396 --> 36:01.682
And then I just can't say it.

36:02.505 --> 36:03.550
What?

36:05.433 --> 36:06.398
Good-bye.

36:11.650 --> 36:13.119
Good-bye, Robert.

36:20.827 --> 36:22.570
"It was always right
around the moon.

36:22.571 --> 36:24.054
"And then Harold made his bed.

36:24.234 --> 36:26.270
"He got in it and
Drew up the covers.

36:27.347 --> 36:28.994
"The purple crayon
dropped on the floor,

36:28.995 --> 36:30.639
and Harold Dropp off to sleep."

36:32.599 --> 36:35.147
Oh, isn't that such a good story?

36:35.148 --> 36:37.614
Yes! Guess what, buddy.
I hate to tell you this,

36:37.615 --> 36:39.895
but it's time for
you to go to bed.

36:40.139 --> 36:42.282
Bedtime. Yeah. Come on, sweetie.

36:42.283 --> 36:43.729
No, I don't want to go to bed.

36:43.730 --> 36:45.608
I know you don't want to
go to bed... I don't want...

36:45.609 --> 36:48.762
but you have to say good-night
to Uncle Justin. Thanks...

36:48.763 --> 36:50.910
good night, Uncle Justin.
A high five.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.425
Aw. Yeah. Thanks, champ.

36:52.890 --> 36:53.826
Come on, baby. You know what?

36:53.827 --> 36:55.493
Grandma's gonna be
meeting you upstairs,

36:55.494 --> 36:57.518
and I'm gonna be up
in one minute, okay?

36:59.625 --> 37:01.936
Oh, well, thank you, Uncle Justin.

37:02.002 --> 37:03.636
It was a beautiful service.

37:03.802 --> 37:06.903
Yeah, it... it, uh... it was.

37:07.530 --> 37:09.173
There was a lot of great
tributes to Robert.

37:09.174 --> 37:12.702
Yeah. Even from some democrats.

37:15.322 --> 37:18.619
Oh, you know, Robert
would've loved your eulogy...

37:19.266 --> 37:20.678
the serenity prayer.

37:21.842 --> 37:23.377
"God, grant me the serenity

37:23.378 --> 37:26.086
to accept the things
I cannot change"...

37:26.459 --> 37:28.470
"And the courage to change
the things I can"...

37:29.122 --> 37:31.373
"And the wisdom to
know the difference."

37:34.372 --> 37:35.389
Justin, I'm...

37:37.763 --> 37:38.841
I'm sorry.

37:38.842 --> 37:40.999
No, you did everything you
could've done that night,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.694
and I'm so sorry.
I-I ambushed you.

37:43.898 --> 37:45.274
You know, I-I came on too strong.

37:45.275 --> 37:47.246
No. Obviously, I needed it.

37:49.192 --> 37:51.313
I never would've believed it,
but it's true.

37:51.314 --> 37:52.612
My baby brother came home,

37:52.613 --> 37:54.064
and he knew that I was in trouble,

37:54.065 --> 37:57.518
and he had the courage to tell me.

37:57.985 --> 37:58.975
So thank you.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.567
Do you know who you remind me of

38:05.847 --> 38:07.340
these last couple of days?

38:08.272 --> 38:09.099
Who?

38:09.920 --> 38:10.788
Robert.

38:13.719 --> 38:16.125
Uh, okay, guys. I think
dinner's just about ready,

38:16.126 --> 38:18.524
and your son is waiting
for you upstairs.

38:18.525 --> 38:20.088
He wants a kiss from mommy.

38:20.089 --> 38:22.459
Okay, I'm going.
I'm going. I'll see you.

38:24.278 --> 38:25.671
Come on, Justin. Let's eat.

38:25.672 --> 38:27.587
Wait. Mom, wait. Come here.

38:28.999 --> 38:29.905
I need to tell you something,

38:29.906 --> 38:31.027
and I need you to listen to me.

38:32.527 --> 38:33.379
Okay.

38:35.335 --> 38:36.204
Thank you.

38:37.576 --> 38:38.547
For what?

38:38.832 --> 38:42.405
For pushing me, for getting
me out of my miserable self

38:42.406 --> 38:43.688
and forcing me to go off to war,

38:43.689 --> 38:46.243
and I got to do what I needed
to do this whole last year.

38:46.931 --> 38:48.203
You did that, mom.

38:50.111 --> 38:51.060
Do you hear me?

38:54.279 --> 38:54.683
Mom.

38:54.684 --> 38:55.801
Yes.

38:58.686 --> 38:59.834
Then come home.

39:01.253 --> 39:02.786
I did, but you didn't.

39:04.013 --> 39:05.465
We need our mother again.

39:06.573 --> 39:09.139
We need the most overbearing,

39:09.501 --> 39:14.198
in-your-face, nosy,
hovering, little...

39:14.199 --> 39:15.302
I beg your pardon.

39:15.303 --> 39:16.330
In other words,

39:17.421 --> 39:18.378
look at me...

39:19.980 --> 39:21.993
The greatest mother
in the entire world.

39:23.461 --> 39:24.473
We need you.

39:25.045 --> 39:26.049
Come home.

39:41.286 --> 39:43.577
At the airport,
you asked me if you'd grown.

39:46.306 --> 39:47.374
You have.

39:50.602 --> 39:51.426
Want to eat?

39:51.427 --> 39:52.223
Yes.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.578
Scotty, the food is insanely good.

40:02.579 --> 40:05.857
And here we all are around the
old dining room table again.

40:06.036 --> 40:07.640
Robert would've loved this.

40:08.819 --> 40:09.551
Okay, come on.

40:09.552 --> 40:13.021
That is ridiculous.
Robert would've hated this.

40:13.793 --> 40:14.232
Yeah.

40:14.233 --> 40:16.283
But he would've looked
very good hating it.

40:16.284 --> 40:18.767
That's true. And no one
would've known he was hating it.

40:18.768 --> 40:20.965
He was a politician.
He lied for a living. And so well.

40:20.966 --> 40:23.933
All right. Enough. Let's have a toast.
Come on. To Robert.

40:23.934 --> 40:25.237
Come on. To Robert.

40:25.238 --> 40:26.939
To Robert.

40:27.017 --> 40:30.070
* When I'm not sure of *

40:30.071 --> 40:32.845
* My priorities *

40:32.846 --> 40:35.598
* When I've lost sight of *

40:35.599 --> 40:38.302
* Of where I'm meant to be *

40:38.303 --> 40:41.240
* Like holy water *

40:41.600 --> 40:43.839
* Washing over me *

40:45.076 --> 40:50.110
* You make it real for me *

40:50.122 --> 40:53.919
* And I'm *

40:53.920 --> 40:56.381
* Running to you, baby *

40:57.266 --> 40:58.626
Well, like I said,

40:58.627 --> 41:00.990
it took a long time
to get back here.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.009
I did the right thing.
I know that now.

41:05.901 --> 41:08.384
I would've done it sooner if
you'd been there to help me,

41:08.732 --> 41:09.984
but you weren't.

41:11.619 --> 41:12.497
But I...

41:14.413 --> 41:16.345
I have this feeling that...

41:16.837 --> 41:18.627
* Running to you, baby *

41:18.628 --> 41:19.773
I'm gonna be okay.

41:19.774 --> 41:22.762
* 'Cause you *

41:22.763 --> 41:24.693
I think we're gonna be okay.

41:24.961 --> 41:28.096
* That's why *

41:28.097 --> 41:30.783
* I've been missing you lately *

41:30.784 --> 41:35.284
* 'Cause you make it real for me *

41:36.335 --> 41:42.230
* You make it real for me *
