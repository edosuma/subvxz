00:04.518 --> 00:06.393
- Caroline is...
- Possessed.

00:06.394 --> 00:08.173
Her possession is not a delusion.

00:08.173 --> 00:10.909
That's not holy water. I switched it.

00:10.910 --> 00:12.535
That was not your place, Kristen.

00:12.536 --> 00:14.861
If you want to experiment,
you talk to me.

00:14.862 --> 00:16.227
You don't just do it.

00:16.228 --> 00:17.386
I'm Sheryl.

00:17.387 --> 00:19.813
Leland. I'm gonna leave now,

00:19.814 --> 00:21.715
but I'll wait outside around the corner.

00:23.627 --> 00:25.061
Ketamine and caps.

00:26.830 --> 00:29.131
Where are you, God?

00:42.446 --> 00:44.614
Okay, what's going on?

00:44.615 --> 00:46.983
What do you mean?

00:46.984 --> 00:49.552
You two, the silence.

00:49.553 --> 00:51.654
We have nothing to say.

00:55.759 --> 00:57.693
A prophet?

00:57.694 --> 00:58.728
Yep.

00:58.729 --> 01:00.563
Have you ever done one of those?

01:00.564 --> 01:01.731
Nope.

01:03.934 --> 01:08.804
So, we find out if she's
real or not, is that it?

01:08.805 --> 01:10.306
Yep.

01:13.210 --> 01:14.377
Well...

01:14.378 --> 01:17.013
you two are a barrel
of fun this morning.

01:33.497 --> 01:34.521
Hey.

01:34.522 --> 01:38.067
_

01:38.068 --> 01:39.969
- You from the Church?
- _

01:39.970 --> 01:41.771
- Yes.
- Please, come in.

01:48.512 --> 01:49.712
It's playtime.

01:49.713 --> 01:51.881
It'll be like this for
the next ten minutes.

01:58.422 --> 02:00.623
Your home is in danger.

02:00.624 --> 02:02.625
Leave before it falls into darkness.

02:05.729 --> 02:07.930
What does that mean?

02:11.802 --> 02:12.835
Grace.

02:15.839 --> 02:18.207
Hello. I'm Grace.

02:18.208 --> 02:19.909
Would you like to sit?

02:19.910 --> 02:21.010
- Sure.
- Thank you.

02:21.011 --> 02:22.878
I'm-I'm David, and this is, uh,

02:22.879 --> 02:24.046
Kristen and Ben.

02:24.047 --> 02:25.548
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

02:25.549 --> 02:26.949
Would you like me to call nap time?

02:26.950 --> 02:28.617
Uh, no, it's fine.

02:29.301 --> 02:30.720
So...

02:30.721 --> 02:33.089
you want to know if God speaks to me?

02:34.591 --> 02:35.858
Yes.

02:35.859 --> 02:37.159
He does.

02:39.196 --> 02:41.197
How does God speak to you?

02:42.232 --> 02:44.467
Very slowly.

02:45.535 --> 02:46.869
You can hear him?

02:46.870 --> 02:48.237
Yes.

02:48.238 --> 02:49.572
And what does he sound like?

02:49.573 --> 02:51.407
A whisper, very quiet.

02:51.408 --> 02:52.641
Do you see him?

02:52.642 --> 02:54.477
No.

02:55.512 --> 02:57.279
Can you hear him now?

02:58.982 --> 03:00.583
No.

03:00.584 --> 03:02.084
Why is that?

03:02.085 --> 03:03.919
He has nothing to say.

03:07.691 --> 03:10.326
Do you wait for him to
have something to say?

03:10.327 --> 03:11.961
Sometimes.

03:11.962 --> 03:14.730
And sometimes I ask him a question.

03:16.299 --> 03:19.001
- Can you ask him a question now?
- Yes.

03:23.607 --> 03:25.741
Did you have a question?

03:27.244 --> 03:29.311
Was Jeffrey Epstein a suicide?

03:29.312 --> 03:30.713
- Ben.
- What?

03:30.714 --> 03:32.515
No.

03:34.084 --> 03:36.318
How was he killed?

03:37.554 --> 03:39.722
With a pillow.

03:39.723 --> 03:41.724
Why was he killed?

03:41.725 --> 03:44.894
Because he could hurt
several powerful men.

03:46.263 --> 03:49.131
It seems like an odd way
to deal out prophecies,

03:49.132 --> 03:51.167
to just give them to whoever asks.

03:52.202 --> 03:54.437
As opposed to... ?

03:56.706 --> 03:58.374
So you can...

03:58.375 --> 04:00.576
tell me what God wants of me?

04:00.577 --> 04:02.778
Yes.

04:02.779 --> 04:04.980
What does God want of me?

04:28.505 --> 04:30.306
You're in danger.

04:30.307 --> 04:33.242
In what way?

04:33.243 --> 04:36.479
They know about your visions,
and they want to stop you.

04:39.416 --> 04:42.751
You need to avoid the color
red for the next seven days.

04:44.788 --> 04:48.357
It sounds more like a...
a fortune cookie than God.

04:48.358 --> 04:51.327
Sometimes God sounds
like a fortune cookie.

04:51.328 --> 04:53.629
Why'd you blow that up?

04:53.630 --> 04:57.026
Sometimes when God's
voice gets too quiet,

04:57.027 --> 04:59.034
it helps me hear him.

05:12.115 --> 05:14.049
So?

05:15.085 --> 05:17.553
She certainly appears sincere.

05:17.554 --> 05:19.555
Is that enough?

05:19.556 --> 05:20.856
No.

05:20.857 --> 05:23.959
Does she claim to prophesy
in the name of Jesus?

05:23.960 --> 05:25.094
Yes.

05:25.095 --> 05:26.695
And?

05:26.696 --> 05:28.964
Well, I can claim to
prophesy in the name of Jesus.

05:28.965 --> 05:30.466
The question is: Am I right?

05:30.467 --> 05:31.867
Is she right?

05:31.868 --> 05:33.435
First, may I ask,

05:33.436 --> 05:35.437
why are we being handed this?

05:35.438 --> 05:37.206
Because it's your job.

05:37.207 --> 05:38.641
No.

05:38.642 --> 05:41.143
Millions of people claim
to speak in God's name.

05:41.144 --> 05:43.646
If you gave us every one,
we'd be chasing for decades.

05:43.647 --> 05:44.780
Why this one?

05:46.209 --> 05:48.034
We want to know if she's right.

05:48.035 --> 05:50.019
- Has she been right before?
- Yes.

05:50.020 --> 05:52.888
- With what?
- I can't answer that.

05:52.889 --> 05:55.991
Check her prophecies. Then we'll talk.

05:59.663 --> 06:02.097
- What was that about?
- Yeah.

06:02.098 --> 06:03.499
No idea.

06:03.500 --> 06:06.335
But there was a scribe there
taking down her prophecies.

06:06.336 --> 06:08.637
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's check her prophecies with the facts.

06:08.638 --> 06:10.239
Yep. Yep.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.508
Hey, Kristen, you got a second?

06:15.045 --> 06:16.412
We disagree.

06:16.413 --> 06:18.247
About this prophecy?

06:18.248 --> 06:21.350
About last night. The exorcism.

06:21.351 --> 06:23.619
But it should be a strength,
not a weakness.

06:23.620 --> 06:25.293
Oh, I thought it was.

06:25.294 --> 06:27.890
It was until you didn't trust
me and poured out the holy water.

06:27.891 --> 06:29.091
It was the only way to tell.

06:29.092 --> 06:30.960
No, it wasn't, but even if it was,

06:30.961 --> 06:32.361
trust me enough to tell me.

06:32.362 --> 06:34.897
And if I had told you, would
you have told the exorcist?

06:34.898 --> 06:36.765
- Yes.
- Which would negate the whole experiment.

06:36.766 --> 06:38.534
It wasn't the place for an experiment.

06:38.535 --> 06:39.926
Oh, every place is the
place for an experiment.

06:39.927 --> 06:41.852
It's the only way not to
let opinion impact results.

06:41.853 --> 06:43.606
Then trust me enough
to argue that with me,

06:43.607 --> 06:45.674
and we'll discuss.

06:45.675 --> 06:47.910
Do you have any idea how weird it is

06:47.911 --> 06:49.478
for me to be involved in this?

06:49.479 --> 06:51.614
I mean, I go to Whole
Foods during the day,

06:51.615 --> 06:53.115
and at night I say things like,

06:53.116 --> 06:54.717
"Would you have told the exorcist?"

06:54.718 --> 06:58.053
It's like I've taken a left
turn into the Middle Ages.

07:00.890 --> 07:02.625
Okay.

07:02.626 --> 07:05.304
See you tomorrow.

07:05.305 --> 07:07.697
No, it wasn't, but even if it was,

07:07.698 --> 07:09.232
trust me enough to tell me.

07:09.233 --> 07:11.868
And if I had told you, would
you have told the exorcist?

07:11.869 --> 07:13.694
- Yes.
- Which would negate the whole experiment.

07:13.695 --> 07:15.086
It wasn't the place for an experiment.

07:15.087 --> 07:17.946
Oh, every place is the
place for an experiment.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.779
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

07:29.806 --> 07:31.197
This is wrong.

07:31.198 --> 07:32.999
No, it's not.

07:41.531 --> 07:43.666
No, it's not right.

07:43.667 --> 07:45.067
Why not?

07:45.068 --> 07:47.470
Come on, baby, kiss me again.

07:47.471 --> 07:49.739
I want you so bad.

07:57.724 --> 07:59.748
_

08:01.141 --> 08:02.332
Who are you calling?

08:02.333 --> 08:03.590
Kristen.

08:03.591 --> 08:06.384
I had a scare with my
granddaughters the other night.

08:06.385 --> 08:09.492
Oh. Let's go. This is my song.

08:09.493 --> 08:11.327
It's always your song.

08:12.496 --> 08:14.597
So, what am I typing in?

08:14.598 --> 08:16.399
"Local sinkhole".

08:16.400 --> 08:18.901
Local sinkhole.

08:21.872 --> 08:24.507
A 30-foot sinkhole
opened in Queens overnight.

08:24.508 --> 08:27.043
As the grounds settled
from a recent rainstorm,

08:27.044 --> 08:29.136
the dirt lot disappeared
into the ground.

08:29.137 --> 08:30.567
But many lives were spared

08:30.568 --> 08:31.714
- because of one woman.
- I don't understand.

08:31.715 --> 08:33.515
- I was warned.
- What does this... ?

08:33.517 --> 08:34.984
That's why I moved out.

08:34.985 --> 08:37.053
And I warned my neighbor, too.

08:37.054 --> 08:40.423
Wait, is that her, the-the
lady from the day care?

08:40.424 --> 08:42.525
- Yes.
- What was the prophecy?

08:42.525 --> 08:45.061
"Leave your home.

08:45.062 --> 08:47.897
It's in danger of falling
into the darkness".

08:49.166 --> 08:51.167
I need to talk to her again.

08:51.168 --> 08:52.902
Yes.

08:52.903 --> 08:55.438
We both do.

09:07.699 --> 09:09.629
Wait.

09:09.630 --> 09:12.557
- She predicted the sinkhole.
- No, she anticipated it.

09:12.558 --> 09:13.925
- That is semantic.
- No, it's not.

09:13.926 --> 09:16.030
- It's scientific analysis.
- Wait a minute, Ben.

09:16.031 --> 09:17.269
What do you mean, anticipated?

09:17.270 --> 09:18.711
Sinkholes are a natural phenomenon.

09:18.712 --> 09:20.456
There are a number
of predictive factors.

09:20.457 --> 09:22.722
There were unusual settling
noises in that neighborhood.

09:22.723 --> 09:23.957
You think she studied the factors

09:23.958 --> 09:25.058
that predicted the sinkhole?

09:25.059 --> 09:27.393
No. I'm saying there
are intuitive people who,

09:27.394 --> 09:29.862
without knowing it, are
putting together everything.

09:29.863 --> 09:31.697
Facebook posts, uh, news articles.

09:31.698 --> 09:35.401
This is not prophecy;
this is human nature.

09:35.402 --> 09:37.169
Kristen?

09:37.170 --> 09:38.328
It's true.

09:38.329 --> 09:40.397
I mean, there are people
with hyperdeveloped senses.

09:40.398 --> 09:42.543
If you dream about a ladder
rung breaking under your foot,

09:42.544 --> 09:44.602
and the next day it breaks,
that's not predictive.

09:44.603 --> 09:46.411
It's your unconscious
communicating to you

09:46.412 --> 09:47.643
what your senses registered

09:47.644 --> 09:49.511
in the split second
you stepped on it last.

09:49.512 --> 09:52.551
Okay. I guess we got
to go see her again.

09:52.552 --> 09:54.086
You interview her this time, Kristen.

09:54.087 --> 09:55.220
Definitely.

09:55.221 --> 09:57.222
I'm heading to soccer, Mom. Love you.

09:57.223 --> 09:59.458
- Wh-What's that?
- What?

09:59.459 --> 10:02.027
Your jacket, it's-it's red.

10:02.028 --> 10:03.696
Yeah. It's new.

10:05.398 --> 10:08.779
All right, would you
mind wearing this instead?

10:08.780 --> 10:10.880
- Why?
- I-I don't like

10:10.881 --> 10:12.649
the way red stands out.

10:12.650 --> 10:14.484
- That's weird.

me to wear her jacket.

10:21.757 --> 10:23.426
Why? I like that jacket.

10:23.427 --> 10:25.161
- Because she doesn't like red.
- What?

10:25.162 --> 10:26.362
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:26.363 --> 10:27.964
- Mom's getting weird.
- Yeah.

10:27.965 --> 10:29.899
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, yeah. Well, you are.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.701
- Bye.
- Go kick some butt.

10:31.702 --> 10:33.169
- I will. Okay. Love you. Bye.
- All right.

10:33.170 --> 10:34.637
And if you don't like red,

10:34.638 --> 10:36.039
why are you wearing those earrings?

10:37.074 --> 10:38.341
You seem happy.

10:38.342 --> 10:39.676
Is that about this new boyfriend?

10:39.677 --> 10:42.212
I don't need a boy to be happy.

10:42.213 --> 10:43.379
Want to meet him?

10:43.380 --> 10:45.315
You don't think we're too much?

10:45.316 --> 10:47.083
It'll be a good test, right?

10:47.084 --> 10:48.585
I'll get takeout.

10:48.586 --> 10:50.053
No, I'll cook dinner.

10:50.054 --> 10:51.721
- 6:00?
- Even better.

10:52.790 --> 10:54.581
Mm.

10:54.582 --> 10:56.583
You're gonna love him.

10:58.829 --> 11:00.163
Are you all right?

11:00.164 --> 11:02.098
I think I should be asking you that.

11:02.099 --> 11:03.463
Is that what they're usually like?

11:03.464 --> 11:05.802
- Exorcisms? That was my first one.
- Mm.

11:05.803 --> 11:07.737
I mean, I've dealt with schizophrenics

11:07.738 --> 11:09.639
and psychotics at Bellevue.

11:10.958 --> 11:12.959
I had a night terror again last night.

11:13.878 --> 11:16.145
That's the first in a while.

11:16.146 --> 11:18.229
With your... incubus, George?

11:18.230 --> 11:21.217
It started as a standard sexual fantasy.

11:21.218 --> 11:23.953
And then, for some reason,
George superseded it.

11:23.954 --> 11:26.089
What was the sexual fantasy?

11:27.124 --> 11:28.825
Nothing important.

11:31.262 --> 11:33.897
Okay, you might try something.

11:33.898 --> 11:34.898
Pills?

11:34.899 --> 11:36.299
No.

11:36.300 --> 11:37.767
Have you ever lucid dreamed?

11:37.768 --> 11:38.801
No.

11:38.802 --> 11:41.404
It's a way of controlling your dreams.

11:41.405 --> 11:43.940
You become aware that you're dreaming,

11:43.941 --> 11:47.944
and then you control it
and it doesn't control you.

11:47.945 --> 11:49.937
Here, tie this to your wrist.

11:49.938 --> 11:50.962
Why?

11:50.963 --> 11:54.937
Every hour on the hour,
set your iPhone to buzz.

11:54.938 --> 11:56.753
- Yeah.
- Look at your wrist.

11:56.754 --> 11:58.755
Stare at the blue string

11:58.756 --> 12:00.990
and ask yourself, "Am I dreaming?"

12:00.991 --> 12:02.158
I know.

12:02.159 --> 12:03.993
But ask no matter what.

12:03.994 --> 12:05.461
You're clearly not dreaming.

12:05.462 --> 12:07.864
But, tonight, your sleeping mind

12:07.865 --> 12:10.333
will continue the rhythm
of looking at your wrist.

12:10.334 --> 12:12.335
And at this point, you'll
know you're dreaming

12:12.336 --> 12:15.271
because there's no blue
string and wake up within it.

12:15.272 --> 12:16.606
Does that really work?

12:16.607 --> 12:18.608
Yes, it does. Try it tonight.

12:18.609 --> 12:21.010
It's a way of facing down George.

12:21.011 --> 12:23.479
And when I do that, what do I do?

12:23.480 --> 12:24.681
Kill him?

12:24.682 --> 12:26.783
No. You-you face him down,

12:26.784 --> 12:28.785
- ask him what he wants.
- Mm-hmm.

12:28.786 --> 12:29.814
Then tell him,

12:29.815 --> 12:32.088
"You have no power over me.

12:32.089 --> 12:35.926
I am in control of this
dream. Now go away".

12:39.530 --> 12:42.532
"I sometimes find my
dreams repeated in reality".

12:42.533 --> 12:43.800
True.

12:43.801 --> 12:46.102
"I seldom worry about my health".

12:46.103 --> 12:47.170
This is to test my... ?

12:47.171 --> 12:48.204
Intuition.

12:48.205 --> 12:49.572
It's created by the military.

12:49.573 --> 12:51.774
They found that some soldiers
showed an increased sixth sense

12:51.775 --> 12:53.977
of battlefield positioning.

12:53.978 --> 12:55.979
"I seldom worry about my health".

12:55.980 --> 12:58.147
Ask me questions you want to know.

12:58.148 --> 13:00.483
I do want to know this.

13:00.484 --> 13:02.352
No, you don't.

13:03.954 --> 13:06.956
Why can't you tell me
exactly what to be wary of?

13:06.957 --> 13:08.224
Why just red?

13:08.225 --> 13:10.293
Why not an accident with a red car

13:10.294 --> 13:12.295
or a man in a red shirt or...

13:12.296 --> 13:16.799
Because God is sometimes
specific and sometimes not.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.168
It's a bit convenient, isn't it?

13:19.169 --> 13:22.171
What language does God speak?

13:22.172 --> 13:23.906
Cantonese.

13:23.907 --> 13:25.641
Mandarin. English.

13:25.642 --> 13:28.144
Whatever best suits the moment.

13:28.145 --> 13:30.146
Anything else?

13:32.249 --> 13:34.350
Is my daughter, Laura...

13:34.351 --> 13:36.419
is she going to be all right?

13:36.420 --> 13:38.821
Be more specific.

13:40.190 --> 13:43.659
My daughter's health
issue, her heart valve,

13:43.660 --> 13:45.661
will it heal?

14:00.737 --> 14:02.104
Yes, it will heal.

14:05.682 --> 14:07.683
- You don't like that?
- No, I don't.

14:07.684 --> 14:09.752
- We should move on.
- Why?

14:09.753 --> 14:12.255
Because I think it's stupid,
you blowing up this idiotic toy

14:12.256 --> 14:13.990
to tell me about my daughter.

14:16.693 --> 14:19.128
We-we should get back to the test.

14:19.129 --> 14:21.531
I'm sorry.

14:21.532 --> 14:23.342
I-I'm-I'm sorry.

14:23.343 --> 14:24.700
I shouldn't have made it personal.

14:24.701 --> 14:26.702
It is personal.

14:52.405 --> 14:54.464
I gave her every
standardized precog test

14:54.465 --> 14:57.071
and even some of the much
less conventional ones.

14:57.072 --> 14:58.301
She scored 50%.

14:58.302 --> 14:59.359
Psychologically,

14:59.360 --> 15:00.918
she does not score as intuitive.

15:00.919 --> 15:03.339
I checked out her... statements,

15:03.340 --> 15:04.340
- and...
- Prophecies.

15:04.341 --> 15:06.175
Yeah.

15:06.176 --> 15:07.910
And many of them can't be checked.

15:07.911 --> 15:09.946
- Why not?
- They haven't happened yet.

15:09.947 --> 15:12.248
And the ones that have?

15:12.249 --> 15:14.083
Mm, 70% accurate.

15:14.084 --> 15:16.222
Not exactly divinity-level percentage.

15:16.223 --> 15:18.000
Well, some of them are
so specific and personal,

15:18.001 --> 15:19.361
it's hard to check their accuracy.

15:21.158 --> 15:24.060
Monsignor, why are we doing this?

15:26.196 --> 15:27.530
Let's talk,

15:27.531 --> 15:29.031
- just the two of us.
- No.

15:29.032 --> 15:31.367
Whatever you tell me,
I'll immediately tell them,

15:31.368 --> 15:34.070
so they might as well hear it from you.

15:35.548 --> 15:36.639
Uh, that's all right.

15:36.640 --> 15:37.673
We can step out.

15:37.674 --> 15:38.975
No, I'd like you to stay.

16:01.198 --> 16:03.199
What is it?

16:03.200 --> 16:05.668
The Poveglia Codex.

16:06.703 --> 16:09.138
Go ahead. It's a facsimile.

16:11.875 --> 16:13.376
Never heard of it.

16:13.377 --> 16:15.444
And you wouldn't have.

16:15.445 --> 16:19.415
Only a very few outside of the
Holy See even know it exists.

16:19.416 --> 16:20.616
What is it?

16:20.617 --> 16:21.651
Prophecies.

16:21.652 --> 16:23.519
15 pages of them.

16:23.520 --> 16:27.590
Transcribed by monks on the
island of Poveglia in 1550.

16:27.591 --> 16:30.426
From Benedetto Lapuente,
a Carthusian martyr.

16:30.427 --> 16:34.530
And this is the only
copy ever made of it.

16:34.531 --> 16:36.265
Why do you have the copy?

16:36.266 --> 16:40.603
Some of the prophecies have
been echoed word-for-word

16:40.604 --> 16:42.939
by your prophet.

16:42.940 --> 16:44.707
The day care lady in Flushing?

16:44.708 --> 16:45.708
Yes.

16:45.709 --> 16:47.043
How is that possible?

16:47.044 --> 16:48.444
I don't know.

16:48.445 --> 16:51.514
For 500 years, no copy of this document

16:51.515 --> 16:53.416
has left the Vatican Archive.

16:53.417 --> 16:56.352
Only the Holy See even knows it exists,

16:56.353 --> 16:59.689
and only the popes have seen
the prophecies themselves.

17:03.360 --> 17:06.194
So, how word-for-word
are we talking here?

17:06.195 --> 17:08.064
That's why you have this document.

17:08.065 --> 17:10.366
Translate it and check it.

17:10.367 --> 17:14.369
Assessors in the Vatican read
this news report about her,

17:14.371 --> 17:18.473
and the quote of a prophecy
was flagged as being identical.

17:18.474 --> 17:20.943
So the Vatican wants us to
see if she's telling the truth?

17:20.944 --> 17:23.613
Yes. And they'd rather she wasn't.

17:23.614 --> 17:25.548
Why?

17:25.549 --> 17:28.918
Because these prophecies are disastrous.

17:28.919 --> 17:30.052
For whom?

17:31.088 --> 17:33.089
For everyone.

17:34.795 --> 17:38.148
I mean, the whole thing is weird.

17:38.149 --> 17:41.099
The Vatican would really trust
us with this secret document?

17:41.100 --> 17:42.600
I don't know.

17:42.601 --> 17:43.868
Weirder things have happened.

17:43.869 --> 17:45.269
How much have you translated?

17:45.270 --> 17:46.404
About half.

17:46.405 --> 17:47.839
I should have it finished by tomorrow.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.574
Oh, hold on. That's my timer.

17:49.575 --> 17:51.743
I have it set for every hour.

17:53.479 --> 17:55.413
That's weird.

17:55.414 --> 17:57.148
What?

17:57.149 --> 17:58.983
It's not on my wrist.

17:58.984 --> 18:01.119
Could it have come off?

18:01.120 --> 18:03.121
Am I dreaming?

18:03.122 --> 18:05.323
Do you need help?

18:10.729 --> 18:13.231
Do you need help?

18:13.232 --> 18:15.533
I'm dreaming.

18:15.534 --> 18:18.770
And I know I'm dreaming.

18:18.771 --> 18:21.005
I can control it.

18:27.746 --> 18:30.014
Kristen!

18:30.015 --> 18:31.616
Who is that?!

18:34.983 --> 18:36.141
What?!

18:36.142 --> 18:37.342
Up ahead!

18:48.400 --> 18:49.801
You're mine.

18:49.802 --> 18:51.302
No!

18:51.303 --> 18:53.838
I control this dream!

19:06.051 --> 19:07.618
Get out of the way.

19:10.189 --> 19:12.256
You're in my dream.

19:14.493 --> 19:16.294
What do you want?

19:16.295 --> 19:17.662
A bite.

19:17.663 --> 19:19.330
You have no power here.

19:19.331 --> 19:21.632
I'm controlling this dream.

19:21.633 --> 19:25.169
Now get out... of the way.

19:30.375 --> 19:32.577
Oh, my God.

19:32.578 --> 19:36.347
Now I know why the codex was
kept hidden in the Vatican.

19:36.348 --> 19:38.683
It predicts the end
of the Catholic Church.

19:39.718 --> 19:41.219
Yes.

19:42.254 --> 19:44.555
What if Grace is telling the truth?

19:46.358 --> 19:48.693
It's a problem for us.

19:48.694 --> 19:51.696
But how could she know
what was written in 1550?

19:53.098 --> 19:55.433
There are other options.

19:55.434 --> 19:57.702
"Some come in sheep's clothing

19:57.703 --> 20:00.004
but inwardly are ravening wolves".

20:02.040 --> 20:04.308
You think she's a false prophet?

20:05.344 --> 20:08.079
We want her to be a false prophet.

20:08.080 --> 20:10.414
Help us find that out.

20:27.733 --> 20:29.734
Do you have visions of God?

20:30.769 --> 20:32.870
Why do you ask?

20:32.871 --> 20:34.872
Just a part of our questioning.

20:36.441 --> 20:37.842
No, it isn't.

20:40.746 --> 20:43.080
God loves you, David.

20:43.081 --> 20:45.783
You don't need to see
him to be loved by him.

20:49.087 --> 20:50.955
How do you know you hear God,

20:50.956 --> 20:53.558
that you're not hearing
someone or something else?

20:53.559 --> 20:54.692
Lucifer?

20:54.693 --> 20:55.726
Yes.

20:55.727 --> 20:58.129
I help people.

20:58.130 --> 21:00.965
Lucifer has no interest
in helping people.

21:00.966 --> 21:03.100
But doesn't evil come
bearing gifts of power

21:03.101 --> 21:05.136
in order to lure people?

21:05.137 --> 21:07.305
"For there shall arise false prophets,

21:07.306 --> 21:09.674
and they shall deceive the very elect".

21:09.675 --> 21:13.077
Yes, but "Ye shall know
them by their fruits".

21:15.098 --> 21:17.857
Do you hear God?

21:17.858 --> 21:20.317
I have.

21:20.318 --> 21:22.319
But not like you.

21:23.765 --> 21:27.601
And I can't be sure who
is talking to me sometimes.

21:36.468 --> 21:38.636
What does this mean?

21:39.856 --> 21:41.881
Three stars.

21:41.882 --> 21:44.875
Father, Son, Holy Ghost.

21:44.876 --> 21:46.910
Why are they on Earth?

21:53.986 --> 21:55.653
That's not Earth.

21:56.688 --> 21:58.456
What is it?

21:58.457 --> 22:00.157
Spherical geometry.

22:00.158 --> 22:02.860
A triangle in a 3-D space.

22:02.861 --> 22:04.996
So a pyramid.

22:04.997 --> 22:08.065
Technically, it's a Euler triangle.

23:01.541 --> 23:03.066
David, it's me.

23:03.067 --> 23:04.701
I realized what Grace was drawing.

23:07.884 --> 23:09.642
David?

23:09.643 --> 23:11.644
Are you home?

23:14.021 --> 23:15.258
Are you home?

23:15.259 --> 23:17.260
Coming.

23:35.921 --> 23:37.822
Hey. Sorry, but your phone was off,

23:37.823 --> 23:39.590
and I realized what Grace was drawing.

23:39.591 --> 23:41.592
Have a look.

23:43.416 --> 23:46.497
So, the gaps... they're not random.

23:46.498 --> 23:48.199
They fit into the codex.

23:51.278 --> 23:52.978
Are you okay?

23:52.979 --> 23:54.971
Mm. Yes.

23:54.972 --> 23:56.764
Okay.

23:56.765 --> 23:59.457
Show me.

23:59.458 --> 24:02.717
So... here.

24:02.718 --> 24:04.743
Look at the holes.

24:04.744 --> 24:06.278
You see?

24:07.486 --> 24:10.154
Wow.

24:10.155 --> 24:13.157
I mean... wow.

24:13.158 --> 24:14.658
Okay.

24:14.659 --> 24:17.661
We can just do this
tomorrow. It's-it's...

24:17.662 --> 24:19.663
No, no, no, no, no, no.

24:22.968 --> 24:24.602
Mm-hmm.

24:24.603 --> 24:26.704
Okay, well, why don't
you just get some rest,

24:26.705 --> 24:28.472
and, uh, we'll talk tomorrow.

24:52.631 --> 24:54.565
Who are you?

24:56.001 --> 24:57.735
- He's here. He's here.
- I'll get it.

24:57.736 --> 24:59.603
Wow! You look pretty!

24:59.604 --> 25:01.005
Oh, my goodness. Ooh, la, la!

25:01.006 --> 25:02.640
All right. All right, now stop it.

25:02.641 --> 25:03.808
You sound too rehearsed.

25:03.809 --> 25:04.975
Where... Where's your mom?

25:04.976 --> 25:06.844
Uh, late at work. She'll
be here soon, though.

25:06.845 --> 25:08.579
- Yeah, she'll bring cupcakes or something.
- Okay, okay, okay.

25:08.580 --> 25:10.620
Clean up, clean up, clean up.

25:11.383 --> 25:13.584
Hello. You're early.

25:13.585 --> 25:15.820
Couldn't wait to meet everyone.

25:19.641 --> 25:21.375
Daughters!

25:21.376 --> 25:23.001
You've got no candles that match.

25:23.002 --> 25:25.012
It's either birthday
candles or scented candles.

25:25.013 --> 25:26.180
Oh, my gosh.

25:26.181 --> 25:27.848
I completely forgot it's tonight.

25:27.849 --> 25:29.149
Meeting your boyfriend.

25:29.150 --> 25:30.684
It's all right. We made dinner.

25:30.685 --> 25:31.943
Oh, listen.

25:31.944 --> 25:35.055
He's not much of a cook, but
he thinks he is, so be nice.

25:35.056 --> 25:36.415
Got it. Where are the girls?

25:36.416 --> 25:39.809
Upstairs. Lee likes them
for some unfathomable reason.

25:39.810 --> 25:41.895
Oh, and be polite, please.

25:41.896 --> 25:43.843
He's worried about
his first impressions.

25:43.844 --> 25:46.000
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

25:47.435 --> 25:49.903
I like coffee, I like tea.

25:49.904 --> 25:52.406
I like the devil to dance with me.

25:52.407 --> 25:54.608
Count to seven. You're in heaven.

25:54.609 --> 25:57.077
Count to six, and you're in a ditch.

25:57.078 --> 26:00.147
One, two, three, four, five,

26:00.148 --> 26:01.315
six, seven.

26:01.316 --> 26:02.583
- Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

26:02.584 --> 26:03.884
This is Leland.

26:06.354 --> 26:08.856
Yeah, he's really nice. We all love him.

26:08.857 --> 26:10.190
You're gonna love him.

26:10.191 --> 26:11.959
How funny.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.861
Your mother and I know each other.

26:13.862 --> 26:15.896
Hi, Kristen.

26:15.897 --> 26:19.166
I never connected Sheryl and you.

26:19.167 --> 26:20.934
You guys know each other?

26:20.935 --> 26:24.038
- How do you know each other?
- Why aren't you saying anything?

26:24.039 --> 26:25.773
- Whoa! Whoa!
- I need you all to stay in here.

26:25.774 --> 26:27.074
Why? Wait!

26:27.075 --> 26:29.410
Downstairs.

26:29.411 --> 26:31.412
Now.

26:31.413 --> 26:32.719
It's true, Kristen.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.582
I really didn't know that
Sheryl was your mother.

26:35.583 --> 26:37.084
What a small world.

26:39.122 --> 26:40.880
Hey, dinner's almost ready.

26:40.881 --> 26:42.172
You won't believe this.

26:42.173 --> 26:44.206
Kristen and I know each other from work.

26:44.207 --> 26:46.427
- From the new job, really?
- No, the D.A.'s office.

26:46.428 --> 26:48.495
I work there as a
forensic psychologist, too.

26:48.496 --> 26:49.763
You're kidding.

26:49.764 --> 26:51.332
No. I just never put it together.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.491
Leland and I have to talk
for a minute, Mom, about work.

26:53.492 --> 26:55.050
Just this way, in the garage.

26:55.051 --> 26:56.228
Well, can't you talk after dinner?

26:56.229 --> 26:59.022
No, we need to talk now.
Just through the kitchen.

26:59.023 --> 27:01.591
Okay, but not too long, all right?

27:03.545 --> 27:05.579
My office is in the back.

27:10.435 --> 27:13.027
Wow. This is sweet back here.

27:13.028 --> 27:15.387
I need to get something like this.

27:15.388 --> 27:16.722
It's open.

27:19.728 --> 27:21.862
Wow.

27:25.734 --> 27:28.068
Look at these photos.

27:29.966 --> 27:32.306
Who knew you were such an adventurer?

27:34.247 --> 27:36.072
Kristen, Kristen.

27:36.073 --> 27:37.831
Shut the hell up!

27:37.832 --> 27:40.834
Look, I know we've had our differences.

27:48.523 --> 27:50.023
Oh, my God.

27:50.024 --> 27:51.925
Shut up. It's survivable.

27:51.926 --> 27:54.328
I didn't touch the carotid
arteries or the jugular vein.

27:54.329 --> 27:56.016
Why are you doing this?

27:56.017 --> 27:57.274
Hold this to your neck.

27:57.275 --> 27:59.767
I don't want a drop of
your blood on my floor.

27:59.768 --> 28:02.436
You're not coming back here. Ever.

28:02.437 --> 28:04.605
You're not seeing my kids.
You're not seeing my mom.

28:04.606 --> 28:05.873
You're not seeing me.

28:05.874 --> 28:08.442
You have another 20 minutes
to get to an emergency room

28:08.443 --> 28:10.210
before you get lightheaded
from blood loss.

28:10.211 --> 28:12.679
You'll need 20 stitches.
Do you understand?

28:16.284 --> 28:19.386
I have never been so turned on by you.

28:19.387 --> 28:23.123
Go now, before I cut deeper.

28:27.529 --> 28:29.229
You go around to your car.

28:31.566 --> 28:33.133
This is outrageous.

28:33.134 --> 28:34.568
Yeah, get used to it.

28:34.569 --> 28:36.770
You have 18 minutes.

28:36.771 --> 28:38.372
Keep the dish towel!

28:51.052 --> 28:53.120
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

28:53.121 --> 28:54.354
There was an accident,

28:54.355 --> 28:56.690
and Leland had to go to the hospital.

28:58.026 --> 28:59.493
What?

28:59.494 --> 29:01.628
Yeah, one of my ice axes in the garage

29:01.629 --> 29:04.798
just caught him on the neck,
so, um, he had to rush off.

29:04.799 --> 29:06.633
What are you talking about?

29:06.634 --> 29:07.935
Where is he?

29:07.936 --> 29:09.570
He's not back there. He left already.

29:09.571 --> 29:11.939
He didn't want to track
blood through the house.

29:13.341 --> 29:14.942
Did he make this?

29:14.943 --> 29:16.477
Kristen, why didn't you come get me?

29:16.478 --> 29:18.378
He was in a rush. Did Leland make this?

29:18.379 --> 29:20.914
Yes. This is insane. Why
are you acting so crazy?

29:20.915 --> 29:22.916
Oh, my God, what are you doing?

29:22.917 --> 29:24.618
- Cleaning up.
- Mom?

29:24.619 --> 29:26.620
Aren't we supposed to have dinner, Mom?

29:26.621 --> 29:27.821
Yes, we are.

29:27.822 --> 29:29.690
Um, I'm gonna heat up
the pizza from last night.

29:29.691 --> 29:31.725
- I thought we were having real dinner.
- And we are.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.594
I'm going to bring it to
your room, so go upstairs.

29:33.595 --> 29:35.062
You made a rule... we're not allowed

29:35.063 --> 29:36.429
to eat upstairs or in our bed.

29:36.430 --> 29:37.430
Correct. Go!

29:41.636 --> 29:42.970
Where are you going?

29:42.971 --> 29:44.438
What do you think? After him.

29:44.439 --> 29:46.240
No, Mom. Wait.

29:47.308 --> 29:49.443
I do not want him in my house again.

29:49.444 --> 29:50.677
What? Why?

29:50.678 --> 29:51.818
Because he's a bad man.

29:51.819 --> 29:53.380
Oh, my God.

29:53.381 --> 29:55.925
Kristen, your dad and I are
not getting back together, okay?

29:55.926 --> 29:56.984
What? It's not about that.

29:56.985 --> 29:59.219
I am meeting new men. You're
gonna have to get used to that.

29:59.220 --> 30:01.388
He's a psychopath, Mother.

30:01.389 --> 30:03.390
Oh, dear God.

30:03.391 --> 30:06.460
I ask one thing of
you... to be nice to him.

30:06.461 --> 30:09.296
Hi. Yeah, where are you?

30:09.297 --> 30:10.831
I know. I just heard.

30:10.832 --> 30:12.299
I am so sorry.

30:12.300 --> 30:13.767
I'm coming right now.

30:17.672 --> 30:20.240
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

30:20.241 --> 30:21.608
- eight, nine, ten!
- Not fair!

30:21.609 --> 30:23.043
- You made me lose on purpose!
- How is it not fair?

30:23.044 --> 30:24.044
That was totally fair.

30:24.045 --> 30:25.312
- It's not fair!
- Yes. Finally.

30:25.313 --> 30:27.748
Oh, my gosh, I was so hungry.

30:27.749 --> 30:29.516
- Yummy.
- So tell me about Grandma's new friend.

30:29.517 --> 30:31.418
- He was really nice.
- Yeah, we like him.

30:31.419 --> 30:33.320
- Mom, this pizza's cold.
- Yeah, it's cold.

30:33.321 --> 30:34.821
- Why didn't you reheat it? Yeah, it is cold.
- Exactly.

30:34.822 --> 30:36.456
It's cold, Mom.

30:36.457 --> 30:38.091
What's this? Did he give you gifts?

30:38.092 --> 30:39.259
Yeah, they're diaries.

30:39.260 --> 30:40.761
- Look, they have unicorns.
- They're actually nice.

30:40.762 --> 30:42.682
- Come look at mine.
- Yeah, they're really nice.

30:45.667 --> 30:47.034
What's this? Did he make this?

30:47.035 --> 30:48.602
Yeah, he was teaching us how to draw.

30:48.603 --> 30:49.770
He's actually pretty good.

30:49.771 --> 30:50.971
Okay, I'm going to have to take these.

30:50.972 --> 30:52.306
- What is wrong with a journal?
- Mom!

30:52.307 --> 30:53.640
Mom!

30:53.641 --> 30:55.809
Eat your cold pizza, and I'll be back!

31:47.405 --> 31:50.197
Hi. You've reached
the voice mail of David Acosta.

31:50.198 --> 31:52.366
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

32:00.908 --> 32:02.643
I know. Pretty cool, huh?

32:02.644 --> 32:04.745
Grace drew up three
more prophecies like this,

32:04.746 --> 32:06.947
but they don't fit
the pages you gave us.

32:06.948 --> 32:10.050
That made us think that maybe
you were holding back some.

32:10.051 --> 32:11.284
Did you translate it?

32:11.285 --> 32:12.552
Yes.

32:12.553 --> 32:14.755
Are you holding back some pages?

32:17.759 --> 32:19.826
The codex is 280 pages.

32:19.827 --> 32:21.962
This is just a part of it.

32:21.963 --> 32:23.430
What does it say?

32:23.431 --> 32:26.466
The full prophecy isn't about
the Catholic Church ending.

32:26.467 --> 32:28.168
It's about the world ending.

32:30.204 --> 32:31.872
Okay.

32:31.873 --> 32:33.607
This is what you have to do.

32:33.608 --> 32:35.042
Get to this woman, Grace,

32:35.043 --> 32:37.544
have her draw up all the pages
she knows about the Codex.

32:37.545 --> 32:41.214
So what are you saying,
she's a true prophet?

32:41.215 --> 32:43.116
Or a false one. Get to her.

32:43.117 --> 32:45.519
Have her finish her prophecy.
Then we'll know.

32:49.490 --> 32:50.913
- What do you think?
- What?

32:50.914 --> 32:53.860
Is she a true prophet?
What, are you nuts?

32:53.861 --> 32:55.862
- Then how?
- Okay.

32:55.863 --> 32:58.532
The Vatican says they have
a double-secret document

32:58.533 --> 33:00.934
that no one has ever seen. No one.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.703
Just a lot of popes and us.

33:02.704 --> 33:04.771
Just three nobodies from Queens.

33:04.772 --> 33:07.040
For five centuries,
no one has seen this.

33:07.041 --> 33:08.275
This is the same organization

33:08.276 --> 33:10.577
that can't get its act
together on child rape.

33:10.578 --> 33:12.245
Here's what I think:

33:12.246 --> 33:13.947
I think that document has been slipped

33:13.948 --> 33:15.816
to thousands of people
over the centuries

33:15.817 --> 33:18.318
and they've all been told
exactly the same thing:

33:18.319 --> 33:20.754
"You're special. You're
the only one who's seen it".

33:20.755 --> 33:23.123
And somehow, it's gotten out there,

33:23.124 --> 33:25.392
because people want to share a secret.

33:25.393 --> 33:27.975
And somehow Grace saw it.

33:27.976 --> 33:31.264
Maybe she didn't know she
saw it, but she saw it.

33:32.738 --> 33:35.130
If you believe all that
about the Catholic Church,

33:35.131 --> 33:36.956
how can you work for them?

33:36.957 --> 33:40.049
I don't work for them. I work for David.

33:40.050 --> 33:41.408
And I like David.

33:41.409 --> 33:42.533
Mm.

33:42.534 --> 33:44.092
And you.

33:44.093 --> 33:45.384
Aw, shucks.

33:45.385 --> 33:47.714
Okay, I take it back.

33:47.715 --> 33:49.616
No, I like working with you, too.

33:50.618 --> 33:52.119
Uh, Kristen, you got a minute?

33:52.120 --> 33:53.920
- Yes.
- I'll see you guys out there.

33:57.391 --> 34:00.096
- About last night...
- N-N-No.

34:00.097 --> 34:02.089
You really don't have to say
anything; it was a mistake.

34:02.090 --> 34:03.681
- No, I-I just want to make clear...
- It's fine.

34:03.682 --> 34:04.973
It's-it's really none of my business.

34:04.974 --> 34:06.508
Wait.

34:09.504 --> 34:11.938
It's how I see God.

34:11.938 --> 34:14.873
I had an epiphany a long time ago,

34:14.875 --> 34:17.567
and I felt God was trying
to tell me something.

34:17.568 --> 34:21.128
But he's been silent since.

34:21.129 --> 34:22.929
So I...

34:25.085 --> 34:26.887
I help it along.

34:26.888 --> 34:28.955
That's why Leland wanted me to ask you

34:28.956 --> 34:30.791
about the second time you saw God.

34:30.792 --> 34:32.092
He knows about this.

34:32.092 --> 34:33.193
Yes.

34:35.228 --> 34:37.197
How do you know you're seeing God,

34:37.197 --> 34:39.266
and not just the inside of your head?

34:39.266 --> 34:42.335
I don't.

34:42.335 --> 34:44.670
Okay.

34:46.206 --> 34:47.741
You gonna be safe?

34:47.742 --> 34:50.110
I will be.

34:53.214 --> 34:55.447
Hey, you called me last night.
W-What was that about?

34:55.449 --> 34:57.551
Oh. Um, nothing.

34:57.552 --> 35:00.887
Just something I, um,
took care of myself.

35:00.888 --> 35:02.722
What was it?

35:02.723 --> 35:04.057
Nothing.

35:11.532 --> 35:13.099
Sir, we're looking for Grace.

35:15.203 --> 35:17.304
You're her damn lawyer.

35:17.305 --> 35:19.439
She needs you down there right now.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.608
Yeah.

35:21.609 --> 35:22.776
ICE raid.

35:22.777 --> 35:24.945
Immigration grabbed
a couple of our kids.

35:24.946 --> 35:27.614
Grace's immigration
status was expired, so...

35:27.615 --> 35:30.851
That is why I wanted
you to talk with her,

35:30.852 --> 35:32.285
so the Church could help her.

35:32.286 --> 35:33.520
Where is she?

35:33.521 --> 35:35.222
Where's Grace?

35:35.223 --> 35:37.023
They took her.

35:40.684 --> 35:42.475
What are you trying to do?

35:42.476 --> 35:45.010
Play on my better nature, Kristen?

35:45.011 --> 35:47.780
Seriously. Is that really your plan?

35:47.781 --> 35:49.181
Look, he's just a kid.

35:49.182 --> 35:51.750
His second prison rape
and he won't be anymore.

35:55.956 --> 35:58.257
No. He didn't say that.

35:58.258 --> 35:59.725
He did, Mom.

35:59.726 --> 36:01.951
He really did.

36:01.952 --> 36:03.731
He's a psychopath.

36:03.732 --> 36:06.432
You can't date him.

36:07.434 --> 36:09.034
Face it, Kristen.

36:09.035 --> 36:11.270
You're trying to play
on my better nature,

36:11.271 --> 36:13.105
and I don't have any available for you.

36:16.042 --> 36:17.910
You can't date him, Mom.

36:31.758 --> 36:33.459
Did they say when they're moving her?

36:33.460 --> 36:35.227
Yes, anytime.

36:35.228 --> 36:37.596
Can you argue that she'll
face religious persecution

36:37.597 --> 36:39.298
- if she's sent back home?
- We can argue.

36:39.299 --> 36:41.400
But our lawyers are
hesitant that we'd succeed.

36:41.401 --> 36:44.236
I have the monsignor making
a plea on her account.

36:44.237 --> 36:46.105
Thank you.

36:46.106 --> 36:47.640
I'm afraid of the reeducation camps

36:47.641 --> 36:48.941
for the religious back home.

36:48.942 --> 36:51.110
Daniel Ling.

36:56.282 --> 36:57.983
- Daniel Ling?
- Yes.

36:57.984 --> 36:59.785
She can only have one visitor.

36:59.786 --> 37:01.320
I'm her lawyer.

37:16.636 --> 37:19.638
Sorry. Uh, David thinks
that you can help him.

37:20.974 --> 37:22.575
Hello, David.

37:22.576 --> 37:24.677
Grace, I'm sorry about
these circumstances.

37:24.678 --> 37:25.811
We don't have much time.

37:25.812 --> 37:27.877
- You have a question you want to ask me?
- Yes.

37:27.878 --> 37:30.015
This is the Poveglia Codex.

37:30.016 --> 37:32.451
Your last prophecy filled a hole in it.

37:32.452 --> 37:34.153
The Church thinks you can fill in more.

37:34.154 --> 37:36.355
- The monsignor wants...
- Can I look at it?

37:36.356 --> 37:37.447
All right.

37:37.448 --> 37:38.994
Medical tents have arrived.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.626
It will start in sector two.

37:40.627 --> 37:43.596
All those wanting to see
them, please see a guard.

37:43.597 --> 37:46.599
Sir, can I borrow your
pad and pen, please?

37:47.926 --> 37:49.835
Detainees in sector three,

37:49.836 --> 37:51.704
your visiting hour is
ending in five minutes.

37:51.705 --> 37:53.072
Thank you.

37:53.073 --> 37:56.475
Visiting hours are
ending in five minutes.

38:11.996 --> 38:14.293
Attention, section E supervisors.

38:14.294 --> 38:16.520
Attention, section E supervisors.

38:16.521 --> 38:19.013
Transport shuttles are
arriving at the south gate.

38:19.014 --> 38:21.072
Prepare all detainees for transfer.

38:36.450 --> 38:39.151
Sir, could you give this
to the gentleman over there?

38:39.152 --> 38:40.286
Thank you.

38:41.354 --> 38:42.855
All squad commanders,

38:42.856 --> 38:45.090
this is the last call
for visitation privileges.

38:45.091 --> 38:47.827
Transports will depart in ten minutes.

38:51.264 --> 38:54.366
Sector three detainees,
please prepare for transport.

38:54.367 --> 38:56.368
Your bus has arrived.

39:01.975 --> 39:03.375
Hey.

39:04.241 --> 39:07.267
Greetings from the Adriatic Sea.

39:07.268 --> 39:09.927
Salamander brandy.

39:09.928 --> 39:12.585
A very rare delight.

39:12.586 --> 39:16.188
After one glass of this,
you won't know up from down.

39:16.189 --> 39:19.091
Thank you.

39:19.092 --> 39:20.426
Leland, how's your neck?

39:20.427 --> 39:22.561
- Better. 20 stitches.
- Oh.

39:22.562 --> 39:23.963
It gives me character.

39:26.399 --> 39:29.368
What's wrong, babe?

39:29.369 --> 39:31.203
You and I have to talk.

39:32.272 --> 39:34.075
Damn. I went too fast, didn't I?

39:34.076 --> 39:35.574
No, that's not it.

39:35.575 --> 39:36.900
- It is.
- No. No.

39:36.901 --> 39:38.410
I always poison these relationships

39:38.411 --> 39:39.845
by getting too romantic too fast.

39:39.846 --> 39:40.980
No. It isn't that.

39:40.981 --> 39:42.581
It's...

39:42.582 --> 39:43.782
It's my daughter.

39:43.783 --> 39:47.121
What? She didn't like me?

39:47.122 --> 39:48.144
No.

39:48.145 --> 39:51.026
- She thinks you sabotaged her job at work.
- Oh, no.

39:51.027 --> 39:53.116
No. I-I... I don't want
to get into the details.

39:53.117 --> 39:54.708
I just...

39:54.709 --> 39:56.401
I have to put my family first.

39:56.402 --> 39:58.870
They... they mean everything to me.

40:02.936 --> 40:05.538
I understand.

40:05.539 --> 40:08.707
Family is everything to me as well.

40:08.708 --> 40:10.209
Thank you.

40:12.546 --> 40:14.547
So...

40:14.548 --> 40:16.448
I'm sorry it has to end this way.

40:16.449 --> 40:18.117
Me, too.

40:18.118 --> 40:20.619
Well...

40:20.620 --> 40:23.422
could we at least have one last kiss?

40:23.423 --> 40:25.424
Sure.
