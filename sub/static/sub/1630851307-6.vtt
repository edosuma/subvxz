00:05.088 --> 00:06.006
Previously, on
"Below Deck Med"...

00:06.506 --> 00:07.674
Cheers!

00:07.716 --> 00:09.259
-Someone get me a hooker.
-Mat!

00:09.300 --> 00:10.677
It's like [bleep] you,
I'm going home.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.053
I quit.
Get out of my ----ing face.

00:12.095 --> 00:14.264
Hey!

00:16.099 --> 00:17.684
Why are you so angry, Lloyd?

00:17.726 --> 00:21.521
You're a ----ing bosun,
stand the [bleep] down!

00:21.563 --> 00:23.106
-She is...
-Stop being a kiss-ass.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.524
You must stop your sh--.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.276
No, you're being a
kiss-ass, [bleep] off.

00:26.317 --> 00:27.485
Hey, whoa, hey!

00:31.448 --> 00:32.782
She's a fake-ass bitch.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.367
She is not a fake person,
she's is...

00:34.409 --> 00:36.327
Z, stop being a kiss-ass.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.704
You must stop your sh--.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.497
No, you're being
a kiss-ass [bleep] off.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.665
Hey, whoa, hey, enough, enough.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.667
Stop your ----ing sh--!

00:42.709 --> 00:45.378
Go to bed.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.255
You can slap me as much as
you want, sweetheart.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.548
-You ----ing...
-You...

00:48.590 --> 00:50.425
No, maybe honestly...
no, no, no one.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.761
Come on, Z, no, no, no,
just ----ing stay there.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.555
Lexi, do you not understand

00:55.597 --> 00:57.390
that you're really
pissing off a lot of...

00:57.432 --> 00:59.059
Stop. Stop.
Just stop. Just stop. Just stop.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.852
Just stop...
stop, stop, stop saying words.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.812
If you're...
whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:02.854 --> 01:05.732
How much noise do you wanna make
before you realize you're wrong?

01:05.774 --> 01:07.233
The captain's not waking up.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.735
No, are you wrong?

01:08.777 --> 01:10.403
Okay, okay, you're talking...
I'll listen.

01:10.445 --> 01:11.446
Come on, talk.
I'll listen, if you wanna talk.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.365
My rank.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.284
How long have you been in
yachting?

01:16.326 --> 01:17.285
Four years.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.620
I'm just, like...

01:18.661 --> 01:20.246
-No, I know...
-Like, the other night...

01:20.288 --> 01:22.123
She opened up
to me about her dad,

01:22.165 --> 01:23.625
and I was there for her.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.378
And now she's just
being a horrible person.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.629
-I said...
-Okay, what's the question?

01:27.671 --> 01:28.630
What is your position
on the boat?

01:28.672 --> 01:30.090
Deckhand.

01:30.131 --> 01:33.134
-You're lazy as [bleep] .
-Yeah?

01:33.176 --> 01:35.303
I do wash a teak, yeah.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.429
I'm not even lead deckhand,
sweetheart,

01:36.471 --> 01:40.266
I'm just a deckhand.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.476
And that is it.
That is all I have going for me.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.186
Seriously.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.855
-You're disgusting.
-Go to bed.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.149
You can't even ----ing
drive a tender.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.359
You're ----ing wack as sh--.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.403
-Go to bed.
-Oh, tell me again.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.779
Don't touch me.

01:52.821 --> 01:53.780
You're wack.
I'm not touching you.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.365
Mate, go... stop that...

01:55.407 --> 01:56.658
Oh, it's a barrier,
shut the [bleep] up.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.785
-You don't need a barrier.
-Stop!

01:58.827 --> 02:02.455
Leave my ----ing boys alone,
and get the [bleep] out.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.873
He's going to bed.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.542
Just leave it.
You're being ----ing toxic.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.918
Shut the [bleep] up!

02:06.960 --> 02:08.211
Lexi, please go to bed.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.504
You're a ----ing dick.

02:09.546 --> 02:12.215
-Thank you.
-Lexi... Lexi, go to bed.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.137
Okay, there we go.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.722
Okay, Malia, we need to make
decisions.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.348
Should I make you a bed?

02:20.390 --> 02:21.474
Otherwise, you're going
to the boys' cabin

02:21.516 --> 02:22.475
and sleep in the other bed.

02:22.517 --> 02:23.685
Sleepover!

02:23.727 --> 02:25.145
-Oh, my God.
-She's in.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.187
Now you're in here.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.647
Oh!

02:27.689 --> 02:31.317
Love you guys,
I'm sorry for my stewardess.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.486
Hey, lads, thanks, guys.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.447
We got each other's backs.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.702
Deck crew, I love you guys.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.580
Love you guys,
I'm sorry for my stewardess.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.832
Katie, we appreciate you.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.585
Old news...
has anyone seen my cabin mate?

02:48.626 --> 02:50.503
No.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.921
I think he's ----ing gone-gone.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.173
-Yeah.
-All his clothes are gone.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.341
Yeah, he's proper gone.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.717
[bleep]

03:02.432 --> 03:04.267
What the [bleep].

03:04.309 --> 03:05.894
Jeez.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.733
[alarm ringing]

03:27.874 --> 03:28.917
Really?

03:32.962 --> 03:35.548
Waking up this morning,
everything just feels heavy.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.385
And it's hard, because I do
feel empathetic towards her,

03:38.426 --> 03:40.679
because I know she's going
through a sh-- time.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.722
We all have a story, right?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.599
Did your dad die?

03:44.641 --> 03:47.477
I've never had to deal with
something like this before.

03:47.519 --> 03:50.313
Like, letting her stay,
is that like letting it slide?

03:50.355 --> 03:54.776
Like, I'm confused about it,
what the best thing to do is.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.446
-Morning.
-Good morning, Captain.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.698
How are you?

03:59.739 --> 04:01.574
I have a bad headache.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.411
We had fun.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.870
Like, we had...
like, we had...

04:05.912 --> 04:07.288
there was a lot of drinks,
so we had fun.

04:10.917 --> 04:11.960
Yeah...

04:15.672 --> 04:17.382
We were all, like, intoxicated.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.758
I had a part in that,
because I said some stuff

04:18.800 --> 04:20.677
and they said some stuff,

04:20.719 --> 04:22.804
but it's just, like, I can get
over it and work, can you?

04:22.846 --> 04:24.764
-Just, you know...
-Yeah.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.307
Apologize.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.642
I know, I want to, but
it's, like,

04:27.684 --> 04:29.269
I wanna be authentic,

04:29.310 --> 04:30.854
and I don't know
what I'm apologizing for.

04:30.895 --> 04:31.938
So then say that.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.481
Mm, that's a good thing.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.482
Yeah, why didn't
I think about that?

04:34.524 --> 04:36.443
Yeah.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.028
Like, I'm not gonna apologize
to you if I don't believe

04:38.069 --> 04:40.572
that it's necessary, or
if I don't believe in it.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.616
Like, all my apologies have
to come from a real place,

04:43.658 --> 04:45.994
or what's the point
of apologizing?

04:46.036 --> 04:47.912
-Yeah.
-That's truthful, right?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.414
Yeah.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.540
I think if you just stick
to the truth...

04:50.582 --> 04:52.709
-Yeah.
-People are reasonable.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.712
And they give them at least
24 hours to get over it.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.297
That's true.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.423
I'll do that,
I'll take your advice.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.424
-Yeah.
-I'll do that.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.467
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

05:00.508 --> 05:01.551
All right, good luck.

05:03.595 --> 05:04.804
Yeah, can you start with that?

05:05.764 --> 05:07.390
Good, we have some wind.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.976
You heard the stories
about Chef?

05:10.018 --> 05:11.019
No.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.024
I'm done.
I'm done, I'm just...

05:16.066 --> 05:17.984
Stop ----ing walking with me.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.527
Get off my ----ing face.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.700
The chef?

05:25.742 --> 05:27.410
He left?

05:27.452 --> 05:28.495
Why?

05:29.704 --> 05:30.789
I was here.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.123
So, Cheffy's gone?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.124
I don't know.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.709
Is his stuff gone, David?

05:34.751 --> 05:37.379
Yeah, he's done full
supermarket sweep.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.672
He just left?

05:38.713 --> 05:40.632
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.675
I thought he was happy?

05:41.716 --> 05:44.511
I mean... that's wild.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.681
I have a charter that starts
tomorrow, I have no chef.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.016
I gotta go and have a meltdown.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.519
If you signed up
for a job, show up.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.979
Lloyd, I love you.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.899
Pardon me.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.652
Hi.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.362
Where's my radio?

06:02.404 --> 06:05.907
-Is your lip okay?
-Yeah.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.575
Lexi's behavior
last night definitely

06:07.617 --> 06:09.703
made things fairly tense.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.538
-Z...
-No, I'm not being rude to you.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.581
Take your Afrikaans ass and
go the [bleep] away.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.171
So, I don't know if she was
trying to play on the fact

06:20.213 --> 06:22.382
that I'm adopted
and have a white family,

06:22.424 --> 06:23.925
but I think she
was differently trying to be

06:23.967 --> 06:25.593
derogatory and harsh.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.137
She's just completely ignorant.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.638
She hasn't apologized,
like, nothing.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.892
Nice.

06:32.934 --> 06:36.146
All right, deck crew, could we
get on deck, where we belong?

06:36.187 --> 06:37.814
I can't believe the chef's gone.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.149
What do you mean, gone?

06:39.190 --> 06:41.651
Gone. What else can I mean?

06:41.693 --> 06:43.069
-Gone.
-Last night, I think,

06:43.111 --> 06:44.904
it's me, Malia, and
David had an argument.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.072
No, I know.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.657
But that's all I can remember.

06:47.699 --> 06:48.825
His credit card and his
iPod's still here.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.160
I mean, do you not
want your money?

06:50.201 --> 06:51.453
That should be
the first thing you take.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.462
Captain Sandy, Katie.
Can you meet me in the bridge?

07:00.503 --> 07:01.629
Copy.

07:04.924 --> 07:05.884
You're not leaving, are you?

07:05.925 --> 07:06.926
No, I'm not.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.178
Oh, thank God.
I mean...

07:08.219 --> 07:11.139
I had a big problem with Lexi.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.183
She's lost her father recently,

07:13.224 --> 07:14.893
so she was really
upset about that.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.688
When we came back,
we went up to the hot tub,

07:18.730 --> 07:19.939
we were all just
drinking up there.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.649
I left.

07:21.691 --> 07:25.612
I still don't really know,
like, what happened,

07:25.653 --> 07:27.697
so I went up there, and
she's, like,

07:27.739 --> 07:29.908
saying really nasty
things to Malia.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.160
Like about all she cares
about is her...

07:42.712 --> 07:44.172
I still don't really know what
happened, so I went up there,

07:45.840 --> 07:47.676
and she's saying really
nasty things to Malia,

07:47.717 --> 07:50.220
like about all she
cares about is her...

07:50.261 --> 07:53.014
Pardon me.
Hi... sorry, Captain.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.557
-This is about you.
-Oh.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.142
Come on in.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.645
First, I wanna say I'm really
sorry about your father.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.271
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.856
So, I'm getting the download
what happened last night.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.566
Yeah.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.695
I came up, and then
you're screaming at Malia,

08:06.736 --> 08:08.530
saying really terrible things.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.990
Then something happened
with you and Z, and you...

08:11.032 --> 08:12.826
No, not Z, David.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.202
Like, he was screaming at me,
and I was screaming back at him.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.122
-It was a scream fest.
-It was horrendous.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.040
Let's try to mend this.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.543
I think this calls for,
like, a crew meeting.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.044
-Mm-hmm.
-Let's get it out on the table.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.630
If there's anything that
you don't remember,

08:25.672 --> 08:26.881
just be open
to people sharing...

08:26.923 --> 08:28.550
-Yeah.
-What they remember.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.677
And then move forward,
because we got a charter,

08:30.719 --> 08:32.804
and we got no chef.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.265
So, for me, that's
a huge thing right now.

08:35.306 --> 08:38.018
So, we all have
to check our emotions.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.936
And plus you're tired, hungover.

08:39.978 --> 08:42.564
So, no matter what happens,

08:42.605 --> 08:44.065
let's just don't lose it, okay?

08:44.107 --> 08:45.150
-All right.
-Okay.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.693
Thanks.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.902
Let's get to it.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.154
Can I get the hose?

08:49.195 --> 08:50.155
Yeah, you can take it.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.948
Oops.

08:51.990 --> 08:55.618
All crew, all crew, meet me
in the main salon for a meeting.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.786
Copy.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.747
Doesn't sound good.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.248
We don't have a chef,

09:00.290 --> 09:02.584
and I can't just go
replace another crewmember.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.712
So, I wanna allow Lexi
an opportunity to own it,

09:05.754 --> 09:07.255
and to be able to have
that second chance.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.256
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.133
Good morning.

09:10.175 --> 09:14.929
Okay. What I want is to have my
crew back for my charter.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.640
So, this is up to you.

09:17.682 --> 09:21.061
Do we forgive,
but still hold accountable?

09:21.102 --> 09:23.772
These are questions for you.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.690
I mean, like, me and Malia
had our thing in the cabin,

09:25.732 --> 09:27.692
and it spilled over
to the hot tub.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.362
I really don't remember, but I
know me and David got arguing.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.073
But I wanna apologize
for screaming at you.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.783
But you were screaming
at me as well, so.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.827
And Malia, we had an issue.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.329
I don't know
what I completely said.

09:39.371 --> 09:42.082
You made some really personal,
inappropriate comments.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.375
And not just to me.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.918
You owe an apology
to Z as well, and Lloyd.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.127
What?
Um, I don't remember what I...

09:46.169 --> 09:47.128
-I...
-I know you don't.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.296
I said that the only...

09:48.338 --> 09:49.839
-But this is... this is...
-Okay...

09:49.881 --> 09:51.132
Lexi, you can be defensive,
if you want.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.842
You were screaming
at us, telling us

09:52.884 --> 09:54.302
you were better than all
of us, I mean, you're so...

09:54.344 --> 09:55.887
When did I say that?
That's not true.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.263
I never said that to anyone.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.099
Did I say that to you?

09:59.140 --> 10:00.308
No, I didn't say that to you.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.851
No, you're...
you're, like...

10:01.893 --> 10:02.852
I had 20 minutes of
you putting me down.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.688
Okay, let me just stop.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.189
If you don't remember, just
listen without defending.

10:06.231 --> 10:10.068
You were very worked up,
so we all got involved.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.444
A lot of us were
trying to mediate...

10:11.486 --> 10:13.363
Okay, I understand.

10:13.405 --> 10:18.326
So, yes, I apologize, Katie,
David, for my stuff last night.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.954
I will talk to Malia separately.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.833
Words can
sometimes affect people,

10:24.874 --> 10:26.960
and we can't take it back.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.754
The only thing
we can do is reset.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.132
You're all assets to me.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.343
I feel like you guys
can figure this out.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.054
On top of this,
we don't have a chef.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.098
Wait, like, he's gone?

10:40.140 --> 10:42.058
Gone.
I have to deal with that.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.019
I'm gonna leave you to it.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.311
We don't wanna
nail you to a cross.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.354
Mm-hmm.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.731
But I'm sorry for my part in it.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.149
All of us are now
aware

10:49.190 --> 10:51.401
you went through something
really difficult.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.322
I'm just gonna go
and see if she's okay.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.368
Lex?

11:00.410 --> 11:01.369
Lexi?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.997
Can I come in?

11:04.039 --> 11:05.206
I'm fine.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.000
Just let me in, please.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.877
I'll come out soon.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.254
I'm just...
I just need five minutes.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.131
Okay, you sure
you don't want me to come in?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.174
No.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.717
I love you.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.261
I just need five minutes.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.930
Yeah, she's in the bathroom,
but I can't go in.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.808
Is everyone feeling okay,
like they can get past it?

11:23.850 --> 11:25.727
I'm past it.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.062
Lloyd?

11:27.103 --> 11:29.314
Yeah, I'm good, yeah.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.733
The fact that she hasn't
said an honest apology

11:31.775 --> 11:33.818
really makes me think
that she doesn't feel bad

11:33.860 --> 11:35.111
about it at all.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.241
Unfortunately, it does eat
away a little bit at me.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.826
Tomorrow will be a new day.

11:41.868 --> 11:42.994
-Yeah.
-Let's hope we find a chef.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.079
-Yes!
-Yeah.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.081
Yeah [bleep].

11:51.169 --> 11:53.088
From the very first day,

11:53.129 --> 11:55.131
thinking that Mathew
wasn't coming back...

11:55.173 --> 11:58.134
I can't do this.

11:58.176 --> 12:01.554
The first thing I did was call
and get a chef into quarantine.

12:01.596 --> 12:05.058
I've been one week
in quarantine.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.559
I'm getting a little bit fat.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.104
Hopefully it will be done soon.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.772
Luka won't be ready
for a couple more days,

12:10.814 --> 12:13.400
which complicates it
when we have a charter

12:13.441 --> 12:15.568
starting in one day.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.529
I mean, what do I do?

12:18.613 --> 12:20.407
<i>Lexi, Lexi, Katie.</i>

12:20.448 --> 12:22.242
<i>Can you meet me</i>
<i>in the crew mess?</i>

12:22.283 --> 12:23.576
<i>Copy.</i>

12:23.618 --> 12:26.496
Mate, is there not
a deck blade up here?

12:26.538 --> 12:28.123
Oh... twat.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.425
David, you ----ing kiss-ass
mother----er.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.926
That's hard to answer.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.845
I started the night
with a game plan,

12:41.886 --> 12:44.389
see if she makes a move,
and very quickly,

12:44.431 --> 12:46.891
that turned into
maybe I should just find out

12:46.933 --> 12:47.892
what the move should be.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.310
All Gucci?

12:49.352 --> 12:51.229
And she was, like, "Well,
I can't really

12:51.271 --> 12:52.939
answer that right now," and I
was like, okay, that's cool,

12:52.981 --> 12:54.858
it's not a yes or a no,
it's just ----ing...

12:54.899 --> 12:55.859
Yeah.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.402
Take the maybe, and move on.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.362
Right, maybe she'll come around.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.989
Yeah.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.866
-Now she knows.
-Yeah, now she knows.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.159
Okay, you can start in laundry.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.577
Yep.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.829
Can you go straight into VIP,
make the bed,

13:07.871 --> 13:09.205
and getting that cabin ready?

13:12.167 --> 13:13.543
Last night was horrendous.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.047
Now it's become my problem,

13:17.088 --> 13:18.173
because it's, like,
my department,

13:18.214 --> 13:20.258
which ----ing infuriates me.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.140
I'm turning the hose on,
watch your feet.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.392
-Eew, is that gum?
-That's gum.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.269
Who the [bleep] put gum
in the hot tub?

13:40.070 --> 13:41.196
I'm so sorry about last night.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.447
I'm full of regret.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.490
You're full of regrets?

13:43.531 --> 13:45.283
Yeah, I'm... I'm a dick.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.284
Don't worry, man,
all is forgiven.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.369
Nasty.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.578
-What's up?
-Hey, man.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.205
-Are you back for good?
-I hope so.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.623
I'm gonna talk to the captain.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.128
Waking up this morning,

13:57.170 --> 13:59.214
I realized I made a rash
decision last night.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.508
Did someone knock on my door?

14:01.549 --> 14:03.176
I was wasted.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.345
-Oh, let me...
-Sorry.

14:05.387 --> 14:06.638
I'll meet you on the bridge.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.391
-Okay.
-I'm gonna wash my hands, okay.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.226
Hey, Marten, I'm sorry
about last night.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.227
I owe you an apology.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.395
It's all right, man.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.063
-I was a dick.
-That's cool.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.398
-I'm really sorry.
-No problem, brother.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.608
I feel awful.
You didn't deserve that.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.693
I'm good.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.071
Is it bad?

14:23.113 --> 14:24.656
No, I've seen way worse.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.324
Anyways.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.246
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.998
Did you hear about my behavior?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.291
Well...

14:35.333 --> 14:36.960
I let something small get to me.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.962
I drank a bunch.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.672
I don't remember
what I said at dinner.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.965
-I have to apologize to...
-That seems to be a thing.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.426
-What?
-People not remembering.

14:44.467 --> 14:48.263
I just know that I acted
extremely inappropriate.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.057
-I don't know what to say.
-Well...

14:51.099 --> 14:52.475
I understand if you don't
want me to be here.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.561
Mathew, I mean, honestly,
like, I need to be able

14:54.602 --> 14:56.479
to trust my crew,
and not if they get upset,

14:56.521 --> 14:58.106
walk off the boat.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.150
-I'm not asking...
-I need to come back.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.944
Well, I got a chef.

15:02.986 --> 15:03.987
Sh--.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.196
What have I done?

15:10.285 --> 15:13.413
I need to be able
to trust my crew,

15:13.455 --> 15:15.582
and not if they get upset,
walk off the boat.

15:15.623 --> 15:20.587
And well, I got a chef.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.340
Because I couldn't
not get a chef.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.217
Sh--.
What have I done? I'm here...

15:26.259 --> 15:27.427
For me as a captain,
I have a job to do.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.095
-Right.
-This is not personal.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.597
Understood.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.433
But he isn't out of
quarantine until Tuesday.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.393
-We start charter Monday.
-Right.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.686
So, if you could just
get me through this...

15:36.728 --> 15:38.063
-Understood, yeah.
-I appreciate it.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.314
Yeah.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.732
Well, welcome back,
and thank you.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.359
-Thank you so much.
-I really appreciate you.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.360
So, this next charter
will be it for me?

15:43.401 --> 15:44.569
Yeah.
Yes.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.696
-Yeah. I appreciate...
-Thank you.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.406
You letting me come back for
this last charter.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.033
-Thanks, Mathew.
-Thank you.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.743
Mathew's very unpredictable
at this point.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.162
I just don't wanna have
to walk on eggshells.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.663
So, why don't I just go
with a guarantee...

15:55.705 --> 15:57.123
Someone who really wants
to be here?

15:57.165 --> 15:58.625
Did I hear Mat?

15:58.667 --> 15:59.793
Oh, I know.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.252
I owe you all an apology.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.295
-Are you going?
-Are you back?

16:02.337 --> 16:03.797
I'm gonna do this charter,

16:03.838 --> 16:07.384
and Sandy's hired another
chef for after that.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.802
So, what happened?
Why did you leave?

16:08.843 --> 16:11.513
I was just drunk, over-tired,
empty stomach.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.806
Oh, you have no idea
what went on last night.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.391
-Well...
-Yeah.

16:14.432 --> 16:15.725
I don't want to.
We turned the page in the book.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.268
-Yeah, I agree.
-Let's start today new.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.395
You don't wanna continue
the whole charter?

16:18.436 --> 16:20.063
I would love to,
but you know,

16:20.105 --> 16:21.773
she's replaced me, and
it's understandably so.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.567
Yeah.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.403
-[bleep]
-I know, I'm sorry.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.488
If I said anything inappropriate
or offensive last night...

16:28.530 --> 16:31.616
No, you're fine.
Mat, you're so fine.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.243
-Trust me.
-You're fine.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.577
Yeah.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.581
-Good enough?
-Are you all right?

16:38.623 --> 16:39.624
That'll be fine.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.297
Malia? I'm sorry for
my behavior last night.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.590
Whoa! Hello!

16:47.632 --> 16:49.384
That's okay.
Are you all right?

16:49.426 --> 16:51.261
Emotional roller coaster, but...

16:51.302 --> 16:52.637
Yeah.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.888
So, if I was inappropriate,
my apologies.

16:53.930 --> 16:54.889
I think you just
were a little drunk.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.308
-A little?
-Yeah.

16:58.476 --> 16:59.436
No.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.479
Yeah, I'm pretty hungry.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.898
Yo, Mat!

17:03.940 --> 17:05.734
Katie, I'm sorry.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.277
Hey, man, like, unless you own
your sh--, you know, like...

17:07.318 --> 17:08.319
Yeah, I mean, what can I do?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.113
As long as you're okay...

17:10.155 --> 17:11.698
I can't blame other people
for my mistakes, you know?

17:11.740 --> 17:12.866
As long as you're okay,
that's all that...

17:12.907 --> 17:13.867
-I think you're amazing.
-Aw!

17:13.908 --> 17:15.785
I love working with you.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.704
-Shame about Cheffy.
-I know!

17:17.746 --> 17:19.330
Like, if you're gonna
leave, leave.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.291
Don't keep coming back
and forth, because,

17:21.332 --> 17:22.709
like, we need people
we can count on, you know?

17:22.751 --> 17:24.461
I know.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.755
I hope you're right.
I don't...

17:26.796 --> 17:28.465
like, last night was just...
I don't know.

17:28.506 --> 17:29.674
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.259
I completely agree
with everyone.

17:31.301 --> 17:32.761
Like, I feel, like,
slightly in the middle.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.387
Well, there shouldn't
be a middle.

17:34.429 --> 17:35.847
-Like, we all understand...
-No, no, yeah.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.474
...where she's coming from.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.642
Yeah, hopefully we can
all just move past it.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.227
Move past it.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.605
I've had drunken nights
I regret, trust me.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.899
It's usually not fighting,
it's usually too much loving.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.400
Yeah.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.738
Wes, you and Adam
both kissed me tonight.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.534
Same.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.495
Katie, Malia, Mathew, meet me
in the crew mess

17:58.536 --> 18:00.372
for charter number three
preference sheet meeting.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.831
En route.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.668
Ooh.

18:04.709 --> 18:05.710
Sorry.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.337
So, charter number three...

18:07.379 --> 18:09.589
Athena Lucene is a
success coach from Connecticut.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.424
We could use one of those.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.469
Also joining, brothers
Jackenson and Jivenson

18:14.511 --> 18:16.971
are co-owners of an
online trading firm.

18:17.013 --> 18:20.308
So, Athena organized
an entrepreneur's retreat

18:20.350 --> 18:22.352
to celebrate their success.

18:22.394 --> 18:24.562
Is she offering services?

18:24.604 --> 18:25.980
I'm sure their success
is probably based

18:26.022 --> 18:27.899
off their communication style,

18:27.941 --> 18:30.568
and I guarantee you they all go
through their ups and downs.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.862
It's easy to be really
oh, yeah, we did it,

18:32.904 --> 18:34.698
high fiving when it's up time.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.741
It's when it's down
that you've gotta stay up.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.368
-Yes.
-Mathew.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.662
I know, that is wise advice.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.997
It's not good for
your reputation to get drunk

18:43.039 --> 18:44.833
and quit on a charter yacht.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.418
Even though it's my last trip,

18:46.459 --> 18:48.378
I still just wanna
do the best I can.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.881
Athena's friends Brooke and
Janine will also be joining.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.466
On night two,
group would like two cakes.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.260
Two cakes, all right.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.388
The group would also like green,
gold, black, and white balloons,

18:58.430 --> 19:00.015
and expect five-star service.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.891
-Don't we do that anyway?
-Yeah, normally.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.685
-All right, thank you.
-Thank you.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.395
-Let's do this.
-Let's do it.

19:05.437 --> 19:06.438
Looking good.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.731
This thing stinks.

19:07.772 --> 19:08.815
Mate, do you wanna
just coil that up?

19:08.857 --> 19:09.858
I'll be done in a second.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.443
Okay.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.615
Did you guys get an apology?

19:24.581 --> 19:25.582
I assumed when I came back here
I would be,

19:25.623 --> 19:27.751
like, the only issue.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.961
Yeah, no, you got trumped.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.523
Yeah, I agree.

19:50.565 --> 19:51.941
Yeah, but I'm trying to
figure out what was said

19:51.983 --> 19:53.860
for us to go from hugging
to, like, arguing.

19:53.902 --> 19:56.905
You attacked my character,
you called me names,

19:56.946 --> 20:00.450
you said the other night when
I was talking to you

20:00.492 --> 20:02.577
about your dad that that
was all for my own benefit.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.336
You don't have to be okay.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.466
Oh, he was.
He really was.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.638
-I was being very genuine.
-I just...

20:21.680 --> 20:23.473
You've never asked me about
my family,

20:23.515 --> 20:25.558
so for you to throw that in my
face, that was really sh--ty.

20:27.519 --> 20:28.478
Okay, I was...

20:28.520 --> 20:29.896
You did, last night.

20:29.938 --> 20:30.897
That, like...
anyways, Malia, this is not...

20:30.939 --> 20:32.899
this is not, like...

20:32.941 --> 20:34.109
If you're gonna come in here and
you're gonna disagree with me

20:34.150 --> 20:35.360
about what you were saying,
then...

20:35.402 --> 20:36.361
it's not a genuine apology.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.737
Well, here's the thing.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.073
So, yeah, I have work to do.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.868
-All right.
-Thanks for the apology.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.000
Good.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.001
No more freakouts.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.419
Yeah.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.753
Go in the engine room
and scream,

20:53.795 --> 20:55.130
-that's basically soundproof.
-Yeah.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.007
Just go in there and just go
----ing mental

20:57.048 --> 20:59.551
and be all right,
I feel better now.

20:59.592 --> 21:00.969
-Katie?
-Yeah?

21:01.011 --> 21:02.470
Talk to me.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.974
Mat ----ed up last night,
and today...

21:06.016 --> 21:06.975
-Yeah.
-he was, like, I'm so sorry...

21:07.017 --> 21:08.143
Yeah.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.144
I really apologize
for my actions.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.687
Yeah.

21:10.729 --> 21:11.980
And, like,
she's just gonna, like...

21:12.022 --> 21:13.898
Well, I don't really remember,
so.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.400
She was, like, yeah, I don't
know what you want me to say.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.404
Like, if you were truly sorry
and you wanted to be a team,

21:19.446 --> 21:20.739
like, a member of this team...

21:20.780 --> 21:22.365
Yeah, no I would be
groveling right now.

21:22.407 --> 21:23.575
I was hoping today would
have been a little more...

21:23.616 --> 21:25.535
Yeah.

21:25.577 --> 21:27.454
Are you guys talking, because
I really want a shower.

21:27.495 --> 21:28.538
-Yeah.
-Can we...

21:28.580 --> 21:29.831
Can you give us a minute?

21:29.873 --> 21:30.915
I'll give you
five minutes, yeah.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.843
Mm, whatever.

21:41.885 --> 21:43.053
I know.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.596
----ing charter two.

21:47.015 --> 21:51.061
This whole Lexi situation has
been draining me on every angle.

21:51.102 --> 21:52.437
Are you on the phone?

21:52.479 --> 21:53.980
-No, no, I was messaging.
-Oh.

21:54.022 --> 21:57.067
We don't have a lot of time
to figure this sh-- out.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.527
I don't know what to
do about this.

22:02.906 --> 22:05.700
I did, I generally apologized
at the meeting,

22:05.742 --> 22:07.160
and then she...

22:07.202 --> 22:09.120
I individually spoke to Malia.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.875
And it's, like...
it's BS.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.752
Well, no, she was just
telling me what's happened.

22:15.794 --> 22:17.420
It's not bullsh-- because
you don't know what you did,

22:17.462 --> 22:19.047
this is the problem.

22:19.089 --> 22:21.758
I've already let it go
if nobody's like...

22:21.800 --> 22:23.176
-But not everybody has.
-Well, then...

22:23.218 --> 22:24.928
You've put us in a
really sh--ty situation.

22:24.969 --> 22:27.889
Like, I really like you,
I care about you,

22:27.931 --> 22:29.766
but this is becoming...

22:29.808 --> 22:30.767
Okay.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.143
Do you wanna be here?

22:32.185 --> 22:34.020
I do wanna be here!

22:34.062 --> 22:35.772
So, don't backchat to me when
I speak to you like this.

22:35.814 --> 22:38.441
Your wrong, Malia was wrong,
all of you guys are wrong.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.651
You know what I'm saying?

22:39.693 --> 22:42.028
You ----ed up massively.

22:42.070 --> 22:44.823
Right now, I'm pissed off
with you, again.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.783
Because it doesn't feel
like you want to be here,

22:46.825 --> 22:48.952
it doesn't feel like you care.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.746
So, when this morning
I had your back...

22:51.788 --> 22:53.081
Really?

22:53.123 --> 22:55.125
No, I don't care.
I don't care.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.459
-Okay.
-And so, I'm done.

22:56.501 --> 22:57.961
Bye.

22:58.003 --> 23:00.797
Hey, Mom, I'm, like,
quitting this boat.

23:00.839 --> 23:03.133
This... because I can't
deal with this.

23:09.681 --> 23:10.724
Right now, I'm pissed off
with you, again.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.853
Because it doesn't feel
like you want to be here,

23:14.894 --> 23:17.022
it doesn't feel like you care...

23:17.063 --> 23:18.314
Really?

23:18.356 --> 23:19.858
No, I don't care.
I'm leaving.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.192
Like, this is unprofessional.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.111
I don't wanna do it,
and so I'm done.

23:23.153 --> 23:25.321
Hey, Mom, I'm, like,
quitting this boat.

23:25.363 --> 23:26.948
This... because I
can't deal with this.

23:28.116 --> 23:30.076
I'm not a child here.

23:30.118 --> 23:33.580
I'm not gonna be spoken to from
someone that's unprofessional.

23:39.836 --> 23:42.255
Mummy! Mummy!

23:54.893 --> 23:56.603
No, he's not pleased with me,

23:56.644 --> 23:59.731
but that's why you pray,
and you ask for forgiveness.

24:02.776 --> 24:03.943
All right, bye, I love you.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.876
Tits up again, is it?

24:19.918 --> 24:21.211
I just...
she was in the galley.

24:21.252 --> 24:23.213
-What's happening?
-Lexi.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.884
We've still got a job to do
at the end of the day.

24:27.926 --> 24:30.011
As long as she cracks
on with her job...

24:30.053 --> 24:31.096
Yeah.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.931
It's all Gucci.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.766
Yeah.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.815
It's hard to defend somebody
when they're in the wrong.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.903
What do I do, go speak to Sandy?

24:46.945 --> 24:49.197
Yeah.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.657
-Hey, buddy.
-What's up?

24:54.035 --> 24:56.121
Oh ----ing drama.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.093
Ugh.

25:18.476 --> 25:19.811
You won't [bleep] up!

25:21.271 --> 25:22.939
Yeah, I know.

25:22.981 --> 25:24.399
You guys are great.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.859
Cheers.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.820
-Ugh.
-Morning.

25:28.862 --> 25:29.821
How's it going?

25:29.863 --> 25:30.905
Dave, are you making tea?

25:30.947 --> 25:31.906
Yeah, you want?

25:31.948 --> 25:33.116
Can I have a coffee, please?

25:33.158 --> 25:36.119
-Z?
-Actually, a coffee, please.

25:36.161 --> 25:38.830
-Morning.
-Morning.

25:38.872 --> 25:40.457
This is one of those
challenges in yachting

25:40.498 --> 25:43.460
where you have to figure
a way to come back from it.

25:43.501 --> 25:46.046
And I think for Lexi,
unfortunately, like,

25:46.087 --> 25:48.423
you piss off that
many crew members,

25:48.465 --> 25:52.344
like, it's gonna be rough.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.887
I've got a list.
I'll bring it down.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.305
It's in the bridge
deck pantry.

25:55.347 --> 25:56.848
All right, we've got
a lot to get done.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.184
You need to wipe all
the flats and stainless.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.185
Let's go!
Woo!

26:00.226 --> 26:01.811
Sweet.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.273
Captain Sandy?

26:05.315 --> 26:06.483
-Uh-huh?
-Can I speak to you?

26:06.524 --> 26:07.734
-Yeah.
-Good morning.

26:07.776 --> 26:09.444
Good morning.

26:09.486 --> 26:12.030
So, how are you?

26:12.072 --> 26:14.908
I'm just concerned about,
like, the whole boat,

26:14.949 --> 26:17.744
and just maybe this isn't the
right environment for her.

26:17.786 --> 26:21.915
I'm just gonna ask you
to give her another chance.

26:21.956 --> 26:23.249
Will you do that?

26:23.291 --> 26:26.169
Just reset with her?

26:26.211 --> 26:28.213
I mean, I'll try,
but in all honesty,

26:28.254 --> 26:31.341
it's more like my concern now
is the whole boat.

26:31.383 --> 26:32.967
It's not just me.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.177
Well, you have to
worry about your department,

26:34.219 --> 26:35.220
not the whole boat, okay?

26:35.261 --> 26:36.513
Yeah.

26:36.554 --> 26:39.516
-You're a leader... rise.
-Yeah.

26:39.557 --> 26:43.395
And take this individual
and change her trajectory.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.063
I know she's been horrible.

26:45.105 --> 26:46.856
She apologized
during the meeting.

26:46.898 --> 26:48.066
Yeah.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.317
It's easy to dismiss people.

26:49.359 --> 26:50.443
And you know what's hard?

26:50.485 --> 26:52.320
Investing.
Invest in her.

26:52.362 --> 26:57.283
And if it doesn't work for you,
I promise you I will let her go.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.326
Go lead.

26:58.368 --> 27:01.121
Mm.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.831
Thanks.
You got this.

27:02.872 --> 27:04.332
-Thank you, Captain Sandy.
-You're welcome.

27:04.374 --> 27:07.419
I understand
Sandy's perspective.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.254
It's really pushing me
as a leader,

27:09.295 --> 27:12.173
even though I'm still
angry and upset.

27:12.215 --> 27:14.134
I feel like I need to
be responsible for my team,

27:14.175 --> 27:15.927
and unfortunately,
sometimes it's doing things

27:15.969 --> 27:17.303
you don't wanna ----ing do.

27:21.391 --> 27:22.475
Are the windows the last thing?

27:22.517 --> 27:23.810
-Yeah.
-Nice.

27:23.852 --> 27:26.438
Looks good.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.897
Hello.

27:27.939 --> 27:29.816
I just can't wait
to hear your--

27:29.858 --> 27:31.901
So you can go into Malia's
cabin, and I'll share with her,

27:31.943 --> 27:34.320
because I'm not putting you in
that situation, that's unfair.

27:35.989 --> 27:37.198
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.199
Secret, secrets are no fun.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.909
Well, like...

27:39.951 --> 27:42.078
Like, no one wants to be
with her, but I'll just...

27:42.120 --> 27:43.121
I'll do it.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.958
Obviously, Katie's a
really good manager, and,

27:47.000 --> 27:48.543
like, she's taking one
for the team.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.545
Like, she was calling
herself Satan last night,

27:50.587 --> 27:51.963
so I don't really
know anyone that wants

27:52.005 --> 27:53.340
to be roomies with Satan.

27:57.010 --> 27:59.137
All crew, all crew,
provisioning on the dock.

27:59.179 --> 28:00.305
All right, we gotta do
provisions.

28:00.347 --> 28:02.182
-Copy.
-Courtney's gonna swap.

28:02.223 --> 28:03.350
She's gonna move in here;
you're gonna move in there.

28:03.391 --> 28:05.852
Okay.

28:05.894 --> 28:07.562
Court's gonna move
into your cabin,

28:07.604 --> 28:10.357
because someone's gotta
do it, right?

28:10.398 --> 28:12.233
-Hi, roomie!
-Hi!

28:14.611 --> 28:16.321
Hey, Lex, let's chat quickly.

28:16.363 --> 28:19.157
I thought you quit.

28:19.199 --> 28:23.870
So, in terms of, like,
ethics and morals,

28:23.912 --> 28:26.164
you've really pushed
my boundaries in that.

28:26.206 --> 28:27.999
You called me
a [bleep] to my face.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.459
It won't happen again.

28:29.501 --> 28:31.419
Like, I'm not blaming it
on alcohol, but, like,

28:31.461 --> 28:33.254
every one of us had
so much alcohol,

28:33.296 --> 28:35.298
and it was just you're not
in the right headspace to,

28:35.340 --> 28:37.133
-like, say what you...
-Totally.

28:37.175 --> 28:39.219
What you shouldn't say.
So, I apologize for that.

28:39.260 --> 28:42.013
Yeah, I don't think things
are gonna be perfect,

28:42.055 --> 28:44.015
-or how they were, you know?
-Yeah.

28:44.057 --> 28:45.517
I know I raised my voice
at you the other night,

28:45.558 --> 28:47.227
and I apologize for that.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.020
These things take time, right?

28:49.062 --> 28:50.146
Yeah, I agree.

28:50.188 --> 28:52.607
So, I'm gonna give you a hug.

28:52.649 --> 28:55.318
Thanks.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.237
Trust me, like, it was
just one bad night,

28:57.278 --> 28:59.072
and I don't want the crew
to, like, hate me.

28:59.114 --> 29:01.491
Taking some of Captain
Sandy's advice, it's just,

29:01.533 --> 29:05.078
like, relax a bit before you
make, like, harsh decisions.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.038
So, yeah, I've, like,
mellowed out,

29:07.080 --> 29:08.039
and I was like okay,
I'm gonna stay.

29:08.081 --> 29:09.666
I know I'm a good stew.

29:09.708 --> 29:11.626
I'm just gonna finish it,
repair what I have to do,

29:11.668 --> 29:13.461
and, like, make
this charter season work.

29:13.503 --> 29:16.381
Okay.
Charter number three.

29:16.423 --> 29:19.009
Charter number three,
on the way.

29:19.050 --> 29:21.344
All crew, all crew,
30 minutes until guest arrival.

29:21.386 --> 29:23.054
<i>Copy.</i>

29:23.096 --> 29:24.139
<i>Interior, do you guys</i>
<i>wanna get changed</i>

29:24.180 --> 29:25.974
<i>and quickly sort your cabins?</i>

29:26.016 --> 29:27.517
I obviously need to move all
our sh-- as well.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.019
Yeah.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.938
Just want you wanna
do on pick-up day.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.483
Perfect.

29:35.525 --> 29:37.360
That's good,
it looks good in here.

29:37.402 --> 29:39.696
Okay, sweet, guys.
We got 20 minutes.

29:39.738 --> 29:41.489
Hurrah.

29:46.411 --> 29:49.247
Okay, going out,
do you wanna do the bow?

29:49.289 --> 29:50.457
Yeah, can do.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.334
-You're on the stern?
-Yeah.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.210
Coming off the stern, you know,
it's just pulling lines in.

29:54.252 --> 29:55.420
Yeah.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.172
And then fenders first,
lines after.

29:57.213 --> 29:59.382
All crew, all crew,
please proceed to the dock.

30:01.384 --> 30:03.345
-Is everybody here?
-Yeah.

30:03.386 --> 30:05.430
All right, everyone,
a lot's been going on.

30:05.472 --> 30:07.390
What I want is for
everybody

30:07.432 --> 30:10.977
to set aside the conflict
and focus on the job.

30:11.019 --> 30:13.313
We got this.

30:13.355 --> 30:14.481
-Lexi?
-Yes.

30:14.522 --> 30:16.441
-I believe in you.
-Thank you.

30:16.483 --> 30:17.525
Okay.

30:17.567 --> 30:19.736
Thank you all.

30:19.778 --> 30:22.447
Oh, my gosh, they look
so... in their uniforms.

30:24.157 --> 30:25.408
Coming up...

30:25.450 --> 30:27.243
She wants calamari,
which is squid,

30:27.285 --> 30:29.954
but so she wants it fried,
but they want options,

30:29.996 --> 30:32.624
and she wants it Croatian style,
but not true Croatian,

30:32.665 --> 30:34.668
and she doesn't want me
to tell her what it is,

30:34.709 --> 30:36.127
and she wants to be surprised,

30:36.169 --> 30:37.295
but she wants
me to have a backup,

30:37.337 --> 30:39.589
but call it calamari,
not squid.

30:47.430 --> 30:47.806
We got this.

30:49.641 --> 30:53.395
-Hey!
-Woo!

30:53.436 --> 30:54.771
Welcome!

30:54.813 --> 30:56.189
Hey, Athena Lucene,
very nice to meet you.

30:56.231 --> 30:57.524
And you.

30:57.565 --> 30:59.234
This is Jackpot, the owner
of Fx Capital

30:59.275 --> 31:02.821
with Zo and Jiv, and this
is their management staff.

31:02.862 --> 31:04.614
-Jack, Alonzo.
-Hi.

31:04.656 --> 31:06.282
-Hi, Katie.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

31:06.324 --> 31:07.367
-Hi, Courtney, nice to meet you.
-Very nice to meet you.

31:07.409 --> 31:09.369
-Nice to meet you.
-Mzi.

31:09.411 --> 31:10.829
We're really happy to have you.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.539
We're gonna head out
for your dream charter.

31:12.580 --> 31:16.376
-Croatia!
-Woo!

31:16.418 --> 31:18.378
I think with the crew
morale where it is,

31:18.420 --> 31:20.338
this is what we need
to get them back on track,

31:20.380 --> 31:21.589
is excited guests.

31:21.631 --> 31:23.758
Lady Athena.
[laughs]

31:23.800 --> 31:25.552
Now I just need excited crew.

31:25.593 --> 31:27.095
Woo!

31:27.137 --> 31:28.513
Best day ever?

31:28.555 --> 31:30.557
Welcome on board
Lady Michelle, guys.

31:30.598 --> 31:32.058
Thank you!

31:32.100 --> 31:33.268
-How are you guys feeling?
-Wonderful!

31:33.309 --> 31:35.437
-Great.
-Cheers!

31:35.478 --> 31:37.313
We're here celebrating
your success.

31:37.355 --> 31:39.232
Shall we start this tour?

31:39.274 --> 31:40.817
Yes, let's do it.

31:40.859 --> 31:42.360
So, we'll go straight
up to the sundeck.

31:42.402 --> 31:43.570
-Wow.
-Beautiful.

31:43.611 --> 31:44.571
-How are you guys feeling?
-Great.

31:44.612 --> 31:46.281
Great, definitely a vibe.

31:46.322 --> 31:49.659
There is not
a little bit of luggage.

31:49.701 --> 31:52.245
Our first cabin,
which is the VIP cabin.

31:52.287 --> 31:53.663
This is beautiful.

31:58.209 --> 31:59.419
Now, the primary cabin.

31:59.461 --> 32:00.712
Are you ready?

32:00.754 --> 32:02.505
This is your room,
for the three kings.

32:02.547 --> 32:04.424
-Mm, wow.
-This is your suite.

32:04.466 --> 32:05.592
Amazing!

32:05.633 --> 32:07.844
Oh, they got the robe!

32:07.886 --> 32:09.596
Have I taken care of you guys?

32:09.637 --> 32:11.348
Happy?
Okay, good.

32:11.389 --> 32:12.807
Oh, I got the slippers.

32:12.849 --> 32:15.477
All crew, all crew,
we are ready for departure.

32:15.518 --> 32:18.813
Yes, we are singled up on
the bow and on the stern.

32:18.855 --> 32:21.191
All right, you can drop
the port ground line.

32:21.232 --> 32:22.692
<i>Malia, you can start</i>
<i>freeing up the stern.</i>

32:22.734 --> 32:25.403
Copy, port spring
is coming aboard now.

32:25.445 --> 32:26.905
Let's go, that one.

32:26.946 --> 32:28.698
I'm very proud of my deck crew.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.117
That's it, David.
Fast.

32:31.159 --> 32:33.119
They keep lifting each other up,

32:33.161 --> 32:34.829
and they've come a long way
with, like, their skill sets,

32:34.871 --> 32:36.539
and that's what
I want in my team.

32:36.581 --> 32:38.625
All bow lines on board
and clear.

32:38.667 --> 32:40.794
Stern springs are in,
we're coming off the dock.

32:40.835 --> 32:44.255
Ten feet, midships to dolphin.
Clear off your stern.

32:44.297 --> 32:45.757
-Wow.
-Hi!

32:45.799 --> 32:48.468
Thanks, Malia.
Nice job, everyone.

32:48.510 --> 32:50.762
All right, guys,
let's quickly get changed.

32:50.804 --> 32:53.682
Living our best life in
this big-ass yacht.

32:53.723 --> 32:56.476
So, everyone's making their
way up to the sundeck.

32:56.518 --> 32:58.436
-Perfect, thank you.
-Thank you.

33:01.398 --> 33:02.732
-So, we're gonna take off...
-Yes.

33:02.774 --> 33:04.192
-And get some lunch.
-Yes.

33:06.528 --> 33:09.322
Sure.

33:09.364 --> 33:11.157
Deck crew, 10 minutes to anchor.

33:11.199 --> 33:12.200
Copy.

33:12.242 --> 33:13.201
Can I top off your champagne?

33:13.243 --> 33:14.327
Yes, please, Lex.

33:14.369 --> 33:15.912
-Lexi.
-Lexi is on point.

33:15.954 --> 33:17.622
Anything Katie asks me to do,

33:17.664 --> 33:19.332
I can do, because I know
I'm a good worker.

33:19.374 --> 33:21.835
Plus, like, you're
so busy focusing on guests,

33:21.876 --> 33:23.378
you don't have time to be angry.

33:23.420 --> 33:25.588
So, that's, like,
my thought process, is,

33:25.630 --> 33:27.424
like, okay, that was
yesterday, let it go.

33:27.465 --> 33:29.509
You're not quitting,
finish the season.

33:29.551 --> 33:31.511
-Thank you, Lexi.
-My pleasure.

33:31.553 --> 33:32.679
-Oh, God.
-What's the matter?

33:32.721 --> 33:34.347
I just know it's gonna be...

33:34.389 --> 33:35.515
Yeah.

33:35.557 --> 33:36.641
Who do you want up
for the anchor?

33:36.683 --> 33:38.351
Whoever, just need two of you.

33:45.734 --> 33:46.693
Do you wanna drop again, Z?

33:46.735 --> 33:48.194
Yeah.

33:48.236 --> 33:49.195
So, if I leave you two,
that's good?

33:49.237 --> 33:50.780
-Yeah.
-Okay.

33:50.822 --> 33:52.407
How's it going?

33:53.575 --> 33:54.909
Good.

34:00.582 --> 34:02.542
Oh, fantastic.

34:02.584 --> 34:04.002
Once again, I'm back in laundry,

34:04.044 --> 34:05.879
even though I had
my little taste of service.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.422
I mean, it's fine,
because obviously

34:07.464 --> 34:08.882
it's like the
whole rotation thing.

34:08.923 --> 34:10.383
But it's more just
annoying because it is

34:10.425 --> 34:12.260
Lexi that's on service,
after, like,

34:12.302 --> 34:14.429
everything that she's kind
of put the crew through now.

34:14.471 --> 34:15.889
And then I have to swap
cabins as well,

34:15.930 --> 34:17.724
just before a trip,
and it's not even, like,

34:17.766 --> 34:20.310
my fault the reason why
I'm ----ing switching.

34:20.352 --> 34:22.729
So, it's pretty sh--ty.

34:22.771 --> 34:24.731
And then as soon as cap
calls it...

34:24.773 --> 34:25.857
Then I'll drop down.

34:25.899 --> 34:27.650
How many minutes, you reckon?

34:27.692 --> 34:28.693
For lunch?

34:28.735 --> 34:29.903
Yeah...
sooner the better?

34:29.944 --> 34:31.404
-Yes.
-You can drop the anchor.

34:31.446 --> 34:32.572
<i>Copy that, dropping anchor.</i>

34:35.033 --> 34:37.619
Captain Sandy, Dave, three in
the water, very short stay.

34:37.660 --> 34:38.745
Okay, we're all set, thank you.

34:38.787 --> 34:40.372
Happy with the deck crew?

34:40.413 --> 34:41.539
Yeah, very happy.

34:41.581 --> 34:43.708
Good mood on the boat?

34:43.750 --> 34:46.419
Uh, I haven't been inside, but
on deck, it is, yeah, fo' sho'.

34:46.461 --> 34:48.380
Good.

34:48.421 --> 34:50.006
Yep, let's go, toy setup.

34:50.048 --> 34:52.634
All right,
that's all ----ed.

34:57.639 --> 34:58.765
How's it going?

34:58.807 --> 35:00.433
Katie said they're very nice,

35:00.475 --> 35:01.685
but she thinks they'll
be a little demanding.

35:01.726 --> 35:02.977
That's okay, though.

35:03.019 --> 35:03.978
That's what we're
here for, right?

35:04.020 --> 35:05.605
Yeah.

35:05.647 --> 35:07.482
Going into this charter,
I'm trying to get back

35:07.524 --> 35:08.608
in everyone's good graces,
just to feel good about myself

35:08.650 --> 35:10.443
about finishing on a high note,

35:10.485 --> 35:15.281
even though, like,
I messed up and I'm leaving.

35:15.323 --> 35:16.491
We'll see how
the first lunch goes.

35:16.533 --> 35:17.659
That's the tone-setter.

35:17.701 --> 35:18.660
Can you say a little prayer?

35:18.702 --> 35:19.953
Oh, yeah.

35:19.994 --> 35:21.705
Do you still wanna
wait for everybody?

35:21.746 --> 35:23.623
You know what I'm gonna do,
let me gather them.

35:23.665 --> 35:24.874
Yeah.

35:24.916 --> 35:25.875
-Lloyd?
-Yeah.

35:25.917 --> 35:26.876
You got it?

35:26.918 --> 35:27.877
Come on out.

35:27.919 --> 35:28.878
Greek salad?

35:28.920 --> 35:30.505
Yep, deconstructed, like a Cobb.

35:30.547 --> 35:32.757
And then I'll be
plating proteins right now.

35:35.677 --> 35:37.345
Lexi, what's for lunch,
do you know?

35:37.387 --> 35:39.723
He's, like, probably doing,
like, a Croatian salad.

35:39.764 --> 35:40.974
Yeah, there we go, perfect.

35:41.016 --> 35:42.642
Breaded fried chicken,

35:42.684 --> 35:45.311
and then on the side we
have some chimichurri shrimp.

35:45.353 --> 35:46.730
Chimichurri.

35:46.771 --> 35:48.481
Looking Gucci.

35:48.523 --> 35:49.607
Okay, I'm gonna kick you off
on service with me.

35:49.649 --> 35:51.067
-Uh-huh.
-Moment of truth.

35:51.109 --> 35:52.360
Let's see.

35:54.154 --> 35:56.656
Uh-oh. Uh-oh!

35:56.698 --> 35:59.117
Mm!

35:59.159 --> 36:00.410
Yeah.

36:00.452 --> 36:01.619
That's the answer, right there.

36:01.661 --> 36:03.121
That's right, delicious.

36:03.163 --> 36:05.498
-You didn't say anything.
-Magnifique.

36:05.540 --> 36:06.833
Are we putting the slide up?

36:06.875 --> 36:08.001
Sure are.

36:08.043 --> 36:09.127
Piña colada.

36:11.796 --> 36:13.840
How is your lunch?

36:13.882 --> 36:16.092
Oh, Captain Sandy!

36:16.134 --> 36:17.677
Everything is so divine.

36:17.719 --> 36:19.429
-I'm so happy.
-It's amazing, yeah.

36:19.471 --> 36:20.680
Thank you, Captain Sandy.

36:20.722 --> 36:22.015
All right, you know
where I am...

36:22.057 --> 36:23.016
-Thank you, yes, we do.
-If you need anything.

36:23.058 --> 36:24.017
-Okay.
-Thank you.

36:24.059 --> 36:25.352
-Thank you.
-Okay.

36:25.393 --> 36:26.519
-Ooh!
-How you doing, Lexi?

36:26.561 --> 36:27.520
-I'm good, how are you?
-Good.

36:27.562 --> 36:28.521
That's good.

36:28.563 --> 36:29.689
Glad to have you with us.

36:29.731 --> 36:30.690
-I know.
-You ready?

36:30.732 --> 36:31.775
-Yeah.
-Ready? Ready?

36:31.816 --> 36:33.526
Yes, I'm ready.

36:33.568 --> 36:34.527
We'll just hold off
all the tequila from now on

36:34.569 --> 36:35.820
for all of us.

36:35.862 --> 36:36.946
I know, no drinking for me,
I promise.

36:36.988 --> 36:37.947
For all of us.

36:37.989 --> 36:39.866
I've been there.

36:39.908 --> 36:41.785
I wouldn't want someone to judge
me because of one bad night.

36:47.916 --> 36:48.875
Have you ridden these before?

36:48.917 --> 36:49.876
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

36:49.918 --> 36:51.002
All right, let go!

36:52.712 --> 36:54.047
Ah!

36:55.090 --> 36:56.508
Ha ha!

37:04.182 --> 37:06.726
Ah!

37:06.768 --> 37:09.562
I got a mouthful of soap!

37:09.604 --> 37:10.563
-Hi.
-Hi.

37:10.605 --> 37:12.649
Oh, it smells so divine in here.

37:12.691 --> 37:14.442
Thank you.

37:14.484 --> 37:16.820
I spoke to my clients, and I
know I mentioned squid earlier.

37:16.861 --> 37:18.613
Yes.

37:18.655 --> 37:20.073
But then when I touched base
with them again about that,

37:20.115 --> 37:22.492
they're like, mm, not
so much with the squid.

37:22.534 --> 37:23.827
-No one wants squid?
-Okay.

37:23.868 --> 37:25.662
So, other options, too,
because some of them

37:25.704 --> 37:27.080
are really open to the squid,
and some are not.

37:27.122 --> 37:28.081
Okay.

37:28.123 --> 37:29.708
Are you guys all good up here?

37:29.749 --> 37:30.709
Yeah, thank you.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.127
I could do calamari-style squid,

37:32.168 --> 37:34.504
or I could do seared scallops
as an option?

37:34.546 --> 37:36.506
Basically just give us
some options

37:36.548 --> 37:38.466
for the persons who
don't want the squid.

37:38.508 --> 37:40.802
I love calamari, but
just the circle parts.

37:40.844 --> 37:43.847
-Let's do a little bit of both.
-Okay.

37:43.888 --> 37:47.100
And mix maybe a little bit
of the Croatian cuisine.

37:47.142 --> 37:48.810
Right.

37:48.852 --> 37:50.562
But just kinda, like,
a little bit of everything.

37:50.603 --> 37:53.064
So, I was going to do
polenta with tomato sauce

37:53.106 --> 37:54.190
and, like, calamari...

37:54.232 --> 37:55.191
-Surprise me.
-Okay, great.

37:55.233 --> 37:56.609
-Thank you.
-Okay.

37:56.651 --> 37:58.111
-Okay, thanks, Mathew.
-Thank you.

37:58.153 --> 37:59.821
What the [bleep] was that?

37:59.863 --> 38:01.531
How am I supposed to give
this woman what she wants

38:08.705 --> 38:09.831
So, I was going to do
polenta with calamari...

38:10.874 --> 38:12.167
Surprise me.

38:12.208 --> 38:14.210
I'm thinking dinner
at about 8:30.

38:14.252 --> 38:15.211
8:30, okay.

38:15.253 --> 38:16.212
Okay, thanks, Mathew.

38:16.254 --> 38:17.714
Thank you.

38:17.756 --> 38:20.633
This is a sh-- storm,
and I'm nervous.

38:20.675 --> 38:21.760
Hey.

38:21.801 --> 38:23.136
So yeah, what's happened?

38:24.763 --> 38:26.139
Yes, sir.

38:26.181 --> 38:29.142
That conversation
was so all over the place,

38:29.184 --> 38:30.852
and left me with no guidance.

38:30.894 --> 38:32.062
Oh, yeah?

38:32.103 --> 38:33.730
She wants calamari,
which is squid,

38:33.772 --> 38:36.649
but so she wants it fried,
but they want options,

38:36.691 --> 38:38.109
and she wants it Croatian style,

38:38.151 --> 38:40.195
but not true Croatian,
and she doesn't want me

38:40.236 --> 38:41.946
to tell her what it is,
and she wants to be surprised,

38:41.988 --> 38:43.198
but she wants me
to have a backup.

38:43.239 --> 38:44.324
She's, like... she...

38:44.366 --> 38:47.035
But call it calamari, not squid.

38:47.077 --> 38:49.204
I'm just laughing
to keep from crying.

38:49.245 --> 38:52.165
Z! Ah!

38:52.207 --> 38:54.084
Deck crew, let's get changed
into our blacks, please.

38:56.753 --> 38:57.712
Are we all good?
Can I get anybody anything else?

38:57.754 --> 38:59.589
-We are awesome.
-Awesome.

38:59.631 --> 39:01.216
-How is she doing?
-She's fine.

39:01.257 --> 39:03.218
It's just, like,
my morals are completely...

39:03.259 --> 39:05.970
-Yeah.
-You know?

39:06.012 --> 39:07.639
Lexi, do you wanna
eat something quickly?

39:07.681 --> 39:09.224
Oh, I already ate,
I just didn't change.

39:09.265 --> 39:11.101
-Do you wanna get changed?
-Yeah, I'll go change.

39:14.396 --> 39:16.022
Wow.

39:16.064 --> 39:17.107
I feel like my camera
doesn't do anything.

39:18.650 --> 39:20.735
We've Dave overboard
doing the slide.

39:20.777 --> 39:22.028
Okay, coming up.

39:22.070 --> 39:23.113
-I want a shower.
-I need a shower.

39:23.154 --> 39:25.323
-Yeah.
-Okay.

39:25.365 --> 39:26.324
Yeah, boy.

39:26.366 --> 39:27.909
So much better.

39:27.951 --> 39:30.662
I'm gonna do polenta,
then crispy squid,

39:30.704 --> 39:34.040
fish with black rice,
and then this lamb pica.

39:34.082 --> 39:35.250
I can't stress about it, right?

39:35.291 --> 39:36.251
Okay.

39:36.292 --> 39:37.711
Is the slide in?

39:37.752 --> 39:38.712
Yeah, we got a new way
of doing it.

39:38.753 --> 39:39.796
Dang!

39:43.258 --> 39:45.010
There you go.

39:45.051 --> 39:48.638
Any chance I get to bring
in some engineering experience

39:48.680 --> 39:50.724
to make my life easier,
I'm gonna use it.

39:50.765 --> 39:52.934
When I'm looking at something,
I'll break it up and think,

39:52.976 --> 39:55.770
well, can I move that here,
do that there, is that...

39:55.812 --> 39:58.106
you know, can I change
the order of what I'm doing.

39:58.148 --> 39:59.399
And then afterwards,
you've managed

39:59.441 --> 40:00.608
to solve a problem
that other people

40:00.650 --> 40:02.235
may have been struggling with.

40:02.277 --> 40:05.196
As time goes on, I feel much
more comfortable in my role,

40:05.238 --> 40:07.240
as well as my place
within the team.

40:08.366 --> 40:09.701
Okay, tension.

40:09.743 --> 40:11.119
Coming up.

40:11.161 --> 40:12.162
Okay, I'm just gonna
start setting dinner.

40:12.203 --> 40:13.163
I'll pull the glasses.

40:13.204 --> 40:14.748
Thanks, honey.

40:14.789 --> 40:15.874
We're doing water,
whites, and reds?

40:15.915 --> 40:16.958
Yeah.

40:32.182 --> 40:34.142
I grew up really religious.

40:34.184 --> 40:36.978
It's Pentecostal,
so in my religion,

40:37.020 --> 40:39.397
you're supposed
to be kind and loving,

40:39.439 --> 40:41.399
even towards people
that have done you wrong.

40:41.441 --> 40:42.400
I'm gonna put some
stuff on the end.

40:42.442 --> 40:44.361
Oh, okay.

40:44.402 --> 40:47.822
I struggle with loving people
after they've really crossed me.

40:47.864 --> 40:50.325
With Katie,
we're getting the job done.

40:50.367 --> 40:51.951
That's all I'm trying to do.

40:51.993 --> 40:53.870
Are these battery...
oh, that's so cool.

40:53.912 --> 40:55.288
Yeah, these are really
cool fairy lights.

40:55.330 --> 40:56.956
I have to say,
the tables have been elegant.

40:56.998 --> 40:58.375
Yeah, that's gorg.

41:00.043 --> 41:01.294
Five minutes.

41:03.046 --> 41:04.339
-Courtney.
-Hi. How's it going?

41:04.381 --> 41:06.132
I'm so glad the cabin's
finally sorted.

41:06.174 --> 41:07.467
I just went in and made my bed.

41:07.509 --> 41:08.468
Yeah, I can't believe
that happened

41:08.510 --> 41:09.969
-right before...
-I know.

41:10.011 --> 41:11.888
I'm very excited
to room with Courtney.

41:11.930 --> 41:13.264
I feel bad for Katie.

41:13.306 --> 41:15.183
I think she's taking
one for the team.

41:15.225 --> 41:18.895
Now she has to deal
with the burn list.

41:18.937 --> 41:21.022
So elegant, isn't it?

41:21.064 --> 41:22.774
Would you guys like to
head to the table?

41:22.816 --> 41:24.776
-Yeah, let's do it.
-Yes, please.

41:28.738 --> 41:30.407
Look, everyone here.

41:30.448 --> 41:32.158
What's taking y'all?

41:34.494 --> 41:36.454
Can we start bringing
the food out?

41:36.496 --> 41:37.872
Yeah, sure.

41:37.914 --> 41:39.332
Yeah.

41:39.374 --> 41:41.167
So, I guess we we're going
ahead with dinner.

41:43.294 --> 41:44.921
You're so clean and organized.

41:44.963 --> 41:46.798
I try to be.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.216
[phone rings]

41:48.258 --> 41:50.760
I just know...
nah, we'll see how it goes.

41:50.802 --> 41:52.053
Galley.

41:52.095 --> 41:54.014
She said to start
bringing the food.

41:54.055 --> 41:55.265
I'm like, no one's at the
table, no one's got drinks,

41:55.306 --> 41:57.434
but so just be
a right ----ing mess.

41:59.894 --> 42:01.187
Yes.

42:01.229 --> 42:02.856
So weird.

42:02.897 --> 42:06.943
I think Sandy sees how
difficult this charter is.

42:06.985 --> 42:09.320
And the fact that
I'm dealing with it,

42:09.362 --> 42:13.199
knowing I'm going to leave,
helps her respect me more.

42:13.241 --> 42:16.286
That I can just roll with
the punches and make them happy.

42:16.327 --> 42:17.912
Smells really good.

42:17.954 --> 42:19.456
Can we start bringing
out the dinner?

42:19.497 --> 42:21.374
Yeah, it'll come out shortly.

42:21.416 --> 42:22.417
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

42:22.459 --> 42:24.002
Okay.

42:24.044 --> 42:25.170
Katie, Katie, galley.
You wanna come down?

42:25.211 --> 42:26.504
-I'm plating.
-Copy that.

42:26.546 --> 42:28.340
The primary keeps asking
for her food, so...

42:28.381 --> 42:30.133
Yep, we're going.

42:30.175 --> 42:35.096
Lex, call Courtney and tell her
we will need her for plates.

42:35.138 --> 42:36.097
Okay.

42:36.139 --> 42:38.058
I'm ready to eat.

42:38.099 --> 42:40.060
When I don't eat, I lose my
hunger, then later, I can't eat.

42:40.101 --> 42:42.937
All right, let me check, because
I don't think the food is ready.

42:42.979 --> 42:44.105
Man. I'm ready to grub.

42:44.147 --> 42:45.815
For real, bro.

42:45.857 --> 42:47.442
No one's got drinks,
now she's probably like,

42:47.484 --> 42:48.943
where is everyone?

42:48.985 --> 42:51.154
-Hello?
-Hello.

42:51.196 --> 42:52.947
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:52.989 --> 42:54.324
We're running
a little bit behind.

42:54.366 --> 42:55.950
Sorry, we're just
bringing up the food.

42:55.992 --> 42:58.495
And we're already
having a late dinner.

42:58.536 --> 43:01.581
Yeah, we're...
the chef is just plating it now.

43:01.623 --> 43:04.125
The way I do service is
you wait for all the guests

43:04.167 --> 43:06.044
to come to the table,
you start your waters,

43:06.086 --> 43:07.962
your wines, your breads,
whatever.

43:08.004 --> 43:09.172
I'm more than happy
to do whatever you want.

43:09.214 --> 43:10.965
Like, it's your charter.

43:11.007 --> 43:13.385
But don't come running down
and making me look bad

43:13.426 --> 43:14.928
or that I'm not doing my job,

43:14.969 --> 43:16.429
because that's not
the case at all.

43:16.471 --> 43:19.933
-Okay.
-I'll be with you in a moment.

43:19.974 --> 43:21.601
What is she saying?

43:21.643 --> 43:23.353
That we're running behind.

43:26.106 --> 43:27.065
All right, let's just do it.

43:27.107 --> 43:28.191
They're bringing it up.

43:28.233 --> 43:29.984
Yeah, because I'm hungry now.

43:32.404 --> 43:34.280
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:34.322 --> 43:36.116
I'm sick of people quitting and
then being able to come back.

43:36.157 --> 43:38.952
Just because you've caused
drama and nearly got fired

43:38.993 --> 43:40.578
doesn't mean now that you
should have special treatment.

43:45.917 --> 43:47.544
She's the kind of girl
that I could see myself

43:47.585 --> 43:49.921
being closer to.

43:54.259 --> 43:55.385
I came for a sneak peek
of the cake.

43:55.427 --> 43:57.303
I have one here.

43:57.345 --> 43:59.222
-Mm.
-And the other one's vanilla.

43:59.264 --> 44:02.100
Uh, I'm disappointed.

44:02.142 --> 44:04.185
It's been an
interesting evening, huh?

44:06.438 --> 44:08.606
Mat, come to the bridge, please.

44:08.648 --> 44:10.984
I've done everything
I can to redeem myself,

44:11.026 --> 44:13.069
but sh--, this is it.

44:13.111 --> 44:14.904
Hey.
