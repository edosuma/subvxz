<i>As the clues pile up.</i>

00:19.787 --> 00:20.452
[Buck] What you got, Bill?

00:20.454 --> 00:21.787
It's gotten bigger.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.556
[narrator]
<i>In the hunt for Bigfoot.</i>

00:24.558 --> 00:26.492
This looks like
Bigfoot's sign to me.

00:26.494 --> 00:30.429
We're coming after him and
by God we're gonna catch him.

<i>[narrator] The AIMS Team

00:37.838 --> 00:40.406
<i>- [Buck] Man!

00:40.408 --> 00:43.409
This monster,
it's absolutely legendary.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.309
Kill your light.

00:45.045 --> 00:45.911
[Willy] Holy [bleep].

00:45.913 --> 00:46.745
I got blood.

[Jeff] Damn!

[bellowing]

00:48.249 --> 00:49.948
What the hell was that?

00:49.983 --> 00:50.983
[all] Oh!

00:51.451 --> 00:52.584
Watch out!

00:53.019 --> 00:55.054
You better watch your ass.
This is a damn big creature!

00:55.056 --> 00:57.823
[Buck] <i>This thing ain't no
joke. This thing will kill us.</i>

00:57.825 --> 00:59.792
[Buck] It's in the tree, guys.

Look at this trail.

01:32.827 --> 01:34.059
Dude, look.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.761
Oh, my gosh!
Look, watch your step.

01:35.763 --> 01:36.395
Look!

01:39.599 --> 01:41.700
That's part of a cow.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.869
<i>I'm out here on East Point Farm,</i>

01:43.871 --> 01:46.004
right in the heart
of Tygart Valley.

01:46.806 --> 01:48.407
We got a cow killer in here.

01:49.909 --> 01:51.677
And I just followed
a blood trail

01:51.679 --> 01:53.979
out to an absolute massacre.

01:53.981 --> 01:57.216
Like something made short work
of this in a hurry.

01:57.951 --> 01:58.817
- So--
- [bellowing]

01:58.819 --> 02:00.185
Oh! God! Oh!

02:00.753 --> 02:01.787
Did you hear that?

02:01.789 --> 02:04.389
<i>I just called
the rest of team for backup,</i>

02:04.391 --> 02:07.993
but right now I'm out
here alone and unarmed.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.028
[bellowing]

02:10.030 --> 02:11.263
Oh, listen, listen.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.134
We got to move.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.736
This cow killer
is still right in the area.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.671
We got to get shelter now.
Come on, we gotta go.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.874
We gotta go, come on! Come on!

02:21.876 --> 02:23.275
We gotta go, we gotta move,
we gotta move!

02:23.277 --> 02:24.376
[bellowing]

02:25.178 --> 02:26.411
Come on,
we gotta get in this barn.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.113
Let's go.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.948
Get in there,
get in there, get in there!

02:38.158 --> 02:39.158
[sighs]

02:39.726 --> 02:40.792
Oh.

02:40.794 --> 02:43.061
I had to take cover
as quick as I could,

02:43.063 --> 02:45.030
so right now I'm held up
in this old barn.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.231
Hush, hush!

02:47.033 --> 02:47.933

02:47.935 --> 02:49.401
<i>I don't have my weapon.</i>

02:49.403 --> 02:51.303
My only option is to stay here

02:51.305 --> 02:53.138
and try to wait this thing out.

02:55.909 --> 02:56.341
Oh.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.310
Hold on.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.116
- [bellow]
- Oh!

We gotta move. We gotta move.

[meowing]

03:23.803 --> 03:25.771
Come on, come on.
I got you, buddy.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.874
It's not uncommon to find cats
in these old barns.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.009
Let's see if there's
anywhere to hide in here.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.111
<i>This one,
he's in the wrong place.</i>

03:33.680 --> 03:34.880
Oh, crap.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.082
I can't leave
this little feller in danger.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.850
So I'm gonna take him with me.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.118
[whispering] Dude,
that door's opened.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.954
That door's opened.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.292
Stay here.

03:47.860 --> 03:48.694
Stay here.

[meowing]

03:50.096 --> 03:51.230
It's okay, it's okay.

03:51.631 --> 03:52.431
Oh.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.304
If something happens
you go that way.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.212
[bellowing]

04:15.555 --> 04:16.989
It won't secure.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.191
We have to find
somewhere to go, dude.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.193
We have to find somewhere to go.

04:21.195 --> 04:22.227
[breathing heavily]

04:23.529 --> 04:24.796
[thud]

04:24.864 --> 04:27.165
[normal voice] Dude, we gotta
move. We gotta do something.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.935
Oh, oh, oh.
Right there, right there.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.236
There's a loft, there's a loft.

04:31.871 --> 04:32.404
Hold this.

04:34.974 --> 04:35.974
[grunts]

04:41.514 --> 04:42.547
Okay.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.182
[whispering] Don't move,
don't move, don't move.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.319
Dude, dude.

04:47.987 --> 04:49.288
It's right outside.

04:49.622 --> 04:50.155
[bellows]

04:50.157 --> 04:50.889
It's right outside.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.157
- [thud]
- Oh!

04:53.126 --> 04:55.060
We need to get up.
We need to get up.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.261
Give me the cat.

04:56.896 --> 04:57.963
Okay, buddy.

04:59.866 --> 05:00.599
It's okay, buddy.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.800
<i>This ain't good.</i>

05:01.802 --> 05:05.070
If this creature can rip apart
a full grown cow...

05:05.938 --> 05:07.406
It'll make short work
of this barn.

05:08.841 --> 05:10.676
And it'll make short work of me.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.311
We gotta move, we gotta move.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.054
Kill your light,
kill your light.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.390
[breathing heavily]

05:29.028 --> 05:30.028
Dude.

05:30.830 --> 05:31.330
Listen.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.131
Listen.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.173
Oh, it's underneath of us.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.308
Listen, listen, listen.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.348
Dude, did you feel
the floor shake?

05:50.083 --> 05:50.916
Did you feel the floor shake?

05:50.918 --> 05:52.884
[cracking]

05:52.886 --> 05:53.785
It's right there,
it's right there.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.753
It's underneath of this.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.258
There's a good chance
one if not both of us

06:00.260 --> 06:01.993
ain't gonna make it
out of here, bud.

06:02.862 --> 06:06.231
I'll give you everything I got
to give you a chance to run,

06:06.233 --> 06:08.033
but this isn't gonna be good.

06:08.634 --> 06:09.501
Listen.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.808
Let's see
if we can't find Buck up here.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.177
Yeah, I'm worried about him.
I'm afraid he's hurt.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.179
All he's got
is that damn flare over here.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.814
Yeah, no gun.

06:22.816 --> 06:23.749
[Willy] Oh, oh.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.817
[metal clanging]

06:25.852 --> 06:28.053
What the hell was that?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.888
Is there something coming
from the top of that silo?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.256
Sounded like metal rattlin'.

06:33.192 --> 06:34.192
You see anything up there, Jeff?

06:34.194 --> 06:35.861
[Jeff] I don't see anything.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.162
What the hell?

06:37.164 --> 06:37.996
- [bang]
- [Willy] Holy [bleep]

06:37.998 --> 06:39.831
Oh, oh!

06:39.833 --> 06:42.100
[Willy] By God
I [bleep] heard that.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.668
[Jeff] There's something
up on top there.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.003
[Willy] No doubt.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.572
Me and Jeff bro just got up
at these two big silos

06:47.574 --> 06:49.174
and we can hear
this clanging noise

06:49.176 --> 06:50.742
<i>coming right up there
from the top of it.</i>

06:50.744 --> 06:51.843
[Jeff] You see anything?

06:51.845 --> 06:53.779
<i>[Willy] It could be
the metal flexing,</i>

06:53.781 --> 06:56.014
or could just be
a loose piece of tin up there.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.283
What the hell could be
on the top of these silos?

06:58.618 --> 06:59.951
I don't have any idea.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.853
But the hair on the back
of my neck standing up,

07:01.855 --> 07:04.589
is telling me
this is something else.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.058
There's only one way to find
out what the hell is up there.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.927
- You cover me?
- [Jeff] I got your back.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.061
Just keep talking to me.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.997
If you see something hug
that ladder.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.099
Don't move,
I'll make sure I hit it.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.269
Take it easy.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.072
Don't move.
Be very, very quiet.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.241
[metal clanging]

07:23.843 --> 07:24.976
Listen, listen.

07:27.814 --> 07:28.313
[wood cracking]

07:28.981 --> 07:29.848
It's here.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.949
[kitty meows]

07:30.983 --> 07:32.250
Listen, listen.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.152
Here it comes, here it comes.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.421
Get ready, get ready.
Here it comes, here it comes.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.829
It's right there.
It's right there.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.730
Oh.

07:45.732 --> 07:46.932
Dude, you ready?
Here we go, here we go.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.066
I'm gonna stick it.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.334
Get ready, get ready, get ready.

07:50.903 --> 07:51.336
Here we go.

07:51.871 --> 07:53.071
It's right there.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.340
It's right there.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.176
[yells]

07:59.011 --> 08:00.212
[Buck] Get ready, get ready.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.279
Here we go.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.114
It's right there.

08:04.884 --> 08:05.383
It's right there.

08:07.720 --> 08:08.787
[yelling]

08:08.789 --> 08:10.355
- Oh!
- [Bill] Son of a bitch!

08:11.023 --> 08:12.624
Buck, what the hell
are you doing?

08:12.626 --> 08:15.060
[Buck] Bill, oh my Gosh, dude.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.062
- Dude...
- [Bill] Damn, you almost stab me, dude.

08:17.064 --> 08:19.064
[Buck] I was about to, yeah.

08:19.066 --> 08:19.798
Turn your light on.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.900
Oh, my gosh.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.636
My-my battery's dead.
I get [bleep].

08:24.638 --> 08:25.437
[Buck] Watch your step.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.707
Dude, I thought we was done.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.776
Usually when I get scared.
I pet Jeff's beard.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.645
[Bill] Give me that weapon.
Give me that weapon.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.913
<i>[Buck] But this little feller</i>

08:34.915 --> 08:36.114
<i>is a lot softer
and smells a lot better.</i>

08:36.116 --> 08:36.714
Come on, buddy.

08:36.716 --> 08:38.783
I'm taking him with me.

08:38.785 --> 08:41.853
I've never needed emotional support
animals as bad as I do right now.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.221
[Bill] Get down here, come on.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.125
Willy, be careful.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.830
[Willy] I ain't seeing nothing
up here, Jeff.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.131
Well, what was that noise?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.201
Maybe it was expanding
from the heat.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.436
- [Willy] Holy [bleep]
- What? What?

09:00.006 --> 09:00.405
I got blood.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.807
What? Who's that?

09:02.809 --> 09:04.109
- Is that Willy?
- Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.210
Come on. Let's go.

09:06.879 --> 09:07.412
[Buck] Come on.

09:08.214 --> 09:08.947
[kitty meows]

09:08.949 --> 09:09.414
Come on.

09:09.682 --> 09:10.548
Where?

09:10.816 --> 09:12.584
Right there in that silo
right beside me,

09:12.586 --> 09:13.852
that short fat silo.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.921
There's something
piled up right there

09:15.923 --> 09:18.189
and blood is running
right down off the side of it.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.295
What is that?

09:24.397 --> 09:27.065
It look like
a damn lighthouse over there.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.501
I can't make out
what's being said.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.002
We need to get over there.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.904
There's sure as hell
something going on over there.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.805
I'm coming down, Jeff.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.707
All right, be careful.
I got you.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.410
I gotta get over there and
see what the hell's going on.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.979
What the hell is going on?

09:40.981 --> 09:42.747
[Willy] Man, you ain't gonna
believe this.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.715
I spotted some blood.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.083
Come here. I'll show you.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.018
- [Jeff] Come on, Huck, we just found it.
- [Huck] Damn.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.789
Whatever the hell that is.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.325
That big dark stain you see
right up here on the peak of that.

09:53.893 --> 09:54.426
[Huck] Yeah.

09:55.127 --> 09:56.294
That's blood.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.097
[Jeff] Look at that.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.032
It's running
right down there off the edge.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.200
Damn.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.401
[Jeff] Right over there.
Look over there on the ground.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.302
[Billy] Whoa!

10:05.171 --> 10:06.204
Whoa!

10:06.872 --> 10:07.839
[Buck] Over here, guys.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.641
[Bill] What the hell
you got going on?

10:09.643 --> 10:11.676
[Willy] I spotted some blood
on top of this silo.

10:11.678 --> 10:14.179
It's running
right down off here...

10:16.082 --> 10:18.984
What the hell do you got
right there in your hands, Buck?

10:20.786 --> 10:21.920
[laughter]

10:21.922 --> 10:22.420
It's a kitty.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.024
[kitty meowing]

10:26.026 --> 10:26.691
What the hell you doing
with a cat?

10:26.693 --> 10:27.559
[Buck] You got blood?

10:27.561 --> 10:29.961
[Willy] Yeah,
there's blood right here.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.663
- [Jeff] See it right there?
- [Willy] It's right here on top of the silo.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.232
What the hell is there blood
on the top of that silo?

10:34.234 --> 10:35.400
That's a damn good question.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.935
There's only one way
to find out.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.838
And that's to get up there
and take a peek at it.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.872
[Buck] All right.
Be the careful, Willy.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.173
[Bill] I'm covering you.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.075
Watch what the hell
you're doing, Willy.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.944
[Buck] I can't see nothing
on the thermal up there.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.112
[Bill] You good?

10:47.580 --> 10:48.980
[Willy]
It ain't nothing up here

10:48.982 --> 10:51.149
but whatever in the hell
is piled up here on the top.

10:51.751 --> 10:52.350
What is it?

10:53.686 --> 10:54.886
[Willy] Holy [bleep]

10:54.888 --> 10:56.955
[Bill] What the hell
is it, Willy?

10:56.957 --> 11:00.392
[Willy] You guys are not
gonna believe this.

11:00.394 --> 11:01.726
- [Buck] What is it?
- [Bill] What the hell?

11:01.728 --> 11:04.095
- [Huck] Holy [bleep].
- [Bill] What the hell is that?

11:05.064 --> 11:07.065
Gentlemen, that right there.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.334
Cow after birth.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.070
- [Bill] After birth?
- [Willy] Yeah.

11:12.872 --> 11:14.406
Damn.

11:14.408 --> 11:16.941
[Buck] Why is there
after birth up there?

11:16.943 --> 11:20.345
You guys ain't gonna believe
how bad this baby stinks.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.147
Holy [bleep].

11:22.149 --> 11:23.114
[Buck] Oh!

11:23.116 --> 11:23.815
[gagging]

11:23.817 --> 11:24.816
[Billy] Come on, man!

11:26.986 --> 11:28.620
[Huck] Boy, take a big whiff
with that, man.

11:28.622 --> 11:29.487
[Willy] Whoa!

11:29.489 --> 11:30.822
[Buck] What's wrong
with you, dude?

11:30.824 --> 11:33.425
<i>When Willy threw that after
birth down from that silo.</i>

11:34.026 --> 11:34.826
[Bill] Damn.

11:34.893 --> 11:36.828
[gagging]

11:36.830 --> 11:39.898
It was like somebody blasted
a rotten corpse with a shotgun.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.700
- [Bill] You all right, Big Buck?
- Yeah.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.868
- Here, hold the kitty.
- [Huck] Boy, it stinks.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.403
<i>[Buck] That stinks?
Went everywhere.</i>

11:46.138 --> 11:47.405
[Willy] That's pretty fresh too.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.172
[Buck] Oh, man.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.274
<i>Willy?</i>

11:49.675 --> 11:52.043
He enjoyed that way too much.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.579
That sure this is
a nice looking after birth.

11:54.581 --> 11:57.482
That man is a sick, sick dude.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.984
I want you guys to think
about something for a second.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.787
Did you guys hear that
big bellow a little bit ago?

12:02.789 --> 12:05.423
- Hell, yeah.
- Yeah. How could you not?

12:05.425 --> 12:07.325
Yeah, that wasn't a Bigfoot.

12:08.694 --> 12:09.594
What do you mean?

12:10.896 --> 12:13.164
Guys, we're chasing
the wrong monster.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.466
[Willy] Wrong monster?

12:17.036 --> 12:20.338
I think I know what creature
was out here tonight hunting me.

12:20.706 --> 12:21.840
<i>And if I'm right,</i>

12:21.842 --> 12:25.844
this monster,
it's absolutely legendary.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.946
There are some things
I want to run by you guys

12:27.948 --> 12:31.449
and fill you in on,
but it will be tomorrow.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.384
- It's been a long night.
- All right, Buck.

12:33.386 --> 12:37.088
If you don't feel comfortable,
we all understand that, man.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.022
[Buck] All right.

12:38.024 --> 12:40.959
Right now I'm exhausted,
my nerves are shot,

12:40.961 --> 12:42.861
and I need to find
this little kitten's momma.

12:42.895 --> 12:43.762
Let's get out of here.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.296
- [Willy] All right.
- [Huck] All right.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.564
Make the call, brother.
Let's do it.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.832
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.667
<i>So we're going
to back out of here</i>

12:49.669 --> 12:51.369
and we're gonna
meet up tomorrow.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.606
'Cause there's a whole lot I
need to fill these guys in on.

12:54.608 --> 12:59.911
[Huck] You know, in some
countries after birth is a delicacy.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.380
[Bill] Well, Huck, right back
there's a pile you could have, buddy.

13:03.149 --> 13:03.882
Have at her.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.084
[all laughing]

13:10.790 --> 13:12.757
[Buck] I'm not a big fan
of this place,

13:12.759 --> 13:14.526
but I think it's good place
for us to have meeting.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.027
[Willy] Oh, hell, yeah.

13:16.029 --> 13:20.098
Today, the team's meeting in
the same barn I was in last night.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.733
Back at the scene of the crime.

13:21.735 --> 13:24.769
<i>I've piecing this together,
and I've got some information</i>

13:24.771 --> 13:26.538
that I think
these guys need to hear.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.940
Everybody grab a bale of hay
and let's have a seat.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.976
These guys are about to have
their minds blown.

13:31.978 --> 13:32.944
Before I get started,

13:32.946 --> 13:34.679
Jeff your beard
is really distracting me.

13:34.681 --> 13:35.980
Look at that.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.751
Looks like his beard
is kind of sideways.

13:39.753 --> 13:43.621
Once again,
Jeff's beard steals the show.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.624
Just because this beard
is older than you

13:46.626 --> 13:50.995
doesn't mean you
can pick on it, little boy.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.832
[Jeff] <i>When you boil it all
down, Buck's got one thing.</i>

13:53.866 --> 13:54.799
Beard envy.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.968
Right there's something
older than you.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.002
[all laughing]

13:58.004 --> 14:00.972
That hair has seen a dinosaur.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.307
- [whispering]
- [all laughing]

14:05.511 --> 14:07.312
What? What were you
saying to him?

14:09.081 --> 14:12.283
Huck wasn't sure if that came
out of his chin or his crotch.

14:23.729 --> 14:24.963
Whoa!

14:24.997 --> 14:26.664
This train has derailed.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.300
I'm only here
<i>for Mountain Monsters, boys.</i>

14:30.836 --> 14:33.204
[Buck] So, last night, told
you guys I found a gut pile.

14:33.839 --> 14:34.739
Right.

14:34.806 --> 14:35.974
We was looking at it.
Something chased us.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.942
Come on,
we gotta get in this barn.

14:37.944 --> 14:40.011
Let's go.
Get in there, get in there.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.112
We ended up, up in that loft.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.046
It's okay, buddy.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.214
Dude, we gotta move.

14:43.415 --> 14:45.216
<i>Trying to hide from whatever
it was that was after us.</i>

14:46.819 --> 14:49.287
That's when I almost stabbed
Bill in the face with a pitchfork.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.489
[yelling]

14:51.491 --> 14:53.157
- Oh.
- [Bill] Son of a bitch!

14:54.126 --> 14:55.493
- [Buck] Bill.
- [Bill] Buck, what are you doing?

14:55.495 --> 14:56.694
You sure you didn't hit him?

14:59.765 --> 15:02.967
I can't take too many more
boots to the face, brother.

15:08.974 --> 15:11.542
Before Bill showed up
last night,

15:11.544 --> 15:13.244
there was
something else in here.

15:17.950 --> 15:22.420
I think what was in here last
night was the Grafton Monster.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.091
[Bill] The Grafton Monster?

15:27.093 --> 15:28.626
- [Buck] Yeah.
- [Bill] Wow.

15:28.628 --> 15:32.830
<i>[Buck] The Grafton Monster
was first spotted back in 1964.</i>

15:32.832 --> 15:35.266
<i>Sightings have been
pouring in since.</i>

15:35.268 --> 15:36.668
<i>One of the most famous monsters</i>

15:36.670 --> 15:38.603
<i>in the Appalachian Mountains.</i>

15:38.605 --> 15:40.471
It's one of the most famous
in the world.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.541
This thing has got a lot of
history and it ain't no joke.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.777
- What makes you think that?
- Yeah, why is that?

15:45.779 --> 15:47.946
[Buck] You guys need to think
about that for a second.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.981
Last night you heard
that big bellow, right?

15:50.048 --> 15:52.116
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.151
- [Buck] Check it out.
- [bellowing]

15:53.153 --> 15:54.252
Oh!

15:55.821 --> 15:58.056
Listen to that.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.158
Well, I was standing there
listening to it.

16:00.926 --> 16:02.393
I almost had like a flashback.

16:02.728 --> 16:05.596
2013 in Grafton.

16:05.598 --> 16:08.032
<i>We was interviewing
an eye witness named Doc.</i>

16:08.034 --> 16:10.702
- I'm Trapper.
- Oh, nice to meet you, I'm Doc.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.136
- That little dude, yeah.
- Yeah.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.205
Well, while I was there
interviewing him,

16:14.940 --> 16:16.407
we heard a great big bellow.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.643
[bellow]

16:18.645 --> 16:20.345
- Wow.
- Wow.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.412
[Huck] Imagine that?
What was that?

16:21.414 --> 16:22.947
- [Buck] You heard that?
- [Doc] Yes, I heard that.

16:22.949 --> 16:23.648
[Buck] What was that?

16:23.650 --> 16:24.849
[Doc] That's him.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.084
- That's the damn Grafton Monster.
- [Jeff] Damn.

16:26.585 --> 16:27.552
I remember that.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.821
It scared him so bad
he walked off.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.789
Hell, he moved
to Florida, in fact.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.392
Last night,
when I heard that bellow

16:35.961 --> 16:38.229
it sounded
an awful lot like it did.

16:38.697 --> 16:39.831
[Willy] Boy it did.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.033
[Buck] So I asked Colt
to do me a favor.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.434
You guys know
when we're filming,

16:44.069 --> 16:45.236
we get mic-ed up.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.704
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.373
Hello, hello.
Come in, come in.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.708
I got a mic right here.

16:50.909 --> 16:53.277
He wasn't a radio man in
the Marine Corps, wasn't he?

16:55.748 --> 16:57.315
They don't have subtitles.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.220
[Bill] Sons of bitches.

17:03.822 --> 17:04.956
[Buck] All right.

17:05.391 --> 17:06.991
So we're mic-ed here.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.327
And the cameras
have mics, right?

17:09.329 --> 17:09.794
- Right.
- Yeah.

17:09.796 --> 17:10.995
[Buck] Okay.

17:10.997 --> 17:15.066
So I asked Colt to isolate
the audio on the camera,

17:15.567 --> 17:17.068
from what we heard last night.

17:17.070 --> 17:19.337
- [Huck] Good job.
- Yeah, smart move.

17:19.339 --> 17:23.708
I also asked him
to dig up the audio from 2013

17:23.710 --> 17:28.212
when we interviewed Doc and
isolate it as well so we can compare.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.215
- Yeah.
- That's using the old noggin for...

17:36.155 --> 17:36.821
Yeah!

17:36.823 --> 17:39.023
Give me one on that, brother.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.265
So my question to you guys is,
do you want to hear it?

17:47.933 --> 17:49.967
- Hell yeah!
- [Huck] Hell yes.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.435
You know we do.

17:51.437 --> 17:55.873
I reached out and got the isolated
audio of what we heard last night.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.141
The team needs to hear this.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.812
[bellowing]

18:00.814 --> 18:02.280
[Bill] Listen to that.

18:03.782 --> 18:04.982
- Wow.
- [Willy] Damn.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.818
That was about
75 yards away from me.

18:06.820 --> 18:09.487
[cows mooing]

18:09.489 --> 18:11.856
- Yeah, them cows.
- Yeah, you hear them cows.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.026
Just by playing that right there's
got them babies all worked up.

18:15.028 --> 18:17.628
Something tells me
they've heard that before.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.130
- [Willy] Hell, yeah.
- [Bill] Yeah.

18:19.132 --> 18:22.066
[Buck] Now, this is
the isolated audio

18:22.068 --> 18:26.237
from when we interviewed Doc
right there in Grafton, West Virginia.

18:26.939 --> 18:27.972
Listen.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.412
[bellowing]

18:36.548 --> 18:37.482
[Willy] Wow!

18:37.549 --> 18:39.417
- [Huck] Same exact sound.
- [Bill] Hell yeah.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.951
[Willy] Hell yes,
there's a match right there.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.855
<i>[Huck] After hearing those two
recordings right back to back,</i>

18:43.857 --> 18:45.723
<i>there's no doubt about it,</i>

18:45.725 --> 18:47.825
this here
is the Grafton Monster.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.595
We're only,
by the way crow flies,

18:50.597 --> 18:53.464
about 50 miles from
where we was at in Grafton.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.267
Hell, that'd be a hop,
skip and jump for him.

18:56.269 --> 19:01.072
We have no idea why this Grafton
Monster is here in the Tygart Valley.

19:02.407 --> 19:06.010
We need to figure out what this
big son of a bitch is doing here.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.279
And you guys
found something last night.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.047
Something out of place, right?

19:10.115 --> 19:11.182
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:11.750 --> 19:12.950
[Jeff] Look at that.

19:16.688 --> 19:19.190
And then that big pile of
rocks with that skull on it.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.060
What the hell is that?

19:25.764 --> 19:27.965
[Buck] Guys, I think
right over there,

19:27.967 --> 19:30.501
it's the Grafton
Monster's bedroom.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.837
There's only one way
we're going to find out.

19:32.839 --> 19:36.941
I need you guys to go back
out there, take a closer look.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.643
- Yeah.
- I think it's a good call, Buck source.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.612
<i>[Buck] The next step is
I gotta head to work.</i>

19:41.614 --> 19:44.048
The team needs
to head back out to the woods

19:44.050 --> 19:45.883
right where they found
those structures.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.151
What the hell?

19:47.719 --> 19:49.220
<i>[Buck] And take a closer look.</i>

19:49.222 --> 19:51.422
I think that that is the heart

19:51.424 --> 19:53.257
of the Grafton Monster's
territory.

19:53.259 --> 19:53.958
Are you guys ready?

19:53.960 --> 19:54.759
- [Huck] Yeah.
- Hell yeah!

19:54.761 --> 19:56.928
All right. Let's roll.

19:56.930 --> 20:01.866
I'm telling you right now,
the legendary Grafton Monster

20:01.868 --> 20:03.201
<i>is right here
in the Tygart Valley.</i>

20:04.403 --> 20:05.435
Why?

20:06.071 --> 20:08.439
That's what the AIMS Team
needs to figure out.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.174
Let's chase some monsters!

20:12.344 --> 20:15.880
Today, we're headed out
to do a field investigation.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.182
[Willy] We haven't got too
much farther up over this horizon.

20:18.750 --> 20:19.584
[Huck] Good deal.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.785
<i>I want to get back out there</i>

20:20.787 --> 20:23.321
where we found them limbs up
against that tree.

20:24.590 --> 20:28.059
And that rock pile
with the cow skull on it.

20:29.127 --> 20:32.597
The other night we didn't get a
real good chance to look around,

20:32.599 --> 20:35.566
but today we got sunshine.

20:35.568 --> 20:39.070
I see a lot more in the
day light, that's for sure.

20:39.072 --> 20:42.506
<i>[Huck] The one thing the
Grafton Monster didn't count on</i>

20:42.508 --> 20:44.842
was this [bleep] damn AIMS Team.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.845
We're on his trail,
we're coming after him,

20:47.847 --> 20:50.615
and by God we're going
to catch him.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.050
Looks like these woods are
really greening up out here, isn't it?

20:53.052 --> 20:54.385
- [Jeff] Oh, buddy.
- [Huck] Yeah.

20:54.786 --> 20:56.988
Check this right here out.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.156
- [Jeff] What do we got?
- [Willy] Look right here.

21:00.359 --> 21:01.993
[Jeff] Is that a footprint?

21:01.995 --> 21:05.129
I don't know, something's
kicked up the leaves right here.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.864
Something heavy stepped there.

21:06.931 --> 21:08.399
I'll say.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.568
[Willy] Holy [bleep].
Look at this.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.969
[Jeff] What do you got, Willy?

21:11.971 --> 21:13.337
- Check this here out.
- [Jeff] Wow!

21:13.639 --> 21:14.939
Damn.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.142
- That's pretty big.
- [Willy] What the hell?

21:18.144 --> 21:19.477
[Jeff] Something bedded up.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.412
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.048
We worked up there, all
the leaves are pushed back.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.050
Yeah, it looks like
a bedding area.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.285
You guys smell that?

21:27.853 --> 21:28.986
Yeah, I do.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.289
I know that smell.

21:32.924 --> 21:33.991
That's death.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.996
When we walked up here
and found this bedding area

21:38.998 --> 21:41.032
where this thing was setting,

21:41.700 --> 21:42.833
I got the heebie jeebies.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.202
You just gave me cold chills.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.838
You damn sure we all
have them, buddy.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.206
Make that two of us.

21:51.677 --> 21:53.377
Looking down here.

21:53.379 --> 21:55.646
<i>You can see all the
leaves are kicked back.</i>

21:55.648 --> 21:59.984
You can see something big and heavy
had laid in there mashed the dirt down.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.887
Something big
has been setting right here.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.690
This thing,
this creature is huge.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.458
See how that mark is
in the ground.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.760
- [Huck] Yeah.
- [Willy] It's kind of like a big handprint.

22:09.762 --> 22:13.164
There's only a couple of creatures
big enough out here to do that.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.766
[Willy] Look at that, I mean,
it's twice the size of my hand.

22:15.768 --> 22:16.767
- Wow.
- Damn.

22:16.769 --> 22:17.968
One of them is a Bigfoot.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.805
The other one
is the Grafton Monster.

22:20.807 --> 22:23.040
I tell you what,
I'm gonna site something.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.875
Can you get down there
where we were just at?

22:24.943 --> 22:26.010
Yeah.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.411
I wanna see something here.

22:29.948 --> 22:32.983
So you gotta think about that
Grafton Monster, he's got that head.

22:33.018 --> 22:33.918
[Huck] Yeah.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.086
Look at this right here.

22:35.854 --> 22:36.821
Right here, Jeff.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.322
Right here is where we was at.

22:38.324 --> 22:39.890
He was right down on the ground.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.126
And he was white knuckling
or watching us.

22:42.128 --> 22:45.696
Look at this, Huckleberry,
right down through there.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.099
[Huck] <i>I think that Grafton
Monster was laying right there</i>

22:48.101 --> 22:51.769
just like he said
waiting to pounce on us.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.404
Tell you what, Huckleberry,

22:54.840 --> 22:58.142
that Grafton Monster,
it was stalking us.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.611
We didn't know it at the time,

23:00.613 --> 23:03.814
<i>but we was only like 40
or 50 yards away from him.</i>

23:03.816 --> 23:05.883
This son of a bitch,
he's a stalker.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.686
We came here for a reason.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.122
We gotta get out there
at that structure

23:11.124 --> 23:13.057
and where those rocks piles are.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.726
We better do it damn cautiously.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.395
He's not choosy
about what he eats,

23:17.397 --> 23:18.829
I can guarantee you that.

23:18.831 --> 23:19.897
Oh, yeah.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.699
If that Grafton Monster
was to come up on us...

23:21.701 --> 23:23.968
I'll just keep working this way.

23:23.970 --> 23:28.038
it'd takes six months to put all
the hillbilly pieces back together.

23:31.009 --> 23:33.711
He shouldn't be
too much farther.

23:33.713 --> 23:34.845
[Jeff] Got me
a ball of nerves, man.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.247
That thing is stalking us.

23:36.249 --> 23:39.216
Man, I'm trying to grow eyes
in the back of my head.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.419
[Jeff] I don't spot stuff as well
as you, that's what worries me.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.286
[Willy] Hey.

23:42.821 --> 23:44.155
Right up there it is.

23:44.556 --> 23:46.190
- [Huck] Oh, yeah.
- [Jeff] Yeah.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.093
<i>[Willy] We just spotted
that tree structure.</i>

23:49.095 --> 23:50.828
<i>Up there about 50, 60 yards.</i>

23:50.830 --> 23:52.496
Let's ease on up in there.

23:52.498 --> 23:54.231
<i>We need to go up there
with caution</i>

23:54.233 --> 23:57.067
because we know we got a
Grafton monster in this area.

23:57.135 --> 23:58.436
Whoa!

24:00.839 --> 24:02.173
It's gotten bigger.

24:07.212 --> 24:08.212
[Willy] Hey.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.413
Right up there it is.

24:10.849 --> 24:11.382
[Huck] Yeah.

24:12.050 --> 24:13.317
[Jeff] Whoa!

24:16.087 --> 24:17.354
It's gotten bigger.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.296
Yes, it has.

24:25.298 --> 24:26.363
A lot bigger.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.968
[Willy] Yeah, the other night
when we was in here.

24:31.736 --> 24:35.806
I don't remember any
of these maples being in here.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.776
And all these on the backside
wasn't in here, guys.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.744
<i>We get up
to that tree structure,</i>

24:40.746 --> 24:43.113
<i>and you can clearly see
it's growed,</i>

24:43.115 --> 24:45.282
it's way bigger
than it was the other day.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.351
This hickory is all new.

24:49.387 --> 24:51.822
This maple right here is new.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.924
The other night, there
was only about half the logs

24:53.926 --> 24:56.126
around one side
of this maple tree.

24:56.962 --> 24:59.396
Now it goes all the way around.

25:00.866 --> 25:02.500
Even this cherry,
this one wasn't here,

25:02.502 --> 25:03.901
there was nothing on this side.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.337
Hey, there's more rock piles
over there.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.138
There's two more.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.373
There's three now.

25:11.543 --> 25:13.210
And the skull is gone.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.780
[Huck] What the hell
we got going on here?

25:16.782 --> 25:19.917
The other night we just had
that one rock structure

25:19.919 --> 25:22.253
with that skull
sitting on top of it.

25:23.822 --> 25:26.190
And now we got three
of these rock piles.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.361
And the skulls is missing.

25:31.930 --> 25:35.799
Rock piles like this
that takes some intelligence.

25:35.801 --> 25:37.902
What the hell is all this about?

25:37.904 --> 25:40.271
This looks like
Bigfoot sign to me.

25:41.072 --> 25:42.439
I mean, look
how this is stacked.

25:43.775 --> 25:45.042
- You're right, Jeff.
- [Huck] Yeah.

25:45.243 --> 25:46.977
That tree structure.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.445
These rock piles.

25:49.648 --> 25:51.849
That's exactly Bigfoot sign.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.984
But we got
the Grafton Monster out here.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.520
Maybe he does the same thing.

25:56.522 --> 25:58.722
<i>Something's not adding up here.</i>

25:58.724 --> 26:01.992
We know the Grafton Monster
is in this country.

26:01.994 --> 26:04.862
<i>This tree structure
and these rock piles.</i>

26:04.864 --> 26:07.398
That's clearly Bigfoot.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.034
Jeff, this thing
ain't making much sense to me.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.135
[Jeff] No.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.670
We know we've got
the Grafton Monster.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.138
[Willy] Hey.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.005
[Jeff] What do you got, Willy?

26:15.007 --> 26:16.140
[Willy] Look what I found.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.077
A dog collar.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.412
No way!

26:21.414 --> 26:23.080
Right there by that big log.

26:23.348 --> 26:24.548
Oh, man.

26:24.550 --> 26:27.685
We found all kinds of dog
collars by that old hollow log.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.386
- Check this out!
- [Jeff] Look at the size of that.

26:29.388 --> 26:30.721
- [Bill] Look at that.
- [Willy] Damn.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.456
That's got a tag on it.

26:32.458 --> 26:35.926
And now we're finding
dog collars out here?

26:35.928 --> 26:39.096
Look, it's been ripped in two
just like the other ones.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.664
[Jeff] Just like the other ones.

26:40.666 --> 26:41.799
I'm telling you right now,

26:41.801 --> 26:45.069
it ain't looking too good
the Tygart Valley for dogs.

26:45.837 --> 26:48.205
We've got a big mystery
here on our hands.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.573
Damn straight we do.

26:49.741 --> 26:53.177
It's starting to get dark,
we ain't got enough light.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.212
I say we shuffle out of here.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.014
I say you're right.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.183
This mystery here
in the Tygart Valley

27:00.719 --> 27:03.053
it's just like pea soup,

27:03.055 --> 27:05.055
it just keeps getting thicker
and thicker.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.591
[Willy] Let's head right back
out across the way we come.

27:07.593 --> 27:08.959
[Jeff] Lead the way, brother.

27:11.329 --> 27:12.529
[Buck] This is
a pretty good size farm.

27:12.531 --> 27:13.497
[Huck] This is a dandy.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.132
<i>[Buck] Today we're
getting ready to meet</i>

27:15.134 --> 27:17.701
<i>with an eyewitness named
Terry, local cattle farmer.</i>

27:17.703 --> 27:19.670
There's the man.
Hey! How are you doing?

27:19.672 --> 27:21.705
- [Willy] Hey there.
- How we doing, fellers.

27:21.707 --> 27:24.074
<i>[Buck] Apparently he's had
some cattle come up missing</i>

27:24.076 --> 27:25.909
and we're here to find out
what happened.

27:25.911 --> 27:26.577
How you doing?

27:26.579 --> 27:27.878
[Terry] Not too bad.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.881
Terry's got about 500
acres here, it's a big farm.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.416
[Huck] My name is Huckleberry.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.884
- Terry.
- [Huck] Nice to meet you.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.986
<i>[Buck] A 150 head of cattle.</i>

27:35.988 --> 27:36.954
This man's got a good operation.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.222
Wild Bill, Ooh Ra!

27:38.224 --> 27:40.891
OHJ, there's a Marine handshake.

27:40.893 --> 27:41.425
Hell yeah.

27:41.427 --> 27:42.393
[laugher]

27:42.395 --> 27:43.727
[Willy] That's what we want,
ain't it?

27:43.729 --> 27:45.129
Yeah, about take my arm off.

27:46.231 --> 27:48.332
Once a jarhead,
always a jarhead.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.132
Yes, sir.

27:49.134 --> 27:50.567
We got another one
right over there.

27:50.569 --> 27:52.336
Well, he ain't as perty as you?

27:56.574 --> 27:58.609
So what bring you fellers
out this way?

27:58.611 --> 28:01.979
Well, Terry, we noticed you got
a pretty good set of cattle here.

28:01.981 --> 28:05.416
Yep, got a few beef cattle,
got a few milking cattle.

28:05.418 --> 28:06.717
How many head you got here?

28:06.751 --> 28:08.819
About 150.

28:08.821 --> 28:11.555
Man, I don't even know
if I can milk a cow anymore.

28:11.557 --> 28:15.759
I've got that new fancy milking
machines out there and does all the work.

28:15.761 --> 28:18.095
Old Jeff, he likes
to milk the bulls.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.067
Yeah. I can tell.

28:23.935 --> 28:27.371
You might get a little,
but you ain't gonna get a lot.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.308
And it's awful salty.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.416
<i>[Huck] I thought we came here
to talk about a creature,</i>

28:39.584 --> 28:41.719
no not damn bull semen.

28:41.721 --> 28:46.390
Well, on your behalf, it's worth
more on the gallon than milk is.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.425
Yeah, but how long
would it take to get a gallon?

28:53.865 --> 28:55.766
<i>[Huck] Sometimes on
Mountain Monsters</i>

28:55.768 --> 28:57.968
things sort of go off the rails.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.369
<i>Welcome to Mountain Monsters.</i>

29:05.143 --> 29:07.144
[Buck] Anybody remember
why we're here?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.012
[Bill] Yeah.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.915
I think the damn train
just derailed.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.752
[Buck] Terry, the reason
we're in the Tygart Valley

29:14.754 --> 29:16.520
is there's mystery
going on in these woods.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.622
We wanted to meet with you.

29:18.624 --> 29:20.758
Jeff told me that you've been
having some problems with your cows

29:20.760 --> 29:22.426
over the last three
or four weeks.

29:22.428 --> 29:25.195
Yeah, yeah, I've had
a couple of problems.

29:25.197 --> 29:28.732
I had got a yearling calf
come up missing

29:28.734 --> 29:31.001
about a month ago.

29:31.003 --> 29:34.004
Walked the fences,
checked the fields,

29:34.006 --> 29:36.273
checked the woods,
checked the pond.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.374
Nothing.

29:38.943 --> 29:43.380
Week after that, I had
another calf come up missing.

29:44.182 --> 29:46.150
This time we did find something.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.619
What did you find?

29:48.621 --> 29:50.220
Well, we found a head.

29:51.222 --> 29:52.856
- [Huck] A head?
- [Buck] You found a head?

29:52.858 --> 29:53.857
[Terry] Found a head.

29:53.859 --> 29:55.926
That's it, just a damn head?

29:55.928 --> 29:57.094
It was all tore up.

29:57.829 --> 29:59.196
[Willy] Damn!

29:59.198 --> 30:01.064
Didn't you find
any other part of the caw?

30:01.066 --> 30:02.399
Not a hide nor hair.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.534
Holy hell!

30:03.536 --> 30:05.736
When I came across the cow
with his head ripped off,

30:05.738 --> 30:08.772
<i>it was the scariest thing
I've ever seen.</i>

30:08.774 --> 30:10.841
<i>I've never seen nothing
like that in my life.</i>

30:10.843 --> 30:12.042
<i>It rattles you.</i>

30:12.044 --> 30:14.545
I don't want to be the next
one with my head ripped off.

30:14.547 --> 30:15.846
I mean, what could be out here

30:15.848 --> 30:18.282
that's completely ripping off
the head of a cow.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.618
2013. Just think about it.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.420
When we was
after the Grafton Monster.

30:24.856 --> 30:27.991
Didn't it rip
the head off of that deer?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.827
That son of a bitch
just killed a deer right here.

30:29.829 --> 30:30.694
- Look here.
- [Bill] Hey.

30:30.696 --> 30:32.162
[Willy] Look here.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.831
- [Bill] Hell yeah.
- Put it up on that oil tank.

30:33.833 --> 30:34.798
Put it up on that oil tank.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.633
And see,
that was so many years ago,

30:36.635 --> 30:38.802
he might have graduated
to something way bigger.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.737
<i>[Buck] Willy just pointed
something out.</i>

30:40.739 --> 30:44.341
In 2013 when we was
in Grafton, Willy and Bill

30:44.343 --> 30:46.810
found the head of a deer
up on top of oil drum.

30:46.812 --> 30:49.413
This top of this tank
is covered with blood.

30:49.415 --> 30:51.615
[Buck] <i>That's the calling
card of the Grafton Monster.</i>

30:51.617 --> 30:53.383
[Bill] He's there
for the meat eater.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.953
And now, Terry said
he found the head of a cow,

30:55.955 --> 30:57.521
that's a lot bigger than a deer,

30:57.523 --> 31:00.858
but I'm telling you, the
Grafton Monster, it's capable.

31:00.860 --> 31:03.694
So you haven't had any more
problems since you lost that one?

31:03.696 --> 31:06.864
Let me tell you about something
that happened not too long ago.

31:06.866 --> 31:09.733
I come out of the side
of the silo there

31:09.735 --> 31:11.501
and all the cows were running up

31:11.503 --> 31:12.836
toward that other building,

31:12.838 --> 31:15.038
I mean, just running
like beat the hell.

31:19.043 --> 31:22.246
And I thought, "What the hell
is out here scaring my cattle?"

31:23.514 --> 31:25.015
I heard something over here.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.751
So I slink down back in,
look down over there,

31:27.753 --> 31:29.419
and I caught the son of a bitch,

31:29.421 --> 31:32.289
it was slinking down cross
that fence line right there.

31:32.957 --> 31:34.424
Caught him on video.

31:34.426 --> 31:35.525
- Really?
- [Willy] Damn.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.828
- You got him on video?
- Yeah, I'll tell you what now.

31:37.830 --> 31:41.798
Once you guys see this thing,
you ain't gonna believe it.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.834
Now, look in them eyes,
these eyes don't lie.

31:43.836 --> 31:47.404
That son of a bitch was big.
He was one big bad mother.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.007
And it's got you pretty well
shook up, doesn't it?

31:50.009 --> 31:51.208
It put the fear in me.

31:51.509 --> 31:52.876
[Bill] We see that.

31:53.044 --> 31:56.380
Terry said he got a video of
what he believe is killing his cows.

31:56.382 --> 31:58.548
We damn well got to see this.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.785
I come out around there and
this is what I first caught to sees.

32:01.787 --> 32:03.120
<i>These cows
are running like dickens,</i>

32:03.122 --> 32:04.755
<i>I've never seen them
run like that.</i>

32:04.757 --> 32:06.823
Like a damn stampede.

32:06.825 --> 32:09.960
I come walking around this way
and down over the hill there

32:09.962 --> 32:11.595
<i>and look around
and couldn't see nothing.</i>

32:11.597 --> 32:13.997
Yeah, right there.

32:13.999 --> 32:16.033
<i>[Terry] I got around the
other side of the tractor,</i>

32:16.035 --> 32:18.368
and, gentlemen,
here's the kicker.

32:22.407 --> 32:24.007
<i>- [Buck] Man!
- [Bill] Damn!</i>

32:24.009 --> 32:24.942
[bleep]

32:24.944 --> 32:25.976
[Willy] Look at that.

32:25.978 --> 32:28.178
[Terry] Scared the daylights
out of me now.

32:28.346 --> 32:30.280
<i>[Buck] Look at the size of that.</i>

32:32.984 --> 32:35.886
<i>[Terry] I come out around there
and this is what I first caught to sees.</i>

32:35.888 --> 32:36.887
<i>[Buck] We're
in the Tygart Valley.</i>

32:36.889 --> 32:38.722
<i>And we came here
to catch a Bigfoot.</i>

32:38.724 --> 32:39.890
<i>Things have changed.</i>

32:39.892 --> 32:41.658
These cows
are running like dickens,

32:41.660 --> 32:42.960
<i>I've never seen them
running like that.</i>

32:42.962 --> 32:45.862
We had no idea
what we was getting into

32:45.864 --> 32:47.564
when we met up with Terry today.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.533
Like a damn stampede.

32:49.535 --> 32:52.069
But it sounds like
he may have a video

32:52.071 --> 32:54.838
of what we're after,
the Grafton Monster.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.974
<i>[Terry] I got around the
other side of the tractor,</i>

32:56.976 --> 32:59.309
and, gentlemen,
here's the kicker.

33:03.047 --> 33:04.881
<i>- [Buck] Man!
- [Bill] Damn!</i>

33:04.883 --> 33:05.682
[bleep]

33:05.684 --> 33:06.717
[Willy] Look at that.

33:06.719 --> 33:08.285
[Terry] Scared the daylights
out of me now.

33:09.754 --> 33:11.154
<i>[Buck] Look at the size of that.</i>

33:11.723 --> 33:13.323
The Grafton Monster.

33:17.161 --> 33:20.430
That right there,
that's your cow killer.

33:21.399 --> 33:22.699
Huck, I think you're right.

33:22.701 --> 33:23.734
After seeing this video,

33:23.736 --> 33:25.969
<i>there's no damn doubt about it.</i>

33:25.971 --> 33:29.673
That's the Grafton Monster
walking all hunched over like that,

33:29.675 --> 33:30.941
<i>I can't see his damn head.</i>

33:30.943 --> 33:33.043
That's the Grafton Monster.

33:33.045 --> 33:34.678
Where exactly was this taken?

33:34.680 --> 33:35.712
Right over there.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.415
Between that fence
post and the rails.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.816
Care if we go over there
and look around a little bit?

33:39.818 --> 33:41.918
Help yourself. Good luck.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.420
- [Buck] Thank you, sir.
- [Bill] Yeah.

33:43.422 --> 33:44.421
[Buck] Let's go over there
and look guys.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.423
[Willy] Yeah, let's go
take a gander look see.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.892
[Buck] <i>After seeing that
video, we need to get over there</i>

33:48.894 --> 33:51.762
and see if we can get a size
comparison on this Grafton Monster.

33:51.764 --> 33:53.930
I'm gonna stand
on this side of the fence.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.866
You just make sure
you come back with your head.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.968
Be very careful.

33:57.970 --> 33:58.902
We'll definitely
come back with our heads.

33:58.904 --> 34:02.205
No way in hell
do I want to be out there.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.774
<i>I'm sorry, you all on your own.</i>

34:03.776 --> 34:06.309
This old man is gonna stay
close to the house.

34:06.311 --> 34:08.812
This fence post
is taller than me.

34:08.814 --> 34:11.782
I can't even reach
how high that thing was

34:11.784 --> 34:14.251
when it just slipped
right through here.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.786
<i>[Jeff] That's seven
or eight feet up in the air.</i>

34:15.788 --> 34:16.720
<i>[Bill] Hell, yeah.</i>

34:16.722 --> 34:19.222
It's gonna be hard
to find anything.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.558
[Willy] Ain't see no tracks
in this dirt right here.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.726
[Buck] No.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.127
[Willy] I know we had
a lot of rain.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.129
Hang on. Look at this, Will.

34:26.431 --> 34:27.297
[Willy] What do you got?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.599
[Willy] No cow track.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.301
[Huck] Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.038
You can see where something
come in here and slid

34:35.040 --> 34:35.572
and come to a stop.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.974
Hell yeah.

34:37.976 --> 34:40.677
And whenever it did, it kicked this
mud right up into this grass right here.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.813
[Bill] Yeah.

34:42.815 --> 34:45.082
- And man, that looks like about a week old or so.
- [bellowing]

34:45.550 --> 34:47.584
What the hell was that?

34:47.586 --> 34:48.985
- [Bill] Damn!
- [Buck] Listen. Come on.

34:48.987 --> 34:51.288
You hear?
It was right down there.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.022
It's just right over the ridge.

34:52.024 --> 34:53.990
- [Jeff] Let's go.
- [Buck] Come on.

34:54.559 --> 34:55.926
We're standing there
looking at this track,

34:55.928 --> 34:59.096
all of a sudden, right down
the bottom of this holler,

34:59.098 --> 35:01.431
<i>and as you can hear
this loud bellow.</i>

35:01.433 --> 35:03.400
[Jeff] I'm gonna lay
some eyes on this critter.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.035
<i>[Buck] I know exactly
what that is.</i>

35:05.037 --> 35:08.705
I heard it the other night,
and I heard in 2013.

35:08.707 --> 35:09.873
That is the Grafton Monster.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.842
I know we got no weapons,

35:11.844 --> 35:13.710
but let's just run over here
at the edge of the bank.

35:13.712 --> 35:15.946
See if we can't lay
some eyes on him.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.781
Listen, I don't want to do...

35:17.783 --> 35:18.782
I don't want to push this
without any guns.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.817
Hell no, me neither.

35:20.819 --> 35:24.020
But that just right there.
It's within 100, 150 yards.

35:24.889 --> 35:26.690
Let's go get our lights
and get our weapons.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.225
Hell yeah.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.193
And then let's get
out there. All right?

35:30.195 --> 35:32.829
Grafton Monster,
we're coming after your ass.

35:32.831 --> 35:33.697
[Buck] Yeah.

35:33.699 --> 35:34.598
- [Bill] Hell yeah.
- [Jeff] Yes.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.366
[Bill] Hell yeah.
We'll be back.

35:36.368 --> 35:38.001
- Don't go nowhere.
- [Buck] Let's go, brother.

35:38.003 --> 35:38.702
Let's go get our weapons.

35:38.704 --> 35:39.736
Let's go.

35:39.738 --> 35:40.871
<i>[Huck] There's
no damn doubt about it.</i>

35:40.873 --> 35:44.674
<i>What we just heard
was the Grafton Monster</i>

35:44.676 --> 35:46.510
<i>and it's just down here
in the holler.</i>

35:46.512 --> 35:47.878
It's starting to get dark,

35:47.880 --> 35:50.881
we're gonna get back,
get our lights, our weapons,

35:50.883 --> 35:53.750
the thermal and we're going in
after that big bastard.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.385
[Buck] This thing ain't no joke.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.954
- [Willy] No.
- [Buck] This thing will kill us.

36:03.694 --> 36:06.496
<i>We just got our guns,
our lights and the thermal.</i>

36:06.498 --> 36:07.531
<i>We're heading down
into the woods</i>

36:07.533 --> 36:09.432
<i>where we just heard
the Grafton Monster.</i>

36:09.434 --> 36:13.036
It's time for the AIMS Team
to do a little stalking at dusk.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.807
Man, could you feel the power in
the lungs of that Grafton Monster?

36:17.809 --> 36:18.842
[Buck] Oh, yeah.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.678
[Bill] Hell, yeah,
shook me in my boots.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.213
I ain't heard nothing
scream like that

36:23.215 --> 36:25.949
since Jeff on the Jhon
on chimichanga night.

36:26.016 --> 36:27.951
[all laughing]

36:30.121 --> 36:31.721
Man, you know I like it spicy.

36:31.756 --> 36:33.823
[laughter]

36:33.825 --> 36:36.726
When it comes to Jeff
and using the bathroom,

36:36.728 --> 36:38.261
he makes a lot
of different sounds

36:39.063 --> 36:40.230
but chimichanga night...

36:41.966 --> 36:43.032
that's bad.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.534
I've never seen a man
go through so many plungers.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.937
[laughter]

36:46.939 --> 36:50.173
One time it sound like two
chipmunks humping in a wool sock.

36:50.207 --> 36:51.308
Weird.

36:54.245 --> 36:56.279
[Jeff] Sounded like it was
right up in here somewhere.

36:56.747 --> 36:58.348
[Huck] Yeah, keep your eyes out.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.516
[Buck] Yeah, look here.
Look here, look here.

36:59.518 --> 37:02.285
[Willy] What do you got?
What do you got there?

37:03.988 --> 37:06.556
Something big kicked up through
here, look, it kicked the bark off.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.624
Right here is part of the bark.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.794
Something was on the move
right here, something big.

37:10.796 --> 37:12.629
Huck, do you remember when
we was up here the other day,

37:12.631 --> 37:14.731
on that daytime investigation?

37:14.733 --> 37:17.901
You remember where that big
bed was up there by that maple tree?

37:17.903 --> 37:19.803
- Oh, yeah.
- It looked like something was stalking us.

37:19.805 --> 37:20.437
Damn.

37:23.507 --> 37:24.741
This just right up here.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.943
Let's go up there and show it
to these two guys.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.011
[Huck] These guys
ain't see them.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.146
Come on, I'll show you.

37:31.749 --> 37:32.749
[Bill] You guys watch out now,

37:32.751 --> 37:35.018
remember that bastard's
in here somewhere

37:35.020 --> 37:36.086
[Buck] I tell you,
if this is a hot lady

37:36.088 --> 37:38.655
who just bellowed in there
a few minutes ago.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.190
By God, did you hear that?

37:40.192 --> 37:42.025
[Willy] Yeah, right here,
right here, right here.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.059
Right here it is.

37:43.894 --> 37:44.394
Yeah.

37:44.962 --> 37:47.130
Damn. Wow.

37:47.132 --> 37:49.366
That big [bleep]
was just right here.

37:50.901 --> 37:52.636
Bedded down like this,

37:52.638 --> 37:55.905
watching us come right through
there in the middle of the day.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.807
I've got Bubby down
for an ambush if you will.

37:57.809 --> 37:58.908
I'll guarantee you.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.878
Seeing a bed like this,
this makes me think

38:01.880 --> 38:03.880
that this is
a damn big creature.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.148
<i>We better watch our ass</i>

38:05.150 --> 38:06.716
because there is
where it's staying.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.084
Wonder if this thing

38:08.086 --> 38:09.486
didn't clear all the
leaves out, so whenever...

38:09.488 --> 38:10.420
[branch breaking]

38:10.422 --> 38:12.088
- What was that?
- [Willy] What the hell?

38:12.090 --> 38:13.089
Watch out now! Watch our ass!

38:13.091 --> 38:14.557
[Buck] Right down in there,
right down in there.

38:14.559 --> 38:16.159
- [Bill] Watch your asses.
- [Buck] Stay ready.

38:16.161 --> 38:17.861
Easy does it,
easy does it, damn it.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.630
[Buck] I'm on it with the flir,
I'm not seeing anything yet.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.032
[Bill] What the hell will we do?

38:22.034 --> 38:24.234
I don't want to be packed
in a damn body bag,

38:24.535 --> 38:25.769
I'm damn sure.

38:25.771 --> 38:28.071
<i>We're standing there
looking at that bed.</i>

38:28.073 --> 38:29.839
All of a sudden we're hearing
something just crash

38:29.841 --> 38:30.840
and busting that damn brush.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.009
Stay ready, stay ready.

38:35.379 --> 38:37.414
Might be
that damn Grafton Monster.

38:37.416 --> 38:39.382
[Buck] That sucker was
busting brush, I can tell you that.

38:39.384 --> 38:40.750
He was just
right up here somewhere.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.118
We got to figure out
where the hell is he.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.854
-Hey. Look here. Look here, look here.
-[Willy] What do you got?

38:44.856 --> 38:45.655
[Bill] What? What?

38:45.657 --> 38:47.691
[Buck] Something big
was turning here

38:47.693 --> 38:50.460
Whatever we heard
that's what did this I'd say.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.895
[Willy] Which way do you think
it was heading?

38:51.897 --> 38:54.197
Bill, you're the expert
tracker. Get up here.

38:54.199 --> 38:56.966
- Yes, sir.
- Get here, you hound dog.

38:57.134 --> 38:58.935
[howling]

39:01.238 --> 39:02.539
Now, back to the trail now,
are we?

39:02.541 --> 39:04.674
We're on the trail, brother.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.976
Just right here you can see
it's dry as a bone there.

39:06.978 --> 39:09.012
That's why ain't no print there.

39:09.413 --> 39:10.613
It's shoved up back all in here,

39:10.615 --> 39:12.582
that's knocked out of place,

39:12.584 --> 39:15.051
you can definitely tell that
critter went that away right there.

39:15.053 --> 39:17.420
All right,
we need to take our time.

39:17.422 --> 39:18.888
- All right?
- [Willy] Yeah.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.091
[Buck] We just heard that big
bellow not but 15, 20 minutes ago,

39:21.093 --> 39:23.593
and that Grafton Monster,
we know it's him.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.795
- [Huck] Yeah.
- [Buck] He came busting through the brush,

39:25.797 --> 39:27.731
and now we've got a fresh
track of it going this way.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.899
We're right here
in its home territory

39:29.901 --> 39:32.402
and that Grafton Monster will
kill someone if we're ain't careful.

39:32.404 --> 39:34.003
- [Jeff] Damn right.
- [Willy] Hell yeah.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.405
- Bill, get us on the right track.
- [Bill] Let's go.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.207
[Huck] Get ready guys.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.809
Right here, right here.
Right here.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.411
Right there.

39:41.413 --> 39:42.612
Look right here,
Buck, right here.

39:42.614 --> 39:43.680
[Buck] That son
of a bitch is close.

39:43.682 --> 39:46.282
Look right here,
look here, guys, look here.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.585
- [Buck] Oh, yeah.
- [Bill] He broke that limb off way up there.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.554
The AIMS Team, we got
the best tracker there is.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.089
Damn, right here,
look at this [bleep].

39:53.091 --> 39:54.791
-Look at this.
-[Huck] Come on, Bill. Hell, yeah.

39:54.793 --> 39:55.859
[Willy] Stay right on his ass.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.994
There ain't no way
this Grafton Monster

39:57.996 --> 40:00.263
is getting away from him
big old nose like that.

40:00.698 --> 40:02.766
[sniffing]

40:02.768 --> 40:04.167
Use the super sniffer, Bill.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.771
[Bill] I can smell his ass,

40:07.773 --> 40:09.873
he went that way right there.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.409
Wow, Bill, you're really
into this, ain't you, bud?

40:14.211 --> 40:16.212
Let's go boys! Follow me!

40:22.887 --> 40:23.686
[Bill] What?

40:24.889 --> 40:25.755
He went this way
right here, come on.

40:25.823 --> 40:26.889
Come on.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.992
<i>[Buck] I'm really impressed
with Bill's work.</i>

40:28.994 --> 40:31.528
But if he turns around
and tries to sniff my butt,

40:31.530 --> 40:32.495
I'm outta here.

40:33.697 --> 40:35.432
[Bill] All busted up
right up through here.

40:35.434 --> 40:36.733
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.134
- Right here.
- [Willy] The old Grafton Monster's got

40:38.136 --> 40:39.869
the old hound dog on his ass.

40:39.871 --> 40:40.837
Right here, right here.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.105
[Huck] Stay ready.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.840
[Bill] Hold up,
hold up, hold up.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.008
What's wrong, Bill?

40:45.543 --> 40:46.910
Which way did it go?

40:46.912 --> 40:49.779
That's what I'm trying
to figure out it.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.081
I ain't see [bleep]
right here after this.

40:53.918 --> 40:55.151
It's gone cold.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.886
I don't know, it's not here.

40:56.921 --> 40:58.588
No track anywhere.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.023
<i>We're hot on this track.</i>

41:00.025 --> 41:02.392
All of a sudden,
it went cold as hell.

41:02.394 --> 41:03.960
[Willy] It don't
dead end here, Bill.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.028
- It has to go somewhere.
- [Buck] No way.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.863
You show me another track,
any direction

41:06.865 --> 41:08.731
or a broke stick or anything.

41:08.733 --> 41:10.633
<i>Ain't a sign nowhere,
no leaves kicked up,</i>

41:10.635 --> 41:12.302
broke branches, nothing.

41:12.304 --> 41:13.670
There's gonna be
another track out here, Bill,

41:13.672 --> 41:14.871
look up through here.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.840
It's like this big bastard
just vanished.

41:16.842 --> 41:17.774
<i>There's nothing.</i>

41:17.776 --> 41:19.843
Where the hell
this Grafton Monster go?

41:19.845 --> 41:20.944
All right.
He just didn't disappear.

41:20.946 --> 41:21.778
Let's spread out.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.413
We got to pick up on his trail.

41:23.415 --> 41:25.281
[Huck] He got to be
here somewhere, Bill.

41:25.783 --> 41:27.016
You start looking for tracks.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.685
[Bill] Right here is
the last track, Buck.

41:28.687 --> 41:29.218
- Right there.
- [Buck] Okay.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.420
[Bill] Let's spread out.

41:30.422 --> 41:32.789
Well, he must go this way.
It's the logical, but...

41:32.791 --> 41:34.691
Oh, oh, oh!
Look up here, look up here!

41:34.693 --> 41:35.792
- [Huck] What do we got?
- [Buck] Up on this tree.

41:35.794 --> 41:36.893
[Willy] What do we got?

41:36.895 --> 41:37.994
[Buck] We got claw marks
up on this tree.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.262
- Look.
- Son of a bitch!

41:41.065 --> 41:42.599
It's in the tree, guys.

41:42.601 --> 41:45.101
[indistinct shouting]

41:45.103 --> 41:45.935
[Buck] The leaves
are moving, boys.

41:45.937 --> 41:46.936
He's up there.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.172
Stay ready,
that big bastard be on you.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.607
- Keep your eyes up.
- It's up there.

41:50.609 --> 41:51.875
Watch your asses.

41:51.877 --> 41:54.143
[Jeff] He's airborne, boys.
He's airborne.

41:56.146 --> 41:57.347
The big bastard is up there.
