I thought your book was just - wow!

00:01.823 --> 00:05.061

the big screen. DK adores it.

She's the hottest actress on the
scene.

00:07.023 --> 00:10.461
We already have a director attached -
Leon. What I suggest we do

00:10.462 --> 00:13.461
is that we fly you out to New York
to meet them. Oh!

00:13.462 --> 00:17.341
All I wanted was move to in with you and
try and have a normal relationship.

00:17.342 --> 00:19.701
This is a completely fucked-up
situation.

00:19.702 --> 00:23.502

And for me that means...

00:38.422 --> 00:42.021
Bit of shopping, few laughs. (LAUGHS)

00:42.022 --> 00:45.822

start by putting on a little music.

No, no, no, no, no!
No.

06:37.582 --> 06:40.861
I want to know how you would
deconstruct the client.

06:40.862 --> 06:45.461
I...
And...go!

06:45.462 --> 06:49.541
OK, well, clearly you have a dominant
personality

06:49.542 --> 06:51.541
so I'd want to work with that.

06:51.542 --> 06:54.862
Maybe start off by standing behind
him. Yeah.

06:58.302 --> 07:00.301
It keeps them off guard.
Right.

07:00.302 --> 07:02.781
Now, um...caress him.

07:02.782 --> 07:06.101
Just gently. Very good.

07:06.102 --> 07:08.141
That'll make him excited.

No! No peeking.

07:14.742 --> 07:16.261

When you are showing an Alpha of one
point three,

14:44.643 --> 14:47.322
you come back to me, and at that time
I can guarantee

14:47.323 --> 14:50.242
I will tell you to go fuck yourself.

14:50.243 --> 14:52.603
Yeah, why don't you do that.

14:54.683 --> 14:57.803
Sorry, again, um...

15:02.203 --> 15:06.122
Is it... Is it good? An Alpha of one
point three?

15:06.123 --> 15:08.162
No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...

15:08.163 --> 15:10.162
Are you kidding me?

15:10.163 --> 15:12.802
One point three is fucking amazing!

15:12.803 --> 15:16.242
Sorry, excuse my language.
But it is, like, unheard of.

15:16.243 --> 15:19.602
I'm afraid I don't really understand
what it is you do.

15:19.603 --> 15:23.922
I basically specialise in CTA and
systematic diversified macro investments.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.482
OK, well, that wasn't in English!
Right. Sorry.

15:27.483 --> 15:30.763
Um, I guess you could say I assess
value.

15:33.923 --> 15:38.442
Let's take...you as an example.

15:38.443 --> 15:40.802
You are a commodity.

15:40.803 --> 15:42.722
Oh, thanks.

15:42.723 --> 15:45.202
No, I mean like your services are a
commodity

15:45.203 --> 15:47.962
that you sell for a price, right?
Right.

15:47.963 --> 15:54.322
And your price rises with experience,
exclusivity et cetera.

15:54.323 --> 15:57.562
But you also factor in risk, future
earning capacity,

15:57.563 --> 16:01.042
asset value deterioration
Deterioration?

16:01.043 --> 16:03.682
Yeah, you know, as you get older,

16:03.683 --> 16:06.202
perhaps put on weight, have kids,
wrinkles.

16:06.203 --> 16:08.842
It all detracts from the value.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.162
Oh, that's good isn't it?
That's nice, yeah.

16:11.163 --> 16:13.642
And it's my job to make money

16:13.643 --> 16:16.602
by taking advantage of the tiny
little differences

16:16.603 --> 16:18.802
between what something is actually
worth

16:18.803 --> 16:20.962
and what somebody thinks it's worth.

16:20.963 --> 16:22.962
You see, the secret is to be real
careful

16:22.963 --> 16:25.042
before letting go of what you've got,

16:25.043 --> 16:29.282
because you only really know something's true
value when it's gone. Then it's too late.

16:29.283 --> 16:31.962
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Yes, Mitchell.

16:31.963 --> 16:34.082
I thought you might say that

16:34.083 --> 16:36.843
but unfortunately, the price has just
gone up.

16:38.643 --> 16:41.323
Sorry, do you mind if we, um...?

16:43.043 --> 16:45.483
Oh, no, of course. Come on. Sorry.
