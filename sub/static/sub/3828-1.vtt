<i>Montauk train on track "B."</i>

01:36.261 --> 01:40.595
<i>Random thoughts
for Valentine's Day, 2004.</i>

01:42.000 --> 01:44.935
<i>Today is a holiday invented
by greeting card companies...</i>

01:45.003 --> 01:46.937
<i>Last call...</i>

01:47.005 --> 01:49.496
<i>to make people
feel like crap.</i>

01:52.177 --> 01:54.168
<i>I ditched work today.</i>

01:55.614 --> 01:57.605
<i>Took a train out to Montauk.</i>

01:57.682 --> 02:00.378
<i>Montauk train boarding
on track "B."</i>

02:00.452 --> 02:03.046
<i>I don't know why.</i>

02:03.121 --> 02:06.284
<i>Aah!
I'm not an impulsive person.</i>

02:13.965 --> 02:17.662
<i>I guess I just woke up
in a funk this morning.</i>

02:17.736 --> 02:20.068
<i>I gotta get my car fixed.</i>

02:20.138 --> 02:22.072
Hi. Cindy?

02:22.140 --> 02:24.574
It's Joel. Joel!

02:24.643 --> 02:28.602
Listen, I don't
feel very well today.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.614
No, food poisoning,
I think.

02:30.682 --> 02:34.174
<i>It's goddamn freezing on this beach.</i>

02:34.252 --> 02:36.812
<i>Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.</i>

02:39.591 --> 02:41.525
<i>Page is ripped out.</i>

02:41.593 --> 02:44.118
<i>Don't remember doing that.</i>

02:45.730 --> 02:49.222
<i>It appears this is
my first entry in two years.</i>

02:58.043 --> 03:00.034
<i>Sand is overrated.</i>

03:01.246 --> 03:03.237
<i>It's just tiny little rocks.</i>

03:13.058 --> 03:15.549
<i>If only I could
meet someone new.</i>

03:16.561 --> 03:19.496
<i>I guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished,</i>

03:19.564 --> 03:24.160
<i>seeing that I'm incapable
of making eye contact
with a woman I don't know.</i>

03:25.270 --> 03:28.433
<i>Maybe I should
get back together with Naomi.</i>

03:28.507 --> 03:31.203
<i>She was nice.
Nice is good.</i>

03:33.845 --> 03:35.779
<i>She loved me.</i>

04:13.051 --> 04:15.884
<i>Why do I fall in love
with every woman I see...</i>

04:15.954 --> 04:18.821
<i>who shows me
the least bit of attention?</i>

04:59.097 --> 05:00.928
Hi.

05:00.999 --> 05:02.899
I'm sorry?

05:02.968 --> 05:06.631
- I just said hi.
- Hi. Hello. Hi.

05:07.839 --> 05:10.364
Okay if I sit closer?

05:11.509 --> 05:13.443
How far are you going?

05:13.511 --> 05:15.775
Uh, Rockville Center.

05:15.847 --> 05:18.145
Get out! Me too!

05:18.216 --> 05:21.151
Really?
What are the odds?

05:23.388 --> 05:25.379
Do I know you?

05:27.692 --> 05:30.126
Do you ever shop
at Barnes & Noble?

05:30.195 --> 05:32.322
Sure. Sure.
That's it!

05:32.397 --> 05:34.763
<i>Yeah?
I've seen you, man!</i>

05:34.833 --> 05:38.997
Book slave there
for, like, five years now.

05:39.070 --> 05:42.437
Ah. I would have thought
I would've remembered you.
Jesus! Is it five years?

05:42.507 --> 05:44.600
It might be the hair.

05:44.676 --> 05:46.803
What might?
It changes a lot.

05:46.878 --> 05:50.177
The color.
That's why you might not
recognize me.

05:50.248 --> 05:53.911
It's called Blue Ruin,
the color.
Right. Yeah.

05:53.985 --> 05:56.317
<i>Snappy name, huh?
I like it.</i>

05:56.388 --> 05:58.788
Yeah.

05:58.857 --> 06:01.951
Anyway, this company
makes a whole line of colors
with equally snappy names.

06:02.027 --> 06:06.487
Red... Red Menace,
Yellow Fever,
Green Revolution.

06:06.564 --> 06:09.499
That'd be a job,
coming up with those names.

06:09.567 --> 06:12.502
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

06:12.570 --> 06:16.097
I mean, how many hair colors
could there be? Fifty, maybe.

06:16.174 --> 06:18.199
Someone's got that job.

06:20.345 --> 06:23.314
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.

06:23.381 --> 06:26.282
I apply my personality
in a paste.

06:26.351 --> 06:28.285
Oh, I doubt that very much.

06:28.353 --> 06:30.844
Well, you don't know me,
so...

06:32.057 --> 06:34.048
you don't know, do you?

06:36.895 --> 06:40.296
Sorry. I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.

06:42.133 --> 06:44.124
Yeah. I got it.

07:03.688 --> 07:06.623
My name's Clementine,
by the way.
I'm Joel.

07:06.691 --> 07:09.023
Hi, Joel.
Hey.

07:09.094 --> 07:11.619
No jokes about my name.

07:11.696 --> 07:14.995
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.

07:16.367 --> 07:18.995
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

07:19.070 --> 07:21.231
Huckleberry Hound.

07:21.306 --> 07:23.866
I don't know what that means.

07:23.942 --> 07:27.070
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?

07:27.145 --> 07:29.079
It's been suggested.

07:37.088 --> 07:39.022
No?

07:39.090 --> 07:43.026
I'm sorry. Just...
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.

07:43.094 --> 07:45.085
It's, uh...
It means "merciful."

07:45.163 --> 07:47.097
Right? Clemency?

07:47.165 --> 07:49.360
Although it hardly fits.

07:49.434 --> 07:51.732
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

07:51.803 --> 07:54.237
Gee, I-I wouldn't
think that about you.

07:54.305 --> 07:57.502
Why wouldn't you
think that about me?
I don't know.

07:57.575 --> 07:59.805
I just...

07:59.878 --> 08:02.210
I don't know.
I just, uh...

08:02.280 --> 08:04.214
You seem nice, so...

08:04.282 --> 08:06.307
<i>Oh, now I'm nice?</i>

08:06.384 --> 08:09.547
Oh, God. Don't you know
any other adjectives?

08:09.621 --> 08:11.555
I don't need "nice."

08:11.623 --> 08:15.616
I don't need myself to be it,
and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.

08:18.429 --> 08:20.454
<i>Joel?</i>

08:21.566 --> 08:23.796
It's Joel, right?

08:23.868 --> 08:26.302
Yes.

08:26.371 --> 08:28.805
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

08:28.873 --> 08:32.365
I'm a little out of sorts today.

08:41.019 --> 08:42.953
My embarrassing admission is,

08:43.020 --> 08:45.956
I really like
that you're nice right now.

08:46.024 --> 08:50.859
I mean, I can't tell
from one moment to the next
what I'm gonna like,

08:50.929 --> 08:52.920
but right now...

08:54.065 --> 08:56.056
I'm glad you are.

09:03.274 --> 09:07.438
I have so much stuff
that, uh, I probably should, uh...

09:09.414 --> 09:11.609
Oh! I'm sorry. Okay.
I-I'm writing, and...

09:11.683 --> 09:13.776
No, no. I just...
Sure. No. That's okay.

09:13.852 --> 09:16.446
I just have...
You know, this is...
Okay.

09:16.521 --> 09:18.921
- Ohh! Hey!
- Take care, then.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.981
<i>Jesus!</i>

09:33.938 --> 09:38.238
Hi. I could, uh,
give you a ride, if you need.

09:38.309 --> 09:40.243
<i>It's cold.</i>

09:40.311 --> 09:42.211
<i>Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah?</i>

09:42.280 --> 09:44.180
It is frosty.

09:44.249 --> 09:47.047
<i>You're not a stalker
or anything, right?
I'm not a stalker.</i>

09:47.118 --> 09:49.211
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?

09:49.287 --> 09:51.551
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

09:51.623 --> 09:53.750
Really?
There's a stalker book?

09:53.825 --> 09:56.020
<i>Mm-hmm.
Okay.</i>

09:56.094 --> 09:58.426
I gotta read that one.

10:03.234 --> 10:07.933
Look, I'm sorry if I came off
sorta nutso. I'm not, really.

10:08.006 --> 10:11.407
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.

10:17.348 --> 10:20.112
Did you wanna have a drink?

10:20.184 --> 10:22.379
I have lots of drinks,
and I could, um...

10:22.453 --> 10:24.387
Um...

10:24.455 --> 10:26.389
Never mind.

10:26.457 --> 10:28.823
Sorry. That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No, no, no, no.

10:28.893 --> 10:30.884
Good night, Joel.

10:50.481 --> 10:52.472
<i>Two Blue Ruins.</i>

10:53.484 --> 10:55.281
Thank you.

10:55.353 --> 10:57.287
Drink up, young man.

10:57.355 --> 11:00.153
It'll make
the whole seduction part
less repugnant.

11:03.461 --> 11:05.395
I'm just kidding!

11:05.463 --> 11:07.454
Come on.

11:13.371 --> 11:15.396
You're kinda closed-mouthed,
aren't you?

11:15.473 --> 11:17.407
I'm sorry.

11:17.475 --> 11:21.969
It's just, you know,
my life isn't that interesting.

11:22.981 --> 11:25.643
I go to work, I come home.

11:26.784 --> 11:29.218
<i>Don't know what to say.</i>

11:29.287 --> 11:31.221
You should read my journal.

11:31.289 --> 11:35.783
I mean, it's just... blank.

11:35.860 --> 11:39.091
<i>Really?
Does that make you
sad or anxious?</i>

11:39.163 --> 11:42.496
I mean, I'm always anxious,
thinking I'm not living
my life to the fullest,

11:42.567 --> 11:44.501
taking advantage
of every possibility,

11:44.569 --> 11:48.505
making sure
I'm not wasting one second
of the little time I have.

11:48.573 --> 11:51.064
I think about that.
Yeah?

11:55.513 --> 11:57.447
You're really nice.

11:57.515 --> 12:00.348
Ohh!
God, I have to
stop saying that.

12:02.587 --> 12:04.555
I'm gonna marry you.

12:04.622 --> 12:06.556
<i>I know it.</i>

12:06.624 --> 12:08.785
Um... okay.

12:13.765 --> 12:18.464
Joel, you should come up
to the Charles with me sometime.

12:18.536 --> 12:20.470
It gets frozen this time of year.

12:20.538 --> 12:22.699
That sounds scary.
Exactly.

12:23.775 --> 12:25.709
I'll pack a picnic.

12:25.777 --> 12:28.678
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.

12:28.746 --> 12:30.577
And, um, we could...

12:30.648 --> 12:32.582
Sounds good.

12:33.651 --> 12:36.245
But I... I should, uh, go.
Now.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.254
You should stay.

12:38.322 --> 12:40.552
No, I really... I'm... I...

12:40.625 --> 12:42.559
I have to get up so early.

12:42.627 --> 12:44.561
I would like you
to call me.

12:44.629 --> 12:47.393
Would you do that?
I would like it.

12:47.465 --> 12:49.456
Yes.

12:51.969 --> 12:55.735
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day
when you call!

12:55.807 --> 12:57.672
That'd be nice.

13:38.449 --> 13:40.383
What took you so long?

13:40.451 --> 13:42.385
I just walked in.

13:42.453 --> 13:45.047
Mm-hmm. You miss me?

13:45.123 --> 13:47.353
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.

13:47.425 --> 13:49.359
Oh!

13:49.427 --> 13:52.362
You said "I do."
I guess that means were married.

13:52.430 --> 13:54.364
I guess so.

13:54.432 --> 13:56.900
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?

13:56.968 --> 13:59.402
It's really solid
this time of year.

13:59.470 --> 14:01.335
Whoa! I don't know.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.339
Come on.
Come on.
Eee!

14:03.407 --> 14:05.341
Come on.
Come on, come on.

14:05.409 --> 14:08.845
Whew.

14:08.913 --> 14:12.405
Oh. So beautiful.

14:13.651 --> 14:15.585
<i>Isn't it?</i>

14:18.656 --> 14:20.590
<i>Uh, don't go too far.</i>

14:20.658 --> 14:23.422
- Whoo! Oww! Ow!
- Whoa! Oh!

14:23.494 --> 14:26.691
- Are you okay?
- Ouch! Fuck it.

14:27.765 --> 14:30.461
<i>Ohh! Oh, my ass!</i>

14:32.537 --> 14:35.472
<i>I think I should go back.
Come on. Come on!</i>

14:35.540 --> 14:37.474
What if it breaks?

14:37.542 --> 14:40.477
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?

14:40.545 --> 14:42.706
<i>Come here. Please.</i>

14:42.780 --> 14:44.509
Come on.

14:47.885 --> 14:49.819
Ohh.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

14:49.887 --> 14:52.822
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
Whoa!

14:52.890 --> 14:56.155
This is good.
Here, let me show you
this one thing.

14:56.227 --> 14:58.320
What are you doing?
Whoa.

14:59.797 --> 15:01.731
Come on.

15:07.705 --> 15:09.639
Think I heard a crack.

15:09.707 --> 15:13.473
It's not gonna crack
or break or...

15:13.544 --> 15:15.535
It's so thick.

15:17.215 --> 15:19.809
Show me which constellations
you know.

15:19.884 --> 15:22.478
Um... Oh.

15:22.553 --> 15:25.215
I don't... know any.

15:26.657 --> 15:28.921
Show me
which ones you know.

15:28.993 --> 15:31.393
Okay.

15:31.462 --> 15:34.056
Okay.

15:34.131 --> 15:37.589
Oh. Here's Osidius.

15:37.668 --> 15:39.602
Where?

15:39.670 --> 15:41.604
Right there.
See?

15:41.672 --> 15:44.470
Sort of a swoop
and a cross.

15:44.542 --> 15:46.476
Osidius the Emphatic.

15:48.546 --> 15:50.912
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.

15:50.982 --> 15:53.917
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.

15:53.985 --> 15:57.045
Shut the fuck up!

16:08.199 --> 16:10.133
Clementine.

16:10.201 --> 16:12.431
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

16:15.039 --> 16:16.973
Hey.
Hey.

16:17.041 --> 16:20.101
Hey.
Sorry to wake you,
but we're... here.

16:21.279 --> 16:24.271
Ahh.

16:29.220 --> 16:32.212
Can I come over
to your house...

16:32.290 --> 16:34.952
to sleep?

16:35.026 --> 16:37.893
I'm so tired.

16:37.962 --> 16:40.760
Okay. Um, yeah. Sure.

16:40.831 --> 16:43.732
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah. Oh.

16:46.070 --> 16:48.061
Just...

17:04.588 --> 17:06.579
Yes?

17:07.657 --> 17:11.094
Can I help you?
What do you mean?

17:11.162 --> 17:14.598
Can I help you with something?

17:14.665 --> 17:17.292
No.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.665
What are you doing here?

17:19.737 --> 17:22.262
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

17:22.339 --> 17:24.001
Oh.

17:25.009 --> 17:27.000
Thanks.

19:14.819 --> 19:18.152
<i>We're looking for 159.
What number's that?</i>

19:18.222 --> 19:20.156
<i>I don't know where that is.</i>

19:20.224 --> 19:23.159
<i>Jesus Christ, you'd think
they'd light the number,
or at least put a number on...</i>

19:23.227 --> 19:25.161
<i>Is that him?
I think so.</i>

19:25.229 --> 19:28.323
Yeah, that's him.
Wait. That's him.

19:43.614 --> 19:45.605
<i>Hey, Joel.
Frank.</i>

19:48.419 --> 19:50.512
Oh, shit.

19:50.588 --> 19:55.025
<i>Jesus. The only
Valentine's Day cards I get
are from my mother.</i>

19:55.092 --> 19:57.026
How pathetic is that, huh?

19:57.094 --> 19:59.028
You're lucky
you have Clementine, man.

19:59.096 --> 20:01.030
She is way cool.

20:01.098 --> 20:03.589
Hey, you got any big
Valentine's Day plans with her?

20:06.670 --> 20:08.604
No.

20:08.672 --> 20:11.607
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations
or something.

20:11.675 --> 20:13.802
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's. Right?

20:13.878 --> 20:15.812
McRomance!

20:15.880 --> 20:18.314
You want some fries
with that shake?

20:18.382 --> 20:20.714
I have to, uh,
go to sleep now, Frank.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.945
It's 8:30.

20:50.748 --> 20:53.512
<i>Patrick, stop it.</i>

21:10.701 --> 21:12.794
Ohh! Okay.

21:12.870 --> 21:15.304
Okay. Okay.

21:15.372 --> 21:18.739
Whew. Okay.

21:20.811 --> 21:22.802
<i>Showtime at the Apollo.</i>

21:31.755 --> 21:34.690
Shh, shh, shh. Hey.

21:34.758 --> 21:36.885
Quiet.

21:49.940 --> 21:51.874
<i>Hey, Joel. What's up?</i>

21:51.942 --> 21:53.876
<i>Oh. Hi, Frank.</i>

21:59.450 --> 22:03.216
<i>I only get Valentine's Day cards
from my mom.</i>

22:03.287 --> 22:06.222
How pathetic is that?

22:06.290 --> 22:08.224
You're lucky
you have Clementine, Joel.

22:08.292 --> 22:12.228
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big
Valentine's Day plans with her?

22:12.296 --> 22:14.230
No.

22:14.298 --> 22:16.232
It's only a day away.

22:16.300 --> 22:18.734
Better make a reservation
or something.

22:18.802 --> 22:20.736
Don't wanna end up
at Mickey D's.

22:20.804 --> 22:23.295
<i>Oh, no!</i>

22:23.374 --> 22:26.639
<i>Yes! Valentine's Day
is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.</i>

22:26.710 --> 22:29.838
<i>I'm willing to be
the one to resolve it.</i>

22:29.913 --> 22:33.246
So I call her,
and she's changed her number.

22:33.317 --> 22:36.411
<i>So I walked over to Antic Attic,
you know, to get her something.</i>

22:36.487 --> 22:40.423
<i>I thought I'd go over to work,
give her an early valentine, and...</i>

22:42.126 --> 22:44.060
You won't believe it.

22:44.128 --> 22:46.892
She's there with...

22:46.964 --> 22:50.661
this guy,
this really young guy.

22:50.734 --> 22:54.192
And she looks at me like
she doesn't even know who I am.

22:54.271 --> 22:56.705
Excuse me?

22:56.774 --> 22:59.436
Can I help you
find something, sir?

23:03.380 --> 23:05.314
<i>Hey, Clem-ato.</i>

23:05.382 --> 23:08.442
Patrick! Baby boy.

23:10.788 --> 23:13.723
<i>What you doing here, baby?
Just came to surprise you.</i>

23:13.791 --> 23:16.692
Let me know
if you need something, sir.
You look good.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.694
<i>Hi.</i>

23:18.762 --> 23:21.856
<i>How are you?
Pretty good.
Pretty bored. Pretty tired.</i>

23:21.932 --> 23:23.866
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

23:23.934 --> 23:27.062
<i>I so want what's in your suit.
Oh, good.</i>

23:37.314 --> 23:39.612
Why?

23:39.683 --> 23:42.174
Why would she do that to me?

23:46.590 --> 23:48.581
Hey, does anybody want a joint?

23:48.659 --> 23:51.253
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.

23:51.328 --> 23:53.262
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.

23:53.330 --> 23:55.264
I know, honey.
For being honest.

23:55.332 --> 23:57.596
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.

23:57.668 --> 24:00.603
<i>No! No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.</i>

24:00.671 --> 24:03.037
Get off. It's too...

24:03.107 --> 24:05.041
<i>Right.
Yeah.</i>

24:05.109 --> 24:07.043
I don't want to seem desperate.

24:07.111 --> 24:11.707
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign,
make a clean break. Right?

24:11.782 --> 24:14.910
Right?

24:16.620 --> 24:19.054
<i>All right, Joel,
look, man, seriously.</i>

24:19.123 --> 24:21.057
<i>Rob!
Here's the deal.</i>

24:21.125 --> 24:24.288
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

24:24.361 --> 24:27.524
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?

24:27.598 --> 24:30.123
You're gonna make this
about our shit now?
This isn't about us.

24:30.200 --> 24:34.261
<i>I agree. It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult.
Okay?</i>

24:34.338 --> 24:36.329
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

24:37.641 --> 24:40.576
<i>- What are you...
- That's your laundry!</i>

24:42.045 --> 24:45.537
<i>That's great.
That's good.</i>

24:55.559 --> 24:57.550
Okay.

25:04.501 --> 25:08.767
<i>What is it?
I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.</i>

25:20.584 --> 25:22.677
<i>Good morning. Lacuna.</i>

25:23.687 --> 25:26.679
<i>No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired
after the new year.</i>

25:29.493 --> 25:32.587
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

25:32.663 --> 25:34.961
How about on the fifth?

25:35.032 --> 25:38.433
<i>That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?</i>

25:39.703 --> 25:43.036
<i>Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.</i>

25:43.106 --> 25:46.701
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

25:46.777 --> 25:48.711
May I help you?

25:48.779 --> 25:51.714
<i>I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?</i>

25:51.782 --> 25:55.343
I'm Joel. Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...

25:55.419 --> 25:57.353
Mierzwiak.

25:57.421 --> 26:00.720
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

26:00.791 --> 26:02.782
You still need to
fill the form out, sir.
Really?

26:02.860 --> 26:05.954
- Thank you.
- Great.

26:06.029 --> 26:07.963
I don't have a pen.

26:08.031 --> 26:11.125
There's a pen right there.

26:11.201 --> 26:13.135
<i>Good morning. Lacuna.
Oh.</i>

26:13.203 --> 26:17.071
<i>Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.</i>

26:17.140 --> 26:19.131
Mr. Barish?

26:21.511 --> 26:23.445
How are we today?

26:23.513 --> 26:25.447
Not too good, actually.

26:25.515 --> 26:27.449
<i>Boo!
Oh, my God! Stan!</i>

26:27.517 --> 26:30.452
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!

26:30.520 --> 26:33.819
Sorry. Sorry.

26:33.891 --> 26:35.882
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.

26:36.894 --> 26:38.828
You should not
have seen this.

26:38.896 --> 26:40.887
I apologize.

26:44.768 --> 26:47.202
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...

26:47.271 --> 26:50.104
<i>I assure you, no.
No.</i>

26:55.512 --> 26:58.276
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.

26:59.783 --> 27:02.980
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

27:03.053 --> 27:05.521
so I can't show you evidence.

27:05.589 --> 27:11.323
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

27:11.395 --> 27:13.454
and she wanted to move on.

27:13.530 --> 27:15.464
<i>We provide that possibility.</i>

27:15.532 --> 27:19.593
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy
and wanted to move on.

27:19.670 --> 27:22.195
We provide
that possibility."

27:22.272 --> 27:24.206
What the hell is that?

27:24.274 --> 27:27.209
Nicest guy
she ever went out with.

27:27.277 --> 27:29.211
<i>Oww! Fuck!</i>

27:29.279 --> 27:31.713
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

27:31.782 --> 27:33.716
It's okay.
It's all right.

27:33.784 --> 27:36.480
Carrie, I am making
a birdhouse.

27:38.455 --> 27:42.255
<i>What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.</i>

27:42.326 --> 27:44.123
She's impulsive.

27:44.194 --> 27:47.755
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

27:51.668 --> 27:53.602
A lark.

27:53.670 --> 27:57.106
Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?

28:00.677 --> 28:02.440
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait!</i>

28:02.512 --> 28:05.447
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

28:05.515 --> 28:08.507
Okay. I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time.

28:08.585 --> 28:11.952
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

28:12.022 --> 28:14.957
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.

28:15.025 --> 28:18.586
<i>And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.</i>

28:22.733 --> 28:25.327
Now, the, uh...

28:25.402 --> 28:28.337
the first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

28:28.405 --> 28:30.339
<i>is to go home...</i>

28:30.407 --> 28:35.845
<i>and collect everything you own
that has some association with Clementine.</i>

28:35.912 --> 28:38.142
<i>Anything.</i>

28:39.616 --> 28:43.848
<i>And we'll use these items to create
a map of Clementine in your brain.</i>

28:43.920 --> 28:46.514
<i>Okay?</i>

28:46.590 --> 28:51.653
<i>So we'll need, uh,
uh, photos, clothing, gifts,</i>

28:51.728 --> 28:56.688
<i>books she may have bought you,
CDs you may have bought together,</i>

28:56.767 --> 28:59.395
<i>journal entries.</i>

28:59.469 --> 29:01.232
<i>We want to empty your home...</i>

29:01.304 --> 29:05.638
<i>We want to empty your life
of Clementine.</i>

29:05.709 --> 29:10.203
<i>And after the mapping is done,
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.</i>

29:10.280 --> 29:13.613
<i>That way, when you awake
in the morning,</i>

29:13.683 --> 29:18.120
<i>you'll find yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened...</i>

29:18.188 --> 29:20.679
<i>a new life awaiting you.</i>

29:23.660 --> 29:27.152
Wake up, buddy!

29:31.868 --> 29:34.132
<i>No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.</i>

29:34.204 --> 29:37.367
<i>You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.</i>

29:38.408 --> 29:42.037
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

29:43.146 --> 29:45.774
<i>Hello. I'm right here.</i>

29:45.849 --> 29:50.047
I know it's an emergency,
and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.556
<i>Maybe you could talk to the doctor,
a- and he...</i>

29:53.623 --> 29:57.889
<i>All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like
to come in this week?</i>

29:57.961 --> 30:01.397
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy
this afternoon.

30:01.465 --> 30:05.424
<i>Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?</i>

30:06.436 --> 30:09.371
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

30:16.313 --> 30:18.577
This is, uh, Stan Fink,

30:18.648 --> 30:21.242
<i>one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.</i>

30:23.320 --> 30:25.811
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

30:25.889 --> 30:28.323
Great to meet you,
Mr. Barish.

30:28.391 --> 30:30.325
My name is Joel Barish,

30:30.393 --> 30:34.955
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

30:35.031 --> 30:40.059
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.

30:40.137 --> 30:42.662
Uh, I was...

30:42.739 --> 30:46.539
living with this woman, Naomi,

30:46.610 --> 30:49.170
uh, a couple years ago,

30:49.246 --> 30:54.479
and my friends Rob and Carrie
invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.

30:54.551 --> 30:57.782
<i>Naomi couldn't go, but I went...</i>

30:57.854 --> 31:01.017
<i>and I, uh, met Clementine.</i>

31:01.091 --> 31:04.083
I'm sorry.

31:04.161 --> 31:07.096
Let's start with
your most recent memories...

31:07.164 --> 31:10.759
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.768
There's an emotional core...

31:12.836 --> 31:14.770
to each of our memories,

31:14.838 --> 31:18.604
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process.

31:18.675 --> 31:21.109
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

31:21.178 --> 31:24.909
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

31:24.981 --> 31:27.006
as in a dream upon waking.

31:27.083 --> 31:30.382
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

31:30.453 --> 31:33.445
Well, uh, technically speaking,

31:33.523 --> 31:35.457
<i>the procedure is brain damage,</i>

31:35.525 --> 31:38.358
but it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

31:38.428 --> 31:40.362
Nothing you'll miss.

31:42.566 --> 31:44.830
Comfortable?

31:44.901 --> 31:48.530
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish,
is actually creating a map of your brain.

31:48.605 --> 31:50.937
<i>Okay, let's get started.</i>

31:51.007 --> 31:54.738
<i>If we want to get
this procedure underway tonight,
we have some work to do.</i>

31:54.811 --> 31:58.645
I want you to react
to these objects, Mr. Barish,
if you will.

32:01.318 --> 32:03.752
There's a good story
behind this one...

32:03.820 --> 32:06.755
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish,
I'll get a much better
emotional readout...

32:06.823 --> 32:10.725
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

32:10.794 --> 32:12.728
Just try to focus on the memories.

32:12.796 --> 32:15.356
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

32:17.133 --> 32:21.570
<i>Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts. Very good.</i>

32:21.638 --> 32:24.903
<i>- Here's another object.
- That's so...</i>

32:24.975 --> 32:27.569
Next item. Okay.

32:29.145 --> 32:31.079
Potato head.

32:31.147 --> 32:34.412
Next item. Okay.

32:34.484 --> 32:39.353
<i>Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.</i>

32:39.422 --> 32:42.755
<i>Hey, Patrick,
do me a favor, will ya?
Yeah.</i>

32:42.826 --> 32:46.694
<i>Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?</i>

32:46.763 --> 32:48.697
Uh, voltage looks fine.
Really?

32:48.765 --> 32:52.758
Well, I'm not wiping
as clean as I like here.
I'm...

32:55.705 --> 33:00.836
<i>Well, uh, technically the procedure
is brain damage.</i>

33:02.979 --> 33:05.379
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.

33:07.150 --> 33:09.812
Oh, there you are.
I...

33:15.191 --> 33:19.252
Why am I...
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

33:19.329 --> 33:22.127
Why am I
standing here and...

33:22.198 --> 33:25.031
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.

33:25.101 --> 33:27.194
Déjà vu.
This is so...

33:27.270 --> 33:30.205
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...

33:30.273 --> 33:33.208
underway tonight,
we have some work to do.

33:33.276 --> 33:35.801
I'm in my head already,
aren't I?

33:35.879 --> 33:39.212
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.

33:39.282 --> 33:42.274
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.

33:44.854 --> 33:46.788
Very good.

33:46.856 --> 33:49.120
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

33:49.192 --> 33:52.525
That way you won't be confused later
by their unexplainable presence in your home.

33:52.595 --> 33:54.859
Ah, there we go.

33:54.931 --> 33:56.364
<i>Patrick?
Yeah?</i>

33:56.433 --> 33:59.095
<i>Patrick, can you check...
Patrick?</i>

33:59.169 --> 34:02.627
<i>I'm getting some sort of readout
of my own voice.
Patrick? Patrick?</i>

34:02.706 --> 34:06.608
<i>- Why are there so many wires?
- A lot of equipment.</i>

34:06.676 --> 34:10.476
<i>- Does that help?
- Are you sure
you set that thing up properly?</i>

34:10.547 --> 34:12.481
<i>How's that?
How are you today,
Mr. Barish?</i>

34:12.549 --> 34:14.641
<i>There we are,
Mr. Barish.
That's better.</i>

34:14.717 --> 34:18.051
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.

34:18.121 --> 34:20.021
We're almost done now.

34:20.090 --> 34:23.217
<i>Mmm. Journal.
That would be invaluable.</i>

34:23.293 --> 34:27.389
<i>"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.</i>

34:27.464 --> 34:30.024
<i>Her name is Clementine,
and she's amazing."</i>

34:30.100 --> 34:32.625
Whoa! Jesus!

34:32.702 --> 34:35.637
What? What?
Come on! Careful!
Step back!

34:35.705 --> 34:37.639
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

34:37.706 --> 34:39.538
That's fine.

34:39.609 --> 34:41.440
Let's not roach the guy.

34:44.914 --> 34:46.973
All right, you got that one.

34:47.050 --> 34:50.850
<i>This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?
It's an apartment, Patrick.</i>

34:50.920 --> 34:53.184
Patrick.

34:53.255 --> 34:57.352
<i>Well, not a dump, then,
but sorta plain. Uninspired.</i>

34:57.427 --> 34:59.861
<i>And there's sort of
a stale smell.</i>

34:59.929 --> 35:04.491
<i>Patrick, can we just please
get through this?</i>

35:04.567 --> 35:08.196
<i>We got a very long night
ahead of us. Come on.
Yeah. Yeah.</i>

35:13.143 --> 35:15.703
<i>This is the last time I saw you.</i>

35:30.894 --> 35:32.828
It's 3:00.

35:32.896 --> 35:37.492
<i>I kinda sorta wrecked your car.</i>

35:37.567 --> 35:39.501
<i>Were you driving drunk?</i>

35:39.569 --> 35:41.833
<i>It's pathetic.</i>

35:41.905 --> 35:44.135
<i>I was a little tipsy.</i>

35:44.207 --> 35:46.141
<i>Don't call me pathetic.</i>

35:46.209 --> 35:48.143
Well, it is pathetic.

35:48.211 --> 35:51.146
<i>It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
Oh, God.</i>

35:51.214 --> 35:54.149
<i>Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh, Christ!</i>

35:54.217 --> 35:57.516
<i>Should I check the grill to see
if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!</i>

35:57.587 --> 36:01.455
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.

36:01.524 --> 36:03.958
<i>Well, what are you like?</i>

36:04.027 --> 36:05.961
<i>A wino?
A wino?</i>

36:06.029 --> 36:08.964
Jesus, are you from the '50s
or something?

36:09.032 --> 36:10.966
<i>A wino?</i>

36:11.034 --> 36:13.298
Face it, Joely.

36:13.369 --> 36:17.806
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you,

36:17.874 --> 36:20.809
and in your little wormy brain...

36:20.877 --> 36:24.870
you're trying to figure out,
did she fuck someone tonight?

36:26.483 --> 36:28.417
No, see, Clem,

36:28.485 --> 36:31.079
I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

36:31.154 --> 36:33.588
Isn't that how you get people
to like you?

36:43.399 --> 36:46.835
<i>I'm sorry. Okay?</i>

36:46.903 --> 36:49.736
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?

36:55.245 --> 36:57.179
<i>Clem?
Your keys.</i>

36:57.247 --> 37:00.182
I was just... I was just...
I won't need them anymore.

37:00.250 --> 37:03.344
Angry or annoyed or something,
I don't know.

37:10.059 --> 37:12.050
Clem?

37:14.430 --> 37:17.024
<i>Got it.</i>

37:17.100 --> 37:19.034
Mary's coming over tonight.

37:19.102 --> 37:20.729
<i>Yeah?
Yeah.</i>

37:20.803 --> 37:22.737
<i>Just thought you'd wanna know.</i>

37:22.805 --> 37:25.831
<i>I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.</i>

37:25.909 --> 37:28.469
She likes you okay.

37:28.545 --> 37:31.639
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.

37:31.714 --> 37:34.239
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have...

37:34.317 --> 37:36.251
Yeah.

37:41.224 --> 37:43.658
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

37:43.726 --> 37:45.660
We gotta focus here,
Patrick.

37:45.728 --> 37:47.662
Yeah, the thing is,

37:47.730 --> 37:50.631
our situation is...
is a little weird.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.691
My girlfriend situation.

37:53.770 --> 37:55.567
I'm sure it is.

37:55.638 --> 37:57.629
You gotta be...

38:23.700 --> 38:25.634
Clem, let me drive you home.

38:25.702 --> 38:27.795
<i>Get out of my face, faggot!</i>

38:29.172 --> 38:32.767
<i>Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!</i>

38:32.842 --> 38:35.208
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

38:35.278 --> 38:37.212
You did it to me first!

38:37.280 --> 38:41.273
<i>I can't believe
you did this to me.
Goddamn it.</i>

38:41.351 --> 38:44.286
Clem! Can you hear me?

38:44.354 --> 38:46.948
By morning you'll be gone!

38:47.023 --> 38:50.515
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

38:55.231 --> 38:59.327
<i>Is there something wrong
with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?</i>

38:59.402 --> 39:01.927
<i>No, I think it's... funny.</i>

39:02.005 --> 39:05.099
<i>So, who do you think's better-looking,
me or this guy?</i>

39:05.174 --> 39:07.108
<i>Patrick, let's focus, buddy.</i>

39:07.176 --> 39:09.770
<i>Remember that girl
we did last week?</i>

39:09.846 --> 39:12.974
<i>The one with the... potatoes?</i>

39:14.684 --> 39:18.120
<i>That girl?
That's this guy's girl.</i>

39:18.187 --> 39:20.121
<i>Right.
Yeah.</i>

39:20.189 --> 39:23.124
<i>Was. We took care of that.</i>

39:23.192 --> 39:25.683
<i>Oh, God!
Well, uh...</i>

39:25.762 --> 39:28.629
I kinda fell in love with her
that night.

39:28.698 --> 39:31.633
What? You little fuck...

39:31.701 --> 39:34.693
What?
She was unconscious, man.

39:34.771 --> 39:37.797
Well, she was beautiful, and...

39:37.874 --> 39:40.866
I stole a pair of her panties
as well.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.714
Jesus!
What?

39:45.782 --> 39:47.716
It's not like...

39:47.784 --> 39:50.776
I mean, they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!

39:50.853 --> 39:53.287
<i>They were clean!
What? D-Don't! Stop!</i>

39:53.356 --> 39:55.790
<i>Okay. Yeah! All right!
We got work to do.</i>

39:55.858 --> 39:57.849
<i>Give me my papers.</i>

40:11.307 --> 40:13.741
<i>There's, um...</i>

40:15.111 --> 40:17.102
There's more.

40:18.281 --> 40:21.216
After we did her, I kind of...

40:21.284 --> 40:24.685
<i>went to where she works
and asked her out.</i>

40:26.422 --> 40:28.083
<i>You what?</i>

40:28.157 --> 40:30.785
<i>Jesus.
Jesus, Patrick!</i>

40:31.794 --> 40:34.820
<i>Do you have... any idea...</i>

40:34.897 --> 40:36.728
how unethical...

40:36.799 --> 40:39.734
It's not really that bad.

40:39.802 --> 40:42.532
What? Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

40:42.605 --> 40:45.904
<i>Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!</i>

40:57.220 --> 40:59.211
There's someone here.

41:00.256 --> 41:02.190
He stole your underwear.

41:03.259 --> 41:06.422
I don't see anyone.

41:21.944 --> 41:24.970
<i>Joel?</i>

41:25.047 --> 41:27.447
<i>Where are my boots?</i>

41:27.517 --> 41:30.975
<i>Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?</i>

41:31.053 --> 41:34.045
"Potions," I said.
Potions.

41:39.996 --> 41:42.430
<i>Love potion, please.</i>

41:42.498 --> 41:45.399
I'm fucking crawling
out of my skin!

41:48.538 --> 41:51.029
Should've left you
at the flea market.

41:52.375 --> 41:55.344
<i>First thing to do is...</i>

41:55.411 --> 41:58.403
<i>sift in a cup
of powdered whale heart.</i>

42:03.653 --> 42:05.814
Wanna go?

42:07.190 --> 42:09.124
I want to have a baby.

42:09.192 --> 42:12.093
Let's talk about it later.

42:12.161 --> 42:15.324
No! I want to have a baby.

42:16.465 --> 42:19.400
I don't think we're ready.

42:19.468 --> 42:21.493
You're not ready.

42:21.571 --> 42:24.802
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

42:24.874 --> 42:27.035
What?

42:28.544 --> 42:30.978
I don't wanna
talk about it here.

42:31.047 --> 42:33.811
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand
what you're saying.

42:33.883 --> 42:36.317
I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!

42:36.385 --> 42:38.819
<i>We're fucking
gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to...</i>

42:38.888 --> 42:41.482
You can't just say something like that
and say you don't wanna talk about it!

42:41.557 --> 42:44.492
I'm sorry, Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!

42:44.560 --> 42:48.997
I love children, I'm creative and smart,
and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh, God... Mmm!

42:49.065 --> 42:52.432
<i>It's you, Joel. It's you
who can't commit to anything!</i>

42:52.501 --> 42:56.198
It's going! It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are
I'm interested in you!

42:56.272 --> 42:59.207
Maybe I should end this
right here, Joel!

42:59.275 --> 43:02.642
Leave you at the flea market
with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done. This is crap.

43:02.712 --> 43:06.204
Maybe you could find yourself
an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain, confusion...

43:14.123 --> 43:16.819
Oh. Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

43:16.893 --> 43:19.828
<i>Hey, you.
Oh, it's freezing outside.</i>

43:19.896 --> 43:21.727
<i>Find us okay?
Yeah.</i>

43:25.101 --> 43:27.592
Mmm.
Hot!

43:28.804 --> 43:30.738
Poor guy.

43:30.806 --> 43:33.536
Mmm? Oh.

43:33.609 --> 43:35.839
Don't you have
anything real to drink?

43:35.912 --> 43:38.847
<i>Uh, we haven't really
checked yet.</i>

43:38.915 --> 43:40.849
Patrick?
Uh, yeah.

43:40.917 --> 43:43.317
Uh, let me do the honors.

43:44.620 --> 43:46.554
Mary hates me.

43:46.622 --> 43:49.284
Never really had much luck
with the ladies.

43:49.358 --> 43:51.292
Maybe if you stop
stealing their panties.

43:51.360 --> 43:54.386
<i>Stan. Stan.</i>

43:54.463 --> 43:55.896
There's more.
No!

43:55.965 --> 43:57.262
Yes.
No!

43:57.333 --> 44:01.235
Hey, hey!

44:01.304 --> 44:04.239
Oh, you didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

44:04.307 --> 44:06.901
Uh, no, that's okay.
Wait.

44:06.976 --> 44:11.276
"Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better
even of their blunders."

44:13.349 --> 44:15.283
Oh.

44:15.351 --> 44:17.285
Oh!
Oh!

44:17.353 --> 44:20.117
Mmm!

44:22.124 --> 44:25.560
<i>That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.</i>

44:25.628 --> 44:27.892
<i>I found it in my Bartlett's.</i>

44:27.964 --> 44:29.898
<i>What's your Bartlett's?</i>

44:29.966 --> 44:31.866
It's a quote book, Patrick.

44:31.934 --> 44:33.834
It's a book of quotations.

44:33.903 --> 44:36.394
<i>I think Howard
will be in Bartlett's
one day.</i>

44:36.472 --> 44:38.406
<i>Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.</i>

44:38.474 --> 44:40.840
<i>God!</i>

44:40.910 --> 44:43.470
Can you wake him up?

44:43.546 --> 44:45.480
<i>You can't wake him up.</i>

44:48.718 --> 44:50.709
Mmm.

44:55.057 --> 44:57.048
You don't tell me things, Joel.

44:58.594 --> 45:00.528
I'm an open book.

45:01.764 --> 45:03.698
I tell you everything.

45:03.766 --> 45:06.997
Every damn embarrassing thing.

45:09.605 --> 45:11.698
You don't trust me.

45:11.774 --> 45:15.301
Constantly talking
isn't necessarily communicating.

45:17.747 --> 45:19.738
I don't do that.

45:22.218 --> 45:24.209
I want to know you.

45:25.388 --> 45:27.322
Hmm?

45:27.390 --> 45:30.416
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!

45:32.294 --> 45:34.455
People have to
share things, Joel.

45:34.530 --> 45:36.464
Mm-hmm.

45:36.532 --> 45:38.625
That's what intimacy is.

45:38.701 --> 45:41.636
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

45:41.704 --> 45:43.638
I'm sorry.

45:43.706 --> 45:46.698
It just... really just
isn't that interesting.

45:47.910 --> 45:50.845
<i>I wanna read some of those journals
you're constantly scribbling in.</i>

45:50.913 --> 45:54.076
<i>What do you write in there
if you don't have any thoughts
or passions or...</i>

45:54.150 --> 45:56.141
<i>love?</i>

46:02.958 --> 46:08.021
<i>November 19, 2003.</i>

46:08.097 --> 46:10.759
<i>Dinner at Kang's again.</i>

46:13.169 --> 46:16.104
<i>Are we like those poor couples...</i>

46:16.172 --> 46:18.902
<i>you feel sorry for in restaurants?</i>

46:18.974 --> 46:21.340
<i>Are we the dining dead?</i>

46:21.410 --> 46:26.109
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

46:30.086 --> 46:32.520
I like that.

46:33.856 --> 46:35.790
How's the chicken?

46:35.858 --> 46:37.849
Good.

46:39.295 --> 46:42.230
More?
No. No. Thank you.

46:45.267 --> 46:47.701
<i>She's gonna be drunk
and stupid now.</i>

46:47.770 --> 46:50.204
Hey, would you
do me a favor...

46:50.272 --> 46:53.241
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap
when you're done in the shower?

46:53.309 --> 46:55.243
<i>Yeah. Oh. Yeah.
It's really...</i>

46:55.311 --> 46:57.404
- Gross.
- gross.

46:59.715 --> 47:02.206
- It's just...
- Repulsive.

47:02.284 --> 47:03.945
It's repulsive.

47:09.725 --> 47:12.387
<i>Patrick, can we get through this?</i>

47:12.461 --> 47:14.224
Patrick.

47:14.296 --> 47:16.230
<i>Hey, Tangerine.</i>

47:16.298 --> 47:19.426
<i>Oh, Patrick, it's you.</i>

47:19.502 --> 47:21.766
<i>I'm so miserable right now.</i>

47:21.837 --> 47:24.237
<i>Why? What's wrong?
I don't know.</i>

47:24.306 --> 47:26.240
<i>Excuse me?
I'm so confused!</i>

47:26.308 --> 47:28.242
<i>Can I help you
find something, sir?</i>

47:28.310 --> 47:31.302
<i>Confused? What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.</i>

47:32.314 --> 47:34.248
Baby, come here.

47:34.316 --> 47:36.307
<i>Scared of what?</i>

47:40.389 --> 47:43.415
<i>Do you love me?
Of course I do.</i>

47:43.492 --> 47:45.426
Where's the self-help section?

47:45.494 --> 47:47.962
<i>Do you think I'm ugly?</i>

47:48.030 --> 47:50.464
<i>No! You're beautiful!</i>

47:50.533 --> 47:52.797
<i>Maybe I should come over.
No, no.</i>

47:52.868 --> 47:55.803
<i>I don't know.
I- I'm a mess, Patrick.</i>

47:55.871 --> 47:58.567
<i>Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.</i>

47:58.641 --> 48:00.506
<i>Okay.</i>

48:00.576 --> 48:03.773
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

48:03.846 --> 48:06.041
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's...

48:06.115 --> 48:08.049
Let him go, Stan!

48:08.117 --> 48:11.052
Let him go. I'll help.

48:11.120 --> 48:13.054
<i>See?
How hard can it be?</i>

48:13.122 --> 48:16.819
<i>- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.</i>

48:16.892 --> 48:19.793
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

48:19.862 --> 48:21.557
You like?

48:21.630 --> 48:24.690
Oh, man!

48:24.767 --> 48:26.735
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

48:26.802 --> 48:28.736
<i>I like it.
You do?</i>

48:28.804 --> 48:31.034
You look like a tangerine.
Ohh!

48:31.106 --> 48:34.564
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Mmm! Juicy!

48:34.643 --> 48:37.134
And seedless.
I like that.

48:38.581 --> 48:41.015
I like tangerines!

48:41.083 --> 48:43.244
Can you see me doing ducks?

48:43.319 --> 48:46.220
Tangerine.
Joel. Ducks.
Quack-quack.

48:46.288 --> 48:49.223
How does he know
to call you that?
How did who know?

48:49.291 --> 48:52.055
<i>Oh, my God. Clem?
This is pretty cool.</i>

48:52.127 --> 48:54.061
That's what
they called themselves.

48:54.129 --> 48:56.563
The Clash...
the only band that mattered.

48:56.632 --> 48:58.566
They called themselves that
for a reason.

48:58.634 --> 49:02.001
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice...
Yeah, it's totally incredible.

49:02.071 --> 49:04.596
What Howard
gives to the world.

49:05.608 --> 49:07.701
Yeah.

49:07.776 --> 49:10.210
To let people begin again.

49:12.281 --> 49:14.215
It's beautiful.

49:14.283 --> 49:19.220
You look at a baby,
and it's so pure and so free
and so clean.

49:19.288 --> 49:22.724
And adults are, like,
this mess of sadness...

49:22.791 --> 49:25.589
and... phobias.

49:25.661 --> 49:28.721
Howard just makes it all go away.

49:38.607 --> 49:40.598
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

49:42.378 --> 49:45.313
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!

49:45.381 --> 49:47.781
I'm lost, I'm scared,

49:47.850 --> 49:49.784
I feel like I'm disappearing.

49:49.852 --> 49:52.787
<i>Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!</i>

49:52.855 --> 49:55.790
<i>Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.</i>

49:55.858 --> 49:59.089
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.

49:59.161 --> 50:01.459
Nothing makes any sense.

50:01.530 --> 50:05.159
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay. It's okay.

50:05.234 --> 50:09.261
Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

50:09.338 --> 50:11.272
Montauk?
Yeah.

50:11.340 --> 50:15.037
No! Come up to Boston with me.
Sure. Yeah.
We can go next weekend.

50:15.110 --> 50:18.341
No, no. Now. Now.
Yeah. I have to go now.

50:18.414 --> 50:20.848
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

50:24.420 --> 50:26.854
<i>Hi, it's Joel.</i>

50:26.922 --> 50:32.121
<i>Um, leave a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.</i>

50:34.196 --> 50:36.630
<i>Pick up! Pick up, man!</i>

50:36.699 --> 50:39.497
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

50:41.570 --> 50:44.004
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

50:44.073 --> 50:47.167
<i>I got into a little situation
with the old lady.</i>

50:47.242 --> 50:50.006
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.

50:50.079 --> 50:53.014
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.

50:53.082 --> 50:56.643
He's pretty much on autopilot
right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time.

50:56.719 --> 50:59.449
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

51:01.323 --> 51:03.314
Charles.

51:05.461 --> 51:07.452
Come on, Charles.

51:12.067 --> 51:16.401
"Look! You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.

51:16.472 --> 51:20.670
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want..."

51:22.644 --> 51:25.306
<i>I'm so excited. Yea.
I'm excited too!</i>

51:25.381 --> 51:29.249
Cool.
Oh, uh, I, uh...

51:29.318 --> 51:32.185
I got you this...

51:32.254 --> 51:35.314
<i>What?
thing, um...</i>

51:35.391 --> 51:37.325
Happy early Valentine's Day.

51:37.393 --> 51:39.384
Oh!

51:40.829 --> 51:42.854
Wow. What is it?

51:42.931 --> 51:45.422
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.

51:50.973 --> 51:52.907
Oh.

51:52.975 --> 51:54.909
It... It's gorgeous!

51:54.977 --> 51:57.912
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

51:57.980 --> 52:02.349
I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

52:02.418 --> 52:04.409
Thank you.

52:11.427 --> 52:13.361
Let's go.
Okay.

52:13.796 --> 52:16.697
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?

52:18.333 --> 52:20.858
<i>Am I ugly?</i>

52:20.936 --> 52:24.372
<i>Mm-mmm.
When I was a kid,
I thought I was.</i>

52:24.440 --> 52:28.536
Can't believe I'm crying already.

52:28.610 --> 52:34.446
<i>Sometimes I think people
don't understand how lonely it is
to be a kid.</i>

52:34.516 --> 52:37.542
<i>Like you don't matter.</i>

52:37.619 --> 52:40.952
<i>So, I'm eight...</i>

52:41.023 --> 52:43.287
<i>and I have these toys,</i>

52:43.358 --> 52:45.292
<i>these dolls.</i>

52:45.360 --> 52:50.093
<i>My favorite is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.</i>

52:50.165 --> 52:52.099
<i>And I keep yelling at her:</i>

52:52.167 --> 52:56.501
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

52:56.572 --> 52:58.597
<i>It's weird.</i>

52:58.674 --> 53:01.700
<i>Like if I can transform her,</i>

53:01.777 --> 53:04.405
<i>I would magically change too.</i>

53:09.151 --> 53:11.085
You're pretty.

53:11.153 --> 53:14.316
Joely, don't ever leave me.

53:14.389 --> 53:18.416
Pretty. Pretty.
Pretty. Pretty.

53:18.494 --> 53:22.430
<i>Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.</i>

53:22.498 --> 53:24.432
<i>Just this one.</i>

53:24.500 --> 53:27.435
<i>I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.</i>

53:27.503 --> 53:29.198
Whoo!
Whoa!

53:29.271 --> 53:31.205
Stop it!

53:34.643 --> 53:37.305
I could die right now, Clem.

53:38.547 --> 53:40.538
I'm just...

53:42.351 --> 53:44.512
happy.

53:46.421 --> 53:49.083
I've never felt that before.

53:50.225 --> 53:52.159
Mmm.

53:52.227 --> 53:54.218
I'm just exactly...

53:56.465 --> 53:58.456
where I wanna be.

53:59.535 --> 54:01.526
Clem?

54:07.743 --> 54:10.234
I wanna call it off.

54:10.312 --> 54:12.303
I'll give you a sign.

54:16.652 --> 54:18.643
I wanna call it off!

54:21.056 --> 54:23.991
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!

54:24.059 --> 54:26.425
I wanna call it off!

54:32.467 --> 54:36.233
Is anybody there?

54:42.644 --> 54:45.135
<i>Clementine?
Joel?</i>

54:45.213 --> 54:47.443
<i>Clement...
Joely?</i>

54:47.516 --> 54:49.609
<i>Clem!
Joel?</i>

54:49.685 --> 54:52.483
Clem!

54:52.554 --> 54:54.784
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

54:54.856 --> 54:57.290
What? Where?
I have an idea
of how to stop this.

54:57.359 --> 54:59.691
Stop what?

54:59.761 --> 55:01.695
Joely.
Come on, Clem.

55:01.763 --> 55:05.062
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!

55:05.133 --> 55:07.693
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!

55:07.769 --> 55:09.703
No.
Good.

55:09.771 --> 55:12.137
Concentrate, Clem.

55:12.207 --> 55:14.698
<i>We gotta get back
to the office.</i>

55:14.776 --> 55:17.301
<i>There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.</i>

55:17.379 --> 55:19.404
Not the picture.

55:19.481 --> 55:22.541
Where is it? Back here.
Come on!

55:22.618 --> 55:25.280
<i>Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.</i>

55:25.354 --> 55:29.051
<i>Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,</i>

55:29.124 --> 55:31.058
<i>so I can't show you evidence.</i>

55:31.126 --> 55:34.527
<i>Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski...</i>

55:34.596 --> 55:38.464
<i>was not happy
and she wanted to move on.</i>

55:38.533 --> 55:43.061
<i>Good. Now, tell me about Clementine.
Just tell me everything you remember.</i>

55:43.138 --> 55:46.005
That's what he said. Then...
What did we see that day?

55:46.074 --> 55:48.008
No, wait.
Oh, look! Hey!

55:48.076 --> 55:50.567
Shit!
We're going to see
my grandma.

55:50.646 --> 55:53.342
Joel, why... No, I don't want to...
Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.

55:53.415 --> 55:56.179
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!

55:56.251 --> 55:58.583
Mierzwiak!

55:58.654 --> 56:01.623
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!

56:10.999 --> 56:12.933
Please.

56:13.001 --> 56:16.368
So, why don't we begin
by you telling me...

56:16.438 --> 56:18.531
<i>everything you can remember.</i>

56:18.607 --> 56:21.098
<i>Mierzwiak! Wake me up!</i>

56:21.176 --> 56:24.202
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

56:24.279 --> 56:27.271
<i>I thought you understood
what was going on here.</i>

56:27.349 --> 56:30.512
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.

56:30.585 --> 56:33.520
You're erasing me from her...

56:36.058 --> 56:37.992
I don't know.

56:38.060 --> 56:41.723
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

56:41.797 --> 56:43.731
I'm in my brain.

56:43.799 --> 56:46.700
<i>I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.</i>

56:46.768 --> 56:49.396
How can I help you
from there?

56:49.471 --> 56:52.963
<i>Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.</i>

56:53.041 --> 56:56.670
<i>Sorry.</i>

56:56.745 --> 56:58.804
Look. Who's that?

56:58.880 --> 57:00.939
Oh, he-he works for us.

57:01.016 --> 57:05.680
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

57:05.754 --> 57:08.348
<i>baby boy.</i>

57:08.423 --> 57:10.914
He's stealing my identity.

57:10.992 --> 57:13.392
He stole my stuff.

57:13.462 --> 57:17.159
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

57:17.232 --> 57:20.429
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!

57:20.502 --> 57:22.436
He stole her underwear.

57:22.504 --> 57:25.905
I could die right now, Clem.

57:25.974 --> 57:28.442
I'm just happy.

57:28.510 --> 57:33.106
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where
I want to be.

57:34.649 --> 57:36.640
I want to go home.

57:37.753 --> 57:39.687
Hey. What?

57:42.124 --> 57:45.753
Clem!

57:45.827 --> 57:47.818
Wait. Clem!

57:48.897 --> 57:51.092
Clem?

57:51.166 --> 57:53.634
<i>They're erasing you.</i>

57:53.702 --> 57:55.636
I'm here!

57:55.704 --> 57:58.366
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?

57:58.440 --> 58:00.374
I'm so stupid.

58:00.442 --> 58:03.468
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

58:03.545 --> 58:06.878
<i>I need it to stop before I wake up
and I don't know you anymore.</i>

58:08.517 --> 58:12.749
Okay, well, you know,
just tell them to cancel it then.

58:12.821 --> 58:16.052
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

58:16.124 --> 58:17.887
Wake yourself up!

58:17.959 --> 58:20.723
Okay. You want me to wake up?
Okay. Great. All right.

58:20.796 --> 58:23.697
<i>Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.</i>

58:23.765 --> 58:26.791
I'll try really hard. Here we go.
That was a great idea.

58:26.868 --> 58:28.995
Yeah. Okay.

58:29.070 --> 58:32.301
<i>Boy, that's working
like gangbusters.</i>

58:32.374 --> 58:34.899
<i>Don't! That tickles me!
Oh, my goodness.</i>

58:34.976 --> 58:37.410
<i>Oh, my God. What is that?
Jesus Christ! What the...</i>

58:37.479 --> 58:39.413
<i>It's a birthmark!</i>

58:42.717 --> 58:45.982
It did work, for a second,

58:46.054 --> 58:48.579
<i>but I couldn't...
I couldn't move.
See?</i>

58:48.657 --> 58:53.321
Oh, well, isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

58:53.395 --> 58:55.727
It's more important
to prove me wrong
than to actually...

58:55.797 --> 58:58.960
Look, I don't want to
discuss this right now, okay?

58:59.034 --> 59:02.367
Fine.

59:02.437 --> 59:05.429
Then what? I'm listening.

59:05.507 --> 59:08.203
I don't know.
You erased me.

59:08.276 --> 59:10.938
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this
in the first place.

59:11.012 --> 59:12.946
I'm sorry.
You... You!

59:13.014 --> 59:15.448
You know me. I'm impulsive.

59:18.753 --> 59:20.846
That's what I love
about you.

59:24.626 --> 59:26.150
<i>Joel?</i>

59:26.228 --> 59:29.197
<i>Mm-hmm?
I have another idea
for this problem.</i>

59:29.264 --> 59:31.528
This is a memory of me,

59:31.600 --> 59:36.299
the way you wanted
to have sex on the couch after you
looked down at my crotch.

59:36.371 --> 59:39.306
What?
Joel, the eraser guys
are coming here,

59:39.374 --> 59:42.366
so what if you take me
somewhere else,

59:42.444 --> 59:44.605
somewhere
where I don't belong,

59:44.679 --> 59:47.239
and we hide there
till morning?

59:51.653 --> 59:55.054
Oh, man. I can't remember
anything without you.

59:55.123 --> 59:58.286
Tsk, that's very sweet,
but try, okay?

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.294
Okay.

01:00:24.653 --> 01:00:26.712
It's working!

01:00:26.788 --> 01:00:30.349
<i>I'm a genius!</i>

01:00:50.845 --> 01:00:52.779
<i>Joel?</i>

01:00:52.847 --> 01:00:55.042
Joel?

01:00:56.785 --> 01:00:58.946
<i>Where'd you go?</i>

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.817
I'm supposed to come too!

01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:04.416
<i>Listen, I'm just gonna
go get a salad bowl. Can you stir the soup
and keep an eye on Joel?</i>

01:01:04.492 --> 01:01:06.426
<i>Sure.
He just likes to be near me.</i>

01:01:06.494 --> 01:01:08.462
<i>Absolutely!
Clem?</i>

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:12.694
<i>It worked.
My God, look at this! Wow!</i>

01:01:12.767 --> 01:01:16.931
<i>It worked! Look!
Look at this dress, man!</i>

01:01:17.005 --> 01:01:21.567
Oh, my God! Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.

01:01:21.643 --> 01:01:24.043
Who am I?

01:01:24.112 --> 01:01:26.012
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

01:01:26.081 --> 01:01:28.641
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

01:01:28.717 --> 01:01:32.016
Found the salad bowl,
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

01:01:32.087 --> 01:01:34.578
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?

01:01:34.656 --> 01:01:38.353
God, honestly, I feel like
I could clean up all day.

01:01:38.426 --> 01:01:41.486
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you
to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.

01:01:41.563 --> 01:01:44.088
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.

01:01:44.165 --> 01:01:47.157
<i>Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.</i>

01:01:47.235 --> 01:01:50.363
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.

01:01:50.438 --> 01:01:53.771
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

01:01:53.842 --> 01:01:56.834
<i>Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely! Joely!</i>

01:01:56.911 --> 01:01:59.436
<i>Is every little peanut
under there okay?
Mm-hmm! He's fine.</i>

01:01:59.514 --> 01:02:01.846
Do you have something to drink?

01:02:01.916 --> 01:02:04.578
<i>Would you drink
a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.</i>

01:02:04.652 --> 01:02:07.143
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.

01:02:07.222 --> 01:02:09.952
Okay! I'm just
gonna wait right here.
Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.

01:02:10.025 --> 01:02:11.959
<i>Uh, Joely.</i>

01:02:12.027 --> 01:02:15.656
<i>Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.</i>

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:20.099
<i>Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know,
you've had your dinner.</i>

01:02:20.168 --> 01:02:22.193
<i>Come on, Joel!</i>

01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:24.204
<i>Joel, grow up!</i>

01:02:24.272 --> 01:02:26.638
<i>Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.</i>

01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:29.142
<i>This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.</i>

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:32.509
I want my mommy!
Don't cry, baby Joel.

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:36.880
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!

01:02:36.951 --> 01:02:39.749
<i>Stop it! Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!</i>

01:02:39.821 --> 01:02:42.654
Hey, honey, look.

01:02:42.724 --> 01:02:44.715
Wait there.

01:02:48.096 --> 01:02:50.826
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

01:02:50.899 --> 01:02:52.833
Yuck.

01:02:55.503 --> 01:02:58.995
It stopped.

01:02:59.074 --> 01:03:02.805
What?
It stopped erasing.

01:03:02.877 --> 01:03:05.311
Oh, shit.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.371
This is terrible.

01:03:08.917 --> 01:03:11.215
He's off the map.
He's off the map.

01:03:11.286 --> 01:03:14.847
<i>Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean? I don't know where!</i>

01:03:14.923 --> 01:03:19.019
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

01:03:19.094 --> 01:03:21.654
Okay. Crap.

01:03:21.729 --> 01:03:24.493
Okay. What do we do?
What do I do?

01:03:24.566 --> 01:03:27.126
<i>What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.</i>

01:03:27.202 --> 01:03:29.432
- What shall we do?
- Crap. Crap. I don't know!

01:03:29.504 --> 01:03:32.132
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. What do we do?

01:03:32.207 --> 01:03:35.802
<i>I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.</i>

01:03:35.877 --> 01:03:39.711
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.

01:03:39.781 --> 01:03:42.807
Quiet. You're freaking me out.
Shh. Shh.

01:03:42.884 --> 01:03:45.876
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.

01:03:45.954 --> 01:03:47.888
<i>Oh, shit!
I'm hungry.</i>

01:03:47.956 --> 01:03:49.890
<i>Oh, shit.
Oh! Oh!</i>

01:03:49.958 --> 01:03:52.426
What? Oh! What, what?
What?

01:03:52.494 --> 01:03:55.429
- We should call Howard.
- No way. No, sir, man.

01:03:55.497 --> 01:03:57.658
This is my...
I can handle this.

01:03:57.732 --> 01:04:00.030
<i>I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.</i>

01:04:00.101 --> 01:04:02.797
He's... There's no time
to fuck around.

01:04:02.871 --> 01:04:05.362
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.307
<i>Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.</i>

01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:19.417
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.

01:04:19.487 --> 01:04:23.321
Um, I'm working on this guy
down here, and we seem to have
lost him for a moment,

01:04:23.391 --> 01:04:26.155
and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.

01:04:26.227 --> 01:04:29.663
Okay, uh, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:33.132
Well, I wasn't sure, really,
'cause I was away from the monitor
for a minute...

01:04:33.201 --> 01:04:35.897
and I had it on autopilot
because I had to, uh...

01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:37.904
I had to pee.

01:04:37.972 --> 01:04:41.669
Where's Patrick?
Patrick? Patrick had to
go home sick.

01:04:41.743 --> 01:04:43.677
Ah, geez.

01:04:43.745 --> 01:04:46.509
Okay, what's the address?
I know. I'm so sorry.

01:04:46.581 --> 01:04:50.278
<i>That's okay. Come on.
I'm at 159 South Village.</i>

01:04:50.351 --> 01:04:53.514
<i>Yeah.
Apartment 1 E.
Rockville Center.</i>

01:04:53.588 --> 01:04:56.250
<i>Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?</i>

01:04:56.324 --> 01:04:58.258
<i>I'm staying.</i>

01:04:58.326 --> 01:05:00.692
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.

01:05:00.762 --> 01:05:03.253
I think you should go.
Hell, no.

01:05:03.331 --> 01:05:06.926
Mary... Shit.

01:05:07.001 --> 01:05:10.994
<i>I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.</i>

01:05:11.072 --> 01:05:13.438
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.

01:05:13.508 --> 01:05:16.306
I don't want him
to see me stoned.

01:05:16.377 --> 01:05:20.541
<i>Mary, you have no idea how much trouble
we're gonna get into if Howard comes...
I look like shit!</i>

01:05:20.615 --> 01:05:23.812
<i>Joely, stop it! Joel!
Look! Hey, Joel!</i>

01:05:29.724 --> 01:05:31.715
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.

01:05:31.793 --> 01:05:35.320
It's weird how strong
that desire is.
Joel, look at me! Look.

01:05:35.396 --> 01:05:37.728
You'll remember me
in the morning,

01:05:37.799 --> 01:05:40.962
and you'll come to me,
and you'll tell me about us,
and we'll start over.

01:05:41.035 --> 01:05:43.401
Pat? I just... Pat?

01:05:43.471 --> 01:05:45.632
I thought we could have
a little cocktail.

01:05:45.707 --> 01:05:48.175
That Patrick guy...
he's copying me.

01:05:48.243 --> 01:05:50.234
What Patrick guy?

01:05:50.311 --> 01:05:52.074
That guy!
What?

01:05:52.146 --> 01:05:54.011
He's here in my apartment.

01:05:54.082 --> 01:05:56.016
He's one of those eraser guys.

01:05:56.084 --> 01:06:00.418
He fell for you when they were doing you,
and now he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

01:06:00.488 --> 01:06:02.820
and you guys are dating.

01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:06.121
Really? Is he cute?

01:06:08.529 --> 01:06:10.929
Clem,
there's nothing wrong with you.

01:06:10.999 --> 01:06:13.593
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

01:06:13.668 --> 01:06:16.603
You... You're kind,

01:06:16.671 --> 01:06:18.901
beautiful...

01:06:18.973 --> 01:06:21.203
and smart and funny...

01:06:21.276 --> 01:06:23.506
and... nice.

01:06:23.578 --> 01:06:25.808
What?

01:06:27.048 --> 01:06:29.482
Okay. All right.

01:06:31.019 --> 01:06:33.317
Okay. Oh!

01:06:33.388 --> 01:06:35.686
Move, move, move!
Come on. Let's go.
Careful, careful.

01:06:35.757 --> 01:06:37.554
Fine.

01:06:37.625 --> 01:06:41.026
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.

01:06:41.095 --> 01:06:43.495
Those eyedrops you gave me
didn't do shit.

01:06:48.236 --> 01:06:50.170
Be cool. Cool.

01:06:54.742 --> 01:06:57.040
<i>Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.</i>

01:06:57.111 --> 01:06:59.045
She was just here to help out.

01:06:59.113 --> 01:07:02.276
I wanted to understand as much
as I could about the procedure
as possible.

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:06.047
I think it's important for my job
to understand the inner workings...

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.315
<i>of the work that we do.</i>

01:07:08.389 --> 01:07:11.085
<i>Well, not that I do,
but the work that is done...</i>

01:07:11.159 --> 01:07:14.856
by people... where I also work,
the work of my colleagues.

01:07:14.929 --> 01:07:17.955
All right, well,
let's see if we can, uh,

01:07:18.032 --> 01:07:20.592
get to the bottom of this,
shall we?

01:07:20.668 --> 01:07:22.659
Uh, yeah. Um...

01:07:25.406 --> 01:07:27.874
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.

01:07:27.942 --> 01:07:31.708
<i>Did you try going
through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.</i>

01:07:31.779 --> 01:07:33.576
I mean... yes.

01:07:33.648 --> 01:07:35.878
Yeah.

01:07:38.086 --> 01:07:40.020
All right.

01:07:41.556 --> 01:07:43.490
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.

01:07:43.558 --> 01:07:45.856
All right.

01:07:45.927 --> 01:07:48.555
I already... I ran
the utility programs,

01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:50.620
and I had nothing there,

01:07:50.698 --> 01:07:53.690
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

01:07:53.768 --> 01:07:55.759
<i>Here, Howard.
Okay.</i>

01:07:55.837 --> 01:07:58.237
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.

01:07:58.306 --> 01:08:00.866
You're welcome.
Whew!

01:08:00.942 --> 01:08:04.537
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through
the entire memory,

01:08:04.612 --> 01:08:06.603
<i>see if something comes up.</i>

01:08:13.354 --> 01:08:15.845
I love being bathed in the sink.

01:08:15.923 --> 01:08:18.413
Such a feeling of security.

01:08:18.493 --> 01:08:21.724
I've never seen you happier,
baby Joel.
Hmm!

01:08:21.796 --> 01:08:23.729
There it is.

01:08:23.798 --> 01:08:28.131
I don't understand
why it's off the map like that.

01:08:28.202 --> 01:08:30.261
What the heck
was he doing there?

01:08:39.846 --> 01:08:41.837
<i>His eyes are open.</i>

01:08:43.718 --> 01:08:47.313
<i>- Has this happened before with him?
- No.</i>

01:08:47.388 --> 01:08:50.948
Oh, this is...
this is not good. No.

01:08:51.024 --> 01:08:53.255
I'm gonna have to...

01:08:53.327 --> 01:08:55.261
I'm gonna have to give him this.

01:09:19.687 --> 01:09:22.314
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:25.553
<i>Okay, we're back in.</i>

01:09:25.626 --> 01:09:29.858
<i>Wow. That was beautiful
to watch, Howard.</i>

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:33.957
Like a surgeon
or a concert pianist
or something.

01:09:34.035 --> 01:09:35.969
Thank you, Mary.

01:09:36.037 --> 01:09:40.133
Um, Howard,
you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.

01:09:40.207 --> 01:09:44.770
<i>Why can't you see I love you,
Antoine?</i>

01:09:44.845 --> 01:09:46.837
Hmm. Lucky me.

01:09:46.913 --> 01:09:51.317
Lay one on me.

01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:54.580
Don't call me Antoine.

01:09:54.655 --> 01:09:57.055
<i>My name is Wally.
Yes, I know,</i>

01:09:57.124 --> 01:09:59.684
<i>but how can a woman love a man
with a name like Wally?</i>

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.160
<i>Oh! Oh! What was that?</i>

01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:04.926
<i>Hey.
My God, there's people
coming out of your butt.</i>

01:10:04.999 --> 01:10:07.490
<i>There is?</i>

01:10:08.636 --> 01:10:11.104
- Got it.
- Tangerine!

01:10:11.172 --> 01:10:14.198
What, Joel... What are you doing?
We gotta go.

01:10:14.275 --> 01:10:16.937
Go on. Please, please, go.
Please go!

01:10:19.814 --> 01:10:21.679
You can run,
but you can't hide.

01:10:21.749 --> 01:10:23.546
Clem, come on!

01:10:24.585 --> 01:10:26.519
There I am.

01:10:26.587 --> 01:10:28.521
That truck.

01:10:28.589 --> 01:10:31.490
Doc? Please.

01:10:31.559 --> 01:10:35.689
<i>All right, let's begin
by you telling me...</i>

01:10:35.763 --> 01:10:38.527
everything you remember...

01:10:38.599 --> 01:10:42.501
That's strange.
He's in a memory
that we've already erased.

01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:46.631
Oh, well, at least
we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?

01:10:46.707 --> 01:10:48.641
Come on, Clem.

01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:51.735
<i>He seems to have developed some sort
of resistance to the procedure.</i>

01:10:51.812 --> 01:10:54.406
<i>I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.</i>

01:10:56.450 --> 01:11:00.011
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.

01:11:00.087 --> 01:11:02.817
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.

01:11:03.991 --> 01:11:06.585
<i>Humiliation.
Come on, you big baby!</i>

01:11:06.661 --> 01:11:08.595
<i>I'm sorry, okay?</i>

01:11:12.133 --> 01:11:14.966
<i>Let me drive you home.</i>

01:11:15.036 --> 01:11:17.470
No!

01:11:17.538 --> 01:11:20.996
<i>- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait. Howard.</i>

01:11:21.075 --> 01:11:23.339
He's disappeared again.

01:11:23.411 --> 01:11:27.609
<i>Oh, dear.
I'm so sorry, Howard.</i>

01:11:27.682 --> 01:11:29.673
Humiliation.

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:32.378
Humiliation.

01:11:32.453 --> 01:11:35.445
Hu-mi-lia...
Joel.

01:11:35.523 --> 01:11:37.684
I don't like it either.

01:11:37.758 --> 01:11:40.283
I'm just trying to find
horrible secret places to...

01:11:40.361 --> 01:11:43.330
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just... Oh, um...

01:11:43.397 --> 01:11:46.230
<i>Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.</i>

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:49.133
<i>Good night, sweetheart.</i>

01:11:49.203 --> 01:11:51.535
No.

01:11:51.606 --> 01:11:54.598
<i>I'm sorry, Joel. Joely.
Shut up.</i>

01:11:55.843 --> 01:11:58.710
Look! Joel!

01:11:58.779 --> 01:12:00.713
Joel, look!
What?

01:12:00.781 --> 01:12:02.715
Look where we are!

01:12:02.783 --> 01:12:05.217
Whoo!

01:12:05.286 --> 01:12:07.720
Clem, this isn't good.

01:12:07.788 --> 01:12:11.656
<i>Then hide me somewhere...
somewhere really buried.</i>

01:12:14.428 --> 01:12:17.158
Hit it! Hit it!
I can't! I gotta go home.

01:12:17.231 --> 01:12:19.631
<i>I'll do it later!</i>

01:12:22.803 --> 01:12:26.295
Come on, you big sissy!

01:12:34.582 --> 01:12:36.846
<i>Ooh!</i>

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:40.011
<i>Ooh, he has a girlfriend!</i>

01:12:40.087 --> 01:12:42.749
<i>Wait. What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her!</i>

01:12:42.823 --> 01:12:45.018
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow! Ow!

01:12:45.092 --> 01:12:47.083
Joel!

01:12:47.161 --> 01:12:49.994
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
Hit him! Hit him!

01:12:50.064 --> 01:12:54.626
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la! He's not listening!

01:12:54.702 --> 01:12:56.761
Come on, Joel.
Stupid!

01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:06.744
<i>I'm so ashamed.
It's okay.</i>

01:13:06.814 --> 01:13:09.078
<i>You were a little kid.
Yeah?</i>

01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:11.778
<i>Come on.
That's where I live... lived.</i>

01:13:11.852 --> 01:13:14.116
<i>I wish I knew you
when I was a kid.</i>

01:13:14.188 --> 01:13:17.885
<i>Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.</i>

01:13:17.958 --> 01:13:20.586
<i>It's my turn.
Go. One, two, three.
I can? You're really gonna die though.</i>

01:13:20.661 --> 01:13:22.891
<i>Okay.
One, two, three.</i>

01:13:22.963 --> 01:13:25.454
<i>You're dead.</i>

01:13:25.533 --> 01:13:28.798
<i>Oh, my mom.
It's... It's okay. We're playing.</i>

01:13:28.869 --> 01:13:31.565
<i>Hi, Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.</i>

01:13:31.639 --> 01:13:33.869
<i>Okay, are you dead yet?</i>

01:13:33.941 --> 01:13:36.068
<i>You're dead!</i>

01:13:36.143 --> 01:13:38.077
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.

01:13:38.145 --> 01:13:41.376
I still don't understand it,
but I'm finding him quickly enough.

01:13:55.429 --> 01:13:58.762
<i>Clem!</i>

01:13:59.767 --> 01:14:02.065
Clem!

01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:18.985
Jo... Joely?

01:14:19.053 --> 01:14:21.180
Are you okay, Joel?

01:14:21.255 --> 01:14:23.519
Joel? Joel?

01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:26.458
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.

01:14:26.527 --> 01:14:28.461
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.

01:14:28.529 --> 01:14:32.431
<i>All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.</i>

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.435
Okay.

01:14:43.177 --> 01:14:45.338
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!

01:14:45.412 --> 01:14:47.744
Look at this.
This is so cool!

01:14:47.815 --> 01:14:49.976
Cool. Look out! Look out!

01:14:51.085 --> 01:14:53.019
Ah!

01:14:53.087 --> 01:14:55.078
Shit!
It's fluff.

01:14:56.657 --> 01:14:58.648
Our house!

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:02.155
<i>Come on. Whoo-hoo!
Come on.</i>

01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:04.163
Come on.
We gotta go!

01:15:04.231 --> 01:15:06.825
Whoo!

01:15:06.901 --> 01:15:08.892
Come on!

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:11.870
We gotta go. Clem?

01:15:11.939 --> 01:15:14.840
We gotta go.

01:15:14.909 --> 01:15:16.809
Aah! Come on!

01:15:16.877 --> 01:15:19.072
No!
This is a really bad time
for this!

01:15:19.146 --> 01:15:22.081
Get off me! Oh, God!

01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:25.084
I don't even know
where we're going.
It's gonna be fun. Come on.

01:15:25.152 --> 01:15:27.677
It's the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.

01:15:27.755 --> 01:15:32.385
No, no, no. This way.
You're no help at all.

01:15:32.459 --> 01:15:35.189
What's wrong with you?

01:15:35.262 --> 01:15:38.425
Let go of me, Joel!

01:15:50.444 --> 01:15:52.071
I like watching you work,
Howard.

01:15:56.183 --> 01:15:58.674
I guess, uh...

01:15:58.752 --> 01:16:01.550
I guess I'll go out
for... for some air,

01:16:01.622 --> 01:16:03.613
if nobody minds.

01:16:03.691 --> 01:16:06.888
It looks like you have everything
under control here.

01:16:06.961 --> 01:16:08.895
Yeah, that's, uh...

01:16:08.963 --> 01:16:10.897
<i>that's fine.</i>

01:16:20.608 --> 01:16:23.600
<i>Do you like quotes, Howard?</i>

01:16:24.678 --> 01:16:26.612
What do you mean?

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.376
<i>Oh, you know,
like famous quotes?</i>

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:31.611
I find reading them inspirational,

01:16:31.685 --> 01:16:35.587
and in my reading,
I've come across some
I thought you might like too.

01:16:35.656 --> 01:16:39.319
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.

01:16:39.393 --> 01:16:41.827
<i>There's one that goes,</i>

01:16:41.896 --> 01:16:45.388
"Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better
even of their blunders."

01:16:45.466 --> 01:16:47.400
<i>That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.</i>

01:16:47.468 --> 01:16:50.460
And here I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.
Oh, no.

01:16:50.537 --> 01:16:53.665
It's... It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

01:16:53.741 --> 01:16:56.733
Yeah. Oh, and there's
this other one I like.

01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:59.643
It's by Pope Alexander,
and it goes...

01:16:59.713 --> 01:17:02.181
<i>Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.</i>

01:17:02.249 --> 01:17:04.183
<i>Yeah, shit.</i>

01:17:04.251 --> 01:17:08.085
<i>It's just that I told myself
not to say "Pope Alexander"
and sound like a dope,</i>

01:17:08.155 --> 01:17:10.146
and then I go ahead and say it.

01:17:10.224 --> 01:17:13.751
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.

01:17:15.596 --> 01:17:19.532
<i>The quote goes, "How happy is
the blameless vestal's lot?</i>

01:17:20.768 --> 01:17:23.862
<i>"The world forgetting,
by the world forgot.</i>

01:17:23.938 --> 01:17:28.272
<i>"Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind.</i>

01:17:28.342 --> 01:17:31.903
<i>Each prayer accepted
and each wish resigned."</i>

01:17:31.979 --> 01:17:36.939
<i>I want to be
a great big, huge elephant...</i>

01:17:37.017 --> 01:17:39.485
<i>with a huge trunk like that.</i>

01:17:40.888 --> 01:17:43.823
Clem? Clementine?

01:17:43.891 --> 01:17:46.860
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

01:17:46.927 --> 01:17:49.896
I just thought it would
be appropriate, maybe.

01:17:54.568 --> 01:17:58.231
I really admire
the work you do, Howard.

01:17:58.305 --> 01:18:00.796
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

01:18:00.874 --> 01:18:03.399
I- I- I- I- I...
I'm happy to hear...

01:18:07.181 --> 01:18:10.173
I'm sorry.

01:18:14.221 --> 01:18:16.553
I've loved you
for a very long time.

01:18:19.827 --> 01:18:22.159
<i>I shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.</i>

01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:25.460
<i>It's... You're a wonderful girl.</i>

01:18:25.532 --> 01:18:29.229
But I... You know,
I have a wife and kids.

01:18:29.303 --> 01:18:31.237
You know
I have a wife and kids.

01:18:31.305 --> 01:18:33.239
<i>Oh, Mary.</i>

01:18:35.376 --> 01:18:38.243
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.

01:18:48.255 --> 01:18:50.246
Oh, whoa.

01:18:54.695 --> 01:18:57.960
Well, good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

01:19:05.372 --> 01:19:07.363
<i>What?
Oh, my God!</i>

01:19:07.441 --> 01:19:09.966
<i>Who is it?</i>

01:19:14.381 --> 01:19:16.747
Uh...

01:19:22.423 --> 01:19:25.654
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

01:19:29.396 --> 01:19:32.422
Hollis. Hollis!

01:19:32.499 --> 01:19:34.933
<i>Hollis!</i>

01:19:35.002 --> 01:19:37.163
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.

01:19:38.472 --> 01:19:40.963
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out
to be like this.

01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:44.408
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

01:19:44.478 --> 01:19:46.946
<i>I'm a stupid girl
with a stupid crush!
Yeah.</i>

01:19:47.014 --> 01:19:49.505
I swear I basically
forced him into it!

01:19:50.717 --> 01:19:53.345
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.

01:19:56.023 --> 01:19:58.753
Tell me what?

01:19:58.826 --> 01:20:00.817
Oh, you poor kid.

01:20:01.829 --> 01:20:03.922
You can have him.

01:20:03.997 --> 01:20:05.931
You did.

01:20:14.441 --> 01:20:16.432
What?

01:20:20.247 --> 01:20:22.238
Oh, uh,

01:20:27.254 --> 01:20:30.849
we have a history.

01:20:30.924 --> 01:20:33.484
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.721
You...

01:20:35.796 --> 01:20:38.287
You wanted it done...

01:20:38.365 --> 01:20:41.664
so you could get past, uh...

01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:45.361
You could... Yeah.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:51.800
Um, I have to, uh,
finish the work in there.

01:20:51.879 --> 01:20:53.870
It's almost morning.

01:20:55.082 --> 01:20:57.073
We'll talk later.

01:20:58.085 --> 01:21:00.019
Okay?

01:21:10.998 --> 01:21:12.932
<i>Hey.</i>

01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:18.861
Let me give you a lift home.

01:21:28.448 --> 01:21:31.008
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

01:21:31.084 --> 01:21:34.679
Hi.
Hi.

01:21:34.755 --> 01:21:38.691
Didn't figure you'd show your face
around me again.

01:21:38.759 --> 01:21:41.990
I guess I thought
you were... humiliated.

01:21:42.062 --> 01:21:44.030
You did run away,
after all.

01:21:44.097 --> 01:21:46.861
<i>I just needed to see ya.</i>

01:21:46.934 --> 01:21:49.232
Yeah?

01:21:49.303 --> 01:21:52.033
I'd like to, um,

01:21:52.105 --> 01:21:55.074
take you out or something.

01:21:55.142 --> 01:21:57.702
You're married.

01:21:57.778 --> 01:22:00.212
Not yet. Not married.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.214
No, I'm not married, no.

01:22:02.282 --> 01:22:05.308
Look, man,
I'm telling you right off the bat
I'm high maintenance,

01:22:05.385 --> 01:22:09.947
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage...

01:22:10.023 --> 01:22:12.355
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

01:22:12.426 --> 01:22:15.554
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:17.790
Okay.

01:22:17.864 --> 01:22:20.765
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

01:22:20.834 --> 01:22:23.632
or I'm gonna make them alive.

01:22:23.704 --> 01:22:27.333
But I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for
my own peace of mind.

01:22:27.407 --> 01:22:32.071
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech
really well.

01:22:32.145 --> 01:22:35.637
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole
human race pegged.

01:22:35.716 --> 01:22:37.707
Hmm. Probably.

01:22:39.886 --> 01:22:42.184
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

01:22:42.256 --> 01:22:44.190
even after that.

01:22:44.258 --> 01:22:47.659
Mmm. I know.

01:22:49.997 --> 01:22:51.988
It would be different...

01:22:53.133 --> 01:22:55.533
if we could just give it
another go around.

01:22:59.506 --> 01:23:01.872
Remember me.

01:23:01.942 --> 01:23:03.933
Try your best.

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.214
Maybe we can.

01:23:39.479 --> 01:23:42.414
Okay, so just tell me
what you remember,

01:23:42.482 --> 01:23:45.076
and, uh, then we'll
take it from there.

01:23:45.152 --> 01:23:47.382
Okay.

01:23:47.454 --> 01:23:50.355
I liked you immediately.

01:23:50.424 --> 01:23:52.915
<i>You didn't
come on to me at all.</i>

01:23:52.993 --> 01:23:55.985
<i>I liked that.</i>

01:23:56.063 --> 01:23:59.032
<i>I was so tongue-tied
around you at first.</i>

01:23:59.099 --> 01:24:01.761
<i>I wanted you to think
I was smart.</i>

01:24:02.969 --> 01:24:05.301
I couldn't wait
to come to work.

01:24:05.372 --> 01:24:08.864
I had these fantasies
of us being married...

01:24:08.942 --> 01:24:12.309
and having kids and... just...

01:24:12.379 --> 01:24:15.075
<i>Oh, Howie, I can't do this.</i>

01:24:15.148 --> 01:24:17.742
<i>We agreed it's for the best, Mary.</i>

01:24:17.818 --> 01:24:20.286
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

01:24:20.354 --> 01:24:22.288
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:24:22.622 --> 01:24:24.715
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:26.725
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?

01:24:26.793 --> 01:24:29.284
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...

01:24:29.363 --> 01:24:31.957
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.

01:24:32.032 --> 01:24:33.966
No, no, no, no!

01:24:34.034 --> 01:24:36.195
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.

01:24:36.269 --> 01:24:39.261
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

01:24:41.508 --> 01:24:44.238
<i>This is the day we met.</i>

01:24:44.311 --> 01:24:47.508
<i>You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out
in the distance.</i>

01:24:47.581 --> 01:24:49.708
<i>I remember being drawn to you
even then.</i>

01:24:49.783 --> 01:24:53.913
<i>I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."</i>

01:24:55.689 --> 01:24:58.852
<i>You were in that orange sweatshirt
that I would come to know so well...</i>

01:24:58.925 --> 01:25:00.893
<i>and even hate, eventually.</i>

01:25:00.961 --> 01:25:04.954
At the time I thought,
"How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

01:25:05.031 --> 01:25:07.761
Hi there.

01:25:07.834 --> 01:25:09.768
Hi.

01:25:09.836 --> 01:25:12.771
I saw you sitting over here...

01:25:12.839 --> 01:25:14.773
by yourself,

01:25:14.841 --> 01:25:17.742
and I thought, "Thank God.

01:25:17.811 --> 01:25:20.609
Someone normal
who doesn't know how to interact
at these things either."

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.807
Yeah.

01:25:22.883 --> 01:25:25.909
I don't ever know what to say.

01:25:25.986 --> 01:25:28.716
I'm Clementine.

01:25:28.789 --> 01:25:31.952
Can I borrow a piece
of your chicken?

01:25:32.025 --> 01:25:34.255
And then you just took it...

01:25:34.327 --> 01:25:36.852
without waiting for an answer.

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.891
It was so intimate,

01:25:42.969 --> 01:25:46.097
like we were already lovers.

01:25:46.173 --> 01:25:48.971
I'm Joel.

01:25:49.042 --> 01:25:51.203
Hi, Joel.

01:25:51.278 --> 01:25:54.509
So, no jokes about my name.

01:25:54.581 --> 01:25:59.041
You mean like...

01:25:59.119 --> 01:26:01.610
Huckleberry Hound,
that sort of thing?

01:26:01.688 --> 01:26:03.713
Yeah. Like that.

01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:05.724
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

01:26:05.792 --> 01:26:09.523
One of my favorite things when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

01:26:09.596 --> 01:26:11.587
<i>Oh.</i>

01:26:13.533 --> 01:26:15.865
I think your name is magical.

01:26:18.772 --> 01:26:21.070
This is it, Joel.

01:26:21.141 --> 01:26:23.336
It's gonna be gone soon.

01:26:25.479 --> 01:26:27.811
I know.

01:26:27.881 --> 01:26:29.815
What do we do?

01:26:32.219 --> 01:26:34.710
Enjoy it.

01:26:51.371 --> 01:26:53.669
You married?
No.

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:56.368
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

01:26:56.443 --> 01:26:58.343
I do sort of live
with someone though.

01:26:58.411 --> 01:27:01.778
Male or female?
What?

01:27:01.848 --> 01:27:04.282
Female. Female.

01:27:06.419 --> 01:27:09.911
At least I'm not barking
up the wrong tree.

01:27:12.692 --> 01:27:16.685
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.

01:27:17.697 --> 01:27:19.631
They might have a dog.

01:27:19.699 --> 01:27:23.362
There's no dog.

01:27:23.436 --> 01:27:25.427
What are you doing?

01:27:25.505 --> 01:27:28.770
<i>It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.</i>

01:27:28.842 --> 01:27:31.811
Hoo-hoo!

01:27:31.878 --> 01:27:35.712
<i>- Clementine!
- There we go. Whoo-hoo!</i>

01:27:42.455 --> 01:27:45.049
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:48.253
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.

01:27:50.997 --> 01:27:52.931
It's dark.

01:27:52.999 --> 01:27:56.992
So, uh, what's
your girlfriend's name?

01:27:57.070 --> 01:28:00.301
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...

01:28:00.373 --> 01:28:02.773
We're...
Whatever.

01:28:02.842 --> 01:28:06.938
<i>So this is great.
Now I can look for, um,
candles, matches...</i>

01:28:07.013 --> 01:28:09.481
<i>and the liquor cabinet.</i>

01:28:09.549 --> 01:28:12.814
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:19.255
I think we should go.

01:28:19.326 --> 01:28:21.920
There's no phone line.
What?

01:28:21.995 --> 01:28:24.156
<i>I think we should go.
Why?</i>

01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:26.824
It's our house...
just for tonight.

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:29.869
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

01:28:31.004 --> 01:28:33.438
<i>Which one do you want to be?
Uh...</i>

01:28:33.506 --> 01:28:36.998
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

01:28:38.511 --> 01:28:41.844
What are you do...

01:28:41.915 --> 01:28:44.145
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.

01:28:44.217 --> 01:28:46.811
So, are you okay with wine?

01:28:46.886 --> 01:28:49.548
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.

01:28:49.623 --> 01:28:53.855
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more... Ruth.

01:28:57.263 --> 01:29:00.027
<i>I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.</i>

01:29:01.768 --> 01:29:04.896
I've gotta catch my ride.

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:09.231
<i>So go.</i>

01:29:09.309 --> 01:29:11.402
I did.

01:29:11.478 --> 01:29:14.345
<i>I thought maybe you were a nut,</i>

01:29:14.414 --> 01:29:17.212
<i>but you were exciting.</i>

01:29:18.318 --> 01:29:20.252
<i>I wish you'd stayed.</i>

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.016
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

01:29:23.089 --> 01:29:26.149
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

01:29:26.226 --> 01:29:28.558
Oh, God, I wish I had...

01:29:32.532 --> 01:29:35.660
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

01:29:35.735 --> 01:29:40.297
<i>Well, I came back downstairs,
and you were gone.
I walked out. I walked out the door.</i>

01:29:40.373 --> 01:29:43.206
<i>Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.</i>

01:29:43.276 --> 01:29:46.609
I was like...
It was above my head.
I don't know.

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.614
<i>You were scared?</i>

01:29:48.682 --> 01:29:50.616
Yeah.

01:29:51.651 --> 01:29:54.279
Thought you knew that
about me.

01:29:54.354 --> 01:29:58.347
<i>I ran back to the bonfire,
trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.</i>

01:29:58.425 --> 01:30:02.054
<i>Was it something I said?
Yeah.</i>

01:30:04.831 --> 01:30:07.231
You said, "So go"...

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.768
with such disdain, you know?

01:30:09.836 --> 01:30:12.464
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.</i>

01:30:18.044 --> 01:30:19.978
<i>Joely?</i>

01:30:20.046 --> 01:30:22.913
What if you stayed this time?

01:30:25.585 --> 01:30:28.213
I walked out the door.

01:30:28.288 --> 01:30:30.222
There's no memory left.

01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:33.418
Come back and make up
a good-bye, at least.

01:30:33.493 --> 01:30:35.427
Let's pretend we had one.

01:30:46.539 --> 01:30:49.030
Bye, Joel.

01:30:49.109 --> 01:30:51.043
I love you.

01:30:51.111 --> 01:30:55.377
Meet me in Montauk.

01:30:59.052 --> 01:31:03.250
<i>I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.</i>

01:31:03.323 --> 01:31:07.419
<i>You were operating the plane
with the remote control,
and then it crashed.</i>

01:31:07.494 --> 01:31:09.826
<i>It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.</i>

01:31:09.896 --> 01:31:11.864
<i>You're stoned, and you're driving.</i>

01:31:11.931 --> 01:31:14.491
<i>Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.</i>

01:31:14.567 --> 01:31:17.092
<i>That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking,
then I'll smoke it.</i>

01:31:17.170 --> 01:31:20.799
<i>It does.
That's a medical fact.</i>

01:31:20.874 --> 01:31:23.308
<i>It was proven
on the Science Network.</i>

01:31:23.376 --> 01:31:25.810
<i>Honey, just watch the road.
I can't see shit.</i>

01:31:28.381 --> 01:31:31.373
I saw you talking
to somebody pretty.

01:31:31.451 --> 01:31:34.284
<i>She was nice.
Yeah, man. Who was that?</i>

01:31:36.389 --> 01:31:39.688
She was, um, just a girl.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:50.067
Okay.

01:32:25.572 --> 01:32:28.336
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.

01:32:28.408 --> 01:32:30.501
<i>Thanks, Stan. Thanks.</i>

01:32:30.577 --> 01:32:33.910
We'll talk.

01:33:51.925 --> 01:33:53.916
Hey!

01:33:54.994 --> 01:33:56.928
Hey.

01:33:58.398 --> 01:34:01.128
You got a lot
of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:04.636
<i>I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.</i>

01:34:04.704 --> 01:34:08.435
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.

01:34:08.508 --> 01:34:12.103
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not. God, no.

01:34:12.178 --> 01:34:14.373
And you never even suspected
we were together?

01:34:14.447 --> 01:34:18.679
Once, maybe.

01:34:18.751 --> 01:34:21.743
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car.

01:34:21.821 --> 01:34:24.415
I saw you two talking.

01:34:24.490 --> 01:34:28.221
So I waved to you,
and you giggled, you know.

01:34:28.294 --> 01:34:30.592
How'd I look?

01:34:32.031 --> 01:34:33.965
You looked happy.

01:34:34.033 --> 01:34:36.297
Happy with a secret.

01:34:37.704 --> 01:34:39.638
And after that?

01:34:39.706 --> 01:34:42.869
I never saw you two together
again like that, so I just...

01:34:42.942 --> 01:34:46.639
I don't know. I just figured
I was imagining things.

01:35:05.565 --> 01:35:08.591
<i>Aah!
Montauk train
now boarding on track "B." All aboard.</i>

01:35:11.437 --> 01:35:13.928
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

01:35:15.108 --> 01:35:17.406
You know that?

01:35:27.453 --> 01:35:29.421
Thanks.

01:36:03.056 --> 01:36:05.149
Let me get my toothbrush.

01:36:05.224 --> 01:36:07.692
Yeah. Just...

01:36:20.306 --> 01:36:22.866
<i>Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.</i>

01:36:22.942 --> 01:36:27.311
<i>La-la-la-la-la.
I feel like you're mad at me,
and I don't know what I did.</i>

01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:30.144
<i>What did I do?</i>

01:36:30.216 --> 01:36:32.684
<i>I love you so much.</i>

01:36:32.752 --> 01:36:34.743
<i>I'll do anything
to make you happy.</i>

01:36:34.821 --> 01:36:37.085
<i>Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.</i>

01:36:37.156 --> 01:36:40.922
<i>Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning
just to make sure you're okay.</i>

01:36:40.993 --> 01:36:42.927
Oh. Whew.

01:36:53.739 --> 01:36:56.936
<i>Vámonos, señor.</i>

01:36:57.009 --> 01:37:00.172
I-I had a really nice time
last night.

01:37:00.246 --> 01:37:02.874
Nice?

01:37:02.949 --> 01:37:06.180
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life...

01:37:06.252 --> 01:37:08.186
last night.

01:37:08.254 --> 01:37:10.245
That's better.

01:37:13.359 --> 01:37:17.557
<i>This is weird.
To all patients
of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.</i>

01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:21.122
<i>My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met,
but you don't remember me.</i>

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:25.637
I worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased."

01:37:25.705 --> 01:37:28.230
<i>I have since decided
that this is a horrible...
Some kind of teaser ad or something.</i>

01:37:28.307 --> 01:37:32.869
<i>In order to correct this,
I'm sending everyone's file back to them.</i>

01:37:32.945 --> 01:37:36.540
<i>My name is Clementine Kruczynski.</i>

01:37:36.616 --> 01:37:39.346
<i>I'm here to erase Joel Barish.</i>

01:37:39.418 --> 01:37:41.648
What is this?
I don't know.

01:37:41.721 --> 01:37:46.317
<i>He's boring.
Is that enough reason
to erase someone?</i>

01:37:46.392 --> 01:37:50.089
<i>I've been thinking lately
how I was before and how I am now,</i>

01:37:50.163 --> 01:37:52.097
<i>and it's like he changed me.</i>

01:37:52.165 --> 01:37:55.931
<i>I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.</i>

01:37:56.002 --> 01:38:00.598
<i>I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.</i>

01:38:00.673 --> 01:38:03.870
<i>- That sort of wounded puppy shit
he does, you know?
- What are you doing?</i>

01:38:03.943 --> 01:38:06.377
<i>I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly
fucking off the rose at this point.</i>

01:38:06.445 --> 01:38:09.437
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!

01:38:09.515 --> 01:38:11.949
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!

01:38:12.018 --> 01:38:16.387
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and...

01:38:45.051 --> 01:38:46.985
Patrick, get the fuck away.

01:38:47.053 --> 01:38:49.453
Oh, sweetheart...
Get the fuck away from me!

01:38:49.522 --> 01:38:52.753
Can we talk about it?
No! Get the fuck away!

01:39:25.024 --> 01:39:27.288
Joel Barish.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:30.124
<i>Hey, Clementine.
Hey.</i>

01:39:30.196 --> 01:39:33.427
Nice to see you. Yeah.

01:39:34.433 --> 01:39:36.367
Yeah.

01:39:36.435 --> 01:39:38.426
<i>Really very educated.</i>

01:39:38.504 --> 01:39:41.940
<i>I mean, she's smart, I think,
but not educated.</i>

01:39:42.008 --> 01:39:44.909
<i>I couldn't really talk to her
about books, you know?</i>

01:39:44.977 --> 01:39:48.413
She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.

01:39:48.481 --> 01:39:51.882
<i>Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.</i>

01:39:51.951 --> 01:39:54.613
<i>Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...</i>

01:39:54.687 --> 01:39:56.678
<i>Hi.
because she would pronounce...</i>

01:39:56.756 --> 01:39:59.520
<i>library "libary."
Hi.</i>

01:39:59.592 --> 01:40:02.720
<i>Libary. Libary.</i>

01:40:02.795 --> 01:40:04.729
Look what I found.

01:40:04.797 --> 01:40:09.131
<i>I think if there's
a truly seductive quality
about Clementine,</i>

01:40:09.201 --> 01:40:12.864
<i>it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane.</i>

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.572
<i>You made me look skinny.</i>

01:40:16.642 --> 01:40:19.202
<i>Amazing, burning meteorite...</i>

01:40:19.278 --> 01:40:23.578
<i>will carry you to another world
where things are exciting.</i>

01:40:23.649 --> 01:40:26.675
<i>But what you quickly learn
is that...</i>

01:40:26.752 --> 01:40:29.585
<i>it's really an elaborate ruse.</i>

01:40:29.655 --> 01:40:31.646
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

01:40:33.259 --> 01:40:35.989
<i>It's okay.
So flashy
in a kind of obvious way.</i>

01:40:37.697 --> 01:40:40.257
<i>But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.</i>

01:40:40.333 --> 01:40:42.563
I hate that I said
mean things about you.

01:40:42.635 --> 01:40:47.095
<i>- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.</i>

01:40:48.441 --> 01:40:50.409
<i>Where's the real Clementine?</i>

01:40:50.476 --> 01:40:53.604
<i>I mean, the whole thing with the hair...
it's all bullshit.</i>

01:40:53.679 --> 01:40:56.409
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

01:40:56.482 --> 01:40:58.712
<i>I really like your hair.
Thank you.</i>

01:40:58.784 --> 01:41:00.718
<i>I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.</i>

01:41:00.786 --> 01:41:04.415
<i>Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?</i>

01:41:04.490 --> 01:41:07.220
Do you have any whiskey?

01:41:07.293 --> 01:41:12.595
<i>No, I don't think her sex
is... motivated.</i>

01:41:12.665 --> 01:41:15.657
<i>I saw it clearly
the last night we were together.</i>

01:41:15.735 --> 01:41:19.136
<i>It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.</i>

01:41:19.205 --> 01:41:22.265
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

01:41:22.341 --> 01:41:26.004
<i>The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her...</i>

01:41:26.078 --> 01:41:28.911
<i>is to fuck 'em...</i>

01:41:28.981 --> 01:41:33.213
<i>or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of 'em.</i>

01:41:33.285 --> 01:41:36.220
<i>And she's so desperate
and insecure...</i>

01:41:36.288 --> 01:41:41.123
<i>that she'll, sooner or later,
go around fucking everybody.</i>

01:41:41.193 --> 01:41:44.219
<i>I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that
about you.</i>

01:41:44.296 --> 01:41:47.197
- Because I don't.
- I know.

01:41:47.266 --> 01:41:50.497
<i>Because it really hurts me
that you said that
because I don't do that.</i>

01:41:50.569 --> 01:41:53.663
<i>I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.</i>

01:41:53.739 --> 01:41:58.540
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.

01:42:02.681 --> 01:42:06.344
Um... bye.

01:42:06.419 --> 01:42:09.047
<i>Bye.
I thought I knew her so well.</i>

01:42:09.121 --> 01:42:12.716
<i>It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.</i>

01:42:14.026 --> 01:42:17.393
<i>What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,</i>

01:42:17.463 --> 01:42:21.365
<i>only to find out
that she's a stranger.</i>

01:42:24.670 --> 01:42:26.661
Wait.

01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:30.274
<i>What?
I don't know.</i>

01:42:30.342 --> 01:42:32.503
<i>Just wait. Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?</i>

01:42:32.578 --> 01:42:37.106
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.

01:42:50.663 --> 01:42:53.359
<i>Okay.
Really?</i>

01:42:53.432 --> 01:42:57.562
<i>I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking
for my own peace of mind.</i>

01:42:57.636 --> 01:43:01.572
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything
that I don't like about you.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:04.336
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.

01:43:04.410 --> 01:43:08.039
You know, you will think of things,
and I'll get bored with you
and feel trapped...

01:43:08.113 --> 01:43:10.172
because that's what happens
with me.

01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:13.584
Okay.

01:43:17.289 --> 01:43:19.280
<i>Okay.</i>

01:43:23.395 --> 01:43:26.558
<i>Okay.
Okay.</i>
