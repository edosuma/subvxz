WEBVTT

00:03.534 --> 00:07.007
A MONTH AGO, YOU WERE IN MED
SCHOOL BEING TAUGHT BY DOCTORS.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.280
TODAY...

00:15.346 --> 00:17.017
YOUARE THE DOCTORS.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.350
(woman screaming)

00:19.350 --> 00:21.092
THE SEVEN YEARS YOU SPEND HERE
AS A SURGICAL RESIDENT,

00:21.092 --> 00:23.023
WILL BE THE BEST
AND WORST OF YOUR LIFE.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.695
(grunts)

00:24.695 --> 00:27.098
YOU WILL BE PUSHED
TO THE BREAKING POINT.

00:27.098 --> 00:28.729
AAH!

00:28.729 --> 00:31.031
EIGHT OF YOU WILL SWITCH
TO AN EASIER SPECIALTY.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.134
FIVE OF YOU WILL CRACK
UNDER THE PRESSURE.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.066
TWO OF YOU WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE.

00:35.066 --> 00:37.168
THIS IS YOUR STARTING LINE.

00:37.168 --> 00:39.110
THIS IS YOUR ARENA.

00:39.110 --> 00:41.712
HOW WELL YOU PLAY,

00:41.712 --> 00:43.514
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.389
MER?

00:58.389 --> 01:00.761
(speaking with low volume)
MEREDITH! MEREDITH!

01:00.761 --> 01:03.063
GET UP!
YOU HAVE TO GET UP NOW!
(distorted screaming)

01:03.063 --> 01:05.666
MEREDITH! GET UP!

01:05.666 --> 01:07.168
(distorted screaming continues)

01:07.168 --> 01:10.341
(undistorted screaming)
(grunts) OH, GOD.

01:10.341 --> 01:13.404
(screaming continues)

01:19.150 --> 01:21.652
(screaming continues)
I...

01:21.652 --> 01:23.854
OH.

01:23.854 --> 01:25.856
(grunts) OH!

01:25.856 --> 01:27.458
HOW LONG WAS I OUT?

01:27.458 --> 01:29.420
I DON'T--I...

01:29.420 --> 01:30.861
I DON'T KNOW.
I LOST MY--

01:30.861 --> 01:32.523
I LOST MY SHOE.

01:32.523 --> 01:34.094
(grunts) AAH!

01:34.094 --> 01:35.296
(Meredith groans)

01:42.133 --> 01:46.477
(screaming continues)

01:46.477 --> 01:48.179
WHERE'S--
WHERE'S DEREK AND LEXIE?

01:48.179 --> 01:50.811
I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW.
I LOST A SHOE.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.243
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:52.243 --> 01:54.345
THE PLANE CRASHED,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

01:54.345 --> 01:57.488
WE WERE IN A PLANE,
AND IT CRASHED. PLANE CRASH.

01:57.488 --> 01:58.649
WHERE IS DEREK?!

01:58.649 --> 02:01.121
(screaming continues)

02:01.121 --> 02:03.224
CRISTINA,
WHERE IS DEREK?

02:03.224 --> 02:05.726
HE WAS SUCKED OUT THE SIDE

02:05.726 --> 02:07.228
WHEN WE HIT THE TREES,

02:07.228 --> 02:08.859
AND THEN THE BACK OF THE PLANE
CAME OFF.

02:08.859 --> 02:10.361
IT CAME--IT CAME OFF.

02:10.361 --> 02:12.303
LEXIE WAS IN THE BACK
OF THE PLANE.

02:12.303 --> 02:14.235
I-I LOOKED TO THE BACK, AND ALL
I COULD SEE WAS FREAKIN' SKY.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.367
(screaming continues)

02:16.367 --> 02:18.138
WHERE IS SHE?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.771
I DON'T KNOW!
I ONLY HAVE ONE SHOE!

02:20.771 --> 02:22.173
I'M BLEEDING.

02:22.173 --> 02:24.215
(screaming continues)

02:24.215 --> 02:26.277
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

02:26.277 --> 02:27.418
SHUT UP!

02:27.418 --> 02:28.879
(stops screaming)

02:28.879 --> 02:30.150
(branch snaps)

02:30.150 --> 02:31.882
(tapping in distance)

02:31.882 --> 02:35.256
(Meredith) DO YOU HEAR--
DO YOU HEAR THAT SOUND?

02:35.256 --> 02:37.157
WHERE IS THAT SOUND
COMING FROM?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.890
(tapping continues)

02:39.890 --> 02:41.732
(strained voice) THERE.

02:41.732 --> 02:43.294
IT'S COMING
FROM OVER THERE.

02:43.294 --> 02:46.337
(tapping continues)

02:46.337 --> 02:48.499
(Meredith) DEREK!

02:48.499 --> 02:51.442
(tapping continues)

02:51.442 --> 02:54.305

02:54.305 --> 02:56.607
(Meredith) DEREK! LEXIE!

02:58.579 --> 03:00.751
LEXIE.

03:03.914 --> 03:05.686

03:05.686 --> 03:08.188
(groans)

03:08.188 --> 03:10.190

03:10.190 --> 03:13.824
(panting)

03:13.824 --> 03:15.566
AAH!

03:15.566 --> 03:17.228
OHH.

03:17.228 --> 03:19.330
(gasps)

03:19.330 --> 03:23.274
(breathing rapidly)

03:23.274 --> 03:25.406
IS SOMEBODY THERE?

03:25.406 --> 03:27.608
OH, Y--I'M--I'M HERE.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.780

03:29.780 --> 03:31.442
I'M--I'M STUCK IN HERE.
OH, DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T DO THAT.

03:31.442 --> 03:33.314
I HAVE TO HELP.
STOP. STOP.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.785
(grunts)

03:34.785 --> 03:35.946
I-I CAN'T GET OUTTA HERE.

03:35.946 --> 03:37.748
WH-WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

03:37.748 --> 03:39.250
JERRY.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.252
JERRY, I'M ARIZONA. I DON'T
WANT YOU TO MOVE, OKAY?

03:41.252 --> 03:43.694
'CAUSE YOU COULD--YOU COULD
INJURE YOURSELF MORE.

03:43.694 --> 03:45.526
THE CONTROLS JUST...

03:45.526 --> 03:47.858
I THINK

ALIVE?

03:50.261 --> 03:53.233
UM... YEAH.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.336
YEAH, WE'RE ALL ALIVE.
WELL, I-I...

03:55.336 --> 03:58.309
I-I THINK WE'RE ALL ALIVE.

03:58.309 --> 04:00.841
YOU'RE ALL SURGEONS.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.844
(laughing)

04:08.018 --> 04:09.420
WHAT'S FUNNY?

04:09.420 --> 04:11.582
I AM, UM, I'M MARRIED
TO AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON

04:11.582 --> 04:13.884
AND I'M STARING
AT MY BONE.

04:13.884 --> 04:15.386
(continues laughing)
AND IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT FUNNY.

04:15.386 --> 04:20.030
I-I THINK I'M IN
A LITTLE BIT OF SH-SH-SHOCK.

04:20.030 --> 04:21.392
OKAY.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.364
(continues laughing)
BUT REALLY, I'M FINE.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.865
IT'S OKAY.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.669
(laughing) IF I COULD JUST
GET MYSELF TO STOP LAUGHING.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.441
ARIZONA?

04:30.441 --> 04:32.803
(continues laughing)

04:32.803 --> 04:34.375
YEAH? YEAH?

04:34.375 --> 04:37.448

04:37.448 --> 04:39.410
I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS.

04:39.410 --> 04:40.381
(stops laughing)

04:40.381 --> 04:41.852
(thunder rumbling)

04:41.852 --> 04:45.486
YEAH, I KNEW THAT WAS BAD.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.717
(rumbling continues)

04:46.717 --> 04:48.419
LEXIE. LEXIE.

04:48.419 --> 04:49.660
I KNEW YOU'D SHOW UP.

04:49.660 --> 04:50.821
HOW IS SHE?

04:50.821 --> 04:52.363
SHE'S AWAKE AND RESPONSIVE.

04:52.363 --> 04:54.395
HOW YOU DOING IN THERE?

04:54.395 --> 04:55.996

04:58.829 --> 05:00.000

05:01.432 --> 05:02.833
OHH!

05:02.833 --> 05:04.775
(pants)

05:04.775 --> 05:07.338
SHE'S TACHYCARDIC
AND SHORT OF BREATH.

05:07.338 --> 05:08.739
WE HAVE TO FIND DEREK.

05:08.739 --> 05:10.441
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

POP IT BACK IN.

05:23.394 --> 05:24.355
POP IT BACK IN.

05:24.355 --> 05:25.626

05:25.626 --> 05:27.758
AH. (gasps) WAIT. WAIT.
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

05:27.758 --> 05:29.099
(inhales)

05:29.099 --> 05:30.531
OKAY, DO IT.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.463
(pants)

05:32.463 --> 05:33.964
(cracks)
AAH!

05:33.964 --> 05:36.507
OH, GOD! OH!

05:50.521 --> 05:52.983
DEREK!

05:52.983 --> 05:54.485
DEREK!

05:55.886 --> 05:57.027
MEREDITH?

05:57.027 --> 05:59.059
(voice echoing)
DEREK!

06:06.967 --> 06:08.769
MEREDITH.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.542
(distant voice)
DEREK!

06:11.542 --> 06:12.903
MEREDITH.

06:12.903 --> 06:14.074

06:14.074 --> 06:15.846
(distant and echoing voice)
DEREK!

06:15.846 --> 06:17.448
(pants)

06:17.448 --> 06:18.749
MEREDITH.

06:18.749 --> 06:22.413
(grunting)

06:35.926 --> 06:42.773
(bone crunches)
(Derek, echoing voice) AAH!

06:46.537 --> 06:47.708
(elevator bell dings)

06:47.708 --> 06:48.879
SIR.

06:48.879 --> 06:50.040
HAVE YOU SEEN DR. ALTMAN?

06:50.040 --> 06:51.411
NO, BUT, UM, SIR,
YOU HAVE A FEW MESSAGES.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.182
IS ANYBODY DYING?

06:52.182 --> 06:53.544
NO.

06:53.544 --> 06:54.715
IS IT DR. YANG?

06:54.715 --> 06:55.886
NO.

06:55.886 --> 06:57.117
THEN SEND ALL CALLS
TO VOICE MAIL.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.489
I HAVE MULTIPLE TRAUMAS
COMING IN.

06:58.489 --> 07:00.420
I DON'T HAVE TIME.
AND FIND ME ALTMAN.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.722
ALL RIGHT. WHERE DO YOU
WANT ME, CHIEF?

07:01.722 --> 07:03.053
INCOMING.

07:03.053 --> 07:04.555
BUILDING COLLAPSED ON A BUNCH
OF FIREFIGHTER RECRUITS.

07:04.555 --> 07:07.127
LAST DAY OF THEIR TRAINING.
HAPPY GRADUATION.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.660
OKAY, WELL, YOU HAVE ME
TILL 7:00.

07:09.660 --> 07:12.432
I'VE GOT A DINNER WITH THE LAST
GROUP OF RESIDENTS TONIGHT.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.734
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE SPENDING YOUR WEEK

07:13.734 --> 07:15.536
TAKING THE RESIDENTS
OUT TO DINNER.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.907
AW, COME ON, HUNT.

07:16.907 --> 07:19.169
IT'S A TRADITION.
WE'RE CELEBRATING A MILESTONE.

07:19.169 --> 07:20.611
YOU'RE WELCOME TO JOIN.

07:20.611 --> 07:22.172
I'LL PASS.

07:22.172 --> 07:24.014
OH, I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S
AN EVENING YOU WON'T FORGET,

07:24.014 --> 07:25.516
AND THE KIDS,
THEY JUST LOVE IT.

07:25.516 --> 07:27.017
(scoffs) COULD SOMEONE PLEASE
MERCY KILL ME

07:27.017 --> 07:28.849
SO I DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO THIS THING?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.180
YOU DO ME,
I'LL DO YOU.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.152
BETTER LEAVE ME A BULLET.
HELL IF I'M GOING ALONE.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.854
YANG AND GREY SKIPPED TOWN
AT THE PERFECT TIME.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.626
OH, NO, THEY WILL BE BACK
IN TIME FOR THE DINNER.

07:35.626 --> 07:38.529
BECAUSE I HAD TO PICK UP
THEIR STUPID DRY CLEANING

07:38.529 --> 07:40.661
AND--AND DIG THROUGH
THEIR STUPID CLOSETS

07:40.661 --> 07:41.992
FOR THEIR STUPID HEELS,

07:41.992 --> 07:44.835
ALL THE WHILE BABYSITTING
MER'S STUPID KID.

07:44.835 --> 07:47.498
SHE'S NOT STUPID.
SHE'S ACTUALLY ADORABLE.

07:47.498 --> 07:49.169
HEY, YOU DECIDE
ON TULANE YET?

07:49.169 --> 07:50.541
NO, I'M STILL
WEIGHING MY OPTIONS.

07:50.541 --> 07:52.643
LOT OF FACTORS INVOLVED.

07:52.643 --> 07:54.605
AT LEAST YOU HAVE OPTIONS.

07:54.605 --> 07:56.707
HEY, WANT TO HEAR MINE?
WHEN I GO BACK TO MOLINE,

07:56.707 --> 08:00.050
DO I WORK AT THE TASTEE FREEZ
OR MILK COWS ON THE FARM?

08:00.050 --> 08:01.812
TASTEE FREEZE.
NO-BRAINER.

08:01.812 --> 08:03.213
(sighs)

08:03.213 --> 08:05.616
YOU'RE STILL A DOCTOR.

08:05.616 --> 08:08.559
JUST GO TO TULANE ALREADY.

08:10.561 --> 08:11.562
(Ben) IT'S A THING.

08:11.562 --> 08:13.493
PEOPLE ARE TOGETHER,
BUT THEY LIVE APART.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.825
"LIVE-APARTNERS."

08:14.825 --> 08:16.126
IT'S COMMON ENOUGH
TO HAVE A NAME.

08:16.126 --> 08:17.267
SYPHILIS IS COMMON ENOUGH
TO HAVE A NAME.

08:17.267 --> 08:18.729
DOESN'T MEAN I WANT IT.

08:18.729 --> 08:19.970
WHO DOESN'T WANT WHAT?

08:19.970 --> 08:22.172
(sighs)SOMEBODY
HAS GOTTEN THEMSELVES

08:22.172 --> 08:25.005
A SURGICAL INTERNSHIP
IN LOS ANGELES.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.577
I'M BRANCHING OUT.

08:26.577 --> 08:28.238
CONGRATULATIONS.
(laughs)

08:28.238 --> 08:29.780
OR NOT.

08:29.780 --> 08:32.282
WE WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST
COMMUTER MARRIAGE ON THE PLANET.

08:32.282 --> 08:33.784
(gasps and laughs)
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?

08:33.784 --> 08:35.586
OH, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

08:35.586 --> 08:37.517
OKAY, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.649
I'M GOING.
(siren wailing)

08:38.649 --> 08:41.291
BECAUSE MY LOVE IS STRONG ENOUGH
TO HANDLE THE SPACE.

08:41.291 --> 08:42.923
(woman shouts indistinctly)

08:42.923 --> 08:46.627
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP?
NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.258
(sighs) YOU GONNA GIVE ME
SOME CRAP ABOUT

08:48.258 --> 08:49.930
"ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART
GROW FONDER"?

08:49.930 --> 08:52.232
NO. ABSENCE MAKES THE SEX
GROW HOTTER.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.934
ARIZONA'S ONLY BEEN GONE
FOR ONE NIGHT,

08:53.934 --> 08:55.766
AND ALREADY, SHE'S INSPIRED
A TOTALLY HOT "I MISS YOU THING"

08:55.766 --> 08:57.137
WHEN SHE GETS BACK.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.210
MM-HMM. I HAVE LINGERIE
AND FLAVORED BODY PAINT--

09:00.210 --> 09:01.572
OH, THERE IS A GOD.

09:01.572 --> 09:03.614
(siren whoops)

09:04.715 --> 09:07.317
OKAY, READY? ON MY COUNT.
ONE, TWO...

09:07.317 --> 09:08.679
THREE. (grunting)

09:08.679 --> 09:10.320
(groans)

09:10.320 --> 09:11.852
AGAIN.
(panting)

09:11.852 --> 09:14.184
ONE, TWO, THREE.

09:14.184 --> 09:16.026
(grunting)

09:16.026 --> 09:17.888
(Mark groaning)
(gasps deeply)

MY OTHER ARM,

09:28.639 --> 09:31.902

ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE ASKED ME

10:40.640 --> 10:43.413
IF I KNEW IF YOU WERE TAKING
THE CHIEF JOB AT MEDCOM.

10:43.413 --> 10:45.645
I-I WAS GONNA TELL YOU.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.747
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.679
I'VE ALREADY LOST THE HEAD

11:20.280 --> 11:23.253

11:23.253 --> 11:25.215
THERE'S A TRANSMITTER

11:25.215 --> 11:27.958
THAT LETS OUT A SQUAWK THAT

11:27.958 --> 11:30.190

12:02.452 --> 12:04.955

ON YOUR RIGHT,

12:04.955 --> 12:06.296
BEHIND THE COCKPIT.

12:06.296 --> 12:08.728
THERE'S NO CABINET THERE.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.901
JUST TELL HER TO HANG ON
FOR ANOTHER FOUR HOURS.

12:10.901 --> 12:12.302
GREAT.

12:12.302 --> 12:15.005

12:15.005 --> 12:17.167
(grunts)

12:17.167 --> 12:18.508
(pants)

12:18.508 --> 12:20.410
(Jerry) HEY, HEY, WAIT.
DON'T LEAVE!

12:20.410 --> 12:21.741
I-I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.313
THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M TRAPPED, RIGHT?

12:23.313 --> 12:25.215
I MEAN, I'M GONNA BE
OKAY, RIGHT?

12:25.215 --> 12:26.746
I'M NOT PARALYZED.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.358
I'M SORRY.

12:40.030 --> 12:43.263

12:43.263 --> 12:46.466

12:46.466 --> 12:49.469
CRISTINA.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.902
I CAN'T FIND HIM.
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

12:51.902 --> 12:54.074
I CAN'T FIND HIM.
MAYBE HE'S FINE.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.345
MAYBE HE WENT FOR HELP.

12:55.345 --> 12:57.147
MAYBE, BUT I GOTTA--

18:05.255 --> 18:06.356
SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD FIT.

18:06.356 --> 18:08.558
IT IS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY,

18:08.558 --> 18:10.360

18:12.192 --> 18:13.323
WHERE'S YOUR LOYALTY?

18:13.323 --> 18:17.427

TO SERVE YOUR COUNTRY.

18:17.427 --> 18:21.231
(suction gurgling)

18:21.231 --> 18:24.234
DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE
RIGHT NOW, HUNT?

18:25.575 --> 18:27.677
THIS IS THE ROOM
WHERE MY HUSBAND DIED.

18:27.677 --> 18:30.680
RIGHT HERE

WONDERFUL AND AMAZING

18:34.544 --> 18:37.247
AND MIRACULOUS THINGS
HAPPEN IN THIS ROOM,

18:37.247 --> 18:40.290
IT WILL ALWAYS BE THE ROOM
WHERE MY HUSBAND DIED.

18:40.290 --> 18:41.591
AND THE SOUTH ELEVATOR

18:41.591 --> 18:44.424
WILL ALWAYS BE THE PLACE
WHERE I MET HIM,

18:44.424 --> 18:46.396
AND--AND THE CAFETERIA WILL
ALWAYS BE THE PLACE

18:46.396 --> 18:48.758
WHERE HE BOUGHT MY LUNCH.

18:48.758 --> 18:52.462
I WOULD LOVE TO LEAVE HERE

18:53.733 --> 18:56.336
(voice breaking)
BUT YOU ARE AS BEATEN

18:56.336 --> 19:00.370

19:00.370 --> 19:02.842

19:02.842 --> 19:06.145
AND AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT I HAVE PUT YOU THROUGH,

19:06.145 --> 19:09.579
THE TOLERANCE
AND KINDNESS...

19:09.579 --> 19:12.222
AND FRIENDSHIP
THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN ME,

19:12.222 --> 19:15.225
I AM NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU

19:15.225 --> 19:17.227
BECAUSE OF MY LOYALTY.

19:17.227 --> 19:21.731
I AM NOT GOING TO LEAVE HERE
FOR MEDCOM OR ANYWHERE ELSE.

19:24.364 --> 19:28.398
THIS ISN'T HOLDING.
3-0 PROLENE, PLEASE.

19:33.203 --> 19:35.345
(Meredith) DEREK!

19:36.346 --> 19:37.677
DEREK!

19:37.677 --> 19:40.179
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS KEEPS HAPPENING.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.351
CRISTINA,
WE HAVE TO FIND HIM.

19:41.351 --> 19:42.512
I'M SERIOUS.

19:42.512 --> 19:44.414
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS KEEPS HAPPENING.

19:44.414 --> 19:45.555
WE HAVE TO FIND HIM,

19:45.555 --> 19:46.886
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
HE WENT FOR HELP.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.818
WE KEEP DYING.
WE'RE IN A PLANE CRASH, MER.

19:48.818 --> 19:50.490
LIKE--LIKE RIGHT NOW.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.492
IF HE WENT FOR HELP,
IF DEREK HAD GONE FOR HELP,

19:52.492 --> 19:54.864
HE WOULD'VE SENT A MESSAGE
OR SOMETHING.

19:54.864 --> 19:57.367
I MEAN, WE HAVE TO FIND HIM.
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

19:57.367 --> 19:58.798
I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING.
WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE,

19:58.798 --> 20:01.531
I AM GETTING THE HELL AWAY
FROM SEATTLE GRACE MERCY DEATH,

20:01.531 --> 20:02.902
AND I'M NEVER LOOKING BACK!

20:02.902 --> 20:04.474
(crying) CRISTINA...

20:04.474 --> 20:06.205
I THINK DEREK IS DEAD.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.537
HE WOULD'VE COME FOR US
BY NOW.

20:07.537 --> 20:09.409
HE DEFINITELY WOULD'VE COME
FOR US BY NOW.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.442
I THINK HE'S DEAD.
AND LEXIE'S DEAD.

20:12.442 --> 20:14.684
MY HUSBAND AND SISTER
ARE BOTH DEAD!

20:14.684 --> 20:16.746
AND WE ARE GONNA DIE
OUT HERE, TOO!

20:16.746 --> 20:17.917
WE ARE GONNA DIE OUT HERE--

20:17.917 --> 20:19.649
KEEP IT TOGETHER.
KEEP IT TOGETHER.

20:19.649 --> 20:21.521
NO, YOU KEEP IT TOGETHER!
I'M TRYING!

20:21.521 --> 20:23.693
I KNOW. KEEP--
KEEP IT TOGETHER ANYWAY.

20:23.693 --> 20:26.496
(crying)

20:26.496 --> 20:29.529
(whispers)
KEEP IT TOGETHER ANYWAY.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.731
(sniffles)
MY SISTER IS DEAD.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.263
KEEP IT TOGETHER ANYWAY.

20:33.263 --> 20:35.004
DO YOU THINK
DEREK IS DEAD?

20:35.004 --> 20:36.506
(voice breaking)
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

20:36.506 --> 20:40.370
BUT I'VE GOT P.T.S.D.,
SO YOU KNOW I'M NOT RELIABLE.

20:40.370 --> 20:42.472
CRISTINA...

20:42.472 --> 20:45.275
YOU ARE STILL MY PERSON,

20:45.275 --> 20:47.677
EVEN IF I'M NOT YOURS.

20:47.677 --> 20:49.379
MEREDITH, MEREDITH.

20:49.379 --> 20:50.950
(Derek) MEREDITH.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.924
(panting)

20:54.924 --> 20:57.987
OH, I HEARD YOUR VOICE.

20:57.987 --> 21:00.490
I THOUGHT I--
I THOUGHT I WAS DREAMING.

21:02.031 --> 21:04.734
(gasps)
OH, MY GOD.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.904
(grunts)

21:14.904 --> 21:15.945
OH, I FOUND IT!

21:15.945 --> 21:17.347
THE FIRST AID BOX?

21:17.347 --> 21:18.548
MY SHOE.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.382
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

21:22.382 --> 21:23.813
SHE'S NOT BAREFOOT
ANYMORE.

21:23.813 --> 21:24.954
WELL,
I GUESS THAT'S SOMETHING.

21:24.954 --> 21:26.516
(zips)

21:32.492 --> 21:34.494
(coughs)

21:37.727 --> 21:40.500
(clenched teeth) AAH!
SON OF A--DAMN IT.
I KNOW.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.502
OH, SON OF A--
I KNOW.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.504
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.776
(moans)

21:46.776 --> 21:49.339
(sighs) OKAY.

21:49.339 --> 21:51.781
WHERE'S LEXIE?

21:53.883 --> 21:56.416
(Cristina) CLOTHES.
NO?

21:58.488 --> 22:00.089
OH.

22:00.089 --> 22:02.622
(Cristina speaks indistinctly)

22:04.824 --> 22:07.657
OKAY, LET'S JUST
KEEP IT TOGETHER, OKAY?

22:07.657 --> 22:10.600
(Cristina speaks indistinctly)

22:10.600 --> 22:12.462
CLOTHES.

22:12.462 --> 22:14.464
LOOSEN THE TOURNIQUET
A LITTLE BIT.

22:14.464 --> 22:15.765
YOU'LL BLEED TO DEATH.

22:15.765 --> 22:17.567
I NEED TO SAVE MY HAND.

22:17.567 --> 22:18.708
WELL, I'M TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

22:18.708 --> 22:19.869
OH, SAFETY PIN.
SAFETY PIN.

22:19.869 --> 22:21.771
BRING THAT.

22:21.771 --> 22:23.713
DO YOU HAVE A T-SHIRT
OR A BANDANA?

22:23.713 --> 22:25.044
GOT IT. GOT IT.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.346
(moans)

22:27.346 --> 22:29.619
(groans)

22:29.619 --> 22:33.723
OKAY, WE HAVE TO
CLOSE THE WOUND.

22:33.723 --> 22:35.725
USE THE SAFETY PIN.

22:35.725 --> 22:38.588
WEAVE YOUR WAY
INSIDE AND OUT

22:38.588 --> 22:40.690
AND THEN PUT THE BANDANA
ON TOP OF IT

22:40.690 --> 22:42.031
AND TAPE IT.

22:42.031 --> 22:43.733
AND WHAT'S THE--
WHAT'S THE T-SHIRT FOR?

22:43.733 --> 22:45.765
PUT IT IN MY MOUTH.
I'M PROBABLY GONNA SCREAM A LOT,

22:45.765 --> 22:47.737
AND I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA--
I'M GONNA PASS OUT.

22:47.737 --> 22:48.898
OKAY.

22:48.898 --> 22:50.069
(muffled voice) GOOD.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.642
OKAY.

22:52.642 --> 22:54.043
(muffled screaming)

22:54.043 --> 22:55.505
PLEASE PASS OUT.
PLEASE PASS OUT.

22:55.505 --> 22:57.647
PLEASE PASS OUT.
PLEASE PASS OUT.

22:57.647 --> 22:59.479

PLEASE PASS OUT.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.051
PLEASE PASS OUT.
PLEASE PASS OUT.

23:02.051 --> 23:03.653
(Richard) KEPNER,
YOU'LL HAVE TO CLOSE UP FOR ME.

23:03.653 --> 23:05.555
I HAVE TO PREORDER OUR DUCK--

23:05.555 --> 23:07.487
UH, SLOW-ROASTED,

23:07.487 --> 23:09.519
IT TAKES SIX HOURS,
FALLS OFF THE BONE.

23:09.519 --> 23:12.391
OH, THE RESIDENCY DINNER.
CAN I COME?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.494
OH, YOU'VE HAD YOUR TURN.
NOW IT'S THEIRS.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.825
YOU KIDS JAZZED
ABOUT DINNER?

23:15.825 --> 23:17.527
YES, SIR.

23:17.527 --> 23:18.698
YEAH?

23:18.698 --> 23:20.830
OH, VERY JAZZED.

23:20.830 --> 23:22.432
YUM.
(laughs)

23:22.432 --> 23:24.974
WELL, CALL ME MILES DAVIS,
'CAUSE I'M JAZZED.

23:24.974 --> 23:26.976
(monitor beeping steadily)

23:26.976 --> 23:29.178
(door hisses open)

23:29.178 --> 23:32.081
I'LL GIVE YOU 10 BUCKS TO
STAB ME IN THE FACE RIGHT NOW.

23:32.081 --> 23:33.443
(laughs)

23:33.443 --> 23:35.645
(laughs)

23:35.645 --> 23:37.146
(clicks)

23:40.550 --> 23:43.553
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

23:47.627 --> 23:49.829
HEY.

23:52.031 --> 23:55.735
NOW I KNOW WHY YOU WERE
TRYING SO HARD TO KEEP HER HERE.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.467
(sighs)

23:57.467 --> 24:00.740
IF CRISTINA WERE STAYING,
YOU'D BE TAKING THAT JOB.

24:03.713 --> 24:05.014
I'LL BE FINE.

24:05.014 --> 24:07.076
NO, NO, OWEN,
YOU WON'T.

24:07.076 --> 24:09.719
YOU ARE LOSING
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

24:11.220 --> 24:13.222
(sighs) YEAH.

24:13.222 --> 24:15.525
EVERYWHERE I LOOK,
I EXPECT TO SEE HER.

24:15.525 --> 24:16.626
(sighs)

24:16.626 --> 24:19.759
SHE'S NOT EVEN GONE,
AND I MISS HER ALREADY.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.693
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU
THAT WILL GO AWAY,

24:23.693 --> 24:25.735
BUT IT WON'T.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.171
MATCHES. YES, GOD.
FINALLY.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.643
FIRE. WE CAN BUILD
A FIRE.

24:33.643 --> 24:34.704
(Meredith) WE SHOULD.
THEY'LL SEE A FIRE.

24:34.704 --> 24:36.576
LET'S GET A FIRE STARTED.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.008
YEAH, MARK. WE NEED--
WE NEED TO START A FIRE.

24:39.008 --> 24:42.552
MARK. MARK.

24:42.552 --> 24:44.113
YOU HAVE TO HELP.
(grunts)

24:44.113 --> 24:45.815
I-I'LL FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET IT STARTED.
NO, NO.

24:45.815 --> 24:47.116
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE DOESN'T GET TO DO THIS.

24:47.116 --> 24:48.658
HE DOESN'T GET
TO STOP HELPING.

24:48.658 --> 24:50.720
I'M SORRY HE LOST LEXIE,

24:50.720 --> 24:52.762
BUT SHE WAS YOUR SISTER,
AND YOU'RE STILL HELPING.

24:52.762 --> 24:55.094
HE HAS TO HELP BECAUSE THE SKY
IS FALLING, MARK.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.125
CRISTINA.

24:56.125 --> 24:57.727
NO, NO, NO.

24:57.727 --> 24:59.899
YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S
ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED

24:59.899 --> 25:02.632
WITH ALL THE--THE BOMBS
AND THE GUNS TO MY HEAD

25:02.632 --> 25:04.774
AND--AND THE BUSES
RUNNING DOWN MY FRIENDS

25:04.774 --> 25:06.776
IS THAT I AM NOT INTERESTED
IN DYING.

25:06.776 --> 25:09.939
I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE,
AND I WANT TO GO HOME.

25:09.939 --> 25:11.681
AND EVERYONE HAS TO HELP.

25:11.681 --> 25:13.583
MARK, GET UP.

25:13.583 --> 25:14.884
GET UP AND HELP, MARK.

25:14.884 --> 25:17.717
GET UP.

25:18.918 --> 25:22.792
MARK? MARK? MARK?

25:22.792 --> 25:24.093
MARK.

25:24.093 --> 25:26.525
PLEASE.
PLEASE BE OKAY.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.897
(panting)

25:27.897 --> 25:29.128
MARK.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.630
OH!

25:30.630 --> 25:32.261
OH, CRAP.

25:32.261 --> 25:34.233
MER!

25:41.741 --> 25:43.743
WHAT HAPPENED?

25:43.743 --> 25:45.615
WHEN I RECHECKED HIM, HE HAD
MUFFLED HEART SOUNDS AND J.V.D.
DELAYED TAMPONADE?

25:47.176 --> 25:48.578
IT'S A CARDIAC TAMPONADE.

25:48.578 --> 25:49.849
ARE YOU SURE?

25:49.849 --> 25:51.651
75%.

25:51.651 --> 25:54.253
70%. 70% SURE.
THAT'S NOT VERY SURE.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.255
WELL, IF YOU WANT ME TO BE SURE,
GET ME AN ULTRASOUND.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.627
WILL YOU MAN THE ULTRASOUND?

25:57.627 --> 25:58.788
MM-HMM.

26:00.790 --> 26:02.732
THANK YOU.

26:04.864 --> 26:07.336
LOOKS LIKE THE PERICARDIUM'S
ABOUT TO BURST.

26:07.336 --> 26:09.639
WE HAVE TO DRAIN
HIS PERICARDIAL SAC

26:09.639 --> 26:11.100
AND RELIEVE THE PRESSURE,
OR--OR HIS HEART WILL STOP.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.802
WITH WHAT?

26:12.802 --> 26:14.804
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE
AN 18-GUAGE SPINAL NEEDLE.
I DON'T KNOW.

26:14.804 --> 26:16.646
ALL RIGHT. 18 GAUGE.

26:18.147 --> 26:20.279
OKAY, I GOT IT. OKAY.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.111
HOLD THIS.
TAKE THE TOP OFF.

26:22.111 --> 26:23.282
OKAY. WHY?

26:23.282 --> 26:24.253
USE THAT RIGHT THERE.

26:24.253 --> 26:25.915
OHH.
USE THE TUBE.

26:25.915 --> 26:27.186
BRILLIANT. BRILLIANT.
OKAY, THIS WILL WORK.
ALL RIGHT. SURE.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.988
SANITIZE THAT.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.159
(spritzing)

26:30.159 --> 26:33.162
(ultrasound whooshing)

26:36.225 --> 26:37.366
IS THE TUBING LONG ENOUGH?

26:37.366 --> 26:40.329
I'M GOING IN,
UM, SUBXIPHOID. KNIFE.

26:42.872 --> 26:44.103
(groans)

26:44.103 --> 26:45.304
OKAY, NEEDLE.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.106
(monitor beeping erratically)

26:47.106 --> 26:49.138
(ultrasound whooshing)

26:49.138 --> 26:51.310
HERE.
HERE YOU GO, MER.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.242
(panting)
ALL RIGHT, MARK.
TRY NOT TO MOVE.

26:53.242 --> 26:54.914
(Derek) EASY, MARK. IT'S OKAY.
DON'T MOVE. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.646
AIM FOR HIS LEFT SHOULDER.

26:56.646 --> 26:58.788
WAIT.
DON'T PUNCTURE HIS HEART.
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

26:58.788 --> 26:59.949
CAREFUL.
DON'T PUNCTURE THE HEART.

26:59.949 --> 27:01.090
I KNOW.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.094
OKAY.

27:05.094 --> 27:06.295
(groans)

27:06.295 --> 27:09.628
(monitor beeping erratically)

27:11.330 --> 27:12.762
DEEPER!

27:12.762 --> 27:13.933
AAH!

27:13.933 --> 27:15.264
GOOD. EXCELLENT.

27:15.264 --> 27:16.635
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT. GREAT.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.867
VERY GOOD.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

27:17.867 --> 27:19.038
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S IT.
THAT'S EXACTLY IT.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.309
YOU DID IT.
JUST LET IT DRAIN INTO HERE.

27:20.309 --> 27:21.310
OH, YOU DID IT.
YOU GOT IT.

27:21.310 --> 27:22.672
I GOT IT.
I GOT THE BAG.

27:22.672 --> 27:24.814
YOU GOT IT.
(sighs)

27:24.814 --> 27:25.875
THERE.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.719
WANNA GO FOR LUNCH?

27:29.719 --> 27:32.952
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

27:34.223 --> 27:36.686
HEY! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

27:36.686 --> 27:37.827
(mouth full) EATING.

27:37.827 --> 27:39.328
NO. NO.
YOU HAVE A DINNER TONIGHT.

27:39.328 --> 27:40.990
THE--THE BIGGEST DINNER
OF YOUR LIVES.

27:40.990 --> 27:42.331
(April, mouth full)
HERE'S THE THING,

27:42.331 --> 27:43.863
I CAN'T EAT DUCK.

27:43.863 --> 27:46.696
I HAD A DUCK ON THE FARM.
IT LIVED IN THE HOUSE.

27:46.696 --> 27:48.667
SO ORDER THE STEAK.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.669
HERE'S THE THING,
I HAD A COW--

27:50.669 --> 27:52.341
LOOK, NO ONE REALLY
WANTS TO GO TONIGHT.

27:52.341 --> 27:54.273
HE'S PREORDERING
THE DUCK.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.375
COME ON. WHERE'S--WHERE'S
YOUR SENSE OF OCCASION?

27:56.375 --> 27:58.748
(mouth full)
IN BALTIMORE AT HOPKINS.

27:58.748 --> 28:00.079
(crunches)

28:00.079 --> 28:02.411
WEBBER AND I HAVE ISSUES.
OH, HE KNOWS WHAT HE DID.

28:02.411 --> 28:03.382
(elevator bell dings)

28:03.382 --> 28:05.084
I FAILED MY BOARDS.
I HAVE NOTHING TO CELEBRATE.

28:05.084 --> 28:08.157
(whiney voice) OH, BOO-HOO. OH,
POOR APRIL DIDN'T PASS HER TEST.

28:08.157 --> 28:09.158
(normal voice)
BIG WHOOP, OKAY?

28:09.158 --> 28:10.459
I GOT FIRED
FROM CHIEF RESIDENT,

28:10.459 --> 28:12.461
THEN I GOT FIRED
FROM THIS HOSPITAL.

28:12.461 --> 28:14.463
OH, MY HUSBAND CHEATED
ON ME.

28:14.463 --> 28:16.065
W--YOU WERE MARRIED
TO A MAN?

28:16.065 --> 28:18.097
(crunches)

28:18.097 --> 28:19.268
AND THEN HE DIED.

28:19.268 --> 28:20.429
(ding)

28:20.429 --> 28:22.101
SO I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA
EVER BE HAPPY AGAIN.

28:22.101 --> 28:24.904
BUT NOW MY LIFE
IS PRETTY DAMN GREAT.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.406
SO YOU'RE HAVING A ROUGH TIME.
IT'S NOTHING.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.778
IT'S A BLIP.

28:28.778 --> 28:30.740
AND IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU'RE MISSING YOUR MOMENT.

28:30.740 --> 28:32.742
YOU SURVIVED RESIDENCY.

28:32.742 --> 28:34.383
STOP AND CELEBRATE THAT.

28:34.383 --> 28:36.415
'CAUSE LIFE...
CHANGES IN AN INSTANT.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.416
IT TURNS ON A DIME.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.118
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE MISERABLE,

28:39.118 --> 28:40.820
AND THEN THE NEXT...

28:40.820 --> 28:42.992
YOU'VE MET THE MOST AMAZING
WOMAN IN THE WORLD

28:42.992 --> 28:44.423
AND ARE IN LOVE.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.495
THIS MOMENT,

28:46.495 --> 28:48.427
YOUR MOMENT,

28:48.427 --> 28:50.499
IT ONLY HAPPENS ONCE.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.763
OH, AND THE DUCK

28:53.763 --> 28:56.505
IS FREAKIN' AMAZING.

28:56.505 --> 28:57.837
HEY.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.945
MARK?

29:05.945 --> 29:07.746
WHAT HAPPENED?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.078
TAMPONADE.

29:09.078 --> 29:10.780
MER DID
A PERICARDIOCENTESIS.

29:10.780 --> 29:13.122
OH, MY GOD.
(Meredith)
HE'S HOLDING ON FOR NOW.

29:17.026 --> 29:18.487
WHERE'S LEXIE?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.291
WHERE'S LEXIE?

29:22.291 --> 29:24.193
LEXIE'S DEAD.

29:24.193 --> 29:27.436
SO WE SHOULD GET
A FIRE STARTED.

29:27.436 --> 29:30.069
OH, I'VE GOT--
I'VE GOT THE MATCHES.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.470
WE HAVE FIVE LEFT.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.302
MAKE IT BIG
SO THEY SEE.

29:33.302 --> 29:35.144
(Derek grunts)

29:35.144 --> 29:37.306
(crying) WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE FOUR HOURS, JERRY?

29:37.306 --> 29:38.477
IT'S BEEN MORE

29:38.477 --> 29:39.879
SHH. LISTEN.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.380
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

29:41.380 --> 29:42.812
I MEAN, DOES THAT MEAN THAT
THEY'RE NOT COMING FOR US?

29:42.812 --> 29:44.984
I MEAN, YOU SAID FOUR HOURS.
YOU SAID FOUR HOURSTOPS.

29:44.984 --> 29:47.386
CH-CHOPPER!

29:47.386 --> 29:50.419

29:50.419 --> 29:51.961
OH, MY GOD.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.549
(Arizona) NO, NO, NO!

30:34.263 --> 30:37.266
I CHOSE TULANE.

30:39.108 --> 30:40.839

30:42.141 --> 30:44.213
THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

30:44.213 --> 30:46.145
YEAH.

30:49.248 --> 30:52.121
I FEEL SICK, BY THE WAY.

30:52.121 --> 30:54.853
SICK TO LEAVE HERE,

30:54.853 --> 30:56.225
TO LEAVE YOU.

30:56.225 --> 30:58.557
BUT, UM,

30:58.557 --> 31:01.130
BUT I'M GLAD--I'M GLAD YOU'RE
SO FRIGGIN' HAPPY ABOUT IT.

31:01.130 --> 31:03.392
I'M NOT.

31:03.392 --> 31:06.195
I'M NOT HAPPY
WITH ANY OF IT.

31:06.195 --> 31:08.968
I'M NOT HAPPY THAT
EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I WAS

31:08.968 --> 31:11.300
TURNS OUT NOT TO BE TRUE.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.302
UM, I'M NOT
A BOARD-CERTIFIED SURGEON.

31:13.302 --> 31:16.105
I'M NOT A VIRGIN.
I'M NOT A GOOD CHRISTIAN.

31:16.105 --> 31:18.948
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM,
BUT I KNOW I'M NOT HAPPY.

31:20.649 --> 31:22.912
I LOVED HAVING SEX
WITH YOU.

31:22.912 --> 31:25.514
YOU MADE ME FEEL THINGS...

31:26.956 --> 31:28.487
YOU CHANGED ME, JACKSON.

31:28.487 --> 31:32.091
AND I LOVED THAT.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.093
BUT I HATE
THAT I'M NOT A VIRGIN

31:34.093 --> 31:35.564
(voice breaking)
FOR THE MAN I'M GONNA MARRY.

31:35.564 --> 31:38.197
I'M NOT FREAKIN' HAPPY
ABOUT THAT.

31:38.197 --> 31:41.200
AND I'M REALLY NOT HAPPY
THAT YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT IT,

31:41.200 --> 31:43.402
'CAUSE YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.174
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:45.174 --> 31:46.905
TORRES IS RIGHT.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.437
(chuckles)

31:48.437 --> 31:51.080
MY PROBLEMS WILL STILL BE
MY PROBLEMS TOMORROW

31:51.080 --> 31:53.382
AND THE DAY AFTER THAT
AND THE DAY AFTER THAT.

31:53.382 --> 31:55.084
AND IN A FEW WEEKS,

31:55.084 --> 31:57.086
MY BEST FRIEND
WILL BE AT TULANE,

31:57.086 --> 31:59.388
AND I MAY NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN, SO...

31:59.388 --> 32:02.491
FOR ONE NIGHT, I'M JUST
GONNA FORGET ALL ABOUT THAT.

32:02.491 --> 32:04.693
(normal voice)
AND I'M GONNA TRY.

32:04.693 --> 32:08.427
I'M GONNA TRY TO BE HAPPY.

32:08.427 --> 32:12.201
I'M HAPPY TONIGHT.

32:12.201 --> 32:13.662
I AM GONNA BE HAPPY,
JACKSON,

32:13.662 --> 32:15.334
'CAUSE THIS IS A HAPPY TIME,

32:15.334 --> 32:17.136
AND WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING,
OKAY?

32:17.136 --> 32:19.538
SO CAN YOU PLEASE JUST WIPE THAT
FREAKIN' FROWN OFF YOUR FACE

32:19.538 --> 32:21.270
AND BE HAPPY WITH ME?

32:21.270 --> 32:24.313
(sighs)

32:24.313 --> 32:26.445
YOU LOOK REALLY NICE.

32:28.347 --> 32:31.020
SO DO YOU.

32:45.464 --> 32:50.499
(phone rings)

32:50.499 --> 32:52.301
This is Dr. Robbins.

32:52.301 --> 32:53.442
Leave me your name and number,
and I'll get right back to you.

32:53.442 --> 32:54.603
Thanks.
(beep)

32:54.603 --> 32:56.075
HEY, UM, IT'S ALEX.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.077
LISTEN, UM...

32:58.077 --> 33:00.079
LOOK, THE ONLY REASON
HOPKINS WANTS ME

33:00.079 --> 33:03.082
IS BECAUSE
YOU MADE ME SOMETHING.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.984
ALL RIGHT,YOUMADE ME,
AND I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.986
YOU SAID ONE TIME THAT YOU SAW
SOMETHING IN ME,

33:07.986 --> 33:12.221
AND I MEAN, MOST OF ME
THINKS YOU'RE NUTS, BUT...

33:12.221 --> 33:14.223
I GOTTA GO TO HOPKINS
'CAUSE I GOTTA SEE

33:14.223 --> 33:16.765
IF I'M SOMETHING
WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE,

33:16.765 --> 33:19.298
HOLDING MY HAND, YOU KNOW?

33:19.298 --> 33:22.031
I GUESS I'M SAYING THANKS
OR WHATEVER.

33:22.031 --> 33:23.632
I-I DON'T KNOW.

33:23.632 --> 33:25.334
IF YOU WANT TO BE PISSED
ABOUT IT,

33:25.334 --> 33:27.476
THEN BE PISSED ABOUT IT.

33:27.476 --> 33:29.007

33:30.379 --> 33:33.482
(Jerry) HEY,
THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE.

33:33.482 --> 33:36.285
THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE.

33:36.285 --> 33:37.586
(clears throat)

33:37.586 --> 33:41.050
IT'S BECAUSE THE TRANSMITTER'S
PROBABLY BEEN DAMAGED

33:41.050 --> 33:42.391
IN THE CRASH.

33:42.391 --> 33:43.522
IF THE TRANSMITTER'S
DAMAGED...

33:43.522 --> 33:46.055
WE COULD BE HERE FOR DAYS.

33:46.055 --> 33:48.097
YEAH.

33:53.302 --> 33:56.405
ZOLA.

33:56.405 --> 33:59.368

34:32.401 --> 34:33.602

34:34.843 --> 34:37.306
SHE DIDN'T KNOW.

35:37.806 --> 35:40.439
HEY. YOU WERE LOOKING

WE NEED TO TALK.

35:41.410 --> 35:43.412

35:43.412 --> 35:44.813
WE DON'T.

35:44.813 --> 35:47.216
I AM HAPPY TO STAY.

35:47.216 --> 35:48.377

THINGS ARE SHAKING OUT.

36:02.491 --> 36:04.363
NOW I KNOW YOU HAVE
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES,

36:04.363 --> 36:06.335
SO IF YOU NEED TO MAKE
THOSE PHONE CALLS, THEN--

36:06.335 --> 36:07.696
OWEN, STOP IT. STOP IT.
YOU CAN'T JUST DO THIS.

36:07.696 --> 36:09.238
YOU CAN'T--
