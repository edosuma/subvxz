WEBVTT

00:00.875 --> 00:02.594
They were gonna throw me off the cliff.

00:02.594 --> 00:06.434
Hammers' girlfriend was
shouting... "Kill the fag."

00:06.435 --> 00:07.994
It was a sport back then,

00:07.995 --> 00:10.714
and the Pointers took to
the sport with a vengeance,

00:10.715 --> 00:12.514
led by a Kyle Hampton.

00:12.515 --> 00:15.914
Greg Mills. Dr. Peter Levy. Ned Davies.

00:15.915 --> 00:17.954
Yeah, I knew a couple
of the local coppers.

00:17.955 --> 00:20.754
They weren't interested in Ned.
They reckoned he was asking for it.

00:20.755 --> 00:23.674
- Nick, the numbers are growing.
- 26 years later.

00:23.675 --> 00:27.055
These men were killed just like Haris?

00:27.875 --> 00:29.474
It's a frenzied assault.

00:29.475 --> 00:31.874
Yeah, it's like this one was personal.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.935
The DNA test results you requested?
The blood on the lead pipe?

00:36.100 --> 00:37.834
You're related.

00:37.835 --> 00:39.575
Shane was not gay.

00:40.703 --> 00:44.212
You bash innocent men and
you throw them to their death.

00:44.384 --> 00:46.182
- Is that right?
- Sally...

00:46.207 --> 00:47.554
I don't want anything
to do with the cops.

00:47.555 --> 00:49.194
I don't want anything
to do with Hammers.

00:49.195 --> 00:52.194
There's someone luring people with
that app and then killing them.

00:52.195 --> 00:53.754
You shouldn't be on it yourself.

00:53.755 --> 00:57.274
- Your Thrustr guy. He's online.
- Wh... what?!

00:57.275 --> 00:59.055
Tori, it's not Hammers.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

01:20.615 --> 01:22.375
Oscar!

01:24.315 --> 01:27.415
Pulse is steady. Ambos
should be here soon.

01:29.023 --> 01:30.233
Oscar!

01:30.258 --> 01:31.514
I was having a smoke...

01:31.727 --> 01:33.114
Oscar!

01:33.115 --> 01:35.074
and saw this fella waiting for someone,

01:35.075 --> 01:36.754
then this other fella arrives.

01:36.755 --> 01:38.154
Oscar!

01:38.155 --> 01:41.754
Then I heard a thud and a groan and
I called out, "Everything all right?"

01:41.755 --> 01:43.874
Can you move? Now! Move!

01:43.875 --> 01:46.594
Then I walk around and
see him lying there.

01:47.021 --> 01:48.685
Oscar, can you hear me? Oscar.

01:48.724 --> 01:53.234
I saw a boy killed here. Exact same
spot. Back in the struggle days.

01:53.747 --> 01:58.034
He died in my arms. You
cops didn't give a damn!

01:58.035 --> 02:01.535
- Step back, please.
- Fuckin' bastards.

02:16.290 --> 02:17.775
Could have been him.

02:20.063 --> 02:21.876
Well, we need you to be certain.

02:21.962 --> 02:23.514
It was dark!

02:24.149 --> 02:25.921
What about weapons?

02:26.140 --> 02:29.495
He had something in his fist.
Not a gun or a knife, but, um...

02:30.960 --> 02:32.434
No.

02:33.171 --> 02:34.535
It was him.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.974
He's a thug, sir.

02:41.091 --> 02:43.914
He was a thug when he was
a kid and he's a thug now.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.655
You can't turn a blind eye forever.

02:48.655 --> 02:50.055
I beg your pardon?

02:52.085 --> 02:55.474
I've come across old paperwork
that's left me with some questions.

02:55.475 --> 02:58.900
Old charge sheets. Charges
dropped on your authority.

02:59.634 --> 03:03.194
You called me here in the middle
of the night to tell me that?

03:03.720 --> 03:06.050
Who the bloody hell
do you think you are?

03:06.075 --> 03:08.495
- Is he an informant?
- That's classified.

03:10.548 --> 03:12.074
Hammers is a businessman.

03:12.075 --> 03:14.914
He's got a local bar, and Intel
suggests that he's involved

03:14.915 --> 03:17.815
in the O'Donohues' drug
network, but nothing's proven.

03:19.275 --> 03:21.354
Look, boss, everybody knows

03:21.355 --> 03:23.714
you've got an impeccable
record for drug busts.

03:23.715 --> 03:27.554
Now, maybe Hammers helped you
get those and you can't say.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.295
Well, we all understand that.

03:30.923 --> 03:33.034
But Hammers is in deep shit,

03:33.290 --> 03:36.064
and sometimes you've just got
to cut your informants loose.

03:40.746 --> 03:42.723
- I'll tell you tomorrow.
- We need to go tonight.

03:42.748 --> 03:44.207
What do you hope to find?

03:44.232 --> 03:47.994
A club with Oscar's blood on
it would be pretty useful, sir.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.674
There's no way I'm
gonna ring a magistrate

03:50.675 --> 03:53.229
in the middle of the bloody
night on such flimsy hope.

03:53.612 --> 03:56.424
Hammers, he's a
manipulative piece of work,

03:56.487 --> 04:00.135
but the sick fuck we're after
is something else altogether.

04:29.208 --> 04:30.473
Rhys?

04:34.837 --> 04:36.278
Coming.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.734
Where were you last night?

04:47.669 --> 04:49.007
At work.

05:03.978 --> 05:06.958
I worry about leaving you, Rhys.

05:09.711 --> 05:13.016
You should get yourself a nice girl.

05:20.611 --> 05:21.997
Like you?

05:36.307 --> 05:38.327
No, where are you going?

05:43.554 --> 05:44.854
Thanks.

05:46.574 --> 05:48.002
That the hospital?

05:48.027 --> 05:49.234
Yeah. Brain scan's normal.

05:49.235 --> 05:51.314
- They'll discharge Oscar today.
- Good.

05:51.315 --> 05:53.051
That's a warrant for Hammers.

05:53.176 --> 05:55.434
You control your emotions,
and you, don't get cocky.

05:55.762 --> 05:59.255
Either of you fuck me around, I'll
drop-kick your arses right out of here.

06:13.794 --> 06:16.068
Where was your husband last night?

06:16.161 --> 06:18.543
At the Green Room, then home with me.

06:18.699 --> 06:21.018
- Where is he now?
- No idea.

06:21.043 --> 06:22.538
We lead independent lives.

06:22.796 --> 06:24.715
What time did he get in last night?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.803
Don't know. I was asleep.

06:28.196 --> 06:30.336
Oh, are you a smoker, Cheryl?

06:31.287 --> 06:33.387
Uh, I'm a fitness
trainer. They're Kyle's.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.393
What's this?

06:38.125 --> 06:40.094
A sex toy?

06:40.586 --> 06:42.194
Fancy dress night at the club.

06:42.219 --> 06:44.375
Yeah, I heard the fancy
dress doesn't stay on long.

06:45.115 --> 06:47.175
These are illegal.

06:50.686 --> 06:52.034
Nick?

06:52.912 --> 06:56.714
Do you or your husband have
any fur garments in the house?

06:57.014 --> 06:59.474
I belong to an organisation
that's against cruelty to animals.

06:59.475 --> 07:01.314
Just gonna continue the search.

07:01.315 --> 07:04.674
Please go. When Kyle turns
up, I'll tell him to call you.

07:04.984 --> 07:08.314
Oh, you thought we just wanted to
talk to Kyle? No, no, no, no, no.

07:08.315 --> 07:11.674
Where were you Christmas
Eve 1989? A man was killed.

07:11.675 --> 07:14.364
I know you were there. I have a witness.

07:15.513 --> 07:18.354
You can't rely on the words
of a madwoman. She's insane!

07:18.355 --> 07:20.615
You have no idea who my witness is.

07:22.634 --> 07:24.834
The past is the past. We've
all done things we regret.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.754
And each morning, we are
born again a new person.

07:26.755 --> 07:28.182
- I'm not the person I was yesterday.
- No, no, no.

07:28.206 --> 07:31.474
You don't get to get off the hook by
mouthing some half-baked philosophy.

07:31.475 --> 07:33.735
You really want to pay for Hammers?

07:35.220 --> 07:37.480
You need to talk to me, Cheryl.

07:38.275 --> 07:41.154
I'm racking my brain.
Nothing's coming to me.

07:41.155 --> 07:44.474
Watching a murder and
doing nothing to prevent it

07:44.475 --> 07:46.855
leaves you equally culpable.

07:49.087 --> 07:53.697
A young man was bashed and you were
heard screaming, "Kill the faggot."

07:53.947 --> 07:55.935
What kind of a person does that?

07:57.995 --> 07:59.775
Let me go.

08:01.771 --> 08:04.671
Why does your husband
have a gun beside the bed?

08:06.684 --> 08:08.864
In case he meets you on the beach.

08:16.554 --> 08:18.419
One firearm. That's all you found.

08:18.444 --> 08:20.194
Can you at least tell
me it was unlicensed?

08:20.405 --> 08:23.514
Uh, we're not sure what the weapon
used on Oscar Taylor was yet, boss.

08:23.515 --> 08:25.034
- Any blood?
- Uh, not to the naked eye.

08:25.035 --> 08:27.586
It could have been wiped
clean. But the Thrustr killer,

08:27.611 --> 08:30.274
he definitely met one or more
victims at the Green Room.

08:30.275 --> 08:32.714
Hammers is connected, but
we're just not sure how yet.

08:32.715 --> 08:34.044
Well, pull your fingers out, will you?

08:34.068 --> 08:36.433
The public want the head of
the prick who topped Toohey.

08:36.434 --> 08:39.215
- They don't want false trails.
- Yes, boss.

08:41.894 --> 08:43.246
Hey, Tori.

08:43.955 --> 08:45.434
Have a look at those.

08:45.435 --> 08:48.187
I appropriated them sub-legally.
They weren't on the warrant.

08:48.212 --> 08:51.474
Hmm. O'Donohue brothers.

08:51.595 --> 08:54.034
And the Pointers. Hmm.

08:54.566 --> 08:56.506
Do we know who this is?

08:57.596 --> 08:58.674
Dunno.

08:58.675 --> 09:01.034
Hey. Any wolves at Hammers'?

09:01.361 --> 09:04.763
Oh, I'm tempted to say yes, but no. Why?

09:05.002 --> 09:09.076
The lab just came back with
the results on that fur.

09:09.709 --> 09:10.994
All right.

09:10.995 --> 09:13.535
"Arctic wolf."

09:15.630 --> 09:17.193
Found in Canada.

09:17.654 --> 09:19.634
Beautiful animal. Predator.

09:20.044 --> 09:22.594
- Brenda, you're a legend!
- I know.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.874
"The Arctic wolf hunts
alone or in packs.

09:24.875 --> 09:26.554
"It may look like a loner,

09:26.758 --> 09:29.114
"but the wolf may be out
seeking prey for the pack

09:29.115 --> 09:31.154
"or looking to make its own pack.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.710
"Only the alpha male can mate."

09:46.136 --> 09:48.371
Please don't ask me about the past.

09:48.605 --> 09:52.234
Sally. You can't stay quiet forever.

09:52.691 --> 09:55.413
If you covered up a
crime, you're part of it.

09:55.656 --> 09:57.615
No matter how long ago it was.

09:59.475 --> 10:01.154
How do you want to appear in court,

10:01.155 --> 10:04.634
as a witness or as an
accessory to murder?

10:04.635 --> 10:07.295
'Cause that one can
carry a life sentence.

10:08.690 --> 10:10.612
Just give me something...

10:10.637 --> 10:13.994
so I can say you were
cooperative, all right?

10:15.126 --> 10:17.027
Can you tell me who these people are?

10:19.363 --> 10:22.480
That's, um... Cheryl, me, Hammers,

10:22.605 --> 10:24.293
Brett, Terry,

10:24.496 --> 10:26.874
Adamski, uh, Tomcat...

10:26.875 --> 10:28.954
- Uh, that's Thomas Katz?
- Yeah.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.495
And who's this young boy here?

10:33.582 --> 10:34.994
Um...

10:34.995 --> 10:38.176
It... it wasn't like there
was a regular gang, you know?

10:38.309 --> 10:39.434
Hammers would pick up random kids,

10:39.435 --> 10:41.778
feed them fish and chips,
make them feel special.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.674
The kid was such a weed.
What was his name? Um...

10:46.229 --> 10:47.969
Pee-Sticks.

10:48.388 --> 10:49.770
Pee-Sticks.

10:49.795 --> 10:51.489
Do you remember his proper name?

10:51.784 --> 10:53.169
Mmm...

10:54.807 --> 10:57.794
No, he was just a skinny kid who
did Hammers errands. I don't...

10:58.213 --> 11:00.394
I think he was a relative of Hammers'.

11:01.137 --> 11:04.002
Do you think he would have
witnessed any of the murders?

11:09.806 --> 11:14.175
Sally. These secrets, they
must be driving you crazy.

11:15.887 --> 11:19.387
Imagine what it's doing to
the families of the victims.

11:22.399 --> 11:24.739
Imagine if it was your son.

11:29.062 --> 11:30.260
Mum?

11:31.713 --> 11:32.940
What's going on?

11:33.560 --> 11:34.932
Nothing.

11:35.851 --> 11:39.176
Um... the detective's just
asking me about a missing person.

12:38.964 --> 12:40.523
Mum!

12:40.548 --> 12:42.288
Will!

12:56.635 --> 13:00.234
Jason!

13:02.795 --> 13:06.114
They've come to the
house. They've taken Jason!

13:06.115 --> 13:08.055
They've taken my son!

13:09.978 --> 13:12.114
Whatever you think of
me, my son's innocent.

13:12.115 --> 13:15.114
- You've got to get him back.
- Okay, Sally, I need you to focus.

13:15.115 --> 13:17.154
Focus on what you
heard and what you saw.

13:17.155 --> 13:18.834
Um...

13:19.312 --> 13:23.085
Brett O'Donohue called, said I
made a mistake talking to the cops.

13:23.304 --> 13:26.030
He said Hammers warned him
the cops were digging around.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.531
That, um...

13:27.556 --> 13:31.114
That the Pointers were gonna be set up
for the murder of Toohey and some Arab.

13:31.430 --> 13:33.434
- Payback.
- Payback? Payback for what?

13:33.435 --> 13:35.794
For... for an act in the past?

13:36.422 --> 13:38.906
I said it didn't matter what I
told you you already knew the truth.

13:38.930 --> 13:40.714
He called me a fuckin'
bitch and hung up.

13:40.715 --> 13:43.155
He's a good boy.

13:43.397 --> 13:45.154
I don't want them getting to him.

13:45.577 --> 13:48.954
Sally, they are afraid. They're
afraid you can put them in prison.

13:48.955 --> 13:51.394
And that is one way we can
deal with them, all right?

13:51.902 --> 13:54.762
Get my son back. Please.

13:55.549 --> 13:56.754
Can you do that?

14:04.875 --> 14:08.095
Gonna go have a piss.

14:10.351 --> 14:11.835
Get us a coffee!

14:12.031 --> 14:14.194
- Oh, fuck off.
- Two sugars!

14:15.069 --> 14:16.495
Get it yourself.

14:19.471 --> 14:21.714
Brett! Cops!

14:22.104 --> 14:25.335
Hands on your head!

14:27.003 --> 14:29.679
- Brett!
- Drop the weapon, Terry!

14:31.675 --> 14:33.855
Drop the gun now, Terry.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.668
Uh, search the rest of the place.

14:45.306 --> 14:46.933
Oh, fuck...

14:49.709 --> 14:51.393
Where's the kid?

14:52.870 --> 14:54.354
Where is Jason?!

14:54.355 --> 14:56.879
- Dunno what you're talking about.
- Where is he?!

14:57.176 --> 14:59.515
We're not saying nothing
till we get our lawyer.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.600
All right, Brett? Nothing!

15:04.921 --> 15:06.074
There's enough drugs here

15:06.075 --> 15:08.074
to keep them out of Bondi
till they're pensioners.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.955
Here. Get a shot of them
against the police car.

15:11.054 --> 15:12.384
- Get the lights?
- Yep.

15:12.409 --> 15:13.560
Righto.

15:19.743 --> 15:21.943
Terry's full of himself, so
I'll take him back to the office

15:21.967 --> 15:24.662
and just let him stew a
bit. You and Lustigman...

15:25.133 --> 15:26.647
you try and open up Brett a bit, hey?

15:28.835 --> 15:31.474
I think our guest, well, he
deserves the scenic route.

15:31.475 --> 15:33.474
Let him enjoy the outside view.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.718
'Cause it's gonna be his last.

16:34.108 --> 16:36.008
This never happened. Okay?

16:39.427 --> 16:41.367
Let's go get the kid.

16:54.392 --> 16:57.524
Sally, we've got Hammers for abduction,
assault, deprivation of liberty,

16:57.549 --> 16:59.754
and when we get the DNA results, murder.

16:59.755 --> 17:01.914
He's going away for a very long time.

17:01.915 --> 17:05.375
He won't hurt you or Jason ever again.

17:06.613 --> 17:08.355
Now will you talk?

17:14.136 --> 17:16.530
Did you kill Haris Rexhaj?

17:17.040 --> 17:18.394
No.

17:19.096 --> 17:20.788
Did you kill Christopher Toohey?

17:22.823 --> 17:25.803
No way. Toohey was a mate.

17:29.031 --> 17:30.971
Did you kill Greg Mills?

17:33.516 --> 17:35.456
I did my time for that.

17:39.385 --> 17:42.154
Well, your lawyer,
she's on her way, um...

17:42.498 --> 17:44.174
but in the meantime, it would be useful

17:44.199 --> 17:48.043
if we could go over the
Greg Mills murder in 1990.

17:50.909 --> 17:53.874
We were just kids out for a good time.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.594
This night was different.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.722
There was this, um...

17:59.675 --> 18:03.034
electricity in the air, like
there was gonna be a storm.

18:03.568 --> 18:05.834
The boys were preparing...

18:06.429 --> 18:07.951
like, for a hunt.

18:09.037 --> 18:11.474
Saturday night. You know,
what are you gonna do?

18:11.475 --> 18:13.914
We go down the park and bash fags.

18:14.542 --> 18:16.956
We get money out of it, well,
we have a piss-up or something.

18:17.316 --> 18:19.274
I'm not proud of it, but we
weren't the only ones doing it.

18:19.275 --> 18:21.175
It was up and down the coast.

18:22.970 --> 18:24.400
Fag-bashing.

18:25.352 --> 18:27.267
I'm just telling you like it is.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.682
They'd done it before.

18:30.762 --> 18:32.071
You could tell.

18:33.035 --> 18:34.954
It was all mapped out.

18:35.650 --> 18:37.078
Every move.

18:40.362 --> 18:41.691
Hey, faggot!

18:41.717 --> 18:43.236
Oh!

18:43.292 --> 18:45.714
He jumped up, lost
his glasses stumbling.

18:46.339 --> 18:49.756
Hammer... Adamski started hitting him.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.085
Faggot!

18:51.110 --> 18:53.770
Kill the faggot! Kill the faggot!

19:01.260 --> 19:03.520
Greg Mills didn't wear glasses.

19:04.835 --> 19:07.235
That was a man called Ned Davies.

19:12.101 --> 19:13.664
Turn the tape off.

19:14.969 --> 19:17.047
I'm not saying nothing
till my lawyer gets here.

19:26.606 --> 19:28.514
He was bleeding pretty bad.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.606
Hammers was freaking out.

19:31.788 --> 19:33.684
"We've got to chuck him over."

19:34.915 --> 19:36.554
I called out.

19:36.898 --> 19:39.558
"Don't. Please don't."

19:41.485 --> 19:42.862
And, um...

19:44.479 --> 19:47.015
they swung him over the cliff...

19:48.422 --> 19:50.162
and let go...

19:51.863 --> 19:53.724
and there was a thud.

19:57.136 --> 20:00.174
Sally, you're doing really well.

20:06.104 --> 20:08.975
The waves were crashing over the rocks.

20:10.812 --> 20:12.712
Uh, I thought...

20:14.881 --> 20:16.389
I hoped...

20:17.107 --> 20:18.735
maybe it was a dream.

20:20.850 --> 20:22.487
A bad dream.

20:35.945 --> 20:37.965
- Sally?
- Mmm?

20:39.122 --> 20:40.714
Do you recognise...

20:41.331 --> 20:43.176
any of these men?

20:50.164 --> 20:51.474
It was one of them.

20:51.969 --> 20:53.594
"Him", Sally.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.984
The victim was a person.

21:01.008 --> 21:02.828
I'm sorry.

21:12.994 --> 21:14.533
It was him.

21:20.119 --> 21:21.971
He wasn't the first.

21:30.223 --> 21:32.699
I recognise... him.

21:35.417 --> 21:37.437
His beautiful black hair.

21:45.123 --> 21:46.735
Sorry.

21:51.868 --> 21:54.154
Prisoner! Listen.

21:54.454 --> 21:57.914
Jason is the son of an old mate
of mine. I was taking him fishing.

21:58.371 --> 22:00.049
Did you have his mother's permission?

22:00.074 --> 22:02.314
The kid's old enough to go fishing
without a note from his mummy.

22:02.315 --> 22:05.394
He was dragged out of bed
by the O'Donohues at 2am.

22:05.395 --> 22:07.465
Ah, you see, that's
when the fish are biting.

22:09.652 --> 22:11.634
Do you recognise these leather bindings?

22:11.635 --> 22:13.575
No, I've never seen that before.

22:15.207 --> 22:16.816
What about this?

22:17.439 --> 22:19.179
Fuck. What is that?

22:19.939 --> 22:21.194
Not mine.

22:21.195 --> 22:25.074
Huh. Maybe it belongs to
your cousin, Pee-Sticks.

22:25.075 --> 22:26.554
"Pee-Sticks"!

22:26.555 --> 22:28.354
I haven't got a cousin.

22:28.659 --> 22:30.439
Do you recognise this boy?

22:32.310 --> 22:33.834
No.

22:34.247 --> 22:37.994
He could have been hanging round like
a bad smell back in the day, but no...

22:38.419 --> 22:42.573
When you say "hanging around",
he was part of your gang?

22:42.972 --> 22:45.800
- The gang that hunted gay men?
- "Hunted"?

22:46.807 --> 22:48.690
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!
"Hunted"?

22:48.715 --> 22:52.394
Jesus Christ. Sally tell you
that, did she? Hmm? Head case?

22:52.786 --> 22:55.930
It'll be her word against
mine, and she's a nobody.

22:55.955 --> 22:59.714
So was that fuck-knuckle, who I do
not know, and where did you get that?

22:59.715 --> 23:01.535
DNA's a match.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.672
Do you recognise these men?

23:17.720 --> 23:19.165
No.

23:19.602 --> 23:21.754
This is Dr. Peter Levy.

23:21.755 --> 23:24.394
October 1989, his body was found

23:24.395 --> 23:26.674
at the base of the
cliffs at Cardinal Park.

23:26.675 --> 23:28.274
Did you push him off the ledge?

23:28.509 --> 23:30.249
No.

23:31.418 --> 23:33.066
This is Ned Davies.

23:33.175 --> 23:36.874
December 1989, he went for
a walk and he didn't return,

23:37.044 --> 23:40.274
and I've been hearing stories that
he met with his death at your hands.

23:42.215 --> 23:43.674
No!

23:46.513 --> 23:50.594
Another young man was
killed December 1989.

23:50.904 --> 23:52.434
It was Christmas Eve.

23:52.810 --> 23:55.234
The same night that
Detectives Chalmers and Peel

23:55.235 --> 23:57.455
pulled an improvised weapon off you.

23:58.630 --> 24:01.514
That weapon... had his blood on it.

24:02.450 --> 24:03.674
And that weapon...

24:04.237 --> 24:05.995
has your DNA on it.

24:11.955 --> 24:16.234
Your arrogance might almost be
impressive if it didn't make me sick.

24:16.831 --> 24:20.354
And you thought you'd get away with
all those years of violence and murder

24:20.620 --> 24:22.062
and it wouldn't matter.

24:23.184 --> 24:25.564
That no one would come for you.

24:31.843 --> 24:33.583
Your brother...

24:34.455 --> 24:36.395
got what was coming to him.

24:41.383 --> 24:43.843
Tori, outside! Now!

24:54.745 --> 24:57.674
You picked up Hammers. You
had evidence. You did nothing!

24:57.675 --> 24:59.455
We had nothing!

25:00.495 --> 25:02.194
There was no body.
There was no complaint.

25:02.706 --> 25:04.114
Jesus, come on. It was Christmas Eve.

25:04.115 --> 25:06.074
I thought the boys got
in a bit of a scrap.

25:06.516 --> 25:07.834
"Bit of a scrap"?

25:08.608 --> 25:10.446
My father trusted you!

25:13.379 --> 25:16.079
Did you even read
Shane's autopsy report?

25:19.749 --> 25:21.117
You did!

25:22.312 --> 25:24.010
You thought it was a suicide!

25:24.998 --> 25:26.201
Oh, fuck!

25:26.711 --> 25:28.342
You can't go back in there.

25:29.275 --> 25:31.562
I can't have you dealing with him

25:31.587 --> 25:34.434
or the O'Donohues or
Oscar Taylor's assault.

25:34.827 --> 25:37.114
You go back in there, your
participation jeopardises

25:37.115 --> 25:40.095
any charges we want to
make against Hammers.

25:41.252 --> 25:42.580
Murder.

25:43.830 --> 25:47.575
Davies, Levy and Shane.

26:22.637 --> 26:24.012
We got him, Dad.

26:25.510 --> 26:27.610
We got the guy that killed Shane.

26:31.564 --> 26:33.304
He didn't drown.

26:35.047 --> 26:37.554
He was murdered because he was gay.

26:38.008 --> 26:40.628
He was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

27:45.677 --> 27:47.154
Are you okay?

27:47.374 --> 27:49.194
One hell of a headache.

27:50.911 --> 27:52.669
So, what you were doing out there?

27:52.702 --> 27:55.799
Hunting the Thrustr killer
all by yourself, huh?

27:59.406 --> 28:01.074
We got Hammers.

28:01.075 --> 28:03.714
That's a result for Shane,
it's a result for the others.

28:03.715 --> 28:05.514
That's just it.

28:05.515 --> 28:07.234
We're still dying, Tori.

28:07.235 --> 28:09.714
And that piece of shit is responsible.

28:10.410 --> 28:14.035
You need to promise me you're
not gonna do anything stupid.

28:14.222 --> 28:16.824
You have to leave this to us.

28:29.532 --> 28:31.194
I thought you were off the case.

28:31.195 --> 28:33.074
I can't stop thinking about Pee-Sticks.

28:33.298 --> 28:36.114
Sally said he was related to
Hammers. Hammers denies it.

28:36.115 --> 28:40.579
I'm wondering if somehow he could
be a relative of the O'Donohues.

28:50.446 --> 28:53.944
The only O'Donohues coming
up are, um, Terry and Brett.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.466
And their father, Bert.

28:56.491 --> 29:00.674
He died inside Long Bay after
the stabbing of a brothel owner.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.834
What about on the mother's side?

29:03.611 --> 29:06.274
Uh, mother's maiden name was Birnie.

29:06.275 --> 29:09.434
She was sentenced for
handling stolen goods.

29:09.830 --> 29:11.594
I have seen that name before.

29:11.845 --> 29:13.170
In here.

29:13.195 --> 29:16.255
Chalmers' case files. Are you game?

29:54.342 --> 29:55.646
Tori.

29:58.982 --> 30:00.954
Rhys Callahan.

30:01.255 --> 30:04.794
Committed murder, 16, Newcastle.

30:05.107 --> 30:08.247
Mother, Belinda Birnie,
Deborah's sister.

30:09.515 --> 30:11.754
The victim was a social
worker in Newcastle

30:11.755 --> 30:13.714
who was known for working
with troubled youths.

30:13.715 --> 30:16.794
He was discovered by a neighbour
in a blood-splattered room.

30:16.795 --> 30:19.794
His head had been caved in
before being stabbed to death.

30:20.091 --> 30:23.831
Graduated from the School of Hammers.

30:29.605 --> 30:31.914
Hello. He was released on
parole three months ago.

30:43.623 --> 30:45.646
Guess he gave away the surfer look.

30:46.552 --> 30:48.332
We have Pee-Sticks.

31:16.247 --> 31:18.914
Rhys was assigned to me as a juvenile.

31:19.231 --> 31:22.834
His mother was a prostitute

31:22.859 --> 31:24.761
and his father abusive.

31:24.786 --> 31:27.354
He punished Rhys for
being a 'sissy boy'.

31:27.355 --> 31:31.754
And in fact was charged for
sexual misconduct with a minor,

31:31.755 --> 31:33.634
but the case never made it to court,

31:33.635 --> 31:36.314
and Rhys insists his
father never touched him.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.740
Did you believe him?

31:39.235 --> 31:42.455
He had all the hallmarks
of a severely abused boy.

31:45.859 --> 31:50.695
Rhys can be very charming.
Charismatic, plausible.

31:51.515 --> 31:55.794
He lives calmly in a controlled
environment, like the prison,

31:55.795 --> 31:59.888
but he's manipulative, psychopathic.

32:01.537 --> 32:04.045
He was 16 when he committed the murder.

32:04.070 --> 32:06.302
- Did he offer up any excuse?

32:06.990 --> 32:10.135
The man hit on him and he panicked.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.092
This signature...

32:19.303 --> 32:22.950
it doesn't fit with
impulsive lashing out.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.154
He'd taken his time.

32:25.241 --> 32:27.661
I think he'd fantasised about it.

32:29.192 --> 32:33.034
When Rhys was 11 years old, he hung
around with a youth named Hammers,

32:33.059 --> 32:35.069
who held sway over a group of boys

32:35.094 --> 32:38.090
who hunted and bashed gay men.

32:38.419 --> 32:40.879
He'd certainly witnessed murder.

32:52.981 --> 32:56.154
Are we talking about a Kyle Hampton?

32:56.973 --> 32:58.401
Rhys hated him.

32:58.426 --> 33:01.230
In fact, a day before the murder,

33:01.255 --> 33:03.874
he had gone to visit Kyle Hampton

33:03.875 --> 33:06.083
and been told to piss off.

33:06.108 --> 33:09.274
So he went out to prove himself worthy.

33:09.275 --> 33:11.895
That's why he meets his
victims at the Green Room.

33:25.880 --> 33:30.779
Rhys's dad fell off a cliff just
five days after Rhys was released.

33:31.075 --> 33:33.034
"Death by misadventure."

33:33.035 --> 33:35.015
Yeah, sounds more like revenge.

33:36.155 --> 33:38.194
Any address on the parole card?

33:38.195 --> 33:41.954
Uh, his dad's address was in Gateshead.

33:42.509 --> 33:44.075
What about the mother?

33:49.613 --> 33:53.575
There's a Birnie in Ramsgate Ave, Bondi.

34:09.472 --> 34:11.371
Hello? Is anyone home?

34:13.962 --> 34:15.688
Rhys?

34:21.844 --> 34:23.489
Police.

34:23.879 --> 34:25.871
No need to be afraid.

34:26.335 --> 34:28.934
Just want to speak to your son, Rhys.

34:41.835 --> 34:46.634
Has Rhys seemed... distressed,
disturbed at the moment?

34:46.635 --> 34:48.754
Rhys would never have done what he did

34:48.755 --> 34:50.634
if the old man hadn't pushed him!

34:52.114 --> 34:55.194
And what has Rhys done? Where
is he? Where can we find him?

34:55.429 --> 34:56.914
Where is he?

34:57.079 --> 34:59.899
You want Rhys, you find him yourself.

35:04.209 --> 35:06.469
Run, Rhys! Run!

35:08.157 --> 35:09.674
Stop! Police!

35:31.925 --> 35:33.793
Police! Stop!

35:37.961 --> 35:39.741
Freeze, you little prick!

35:54.996 --> 35:56.634
Do you know Christopher Toohey?

35:56.902 --> 35:58.450
Never met the guy.

35:58.871 --> 36:01.034
See, Rhys, the problem
is, when you, uh...

36:01.378 --> 36:03.474
when you tell a small
lie, it becomes a big lie,

36:03.475 --> 36:05.975
and then all of a sudden,
you're in a big pile of shit.

36:08.089 --> 36:09.631
Now, see, I thought you and Toohey

36:09.656 --> 36:13.335
were both members of the Bondi
Pointers gang back in '89.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.530
You remember that far back?

36:18.034 --> 36:21.970
Can you identify... this
person and... that one?

36:22.425 --> 36:24.129
Well, that was me.

36:24.699 --> 36:27.074
We just went to Bondi on holidays.

36:27.504 --> 36:29.415
In '89, I was 11.

36:30.315 --> 36:32.194
That one was Toohey.

36:32.749 --> 36:35.209
You can see he's quite
a bit older than me.

36:36.102 --> 36:38.234
Well, Toohey's been murdered.

36:38.688 --> 36:40.735
And since you knew Toohey...

36:41.959 --> 36:43.899
I thought you might know why.

36:46.144 --> 36:47.996
Well, Toohey wasn't...

36:48.482 --> 36:50.746
who he pretended to be, so...

36:52.282 --> 36:53.718
And what was that?

36:53.750 --> 36:56.133
Strong. Someone you can look up to.

36:56.187 --> 36:57.766
A real man.

37:01.263 --> 37:04.314
- Did you kill Christopher Toohey?
- No.

37:04.315 --> 37:07.123
- Did you kill Haris Rexhaj?
- No.

37:07.638 --> 37:11.295
- Adrian Cohen?
- Who? No.

37:12.821 --> 37:14.914
But you did kill a man
in Newcastle, right?

37:15.805 --> 37:19.634
Well, he was a... piece of
filth who got what was coming.

37:20.125 --> 37:22.394
How about your father? How did he die?

37:23.597 --> 37:25.092
He fell off a cliff.

37:26.451 --> 37:27.754
Did he have it coming?

37:28.790 --> 37:30.670
Some might say so.

37:31.275 --> 37:34.154
Well, we've been talking
to your cousins, um,

37:34.155 --> 37:36.554
and I guess you know
that Brett was convicted

37:36.555 --> 37:39.954
of murdering a gay man in
Cardinal Park back in 1990.

37:41.282 --> 37:44.474
Well, the names of the men that I've
asked you about, they were gay men.

37:45.195 --> 37:46.834
And they were murdered.

37:47.389 --> 37:48.922
What's this got to do with me?

37:49.828 --> 37:54.074
Well, there were other
murders back in '89, 1990,

37:54.702 --> 37:57.585
and we have reason to believe
that you were a witness to them.

38:00.310 --> 38:02.634
Now, look, Rhys, we know you were a kid.

38:03.275 --> 38:05.076
You were easily led.

38:06.272 --> 38:09.114
See, the problem is, you've got
this conviction in Newcastle,

38:09.115 --> 38:11.233
so it's very easy to say...

38:11.993 --> 38:14.895
"It's all his fault," you
know, point the finger at you.

38:17.749 --> 38:19.607
It was such a long time ago.

38:21.357 --> 38:23.279
Nobody cared back then.

38:23.778 --> 38:25.228
Why now?

38:27.076 --> 38:29.509
Have you got Thrustr
on your phone, Rhys?

38:30.897 --> 38:33.117
Why would I use an app for fags?

38:35.318 --> 38:38.656
Where were you at
midnight on January 25?

38:40.092 --> 38:41.832
Um...

38:44.835 --> 38:48.615
Let me see. I was looking after my mum.

38:49.607 --> 38:51.347
I do that most nights.

39:12.201 --> 39:14.634
DNA profiling on the suspect's
gonna take at least a week.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.394
Oh, shit.

39:16.912 --> 39:18.874
His computer's pretty sick.

39:19.100 --> 39:22.474
Full of Neo-Nazi stuff. Violent porn.

39:22.878 --> 39:24.674
He's tracking the investigation,

39:24.675 --> 39:28.550
but there's nothing to actually
link him to the killings.

39:30.419 --> 39:32.292
We're gonna have to let this prick go.

40:03.931 --> 40:06.471
- That's no suicide.
- Uh-uh.

40:57.357 --> 40:58.761
There's nothing on his
hard drive to indicate

40:58.785 --> 41:00.834
he's got any other
properties, residences.

41:00.947 --> 41:02.714
Bills? Banking?

41:02.987 --> 41:04.274
Nothing.

41:04.470 --> 41:06.450
"Real estate lease." There.

41:08.323 --> 41:10.714
Righto, uniforms are all over
this. All points has gone out.

41:10.715 --> 41:13.935
There's over 200 cops with that
prick's photo patrolling Mardi Gras.

41:16.440 --> 41:17.729
Tori.

41:20.435 --> 41:22.335
Oh, my God.

41:33.526 --> 41:35.975
Get your arses down there.

42:51.668 --> 42:53.568
My place is this way.

42:58.581 --> 42:59.796
Whatcha doing?

42:59.821 --> 43:02.241
Texting I got lucky.

43:07.995 --> 43:09.815
Shit!

43:13.932 --> 43:15.752
I need an urgent trace.

43:17.672 --> 43:20.354
You hear about that nut job
running around killing guys?

43:21.300 --> 43:22.335
No.

43:23.929 --> 43:25.593
It's not in the papers.

43:25.916 --> 43:27.155
Gay press.

43:36.434 --> 43:39.010
Try the mobile tower in Surry Hills.

43:39.550 --> 43:41.412
Surry Hills!

43:46.889 --> 43:48.714
Okay, they've got it.

43:48.715 --> 43:50.455
Travelling down Nobbs.

43:51.595 --> 43:53.775
Just took a left into Bourke.

43:59.195 --> 44:00.834
So, where is your place?

44:00.835 --> 44:02.575
Oh, it's not far.

45:12.382 --> 45:13.861
The signal's here.

45:30.028 --> 45:33.375
The pain goes away.

45:41.082 --> 45:42.397
Did you hear that?

45:43.364 --> 45:45.224
The phone's down the drain.

45:49.506 --> 45:54.135
Nick. Do we know what brothel
Belinda Birnie used to work at?

45:59.256 --> 46:00.913
Arggh!

46:12.797 --> 46:14.437
You're marked now.

46:15.768 --> 46:17.748
Everyone will know what you are.

46:46.096 --> 46:47.836
Arggh!

46:56.201 --> 46:58.501
Oscar, I'm here.

47:00.635 --> 47:01.916
Shoot the prick!

47:02.288 --> 47:04.068
Let him go!

47:05.276 --> 47:07.674
Let him go or I will shoot!

47:08.455 --> 47:10.651
You know, I know who you are.

47:10.903 --> 47:13.205
And your brother Shane.

47:14.814 --> 47:16.475
He was my first.

47:30.331 --> 47:32.027
Nick, talk to me.

47:32.464 --> 47:35.113
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, whatever.

48:03.256 --> 48:04.874
Hey.

48:06.288 --> 48:08.468
Well, well done. Well done, you.

48:09.698 --> 48:11.163
You and Nick. Good work.

48:14.706 --> 48:17.035
- I... I think I know how you feel.
- You don't know how I feel.

48:17.059 --> 48:19.834
You don't know how any of the
families of the victims feel.

48:20.096 --> 48:22.189
Well, I know I'm a father myself.

48:23.985 --> 48:27.540
Do you know how many files
I have on my desk right now?

48:28.360 --> 48:31.754
Unexplained gay deaths and assaults

48:31.755 --> 48:33.634
in Sydney over those years?

48:34.593 --> 48:35.714
How does that happen?

48:35.715 --> 48:38.788
Tori. Tori.

48:40.075 --> 48:41.702
Sometimes...

48:42.264 --> 48:44.034
things, they just fall
through the cracks.

48:44.035 --> 48:46.194
Oh, "fall through the
cracks"? Right, right.

48:46.195 --> 48:50.754
Or there was indifference
on a grand scale.

48:50.755 --> 48:52.394
Hammers was your informant.

48:52.395 --> 48:54.354
You look the other way,
you keep your stats up,

48:54.355 --> 48:56.314
he gets rid of all his enemies.

48:56.315 --> 48:57.874
If I had known he'd hurt your brother...

48:57.875 --> 48:59.834
My brother? Anybody. Anybody!

49:00.623 --> 49:02.896
Hammers got away with
murdering my brother.

49:03.482 --> 49:05.594
And other men. Good men.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.194
Listen.

49:07.409 --> 49:08.794
There were two kids in trouble

49:08.795 --> 49:10.980
and they had a chance of a good
future if I stepped in and helped.

49:11.004 --> 49:12.620
I chose to do that.

49:12.875 --> 49:15.895
One turned out to be a hero,
the other didn't. I mean...

49:16.954 --> 49:18.194
what would you have done?

49:18.515 --> 49:21.649
My job. I would have done my job.

51:32.804 --> 51:34.171
Shane...

51:34.700 --> 51:37.720
it's for the 19 precious
years we had you.

51:39.371 --> 51:41.231
Who you were.

51:42.857 --> 51:44.597
Who you would have become.

51:48.797 --> 51:50.419
Son, I'm proud of you.
