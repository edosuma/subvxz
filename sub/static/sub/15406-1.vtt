01:34.636 --> 01:36.497
- Here he comes, now.
- Hello, Paul.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.917
- Let me get a picture, Mr. Madvig.
- Yeah, all right.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.001
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.461
- Swell.
- Hello, Paul. How're you?

01:42.519 --> 01:44.755
- Fine. How're you?
- Who is that guy?

01:44.855 --> 01:45.714
Paul Madvig.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.934
- He's head of the Voters League.
- Hello, Mr. Madvig.

01:48.025 --> 01:51.428
- Glad to see you. Hello, son.
- He's the biggest crook in the state.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.639
I hear he feeds a thousand people a week.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.807
Is it true you've throwing over
Governor Hartman?

01:55.907 --> 01:58.060
What about Ralph Henry
and his Reform Party?

01:58.160 --> 02:00.145
If Ralph Henry's so anxious
to reform somebody...

02:00.245 --> 02:01.647
why don't he start on that son of his?

02:01.747 --> 02:04.842
He's gets in more jams
than the dead end kids.

02:07.878 --> 02:11.615
That's for talking about decent people.
A little reform wouldn't do you any harm.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.785
As a matter of fact, I think it would do
the state good if somebody'd reform you...

02:14.885 --> 02:19.311
right out of existence.
Get out of my way, you cheap crook.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.609
Hey, what a slugger.

02:24.436 --> 02:27.485
- Who is that?
- Ralph Henry's daughter.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.816
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.054
- Hey, Ed.
- Hiya, Paul.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.722
I just met the swellest dame.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.225
- Yeah?
- Yeah. She smacked me in the kisser.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.893
- All right.
- Hey, Sloss, come here.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.033
- I don't get it.
- Look...

02:41.078 --> 02:42.187
- What do you want?
- Oh, never mind.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.568
Go out and tell old man Henry
I want to see him, will you?

02:44.665 --> 02:47.276
- That's a good one.
- What is?

02:47.376 --> 02:49.570
- Are you serious?
- Why not?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.446
What'll Nick Varna
and the rest of the boys say...

02:51.546 --> 02:53.323
if they hear you've been talking
to a Reform candidate?

02:53.423 --> 02:54.783
Oh, what do I care what they say.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.618
- You'd better care!
- Oh, yeah?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.745
Yeah, if you want to keep on being boss.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.415
You better wash your mouth out,
young fellow. Come here.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.313
Lay off there, will you!

03:20.534 --> 03:24.914
- Tell Madvig I want to see him right away.
- Yes, Mr. Varna.

03:30.377 --> 03:35.634
- Four is your point, Ed. Come on, Ed.
- Ed, Nick Varna wants to see Paul.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.931
Little Joe, brother, that's it.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.196
I'll tell him you're here.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.184
Yeah, take care of yourself, Gus. Right.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.706
Hi, Ed.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.587
Nick Varna's downstairs.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.720
- Yeah?
- He wants to see you right away, Paul.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.531
- Tell him I'm busy.
- But, Paul...

04:16.630 --> 04:19.826
Tell him if he wants to wait around,
maybe I can find some time for him later.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.394
Maybe.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.681
Tell him.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.028
- Paul.
- Yeah?

04:30.979 --> 04:34.257
You're really going through
with that crazy idea?

04:34.357 --> 04:37.552
- What crazy idea?
- Backing old man Henry on the Reform ticket.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.450
- That's right.
- That's wrong.

04:40.489 --> 04:44.393
- "That's wrong"?
- Yeah. As wrong as those socks.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.937
Wait a minute, what's wrong with them?

04:47.037 --> 04:48.313
- The clock.
- Yeah.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.649
Mmm-hmm, it ticks too loud.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.628
You know I thought they was pretty.

04:54.252 --> 04:58.073
Yeah, old man Henry and me
is cooking up the deal tonight at dinner.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.658
At his house.

04:59.758 --> 05:03.161
And say, Ed, it's his daughter's birthday,
what do you think I ought to give her?

05:03.261 --> 05:05.247
- Want to make a good impression?
- Sure.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.165
- Nothing.
- But why?

05:07.265 --> 05:08.709
Because you're not supposed to
give people things...

05:08.809 --> 05:11.437
unless you're sure
they like to get them from you.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.255
Well, maybe.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.549
But I'm not gonna pass up
an opportunity like this.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.008
- You see, I like...
- All right.

05:17.108 --> 05:20.512
Give her a convertible
or a handful of diamonds.

05:20.612 --> 05:24.391
Well, maybe you know more
about it than I do, I guess.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.040
Think he'll play ball after election?

05:27.536 --> 05:28.958
I know he will.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.524
Why, he's practically given me the key
to his house.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.843
Yeah, a glass key.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.822
- Be careful it doesn't break off in your hand.
- Don't worry.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.640
It won't.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.929
How far has that dog
got her hooks into you?

05:48.473 --> 05:49.816
Ed.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.361
I'm gonna marry Janet Henry.

05:54.396 --> 05:57.549
Course nobody knows about it yet,
except you and me.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.802
Well, you'd better insist on the wedding
before election day.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.638
Then you can be sure
of your pound of flesh.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.833
But, Mr. Varna,
he left positive orders to...

06:07.784 --> 06:09.661
Shut up, Oswald.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.274
Come on in.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.897
Have a chair.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.323
- Cigar?
- Thanks.

06:42.861 --> 06:46.181
You know, Paul,
they closed my places last night.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.391
Broke a lot of equipment.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.852
Yeah. We read about it in the paper.

06:50.952 --> 06:54.456
Rainey said the order came
straight from you.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.151
Well, what do you think of that, Ed?

06:58.251 --> 07:01.363
I think somebody ought to give Rainey
a nice long vacation.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.199
Business is business
and politics is politics.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.535
But they ought to be kept apart.

07:06.635 --> 07:10.981
- I bought protection, Paul, and I want it.
- Well, I tell you, Nick.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.818
We're gonna clean up this town.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.297
I'm too big to take the boot from you now.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.884
You maybe too big to take it laying down,
Nick, but you're gonna take it.

07:22.984 --> 07:26.158
- You are taking it.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.582
The Golden Club's open tonight.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.584
Get me Rainey.

07:37.248 --> 07:41.194
Hello, Rainey, it's Paul.
How're the folks? Good.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.530
Hey, look, Rainey...

07:43.630 --> 07:48.101
just got the tip that Nick is opening
his Golden Club tonight.

07:49.344 --> 07:52.894
Yeah, slam him down so hard,
they'll splash!

07:56.393 --> 07:59.522
- Well, Nick, now you know where you stand.
- Thanks.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.067
I tell you, you haven't got
a thing to worry about.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.611
We mustn't forget the opposition.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.946
What, that guy here reminds me
of is an electric fence.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.741
Buzzing around all day,
nothing comes out but wind.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.826
You know politics is simple.

08:29.926 --> 08:34.164
All you need is a little muscle.
Look, muscle gave me my start in politics.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.167
It was when I was assistant
to old man Zimmerman, the plumber.

08:37.267 --> 08:41.379
- Mr. Madvig, you're joking.
- You mean about the plumbing or the muscle?

08:41.479 --> 08:43.519
- Well, I just can't imagine you as a plumber.
- No?

08:43.523 --> 08:47.198
I'll drop up to your bathroom some day
and show you.

08:52.907 --> 08:56.227
Well, Paul, I must say,
you've come a long way since then.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.062
Yeah.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.689
Coffee will be served in the living room,
Mr. Madvig.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.166
Okay.

09:05.545 --> 09:09.115
He's funny, but don't you think he'll
get a bit tiresome as a steady boarder?

09:09.215 --> 09:12.077
Paul's support means
the Governorship for me.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.622
- I know, but is being Governor worth it?
- Don't joke.

09:15.722 --> 09:19.376
And you must be nice to him, Janet,
anyway until after the election.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.776
All right, Dad,
at least he'll be some laughs.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.179
- Janet...
- Why weren't you at dinner?

09:31.279 --> 09:34.432
With Madvig, I'd sooner cut my throat.
Look, I've got to have some money.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.393
But I've already given you
every penny I have.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.104
- Well, then ask Dad for a loan.
- I can't.

09:39.204 --> 09:43.149
- Oh, Taylor, why don't you stop gambling?
- Don't go sanctimonious on me.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.027
I'm not.
But if you'd only stop for a while.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.128
Taylor.

09:49.130 --> 09:52.304
- Janet, do you mind, please?
- No.

09:53.968 --> 09:57.580
Taylor, do you realise that you're attitude
toward Madvig is very embarrassing to me?

09:57.680 --> 09:59.874
- I'm not running for Governor.
- Well, I am.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.877
Your gambling, your night-clubbing
and your drunkenness has got to stop.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.130
- Oh, that's just ducky.
- I mean it.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.350
On Monday I'm gonna find you a job.
If that doesn't straighten you out, I'll...

10:08.399 --> 10:09.992
- Where're you going?
- Out.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.875
Thank you.

10:21.162 --> 10:24.416
Hey, there's Ed Beaumont. Come on.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.087
Come on in, Ed.

10:30.547 --> 10:34.142
Want you to meet Janet Henry.
This is Ed Beaumont.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.953
How do you do?

10:37.053 --> 10:40.123
So you're Mr. Madvig's assistant.

10:40.223 --> 10:44.148
He's more my partner, I'd say.
Anything to eat, Ed?

10:45.103 --> 10:48.882
- Oh, Mr. Henry, do you know Ed Beaumont?
- Oh, yes, yes, I know who you are.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.842
Oh, here are those figures
you wanted for Mr. Henry.

10:50.942 --> 10:54.471
- Oh, yeah, thanks, Ed.
- Won't to stay for coffee, Mr. Beaumont?

10:54.571 --> 10:58.701
Yeah, sure, come on.
Little drop of java will wake you up.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.023
Some coffee for Mr. Beaumont.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.125
- And brandy?
- Thank you.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.654
You know, Ed, I was just telling Janet,
Miss Henry here...

11:11.754 --> 11:13.698
about the time
I was in the newspaper business.

11:13.798 --> 11:17.118
Yes, you were saying you had a job at The
Observer, but you didn't say what it was.

11:17.218 --> 11:21.331
Oh, well, it was sort of like
in the circulation department, you know.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.959
You see, I used to go around the different
newsstands and I'd ask for a paper.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.712
If the guy'd hand me The Observer,
that was okay.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.882
If he'd hand me The Post, I'd slug him.
That was to teach him a lesson, you know?

11:30.982 --> 11:33.885
Oh, you were sort of
an Observer missionary?

11:33.985 --> 11:37.222
No, because a little while later,
I made the same deal with The Post.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.474
Well, how could you serve
both newspapers, Paul?

11:39.574 --> 11:43.561
You see, if the guy handed me The Observer,
I'd slug him for The Post.

11:43.661 --> 11:47.440
If he hands me The Post, I'd slug him
for The Observer. It was very simple.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.069
You certainly were
a two-fisted newspaper man, Mr. Madvig.

11:51.169 --> 11:54.197
- Wasn't he, Mr. Beaumont?
- Yeah, but there was just one hitch.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.741
I used to have to be very careful
about repeating.

11:56.841 --> 12:00.411
But once I missed.
I remember it was on Third and Broadway...

12:00.511 --> 12:03.331
I slugged a guy
for handing me The Observer.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.709
About a week later, I got balled-up
and I found myself in the same spot.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.379
Well, the guy hands me The Post
so I have to slug him again.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.632
You should have seen the expression
on that fellow's face.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.926
There was enough there for an expression?

12:15.026 --> 12:17.762
Oh, sure, I just used to slug him
easy with the left.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.514
But you haven't heard the topper.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.641
Quite a while later when I'd gotten out
of the racket...

12:21.741 --> 12:23.685
I found myself back in the same spot.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.479
Well, the guy saw me coming
and what do you think he handed me?

12:26.579 --> 12:29.566
The Christian Science Monitor.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.318
And you slugged him again?

12:32.418 --> 12:36.969
- No, I didn't have no deal with The Monitor.
- Oh, what a pity.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.118
I must be going.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.911
- Good night, Mr. Henry.
- Good night.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.663
- Good night, Paul.
- See you in the morning, Ed.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.562
I'll see you to the door, Mr. Beaumont.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.320
I'm sorry you're leaving so soon,
Mr. Beaumont.

12:54.399 --> 12:57.949
I'm sure you've have some
interesting stories, too.

13:00.655 --> 13:04.705
I think you've had enough laughs from the
wrong side of the tracks for one evening.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.730
You're hardly the type people laugh at.

13:08.830 --> 13:14.235
- There are people who don't laugh at Paul.
- Oh, he is amusing for a limited time.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.487
To be with him everyday,
how can you stand it?

13:16.587 --> 13:20.241
I get along very well with Paul
because he's on the dead up-and-up.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.060
Why don't you try it sometime?

13:35.565 --> 13:37.217
Ed!

13:37.317 --> 13:38.864
Oh, hello, Opal.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.302
I've been looking all over for you.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.514
I've been slumming with your brother
up at the Henry house.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.808
Ed, I need your help,
I gotta have some money.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.895
Yeah. How much?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.872
All you've got.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.318
Don't ask any questions, Ed.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.820
Please, don't even tell Paul.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.718
All right, Snip.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.430
You're sweet, Ed.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.501
Mr. Varna, please. Taylor Henry.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.761
Hello, Nick. I've got $500 for you.

14:39.921 --> 14:43.516
But, Nick, I'll have the rest
in a couple of days, I promise.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.605
Oh, he's sore. But he'll take the $500.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.326
How can I ever thank you, baby?

15:08.699 --> 15:10.167
Ed!

15:18.459 --> 15:22.134
- Let's go, Snip.
- Now wait a minute.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.461
- Put 'em on.
- Who do you think you are, Beaumont?

15:36.561 --> 15:40.548
- Hurry up.
- I'm not going, you get out of here!

15:40.648 --> 15:42.776
- Sure, with you.
- Taylor, stop him!

15:44.610 --> 15:46.738
Let go of me. Let go!

16:04.547 --> 16:06.470
Here's your key, Snip.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.494
- I hate you.
- You'll outlive it, baby.

16:09.594 --> 16:13.644
- No, I won't ever. Good night!
- I'm coming in.

16:14.724 --> 16:18.336
- To lock me in my room, I suppose.
- Not a bad idea.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.964
You can't stop me from seeing Taylor.
Neither you nor Paul.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.425
I've got a right to happiness
just like anybody else.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.344
- I'm free, white...
- And 18.

16:26.444 --> 16:30.515
What's wrong with being 18?
Lots of girls get married when they're 18.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.183
Why, Taylor's own mother even.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.977
Hey, what are you two barking about
this time?

16:35.077 --> 16:37.956
What's the matter,
didn't they feed you at the party?

16:38.539 --> 16:41.734
Did I hear something about Taylor Henry?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.834
- Have you been seeing him again?
- No, I just happened to mention his name.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.001
You don't have to lie for me.
Yes, I saw him tonight!

16:47.006 --> 16:49.008
After all I've said?

16:50.092 --> 16:52.328
- Where were they?
- In a nightclub.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.415
We weren't. I was at his apartment.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.959
- You were...
- And I don't see what business it is of yours!

16:58.059 --> 17:01.404
You're supposed to be my brother
not a watchdog.

17:02.355 --> 17:06.467
No sister of mine is gonna be taken in by any
cheap, chiselling, tinhorn, playboy like...

17:06.567 --> 17:08.719
He's not a playboy. You know it.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.637
This the first time
you've been to his apartment?

17:10.738 --> 17:13.366
No, it isn't,
I've been there dozens of times!

17:29.298 --> 17:32.326
- Hello.
- Ed! Ed,

17:32.426 --> 17:35.872
Paul's gone up to Mr. Henry's house
after Taylor. He's gonna kill him.

17:35.972 --> 17:39.041
Take it easy, Snip. Paul's not that crazy.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.461
I'd be a chump to go up there
at this time of night.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.529
Now you go to sleep.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.949
I thought you went home.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.052
Did you find Taylor Henry?

18:31.152 --> 18:33.575
- Opal phoned you, huh?
- Yeah.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.413
Did you find him?

18:44.248 --> 18:46.091
I found the old man.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.362
Had a long talk with him.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.840
- Wasn't Taylor there?
- No.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.534
Why?

18:54.634 --> 18:59.014
He's lying outside the house
in the gutter. He's dead.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.194
Yeah, so?

19:06.103 --> 19:08.822
Didn't you understand what I said?

19:09.398 --> 19:11.571
- Sure.
- Well?

19:12.693 --> 19:14.286
Well what?

19:15.571 --> 19:17.369
He was killed.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.816
What do you want me to do about it?
Bust out crying?

19:26.916 --> 19:29.214
Should I call the police?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.697
Don't they know about it?

19:32.797 --> 19:35.767
There was nobody around when I found him.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.770
Thought I'd better see you
before I did anything.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.935
- Is it all right to say I found him?
- Why not?

20:00.908 --> 20:03.331
Ed, you're a fool.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.463
One of us is.

20:14.797 --> 20:18.826
Hey, think I'll ask Janet
if she'd like a lift home.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.620
- I wouldn't.
- Why not?

20:20.720 --> 20:23.974
- She'll want to ride with her father.
- Oh, yeah.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.209
- Hey, Nick.
- Yeah.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.357
- I got an idea.
- What?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.882
- Why don't we knock off Madvig right here?
- What?

20:32.982 --> 20:35.968
Sure, then they don't even
have to move him to bury him.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.072
When I want your advice, I'll ask for it.

20:41.532 --> 20:44.393
I was sorry to hear about Taylor,
Mr. Henry.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.897
- He was a friend of mine, and a nice boy.
- Thank you.

20:47.997 --> 20:51.108
- Could I have a word with you, please?
- What is it?

20:51.208 --> 20:54.779
I suppose you realise that politically
it don't look so good for you.

20:54.879 --> 20:57.156
- Why not?
- Because of Madvig.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.284
The Observer is already hinting
he killed your son.

21:00.384 --> 21:03.037
And it won't be long
before half the state will believe it.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.830
Get a load of that.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.916
How do you like that?
Varna butting in that way.

21:07.016 --> 21:10.044
He's got a nerve.
I think I'll go over and try this out.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.397
Hey, keep your shirt on.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.217
But with me and The Observer
you're a cinch.

21:16.317 --> 21:19.261
- Think it over.
- No, thank you.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.079
Just as you say.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.291
Good afternoon, Miss Henry.

21:36.253 --> 21:39.507
- Where you going?
- I'll meet you at the car.

21:43.177 --> 21:44.645
Miss Madvig?

21:45.513 --> 21:48.082
May I speak to you for a moment?

21:48.182 --> 21:50.685
You loved Taylor, didn't you?

21:52.186 --> 21:55.690
I just heard something
I think you ought to know.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.634
- What about?
- About Taylor's murder.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.281
Hey, Opal!

22:02.571 --> 22:04.369
Ready to go, Snip?

22:05.032 --> 22:08.269
Miss Madvig and I
were having a private conversation.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.855
A funeral's hardly the place
to talk about a murder.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.941
- Even privately.
- It is if you've just heard Nick Varna say...

22:14.041 --> 22:16.736
he had enough evidence
to convict someone of Taylor's murder.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.713
He said that?

22:20.047 --> 22:21.549
Who?

22:22.842 --> 22:24.952
Your brother.

22:25.052 --> 22:29.353
Why don't you peddle your scandal
to someone who wants to hear it?

22:44.822 --> 22:46.974
Don't pay any attention
to that stuff, Opal.

22:47.074 --> 22:50.499
- It's only Nick Varna's way of...
- What's all the gab about?

22:50.995 --> 22:52.167
Hello, Snip.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.127
I know. It's tough.

22:59.420 --> 23:02.156
Come on, move over
and I'll drive you home.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.508
No!

23:26.780 --> 23:29.850
I'm sorry, Mr. Beaumont,
Mr. Farr isn't in.

23:29.950 --> 23:33.354
- When'll he be back?
- Oh, I don't know, he didn't leave word.

23:33.454 --> 23:37.134
- Think I'll take a chance and wait in his office.
- You can't do that! Mr. Farr'll be angry.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.510
Don't you like this job, sonny?

23:48.969 --> 23:50.721
Oh, it's you, Ed!

23:51.180 --> 23:54.583
That crazy kid.
He never gets anything right.

23:54.683 --> 23:57.607
A Mr. Bowman, he told me.

23:59.855 --> 24:03.008
You trying to give me the run-around
now that Paul's in trouble?

24:03.108 --> 24:08.410
No, Ed, you know it's nothing like that.
Here, have a cigar.

24:12.368 --> 24:16.188
You know, Ed, there are some people who think
we're pretty slow in cleaning this murder up.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.790
Yeah?

24:19.583 --> 24:21.301
What have you got?

24:24.463 --> 24:28.684
Here. Take a look at this.
Tell me what you think of it.

24:29.677 --> 24:32.997
Now, I don't attach
any importance to that, Ed.

24:33.097 --> 24:36.692
Nuts are always writing in
anonymous letters on every case.

24:45.025 --> 24:49.305
Ed, for heaven's sakes, you don't think
I'd take that thing seriously, do you?

24:49.405 --> 24:51.181
I just wanted to show it to you.

24:51.281 --> 24:54.768
- You said anything to Paul?
- About the letter? No.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.370
Well, don't.

24:59.289 --> 25:02.793
- What's Nick Varna got?
- He's coming in to see me tomorrow.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.072
Well, I've got to listen to him, Ed.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.618
There's a lot of pressure on this case,
especially from The Observer.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.453
And I can't just sit here and...

25:12.553 --> 25:15.331
If Paul tells you to,
you'll sit, stand or ride a bicycle.

25:15.431 --> 25:19.277
I'm District Attorney of this county!
And I'll...

25:21.395 --> 25:25.716
Well, of course, if you... If Paul...

25:25.816 --> 25:30.012
- If there's any real reason why I shouldn't.
- There isn't any reason.

25:30.112 --> 25:33.491
And I wouldn't like you
to go around thinking there was.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.415
And tonight I'd buy that bicycle.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.240
Hey, get your paper.
Hey, read all about it.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.826
"May call Madvig in Henry murder."

25:52.926 --> 25:56.038
Hey, read all about it, extra, extra.
Hey, get your paper.

25:56.138 --> 25:59.750
"May call Madvig in the Henry murder."
Hey, get your paper.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.524
Hey, read about that Henry murder!

26:03.145 --> 26:05.523
- See The Observer, Paul?
- Yeah.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.525
Well?

26:08.484 --> 26:12.388
Look, do we have to go through that,
"Well? Well what?" routine again?

26:12.488 --> 26:13.639
Not if you don't want to.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.642
Oh, Ed, stop getting your tonsils
in an uproar.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.895
I've had the newspapers after me for years
and I'm still sitting pretty.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.231
You ever tried sitting pretty
in an electric chair?

26:22.331 --> 26:25.150
What are you trying to do, scare me?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.736
The Observer's already talking about
a secret witness.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.214
No, fiddle-faddle.

26:34.676 --> 26:38.455
If Varna's got something,
he's gonna give it to the paper.

26:38.555 --> 26:42.876
He's the one that's spreading all that dirt.
Patch up your trouble with him, Paul.

26:42.976 --> 26:46.505
I'll patch up nothing
with that pop-eyed spaghetti-bender.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.925
He's gotta learn that when I say things
are closed down, they're closed down.

26:50.025 --> 26:54.138
What's good enough for the old Eighth Ward
is good enough for anywhere, huh?

26:54.238 --> 26:56.598
Well, the system has worked pretty good
up to now, ain't it?

26:56.615 --> 27:00.019
- Sorry I bothered you with my nonsense.
- Nonsense is right.

27:00.119 --> 27:04.189
And I don't wanna hear any more guff
about Nick Varna or Taylor Henry neither.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.133
Okay, I'll see you don't have to.

27:26.603 --> 27:27.650
Hello.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.742
What is this, a social service call?

27:40.200 --> 27:43.079
You don't like me, do you, Mr. Beaumont?

27:43.704 --> 27:45.377
I think I do.

27:46.707 --> 27:50.712
I'm pleased.
Even with such qualified approval.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.699
Why are you pleased?

27:55.799 --> 28:00.120
For some obscure reason,
I think you're very nice.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.790
Say the not so obscure reason.

28:02.890 --> 28:05.667
I'd hoped you'd help me find
Taylor's murderer.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.737
Do I look like a guy
that runs down murderers?

28:09.563 --> 28:11.715
You look as though you could.

28:11.815 --> 28:15.194
I'm sure you can tell me one thing
I want to know.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.430
What?

28:18.530 --> 28:21.249
- Did Paul kill him?
- No.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.921
You're sure?

28:30.751 --> 28:35.222
You know you're Paul's best friend,
and you found Taylor's body.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.801
All right, let's have it.

28:39.593 --> 28:42.767
- What?
- The letter. Come on, give.

28:54.608 --> 28:57.886
I got one just like this.
Some half-witted crackpot.

28:57.986 --> 29:01.456
But if it's not a crackpot,
I've got to be sure.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.664
Won't you help me?

29:06.828 --> 29:08.330
No.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.779
I see. You're afraid.

29:15.879 --> 29:19.634
You think Paul'd misunderstand
because you're his friend.

29:20.884 --> 29:25.581
Don't get any such corny ideas.
If I want to help you, or I wanted to...

29:25.681 --> 29:27.875
it wouldn't make any difference
whose friend I was.

29:27.975 --> 29:31.104
- But you said you liked me.
- Sure.

29:31.895 --> 29:35.674
You're built well, got a pretty face,
nice manners.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.969
But I wouldn't trust you
outside of this room.

29:39.069 --> 29:42.573
You're slumming,
and I don't go for slummers.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.058
You think you're too good for me.

29:45.158 --> 29:48.958
Well, sister, it so happens
I think I'm too good for you.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.839
- Who is it?
- Paul.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.334
- Paul...
- In there.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.933
Come in.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.977
Hi, Ed.

30:07.848 --> 30:10.101
Doing a little packing, huh?

30:10.851 --> 30:12.273
Yeah.

30:13.353 --> 30:16.857
- Where you going? New York?
- For a starter.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.076
When you coming back?

30:20.861 --> 30:22.721
One-way ticket.

30:22.821 --> 30:26.808
- Hey, now, look, Ed, if I said anything...
- Got to stop by the jeweller's.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.787
- Wanna come along?
- Yeah, sure.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.883
Travelling alone, huh?

30:36.001 --> 30:37.878
Let's get going.

30:47.429 --> 30:50.603
New York. Kind of cold now.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.900
- Sure you wanna go, huh?
- Tired of hick town stuff.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.299
Meaning me, I suppose.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.359
You know, Ed,
you're awful hard to get along with.

31:01.443 --> 31:03.345
Never said I wasn't.

31:03.445 --> 31:06.181
How about a drink?
Sort of a farewell toast.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.874
Okay.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.064
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi, Paul.

31:14.164 --> 31:15.440
- Hi, Ed.
- Hello, Paul.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.917
Hi, guys.

31:23.006 --> 31:24.724
Couple of beers.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.636
Well, Ed...

31:30.472 --> 31:33.583
I guess you don't think much of me
as a big time politician, do you?

31:33.683 --> 31:37.254
- Figure it out for yourself.
- I've done all right.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.673
I don't think I'm any Napoleon...

31:39.773 --> 31:42.572
but I've come a long way
since the old Eighth.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.454
You think you have.

31:46.071 --> 31:49.516
What do you want me to do, write Nick
a love letter and tell him all is forgiven?

31:49.616 --> 31:51.852
Well, it wouldn't be a bad idea.

31:51.952 --> 31:55.939
Look, Ed, all I know is,
when you start a fight, you finish it.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.400
What are you sticking up
for him for, anyway?

31:58.500 --> 32:00.402
I'm not sticking up for Nick.

32:00.502 --> 32:02.702
I'm just tired of everybody
outsmarting you, that's all.

32:02.796 --> 32:05.240
Who's outsmarting me?

32:05.340 --> 32:07.934
All right, rubber-ears, come on.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.608
Okay, spill it. Who's outsmarting me?

32:16.226 --> 32:18.712
Do you have to ask that?
You're backing Reform...

32:18.812 --> 32:21.292
till you get yourself jockeying
into picking a fight with Nick.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.394
And if that isn't enough,
you play ball with a guy...

32:23.400 --> 32:25.635
who'll dump you overboard
as soon as he's elected.

32:25.735 --> 32:29.556
- All for a snooty dame that wouldn't look at...
- Cut it out!

32:29.656 --> 32:32.267
- Well, I gotta be going.
- Oh, wait a minute, Ed.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.770
- Take your hand off of me.
- Oh, now, cool off, will you? Come on.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.043
- Let go.
- Sit down, Ed.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.690
Get out. Get out!

33:26.922 --> 33:29.892
- Beaumont's here.
- Good, send him in.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.433
Come on in.

33:44.314 --> 33:47.050
Thanks for trying to talk some sense
into Paul.

33:47.150 --> 33:51.304
- I thought he was wrong.
- He'll know he was before I get through.

33:51.404 --> 33:56.518
Now let's get one thing straight. Is this
split between you and Paul for good?

33:56.618 --> 33:59.438
- You sent for me, didn't you?
- Yeah.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.315
- I came, didn't I?
- Okay.

34:02.415 --> 34:05.610
- Got any plans?
- Ticket to New York.

34:05.710 --> 34:09.739
- You can do yourself some good right here.
- How?

34:09.839 --> 34:13.309
You ought to know plenty
about Paul Madvig.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.313
What's your proposition?

34:26.690 --> 34:28.192
Thanks.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.951
Why did Paul bump off young Taylor?

34:35.864 --> 34:39.119
- Nice pooch. How old is he?
- Seven.

34:42.163 --> 34:44.690
You haven't answered my question.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.234
You haven't made your proposition.

34:46.333 --> 34:49.612
I'll stake you
to the finest gambling place in town.

34:49.713 --> 34:52.324
Let you run it to suit yourself
with plenty of protection.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.451
Why would you be getting any protection?

34:54.551 --> 34:58.146
You're not so hot for putting in with me,
are you?

34:59.598 --> 35:01.396
Wasn't my idea.

35:02.559 --> 35:03.981
Sit down.

35:05.395 --> 35:07.022
I tell you what.

35:09.107 --> 35:13.470
I'll give you 10 grand in cash right now,
10 more election night if we beat Paul...

35:13.570 --> 35:16.540
and the gambling house offer still goes.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.644
What do I have to do?

35:20.744 --> 35:24.439
Matthews, the publisher of The Observer,
is outside.

35:24.539 --> 35:28.902
I want you to give him the lowdown on Paul, and
all the dirt on how he's running the city.

35:29.002 --> 35:31.071
Most of it's just routine. Nothing to it.

35:31.171 --> 35:34.241
All right. But there's something
in that Taylor Henry killing.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.514
We could start with that.

35:37.302 --> 35:41.523
- Maybe.
- You mean, we ought to start with 10 grand?

35:49.439 --> 35:50.840
Thanks.

35:50.940 --> 35:53.426
Now, I haven't got much time.
I'll call Matthews in.

35:53.526 --> 35:55.887
Just give him the dope.
He'll put it in shape.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.014
Start off with the money
you gave Opal that night.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.058
- So you know about that?
- Sure, that dough was for me.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.102
I still have some of Taylor's IOUs.

36:02.202 --> 36:05.939
- Say, you didn't bump him off, did you?
- Don't be funny.

36:06.039 --> 36:07.541
Listen.

36:08.041 --> 36:11.945
You followed Opal to Taylor's apartment.
That's an important point.

36:12.045 --> 36:14.698
Give Matthews all the details on that.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.408
Looks pretty good.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.827
You don't think The Observer's printing
a lot of wind, do you?

36:18.927 --> 36:21.371
You know, I thought you were bluffing,
especially by going to Farr.

36:21.471 --> 36:22.789
Not much.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.708
- You know Sloss?
- Yeah, I know him.

36:24.808 --> 36:27.210
Paul tossed him out of the leagues
downtown at headquarters last week.

36:27.310 --> 36:30.630
That's where he made a mistake.
Sloss came to me spouting.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.930
He saw Paul and Taylor
arguing on the street that night.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.426
He only lives a couple of blocks away.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.429
That's good.
But you know Sloss, he'll never stand up.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.658
He won't have to. I got his affidavit.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.070
That's the McCoy all right.

36:54.170 --> 36:57.490
- Where is he now?
- New York. But he'll be back tomorrow.

36:57.590 --> 37:01.828
First, I'm gonna have him talk to Matthews.
Then we'll go and see Farr.

37:01.928 --> 37:05.057
There won't be anybody going to see Farr.

37:07.183 --> 37:10.153
And you can stick this in your ear.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.523
Haddock!

37:14.774 --> 37:16.526
Jeff! Rusty!

37:18.695 --> 37:20.368
Let go, Haddock.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.521
If you want it this way, you can have it.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.715
- Thanks.
- Jeff!

37:38.882 --> 37:41.761
- What do you got?
- Two pair.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.225
That makes four bucks I owe you.

37:50.351 --> 37:54.652
- Must be having bad dreams.
- Yeah, wonder what he's dreaming.

37:55.356 --> 37:58.906
- Well, how you making out, brother?
- Deal 'em.

38:12.957 --> 38:16.653
- Sweetheart, you know what I told you.
- Take it easy, Jeff.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.505
Give me two cards.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.663
Look, sweetie pie, you ought to lie down.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.356
You don't feel so good.

38:31.768 --> 38:34.754
Jeff, be careful.
You're liable to croak him.

38:34.854 --> 38:38.028
You can't croak him. He's tough.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.574
He likes this. Don't you, baby?

38:49.327 --> 38:52.706
- Hiya, Nick.
- Nick. Hiya, Matthews.

38:56.417 --> 39:00.447
The guy's a pip. Every time he comes to,
he gets up and starts something.

39:00.547 --> 39:04.200
Well, isn't all this beating
likely to be fatal?

39:04.300 --> 39:06.536
Not unless we want it to be.

39:06.636 --> 39:09.456
- The water still in the tub?
- It's getting a little dirty.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.274
He won't know it.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.454
He's okay, Nick.

39:37.250 --> 39:39.903
Can you hear me, Ed? This is Nick.

39:40.003 --> 39:44.258
Listen. You're going to give Matthews
the dope on Paul.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.996
All right, I'll have you worked on
until you do.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.957
- Jeff.
- It's a pleasure.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.435
- Nick, please!
- Shut up.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.111
Okay.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.850
It's no good. He's throwed another joe.

40:10.950 --> 40:14.204
All right. We'll be back in the morning.
Come on.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.389
You owe me four bucks.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.640
Okay, ain't it?

40:50.740 --> 40:52.913
- No potatoes?
- No.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.249
Where did you learn how to cook?

42:16.284 --> 42:20.563
My first wife was a second cook
in a third rate joint on Fourth Street.

42:20.663 --> 42:22.085
Oh, yeah?

43:02.121 --> 43:03.815
What's the matter?
Don't you like your steak medium?

43:03.915 --> 43:07.715
When I bite a steak,
I like it to bite back at me.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.182
Rusty!

43:15.093 --> 43:16.811
Bust it open!

43:21.307 --> 43:23.560
There goes the baby. Get him!

43:31.692 --> 43:33.803
Crazy fool! Step on the thing like this.

43:33.903 --> 43:35.576
Turn it over!

44:12.525 --> 44:14.552
Please, we're trying to help you.
You're badly cut.

44:14.652 --> 44:15.678
Get Paul Madvig.

44:15.778 --> 44:18.098
Oh, you'll be comfortable
by the time Mr. Madvig gets here.

44:18.156 --> 44:19.578
Get Madvig.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.602
Hey, what's this all about?
Who wants to see me?

44:22.702 --> 44:25.706
- You can't come in here.
- Look out.

44:29.542 --> 44:32.195
Oh. It's you, huh?

44:32.295 --> 44:35.219
Paul, it's Sloss.

44:36.090 --> 44:39.515
New York trade for Varna.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.397
Big witness.

44:48.102 --> 44:49.729
Passed out?

44:58.154 --> 45:04.082
Look, if that guy dies,
I'm gonna turn this place into a warehouse.

45:15.671 --> 45:17.344
Come in, please.

45:19.342 --> 45:20.969
Hello, Snip.

45:23.512 --> 45:25.498
Oh, you're... You're better.

45:25.598 --> 45:27.942
- Yeah.
- I'm glad.

45:30.603 --> 45:34.048
Ed, what was wrong
between you and Nick Varna?

45:34.148 --> 45:36.822
We just had a little misunderstanding.

45:37.944 --> 45:40.513
Have anything to do with Taylor's murder?

45:40.613 --> 45:42.265
No, it didn't.

45:42.365 --> 45:44.959
Do you know who killed Taylor?

45:45.534 --> 45:47.645
- Did Paul kill him?
- Shut up!

45:47.745 --> 45:48.604
Ed, did he?

45:48.704 --> 45:52.083
If you must be a nitwit,
don't go around with a megaphone.

45:54.961 --> 45:57.071
Then he did kill him.

45:57.171 --> 46:01.325
It would be nice if somebody else
in this town besides me thought he didn't.

46:01.425 --> 46:05.329
It would be especially nice
if that somebody were his sister.

46:05.429 --> 46:08.666
Today's Observer practically said
he killed him.

46:08.766 --> 46:11.460
It wouldn't dare print that
if it weren't true.

46:11.560 --> 46:13.796
Listen, Snip,
you know a lot about newspapers.

46:13.896 --> 46:18.217
Matthews is in with Varna.
They don't want Paul to win the election.

46:18.317 --> 46:21.470
What you saw this morning
is only the start of what's coming.

46:21.570 --> 46:25.808
They're gonna rattle Taylor Henry's bones
until the final vote's cast.

46:25.908 --> 46:30.396
You shouldn't mind. Paul doesn't.
After all, he's a politician.

46:30.496 --> 46:33.191
Matthews wouldn't print it
if it weren't true. He wouldn't!

46:33.291 --> 46:35.043
Snip, he would!

46:36.168 --> 46:39.217
I don't believe you and I never will!

46:52.393 --> 46:53.986
Are you awake?

46:56.814 --> 46:58.090
There's a lady here to see you.

46:58.190 --> 47:00.468
- What kind of a lady?
- Miss Janet Henry.

47:00.568 --> 47:04.263
- Tell her to go away.
- I can't do that. She knows you're better.

47:04.363 --> 47:08.309
- When are we gonna be alone again?
- Never, if I can help it.

47:08.409 --> 47:13.336
- I suppose I'll have to see her.
- No wonder people beat you up.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.712
Come in, please.

47:27.678 --> 47:30.206
Paul says you're feeling much better,
Mr. Beaumont.

47:30.306 --> 47:32.833
They say I'll be able to sit up
by the first of the year.

47:32.933 --> 47:37.797
- Paul said you'll be out in a week.
- Sounds like you've been seeing a lot of Paul.

47:37.897 --> 47:40.716
Let's don't talk about Paul.

47:40.816 --> 47:43.786
- What do we talk about?
- You.

47:44.612 --> 47:47.035
- Comfortable here?
- More or less.

47:47.990 --> 47:50.209
- No fun?
- No fun.

47:51.327 --> 47:55.173
Hasn't your nurse been treating you well?

47:55.623 --> 47:58.923
- Not as well as I'd like.
- Poor boy.

48:00.169 --> 48:03.673
If I'd known you were being neglected,
I would have come sooner.

48:05.716 --> 48:08.661
What's this I heard about coming sooner?

48:08.761 --> 48:11.914
I said if I had known
he was recovering so rapidly...

48:12.014 --> 48:13.666
I would have come sooner.

48:13.766 --> 48:16.419
Way I figured,
Ed's lucky for you came at all.

48:16.519 --> 48:20.274
Oh. Hey, Ed,
Janet made me buy these for you.

48:23.192 --> 48:25.845
- Well, how are you?
- Fine.

48:25.945 --> 48:28.556
How do you like that?
See what comes from having brains?

48:28.656 --> 48:31.017
"Use your brains instead of your fists,"
he's always telling me.

48:31.117 --> 48:32.117
Look what happened.

48:32.159 --> 48:34.270
I go about my business,
he winds up in a hospital.

48:34.370 --> 48:38.065
- Yeah, but think of the rest I'm getting.
- Yeah.

48:38.165 --> 48:42.341
Hey, look. How do you like that? 15 G's.

48:45.798 --> 48:47.721
Congratulations.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.702
Thanks.

48:49.802 --> 48:53.122
We're not announcing it
until after the election.

48:53.222 --> 48:54.690
Oh, no?

48:56.892 --> 48:59.128
- How's everything else going, Paul?
- Oh, fine.

48:59.228 --> 49:01.380
- Keeping Sloss under cover?
- Sure.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.966
I'd get him out of town.

49:04.066 --> 49:06.427
Paul, don't you have to pick up Opal?

49:06.527 --> 49:10.056
Opal? Oh, no.
Opal went to the country for the weekend.

49:10.156 --> 49:11.390
Where in the country?

49:11.490 --> 49:14.560
I don't know. You know,
she acted kind of mysterious about it.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.979
I guess maybe it's just a party
or something, you know.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.815
You better run along anyway.
You have to change for dinner.

49:19.915 --> 49:21.817
Yeah, yeah. Are you coming?

49:21.917 --> 49:23.819
- I'll be along in a minute.
- Okay.

49:23.919 --> 49:27.365
- That is if you don't mind my staying.
- Why should I?

49:27.465 --> 49:32.661
- Well, Ed, do you need anything?
- No. Not a thing.

49:32.761 --> 49:34.934
I'll take these.

49:36.265 --> 49:38.313
Guess you don't at that.

49:41.270 --> 49:44.991
Well, I'll see you later.
Keep punching them.

49:49.069 --> 49:51.472
Do you hate me for this?

49:51.572 --> 49:54.621
Why should I?
You're not dishing it out to me.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.919
You're a strange man.

49:58.579 --> 50:02.709
Tell me, why did you take such a beating
from Nick Varna?

50:03.834 --> 50:06.862
For Paul, on account he pays me.

50:06.962 --> 50:08.447
That's no reason.

50:08.547 --> 50:10.574
Suppose I said
he pulled me out of a river once?

50:10.674 --> 50:13.994
- I wouldn't believe you.
- Okay.

50:14.094 --> 50:18.499
I did it because he's my friend
and he's square. Remember?

50:18.599 --> 50:21.627
And because he would have taken
the same beating for me.

50:21.727 --> 50:24.380
That's what I felt about you.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.799
A stubborn loyalty.

50:26.899 --> 50:29.493
That's why I want you to help me.

50:29.985 --> 50:32.534
- Will you?
- No.

50:33.572 --> 50:38.310
I don't want you around because I'm liable
to start making passes at you.

50:38.410 --> 50:42.131
Besides, that crummy brother of yours
needed killing.

50:56.762 --> 50:58.247
What did you do to her?

50:58.347 --> 51:02.001
She was as near crying
as anybody could be without crying.

51:02.101 --> 51:04.503
I must be losing my grip.

51:04.603 --> 51:07.882
I used to put young ladies into hysterics.

51:07.982 --> 51:11.552
Hey, find out if a guy named Matthews,
who owns The Observer...

51:11.652 --> 51:15.031
- has a place in the country, will you?
- All right.

51:19.451 --> 51:21.419
Thank you very much.

51:26.709 --> 51:28.444
- Where are you?
- Here.

51:28.544 --> 51:31.447
- Matthews has a place near Pine Lake.
- Thanks.

51:31.547 --> 51:32.948
You've got your clothes on.

51:33.048 --> 51:35.868
Well, I can't very well go out
without them. People might talk.

51:35.968 --> 51:37.411
But it's raining out.
You've got a temperature.

51:37.511 --> 51:39.684
Dr. Redmond will never allow...

51:40.472 --> 51:42.691
Send that to Dr. Redmond.

52:49.541 --> 52:52.966
Isn't it kinda wet for you to be out, Ed?

52:53.962 --> 52:57.324
Hey, Rusty, little Rubber Ball is back.

52:57.424 --> 52:59.785
I told you he liked the way
we bounced him around.

52:59.885 --> 53:01.870
I was wondering where you boys were.

53:01.970 --> 53:04.873
What do you suppose gives me
such a boot out of slugging you?

53:04.973 --> 53:08.043
Jeff, you talk too much. Sit down.

53:08.143 --> 53:12.319
Won't you take your coat off
and dry yourself, Mr. Beaumont?

53:13.148 --> 53:14.525
Thanks.

53:19.071 --> 53:22.600
- You're Mrs. Matthews, I take it.
- Yes, I am.

53:22.700 --> 53:26.330
Sit here, Beaumont,
where it's nice and warm.

53:37.756 --> 53:39.742
You feeling all right again, Ed?

53:39.842 --> 53:42.015
- I'm fine, Nick.
- That's good.

53:43.053 --> 53:46.540
You boys can go back to town tomorrow.
You see, we were playing safe...

53:46.640 --> 53:48.917
as long as we didn't know for sure
you weren't gonna die.

53:49.017 --> 53:52.212
I'm glad you've come, Mr. Beaumont.
It's been so dull around here.

53:52.312 --> 53:55.591
- Nobody talking to you and Opal weeping.
- Now, Eloise...

53:55.691 --> 53:58.510
Well, you know she's done nothing but weep
since she talked with you.

53:58.610 --> 54:01.013
- It's been awful.
- Want me to tell you...

54:01.113 --> 54:04.287
- what they're eating their hearts out about?
- Sure.

54:04.950 --> 54:08.170
Opal thinks her brother
murdered Taylor Henry.

54:09.997 --> 54:11.607
That's what she's been talking
to your husband about.

54:11.707 --> 54:13.275
- She's been telling him...
- Ed, don't!

54:13.375 --> 54:15.819
Baby, you're sure one
for getting beat up, ain't you?

54:15.919 --> 54:18.638
Let him talk. It's kind of entertaining.

54:21.216 --> 54:23.702
Well, Opal, am I right?
Isn't that what you were doing?

54:23.802 --> 54:25.304
Please.

54:26.513 --> 54:30.292
Nobody is supposed to talk about it except
you and your brother's other enemies.

54:30.392 --> 54:32.520
He did murder Taylor!

54:33.937 --> 54:35.297
You see?

54:35.397 --> 54:37.966
And of course, your husband
is going to print her accusation.

54:38.066 --> 54:44.348
Not that he believes Paul did the killing,
but he's in kind of a tough spot.

54:44.448 --> 54:47.685
Nick owns the mortgage on The Observer
and he has to do what Nick says.

54:47.785 --> 54:50.604
- Stop it, Beaumont!
- Shut up.

54:50.704 --> 54:54.775
And so, although your husband
doesn't believe Paul is guilty...

54:54.875 --> 55:00.197
he's going to print the story tomorrow,
and it'll carry a lovely wallop.

55:00.297 --> 55:03.992
You can just picture it in black ink
all over The Observer.

55:04.092 --> 55:07.892
Opal Madvig accuses brother of murder.

55:09.807 --> 55:13.919
- Clyde, is that true?
- Well, I...

55:14.019 --> 55:16.714
Here's the funniest angle of it all.

55:16.814 --> 55:20.384
Soon as Nick frames Paul Madvig,
he'll let The Observer go bankrupt.

55:20.484 --> 55:23.579
You see, he doesn't want
to be a publisher.

55:28.367 --> 55:33.230
- Does that mean you're broke?
- I'm afraid it does, darling. I...

55:33.330 --> 55:37.151
Five years. From riches to rags.

55:37.251 --> 55:40.221
It's been quite a ride, hasn't it?

55:55.644 --> 55:58.714
Will you have a drink with me,
Mr. Beaumont?

55:58.814 --> 56:00.111
Sure.

56:01.567 --> 56:03.719
All through, Ed?

56:03.819 --> 56:07.765
- You'd hardly believe how through I am.
- Well, what does it amount to?

56:07.865 --> 56:12.041
It's our turn to hang one on you and Paul
and we're doing it.

56:12.828 --> 56:16.857
The girl came here on her own.
So did Matthews.

56:16.957 --> 56:20.068
So did you.
Now, as far as I'm concerned...

56:20.168 --> 56:23.614
she and you and he can go
wherever you wanna go.

56:23.714 --> 56:25.699
I'm going to bed.

56:25.799 --> 56:27.451
Come on, boys.

56:27.551 --> 56:30.162
Wait a minute.
You mean, I don't get to smack baby?

56:30.262 --> 56:31.538
What for?

56:31.638 --> 56:35.542
He's through as soon as
The Observer comes out in the morning.

56:35.642 --> 56:37.394
Good night, Snip.

56:41.315 --> 56:43.909
Aren't you coming to bed, dear?

56:45.193 --> 56:46.720
Here's how.

56:46.820 --> 56:50.620
Little Rubber Ball does all right,
don't he?

57:12.137 --> 57:15.516
- Should we have another?
- Why not?

57:26.902 --> 57:30.055
Eloise, please come upstairs.

57:30.155 --> 57:33.580
Oh, throw something at him, Mr. Beaumont.

57:43.543 --> 57:45.591
Why should I go to bed?

57:46.213 --> 57:48.090
It's much nicer here.

57:51.134 --> 57:52.452
- Which room?
- What?

57:52.552 --> 57:55.305
- His room. Which is it?
- In front.

58:16.827 --> 58:19.956
- Ed...
- Get your clothes on and get out of here.

58:24.334 --> 58:26.278
Was it... Was it Clyde?

58:26.378 --> 58:28.881
Yeah. Dead as a mackerel.

58:56.783 --> 58:59.561
- Where you going, Ed?
- Thought I'd get a little fresh air.

58:59.661 --> 59:02.665
It's not a bad idea. Wait a minute.

59:03.415 --> 59:06.735
I was thinking it's kinda funny that with
an open ink well and a pen on the table...

59:06.752 --> 59:09.112
we didn't find any writing up there.

59:09.212 --> 59:12.491
What, no writing?
We'll have to discuss that sometime.

59:12.591 --> 59:13.934
Rusty.

59:15.135 --> 59:17.103
This is my pigeon.

59:21.058 --> 59:23.777
Hiya, Big Brain. See what I mean?

59:27.898 --> 59:29.508
Hey, the party ain't over.

59:29.608 --> 59:32.636
We're going out of here, Paul.
If you want to stop us, try.

59:32.736 --> 59:35.580
- Thanks.
- Let him go.

59:37.074 --> 59:38.747
Beat it.

59:40.118 --> 59:43.622
Hey, take your Sleeping Beauty with you.

59:47.834 --> 59:52.010
Well, Ed, you ain't the only one
who gets action on our team, huh?

59:52.672 --> 59:54.366
Matthews just committed suicide.

59:54.466 --> 59:57.786
- Matthews? Here?
- Yeah.

59:57.886 --> 01:00:00.622
Listen, The Observer
is loaded with dynamite for the morning.

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:02.916
Get Judge Thomas on the phone,
have him appoint somebody close to us...

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:06.294
to administer the estate.
He can do it because there's no will.

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:09.006
And have the administrator kill the story.
Get it?

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:11.700
- Yeah.
- Come on, fellow. Don't wait.

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:18.515
But, Paul, I can't make my boys
vote the Reform ticket?

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:22.165
Why not?
Most of them come from a reform school.

01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:26.398
- Paul.
- Hey, I'm good. How are you?

01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:29.192
Hey, we'll give a stop
to Murphy and Kelly.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:30.944
Hey, look, you're not supposed to be
running around like this.

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:32.237
I thought you were supposed
to stay in bed.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:35.157
I just got a tip from Farr's office.
He's gonna bring you in for questioning.

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:37.159
Take it easy, will you?

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:39.419
What can that over stuffed pelican
question me about...

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.996
now we got The Observer shut up?

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:42.723
What about Sloss?

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:44.833
- Tutt.
- Yes, Paul?

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.543
Donovan and Burns are out
picking him up now.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:47.711
They ought to be in any minute.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.546
- You got Sloss' ticket?
- Yes, Paul.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.173
Good.

01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:54.342
I'm sending him up to Maine
for a nice, long rest.

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:56.720
I wouldn't be too sure about Farr.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.930
We need to buy
some more of those anonymous letters.

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.533
He doesn't think much
of the ticket's chances.

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:04.252
Well, he don't, huh?

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:07.689
Maybe I better go down and give
that beetle-nose a little pep talk.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:09.416
Hey, wait a minute.

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:11.526
Look, you feel strong enough
to come along?

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.469
- Sure.
- Let's go.

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:16.615
- Oh, Tutt.
- Yes, boss.

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:19.910
When Sloss gets here, put him in my office
and see that nobody gets to him.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.353
Yes, Paul.

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:34.816
Hiya, Sloss.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:37.827
Take him up to Tuttle.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:45.143
- Why, it's Sloss.
- That came from your window, Paul.

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:47.120
Let me get to him.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:55.675
What the hell? Paul! What's the matter?

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:07.394
No use, Paul. He could have
gotten out six different ways.

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:13.855
Yes, you're right.

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:23.431
I suppose they'll pin this one on me, too.

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:25.767
Why not? Sloss was a big witness.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:29.020
No one had a better reason
to get rid of him than you.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.751
Paul, you got to go to Farr and tell him
all you know about the Taylor Henry murder.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:36.361
Think up something else.

01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:38.572
- Are you covering up for someone?
- No.

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:40.157
Well, then you better talk.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.601
- I can't talk.
- Why not?

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:48.773
I killed Taylor Henry.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.800
- Would you tell me how it happened?
- It was an accident.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:03.013
He was at the house when I was talking
with old man Henry about Opal and him.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:06.558
He followed me down the street
and started the argument all over again.

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:08.310
He took a poke at me.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:12.540
I smacked him and he fell
and crushed his skull on the kerb.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:17.402
Certainly gummed things up
keeping quiet all this time.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.446
Why did you?
You had a perfect self-defence plea.

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:23.471
I didn't want that. I want Janet Henry.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:27.078
Ed, I want her more than I've ever
wanted anything in my life.

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:29.258
What chance would I have with her
if she knew that...

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:34.169
More chance then than you have now.
More chance of beating the rap, too.

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:36.213
Farr'll never touch me.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:37.714
Listen, if he thought it would
do him any good...

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.091
he'd arrest his own mother
and get a conviction.

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:43.161
And those letters have got him
plenty worried.

01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:47.725
I thought so.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.374
So you put up with Paul,
be polite to him...

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:58.420
for the sake of the political backing
your father needed. That was easy.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.923
Then she decided Paul killed her brother,
was going to escape punishment...

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:06.386
but even then she played along.
That's splendid.

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:11.182
Paul's sister and his sweetheart, both
trying to steer him into the electric chair.

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:14.227
He certainly has a lot of luck
with his women, doesn't he?

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:15.729
I wrote those letters.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:19.858
I'm sure Paul killed Taylor
and I'm going to prove it.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:23.278
What do you think Paul's going to do
when I tell him about all this?

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:27.407
You're not going to tell him.
What good would it do?

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:30.431
Beside you're too fond of him to hurt him.

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:33.788
And there's another reason.

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:36.482
I'm asking you not to.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.756
Can't you forget about Paul for a minute?

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:45.508
I thought we'd settled all that.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:49.429
I told you once, Paul wouldn't make
any difference if I wanted you.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:51.473
But I don't.

01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:55.310
You still think you're five points better
than Paul and four better than me.

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:58.163
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:04.049
Now that we understand each other,
let's get out of here.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:09.341
Extra! Read all about it. Extra! Paper!

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:16.557
Hi, Al. Hi, Jim.

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:27.109
Hi, Ed. Well...

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:31.971
looks like you were right about that
swivel-neck Farr.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:34.574
Really been putting it to you,
haven't they?

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:40.021
- Did he get that indictment?
- Yeah, don't you worry.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:44.067
We're getting a writ of habeas corpus, there
ain't a judge in this town that'll hold me.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.647
Any judge'll hold you
if you don't come through with the truth.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:49.047
Oh, you too, huh?

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:53.263
- Did you have Sloss bumped off?
- No.

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:56.913
- What about Taylor?
- I told you about that.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.124
Yeah, you told me.

01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:03.545
You told me you were keeping quiet
for Janet Henry. Well, that's crazy.

01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:06.881
- She doesn't even like you.
- Don't start that again.

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:09.801
I'm telling you, she's been trying
to shove you into the electric chair...

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:12.220
by writing anonymous letters
to Farr and everybody else.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.822
That's enough.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:18.685
What is this, Ed?
You trying to get her for yourself?

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:24.399
- I'm tired, go on, get out of here.
- I'll get out when I finish talking.

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:26.568
You'll get out when you're told to.

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:29.672
- This is the kiss-off.
- Okay, Paul.

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.245
- Say, Ed?
- Yeah?

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:40.999
I took your advice. I got that bicycle.

01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:43.022
My kid's riding it.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:38.014
- Give me a fresh beer, Joe.
- Coming right up.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:39.113
Give me another one.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:54.756
Well, if it ain't "Sock me again"
Beaumont.

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:08.106
Hello, Jeff.

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:15.365
Hey, gang. Meet the swellest guy
I ever skinned a knuckle on.

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:20.658
- We're gonna have a little drink.
- Okay.

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:26.207
Nah, not with these mugs.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:29.792
I got just the place for me and you.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:35.947
A little room upstairs that's too small
for you to fall down in.

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:38.491
I can bounce you around off the walls.

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:43.267
That way, we won't be wasting a lot of time
while you get up off the floor.

01:09:44.846 --> 01:09:49.694
Excuse us, gents.
We got to go up and play handball.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:52.772
Me and Cuddles.

01:09:57.902 --> 01:09:59.575
Sit down.

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:08.146
Go on, sit in any chair you wanna sit in.

01:10:08.246 --> 01:10:10.898
If you don't like that one,
take another one.

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:14.319
I want you to consider yourself my guest.

01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:16.888
We'll have a couple of drinks.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:20.450
And then I'm gonna knock your teeth out.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:23.578
- Nothing wrong with this chair.
- You're a liar.

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:27.854
There ain't a chair in this dump
worth a dime. Look.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:36.484
See, Beaumont. You don't know
a cockeyed thing about chairs.

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:42.451
- My error.
- Ah, a wise guy.

01:10:43.948 --> 01:10:46.100
You think I'm drunk.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.978
- No, you're not drunk.
- I am drunk.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:53.629
I'm drunker than you are.
I'm drunker than anybody in this dump.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.590
What'll it be, gents?

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:05.186
Where you been?
I rung for you an hour ago.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:11.584
I bring the best friend I got
in the world up here for a drink...

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:15.463
and we got to sit around waiting
a half an hour for a broken down waiter.

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:16.964
What do you want?

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:19.408
- Rye.
- Scotch.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.557
And don't get the idea
I don't know what you're up to, either.

01:11:26.657 --> 01:11:30.978
I'm not up to anything. I'd like to see
Nick, and so I thought I'd find him here.

01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:36.109
That's a lie. You don't care where Nick is.
It's me you're after.

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:38.528
I know what you're up to.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:41.280
You're a heel, that's what you are.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:46.978
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna beat the hide off of you.

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:58.781
Here's looking at you.

01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:02.743
I don't wanna look at you. You're a heel.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.496
All right, have it your way.

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:10.560
You think it's a smart trick coming up here
and trying to get me to talk.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.270
About what? Sloss?

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:16.065
You know what I think about that guy.
You ought to get a medal.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:20.361
- How'd it happen?
- Oh, no, wise guy.

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:23.990
Little Jeff ain't talking about that.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.242
- Why not? A secret?
- Yeah.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:31.873
A secret. Between me and Nick
and the lamp post.

01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:34.208
And you ain't no lamp post.

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:37.938
- You're a heel.
- Buy you a drink.

01:12:41.732 --> 01:12:43.780
Ain't a bad idea.

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:52.418
But you are still a heel.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:56.422
And I'm still gonna knock your block off.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:13:02.300
Don't worry about me.
Nick's got everything fixed.

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:05.965
- Rye.
- Scotch.

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:12.079
I wouldn't bank too much on Nick.
Remember he let McMurry fry.

01:13:12.179 --> 01:13:14.582
Well, I'm not McMurry.

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:18.503
A swell chance with all I've got on Nick.

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:20.776
What have you got on him?

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:26.677
He thinks I'm drunk enough to tell him.

01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:28.905
Go on, tell him, Jeff.

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:34.018
Hi, Nick. Meet Mr. Beaumont.

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:37.563
- He's a heel.
- I told you to stay undercover.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:40.733
This whole joint's undercover, ain't it?

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.610
- Hello, Beaumont.
- Hiya, Nick.

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:45.964
- Get much out of him?
- No, not much.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:50.184
I think you're a pair of heels.

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:52.678
- They've had enough.
- Scotch!

01:13:59.393 --> 01:14:03.819
You talk too much with your mouth, Jeff.
I told you that before.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:07.385
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm talking to you, Jeff.

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:09.053
Well, quit talking to me.

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:12.807
You know, we're coming to a place
where I am gonna quit talking to you.

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:15.080
Don't be a heel, Nick.

01:14:16.077 --> 01:14:20.799
- You're just burned because I killed Sloss.
- Sit down and shut up.

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:24.339
Don't paw me.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:38.875
- Got the roscoe?
- Yeah.

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:43.401
Now you see what we got to do?
We got to give him the works.

01:14:47.358 --> 01:14:49.656
Take it easy, Jeff.

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:03.549
I'm just a big, good-natured slob.

01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:07.970
Anybody can push me around
all they want to...

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:11.595
and I never do anything about it.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:29.241
Let's blow. Give me the roscoe.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:35.578
- What kind of a heel are you?
- Sit down.

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:37.870
Sit down.

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:44.878
Remember I owe you something?

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:49.087
Put your hands on the table.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:54.388
What a half smart guy
you turned out to be.

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:05.358
Get the cops. Better get a doctor, too,
in case Varna's not dead.

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:08.439
Better get an undertaker in case he is.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:19.826
- All right, boys. Put him on ice.
- Hold it a minute.

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:26.540
So long, sweetheart.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:34.824
- Funny man, huh?
- Yeah. You're gonna die laughing.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.244
- Take it easy.
- All right, boys.

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:37.910
The show's all over, clear out.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:42.289
That was pretty slick, Ed.
Pinning that Sloss killing on Jeff.

01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:44.858
Thanks for giving me those bobs.

01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:48.838
They tell me your wife's folks
live in Omaha.

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:52.675
Yeah, they got a nice quiet little place
up there. I like it.

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:55.803
Better wire them that you
and the missus are on the way.

01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:57.826
What is this? A rip?

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:03.123
- Just a piece of pretty good advice.
- Well, I don't get it.

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:05.730
Why don't you get smart?

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:07.773
Tomorrow Paul's gonna beat
that indictment you hung on him...

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:10.192
and the first guy he reaches for
is gonna be you.

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:13.029
In a pig's ear he'll beat it.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:17.384
Okay. But when he nails your ears
over the courthouse door...

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:20.348
don't say I didn't warn you.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:26.250
Hey, Ed. Ed, wait a minute.
Ed, wait, wait. Now, look.

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:30.421
I'm not arguing. See? All I'm asking...

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:33.257
is how is Paul going to beat the rap?

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:35.676
Will you listen to me
or do I have to write it down?

01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:37.178
In the first place there isn't
a judge on the bench...

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:38.929
who'd dare hold Paul
now that the Sloss thing is cleared up.

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:40.029
Well, but...

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:42.308
And in the second place,
and hold on to this one...

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:45.227
it wasn't Paul that killed young Henry.

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:48.731
- Hey, how did you figure that out?
- By that talk I had with him in the hoosegow.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:51.358
We got down to cases
and he told me he did it.

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:55.821
- But... But that don't add up.
- Look, rummy, it adds up swell.

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:58.481
If Paul had done it, he wouldn't
have waited till now to tell me.

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:00.868
He's covering up for someone.
Taking the rap.

01:18:00.968 --> 01:18:04.811
Taking it for someone extra special.
If you'll do like I'll tell you...

01:18:04.911 --> 01:18:08.310
we'll make the pinch and you can
postpone that trip to Omaha.

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:18.820
Say, Ed, are you sure you know
what you are talking about?

01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:23.891
I knew what I was talking about
when I brought in Jeff, didn't I?

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:25.288
Yeah.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.539
Yeah. Well, what do you...

01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:34.552
- What do you want me to do?
- Swear out a warrant for murder.

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.872
- Who's the party?
- Janet Henry.

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:50.292
Janet Henry. Janet Henry?

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:54.463
Why, that's the old man's daughter!
That's young Taylor's sister!

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.563
Why, that's the girl...

01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:57.299
That's the girl that Paul's
been covering up for.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.552
- Oh, well, I couldn't do...
- Listen to me.

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:01.762
I got on her like a car load of bricks.

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:03.514
It started when she jumped her brother
about Opal...

01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:05.614
and ended up with young Henry
where they found him.

01:19:05.658 --> 01:19:08.227
All along Paul's known she did it
and he's been covering up for her.

01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:10.146
And all along she's hated Paul's guts...

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:13.357
and hated him for himself and
for the stranglehold he had on the family.

01:19:13.457 --> 01:19:15.734
She's the one that's been circulating
those poison-pen letters.

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:19.114
Running off at the mouth to Matthews. Trying
to shove Paul into the electric chair.

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:22.266
I tell you, it's got to be her.
So get busy.

01:19:23.842 --> 01:19:27.830
Say, you're not talking about
just ordinary people, Ed.

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.807
This is Janet Henry.

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:34.187
I want no part of it.

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.173
Better have, Farr.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:40.926
There's only one guy that ever kicked Paul
in the pants and got away with it.

01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:43.554
McCluskey, remember?

01:19:43.654 --> 01:19:48.501
And he jumped 18 floors into Centre Street
before Paul got at him.

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:07.953
- What is it?
- I want to see Miss Henry.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:09.371
- At this time of night?
- Yeah, this time of night.

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:10.706
- I couldn't possible disturb her.
- Then I'll do it.

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:12.499
That's out of the question,
you can't possibly...

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:14.210
I can't... You can't come in here.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:16.587
What is it, Peter?
What's the matter? Beaumont.

01:20:16.687 --> 01:20:18.881
- I wanna see your daughter.
- I'm afraid you are overstepping yourself.

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:21.050
Get her down here or I'll go up
and drag her out of bed.

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.384
I'd better call the police, Mr. Henry.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:25.804
- You don't have to. They're already here.
- What?

01:20:25.904 --> 01:20:28.515
- You gonna get her or will I have to?
- Ed.

01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:31.393
- What is it?
- Okay, Farr, there's your party.

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.729
Oh, I don't know, Ed, now. I've...

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:36.565
Mr. Farr, I must ask you
to explain this intrusion.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:41.028
- You see, Mr. Henry, it was like this...
- Ed, what does this mean?

01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:44.098
It means Farr has a warrant
for your arrest.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:47.243
Arrest? What for?

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:49.578
- The murder of your brother.
- Why, man, you're crazy.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.498
- You'll have to prove it.
- That's absurd.

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:54.959
On whose evidence
was this preposterous warrant issued.

01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:58.939
- My evidence, and brother, it's hot.
- Ed?

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.574
Okay, Farr, take her along.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.641
All right, go on up and stand by
while she gets her clothes.

01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:12.434
Wait.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:15.562
I think, Mr. Farr,
you'd better prepare another warrant.

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:17.585
I'm the one you want.

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:20.376
I killed my son.

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:27.866
I... I followed Taylor and Paul
after they quarrelled here at the house.

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:30.327
I caught up with him in the street.

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:33.956
I told Taylor that he was
ruining my political career.

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:37.501
He struck me.
He was going to strike again.

01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:40.713
Well, we... We scuffled.

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:43.692
Somehow, he... He fell...

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:47.077
and his head hit the kerb.

01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:49.864
When Paul and I lifted him up...

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.913
he was dead.

01:21:54.326 --> 01:21:57.170
- It was an accident.
- And Paul?

01:21:58.122 --> 01:22:01.001
I made him promise not to say anything.

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:12.141
I was getting worried. Afraid we'd have to
hang the girl to make the old man crack.

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.147
Excuse me, please.

01:22:16.515 --> 01:22:18.208
I'm glad to see you beat it, Paul.

01:22:18.308 --> 01:22:20.169
Yeah, the whole thing was a frame,
eh, Paul?

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:23.380
It's good to get out of that cage,
I can tell you. Well, I'll see you later.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.923
Who you gonna run for Governor
in place of Henry?

01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:28.093
I haven't picked him yet. But whoever
it is, you can bet on him for a winner.

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:29.490
That's right.

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:44.088
- Take those first.
- Yes, sir.

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:49.990
Ed, I had to come.

01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:52.513
I want you to take me with you.

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:56.264
Ed...

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:59.541
there's no use pretending.

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:02.461
You love me and you know it.

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:05.464
No matter what you'd say
to the contrary...

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:08.989
there'd always be something
inside of me that would say you were lying.

01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:11.995
But Paul?

01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:16.917
- No, I...
- You owe him plenty.

01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:19.249
Paul's been fine.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:24.003
And in my heart,
I'll always be grateful to him.

01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:28.842
But if I'm married in gratitude,
it would be all I'd have for him.

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:33.550
The answer's still no.

01:23:34.468 --> 01:23:38.080
Still leaves us on different sides
of the tracks.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.478
Let's dynamite those tracks.

01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:51.990
Take me with you.

01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:06.467
You two got it bad, huh?

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:12.924
Well, what are you waiting for, you goon.

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:15.033
Are you kidding?

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:17.536
What do you want me to do?
Run out and bring you a preacher?

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:20.856
Come on, get going
before I change my mind.

01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:23.599
Hey.

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:34.453
I suppose you think I'm nuts?

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:36.955
No, the other one.

01:24:39.616 --> 01:24:44.167
But if you figure on getting married
with my rock, you're nuts.
