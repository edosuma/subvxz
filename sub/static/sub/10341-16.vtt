WEBVTT

01:36.763 --> 01:40.432
Now, Dale, listen carefully.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.477
It's your move.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.688
Please put your heart into it,
will you?

01:46.856 --> 01:49.900
I've noticed a certain tentative quality
in your thinking,

01:50.068 --> 01:52.945
as if your mind were occupied
with issues

01:53.113 --> 01:54.905
other than those on the board
before you.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.534
Such preoccupation
not only weakens one's resolve,

01:58.701 --> 02:01.245
but one's foresight as well.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.330
A deadly failing in any match,
you must agree,

02:03.498 --> 02:08.877
but in this particular contest,
quite disastrous,

02:09.045 --> 02:12.297
as we play for grave stakes,

02:12.507 --> 02:16.135
the likes of which
you have no doubt surmised.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.264
Print your move in tomorrow's paper.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.933
Or I will make it for you.

02:23.184 --> 02:27.563
That tears it. Cooper,
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

02:27.730 --> 02:30.899
Harry, if Windom wanted to kill me,
I'd already be dead.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.903
Yeah.

02:35.488 --> 02:39.074
- Better get Pete on the horn.
- Right.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.578
Lucy, call Pete Martell,
get him over here right away.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.037
Then call the paper.

02:44.205 --> 02:48.000
Find out the latest possible deadline
for tomorrow's personals column.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.502
Paper and Pete, got it.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.379
I'll do it alphabetically.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.012
She was beautiful.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.018
She was the love of my life, Harry.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.900
Okay, Lucy.

03:13.067 --> 03:16.862
Okay, yeah, just tell Harry
I'll be right there, okay?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.572
Right.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.043
- Aah! Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.588
Ah? Ah?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.302
Peter.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.804
Salt and pepper.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.307
Coming right up, poodle.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.687
You two bring out the worst
in each other.

03:50.855 --> 03:55.609
- Oh, Pete's a prince of a man.
- A court jester.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.864
Well, I've got to mosey.

04:11.793 --> 04:17.714
Goodbye, you sweet Packards.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.763
Oh, Catherine.

04:24.931 --> 04:28.767
Catherine, I'd always have hoped
that time and age would mellow

04:28.977 --> 04:31.603
that tempest raging inside you.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.231
Watching you two act
like the Hardy Boys

04:34.399 --> 04:37.276
always brings on stormy weather.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.987
What's happening with Ghostwood?

04:40.154 --> 04:42.030
I talked to the investors,
the meeting is set.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.532
I leave for Paris tomorrow.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.286
Oh, company.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.247
- Dear Josie...
- Huh!

04:55.211 --> 04:57.045
I'm home, did you miss me?

05:01.592 --> 05:03.885
Oh, she looked surprised.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.222
Poor Josie.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.558
Oh, she has her charms, though.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.935
Yes, but not for long.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.118
Come in.

05:30.121 --> 05:33.248
- Hi, Harry.
- Save it, Hank.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.502
What happened? Did you get up on
the wrong side of the bed this morning?

05:37.670 --> 05:40.213
So I broke parole. Cry me a river.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.342
You crossed the border into Canada.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.802
You consorted with the drug dealers
at Dead Dog Farm.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.305
You tried to kill somebody.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.059
I'm charging you with
the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.685
Ouch.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.897
Well, I think it's safe to assume
that I was at the diner

05:57.065 --> 05:58.774
the night that Leo was plugged.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.026
- But you're welcome to call...
- I got a witness.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.612
Puts you at the scene
with a gun in your hand.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.740
Harry, you obviously seem serious
about this,

06:06.908 --> 06:11.411
so I'm going to propose a trade.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.914
How about information
leading to the arrest

06:14.082 --> 06:18.251
and conviction
of Andrew Packard's murderer?

06:18.544 --> 06:22.464
Hank Jennings,
witness for the prosecution.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.092
No deals.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.927
You're telling me
you're more interested

06:27.095 --> 06:30.347
in the attempted murder
of Leo Johnson, felon,

06:30.515 --> 06:32.015
than Andrew Packard?

06:32.183 --> 06:34.309
How's that gonna sit
with your constituents?

06:34.477 --> 06:36.395
You're through, Hank.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.689
My guess is, Harry, not too well.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.359
Especially once they find out
who pushed the button on Andrew

06:42.527 --> 06:44.820
and that you're sleeping with her.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.037
Gee, I'm sorry.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.164
Get him out of here.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.874
Get him out of here!

07:02.338 --> 07:04.131
Give me that.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.305
This is the bullet
we removed from you.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.058
This is the one that was excavated
from the dead man's skull.

07:15.226 --> 07:19.396
Same bullets, same gun, same killer.
Let's go get her.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.773
- Albert, hold your horses.
- Coop,

07:21.941 --> 07:24.860
I appreciate any reluctance you have
for busting your pal's old lady,

07:25.027 --> 07:27.779
but the woman ventilated you
and left you for dead.

07:27.947 --> 07:31.450
Albert, I don't take it personally.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.493
What about the gloves,
the powder tests?

07:33.661 --> 07:35.537
News at 5.
All right, fine, you're not mad,

07:35.705 --> 07:37.706
but there's an epidemic
of multiple gunshot wounds

07:37.874 --> 07:40.375
following this chick around.
She is a menace.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.877
I'll talk to her.

07:42.044 --> 07:44.838
Maybe she'll confess, turn herself in.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.508
Maybe she'll grow wings
and join the circus.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.902
Randy, I've got a list
of all our non-repeat guests.

08:07.069 --> 08:10.238
We're gonna send them a special
invitation to the Great Northern.

08:10.406 --> 08:13.366
Your enthusiasm brings
a salty tear to the eye.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.826
However,

08:14.994 --> 08:17.245
I think you will find my job requires
a little more

08:17.413 --> 08:20.332
than a tight sweater
and a perky attitude.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.292
Randy, I'm learning the business.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.961
Every week a different department.
I don't want your job.

08:25.129 --> 08:28.465
Yes, I look forward
to your stint in housekeeping.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.052
This came for you this morning.

08:33.012 --> 08:36.890
Good luck, Miss Horne.
You'll need it.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.575
Hi.

08:56.118 --> 09:00.288
- I just checked into Room 215.
- Congratulations.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.792
Strange, they told me at the front desk
I should talk to you.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.294
What is it I can do for you?

09:06.462 --> 09:08.588
Sorry, thought you were working.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.757
I am working.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.885
I'm working, see?

09:14.262 --> 09:15.554
I see.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.389
Audrey.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.979
- Horne?
- At your service.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.814
Could you send someone out
to the airport?

09:25.982 --> 09:28.024
I'm traveling with some
heavy equipment this trip.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.734
Didn't have enough room in the van.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.445
- What flight were you on?
- My own.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.699
On the jet out there.
Shouldn't be hard to find.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.329
Is there anything else I can do
for you, Mr. Rockefeller?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.624
No, thank you.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.751
Yeah.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.796
I have a picture of you.

09:49.964 --> 09:53.258
You're wearing a little dirndl skirt, got
a white apron on, you have pigtails.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.759
It's unbelievably cute.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.430
I don't wear dirndl.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.432
You did then.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.436
It was right here.
The Great Northern dining room.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.107
If I close my eyes,
I can almost see it.

10:09.817 --> 10:13.278
Little Audrey Horne as Heidi.

10:17.825 --> 10:21.536
Well, anyway, it's unforgettable.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.707
Heidi.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.335
I was 10. Hey!

10:30.713 --> 10:33.214
Thank you.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.904
"Save the one you love.

10:56.072 --> 10:59.908
Please attend gathering of angels
tonight at the Road House, 9:30."

11:11.629 --> 11:13.505
Nadine?

11:17.885 --> 11:20.428
Honey, what are you doing home
from school?

11:20.596 --> 11:22.514
Are you feeling poorly?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.474
Don't.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.520
Don't what?

11:28.854 --> 11:32.315
Oh, Eddie. We have to talk.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.317
Okay.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.904
Mike and I are in love.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.078
- In love?
- I hope you're not hurt.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.792
I wouldn't wanna hurt you
for anything in the world.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.545
Honest, you have to believe that.

11:54.130 --> 11:58.341
But Mike and I, on that wrestling trip,

11:58.718 --> 12:03.888
we had the most
magical night together.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.141
All night?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.187
Well, you and Norma did it.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.442
Well, that's fair.

12:17.486 --> 12:18.862
So, what's this mean?

12:21.407 --> 12:23.199
Eddie.

12:24.410 --> 12:29.414
We have to call a spade a spade.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.751
We're breaking up.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.671
Eddie,

12:37.631 --> 12:40.341
I'm so sorry.

12:48.642 --> 12:52.645
Josie, I want you to level with me
about what happened in Seattle.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.439
I told you.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.066
How many times
do I have to say it?

12:57.234 --> 13:00.361
I escaped from Jonathan
in the airport

13:00.529 --> 13:03.656
and I don't know
what happened to him after that.

13:03.824 --> 13:06.743
Do you understand
I could arrest you right now?

13:06.911 --> 13:09.120
I came here as a friend of Harry's.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.540
Now, I don't know what place
he occupies in your heart,

13:12.708 --> 13:15.668
but I do know that you own his.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.963
I would think you'd like a chance
to explain yourself to him.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.965
Please go.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.311
This is the end of it, Josie.
There are no other options.

13:36.982 --> 13:40.151
I want you at the station house
by 9:00.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.529
Or I come and find you.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.543
Oh, Josie,
I just saw Agent Cooper leave.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.628
Was this a social call?

14:05.845 --> 14:09.222
Dear, you look awful.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.392
Is everything all right?

14:12.560 --> 14:16.062
- I don't feel very well.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.648
I wish I had better news.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.359
I've spoken to Mr. Eckhardt again
on your behalf.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.278
While he's not
entirely unsympathetic,

14:23.445 --> 14:26.197
he does insist on seeing you alone.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.200
Tonight.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.494
He'll kill me.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.246
To tell you the truth,

14:33.455 --> 14:35.290
my biggest worry is
what he's going to do

14:35.457 --> 14:38.209
when he finds out
that Andrew is alive.

14:38.377 --> 14:41.546
Won't Mr. Eckhardt think
that you've betrayed him?

14:41.839 --> 14:43.965
But of course, you can tell him
that you didn't.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.927
After all, you did actually think
that Andrew was dead.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.763
Oh, no.

14:53.434 --> 14:57.145
I don't know. I don't know.

14:57.313 --> 15:02.317
Heh. Maybe you can help me.
I think I'm going mad.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.032
You will simply have to face
Mr. Eckhardt

15:09.199 --> 15:11.326
sooner or later.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.078
Tell him the truth.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.249
Tell him whatever you want.

15:24.214 --> 15:28.134
Just pray that he believes you.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.179
Oh, there they are.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.925
No answer. He must be on his way.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.426
Thanks, Bobby.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.762
Look, why don't you join us?

16:12.930 --> 16:14.347
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:14.515 --> 16:19.811
You know, board meetings are usually
nothing more than a gathering

16:19.979 --> 16:21.854
of self-minded individuals,

16:22.022 --> 16:24.649
each more intent
than the other on financial gain.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.109
No, thank you.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.027
But today...

16:28.445 --> 16:31.781
Today is going to be
something completely different.

16:33.325 --> 16:38.037
Am I late? Hot dog, Ben,
look at you. How are you?

16:40.457 --> 16:43.751
- You are a sight for sore eyes.
- Look who's talking.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.295
- We taking good care of you?
- The best.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.423
My luggage arrived.
Thank you, Audrey.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.052
- You two have met?
- Briefly.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.347
John Justice Wheeler.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.224
Used to be in construction.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.435
- Came up the hard way.
- How nice.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.104
You remember my brother Jerry?

17:03.313 --> 17:05.314
- That is Jerry. Oh, my God.
- Hi, Jack.

17:05.858 --> 17:10.278
And this is, uh, my executive assistant,
Bob Briggs.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.155
- Bob.
- Hey, what's up?

17:12.322 --> 17:15.491
- Pleasure.
- Why don't you all just take a seat?

17:16.243 --> 17:22.331
I've, uh, asked Mr. Wheeler
to join us on the board.

17:23.333 --> 17:27.336
Years ago,
I made an investment in him,

17:27.504 --> 17:28.880
a pittance,

17:29.048 --> 17:31.466
which he built into an empire.

17:31.633 --> 17:35.094
Now, I don't take any credit,

17:35.387 --> 17:39.098
but I believed in Jack

17:39.266 --> 17:43.102
even when he was a local boy
pounding nails.

17:43.270 --> 17:47.690
I've asked him to return the favor
and believe in me now.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.861
Ben, you're testing
my well-worn modesty.

17:53.947 --> 17:56.657
All right, suffice to say,

17:56.825 --> 18:01.829
Horne Industries Incorporated
have fallen on hard times.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.456
The mill,

18:03.624 --> 18:07.585
the Ghostwood lands, are now
solely owned by Catherine Martell.

18:07.795 --> 18:11.464
We don't begrudge her,
the mill was and is, after all, hers.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.674
So,

18:13.884 --> 18:16.511
in spite of these reversals

18:16.678 --> 18:20.348
and, uh, stripped of all the trappings
of success,

18:20.516 --> 18:21.808
what are we left with?

18:23.185 --> 18:25.144
The human spirit.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.528
What is the greatest gift

18:33.695 --> 18:37.490
that one human being can give
to another?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.371
The future.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.292
I give you...

18:51.296 --> 18:54.841
...the little pine weasel.

18:55.384 --> 18:59.554
Found only in our tri-county area,

19:00.472 --> 19:02.473
it is nearly extinct.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.226
- They're incredible roasted.
- Ahem.

19:05.853 --> 19:10.064
According to an environmental
impact report,

19:10.315 --> 19:14.652
what few pine weasels remain
will be all but wiped out

19:14.820 --> 19:18.281
with the Packard plans
for Ghostwood development.

19:18.490 --> 19:22.410
So you wanna save the weasel?

19:22.619 --> 19:24.704
No, Bobby.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.957
Not just the weasel.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.211
But life as we know it.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.840
I want Twin Peaks

19:36.008 --> 19:38.551
to remain unspoiled

19:38.719 --> 19:42.930
in an era
of vast environmental carnage.

19:43.140 --> 19:47.185
So we block Catherine's development
until the wheel turns

19:47.352 --> 19:48.644
and we get another shot.

19:48.812 --> 19:51.731
That's brilliant, Ben. That's brilliant.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.193
I plan to fight

19:55.360 --> 19:58.529
this Ghostwood development
on every ground

19:58.697 --> 20:02.074
and with every available weapon.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.829
The little pine weasel...

20:07.915 --> 20:12.251
...is about to become
a household word.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.255
Then what?

20:19.092 --> 20:23.638
Then I am considering

20:23.805 --> 20:26.224
a run for the Senate.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.525
Thank you.

20:46.161 --> 20:49.538
Annie, it's no problem.
I've got plenty of room.

20:49.706 --> 20:53.209
You just get on the next bus, okay?
And I'll be waiting.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.462
Oh, honey, don't cry.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.881
It's gonna be all right.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.925
I'll see you soon.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.969
I love you too.

21:03.136 --> 21:04.845
Bye.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.809
- So your sister coming?
- Tomorrow.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.980
God, what do you have to do
to get out of a convent?

21:14.356 --> 21:16.774
You just leave, it's not a prison.

21:16.942 --> 21:21.195
Sounds like prison to me.
No TV, no boyfriends.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.948
You know, when she was little,
I always used to think

21:24.116 --> 21:27.285
that Annie was
from another place and time.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.413
I guess the convent has been good
for her in a way.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.791
Hard to imagine her out in the world.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.962
Oh, look, here's something for you.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.549
- Who from?
- I guess who was ever sitting there.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.471
Look at this.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.515
"Mountains kiss, waves clasp.

21:49.683 --> 21:53.436
Flower, sunlight, the moonbeams,
is all this, thou kiss."

21:53.603 --> 21:54.895
None of this makes sense.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.607
"Save the one you love.

21:58.775 --> 22:02.194
Please attend a gathering of the angels
tonight at the Road House, 9:30."

22:02.446 --> 22:04.905
Sounds intriguing in a way,

22:05.073 --> 22:06.699
but it sounds dangerous.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.786
I wonder who this is from.

22:25.761 --> 22:29.055
Norma Jennings, I've loved you
every day for the past 20 years

22:29.222 --> 22:31.640
and I dream about you every night.

22:31.808 --> 22:34.018
It's time for us to be together.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.270
Will you marry me?

22:36.480 --> 22:39.565
- Ed?
- We deserve to be happy.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.276
It's our turn, baby.

23:16.603 --> 23:20.231
All night long I held her in my arms

23:20.399 --> 23:25.069
Just to keep her
From the foggy, foggy dew

23:25.237 --> 23:27.613
Good job, fella.

23:27.781 --> 23:30.116
Good boy.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.620
Just a few more, and then we'll eat.

23:34.788 --> 23:39.458
Fly to my breast,
Pierce me in colors autumnal,

23:39.626 --> 23:43.421
speak to me only of love.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.966
Leo, you have
an incomplete education.

23:47.134 --> 23:50.136
For instance,
survival in the wilderness?

23:50.303 --> 23:52.555
A relevant issue in your life,
my friend.

23:52.722 --> 23:58.227
Now, this comes under the heading
of practical instruction.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.729
I hope you've been paying attention.

24:00.897 --> 24:01.981
Ow.

24:02.899 --> 24:03.983
Whoo.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.485
Nature is cruel.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.947
This is also a lesson.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.759
Hi, honey.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.095
How are you feeling?

24:34.598 --> 24:38.767
Oh, great, now that you're here.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.523
Hank, I came here
to ask you for a divorce.

24:46.443 --> 24:50.571
Well, first let me say,
I don't blame you.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.282
You gave me a second chance
and I blew it.

24:54.284 --> 24:57.244
I don't know
why I'm so self-destructive,

24:57.454 --> 24:59.371
but I can see

24:59.539 --> 25:02.458
that that's my priority in getting well.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.668
I got a lot of work to do.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.587
In fact, I decided

25:06.755 --> 25:09.423
I'm gonna try to go into therapy.

25:10.133 --> 25:12.301
I don't wanna be like this anymore.

25:14.721 --> 25:17.056
That's very interesting, Hank.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.059
But I have to get on with my life.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.231
I know.

25:26.816 --> 25:28.901
I know you do.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.570
I just want you to be happy.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.656
Thank you.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.620
I want you to do me one last favor.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.039
I want you to help me
get out of here.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.669
If they send me back to prison,
I'll die.

25:47.003 --> 25:48.837
Tell the sheriff
that I was at the restaurant

25:49.005 --> 25:51.090
the night
that Leo Johnson was shot.

25:51.258 --> 25:54.552
I was on my way home.
I can't prove it, but you can.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.345
No more lies, Hank.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.306
It's not lying,
it's trying to save my life.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.475
No.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.855
You're killing me here, Norma.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.858
Don't blame this on me.
Don't you dare.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.111
Is it Ed?

26:12.279 --> 26:13.696
Is that who you're running to?

26:18.618 --> 26:20.327
Okay.

26:21.162 --> 26:22.496
Then here's the deal.

26:23.623 --> 26:27.543
You give me my alibi
and I give you your divorce.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.588
I didn't come here
to negotiate with you.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.423
This is it, it's over.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.383
Fine.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.262
Go ahead.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.017
You're his whore, Norma.

26:45.061 --> 26:50.107
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife.

26:54.946 --> 26:58.824
Norma!

27:00.118 --> 27:03.996
Now, there are four or five
different ways of doing this thing,

27:04.164 --> 27:06.123
and they all have their virtues.

27:06.291 --> 27:10.294
I remember Capablanca and Lasker,

27:10.462 --> 27:13.005
St. Petersburg, 1914...

27:13.173 --> 27:14.548
- Pete.
- Yeah.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.383
We've only got five minutes.

27:16.551 --> 27:18.594
All right.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.555
- Lucy.
- Sheriff?

27:21.723 --> 27:22.973
Get the Gazette on the phone.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.559
Tell them not to close out
the personals. We need more time.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.604
- The Gazette.
- Okay.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.482
That's it.

27:31.941 --> 27:35.402
Guaranteed to cause
some sleepless nights.

27:35.570 --> 27:37.863
As long as he can't remove
another piece from the board.

27:38.031 --> 27:41.617
He can't do it.
Not at least for five, six more moves.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.744
Maybe he'll kill anyway.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.914
- Maybe it'll just frustrate him.
- I don't think so, Harry.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.792
Earle has a perverse sense of honor
about these things.

27:49.959 --> 27:53.462
I never heard of a man
who murdered by the rules.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.005
Coop?

27:55.632 --> 27:56.882
Albert.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.219
Good work, Pete.

28:05.308 --> 28:07.434
Here it is, straight up.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.688
I got a match on the gun that
whacked you with the powder residue

28:10.855 --> 28:12.398
on Josie Packard's gloves.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.608
Seattle police have also
come up with an eyewitness

28:14.776 --> 28:17.820
who positively ID'd Josie leaving
the car where they found the stiff.

28:17.987 --> 28:19.530
If you ain't gonna bust this bitch,

28:19.698 --> 28:23.659
- I would consider it a personal...
- Albert, I can handle it.

28:34.921 --> 28:37.005
I think you just did.

28:48.643 --> 28:50.352
Come in.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.032
I assume
you still have a taste for bubbly.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.785
We've killed enough bottles
in our time.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.749
To beginnings.

29:12.375 --> 29:15.461
And endings, and the wisdom
to know the difference.

29:17.338 --> 29:20.048
I am sorry, Andrew.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.261
I hated you at first, of course.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.972
Perfectly normal response.

29:31.978 --> 29:35.272
As my anger diminished,

29:35.440 --> 29:39.401
I recalled that Eckhardt has a way
of persuading people to do anything.

29:39.569 --> 29:43.197
- It was his idea, of course.
- Yes.

29:43.823 --> 29:46.116
He made me do it.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.660
And he said you never loved me.

29:48.828 --> 29:51.747
You just married me
to get back at him.

29:51.956 --> 29:53.624
That's not true,
I did love you very much.

29:55.084 --> 29:58.545
Of course,
the same cannot be said for you.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.047
Please, Josie,

30:00.215 --> 30:02.758
let there be no more lies between us.

30:03.009 --> 30:07.679
You had a job to do and you did it.
Now you're paying the price.

30:07.847 --> 30:10.224
Every action has its consequence,
my dear.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.144
The police are closing in.
If you don't take action,

30:14.312 --> 30:17.356
you'll be sleeping in a jail cell tonight.

30:17.524 --> 30:20.192
What can I do? Please help me.

30:20.401 --> 30:22.069
You must see Eckhardt.

30:24.113 --> 30:27.825
Perhaps you were meant
to be together all along.

30:28.326 --> 30:31.119
I'm sure he truly loves you.

30:33.122 --> 30:36.875
He doesn't know I'm alive.
He can get you out of this country.

30:39.295 --> 30:41.505
Go to him, Josie.

30:43.758 --> 30:45.425
Now.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.599
Andrew.

30:53.434 --> 30:55.727
We won't speak again.

31:15.164 --> 31:18.417
Hi.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.128
It's beautiful.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.965
I wanted us to go someplace
we've never been before.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.259
Come on.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.555
How did it go with the police?

31:31.723 --> 31:34.808
They asked a million questions
that I didn't know the answers to.

31:34.976 --> 31:37.978
But the ones I did
must have been enough.

31:38.855 --> 31:42.316
Evelyn's gonna stand trial
and I'll be a witness.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.486
You're not wearing the ring.

31:46.654 --> 31:49.114
I know about you and Evelyn.

31:51.618 --> 31:54.077
I wouldn't blame you
if you hated me.

31:54.746 --> 31:58.373
James,
I know what you were feeling.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.876
I was feeling it too.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.295
Evelyn just took advantage of it.

32:04.005 --> 32:07.174
Well, it was wrong
and I should've known that.

32:07.342 --> 32:12.387
Look, it's okay for you to feel bad
about what happened to you,

32:12.555 --> 32:14.598
but I don't want you to feel bad
for me.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.935
If we could just start over again...

32:19.354 --> 32:21.438
Please come home with me.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.899
I can't. Not right now.

32:29.781 --> 32:33.450
You're right. You should go.

32:36.412 --> 32:38.121
But what about you?

32:38.331 --> 32:40.999
Can't worry about me anymore.

32:41.584 --> 32:43.377
I've been a part
of all the horrible things

32:43.544 --> 32:45.379
that have happened.

32:45.546 --> 32:48.590
I wanna be a part
of something good now.

32:50.885 --> 32:52.302
James, go.

32:52.512 --> 32:55.055
Take all the time you need.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.140
I love you.

32:59.394 --> 33:02.270
I'm gonna miss you like crazy.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.731
But you'll go away

33:04.899 --> 33:06.775
and you'll come back
with great stories.

33:07.902 --> 33:12.239
And none of them are gonna be
about Laura or Maddy or Evelyn.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.283
And I'll be here.

33:16.786 --> 33:20.330
- Come with me.
- No.

33:23.209 --> 33:26.670
Well, then, I'll come back, I promise.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.374
Coming.

34:06.669 --> 34:08.420
Coming.

34:16.637 --> 34:19.598
- Pete, I need to see Josie.
- Come on in.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.893
- I think she's gone out.
- Yes, it's rather odd.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.853
She took my car
without saying a word.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.189
Well, she told me
the Great Northern.

34:27.607 --> 34:30.108
Oh, did she? Well,
she took a lot of things with her.

34:30.276 --> 34:31.610
I don't know where she was going.

34:31.778 --> 34:34.780
But I'd say she was planning
to stay a while.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.698
What else did she say, Pete?

34:37.867 --> 34:41.328
Well, that she was going to see
an old friend.

34:41.621 --> 34:42.954
Who?

34:46.334 --> 34:48.960
Sheriff, I suppose it's been very hard
on all of us

34:49.128 --> 34:51.379
learning the truth about Josie.

34:52.715 --> 34:55.175
Catherine.

34:55.343 --> 34:56.760
Who?

34:58.304 --> 35:01.681
Eckhardt. Thomas Eckhardt.

35:03.309 --> 35:05.143
Poor man.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.784
Lobby, please.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.166
Thomas.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.421
We meet again.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.843
I don't believe in ghosts.

35:38.052 --> 35:40.137
Pity, it's an appealing notion.

35:40.304 --> 35:43.807
The return of the grisly phantom
from the grave.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.852
You deserve haunting, to be sure.

35:47.436 --> 35:50.230
Look closer, Thomas.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.899
I'm alive!

35:54.443 --> 35:56.111
How?

35:56.279 --> 35:58.822
Guess. It's really very simple.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.199
Josie.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.119
She warned me off herself.

36:04.287 --> 36:07.747
Couldn't bear to see
her beloved husband perish.

36:07.915 --> 36:09.416
Or more realistically, I suppose,

36:09.584 --> 36:11.793
she felt there was
some advantage to be gained.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.254
She betrayed me.

36:15.506 --> 36:18.341
We're all familiar with betrayal.

36:18.759 --> 36:21.678
Josie is mine. She belongs to me.

36:21.888 --> 36:27.475
Oh, Thomas,
love will break your heart.

36:27.977 --> 36:31.855
Happily, long ago, I lost interest.

36:32.732 --> 36:37.110
But Josie loses her heart
with alarming regularity.

36:37.278 --> 36:40.030
The local sheriff, of all people.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.200
- I have taken care of that.
- I don't doubt it.

36:44.076 --> 36:47.996
Sometimes I wonder
if our Josie

36:48.164 --> 36:50.749
does these twisted things
deliberately.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.751
Don't you?

36:54.712 --> 36:57.964
As someone
who was once your friend,

36:58.132 --> 37:00.759
I come back with a warning.

37:01.761 --> 37:04.054
Josie is coming back to you,
be very careful.

37:05.598 --> 37:08.350
I'm always careful.

37:10.311 --> 37:13.021
Well, here we are, the lobby.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.398
I'll be going back down
to the garage.

37:15.566 --> 37:18.944
My resurrection remains
a well-kept secret.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.910
Thomas.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.039
Bye.

37:35.836 --> 37:41.132
Hmm.
I know that I have a lot to learn.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.718
Jack,

37:43.886 --> 37:46.304
you shall be my teacher.

37:46.472 --> 37:50.267
Think of me as an open book,

37:50.434 --> 37:53.728
upon whose virgin pages
you shall scribe.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.442
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

38:00.861 --> 38:05.740
So, Mr. Wheeler, um,
what is it exactly you do do?

38:05.908 --> 38:07.826
First off, call me Jack, please.

38:07.994 --> 38:11.371
I buy bankrupt, failing businesses.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.581
I streamline them,
bring them back up to speed

38:13.749 --> 38:15.959
and then usually sell them.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.669
At a substantial profit.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.337
But not, I should add,

38:19.505 --> 38:22.590
before making significant
environmental concessions.

38:22.758 --> 38:28.263
No, when Jack is finished,
the waste is rerouted, the air...

38:32.143 --> 38:36.563
The air is cleaner.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.189
And the people happier.

38:38.357 --> 38:41.192
Ben, you make me sound
like Santa Claus.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.820
I'm a businessman, that's all.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.196
Hmm?

38:48.284 --> 38:52.329
You'll have to excuse me,
the chef just tried to stab Jerry.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.456
You kids carry on.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.374
Pay attention.

39:03.257 --> 39:04.674
So, Mr. Wheeler,

39:04.842 --> 39:07.677
which is it,
are we bankrupt or just failing?

39:07.845 --> 39:10.555
I came to do an old friend a favor.
And it's Jack.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.725
My father's friends are rarer
than the pine weasel.

39:14.977 --> 39:16.227
Well, let's just say

39:16.395 --> 39:18.521
that Ben was once
a very good friend to me.

39:19.106 --> 39:21.483
So you came back
to bring us all up to speed.

39:21.650 --> 39:25.195
You are Santa Claus, Mr. Wheeler.
I'd better hang up my stocking.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.283
You don't like me very much,
do you, Audrey?

39:33.621 --> 39:35.622
I don't have an opinion either way.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.333
But if you did?

39:39.377 --> 39:40.627
If I did,

39:40.795 --> 39:43.797
I'd say that the Hornes have managed
to take care of themselves just fine

39:43.964 --> 39:45.382
for more years than you can count.

39:45.591 --> 39:47.384
And desperate
though we may seem,

39:47.551 --> 39:50.595
will probably continue to do so
in the foreseeable future.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.312
Indeed.

40:03.192 --> 40:05.735
Where have you been all this time?

40:05.903 --> 40:08.863
I mean, when you weren't busy
rescuing widows and orphans

40:09.031 --> 40:11.908
and making our world
a better place to live in.

40:14.036 --> 40:15.578
The far corners of the earth.

40:17.039 --> 40:19.916
I tell you, it's glorious out there,
Audrey.

40:22.586 --> 40:26.464
All in all, it's good to be home.

40:29.802 --> 40:32.387
I'm only 18.

40:33.681 --> 40:36.724
And what exactly does that have to do
with the price of eggs?

40:37.685 --> 40:39.644
Nothing.

40:42.857 --> 40:44.774
God, look at the time.
I have an appointment.

40:44.942 --> 40:47.110
- Could you tell my father?
- Sure.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.237
Okay. Um, see you.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.865
Bye.

40:55.870 --> 40:58.037
I'll see you later, Jack.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.835
I'll see you, Audrey.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.554
Hmm.

41:19.268 --> 41:22.020
- Shelly? Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

41:22.188 --> 41:24.856
I'm okay. How are you doing?

41:25.024 --> 41:27.901
You know life. Drag?

41:28.152 --> 41:30.445
Are you waiting for James?

41:30.613 --> 41:31.905
No.

41:32.072 --> 41:34.908
Actually I got this really weird note.

41:35.075 --> 41:37.494
Somebody wants me
to meet them here.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.662
That strange?

41:39.997 --> 41:43.082
That is strange, look what I have.

41:43.876 --> 41:46.252
It looks like
we all have something to talk about.

41:48.214 --> 41:49.964
It fits.

41:50.966 --> 41:55.386
See the mountains kiss high heaven,
And the waves clasp one another

41:55.554 --> 41:59.682
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdain'd its brother

41:59.850 --> 42:04.020
And the sunlight clasps the earth,
And the moonbeams kiss the sea...

42:04.188 --> 42:08.775
What is all this sweet work worth,
If thou kiss not me?

42:09.652 --> 42:11.986
- This is weird.
- I'll say.

42:32.591 --> 42:35.510
Cooper here. Yes, Catherine.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.888
No, no, I was just on my way over.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.099
She's here?

42:41.892 --> 42:44.227
Thomas Eckhardt's suite.

42:45.145 --> 42:46.896
I see.

43:00.786 --> 43:02.579
Help!

43:02.913 --> 43:04.455
- Please help.
- I love you.

43:04.623 --> 43:07.000
- No!
- Josie. For God's sake...

43:07.167 --> 43:10.587
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me! Don't hurt me.

43:35.237 --> 43:36.487
Stay where you are.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.123
He tried to kill me.

43:47.416 --> 43:50.960
Is that what you'll say about me,
Josie? That I tried to kill you?

43:51.962 --> 43:53.963
What about Jonathan?

43:54.131 --> 43:55.798
Did he try to kill you too?

43:55.966 --> 43:59.218
He was taking me back.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.679
Why did you shoot me, Josie?

44:02.431 --> 44:04.766
Because you came here.

44:04.933 --> 44:07.268
I knew this day was going to come.

44:07.436 --> 44:10.438
I'm not going to jail. I can't.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.317
Put it down, Josie.

44:16.236 --> 44:19.364
- Harry.
- Put it down!

44:19.573 --> 44:22.533
Harry, forgive me.

44:22.701 --> 44:25.203
I never meant to hurt you.

44:38.550 --> 44:41.761
Josie. Josie.

44:42.471 --> 44:43.721
Josie.

44:49.478 --> 44:50.978
She's dead.

44:54.483 --> 44:55.817
Josie.

45:10.082 --> 45:15.253
Coop, what happened to dead Josie?

45:45.451 --> 46:00.006
Oh, Josie.
