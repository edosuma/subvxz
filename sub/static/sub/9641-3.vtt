00:06.212 --> 00:10.980
Okay. What I'm about to attempt
is the very advanced,

00:11.014 --> 00:16.297
not for everyone, don't try this at home...
...Thin Man spell.

00:16.334 --> 00:18.974
Great. It's a spell that will
make Justin thin and a man.

00:21.782 --> 00:23.250
A man...

00:23.285 --> 00:24.653
Sorry.

00:24.688 --> 00:26.490
I'm just happy someone made a weight joke

00:26.524 --> 00:27.992
and it wasn't about me.

00:30.832 --> 00:32.534
OK. Here we go.

00:34.573 --> 00:37.110
HaHair frizzy, don't
have a tizzy, thin Lizzy.

00:39.318 --> 00:41.622
Sweet!

00:46.332 --> 00:48.371
Is this a part of the spell?

00:48.405 --> 00:52.075
No, it's not. Hello, Russos.

00:52.110 --> 00:56.184
I hope you remember me,
because I bothered to remember you.

00:58.288 --> 01:00.958
I am here to congratulate Justin Russo.

01:00.992 --> 01:04.129
He just mastered his 5000th spell,

01:04.164 --> 01:07.067
marking end to his wizard studies.

01:07.101 --> 01:10.739
Go ahead. Celebrate. Let it all out.

01:10.773 --> 01:12.474
I did it. I'm done.

01:12.509 --> 01:13.877
Now put it back in,

01:13.911 --> 01:16.081
because I have 30 more of
these I have to do today.

01:18.318 --> 01:20.556
I can't believe you're done.

01:20.590 --> 01:25.491
It feels like just yesterday you
were turning a brick into a rabbit.

01:25.525 --> 01:27.193
Edgebono-utoosis.

01:27.227 --> 01:28.594
Oh!

01:29.830 --> 01:31.197
Sir, sir?

01:31.232 --> 01:33.834
How many spells have I
successfully completed?

01:33.868 --> 01:36.671
Oh, we don't like to keep track of numbers.

01:36.705 --> 01:39.641
Two hundred. Give or take a hundred.

01:39.676 --> 01:41.844
So, a hundred.

01:43.747 --> 01:45.749
Yes!

01:47.452 --> 01:50.121
So then, I guess this party is for me, too.

01:52.057 --> 01:53.925
I'm so proud of you, Justin.

01:53.959 --> 01:57.429
You know, go get a piece of pie,
any pie you want,

01:57.463 --> 01:58.964
from the pie fridge.

01:58.998 --> 02:01.400
- You earned it, son.
- Awesome.

02:01.435 --> 02:03.536
I've completed my entire wizard studies

02:03.570 --> 02:05.505
and I'm getting a slice of pie.

02:07.341 --> 02:08.741
Hold on a second.

02:08.776 --> 02:12.045
With the completion of
your basic wizard studies,

02:12.079 --> 02:14.982
you now move on to the next
step in becoming a wizard.

02:15.016 --> 02:17.584
- Independent study.
- Ooh!

02:17.619 --> 02:19.153
Nice going, Justin.

02:19.187 --> 02:23.424
You finished school just to
be rewarded with more school.

02:23.458 --> 02:27.129
Mr. Stuffleby, what sort of independent
study did you have in mind?

02:27.163 --> 02:29.699
I could go on and on and on but, frankly,

02:29.733 --> 02:32.302
my lips are getting a bit tired.

02:32.336 --> 02:35.740
But off the record, they're so far behind,

02:35.774 --> 02:38.577
you might as well be
competing with that chair.

02:38.611 --> 02:41.080
Whoops! No offense, chair.

02:42.483 --> 02:44.317
- Now, that was a good one.
- Yeah.

02:44.351 --> 02:45.619
It was.

02:45.653 --> 02:49.056
Hey, this competition's not over yet.

02:49.090 --> 02:50.690
Don't count out me and Max.

02:50.724 --> 02:52.623
Yeah, I'm smarter than that chair.

02:52.658 --> 02:54.692
I take its money all the time.

02:57.229 --> 02:58.896
Take that, chair.

03:02.762 --> 03:04.563
Well, don't count out me.

03:59.716 --> 04:01.349
Hey.

04:01.383 --> 04:04.451
So I decided on what independent
study course I'm gonna take.

04:04.485 --> 04:08.088
It's a course called, "Ha, ha.
I'm beating you in the wizard competition."

04:10.057 --> 04:11.824
That was a good one.

04:13.326 --> 04:14.826
Just kidding, in all seriousness,

04:14.861 --> 04:16.427
the course is called monster hunting.

04:16.461 --> 04:19.463
Oh, great. Then you can round
up all your ex-girlfriends.

04:19.497 --> 04:21.998
Oh!

04:22.800 --> 04:24.234
Now get out of here.

04:24.268 --> 04:26.970
I'm trying to find a way to
catch up on my wizard lessons.

04:27.004 --> 04:28.738
Why bother? You know, if I were you,

04:28.772 --> 04:31.540
I'd figure out ways to
look good in a hair net.

04:31.575 --> 04:32.908
Whoo!

04:32.943 --> 04:34.643
I am on fire.

04:36.046 --> 04:39.914
Alex, I thk he just called
you a hairy lunch lady.

04:42.117 --> 04:46.252
Dude, aren't you just a little worried that
Justin might beat us in the wizard
competition?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.086
Alex, I'm worried about a lot of things.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.088
This might be as tall as I get.

04:52.191 --> 04:53.590
Look, what are we gonna do to beat him?

04:53.624 --> 04:55.258
I'm not telling you.

04:56.794 --> 04:58.060
Harper.

04:58.095 --> 05:00.096
- I need help with my studying.
- Ah-ha!

05:00.130 --> 05:01.530
That's what you're doing.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.500
I'm not doing that.

05:07.370 --> 05:09.270
When you called and said
something about studying,

05:09.305 --> 05:12.573
I thought you were being held against
your will and forced to say crazy stuff.

05:12.607 --> 05:15.876
No, no. I really need
help on my wizard lessons,

05:15.910 --> 05:17.676
and so I can catch up to Justin.

05:17.710 --> 05:18.910
Catch up to Justin?

05:18.944 --> 05:20.711
Well, then you need to change who you are.

05:20.746 --> 05:22.346
You're gonna need to do what Justin does.

05:22.381 --> 05:25.317
Harper, I've spent my
entire life ignoring him.

05:25.351 --> 05:26.985
I don't know what he does.

05:27.019 --> 05:29.254
Hey, then I can help you.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.655
There's no bigger expert on Justin than me.

05:31.690 --> 05:34.157
He and I used to go out just a little bit.

05:35.526 --> 05:37.994
- No, you 't.
- Can't you go along with it?

05:38.028 --> 05:39.495
I'm trying to help you.

05:40.931 --> 05:42.798
Fine. OK, fi. Tell me what he does.

05:42.832 --> 05:45.333
OK, Justin is always learning.

05:45.367 --> 05:46.967
He's constantly quizzing himself.

05:47.002 --> 05:49.069
For example, when you think he's texting,

05:49.104 --> 05:52.305
he's really sending spells
to himself to memorize.

05:52.340 --> 05:55.708
I knew he wasn't that popular.

06:04.517 --> 06:06.685
Hey. Whatcha doing?

06:06.719 --> 06:08.519
Studying.

06:09.488 --> 06:12.523
OK. Right.

06:16.161 --> 06:18.628
Yes! My monster hunting kit
came in the wizard mail.

06:18.663 --> 06:22.232
You chose monster hunting
as your independent study?

06:22.266 --> 06:26.034
That's fantastic.
It's so exciting and dangerous.

06:26.069 --> 06:28.136
And, oh, gosh. I'm so proud of you.

06:28.170 --> 06:30.137
You got a homing beacon!

06:31.306 --> 06:32.873
Yup. They sent everything.

06:32.907 --> 06:36.408
A monster detector, a manual
that lists all known monsters.

06:36.442 --> 06:41.345
Oh, and some sort of illuminated
communication device.

06:41.380 --> 06:43.247
Hello.

06:44.782 --> 06:47.683
I think that's a flashlight, Dad.

06:47.718 --> 06:49.887
Then why am I speaking into it?

06:54.193 --> 06:55.160
Ooh!

06:55.761 --> 06:57.095
Here.

06:57.129 --> 06:59.633
They sent the monster bait.

07:04.775 --> 07:06.008
- -
- Wow.

07:06.042 --> 07:08.176
You know, I think you're
suppose to put that bait

07:08.211 --> 07:10.378
on this giant key ring.

07:10.413 --> 07:12.347
Dad, that's a sparkly, spinning hoop.

07:13.081 --> 07:14.048
Oh...

07:14.082 --> 07:15.616
Hey.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.586
- Dad?
- Yes.

07:27.793 --> 07:30.962
OK, so, according to the monster manual,

07:30.996 --> 07:33.196
the local monster holding cells are located

07:33.231 --> 07:35.198
at Grand Central Station.

07:37.435 --> 07:38.968
Look how they spelled "station."

07:40.437 --> 07:42.604
That is how you spell station, Dad.

07:44.974 --> 07:46.808
Oh, look, wanted posters.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.177
OK, uh... Ooh.

07:50.211 --> 07:52.311
Look at this cute little guy.
It's a Dirksen.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.147
He'd be an excellent first target.

07:54.181 --> 07:55.848
Here he is. A Dirksen.

07:55.882 --> 07:58.784
Disguises himself as a common household pet.

07:58.818 --> 08:01.186
- Mm-hm. - When cornered, triples in size,

08:01.220 --> 08:03.655
trapping its prey, squeezing its farts out.

08:05.991 --> 08:07.258
Whose farts?

08:08.193 --> 08:10.127
He's killing you, Justin.

08:10.161 --> 08:12.696
Does it really matter whose
farts it is? - Well, yeah.

08:13.998 --> 08:17.333
Um, maybe we should start
with the level one monster.

08:17.368 --> 08:19.602
OK. OK, here we go.

08:19.636 --> 08:22.104
A Fakeahorseus. This looks like an easy one.

08:22.138 --> 08:25.472
A cowardly monster, good,
whose only tools for survival

08:25.507 --> 08:28.609
are sarcasm and complaining.

08:28.643 --> 08:29.643
You can catch that.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.678
- I mean, you grew up with Alex.
- Yes.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.748
You're going down, Fakeahorseus.
I'm gonna go lay some bait.

08:37.850 --> 08:41.652
You are a lucky kid. Monster hunting.

08:41.686 --> 08:45.955
It's adventurous and dangerous
and you're out there...

08:45.990 --> 08:47.757
- You can't go, Dad.
- But why?!

08:49.326 --> 08:52.361
Because you thought this was
a communication device...

08:52.395 --> 08:54.663
...and this was a key ring.

08:54.697 --> 08:57.099
It's just... How could you
even fit that in your pocket?

08:57.133 --> 08:58.133
It's just not logical.

09:03.671 --> 09:05.572
I'm gonna go get my keys.

09:17.852 --> 09:19.786
Well, Justin'll be out
monster hunting all day,

09:19.820 --> 09:21.721
so we'll use his room
to learn how he learns.

09:21.755 --> 09:24.524
Check it out. He reads himself
to sleep with a spell book,

09:24.558 --> 09:26.826
and his mp3 player is full of spells.

09:28.595 --> 09:31.730
<i>?T×³ Pine nuts, basil, dragon toes are h
ow you make a potion ?T×³</i>

09:31.764 --> 09:33.764
<i>?T×³ When someone drinks it they will turn
into a... ?T×³</i>

09:33.799 --> 09:35.599
Yeah, OK, no, we're done with that.

09:37.469 --> 09:40.737
He's even designed his room to help
him learn spells. Try the fridge.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.441
<i>- -  To open the fridge,</i>

09:44.476 --> 09:47.243
<i>recite a spell that changes hot into
cold.</i>

09:49.645 --> 09:53.413
- I don't know that spell.
- OK, try to turn on this lamp.

09:54.549 --> 09:56.116
OK.

09:56.150 --> 09:58.451
<i>- -  Here's a bright idea.</i>

09:58.486 --> 10:02.221
<i>If you want the lamp to come on,</i>

10:02.256 --> 10:03.922
<i>create a ball of light.</i>

10:05.525 --> 10:07.292
If I could create a ball of light,

10:07.326 --> 10:09.894
I wouldn't need to turn the lamp on.

10:09.928 --> 10:12.696
Harper, I don't know any of this.

10:12.731 --> 10:14.364
You've got to give it a chance, Alex.

10:14.399 --> 10:16.233
You've blown stuff off for fifteen years,

10:16.267 --> 10:18.000
it's not gonna just change in two minutes.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.738
Are you even listening to me?

10:23.739 --> 10:25.440
Yes, yes. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:25.475 --> 10:28.443
It's just, can't get
that song out of my head.

10:28.478 --> 10:32.480
<i>?T×³ Pine nuts, basil, dragon toes are h
ow you make a potion ?T×³</i>

10:32.515 --> 10:37.552
It's really annoying but... very catchy.

10:37.586 --> 10:41.089
See, it does work.
You can't get it out of your head.

10:41.123 --> 10:42.757
All right, Alex.

10:42.792 --> 10:45.693
The gloves are off when it comes to
the wizard competition. I'm taking it.

10:45.727 --> 10:49.295
Well, take it somewhere else
because I'm studying in here.

10:49.330 --> 10:51.496
What's the use? We're not gonna win.

10:53.031 --> 10:55.663
What we need to do is sabotage Justin.

10:56.598 --> 10:58.132
Sabotage, huh?

10:58.166 --> 11:00.133
What would Justin do?

11:03.969 --> 11:05.903
Sorry, Max. You're on your own.

11:07.639 --> 11:11.309
But if I was going to, which I'm not...

11:13.145 --> 11:15.246
- -
- ...I'd probably start by...

11:15.280 --> 11:16.947
Studying.

11:21.318 --> 11:22.751
I'm sorry, Max. I can't help you.

11:24.487 --> 11:27.488
Look at you, letting your
conscience be your guide.

11:27.523 --> 11:29.757
Well, what am I supposed to do?

11:29.791 --> 11:33.260
Well... Do what I just did.
I have a conscience,

11:33.294 --> 11:35.295
and I'm letting it be my guide.

11:36.230 --> 11:37.296
Whatever.

11:40.267 --> 11:44.670
Let my conscience be my guide?
What's that supposed to mean?

11:47.573 --> 11:49.006
Hmm.

11:51.810 --> 11:55.212
Guide, guide, tour guide.

11:56.581 --> 11:58.482
Ha! Here we go! Conscience guide.

11:58.516 --> 12:01.384
Read all instructions before reciting spell.

12:01.419 --> 12:03.519
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:03.554 --> 12:06.655
Boom! My inner thoughts
of right and wrong...

12:07.857 --> 12:09.624
...come out, come out where you belong.

12:15.664 --> 12:18.832
- Who the heck are you?
- I'm your conscience.

12:20.067 --> 12:23.569
Uh-oh. Maybe I didn't do that right.

12:28.125 --> 12:31.994
So, you're my conscience?

12:32.028 --> 12:35.163
This isn't what I meant to do.
You gotta get out of here.

12:35.198 --> 12:38.132
Well, I wouldn't even be here if you
would have read the instructions.

12:38.167 --> 12:41.400
Instructions are for cheaters.

12:42.935 --> 12:45.870
You were supposed to say this
spell in front of a mirror.

12:45.904 --> 12:48.405
Then your reflection would
become your conscience.

12:48.439 --> 12:49.940
And I wouldn't be out here.

12:49.974 --> 12:52.109
How come you don't look like me?

12:52.143 --> 12:54.211
I'm what you look like to other people.

12:56.047 --> 12:58.247
Oh, my gosh.

12:58.281 --> 13:02.217
I guess I have to admit it now.
I don't have a mustache.

13:03.553 --> 13:06.321
But I do like you. I'm gonna call you Roy.

13:07.957 --> 13:11.826
Don't call me Roy. I'm not Roy.
I'm your conscience.

13:11.860 --> 13:15.495
Listen, Roy, I need ideas on how
to sabotage my brother Justin

13:15.530 --> 13:17.564
so he doesn't win the wizard competition.

13:17.598 --> 13:21.367
Do you really think sabotaging
Justin is a good idea?

13:21.401 --> 13:23.602
I just said it was.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.337
If you want to be my servant,
you gotta do what I say.

13:26.371 --> 13:30.573
I'm not your servant. I'm your conscience.

13:30.607 --> 13:32.574
I help you decide right from wrong.

13:32.609 --> 13:35.610
I know what the difference is,
I just like to choose wrong.

13:37.278 --> 13:39.546
So, let's hear some sabotage ideas.

13:39.580 --> 13:43.682
Look, if you're gonna do
bad stuff to your brother,

13:43.716 --> 13:45.317
then you're no different...

13:46.652 --> 13:48.519
...than the monsters in this book.

13:48.554 --> 13:50.221
Hmm?

13:52.458 --> 13:54.425
That's what we should do.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.527
We bring all the monsters
in this manual to life.

13:56.561 --> 13:58.729
That way Justin will never
be able to capture them

13:58.763 --> 14:01.497
and he'll fail his independent study.

14:01.531 --> 14:05.366
But if you did that, the city
would be overrun with monsters.

14:05.401 --> 14:07.301
Agreed. Then that's what we'll do.

14:09.503 --> 14:13.205
I'm trying to tell you it'll be a
lot of trouble for a lot of people.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.074
Dude, I'm with you. We are doing it.

14:15.108 --> 14:17.175
It's just gonna cause problems.

14:17.210 --> 14:20.279
For Justin. It's perfect.

14:20.313 --> 14:24.016
OK, I give up.

14:24.050 --> 14:26.785
- Do whatever you want.
- OK.

14:29.422 --> 14:33.226
Hot monsters in the city,
run a-wild, what a pity.

14:45.101 --> 14:48.470
You just released the most
horrible monsters into New York.

14:48.505 --> 14:50.105
You happy?

14:50.139 --> 14:53.008
I think so. It feels pretty good.

14:55.344 --> 14:57.546
"Feels pretty good.
" Well, when they come back here

14:57.580 --> 14:59.949
and eat your face off,
I don't want to hear it.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.417
- They're not coming back here.
- They could.

15:02.452 --> 15:05.620
They're loose in the city.
That's what I was telling you.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.589
Roy, you have gotta be more clear next time.

15:10.191 --> 15:14.494
- This is totally your fault.
- Mine? You cast the spell.

15:14.528 --> 15:17.194
Look, when something bad happens,
you blame whoever you're with.

15:17.228 --> 15:19.061
That's how this family works.

15:19.096 --> 15:21.396
Well, you're kind of blaming yourself.

15:21.431 --> 15:24.032
OK, well, then let's go blame Alex.

15:25.634 --> 15:29.670
Look, if anyone asks, your name is Darren.

15:29.705 --> 15:32.373
I don't want them to know
who you really are. OK, Roy?

15:55.359 --> 15:58.027
-

16:03.833 --> 16:05.734
Excuse me, sir.

16:07.404 --> 16:09.871
Do you have the time?

16:09.905 --> 16:12.472
- Yeah, it's about...
- Caught ya, Fakeahorseus.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.842
Whoop-de-doo. You caught
a level one monster.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.943
- When's the parade?
- Come on.

16:21.079 --> 16:22.579
Let's go.

16:33.655 --> 16:34.922
Another monster?

16:36.358 --> 16:39.160
Well, looks like your stable's
about to get another...

16:40.330 --> 16:41.997
...roommate that's not so...

16:42.966 --> 16:44.032
...stable.

16:48.804 --> 16:50.338
Another monster?

16:50.372 --> 16:51.472
What's going on?

16:52.708 --> 16:57.410
Oh, my gosh. They're everywhere.

17:27.233 --> 17:28.268
Harper?

17:30.504 --> 17:32.104
Is everything OK?

17:32.139 --> 17:34.606
Oh, you mean 'cause it didn't rhyme?

17:34.641 --> 17:36.242
I'll work on that.

17:37.611 --> 17:40.913
Alex, you are in a load of trouble.

17:40.947 --> 17:43.682
I took your advice and let
my conscience be my guide.

17:43.716 --> 17:47.152
- That's good.
- Here's my conscience, Gordon.

17:47.186 --> 17:50.219
- He stinks as a guide.
- What are you talking about?

17:50.253 --> 17:52.087
Oh, he's talking about the monsters

17:52.121 --> 17:54.622
he released into the
city to sabotage Justin.

17:54.656 --> 17:58.359
Monsters all over the city?

17:58.393 --> 18:00.360
Well, I'll see you in P.E.!

18:05.665 --> 18:09.367
Max, I can't believe you would
do something this stupid.

18:09.401 --> 18:12.737
Alex, I think we all believe I
could do something this stupid.

18:14.506 --> 18:16.806
We gotta go save Justin.

18:16.841 --> 18:17.907
OK.

18:21.611 --> 18:23.545
Max, what is that?

18:23.579 --> 18:25.713
It's a volleyball net.
If we get a monster game

18:25.748 --> 18:27.581
of Red Rover going, we can capture them all.

18:27.615 --> 18:30.550
And if they're nice,
we can play some volleyball.

18:30.584 --> 18:32.451
Get rid of it and let's go.

18:34.120 --> 18:37.355
I'm serious, my monster detector
is lit up like a Christmas tree.

18:37.390 --> 18:39.390
It's as if I'm surrounded by monsters,

18:39.424 --> 18:40.457
but I don't see any.

18:40.491 --> 18:42.692
-

18:43.728 --> 18:45.495
-

18:46.797 --> 18:48.330
OK, so I see them.

18:48.365 --> 18:50.398
Quick question. -

18:50.433 --> 18:52.366
What are they all doing here?!

18:55.437 --> 18:58.071
I told you guys not to bring that.

18:58.106 --> 19:00.107
Justin! -

19:00.141 --> 19:01.508
We need a distraction

19:01.542 --> 19:03.343
so we can get Justin out of there.

19:03.377 --> 19:05.310
- OK, you want us to break dance?
- Oh, yeah.

19:19.059 --> 19:20.626
Would you knock it off!

19:22.595 --> 19:25.930
Alex, quick, use a spell!

19:25.965 --> 19:27.632
What do I do?

19:27.666 --> 19:29.300
- Ready?
- Here we go.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.235
- Whoa, bring it back.
- Whoa!

19:32.770 --> 19:34.237
I'm a little busy right now.

19:39.507 --> 19:43.010
Hold on. Hold on. I can do this.

19:43.045 --> 19:45.180
<i>?T×³ When I need something that's far away
?T×³</i>

19:45.214 --> 19:47.148
<i>?T×³ Sprout some legs and go where I say
?T×³</i>

19:47.183 --> 19:48.983
Leg-and-feet-a-run-a-meet-a.

19:59.559 --> 20:01.126
Train in vain, go to Spain.

20:12.837 --> 20:13.870
You did it!

20:17.140 --> 20:18.574
Thank you. You saved me.

20:18.608 --> 20:21.609
- We all did.
- No, we didn't.

20:21.644 --> 20:24.879
- Why are you saying that?
- Why are you still here?

20:26.749 --> 20:31.086
- Who the heck is that guy?
- That is Max's conscience.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.221
Max was messing around with magic

20:33.255 --> 20:36.657
and brought his conscience and
all of those monsters to life.

20:36.691 --> 20:40.260
They totally interrupted my studying,
and I had to come down here and fix it.

20:40.294 --> 20:43.929
Oh, my gosh. Listen to me,
I'm turning into you.

20:43.964 --> 20:46.064
And you can't stand it, can you?

20:46.099 --> 20:48.199
No, actually, I'm OK with it.

20:48.234 --> 20:49.700
- You want to know why?
- Why?

20:49.735 --> 20:51.935
Because I'm this much
closer to catching up to you

20:51.970 --> 20:55.238
- in the wizard competition.
- Great.

20:55.272 --> 20:57.273
I accept that challenge.

21:01.311 --> 21:02.611
Max, what are you doing?

21:02.645 --> 21:05.714
I'm wrestling with my conscience.

21:13.177 --> 21:15.885
Moises, we just wanted
to say how happy we are

21:15.919 --> 21:18.528
to have you on the show and we were
wondering if we could get a picture.

21:18.563 --> 21:20.312
- Oh, sure. Of course.
- Oh, great, here's the camera.

21:27.325 --> 21:30.968
Wait, you want me to
take the picture of you?

21:31.002 --> 21:33.745
Sure, we do this with all our guest stars.
Check out the photo album.

21:36.589 --> 21:39.030
But, this is just the same exact picture.

21:39.064 --> 21:40.556
Uh-huh, I know. Yeah.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.366
No, see this one was taken by Jeff Garlin.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.176
And this one was taken by Misty May-Treanor.

21:47.995 --> 21:53.122
And then, this one is
taken by Dwayne Johnson.

21:53.156 --> 21:55.273
Really? You sure about that?

21:55.308 --> 21:57.425
Yeah, you can see his finger
in the shot a little bit.

21:57.459 --> 21:59.409
- And it's huge. So...
- Yes.

22:00.827 --> 22:02.753
All right, come on, picture! Let's go!

22:07.048 --> 22:08.206
Smile.

22:09.757 --> 22:12.041
- Yay! Thanks. 'Kay, bye.
- Thanks. OK, bye.

22:16.010 --> 22:19.520
Hey, Moisies, would you like
to play with some props, maybe?
