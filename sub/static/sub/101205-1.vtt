01:55.897 --> 01:59.688
Will you kill me
As you're leaving?

02:02.813 --> 02:07.688
Erase my name, erase my face.

02:10.479 --> 02:15.772
Take your sins and dreams
Somewhere else.

02:17.647 --> 02:22.730
And bury our love
In a secret place.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.480
Will you burn down your life.

02:32.355 --> 02:36.438
To start all over again?

02:39.772 --> 02:44.355
Throw away my favorite dress.

02:47.022 --> 02:51.897
The one that's hidden
In your suitcase.

02:54.897 --> 02:59.272
You turn red wine
Into sweet blood.

03:02.438 --> 03:06.563
You put me under your spell.

03:09.688 --> 03:14.313
Under the moonlight
Life was so intoxicating.

03:16.938 --> 03:20.855
This is the death of a love
To foretell.

03:24.063 --> 03:28.438
You watched our love
Shyly, slowly.

03:54.188 --> 03:58.397
You turn red wine
Into sweet blood.

05:40.688 --> 05:43.313
Whoo!

08:42.397 --> 08:43.813
Ah!

11:05.938 --> 11:07.397
Hey!

11:20.147 --> 11:21.147
Ah!

11:45.772 --> 11:47.272
What are you doing?

15:12.230 --> 15:14.063
Are you all right, sir?

17:08.230 --> 17:11.938
Welcome to another edition
of Navajo Nation News.

17:12.521 --> 17:16.080
Today we will be talking
with Chief Tall Bitter Water

17:16.105 --> 17:19.539
about uranium crisis
regarding our people.

17:19.563 --> 17:22.205
Also in studio, joining us,

17:22.230 --> 17:25.248
Chief Engineer from
Wes Tauros Engineering Company,

17:25.271 --> 17:28.271
in charge of mineral
extraction, Mr. John Previs.

17:28.688 --> 17:29.688
Chief?

17:29.980 --> 17:31.688
We call this yellow dirt,

17:32.272 --> 17:33.480
leetso.

17:34.147 --> 17:36.105
It's a monstrous layer

17:37.480 --> 17:42.164
that poisons men's lungs
and women's wombs.

17:42.188 --> 17:43.581
It's only harvest

17:43.605 --> 17:45.956
of a thousand
abandoned uranium mines.

17:45.980 --> 17:50.313
Uh, your concerns, uh, Chief,
are in the past.

17:50.563 --> 17:56.164
Uh, there are no tunnels
involved now in our process.

17:56.188 --> 17:59.123
This is a completely safe
and effective process

17:59.147 --> 18:03.206
and I can assure you
that it risks no ones' life.

18:03.230 --> 18:08.438
Anything that man makes
is not completely safe.

18:08.772 --> 18:09.897
Anything

18:10.480 --> 18:15.480
Navajo men are dying
of radiation-related diseases.

18:16.230 --> 18:19.873
Many sick ones are denied
compensation.

18:19.897 --> 18:23.789
The United States
Department of Justice

18:23.813 --> 18:25.914
delays and quibbles

18:25.938 --> 18:29.998
while the widows are married
to their dead men.

18:30.022 --> 18:31.206
I can't speak

18:31.230 --> 18:33.623
for the United States
Department of Justice,

18:33.647 --> 18:35.831
I can only speak
for our company.

18:35.855 --> 18:37.813
Uh, and in speaking so,

18:37.855 --> 18:40.081
I can tell you
that there is no statistic

18:40.105 --> 18:42.956
or scientific evidence
to support your position.

18:42.980 --> 18:45.623
All you're doing
with this protest

18:45.647 --> 18:50.897
is blocking your people
from their ability to prosper.

18:51.355 --> 18:53.022
Without our company,

18:53.980 --> 18:55.373
where else
is your economic growth

18:55.397 --> 18:56.498
going to come from?

18:56.522 --> 19:01.414
You... Your company
will be making money from...

19:01.438 --> 19:04.039
And so will you,
and that's the whole point.

19:04.063 --> 19:04.915
But that's not,

19:04.939 --> 19:06.623
that's not the point
I'm trying to make.

19:06.647 --> 19:09.581
The point I'm trying to make
is that we've lived here

19:09.605 --> 19:11.081
for many years.

19:11.105 --> 19:13.956
How have you lived?
How? And how do you live?

19:13.980 --> 19:15.081
That's the question.

19:15.105 --> 19:16.373
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And that is the way

19:16.397 --> 19:18.373
- that we know how to live.
- Hey, get it?

19:18.397 --> 19:20.123
Joining us via live - Shut up.

19:20.147 --> 19:21.373
Is John Kazubowski.

19:21.397 --> 19:23.331
- Shut the fuck up!
- John, you've heard

19:23.355 --> 19:25.688
what's happening here
in the studio.

19:26.105 --> 19:27.164
What are your comments?

19:27.188 --> 19:30.164
What I could gather here
from BLM people,

19:30.188 --> 19:34.438
the sale of Valley of The Gods
to Wes Tauros is completed.

19:34.938 --> 19:37.164
And Tauros Engineering
has a green light

19:37.188 --> 19:39.022
to move their equipment in.

19:39.522 --> 19:43.063
Wes Tauros
will not get our land.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.623
Our gods will never allow it.

19:46.647 --> 19:48.355
Bring us the dough, man.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.664
Bird Face must know.

19:50.688 --> 19:52.355
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:52.772 --> 19:56.313
The Valley of The Gods
is the foot of our mountains.

19:59.313 --> 20:01.081
What are we gonna do

20:01.105 --> 20:03.831
if we turn the Valley
over to them?

20:03.855 --> 20:05.772
Hey! Oh.

20:06.272 --> 20:10.772
If somebody takes everything out
from your legs,

20:11.147 --> 20:13.147
how can you stand up?

20:16.438 --> 20:18.313
Grandpa,
these are just fairytales.

20:19.022 --> 20:20.688
Shut the fuck up!

20:29.730 --> 20:30.772
Hey!

21:29.438 --> 21:31.230
- What are you doing?
- You're so beautiful.

21:43.438 --> 21:44.605
Sweetgrass.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.105
And you can't even give me
my son.

22:25.772 --> 22:26.772
Hi.

22:28.272 --> 22:32.539
It's been a long time.

22:32.563 --> 22:33.956
You're just as lovely.

22:33.980 --> 22:35.164
Can I get something to drink?

22:35.188 --> 22:40.730
As you used to be.

22:41.647 --> 22:43.480
How's your new life?

22:50.230 --> 22:51.480
How much is it?

22:52.730 --> 22:57.647
Means so much to me.

22:59.438 --> 23:01.147
What's that, darlin'?

23:01.647 --> 23:03.313
How am I doin'?

23:03.897 --> 23:07.456
I'm doin' all right.

23:07.480 --> 23:10.123
Except I can't sleep.

23:10.147 --> 23:16.022
And I cry all night Till dawn.

23:16.605 --> 23:19.147
What I'm trying...

23:27.855 --> 23:29.022
You...

23:38.522 --> 23:41.772
You want to fuck us good, huh?

23:52.022 --> 23:58.522
And if you should ever
Find it in your heart.

23:58.730 --> 24:01.105
To forgive me.

24:01.563 --> 24:03.831
<i>Come back, damn'</i>

24:03.855 --> 24:10.022
I'll be waiting for you.

25:41.105 --> 25:41.832
You'll be okay.

25:41.856 --> 25:44.022
Grab me on both sides
and we step back.

25:45.897 --> 25:46.938
Whoo!

25:48.063 --> 25:50.438
Whoo!

25:55.355 --> 25:57.188
Whoo!

26:48.230 --> 26:50.373
You, you fantasize
about your life

26:50.397 --> 26:53.313
and in the meantime,
we don't even have a child.

26:56.272 --> 26:58.230
Every week,
it's the same thing with you.

26:59.063 --> 27:01.748
I, I, I need to concentrate.

27:01.772 --> 27:05.647
I'm a writer. I am an artist.

27:09.063 --> 27:11.914
You don't even use a cellphone,
you don't use a computer.

27:11.938 --> 27:12.938
You...

27:13.063 --> 27:17.063
You live in a fantasy world
and I live in the real one.

27:21.022 --> 27:23.772
And last week, I really,
I really felt...

27:26.438 --> 27:27.813
I felt free.

27:29.897 --> 27:31.248
Like I could see myself

27:31.272 --> 27:34.272
in the world
from a different perspective.

27:38.230 --> 27:39.897
I could fly.

27:40.813 --> 27:41.897
Ah.

27:45.688 --> 27:47.605
It was a dream birthday gift.

27:54.522 --> 27:56.438
Yes, I know. Uh...

27:58.397 --> 27:59.813
And thank you for that.

29:06.563 --> 29:07.605
Who is that?

29:09.980 --> 29:11.022
Hi.

29:11.938 --> 29:13.730
- Can you help me?
- Ah.

29:15.272 --> 29:16.313
Stop.

29:16.397 --> 29:17.623
I see, okay fine.

29:17.647 --> 29:19.438
Well, then,
maybe don't come back.

29:19.647 --> 29:20.897
All right?

29:21.980 --> 29:23.147
That's all.

29:23.230 --> 29:24.647
Bye, John.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.081
We should emphasize that

29:34.105 --> 29:35.914
Tauros Engineering's
technologies

29:35.938 --> 29:38.230
supplies carbon-free power.

29:38.813 --> 29:42.539
Over the last century,
we have been enslaved by oil

29:42.563 --> 29:44.563
and other fossil fuels.

29:49.605 --> 29:54.897
In our campaign, we have
to stress that oil is the past.

29:55.230 --> 29:57.813
Uranium is the future.

29:58.438 --> 30:02.914
The buzzwords to stick to are
"safe and reliable energy"

30:02.938 --> 30:05.623
as well as
"promoting jobs and security

30:05.647 --> 30:07.563
in a struggling
Navajo community."

30:08.313 --> 30:10.456
Excuse me, John.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.581
This is your job.
You were supposed to do it.

30:12.605 --> 30:13.980
You're the copywriter.

31:00.313 --> 31:03.331
Do you think there could be

31:03.355 --> 31:05.522
a positive side to this?

31:06.397 --> 31:07.397
Hm?

31:08.188 --> 31:11.081
You're now free
to do all the things

31:11.105 --> 31:12.831
that you ever wanted to do.

31:12.855 --> 31:14.605
Perhaps you could
write that novel.

31:16.188 --> 31:18.081
You remember that
wonderful story you told me

31:18.105 --> 31:21.605
about the richest man
on the planet?

31:22.022 --> 31:26.272
And those crazy Navajo legends.

31:26.772 --> 31:28.022
You remember that?

31:28.355 --> 31:30.164
But I can't do anything
right now.

31:30.188 --> 31:31.688
Don't you understand?

31:32.313 --> 31:33.438
Anything

31:37.813 --> 31:39.897
Well, you must do something.

31:41.188 --> 31:42.956
Go back to your paying job

31:42.980 --> 31:45.897
or take a cruise
around the Caribbean?

31:46.813 --> 31:49.998
You must find something
to occupy your mind.

31:50.022 --> 31:53.373
Maybe do a PhD
in baseball statistics.

31:53.397 --> 31:55.331
Whatever it takes.

31:55.355 --> 31:58.998
But you must not sit at home
and do nothing.

31:59.022 --> 32:00.105
Why not?

32:00.980 --> 32:02.438
It feels good,

32:03.063 --> 32:04.248
waiting for the final quake

32:04.272 --> 32:06.522
to wipe this
goddamned place out.

32:08.730 --> 32:14.105
You must overcome this fear
of being outside.

32:15.438 --> 32:19.647
Walk through your fears
to conquer fear.

32:20.022 --> 32:23.397
That's what the, uh,
the mystics say.

32:24.063 --> 32:26.414
Try doing something
that you're afraid of doing

32:26.438 --> 32:28.081
and then

32:28.105 --> 32:29.998
you will lose your fear of it.

32:30.022 --> 32:31.373
Bullshit.

32:31.397 --> 32:32.998
I'm afraid to jump
from the tenth floor,

32:33.022 --> 32:35.647
so I'm supposed to jump
to beat that fear?

32:37.272 --> 32:39.581
Do not exaggerate
what I'm saying

32:39.605 --> 32:40.873
to an absurd proportion.

32:40.897 --> 32:42.772
But everything's absurd.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.688
This city,

32:47.355 --> 32:49.831
politics, entertainment,
sports...

32:49.855 --> 32:52.331
Have you noticed the black sun
that's shining over LA?

32:52.355 --> 32:56.789
It's not white, yellow, or gold,
it's blindingly black.

32:56.813 --> 32:58.147
And you know why?

32:58.355 --> 33:01.123
Because it shines over
the land of the dead,

33:01.147 --> 33:03.938
who roam it entombed
in their cars.

33:11.980 --> 33:13.688
And when they get
a moment to themselves,

33:13.813 --> 33:14.998
they line up to watch a movie

33:15.022 --> 33:17.813
with a guy flying about
in the air.

33:18.647 --> 33:21.248
Every Bond or Cruise in it jumps
from the tenth floor

33:21.272 --> 33:23.730
every couple of minutes
and somehow lands safely.

33:23.980 --> 33:26.355
Doesn't even bust his tendon.

33:27.105 --> 33:28.914
And people buy that.

33:28.938 --> 33:30.914
John, let me ask you a question.

33:30.938 --> 33:35.105
Why is it that you cannot live
with the absurdity of this?

33:36.022 --> 33:37.688
Like the rest of mankind.

33:39.063 --> 33:42.748
Or is it that you want
to conduct a war

33:42.772 --> 33:44.647
against the absurd?

33:45.772 --> 33:48.855
In which case, try to outdo it.

33:49.355 --> 33:54.998
If you want to destroy
the sense of absurdity,

33:55.022 --> 33:57.123
use the absurd.

33:57.147 --> 33:58.230
Meaning?

33:59.897 --> 34:00.897
Well

34:02.605 --> 34:05.022
do something
that makes no sense to you.

34:05.647 --> 34:08.748
Take all your pots and pans
for a hike.

34:08.772 --> 34:09.998
Walk backwards,

34:10.022 --> 34:12.539
go out into the deserts
and talk to the rocks.

34:12.563 --> 34:15.897
Do whatever you need to do,
but...

34:16.897 --> 34:17.897
John,

34:19.563 --> 34:20.563
do it.

34:30.313 --> 34:33.706
In your world of admirers
Lovers, and hangers on.

34:33.730 --> 34:37.813
Bathroom mirrors, ghosts
And fleeting friends.

34:39.730 --> 34:43.373
Your SOSs Your emotional messes.

34:43.397 --> 34:47.397
And your dramas without end.

34:49.188 --> 34:52.914
Your victories, wardrobe full
of clothes you never wear.

34:52.938 --> 34:57.605
A vase of daffodils
in your window.

34:58.938 --> 35:03.248
It's here I met graveyard
Of my dreams.

35:03.272 --> 35:06.772
The ones I didn't wanna know.

35:08.647 --> 35:14.355
Buried in the darkness
Sitting naked in your chair.

38:04.855 --> 38:06.022
Ah!

38:10.313 --> 38:11.563
Oh.

38:48.230 --> 38:50.813
So what's life like
just sitting here?

38:54.647 --> 38:56.438
I've seen you here before.

38:56.688 --> 38:58.397
Is this your favorite spot?

38:58.813 --> 39:00.522
This is the worst spot.

39:01.813 --> 39:03.022
The worst spot?

39:03.438 --> 39:04.438
Why?

39:14.063 --> 39:15.772
I lost my women there.

39:37.647 --> 39:39.063
This is everything I got.

39:40.897 --> 39:41.980
Get some food.

40:15.730 --> 40:16.855
Thank you.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.022
My baby.

43:51.147 --> 43:54.480
My baby... will get you all.

47:24.313 --> 47:26.022
Don't be afraid.

47:27.355 --> 47:29.022
Come closer.

47:33.772 --> 47:35.397
Lower your head.

47:36.897 --> 47:38.980
We need to scan your eye.

47:50.272 --> 47:52.647
We know everything about you.

48:11.272 --> 48:12.748
believe that the future

48:12.772 --> 48:14.230
belongs to young people,

48:14.563 --> 48:18.313
and the imagination
to create a better world.

48:27.272 --> 48:28.480
Whoo!

48:53.438 --> 48:54.605
Don't worry, sir.

48:55.438 --> 48:56.855
They won't harm you.

48:59.230 --> 49:01.039
Mr. Tauros is very pleased

49:01.063 --> 49:04.063
that you have honored him
with your presence, sir.

49:04.480 --> 49:06.897
I hope that sir
shall like it here.

49:07.397 --> 49:10.206
We have a modest room
reserved for sir,

49:10.230 --> 49:12.938
sheets of paper
arranged the way sir likes them,

49:13.313 --> 49:14.831
and a fountain pen.

49:14.855 --> 49:18.498
We know how sir hates
writing on computers.

49:18.522 --> 49:20.313
How do you know so much
about me?

49:20.730 --> 49:24.373
Oh, before we admit anyone
into Mr. Tauros's residence,

49:24.397 --> 49:26.980
we take
every possible precaution.

49:27.730 --> 49:28.748
I'm sure you are aware

49:28.772 --> 49:31.855
of how many pitfalls await
the world's richest man.

49:32.230 --> 49:36.022
And Mr. Tauros does not like
armies of security guards.

49:36.688 --> 49:41.188
That would drive him to suicide
like his idol, Elvis.

49:41.397 --> 49:42.980
Can you imagine that, sir?

49:43.230 --> 49:48.647
Poor Elvis sitting day and night
in Graceland with his henchmen,

49:49.063 --> 49:50.563
and what was there to do?

49:50.730 --> 49:53.438
He just ate, got fat,

49:53.980 --> 49:57.331
and wasted his voice
on mundane conversations

49:57.355 --> 50:00.980
about the narrow horizons
of his protectors...

50:03.647 --> 50:05.938
Mr. Tauros loves art

50:06.063 --> 50:08.414
and had statues
made of all the people

50:08.438 --> 50:10.438
who were or are dear to him.

50:11.188 --> 50:12.313
If he likes you, sir,

50:12.688 --> 50:16.772
perhaps your likeness
shall find a place here.

50:20.480 --> 50:22.605
Who's that
singing so beautifully?

50:23.105 --> 50:25.772
Ah, that is Madame Norman.

50:26.480 --> 50:29.730
She's preparing a concert
for Mr. Tauros.

50:34.480 --> 50:38.355
And that, sir, is Madame Sara.

50:39.188 --> 50:41.855
Mr. Tauros's beloved wife.

50:44.980 --> 50:48.563
She is with Leelee,
Mr. Tauros's daughter.

50:49.355 --> 50:53.230
Sadly, they both died
in a car accident.

51:08.022 --> 51:10.022
This is your room, sir.

51:10.480 --> 51:12.022
I do hope you like it.

51:14.938 --> 51:18.938
And here are some loose leaves,
as you like them.

51:20.522 --> 51:22.313
And a fountain pen.

51:22.980 --> 51:25.688
Mont Blanc, like yours.

51:26.897 --> 51:28.730
Yes, pen is good.

51:29.272 --> 51:30.522
Has blood.

51:31.438 --> 51:32.897
Blue blood.

51:33.813 --> 51:36.438
Is there anything else
you would like, sir?

51:37.480 --> 51:38.563
No.

51:39.605 --> 51:41.188
Should hit the sack.

51:42.147 --> 51:44.938
In that case, sir,
I shall turn up your bed.

52:17.105 --> 52:18.563
Good night, sir.

52:18.980 --> 52:19.980
Good night.

52:54.855 --> 52:56.938
Laura!

57:00.397 --> 57:01.647
No!

57:13.397 --> 57:14.480
No!

01:02:57.022 --> 01:02:58.855
Ooh...

01:03:14.355 --> 01:03:18.414
The first man brought soil
from the hole in the sky,

01:03:18.438 --> 01:03:20.605
and he planted our mountains.

01:03:25.563 --> 01:03:29.688
And he covered them
with a sheet of daylight.

01:03:30.563 --> 01:03:34.772
And he covered them
with some Grey clouds.

01:04:11.938 --> 01:04:14.480
And all the mountains,

01:04:14.563 --> 01:04:18.272
he nailed down with
the sharpest of the rainbow.

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:23.772
For when the mountains walk,
earth trembles.

01:04:36.813 --> 01:04:38.647
Give me back my son.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.272
Take him.

01:04:40.688 --> 01:04:42.188
See if you can.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.397
It's based on the
♪. Paul (Betty's release form.

01:10:14.355 --> 01:10:15.855
Sign here, please.

01:10:16.522 --> 01:10:18.730
You must be feeling very lucky.

01:10:20.188 --> 01:10:21.331
Why?

01:10:21.355 --> 01:10:25.289
After all, you've been selected
from among <i>273</i> applicants.

01:10:25.313 --> 01:10:26.748
You have very similar features.

01:10:26.772 --> 01:10:29.498
The same neckline,
breasts, hands.

01:10:29.522 --> 01:10:30.938
Sign here, please.

01:10:32.063 --> 01:10:34.105
I'm doing it just for my son.

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:36.730
- How old is he?
- Eight.

01:10:37.688 --> 01:10:39.397
I have to get him back.

01:10:39.563 --> 01:10:42.397
You will, you will.

01:10:56.522 --> 01:10:58.397
What kind of stone is this?

01:11:02.147 --> 01:11:03.855
That's the stone of my son.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.813
Of your son?

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:07.397
Yes.

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:09.730
From his kidney.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.105
She's ready, sir.

01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:52.522
What's this?

01:11:55.147 --> 01:11:56.772
A museum.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.313
A museum of poverty.

01:12:00.105 --> 01:12:02.873
In his teens,
Mr. Tauros wandered aimlessly

01:12:02.897 --> 01:12:04.522
across the country.

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.456
He was so hungry, he ate reeds.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:08.605
Yes.

01:12:08.938 --> 01:12:10.813
He got to Las Vegas,

01:12:11.688 --> 01:12:13.147
lived in a hovel.

01:12:14.272 --> 01:12:15.831
Somewhere on the Strip,

01:12:15.855 --> 01:12:18.897
he found a paper bag
full of dollar bills.

01:12:20.063 --> 01:12:21.813
I guess he had luck with it.

01:12:22.397 --> 01:12:23.980
Wes Tauros?

01:12:25.855 --> 01:12:28.272
Wes Tauros indeed.

01:12:29.105 --> 01:12:31.331
These pieces of junk
are more precious to him

01:12:31.355 --> 01:12:34.105
than the finest Venetian china.

01:12:49.022 --> 01:12:50.813
The famous...

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.855
Wes Tauros.

01:12:57.605 --> 01:12:59.230
What would you like me to do?

01:12:59.355 --> 01:13:02.897
Madame,
you should lay face down.

01:13:06.688 --> 01:13:07.855
You're staying?

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.230
Yes, Madame.

01:13:11.355 --> 01:13:12.855
For a threesome?

01:13:14.397 --> 01:13:17.730
Please, Madame, don't be vulgar.

01:13:19.397 --> 01:13:21.147
Lie face down.

01:14:08.522 --> 01:14:09.897
What would she do?

01:16:36.647 --> 01:16:37.831
Fucking hey, man!

01:16:37.855 --> 01:16:38.582
What are you doing?

01:16:38.606 --> 01:16:40.039
You're violating our holy place!

01:16:40.063 --> 01:16:41.081
Do you know what this is?

01:16:41.105 --> 01:16:42.873
This is our fathers'
holy resting place.

01:16:42.897 --> 01:16:44.313
And you just woke them up.

01:16:44.355 --> 01:16:45.373
Do you know what that means?

01:16:45.397 --> 01:16:47.813
- Hey, Grey Horse, come on.
- Huh?

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:50.313
Grey Horse.

01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:51.688
"Our fathers"?

01:16:52.438 --> 01:16:55.105
Since when did you care
about this stuff, huh, man?

01:16:55.897 --> 01:16:59.313
In a few days, this won't be
a resting place anymore.

01:16:59.605 --> 01:17:00.290
Get it?

01:17:00.314 --> 01:17:01.563
Fuck you, Bird Face.

01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:03.414
- Yeah, fuck you too.
- Who are you?

01:17:03.438 --> 01:17:05.105
Reservation Police.

01:17:06.938 --> 01:17:08.147
Are you okay?

01:17:09.147 --> 01:17:10.313
Never been better.

01:17:11.688 --> 01:17:12.956
Show me your driving license.

01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:15.188
Well, it's... It's burned.

01:17:16.355 --> 01:17:18.022
Maybe, I don't know.

01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:29.897
God! Goddamn it, fuck!

01:17:37.688 --> 01:17:39.063
You're under arrest then.

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:40.813
Frisk him.

01:17:42.855 --> 01:17:44.105
Get up.

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:58.456
Let's see what we got here.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.105
Credit cards.

01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:02.480
Four hundred bucks.

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.522
A lot.

01:18:05.438 --> 01:18:06.688
Keep the cash,

01:18:07.313 --> 01:18:08.563
keep the car.

01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:12.272
Keep whatever you want,
just leave me alone, please.

01:18:13.438 --> 01:18:15.730
Are you trying to bribe
the law enforcement officers?

01:18:16.313 --> 01:18:17.605
Hey, book him.

01:18:19.272 --> 01:18:22.272
Feel like he just stunk up
the whole freaking valley.

01:18:24.605 --> 01:18:26.063
Fucking great.

01:18:29.147 --> 01:18:32.188
Got Laura Ecas, attorney at law.

01:18:33.397 --> 01:18:34.438
Is she your lawyer?

01:18:34.522 --> 01:18:35.813
'Cause you're gonna need one.

01:18:38.897 --> 01:18:40.272
She's my wife.

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:12.980
Tauros loves to hear singing.

01:22:13.397 --> 01:22:15.313
He's been silent all his life.

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:16.397
No.

01:22:16.522 --> 01:22:19.938
I heard it was
since his wife and kid's death.

01:23:00.022 --> 01:23:02.063
When will Tauros finally arrive?

01:23:02.563 --> 01:23:05.289
You never know if he's going
to show up to anything.

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:09.188
He's buying Navajo Country
for their uranium ore.

01:23:33.105 --> 01:23:35.855
He may no longer be
the world's richest man.

01:23:36.147 --> 01:23:38.522
Sound like he's been overtaken,
I've heard.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.063
You're supposed to be dead.

01:24:32.397 --> 01:24:34.438
I saw your sculpture
in the garden.

01:24:35.647 --> 01:24:36.688
Really?

01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:39.498
Apparently, you died
in a car accident,

01:24:39.522 --> 01:24:40.831
along with your daughter.

01:24:40.855 --> 01:24:43.331
I don't have a daughter,
just a son.

01:24:43.355 --> 01:24:44.647
And he's fine.

01:24:45.897 --> 01:24:47.664
A few people have
already mistaken me

01:24:47.688 --> 01:24:49.272
for Tauros's wife.

01:24:53.813 --> 01:24:55.813
But you look exactly like her.

01:24:56.605 --> 01:25:00.081
Madame, I'd like to invite you
to the garden

01:25:00.105 --> 01:25:01.914
for the catapult display.

01:25:01.938 --> 01:25:04.414
You were supposed
to introduce me to Mr. Tauros.

01:25:04.438 --> 01:25:06.313
That is why I'm here, sir.

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.855
May I offer you my arm, Madame?

01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:11.914
Thank you, I'll stay here.

01:25:11.938 --> 01:25:13.980
But I insist, Madame.

01:25:14.563 --> 01:25:15.706
I'm not in the mood.

01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:20.355
Madame, do you know
what mood spelled backward is?

01:26:09.063 --> 01:26:14.313
And now if you will excuse me,
we have a surprise for you.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.980
Honored guests,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:26:38.813 --> 01:26:42.414
Mr. Tauros welcomes you all
most cordially

01:26:42.438 --> 01:26:46.063
and is delighted
that so many of you have come.

01:26:47.772 --> 01:26:49.938
For the requirements
of this evening,

01:26:50.397 --> 01:26:55.581
a team of engineers
led by Mr. Tauros himself

01:26:55.605 --> 01:26:56.980
have built a catapult.

01:26:57.063 --> 01:26:58.147
What are you doing here?

01:26:58.397 --> 01:26:59.831
in 500 years of...

01:26:59.855 --> 01:27:01.706
Same as you. I was invited.

01:27:01.730 --> 01:27:04.373
of Leonardo da Vinci.

01:27:04.397 --> 01:27:07.605
Maybe Mr. Tauros wanted to meet
someone who writes about him.

01:27:08.272 --> 01:27:09.272
Mm.

01:27:10.188 --> 01:27:12.022
And you need some spice?

01:27:13.105 --> 01:27:15.605
In a moment, we shall see
whether it works

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:20.831
as we attempt to fire from it
a certain superfluous item

01:27:20.855 --> 01:27:23.730
from the famed
Tauros collection.

01:27:51.063 --> 01:27:53.522
This is the Phantom V,

01:27:53.855 --> 01:27:57.831
in which Queen Elizabeth rode
during her royal visit

01:27:57.855 --> 01:27:59.313
to Bermuda.

01:28:10.897 --> 01:28:15.147
And here is our host himself,
Mr. Wes Tauros.

01:28:32.772 --> 01:28:33.855
I'm scared.

01:28:35.063 --> 01:28:37.272
Don't be. This catapult's solid.

01:28:39.022 --> 01:28:43.022
It's not the catapult, stupid.
It's this Bluebeard's castle.

01:28:44.313 --> 01:28:47.748
He locks his guests in cages
and turns them into stone.

01:28:47.772 --> 01:28:48.938
Let's go.

01:28:50.272 --> 01:28:51.897
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:28:53.022 --> 01:28:54.164
My wife will be here soon.

01:28:54.188 --> 01:28:56.938
You won't get out of here
on your own either.

01:29:00.147 --> 01:29:01.355
Idiot.

01:30:54.230 --> 01:30:55.480
Who's there?

01:31:17.147 --> 01:31:18.272
Laura.

01:31:24.563 --> 01:31:25.897
What are you doing here?

01:31:27.938 --> 01:31:30.063
Because you're still my husband.

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.438
I don't want you
doing anything stupid.

01:31:36.147 --> 01:31:37.730
Did you bring your desk
out here?

01:31:38.730 --> 01:31:39.938
Our desk.

01:31:43.355 --> 01:31:44.623
John, stop.

01:31:44.647 --> 01:31:46.206
- I love you so much.
- No, stop.

01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:47.438
I miss you.

01:31:48.397 --> 01:31:49.772
I missed you.

01:31:50.563 --> 01:31:51.730
No...

01:32:59.688 --> 01:33:03.147
The rock grew as tall as a tower

01:33:03.313 --> 01:33:06.022
and it reached
the temples of the gods.

01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:09.605
Dusk covered the windows.

01:33:09.897 --> 01:33:12.230
Darkness covered the houses.

01:33:13.105 --> 01:33:18.480
And the gods lacked breath,
as did the sheep in the fold.

01:33:19.272 --> 01:33:21.897
The sleeping rock has taken

01:33:22.397 --> 01:33:25.897
all the rain clouds
and put them in his head.

01:33:26.605 --> 01:33:29.605
For when the black storm comes,

01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:35.147
the sleeping rock will awaken
to avenge his people.

01:33:48.438 --> 01:33:53.914
Here in the center,
your spirit lives.

01:33:53.938 --> 01:33:58.605
The green spots
are sacred mountains.

01:33:59.272 --> 01:34:04.105
The yellow,
cities that eat our land.

01:34:05.313 --> 01:34:06.688
Do you hear?

01:34:07.563 --> 01:34:12.188
It's the wind
that gives us life.

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:16.706
The very wind
that comes out of our mouths

01:34:16.730 --> 01:34:20.480
when we breathe and speak.

01:34:21.230 --> 01:34:25.563
When it ceases
to blow inside us,

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:29.664
it can make us speechless,

01:34:29.688 --> 01:34:31.605
so that we die.

01:34:33.522 --> 01:34:39.980
All the stones hold the breaths
of those who lie underneath.

01:36:44.897 --> 01:36:46.563
No!

01:40:05.438 --> 01:40:07.063
What did you tell them?

01:40:07.563 --> 01:40:08.647
Huh?

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:13.522
How am I gonna see my child now?

01:40:16.563 --> 01:40:17.980
It's your fault.

01:40:19.313 --> 01:40:20.414
My fault?

01:40:20.438 --> 01:40:23.480
They accused me
of telling you the details.

01:40:25.063 --> 01:40:26.522
Details of what?

01:41:01.272 --> 01:41:03.688
How am I meant to communicate
with him if he's mute?

01:41:04.855 --> 01:41:07.855
There are many ways
of communicating, sir.

01:41:08.313 --> 01:41:10.897
As a writer,
you should know that well.

01:41:59.730 --> 01:42:02.522
I'm sure you've heard
of the Taj Mahal.

01:42:03.855 --> 01:42:06.272
On the other side of the river

01:42:06.897 --> 01:42:11.355
was to stand a twin Taj Mahal,
but a black one.

01:42:11.772 --> 01:42:14.748
That didn't happen
350 years ago,

01:42:14.772 --> 01:42:17.272
so now maybe I'll put it there.

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:23.563
I'm awaiting permission
from the Indian government.

01:42:24.855 --> 01:42:26.313
You speak.

01:42:26.855 --> 01:42:29.438
Well, you should know,
you write about me.

01:42:29.897 --> 01:42:31.748
You've kept it
absolutely secret.

01:42:31.772 --> 01:42:33.022
Not at all.

01:42:33.438 --> 01:42:36.605
We spoke before, remember?

01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:44.022
- That was you?
- Yes.

01:42:44.063 --> 01:42:46.331
- At the crossroads?
- Yes. Yes.

01:42:46.355 --> 01:42:48.730
I exist as two people.
At least two.

01:42:48.897 --> 01:42:50.956
A public and a private.

01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:54.331
Some people create their avatars
in a virtual world,

01:42:54.355 --> 01:42:56.164
I created mine in a real one.

01:42:56.188 --> 01:42:58.414
And I use my double
for public functions,

01:42:58.438 --> 01:43:00.289
just like Howard Hughes.

01:43:00.313 --> 01:43:02.164
Howard Hughes
didn't have a double.

01:43:02.188 --> 01:43:04.331
Oh, yes, he did.

01:43:04.355 --> 01:43:06.414
This guy who
wandered around two floors

01:43:06.438 --> 01:43:09.956
of a hotel in Las Vegas
wearing Kleenex boxes.

01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:11.688
Didn't particularly
look like him.

01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:15.623
Meanwhile, the real Hughes
was tending his garden

01:43:15.647 --> 01:43:17.272
on Martinique.

01:43:19.938 --> 01:43:24.272
I suspect you live
a double life as well.

01:43:24.313 --> 01:43:26.313
Now most of us do.

01:43:26.855 --> 01:43:30.605
We are the masters of fiction
in our lives.

01:43:51.730 --> 01:43:53.956
Hughes thought up
the idea of a double,

01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:56.355
so he could live in peace,

01:43:57.230 --> 01:44:00.873
but I can only feel peaceful
when I'm reduced to nothing

01:44:00.897 --> 01:44:02.938
and lying in my grave.

01:44:04.272 --> 01:44:08.022
What mattered most to Hughes
was his garden.

01:44:08.355 --> 01:44:10.105
To me, it's my own debt.

01:44:11.730 --> 01:44:13.563
And buying Navajo land.

01:44:15.105 --> 01:44:17.664
Valley of the Gods,
to be precise.

01:44:17.688 --> 01:44:18.980
And not to buy,

01:44:19.188 --> 01:44:22.688
but to open it up
for mineral exploitation.

01:44:23.063 --> 01:44:24.664
Uranium.

01:44:24.688 --> 01:44:25.980
Toxic stuff.

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.647
Mm.

01:44:28.813 --> 01:44:29.938
Mm-hm.

01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:33.730
Why do you keep your guests
imprisoned?

01:44:37.397 --> 01:44:40.706
I am trying
to help these lost souls

01:44:40.730 --> 01:44:42.248
get back to themselves.

01:44:42.272 --> 01:44:44.397
But tell me, why are you here?

01:44:45.813 --> 01:44:48.563
What exactly
do you hope to find out?

01:44:51.605 --> 01:44:52.855
Simply?

01:44:54.897 --> 01:44:57.480
What does it mean to be
the world's richest man?

01:44:59.438 --> 01:45:01.563
What is it
to have all that power?

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:06.605
To be able to do... anything.

01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:09.272
Do anything?

01:45:10.105 --> 01:45:14.688
Despite what you may think,
very little.

01:45:15.063 --> 01:45:18.022
Money only complicates things.

01:45:20.688 --> 01:45:23.605
Regardless
of how much money I have,

01:45:26.355 --> 01:45:29.355
I can't bring back my wife,

01:45:32.397 --> 01:45:33.938
or my daughter.

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:43.623
Rather it's you
who has the power,

01:45:43.647 --> 01:45:47.022
and with a stroke of a pen,
you can

01:45:47.147 --> 01:45:50.522
disarm, or maim, or kill,

01:45:52.688 --> 01:45:55.438
or open all the cages.

01:45:56.897 --> 01:45:58.313
Do you want to?

01:52:06.813 --> 01:52:08.605
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:53:33.272 --> 01:53:37.897
May your fertility
flow onto the soil,

01:53:38.022 --> 01:53:43.230
and your strength
let us make new soil.

01:53:43.647 --> 01:53:46.272
Holy soil, mountain soil.

01:53:46.730 --> 01:53:50.914
Mother Snake twists
around the mountain bed.

01:53:50.938 --> 01:53:56.105
People howl through the night
like coyotes in cages.

01:54:02.022 --> 01:54:07.730
May the sickness of your head
turn to cloud and go to heaven.

01:54:08.397 --> 01:54:14.230
May the sickness from your hand
the black earth take.

01:54:48.855 --> 01:54:53.855
Whatever sickness she has,

01:54:54.313 --> 01:54:57.188
take away, grandpa.

01:54:58.147 --> 01:55:01.188
Now the sun is risen,

01:55:01.772 --> 01:55:04.230
and I am woman.

01:55:08.730 --> 01:55:12.772
I wear my heart
where my people can see it.

01:55:13.230 --> 01:55:17.480
I had bled for centuries
of love.

01:55:17.938 --> 01:55:19.956
None of it wasted,

01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:21.897
none of it lost.
