00:02.085 --> 00:05.088
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:05.088 --> 00:06.556
Okay, guys, that's it.

00:06.556 --> 00:08.558
Closing time.

00:08.558 --> 00:10.060
Already?

00:10.560 --> 00:11.461
It's hard to believe

00:11.561 --> 00:15.065
17 hours could slip by that quickly.

00:15.065 --> 00:16.566
Well, good night, Sammy.

00:16.566 --> 00:19.069
Good night. Guys, don't
forget, tonight's the night

00:19.069 --> 00:20.570
we go off daylight savings time.

00:20.570 --> 00:23.073
Be sure to change your clocks.

00:23.073 --> 00:25.075
Let's see now, it's 2:00
now, so which way does it go?

00:25.075 --> 00:28.078
That's "spring forward,
fall back," Mr. Peterson.

00:28.078 --> 00:31.081
All right, so it's, uh, 1:00.

00:31.081 --> 00:32.582
1:00?

00:32.582 --> 00:33.583
Set 'em up, Sammy.

00:36.086 --> 00:39.089
I was this close to going home.

00:39.089 --> 00:40.957
I love this universe.

00:42.926 --> 00:46.763
(piano plays)

00:46.763 --> 00:49.215
? Making your way in the world today ?

00:49.215 --> 00:52.218
? Takes everything you've got ?

00:52.218 --> 00:55.221
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

00:55.221 --> 00:58.224
? Sure would help a lot ?

00:58.224 --> 01:03.613
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:03.613 --> 01:06.399
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:06.399 --> 01:11.404
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:11.404 --> 01:16.409
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:16.409 --> 01:18.411
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:18.411 --> 01:21.414
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:21.414 --> 01:26.419
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:26.419 --> 01:29.422
? You want to go where people know ?

01:29.422 --> 01:31.424
? People are all the same ?

01:31.424 --> 01:36.429
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

01:56.833 --> 01:58.334
Afternoon, Sam. Everyone.

01:58.334 --> 01:59.836
Hey, Frasier.

01:59.836 --> 02:00.837
What's wrong?

02:00.837 --> 02:02.839
You look like you lost your best friend.

02:02.839 --> 02:05.208
Well, in a manner of speaking, I have.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.510
A colleague of sorts passed away today.

02:07.510 --> 02:11.514
Someone who contributed volumes
to the world of psychology.

02:12.015 --> 02:14.017
Well, I'm sorry. Is it anybody I know?

02:14.017 --> 02:15.852
Bombo the chimpanzee.

02:15.852 --> 02:17.604
Oh.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.105
Don't you remember, Sam?

02:19.105 --> 02:20.607
They shared an office.

02:23.109 --> 02:26.112
See, Bombo was one of
Dr. Harry Harlow's apes.

02:26.112 --> 02:28.982
Dr. Harlow was a behavioral theorist

02:28.982 --> 02:30.483
who worked extensively with primates

02:30.483 --> 02:32.902
studying human parenting
and child rearing.

02:33.870 --> 02:35.872
Bombo was the last of the group.

02:35.872 --> 02:37.373
And he was the baby.

02:37.373 --> 02:38.374
I can still see him

02:38.875 --> 02:42.879
clutching his little
cloth surrogate mother.

02:42.879 --> 02:44.881
I don't think we'll
ever see his like again.

02:44.881 --> 02:45.882
Can I get you anything?

02:46.382 --> 02:48.885
Please. Something to take
my mind off my troubles.

02:48.885 --> 02:51.387
How about a banana daiquiri?

02:54.224 --> 02:55.508
Cute. Yeah.

02:59.979 --> 03:01.347
Good afternoon, everyone.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.148
Hello.

03:02.148 --> 03:05.151
Oh, hello, my darling.

03:05.151 --> 03:08.021
Oh, my, will you look at that ring.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.740
My boyfriend gave it to me.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.027
You'll have to pardon my giddiness.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.529
I am in such a glorious mood today.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.531
I don't think anything could spoil it.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.033
Bombo is dead.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.539
Nope. Not even that.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.541
I have been selected to serve

03:28.541 --> 03:30.543
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

03:30.543 --> 03:32.929
on jury duty.

03:32.929 --> 03:34.130
(groaning) I'm so sorry.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.348
That's awful.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.100
They tried to get me once,

03:37.100 --> 03:39.102
but I got off 'cause
I got a good excuse.

03:39.102 --> 03:41.104
I'm the sole support of six kids.

03:42.605 --> 03:44.107
I suppose they felt that anyone

03:44.107 --> 03:45.608
who hadn't mastered birth control

03:45.608 --> 03:48.111
isn't smart enough for jury duty.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.783
You know, I tried to serve,
but they disqualified me. Yeah?

03:53.783 --> 03:56.152
Yeah. I can't understand it,
'cause they went for my theory.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.070
What theory's that?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.322
The one about, uh, bringing
back the guillotine.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.125
Gee, they, uh, turned you down, huh?

04:02.125 --> 04:04.043
I guess the old inmates
are running the asylum, huh?

04:05.628 --> 04:08.631
Well, I'm honored to have been chosen

04:08.631 --> 04:12.001
to participate in our
system of jurisprudence.

04:12.001 --> 04:15.388
I'll be proud to serve
on a jury of my peers.

04:15.388 --> 04:16.889
Or so they'll think.

04:19.841 --> 04:22.178
You know, other than voting,

04:22.178 --> 04:25.598
I think jury duty is the
single greatest privilege

04:25.598 --> 04:27.483
America bestows on her citizenry.

04:27.483 --> 04:28.685
Couldn't get out of it, huh?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.353
I tried everything.

04:34.324 --> 04:37.243
Hey, you know who that is?

04:37.243 --> 04:38.111
Yeah.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.612
Oh, yeah, it's Eddie LeBec.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.998
NORM: Eddie LeBec right here. All right.

04:41.998 --> 04:42.915
Wow, Eddie LeBec.

04:42.915 --> 04:45.201
Who is Eddie LeBec?

04:45.201 --> 04:47.003
Well, if they're
excited about seeing him,

04:47.003 --> 04:49.005
he's either a sports figure

04:49.005 --> 04:51.007
or he holds the world's record

04:51.007 --> 04:54.010
for stuffing beer nuts up his nose.

04:54.010 --> 04:57.513
Uh-uh-uh, that is Jimmy
"The Snorkel" Stevens, Diane.

04:57.513 --> 04:58.381
Yeah, he's a, uh,

04:58.381 --> 04:59.799
new goalie for the Bruins.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.301
Hey, that old guy is hardly new.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.519
He's been around the league
for a while. Yeah, but since

05:03.519 --> 05:05.355
the Bruins picked him up,
he's won five in a row.

05:05.355 --> 05:06.856
FRASIER: Boy, the injustice of it.

05:06.856 --> 05:09.142
A man rises to such popular acclaim

05:09.142 --> 05:11.811
simply by stopping a
hockey puck with his face...

05:13.813 --> 05:14.814
...while a courageous little chimp

05:15.315 --> 05:17.200
who advanced man's scientific knowledge

05:17.200 --> 05:20.069
dies almost anonymously.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.955
You should have gotten the
monkey a pair of skates.

05:24.874 --> 05:26.159
You know, I've always had this thing

05:26.659 --> 05:27.660
for the goalies and catchers.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.662
Guys who wear masks.

05:29.662 --> 05:33.049
Some girls like the scorers,
you know, the glamour guys?

05:33.049 --> 05:36.302
Me, I like the grunts who crouch down

05:36.302 --> 05:38.805
and take everything
that's thrown at them--

05:38.805 --> 05:40.673
scarred faces,

05:40.673 --> 05:44.010
teeth missing, noses
mashed to a meaty pulp.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.897
God, they're sexy.

05:47.897 --> 05:49.816
He's looking pretty
thirsty over there, Carla.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.818
Why don't you, uh...?
Ooh, let me at him.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.191
Hi, there.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.528
Uh, could I have a glass
of club soda, no ice,

06:02.528 --> 06:05.415
two slices of lime and
a red straw, please?

06:11.838 --> 06:15.341
Club soda, no ice, two slices of lime,

06:15.341 --> 06:16.342
and a red straw, please.

06:16.342 --> 06:19.846
Sam, a... club, club soda...

06:19.846 --> 06:21.214
Yep, I heard, I heard, I heard.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.599
Yeah, that was masterful, Carla.

06:23.599 --> 06:25.601
Hey, you know what,

06:25.601 --> 06:27.603
you know what line I
think really won his heart?

06:33.609 --> 06:35.561
Wow, Eddie LeBec.

06:35.561 --> 06:39.065
It sure is exciting seeing
a sports figure in real life.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.571
What about, what about me, Woody?

06:45.571 --> 06:47.073
Well, I can't speak for you, Sam.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.075
I only know I'm excited.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.080
Oh, thank you.

06:57.083 --> 07:01.087
Uh, Eddie, uh...

07:01.087 --> 07:02.588
sorry I'm a little tongue-tied.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.590
I... I guess it's because

07:04.590 --> 07:06.592
I'm really a big fan of yours.

07:06.592 --> 07:07.593
Oh, really? Yeah.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.594
You know who I am?

07:08.594 --> 07:10.596
Are you kidding?

07:10.596 --> 07:13.599
Eddie LeBec, born Hull, Quebec.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.102
Drafted out of the
juniors in the fifth round

07:16.102 --> 07:17.603
to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.105
Played for a year with the Leafs,

07:19.105 --> 07:21.107
then traded to the Winnipeg Jets,

07:21.107 --> 07:23.109
then to Calgary, then to Boston. Wow.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.361
Two game misconducts, 78 and 81.

07:25.361 --> 07:28.197
Currently leads the
league in goals against.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.699
Mm-hmm. Unmarried.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.701
Favorite number
is 5-5-5-7-8-4-3.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.704
What's that?

07:34.704 --> 07:36.205
Where I can be reached at night.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.707
Oh.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.208
Well, heh,

07:39.208 --> 07:40.460
it's really nice meeting you.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.294
Carla. Oh.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.795
Carla Tortelli. Hey.

07:42.795 --> 07:43.796
Could I get you some pretzels?

07:43.796 --> 07:45.798
Oh, no, I just drink, uh, one club soda,

07:45.798 --> 07:46.799
no ice, two slices of lime

07:47.300 --> 07:48.801
and a, and a red straw
before every game.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.303
Oh, superstitious, huh?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.304
Oh, uh, no.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.806
Just things have been going
so well for me here in Boston,

07:53.806 --> 07:55.308
I, uh, don't want to do anything

07:55.308 --> 07:56.809
that might change that, you know?

07:56.809 --> 07:58.060
Oh, right.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.862
Well, uh, what other little rituals

07:59.862 --> 08:00.863
do you have?

08:00.863 --> 08:02.865
Oh, I don't know.

08:02.865 --> 08:05.735
Uh, I brush my teeth every day.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.652
(both chuckling)

08:06.652 --> 08:08.154
No kidding. I, um...

08:08.154 --> 08:09.155
I don't know.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.158
I lace my left skate
first, then my right skate.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.159
Left and right, yeah.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.661
And, um, since my
winning streak started,

08:15.661 --> 08:18.080
I, I wear my underwear inside out.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.585
You are really a fascinating guy.

08:22.585 --> 08:26.589
Oh, gosh, Carla, you
know, I, I got to go.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.590
Uh... Yeah.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.591
It was really nice meeting you.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.093
Yeah, you, too. Yeah, thank you.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.094
Say, Carla,

08:32.094 --> 08:34.597
would you like my tickets
for tonight's game?

08:34.597 --> 08:35.597
Whoa! Yeah, well,

08:35.597 --> 08:37.600
you can just pick them up at Will Call.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.602
Oh, thanks!

08:39.602 --> 08:41.102
It was really nice meeting you.

08:41.102 --> 08:43.105
You too, Eddie. Okay.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.106
Bye. Bye.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.108
See you.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.111
Guys! Guys, guys, get this!

08:49.111 --> 08:52.114
I've got Eddie's tickets
to the Garden tonight!

08:52.615 --> 08:53.616
NORM: No way!

08:53.616 --> 08:54.500
Bruins and Canadiens.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.253
Seats so choice you can smell the sweat.

08:57.253 --> 08:59.121
CLIFF: Oh, yeah.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.123
Anybody want the other ticket?

09:01.123 --> 09:03.626
Oh, God, I'd love to go, but I can't.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.627
I got to work.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.629
Oh, too bad, Sam.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.047
Wait a minute.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.433
Don't you have to work, too?

09:10.433 --> 09:14.220
You don't think you can
keep me here, do you?

09:14.220 --> 09:19.225
Come on, what happened to "Sam,
could I please have the night off?"

09:19.725 --> 09:22.728
Sam, may I please have the night off?

09:22.728 --> 09:24.230
Yes.

09:24.230 --> 09:28.234
See how easy it is if you just ask?

09:28.234 --> 09:29.235
So, who's it going to be?

09:29.235 --> 09:31.237
(Norm and Cliff clamoring)

09:31.237 --> 09:32.238
Well, I only have one.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.739
(frantic pleading continues)

09:33.739 --> 09:35.241
Cliff, Cliff, wait a second now.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.743
I mean, our friendship's
a little too important

09:37.743 --> 09:40.246
to be ripped apart
by something as stupid

09:40.246 --> 09:41.747
as a hockey ticket, all right?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.749
Well, I guess you're right, Normie.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.751
A sporting event's only for a few hours.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.003
Friendship like ours

09:47.003 --> 09:48.804
lasts forever. Right. There you go.

09:48.804 --> 09:51.724
So, who's going to take
it? (both clamoring)

09:51.724 --> 09:52.725
None of you, you, you.

09:52.725 --> 09:53.726
Get out of here!

09:53.726 --> 09:55.227
Isn't there anybody else?

09:55.227 --> 09:56.512
What about Frasier?

09:56.512 --> 09:58.981
Hey, Frasier, you look like
you could use a pick-me-up.

09:58.981 --> 09:59.849
A hockey game?

10:00.349 --> 10:01.350
SAM: Yeah.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.351
No, thank you.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.353
I've been to the bullfights in Spain.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.355
I've been to the altar with Diane.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.608
I think that's enough
carnage for one life.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.945
Oh, come on, Frasier, go.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.948
Bombo would have wanted you to.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.950
Perhaps you're right.

10:19.335 --> 10:22.204
You know, I've always wondered
what makes the average person

10:22.204 --> 10:24.206
turn into an animal at a sporting event.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.708
Perhaps I could witness the phenomenon

10:25.708 --> 10:27.209
and write a paper on it.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.711
Put Dr. Frasier Crane back on the map.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.713
Carla, thank you. I accept.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.466
Well, at least I won't
be fondled all night.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.271
Man, what a game!

10:39.271 --> 10:41.273
Eddie stopped 40 shots!

10:41.273 --> 10:42.274
NORM: Oh!

10:42.274 --> 10:45.778
I mean, I haven't seen a
guy have a night like that

10:45.778 --> 10:49.281
since Harmon Killebrew hit
those three moon-shot homers

10:49.281 --> 10:50.783
off of you, Sam.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.785
Yes, I was certainly lucky

10:52.785 --> 10:54.787
to be there to see that, wasn't I?

10:54.787 --> 10:56.789
Then at the end of the game

10:56.789 --> 11:00.292
when the crowd was giving
Eddie his standing "O,"

11:00.292 --> 11:02.795
he skated right past me and spit.

11:05.297 --> 11:07.299
Well, you're very lucky, Carla.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.802
Most men would have been embarrassed

11:09.802 --> 11:12.805
to make such a show
of affection in public.

11:12.805 --> 11:15.307
You know, I got to believe you're right.

11:15.307 --> 11:17.309
Yeah, Carla, where's Frasier?

11:17.309 --> 11:18.811
I don't know. The last I saw of him,

11:18.811 --> 11:20.813
they were hauling him
off in a security van.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.984
Well, just curious.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.318
"Security van"?

11:26.318 --> 11:27.820
What happened?

11:27.820 --> 11:29.321
I don't know. I was watching the game.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.823
I guess there was some kind of scuffle.

11:30.823 --> 11:31.824
He got caught up in it.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.192
(laughing)

11:33.192 --> 11:36.162
Good Lord!

11:37.530 --> 11:39.415
Oh, hey, Carla, look who came back, eh?

11:41.417 --> 11:42.918
I'm sure he's not here just to see me.

11:42.918 --> 11:43.919
Yeah?

11:43.919 --> 11:44.920
Carla,

11:44.920 --> 11:47.423
the man spit.

11:51.927 --> 11:53.929
Hey, great game, Eddie.

11:53.929 --> 11:54.930
(both laughing)

11:54.930 --> 11:55.931
Thanks, Carla.

11:55.931 --> 11:56.932
Want a beer? Yeah, sure.

11:56.932 --> 11:59.435
Beer, Sam.

12:01.437 --> 12:02.938
So, uh...

12:02.938 --> 12:04.940
what're you doing back here?

12:04.940 --> 12:05.941
Well, I'm kind of new in Boston.

12:05.941 --> 12:07.309
I really don't know anybody.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.730
That'll be all.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.235
Well, how about the
other guys on the team?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.119
I don't know.

12:17.119 --> 12:19.121
Most of the other
guys are, I don't know,

12:19.121 --> 12:20.623
married or they have girlfriends,

12:20.623 --> 12:23.626
so I just thought I'd
come back and see...

12:24.126 --> 12:25.127
you know, how you liked your seats.

12:25.127 --> 12:26.629
Loved 'em!

12:26.629 --> 12:29.632
I like your seat, too.

12:29.632 --> 12:32.001
Carla, you coquette.

12:34.336 --> 12:35.254
Say, uh, Carla,

12:35.254 --> 12:36.806
you, can you come around and sit down

12:36.806 --> 12:39.308
and, uh, maybe we can talk a little bit.

12:39.308 --> 12:40.309
Sure!

12:43.312 --> 12:45.314
Oh, thanks.

12:47.817 --> 12:50.319
So, you're a hockey fan, eh?

12:50.820 --> 12:52.321
Oh, yeah.

12:52.321 --> 12:53.322
Well...

12:53.322 --> 12:55.191
what else should I know about you?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.993
Me? Well, uh,

12:57.993 --> 13:01.947
I'm in my mid-20s,

13:01.947 --> 13:04.950
never been married,

13:04.950 --> 13:06.836
got no kids.

13:06.836 --> 13:10.122
You're next in line to
the throne of England.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.431
Dr. Frasier Crane,

13:19.431 --> 13:21.934
noted psychiatrist,

13:21.934 --> 13:24.436
winner of the Mildred Bergen Fellowship,

13:24.436 --> 13:28.440
author of 27 published
articles, is out on bail.

13:31.944 --> 13:33.946
Frasier, what happened?

13:33.946 --> 13:35.447
Well, you know, I've
always prided myself

13:35.447 --> 13:36.949
on being a man of control and maturity.

13:36.949 --> 13:41.954
But suddenly I was swept up
into this crowd's excitement.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.456
Well, damn me to a junior
college for saying it,

13:44.456 --> 13:46.959
I was enjoying myself.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.327
But I guess

13:48.327 --> 13:50.796
the controlled mayhem of the situation

13:50.796 --> 13:52.298
made me more assertive.

13:52.298 --> 13:53.799
Also, there was this guy
sitting in front of me

13:53.799 --> 13:55.301
who insisted on wearing his cowboy hat.

13:55.301 --> 13:59.805
Well, I asked this huckleberry
several times to remove it,

13:59.805 --> 14:01.307
and he refused,

14:01.307 --> 14:03.809
and so then I just took it off
his head and handed it to him,

14:03.809 --> 14:05.060
and he handed it back to
me with his fist in it.

14:05.060 --> 14:07.263
(laughs)

14:07.263 --> 14:08.647
Next thing I know,

14:08.647 --> 14:11.150
I'm in a holding cell at
some North End station house

14:11.150 --> 14:13.102
with the cast of The Road Warrior.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.906
Did you get Mel Gibson's autograph?

14:21.577 --> 14:23.412
So, uh, so you had a little fight.

14:23.412 --> 14:24.413
You stood up for yourself.

14:24.413 --> 14:26.665
Come on, look me in the
eye face-to-face here.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.751
Didn't it feel great?

14:30.586 --> 14:31.587
Well, I have to admit,

14:31.587 --> 14:33.088
(chuckles)

14:33.088 --> 14:34.089
There was a moment there

14:34.089 --> 14:35.591
when I had a feeling of satisfaction

14:35.591 --> 14:37.092
like never before in my life.

14:37.092 --> 14:38.093
Sorry, Diane.

14:38.093 --> 14:39.595
Oh...

14:41.463 --> 14:43.966
So, Carla, I'd better
get back to my place.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.967
I gotta look at some films.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.970
I just, uh, I don't know,

14:47.970 --> 14:51.974
I just wanted to stop in
and see, you know, just...

14:51.974 --> 14:52.975
Hey, Eddie, you know,

14:52.975 --> 14:54.977
I really should be honest with you.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.479
I do have kids. Two.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.480
Well, I love kids.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.482
Six.

15:02.451 --> 15:04.453
I'd still like to see ya again, okay?

15:04.453 --> 15:05.454
Oh, anytime.

15:05.955 --> 15:07.456
Okay.

15:08.457 --> 15:10.459
No, no, no, no.

15:10.459 --> 15:12.962
If these guys, you know,
find out that you kissed me,

15:12.962 --> 15:14.964
that's all I'd be hearing
about for the next month.

15:14.964 --> 15:16.465
All right. Come on.

15:23.839 --> 15:24.840
He kissed me!

15:32.381 --> 15:34.383
Well, Sam, that was my lawyer.

15:34.383 --> 15:35.884
He's managed to get the authorities

15:36.385 --> 15:37.386
to drop all the charges.

15:37.386 --> 15:38.387
All right. Okay.

15:38.387 --> 15:40.389
Got off scot-free, huh?

15:40.389 --> 15:41.390
Not exactly.

15:41.390 --> 15:43.892
It seems I have to undergo seven hours

15:43.892 --> 15:45.894
of psychological counseling.

15:48.397 --> 15:50.399
Man, it is busy back there, Sam.

15:50.399 --> 15:54.403
So, uh, Carla, you're seeing
old #33 again tonight, huh?

15:54.903 --> 15:57.406
No, Cliff, Eddie's got a game tonight.

15:57.406 --> 15:58.907
Yeah, after a couple of nights with you,

15:58.907 --> 15:59.908
he's looking for something

15:59.908 --> 16:01.410
a little less strenuous to do, eh?

16:02.411 --> 16:06.415
Listen, you couch potatoes,
don't get the wrong idea.

16:06.415 --> 16:08.417
There's nothing serious between us.

16:08.417 --> 16:09.418
We're just friends.

16:09.418 --> 16:12.338
Well, you say that, Carla,
but why am I picking up

16:12.338 --> 16:14.757
the subtle fragrance of la belle amour?

16:16.258 --> 16:19.144
You know, I like Eddie well enough.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.146
And... what can I say?

16:21.146 --> 16:23.148
It's kind of a kick dating a star.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.516
I mean,

16:24.516 --> 16:26.402
I've never been out before with a guy

16:26.402 --> 16:28.404
who has a driver come and pick him up

16:28.404 --> 16:29.905
and take him anywhere he wants to go.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.190
Ooh, he's got a limousine?

16:31.190 --> 16:32.574
No, he has me.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.078
But he pays for everything.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.080
You know, movies, parking, refreshments.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.583
Do you know how much a tub of
popcorn is going for these days?

16:41.583 --> 16:43.085
It's, uh, $3.70 at the Alto.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.090
Yeah, that Eddie takes
care of me real good.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.592
But you're not falling for him, right?

16:50.592 --> 16:53.595
Oh, look, who are we fooling here, Sam?

16:53.595 --> 16:55.597
I mean, you know my luck with men.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.599
You can't swing a dead cat

16:57.599 --> 17:00.602
without hitting some bum
who once dumped on me.

17:02.554 --> 17:04.056
And...

17:04.556 --> 17:07.559
Eddie LeBec is a star.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.560
You know, once he's been here a while,

17:09.560 --> 17:12.564
he'll know a lot more people,
and it's "Bye-bye, Carla."

17:12.564 --> 17:13.565
Hey. No way

17:13.565 --> 17:15.534
some guy like that ends up with me.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.536
Listen, will you stop
cutting yourself short?

17:17.536 --> 17:19.038
You offer a lot of things to a guy.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.040
Oh, yeah, sure. Six kids,

17:22.040 --> 17:24.542
mortgage up to my ears, stack of bills,

17:24.542 --> 17:27.046
dead-end job and fallen arches.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.298
You know, if I weren't
already engaged...

17:31.133 --> 17:32.634
Hi, Sam.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.086
Hello.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.087
Sorry I'm late.

17:35.087 --> 17:38.090
The first day of the trial went
a little longer than I expected.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.091
Oh, that's all right.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.592
Just grab an apron.

17:40.592 --> 17:43.095
We got the Bruins playing tonight.

17:43.095 --> 17:45.097
And the Eddie LeBec Fan
Club is holding forth,

17:45.097 --> 17:47.099
led by President Carla Tortelli.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.101
Right. Luck of the draw.

17:49.101 --> 17:50.102
I think I have gotten

17:50.602 --> 17:53.605
the most challenging and
interesting case of the year.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.607
Oh, that's great. Listen,
do me a favor, will ya?

17:55.607 --> 17:57.609
Go upstairs and get
me some change, please?

17:57.609 --> 17:58.610
Fine.

17:58.610 --> 18:02.614
Of course, I can't discuss
the details of the trial,

18:02.614 --> 18:04.616
but, oh, only if I could.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.618
Quarters. Mostly quarters, yeah.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.620
I can tell you that

18:08.620 --> 18:11.123
I've been chosen foreman of the jury.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.125
Well, that's great.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.627
Yeah, listen, you do good
with this change thing,

18:15.627 --> 18:17.629
and I'll make you captain of the bar.

18:19.631 --> 18:21.633
Well...

18:21.633 --> 18:24.136
just as well that I'm leaving.

18:24.136 --> 18:28.140
I wouldn't want to slip and
divulge too much information.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.642
Particularly in this case.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.645
Attempted murder.

18:34.646 --> 18:35.647
(chuckles)

18:36.148 --> 18:39.151
This is the last place
I'd talk about it.

18:39.151 --> 18:41.153
Once I let something out,

18:41.153 --> 18:45.157
you'd all be prodding
me endlessly for details.

18:45.157 --> 18:46.658
Sammy, is Diane coming in today?

18:46.658 --> 18:48.160
(chuckling): Yeah.

18:49.661 --> 18:51.663
Hey, folks.

18:51.663 --> 18:53.549
Hey, Sam. Hey.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.550
Hey, Carla. NORM: Eddie.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.551
How you doing?

18:55.551 --> 18:57.553
Woody, get that man a club soda,

18:57.553 --> 18:59.054
no ice, two slices of lime,

18:59.054 --> 19:00.055
and a red straw.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.056
(chuckles)

19:01.056 --> 19:03.559
Is that really what you want? Yes, sir.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.427
How'd you know that, Sam?

19:06.395 --> 19:08.397
He ordered it yesterday.

19:08.397 --> 19:11.400
Oh, well, then I'd better hurry.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.023
You know, I used to, uh...

19:18.023 --> 19:19.525
I used to have this little ritual

19:19.525 --> 19:21.026
when I was pitching for the Red Sox.

19:21.026 --> 19:22.027
Mm-hmm.

19:22.027 --> 19:23.529
Before every game,

19:23.529 --> 19:27.032
I'd go out to our third base
coach, Ernie Pantusso, and...

19:27.032 --> 19:30.035
he'd rub my tummy and I'd rub his head.

19:30.035 --> 19:31.036
Next thing we knew,

19:31.036 --> 19:33.038
the whole stadium was
looking at two grown men

19:33.038 --> 19:36.041
standing in the middle of
the field rubbing each other.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.545
After that we, we did
it in the locker room.

19:40.546 --> 19:43.549
Pretty soon after that,
we just stopped altogether.

19:43.549 --> 19:47.553
Anyway, all I know is that

19:47.553 --> 19:49.555
I've never played better
than, than this in my life.

19:49.555 --> 19:50.556
Yeah?

19:50.556 --> 19:53.058
The puck's looking as big as a frisbee.

19:53.058 --> 19:54.560
My reactions are quicker than ever.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.562
I've never been happier.

19:56.562 --> 19:58.564
I'm not gonna do anything
to break my routine.

19:58.564 --> 20:01.066
(Sam laughs)

20:01.066 --> 20:03.068
Except to add one thing.

20:10.576 --> 20:12.077
Whoa.

20:12.578 --> 20:15.080
I'm dedicating tonight's game to you.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.083
SAM: Good night, Eddie.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.084
Good night.

20:19.084 --> 20:20.085
Hey, Eddie.

20:20.085 --> 20:21.086
Your wallet fell out of your coat.

20:21.086 --> 20:24.089
Oh.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.091
(chuckles)

20:26.091 --> 20:27.092
(laughs)

20:27.092 --> 20:28.594
Stop kidding around.

20:28.594 --> 20:31.096
Okay, I'll see ya.

20:31.096 --> 20:33.348
He's always kidding around.

20:33.348 --> 20:35.150
(Carla laughing)

20:38.520 --> 20:40.072
SPORTS ANNOUNCER: ...is on the attack.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.907
They bring it out on center
ice now on the red line.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.408
The puck is tipped away, Flyers.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.277
The Bruins get it back again, and...

20:45.277 --> 20:52.284
Of course, I can't really
talk about the trial.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.786
No, no, I had the vodka gimlet.

20:54.786 --> 20:56.788
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

20:56.788 --> 21:00.792
I could, I suppose, give
you a hypothetical case,

21:00.792 --> 21:02.294
just to give you an idea.

21:02.794 --> 21:06.298
Not that it would be
the same, but similar.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.300
Now, we have a defendant

21:08.300 --> 21:12.304
who's accused of attempted
murder of his wife.

21:12.304 --> 21:14.306
We'll call him Scum.

21:15.307 --> 21:16.808
And a wife.

21:16.808 --> 21:18.810
Let's call her Victim.

21:21.313 --> 21:23.815
I really shouldn't be telling you this.

21:23.815 --> 21:25.817
It's just that I can't help it.

21:25.817 --> 21:28.820
I'm compelled to share it with someone.

21:28.820 --> 21:31.823
But no, no, I'm not
going to say another word.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.293
I'm going to zip my mouth. (chuckles)

21:34.293 --> 21:35.794
Can I get you anything else?

21:35.794 --> 21:37.796
No, zipping your mouth will be fine.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.799
(yelling)

21:41.800 --> 21:43.719
Hey, how much time we got left?

21:43.719 --> 21:44.720
Minute and a half.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.221
Oh, come on, Eddie. Come on. You got it.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.222
He's got to be the greatest.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.224
I mean, three periods and overtime,

21:49.224 --> 21:50.726
and the Flyers have only
put one in against him.

21:50.726 --> 21:51.727
Sure.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.228
Man, can he ever hold them.

21:53.228 --> 21:54.229
Oh, you think he can hold 'em?

21:54.229 --> 21:55.731
I've had four beers this period alone.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.733
I have not left this
barstool. All right?

21:57.733 --> 22:00.235
(grumbling, laughing)

22:00.235 --> 22:01.103
Give me an A.

22:01.103 --> 22:02.020
A!

22:02.020 --> 22:02.521
Give me a B!

22:02.521 --> 22:03.438
B!

22:03.438 --> 22:03.939
Give me a C!

22:03.939 --> 22:04.906
C!

22:04.906 --> 22:05.407
Give me a D!

22:05.407 --> 22:06.358
D!

22:06.358 --> 22:07.859
Wait, wait a minute,
Woody. What're you doing?

22:07.859 --> 22:09.745
The alphabet. We're warming up here.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.079
Give me a...

22:15.083 --> 22:20.088
What exactly is the
definition of attempted murder?

22:20.088 --> 22:22.591
Does... does the accused

22:22.591 --> 22:25.093
actually have to go through
with the crime and fail?

22:25.093 --> 22:27.596
Or is it our duty

22:27.596 --> 22:32.434
to look into his craven heart
and determine his intent?

22:33.268 --> 22:35.771
I mean, how often does
someone just happen

22:35.771 --> 22:37.606
to lose control of a power saw?

22:39.441 --> 22:40.442
(yelling)

22:40.442 --> 22:42.811
CARLA: Come on, Eddie!
I'm here! I'm with you!

22:42.811 --> 22:44.696
Uh, Carla, he picked a heck of
a game to dedicate to you, huh?

22:44.696 --> 22:45.947
CARLA: You're telling me.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.733
Sammy. Sam, would you look at me?

22:47.733 --> 22:49.234
I'm on top of the world.

22:49.234 --> 22:50.736
I'm Eddie LeBec's chick.

22:50.736 --> 22:53.238
I mean, I am dating the
hottest goalie in the league,

22:53.238 --> 22:54.740
and everybody knows me.

22:54.740 --> 22:58.243
For once in my life, I
really feel like I'm somebody.

22:58.243 --> 23:00.996
(yelling)

23:00.996 --> 23:02.831
No, no, no, the Flyers stole it!

23:02.831 --> 23:04.332
Now, don't worry, boys.

23:04.332 --> 23:06.334
It's time for the old
Tortelli lucky charm.

23:06.334 --> 23:09.588
Eddie, for you.

23:09.588 --> 23:11.306
Battle for the puck along the boards.

23:11.306 --> 23:13.175
Time running out. Doesn't look like

23:13.175 --> 23:15.177
they'll get a shot off.
Five seconds, four seconds.

23:15.177 --> 23:18.063
Brock plays it on the boards
and Fratti shoots. He scores!

23:18.063 --> 23:19.481
The winning goal for Philadelphia!

23:19.481 --> 23:20.732
The game is over on a shot

23:20.732 --> 23:22.517
that LeBec should have
blocked in his sleep.

23:22.517 --> 23:25.020
(TV shuts off)

23:25.020 --> 23:26.521
(whistles) Great.

23:26.521 --> 23:29.024
Eddie blew it.

23:29.024 --> 23:31.493
Just my luck.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.361
You know,

23:33.361 --> 23:37.115
if it was me in that fairy
tale, and I kissed the frog,

23:37.115 --> 23:40.118
he'd end up turning into a lizard.

23:40.118 --> 23:42.621
One who couldn't go to his left.

23:42.621 --> 23:43.622
Come on, come on, come on.

23:43.622 --> 23:44.623
Lighten up on him.

23:44.623 --> 23:46.124
He just had an off night, that's all.

23:46.124 --> 23:47.626
I mean, that guy is gonna take us

23:47.626 --> 23:49.010
all the way to the Stanley Cup.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.462
(all murmuring agreement)

23:50.462 --> 23:52.964
You're right. I mean,
what am I saying? Yeah.

23:52.964 --> 23:55.467
He'll bounce back tomorrow.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.853
You bet. He'll be fine.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.221
Inside of a week,

23:59.221 --> 24:03.225
that Muyaak will be ice
fishing in Nova Scotia.
