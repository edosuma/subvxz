<i>You went to the police, Rose.
Made my life very difficult.</i>

00:04.040 --> 00:05.087
Peter?

00:05.240 --> 00:07.049
No!

00:07.200 --> 00:09.646
Her first appointment at work
was at eight this morning.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.929
She didn't turn up, no word from her either.
This has never happened before.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.209
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see a patient.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.362
Annie, I'm Paul Spector.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.488
“Where's the peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked?"

00:22.640 --> 00:26.486
- Did you learn that at school?
- No. From Peter Piper. Mummy's friend.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.927
I warned you once before.
This is your last warning.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.081
Good.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.720
<i>They've managed to lift
a partial print from the scissors.</i>

00:32.880 --> 00:35.963
<i>We We run it through the system
and found a match. Paul Spector.</i>

00:36.120 --> 00:37.884
What have you done with Rose Stagg?

00:38.040 --> 00:42.409
Stella, I don't know what's gonna happen
to me, to you, to anyone else in this world-.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.325
<i>All I know is, no one can out-wit death.</i>

02:31.480 --> 02:33.369
Hey, cutie.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.046
Hey, cutie. Hello.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.602
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.490
- Did you get any sleep?
- A little.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.002
What's he doing here?

02:59.680 --> 03:02.889
- Eastwood's your new deputy SIO.
- Excuse me?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.682
Garrett Brink is tied up with a court case.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.241
McIlroy has further blood tests to undergo.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.482
And you need someone, and urgently.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.929
So is he keeping an eye on me,
or am I keeping an eye on him?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.802
Make it work.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.442
Don’t worry, we'll beautify it for you.

03:51.160 --> 03:54.164
- Good to have you on board.
- Likewise.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.882
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.970
- Good morning, everybody.
- Morning, ma'am.

04:31.120 --> 04:36.524
I am pleased to say we are about to take
a very significant step in our investigation.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.402
This is a formal declaration that from now on

04:39.560 --> 04:44.248
the inquiry will be focusing
on a particular individual.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.881
Our prime suspect...

04:49.040 --> 04:51.042
Paul Spector.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.326
<i>Paul Spector was caught on CCTV at the
Botanic Gardens on Saturday the 14th of April...</i>

04:59.400 --> 05:02.290
<i>..the day that Sarah Kay
was there with her sister.</i>

05:02.960 --> 05:09.206
He came in to the police station on Saturday
the 21st and was interviewed by DCI Brink.

05:09.800 --> 05:14.886
He gave his DNA and his fingerprints
and was at that point eliminated.

05:16.640 --> 05:23.444
We now have tangible evidence to link Paul
Spector to the murder of Joe Brawley.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.808
Namely his fingerprints,
on a pair of decorating shears,

05:27.960 --> 05:30.884
identical to a pair purchased by Annie Brawley.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.925
<i>Do we need to put an arrest strategy in place?</i>

05:37.080 --> 05:38.650
<i>Not yet.</i>

05:38.800 --> 05:42.930
<i>There's very good reason for believing
that Paul Spector is also responsible</i>

05:43.080 --> 05:46.687
<i>for the abduction
and unlawful imprisonment of Rose Stagg.</i>

05:47.800 --> 05:51.441
Last night I received a phone call
on my old private number

05:51.600 --> 05:54.570
from Rose Stagg's mobile phone.

05:54.720 --> 05:58.691
The call he made on Roses phone last night
has been triangulated.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.127
We have a location. A search is underway.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.970
We have a live cell trace
on Spector's registered mobile phone

06:05.120 --> 06:06.929
and we have his historic phone records.

06:07.080 --> 06:11.051
I mean, right now that phone is off.
But we know he has access to other phones.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.010
He made calls in Scotland
so we know he did go away.

06:14.800 --> 06:19.124
Yesterday he made and received a call
in the vicinity of the City Hospital in Belfast

06:19.280 --> 06:20.884
so we know he's back.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.769
Does he have a car?

06:22.920 --> 06:26.322
He reported his car as stolen
the day after the Brawley murder.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.528
It was a Peugeot 405.

06:28.680 --> 06:33.242
Sierra, India, Whisky, 3160.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.721
- Has he made an insurance claim?
- No.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.882
We need to find that oar-.

07:13.880 --> 07:17.646
DCI Matt Eastwood is my new deputy SIO.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.085
Thus far he has been covering
the Rose Stagg disappearance.

07:22.120 --> 07:26.728
We have some CCTV footage
that you may not have seen of Rose shopping.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.120
This is her last known appearance in public.

07:34.560 --> 07:39.122
All the evidence thus far suggests that Rose
was abducted from her home by an individual

07:39.280 --> 07:45.128
who, in conversation with Rose's daughter
Nancy, aged six, called himself Peter,

07:45.440 --> 07:49.411
Now on that point...
we have the suspects birth certificate.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.370
Peter Paul Spector.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.251
Mary. John Paul Spector.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.611
Note the occupation. Private, British Army.

08:01.400 --> 08:05.485
He began an 18-month tour of duty here
in March 1978

08:05.640 --> 08:08.689
with the Duke of Cumbria's Regiment,
Third Battalion.

08:08.840 --> 08:12.367
Now Spector was born, as you can see,
on the 25th of May, 1979.

08:12.520 --> 08:16.445
The year the Shankill Butchers were sentenced
to life imprisonment for 19 murders,

08:16.600 --> 08:18.921
the year of Warrenpoint.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.082
A bad year.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.084
Spector's a married man. Married in 2004.

08:25.240 --> 08:30.371
- Sally Ann Goodall.
- Olivia, eight, and Liam, five.

08:31.320 --> 08:36.042
Sally Ann's a senior staff nurse
in the Belfast neo-natal intensive care unit.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.409
She leads a team
that has responsibility for 30 beds.

08:39.600 --> 08:44.003
We have Sally Ann under surveillance
in the hope that shell lead us to her husband.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.811
Our priority is to find him.

08:47.280 --> 08:51.604
<i>Find him, put him under surveillance,
in the hope that he will lead us to Rose.</i>

08:57.800 --> 09:01.566
<i>We know next to nothing
about Paul Spector's childhood.</i>

09:02.120 --> 09:06.011
All we have is a list of children's homes
that he himself provided.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.288
All of those need to be checked out.

09:09.200 --> 09:13.569
A man doesn't wake up one morning and find
that he has become a sexual psychopath.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.327
Nor does he wake up one day
and discover that the condition has gone.

09:17.480 --> 09:20.245
It develops over a very long period of time-.

09:21.920 --> 09:25.402
<i>We need to find out everything
that we possibly can about Paul Spector.</i>

09:27.440 --> 09:30.603
<i>Every detail of his life needs to be established,</i>

09:30.760 --> 09:32.762
<i>checked and double-checked.</i>

09:34.840 --> 09:39.801
I also believe that Paul Spector is responsible
for the deaths of Fiona Gallagher,

09:39.960 --> 09:42.201
Alice Monroe and Sarah Kay.

09:43.400 --> 09:48.042
I'd say all of his previous victims were dead
within an hour of being attacked-.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.487
So she's lost to us already?

09:50.640 --> 09:54.406
The one glimmer of hope is that he knows Rose.

09:55.040 --> 09:59.568
Not from watching and stalking, objectifying her.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.442
He really knows her.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.324
And she's a mother.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.684
<i>I feel sorry for you. I really do.</i>

10:11.400 --> 10:14.802
<i>You must have had a terrible childhood
to be able to do this to me.</i>

10:16.920 --> 10:20.606
<i>I feel sorry for you. I really do.</i>

10:22.400 --> 10:24.402
<i>I feel sorry for you.</i>

10:28.760 --> 10:32.560
Pay a follow-up call to Sally Ann Spector.
Make it seem routine.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.203
Ask her to account for the night she was at work

10:35.360 --> 10:38.204
and Spector told us
that he was at home alone with the kids.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.170
- The night of the Joe Brawley murder?
- Just that night, though.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.721
- Don't spook her too much.
- So just a little?

10:43.880 --> 10:45.928
Take McNally.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.050
Thank you, ma'am.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.483
She wants me for herself, really.
Shes just being generous.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.202
Do you carry that stuff about bombs
and shootings around in your head?

11:10.360 --> 11:12.408
Etched on my soul.

11:26.840 --> 11:30.765
Xray 1 to Control. That's a CID car
pulling up at the target's address.

11:31.160 --> 11:35.210
<i>from Xray 1.
CID car pulling up at target's address.</i>

11:38.200 --> 11:41.010
That's two CID officers at the target's door.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.441
Female at the door, possibly the target's wife.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.207
Two CID officers enter the house.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.326
Door's closed.

12:04.640 --> 12:08.725
I don't know if you remember me, Mrs Spector.
I spoke to you on the phone a while ago.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.564
Yes, I do remember.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.530
I'm sorry to intrude like this,
but there are a few questions

12:13.680 --> 12:16.570
I should have asked you
about the night of the 20th.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.610
- What questions?
- Oh, they're just routine.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.366
I should have asked you at the time.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.531
You were working you said?

12:25.680 --> 12:29.366
Er...I wasn't meant to be working that night,
I'd been on all day.

12:29.520 --> 12:31.887
But we'd withdrawn care
from one of the babies in the unit,

12:32.040 --> 12:34.042
so I stayed with the mother to see it through.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.726
And Paul was at home with the children?

12:36.880 --> 12:41.568
He told my colleague that he was at home
all evening and all night with the children.

12:43.800 --> 12:47.168
"Bathed them, put them to bed,
read them a story.“

12:48.160 --> 12:51.528
He said that after that
he was in his study listening to music.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.088
I'm not sure...

12:57.240 --> 12:59.049
It's OK, Mrs Spector,

12:59.200 --> 13:03.046
we just wanna be able to eliminate
your husband from our enquiries and move on.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.202
Just tell us what you know.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.410
A friend of mine...

13:15.560 --> 13:19.121
A friend of mine
picked up the children from school.

13:19.280 --> 13:23.171
She was looking after them until nine.
She couldn't stay any longer.

13:24.440 --> 13:28.365
So when I couldn't get hold of Paul,
I called our usual baby-sitter.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.362
She came and stayed the night.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.603
She was gone
when I got back the following morning.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.322
Paul was here.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.887
Can I get those names from you, Sally?

13:41.400 --> 13:43.402
The friend? The baby-sitter?

14:45.960 --> 14:47.962
- Talk to you, ma'am?
- Yeah.

14:48.880 --> 14:53.329
According to Mrs Spector, a baby-sitter -
Katarina Benedetto - known as Katie -

14:53.480 --> 14:58.646
was at the Spectors' house on the night of
the Joe Brawley murder, not Spector himself.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.524
- How old?
- 15 at the time, just turned 16.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.362
School student.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.088
Should we talk to her?

15:08.240 --> 15:10.561
Well, she'll need one of her parents present.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.087
Father's dead,
motorcycle accident three years ago.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.242
He was an art dealer.

15:15.480 --> 15:20.202
Mother works for an auction house.
paintings and stuff.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.722
I know what fine art is.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.402
Pay her a visit.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.169
- Mrs Benedetto?
- Yes.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.368
DC Martin, DC McNally.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.443
We'd like to talk to your daughter Katarina.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.604
- Is she home?
- Yes, she is. Come on through.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.762
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.761
Katie? Katie!

16:14.840 --> 16:17.161
These police officers want to talk to you.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.970
When did you first start baby-sitting
for the Spectors, Katie?

16:23.120 --> 16:24.804
When I was 14.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.566
And you were baby-sitting
on the night of the 20th?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.722
- And you stayed all night?
- No.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.490
- No?
- I left at about three in the morning.

16:33.640 --> 16:36.644
- Really?
- You were asleep and didn't hear me come in.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.563
Did you leave because Mr Spector came home?

16:39.720 --> 16:45.204
No. I left because we suddenly realised the time
and he wanted to go to bed.

16:45.360 --> 16:48.523
- We?
- Paul came home at about 9:30.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.562
- 9:30?
- Yes.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.803
I see. Then why did you stay?

16:57.200 --> 16:59.851
We got talking, listening to music in his study.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.606
So you were alone with Mr Spector
from 9:30 till 3am?

17:04.760 --> 17:06.569
The children were there'

17:06.720 --> 17:09.087
Have you stayed that late
at the Spectors' before?

17:09.240 --> 17:11.242
No.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.491
Where did Sally Ann suggest
you should sleep that night?

17:14.640 --> 17:17.450
- She said to use their bed.
- Did you use their bed?

17:18.319 --> 17:19.970
I told you, Paul came home.

17:21.200 --> 17:25.204
- Where had he been?
- Doing something related to work, I think.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.362
Helping one of his clients-.

17:28.040 --> 17:31.647
There was nothing unusual
about his appearance, his demeanour?

17:32.440 --> 17:33.566
No, nothing.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.850
So, just to be clear, you were with
Paul Spector from 9:30 that night,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.923
till after three the following morning?

17:40.080 --> 17:41.684
Yes.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.041
- How did you get home?
- Paul wanted to call a cab but I walked.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.964
- It's not far.
- No, it's not.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.329
We have Tom Stagg's house
under surveillance.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.641
He was visited there last night
by Professor Reed Smith.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.724
Really? How long did she stay?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.882
Two hours.

18:12.320 --> 18:16.370
There were some prolonged silences.
They seemed quite comfortable with each other.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.602
I see.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.128
- Yes?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

18:55.280 --> 18:57.442
I'm shopping for clothes, thank you very much.

18:57.600 --> 19:01.446
<i>- The police have just been here.</i>
- Really?

19:02.240 --> 19:04.766
Asking about the night
that I was baby-sitting for you.

19:04.920 --> 19:05.967
What?

19:06.120 --> 19:08.122
If you wanna know what I said
you'd better meet me.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.489
Katie. Katie, I need to talk to you.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.642
I'm on the phone!

19:16.080 --> 19:17.366
Are you fucking with me?

19:17.520 --> 19:20.922
DC Glen Martin
and DC Something or other McNally.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.046
Meet me at nine.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.531
<i>Cathedral Quarter.</i>

19:25.680 --> 19:27.489
whereabouts?

19:27.640 --> 19:29.642
I'll text you.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.890
- We've just seen the baby-sitter, ma'am.
- How did it go?

19:35.040 --> 19:40.843
She says Spector was at home on the 20th -
his home - with her, from 9:30 in the evening.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.926
- What?
- Says she left at 3am.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.488
So now he has an alibi?

19:47.640 --> 19:49.927
She gave us the time
and the route of her journey home.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.321
We can see if we can find anyone
to confirm her story.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.927
What the fuck is she playing at?
Why would she say that?

19:56.080 --> 19:58.128
One thing she did reveal.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.282
The night before Sarah Kay was killed,

20:00.440 --> 20:06.049
she was baby-sitting while the Spectors were
drinking with friends in the bar of the Malmaison.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.925
Right?

20:09.080 --> 20:11.082
As was...

20:12.560 --> 20:14.562
...Annie Brawley.

20:43.680 --> 20:48.083
<i>We are here today to appeal for
the public's help in locating a missing woman,</i>

20:48.240 --> 20:50.288
<i>Rose Veronica Stagg.</i>

20:51.240 --> 20:54.210
Rose hasn't been seen,
nor has she contacted her family,

20:54.360 --> 20:57.921
since the night of the 3rd of May
and we are concerned for her welfare.

21:00.040 --> 21:06.047
Rose is 32 years old with dark shoulder-length
hair which can appear black when wet.

21:07.200 --> 21:11.250
She can be seen here in a family video
that was shot just three weeks ago.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.167
Ma'am.

21:20.120 --> 21:23.567
<i>I think mine's definitely better
than yours though.</i>

21:23.720 --> 21:25.927
<i>You've got two. I've got one, two, three, four.</i>

21:32.080 --> 21:36.210
<i>I 'm making this one for you, Tom.
I think it's gonna suit you beautifully</i>

21:40.200 --> 21:42.202
<i>Nancy, you gonna make one for Brody?</i>

21:45.600 --> 21:47.682
<i>What do you think of my work?</i>

21:47.840 --> 21:50.366
<i>Rose's car
has also gone missing.</i>

21:51.200 --> 21:54.204
<i>Details of the vehicle
will appear on screen shortly.</i>

21:54.520 --> 21:57.729
<i>This is Roads husband Tom, here beside me.</i>

21:58.560 --> 22:00.403
<i>Tom would like to say a few words.</i>

22:02.120 --> 22:04.202
<i>Thank you so much for watching today.</i>

22:05.280 --> 22:06.691
<i>I'm appealing to anyone</i>

22:06.840 --> 22:08.251
<i>who might have any information</i>

22:08.400 --> 22:11.085
<i>about the disappearance of my wife Rose,</i>

22:11.240 --> 22:14.767
<i>to contact the police anytime day or night.</i>

22:17.240 --> 22:20.050
<i>Rose is a therapeutic radiologist by profession.</i>

22:21.680 --> 22:25.651
<i>Many of her patients are suffering from
advanced forms of cancer.</i>

22:25.920 --> 22:27.604
<i>It would be completely out of character</i>

22:27.760 --> 22:30.286
<i>for Rose to leave those patients in the lurch.</i>

22:33.080 --> 22:35.242
I know she would call me if she could...

22:36.560 --> 22:40.770
...which makes me think she might be
being held somewhere against her will.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.291
I know she's alive...

22:52.480 --> 22:53.811
She can't...

23:18.880 --> 23:20.882
Ma'am.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.845
We have tyre tracks, ma'am.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.686
They match the track width
and the wheelbase of Rose Stagg's car.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.884
- Any sign of the phone?
- Not yet. We're losing light.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.727
Fuck you, Stella. Fuck you.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.728
Fucking bitch.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.603
Xray 1 to Control. Standby.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.162
<i>Target's wife out of the house with two children.</i>

25:04.320 --> 25:08.882
<i>Uniform, Echo, Zulu, 8243.</i>

25:09.680 --> 25:11.170
<i>Vehicle facing country-wards.</i>

25:11.320 --> 25:15.041
All call signs standby.
Target's wife and two children in green Volvo.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.202
<i>Alpha, do you have target vehicle?</i>

25:17.840 --> 25:19.842
Alpha. I have.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.402
<i>Control. Alpha has.</i>

25:29.240 --> 25:31.891
- Anything?
- There's no sign of the car, ma'am.

25:32.680 --> 25:35.729
There is no such number.
Did you get a make or a model?

25:37.040 --> 25:39.646
Check on the PNC for recently stolen vehicles.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.802
- Gibson.
<i>- Hi. It's Reed Smith.</i>

25:48.680 --> 25:51.570
- Hi.
<i>- Can I see you?</i>

25:53.000 --> 25:55.002
- When?
<i>- Tonight?</i>

25:56.760 --> 25:59.047
- ls ten too late?
- No. It's fine.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.765
<i>- Where? </i>
- Bert's bar.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.441
<i>Perfect. I'll see you there.</i>

26:06.080 --> 26:08.082
Ma'am.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.962
- Stolen this morning.
- Right.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.771
That's it.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.801
Where was it stolen from?

26:39.600 --> 26:41.602
From here, ma'am.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.001
Ma'am. We've found something.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.327
It's not the phone. It's a phone case.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.205
I'm joining someone.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.362
She's there.

27:24.040 --> 27:28.602
I don't have much time. Tell me what happened.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.489
The thing is,
I really did walk home alone at three.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.290
I gave them the exact route.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.922
There were people who saw me,
there's CCTV along the way.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.367
So if they check up they'll see it's true-.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.802
Are you pleased with me?

28:30.360 --> 28:33.569
- Not particularly.
- Why are you being like this?

28:34.520 --> 28:36.921
- Like what?
- I'm protecting you.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.724
- I don't need your protection-
- Yes, you do.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.331
- And now you have to tell me.
- Tell you?

28:47.160 --> 28:48.969
The truth about you.

28:49.120 --> 28:52.124
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

29:00.400 --> 29:06.282
Being a serial murderer is a form
of slow suicide, deeply self-destructive.

29:07.320 --> 29:10.642
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Katie,
but...that's not my style.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.322
Then what are you? Who are you?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.002
I'm lots of things.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.801
- So am I.
- You?

29:24.200 --> 29:27.329
You're a stereotype, The rebellious teenager.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.321
I'm much more than that.

29:30.480 --> 29:34.485
- Do you ever find yourself a day behind?
- What do you mean?

29:34.640 --> 29:37.041
Or look at the clock
and see that hours have gone by

29:37.200 --> 29:39.362
and you have no idea what you were doing?

29:39.520 --> 29:41.522
I don't know.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.967
- Are you always just little Katie?
- No.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.561
- When aren't you little Katie?
- When I'm with you.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.886
I've pretended to be other people online.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.602
Who?

29:57.200 --> 29:58.770
Different names.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.207
Older. A guy.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.961
- Then maybe you will understand.
- Try me.

30:31.480 --> 30:35.041
I hadn't taken much notice of the case,
the various murders.

30:36.120 --> 30:41.331
But then one evening we were driving home
from a meeting with one of Olivia's teachers,

30:41.480 --> 30:44.051
and we were diverted away
from a crime scene.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.965
I went home and looked up the news
to see what happened.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.521
There'd been a murder - Sarah Kay.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.367
- You know I go running?
- Yes.

30:54.040 --> 30:56.646
Well, sometimes I run through the city.

30:56.800 --> 31:00.486
But sometimes I run through
the Botanic Gardens and I head south.

31:01.400 --> 31:04.404
When Hake that route
I run through the graveyard.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.848
A couple of days after the murder,
the police had reopened the street.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.490
I went that way.

31:09.640 --> 31:13.725
And running along the path through
the gravestones something caught my eye.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.762
It was a driver's licence.

31:17.240 --> 31:20.687
So I stopped, picked it up,
and it was Sarah Kay's.

31:23.440 --> 31:27.240
I looked at the address.
I saw that she lived opposite the cemetery.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.368
So then I began to wonder.

31:30.520 --> 31:34.366
Had she dropped it,
or had the killer discarded it?

31:35.600 --> 31:37.967
Had the killer passed that way?

31:39.320 --> 31:40.401
Oh, my God.

31:40.560 --> 31:45.964
So there I am, holding this driving licence
and I'm thinking, "I should go to the police."

31:47.160 --> 31:50.562
- And then I found I didn't want to.
- Why?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.844
- Did you see the first press conference?
- No.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.245
- The one for Sarah Kay?
- No.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.571
Well, there's this woman. An Englishwoman.

32:03.520 --> 32:07.366
And it seemed that she was the one that linked
the murders and that she was in charge.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.841
That's her.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.891
What I noticed, at the conference, her blouse...

32:30.560 --> 32:34.485
silk blouse...was open...here.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.282
Gaping open.

32:40.400 --> 32:45.042
And she seemed so cool,
so relaxed, so self-assured.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.163
Superior.

32:48.320 --> 32:52.803
While the Irishman sat next to her
looked like a potato, a farmer.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.681
Like a dope.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.491
And I thought, “Fuck you, you English bitch."

33:01.200 --> 33:03.931
So I kept it, didn't hand it in.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.966
Which is maybe just as well,
given that you were in the park

33:09.120 --> 33:11.202
at the same time as her and her sister.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.920
The more I thought about that woman,
Stella Gibson...

33:18.000 --> 33:20.810
"the more I wanted to fuck with her
and her investigation.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.083
So I wrote a letter pretending to be the killer.

33:26.960 --> 33:30.851
And to prove that I was the killer
I enclosed the driver's licence.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.289
You did that?

33:34.440 --> 33:37.603
And they bought it hook, line and sinker.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.648
Are you still messing with her?

33:59.000 --> 34:01.048
I have one more thing I want to do.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.567
- Tell me.
- No.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.087
Let me do it with you. Please.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.167
- You're not ready.
- I am.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.560
I'm ready for anything.

34:12.719 --> 34:15.121
You think I'm a little gin, but I'm not.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.206
Ask me to do anything and I will.

34:31.800 --> 34:36.362
Create a fake email account.
Use it to create a video chat account.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.887
Text me the details using that phone.

34:39.400 --> 34:43.371
- That's it?
- No, there's a lot more to do than that.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.722
Hey.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.682
I wanted to say that I was sorry.

38:10.800 --> 38:14.521
Questioning you about the scratches.
I...I didn't need to do that.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.641
You were just doing your job.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.802
Oh, it was more than that. I was...

38:22.640 --> 38:24.642
I don't know, prying.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.362
It's OK.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.807
I saw Tom on the television.

39:29.720 --> 39:32.121
- Yeah.
- He did well.

39:34.120 --> 39:36.487
I helped him choose the video clips of Rose.

39:37.680 --> 39:41.321
I didn't realise
that you were so close to the family.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.042
- What do you mean?
- To Tom.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.764
I'm told you seem quite comfortable
in his company.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.802
Am I being watched?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.526
- No.
- But Tom is?

40:04.120 --> 40:05.645
Are the police spying on him?

40:05.800 --> 40:09.964
You know as well as I do that the first person
the police look at in a case like this

40:10.120 --> 40:12.122
is the boyfriend or the husband.

40:13.160 --> 40:16.482
- He's not responsible for Rose going missing.
- No, I know.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.602
We are.

40:57.040 --> 41:01.682
Xray 1. Standby. Unknown
approaching target address. Hood up.

41:01.840 --> 41:05.401
<i>from Xray 1. Standby.
Unknown approaching target address. Hood up.</i>

41:05.560 --> 41:06.971
<i>Is it a possible for target?</i>

41:07.120 --> 41:11.011
unable to say, dark clothes.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.924
Maybe smaller than target's height.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.691
Moving towards the alleyway
at side of target's house.

41:19.840 --> 41:23.731
<i>- Control. Delta move closer to drop off 2.
- OK</i>

41:24.040 --> 41:26.930
<i>- 2, give me a walk past.
- Copy.</i>

41:58.960 --> 42:02.328
From 2.
Unknown climbing over rear wall. Wait. Out.

42:09.280 --> 42:10.805
Entering through rear door.

42:27.680 --> 42:30.160
Oh, I should take this. Sorry.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.962
Gibson.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.802
Yes, go ahead.

43:42.160 --> 43:45.562
<i>all signs standby.
Unknown leaving target address.</i>

43:45.720 --> 43:46.801
Follow.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.561
<i>- Target's now on Newtown Road, ma'am.</i>
- Where's that?

44:01.720 --> 44:03.722
<i>- University Quarter.</i>
- Right.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.648
From 3. Target is female.

44:12.800 --> 44:16.407
<i>16, 17 years old. Entering Edson Avenue.</i>

44:31.000 --> 44:33.082
From 5, I now have...

44:35.520 --> 44:37.841
<i>- Hello, ma'am?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.800
<i>Target went into a house on Edson Avenue.
Number 16.</i>

44:41.960 --> 44:44.486
<i>We are trying to ascertain who resides there.</i>

44:44.800 --> 44:46.802
I know that address.

44:48.640 --> 44:51.450
That sounds like it could be the Benedetto girl.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.802
Katie.

44:57.480 --> 45:00.927
I'm sorry. I couldn't help but notice
you sitting over here all by yourself.

45:01.080 --> 45:02.730
I wasn't sure what you were drinking.

45:02.880 --> 45:05.645
But a good margarita
is always acceptable, I think.

45:07.160 --> 45:09.561
I'm Michael Day. Bacon and Day Solicitors?

45:11.280 --> 45:13.089
How lovely for you.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.049
- What do you do?
- I'm a pathologist.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.927
From the Ancient Greek "pathos"
meaning "disease"

45:21.080 --> 45:23.287
and “logos" meaning "a treatise".

45:23.440 --> 45:25.841
I study disease. Death being the final disease.

45:27.840 --> 45:30.446
So now I'm thinking you must be
Professor Reed Smith.

45:31.480 --> 45:34.370
beauty and brains.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.802
Sorry I'm late.

45:40.200 --> 45:42.009
It's nice to see you.

45:42.160 --> 45:44.162
It's nice to see you too.

45:52.600 --> 45:56.161
Thanks. Keep them coming.

45:58.560 --> 46:01.530
I'm er...I'm not the waiter.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.762
Well, why are you standing there?

46:10.040 --> 46:12.520
- That was nice.
- Yes, it was.

46:14.800 --> 46:18.043
He knows who I am.
I dare say he knows who you are.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.802
So what?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.002
Oh, God, what am I doing?

46:45.400 --> 46:47.402
Going with the flow.

46:49.800 --> 46:52.007
I can't.

46:53.960 --> 46:57.169
I can't I... I was brought up in Croydon.

46:58.200 --> 47:00.202
What's that supposed to mean?

47:01.200 --> 47:05.444
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

47:16.280 --> 47:18.282
(Message alert}

47:31.400 --> 47:33.402
<i>Lift going down.</i>

48:34.800 --> 48:36.609
Oh.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.322
- Jim.
- Stella.

48:46.600 --> 48:48.125
Can I come in?

48:48.280 --> 48:50.567
Five minutes.

48:51.400 --> 48:53.926
- Why?
- Five minutes, please.

48:59.800 --> 49:03.521
- How did you know I was here?
- Why wouldn’t you be here?

49:05.640 --> 49:08.291
- Have you been drinking?
- I have indeed.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.446
- Do you have ice?
- No.

49:16.600 --> 49:18.841
- How many years has it been?
- What?

49:19.480 --> 49:21.244
Er...

49:21.400 --> 49:23.402
Oh...

49:24.400 --> 49:28.246
Five years...this Christmas.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.288
Shouldn't you be phoning your sponsor?

49:38.280 --> 49:40.487
I just had a call from Eastwood.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.082
Aaron Monroe is back in custody.

49:45.600 --> 49:48.410
Made an attempt to kill his father in hospital.

49:48.560 --> 49:50.562
- His own father.
- Really?

49:51.720 --> 49:57.648
It was me who tipped off Morgan
that Eastwood had warrants out for his son.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.604
Jim, I don't need to know this.

49:59.760 --> 50:02.570
I was trying to out-manoeuvre Monroe Senior

50:02.720 --> 50:05.690
to make his position
on the Policing Executive untenable.

50:06.840 --> 50:12.768
If Aaron knows and tells Eastwood that it
was me who tipped the father off, I'm finished.

50:19.760 --> 50:22.331
You know what he said to me? Eastwood?

50:23.720 --> 50:26.564
He called me a weak man.

50:26.720 --> 50:30.247
Can you believe that? "A weak man."

50:40.400 --> 50:42.402
I have been weak.

50:45.640 --> 50:47.642
I am weak.

50:53.400 --> 50:55.402
Oh, Stella.

51:01.800 --> 51:03.450
I want you so badly.

51:03.600 --> 51:06.080
Don't Jim, seriously, don't.

51:06.600 --> 51:08.443
- Please, Stella...
- No.

51:08.600 --> 51:10.443
Just one night. Just one night.

51:10.600 --> 51:13.524
I need to forget the shit, all the shit I've seen...

51:13.680 --> 51:15.364
- No.
- Oh, please. Please.

51:15.520 --> 51:17.010
- Come on. Jim.
- Please. Please.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.242
- Stop.
- Please, please!

51:19.400 --> 51:21.368
- Please. Please, Please, Stella!
- Jim!

51:22.880 --> 51:24.166
For fucks sake!

51:41.920 --> 51:46.005
Today at the briefing I saw a list of the
children's homes that Spector says he attended.

51:47.800 --> 51:51.646
One of those homes,
I got to know... I got to know very well.

51:53.720 --> 51:56.087
Run by a paedophile.

51:56.240 --> 52:00.723
Father Fiachra Jensen.
A man of my faith, Stella.

52:01.320 --> 52:03.322
Keep still.

52:03.640 --> 52:08.851
A man in a position of power,
wielding moral authority.

52:10.480 --> 52:12.448
His idea of midnight Mass?

52:12.600 --> 52:19.006
Soixante-neuf with an altar boy behind
the altar in full vestments - unholy orders.

52:21.200 --> 52:23.202
What a fall from grace.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.002
I was the arresting officer.

52:32.120 --> 52:33.485
Decades later...

52:33.640 --> 52:35.608
the lives of the victims...

52:36.560 --> 52:41.407
...blighted by depression and addiction,
broken marriages...

52:42.080 --> 52:44.481
self-harm, suicide.

52:46.400 --> 52:50.200
Maybe this-..murderous fuck is a victim too?

52:51.800 --> 52:53.802
Maybe.

53:03.600 --> 53:07.605
Why are women emotionally and spiritually
so much stronger than men?

53:11.200 --> 53:13.806
Because the basic human form is female.

53:16.440 --> 53:21.287
Maleness is...a kind of birth defect.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.282
- Stella.
- Hm.

53:29.440 --> 53:35.129
You look at me like you looked at that bottle
a mixture of fear and anger.

53:37.400 --> 53:39.402
I don’t like it.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.802
<i>Have you had a good evening?</i>

55:30.360 --> 55:32.806
Yes, thanks. You?

55:34.400 --> 55:36.402
It's been fun.

55:40.120 --> 55:42.361
How did it feel, breaking in?

55:44.200 --> 55:46.282
<i>Thrilling.</i>

55:48.400 --> 55:50.050
<i>What's my reward?</i>

55:50.520 --> 55:52.522
What would you like?

55:56.400 --> 55:58.368
What are you wearing?

56:00.400 --> 56:02.368
Nothing.

56:05.680 --> 56:07.728
Prove it.

57:19.760 --> 57:22.331
<i>"Oh, Stella, how revealing.</i>

57:22.480 --> 57:24.482
<i>How exposing.</i>

57:24.880 --> 57:27.247
<i>It's all in these pages.</i>

57:27.400 --> 57:31.121
<i>Sweet little Stella missing her daddy,
lost and alone.</i>

57:32.000 --> 57:36.085
<i>Sexy Stella,
expressing her deepest, darkest desires.</i>

57:36.800 --> 57:42.284
<i>Stroppy Stella, angry and misunderstood,
lashing out against the world of men.</i>

57:43.360 --> 57:47.081
<i>Oh, Stella Gibson, how well I know you now"</i>
