I DON'T SEE WHY
METAPHORICAL PUSHING

06:44.538 --> 06:46.474
HAS TO INVOLVE
ACTUAL PUSHING.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.176
I MAY WORK THESE KIDS HARD,
BUT I NEVER HIT THEM.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.879

INSTEAD OF KNOCKING THEM THERE.

A SYMPTOM WHICH WE LEARNED ABOUT
WHEN HE CHOKED ME.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.319
HATE TO SLOW US DOWN
BY ACKNOWLEDGING IT.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.854
AND YET YOU HAVE.

MENTIONED IT.

ABOUT IT.

09:58.966 --> 09:59.933
WEDDINGS ARE GOOD
FOR THAT.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.669
I WAS HOPING
TO GET IN TOUCH.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.704
THE THING IS, I'M
A BIT FUZZY ON NAMES.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.373
SORRY.
OPEN BAR.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.241
SHE WAS SITTING
AT DR. SIMPSON'S TABLE.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.711
BRUNETTE, PURPLE DRESS,
LOW-CUT.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.780
THAT'S MY NIECE,
WINN PHILLIPS.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.248
YOUR NIECE?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.751
FANTASTIC.

10:17.785 --> 10:21.188
HER INFO IS
IN YOUR EMAIL.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.893
ALSO, THERE WAS A BLONDE.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.796
GREEN DRESS.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.798
YOU WANT ME TO HOOK YOU UP
WITH TWO WOMEN?

10:30.831 --> 10:33.233
ACTUALLY, THREE.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.737
[door opens]

10:36.770 --> 10:38.405
HOW DO YOU CHEAT
ON A TEST

10:38.438 --> 10:40.440
WHEN THERE'S NO TEST?

10:40.473 --> 10:43.410
SORRY, NOT PLAYING.

10:43.443 --> 10:47.848
GO AWAY, HOUSE.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.116
I AM NOT
GIVING YOU ADVICE

10:49.149 --> 10:50.684
JUST SO YOU CAN
DISTORT IT

10:50.718 --> 10:52.986
TO SUIT YOUR OWN
WARPED WORLD VIEW.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.888
BUT IT'S BEEN WORKING
SO WELL.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.891
CUDDY WANTS TO GET RACHEL
INTO WALDENWOOD PRESCHOOL.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.260
THE PROBLEM IS, RACHEL'S
DUMBER THAN A PASTE SANDWICH.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.262
AND HER NOT GETTING IN
BOTHERS YOU.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.733
YOU CARE ABOUT RACHEL.
THAT WAS NOT ADVICE.

11:05.766 --> 11:06.734
CUDDY CARES ABOUT HER.

11:06.767 --> 11:10.070
WHEN RACHEL GETS REJECTED,
CUDDY WILL BE UPSET.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.939
AND AS THE BOYFRIEND,
I WILL BE EXPECTED

11:11.972 --> 11:13.941
TO BE SUPPORTIVE
AND CONSOLING.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.209
NOT YOUR STRENGTHS,
I GRANT YOU.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.811
LEAVE IT ALONE.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.346
IT'S JUST A PLAY DATE.
IT'LL BE FINE.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.081
PLAY DATE BEING
THEIR CODE FOR

11:21.114 --> 11:23.250
WAY TO WEED OUT
THE PASTE SANDWICHES.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.318
THEY'LL HAND HER PUZZLES
AND COUNTING GAMES,

11:25.352 --> 11:31.058
AND RACHEL WILL JUST SIT THERE
AND EAT THE PIECES.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.427
OH, CRAP! CRAP!
I'M SUCH A SUCKER!

11:34.461 --> 11:37.430
THANKS FOR THE ADVICE.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.766
(Masters)
THAT'S THE ISOLATION AREA.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.734
KIDS WHO'VE BEHAVED BADLY
GO THERE,

11:40.768 --> 11:42.770
SOMETIMES 23 HOURS A DAY.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.805
SOUND LIKE A PRETTY GOOD
INCENTIVE TO BEHAVE.

11:44.838 --> 11:48.441
YEAH, BY TREATING THE SYMPTOM
INSTEAD OF THE DISEASE.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.778
BASIC SYSTEMS THEORY.

11:50.811 --> 11:54.047
TROUBLED KIDS ARE PRODUCED
BY TROUBLED FAMILIES.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.049
THIS PLACE DOESN'T EVEN ATTEMPT
TO CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT

11:56.083 --> 11:57.885
THAT DAMAGED THEM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.054
SO THERE ARE NO BAD KIDS,
ONLY BAD PARENTS?

12:01.088 --> 12:02.890
THEN WHY IS MY BROTHER
AN EX-CON?

12:02.923 --> 12:07.995
TREATING KIDS DECENTLY
DOESN'T MEAN IDENTICALLY.

12:08.028 --> 12:13.166
SOME KIDS NEED MORE
STRUCTURE OR DISCIPLINE.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.036
NOBODY NEEDS THIS PLACE.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.272
MAYBE WE'RE COMING
AT THIS WRONG.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.207
WE FIND A POISONER,

12:20.240 --> 12:21.909
AND LET THEM POINT US
TOWARD THE POISON.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.978
DRISCOLL'S GOT 24 KIDS
IN HIS TROOP.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.146
YOU WANT TO INTERVIEW
ALL OF THEM?

12:26.179 --> 12:28.916
MAYBE WE DON'T NEED TO.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.517
DRISCOLL SENT ME
TO ISOLATION ALL THE TIME.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.219
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I POISONED HIM.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.554
HE'S THE PSYCHO,
NOT ME.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.224
TELL 'EM.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.325
D.I. DRISCOLL'S
WAY HARDER ON HIM

12:38.358 --> 12:40.027
THAN THE REST OF US.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.561
MAYBE BECAUSE HE'S
A BIGGER PAIN IN THE ASS.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.230
WHAT ARE YOU IN HERE FOR?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.431
SHOPLIFTING.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.099
YOU READY TO UPGRADE
TO SECOND-DEGREE MURDER?

12:46.133 --> 12:48.101
SPEND TEN YEARS IN JAIL?

12:48.135 --> 12:49.536
IF HE DIES BECAUSE OF
WHATEVER YOU GAVE HIM,

12:49.569 --> 12:50.570
THAT'S WHAT'LL HAPPEN.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.073
THAT SUPPOSED TO
SCARE ME?

12:53.106 --> 12:55.142
MY MOM'S DEAD, MY DAD'S
NEVER BEEN AROUND.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.143
AND AFTER THIS,
I'LL GET BOUNCED

12:56.176 --> 12:57.277
TO ANOTHER FOSTER HOME.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.246
MY FUTURE'S
NOT EXACTLY BRIGHT.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.848
PRISON NOW OR LATER
DOESN'T MAKE THAT MUCH

13:00.881 --> 13:01.915
OF A DIFFERENCE TO ME.

13:01.949 --> 13:06.053
DUDE, I'M NOT MOPPING
THE WHOLE FLOOR BY MYSELF.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.555
YOUR EYES ARE RED.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.825
MIGHT BE AN ALLERGIC REACTION
TO THE CLEANING SOLUTION.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.160
IT'S JUST MY ALLERGIES.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.261
DO YOU TAKE ANYTHING
FOR THEM?

13:14.294 --> 13:17.030
NOT RIGHT NOW.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.531
WHY NOT?

13:26.073 --> 13:28.141
THESE IV FLUIDS WILL HELP

13:28.175 --> 13:30.077
FLUSH THE DRUGS
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.913
YOU KNOW WHICH
OF THE KIDS DOSED ME?

13:32.946 --> 13:35.182
IT'S NOT MEDICALLY
RELEVANT.

13:35.215 --> 13:38.018
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA HURT HIM.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.153
BUT I GET WHY
YOU'RE SCARED OF ME.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.123
I'M REAL SORRY
ABOUT THIS MORNING.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.026
NO APOLOGY NECESSARY.
YOU'RE ILL.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.061
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.632
I USED TO BE
A REAL SCREWUP.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.202
THE MILITARY TAUGHT ME
THAT ACTIONS

13:55.235 --> 13:56.603
ALWAYS HAVE CONSEQUENCES.

13:56.636 --> 14:01.141
PART OF BEING A MAN IS
ACCEPTING THEM.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.176
AND AFTER ALL THE TIMES
I'VE SAID THAT TO THE KIDS,

14:03.210 --> 14:06.113
AN APOLOGY IS NECESSARY.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.152
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.420
MY HEART'S KINDA RACING.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.056
I GOT IT.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.461
HEART RATE IS 170.
P.A.T. UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE,

14:21.494 --> 14:22.996
WE'VE GOTTA SLOW IT DOWN.
SIX MILLIGRAMS

14:23.030 --> 14:23.997
ADENOSINE, IV BOLUS.

14:24.031 --> 14:24.998
TELL THE NURSE TO GET IN HERE

14:25.032 --> 14:27.100
WITH THE CRASH CART.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.140
PUSHING FLUID SENT HIS HEART
INTO OVERDRIVE.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.374
IT TOOK THREE DOSES
OF ADENOSINE

14:34.407 --> 14:36.009
TO GET IT UNDER CONTROL.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.444
(House)
TREATING HIM FOR
ANTIHISTAMINE TOXICITY

14:37.477 --> 14:39.012
REVEALED A NEW SYMPTOM,
[cell phone vibrates]

14:39.046 --> 14:40.047
WHICH REVEALED THAT
HE DIDN'T HAVE

14:40.080 --> 14:41.982
ANTIHISTAMINE TOXICITY
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.150
HOUSE, WHERE ARE YOU?

14:43.183 --> 14:46.219
PLAYGROUND.
GREAT PLACE TO MEET CHICKS.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.454
THEIR MOMS TOO.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.289
TACHYCARDIA COULD BE
A HUMORAL EFFECT--

14:49.322 --> 14:50.457
MASTOCYTOSIS.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.558
(Masters)
WE'D SEE OTHER GI

14:51.591 --> 14:53.126
OR CUTANEOUS SYMPTOMS.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.928
PANCREATIC INSULINOMA.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.063
IT WOULD CAUSE
BLADDER PROBLEMS,

14:56.096 --> 14:57.998
UNLIKE PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.699
WELL DONE, CHASE.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.968
NOW, TURN OFF YOUR PHONE.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.269
YOU HEARD THAT?
IT'S ON VIBRATE.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.104
(House)
I'M ASSUMING IT'S BEEN RINGING

15:04.137 --> 15:06.706
ALMOST NONSTOP SINCE YOU
CHANGED YOUR STATUS UPDATE

15:06.739 --> 15:08.308
TO "NOTHING LIGHTS MY FIRE

15:08.341 --> 15:09.943
"LIKE A LADY OF SIZE--

15:09.977 --> 15:12.079
LESS THAN THREE BILLS,
DON'T BOTHER CALLING."

15:12.112 --> 15:13.947
FOLLOWED BY YOUR CELL NUMBER.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.984
[laughter]

15:18.618 --> 15:19.486
NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.989
THIS IS IN NO WAY CLEVER
AND HYSTERICAL.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.590
(House)
BEFORE YOU START ROLLING
ANYONE IN FLOUR,

15:23.623 --> 15:25.292
WORK THE PATIENT OUT
FOR A PHEO.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.962
ADRENALINE PITUITARY SCANS,
24-HOUR URINE COLLECTION.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.634
HOW SOON AFTER
THE ADMISSIONS SESSION

15:34.667 --> 15:35.602
DID THE CHILD GET SICK?

15:35.635 --> 15:38.138
THE KID BARELY GOT HOME
BEFORE SHE COLLAPSED.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.740
HER PARENTS ARE A WRECK.
DESPERATE FOR ANSWERS.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.043
HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED
ANY SYMPTOMS,

15:43.076 --> 15:45.178
OR DOES SOMEONE ELSE
OVERSEE THESE SESSIONS?

15:45.212 --> 15:46.279
THE TEACHERS SUPERVISE.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.747
NO ONE'S MENTIONED
FEELING SICK.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.183
I'D LOVE TO CALL THE FAMILY
AND OFFER MY SUPPORT.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.485
SORRY, I CAN'T
REVEAL NAMES.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.988
DOCTOR-PATIENT
CONFIDENTIALITY.

15:55.022 --> 15:58.091
SO THIS IS WHERE ALL THE
ADMISSIONS PLAY DATES HAPPEN?

15:58.125 --> 15:59.459
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
IN ANOTHER ROOM?

15:59.492 --> 16:01.094
THIS IS WHERE
WE HAVE THEM ALL.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.762
MAYBE, TO BE SAFE,
WE GET RID OF THESE TOYS.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.064
NO, NO, NO,
DON'T DO THAT.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.033
I'LL TELL YOU
IF ANYTHING'S TOXIC.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.068
FOR NOW, YOU SHOULD
MINIMIZE YOUR EXPOSURE.

16:23.550 --> 16:27.087
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
SUPERVISED.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.122
THE SCAN IS PRE-PROGRAMMED.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.223
THERE'S NO RISK
TO THE PATIENT.

16:30.257 --> 16:33.226
YOU'RE LITERALLY GONNA
SIT HERE, WATCH THE MONITOR,

16:33.260 --> 16:34.494
AND CHAT WITH HIM
IF HE GETS LONELY.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.496
UH...STILL.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.166
REPORT ME.

16:49.209 --> 16:53.680
[scanner pulsing]

16:53.713 --> 16:55.182
HOW YOU DOING IN THERE?

16:55.215 --> 16:59.219
YOU SHOULDN'T BOTHER
TRYING TO PROTECT LANDON.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.653
I KNOW HE'S THE ONE
WHO DRUGGED ME.

17:00.687 --> 17:04.191
THE ANTIHISTAMINES AREN'T
WHAT GOT YOU SICK.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.426
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT HE DID IT.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.297
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WITH THAT KID.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.631
I JUST...

17:11.664 --> 17:14.601
CAN'T BREAK THROUGH.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.536
IT'S CLEAR YOU CARE
ABOUT HIM.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.505
HAVE YOU TRIED
TELLING HIM THAT?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.073
YOU GOTTA
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.242
THESE KIDS, THEY'RE ALL
MANIPULATORS.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.676
AS MUCH AS I CARE
ABOUT ALL OF THEM,

17:23.710 --> 17:26.213
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T SHOW THEM THAT

17:26.246 --> 17:28.115
UNLESS THERE'S SOME
MUTUAL RESPECT.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.582
OTHERWISE--
FORGET THOSE OTHER KIDS.

17:29.616 --> 17:33.253
THINK ABOUT THIS KID.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.422
HE WATCHED HIS MOTHER
GET SICK AND DIE.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.091
HE'S NEVER KNOWN
HIS DAD.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.726
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG
IT'S BEEN

17:39.759 --> 17:41.094
SINCE ANYONE'S
TAKEN CARE OF HIM,

17:41.128 --> 17:42.295
OR IF THERE'S EVER
BEEN A MAN AROUND

17:42.329 --> 17:47.334
WITH ANY DEGREE
OF CONSISTENCY?

17:47.367 --> 17:51.638
I BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE ON HIS SIDE.

17:51.671 --> 17:55.808
I'M BETTING IT WOULD HELP
IF HE DID.

18:01.348 --> 18:05.152
YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL MAN.
CAN I LEAVE NOW?

18:05.185 --> 18:07.254
I KNOW WHERE
ALL THREE WOMEN ARE,

18:07.287 --> 18:08.821
BUT I'D LIKE TO AVOID
THE ADDITIONAL HUMILIATION

18:08.855 --> 18:11.291
OF FALSELY ACCUSING
ANY OF THEM.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.359
YOU I.D.ed THE HOTEL
OFF THIS.

18:12.392 --> 18:17.130
I'M HOPING THERE'S ANOTHER CLUE
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.132
WE COULD ENHANCE THE IMAGE.

18:19.166 --> 18:22.135
MAYBE HER FACE
IS REFLECTED

18:22.169 --> 18:24.904
IN THAT GLEAM
OFF YOUR BUTT CHEEK.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.674
OR MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO CHALK THIS UP

18:27.707 --> 18:29.376
TO THE HAZARDS
OF BEING A PLAYER.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.612
YOUR ZIPPER PROBLEMS
JUST BLEW UP YOUR MARRIAGE.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.217
DON'T MOVE.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.851
UNLIKE ME,
YOU'VE HAD THE DECENCY

18:38.885 --> 18:40.687
NOT TO CHEAT ON ANYONE,

18:40.720 --> 18:41.654
BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
GIVING MUCH THOUGHT

18:41.688 --> 18:45.458
TO WHO THESE WOMEN ARE,
HOW THEY MIGHT FEEL.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.427
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU HURT ONE OF THEM.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.395
EMOTIONALLY, YOU HURT HER,

18:48.428 --> 18:51.431
BECAUSE PHYSICALLY,
HOW WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW?

18:53.966 --> 18:57.904
LOOKS LIKE YOUR SHORTY
IS A SHORTY.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.242
[knock on door]

19:04.311 --> 19:06.179
YOU'RE EARLY.
DINNER'S NOT READY.

19:06.213 --> 19:11.184
OH...OKAY.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.452
RACHEL AND I WILL
GO PLAY IN HER ROOM.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.753
REALLY?

19:13.786 --> 19:15.555
I'M HUNGRY. GO COOK.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.576
ALL RIGHT, YOU LITTLE
LUMP OF CLAY...

19:40.280 --> 19:44.251
RACHEL. RACHEL...

19:44.284 --> 19:45.618
IT'S A NEW TOY.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.921
WHAT KID DOESN'T LIKE
NEW TOYS?

19:48.955 --> 19:51.391
A MORON, THAT'S WHO.

19:51.424 --> 19:55.295
OKAY, LOOK AT
THE PRETTY COLORS.

19:55.328 --> 19:58.765
NOW, WHAT COLOR IS THIS?

19:58.798 --> 20:01.234
HMM?

20:01.268 --> 20:04.003
ORANGE.

20:04.036 --> 20:08.541
YES, THAT IS ORANGE.
WHAT COLOR IS THIS?

20:10.877 --> 20:14.847
OKAY, BLOCKS GOING AWAY.
BYE-BYE BLOCKS.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.650
NEXT TIME,
REINFORCE THE LEVEES.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.452
BAD CORPS OF
ARMY ENGINEERS. BAD!

20:19.486 --> 20:21.888
WHAT'S THIS?

20:21.921 --> 20:24.391
[gasps]
RINGS!

20:24.424 --> 20:25.825
LOOK AT THE RINGS.

20:25.858 --> 20:31.864
NOW, THE GOAL
OF THIS GAME IS...

20:33.566 --> 20:35.635
TO NOT KILL YOU.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.540
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

20:40.573 --> 20:43.743
WAIT, DID YOU GIVE ME
AN STD?

20:43.776 --> 20:46.413
NO, I DID NOT.
DON'T DEFLECT.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.515
THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN
BY SOMEONE YOUR HEIGHT.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.650
JUST TAKE IT DOWN.
WHAT PICTURE?

20:50.683 --> 20:55.288
FINE.
PLAY IT THAT WAY.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.468
SO, UH...

21:08.501 --> 21:10.036
YOU REALLY LIKE KITTENS,
HUH?

21:10.069 --> 21:11.938
YEAH. YOU SAID
YOU DID TOO.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.940
NO WONDER YOU'RE PISSED.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.643
'CAUSE THAT IS NOT YOU.
AND I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.312
DID YOU MEAN MY HEIGHT
WITH HEELS OR WITHOUT?

21:19.346 --> 21:22.382
YOU WEREN'T WEARING HEELS
WHEN WE WERE IN THAT ROOM--

21:22.415 --> 21:24.817
OH, YES, YOU WERE.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.019
I STARTED
TO TAKE THEM OFF,

21:27.053 --> 21:29.522
AND THEN YOU ASKED ME
VERY NICELY NOT TO.

21:29.556 --> 21:32.459
WHY WOULD I DO THIS?

21:32.492 --> 21:34.361
I MEAN, I'M NOT MAD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED WITH US.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.629
OR APPARENTLY WITH YOU
AND ANY OTHER WOMAN

21:36.663 --> 21:37.764
AT THAT WEDDING.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.567
SORRY, I GUESS
MY FORENSIC ANALYSIS

21:40.600 --> 21:42.869
WASN'T AS ADVANCED
AS I THOUGHT.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.905
WAIT. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO RUSH OFF.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.375
I STILL HAVE THOSE HEELS.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.880
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOKED,
GINGHAM AND STUFFED ANIMALS.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.982
HOW DID YOU
GET OUT OF THERE?

21:56.015 --> 21:59.852
I DIDN'T...
RIGHT AWAY.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.021
WASN'T ANYTHING WRONG
WITH HER PHYSICALLY.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.856
ONE DOWN, TWO MEMBERS
OF THE THREESOME TO GO.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.224
YOU SHOULD FLIP A CONDOM
TO CHOOSE.

22:05.257 --> 22:08.428
(Masters)
WE CHECKED HIS ADRENAL,
PITUITARY, AND THYROID GLANDS.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.397
MONITORED HIS CATECHOLAMINES.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.564
IT'S NOT A PHEO.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.433
WE HAD TO PUT HIM ON
A DILTIAZEM DRIP

22:13.466 --> 22:14.767
TO REGULATE HIS HEART.

22:14.801 --> 22:17.103
THAT MEANS HE'S
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.571
IT MEANS YOU ARE TOO.

22:18.605 --> 22:20.540
YOUR CAMPAIGN
TO SOFTEN HIM UP

22:20.573 --> 22:23.075
SO HE WOULD GO EASIER
ON THE KIDS...

22:23.109 --> 22:26.513
ALL IN A POINTLESS ATTEMPT
TO VALIDATE YOUR OWN UPBRINGING.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.580
[pagers beeping]

22:27.614 --> 22:28.915

ARRHYTHMIA?

22:28.948 --> 22:30.417
NOT OUR PATIENT.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.820
IT'S THE E.R.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.422
THAT PATIENT

22:35.455 --> 22:37.056
WITH BACK PAIN
AND URINARY RETENTION...

22:37.089 --> 22:39.426

A MATCHED SET?

22:39.459 --> 22:44.130
[pained grunts and groans]

22:48.935 --> 22:50.703
WE NEED TO TRACK
YOUR COMMON EXPOSURES.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.038
WHAT SHAMPOO
DO YOU USE?

22:52.071 --> 22:53.773
WHATEVER CRAP
THE CAMP GIVES US.

22:53.806 --> 22:54.574
SAME HERE.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.409
WE NEED THINGS
EXCLUSIVE TO YOU,

22:56.443 --> 22:57.343
BUT NOT THE REST OF THE CAMP.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.111
OTHERWISE, A LOT MORE PEOPLE
WOULD BE SICK.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.413
TOOTHPASTE,
DEODORANT.

23:00.447 --> 23:03.550
CAN'T BE DEODORANT
MAKING HIM SICK.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.684
HE DOESN'T WEAR ANY.
SMELLS LIKE A--

23:04.717 --> 23:05.752

23:05.785 --> 23:07.420
YOU'RE NOT MY DRILL INSTRUCTOR
IN HERE, OKAY?

23:07.454 --> 23:08.755
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU GET TO BE DISRESPECTFUL.

23:08.788 --> 23:09.956
I CAN DO WHATEVER
THE HELL I WANT.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.024

NO. BELIEVE ME, I ASKED.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.699
THOSE WERE SOME
FUN CONVERSATIONS.

23:19.732 --> 23:20.800
DO YOU BELIEVE THE ANSWERS?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.769
I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT
IS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE NO,

23:22.802 --> 23:23.903
BUT I DID.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.572
NOT LIKE THE KID HAS HAD

23:25.605 --> 23:26.773
MUCH UNSUPERVISED TIME

ARE FAIRLY LIMITED.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.531
HAD GIVEN YOU A REASON
TO EXPECT THAT.

DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

THEY'D BE PUKING AND POOPING.

WITH MORALIZING STRANGERS

29:41.613 --> 29:44.516
I MADE A COMPELLING
ARGUMENT, AND HE--

29:44.550 --> 29:47.053
IF HE CHANGED, IT'S BECAUSE
SOMETHING BESIDES YOU

29:47.086 --> 29:48.520
MADE THAT ARGUMENT
COMPELLING.

29:48.554 --> 29:49.488
(Taub)
COMPROMISED KIDNEYS

29:49.521 --> 29:50.923
SECONDARY
TO BLADDER ISSUES

29:50.957 --> 29:53.993
POINTS TO BOTULISM TOXIN,
WHICH LIVES IN SOIL.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.862
GOT INTO THE KID'S BLOODSTREAM

29:55.895 --> 29:57.596
THROUGH THE CUT
ON HIS FOREHEAD.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.597
GOT INTO THE DRILL
INSTRUCTOR'S

29:58.630 --> 30:00.066
THROUGH SOME ABRASIONS
ON HIS FEET.

30:01.567 --> 30:04.236
GOOD IDEA.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.838
GIVE 'EM BOTH
THE ANTITOXIN.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.013
I SAW MY CHANCE
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.882
I HAD TO TAKE IT.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.016
DON'T MAKE EXCUSES.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.517
YOU TRIED TO STEAL
FROM ME.

30:18.550 --> 30:19.952
OH, THESE KIDS ARE
MANIPULATORS.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.353
YOU CAN'T LET
YOUR GUARD DOWN.

30:21.387 --> 30:23.189
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"ALL THESE KIDS"?

30:23.222 --> 30:25.024
DON'T LUMP ME IN WITH
THE LOSERS AT THAT CAMP.

30:25.057 --> 30:26.058
SEEMS LIKE YOU
BELONG THERE.

30:26.092 --> 30:27.960
IT MAY BE
YOUR ONLY CHANCE.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.395
LOOK, I'VE SCREWED UP,

30:29.428 --> 30:31.097
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW.

30:31.130 --> 30:34.633
YOU SAID YOU WERE IN
FOR SHOPLIFTING.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.502
STORE OWNER CAUGHT ME TRYING
TO BOOST SOME CHIPS AND STUFF.

30:36.535 --> 30:39.638
CALLED MY DCS CASEWORKER.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.473
I THOUGHT ALL THE KIDS
WERE THERE UNDER COURT ORDER.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.209
THAT'S USUALLY HOW IT WORKS.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.211
SO WHY IS HE DIFFERENT?

30:51.550 --> 30:53.986
WHY WOULD I TAKE
A NAKED PICTURE OF YOU?

30:54.020 --> 30:55.988
YOU'RE CUTE,
BUT YOU'RE NOT THAT CUTE.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.189
NOW PLEASE GO.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.258
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE LEFT.
YOU'RE PISSED OFF.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.459
I'M PISSED OFF BECAUSE
YOU'RE IN MY APARTMENT,

31:00.492 --> 31:02.294
AND MY BOYFRIEND MIGHT
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.496
BOYFRIEND.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.933
LAST THING I WANT TO DO
IS PUBLICIZE

31:06.966 --> 31:09.568
THAT I CHEATED ON HIM,
SO WHY WOULD I PRANK YOU?

31:09.601 --> 31:11.603
AND WHERE WAS THIS BOYFRIEND
AT THE WEDDING?

31:11.637 --> 31:14.240
OUT OF TOWN.
CONVENIENTLY.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.145
IT'S FROM MY SISTER'S
BIRTHDAY LAST MONTH.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.247
AND BEFORE YOU SUGGEST
HE'S MY BROTHER,

31:21.280 --> 31:23.182
NOTE HOW I'M KISSING HIM.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.384
YOU USED ME, I USED YOU.
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.886
NOW I JUST WANT
TO FORGET ABOUT IT.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.929
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH LANDON'S DCS CASEWORKER.

31:36.963 --> 31:37.829
YOU WERE RIGHT.

31:37.863 --> 31:41.267
I'M NOT WHAT MADE
MY ARGUMENT COMPELLING.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.244
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

31:52.278 --> 31:54.446
TO GIVE YOUR BLADDER
AN ANTIBIOTIC WASH

31:54.480 --> 31:55.914
TO PROTECT AGAINST
INFECTION.

32:05.591 --> 32:09.028
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M DR. HOUSE.

32:09.061 --> 32:14.133
AND THAT BOY IS THE SPITTING
IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.969
OF COURSE,
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER,

32:17.003 --> 32:18.737
BUT HIS CARE WORKER TOLD
MY LACKEY

32:18.770 --> 32:23.575
THAT YOU PAID HIS
ENROLMENT FEE AT THE CAMP.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.677
THAT COULD MEAN THAT
YOU'RE A FAMILY FRIEND,

32:25.711 --> 32:27.646
BUT THEN, WHY HIDE IT?

32:27.679 --> 32:31.550
THE ONLY PERSON
WHO'D WANT TO HIDE IT...

32:31.583 --> 32:34.553
IS HIS DEADBEAT DAD,

32:34.586 --> 32:38.590
WHO HAS DECIDED NOT
TO BE A DEADBEAT ANYMORE.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.563
PLEASE, DON'T TELL HIM.

32:51.137 --> 32:54.273
WE SPEND DAYS LOOKING
FOR A LINK BETWEEN THEM,

32:54.306 --> 32:56.775
AND HE DOESN'T TELL US
THE KID IS HIS SON.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.510
WE WERE LOOKING FOR
EXPOSURES.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.512
HE DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS MEDICALLY RELEVANT.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.348
SOON, HE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT HIS KIDDING FINDING OUT.

33:02.381 --> 33:05.517
BEING DEAD MAKES
KEEPING SECRETS MUCH EASIER.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.519
NEITHER ONE WAS RESPONDING
TO BOTULISM TREATMENT,

33:07.553 --> 33:09.121
AND THE BOY STARTED
HAVING SEIZURES.

33:09.155 --> 33:11.023
AND DRISCOLL MIGHT
HAVE BEEN RIGHT

33:11.057 --> 33:12.558
THAT THEIR BIOLOGICAL
RELATIONSHIP DOESN'T MATTER.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.760
GENETIC ILLNESS EMERGES
WHEN PEOPLE ARE THE SAME AGE,

33:14.793 --> 33:17.129
NOT DURING THE SAME WEEK.
UNLESS THERE'S A TRIGGER.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.465
GENETIC CONDITIONS
CAN BE SET OFF

33:19.498 --> 33:20.399
BY THINGS IN THE SURROUNDINGS,

33:20.432 --> 33:22.334
AND THESE TWO OBVIOUSLY
SHARE SURROUNDINGS.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.603
THAT'S A RELATIVELY
RARE PHENOMENON.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.472
WHICH IS OUR SPECIALTY,
I KNOW.

33:26.505 --> 33:30.276
OUR PATIENTS ARE RELATED.
THAT CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE.

33:32.578 --> 33:34.180
I JUST HAD AN IDEA.

33:34.213 --> 33:37.349
RELEVANT TO OUR CASE?

33:37.383 --> 33:39.385
NO.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.487
SIT.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.056
WEGENER'S CAN BE BROUGHT ON
BY EXPOSURE TO HEAVY METALS.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.492
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING
AT THE CAMP?
NEAR THE ISOLATION HUT,

33:46.525 --> 33:49.161
THERE WERE SOME OLD
GENERATOR BATTERIES.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.829
COULD HAVE LEAKED
INTO THE SOIL?

33:50.862 --> 33:52.164
SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE ELSE
IN THE CAMP

33:52.198 --> 33:53.732
WOULD HAVE HAD LEAD POISONING.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.334
YOU GOT ANYTHING BETTER?

33:57.436 --> 34:00.739
TREAT WITH CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE.

34:00.772 --> 34:01.740
GO FIND YOUR BLISS.

34:05.111 --> 34:08.080
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A PLAY DATE.

34:16.122 --> 34:21.727
WHY DIDN'T YOU STEP FORWARD
WHEN HIS MOM DIED?

34:21.760 --> 34:25.531
I FOUND OUT SHE'D PASSED
MONTHS LATER.

34:25.564 --> 34:31.237
BY THEN, LANDON WAS ALREADY
IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.739
I WAS FIGURING OUT
A WAY TO APPROACH HIM

34:33.772 --> 34:35.174
WHEN HE GOT INTO TROUBLE,

34:35.207 --> 34:39.145
SO I BROUGHT HIM
TO THE CAMP.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.113
YOU NEED TO TELL HIM.

34:41.147 --> 34:44.816
I CAN'T.
NOT NOW.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.419
IF I DIE, THE ONLY THING
I'LL EVER BE TO HIM

34:47.453 --> 34:50.156
IS THE HARDASS WHO MADE HIM
RUN OBSTACLE COURSES.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.260
YOU'LL APOLOGIZE TO ME
FOR SOMETHING DONE

34:54.293 --> 34:55.461
IN A PSYCHOTIC STATE,

34:55.494 --> 34:57.163
BUT YOU WON'T OWN UP
TO BEING HIS FATHER.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.431
WHAT HAPPENED TO
"ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES,

34:59.465 --> 35:01.800
A MAN ACCEPTS THEM"?

35:01.833 --> 35:03.435
I'M IN HIS LIFE,

35:03.469 --> 35:07.306
AND I AM WORKING TO GET HIM
ON THE RIGHT PATH.

35:07.339 --> 35:12.144
HE DOESN'T NEED
A DRILL INSTRUCTOR.

35:12.178 --> 35:15.147
HE NEEDS A DAD.

35:20.219 --> 35:23.189
IT'S SO SWEET OF YOU
COMING TO THIS.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.324
JUST TRYING TO BE
SUPPORTIVE.

35:25.357 --> 35:28.694
I'VE HEARD THAT'S
WHAT BOYFRIENDS DO.

35:30.262 --> 35:33.865
HI, HONEY. HI.
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

35:33.899 --> 35:36.735
YEAH?

35:36.768 --> 35:38.270
[chuckles]

35:38.304 --> 35:41.707
RACHEL HAD A GREAT TIME.
PLAYED WITH EVERYTHING.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.242
SHE'S A VERY CLEVER GIRL.

35:46.578 --> 35:50.316
I'M SORRY TO ASK THIS,
BUT WE'VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS

35:50.349 --> 35:51.617
WITH PARENTS COACHING KIDS.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.886
RACHEL CAUGHT ONTO OUR TOYS
UNUSUALLY QUICKLY,

35:54.920 --> 35:57.756
AND SHE EVEN KNEW THE GAME
WAS CALLED "FEED THE MONKEY."

35:57.789 --> 36:01.960
UH, WELL, AS EAGER AS I AM
TO HAVE HER GO HERE,

36:01.993 --> 36:05.264
I PROMISE YOU
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

36:06.798 --> 36:07.766
HEY, RACHEL,

36:07.799 --> 36:10.802
HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED
"FEED THE MONKEY" BEFORE?

36:14.340 --> 36:15.707
NO, MAMA.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.349
SHE SEEMED SO DUMB,

36:23.382 --> 36:26.852
BUT WHEN THE PRESSURE WAS ON,
SHE KNEW WHAT HAD TO BE DONE,

36:26.885 --> 36:28.987
AND SHE DID IT.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.456
YOU'RE PUMPED
'CAUSE YOUR KID LIED?

36:30.489 --> 36:35.561
SHE'S NOT MY KID.
SHE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS.

36:35.594 --> 36:38.497
AND SHE'S A BETTER LIAR
THAN YOU ARE.

36:38.530 --> 36:42.268
YOU DIDN'T CUT YOUR LEG
GETTING INTO YOUR TRUCK.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.803
THE ABRASION HAS DIRT
AND GRAVEL IN IT.

36:44.836 --> 36:47.273
A BIT OF FERTILIZER TOO.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.708
TRIPPED IN MY GREENHOUSE.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.243
GROWING MY OWN
ORGANIC VEGGIES.

36:51.277 --> 36:54.513
DIDN'T ASK.
NOT GONNA TELL.

36:54.546 --> 36:58.016
SHE DIDN'T HESITATE.
SHE DIDN'T OVERSELL.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.019
TOOK ME YEARS TO LEARN
HOW TO LIE LIKE THAT.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.788
AND RACHEL HAS IT
ON INSTINCT.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.856
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
REAL FOND OF THAT KID.

37:04.890 --> 37:08.860
YOU'RE REALLY NOT GOOD
WITH NUANCE, ARE YOU?

37:08.894 --> 37:11.263
I ADMIRE HER TALENT.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.764
I'M JUST GONNA
NUMB YOU UP...

37:18.837 --> 37:21.440
I GOTTA GO.

37:24.843 --> 37:25.844
[door slides open]

37:25.877 --> 37:28.880
LATEST KIDNEY FUNCTION TEST
SHOWS NO IMPROVEMENT.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.983
NICE STITCHES.
DO THEY HURT?

37:32.017 --> 37:34.320
NO. THEY GAVE ME
A SHOT OF SOMETHING.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.054
THAT WAS LIDOCAINE.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.889
IT TRIGGERED AN UNDERLYING
GENETIC CONDITION

37:37.923 --> 37:40.326
CALLED VARIEGATE PORPHYRIA.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.961
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
THEIR SYMPTOMS.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.331
(Driscoll)
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY LIDOCAINE.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.698
BUT YOU HAD A HANDFUL
OF ANTIHISTAMINES,

37:46.732 --> 37:49.335
COURTESY OF THE DEVIANT
IN THE NEXT BED.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.869
(House)
IT'S ALSO A PORPHYRIA
TRIGGER.

37:50.902 --> 37:55.507
WAIT, SO WE HAVE THE SAME
GENETIC THING?

37:55.541 --> 37:57.008
YEAH...

37:57.042 --> 37:58.710
SMALL WORLD.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.812
(Masters)
THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

38:00.846 --> 38:03.515
WE CAN MANAGE THE CONDITION
WITH HEMATIN.

38:03.549 --> 38:06.885
A LIVER TRANSPLANT
COULD CURE IT.

38:08.887 --> 38:14.660
SOMETIMES TWO PATIENTS SHARE
ONE DONATED LIVER.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.995
WOULD THAT WORK FOR US?

38:17.028 --> 38:18.864
(Masters)
POSSIBLY.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.566
WE'D HAVE TO TEST YOUR BLOOD,
TISSUE TYPE.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.534
AND IF THEY MATCHED--
WHY WOULD THEY?

38:22.568 --> 38:24.770
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE
THE SAME THING MAKING US SICK...

38:24.803 --> 38:27.406
ALSO...

38:29.641 --> 38:33.579
I'M YOUR FATHER.

38:45.491 --> 38:46.525
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

38:46.558 --> 38:50.128
YOU DON'T THINK A WHITE GUY
CAN BE A BAD FATHER?

38:50.161 --> 38:52.631
(House)
HAPPY TO CHECK YOUR DNA.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.600
DO YOU REALLY THINK HE'D SAY
HE'S YOUR DAD IF HE ISN'T?

38:54.633 --> 38:57.536
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE A CATCH.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.847
(Chase)
YOU'RE EVIL.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.821
BARELY RECOGNIZE YOU
WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.890
YOU WERE AT THE WEDDING
WITH YOUR SISTER.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.459
SHARED A ROOM
WITH HER TOO.

39:20.492 --> 39:24.430
I CAME BY TO CHANGE
MY SHOES, AND...

39:24.463 --> 39:26.765
I FOUND YOU
IN THE BATHROOM.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.834
IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH
TO FIND ME.

39:28.867 --> 39:29.968
BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE
STARTS PRANKING YOU,

39:30.001 --> 39:32.671
THE LOGICAL SUSPECT IS
THE OVERLY PROTECTIVE SISTER

39:32.704 --> 39:33.939
OF THE WOMAN
YOU SLEPT WITH ONCE.

39:33.972 --> 39:37.175
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH MY SISTER.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.444
THEN WHAT DOES IT HAVE
TO DO WITH?

39:40.846 --> 39:42.814
IF YOU REALLY HAVE
NO CLUE,

39:42.848 --> 39:44.950
THEN YOU SO DESERVE THIS.

39:44.983 --> 39:47.653
ALL THAT CREATIVITY
AND ENERGY

39:47.686 --> 39:49.588
YOU PUT INTO
PRANKING ME...

39:49.621 --> 39:50.989
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WERE
TRYING TO MAKE A POINT.

39:51.022 --> 39:55.060
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT
TO TELL ME WHAT IT WAS?

39:55.093 --> 39:58.163
YOU'RE A REALLY BIG FAN
OF JOHN HUGHES MOVIES.

39:58.196 --> 40:01.066
YOU INEXPLICABLY PREFER
SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL

40:01.099 --> 40:03.168
TO SIXTEEN CANDLES THOUGH
THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE...

40:03.201 --> 40:06.204
MARY STUART MASTERSON LOOKED HOT
IN THOSE LEATHER GLOVES.

40:06.237 --> 40:09.074
WE TALKED
AT THE RECEPTION.

40:09.107 --> 40:12.143
THAT'S WHY YOU HATE ME?
IT WAS FUN.

40:12.177 --> 40:14.446
IT WAS GREAT...
UNTIL I MENTIONED THAT

40:14.480 --> 40:16.047
I DON'T SLEEP WITH GUYS
ON THE FIRST DATE.

40:16.081 --> 40:19.184
AND THEN YOU SAID YOU HAD
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,

40:19.217 --> 40:20.719
AND YOU NEVER CAME BACK.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.989
ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.057
DO YOU SEEK VENGEANCE
ON EVERY GUY

40:26.091 --> 40:27.493
WHO ACTS LIKE AN ASS?

40:27.526 --> 40:29.461
COULD BE A FULL-TIME JOB.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.732
WHEN WE WERE TALKING,
YOU SEEMED LIKE A NICE GUY.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.101
SO EITHER YOU'RE
A GREAT ACTOR,

40:36.134 --> 40:37.969
OR YOU'RE A NICE GUY
WHO LOST HIS WAY.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.104
WHATEVER THE REASONS,

40:39.137 --> 40:45.110
A LITTLE NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT
SEEMED TO BE WARRANTED.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.946
OH, CURRENTLY, YOUR PASSWORD IS
"GREAT BIG HO."

40:47.979 --> 40:51.116
CHANGE IT BACK TO ANYTHING
BUT "PASSWORD."

40:51.149 --> 40:55.654
HEY, I'M--I'M SORRY.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.958
LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU
BY TAKING YOU OUT TO DINNER.

40:59.991 --> 41:02.494
