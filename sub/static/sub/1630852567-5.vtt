00:02.006 --> 00:04.107
Cassidy is my... ex-wife.

00:05.109 --> 00:07.206
- How have you been?
- Pretty good.

00:08.241 --> 00:10.107
Except for a cancer scare
a few months back.

00:10.142 --> 00:11.569
Cancer?!

00:11.604 --> 00:13.470
You look good, too.

00:13.505 --> 00:17.206
I've been doing this amazing
life coach thing now.

00:17.241 --> 00:20.437
Learning to take responsibility
for my actions.

00:20.472 --> 00:22.998
She had to get used to you
not being here,

00:23.033 --> 00:24.668
and that's pretty much
all she's known.

00:24.703 --> 00:27.305
I'm trying to make up
for lost time;

00:27.340 --> 00:29.031
I'm trying to look after
the house,

00:29.066 --> 00:30.569
I'm trying to look after you.

00:30.604 --> 00:32.569
I-I want us all to be a family.

01:08.066 --> 01:11.031
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11.066 --> 01:13.338
- You don't look so good.
- No, I'm fine. It's just uh...

01:13.373 --> 01:16.206
I just have a sinus infection.
What's all this?

01:16.241 --> 01:19.031
I'm on the career path now
for a little while.

01:19.066 --> 01:21.206
No more boys.
- Looks like you robbed

01:21.241 --> 01:23.305
an AV store.
- Yeah, no.

01:23.340 --> 01:25.668
Um, I actually just borrowed
all this from a friend

01:25.703 --> 01:29.074
because I'm gonna be filming
an audition

01:29.109 --> 01:30.734
for a new cooking show.
- Oh my God!

01:30.769 --> 01:33.074
<i>That's amazing, Ross.
- It's a long shot, I know,</i>

01:33.109 --> 01:34.767
but I know how to sell myself.

01:34.802 --> 01:37.338
I'm young, I'm hot, I'm gay.

01:37.373 --> 01:39.173
<i>I'm Persian Canadian</i>

01:39.208 --> 01:41.107
Plus, I'm cooking authentic
Persian cuisine

01:41.142 --> 01:44.074
from family recipes.
How can they not pick me?

01:44.109 --> 01:46.140
Well, if there's anything
I can do to help.

01:46.175 --> 01:48.173
Okay. I mean, I could use
a camera person.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.074
Great. Done.

01:50.109 --> 01:52.074
- For sure.
- Okay, yeah.

01:52.109 --> 01:54.338
Oof...
- Oh, but...

01:54.373 --> 01:56.107
Not if you're not feeling well.

01:56.142 --> 01:58.338
- I'm good.
- You rest for a minute.

01:58.373 --> 02:01.404
Um, Grandpa made a mess,
so I'm gonna clean up.

02:11.274 --> 02:13.701
- Hi, Boss!
- Hey, Alphonse.

02:13.736 --> 02:15.635
I, uh, I don't think I'm gonna
come into the office today.

02:15.670 --> 02:17.470
I'm not feeling so good.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.767
Oh! Dr. Thompson's away too.

02:19.802 --> 02:22.140
Remember, he has that author
conference for his last book.

02:22.175 --> 02:25.338
<i>So... what should I do?</i>

02:25.373 --> 02:27.338
<i>Jenny: I forgot. Well...</i>

02:27.373 --> 02:29.140
let's just hope
it's a slow day.

02:32.142 --> 02:33.668
Malik: This place is my old
stomping grounds.

02:33.703 --> 02:36.140
I can't tell you how much time
we used to spend here as a kid.

02:36.175 --> 02:37.800
Hey. I made out with
Amber Small

02:37.835 --> 02:39.536
right there in that corner
for first time.

02:39.571 --> 02:41.503
Donovan: All right, tell me
something we can use.

02:41.538 --> 02:43.536
Well, this place is always bustling.

02:43.571 --> 02:45.833
You know, multi-generational
families, community based,

02:45.868 --> 02:48.602
wholesome, and... usually safe.

02:52.208 --> 02:53.833
9-mill shell casing.

03:03.538 --> 03:06.833
Well... there goes
the neighbourhood.

03:06.868 --> 03:08.437
Damn.

03:08.472 --> 03:10.239
All right, let's get Jenny
on the phone.

03:21.538 --> 03:23.668
<i>Jenny: Hey, River.
What do you see?</i>

03:23.703 --> 03:26.833
<i>River: I see trampled grass.
Looks like a shell casing.</i>

03:26.868 --> 03:29.734
<i>Bystanders, cops questioning locals.</i>

03:29.769 --> 03:32.239
<i>There's a blood trail
and the decedent.</i>

03:32.274 --> 03:34.239
Make sure you check that
they're human remains.

03:34.274 --> 03:37.800
People bury all sorts
of stuff at the park.

03:37.835 --> 03:40.569
<i>River: Last summer we found
a "synthetic companion"</i>

03:40.604 --> 03:42.239
<i>that some guy buried</i>

03:42.274 --> 03:44.206
to hide from his girlfriend.

03:44.241 --> 03:46.602
<i>Dennis: This is why
we don't kink shame.</i>

03:53.802 --> 03:55.833
Ah...

03:55.868 --> 03:58.140
should we do the uh... "thing"?

03:58.175 --> 04:00.239
I'll do the honours.

04:05.802 --> 04:08.734
Yo'nikonhr'aksa't tsi...

04:08.769 --> 04:11.272
satenhnisero'kte.

04:11.307 --> 04:13.833
<i>Sken:nenkenhak.</i>

04:13.868 --> 04:15.569
<i>Jenny: Thanks, River.</i>

04:15.604 --> 04:17.800
Uh, Dennis, I'm gonna need
to get some prints.

04:17.835 --> 04:19.437
<i>Dennis:</i>

04:25.637 --> 04:27.932
Uh, he's holding something.

04:29.967 --> 04:31.899
Here you go.
- All right.

04:34.538 --> 04:36.437
Hey, uh, can I talk to Jenny
for a minute?

04:41.274 --> 04:44.239
Hey, Jenny. I hear you're
under the weather.

04:44.274 --> 04:46.701
Meh. It takes a lot
to keep me down.

04:46.736 --> 04:48.668
She wants me to get wine.

04:50.868 --> 04:52.569
'Course, there is no wine!

04:53.571 --> 04:55.470
Right as rain, but I think
I'll be doing the investigation

04:55.505 --> 04:57.602
from the couch.

04:57.637 --> 04:59.338
Red wine...

05:05.505 --> 05:07.503
Hey, Donovan!

05:07.538 --> 05:09.800
Jenny? Wha--?

05:09.835 --> 05:11.272
<i>Donovan, can you hear me?</i>

05:11.307 --> 05:13.437
- Wine...
- Dad! Dad!

05:14.439 --> 05:17.272
Red wine?

05:17.307 --> 05:19.404
Oh...
- Dad, did you...

05:19.439 --> 05:21.701
- Did I do something?
- Ugh! You uh...

05:21.736 --> 05:24.338
- 'Course I did.
- You banged the router. Ugh...

05:26.538 --> 05:27.998
I didn't mean to.

05:29.033 --> 05:31.899
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yeah. I didn't tell ya?

05:31.934 --> 05:33.833
Me and Peggy are gonna go up
to Niagara-on-the-Lake

05:33.868 --> 05:35.404
and try and reconnect
a little bit.

05:35.439 --> 05:37.305
Mm. Great.

05:37.340 --> 05:39.800
I got some, uh, healthy
snacks for the road.

05:39.835 --> 05:41.965
Good.
There we go.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.701
Jenny, you don't look well.

05:43.736 --> 05:46.305
I'm fine. It's just a...
a... it's just a bug.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.404
Oh, Gordy, maybe we should postpone.

05:48.439 --> 05:49.965
- NO! No.
- No!

05:50.000 --> 05:52.701
I'm good. I'm totally fine.

05:52.736 --> 05:55.371
Oh, please, don't stress
about Jenny.

05:55.406 --> 05:58.272
She's a doctor, you know.

05:58.307 --> 06:00.338
There's not much in
the wallet, except 20 bucks

06:00.373 --> 06:01.932
and a library card.

06:01.967 --> 06:03.602
The library gave me his name:
Rameen Shirazi.

06:03.637 --> 06:05.031
Did they give you
his address?

06:05.066 --> 06:06.602
Yeah.
I'm gonna head there now.

06:06.637 --> 06:08.569
Uh, send a uniform instead.

06:08.604 --> 06:10.371
You know this area,
I want you here.

06:10.406 --> 06:11.998
Okay, Boss.

06:12.033 --> 06:13.569
We've got officers searching
every inch of this place,

06:13.604 --> 06:15.470
so if there's anything to find,
we'll find it.

06:17.637 --> 06:19.338
What's up? You got a look.

06:19.373 --> 06:21.338
You know, when a body's found
buried like that,

06:21.373 --> 06:23.734
it's usually done by someone
who cared about the victim.

06:23.769 --> 06:25.668
Well, these are God-fearing,
salt of the earth type folks.

06:25.703 --> 06:27.503
There's mostly refugees
and immigrants

06:27.538 --> 06:29.371
full of hospitality.

06:29.406 --> 06:31.031
It's too early
to discount anything.

06:31.066 --> 06:33.437
Officer Stanley: Found
something in the creek!

06:33.472 --> 06:35.734
It's the 9-millimeter.
It matches the casing we found.

06:35.769 --> 06:37.371
Bag it and get it
to ballistics ASAP.

06:37.406 --> 06:39.074
Yes, Sir.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.899
Where do the park regulars
usually hang out?

06:42.934 --> 06:45.107
Well, when I lived around
here, it was the picnic area.

06:46.109 --> 06:48.635
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

06:56.538 --> 06:58.767
River: Look how carefully
trimmed his beard is.

06:58.802 --> 07:00.635
And his hair is so neat.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.602
Reminds me of my Grandfather.

07:03.604 --> 07:05.437
He dyed his facial hair.

07:05.472 --> 07:07.635
The man had champagne taste.

07:07.670 --> 07:09.503
The moonstone ring,

07:09.538 --> 07:11.932
the watch, the belt...

07:15.439 --> 07:17.767
the pen, clothes -
all high-end,

07:17.802 --> 07:19.536
but they've seen better days.

07:19.571 --> 07:21.107
So he liked nice things,

07:21.142 --> 07:23.998
but maybe he couldn't afford
new nice things.

07:25.637 --> 07:27.833
I have the intake CT scans here.

07:28.835 --> 07:31.866
And I have sent them
to Dr. Cooper as well.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.899
You're outside!
That's good.

07:34.934 --> 07:36.668
The fresh air will help you
feel better.

07:36.703 --> 07:38.536
Yeah, and it's quieter.

07:38.571 --> 07:41.140
My family's seen enough
autopsy photos for my liking.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.470
Hey, do you guys see that
opaque spot?

07:45.505 --> 07:48.031
Looks like a bullet lodged
near the subclavian artery.

07:48.066 --> 07:50.107
Jenny: It's on here.

07:50.142 --> 07:51.734
Can you show me
the entry wound?

07:54.670 --> 07:56.866
Entry in the upper right pectoralis.

07:56.901 --> 07:58.668
<i>Burns suggest contact entry,</i>

07:58.703 --> 08:01.536
<i>meaning the barrel was pressed
to his skin.</i>

08:01.571 --> 08:03.998
There's an exit wound
on the lateral side

08:04.033 --> 08:05.767
of the right shoulder.

08:08.109 --> 08:10.031
<i>Dennis: If he still has
a bullet inside him,</i>

08:10.066 --> 08:11.701
why does he have an exit wound?

08:11.736 --> 08:13.965
I've seen this before.
It's uh...

08:14.000 --> 08:15.866
<i>it's called "tandem bullet"
phenomenon.</i>

08:15.901 --> 08:18.470
It's when the bullet splits
in the barrel

08:18.505 --> 08:20.569
and it creates two projectiles.

08:20.604 --> 08:22.503
What caused it in your case?

08:22.538 --> 08:24.635
Well, the gun had a silencer
on it.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.833
Wait. So you're saying this
man was...

08:26.868 --> 08:28.932
Executed.

08:33.175 --> 08:34.899
<i>Donovan: Over there -
metal detector guy.</i>

08:34.934 --> 08:36.569
<i>Looks like a regular.</i>

08:39.637 --> 08:42.932
- Amoo! Amoo!
- 'Scuse me, Sir? Sir!

08:42.967 --> 08:45.503
- No English.
- Hey! Yo!

08:45.538 --> 08:48.503
Officers, I'm Shayan.
Uh, this is my uncle, Ali.

08:48.538 --> 08:50.668
Uh, he's not like my actual
uncle, not like by blood,

08:50.703 --> 08:53.140
but, um, I just call him
my uncle. Know what I mean?

08:53.175 --> 08:54.767
Yeah, yeah,
we know what you mean.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.668
Yeah, um,
Ali doesn't speak English,

08:56.703 --> 08:58.536
but I could help translate
if you like.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.536
Uh, what language does
he speak?

09:00.571 --> 09:02.734
Farsi-Dari.
Yeah, he's Afghani.

09:02.769 --> 09:05.767
I'm Persian, and we speak
the same language, kind of.

09:05.802 --> 09:08.173
Yeah, it's like, it's like
regular English and Patois,

09:08.208 --> 09:09.734
feel me?

09:11.769 --> 09:13.965
Do you guys know this man,
Rameen Shirazi?

09:17.835 --> 09:19.569
Uh... nah.

09:19.604 --> 09:22.206
Damn, I-I mean,
I saw him here and there.

09:22.241 --> 09:24.206
Yeah, he worked out alone
in the park a lot.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.536
Yeah, my uncle called him
a lone wolf.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.074
He has no friends.

09:32.109 --> 09:33.767
So you never saw him
with anyone?

09:43.241 --> 09:45.074
Yeah, he's freaked out
talking to you guys.

09:45.109 --> 09:47.140
I mean, where he comes from, man,

09:47.175 --> 09:49.734
the authorities, well,
they'd twist you up real good

09:49.769 --> 09:51.602
even if you like look at them
the wrong way.

09:51.637 --> 09:53.272
We're not, we're not here
to deport anyone.

09:53.307 --> 09:55.239
We just wanna make the
community feel safe

09:55.274 --> 09:56.635
and find out what happened,
you know?

09:56.670 --> 09:58.569
All right.

09:58.604 --> 10:01.734
- Where'd you get those?
- Kaftar.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.272
Uh... kaftar. Uh, pigeons.

10:04.307 --> 10:06.569
Yeah, he's got a small
pigeon coop on his balcony.

10:06.604 --> 10:08.734
Yo, Middle Easterns, man,
we're a special breed.

10:15.208 --> 10:16.767
Do you know what this means?

10:17.835 --> 10:20.074
Uh, nah, I don't read Farsi,
but um...

10:23.802 --> 10:26.272
- Degargoony.
- Degargoony.

10:26.307 --> 10:29.305
Uh, it's like...
it's like grow, or transform,

10:29.340 --> 10:30.932
or something like that.

10:30.967 --> 10:32.668
They got these translation apps.

10:32.703 --> 10:34.635
Maybe that'd help you out?

10:34.670 --> 10:36.734
Uh, let's get a Farsi
translator here.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.668
I'll call 'em, but heads up,
last time it took two hours.

10:39.703 --> 10:41.305
<i>Shayan: I can help you out.</i>

10:42.703 --> 10:44.206
<i>Sure. Thanks.</i>

10:44.241 --> 10:46.173
This is Sara.
She might know something.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.173
- Hi there. 'Scuse me.
- Hi.

10:48.208 --> 10:49.965
- Salam, Sara.
- Salam.

10:51.670 --> 10:53.569
Um, are you a regular
at the park?

10:53.604 --> 10:55.833
- Eat. Please, eat.
- Uh, no thanks, ma'am.

10:55.868 --> 10:58.602
I'm on duty.
- Thank you.

10:58.637 --> 11:00.767
We need these people
to trust us.

11:02.802 --> 11:04.833
Does this man look familiar
to you?

11:04.868 --> 11:07.206
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Tragedy.

11:07.241 --> 11:08.767
What can you tell us
about him?

11:08.802 --> 11:11.965
I always invite him for food,
offer drink.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.635
He was very polite,
but he never joined.

11:14.670 --> 11:16.866
Are you aware of any gang
activity in the area?

11:16.901 --> 11:18.965
Gang? What is gang?

11:28.736 --> 11:31.206
Uh, nah. No gangs,
not like that.

11:31.241 --> 11:33.965
It took all that
just to say that?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.031
Nah, she was just actually
lecturing me

11:36.066 --> 11:37.866
to, you know,
kinda watch you guys

11:37.901 --> 11:39.965
'cause I just got into a
paralegal program at Humber,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.371
so... and all these park aunties
and uncles

11:42.406 --> 11:43.998
always up in my business,
you know?

11:44.033 --> 11:46.140
Sir!

11:47.703 --> 11:49.734
A snack for later.

11:52.274 --> 11:54.272
- Thank you.
- No problem.

11:57.066 --> 11:59.899
Both:

12:01.000 --> 12:02.899
<i>Jenny: Hey, Alphonse,
what did you find?</i>

12:02.934 --> 12:04.800
Yeah, I thought he was
an immigrant.

12:04.835 --> 12:06.404
The postcard of the Caspian Sea

12:06.439 --> 12:07.965
<i>and the Farsi note
kind of gave it away.</i>

12:08.000 --> 12:10.074
<i>So I called the Ministry
of Immigration,</i>

12:10.109 --> 12:11.899
<i>Refugees and Citizenship.</i>

12:11.934 --> 12:13.371
<i>Turns out he was a judge
in Iran.</i>

12:13.406 --> 12:15.305
Came to Canada as a refugee
10 years ago,

12:15.340 --> 12:17.272
became a permanent resident
5 years ago.

12:17.307 --> 12:20.173
<i>He has no family here and none
that I could find in Iran.</i>

12:20.208 --> 12:21.965
You know what's his refugee
claim?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.767
Political persecution.

12:23.802 --> 12:25.998
I mean, he made some rulings
against government officials.

12:26.033 --> 12:27.767
They seized his assets
and he fled.

12:29.439 --> 12:30.833
Oh, uh...

12:30.868 --> 12:33.140
uh, good work, Alphonse,
I gotta go.

12:33.175 --> 12:34.899
Um, can you fill in Donovan?

12:34.934 --> 12:37.074
Sure thing, will do.

12:39.373 --> 12:42.031
So this is Agha Reza.
He's one of the OG's here.

12:42.066 --> 12:44.371
Uh, he used to be a doctor
back in Iran,

12:44.406 --> 12:47.173
but now he basically lives here
at the park.

12:48.340 --> 12:50.338
Do you recognize this man?

12:53.340 --> 12:55.371
Agha Reza!

12:56.835 --> 12:58.998
Can't hear!

13:10.934 --> 13:12.965
He says he was like a genius.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.173
A private and sad genius.

13:15.208 --> 13:17.767
Does he have any idea
who might have hurt him?

13:25.142 --> 13:26.866
He says he's sorry,
he can't help you.

13:29.472 --> 13:32.437
Uniforms found something
burning in the trash can.

13:32.472 --> 13:34.338
All right. Hey, you mind
sticking around

13:34.373 --> 13:36.470
in case we need you again?
- Yeah, I'll be here.

13:37.835 --> 13:40.074
All right, let's go.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.800
Delivery woman: Beds & Stuff
delivery for Gordon Cooper.

13:45.835 --> 13:47.338
Yeah.

13:47.373 --> 13:49.031
What is it?

13:49.066 --> 13:51.437
It's probably too small
to be a bed.

13:51.472 --> 13:53.338
Right. So "Stuff" it is.

13:53.373 --> 13:55.734
Ungh. Dad!

13:55.769 --> 13:58.833
Hey, Smiler, have you seen
your mo-- uh, Peggy?

13:58.868 --> 14:01.140
She's pulling a Houdini on me today.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.338
No, but you got some packages.

14:03.373 --> 14:05.239
Oh, not for me.
I didn't order anything.

14:05.274 --> 14:06.932
Did I order anything?

14:06.967 --> 14:08.800
Thank you.

14:08.835 --> 14:11.074
Oh, hang on! Look,
it says Gordon Cooper on it.

14:11.109 --> 14:13.470
<i>Oh, ho, ho, ho, yeah,
I know what this is.</i>

14:13.505 --> 14:16.074
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!

14:16.109 --> 14:18.371
<i>I was gonna go for the satin,</i>

14:18.406 --> 14:21.140
but I decided on the silk.

14:21.175 --> 14:23.239
- Boundaries, Dad!
- Oh, sorry.

14:25.868 --> 14:28.140
It looks like Rameen had this
on him the night he was killed

14:28.175 --> 14:30.239
and someone tried to get rid
of the evidence.

14:30.274 --> 14:31.965
I mean, over a dozen interviews,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.404
and not much to go on.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.437
A loner. A genius.
Polite but private.

14:35.472 --> 14:37.833
<i>Everyone knew "of" him,
but no one really knew him.</i>

14:37.868 --> 14:39.437
We got pay stubs in here.

14:39.472 --> 14:42.031
A stack of 'em from a nearby restaurant.

14:42.066 --> 14:44.107
Looks like Rameen worked
as a busser.

14:44.142 --> 14:45.833
They didn't even bother
to spell his name right

14:45.868 --> 14:47.404
on the name tag.

14:47.439 --> 14:49.569
We got job applications
from law firms all over town.

14:54.066 --> 14:55.767
You got that uh...

14:55.802 --> 14:57.470
you got that note on you?

14:57.505 --> 14:59.371
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:06.934 --> 15:08.866
I downloaded that
translator app

15:08.901 --> 15:10.569
that Shayan was talking about.

15:14.033 --> 15:15.899
Date.

15:15.934 --> 15:17.965
Name vs Name.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.305
Conflict. Verdict. Resolution.

15:20.340 --> 15:21.932
It's a ledger of some sort.

15:21.967 --> 15:24.305
Like this guy was keeping track
of disputes.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.305
This is the last page
with any writing on it.

15:27.505 --> 15:29.107
And it's got yesterday's date.

15:29.142 --> 15:32.031
Uh, looks like he made
a ruling of some kind.

15:32.066 --> 15:34.470
Reza, Sara and Ali.

15:43.604 --> 15:45.899
You said you didn't know him,
but as it turns out,

15:45.934 --> 15:48.239
you might be the last three
to see him alive.

15:48.274 --> 15:50.305
So, either start talking or
find yourselves a good lawyer

15:50.340 --> 15:52.866
because right now,
you're my primary suspects.

16:08.340 --> 16:10.140
What kind of trouble
was Rameen in?

16:10.175 --> 16:11.932
He was a good, lawful man.

16:11.967 --> 16:13.569
Then maybe you wanna stop
wasting my time

16:13.604 --> 16:15.305
and help me catch whoever
killed him!

16:15.340 --> 16:16.899
He was my friend.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.536
I knew him better than anyone.

16:18.571 --> 16:20.404
How do you think an
Obstruction of Justice charge

16:20.439 --> 16:22.272
is gonna look on the record
of someone studying law?

16:22.307 --> 16:24.536
I was afraid to get involved.
Plus, Rameen's dead.

16:24.571 --> 16:26.470
It's not like talking's
gonna do anything.

16:26.505 --> 16:28.503
Whoever killed him
is still out there!

16:28.538 --> 16:30.404
You can't save your friend,

16:30.439 --> 16:32.635
but maybe you can help save
someone else's life.

16:32.670 --> 16:35.074
Fff...

16:35.109 --> 16:36.998
yeah, of course.

16:42.208 --> 16:44.272
Look, Rameen was a judge
back at home,

16:44.307 --> 16:46.404
and he went against
some government guy

16:46.439 --> 16:48.206
after the Green protests.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.239
He stuck to his oath, he didn't
fold under the pressure, but...

16:51.274 --> 16:52.899
they ruined his life.

16:52.934 --> 16:55.107
So he came here to start over, but...

16:55.142 --> 16:57.404
yo, the legal system
in this country is tough.

16:58.406 --> 17:01.031
<i>Plus, the language barrier.
I mean...</i>

17:01.066 --> 17:03.239
<i>But he found a way
to make a living,</i>

17:03.274 --> 17:05.470
but it wasn't a life,
you know?

17:07.109 --> 17:09.503
We found a ledger of some
sort in his briefcase.

17:09.538 --> 17:11.107
You wanna tell me what
that's about?

17:11.142 --> 17:12.965
He used it to help
the community

17:13.000 --> 17:14.668
when there were beefs.

17:14.703 --> 17:17.173
If there is ever a dispute,
or unfairness,

17:17.208 --> 17:19.371
Rameen would make a judgement.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.437
This is why we met him yesterday.

17:21.472 --> 17:23.602
He advised and brought peace
to our community.

17:23.637 --> 17:26.272
He was a strong man,
a fair man,

17:26.307 --> 17:28.305
but a too proud man.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.272
Stay put, all of you.
We're not done here.

17:32.307 --> 17:34.338
You too.

17:45.604 --> 17:47.031
<i>Tell me you got something
we can use,</i>

17:47.066 --> 17:48.734
'cause, right now, all I got
is a bunch of people

17:48.769 --> 17:50.635
who don't trust me enough
to tell me the truth.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.536
Page after page
Ali's name is mentioned,

17:52.571 --> 17:54.536
and almost every single time
Rameen ruled against him.

17:54.571 --> 17:56.305
Look at this footnote
from yesterday's ruling.

17:57.967 --> 17:59.668
Ali upset.

18:01.142 --> 18:03.074
Forensics was able to pull
a partial print

18:03.109 --> 18:05.074
from the gun I found.

18:07.736 --> 18:10.074
Ali Azdi.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.272
Ross: Momaney, I need you
to translate the notes

18:20.307 --> 18:22.371
on Dad's recipe cards.

18:22.406 --> 18:25.107
Yeah. Yeah,
I sent them to you.

18:25.142 --> 18:28.107
Yeah. Yeah, the chat
with my name on it.

18:29.538 --> 18:32.701
Okay, no, I'm not making
Fesenjoon for a boyfriend

18:32.736 --> 18:35.470
because I don't have
a boyfriend.

18:36.472 --> 18:38.206
Moona, I'm 20!

18:38.241 --> 18:41.031
I'm not gonna die alone, okay?!

18:41.066 --> 18:43.272
Okay.
All right, I love you, too.

18:43.307 --> 18:45.107
Bye.

18:45.142 --> 18:47.107
Hey, um...

18:47.142 --> 18:49.371
Grandpa was looking for you.
I don't know where.

18:49.406 --> 18:51.206
He was doing like an oil change
or something.

18:51.241 --> 18:53.031
I'm a little nervous
about going on this trip

18:53.066 --> 18:54.701
with Jenny so unwell.

18:54.736 --> 18:56.404
And if she wasn't so dang stubborn

18:56.439 --> 18:58.470
and would actually let me
look after her,

18:58.505 --> 19:01.173
but I think that this chicken
soup is gonna help.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.338
- S-- Uh, chicken?!
- Uh-huh.

19:03.373 --> 19:05.305
- Grandma!
- Mmm!

19:05.340 --> 19:08.107
Please tell me you did not
use the chicken in the fridge.

19:08.142 --> 19:11.173
Well, the chicken didn't tell
me who it belonged to, Ross.

19:11.208 --> 19:14.338
Okay, so...now I gotta go back
to the store.

19:14.373 --> 19:16.437
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

19:16.472 --> 19:18.536
Um... look, why don't you...

19:18.571 --> 19:21.206
why don't you get ready
for your trip, huh?

19:21.241 --> 19:23.140
Have a good time.

19:27.670 --> 19:29.635
More? More bedroom stuff?

19:29.670 --> 19:31.701
Really!

19:44.406 --> 19:47.206
River: His right chest cavity
is filled with blood.

19:47.241 --> 19:49.239
Dennis: The bullet must've
grazed the upper pleura.

19:50.274 --> 19:52.404
You know if you're going
to execute someone,

19:52.439 --> 19:54.536
this is a really bizarre way
to do it.

19:54.571 --> 19:56.470
A shot to the head or heart, sure,

19:56.505 --> 19:59.338
but to his chest,
to his pec muscle?

20:00.571 --> 20:02.800
You know, that park today
was nice.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.206
Etobicoke could be a good
option, don't you think?

20:06.802 --> 20:09.206
Well, our decedent would beg
to differ.

20:10.769 --> 20:13.701
Dennis, I like it downtown.

20:14.703 --> 20:16.701
It's cozy.
It's where my community is.

20:16.736 --> 20:18.569
Do we have 2 million
for a teardown?

20:18.604 --> 20:20.503
Now, Port Hope is affordable.

20:20.538 --> 20:22.800
I know you love
your hometown,

20:22.835 --> 20:26.371
but my found family is here
in the city.

20:26.406 --> 20:29.767
Port Hope has a queer community.

20:29.802 --> 20:32.239
Two married guys named Brian
workout at my gym

20:32.274 --> 20:34.239
and everyone loves them.

20:35.736 --> 20:39.866
Well, if Port Hope ever has
a Two-Spirit Powwow,

20:39.901 --> 20:41.668
I'll consider it.
Until then,

20:41.703 --> 20:43.569
I'll stay house poor
in the city.

20:47.571 --> 20:50.668
Uh... that's not a fragment,
that's a whole bullet.

20:50.703 --> 20:53.305
.22 calibre,
by the looks of it.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.338
As corroded as heck.

20:55.373 --> 20:57.206
So, it's an old bullet?

20:57.241 --> 20:58.866
I'd say it's been inside
Rameen's body

20:58.901 --> 21:01.437
for 4 or 5 years at least.

21:03.604 --> 21:06.371
<i>We found a scar capsule just
below the right clavicle.</i>

21:08.340 --> 21:09.932
Okay, so...

21:11.637 --> 21:15.536
that is where the .22 calibre's
been hiding all these years.

21:17.373 --> 21:19.239
All right, guys,
let me just...

21:19.274 --> 21:21.338
let me just figure this out.

21:21.373 --> 21:23.866
So the 9mm, it entered here...

21:25.373 --> 21:27.800
and it grazed the axis
of the pleura

21:27.835 --> 21:30.272
and exited out the shoulder.

21:31.637 --> 21:34.668
The .22 calibre started here,

21:34.703 --> 21:36.899
in the scar capsule,

21:36.934 --> 21:38.899
ended here.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.371
River: So what're you thinking?

21:43.406 --> 21:44.866
<i>Jenny: I'm thinking that
the 9mm</i>

21:44.901 --> 21:46.503
<i>that Rameen was shot with
last night</i>

21:46.538 --> 21:48.602
hit the .22 calibre bullet,
and pushed it...

21:49.604 --> 21:52.470
through the subclavian artery
into the neck.

21:52.505 --> 21:54.668
Like a pool hall trick shot.

21:54.703 --> 21:57.536
Yeah, but if that's the case, then...

21:57.571 --> 21:59.866
it adds a whole new element
to the investigation.

21:59.901 --> 22:02.635
- How so?
- Well, there was this uh...

22:02.670 --> 22:04.899
<i>this case, I think it was
in New York</i>

22:04.934 --> 22:06.536
<i>and there was an embedded bullet</i>

22:06.571 --> 22:09.569
<i>that became lethally infected
ten years after the shooting.</i>

22:09.604 --> 22:12.932
So, the shooter's charges
were upgraded

22:12.967 --> 22:16.437
from attempted murder
to second degree.

22:16.472 --> 22:18.899
<i>Dennis: If the old bullet
wasn't in Rameen's body,</i>

22:18.934 --> 22:20.734
<i>he would still be alive.</i>

22:20.769 --> 22:23.503
Whoever shot Rameen
5 years ago

22:23.538 --> 22:25.602
is just as responsible
for his death

22:25.637 --> 22:27.767
as whoever shot him
last night?

22:27.802 --> 22:29.503
Yeah. So...

22:32.033 --> 22:33.998
we're not looking
for one killer,

22:34.033 --> 22:35.932
we're looking for two.

22:38.571 --> 22:39.998
Ali: Please! I did nothing.

22:40.033 --> 22:41.932
I'm a good man.
I didn't hurt anyone!

22:41.967 --> 22:43.404
Shayan, come with me.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.701
Hey, look, my uncle's
innocent, man.

22:46.736 --> 22:48.767
He's not gonna hurt nobody,
all right? You heard the news

22:48.802 --> 22:50.272
on Afghanistan, man,
he can't go back!

22:50.307 --> 22:52.272
Then I need you to translate
for us so he understands

22:52.307 --> 22:54.371
exactly what's happening to him
and all his rights.

22:54.406 --> 22:55.932
Hold on a second, guys.

22:55.967 --> 22:57.866
Hey, Jenny, I'm kinda in
the middle of it right now.

22:57.901 --> 22:59.767
<i>Jenny: Hey! There was another
bullet inside of Rameen</i>

22:59.802 --> 23:02.404
<i>from a shooting 5 years ago.</i>

23:02.439 --> 23:04.932
So, the bullet from last night

23:04.967 --> 23:07.965
<i>pushed the old bullet
through an artery in his neck</i>

23:08.000 --> 23:10.470
<i>and that's what killed him.</i>

23:10.505 --> 23:12.635
So are you saying whoever
shot Rameen 5 years ago

23:12.670 --> 23:14.470
<i>is partly responsible
for his death?</i>

23:14.505 --> 23:16.635
Yeah. Just as responsible
for killing him.

23:16.670 --> 23:18.371
<i>Donovan: Hold on a sec.
I've gotta call you back.</i>

23:18.406 --> 23:20.404
Yeah.

23:21.967 --> 23:25.031
Shayan, who shot Rameen
5 years ago?

23:28.571 --> 23:30.404
Was it you?

23:37.637 --> 23:40.107
I was an idiot punk.
I got caught up in a bad crowd.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.338
<i>I pulled a piece during
a basketball game.</i>

23:44.373 --> 23:46.602
Rameen, he was there,
and he, uh,

23:46.637 --> 23:49.371
he tried to get in the middle
of it to break it up.

23:49.406 --> 23:51.470
The gun went off and um...

23:51.505 --> 23:53.338
And you shot him.

23:53.373 --> 23:55.833
But Rameen wouldn't go
to the hospital.

23:55.868 --> 23:58.338
Didn't want to mess up
his refugee status.

23:58.373 --> 24:00.635
Uncle Reza, he cleaned up
the wounds

24:01.934 --> 24:03.800
<i>and um...</i>

24:03.835 --> 24:05.536
<i>he said to leave the bullet in</i>

24:05.571 --> 24:07.503
<i>'cause it wasn't near anything dangerous.</i>

24:08.769 --> 24:10.404
Rameen must've still been
pretty upset with you,

24:10.439 --> 24:11.998
even if it was an accident.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.635
Yeah, he was furious.

24:13.670 --> 24:15.800
But instead of ratting me out
to the cops, he...

24:15.835 --> 24:17.536
he took me under his wing.

24:18.571 --> 24:20.866
Every Friday we'd uh...
we'd have tea at the park,

24:20.901 --> 24:23.503
and we'd talk, we'd exercise.

24:25.670 --> 24:27.470
He always said if you...
if you get your body right,

24:27.505 --> 24:29.173
y-you get your mind right.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.767
Seems you're the only one
who spent any time with him.

24:32.802 --> 24:35.470
I watched the man pound
the pavement daily.

24:36.472 --> 24:39.140
Knocking at doors at law firms.

24:39.175 --> 24:41.767
I mean, that, that inspired me
to, to work harder,

24:42.769 --> 24:44.932
get my grades sorted,
and apply to college.

24:46.033 --> 24:47.965
If you're the only one
who really knew him,

24:48.000 --> 24:49.998
you might be the only person
who knows

24:50.033 --> 24:53.437
who might have shot him.
- Nah, man, that's the thing.

24:53.472 --> 24:55.503
<i>It was never about him.</i>

24:55.538 --> 24:57.437
<i>It was only about me.</i>

24:58.439 --> 25:00.569
<i>He never opened up.</i>

25:00.604 --> 25:03.800
I mean, the guy,
the guy saved my life

25:03.835 --> 25:06.041
and he's basically a stranger
to me.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.503
<i>Shayan, how did your uncle's
prints</i>

25:11.538 --> 25:13.602
get on the murder weapon?
- Doesn't matter, man.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.701
I heard you over the phone.

25:16.868 --> 25:18.470
I'm the reason Rameen's dead.

25:18.505 --> 25:20.173
Shayan,
if you're protecting Ali--

25:20.208 --> 25:21.965
I think I should talk
to a lawyer, man.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.503
Donavan:

25:23.538 --> 25:25.503
Dennis: So Rameen's new
gunshot wound

25:25.538 --> 25:28.140
is in the exact same spot
as his old gunshot wound.

25:28.175 --> 25:30.107
What are the odds?

25:30.142 --> 25:32.668
River: Same odds
as me moving to the suburbs?

25:34.538 --> 25:36.107
Okay, look.

25:36.142 --> 25:38.107
I know the 'burbs aren't cool,

25:38.142 --> 25:39.899
but it means a bigger yard.

25:39.934 --> 25:42.569
We could get a dog,
plant a garden.

25:42.604 --> 25:44.701
Have kids one day,
if that's something you want.

25:44.736 --> 25:46.470
Dennis...

25:46.505 --> 25:48.701
the most important thing
for me, right now,

25:48.736 --> 25:51.833
is being close
to my chosen family.

25:51.868 --> 25:53.932
<i>Support. Safety.</i>

25:53.967 --> 25:55.437
<i>Can you understand that?</i>

25:55.472 --> 25:58.470
I do, I do.
I promise I do, but -

25:58.505 --> 26:00.536
and I know this is gonna
sound weird,

26:00.571 --> 26:02.899
so please don't freak out -

26:04.142 --> 26:06.602
being close to my mom
is really important to me.

26:07.604 --> 26:09.602
<i>My whole life,
it was always just us.</i>

26:09.637 --> 26:11.536
<i>She raised me alone.</i>

26:11.571 --> 26:13.800
We even worked together
at the body farm.

26:15.033 --> 26:18.668
My mom is... my community.

26:24.274 --> 26:26.031
What is that?

26:32.142 --> 26:33.833
A hearing aid.

26:46.142 --> 26:48.031
<i>Dennis: No chafing.</i>

26:48.066 --> 26:50.074
No impression marks.

26:52.066 --> 26:54.041
I don't think it's his.

27:00.208 --> 27:01.734
Hmm.

27:03.307 --> 27:05.140
Excuse me, detectives?

27:05.175 --> 27:07.140
These just arrived
from the coroner's office.

27:07.175 --> 27:09.239
It's the shroud Mr. Shirazi's
body was wrapped in

27:09.274 --> 27:11.206
and a hearing aid they found
in the cloth.

27:11.241 --> 27:13.107
<i>I'm heading over to
Mr. Shirazi's apartment now</i>

27:13.142 --> 27:14.734
and I'll let you know
if I find anything.

27:14.769 --> 27:16.602
Thanks, Tina.

27:16.637 --> 27:18.602
Reza was hard of hearing.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.767
I thought maybe he was making
that up to avoid talking to us,

27:20.802 --> 27:22.206
but maybe...

27:22.241 --> 27:24.173
It fell off while
he was wrapping the body.

27:25.802 --> 27:27.668
Maybe Reza didn't appreciate
all the respect

27:27.703 --> 27:29.899
Rameen was getting
from the community?

27:29.934 --> 27:31.767
Ooh.

27:32.769 --> 27:34.305
How are you always hungry?

27:34.340 --> 27:36.140
I just have a hyper-speed
metabolism.

27:36.175 --> 27:38.734
I'm... hashtag blessed.

27:41.736 --> 27:43.569
Blessings.

27:43.604 --> 27:45.140
B-blessings.

27:45.175 --> 27:48.074
How do you even open this thing
is my question?

27:48.109 --> 27:49.833
I guess you could peel it.

27:49.868 --> 27:52.074
One sec, give me the napkin.

27:56.637 --> 27:58.833
It's identical.

27:58.868 --> 28:02.206
They wrapped Rameen's body
in Sara's tablecloth.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.932
So, they were all there
when Rameen died.

28:09.274 --> 28:10.899
Ross: You can get pomegranate molasses

28:10.934 --> 28:12.800
at most Middle Eastern
grocery stores,

28:12.835 --> 28:15.305
so that's never a concern.
Let--

28:15.340 --> 28:17.074
Okay, um...

28:18.066 --> 28:19.371
Mom.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.173
<i>Mom!</i>

28:21.208 --> 28:23.998
Wake up!
- Oh God, I'm sorry.

28:24.033 --> 28:25.668
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

28:25.703 --> 28:27.701
Sorry.
- Um... okay,

28:27.736 --> 28:31.767
and, uh, it has a very sweet
and slightly sour taste.

28:31.802 --> 28:34.305
Okay. Um, so now, we'll...

28:38.703 --> 28:41.031
What's wrong, Bub?

28:41.066 --> 28:43.965
I don't know.
Something's missing.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.173
- Yeah, here, give it to me.
- Something I just can't read.

28:46.208 --> 28:48.173
Sorry about all of the
interruptions right here,

28:48.208 --> 28:51.140
but I just... I just had
to tell ya.

28:51.175 --> 28:53.107
That bedroom up there
is shaping up

28:53.142 --> 28:54.932
to something really fancy.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.272
By the time we get back
from this little trip,

28:58.274 --> 29:01.701
Peggy will not be sleeping
on that couch anymore.

29:01.736 --> 29:03.338
Peggy's sleeping
on the couch?

29:03.373 --> 29:04.800
I didn't...

29:04.835 --> 29:06.866
I didn't know that.

29:06.901 --> 29:08.932
Well, no. It's just the last
couple o' nights

29:08.967 --> 29:12.272
'cause she found, she got
a knot in her back from my bed.

29:12.307 --> 29:15.041
Hmph. Wh-wh-where is Peggy?

29:16.142 --> 29:17.998
Have you seen Peggy?
- Uh, yeah,

29:18.033 --> 29:19.734
she's... in the garden.

29:19.769 --> 29:21.404
Does she even wanna go
on this trip?

29:21.439 --> 29:24.206
Sometimes I'm thinking
she doesn't even wanna go.

29:24.241 --> 29:26.031
She wanted to give your
plants one more watering

29:26.066 --> 29:27.800
before taking off.

29:27.835 --> 29:30.305
She just can't seem
to help herself, can she?

29:30.340 --> 29:32.437
She was making you chicken
soup this morning,

29:32.472 --> 29:34.272
and I didn't have the heart
to tell her

29:34.307 --> 29:36.404
that you're a vegetarian.

29:36.439 --> 29:37.932
Gordon: No, it's okay.

29:37.967 --> 29:39.800
Ross: Okay, um...

29:39.835 --> 29:42.031
Come on up here.

29:42.066 --> 29:43.734
Nope. No, not yet.

29:43.769 --> 29:45.734
<i>I need to uh...</i>

29:45.769 --> 29:47.272
hmmmmmmm.

29:52.802 --> 29:54.833
Well, you're still with me?
Come on, just up here.

29:57.505 --> 29:58.899
Come on in.

30:00.802 --> 30:02.470
Boy, you're a quiet one.

30:02.505 --> 30:04.140
Have you never heard
of small talk?

30:07.505 --> 30:09.074
What're you locking
the door for?

30:14.901 --> 30:17.074
What, w-w-what's happening
to me?!

30:17.109 --> 30:19.107
<i>What's going on?</i>

30:19.142 --> 30:21.800
What the hell is happening
to me?

30:22.802 --> 30:24.503
My God, what's happening?!

30:29.208 --> 30:31.173
You know, I always knew
Rodney was destined

30:31.208 --> 30:32.965
for bigger things
than massage school.

30:36.472 --> 30:38.107
I got it.

30:38.142 --> 30:39.899
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:39.934 --> 30:41.437
Okay, I...

30:41.472 --> 30:43.470
I swear I did not help Grandpa
order this much crap.

30:48.373 --> 30:50.206
- Hey.
- I got the uh...

30:50.241 --> 30:52.932
files you asked for.
- Oh. Thank you.

30:52.967 --> 30:55.899
I-I know, I could've emailed
them, but...

30:55.934 --> 30:58.031
I also wanted to bring
a home remedy smoothie

30:58.066 --> 31:00.140
like my mom used to make
for me.

31:00.175 --> 31:02.140
Oh, thank you.

31:02.175 --> 31:04.437
I'm not, I'm not keeping
much down today.

31:04.472 --> 31:06.635
Hey! Hi!

31:07.637 --> 31:09.569
I am going to go freshen up.

31:09.604 --> 31:11.734
Uh, b-because I'm filming something.

31:17.736 --> 31:19.701
- Oh, and there's this.
- Yeah.

31:22.307 --> 31:24.668
Photocopy of the paper
that was in Rameen's hand.

31:24.703 --> 31:27.173
That is some beautiful penmanship.

31:27.208 --> 31:28.998
So clean and crisp.

31:29.033 --> 31:31.031
My parents made me take Urdu
when I was a kid,

31:31.066 --> 31:32.635
and I could never get the hang
of it.

31:32.670 --> 31:34.031
Well, smudgy writing.

31:34.066 --> 31:35.701
- You're right-handed?
- Yeah.

31:35.736 --> 31:37.031
Yeah, Farsi's written
right to left, too.

31:37.066 --> 31:38.965
David was also right-handed,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.965
so he got a case
of the smudgies.

32:03.175 --> 32:05.338
Rameen's writing
wasn't smudged.

32:07.736 --> 32:09.239
Hey! Uh, River,

32:09.274 --> 32:12.437
I need you to test Rameen's
left hand for GSR.

32:12.472 --> 32:15.140
So... how is it...
how's it going?

32:15.175 --> 32:18.173
Um, better than you,
by the looks of it.

32:18.208 --> 32:21.404
Uh, question.
Did a bomb go off in here?

32:21.439 --> 32:24.031
Oh, uh... yeah, no.

32:24.066 --> 32:26.140
This... this is fine.

32:26.175 --> 32:28.140
Everything...

32:28.175 --> 32:30.338
I am fine.
- Hmm...

32:30.373 --> 32:32.701
'Cause it looks like
you're kinda...

32:32.736 --> 32:34.668
freakin' out.

32:34.703 --> 32:37.173
Okay, yeah, a little.

32:37.208 --> 32:39.305
Look, I'm supposed to be
filming this audition

32:39.340 --> 32:41.074
for a new cooking show, right,

32:41.109 --> 32:43.074
and it has to look slick,
and it has to look cool,

32:43.109 --> 32:44.734
but right now, Mom is so sick

32:44.769 --> 32:46.536
that she can't even hold
the camera straight

32:46.571 --> 32:48.305
and my momaney won't help me
translate recipe notes

32:48.340 --> 32:50.206
that are in Farsi because
I don't have a husband. So...

32:50.241 --> 32:52.536
pretty much this whole thing
is kind of a disaster.

32:53.538 --> 32:55.239
I-I can help out.

32:56.373 --> 32:59.404
I mean, I do owe you
for saving my life...

32:59.439 --> 33:01.470
after almost killing me.

33:01.505 --> 33:03.437
Oh! That's right,

33:04.439 --> 33:06.173
you do owe me!

33:07.175 --> 33:11.173
Uh, but first... you call
your grandma "Momaney"?

33:11.208 --> 33:13.602
Yes. It's hot, right?

33:13.637 --> 33:15.800
Both:

33:15.835 --> 33:18.536
Donovan, there's a few things
that have been bugging me.

33:18.571 --> 33:20.965
One, the entry wound suggests

33:22.208 --> 33:25.404
that the 9mm was pressed up
against his chest, right?

33:25.439 --> 33:27.437
Two, that it's in the exact
same spot

33:27.472 --> 33:29.173
<i>as where he was shot
5 years ago,</i>

33:29.208 --> 33:31.206
<i>and three, River just told me</i>

33:31.241 --> 33:33.239
<i>that Rameen just tested positive</i>

33:33.274 --> 33:36.305
<i>for gunshot residue
on his left hand.</i>

33:36.340 --> 33:38.569
Are you saying Rameen
shot himself?

33:41.241 --> 33:43.305
Yeah, but if Rameen shot himself,

33:43.340 --> 33:45.305
then what were these three
doing?

34:00.208 --> 34:02.206
Have a seat.

34:08.538 --> 34:10.866
<i>Ali's fingerprints were found
on the murder weapon.</i>

34:10.901 --> 34:13.668
<i>Rameen's body was wrapped in
Sara's tablecloth.</i>

34:13.703 --> 34:15.668
Reza's hearing aid was found
with the body.

34:17.241 --> 34:18.800
Now, I'm done guessing.

34:18.835 --> 34:20.668
Either you come clean right now

34:20.703 --> 34:22.371
or Shayan's going to prison
for murder

34:22.406 --> 34:24.206
and you're gonna join him
for obstruction.

34:24.241 --> 34:26.668
All:

34:28.439 --> 34:30.734
<i>Donovan: Enough!</i>

34:30.769 --> 34:32.569
I think I know what happened
last night,

34:32.604 --> 34:34.701
but I need to hear it
from all of you.

34:36.604 --> 34:39.239
You're looking at 7 years
to life for a technicality.

34:39.274 --> 34:41.767
Tell me keeping Rameen's secret
is worth that.

34:50.802 --> 34:52.272
<i>Look, a couple days ago,</i>

34:52.307 --> 34:55.173
<i>Rameen got his one hundredth
job application rejection.</i>

34:55.208 --> 34:57.503
I mean, the guy was a damn
judge back at home,

34:57.538 --> 35:00.272
and here he couldn't get a bite
of a paper-pushing job.

35:01.472 --> 35:03.800
So he'd been kinda distant
ever since.

35:05.307 --> 35:07.239
And... when he called
and cancelled

35:07.274 --> 35:09.272
our Friday tea last night,

35:09.307 --> 35:11.536
I knew something was wrong,

35:12.538 --> 35:14.536
<i>so I went to the park
to find him</i>

35:14.571 --> 35:16.272
and uh...

35:18.736 --> 35:20.503
he had a gun.

35:20.538 --> 35:22.470
Help me! Help me!

35:22.505 --> 35:25.272
Please, he shot himself!
Reza:

35:27.307 --> 35:29.305
Ali:

35:38.439 --> 35:40.668
Rameen!

35:42.373 --> 35:44.701
All: Oh!

35:44.736 --> 35:46.833
Rameen!

35:46.868 --> 35:48.404
Sara:

35:51.736 --> 35:53.503
Reza:

35:55.901 --> 35:57.536
<i>Shayan: He had no family here.</i>

35:58.571 --> 36:00.437
<i>None in Iran.</i>

36:03.670 --> 36:05.734
<i>Reza: But he deserved...</i>

36:05.769 --> 36:08.437
<i>some kind of burial.</i>

36:08.472 --> 36:11.305
<i>We would want the same
in his shoes.</i>

36:46.670 --> 36:48.305
<i>Ali:</i>

37:00.505 --> 37:02.338
Reza: Persian men like Rameen...

37:02.373 --> 37:04.899
doesn't let anyone inside
his struggle.

37:04.934 --> 37:06.503
Too ashamed.

37:07.505 --> 37:10.437
He never become
what he was back home.

37:10.472 --> 37:12.668
<i>I share the same struggle.</i>

37:12.703 --> 37:14.635
He helped us so much,

37:14.670 --> 37:16.734
but when he needed help...

37:16.769 --> 37:19.371
Rameen was too strong
to talk like this.

37:19.406 --> 37:21.404
Yeah, look where
strong got him, Uncle.

37:21.439 --> 37:23.602
He's strong and dead!

37:34.340 --> 37:36.305
We could charge them with
Obstruction of Justice,

37:36.340 --> 37:38.031
but how do you send three
immigrants to prison

37:38.066 --> 37:39.668
for stumbling onto a suicide

37:39.703 --> 37:41.338
and being terrified
of the cops?

37:41.373 --> 37:42.932
I mean, does that sound
like justice?

37:42.967 --> 37:44.503
Well, I doubt we'd find
a Crown

37:44.538 --> 37:46.800
willing to prosecute them
even if we did charge 'em.

37:48.406 --> 37:50.437
Change. Transform.

37:50.472 --> 37:52.404
What do you think
it meant to him?

37:54.901 --> 37:57.569
Hey. Officer Stanley found

37:57.604 --> 37:59.338
a box of 9-mill ammo
in Rameen's nightstand.

37:59.373 --> 38:01.107
They're sending it
to ballistics

38:01.142 --> 38:02.965
so they can match it
to the gun.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.833
They also found this on his
old school answering machine.

38:05.868 --> 38:07.437
<i>Woman: Hello,
Mr. Rameen.</i>

38:07.472 --> 38:09.470
<i>We loved meeting with you,
and we wanted to offer you</i>

38:09.505 --> 38:11.470
<i>the position of legal secretary.</i>

38:11.505 --> 38:13.734
<i>Thank you so much, and we look
forward to working with you.</i>

38:14.967 --> 38:17.107
If only he'd hung in
one more day, uh?

38:17.142 --> 38:19.701
Seems like a painful way
to go.

38:19.736 --> 38:22.470
So, uh, case closed then?

38:23.472 --> 38:25.701
Yeah. They did what
they thought was right.

38:25.736 --> 38:27.437
Would've been a whole lot
easier if they'd trusted us

38:27.472 --> 38:29.107
to start with though.

38:29.142 --> 38:31.635
I did say eat
the pomegranate.

38:33.538 --> 38:35.635
Hey, you wanna grab a beer?

38:35.670 --> 38:37.031
- Hello, gentlemen!
- Uh--

38:37.066 --> 38:39.503
Hey, Cass. Uh...

38:39.538 --> 38:41.701
Malik, Cassidy.
Cassidy, Malik.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.998
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

38:44.033 --> 38:46.437
You ready to go?
- Yeah, my stuff's in the car.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.437
Hey, uh, good work today.

39:03.033 --> 39:04.932
<i>Ross: Hi!
My name is Ross Khalighi.</i>

39:04.967 --> 39:07.140
<i>The meal I'm gonna be preparing
for you</i>

39:07.175 --> 39:09.833
is one of my father's
Persian home dishes.

39:09.868 --> 39:11.635
Now, he died a few years ago,

39:11.670 --> 39:13.899
but he always taught me
to be proud of who I am.

39:13.934 --> 39:16.800
It may not be the most
beautiful-looking dish,

39:16.835 --> 39:20.602
but it is actually
the most delicious.

39:20.637 --> 39:23.767
A stone mortar and pestle
is usually better, but--

39:23.802 --> 39:25.602
What are you doing?
He doesn't want our--

39:25.637 --> 39:27.602
- Oh!
- Okay.

39:27.637 --> 39:29.998
Now--
- Whaddya got on the stove, man?

39:30.033 --> 39:32.206
Both:

39:32.241 --> 39:34.767
It seems we have a few intruders.

39:34.802 --> 39:36.899
Where was I?
Just...

39:36.934 --> 39:38.833
Can you not?! Um, this has to--
- Sorry.

39:38.868 --> 39:40.602
I'll keep people out.

39:40.637 --> 39:42.107
- Thanks.
- You go ahead.

39:42.142 --> 39:44.173
I'm a 20-year-old, queer,
Persian Canadian,

39:44.208 --> 39:45.965
and I am my family -

39:46.000 --> 39:48.569
their messiness,
their big beating hearts.

39:51.571 --> 39:53.602
It's amazing!

39:59.835 --> 40:03.536
I am... I am so sorry.

40:08.769 --> 40:10.536
Happy to help.

40:10.571 --> 40:12.965
And uh...
I think I can...

40:13.000 --> 40:15.602
help you with the translations
as well.

40:15.637 --> 40:17.239
Look.

40:18.241 --> 40:20.536
They're not secrets.
They're just different ways

40:20.571 --> 40:22.932
he adjusted the dishes
to your taste.

40:25.604 --> 40:27.767
Oh my...

40:31.538 --> 40:33.569
Do you wanna get outta here?

40:33.604 --> 40:35.503
Yeah.

40:35.538 --> 40:37.107
Okay.

40:46.033 --> 40:48.965
Ross? Dad?

40:50.066 --> 40:53.569
<i>Gordon: I am gonna break
your skull wide open,</i>

40:53.604 --> 40:56.031
<i>you understand me?!</i>

40:56.066 --> 40:58.140
Idiot!

40:58.175 --> 41:00.866
This numbskull delivery man
is trying to stop me

41:00.901 --> 41:03.305
from taking Peggy up
to the Niagara region.

41:03.340 --> 41:06.140
Okay, Dad. Dad, it's okay,
all right? There's nobody here.

41:06.175 --> 41:08.734
Oh, I know you don't see him,
but I do. I do!

41:08.769 --> 41:10.734
I see you!
- Are you two fighting?

41:10.769 --> 41:12.602
No, I'm fighting
this hallucination

41:12.637 --> 41:14.602
who's trying to stop me
from taking you

41:14.637 --> 41:16.602
up to see the vineyards, okay?
- Okay.

41:16.637 --> 41:18.602
- Jenny, we-we need to leave--
- No, I'm not leaving him--

41:18.637 --> 41:20.602
- Jennifer, please! Now!
- Peggy, stop!

41:20.637 --> 41:22.305
- Ow!
- What?

41:22.340 --> 41:24.965
- Okay.
- Peggy, I barely... I... I...

41:28.769 --> 41:30.338
Dad, hold on.

41:36.142 --> 41:38.569
Peggy. Peggy, can you please
tell me what that was about?

41:38.604 --> 41:40.239
I barely touched you.

41:40.274 --> 41:42.173
Barely. What is this?

41:42.208 --> 41:44.635
A few nights ago, Gordon was
having a hallucination.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.998
He thought I was someone else,
then he grabbed me.

41:47.033 --> 41:48.899
Uh, I-I did that?

41:49.934 --> 41:51.932
I did that? Is that why
you're sleeping on the couch?

41:51.967 --> 41:53.767
It's not your fault,
I know that.

41:53.802 --> 41:56.107
- My God.
- Peggy, why didn't you tell me?

41:56.142 --> 41:57.998
I'm trying to take care
of him.

41:59.066 --> 42:01.734
If I fail at that,
then I'm... I'm...

42:01.769 --> 42:04.074
gonna lose my place
in this family.

42:04.109 --> 42:06.107
No, Peggy, I'm not saying
that you have to be perfect,

42:06.142 --> 42:07.767
but you have to take care
of Dad properly.

42:07.802 --> 42:09.338
Look, if he's having violent
episodes, I--

42:09.373 --> 42:11.272
- I'm not violent!
- Dad, I know you're not--

42:11.307 --> 42:12.965
I mean, all this tiptoeing
around it

42:13.000 --> 42:15.031
is making my dementia
like worse.

42:15.066 --> 42:17.031
I'm trying to be everything

42:17.066 --> 42:18.965
everybody needs me to be,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.239
but it's still not enough,
is it?

42:21.274 --> 42:24.239
It's just... it's fine.
It's just fine.

42:27.066 --> 42:28.767
<i>Peggy's voice: Mommy can't look
at you.</i>

42:28.802 --> 42:31.932
<i>Get her away from me!</i>

42:31.967 --> 42:34.031
<i>I have to go.</i>

42:34.066 --> 42:36.173
<i>I have to...</i>

42:43.373 --> 42:45.239
<i>Gordon: Jenny,
Mommy's just sick.</i>

42:45.274 --> 42:47.107
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

42:58.033 --> 42:59.965
Jenny!

43:00.000 --> 43:02.998
There you go.
