11:17.927 --> 11:19.178
The other side.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.971
-[Willowdean] Whoops.
-[Rosie] Oh!

11:21.055 --> 11:23.099
-Okay, darlin', just grab my ankles.
-Uh-huh.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.517
-Okay.
-Okay. Mm-hmm.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.434
Good. Okay.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.435
Oh, God.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.770
-[Rosie] Okay?
-[Ellen] Okay.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.271
-Here.
-All right. I got it.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.815
-Okay.
-All right.

11:30.898 --> 11:31.941
Did I hit my...

11:32.024 --> 11:32.858
Okay.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.194
Thank you, Ellen.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.071
-You're welcome.
-I'm sorry.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.115
-Will you hold that, please, for a second?
-Mm-hmm.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.032
[exhales]

11:40.408 --> 11:41.409
Oh, my gosh.

11:42.034 --> 11:42.910
Thank you.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.912
Wow, you really just parked...

11:45.454 --> 11:47.248
Well, there are no spots.

11:47.331 --> 11:48.958
[Rosie] I mean, my gosh...

11:49.041 --> 11:51.794
-[man] Runner up: Miss Coolie Simmons.
-[Rosie gasps]

11:51.877 --> 11:54.046
Oh, my gosh, it's starting already.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.381
Oh.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.507
[applause]

11:57.341 --> 11:58.175
[sighs]

11:59.260 --> 12:00.136
I just...

12:00.469 --> 12:02.263
I just wish they all could win.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.265
They work so hard.

12:05.307 --> 12:08.811
Yes. Walking is so, so hard.

12:08.894 --> 12:09.895
[applause]

12:10.604 --> 12:12.273
Miss Teen Bluebonnet.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.817
Oh, Miss Teen Sweetwater!

12:14.900 --> 12:16.026
Oh, my Lord, look at you.

12:16.110 --> 12:19.447
-You haven't aged a minute.
-Oh, it's the backstage lighting.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.198
Thank you so much for making the trip.

12:21.282 --> 12:25.035
Oh, please. I would've driven
a million miles to support those girls.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.496
It's just such a nice treat
to have a special guest.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.957
That audience is plum tired
of seeing my face out there.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.752
[Rosie and Delia laugh]

12:32.835 --> 12:34.003
Really, trust me.

12:34.712 --> 12:38.758
My, it looks like
the Miss America pageant out there.

12:38.841 --> 12:39.800
Thank you.

12:40.217 --> 12:43.262
Those backdrops really give
our social media a nice pop.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.723
-Social media?
-Yeah. Hashtag pop.

12:45.806 --> 12:46.640
Oh!

12:46.724 --> 12:49.185
Hoping to give you Bluebonnets
a run for your money this year

12:49.268 --> 12:50.853
in that Best Pageant award.
Look out!

12:50.936 --> 12:54.064
Oh, well.
Best keep an eye on those hemlines then.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.609
-'Cause they're looking a little short.
-Well.

12:56.692 --> 12:57.568
[Rosie chuckles]

12:57.651 --> 12:59.403
This must be your daughter.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.655
Oh, no. That's Ellen,
my daughter's best friend.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.699
This is my daughter, Willowdean.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.951
Wow. Okay.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.620
So nice to meet you both.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.246
-So great meeting you too.
-Both of you.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.081
-Nice to meet you.
-[man] And now your host...

13:11.165 --> 13:12.708
-Delia Shepherd.
-Okay, gotta go.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.834
Okay. Have fun.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.086
-[applause]
-So exciting.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.588
[cheering and whistling]

13:20.424 --> 13:21.425
Good evening.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.552
-It is my special duty...
-Oh.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.722
...to introduce
a very special guest tonight.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.766
To crown this year's Miss Teen Sweetwater,

13:28.849 --> 13:33.187
my fellow former, and the director
of the Bluebonnet pageant,

13:33.270 --> 13:36.482
ten-time recipient
of the best Texas pageant award,

13:36.649 --> 13:40.820
please welcome Clover City's
Miss Teen 1991,

13:40.903 --> 13:43.823
Miss Rosie Dickson.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.282
[cheers and applause]

13:47.952 --> 13:48.786
[Rosie] Well...

13:49.328 --> 13:50.913
Thank you, Miss Delia.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.582
And girls, might I just say,

13:53.958 --> 13:56.252
y'all look stunning tonight.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.172
-[applause]
-It is my honor to introduce you

14:00.256 --> 14:05.052
to your new Miss Teen Sweetwater...

14:05.135 --> 14:07.888
Miss Darlene Williams.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.640
[cheers and applause]

14:10.683 --> 14:12.059
Come on, girl.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.437
Beautiful!

14:27.491 --> 14:28.951
[inaudible]

14:33.205 --> 14:34.748
[applause]

14:36.917 --> 14:39.003
[Rosie] I mean, she's just so stunning!

14:42.756 --> 14:44.884
[Eugene] Clover City's KQRK,
I'm Eugene Reed,

14:44.967 --> 14:47.386
your host of all the hits,
reminding listeners to sign up

14:47.469 --> 14:50.097
for the 85th annual
Miss Teen Bluebonnet pageant.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.307
It's just around the corner.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.461
[men laughing]

15:22.504 --> 15:24.173
[people chatting in the distance]

15:25.925 --> 15:27.760
Come on in. I'll cook you
a burger or something.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.219
-Gotta roll.
-Good to see you.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.055
-All right.
-Good to see you. Have a good one.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.097
[girl] Bye, Bo.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.307
[horn honks]

15:35.351 --> 15:36.602
Hey, where are you going?

15:39.063 --> 15:39.897
Hi.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.523
So...

15:42.066 --> 15:44.234
Those are your rich
prep school friends, hey?

15:44.818 --> 15:47.613
Y'all are so lucky you have
two more weeks left of summer.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.199
You know, not everyone who goes
to Holy Cross is rich.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.368
No, I didn't mean it like that. I just...

15:52.826 --> 15:54.578
You know, like, rich or poor,

15:54.662 --> 15:57.873
we all have to deal with the same
"prepare for the future" thing.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.208
Like...

15:59.625 --> 16:02.169
Kind of like we're supposed to have
some big plan mapped out,

16:02.252 --> 16:03.796
when most of the adults in this town

16:03.879 --> 16:06.465
don't even know what they want to be
when they grow up, so...

16:06.840 --> 16:08.050
[dumpster door closes]

16:09.426 --> 16:10.803
If only they had a Magic 8-Ball.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.682
[Willowdean] Hmm.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.310
Thanks, by the way.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.770
Weirdly, I...

16:20.396 --> 16:21.981
always wanted one of these.

16:22.064 --> 16:22.898
[chuckles]

16:25.442 --> 16:27.611
[Bo sighs]

16:28.570 --> 16:30.948
[Bo] Did we poison table seven yesterday?

16:32.616 --> 16:33.450
[both laugh]

16:34.076 --> 16:36.328
Well, I guess we'd better send flowers.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.498
Come on.

16:39.581 --> 16:40.791
Better get back to work.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.469
[tape creaking]

17:03.647 --> 17:04.940
[gasps] Oh, my stars.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.026
You scared me.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.486
[Rosie sighs]

17:12.239 --> 17:14.867
[Willowdean]
That was one of Lucy's favorite dresses.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.370
Dumplin', I don't want to talk
about this right now.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.998
We agreed that we would do this
before the end of summer.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.751
Mom, she's been gone six months.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.836
When can we talk about her?

17:29.673 --> 17:31.884
What are you planning on doing
with everything?

17:33.552 --> 17:34.803
Well, I don't-- I mean...

17:36.096 --> 17:37.765
I guess we'll donate most of it.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.392
She was such a pack rat.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.645
[sighs] We've just got to make room.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.230
Room for what?

17:45.314 --> 17:49.068
Without Lucy's extra income,
I am gonna have to start doing alterations

17:49.151 --> 17:50.652
so that we can make ends meet.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.530
You mean alterations for the pageant?

17:55.824 --> 17:56.784
Yes, Willowdean.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.911
For the pageant.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.501
Yeah, well,

18:06.085 --> 18:09.338
I want to look through everything
before it gets donated.

18:13.842 --> 18:14.760
Yes, ma'am.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.513
Will, come on.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.014
Aren't you ready?

18:19.807 --> 18:22.476
I don't want to be late.
It's our first day of school.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.436
[scoffs] You're still asleep?

18:25.896 --> 18:27.648
Are you threatening to move out?

18:29.817 --> 18:30.734
[Willowdean sighs]

18:30.818 --> 18:32.945
My mom's packing up Lucy's room.

18:34.279 --> 18:37.282
Mmm. Well, you should keep
as much of it as you want.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.245
I really want to find that bee brooch
of hers. I loved that.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.455
Yeah, reminds me of her, too.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.208
You know, that little bit of flair
she always had.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.004
Hmm.

18:52.047 --> 18:52.881
When'd you get this?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.174
[sighs]

18:54.258 --> 18:55.884
Prep school Bo gave it to me.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.637
You know that means he likes you, right?

18:59.471 --> 19:00.806
He does not.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.476
He's... nice to everybody. He just...

19:04.560 --> 19:06.270
-I don't know, he's just like that.
-Mm-hmm.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.147
So he gave everybody one of these?

19:09.022 --> 19:10.607
Okay, Will. Um...

19:11.483 --> 19:14.194
Boys don't give girls
sweet little presents

19:14.278 --> 19:17.447
unless they're trying
to get their attention. That's a fact.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.491
Elle...

19:19.867 --> 19:21.994
boys like Bo don't date girls like me.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.537
That's a fact.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.372
Look, he just wants to be friends

19:25.455 --> 19:28.292
so he can ask me questions
about girls he actually likes.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.086
Is that true?

19:33.255 --> 19:34.089
Mmm.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.216
"My sources say no." Told you.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.510
Look, I can't be late.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.595
I'll meet you there.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.222
[Rosie] Dumplin', you're gonna be late.

19:42.848 --> 19:46.018
Well, Sweetwater is working hard
to keep up with the times.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.769
Which is a fool's errand if you ask me.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.730
[woman] I know, but it is worth it.

19:49.813 --> 19:50.731
Mm-hmm.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.233
-[woman on phone continues indistinctly]
-Mm-hmm.

19:53.984 --> 19:54.860
Oh, hold on a sec.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.445
Honey, I made extra.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.448
It's okay. I'm just gonna take a banana
so I'm not late.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.490
Why...

20:00.574 --> 20:02.951
-All right, have a great first day.
-Thanks.

20:03.035 --> 20:03.869
[door opens]

20:05.621 --> 20:06.580
[sighs]

20:07.247 --> 20:09.124
-Anyway, all's I was saying is...
-[door closes]

20:09.208 --> 20:13.212
these city pageants are just getting
more and more generic every year.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.797
-[car engine splutters]
-I mean, there's nothing Texas about 'em.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.633
It's like they just popped up
out of nowhere.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.135
[woman] Yeah, I agree.
But the thing is, if we talk to her,

20:20.219 --> 20:23.055
she might be able to get us
a few extra decorations.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.765
-Oh, Lord.
-[car engine spluttering]

20:24.848 --> 20:26.642
-I'm gonna have to call you back.
-All right.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.602
[groans]

20:28.685 --> 20:31.563
[Rosie] Well, I don't care
how popular she is.

20:31.647 --> 20:35.025
We are not doing a Beyoncé song
for the opening number.

20:35.108 --> 20:39.238
Our bylaws strictly outline the lyrics
and music deemed appropriate.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.573
It is my job to uphold those guidelines...

20:41.657 --> 20:44.326
-[woman] Uh-huh.
-...however unpopular it makes me.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.827
-I agree.
-Okay, hold on one second.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.580
All right, honey,
I'm gonna call Joe's Garage,

20:48.664 --> 20:51.458
get your car towed,
and we'll find out what's wrong, okay?

20:51.541 --> 20:52.501
Thank you.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.170
[Rosie] I don't wanna hear
the name Beyoncé anymore.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.172
So, anyway... Oh, Dumplin'!

20:57.256 --> 20:58.215
[boy] No way!

20:58.298 --> 20:59.466
[Rosie] Dumplin'!

20:59.549 --> 21:01.385
[boy] Yeah, Dumplin'.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.637
Forgot your phone.

21:03.720 --> 21:04.596
[girl] Dumplin'?

21:04.680 --> 21:05.931
[all laughing]

21:14.439 --> 21:15.732
Well, you're welcome.

21:19.736 --> 21:20.696
So sorry.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.323
[girl] What does that even mean?

21:23.407 --> 21:24.908
[boy] Call me little dumplin'.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.493
-[kids laughing]
-What just happened?

21:26.576 --> 21:28.328
My mom just happened.

21:28.996 --> 21:29.913
[school bell rings]

21:29.997 --> 21:33.417
Oh, God. Everybody heard.
It was so embarrassing, Elle.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.378
Here comes Dumplin'!

21:36.461 --> 21:38.171
Just ignore him, he's an idiot.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.924
-Oh, dude, it's Millie.
-Whoops!

21:41.341 --> 21:43.218
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

21:43.302 --> 21:45.220
Guess they need to widen the hallways.

21:45.762 --> 21:48.223
[boys laugh]

21:48.807 --> 21:50.267
[Ellen] Millie, you okay?

21:51.018 --> 21:52.853
-[boy grunts]
-[kids gasp]

21:53.353 --> 21:55.314
[boy groans]

21:55.689 --> 21:56.732
Good aim.

21:57.941 --> 21:59.443
[grunts, whimpers]

22:03.322 --> 22:06.491
[Rosie] Suspended
because of indecent violence?

22:06.575 --> 22:08.910
I've never heard of such a thing.
What is wrong with you?

22:08.994 --> 22:11.705
-Me? It's your fault.
-My fault?

22:11.788 --> 22:13.915
I was just defending myself
against a bully

22:13.999 --> 22:17.002
who was calling me that hideous nickname
you've been calling me my whole life.

22:17.085 --> 22:19.087
-He deserved it.
-Have a lovely day, Miss Dickson.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.672
Why, you, too, Miss Hall.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.591
Listen to me, young lady.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.802
Why are you getting all sensitive
about a silly little nickname?

22:25.886 --> 22:29.306
Mom, we know this is about
so much more than just a nickname.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.391
You'll never come out and say it,

22:31.475 --> 22:34.019
but I know you can't stand
that your daughter looks like this.

22:34.102 --> 22:36.229
-What?
-Like a round little dumpling.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.522
Oh, that is not true.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.816
-Oh, please. I don't fit in your world.
-That is not true.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.610
-I get it.
-Listen, I just want you

22:41.693 --> 22:43.612
to have opportunities, all right?

22:43.695 --> 22:45.364
It is harder for big girls.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.990
I was one, I know.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.992
Okay? Luce and I both were.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.702
-You know that.
-Yeah, I've heard the story

22:50.786 --> 22:53.914
about how you lost the weight the summer
before high school and Lucy didn't,

22:53.997 --> 22:55.916
and you went on to win
the Miss Teen pageant,

22:55.999 --> 22:58.752
quite literally
your last crowning achievement.

22:58.835 --> 23:01.421
Watch your tone with me, young lady.
I am still your mother.

23:02.005 --> 23:02.881
For the record,

23:02.964 --> 23:04.800
we both know who raised me,

23:04.883 --> 23:07.344
and she never once
made me feel bad about myself.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.597
I really wish
you didn't idolize her so much.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.975
If she took better care of herself,
she'd probably still be here.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.770
You were always so focused on her weight.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.731
You never even really
got to know who she was.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.191
Do you even miss her?

23:22.067 --> 23:24.361
Forget it. I'm walking home.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.369
Well, I am sorry

23:32.452 --> 23:35.414
that I didn't get to go
to all your Dolly Parton parties

23:35.497 --> 23:38.583
because I had to go to work
to put a roof over your head,

23:38.667 --> 23:40.293
because that's what mothers do.

What're you doing?

Look at this.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.057
Lucy never said a word.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.017
Looks like she thought
about doing the pageant,

25:19.100 --> 25:20.852
but she obviously didn't feel welcome

25:20.936 --> 25:24.189
with people like my mom
lording over it with their measuring tape.

What's going on?

and do what Lucy never could.

Are you trying to get back at me

I'd sign up for the pageant

33:09.153 --> 33:11.698

by the female psyche.

-In other words...

33:16.494 --> 33:17.829
We're Spartacus...

33:17.912 --> 33:20.164
and the pageant is the Roman Empire.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.379
Anybody?

33:28.965 --> 33:31.467
-Okay, okay. Hey.
-Oh, no.

33:33.469 --> 33:35.680
Every revolution starts small.

33:36.055 --> 33:37.724
I don't want to revolt.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.728
I've wanted to do this pageant
since I was eight years old.

33:43.271 --> 33:46.274
[Ellen] Okay, Millie,
I think what everybody's trying to say

33:46.357 --> 33:49.986
is that yes, we are still
technically doing the pageant,

33:50.570 --> 33:52.697
and it'll still be fun. It's just...

33:53.239 --> 33:54.115
[Bo] Your drinks.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.409
[Ellen] You know,
I think you should pull back a bit.

33:56.492 --> 34:00.705
Maybe a little bit more than a bit.
Like... way back.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.415
Okay, then.

34:03.583 --> 34:04.500
Good meeting.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.045
Oh.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.715
And let me know when you're ready
to take this thing down.

34:12.800 --> 34:13.718
[Willowdean sighs]

34:14.719 --> 34:16.763
Okay, Millie, you can show me
your binder now,

34:16.846 --> 34:19.557
but after that
we have to put it away, okay?

34:20.349 --> 34:21.350
Okay.

34:21.851 --> 34:25.730
Well, I made yours yellow
because you remind me of sunshine.

34:25.938 --> 34:28.649
-Aw!
-So, for your talent, I was thinking...

34:33.029 --> 34:34.781
[Bo] Can I give you a hand with those?

34:37.033 --> 34:38.367
-Here.
-I got it.

34:39.911 --> 34:40.787
Thank you.

34:44.916 --> 34:45.750
Hey.

34:46.834 --> 34:49.504
There's a, uh...
small meteor shower tonight.

if you're into that sort of thing, but...

34:52.632 --> 34:55.343

36:05.413 --> 36:06.247

36:06.956 --> 36:11.210
She's, like, one of the greatest
singer-songwriters of all time.

36:11.460 --> 36:13.171

want to kiss me?

1:12:27.843 --> 1:12:30.846
speak clearly 'cause you never get
a second chance at a first impression.

1:12:30.929 --> 1:12:33.515
Be brief 'cause it shows
a sign of confidence.

1:12:33.599 --> 1:12:36.477
And avoid using "like" and "um"
'cause it makes us sound ignorant.

1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:37.895
And speak from experience

1:12:37.978 --> 1:12:40.356
'cause it shows you've lived a life
worth paying attention to.

1:12:40.439 --> 1:12:42.608
-[Hannah groans]
-Those are all Rosie-isms.

1:12:43.192 --> 1:12:45.694
Oh, public speaking makes me want to barf.

1:12:46.070 --> 1:12:46.904
Okay.

1:12:47.237 --> 1:12:48.697
Come on, tough guy.

1:12:48.781 --> 1:12:49.656
[giggling]

1:12:49.740 --> 1:12:50.824
[applause]

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:52.076
[girl] Yeah!

1:12:54.745 --> 1:12:55.788
Hello?

1:12:56.163 --> 1:13:00.876
Good morning, girls,
and welcome to the preliminary event.

1:13:01.418 --> 1:13:06.215
I would like to introduce to you
your esteemed panel of judges.

1:13:06.298 --> 1:13:10.177
Miss Tabitha Herrera from Tabitha Salons,

1:13:10.260 --> 1:13:13.055
-elevating hair for over two decades.
-[applause]

1:13:14.181 --> 1:13:16.100
And Mr. Clay Dooley

1:13:16.183 --> 1:13:17.684
of Clay Dooley Chevy,

1:13:17.768 --> 1:13:19.895
where value meets quality.

1:13:20.145 --> 1:13:21.605
[applause]

1:13:21.688 --> 1:13:23.357
And Burgundy Herrer.

1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:26.193
Once a Miss Teen herself,

1:13:26.276 --> 1:13:29.655
who now graces the halls of Century 21.

1:13:29.738 --> 1:13:30.823
[applause]

1:13:33.117 --> 1:13:36.370
So I will hand it over now to our judges

1:13:36.453 --> 1:13:40.958
who will be randomly selecting names
and questions for our contestants.

1:13:41.458 --> 1:13:42.334
Thank you.

1:13:42.418 --> 1:13:43.544
[applause]

1:13:46.547 --> 1:13:48.382
Miss Willowdean Dickson.

1:13:51.176 --> 1:13:52.719
[sniffles, clears throat]

1:13:52.803 --> 1:13:54.388
[Millie whispers] You got this.

1:13:56.223 --> 1:13:57.266
[sighs] Okay.

1:13:58.058 --> 1:13:59.560
[woman speaks indistinctly]

1:14:10.070 --> 1:14:12.281
[Burgundy]
Our question for you today is...

1:14:12.865 --> 1:14:15.075
How would you define loyalty?

1:14:18.579 --> 1:14:19.413
Um...

1:14:20.372 --> 1:14:21.540
Loyalty.

1:14:26.837 --> 1:14:29.715
Loyalty means never giving up on someone,

1:14:29.923 --> 1:14:31.800
even through doubts and differences.

1:14:32.217 --> 1:14:33.510
It's a noun...

1:14:34.303 --> 1:14:35.345
with action,

1:14:36.346 --> 1:14:38.307
fueled by shared experiences,

1:14:38.390 --> 1:14:40.392
which are memorable,

1:14:41.018 --> 1:14:42.227
meaningful,

1:14:43.270 --> 1:14:44.480
and irreplaceable.

1:14:47.024 --> 1:14:48.650
But loyalty isn't blind love.

1:14:50.694 --> 1:14:52.404
It shouldn't be taken for granted.

1:14:53.572 --> 1:14:55.491
Loyalty means telling someone

1:14:55.908 --> 1:14:57.993
when they're wrong when no one else will.

1:14:59.453 --> 1:15:02.915
And loyalty means apologizing
when you're wrong,

1:15:03.457 --> 1:15:05.751
because of the trust
you've built over time.

1:15:12.341 --> 1:15:14.051
Loyalty is true friendship.

1:15:20.349 --> 1:15:21.683
Thank you, Miss Dickson.

1:15:22.518 --> 1:15:24.186
[applause]

1:15:24.269 --> 1:15:26.522
[whistling and cheering]

1:15:27.397 --> 1:15:28.440
[Hannah laughs]

1:15:31.527 --> 1:15:34.238
Ladies, please find the station
with your name on it.

1:15:34.821 --> 1:15:37.324
-[Millie] Where's my name, where is it?
-Get yourselves settled.

1:15:37.407 --> 1:15:38.408
[Millie] Oh, there it is.

1:15:38.492 --> 1:15:40.410
If you have any questions,
I'm here to help.

1:15:42.538 --> 1:15:43.830
[girls chattering]

1:15:45.207 --> 1:15:47.668
[woman] All right, girls.
We have the space.

1:15:50.837 --> 1:15:51.922
It's just a word.

1:15:52.548 --> 1:15:55.008
It doesn't mean anything
unless you let it, but...

1:15:55.968 --> 1:15:57.719
if it hurts you, it hurts me.

1:15:58.554 --> 1:15:59.596
I'm sorry.

1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:00.639
Me too.

1:16:01.139 --> 1:16:03.684
I was wrong to think you weren't built
for the revolution.

1:16:03.767 --> 1:16:04.810
Damn straight.

1:16:04.893 --> 1:16:07.312
This booty can do more damage
than you think.

1:16:07.646 --> 1:16:09.273
[laughing]

1:16:13.610 --> 1:16:15.070
I missed you.

1:16:15.153 --> 1:16:16.989
Oh, and I missed you, too.

1:16:17.823 --> 1:16:21.034
I'm sorry.
I really do want to stop judging.

1:16:22.035 --> 1:16:24.371
I promise. I just...

1:16:25.664 --> 1:16:27.499
I know everyone has their own story.

1:16:28.250 --> 1:16:29.793
Even Callie.

1:16:30.085 --> 1:16:32.713
And if you guys wanna be friends,
I understand--

1:16:32.796 --> 1:16:34.965
Okay. Willowdean Opal Dickson.

1:16:35.549 --> 1:16:39.136
You are my best friend,
and you always will be.

1:16:40.887 --> 1:16:43.557
You're not still doing
that sketchy water bottle trick, are you?

1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:46.435
Hey, I have a few tricks up my sleeve.

1:16:47.102 --> 1:16:50.689
Although, I sure could use your help
in pulling them off.

1:16:50.772 --> 1:16:54.901
-Well, viva la revolucion, baby.
-Oh, I missed you!

1:16:54.985 --> 1:16:55.944
I missed you!

1:16:56.028 --> 1:17:01.825
♪ Like a fool, I'm holding on
To you-ooh-ooh-ooh ♪

1:17:01.908 --> 1:17:04.620
♪ You-ooh-ooh-ooh ♪

1:17:04.995 --> 1:17:06.872

1:17:06.955 --> 1:17:09.416
[Eugene] Hope you got your tickets
for tonight's sold-out event,

1:17:09.499 --> 1:17:11.501
the 85th annual
Miss Teen Bluebonnet pageant.

1:17:11.585 --> 1:17:13.378
Who is gonna be crowned
this year's winner?

1:17:13.462 --> 1:17:15.839
I'll be your host, Eugene Reed.
See you tonight.

1:17:16.131 --> 1:17:17.966
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:17:18.050 --> 1:17:19.593
See you later at the show.

1:17:19.968 --> 1:17:21.219
Okay. Bye.

1:17:27.517 --> 1:17:28.560
Hi.

1:17:37.778 --> 1:17:39.154
Is everything okay?

1:17:41.740 --> 1:17:42.866
Well, you were right.

1:17:44.910 --> 1:17:46.370
I never really got to know...

1:17:47.412 --> 1:17:48.664
all of who she was.

1:17:53.126 --> 1:17:54.836
I don't-- I don't understand this.

1:18:00.300 --> 1:18:02.969
I mean, Lucy was the most confident.

1:18:06.098 --> 1:18:07.057
Her confidence...

1:18:07.724 --> 1:18:08.767
scared me.

1:18:10.143 --> 1:18:11.478
I just can't imagine...

1:18:12.938 --> 1:18:15.065
her to want to do something
and not do it.

1:18:20.237 --> 1:18:21.154
Oh...

1:18:22.447 --> 1:18:23.740
But the dress.

1:18:26.201 --> 1:18:28.078
The year that I won the pageant,

1:18:28.412 --> 1:18:29.788
we didn't have any money...

1:18:30.539 --> 1:18:31.873
to get me a new dress.

1:18:32.999 --> 1:18:33.959
So Lucy...

1:18:34.835 --> 1:18:38.880
helped me find one, very last minute,
at the thrift store.

1:18:38.964 --> 1:18:40.966
And she...

1:18:41.466 --> 1:18:43.844
just insisted...

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:46.179
on staying up all night

1:18:46.930 --> 1:18:49.808
to work on it, even though I told her,
I said, "It's fine.

1:18:50.350 --> 1:18:52.185
It's fine. It fits fine.

1:18:52.644 --> 1:18:55.313
No one's gonna notice
a few missing sequins."

1:18:56.314 --> 1:18:57.357
I said that.

1:19:02.738 --> 1:19:03.905
And the next morning...

1:19:04.865 --> 1:19:07.159
when she handed it back to me, she said,

1:19:08.994 --> 1:19:09.953
"In life...

1:19:11.204 --> 1:19:13.582
the difference
between winning and losing...

1:19:15.333 --> 1:19:16.585
is all in the details."

1:19:20.505 --> 1:19:21.673
That was her.

1:19:24.801 --> 1:19:26.136
[inhales deeply]

1:19:26.553 --> 1:19:27.888
Lucy taught me that.

1:19:30.974 --> 1:19:32.726
You never told me that before.

1:19:40.442 --> 1:19:41.401
Where are they?

1:19:43.570 --> 1:19:44.529
They?

1:19:46.448 --> 1:19:49.117
Her-- the boxes. Lucy's boxes.
Where are they?

1:19:49.576 --> 1:19:50.535
Oh...

1:19:52.245 --> 1:19:54.456
Well... I donated 'em.

1:20:03.256 --> 1:20:04.090
[inhales deeply]

1:20:04.174 --> 1:20:05.008
Oh.

1:20:05.258 --> 1:20:07.385
I think I gave too much of her away.

1:20:13.975 --> 1:20:15.018
[gasping]

1:20:15.101 --> 1:20:15.977
Ooh.

1:20:26.947 --> 1:20:27.823
Mom?

1:20:32.828 --> 1:20:33.870
[girls murmuring]

1:20:34.371 --> 1:20:36.540
[woman] Okay, girls, opening numbers.

1:20:36.957 --> 1:20:40.585
Costumes, hats, boots.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1:20:40.669 --> 1:20:41.503
[giggling]

1:20:44.047 --> 1:20:45.048
[woman] Millie!

1:20:47.467 --> 1:20:50.595
Millicent Amethyst Mitchellchuck!

1:20:51.012 --> 1:20:52.264
[gasps]

1:20:53.348 --> 1:20:54.349
What's up?

1:20:54.432 --> 1:20:55.684
I'm not sure.

1:20:55.976 --> 1:20:56.977
Oh.

1:20:57.310 --> 1:20:59.312
-Oh what?
-[Hannah] She doesn't know. Remember?

1:20:59.938 --> 1:21:02.440
You lied to me? You just lied?

1:21:02.524 --> 1:21:04.568
You lied straight to my face?

1:21:04.943 --> 1:21:06.570
You-- Needlepoint Club?

1:21:06.653 --> 1:21:07.571
Sorry.

1:21:07.654 --> 1:21:08.989
Is this who you are?

1:21:13.493 --> 1:21:14.911
-But...
-What?

1:21:14.995 --> 1:21:17.914
You were wrong
for saying no when I asked.

1:21:18.623 --> 1:21:21.042
I get that you were just trying
to protect me,

1:21:21.126 --> 1:21:24.212
but sometimes I need you to support me.

1:21:24.296 --> 1:21:27.716
All right, well, that is private,
and we will discuss that in the car

1:21:27.799 --> 1:21:28.967
on the way home.

1:21:29.384 --> 1:21:30.927
No, Mrs. Mitchellchuck?

1:21:31.219 --> 1:21:32.053
Um...

1:21:32.137 --> 1:21:33.388
Millie has to compete.

1:21:34.139 --> 1:21:36.975
She's worked so hard for this
and she really deserves it.

1:21:37.434 --> 1:21:38.810
She's not fragile.

1:21:39.352 --> 1:21:41.938
She's got this thick skin
you wouldn't even expect.

1:21:42.898 --> 1:21:46.818
And you know she's been dreaming of doing
the pageant since she was eight years old.

1:21:48.069 --> 1:21:49.029
Is that true?

1:21:51.531 --> 1:21:54.910
There's nothing in the rules
that says big girls need not apply.

1:22:04.044 --> 1:22:05.795
I have one thing to say to you.

1:22:14.429 --> 1:22:15.639
How much wood...

1:22:17.098 --> 1:22:18.975
could a Mitchellchuck chuck...

1:22:19.976 --> 1:22:22.354
if a Mitchellchuck could chuck wood?

1:22:23.855 --> 1:22:26.608
As much wood
as a Mitchellchuck could chuck

1:22:26.691 --> 1:22:28.944
if a Mitchellchuck could chuck wood.

1:22:30.946 --> 1:22:32.405
[Millie's mom] Okay.
[sobs]

1:22:32.489 --> 1:22:35.158
I'm sorry, but you can't lie to me.
You just cannot.

1:22:35.241 --> 1:22:37.369
-[Millie] I won't, Mama.
-Is that a yes?

1:22:38.036 --> 1:22:38.995
Yes, it's a yes.

1:22:39.496 --> 1:22:40.413
[laughs]

1:22:40.997 --> 1:22:41.915
Come on.

1:22:42.791 --> 1:22:43.667
A question.

1:22:44.292 --> 1:22:46.211
Who the heck did your hair and makeup?

1:22:46.294 --> 1:22:48.254
Oh, it's a long story, Mom.

1:22:48.338 --> 1:22:50.757
-I'll tell you later.
-[Millie's mom] I don't wanna know.

1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:52.175
[crowd chattering]

1:22:52.884 --> 1:22:54.761
[clears throat] I'm very excited.

1:22:56.805 --> 1:22:59.140
[Eugene] Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor

1:22:59.224 --> 1:23:04.145
to welcome you to Clover City's
85th annual Miss Teen Bluebonnet pageant.

1:23:04.229 --> 1:23:07.273
Please put your hands together
for this year's contestants.

1:23:07.357 --> 1:23:08.692

1:24:20.055 --> 1:24:21.347
And let's get a round of applause

1:24:21.431 --> 1:24:24.476
for these lovely, beautiful,
coordinated contestants.

1:24:24.976 --> 1:24:27.062
Let's give it up to Miss Rosie Dickson

1:24:27.145 --> 1:24:29.856
and her beautiful homage
to this year's theme:

1:24:30.273 --> 1:24:31.900
Texas, ain't she grand?

1:24:31.983 --> 1:24:33.109
[cheering]

1:24:33.193 --> 1:24:35.153
She is grand, Rosie, and so are you.

1:24:35.236 --> 1:24:37.155
And a good kisser.
Hah! Just kidding.

1:24:37.781 --> 1:24:38.615
Ain't she?

1:24:38.948 --> 1:24:40.658
Yes, she is. Once again...

1:24:41.076 --> 1:24:43.161
Okay, girls. Lifestyle and fitness.

1:24:43.244 --> 1:24:44.412
Let's take our places.

1:24:44.662 --> 1:24:47.373
Make sure your tapes
are in the right places, ladies.

1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:53.713
[Eugene] Everyone gets a Chevy
