00:04.425 --> 00:06.216
Previously, on Beyond...

00:06.217 --> 00:08.218
So do you remember anything
from your coma?

00:08.219 --> 00:09.679
You have to remember.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.092
Your memories are trying
to force their way out.

00:12.093 --> 00:13.133
I'm meeting with Frost.

00:13.134 --> 00:14.594
You had a meeting with Frost?

00:14.595 --> 00:16.726
Now you have a meeting with me.

00:16.727 --> 00:19.139
Jamie, hey.
How about dinner tomorrow?

00:19.140 --> 00:21.141
- Dinner sounds great.
- I will see you then.

00:21.142 --> 00:25.195
Kevin's missing. And I know this
guy is somehow responsible.

00:25.196 --> 00:26.147
Whatever happened
to your friend,

00:26.148 --> 00:27.647
he brought that upon himself.

00:27.648 --> 00:29.530
You're lying!
You killed him!

00:31.742 --> 00:34.074
The old man doesn't have
the best track record.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.246
Have you ever asked him
what happened with the others?

00:36.247 --> 00:37.708
Please work.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.505
Did something happen?

00:45.506 --> 00:47.047
You could say that.

00:53.134 --> 00:55.765
The trick is to sort
as few piles as possible.

00:55.766 --> 00:57.677
Gray is basically white.

00:57.678 --> 01:00.101
Same with tan, orange, yellow.

01:01.182 --> 01:03.144
Hang on.
Take a whiff of those.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.565
Let me know if they reek.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.817
In no universe
am I smelling your jeans.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.320
Ideally, you never
want to wash denim.

01:10.781 --> 01:12.243
See, they're fine.

01:16.867 --> 01:20.541
Hey, hey! Removing somebody's wet
clothes is like a cardinal sin.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.206
Dude.

01:26.207 --> 01:29.629
Didn't know bras could
look that... complicated.

01:29.630 --> 01:32.051
College is all about
liberal education.

01:32.052 --> 01:34.093
Could be good for you.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.015
I didn't even start high school.

01:36.016 --> 01:37.847
Dropouts have
a leg-up on me.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.850
Believe me, you're smarter than
plenty of these stooges around here.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.102
You should come to class,
see for yourself.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.725
I can't do that.

01:46.897 --> 01:48.228
Can I do that?

01:48.229 --> 01:51.532
You're Holden Matthews.
You can do whatever you want.

01:53.444 --> 01:55.156
Lately it's felt like
the exact opposite.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.077
See, you need a win.

01:58.078 --> 01:59.539
That's what you need
to get yourself going.

01:59.540 --> 02:00.870
What does that mean?

02:00.871 --> 02:03.583
Well, that's the beauty of it.
It's subjective.

02:03.584 --> 02:05.585
But you'll know
when you get your win.

02:05.586 --> 02:07.917
Okay, see this?
Finally.

02:07.918 --> 02:10.130
This right here, this is a win.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:26.977 --> 02:29.729
I... I fell off my bike.

02:29.730 --> 02:32.031
- Remember, I told you?
- Stain remover?

02:32.032 --> 02:33.694
Yeah.

02:52.092 --> 02:53.594
Here.

02:55.506 --> 02:58.929
Can't say I've had the pleasure
of cleaning blood before.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.851
Now puke?
That's a different story.

03:01.852 --> 03:06.146
You know, maybe coming to class
isn't such a bad idea.

03:08.399 --> 03:10.570
Okay. Cool.

03:10.571 --> 03:11.812
Cool.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.359
Are you allergic to money?

03:59.700 --> 04:01.030
I beg your pardon?

04:01.031 --> 04:02.412
Allergic.

04:02.413 --> 04:06.205
Like, if you come into contact with
too much, you'll break out in hives.

04:06.206 --> 04:07.707
Sorry, who are you?

04:07.708 --> 04:11.000
Someone who knows the dealer
is sitting pretty on 20.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.713
Miss, I need you to back up.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.176
Losing with 17 is like the
saddest thing I can imagine.

04:17.177 --> 04:19.379
And I can imagine you in
front of the mirror this morning

04:19.380 --> 04:22.222
thinking that's a spiffy ascot.

04:23.223 --> 04:25.765
There's 40 bloody grand
on this wager, love.

04:25.766 --> 04:29.769
Listen, I can lick this plate
clean if I want to.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.521
That's indisputable.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.313
But it's dull for me.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.815
I need a thrill.

04:36.106 --> 04:38.568
Can I convince you,
a perfect stranger,

04:38.569 --> 04:40.571
to trust me with
his precious money?

04:42.323 --> 04:43.324
Hmm.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.866
Sir?

04:52.122 --> 04:54.504
After all, it is
called gambling, isn't it?

04:54.505 --> 04:57.007
It's no gamble.
You've won.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.230
Let's just wait to see what the girl
says before we celebrate, yeah?

05:07.307 --> 05:08.559
Hit me.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.105
Twenty-one. Winner.

05:16.487 --> 05:19.359
A bottle of champagne
for my psychic friend!

05:19.360 --> 05:21.531
I'm not some
gypsy fortune teller.

05:21.532 --> 05:23.403
Then how else could you know
what was going to happen?

05:23.404 --> 05:25.034
Easy.

05:25.035 --> 05:26.577
I was in a four-year coma.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.171
Here, I'll swap out
his solution.

05:42.172 --> 05:43.172
That's all right.
I've got it.

05:43.173 --> 05:44.555
I'd like to do it.

05:45.926 --> 05:47.137
Sure.

05:48.809 --> 05:50.350
Usually start with his vitals.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.475
But I'm sure your way works too.

06:06.076 --> 06:08.489
This isn't quite the same
as Sahin's baklava, is it?

06:09.750 --> 06:11.832
With all that fresh
pistachio and honey.

06:17.337 --> 06:19.419
Remember, I used to say,

06:19.420 --> 06:22.001
"Grandpa, I don't want
to finish dinner.

06:22.002 --> 06:24.133
I only want baklava."

06:24.134 --> 06:25.465
And you'd say,

06:25.466 --> 06:27.808
"You're sweet enough already,
little bird."

06:30.601 --> 06:34.394
Wake up and we'll go eat
an entire box together.

06:38.068 --> 06:39.189
Willa?

06:49.029 --> 06:50.741
Arthur needs Holden.

06:51.992 --> 06:54.203
In all that time you two
are spending together,

06:54.204 --> 06:55.836
- he's still not remembering.
- He will.

06:57.297 --> 06:59.299
I have faith in him.

07:03.003 --> 07:07.046
Frost's man said he recognized
an anger in Holden.

07:07.047 --> 07:09.447
That it wouldn't be long before
he went off like a time bomb.

07:10.811 --> 07:12.432
He said it happened
to the others.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.266
I'm not sure I follow.

07:21.061 --> 07:22.982
I need to know.

07:22.983 --> 07:25.325
Is Arthur keeping
anything from me?

07:28.028 --> 07:30.700
I don't pretend to understand
half of Arthur's brilliance,

07:30.701 --> 07:33.784
but I have seen it enough times
to trust it.

07:34.915 --> 07:38.037
He's got such love
and respect for you.

07:38.038 --> 07:40.380
The granddaughter that
never once let him down.

07:44.585 --> 07:46.256
Don't start now.

08:00.310 --> 08:04.604
As Freud says, "We are what we are
because we have been what we have been."

08:04.605 --> 08:06.236
Now what does he mean?

08:07.568 --> 08:09.739
Our dreams represent
unfulfilled wishes.

08:09.740 --> 08:13.203
When repressed, these
deep desires can be masked.

08:14.204 --> 08:17.326
But if we analyze...
If we listen...

08:17.327 --> 08:20.621
They will reveal what it is our
unconscious mind truly wants.

08:23.173 --> 08:24.924
- Yes?
- What about nightmares?

08:24.925 --> 08:27.797
I mean, those aren't
wish fulfillment, right?

08:27.798 --> 08:31.591
I mean, if an ax murderer
is chasing me,

08:31.592 --> 08:34.804
is it my secret desire
to be chopped into tiny pieces?

08:36.015 --> 08:38.638
That's pretty vivid.

08:38.639 --> 08:42.140
And here's where the other pillar
of our field, Dr. Carl Jung,

08:42.142 --> 08:44.443
differed from his former mentor.

08:44.444 --> 08:48.527
It is Jung's contention that nightmares are
the unconscious mind's way of challenging us.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.990
Turning our fear into strength.

08:50.991 --> 08:53.413
Don't run from the man
wielding the ax.

08:54.414 --> 08:55.745
Because he's you.

08:55.746 --> 08:57.578
What does he want with me?

08:58.919 --> 09:00.620
To the benefit
of your future therapists,

09:00.621 --> 09:03.794
to be charged $200 an hour
to find out the answer.

09:06.086 --> 09:08.007
He's warning you're
doing something wrong.

09:08.008 --> 09:11.051
That course you're on...
needs correcting.

09:12.262 --> 09:15.554
Now, turning to the super ego...
Impulse control.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.437
Our mind's version of
security fraud protection.

09:18.438 --> 09:20.100
Teacher's pet.

09:30.951 --> 09:32.281
You still here?

09:32.282 --> 09:34.154
Yeah.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.157
I'm wiped.

09:38.158 --> 09:41.200
If I don't get a Chai Rooibos
tea, my head's gonna explode.

09:41.201 --> 09:43.203
Oh, would you please
just try an espresso?

09:50.050 --> 09:51.341
Well, he's still stable.

09:53.213 --> 09:55.886
Um... now all I can
think about is espresso.

09:57.427 --> 09:59.599
I'll brew us two cups,
and you can thank me later.

10:48.979 --> 10:50.980
- I don't know her.
- She won't leave me be!

10:50.981 --> 10:53.482
Um, no. I gave you one tip and
you hounded me for an hour.

10:53.483 --> 10:55.695
"Downton Abbey" over here
thought I'd put out.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.196
She's out of her sodding
mind, that one.

10:57.197 --> 10:59.078
What has she gotten me
mixed up in, eh?

10:59.079 --> 11:01.080
And I ask you, what sort
of person would do this?

11:01.081 --> 11:02.702
Charlene Singer!

11:02.703 --> 11:04.834
Oh, please.
Charlene is my father.

11:04.835 --> 11:06.085
Call me Charlie.

11:06.086 --> 11:09.839
Perhaps you thought you could
hide or mark cards here.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.290
You were wrong.

11:11.291 --> 11:13.052
My team is the finest
in the world.

11:13.053 --> 11:14.795
Yeah, they seem outstanding.

11:15.796 --> 11:17.216
What do you want with me?

11:17.217 --> 11:20.099
You cleared
1.7 million in winnings.

11:20.100 --> 11:23.473
You and your girlfriend cheated.

11:25.065 --> 11:28.567
- No, no, no, no!
- Girlfriend? Please!

11:28.568 --> 11:30.810
I've never saw this maniac
in my life!

11:30.811 --> 11:32.862
Okay, okay.
Alfred's telling the truth.

11:32.863 --> 11:34.775
I'm borderline unstable.

11:37.818 --> 11:41.030
I've never seen anyone
count cards so quickly.

11:41.031 --> 11:43.202
Counting cards
is a circus trick.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.914
I don't count cards.

11:44.915 --> 11:48.457
I see equations, broken down
to an infinitesimal level.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.289
Itty-bitty fractions
as algorithms.

11:50.290 --> 11:53.422
I take those probabilities and turn
them into virtual certainties.

11:53.423 --> 11:55.134
That's card counting.

11:55.135 --> 11:56.757
Yeah, that does sound
like card counting.

12:01.261 --> 12:03.843
Sparky's piece is empty.

12:03.844 --> 12:05.104
What?

12:05.105 --> 12:07.646
His wrist is angled too high.

12:07.647 --> 12:10.109
So that nine milli
weighs 33.6 ounces.

12:10.110 --> 12:13.853
He's 187 pounds.
Momentum is mass times velocity.

12:13.854 --> 12:17.616
Even one bullet,
124 grains of weight in there,

12:17.617 --> 12:20.069
would lower his wrist
just a tad.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.122
That thing's at full attention.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.534
At ease, soldier.

12:27.287 --> 12:29.669
Bet your life it's empty?

12:31.041 --> 12:33.583
All right, that's about as much
fun as I can have for one day.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.296
Aah!

12:39.509 --> 12:42.341
Wow, this...
This place is amazing.

12:42.342 --> 12:45.094
No one bothers you. No one tells
you where to be or what to do.

12:45.095 --> 12:48.057
And at 40 grand a semester,
they'll even hand you a diploma.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.478
You gotta be kidding me.

12:49.479 --> 12:50.981
Yeah, they probably
just e-mail it.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.193
Hi, Jamie.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.357
Wow. She hates me.

12:58.358 --> 12:59.819
Well, you stood her up.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.991
But that wasn't hate.
That was more like, um...

13:01.992 --> 13:03.203
aggressive indifference.

13:05.615 --> 13:08.327
No, this... this is a sign.

13:08.328 --> 13:10.619
What are the odds she'd be here
right at this moment?

13:10.620 --> 13:12.751
Pretty good.
It's not a huge school.

13:12.752 --> 13:15.835
It's like the professor said...
Turn your fears into strengths.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.796
Course correct.
I'm gonna ask her out.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.219
Are you seriously quoting
Professor Blackbeard right now?

13:20.220 --> 13:22.011
I'm gonna get my win.

13:22.012 --> 13:24.975
Just because you're saying my thing
doesn't make it a good idea!

13:26.186 --> 13:27.517
What's up?

13:28.929 --> 13:30.100
Jamie, stop, come on!

13:31.141 --> 13:33.022
- Please!
- Holden, look,

13:33.023 --> 13:35.064
you really don't need
to come up with an excuse.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.106
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.858
I'm sorry!

13:38.859 --> 13:41.991
I was the luckiest guy on Earth
when you said yes

13:41.992 --> 13:43.402
and I blew it.

13:43.403 --> 13:44.904
Agreed.

13:44.905 --> 13:46.035
No, it's just...

13:46.036 --> 13:48.407
Look, my coma flared up.

13:48.408 --> 13:51.250
When that happens, it makes
me act like a real doofus.

13:51.251 --> 13:53.503
Like becoming the Hulk,
only a bigger jerk.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.415
Well, in that case,
you were Ultra Hulk.

13:56.416 --> 13:58.627
You know about...
Never mind.

13:58.628 --> 14:00.299
The good news is,
that jerk who stood you up?

14:00.300 --> 14:02.052
He's gone.
I've exorcised the demon.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.553
Jamie, please.

14:04.554 --> 14:07.596
You deserve to be treated
so much better than that.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.849
Please, can I make it up to you?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.142
Look, Holden, I really
need to get to class.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.184
Jamie.

14:18.438 --> 14:20.150
Do you believe in fate?

14:21.571 --> 14:24.905
- What?
- Do you believe in fate?

14:25.946 --> 14:27.156
Not really.

14:27.157 --> 14:31.160
Gimme one shot
to change your mind.

14:31.161 --> 14:34.493
If you don't have
the best time ever,

14:34.494 --> 14:36.957
you never have to see me again.

14:46.006 --> 14:49.719
You just make sure the right Holden
Matthews shows up this time.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.171
Charlene.

15:23.713 --> 15:25.095
I'd love a word.

15:49.029 --> 15:52.282
Heh. Take a breath.
She's coming.

15:55.035 --> 15:59.248
Hey, you're, uh,
not giving her this flower?

15:59.249 --> 16:00.499
It's weird.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.212
What, isn't it romantic or...

16:03.213 --> 16:04.843
You look like a cartoon.

16:04.844 --> 16:06.925
Where'd you even get it?

16:06.926 --> 16:10.050
- The bar.
- Yeah. Okay, come on.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.593
She'll be here any minute.

16:16.146 --> 16:18.438
Hey, see?
Speak of the devil.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.523
- Hi!
- Hi.

16:24.524 --> 16:26.235
How are you?

16:26.236 --> 16:28.107
Oh man, I'm so sorry I'm late.

16:28.108 --> 16:29.908
The rain is just a nightmare.

16:29.909 --> 16:32.161
It's fine. It's, um...

16:32.162 --> 16:33.823
- Hi. Hey, uh...
- Hi!

16:35.035 --> 16:36.745
- Hi.
- How are you?

16:36.746 --> 16:37.956
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

16:37.957 --> 16:39.209
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.216
Thank you.

16:47.627 --> 16:49.128
Do you have your license?

16:49.129 --> 16:50.299
I don't have a Blockbuster card.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.800
Yeah, neither does anyone else.

16:51.801 --> 16:53.092
What happened to Blockbuster?

16:53.093 --> 16:55.135
Um, it's in a better place.

16:58.688 --> 17:01.600
Actually, I'm what's
called exploratory.

17:01.601 --> 17:03.021
Like Magellan?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.194
Like that, yeah!

17:05.194 --> 17:06.945
Yeah, totally like that.

17:13.242 --> 17:14.782
The world is such a big place,

17:14.784 --> 17:17.326
and I'd really hate to get in the
way of way of what it has to offer.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.958
Sounds like you
believe in fate after all.

17:19.959 --> 17:22.080
Maybe I'm starting to.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.083
Look at that!

17:24.214 --> 17:26.255
Hard copy of "City
Slickers 2" I guess.

17:26.256 --> 17:28.877
Sorry, do I have
a booger on my face?

17:28.878 --> 17:30.840
I like you.

17:33.093 --> 17:36.226
Well, I... I like
that you like me.

17:57.497 --> 17:59.199
What have you been hiding?

18:03.042 --> 18:05.083
Using a combination
of light and sound,

18:05.084 --> 18:08.967
we were able to replicate
the comatose mind.

18:08.968 --> 18:13.672
This machine disconnects the mind
from its bodily constraints.

18:13.673 --> 18:17.216
And it is the destination
of that journey

18:17.217 --> 18:20.269
where we have made
exhilarating leaps and bounds

18:20.270 --> 18:22.182
in the study of the unconscious.

18:23.183 --> 18:27.316
I was comforted.
And felt alone.

18:27.317 --> 18:29.569
- But...
- Safe.

18:31.821 --> 18:34.072
There was woods.
There was thick...

18:34.073 --> 18:36.195
It was gorgeous.

18:36.196 --> 18:37.827
I needed to leave.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.079
I... I was terrified.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.452
And it was blinding.

18:43.453 --> 18:45.335
I was so alone.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.007
It is our belief that
the comatose mind

18:49.008 --> 18:50.008
is sent off.

18:50.009 --> 18:53.173
It travels to another
realm of existence.

18:56.216 --> 18:58.427
Our subjects each describe,

18:58.428 --> 19:01.850
in remarkably similar terms,
this place.

19:01.851 --> 19:04.023
They draw this.

19:05.265 --> 19:07.477
Concentric circles.

19:10.069 --> 19:13.192
Scientists and theologians
have wrestled for ages

19:13.193 --> 19:17.277
about the brain and what happens to it
when it fails to function as expected.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.869
Does it cease to exist?

19:20.870 --> 19:22.741
Is it vegetative?

19:22.742 --> 19:25.914
Hardly.
We are on the verge

19:25.915 --> 19:28.208
- of pinpointing
that very discovery.

19:30.340 --> 19:33.052
The patient is going into
cardiac arrest!

19:43.683 --> 19:46.105
We will need to recalibrate
our approach, Dr. Frost.

19:50.019 --> 19:51.401
Dr. Frost.

19:53.773 --> 19:56.195
Frost was...
Arthur's partner?

20:11.251 --> 20:13.712
All yours.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.885
Hey. You're on deck, big guy.
Come on. Pick a song.

20:16.886 --> 20:19.338
- Look, can I just work up to it?
- Okay, look.

20:19.339 --> 20:21.300
I didn't wanna have
to resort to this,

20:21.301 --> 20:23.302
but you stood me up.

20:23.303 --> 20:25.805
- Yeah, man, she's got a point.
- Mm-hmm.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.848
Okay. Are you a betting man?

20:29.849 --> 20:31.400
I'm listening.

20:31.401 --> 20:33.522
I will randomly pick a song

20:33.523 --> 20:35.485
with my eyes closed.
No cheating.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.738
If you know the song,
then we sing.

20:40.159 --> 20:42.201
- Hmm.
- We'll let fate decide.

20:43.202 --> 20:44.744
You're on.

20:52.422 --> 20:55.374
"Call Me Maybe."

20:55.375 --> 20:59.177
Oh gosh. We sang that like a million
times freshman year, right?

20:59.178 --> 21:01.089
Yeah.

21:01.090 --> 21:02.681
Well, um...

21:02.682 --> 21:05.515
I think, you, uh...

21:06.936 --> 21:09.098
meant to stop there.

21:13.983 --> 21:15.605
Hmm?

21:31.411 --> 21:32.752
Oh.

21:51.020 --> 21:54.774
Woo-hoo!-

22:20.920 --> 22:23.132
Hey. Are you okay?

22:25.224 --> 22:26.886
Holden?

22:28.097 --> 22:29.138
I gotta go.

22:31.471 --> 22:32.642
Holden!

22:37.316 --> 22:40.149
Hey! Slow down!

22:41.981 --> 22:43.402
I'm sorry, I just...

22:43.403 --> 22:45.404
I had to get out
of there, and I...

22:45.405 --> 22:47.986
Okay, okay, that's okay.
We can...

22:47.987 --> 22:49.578
We can stay out here
as long as you need.

22:49.579 --> 22:51.249
No, look, tonight
had to be perfect.

22:51.250 --> 22:54.122
That's what I promised you
and I... oh!

22:54.123 --> 22:57.456
No, you promised me
a great time, and you delivered.

22:57.457 --> 23:00.048
I shouldn't have pushed you.

23:00.049 --> 23:03.001
No, that other Holden,
the one I thought was long gone?

23:03.002 --> 23:05.635
It turns out he's more
persistent than I thought.

23:08.097 --> 23:10.599
Okay, um...
it's okay.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.061
Just...

23:14.434 --> 23:15.685
talk to me.

23:18.357 --> 23:20.109
Look, I can't. I...

23:21.190 --> 23:25.654
No, I want to, it's just, I...
I think I need a minute alone.

23:25.655 --> 23:26.946
All right?

23:28.698 --> 23:30.289
I think you need
more than a minute.

23:31.451 --> 23:35.033
No, I... I...
What are the odds

23:35.034 --> 23:37.166
of a second second chance
to make this work?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.542
That bad, huh?

23:45.595 --> 23:48.047
You shouldn't have
to make this work, Holden.

23:50.219 --> 23:51.511
You can't force fate.

24:01.150 --> 24:02.822
Take care of yourself.

24:32.051 --> 24:34.052
Kid, are you okay?

24:34.053 --> 24:36.095
Hey, kid?
You all right?

24:54.994 --> 24:55.995
Get up!

24:59.118 --> 25:00.118
Get to the temple.

25:00.119 --> 25:02.081
They can't follow us.
We'll be safe in there.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.363
That's how we met.

25:35.364 --> 25:37.916
How we met?
I could've killed you!

25:37.917 --> 25:39.117
You need help.

25:39.118 --> 25:40.329
I need Willa.

25:42.001 --> 25:43.623
Ow, ooh! Oh.

25:44.714 --> 25:46.755
Damn crazy kid.
That was your fault!

25:46.756 --> 25:48.588
You gotta learn
to be more careful.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.761
Holden!

25:52.762 --> 25:54.012
Hey, are you okay?

25:54.013 --> 25:56.014
Did you just get hit
by that car?

25:56.015 --> 25:58.016
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

25:58.017 --> 25:59.938
I gotta see about a girl.

25:59.939 --> 26:01.810
It's too late, man.
Jamie's gone.

26:01.811 --> 26:04.102
No, I know.
Not her. It's...

26:04.103 --> 26:06.105
It's not too late for this one.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.188
What, there's another one?

26:10.900 --> 26:12.031
Where are you going?

26:34.213 --> 26:36.054
Ten grand on homie in red.

26:36.055 --> 26:38.056
Your friend want a taste too?

26:38.057 --> 26:39.517
She's Mormon.

26:39.518 --> 26:42.221
15 grand.
On white.

26:43.723 --> 26:47.105
Watching two men pummel each other to
death just screams your wheelhouse.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.608
Hollow Sky has been alerted to a
young man with special abilities.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.281
A compatriot.
Fellow Realm freak.

26:53.282 --> 26:56.404
I hope not quite like you.
Word is, he's powerful.

26:56.405 --> 26:59.037
Turned an MRI machine
into the Fourth of July.

26:59.038 --> 27:02.791
Dr. Frost believes he's powerful
enough to cross the Bridge.

27:02.792 --> 27:06.005
The Bridge is a myth you all
push to keep the bills paid.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.957
Be that as it may, Frost insists

27:08.958 --> 27:10.628
on having an audience
with this young man.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.091
Frost believes he will
help bring Hollow Sky

27:13.092 --> 27:14.462
into a new stratosphere.

27:14.463 --> 27:16.675
Your services are required.

27:16.676 --> 27:19.467
This young man can trust you.
He can relate to you.

27:19.468 --> 27:21.349
I don't relate to me.

27:21.350 --> 27:24.432
Is this really the best use
of your prodigious talents?

27:24.433 --> 27:27.435
Yeah, actually, and how
many times can I tell you

27:27.436 --> 27:30.478
and your pie-in-the-sky
organization to get bent?

27:30.479 --> 27:32.111
I've lost count.

27:47.997 --> 27:50.168
You're gonna wanna pay up
that 15 grand now.

27:50.169 --> 27:54.003
Maurice gets a little bit stabby
when you hold out on him.

27:55.965 --> 27:59.297
Look, you want him so bad?
Go scoop him up yourself.

27:59.298 --> 28:01.219
Lord knows you've got
resources out the wazoo.

28:01.220 --> 28:03.391
This case is more delicate.

28:03.392 --> 28:06.185
- Why is that?
- Because Arthur got to him first.

28:13.152 --> 28:14.403
Arthur?

28:17.116 --> 28:20.079
Perhaps you'd be interested
in making a trade?

28:26.535 --> 28:28.087
What's Boy Wonder's name?

28:59.028 --> 29:00.569
What is this place?

29:01.911 --> 29:02.992
It's a safe haven.

29:07.286 --> 29:11.420
No, I mean where...
Where are we?

29:15.424 --> 29:16.836
Am I dead?

29:17.877 --> 29:19.427
You're far from it.

29:19.428 --> 29:22.550
You're alive in a way few
people ever get to experience.

29:22.551 --> 29:24.013
Ow! Mmm!

29:26.555 --> 29:28.516
This isn't a dream either,
is it?

29:28.517 --> 29:31.100
- No.
- Figured.

29:32.191 --> 29:35.063
Traditionally dream injuries
don't hurt like... ow!

29:35.064 --> 29:36.354
Careful.

29:36.355 --> 29:38.107
Sorry about that.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.662
That thing I did outside,

29:44.663 --> 29:47.035
with the wolf and the...

29:47.036 --> 29:49.617
And the...
If this isn't a dream,

29:49.618 --> 29:51.290
how was that even possible?

29:53.002 --> 29:54.802
The reason you were able
to do what you did...

29:55.965 --> 29:57.296
it's because of this place.

29:59.628 --> 30:01.010
I think it agrees with you.

30:25.494 --> 30:29.078
There. You're good as new.

30:32.081 --> 30:33.332
Better than new.

30:41.460 --> 30:43.052
What is it?

30:44.223 --> 30:45.554
Nothing.

30:46.675 --> 30:48.267
I just, um...

30:50.349 --> 30:52.181
I thought I was alone in here.

30:53.102 --> 30:55.183
You're not alone.

30:55.184 --> 30:56.854
Not anymore.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.187
I'm Willa.

31:00.189 --> 31:01.901
Holden.

31:03.242 --> 31:05.194
I'm really glad
I found you, Holden.

31:06.615 --> 31:07.947
Me too.

31:13.082 --> 31:15.834
- pinpointing
that very discov...

31:24.003 --> 31:26.215
- Holden,
I didn't know you were...

31:27.056 --> 31:28.057
What is it?

31:30.599 --> 31:31.640
What's wrong?

31:46.155 --> 31:47.736
I'm really glad you found me.

31:49.158 --> 31:50.329
You remembered.

32:03.002 --> 32:05.803
The frozen mountain when the
ravens attacked, do you remember?

32:05.804 --> 32:07.006
No, not exactly.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.509
What about...
What about the sinkhole,

32:11.510 --> 32:13.012
- when we fell in?
- Vaguely.

32:15.644 --> 32:17.895
- What about the time...
- Willa! It's you.

32:17.896 --> 32:21.019
Okay? That's what I remember. No,
I don't totally understand it,

32:21.020 --> 32:23.321
but, look, I know
that we had something.

32:23.322 --> 32:25.064
That's what matters.

32:29.158 --> 32:31.199
Ow! Oh!

32:31.200 --> 32:33.992
- What happened to you?
- I... I got hit by a car.

32:33.993 --> 32:36.704
It's fine. It... helped
me remember you.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.877
Oh. Why didn't
I think of that?

32:44.633 --> 32:45.714
Willa, I...

32:47.136 --> 32:48.297
I know him.

32:49.548 --> 32:52.430
Oh. That's Arthur.

32:52.431 --> 32:55.184
I've been seeing him
everywhere since I woke up.

32:57.096 --> 32:58.687
That's because...

32:59.978 --> 33:03.102
That's because he trained you
and now he needs your help.

33:07.106 --> 33:09.818
Wait, wait. Well, can
you take me to see him?

33:10.909 --> 33:12.321
Can we...
Can we see him?

33:13.782 --> 33:14.783
Right now?

33:16.115 --> 33:19.328
Um, yeah.
Yeah, of course.

33:32.591 --> 33:34.433
Hello? Still me.

33:38.307 --> 33:40.098
Why are you so quiet?

33:40.099 --> 33:41.900
Am I being quiet?

33:45.104 --> 33:46.604
Holden will be fine.

33:46.605 --> 33:49.648
You don't think it's strange
he just up and left tonight?

33:51.070 --> 33:53.911
Lots of things about your
brother are strange.

33:53.912 --> 33:55.244
Do you need to say that?

33:56.575 --> 33:59.658
- He's trying.
- Yeah, I heard the song.

34:03.372 --> 34:04.463
It's just...

34:05.794 --> 34:08.667
hey, the blood on his jacket...

34:09.797 --> 34:12.049
and the running
off-stage?

34:12.050 --> 34:15.514
He gets hit by a car and immediately
goes off to see some other girl?

34:16.514 --> 34:18.355
I mean, stop me when any
of this sounds normal.

34:20.179 --> 34:21.179
No.

34:22.811 --> 34:23.851
What are you saying?

34:31.190 --> 34:34.112
That I... I don't think he's ready
to live back in the real world.

34:41.870 --> 34:44.252
If there's a family
of cannibals in that room,

34:44.253 --> 34:46.335
I'm taking back all the nice
things I said about you.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.297
Look...

34:51.049 --> 34:53.261
Arthur invested
everything into this.

34:53.262 --> 34:54.473
We all have.

34:56.215 --> 34:58.976
And I was getting worried you wouldn't
remember what you'd have to do.

35:24.082 --> 35:26.665
He can't be here.
Get away from him!

35:29.168 --> 35:30.379
It's you.

35:32.171 --> 35:34.592
Daniel, this is Holden.

35:34.593 --> 35:35.924
He's here to help.

35:37.386 --> 35:40.097
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:40.098 --> 35:42.641
What is it, specifically, you
need me to do to help him?

35:44.813 --> 35:47.226
- He doesn't remember.
- He does.

35:48.187 --> 35:50.189
We're just figuring out
the best recourse...

35:51.440 --> 35:53.111
and that means going back in.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.484
In? As in...

35:58.237 --> 35:59.987
Are you gonna put me in a coma?

35:59.988 --> 36:02.581
No, no. No coma.

36:03.702 --> 36:04.913
There's another way.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.672
What happened to him, anyway?

36:15.053 --> 36:17.216
Arthur spent years
traveling back and forth.

36:20.008 --> 36:21.178
That's when he was with you,

36:21.179 --> 36:22.471
teaching you.

36:23.852 --> 36:25.223
But he got stuck

36:25.224 --> 36:27.606
and soon after,
he became unresponsive.

36:28.607 --> 36:29.938
Soon after what?

36:36.024 --> 36:37.025
After you woke up.

37:00.048 --> 37:03.100
For 12 years, Holden Matthews
has laid at County Hospital

37:03.101 --> 37:06.143
in one of the longest-recorded
comas in history.

37:06.144 --> 37:07.765
And today, that streak
has finally come...

37:07.766 --> 37:10.899
Four thousand, three hundred
some odd days in a coma?

37:14.062 --> 37:15.483
Holden Matthews,

37:15.484 --> 37:17.446
maybe you are something special.

39:32.661 --> 39:35.292
It's powering itself up.

39:35.293 --> 39:37.546
I've never seen it
do that before.

39:39.548 --> 39:41.709
You're connected
to this machine.

39:41.710 --> 39:43.632
Just like you are to the Realm.

39:45.003 --> 39:46.134
I can feel it.

39:47.556 --> 39:50.137
So, you...
think I'm the only one

39:50.138 --> 39:52.009
who can get this thing to work?

39:52.010 --> 39:54.222
I've exhausted it myself.

39:55.934 --> 39:57.145
I'm missing something.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.160
Holden!

40:13.331 --> 40:15.083
- Oh! Oh!
- No!

40:16.244 --> 40:17.626
Oh my god!

40:18.917 --> 40:19.918
Hey.

40:22.090 --> 40:23.501
Don't worry.
I've got you.

40:23.502 --> 40:25.713
Ah! Don't let go!
Don't let go!

40:25.714 --> 40:28.596
Hey.

40:28.597 --> 40:30.549
No!

40:49.367 --> 40:50.619
You should stand back.

40:54.743 --> 40:57.705
Holden, stop!

40:57.706 --> 41:01.128
Oh! Holden, please stop!
What are you doing?

41:01.129 --> 41:02.130
No!

41:04.132 --> 41:07.045
Stop! Please!

41:09.007 --> 41:10.638
What did you do?

41:10.639 --> 41:12.299
That machine was
our only way back!

41:12.300 --> 41:14.802
Exactly.
We're never going back.

41:14.803 --> 41:19.687
- What? No, Holden, you don't understand!
- No, I understand perfectly!

41:19.688 --> 41:22.730
I had you,
and then you were gone.

41:22.731 --> 41:25.604
I won't risk that ever again.
