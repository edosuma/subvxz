01:59.300 --> 02:01.300
Fuck this! I'm calling Carlo.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.050
Yeah, they didn't show.

02:11.085 --> 02:13.200
The Vespa scooters.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.200
We gotta wait.

02:18.200 --> 02:22.000
Carlo was furious. His guys waited by
the Hackensack River all night.

02:22.700 --> 02:25.000
fuckin' Vespas never got in my hands.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.100
This is Port Newark.
Where were your longshoremen?

02:29.135 --> 02:31.500
Heightened security at ports, al-Quaeda.

02:31.535 --> 02:34.800
- Done, Johnny.
- I gotta go.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.300
Nice job, Billy boy.

02:45.300 --> 02:48.700
Carlo was told it was a go. If it didn't
happen, why did nobody call?

02:48.735 --> 02:51.500
A lotta things didn't happen
that seem like they happen...

02:51.600 --> 02:55.200
Your cousin didn't whack Joey,
the Vespas never got into my hands.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.265
Come on, go, Soph!

03:03.300 --> 03:06.500
- Hey, Soph is open! Come on!
- Over here!

03:06.600 --> 03:08.700
She's gotta be at least 11.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.565
Don't put up with that, Lissie!

03:11.600 --> 03:14.100
Careful with those elbows, number seven!

03:14.200 --> 03:16.500
Hey, out of bounds! Out of bounds!

03:16.535 --> 03:18.865
Oh, Lissie, go!

03:18.900 --> 03:21.365
They're just a bunch of losers!

03:21.400 --> 03:24.800
- No negatives, you!
- Come on, putz, charge the ball!

03:24.835 --> 03:26.300
Charge it!

03:27.900 --> 03:30.600
Foul! That kid tripped my kid!

03:30.700 --> 03:32.600
Legal, she was going for the ball.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.300
- She was not.
- Score!

03:34.400 --> 03:37.500
- Score, come on!
- Your kid is outta control.

03:37.535 --> 03:39.565
She's been tripping all summer.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.400
- Shut up and get outta here.
- Don't tell me to shut up!

03:46.800 --> 03:48.700
What, are you crazy?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.300
Please. Come on! Somebody!

03:55.400 --> 03:57.500
How do you like it now, bitch?

03:59.300 --> 04:01.500
Her kid kicked my kid. Get off!

04:03.100 --> 04:05.300
- Cost ya 100.
- Call.

04:06.300 --> 04:07.900
Sit down. Sit, sit.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.300
I talked to John.

04:14.400 --> 04:18.399
The Vespa scooters came in, but there was
no opportunity to grab them

04:18.500 --> 04:20.964
because of increased security at the ports.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.700
Jesus Christ! The young crowd is crazy
for these scooters.

04:24.735 --> 04:27.465
- He owes me half that load.
- You're not buying it?

04:27.500 --> 04:31.250
I don't know what to think.
He's getting cute with his remarks.

04:31.285 --> 04:35.000
All I know is his behaviour
at that kid's funeral was a disgrace.

04:35.035 --> 04:37.365
It's a big part of my livelihood, that port.

04:37.400 --> 04:42.400
I will say, very interesting timing, T.
You and John had that chat at the funeral...

04:42.435 --> 04:44.317
whatever that was...

04:44.352 --> 04:46.200
suddenly, no Vespas.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.400
All right, I gotta take this.

04:54.700 --> 04:58.000
Take one of Carlo's guys,
start hanging around Port Newark.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.400
Find out what the fuck is going on.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.400
- The property taxes, I know.
- Hello to you too.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.165
Your sister Janice got arrested.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.850
- What?
- In Essex County this afternoon,

05:10.885 --> 05:13.465
an incident of sports rage
among soccer moms

05:13.500 --> 05:17.100
led to the arrest of a Verona woman
with ties to the Mafia.

05:17.135 --> 05:19.300
Our Gillian Glessner was on the scene.

05:19.400 --> 05:23.600
Think that other mother better go
into the soccer-mom protection programme?

05:23.635 --> 05:26.900
Maybe she should, Carl.
It started here at Summit Avenue Park

05:26.935 --> 05:29.600
during a nine-and ten-year-olds'
soccer match.

05:29.700 --> 05:34.600
An altercation between soccer moms sent
one mother to the hospital and one to jail.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.500
Denise McCarthy, a parent,
witnessed the violence.

05:37.535 --> 05:39.065
I just feel so bad for the kids.

05:39.100 --> 05:42.500
Parents taping the match
captured the mêlée.

05:42.535 --> 05:44.665
Somebodyl

05:44.700 --> 05:46.600
How do you like it now, bitch?

05:48.300 --> 05:50.000
Her kid kicked my kidl

05:50.100 --> 05:52.600
Charges are pending, but we know...

05:52.700 --> 05:56.500
that the woman shown here being taken
into custody is Janice Baccalieri,

05:56.600 --> 06:00.000
sister of reputed New Jersey mob boss
Anthony Soprano.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.700
Guess you could call it a Mafia-related hit.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.600
We spoke with psychologist Bela Kakuk.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.965
It's a growing problem in our society.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Psychologists are finding
that certain individuals

06:11.035 --> 06:13.765
are particularly prone to rage.

06:13.800 --> 06:17.565
Almost any frustration, inconvenience

06:17.600 --> 06:20.900
or perceived inconsideration
will set them off.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.300
Motherfucker!

06:27.800 --> 06:30.200
Janice, open the door!

06:31.500 --> 06:33.300
- Where is she?
- It wasn't my fault!

06:33.400 --> 06:36.900
My name was all over the fuckin' TV
because of your bullshit!

06:37.000 --> 06:40.400
It's not that simple.
The woman's kid was picking on Sophia.

06:40.435 --> 06:44.067
- Why didn't they collar her?
- I am suing the township

06:44.102 --> 06:47.665
- for wrongful arrest and the YSO.
- No. No, you're not!

06:47.700 --> 06:51.300
What you're gonna do is call Neil Mink,
play it down, pay the fine

06:51.400 --> 06:54.000
and not turn this into
one of your causes célèbres.

06:54.100 --> 06:58.900
Anybody's side but mine.
That bitch is lucky I didn't kill her.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.100
- Well, we know that.
- What?

07:03.500 --> 07:06.300
- You and your fuckin' temper.
- Get out!

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
This is the end of it.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.900
Get out!

07:25.300 --> 07:27.500
I know this looks bad.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.500
On the other hand,
she called Sophia her daughter.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.900
I don't give a fuck.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.165
All right, I do give a fuck.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.700
But how many times I gotta tell you?
Get control of your wife!

07:57.100 --> 07:58.765
I'm so embarrassed.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.000
I don't wanna see any of my friends again.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.500
Well, when you're a parent, you'll see.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.500
You'll defend your children
like a lion with her cubs.

08:06.535 --> 08:09.400
- You're not my parent.
- What did you say?

08:11.600 --> 08:13.365
I'm here...

08:13.400 --> 08:16.400
and I try to care very much.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.700
- Now get to sleep.
- You gonna punch me?

08:21.100 --> 08:23.900
Jan, can I talk to you?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.200
Go to sleep.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.200
We'll talk tomorrow. I'm exhausted.

08:41.299 --> 08:43.799
No. Now.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.800
What, I don't have a say in things?

08:45.900 --> 08:49.065
Janice, I think you need professional help.

08:49.100 --> 08:52.600
I'll be having an extra session
with Sandy, believe me.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.700
What does she do? Tells you
you were picked on by your father

08:55.800 --> 08:57.850
and asks you to read her screenplays.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.900
I think there's anger specialists.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.300
You should see a weight-loss specialist.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.465
You don't see it in yourself.
I heard you with Sophia.

09:06.500 --> 09:11.800
You were getting along so much better,
she says one little thing and you get nasty.

09:11.835 --> 09:15.400
- I'm so sore.
- This is not an isolated incident.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.350
They won't let you shop
up at the corner anymore.

09:18.385 --> 09:21.200
Those coffee beans were burnt.
You tasted them.

09:21.235 --> 09:23.465
Janice, I like a spitfire type,

09:23.500 --> 09:27.500
I told you,
but we can't live like this, me and the kids.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.865
Like what?

09:29.900 --> 09:32.400
This was a nice house.

09:32.500 --> 09:36.300
Peaceful... I don't know.
There wasn't all this yelling and tension.

09:36.335 --> 09:38.400
How could you understand?

09:38.500 --> 09:40.450
Your dad was a sweetheart,

09:40.485 --> 09:43.292
even when he had emphysema.

09:43.327 --> 09:46.100
My house... it was dog eat dog.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.300
Well, be that as it may, the past and all,

09:48.400 --> 09:51.900
if you don't go to these anger classes
they have or whatever,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.400
this with us ain't gonna work out.

10:05.900 --> 10:08.600
Gentlemen, it's rollin'. It's nine. Place nine.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.200
What do you think he clears here?

10:18.500 --> 10:20.800
Two craps tables, blackjack, roulette.

10:20.900 --> 10:23.700
You gotta figure he's
grabbing anywhere from 2,500

10:23.800 --> 10:26.400
to five Gs a night for himself.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.700
It used to be you, didn't it?

10:30.800 --> 10:32.500
Teacher's pet?

10:32.600 --> 10:35.300
- Stop making meatballs, Paulie.
- I'm just saying.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.700
Now you know what I went through.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.600
It's the same Gina had at her wedding.

10:45.635 --> 10:47.800
We should see how it looks on your face.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.000
What the fuck?

11:07.700 --> 11:09.665
- What's up?
- Hey there, cuz.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.100
- Guess who called me.
- How'd you find me?

11:12.135 --> 11:14.365
- You're not gonna guess?
- OK, who?

11:14.400 --> 11:17.900
- Our friend with the orchard.
- No shit. He OK?

11:17.935 --> 11:20.467
Yeah, sold the place, moving to Florida.

11:20.502 --> 11:23.000
He should, he's getting on in years.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.365
Oh, shit.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.500
You still got your canned peaches there.

11:28.900 --> 11:32.300
I just had the car serviced.
Watch what ya say.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.500
I gotta move that shit? Again?

11:34.600 --> 11:36.300
That developer's going up there.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.100
Obviously, it wouldn't be good
for you or our friend

11:39.200 --> 11:42.000
if somebody opened the canned fruit.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.650
So you and your cousin here
will take care of it.

11:44.685 --> 11:47.165
- I'll do it.
- I'm worried about the old guy.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.900
- I told ya, I'll do it.
- My old man's got a few jars up there also.

11:50.935 --> 11:53.700
Could make problems for my uncle.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.600
It's gonna be a lotta work,

11:56.700 --> 12:00.000
which with Louise around
can only be done at night.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.900
- That's true.
- Thing's gotta be done in two weeks.

12:02.935 --> 12:04.700
Bulldozers are coming.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.565
- Are you picking out wedding cakes?
- Yeah.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.465
- Hope you have better luck than I did.
- You didn't like your cake?

12:12.500 --> 12:17.000
I think your luck's been fuckin' great,
and listen to you cursing it out.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.200
What, you got something you wanna say?

12:20.200 --> 12:22.100
- All right.
- So call me.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.400
Who is this Uncle Pat anyway?

12:36.200 --> 12:38.865
He was a knock-around guy like Tony's dad,

12:38.900 --> 12:42.200
but they let him retire to this farm
upstate New York.

12:44.100 --> 12:47.500
It sounds funny, but it wasn't.
He had the hiccups for like a year.

12:47.535 --> 12:49.200
Jeez.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.100
Great guy. He had a daughter,
but she lived with her mom.

12:52.200 --> 12:57.300
Us boys each got sent up there summers
when we hit up 12 or 13.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.265
He'd school us.

13:00.300 --> 13:04.200
- Did he have the hiccups?
- I told ya that went away.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.965
You think it's fuckin' funny?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.300
He almost committed suicide because of it.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.165
How would you like it?

13:10.200 --> 13:13.300
Where's my Barney's underpants
with ventilated cotton?

13:13.400 --> 13:15.700
Still in the dryer.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.965
Tell ya one thing,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.900
I need fuckin' Tony B
up there like I need a third nut.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.700
All this resentment.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.465
- He is your cousin.
- Yeah?

13:28.500 --> 13:31.800
Should've seen him when I was little...
him and Tony both.

13:31.835 --> 13:36.200
How they broke my balls, teased me.

13:37.100 --> 13:40.700
One time, I was spending the summer
up at Uncle Pat's farm

13:40.735 --> 13:42.965
just like they used to - I was 11.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.200
They came up -
they were like 19- to shoot guns.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.300
They didn't take me with 'em,
and when I found 'em,

13:49.335 --> 13:52.265
they said I had to be initiated
into a special club

13:52.300 --> 13:55.400
by being tied to a tree
alone in the orchard for an hour.

13:57.700 --> 14:00.800
I was on that tree
till three in the fuckin' morning.

14:02.700 --> 14:06.300
I worshipped these two guys...
Tony Soprano especially.

14:06.335 --> 14:08.065
When he was by himself,

14:08.100 --> 14:09.900
he used to push me on my Big Wheels,

14:09.935 --> 14:11.867
he'd teach me curse words.

14:11.902 --> 14:13.800
When he was by himself.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.200
Where's the Tinactin?

14:20.700 --> 14:22.600
Right on the night table.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.300
And here we are again. Tony B goes wrong,

14:26.400 --> 14:29.400
and Tony lays a 200K-a-year
cash cow on him.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.200
Christopher, don't get mad, OK?

14:39.900 --> 14:42.500
I know we kinda touched on it
a couple times,

14:42.600 --> 14:45.250
but you're so unhappy.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.865
What if we left here,

14:47.900 --> 14:51.900
went far away,
and you went into something else?

14:51.935 --> 14:54.800
- Like what?
- I don't know, like...

14:54.900 --> 14:56.800
Pick up your writing maybe?

14:57.800 --> 14:59.500
Male modelling...

15:00.900 --> 15:03.250
I'll get back to the writing some day,

15:03.285 --> 15:05.600
but from a position of great wealth.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.000
As far as male modelling,
I'd probably be a success,

15:10.100 --> 15:12.500
but I wouldn't want to be
around those people.

15:14.800 --> 15:19.300
I'm a soldier, Adriana.
When are you gonna understand that?

15:30.300 --> 15:32.200
What the fuck?

15:32.300 --> 15:34.465
- Carmela.
- What?

15:34.500 --> 15:37.200
There's no water in the pool.

15:37.235 --> 15:39.400
Yeah, I had it drained.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.900
The electricity costs a fortune.

15:41.935 --> 15:44.300
You're the only one who uses it.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.600
We were getting along better.

15:52.700 --> 15:57.700
So, you polluted all the decent lawyers in
New Jersey so they can't represent me?

15:57.800 --> 16:00.465
- You couldn't play fair.
- I didn't want it!

16:00.500 --> 16:03.600
Let's just pretend that
you weren't begging for it

16:03.700 --> 16:05.600
in a million different ways, OK,

16:05.700 --> 16:08.100
because I am worn out here.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.400
He's a nice kid, Finn, right?

16:46.600 --> 16:48.600
Right.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.700
We gonna throw 'em
an engagement party or what?

16:56.735 --> 16:58.800
If we can be civil.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.300
She's so young.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.900
Same age we were.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.800
It wasn't all bad.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.300
Last time, I asked you to jot down
one or two situations

17:22.400 --> 17:24.400
or people that trigger your anger,

17:24.435 --> 17:26.200
so when you think about it,

17:26.300 --> 17:28.500
you get angry all over again - anybody?

17:29.800 --> 17:32.000
Let's give Bradley a chance this time.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.800
My partner parked me in again.
I couldn't find the keys.

17:36.835 --> 17:39.300
I had to wake him up
and he starts yelling at me.

17:39.335 --> 17:41.000
Describe the feelings.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.800
My stepkids do that all the time.

17:43.900 --> 17:46.050
They leave their bikes in the garage

17:46.085 --> 17:48.200
and if I wanna pull in, I gotta get out

17:48.300 --> 17:50.665
and move the bikes
with a car full of groceries.

17:50.700 --> 17:54.500
Doris, can't you keep Billy's bike
out of the driveway?!

17:57.300 --> 18:00.300
It's a famous commercial from the '60s.
Bufferin.

18:00.335 --> 18:03.300
Guy has a headache
and he takes it out on his wife.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.265
Back to Bradley,

18:07.300 --> 18:10.500
I'm trying to get
into his physical sensations of anger.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.465
He saw red. Who wouldn't?

18:12.500 --> 18:14.365
She's right. Why is he in here?

18:14.400 --> 18:18.000
Why isn't his roommate in therapy
for selfishness issues?

18:18.100 --> 18:22.100
There are always things
that are irritating and out of our control.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.100
What we can control
is our response to those triggers.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.700
So people get a free pass...
the whole world?

18:27.735 --> 18:29.817
I told you about my supervisor...

18:29.852 --> 18:31.900
checking my work and nobody else's?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.100
- I wonder why.
- Cos you're a minority.

18:34.135 --> 18:36.700
Exactly. That's why I'm in here.

18:37.600 --> 18:41.500
- You seem angry about Evelyn's problem.
- It makes me mad.

18:41.535 --> 18:44.865
It doesn't make you mad.
You make you mad.

18:44.900 --> 18:47.865
I come from a biased family,
but I was different.

18:47.900 --> 18:51.100
I put all my faith and my hopes
into the civil rights movement.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.300
I left home and I marched.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.865
And for what?
So they could ride around in their SUVs,

18:56.900 --> 19:01.000
blasting that rap shit and you can't say
anything because they might have guns?

19:01.100 --> 19:03.265
Wait a fuckin' minute. Who's they?

19:03.300 --> 19:06.900
- If the shoe fits.
- This is fuckin' priceless.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.850
OK, let's not time-travel here,

19:08.885 --> 19:10.665
let's try to stay in the present.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.450
Janice, you're angry. Let's stay with that.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.200
What are your physical feelings right now?

19:16.235 --> 19:18.865
I'd like to punch you in the face.

19:18.900 --> 19:21.900
Your hands are clenched.
Did you realise that?

19:23.300 --> 19:25.465
You're provoking me to make a point.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.500
- Maybe that's your job but I don't like it.
- Look at you.

19:28.535 --> 19:31.617
- You're not even listening.
- He's talking to me.

19:31.652 --> 19:34.626
No. You and me, we do most
of the talking in here.

19:34.661 --> 19:37.600
The man is trying to say
that those people outside...

19:37.635 --> 19:39.265
they do the thing,

19:39.300 --> 19:42.300
but we're the ones that get
all upset and start carrying on.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.400
That's all he's saying.

19:48.900 --> 19:51.200
The Hudson Valley.

19:54.900 --> 19:58.800
That Legend of Sleepy Hollow cartoon
scared the piss outta me when I was a kid.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.300
Would you mind watching your shoe?

20:01.335 --> 20:03.600
Oh, sure.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.400
It's a $50,000 vehicle.
I don't want it scuffed up.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.065
Uncle Pat's farm?

20:19.100 --> 20:22.800
When you're 12, 13, man,
it's like fuckin' heaven, right?

20:24.200 --> 20:27.900
Running around in the woods,
driving that tractor.

20:29.300 --> 20:33.900
He made me clear the brush by the fence
with a fuckin' scythe, though.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.100
I had to do that. Tony too.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.500
And water his fuckin'
tomatoes and his basinigol'.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.150
Changed, though, you know, Pat's,

20:43.185 --> 20:45.665
after Louise came back there to live.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.500
It wasn't just you and Pat
and his great stories.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.500
They used to call me Ichabod Crane.

20:58.700 --> 21:01.800
- Who?
- Some very sorry people, that's who.

21:06.900 --> 21:11.600
The Carmela front? Did you two ever
discuss that evening you made love?

21:13.800 --> 21:17.600
It was a one-time deal. I've moved on.

21:17.700 --> 21:20.200
What about the depression?

21:22.300 --> 21:26.900
Your revelation
about your cousin, his prison sentence?

21:26.935 --> 21:29.800
You were very upset.

21:30.700 --> 21:34.100
Tell you the truth, I haven't had
a lot of time to think about that.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.100
My sister...

21:38.200 --> 21:44.200
She attacked some woman
at her stepkid's soccer game.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.665
You've mentioned her temper before.

21:46.700 --> 21:50.500
She got charged with aggravated assault
and resisting arrest.

21:50.535 --> 21:51.800
Excellent.

21:51.900 --> 21:53.500
Let's talk about that.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.000
- What?
- Rage.

21:56.100 --> 21:59.300
- Why?
- Depression is rage turned inward.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.350
Tell me about the Soprano temper.

22:04.385 --> 22:06.465
The thing is, it's bad for business.

22:06.500 --> 22:10.300
Clouds your judgment.
John, he always had a terrible temper.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.100
- John?
- Gotti.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.965
And in the end, I think it hurt him.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.300
See, we forget that in the old days, the ones
that came over, that started this thing,

22:19.400 --> 22:21.365
they didn't get mad.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.700
They just smiled and nodded
and made sure you got it later.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.665
That's the whole beautiful point.

22:27.700 --> 22:31.000
You know what they say.
Revenge is like serving cold cuts.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.450
I think it's, "Revenge is a dish
best served cold. "

22:35.485 --> 22:38.865
- So, what'd I say?
- But why revenge all the time?

22:38.900 --> 22:44.200
Where does it come from, this insatiable
anger you and your sister share?

22:44.235 --> 22:46.600
I was wondering when she'd come up?

22:46.700 --> 22:49.665
Your mother? What about your father?

22:49.700 --> 22:53.100
You never saw her
chop off someone's finger.

22:53.135 --> 22:56.500
- Told you about that, didn't I?
- Yes.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.850
- Jesus, I wish I hadn't.
- Why?

23:00.885 --> 23:03.100
I dress up nice when I come here...

23:03.200 --> 23:05.600
OK, let's stick to the subject.

23:05.700 --> 23:09.100
- Which is what?
- Your own intolerance for frustration.

23:13.200 --> 23:16.900
"Thank you for holding.
Your call is important to us. "

23:16.935 --> 23:19.465
If it's so important to you, answer the phone!

23:19.500 --> 23:23.300
- Stay with that.
- It's just a level of bullshit!

23:24.500 --> 23:28.900
Every fuckin' new idea they come up with
to make things better makes things worse.

23:28.935 --> 23:32.300
OK, right, I agree.
"The centre cannot hold.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.650
"The falcon cannot hear the falconer. "

23:34.685 --> 23:36.865
What the fuck are you talking about?

23:36.900 --> 23:41.100
We live in a time
of technological and spiritual crisis,

23:41.135 --> 23:43.200
but you feel you're above all of it,

23:43.300 --> 23:47.500
certainly above any
inconvenience or annoyance.

23:47.535 --> 23:49.800
And if things don't go your way,

23:49.900 --> 23:55.900
instead of being merely disappointed
or inconvenienced, you blow.

24:02.700 --> 24:05.200
My sister's...

24:05.300 --> 24:08.100
She's taking anger-management classes.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.165
Maybe she's on the right track.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.700
- Is this something you'd consider?
- No.

24:16.500 --> 24:20.500
But I'll admit it's not good for me,
all this fuckin' agitation.

24:22.400 --> 24:26.300
Wears me out.
I'm fuckin' exhausted all the time.

24:26.400 --> 24:30.200
- Where did we start off?
- I don't know.

24:30.235 --> 24:32.500
Depression is rage turned inward.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.900
This is nice.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.650
For inner-city kids like me,
this was important.

24:50.685 --> 24:53.665
You lived next
to the largest mall in New Jersey.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.765
It's over now. She's sticking me
in that home in Florida.

24:56.800 --> 25:00.300
- That's the last I'll ever see of her.
- I'll be right down the road.

25:00.335 --> 25:02.065
I got a beautiful condo.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.900
Thinks she's gonna meet
some old, lonely widower.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.700
Louise, it's time for dessert.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.400
I'm getting it.

25:17.600 --> 25:22.700
And do me a favour, be as polite as
you are when it's just the two of us?

25:29.800 --> 25:32.400
We know where Chrissy buried the guy.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.800
But with Uncle Johnny's,
you gotta help us out.

25:39.500 --> 25:42.750
I'm not exactly sure,
but there was two of them.

25:42.785 --> 25:46.000
- The Johnson brothers.
- You don't remember where?

25:48.100 --> 25:50.600
It was a long time ago.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.300
We can't excavate the whole fuckin' place.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.700
Cos you know
what Tony's gonna say?

25:56.735 --> 25:59.000
Let him come up here and dig then.

25:59.100 --> 26:02.500
Please. He's a heart attack waiting
to happen.

26:02.535 --> 26:06.200
That's no joke. Our bodies are 86% water.

26:06.300 --> 26:08.800
His last blood test, he was 65% zeppole.

26:14.400 --> 26:19.100
When he first heard the term "pie in the
sky," he volunteered for the 82nd Airborne.

26:19.135 --> 26:20.600
That's pretty good.

26:22.300 --> 26:26.900
I learned in recovery that he's just tamping
down his feelings by eating.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.165
I should talk to him. It's a shame, you know.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.400
- He was the funnest guy in the world.
- When was that?

26:37.900 --> 26:41.900
He's got the world by the balls and he acts
like everything's an imposition.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.900
Being at the top, he's isolated himself.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.300
Yeah, it's just him and his money.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.500
Hello.

27:08.800 --> 27:13.300
- Who is this guy, anyway?
- My first. Czechoslovakian guy.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.000
This is the second time I'm moving him.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.700
- Come here, you little fuck.
- Guys, wait.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.700
- Come here, you little fuck.
- It wasn't me...

27:40.500 --> 27:44.200
- Help! Please, don't kill me.
- What the fuck you running for?

27:46.200 --> 27:51.000
The night of the 12th, there was a ship from
Italy with these containers of Vespas.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.300
I don't know anything about any Vespas!

27:53.400 --> 27:56.000
We know they got here.
What happened to them?

27:56.100 --> 27:58.800
I don't know. I wasn't here!

27:59.600 --> 28:02.400
Well, apparently he says he wasn't here.

28:05.200 --> 28:10.700
Who picked up
our motherfuckin', cocksucking Vespas?

28:13.100 --> 28:16.765
In two seconds, this is going up your ass.

28:16.800 --> 28:20.500
It was the guys from New York.
Phil Leotardo and them.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.900
Listen.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.100
Thanks for doing this. You didn't have to.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.200
Fuck that. You're my little cousin.

28:53.100 --> 28:56.300
I think I can imagine what you may
be hearing about me

28:56.400 --> 28:58.300
and what happened in New York.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.600
All I can say is, there's no truth to it.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.800
I didn't think nothing.

29:02.900 --> 29:06.500
And Tony putting me in at the casino,
I knew people would resent that.

29:07.100 --> 29:10.500
But I went away for a long time,
stood up for this family,

29:10.535 --> 29:13.300
and you, or anybody,
can think what they like,

29:13.335 --> 29:15.400
but I feel I had a little coming to me.

29:15.500 --> 29:19.400
Absolutely. I was telling Benny that
the other day. He was complaining.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.300
And what I said about Tony before?

29:21.400 --> 29:25.400
- You know I love him like a brother.
- I love him, too.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.800
We saw the guy down the pier.
John has the Vespas.

30:12.700 --> 30:17.600
To think of how supportive you were of him.
That whole Little Carmine fiasco.

30:17.700 --> 30:19.265
It's fuckin' payback.

30:19.300 --> 30:22.800
Johnny's got it in his head my cousin
had something to do with Joey.

30:22.835 --> 30:25.900
Johnny should be looking for the real killers

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
instead of spending
all his time on that golf course.

30:31.500 --> 30:34.500
Whole fuckin' shipment
of cheese coming in next month.

30:34.535 --> 30:36.565
The imported provolone.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.800
I guess we can kiss that goodbye too now,
right?

30:47.100 --> 30:48.300
Motherfucker!

31:07.900 --> 31:10.900
- What are you doing here?
- My son is a senior here now.

31:10.935 --> 31:14.100
We were electing party
chairs for a senior night.

31:14.135 --> 31:15.500
Right.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.700
- So, how are you?
- Fine.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.800
Cos you were pretty
upset when you left and I wanted to call.

31:21.900 --> 31:24.565
I began to really rue what happened...

31:24.600 --> 31:28.600
- I'm going back with my husband.
- Oh, that's good.

31:29.900 --> 31:31.600
All the best.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.700
You don't drink no more?

31:50.800 --> 31:53.300
Clean and sober, 14 months.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.100
Yeah, your mother has that problem.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.700
Good for you.

32:13.300 --> 32:16.100
- That's right.
- What?

32:17.400 --> 32:19.800
The Johnson brothers' bodies.

32:19.900 --> 32:22.000
I know where they are.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.865
Over by the fence in the northwest corner,

32:27.900 --> 32:30.365
because that night
I noticed one of my pickers

32:30.400 --> 32:35.265
had stuck a Swiss Colony bottle
upside-down on one of the fenceposts.

32:35.300 --> 32:39.200
And I was plenty goddamn mad they were
drinking on the job, I'll tell you.

32:39.300 --> 32:41.500
It's still there, the glass bottle.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.700
- Are you fuckin' sure?
- Lunch!

32:46.000 --> 32:48.200
- I got for you, Chrissy.
- Thank you.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.300
Sandwich?

32:56.900 --> 32:58.300
Beautiful.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.200
This is mail from three fuckin' weeks ago.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.000
- The girl didn't even show up today.
- Why don't you get somebody new?

33:09.035 --> 33:12.067
Two classes, she's telling
people how to run their life.

33:12.102 --> 33:15.100
Don't let me stop you
from taking your kids to the rink.

33:25.900 --> 33:30.100
You have every right
to be mad at me, and I apologise.

33:31.200 --> 33:36.600
I know it's bad for the family...
for business... but I'm working on it.

33:41.100 --> 33:43.400
Yeah, I know. Bobby told me.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.500
- So how's that going?
- Anger management?

33:49.600 --> 33:52.000
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

33:52.100 --> 33:55.600
It's such a relief to let go
of all that shit and...

33:55.635 --> 33:58.300
I never realised what
an angry person I was

33:58.400 --> 34:00.265
and how it fed itself.

34:00.300 --> 34:03.800
- So they got you on tranquillisers?
- No.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.100
Basically, it's taking responsibility
for your anger,

34:09.135 --> 34:12.665
and learning to recognise
your feelings of anger

34:12.699 --> 34:16.699
and that they're just feelings,
you don't have to act on them.

34:16.735 --> 34:19.300
People want that
so they can walk all over you.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.900
A lot of anger is self-importance.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.550
- Self-importance?
- Problems with authority.

34:25.585 --> 34:29.065
Dr Seepman locks the door
promptly at seven.

34:29.100 --> 34:34.100
People wig out if they don't get in, start
banging on the door. It's a big lesson.

34:36.100 --> 34:38.764
I was making everybody
in my life miserable,

34:38.800 --> 34:42.900
yelling and screaming,
or pouting and feeling victimised,

34:42.935 --> 34:46.617
but I feel so much better
now about everything.

34:46.652 --> 34:50.300
It's like this great sadness
is beginning to lift.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.800
- Sadness?
- Yeah.

34:57.400 --> 35:00.600
- Well, I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.600
I am.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.400
Your bid, Chrissy.

35:33.100 --> 35:35.200
You expecting someone?

35:36.600 --> 35:38.300
There he is!

35:39.500 --> 35:41.800
My God, I don't believe it.

35:41.835 --> 35:44.300
Who's that... Anthony?

35:49.800 --> 35:52.000
What's the matter? You all right?

35:52.600 --> 35:54.500
God, you're big.

35:57.300 --> 35:59.000
Look at those shoulders.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.765
- Jan sends her love and Barb, too.
- Did you eat?

36:01.800 --> 36:06.100
Louise, don't ask him. He's a guest.
Just go get him a plate!

36:06.600 --> 36:08.465
Sit down.

36:08.500 --> 36:12.100
- You look good.
- Feel good.

36:13.900 --> 36:16.100
So how we doing?

36:16.600 --> 36:20.200
Took care of mine last night.
The Johnson brothers we'll get tonight.

36:21.400 --> 36:25.500
Uncle Pat was like Johnny Mnemonic.
Right, Uncle Pat?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.800
We're playing pinochle.
Take a hand.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.900
- This is the life, huh?
- I'm with you.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.800
Yeah, we were just saying that.

37:25.100 --> 37:27.500
To a job well done.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.465
This place hasn't changed much.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.700
Met some pretty nice college girls
the other night.

37:38.735 --> 37:40.900
She liked you, Miss Raven-Hair?

37:43.400 --> 37:45.300
Pat seems good, huh?

37:47.000 --> 37:49.400
Louise seems fat.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.065
The human body is 86% water,

37:57.100 --> 38:00.100
but Louise's last blood test,
she was 65% zeppole.

38:05.100 --> 38:06.800
That's a good one.

38:08.200 --> 38:11.265
I knew a guy, when he was gonna eat
Philly cheese steak,

38:11.300 --> 38:15.300
the mayor of Philly would have
to call out the National Guard.

38:17.200 --> 38:21.200
What the fuck's so funny about that?
Doesn't even make sense.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.050
- Well, he's drunk.
- Him?

38:26.085 --> 38:28.500
No way. He's in recovery.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.200
If you recover
your fuckin' balls, give us a call.

38:33.235 --> 38:35.300
We might like to hang out.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.300
No, seriously, it's not funny.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.865
He's a 12-stepper, right?

38:39.900 --> 38:42.300
Well, yeah. You know that. That's right.

38:43.400 --> 38:48.100
Maybe he can take another couple of steps
out the door so we could have some fun?

38:49.900 --> 38:53.500
Come on, don't get pissy now.
He's just having a joke, that's all.

38:55.100 --> 38:58.500
Sobriety's hard enough
without having to get mocked for it.

38:58.535 --> 39:01.100
Jesus Christ,
why don't you have a fuckin' drink?

39:01.200 --> 39:03.850
You're driving
everybody crazy with this shit.

39:03.885 --> 39:06.500
The fuckin' Higher Power
yammering and the sweets

39:06.535 --> 39:09.400
and the Key lime pie and the... Jesus.

39:11.300 --> 39:14.700
Order a fuckin' bullshot,
will you? Do me a favour.

39:23.500 --> 39:28.700
I'm sorry, I didn't realise
I was being a jerkoff.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.800
Look, it's just... you know, come on.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.300
You're doing the right thing.

39:45.100 --> 39:47.265
So, how do you like his car?

39:47.300 --> 39:49.700
Schwarzenegger's. Pretty great, huh?

39:49.735 --> 39:52.865
The humvee. Yeah, it's nice.

39:52.900 --> 39:55.500
- Kinda steep.
- You told me you didn't pay for it.

39:55.600 --> 39:59.100
- You gave the guy a hum-job.
- For the hum-vee.

39:59.135 --> 40:01.465
Maybe he'd like to hum me.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.300
- A friend of Bill over here?
- Fuckin' wits over here.

40:04.335 --> 40:06.800
Bill? I'll say.

40:06.900 --> 40:09.700
That? That's not a bill, that's a beak.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.600
You know...

40:11.700 --> 40:16.400
that was you he made
that joke about, the zeppole content.

40:19.200 --> 40:22.150
On the way home,
we can drop him off at Beakskill.

40:22.185 --> 40:25.100
Well, if beaks could kill,
that one certainly would.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.600
I could've called you
Ichabod Crane, but I didn't.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.200
What the fuck's he talking about...
Ichabod Crane?

40:37.800 --> 40:39.900
Nothin'.

40:45.600 --> 40:50.200
Here's to the Johnson brothers,
whoever the fuck they were.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.300
...Port Newark...

41:11.800 --> 41:13.865
...but one example.

41:13.900 --> 41:17.365
Six million containers
enter U.S. ports every year,

41:17.400 --> 41:22.400
yet fewer than two per cent of them
are opened and inspected by U.S. Customs.

41:22.500 --> 41:25.200
It is impossible to check every container

41:25.300 --> 41:28.000
without essentially stopping
global commerce.

41:28.035 --> 41:30.667
But what keeps officials
from sleeping at night

41:30.702 --> 41:33.300
is that terrorists could use
shipping containers

41:33.400 --> 41:36.665
to smuggle in a weapon
of mass destruction.

41:36.700 --> 41:39.850
It is within the capabilities
of Islamic fundamentalists

41:39.885 --> 41:42.965
to track a container
with a Global Positioning System

41:43.000 --> 41:46.800
and detonate a nuclear
or biological weapon hidden inside.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.300
Son of a bitch.

41:48.400 --> 41:53.100
A terrorist could use a shipping container
to smuggle himself into the country.

41:56.300 --> 41:58.500
There he is.

42:00.200 --> 42:04.900
What I saw on TV last night.
The ports are wide open.

42:04.935 --> 42:07.065
Government's not doing shit.

42:07.100 --> 42:09.900
- Where's my butter substitute?
- In front of you.

42:09.935 --> 42:12.665
Didn't you hear what I said?
I knew it was bad.

42:12.700 --> 42:16.800
Seven million containers. The news team
put radioactive shit in one of 'em.

42:16.835 --> 42:19.900
- It wasn't even detected.
- Please, my ears.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.265
Sit down. Sit.

42:22.300 --> 42:24.500
Come on. I made eggs.

42:26.900 --> 42:28.900
Could've been a goddamn A-bomb.

42:28.935 --> 42:30.900
- You want coffee?
- Yeah.

42:33.700 --> 42:35.265
Fuckin' terrible nightmares.

42:35.300 --> 42:38.700
Yeah, it knocked the edge
right the hell off your appetite.

42:41.100 --> 42:44.200
- What's the matter with you?
- No, it is some scary shit.

42:45.100 --> 42:47.100
Not my problem much longer.

42:48.100 --> 42:51.000
Speaking of scary shit,
was that you in the bathroom?

42:51.100 --> 42:55.400
Oh, yeah. I thought they already dropped
the biological weapon.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.500
All right, I gotta go.

43:02.200 --> 43:04.065
I thought we were gonna go hunting.

43:04.100 --> 43:07.500
- You hear the turkeys this morning?
- No, I gotta take off.

43:07.600 --> 43:10.865
Uncle Pat. Take care of yourself.

43:10.900 --> 43:14.900
- Be careful of the alligators down there.
- All right, tough guy.

43:51.200 --> 43:54.600
Hey, Tone! What'd you do,
knock over a roadside stand?

43:54.700 --> 43:58.300
My uncle's farm.
Less than 100 miles from here.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.900
It's like a whole different world.

44:02.600 --> 44:05.100
The bullshit really falls away up there.

44:16.300 --> 44:18.300
Hear about that shit with the ports?

44:18.400 --> 44:22.500
Customs agents are bad for us, but
antiterrorism-wise, they're doing nothing.

44:22.600 --> 44:25.665
What's it gonna take,
a fuckin' nuclear bomb?

44:25.700 --> 44:28.800
They caught one al-Quaeda cocksucker
in one container.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.600
- They caught him.
- There's enough they don't catch.

44:31.700 --> 44:34.400
The administration's busy too,

44:34.500 --> 44:37.500
giving noncompetitive
building contracts to friends.

44:37.535 --> 44:40.900
Hell, we can all understand that.

44:42.100 --> 44:43.865
We're sitting ducks here.

44:43.900 --> 44:47.500
Only thing between our homes
and Port Newark is a chain-link fence.

44:47.535 --> 44:51.200
They get a nuclear bomb in a container
and we're fuckin' dead.

44:51.235 --> 44:54.000
That's why you gotta live for today.

44:55.100 --> 44:58.900
- What'd you say?
- That's why you gotta live for today.

44:58.935 --> 45:01.600
Talking about annihilation,
you stupid fuck!

45:01.700 --> 45:05.000
Your kids, my kids, burning into cinders!

45:05.035 --> 45:07.800
I can't even think about it.

45:07.900 --> 45:09.300
You stupid...

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
Can't even fuckin' think about it?
Motherfucker, huh?

45:17.100 --> 45:19.365
Think about it now?

45:19.400 --> 45:21.300
- How about now?
- Hey, Tony!

45:21.335 --> 45:22.865
Tony, take it easy.

45:22.900 --> 45:26.100
- Take a walk.
- Get some air.

45:26.200 --> 45:28.200
Take a walk.
Take a walk outside.

45:28.300 --> 45:30.500
Sorry, everybody.

45:33.100 --> 45:35.400
Come on, take it easy.

45:50.100 --> 45:51.665
- I wake you up?
- Yeah.

45:51.700 --> 45:53.600
I just come from the hospital.

45:53.635 --> 45:55.500
They said you wanted to know.

45:55.535 --> 45:58.000
Oh, how's he doing?

46:03.300 --> 46:05.400
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

46:06.700 --> 46:08.900
Doctor has a peel at one.

46:08.935 --> 46:11.100
- Hi.
- How you doing, hon?

46:12.100 --> 46:14.800
- Call me?
- Yeah.

46:16.100 --> 46:19.265
- Bye.
- See you later.

46:19.300 --> 46:21.700
- That the dermatology nurse?
- Yeah.

46:21.800 --> 46:26.000
- Nice-looking.
- They get all the skin treatments half-price.

46:30.500 --> 46:34.365
So, what'd they say?
He's gonna be OK, the kid?

46:34.400 --> 46:38.400
He's big, strapping, he'll be all right,
but some hearing loss, one ear.

46:38.500 --> 46:40.365
Looks like it could be permanent.

46:40.400 --> 46:43.500
Skip, the poor fuck knows
he should keep his mouth shut.

46:48.500 --> 46:50.600
Go over there.

46:50.700 --> 46:53.000
You make sure he gets the best.

47:00.900 --> 47:03.300
Thing is, Tone, he's quitting the Bing.

47:03.400 --> 47:04.800
And he told Sil, he goes,

47:04.900 --> 47:07.300
"I'd appreciate if Tony don't come visit me. "

47:07.400 --> 47:09.500
He don't wanna see you.

47:10.900 --> 47:13.300
I told him watch his mouth.

47:13.400 --> 47:15.465
These things happen, T.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.400
That's why I don't like to talk politics.

47:28.600 --> 47:32.300
- You did?
- Please, I couldn't believe it myself.

47:32.335 --> 47:35.565
- Well, are you going back with Tony?
- No.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.700
- Then why'd you say it?
- I don't know. It just came out.

47:38.735 --> 47:40.300
Asshole. He was gonna call me.

47:40.400 --> 47:42.700
- Did he?
- Jerk.

47:44.100 --> 47:46.000
Come in!

47:50.800 --> 47:52.300
Uncle Pat.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.865
- Where's AJ?
- He's not coming.

47:55.900 --> 47:58.800
You lose 'em for a little bit,
but he'll be back.

47:58.835 --> 48:00.200
Hi, Uncle Tone!

48:11.200 --> 48:13.400
- Before dinner?
- Half?

48:16.300 --> 48:17.665
Thank you.

48:17.700 --> 48:20.900
Mahatma Gandhi over here. Nice.

48:23.900 --> 48:25.600
I thought I heard your voice.

48:25.700 --> 48:27.465
- Hello?
- Good game on later.

48:27.500 --> 48:29.750
I think we're on the do-not-call list.

48:29.785 --> 48:31.965
Oh, no, we're happy with our service.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.600
Those telemarketers...
just hang up, hang up!

48:34.635 --> 48:37.500
We're just sitting down to dinner.

48:37.535 --> 48:39.800
OK, please don't call again.

48:39.900 --> 48:41.700
Thank you.

48:45.500 --> 48:47.400
Come on!

48:53.200 --> 48:57.065
It's a G5. It's got a 64-bit architecture.

48:57.100 --> 48:59.765
A different language
now with these computers.

48:59.800 --> 49:03.200
I saw a show on computers,
how the prices have dropped so low

49:03.235 --> 49:05.300
that you can buy one
for $500 at Costco

49:05.400 --> 49:09.200
more powerful than the one that put
the astronauts on the moon.

49:10.400 --> 49:12.200
Good eggplant, Jan.

49:14.200 --> 49:15.700
Yeah, delicious.

49:23.300 --> 49:26.700
I wonder where Harpo's
eating his Sunday dinner.

49:28.300 --> 49:29.700
What?

49:32.100 --> 49:33.965
Just wondering what Harpo's up to.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.100
- Who's Harpo?
- That's Hal, Janice's son.

49:37.200 --> 49:39.500
- You have a son?
- You didn't tell us that.

49:47.200 --> 49:48.900
You know that song,

49:49.000 --> 49:52.300
Harpo's Song by Phoebe Snow?

49:52.400 --> 49:56.000
That's the song
you named Harpo after, right?

49:57.000 --> 49:59.400
He's half
French-Canadian, Harpo.

49:59.500 --> 50:02.500
All right, Tony.
Make fun of a boy because of his name.

50:10.200 --> 50:14.300
I wonder what's French-Canadian
for "I grew up without a mother. "

50:20.400 --> 50:23.100
Where is my mama?

50:24.500 --> 50:27.300
You son of a fuckin' bitch!

50:27.335 --> 50:29.500
Daddy!

50:29.600 --> 50:31.900
- Easy, easy, easy!
- You miserable fuck!

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
I don't got a right to ask?
I'm the boy's uncle.

50:35.035 --> 50:36.600
Easy, easy.

50:41.400 --> 50:43.700
- Easy.
- I hate him, I hate him.

52:56.800 --> 52:57.800
