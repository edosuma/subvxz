00:02.236 --> 00:02.936
- Girls today can be anything.

CEO, Olympic gold medalist,

00:07.475 --> 00:10.478
even a Supreme Court Justice.

00:10.511 --> 00:14.048
We've finally broken
that glass ceiling, and, wow,

00:14.082 --> 00:15.549
sure looks good from the top.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.086
[Selena Gomez's

00:18.119 --> 00:20.521
- * I'm trying, I'm trying,
oh, trying *

00:20.554 --> 00:22.456
- Hey, go brush your teeth.
Wipe her face.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.158
Did you find your homework?

00:24.192 --> 00:26.160
And you, my little friend,
you need pants.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.828
- Mom.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.430
Can I stay home
from school today?

00:29.463 --> 00:31.632
- Nobody's staying home.
- I feel sick.

00:31.665 --> 00:34.068
- My spleen.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.636
Specificity is good,
but that's over the top.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.238
Next time try tummy.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.506
- It's go time.
Let's go.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.141
- Okay, everyone's going
to school.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.842
Mommy has something important
to do.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.444
- Oh, look.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.446
- Guys, look, Daddy's
on TV again.

00:47.315 --> 00:50.118
A pig to fly?

00:51.252 --> 00:52.420
- All right, let's go.
Line up.

00:52.453 --> 00:53.554
- Love you.
- Train's leaving.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.289
- Love you.
Love you.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.291
- Bags in the back.

00:57.325 --> 00:58.859
- Love you.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.129
*

01:01.162 --> 01:02.363
- Love you.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.398
- Tuna fish.
Keep it in the fridge.

01:04.432 --> 01:07.235
*

01:07.268 --> 01:09.437
- Stop, stop, stop,
Mom!

01:11.372 --> 01:13.574
- You make your dad drop you
off all the way back here?

01:13.607 --> 01:16.210
- I don't know.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.613
- Porsche Turbo.

01:21.482 --> 01:24.252
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Did you need this?

01:26.354 --> 01:27.455
*

01:27.488 --> 01:29.290
Love you, Sadie.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.660
- Come on, did those kids
take it again?

01:32.693 --> 01:36.164
God, those douchebags.
It was a 20.

01:36.197 --> 01:39.500
- Well, small price to pay for
the bone structure of my face.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.535
- That's very true.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.604
- * Oh, baby, let's make

01:43.637 --> 01:45.373
- I don't want to leave you
without cash.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.508
- Excuse me, who is
the adult here?

01:47.541 --> 01:50.110
Don't answer that.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.481
- So why aren't there any
of these awesome women

01:53.514 --> 01:55.283
in my history book, huh?

01:55.316 --> 01:56.584
I'll tell you why.

01:56.617 --> 02:00.621
Sister made the mistake
of getting her period.

02:00.654 --> 02:04.358
They say behind every great man
there's a great woman.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.261
Well, I say that's some bull
right there.

02:07.295 --> 02:10.198
'Cause none of these nasty
women I just told you about

02:10.231 --> 02:11.632
stood behind men.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.667
- They stood right beside them.

02:13.701 --> 02:17.205
So we gotta get it done
ourselves, ladies, am I right?

02:17.238 --> 02:20.408
- You get it, girl!
You. Get. It.

02:20.441 --> 02:23.677
- We gonna burn
this patriarchy down!

02:23.711 --> 02:25.513
- Whoo!

02:29.350 --> 02:31.219
- Okay.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.254
- Okay, I'm out of here.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.522
You got an early shift?

02:34.555 --> 02:36.224
- Um.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.958
I figured, you know,
we could use the extra.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.593
- Hm, I figured the same thing

02:39.627 --> 02:41.362
'cause I'm about to pull
a double at the mall.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.496
- I can make it work.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.665
- You always do, boo.

02:44.698 --> 02:48.702
- * And, oh, baby,
let's make reality *

02:48.736 --> 02:50.938
* Actuality

02:50.971 --> 02:52.673
* A reality

02:52.706 --> 02:57.211
* Oh, baby,
let's make reality *

02:57.245 --> 02:58.679
* Actuality

02:58.712 --> 03:00.681
* A reality

03:00.714 --> 03:05.286
* Oh, I'm trying, I'm trying,
I'm trying, I'm trying *

03:05.319 --> 03:06.687
- I cannot believe you.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.723
- Chill, sis.
I'm like two minutes late.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.430
How was Sara's thing?
- Oh, she was so good.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.765
- She's so smart.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.301
I worry about mine.
Stop it.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.735
- All right, you all ready
for this?

03:21.769 --> 03:23.737
- Now or never.
- Let's do it.

03:25.706 --> 03:30.278
- All right, everybody be cool,
and nobody gets hurt.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.581
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a robbery.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.524
- Oh! My lord.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.795
Maybe we don't have
to do the full Brazilian.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.663
- Oh, Brazilian would put you
in the hospital.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.533
This is just brush control.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.269
- Yeah, I probably don't get
in here as much as I used to.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.305
No.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.872
- My husband and I
aren't having a lot

03:58.906 --> 04:00.774
of S-E-X right now.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.544
- Maybe he just can't find it.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.546
- Kids are back to school.
I'm swamped.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.948
He's always working late.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.051
Plus there's so much on the
DVR--it's really kind of hard

04:11.084 --> 04:12.853
to sched--ow!

04:12.886 --> 04:15.022
Okay!

04:15.055 --> 04:16.824
Your card was declined.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.960
- I ran it twice.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.729
- I'm sure he just...

04:21.762 --> 04:22.930
Forgot to pay the bill.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.332
He's been
very distracted lately.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.799
- Hey , there.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.302
Amber here over
at Boland Motors.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.704
We've got Chevys.
We've got Fords.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.906
We've got Chryslers, too.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.609
Have we got the car for you?

04:35.643 --> 04:37.378
Do you think I could
make it in LA?

04:37.411 --> 04:39.079
The right price to boot.
- Mmm, mm-hmm.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.881
- It's not like Michigan.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.683
They have really good
actresses there.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.719
- And you're gonna win
one of those fancy awards.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.755
Like a People's Choice.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.089
- I don't need all that.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.924
I just want to be super famous.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.826
So come on down
to Boland Motors

04:52.860 --> 04:53.994
where we'll put
the vroom, vroom, vroom

04:54.027 --> 04:55.896
back in your engine.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.637
- Annie Bananey.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.806
Hey, you, uh, you got
any plans later?

05:05.839 --> 05:08.776
My church is having
a bring a friend night.

05:08.809 --> 05:13.714
- You know, I'm just not really
much of a church person.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.716
You're definitely
a stuck up bitch.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.686
I'm just kidding ya.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.855
Now, see, the old me totally
would have meant that, but...

05:21.889 --> 05:23.924
Born again Boomer don't judge.

05:25.993 --> 05:31.064
This came from your register
last night.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.900
Know what it is?

05:32.933 --> 05:35.002
- Hmm, this is a tough one.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.737
It's a curling iron?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.906
- We in the biz say
counterfeit.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.374
Yeah, see, I know
it's counterfeit

05:40.408 --> 05:42.610
because I used the pen.
Did you us the pen?

05:42.643 --> 05:43.911
- Boomer, I don't remember
if I used--

05:43.944 --> 05:45.413
- I'm guessing you didn't
because, if you had,

05:45.446 --> 05:46.614
you would have known
it's counterfeit

05:46.647 --> 05:47.915
which is why we have the pen.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.417
So unfortunately
I'm gonna have to dock this

05:49.450 --> 05:51.752
from your paycheck.
- Whoa, whoa.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.421
Wait, Boomer, that's like
a whole shift for me.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.756
- Well, maybe next time you'll
take security more seriously.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.670
- Excuse me, how much
longer is the wait?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.672
'Cause we've been...

06:15.709 --> 06:17.110
- What I'm most concerned
about right now

06:17.144 --> 06:18.912
is Stella's
kidney function.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.448
- Sara.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.715
- You said Stella.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.183
Her name's Sara.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.654
Okay, so what
about her kidneys?

06:26.687 --> 06:29.156
- One is failing, the other
one's right behind.

06:29.189 --> 06:32.493
I would suggest
that we put Sara

06:32.526 --> 06:35.463
on the list for a transplant
as soon as possible.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.931
- Carla, you just can't throw
files like this.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.834
- But we just got ten walk-ins.
- I've been doing some reading.

06:40.868 --> 06:41.935
- Okay.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.804
- 'Cause she can barely make it

06:43.837 --> 06:45.072
through the school day
right now 'cause--

06:45.105 --> 06:47.074
- It's all willy-nilly
over there.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.909
- She can barely make it
through the day

06:48.942 --> 06:50.711
let alone soccer.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.946
- You might want to keep
her home and get a tutor.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.515
Are those last week's
blood draws?

06:54.548 --> 06:56.216
- My husband and I work
all the time.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.752
So we can't.
- Here, Carla.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.187
Take them all away.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.223
- And the transplant list
can take months right?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.893
- Separate.
Thank you.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.761
- And there's this new drug

07:07.795 --> 07:09.530
that just got approved.
- Take everything out.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.931
Oh, my God, can you please

07:10.964 --> 07:14.935
just listen to me
for one damn minute?

07:14.968 --> 07:17.705
Shame on you.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.973
Shame on all of you.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.544
*

07:23.577 --> 07:25.879
- Eculizumab.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.749
That's the name of the drug
you're talking about.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.083
- Yes.
- It does.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.753
It improves renal function
dramatically.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.955
It's also ten grand a month
out of pocket.

07:34.988 --> 07:38.158
And I'm guessing that may not
be an option.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.127
*

07:40.160 --> 07:42.029
- Well, I'll talk
to my husband.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.997
We might be able to swing it.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.967
- Okay.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.236
- And she was only halfway
through my wax.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.573
- Well, now I'm very uneven.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.809
- Okay.
I don't even want to know.

07:55.843 --> 07:59.112
- Dean maxed out their credit
card at some lingerie store.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.748
- Do you think
he's sleeping around?

08:00.781 --> 08:02.015
- Don't nobody want Dean.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.884
It's a Christmas gift.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.252
- Maybe it's
your anniversary present.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.286
- He already gave me
100 coupons

08:06.319 --> 08:07.821
to Bed Bath & Beyond.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.123
- Son of a bitch.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.892
- No, I really do love it
there.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.528
- No, that old guy
is stealing your tip.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.165
- He can't even walk.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.933
- Go get it.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.779
- Shady S.O.B.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.614
- Shady.
- Mm-hmm.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.115
- At my old job we got robbed
all the time

08:35.148 --> 08:36.850
so I got the sixth sense now.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.318
- I mean it's no big deal.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.053
All the stores I work
at eventually get hit.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.556
- You could get shot.
- Ugh, one can hope.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.191
These guys, they don't want
to hurt anybody.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.926
They just want the money
so we let them have it.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.127
Nobody's trying to be a hero.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.330
- Yeah, the dumb ones do
'cause they park

08:50.363 --> 08:52.099
in the front
by the security cameras.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.266
You got to put your getaway car

08:53.300 --> 08:55.035
in the back
by the loading dock.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.336
And you never dick around
with the registers.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.305
The real money is back
in the vault.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.340
- You've really worked
this out.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.110
- Just keeping my options open.

09:04.612 --> 09:07.214
- 30 grand, give or take.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.583
- Damn, I could use that money.

09:09.617 --> 09:12.019
- Oh, my God, me too.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.089
- Well, I already bought
three automatics

09:16.123 --> 09:17.625
and filed off
the serial numbers

09:17.658 --> 09:20.160
so really, name a day.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.867
You should see your face.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.269
- It's whiter than usual.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.271
- I'm gonna need you all
to get on the ground

09:31.304 --> 09:33.140
get your cell phones out
of your pockets,

09:33.173 --> 09:34.875
and keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.243
All right, good.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.979
Now, I need to you to get
your manager up here.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.949
*

09:41.982 --> 09:44.351
I said you need to get
a manager up here right now.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.328
I better get
a manager up here right now

09:55.362 --> 09:58.666
or I will start capping people,
and I'm not even joking.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.700
Mother--

10:01.268 --> 10:03.203
Are you the manager?
- Over there.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.905
- Hey.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.273
Hey, you. You!

10:06.306 --> 10:09.710
You, squirmy!
Hey, hey, hey!

10:09.743 --> 10:11.278
Are you in charge here?

10:11.311 --> 10:13.180
- Yes. Yes, I am.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.015
- Okay, then you
listen to me.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.984
You're gonna put
on your big boy panties

10:17.017 --> 10:18.886
and you're gonna tell
your customers to stay calm

10:18.919 --> 10:20.888
and this will be over
real soon.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.122
- Get out of there.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.292
- Now you're going to take
my friend here

10:25.325 --> 10:27.294
to the cash vault.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.898
- Move it before I shoot
your face off--let's go!

10:30.931 --> 10:33.033
Now, now, now!

10:35.468 --> 10:38.405
Oh, my God.

10:38.438 --> 10:41.374
- Hey, Deadpool, you wanna...

10:45.412 --> 10:45.779
.

10:48.716 --> 10:51.084
*

10:51.118 --> 10:52.920
- Ugh.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.894
Seriously?
- You won't call me back.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.830
- I was busy.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.431
- So here I am.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.433
- Well, I'm pretty sure
I'm supposed to be helping

11:06.466 --> 11:08.869
customers not chatting
with my ex, so.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.071
- So, now I'm a customer.

11:15.776 --> 11:20.447
Nancy and I are suing
you for custody.

11:23.784 --> 11:24.985
- There's a hearing next month.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.920
You should probably
get yourself a lawyer.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.790
- You know if you sign up now
you get 10% off your purchase.

11:29.823 --> 11:34.027
- Annie, we were 17
when we decided all this stuff.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.963
Sadie would be happier
with us now.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.167
- We could send her
to private school, St. Anne's.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.803
- She's an atheist
who enjoys a jaunty bow tie.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.005
I don't really think that
Catholic school is a good fit.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.740
- We could get her therapy.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.075
- She doesn't need therapy.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.843
She's figuring out who she is.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.179
- That's all great, but
she's getting bullied, Annie.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.115
- Yes, by dickhead kids
that need therapy.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.188
It's after midnight.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.924
- The neighborhood girl.
She's very good.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.095
- She lives
within walking distance.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.897
- I'm buying her
a new computer.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.199
Hers has been broken
for a month.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.037
- Because she said she didn't
want to freak you out.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.077
I mean it's
a victimless crime.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.512
The store is insured.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.114
Plus, you know they make us
work through lunch

12:27.147 --> 12:28.949
so it's basically tit for tat

12:28.982 --> 12:30.117
when you figure
in the lost wages.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.785
- Oh, that will hold up
in court.

12:31.819 --> 12:32.786
- Hey, no pop

12:32.820 --> 12:34.087
before dinner, sweetie.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.488
- But she gets it.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.090
- That's because I am
a grown up.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.525
- Technically.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.027
- Okay, you know,
can't you just have my back

12:40.060 --> 12:41.929
on, like, one thing ever?

12:41.962 --> 12:45.032
- This isn't me telling Mom
and Dad that you smoked pot.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.134
- Which was incredibly lame,
by the way.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.037
- This is me helping you
not ruin your life.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.207
- Oh, because your life
is so great.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.009
I should want this life?

12:56.043 --> 12:58.245
- I didn't say that.
- You're like the Stepford mom

12:58.278 --> 12:59.913
without a pulse.
- I never said that.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.882
- You're cutting
chicken fingers into stars.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.884
They're already fingers.

13:05.853 --> 13:09.857
And, I mean, not to pile on,
but look who you married.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.992
- It's 20 years
and four children.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.261
Marriage sometimes
takes a little work.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.865
- Wow. That is so romantic.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.267
- You could lose your daughter.
Has that occurred to you?

13:21.935 --> 13:24.604
- Well seeing as Greg
is suing me for custody

13:24.637 --> 13:26.539
and I can't afford
to fight it,

13:26.573 --> 13:31.211
yes, actually, the thought
has crossed my mind.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.080
- I didn't know.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.184
- Now you know.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.886
- Hey, there, Amber here

13:38.919 --> 13:40.520
over at Boland Motors.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.891
- Jeez, who'd this chick
have to blow to get on TV?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.492
- Around town.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.228
So what are you waiting for?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.597
A pig to fly?

13:51.965 --> 13:54.101
So come on down
to Boland Motors

13:54.134 --> 13:55.635
where we'll put
the vroom, vroom, vroom

13:55.668 --> 13:58.005
back in your engine.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.508
- Mm, they took away
her license.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.476
She's always home.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.078
- It's this charge right here.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.580
Could you just tell me exactly
what was bought?

14:07.614 --> 14:09.616
- It's against policy
to divulge information

14:09.649 --> 14:13.053
on previous purchases
for privacy concerns.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.956
- Oh, but it's--
it's on her bill, so.

14:15.989 --> 14:19.226
- They she should remember
what she bought.

14:19.259 --> 14:22.963
- Well, I remember
that I bought it for a friend.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.564
And she loved it so much.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.633
She really went nuts for it.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.136
Um...

14:29.169 --> 14:33.273
But then she was
in an accident.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.909
- With a driver texting.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.244
- Yeah, well it was
the other driver texting.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.612
Not my friend.
She would never do that.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.049
But anyway, she's been
in a coma ever since

14:42.082 --> 14:43.650
and her brain is like

14:43.683 --> 14:46.086
ten times the size
it should be.

14:46.119 --> 14:49.022
Um, I just thought, wouldn't it
be a nice gesture

14:49.056 --> 14:50.357
if she wakes up--
- Hey, when she wakes up.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.125
Stay positive.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.127
- To have her favorite pair
of undies waiting.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.963
'Cause she was actually
wearing the last pair

14:55.996 --> 14:57.564
when she got in the accident.
- Mm-hmm.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.167
Mm-hmm, and the paramedics
had to cut them

15:00.200 --> 15:03.570
off of her, you know,
jaws of life style.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.273
- Darn it if I cannot remember
the size that I got.

15:06.306 --> 15:10.077
And I obviously feel stupid
asking her family.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.012
- No, can't do that.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.313
- Okay! Just...

15:13.346 --> 15:14.982
Give me one second, please.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.651
- Damn, that was a good sell.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.220
This is so crazy.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.289
It's obviously going to be
something for you.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.626
- Here it is.
This was it.

15:26.659 --> 15:30.163
- Okay, yeah,
that's probably not for you.

15:30.197 --> 15:34.567
*

15:34.601 --> 15:37.170
Okay, it's going to be okay.
We're gonna have a drink.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.172
We're gonna have ten drinks.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.573
Ugh, hey, do you know
the difference

15:40.607 --> 15:42.009
between a Manhattan
and a sidecar?

15:42.042 --> 15:43.276
I always forget.

whispering--

15:45.145 --> 15:46.679
- Hey!

Guess who found those
caramel Bugles at Kroger?

- Son of a bitch.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.648
Oh, honey.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.316
What can we do?

16:26.253 --> 16:28.088
- A sledgehammer.

16:32.192 --> 16:38.765
*

16:40.267 --> 16:42.435
You planning on stopping this?

16:45.138 --> 16:46.739
- Nah, I'm good.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.247
What is it?

16:54.281 --> 16:56.183
- Oh, my God.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.251
Does he have another ho?

17:06.393 --> 17:09.028
- If you're looking
for the vodka, I drank it.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.733
- What are you doing
in the dark?

17:13.766 --> 17:17.370
- Guess I'm used to it
after 20 years.

17:19.306 --> 17:23.076
- It means your child bride
wears very expensive underwear.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.281
What happened to us?

17:31.318 --> 17:33.786
- I was stupid.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.822
I was stupid and...

17:38.725 --> 17:40.293
- Doesn't even matter.

17:40.327 --> 17:43.163
Why do we have...

17:43.196 --> 17:45.832
Three mortgages
that we haven't paid?

17:45.865 --> 17:49.102
Why do our credit cards
all have advances on them

17:49.136 --> 17:53.806
and we have hardly anything
in our accounts?

17:53.840 --> 17:57.477
- I--look, I made a few bad
decisions at work.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.412
Oh, my God.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.181
- I tried to fix it with
a couple investments

18:01.214 --> 18:02.382
and I should have been...

18:02.415 --> 18:03.516
Yeah, I should have been
careful.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.851
I just--I panicked.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.254
- We have four children.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.890
- I know.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.260
- Are we going to lose
this house?

18:13.293 --> 18:15.328
- Look, I--I dropped the ball,
that's all.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.198
- Are we going to lose
the house?

18:18.231 --> 18:20.400
- No.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.335
I mean, I don't know.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.837
Maybe.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.807
We might.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.877
We could lose everything.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.315
I'm so sorry.

18:37.384 --> 18:40.353
- We're gonna rob that store.

about the store, Beth.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.406
- Well, I was.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.873
You need it just
as bad as we do.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.442
- We just do it once.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.844
And we get some money.
- Oh, dear God.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.613
- You get to help
your little girl.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.481

of this custody thing.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.450

away from us.

watch it in the big house.

- Go, go, go, go!
- Go, go, go, go!

21:14.774 --> 21:17.009
- Gotta go, gotta go!

21:17.043 --> 21:20.046
- There, out there!
They're going out the back!

21:20.079 --> 21:23.350
- * I feel like crying

21:23.383 --> 21:25.518
- Get them.

21:25.552 --> 21:27.954
Get them. Get them!

21:31.658 --> 21:33.660
- Beth.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.762
Hello?

21:35.795 --> 21:38.431
Are you okay in there?

21:38.465 --> 21:42.101
What's your name?
- I robbed a grocery store.

21:45.605 --> 21:49.442
- I robbed a grocery store.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.781
- We robbed a grocery store.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.750
- We totally did.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.619
- And we actually got away
with it.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.954
Like some smooth criminals.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.528
Please tell me we got the 30.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.397
- Uh...

22:10.430 --> 22:11.531
We got it.

22:11.564 --> 22:15.134
Thank you, God.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.104
- We got more than
the 30 grand.

22:20.507 --> 22:27.580
*

22:53.906 --> 22:54.073
.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.109
- Count it again.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.110
- I counted it right.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.178
- Count it again!

22:59.211 --> 23:00.413
- You said there would be 30.

23:00.447 --> 23:01.714
- I said 30 give or take.

23:01.748 --> 23:02.815
I guess it was give.

23:02.849 --> 23:03.983
- Why does a grocery store even

23:04.016 --> 23:05.017
have this kind of money
on hand?

23:05.051 --> 23:06.185
- Because it's hella shady.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.954
I told you this was a bad idea.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.188
- You guys are missing
the point.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.858
We just won half
a million dollars.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.661
- We didn't win anything.
- Half a mil, biatches!

23:14.694 --> 23:17.129
- We didn't win it!

23:17.163 --> 23:19.966
We stole it.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.869
And maybe the cops
don't follow up on $30,000.

23:22.902 --> 23:26.639
They damn sure follow up
on half a million dollars.

23:26.673 --> 23:29.809
- Nothing.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.011
We divide it up,
and we sit on it.

23:32.044 --> 23:35.815
Until we come up with a way
to get rid of it quietly.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.884
Without looking like,
you know--

23:37.917 --> 23:40.419
- Criminals.
- Yeah.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.993
Okay?

23:47.026 --> 23:48.194
- Yeah.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.065
Okay.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.737
Okay!

more features, more cylinders.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.114
and you get a laptop!

24:42.148 --> 24:43.816
- I don't get it.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.285
Yes, I can see that.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.287
- No, how you have money
for all of this.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.922
- Would you just let me worry
about that?

24:49.956 --> 24:51.223

some old people.

25:01.734 --> 25:05.838

25:05.872 --> 25:07.840
- Hey, Mrs. Boland.

25:07.874 --> 25:10.843
Nice weather we're having.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Boland.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.747
- I'm gonna have to call
you back.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.117
Oh, Mrs. Boland, hi.
What are you doing here?

25:18.150 --> 25:21.120
- I'm here to clean up a mess,
Amber.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.722
- You.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.256
Sit.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.993
Don't worry.
I mostly blame him.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.161
He should know better.
You're obviously stupid.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.863
Oh, it's not a knock.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.799
We all have our strengths
and weakness.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.834
You're a beautiful dummy.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.302
It doesn't make you
a bad person.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.870
So...

25:37.904 --> 25:39.271
Here's what's going to happen.

25:39.305 --> 25:42.141
You're going to quit
your job and my husband.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.110
Effective immediately.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.846
Trust me.
They're both a dead end.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.748
This is five grand.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.316
Enough for a plane ticket

25:50.349 --> 25:52.919
and a little to get
you started in LA.

25:56.856 --> 25:59.592
I do want to warn you
about something though.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.928
- Those folks out there,

26:01.961 --> 26:03.896
they take one look
at a person like you,

26:03.930 --> 26:06.966
the pretty, the dumb,
the self-hating,

26:06.999 --> 26:08.901
and they figure

26:08.935 --> 26:10.970
perfect for porn.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.342
- Mrs. Boland.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.611
Why are you doing this?

26:18.645 --> 26:22.381
- Because we both deserve more
than a liar in a pig suit.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.217
Me more than you, but still.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.888
- That's the nicest thing that
anyone has ever said to me.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.957
- Wow.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.826
Really?

26:33.860 --> 26:35.995
Wow.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.197
*

26:38.230 --> 26:40.633
- Uh, Boland.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.269
*

26:43.302 --> 26:44.937
- * The ladies, the ladies

26:47.073 --> 26:49.108
- * Girls with curls
and big long locks *

26:49.141 --> 26:50.376
* And beatnik chicks

26:52.411 --> 26:54.280
Whoo!

26:55.314 --> 26:57.950
Whoo!

26:57.984 --> 27:03.823
*

27:03.856 --> 27:05.191
- Oh, no.

27:12.699 --> 27:17.369
*

27:17.403 --> 27:20.139
- Doctor, I know you're busy,
and I won't waste your time.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.341
But I've been doing a lot
of research here

27:22.374 --> 27:25.044
on different drugs and things.

27:25.077 --> 27:28.981
Just, um, it has like this
crazy ass name.

27:29.015 --> 27:32.418
Um, but I know it's all
out of pocket--

27:34.220 --> 27:37.256
Um.
You're touching me.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.991
Why are you touching me?

27:39.025 --> 27:40.259
- Because you've been here
for ten minutes,

27:40.292 --> 27:42.061
and you've barely
taken a breath.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.465
The new med's a great option.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.901
Definitely worth trying before
we go down the transplant road.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.269
I've got some samples.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.904
We'll start her on it,
and see how she does.

27:51.938 --> 27:54.373
In the meantime, let's do a CT,

27:54.406 --> 27:57.176
creatinine clearance,
and an ultrasound.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.145
Cover all bases.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.149
- Mom.

28:03.182 --> 28:07.153
*

28:07.186 --> 28:09.021
- Can we get some water
in here please?

28:09.055 --> 28:11.257
- Yes, of course.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.293
Oh, my God, yes.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.441
- Annie Bananey.

28:29.475 --> 28:32.311
You forgot your paycheck.
A lot of money in here.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.113
- Thanks.
- Hey.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.448
How'd you have the balls
to do it?

28:36.482 --> 28:38.084
What, you and the girls
get all coked up

28:38.117 --> 28:41.253
or something beforehand?

28:41.287 --> 28:44.190
- I saw your ass tat.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.425
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.327
- How many chicks have
a tramp stamp

28:48.360 --> 28:51.330
that says
"All You Need Is Love"?

28:51.363 --> 28:54.266
- It's a very popular song.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.035
- Okay.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.772
Well, then, guess
you won't mind

28:59.806 --> 29:01.507
if I go to the cops then,
right?

29:01.540 --> 29:05.077
I mean, if it wasn't you I'm
sure you got some explanation

29:05.111 --> 29:09.381
for how you bought all this
on minimum wage.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.386
I didn't say nothing.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.091
Cops came around,
but I didn't tell 'em.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.329
You want money?

29:23.362 --> 29:26.165
- It's not like that.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.771
I'm gonna keep
my mouth shut.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.509
- Thanks.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.414
- I mean, I'm really gonna try.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.483
I am.

29:44.516 --> 29:47.386
I hope I can.

29:47.419 --> 29:50.356
I don't know.
I just get so lonely,

29:50.389 --> 29:53.292
and well...

29:53.325 --> 29:56.395
Sorry to be crass here,
but, uh...

29:56.428 --> 29:58.064
Horny.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.298
Too.

29:59.331 --> 30:01.167
I just want to shoot
my mouth off.

30:01.200 --> 30:06.405
Talk and talk until I'm...

30:12.979 --> 30:13.112
.

30:16.148 --> 30:20.086
*

30:20.119 --> 30:21.988
- Can we just get it over
with, okay?

30:22.021 --> 30:24.023
- All right, hey, hey.

30:24.056 --> 30:28.060
I'm not some wham, bam,
thank you ma'am.

30:28.094 --> 30:31.263
You know?
I need a little romance.

30:31.297 --> 30:38.537
*

30:46.913 --> 30:48.180
- Mom.

30:48.214 --> 30:51.117
- Hi, honey.
I thought you were asleep.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.519
And...here it is!

30:53.552 --> 30:55.187
Found it.

30:55.221 --> 30:58.024
He lost some change
in the couch so I was...

30:58.057 --> 30:59.358
just helping him find it.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.994
- Thanks, thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.596
Oh, Sadie, honey,
this is my, uh,

31:04.630 --> 31:08.968
Boomer.
I work with him at work.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.169
- Hi.
- You know, so,

31:10.202 --> 31:11.603
but he has to go now.

31:11.637 --> 31:14.273
Because he was--he has to--
- Uh...

31:14.306 --> 31:16.909
Use quarters on the
vending machines, I was gonna--

31:16.943 --> 31:20.246
and maybe fill a meter or two,
you know, surprise someone.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.614
- Hey, that's nice.
- Yeah, pay it forward.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.984
Or whatever.
Just go.

31:27.153 --> 31:29.555
- You know, uh...

31:29.588 --> 31:33.025
Since I have all this
bus fare now,

31:33.059 --> 31:35.027
I'll probably be back
real soon.

31:42.168 --> 31:43.902
- Morning.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.709
I'm gonna need the PINs
and passcodes to the accounts.

31:50.742 --> 31:55.147
Mortgage, bank, credit cards.

31:55.181 --> 31:56.415
- Uh...

31:56.448 --> 31:58.617
It's "2fast2furious."

31:58.650 --> 32:00.186
It's the number two.

32:00.219 --> 32:01.653
You know, like the movie.

32:01.687 --> 32:04.190
- I know it's a movie.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.392
That's for all of them?

32:06.425 --> 32:08.594
- Yeah.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.229
- I handled the mortgage.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.298
But how'd you do that?

32:12.331 --> 32:15.034
- I handled it
because you couldn't.

32:15.067 --> 32:18.337
And this thing that we do...

32:18.370 --> 32:21.407
Where you bring home the bacon,
and I don't ask any questions,

32:21.440 --> 32:23.742
that's--that's over.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.212
- Does that mean we get
to stay in the house?

32:26.245 --> 32:29.115
- It means I get to stay
in the house with the kids.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.183
You get to go to a motel.

32:31.217 --> 32:33.085
Your clothes are in the car.

32:36.022 --> 32:37.356
- Still no leads
on last week's

32:37.389 --> 32:39.458
armed robbery
of Fine and Frugal.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.360
A rep from the local police--

32:43.129 --> 32:44.763
- Our GoFundMe page
has been up for years.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.333
Some anonymous donor rolls
in now with all that cash?

32:47.366 --> 32:50.069
- It's a miracle.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.138
Why question it?

33:01.147 --> 33:03.182
See this?

33:03.215 --> 33:04.383
- I do.

33:09.288 --> 33:12.024
*

33:12.058 --> 33:14.393
- Our girl's coming back.
- Yeah.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.430
- Hey, oh--oh--
okay, bruiser.

33:18.464 --> 33:20.299
All right, ease up now.
You got him.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.334
- Ugh!
- Look at you.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.708
You need to go potty?

33:29.741 --> 33:31.243
Need to pee

33:31.277 --> 33:34.480
- Nah, he's good.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.348
- We already took him out.

33:39.118 --> 33:42.221
- Oh, relax, sweetheart.

33:42.254 --> 33:43.822
I just need you to call
your lady friends

33:43.855 --> 33:46.692
over so we can all have...

33:46.725 --> 33:48.160
A little talk.

33:49.495 --> 33:52.064
- Oh, about the money
you stole from us.

33:52.098 --> 33:53.499
*

33:56.068 --> 33:56.402
.

33:56.435 --> 33:57.035
- Yo, this backsplash is dope.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.806
What's that made out of,
marble?

34:00.839 --> 34:03.542
Yo, you ever get any problems
with staining back here?

34:03.575 --> 34:05.344
Like if you cookin' a big pot
of spaghetti sauce

34:05.377 --> 34:07.513
or something like that?

34:07.546 --> 34:09.415
- No, I don't think so.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.418
Hmm.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.653
- We didn't know you
owned the store.

34:18.457 --> 34:22.294
I look like some kind of
grocery store manager to you?

34:22.328 --> 34:25.331
What, like Rotary Club
or somethin'?

34:25.364 --> 34:27.566
Nah, let's just say that we got
certain "arrangements"

34:27.599 --> 34:29.701
with some local businesses.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.438
I mean, we help each other out
and what not, you know?

34:32.471 --> 34:34.873
- Like money laundering
for drugs?

34:34.906 --> 34:36.775
Told you it was shady.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.677
- Why don't you stop worrying
about my business dealings

34:38.710 --> 34:41.313
and start figuring how you
gonna pay me my money back.

34:41.347 --> 34:42.448
- We can get it back.

34:42.481 --> 34:43.849
- That'd be great.

34:43.882 --> 34:46.385
- Most of it.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.754
- Some of it for sure.

34:50.689 --> 34:53.359
Oh, what, like
you guys didn't spend a dime?

34:53.392 --> 34:54.726
- I don't know.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.496
I don't know, I probably
spent like--like 100.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.565
Grand.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.333
I'm gonna shoot you myself.

35:01.367 --> 35:05.437
- Nah, you just gonna pay me
back is all.

35:05.471 --> 35:08.740
And right quick too.
With interest.

35:15.514 --> 35:18.584
You know, you really got
to be careful, ladies.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.686
I mean, with citrus on marble,

35:20.719 --> 35:22.621
like lemon and whatnot,

35:22.654 --> 35:24.490
that stuff will erode
like crazy.

35:24.523 --> 35:27.926
*

35:29.761 --> 35:32.431
- Your Daddy
and I love you so much.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.899
And I know it's confusing.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.501
Daddy's got to stay here
while he and I work on

35:35.534 --> 35:36.802
some grown up stuff.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.370
You can have whatever
candy you want

35:38.404 --> 35:39.438
from the vending machines,
okay?

35:39.471 --> 35:40.706
all: Yay!

35:40.739 --> 35:42.208
- Hey.
- Pick the kids up from school

35:42.241 --> 35:43.642
and bring them straight
back here.

35:43.675 --> 35:44.710
Don't go to the park
or anywhere.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.412
- I can't have the kids here.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.646
I've got like one twin bed.
- You have to.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.416
You just have to.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.519
- I can't tell you.
- Wait, stop.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.554
Are you okay?

35:55.587 --> 35:57.823
Just take care of my babies.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.729
- Hey, who wants--
who wants pizza?

36:03.762 --> 36:05.731
- I do!
- Yay! Me! Me!

36:05.764 --> 36:08.667
*

36:08.700 --> 36:09.935
- I would have picked you up

36:09.968 --> 36:11.837
down the block,
but your cell was off.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.776
- I sold it.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.511
I had to.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.819
- And manual roll down
windows?

36:27.853 --> 36:30.689
Yas, queen.

36:30.722 --> 36:33.759
Mm-hmm, cloth interior.
Nice.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.427
Leather burns your ass.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.229
- How'd you get
to be so awesome?

36:37.263 --> 36:39.265
- I don't ride in Porsches.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.517
Who is it?

37:01.553 --> 37:03.689
I said, who is it?

37:04.756 --> 37:06.692
- Me.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.927
- Stan!

37:08.960 --> 37:10.896
What the hell are you doing?

37:10.929 --> 37:12.298
- I want an alarm system,

37:12.331 --> 37:14.032
and you--please fix
the back gate.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.968
- I said I would.
- Yeah, you said it.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.670
But it just sits there
wide open.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.606
- You got your bat out.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.007
You know you could have gotten
a knife out the drawer, baby.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.542
All right, all right.

37:23.575 --> 37:24.776
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- God.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.011
- Calm down.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37:26.044 --> 37:27.313
You scared?
Your hearts beating.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.881
Come here. Breathe.
Breathe.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.750
What'd I tell you?

37:31.783 --> 37:35.887
All this right here is all
the security you need, baby.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.889
- Hm.
- You don't need no Wiffle bat.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.725
- Yeah, that's so.

37:39.758 --> 37:44.496
Because your man here--hold on.

37:44.530 --> 37:45.964
Is no longer gonna
be trailing teenagers

37:45.997 --> 37:48.266
at the Great Steak N' Fry.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.037
- You applied to
the police academy?

37:52.070 --> 37:53.839
- I did.

37:53.872 --> 37:57.643
Yeah, I didn't tell you
in case I got rejected.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.978
Brother ain't get rejected.

38:03.682 --> 38:06.084
Aw, Detroit's finest, baby.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.787
Protect and serve.
Give me some.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.631
- Short.

38:19.665 --> 38:22.368
- Over 60 grand.

38:26.772 --> 38:27.906
- I took it back.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.708
Lost over half its value,
B-T-dubs.

38:29.741 --> 38:30.809
- Well, maybe you
shouldn't have

38:30.842 --> 38:32.043
bought it in the first place.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.679
- My, what a helpful
contribution.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.080
Let me just grab
my time machine.

38:35.113 --> 38:37.849
- Oh, my God, we should just
go to the police.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.553
- We haven't done anything
that bad yet.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.955
We don't have records.
- Uh, yes, now we do.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.724
- If we just explain
to them that--

38:45.757 --> 38:47.759
That we meant well?

38:47.793 --> 38:49.027
Gee, officer, we're sorry,

38:49.060 --> 38:50.829
we didn't mean to piss
off the gang.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.364
We just wanted to rob
the grocery store.

38:52.398 --> 38:54.900
- Okay, I'm just trying
not to die, okay?

38:54.933 --> 38:57.703
If you have a better plan--
- Actually, yes, I do.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.405
We should take it
from somewhere else.

38:59.438 --> 39:00.972
We'll just steal it,
and then we'll pay them back.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.774
And then we'll just put
the whole thing to bed.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.110
- Bitch, are you out
of your mind?

39:05.143 --> 39:06.144
- Enough!
- That's the best

39:06.177 --> 39:08.814
possible plan.
- Enough!

39:08.847 --> 39:10.416
Enough.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.953
We're gonna get that money.
We're gonna figure it out.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.989
Because we are strong
and we are resourceful.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.727
And we've accomplished way
harder than this.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.062
I once made 300 damn cupcakes
in one night,

39:24.095 --> 39:25.997
and they were both nut
and gluten free.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.833
- Kid still had
an allergy attack.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.802
- And you don't always have
to fact check me, okay?

39:33.772 --> 39:36.107
I'm gonna take a shower.

39:36.141 --> 39:39.077
I smell like booze and crime.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.151
- I'll call you tomorrow.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.787
*

39:53.825 --> 40:00.899
*

40:06.137 --> 40:08.006
Come on.

40:08.039 --> 40:09.875
I, uh--

40:09.908 --> 40:12.010
- Very.
- Hey.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.646
Come on.
Don't be rude.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.915
- Oh, God.
Boomer, you're wasted.

40:16.948 --> 40:20.051
- You know I was just thinking
about how we didn't finish...

40:20.085 --> 40:22.788
What we started.
- Boomer, it's not--stop.

40:22.821 --> 40:23.855
Stop.

40:23.889 --> 40:27.192
*

40:27.225 --> 40:28.727
Why don't we just have
a little bit

40:28.760 --> 40:30.929
of fun...
- Boomer, hey, hey, stop!

40:30.962 --> 40:32.464
My sister is here!

40:32.498 --> 40:34.099
Huh, is she hot?

40:38.269 --> 40:39.938
- I'll be fast, I promise.

40:49.715 --> 40:50.982
No!

40:52.117 --> 40:54.820
Ah, stop! No!

40:54.853 --> 40:56.488
You're hurting me!
- That's how you like it,

40:56.522 --> 40:57.956
right, tough girl?
- Stop, no!

40:57.989 --> 40:59.491
- Come on, you can rob
a store, right?

40:59.525 --> 41:00.692
- Get off of her!

41:00.726 --> 41:02.528
- Whoa.
Hey.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.029
Hey, hey. Easy.

41:04.062 --> 41:06.832
All right, no need
to get upset.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.834
All right?
No need to get upset.

41:08.867 --> 41:12.738
Why would I be upset?

41:12.771 --> 41:14.205
'Cause every man in the world

41:14.239 --> 41:16.241
thinks he can do whatever
he wants, whenever he wants.

41:16.274 --> 41:18.176
- Okay, okay, hey, we were just
having a little bit of fun.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.778
All right?

41:19.811 --> 41:21.713
'Cause you see...

41:21.747 --> 41:24.215
When a lady screams "stop"

41:24.249 --> 41:25.784
it is usually because she is

41:25.817 --> 41:28.119
not having the time
of her life.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.722
But what do I know?

41:30.756 --> 41:33.224
Now you're gonna pull
up your pants,

41:33.258 --> 41:36.862
and you are gonna get the hell
out of here.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.130
Get out!

41:47.238 --> 41:48.974
- No.

41:52.210 --> 41:54.880
- Yeah, it is.

41:54.913 --> 41:56.915
- No, it's not.

41:59.217 --> 42:01.119
- Okay, then.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.090
Shoot me.

42:13.298 --> 42:16.902
Stupid bitches.

42:16.935 --> 42:18.870
You're going down.
- Boomer.

42:18.904 --> 42:20.806
Boomer, please, please.
You need money, right?

42:20.839 --> 42:22.173
We can get you money.
- Oh, no, I'm turning you in.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.610
Boomer, please, please.
- You know how fast

42:24.643 --> 42:26.244
they're gonna lock you up?

42:26.277 --> 42:27.979
And take away your loser kid?
- No, Boomer. Please.

42:28.013 --> 42:29.781
- Yeah, your dumbass
sister too.

42:29.815 --> 42:33.051
The two of you are so done.
You're gonna rot in jail.

42:33.084 --> 42:36.622
You think you're so much better
than everyone.

42:36.655 --> 42:38.189
Well, now you are finished.

42:38.223 --> 42:39.991
It is over!
- No, please.

42:42.661 --> 42:44.162
Ow!
- Oh, my God.

42:44.195 --> 42:46.832
- God.
You've--

42:48.967 --> 42:50.301
- Oh.

42:51.970 --> 42:55.073
- Oh, my--oh, my--

42:55.106 --> 42:59.077
*

43:01.379 --> 43:03.381
He's not.

43:03.414 --> 43:06.351
- No.

43:09.254 --> 43:10.922
No.

43:10.956 --> 43:13.224
*

43:13.258 --> 43:15.360
What do we do now?

43:15.393 --> 43:17.095
*

43:17.128 --> 43:19.130
- Well, we're not going
to the police.

43:19.164 --> 43:22.868
*

43:25.904 --> 43:32.978
*
