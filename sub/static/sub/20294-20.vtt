SOMEBODY TAKE OFF

00:55.733 --> 00:57.600
THEY'RE RUNNING SOUTHBOUND
ON THE INTERSTATE RIGHT NOW.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.200
-HE MAY BE IN THE TRUCK YARD
RIGHT THERE AT FOREST.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.200

HAVE BEEN WHERE HE RAN.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.967

-WERE Y'ALL RIGHT BEHIND HIM?

01:22.067 --> 01:24.433
-I JUST GOT DOWN HERE.
I WENT RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

01:24.533 --> 01:25.967
THEY SAY HE RAN BACK HERE.

01:26.067 --> 01:27.567
SO, HE'S PROBABLY STILL
IN THE WOODLAND.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.167
-OKAY.

01:29.267 --> 01:31.333
-ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THIS FENCE, RIGHT?
-HE'S PROBABLY OVER THERE.

01:31.433 --> 01:33.300
-NO, NO, NO.
WHERE'S THE LAST PLACE
YOU SAW HIM?

01:33.400 --> 01:35.267
-I DIDN'T SEE HIM.
RODNEY SAW HIM ACROSS THERE.

01:35.367 --> 01:37.767
-BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE FENCE, NOT ON THIS SIDE.

01:37.867 --> 01:39.267

01:39.367 --> 01:40.967
HE'S OVER HERE IN THE BACK SIDE.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.333
-WHERE IS HE?

01:51.833 --> 01:53.100
WHERE IS HE?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.833
(glass breaking)

01:55.933 --> 01:58.900
-WINDOW'S OPEN,
WE'RE GONNA TASE HIM.

02:00.100 --> 02:03.867

02:16.533 --> 02:18.667
-STAY DOWN! STAY DOWN!

02:24.533 --> 02:25.867
WE'RE ALREADY GIVING
HIM A TRAFFIC.

02:31.167 --> 02:34.233
-HE HAD A COAT OVER HIS HEAD,
BUT I SAW HIS EYEBALLS
STICKING OUT.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.200
YOU GOT HIM?

02:38.233 --> 02:39.167
-THAT'S HIM.

02:39.267 --> 02:40.600
-WHY'D YOU RUN?

02:40.700 --> 02:42.067
-HMM?
-WHY'D YOU RUN?

02:42.167 --> 02:43.733
-HUH?
-WHY DID YOU RUN?

02:43.833 --> 02:47.433
-I RAN BECAUSE THEY STARTED
ATTACKING ME AND I DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.300
-IN THE CAR. PUT HIM
IN THE CAR.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.800
-LET'S WALK. COME ON.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.133
-SEARCH HIM GOOD.

02:52.233 --> 02:53.900
-I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ON ME.
-YEAH, OKAY.

02:54.067 --> 02:57.133
ALL THIS THAT YOU'VE STARTED...

02:57.233 --> 02:58.633
-I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ON ME.

02:58.733 --> 03:00.700
-OKAY, THAT'S FINE AND WELL,
BUT WE'RE STILL GONNA CHECK.

03:00.800 --> 03:01.933
-WHY DID YOU RUN, MAN?

03:02.067 --> 03:03.267
-HUH?
-WHY DID YOU RUN?

03:03.367 --> 03:04.467
-BECAUSE THEY STARTED
ATTACKING ME!

03:04.567 --> 03:05.967
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THEY STARTED ATTACKING YOU?

03:06.067 --> 03:08.467
-YEAH, HE'S GOT THEM
HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE.

03:08.567 --> 03:10.333
-SEE? THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.
THEY ATTACKED ME.

03:10.433 --> 03:11.733
-WHO ATTACKED YOU?

03:11.833 --> 03:13.167
-'CAUSE YOU WERE
RESISTING ARREST.
-THE TWO OFFICERS--

03:13.267 --> 03:14.600
NO, I DID NOT.
I DID NOT RUN

03:14.700 --> 03:15.933
AT FIRST.
-OH, YOU DIDN'T?

03:16.067 --> 03:17.500
-AT FIRST, NO.
I DID NOT RUN AT FIRST.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.700
-SO, THE OFFICERS
JUST PICKED YOU OUT
AND STARTED ATTACKING YOU?

03:19.800 --> 03:22.067
-HE THREW ME ON THE CAR
AND STARTED CHOKING ME.

03:22.167 --> 03:24.667
-YEAH, OKAY. YOU DO REALIZE
WE HAVE CAMERAS, RIGHT?

03:24.767 --> 03:26.133
-YES.
-OKAY. JUST MAKING SURE

03:26.233 --> 03:28.067
WE'RE CLEAR ON THAT.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.467
-JAEKWON, WHY DID YOU RUN?

03:30.567 --> 03:32.700
-I RAN BECAUSE WHEN I WAS
GETTING RESTRAINED,

03:32.800 --> 03:34.900
I WAS ASKING A QUESTION
AND I STARTED BEING CHOKED.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.167
-DO YOU KNOW WHY
THEY STOPPED YOU?

03:36.267 --> 03:37.933
-THEY STOPPED ME
'CAUSE THEY SAY
I WAS SPEEDING.

03:38.067 --> 03:39.500
-OKAY.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.233
AND WHY DID YOU--
SO, YOU RAN BECAUSE
THEY STARTED CHOKING YOU?

03:42.333 --> 03:43.967
-YES. THEY STARTED CHOKING ME

03:44.067 --> 03:45.467
AND I WAS ASKING WHY
THEY'RE CHOKING ME,

03:45.567 --> 03:47.900
LIKE, "WHY YOU TRYING
TO, LIKE, OVERLY RESTRAIN ME?"

03:48.067 --> 03:50.633
-WAS IT BECAUSE YOU WERE
TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THEM?
-I WAS NOT MOVING AT FIRST.

03:50.733 --> 03:52.333
-SO, YOU RAN ACROSS SIX--

03:52.433 --> 03:54.067
EIGHT LANES ON THE HIGHWAY...
-YES.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.733
-YOU JUMPED OVER,
YOU RAN THROUGH THE WOODS,

03:55.833 --> 03:57.133
-YES.
-JUMPED OVER A FENCE,

03:57.233 --> 03:58.433
YOU HID IN THIS TRUCK,

03:58.533 --> 03:59.867
DID YOU THINK
YOU WERE GOING TO GET AWAY?

04:00.067 --> 04:02.833
-I WASN'T-- I MEAN,
IT WASN'T THE POINT
OF GETTING AWAY.

04:02.933 --> 04:04.967
IT WAS THE POINT OF JUST
GETTING MY SAFETY FIRST.

04:05.067 --> 04:08.333
-OKAY, SO WHEN HE ASKED YOU
TO GET OUT OF THE CAR
UPON INITIAL TRAFFIC STOP,

04:08.433 --> 04:09.933
DID YOU RESIST TO GET OUT
OF THE CAR?
-NO...

04:10.067 --> 04:11.867
-ALL RIGHT, SO YOU STOOD
OUT THE CAR,

04:11.967 --> 04:13.900
AND HE JUST STARTED
CHOKING YOU FOR
NO APPARENT REASON?

04:14.067 --> 04:16.300
-NO, I GOT OUT THE CAR,
WHEN I GOT OUT THE CAR,

04:16.400 --> 04:18.400
HE ASKED ME TO COME
TO THE VEHICLE.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.533
THEN HE CAME UP BEHIND ME,
AND HE'S LIKE,
"YOU'RE BRING RESTRAINED."

04:21.633 --> 04:22.700
AND I WAS LIKE,
"WELL, WHAT FOR?"

04:22.800 --> 04:24.400
AND THAT'S WHEN I ASKED,
"WHAT FOR?"

04:24.500 --> 04:25.667
WHEN I ASKED WHAT FOR,

04:25.767 --> 04:28.067
THEY THREW ME ON THE CAR
AND STARTED CHOKING ME.

04:28.133 --> 04:30.067
-SO, YOU PULLED AWAY
FROM HIM TO ASK WHAT FOR?

04:30.167 --> 04:32.700
-NO, I DIDN'T REALLY
PULL AWAY FROM HIM.
I LOOKED BACK AT THEM.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.067
I NEVER PULLED AWAY
FROM THE OFFICER AT ALL

04:35.133 --> 04:36.533
UNTIL I STARTED BEING CHOKED.

04:36.633 --> 04:38.567
-ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE'RE GONNA
GO LOOK AT THE DASHCAM.
-OKAY.

04:41.633 --> 04:42.933
-LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

04:46.267 --> 04:48.400
PULL IT UP REAL QUICK.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.333
OKAY.

04:50.433 --> 04:53.800
SEE THE INITIAL TRAFFIC
STOP HERE.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.833
-HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
HIS OWN MIDDLE NAME.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.100
-OKAY, HE BEGINS TO RESIST,
NOT PUTTING HIS HANDS
BEHIND HIS BACK.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.233
-TURN AROUND!

05:05.600 --> 05:07.333
TURN AROUND!
-HE ACTUALLY ELBOWS YOU
RIGHT HERE.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.233
-TURN AROUND!
-WHY Y'ALL CHOKING ME?!

05:09.333 --> 05:11.133
-TURN AROUND
AND GIVE ME YOUR ARMS!

05:11.233 --> 05:13.400
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS!
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS!

05:13.500 --> 05:16.067
-WELL, I MEAN,
HE'S RESISTING THE WHOLE WAY.

05:16.133 --> 05:20.067
SO, THAT'S KIND OF STRANGE
THAT HE'S SAYING THAT YOU...
YOU GUYS ASSAULTED HIM.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.500
-GIVE ME YOUR HANDS! GIVE IT!

05:21.600 --> 05:23.500
GIVE IT-- YOUR HANDS!
-HOLD ON!

05:23.600 --> 05:25.733
-YOU'RE GONNA TASE ME, SIR?

05:25.833 --> 05:27.333
-GIVE ME YOUR HANDS, NOW!

05:31.600 --> 05:33.733
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS!

05:33.833 --> 05:35.433
-HE KICKED OFFICER BRODNIK.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.067
HE GETS TASERED AGAIN.

05:37.133 --> 05:39.567
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
NO POLICE BRUTALITY TO ME
RIGHT HERE.

05:39.667 --> 05:42.133
SO, THANK GOD THAT
WE HAVE THESE DASHCAMS.

05:42.233 --> 05:45.067
-BRODNIK, YOU THE ONE
THAT STOPPED HIM?
-YEAH.

05:45.167 --> 05:49.933
I WAS DOING SPEED ENFORCEMENT
NORTHBOUND ON I-75,

05:50.067 --> 05:53.567
AND I CHECKED THE SPEED
OF THIS VEHICLE TO BE MOVING
AT 96 MILES AN HOUR.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.067
IT'S 65 THROUGH HERE.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.767
SO, HE'S GOING PRETTY FAST.

05:57.867 --> 06:00.567
I GET UP THERE,
ASK FOR HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE,

06:00.667 --> 06:03.300
GIVES ME A PAPER LICENSE.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.933
LOOK AT THE PICTURE,
IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HIM.

06:06.067 --> 06:10.267
AT THAT POINT, I BECAME
CONVINCED THAT HE WAS NOT
THE PERSON ON THE I.D.

06:10.367 --> 06:13.133
AND AT THE SAME TIME,
MY PARTNER CAME TO
THE SAME EXACT CONCLUSION.

06:13.233 --> 06:15.067
TRIED TO GET HIM INTO CUSTODY,

06:15.133 --> 06:16.533
HE BEGAN TO PHYSICALLY RESIST.

06:16.633 --> 06:18.167
I ATTEMPTED TO TASE HIM TWICE,

06:18.267 --> 06:19.867
ALL THE DARTS WERE INEFFECTIVE.

06:19.967 --> 06:23.200
HE THEN WENT ACROSS
ALL THESE LANES OF TRAFFIC,
JUMPED THE MEDIAN WALL,

06:23.300 --> 06:26.067
WENT ACROSS THE OTHER
FIVE LANES, UP THE EMBANKMENT,

06:26.100 --> 06:27.467
AND INTO THE TRUCK YARD.

06:27.567 --> 06:29.367
-SO, HE'S GONNA GET CHARGED
WITH FELONY OBSTRUCTION

06:29.467 --> 06:32.533
ON TOP OF THE OTHER CHARGES
THAT WE GOT ON HIM
FOR TRAFFIC.

06:32.633 --> 06:36.067
AND HE'S GOT SEVERAL ISSUES
OUT OF FULTON COUNTY FOR
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WHATNOT.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.133
-OKAY.
-GOOD DEAL.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.100
-I BELIEVE STAYING PHYSICALLY
FIT HELPS OUT QUITE A BIT
IN THIS JOB.

06:43.200 --> 06:47.233
BECAUSE IT CAN GO FROM 0 TO 60,
YOU KNOW, IN JUST IN THE SNAP
OF A FINGER.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.900
YOU WANT TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE

06:49.067 --> 06:51.667
AND BE ABLE TO DO THE THINGS
THAT YOU NEED TO DO
RIGHT THEN AND THERE.

06:51.767 --> 06:55.267
I'M GONNA BE DOING A TRAFFIC
STOP ON THIS WHITE SUV
IN FRONT OF US.

06:55.367 --> 06:56.967
IT DOESN'T HAVE A REAR
LICENSE PLATE.

06:57.067 --> 07:00.167
AND IS ACTUALLY GOING
TO BE TAKING OFF FROM US.

07:00.267 --> 07:03.133
GONNA BE GOING NORTHBOUND
ON MACRUM APPROACHING
COLUMBIA WAY.

07:03.233 --> 07:05.767
IT'S A WHITE EXPEDITION,
NO REAR LICENSE PLATE

07:05.867 --> 07:08.267
IS WHAT WE GOT NOW,
BUT HE'S TAKING OFF.

07:08.367 --> 07:11.667
OH! HE JUST WENT THROUGH
THE STREET CLOSING SIGN.

07:11.767 --> 07:15.133
COLUMBIA WAY, NOW GOING
EASTBOUND ON COLUMBIA
FROM COLUMBIA WAY.

07:15.233 --> 07:17.533
(radio chatter)

07:17.633 --> 07:19.800
MY SPEED'S UP TO 80 NOW.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.267
HE'S GOT ABOUT
A THREE BLOCK HEAD START ON ME.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.167
SO, WE GOT SPIKES.

07:26.267 --> 07:27.733
WE GOT SOME SPIKES
ON THE VEHICLE.

07:27.833 --> 07:29.800
SOUNDS LIKE THEY GOT A GOOD
SPIKE ON IT.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.067
WE GOT A COUPLE OTHER VEHICLES
STILL TRYING TO CATCH UP
TO IT.

07:32.167 --> 07:35.800
-Person 1 on radio:
LET'S DO COLUMBIA
AND INTERSTATE PLACE.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.300
LET'S GET THAT LOCKED DOWN.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.333
-Person 2 on radio:
OKAY, COLUMBIA
AND INTERSTATE, LOCKED DOWN.

07:39.433 --> 07:40.967
-WE'RE GONNA STOP HERE.

07:42.433 --> 07:44.700
(train horn blows)

07:47.067 --> 07:49.133
GO AHEAD AND JUST
PARK RIGHT THERE.
NOBODY'S BACK THERE.

07:49.233 --> 07:50.933
HE'S SUPPOSEDLY IN HERE.

07:51.067 --> 07:53.100
BUT JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE,
IF THERE'S NO CAR RIGHT THERE,
JUST HANG TIGHT THERE.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.533
-ALL RIGHT.
-THANKS, GUYS.

07:54.633 --> 07:56.833
ALL RIGHT, SO WE GOT
A PERIMETER SET UP.

07:56.933 --> 07:59.167
534, ALL'S I GOT FOR
A DESCRIPTION ON THE DRIVER

07:59.267 --> 08:01.533
IS A WHITE MALE,
ABOUT MID 20'S, DARK HAIR.

08:01.633 --> 08:03.633
-IT'S ACTUALLY TWO PEOPLE.
IT'S A MALE AND A FEMALE.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.267
-COME HERE, MA'AM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:06.367 --> 08:08.067
DO YOU LIVE HERE?

08:08.100 --> 08:09.167
-NO.
-OKAY.

08:09.267 --> 08:11.267
-I WAS-- I WAS
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY.

08:11.367 --> 08:13.300
-COME HERE.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.467
534, DID ANYBODY SEE
THE FEMALE GET OUT?

08:15.567 --> 08:17.200
'CAUSE I JUST HAD A FEMALE
WALK OUT BEHIND A HOUSE

08:17.300 --> 08:19.067
AND SAYS SHE'S JUST
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.333
WERE YOU IN
THE WHITE EXPEDITION?
-Radio: I'D HOLD ONTO HER...

08:22.433 --> 08:23.867
-HAVE A SEAT.
-...BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING THAT

08:23.967 --> 08:27.100
WE GOT A WITNESS HERE WHO
THINKS HE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO I.D. HER.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.067
-534, I THINK THIS IS
GONNA BE HER.

08:30.167 --> 08:31.833
SHE'S BREATHING KINDA HEAVY.

08:31.933 --> 08:33.200
GO AND HAVE A SEAT.

08:33.300 --> 08:34.733
-(text message alert sounds)
-MA'AM, GET OFF YOUR PHONE.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.200
WHO'S DEKOA? HUH?

08:36.300 --> 08:37.833
-I ACCIDENTALLY CALLED HIM.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.633
-IS THAT THE GUY
IN THE WHITE EXPEDITION?
-Radio: IF YOU WANNA HUSTLE

08:39.733 --> 08:42.167
UP HERE AND TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS OTHER GUY THEY GOT
AND MAKE SURE HE'S YOUR GUY...

08:42.267 --> 08:45.300
-COPY THAT. LEWIS,
MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T LEAVE.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.533
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY JUST
WENT IN CUSTODY WITH
THE DRIVER HALF.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.267
-Person 1 on radio:
CODE FOUR,
YOU CAN HAVE THE AIR.

08:50.367 --> 08:51.933
-Person 2 on radio:
NOTHING. NO MORE OUTSTANDING.

08:52.067 --> 08:53.467
-THAT'S GONNA BE HIM.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.067
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

08:55.167 --> 08:58.667
UH, DO YOU JUST WANNA
TELL ME WHAT WAS GOING ON?

08:58.767 --> 09:00.867
-WELL, MY BROTHER
WAS DRIVING IT,

09:00.967 --> 09:03.733
AND I TOOK OFF OUT OF
THE CAR BECAUSE I KNEW
I HAD A WARRANT.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.233
-WHEN DID YOU TAKE OFF
OUT OF THE CAR?

09:05.333 --> 09:06.933
-AS SOON AS HE PULLED OVER.

09:07.067 --> 09:08.400
-WHERE AT?
-RIGHT OVER THERE.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.067
-OKAY. SO, YOU'RE SAYING
YOUR BROTHER WAS DRIVING?

09:11.133 --> 09:12.567
-YES, THERE WAS THREE
PEOPLE IN THE CAR.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.533
-THREE PEOPLE IN THE CAR.
AND WHAT WAS YOUR
BROTHER'S NAME?

09:14.633 --> 09:16.067
-I DON'T KNOW.

09:16.167 --> 09:17.700
-YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOUR BROTHER'S NAME IS?
-I KNOW HIS NAME,

09:17.800 --> 09:20.067
-BUT I'M JUST NOT GONNA SAY IT.
-YOU JUST DON'T WANNA TELL ME
WHAT IT IS?

09:20.167 --> 09:21.733
-I'M NOT A SNITCH,
SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY HIS NAME.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.800
-OKAY, WELL--
-PRETTY SURE YOU GUYS
PROBABLY FOUND HIM ALREADY.

09:23.900 --> 09:27.633
-OKAY. WHAT ABOUT THE ROAD
CLOSURE SIGN? YOU GUYS BLASTED
RIGHT THROUGH THAT.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.200
WHAT WERE YOU TELLING
YOUR BROTHER?

09:29.300 --> 09:31.767
-ALL I KNOW IS I (bleep) GRABBED
ON TO THE (bleep) BACK
AND I SQUEEZED.

09:31.867 --> 09:34.600
-OKAY. WHAT DID YOU TELL YOUR
BROTHER WHEN HE KEPT
DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.467
-TOLD HIM "STOP, STOP!"
YELLING "STOP" THE WHOLE TIME.

09:36.567 --> 09:37.933
-HE DIDN'T STOP THE WHOLE TIME?

09:38.067 --> 09:39.500
-YEAH, BECAUSE I WAS GONNA
HOP OUT AND RUN.
I'LL BE HONEST.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.200
-OKAY. GO AND HAVE
A SEAT FOR ME.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.800
-THESE DOUBLE LOCKED AND STUFF?
-YEAH.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.700
-YOU COOL WITH HAVING HIM
IN THE BACK OF YOUR CAR?
-YEAH.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.933
JUST LOOK AWAY FOR ME.

09:49.067 --> 09:50.400
GET YOU SEATBELTED IN HERE.

09:53.333 --> 09:54.433
ALL RIGHT, SIT TIGHT.

09:54.533 --> 09:55.800
-I APPRECIATE IT.
-YEAH, OF COURSE, MAN.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.500
-ALL RIGHT, MA'AM,
HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?

09:57.600 --> 09:59.900
-HE'S MY KIDS' DAD.
AND WE'RE NOT GETTING ALONG.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.967
-OKAY. SO THEN I GET BEHIND YOU
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE
A LICENSE PLATE ON HIS VEHICLE,

10:03.067 --> 10:04.133
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?

10:04.233 --> 10:05.700
-HE SAID THAT YOU WAS
GETTING THE CAR IN FRONT,

10:05.800 --> 10:07.167
-AND I WAS LIKE--
-HE WAS WHAT?

10:07.267 --> 10:09.333
-HE WAS-- THAT YOU WERE
GETTING THE CAR IN
THE FRONT OF US.

10:09.433 --> 10:12.700
AND I WAS LIKE, "STOP." I WAS
LIKE, "HE'S GETTING US."

10:12.800 --> 10:14.567
I WAS LIKE, "YOU NEED
TO STOP." AND HE WAS LIKE, "NO."

10:14.667 --> 10:16.400
AND HE JUST TOOK OFF.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.200
I WAS LIKE, "NO, YOU NEED
TO LET ME OUT."

10:18.300 --> 10:20.300
-AND WHAT WAS HE SAYING
WHEN YOU SAID HE NEEDED
TO LET YOU OUT?

10:20.400 --> 10:22.533
"SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP."
I WAS LIKE, "LET ME OUT."

10:22.633 --> 10:24.267
HE WAS LIKE, "NO,
YOU'RE NOT GETTING OUT
OF THE CAR."

10:24.367 --> 10:25.967
AND HE LOCKED THE DOOR.
-WHERE AT?

10:26.067 --> 10:28.000
-UH, RIGHT WHEN WE
HIT THE CORNER.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.967
-RIGHT AT, UH,
STILL IN ST. JOHNS?
-MM-HMM.

10:30.067 --> 10:32.100
-RIGHT THERE AT,
I BELIEVE IT WAS MACRUM?
-YEAH.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.667
-OH, 'CAUSE HE STARTED TO SLOW
DOWN IN FRONT OF
THE TRUCK, RIGHT?

10:35.767 --> 10:37.467
-YEAH.
-AND YOU BOTH GOT OUT,
AND HE LOCKED THE DOORS.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.167
-AND HE LOCKED THE DOORS
AND ROLLED UP THE WINDOWS.

10:39.267 --> 10:41.033
-OKAY.
-AND I WAS LIKE--

10:41.133 --> 10:43.667
-AND THIS WHOLE-- AND STILL
DURING THIS TIME IT'S JUST YOU
AND HIM DRIVING, RIGHT?

10:43.767 --> 10:46.033
-MM-HMM.
-YOU'RE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER
SEAT, HE'S DRIVING, RIGHT?

10:46.133 --> 10:47.500
-YEAH.
-OKAY. AND NOBODY ELSE
IN THE VEHICLE?

10:47.600 --> 10:48.833
-NO. JUST TWO.
-OKAY.

10:48.933 --> 10:50.167
-OKAY. THANK YOU, MA'AM.
-YUP.

10:51.167 --> 10:54.100
-ALL RIGHT, TYLER, RITA
TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE
THE ONE DRIVING.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.400
IT'S ONLY BEEN YOU AND HER
IN THE EXPEDITION ALL DAY.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.333
WHAT DO YOU GOT
TO SAY FOR THAT?
-NO COMMENT.

10:58.433 --> 11:01.333
I'M NOT GONNA GO AGAINST HER.
IF THAT'S WHAT SHE'S SAYING,
THEN THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID--

11:01.433 --> 11:03.067
-BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.067
-NO, BECAUSE THAT'S MY KIDS'
MOM. I'M NOT GONNA PUT HER
IN A SITUATION--

11:05.100 --> 11:07.067
-OKAY. WELL, SHE HAD NO PROBLEM
PUTTING YOU IN THAT SITUATION.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.900
-WELL, AT THE END OF
THE DAY, THEN,

11:09.067 --> 11:11.100
IF THAT'S HER BUSINESS,
WE'RE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.367
-WELL, THIS IS YOUR
CHANCE TO TALK,

11:12.467 --> 11:14.400
BECAUSE WE'RE BORDERLINE ON
A KIDNAP RIGHT NOW.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.767
SHE'S WANTING TO GET OUT
OF THE CAR, YOU'RE
TELLING HER NO.

11:16.867 --> 11:18.533
SHE'S THEN SCREAMING
AND CRYING WANTING TO GET OUT.

11:18.633 --> 11:19.700
-I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.433
-WELL, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HONEST
WITH ME YET,

11:21.533 --> 11:23.400
SO WHY WOULD I BELIEVE
YOU'RE GONNA BE HONEST
WITH ME NOW?

11:23.500 --> 11:25.733
-I'MMA BE HONEST WITH YOU.
-SO, ARE YOU REALLY GONNA
BE HONEST WITH ME?

11:25.833 --> 11:27.367
OR ARE YOU GONNA
CONTINUE TO LIE?

11:27.467 --> 11:29.533
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T TOLD
A SINGLE TRUE STORY SINCE
WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE.

11:29.633 --> 11:31.167
SO, ARE YOU GONNA
TELL ME THE TRUTH?
-YES.

11:31.267 --> 11:32.533
THE TRUE STORY IS, IS--

11:32.633 --> 11:34.067
-OKAY, THEN BE HONEST
WITH ME AND TELL ME
THE TRUTH.

11:34.133 --> 11:35.800
'CAUSE IF YOU START TO LIE,
I'M GONNA SHUT THIS DOOR,

11:35.900 --> 11:37.933
AND THIS CONVERSATION'S OVER
WITH. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

11:38.067 --> 11:39.233
-YUP.
-OKAY.

11:39.333 --> 11:42.300
-TRUTH IS IS YEAH,
I WAS DRIVING. OKAY?
-OKAY.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.200
-OKAY, SHE WAS SAYING
"STOP, STOP."

11:46.300 --> 11:49.933
BUT I DID NOT LOCK DOORS,
I DID NOT PUSH HER BEHIND
OR WHATSOEVER.

11:50.067 --> 11:51.467
AND, UH...

11:51.567 --> 11:53.067
YOU KNOW, AND, UM,

11:53.167 --> 11:55.767
MAYBE SHE WAS SCARED TOO,
BECAUSE OUR KIDS ARE IN D.H.S.

11:55.867 --> 11:58.800
-OKAY.
-SO, THAT'S WHY SHE PROBABLY,
YOU KNOW, DID WHAT SHE DID.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.600
AND HONESTLY, THE ONLY REASON
I RAN IS BECAUSE I HAVE
A WARRANT.

12:01.700 --> 12:03.367
I DON'T WANNA GO TO JAIL.
-OKAY.

12:03.467 --> 12:06.400
SO, YOU GOT THE FELONY WARRANT,
YOUR PAROLE VIOLATION
FOR ROBBERY,

12:06.500 --> 12:08.533
THE ELUDE, OBVIOUSLY,
'CAUSE YOU TOOK OFF IN THE CAR,

12:08.633 --> 12:10.867
CRIMINAL MISCHIEF 1
FOR TEARING UP THE ODOT SIGNS,

12:10.967 --> 12:12.600
RECKLESS DRIVING,
AND THEN RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT

12:12.700 --> 12:13.967
BECAUSE SHE WAS
IN THE VEHICLE WITH YOU.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.733
-YEAH.
-BUT I GOTTA TALK TO
MY SERGEANTS

12:15.833 --> 12:18.167
AND SOME OTHER OFFICERS.
-IS THERE ANY WAY I COULD
TALK TO HER BY ANY CHANCE?

12:18.267 --> 12:19.933
-WE HAVE TO--
WE'LL WAIT ON THAT
AND WE'LL SEE.

12:20.067 --> 12:21.067
ALL RIGHT?
-OKAY, THANK YOU.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.167
-ALL RIGHT, HANG TIGHT.

12:23.267 --> 12:24.733
ALL RIGHT, MA'AM.

12:24.833 --> 12:26.567
-YOU DON'T WANNA TALK TO HIM?
-NO.

12:26.667 --> 12:27.900
NO.

12:28.067 --> 12:30.400
-I'M SORRY.
-NO!

12:30.500 --> 12:32.867
-RITA, PLEASE.
-NO.

12:32.967 --> 12:36.400
-STEPHANIE HAS MY MONEY.
I'M GONNA-- GO COLLECT IT.
500 BUCKS.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.933
(crying)

12:38.067 --> 12:40.167
-I DON'T WANT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.900
-PLEASE, TAKE CARE OF
MY KIDS. I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

12:45.167 --> 12:46.733
I LOVE YOU, I'M SORRY.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.467
I DIDN'T MEAN TO, RITA.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.067
I SAID THE TRUTH.

12:50.133 --> 12:52.267
-ALL RIGHT, PARTNER, SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
CAN YOU BLAME HER?

12:52.367 --> 12:53.767
-NO, I CAN'T.
-ALL RIGHT.

12:56.167 --> 12:59.167
-MOST PEOPLE COME TO BOISE
FOR THE CLEAN ATMOSPHERE.

12:59.267 --> 13:01.600
IT'S NESTLED RIGHT
IN THE FOOTHILLS.

13:01.700 --> 13:05.067
THERE'S WATER-SKIING WITHIN
A FEW MINUTES OF BOISE,

13:05.100 --> 13:07.500
THERE'S SNOW-SKIING
WITHIN A HALF HOUR,

13:07.600 --> 13:11.067
THERE'S FISHING AND HUNTING,
RIDING FOUR-WHEELERS,
MOTORCYCLES,

13:11.100 --> 13:14.533
THERE'S ENDLESS TRAILS
FOR MOUNTAIN BIKING...

13:14.633 --> 13:16.533
(radio chatter)

13:16.633 --> 13:20.867
WE ARE RESPONDING RIGHT NOW
TO ASSIST AN OFFICER WHO'S
ON SCENE WITH A FIGHT

13:20.967 --> 13:24.333
AND HAS PROBABLY ONE
MALE DETAINED.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.333
IS HE THE ONE HERE?
-YEAH, IT'S THE FANCY GUY
THAT WAS PARKED RIGHT THERE.

13:31.433 --> 13:32.833
THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN
GETTING INTO IT.

13:32.933 --> 13:35.233
HE WAS ALSO POINTED OUT,
BUT I COULDN'T TALK
TO TWO PEOPLE AT ONCE.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.567
-OKAY. LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.367
-SO, I'M JUST EXPLAINING THIS--

13:39.467 --> 13:41.067
-YOU DON'T HAVE PERMISSION
TO SEARCH MY VEHICLE.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.133
-HEY, I'M NOT SEARCHING THE CAR.
STEP BACK. STEP BACK.

13:43.233 --> 13:45.400
I'M NOT SEARCHING IT,
I'M LOOKING IN IT.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.133
-OKAY.
-AND DON'T TRY TO TELL ME
WHAT I NEED TO DO.

13:48.233 --> 13:50.200
-OKAY.
-STAY RIGHT THERE
AND DON'T GET UP.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.667
23-17, IS THERE A K9 AVAILABLE?

13:52.767 --> 13:54.433
-IS THERE SOMETHING
IN THE CAR WE NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT?

13:54.533 --> 13:57.367
-NO, THERE'S NOTHING,
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE PERMISSION
TO SEARCH MY VEHICLE.

13:57.467 --> 14:00.633
BUT I AM ON PROBATION,
IT'S TRUE.

14:00.733 --> 14:03.433
-OKAY, HOW 'BOUT THIS,
I'M GONNA START GETTING
ALL YOUR INFO, OKAY?

14:03.533 --> 14:04.867
-ALL RIGHT.

14:04.967 --> 14:06.333
I DID SEE A FIGHT,

14:06.433 --> 14:08.067
BUT IT WAS NOT ME
THAT WAS IN IT.

14:08.133 --> 14:09.767
I DID NOT ASSAULT ANYBODY.
-OKAY.

14:09.867 --> 14:12.967
-I WAS NOT DRINKING ANY
SUBSTANCE-- ANY ALCOHOL.

14:13.067 --> 14:15.333
-OKAY.
-I'M NOT DRINKING,
YOU CAN BREATHALYZE ME.

14:15.433 --> 14:17.067
-OKAY.
-I'M-- I AM CLEAN.

14:17.133 --> 14:19.067
I AM ON PROBATION,
AND I DON'T WANNA
GET IN TROUBLE.

14:19.167 --> 14:21.133
-IF YOU HAD BEEN STRAIGHT UP
WITH ME RIGHT FROM
THE BEGINNING,

14:21.233 --> 14:23.700
BEEN LIKE, "OH, YEAH,
I SAW A FIGHT AND THERE WAS
THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER,"

14:23.800 --> 14:25.367
THAT WOULD HAVE GONE
A LOT BETTER, RIGHT?
-OKAY.

14:25.467 --> 14:27.100
-RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.200
-I'M JUST BEING STRAIGHT
WITH YOU, MAN, YOU'RE
ACTING WEIRD.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.067
I'M COMING UP TO YOU,
I'M TRYING TO TALK TO YOU,

14:31.133 --> 14:33.433
YOU'RE TELLING ME, TELLING US
YOU DON'T WANT US LOOKING
IN YOUR CAR.

14:33.533 --> 14:35.400
SO, WE'RE IN A LITTLE
BIT OF A PICKLE HERE.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.667
HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?

14:36.767 --> 14:38.633
-WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR CAR?

14:38.733 --> 14:40.400
-THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON,
I'M SORRY.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.733
-I'M JUST--
I'M VERY TOUCHATIVE--
TOUCHY TO POLICE.

14:42.833 --> 14:45.367
I THINK YOU GUYS SHOW
VERY LITTLE RESTRAINT

14:45.467 --> 14:48.067
AND I DON'T TRUST YOU,
I'M SORRY.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.300
-TOO LITTLE RESTRAINT HOW?

14:49.400 --> 14:50.633
-THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH.

14:50.733 --> 14:52.500
-WHAT HAVE I DONE
TO PROVE TO YOU--
-BECAUSE, I MEAN--

14:52.600 --> 14:55.500
-THAT I'M SHOWING NO RESTRAINT.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
THAT STATEMENT MEANS.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.433
-I THINK THE POLICE
ROUTINELY USE EXCESSIVE FORCE.

14:58.533 --> 15:01.200
YOU'VE GOT GUNS ON YOU.
YOU INTEND ON SHOOTING PEOPLE?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.067
-OF COURSE I HAVE GUNS,
I'M A POLICE OFFICER.

15:03.167 --> 15:05.700
-THAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU
DO IS THEY-- I'M GONNA
SHOOT PEOPLE.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.200
AND IT'S CONSTANTLY ABOUT FORCE.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.533
-WHERE DID YOU
COME UP WITH THAT?

15:08.633 --> 15:09.700
-WHERE DID I COME UP
WITH THAT?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.500
-DID I COME HERE
AND PULL MY GUN ON YOU?

15:11.600 --> 15:14.800
-NO, BUT AS SOON AS I GO,
YOU KNOW, "SIR, YOU DON'T HAVE
PERMISSION TO SEARCH,"

15:14.900 --> 15:16.700
"SIT DOWN! I'M DOING MY JOB!

15:16.800 --> 15:18.667
GET OUT OF THE (bleep) WAY,
YOU IGNORANT--" I'M SAYING--

15:18.767 --> 15:21.067
-BECAUSE ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS RELAX.

15:21.100 --> 15:24.600
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET THIS
PARANOIA THAT WE'RE GONNA COME
HERE AND USE WEAPONS ON YOU.

15:24.700 --> 15:28.933
THAT'S RIDICULOUS. IF YOU DID
NOTHING WRONG, JUST BE CHILL.

15:29.067 --> 15:31.433
WHAT WAS THE CONCERN
WHEN I WALKED OVER TO THE DOOR?

15:31.533 --> 15:32.767
-I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
-YOU FREAKED OUT.

15:32.867 --> 15:34.933
-NO, YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO GAIN MY CONFIDENCE

15:35.067 --> 15:37.500
TO CON ME INTO GIVING
UP SOMETHING,

15:37.600 --> 15:40.167
BUT I'VE GOT NOTHING
TO GIVE UP!
-OKAY.

15:40.267 --> 15:42.967
-SIR, I-- HOW ABOUT THIS,

15:43.067 --> 15:45.933
CAN I PLEASE GIVE YOU THE NAMES
OF THE PERPETRATORS THAT
I SAW DO IT?

15:47.433 --> 15:49.367
-DID YOU SEE SOMEBODY GET HURT?

15:49.467 --> 15:50.767
DID YOU SEE
SOMEBODY GET PUNCHED?

15:50.867 --> 15:51.967
-I DID SEE SOMEBODY GET PUNCHED.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.300
I KNOW THESE--
THEY'RE CO-WORKERS.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.967
-SO NOW IT MAKES
A LITTLE MORE SENSE.

15:57.067 --> 15:59.067
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT
UP IN THE WHOLE THING,

15:59.133 --> 16:00.833
YOU KNOW THESE,
THESE ARE FRIENDS
OF YOURS.

16:00.933 --> 16:02.900
-I DON'T WANT TO GET
INVOLVED IN THIS WITH THEM.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.767
-ALL RIGHT. SO, I'M GONNA
ASK YOU THE QUESTION

16:04.867 --> 16:06.500
BECAUSE THERE IS
A DRUG DOG COMING HERE,

16:06.600 --> 16:08.433
AND THE DOG'LL
RUN AROUND THIS CAR.

16:08.533 --> 16:11.400
IF THE DOG ALERTS,
THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.833
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE
AN ISSUE, RIGHT?
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN?

16:13.933 --> 16:15.067
-NO, SIR.
-OKAY.

16:15.133 --> 16:17.433
IF THE DOG DOESN'T ALERT,
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.433
IT'LL BE THAT SIMPLE.

16:19.533 --> 16:21.133
OKAY?

16:24.133 --> 16:26.433
(dog barking)

16:26.533 --> 16:28.067
NATHAN...

16:28.167 --> 16:31.533
THE DOG ALERTED, THAT GIVES
US PROBABLY CAUSE TO GET IN
THAT CAR.

16:31.633 --> 16:32.900
JUST TELL ME, MAN.

16:33.067 --> 16:35.067
IS IT SOMETHING SMALL?
A LITTLE WEED?

16:35.167 --> 16:37.700
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
JUST TALK TO ME.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.567
-I DON'T WANNA
INCRIMINATE MYSELF.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.767
-OKAY, SO YOU'RE TELLING ME,
JUST BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING IS

16:41.867 --> 16:44.100
THERE'S EITHER A PIPE IN THERE,
OR THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF MARIJUANA.

16:44.200 --> 16:47.333
OKAY, IF YOU TELL ME RIGHT NOW,
AND IT'S JUST SOME PERSONAL USE,

16:47.433 --> 16:49.100
HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO
WITH IT.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.633
WE WON'T TAKE YOU
TO JAIL.

16:50.733 --> 16:54.100
IF YOU TELL ME STRAIGHT UP
WHAT IT IS,

16:54.200 --> 16:55.900
THEN WE'LL JUST DEAL WITH THAT.

16:56.067 --> 16:57.667
WHICH MIGHT MEAN A TICKET.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.867
-THERE IS A PIPE IN THERE.

17:01.967 --> 17:03.400
-IS THAT IT?

17:03.500 --> 17:04.833
-THAT'S IT.
-WHERE'S IT GONNA BE?

17:04.933 --> 17:06.467
-IT'S IN MY TRUNK.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.067
-IN THE VERY BACK?
-THAT'S RIGHT.

17:08.167 --> 17:10.200
-ALL RIGHT.
-YOU GUYS ARE REAL JERKS.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.667
-I'M NOT CONCERNED THAT
YOU LIKE ME OR NOT, NATHAN,

17:12.767 --> 17:14.500
I'M STILL BEING FAIR TO YOU.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.833
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS SAY,
"HEY, YEAH, I SAW A FIGHT,
THESE GUYS WERE DOING THIS."

17:16.933 --> 17:18.867
SHE WOULD'VE ASKED YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS
AND PROBABLY LEFT.

17:18.967 --> 17:20.667
YOU WENT INTO PANIC MODE.

17:20.767 --> 17:25.567
-JUST GOING THROUGH THE
OTHER CONTAINERS IN THE VEHICLE.

17:27.567 --> 17:30.800
LITTLE BIT OF MARIJUANA.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.800
PARAPHERNALIA, SOME PIPES.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.800
-HEY, NATHAN?

17:36.900 --> 17:39.200
OKAY, SO THIS IS THE PELICAN
CASE YOU WERE TELLING
ME ABOUT.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.633
-THAT'S CORRECT.
-OKAY.

17:40.733 --> 17:42.433
-WHAT DO YOU GOT TO SAY
ABOUT THAT?

17:42.533 --> 17:45.233
-THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE
THAT GETS USED ON
A REGULAR BASIS

17:45.333 --> 17:47.800
TO ME THAN JUST
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN,
IS THAT RIGHT?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.633
-UM, ON WEEKENDS.

17:49.733 --> 17:51.433
-SO, IT'S A PARTY KIT.

17:51.533 --> 17:52.767
-SORT OF.
-OKAY.

17:53.833 --> 17:55.367
-SHOULD I JUST CARRY IT
AROUND IN A BAG INSTEAD?

17:55.467 --> 17:57.733
-NO, A PARTY IN A BOX
RIGHT THERE.

17:57.833 --> 17:59.067
I LIKE IT.

17:59.133 --> 18:01.067
BUT I DON'T LIKE IT.

18:01.100 --> 18:02.900
I LIKE THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE ORGANIZED.

18:03.067 --> 18:05.700
-I THINK YOU WOULD
APPRECIATE THE TACTICAL
PELICAN CASE, BUT...

18:05.800 --> 18:07.700
-(chuckles)
I DO LIKE THAT.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.067
-YOU KNOW, I WAS RAISED
A REDNECK, TOO, YOU KNOW.

18:10.133 --> 18:13.800
I AIN'T JUST A TOTAL
PUSSY LIBERAL FROM OREGON.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.533
YOU KNOW, I GOT
A .30-06, AND I'M--

18:16.633 --> 18:18.100
YOU KNOW, A MAN!

18:18.200 --> 18:20.067
I'M A FREE AMERICAN!

18:20.100 --> 18:24.867
AND YOU'RE ARRESTING ME
FOR DOING SOMETHING THAT
THE FOUNDING FATHERS USED TO DO.

18:24.967 --> 18:27.067
-THIS IS WRONG.
-FOUNDING FATHERS
WERE SMOKING WEED?

18:27.133 --> 18:28.600
-THEY WERE GROWING WEED.

18:28.700 --> 18:32.633
AND THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE
THAT THOMAS JEFFERSON DID
USE WEED AS WELL.

18:32.733 --> 18:35.200
BUT, I MEAN,

18:35.300 --> 18:40.333
THE FACT IS YOU'RE TAKING
SOMETHING THAT'S IN THERE

18:40.433 --> 18:42.567
THAT DOESN'T HURT ANYBODY.

18:42.667 --> 18:45.933
I MEAN, HOW IS THIS
NOT TOTALITARIANISM?

18:46.067 --> 18:47.067
YOU KNOW?

18:47.133 --> 18:48.933
-NATHAN...

18:49.067 --> 18:51.133
IS MARIJUANA LEGAL IN IDAHO?

18:51.233 --> 18:52.567
-NO, IT'S NOT.
IT SHOULD BE.
-OKAY.

18:52.667 --> 18:55.067
AM I UPHOLDING THE LAW
BY TAKING THAT AWAY FROM YOU?

18:55.133 --> 18:56.967
-YOU'RE UPHOLDING
AN INJUST LAW.

18:57.067 --> 18:58.567
-OKAY.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.467
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE BEING
COOL WITH YOU. WE'RE GONNA
GIVE YOU A TICKET

19:00.567 --> 19:02.067
AND YOU GET TO GO FREE TONIGHT.

19:02.167 --> 19:04.267
BUT ALL THAT STUFF
YOU HAVE RIGHT THERE

19:04.367 --> 19:08.133
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO ADDRESS
WITH YOUR PROBATION OFFICER.

19:08.233 --> 19:09.733
WORK IT OUT THERE.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.500
-HOW IS THAT RIGHT? SO I HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF FUN ON
THE WEEKENDS,

19:12.600 --> 19:14.600
AND IT STAYS WITH ME FOREVER?

19:14.700 --> 19:16.167
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

19:16.267 --> 19:18.267
-THEN DON'T HAVE FUN
ON THE WEEKENDS.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.567
STICK WITH JUST ALCOHOL.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.867
-GO AHEAD AND STAND UP.
-SO, WHAT? I CAN BEAT OTHER
PEOPLE UP?

19:22.967 --> 19:24.933
'CAUSE ALCOHOL IS TERRIBLE!
-WHOA.

19:25.067 --> 19:28.567
-I HOPE ONE DAY I CAN DO
WHAT I WANT TO DO
IN MY FREE TIME

19:28.667 --> 19:30.800
AND BE WITHIN THE LAW TOO,

19:30.900 --> 19:32.400
AND THEN WE CAN GET ALONG.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.567
-YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.067
YOU'RE JUST IN THE WRONG STATE.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.500
-I KNOW I AM.
I'M TRYING SO HARD TO GET OUT.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.900
-IF YOU WANNA SMOKE WEED,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO MOVE
TO A STATE WHERE IT'S LEGAL.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.067
-I'M TRYING.

19:43.133 --> 19:45.267
-AND THAT'S A DECISION
THAT IDAHO HAS MADE,

19:45.367 --> 19:46.567
TO STAND FIRM ON THAT.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.067
-WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT, OKAY?
-ALL RIGHT.

19:50.433 --> 19:51.467
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.133
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.900
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:55.067 --> 19:55.933
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:56.067 --> 19:59.067
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.700 --> 20:06.633
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:06.733 --> 20:08.267
-(theme music playing)
