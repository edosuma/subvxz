00:00.202 --> 00:02.960
So, you know, I read this
really interesting article

00:02.963 --> 00:07.109
about a man whose dog dragged
him out of a flaming gym.

00:07.112 --> 00:09.899
Matthew, I love you, but
we're not getting a dog.

00:09.902 --> 00:11.568
Okay? We couldn't even
keep a Roomba alive.

00:11.571 --> 00:13.037
We shouldn't have given it that beer.

00:13.039 --> 00:14.357
It was funny, though.

00:14.359 --> 00:16.392
Hi, welcome to Champions.

00:16.395 --> 00:18.128
You give us a mere 15 years,

00:18.130 --> 00:19.896
we'll give you the
body you always wanted.

00:19.898 --> 00:21.429
I'm looking for a Vincent Cook.

00:21.432 --> 00:22.414
You're looking at him.

00:22.417 --> 00:24.033
Whoops! Now you're looking at me.

00:24.036 --> 00:25.435
I'm his brother, Matthew, okay?

00:25.437 --> 00:27.645
That's Vince, the guy
you were just looking at!

00:27.648 --> 00:29.539
- He knows.
- You slept with my wife.

00:29.541 --> 00:30.573
And now you're gonna pay.

00:30.575 --> 00:31.523
- Whoa!
- Oh my God!

00:31.526 --> 00:33.309
Please don't kill him, just
shoot him in the shoulder

00:33.311 --> 00:35.011
if you have to, or
better yet, the penis!

00:35.013 --> 00:37.614
Or not! Okay? Hey, sir, listen, please.

00:37.616 --> 00:40.550
I'm sure there's been some
kind of mistake, right, okay?

00:40.552 --> 00:41.982
Uh, what... what's your wife's name?

00:41.984 --> 00:43.520
- Debra Kemp.
- Okay.

00:43.522 --> 00:46.022
So there hasn't been a mistake.

00:46.024 --> 00:47.223
Do you have any final wishes?

00:47.225 --> 00:48.007
Please don't shoot him.

00:48.009 --> 00:49.676
He's got so little to live for already.

00:49.679 --> 00:50.734
What?

00:50.737 --> 00:52.803
I mean, he's had so many tough breaks.

00:52.806 --> 00:55.031
He was the star baseball
player of our high school team.

00:55.033 --> 00:56.234
Full ride to college,

00:56.237 --> 00:58.067
and he lost it all
through bad decisions.

00:58.070 --> 01:00.136
Okay, there were some things
that were out of my control.

01:00.138 --> 01:02.972
The economy was in the pits, also Iraq,

01:02.974 --> 01:05.542
and then, yeah, some alcohol,
some weed, but like...

01:05.544 --> 01:07.077
Wait, you were an athlete?

01:07.079 --> 01:09.279
How? I mean, your
brother on the other hand,

01:09.281 --> 01:10.780
I mean, his body's smoking.

01:10.782 --> 01:12.749
I mean, I'd get it if
my wife slept with him.

01:12.751 --> 01:13.949
Thank you.

01:13.952 --> 01:16.039
- That was so nice.
- What is happening right now?

01:16.042 --> 01:18.247
But what is the point
of killing this guy, huh?

01:18.250 --> 01:21.024
Broken dreams, deteriorating body,

01:21.026 --> 01:22.592
no dog.

01:22.594 --> 01:25.622
In a lot of ways, keeping
him alive is worse punishment,

01:25.625 --> 01:26.796
don't you agree?

01:26.798 --> 01:29.833
Scientifically, we're
all deteriorating, right?

01:29.835 --> 01:34.204
But yes, there's some
truth to what he's saying.

01:34.206 --> 01:36.739
Huh. I mean, I guess,
if you put it that way,

01:36.741 --> 01:39.542
my cheating wife and incurable
dandruff aren't really anything

01:39.544 --> 01:41.511
- compared to your whole deal.
- Exactly!

01:41.513 --> 01:42.976
Well, I'm gonna head out.

01:42.979 --> 01:45.148
I got five other guys I
gotta confront this morning.

01:45.150 --> 01:46.182
- Five.
- Yeah.

01:46.184 --> 01:49.486
Okay, good luck with that.

01:49.488 --> 01:51.871
You know what would've
protected us in that situation?

01:51.874 --> 01:53.034
We're not getting a dog.

01:53.037 --> 01:54.169

02:02.554 --> 02:05.902
Finally, I can just
let go and disappear.

No, no, no, I'm not... I'm not
disappearing like that, okay?

02:14.112 --> 02:16.012
Yeah, I've just led a life
of letting people down,

02:16.014 --> 02:17.815
and need a change of scenery, you know?

02:17.818 --> 02:19.082
No, I do not.

02:19.084 --> 02:21.631
Wow, I picked the wrong
person to confide in.

02:21.634 --> 02:24.020
I usually confide in my wife and son.

02:24.022 --> 02:27.090
Do you have anything like that?

02:27.092 --> 02:29.058
Can I just say what an
honor it is to be here

02:29.060 --> 02:31.597
at the Manhattan Academy
for the Performing Arts?

02:31.600 --> 02:34.497
I have dreamt of this moment
ever since my humble beginnings

02:34.499 --> 02:36.332
in the horrible town I was raised in.

02:36.334 --> 02:38.468
It's not that bad. It's Cleveland.

02:38.470 --> 02:40.737
LeBron James, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,

02:40.739 --> 02:43.072
very vibrant Polish
music scene, actually.

02:43.074 --> 02:44.374
No, I wasn't criticizing.

02:44.376 --> 02:45.742
You know, you did the best you could

02:45.744 --> 02:47.310
with your limited resources.

02:47.312 --> 02:48.803
She's a single mom.

02:48.806 --> 02:51.614
Mm-kay, there is a
tragic overtone to this

02:51.616 --> 02:53.550
that I just want to
refute. He has a nice life.

02:53.552 --> 02:54.784
We have a panini press.

02:54.786 --> 02:56.352
- She's my rock.
- Okay.

02:56.354 --> 02:59.122
All I'd asked was "Did you
find the building okay?"

02:59.124 --> 03:02.192
Anyway, I unfortunately
have terrible news.

03:02.194 --> 03:04.460
Something has happened to Mr. Stevenson,

03:04.463 --> 03:06.112
the dean of students who recruited you.

03:06.115 --> 03:07.363
He was caught in a sting.

03:07.365 --> 03:10.206
Ooh. Mm. Like a hand
in the cookie jar sting?

03:10.209 --> 03:14.404
More like a Jared
from Subway type sting.

03:14.406 --> 03:15.838
BOTH: Oh, my God!

03:15.840 --> 03:18.358
The point is because he admitted you,

03:18.361 --> 03:20.009
and offered to let you live in his home,

03:20.011 --> 03:21.644
we're reevaluating his decisions,

03:21.646 --> 03:23.170
and therefore need you to re-audition

03:23.173 --> 03:24.614
for the admissions board tomorrow.

03:24.616 --> 03:26.249
- What?
- I have to audition again?

03:26.251 --> 03:27.584
I don't have a place to live!

03:27.586 --> 03:29.552
Can I live with you? I
can fit in a suitcase.

03:29.554 --> 03:31.042
He really can, a carry-on even.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.488
I mean, what are we supposed to do?

03:32.490 --> 03:35.458
<i>Just one more signature, and
I'm on my way to Florida.</i>

03:35.460 --> 03:37.327
Hey, you don't think
I'm doing the wrong thing

03:37.329 --> 03:38.531

03:38.533 --> 03:39.699

Chester, it's my brother.

03:40.904 --> 03:42.365
I've mentioned him several times.

03:42.367 --> 03:44.434
In my defense, you've
mentioned numerous people

03:44.436 --> 03:46.469
in your rationalization about why

03:46.471 --> 03:48.938
you're abandoning friends and family.

03:48.940 --> 03:50.607
Okay, it's not a rationalization,

03:50.609 --> 03:52.208
it's just what I'm telling
myself to feel better

03:52.210 --> 03:53.316

03:53.318 --> 03:56.779
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

Dustin Pedroia, Andre Ethier...

07:43.820 --> 07:45.422
