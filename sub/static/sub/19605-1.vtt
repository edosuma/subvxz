TEHRAN

02:30.295 --> 02:32.046
Ticket and passport, please.

02:35.134 --> 02:38.136
Ma'am, I need
your ticket and passport.

02:56.822 --> 02:58.823
Marji, stop running!

02:59.241 --> 03:01.325
Look, there's Nioucha!

03:03.328 --> 03:05.288
Marji, haven't you grown!

03:05.456 --> 03:06.789
Got a present for me?

03:06.957 --> 03:08.958
How was Paris?
You saw Bruce Lee?

03:09.126 --> 03:10.793
And the Eiffel Tower?

03:10.961 --> 03:12.003
Welcome to Tehran.

03:12.171 --> 03:14.172
- We've missed you.
- I'll take your bags.

03:14.339 --> 03:16.007
No! I'll get them.

03:16.175 --> 03:17.842
Hurry, everyone's waiting!

03:18.385 --> 03:19.719
I remember...

03:19.887 --> 03:22.513
...I led a peaceful, uneventful life...

03:22.681 --> 03:24.182
...as a little girl.

03:24.475 --> 03:28.186
I loved fries with ketchup,
Bruce Lee was my hero...

03:28.353 --> 03:31.147
...I wore Adidas sneakers,
and had two obsessions:

03:31.315 --> 03:32.523
Shaving my legs one day...

03:32.691 --> 03:34.692
...and being the last prophet
of the galaxy.

03:34.860 --> 03:35.860
Tehran 1978

03:45.412 --> 03:49.373
Slip a pencil under your breasts.
If it falls, they're great.

03:50.042 --> 03:52.084
If it sticks, they're crap.

03:52.795 --> 03:56.047
Shake her
and you'll fill a box of pencils.

03:58.008 --> 03:59.383
Calm down.

03:59.551 --> 04:01.844
They let me see him last week.

04:02.012 --> 04:03.930
The state he's in...

04:04.097 --> 04:06.390
They said they'd free him, though.

04:06.558 --> 04:09.060
- It'll soon be four years.
- Don't worry.

04:09.228 --> 04:12.355
This regime will collapse
sooner or later.

04:12.523 --> 04:14.398
Mom, Marji kicked my head!

04:15.067 --> 04:20.154
The dragon's revenge
is a bitter dish best served cold.

04:20.322 --> 04:22.698
This dragon is heading...

04:22.866 --> 04:24.075
...for a good thrashing.

04:29.248 --> 04:31.040
I, Marjane...

04:31.208 --> 04:33.543
...future prophet, hereby decide:

04:33.710 --> 04:36.796
First, everyone must behave well.

04:36.964 --> 04:40.258
Second, everyone must
keep their word.

04:40.425 --> 04:43.344
Third, everyone must do good.

04:43.720 --> 04:47.932
Fourth, the poor must all eat
one roasted chicken every day.

04:48.350 --> 04:51.394
Fifth, old women
will never suffer again.

04:51.562 --> 04:53.896
Well, Marji, in that case...

04:54.064 --> 04:55.982
...I'll be your first disciple.

04:56.149 --> 04:57.900
You will? Great!

04:58.068 --> 05:00.987
How'll you make sure
old women don't suffer?

05:01.154 --> 05:02.780
It'll be forbidden.

05:02.948 --> 05:05.449
Why didn't I think of that?

05:05.617 --> 05:06.993
What's going on?

05:08.120 --> 05:13.291
Down with the Shah! Down with
the Shah! Down with the Shah!

05:20.716 --> 05:21.883
I knew it!

05:22.050 --> 05:23.050
I told you so!

05:23.218 --> 05:24.427
I knew it!

05:25.804 --> 05:28.306
This is a historic moment!

05:35.314 --> 05:37.148
He'll pay for what he's done.

05:37.316 --> 05:40.443
Your poor father
will be avenged at last.

05:40.611 --> 05:43.154
The Shah can join his pals
in Washington.

05:43.322 --> 05:47.074
Personally,
I think I like the Shah.

05:48.035 --> 05:49.827
He was chosen by God.

05:50.954 --> 05:52.788
Absolutely.

05:52.956 --> 05:54.665
God told me so Himself.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.918
God and my teacher too.

05:57.711 --> 06:00.004
The Shah wasn't chosen by God.

06:00.172 --> 06:02.340
That's not true! My teacher...

06:05.010 --> 06:06.677
That's what people say.

06:06.845 --> 06:08.888
Here's what really happened.

06:09.056 --> 06:11.349
The truth is, 50 years ago...

06:11.516 --> 06:13.684
...the Shah's father,
an army officer...

06:13.852 --> 06:16.854
...wanted to overthrow
the Qadjar emperor.

06:17.022 --> 06:18.356
As Ataturk did in Turkey.

06:18.523 --> 06:21.984
I shall modernize Iran
and make it a republic!

06:22.152 --> 06:25.029
The English heard about this,
and one day...

06:25.197 --> 06:28.866
Hello! Why create a republic...

06:29.034 --> 06:31.369
...when you could be emperor?

06:31.536 --> 06:33.204
Me? Emperor?

06:33.455 --> 06:34.747
Of course!

06:34.915 --> 06:37.041
It's better than being president.

06:37.209 --> 06:39.293
You'll have all the power.

06:39.461 --> 06:41.253
A country like yours...

06:41.463 --> 06:44.840
...needs a strong man like you
to lead it.

06:46.218 --> 06:47.551
You have a point.

06:47.886 --> 06:49.387
Besides...

06:49.554 --> 06:53.015
...the religious leaders
are against a republic...

06:53.183 --> 06:55.851
...and, frankly, they're right.

06:56.019 --> 06:57.853
What do I have to do?

06:58.021 --> 07:00.606
Nothing. Just give us the oil...

07:00.774 --> 07:03.234
...and we'll take care of the rest.

07:06.905 --> 07:09.407
I'm the king now!

07:09.574 --> 07:11.909
All your property is mine!

07:12.077 --> 07:14.286
So, in fact, he was a moron.

07:14.913 --> 07:15.913
Yes and no.

07:16.123 --> 07:18.916
He was a dictator,
but he modernized Iran.

07:19.084 --> 07:21.210
In a way, he loved his country...

07:21.378 --> 07:23.421
...unlike his son
who succeeded him.

07:23.588 --> 07:25.297
I'm the king now!

07:25.507 --> 07:27.591
I'm the light of the Aryans.

07:27.759 --> 07:31.595
I'll make this country
the most modern one ever!

07:31.763 --> 07:34.890
Our people will regain
their splendor.

07:35.726 --> 07:38.519
Yes, the Shah's father
was very cruel.

07:38.687 --> 07:40.563
He even jailed your grandpa.

07:40.731 --> 07:42.732
But his son is ten times worse.

07:42.941 --> 07:44.442
Grandpa was in jail?

07:44.735 --> 07:46.777
Yes. He had royal blood.

07:46.945 --> 07:48.946
He was a Qadjar prince.

07:49.114 --> 07:51.282
The Shah's father ruined him.

07:51.450 --> 07:54.618
He was jailed above all
for being a communist.

08:00.083 --> 08:05.129
My grandpa was a Qadjar prince
and a "communiss."

09:09.569 --> 09:10.653
Dear God.

09:10.821 --> 09:13.531
You're alive!
I was worried sick.

09:13.698 --> 09:16.826
- They opened fire on the crowd.
- We had a close call, Grandma.

09:16.993 --> 09:20.204
Tadji and I ran,
but the soldiers cornered us.

09:20.622 --> 09:22.748
Those bastards took my film.

09:22.916 --> 09:25.668
- They held us for hours.
- Marji was so excited.

09:25.836 --> 09:29.505
She went on about proles,
peasants, the class struggle...

09:29.673 --> 09:32.383
...and that bearded guy,
Che "Guevero."

09:32.551 --> 09:34.885
The boy shot next to us
wasn't even 20.

09:35.053 --> 09:36.929
What's happened
to this country?

09:37.097 --> 09:39.056
Right now, it's a shit hole, my dear.

09:39.224 --> 09:41.851
- Down with the Shah!
- Here we go again.

09:42.018 --> 09:44.436
Down with the Shah!
Down with the Shah!

09:45.355 --> 09:47.398
Marji, go to bed. Right now!

09:48.525 --> 09:52.570
Down with the Shah.
Down with the Shah.

09:54.072 --> 09:56.282
I've understood your revolt.

09:56.575 --> 10:00.452
Together, we shall try
to march towards democracy...

10:01.246 --> 10:03.372
...building the future hand in hand.

10:26.479 --> 10:27.605
Siamak!

10:27.772 --> 10:29.773
- They let you out.
- Hello, Ebi.

10:29.941 --> 10:32.193
It's Siamak. He's back.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.819
Hello, Tadji.

10:34.613 --> 10:37.114
Come in.
We're so glad you're alive!

10:37.782 --> 10:38.782
Come in.

10:38.950 --> 10:40.951
Don't just stand there.

10:43.997 --> 10:45.748
This must be Marjane.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.249
How you've grown.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.460
You were just a baby before.

10:49.628 --> 10:52.713
And now you're a young lady.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.092
Who is that guy?

10:57.260 --> 10:59.637
My father. He was in jail.

10:59.804 --> 11:01.597
He's a hero.

11:02.641 --> 11:05.643
There were scientists
who knew the whole body.

11:05.810 --> 11:08.145
They knew what caused
the most pain.

11:10.732 --> 11:13.317
They whipped me
with cables so much...

11:13.485 --> 11:16.487
...my foot isn't like a foot anymore.

11:16.655 --> 11:17.696
And why?

11:17.864 --> 11:21.033
The foot's nerves
are linked to the brain.

11:21.660 --> 11:22.993
The pain's incredible.

11:24.329 --> 11:27.331
Our torturers were trained
by the CIA.

11:29.751 --> 11:32.294
They certainly knew their stuff.

11:32.462 --> 11:34.672
What happened to Hamid?

11:36.091 --> 11:38.008
Hamid was killed.

11:39.344 --> 11:42.012
As a guerrilla member,
he suffered horribly.

11:42.514 --> 11:45.057
He had cyanide on him
just in case...

11:45.267 --> 11:47.393
...but he wasn't able to use it.

11:47.894 --> 11:50.020
He had the worst torture.

11:52.691 --> 11:54.858
The loser gets tortured to death.

11:55.026 --> 11:57.528
- Cool!
- What kind of torture?

11:58.196 --> 12:01.365
We'll hit him on the head
with a cable!

12:04.828 --> 12:07.496
But first he has to put this
in his mouth...

12:07.664 --> 12:09.540
...and chew it three times.

12:13.503 --> 12:15.004
Look. It's Ramine.

12:15.171 --> 12:19.008
I heard that his dad
was in the Shah's secret police.

12:19.301 --> 12:23.512
His dad killed a million people
with his own bare hands.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.888
A million?

12:25.390 --> 12:26.515
Absolutely!

12:26.683 --> 12:27.891
In their name...

12:28.059 --> 12:30.728
...we'll teach Ramine a lesson.

12:37.402 --> 12:39.403
We'll rip his eyes out.

12:51.249 --> 12:54.126
Marjane! What are you up to?

12:54.336 --> 12:56.587
- Marji found nails!
- We'll beat Ramine up.

12:56.755 --> 12:58.297
We'll rip his eyes out!

12:58.465 --> 13:01.342
What if I nailed your ears
to the wall?

13:03.553 --> 13:07.097
Go to your room and stay there
until I say so!

13:23.656 --> 13:25.491
Marjane,
what's the matter with you?

13:25.658 --> 13:28.660
That's no way
for a future prophet to behave.

13:28.870 --> 13:32.122
But, Lord, Ramine's father
killed people.

13:32.290 --> 13:35.459
Marjane.
That's not poor Ramine's fault.

13:35.627 --> 13:38.253
His father's crimes
aren't his doing.

13:38.630 --> 13:41.256
The wicked will pay one day.

13:41.424 --> 13:43.467
Have faith in my justice.

13:43.635 --> 13:45.094
You cannot wield it.

13:45.261 --> 13:47.262
Your duty is to forgive.

13:52.394 --> 13:54.395
- Ramine...
- What do you want?

13:54.562 --> 13:58.440
It's not your fault
your father's a murderer.

13:58.608 --> 13:59.817
So I forgive you.

14:01.486 --> 14:03.612
He only ever killed communists...

14:03.780 --> 14:05.656
...and communists are evil!

14:10.412 --> 14:12.830
In the months after the Shah left...

14:12.997 --> 14:14.873
...the country was euphoric.

14:15.041 --> 14:16.959
Everyone had been a revolutionary.

14:17.127 --> 14:19.044
Everyone had fought the Shah.

14:19.212 --> 14:21.338
Our neighbor's birthmark...

14:21.506 --> 14:24.425
...had magically become
a war wound.

14:24.717 --> 14:27.553
Our teacher, who loved the Shah...

14:27.720 --> 14:31.640
...made us tear up the photos
of the royal family in our books.

14:31.850 --> 14:33.809
Political rallies thrived...

14:33.977 --> 14:35.686
...and the old internal enemies...

14:35.854 --> 14:38.689
...became national heroes.

14:38.857 --> 14:42.776
In this merry chaos,
Uncle Anoush came into my life.

14:42.944 --> 14:45.446
Things will get better now.

14:45.613 --> 14:47.865
Nothing will stop the people.

14:48.032 --> 14:51.743
We'll have a society
of justice and freedom at last.

14:52.245 --> 14:55.539
As Lenin predicted,
the proletariat will rule.

14:55.707 --> 14:58.417
Uncle Anoush,
how long were you in jail?

14:58.585 --> 15:01.503
- Nine years.
- Wow! More than Laly's dad.

15:01.671 --> 15:03.547
Are you married? A communist?

15:03.715 --> 15:07.217
Marji, give your uncle
time to digest.

15:07.385 --> 15:08.886
She's so inquisitive.

15:09.053 --> 15:11.513
You're right.
It's good to be curious.

15:11.681 --> 15:13.015
Have you digested?

15:13.183 --> 15:14.725
Enough! It's time for bed!

15:16.227 --> 15:19.980
Put your pajamas on.
I'll come and tell you everything.

15:21.065 --> 15:22.399
Elections are soon.

15:22.567 --> 15:27.404
Trust the people. They'll do all they can
to keep their freedom now.

15:27.572 --> 15:30.407
It can't be worse
than under the Shah.

15:31.075 --> 15:33.160
I'm ready!

15:33.328 --> 15:35.954
Watch out, she'll eat you alive.

15:36.122 --> 15:38.081
I'm ready!

15:38.583 --> 15:40.751
I'll start at the beginning.

15:40.919 --> 15:43.879
I was 18 when my Uncle Fereydoun
and his friends...

15:44.047 --> 15:48.258
...proclaimed the Iranian province
of Azerbaijan independent.

15:49.385 --> 15:54.014
Fereydoun named himself
the minister of justice.

15:55.266 --> 15:57.226
Democracy is based on justice.

15:57.393 --> 16:00.020
All men must be equal
before the law.

16:00.939 --> 16:03.565
We shared ideas,
so I became his secretary.

16:04.025 --> 16:05.776
This is just the beginning.

16:05.944 --> 16:07.778
We shall liberate Iran...

16:07.946 --> 16:10.572
...province by province, city by city.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.074
I'm sure we will.

16:12.534 --> 16:14.618
It wasn't easy to follow him...

16:14.786 --> 16:17.120
...for my father was loyal
to the Shah.

16:17.288 --> 16:18.622
My son is a traitor!

16:18.790 --> 16:21.458
Go and join my idiotic brother.

16:21.626 --> 16:24.962
You'll all end up shot, you hear?
Shot!

16:25.255 --> 16:27.673
My father turned out to be right.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.132
And one morning...

16:29.592 --> 16:31.343
My God! Fereydoun!

16:31.636 --> 16:33.804
I had to flee. I had no choice.

16:34.472 --> 16:37.057
While my uncle
faced his fate alone.

16:57.954 --> 17:01.206
I walked for days
through the snow and blizzards.

17:01.374 --> 17:04.001
I was hungry and cold
but kept going.

17:05.587 --> 17:09.839
I crossed the Alborz Mountains
to go to my parents in Astara.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.346
Who's bothering me this late?

17:16.513 --> 17:18.848
My God, Anoush!

17:19.017 --> 17:20.684
Our son. He's half-dead.

17:20.852 --> 17:22.185
My darling son!

17:24.146 --> 17:25.521
My son...

17:25.690 --> 17:28.317
My darling son, forgive me.

17:28.693 --> 17:31.820
I couldn't stay.
The Shah's army was after me.

17:31.988 --> 17:33.697
I went into exile.

17:52.675 --> 17:55.552
I swam across the Aras River...

17:55.720 --> 17:58.221
...and arrived in the USSR.

18:00.433 --> 18:01.892
What did you do then?

18:02.060 --> 18:04.770
I went to Leningrad,
then Moscow.

18:04.937 --> 18:07.606
I did a doctorate
in Marxism-Leninism.

18:07.774 --> 18:10.275
But I missed my family
more and more.

18:10.443 --> 18:13.612
I tried to come back in disguise,
with forged papers...

18:13.780 --> 18:15.072
...but it didn't work.

18:15.239 --> 18:16.615
They arrested me.

18:16.783 --> 18:18.116
You went to jail?

18:18.284 --> 18:20.410
Yes. You know...

18:20.578 --> 18:23.914
...I'm telling you this
because you need to know.

18:24.082 --> 18:26.333
The family memory must live on.

18:26.876 --> 18:29.961
Even if it's not easy
for you to understand.

18:30.171 --> 18:33.715
Don't worry, Uncle Anoush,
I'll never forget.

18:34.550 --> 18:35.926
Were you married?

18:36.094 --> 18:38.929
It's late now. Go to sleep.

18:39.597 --> 18:41.056
This is for you.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.809
I made it in prison.

18:44.519 --> 18:46.228
Out of bread.

18:57.990 --> 19:02.077
99.99% of the people
have voted democratically...

19:02.245 --> 19:03.954
...for the Islamic Republic.

19:04.122 --> 19:08.041
It's normal, every revolution
has a period of transition.

19:08.459 --> 19:10.460
Half the country is illiterate.

19:10.628 --> 19:15.549
Only nationalism and religion
can unite people.

19:16.676 --> 19:20.804
Mina and her family have left.
They say it's too dangerous here.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.517
They found Mohsen
drowned in his bath.

19:26.644 --> 19:29.062
Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

19:29.355 --> 19:33.859
Siamak and his family have fled.
The bastards killed his sister.

19:35.194 --> 19:37.404
Maybe we should leave Iran too.

19:37.572 --> 19:40.866
So you can be a maid
and I can drive a taxi?

19:42.160 --> 19:44.786
We'll purge
anti-revolutionary elements.

19:44.996 --> 19:47.289
Only one law will prevail:

19:47.498 --> 19:48.498
That of blood.

20:00.094 --> 20:01.595
Marji...

20:04.348 --> 20:06.391
They've arrested Anoush.

20:06.559 --> 20:08.143
I know.

20:11.439 --> 20:12.606
Dad...

20:12.774 --> 20:14.357
It will be all right.

20:15.067 --> 20:17.235
Do you want to do something
for him?

20:17.862 --> 20:21.364
He's allowed one visit.
He wants to see you.

20:24.118 --> 20:25.118
I'll go.

20:39.509 --> 20:40.759
Ten minutes.

20:47.767 --> 20:49.309
What a pretty dress.

20:49.936 --> 20:52.187
What a beautiful girl.

20:58.820 --> 21:01.404
You know that your visit
honors me?

21:04.784 --> 21:07.869
You're the daughter
I'd have loved to have.

21:08.412 --> 21:09.830
You'll see.

21:09.997 --> 21:12.958
One day, the proletariat will rule.

21:13.251 --> 21:14.751
Here.

21:14.919 --> 21:17.254
I made you another bread swan.

21:17.922 --> 21:20.298
It's the first one's uncle.

21:25.388 --> 21:27.472
Star of my life...

21:47.368 --> 21:49.619
What's wrong, my child?

21:49.787 --> 21:51.037
Don't be sad.

21:51.205 --> 21:52.539
Shut up.

21:52.707 --> 21:54.958
You didn't stop them
from killing him.

21:55.376 --> 21:57.210
It's not my fault. Men did it.

21:57.378 --> 21:59.754
Shut up! Never come back again!

21:59.922 --> 22:04.467
Get out!

22:25.907 --> 22:29.534
One year after the revolution,
Iraq attacked Iran.

22:29.702 --> 22:32.787
Saddam struck
a vulnerable country.

22:33.205 --> 22:36.333
The revolution
and purges in the army...

22:36.500 --> 22:38.543
...had vastly weakened us.

22:38.711 --> 22:41.004
In the name of
fighting the external enemy...

22:41.172 --> 22:43.632
...the state exterminated
the internal one:

22:43.799 --> 22:46.676
The opponents
to the Shah's regime.

22:47.219 --> 22:50.597
Arrests and executions
took place daily.

22:50.765 --> 22:52.849
Everyone was afraid.

22:53.017 --> 22:57.062
The new government adopted
even more repressive laws.

22:57.563 --> 22:58.855
In two years...

22:59.023 --> 23:01.942
...every aspect
of our lives changed.

23:02.109 --> 23:03.818
And so did we.

23:05.696 --> 23:08.657
All right, children!
On the heart for our martyrs!

23:08.824 --> 23:10.617
Daughters and sons of Iran...

23:11.202 --> 23:13.662
...the war has killed
our best children.

23:13.829 --> 23:17.082
The truth will soon rise up
from their blood.

23:17.249 --> 23:19.042
For whom did they die?

23:19.585 --> 23:23.380
For us!

23:32.390 --> 23:33.640
Martyr.

23:33.808 --> 23:35.976
Martyr!

23:36.143 --> 23:37.936
Finish me!

23:38.104 --> 23:39.562
What are you doing?

23:39.730 --> 23:42.065
I'm suffering. Can't you see?

23:42.733 --> 23:44.192
Go to class now!

23:44.568 --> 23:47.612
Tehran 1982

23:48.239 --> 23:50.615
The veil stands for freedom.

23:50.783 --> 23:54.703
A decent woman shelters herself
from men's eyes.

23:54.870 --> 23:58.623
A woman who shows herself
will burn in hell.

23:58.791 --> 24:00.125
Hey, have you seen this?

24:00.292 --> 24:03.086
Our soldiers die every day
on our borders...

24:03.254 --> 24:06.047
...to save our dear land
from indecency.

24:06.257 --> 24:07.257
Look!

24:08.300 --> 24:10.385
Abba is for wimps.

24:18.144 --> 24:20.812
Leave in single file. Hurry!

24:33.200 --> 24:35.201
Mom, what's for dinner?

24:35.786 --> 24:37.495
How about a nice chili?

24:37.663 --> 24:39.873
Yeah! It'll make us fart!

24:41.459 --> 24:42.542
Give me that!

24:42.710 --> 24:44.127
I saw it first!

24:44.295 --> 24:46.379
- Sure, bitch!
- Stop that!

24:46.714 --> 24:49.299
Look at you, fighting like animals.

24:49.717 --> 24:51.634
We should show solidarity.

24:52.803 --> 24:55.138
- What's her problem?
- Who asked you?

25:07.359 --> 25:08.943
Your scarf, sister.

25:11.655 --> 25:12.739
You, woman!

25:12.907 --> 25:16.034
Sir, you don't say "woman,"
you say "ma'am."

25:16.702 --> 25:18.995
- Show some respect, please.
- Respect you?

25:19.163 --> 25:22.707
I screw women like you
and dump them in the trash.

25:23.459 --> 25:24.876
Get in!

25:43.020 --> 25:44.187
Are you okay?

25:44.522 --> 25:46.731
Yes, dear, I'm fine.

25:49.860 --> 25:51.027
Move it!

25:52.196 --> 25:53.863
Shut up, bastard!

27:43.098 --> 27:45.975
Mom, you have to give me
50 tomans.

27:46.143 --> 27:47.769
Really? What for?

27:47.937 --> 27:50.605
They're selling tapes
on Gandhi Avenue.

27:50.773 --> 27:51.814
Bee Gees tapes?

27:51.982 --> 27:54.609
Mom! The Bee Gees suck!

27:59.657 --> 28:01.074
"Estivie" Wonder.

28:01.242 --> 28:02.408
Julio Iglesias.

28:02.576 --> 28:03.826
Pink Floyd.

28:04.161 --> 28:05.495
"Jickael Mackson."

28:06.121 --> 28:08.331
Lipstick, varnish, playing cards.

28:08.499 --> 28:10.166
Iron Maiden.

28:11.293 --> 28:12.752
- How much?
- One hundred tomans.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.588
- Fifty.
- Sixty.

28:15.756 --> 28:17.340
- Fifty.
- Fifty.

28:21.512 --> 28:22.720
What's that outfit?

28:23.222 --> 28:24.639
And those punk shoes?

28:24.807 --> 28:26.516
- What punk shoes?
- Those!

28:26.725 --> 28:28.142
They're sneakers.

28:28.310 --> 28:29.519
That style is punk.

28:29.687 --> 28:32.063
I'm on my school's basketball team.

28:32.231 --> 28:34.190
Is that a basketball jacket?

28:34.358 --> 28:36.317
What's that? Michael Jackson!

28:36.527 --> 28:38.569
That symbol of Western decadence!

28:38.737 --> 28:41.197
No, ma'am, it's...

28:42.199 --> 28:43.199
Malcolm X!

28:43.367 --> 28:45.118
- Michael Jackson!
- Your scarf, slut!

28:45.286 --> 28:47.078
You're coming with us!

28:47.246 --> 28:49.205
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

28:49.373 --> 28:51.624
Ma'am, my mother is dead.

28:51.792 --> 28:53.501
My stepmother's so cruel.

28:53.669 --> 28:55.753
If I'm late, she'll kill me!

28:55.921 --> 28:58.256
She'll burn me with an iron.

28:58.465 --> 29:01.342
She'll make my dad
put me in an orphanage!

29:01.552 --> 29:02.593
Have mercy!

29:02.761 --> 29:05.972
Please, ma'am, have mercy!

29:43.844 --> 29:48.890
Today, our army destroyed
63 Iraqi tanks and 26 fighter planes.

29:49.266 --> 29:52.477
Our martyrs' blood
irrigates our land...

29:52.644 --> 29:55.313
...and feeds deserts of hope.

29:55.481 --> 29:59.317
To die a martyr is to inject blood
into the veins of society.

30:12.373 --> 30:15.249
Is everything all right,
Mrs. Nassrine?

30:15.417 --> 30:16.667
No, it isn't.

30:16.835 --> 30:19.212
They gave my son this at school.

30:19.380 --> 30:22.006
They said
that if he fights and dies...

30:22.174 --> 30:25.385
...this key will get him into heaven.
This plastic key!

30:25.803 --> 30:28.971
They said heaven is full of food...

30:29.139 --> 30:31.140
...women, gold houses
and diamonds!

30:31.308 --> 30:32.975
Women?

30:33.936 --> 30:36.604
Well, he's 14.
Women interest him.

30:36.772 --> 30:38.272
I've suffered so much.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.359
I've raised five children
with my tears.

30:41.527 --> 30:44.695
Now they want to swap my oldest
for this key.

30:44.863 --> 30:47.156
I've always been devout.

30:47.324 --> 30:50.618
I've prayed, I've worn the veil,
I've obeyed.

30:51.328 --> 30:54.247
But I can't believe in anything
anymore.

30:55.332 --> 30:56.582
It's me. Did you hear?

30:56.750 --> 31:00.795
They arrested the Roshanis.
They found alcohol and playing cards.

31:00.963 --> 31:02.964
Why are you covering your head?

31:05.342 --> 31:06.843
For your husband.

31:07.177 --> 31:10.054
That's how we were brought up.

31:11.223 --> 31:12.348
Don't worry.

31:12.516 --> 31:14.559
I'll talk to your son.

31:15.185 --> 31:19.188
Thanks to my parents,
her son never went to war.

31:21.525 --> 31:22.942
Between air raids...

31:23.110 --> 31:25.862
...government repression
and spying neighbors...

31:26.029 --> 31:28.614
...life tried to follow its course.

31:36.206 --> 31:39.709
To make everything bearable,
people had parties...

31:39.877 --> 31:41.711
...safe from prying eyes.

31:41.879 --> 31:43.754
They were often boozy.

31:43.922 --> 31:45.798
Alcohol was banned...

31:45.966 --> 31:48.718
...but my uncle Taher
supplied us with wine.

31:49.470 --> 31:53.681
He had built a winemaking lab
in his basement.

31:53.849 --> 31:55.057
Mrs. Nassrine...

31:55.225 --> 31:58.769
...who cleaned for him too,
helped crush the grapes.

31:58.937 --> 32:01.314
God forgive me.

32:02.441 --> 32:04.609
Attending these parties was risky.

32:04.776 --> 32:08.154
But it was the only bit of freedom
we had left.

32:12.034 --> 32:13.075
Come on.

32:13.243 --> 32:14.785
Get out!

32:14.953 --> 32:16.829
ID, registration, license.

32:18.916 --> 32:20.249
Come here.

32:20.751 --> 32:22.293
Breathe!

32:22.461 --> 32:23.711
- Been drinking?
- No.

32:23.879 --> 32:27.006
- Liar. You Westernized trash.
- Enough.

32:27.174 --> 32:30.009
I work for this country.
How dare you!

32:30.344 --> 32:32.887
- Forgive him.
- Shut up!

32:33.055 --> 32:36.015
I could be your mother.
How old are you? Fifteen?

32:36.183 --> 32:38.601
Sixteen? My daughter is 13.

32:41.271 --> 32:43.397
If not for your wife,
you'd be in hell.

32:43.565 --> 32:44.857
Thank you!

32:45.859 --> 32:49.278
Get in. Let's see
if you have bottles at home.

32:49.905 --> 32:52.823
Grandma, Marji, go up first.
I'll stall them.

32:52.991 --> 32:56.160
- Empty all the bottles.
- But how?

32:56.328 --> 32:59.789
Don't worry, I was used to it
with your father.

32:59.957 --> 33:02.458
I always had to hide his tracks.

33:03.544 --> 33:07.964
Our neighbor is an elderly man
with a heart condition.

33:08.131 --> 33:11.008
Any sudden noise could kill him.

33:11.677 --> 33:14.303
Perhaps we can
work something out...

33:14.471 --> 33:16.514
Where are you two going?

33:16.682 --> 33:18.474
I have diabetes, my boy.

33:18.642 --> 33:20.977
Without syrup, I'm going to faint.

33:21.353 --> 33:23.646
Diabetes? Like my mother.

33:23.814 --> 33:25.648
All right.

33:45.752 --> 33:47.295
Where are they?

33:47.462 --> 33:51.841
Arrogant, but no ideology.
A few bills made them forget.

33:53.343 --> 33:55.344
You didn't throw it all out?

33:56.179 --> 33:57.179
Yes, we did.

33:57.347 --> 33:59.181
Shit...

34:09.109 --> 34:11.277
It's his heart again.

34:11.445 --> 34:14.322
They were after communists
near our house.

34:14.489 --> 34:16.032
They threw a grenade.

34:16.199 --> 34:18.034
Taher couldn't take it.

34:18.201 --> 34:21.078
I found him on the floor
in the living room.

34:21.246 --> 34:22.788
It will be all right.

34:22.956 --> 34:24.748
No, it won't.

34:24.916 --> 34:27.835
He needs open-heart surgery.

34:28.003 --> 34:30.588
They can't do it here.

34:31.214 --> 34:33.507
They say he has to go to England.

34:33.967 --> 34:36.927
I went to see the hospital director.

34:37.638 --> 34:39.054
You won't believe it.

34:39.222 --> 34:40.598
Know who he is?

34:40.766 --> 34:43.184
My old window washer!

34:43.518 --> 34:47.480
I pretended not to know him
so as not to humiliate him.

34:47.648 --> 34:51.942
With the borders closed,
only the very sick can go abroad.

34:52.110 --> 34:54.235
It's his third coronary.

34:54.487 --> 34:57.406
He needs an operation abroad
or he'll die!

34:57.574 --> 34:59.450
We'll do our best.

34:59.618 --> 35:01.952
If God wills it, he'll get better.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.621
It all depends on God.

35:03.997 --> 35:07.458
I need your authorization
to get his passport.

35:07.793 --> 35:09.919
If God wills it.

35:10.128 --> 35:13.589
Thanks to a beard and suit
this idiotic window washer...

35:13.757 --> 35:15.341
...runs a hospital now!

35:15.509 --> 35:18.719
My husband's fate
depends on a window washer!

35:18.929 --> 35:21.972
He's so religious
he won't look at a woman.

35:22.140 --> 35:23.265
The stupid bastard!

35:25.310 --> 35:28.145
I know someone
who makes passports.

35:28.313 --> 35:30.314
I'll go see him. It'll all be okay.

35:30.482 --> 35:32.650
Wait. I'll come too.

35:36.571 --> 35:38.155
Where did I put it?

35:39.157 --> 35:41.033
Here it is! Look at this.

35:41.201 --> 35:42.451
It looks real, huh?

35:43.620 --> 35:46.372
A whole month's work went into this.

35:46.540 --> 35:49.041
You're cute. What's your name?

35:49.209 --> 35:51.460
How long to make a passport?

35:52.504 --> 35:54.714
Passports are in high demand.

35:55.507 --> 35:57.758
They're how I make my living now.

35:58.051 --> 35:59.844
Usually, it takes two weeks.

36:00.011 --> 36:01.721
But I can do it in one.

36:01.888 --> 36:04.473
Perfect, but hurry.

36:07.310 --> 36:08.894
It's only Niloufar.

36:09.646 --> 36:13.274
Meet Ebi. I told you
about his brother Anoush.

36:13.442 --> 36:14.483
Hello.

36:14.651 --> 36:16.193
She's a communist too.

36:16.361 --> 36:20.364
Her brother was my messenger boy
so I hide her here.

36:20.532 --> 36:22.742
It's the only place she's safe.

36:39.634 --> 36:41.927
Is he dumb or what?

36:42.095 --> 36:43.637
He'll get crushed.

36:44.222 --> 36:46.807
There! What did I tell you?

36:53.231 --> 36:54.482
Don't look.

36:54.649 --> 36:56.525
- It's horrible.
- Grandma, stop it!

36:59.154 --> 37:00.488
What a load of crap.

37:00.655 --> 37:02.740
The Japanese
either gut themselves...

37:02.908 --> 37:06.327
...or make hideous monsters.
That's all they ever seem to do.

37:13.043 --> 37:15.669
Grandma,
will Uncle Taher die?

37:15.837 --> 37:18.088
- Of course.
- You think so?

37:18.256 --> 37:21.300
Without a passport,
he won't make it.

37:24.137 --> 37:26.722
- He smoked too much.
- Bullshit!

37:27.098 --> 37:29.391
His heart's not failing
from cigarettes.

37:29.559 --> 37:31.977
His kids are too far away.

37:32.604 --> 37:35.564
A portion of beans,
piping hot, please.

37:36.441 --> 37:39.109
Children always leave.
That's normal.

37:39.277 --> 37:43.697
But having to part with them at 13
due to an absurd war...

37:44.449 --> 37:45.908
...that breaks your heart.

37:48.662 --> 37:52.081
In Taher's shoes,
I'd be dead and buried by now.

37:52.582 --> 37:56.252
- May God eradicate these barbarians.
- May God hear you.

38:08.557 --> 38:12.101
Khosrow, it's you.
Is the package ready?

38:12.269 --> 38:15.479
They arrested Niloufar
and trashed my place!

38:29.578 --> 38:31.787
Niloufar was executed.

38:33.665 --> 38:37.793
Khosrow fled to Turkey
and then to Sweden.

38:42.465 --> 38:44.633
Three weeks later...

38:44.801 --> 38:46.635
...we buried Uncle Taher.

38:49.347 --> 38:51.515
The war intensified.

38:56.646 --> 38:58.188
Let me through.

38:58.356 --> 39:01.108
Excuse me. Let me through.

39:01.484 --> 39:02.568
Stop!

39:02.736 --> 39:04.653
I live over there.

39:04.821 --> 39:06.655
Go on.

39:27.510 --> 39:29.678
- Marji!
- Mom.

39:31.181 --> 39:32.306
Are you hurt?

39:32.474 --> 39:34.350
No, sweetie, we're fine.

39:34.517 --> 39:36.226
Where did the missile land?

39:37.812 --> 39:40.522
The Baba Levy's house.

40:03.129 --> 40:07.424
Under our new government,
we no longer have political prisoners.

40:07.634 --> 40:08.717
Ma'am?

40:08.885 --> 40:11.512
We have paid a high price
for our liberty.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.555
- Ma'am.
- What now, Satrapi?

40:13.723 --> 40:18.143
My uncle was jailed by the Shah,
but the new regime had him shot.

40:18.311 --> 40:21.689
We have gone from 3,000 prisoners
under the Shah...

40:21.856 --> 40:23.482
...to 300,000 with you.

40:23.650 --> 40:26.568
How dare you lie to us like this?

40:26.736 --> 40:28.153
Stop that!

40:37.747 --> 40:40.040
- Who was it?
- The principal.

40:40.208 --> 40:42.710
Marji told her teacher off.

40:42.877 --> 40:45.462
- Again?
- Just like her uncle.

40:45.672 --> 40:49.425
What? You want her
to end up like him? Executed?

40:49.592 --> 40:51.301
You know what they do
to young girls?

40:51.469 --> 40:53.971
You know what they did to Niloufar?

40:54.180 --> 40:58.267
It's illegal to kill a virgin,
so a guard married her...

40:58.435 --> 41:00.227
...and took her virginity first!

41:00.395 --> 41:02.187
You know what that means?

41:03.940 --> 41:06.191
If they touch you, I'll kill them!

41:07.193 --> 41:10.821
Shortly after,
they decided to send me abroad.

41:11.281 --> 41:14.742
Since I had attended
the French school in Tehran...

41:14.909 --> 41:17.661
...I went to the French school
in Vienna.

41:17.829 --> 41:19.830
My father got me a visa.

41:19.998 --> 41:23.625
I'd stay with my mother's friend
and her family.

41:23.793 --> 41:25.544
The day before I left...

41:25.712 --> 41:27.713
...Grandma slept at our house.

41:29.007 --> 41:33.135
Every morning, she'd put jasmine
in her bra to smell good.

41:33.803 --> 41:37.306
When she undressed,
the flowers fell from her breasts.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.475
It was magical.

41:39.642 --> 41:43.479
How come your breasts
are so round at your age?

41:44.147 --> 41:48.817
I soak them in a bowl of iced water
for ten minutes every day.

41:51.029 --> 41:52.696
I'll miss you.

41:53.573 --> 41:55.991
I'll come to see you.

41:57.619 --> 41:59.078
Listen.

41:59.245 --> 42:03.874
I don't like to preach,
but here's some advice.

42:04.042 --> 42:07.461
You'll meet a lot of jerks in life.

42:07.629 --> 42:12.007
If they hurt you,
remember it's because they're stupid.

42:12.175 --> 42:15.094
Don't react to their cruelty.

42:15.261 --> 42:18.931
There's nothing worse
than bitterness and revenge.

42:19.099 --> 42:23.852
Keep your dignity
and be true to yourself.

42:29.317 --> 42:31.527
Everything will be all right.

42:32.195 --> 42:34.530
No tears. Think of your future.

42:34.697 --> 42:36.448
Europe awaits you.

42:36.616 --> 42:39.785
When you get to Vienna,
have a Sachertorte.

42:39.953 --> 42:41.912
It's a delicious chocolate cake.

42:42.080 --> 42:43.664
We'll come to visit.

42:43.832 --> 42:45.124
You're a big girl.

42:45.291 --> 42:46.750
No tears.

42:46.918 --> 42:50.087
- Dad.
- Enough. You have to go now.

42:50.421 --> 42:53.757
Never forget who you are
and where you're from.

42:53.925 --> 42:55.717
My daughter.

42:56.886 --> 42:59.388
- Mom.
- My little Marji.

44:01.159 --> 44:02.659
Europe awaited.

44:02.869 --> 44:04.953
But not the way I imagined.

44:05.413 --> 44:07.956
After a few days
at my mother's friend's...

44:08.124 --> 44:11.668
...she decided her place
was too small.

44:13.129 --> 44:14.796
She found lodgings...

44:14.964 --> 44:17.257
...where I'd be fine...

44:17.425 --> 44:19.301
...according to her.

44:35.443 --> 44:36.652
What?

45:15.191 --> 45:16.650
I was delighted...

45:16.818 --> 45:21.321
...to find stores packed with goods
that had vanished at home.

45:22.991 --> 45:24.658
For a while...

45:24.826 --> 45:27.869
...going to the supermarket
was my favorite pastime.

45:28.037 --> 45:32.332
My favorite pastime.

45:32.500 --> 45:36.253
In short,
I needed to make friends fast.

45:41.092 --> 45:44.386
Luckily, at school,
I could understand the others...

45:44.554 --> 45:46.471
...and could get myself understood.

45:46.889 --> 45:48.640
Got a smoke?

45:50.643 --> 45:53.854
I was the center of attention
for all the outsiders.

45:54.022 --> 45:57.524
People like Momo, Thierry,
Olivier and Eve.

45:57.692 --> 46:00.485
My nationality and story
fascinated them.

46:00.695 --> 46:03.071
You saw a revolution and a war?

46:03.239 --> 46:04.698
Well, yeah.

46:04.866 --> 46:07.409
- You saw lots of dead people?
- A few.

46:09.287 --> 46:10.579
That's wild.

46:15.918 --> 46:18.045
I was soon part of the gang.

46:18.212 --> 46:20.714
Momo introduced me
to nonchalance...

46:20.882 --> 46:22.966
...the concept of forced nihilism...

46:23.134 --> 46:25.093
...and Vienna's sub-culture.

46:39.609 --> 46:42.444
I had trouble adapting at first.

46:43.529 --> 46:46.448
But then I thought, "Why not?"

46:48.951 --> 46:51.953
I convinced myself
I'd found my place.

46:52.914 --> 46:54.998
But I wasn't like them.

46:55.166 --> 46:58.627
As school holidays reminded me.

46:58.795 --> 47:00.253
Shit. Christmas again.

47:00.421 --> 47:03.340
With the whole damn family too.

47:03.549 --> 47:06.635
All due to
a crappy American invention.

47:06.803 --> 47:09.137
Santa Claus wears red and white...

47:09.305 --> 47:11.807
Because he was
a Coca-Cola mascot.

47:11.974 --> 47:14.643
I'll be bored shitless
in Monte Carlo.

47:14.811 --> 47:16.937
Monte Carlo's nothing.

47:17.105 --> 47:20.148
I have to go to Brazil
to see my dad.

47:20.316 --> 47:21.942
It's a 13-hour flight.

47:22.110 --> 47:24.986
Holidays are crumbs
to keep the proles happy.

47:25.154 --> 47:29.324
If the anarchists had won,
we wouldn't work at all.

47:29.492 --> 47:31.952
Is everything all right, dear?

47:32.120 --> 47:35.247
Good. What are you doing
for Christmas?

47:36.999 --> 47:38.166
Well?

47:38.334 --> 47:40.168
She's spending it with friends.

47:40.336 --> 47:41.378
Be careful.

47:41.587 --> 47:43.672
So you need anything?

47:44.340 --> 47:46.967
Have fun. Lots of love.

47:47.135 --> 47:49.970
Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables.

48:26.007 --> 48:28.550
- Is that any way to behave?
- What?

48:28.718 --> 48:31.803
- Is that how you eat?
- You all eat in front of the TV.

48:32.138 --> 48:35.015
Not from the pot.
It's disgusting!

48:35.683 --> 48:39.311
It's true what they say.
Iranians have no manners.

48:39.896 --> 48:43.231
Is it true that all nuns
were prostitutes first?

48:45.234 --> 48:48.111
That marked the start
of a series of moves...

48:48.279 --> 48:50.572
...from apartment to apartment.

48:50.740 --> 48:53.366
First, Eve and her mother
took me in.

48:53.534 --> 48:56.036
Then I lived with 8 homosexuals.

48:56.204 --> 48:58.622
Then in a maid's room
on Floriangasse.

48:58.789 --> 49:01.333
Then with friends.
And friends' friends.

49:01.501 --> 49:05.253
I ended up at the home
of Frau Doktor Schloss.

49:05.588 --> 49:08.882
She was
a retired philosophy teacher.

49:09.091 --> 49:11.259
To be honest, she was crazy.

49:15.264 --> 49:17.974
The rent is 2,000 schillings.

49:18.142 --> 49:20.060
You like dogs, don't you?

49:20.228 --> 49:22.062
Yes, I love them.

49:23.689 --> 49:25.273
Yuki has adopted you.

49:25.775 --> 49:27.776
Dogs have a sixth sense.

49:27.944 --> 49:30.737
They can tell if people are kind.

49:34.116 --> 49:37.911
Over the next year,
I decided to fit in for real.

49:38.079 --> 49:42.040
Certain aspects of Western culture
remained a mystery.

49:43.709 --> 49:45.460
I had to educate myself.

49:45.628 --> 49:48.505
From Sartre to Bakunin
to Zweig and Freud...

49:48.714 --> 49:50.423
...I read all I could.

49:50.967 --> 49:52.968
But I realized...

49:53.135 --> 49:55.303
...there were things
I'd never understand.

49:58.641 --> 50:01.977
Vienna 1986

50:02.728 --> 50:04.980
That bastard Waldheim got elected.

50:05.147 --> 50:07.482
- Yeah, it's crazy.
- Sickening.

50:07.650 --> 50:09.484
- I want to puke.
- It can't happen.

50:09.652 --> 50:11.653
There's a big protest tomorrow.

50:11.821 --> 50:13.905
That's all hot air anyway.

50:14.073 --> 50:17.450
Life is a void.
When man realizes that...

50:17.618 --> 50:20.495
...he can no longer live,
so he invents power games.

50:20.663 --> 50:23.707
Bullshit! Life isn't absurd!

50:23.874 --> 50:27.168
Some people
give their lives for freedom.

50:27.753 --> 50:29.963
You think my uncle died for fun?

50:30.548 --> 50:32.549
Egotistical prick.

50:35.636 --> 50:37.971
I was very confused.

50:38.848 --> 50:40.849
I had a safe, frivolous life...

50:41.017 --> 50:44.853
...while those I loved
knew the hell of war.

50:45.021 --> 50:48.773
However hard I tried,
I was haunted by guilt.

50:51.319 --> 50:55.322
I just wanted to live
like a girl my age.

50:55.489 --> 50:57.657
A big change was coming.

50:57.825 --> 51:00.744
In a few months,
I became a young lady.

51:00.911 --> 51:03.830
It was a time
of constantly renewed ugliness.

51:04.290 --> 51:07.125
First, I grew seven inches.

51:07.293 --> 51:09.544
Then my face became longer...

51:09.712 --> 51:12.631
...my right eye grew, then my chin.

51:12.798 --> 51:14.799
My right hand became huge...

51:14.967 --> 51:16.426
...then my left foot.

51:17.553 --> 51:21.139
My nose tripled in size.
My chest developed.

51:21.307 --> 51:24.434
My butt then restored
my center of gravity.

51:24.602 --> 51:28.855
To cap it all off, a huge beauty mark
decorated my nose.

51:39.575 --> 51:44.037
See, Yuki, I told you.
She's a prostitute.

51:47.458 --> 51:49.542
This music sucks.

51:49.710 --> 51:52.337
In any case, they're all losers here.

51:52.588 --> 51:56.925
Bakunin wanted bourgeois democrats
to adopt socialist resolutions.

51:58.094 --> 52:01.763
Things could have changed.
Capitalism undermines us.

52:01.931 --> 52:03.348
See what I mean?

52:03.516 --> 52:08.019
You're right. Where are you from?
Marie-Jeanne, right?

52:08.354 --> 52:11.564
Yeah, I'm from... I'm French.

52:11.732 --> 52:13.942
I'd never have guessed.

52:14.110 --> 52:15.735
I was in Paris. Know it?

52:15.903 --> 52:18.113
Sorry, I need to go see my friends.

52:18.406 --> 52:20.448
Okay, fine. See you.

52:38.467 --> 52:40.802
So you're French now?

52:40.970 --> 52:42.679
Grandma, stop it.

52:43.013 --> 52:45.140
I'm just asking.

52:45.307 --> 52:47.809
I didn't know you were French.

52:48.018 --> 52:50.812
Do you think
it is easy being Iranian here?

52:50.980 --> 52:53.690
If I say I am,
they treat me like a savage.

52:53.899 --> 52:57.527
They think we're all violent,
bloodthirsty fanatics.

52:58.112 --> 53:00.780
Is that any reason
to deny your roots?

53:04.827 --> 53:07.787
You remember what I told you?

53:07.955 --> 53:10.665
Be true to yourself.

53:17.840 --> 53:20.759
Know what she told my brother?

53:20.926 --> 53:23.303
- She said she was French.
- No.

53:23.471 --> 53:25.346
- I swear.
- And he believed her?

53:25.514 --> 53:28.641
Have you seen her?
Who'd believe she's French?

53:30.644 --> 53:32.187
Was he hitting on her?

53:32.354 --> 53:36.316
Are you crazy? I'd kill myself
if he went out with...

53:36.484 --> 53:38.193
Shut up, you bitches!

53:38.360 --> 53:41.571
Yes, I'm Iranian
and, yes, I'm proud of it!

53:44.158 --> 53:47.577
After three years in Austria,
I felt good at last.

53:47.745 --> 53:51.664
Momo, Thierry,
Eve and Olivier had left.

53:51.832 --> 53:53.958
I had new friends.

53:54.835 --> 53:58.546
Birgit was a hippie
who looked like an old child.

54:00.382 --> 54:02.342
At her house in the forest...

54:02.510 --> 54:04.886
...she threw anarchist parties.

54:05.054 --> 54:09.057
The state had nothing to fear
because these anarchists...

54:09.225 --> 54:12.602
...mainly drank beer
and ate sausages.

54:14.355 --> 54:17.232
At one of these parties,
I met Fernando.

54:17.399 --> 54:21.069
When I saw him,
I knew he was the man of my life.

54:50.432 --> 54:52.392
Marjane, are you there?

54:54.270 --> 54:56.771
Last night, thanks to you,
I finally understood.

54:57.273 --> 54:59.941
You've helped me discover myself.

55:00.901 --> 55:04.112
If it didn't work with you,
it won't with any girl.

55:04.280 --> 55:07.407
I know now: I'm homosexual.

55:09.201 --> 55:11.619
It's so good to say it.

55:12.454 --> 55:14.873
Thank you, Marjane.

55:15.040 --> 55:16.833
You're welcome.

55:19.086 --> 55:22.297
After that pathetic setback,
I swore off love.

55:22.464 --> 55:24.048
I swear off love.

55:24.884 --> 55:27.385
Love is a petty bourgeois emotion.

55:28.470 --> 55:32.140
But "life is life,"
as some losers used to sing.

55:32.349 --> 55:36.978
And, one November morning,
Markus came into my life.

55:49.950 --> 55:51.492
Want a ride home?

56:10.387 --> 56:12.221
I had finally found love.

56:12.389 --> 56:15.725
Nothing scared me
and the future seemed bright.

56:16.352 --> 56:19.354
Markus was going to be
a great writer.

56:21.023 --> 56:24.651
He'd read extracts of his play
to me in his room.

56:36.997 --> 56:39.374
We were one.

57:01.063 --> 57:02.730
I got croissants, baby!

57:06.235 --> 57:08.903
Wait, I can explain.
It's not what you think.

57:10.948 --> 57:13.408
Marjane, I love you!

57:13.951 --> 57:16.244
I love you!

57:21.000 --> 57:22.875
I can't find my brooch.

57:23.043 --> 57:25.545
I'm sure you've stolen it.

57:25.963 --> 57:27.588
Not now. Leave me be.

57:27.756 --> 57:30.091
No! You won't get away with it...

57:30.259 --> 57:31.718
...you thief!

57:31.885 --> 57:34.053
Go to hell! I detest you!

57:34.221 --> 57:37.181
You and your shitty dog!

57:38.892 --> 57:42.103
How dare you say that about Yuki?
Where are you going?

57:42.980 --> 57:44.397
You won't get away!

57:44.565 --> 57:46.607
Go fuck yourself!

57:46.775 --> 57:49.402
You thief! Give me my brooch back!

57:49.570 --> 57:51.029
I'll call the police!

57:51.196 --> 57:53.114
Come back!

57:56.535 --> 57:58.411
What an idiot.

57:58.579 --> 58:00.788
That bastard fooled me.

58:01.707 --> 58:04.208
I'm an idiot.

58:04.376 --> 58:08.254
How did I fall in love
with that pathetic, stingy prick?

58:08.422 --> 58:10.381
- Want a ride home?
- Okay.

58:10.549 --> 58:13.926
I need to get gas.
Shall we split it?

58:15.637 --> 58:17.638
And his breath smelled like shit!

58:17.806 --> 58:20.224
The jerk had a lousy personality.

58:22.227 --> 58:25.396
Damn! Are you crazy?
My eye hurts!

58:25.564 --> 58:27.940
- Let me see, honey.
- It's okay!

58:28.108 --> 58:30.234
Pretentious loser. Writer, my ass!

58:30.402 --> 58:32.945
His rotten play
was a piece of shit.

58:35.908 --> 58:37.992
And he didn't have any balls.

58:38.160 --> 58:41.120
He didn't stand up
to his mom for me.

58:46.668 --> 58:48.669
A real wimp.

58:48.837 --> 58:51.172
I always bought our hash too.

58:51.340 --> 58:54.342
That coward stayed in the car
waiting for me!

58:54.510 --> 58:56.969
He didn't care if I got arrested.

58:59.348 --> 59:02.850
What an idiot I was.
What an idiot...

59:11.819 --> 59:14.278
That was my first night
on the street.

59:14.446 --> 59:16.364
There were plenty more.

01:01:31.833 --> 01:01:35.544
A revolution had carried off
part of my family.

01:01:35.712 --> 01:01:37.797
I had survived a war...

01:01:38.632 --> 01:01:41.509
...but a banal love story
nearly killed me.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.388
Are you okay?

01:01:47.599 --> 01:01:49.308
Are we awake now?

01:01:50.644 --> 01:01:53.271
You had a close call.

01:01:53.438 --> 01:01:56.190
You're lucky we found you
in that cold.

01:01:56.358 --> 01:01:58.150
You have bronchitis.

01:01:58.318 --> 01:02:02.363
I forbid you to smoke
a single cigarette.

01:02:02.531 --> 01:02:04.365
- Your last name?
- Satrapi.

01:02:04.533 --> 01:02:06.659
- First name?
- Marjane.

01:02:07.869 --> 01:02:09.996
- Where do you live?
- In Iran.

01:02:10.163 --> 01:02:12.039
In Iran?

01:02:12.541 --> 01:02:14.166
Can I make a phone call?

01:02:15.043 --> 01:02:16.877
- Hello?
- Dad?

01:02:17.045 --> 01:02:19.297
Marjane? Is that you?

01:02:19.464 --> 01:02:22.550
We were so worried.
No news in two months!

01:02:22.718 --> 01:02:25.344
Dad, can I come home?

01:02:25.512 --> 01:02:26.929
Of course.

01:02:27.097 --> 01:02:29.098
Promise me, no questions.

01:02:29.266 --> 01:02:30.891
I promise.

01:02:31.601 --> 01:02:33.352
Here's your mother.

01:02:34.062 --> 01:02:35.271
Marjane?

01:02:36.148 --> 01:02:37.648
Mom, don't cry, please.

01:02:37.816 --> 01:02:40.484
Come home, we're waiting for you.

01:02:40.652 --> 01:02:43.571
- Mom...
- No one will ask you anything.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.406
We promise.

01:02:54.583 --> 01:02:56.667
Any forbidden goods, sister?

01:02:56.835 --> 01:02:59.253
Pork, alcohol, playing cards, music...

01:02:59.421 --> 01:03:01.630
...films, fashion, porn?

01:03:01.798 --> 01:03:03.549
No, sir.

01:03:04.176 --> 01:03:05.593
Fix your veil.

01:03:06.178 --> 01:03:07.678
Yes, sir.

01:03:08.263 --> 01:03:10.264
You may go.

01:03:18.774 --> 01:03:21.817
Look! It's Marji!
My little girl...

01:03:21.985 --> 01:03:23.444
I didn't recognize you.

01:03:23.612 --> 01:03:25.279
- You're here.
- You've grown.

01:03:25.447 --> 01:03:27.406
You're here.

01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:40.628
The next day, I saw the mountains.
It had snowed.

01:03:40.796 --> 01:03:44.757
My father wondered if he needed
snow chains to go to work.

01:03:45.425 --> 01:03:49.303
We had breakfast together
as we used to.

01:03:49.763 --> 01:03:52.932
My mother made me
my favorite omelet.

01:03:53.308 --> 01:03:56.227
Nothing had changed
but, deep down, I knew...

01:03:56.395 --> 01:03:58.396
...nothing would be like before.

01:03:58.563 --> 01:04:00.981
We talked about this and that.

01:04:01.233 --> 01:04:04.985
They respected my wishes
and asked nothing about Vienna.

01:04:05.153 --> 01:04:09.990
I was anxious but also believed
that the nightmare was behind us.

01:04:11.076 --> 01:04:14.745
The future could be brighter
now that the war was over.

01:04:14.913 --> 01:04:17.540
The war is over. That's true.

01:04:17.707 --> 01:04:19.500
But now it's almost worse.

01:04:19.668 --> 01:04:22.503
People don't know
why we had a war.

01:04:22.671 --> 01:04:25.464
Let her breathe.
She just got back.

01:04:25.632 --> 01:04:27.842
It's all right, Mom.

01:04:31.012 --> 01:04:33.139
The West sold weapons
to both sides...

01:04:33.306 --> 01:04:37.184
...and we stupidly played
their cynical game.

01:04:37.769 --> 01:04:39.895
Eight years of war for nothing.

01:04:40.439 --> 01:04:43.023
A million dead for nothing.

01:04:44.151 --> 01:04:47.403
The last days were terrible.

01:04:47.571 --> 01:04:52.408
One month before the armistice,
Iraq bombed Tehran every day...

01:04:53.702 --> 01:04:56.328
...as if to wipe it off the map.

01:04:56.496 --> 01:04:59.331
Towards the end,
the regime got scared...

01:04:59.499 --> 01:05:03.836
...because an opposition army
had entered from Iraq.

01:05:04.004 --> 01:05:08.674
The government feared the threat
posed by political prisoners.

01:05:08.842 --> 01:05:12.928
The state adopted
a radical solution to the problem.

01:05:13.096 --> 01:05:15.306
It gave the prisoners a choice.

01:05:15.474 --> 01:05:17.558
Either they give up their ideas...

01:05:17.726 --> 01:05:20.561
...swear loyalty to the regime...

01:05:20.729 --> 01:05:23.147
...and do their time...

01:05:23.315 --> 01:05:25.441
...or they would be executed.

01:05:29.237 --> 01:05:32.406
The majority of them were executed.

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:46.420
Now they name streets
after the war martyrs.

01:05:46.588 --> 01:05:50.090
That's all the families have left:
street names.

01:05:52.219 --> 01:05:57.473
Walking in Tehran now is like
walking through a cemetery.

01:06:14.783 --> 01:06:16.450
Lord, you've grown!

01:06:16.618 --> 01:06:19.078
You'll grab God's balls soon!

01:06:19.246 --> 01:06:21.121
Grandma!

01:06:21.957 --> 01:06:25.626
So tell me everything.
How was Vienna?

01:06:25.794 --> 01:06:28.379
Well, it was different...

01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:33.217
- Remember Mina?
- Sure, she's my cousin.

01:06:33.385 --> 01:06:36.053
She's married, with two kids.

01:06:37.097 --> 01:06:38.472
As dumb as ever.

01:06:39.015 --> 01:06:40.474
You remember Shila?

01:06:40.642 --> 01:06:42.434
- Yes.
- She's an ugly cow.

01:06:43.019 --> 01:06:46.647
Her face is so hairy.
She's like a gorilla.

01:06:46.815 --> 01:06:48.482
And you remember Modjeh?

01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:50.568
I remember everyone.

01:06:50.735 --> 01:06:53.487
She got divorced.
Apparently, he had a tiny dick.

01:06:53.655 --> 01:06:55.531
Or so Shari says.

01:06:55.699 --> 01:06:57.908
Well, she told Mehri who told me.

01:06:59.452 --> 01:07:01.161
You'll see them soon.

01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:04.290
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

01:07:10.672 --> 01:07:13.007
You must speak good German now.

01:07:13.174 --> 01:07:14.425
Yes, a little.

01:07:14.593 --> 01:07:17.052
I can say, "Ich liebe dich."

01:07:17.846 --> 01:07:22.516
Vienna reminds me of Empress Sissi.
Did you meet Romy Schneider?

01:07:23.852 --> 01:07:26.645
Marjane, stars shine in the sky...

01:07:26.813 --> 01:07:28.355
...and you shine in my heart.

01:07:30.025 --> 01:07:33.652
You look like a nun.
Who'd guess you were in Europe?

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:34.862
You think so?

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:37.364
You must have loads to tell us.

01:07:37.532 --> 01:07:38.949
Not really.

01:07:39.492 --> 01:07:42.119
How were the Vienna nightclubs?

01:07:42.287 --> 01:07:46.206
I didn't really go to nightclubs.
I don't like them.

01:07:46.374 --> 01:07:47.374
What?

01:07:47.584 --> 01:07:50.169
- Ever slept with a guy?
- Yes.

01:07:50.337 --> 01:07:52.463
- Is it good?
- It depends on the guy.

01:07:52.631 --> 01:07:55.507
What? You've slept
with more than one?

01:07:55.717 --> 01:07:57.718
Enroll in a prep class.

01:07:57.886 --> 01:07:59.386
Get your nose fixed.

01:07:59.554 --> 01:08:02.056
- Be an astronaut.
- Dress better.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:23.077
It's 90 degrees out there!
I'm sick of this thing!

01:08:23.243 --> 01:08:24.536
Damn hairdresser...

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.247
...you're unworthy of my son.

01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:29.917
Hello, Anahita.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.587
Marjane just went out.

01:08:33.755 --> 01:08:35.255
Okay, I'll tell her.

01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:36.881
Goodbye.

01:08:37.425 --> 01:08:39.843
You can't watch TV all day long.

01:08:40.011 --> 01:08:42.388
Didn't you want to take that exam?

01:08:44.683 --> 01:08:47.893
You're wasting
the best years of your life.

01:08:48.228 --> 01:08:50.729
See people. Get a change of scenery.

01:08:50.897 --> 01:08:52.106
They all piss me off.

01:08:52.273 --> 01:08:54.358
There must be someone you like.

01:08:54.526 --> 01:08:57.444
Just one among the 7 million here!

01:08:58.988 --> 01:09:02.448
Yes, there was Kia,
an old childhood friend.

01:09:03.535 --> 01:09:06.412
When I saw him,
I understood Grandma's words.

01:09:06.578 --> 01:09:07.955
He's nearly dead.

01:09:08.163 --> 01:09:09.957
Kia had been to war.

01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:13.127
He'd lost an arm and a leg.

01:09:13.294 --> 01:09:15.421
I had fun with him.

01:09:15.796 --> 01:09:19.758
We even laughed. I realized
my problems weren't that bad.

01:09:21.094 --> 01:09:25.639
His whole life is ruined
but he can still laugh.

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.269
I suppose that's the only way
to deal with it.

01:09:31.813 --> 01:09:34.939
I keep telling myself that,
but I can't do it.

01:09:35.316 --> 01:09:37.024
It's unbearable.

01:09:37.193 --> 01:09:40.404
My life weighs down on me,
but who can I talk to?

01:09:40.572 --> 01:09:42.238
You understand?

01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:45.617
Everyone around me has suffered.

01:09:45.785 --> 01:09:49.997
I was a stranger in Austria
and now I'm one in my own country.

01:09:50.707 --> 01:09:55.419
Your condition has a name.
Depression.

01:09:56.254 --> 01:09:58.422
Effective treatment exists.

01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:01.008
I'll give you some pills.

01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:18.150
Sure you won't come with us?

01:10:19.235 --> 01:10:20.611
The sea air will help.

01:10:20.779 --> 01:10:24.448
No, I want to be alone.
Don't worry.

01:11:54.038 --> 01:11:56.081
Why are you here, my dear?

01:11:56.708 --> 01:11:58.250
Well, I'm dead.

01:11:58.418 --> 01:12:01.211
Don't you know
your time hasn't come?

01:12:01.713 --> 01:12:05.465
- It hasn't?
- You have to pull yourself together.

01:12:05.633 --> 01:12:07.634
Yes! He's right for once!

01:12:08.261 --> 01:12:10.721
You have a lot to do. Get moving!

01:12:14.976 --> 01:12:17.477
Go and do what you have to do.

01:12:20.565 --> 01:12:23.483
Remember,
the struggle continues! Right?

01:12:23.651 --> 01:12:25.986
Yeah, the struggle continues.

01:13:33.805 --> 01:13:37.099
Tehran 1992

01:13:41.396 --> 01:13:43.522
- I'm starving.
- Haven't you eaten?

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:45.524
The idiot's on a diet.

01:13:45.692 --> 01:13:47.025
You're crazy.

01:13:47.193 --> 01:13:48.986
She got a copy of Vogue.

01:13:49.654 --> 01:13:52.489
She reads it all the time.

01:13:55.243 --> 01:13:57.327
You've caught his eye.

01:13:57.495 --> 01:13:58.870
You're embarrassing me.

01:13:59.706 --> 01:14:02.416
We'll now talk about Botticelli...

01:14:02.583 --> 01:14:05.585
...and, in particular,
The Birth of Venus.

01:14:06.212 --> 01:14:09.881
We could also call this painting
Spring...

01:14:10.049 --> 01:14:13.677
...like Botticelli's other allegory
in the Uffizi Gallery.

01:14:13.845 --> 01:14:15.053
In this painting...

01:14:15.221 --> 01:14:16.763
You there!

01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:18.765
What's so funny?

01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:25.105
Want to bet I'll take my veil off?

01:14:25.273 --> 01:14:27.441
- Sure.
- Come on, how much?

01:14:27.608 --> 01:14:28.942
Four hundred tomans.

01:14:29.861 --> 01:14:31.236
Go on.

01:14:41.456 --> 01:14:45.625
In the early 1990s,
the age of great ideals was over.

01:14:45.793 --> 01:14:50.881
After the Revolution,
so many students were imprisoned...

01:14:51.049 --> 01:14:53.091
...we didn't dare discuss politics.

01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:56.720
The war was behind us at last.

01:14:56.888 --> 01:15:01.016
We were so eager for happiness,
we forgot we weren't free.

01:16:01.577 --> 01:16:04.037
- Is that any way to dress?
- You hear me?

01:16:04.205 --> 01:16:05.247
Beat it!

01:16:13.798 --> 01:16:16.758
- Grandma, you're here?
- Yes, I came to see you.

01:16:19.137 --> 01:16:21.847
You're all dolled up!

01:16:22.557 --> 01:16:24.141
Are you in love?

01:16:24.308 --> 01:16:26.643
Yes, I was meeting him earlier.

01:16:26.811 --> 01:16:30.272
The Guardians turned up.
I had a close call.

01:16:31.357 --> 01:16:32.816
Look how I'm made up!

01:16:33.276 --> 01:16:34.818
I didn't know what to do.

01:16:34.986 --> 01:16:37.362
But a guy was staring at me.

01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:41.825
My only solution was to play
the poor, defenseless girl.

01:16:42.577 --> 01:16:44.911
- Brother...
- Yes, sister.

01:16:45.079 --> 01:16:47.038
A man just insulted me.

01:16:47.206 --> 01:16:50.250
Where is the bastard?
We'll shut him up.

01:16:50.418 --> 01:16:53.044
That's him on the steps there!

01:16:53.212 --> 01:16:54.838
Shame on you.

01:16:55.006 --> 01:16:58.508
Got a mother? A sister?
What if someone insulted them?

01:17:00.845 --> 01:17:05.015
I didn't do anything!
I swear, on my mother's life!

01:17:05.183 --> 01:17:08.393
- What did they do to him?
- They arrested him.

01:17:08.561 --> 01:17:11.354
- You find that funny?
- Yes, don't you?

01:17:11.522 --> 01:17:15.400
You're a selfish bitch,
that's what I think!

01:17:19.989 --> 01:17:21.656
Grandma, I had no choice.

01:17:21.824 --> 01:17:25.368
You had a choice!
Everyone has a choice!

01:17:25.536 --> 01:17:28.038
Everyone always has a choice!

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:33.877
Your grandfather spent years in jail
for defending the innocent.

01:17:34.295 --> 01:17:36.338
And your Uncle Anoush!

01:17:36.505 --> 01:17:38.798
Have you forgotten why he died?

01:17:39.967 --> 01:17:41.801
What have I taught you?

01:17:42.428 --> 01:17:44.304
Integrity!

01:17:45.181 --> 01:17:48.308
Does that word
mean anything to you?

01:17:51.103 --> 01:17:52.395
Shame on you!

01:18:00.404 --> 01:18:03.573
The lady with the shoulder bag,
stop running.

01:18:03.866 --> 01:18:06.993
The lady with the bag,
stop running!

01:18:07.161 --> 01:18:08.828
Hey, you, don't run!

01:18:12.792 --> 01:18:14.459
Why are you running?

01:18:14.627 --> 01:18:16.419
I'm late for my class!

01:18:16.587 --> 01:18:18.672
Maybe, but you mustn't run.

01:18:19.298 --> 01:18:23.468
When you run, your behind
moves in an obscene way.

01:18:24.178 --> 01:18:26.221
So don't look at my ass!

01:18:41.612 --> 01:18:44.906
This is crazy.
It's the same from every angle.

01:18:45.199 --> 01:18:48.576
An anatomy class?
All you can see is her big nose.

01:18:48.744 --> 01:18:50.287
You must all go...

01:18:50.663 --> 01:18:52.914
...to the main campus immediately.

01:18:53.249 --> 01:18:56.251
All absentees will be barred
for two weeks.

01:19:00.256 --> 01:19:02.757
We simply cannot behave badly.

01:19:02.925 --> 01:19:05.802
Our martyrs' blood
nourished our revolution.

01:19:05.970 --> 01:19:10.682
Indecent behavior scorns those
who gave their lives for us.

01:19:10.891 --> 01:19:13.560
And so I'd like
the young ladies here...

01:19:13.728 --> 01:19:17.063
...to wear narrower trousers
and longer headscarves.

01:19:17.231 --> 01:19:20.900
They should cover their hair
and not use make-up.

01:19:21.068 --> 01:19:22.694
Any questions?

01:19:22.862 --> 01:19:24.529
If not, the meeting is over.

01:19:24.697 --> 01:19:25.822
Yes?

01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:29.117
You talk about our scarves
and trousers...

01:19:29.285 --> 01:19:31.411
...you say we use makeup, etc.

01:19:31.579 --> 01:19:34.622
As an art student,
I'm often in the studio.

01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:37.417
I need to move freely
in order to draw.

01:19:37.585 --> 01:19:40.754
A longer scarf would hinder me.

01:19:40.921 --> 01:19:45.842
You say our trousers are too wide
even though they hide our shape.

01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:48.303
Since these trousers
are the fashion right now...

01:19:48.471 --> 01:19:51.890
...is religion
defending our integrity...

01:19:52.058 --> 01:19:54.434
...or is it opposed to fashion?

01:19:55.102 --> 01:19:57.854
You criticize us,
yet our brothers here...

01:19:58.022 --> 01:20:00.273
...have different hair and clothes.

01:20:00.441 --> 01:20:03.902
Sometimes we can even make out
their underwear.

01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:06.363
Why, as a woman...

01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:09.699
...should their tight clothes
have no effect on me...

01:20:09.867 --> 01:20:12.619
...while a shorter headscarf
arouses them?

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:20.168
Good girl. That's like chopping
their tiny dicks off.

01:20:21.337 --> 01:20:25.423
Take that hood off.
It makes me claustrophobic.

01:20:25.591 --> 01:20:27.801
I forget I'm wearing it.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.346
Never forget that.

01:20:31.514 --> 01:20:35.058
Fear lulls our minds to sleep.

01:20:35.267 --> 01:20:37.977
It turns us into cowards as well.

01:20:38.604 --> 01:20:42.023
You showed guts. I'm proud of you.

01:20:45.569 --> 01:20:47.153
- I want to leave.
- To go where?

01:20:47.321 --> 01:20:49.697
Who cares. The USA or Europe.

01:20:49.865 --> 01:20:51.282
Where in Europe?

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:53.284
Anywhere. I'm sick of Iran.

01:20:53.786 --> 01:20:56.079
- What about us?
- You'll come too.

01:20:56.247 --> 01:20:58.498
I don't want to leave.

01:20:58.791 --> 01:21:00.708
You're still nostalgic.

01:21:00.876 --> 01:21:03.586
You'll soon be sick
of people's meddling.

01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:07.173
Maybe, but in the West nobody cares
if you die on the street.

01:21:08.342 --> 01:21:10.135
Don't worry.

01:21:11.178 --> 01:21:12.846
We'll manage somehow.

01:21:18.853 --> 01:21:21.521
What's your relationship
with this man?

01:21:22.815 --> 01:21:24.149
You know what happens now.

01:21:24.316 --> 01:21:27.944
We call your parents.
They pay a fine or you get whipped.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:42.500
When your mother and I were 15,
we'd walk hand in hand.

01:21:45.045 --> 01:21:47.338
It was in this same country.

01:21:50.801 --> 01:21:55.305
This is the way things are now,
my daughter.

01:21:55.556 --> 01:21:58.016
You must be careful from now on.

01:21:58.184 --> 01:22:01.686
You should avoid
being together in public.

01:22:13.407 --> 01:22:15.909
It's impossible.
We can't go anywhere.

01:22:16.076 --> 01:22:19.537
We're like prisoners.
What kind of life is this?

01:22:19.705 --> 01:22:20.747
Yeah.

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.166
We should get married.

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:25.919
Well?

01:22:50.736 --> 01:22:52.820
- Have you been crying, Mom?
- No.

01:22:56.450 --> 01:23:00.453
I wanted you to be independent,
educated, cultured.

01:23:00.621 --> 01:23:02.664
Now you're marrying at 21!

01:23:03.374 --> 01:23:07.293
I want you to leave Iran,
to be free and emancipated!

01:23:07.545 --> 01:23:11.381
Mom, trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

01:23:11.549 --> 01:23:14.509
One year later

01:23:22.685 --> 01:23:24.477
- Seen my car keys?
- Huh?

01:23:24.645 --> 01:23:26.479
My car keys!

01:23:26.647 --> 01:23:28.982
- I left them on the table.
- No idea.

01:23:32.486 --> 01:23:34.862
They were just there.

01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:58.595
- We share nothing.
- You're a great match.

01:23:58.762 --> 01:24:00.471
The perfect couple.

01:24:00.639 --> 01:24:02.015
Perfect, my ass!

01:24:02.683 --> 01:24:04.434
Do you want my photo?

01:24:06.437 --> 01:24:07.687
Jerk!

01:24:07.855 --> 01:24:10.857
You used to say
how much in love you were.

01:24:11.025 --> 01:24:13.901
It's easy to be in love
three hours a week.

01:24:14.069 --> 01:24:16.279
Not when you share the same home.

01:24:16.447 --> 01:24:19.324
Surely you're not getting divorced?

01:24:20.534 --> 01:24:22.035
I don't know.

01:24:22.202 --> 01:24:25.038
My sister left her husband
last year.

01:24:26.457 --> 01:24:28.791
As soon as she was divorced...

01:24:28.959 --> 01:24:31.961
...every man around
wanted to sleep with her.

01:24:32.129 --> 01:24:34.047
The butcher made advances.

01:24:34.214 --> 01:24:35.882
Then the baker too.

01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:37.383
The grocer.

01:24:37.551 --> 01:24:39.510
And even beggars!

01:24:40.304 --> 01:24:43.681
Men all think their thing
is irresistible...

01:24:43.849 --> 01:24:47.894
...and that a divorcée won't refuse
since she's not a virgin.

01:24:50.731 --> 01:24:53.024
If life isn't hell,
stay with him.

01:25:04.745 --> 01:25:06.788
What's got you in such a state?

01:25:06.955 --> 01:25:08.039
Forgive me.

01:25:08.248 --> 01:25:11.125
Of course.
But what has made you so sad?

01:25:11.627 --> 01:25:14.504
Grandma. It's terrible.

01:25:14.672 --> 01:25:16.756
What's so terrible?

01:25:16.924 --> 01:25:20.176
I don't love Reza anymore.

01:25:20.344 --> 01:25:22.679
I think we're going to separate.

01:25:24.098 --> 01:25:28.267
So that's all it is?
I thought someone had died.

01:25:28.894 --> 01:25:30.937
You're out of your mind.

01:25:31.105 --> 01:25:34.524
You do this to me,
with my weak heart!

01:25:34.692 --> 01:25:38.611
All these tears over a divorce!

01:25:43.701 --> 01:25:45.284
Listen to me.

01:25:45.619 --> 01:25:48.287
I did it 55 years ago...

01:25:48.455 --> 01:25:51.708
...and no one got divorced
back then.

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:55.712
I knew I'd be happier alone
than with some jerk.

01:25:55.879 --> 01:25:58.047
- But...
- There's no "but."

01:25:58.424 --> 01:26:01.300
The first marriage is practice
for the second.

01:26:01.468 --> 01:26:04.929
You'll be happier next time round.

01:26:10.185 --> 01:26:12.979
You're crying
because you were wrong.

01:26:13.147 --> 01:26:16.482
It's hard
admitting your mistakes, hmm?

01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:04.108
Where were you?

01:29:04.276 --> 01:29:05.943
Why didn't you call?

01:29:07.446 --> 01:29:11.032
- Nima is dead.
- What?

01:29:11.575 --> 01:29:13.784
Nima is dead.

01:29:16.997 --> 01:29:18.164
I'm leaving you.

01:29:22.502 --> 01:29:24.837
It was time for me to leave.

01:29:25.005 --> 01:29:27.298
I decided to go to France.

01:29:27.466 --> 01:29:31.093
I had to wait three months
for a visa.

01:29:32.596 --> 01:29:35.556
I went to the Caspian Sea
with my Grandma...

01:29:35.724 --> 01:29:39.018
...to fill my lungs
with its special air.

01:29:40.646 --> 01:29:43.397
An air you find nowhere else.

01:29:52.866 --> 01:29:57.370
I promised my grandfather
I'd make him proud.

01:30:03.043 --> 01:30:07.004
Finally, I went to the prison
where Uncle Anoush lay...

01:30:07.172 --> 01:30:10.341
...somewhere among thousands
of other innocents.

01:30:10.509 --> 01:30:14.220
I swore to him to remain
as honest as possible.

01:30:29.569 --> 01:30:31.654
Then came the day I left.

01:30:32.572 --> 01:30:34.782
My father cried as usual.

01:30:39.454 --> 01:30:41.747
You're going for good. You're free.

01:30:41.915 --> 01:30:43.958
Today's Iran is not for you.

01:30:44.126 --> 01:30:45.918
I forbid you to come back.

01:30:46.086 --> 01:30:47.753
Yes, Mom.

01:30:47.921 --> 01:30:51.465
- Grandma...
- My little girl.

01:31:11.445 --> 01:31:14.155
I never saw my grandmother again.

01:31:15.574 --> 01:31:17.491
She died shortly thereafter.

01:31:18.869 --> 01:31:21.120
Freedom always has a price.

01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:09.668
Terrible weather.

01:32:12.172 --> 01:32:13.798
Where are you coming from?

01:32:16.009 --> 01:32:17.384
Iran.

01:32:20.013 --> 01:32:23.599
Grandma, you smell so good.
How do you do it?

01:32:23.767 --> 01:32:26.852
I pick jasmine flowers
every morning.

01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:29.980
When I dress,
I slip them inside my bra.

01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:32.817
That way, I always smell good.

01:32:32.984 --> 01:32:35.820
Wow! That's great!
