01:31.049 --> 01:34.552
- So it's been agreed
the O'Connells will push

01:34.553 --> 01:37.769
the votes in the east, the
O'Donnells in the west.

01:37.770 --> 01:40.266
I would like to introduce
Jimmy to the table.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.646
He's just been released after
six months in the maze itself

01:43.647 --> 01:46.364
and he's been working in
England for us ever since.

01:46.365 --> 01:47.773
- Thank you, Jerry.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.118
There's no need for
any introductions.

01:50.119 --> 01:53.696
Basically...
- I know who you are.

01:53.697 --> 01:54.947
- Excuse me?

01:54.948 --> 01:56.200
- You're the one who
handled a close friend

01:56.201 --> 01:59.328
of ours, Connor, let's
say pretty poorly.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.090
- Connor?

02:04.091 --> 02:06.375
- Connor McGovern.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.298
He used to sit in that chair
you're sitting in, aye,

02:09.299 --> 02:10.923
always pushing out
the same bullshit

02:10.924 --> 02:12.970
that I don't care to listen to.

02:12.971 --> 02:16.391
The difference is he's
loyal and familiar.

02:19.181 --> 02:23.225
When you was inside,
you beat him,

02:23.226 --> 02:24.727
you beat him like a dog.

02:24.728 --> 02:25.820
- Patrick, I think
you got the wrong idea.

02:25.821 --> 02:27.610
- Quiet.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.735
He can talk for himself.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.496
What have you got
to say for yourself?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.539
- I'm sorry but he had it...

02:45.540 --> 02:47.087
- You find it funny?

02:48.460 --> 02:51.885
Well, why don't you
try doing that again?

02:59.471 --> 03:02.473
What have you got
to say for yourself?

03:02.474 --> 03:04.600
- I'm sorry for what
I did but he made

03:04.601 --> 03:06.148
an attempt on my
business on the inside.

03:06.149 --> 03:09.146
- His business is my business.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.570
And stand when you talk to me.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.318
Stand!

03:28.375 --> 03:30.093
- Charlie!

03:40.387 --> 03:42.226
- Now listen to me,
Well, I need you

03:42.227 --> 03:43.723
to get under the bed for daddy.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.189
Come on, Michael,
get down there son.

03:46.190 --> 03:48.102
Get down, don't be scared son.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.354
Look after your brother, Well,
just look after your brother,

03:50.355 --> 03:51.731
and do not come
from under this bed.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.815
Do you hear me?

04:35.400 --> 04:36.492
- No, Michael!

05:01.551 --> 05:03.144
- He's just a child!

06:18.879 --> 06:21.130
- That's interesting.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.674
- Sorry?

06:23.675 --> 06:26.474
- The sculpture,
it's interesting.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.980
- How do you find
it interesting?

06:34.352 --> 06:38.314
- Is this how you
diagnose your patients?

06:38.315 --> 06:39.904
Depending on their
answer you know

06:39.905 --> 06:41.368
if they're suicidal or not.

06:41.369 --> 06:43.487
- Are you feeling suicidal?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.488
- <i>No.</i>

06:46.489 --> 06:47.661
Not now anyway.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.998
So why did you chose
that sculpture?

06:55.999 --> 06:57.666
- It was a gift.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.793
' A gift?

06:59.794 --> 07:00.961
From who?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.509
- A patient.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.176
- Are you allowed to
accept gifts from patients?

07:07.177 --> 07:10.101
- Not really but I
thought it was compelling

07:10.102 --> 07:12.770
so I accepted it
and there it is.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.059
- Here it is.

07:25.654 --> 07:29.198
- It is
Hercules fighting off evil

07:29.199 --> 07:33.124
which can be seen as
anything, fear, depression,

07:34.746 --> 07:37.750
anger, and it
showcases his strength.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.089
- Does that mean I'm evil?

07:45.090 --> 07:46.382
- <i>No.</i>

07:46.383 --> 07:48.886
No. that's not what I'm saying.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.152
- I should get going.

08:01.153 --> 08:06.404
- Before you leave, take this.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.198
- A journal.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.449
Why?

08:12.450 --> 08:15.786
- Let's just call it
a form of practice.

08:15.787 --> 08:19.248
Write down your thoughts,
draw them, I don't care.

08:19.249 --> 08:23.168
Just do something
before our next session.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.795
- I don't know.

08:24.796 --> 08:25.796
- Just try.

08:28.842 --> 08:29.842
Please.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.398
- Beautiful.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.609
- Stanley.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.362
Must you always do that?

10:55.363 --> 10:56.785
- Sorry.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.907
- Now, look at this.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.704
- Oh, here you go.

11:00.705 --> 11:01.919
- Thank you son.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.504
- Come on, stand up.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.125
- I'm getting old.

11:08.126 --> 11:12.379
I can't even stand up without
getting out of breath.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.220
- You're not old.

11:13.221 --> 11:14.221
- Oh, you.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.426
- Go on, play us a tune.

11:17.427 --> 11:21.305
- Ooh, I couldn't
now, I'm too winded.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.182
Tell me about your day.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.475
- Nothing special.

11:25.476 --> 11:28.520
Went for a ski and
then did the food shop.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.525
- You've been up that foolish
mountain again, haven't you?

11:31.526 --> 11:32.741
Just like your father.

11:32.742 --> 11:35.235
- I do it every
morning, it's fine.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.115
- Ves, and one of these
days you'll take a fall,

11:38.116 --> 11:41.617
flying down there
like a lunatic.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.712
Off-piste is so dangerous.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.466
Why can't you ski in the
resort like everyone else?

11:48.467 --> 11:50.256
You might meet someone.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.675
Away from England
all these years

11:53.676 --> 11:55.172
and you still have
no friends here.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.847
- I have no friends because
this is the life I've chosen.

11:57.848 --> 11:59.051
- Okay.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.302
It's all right,
Stanley, it's fine.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.303
- Is it?

12:06.517 --> 12:08.690
- What's on your mind, son?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.314
- Nothing.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.783
- Tell me what's
troubling you, Stanley.

12:13.784 --> 12:16.985
I don't want you
getting all upset again.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.112
- I just feel.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.625
No, forget it.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.665
I'll go and prepare the dinner.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.390
- Where's Rueben?

12:46.391 --> 12:48.860
- He's over there, but I
wouldn't interrupt them.

12:48.861 --> 12:50.444
He is in a bad mood.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.357
- Yeah, so am I.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.317
- What would you rather do?

12:57.318 --> 12:59.867
Talk things through
like men or be a child

12:59.868 --> 13:02.948
and put innocent
people in harm's way?

13:02.949 --> 13:05.202
Have we not all lost enough?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.415
We all know what it feels like

13:08.416 --> 13:11.508
to lose something we care
about, or someone we love.

13:11.509 --> 13:14.751
It's how we handle
that and keep going.

13:14.752 --> 13:18.797
If not for ourselves, then
at least for our families.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.927
My friends, the era
of the gun is over.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.481
- Get us another drink, will ya?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.147
Well.

13:30.148 --> 13:31.768
- Logan, not now.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.438
- Why can't I say
hello to a friend?

13:34.439 --> 13:36.648
- Hardly a friend.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.196
- What I'd do to fuck you.

13:38.197 --> 13:40.152
- Oh, fuck off Logan.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.654
- Hey, what you doing here?

13:42.655 --> 13:43.702
- Here to see Rueben.

13:43.703 --> 13:45.073
- Rueben.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.074
What'd you want with him for?

13:46.075 --> 13:46.997
- Not for you to know.

13:46.998 --> 13:48.577
- No?

13:48.578 --> 13:50.672
Why is that, am I not
worthy of such information?

13:50.673 --> 13:54.833
- Ethan, will you just
leave it be please?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.126
- Why?

13:56.127 --> 13:59.381
I thought we told
each other everything.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.224
- Yes, that's not right.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.598
- Am I not making sense to you?

14:09.599 --> 14:10.682
Any of yous?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.777
- Rueben, we need to talk.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.530
- Calm down Well,
we'll talk in a bit.

14:15.531 --> 14:17.865
- I think we should talk now.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.914
- Will you give
us a moment lads?

14:30.453 --> 14:31.545
What couldn't wait?

14:31.546 --> 14:33.747
- How long have you known?

14:33.748 --> 14:34.670
- Known about what?

14:34.671 --> 14:36.793
- Don't play stupid with me.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.711
- Follow me.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.257
- Steady on.

14:45.009 --> 14:45.805
Steady on.

14:45.806 --> 14:50.148
What makes it right for you to
storm over to me, in my bar,

14:53.935 --> 14:57.229
at my table, like a little
girl having a tantrum

14:57.230 --> 14:58.571
and throwing her
toys out the pram?

14:58.572 --> 15:00.280
We were talking serious
business in there.

15:00.281 --> 15:00.945
Did you know that?

15:00.946 --> 15:02.738
- You were talking
about setting up

15:02.739 --> 15:04.863
an old man's club,
it's hardly serious.

15:04.864 --> 15:06.032
- Oh, fuck sake Well.

15:06.033 --> 15:07.498
- Why didn't you tell me?

15:07.499 --> 15:09.157
- Who told you?

15:09.158 --> 15:10.450
Rosaleen again?

15:10.451 --> 15:12.294
She never knows when to
keep her big mouth shut.

15:12.295 --> 15:13.412
- Tell me why.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.791
- I'm sorry, all right.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.011
- Fine, just tell
me what I came here

15:20.012 --> 15:23.004
to find out and I'll
get out of your way.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.632
- You tell me why, and
I might give it to you.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.969
- Because I wanna know,
that's why, why else?

15:28.970 --> 15:31.348
- Well you see, that's
where you're going wrong.

15:31.349 --> 15:34.683
It isn't what you want
in life that's important,

15:34.684 --> 15:36.186
it's what you need.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.270
Wait here.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.991
Is this what you need?

15:50.992 --> 15:53.618
- How long have you had this?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.041
- For a while now.

15:56.664 --> 16:00.834
Now listen, I had
this information

16:00.835 --> 16:03.338
because I wanted to do
something about it myself.

16:03.339 --> 16:06.298
Way back when you were
too young to understand.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.516
And the only reason
I didn't follow

16:07.517 --> 16:09.598
through on it was
because of my family.

16:09.599 --> 16:10.807
That's a lotto lose.

16:10.808 --> 16:13.022
- That's where you
and me are different.

16:13.023 --> 16:16.808
You still have yourfamily
and I want mine back.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.278
- I like to think
of you as my family.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.937
- You know what I mean.

16:20.938 --> 16:21.938
- I know.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.863
When I took you in,
I held you in my arms

16:29.864 --> 16:33.658
and I saw that your
heart was broken.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.663
As time passed, I
got to see it mend.

16:38.414 --> 16:42.792
I don't want you turning back
into that wee sad girl again,

16:42.793 --> 16:45.672
especially after
all this progress.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.641
I hope you get what
you're looking for.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.227
- Well.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.063
Well, can you wait?

17:03.064 --> 17:06.148
Well, can you just
wait up for a second?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.239
Are you all right?

17:07.240 --> 17:08.944
- Yeah, everything's fine.

17:08.944 --> 17:09.944
Why?

17:10.655 --> 17:11.863
- Why?

17:11.864 --> 17:13.490
You just looked really
aggravated earlier

17:13.491 --> 17:15.325
before you wanted
to speak to Rueben.

17:15.326 --> 17:16.621
What did you want to
talk to him about?

17:16.622 --> 17:17.836
- I told you it's
none of your business.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.454
- But it is though.

17:19.454 --> 17:20.170
- What?

17:20.171 --> 17:21.711
- It is my business,
especially if you've

17:21.712 --> 17:23.171
started hurting yourself again.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.626
I'm the first person
you need to be

17:24.627 --> 17:26.095
talking to about
that sort of thing.

17:26.096 --> 17:30.507
- What possibly makes you think
that that's your business?

17:30.508 --> 17:32.676
- Because I'm your boyfriend.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.271
- Look Ethan, we go
over this all the time.

17:35.272 --> 17:37.357
I see you like my brother.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.393
- Look. I got you something.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.602
- What?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.571
- I was in town, walking
around the market,

17:44.572 --> 17:48.066
and I found that
and thought of you.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.239
Do you like it?

17:51.153 --> 17:53.118
- It's lovely, but
I can't accept this.

17:53.119 --> 17:54.616
- Well, if you don't have it,

17:54.617 --> 17:58.493
then I'm not gonna give
it to anybody else, am I?

17:58.494 --> 17:59.370
- Thanks.

17:59.371 --> 18:00.912
- You're welcome.

18:00.913 --> 18:05.500
Look, um, you just
seem really stressed

18:05.501 --> 18:08.505
and I really think it would
do you a world of good

18:08.506 --> 18:11.131
to talk to somebody
about what's going on,

18:11.132 --> 18:12.384
especially because
I've told you all about

18:12.385 --> 18:14.384
my own foster parents
in the first place.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.682
- I just don't want
to talk about this.

18:15.683 --> 18:17.721
- That's not how this works.

18:17.722 --> 18:18.930
- I've got to go.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.146
- Can you just,
for a second, wait?

18:20.147 --> 18:21.641
- Would you get off?
- And we can talk.

18:21.642 --> 18:22.484
Why won't you just tell me?

18:22.485 --> 18:23.898
- Get off.

18:26.897 --> 18:27.897
- Fine.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.111
Always hiding from the truth.

18:32.737 --> 18:33.737
Coward.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.745
- That's just rubbish.

18:41.746 --> 18:42.912
- What is?

18:42.913 --> 18:44.128
- That if we make
a wrong decision,

18:44.129 --> 18:45.500
we shouldn't beat
ourselves up about it,

18:45.501 --> 18:47.834
that we should just
forget it happened.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.212
But what if the
decisions that we made

18:49.213 --> 18:51.176
caused pain or distress
to someone else?

18:51.177 --> 18:53.800
- Have you hurt someone by
a decision you have made?

18:53.801 --> 18:57.222
- Again, you answer a
question by asking a question.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.971
Is this therapy or is
this an interrogation?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.431
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.433
- Look, why don't you just
help me so that I can buy you

19:03.434 --> 19:07.564
a pointless gift and live
happily ever fucking after?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.231
I'm sorry.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.903
I didn't mean to swear.

19:14.904 --> 19:15.904
- It's fine.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.995
How was your week?

19:19.992 --> 19:20.992
- Okay.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.210
That's a lie.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.666
It was crap.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.337
- Have you been writing
in your journal?

19:32.338 --> 19:33.672
- <i>No.</i>

19:33.673 --> 19:34.673
- Why not?

19:37.134 --> 19:39.135
- I felt stupid.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.685
- It's confidential
what you write in there.

19:41.686 --> 19:45.016
No one will see it,
not even myself.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.439
- Then what's the point in it?

19:46.440 --> 19:49.479
- It's just a way of
expressing yourself.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.107
Releasing some
tension on your mind.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.361
- I wouldn't know
where to start.

19:54.362 --> 19:57.409
- Just write, it
will come naturally.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.409
Expressing yourself is
good for your health.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.913
Containing it will destroy you.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.916
It's when you were in the army

20:09.917 --> 20:12.545
that's getting to you, isn't it?

20:22.763 --> 20:23.763
Stanley.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.151
Stanley, come sit back down.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.527
- I'm sorry, Bernadette.

20:37.528 --> 20:40.488
I know you're
trying but like all

20:40.489 --> 20:43.993
the previous therapists,
you can't help me.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.741
- Stanley, is that you?

21:24.742 --> 21:26.367
- Yeah.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.244
- How was your day?

21:28.245 --> 21:29.245
- Good.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.456
All good.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.586
Look, I'm tired.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.545
I'm gonna get an early night.

21:37.546 --> 21:38.546
- Oh, okay.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.472
Are you sure you're all right?

21:46.180 --> 21:47.180
- I'm fine.

21:48.724 --> 21:49.724
Goodnight.

21:52.353 --> 21:53.650
- Night darling.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.075
- I'm here.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.412
Yeah. it's beautiful.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.166
It's bigger than
I thought it'd be.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.001
Yeah, I will.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.470
- Now's your chance.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.563
Let's do this.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.936
- Rueben.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.104
- Ah, Ethan.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.855
What can I do you for?

24:42.856 --> 24:44.357
- Well, I was just wondering

24:44.358 --> 24:46.611
if you can help
me with something.

24:46.612 --> 24:48.319
- Sit down boy.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.320
- Thanks.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.842
- What's on your mind?

25:06.839 --> 25:08.432
- Well, she's gone.

25:09.967 --> 25:14.095
Don't know where and
it's driving me mad.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.392
- Let's just say
she's somewhere now

25:16.393 --> 25:17.858
and she'll be back
in a few weeks,

25:17.859 --> 25:21.102
and there's nothing
to worry about.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.604
- So you know where she is?

25:23.605 --> 25:25.773
- She's fine, boy.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.151
Don't be worrying yourself.

25:28.152 --> 25:29.870
- Will you tell me where she is?

25:29.871 --> 25:32.488
- It's not for me
to say where she is.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.332
Just go home and relax.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.453
- Why won't you tell
me where she is?

25:38.454 --> 25:41.080
- Now you're getting
on my last nerve

25:41.081 --> 25:42.048
with all these questions.

25:42.049 --> 25:44.042
Will you let it be?

25:44.043 --> 25:45.169
- This is crap.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.422
She's my girlfriend.

25:47.423 --> 25:49.890
I have the right to
know where she is.

25:49.891 --> 25:52.806
- You and Well,
will you let it go?

25:58.140 --> 26:02.226
Listen, let me give you
some friendly advice.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.812
Women are strange creatures.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.113
It's like it's in
their DNA or something.

26:09.860 --> 26:14.697
Times they'll make you feel
good, sometimes real good,

26:14.698 --> 26:16.574
and times they
make you feel bad.

26:16.575 --> 26:20.661
You see, let's get real,
you're in the friend zone.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.084
A place where a
woman will keep you

26:22.085 --> 26:24.457
for as long as she likes.

26:24.458 --> 26:28.258
If I was you, keep some
dignity and let it go.

26:36.178 --> 26:39.305
- All right, that's
it, you're done now.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.974
Spare me the father routine,
Rueben, you don't know me.

26:41.975 --> 26:42.942
- Now hold on a minute.

26:42.943 --> 26:45.061
- No, you hold on for a minute.

26:45.062 --> 26:49.190
I am sick and tired of
old fuckers like you

26:49.191 --> 26:51.656
telling me what I
can and cannot do.

26:51.657 --> 26:53.277
You should have no respect,

26:53.278 --> 26:55.279
and I've done more than
enough to earn your respect.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.122
- Don't you raise your voice...

26:56.123 --> 26:57.240
- Shut up!

26:57.241 --> 26:58.083
- What the fuck.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.284
- Shut the fuck up!

27:00.285 --> 27:01.536
- You don't know
what you've done.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.790
- We know exactly what
I'm doing, Rueben,

27:03.791 --> 27:05.291
and I'm not playing around.

27:05.292 --> 27:08.214
Tell me where she is or I'll
slice your fucking throat.

27:08.215 --> 27:10.461
- You ain't gonna do shit!

27:10.462 --> 27:12.338
- Rueben, just, just tell him.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.012
- Tell me where she is Rueben.

27:14.013 --> 27:15.258
No?

27:15.259 --> 27:16.975
You don't wanna tell
me, fine, fair enough.

27:16.976 --> 27:18.221
You know what,
maybe you're right.

27:18.222 --> 27:20.393
Maybe I'm not gonna
stab you, but Logan,

27:20.394 --> 27:23.643
I think Logan's gonna
kill your barmaid.

27:28.939 --> 27:30.898
- You are a dead man.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.900
- And you need to
be really clever

27:32.901 --> 27:35.324
like all your other little
fuckers think you are,

27:35.325 --> 27:38.290
and you need to tell
me where she is.

27:52.838 --> 27:53.838
<i>- Hey.</i>

27:56.675 --> 27:59.177
You manage to get
on the slopes today?

27:59.178 --> 28:00.179
- No.

28:01.471 --> 28:04.307
- Can I buy you a drink?

28:04.308 --> 28:06.809
- I already have a drink.

28:06.810 --> 28:07.982
- Top up maybe?

28:09.521 --> 28:10.521
- <i>No.</i>

28:13.692 --> 28:15.693
- You know I haven't figured
you out vet but I will.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.361
- What are you
talking about, aye?

28:17.362 --> 28:18.579
- Well there isn't
much else to do here

28:18.580 --> 28:19.619
apart from ski and drink.

28:19.620 --> 28:20.823
- I am drinking.

28:20.824 --> 28:24.368
I just don't wanna
drink with you.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.623
- Yeah, well no harm
in making friends.

28:30.083 --> 28:32.177
- I'm looking for someone.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.295
- Who?

28:38.383 --> 28:39.847
- I don't think you'd know him.

28:39.848 --> 28:42.515
He's not exactly the ski
instructor type I'd imagine.

28:42.516 --> 28:45.059
- Well, being the ski instructor
type and a taxi service

28:45.060 --> 28:48.100
for the tourists, I get
to meet a lot of people.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.193
I'm good with names and faces.

28:49.194 --> 28:50.645
- Oh, I don't know.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.900
- Well, if you tell me his
name, I might be able to help.

28:53.901 --> 28:56.743
I'm a known man
around these parts.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.196
Look, let me get you a top up

29:00.197 --> 29:02.746
and I might be able to help you.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.203
- Fine.

29:10.374 --> 29:11.374
- Fine.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.261
Yeah, I know everyone
around these slopes.

29:14.262 --> 29:16.674
The one with the information,
I'm the go-to guy.

29:16.675 --> 29:18.968
Two Jagerbombs and
tequilas, please.

29:18.969 --> 29:21.056
So, what part of
Northern Ireland

29:21.057 --> 29:22.510
did you say you were from then?

29:22.511 --> 29:23.511
- I didn't.

29:24.346 --> 29:25.311
Belfast.

29:25.312 --> 29:26.312
- To Belfast!

29:29.226 --> 29:30.398
And friendship.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.111
Same again.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.281
So, who is it you're
looking for then?

29:43.282 --> 29:45.453
- Like I said, you
probably won't know him.

29:45.454 --> 29:46.951
- Well how about
this, if you name

29:46.952 --> 29:49.296
who it is you're looking
for and I don't know him,

29:49.297 --> 29:53.259
scout's honor, I'll buy
all the drinks all night.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.588
- Fine, I'll take your offer.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.842
His name is Stanley Winters.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.510
- Who?

30:04.511 --> 30:05.933
- Stanley Winters.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.433
Yeah, didn't think
you'd know him.

30:10.434 --> 30:11.981
- Hang on, hang on.

30:15.439 --> 30:16.647
Nope.

30:16.648 --> 30:20.026
- It's fine, I must
have been misinformed.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.945
- I know a Stanley Winters.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.698
Question is, why
do you want him?

30:25.699 --> 30:28.367
- Uh, he's a distant relative.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.707
Where would I find him?

30:29.708 --> 30:30.875
- Don't know where he lives

30:30.876 --> 30:34.081
but he skis down
Chemin Dur most days.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.631
- No one ski's down Chemin Dur.

30:37.586 --> 30:39.429
It's avalanche country.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.208
- You're the first person
I've seen all morning.

31:59.209 --> 32:00.506
My name is Well.

32:04.297 --> 32:06.465
It's a lovely place here.

32:06.466 --> 32:09.844
You're a bit away from
civilization, it's nice.

32:09.845 --> 32:10.845
- Yeah.

32:12.848 --> 32:14.225
- You seem a bit startled.

32:14.226 --> 32:15.516
Are you in a rush?

32:15.517 --> 32:16.767
- Yeah.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.520
<i>I</i> got someone to meet.

32:20.605 --> 32:21.730
- No, wait.

32:21.731 --> 32:22.731
Wait.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.144
- Are you okay?

33:00.145 --> 33:02.313
- Do I look okay?

33:02.314 --> 33:03.486
Ah, ah, my leg.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.902
- Relax a moment.

33:07.903 --> 33:09.621
- My camera's broken.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.532
- Can you walk?

33:13.533 --> 33:15.367
- I think so.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.249
- You shouldn't
be up here alone.

33:18.250 --> 33:19.747
This mountain is dangerous.

33:19.748 --> 33:21.373
- Well, it's not my fault.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.000
If you hadn't ignored
me in the first place

33:23.001 --> 33:25.095
and skied off, I'd
never have fallen.

33:25.096 --> 33:28.386
- Yeah, well, come
on, I'll help you up.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.860
- What are you doing?

33:49.861 --> 33:51.946
- I'm gonna carry you.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.572
- No, you're not.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.701
- You got any better ideas?

34:00.997 --> 34:03.249
My house is at the
foot of the mountain.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.250
<i>Come on.</i>

34:07.379 --> 34:08.379
Up.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.197
Be right back.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.722
Hold that in place.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.103
- Would you like me
to take my boots off?

36:29.104 --> 36:30.229
- <i>No.</i>

36:30.230 --> 36:31.322
No, ifs fine.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.035
- So you're in the army?

36:37.612 --> 36:39.330
- That was a long time ago.

36:39.331 --> 36:40.869
- How long exactly?

36:43.118 --> 36:44.995
- Stanley, is that you?

36:48.164 --> 36:49.211
- Yes, mother.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.168
- I thought I heard
you talking to someone.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.887
Were you talking
to yourself again?

36:54.888 --> 36:56.630
- That would be me.

36:56.631 --> 36:57.965
- On.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.560
Oh, I'm sorry, you
gave me a fright there.

37:00.561 --> 37:02.928
I didn't mean to intrude.

37:02.929 --> 37:05.476
I didn't realize you
had company, Stanley.

37:05.477 --> 37:07.146
- She had a fall on the slope.

37:07.147 --> 37:08.976
She'll be on her way soon.

37:08.977 --> 37:09.977
- A fall?

37:11.104 --> 37:12.354
Are you hurt?

37:12.355 --> 37:13.689
- Just my leg.

37:13.690 --> 37:14.862
- Well, is it bad?

37:14.863 --> 37:16.734
- It's a bit swollen.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.701
- Well, you must get her
something for the swelling.

37:18.702 --> 37:19.696
- She has something.

37:19.697 --> 37:21.118
- Oh, that's good.

37:22.824 --> 37:26.410
My goodness, what were
you doing out this far?

37:26.411 --> 37:29.496
It's quite dangerous
up that mountain.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.998
- I know.

37:30.999 --> 37:34.001
I was up there taking photos.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.211
So peaceful out there.

37:36.212 --> 37:39.465
- Well, it is
lovely, I remember.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.467
I wasn't always blind.

37:41.468 --> 37:43.302
I used to ski myself.

37:43.303 --> 37:46.096
- How is your knee feeling?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.723
Would you like me
to call you a taxi?

37:47.724 --> 37:48.724
- A taxi?

37:49.642 --> 37:51.110
But you've only just arrived.

37:51.111 --> 37:54.396
Surely you'll have a
tea or a coffee or.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.692
- I'm sure the idea of talking

37:55.693 --> 37:57.191
over a coffee sounds appealing

37:57.192 --> 37:59.320
but I'm sure you have other
things you need to do.

37:59.321 --> 38:01.904
Right?
- Nonsense, Stanley.

38:01.905 --> 38:04.620
You must stay and
have something to eat.

38:04.621 --> 38:06.617
I'm sorry I didn't
catch your name.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.665
- It's Well.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.204
- I'm Mary.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.830
Are you hungry?

38:11.831 --> 38:13.165
- I am a little.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.166
- Mother.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.052
- Then how about dinner?

38:18.213 --> 38:19.927
We don't have guests very often.

38:19.928 --> 38:21.971
I would love you
to stay for dinner.

38:21.972 --> 38:23.091
Will you stay?

38:23.092 --> 38:26.386
- If ifs not too much trouble.

38:26.387 --> 38:27.388
- Not at all.

38:30.558 --> 38:31.935
That's that then.

38:58.586 --> 39:02.557
- It doesn't
matter, it doesn't matter.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.272
- Well.

40:00.273 --> 40:02.446
- You frightened
the life out of me.

40:02.447 --> 40:05.319
- I have that effect on people.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.320
Sorry.

40:07.363 --> 40:10.287
Could you come with
me for a second?

40:20.793 --> 40:23.467
Would you be a treat and help
me pick a dress for dinner?

40:23.468 --> 40:24.630
- Sorry?

40:24.631 --> 40:26.715
- We must dress for dinner.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.717
Like I said, we don't
have visitors very often.

40:28.718 --> 40:30.937
This as a special occasion.

40:40.146 --> 40:42.022
- This is a gorgeous color.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.366
- Bring it to me.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.454
Ah, the red silk.

40:52.825 --> 40:54.327
The red silk dress.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.329
- How do you know?

40:57.330 --> 41:01.249
- I couldn't forget
this dress if I tried.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.502
1985, the last time I wore it.

41:03.503 --> 41:04.925
Oh, how we danced.

41:06.506 --> 41:07.673
My husband and I.

41:07.674 --> 41:09.597
Our wedding anniversary.

41:12.261 --> 41:14.480
But it wouldn't fit me now.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.684
Why don't you try it on?

41:18.685 --> 41:19.935
- I couldn't.

41:19.936 --> 41:21.483
- But it would look
wonderful on you.

41:21.484 --> 41:25.607
- It's beautiful but what
would I wear on my feet?

41:25.608 --> 41:26.608
- Shoes.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.115
Have a look in the
bottom of the wardrobe.

41:29.116 --> 41:31.991
There are some shoe
boxes in there.

41:33.241 --> 41:37.041
There should be a little
black pair somewhere.

41:39.288 --> 41:41.206
- Cool camera.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.750
My dad had one years ago.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.460
- Oh, that old thing.

41:45.461 --> 41:47.259
That hasn't seen
the light in years.

41:47.260 --> 41:48.630
- Polaroid.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.799
Does it still work?

41:50.800 --> 41:53.969
- I don't know, I
should think so.

41:53.970 --> 41:54.937
You're into photography.

41:54.938 --> 41:56.681
Why don't you have it?

41:57.765 --> 42:00.183
It's no use to me
collecting dust here.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.184
- Thank you.

42:10.445 --> 42:12.785
- It's nice to have
another woman to talk to.

42:12.786 --> 42:15.245
- It's very kind of
you to let me stay.

42:15.246 --> 42:17.164
- It's me who should thank you.

42:17.165 --> 42:20.414
Having you here is
good for Stanley too.

42:26.502 --> 42:27.502
Stanley.

42:35.887 --> 42:38.221
- You look beautiful, mother.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.940
- Look to the stairs.

42:58.993 --> 43:01.166
- You got my things.

43:20.640 --> 43:26.019
- And the other one is,
what is green, green, green,

43:26.020 --> 43:29.106
red, green, red,
red, red, red, red?

43:29.107 --> 43:30.899
- Um, I don't know.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.277
- A frog in a blender.

43:32.278 --> 43:34.611
- That's horrible.

43:34.612 --> 43:35.862
- It's not very nice, is it?

43:35.863 --> 43:37.206
But those are the kind
of jokes George used

43:37.207 --> 43:38.949
to tell me and I
said, "Please stop",

43:38.950 --> 43:42.124
and he'd do it in
company all the time.

44:10.022 --> 44:13.191
- So how long have
you lived here?

44:13.192 --> 44:16.653
- Almost five years
now since the accident.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.697
How quickly time goes by.

44:18.698 --> 44:22.951
- I mean, it is beautiful but
there's not a lotto do here.

44:22.952 --> 44:25.704
- It's where we came
when Stanley was a boy.

44:25.705 --> 44:27.831
It was our second home.

44:27.832 --> 44:30.000
His father loved to ski.

44:30.001 --> 44:34.629
It just seemed the right
place to come back to.

44:34.630 --> 44:37.257
- It's also quiet.

44:37.258 --> 44:39.761
There's not many people around.

44:41.846 --> 44:45.140
- Stanley isn't one for
crowds, as you can tell.

44:45.141 --> 44:48.393
- Yeah, but it's very isolated.

44:48.394 --> 44:50.067
Doesn't it worry you
being up here all alone?

44:50.068 --> 44:51.735
Like what if something happened?

44:51.736 --> 44:54.024
- She's not alone.

44:54.025 --> 44:55.322
We can look after ourselves.

44:55.323 --> 44:59.321
- I didn't mean it like that.

44:59.322 --> 45:03.283
- Well was telling
me she's from Belfast.

45:03.284 --> 45:07.996
You were stationed there,
weren't you, Stanley?

45:07.997 --> 45:10.250
I've heard it's a
beautiful place.

45:10.251 --> 45:11.341
- Yeah. it is.

45:13.753 --> 45:16.671
- And do you have a
big family, Well?

45:16.672 --> 45:20.050
- To be honest, I haven't
got much family left.

45:20.051 --> 45:21.769
- Oh, that's a shame.

45:26.891 --> 45:29.565
- What is the
reason you're here?

45:35.816 --> 45:40.737
- Um, I'm having a bit of
a break from my boyfriend.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.197
- On.

45:42.198 --> 45:44.326
- We needed some time
apart and the Alps seemed

45:44.327 --> 45:47.244
as good a place as
any to clear my head.

45:47.245 --> 45:49.964
- Well, relationships
can be very tricky

45:49.965 --> 45:52.374
to get right sometimes.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.423
You can often feel
like running away.

45:54.424 --> 45:56.378
- Oh, I'm not running.

45:56.379 --> 45:58.505
I just needed some time.

45:58.506 --> 46:00.882
- Looks like you're running.

46:00.883 --> 46:01.805
- Stanley.

46:01.806 --> 46:04.886
- No, he has a fair point.

46:04.887 --> 46:07.310
I just needed some time alone.

46:21.779 --> 46:24.656
- Well, would you
pop up and fetch

46:24.657 --> 46:26.250
that camera we found
in the wardrobe?

46:26.251 --> 46:28.702
- Yeah, of course I will, Mary.

46:28.703 --> 46:31.456
- You make an old
lady very happy.

46:34.875 --> 46:36.626
- Do you really have to do this?

46:36.627 --> 46:38.211
- Stanley.

46:38.212 --> 46:41.384
She's a young woman on her
own in a strange country

46:41.385 --> 46:43.430
and she's obviously
been through a lot.

46:43.431 --> 46:45.593
- Yeah, well, we all have.

46:45.594 --> 46:47.934
- Why are you being so
hostile towards her?

46:47.935 --> 46:49.976
- I'm just not ready
to make friends yet.

46:49.977 --> 46:51.317
My mind is all over the place.

46:51.318 --> 46:53.357
- Could you at least try?

46:55.604 --> 46:57.402
This is a happy night.

46:59.233 --> 47:01.861
Not everything
has to make sense.

47:02.945 --> 47:04.112
- Got it.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.365
- Oh, wonderful.

47:07.074 --> 47:08.616
Let me show you.

47:08.617 --> 47:09.826
Where are you now, Stanley?

47:09.827 --> 47:10.669
- Here.

47:10.670 --> 47:12.254
- Oh, there you are.

47:13.247 --> 47:14.464
- Are you ready?

47:16.292 --> 47:18.835
- Hang on, you've got
to be in this too.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.712
- Well, I can't set it to
take an automatic photo.

47:20.713 --> 47:22.213
It's too old.

47:22.214 --> 47:26.051
- No, no, you just hold it
out and turn it towards us.

47:26.052 --> 47:27.052
- Okay.

47:28.012 --> 47:29.554
Great.

47:29.555 --> 47:30.555
All smile.

47:35.061 --> 47:36.061
- That's it.

47:39.482 --> 47:40.482
Could I have it please?

47:40.483 --> 47:42.406
- It will take a minute.

47:45.363 --> 47:47.864
- This is where we'll put it.

47:47.865 --> 47:48.865
How is it?

47:56.874 --> 47:58.208
- It's perfect.

47:58.209 --> 47:59.210
- Yes, it is.

48:11.430 --> 48:12.898
Will you lead, son?

48:23.776 --> 48:25.619
Today has been special.

48:27.113 --> 48:30.448
I really wish your father
was hereto share it.

48:30.449 --> 48:31.449
- So dol.

48:33.911 --> 48:36.585
- I know how hard it's been
for you looking after me

48:36.586 --> 48:40.333
when you have your own
life to worry about,

48:40.334 --> 48:42.678
but I want you to know
there's never been

48:42.679 --> 48:45.797
a moment when I
haven't appreciated it.

48:45.798 --> 48:47.550
And out of everything,

48:48.843 --> 48:51.972
if I could choose to
see anything again,

48:55.433 --> 48:58.107
just once, I would
see your face.

49:02.940 --> 49:03.940
My son.

49:05.985 --> 49:07.328
My beautiful boy.

49:14.910 --> 49:17.287
But I'm being rude.

49:17.288 --> 49:20.918
I should let you dance
with the lovely Well.

49:22.251 --> 49:25.003
- Oh, no, I'm not sure.

49:25.004 --> 49:26.254
- Well, I wasn't asking.

49:26.255 --> 49:27.552
- No, no,
no, no, no, no, mother.

49:27.553 --> 49:28.923
This isn't a good idea.

49:28.924 --> 49:29.924
- Stanley'!

49:30.593 --> 49:31.640
- Mother, no!

49:33.804 --> 49:35.727
I'm not dancing anymore.

49:42.605 --> 49:43.605
- Fine.

49:46.567 --> 49:48.276
I'll do the washing up.

49:48.277 --> 49:49.779
- Mother.

49:52.281 --> 49:53.874
- If you want to be discourteous

49:53.875 --> 49:56.868
to our guest, then so be it.

49:56.869 --> 49:57.789
- Let me do it.

49:57.790 --> 49:58.790
<i>' No!</i>

50:01.290 --> 50:02.633
You always do it.

50:05.628 --> 50:08.802
It's only fair that
I do it this time.

50:25.648 --> 50:27.232
- No, don't.

50:27.233 --> 50:28.576
Please, leave it.

50:33.072 --> 50:34.745
I'm sorry about that.

50:37.117 --> 50:38.369
- No. it's fine.

50:56.470 --> 50:57.470
What?

50:59.223 --> 51:00.598
- It's nothing.

51:00.599 --> 51:02.934
- No really, what is it?

51:02.935 --> 51:04.027
- Your wrists.

51:05.563 --> 51:07.110
- I don't quite see what
it is you're getting at.

51:07.111 --> 51:09.700
- If you need to talk to anyone.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.448
Look, we all have our demons.

51:17.700 --> 51:19.498
It's just how we deal with them.

51:19.499 --> 51:22.412
- You wanna be the
hero, is that it?

51:22.413 --> 51:26.040
You wanna save the
damsel in distress?

51:26.041 --> 51:28.920
My wrists are like this because
tried to take my own life

51:28.921 --> 51:31.838
on more than one
occasion actually.

51:31.839 --> 51:33.091
Sometimes the thought of death.

51:33.092 --> 51:34.757
Even just the word
is comforting to me,

51:34.758 --> 51:36.634
but I keep going because
my heart wants something.

51:36.635 --> 51:38.057
- Okay, calm down.

51:43.058 --> 51:45.106
What is it that you want?

51:47.187 --> 51:49.064
- It's not what I want.

51:51.692 --> 51:53.035
It's what I need.

51:55.321 --> 51:56.321
I.

51:59.700 --> 52:00.542
- Mum.

52:00.543 --> 52:02.161
Mum, what's happened?

52:03.412 --> 52:04.914
Mum, you all right?

52:06.332 --> 52:07.999
- I'm tired, Stanley.

52:08.000 --> 52:08.842
- Let me take you up to bed.

52:08.843 --> 52:10.086
It's been a long day.

52:10.087 --> 52:14.130
- No, I mean I'm tired
of being old and alone.

52:14.131 --> 52:15.923
- Mum, you're bleeding.

52:15.924 --> 52:16.800
Let me see it.

52:16.801 --> 52:18.092
- I can do this.

52:18.093 --> 52:20.261
I don't need your help.

52:20.262 --> 52:23.014
- Mum, leave all this,
I'll finish that.

52:23.015 --> 52:24.015
<i>' No!</i>

52:24.767 --> 52:26.019
I need to do it.

52:27.936 --> 52:30.655
And you need to find someone
to share your life with.

52:30.656 --> 52:34.744
This is no life for you,
here, with me.

52:41.492 --> 52:44.994
- This is where I want to be.

52:44.995 --> 52:46.588
Right here with you.

53:00.219 --> 53:02.517
- You're a good boy, Stanley.

53:04.556 --> 53:06.479
I know you miss him too.

53:10.104 --> 53:11.856
- Goodnight.

53:29.790 --> 53:32.213
- You're very gentle with her.

53:34.753 --> 53:35.878
I didn't mean to.

53:35.879 --> 53:36.879
It's just.

53:39.675 --> 53:40.675
It's nice.

53:44.471 --> 53:46.098
- Can you sleep here?

53:47.725 --> 53:50.228
- Yeah, that's fine, thank you.

53:59.445 --> 54:02.321
It's really good of
you to take me in.

54:02.322 --> 54:03.494
I don't know what
I would have done

54:03.495 --> 54:05.743
if you hadn't of been there.

54:07.828 --> 54:09.125
- You're welcome.

54:10.998 --> 54:15.094
I'll show you the directions
to the town in the morning.

54:23.343 --> 54:27.439
You know, it really, it
really was nice meeting you.

54:46.867 --> 54:50.167
You were about to say
something earlier.

54:51.205 --> 54:52.205
What was it?

54:53.207 --> 54:55.666
- Um, it was nothing.

54:55.667 --> 54:56.918
- Really?

54:56.919 --> 54:59.172
- Yeah, honestly,
it was nothing.

55:04.426 --> 55:05.426
- Good night.

55:07.095 --> 55:08.095
- Night.

56:17.708 --> 56:20.427
- I'm sorry for
storming out the other day.

56:20.428 --> 56:22.545
- It's fine.

56:22.546 --> 56:25.381
- Do you do couples therapy?

56:25.382 --> 56:26.725
- Why do you ask?

56:27.801 --> 56:29.144
- This is a sofa.

56:30.053 --> 56:31.846
There's room for two.

56:31.847 --> 56:33.055
- Ves, I do.

56:33.056 --> 56:36.310
- Marital problems,
work, stress, sex life.

56:39.229 --> 56:40.479
- Many things.

56:40.480 --> 56:41.902
- Anything interesting?

56:41.903 --> 56:44.775
- I can't disclose
such information.

56:44.776 --> 56:45.868
- Fair enough.

56:50.073 --> 56:51.871
I wrote in the journal.

56:52.951 --> 56:54.577
- Good.

56:54.578 --> 56:56.171
How did you find it?

56:57.956 --> 56:59.048
- Interesting.

57:01.335 --> 57:05.431
It made me realize that I
really am damaged goods.

57:06.757 --> 57:09.806
- That is an
interesting observation.

57:11.929 --> 57:12.929
- No really.

57:19.895 --> 57:21.317
I better be going.

57:22.981 --> 57:26.484
- We will continue this
tomorrow morning if you're free.

57:26.485 --> 57:28.112
I know we normally
meet once a week

57:28.113 --> 57:29.987
but I think it would
be good to carry on

57:29.988 --> 57:32.366
with this fresh in our minds.

57:38.705 --> 57:39.956
Okay.

57:39.957 --> 57:40.799
- See you.

57:40.800 --> 57:42.293
- See you tomorrow.

59:20.057 --> 59:21.149
- Well, wait.

59:22.601 --> 59:23.853
Well, will you slow
down for a second?

59:23.854 --> 59:25.061
We're here to help you.

59:25.062 --> 59:26.277
- Ethan, I don't need your help.

59:26.278 --> 59:27.897
And what the fuck is
he doing here with you?

59:27.898 --> 59:28.865
- Who is she fucking talking to?

59:28.866 --> 59:30.359
- Will you shut up for a second?

59:30.360 --> 59:31.650
Why didn't you just tell me

59:31.651 --> 59:32.571
you were coming here
in the first place?

59:32.572 --> 59:33.536
- It's none of your business.

59:33.537 --> 59:35.071
- None of my business.

59:35.072 --> 59:36.494
Everything is my
fucking business.

59:36.495 --> 59:39.909
Well, were you here
for another man?

59:39.910 --> 59:42.745
You make me so fucking angry.

59:42.746 --> 59:44.330
Look. we can talk about this.

59:44.331 --> 59:45.922
Like we should have
done back in Belfast

59:45.923 --> 59:47.461
after all the times I've
buried my soul for you

59:47.462 --> 59:49.085
because that's what couples
do when they need it.

59:49.086 --> 59:50.836
- But we're not Ethan.

59:50.837 --> 59:52.305
And the sooner you
get that through

59:52.306 --> 59:56.550
your thick skull the
better we'll both be.

59:56.551 --> 59:58.010
- And that's it.

59:58.011 --> 59:59.263
You're just gonna say that?

59:59.264 --> 01:00:01.472
I come here and you say that?

01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:05.101
All right, you're gonna make
your decision right now.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:06.354
Is it him or me?

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.197
But if you come back to
me, Well, if you come back

01:00:09.198 --> 01:00:13.285
to one of your own, I'll forgive
you for all of this shit.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:18.616
But if you go to him, I'll
never, never speak to you again.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:25.539
Don't touch me, just
tell me what you want.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.797
- I can't Ethan.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:33.630
- That's it, that's
your last word?

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:42.725
All right, I want it back, I
want the bracelet back, Well.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:44.315
Give me the bracelet back, Well.

01:00:44.316 --> 01:00:45.558
- That's enough.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:46.900
You're letting that
bitch walk all over you.

01:00:46.901 --> 01:00:48.144
- Just leave her,
just leave her.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.565
- But that's not what we agreed.

01:00:49.566 --> 01:00:50.985
- I don't care what we said.

01:00:50.986 --> 01:00:53.655
Leave her here,
let her rot here.

01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:58.242
I don't ever wanna
see you again.

01:00:58.243 --> 01:00:59.455
Do you hear me?

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:02.366
I said do you hear me?

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:03.367
- I do.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.847
- Hey Stan, how you doing?

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:25.848
- Not bad, thanks.

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:26.691
Yourself?

01:01:26.692 --> 01:01:28.276
- Yeah, not too bad.

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:41.619
- Did my order come in?

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.367
- Yeah. I got it here.

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:50.833
- Cost me a fortune in
postage and packaging.

01:01:50.834 --> 01:01:52.379
Anyway, thanks Jim.

01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:55.341
- Hey, before you
go, did she find you?

01:01:55.342 --> 01:01:57.421
Your niece, is it?

01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:58.631
<i>'</i> My niece?

01:01:58.632 --> 01:01:59.599
- Yeah.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.343
Pretty young thing. dark hair.

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:06.430
She was asking after
you three days ago.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:09.934
- No, you must have me
mistaken for someone else.

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:14.021
- Maybe not, maybe it
was me, my mistake.

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:15.522
- Bye.

01:02:15.523 --> 01:02:16.775
- See you.

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:32.132
- This bloody cold.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:46.887
And what is wrong with you boy?

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:50.224
You come out all this
way just to tell her off,

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:53.060
not even a slap on the wrist.

01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:55.814
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:00.990
Are we really going home?

01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:02.829
- What do you want
me to do, Logan?

01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:04.822
- What do you think?

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:06.416
We should kill the bitch.

01:03:06.417 --> 01:03:07.658
- Come on.

01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:09.912
- Seriously, she has
disrespected you,

01:03:09.913 --> 01:03:12.039
and she has
disrespected our culture

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.881
by going with a man like that.

01:03:13.882 --> 01:03:15.332
A fucking Englishman.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.709
- You don't know he's English.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.587
- I do. I can smell it.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:28.012
Will you turn that engine
off for Christ's sake?

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.930
This is what we're gonna do.

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:31.390
We're gonna split up.

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:33.064
One take out the Englishman
and the other go up

01:03:33.065 --> 01:03:36.687
to that house and
bring that bitch back.

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:41.483
- Right and what if she
doesn't want to come home?

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:42.985
You're out of your mind.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:44.825
- You dragged me out
here to bloody France

01:03:44.826 --> 01:03:46.447
so I can do what
you don't want to.

01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:47.665
- I didn't drag you out here.

01:03:47.666 --> 01:03:49.408
- You call yourself a man?

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:50.831
You're like a fucking
woman treading

01:03:50.832 --> 01:03:52.295
all over you like
you're nothing.

01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:55.247
- This is what I
don't understand.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:59.626
Even when I first met her,
she was really nice to me

01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:03.714
and listen, you know,
like properly listen.

01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:06.884
And so I told her about
my father dying in '91

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:10.554
and she put her arm around me

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:13.149
and said, "Ethan, I understand.“

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:19.146
And from that moment I
knew we were meant to be.

01:04:19.147 --> 01:04:21.774
Well, I thought we were
meant to be together.

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:25.279
- It's a damn shame,
but she has got to go.

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:33.003
We've come this far so we
might as well finish it.

01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:41.168
If you're not going
to, then I am.

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:43.968
- All right, all
right, just wait.

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:51.020
All right then.

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:05.659
You had these in the
boot the whole time?

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:07.069
- Aye.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:08.283
- What about border control?

01:05:08.284 --> 01:05:09.738
We could of got caught.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.912
- Ah, they don't check unless
you're black or a Muslim.

01:05:11.913 --> 01:05:13.706
- That's a load of
crap and you know it.

01:05:13.707 --> 01:05:15.202
- What?

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:16.455
You'd rather we stuck them
up our arse holes then?

01:05:16.456 --> 01:05:17.922
- No, but I know
you'd love that.

01:05:17.923 --> 01:05:20.124
- Ah, your ma loves it.

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:22.167
Right, you got the
house or the hill?

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:23.010
- The house.

01:05:23.011 --> 01:05:24.670
This one's the house.

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:26.672
I'll take the house then.

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:28.424
- You sure about that?

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:29.768
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:49.463
- Oh, shit.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:03.393
Fuck it.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.365
What are you waiting for?

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.506
- Who gave you this?

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:40.175
How do you know where I live?

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.429
- If you think I'm
gonna tell you that,

01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:44.350
then you're as
dumb as I expected.

01:09:44.352 --> 01:09:46.098
- As you expected?

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.558
You don't even know me, boy.

01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:49.559
Now tell me.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.983
Why are you trying to kill me?

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:56.150
- Why not?

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:02.661
I do things like this
because sometimes

01:10:02.662 --> 01:10:06.662
it gives me pleasure to
fuck with people's lives.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:11.674
The only real reason I'm out
here in this shit box of ice.

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:14.418
Fuck you, you fucking.

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:49.828
- Well.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:54.416
Well.

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:12.851
- Well?

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:19.733
- I will give you
one last chance,

01:11:19.734 --> 01:11:21.987
and you better hope
it's the right answer.

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:27.991
- I'm the least of your worries.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:30.370
While you're here,
my friend is probably

01:11:30.371 --> 01:11:32.496
having fun with your
mother and that bitch.

01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:50.847
- Oh, fuck.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.600
Well.

01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:55.685
Well.

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:00.524
Well.

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:02.943
Well.

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:05.445
Well.

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:08.907
Well, I need your help.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:09.908
I swear.

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:17.379
You don't need to
be hiding from me.

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:26.216
Well.

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:54.329
I know you're in here.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:10.635
I've been in a really dark
place recently, Well.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:13.139
I feel so much shame, you know.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:19.686
You embarrass me
every time I see you,

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:22.531
and it confuses
the fuck out of me.

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:27.369
I know we care about each other,

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:33.167
but you haven't been showing
that lately, have you?

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:43.001
We had something, didn't we?

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:45.045
We had something pure.

01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:49.176
Something that nobody else
in the whole world had.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:52.182
And we loved each other.

01:13:56.933 --> 01:14:00.528
That's why it's such a
fucking shame, Well.

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:06.109
But you've been a very,
very disloyal girlfriend.

01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:24.084
I'm sorry.

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:27.884
I'm really sorry.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:48.441
- Mother!

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:23.059
Mother!

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.276
No!

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:29.607
No!

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:02.682
Fucking bastard!

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:03.775
What do you want with me?

01:16:03.776 --> 01:16:04.809
Tell me!

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.644
Come on, tell me!

01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:07.487
- Stop it.

01:16:07.488 --> 01:16:09.272
<i>- Come on. Come on.</i>

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:10.273
Come on, tell me!

01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:11.116
- Stop it!

01:16:11.117 --> 01:16:12.610
- Tell me, tell me!

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:26.294
Was this what you need?

01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:29.626
Was it?

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.250
- What have you done?

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:49.093
I'll leave you alone.

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.094
- Sit down.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.189
Thank you.

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:11.616
I can't even remember the last
time I told her I loved her.

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:12.617
- She knew.

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:15.495
- Did she?

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:22.011
The one thing that gets me.

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:26.223
She died in the darkness, alone.

01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:33.602
But I should have taken
that bullet, not her.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:39.320
I'll tell you what I've deserve
for the things I've done.

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:42.652
- What did you do?

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:53.500
- Who are you?

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:56.369
- What'd you mean?

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:57.829
- Don't you fool me around.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:58.830
- You know who I am.

01:21:58.831 --> 01:21:59.831
- Do I?

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:06.629
All this that's happened
and you haven't called

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:11.217
the police or try
to run, which means

01:22:11.218 --> 01:22:15.096
that you're either strong-willed
or you're unsurprised.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:18.476
And if you're unsurprised, then
you knew this might happen.

01:22:18.477 --> 01:22:22.645
Therefore, you are
either working with them

01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:24.239
or they came here to get you.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.441
- I'm not listening to this.

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:28.568
- Jim, from the bar, said
that you were looking for me.

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:29.445
- No, I wasn't.

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:30.445
- Why?

01:22:31.155 --> 01:22:33.076
Don't lie to me,
tell me the truth.

01:22:33.077 --> 01:22:34.791
- I don't know, I don't know.

01:22:34.792 --> 01:22:36.033
- Tell me!

01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:37.660
Have you found what
you're looking for?

01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:38.744
Is it me?

01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:39.792
How long have you been looking?

01:22:39.793 --> 01:22:40.997
- Stanley, you're hurting me.

01:22:40.998 --> 01:22:41.874
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:42.875
- Oh, you know!

01:22:42.876 --> 01:22:44.377
You've known all along.

01:22:44.378 --> 01:22:48.296
You sat at my mother's table
and you lied to our faces.

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:51.507
And she took you
in, she took you in!

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:54.051
And in return, I had to place

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:56.929
her cold dead body in the Earth.

01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:57.772
Why?

01:22:57.773 --> 01:22:59.687
- You killed my brother!

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:01.934
- What?

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:07.320
- I didn't mean
for this to happen.

01:23:07.321 --> 01:23:11.652
They were coming for me
because I was coming for you.

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:14.572
You may blame me for
your mother's death,

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:17.167
but you took everything from me.

01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:25.126
How many innocent little
boys have you killed?

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:34.051
All my life I've thought
about this moment,

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:37.553
what I'd do to you.

01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:39.932
- Oh please, please shoot me.

01:23:40.891 --> 01:23:44.143
Please, please.

01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:47.023
- He was a child, my
brother, he was innocent.

01:23:47.024 --> 01:23:50.316
- Yes, please, shoot
me, do it, do it!

01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:53.116
- My father made the
decisions, not my brother.

01:23:53.117 --> 01:23:54.533
- Please shoot me!

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:11.504
- All my life I
thought killing you

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:15.100
would make things better,
make me feel good,

01:24:19.096 --> 01:24:23.226
but now I know what I really
need, is to forgive you.

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:30.583
- Hi there,
please leave a message.

01:25:30.584 --> 01:25:32.752
We'll respond as soon as we can.

01:25:32.753 --> 01:25:35.800
- Hello Stanley, this
is Bernadette speaking.

01:25:35.801 --> 01:25:38.763
Please call me as soon
as you get this message.

01:25:38.764 --> 01:25:41.308
I don't know if you've forgot
but we had a session booked

01:25:41.309 --> 01:25:45.399
for this morning and it's
not like you to not show up.

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:48.351
I'm concerned for
your well-being

01:25:48.352 --> 01:25:50.978
so please contact me as
soon as you get this.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:51.979
Thank you.

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:09.873
- I'm so sorry.

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:15.094
It's all wrong.

01:26:19.549 --> 01:26:23.474
By rights it should be
me in this hole, not you.

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:33.280
I've always seen life to
be cruel and unpredictable.

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:35.945
Left me scared.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.361
Held me back.

01:26:42.656 --> 01:26:46.331
Now I know that it's
just the nature of life.

01:26:50.497 --> 01:26:51.623
You were right.

01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:56.007
And I will try.

01:26:59.089 --> 01:27:00.089
