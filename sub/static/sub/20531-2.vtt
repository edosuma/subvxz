excited to be able to see this.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.670
ANA GRUIA:
So this is it.

00:09.670 --> 00:10.880
It's‐it's very heavy.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.510
‐It's heavy.
‐Wow.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.220
NARRATOR:
Could physical evidence

00:14.220 --> 00:18.350
of alien visitation
have been hiding in plain sight?

00:18.350 --> 00:21.020
TSOUKALOS:
This is a very strange piece.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.190
It is a strange piece
for us as well.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.150
NARRATOR:
Did part of an alien craft

00:26.150 --> 00:28.820
fall from space?

00:28.820 --> 00:32.610
GRUIA: We acknowledge these
uncertainties about its dating

00:32.610 --> 00:35.450
‐and its composition.
‐So we have a real mystery here.

00:35.450 --> 00:38.700
NARRATOR: Or are we looking at
alien technology

00:38.700 --> 00:41.540
made right here on Earth?

00:41.540 --> 00:44.540
This defies everything we know.

00:44.540 --> 00:45.540
Definitely.

Tuyên Quang Province,

01:20.580 --> 01:23.410
Northern Vietnam.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.920
January 2, 2016.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.090
During the early morning hours,

01:32.090 --> 01:35.840
three strange metal spheres
are seen falling from the sky.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.510
‐(people screaming)
‐Witnesses report

01:40.510 --> 01:42.850
that one of the spheres
seemed to be flying

01:42.850 --> 01:45.850
in a mysterious pattern
before crashing to Earth

01:45.850 --> 01:48.270
and making a loud
"thunder‐like" sound.

01:50.810 --> 01:56.450
Witnesses saw these
spherical‐shaped metallic balls,

01:56.450 --> 02:00.370
which were recovered by
the Vietnamese military.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.740
We have photographs of them,

02:02.740 --> 02:06.410
but we don't have
whatever the objects were.

02:06.410 --> 02:09.210
Now, of course,
the big question is:

02:09.210 --> 02:12.250
could they be connected
to the UFO phenomenon?

02:12.250 --> 02:18.300
Numerous similar spheres
were seen in Spain in 2015

02:18.300 --> 02:22.890
and in Africa in 2011.

02:22.890 --> 02:25.640
The skeptic would argue
that this is just simply

02:25.640 --> 02:28.940
space debris and nothing else.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.980
But what's particularly
intriguing is that,

02:30.980 --> 02:35.030
in March 1974,
a very strange sphere was found

02:35.030 --> 02:37.070
at Fort George Island
in Florida.

02:37.070 --> 02:39.070
It was found by the Betz family.

02:39.070 --> 02:43.030
NARRATOR:
On March 26, 1974,

02:43.030 --> 02:47.370
on a remote piece of land
in Ft. George Island, Florida,

02:47.370 --> 02:50.500
owned by Gerri and Antoine Betz,

02:50.500 --> 02:54.000
a wildfire broke out
in the middle of the night,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.250
burning acres of brush.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.590
The cause of the fire
is unknown.

03:01.590 --> 03:06.220
But the next day, as the family
was investigating the damage,

03:06.220 --> 03:08.890
they came upon a strange object:

03:08.890 --> 03:13.110
a metal sphere.

03:13.110 --> 03:16.860
DICK BURNETT: Gerri Betz and
her son Terry went out there,

03:16.860 --> 03:20.610
and Terry sees this
metallic‐looking ball

03:20.610 --> 03:22.240
in the ground there.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.950
And he picks it up
and shows it to his mother,

03:24.950 --> 03:27.990
and they take it
back to the house.

03:27.990 --> 03:31.120
And a couple of weeks went by,

03:31.120 --> 03:36.550
and Terry had the ball
on a table next to his bed.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.260
And he took his guitar out.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.880
He started strumming it.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.510
And the ball started vibrating.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.600
TOM BURNETT:
I was about ten or 11,

03:47.600 --> 03:50.180
and one night
they pulled it out.

03:50.180 --> 03:52.690
We got I think it was
a mayonnaise lid out,

03:52.690 --> 03:54.520
and we were holding it
in different places

03:54.520 --> 03:56.150
on the, on the sphere.

03:56.150 --> 03:58.150
And it would be magnetized

03:58.150 --> 04:00.650
and stick in some areas
and not in others.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.900
I can't remember

04:02.900 --> 04:05.700
which household member said,
"Well, watch this."

04:05.700 --> 04:08.870
And they walked past it, it was
sitting on the carpeted floor,

04:08.870 --> 04:11.330
and it followed them
and moved as they did.

04:11.330 --> 04:13.210
They took a few steps
and turned,

04:13.210 --> 04:16.170
and it rolled right behind them
and to a stop.

04:16.170 --> 04:20.170
I had never seen
anything like it before.

04:20.170 --> 04:22.970
NARRATOR: The Betz sphere
began to make headlines

04:22.970 --> 04:25.800
in April of 1974.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.640
One of the first
to break the story

04:27.640 --> 04:31.220
was a young reporter
named Ron Kivett,

04:31.220 --> 04:34.730
who conducted an exclusive
interview with Gerri Betz

04:34.730 --> 04:37.810
just after she had made
her amazing discovery.

05:04.090 --> 05:06.340
(birds squawking)

05:06.340 --> 05:11.260
NARRATOR:
In February of 2017,

05:11.260 --> 05:13.730
investigative journalist
Linda Moulton Howe

05:13.730 --> 05:16.190
traveled to
Jacksonville, Florida,

05:16.190 --> 05:19.110
just 20 miles from the site
where the Betz family

05:19.110 --> 05:21.190
made their incredible discovery.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.030
‐Hi, Ron.
‐Hi, Linda.

05:23.030 --> 05:25.070
‐Nice to meet you.
‐It's good to meet you.

05:25.070 --> 05:27.160
‐Come on in.
‐Yes. Thank you.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.870
NARRATOR: She arranged to meet
with Ron Kivett

05:29.870 --> 05:31.790
to get a firsthand account

05:31.790 --> 05:34.660
of his experience
with this bizarre object.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.790
You've actually held
this silver sphere.

05:36.790 --> 05:39.250
I have actually
held the ball, right.

05:39.250 --> 05:42.170
Talk about what happened.
I'm so curious.

05:42.170 --> 05:45.090
You get to their house.

05:45.090 --> 05:47.470
How was the Betz sphere
introduced?

05:47.470 --> 05:50.760
‐How did they show you?
‐Um...

05:50.760 --> 05:55.850
The ball was on a coffee table,
a glass‐topped coffee table

05:55.850 --> 05:57.850
in a foyer much like this,
a little bit larger,

05:57.850 --> 05:59.560
but it was windows

05:59.560 --> 06:02.070
all the way around,
almost like an atrium.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.940
And, uh, I said, you know,
"Can I pick it up?"

06:04.940 --> 06:06.530
Gerri said, "Oh, sure."

06:06.530 --> 06:09.450
So I‐I picked it up,
and it was heavier

06:09.450 --> 06:11.660
than I anticipated it to be.

06:11.660 --> 06:13.580
About 20 pounds, right?

06:13.580 --> 06:15.330
That's what they say, yeah,
about 20 pounds.

06:15.330 --> 06:17.750
The ball had a much rougher
texture to it

06:17.750 --> 06:19.790
than I anticipated.

06:19.790 --> 06:21.710
And if you moved it,
you could hear

06:21.710 --> 06:24.420
a very faint tinkling inside it.

06:24.420 --> 06:27.590
(faint tinkling)

06:27.590 --> 06:31.970
It wasn't a hum or a buzz,
it was that tink, tink, tink.

06:31.970 --> 06:34.100
Terry had the ball in his room,

06:34.100 --> 06:37.890
and he began to notice that even
when the ball wasn't moving,

06:37.890 --> 06:40.980
he could hear
this tinkling sound.

06:40.980 --> 06:43.770
Well, it would suggest
it was conscious,

06:43.770 --> 06:46.820
or was downloading,
uploading information

06:46.820 --> 06:50.160
from something that
it was involved with.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.870
Well, the consciousness of it.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.530
I decided I wanted
to take the ball outside

06:54.530 --> 06:56.660
and get some pictures
with natural light.

06:56.660 --> 06:59.410
The ball was back on the table.

06:59.410 --> 07:02.580
So we all get up to leave to go
find a spot to shoot it in,

07:02.580 --> 07:05.130
and the ball rolled

07:05.130 --> 07:07.920
all the way to the edge
and stopped.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.340
And it was just like,
"Don't forget me."

07:11.340 --> 07:13.680
That's when the hair
stood up on my arms.

07:13.680 --> 07:17.470
NARRATOR: After observing
the strange behavior

07:17.470 --> 07:19.350
of the sphere for several weeks,

07:19.350 --> 07:22.190
the Betz family decided
to submit it

07:22.190 --> 07:25.270
to the military for examination.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.320
DAVID WILCOCK:
It got interest from the Navy.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.570
It got interest from
the United States government.

07:29.570 --> 07:32.160
And during the testing of it,

07:32.160 --> 07:36.120
they found it was made of a
stainless steel metallic alloy,

07:36.120 --> 07:40.000
specifically the ferrous alloy
number 431.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.920
And then when it was analyzed
with X‐ray spectography,

07:44.920 --> 07:48.670
the interior of the sphere
was hollow

07:48.670 --> 07:52.050
and had smaller
spherical objects,

07:52.050 --> 07:57.760
which were analyzed to have
an atomic weight of 140.

07:57.760 --> 08:01.980
Now, the largest atomic weight
that we see in nature

08:01.980 --> 08:04.440
is uranium, which is a 92.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.020
So these smaller,

08:07.020 --> 08:09.400
super heavy balls
that were inside,

08:09.400 --> 08:11.650
with an atomic weight of 140,

08:11.650 --> 08:14.240
caused certain scientists
to speculate

08:14.240 --> 08:17.240
that if anyone actually tried
to drill inside the sphere,

08:17.240 --> 08:20.160
that it could be the equivalent
of a thermonuclear weapon,

08:20.160 --> 08:23.420
that those elements
could go into criticality

08:23.420 --> 08:25.210
and create a massive explosion.

08:29.840 --> 08:34.760
So the point is, this sphere
has very peculiar properties

08:34.760 --> 08:37.300
that suggest that it is in fact

08:37.300 --> 08:40.010
some sort of artificially
intelligent technology.

08:42.140 --> 08:46.150
Do you think that it is
a viable hypothesis

08:46.150 --> 08:50.690
that at least the Navy,
from the work that they did,

08:50.690 --> 08:53.360
‐knew this is not terrestrial?
‐Oh, absolutely.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.280
And it was after
the Navy examination...

08:56.280 --> 08:58.200
Right.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.160
...that everything seemed
to basically come to a halt.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.250
Correct.

09:03.250 --> 09:08.000
I never got a real clarification
on what happened, you know.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.800
But now the ball
has disappeared.

09:12.800 --> 09:16.380
NARRATOR: Is it possible
the Navy discovered evidence

09:16.380 --> 09:20.930
that the Betz sphere is of
extraterrestrial origin,

09:20.930 --> 09:24.520
and secretly confiscated it
for further examination?

09:26.810 --> 09:29.810
DICK BURNETT: Gerri and
her family are not interested

09:29.810 --> 09:32.440
in talking about
the sphere anymore.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.530
They just don't want to discuss
what happened with it.

09:36.530 --> 09:38.910
Maybe nobody
will ever see it again.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.740
That's a possibility, you know?

09:40.740 --> 09:42.290
I don't know.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.160
NARRATOR:
To date,

09:44.160 --> 09:46.750
no one has been able
to locate the sphere

09:46.750 --> 09:49.500
or explain what it was.

09:49.500 --> 09:53.210
But perhaps further clues
may be found

09:53.210 --> 09:57.430
by returning to the very site
where the mysterious Betz sphere

09:57.430 --> 09:59.300
was first discovered.

10:10.730 --> 10:12.980
HOWE:
Talking with the Betz Family,

10:12.980 --> 10:16.610
you thought you're dealing
with really honest people

10:16.610 --> 10:18.780
who are very puzzled about
what this sphere is.

10:18.780 --> 10:22.950
When I first talked to them,
I was convinced

10:22.950 --> 10:25.580
that all of them
were telling me the truth.

10:25.580 --> 10:28.210
NARRATOR:
Fort George Island, Florida.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.580
February 3, 2017.

10:31.580 --> 10:35.000
Investigative journalist
Linda Moulton Howe

10:35.000 --> 10:37.670
is traveling
with reporter Ron Kivett

10:37.670 --> 10:40.680
to the site
where a mysterious metal sphere

10:40.680 --> 10:43.390
that displayed
the uncanny ability

10:43.390 --> 10:46.310
to move on its own
was first discovered

10:46.310 --> 10:49.140
in 1974 by the Betz family,

10:49.140 --> 10:51.980
following a wildfire
on their property.

10:51.980 --> 10:55.610
This would have been an area
where the fire would have been.

10:55.610 --> 10:57.690
We're getting closer.

10:57.690 --> 11:01.070
KIVETT:
Now, this is the kind of woods

11:01.070 --> 11:03.320
they would have found it in.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.580
All of this here, you can see
where the‐the palmettos.

11:05.580 --> 11:06.910
‐Yeah.
‐It's thick.

11:06.910 --> 11:08.620
It's hard to go through.

11:08.620 --> 11:10.920
In fact, it's almost amazing.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.960
‐Without the fire... ‐Without
the fire, they probably...

11:12.960 --> 11:14.590
They would never have found it.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.090
Gosh.

11:16.090 --> 11:18.090
So, the mys...
There's the mystery

11:18.090 --> 11:20.090
‐of what caused the fire...
‐Right.

11:20.090 --> 11:22.510
...how long it had
been there, and...

11:22.510 --> 11:24.010
Was it intended to be found?

11:24.010 --> 11:25.720
Wow.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.220
NARRATOR: Skeptics of
the Betz sphere story

11:28.220 --> 11:30.770
claim it was part of a sculpture

11:30.770 --> 11:32.650
that fell from
an artist's truck.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.020
KIVETT: So this is what
it would have all looked like

11:35.020 --> 11:36.860
before the fire.

11:36.860 --> 11:39.860
NARRATOR: But Ron Kivett
says this is impossible,

11:39.860 --> 11:41.400
since the sphere was discovered

11:41.400 --> 11:44.740
in the middle
of a densely forested area

11:44.740 --> 11:49.120
20 miles from any stretch
of main highway.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.160
You know, now that I'm here

11:51.160 --> 11:53.830
where the Betz family
found that sphere,

11:53.830 --> 11:57.630
it's just so clear
that any of the stories

11:57.630 --> 12:00.760
about an artist over on the road
having something falling

12:00.760 --> 12:02.760
off a truck and rolling

12:02.760 --> 12:05.140
‐through all of this thick
palmetto... ‐It's impossible.

12:05.140 --> 12:06.970
Impossible.

12:06.970 --> 12:10.140
And the whole idea

12:10.140 --> 12:11.560
that they would
never have found it

12:11.560 --> 12:13.310
‐if there had not been
a fire... ‐No.

12:13.310 --> 12:15.480
The fire was integral
to finding the ball.

12:15.480 --> 12:20.110
What do you think,
talking with Terry and Gerri?

12:20.110 --> 12:21.530
I know they found it.

12:21.530 --> 12:23.910
I know how they...
how they found it.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.370
They knew right away, you know,

12:25.370 --> 12:26.910
after that‐that
first incident or so,

12:26.910 --> 12:28.530
that they had something special.

12:28.530 --> 12:32.210
If it was a hoax,
somebody put it there.

12:32.210 --> 12:35.580
If it was not a hoax,
somebody put it there.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.040
‐It's...
‐Or something.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.500
Or something.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.210
NARRATOR:
If this mysterious sphere

12:41.210 --> 12:43.800
was of extraterrestrial origin,

12:43.800 --> 12:46.760
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest,

12:46.760 --> 12:49.680
might it have been
intentionally placed

12:49.680 --> 12:53.690
on the Betz's property
and even have started the fire

12:53.690 --> 12:56.150
that resulted in its discovery?

12:57.730 --> 13:00.320
Throughout history,

13:00.320 --> 13:03.030
similar spheres
have appeared in artwork

13:03.030 --> 13:05.240
that dates back
hundreds of years

13:05.240 --> 13:09.200
and are often depicted
as coming from the heavens.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.370
WILLIAM HENRY:
In Christian art, you'll see

13:11.370 --> 13:12.950
these incredible examples

13:12.950 --> 13:15.790
of angels holding
bowling ball‐size spheres

13:15.790 --> 13:16.960
in their hands.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.170
In other examples,

13:19.170 --> 13:22.710
Jesus himself
holds a metallic sphere.

13:22.710 --> 13:27.930
God is portrayed
holding a sphere.

13:27.930 --> 13:30.810
So when you go back
to the Betz family

13:30.810 --> 13:32.720
and compare it with what we know

13:32.720 --> 13:35.020
about these spheres
and Christian mythology,

13:35.020 --> 13:36.690
you have to ask,

13:36.690 --> 13:39.610
are‐are we dealing
with something of ancient origin

13:39.610 --> 13:42.440
or possibly of
extraterrestrial origin?

13:42.440 --> 13:45.450
(faint tinkling)

13:45.450 --> 13:48.490
HOWE:
Where is that sphere today?

13:48.490 --> 13:50.490
My wager?

13:50.490 --> 13:54.790
One of our government agencies
has this Betz sphere,

13:54.790 --> 13:58.500
and our government has probably
learned a great deal

13:58.500 --> 14:02.550
about a sphere that has
self‐activating software

14:02.550 --> 14:07.130
and maybe has been sending
and receiving the whole time.

14:07.130 --> 14:11.260
NARRATOR: The concept of
a self‐activating metal sphere

14:11.260 --> 14:13.180
with the ability to communicate

14:13.180 --> 14:16.390
is not as farfetched
as it may sound.

14:16.390 --> 14:20.190
In fact, science is
on the verge of discovering

14:20.190 --> 14:22.650
a similar technology today.

14:22.650 --> 14:25.230
Beijing, China.

14:25.230 --> 14:27.780
March 2015.

14:27.780 --> 14:31.530
Here at Tsinghua University,

14:31.530 --> 14:36.160
scientists announce the creation
of a self‐fueled robot

14:36.160 --> 14:39.420
in the form
of a small liquid metal sphere

14:39.420 --> 14:42.540
that is capable
of shape‐shifting.

14:42.540 --> 14:46.170
JEFF WILLIAMS: When energy
is applied from the outside,

14:46.170 --> 14:48.420
externally, the metal
would change shape.

14:48.420 --> 14:51.390
But they also noticed
that it could also produce

14:51.390 --> 14:53.640
its own power supply
for about an hour,

14:53.640 --> 14:58.600
and because of this action,
it would move, too.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.020
And, of course, most people
are considering using it

15:01.020 --> 15:02.610
in the field of robotics.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.610
Just imagine where that can go.

15:06.900 --> 15:10.360
WILCOCK: We're seeing the
first steps that we are making

15:10.360 --> 15:14.280
towards having these types
of exotic alloys

15:14.280 --> 15:18.160
that could, in the future,
give us the ability to emulate

15:18.160 --> 15:19.960
the type of
extraterrestrial technology

15:19.960 --> 15:23.420
that we already see
in out‐of‐place artifacts.

15:23.420 --> 15:26.960
NARRATOR: In addition to
creating shape‐shifting robots,

15:26.960 --> 15:30.760
this new technology
may be used by doctors

15:30.760 --> 15:35.390
to make repairs inside the body
without performing surgery.

15:35.390 --> 15:39.680
It could also lead
to fully flexible electronics,

15:39.680 --> 15:44.810
as well as major advances
in artificial intelligence.

15:44.810 --> 15:47.900
Some ancient astronaut theorists
propose

15:47.900 --> 15:51.570
that it was a similar technology
that powered the Betz sphere.

15:51.570 --> 15:55.160
This is a possible explanation

15:55.160 --> 15:59.290
for what could be going on
with the super heavy balls

15:59.290 --> 16:01.410
inside the Betz sphere.

16:01.410 --> 16:05.590
They may be using some
sort of similar technology

16:05.590 --> 16:08.630
in order to roll themselves
around inside,

16:08.630 --> 16:11.840
which then allows the ball
to be able to roll around,

16:11.840 --> 16:14.510
much like a self‐propelled
bowling ball.

16:14.510 --> 16:16.430
So with these new discoveries,

16:16.430 --> 16:18.260
we now have
a plausible explanation

16:18.260 --> 16:20.930
for how the Betz sphere
was able to roll around.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.060
DAVID CHILDRESS: As modern
scientists develop new alloys,

16:26.060 --> 16:28.400
we have to wonder
if these artifacts,

16:28.400 --> 16:32.150
like the Betz sphere, they are

16:32.150 --> 16:37.620
perhaps there for us to examine
and retro‐engineer

16:37.620 --> 16:40.580
and use and create for ourselves

16:40.580 --> 16:42.710
and our own space industry.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.420
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

16:47.420 --> 16:50.590
that objects
like the Betz sphere

16:50.590 --> 16:53.380
have been purposely left behind
by extraterrestrials

16:53.380 --> 16:55.050
for thousands of years

16:55.050 --> 16:57.090
in order to help
in the development

16:57.090 --> 16:59.640
of mankind's
technological evolution.

16:59.640 --> 17:02.480
As further proof,

17:02.480 --> 17:05.560
they point
to mysterious metal ingots

17:05.560 --> 17:07.310
recently recovered
from a shipwreck

17:07.310 --> 17:10.360
off the coast of Sicily
that are unlike

17:10.360 --> 17:13.990
any other metal
known to exist on Earth.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.290
NARRATOR:
Sicily. 2015.

17:26.290 --> 17:30.630
Archaeologist Sebastiano Tusa
excavates a shipwreck

17:30.630 --> 17:33.420
less than a mile off the coast,

17:33.420 --> 17:38.010
which has remained undisturbed
for more than 2,600 years.

17:38.010 --> 17:40.260
His team dredges up

17:40.260 --> 17:43.520
an ancient payload
of 39 metal ingots.

17:45.810 --> 17:48.020
Interestingly,
spectrographic analysis

17:48.020 --> 17:52.400
of the recovered alloy
reveals the compound is unlike

17:52.400 --> 17:55.740
anything ever found
in the ancient or modern world.

17:57.990 --> 18:00.240
The interesting part about this

18:00.240 --> 18:02.700
is the composition
of the ingots that they found.

18:02.700 --> 18:08.420
The metal is 80% copper
and 20% zinc.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.210
There was other things
found in it,

18:10.210 --> 18:13.130
but that's the majority
of the composition.

18:13.130 --> 18:17.760
Now, zinc only occurs in nature
as sphalerite.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.720
It's a zinc sulfur complex.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.760
In order to create zinc,

18:22.760 --> 18:25.020
which didn't come around till
about a thousand years ago,

18:25.020 --> 18:28.440
you have to actually
process the zinc out

18:28.440 --> 18:30.400
of this sulfide.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.150
They didn't have
that technology back then.

18:32.150 --> 18:36.070
WILCOCK:
What was someone doing

18:36.070 --> 18:41.320
blending together copper, zinc,
lead, nickel, iron?

18:41.320 --> 18:43.370
This is a complex alloy.

18:43.370 --> 18:45.370
This is nothing easy to do.

18:45.370 --> 18:47.710
It suggests the possibility

18:47.710 --> 18:50.120
that it could have
special electrical

18:50.120 --> 18:52.670
or energetic properties
that we don't even know about.

18:52.670 --> 18:55.420
People would not be expected

18:55.420 --> 18:58.470
to be making
such a complex alloy back then.

18:58.470 --> 19:02.510
NARRATOR: How is it possible
that such an advanced alloy

19:02.510 --> 19:06.520
was manufactured
over 2,600 years ago,

19:06.520 --> 19:09.190
centuries before
man had the technology

19:09.190 --> 19:13.150
to manipulate elements
like zinc into metals?

19:13.150 --> 19:16.570
And what was its purpose?

19:16.570 --> 19:19.820
Based on the composition
of this alloy,

19:19.820 --> 19:21.740
scientists believe
what they have found

19:21.740 --> 19:24.780
is orichalcum,
a metal associated

19:24.780 --> 19:27.160
with the legendary continent
of Atlantis.

19:29.370 --> 19:32.880
According to Plato's
fourth century dialogues,

19:32.880 --> 19:35.250
the <i>Timaeus</i> and <i>Critias,</i>

19:35.250 --> 19:38.130
Atlantis possessed
a power and technology

19:38.130 --> 19:42.010
greater than
any other civilization on Earth.

19:42.010 --> 19:46.810
It was founded and ruled over
by the Greek god Poseidon,

19:46.810 --> 19:49.680
whose temple was covered
in a precious metal

19:49.680 --> 19:51.480
called orichalcum,

19:51.480 --> 19:54.860
which translates
to "mountain copper."

19:54.860 --> 20:00.280
The composition of the alloy
is not specified by Plato,

20:00.280 --> 20:04.410
but based on its electrical
properties, color and luster,

20:04.410 --> 20:08.330
scientists suggest
that if it really did exist,

20:08.330 --> 20:10.540
it most likely
consisted of copper

20:10.540 --> 20:12.830
mixed primarily with zinc,

20:12.830 --> 20:17.040
just like the metal
found in the shipwreck.

20:17.040 --> 20:21.420
It was said that the temple
of Poseidon on Atlantis

20:21.420 --> 20:25.800
flashed with the red light
of orichalcum.

20:25.800 --> 20:29.970
The copper tint of this metal
caught the attention

20:29.970 --> 20:33.140
of the seekers
that came to this sacred place.

20:33.140 --> 20:35.440
This is not just
an attractive color.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.820
This has spiritual implications.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.900
There was something
about this metal

20:39.900 --> 20:42.740
that was said to resonate
with the divine.

20:42.740 --> 20:46.780
Perhaps it was its origin,
that it had come from heaven,

20:46.780 --> 20:48.490
it fell out of the sky.

20:50.700 --> 20:53.080
NARRATOR:
According to Plato's story,

20:53.080 --> 20:56.460
the Greek god Cadmus,
son of Poseidon,

20:56.460 --> 20:58.710
came down from Mount Olympus

20:58.710 --> 21:02.840
and gave orichalcum
to the people of Atlantis.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.630
An important figure
in early Greek mythology

21:05.630 --> 21:08.510
was Cadmus, a divine character,

21:08.510 --> 21:12.060
the first hero,
fifth in the lineage from Zeus

21:12.060 --> 21:14.270
of the Greek gods.

21:14.270 --> 21:18.230
It was Cadmus that brought
the making of bronze.

21:18.230 --> 21:22.110
He knew how to make alloys,
special metals, which,

21:22.110 --> 21:23.860
in the early days
of civilization,

21:23.860 --> 21:27.240
was the beginning of technology.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.910
So Cadmus is the one
who shows us

21:29.910 --> 21:32.910
the divine nature of metalwork

21:32.910 --> 21:36.120
and gives this as a gift
to the generations.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.210
WILCOCK:
Why are we so quick to dismiss

21:40.210 --> 21:43.760
the underlying stories
in those myths?

21:43.760 --> 21:45.670
Those stories
talk about extraterrestrials

21:45.670 --> 21:47.550
coming and visiting our culture.

21:47.550 --> 21:51.260
They talk about gods
that walked among us

21:51.260 --> 21:55.270
and interacted with humans
but with a severely advanced

21:55.270 --> 21:58.770
technology beyond anything
that we have today.

21:58.770 --> 22:01.770
Ancient astronaut theory says
that the legends

22:01.770 --> 22:04.690
of these Greek gods
are not just mythological,

22:04.690 --> 22:08.240
but they're actually rooted
in actual events.

22:10.030 --> 22:13.660
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the Greek gods

22:13.660 --> 22:17.040
were extraterrestrial beings
our ancestors witnessed

22:17.040 --> 22:19.080
descending from the sky,

22:19.080 --> 22:22.590
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest?

22:22.590 --> 22:25.920
And does the discovery
of orichalcum

22:25.920 --> 22:27.930
provide physical evidence

22:27.930 --> 22:31.760
that the legendary continent
of Atlantis truly existed?

22:31.760 --> 22:33.850
GEORGE NOORY:
These artifacts

22:33.850 --> 22:36.640
could allow you to conclude

22:36.640 --> 22:40.100
that the continent of Atlantis
was real,

22:40.100 --> 22:43.650
that it sank,

22:43.650 --> 22:47.950
and that it possessed
high technology

22:47.950 --> 22:51.570
before it met its tragic fate.

22:51.570 --> 22:54.370
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

22:54.370 --> 22:57.120
discoveries like
the metal ingots

22:57.120 --> 22:59.160
found off the coast of Sicily

22:59.160 --> 23:02.380
provide evidence
that extraterrestrials

23:02.380 --> 23:05.420
have been fostering mankind's
technological evolution

23:05.420 --> 23:08.670
for thousands of years.

23:08.670 --> 23:11.720
And they suggest that even more
compelling evidence

23:11.720 --> 23:16.100
can be found by examining
a mysterious artifact

23:16.100 --> 23:19.520
discovered in the tomb
of King Tut.

23:26.110 --> 23:28.030
NARRATOR:
Cairo, Egypt.

23:28.030 --> 23:31.610
At the Egyptian Museum,

23:31.610 --> 23:35.030
an entire floor is dedicated
to the incredible treasures

23:35.030 --> 23:38.500
found in the tomb
of King Tutankhamen.

23:38.500 --> 23:42.040
Among them is a metal dagger

23:42.040 --> 23:45.500
that has baffled both scientists
and archaeologists

23:45.500 --> 23:48.010
because it appears
to be made of iron,

23:48.010 --> 23:52.300
but dates back
to at least 1322 B. C.,

23:52.300 --> 23:56.060
more than a century
before Egypt's Iron Age.

23:56.060 --> 24:00.140
On May 20, 2016,

24:00.140 --> 24:03.270
a new layer
was added to the mystery.

24:03.270 --> 24:05.060
Researchers from

24:05.060 --> 24:07.690
the <i>Journal of Meteorics</i>
<i>and Planetary Science</i>

24:07.690 --> 24:10.190
announced that
they had finally determined

24:10.190 --> 24:13.660
the composition
of King Tut's dagger.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.280
After detailed analysis,

24:16.280 --> 24:19.500
it was confirmed
that the blade is indeed iron,

24:19.500 --> 24:22.960
forged from metal
that originated not on Earth

24:22.960 --> 24:25.250
but in the stars.

24:28.960 --> 24:33.430
Meteorites are very difficult,
uh, to fashion into objects.

24:33.430 --> 24:36.050
Anybody, even today,

24:36.050 --> 24:37.930
who's ever worked with
a meteorite will tell you

24:37.930 --> 24:40.100
that because
of the high nickel content,

24:40.100 --> 24:43.560
they're very, very brittle
and very difficult to work with.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.730
NARRATOR:
Considering the difficulties

24:45.730 --> 24:50.440
of working with meteoric metal‐‐
even with today's technology‐‐

24:50.440 --> 24:53.650
how did metallurgists
3,300 years ago

24:53.650 --> 24:55.990
perform such tasks?

24:55.990 --> 24:59.080
WILLIAMS: This dagger is
completely out of place

24:59.080 --> 25:00.580
in the fact that‐‐

25:00.580 --> 25:02.750
unlike simple objects,
like beads,

25:02.750 --> 25:05.460
that can be simply hammered out
and rolled‐‐

25:05.460 --> 25:09.040
this has been perfected
to a point where

25:09.040 --> 25:11.630
it has no hammer marks on it,
it's completely smooth,

25:11.630 --> 25:14.630
it has a nice edge
all the way around on it.

25:14.630 --> 25:17.720
It almost looks
as if it had been cast.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.760
But in order to achieve that,

25:19.760 --> 25:22.810
you would have to reach
temperatures of 3,000 degrees

25:22.810 --> 25:25.520
in order to melt that meteorite,

25:25.520 --> 25:28.190
and then, of course,
add the necessary fluxes

25:28.190 --> 25:31.400
to get the impurities out
and then cast the blade,

25:31.400 --> 25:35.200
which brings up even more
questions for the researchers.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.030
If they were smelting iron,

25:37.030 --> 25:40.240
it would change our whole
outlook on Egyptian history.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.290
NARRATOR:
What could explain the presence

25:44.290 --> 25:47.540
of this mysterious metal dagger
in King Tut's tomb

25:47.540 --> 25:51.380
when no other similar artifacts
have been found in Egypt

25:51.380 --> 25:53.840
dating back to this period?

25:53.840 --> 25:57.340
Might Egyptian metallurgists
have had help

25:57.340 --> 25:59.470
working with this
difficult compound?

25:59.470 --> 26:00.890
(man shouting
in foreign language)

26:00.890 --> 26:04.850
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

26:04.850 --> 26:08.190
and suggest stories found
throughout the ancient world

26:08.190 --> 26:12.230
reveal that extraterrestrials
taught our ancestors

26:12.230 --> 26:14.150
the secrets of metallurgy

26:14.150 --> 26:16.950
in order to help
move society forward.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.200
ROBERT SCHOCH:
True metallurgy,

26:19.200 --> 26:20.950
in the sense of

26:20.950 --> 26:23.660
putting different metals
together as alloys,

26:23.660 --> 26:27.080
dates back to maybe 3800 B. C.,

26:27.080 --> 26:31.840
when bronze was first discovered
as an alloy of tin and copper.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.800
Maybe the second most
important development

26:35.800 --> 26:37.170
after the harnessing of fire.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.470
YOUNG:
As we think of modern times

26:40.470 --> 26:42.140
and our emphasis on technology,

26:42.140 --> 26:44.970
here is the sacred roots
to all of that.

26:44.970 --> 26:48.810
Stories emerged
out of all the religious systems

26:48.810 --> 26:52.190
about the gods as metalworkers.

26:52.190 --> 26:54.900
Hephaestus,
in the Greek imagination,

26:54.900 --> 26:59.110
made weapons and the armor
for the gods.

26:59.110 --> 27:02.950
In the Celtic imagination,
it was the great goddess Brigid

27:02.950 --> 27:07.830
who made beautiful and wonderful
and powerful things into metal

27:07.830 --> 27:10.710
and then into fabricated form.

27:10.710 --> 27:14.500
In Japanese lore,
Canayago came to Earth

27:14.500 --> 27:17.300
to teach the people
metalworking.

27:17.300 --> 27:20.220
JASON MARTELL: There seems to be
a‐a ubiquitous understanding

27:20.220 --> 27:22.640
from ancient cultures
that metallurgy

27:22.640 --> 27:25.100
is from the heavens.

27:25.100 --> 27:28.480
Could there be some tie
that, in the past,

27:28.480 --> 27:32.190
certain abilities were
originally brought to man,

27:32.190 --> 27:34.440
possibly by extraterrestrials,

27:34.440 --> 27:36.730
and things we would create
had a certain energy

27:36.730 --> 27:40.150
or myth about them
that still is alive today?

27:40.150 --> 27:43.620
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

27:43.620 --> 27:45.740
the most compelling
of these stories

27:45.740 --> 27:50.330
originates in the same place
as King Tut's mysterious dagger:

27:50.330 --> 27:53.880
Egypt, where they worshipped
a sacred object

27:53.880 --> 27:55.750
called the Benben stone.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.220
Ancient Egyptian texts
describe the Benben stone

28:01.220 --> 28:06.890
as a meteoric iron object
that belongs to the heavens.

28:06.890 --> 28:12.190
The original Benben stone
mysteriously disappeared,

28:12.190 --> 28:15.480
but many ancient depictions
of it remain.

28:17.900 --> 28:21.900
The Benben stone
has a very strange origin.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.370
It is thought
that the Benben stone

28:26.370 --> 28:29.200
descended from the sky
like a firebird.

28:31.370 --> 28:33.670
If you look at the Benben stone,

28:33.670 --> 28:37.000
sometimes it is
described or depicted

28:37.000 --> 28:40.670
with people
coming out of this stone.

28:40.670 --> 28:43.510
Now, to me,
this looks very similar

28:43.510 --> 28:46.350
to a lunar module.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.470
If you have the idea
that this firebird

28:48.470 --> 28:52.430
is descending from the sky
with fire and smoke,

28:52.430 --> 28:54.560
well, if you look
at a rocket descending,

28:54.560 --> 28:57.230
these are firebirds.

28:57.230 --> 29:00.280
So our ancestors
perhaps witnessed

29:00.280 --> 29:04.240
some type of a craft
descending from the sky,

29:04.240 --> 29:07.030
out of which these
extraterrestrials came,

29:07.030 --> 29:12.330
which set in motion
our technological evolution.

29:12.330 --> 29:15.170
NARRATOR:
According to Egyptian texts,

29:15.170 --> 29:18.040
their gods were
extraterrestrial beings

29:18.040 --> 29:19.880
that came to Earth

29:19.880 --> 29:23.630
and taught our ancestors
the secrets of metalwork.

29:23.630 --> 29:28.100
If true, might this be why
we find isolated examples

29:28.100 --> 29:30.810
of advanced and sacred
metallurgy

29:30.810 --> 29:33.480
occurring long before
mankind was known

29:33.480 --> 29:36.140
to have grasped such technology?

29:36.140 --> 29:39.560
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

29:39.560 --> 29:43.530
and suggest that hidden away
in the storage area

29:43.530 --> 29:46.200
of a small museum
in Eastern Europe

29:46.200 --> 29:49.320
is even more
astounding evidence:

29:49.320 --> 29:54.620
the remnants of what might be
an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

29:54.620 --> 29:58.170
Transylvania, Romania.

29:58.170 --> 30:01.040
1970.

30:01.040 --> 30:04.420
Workers digging a trench
along the banks

30:04.420 --> 30:08.260
of the Mures River
unearth two giant bones,

30:08.260 --> 30:12.180
and, with them,
a mysterious metal object

30:12.180 --> 30:16.140
buried 35 feet
beneath the surface.

30:16.140 --> 30:20.020
The discovery
brings the project to a halt,

30:20.020 --> 30:24.480
as the crew takes their findings
to a nearby museum.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.190
This strange object,

30:26.190 --> 30:29.070
known today
as the Wedge of Aiud,

30:29.070 --> 30:31.910
continues to baffle
archaeologists

30:31.910 --> 30:34.160
because it is an aluminum alloy

30:34.160 --> 30:37.410
that appears to have been made
thousands of years before

30:37.410 --> 30:41.210
humans were able
to smelt or fabricate metal.

30:41.210 --> 30:47.170
It was ten meters in depth,
uh, associated with some bones,

30:47.170 --> 30:51.140
which they later identified
as woolly mammoth bones.

30:51.140 --> 30:54.220
If they were contemporary,
all of them,

30:54.220 --> 30:57.980
then they were in use sometime
in the period when Neanderthals

30:57.980 --> 31:02.020
roamed the earth, so they were
extinct 40,000 years ago,

31:02.020 --> 31:04.150
so they must be older than that.

31:04.150 --> 31:09.490
The wedge was analyzed
three times, to my knowledge.

31:09.490 --> 31:13.740
The main, uh, metal
in its composition is aluminum.

31:13.740 --> 31:16.080
MICHAEL DENNIN: Humans didn't
really start working

31:16.080 --> 31:18.540
with aluminum
until well into the 1800s.

31:18.540 --> 31:21.920
So when you look at this wedge
and you analyze it,

31:21.920 --> 31:24.090
it really has most
of the modern properties

31:24.090 --> 31:26.170
we would associate
with aluminum.

31:26.170 --> 31:30.050
NARRATOR: This incredible
metal artifact was discovered

31:30.050 --> 31:33.720
at a time when Romania
was behind the Iron Curtain

31:33.720 --> 31:35.970
of the former Soviet Union.

31:35.970 --> 31:38.310
For decades,

31:38.310 --> 31:40.600
government officials
refused to reveal

31:40.600 --> 31:42.810
where the Wedge of Aiud
was being held...

31:42.810 --> 31:45.110
(men shouting, gunfire)

31:45.110 --> 31:47.530
...even after the fall
of the USSR.

31:49.650 --> 31:51.200
(crowd cheering)

31:51.200 --> 31:55.240
But its location
has recently come to light,

31:55.240 --> 31:58.040
and in January of 2017,

31:58.040 --> 32:02.120
ancient astronaut theory pioneer
Erich von Daniken

32:02.120 --> 32:05.380
and his protégé
Giorgio Tsoukalos

32:05.380 --> 32:08.340
sought out the wedge
to see it for themselves.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.100
NARRATOR:
On January 18, 2017,

32:18.100 --> 32:23.100
at the National History Museum
of Transylvania,

32:23.100 --> 32:26.230
ancient astronaut theorists
Giorgio Tsoukalos

32:26.230 --> 32:29.280
and Erich von Daniken
were offered a rare opportunity

32:29.280 --> 32:32.240
to get a firsthand look
at the Wedge of Aiud.

32:32.240 --> 32:35.530
Museum curator Ana Gruia

32:35.530 --> 32:37.620
has taken it out
of a storage locker

32:37.620 --> 32:40.000
where it has been deliberately
hidden from the public

32:40.000 --> 32:42.460
since the early 1970s.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.580
This is exciting.

32:44.580 --> 32:46.880
Okay, I'm just going
to put my gloves on.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.500
TSOUKALOS:
This is great.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.920
GRUIA:
So this is it.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.050
‐TSOUKALOS: Oh, wow.
‐VON DANIKEN: Okay.

32:55.050 --> 32:57.140
‐This is the wedge.
‐This is strange.

32:59.970 --> 33:02.020
It's‐it's very heavy.

33:02.020 --> 33:03.850
‐Giorgio, take it.
‐This is crazy.

33:03.850 --> 33:07.110
‐It's heavy.
‐Wow.

33:07.110 --> 33:10.150
This was found
at a depth of ten meters,

33:10.150 --> 33:12.780
which is about 30 feet,
in the ground.

33:12.780 --> 33:14.650
‐GRUIA: Yes.
‐Yes, and here, this is the...

33:14.650 --> 33:16.360
‐where they took the sample
out... ‐VON DANIKEN: Yeah.

33:16.360 --> 33:17.910
...and here
to make the analysis.

33:17.910 --> 33:19.910
And here you see
two pieces that are

33:19.910 --> 33:24.330
broken off, sort of, so maybe
it was attached or something.

33:24.330 --> 33:26.330
But very strange.

33:26.330 --> 33:28.750
So what does the museum
have to say about this?

33:28.750 --> 33:30.710
This is a very strange piece.

33:30.710 --> 33:34.220
It is. It is a strange piece
for us, as well.

33:34.220 --> 33:38.720
As historians, we do not
consider it a historical object

33:38.720 --> 33:40.600
that we're used to.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.890
We don't know
what it was used for,

33:42.890 --> 33:47.770
and we acknowledge these
uncertainties about its dating,

33:47.770 --> 33:49.810
and its composition, as well.

33:49.810 --> 33:53.360
VON DANIKEN:
So, for what can you use this?

33:53.360 --> 33:56.240
It looks like a hammer
or a shovel, but,

33:56.240 --> 33:58.410
Giorgio, what is the word of...
in English...?

33:58.410 --> 33:59.820
(speaks foreign language)

33:59.820 --> 34:01.410
Oh, an excavator tooth.

34:01.410 --> 34:03.910
Well, it looks like this.

34:03.910 --> 34:05.660
‐It could have been
something like it. ‐Yeah.

34:05.660 --> 34:07.330
VON DANIKEN:
But these excavator tooths

34:07.330 --> 34:08.670
are never made out of aluminum.

34:08.670 --> 34:10.380
TSOUKALOS:
No, it's too weak.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.590
‐VON DANIKEN: Aluminum is
too soft. ‐Yeah.

34:11.590 --> 34:13.710
They are made out of steel,

34:13.710 --> 34:16.510
especially hard steel,
so it... it could not be that.

34:16.510 --> 34:18.890
So we have a real mystery here.

34:18.890 --> 34:23.310
But you see this patina
over this whole object?

34:23.310 --> 34:26.020
And this creates
another problem.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.940
TSOUKALOS: Yes, because
you cannot fake a patina.

34:28.940 --> 34:33.730
It's impossible
to artificially create a patina.

34:33.730 --> 34:36.900
NARRATOR:
The patina is a thin coating

34:36.900 --> 34:39.160
of various metal compounds
that forms

34:39.160 --> 34:41.120
on the surface of the metal

34:41.120 --> 34:43.870
during exposure
to atmospheric elements.

34:43.870 --> 34:46.000
The older the object,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.290
the thicker
the patina layer will be.

34:50.040 --> 34:53.920
It takes hundreds,
if not thousands of years

34:53.920 --> 34:56.170
for a thick layer of patina,

34:56.170 --> 34:59.880
as this apparently is,
for it to develop.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.180
Yes, we agree
there are two basic problems.

35:02.180 --> 35:04.510
One, that aluminum
was not invented

35:04.510 --> 35:08.480
at the age when we presume
this was in use.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.520
And second,
it's the patina, as you noted.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.360
VON DANIKEN: Which speaks
for the date for the...

35:12.360 --> 35:14.110
‐TSOUKALOS: Yes.
‐...for the age of it.

35:14.110 --> 35:17.860
So we still have a mystery here.

35:17.860 --> 35:21.200
Thank you very much
for, uh, showing us this object,

35:21.200 --> 35:23.660
because I know
that there was a time, uh,

35:23.660 --> 35:28.410
when nobody knew where it was‐‐
somewhere in a box in the back.

35:28.410 --> 35:31.540
Which means present‐day
archeology has a problem.

35:31.540 --> 35:34.290
And they're doing
magnificent work.

35:34.290 --> 35:36.960
But when something like this
comes along, you know,

35:36.960 --> 35:41.550
we should investigate this and
not put it in a box in the back.

35:41.550 --> 35:43.760
‐Definitely. ‐GRUIA:
It did depend on mentalities

35:43.760 --> 35:45.510
‐in official position.
‐Yes. ‐(laughs)

35:45.510 --> 35:48.890
It isn't
currently exhibited, uh,

35:48.890 --> 35:51.770
because we have to admit,
as historians,

35:51.770 --> 35:56.570
that we do not know
more details about it.

35:56.570 --> 35:59.650
For us, it's just baffling
at this point.

35:59.650 --> 36:02.740
But taking
the‐the logic further, uh,

36:02.740 --> 36:06.620
this conflicting information
could have just two solutions

36:06.620 --> 36:08.620
so far.

36:08.620 --> 36:10.910
One, that it is really
not so old,

36:10.910 --> 36:12.580
and the context is irrelevant,

36:12.580 --> 36:15.090
and the patina
was somehow produced

36:15.090 --> 36:18.170
in special circumstances.

36:18.170 --> 36:21.130
So it's a new object,
strangely preserved, let's say.

36:21.130 --> 36:23.760
And the second option is,
of course,

36:23.760 --> 36:27.060
that it's not
of terrestrial origin.

36:27.060 --> 36:30.770
In all of your adventures,
how does this compare

36:30.770 --> 36:34.480
to some of the other things
that are inexplicable?

36:34.480 --> 36:36.820
I am helpless. I have no idea.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.440
‐That says it all right there.
‐(laughs)

36:39.440 --> 36:42.110
Very bizarre. Bizarre.

36:42.110 --> 36:48.830
I've known about this thing
since the early 1990s,

36:48.830 --> 36:52.620
and I have to tell you
that looking at it

36:52.620 --> 36:56.630
in person was
a dream come true.

36:56.630 --> 37:01.050
And it's a very strange thing.

37:01.050 --> 37:03.090
I mean,
how do you explain this?

37:03.090 --> 37:09.390
It certainly looks as if
it was part of a larger object.

37:09.390 --> 37:14.940
The question is:
was it a component of a device?

37:14.940 --> 37:17.440
Was it a component
of something larger?

37:17.440 --> 37:20.570
NARRATOR:
If the Wedge of Aiud

37:20.570 --> 37:23.950
really is
over 40,000 years old,

37:23.950 --> 37:27.450
then who made it,
and what was it used for?

37:27.450 --> 37:30.910
Some ancient astronaut
theorists believe

37:30.910 --> 37:33.710
they may have the answer.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.540
An aeronautical engineer

37:35.540 --> 37:38.420
who saw the Aiud Wedge
looked at that and said,

37:38.420 --> 37:40.550
"That's a piece
of a landing gear

37:40.550 --> 37:44.010
for a vertical take‐off
and landing aircraft."

37:44.010 --> 37:47.260
Ancient astronaut theorists
have also looked at this wedge

37:47.260 --> 37:49.180
and surmised that it's possible

37:49.180 --> 37:52.600
that it's part of a crashed
extraterrestrial craft.

37:52.600 --> 37:57.100
NARRATOR: Could the Wedge
of Aiud really be a remnant

37:57.100 --> 37:59.560
of an extraterrestrial craft,

37:59.560 --> 38:02.190
perhaps similar
to the one some say

38:02.190 --> 38:05.530
the Egyptians represented
with the Benben stone?

38:05.530 --> 38:08.820
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

38:08.820 --> 38:11.580
and suggest evidence
recently recovered

38:11.580 --> 38:13.370
from a meteorite in Russia

38:13.370 --> 38:17.580
may be another gift
from our alien ancestors,

38:17.580 --> 38:21.920
one that propels us towards the
next great technological leap.

38:28.840 --> 38:32.890
NARRATOR:
Siberia, Russia. 1979.

38:32.890 --> 38:37.140
A meteorite crashes
into the Koryak Mountains.

38:37.140 --> 38:42.980
Nearly four decades later,
in December 2016,

38:42.980 --> 38:45.860
researchers studying pieces
of the meteorite

38:45.860 --> 38:51.240
at the University of Florence,
Caltech and Princeton announce

38:51.240 --> 38:54.830
that it has brought with it an
incredible, rare metal formation

38:54.830 --> 38:57.710
called a "quasicrystal."

38:57.710 --> 39:03.420
This quasicrystal features 60
points of rotational symmetry,

39:03.420 --> 39:07.590
made up of aluminum,
copper and iron.

39:07.590 --> 39:10.050
It is an exotic pattern

39:10.050 --> 39:12.640
that has never before
been found in nature,

39:12.640 --> 39:18.640
and could lead to the next
major technological leap.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.350
This thing should not exist,

39:21.350 --> 39:23.980
and yet there it is
on this meteorite.

39:23.980 --> 39:27.490
Now, quasicrystal alloys

39:27.490 --> 39:30.780
violate the known laws
of physics completely,

39:30.780 --> 39:34.280
but what we have heard
from whistleblowers is that

39:34.280 --> 39:36.370
the surfaces
of extraterrestrial vehicles,

39:36.370 --> 39:38.710
such as the one
that crashed in Roswell,

39:38.710 --> 39:41.460
are made of quasicrystal alloys.

39:41.460 --> 39:44.210
And certain quasicrystal alloys,

39:44.210 --> 39:47.710
when electrified,
generate antigravity.

39:47.710 --> 39:50.930
Extraterrestrial intelligences
may have been wanting us

39:50.930 --> 39:53.220
to find the quasicrystals,

39:53.220 --> 39:56.760
and it shows that there could be
a whole new world of technology

39:56.760 --> 39:58.930
waiting for us to unlock.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.810
And what we're looking at
is a very likely possibility

40:01.810 --> 40:04.690
that these
out‐of‐place artifacts

40:04.690 --> 40:07.320
are just some
of the table scraps

40:07.320 --> 40:09.320
from an extraterrestrial
civilization

40:09.320 --> 40:11.820
that had way more advanced stuff
than that.

40:15.660 --> 40:19.000
NARRATOR: Are extraterrestrials
giving mankind the tools needed

40:19.000 --> 40:23.790
to reach the next level
in our technological evolution?

40:23.790 --> 40:28.760
And if so,
where are they leading us?

40:28.760 --> 40:34.260
HENRY: The stories of these very
powerful ancient alloys suggest

40:34.260 --> 40:37.850
that these are pathways
back to our origins.

40:37.850 --> 40:40.560
That these are ways
that we can connect

40:40.560 --> 40:43.980
with our original
extraterrestrial visitors,

40:43.980 --> 40:46.150
and also point a way forward
for us,

40:46.150 --> 40:50.230
because as we begin to
understand these technologies,

40:50.230 --> 40:53.740
perhaps one day we'll even
be able to duplicate them.

40:53.740 --> 40:57.410
As modern scientists
develop new alloys,

40:57.410 --> 41:01.410
we have to wonder
if these ancient artifacts

41:01.410 --> 41:06.170
of strange alloys aren't
extraterrestrial artifacts

41:06.170 --> 41:12.590
that are perhaps there for us
to examine and retro‐engineer,

41:12.590 --> 41:17.720
and use and create for ourselves
and our own space industry.

41:17.720 --> 41:20.680
NOORY:
There is no question

41:20.680 --> 41:24.190
that we are getting closer
and closer

41:24.190 --> 41:27.770
to whatever technology
the extraterrestrials possessed.

41:27.770 --> 41:29.940
NARRATOR: Are the unexplained
metal artifacts

41:29.940 --> 41:33.440
found all over the world proof

41:33.440 --> 41:37.370
that we have been visited
by otherworldly beings?

41:37.370 --> 41:41.120
And did extraterrestrials
teach our ancestors

41:41.120 --> 41:44.290
secrets of metallurgy
that we are

41:44.290 --> 41:50.340
just now beginning
to develop and reproduce?

41:50.340 --> 41:54.510
Perhaps by examining
these strange metal objects,

41:54.510 --> 41:58.340
we will begin to not only
understand our past,

41:58.340 --> 42:03.430
but also be
better prepared to face...

42:03.430 --> 42:07.770
our ultimate destiny.
