00:01.801 --> 00:05.669
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.348 --> 00:17.942
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:21.545
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:40.867
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:40.940 --> 00:43.875
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:43.943 --> 00:47.071
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:47.147 --> 00:49.138
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:55.121 --> 01:00.286
<i>As one of the county's most celebrated
and dramatic murder trials was set to begin.</i>

01:00.360 --> 01:03.727
<i>1958.</i>

01:03.797 --> 01:07.233
<i>How long are you gonna
keep us tied up?</i>

01:07.300 --> 01:12.465
<i>What do you want? As convicted
murderer Leon Stiles escaped.</i>

01:12.539 --> 01:14.837
<i>I, uh-
Details remain sketchy at this time.</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:17.900
I don't want anything.

01:21.214 --> 01:23.409
Mommy, look, it's him!

01:23.483 --> 01:28.682
These are thought to be
the most recent photos of Stiles.

01:28.755 --> 01:32.156
Stiles escaped custody
in a daring daylight shootout.

01:32.225 --> 01:35.854
Stiles, described by authorities
as an illiterate drifter,

01:35.929 --> 01:38.159
was recently arrested
in connection with the murders...

01:38.231 --> 01:40.699
of at least eight women
in three states.

01:40.767 --> 01:45.295
At this moment, he is the central focus
in a county-wide manhunt.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.776
Oh, boy.

Advertise your product or brand here

03:04.851 --> 03:08.548
Stiles made his violent escape
after killing two deputies...

03:08.621 --> 03:11.112
and seriously wounding another.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.785
Police warn that
he may still be in the area,

03:13.860 --> 03:17.557
and should be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

03:17.630 --> 03:20.565
<i>In space, the Sputnik continues-</i>

03:22.068 --> 03:26.061
<i>I've always made it a rule never
tojudge people on first impressions.</i>

03:26.139 --> 03:28.801
<i>Of course, rules are made
to be broken.</i>

03:30.510 --> 03:33.638
There's some jewelry in the bedroom.
My wedding ring and some chains.

03:33.713 --> 03:37.114
You can have it.
I don't want your jewelry.

03:37.183 --> 03:41.244
L- I don't want anything.

03:41.321 --> 03:45.451
I just- I need a second to figure out
what's goin' on, that's all.

03:45.525 --> 03:48.153
Are you gonna kill us?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.253
Oh, no. L-

03:56.502 --> 03:58.663
No, of course not.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.332
I promise, we won't say
anything to anybody.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.672
I won't even call the police.
Just please let us go.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.317
Where are you, Al?

04:15.288 --> 04:18.849
<i>Where'd you get that gun?
I'm the one's askin'the questions.</i>

04:18.925 --> 04:23.692
Who are you?
Uh, I told you, my name's Al.

04:23.763 --> 04:27.529
- Yeah? Where am I?
- Uh, well, uh-

04:27.600 --> 04:30.694
I know you're confused and everything, but
I can't answer till you put the gun down.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.398
Just answer the question!

04:33.473 --> 04:36.135
Oh, uh, well, this is-
We call this the waiting room.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.177
Yeah? How'd I get here?

04:38.244 --> 04:41.975
Well, that's a tough one.
Especially with a gun pointed at me.

04:42.048 --> 04:45.677
- What's out there?
- Uh, out there?

04:45.752 --> 04:49.711
<i>Uh, oh- Uh, storerooms. Yeah, store-
We use them for st- We store things.</i>

04:49.789 --> 04:52.019
- Open it.
- No, I can't do that.

04:52.091 --> 04:56.391
- Why can't you? - Well, we got a
rule- No visitors can leave this room.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.954
Believe me, it's for your own
safety. I ain't gonna ask you again.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.297
Go on. Not gonna
ask again. Okay.

05:02.368 --> 05:05.769
All right. Uh, let's not do
anything that I'm gonna regret later.

05:05.838 --> 05:08.807
<i>Go on.</i>

05:08.875 --> 05:11.776
What the hell is all this? Uh,
what is all this? What is all-

05:11.844 --> 05:14.677
Well, it's, uh, it's sort of
an underground top secret...

05:14.747 --> 05:18.649
research laboratory-style
type of thing.

05:18.718 --> 05:22.017
Oh, boy. Admiral Calavicci,
I was just looking for you.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.556
Dr. Beckett.
Yeah, Gooshie.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.888
Admiral, Ziggy just received the
preliminary data on the new leap.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.894
Gooshie. And she's extremely con
- Dr. Beckett?

05:29.962 --> 05:32.328
What do you keep callin' me
that name for?

05:32.398 --> 05:36.198
Beckett?
Well, you look like him.

05:38.071 --> 05:41.837
- What's he talkin' about?
- That's another toughie.

05:41.908 --> 05:45.241
<i>No, wait.!
Hold it, hold it.! Hold it.</i>

05:45.311 --> 05:48.474
Put that gun down. If you kill
him, Dr. Beckett can never get back.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.210
Put your gun away.
That's an order, Corporal!

05:52.852 --> 05:57.050
Now, everybody, just take it easy,
and no one will get hurt here.

05:57.123 --> 06:00.115
You better do like he says!

06:00.193 --> 06:02.491
All right.
I'm gettin' outta here.

06:02.562 --> 06:06.623
And anybody tries followin' me,
I'll put a bullet through 'em. You!

06:06.699 --> 06:08.724
You got a car?
Yeah.

06:08.801 --> 06:11.361
Well, gimme the keys. Now!

06:11.437 --> 06:14.873
<i>Gimme that coat too.</i>

06:15.942 --> 06:18.240
Come on!

06:21.514 --> 06:24.108
How do I get outta here?
You!

06:24.183 --> 06:28.085
Tell me! You take the
elevator up 10 levels, and out.

06:28.154 --> 06:30.247
The car's right in front.
It's the blue one.

06:30.323 --> 06:34.726
Leon, I don't think you want to do this.
It's not what you think it is out there.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.160
I'll take my chances.

06:38.698 --> 06:41.064
Move, boy!

06:43.336 --> 06:45.634
Corporal, get on the horn. Make
sure nobody tries to stop that man.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.230
- On the double!
- I'll call the police.

06:48.307 --> 06:51.208
No, you can't. Quantum Leap is a code one
clearance. We can't involve other agencies.

06:51.277 --> 06:54.246
You know that! Anyway, it's too dangerous.
He's gotta be brought back alive.

06:54.313 --> 06:56.406
Who's goin' after him?
I am.

06:56.482 --> 06:59.474
You... would have been
my first choice.

06:59.552 --> 07:04.319
And I want Ziggy to put together a profile disk on
that guy and have it ready by the time I get back.

07:04.390 --> 07:08.156
Back? Where you goin'? Well,
I gotta break the news to Sam.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.525
I hope he's in a good mood.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.202
Hasn't this gone on long enough?

07:19.038 --> 07:21.472
We're not a threat to you.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.873
Please, untie us.

07:33.252 --> 07:35.220
No.
You're right.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.223
Uh, Sam, don't untie them.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.452
<i>We gotta talk.</i>

07:42.628 --> 07:44.562
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.329
Uh, I'll be right back.

07:58.311 --> 08:02.008
Where the hell have you been? Oh, well, I
had a little situation I had to deal with.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.743
You had a little situation? I have
a little situation here, Al. Yeah.

08:04.817 --> 08:09.220
I'm an escaped killer. Well, that's sort
of what I wanted to talk to you about.

08:09.288 --> 08:12.780
<i>- Do you see those two in there?
- Yeah, that's Carol Pruitt and her daughter, Becky.</i>

08:12.859 --> 08:15.453
Oh, it's so nice to be on a first-name
basis with my hostages. Yeah.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.519
I'm lettin' 'em go, Al.
No, you can't do that!

08:17.597 --> 08:21.363
Why do you keep sayin' that? Uh, 'cause
they're the only thing you got to bargain with.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.368
Bargain?
Bargain with who?

08:23.436 --> 08:28.499
<i>Leon Stiles, this is Sheriff Hoyt.</i>

08:28.574 --> 08:31.202
<i>The house is surrounded.</i>

08:31.277 --> 08:34.405
Give yourself up
before anybody else gets hurt.

08:36.682 --> 08:41.085
Cut into the phone line.
This'll give you a direct line in and out.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.250
Think he'll give himself up?

08:46.325 --> 08:49.260
I don't know.
Why don't you ask him?

08:49.328 --> 08:52.388
<i>Have it cocked and loaded.
Grimes.</i>

08:54.767 --> 08:58.760
<i>Yeah, we got all the weapons
distributed here.</i>

08:58.838 --> 09:01.306
We just got word
from the hospital.

09:03.309 --> 09:06.870
Deputy Collins
died on the operating table.

09:06.946 --> 09:09.471
<i>Keep an eye out on the roof.</i>

09:09.549 --> 09:11.483
Get my rifle out of the car.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.384
Go on. Do like I said.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.822
That's it.
What are you gonna do?

09:22.895 --> 09:26.058
I'm gonna do what I should have done in the
first place, untie those two and give myself up.

09:26.132 --> 09:29.192
No, no, no.
Sam, you can't do that!

09:29.268 --> 09:32.396
Why not?

09:32.471 --> 09:36.805
Because Hoyt will kill you
before you even get to the mailbox.

09:36.876 --> 09:39.572
Is that what happened in
the original history? Yes.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.512
He killed-Why?

09:42.582 --> 09:45.813
Well, Stiles killed Hoyt's daughter.

09:45.885 --> 09:50.584
It was a fluke kind of thing. The girl
just got in the way, and he shot her.

09:52.658 --> 09:55.456
So then I'm here to keep Stiles
from being murdered.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.860
We think so. Uh, yeah.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.023
- "We think so"? What do you mean, "We think so"?
- We think so.

10:00.099 --> 10:05.298
See, we've been kind of busy
with a-with another little problem.

10:05.371 --> 10:10.536
- What's goin' on, Al?
- I guess there's no easy way to tell you this, Sam.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.704
- What?
- He got away from us.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.550
He got away from you?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.552
Mm-hmm. What do you mean,
he got away from you?

10:20.620 --> 10:24.351
Well, he- he escaped.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.449
He escaped?
Mm-hmm.

10:30.162 --> 10:33.325
<i>How could that happen?
He escaped!</i>

10:33.399 --> 10:37.859
Wait a minute. Al, you didn't open
the waiting room door, did you?

10:37.937 --> 10:40.428
Uh
- Oh, please, tell me you did not open the waiting room door.

10:40.506 --> 10:42.633
You did, you did!
I can't believe this!

10:42.708 --> 10:45.609
<i>Well, I couldn't help it! He took us
by surprise! What do you mean, he took-</i>

10:45.678 --> 10:48.238
Somehow he got hold of a gun, and he
held the gun straight at me, like that.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.215
What could I do? I couldn't do
anything. All right. Okay, okay.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.410
He got out of
the waiting room, okay.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.011
At least he's still in the complex.

10:56.088 --> 10:58.022
Right?

10:58.090 --> 11:00.854
Uh
- I can't believe this is happening, Al.

11:00.926 --> 11:03.019
You gotta get him back!
Oh, I will.

11:03.095 --> 11:05.029
What do you mean, you will?
I will!

11:05.097 --> 11:07.531
What do you mean? You're not thinkin'
about goin' after him yourself, are you?

11:07.600 --> 11:10.467
Why not? Why not? Because he's a
cold-blooded killer, that's why not.

11:10.536 --> 11:13.835
Sam, this guy's gotta be taken
alive. And I need you here with me.

11:13.906 --> 11:18.275
Don't forget, if he dies,
you're finished.

11:22.848 --> 11:28.411
And don't worry, okay? Don't worry,
because I'm gonna leave Gooshie in charge.

11:28.487 --> 11:33.356
Gooshie?
Well, that's just perfect.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.894
Yeah. And if anything happens,
he'll be in touch with you.

11:35.961 --> 11:40.295
Ziggy is syncin' up his brain with
your brain so that you can see him.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.301
Me and Gooshie.
Yeah.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.736
In the meantime, what am I
supposed to do with those two?

11:46.806 --> 11:50.003
Well, just hang on for dear life,
but don't forget...

11:50.076 --> 11:52.977
that they're the only thing
between you and an autopsy.

11:53.045 --> 11:56.481
<i>Oh, that's gonna
be Hoyt makin' contact.</i>

11:56.549 --> 12:01.077
Now, you have to buy time for me,

12:01.153 --> 12:03.917
so he's gotta believe you're serious.

12:03.989 --> 12:06.150
<i>Meaning?</i>

12:06.225 --> 12:10.184
Well, meaning you gotta make
Hoyt believe that you're...

12:10.262 --> 12:12.822
capable of killing those people.

12:33.686 --> 12:36.154
- Yeah?
- That you, Leon?

12:36.222 --> 12:40.352
- Yeah, it's me.
- Seems like we got us a little problem here.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.724
It seems that way.

12:42.795 --> 12:45.093
You know, I got some people
in here with me.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.962
I know you do.
How are they?

12:49.068 --> 12:51.628
They're okay.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.638
<i>They're a little scared,
but they're okay.</i>

12:53.706 --> 12:56.800
Leon, we've got
the house surrounded.

12:56.876 --> 12:59.811
There's no way you can get out.

12:59.879 --> 13:04.646
Now, why don't you let those folks go
and give yourself up?

13:04.717 --> 13:07.686
Yeah, well, you know, I'd like to
do that, but I'm afraid that I can't.

13:07.753 --> 13:11.883
Now, you listen to me,
you little pissant.

13:14.593 --> 13:18.552
I don't wanna see any more
innocent people get hurt here.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.122
Well, that makes two of us.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.134
But you listen to me.

13:25.337 --> 13:29.740
You take one step toward
this house, and I'll kill 'em.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.456
You look like you're about
ready. Yeah. That's about it.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.431
Oh, did Ziggy, uh, do up that-
Profile disk.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.936
Oh, yeah. Okay, now remember,
if anything happens to me-

13:58.003 --> 14:00.938
I'm to immediately contact
Dr. Beckett. That's right.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.702
Now, I should have a backup
hand-link. Backup hand-link.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.802
Oh, thanks. Okay, good.
Now, uh-

14:06.879 --> 14:10.007
All right now.
All I have to do is find him.

14:10.082 --> 14:12.312
I don't foresee that
as a major problem.

14:12.384 --> 14:15.581
What do you mean? Well, you remember
last year when I had my car stolen?

14:15.654 --> 14:19.818
So? So, I took your advice and had one
of those tracking devices installed.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.053
Since it's hooked into
a central monitoring station,

14:22.127 --> 14:26.223
I had Ziggy access the system and
redirect the signal through the hand-link.

14:26.298 --> 14:29.392
Do you mean I can find Stiles
using the hand-link?

14:29.468 --> 14:32.460
I believe that is the general idea.
Gooshie. Gooshie!

14:32.538 --> 14:34.836
That's fantastic!
That's great!

14:34.907 --> 14:38.707
Gooshie, I could kiss you,
if you didn't have bad breath.

14:38.777 --> 14:41.541
I am touched.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.082
Admiral, are you sure
this is what you want to do?

14:44.149 --> 14:48.813
For five years I've been watchin' Sam
Beckett risk his life for total strangers.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.083
Think about it.

14:51.156 --> 14:55.786
I wanna explain to you
why I said what I did.

14:55.861 --> 14:57.988
<i>I didn't mean it, okay?</i>

14:58.063 --> 15:01.396
I was just, uh-
I was just tryin' to buy some time.

15:01.467 --> 15:04.834
- What kind of man are you?
- What?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.498
How could you do the things
they said you did?

15:07.573 --> 15:10.542
<i>How could you murder
those women?</i>

15:12.811 --> 15:16.144
I didn't, okay?

15:16.215 --> 15:18.274
I am not a killer.

15:18.350 --> 15:22.116
Then let us go.

15:22.187 --> 15:25.054
I can't.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.115
Not yet anyway.

15:27.192 --> 15:32.129
- Why do you hate us?
- I don't hate you at all.

15:32.197 --> 15:34.188
<i>Look, I know you're scared.</i>

15:34.266 --> 15:39.670
I'd be scared if I were you too.
But there's an explanation for all this.

15:39.738 --> 15:42.434
What kind of explanation?

15:44.176 --> 15:46.804
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try us.

15:52.084 --> 15:54.018
Okay.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.283
I don't expect you to believe
everything I'm about to tell you.

15:58.357 --> 16:03.488
I mean, I'm the one tellin' you, and
sometimes I have trouble believin' it myself.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.134
My name isn't Stiles.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.230
It's Beckett.
Sam Beckett.

16:14.306 --> 16:19.539
In 1995, I created a secret
government project called Quantum Leap.

16:19.611 --> 16:22.011
Now, I won't bother explaining
to you how it works,

16:22.081 --> 16:27.678
but the result was the ability to travel in time-
to inhabit other people's lives.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.922
And now you're here?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.187
And now I'm here.

16:35.260 --> 16:38.423
How come you look like
the man on television?

16:38.497 --> 16:42.126
When I leap,
you see the person I've leapt into.

16:42.201 --> 16:45.796
But when I leap,
it's my body that's here.

16:45.871 --> 16:49.363
It's my spirit.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.375
And the real Leon Stiles spirit is-

16:51.443 --> 16:54.378
In the future. See, and that's
the problem, because he escaped,

16:54.446 --> 16:57.108
and my friend is looking for him
to bring him back.

16:57.182 --> 17:01.346
I was gonna give myself up, but in the original
history, Stiles was shot when he surrendered.

17:01.420 --> 17:05.753
That's why I can't let you go. You're the only
thing keeping me alive until my friend comes back.

17:09.962 --> 17:13.921
Do you have any idea
what that sounds like?

17:16.502 --> 17:19.368
Yeah.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.531
Yeah, I'm afraid I do.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.940
<i>How long you plan to wait?</i>

17:28.012 --> 17:31.005
He ain't goin' anywhere.

17:31.083 --> 17:34.712
Yeah, well, maybe we oughta
try to negotiate with him.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.585
<i>Does he see anything else?</i>

17:37.656 --> 17:41.649
You don't negotiate with a rabid dog.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.525
Trap 'im, kill 'im and bury 'im.

17:46.899 --> 17:52.394
Look, Sheriff, are you sure you don't
want me and the boys to handle this?

17:52.471 --> 17:55.907
Like you say,
he ain't goin' nowhere.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.067
Do you think
I can't handle myself?

17:58.143 --> 18:00.373
No, that isn't it.

18:03.382 --> 18:07.284
I just think you've had
a rough time of it since-

18:07.352 --> 18:09.980
Look, John,

18:10.055 --> 18:13.616
I just hate to see you do anything
to ruin a fine career, that's all.

18:16.228 --> 18:19.220
Appreciate your concern.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.734
That man in there
killed my daughter.

18:22.801 --> 18:25.702
I fully intend
to return the favor.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.475
You promise you won't
try and escape?

18:37.549 --> 18:41.610
I'm not goin' anywhere
without her.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.588
Look, I know you think
I'm this dangerous person,

18:44.656 --> 18:47.716
but I'm not gonna hurt you.

18:47.793 --> 18:51.957
Either one of you.
Then why won't you let us go?

18:52.030 --> 18:55.659
I told you already.
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

18:55.734 --> 18:59.067
You're stuck here till your friend
from the future gets back.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.900
Guess I asked for that.

19:07.513 --> 19:10.914
"Human Anatomy"?
You always read textbooks?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.816
When I'm preparing for finals.
Finals?

19:13.886 --> 19:16.218
Medical school.
You're a med student?

19:16.288 --> 19:20.281
You surprised? No.
Well, maybe a little.

19:20.359 --> 19:24.352
I mean, you're not exactly-
What, a cheerleader?

19:24.429 --> 19:29.093
Look, just because you're over 21,
doesn't mean your life is over.

19:31.403 --> 19:33.394
What took you so long
to get started?

19:36.341 --> 19:39.538
My ex-husband decided
it was more important...

19:39.611 --> 19:42.842
that I wait tables
while he got his degree first.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.941
Then when he got what he wanted,
that was that.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.715
So this is your form of revenge,
kind of beatin' him at his own game?

19:49.788 --> 19:52.120
This has nothing to do with revenge.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.024
I spent that anger a long time ago.

19:55.093 --> 19:59.291
This is about me... and Becky.

20:04.236 --> 20:07.569
Sure brings back memories.
Memories?

20:09.508 --> 20:11.874
<i>Yeah. Um-</i>

20:13.979 --> 20:15.913
I'm a doctor.

20:19.084 --> 20:22.451
Of course you are.
No, really, I am.

20:22.521 --> 20:25.684
Look, I hate to step
all over your fantasy life,

20:25.757 --> 20:28.726
but the television
said you were illiterate.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.989
The television said
Leon Stiles was illiterate.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.258
Why are you doing this?

20:35.834 --> 20:37.768
Here.
What?

20:37.836 --> 20:40.168
Take this. It's proof.
That's okay.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.400
Go on. I want you
to ask me anything in there.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.942
Aren't you a little curious?

20:52.117 --> 20:56.315
Respiratory system.
Perfect.

20:56.388 --> 20:59.152
This is ridiculous.
Come on, come on, come on.

21:08.133 --> 21:12.467
The lungs consist of five lobes.
Name them.

21:12.537 --> 21:15.631
Right upper, right middle,
right lower, left upper, left lower.

21:18.043 --> 21:21.171
That's right.
Yeah.

21:21.246 --> 21:24.704
Go ahead, ask me something
else. Somethin' harder.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.148
Okay, here's one.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.387
Name the bones of the foot.

21:36.461 --> 21:40.795
Phalanges, metatarsals, cuneiforms,
navicular, cuboid, talus and calcaneus.

21:40.866 --> 21:42.800
I can spell them for you
if you'd like.

21:46.505 --> 21:49.167
- You memorized it.
- I just had the book for a couple of minutes.

21:49.241 --> 21:52.540
It's possible. When was the last time
you met an illiterate speed-reader?

21:54.112 --> 21:56.342
<i>Dr. Beckett.</i>

21:56.415 --> 21:58.007
- Gooshie?
- What?

21:58.083 --> 22:00.608
He's not a what, he's a who.
Your friend from the future?

22:00.686 --> 22:02.881
One of them. Oh, great.
Now there are two of them?

22:02.954 --> 22:05.650
Gooshie, why are you
fading in and out like that?

22:05.724 --> 22:08.818
I must not be tuned into your
exact brain wave. And your voice is-

22:08.894 --> 22:11.385
Ziggy did kind of a rush job.
What are you doin' here?

22:11.463 --> 22:14.330
Admiral Calavicci told me to let you know
if Ziggy came up with any new information.

22:14.399 --> 22:17.027
<i>Did she?</i>

22:17.102 --> 22:22.062
- Well, she said by not surrendering, you've changed history.
- For the better, I hope.

22:22.140 --> 22:24.335
- In a way.
- Gooshie.

22:24.409 --> 22:28.743
Now instead of getting shot outside
the house, you get shot inside.

22:32.918 --> 22:35.443
Exactly 91 minutes from now,

22:35.520 --> 22:39.047
Sheriff Hoyt is going to storm
this house and kill you.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.217
I'm afraid there's more.

22:41.293 --> 22:44.387
During the shooting,

22:44.463 --> 22:46.863
the little girl gets caught
in the cross fire.

22:48.667 --> 22:51.397
- Becky?
- Becky? What about her?

22:51.470 --> 22:53.961
Dr. Beckett,

22:54.039 --> 22:56.473
<i>she's gonna be killed.</i>

23:13.191 --> 23:15.125
Good evening, Admiral.

23:15.193 --> 23:18.526
<i>Before we begin the profile scan,
I'd like to take this opportunity...</i>

23:18.597 --> 23:22.795
<i>to express my admiration for your
selfless attempt to rescue Dr. Beckett.</i>

23:22.868 --> 23:26.133
<i>It is a fitting testimony to the
bonding which humans tend to display-</i>

23:26.204 --> 23:28.172
Yeah, yeah.
Toward others of their species.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.643
<i>Unfortunately, I project
a less than 34% chance of success.</i>

23:32.711 --> 23:35.111
Well, thanks for
the vote of confidence.

23:35.180 --> 23:38.149
Begin profile.

23:38.216 --> 23:41.845
The target,
Leon Randolph Stiles, age 26.

23:41.920 --> 23:45.253
Abandoned at birth,
was raised in a series of foster homes.

23:45.323 --> 23:47.917
First arrested at age 17 for assault.

23:47.993 --> 23:51.121
Served two years in the Hamilton
Youth Detention Facility.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.687
After being released,
he relocated to Texas.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.699
He eventually became
the main suspect...

23:55.767 --> 23:58.361
in a series of murders
involving prostitutes.

23:58.437 --> 24:02.601
He was finally captured after abducting
and murdering a young local woman.

24:02.674 --> 24:06.770
After running all available data,
it is my belief that the target, Stiles,

24:06.845 --> 24:11.282
will attempt to contact a female that
matches the profiles of previous victims.

24:11.349 --> 24:15.877
I advise extreme caution in attempting
apprehension. Good luck, Admiral.

24:15.954 --> 24:20.721
Uh, thanks. I think
I'll probably need a little luck.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.005
<i>Why won't you answer me?</i>

24:40.078 --> 24:42.603
Why did you say her name
like that?

24:42.681 --> 24:44.615
Is there any way
you could have made a mistake?

24:44.683 --> 24:47.880
I checked it a dozen times.
What are you gonna do?

24:47.953 --> 24:49.887
Tell me.

24:51.389 --> 24:54.790
You better wake her up.
No.

24:56.628 --> 24:59.222
Don't you touch her! Look,
I'm not gonna hurt her, okay?

24:59.297 --> 25:01.697
Then what are you doing? I'm just
- I'm trying to save her life.

25:01.766 --> 25:04.360
How?
By letting her go.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.163
Why?

25:12.611 --> 25:14.545
Does it matter?

25:19.284 --> 25:21.548
- Yeah?
- Let me talk to Hoyt.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.189
Wants to talk to you.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.558
This is Hoyt.

25:35.634 --> 25:39.070
- Yeah, look, I wanna make a deal.
- I'm listenin'.

25:39.137 --> 25:41.605
I give you the little girl, you
promise not to make a move on me.

25:45.911 --> 25:48.072
We got a deal?

25:50.615 --> 25:53.778
Yeah. We got a deal.

25:53.852 --> 25:56.116
Good.

25:56.187 --> 25:58.485
<i>Good.
I'll send her out in five minutes.</i>

26:02.794 --> 26:06.594
Here you go.
Why do I have to wear this?

26:06.665 --> 26:10.396
Because I'm the mother,
and I say so.

26:10.468 --> 26:12.868
I want you to come with me.

26:12.938 --> 26:16.135
I know you do.

26:16.207 --> 26:18.334
Is he gonna hurt you?

26:23.615 --> 26:27.142
You are so pretty.

26:27.218 --> 26:29.778
Have I ever told you
how pretty I think you are?

26:32.991 --> 26:35.459
Now you be brave, all right?

26:36.461 --> 26:38.952
I love you.

26:39.030 --> 26:42.522
Oh, I love you too, sweetheart.

26:42.601 --> 26:47.300
I love you more than anything
in this whole world.

26:47.372 --> 26:49.533
It's time.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.214
Okay.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.843
You go on now.

27:01.853 --> 27:04.014
I'll be out before you know it.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.893
<i>Okay, Becky,
you just walk to me now.</i>

27:23.375 --> 27:25.809
I need to use the bathroom.

27:32.951 --> 27:37.251
At least the little
girl's safe, right? Yeah.

27:40.358 --> 27:43.953
This is amazing.
What's that?

27:44.996 --> 27:50.559
Well, according to this, there's a
91.6% chance you should be leaping.

27:50.635 --> 27:55.072
Apparently saving the little girl
accomplished your mission. Except-

27:55.140 --> 27:59.702
Except I can't leap, because we
don't have Stiles in the waiting room.

27:59.778 --> 28:02.542
Time and space can be a bitch.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.708
Uh-oh.

28:05.784 --> 28:09.413
"Uh-oh," what? Nothin'.
It must be a loose circuit.

28:09.487 --> 28:11.421
Gooshie.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.357
According to this...

28:16.428 --> 28:18.828
you still get killed by Hoyt.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.169
He lied to me.

28:27.505 --> 28:30.633
How much time do I have?

28:30.709 --> 28:33.542
Less than an hour. All right, all
right, all right. You find Al, okay?

28:33.611 --> 28:37.047
You tell him what happened. You tell him he's
gotta have Stiles in the waiting room by midnight.

28:40.018 --> 28:42.043
Or else...

28:43.822 --> 28:45.847
I'm a dead man.

28:56.835 --> 29:02.102
<i>The right lane is for
electromagnetic vehicles only.</i>

29:09.581 --> 29:13.017
Hey, baby, pull that thing
on in here. Come on.

29:17.555 --> 29:19.955
You look lost.

29:21.526 --> 29:23.494
What's that you got
on your face?

29:23.561 --> 29:26.826
Body paint. It's edible.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.996
You got a place?

29:32.070 --> 29:35.301
Across the street.
It'll cost you 200.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.905
Are you interested?

29:41.980 --> 29:44.210
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm interested.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.217
Well, come on then.
Let's do it.

29:54.325 --> 29:56.384
Come on, baby.
Time is money.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.568
<i>Admiral.</i>

30:15.146 --> 30:17.910
<i>Who said that?
It's me, Gooshie.</i>

30:17.982 --> 30:20.450
Gooshie?
Where are you?

30:20.518 --> 30:23.612
<i>I'm right in front of you.
Can't you see me?</i>

30:23.688 --> 30:26.156
If I could see you,
would I be talkin' to the sidewalk?

30:26.224 --> 30:29.625
<i>I guess Ziggy didn't do a very goodjob
of syncing our brain waves.</i>

30:29.694 --> 30:32.492
I'll take that as a compliment.
What are you doin' here?

30:32.564 --> 30:35.499
<i>Dr. Beckett sent me.
Is he all right?</i>

30:35.567 --> 30:39.059
<i>Well, for the time being.
"Time being"?</i>

30:40.271 --> 30:43.570
He changed history, didn't he?
Uh, what's gonna happen?

30:43.641 --> 30:45.575
<i>Sheriff Hoyt's gonna kill him.
When?</i>

30:45.643 --> 30:48.840
<i>Less than an hour from now.
Ziggy says the only chance he has...</i>

30:48.913 --> 30:52.576
<i>is if you can get Stiles back to
the waiting room before it happens.</i>

30:52.650 --> 30:55.278
Lights.

30:55.353 --> 30:59.551
<i>Hmm, lower.
A little lower.</i>

31:01.292 --> 31:03.920
Hmm. There.

31:03.995 --> 31:07.522
Come on in.
I won't bite.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.591
Unless you're into that kind of thing.

31:10.668 --> 31:12.829
How'd you do that?
Do what?

31:12.904 --> 31:15.498
With the lights.
Oh.

31:15.573 --> 31:20.340
It was magic!

31:21.346 --> 31:23.837
How about a drink?
Yeah. Sure.

31:25.316 --> 31:28.342
Bar.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.314
I haven't seen you
around here before.

31:38.062 --> 31:41.657
Say, I like your outfit.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.567
I used to have a pair of pajamas
like that when I was a kid,

31:45.637 --> 31:49.368
only they had feet in them.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.307
Here you go.

31:53.378 --> 31:57.940
Wow.
You do like to party, don't you?

31:58.016 --> 32:03.648
So, what are you into?
Talk? Games?

32:03.721 --> 32:07.020
Movies?

32:08.226 --> 32:10.490
Movies.
I knew it.

32:10.561 --> 32:13.530
Guys love movies.
Video!

32:13.598 --> 32:17.830
You're gonna love this.

32:17.902 --> 32:21.235
What's that?
What do you think it is?

32:21.306 --> 32:23.638
Don't play games with me, whore.
Just tell me what it is!

32:23.708 --> 32:27.610
It's a video screen.
You been livin' in a cave or somethin'?

32:29.948 --> 32:31.882
Hey! I wanna know what
the hell is goin' on here.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.180
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What year is it?

32:34.252 --> 32:36.686
- What?
- The year! Just tell me what year it is!

32:36.754 --> 32:40.121
- It's 1999.
- Don't lie to me.

32:40.191 --> 32:42.659
I think you're lyin' to me. Why is
it you whores are all liars, huh?

32:42.727 --> 32:44.991
- No, I'm not!
- All right, Leon. Hold it.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.361
- You drop it, or I'll kill her!
- Hold it.

32:47.432 --> 32:48.626
Help me.
Shut up!

32:48.700 --> 32:51.567
Leon, I know you're confused.

32:51.636 --> 32:55.197
But the truth is,
you don't belong here.

32:55.273 --> 32:57.207
What is this, some kind
of dream or something?

32:57.275 --> 33:00.244
No, it's not a, dream.
I came to take you back, Leon.

33:00.311 --> 33:03.838
Back to where?
Back to 1958.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.950
There was a mix-up
in an experiment,

33:08.019 --> 33:10.749
and accidentally you traveled
40 years into the future.

33:10.822 --> 33:14.314
You traded places with a friend
of mine who's stuck back in '58.

33:14.392 --> 33:17.384
You think I'm stupid?
Would I make up a story like this?

33:17.462 --> 33:21.523
People don't just jump
into other people's lives.

33:21.599 --> 33:23.692
Well, my friend does,
and I'll prove it to you.

33:23.768 --> 33:25.895
Uh, cutie, is there a mirror
here somewhere?

33:25.970 --> 33:29.030
Mm-hmm. Mirror.

33:31.142 --> 33:33.303
Okay.

33:33.378 --> 33:37.314
Now, I'll tell you what, Leon.
Just check out your reflection in there.

33:40.585 --> 33:43.679
I don't believe this.
This can't be happenin'!

33:43.755 --> 33:46.553
Yeah, well, it's real.
And you gotta believe it.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.052
You're in my head.

33:50.128 --> 33:52.460
You ain't real!
None of you's real!

33:57.101 --> 34:00.298
No!

34:29.833 --> 34:31.995
- I gotta get back.
- You killed him.

34:35.806 --> 34:38.469
You, stand up.

34:40.178 --> 34:42.578
Go on. That's it.
That's it.

34:44.348 --> 34:46.282
Don't look at me.
Close your eyes.

34:51.188 --> 34:53.589
Don't shoot.
Shh.

34:55.525 --> 34:57.460
Bang.

35:03.534 --> 35:06.298
Oh, my God.

35:06.370 --> 35:08.463
I thought you were dead.

35:08.539 --> 35:11.872
No, I'm not dead.

35:14.112 --> 35:18.913
What's that?
That's a bulletproof vest.

35:18.983 --> 35:21.577
And never track
a psychotic killer without one.

35:21.652 --> 35:23.984
Hey, is that guy
from another planet, or what?

35:24.055 --> 35:27.923
Mostly "or what. "
Help me up, will ya'?

35:30.061 --> 35:32.120
Oh, geez, where is he?

35:32.196 --> 35:34.130
Where is he?
Who cares?

35:38.236 --> 35:40.170
Where's my hand-link?
Your what?

35:40.238 --> 35:42.502
Where's my
- It's a little, colorful, stupid thing. That flashing gizmo?

35:42.573 --> 35:44.507
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he took it.

35:44.575 --> 35:46.736
He said something about getting back,
and then he split.

35:46.811 --> 35:50.247
I don't know where he went.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.805
Say, take it easy.
You know, you should get to a hospital.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.351
Or I could take care of you.

35:57.555 --> 36:01.116
It's tempting,
but I don't have time.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.893
<i>Honey, I'm gonna need to
ask you some questions.</i>

36:11.969 --> 36:14.904
Are you gonna
get my mommy back?

36:14.972 --> 36:18.430
We're gonna try.
But I'll need your help.

36:18.509 --> 36:21.273
Do you think
you can help me?

36:22.613 --> 36:24.774
Yes.
Good.

36:24.849 --> 36:29.377
Now, I need you to tell me
where Mr. Stiles is keeping your mother.

36:29.453 --> 36:31.921
Mr. Beckett.
What?

36:31.989 --> 36:35.755
His name is Sam Beckett.
Mr. Stiles is in the future.

36:38.996 --> 36:41.965
What do you mean,
he's in the future?

36:42.033 --> 36:46.697
Mr. Beckett traveled in time
and switched places with him.

36:46.771 --> 36:49.604
Now he's here,
and Mr. Stiles is there.

36:49.674 --> 36:52.108
Did he tell you that?

36:52.176 --> 36:53.939
Yes.

36:54.011 --> 36:56.741
Darlin',

36:56.814 --> 37:01.683
where is, uh, Mr. Beckett
holding your mother?

37:01.752 --> 37:05.745
In the living room.
Good girl.

37:05.823 --> 37:08.053
You've been a big help.

37:08.125 --> 37:11.561
Now, if you just sit here for
a little bit, I'll be right back.

37:17.802 --> 37:21.397
What the hell was that all about?
He's startin' to fall apart.

37:21.472 --> 37:23.406
We haven't got much time left.

37:23.474 --> 37:26.568
Maybe we oughta try and call him again, calm him
- No!

37:26.644 --> 37:29.112
It's too late for that.

37:29.180 --> 37:32.843
It's time to end this
once and for all.

37:37.388 --> 37:39.618
What's it like?
It?

37:39.690 --> 37:41.920
The future.

37:46.664 --> 37:48.859
You believe what I said?

37:49.867 --> 37:52.927
I don't know what I believe.

37:53.004 --> 37:56.030
It's like everything's backwards.

37:56.107 --> 37:59.474
I mean, you break into my house
and you terrorize us.

38:00.911 --> 38:03.379
<i>I see the television,
the things they say about you,</i>

38:03.447 --> 38:05.813
then you turn around
and you let Becky go.

38:06.884 --> 38:08.818
<i>You're supposed to be illiterate,</i>

38:08.886 --> 38:11.514
but you know more
than most of my professors.

38:11.589 --> 38:14.285
It's like nothin' makes
any sense anymore.

38:14.358 --> 38:17.794
Welcome to my world.

38:17.862 --> 38:21.263
What's gonna happen?

38:25.569 --> 38:28.231
There's a man out there.
He's gonna kill me.

38:30.341 --> 38:35.074
He's gonna come in here
and... shoot me. Why?

38:36.314 --> 38:38.874
Because Stiles
killed his daughter.

38:41.352 --> 38:43.479
When will it happen?

38:48.059 --> 38:50.186
Soon.

38:57.735 --> 39:00.670
Oh!
Oh, you ain't goin' nowhere.

39:00.738 --> 39:04.105
I'm the one goin' somewhere, 'cause you're
gonna steer me back where I came from, right?

39:04.175 --> 39:07.576
L- I can't do that.
I think you're lyin' to me.

39:07.645 --> 39:11.581
Don't get me wrong, I mean, I'd love to
accommodate you, but it doesn't work that way.

39:11.649 --> 39:15.107
We don't have control over it.
Well, who does?

39:15.186 --> 39:19.247
Well, that kind of depends on your point
of view. Call yourself a religious man?

39:20.591 --> 39:23.458
<i>Probably not.</i>

39:23.527 --> 39:25.893
Okay, now you're lyin' to me.

39:25.963 --> 39:29.592
You take me back to where
I came from right now,

39:29.667 --> 39:31.601
or I'll kill you.

39:31.669 --> 39:34.433
Well, you're just gonna
have to kill me then.

39:35.339 --> 39:38.797
<i>Leon! Get outta there, Gooshie!</i>

39:43.514 --> 39:45.448
Who are you?

39:53.257 --> 39:55.657
Okay, Gooshie.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.335
Just can't leave you alone
for a minute, can I, Gooshie?

40:06.404 --> 40:08.395
Admiral, what happened?

40:08.472 --> 40:13.136
Uh, nothin'. I just, uh
- I zigged when I shoulda zagged, that's all.

40:13.210 --> 40:15.405
Come on. We gotta get him
into the waiting room.

40:15.479 --> 40:17.470
We only got a couple of minutes
to get Sam back.

40:17.548 --> 40:20.016
Corporal, help us out.
We're gonna drag him in there.

40:28.359 --> 40:31.590
Come on.
Where are we goin'?

40:31.662 --> 40:34.722
I'm not goin' anywhere, you are.
What about you?

40:36.267 --> 40:38.201
Don't worry about me.
Wait.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.203
He's comin', isn't he?

40:42.306 --> 40:44.536
Yeah, yeah, he's comin'.

40:44.608 --> 40:48.305
Well, what about your friend?

40:48.379 --> 40:51.314
<i>I guess my friend didn't make it.
Guess again.</i>

40:51.382 --> 40:55.011
Al!
Al, wh-what's wrong?

40:55.085 --> 40:57.519
Are you all right? What are you
- Oh, yeah. Oh, it's nothin'.

40:57.588 --> 41:00.648
<i>Just a couple of nights in bed
with a hot nurse. I'll be fine.</i>

41:00.724 --> 41:04.057
I take it that you found Stiles? Yeah.
Oh, yeah. We kind of ran into each other.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.187
Where is he?
Oh, Sam,

41:06.263 --> 41:08.197
I nailed him with a tranquilizer
dart, right in the neck.

41:08.265 --> 41:11.860
That's great, that's great. Where
is he? Well, he's sleepin' like a-

41:11.936 --> 41:13.369
Where?
In the waiting room.

41:13.437 --> 41:16.133
- In the waiting room! That's great.
- What? What's great?

41:16.207 --> 41:18.141
He got him!
He's got him in the waiting room too.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.541
Oh. Oh, good!
In the waiting room. Yes.

41:20.611 --> 41:24.980
You told her who you really are? It's a long
story, and I'm runnin' outta time here, okay?

41:25.049 --> 41:27.540
I mean, I should be
leaping now, right? Because I'm-

41:27.618 --> 41:29.552
Anytime. Yeah, yeah.
Anytime.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.987
Look, I am really sorry
that you had to go through this,

41:33.057 --> 41:35.491
and I'm sorry that your little
girl had to go through this.

41:35.559 --> 41:39.325
And for whatever it's worth, I think
you're gonna make a terrific doctor.

41:41.398 --> 41:43.332
Thank you.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.595
You're welcome.

41:47.872 --> 41:51.330
Okay.
Okay, I'm ready.

41:52.910 --> 41:55.538
Okay. He's ready.

41:58.582 --> 42:00.573
- What's the matter?
- I'm not leaping, that's what's the matter.

42:00.651 --> 42:03.176
Why am I not leaping?
I don't know.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.415
You don't know? You gotta know,
Al! I'm running out of time.

42:05.489 --> 42:08.253
Well, this thing-

42:14.331 --> 42:16.697
Don't move!

42:16.767 --> 42:20.897
Keep your hands where I can see
'em, Stiles. You all right, miss?

42:20.971 --> 42:23.599
<i>Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
That's good.</i>

42:23.674 --> 42:29.271
Why don't you step over here
and let Deputy Grimes take you out.

42:29.346 --> 42:31.906
- Come along with me.
- Sam, if she leaves, you're dead.

42:33.517 --> 42:37.578
- What about him?
- Don't you worry. I'll take care of him.

42:37.655 --> 42:39.589
You go on now.

42:41.358 --> 42:43.588
No.

42:44.862 --> 42:47.729
- What'd you say?
- Maybe you should do what he says.

42:47.798 --> 42:51.632
- Sam, no!
- I'm not leaving. Not alone, I'm not.

42:54.305 --> 42:59.265
This man is a cold-blooded killer.

43:02.146 --> 43:04.774
But you're not.

43:07.418 --> 43:12.446
You're a daddy
who misses his daughter.

43:12.523 --> 43:15.822
Be remembered for that, not this.

43:40.684 --> 43:42.652
Cuff the prisoner.

43:50.194 --> 43:52.628
I'm goin' home.

43:55.265 --> 43:58.462
Uh, yeah, Sam, that was it.
That's why you didn't leap.

43:58.535 --> 44:01.971
You had to stop Hoyt from killing
Stiles and ruining his life.

44:02.039 --> 44:04.166
Thank you.

44:04.241 --> 44:06.641
For what?
Believing me.

44:06.710 --> 44:08.644
Let's go.

44:12.316 --> 44:14.284
I'm ready to go now.

44:21.659 --> 44:25.322
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

44:31.235 --> 44:33.169
Can you hear me?

44:35.673 --> 44:37.868
Who are you?

44:40.744 --> 44:44.236
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
