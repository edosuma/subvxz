WEBVTT

00:34.822 --> 00:36.355
Can I get a table?

00:36.381 --> 00:39.460
Yeah, sure. Just we're
closing soon, all right?

00:39.461 --> 00:41.850
You're Roscoe, right?

00:43.526 --> 00:47.972
- Yeah, that's right. Who's asking?
- No one. I just heard all about you.

00:47.973 --> 00:51.622
A real pool shark. All
those tournaments you won.

00:52.581 --> 00:56.411
Why don't you go to table 12, seems
like it's racked already. Go ahead.

00:56.964 --> 01:00.322
Nah. Don't worry about it.
Just get me on the way back.

01:00.323 --> 01:01.634
Okay.

01:01.635 --> 01:05.397
'Cause I am a part of you

01:05.890 --> 01:07.682
'Cause I live

01:07.683 --> 01:11.447
The life that you wanted to

01:12.035 --> 01:15.617
You know what you swear

01:15.618 --> 01:20.855
In air, a tribulation

01:22.530 --> 01:26.368
And I held you close

01:26.369 --> 01:31.936
Gathering all your faces...

01:31.937 --> 01:34.016
You know, you're not bad.
I've been watching you.

01:34.017 --> 01:36.606
- Can you play one game?
- I had such a long day.

01:36.607 --> 01:39.134
- I gotta get going, man.
- How about 300?

01:39.135 --> 01:41.677
That make you stay a little longer?

01:42.688 --> 01:44.564
A little longer?

01:45.215 --> 01:48.125
It's about all it's
gonna take, kid.

01:48.126 --> 01:50.930
- Kid?
- Rack 'em up.

01:54.078 --> 01:59.434
'Cause I am a part of you

01:59.934 --> 02:01.564
'Cause I live

02:01.565 --> 02:04.444
The life that you wanted to...

02:04.445 --> 02:05.993
Not bad.

02:08.092 --> 02:10.715
"Not bad"? I just smoked you, kid.

02:10.716 --> 02:11.931
Again with the "kid."

02:11.932 --> 02:15.117
I only call people I like "kid."

02:22.331 --> 02:23.450
Remember your friend Angel?

02:23.451 --> 02:26.105
Your boy you put away?
Well, he says hello.

02:26.106 --> 02:29.455
What do you want from me?

02:41.113 --> 02:42.648
This way I don't forget you.

02:42.649 --> 02:45.256
Make shit sure not to
forget me, douchebag.

02:47.608 --> 02:49.191
This one's for me.

02:52.760 --> 02:56.086
Rats... I got no use for them.

02:56.087 --> 02:59.557
Who does? Who does but the feds?

03:01.783 --> 03:03.318
If I had it my way,

03:03.319 --> 03:06.701
every one of them
would burn in hell.

03:24.342 --> 03:26.035
There is no rhyme

03:26.036 --> 03:28.467
I want to watch it burn

03:28.468 --> 03:30.675
There is no reason

03:30.676 --> 03:32.403
No lesson learned

03:32.404 --> 03:34.356
Melting glass

03:34.357 --> 03:36.242
Melting bone

03:36.243 --> 03:40.563
Bringing death to your happy home

03:40.564 --> 03:44.307
I look like you, the perfect crime

03:44.308 --> 03:48.305
There will be no
savior from the flame

03:48.306 --> 03:50.481
I want to watch

03:50.482 --> 03:55.042
The world burn

03:55.761 --> 03:57.360
And laugh while

03:57.361 --> 04:02.160
I fan the flames

04:02.161 --> 04:09.154
I want to watch the world burn

04:09.873 --> 04:12.623
And fan the flames

04:12.624 --> 04:17.118
With gasoline.

04:39.533 --> 04:41.856
What a shame.

04:47.692 --> 04:49.771
Fucking shame.

04:49.772 --> 04:54.431
I'm sorry, Dad. I know it hurts.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.226
Think I'll just stick around
here for a while, okay?

05:08.394 --> 05:10.652
The life.

05:11.530 --> 05:13.930
You know what I'm talking about.

05:13.931 --> 05:16.968
Either the feds catch up to you
when you wind up behind the wall

05:16.969 --> 05:19.816
or your own kind turns on you.

05:19.817 --> 05:21.896
Maybe you even wind
up under the ground

05:21.897 --> 05:24.385
like some of these poor bastards.

05:26.856 --> 05:29.529
I thought it could
be different for me.

05:30.376 --> 05:32.391
But I was wrong.

05:32.392 --> 05:34.301
Dead wrong.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.430
Russo.

05:43.431 --> 05:46.309
Just watching Mr. Baldano & Sons.

05:46.310 --> 05:50.227
Yeah. Same routine, different day.

05:51.334 --> 05:54.268
You gotta try and let go.

05:54.694 --> 05:57.268
Stop blaming yourself.

05:57.893 --> 06:00.315
It's not your fault.

06:01.222 --> 06:04.420
You did everything
you possibly could do.

06:04.421 --> 06:07.299
With a son like that,
he's gotta be dirty.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.091
I can feel it in my bones.

06:09.092 --> 06:11.896
I wanna nail that son of a bitch.

06:27.650 --> 06:29.217
I know, Angela.

06:29.218 --> 06:31.969
I know. I know he
doesn't like surprises,

06:31.970 --> 06:35.008
but I got this big welcome-home
dinner planned for him at the house.

06:35.009 --> 06:38.176
I just... I want things to get
off to a good start, you know?

06:38.177 --> 06:41.046
A new beginning for him.
It would be really nice.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.879
It's just time he came and
worked for his father, okay?

06:50.880 --> 06:54.328
I mean, Joseph's really got
his heart set on it this time.

06:55.423 --> 06:58.773
And I think Bobby could really
do all right for himself.

06:59.295 --> 07:00.894
Legitimately.

07:00.895 --> 07:03.006
What, no luggage?

07:03.007 --> 07:05.534
Where do you think
I was, on vacation?

07:05.535 --> 07:07.581
I want nothing from
over that bridge.

07:07.582 --> 07:09.277
Come here, you crazy bastard.

07:09.278 --> 07:10.493
Welcome back.

07:10.494 --> 07:12.523
We missed you.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.962
Where's your brother?

07:33.021 --> 07:35.659
Bobby Baldano.

07:36.283 --> 07:38.970
Oh, it's good to see
you, you son of a gun.

07:38.971 --> 07:40.794
- How you doing, Lenny?
- Good good.

07:40.795 --> 07:42.554
I knew you'd make
me your first stop.

07:42.555 --> 07:44.890
- You know that.
- You look a little thirsty.

07:44.891 --> 07:47.001
Let me get you a nice cold one.

07:47.002 --> 07:49.741
- I'm gonna join you.
- Here's that.

07:50.202 --> 07:51.193
All right.

07:51.194 --> 07:54.576
- Salute.
- Benza salute. Chin down.

07:55.961 --> 07:59.832
- Hey, Big Al, Look who's here.
- Hey, Bobby.

07:59.833 --> 08:02.072
- How you doing, Al?
- When you'd get out?

08:02.073 --> 08:04.248
- This morning.
- This morning?

08:04.249 --> 08:06.551
- You're still around?
- Hey, where am I gonna go?

08:06.552 --> 08:09.047
That's good. 'Cause
now that I'm out,

08:09.048 --> 08:10.967
I might call on you for something.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.997
You still got my number, right?

08:13.720 --> 08:15.990
Right here.

08:15.991 --> 08:18.134
Lenny, buy him a drink.

08:18.135 --> 08:20.246
Get me a Captain and ginger too.

08:20.247 --> 08:22.358
- Where's all the girls?
- Don't worry about the girls.

08:22.359 --> 08:24.246
He's just with the
boys having a drink.

08:24.247 --> 08:26.549
He's gonna be here. It's
his first day. Come on.

08:26.550 --> 08:28.677
He'll be back.

08:33.174 --> 08:35.764
Wait. What are you all doing?

08:35.765 --> 08:38.996
Let's just wait a couple of
minutes for Bobby to get home

08:38.996 --> 08:42.004
and then we'll all eat
together like we used to.

08:42.005 --> 08:44.244
I mean, is that
too much to ask for?

08:44.245 --> 08:46.437
Anyways, salute again.

08:46.868 --> 08:50.003
- Hey hey hey, look who's here.
- Good, plenty of money.

08:50.004 --> 08:52.514
Hey, what's up?

08:53.108 --> 08:55.878
Here come... the broads
come and you clam up.

08:56.435 --> 08:59.410
Okay, but just the antipasto.

08:59.411 --> 09:01.202
Bobby could be home
in a couple of minutes

09:01.203 --> 09:03.442
and I want him to
eat the whole meal

09:03.443 --> 09:07.425
with all of us, just like a family.

09:10.834 --> 09:13.768
The iceman cometh. Whoa!

09:17.201 --> 09:20.400
I've been passing
the time, the time...

09:20.401 --> 09:21.840
Somebody pass the grated cheese.

09:21.841 --> 09:24.208
There you go.

09:24.209 --> 09:26.831
I'm here for you...

09:26.832 --> 09:29.199
Go, Bobby! Go, Bobby!

09:29.200 --> 09:34.031
And I've been passing
the time, the time

09:34.032 --> 09:37.966
Living my life

09:37.967 --> 09:40.606
Waiting for you

09:42.127 --> 09:46.829
I've been passing
the time, the time

09:46.830 --> 09:50.540
Living my life

09:50.541 --> 09:53.629
Waiting for you.

09:55.021 --> 09:56.908
Maybe something happened.

09:56.909 --> 09:59.996
Maybe you should go back
to Lenny's and check, Joey.

10:01.389 --> 10:03.363
Hey, Sarah...

10:03.949 --> 10:05.824
nothing happened.

10:07.884 --> 10:10.371
Bobby is just being Bobby.

10:21.195 --> 10:22.954
Mom.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.441
My family... I love them.

10:26.442 --> 10:27.913
They love me.

10:27.914 --> 10:29.577
But I've disappointed 'em

10:29.578 --> 10:31.836
more times than I can remember.

10:36.905 --> 10:38.967
My father...

10:41.897 --> 10:44.602
I know he thinks I'm a fuck-up.

10:47.175 --> 10:50.263
What the fuck. Maybe I am.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.268
Drone!

11:00.423 --> 11:03.226
Drone!

11:04.583 --> 11:09.622
No! Freaking no!

11:14.661 --> 11:18.788
My apartment? In better
shape than I left it.

11:18.789 --> 11:22.139
You know my mother's
responsible for that.

11:31.076 --> 11:33.170
Boxing.

11:39.010 --> 11:41.945
There was a time it
was all I thought about.

11:46.178 --> 11:48.785
But I was too addicted
to the streets...

11:49.250 --> 11:51.825
the high I got from
taking what wasn't mine.

12:06.464 --> 12:09.136
All right, ladies, wrap it up.

12:10.687 --> 12:12.862
Come on. Bang, Bobby, bang.

12:12.863 --> 12:15.350
Baldano, that means you too.

12:15.967 --> 12:17.470
Fucking COs.

12:17.471 --> 12:20.285
Yo, Bobby, You gonna take care

12:20.286 --> 12:22.205
of that thing for me on
the outside like you said?

12:22.206 --> 12:24.094
You're not gonna let
me down, are you, bro?

12:24.095 --> 12:27.628
We've been cellmates
for a long time.

12:28.606 --> 12:30.301
I won't let you down, Angel.

12:30.302 --> 12:32.060
You know how I feel about rats.

12:32.061 --> 12:34.766
Last time I'm gonna say
this... get it moving.

12:36.860 --> 12:39.053
Let's go. Get it moving.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.378
You gonna take care
of that thing for me

12:48.379 --> 12:50.011
on the outside like you said?

12:50.012 --> 12:52.091
You're not gonna let
me down, are you, bro?

12:52.092 --> 12:53.563
Remember your friend Angel?

12:53.564 --> 12:56.465
Your boy you put away?
Well, he says hello.

12:56.987 --> 12:59.418
Revenge is something that can
eat away at you like a cancer...

12:59.419 --> 13:00.761
This way I don't forget you.

13:00.762 --> 13:03.322
Make shit sure not to
forget me, douchebag.

13:03.323 --> 13:04.905
until you get it.

13:06.521 --> 13:08.921
Your revenge.

13:08.922 --> 13:12.457
Then... then you can live.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.143
No.

13:29.144 --> 13:30.295
Gimme that fucking thing.

13:30.296 --> 13:31.447
- That fucking spaz.
- You got it.

13:31.448 --> 13:33.207
- I'm beating myself.
- Unbelievable.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.050
Yeah, I'd like to beat you.

13:35.766 --> 13:38.838
- I got winner.
- Ho! Fucking Bobby.

13:38.839 --> 13:41.366
These were my best
friends, my crew.

13:41.367 --> 13:42.837
Guys I could trust with my life.

13:42.838 --> 13:44.854
Me? Look at you. Lean and mean.

13:44.855 --> 13:46.741
- I can't believe what I'm seeing.
- Come here, Stan.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.596
I figured I'd find
you guys at the park.

13:48.597 --> 13:50.324
You think those bastards
could've put us together?

13:50.325 --> 13:51.765
No, they had to separate us all.

13:51.766 --> 13:53.300
Well, we're all here now.

13:53.301 --> 13:54.516
What really pisses me off

13:54.517 --> 13:56.339
is that prick Johnny
writing a book.

13:56.340 --> 13:58.740
- You read it?
- No.

13:58.741 --> 14:00.852
I look at the cover every day.

14:00.853 --> 14:03.444
I won't open it. I can't
bring myself to read that.

14:03.445 --> 14:05.139
Yeah, well, I read
the fucking thing.

14:05.140 --> 14:07.635
Our names are
splattered all over it.

14:07.636 --> 14:09.459
We should go and do
this motherfucker.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.123
Maybe one day we will.

14:11.124 --> 14:13.043
Now that we were all out,

14:13.044 --> 14:15.121
all we cared about was
starting to earn again

14:15.122 --> 14:17.522
and maybe one day

14:17.523 --> 14:20.806
getting back at the
punks who put us away.

14:24.435 --> 14:27.248
I'm telling you, that's him.

14:27.249 --> 14:29.137
Are you sure? Isn't he still away?

14:29.138 --> 14:31.729
I'm telling you,
that is Bobby Baldano.

14:31.730 --> 14:35.198
- Who's Bobby Baldano?
- Don't worry about it.

14:35.761 --> 14:37.648
Why don't you girls order
us another round of drinks?

14:37.649 --> 14:39.887
We'll be right
back. Come on, Mario.

14:39.888 --> 14:42.049
Let's go say hello.

14:42.801 --> 14:44.079
Hey, man.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.014
You Bobby Baldano, ain't you?

14:48.688 --> 14:50.990
I mean, come on. You're
Bobby, right? You're him?

14:50.991 --> 14:53.166
Hey, Ray, why don't you
do yourself a favor, huh?

14:53.167 --> 14:55.693
Go back to your booth, pay
some attention to your date.

14:55.694 --> 14:57.773
- She's looking a little bored.
- Whoa. All I wanna do

14:57.774 --> 14:59.918
is shake the man's hand,
buy him a drink or something.

14:59.919 --> 15:02.461
Come on, I'm not a fucking
jerk-off here, Lenny.

15:03.151 --> 15:04.845
All you wanna do is shake my hand?

15:04.846 --> 15:06.348
Yeah, man, that's it.

15:06.349 --> 15:08.557
Look, I heard a lot of
good shit about you, man.

15:08.558 --> 15:10.604
- I've been dying to meet you.
- You're Ray, right?

15:10.605 --> 15:11.756
Yeah, man.

15:11.757 --> 15:13.997
Oh, you met him. You happy now?

15:13.998 --> 15:16.684
- Go back to your date.
- Hey, shut up, Lenny.

15:16.685 --> 15:19.292
- Shut up?
- Yeah.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.163
Hey, yo, I read that book...

15:21.164 --> 15:23.468
the one that talks about
you and your friends...

15:23.469 --> 15:24.906
three times.

15:24.907 --> 15:27.114
I read it three fucking times.

15:27.115 --> 15:29.227
Huh? Some crazy shit. You
know what I'm talking...

15:29.228 --> 15:32.395
yo, we got a lot of good
shit going on ourselves.

15:32.396 --> 15:33.978
We're around Slick Sally.

15:35.723 --> 15:37.993
Don't know a Slick Sally.

15:37.994 --> 15:40.682
Well, they used to
call him Fat Sally.

15:40.683 --> 15:42.729
I don't know a Fat Sally.

15:42.730 --> 15:45.882
Come on, man. You know him.

15:46.473 --> 15:48.153
I said I don't know him.

15:49.130 --> 15:50.345
Yo, Fat Sally?

15:50.346 --> 15:52.105
Man, how could you not know...

15:52.106 --> 15:55.111
Oh! Hey, come on! What are you...
come on, Bobby, take it easy.

15:55.112 --> 15:57.320
- What the fuck? What's wrong with you?
- Have a drink.

15:57.321 --> 15:58.888
- Let's all relax.
- Hey, what'd you go and do that f...

15:58.889 --> 16:00.359
wait till Sally
hears about this shit.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.791
I don't give a fuck
what you tell Fat Sally.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.902
I don't care who you're around.

16:04.903 --> 16:06.503
To me you're a dumb
fuck with a big mouth.

16:06.504 --> 16:10.998
Now go back over there before
you have a real problem.

16:15.718 --> 16:18.009
Fucking kids.

16:18.758 --> 16:21.158
Dropping names like
fucking aspirins.

16:21.159 --> 16:23.188
Yeah.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.660
Just one look

16:29.990 --> 16:32.248
That's all it took...

16:33.638 --> 16:35.779
Hey, Patsy.

16:35.780 --> 16:37.220
Oh, ain't this my lucky day?

16:37.221 --> 16:38.819
Look who came to see Patsy.

16:38.820 --> 16:41.283
So you got a few more
under your belt, huh?

16:41.284 --> 16:42.820
Hey, it is what it is.

16:42.821 --> 16:44.740
We all gotta do some
time sooner or later

16:44.741 --> 16:46.946
to keep this thing of ours alive.

16:46.947 --> 16:48.258
Lemme ask you something...

16:48.259 --> 16:50.178
what happened at
Leone's the other night?

16:50.179 --> 16:51.938
Why'd you slap that
kid Ray in the face?

16:51.939 --> 16:53.539
He told you he was
with Slick Sally.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.137
Who the hell is Slick Sally?

16:55.138 --> 16:56.801
Don't play stupid with me, Bobby.

16:56.802 --> 16:59.233
The kid told you he was
talking about Fat Sally.

16:59.234 --> 17:02.305
Fat Sally and Slick
Sally are the same guy.

17:02.306 --> 17:05.536
He had that rubber-band operation
or whatever the fuck you call it

17:05.537 --> 17:07.455
when they try to lose
weight right away.

17:07.457 --> 17:10.272
The point is he
ain't so fat anymore.

17:10.273 --> 17:12.992
I think the kid had a big mouth,
dropping his name like that, Patsy.

17:12.993 --> 17:14.784
Ray is like a kid brother to Sally.

17:14.785 --> 17:17.823
Sally took him under his wing,
just like Tommy did with you.

17:17.824 --> 17:20.415
Sally's a captain now. You'd
better get used to this, Bobby.

17:20.416 --> 17:22.719
- You're kidding me.
- He's Teddy Vesca's son,

17:22.720 --> 17:25.556
and he's in the kitchen, so...

17:26.751 --> 17:28.734
Well, he ain't nothing like
his father. You know that.

17:28.735 --> 17:30.942
You're talking about
a skipper, Bobby.

17:30.943 --> 17:33.055
That's enough. I don't
wanna hear anymore.

17:33.056 --> 17:35.262
And you're gonna
have to report to him.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.629
- He's your captain. That's it.
- All right, Patsy.

17:37.630 --> 17:40.947
- Whatever you say.
- Carmine!

17:45.917 --> 17:47.741
Sally, he wants to see ya.

17:47.742 --> 17:50.877
It's Slick Sally now, Carmine,

17:50.878 --> 17:53.201
not just "Sally."

17:55.612 --> 17:58.830
How many times I gotta
tell these fucking guys?

18:00.092 --> 18:02.300
Don't go nowhere. Watch this sauce.

18:02.301 --> 18:04.145
Sure, no problem.

18:09.851 --> 18:13.418
- What's up, P?
- Sally, have a seat.

18:15.098 --> 18:16.858
Sorry about your boy there.

18:16.859 --> 18:19.545
- Just a little misunderstanding.
- Yeah, right.

18:19.546 --> 18:22.489
So what are we gonna
do about this, Patsy?

18:22.490 --> 18:25.624
Come on. This kid just got outta
the can. He's feeling antsy.

18:25.625 --> 18:28.536
You guys need to
put this behind you.

18:28.537 --> 18:30.217
Let's move on, okay?

18:30.650 --> 18:34.348
All right. Whatever you say, P.

18:38.937 --> 18:41.175
We were gonna go down the
block to get a couple of heroes

18:41.176 --> 18:43.255
from Jon's Deli while
the sauce cooked.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.855
I'm too hungry. I can't wait.

18:44.856 --> 18:47.446
You know what? I'll take
a walk with you, Sally.

18:47.447 --> 18:49.622
Now that's a good idea.

18:49.623 --> 18:51.702
Why don't you do that?
You guys go take a walk.

18:51.703 --> 18:54.135
- But I was gonna drive.
- Drive?

18:54.136 --> 18:55.733
It's a fucking block away.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.414
Walk.

19:00.663 --> 19:03.190
You know, that kid Ray is
like a younger brother to me.

19:03.191 --> 19:05.684
You really embarrassed him, Bobby.

19:05.685 --> 19:08.628
I think he embarrassed himself,
dropping your name like that.

19:08.629 --> 19:10.644
I mean, don't you think
he should've known better

19:10.645 --> 19:13.187
with the feds all over the
place in this neighborhood?

19:14.069 --> 19:16.883
Don't gimme that shit, Bobby, okay?

19:16.884 --> 19:18.451
I know you never liked me.

19:18.452 --> 19:20.243
You're lucky you only smacked him,

19:20.244 --> 19:22.707
because otherwise there would've
been some real consequences.

19:22.708 --> 19:24.531
Really?

19:24.532 --> 19:27.019
Like what kind of consequences?

19:32.211 --> 19:33.970
Let's just go get the heroes.

19:33.971 --> 19:35.697
No, I'd really like
to know what kind

19:35.698 --> 19:38.546
of consequences we're
talking about here, Sally.

19:38.547 --> 19:41.009
Look, I'm a fucking
captain now, Bobby.

19:41.010 --> 19:43.377
Do you know what that means?

19:43.378 --> 19:46.256
Or do I have to
spell it out for you?

19:46.257 --> 19:48.049
Well, I know what it don't mean...

19:48.050 --> 19:51.071
it don't mean shit,
not in this alley.

19:53.969 --> 19:55.728
Did that hurt, Fat Sally?

19:55.729 --> 19:59.907
Oh, I forget... it's
Slick Sally now, right?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.127
Captain?

20:02.128 --> 20:04.878
You may have Patsy fooled,
but I know what you're made of.

20:04.879 --> 20:07.118
If you breathe a
word of this to him,

20:07.119 --> 20:09.646
you're a dead man. Better yet,

20:09.647 --> 20:11.566
I'll tell him you
called Patsy "the pirate"

20:11.567 --> 20:12.718
- behind his back.
- No.

20:12.719 --> 20:13.838
He'd shoot you himself.

20:13.839 --> 20:18.595
No. No, please
don't, Bobby. Please.

20:23.534 --> 20:26.220
- Please.
- You gotta be kidding me.

20:26.221 --> 20:28.763
You believe that shit?

20:29.197 --> 20:30.444
A captain...

20:30.445 --> 20:32.492
a fucking captain

20:32.493 --> 20:34.092
pissing his pants.

20:34.093 --> 20:35.755
Well, I don't know
why things changed,

20:35.756 --> 20:37.419
but here's the real deal

20:37.420 --> 20:40.159
about this overrated
underworld life.

20:42.765 --> 20:44.363
As a federal agent,

20:44.364 --> 20:46.378
I've been watching
the mob since day one,

20:46.379 --> 20:48.042
so I was right in
the heart of things

20:48.043 --> 20:49.770
when Bobby Baldano crossed over.

20:49.771 --> 20:53.503
got straightened
out, got his badge.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.570
He was the youngest
guy to ever get made

20:58.571 --> 20:59.881
in the Carana family.

20:59.882 --> 21:01.354
By his late 20s,

21:01.355 --> 21:03.209
he had established
himself as an earner

21:03.210 --> 21:05.992
and a loyal soldier
amongst a dying breed.

21:05.993 --> 21:07.656
He learned from the best...

21:07.657 --> 21:10.330
and the worst, if
you know what I mean.

21:11.881 --> 21:13.512
Tommy Bono...

21:13.513 --> 21:15.719
he was the underboss of
the family at the time.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.991
He kinda took Bobby under his wing.

21:17.992 --> 21:19.879
Tommy was old school

21:19.880 --> 21:21.735
and all about business.

21:21.736 --> 21:25.030
He was likeable.
People liked Tommy.

21:25.031 --> 21:27.322
Didn't have many enemies.

21:28.615 --> 21:31.997
That was the boss... Vinny Morello.

21:33.575 --> 21:35.365
Vinny was a good guy,

21:35.366 --> 21:37.210
but I can't say the
same for his son.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.933
You all know why you're here.

21:40.934 --> 21:44.698
This is the biggest honor
you can have in this life.

21:45.573 --> 21:48.060
You will now be a part of us.

21:49.350 --> 21:50.917
You all know the rules.

21:50.918 --> 21:54.757
If called upon, you
will drop everything.

21:54.758 --> 21:57.091
We are your family.

21:57.092 --> 21:59.395
We come before anything,

21:59.396 --> 22:01.557
even your own family.

22:21.666 --> 22:26.040
May you burn in hell if you
deceive anyone in this family.

22:27.489 --> 22:29.760
These guys took
themselves very seriously.

22:29.761 --> 22:33.248
or talk about the secrets of
our lives in any shape or form...

22:33.249 --> 22:35.519
And we were very serious
about bringing them down...

22:35.520 --> 22:37.919
my soul will burn in hell.

22:37.920 --> 22:41.237
one way or another.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.903
You're all now a part of us...

22:43.904 --> 22:45.965
la familia.

23:05.469 --> 23:07.357
What I don't get

23:07.358 --> 23:09.308
is there are some guys
who go into this life

23:09.309 --> 23:13.308
knowing if they get
caught they're gonna rat.

23:13.309 --> 23:16.667
They just know it. They're
like, "What the fuck?

23:16.668 --> 23:18.747
Let me do this as long as I can.

23:18.748 --> 23:20.699
If I get caught,

23:20.700 --> 23:23.739
I bring down whoever
I have to to get off."

23:23.740 --> 23:25.562
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's get this over with.

23:25.563 --> 23:27.546
I have a haircut appointment.
I'd really like to make it.

23:27.547 --> 23:28.794
You and your fucking
haircuts, Stan.

23:28.795 --> 23:30.554
You've got a weird-shaped head.

23:30.555 --> 23:32.154
Maybe you should grow your
hair longer to hide that.

23:32.155 --> 23:33.818
Plus, with this shnozole,
maybe longer hair

23:33.819 --> 23:35.577
would make it look
smaller or something.

23:35.578 --> 23:37.625
You're very funny, Jimmy. You
should take that on the road.

23:37.626 --> 23:39.949
Let's do this, Jimmy.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.105
All right, everybody freeze!

23:42.106 --> 23:45.624
You, fill this bag up!
Fill it up! Fill it up!

23:45.625 --> 23:47.544
- On the ground! Pronto!
- Quickly!

23:47.545 --> 23:49.400
Pick up the pace!
Don't touch the alarm!

23:49.401 --> 23:51.352
- Come on, move it!
- Quickly. Let's go. Quickly.

23:51.353 --> 23:53.752
Get the money, let's
go! Get the money!

23:53.753 --> 23:55.255
You too! Quickly. Now!

23:55.256 --> 23:58.391
Quickly! Move! Move your ass!

23:58.392 --> 24:00.983
Don't touch the alarm.
Don't touch the alarm.

24:00.984 --> 24:02.935
All right, we're outta
here. Have a nice day.

24:02.936 --> 24:04.311
That's the way we did things...

24:04.312 --> 24:06.504
one, two, three.

24:07.543 --> 24:09.670
Jobs were like a joke to us.

24:10.519 --> 24:12.974
We actually had fun doing that.

24:14.455 --> 24:16.629
You're like a little
girl. You know that?

24:16.630 --> 24:18.773
What? It's not like they
make 'em easy to open.

24:18.774 --> 24:21.109
Just give me this
fucking thing, will ya?

24:21.110 --> 24:23.829
These guys used to rip 'em
right out of the ground.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.763
But of course, no
one ever saw them...

24:27.669 --> 24:29.556
so they weren't an
easy bunch to nail.

24:29.557 --> 24:31.564
Jackpot.

24:36.916 --> 24:39.379
We made our scores,
kept our mouths shut,

24:39.380 --> 24:40.947
and minded our own business.

24:40.948 --> 24:43.507
We didn't want to draw
attention to ourselves.

24:43.508 --> 24:45.554
We didn't care about
impressing anyone.

24:45.555 --> 24:49.472
On the other hand, not
everyone was like us.

24:58.610 --> 25:01.105
There's Johnny
Morello and his crew.

25:01.106 --> 25:03.537
Hey, girls, if you're good,

25:03.538 --> 25:05.232
I'll take you for
a ride in my Caddy.

25:05.233 --> 25:07.856
That's right. Huh?

25:07.857 --> 25:09.872
That's Mario Bruno,

25:09.873 --> 25:13.157
also known as Mario Casanova.

25:13.681 --> 25:15.087
What, you don't like Caddies?

25:15.088 --> 25:17.487
He thought he was
God's gift to women.

25:17.488 --> 25:18.991
You know what? Go.

25:18.992 --> 25:20.591
But I heard he
couldn't even get it up.

25:20.592 --> 25:22.785
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Fuck you.

25:23.376 --> 25:25.742
Call us when you get a real car.

25:25.743 --> 25:27.694
- Come on.
- Assholes.

25:27.695 --> 25:30.766
What did you do that for,
Mario? Those girls were hot.

25:30.767 --> 25:33.422
And Mikey, a real punk,

25:33.423 --> 25:34.702
a real wannabe.

25:34.703 --> 25:37.581
Ah, they were pigs.
They're all pigs.

25:37.582 --> 25:40.899
Come on, let's go gambling.

25:41.806 --> 25:43.661
Baldano and his crew,

25:43.662 --> 25:45.324
they were low profile...

25:45.325 --> 25:47.788
not the norm at the time.

25:47.789 --> 25:51.212
But you could always find these
guys flaunting their stuff.

25:51.213 --> 25:52.812
I mean look at this,

25:52.813 --> 25:56.171
putting it out there like that?

25:56.172 --> 25:58.571
These guys weren't very bright.

25:58.572 --> 26:00.765
Almost makes you laugh.

26:01.228 --> 26:03.137
How low can you go?

26:31.497 --> 26:33.000
In spite of them,

26:33.001 --> 26:35.015
it was all going well for us.

26:35.016 --> 26:37.223
We had things under control.

26:37.224 --> 26:40.327
We were keeping a safe
distance away from those morons.

26:40.328 --> 26:42.823
- and we were making damn good money.
- Here you go.

26:42.824 --> 26:45.542
We were planning a score that
would hold us over for years.

26:45.543 --> 26:48.422
- No polish on the socks.
- A really big score.

26:48.423 --> 26:50.534
- Give it a good shine there.
- It was gonna be our thing...

26:50.535 --> 26:52.518
- Good, kid.
- Hey, Pete.

26:52.519 --> 26:53.958
- Hey, Bobby.
- ...or so we thought.

26:53.959 --> 26:55.813
- Hey, Tommy.
- Hey.

26:55.814 --> 26:58.757
- You wanted to see me?
- Hey, hello, Bobby. Yeah, I do.

26:58.758 --> 27:01.253
Hold on one second. Hey,
kid, hold on a second.

27:01.254 --> 27:03.941
Hold on. Go get us
a couple of coffees.

27:03.942 --> 27:05.923
- You know how I drink 'em, right?
- Uh-huh.

27:05.924 --> 27:08.195
Here. And buy yourself
a Yoo-hoo or something,

27:08.196 --> 27:10.180
- a soda. I take change.
- Okay.

27:10.181 --> 27:12.537
- And don't forget.
- Okay.

27:15.044 --> 27:16.643
Hey, Bobby,

27:16.644 --> 27:19.331
you've been earning pretty
good out there lately.

27:19.332 --> 27:21.251
I'm very proud of you.

27:21.252 --> 27:24.003
And we all know that you've
got something big planned,

27:24.004 --> 27:27.074
so Vinny would like for you

27:27.075 --> 27:30.594
to bring his son and his
crew with you on this one,

27:30.595 --> 27:33.442
- you know, just for backup.
- Actually, Tommy...

27:33.443 --> 27:34.881
no disrespect to Mr. Morello...

27:34.882 --> 27:36.640
we've pretty much
got things covered.

27:36.641 --> 27:38.834
We don't need any backup.

27:39.362 --> 27:40.769
Extra guys on this job

27:40.770 --> 27:42.241
just make it that much riskier.

27:42.242 --> 27:44.257
Riskier? I'm offering you backup.

27:44.258 --> 27:45.920
It's just that... I mean

27:45.921 --> 27:48.320
you know what you're
dealing with with these guys.

27:48.321 --> 27:51.039
Hey, listen, I know what you're
talking about. They're screw-ups,

27:51.040 --> 27:54.935
but he's the boss's
son. You have no choice.

27:56.799 --> 27:59.487
He should be here any
minute. Put your masks on.

27:59.488 --> 28:01.681
I don't want any
chance of getting made.

28:02.272 --> 28:04.671
Hey, what did I say?
Put your mask on.

28:04.672 --> 28:06.590
- All right.
- Don't fuck this up, huh?

28:06.591 --> 28:08.565
Okay, take it easy.

28:09.119 --> 28:10.963
Here he comes now.

28:24.190 --> 28:25.595
Mr. Klein?

28:25.596 --> 28:28.284
I have a delivery
for an Eleanor Klein.

28:28.285 --> 28:29.564
It's kinda heavy.

28:29.565 --> 28:31.676
Yeah, that's my wife...

28:31.677 --> 28:33.692
always spending.

28:33.693 --> 28:35.355
Can you bring it in here for me?

28:35.356 --> 28:36.955
Yeah, sure, no problem.

28:36.956 --> 28:39.386
Whoa whoa. What's going on?

28:39.387 --> 28:40.602
Stay there!

28:40.603 --> 28:41.883
- Okay. Okay.
- Don't move!

28:41.884 --> 28:43.226
Okay, hotshot, where's the safe?

28:43.227 --> 28:45.485
- Take us to the safe. Let's go.
- The safe.

28:47.867 --> 28:49.593
Let's go, you fuck!

28:49.594 --> 28:51.769
- Okay okay.
- Let's go, let's go.

28:51.770 --> 28:54.522
- Up the stairs. Come on, let's go!
- All right, don't push.

28:54.523 --> 28:56.267
Go on. That's it, go on!

29:09.048 --> 29:12.023
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

29:12.024 --> 29:14.360
What are you talking
about "enjoy," huh?

29:14.361 --> 29:16.439
Hey, don't fuck up.
Don't fuck around.

29:16.440 --> 29:19.690
- Remember what they said.
- Take it easy.

29:20.696 --> 29:22.263
Gotta take the rock, sweetheart,

29:22.264 --> 29:24.719
but I left you the band, okay?

29:25.207 --> 29:27.606
Man, how's a guy like that

29:27.607 --> 29:29.548
get a broad like you?

29:30.166 --> 29:31.798
Oh, lemme guess...

29:31.799 --> 29:33.622
unlimited access

29:33.623 --> 29:36.884
to those shiny little
rocks of his, huh?

29:36.885 --> 29:39.477
I bet you he even paid
for those two beauties.

29:39.478 --> 29:42.005
What are you doing? What are you
doing? I said cut that shit out.

29:42.006 --> 29:45.684
- C'mon! Stop that. Cut that shit out.
- Fuck those guys.

29:45.685 --> 29:50.100
You're real tough with that gun in
your hand and that mask on your face.

29:50.101 --> 29:53.930
Are you so ugly you're
afraid to show your face?

29:55.284 --> 29:57.061
Ugly?

29:58.099 --> 30:00.499
- Me?
- Yeah.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.963
You know what they call me?

30:02.964 --> 30:05.522
They call me Mario Casanova, baby.

30:05.523 --> 30:07.601
What are you doing? What
is the matter with you?

30:07.602 --> 30:09.458
You just told her your name.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.986
Oh shit. I'm sorry, Johnny.

30:11.987 --> 30:15.685
Shit. Now we're fucked.

30:18.002 --> 30:19.472
Sorry, baby. I gotta do this.

30:19.473 --> 30:21.361
- Let's go, let's go!
- The fuck are you doing?!

30:21.362 --> 30:22.960
You heard what he
said... out the door!

30:22.961 --> 30:24.432
- What is this?
- It's her ring.

30:24.433 --> 30:26.256
Gimme this fucking
thing. Come on, get out.

30:26.257 --> 30:29.158
- Don't move!
- Barry!

30:29.680 --> 30:31.906
Barry, come down!

30:32.593 --> 30:36.061
Barry! Barry, I'm...

30:39.056 --> 30:40.911
Wow. Beautiful.

30:40.912 --> 30:44.130
That is a lot of glass.
What do you think, Stan?

30:44.752 --> 30:46.478
These are some serious stones.

30:46.479 --> 30:49.500
My guy's all ready for
'em. You just say the word.

30:52.239 --> 30:54.829
We'll get this sold, have your
money for you within a week.

30:54.830 --> 30:57.819
Beautiful. Great
doing business with ya.

30:59.181 --> 31:01.901
Yeah, for the first and last time.

31:01.902 --> 31:04.013
What? What the hell
you talking about,

31:04.014 --> 31:05.740
"first and last time"? Come on.

31:05.741 --> 31:07.467
- We've got a good thing going on.
- We do.

31:07.468 --> 31:09.595
- You don't wanna ruin it.
- Definitely, Mario.

31:10.893 --> 31:13.772
- Bobby, what the fuck?
- He got what he deserved.

31:13.773 --> 31:15.498
Next time tell him to
leave his dick at home

31:15.499 --> 31:17.451
- before he goes on a job.
- Bobby, you can't be serious.

31:17.452 --> 31:19.819
Are you kidding me? I think you're
a little bit out of line here.

31:19.820 --> 31:22.891
- Out of line?
- Johnny, let it go.

31:22.892 --> 31:25.097
Hey, guys, we made
the score, right?

31:25.098 --> 31:27.946
You guys are gonna get every dime
you got coming to you next week.

31:27.947 --> 31:30.153
Besides, Johnny,
if your father heard

31:30.154 --> 31:32.729
about how this jerk-off
handled himself in there,

31:33.130 --> 31:35.368
he would have his ass.

31:35.369 --> 31:37.288
And probably yours, too,
for bringing him along.

31:37.289 --> 31:39.752
I think that you should probably

31:39.753 --> 31:41.832
just forget about this
little incident and move on.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.688
- I ain't forgetting shit, Jimmy!
- Mario, shut up.

31:43.689 --> 31:46.230
- Shut up! Shut up.
- Fuck you, Bobby!

31:47.369 --> 31:49.832
Bobby, Jimmy, I'll talk
to you guys next week.

31:49.833 --> 31:52.487
That's how you handle
punks like that.

31:52.488 --> 31:54.567
Al, make sure they leave.

31:54.568 --> 31:57.190
Of course we had to
pay tribute to the boss,

31:57.191 --> 31:59.527
- Vinny Morello, and Tommy.
- He had it coming.

31:59.528 --> 32:01.926
Splitting the rest of
take with those assholes

32:01.927 --> 32:03.989
didn't sit too well with us.

32:04.615 --> 32:05.829
Enough time had gone by

32:05.830 --> 32:08.005
for these two morons
to mess up big time.

32:08.006 --> 32:11.389
They were selling cocaine
behind the boss's back.

32:12.071 --> 32:13.574
The best part?

32:13.575 --> 32:16.061
Their biggest customer...

32:16.550 --> 32:18.459
was one of us.

32:19.525 --> 32:21.669
Do you realize you're
looking at 20 years, Bruno?

32:21.670 --> 32:24.453
20 fucking years.

32:24.454 --> 32:27.364
Mario starts crying
when the feds tell him

32:27.365 --> 32:31.260
he's looking at 20. Crying!

32:32.292 --> 32:33.892
It only took this reject

32:33.893 --> 32:35.651
a few minutes to start yapping.

32:35.652 --> 32:37.923
Ah. My favorite.
It gives me energy.

32:37.924 --> 32:40.226
- But once he started...
- So like I was saying...

32:40.227 --> 32:42.234
you couldn't stop him.

32:48.578 --> 32:50.337
- FBI! FBI!
- What the fuck?!

32:50.338 --> 32:52.161
- Freeze!
- Don't even think about it, Johnny.

32:52.162 --> 32:53.921
All right, all right. Don't shoot.

32:53.922 --> 32:58.711
What? What? What do you
guys want from me? Huh?

32:59.169 --> 33:00.929
What do you guys wanna know?

33:00.930 --> 33:03.008
Nabbing those punks helped us

33:03.009 --> 33:04.800
get close to who
we really wanted...

33:04.801 --> 33:06.976
Vinny Morello and Tommy Bono.

33:06.977 --> 33:08.927
What do you guys
want me to do, huh?

33:08.928 --> 33:11.263
Hmm? You want me to
cooperate, I'll cooperate.

33:11.264 --> 33:14.417
Just... you guys gotta
cut me a deal though.

33:15.199 --> 33:17.261
Just cut me a deal.

33:21.055 --> 33:24.446
Paulo, don't take too much
off like you did the last time.

33:24.447 --> 33:26.988
Yeah, a little bit... a
little bit off the back.

33:28.926 --> 33:31.582
They could've threatened
us with the electric chair.

33:31.583 --> 33:33.341
None of us would've flipped.

33:33.342 --> 33:35.677
They were just dying
for one of us to turn

33:35.678 --> 33:38.100
on Vinny Morella and Tommy Bono.

33:38.941 --> 33:41.660
Well, Johnny took care of that.

33:41.661 --> 33:43.668
In the middle too...

33:44.701 --> 33:47.483
If you keep it up now, darling...

33:47.484 --> 33:51.163
It'll be the death of you

33:51.164 --> 33:54.172
You'd better wise up

33:54.173 --> 33:57.357
Listen to your priest

33:58.012 --> 33:59.642
If you don't change...

33:59.643 --> 34:03.592
- Shit.
- Shit.

34:04.636 --> 34:06.842
Just like I said,

34:06.843 --> 34:10.092
there are people who go into
this knowing if they get caught...

34:11.195 --> 34:13.114
they're gonna say
what they gotta say

34:13.114 --> 34:15.320
and sign what they gotta sign

34:15.321 --> 34:18.072
until they cut themselves a deal.

34:18.074 --> 34:21.259
Circle up the wagons

34:21.880 --> 34:25.014
Dark circles under your eyes

34:25.016 --> 34:27.983
The buzzards are circling

34:28.600 --> 34:31.371
Waiting for their prize.

34:44.471 --> 34:46.645
They gave Tommy 18 years.

34:46.646 --> 34:49.717
He died when he was
barely into his sentence.

34:49.717 --> 34:51.476
He got cancer that was treatable.

34:51.478 --> 34:53.846
Nurse. Nurse.

34:53.847 --> 34:56.851
- Just like Tommy said...
- Water.

34:56.853 --> 34:58.837
when you get sick in
prison, you're done.

34:58.838 --> 35:01.365
- Water.
- They made him suffer.

35:01.366 --> 35:04.812
Water. Water.

35:11.956 --> 35:15.603
I'll never be the same again

35:15.604 --> 35:18.706
That's for certain

35:18.707 --> 35:21.490
- Broken up and hollowed out...
- Lenny.

35:21.491 --> 35:24.274
- Yeah?
- Who's that girl?

35:24.275 --> 35:27.722
Oh, her name is Rena.
She's a neighborhood girl.

35:30.323 --> 35:33.105
She was here the night
you smacked that punk Ray.

35:33.106 --> 35:35.792
So what did you tell her about me?

35:35.793 --> 35:37.767
Nothing. What was I gonna tell her?

35:38.962 --> 35:40.369
She's pretty hot.

35:40.370 --> 35:41.872
Nah, she's not pretty hot.

35:41.873 --> 35:44.144
She's smoking hot.

35:44.145 --> 35:45.903
Send over a drink.

35:45.904 --> 35:47.966
All right.

35:49.680 --> 35:53.360
The gentleman would like to buy
you two lovely ladies a drink.

35:53.361 --> 35:54.863
Thanks, Lenny.

35:54.864 --> 35:56.990
You got it, Rena.

35:58.512 --> 36:01.119
Do your thing, Casanova.

36:01.711 --> 36:03.685
Come on, chop chop.

36:05.262 --> 36:06.605
He's coming over.

36:06.606 --> 36:09.028
I think I'm gonna go
to the ladies room.

36:13.486 --> 36:17.516
- Thanks for the drink.
- Hey, no problem.

36:17.517 --> 36:20.044
- So what's your name?
- Come on.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.549
You already know my name.

36:21.550 --> 36:24.364
What, did Lenny rat me out?

36:24.365 --> 36:27.883
- So you know my name too?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

36:27.884 --> 36:31.596
- Rena. It's a real nice name.
- Thanks.

36:31.597 --> 36:33.643
You know, last time I was here,

36:33.644 --> 36:35.803
I saw you smack Ray.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.665
- He was pretty embarrassed.
- Well, he deserved it.

36:41.675 --> 36:43.178
What are you, some
kind of tough guy?

36:43.179 --> 36:45.501
Come on, cut it out.

36:46.699 --> 36:50.081
- You like cars?
- Cars?

36:54.762 --> 36:58.056
Still blue water

36:58.057 --> 37:01.416
Still blue water

37:01.417 --> 37:04.585
Roll over me, over me

37:04.586 --> 37:07.943
Still blue water

37:07.944 --> 37:09.544
Still blue water...

37:09.545 --> 37:12.862
Hey, mister, peel out!

37:16.264 --> 37:18.293
Wow!

37:21.639 --> 37:23.654
Give us a little more
time and I just might

37:23.655 --> 37:25.733
be willing to help you
break that dry streak.

37:25.734 --> 37:29.269
Trust me, it'll be worth the wait.

37:53.380 --> 37:55.572
I can't take it.

38:05.506 --> 38:07.513
Prison.

38:09.090 --> 38:11.393
These guys go in dysfunctional

38:11.394 --> 38:13.936
and they come out worse.

38:28.992 --> 38:32.691
Joey, how long I know you?

38:33.184 --> 38:35.212
All my life, right?

38:36.767 --> 38:39.156
So I'm gonna be honest with you.

38:40.671 --> 38:43.742
What are you gonna do
about your son Bobby?

38:43.743 --> 38:45.565
Always getting in trouble.

38:45.566 --> 38:49.428
How many times you gonna stick
your neck out for this kid, huh?

38:53.502 --> 38:55.548
You built a name up for yourself.

38:55.549 --> 38:57.405
You got yourself an empire

38:57.406 --> 38:59.893
and he's gonna fuck it up big time.

39:01.341 --> 39:04.363
He goes back, they're
gonna throw away the keys.

39:05.820 --> 39:08.176
I'm glad I'm not in your shoes...

39:08.860 --> 39:11.291
kid like that.

39:11.292 --> 39:13.980
All I'm saying, Joey, if
he's gonna listen to anybody,

39:13.981 --> 39:15.954
he's gonna listen to you.

39:16.987 --> 39:18.779
You hear me? You're the only one

39:18.780 --> 39:20.721
he's gonna listen to.

39:22.139 --> 39:25.529
No, but my love is singing.
It's what I wanna do.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.889
Unfortunately, I do work as
a cocktail waitress for now.

39:28.890 --> 39:31.321
But singing is what I wanna do.

39:31.322 --> 39:32.921
I never met a chick
who sang before.

39:32.922 --> 39:35.640
- Chick?
- Well...

39:35.641 --> 39:37.452
you know what I mean.

39:38.617 --> 39:41.080
But since you asked,
I've been singing

39:41.081 --> 39:43.503
since I was a kid.
I studied for years.

39:45.016 --> 39:49.096
What about you?
What were you in for?

39:50.168 --> 39:51.978
What are you gonna do now?

39:52.408 --> 39:54.934
I heard your father's
a construction bigwig.

39:54.935 --> 39:56.997
You gonna go work for him?

40:06.678 --> 40:09.493
I'm telling you I've been
watching the guy all morning.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.413
It's like he don't even care.

40:11.414 --> 40:13.077
The fucking balls on this guy.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.092
Well, if I gotta come down there

40:15.093 --> 40:16.756
and make my presence known,
that's what I'm gonna do.

40:16.757 --> 40:18.612
Glenn, I'm not paying $55 an hour

40:18.613 --> 40:21.930
so this clown can go sell
high school students drugs!

40:27.316 --> 40:29.843
Hey, how long we known
each other, Glenn?

40:29.844 --> 40:32.811
No, 34 years to be exact.

40:33.524 --> 40:35.122
Why is it... isn't it redundant

40:35.123 --> 40:36.978
I have to send three
required letters

40:36.979 --> 40:38.482
to your union now? That's right!

40:38.483 --> 40:40.274
High school students,
that's correct.

40:40.275 --> 40:41.714
I wanna tell you something.

40:41.715 --> 40:44.402
If he's not off my site
by 6:00 Monday morning,

40:44.403 --> 40:46.193
put on a nice suit.

40:46.194 --> 40:49.576
'Cause you're gonna be on
the 6:00 news Monday night.

41:02.641 --> 41:04.898
Hi honey.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.291
Hi.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.767
What's wrong, Joseph?

41:14.256 --> 41:18.467
10:00. You haven't
even had any dinner.

41:19.439 --> 41:21.283
I brought you some.

41:24.271 --> 41:26.725
I'm not even hungry.

41:31.214 --> 41:33.165
What is it, Joseph?

41:33.166 --> 41:35.620
You haven't been yourself.

41:39.533 --> 41:41.410
Well, it's Bobby.

41:42.509 --> 41:44.996
I know what you want for him.

41:45.772 --> 41:48.491
I know what I want for him.

41:48.492 --> 41:52.125
But I just can't figure out
what Bobby wants for himself.

41:59.531 --> 42:01.866
Now that's the only way
to erect a crane, Danny.

42:01.867 --> 42:04.409
Just know it's appreciated.

42:06.506 --> 42:08.009
- Bobby, how you doing?
- Hey, guys.

42:08.010 --> 42:09.449
Hey, Bobby, welcome home.

42:09.450 --> 42:11.359
How's it going?

42:13.834 --> 42:16.637
Hey, Bobby.

42:18.089 --> 42:19.720
You decide to take the plunge?

42:19.721 --> 42:22.312
- What plunge?
- Come on.

42:22.313 --> 42:23.752
Play stupid with me.

42:23.753 --> 42:25.945
You know what I'm talking about.

42:26.824 --> 42:29.031
You should be at work
here with me right now.

42:29.032 --> 42:31.591
Come on. I'll
sponsor you right now.

42:31.592 --> 42:33.543
I'll get your book.

42:33.544 --> 42:36.422
Be a shop steward, project
manager, super... whatever you wish.

42:36.423 --> 42:38.502
Better yet, work by my side

42:38.503 --> 42:41.542
- at the company, from the office.
- I don't know, Dad.

42:41.543 --> 42:42.886
Why not?

42:42.887 --> 42:44.869
I've got some other
things in the works.

42:44.870 --> 42:48.252
- You know I like to do my own thing.
- Your own thing, huh?

42:52.006 --> 42:54.100
You back in touch with Perotti?

42:55.045 --> 42:57.188
- What are you talking about?
- Maybe you should speak

42:57.189 --> 42:59.204
to the people that own
your own thing, Bobby.

42:59.205 --> 43:01.540
Tell 'em to give it back to
you, you know, free and clear.

43:01.541 --> 43:04.279
Pop, what are you talking about?

43:07.204 --> 43:09.691
Would you consider my offer?

43:12.516 --> 43:14.882
- Would you give me that?
- Yeah yeah.

43:14.883 --> 43:18.082
I'll think about it. I really will.

43:18.083 --> 43:20.322
Listen, I'm gonna get going.

43:20.323 --> 43:21.986
I just stopped by to say hello.

43:21.987 --> 43:23.864
Oh.

43:26.242 --> 43:28.565
You'd better get
it right this time.

43:30.402 --> 43:32.409
Straighten out your act.

43:33.026 --> 43:35.054
All right, Pop.

44:18.941 --> 44:21.916
The evidence at hand

44:21.917 --> 44:24.904
To know they're not my shoes

44:25.851 --> 44:27.835
She said, "If there's..."

44:27.836 --> 44:30.715
Wait wait, you said you
wanted to hear me sing, right?

44:30.716 --> 44:34.555
The evidence at hand...

44:34.556 --> 44:37.146
I spent every penny
I saved making it.

44:37.147 --> 44:39.023
It's my demo.

44:39.611 --> 44:40.986
This is the song I want to make

44:40.987 --> 44:43.180
a music video out of one day.

44:44.571 --> 44:47.928
I play the fool

44:47.929 --> 44:51.344
I sold myself...

44:52.122 --> 44:54.097
So what do you think?

44:54.873 --> 44:57.112
Do you think you can handle me?

44:57.113 --> 44:57.613
Come on

45:02.137 --> 45:06.422
I know you can't resist my touch

45:06.423 --> 45:09.975
Feels like much too much

45:09.976 --> 45:10.476
Come on

45:14.903 --> 45:19.382
Baby, baby, let's not fight

45:19.383 --> 45:23.114
Let's make love tonight

45:23.863 --> 45:27.125
You can't fight it

45:27.126 --> 45:30.613
No escape

45:30.614 --> 45:35.370
Feel the touch of my skin

45:36.532 --> 45:39.763
You can't hide it

45:39.764 --> 45:42.899
It's too late

45:42.900 --> 45:48.499
You know you want to give in

45:48.500 --> 45:54.769
I can feel you want me so

45:54.770 --> 45:57.842
Close your eyes

45:57.843 --> 46:01.522
And just let go

46:01.523 --> 46:04.210
Come on...

46:04.211 --> 46:05.840
Come back around, I know you can...

46:05.841 --> 46:07.569
Come back around, I know you can...

46:07.570 --> 46:09.201
Rena was a distraction,

46:09.202 --> 46:10.449
but a good one.

46:10.450 --> 46:12.337
What really mattered though

46:12.338 --> 46:15.425
was making room
for my crew again...

46:17.265 --> 46:19.653
which meant cleaning up this mess.

46:20.080 --> 46:22.959
Patsy, we gotta do
something about this guy.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.775
He's out there planning jobs
without even contacting me.

46:25.776 --> 46:28.303
He hasn't reported to me
once since he come out.

46:28.304 --> 46:30.927
I mean, did you tell him
I was gonna be his captain?

46:30.928 --> 46:32.462
Sally, Sally, I told him.

46:32.463 --> 46:33.774
And then he goes and steals

46:33.775 --> 46:35.534
Ray's girlfriend from him.

46:35.535 --> 46:38.702
First he goes and smacks
him and makes a fool of him,

46:38.703 --> 46:41.965
and then he goes and picks
the girl up in the same place.

46:41.966 --> 46:44.302
I mean, that's not right, Patsy.

46:44.303 --> 46:46.797
Sally, that's enough, okay?
The kid's just trying to earn

46:46.798 --> 46:49.132
just to get back
into my good graces.

46:49.133 --> 46:52.141
And do you really think I give
a fuck about Ray's girlfriend?

46:52.142 --> 46:53.741
He's embarrassed.

46:53.742 --> 46:55.436
He's not even showing
his face around.

46:55.437 --> 46:56.876
You know, I think they
wrapped that rubber band

46:56.877 --> 46:58.412
around your balls
instead of your stomach.

46:58.413 --> 47:01.836
And they must've wrapped it too tight,
because you ain't thinking right.

47:01.837 --> 47:05.035
This kid could be a real loose
cannon if you provoke him, Sally.

47:05.036 --> 47:07.018
I'm telling you now... just relax.

47:07.019 --> 47:08.811
Don't go talking
about him to anybody,

47:08.812 --> 47:11.299
because he'll find out
then you got problems.

47:13.676 --> 47:15.498
All right, listen to me.

47:15.499 --> 47:19.165
Sally, you can't provoke him.

47:37.383 --> 47:40.166
Sally, what's that noise?

47:40.167 --> 47:42.471
Can you hear me? Sally?

47:42.472 --> 47:46.038
What the fuck is going
on over there? Answer me!

47:46.439 --> 47:48.468
Yo, Sally!

48:01.958 --> 48:03.685
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

48:03.686 --> 48:05.827
- Well, what time?
- Before 3:00.

48:05.828 --> 48:08.068
You believe this
shit? Now of all times.

48:08.069 --> 48:10.564
I mean, this family can't
seem to solve its differences.

48:10.565 --> 48:13.060
It's gotta be that
crew from downtown.

48:13.061 --> 48:14.883
With due respect, Patsy,

48:14.884 --> 48:17.315
Fat Sally... he's dead weight.

48:17.316 --> 48:19.427
They were probably
trying to do you a favor.

48:19.428 --> 48:21.442
Ooh. That's your skipper
you're talking about.

48:21.443 --> 48:23.554
You know, the skipper you
never reported to once.

48:23.555 --> 48:25.281
And he ain't too
fucking happy about that.

48:25.282 --> 48:28.322
I'm not reporting to nobody.
I'm through with this.

48:28.323 --> 48:30.914
- I'm done.
- You're through with this?

48:30.915 --> 48:33.698
I'll tell you when
you're through with this.

48:33.699 --> 48:35.713
What, do you think you're
gonna go out there on your own?

48:35.714 --> 48:38.401
That's not gonna happen.
You belong over here.

48:38.402 --> 48:40.736
This family needs you now.

48:40.737 --> 48:43.201
There's too many people
in this family right now

48:43.202 --> 48:45.120
that I don't know, I don't trust.

48:45.121 --> 48:47.744
Ain't making the same
mistakes I made in the past.

48:47.745 --> 48:49.983
Oh. Who don't you trust?

48:49.984 --> 48:52.415
And what makes you
think we trust you?

48:52.416 --> 48:54.974
Trust me? You've gotta be
fucking kidding me, Stevie.

48:54.975 --> 48:56.958
Okay okay, knock it off.

48:56.959 --> 48:59.871
You know, you're putting me
in a very bad spot over here,

48:59.872 --> 49:03.039
one that I know you ain't
gonna be too happy with.

49:03.040 --> 49:06.174
I know that, Patsy. I know
you gotta do what you gotta do.

49:06.175 --> 49:09.054
You're telling me I
gotta do what I gotta do?

49:09.055 --> 49:12.022
Is that what you say to me?

49:51.195 --> 49:52.777
Bobby.

49:54.809 --> 49:57.068
What are you doing here?

50:04.985 --> 50:08.400
Come on, Baldano.
That's all you got?

50:09.848 --> 50:12.303
Fuck you, Bobby.

50:28.215 --> 50:30.854
Really?

50:57.843 --> 50:59.490
Wow.

50:59.892 --> 51:01.921
Patsy Perotti.

51:03.284 --> 51:05.106
What can I do for you today

51:05.107 --> 51:07.730
that you haven't
already have done for me?

51:07.731 --> 51:10.962
Or should I say, to me?

51:10.963 --> 51:14.065
What's that supposed
to mean, Baldano?

51:14.066 --> 51:18.211
Well, for starters, what do you say
making this goon of yours wait outside?

51:25.969 --> 51:28.740
Tell me I'm hearing
things, tell me I'm wrong.

51:30.161 --> 51:32.719
I can't tell you that
you're wrong, Patsy,

51:32.720 --> 51:34.945
because it's true.

51:35.855 --> 51:38.222
If you were half the man
you claim to be around here,

51:38.223 --> 51:40.142
you'd pull him off
the job yourself.

51:40.143 --> 51:42.414
He's selling drugs,
all right? To kids.

51:42.415 --> 51:46.462
Teenagers at a
Catholic high school.

51:47.662 --> 51:49.325
Oh, you don't know this?

51:49.326 --> 51:51.213
It's none of your fucking business

51:51.214 --> 51:52.877
what I know and what I don't know.

51:52.878 --> 51:55.021
But what I do know, if you
know what's good for you,

51:55.022 --> 51:56.876
is you're gonna pick
up the phone right now

51:56.877 --> 51:59.596
in front of me and
call the union local

51:59.597 --> 52:01.604
and tell 'em you made a mistake.

52:02.381 --> 52:05.451
Well, I know I'm not
supposed to say this

52:05.452 --> 52:06.763
to a man like you, Patsy,

52:06.764 --> 52:10.364
but... over my dead body.

52:11.245 --> 52:13.579
It's a disgrace,

52:13.580 --> 52:16.219
what your kind have become.

52:16.779 --> 52:18.602
You know that?

52:18.603 --> 52:21.178
It's a fucking disgrace.

52:22.764 --> 52:25.513
If that's how you want it,
Baldano, that's how it'll be.

52:25.514 --> 52:28.010
But for a smart guy who
put all this together

52:28.011 --> 52:30.857
without asking for
help from guys like me,

52:30.858 --> 52:33.695
you're pretty fucking stupid.

52:49.833 --> 52:52.935
What? He what?

52:52.936 --> 52:54.811
Shit.

53:10.374 --> 53:12.054
Okay.

53:12.871 --> 53:15.268
He was talking about breaking
ground in eight months.

53:15.269 --> 53:18.052
- It takes 16 months to get the permits.
- Dad, can we talk?

53:18.053 --> 53:20.292
Yeah, your brother and
I are talking right now.

53:20.293 --> 53:23.012
- Sit down.
- Alone, Dad.

53:23.013 --> 53:25.368
I need to talk to you alone.

53:26.436 --> 53:28.067
Where are you going? Sit down.

53:28.068 --> 53:30.308
Hey, I don't want
secrets in this family.

53:30.309 --> 53:33.028
- You're brothers.
- I don't wanna hear what he has to say.

53:33.029 --> 53:35.897
I'm sick of the drama.

53:37.124 --> 53:39.993
I got work to do, Pop.
I'm going back to the office.

53:44.963 --> 53:46.689
What are you, a walking tornado?

53:46.690 --> 53:49.665
What's with you? Can
there be any peace

53:49.666 --> 53:51.682
- when you're around?
- Peace?

53:51.683 --> 53:54.369
After you just butted heads with
Pasquale Perotti of all people?

53:54.370 --> 53:56.384
What do you know about my
business with Patsy Perotti?

53:56.385 --> 53:58.304
Come on, Dad. You
should know better.

53:58.305 --> 54:01.504
Shit like that don't stay a
secret for a New York minute.

54:01.505 --> 54:03.763
I should know what?

54:04.704 --> 54:07.167
Know what? That the
man's a piece of shit?

54:07.168 --> 54:09.343
Everything he stands
for belongs in hell?

54:09.344 --> 54:11.232
I give you every opportunity
to come work with me

54:11.233 --> 54:13.311
and this family and
you choose him instead.

54:13.312 --> 54:15.390
I don't choose him, Dad.

54:15.391 --> 54:17.566
- It's not like that.
- No, it is like that.

54:17.567 --> 54:19.326
It is like that.
You choose that life.

54:19.327 --> 54:20.606
That life.

54:20.607 --> 54:22.751
That's the life you choose.

54:22.752 --> 54:27.726
You know, every day
I pray in my own way.

54:29.662 --> 54:32.925
And I pray every fucking day
you don't end up like that.

54:32.926 --> 54:35.347
Man, not like him.

54:36.798 --> 54:38.325
I don't know.

54:39.005 --> 54:40.860
The more I see of you, Bobby,

54:40.861 --> 54:43.795
the less I feel my prayers
are getting answered here.

54:44.478 --> 54:45.915
You're committing suicide

54:45.916 --> 54:47.387
and you don't even know it.

54:47.388 --> 54:51.087
Your damn pride gets in
the way of everything.

54:52.220 --> 54:54.478
You can't help me...

54:55.067 --> 54:57.161
and I can't help you.

55:04.603 --> 55:07.833
Jimmy, it can't wait. Call Stan.

55:07.834 --> 55:10.256
It's gotta happen today, now.

55:10.747 --> 55:13.113
Just because I was in
the can for a while,

55:13.114 --> 55:14.937
don't mean I lost
my touch around here.

55:14.938 --> 55:17.752
I heard your name in the
can was "In the Can Stan."

55:17.753 --> 55:19.335
Yeah, in the can.

55:21.273 --> 55:24.872
Tommy used to warn me about him
without coming right out and saying it.

55:26.072 --> 55:28.343
Take a guy like Chip
over there. Look at him...

55:28.344 --> 55:31.256
young, handsome. You gotta stop
dressing like a fucking hillbilly.

55:31.257 --> 55:33.271
Where do you get
this shit from, Stan?

55:33.272 --> 55:36.919
Listen to me, Jimmy, my
father... my father's at risk.

55:36.920 --> 55:38.796
Just meet us!

55:41.112 --> 55:43.862
Here you go, P. Use this one.

55:43.863 --> 55:46.101
I can't believe you're
coming with us, P.

55:46.102 --> 55:48.117
Why don't you just
let us handle it?

55:48.118 --> 55:50.197
Jerry, when you get to my
position, you're supposed to get

55:50.198 --> 55:52.597
guys like you that you could
trust to handle all your work.

55:52.598 --> 55:55.019
But that's how you get soft.

55:55.637 --> 55:56.948
I got to where I am

55:56.949 --> 55:59.436
because I always
handle my own work.

56:00.149 --> 56:01.862
That's just how it is.

56:06.708 --> 56:08.915
You guys handle Bobby and his crew.

56:08.916 --> 56:10.612
His father's mine.

56:10.613 --> 56:12.307
Look at all the paint on 'em.

56:12.308 --> 56:14.729
Do you paint houses or
do you paint each other?

56:15.283 --> 56:16.754
Done fixing yourself
up, pretty boy?

56:16.755 --> 56:19.251
- 'Cause we got work to do.
- He's just gotta do my side...

56:19.252 --> 56:21.477
- No, you're done.
- Come on, let's go.

56:32.818 --> 56:34.896
Five years.

56:34.897 --> 56:38.846
Five years I did on the inside
for this so-called family.

56:39.953 --> 56:42.277
And this is what it comes down to.

56:53.296 --> 56:54.823
Let's go.

56:58.512 --> 57:01.446
Underneath the seats.
They're already loaded.

57:02.511 --> 57:04.191
Let's do it.

57:18.861 --> 57:20.844
Step on it, Al.

57:20.845 --> 57:22.754
Come on, Al! Go!

57:29.932 --> 57:31.776
Holy shit.

57:39.979 --> 57:41.162
Yo, Bobby.

57:41.163 --> 57:43.370
Unscheduled
extermination today, bro.

57:43.371 --> 57:45.289
Yeah, this place is
crawling with bugs.

57:45.290 --> 57:47.177
Yeah, let's just
meet at Jon's Deli.

57:47.178 --> 57:49.982
- Got it.
- All right.

57:51.402 --> 57:52.681
86 it, Al.

57:52.682 --> 57:55.255
It's good news.

58:05.608 --> 58:09.469
Here. There's your sandwich.

58:17.063 --> 58:19.462
After Sally lucking
out once already

58:19.463 --> 58:22.342
in front of that bistro and
now with Patsy getting pinched,

58:22.343 --> 58:25.125
- he just couldn't handle the pressure.
- Go ahead.

58:25.126 --> 58:27.781
So of course, what's he do?

58:27.782 --> 58:30.853
He brings down whoever he has
to to save his own fat ass,

58:30.854 --> 58:32.453
just like I thought he would.

58:32.454 --> 58:36.217
All right, what do you wanna know?

58:38.917 --> 58:40.740
But for some reason,

58:40.741 --> 58:43.460
Sally Vesca didn't give
up Baldano and his crew.

58:43.461 --> 58:46.019
And for whatever reason,
these guys were confident

58:46.020 --> 58:49.687
he'd keep his mouth
shut, at least about them.

58:52.132 --> 58:54.275
Fat Sally feared this crew,

58:54.276 --> 58:56.322
whether they were
on the inside or out.

58:56.323 --> 58:59.234
And they knew it, so they
went about business as usual.

58:59.235 --> 59:02.754
We still could've brought them
in on suspicion or association,

59:02.755 --> 59:05.281
but we were waiting for
them to get comfortable.

59:05.282 --> 59:07.041
Too comfortable.

59:07.042 --> 59:09.441
Comfortable enough to
lead us even further

59:09.442 --> 59:11.504
into their little world.

59:26.816 --> 59:28.959
I can't believe this shit.

59:28.960 --> 59:32.375
Fucking Patsy's never gonna know
how close we came to taking him out.

59:32.768 --> 59:35.358
You were right. You were
right about this Fat Sally.

59:35.359 --> 59:38.334
- I gotta give you that.
- You guys hear about Andre Swann?

59:38.335 --> 59:40.094
Andre Swann? What, is that

59:40.095 --> 59:42.654
that kid that used to work
for Tyler Moss back in the day?

59:42.655 --> 59:45.629
- Who's Tyler Moss?
- That dude who runs Coney Island.

59:45.630 --> 59:48.317
Andre Swann was
one of his top dogs.

59:48.318 --> 59:50.845
Anyway, he wound
up getting pinched.

59:50.846 --> 59:54.525
He rolled on Tyler, wound up
doing a bit similar to ours.

59:54.526 --> 59:58.908
Swannie wound up in
Alabama with the WPP.

59:58.909 --> 01:00:01.404
Wait, if he's in the
witness protection program,

01:00:01.405 --> 01:00:03.324
- how'd you know he's in Alabama?
- Yeah.

01:00:03.325 --> 01:00:05.467
'Cause the cops
found him in a swamp

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:08.621
with a bullet hole in the back
of his head and get this...

01:00:09.884 --> 01:00:12.091
a rat stuffed in his mouth.

01:00:12.092 --> 01:00:14.107
And you think it was Tyler Moss?

01:00:14.108 --> 01:00:16.570
What do you think? The
feds questioned him,

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:18.266
no evidence.

01:00:18.267 --> 01:00:20.345
You and me, we're gonna
go see Tyler today.

01:00:20.346 --> 01:00:22.202
I already have it set up.

01:00:22.203 --> 01:00:23.833
He had to find out somehow.

01:00:23.834 --> 01:00:27.663
Maybe he can help us find
out what we need to know.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.633
Yeah.

01:00:32.026 --> 01:00:33.705
Uh-huh.

01:00:34.554 --> 01:00:36.527
That's right.

01:00:37.465 --> 01:00:39.992
- Show time.
- Here he is.

01:00:39.993 --> 01:00:42.328
Here's what you get,
that's the code of respect

01:00:42.329 --> 01:00:44.600
Don't try to... what
do you want from me?

01:00:44.601 --> 01:00:47.511
Try to cross me,
I best to put you in check

01:00:47.512 --> 01:00:49.879
What do you need from me?

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.087
Don't neglect, four
or five put you...

01:00:52.088 --> 01:00:54.423
World-famous Coney Island.

01:00:54.424 --> 01:00:56.086
Believe they wanna
do away with all this?

01:00:56.087 --> 01:00:59.766
Asshole developers. Tear
it down, build it up.

01:00:59.767 --> 01:01:01.877
They wanna knock down the rides.

01:01:01.878 --> 01:01:03.606
They even wanna build casinos here,

01:01:03.607 --> 01:01:06.389
wanna turn this into a
dump like Atlantic City.

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:08.596
Coney is Brooklyn.

01:01:08.597 --> 01:01:11.020
Coney defines Brooklyn.

01:01:11.958 --> 01:01:14.069
Shit pisses me off.

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.204
Yeah. Well, I know you didn't
come here to hear me reminisce

01:01:17.205 --> 01:01:18.803
about Coney. Why are we here?

01:01:18.804 --> 01:01:21.543
The shit we heard about Andre.

01:01:24.405 --> 01:01:26.019
Yeah? What about it?

01:01:26.644 --> 01:01:28.402
It's a damn shame.

01:01:28.403 --> 01:01:31.443
Good old nigga like that
found dead in the swamp.

01:01:31.444 --> 01:01:33.363
It's fucked up.

01:01:33.364 --> 01:01:35.346
I agree. I do.

01:01:35.347 --> 01:01:37.938
Be really fucked up if
someone like Johnny Morello

01:01:37.939 --> 01:01:40.873
and his douchebag friends
wound up the same way.

01:01:42.259 --> 01:01:45.201
Uh. I get where you're coming from.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.640
Well, I can't help you.

01:01:46.641 --> 01:01:49.314
For some reason, I think you can.

01:01:50.002 --> 01:01:51.825
Well, even if I could, why would I?

01:01:51.826 --> 01:01:53.393
I don't know. Maybe you forgot

01:01:53.394 --> 01:01:55.216
about the favor
Tommy Bono did for ya

01:01:55.217 --> 01:01:57.857
when you had your beef
with Richie Caiola.

01:01:58.801 --> 01:02:00.272
Remember that?

01:02:00.273 --> 01:02:03.426
Oh, y'all know
about that shit, huh?

01:02:04.944 --> 01:02:07.535
Well, maybe, just
maybe, I can help you.

01:02:07.536 --> 01:02:09.135
But you gotta do
something for me first.

01:02:09.136 --> 01:02:10.799
And what's that?

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.025
Go talk to my cousin Will.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.704
Go talk to him. He'll
tell you what's up.

01:02:22.223 --> 01:02:24.877
I'm on top of the world,
I'm on top of the world

01:02:24.878 --> 01:02:27.149
I'm on top of the
world, motherfucker, yeah

01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:29.997
Yeah, for crying
out loud, oh mercy me

01:02:29.998 --> 01:02:32.621
How come these songs
on the radio so nursery?

01:02:32.622 --> 01:02:34.573
- Is about to bring out...
- Hey, Willie.

01:02:34.574 --> 01:02:37.132
What's up with this kid's lyrics?

01:02:37.133 --> 01:02:39.308
It's like he's making
up shit as he goes along.

01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:41.099
"Motherfucker this
and motherfucker that."

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.700
I thought you was trying
to clean his image up.

01:02:42.701 --> 01:02:44.811
Trying, man. You
know these dudes, man.

01:02:44.812 --> 01:02:46.571
- Damn.
- But you're not feeling it?

01:02:46.572 --> 01:02:48.587
Check it out,
I'm on top of the world

01:02:48.588 --> 01:02:51.019
I'm on top of the world,
I'm on top of the world

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.419
Motherfucker, yeah,
I'm on top of the world

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.138
I'm on top of the world,
I'm on top of the world

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:58.025
- Motherfucker, yeah...
- Willie.

01:02:58.026 --> 01:03:00.714
Some guy named Bobby
Baldano is here to see you.

01:03:00.715 --> 01:03:03.658
- Motherfucker, yeah...
- Send him in.

01:03:03.659 --> 01:03:06.145
Hey yo, Joey, gimme five.

01:03:06.954 --> 01:03:08.425
Yo, the shit sounding good, baby.

01:03:08.426 --> 01:03:11.208
Keep it just like that.
Stay in pocket with it.

01:03:11.209 --> 01:03:13.896
Yeah, I know, I know.
What you expect?

01:03:13.897 --> 01:03:15.496
I'm Joey "The Kid," motherfucker.

01:03:15.497 --> 01:03:17.704
I ain't no bullshit-ass rapper.

01:03:17.705 --> 01:03:20.328
The real deal. Come on, Willie.

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:23.896
I'm gonna make you rich,
man. I'mma make you rich.

01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:36.325
What you looking at, motherfucker?

01:03:36.326 --> 01:03:38.310
Oh, nothing. I'm just...

01:03:38.311 --> 01:03:39.846
- a big fan.
- Hold on.

01:03:39.847 --> 01:03:41.350
Hold on, he can't hear
you. Talk through here.

01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:42.406
Talk now. Go ahead.

01:03:42.407 --> 01:03:44.582
Oh, I'm a big fan.

01:03:44.583 --> 01:03:47.670
- I love your music.
- Of course you do.

01:03:50.182 --> 01:03:51.973
I can't believe you
got Joey "The Kid" here.

01:03:51.974 --> 01:03:53.381
He's gonna be huge.

01:03:53.382 --> 01:03:55.619
I hope so. I got a
lot riding on him.

01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:59.203
Hopefully he can stay out of
trouble, keep his nose clean.

01:03:59.204 --> 01:04:01.379
Oh yeah, I've been reading
a lot of shit about him.

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:03.492
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
believe everything you read.

01:04:03.493 --> 01:04:06.530
I mean, Joey needs to
discipline himself a little more,

01:04:06.531 --> 01:04:08.450
stay clear of some
of these assholes

01:04:08.451 --> 01:04:10.370
trying to ride his
coattails, you know?

01:04:10.371 --> 01:04:12.931
I need to protect him
from all that bullshit.

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:15.458
That's why my cousin
called you two.

01:04:15.459 --> 01:04:19.330
When I picked him up off the
streets and got him back in the game,

01:04:19.331 --> 01:04:22.145
he was running around
with a bunch of lowlifes,

01:04:22.146 --> 01:04:26.226
doing all kind of stupid shit
to make ends meet, you know?

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:31.521
Anyway, he got in pretty
deep with these guys.

01:04:31.522 --> 01:04:34.031
Now they won't leave him alone.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.567
We've had a few altercations
with these scumbags.

01:04:41.537 --> 01:04:42.944
They don't seem to get the picture

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:44.703
to step the fuck off

01:04:44.704 --> 01:04:47.278
and let Joey get on with his life.

01:04:47.807 --> 01:04:49.663
I love those feet.

01:04:49.664 --> 01:04:51.679
See, that's where you guys come in.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.143
I mean, I can handle this
shit myself, no problem.

01:04:54.144 --> 01:04:56.382
Look at Big Poobah over there.

01:04:56.383 --> 01:04:58.814
He'll break somebody's fucking jaw.

01:04:58.815 --> 01:05:02.001
But I feel I need an outside
source to deal with this one for me.

01:05:04.255 --> 01:05:07.188
They're clean.

01:05:11.357 --> 01:05:13.341
So what are you guys looking for?

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:14.972
I got everything.

01:05:14.973 --> 01:05:18.012
And you're all checked
out, so we can deal.

01:05:18.013 --> 01:05:20.075
We're not sure.

01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:23.530
Hector. Take this.

01:05:27.452 --> 01:05:30.779
Look, it's very
dangerous, so be careful.

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.681
But if he thinks
you're a real buyer...

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.520
he'll meet with you.

01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:47.912
My babies.

01:05:55.193 --> 01:05:57.239
We got a Colt AR-15.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.191
It's a beautiful
piece of machinery.

01:05:59.192 --> 01:06:02.008
The military uses
it. Shoots a .223.

01:06:02.009 --> 01:06:03.928
It's nice and light,
easy to handle.

01:06:03.929 --> 01:06:05.495
Boom! Put it right up.

01:06:05.496 --> 01:06:07.044
I love it.

01:06:07.479 --> 01:06:10.295
Next we move onto the AK-47.

01:06:10.296 --> 01:06:12.886
It's my personal favorite.
It's a beautiful thing.

01:06:12.887 --> 01:06:14.965
Look at that. You can
never miss with this.

01:06:14.966 --> 01:06:16.854
You got a Kel-Tec 9mm carbine.

01:06:16.855 --> 01:06:19.925
You go inside the house,
anywhere... boom boom boom!

01:06:19.926 --> 01:06:21.525
And then...

01:06:21.526 --> 01:06:23.638
fold it up, put it behind your back

01:06:23.639 --> 01:06:25.909
It's all good, baby.
We got a Beretta 9.

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:28.117
We got a Sig Sauer.
We got the Raging Bull.

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:30.772
The bullet's as big as my pinky.
We got the Colt Desert Eagle.

01:06:30.773 --> 01:06:33.429
Look at this. Nice 25.
Gotta love it, baby.

01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:35.092
And when you're done, if
you run out of bullets,

01:06:35.093 --> 01:06:36.243
you hit 'em over the
head with it. I love it.

01:06:36.244 --> 01:06:37.555
Is this a freaking gun or what?

01:06:37.556 --> 01:06:38.836
Boom! Right in the
back of the head.

01:06:38.837 --> 01:06:40.811
Boom! Right there. Boom!

01:06:44.372 --> 01:06:47.906
Blow a hole in their head
the size of a bowling ball.

01:06:50.356 --> 01:06:52.647
So what do you think?

01:06:53.363 --> 01:06:55.185
How about we leave
it up to you what you

01:06:55.186 --> 01:06:57.193
wanna sell us this time?

01:06:57.843 --> 01:06:59.889
We send more business your way,

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.714
we ask you for one small favor.

01:07:01.715 --> 01:07:03.442
Favor? What are you talking about?

01:07:03.443 --> 01:07:05.713
A favor... leave
Joey "the Kid" alone.

01:07:05.714 --> 01:07:07.920
Give him a shot at
this career of his.

01:07:07.921 --> 01:07:11.825
You don't need him, but it couldn't
hurt having us in your corner.

01:07:11.826 --> 01:07:14.214
You know what I'm saying?

01:07:19.024 --> 01:07:21.151
You know what he's saying, right?

01:07:24.209 --> 01:07:28.004
You dogs crack me up.
You're serious, ain't you?

01:07:31.311 --> 01:07:33.340
Deal.

01:07:37.807 --> 01:07:39.901
Done.

01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:49.005
See? See?

01:07:49.006 --> 01:07:52.301
What I tell you, Ty? I told
you Bobby's dead serious,

01:07:52.302 --> 01:07:54.380
just like Tommy, man.

01:07:54.381 --> 01:07:57.468
You can really tell
he was your mentor.

01:07:59.436 --> 01:08:00.963
You earned this.

01:08:01.805 --> 01:08:03.564
How did you come up
with this information?

01:08:03.565 --> 01:08:05.035
I mean, it's unheard of.

01:08:05.036 --> 01:08:09.483
Jimmy. You know you
can't ask him that.

01:08:09.484 --> 01:08:12.459
Your boy's right. It's none
of your goddamn business.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:16.104
But since y'all are some hardcore
motherfuckers and did what I asked you,

01:08:16.106 --> 01:08:18.218
believe it or not,
I'm gonna tell you.

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:21.752
Only Tyler can make some
shit like this happen.

01:08:22.218 --> 01:08:23.962
So come on, tell us.

01:08:25.001 --> 01:08:27.740
No, fuck y'all. I ain't
telling y'all shit.

01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:32.600
All right, all right,
all right, listen.

01:08:33.578 --> 01:08:36.935
I'm banging this round-butt,
bigshot's assistant

01:08:36.935 --> 01:08:39.783
from the FBI WPP, okay?

01:08:39.785 --> 01:08:44.823
She told me where every confidential
informant has been relocated.

01:08:45.352 --> 01:08:46.854
And she's hot too, baby.

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:50.374
I'm talking about some dark
brown Trinidadian-type shit.

01:08:50.375 --> 01:08:54.022
Come on, man. Thank God the FBI
agreed to those minority quotas.

01:08:54.023 --> 01:08:56.377
Can I ask a little favor of you?

01:08:57.381 --> 01:08:59.429
A little favor?

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:02.437
You ain't got yourself one
big favor out of me already?

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:04.772
- Yo, fuck that... three?
- No, this is different.

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:06.500
See, I'm seeing this girl

01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:09.589
and she can sing...
I mean really sing.

01:09:09.988 --> 01:09:11.587
Kinda like Alicia Keys.

01:09:11.589 --> 01:09:14.020
- I was just thinking that maybe...
- Say no more.

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.930
I know where you're going.
You take her over to Willie.

01:09:16.932 --> 01:09:19.157
I got you. It's a done deal.

01:09:23.171 --> 01:09:26.946
Boy, you've got me and
I wanna be and I can...

01:09:26.947 --> 01:09:30.178
- Always.
- I hear you are a fabulous singer.

01:09:30.179 --> 01:09:32.514
- Bobby tells me you sing your ass off.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:09:32.515 --> 01:09:34.944
- She's way better than okay.
- We hear that. We hear that.

01:09:34.946 --> 01:09:36.578
- To you, Rena.
- All right.

01:09:36.578 --> 01:09:39.066
- Salute, girl.
- There we go. To Rena.

01:09:39.459 --> 01:09:41.057
Salute.

01:09:41.058 --> 01:09:42.946
It's good to see you again, Gina.

01:09:42.947 --> 01:09:44.865
Mmm. It's good to
see you too, Bobby.

01:09:44.866 --> 01:09:47.136
- It's been a really long time.
- Gina, you can't smoke in here.

01:09:47.138 --> 01:09:49.631
There's no smoking in this place.
It's disrespectful to Lenny.

01:09:49.633 --> 01:09:51.968
Lenny is fine with me smoking.
People are smoking here all the...

01:09:51.969 --> 01:09:53.953
- How about I'm not fine with it?
- Things have changed.

01:09:53.953 --> 01:09:56.063
You're being disrespectful to
Lenny and I fucking hate this.

01:09:56.064 --> 01:09:58.463
It's like kissing an ashtray. I told
you to put it out, now put it out.

01:09:58.464 --> 01:10:01.333
- It's like kissing an ashtray?
- You guys fighting all...

01:10:05.216 --> 01:10:07.135
- Maybe it's not so bad.
- Maybe a bit.

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:09.055
See, this is how she gets away

01:10:09.056 --> 01:10:11.006
with all this bullshit,
because she's hot.

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:12.703
- See? No matter what, she's hot.
- Oh.

01:10:12.704 --> 01:10:14.015
She's hot. I can't... right?

01:10:14.016 --> 01:10:16.286
I mean, all bullshit
aside, come on, tell me...

01:10:16.287 --> 01:10:17.934
is she hot or what?

01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:22.227
Come on, seriously, look at her.

01:10:22.846 --> 01:10:24.253
Look at his face.

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:25.724
I'm not gonna say that
about your girl, Jimmy.

01:10:25.725 --> 01:10:28.049
Bobby, you don't think I'm hot?

01:10:29.565 --> 01:10:30.908
Yeah.

01:10:30.909 --> 01:10:32.764
Yeah, you're definitely hot, Gina.

01:10:32.765 --> 01:10:34.492
- Oh, okay.
- Look, he's sweating.

01:10:34.493 --> 01:10:36.859
Look at him, he's sweating.
He's sweating over here.

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.843
I'm gonna cheers to that. To the
two hottest broads in the place.

01:10:38.844 --> 01:10:40.667
- I'll cheers to that as well.
- Rena and Gina.

01:10:40.668 --> 01:10:42.300
- Can we go soon, Bobby?
- It's like a tag-team match.

01:10:42.301 --> 01:10:43.828
Why?

01:10:44.221 --> 01:10:46.139
I'm tired.

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.707
You know what, Rena?
It's not a big deal.

01:10:47.708 --> 01:10:49.498
I actually need to go too.

01:10:49.499 --> 01:10:51.066
- Yo yeah, that's right.
- I gotta take care of that?

01:10:51.067 --> 01:10:52.826
Yeah. Don't leave
the other guy waiting.

01:10:52.827 --> 01:10:54.841
I shouldn't be late. All
right, so let's go, G.

01:10:54.842 --> 01:10:57.241
- Pack your stuff up.
- Yeah, of course.

01:10:57.242 --> 01:10:58.937
- Always got somewhere to go.
- Somebody's gotta earn

01:10:58.938 --> 01:11:00.985
to pay for all this
beautiful bottles and jewels.

01:11:00.986 --> 01:11:02.489
Rena, it was nice to meet you.

01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:04.568
Good luck when you
meet Willie Davis.

01:11:04.569 --> 01:11:06.360
I hope you guys
blow up. My brother.

01:11:06.361 --> 01:11:08.280
- I hope you have a beautiful thing.
- All right.

01:11:08.281 --> 01:11:10.168
- Gina, let's go.
- Great to see you, Bobby. Mwah.

01:11:10.169 --> 01:11:12.744
Nice meeting you, Rena.

01:11:15.416 --> 01:11:17.293
What's the matter?

01:11:18.329 --> 01:11:21.230
That girl Gina's phony.
I don't trust her with you.

01:11:22.425 --> 01:11:23.927
You're outta your mind?

01:11:23.928 --> 01:11:26.454
That's my best friend's girlfriend.

01:11:26.455 --> 01:11:28.502
- So?
- So?

01:11:28.503 --> 01:11:32.038
I would never ever, even if
she wanted to, which she don't.

01:11:32.887 --> 01:11:34.646
That's not the right answer, Bobby.

01:11:34.647 --> 01:11:37.557
The right answer is
"Why would I ever do

01:11:37.558 --> 01:11:39.381
something like that
when I have you?"

01:11:39.382 --> 01:11:41.014
Where's this coming from Rena?

01:11:41.015 --> 01:11:43.061
I didn't think you had
a jealous streak in you.

01:11:43.062 --> 01:11:45.222
I'm not jealous.

01:11:45.973 --> 01:11:47.796
Bobby, I really like you.

01:11:47.797 --> 01:11:50.568
I just need you to be honest.

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:53.076
I wasn't even supposed
to fall for you

01:11:53.077 --> 01:11:56.644
in the first place,
but... too late.

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.835
I'm not like that.

01:11:58.836 --> 01:12:01.160
You got nothing to worry about.

01:12:01.652 --> 01:12:03.092
Besides...

01:12:03.093 --> 01:12:05.731
why would I want
her when I have you?

01:12:08.531 --> 01:12:10.986
Now you say it.

01:12:36.433 --> 01:12:39.151
Hey, buddy. Are they biting today?

01:12:39.152 --> 01:12:42.502
Nah, didn't catch anything yet.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.789
Oh shit.

01:12:48.431 --> 01:12:50.670
I know my time is right now

01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:53.070
I can feel it in the air

01:12:53.071 --> 01:12:55.278
Don't know where
I'm going right now

01:12:55.279 --> 01:12:58.125
Just know I'm going somewhere

01:12:58.126 --> 01:12:59.853
I'm going somewhere

01:12:59.854 --> 01:13:02.342
Just know I'm going somewhere

01:13:04.845 --> 01:13:06.732
I'm going somewhere

01:13:06.733 --> 01:13:08.652
Yo, and I feel like
there's no limit

01:13:08.653 --> 01:13:10.572
I'm gonna make it only
if the Lord see Willy

01:13:10.573 --> 01:13:13.004
I can feel it in my
heart they gonna hate this

01:13:13.005 --> 01:13:14.987
But I know that I'm
destined for greatness

01:13:14.988 --> 01:13:17.227
And I'm gonna make
it, make it, believe it

01:13:17.228 --> 01:13:19.435
Open the eyes of those
who couldn't see me

01:13:19.436 --> 01:13:21.611
And I know every odd was against me

01:13:21.612 --> 01:13:23.307
But I'm gonna beat...

01:13:23.308 --> 01:13:26.442
So what do you want tonight?

01:13:26.443 --> 01:13:29.642
Everything, baby.
Everything you got.

01:13:29.643 --> 01:13:31.453
You ain't a cop, are ya?

01:13:32.427 --> 01:13:35.081
- Are you kidding me?
- Still don't stop me

01:13:35.082 --> 01:13:37.162
I'm still a movie y'all
haters keep watching

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:39.305
Home game, too far to turn back now

01:13:39.306 --> 01:13:41.769
I'm gonna make it one day, somehow

01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:43.945
I know my time is right now

01:13:43.946 --> 01:13:45.768
I can feel it in the air

01:13:45.769 --> 01:13:48.584
Don't know where
I'm going right now

01:13:48.585 --> 01:13:51.080
Just know I'm going somewhere

01:13:51.081 --> 01:13:55.771
I'm going somewhere, just
know I'm going somewhere

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.447
I'm going somewhere,
I put my all into everything

01:14:01.448 --> 01:14:03.783
When everything I felt,
they was never gonna change

01:14:03.784 --> 01:14:06.086
And stay the same, so
what should I change for?

01:14:06.087 --> 01:14:08.166
I just need something
positive to aim for

01:14:08.167 --> 01:14:10.150
And everything I
would do is so painful

01:14:10.151 --> 01:14:12.486
Everything I went through,
I'm kinda thankful...

01:14:12.487 --> 01:14:14.725
Oh, baby, don't stop
with the contact.

01:14:14.726 --> 01:14:17.029
I may be drunk,

01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:19.899
but I could swear I feel
some motion down there.

01:14:20.326 --> 01:14:22.933
Yeah, come on.

01:14:31.589 --> 01:14:35.188
So a guy walks into a bar.

01:14:35.844 --> 01:14:37.923
His necklace says "Jo-Jo."

01:14:37.924 --> 01:14:40.643
His bracelet says "Jo-Jo."

01:14:40.644 --> 01:14:43.363
Even his pinky ring says "Jo-Jo."

01:14:43.364 --> 01:14:46.402
A guy comes up to him
and he says, "Hey, Jo-Jo."

01:14:46.403 --> 01:14:51.443
He goes, "Shh. Nobody
knows I'm here."

01:15:13.473 --> 01:15:15.763
Hello, ball.

01:15:19.104 --> 01:15:21.559
Yeah.

01:15:43.518 --> 01:15:45.710
Shit.

01:16:16.058 --> 01:16:17.849
Big fucking tough guy, huh?

01:16:17.850 --> 01:16:19.897
Thought you'd find Johnny Morello

01:16:19.898 --> 01:16:22.505
and take care of
business that easily?

01:16:22.938 --> 01:16:25.359
Look at you now, tough guy.

01:16:26.137 --> 01:16:27.992
Go ahead, take a look at yourself.

01:16:27.993 --> 01:16:31.032
Put it down, Johnny,
you piece of shit.

01:16:31.033 --> 01:16:34.488
- I said put it down, Morello.
- All right, Bobby. Take it easy.

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:38.007
Look, I got money stashed away.

01:16:38.008 --> 01:16:40.215
Maybe me and you
could do something.

01:16:40.216 --> 01:16:42.326
Do what? Get the fuck outta here.

01:16:42.327 --> 01:16:44.630
- Put the gun down.
- All right, take it easy.

01:16:44.631 --> 01:16:46.870
Look, I'm putting it down, okay?

01:16:46.871 --> 01:16:48.342
Just calm down a bit, okay?

01:16:48.343 --> 01:16:50.666
Look, I'm putting it down.

01:16:51.063 --> 01:16:53.867
- Okay, can we talk?
- Now step away from the gun.

01:16:58.006 --> 01:17:00.373
Did you really think you
were gonna get away with it?

01:17:00.374 --> 01:17:02.229
Did you really think so?

01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:03.829
Bobby, listen,

01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:05.620
let me explain what happened, okay?

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.092
Explain what?

01:17:07.093 --> 01:17:09.364
How you're a dirty,
cheese-eating rat?

01:17:09.365 --> 01:17:11.412
You don't even give a
fuck that your old man is

01:17:11.413 --> 01:17:13.172
- gonna die in prison.
- Bobby, come on.

01:17:13.173 --> 01:17:15.187
L-let me explain, okay?

01:17:15.188 --> 01:17:17.811
Please. I'll give you
anything you want. Anything.

01:17:17.812 --> 01:17:21.203
Just don't do what you
came here to do, okay?

01:17:21.204 --> 01:17:23.379
Please. I'm begging you. Please.

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:26.066
What are you gonna
do? Get your pen?

01:17:26.067 --> 01:17:28.456
Gonna write about me some more?

01:17:29.683 --> 01:17:31.843
I'll give you something
to write about.

01:17:33.331 --> 01:17:35.569
Bobby, you didn't have to go...

01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:38.505
I still wanna be
able to talk this out.

01:17:54.896 --> 01:17:58.976
Fucking rat motherfucker!
Piece of shit!

01:17:59.536 --> 01:18:01.630
Fuck.

01:18:07.662 --> 01:18:08.878
You know something, Bobby?

01:18:08.879 --> 01:18:11.054
I enjoyed writing that book.

01:18:11.055 --> 01:18:14.404
I didn't think twice about
ratting you and your crew out.

01:18:14.926 --> 01:18:18.210
I could give a fuck about your
boy that I just killed over there.

01:18:21.166 --> 01:18:23.195
You're next, Baldano.

01:18:38.764 --> 01:18:41.698
Always got your back, Bobby.

01:19:26.374 --> 01:19:28.774
- You read it?
- No.

01:19:28.775 --> 01:19:30.886
I look at the cover every day.

01:19:30.887 --> 01:19:34.781
I won't open it. I can't
bring myself to read that.

01:19:35.814 --> 01:19:37.573
You're through with this?

01:19:37.574 --> 01:19:39.429
I'll tell you when
you're through with this.

01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:41.189
What, do you think you're
gonna go out there on your own?

01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:43.493
That's not gonna happen.
You belong over here.

01:19:43.494 --> 01:19:44.836
You know something, Bobby?

01:19:44.837 --> 01:19:46.948
I enjoyed writing that book.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.796
I didn't think twice about
ratting you and your crew out.

01:19:49.797 --> 01:19:52.324
- It's not like that.
- No, it is like that.

01:19:52.325 --> 01:19:54.307
You choose that life. That life.

01:19:54.308 --> 01:19:57.012
That's the life you choose.

01:20:01.764 --> 01:20:03.747
May you burn in hell

01:20:03.748 --> 01:20:06.867
if you deceive
anyone in this family.

01:20:12.515 --> 01:20:15.265
Come on. Did you really think

01:20:15.266 --> 01:20:17.841
this wasn't going to
point to you, Baldano?

01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:21.600
I gotta hand it to you though.

01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:23.892
How'd you find 'em?

01:20:24.354 --> 01:20:26.272
Find who?

01:20:26.273 --> 01:20:28.544
What are you talking about?

01:20:28.545 --> 01:20:30.720
Oh, so it was just a
coincidence that the same

01:20:30.721 --> 01:20:33.311
three guys that brought you and
your buddies down turned up dead.

01:20:33.312 --> 01:20:36.287
Dead? Really?

01:20:36.288 --> 01:20:38.783
- Come on.
- You think you made history, don't you?

01:20:38.784 --> 01:20:40.638
Listen, I got things to do,

01:20:40.639 --> 01:20:43.070
so if you're gonna
arrest me for no reason,

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:46.141
- let's just get it over with.
- No reason?

01:20:46.142 --> 01:20:48.477
We could've taken you in
months ago for breaking parole

01:20:48.478 --> 01:20:51.518
just for walking into that piece of
shit Patsy's dump of a social club

01:20:51.519 --> 01:20:53.918
or for associating with your
buddies out in broad daylight.

01:20:53.919 --> 01:20:55.837
What, do you think
we're stupid, Baldano?

01:20:55.838 --> 01:20:59.869
Nah. We kept you on
the street for a reason.

01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:03.901
Come on, practically the whole
Carana crime family is away now.

01:21:03.902 --> 01:21:06.715
You'll be joining them
soon enough, Baldano.

01:21:06.716 --> 01:21:08.827
That's what you think, Benson.

01:21:08.828 --> 01:21:11.355
- I ain't ever going back.
- Really?

01:21:11.356 --> 01:21:12.988
- You hear that?
- Mmm.

01:21:12.989 --> 01:21:14.635
He ain't ever going back.

01:21:15.676 --> 01:21:17.083
That Jew bastard.

01:21:17.084 --> 01:21:18.842
I want him dead.

01:21:18.843 --> 01:21:20.443
We need to get rid of him.

01:21:20.444 --> 01:21:23.642
He has a big mouth,
kids around too much.

01:21:23.643 --> 01:21:25.882
He's weak. He's gotta go.

01:21:25.883 --> 01:21:28.239
Take care of it, Jimmy.

01:21:36.954 --> 01:21:38.073
Come on.

01:21:38.074 --> 01:21:40.537
Guys, that might've
worked with Sammy the Bull.

01:21:40.538 --> 01:21:42.105
It ain't gonna work with me.

01:21:42.106 --> 01:21:43.577
What do you think,
I was born yesterday?

01:21:43.578 --> 01:21:45.944
I mean, at least you could've done

01:21:45.945 --> 01:21:49.016
a better job with the...
with the sound splicing.

01:21:49.017 --> 01:21:51.096
I got a nephew who went to NYU.

01:21:51.097 --> 01:21:53.432
He could've done a
better job with that.

01:21:53.433 --> 01:21:57.015
- I'll give you his number.
- Think you're that tight with Baldano?

01:21:57.016 --> 01:21:59.656
Let's get them the fuck outta here.

01:22:00.055 --> 01:22:01.637
Pleasure.

01:22:02.072 --> 01:22:04.711
Yeah, a pleasure.

01:22:06.615 --> 01:22:08.374
Motherfucker did what?

01:22:08.375 --> 01:22:11.593
They got brought
in for questioning.

01:22:12.215 --> 01:22:14.342
So what happened? Did they talk?

01:22:15.958 --> 01:22:18.500
These motherfuckers rats too?

01:22:19.253 --> 01:22:20.980
What do you mean you
don't know, bitch?

01:22:20.981 --> 01:22:22.388
You're supposed to know everything.

01:22:22.389 --> 01:22:25.541
Find out. I don't
believe this shit.

01:22:31.157 --> 01:22:34.452
What with this guy? Does he
always make you wait this long?

01:22:34.453 --> 01:22:36.147
What's up with you, Bobby?

01:22:36.148 --> 01:22:39.082
You're not acting
like yourself lately.

01:22:40.435 --> 01:22:42.180
What's up?

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:43.955
Nothing's up.

01:22:43.956 --> 01:22:45.425
Everything's the same.

01:22:45.426 --> 01:22:48.178
The same? The same, Bobby?

01:22:48.179 --> 01:22:50.929
You don't even try to
hold my hand anymore.

01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:53.298
When we first met, you
couldn't wait to get me in bed.

01:22:53.299 --> 01:22:54.897
And now when we're in bed together,

01:22:54.898 --> 01:22:56.913
all you do is sleep
or toss and turn...

01:22:56.914 --> 01:22:58.385
- Oh.
- ...and yell shit out.

01:22:58.386 --> 01:22:59.665
Now I'm not satisfying you?

01:22:59.666 --> 01:23:01.193
It's not that.

01:23:02.705 --> 01:23:04.975
You could've had a good thing,

01:23:04.976 --> 01:23:06.703
a fresh start

01:23:06.704 --> 01:23:09.104
with your family, with me.

01:23:09.105 --> 01:23:11.330
With everything.

01:23:12.304 --> 01:23:13.871
A person like you can't handle

01:23:13.872 --> 01:23:15.854
having a good thing in their life,

01:23:15.855 --> 01:23:18.863
like you don't want to
believe it's possible.

01:23:18.864 --> 01:23:20.623
And that's sad, Bobby.

01:23:20.624 --> 01:23:23.264
That's really sad.

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.605
What took you so long?

01:23:42.606 --> 01:23:44.579
You gonna get on or what?

01:23:45.004 --> 01:23:46.827
I guess. All right.

01:23:46.828 --> 01:23:51.948
Baby, some place it's getting dark

01:23:51.949 --> 01:23:54.028
Are you afraid...

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:55.979
Lemme get another
shot of Jack, Lenny.

01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:59.242
Of what this could start?

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:00.843
Just forget what
you've been told...

01:24:00.844 --> 01:24:03.338
You ever think
about the end, Lenny?

01:24:03.339 --> 01:24:05.769
In the end, who really cares?

01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:08.841
Remember that girl Maria I
was seeing back in the day?

01:24:08.842 --> 01:24:11.946
How could I forget Maria Maruso?

01:24:11.947 --> 01:24:15.177
Dark hair, dark eyes.

01:24:15.178 --> 01:24:17.609
You told me she even
had dark nipples.

01:24:17.610 --> 01:24:19.208
Ooh, she was hot, that one.

01:24:19.209 --> 01:24:21.001
Yeah, they're all hot

01:24:21.002 --> 01:24:23.400
and they all wanna be
around when the chips are up.

01:24:23.401 --> 01:24:25.415
Where was she when I got pinched?

01:24:25.416 --> 01:24:28.264
She never came and
seen me. Nobody did.

01:24:28.265 --> 01:24:30.359
Not even you.

01:24:30.984 --> 01:24:32.999
Well, I... you know...

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.622
I had the business to run.
You know how that can be.

01:24:35.623 --> 01:24:36.934
Bullshit, Lenny.

01:24:36.935 --> 01:24:38.983
All that time?

01:24:38.984 --> 01:24:41.126
You couldn't come see
me in all that time?

01:24:41.127 --> 01:24:43.879
What? Think I don't know
you went to see Jimmy?

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.846
Jimmy, but not me?

01:24:50.214 --> 01:24:52.006
I don't know what to say, Bobby.

01:24:52.007 --> 01:24:55.737
There's nothing to say. You're
just like the rest of them.

01:24:56.741 --> 01:24:58.373
The one person that
came and seen me,

01:24:58.374 --> 01:25:01.636
that really cared, was my father.

01:25:01.637 --> 01:25:04.835
Look at me. I'm a fuck-up to him.

01:25:04.836 --> 01:25:06.660
- A loser.
- Come on, come on.

01:25:06.661 --> 01:25:09.059
Don't beat yourself up like
that. It's gonna be all right.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.235
- You're not a loser.
- Don't tell me it's all right.

01:25:11.236 --> 01:25:13.475
Just pour me another fucking drink.

01:25:13.476 --> 01:25:15.450
That's all you're good for.

01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:20.983
Make that two.

01:25:26.019 --> 01:25:28.407
Gina.

01:25:31.171 --> 01:25:33.015
So...

01:25:37.249 --> 01:25:39.488
have you seen Jimmy boy?

01:25:39.489 --> 01:25:42.456
I think he's still with Stan.

01:25:43.810 --> 01:25:46.688
You don't have to cover for him,
Bobby. I know he's cheating on me.

01:25:46.689 --> 01:25:48.960
What? Cheating on you?

01:25:48.961 --> 01:25:51.232
Don't talk that shit to me, Gina.

01:25:51.233 --> 01:25:54.734
Well, I gotta lock up,
but you two take your time.

01:26:03.167 --> 01:26:04.846
Thing is...

01:26:05.918 --> 01:26:08.045
I don't care.

01:26:08.638 --> 01:26:10.318
I don't care.

01:26:11.454 --> 01:26:15.315
That there's nothing
truer than me...

01:26:17.917 --> 01:26:20.077
Cut it out.

01:26:20.605 --> 01:26:22.896
Oh, Bobby.

01:26:24.093 --> 01:26:27.708
Gina, that shit
don't fly around here.

01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:29.563
You're just upset. You're drinking.

01:26:29.564 --> 01:26:31.388
You don't know what you're saying.

01:26:31.389 --> 01:26:35.322
Bobby, I very much
know what I'm saying.

01:26:35.323 --> 01:26:37.786
I should slap you in the
face for talking like that.

01:26:37.787 --> 01:26:39.914
So do it.

01:26:40.411 --> 01:26:42.234
Don't fucking test me, Gina.

01:26:42.235 --> 01:26:43.706
Why? What's the matter?

01:26:43.707 --> 01:26:45.625
You've never hit a girl before?

01:26:45.626 --> 01:26:48.168
What, are you chicken?

01:26:48.986 --> 01:26:50.568
Are you out of your mind?

01:26:51.003 --> 01:26:52.551
Ow.

01:26:52.954 --> 01:26:53.978
What's the matter?

01:26:53.979 --> 01:26:55.928
- You're hurting me.
- You said you liked it rough.

01:26:55.929 --> 01:26:57.369
- No, Bobby.
- You said you wanted me to hit you.

01:26:57.370 --> 01:26:59.825
You're fucking hurting me, Bobby!

01:27:07.161 --> 01:27:08.791
I'm sorry.

01:27:08.792 --> 01:27:11.247
I've... I've been a bad girl.

01:27:13.848 --> 01:27:15.766
I'm sorry.

01:27:15.767 --> 01:27:17.750
Please don't...

01:27:17.751 --> 01:27:20.326
spank me.

01:27:21.464 --> 01:27:23.852
You wouldn't spank me, would you?

01:27:24.918 --> 01:27:26.645
- What?
- Is that what you're gonna do?

01:27:26.646 --> 01:27:28.195
This what you want?

01:27:34.965 --> 01:27:36.874
Fucking do it.

01:27:40.117 --> 01:27:42.408
Do it.

01:27:50.261 --> 01:27:52.355
What the fuck am I doing?

01:27:52.916 --> 01:27:55.141
Fucking do it, Bobby.

01:27:56.532 --> 01:27:58.059
Fuck it.

01:28:25.456 --> 01:28:28.271
He thinks he can just disappear
like this whenever he feels like it?

01:28:28.272 --> 01:28:31.695
I was faithful to that prick
the whole time he was in prison.

01:28:31.696 --> 01:28:35.279
Yeah, I visited him
every fucking week.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.102
Yeah, well, let me
tell you something...

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:38.990
he's gonna be fucking
sorry, that Jimmy V.

01:28:38.991 --> 01:28:42.558
He fucked with the wrong
bitch one too many times.

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:48.141
Hold on a sec. Come
on, best out of three.

01:28:48.142 --> 01:28:50.093
- Man, best out of three?
- Come on, best out of three.

01:28:50.094 --> 01:28:51.917
You couldn't beat
me on your best day.

01:28:51.918 --> 01:28:53.741
You would think you would
learn how to play this game,

01:28:53.742 --> 01:28:55.437
being inside for
as long as you were.

01:28:55.438 --> 01:28:57.420
All right, it's point game, spaz.

01:28:57.421 --> 01:28:59.308
Yeah, I can count,
Jimmy. I can count, okay?

01:28:59.309 --> 01:29:00.908
That's right.
I forgot you're a Jew.

01:29:00.909 --> 01:29:03.069
Oh yes, that's very original.

01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:10.347
Victory!

01:29:10.348 --> 01:29:13.035
Victory! You suck, bro.

01:29:13.036 --> 01:29:15.114
Jimmy rules.

01:29:15.115 --> 01:29:17.994
That's it, Bobby bro.
You're up next, baby.

01:29:17.995 --> 01:29:19.435
Get a little warmed up.

01:29:19.436 --> 01:29:21.066
Lemme just get a little water here.

01:29:21.067 --> 01:29:23.050
Kicking his ass has
got me a little parched.

01:29:23.051 --> 01:29:24.649
Yeah, I don't know, Jimmy.

01:29:24.650 --> 01:29:26.858
I don't feel much
like playing tonight.

01:29:26.859 --> 01:29:29.117
I just had a workout at the gym.

01:29:29.514 --> 01:29:31.194
Eh.

01:29:47.304 --> 01:29:49.279
Get down!

01:29:57.255 --> 01:30:00.376
- Fuck! Stan!
- Stan!

01:30:00.967 --> 01:30:02.843
Stan!

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:29.908
What the fuck?

01:31:03.329 --> 01:31:05.488
I can't see through...

01:31:24.958 --> 01:31:26.965
I can't do this.

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:48.169
Rena. Rena.

01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:52.315
What?

01:31:52.316 --> 01:31:54.714
- What's wrong?
- You think I'm stupid, Bobby?

01:31:54.715 --> 01:31:57.242
You think I'm blind?

01:31:57.243 --> 01:31:59.258
You think people don't talk?

01:31:59.259 --> 01:32:01.082
I can't believe I was such an idiot

01:32:01.083 --> 01:32:04.250
to lower myself to be with
such a pathetic jailbird.

01:32:04.251 --> 01:32:07.257
- Jailbird?
- You're a lowlife, Bobby.

01:32:07.258 --> 01:32:09.647
Gina?

01:32:13.530 --> 01:32:16.216
Hey, Bobby, everything all right?

01:32:16.217 --> 01:32:17.929
Yeah yeah.

01:32:19.193 --> 01:32:21.560
- Where's Rena going?
- Just went for a walk.

01:32:21.561 --> 01:32:24.300
It was too much for her in there.

01:32:26.392 --> 01:32:28.631
If only Stan could see us now,

01:32:28.632 --> 01:32:30.455
wearing these skullcaps for him.

01:32:30.456 --> 01:32:34.405
He can see us. You
can count on that.

01:32:36.439 --> 01:32:41.098
Oh my God. What did I do?

01:32:41.655 --> 01:32:42.870
Talk to you later.
I got something I gotta do.

01:32:42.871 --> 01:32:44.629
- Yeah.
- Come on, baby. Let's go.

01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:47.085
He really does love this girl.

01:32:48.406 --> 01:32:50.485
You know it wasn't gonna end here.

01:32:50.486 --> 01:32:52.885
But Stan getting dropped like that,

01:32:52.886 --> 01:32:55.444
I was just hoping it
wasn't gonna start something

01:32:55.445 --> 01:32:58.085
that was never gonna end.

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:05.491
What's up with you tonight, man?

01:33:05.492 --> 01:33:07.347
You're squirming around,
grabbing your nuts

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:09.907
like they're gonna
run away or some shit.

01:33:09.908 --> 01:33:11.283
I gotta take a piss.

01:33:11.284 --> 01:33:13.509
Well, go take a piss.

01:33:14.228 --> 01:33:16.210
- You gonna be okay?
- I'm good.

01:33:16.211 --> 01:33:18.469
You're sure?

01:33:19.187 --> 01:33:21.266
Go to the bathroom. I'm okay.

01:33:21.267 --> 01:33:23.922
Go. Come on, let me enjoy my meal.

01:33:23.923 --> 01:33:25.929
A'ight.

01:34:14.381 --> 01:34:17.804
That was it. It was
time to call it quits.

01:34:17.805 --> 01:34:19.756
I mean, who was left?

01:34:19.757 --> 01:34:21.818
What was left?

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:35.361
Bobby.

01:34:36.043 --> 01:34:38.269
I have something to
say to you and Dad.

01:34:42.379 --> 01:34:45.897
I'm done. I'm done with
this life I'm living.

01:34:45.898 --> 01:34:49.400
I know that's what you want.

01:34:49.801 --> 01:34:51.593
Well, now finally,

01:34:51.594 --> 01:34:54.299
it's what I want too.

01:34:55.881 --> 01:34:59.034
Dad, I wanna come work for you.

01:35:00.137 --> 01:35:03.006
I'd like to be a part
of Baldano & Sons.

01:35:04.105 --> 01:35:05.703
Yeah?

01:35:05.704 --> 01:35:08.583
You wanna work for me now?

01:35:08.584 --> 01:35:11.257
You know what I heard the DA say?

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.150
He said there's no way
an Italian immigrant

01:35:14.151 --> 01:35:16.262
coming from Italy with less
than two nickels to rub together

01:35:16.263 --> 01:35:18.310
could possibly rise
to the affluence

01:35:18.311 --> 01:35:20.358
of Baldano & Sons

01:35:20.359 --> 01:35:24.188
without corruption being involved.

01:35:26.694 --> 01:35:29.669
You know that word? Corruption?

01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:33.541
Corruption? That's bullshit,
Dad, and you know it.

01:35:33.542 --> 01:35:35.971
No. You know what's
bullshit, Bobby?

01:35:35.972 --> 01:35:38.660
What's bullshit is that my father,

01:35:38.661 --> 01:35:41.188
your grandfather,
came here from nothing.

01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:43.555
And he broke his ass

01:35:43.556 --> 01:35:46.499
every day of his life

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.419
to hold onto the one little thing

01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:51.354
he held in esteem.

01:35:51.972 --> 01:35:54.034
And that was his name...

01:35:54.851 --> 01:35:58.680
which is engraved on Ellis Island.

01:35:59.107 --> 01:36:00.290
And you, on the other hand, Bobby,

01:36:00.291 --> 01:36:02.306
you never worked one
fucking day in your life.

01:36:02.307 --> 01:36:04.609
But you took his
name, you took my name

01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:06.113
and you pissed on it.

01:36:06.114 --> 01:36:08.065
Which is consistent
with you, Bobby.

01:36:08.066 --> 01:36:09.857
That's what you do...
you piss on people,

01:36:09.858 --> 01:36:11.585
'cause you got no spine,

01:36:11.586 --> 01:36:13.648
no backbone!

01:36:15.809 --> 01:36:18.776
That's why I'm being indicted.

01:36:20.097 --> 01:36:21.941
Indicted?

01:36:26.208 --> 01:36:28.831
Yeah. You didn't hear what
I said? I've been indicted!

01:36:28.832 --> 01:36:30.303
Joseph, please, it's not his fault.

01:36:30.304 --> 01:36:32.223
- Just give him one...
- Run this by me again.

01:36:32.224 --> 01:36:34.271
You want me to do what?
You want me to risk

01:36:34.272 --> 01:36:35.550
the reputation of
this family again?

01:36:35.551 --> 01:36:37.790
For what? Take you back into fold

01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:40.606
'cause you got
redemption issues? Hmm?

01:36:40.607 --> 01:36:43.825
What happened to that
life you chose to live?

01:36:44.223 --> 01:36:46.173
You don't wanna live it?

01:36:46.174 --> 01:36:47.901
Then I'll tell you what.

01:36:47.902 --> 01:36:51.229
- Dad. Come on.
- You... you be mama's boy

01:36:51.230 --> 01:36:52.893
and you be my kid.

01:36:52.894 --> 01:36:54.428
- You are never again, Bobby...
- Dad.

01:36:54.429 --> 01:36:57.582
ever welcome in this home.

01:36:58.493 --> 01:37:01.084
Joseph, no more.

01:37:01.085 --> 01:37:03.579
And as far as my company...

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:06.907
not in your wildest dreams.

01:37:06.908 --> 01:37:08.699
Joseph, please,

01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:10.747
- for me.
- You call yourself my son?

01:37:10.748 --> 01:37:12.411
Give him another chance, okay?

01:37:12.412 --> 01:37:15.162
We'll beat this indictment.
We didn't do anything wrong.

01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:18.042
- You know what else we got in common?
- We run a clean business.

01:37:18.043 --> 01:37:19.545
They'll find nothing.

01:37:19.546 --> 01:37:21.805
We got shame.

01:37:23.290 --> 01:37:25.264
Good old fucking shame.

01:37:29.082 --> 01:37:31.689
All of us now.

01:37:32.281 --> 01:37:34.408
All of us.

01:37:35.768 --> 01:37:38.027
Except I'm done.

01:37:39.321 --> 01:37:41.808
Get the fuck outta my house.

01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:18.836
Joseph, you didn't have to do that.

01:38:18.837 --> 01:38:21.477
He's still our son.

01:38:25.075 --> 01:38:27.283
He's gonna kill himself
in that car of his

01:38:27.284 --> 01:38:31.219
and you will never be able
to forgive yourself for it.

01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:34.291
Did you hear the way he
pulled out of the driveway?

01:38:34.292 --> 01:38:37.476
- Fuck!
- He's never done something like that.

01:38:39.251 --> 01:38:41.509
I mean, not before.

01:38:44.433 --> 01:38:46.113
Not like that!

01:38:51.474 --> 01:38:53.022
Yo!

01:38:53.777 --> 01:38:55.838
Where the fuck you learn
how to drive, homes?

01:38:58.832 --> 01:39:01.188
What do you expect
from a fucking guinea?

01:39:01.585 --> 01:39:04.486
This dude thinks he's
Mario fucking Andretti.

01:39:14.638 --> 01:39:16.494
What you just say, Julio?

01:39:16.495 --> 01:39:19.085
- Huh? You want some?
- I'm on probation, homes.

01:39:19.086 --> 01:39:21.998
- Come on.
- This guy's crazy. Look at his eyes.

01:39:21.999 --> 01:39:23.885
I'm outta here. You're on your own.

01:39:23.886 --> 01:39:26.427
Come on, fucker. Come on.

01:39:27.565 --> 01:39:29.474
Just you and me now.

01:39:30.670 --> 01:39:34.237
Come on. Let's see what you got.

01:39:37.197 --> 01:39:39.787
Come on, motherfucker. Huh?

01:39:39.788 --> 01:39:42.079
Huh? Huh?

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:47.339
What, spic? What? Come on.

01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.762
Come on, cocksucker.

01:40:04.393 --> 01:40:07.049
Come on, spic! Call me a guinea?

01:40:07.050 --> 01:40:08.926
Come on!

01:40:33.032 --> 01:40:35.685
- You could've had a good thing.
- You choose that life. That life.

01:40:35.686 --> 01:40:36.966
A fresh start.

01:40:36.967 --> 01:40:39.398
We kept you on the
street for a reason.

01:40:39.399 --> 01:40:41.541
I'm through with this. I'm done.

01:40:41.542 --> 01:40:43.557
You have no choice.

01:40:43.558 --> 01:40:45.445
You know what else
we got in common?

01:40:45.446 --> 01:40:47.988
- No.
- We got shame.

01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:50.517
All of us now.

01:40:52.678 --> 01:40:55.251
Hey, Bobby boy.

01:40:57.604 --> 01:41:00.227
You coming out of it or what?

01:41:00.228 --> 01:41:02.650
Come on.

01:41:03.429 --> 01:41:05.186
You know you're all right, right?

01:41:05.187 --> 01:41:06.883
You're not missing nothing...

01:41:06.884 --> 01:41:08.483
well, except for your dick.

01:41:08.484 --> 01:41:10.786
But the doctor said they
kept Little Mikey's on ice

01:41:10.787 --> 01:41:12.418
when they found him in the lake,

01:41:12.419 --> 01:41:14.658
so we can always just get
'em to sew his back on you.

01:41:14.659 --> 01:41:17.364
Fuck you, Jimmy.

01:41:20.098 --> 01:41:23.777
My car. My Goat.

01:41:23.778 --> 01:41:26.166
Is it wrecked?

01:41:26.561 --> 01:41:28.143
Your Goat...

01:41:28.577 --> 01:41:29.984
she's another story.

01:41:29.985 --> 01:41:31.456
She's just a piece of metal,

01:41:31.457 --> 01:41:34.495
but you can just
rebuild another one.

01:41:34.496 --> 01:41:36.623
Not like that one, Jimmy.

01:41:37.024 --> 01:41:39.380
Not like that one.

01:41:40.352 --> 01:41:43.904
Hey, is my family around?

01:41:43.905 --> 01:41:46.079
Yeah, sure. They
were all here earlier.

01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:48.030
But you've been out
cold for two days, pal.

01:41:48.031 --> 01:41:49.854
I sent 'em home, told
'em to take a break,

01:41:49.855 --> 01:41:51.454
that I'd take care of ya.

01:41:51.455 --> 01:41:54.302
Doc said you're good
to go. You can go home.

01:41:54.303 --> 01:41:55.870
You're just banged up a little...

01:41:55.871 --> 01:41:57.854
some bumps and bruises,
mild concussion.

01:41:57.855 --> 01:41:59.389
Lemme tell you something...

01:41:59.390 --> 01:42:01.309
you are one lucky bastard, Baldano.

01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:03.773
I'll just go get the nurse,
have her get you dressed

01:42:03.774 --> 01:42:05.596
and we're outta here. All right?

01:42:05.597 --> 01:42:07.342
I'll be right back.

01:42:16.316 --> 01:42:18.876
Okay, I'm gonna call down
to get you a wheelchair

01:42:18.877 --> 01:42:21.531
to get you out of the hospital
safely and then you can go home. Hmm?

01:42:21.532 --> 01:42:23.995
No no no no no, there's
no way this box of nails

01:42:23.996 --> 01:42:26.139
is gonna get seen being wheeled
out of this place in a wheelchair.

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:29.019
Sir, it is standard procedure
for car accident patients.

01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:31.049
I can't break the rules.

01:42:32.316 --> 01:42:36.395
Enough with the rules and
stop calling me "sir," will ya?

01:42:40.314 --> 01:42:43.598
I just need him to sign
himself out of the hospital.

01:42:51.769 --> 01:42:54.027
Thank you.

01:42:55.384 --> 01:42:57.655
All right, I took care
of the janitor too.

01:42:57.656 --> 01:42:59.544
We're gonna go out through
the freight elevator.

01:42:59.545 --> 01:43:01.464
You never know. You still may
have some enemies out there.

01:43:01.465 --> 01:43:04.933
- Take this.
- What the fuck, Jimmy?

01:43:05.496 --> 01:43:07.542
- In a hospital?
- So what?

01:43:07.543 --> 01:43:10.380
It's your piece anyway. You're
gonna feel naked without it.

01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:20.054
- You guys ready?
- No, it's all right.

01:43:20.055 --> 01:43:21.462
We can handle it from here.

01:43:21.463 --> 01:43:23.829
Just remember, you didn't see us.

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:27.277
- Hey, no problem.
- Mmm.

01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:38.312
- Aren't we going through the lobby?
- No, it's safer this way.

01:43:39.188 --> 01:43:41.447
Always thinking.

01:43:44.371 --> 01:43:45.650
I'm done, Jimmy.

01:43:45.651 --> 01:43:48.259
Done? What you mean, done?

01:43:48.723 --> 01:43:50.067
Just what I said.

01:43:50.068 --> 01:43:52.050
I'm done.

01:43:52.051 --> 01:43:53.651
I've had it with this shit.

01:43:53.652 --> 01:43:56.145
I ain't going back to the can.

01:43:56.146 --> 01:43:58.098
I can feel it, Jimmy.

01:43:58.099 --> 01:44:00.849
I'm gonna end up
right back in there,

01:44:00.850 --> 01:44:03.817
maybe for good this time.

01:44:04.497 --> 01:44:07.334
Just think of this as a pass.

01:44:07.985 --> 01:44:10.321
Wow. You're serious.

01:44:10.322 --> 01:44:12.580
I'm dead serious, Jimmy.

01:44:13.298 --> 01:44:17.541
Thing is, I already
burned too many bridges.

01:44:18.257 --> 01:44:20.016
I've still got you though.

01:44:20.017 --> 01:44:21.967
We could start fresh.

01:44:21.968 --> 01:44:24.869
We could go somewhere else.

01:44:25.263 --> 01:44:26.543
Go legit.

01:44:26.544 --> 01:44:28.686
Can you imagine that?

01:44:28.687 --> 01:44:32.135
You and me, legit.

01:44:33.264 --> 01:44:35.389
What do you say?

01:44:41.486 --> 01:44:43.297
Jimmy.

01:44:44.078 --> 01:44:45.644
I'm serious.

01:44:45.645 --> 01:44:48.928
I know you're serious, Bobby.

01:44:50.125 --> 01:44:52.765
And I was serious about this.

01:44:57.005 --> 01:44:59.180
It don't matter that
I didn't pay for it.

01:44:59.181 --> 01:45:01.821
It still would've
meant the same thing.

01:45:02.476 --> 01:45:04.417
I wanted out too.

01:45:05.451 --> 01:45:10.044
And I had my plans
for my life, but you...

01:45:11.563 --> 01:45:14.569
I guess you had other
plans for me, didn't ya?

01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:16.458
Come on, Jimmy.

01:45:16.459 --> 01:45:18.537
What did she tell you?

01:45:18.538 --> 01:45:20.681
You know that broad
talks a lot of shit.

01:45:20.682 --> 01:45:24.552
You don't wanna marry
her, not a girl like that.

01:45:24.553 --> 01:45:27.128
A girl like what, Bobby?

01:45:28.009 --> 01:45:30.016
A girl like what?

01:45:32.969 --> 01:45:34.951
Where was she when I got pinched?

01:45:34.952 --> 01:45:37.895
She never came and
seen me. Nobody did.

01:45:37.896 --> 01:45:39.559
Not even you.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:42.439
I had the business to run.
You know how that can be.

01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:44.358
Bullshit, Lenny.

01:45:44.359 --> 01:45:46.150
Think I don't know
you went to see Jimmy?

01:45:46.151 --> 01:45:49.402
Jimmy, but not me?

01:46:00.198 --> 01:46:02.009
Russo.

01:46:03.366 --> 01:46:05.274
Yeah.

01:46:06.245 --> 01:46:08.997
Oh, he'll be here.
Doesn't miss a day.

01:46:08.998 --> 01:46:10.852
The son?

01:46:10.853 --> 01:46:12.548
He doesn't have much of a choice.

01:46:12.549 --> 01:46:14.467
But him? I don't know.

01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:16.483
Something keeps him coming back.

01:46:16.484 --> 01:46:19.043
One of these days I'm gonna
figure out just what that is,

01:46:19.044 --> 01:46:22.841
and I'm gonna finally
nail that son of a bitch.

01:46:24.292 --> 01:46:27.266
Loyalty? I mean, come on.

01:46:27.267 --> 01:46:29.763
I have to be here.

01:46:29.764 --> 01:46:32.930
I have to spend time
amongst my so-called friends.

01:46:32.931 --> 01:46:36.609
- Good morning, son.
- Good morning, Dad.

01:46:36.610 --> 01:46:38.402
But my father?

01:46:38.403 --> 01:46:41.337
He can forget this
place even exists.

01:46:41.794 --> 01:46:44.084
But he don't.

01:46:47.042 --> 01:46:49.952
I never knew what
loyalty really was

01:46:49.953 --> 01:46:52.224
until I finally
understood my father

01:46:52.225 --> 01:46:54.482
and what he stood for.

01:46:55.968 --> 01:47:00.180
But by then, it was too late.

01:47:05.951 --> 01:47:08.638
Blanks. Jimmy
thought of everything.

01:47:08.639 --> 01:47:10.590
He loaded my gun with blanks.

01:47:10.591 --> 01:47:12.446
He tested me,

01:47:12.447 --> 01:47:13.982
and I fell for it

01:47:13.983 --> 01:47:15.838
'cause I trusted him.

01:47:15.839 --> 01:47:19.122
Well, he trusted me too.

01:47:19.838 --> 01:47:20.957
So in the end,

01:47:20.958 --> 01:47:22.558
who can you really trust

01:47:22.559 --> 01:47:24.980
but your own family?

01:47:30.237 --> 01:47:34.765
Comes a certain time in the night

01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:41.038
You question everything
you thought was so right

01:47:43.325 --> 01:47:48.233
Your head dances
like a spinning top

01:47:48.955 --> 01:47:50.682
Come this time

01:47:50.683 --> 01:47:54.106
You're not too sure what you got

01:47:54.107 --> 01:47:57.177
Ain't it so?

01:47:57.178 --> 01:48:01.465
Ain't it so?

01:48:01.466 --> 01:48:03.385
Pray for the morning

01:48:03.386 --> 01:48:06.744
You pray for the morning

01:48:06.745 --> 01:48:10.744
And it's a mercy life

01:48:10.745 --> 01:48:12.971
Singing alone.

01:48:33.143 --> 01:48:35.477
One shell in the chamber

01:48:35.478 --> 01:48:38.357
- Get it ready and cocked
- Y'all ready for this?

01:48:38.358 --> 01:48:40.341
One pull on the trigger

01:48:40.342 --> 01:48:42.997
- Can I do it or not?
- Can I do it or not?

01:48:42.998 --> 01:48:45.076
Galvanize with so much sorrow

01:48:45.077 --> 01:48:47.188
Desolation's my only friend

01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:49.780
Feel the pulse in my heart,
feel the grip of my hand

01:48:49.781 --> 01:48:53.064
One pull of the trigger,
the insanity ends

01:49:10.099 --> 01:49:12.466
Melancholia, it kills me slowly

01:49:12.467 --> 01:49:14.737
Paralyzed and petrified

01:49:14.738 --> 01:49:17.329
See my face, I don't even know me

01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:20.049
- My life is flashing by
- The end is near

01:49:20.050 --> 01:49:21.905
Dying's an easy thing

01:49:21.906 --> 01:49:24.273
Trying to crash and burn

01:49:24.274 --> 01:49:26.576
It's living that defeats the weak

01:49:26.577 --> 01:49:29.414
I'll finally get my turn

01:49:38.032 --> 01:49:42.447
Not gonna stake my life,
not gonna stake my life

01:49:42.448 --> 01:49:45.070
I've got better things to lose

01:49:45.071 --> 01:49:47.310
Not gonna stake my life, no

01:49:47.311 --> 01:49:51.502
Not gonna stake my life,
not gonna stake my life

01:49:51.503 --> 01:49:54.222
I've got better things to lose

01:49:54.223 --> 01:49:56.589
Not gonna stake my life, no

01:49:56.590 --> 01:50:00.653
Not gonna stake my life,
not gonna stake my life

01:50:00.654 --> 01:50:03.373
I've got better things to lose

01:50:03.374 --> 01:50:05.804
Not gonna stake my life, no

01:50:05.805 --> 01:50:09.804
Not gonna stake my life,
not gonna stake my life

01:50:09.805 --> 01:50:12.492
I've got better things to lose

01:50:12.493 --> 01:50:16.092
Not gonna stake my life, no

01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:44.936
- Not gonna stake my life
- No, I'm not

01:50:44.937 --> 01:50:46.919
Not gonna stake my life

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:49.095
I've got better things to lose

01:50:49.096 --> 01:50:52.264
- Not gonna stake my life
- Don't take my life

01:50:52.265 --> 01:50:54.343
- Not gonna stake my life
- Eternity

01:50:54.344 --> 01:50:56.487
Not gonna stake my life

01:50:56.488 --> 01:50:58.663
I've got better things to lose

01:50:58.664 --> 01:51:01.383
Not gonna take my life

01:51:01.384 --> 01:51:03.207
One pull of the trigger

01:51:03.208 --> 01:51:05.814
Can I do it or not?

01:51:07.078 --> 01:51:11.737
No, I'm not not not
gonna take my life

01:51:12.359 --> 01:51:14.501
No one's in the room

01:51:14.502 --> 01:51:17.061
I feel the pounding

01:51:17.062 --> 01:51:19.493
I feel surrounding

01:51:19.494 --> 01:51:21.541
Drowning, confounding

01:51:21.542 --> 01:51:23.877
Pounding, surrounding

01:51:23.878 --> 01:51:26.275
Not gonna, not gonna

01:51:26.276 --> 01:51:30.902
Not gonna take my life.
