00:46.080 --> 00:49.920
JULIET OF THE SPIRITS

02:33.120 --> 02:34.680
Shall I light the candles, signora?

02:34.800 --> 02:36.320
No, let her light them.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.840
Yes, I want to light them.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.240
You're putting on the red wig.
I like the blond one better.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.520
Teresina, I'll decide
what wig I want to wear.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.200
Pardon me, signora.
I just love blond hair.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.360
But that one looks good too.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.440
What shoes do you want
to wear?

02:52.560 --> 02:54.880
I've already got them on,
Teresina.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.400
I wanted to give you
a present.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.040
It doesn't matter.
Some other time.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.640
This one looks very nice.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.640
No, it doesn't! I look terrible.
I won't wear any at all.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.640
I never want to see
this dress again! Get rid of it!

03:09.720 --> 03:12.360
And this too!
You can have it.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.680
Has your husband said what he's giving
you for an anniversary present?

03:16.760 --> 03:19.480
Your gift for him is beautiful.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.600
Your husband's home.
Off the bed, you.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.080
Hurry, he's already in the garden.
Let me try it on.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.400
Quick, my dress!

03:38.720 --> 03:41.720
I feel so excited.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.440
How beautiful!

03:43.560 --> 03:45.400
Is everything ready?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.720
Light the candles.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.960
His gift is under his napkin.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.800
You've lost an earring!

03:55.880 --> 03:58.800
I left it in the bathroom.
Go get it, please.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.920
Turn off the lights.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.680
What's the matter?
Is the power out?

04:28.440 --> 04:31.440
Well, what's wrong?

04:33.640 --> 04:37.440
You're right, I'm sorry.
What an idiot I am!

04:37.560 --> 04:40.320
And I even wrote down
the date!

04:40.400 --> 04:43.640
But I have a surprise
for you too.

04:44.840 --> 04:47.640
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
It's our anniversary.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.920
Look who's here.

04:50.040 --> 04:54.800
Your anniversary?
Precious darling!

04:55.000 --> 04:58.520
Look what I brought you
from Los Angeles.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.560
It's a charm against spirits.

05:02.680 --> 05:03.800
Hang it up!

05:05.720 --> 05:07.880
It's been fifteen years, friends.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.680
That dog has been so nervous
lately. Truk-Truk!

05:12.920 --> 05:16.520
That's Genius, the greatest
clairvoyant on earth.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.320
Dear lady, I know all about you.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.000
Born under Aquarius, right?

05:21.280 --> 05:24.280
Many great personalities
in this sign.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.920
Always a pleasure to see you--

05:27.320 --> 05:29.200
Madame Pompadour also.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.480
Believe me, astrology's
a fascinating science.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.480
Giulietta, can you give us
something to eat?

05:36.720 --> 05:37.680
Anything--

05:37.800 --> 05:39.200
They've made up.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.920
I see red when this idiot
starts chattering.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.680
I'll cook. I'll make my famous
Pilaf Ã  la Dolores.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.960
- Do you have paprika?
- Red pepper. I'll help you.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.800
No!
Secret recipe.

05:53.880 --> 05:57.800
To sculpt, cook, make love--
I live for these.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.440
I'm Cesarino.
I've seen you at the Vigor Club.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.240
Never been there.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.400
I've done some weight lifting.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.720
Lift me up!

06:17.560 --> 06:19.280
What news does this handsome
gentleman have?

06:19.360 --> 06:21.720
You already know everything.
You see it in your cards.

06:21.800 --> 06:25.400
But you're so mysterious.
My cards can only go so far.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.480
What'll we do?

06:27.560 --> 06:29.040
Do we have to feed them all?

06:29.120 --> 06:30.640
Of course, they're guests.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.080
Where's signora Giulietta?

06:36.440 --> 06:39.200
Now, don't be stupid
and start crying.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.360
You're pretty as a doll.
I must speak to you.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.120
Not now, excuse me...

06:47.200 --> 06:50.680
Your sister's problems
are easily explained.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.120
The ancient Hindus and Egyptians
knew all about these things.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.400
Why don't you send your sister
to see me?

07:03.040 --> 07:04.440
Behave. Behave.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.200
Genius will try the pendulum.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.040
Empty out your mind.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.120
Things are looking very good.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.360
You have a great magnetic charge.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.680
This house is strange.
Who lived here?

07:23.120 --> 07:25.360
A positive reaction, you see.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.440
The pendulum moves
from left to right.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.640
Not now.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.520
What's going on?

07:34.240 --> 07:35.840
Talking behind my back?

07:36.280 --> 07:37.560
Are you angry?

07:39.240 --> 07:42.200
I'm sorry, darling,
for not warning you.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.720
They dropped by the office,
and there was nothing I could do.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.960
You did well.
They're all so very nice.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.520
Giorgio.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.160
Do you love me?

08:15.600 --> 08:18.920
Congratulations to you both!

08:19.960 --> 08:22.240
Long live the happy couple!

08:23.280 --> 08:24.640
Are you married?

08:24.720 --> 08:27.120
Would I say congratulations?

08:34.159 --> 08:36.559
It's much more heroic
to lie.

08:37.240 --> 08:38.760
I'll see that you get
a gold medal.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.480
Does your wife know
you're a hero?

08:43.840 --> 08:47.120
Sit straight,
don't cross your legs.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.400
I'll purify the air.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.480
No cats!
They attract unquiet spirits.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.640
You can shove your incense!

09:02.640 --> 09:05.160
You can go to bed now.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.960
She said she was through
with seances. I'm afraid.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.480
Well, go on.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.840
God, I sense so many spirits!

09:21.040 --> 09:23.240
They're all around us.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.440
Sorry, it's the incense.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.960
Concentrate.
Empty your minds.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.040
Yes, I feel a new presence.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.120
One who's never come before.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.600
Is the magnetism
strong enough, Maestro?

09:43.960 --> 09:46.600
Tell your spirit to fill
the gin bottle.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.840
O-o-o-ne.

09:54.240 --> 09:57.240
Hold your breath...
two-o-o.

09:57.320 --> 10:00.160
Take longer steps.
Ready, one.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.680
There it is!

10:05.560 --> 10:07.080
Question him, Maestro.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.400
Spirit, can you tell us
your name?

10:13.240 --> 10:15.080
It said, "l."

10:16.880 --> 10:18.680
"R."

10:21.040 --> 10:23.080
"H."
Didn't it say "H"?

10:23.160 --> 10:25.360
Shhh, it said "l".

10:25.600 --> 10:27.520
"S."
"Iris."

10:27.640 --> 10:29.400
It's a woman.

10:30.520 --> 10:33.840
A lovely name.
I wonder who she was.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.560
Who are you?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.600
Very beautiful.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.160
Right, Maestro?

10:44.560 --> 10:46.360
That's what she said.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.360
Do you have a message for us?

10:53.440 --> 10:55.640
She said, "Love for everybody."

10:55.760 --> 10:59.520
That's a charming message.
Listen, Iris--

11:01.960 --> 11:03.200
What was that?

11:03.320 --> 11:06.760
Interference.
Is it still you, Iris?

11:07.640 --> 11:09.560
It said no.
Let's find out.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.640
What's your name?

11:14.040 --> 11:17.280
"Olaf."
He says "Olaf."

11:19.000 --> 11:21.640
Ah, you're Turkish.
Isn't that right?

11:22.680 --> 11:24.760
He says he'll Turk you.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.920
Tell each of us something nice...

11:29.040 --> 11:31.520
that might make our lives
more bearable.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.120
For example, what can you tell
our friend Dolly?

11:35.680 --> 11:36.640
"Whore."

11:37.400 --> 11:39.280
No, dear, you don't understand.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.640
He said, "Big old hag."

11:45.440 --> 11:46.960
That's not an insult.

11:51.120 --> 11:55.560
Poor spirit.
Go in peace.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.320
Professor, send him away.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.640
Hello.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.880
Who is it?

12:07.280 --> 12:08.840
They hung up.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.120
Giulietta, a message for you!

12:12.200 --> 12:14.280
"Who do you think you are?

12:14.360 --> 12:16.840
You're nothing to anybody.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.000
Nobody needs you."

12:21.880 --> 12:24.160
Don't break the chain.
It's dangerous!

12:25.960 --> 12:28.360
- What's going on?
- Is someone ill?

12:28.440 --> 12:30.360
Turn on the lights!

12:30.480 --> 12:32.200
She'll come to by herself.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.880
She's receiving a message
from the other side.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.480
Go away, Olaf.

12:38.600 --> 12:42.440
Of course.
So long.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.920
I'm here, you silly.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.200
The maestro scares the ladies.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.160
This little lady is very gifted...

12:54.240 --> 12:57.520
very gifted indeed.

13:21.420 --> 13:23.140
Has my husband gone?

13:23.340 --> 13:25.500
Just now, signora.

13:25.620 --> 13:29.980
He didn't want to wake you.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.620
He said he won't be home
for dinner.

13:32.900 --> 13:36.460
Your nieces are on the beach
with their nurse.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.580
Good morning.

14:03.660 --> 14:07.540
I have to clean the pool.
All this stuff clogs the drain.

14:07.620 --> 14:09.140
Good idea, Gasperino.

14:10.020 --> 14:11.860
Beautiful day, isn't it?

14:30.540 --> 14:31.580
A fine thing.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.300
He's from my town.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.740
"For everybody."

14:45.620 --> 14:48.220
"Love for everybody."

15:00.060 --> 15:02.100
I'll bring breakfast right away.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.100
Is that you, Iris?

15:41.220 --> 15:45.140
Haven't you ever flown?
Or listened to shortwave?

15:45.220 --> 15:47.780
The air is full of voices
giving orders.

15:48.580 --> 15:52.780
Human voices with phlegm...
certainly not spirits.

15:52.860 --> 15:55.740
Your naivete offends
scientific thought.

15:55.860 --> 15:59.220
Certain electrical forces cause
bizarre reactions.

15:59.380 --> 16:02.900
Couldn't we be getting messages
from other planets?

16:04.780 --> 16:07.180
- But I saw in Readers' Digest--
- You shut up.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.540
Forget these experiments.

16:09.660 --> 16:12.980
As a child, I only had
to close my eyes.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.620
Me too.
I'd close my eyes.

16:15.740 --> 16:19.140
I'd see big, beautiful
colored balls.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.340
I'd see castles, dark forests,
streets...

16:22.500 --> 16:24.140
faces no bigger than that...

16:24.220 --> 16:26.660
with little sparkling eyes.

16:27.260 --> 16:30.500
They all scared me,
but it was wonderful.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.900
This went on for years.

16:35.980 --> 16:38.060
Then it stopped.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.420
But I only had to close my eyes.

16:50.860 --> 16:54.340
Possibly the result
of faulty digestion.

16:54.460 --> 16:57.180
When we die, all that's left
is a pile of dust, maybe a bone...

16:57.260 --> 16:58.900
in which case,
watch out for the cat!

16:58.980 --> 17:02.860
You should take long swims,
buy a horse, go riding.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.660
But, above all,
tell your husband...

17:05.740 --> 17:07.579
to make love more often.

17:08.819 --> 17:12.540
That's the best remedy
against spirits and toothaches.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.780
I know, Doctor.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.460
This really is an apparition.

17:43.580 --> 17:46.620
Even I can believe in this one.

17:48.060 --> 17:49.860
I'd welcome it day and night!

17:50.500 --> 17:52.580
Our next-door neighbor.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.100
We don't frequent her.

18:08.580 --> 18:12.460
You may not frequent her,
but I'd love to.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.740
Mademoiselle, get the children,
please.

18:46.380 --> 18:48.340
I'm going swimming.

18:54.500 --> 18:58.780
Our sweet Giulietta always
sees magic everywhere.

19:43.180 --> 19:45.620
Help me, please.

19:46.020 --> 19:47.780
I'm old.

19:50.180 --> 19:52.980
Besides, this involves you.

20:27.340 --> 20:28.260
Doctor.

20:33.260 --> 20:35.700
Doctor, help me.

21:13.380 --> 21:16.380
The lady over there sent us
this nice fruit.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.140
Wasn't that nice?

22:05.740 --> 22:07.980
No, I didn't say anything.

22:10.260 --> 22:12.420
Don't run. Come here.

22:13.620 --> 22:16.100
Mama, this morning on the beach
we saw a fish without its head.

22:16.220 --> 22:20.340
Aunt Giulietta said it would grow back
if we threw it back in.

22:20.580 --> 22:21.820
Did you go swimming?

22:22.380 --> 22:26.260
Aunt Sylva! We saw a fish
without its head.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.940
Don't touch.
Your hands are dirty.

22:31.140 --> 22:33.100
I wish I could have a little
house at the seaside too.

22:33.220 --> 22:34.940
You're pale!

22:36.900 --> 22:38.620
The little one's
completely white.

22:38.700 --> 22:40.580
Didn't you take her out
in the sun?

22:40.700 --> 22:43.020
Don't you remember
what the doctor said?

22:43.100 --> 22:45.980
At least two hours a day.

22:54.780 --> 22:57.820
Sylva, what a nice surprise.

22:57.940 --> 23:00.340
I came with Adele and Mama
for the children.

23:01.740 --> 23:02.660
Mama.

23:02.780 --> 23:05.500
You're running around
in this heat?

23:05.700 --> 23:08.340
We're just going inside now.

23:08.460 --> 23:09.740
You're perspiring.

23:09.820 --> 23:10.940
Will you have lunch with me?

23:11.060 --> 23:13.660
I can't. I have a TV rehearsal
at 3:00.

23:13.780 --> 23:17.660
It's already 2:00.
When are we due at Luciana's?

23:17.940 --> 23:20.340
At 4:00. Then we go
to the dressmaker's.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.460
The children were fun.
They love it here with me.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.460
You look wonderful.

23:27.060 --> 23:30.020
I lost four pounds
for my director.

23:30.140 --> 23:31.500
Do you go out at night?

23:31.580 --> 23:33.980
Nothing much to do here.

23:34.100 --> 23:37.460
Usually I'm tired
so we just stay home.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.420
By the way, your husband
has some nerve.

23:39.500 --> 23:44.660
He wanted me to go out with him
and some Venezuelan.

23:44.740 --> 23:45.660
So I told him...

23:45.780 --> 23:47.940
"Lovely, I'll bring
my boyfriend."

23:48.060 --> 23:51.100
And he says, "No, it doesn't matter,
some other time."

23:51.220 --> 23:52.380
What gives?

23:52.500 --> 23:55.100
Isn't your husband ever home?

23:55.220 --> 23:57.580
Every evening after work.

23:57.700 --> 24:00.260
He works hard.
Isn't he exhausted?

24:00.380 --> 24:02.900
We're thinking
of a long vacation.

24:03.020 --> 24:05.700
Maybe we'll take a cruise,
just the two of us.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.620
Maybe Spain or Greece.

24:07.740 --> 24:09.460
I have all the pamphlets.

24:09.900 --> 24:11.580
This time, we're really going.

24:37.220 --> 24:40.740
Don't forget to watch TV
on Saturday.

24:40.860 --> 24:43.100
Your little sister has
a perfectly marvelous part.

24:45.420 --> 24:46.900
Till Sunday.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.300
Bye, Mama.
What's the matter?

24:50.380 --> 24:52.220
Nothing, just looking.

24:52.300 --> 24:55.900
You should wear makeup.
At least some lipstick.

24:56.820 --> 24:59.460
You're right, but...
we were at the beach.

24:59.620 --> 25:01.420
Take better care of yourself.

25:22.340 --> 25:25.180
"Move the eyes horizontally
for ten minutes."

25:25.260 --> 25:28.300
Look, signora.
Look how Elisabetta does it!

25:29.260 --> 25:32.900
Not your head, just your eyes.
Wait.

25:33.780 --> 25:35.140
Like this.

25:38.020 --> 25:40.220
Getting faster and faster.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.620
Fifteen days
of these eye exercises...

25:42.700 --> 25:47.060
will restore your eyes
to the brilliance of two jewels.

25:48.060 --> 25:49.340
Good evening.

25:51.580 --> 25:53.340
Bring the tray in here.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.260
No, dear, I'm not hungry.

25:56.260 --> 25:59.620
What a day I had.
What's on TV?

25:59.740 --> 26:01.100
Want some pie?

26:01.180 --> 26:04.060
No, I had a snack at the office.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.100
Sit down here.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.020
Are you tired?

26:13.100 --> 26:14.700
A little.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.260
Try to pronounce
the following words.

26:18.900 --> 26:20.980
Teresina, from now on
you have to speak like that.

26:21.060 --> 26:26.300
Constantinople, consequential,
essential, success...

26:26.580 --> 26:28.900
The constant repetition
of this exercise...

26:29.020 --> 26:31.580
has brought success to some
of our most popular actresses.

26:31.660 --> 26:34.140
You know, I was on the beach
today.

26:35.660 --> 26:36.700
And?

26:36.780 --> 26:39.940
Nothing. I told the doctor
about last night. He teased me.

26:40.060 --> 26:43.740
Then at a certain point, l--

26:45.460 --> 26:47.140
What?

26:47.580 --> 26:50.100
Nothing.
It's not important.

26:50.860 --> 26:53.540
Ladies and gentlemen,
good night.

26:58.460 --> 27:01.460
Tomorrow I have
another hard day.

27:01.820 --> 27:04.460
Call me at 7:00.
Have the car ready for 7:30.

27:31.100 --> 27:33.460
Gabriella.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.140
What did you say, dear?

27:51.900 --> 27:53.340
Who is Gabriella?

27:55.700 --> 27:57.380
Tell me, who is Gabriella?

28:16.060 --> 28:18.100
Good morning, dear.
Did you sleep well?

28:18.500 --> 28:21.140
Don't start smoking first thing.

28:21.460 --> 28:24.820
Tonight I have those Brazilians.

28:24.900 --> 28:26.780
They're important clients.
What are you doing?

28:27.620 --> 28:29.740
You said to stop smoking.
I put the cigarette out.

28:33.900 --> 28:35.780
You look marvelous.

28:35.900 --> 28:38.340
My back, on the other hand,
is killing me.

28:38.460 --> 28:40.220
Who is Gabriella?

28:45.700 --> 28:47.100
I don't understand.
Who is Gabriella?

28:47.220 --> 28:50.620
In your sleep you said
"Gabriella" twice.

28:55.100 --> 28:58.780
Ah, there's my book.
I looked everywhere for it.

28:58.860 --> 29:01.500
You must have been dreaming.

29:02.220 --> 29:05.180
Who is she?
Do I happen to know her?

29:05.540 --> 29:08.140
What are you talking about?
I don't know any Gabriella.

29:08.220 --> 29:09.940
You must have misunderstood.

29:10.620 --> 29:13.620
I'll try not to be late.
Anyway, I'll call you.

29:14.260 --> 29:16.060
Going swimming?

29:33.260 --> 29:36.180
Hello. Hello!

29:36.260 --> 29:38.380
Oh, go to hell!

29:39.060 --> 29:42.060
I'm sorry, but it happens
three or four times a day.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.300
I answer, they hang up.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.860
Nothing.

30:00.340 --> 30:04.020
So when he comes back
from Venezuela, repentant...

30:04.100 --> 30:06.580
she says, "Some nerve you've got."

30:06.660 --> 30:08.260
Gabriella.

30:08.380 --> 30:10.860
I heard it right.
He said "Gabriella."

30:11.780 --> 30:15.100
But he seemed so sincere
when he denied it.

30:15.660 --> 30:17.420
He likes the ladies, it's true.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.300
Am I right, signora?

30:19.420 --> 30:21.740
You have to be understanding.

30:21.860 --> 30:24.380
You can't force others
to do what you want.

30:24.500 --> 30:27.300
Not me!
I believe what they tell me.

30:27.420 --> 30:31.900
If they say yes,
it's yes, not "no" or "but."

30:32.020 --> 30:33.500
Isn't that right, signora?

30:33.620 --> 30:35.260
You can't be domineering.

30:36.580 --> 30:38.740
But he said to me once...

30:39.420 --> 30:41.940
"I'll never lie to you."

30:42.340 --> 30:43.260
"Never."

30:45.540 --> 30:50.940
By daylight
your house is a dream.

30:51.580 --> 30:54.340
Ciao, Val! Watch the dog.
We're full of cats here.

30:54.460 --> 30:56.700
Enchanting!

30:58.500 --> 31:01.860
This perfume makes me drunk.

31:03.140 --> 31:06.460
Look at the dew!
That is dew, isn't it?

31:06.900 --> 31:08.820
How divinely pure!

31:09.220 --> 31:12.060
It pains the heart,
it's so beautiful.

31:12.460 --> 31:14.420
I'd like to roll naked in it.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.380
Why don't you?

31:16.500 --> 31:20.820
We've all become
too complicated, uncivilized.

31:23.300 --> 31:26.780
What are you doing ?
It's sopping wet here.

31:26.860 --> 31:29.700
Aren't you afraid
of rheumatism?

31:31.660 --> 31:33.420
Sit here, Valentina.

31:33.540 --> 31:35.300
Teresina, move the peppers.

31:38.300 --> 31:40.060
What are you doing?

31:40.180 --> 31:42.180
We're stringing peppers
for the winter.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.060
In garlands?

31:45.260 --> 31:47.380
A wreath of peppers!

31:48.100 --> 31:50.820
What a wonderful housewife
you are!

31:51.980 --> 31:54.700
I'm the opposite, on the other hand.
It's shameful.

31:54.820 --> 31:57.180
Why am I like that?

31:57.300 --> 32:00.180
I feel uprooted and adrift.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.300
Peppers, they're really nothing...

32:02.420 --> 32:05.300
but if I could string them,
perhaps I'd be saved.

32:05.420 --> 32:07.580
Come, Teresina.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.780
Nobody's thought about lunch.

32:11.860 --> 32:13.300
Can you stay?

32:13.420 --> 32:16.220
Wake up, Teresina.
It's almost noon.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.100
What?

32:18.260 --> 32:21.380
I was supposed to meet
Raniero at 11:00!

32:22.420 --> 32:26.140
We have such fights if I'm late.

32:26.220 --> 32:27.420
Bye, precious!

32:27.500 --> 32:29.260
I'll see you at 5:00.

32:29.340 --> 32:30.820
Where will you see me
at 5:00?

32:30.940 --> 32:34.460
Didn't I tell you?
That's why I came.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.540
You've got to come with us
this afternoon.

32:37.700 --> 32:39.340
Don't say no.
You can't miss it.

32:39.420 --> 32:40.380
But where?

32:40.460 --> 32:44.140
Bishma!
At 5:00 at the Plaza.

32:44.460 --> 32:47.980
For only two days. He comes
to Europe once every seven years.

32:48.060 --> 32:51.700
He's hugely popular in America
in clubs, schools.

32:51.780 --> 32:53.220
It's the chance of a lifetime.

32:53.300 --> 32:54.500
Hold still.

32:54.620 --> 32:57.100
The chance of a lifetime.
Do you know his experiments?

32:57.220 --> 32:58.460
I've never heard of them.

32:58.580 --> 33:01.620
Giulietta, what world
are you living in?

33:02.140 --> 33:05.060
He's a fabulous clairvoyant.

33:05.260 --> 33:08.900
A man-woman who holds
the secret of both sexes.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.700
He's an oracle.
He'll enlighten you.

33:11.780 --> 33:13.900
He could change your life.

33:14.020 --> 33:16.820
- Is he a Hindu?
- Hindu, Chinese, what does it matter?

33:16.900 --> 33:18.660
Bishma belongs to the world.

33:20.660 --> 33:23.620
Some meetings are predestined.

33:23.740 --> 33:25.540
Maybe he's here for you.

33:25.660 --> 33:29.220
I can't go. Suppose Giorgio phones
and I'm out?

33:29.340 --> 33:32.660
- You'll be sorry.
- Don't expect me.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.180
There's a power outage.

33:39.420 --> 33:42.620
- Where is Bishma's apartment?
- The meeting is on the terrace.

33:43.420 --> 33:45.620
Show these ladies upstairs.

33:50.420 --> 33:52.580
We have to take the stairs.
The elevator is stuck.

33:52.700 --> 33:56.180
- Let's go back, Valentina.
- Has he already started?

33:56.260 --> 33:58.220
I don't know, signora.

33:59.420 --> 34:01.500
Come on. Did you prepare
your questions?

34:01.620 --> 34:05.180
What questions?
I've nothing to ask.

34:05.700 --> 34:07.460
When I was a girl,
Papa used to tell me...

34:07.580 --> 34:09.340
this hotel was for--

34:14.780 --> 34:17.460
At last! Did you get lost
in the dark?

34:19.940 --> 34:21.500
He foretold everything.

34:22.219 --> 34:25.820
That night I dreamed of His Excellency,
but without his uniform.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.460
What could it mean?

34:36.340 --> 34:40.380
Cherish your wife
as part of yourself.

34:40.460 --> 34:43.580
He who loves his wife
loves himself.

34:44.219 --> 34:45.340
Love one another...

34:45.460 --> 34:48.260
for better, for worse...

34:48.380 --> 34:50.659
for richer, for poorer...

34:50.780 --> 34:52.620
in sickness and in health.

34:53.060 --> 34:55.260
What are you looking at?

34:55.340 --> 34:57.380
There's a wedding party.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.100
How delightful.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.860
That's the second step...

35:05.980 --> 35:08.420
but it's still not true illumination.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.420
So, what is this?

35:10.540 --> 35:14.300
The Single Spirit.
That fruit is only appearance.

35:14.420 --> 35:17.940
But the real Buddha
is beyond such differences.

35:18.020 --> 35:18.940
Right?

35:19.060 --> 35:20.940
That's the third step.

35:21.700 --> 35:25.780
At this point the truth
is both far and near.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.140
So, then, what is this?

35:30.260 --> 35:31.780
Isn't it an apple?

35:31.900 --> 35:33.980
No, dear, you don't understand.

35:34.060 --> 35:35.940
You have to see
beyond material form.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.700
The Master himself will tell you.

35:42.900 --> 35:44.540
It's an apple...

35:44.620 --> 35:48.340
just a humble little apple...

35:48.420 --> 35:50.340
small and red...

35:50.460 --> 35:53.020
and bruised on one side...

35:53.100 --> 35:56.700
but at the same time
it's the Buddha...

35:56.780 --> 35:59.500
and the Single Spirit.

35:59.660 --> 36:02.660
Things return to being things...

36:02.780 --> 36:06.020
but the Enlightened
sees at the same time...

36:06.140 --> 36:09.180
Oneness and Manyness...

36:09.300 --> 36:13.100
appearance as well as substance.

36:14.060 --> 36:17.700
- Do heaven and hell exist?
- Who are you?

36:17.820 --> 36:19.740
A painter.
An American painter.

36:19.860 --> 36:21.420
Let me see.

36:22.620 --> 36:24.500
Cut off my head!

36:30.100 --> 36:31.580
Come on,
cut her head off!

36:31.700 --> 36:35.140
It's one of Lao-Tse's fables.

36:36.100 --> 36:37.020
Go on!

36:38.500 --> 36:40.940
Behold, the gates of hell
are opening.

36:42.260 --> 36:45.260
And now, the gates of paradise.

36:57.060 --> 36:58.620
What's the matter?

36:58.780 --> 37:00.820
Don't disturb him.

37:03.940 --> 37:06.780
He's in communication
with his god.

37:34.180 --> 37:38.220
The lady called Giulietta
may enter now...

37:38.580 --> 37:40.900
but only she.

37:45.860 --> 37:47.380
Please.

37:55.460 --> 37:56.420
How is he?

37:56.500 --> 37:58.580
He wants to see me alone.
Go away!

37:58.740 --> 38:01.380
- But I brought you!
- Fine, but he wants to talk to me!

38:01.500 --> 38:02.700
Where is he?

38:03.460 --> 38:06.300
I don't know. In the bathroom,
maybe. Wait outside.

38:06.380 --> 38:08.540
We have an appointment--

38:25.580 --> 38:28.580
Giulietta, do you know
the Kama Sutra?

38:28.700 --> 38:32.220
The sexual act is a conflict.

38:32.420 --> 38:36.540
To be happy you must behave
as if in battle.

38:37.380 --> 38:40.740
The battleground of passion
is your body...

38:41.900 --> 38:45.380
and of the body, the shoulders...

38:45.660 --> 38:47.580
and the place between the breasts.

38:51.860 --> 38:54.540
The sounds to emit in love...

38:54.660 --> 38:57.620
that procure pleasure:
the sound hin.

38:58.780 --> 39:00.740
The great sigh.

39:02.460 --> 39:04.460
The sound put.

39:05.420 --> 39:07.260
The sound fut.

39:08.460 --> 39:10.740
The sound plat.

39:10.900 --> 39:13.500
We can add sounds...

39:13.620 --> 39:16.460
Like those made by pigeons...

39:24.540 --> 39:26.900
and green sparrows...

39:27.020 --> 39:29.220
and flamingoes...

39:29.780 --> 39:31.740
and quails...

39:32.180 --> 39:34.580
and storks.

39:37.060 --> 39:39.820
Sounds that can be employed...

39:39.940 --> 39:42.860
according to the occasion.

39:42.980 --> 39:46.260
Different kinds of bites are...

39:46.380 --> 39:48.020
the dark bite...

39:48.100 --> 39:50.580
the swollen bite...

39:51.060 --> 39:53.180
the point...

39:53.460 --> 39:55.740
the line of the point...

39:55.820 --> 39:57.420
coral and jewel...

39:58.220 --> 40:00.700
the torn cloud...

40:01.180 --> 40:03.900
the wolf bite.

40:06.820 --> 40:10.100
Love is a religion, Giulietta.

40:10.780 --> 40:13.300
Your husband is your god...

40:13.900 --> 40:17.340
and you are priestess
of his cult.

40:17.500 --> 40:20.420
Your spirit, like this incense...

40:20.780 --> 40:24.020
must glow and smoke...

40:24.260 --> 40:28.260
on the altar of your body in love.

40:31.460 --> 40:33.620
If you have any questions...

40:33.820 --> 40:35.820
the master will answer.

40:39.980 --> 40:42.620
No, nothing really...

40:43.420 --> 40:45.140
only--

40:51.220 --> 40:54.180
Since last night,
I feel I've lost everything.

40:55.860 --> 40:59.260
I'm afraid my husband has
another woman.

41:01.940 --> 41:06.620
Why don't you learn to please
your husband more, Giulietta?

41:07.140 --> 41:08.700
I do please him.

41:10.180 --> 41:12.540
Remember me?

41:12.660 --> 41:16.500
I was born like this,
a woman of passion.

41:16.860 --> 41:18.900
Am I beautiful?

41:18.980 --> 41:22.820
Speak frankly.
Am I beautiful?

41:24.740 --> 41:26.180
Very.

41:26.300 --> 41:30.300
I think so too.
You've seen my hair?

41:31.780 --> 41:34.420
I never comb it.
I caress it.

41:34.500 --> 41:36.980
I love to caress myself.

41:37.300 --> 41:39.940
I have the whitest skin.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.540
If I'm in a bad mood...

41:43.660 --> 41:45.620
I go to the mirror.

41:45.700 --> 41:49.940
I turn around, I study my back,
and I'm happy again.

41:50.020 --> 41:52.420
Did you buy those stockings?

41:52.540 --> 41:53.940
No, what stockings?

41:56.140 --> 41:58.820
The black net stockings.

41:59.500 --> 42:02.500
Woman all want to be sirens...

42:02.620 --> 42:04.260
but don't know their trade.

42:04.380 --> 42:08.020
- Love is a trade?
- I didn't say trade. I said art.

42:08.100 --> 42:10.500
I heard you very well.
You said trade.

42:10.660 --> 42:13.380
That of a prostitute?
Good advice!

42:25.340 --> 42:26.260
Who is it?

42:26.380 --> 42:29.460
Olaf, go away!
Iris! Nabur!

42:31.020 --> 42:33.460
Grow beautiful like me!
Like me!

42:34.060 --> 42:35.900
Refined femininity.

42:36.020 --> 42:37.860
You're beautiful, Giulietta.
I want to kiss you.

42:48.780 --> 42:50.460
Enough!

42:57.500 --> 43:00.180
I want to go.
Help me.

43:06.580 --> 43:08.580
- Calm down.
- I want to go.

43:10.340 --> 43:13.660
It's not advisable to invoke
our mysterious inner forces...

43:13.740 --> 43:15.980
without proper preparation.

43:16.060 --> 43:18.260
It can be very dangerous.

43:18.340 --> 43:21.820
But these spirits are generous
and kind...

43:22.060 --> 43:25.860
even if they sometimes
play tricks.

43:34.580 --> 43:37.620
Good-bye, signora.
Did you receive good advice?

43:37.700 --> 43:39.740
- Yes, thank you.
- You're pleased?

43:40.420 --> 43:42.580
Good-bye.

43:43.140 --> 43:45.020
Good luck!

43:49.820 --> 43:52.060
What did he say? What did you see?
Out here we heard--

43:53.700 --> 43:55.580
There's another message.

43:55.660 --> 43:58.620
Something new will happen
this evening.

43:58.700 --> 44:01.500
Something new and beautiful.

44:01.580 --> 44:03.620
SangrÃ­a.

44:03.740 --> 44:07.580
It quenches every thirst
in those who drink it...

44:07.700 --> 44:12.460
even that thirst
which is never confessed.

44:12.940 --> 44:16.340
They call it
the drink of oblivion.

44:18.500 --> 44:20.180
Strange.

44:20.300 --> 44:22.380
That's not his voice.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.820
It's a spirit speaking.

44:24.900 --> 44:27.740
Did you hear?
Something extraordinary.

44:27.940 --> 44:30.580
He said she'll have an extraordinary
encounter this evening.

44:30.700 --> 44:32.100
Aren't you pleased?

44:36.460 --> 44:39.060
- Did you see her yourself?
- I thought so.

44:39.140 --> 44:42.500
- Did she say, "l am Iris?"
- No, but I felt it was her.

44:42.620 --> 44:45.340
I felt the same sensation
as the other night.

44:45.460 --> 44:46.780
That's strange.

44:47.580 --> 44:49.820
Who could she be?

44:51.380 --> 44:54.220
Perhaps Grandpa's
bareback rider.

44:56.300 --> 45:00.540
My grandfather was a professor, and
he fell in love with a beautiful dancer.

46:18.620 --> 46:21.820
What a pretty little girl!
What's your name?

46:22.580 --> 46:24.980
Tell her your name.

46:25.500 --> 46:28.500
Did you see how brave
this young lady is?

46:28.740 --> 46:32.700
Your number was wonderful.
My most heartfelt compliments.

46:37.500 --> 46:40.020
A beautiful woman makes me feel
more religious.

47:16.940 --> 47:18.380
Who knows why?
I always imagined...

47:18.460 --> 47:23.260
they ran off
in that funny circus plane.

47:36.700 --> 47:39.060
Professor De Filippis,
in God's name!

47:39.940 --> 47:42.460
I order you to come down
immediately.

47:43.060 --> 47:44.500
I'm your principal.

47:44.620 --> 47:46.100
You'll answer to me...

47:46.220 --> 47:48.580
for your unpardonable conduct!

47:53.340 --> 47:56.700
The principal had him kicked out
of every school in the kingdom.

47:57.100 --> 47:58.500
He vanished.

47:58.620 --> 48:01.300
After two years, he came back,
cheerful as ever.

48:01.540 --> 48:03.580
Mama didn't want him
in the house.

48:03.660 --> 48:06.820
I saw him secretly at Christmas.

48:06.940 --> 48:10.420
Such stories he told!
He frightened me a little.

48:10.540 --> 48:13.180
The bishop said he was in league
with Satan.

48:14.180 --> 48:17.020
I was still little
when they took me to his funeral.

48:17.100 --> 48:18.620
Mama didn't cry.

48:18.740 --> 48:21.340
She wore a beautiful black dress.

48:21.460 --> 48:23.220
What a stupendous woman
your mother is!

48:23.340 --> 48:24.860
Yes, my mother's very beautiful.

48:25.220 --> 48:29.100
One night I got out of bed and saw her.
She was like a queen.

48:29.180 --> 48:30.940
Perhaps she was going to a ball
with Papa.

49:05.300 --> 49:07.140
Rosa aurata.

49:08.060 --> 49:10.340
A name like a line of poetry.

49:10.660 --> 49:12.260
I grew it once.

49:12.940 --> 49:15.420
My garden in Cordova
was famous.

49:16.020 --> 49:18.100
You're very fortunate.

49:18.500 --> 49:21.020
Flowers thank those
who care for them.

49:29.700 --> 49:32.780
One can see these plants
are showered with love.

49:33.380 --> 49:36.060
To give so much every day...

49:36.180 --> 49:38.100
you must be full of love.

49:40.340 --> 49:42.260
Is this all right, signore?

49:43.420 --> 49:45.460
Is this what you wanted?

49:45.540 --> 49:47.140
Yes, thank you.

49:47.260 --> 49:49.500
Three slices of lemon...

49:49.580 --> 49:51.340
three of orange...

49:52.420 --> 49:54.220
sparkling water.

49:58.660 --> 50:00.060
Now, a glass.

50:00.180 --> 50:01.660
Here, signore.

50:02.500 --> 50:05.180
Not a champagne glass.
An ordinary one.

50:05.300 --> 50:07.620
Teresina, get a big glass.

50:12.260 --> 50:14.660
Three spoonfuls of sugar.

50:21.020 --> 50:22.740
Shall I give him this one,
signora?

50:23.420 --> 50:26.020
- Will this do?
- Thank you.

50:26.980 --> 50:29.620
In Valencia, they add cloves...

50:29.980 --> 50:32.140
but in Cordova, we prefer
a more delicate flavor.

50:41.180 --> 50:44.180
Please, try it and tell me
how you like it.

50:48.860 --> 50:50.860
Lovely.
What's it called?

50:50.980 --> 50:52.380
SangrÃ­a.

50:52.940 --> 50:54.940
They say it quenches every thirst
in those who drink it...

50:56.220 --> 50:58.940
even that thirst
which is never confessed.

50:59.340 --> 51:01.900
In fact, they call it
the drink of oblivion.

51:02.380 --> 51:04.020
You'll have to stay with us
at least a week.

51:04.620 --> 51:06.020
You've introduced yourselves?

51:06.140 --> 51:09.980
I've often spoken of JosÃ©. Do you
remember? I was his guest in Spain.

51:10.100 --> 51:13.140
- When?
- Last year, in Castile.

51:14.300 --> 51:16.660
A wonderful palace.
What paintings!

51:16.780 --> 51:19.380
He has two Goyas...
or were they Velasquez?

51:19.580 --> 51:21.060
Neither. Riveras.

51:21.700 --> 51:23.180
Marvelous!

51:23.300 --> 51:24.780
Imagine, he wanted
to go to a hotel.

51:25.220 --> 51:28.940
Where could you find such peace
and quiet as we have here?

51:43.700 --> 51:47.260
What counts are
smooth movements.

51:48.180 --> 51:49.860
Balance.

51:51.140 --> 51:53.580
A good bullfighter must have
a pure heart...

51:54.020 --> 51:56.900
and clear thoughts,
like monks or dancers.

51:57.500 --> 51:59.820
He raises some of the best bulls
in Spain...

51:59.900 --> 52:02.060
and at night, this fool
lights up his garden...

52:02.140 --> 52:04.100
for solo bullfights!

52:04.420 --> 52:07.860
What courage!
But isn't it dangerous?

52:08.100 --> 52:10.580
No, signora. It's all a question
of style and poetry...

52:10.660 --> 52:12.620
and poetry is never dangerous.

52:13.340 --> 52:15.420
My best friends are bullfighters.

52:15.500 --> 52:18.060
They compose music
and write poetry.

52:19.100 --> 52:21.060
They hate to see blood.

52:22.300 --> 52:26.940
The style of bullfighting in Cordova
has an unimaginable harmony.

52:27.580 --> 52:29.660
- May l?
- Please.

52:31.260 --> 52:33.180
Wait a moment.

52:33.980 --> 52:36.300
I might have something better.

52:42.460 --> 52:44.500
Will this do for a cape?

52:47.300 --> 52:49.220
There's the bull...

52:49.740 --> 52:52.060
dying in his own illusion.

52:54.220 --> 52:56.420
It's not the sword
that kills him...

52:56.940 --> 52:59.540
but our magic in evading him.

53:00.220 --> 53:05.020
I send him to the void
with illusionary blows.

53:14.740 --> 53:18.140
One false step,
like a bad rhyme in poetry...

53:18.260 --> 53:20.580
and then there is
mortal danger.

53:20.700 --> 53:22.260
Please, signora.

53:23.620 --> 53:26.940
A spontaneity
born of calculation.

53:28.460 --> 53:31.460
A pure heart, clear thoughts...

53:31.580 --> 53:34.340
movements exact to the inch.

53:34.460 --> 53:36.220
Thus the monster is defeated.

53:45.860 --> 53:48.340
You didn't see what JosÃ©
brought me from Spain.

53:48.420 --> 53:50.900
I'll get it. It's magnificent.

54:04.020 --> 54:06.620
Surely you admire
GarcÃ­a Lorca?

54:08.860 --> 54:11.100
Destiny plays odd tricks.

54:11.620 --> 54:14.660
I was in Madrid,
hesitant to leave.

54:16.100 --> 54:18.740
I had a foreboding.

54:18.820 --> 54:22.300
Now that I'm here, I'm happy.

54:22.420 --> 54:26.620
What's left in life, if you take away
the harmony of such an evening?

54:27.060 --> 54:30.660
I'm indebted to you for such happiness.
I hope it continues.

54:30.780 --> 54:32.740
For so little?

54:32.860 --> 54:34.740
It can be everything.

54:34.900 --> 54:38.300
Yes, a sudden decision...

54:38.420 --> 54:41.180
meeting an old friend
who lives by the sea...

54:41.420 --> 54:43.740
a lost calm found again.

54:44.500 --> 54:48.180
Everything becomes clear
and plausible.

54:59.300 --> 55:01.740
Giulietta, what is it?
Come here.

55:02.100 --> 55:03.940
Isn't it a wonderful gift?

55:08.260 --> 55:09.780
A magic telescope.

55:11.380 --> 55:14.220
Last year there was
a terrible mess at their villa.

55:15.100 --> 55:17.460
They give parties,
which she organizes.

55:17.580 --> 55:20.140
The police became involved,
and they wanted to deport her.

55:20.460 --> 55:24.820
- I've heard fascinating stories.
- It's true, she's a beautiful woman.

55:44.060 --> 55:47.580
You're going to go to sleep already?
I wanted to talk to you.

55:48.100 --> 55:49.500
Did you say something?

55:49.580 --> 55:51.740
It doesn't matter.

56:06.620 --> 56:09.940
- Good night, dear.
- Good night. I'm going to read a while.

57:02.860 --> 57:04.660
I had them change the color
of the seats.

57:04.740 --> 57:07.140
That red color reminded me
of a cardinal.

57:07.260 --> 57:10.380
So now it's black,
with tobacco-colored seats.

57:10.740 --> 57:11.940
Do you like that?

57:12.380 --> 57:15.860
I told the guys, "It's for the most
beautiful woman in the world."

57:18.940 --> 57:20.940
I really didn't wake you?

57:21.540 --> 57:23.100
What were you doing?

57:24.380 --> 57:26.940
Of me?
What were you thinking?

57:30.180 --> 57:32.740
Good night, you little monster.
Till tomorrow.

57:32.860 --> 57:35.300
I'll wake you up. Bye.

57:39.100 --> 57:42.060
I forgot to ring
the wake-up service.

57:42.260 --> 57:44.700
It's a good thing
I remembered in time.

57:45.260 --> 57:47.060
Who did you call?

57:47.260 --> 57:50.460
I told you, I requested
a wake-up call.

57:52.900 --> 57:55.780
You want some? Come on.
Let's go to bed.

57:56.180 --> 57:58.060
Who were you calling?

57:58.820 --> 58:00.980
What's wrong with you?
Come on.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.120
What is it?

58:35.240 --> 58:37.320
Let's come back some other time...

58:37.400 --> 58:39.160
or you go alone.

58:39.280 --> 58:42.440
I don't behave that way.
We have an appointment.

58:43.520 --> 58:47.000
- But treating him like a thief--
- But he is a thief.

58:47.720 --> 58:49.760
Hasn't he stolen your youth,
your peace of mind, your trust?

58:49.880 --> 58:51.280
He's the worst of thieves!

58:52.000 --> 58:53.840
But setting a spy on him...

58:53.920 --> 58:55.800
who listens to everything,
sees everything.

58:55.920 --> 58:57.640
It would be like
living with a third person.

58:58.960 --> 59:01.320
Isn't there a third person
already?

59:03.240 --> 59:04.680
Trust them.

59:04.760 --> 59:08.080
Put yourself in their hands,
like going to confession.

59:08.160 --> 59:11.160
They'll see to everything.

59:27.160 --> 59:29.680
Hello. Follow me.

59:30.240 --> 59:33.040
Excuse my unexpected attire.

59:33.280 --> 59:37.680
Professional demands require
certain transformations.

59:38.080 --> 59:42.000
We serve anybody
who needs to know, to find out.

59:42.120 --> 59:43.760
But I ask you...

59:43.840 --> 59:46.400
are you sure
you won't be sorry later?

59:46.480 --> 59:49.400
Think, before it's too late.

59:49.680 --> 59:54.440
In these cases,
I recommend a little trip...

59:54.560 --> 59:56.400
a second honeymoon.

59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.600
Think ahead to the joy of a marriage
still alive in your old age...

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.200
of the sweetness of two white heads
on the same pillow.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.080
In time, suspicions melt away.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.640
Tomorrow you'll laugh
at what upsets you now.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.520
I don't think one can laugh
at one's own suffering.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.680
Anyway, my sister must know
the truth.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.320
So right.
I'm at your disposal.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.840
What does this gentleman do?

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.200
He organizes parties, rallies--

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.200
What does he do?
I've never really figured it out.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.880
- Perhaps public relations?
- Exactly.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.880
He arranges receptions...

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.600
premieres, fashion show openings.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.040
Do you have a picture of him?
I'll show it to our psychologist.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.120
Now I have
a very delicate question.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.520
Rest assured, nothing said here
will go beyond this office.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.280
For example, when he looks at you--
Excuse me.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.520
Would you please take off
your glasses?

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.120
- My glasses?
- Yes.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.400
Thank you. Does he blush
when you look straight in his eyes?

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.240
Does he always have
an alibi ready?

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.840
No, I don't think so.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.360
Have you ever caught him speaking
a foreign language on the phone?

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.320
Caught him? He speaks
foreign languages with certain clients.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.000
Do you have nicknames
for each other?

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.000
What does he call you
in intimate moments?

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.520
Excuse me, I don't see--

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.360
Come in, Valli.
I need to see you.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.720
I don't see what relevance
this might have--

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.920
Every detail is important,
my dear lady.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:34.880
We mustn't neglect
even the smallest detail.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.760
Hello.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.880
Dr. Valli, our esteemed colleague.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.880
Would you show him
the picture of the subject?

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.000
Is it really necessary
to leave them here?

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.800
Indispensable.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.120
Forgive me
this most deplorable indiscretion.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.680
My questions are
not yet finished.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.880
Have you found lipstick
on his handkerchiefs?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.800
A woman's perfume,
not your own?

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.920
A whiff of beauty cream?

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.760
Hairs on his coat?

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.480
And-- forgive me--
scratches on his body?

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.080
No, never.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.680
Let's hear what
our psychologist has to say.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:26.640
From the photo, I'd say we're dealing
with a man between 38 and 45...

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.080
not easy-going,
though apparently docile.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.360
Cold rages.
Success with the ladies.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.600
One must be careful,
for he could lose his head, yes.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.840
Suppressed fears.
Great need of his mother.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.000
Who doesn't need his mother?

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.920
Dearest lady,
from this moment on...

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.960
every minute of our days and nights
will be dedicated to you.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.600
Right, Valli?

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.560
In one week you'll know everything
your husband does in a day.

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.720
Our zoom cameras make secrecy
an outdated concept.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.840
Doors and walls
mean nothing to us.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.120
We'll show you your husband
as you've never known him.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.080
You'll penetrate
that shadowy zone...

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.480
where you've never been able
to enter before.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.860
Are you certain
you want to know?

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.780
Woe be unto him
who tolerates a sinner...

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.420
for he becomes an accomplice
in his sin...

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.100
and will burn with him
in eternal flames.

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.380
Take vengeance.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.220
I am the Lord of justice.

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:43.900
Yes, I want to know.

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:47.020
It's my right.

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.820
I no longer know who he is,
what belongs to me...

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.660
or what I mean to him.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.220
I must know what he thinks,
what he does.

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.500
I want to know everything,
everything about him.

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.580
But I haven't gained weight,
signora.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:49.220
Haven't you? Any more
and you'll break the platform.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.220
Giulietta, do you like Nadir?

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.340
What lengths I went to
to find an archangel...

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.020
and he was right here all along.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.780
He's the doorman's son.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.580
Oh, there's chocolate
in the refrigerator. Have some.

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:02.740
You haven't seen these new works,
have you?

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.740
Seeing them is not enough.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.860
You have to touch them.
Go ahead.

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:11.300
I get a shock when I touch them,
as if they were alive.

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:14.540
Michelangelo told his Moses,
"Why don't you speak?"

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.420
I want to tell
these powerful figures...

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.940
"Make love to me!"

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.620
I mean it!

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:25.380
My art is deeply spiritual.
You don't think so, do you?

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:28.460
I want to restore
God's physicality.

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.780
I used to fear God.

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.820
He crushed me,
he terrified me.

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:36.940
Why? Because I imagined Him
theoretically, abstractly.

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:40.500
But He's really the most beautiful
body that ever was...

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.300
so that's how I try to portray Him.

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.740
A physical God, made of flesh...

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.900
a perfectly-formed hero...

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:49.940
whom I can desire
and even take as a lover.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.420
I, on the other hand,
when I was little...

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.780
thought God hid
behind a big door...

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.180
that was always closed...

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:10.180
covered with dust...

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:13.740
in the little theater
in the convent.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:22.460
The play that year
was about a martyred saint.

01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.300
I was chosen for the part.

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:52.300
What innocent eyes you have,
Giulietta.

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:55.260
You look like
the saint herself.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.460
Did she see God?

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:02.220
Yes, when she flew to heaven
in the flames of martyrdom.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:06.220
Promise you'll tell me everything.

01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.860
Ask Him if He loves me.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:11.660
- For sure?
- Yes, Laura, I'll ask Him.

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.780
Come on, Giulietta,
it's your cue.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.940
Arrest her!

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:25.980
Bring her before me!

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.580
Your religion is against
the laws of the empire!

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.780
But we are merciful
and inclined to pardon.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.380
Do you renounce your faith...

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:40.020
and bow to the emperor?

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.020
No, never!

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.980
You prefer a martyr's death?
You accept martyrdom?

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.740
Yes, I accept it.

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:50.020
There is still time,
if you wish to save yourself.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.500
Not the salvation
which you intend.

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.860
I wish only to save my soul.

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.180
The emperor's orders.

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.220
Burn the Christian!

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.800
That's enough!

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.720
Shameful! Indecent!

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.960
Give me back my granddaughter!
Giulietta, come down from there!

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.040
Obey your grandfather.
Come down from there!

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.080
Professor, in the name of God!

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.880
Come to your senses!
Stop this shameful behavior!

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.240
You're the ones who must stop.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.920
I am perfectly in my senses.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.800
Burning this child!
Are we among cannibals?

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.560
Bring down that contraption.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.800
Bring it down!
You beasts!

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.080
Go home, children.
Get away from there! Scat!

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:12.600
You nuns should fry on the grill,
but you're afraid to show your legs.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.279
What are you teaching
these children?

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:18.279
Are you trying to drive
these poor innocents to insanity?

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.240
Roast each other
on your old grill!

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:25.359
I order you to desist!
Come down!

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:27.399
Remember, I'm your principal.

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.240
You must obey me!

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:31.720
Your conduct is abominable!

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.080
Oh, shut up, Abominable.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.120
And what about you!
Have you nothing to say?

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:41.960
You let them do anything?
You like being roasted?

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.479
Stupid girl!

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.479
Giulietta, did you see God?
Answer me.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.479
Did you? Answer me!

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.880
Signora, I implore you,
pardon this outrageous incident...

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.040
which dishonors our school.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.480
Please accept
my most abject apologies.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.680
Where did that cat
come from?

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.400
It's not one of ours.
I don't know.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.320
But did you see what
big, bad yellow eyes it has?

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.320
- He's from the villa next door.
- He's gorgeous.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.680
Stop. I want to catch him.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.480
He went inside.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.320
Gasperino, help us catch him.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.680
Signora, I don't get along
with cats.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.280
Careful, signora.
He might scratch.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.840
Can we keep him?

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.000
They're terrible critters.
They bite and scratch.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.880
They're not dangerous.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.280
What a big fat kitty you are!

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.920
Gorgeous!

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.640
"Suzy." Your name is Suzy.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.200
The gate is open.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:03.000
What a pretty house you have!

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.520
Hello.
Excuse me, signora.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.160
Health and wealth to you all!

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.880
May God make you
ever more beautiful for His glory!

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.000
Signora, have him tell you
the story about the Barletta convent.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.920
Come here.

01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.640
Am I good?

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.960
You're an angel!
Till tomorrow.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.320
Mama, take Alyosha away.
I need to talk on the phone.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.320
Hello?

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.040
You see, signora?
He goes on like this all day.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.800
He's a good boy...

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:22.160
but he's committed the folly
of falling in love with my daughter.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.720
His powers of seduction
are all on the inside.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.400
One can't see them
on the outside.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.800
Woman are seduced
by beautiful appearances, Alyosha...

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.040
and you have none at all,
not even a little!

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.760
Pretty kitty!

01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:51.060
- There's my vagabond!
- I found him in my garden...

01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:52.900
and thought I'd bring him back.

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:54.380
You're so kind.

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:56.740
He's so pretty, someone might
steal him if you don't watch out.

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.540
Did you hear that?
They'll steal you!

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:01.420
Shut up!
Take him away!

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:04.100
Where were you?

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.700
- Did you thank signora...
- Giulietta.

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:12.900
What a pretty name! I'm Suzy.
Did he give you any trouble?

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.420
No, he's very good.

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:19.420
But he's a big drunk.
He likes champagne.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.580
Oh, the phone!

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.140
A lady from next door
brought the cat back.

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.420
Of course, all my friends
are pretty.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:37.580
Perhaps.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.260
What a bully
Please, excuse me.

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:49.820
It's really time
we were acquainted.

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:52.180
I don't want to disturb you.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.660
- Have a drink. A little champagne?
- Thank you.

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.020
None for you!

01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:00.460
- Can you stay for lunch?
- Thanks, but I really can't.

01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:03.700
We'll send them all away
and I'll cook. What do you like?

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:06.660
I can't open it. Alberto!

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.860
You're gorgeous,
all sweaty like that.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:12.940
Don't worry,
I'm not after anything.

01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:19.620
I'll tell Suzy what you did.

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:25.540
Some lovely champagne
for signora Giulietta.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.100
Paolo, come here!

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.860
Just a little for you, eh?

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.900
You know what happens
when you drink. You go mad.

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:40.580
Please forgive the mess.

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.060
I'm remodeling the house.

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:46.100
I want brighter colors.
Would you like a tour?

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:48.980
What luck!

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:51.620
I'm sure you'll give me
wonderful advice.

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:53.580
Welcome, Giulietta!

01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:58.700
Once I dreamt of you
in a kind of church.

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.740
You were up front,
at a desk like the teacher's desk.

01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:04.620
And I was in the last row,
dressed as a nun.

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:08.460
You said, "Show me how you walk!"
So I walked like this.

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:11.180
You flunked me.
How I cried!

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.620
I woke up in tears.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:17.500
Come to our party Saturday,
and bring your husband, of course.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.900
I've watched you both from my window
and grown fond of you.

01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:24.060
I would love to be able
to love one man that way.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.980
This is my grandmother.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.900
She hasn't slept in five years.

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:32.140
She's always up here.
She sees everything.

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.620
Granny Olga, this is my friend
Giulietta. Do you like her?

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:37.900
What's wrong, my dear?

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:41.260
She scares me when she says
things like that.

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:43.980
She only has to look at you
and she knows your secrets.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.460
- Everything passes.
- Good-bye, signora.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:53.820
How is she?

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:57.420
A little better, I think,
but I heard crying all night.

01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:00.460
Excuse me a moment.

01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:03.500
Arlette, it's me.

01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:07.020
Arlette, please.

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.660
Giulietta, come here.

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:20.020
You haven't touched
anything on your plate.

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:23.180
Know what I'll do?
I'll phone signora Artemia!

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:26.020
She won't stand
for any nonsense.

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.780
Come on, sit up.

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:33.100
Sit up, or I'll tell Roby
to go away.

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.620
Don't worry.

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:43.420
She's a friend of mine,
and she loves you. Right, Giulietta?

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.300
Of course.

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:50.580
Here, drink a little of this.

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:57.540
Why won't you believe
that we all love you?

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:01.380
I'll come back
and see you later.

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.300
What's wrong with her?

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:12.540
She tried three times
to commit suicide.

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.140
The last time we saved her
by a miracle.

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:17.420
I called and called,
but no one answered.

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:20.620
We broke down the door.
What a mess!

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:24.380
She's ill-fated in love.
I keep her here now.

01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:26.580
Like Laura, a school friend
of mine.

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:29.220
She jumped into a canal.
She was 15.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:31.900
They said it was an accident...

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:35.060
but it was suicide.
She did it for love.

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.420
Take this one.
It even has feathers.

01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:44.300
What are you doing here?
I'm fed up!

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:48.260
But I told him.
I said, "She'll be furious."

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:51.180
Didn't I tell you?

01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:53.900
How dare you come sneaking
up here?

01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:55.580
Taking my things!

01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:57.820
He only took a slipper!

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.820
This is my house,
and I give the orders here!

01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:02.620
Otherwise I'll send you back
to the streets where I found you!

01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:06.820
- This one was in a whorehouse.
- You know you'd like to be in one.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:11.020
And why not?

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:14.020
The dirty tales she tells.

01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.740
All made up, naturally.

01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:19.340
We're only joking, of course.
What else can we do?

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.820
Giulietta, how are you?

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.580
Iris keeps her promise,
you see.

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:33.020
Suzy is your teacher.
Listen to her. Follow her.

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.620
I mustn't encourage
your fetishism, Alyosha...

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.700
because this is fetishism,
pure and simple.

01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:41.700
Momy explained it all to me.
But here, you can have this.

01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:55.420
It can't be easy
being a fetishist.

01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.180
For a Russian,
it must be terrible.

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.100
Come look!

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.660
How many times
I've watched you in your garden.

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:16.300
Come here, Giulietta.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:19.860
Look!

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.500
Do you have a mirror
on your ceiling too?

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:25.860
Like it?

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:31.980
I had it put there.
Momy was delighted.

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:36.140
It's like having
another couple along.

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:40.140
What must you think of me!

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:43.380
But, you know,
men like funny things.

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:55.580
Come on in, the water's warm.

01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.900
Another idea of mine.

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.940
After we make love,
we plunge in here.

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:02.820
It's wonderful!

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.220
Come on, Giulietta.
Take off your clothes.

01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:10.340
Once Momy slid down headfirst
and he almost got stuck.

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:14.020
Come on, dive in!

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:01.820
I burn my candle on both ends.
I deny myself nothing.

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.740
Look, what's up there?

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:05.860
I eat, dance, play...

01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:07.380
and fight.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.460
I especially like to fight.

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:13.340
We'll go take some sun.

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.540
Up there...

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:24.300
it's much better
than the beach.

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.820
It's my private sun.
All mine.

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:32.220
The switch is on that tree.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:36.980
- We're going up there?
- Certainly. Flip the switch.

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:45.380
In Greece there's
a hilltop monastery.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.820
The monks ride like this.

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.780
Send it back.

01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:59.020
Do I raise the switch?

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:02.380
That's it!
Now it's your turn.

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.220
- Ready?
- Yes.

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.460
Don't be afraid.

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:36.020
If you're dizzy,
close your eyes.

01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:54.060
Give me your hand.

01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:55.780
No, thanks,
I can manage myself.

01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:57.020
They can look all they want.

01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:00.020
They'll never find us.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:01.580
We've thrown them off.

01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.460
Who?

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:07.140
Those two boys following us.
Didn't you see them?

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:14.580
Yesterday there were two lovers
in those bushes.

01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.460
How they made love!

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.660
I felt like applauding,
they were so wonderful.

01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:23.180
From here it seemed so delicate,
so festive.

01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:27.060
Is your head still spinning?
Let's have something to drink.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.500
The sun's at its zenith,
the loveliest time.

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:32.460
At this hour
you cast no shadow.

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:34.300
Ah, rainwater...

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:36.980
with two minnows in it.

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:42.380
Sit down. Take off your clothes.
We'll sunbathe nude.

01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:45.300
No, thanks. I'm fine like this.

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:49.220
Granny makes strange perfume
out of resin and flowers.

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:50.860
I'll let you try them out.

01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:52.660
They make men drunk.

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:54.460
An engineer once--

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:56.900
What were you telling me
about your marriage?

01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:58.820
Oh, no, nothing.

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:00.540
Don't you trust me?

01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:04.460
- Yes, but--
- Well, then? Tell me about it.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:08.180
You've never thought
of marrying?

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:16.820
I always thought marriage
should be like this.

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.740
I would be all his,
and he would be all mine.

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:23.540
I'm almost ashamed to admit it,
but Giorgio was my first love.

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:26.580
I fell in love
the moment I saw him...

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.900
and wanted nothing else
but to live with him.

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:33.860
When he proposed, I was so happy
I almost didn't believe it.

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:36.940
He became my entire world....

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:39.460
my husband, my lover...

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:40.780
my father, my friend...

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.140
my home!

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.020
I didn't need anybody else.

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:50.700
I thought that was right,
and I was happy.

01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:04.380
Could they be at the beach?
They've vanished.

01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:06.100
There they are, up there!

01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:09.540
- What are you doing?
- See? They found us.

01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:10.940
Naughty boys!

01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:13.820
We have something important
to tell you.

01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:16.700
- Do you know them?
- Never saw them before.

01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:19.420
Tell me more about your marriage.
It's such a beautiful story.

01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:22.460
I was engaged once at 13.

01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:25.540
Oh, I dropped it!

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:32.020
Excuse me, Suzy, but it's late.
I'd better get home.

01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.220
What, you're going already?

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.660
Send me down, please.

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:44.580
Bye, Giulietta.
Come up whenever you like.

01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.620
Hello. How are you?

01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:04.580
- You're leaving? Stay with us.
- No, thank you.

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:14.380
I'll get off at the first floor.

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:43.220
"Among the trials
was that of the labyrinth...

01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:45.340
which was the worst.

01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:49.460
The labyrinth was a great palace
which, once you entered...

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.140
you could never leave again.

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:54.180
You wandered and went in circles
until finally you were lost."

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.060
Teresina, what's wrong?

01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:00.140
I'm depressed.

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:04.980
May I leave a little early today?

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:08.540
"But Jack the Giant-Killer, who wasn't
afraid of even the devil himself...

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:12.100
said, 'I'll enter the labyrinth.'"

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.180
Yes, you can go, Teresina.

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:17.620
"But what will you give me
if I succeed in coming out again?"

01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:20.060
But I really don't like
your new habit...

01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:22.380
of leaving every day
between 3:00 and 8:00.

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:27.580
"So they crossed a forest
full of golden apples...

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:32.020
so many apples
shining so brightly...

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.180
that even at night
the forest was full of light."

01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:38.660
- Is the lady of the house in?
- This is she. Who is this?

01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:40.180
Eagle Eye Detective Service.

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:42.180
Just a moment, please.

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:45.260
Go play outside.
I'll be right there.

01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:51.860
Can you visit our office
this afternoon?

01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:53.700
Today?

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:55.820
No... I don't know.

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:57.980
Have you already
found something?

01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:00.620
We've had seven days
of hard work.

01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:03.060
You'll appreciate our labors.

01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:05.140
Can't you tell me
over the phone?

01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:10.980
- Frankly, it's not our custom to do so.
- Of course not.

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:12.900
We'll expect you in our office.

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.700
I'll do my best to be there.

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:24.060
Good afternoon, signora.
We've done it!

01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:27.620
I can honestly report
our results are brilliant.

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:31.460
I think we'll reveal
what you want to know.

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:34.020
I understand your anxiety,
dear lady.

01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:37.780
But believe me, there's nothing
final or irreparable.

01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:40.780
Please, make yourself
comfortable.

01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:45.580
If you knew how many couples
have reconciled right here--

01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:47.180
A drink, signora?

01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:51.500
True love requires
a total knowledge of each other.

01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:53.420
Even Saint Augustine said so.

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:55.700
- Don't consider this a sad occasion.
- No, thank you.

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:02.580
The exposure may not be perfect
on these images...

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:07.180
but you can imagine
the working conditions.

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:11.900
These are the first three days of our
investigation, the 23rd to the 25th.

01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:15.900
If you'll allow me,
I'll read you the report.

01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:19.540
"On the 23rd,
the subject went out at 7:30...

01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:21.220
dressed in a white suit.

01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:24.980
We trailed his car
to a florist."

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:33.220
Needless to say, we have all
the relevant information on the woman...

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:38.260
who received the floral arrangement,
which is at your complete disposal.

01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:43.060
There she is!

01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:45.460
Captured while entering
a restaurant.

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:49.780
Alas, the hat brim prevents
identification of the person.

01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:57.340
What I always recommend
to my clients...

01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:00.900
is a certain detachment
from what we show them.

01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:04.540
Our point of view is objective
and hence limited.

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:07.100
The reality might be
something else...

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:09.060
more innocent.

01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.940
This is Lake Bracciano, isn't it?

01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.100
No, it's a field near Castelli.

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:17.860
"On the 24th...

01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:21.740
an afternoon drive
on the Appian Way.

01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:25.620
They were parked in the fields
from 4:20 till 6:00."

01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:29.220
The lady's name
is Gabriella Olsen.

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.060
She's 24 years old,
a model by profession.

01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:37.020
While we change reels,
let's see some slides.

01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:42.060
I took these myself.

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:46.180
We recorded
their conversation...

01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:48.900
when they stopped
in the park.

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:53.620
You mistake me
for someone else.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:55.420
When we met you had--

01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:04.820
You should be flattered
by what I'm telling you.

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:08.060
I'm showing you like an idiot
how jealous I am.

01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:10.620
- What would you change in me?
- You're perfect.

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:15.460
The interpretation of this
is up to you.

01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:18.380
"As agreed herein, the evidence
remains sealed in our keeping...

01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:24.180
unless specifically requested
by the court or the judge."

01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:27.660
You gave us 100,000 lira
for our expenses and equipment...

01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:31.140
transportation, per diem,
extras, overtime and so on.

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:34.620
Here's an itemized invoice
for you.

01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:38.660
Believe me, we gave you
very special treatment.

01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:45.060
Thank you.

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.500
Good day.

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:49.940
My compliments, signora.

01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:53.420
My coworkers join me
in saying...

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.740
we hope this situation
ends happily, and as you wish.

01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:26.380
Look, it's your charming neighbor.

01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.900
I knew you'd come.
How are you?

01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:35.460
Did you pack your husband
off to bed?

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:40.260
Listen, Suzy,
when will we begin?

01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:43.700
He's not home yet.
My husband is always late.

01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:46.340
He works so hard.

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:50.420
So I came alone.
He trusts me completely.

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.100
He shouldn't!

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.340
You already know my mother.
Don't wake her.

01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.980
She'll start singing!

01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:06.140
He can rely on the advice
of the prophet for his moves!

01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:09.180
Momy, this is Giulietta.

01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:12.220
Thank you for honoring my house.

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:17.020
Do you realize who he is?

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:20.660
That's my boyfriend Momy.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:22.420
He's 65 years old...

01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:24.940
but he wants to make love
every day.

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.540
And he does!

01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:33.220
What's the matter?
You look so sad.

01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:37.180
Me, sad? I'm perfectly fine.

01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:40.540
In fact, I want to enjoy myself.

01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:41.780
Good!

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:44.460
I feel like hugging everyone.

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:47.940
I want you to be happy.

01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:12.500
Attention, please.
This is the most secret part.

01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:17.900
Now, the deceased
has captured the winds...

01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:20.980
and each maiden becomes
a symbol of purification.

01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:23.860
This is
the old Egyptian rite...

01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:26.700
for the passage
from life to death.

01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.940
I'm the goddess of vice.

01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:33.140
An hour with me
might kill you...

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:36.620
but you'd have touched
the heights and depths of pleasure.

01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:38.700
This is my hour!

01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:43.020
I reach my peak of desire
at 11:00.

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:47.340
It's a game we play
in Lola's honor.

01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:50.460
We create the atmosphere
of a brothel.

01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.060
Amusing.

01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:54.900
Then you look into his eyes.

01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:57.900
This one,
with the beautiful big nose.

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.660
The gentleman
hasn't chosen yet?

01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:04.140
Lola, is this all right?

01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.020
That's perfect.

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:09.220
- I make an offer: a week in Japan.
- Shame on you!

01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:11.180
- All right, then, two weeks.
- Tightwad!

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:13.060
- But in Japan!
- It's too little.

01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:19.420
- Kneel down! What's your name?
- Hildegard.

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:22.060
No, your name is Sex.
What's your name?

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:25.540
No, now your name is Womb.
What's your name?

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:29.700
No, now your name
is that of the goddess.

01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:32.180
Now you are no longer yourself.

01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:34.620
You are the door, the earth.

01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:37.700
And now the resting place
of the goddess.

01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:43.340
You're very pretty.
Are you a model?

01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:49.100
Do you know
a certain Gabriella?

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:51.180
- Who?
- Gabriella Olsen.

01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:52.540
I know her.

01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:55.300
- They say she's very pretty.
- Yes.

01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:56.620
Much prettier than me?

01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:59.100
Very pretty!

01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:04.940
And something of a whore,
right?

01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:07.020
You can tell me.

01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:10.500
For me, it's become almost
a compliment.

01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:33.340
Do I play the part well?

01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:35.580
Isn't she perfect, Lola?

01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:42.820
That's my godson.
Isn't he handsome?

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:11.260
Giulietta, I'm up here.

01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.500
Come on.

01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:31.820
Go away!

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:44.060
What do you want?

01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.380
He's waiting.

01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.380
He wants you.

01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:39.540
The champagne.

01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:53.220
Suzy is your teacher.

01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:55.620
Listen to her. Follow her.

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.940
Perhaps I drank too much.

01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:06.980
What are you doing?

01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:00.700
I'm hours late, huh?

01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:02.380
- How are you?
- Have you seen Giulietta?

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:05.660
No, I haven't seen her.
Where are you going dressed like that?

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:07.140
To your confirmation?

01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:10.100
- What are you doing?
- She's psychoanalyzing my wife.

01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:12.380
Is the American doctor here?

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:16.180
Now go and concentrate.
Stay in there and try to remember.

01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.260
I want to see what happens
when it's your turn.

01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:22.980
Dangerous!

01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:27.020
- I know you're afraid.
- No, Giorgio, for goodness' sake!

01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:32.460
To every psychodrama
each person must bring the truth.

01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:37.260
We must create a climate
of absolute verity.

01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:40.620
I'm really not very good
at this.

01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:44.620
Try and relive for us the time
you scolded your son-in-law.

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.740
Will you be the son-in-law?

01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:52.900
- He's too old!
- Thanks for the compliment.

01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:55.340
Let's try this handsome
young man.

01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:57.580
He'll be much better.

01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:59.380
Excuse me.
I was reading his palm.

01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:04.940
The future doesn't interest me...

01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:08.780
only what happens to me
today, right now!

01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:15.420
Forgive me.
I won't do it again!

01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:19.100
Signora, they're waiting
for you.

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.620
I'm coming.

01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:29.220
That's enough! Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:04.660
Shameless liar!

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.180
I'll never believe you again.

01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.060
Go away!

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:11.140
Go away!

01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:14.820
Who are you talking to?

01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:16.780
Nobody.

01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:19.020
- Who were you talking to?
- Nobody.

01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:27.860
Come on, Giulietta,
we're all waiting.

01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:30.900
Doctor, let me do
a psychodrama.

01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:32.860
There's a shady episode
in my life.

01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:44.340
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks. I don't drink.

01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:47.740
Dr. Miller's been showing us
a new game: psychodrama.

01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:51.940
You relive your worst moments,
projected onto another person.

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:53.860
Interesting, huh?

01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:56.980
What a strange crowd
you have here, today.

01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:03.780
Cheers!

01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:05.900
Your housecoat's pretty.

01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:08.140
Your eyes are red.
You've been crying.

01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:12.220
I find these games
extremely boring.

01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:14.700
Don't take a plane
on the 27th.

01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:17.220
Ah, the mistress of the house!

01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:18.900
How pretty you are!

01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:21.380
Of course, with such
a pretty mama.

01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:23.500
Want to bet it's a boy?

01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:25.860
Remember, I predicted it.

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:27.860
Giulietta, psychodrama is not
a game.

01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:30.860
Why don't you try,
little sad face?

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:33.980
Quiet, it's Giulietta's turn.

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:37.540
- Maybe Giulietta doesn't want to.
- Yes, I want to. I'm fine.

01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:39.220
She wants to.

01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:42.660
It's a marvelous experience.
You'll feel psychologically liberated.

01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:45.820
Like seeing yourself in a mirror
right there in front of you.

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:49.700
You'll understand
your problems in no time.

01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:52.580
Tell us about the most painful episode
of your life.

01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:56.780
Recreate for us
the people, the circumstances.

01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:00.300
Is it true?

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:04.020
Can you really help me?

01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:12.020
There, they've started again!

01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:18.100
Go away!

01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:20.940
Go away!

01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:25.900
- What were you saying?
- Nothing. It's just a game.

01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:27.660
Give me that.

01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:31.980
Try to smoke less...
and have faith in your doctor.

01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:34.700
Can't you see them?

01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:36.380
Can't you hear them?

01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:39.180
Take your revenge!

01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:42.620
Forgive!
But whom should I listen to?

01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:45.220
Make yourself beautiful.
Life is all sacrifices.

01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:48.220
Be more feminine,
we'll teach you.

01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:51.300
My life is full of people
who talk, talk, talk.

01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:54.380
Go away, all of you!

01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:12.300
It's water.

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:16.940
When I want purity
and absolute sincerity...

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:19.180
I ask for water.

01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:21.740
We need simple things to live.

01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:24.100
Things which hide nothing.

01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:26.940
Water is like a truthful gaze.

01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:29.900
Never be afraid of the truth.

01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:31.940
The truth sets us free.

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:37.020
What does it matter
what others think, anyway?

01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:42.660
There's a proverb in my country:
"l am mine own roof and hearth.

01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:44.460
My words are my food.

01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:47.860
My thoughts are... my drink.

01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.860
Thus I am happy."

01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:54.020
Are you real or not?

01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:56.380
What do you advise?

01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:58.380
What should I do?

01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:03.020
I can't advise you.
I only want for you to live fully.

01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:09.340
Where's Giorgio?

01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:11.740
Giulietta, you know
what he said?

01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:20.180
I'm sorry, signora.
I forgot to tell you.

01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:21.700
Your husband left.

01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:24.740
He didn't want to interrupt
your dancing.

01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:27.780
He said to say good-bye to the guests.
He had somebody arriving from Brazil.

01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:30.140
He may not be home
for supper.

01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:31.940
But he said he'd call.

01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:40.260
Giulietta, listen
to my advice.

01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:43.260
Proof of adultery
is no longer required.

01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:46.220
Circumstantial evidence
is enough for the law.

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:49.060
I speak now
not as your lawyer...

01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:52.660
but as a friend who cherishes
and loves you.

01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:56.420
Is there any chance for me?

01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:00.500
You must consider
these things.

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:10.300
I'm bold enough to think
I know your trouble.

01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:12.020
I may be able to help you.

01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:15.660
You identify too much
with your problem.

01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:25.900
These great trees make the most
impressive symbol of this way of living.

01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:28.340
Deeply rooted in the earth...

01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:32.140
yet the branches stretch out
in all directions.

01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:35.180
Their growth is spontaneous.

01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:38.020
This is the great
and simple truth you must learn:

01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:40.420
Be yourself, spontaneously...

01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:44.980
without fighting your desires
and passions.

01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:47.940
Don't you feel
how nice it is here?

01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:50.780
Sometimes one must speak
out loud...

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:54.500
even if it's a stranger
who's listening.

01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:58.100
Stretch out on the grass.

01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:02.020
Relax.
Don't be afraid.

01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:06.900
Look at the sun
through the branches.

01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:10.140
All is at peace.
All is serene.

01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:15.140
But you, you're not at peace.

01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:17.100
Why?

01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:20.780
I don't know.

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.820
What are you afraid of?

01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:25.220
May I answer for you?

01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:27.940
You're afraid of being alone...

01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:29.660
of being abandoned.

01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:32.540
You're afraid your husband
will leave you.

01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:35.460
But, really, that's what
you most want.

01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:38.540
You desire with all your might
to be left alone.

01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:40.540
You long for your husband
to go away.

01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:45.420
I want Giorgio to leave me?

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:52.740
Precisely. Without Giorgio,
you begin to breathe, to live.

01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:54.620
You become yourself.

01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:57.700
You think you're afraid.

01:52:57.940 --> 01:53:00.300
But in fact
you fear only one thing:

01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:03.100
You're afraid of being happy.

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:09.380
Signorina Gabriella Olsen.

01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:12.380
She's not here,
but she should be back soon.

01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:16.700
Excuse me, I was just
cleaning up a bit.

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:20.260
She phoned around noon to say
that she'd be out for lunch.

01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:22.500
She's out a lot these days.

01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:25.140
Please sit down.
May I offer you something?

01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:29.700
Excuse me, but I have to finish
packing her suitcases.

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:37.700
The poor girl has waited so long
to take this trip with her boyfriend.

01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:39.900
Everything was all ready.

01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:43.100
But he calls at the last minute
and says, "We can't leave now."

01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:46.540
Not out of meanness,
'cause he's a real gentleman.

01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:49.940
I've never seen anyone
so in love with signora Gabriella.

01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:53.540
And I must say she deserves it.

01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:57.420
I shouldn't say this,
since we're related...

01:53:57.540 --> 01:53:59.780
but they're so sweet together.

01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:03.580
He says he feels at home here.

01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:07.140
He chose all these things
himself.

01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.100
All in good taste.

01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:21.100
Yes, I'm packing
your suitcases now.

01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:24.100
There's a lady waiting to see you.
I don't know.

01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:25.900
I don't know her.

01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:29.900
Shall I put her on?

01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:33.580
Would you like to speak
to signora Gabriella?

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:35.140
I certainly do.

01:54:35.260 --> 01:54:37.220
Just a moment.

01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:40.100
Go ahead and pick up.

01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:41.580
The telephone is behind you.

01:54:58.500 --> 01:54:59.940
Hello. Who is this?

01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:01.820
I'm Giorgio's wife.

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:05.380
Delighted to meet you,
but did we have an appointment?

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.940
No, but I want to talk to you.

01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:11.100
May I be of help?
Can't you tell me on the phone?

01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:12.700
I'll wait here.
I'm in no hurry.

01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:15.740
It's no use...
I mean, for you to wait.

01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:18.700
I have a busy afternoon.
I'll be late.

01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:21.260
Are you afraid?

01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:23.500
Afraid? No.

01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:26.180
But I don't enjoy gloating
over the defeat of others.

01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:28.580
And I don't think we have anything
to say to each other.

01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:30.820
Good-bye and good luck.

01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:33.100
I'm not moving.

01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:44.260
I have to go now.

01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:49.460
I think signora Gabriella
will be very late.

01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:54.420
I'm sorry, but--

01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:22.620
Good evening, signora.

01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:25.740
I'm fixing supper for signor Giorgio
because he has to leave.

01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:29.020
Our happiness...

01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:30.820
Put the bags in the car.

01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:32.940
...has only one name.

01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:36.580
I'm going to Milan.
I'll eat and run.

01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:40.220
- I'll fix it for you.
- Don't bother. Teresina's doing it.

01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:56.180
Did you add salt?

01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:01.260
What did you make
for a vegetable?

01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:03.300
Some salad.

01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:10.740
It's ready, sir.

01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:19.900
- Is the car trunk unlocked?
- Yes.

01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:22.460
I'll put the bags in.

01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:37.980
This is the first time
you've packed your bags yourself.

01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:45.940
You haven't forgotten anything?

01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:48.060
No, I don't think so.

01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:49.780
Will you be gone long?

01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:53.060
I don't know, a couple of days.

01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:54.820
I'll call you.

01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:01.060
Shall I close the windows?

01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:05.740
May I go out for a while?

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:26.980
Listen, Giulietta,
I may be gone longer.

01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:29.220
I don't feel very well.

01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:31.900
I saw the doctor today.
I didn't tell you.

01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:46.700
- Do you want some fruit?
- Yes, thank you.

01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:03.460
Perhaps work has tired me out
lately.

01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:06.740
The doctor said
nothing's wrong...

01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:09.300
but a rest
would do me good.

01:59:10.980 --> 01:59:14.100
Frankly, I need
some time alone.

01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:35.140
At last we have the pleasure
of meeting you!

01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:36.980
Giulietta has told us so much
about you.

01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:39.580
You're much better
than we imagined.

01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:42.980
Mama, this is
Giulietta's fiance.

01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:45.420
How do you do?

01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:54.460
I think you've heard
malicious gossip...

01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:56.780
mean tongues, rumors.

01:59:56.940 --> 02:00:00.580
Yes, it's true, I've had
a friendship with this person...

02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:03.380
even a deep friendship,
but nothing more.

02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:07.420
I assure you, nothing final
or irreparable.

02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:10.980
The truth is... I don't know.

02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:15.100
I'm going through a moment
of uncertainty, of confusion...

02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:17.580
I want to be alone.

02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:34.220
Well, good-bye, Giulietta.

02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:51.860
I'll phone you.

02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:54.100
Yes, of course.

02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:56.900
- I'll call you as soon as I get there.
- All right.

02:00:57.500 --> 02:00:59.820
I'm not sure when.
Perhaps tomorrow.

02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:03.300
Ah, put my mail aside.

02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:05.420
Of course, the mail.

02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:55.620
Giulietta,
do you remember me?

02:02:56.660 --> 02:02:57.580
Laura!

02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:01.740
Do as I did!

02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:06.500
Here everything
is gray stillness and silence.

02:03:07.420 --> 02:03:09.740
Come with me, Giulietta.

02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:13.380
A long sleep.

02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:15.780
No more suffering.

02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:01.140
It's not true!

02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:04.300
None of you exist!
Go away!

02:04:21.180 --> 02:04:22.820
Very tasty!

02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:29.140
You don't exist!
Go away!

02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:39.860
It's your friend Laura
who killed herself for love.

02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:48.980
Buy a horse, take long rides
and swims.

02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:54.580
Is there any hope for me?

02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:58.180
Without Giorgio,
you'll begin to breathe...

02:04:58.380 --> 02:04:59.940
to be yourself.

02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:03.780
Spent the whole evening with me,
the whole evening with me.

02:05:08.980 --> 02:05:11.740
I can't get down.
I can't land.

02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:14.300
It's your fault, Giulietta.

02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:19.100
A long sleep...

02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:06.540
Mama, please help me!

02:06:18.100 --> 02:06:19.540
I hear crying.

02:06:19.660 --> 02:06:21.540
It's the wind.

02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:26.980
- They're calling me.
- Don't move.

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.460
- Obey your mother.
- I must go.

02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:31.140
Don't you move!

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:37.540
Who is it?
Who are you?

02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:38.820
Open!

02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:40.380
Don't open!

02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:41.940
Obey me!

02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:45.780
You no longer frighten me.

02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:02.460
Look who's here!
My little beef patty!

02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:04.980
Where'd you leave your grill?

02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:07.940
Let's say good-bye
to those bores.

02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:34.100
My cutie's waiting for me.

02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:35.940
We have to go too.

02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:38.180
Take me along!

02:08:39.180 --> 02:08:40.100
Where?

02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:42.820
This is an old plane...

02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:44.660
going nowhere.

02:08:44.740 --> 02:08:46.580
It was only meant
to come here.

02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:56.100
Good-bye, Giulietta.

02:08:57.460 --> 02:08:59.220
Don't try to hold on to me.

02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:01.900
You don't need me anymore.

02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:05.380
I'm nothing but another
of your inventions.

02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:08.020
But you are life.

02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:10.500
So long, beef patty!

02:09:57.660 --> 02:09:59.940
- Who are you?
- Friends.

02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:03.260
- Who are you?
- True friends.

02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:07.140
Now, if you like,
we can stay.

02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:11.740
Do you want us to?

02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:15.580
Listen! Listen well!
