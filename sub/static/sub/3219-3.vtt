-There was one thing.
-What?

17:20.247 --> 17:23.708
It's just,
the light hit his eyes in a weird way...

17:24.542 --> 17:26.377
...and for a moment, I could've sworn--

17:26.545 --> 17:28.796
What, that they were black?
Or red, maybe?

17:28.964 --> 17:30.673
No.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.633
They were yellow.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.720
Pale yellow.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.564
-Slow down and talk this thing through.
DEAN: There's nothing to talk about.

17:46.732 --> 17:50.359
You say it was a demon. None of us
has heard of a demon with yellow eyes.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.070
Yeah, well, I have.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.530
-This thing killed my family.
-Just calm down.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.908
You don't get it, do you?
We're all in danger.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.077
You need to get yourself someplace safe.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.245
Not until we know
what we're dealing with.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.165
It could be a demon, Shapeshifter,
any number of things.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.501
I know what this thing is.

18:06.668 --> 18:07.668
And I'm gonna kill it.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.755
-That's all the talking I need to do.
-You're gonna kill a demon? How?

18:10.923 --> 18:14.592
There's a hunter named Daniel Elkins.
Lives in Colorado. He has Colt's gun.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.387
-The Colt.
-Yeah. I heard about the Colt.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.598
Used to tell it to Mary as a bedtime story.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.808
Well, it's real.

18:25.145 --> 18:28.356
All right, say that it is.
You got some kind of a crystal ball...

18:28.524 --> 18:30.733
...telling you
where this demon's gonna be?

18:30.901 --> 18:33.027
Yeah, maybe I do.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.952
-What's this?
-It's a list.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.162
-Of what?
-My dad wrote down anyone...

18:43.330 --> 18:47.500
...he thought came in contact with the
yellow-eyed demon. Who, where, when.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.919
-Why?
-Because the more he could learn...

18:50.087 --> 18:52.839
...the more he could figure out
why he killed my mom.

18:56.426 --> 18:57.552
Look.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.556

I told you that name sounded familiar.

19:01.723 --> 19:05.810

-I know you guys think I'm crazy.
-You seem like a really nice kid, Dean.

19:32.087 --> 19:35.047
-But, yeah, you're crazy.
-Yeah, maybe.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.926

gonna be, and I'm gonna stop it.

Why do you ask?

Just curious.

...is the moment
that he caught her scent.

Now if we don't catch this thing now
and kill it, and it gets away...

like your mommy.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.917
Why her?

33:24.085 --> 33:26.920
-Why any of them?
-Because they're strong.

They're ideal breeders.

33:34.303 --> 33:37.723
Oh, get your mind out of the gutter.
No one's breeding with me.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.808
Though Mary....

33:40.977 --> 33:45.731
Man, I'd like to make an exception.
So far, she's my favorite.

33:46.315 --> 33:47.649
[GRUNTING]

33:51.195 --> 33:52.654
So why make the deals?

33:53.281 --> 33:56.408
I need permission.
I need to be invited into their houses.

33:56.617 --> 33:58.910
I know, I know.
The red tape will drive you nuts.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.328
But in 10 short years...

34:00.830 --> 34:05.208
...it'll all be worth it. Because you know
what I'm gonna do to your sibling?

34:05.376 --> 34:09.295
I'm gonna stand over their crib,
and I'm gonna bleed into their mouth.

34:09.464 --> 34:12.382
Demon blood is better
than Ovaltine, vitamins, minerals.

34:12.550 --> 34:16.344
-It makes you big and strong.
-For what?

34:16.512 --> 34:19.723
So they can lead
your discount demon army?

34:19.891 --> 34:23.185
-Is that your big plan?
-Please.

34:24.145 --> 34:27.563
My endgame's a hell of a lot bigger
than that, kid.

34:27.732 --> 34:30.275
Endgame? What endgame?

34:30.443 --> 34:32.652
Like I'm gonna tell you.

34:34.447 --> 34:37.199
Or those angels sitting on your shoulder.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.159
No.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.578
I'm gonna cover my tracks good.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.915
You can cover
whatever the hell you want.

34:45.333 --> 34:48.460
-I'm still gonna kill you.
-Right.

34:48.710 --> 34:50.337
Now, that I'd like to see.

34:50.963 --> 34:53.047
Maybe not today.

34:53.757 --> 34:58.011
But you look into my eyes,
you son of a bitch...

34:58.429 --> 35:00.388
...because I'm the one that kills you.

35:05.269 --> 35:06.686
[LAUGHING]

35:06.854 --> 35:09.940
SAMUEL: So you're gonna save
everybody, is that right? Is that it?

35:11.484 --> 35:15.695
Well, I'll tell you one person
that you're not gonna save.

35:15.863 --> 35:17.030
Your grandpappy.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.701
No.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.453
No!

35:26.374 --> 35:28.208
Ah!

35:57.280 --> 35:58.905
Mary. Mary!

36:02.410 --> 36:05.662
JOHN: I guess it's no secret
why I brought you way out here.

36:06.539 --> 36:09.249
-John--
-I just....

36:09.417 --> 36:13.670
-Just let me get through this, okay?
-Okay, wait.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.048
There's things
you don't know about me, John.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.134
So?

36:22.471 --> 36:26.933
I will always love you
for exactly who you are.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.273
[POUNDING]

36:33.441 --> 36:35.442
-What did I tell you?
-Dad.

36:35.610 --> 36:38.069
-Sir, just listen.
SAMUEL: Now, come on.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.821
-Dad.
SAMUEL: Stay away from her.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.072
You're hurting me.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.450
Hey, take it easy!

36:43.618 --> 36:45.285
MARY:
No.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.128
You killed him.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.381
Oh, not just John, sweetie pie.

37:00.843 --> 37:03.094
Mommy and Daddy too.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.306
They're all dead.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.060
-No.
-Yep. Afraid so.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.438
-You're little orphan Mary now.
-You son of a bitch.

37:13.606 --> 37:16.024
Sticks and stones
may break my bones.

37:18.152 --> 37:20.570
And they won't bring
your family back either.

37:20.738 --> 37:25.325
I'll kill you. I swear to God.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.161
Oh, let's not get nasty.

37:29.872 --> 37:33.458
Now, look, we've both said some things
that we regret.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.168
Let's...

37:37.546 --> 37:39.839
...kiss and make up.

37:40.841 --> 37:42.259
I'll tell you what.

37:42.426 --> 37:47.097
I'll arrange to have lover boy here
brought back breathing.

37:49.558 --> 37:53.019
-My parents too.
-Nope.

37:53.187 --> 37:55.105
Sorry, doll, it's not on the table.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.357
Think about it.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.567
You could be done with hunting forever.

37:59.735 --> 38:05.407
The white picket fence, station wagon,
couple of kids.

38:05.866 --> 38:10.537
No more monsters or fear.
I'll make sure of it.

38:10.705 --> 38:14.874
-What, and all it costs is my soul?
-Oh, no, you can keep your soul.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.584
I just need permission.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.508
For what?

38:23.884 --> 38:26.678
In 10 years, I need
to swing by your house for something.

38:26.887 --> 38:29.264
-For what?
-Relax.

38:31.434 --> 38:36.396
As long as I'm not interrupted,
nobody gets hurt.

38:36.564 --> 38:37.647
I promise.

38:45.323 --> 38:50.702
Or you can spend the rest of your life
desperate and alone.

38:51.537 --> 38:53.121
Mary?

38:53.289 --> 38:55.415
It's a good deal.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.419
So, what do you say?

39:15.728 --> 39:17.562
No!

39:18.939 --> 39:21.024
Ah!

39:43.798 --> 39:46.466
-Mary?
-John.

40:35.015 --> 40:37.350
I couldn't stop any of it.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.479
She still made the deal.

40:43.023 --> 40:45.692
She still died in the nursery, didn't she?

40:46.694 --> 40:48.987
Don't be too hard on yourself.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.448
You couldn't have stopped it.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.495
What?

40:58.372 --> 41:00.874
Destiny can't be changed, Dean.

41:03.752 --> 41:08.173
-All roads lead to the same destination.
-Then why'd you send me back?

41:08.340 --> 41:11.384
For the truth.
Now you know everything we do.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.720
What the hell are you talking about?

41:23.814 --> 41:24.856
Where's Sam?

41:25.900 --> 41:27.817
We know what Azazel did
to your brother.

41:27.985 --> 41:31.905
What we don't know is why.
What his endgame is.

41:32.072 --> 41:34.282
He went to great lengths
to cover that up.

41:35.534 --> 41:39.329
-Where's Sam?
-425 Waterman.

41:43.083 --> 41:46.002
Your brother is headed
down a dangerous road, Dean...

41:46.170 --> 41:48.338
...and we're not sure where it leads.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.006
So stop it...

41:51.425 --> 41:52.717
...or we will.
