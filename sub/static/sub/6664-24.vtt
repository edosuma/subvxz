00:00.066 --> 00:02.568
Adult adam: <i> Growing up,</i>
<i> my mom made every lunch bag</i>

00:02.570 --> 00:04.636
<i> An ornate tapestry</i>
<i> of her love for us.</i>

00:04.638 --> 00:06.939
<i> Each morning,</i>
<i> she made it her top priority</i>

00:06.941 --> 00:08.007
<i> To send us to school knowing</i>

00:08.009 --> 00:10.609
<i> That we meant</i>
<i> the world to her.</i>
(smooches)

00:10.611 --> 00:13.645
<i> And while none of her kids</i>
<i> ever really appreciated</i>

00:13.647 --> 00:14.513
<i> Her expressions of affection,</i>

00:14.515 --> 00:16.548
<i> That didn't stop my mom</i>
<i> from constantly declaring</i>

00:16.550 --> 00:19.885
<i> How she adored us</i>
<i> with every ounce of her soul.</i>

00:19.887 --> 00:21.453
I love you so much.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.855
I love you, too.

00:22.857 --> 00:23.722
I love you.
Mom!

00:23.724 --> 00:26.392
Woman: (over pa)
<i> and the basketball pep rally</i>
<i> is after lunch.</i>

00:26.394 --> 00:29.128
<i> Also, barry goldberg,</i>
<i> your mother loves you.</i>

00:29.130 --> 00:31.030
Beverly: <i> You didn't</i>
<i> say it with love.</i>

00:31.032 --> 00:33.532
<i> Barry, I love you.</i>
(laughter)

00:33.534 --> 00:34.933
I love you, boopie.

00:34.935 --> 00:35.601
I love you so much.

00:35.603 --> 00:39.271
Hey, you,
with the window open,
tell my baby I love him!

00:39.273 --> 00:42.007
Adam, if you need to make,
call me!

00:42.009 --> 00:42.608
I'll pick you up!

00:42.610 --> 00:46.278
Adult adam: <i> My father,</i>
<i> on the other hand,</i>
<i> was not nearly as effusive.</i>

00:46.280 --> 00:48.047
Why you got to be a moron
all the time?

00:48.049 --> 00:50.516
Don't be a moron.
Get your ass home.

00:50.518 --> 00:51.050
You're a moron.

00:51.052 --> 00:53.252
Adult adam: <i> Oh, yeah, my dad</i>
<i> was miles from sentimental.</i>

00:53.254 --> 00:56.388
Okay,
I'm heading off to prom.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.923
Erica, wait.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.658
Can you, uh,
get me the remote?

00:59.660 --> 01:00.426
<i> And no matter what we did,</i>

01:00.428 --> 01:05.030
<i> My dad was literally incapable</i>
<i> of saying "I love you."</i>

01:05.032 --> 01:08.267
Great pass, bobby!
I love you, son!

01:08.269 --> 01:09.468
Bar! Hey, bar!

01:09.470 --> 01:11.870
I want to beat
the traffic!

01:11.872 --> 01:13.172
Catch a ride home
with bobby!

01:13.174 --> 01:14.773
Adult adam:
<i> He couldn't even say</i>
<i> "I love you"</i>

01:14.775 --> 01:17.342
<i> When erica was accepted</i>
<i> into the governor's school,</i>

01:17.344 --> 01:19.078
<i> A prestigious</i>
<i> summer music program.</i>

01:19.080 --> 01:21.380
<i> But my mother</i>
<i> more than made up for it.</i>

01:21.382 --> 01:24.416
And I'm not saying
other people don't love
their children.

01:24.418 --> 01:30.556
I'm just saying I
love mine way more than
they love theirs.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.290
So, to sum it all up...

01:31.292 --> 01:34.560
(voice breaking)
mama hawk's gonna
miss baby bird.

01:34.562 --> 01:37.896
Here, I bought you
a going-away present.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.832
I'm sure you'll look at it
every night.

01:39.834 --> 01:42.935
Oh, good. A photo album.
(chuckles)

01:42.937 --> 01:44.937
Not the leather jacket
or boots I wanted.

01:44.939 --> 01:48.674
And now your father
would like to say a few
heartfelt words.

01:48.676 --> 01:49.942
Uh, no, no, no,
I'm good.

01:49.944 --> 01:53.245
Your, uh, 20-minute speech
covered all the bases.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.246
(glass clinking)
barry: Speech!

01:54.248 --> 01:55.581
Tell your daughter
how you feel.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.150
This is gonna be
so uncomfortable.
Mmm.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.785
Speech! Speech!

01:59.787 --> 02:03.188
Shut up, barry!
Take the knife
away from him.

02:03.190 --> 02:07.059
Erica, you're, uh,
my first kid.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.328
Uh,
could have been worse.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.930
What he meant to say
was that he loves you
so much, baby.

02:11.932 --> 02:15.300
(chuckles)
adult adam: <i> But then my dad</i>
<i> really opened his heart.</i>

02:15.302 --> 02:16.635
Sure.

02:16.637 --> 02:16.969
Wow.

02:16.971 --> 02:20.572
Adult adam: <i> Yeah, for him,</i>
<i> that's as open as it gets.</i>

02:20.840 --> 02:22.007
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:22.009 --> 02:26.912
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:28.281 --> 02:29.214
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:29.216 --> 02:33.385
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:33.387 --> 02:35.621
Adult adam: <i> It was may 13,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:35.623 --> 02:38.590
<i> The day I'd finally profess</i>
<i> my love for my girlfriend,</i>

02:38.592 --> 02:39.758
<i> And nothing would stop me.</i>

02:39.760 --> 02:41.426
What the hell, dude?
Those aren't for you.

02:41.428 --> 02:44.830
Hey, don't leave a basketball
in front of michael jordan

02:44.832 --> 02:46.899
And expect him
not to dunk it.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.767
From downtown!

02:49.102 --> 02:51.637
Idiot.
Can't you read?

02:51.639 --> 02:52.838
These are for dana.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.540
I'm finally gonna tell her
I love her.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.974
What?
Isn't it great?

02:55.976 --> 02:59.077
He's telling his girl
he loves her with baked goods.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.213
You can't tell a girl
you love her.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.848
It ruins everything.
Trust me.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.649
Please don't trust him.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.918
Love is dangerous,
and it can hurt people,

03:05.920 --> 03:09.121
Like a ninja riding
on a saber-toothed tiger.

03:09.123 --> 03:09.922
Please don't trust him.

03:09.924 --> 03:12.591
You can't just say it.
It makes you look vulnerable.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.892
And she'll lose
all respect for you.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.295
Well, I got to
do something.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.697
Dana and her family
are going away
for the summer.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.432
What if she meets a guy
while she's in seattle?

03:20.434 --> 03:23.001
Why are you worried
about some dude from canada?

03:23.003 --> 03:26.138
You just need to relax
and maintain the upper hand.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.940
(sighs) I just...

03:27.942 --> 03:28.607
Don't want to lose her.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.076
So this is what you do,
you March up to dana.

03:31.078 --> 03:34.112
You gently cup her beautiful
face in your hands,

03:34.114 --> 03:37.616
Look deep into her brown eyes,
and attack her one weakness,

03:37.618 --> 03:39.952
Like, "you got
gremlin ears, girl."

03:39.954 --> 03:41.587
Don't do that.
Do that!

03:41.589 --> 03:42.421
Don't do that.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.156
Do that!
It's your only choice!

03:44.158 --> 03:46.158
Give me these cupcakes.
No!

03:46.160 --> 03:46.925
Oh, god!
What?

03:46.927 --> 03:48.660
Adult adam: <i> Barry was a man</i>
<i> of strong convictions.</i>

03:48.662 --> 03:51.496
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> he was never one to follow</i>
<i> his own advice.</i>

03:51.498 --> 03:53.298
What do you mean,
you got practice until 5:00?

03:53.300 --> 03:56.401
You promised your man
you'd watch him do leg curls.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.537
I really didn't,
but I will drop by after.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.772
I'll bring you one of those
frozen burritos you like.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.809
God, you so get me.
I love you.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.144
Adult adam: <i> And in a moment</i>
<i> of sheer stupidity,</i>

04:06.146 --> 04:08.480
<i> Barry had accidently dropped</i>
<i> the "l" bomb.</i>

04:08.482 --> 04:11.450
<i> His only hope was</i>
<i> that lainey didn't hear him.</i>

04:11.452 --> 04:14.019
What did you just say?
Adult adam: <i> But she did.</i>

04:14.021 --> 04:15.454
I said...

04:15.456 --> 04:17.889
You got gremlin ears,
girl.

04:19.359 --> 04:21.193
Barry norman goldberg
with the save.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.762
Adult adam:
<i> While barry was denying</i>
<i> he said the "l" word,</i>

04:23.764 --> 04:26.098
<i> My mom was livid</i>
<i> that my dad couldn't.</i>

04:26.100 --> 04:28.634
Okay.
You're rage-cleaning.

04:28.636 --> 04:32.604
Before you wipe a hole
in the counter,
tell me what I did.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.606
Why can't you just tell
the kids you love them?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.708
You tell them
100 times a day.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.210
How much love
do these people need?

04:38.212 --> 04:41.313
I only say it so much
to pick up your slack.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.314
Why do I got to say it
out loud?

04:42.316 --> 04:45.951
I love bacon, but I never
actually say it.
Bacon just knows.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.753
You always say
you love bacon.

04:47.755 --> 04:48.887
Well, that is true.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.723
But I tell the kids
I love them every day

04:51.725 --> 04:52.924
By putting a roof
over their heads.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.228
Yeah?
Well, what gonna happen when
erica leaves for the summer?

04:56.230 --> 04:58.897
Where's your fancy
love roof then?

04:58.899 --> 05:02.000
Well,
you've got a point.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.935
Okay, bevy,
I'll go do my thing.

05:03.937 --> 05:07.673
Adult adam: <i> And that thing</i>
<i> was to go sit right</i>
<i> in his chair...</i>

05:07.675 --> 05:09.074
Nope.
<i> ...And ignore my mom.</i>

05:09.076 --> 05:11.176
You really should go tell
your daughter you love her.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.145
You weren't in the room.
How do you even know this?

05:13.147 --> 05:15.113
You basically yell
everything you say.

05:15.115 --> 05:18.817
And for the record,
I completely agree
with beverly.

05:18.819 --> 05:19.851
I'm not saying
"I love you."

05:19.853 --> 05:23.188
My dad never said it to me,
and I turned out fine.

05:23.190 --> 05:23.989
No, you're the best.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.590
Why are you busting
my chops?

05:25.592 --> 05:26.792
"I love you"
isn't something a dad says.

05:26.794 --> 05:30.529
Here. Watch me.
What are you doing?
Why are you moving in on me?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.097
I love you, mur.
Oh.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.465
I love you, mur.
Oh.

05:33.467 --> 05:36.101
I love you,
murray goldberg.

05:36.103 --> 05:36.902
This is a nightmare.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.438
Adult adam: <i> While my dad</i>
<i> was being forced to say</i>
<i> "I love you,"</i>

05:39.440 --> 05:42.074
<i> I was ready to open up</i>
<i> my heart to dana.</i>

05:42.076 --> 05:43.775
<i> Long before texting,</i>
<i> the only way</i>

05:43.777 --> 05:45.777
<i> To profess your deepest</i>
<i> feelings for a girl</i>

05:45.779 --> 05:46.645
<i> Was to pen an epic love letter</i>

05:46.647 --> 05:49.948
<i> And cooly hand-deliver it</i>
<i> into her locker.</i>

05:49.950 --> 05:52.150
Will you just stop?
You've been dodging me
for two days.

05:52.152 --> 05:55.587
It's only been two days?
Feels like I've been dodging
you for a week.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.422
Oh! Why did you have to
say "I love you"?

05:57.424 --> 05:59.491
It's no big deal.
I say it all the time.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.693
Watch.
I love you, dan!

06:01.695 --> 06:03.495
Oh, love you, too, bro.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.130
See? Means nothing.

06:05.132 --> 06:05.464
Hey!

06:05.466 --> 06:08.100
Okay, if anything,
you need to stop
reading into things.

06:08.102 --> 06:11.303
It's not like I said
"I love you more than
anything in the world"

06:11.305 --> 06:13.538
Or that you're my moon
and my sun

06:13.540 --> 06:15.006
And "if you want to
get married right now,

06:15.008 --> 06:16.908
"I'd run away and never
see my family again."

06:16.910 --> 06:20.679
I never said any of those
things, so get over yourself.

06:20.681 --> 06:21.713
I have practice, okay?
I got to go.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.082
<i> Barry was right.</i>
<i> Saying "I love you"</i>
<i> ruined everything.</i>

06:24.084 --> 06:28.286
(school bell rings)
<i> lucky for me, I wrote it down</i>
<i> and could easily take it back.</i>

06:28.288 --> 06:29.688
<i> Or so I thought.</i>

06:29.690 --> 06:31.890
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

06:31.892 --> 06:32.958
There you are.
Aah!

06:32.960 --> 06:35.127
Third-period bell
just rang.
Then you should go.

06:35.129 --> 06:37.162
But I got to get
my homework.
(thud)

06:37.164 --> 06:38.797
It's more important
to be on time

06:38.799 --> 06:40.432
Than to have your homework,
am I right?

06:40.434 --> 06:41.233
Move it, move it.
No...

06:41.235 --> 06:43.668
Adult adam: <i> While I was trying</i>
<i> to keep dana from knowing I</i>
<i> loved her,</i>

06:43.670 --> 06:46.938
<i> My dad went to erica</i>
<i> to finally say it.</i>

06:46.940 --> 06:48.907
Hey.
Hey?

06:48.909 --> 06:51.276
You, uh, seem surprised
to see me here.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.979
Well, you usually
don't make it this far
down the hallway.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.248
Yeah, well, it's really not
on the way to anything.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.650
So, what do you want?
(scoffs)

06:59.552 --> 07:01.319
I, um...

07:02.822 --> 07:05.190
Was just thinking that,
um, you know,

07:05.192 --> 07:08.560
You're going away
for the summer and all,
and...

07:08.562 --> 07:12.364
You know,
I don't really say it much.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.532
I, um...

07:13.534 --> 07:14.466
What's happening?

07:14.468 --> 07:16.935
You know,
I just wanted to say...

07:16.937 --> 07:18.470
I love you.
What?

07:18.472 --> 07:20.305
(mumbling) I love you.
What?

07:20.307 --> 07:21.440
(mumbling) I love you.

07:21.442 --> 07:22.441
What?
You heard me.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.443
I really didn't.
(scoffs)

07:24.445 --> 07:28.079
I'm just saying...
Oh, god.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.148
...That I, uh...

07:30.416 --> 07:32.117
Love you.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.319
Are you sick or something?
No.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.387
Did you gamble away
my college fund?

07:35.389 --> 07:36.855
That's nuts.
Where did you get that from?

07:36.857 --> 07:39.157
Well, I know you and mom
aren't getting divorced

07:39.159 --> 07:40.959
Because your survival
depends on her.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.128
So what is this?
You're freaking me out.

07:43.130 --> 07:43.829
It's nothing, damn it!

07:43.831 --> 07:45.897
I just wanted to say
"I love you"!

07:45.899 --> 07:47.833
Okay. Um...

07:47.835 --> 07:49.234
Thanks?

07:50.570 --> 07:53.205
So, that's it, huh?
Is that it?

07:53.207 --> 07:54.172
Okay, all right.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.875
So I guess I'll,
I'll be on my way.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.744
(sighs)

08:01.914 --> 08:03.415
Well, I said the thing
to the girl.

08:03.417 --> 08:04.983
We can all get on
with our lives.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.285
(gasps) oh, come on.
I want details.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.353
She didn't say it back.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.288
They always say it back.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.356
Not in this case.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.257
Maybe you didn't
say it right.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.460
I want a do-over, murray.
Go back up and try again.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.595
No do-overs!

08:16.597 --> 08:17.929
I'm never saying
those words again.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.665
Don't say that just 'cause
your feelings are hurt.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.399
My feelings aren't hurt.

08:21.401 --> 08:24.236
I just discovered
that I'm not my
daughter's cup of tea.

08:24.238 --> 08:27.372
That would honestly
rock me to the core.

08:27.374 --> 08:28.640
Yeah, well, you know.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.442
I mean that's
a rejection of you

08:30.444 --> 08:33.778
Both as a father
and a human being.

08:33.780 --> 08:34.212
It's fine.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.648
You'd think she'd say it
just to be polite.

08:36.650 --> 08:40.785
Okay, it stings a little.
This is your fault.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.187
You set me up.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.255
Well...

08:43.257 --> 08:47.659
That was my first and last
"I love you" ever!

08:47.827 --> 08:50.562
Adult adam:
<i> It was third period,</i>
<i> and I was running out of time</i>

08:50.564 --> 08:52.731
<i> To rescue my love letter</i>
<i> from dana's locker.</i>

08:52.733 --> 08:55.901
Damn it!
What am I even listening for?

08:55.903 --> 08:56.568
The movies lied.

08:56.570 --> 09:00.539
Adult adam: <i> Out of options,</i>
<i> there was only one logical</i>
<i> choice left...</i>

09:00.541 --> 09:01.940
<i> Pull the fire alarm.</i>

09:01.942 --> 09:03.241
<i> Sure, it was a serious crime.</i>

09:03.243 --> 09:06.144
<i> But as long as</i>
<i> I played it cool</i>
<i> and acted quick,</i>

09:06.146 --> 09:09.881
<i> No one would be the wiser.</i>

09:09.883 --> 09:11.082
Goldfarb!

09:11.084 --> 09:13.084
My office! Now!

09:13.553 --> 09:15.020
<i> Son, I've been here</i>
<i> a long time,</i>

09:15.022 --> 09:16.855
And I've seen a lot of kids
pull that fire alarm

09:16.857 --> 09:19.124
For a lot
of different reasons.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.091
What's yours?

09:20.093 --> 09:21.693
Pop quiz in chemistry?
No.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.161
Arousing daydream?
No!

09:23.163 --> 09:25.564
Had a fart that
fooled you?
Worse.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.164
Ooh. I'm intrigued.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.734
I have an awesome girlfriend,
and I wrote her a letter...

09:29.736 --> 09:32.170
Ka-boom.
The problem is

09:32.172 --> 09:35.106
I stupidly signed the letter
"I love you," and now...

09:35.108 --> 09:37.909
Now you're out on a ledge,
exposed,

09:37.911 --> 09:39.511
With a giant target
on your heart.

09:39.513 --> 09:42.981
There are no more dangerous
words than "I love you."

09:42.983 --> 09:43.648
Wow. Yeah.

09:43.650 --> 09:46.451
Just 'cause I wear
the same tiny shorts
every day

09:46.453 --> 09:49.020
Doesn't mean
I don't wear many hats.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.322
Coach knows love good.

09:50.324 --> 09:53.358
I even played
the russian
mail-order game,

09:53.360 --> 09:54.893
And I did not win.

09:54.895 --> 09:58.296
Let's just say...
"woo! Woo!"

09:58.298 --> 10:00.231
It was an express
to sad town.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.634
Coach! Coach!
I need your help.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.070
What are you doing?
He's helping me right now.

10:05.072 --> 10:08.473
Go away! I actually got
real adult problems.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.874
I want to
be a cheerleader.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.476
We've all been there.
Why?

10:11.478 --> 10:13.945
My lady.
She's been pushing me away.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.147
But you know the saying,
if you love someone,

10:16.149 --> 10:19.718
You become a male cheerleader
and trap them into loving you.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.554
Dang.
You goldberg's feel hard.

10:22.556 --> 10:25.657
You leave it
all on the field,
just like coach.

10:25.659 --> 10:28.059
Well, don't worry.
I can help you both.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.828
You can help me
get my letter back?
You got it.

10:29.830 --> 10:33.632
And I can be
a cheerleading man?
Oh, no. No, god, no.

10:33.634 --> 10:38.770
I got one position open,
if you got the nards.

10:38.772 --> 10:42.040
I'm looking for a brave soul
to be the team mascot.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.541
Well, my soul's
the bravest, coach.

10:43.543 --> 10:46.578
Adult adam: <i> While barry</i>
<i> would do anything to stay</i>
<i> close to lainey,</i>

10:46.580 --> 10:51.416
<i> My mom was furious</i>
<i> with erica for pushing</i>
<i> my dad away.</i>

10:51.418 --> 10:52.851
Mom,
stop rage-juicing.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.286
If you want to talk,
I'm right here.

10:55.288 --> 10:55.920
How could you?

10:55.922 --> 10:58.156
I've done some questionable
things lately,

10:58.158 --> 11:01.026
So if you could just say
out loud what I did first,

11:01.028 --> 11:02.227
Just so we're all
on the same page.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.996
Your father said
"I love you," and you
didn't say it back.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.400
Yes. That is definitely
the worst thing I've done
this week.

11:08.402 --> 11:09.634
Why can't you just say it
back to him?

11:09.636 --> 11:11.336
You have no problem saying
"I love you" to me.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.673
That's because you say it
so much, it's meaningless.

11:14.675 --> 11:15.373
I'm on autopilot.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.543
It's like saying
"god bless you"
after someone sneezes.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.378
It was a disaster
when he said it,

11:20.380 --> 11:22.681
And I'm not
gonna make it worse.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.683
What if I make it
worth your while?

11:24.685 --> 11:25.583
Wait, are you
trying to bribe me?

11:25.585 --> 11:28.553
(scoffs) please,
you wouldn't believe
what it would take

11:28.555 --> 11:30.488
To get me to do this.
Oh.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.556
I'm not saying no.

11:31.558 --> 11:34.893
I'm just saying come in high
with your offer.

11:39.765 --> 11:40.965
Is that a new jacket?

11:40.967 --> 11:42.200
It is. I love you, dad.

11:42.202 --> 11:47.372
Adult adam: <i> Turns out</i>
<i> the price of love</i>
<i> is $57 plus tax.</i>

11:47.374 --> 11:49.507
Oh, god!
She's opening up her locker!

11:49.509 --> 11:51.810
Quick, pull the fire alarm.
Come on, goldberg.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.946
Pulling the fire alarm
is morally reprehensible.

11:54.948 --> 11:58.183
<i> All right, people,</i>
<i> impromptu drug search!</i>

11:58.185 --> 12:00.518
<i> Open your lockers!</i>

12:00.520 --> 12:01.753
Think we'll start
over here.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.755
I'm searching your locker,
caldwell.

12:03.757 --> 12:04.923
Me? Why?

12:04.925 --> 12:06.691
Well, let's just say
I got it on good authority

12:06.693 --> 12:08.660
There's a butt-load of ludes
in there.

12:08.662 --> 12:10.595
What's a lude?
Don't play coy with me.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.164
I know a lude-head
when I see one.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.766
All right,
let's see here.

12:14.768 --> 12:17.635
Okay, search is over,
people!

12:17.637 --> 12:20.739
<i> Let's go!</i>
<i> Asses to classes!</i>

12:20.741 --> 12:21.673
Stay clean, caldwell.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.241
Adult adam:
<i> Even though coach mellor</i>
<i> saved me</i>

12:23.243 --> 12:25.443
<i> From making the biggest</i>
<i> mistake of my life,</i>

12:25.445 --> 12:30.215
<i> Nothing could save barry</i>
<i> from this debacle.</i>

12:30.217 --> 12:33.551
<i> While my brother</i>
<i> considered himself</i>
<i> an expert at many things,</i>

12:33.553 --> 12:38.289
<i> The fine art of mascot-ing</i>
<i> was not one of them.</i>

12:38.291 --> 12:39.257
<i> Turns out</i>
<i> the only thing creepier</i>

12:39.259 --> 12:40.725
<i> Than barry spying</i>
<i> on his girlfriend</i>

12:40.727 --> 12:44.896
<i> Was the 10-pound,</i>
<i> dead-eyed, grinning quaker</i>
<i> strapped to his head.</i>

12:44.898 --> 12:48.700
Hey! What are you...
Back off!

12:49.468 --> 12:51.202
Barry: Chill!

12:51.204 --> 12:53.705
Surprise!
It's barry!

12:53.707 --> 12:56.241
Oh, my god.
What are you doing?

12:56.243 --> 12:57.509
I'm the fighting quaker!

12:57.511 --> 13:00.211
I thought dressing in a giant,
rubber donald sutherland head

13:00.213 --> 13:03.114
Would be the perfect way
of making things
less weird between us.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.717
This makes things
so much weirder.

13:05.719 --> 13:06.451
Please, just go.

13:06.453 --> 13:10.255
Only if you say
"I love you" back so
it makes things even.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.689
Go on.

13:11.691 --> 13:12.524
(muffled) tell me you love me.

13:12.526 --> 13:15.460
My eyes are in my mouth,
so say it right here.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.630
I'm sorry, barry.
I'm not gonna say it.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.565
Ouch.
She doesn't love you, bro.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.333
(bleep) off,
lyle and kyle.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.067
Whoa!
Easy!

13:23.069 --> 13:25.236
I will throw you, bro,
and not in
a cheerleading way.

13:25.238 --> 13:28.239
(whistle blows)
all right, bring it in!

13:28.241 --> 13:30.141
Cheerleaders and mascot, too.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.478
Big away game
at central high tonight.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.313
Heated rivalry, big stakes.

13:35.315 --> 13:39.083
That means some of you
are going to get hurt.

13:39.085 --> 13:41.686
Sprained ankles,
jammed fingers,

13:41.688 --> 13:44.622
Not to mention guaranteed
off-the-court attacks

13:44.624 --> 13:46.224
On some of our
support personnel.

13:46.226 --> 13:47.358
I'm sorry. What, now?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.294
I thought you knew
about this.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.596
Last year, some of our
more passionate fans

13:51.598 --> 13:54.065
Laid a swift beat down
on their mascot,

13:54.067 --> 13:54.766
Bobby the beaver.

13:54.768 --> 13:59.504
Tonight, revenge hangs
like a thick fog over
the entire squad,

13:59.506 --> 14:02.774
Although some of us might
be wearing cumbersome,

14:02.776 --> 14:03.541
Vision-hindering costumes,

14:03.543 --> 14:08.246
Which will make us
even more of a target
than the others.

14:08.881 --> 14:10.248
Uh, coach?

14:10.250 --> 14:13.218
Yes? Our brave,
doomed quaker
has a question.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.954
I know you're giving us
a general pep talk and all,

14:15.956 --> 14:17.522
But it feels directed
mostly toward me.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.958
Oh, my god, barry.
Take off the stupid costume.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.626
They're gonna break
every bone in your body.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.795
My heart bone's already
been broken, girl.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.129
Miller: That's the spirit.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.798
Give barry a hug
before you go.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.101
It may be some time
before you get a chance
to do it again.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.370
Not a good time, dan.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.407
Adult adam: <i> Even though</i>
<i> my mom bribed erica</i>
<i> to say "I love you,"</i>

14:36.409 --> 14:39.811
<i> She was so giddy with the</i>
<i> results that she doubled down.</i>

14:39.813 --> 14:41.412
Dad! There's my guy!

14:41.414 --> 14:44.115
Just wanted to say
I love you.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.017
I love you so much.

14:46.019 --> 14:46.784
She really does.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.052
What the hell's going on
with you two?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.754
Nothing.
I just love you, man.

14:49.756 --> 14:53.091
Did you put her up to this?
First the jacket,

14:53.093 --> 14:53.958
Now new boots?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.727
Are you buying her
leather goods

14:55.729 --> 14:58.229
So she'll say "I love you"
to me?

14:58.231 --> 14:59.297
(laughs)

14:59.299 --> 15:00.965
(singsong voice)
guilty!

15:00.967 --> 15:03.134
(laughing)
come on.

15:03.769 --> 15:04.502
I am guilty. Yes.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.538
Stop pulling strings, dad!
I love you. Just drop it.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.374
Well,
I don't accept it.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.276
What?
You can't reject my love.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.679
Oh, I reject it.
I reject it but good.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.381
Take it.
Take the "I love you."

15:16.383 --> 15:19.484
Just take it, murray.
It's love. Take it.

15:19.486 --> 15:22.654
No.
She's using it as a weapon.

15:22.656 --> 15:23.554
I love you!

15:23.556 --> 15:25.590
(gasps)
see? It stings doesn't it?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.059
Oh, you want it
to sting?

15:28.061 --> 15:29.994
I love you!
Take that.

15:29.996 --> 15:32.196
Is that all you got?
I love you!

15:32.198 --> 15:33.331
I love you so much!
Eat it!

15:33.333 --> 15:35.166
I love you more!
Boom! In your face!

15:35.168 --> 15:36.901
Shut your mouth,
'cause I love you more!

15:36.903 --> 15:39.437
I love you to infinity!
I love you!

15:39.439 --> 15:43.942
My love knows no bounds
all the way to infinity!

15:43.944 --> 15:44.742
Aah!
Aah!

15:44.744 --> 15:47.912
Adult adam:
<i> While my dad and erica</i>
<i> were using love as a weapon,</i>

15:47.914 --> 15:50.315
<i> My brother was</i>
<i> at our rival high school</i>

15:50.317 --> 15:51.449
<i> With a target on his back.</i>

15:51.451 --> 15:54.319
<i> The fighting quaker</i>
<i> didn't have a fighting chance.</i>

15:54.321 --> 15:55.687
(all chanting)
kill the quaker!

15:55.689 --> 15:57.522
(rhythmic clapping)
all: Kill the quaker!

15:57.524 --> 15:58.790
Oh, my god!
Barry, that's you!

15:58.792 --> 15:59.958
You're the one
they're gonna kill.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.093
Dude, just hide on the bus.
That's what I do.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.828
Adult adam: <i> A sane man</i>
<i> would have listened,</i>

16:03.830 --> 16:06.030
<i> But my bro was anything</i>
<i> but sane.</i>

16:06.032 --> 16:07.966
No! No hiding!

16:07.968 --> 16:09.033
I'm gonna go out there!

16:09.035 --> 16:11.569
It's the least I can do
after you all took me

16:11.571 --> 16:13.404
Into your cheerleading family,

16:13.406 --> 16:15.173
Especially you, lyle.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.041
Not you, kyle. You suck.

16:17.043 --> 16:20.278
Point is, it's been
quite a ride, cheerleaders,

16:20.280 --> 16:22.547
But the ride ends now.

16:22.549 --> 16:25.450
Barry, wait.
Barry, don't do this.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.517
Why do you even care?

16:26.519 --> 16:27.618
Because I love you, okay?
God.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.121
You're just saying that
'cause you don't want me
to die.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.190
Of course I don't want you
to die.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.994
But...
I really do love you.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.964
Then why didn't you
say it back?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.266
I was scared, okay?

16:42.268 --> 16:44.769
When my mom left,
it crushed my dad,

16:44.771 --> 16:48.940
So I swore
I'd never be so dumb
to fall in love myself.

16:48.942 --> 16:51.109
But...
You're just so dumb,

16:51.111 --> 16:54.412
You made me fall in love
with you anyway.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.548
So...
You really love me?

17:02.054 --> 17:04.188
Wait, you're still
going out there?

17:04.190 --> 17:05.023
You bet I am.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.158
I'm as strong
as all the oceans,

17:07.160 --> 17:09.627
As powerful
as a really big magnet.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.462
As awesome
as a thunder cat!

17:11.464 --> 17:16.634
Because lainey lewis
loves barry goldberg!

17:16.969 --> 17:21.072
Adult adam: <i> It was a moment</i>
<i> my brother would</i>
<i> hold onto forever.</i>

17:21.074 --> 17:22.507
<i> The girl of his dreams</i>
<i> loved him back,</i>

17:22.509 --> 17:25.109
<i> And nothing could</i>
<i> hurt him now.</i>

17:25.111 --> 17:29.347
<i> Well, nothing except</i>
<i> a vengeful mob of angry fans.</i>

17:30.015 --> 17:32.884
<i> But as I watched my brother</i>
<i> single-handedly battle</i>

17:32.886 --> 17:34.519
<i> An entire high school,</i>
<i> I realized</i>

17:34.521 --> 17:38.389
<i> That with love on your side,</i>
<i> you can take on anything.</i>

17:38.391 --> 17:40.892
<i> Sure, there's nothing</i>
<i> more dangerous or scary</i>

17:40.894 --> 17:43.027
<i> Than putting your heart</i>
<i> on the line.</i>

17:43.029 --> 17:44.629
<i> But as I raced into the night,</i>

17:44.631 --> 17:49.233
<i> I knew that love</i>
<i> was a risk worth taking.</i>

17:51.236 --> 17:52.603
Adam.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.472
Dana. I...

17:54.474 --> 17:57.642
What? What's wrong?
(paper crinkles)

17:57.743 --> 17:59.110
I wrote you
this whole thing

17:59.112 --> 18:02.580
'cause I was so scared
to say it out loud.

18:02.948 --> 18:05.216
I'm not scared anymore.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.885
Dana, I love you.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.555
I love you.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.823
I...

18:12.858 --> 18:14.659
...Love you, too.

18:15.461 --> 18:18.329
And that's what makes
all this so hard.

18:18.331 --> 18:21.933
I just...Didn't know
how to tell you.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.668
Tell me what?

18:23.670 --> 18:27.638
We're not going to seattle
just for the summer.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.109
My dad got offered
a job there, so...

18:31.111 --> 18:33.678
We're gonna see
if we like it.

18:34.913 --> 18:37.248
But you can't
just leave.

18:37.382 --> 18:38.783
Here.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.520
My green lantern ring?

18:44.089 --> 18:46.757
Hopefully, I'm there
on the first day of school

18:46.759 --> 18:49.193
And you can
give it back to me.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.298
(kisses)

18:54.633 --> 18:56.634
Goodbye, adam.

18:57.035 --> 18:58.736
Adult adam: <i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about young love.</i>

18:58.738 --> 19:02.907
<i> As magical as it is,</i>
<i> it's just as unpredictable.</i>

19:04.076 --> 19:06.077
Doing some
rage-packing, huh?

19:06.079 --> 19:07.578
Well, wonder
where I get it from.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.914
Shmoopie, I can't let you
leave things this way

19:09.916 --> 19:10.681
With your father.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.451
(scoffs) we were totally fine
before you broke us.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.952
No, I get it now.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.821
Just 'cause I say
"I love you" all the time

19:16.823 --> 19:19.290
Doesn't mean you have to.
I just...

19:19.292 --> 19:22.093
Wanted both of you
to know how you feel
about each other.

19:22.095 --> 19:25.830
He's my dad.
I love him
more than anything.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.231
Trust me, he knows.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.499
Adult adam: <i> And she was right.</i>
<i> He really did.</i>

19:28.501 --> 19:33.504
<i> Even though erica and my dad</i>
<i> were never able to</i>
<i> actually say the words,</i>

19:33.506 --> 19:35.039
<i> They didn't have to.</i>

19:35.041 --> 19:36.474
<i> Because when it comes</i>
<i> to family,</i>

19:36.476 --> 19:38.075
<i> You know in your heart</i>
<i> how they feel...</i>

19:38.077 --> 19:39.277
I love you, I love you,
I love you.

19:39.279 --> 19:43.648
Adult adam: <i> And you carry</i>
<i> that love with you</i>
<i> no matter how far you go.</i>

19:43.650 --> 19:46.017
So...
So...

19:46.019 --> 19:49.253
Uh, have a nice summer,
peanut.

19:50.255 --> 19:51.989
And, uh...

19:53.492 --> 19:55.960
I know, dad. Me too.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.433
You okay?

20:03.235 --> 20:04.769
Okay, come on. I'm sorry.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.971
Adult adam: <i> Looking back</i>
<i> on your childhood</i>
<i> is a funny thing.</i>

20:06.973 --> 20:10.708
<i> Sure, the details get fuzzy,</i>
<i> and the days blend together.</i>

20:10.710 --> 20:13.044
<i> But the good news is</i>
<i> all the hurt fades away,</i>

20:13.046 --> 20:14.879
<i> And you just end up</i>
<i> remembering the love.</i>

20:14.881 --> 20:20.618
<i> You remember your family.</i>
<i> You remember 1980-something.</i>

20:20.719 --> 20:23.487
<i> And you wouldn't</i>
<i> change a thing.</i>

20:23.489 --> 20:27.325
<i> Our family's here.</i>
<i> Ha! Come on</i>
<i> and see our family.</i>

20:27.327 --> 20:28.659
I love you.
Oh, geez.

20:28.661 --> 20:29.894
I love you. (laughs)

20:29.896 --> 20:31.629
I love you. I love you.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.864
(all shouting)

20:35.267 --> 20:38.135
Fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight!

20:38.137 --> 20:38.603
<i> Yeah!</i>

20:38.605 --> 20:44.809
Adam: <i> We gather here today</i>
<i> to witness the burial of</i>
<i> optimus prime.</i>

20:57.322 --> 20:59.257
(upbeat music plays)

21:13.605 --> 21:15.072
Al: Yeah, kiddo!

21:15.074 --> 21:16.941
Barry,
that was amazing.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.210
What's up?
Who's this?

21:19.212 --> 21:21.045
We assumed it was you.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.180
(music continues)
