WEBVTT

00:04.613 --> 00:06.280
Honey?

00:06.281 --> 00:09.050
We just got the first guitar
in from our new supplier.

00:09.051 --> 00:11.130
It only cost us 10 bucks.

00:11.131 --> 00:13.154
How do they make a
guitar so cheap?

00:13.155 --> 00:16.274
They don't... you do.

00:18.055 --> 00:21.895
The instructions
are right there.

00:24.235 --> 00:26.711
- They're in Korean.
- Good luck!

00:26.712 --> 00:29.592
Or I should say...

00:33.419 --> 00:36.297
Guess who got a job
at Puffy's Pillows?

00:36.298 --> 00:38.878
Best job ever.

00:38.932 --> 00:42.995
Wow! I've never seen you so
excited about a job before.

00:42.996 --> 00:46.831
I demonstrate how comfy the pillows
are by sleeping on them all day.

00:46.832 --> 00:51.669
It's my dream job... I
literally get paid to dream.

00:51.670 --> 00:54.298
Hey, guys, great news!

00:54.299 --> 00:56.808
Starr Records is going to
produce our next music video.

00:56.809 --> 00:58.030
Woo!

00:58.031 --> 01:00.519
- And I'm directing it.
- Way to go!

01:00.520 --> 01:03.681
I thought Jimmy Starr only worked
with big-name video directors.

01:03.682 --> 01:05.417
How'd you convince
him to hire you?

01:05.418 --> 01:07.819
Dez pitched him this amazing
concept for the video.

01:07.820 --> 01:09.429
It's about first love.

01:09.430 --> 01:13.253
I'm going to set it in an Amusement
Park, because love is like a ride...

01:13.254 --> 01:19.154
It's exciting, scary and dizzying, and
in the end, you just want to throw up.

01:20.350 --> 01:22.101
You've never been
in love, have you?

01:22.102 --> 01:25.703
No, but I have thrown up a lot.

01:25.704 --> 01:28.130
Trish, can you get us
an Amusement Park?

01:28.131 --> 01:31.246
I think we need permits for that.
It could take forever.

01:31.247 --> 01:32.525
Oh.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.647
Maybe we wouldn't need
permits if we knew someone

01:35.648 --> 01:39.191
who could get a job
at an Amusement Park.

01:39.192 --> 01:42.957
Someone who gets new
jobs really easily.

01:42.958 --> 01:44.689
Mmm?

01:44.690 --> 01:47.692
Someone who seems to get
a new job every day.

01:47.693 --> 01:50.762
- I'm talking to you, Trish.
- Oh, come on!

01:50.763 --> 01:54.599
I'm getting paid to sleep. I've
never been better at a job.

01:54.600 --> 01:58.380
- Please, Trish!
- Pretty please!

01:59.472 --> 02:03.941
Fine. I'll get fired from Puffy's
Pillows, and get a job a Phil's Fun Town.

02:03.942 --> 02:05.374
Yes!

02:05.375 --> 02:09.532
I'll just sleep when Dez tells me
about his day, like I normally do.

02:09.533 --> 02:10.971
Thanks, Trish.

02:10.972 --> 02:13.312
Wait, what?

02:13.653 --> 02:16.470
Finished! That wasn't
as hard as I thought.

02:16.471 --> 02:20.191
Whoa! Cool guitar. Let me try.

02:23.233 --> 02:24.762
Oh.

02:24.763 --> 02:27.743
Maybe these weren't
extra screws.

02:27.744 --> 02:29.544
Eh!

Keep your hands and feet inside the
car, no throwing food at the top,

03:36.505 --> 03:42.343
no standing, no rocking, and
finally, are either of you pregnant?

03:42.344 --> 03:44.984
I have to ask.

03:46.315 --> 03:49.735
Enjoy the Wheel of Terror.

03:50.509 --> 03:51.904
Okay!

03:51.905 --> 03:55.423
We'll start shooting as soon as the actress
who plays Austin's girlfriend shows up.

03:55.424 --> 03:57.492
Man, how fun is Phil's Fun Town?

03:57.493 --> 04:00.728
I've spent the morning scraping
gum off the carousel horses.

04:00.729 --> 04:03.498
There's nothing fun about
this job, unicorn boy.

04:03.499 --> 04:05.599
Why would you call me unicorn...

04:05.600 --> 04:09.080
Oh, unicorn boy. I get it.

04:11.673 --> 04:14.342
Great idea making Ally
the wardrobe girl.

04:14.343 --> 04:16.641
Your clothes are all crooked.

04:16.642 --> 04:17.800
Hmm.

04:17.801 --> 04:19.414
Looked great in the
dressing-room mirror.

04:19.415 --> 04:22.550
All right, we're no longer using
the fun house as a dressing room.

04:22.551 --> 04:25.486
- Wardrobe!
- Coming!

04:25.487 --> 04:29.524
Fix Austin's clothes and ask the
makeup girl why his face is so shiny.

04:29.525 --> 04:31.150
We don't have a makeup girl.

04:31.151 --> 04:34.230
Oh. Okay, well, from now on,
you can be the makeup girl.

04:34.231 --> 04:37.711
Why is his face so shiny?!

04:41.643 --> 04:43.563
Whoa.

04:43.764 --> 04:46.164
Who's that?

04:50.434 --> 04:53.136
That's Kira. She's
playing your girlfriend.

04:53.137 --> 04:54.549
She's flawless.

04:54.550 --> 04:59.290
Hi, Austin, I'm Kira.
I'm such a huge fan.

04:59.521 --> 05:02.641
Hi, nice to meet you.

05:03.242 --> 05:06.008
Okay, she's got one flaw.
Her breath...

05:06.009 --> 05:07.989
Reeks!

05:08.136 --> 05:09.973
I'm sure it's not that bad.

05:09.974 --> 05:13.032
Okay, Kira, our first scene's
going to be on the Ferris Wheel.

05:13.033 --> 05:14.435
Ooh, how exciting!

05:14.436 --> 05:17.405
Ah! Yes! It is exciting.

05:17.406 --> 05:20.285
Our wardrobe girl Ally
will be right with you.

05:20.286 --> 05:23.981
Okay, it is that bad. Maybe
we should say something.

05:23.982 --> 05:26.680
You guys can't do that.
It'll hurt her feelings.

05:26.681 --> 05:30.983
She's hurting my nose's feelings.
Go talk to her. You'll see.

05:30.984 --> 05:33.588
Hey, Kira, I'm Ally,
the wardrobe girl.

05:33.589 --> 05:36.333
- Oh, is that for me?
- No!

05:36.334 --> 05:38.759
It's for me. My nose
is always cold.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.560
Ha!

05:41.945 --> 05:44.655
Okay, her breath is not
as fresh as it could be,

05:44.656 --> 05:47.350
but I still don't think
we should say anything.

05:47.351 --> 05:51.191
Austin, she looks great on camera
and it's only a two-day shoot.

05:51.192 --> 05:54.072
Just deal with it.

05:54.094 --> 05:56.377
Trish, we're ready to roll!

05:56.378 --> 05:59.517
Attention, the Wheel of
Terror ride is now closed.

05:59.518 --> 06:01.415
Please vacate the area.

06:01.416 --> 06:03.274
No fair!

06:03.275 --> 06:06.587
I've been waiting
here for an hour.

06:06.588 --> 06:10.008
You can't close the ride!

06:12.003 --> 06:14.346
Aw, now you're too short.

06:14.347 --> 06:16.784
You couldn't have gotten
on the ride anyway.

06:16.785 --> 06:20.485
Fine, but I want the face
of this sad child...

06:20.486 --> 06:23.486
Stuck in your brain.

06:24.273 --> 06:27.993
I'll file it with the others.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.480
Okay, guys, remember,
you're in love.

06:32.481 --> 06:36.797
So I want you nose to nose,
gazing into each other's eyes.

06:36.798 --> 06:39.878
Do we have to be nose to nose?
Can't we be back to back?

06:39.879 --> 06:43.359
No! That is not my vision.

06:43.458 --> 06:46.458
Trish, start her up.

06:46.461 --> 06:49.881
Enjoy the Wheel of Terror.

06:50.599 --> 06:52.140
And...

06:52.141 --> 06:53.915
Action!

06:53.916 --> 06:56.961
Okay, Trish, when it gets to the
top, I want you to slow it down

06:56.962 --> 06:59.574
so I can see their faces
as they come around.

06:59.575 --> 07:01.981
You can do that, can't you?

07:01.982 --> 07:07.142
I don't know, because
pulling a lever is so hard.

07:11.553 --> 07:13.112
Huh!

07:13.113 --> 07:16.593
It's harder than it looks.

07:16.617 --> 07:19.005
- Why did we stop?
- I don't know.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.895
But I hope it's not for long
because I'm scared of heights.

07:21.896 --> 07:24.682
Ah... we probably
shouldn't sit too close.

07:24.683 --> 07:26.634
If the car gets
imbalanced, we'll fall,

07:26.635 --> 07:29.537
and it'll be a horrible breath...
I mean death.

07:29.538 --> 07:31.940
Okay, now I'm really scared.

07:31.941 --> 07:35.343
You'll be fine. Just
take deep breaths.

07:35.344 --> 07:38.021
Okay, take small breaths,
really small breaths.

07:38.022 --> 07:40.137
What's the hold up down there?

07:40.138 --> 07:44.140
Trish is on the phone with maintenance.
I'm sure they'll be here any minute.

07:44.141 --> 07:45.439
More like any hour.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.598
The maintenance man is still fixing
the roller coaster I broke earlier.

07:48.599 --> 07:50.458
It's gonna be an hour.

07:50.459 --> 07:52.259
No!

07:52.284 --> 07:53.327
No!

07:53.328 --> 07:55.188
Yes!

07:55.213 --> 07:57.073
Yes!

08:00.901 --> 08:04.888
And then when I turned seven, my dad got
me a new cat to replace Mr. Whiskers.

08:04.889 --> 08:09.139
Sorry I'm babbling. Talking
helps to calm me down.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.054
Are you crying?

08:11.055 --> 08:13.103
That last story
really got to me.

08:13.104 --> 08:16.169
I can't imagine why Mr. Whiskers
would run away from you.

08:16.170 --> 08:19.495
I don't know either.
He had it so good.

08:19.496 --> 08:22.879
Every night, I would hold his little
face to mine and sing to him.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.692
- Do you want to hear the song?
- No! No no.

08:24.693 --> 08:26.471
<i>♪ Happy little kitty...</i>

08:26.472 --> 08:28.489
<i>♪ Ha ha ha.</i>

08:28.490 --> 08:30.566
<i>♪ Quiet little kitty...</i>

08:30.567 --> 08:33.447
<i>♪ Hush hush hush!.</i>

08:35.671 --> 08:39.390
Thank you, Mr. Maintenance Man.

08:39.614 --> 08:42.102
Oh oh! I'm out! Woo!

08:42.104 --> 08:45.104
Sweet, sweet freedom.

08:45.347 --> 08:48.482
Thank you so much for getting us down.
What can I do to repay you?

08:48.483 --> 08:50.403
Uh...

08:50.430 --> 08:55.410
Don't say another word
and we'll call it even.

08:56.425 --> 08:58.426
I can't go on any
more rides with Kira.

08:58.427 --> 09:00.695
Dez, you've got to
get a new girl!

09:00.696 --> 09:04.601
You can't, Dez. You don't understand
how fragile a girl's ego is.

09:04.602 --> 09:07.524
If you make her feel
insecure, she'll die inside.

09:07.525 --> 09:10.643
I think something
already died inside.

09:10.644 --> 09:12.796
I'm gonna get Kira ready
for the next scene,

09:12.797 --> 09:17.917
because I know you're going to do the
right thing and not replace her.

09:17.918 --> 09:20.303
Forget about her feelings.
I can't replace her

09:20.304 --> 09:24.080
because we're about to shoot the two
of you in the big hamster-ball ride.

09:24.081 --> 09:26.541
Hamster ball?

09:28.153 --> 09:29.412
Are you crazy?

09:29.413 --> 09:31.992
You want me in an
air-tight bubble with...

09:31.993 --> 09:33.432
Her?!

09:33.433 --> 09:34.475
Yes.

09:34.476 --> 09:37.427
The hamster ball represents
your own little world of love.

09:37.428 --> 09:39.363
It's like you share
the same heart...

09:39.364 --> 09:41.598
Breathe the same air.

09:41.599 --> 09:43.400
I don't want to
breathe the same air.

09:43.401 --> 09:46.370
I know you don't, but I love the passion.
Use that in the scene.

09:46.371 --> 09:48.711
Help! Help!

09:51.592 --> 09:55.479
Guys, the zipper broke! Ally's stuck
in the hamster ball with Kira.

09:55.480 --> 09:56.546
Hang on, Ally!

09:56.547 --> 09:58.587
Oh no!

09:58.716 --> 10:00.516
Ah!

10:02.620 --> 10:04.840
Oh! Help!

10:07.523 --> 10:10.460
Hey, maintenance guy!
Help again!

10:10.461 --> 10:12.801
Help! Help!

10:14.699 --> 10:17.819
Help help! Help help!

10:21.117 --> 10:23.507
I was wrong. You
gotta replace her.

10:23.508 --> 10:26.169
That's what I've been saying.
Dez, you've got to do this.

10:26.170 --> 10:29.035
All right, let me think. If we cast a
new girl before we shoot tomorrow.

10:29.036 --> 10:31.481
I can cut her on the stuff
we've already shot and...

10:31.482 --> 10:33.086
Kira, we need to talk.

10:33.087 --> 10:34.751
You don't need to
use the bullhorn.

10:34.752 --> 10:38.311
Well, I don't want to
talk to her up close.

10:38.312 --> 10:40.457
Here comes the head
of your record label.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.077
Jimmy's here?

10:42.078 --> 10:44.898
- Sweetie!
- Daddy!

10:46.089 --> 10:48.432
Jimmy is Kira's dad?

10:48.433 --> 10:50.354
Aw, man, you know
what that means?

10:50.355 --> 10:52.659
She'll have a ride home
after we fire her?

10:52.660 --> 10:56.268
No, it means we can't fire her.

10:56.269 --> 10:58.054
No!

10:58.055 --> 10:59.855
No!

11:00.039 --> 11:01.876
Yes!

11:01.877 --> 11:03.737
Yes!

11:12.997 --> 11:14.977
Jimmy!

11:15.967 --> 11:18.183
We didn't know Kira
was your daughter.

11:18.184 --> 11:20.629
I wanted her to get
the part on her own.

11:20.630 --> 11:25.600
Well, let me tell you, she
takes our breath away.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.469
I've always known
she was talented.

11:27.470 --> 11:29.838
Ever since she sang to that
cat before he ran away.

11:29.839 --> 11:32.119
Aw, daddy!

11:32.214 --> 11:34.965
How can you stand that?

11:34.966 --> 11:39.051
That we're keeping your
little angel away from you?

11:39.052 --> 11:40.731
We talk a lot on the phone.

11:40.732 --> 11:43.600
I wish we had that option.

11:43.601 --> 11:48.148
Listen, Dez, I'm taking a big chance
putting you in charge of this video.

11:48.149 --> 11:50.669
I expect great things.

11:50.670 --> 11:52.272
Show me around the set, Sweetie.

11:52.273 --> 11:53.395
Okay.

11:53.396 --> 11:55.661
Well, over here is the bottle toss.
If you look...

11:55.662 --> 11:59.322
I was talking to my daughter.

12:01.614 --> 12:04.313
What are we gonna do? The big
kissing scene is coming up.

12:04.314 --> 12:07.540
All we have to do is freshen
Kira's breath without her knowing.

12:07.541 --> 12:11.501
I agree, but you
gotta be subtle.

12:11.706 --> 12:14.935
Please! I know how to be subtle.

12:14.936 --> 12:18.776
Mints! Get your free mints here.

12:24.437 --> 12:26.826
Aw, man, none left for us.

12:26.827 --> 12:28.699
Lucky for you there's one left.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.040
I call it!

12:34.249 --> 12:37.215
Here, Kira, I got
you a corn dog.

12:37.216 --> 12:40.439
A little mustard, a
little special sauce...

12:40.440 --> 12:44.760
Hey, look, someone
just won a goldfish.

12:45.127 --> 12:46.571
Enjoy.

12:46.572 --> 12:48.559
Uh, no thanks.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.105
Corn dogs are gross.

12:50.106 --> 12:55.746
I'm just gonna eat this garlic
and anchovy pizza instead.

12:56.112 --> 12:58.272
Ha! Hot.

13:03.267 --> 13:05.669
- Here's the mouthwash.
- Hope this works.

13:05.670 --> 13:09.251
- I hope you pour faster. Go go go!
- I'm going. Don't tell me what to do.

13:09.252 --> 13:13.439
Okay, now you're both having
fun at the squirt-gun booth.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.872
And...

13:14.873 --> 13:16.913
Action!

13:20.814 --> 13:24.383
Kira, turn to Austin and give
him a big open-mouthed smile.

13:24.384 --> 13:25.718
Wider.

13:25.719 --> 13:28.179
Wider! Wider!

13:29.408 --> 13:31.568
Ah! Hey!

13:31.658 --> 13:34.033
You're silly.

13:34.034 --> 13:36.734
Oh! No, no, no!

13:38.976 --> 13:42.026
We can't get Kira to freshen her breath.
Nothing's working.

13:42.027 --> 13:44.907
That girl can't take
a hint or a mint.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.116
What are we going to do?
We can't fire her.

13:47.117 --> 13:51.644
Plan B... we're going to get her to
quit by making me seem disgusting.

13:51.645 --> 13:53.612
I'm going to drool all over her.

13:53.613 --> 13:57.397
I'm attaching this drool tube to Austin's
cheek using this fake piece of skin.

13:57.398 --> 14:00.394
You won't even
know he has it on.

14:00.395 --> 14:06.248
A little bit here, a little to the
left, a lot to the right. Here and...

14:06.249 --> 14:08.769
Check it out!

14:09.483 --> 14:11.343
Ewe!

14:11.980 --> 14:14.080
Awesome!

14:14.434 --> 14:17.536
All right, time for the kissing scene.
Ally, go get Kira.

14:17.537 --> 14:22.100
Trish, you shut down
the tubs o' fun ride.

14:22.101 --> 14:24.443
The tubs o' fun
ride is now closed.

14:24.444 --> 14:26.321
Please vacate the area.

14:26.322 --> 14:27.711
Again?!

14:27.712 --> 14:32.032
You're destroying my
childhood memories!

14:32.452 --> 14:36.584
Memories are overrated.
Stop living in the past.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.625
Go on.

14:40.935 --> 14:44.191
All right, guys, I'm fighting the clock
so this'll be the last shot of the day.

14:44.192 --> 14:46.172
And...

14:46.602 --> 14:47.879
Action!

14:47.880 --> 14:50.301
You're two kids in love.
You're in a bucket.

14:50.302 --> 14:52.061
Now kiss!

14:52.062 --> 14:53.862
Ah!

14:54.441 --> 14:55.474
What's wrong?

14:55.475 --> 14:57.576
Uh, nothing.

14:57.577 --> 14:59.179
All right, let's try this again.

14:59.180 --> 15:02.840
Austin, lean in for the kiss.

15:03.387 --> 15:05.839
Ewe! I'm sorry, I can't do this.

15:05.840 --> 15:11.060
I, uh, forgot that I don't
want to be an actress.

15:13.627 --> 15:15.428
Yay!

15:15.429 --> 15:18.237
- It worked!
- Ewe!

15:18.238 --> 15:21.467
You heard her. She doesn't
even want to be an actress.

15:21.468 --> 15:23.785
We didn't need the
drool tube after all.

15:23.786 --> 15:25.766
Girls!

15:33.106 --> 15:36.466
Oh, hi. Excuse me. Hello.

15:36.637 --> 15:38.365
What are all these
girls doing here?

15:38.366 --> 15:40.969
We're recasting Austin's
girlfriend for the video.

15:40.970 --> 15:46.392
It may take a while. Austin and Dez
are being really picky this time.

15:46.393 --> 15:49.033
Breathe, please.

15:49.930 --> 15:51.850
Next.

15:52.192 --> 15:54.349
I don't even want to know.

15:54.350 --> 15:56.583
Austin, I heard what happened.

15:56.584 --> 15:57.812
You did?

15:57.813 --> 16:01.082
How could you not tell me you
have a drooling problem?

16:01.083 --> 16:04.226
- What?
- Kira told me you drool.

16:04.227 --> 16:06.017
It's okay, son.

16:06.018 --> 16:09.078
I too was a drooler.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.923
Uh, well...

16:11.985 --> 16:16.245
Then you must know...
it's been hard.

16:16.690 --> 16:18.479
We know it bothered
Kira, but don't worry.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.826
We're recasting now so
we can finish the video.

16:20.827 --> 16:25.026
Forget it. Thank you
for coming, ladies.

16:25.027 --> 16:30.247
Austin, there's someone here
who wants to apologize.

16:30.437 --> 16:32.597
Austin...

16:32.897 --> 16:34.511
I'm sorry for quitting.

16:34.512 --> 16:38.105
I shouldn't have been so insensitive
about your drooling problem.

16:38.106 --> 16:40.794
Um, that... that's okay.

16:40.795 --> 16:45.684
So good news... I've decided
to finish the video.

16:45.685 --> 16:47.265
Great.

16:47.266 --> 16:50.150
Now we can do the kissing scene.

16:50.151 --> 16:52.319
You better not enjoy it.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.560
Oh, trust me, I won't.

16:55.738 --> 16:59.589
My daughter's reaction made me realize
that your drooling story needs to be told.

16:59.590 --> 17:01.750
It does?

17:03.772 --> 17:07.481
I've arranged for you to speak to the
Kids' Club of Miami this afternoon.

17:07.482 --> 17:10.930
Tell them how drooling didn't keep
you from achieving your dreams.

17:10.931 --> 17:14.260
- Well, it didn't.
- Great!

17:14.261 --> 17:16.244
Let's go, Kira.

17:16.246 --> 17:19.007
Perfect! Now I have
to kiss Kira...

17:19.008 --> 17:22.471
And let the whole world know I have
a disgusting drooling problem.

17:22.472 --> 17:23.838
It's okay, buddy.

17:23.839 --> 17:26.108
We'll get through this
drooling problem together.

17:26.109 --> 17:28.610
I don't have a drooling problem!

17:28.611 --> 17:30.651
But you clearly have
some anger problems.

17:30.652 --> 17:35.932
It's probably a side effect
of the drooling problem.

17:40.482 --> 17:44.382
Ladies and gentlemen,
Austin Moon!

17:50.250 --> 17:52.073
Thank you.

17:52.074 --> 17:54.655
Austin's about to give his speech
to the Kids' Club of Miami.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.592
- Is his drooling rig ready?
- Yep, the tank's all full.

17:57.593 --> 18:00.428
It took me hours to fill
it up with my drool.

18:00.429 --> 18:05.109
Why didn't you just
fill it up with water?

18:10.118 --> 18:14.972
Hi, kids, I'm Austin Moon,
and I drool... a lot!

18:14.973 --> 18:20.493
But I didn't let that stop
me from pursuing my dreams.

18:22.526 --> 18:24.327
Woo!

18:24.328 --> 18:26.396
Now that is inspiring.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.257
Woo!

18:28.793 --> 18:31.958
Give him a little more drool.
The kids can barely see it.

18:31.959 --> 18:35.158
Oh, trust me, he's going
to get a lot more drool.

18:35.159 --> 18:38.091
No, seriously, this knob
just came off in my hand.

18:38.092 --> 18:39.096
Fix it!

18:39.097 --> 18:44.997
If you work hard and don't give up, success
will flow out of you like a river.

18:46.871 --> 18:48.731
Ewe!

18:51.943 --> 18:53.743
Ah!

18:56.187 --> 19:01.308
It's those kind of reactions
that you have to rise above.

19:01.309 --> 19:03.562
Austin, what's going on?

19:03.563 --> 19:05.543
Jimmy!

19:06.958 --> 19:11.115
Look, Jimmy, the truth is I don't
actually have a drooling problem.

19:11.116 --> 19:12.996
No, really?

19:12.997 --> 19:16.785
The tube dangling from your
face kind of gave it away.

19:16.786 --> 19:20.997
Sorry, Jimmy. We lied about the
drooling so Kira would quit the video.

19:20.998 --> 19:23.022
Austin didn't want to
kiss her because...

19:23.023 --> 19:25.394
- She has bad breath.
- Bad breath?

19:25.395 --> 19:29.218
We're talking really bad. On
a scale of one to 10, 87.

19:29.219 --> 19:32.579
- At least.
- 89, really.

19:33.108 --> 19:35.118
How could you not know?

19:35.119 --> 19:38.185
Well, when I was eight, I had a
procedure to fix my drooling...

19:38.186 --> 19:41.786
Took away my sense of smell.

19:44.302 --> 19:46.810
So you don't smell
anything right now?

19:46.811 --> 19:48.638
Nope.

19:48.639 --> 19:51.831
Dez, we can still smell.

19:51.832 --> 19:53.812
Gross!

19:56.040 --> 19:58.586
I'm sorry, Jimmy, we
should have been honest.

19:58.587 --> 20:00.722
But we didn't want to
hurt Kira's feelings.

20:00.723 --> 20:02.728
And you're not going
to hurt them now.

20:02.729 --> 20:06.149
I'll deal with her breath later, but
we've got a video to finish tonight.

20:06.150 --> 20:07.799
So you'd better
figure something out.

20:07.800 --> 20:12.660
Wait! I know how we can
do the kissing scene.

21:29.699 --> 21:32.467
- Thanks. I heard Jimmy likes it.
- He loves it.

21:32.468 --> 21:36.987
I really appreciate you guys wearing
those masks so I don't catch your colds.

21:36.988 --> 21:38.026
No problem.

21:38.027 --> 21:39.498
- Very sick.
- So contagious.

21:39.499 --> 21:43.219
I know why your cat ran away.

21:49.739 --> 21:52.411
I hope you guys had fun,
because I just got fired.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.843
What happened?

21:53.844 --> 21:56.868
Somebody complained about me.

21:56.869 --> 21:59.389
I wonder who.

22:04.350 --> 22:07.964
Hey, look a photo booth! Let's take some
picture's so we don't forget this day.

22:07.965 --> 22:10.605
Oh, great idea.

22:10.712 --> 22:14.053
Not of the photo booth,
us in the photo booth.

22:14.054 --> 22:16.634
Okay, come on.

22:16.991 --> 22:18.353
