00:08.057 --> 00:09.915
What about an internship
in Manhattan?

00:10.035 --> 00:11.862
Manhattan? Aah! No way!

00:11.864 --> 00:14.431
Come work for me at "Interview""
you would be fantastic.

00:14.433 --> 00:17.151
I am in love
with Sebastian Kydd.

00:17.153 --> 00:18.369
Walt was never gonna love you
in any real way.

00:18.371 --> 00:19.954
I don't understand.

00:19.956 --> 00:21.205
I don't think Walt likes girls.

00:21.207 --> 00:22.790
Are you... gay?

00:22.792 --> 00:25.275
Maggs, don't do this.

00:25.277 --> 00:27.328
I wanna go to the prom
with my hot geek boyfriend.

00:27.330 --> 00:29.613
Is this for me? I wanted
it to be perfect for us.

00:29.615 --> 00:32.448
Here's to
two loose-lipped losers

00:32.451 --> 00:34.418
who created their own messes.

00:34.420 --> 00:37.287
- We've been friends for a long time.
- That means something.

00:37.289 --> 00:39.840
Maybe all it means
is that it's been a long time,

00:39.842 --> 00:42.560
because it certainly doesn't
mean you're a good friend.

00:42.562 --> 00:45.062
Larissa will be going to Kyoto
for part of the summer

00:45.064 --> 00:46.764
and said I could stay
in her loft.

00:46.766 --> 00:48.632
You living alone in New York
would be a big deal.

00:48.634 --> 00:50.351
I wouldn't be alone.
I have Walt.

00:50.353 --> 00:52.019
Hey, Dorrit.
Carrie's not home.

00:52.021 --> 00:53.521
I don't know what's going on

Um, it's Saturday.

02:42.965 --> 02:45.415
So why did you wake me?

02:45.417 --> 02:48.102

is talking about you

03:00.783 --> 03:01.782

about how your boyfriend

that maybe you're gay.

Although Donna did seem
to squash that one

03:09.408 --> 03:12.543
by telling everybody that
we were having mad sex again,

03:12.545 --> 03:13.627
and Maggie was pissed.

is gospel in that town.

- Of course.

kinda creepy.

wanna talk about that stuff anyway.

not have known

07:12.234 --> 07:14.335
Well, apparently,
"in love" Dorrit

is just as sullen with my dad
as she always is.

Wait. Is he fuming?
He must be fuming.

07:19.959 --> 07:21.525
I told him to be careful
how he handles it,

07:21.527 --> 07:23.043
because whatever
he <i>wants</i> her to do,

07:23.045 --> 07:24.861
she'll do the exact opposite.

07:24.863 --> 07:28.549

is meet Miller.

07:28.551 --> 07:30.718
Well, meeting parents
can be rough.

07:30.720 --> 07:31.668
But not for you.

07:31.670 --> 07:33.971
Nope. They've been
shockingly okay.

07:33.973 --> 07:35.672
My G.P.A. improved,

07:35.674 --> 07:37.391
and I added
some extracurriculars,

07:37.393 --> 07:39.176
so they think West
is good for me.

07:39.178 --> 07:41.145
So you've been having
a good summer?

07:41.147 --> 07:42.396
Totally.

07:42.398 --> 07:44.932
We've been taking
S.A.T. prep classes

07:44.934 --> 07:47.217
and A.P. calculus
to beef up our course load.

07:47.219 --> 07:50.720
Yeah. Sounds awesome.
Are you doing anything fun?

07:50.722 --> 07:51.905
That <i>is</i> fun.

07:51.907 --> 07:54.825
But I refuse to go
to the country club

07:54.827 --> 07:57.027
now that that skank Maggie
is working there.

07:57.029 --> 07:58.779
You don't have to do that
for me, Mouse.

07:58.781 --> 08:01.081
But what she did to you
and Walt was awful.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.584
Not gonna forgive her and not
going to the country club

08:03.586 --> 08:04.918
and risk seeing her,

08:04.920 --> 08:07.588
even if it means I have to miss
the 4th of July Barbecue.

08:07.590 --> 08:10.090
Oh, but you love going to that.
You should go.

08:10.092 --> 08:11.208
Take West with you.

08:11.210 --> 08:13.577
I do love the fireworks

08:13.579 --> 08:16.096
and the red, white, and blue
sparkler sheet cake.

08:16.098 --> 08:20.634
So go. Maybe we will, but
I'm ignoring that tart.

08:20.636 --> 08:22.219
You wanna come with us?

08:22.221 --> 08:23.520
I think I'll pass.

08:23.522 --> 08:24.805
There are a few people
I'm trying to avoid,

08:24.807 --> 08:26.807
and it's not just Maggie.

08:26.809 --> 08:29.893
You're gonna have to see
Sebastian someday, Carrie.

08:29.895 --> 08:33.414
He hurt you. It doesn't mean
he doesn't regret it.

08:33.416 --> 08:37.034
Well, I don't have time
for regrets, only fun.

08:37.035 --> 08:38.986
I have to get back to the city.

08:38.988 --> 08:41.121
Come on.

08:47.412 --> 08:49.746
What do you think
Donna's cousin is like?

08:49.748 --> 08:50.947
He's a bouncer, right?

08:50.949 --> 08:52.332
Mm-hmm. I'm hoping
hot and beefy.

08:53.586 --> 08:55.669
You make him sound
like a hot dog.

08:55.671 --> 08:57.421
I thought you were
all into Bennett.

08:57.423 --> 09:01.592
I am, but since I'm not 18 yet,
and I have a pulse,

09:01.594 --> 09:03.343
I'm allowed to look
at other people.

09:03.345 --> 09:05.596
Fair enough. Just wondering
where you guys stood.

09:05.598 --> 09:07.648
I really like him.

09:07.650 --> 09:09.066
And he's flirty,

09:09.068 --> 09:11.518
but it just feels like
we're in nowhere's land

09:11.520 --> 09:13.020
until I'm legal.

09:13.022 --> 09:15.255
It's annoying.

09:15.257 --> 09:17.157
You sure you wanna move
your queen there?

09:17.159 --> 09:20.777
No. Aren't I protecting
my knight?

09:20.779 --> 09:22.312
Yeah, but you just left
your king vulnerable.

09:22.314 --> 09:23.664
You should have given up
your queen.

09:23.666 --> 09:24.865
I don't get this game.

09:24.867 --> 09:27.284
Sometimes you have to
sacrifice something valuable

09:27.286 --> 09:28.585
in order to win.

09:28.587 --> 09:29.986
How did <i>you</i> figure
all this out?

09:29.988 --> 09:32.422
Sebastian and I used to play.

09:32.424 --> 09:35.876
He's amazing. It was always like
he could see three moves ahead.

09:35.878 --> 09:37.261
So he's a player.

09:37.263 --> 09:38.512
You said it.

09:38.514 --> 09:42.499
- I didn't mean it that way.
- It's fine.

09:42.501 --> 09:44.601
And you're not bummed we're
going out with Donna tonight?

09:44.603 --> 09:47.054
What? No. Um, she's been
a great friend to you,

09:47.056 --> 09:48.838
and I wanna try someplace new.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.525
I feel like we always go
to the same three places...

09:51.527 --> 09:54.177
Limelight, Area,
and Danceteria.

09:54.179 --> 09:56.012
Well, we could do worse.

09:56.014 --> 09:57.481
The hottest clubs in town,

09:57.483 --> 09:59.900
those magic faxes
you have in your purse.

09:59.902 --> 10:01.785
I do enjoy having all access

10:01.787 --> 10:03.203
to all the coolest clubs,

10:03.205 --> 10:05.122
but it'll be fun to mix it up.

10:05.124 --> 10:08.408
And we're going with Donna,
so there's bound to be drama.

10:08.410 --> 10:10.026
Yoo-hoo!

10:10.028 --> 10:12.462
I brought wine coolers!

10:12.464 --> 10:14.164
♪ Why let it stop you

10:14.166 --> 10:17.701
Oh. Oh, yeah,
and Sebastian.

10:17.703 --> 10:19.686
♪ Can't stop the world

10:19.688 --> 10:21.705
♪ can't stop the world

10:26.178 --> 10:27.312
Your drink, madame.

10:27.314 --> 10:30.398
I hope she's not upset
that I brought him.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.483
What?

10:31.485 --> 10:33.551
I don't do
public transportation,

10:33.553 --> 10:36.054
and he drives a Porsche.
This'll be fun.

10:36.056 --> 10:38.740
Or a total disaster.

10:42.728 --> 10:44.863
I hope it's okay I came.

10:44.865 --> 10:45.997
Oh, yeah, of course.
I mean, sure.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.449
Who wouldn't wanna be
in Manhattan

10:47.451 --> 10:49.117
over Castlebury, anyway?

10:49.119 --> 10:50.735
I totally get it.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.237
I came to see you.

10:53.573 --> 10:54.906
Oh.

10:54.908 --> 10:56.374
Since you wouldn't see me,

10:56.376 --> 10:58.627
and then you kinda
just disappeared.

10:58.629 --> 11:00.095
Uh, I didn't disappear.

11:00.097 --> 11:03.198
I just have a life here
in the city this summer.

11:04.518 --> 11:06.217
You changed your hair.

11:06.219 --> 11:07.802
Yeah. Yeah. Well...

11:07.804 --> 11:10.438
A lot's changed
since I last saw you.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.524
I can see that.

11:12.526 --> 11:14.859
Hey, can we talk?

11:14.861 --> 11:16.111
Uh, you know, I would love to,

11:16.113 --> 11:18.429
but I-I really gotta
get going.

11:18.431 --> 11:20.398
Oh. You're not going out
with us?

11:20.400 --> 11:22.433
Can't.

11:22.435 --> 11:24.268
What do you mean? I thought
we were all going to Donna's...

11:24.270 --> 11:25.436
I, uh, I have to go to Area.

11:25.438 --> 11:26.437
I haven't been in ages,

11:26.439 --> 11:28.239
and, well,
everyone from the magazine

11:28.241 --> 11:31.409
is expecting me, so, um,
you guys do your thing,

11:31.411 --> 11:33.828
and, um, maybe we'll
meet up later.

11:33.830 --> 11:35.814
Sounds good. Have fun!

11:35.816 --> 11:37.966
I love being the only girl.

11:37.968 --> 11:40.085
Carrie, wait.
If... you change your mind,

11:40.087 --> 11:41.619
just meet up with us, okay?

11:41.621 --> 11:42.671
Donna's cousin's bar

11:42.673 --> 11:44.139
is right around the corner
from the loft,

11:44.141 --> 11:45.790
so you know where to find us.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.458
I won't change my mind.

11:47.460 --> 11:48.810
Do you want company?

11:48.812 --> 11:50.461
Are you kidding?
I'm supes excited

11:50.463 --> 11:52.397
to be heading out
on my own tonight.

11:53.983 --> 11:57.802
Have fun.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.070
Well, that went well.

11:59.072 --> 12:00.922
Is she ever gonna talk to me?

12:00.924 --> 12:02.273
She just did.

12:02.275 --> 12:04.409
Carrie's got
a big social calendar.

12:04.411 --> 12:05.944
Yeah, apparently.

12:05.946 --> 12:07.278
Okay, there's no way
I'm gonna waste my night

12:07.280 --> 12:10.281
being all boo-hooey
about yesterday's news,

12:10.283 --> 12:13.268
so let's get our buzz on
and have fun.

12:21.211 --> 12:23.845
Ah. Hey there.

12:23.847 --> 12:25.747
So what are you up to tonight?

12:25.749 --> 12:28.700
Going to Audrey's.
Probably gonna sleep there.

12:28.702 --> 12:29.918
Great.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.970
Sounds great.

12:33.055 --> 12:35.506
Hey, you don't mind
if I, uh, call Audrey's mom

12:35.508 --> 12:38.676
just to make sure
it's okay, do you?

12:38.678 --> 12:40.178
Do whatever you want.

12:47.554 --> 12:49.554
Hi. This is, uh,
Tom Bradshaw.

12:49.556 --> 12:51.990
I'd like to speak with Monica,
please.

12:51.992 --> 12:54.042
Audrey's going to get
her mother.

12:54.044 --> 12:55.326
That's nice.

12:55.328 --> 12:57.796
Hey, Monica,
it's Tom Bradshaw. How are ya?

12:57.798 --> 12:59.664
Great, great. Listen,
I just wanna make sure

12:59.666 --> 13:01.132
it was okay if Dorrit
stayed over.

13:01.134 --> 13:03.952
Uh, she's been over there
the last few weeks quite a bit,

13:03.954 --> 13:05.920
and I just wouldn't want you
to feel like

13:05.922 --> 13:08.706
she'd overstayed her welcome.

13:10.142 --> 13:11.375
Great.

13:11.377 --> 13:14.179
Okay, well, I'm...
I'm glad you feel that way.

13:14.181 --> 13:16.264
She'll see you soon.

13:17.717 --> 13:20.518
So Audrey's mom
is happy to have you.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.571
Whatever. Why do you even
care all of a sudden?

13:23.573 --> 13:25.907
No. I...

13:25.909 --> 13:31.496
I know that you've been...
seeing a boy.

13:31.498 --> 13:34.282
Ugh. Why does Carrie have
to be such a blabbermouth?

13:34.284 --> 13:35.583
She assumed that I knew,
Dorrit,

13:35.585 --> 13:36.868
which apparently I should have.

13:36.870 --> 13:37.952
If you're going steady
with someone,

13:37.954 --> 13:39.287
then I should meet him.

13:39.289 --> 13:40.955
No way. The fact that you even
said the word "steady"

13:40.957 --> 13:42.507
means you're too big
of a geek to meet him.

13:42.509 --> 13:45.009
Dorrit, I'm not trying
to be cool.

13:45.011 --> 13:46.778
I'm trying to be your dad.

13:46.780 --> 13:48.346
And it wasn't a request.

13:48.348 --> 13:51.049
If you wanna keep seeing
this...

13:51.051 --> 13:54.135
Miller fellow,
then I need to meet him.

13:54.137 --> 13:56.187
Fine.

13:57.423 --> 13:58.440
You coming?

13:58.442 --> 13:59.524
Where?

13:59.526 --> 14:01.259
I'm driving you to Audrey's.

14:01.261 --> 14:03.695
I wouldn't want you
to have to walk there.

14:03.697 --> 14:05.780
Fine.
I need to get my stuff.

14:05.782 --> 14:07.431
I'll meet you at the car.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:21.498 --> 14:22.714
Hello.

14:22.716 --> 14:24.615
- We're screwed.
- What happened?

14:24.617 --> 14:26.918
My dad knows about you.
He wants to meet you.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.287
Well, I wanna get to know
your family.

14:29.289 --> 14:30.505
Trust me, you don't.

14:30.507 --> 14:32.140
All this means is we'll
never be alone ever again.

14:32.142 --> 14:34.759
He'll be all over us.
I have to go.

14:34.761 --> 14:37.312
Where? I told my dad I had
a sleepover at Audrey's.

14:37.314 --> 14:39.314
Luckily, Audrey's as good
at lying as I am,

14:39.316 --> 14:40.815
and impersonating her mother.

14:40.817 --> 14:43.067
But now I'm stuck
at her house all night.

14:43.069 --> 14:45.069
And now
he's waiting in the car.

14:45.071 --> 14:48.656
See? Already all over me.
Call when I can.

14:53.646 --> 14:54.829
Right this way.

14:54.831 --> 14:58.416
I love this party!

14:58.418 --> 15:00.001
I dream about the flag cake
all year.

15:00.003 --> 15:01.786
It's a cake shaped
like an American flag,

15:01.788 --> 15:02.921
and it's huge.

15:02.923 --> 15:04.422
Awesome. I can't wait.

15:04.424 --> 15:07.625
I'm so excited you get to see
the fireworks with me.

15:07.627 --> 15:08.760
They're legendary.

15:08.762 --> 15:09.761
So I've heard.

15:09.763 --> 15:12.680
Your waiter will be
with you shortly.

15:12.682 --> 15:15.149
Hopefully Maggie
isn't working tonight.

15:15.151 --> 15:16.801
Ahem.

15:16.803 --> 15:18.870
Hi, Maggie.

15:20.306 --> 15:22.056
So I'll be your server tonight.

15:22.058 --> 15:23.808
Great.

15:23.810 --> 15:25.310
Great.

15:25.312 --> 15:26.694
Can I get you guys some drinks
while you look at the menus?

15:26.696 --> 15:27.845
We know what we want.

15:27.847 --> 15:29.731
But I haven't even
looked at the menu.

15:29.733 --> 15:31.366
Chicken fingers.

15:31.368 --> 15:34.669
Is that seriously
all you're gonna say to me?

15:34.671 --> 15:36.371
With honey mustard.

15:36.373 --> 15:39.357
Fine.

15:39.359 --> 15:41.376
Wait.

15:44.246 --> 15:45.880
I didn't order.

15:45.882 --> 15:47.531
<i>I may have lost</i>
<i>my group that night...</i>

15:47.533 --> 15:49.867
Sorry, folks.
We're at capacity.

15:49.869 --> 15:52.587
<i>But I hadn't lost</i>
<i>my new attitude.</i>

15:52.589 --> 15:55.189
Carrie Bradshaw.
I'm on the list.

15:55.191 --> 15:56.707
You gonna let us know
or what?

15:56.709 --> 15:58.709
Sorry. Not on it.

15:58.711 --> 16:01.712
Well, I-I faxed over
my request earlier this week

16:01.714 --> 16:03.314
from "Interview" magazine.

16:03.316 --> 16:05.183
Do you have a business card?

16:05.185 --> 16:06.568
I have even better...
The fax you sent me back,

16:06.570 --> 16:08.719
confirming
that I was on the list.

16:08.721 --> 16:11.773
Oh, it's in here somewhere.
Damn it.

16:16.529 --> 16:18.062
Here. Yeah.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.197
Here it is.

16:19.199 --> 16:22.083
Uh, this is confirming
Carrie Bradshaw plus one

16:22.085 --> 16:25.536
will be coming to Area
on Friday. See? There it is.

16:25.538 --> 16:27.922
I see it.
Who's your plus one?

16:29.426 --> 16:32.460
She is.

16:32.462 --> 16:34.745
See you, guys!

16:38.018 --> 16:40.418
What? My...

16:40.420 --> 16:43.688
My... my purse.
My...

16:43.690 --> 16:45.390
My purse is... gone.

16:45.392 --> 16:46.774
My... my Carrie purse.

16:46.776 --> 16:49.593
Did you see someone pick it up?

16:49.595 --> 16:51.646
Someone...
My... my purse.

16:51.648 --> 16:53.982
My purse is gone.
It's gone.

16:53.984 --> 16:55.650
My... my Carrie purse is gone.
It just...

16:55.652 --> 16:59.253
Someone stole my Carrie purse!

17:03.010 --> 17:04.726
It had everything.
It had everything...

17:04.846 --> 17:07.060
My... my... my keys, my money,
my... my charge card.

17:07.181 --> 17:10.733
I just... I can't believe
some jerk stole my purse.

17:10.734 --> 17:13.202
Hey, hey, did you see someone
walk by with a purse?

17:13.204 --> 17:14.403
It has "Carrie" on it.

17:14.405 --> 17:16.204
Your bag is long gone.

17:16.207 --> 17:17.406
No, no.

17:17.407 --> 17:19.909
May-maybe someone
picked it up by accident,

17:19.911 --> 17:21.292
and... and... and they're
gonna return it.

17:21.295 --> 17:23.596
It says "Carrie" on it,
and my mom gave it to me.

17:23.598 --> 17:26.082
It was hers.
Your mom's name is "Carrie"?

17:26.084 --> 17:30.386
No. No, as you well know,
that is <i>my</i> name. Carrie.

17:30.388 --> 17:31.837
Carrie Bradshaw.

17:31.839 --> 17:33.923
The name I gave you.
The name that should have been

17:33.925 --> 17:37.059
on the list and wasn't,
so I had to show you

17:37.061 --> 17:38.894
that stupid fax,
and now my purse is stolen!

17:38.896 --> 17:44.266
My mom's purse. I...
I loved that purse.

17:44.268 --> 17:45.918
Was part of who I am.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.155
Look, it sucks
that your bag got stolen.

17:49.157 --> 17:50.856
But I got a line
that I have to manage.

17:50.858 --> 17:53.725
So what do you wanna do?
You wanna come in or not?

17:53.727 --> 17:58.330
<i>While I was now between</i>
<i>a rock and a hard place...</i>

that's Ric Ocasek from the Cars.

Well, I'm pretty sure

18:22.254 --> 18:23.808
he's wearing more makeup

18:23.928 --> 18:26.206
This is like <i>the</i> bar

18:39.838 --> 18:42.606
I'm drinking a beer, aren't I?

18:42.608 --> 18:46.143
I know what I like,
and... it's not here.

18:46.145 --> 18:48.312
Well, we could go meet Carrie.
She's at Area,

18:48.314 --> 18:50.814
and there are plenty of
douchey stockbroker types there.

18:50.816 --> 18:51.982
<i>♪ Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa</i>

18:51.984 --> 18:54.785
what? It's true.
They hang out there.

18:54.787 --> 18:55.953
Not real sure
Carrie would appreciate me

18:55.955 --> 18:57.371
crashing her party.

18:57.373 --> 18:58.622
She made that pretty clear.

18:58.624 --> 19:03.460
She may have... exaggerated
her plans for the night.

19:03.462 --> 19:04.995
What do you mean?

19:04.997 --> 19:06.130
Oldest trick in the book...

19:06.132 --> 19:08.132
make it seem like you have
way better plans

19:08.134 --> 19:09.800
than the person who dumped you.

19:09.802 --> 19:11.001
I didn't dump her.

19:11.003 --> 19:13.036
Oh, fine. Cheated on,
whatever.

19:13.038 --> 19:15.806
If there are gonna be
hot preppies, I say we go.

19:15.808 --> 19:17.874
<i>♪ Lovin' every minute of it ♪</i>
I don't know.

19:17.876 --> 19:19.557
Carrie just wanted
to make it seem like

19:19.679 --> 19:22.563
she... had a lot going on.

19:22.565 --> 19:25.850
That's insane. She doesn't
have anything to prove to me.

19:25.852 --> 19:28.235
Blah, blah, blah. So bored.

19:28.237 --> 19:29.570
While we're here moping,

19:29.572 --> 19:31.906
Carrie's probably having
the night of her life.

19:31.908 --> 19:36.160
Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.164
Ow.

19:40.166 --> 19:42.249
I can't believe we have to have
Maggie as our waitress.

19:42.251 --> 19:44.785
Come on. This is your
favorite night of the summer.

19:44.787 --> 19:46.253
Forget Maggie.

19:46.255 --> 19:48.455
You're right.

19:48.457 --> 19:50.674
I just wish I didn't
have to see her.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.827
Let me know if you need
anything else.

19:53.829 --> 19:57.464
Where's our waitress?
That girl Maggie.

19:57.466 --> 19:58.849
Oh. She asked to switch tables
or something.

19:58.851 --> 20:00.184
I'm not really sure.

20:00.186 --> 20:04.171
Oh. She did, <i>did</i> she?

20:04.173 --> 20:05.523
Is everything okay?

20:05.525 --> 20:08.726
Everything is great.
Thank you.

20:08.728 --> 20:10.261
This is a good thing.

20:10.263 --> 20:11.462
She is just rude!

20:11.464 --> 20:13.614
You don't wanna be around her.
You just said that.

20:13.616 --> 20:16.283
- And I'm pretty sure she sensed that.
- No.

20:16.285 --> 20:18.509
That's not what she's doing.
She's icing me out.

20:18.629 --> 20:19.836
Isn't that what you're
doing to her?

20:19.956 --> 20:22.856
Yeah, but that's because
she's in the wrong. I'm not.

20:22.858 --> 20:24.458
She's the bad friend.
I'm not.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.493
She should be kissing my ass.

20:26.495 --> 20:30.564
How dare she switch tables.

20:39.908 --> 20:41.041
Can I help you?

20:41.043 --> 20:43.010
Hi, sir. I hope
it's not too late to stop by.

20:43.012 --> 20:45.545
I'm Dorrit's boyfriend, Miller.

20:47.265 --> 20:48.732
Excuse me. Excuse me.

20:48.734 --> 20:50.150
Hey.
What are you looking at?

20:50.152 --> 20:52.937
You never seen anyone sweaty
before? Jeez.

20:52.939 --> 20:55.322
Excuse me.

20:55.324 --> 20:57.575
Never come back.  You know,
we're all waiting in line.

20:57.577 --> 20:59.443
Oh. Can I help you?

20:59.445 --> 21:01.278
You seem awfully eager to get in.
Excuse me.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.913
Yeah, that would be
an understatement.

21:02.915 --> 21:04.999
Well, I don't like people
who cut the line.

21:05.001 --> 21:06.000
I believe in democracy.

21:06.002 --> 21:07.534
Look, I'm kind of in a crisis,

21:07.536 --> 21:09.870
and I just need to get in there
and see my friends.

21:09.872 --> 21:12.456
So do all those people
who are waiting patiently.

21:12.458 --> 21:13.924
Look, I didn't want
to have to do this,

21:13.926 --> 21:15.125
but if you don't let me in,

21:15.127 --> 21:17.928
I'm gonna have to tell Sam
you were rude to me.

21:17.930 --> 21:19.847
Oh, really? Sam who?

21:19.849 --> 21:22.716
Sam Jones. So either
get out of my way,

21:22.718 --> 21:25.436
or he's gonna hear all
about this. Do you understand?

21:25.438 --> 21:28.755
Oh, I understand.
And Sam heard everything...

21:28.757 --> 21:30.441
Because I'm Sam Jones.

21:30.443 --> 21:32.393
And P.S.

21:32.395 --> 21:34.628
I prefer "Samantha."

21:39.722 --> 21:43.001
You're Sam?
I-I mean, Samantha?

21:43.003 --> 21:44.720
I just assumed when Donna
said her cousin was a bouncer,

21:44.722 --> 21:46.021
that Sam was a guy.

21:46.023 --> 21:48.390
Wait. You know Donna?
And I prefer the term

21:48.392 --> 21:50.308
"Keeper of the Cool"
to "Bouncer."

21:50.310 --> 21:53.228
Right. Sure. Of course.
Uh, "Keeper of the Cool"

21:53.230 --> 21:56.181
look, I'm not usually
this rude. I-I just...

21:56.183 --> 21:58.033
I lost my purse.
Well, I didn't actually lose it.

21:58.035 --> 22:00.619
It was stolen, and I just...
I don't have any keys or money,

22:00.621 --> 22:02.637
so I had to walk 40 blocks
to get here,

22:02.639 --> 22:05.040
and I just need to get inside
and see my friends

22:05.042 --> 22:06.825
so I can get my keys
and go home.

22:06.827 --> 22:08.593
Why didn't you say
you were a friend of Donna's?

22:08.595 --> 22:11.863
I would've let you right in.
Family trumps democracy any day.

22:11.865 --> 22:13.498
Thank you.
Thanks so much.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.634
Except Donna
and your friends are gone.

22:15.636 --> 22:17.702
What? What do you mean,
gone?

22:17.704 --> 22:19.388
Left. Ditched this place.

22:19.390 --> 22:21.372
Moved on to greener pastures.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.208
You Manhattanites
are like sharks.

22:23.210 --> 22:24.976
Always gotta keep movin'.

22:24.978 --> 22:26.311
That's why I love this place.

22:26.313 --> 22:27.596
I found my people.

22:27.598 --> 22:29.881
- Do you know where they went?
- No idea.

22:29.883 --> 22:33.435
Why don't you go inside?
Have a drink. Have some fun.

22:33.437 --> 22:35.487
Can't. It's a long story.

22:35.489 --> 22:38.056
Yeah. I don't do long stories...
or sob stories.

22:38.058 --> 22:40.242
Well, in that case,
you won't wanna hear mine,

22:40.244 --> 22:43.412
but... would you mind go in
and use the phone?

22:43.414 --> 22:46.331
Sure. And have a drink on me
while you're at it.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.950
Thanks.

22:48.952 --> 22:50.619
Look at her.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.390
All flirty and flitting around.

22:55.392 --> 22:57.309
She's taking their order.

22:57.311 --> 22:59.361
Please.

22:59.363 --> 23:03.014
She doesn't have to be
all laughing and smiley.

23:03.016 --> 23:05.967
She's a waitress,
for God sakes.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.678
All right. I'll be right back
with that, boys.

23:08.798 --> 23:09.636
Thanks.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.474
Excuse me! Waitress!

23:12.476 --> 23:13.859
Excuse me!

23:13.861 --> 23:15.110
- Leave it alone, Mouse.
- Miss.

23:15.112 --> 23:18.246
- Miss!
- What do you want?

23:18.248 --> 23:20.148
I want you to admit that you did
something totally crappy

23:20.150 --> 23:21.599
to Carrie and to Walt.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.502
I did admit it.
I have apologized,

23:23.504 --> 23:24.703
like, a thousand times.

23:24.705 --> 23:27.105
You don't think I feel awful
about what I did?

23:27.107 --> 23:29.040
I can't make her forgive me,
and I'm sorry,

23:29.042 --> 23:30.625
but what Walt did to me sucked.

23:30.627 --> 23:32.744
Why is it always about you?

23:32.746 --> 23:34.579
It's never...
it's never about me.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.914
"Poor Carrie. Poor Walt""

23:35.916 --> 23:38.583
nobody ever cares about me
or what I'm going through.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.618
- You do that enough for all of us.
- Do not.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.437
- Do too!
- What is this, the third grade?

23:42.439 --> 23:44.956
Wasn't that the year
you kissed Jamie Bamberger?

23:44.958 --> 23:47.559
The boy I told you I liked?

23:47.561 --> 23:49.165
Ugh. That was the fourth grade,
and he kissed me.

23:49.285 --> 23:50.394
You wish!

23:50.514 --> 23:51.796
You're just jealous
'cause he didn't like you.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.130
He told everyone
that you dumped him

23:54.250 --> 23:57.264
and that you kissed with way
too much tongue!

23:57.384 --> 23:58.128
Oh, careful! Sparklers!

23:58.248 --> 24:01.306
Not the cake! Not the ca...
Not the cake!

24:01.308 --> 24:03.942
And the pool.

24:03.944 --> 24:06.361
Is the cake okay?!

24:13.870 --> 24:15.871
So how will <i>we</i> get in?

24:15.873 --> 24:18.256
I don't think it can be done
without Carrie.

24:18.258 --> 24:19.841
<i>Excuse</i> me. Thank you.

24:19.843 --> 24:21.760
Thank you. Sorry. Thank you.

24:21.762 --> 24:24.513
We don't need Carrie
when we have these.

24:24.515 --> 24:26.681
We don't need those.
I got this.

24:26.683 --> 24:29.351
Hi. We're, uh, friends
of Carrie bradshaw

24:29.353 --> 24:32.804
from "Interview" magazine,
and she got here earlier,

24:32.806 --> 24:34.272
and e supposed to meet her,

24:34.274 --> 24:37.108
- but we got tied up and I think...
- Hey. You know...

24:37.110 --> 24:39.677
You weren't kidding
when you said you got this.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.730
Benjamin always ensures
a warm welcome.

24:41.732 --> 24:44.733
Hey. You guys are going inside
to look for that Carrie chick?

24:44.735 --> 24:46.517
Little? Blonde?

24:46.519 --> 24:48.153
Carrie Bradshaw?

24:48.155 --> 24:50.355
- Yeah. Why?
- She's not in there.

24:50.357 --> 24:51.873
I'm sorry,
but how would you know that?

24:51.875 --> 24:53.858
She's so tiny.
She barely makes an impression.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.293
She did tonight.

24:55.295 --> 24:56.661
Had her purse stolen
right out here.

24:56.663 --> 25:00.165
Wait. Was she mugged?
Is she okay? Where'd she go?

25:00.167 --> 25:01.633
She's fine.
She was just stupid enough

25:01.635 --> 25:03.218
to put her purse
down on the street.

25:03.220 --> 25:05.003
She's not stupid.
She's trusting.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.471
Do you know where she went?

25:06.473 --> 25:09.457
Nope. Just know she didn't have
enough money for a cab.

25:09.459 --> 25:11.676
She probably went back
to Samantha's bar

25:11.678 --> 25:13.845
to look for us. We should
probably get back there.

25:16.232 --> 25:17.732
You coming?

25:17.734 --> 25:20.735
How you doin'?

25:20.737 --> 25:22.103
You know what?
I-I think I'll stay here.

25:22.105 --> 25:27.558
Much more my speed.
Don't wait up! Boys?

25:27.560 --> 25:28.743
Boys!
Let's go find Carrie.

25:28.745 --> 25:30.362
- I'm worried.
- She's okay, Sebastian.

25:30.364 --> 25:32.497
- She knows how to take care of herself.
- Yeah, I know that.

25:32.499 --> 25:33.865
I just don't want her
to have to.

25:33.867 --> 25:37.953
No, you don't understand.
It was my mother's purse. Yeah.

25:37.955 --> 25:40.538
Ow. Would it kill you
to say "excuse me"?

25:40.540 --> 25:42.457
No. No, I'm... I'm sorry,
officer.

25:42.459 --> 25:44.342
I-I was talking
to someone else.

25:44.344 --> 25:46.577
Yes, I-I understand
that you have

25:46.579 --> 25:49.614
a lot of other cases
to handle, and...

25:49.616 --> 25:54.919
No. I-I didn't realize there are
20 murders a week in Manhattan.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.805
That's good to know. Um...

25:56.807 --> 25:59.107
but if I could just describe
the purse to you again.

25:59.109 --> 26:02.027
It's very important to me. It
had sentimental value.

26:02.029 --> 26:03.594
What'd you do that for?

26:03.596 --> 26:06.431
I think I was finally
getting somewhere.

26:06.433 --> 26:09.234
Oh, Bambi. You were
getting nowhere fast.

26:09.236 --> 26:10.785
My boss is getting pissed
you're hogging the phone.

26:10.787 --> 26:12.103
His drug dealer can't reach him

26:12.105 --> 26:13.955
if the line's busy.

26:13.957 --> 26:16.441
- I'm sorry about that.
- Don't worry.

26:16.443 --> 26:18.609
Let's get you something
to calm you down, huh?

26:18.611 --> 26:20.161
Maybe some tea.

26:20.163 --> 26:22.447
Oh, yeah. Tea would be lovely,
thank you.

26:23.717 --> 26:25.216
Here you go.

26:25.218 --> 26:28.453
That is not tea.

26:28.455 --> 26:30.505
Sure it is.
Long Island Iced Tea.

26:30.507 --> 26:32.957
Well, is there any
actual tea in it?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.759
Tea-quila.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.511
It's delish!

26:36.513 --> 26:38.063
And you could use some delish.

26:38.065 --> 26:40.982
No, what I could use
are some keys to my apartment.

26:40.984 --> 26:42.317
You're not gonna stop

26:42.319 --> 26:44.986
with this whole "I need
to go home" thing, are you?

26:44.988 --> 26:46.738
Probably not.

26:46.740 --> 26:49.941
Okay. If you promise
no more boo-hooing,

26:49.943 --> 26:53.278
- I'll get you into your place.
- You can do that?

26:53.280 --> 26:56.831
Just no more whining, okay?
Promise me.

26:56.833 --> 26:58.984
Yes. I promise.

27:01.138 --> 27:04.756
You expect me
to climb up the fire escape

27:04.758 --> 27:06.875
to break into my own apartment?

27:06.877 --> 27:10.161
You wanna break
into someone else's? I'm game.

27:10.163 --> 27:12.847
- No.
- Okay.

27:12.849 --> 27:14.683
Let's get to it, then.

27:14.685 --> 27:15.934
But it's like 20 feet up
from here.

27:15.936 --> 27:17.552
You promised no whining.

27:17.554 --> 27:19.003
Are you crazy?

27:19.005 --> 27:20.505
Hmm.

27:23.359 --> 27:29.064
<i>Suddenly I was very worried</i>
<i>she might be.</i>

27:38.190 --> 27:41.158
Just give me a little push.
You're too tiny.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.110
Kinda using all I have here.

27:43.112 --> 27:46.080
Oh, just a few more inches.

27:46.082 --> 27:48.198
That's what I always hope for.
If I had some,

27:48.200 --> 27:49.917
I'd give them to you.

27:49.919 --> 27:51.669
Stop moving.
Ohh!

27:51.671 --> 27:55.322
Kinda wish you would warn me you
weren't wearing any underwear.

27:55.324 --> 27:57.007
I'm not wearing any underwear.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.443
Yeah. I know. I can see that.
Oh! That's my face.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.994
That's my face.

28:00.996 --> 28:02.379
Uhh!

28:05.568 --> 28:07.051
Samantha.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.969
Samantha, we have company.

28:08.971 --> 28:11.639
- Good. Maybe they can help us.
- No.

28:11.641 --> 28:16.477
I don't think so.
Hello, officers.

28:16.479 --> 28:19.480
Cops?  Oh, jeez.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.520
Uhh!

28:31.360 --> 28:34.078
- Say nothing.
- What's the circus act about, ladies?

28:34.080 --> 28:36.547
Officers, I am so glad
you are here.

28:36.549 --> 28:39.883
I'm Carrie Bradshaw.
I called the precinct earlier,

28:39.885 --> 28:41.669
and no one listened to me.
No one.

28:41.671 --> 28:43.303
I'm trying to get
into my own apartment

28:43.305 --> 28:44.588
because my purse was stolen.

28:44.590 --> 28:47.874
Wait. Are you the chick
who keeps calling precinct 37?

28:47.876 --> 28:50.761
Yes, yes, that's me.
Has there been any progress?

28:50.763 --> 28:51.929
Did you find my purse?

28:52.881 --> 28:54.565
Your purse is gone, sweetheart.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.517
Everyone's just been
laughing about you.

28:56.519 --> 28:59.403
Oh. Well, I don't see how
losing my dead mother's purse

28:59.405 --> 29:02.389
is so funny, but I guess
having to crawl up a fire escape

29:02.391 --> 29:04.825
to get into my own apartment
is just a hoot.

29:04.827 --> 29:07.745
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.
It's just a purse.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.062
I wish that was the case.

29:09.064 --> 29:10.080
Look...

29:10.082 --> 29:12.249
Bambi here has had
a pretty rough night.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.784
Any chance you big boys
could give me

29:13.786 --> 29:15.085
a lift up to the fire escape

29:15.087 --> 29:17.421
so I could break her
into her apartment?

29:17.423 --> 29:18.756
No one else should have to deal
with her tonight.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.208
She's pretty...

29:21.210 --> 29:22.960
Emotional.

29:22.962 --> 29:26.046
It's true, and I could just
get worse, you know?

29:26.048 --> 29:27.598
There might even be tears.

29:27.600 --> 29:33.020
So what do you say?
You wanna give me a boost?

29:37.977 --> 29:39.026
Dorrit?

29:39.028 --> 29:42.146
Dorrit, look who's here.

29:48.586 --> 29:49.376
Hey.

29:49.496 --> 29:50.487
Hey.

29:50.489 --> 29:51.955
Hope it's okay I stopped by.

29:51.957 --> 29:55.075
Sure. I guess.
Kinda late.

29:55.077 --> 29:57.110
Yeah. I thought you were
staying at Audrey's.

29:57.112 --> 29:58.829
I was, until her stupid
little brother

29:58.831 --> 30:01.248
short-sheeted the bed and glued
together all the drawers.

30:01.250 --> 30:03.167
All hell was breaking loose,
so I figured

30:03.169 --> 30:04.785
it was better if I leave.

30:04.787 --> 30:06.754
What are you doing here?

30:06.756 --> 30:08.122
He came by to see you.

30:08.124 --> 30:09.940
Oh, really?

30:09.942 --> 30:12.109
Yeah, and when you weren't here,
we got to talking.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.293
About what?

30:13.295 --> 30:16.997
Music. Me and your dad
are both big Stones fans.

30:16.999 --> 30:19.183
And Dylan.

30:19.185 --> 30:19.896
Rockin'.

30:20.016 --> 30:22.402
And we're big fans
of your new look.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.471
We both think you look so pretty
with less makeup.

30:24.473 --> 30:26.440
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

30:26.442 --> 30:28.442
We really didn't talk
about it that much.

30:28.444 --> 30:29.576
All right.

30:29.578 --> 30:31.278
Well, I should probably
head upstairs

30:31.280 --> 30:32.913
and give you kids
some time alone.

30:32.915 --> 30:34.448
Uh, but, Miller,
you have to clear out

30:34.450 --> 30:35.783
by, uh, midnight.

30:35.785 --> 30:36.834
- Of course.
- Okay?

30:36.836 --> 30:39.319
Really nice meeting you,
Mr. Bradshaw.

30:39.321 --> 30:41.622
You, too.

30:46.127 --> 30:47.878
What the hell
is going on?

30:47.880 --> 30:50.264
- What do you mean?
-  - You knew I wasn't home.

30:50.266 --> 30:52.633
I also knew that
if I didn't meet your dad,

30:52.635 --> 30:53.684
he'd never let you
out of the house again,

30:53.686 --> 30:56.186
so better to just get it
over with.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.505
That wasn't your call.
It was mine.

30:58.507 --> 31:00.841
You need to stop being stubborn
just to be stubborn.

31:00.843 --> 31:02.109
Be smart about this.

31:02.111 --> 31:06.313
It's kinda gross seeing you
all chummy with my dad.

31:06.315 --> 31:08.181
Yeah, but... now look.

31:08.183 --> 31:11.735
You and me all by ourselves.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.036
I guess.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.371
Come on.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.740
Admit it. I was right.

31:16.742 --> 31:19.126
Don't push it.

31:21.162 --> 31:23.664
I gotta ask,
why are you helping me?

31:23.666 --> 31:26.300
You must be mad at me.
I kissed Maggie.

31:26.302 --> 31:30.170
Yeah, so did I, and that's what
got us into this whole mess.

31:30.172 --> 31:32.422
You didn't betray Carrie.
I did.

31:32.424 --> 31:35.309
But if I had been more honest
with Maggie

31:35.311 --> 31:37.060
and more honest with myself,

31:37.062 --> 31:39.880
then Maggie never
would have freaked out,

31:39.882 --> 31:41.765
and you and Carrie
would still be together.

31:41.767 --> 31:43.684
Yeah, I guess,
but if I didn't tell Maggie

31:43.686 --> 31:46.052
I thought you were gay,
we wouldn't be here either.

31:47.722 --> 31:50.407
That's another way
of looking at it.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.359
I didn't tell her
to make her mad.

31:52.361 --> 31:54.444
I-I was trying to make her
feel better

31:54.446 --> 31:56.747
about why it didn't work out
with you guys.

31:56.749 --> 31:58.665
I had no idea
she would freak out.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.185
You don't know
Maggie that well.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.069
I guess I don't.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.257
How did you know?

32:07.259 --> 32:09.259
Know what?

32:09.261 --> 32:11.762
That I was...

32:11.764 --> 32:12.880
Gay?

32:12.882 --> 32:14.765
Yeah.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.800
I think I just always
kinda knew...

32:16.802 --> 32:20.053
or assumed.

32:20.055 --> 32:21.355
And you were okay with it.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.974
Yeah. Of course.
Why wouldn't I be?

32:23.976 --> 32:26.426
Thanks.

32:26.428 --> 32:28.612
Nothing to thank me for.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.601
I hope you're happy.

32:36.205 --> 32:38.956
That I'm in my golf clothes
with soaking wet hair? Thrilled.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.207
That I got fired.

32:40.209 --> 32:43.443
Apparently, fighting with
a member is frowned upon.

32:43.445 --> 32:45.111
Please.

32:45.113 --> 32:48.048
You only took this job so that
you could hit on hot guys

32:48.050 --> 32:49.316
and drink free booze.

32:49.318 --> 32:52.386
Okay, well, um, I didn't
hate that part of the job,

32:52.388 --> 32:54.287
but I actually need the money.

32:54.289 --> 32:55.389
For what?

32:55.391 --> 32:57.424
You don't get it, Mouse,
do you?

32:57.426 --> 33:00.010
Your parents spend
every waking minute making sure

33:00.012 --> 33:01.929
that you meet your goals,

33:01.931 --> 33:03.964
while mine don't even care
if I have any.

33:03.966 --> 33:05.649
I'm sure that's not true.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.936
There is no money
for me to go to college.

33:08.938 --> 33:12.739
If I wanna go, I have to
pay for it myself.

33:12.741 --> 33:16.126
I didn't know.
I'm... sorry.

33:16.128 --> 33:19.279
It's why I took this job.

33:20.815 --> 33:23.116
Do you want me to try
to get you your job back?

33:23.118 --> 33:25.919
No, it's fine.
Money wasn't that good anyway.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.154
Sure ain't gonna pay
for four years of school.

33:28.156 --> 33:30.474
Then maybe you can get
a scholarship or something.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.759
You've seen my grades, right?

33:32.761 --> 33:33.877
Or financial aid.

33:33.879 --> 33:36.113
I could help you fill out
the papers and stuff.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.865
Maybe. You'd do that?

33:38.867 --> 33:40.968
Of course, Maggie.

33:42.837 --> 33:45.105
I just feel so lost.

33:46.958 --> 33:50.060
Everybody hates me.

33:50.062 --> 33:53.697
I don't hate you.

33:54.682 --> 33:56.850
Thanks.

33:56.852 --> 33:59.486
If I don't go to college,
I'm stuck here.

33:59.488 --> 34:02.155
You're going to college.

34:02.157 --> 34:05.709
Don't worry. I'll help you
figure this out.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.245
Thanks.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.837
Wow. Nice place.

34:16.839 --> 34:18.588
Oh. Thanks.

34:18.590 --> 34:19.723
I'm, uh...

34:19.725 --> 34:21.091
You spoiled suburban kids
sure have it good.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.976
What, your dad pay for this
or something?

34:22.978 --> 34:25.594
Actually, it's not mine.
My... my friend's out of town.

34:25.597 --> 34:26.730
I'm just crashing here.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.766
So you're a mooch.
I could like you, Bambi.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.018
Thank you?

34:31.020 --> 34:33.070
Well, your friend sure has
a lot of crap.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.489
This a chess set?
 So pretentious.

34:35.491 --> 34:37.407
She brought this back
from France.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.742
It's beautiful.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.893
Who needs this much stuff?

34:40.896 --> 34:43.413
Everything I own,
I could fit into a car...

34:43.415 --> 34:45.231
A very small car.

34:45.233 --> 34:46.867
- And that's a good thing?
- When you own things,

34:46.869 --> 34:48.168
you can <i>be</i> owned.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.053
And those things can be stolen.

34:50.054 --> 34:52.289
I just can't believe
my purse is gone.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.406
We all lose things...

34:53.408 --> 34:56.710
Purses, shoes, your house.

34:56.712 --> 34:58.929
Stuff comes. Stuff goes.
Who cares?

34:58.931 --> 35:01.298
Hell, I was wearing underwear
today when I got to the bar.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.699
Now I'm not.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.601
Yeah, our... our trip
up the fire escape

35:04.603 --> 35:06.586
made that very clear.

35:06.588 --> 35:08.171
I really liked that underwear.

35:08.173 --> 35:11.441
And I really liked
my mom's purse.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.561
I just always felt like
I had a piece of her with me.

35:14.563 --> 35:15.896
Sounds like your mom
meant a lot to you.

35:15.898 --> 35:17.731
Doesn't everybody's?

35:19.735 --> 35:23.153
Not everybody's.

35:23.155 --> 35:25.105
Hey, you know that purse...

35:25.107 --> 35:26.156
That ain't your mother,
you know?

35:26.158 --> 35:28.325
It's... just a purse.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.776
I know. I know.

35:29.778 --> 35:33.279
I just hate that Sebastian
threw me off my game.

35:33.281 --> 35:34.498
If he hadn't have been here,

35:34.500 --> 35:36.449
I wouldn't have put my purse
down on the street.

35:36.451 --> 35:39.119
What kind of idiot puts
their purse on the street?

35:39.121 --> 35:41.621
- Yeah, that is stupid.
- Yeah.

35:41.623 --> 35:42.806
But you know what's not stupid?

35:42.808 --> 35:44.641
Is showing him who came out
on top... that's a must.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.842
That's what I think.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.345
You know how you show a guy
you've won?

35:48.347 --> 35:49.963
- By moving on.
- Yes.

35:49.965 --> 35:53.733
- Exactly. That's exactly what I told Walt.
- So move on.

35:53.735 --> 35:57.187
Well, if I knew how to do that,
I would've by now.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.606
Hook up with a hottie.
Does the trick every time.

35:59.608 --> 36:01.441
Come on. Let's go out
and find you one.

36:01.443 --> 36:02.659
Bar's crawling with them.

36:02.661 --> 36:06.496
<i>Maybe it was losing my purse</i>
<i>or finding Samantha,</i>

36:06.498 --> 36:10.700
<i>but suddenly that idea</i>
<i>sounded like a really good one.</i>

36:10.702 --> 36:13.420
You know what?

36:13.422 --> 36:14.487
I'm in.

36:14.489 --> 36:16.957
Atta girl.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.131
<i>As I looked at myself</i>
<i>in the mirror,</i>

36:24.133 --> 36:27.251
<i>I realized</i>
<i>I wasn't over Sebastian.</i>

36:27.253 --> 36:28.936
<i>And if I just went</i>
<i>and hooked up with someone</i>

36:28.938 --> 36:32.673
<i>to prove something,</i>
<i>then I truly would be a loser...</i>

36:32.675 --> 36:35.393
<i>One who had lost herself.</i>

36:35.395 --> 36:37.173
<i>And I may have lost</i>
<i>my mother's purse</i>

36:37.293 --> 36:40.464
<i>and my boyfriend,</i>
<i>but I still had me,</i>

36:40.466 --> 36:42.483
<i>and I was still</i>
<i>my mother's daughter.</i>

36:42.485 --> 36:43.601
I'm sorry.

36:43.603 --> 36:46.237
I can't go with you.

36:46.239 --> 36:47.638
I'm still in love
with Sebastian,

36:47.640 --> 36:50.057
and being with someone else
isn't gonna change that.

36:50.059 --> 36:53.628
You're in love with the guy.
Yeah, can't help you there.

36:53.630 --> 36:54.996
Good luck with that.

36:54.998 --> 36:56.430
Okay, well, if it's okay,

36:56.432 --> 36:58.165
I think I'm just
gonna crash here.

36:58.167 --> 36:59.984
I'm pretty exhausted.

36:59.986 --> 37:01.335
Sure. Of course.

37:01.337 --> 37:03.754
I'm gonna head back to the bar.
You gonna be okay?

37:03.756 --> 37:05.206
I think so.

37:05.208 --> 37:06.791
Hey, thanks for breaking me in.

37:06.793 --> 37:09.343
Anytime.

37:09.345 --> 37:11.212
Where are you going?

37:11.214 --> 37:12.263
Back the way I came.

37:12.265 --> 37:13.831
You can just use
the front door.

37:13.833 --> 37:15.600
I like a little adventure.

37:15.602 --> 37:17.001
