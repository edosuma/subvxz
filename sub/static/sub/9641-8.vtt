00:08.757 --> 00:10.866
Sorry, I think
you dropped this.

00:10.900 --> 00:11.970
No. That's not mine.

00:12.004 --> 00:13.104
Yeah, I know.

00:13.138 --> 00:16.104
I needed an excuse
to come and talk to you.

00:23.038 --> 00:25.172
It's quite lovely...

00:25.206 --> 00:27.005
What you're
working on there.

00:30.139 --> 00:33.304
So, new British guy,

00:33.338 --> 00:36.905
How close are the countries
British and England?

00:36.939 --> 00:39.038
They're the same country.

00:39.072 --> 00:42.372
Kind of. And it's
"Britain", not "British".

00:42.407 --> 00:43.938
I know. I just
think it's hilarious

00:43.973 --> 00:46.839
When people explain
ridiculous things.

00:48.540 --> 00:50.840
Speaking of
ridiculous things...

00:50.874 --> 00:55.343
Ok, holster your
brushes, hombres.

00:55.377 --> 00:58.743
I trust you brought something
new to compete in the art off.

01:01.079 --> 01:03.279
Finkle. Macgruder.

01:04.712 --> 01:06.912
It's time to art off.

01:06.947 --> 01:10.748
Art off is stupid. Just because Mr. Laritate
picks a painting doesn't mean it's good.

01:10.782 --> 01:13.649
I mean, look at him.
He picks out those clothes.

01:13.683 --> 01:17.017
He doesn't pick those.
His mum lays them out for him.

01:17.052 --> 01:20.052
Oh, I like you,
new British guy.

01:20.086 --> 01:22.253
You're on my team.

01:22.287 --> 01:23.987
My name is
Mason Greybeck.

01:25.621 --> 01:28.889
Mason Greybeck... That sounds like
the name of a game show host.

01:28.923 --> 01:31.723
Like, Mason Greybeck, I'll take
"Bridges" for a thousand, please.

01:31.757 --> 01:34.258
Your question is,

01:34.292 --> 01:37.759
"I think you're cute.
What do you think of me?"

01:39.561 --> 01:41.461
We're out of time.

01:44.197 --> 01:47.097
Ready. Set. Art off!

01:48.566 --> 01:52.000
Well, sailboat plus
moon, plus owl

01:52.034 --> 01:53.467
equals mystery.

01:53.502 --> 01:54.801
But...

01:56.303 --> 01:59.404
12 kittens beats mystery.
The kittens have it!

01:59.438 --> 02:02.639
Sailboat plus moon
equals loser.

02:08.143 --> 02:10.043
You know, since I got
here last Thursday,

02:10.077 --> 02:13.410
I've noticed that he talks like
a cowboy. And he likes cats.

02:13.444 --> 02:15.779
In America, we call
them kitty cats.

02:15.813 --> 02:18.747
Ok, kitty cats.

02:18.782 --> 02:21.649
I made you
say "kitty cats".

02:25.586 --> 02:28.419
How would you feel about
maybe going for some tea later?

02:28.453 --> 02:31.554
Then you can make me say all
kinds of things that make you laugh.

02:32.856 --> 02:36.390
Ok, but if "go for tea"
doesn't mean a date,

02:36.425 --> 02:38.825
then I'm going to be
really embarrassed.

02:38.860 --> 02:42.561
And that whole accent thing...
Girls see right through it.

02:42.595 --> 02:43.895
No, they don't.

02:46.465 --> 02:48.899
Oh, kittens never lose.

02:48.933 --> 02:52.168
Next time I'm gonna paint
Macgruder being eaten by a kitten.

02:53.804 --> 02:56.038
He's gonna
drop this class.

03:58.212 --> 04:01.547
Justin, hey, look!
The recliner's fixed.

04:01.581 --> 04:03.514
Now, I am one step closer

04:03.549 --> 04:06.249
to having a place to sleep
in every room in the house.

04:07.950 --> 04:10.683
Dad, I've looked for the mummy
everywhere and I can't find him.

04:12.519 --> 04:15.487
- I'm never gonna get Juliet back.
- Out looking for the mummy?

04:15.521 --> 04:18.322
You can't do that by yourself.
It's dangerous.

04:18.356 --> 04:20.156
You need special training.

04:20.190 --> 04:23.058
Now, mummies are slow
but they're sneaky,

04:23.092 --> 04:25.059
like your mother in heels.

04:25.093 --> 04:27.293
Dad! Where am I going
to get special training?

04:27.327 --> 04:29.686
All the monster huve
been destroyed.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.936
Justin, I think you've
reached an age

04:33.971 --> 04:36.737
when a father can
proudly train his own son,

04:36.772 --> 04:39.773
so that that father never
again has to risk his own life.

04:41.809 --> 04:43.977
All right. Ok.
Thanks, dad.

04:44.011 --> 04:47.112
I mean, I know you haven't always
been ok with me dating a vampire,

04:47.147 --> 04:49.448
but I'm glad you're gonna
help me train to find her.

04:49.482 --> 04:51.581
Well, when you're
raising wizards,

04:51.615 --> 04:58.343
you've to deal with your son dating monsters
and a whole your kids turns out normal.

04:58.378 --> 05:00.870
I mean... That's me, right?

05:03.060 --> 05:07.435
Dad, my dable wand isn't
collapsing. See it? Just...

05:07.470 --> 05:08.438
Now don't work.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.300
Yeah, you're still the normal.

05:21.400 --> 05:25.100
So that's why afternoon
tea is a British tradition.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.000
See, I can tell this is fancy,
because my drink isn't fizzing.

05:33.500 --> 05:37.900
Okay, now it's my turn to show
you an American tradition.

05:40.297 --> 05:41.767
These are water balloons.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.200
So you've heard of them.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.354
Here's how Americans.

05:50.108 --> 05:52.143
All right. Victim in sight.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.996
And... Bombs away.
Hide!

06:02.054 --> 06:03.788
Ok. Your turn.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.474
I'd love to,
but it seems rude.

06:06.508 --> 06:09.294
No. That's the part
that makes it American.

06:10.346 --> 06:12.447
Here. I'll show you
how to do it.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.369
Now what do I do?

06:19.405 --> 06:21.056
Just drop it.

06:23.125 --> 06:25.410
<i>Hey! I see you two!</i>

06:28.680 --> 06:29.848
We should run.

06:30.466 --> 06:31.550
No...

06:32.185 --> 06:34.736
We should have
a romantic montage.

07:29.610 --> 07:32.329
All right, that should get
our relationship started.

07:47.178 --> 07:48.478
Max, I need your help.

07:48.713 --> 07:51.081
When Justin comes
down, attack him.

07:51.115 --> 07:54.101
Done. Don't know why,
don't care. Going with it.

07:54.135 --> 07:57.271
We're helping him to
train to fight a mummy.

07:57.305 --> 07:58.756
Dad, I honestly
don't care why.

08:00.174 --> 08:01.575
Dad!

08:01.910 --> 08:05.028
Dad, I'm ready
to start my training.

08:05.263 --> 08:07.781
Good. Ok.
We'll...

08:07.815 --> 08:09.983
...Start with a little...
Now!

08:10.018 --> 08:12.186
I'm the mummy!
I'm the mummy!

08:13.688 --> 08:16.374
- What? Stop!
- I got him!

08:19.961 --> 08:21.429
That's enough!

08:21.463 --> 08:23.214
- Calm down. Ok...
- Why?!

08:25.400 --> 08:27.600
I'm sorry, Justin. I just
wanted you to see,

08:27.700 --> 08:30.038
how difficult this is
gonna be. But don't worry.

08:30.072 --> 08:32.890
'Cause I got something
that's really gonna help.

08:35.412 --> 08:37.514
New no-slip shoes!

08:37.548 --> 08:40.268
Thanks, dad.
You're good. You are good.

08:40.302 --> 08:43.004
No, no, no. They're magical
rear-view goggles.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.591
When you put 'em on you can
see everything behind you.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.427
You can fight the mummy,
look him in the eye,

08:47.462 --> 08:49.630
And not get turned into
one of his minions.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.655
Wow. I can see
everything behind me.

08:57.689 --> 09:00.157
Max, wherever you are,
you'd better stay there.

09:00.192 --> 09:02.533
'Cause I'm a-come getcha,
and I'm gonna attack you.

09:06.792 --> 09:08.108
Why are you moving?

09:11.200 --> 09:13.356
Maybe you'll be the
normal one after all.

09:13.869 --> 09:16.684
Dad, come on!
I lost that race years ago.

09:18.696 --> 09:20.253
We have so much in common.

09:20.280 --> 09:24.263
I mean, we both like painting,
and drawing, and sculpting.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.257
- We're the perfect art couple.
- Oh, my gosh!

09:27.292 --> 09:29.857
You guys are the couple other
couples come to for advice.

09:29.892 --> 09:31.928
We're gonna be
together forever.

09:33.133 --> 09:35.856
Oh, wow! Check out this
train wreck on canvas.

09:38.354 --> 09:41.108
We'll give you ten bucks for
your stupid yankee poodle dandy.

09:41.143 --> 09:44.009
- Alex!
- Oh, sorry.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.805
Twenty bucks.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.687
Why are you buying that
if you don't like it?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.095
Because I know Mason,

09:50.130 --> 09:51.738
and he's gonna think
it's hilarious.

09:51.773 --> 09:55.876
Buying art to make each other
laugh is what art couples do, Harper.

10:07.487 --> 10:09.454
Hey, Mason.
Check it out.

10:09.489 --> 10:12.257
I just bought the most horrible,
ridiculous painting ever

10:12.291 --> 10:14.057
and I'm gonna volunteer
it in the art off.

10:14.092 --> 10:17.226
I think it's gonna be something
we both find hilarious.

10:17.261 --> 10:19.528
Well, I've got something
to show you, too.

10:19.562 --> 10:21.463
I was up all night
working on this,

10:21.497 --> 10:23.098
and I think it's
one of my best.

10:23.132 --> 10:25.165
Oh, my gosh!

10:25.200 --> 10:28.067
An unveiling in front of the
whole class will be so romantic.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.171
Or Mason and I can
just show each other now.

10:32.205 --> 10:34.507
Don't rob me of my part
of this romance.

10:38.345 --> 10:41.980
Who's ready to face off
in today's... Art off?

10:43.949 --> 10:46.684
Ah, a Russo

10:46.718 --> 10:49.786
versus our friend
from across the pond.

10:49.821 --> 10:51.288
Or as I like to call it:

10:51.322 --> 10:54.023
"The revolutionary war
part deux?"

10:57.127 --> 11:00.930
Ready... Set...

11:00.964 --> 11:02.164
Art off!

11:04.600 --> 11:06.601
Somebody flush the toilet.

11:06.636 --> 11:09.204
We got a stinker over here.

11:09.238 --> 11:11.839
Calamity Jane!

11:11.873 --> 11:13.440
We have identical themes.

11:13.474 --> 11:16.209
The revolutionary
war and dogs.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.212
Oh, my gosh!

11:19.246 --> 11:22.516
You bought the worst painting
you could find, too?

11:22.550 --> 11:25.418
We are the best
art couple ever.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.419
No, Alex, you're making
fun of my painting,

11:27.454 --> 11:29.287
and I worked on it all night.

11:30.989 --> 11:35.960
Then that means I just called your
painting horrible and ridiculous.

11:36.996 --> 11:39.963
You also said it
belongs in the toilet.

11:53.348 --> 11:55.682
Ok, I know that my
laughing seems rude,

11:55.717 --> 11:58.284
but, you see,
in America,

11:58.318 --> 12:00.886
laughter is how we
show our appreciation.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.888
Like, "Mr. Laritate
is a great teacher".

12:06.325 --> 12:09.359
Or, or, "Harper, that's
a great outfit".

12:15.565 --> 12:16.798
Alex, I know you,

12:16.833 --> 12:19.567
and I know you don't believe
either of those things are true.

12:19.601 --> 12:22.635
I think she believes one
of those things is true.

12:22.670 --> 12:25.404
Sorry, Mr. Laritate.

12:26.739 --> 12:28.673
You know why
you don't like it?

12:28.707 --> 12:30.741
Because you don't
understand it.

12:30.776 --> 12:34.444
There's your shovel.
Start digging your way out.

12:34.479 --> 12:36.946
Yeah, I,
I don't get it.

12:36.981 --> 12:39.782
Can you explain it to me?
Any part of it?

12:39.816 --> 12:43.017
It's not "Betsy Ross,"
it's "Barksy Ross".

12:44.386 --> 12:45.920
You see,
that's what I do.

12:45.955 --> 12:48.456
I take famous moments
in American history

12:48.490 --> 12:51.926
and I imagine what they would be like
from the point of view of canines,

12:51.960 --> 12:55.495
because I'm in love
with America. And dogs.

12:57.298 --> 13:00.169
Oh! Now I get it.

13:00.203 --> 13:02.804
Yeah. What an
amazing painting.

13:02.839 --> 13:04.873
I'm so glad you like it.

13:04.908 --> 13:08.106
See, now you get it. You just
had to look a little deeper.

13:10.675 --> 13:12.142
This is so great,

13:12.176 --> 13:14.410
because I had an idea
for my next piece.

13:14.445 --> 13:17.180
I'm going to paint
a portrait of you.

13:17.214 --> 13:21.317
It will be your face as
a cute teacup chihuahua.

13:24.087 --> 13:28.590
Sewing the stars and stripes,
as if you were Betsy Ross.

13:30.827 --> 13:32.161
No, no...

13:32.195 --> 13:34.463
You, you don't
have to do that.

13:34.497 --> 13:36.731
Nobody needs to see
me as a dog, really.

13:36.766 --> 13:38.833
Dogs are my muse, Alex.

13:38.868 --> 13:41.069
And I've already got
the image in my head.

13:41.104 --> 13:43.905
I've got to get
going on this.

13:45.974 --> 13:48.742
Well, this is just great.

13:48.777 --> 13:51.376
My new boyfriend is gonna
paint me as a dog.

13:51.411 --> 13:54.510
Not only that. Mr. Laritate
gives all the art off winners

13:54.544 --> 13:56.076
a special page
in the yearbook.

13:56.111 --> 13:57.811
Maybe we could have
back-to-back pages.

13:57.845 --> 14:00.546
Me with my kitten paintings
and you with your dog face.

14:05.885 --> 14:07.251
Ok, then.

14:21.298 --> 14:23.799
- Hey, Justin!
- Hey, dad. Check me out.

14:23.834 --> 14:28.403
I am really getting the hang
of this thing. I'm making tea!

14:28.438 --> 14:30.539
- Terrific, son.
- Yep.

14:30.573 --> 14:33.675
- You must be feeling pretty proud
of yourself. - Yeah, I actually...

14:33.709 --> 14:36.777
Dad, what is with the...
The hat?

14:36.811 --> 14:38.111
It's kind of distracting.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.579
Oh, really?

14:39.613 --> 14:41.380
I'm not trying to
distract you at all.

14:41.415 --> 14:44.150
Not trying to
distract you at all.

14:48.186 --> 14:50.254
- Sneak attack!
- Judo trick!

14:53.891 --> 14:55.391
- Give up? Give up?
- No!

14:55.426 --> 14:57.458
The question is,
do you give up?

14:57.493 --> 14:59.260
I'm on top of you!

14:59.294 --> 15:01.061
Yes. I beg to
differ, though.

15:01.096 --> 15:04.230
Because in some countries,
I'm on top of you!

15:05.699 --> 15:07.733
That was awesome, son!

15:09.403 --> 15:12.104
As soon as the goggles became
a hindrance, I ripped them off.

15:12.138 --> 15:15.574
Yeah, because some people think
because they have them on,

15:15.608 --> 15:18.443
they have to keep them on.
But they don't.

15:18.478 --> 15:19.978
Good hunting, son.

15:20.013 --> 15:21.980
Thanks, dad.

15:22.014 --> 15:25.215
Hey, man, can I borrow
those goggles you have?

15:25.250 --> 15:27.451
They're for biology class.

15:27.485 --> 15:29.753
I'm gonna use them to
cheat on the kid behind me.

15:31.755 --> 15:33.588
You know they'll be
kind of obvious.

15:34.222 --> 15:37.257
I know. That's why
I'm gonna wear the hat.

15:40.927 --> 15:41.994
Goggles.

15:51.437 --> 15:53.304
Hey, Harper!

15:53.338 --> 15:56.274
I figured out a way to stop Mason
from painting that picture of me.

15:56.808 --> 15:59.276
A magic shell.

15:59.311 --> 16:03.846
I blow through this shell and I become
the artistic muse for whoever hears it.

16:03.881 --> 16:07.149
He'll want to paint me as me,
instead of a chihuahua.

16:07.684 --> 16:11.553
But chihuahuas are so cute.

16:11.587 --> 16:14.856
Well, I hope I'm cuter than
a dog that lives in a purse.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.025
For once, I'm gonna fix a
problem before it is a problem.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.861
Look, you barely got out of
trouble with him yesterday.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.663
Don't make it worse
by adding magic.

16:22.697 --> 16:25.432
Just take it on the chin, let him
paint you as a pooch, and move on.

16:28.536 --> 16:31.704
Hello, brown eyes. Ready
to be my doggie model?

16:33.873 --> 16:36.808
Just one second.
My allergies are acting up.

16:44.615 --> 16:46.983
I just had a
most splendid idea.

16:47.017 --> 16:48.684
I was pretty
sure you might.

16:50.987 --> 16:54.321
Don't you see what you've done? You
used magic to make your relationship ok.

16:54.356 --> 16:55.989
I don't think that's right.

16:56.024 --> 16:59.258
Harper, doing what's right
has never really been my goal.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.293
Come in!

17:02.861 --> 17:04.663
There you are, my love!

17:04.698 --> 17:06.467
I've finished!

17:08.337 --> 17:11.939
All of these are of you.

17:11.973 --> 17:13.573
I don't know which
one's my favorite,

17:13.608 --> 17:17.009
but they're all good.

17:20.346 --> 17:21.912
They're beautiful.

17:21.946 --> 17:24.446
And the moment I
started I couldn't stop.

17:24.481 --> 17:28.150
When I paint you, something
just comes over me.

17:28.185 --> 17:30.919
It feels... It feels...

17:30.953 --> 17:33.587
Magical?

17:33.622 --> 17:35.756
Yes! Magical.

17:35.790 --> 17:37.800
Did you hear that? I'm sure
there's not just these,

17:37.900 --> 17:40.600
probably hundreds
and hundreds of...

17:42.595 --> 17:44.395
And there they are.

17:47.898 --> 17:49.733
Hey, it's you again!

17:49.767 --> 17:51.235
Is it Martin or Jason?

17:51.269 --> 17:52.603
It's Mason.

17:52.838 --> 17:55.808
Wasn't that one
of the choices?

17:55.842 --> 17:59.044
Oh wow, these are great.

18:00.013 --> 18:01.813
You can hardly
see the numbers.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.187
Alex is my muse.
My inspiration.

18:10.221 --> 18:12.322
All I want to do
is paint her.

18:12.956 --> 18:16.458
Yep. It's like he's
under her spell.

18:16.493 --> 18:17.793
Yes!

18:17.827 --> 18:19.261
I only wish
I could paint Alex

18:19.295 --> 18:21.929
on a bigger canvas.

18:21.964 --> 18:24.130
And I think
I've got an idea.

18:24.165 --> 18:26.166
Excuse me.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.735
I think I've got
an idea, too.

18:28.769 --> 18:32.438
- You stole my muse shell.
- That's exactly what she did.

18:32.973 --> 18:35.975
Oh, big deal. I like him,
and he likes painting me.

18:36.010 --> 18:38.077
I'll tell you what
the big deal is.

18:38.111 --> 18:40.812
Pretty soon he's not going
to be able to eat or sleep.

18:40.846 --> 18:43.948
All he's gonna want
to do is paint you.

18:43.982 --> 18:46.651
Sounds like it wasn't
the right thing to do.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.686
Dad, I had to do it.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.321
He paints dogs in
American history.

18:52.855 --> 18:54.422
Those are terrible.

18:54.657 --> 18:57.326
Well, I hate those paintings
too, that's why I did it.

18:57.361 --> 19:01.229
- Listen, honey, if you really
like Jason... - Mason.

19:01.264 --> 19:03.899
I said that.

19:03.933 --> 19:06.601
Then it shouldn't matter
what kind of an artist he is.

19:06.635 --> 19:09.202
It should only matter
what kind of person he is.

19:09.437 --> 19:11.438
As a great poet once said,

19:11.472 --> 19:14.907
"Don't go changin'
to try to please me."

19:17.076 --> 19:19.644
Mr. Russo, are you
quoting Billy Joel?

19:21.179 --> 19:22.747
I've never heard
of that person.

19:33.925 --> 19:36.559
What are you looking at?
Oh! This is trouble.

19:38.662 --> 19:40.496
That shell's already
turned him wacky.

19:41.030 --> 19:43.999
Wacky? Come on!
It's beautiful.

19:44.033 --> 19:46.067
It just... Oh, fine!

19:50.872 --> 19:53.474
What do you think?
Do you like it?

19:55.176 --> 19:58.044
It's, it's great.
It's really great.

19:58.078 --> 20:01.314
That's so good because
I really want you to like it.

20:01.648 --> 20:04.817
You are beautiful, and I'm
going to keep painting you.

20:06.653 --> 20:09.820
Well, why don't you take a break
and we can go get a sandwich?

20:09.854 --> 20:11.821
No time for eating!

20:13.790 --> 20:17.226
Right there. The light
is hitting you perfectly.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.896
I want to do a bigger chalk
drawing of you over here,

20:20.930 --> 20:24.632
in profile. Excuse me.
Move! Thank you.

20:29.104 --> 20:32.773
So, is this what you're just
gonna be doing from now on?

20:33.108 --> 20:34.807
I hope so.

20:34.842 --> 20:37.443
We're the ultimate
art couple.

20:40.147 --> 20:41.613
We need to get inside.

20:41.948 --> 20:46.517
No, I have to redraw
this as it washes away.

20:46.552 --> 20:50.219
The more it washes away,
the faster I have to draw.

20:50.254 --> 20:52.788
Ok, that is just wacky.

21:03.831 --> 21:05.465
Are you ok?

21:05.499 --> 21:07.834
Sounds like you've got
a bit of a chest cold.

21:07.868 --> 21:11.170
We need to get you out
of this rain and inside.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.640
Well... Wait!

21:16.176 --> 21:17.543
So you're done
drawing me?

21:18.077 --> 21:21.213
Yeah, I feel like
painting some dogs.

21:21.248 --> 21:23.715
Good. Good!
You should do that.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.620
But kiss me first.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.522
But you have a cold.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.358
Just kiss me.

22:00.825 --> 22:03.360
Hey, monster guy!

22:05.396 --> 22:06.763
You may have
noticed that lately

22:06.797 --> 22:09.331
I've been acting like I totally
don't know what's going on.

22:10.733 --> 22:13.335
- Lately?
- So you noticed.

22:13.369 --> 22:16.104
Great! Yeah, like,

22:16.139 --> 22:19.541
like remember when I let all
those monsters out of that book?

22:19.576 --> 22:21.509
Yeah. They all escaped,

22:21.544 --> 22:24.544
and destroyed the rest of
the monster hunters but me.

22:24.579 --> 22:26.614
Yeah, that's not
the worst part.

22:28.148 --> 22:32.251
One of those monsters was the
mummy who stole your girlfriend.

22:32.285 --> 22:34.886
So, I mean, I guess,
technically,

22:34.920 --> 22:37.088
You can be mad at me.

22:38.022 --> 22:39.522
You know...

22:41.393 --> 22:43.894
- That reminds me of
something. - Yeah?

22:43.928 --> 22:46.295
- Something I have to do.
- Okay.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.900
And I need your help.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.500
Yes, great, because I here
for you. Whatever you need!

22:51.700 --> 22:52.900
- Good.
- Yeah.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.600
Snake attack!
