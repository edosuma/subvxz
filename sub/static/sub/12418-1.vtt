WEBVTT

01:05.752 --> 01:07.219
Uh.

01:09.823 --> 01:11.222
Dito.

01:12.059 --> 01:13.458
Uh.

01:14.461 --> 01:16.292
Oh, my goodness.

01:16.363 --> 01:20.322
I can't believe
to hear your voice
on this machine.

01:21.034 --> 01:22.592
It's your mother.

01:25.005 --> 01:28.168
Dito, I called
your friend Nerf to call you.

01:28.242 --> 01:30.642
He's a good kid.
Uh--

01:33.013 --> 01:34.412
I don't know
what else to do.

01:34.481 --> 01:36.608
Your father's sick.
He's real sick,

01:36.683 --> 01:39.151
and he won't go
to the hospital.
You know how he is,

01:39.219 --> 01:43.121
and I'm sorry.
I don't know
what else to do.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.184
Your friend Nerf, uh,

01:47.928 --> 01:52.331
he's a good kid, you know.
He said he'd pick you up
at the airport if you came.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.364
I know that it's far.

01:56.303 --> 01:58.032
I'm sorry.

02:00.140 --> 02:02.199
I, uh--

02:02.276 --> 02:04.836
I'm gonna hang up
now, Dito.

02:04.912 --> 02:06.243
Okay.
I love you.

02:06.313 --> 02:09.544
No matter what you do,
I love you.

02:34.975 --> 02:40.743
<i>Tonight we have the author
of a wonderful,
wonderful book.</i>

02:40.814 --> 02:44.841
<i>A Guide to Recognizing
Your Saints.
Dito Montiel.</i>

02:48.555 --> 02:49.852
Thanks.

03:21.154 --> 03:23.452
<i>By the end
of all this, Giuseppe,</i>

03:23.523 --> 03:26.185
<i>his brother Antonio
used to call him "Little Sister"</i>

03:26.326 --> 03:29.659
<i>'cause he slept with Noxzema
on his face every night.</i>

03:29.730 --> 03:33.166
<i>It never even made sense,
being everything else
about him was a mess.</i>

03:33.233 --> 03:36.202
<i>Well, he loved
the face cream, you know?</i>

03:36.737 --> 03:39.467
<i>Anyway, Giuseppe,
he's gonna be dead.</i>

03:39.539 --> 03:41.370
<i>Yeah, I know.
It sucks.</i>

03:41.441 --> 03:44.342
<i>There'll be another guy
you'll meet too,
same with him.</i>

03:44.411 --> 03:46.811
<i>And then another little boy.</i>

03:46.880 --> 03:50.111
<i>He's gonna die, too.
What a mess, huh?</i>

03:50.183 --> 03:55.485
And I don't even know why
I feel I gotta tell you this
up front but I do.

03:55.555 --> 03:57.887
And don't worry, like,

03:59.393 --> 04:03.659
I'm not giving away
any big ending, you know,
with this.

04:03.730 --> 04:06.358
A whole lot of other shit's
gotta happen first.

04:09.403 --> 04:12.634
But I just, uh,
I wanna remember

04:14.875 --> 04:17.435
who these people are
and what they meant to me.

04:19.446 --> 04:20.777
What they mean to me.

04:20.846 --> 04:23.338
And they are real.

04:49.276 --> 04:50.868
My name's Dito.

04:54.481 --> 04:57.006
I'm gonna leave everybody
in this film.

05:05.392 --> 05:09.158
<i>I see Laurie's and Diane's
walkin' down 31st Street.</i>

05:09.229 --> 05:11.163
<i>Hot pink leg warmers.</i>

05:11.231 --> 05:13.893
<i>Red, white and blue
roach clip feathered earrings.</i>

05:13.967 --> 05:17.232
<i>"The Song Remains the Same"

of their jackets.</i>

05:17.304 --> 05:19.829
<i>And they wanna know,
"Yo, Dito, you Rock or Disco?"</i>

05:21.074 --> 05:24.805
<i>What the fuck?
You fuckin' idiot!</i>

05:24.878 --> 05:28.279
<i>I see innocent Giuseppe's
walking down the streets</i>

05:28.348 --> 05:30.873
<i>where Puerto Ricans
still listen to Journey.</i>

05:32.753 --> 05:34.345
Dito, what's up, man?

05:34.421 --> 05:37.083
<i>Really, It's true.
Puerto Ricans
listen to Journey.</i>

05:37.791 --> 05:40.123
Yo, Steve Perry's
the shit, bro!

05:40.827 --> 05:42.021
<i>Antonio!</i>

05:42.095 --> 05:44.620
<i>When this place
isn't covered in violence,</i>

05:44.698 --> 05:48.134
<i>That's where the fuckin' shit

05:48.201 --> 05:49.691
<i>And even sometimes
when it is,</i>

05:49.770 --> 05:52.534
You're drinking it
like an idiot.

05:52.606 --> 05:54.369
You taking a bath
and shit, man.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.806
<i>this place is heaven.</i>

05:55.876 --> 05:57.309
Get the fuck off him!

05:57.377 --> 06:00.141
Whoa, whoa.

06:00.213 --> 06:01.874
Stop, stop, stop!

06:01.948 --> 06:04.314
What's wrong with you?
What the fuck?

06:06.520 --> 06:08.613
What the fuck is that?

06:08.688 --> 06:11.680
<i>Motherfucker sounds
like he's prayin' and shit.</i>

06:11.758 --> 06:14.124
Yes.
Praying and shit, huh?

06:19.699 --> 06:21.667
Oh, ladies.

06:21.735 --> 06:26.172
Uh, which one of you
wanna suck,
suck me off first?

06:26.239 --> 06:27.968
You?
You?

06:28.041 --> 06:29.804
You ain't got shit!

06:31.111 --> 06:33.204
What about that?

06:37.150 --> 06:39.880
It's cute.
I like it.

06:39.953 --> 06:42.319
You got it.

06:44.825 --> 06:46.952
Hey, clean this shit up, too.

06:49.696 --> 06:52.426
Hey yo, check it out.
I wrote "Bruce Lee" up there.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.967
<i>Nerf, you climbed
all the way up there?</i>

06:55.769 --> 06:58.533
What are you,
a fuckin' stupid, man?

06:58.605 --> 07:00.402
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

07:02.142 --> 07:06.670
Yo, that's fucked up.
Somebody wrote some shit
on your house, man.

07:07.013 --> 07:08.674
<i>Reaper, he's from Queensbridge.</i>

07:08.949 --> 07:10.940
<i>They wrote Satan and shit
all over the church, too.</i>

07:13.787 --> 07:14.776
Hey, Dito.

07:14.855 --> 07:17.187
It's so hot outside.
You got out, yet?

07:17.257 --> 07:20.852
<i>Tell him it's hot
because it's summer, you know.</i>

07:20.927 --> 07:25.057
Antonio, come in.
Look at you guys.
You're filthy.

07:25.132 --> 07:26.360
<i>You want juice?</i>

07:26.433 --> 07:28.799
Yeah, give me a juice.
Hey, look who's here.

07:28.869 --> 07:30.461
Antonio, what's going on?

07:30.537 --> 07:35.099
Are you fixin'--
What are you doing?

07:35.175 --> 07:38.201
<i>Could you keep it down
down there?</i>

07:38.278 --> 07:39.677
Hello!
Could you please--

07:39.746 --> 07:41.646
Do you want me
to say somethin' to 'em?

07:41.715 --> 07:43.910
No, it's okay.
No. It's alright.

07:43.984 --> 07:45.679
Come on in.

07:45.752 --> 07:49.779
<i>Giuseppe, sit down.
Good to see you.
Antonio, where you been lately?</i>

07:49.856 --> 07:51.653
What do you mean?
I've been around.

07:51.725 --> 07:53.955
<i>I haven't seen you
at the handball courts.</i>

07:54.027 --> 07:56.257
<i>You guys getting tired
of getting beat, huh?</i>

07:56.329 --> 07:59.526
<i>Dito didn't tell you
we been at the Boys club,
boxing?</i>

07:59.599 --> 08:01.499
They got the Golden Gloves
coming up.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.502
The only thing
you'll ever box
is oranges.

08:03.570 --> 08:06.403
Dad, this is serious.
They got bags and everything.

08:06.473 --> 08:07.770
It's cheap.
$10.

08:07.841 --> 08:10.401
$10. Where you guys
gonna get $10 from?

08:10.477 --> 08:12.069
It's just $10.

08:12.145 --> 08:14.773
<i>You guys wanna be
Golden Gloves?
You learn from the best.</i>

08:14.848 --> 08:18.181
Up from the waist,
down from the chin.
That's Golden Gloves.

08:18.251 --> 08:20.276
Okay.
Stop it already.
Seriously.

08:20.353 --> 08:22.480
You're serious?
Come here.

08:22.556 --> 08:23.614
<i>Shake my hand.</i>

08:23.690 --> 08:25.282
I'm glad to meet you.
Serious.

08:25.358 --> 08:29.294
<i>That's a funny joke
if I was five years old.
Stop it.</i>

08:29.362 --> 08:31.091
The joke is five years old.

08:31.164 --> 08:32.654
Antonio, how old
is this guy?

08:32.732 --> 08:34.996
He's serious.
I don't know
how old he is.

08:35.068 --> 08:37.696
What happened to your nose?
It's bleeding.

08:37.770 --> 08:40.102
It's my father.
He's stupid.
Whatever.

08:40.173 --> 08:42.299
Don't say that
about your father.

08:42.375 --> 08:45.867
Hand him a dish rag.
Wipe his nose there.
What's the matter with him?

08:46.546 --> 08:48.480
<i>Are you alright?
Are you getting a job?</i>

08:48.548 --> 08:50.277
What are you doing
with your life?

08:50.350 --> 08:52.318
Yeah, for sure.
I'm doing--

08:52.385 --> 08:54.444
Yeah, you're not doing anything.

08:54.521 --> 08:57.752
You wanna be boxers.
Forget about
these Golden Gloves.

08:57.824 --> 09:00.452
<i>You wanna learn?
You come to me,
'cause I'm the king.</i>

09:00.527 --> 09:02.961
And the king
sits right here.

09:03.029 --> 09:05.896
Monty's throne, right?
Monty's throne.

09:05.966 --> 09:08.230
I'm the king.

09:08.301 --> 09:10.292
I'm gonna get up.
I'm gonna show you--

09:10.370 --> 09:11.735
Are gonna get up?
What?

09:11.805 --> 09:14.467
<i>I'm gonna show him.
I'm going to show you
the left hook.</i>

09:14.541 --> 09:16.065
<i>I'm gonna show you
that left hook.</i>

09:16.142 --> 09:19.236
Bye, Mom.
Antonio, come on.
Antonio!

09:19.312 --> 09:20.711
Alright, man.
Come on.

09:20.780 --> 09:22.680
<i>Antonio, come on!</i>

09:22.749 --> 09:25.741
<i>Where you going?
What's the matter with him?</i>

09:25.819 --> 09:28.185
What's the matter?
Where you going?

09:28.255 --> 09:31.224
<i>He wants to go.
Giuseppe, come on, man.</i>

09:31.291 --> 09:32.485
<i>Say good bye.</i>

09:32.559 --> 09:35.084
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it very much.

09:35.161 --> 09:37.129
It was a pleasure
talking to you.

09:37.197 --> 09:38.459
Thank you very much.

09:38.531 --> 09:41.625
That kid doesn't say
two words.
It scares me that kid.

09:41.701 --> 09:44.499
Antonio?
Tonight I want you
to come back.

09:44.571 --> 09:47.802
<i>I want you to have dinner
with Dito and the family,
alright?</i>

09:47.874 --> 09:49.705
<i>You take care
of that nose kid.</i>

09:49.776 --> 09:51.073
Absolutely.

09:52.579 --> 09:53.944
Yeah.

09:54.848 --> 09:55.872
They're alright.

09:57.284 --> 09:58.683
They're alright.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.146
Good dancing.

10:03.223 --> 10:04.554
Look who we got here.

10:04.624 --> 10:06.956
Oh, shit!
Friggin' pistachio dick.

10:07.027 --> 10:08.119
<i>Look at these girls.</i>

10:08.194 --> 10:09.855
It curves like a banana, right?

10:09.929 --> 10:12.227
No, like a pistachio.

10:12.299 --> 10:14.199
Do you want some?
You.

10:28.581 --> 10:30.845
<i>It's as hot
as a fuckin' oven in here.</i>

10:38.058 --> 10:42.392
Get the fuck off me!
It's like 250 degrees.
Get off me.

10:42.462 --> 10:45.556
I feel like a piece
of roast beef.

10:45.632 --> 10:48.226
But look at me.
I'm fuckin' sticky.
Look at me.

10:48.301 --> 10:49.962
So?

10:50.036 --> 10:54.632
Fuckin' landlord's
got the fuckin' radiators on
in the summer.

10:56.509 --> 10:59.376
You better not fuckin'
cum in me.

11:03.583 --> 11:04.641
No!

11:04.718 --> 11:06.709
Don't fuck.

11:06.786 --> 11:10.483
You better not fuckin'
cum in me.

11:13.927 --> 11:17.658
Fuck!

11:17.731 --> 11:18.857
What the fuck?

11:18.932 --> 11:20.991
Fuckin' radiator burned me
and shit!

11:21.067 --> 11:22.659
Fuck me.

11:22.736 --> 11:23.794
Come here.

11:23.870 --> 11:27.135
You want me to come over there
and give you a hug
or some shit?

11:27.207 --> 11:28.902
<i>I don't want you
to fuckin' hug me.</i>

11:28.975 --> 11:32.877
Look what we got here.
You guys are two
naughty fuckers.

11:32.946 --> 11:34.174
Who the fuck is this guy?

11:34.247 --> 11:35.646
<i>My little retarded sister.</i>

11:35.715 --> 11:38.240
You're the bitch
who works at the pool
with Diane.

11:38.318 --> 11:40.650
I just got done
fuckin' her.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.187
Get the fuck
out of here.

11:42.255 --> 11:46.385
I'm virile and I'm virile
and I'm virile,
and I'm ready to do that shit.

11:46.459 --> 11:48.654
I just stole this dildo
from Mrs. Duran's,

11:48.728 --> 11:52.095
and I was wondering
you go into that shit, baby?
Two on one action?

11:52.165 --> 11:53.962
All I'm saying,
if I was an ugly bitch

11:54.033 --> 11:57.560
and two hot studs like this
wanted to fuck me,
I'd be into it.

11:57.637 --> 12:00.401
I'm taking a shit
and I'm out.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.698
What are you thinking about?

12:28.768 --> 12:30.599
I don't know.

12:35.175 --> 12:37.006
You're really beautiful,
you know.

12:37.076 --> 12:39.067
Thank you.

12:46.319 --> 12:48.150
Are you pushing?

12:52.959 --> 12:54.358
Do you wanna kiss me?

12:56.696 --> 12:58.891
Do you wanna kiss me?

12:58.965 --> 13:01.695
For sure.
Kiss you.

13:03.102 --> 13:04.933
Fuck you.

13:05.004 --> 13:07.939
I'm sorry.
I just, just wanna fuck you,
you know.

13:08.007 --> 13:09.372
Alright.

13:11.678 --> 13:13.441
Alright?

13:13.513 --> 13:16.346
No.
You're bugging, man.

13:16.416 --> 13:20.682
I don't know
why I said that.
I wanna fuck you, you know.

13:20.753 --> 13:22.584
I wanna fuck you, too.

13:23.356 --> 13:25.847
I do.
I really do.

13:25.925 --> 13:26.949
For real?

13:27.026 --> 13:28.425
For real.

13:30.497 --> 13:33.295
<i>Class, this is Michael O'Shea.
He's a new student.</i>

13:33.366 --> 13:36.335
<i>He just moved here
this winter from Ireland.</i>

13:36.402 --> 13:40.304
And besides making music,
Michael wants to be a writer
just like his father.

13:40.373 --> 13:44.207
On his first day here,
he wants to read a poem
about America.

13:44.277 --> 13:46.507
<i>Here you go.</i>

13:47.947 --> 13:52.213
My name's Michael O'Shea,
and I'm from Scotland.

13:54.220 --> 13:58.554
Uh. My father says
poems don't always
have to rhyme.

13:58.625 --> 13:59.683
This one doesn't.

14:02.529 --> 14:07.967
<i>My New friend.
I know he likes me,
but I think he needs me.</i>

14:08.034 --> 14:13.097
<i>I definitely need him, too.
This is a scary place
sometimes.</i>

14:13.172 --> 14:14.696
But my new friend,
he needs me

14:14.774 --> 14:18.938
<i>because together
we're not like everybody else.</i>

14:19.012 --> 14:21.207
<i>That was very nice, Michael.
Thank you.</i>

14:21.281 --> 14:24.045
<i>Okay, class, let's turn
to page 64, please.
Thank you.</i>

14:27.120 --> 14:29.020
It's hot as shit out here.

14:30.189 --> 14:31.656
What the fuck
you looking at?

14:31.724 --> 14:34.659
Don't even fuckin' try
that shit.

14:34.727 --> 14:36.160
Want some gum?

14:38.631 --> 14:41.099
<i>Yo, did you really take
a shit in there?</i>

14:41.167 --> 14:42.600
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

14:42.669 --> 14:45.001
You smell
like open ass, man.

14:48.474 --> 14:50.999
<i>Hey!
Hey, old bitch.</i>

14:51.077 --> 14:53.841
Hey, hey.
Hey, put your ass here.

14:56.182 --> 14:57.410
Go ahead.

14:57.483 --> 15:01.283
Nice dress.
Fuckin' looking
like a cheetah.

15:01.354 --> 15:04.221
<i>Clean that shit up!</i>

15:04.290 --> 15:06.884
What?
Fucker!

15:06.960 --> 15:08.757
What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

15:08.828 --> 15:11.126
Clean your shit up
and tell him to fuck off!

15:11.197 --> 15:14.428
Police'll be here
in five minutes.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.900
Antonio, come on.

15:16.970 --> 15:18.301
No, no, no, no.

15:18.371 --> 15:19.269
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

15:19.339 --> 15:22.831
Open the door, man.
Hey, come on,
open the fuckin' door!

15:22.909 --> 15:25.469
Yo, meet me
at the park, alright?

15:25.545 --> 15:27.536
Meet me at the park.

15:27.614 --> 15:29.980
You fucker.
You better fuckin' flinch.

15:50.670 --> 15:53.400
<i>You're the new kid
from my class, right?
From Ireland.</i>

15:53.473 --> 15:55.236
<i>Scotland.</i>

15:55.308 --> 15:58.800
<i>We came and lived
in Manhattan for a bit
but now, yeah.</i>

16:01.848 --> 16:03.713
<i>Fucking crazy there, right?</i>

16:06.019 --> 16:07.077
<i>I'm Dito.</i>

16:07.153 --> 16:09.144
I'm, uh, I'm Dito.

16:09.222 --> 16:11.383
<i>Mick.
Uhm, Mike.</i>

16:11.457 --> 16:14.119
Mick.
Uhm, Mike.

16:15.962 --> 16:19.989
<i>And then Giuseppe was the kid
climbing on the window.
The church, the roof.</i>

16:20.800 --> 16:25.863
My friend, he was running naked
on the-- you remember that?
On the roof?

16:25.938 --> 16:26.996
<i>He was funny.</i>

16:28.675 --> 16:29.869
<i>Where you going?</i>

16:31.544 --> 16:33.444
<i>Just got bored,
you know?</i>

16:33.513 --> 16:35.447
<i>Kind of ride
the subway around.</i>

16:35.515 --> 16:37.676
<i>Back and forth,
and back and forth.</i>

16:37.750 --> 16:40.344
<i>And back and forth.
Back and forth.</i>

16:40.887 --> 16:41.945
<i>Stupid thing.</i>

16:42.021 --> 16:43.181
Just back and forth?

16:43.256 --> 16:44.621
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:46.059 --> 16:48.584
<i>I was gonna ride it
to Coney Island or something.</i>

16:48.661 --> 16:52.153
<i>Go there
and I don't know,
ride back.</i>

16:52.231 --> 16:55.689
I was thinking about going
to Coney Island, you know.

16:56.569 --> 16:58.764
<i>Yeah, 'cause I've never been.</i>

16:59.839 --> 17:01.238
<i>You've never been?</i>

17:02.075 --> 17:05.771
<i>No. I went to the zoo once
but that was like
in the Bronx or something.</i>

17:05.845 --> 17:06.834
It's not really--

17:06.913 --> 17:08.938
That's not traveling.

17:09.015 --> 17:11.313
<i>It sucks, too.
There's nothing really there.</i>

17:14.520 --> 17:15.748
What are you looking at?

17:15.821 --> 17:17.153
That dot.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.752
<i>Close one eye like this.</i>

17:22.762 --> 17:24.593
<i>Fly right over it.</i>

17:31.204 --> 17:32.694
<i>Oh, shit.
I got it.</i>

17:44.083 --> 17:45.277
<i>You want China?</i>

17:45.351 --> 17:47.148
<i>That's what they got
Chinatown for.</i>

17:47.220 --> 17:51.657
You want Italy?
You go to Georgie.
Where's the Italians they go?

17:51.724 --> 17:53.089
Mulberry Street.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.183
<i>Little Italy.</i>

17:54.260 --> 17:58.196
Wanna go to Puerto Rico?
Go uptown. There's
Puerto Ricans everywhere.

17:58.264 --> 18:00.391
You know what Antonio
just told me?

18:00.466 --> 18:03.230
<i>That there's wild dogs
in Italy, right?
Who needs that?</i>

18:03.302 --> 18:04.360
Not me.

18:04.437 --> 18:06.234
I don't wanna be there.

18:08.274 --> 18:09.741
How are you?
Nice seeing you.

18:09.809 --> 18:11.538
Uncle George,
how you doing?

18:11.611 --> 18:12.873
I'm just boiling.

18:12.945 --> 18:16.005
<i>It's summertime.
That's why you're boiling.</i>

18:16.082 --> 18:18.016
You want some juice?

18:18.084 --> 18:19.449
Where you been?

18:19.519 --> 18:21.419
<i>I was in Coney Island.</i>

18:21.487 --> 18:23.250
<i>What were you doing there?</i>

18:23.322 --> 18:26.018
I was on the train.
I meet up with this guy
from school.

18:26.092 --> 18:29.619
<i>This Mike kid.
He's from Ireland.
Like from the country Ireland.</i>

18:29.695 --> 18:33.563
He was telling me about
how he wants to do some music,
like a band or something.

18:33.633 --> 18:35.533
You just went
to Coney Island.

18:35.601 --> 18:38.069
Is it just me
or it's 100 degrees
in this house?

18:38.137 --> 18:41.903
<i>It's summer.
That's why it's hot.
Right, Antonio?</i>

18:41.974 --> 18:43.703
Yeah.
It's summer.

18:43.776 --> 18:45.334
It's, summer, baby.
It's hot.

18:45.411 --> 18:46.708
<i>What can I tell you?</i>

18:46.779 --> 18:52.445
Will you just stop teasing?
The heat's unbearable.
We gotta get a fan, Monty.

18:52.518 --> 18:53.883
We gotta get a fan.

18:53.953 --> 18:56.183
<i>Maria, you still there?</i>

18:56.255 --> 18:58.120
<i>I have to attach
this machine.</i>

18:58.191 --> 19:01.456
<i>She's gonna set
this place on fire!</i>

19:01.527 --> 19:03.119
<i>Can I see
what's going on?</i>

19:03.196 --> 19:06.324
<i>I brought the tape.
I brought the machine
to show you, Monty.</i>

19:06.399 --> 19:08.026
<i>I don't care
about that machine.</i>

19:08.100 --> 19:10.227
<i>You can play things
from the television.</i>

19:10.303 --> 19:11.531
So it's that machine.

19:11.604 --> 19:14.004
<i>Rewind that.
Let's see that again.</i>

19:14.073 --> 19:17.668
<i>Dito, where you going?
It's show time over here.</i>

19:17.743 --> 19:21.975
Are you expecting a date
with that girl?
That swimmer?

19:22.048 --> 19:26.314
We heard from your friend
you have a girlfriend now, huh?
She's a swimmer?

19:26.385 --> 19:29.513
A Swimmer?
Who, Laurie?
She sells food at the pool.

19:29.589 --> 19:31.648
Yeah, she sells food
at the pool.

19:31.724 --> 19:34.158
<i>That swimmer girl?
right, Antonio?</i>

19:34.227 --> 19:35.888
<i>The swimmer girl.</i>

19:35.962 --> 19:39.159
Uncle George,
she's not a swimmer.
She sells food at the pool.

19:39.232 --> 19:40.324
That's what she does.

19:40.399 --> 19:43.425
What does she do?
Like races or marathons?

19:43.502 --> 19:46.232
Maybe it was the guy
from Coney Island.
The Irish guy.

19:46.305 --> 19:48.933
The guy who wants the band.
Right, Monty?

19:49.008 --> 19:50.339
<i>She's a swimmer.</i>

19:50.409 --> 19:52.843
<i>What's she doing at the pool
if she don't swim?</i>

19:56.883 --> 19:59.818
<i>You have seven
new messages.</i>

20:00.386 --> 20:02.650
<i>Uh, Dito,
this is Nerf.</i>

20:03.322 --> 20:05.313
<i>Your old friend Nerf.</i>

20:06.125 --> 20:09.390
<i>Monty's not,
not doing too good, man.</i>

20:09.462 --> 20:12.795
<i>I know Antonio called you
and, uh,</i>

20:14.033 --> 20:16.831
<i>you-- you're father's
real sick, man.</i>

20:18.137 --> 20:19.832
<i>Your mom called me</i>

20:19.906 --> 20:25.003
<i>and... she really wants you
to come home, you know.</i>

20:25.077 --> 20:26.374
<i>So you should.</i>

20:26.445 --> 20:28.310
Hey, come back.

20:28.381 --> 20:30.440
Fuck you!

20:30.516 --> 20:32.040
I hate those fucks!

20:32.118 --> 20:33.107
<i>What are you doing?</i>

20:33.185 --> 20:35.278
Pay, thank.

20:35.354 --> 20:36.412
Oh, my God.

20:36.489 --> 20:39.788
Chinese motherfucker
always staring me down!

20:39.859 --> 20:42.327
<i>You pay.</i>

20:42.395 --> 20:44.386
Why does your dad
calls us swimmers?

20:44.463 --> 20:45.953
'Cause you work
at a pool.

20:46.032 --> 20:47.624
But I'm not a swimmer.

20:48.401 --> 20:53.600
<i>You better tell Antonio
and his fucking brother
not to come around my house.</i>

20:53.673 --> 20:55.334
I don't like that asshole.

20:55.408 --> 20:56.898
Diane, don't worry
about it.

20:56.976 --> 21:00.537
He's a controlling little fuck!
I could tell
just by looking at him.

21:00.613 --> 21:02.205
<i>You're making it bigger.</i>

21:02.281 --> 21:04.977
Stop being crazy, alright?

21:05.051 --> 21:07.849
Is it just me
or does that nigger
seem retarded?

21:07.920 --> 21:11.412
What the fuck are you doing?
That's my friend's
mother's store.

21:11.490 --> 21:13.583
<i>That's the shit they wrote
on your housel</i>

21:13.659 --> 21:15.251
What the fuck
are you doing?

21:15.328 --> 21:16.317
You got a problem?

21:16.395 --> 21:18.295
<i>Get off him right now.
I'm not playing.</i>

21:19.465 --> 21:21.865
<i>What the fuck?
Are you crazy?
Fucking bitch!</i>

21:21.934 --> 21:23.925
That's right, asshole.

21:24.003 --> 21:26.267
I don't have a problem.
Laurie, go get Antonio.

21:26.339 --> 21:28.773
You need a bitch
to go get your man?

21:28.841 --> 21:31.708
I should fuckin' kill you!
I should fuckin' kill you.

21:31.777 --> 21:35.838
I'm gonna get you.
I got you, baby.
You stupid fuckin' bitch!

21:35.915 --> 21:37.712
You nappy motherfucker.

21:37.783 --> 21:39.114
I got you!

21:41.220 --> 21:43.211
<i>Explain this to me.</i>

21:43.289 --> 21:45.450
<i>You and this swimmer
got into some trouble?</i>

21:45.524 --> 21:47.856
Mr. Montiel,
I don't even swim.

21:47.927 --> 21:50.020
You don't swim.
Look at that eye.

21:50.096 --> 21:53.327
We collect tickets
where the food is
at the swimming pool.

21:53.399 --> 21:56.596
I'm thinking of quitting.
Maybe working
at the supermarket.

21:56.669 --> 21:59.103
It's just like
too many kids.

21:59.171 --> 22:00.468
Yeah, we care.

22:00.539 --> 22:02.302
<i>Fuck you, okay?</i>

22:02.375 --> 22:05.708
Put this on your eye, alright?

22:05.778 --> 22:07.939
<i>I'm not putting meat
on my eye.</i>

22:08.014 --> 22:11.074
Get out of here.
I'm not putting that
on my face.

22:11.150 --> 22:13.141
People used to do that
100 years ago.

22:13.219 --> 22:16.882
I just want to know
what's going on.
Tell me what happened.

22:16.956 --> 22:19.254
<i>Nothing's going on.
It's very simple.</i>

22:19.325 --> 22:21.725
What happened to your eye?

22:21.794 --> 22:23.887
I'm telling you,
nothing happened, okay?

22:23.963 --> 22:26.625
Some jerk was acting
like a wise guy.

22:26.699 --> 22:30.362
Daddy, some jerk was acting
like a wise guy.
That's it.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.767
That's it, okay?

22:31.837 --> 22:33.668
<i>You got cut a little bit.</i>

22:33.739 --> 22:35.604
He grabbed him
by the face
and cut him.

22:35.674 --> 22:39.303
Who grabbed him
by the face?
A Puerto Rican?

22:39.378 --> 22:42.176
The one that spray painted
all the graffiti outside.

22:42.248 --> 22:44.842
A Puerto Rican did this?
Was it the Reaper guy?

22:44.917 --> 22:45.941
Please, stop it.

22:46.018 --> 22:49.749
Don't ask me to stop it.
This guy better worry now.
And I know where he is.

22:49.822 --> 22:52.347
<i>Nerf told me where they stay
down by Queensbridge.</i>

22:52.425 --> 22:56.953
Remember what I said.
Two shots.
Six inches, they go right down.

22:57.029 --> 22:58.826
Two shots?
Shit.

22:58.898 --> 23:01.958
<i>Shut the fuck up.
I'm sorry, Monty.
I don't mean to be cursing.</i>

23:02.034 --> 23:04.832
That's enough, okay?
Hey!

23:07.873 --> 23:10.933
God gave me this mouth
so I can use it
and that's what I'm doing.

23:11.010 --> 23:12.705
<i>Am I gonna have
to smack this girl?</i>

23:12.778 --> 23:14.473
She's just talking.

23:15.881 --> 23:17.473
Get the fuck
out of my way!

23:22.621 --> 23:25.055
<i>Yo, Yo,
get the fuck out!</i>

23:25.124 --> 23:28.491
<i>Hey, fuckin',
Nerf, where the fuck
did you get a car?</i>

23:28.561 --> 23:31.428
My mother let me
take it out to practice
for my license.

23:31.497 --> 23:32.964
How'd your mother
get a car?

23:33.032 --> 23:35.159
I gotta practice
for my license.

23:35.234 --> 23:38.226
Hey, get off the car!
Get the fuck off my car!

23:38.304 --> 23:39.328
What the fuck?

23:39.405 --> 23:41.202
<i>Get in, get in.
Let's go.</i>

23:41.273 --> 23:43.332
<i>No, don't get in.</i>

23:43.409 --> 23:45.172
I'm coming back.
I'm coming back.

23:45.244 --> 23:46.711
<i>You're gonna leave me, then?</i>

23:46.779 --> 23:48.178
This thing is huge!

23:48.247 --> 23:49.373
I'm coming back.

23:49.448 --> 23:51.712
<i>We're gonna go
around the block.</i>

23:51.784 --> 23:53.479
What happened
to your face?

23:53.552 --> 23:55.679
They hit him in the face
with a bottle.

23:55.754 --> 24:00.123
Your graffiti friends
hit him with a bottle.
They fucked up your mom's store.

24:00.192 --> 24:02.057
Dito.

24:02.128 --> 24:04.619
<i>I don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

24:04.697 --> 24:06.187
Take us down
to Queensbridge.

24:06.265 --> 24:07.892
I gotta take
the car back.

24:07.967 --> 24:10.060
Take me down
to Queensbridge right now.

24:10.136 --> 24:11.330
No, I can't.

24:11.403 --> 24:13.428
Fuck it.
I'll drive.

24:13.506 --> 24:15.303
Alright.

24:15.374 --> 24:17.672
Shut up!

24:17.743 --> 24:21.304
<i>Are you gonna call me?
I'm gonna be on this corner.
You better call me, Dito.</i>

24:23.282 --> 24:26.046
<i>Your graffiti friends
hit him in the face
with a bottle.</i>

24:41.901 --> 24:43.596
What, are you fuckin' stupid?

24:51.577 --> 24:52.908
What did you say?

24:52.978 --> 24:54.309
He's my brother.

24:59.652 --> 25:02.018
You know the guy
that writes graffiti around here?

25:02.087 --> 25:04.055
<i>No hablo inglés.</i>

25:04.123 --> 25:07.024
<i>No habla fuckin' Inglés.</i>

25:09.128 --> 25:11.995
What the fuck
you doing out
so late, man?

25:14.333 --> 25:17.234
<i>So you know the kids
that write graffiti
and shit, right?</i>

25:17.303 --> 25:18.600
How you know them?

25:19.738 --> 25:24.732
Because one of,
one of the members
are my brother.

25:24.810 --> 25:26.141
Is your brother?

25:26.212 --> 25:28.578
Your bro-- brother?

25:30.816 --> 25:31.840
Reaper.

25:31.917 --> 25:33.111
Reaper?

25:34.186 --> 25:36.381
You see my friend
right there?

25:37.189 --> 25:38.850
<i>He's cut, right?</i>

25:38.924 --> 25:41.017
<i>Your brother did that.</i>

25:41.093 --> 25:45.530
<i>Yeah, he cut Dito.
Can you say that?
Can you say his name?</i>

25:45.598 --> 25:47.395
He cut Dito.

25:47.466 --> 25:49.991
You can tell him
Antonio came by?
Yeah?

25:50.069 --> 25:51.559
<i>He's a little kid, man.</i>

25:51.637 --> 25:54.231
You can remember
to tell him that for me?
He cut Dito.

25:54.306 --> 25:57.605
I like this kid.
I like this kid.
I like him.

25:58.744 --> 26:02.510
<i>This kid's good.
Alright, I like this kid.</i>

26:02.581 --> 26:06.915
Are you fuckin' stupid?
What's wrong with you?
Let's get out of here!

26:06.986 --> 26:08.419
<i>Let's go.
Come on, let's go.</i>

26:08.487 --> 26:10.352
<i>I sent a little
fuckin' message.</i>

26:31.176 --> 26:32.939
Your father's not stupid.

26:35.781 --> 26:38.181
<i>I swear your father's
a good guy, man.</i>

26:38.250 --> 26:40.775
<i>If anybody ever
fucked with him,
forget it.</i>

26:41.687 --> 26:43.552
<i>Antonio's not a well kid.</i>

26:43.622 --> 26:45.351
He shouldn't be
hanging out with him.

26:45.424 --> 26:46.789
He's a good kid.

26:46.859 --> 26:47.883
No!

26:47.960 --> 26:50.428
I was any different?
Come on, stop it.

26:50.496 --> 26:53.795
You were so much different.
You are a great father.

26:53.866 --> 26:57.358
Not this guy's dad.
He beats him to a pulp.

27:06.445 --> 27:09.312
<i>He's a good guy, you know?
He's a good guy.</i>

27:51.123 --> 27:55.890
<i>That's right, motherfucker!
That's the song?</i>

27:55.961 --> 27:59.863
<i>That's right, motherfucker!</i>

27:59.932 --> 28:03.265
Man, I'm telling you,
your band's gonna be
fuckin' hardcore, man.

28:03.335 --> 28:05.599
Yo, Radioman,
what's up, my man?

28:05.671 --> 28:06.899
Who the fuck
is that guy?

28:06.972 --> 28:08.963
He's cool.
Your band has to be cool.

28:09.041 --> 28:14.570
We need to be like Black Flag,
Bad Brains, Urban Waste,
Major Conflict, all of them.

28:14.646 --> 28:16.705
Those bands rule.
That's fuckin' music.

28:16.782 --> 28:20.183
Our band needs to be cool.
We need a good name.

28:20.252 --> 28:21.276
For what?

28:21.353 --> 28:23.583
The band.
This is it.

28:23.655 --> 28:25.350
Right here?

28:25.424 --> 28:26.721
This is Frank?

28:26.792 --> 28:29.761
What's the deal with this Frank?
We can do the job together.

28:29.828 --> 28:33.025
Definitely.
He's going to go
on about Job.

28:33.098 --> 28:35.794
You know,
the guy from the Bible.
Just say you know.

28:36.602 --> 28:38.092
Which one's the job?

28:38.170 --> 28:40.730
He's got like
everything going on, man.
He's cool.

28:40.806 --> 28:44.970
<i>I told him
you don't have to be a fag
to talk like a fag.</i>

28:45.043 --> 28:48.672
Therefore you don't
have to be a fag to have
your dogs walked by a fag.

28:48.747 --> 28:51.272
Watch the little one.
I gotta go, Raul.

28:51.350 --> 28:55.810
I gotta call this pain in the ass
before it gets too late.

28:55.888 --> 28:57.378
Yeah.

28:58.490 --> 29:01.391
Oh, unbelievable.

29:01.460 --> 29:03.155
Frank, this is Dito.

29:03.228 --> 29:05.253
Hi.

29:05.330 --> 29:06.558
Okay.

29:06.632 --> 29:09.692
Mikey, there's $10
I owe you in dimes.
It's on the floor.

29:09.768 --> 29:12.828
Take it for train fares, okay?

29:12.905 --> 29:14.338
<i>Yes?</i>

29:15.441 --> 29:18.137
Miss Levitt,
I was just gonna call you.

29:18.210 --> 29:22.010
I would never take little Bobo
onto the subway.
Please!

29:22.848 --> 29:24.406
George, come here.
Come here!

29:26.318 --> 29:27.512
No, I'm serious.

29:27.586 --> 29:30.885
You gotta tell me
who would say things
like that about me.

29:33.258 --> 29:35.249
No.
Wha--

29:36.462 --> 29:39.522
I got somebody here.
Let me ask.
Listen, Hey!

29:39.598 --> 29:44.058
You know the video
of, uh, Lionel Richie
with the blind lady?

29:44.136 --> 29:45.296
<i>Hello.</i>

29:45.370 --> 29:47.531
<i>Hello.
Yes.</i>

29:47.606 --> 29:50.268
She heard you.
I love that song, too.

29:52.244 --> 29:53.768
Yes.

29:53.846 --> 29:55.746
Yes, 9:00

29:55.814 --> 29:57.406
Thank you!

29:58.116 --> 30:00.346
Oh!
Nightmare!

30:00.419 --> 30:03.388
Okay.
Let's go.
Come on.

30:04.156 --> 30:06.590
<i>I got Shakespeare.
Let's go, guys.
Come one.</i>

30:07.493 --> 30:09.188
Let's go.
Come on, come on!

30:09.895 --> 30:12.728
Come on.
Did you take the dimes
for the train fare?

30:12.798 --> 30:15.392
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
And close the door.

30:15.467 --> 30:19.198
You see, they're insects.
Fuckin' horseflies
like animals in this place.

30:19.271 --> 30:22.172
<i>I don't want them
getting out.
Get George.</i>

30:22.708 --> 30:25.802
Let's go.
That's it, come on.
Let's go, come on.

30:28.580 --> 30:32.311
My good friend here says
your name is Titi
or Chiti or Rodito.

30:32.384 --> 30:33.783
Dito.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.181
And you guys
are gonna do a band?

30:36.255 --> 30:37.449
Dito's gonna sing.

30:37.523 --> 30:40.151
Oh, how gay.
I mean, great.

30:40.225 --> 30:42.989
Is this gonna be
like Lionel Richie
or you guys rock out?

30:43.061 --> 30:46.827
No, Frank.
We're gonna be hardcore
like Black Flag.

30:46.899 --> 30:49.800
One of my clients, Bobby,
he has the Pomeranian.

30:49.868 --> 30:53.599
He's an entertainment manager,
like music or something.

30:53.672 --> 30:56.664
I'll have you guys
walk his dog.
You never know, right?

30:56.742 --> 30:58.334
Hello there, Abigail.

30:58.410 --> 31:01.243
Taking the dog out
for a drag again,
I see.

31:02.648 --> 31:06.175
She's too cheap
to pay the six bucks
for me to walk that thing.

31:06.251 --> 31:08.344
I mean, come on,
they're older than dirt.

31:08.987 --> 31:10.511
Frank, what's the job about?

31:10.589 --> 31:13.615
Miss Abigail needs
some hot young action,
right lovely?

31:13.692 --> 31:14.818
Come here.
George.

31:14.893 --> 31:17.157
She can't hear worth shit.

31:17.229 --> 31:20.289
You walk dogs
for half an hour
or until they crap.

31:20.365 --> 31:22.333
I charge them $6.
I give you $4.

31:22.401 --> 31:23.993
I thought we get $3.

31:24.703 --> 31:28.537
This is one honest
young man, this boy.
Like Job from the Bible.

31:28.607 --> 31:30.370
You know
who Job is, Condito?

31:30.442 --> 31:32.307
Yeah.
I already told him, Frank.

31:32.377 --> 31:35.346
You just got a raise then,
for the band.

31:35.414 --> 31:38.315
'Cause we walk dogs, you know?
You walk dogs.

31:38.383 --> 31:40.715
Whole wide world
walks fuckin' dogs.

31:41.820 --> 31:44.311
Always carry paper.
Pretend you pick up the crap.

31:46.024 --> 31:47.355
<i>Ay!</i>

31:47.426 --> 31:49.951
How loud
is this freaking city.

32:20.993 --> 32:22.756
<i>Nerf.</i>

32:25.163 --> 32:26.152
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

32:26.231 --> 32:28.199
It's good to see you, man.
Really.

32:28.266 --> 32:29.858
<i>Thanks for picking me up.</i>

32:29.935 --> 32:33.268
Hey, no problem, man.
I couldn't believe it
when you called, dude.

32:34.006 --> 32:37.965
I still can't fucking' believe it,
but you're here, man.
It's fucked up, right?

32:38.043 --> 32:40.443
<i>It's been a long time,
and it's great to see you.</i>

32:40.512 --> 32:43.276
You bugged out
when Antonio called, huh?

32:43.348 --> 32:46.317
I still can't believe it, you know.
That's all.

32:46.385 --> 32:48.285
Guess who I saw
the other day?

32:48.353 --> 32:51.288
Fuckin' Laurie.
Your old fuckin' girl, right?

32:51.356 --> 32:54.484
Still up on Ditmars.
She's got a kid now.
Kid's a fuckin' rat.

32:54.559 --> 32:57.426
<i>She's got a kid?
Who with?</i>

32:57.496 --> 32:58.622
I don't fuckin' know.

32:58.697 --> 33:00.631
<i>Not that Guido
who used to hit on her?</i>

33:00.699 --> 33:03.668
<i>Guido Tony!
No, no.
Fuckin' no.</i>

33:03.735 --> 33:06.898
That motherfucker
went to the army
or some shit.

33:06.972 --> 33:09.600
Maybe he invented something.
I don't really know.

33:13.145 --> 33:16.308
<i>Hey, remember this place?
Greek Pancyprian Club.</i>

33:16.381 --> 33:17.871
Yo!

33:17.949 --> 33:21.976
<i>Uh, this place rock or disco?</i>

33:22.054 --> 33:23.783
<i>I hate that shit.</i>

33:25.157 --> 33:26.522
<i>Fuckers.</i>

33:28.660 --> 33:33.097
Uh, it's a full-on
Yuppie club now, man.
Unbelievable.

33:33.165 --> 33:36.430
Better that way, though.
People always dress up
and shit.

33:37.536 --> 33:40.130
It looks a little bit better
around here, you know.

33:41.006 --> 33:42.405
<i>Your mom's still here, huh?</i>

33:42.474 --> 33:43.668
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:45.343 --> 33:47.538
<i>But she's sleeping.</i>

33:47.612 --> 33:51.514
I mean, everybody says
I should get
my own place, but--

33:51.583 --> 33:56.020
I ain't got to pay rent.
You get free food.
For now, you know.

33:56.088 --> 33:59.023
<i>Thanks for letting me stay.
I can get a hotel
if you want.</i>

33:59.091 --> 34:00.353
Hotel?

34:01.359 --> 34:03.759
Hell, man.
My mom's got the room
all cleaned out.

34:03.829 --> 34:08.493
She's all excited.
She thinks you know all
the movie stars in California.

34:10.001 --> 34:12.161
Wait a minute.
Let's just, uh--

34:12.237 --> 34:14.431
Let's just hang here
a minute, okay?

34:15.407 --> 34:16.965
I mean, damn.

34:17.042 --> 34:19.840
I didn't think I was ever
gonna see you again,
you know.

34:19.911 --> 34:22.436
Upstairs we can't really talk.

34:24.248 --> 34:26.183
You want some?

34:26.251 --> 34:28.150
<i>Uh, no, no.
That's cool.</i>

34:28.687 --> 34:29.949
I just take a little.

34:30.021 --> 34:31.248
Yeah, sure.

34:32.357 --> 34:34.791
We just--
We should go to Monty's
right now.

34:34.860 --> 34:36.554
<i>Nah, it's late.
It's late.</i>

34:37.562 --> 34:39.530
What time is it?

34:40.465 --> 34:42.489
We'll go in the morning, then.

34:45.504 --> 34:48.199
I hate to--
I hate seeing him
like he is, man.

34:48.273 --> 34:49.706
He's fucked up.

34:52.143 --> 34:53.804
And your mom,
she--

34:54.679 --> 34:56.579
She didn't think
you'd come back.

34:57.682 --> 34:59.377
She told me that, uh--

35:01.153 --> 35:03.348
She tells everybody
about your book.

35:04.723 --> 35:08.659
It's like your friend, remember?
That, that kid, fuckin' Irish.

35:15.133 --> 35:17.033
How are you?

35:17.102 --> 35:18.228
How am I?

35:18.303 --> 35:19.895
Are you alright?

35:19.971 --> 35:22.439
I'm alright.
Ah!

35:22.507 --> 35:25.476
I don't know
how to answer that, man.

35:25.544 --> 35:28.411
Just like my fuckin' mom.
Like I told you.

35:28.480 --> 35:32.917
I told you how she's so excited
to see you, and then with me,
you know, it's like--

35:34.886 --> 35:35.944
When I--

35:37.289 --> 35:40.087
She sees me
on the street,
she hides.

35:41.193 --> 35:47.291
And she's so fat, you know.
And she tries to hide behind
these skinny little poles.

35:47.365 --> 35:49.993
Poles like that
right there.

35:52.671 --> 35:55.902
Even she hides from me
and she's my fuckin' mom.

35:56.975 --> 35:58.602
They're not supposed
to do that.

35:58.677 --> 36:01.703
I know.
Things will--

36:01.780 --> 36:04.078
Things will pick up
and get better.

36:05.016 --> 36:06.608
No, man.

36:07.752 --> 36:11.279
Things don't get better here.
You tell me
that they fuckin' do, but--

36:19.798 --> 36:22.858
It's really,
it's fuckin' good
to see you, man.

36:22.934 --> 36:24.458
That's the truth.

36:26.438 --> 36:28.838
Is that true?

36:34.045 --> 36:35.706
<i>Shit!</i>

36:41.553 --> 36:43.418
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

36:48.026 --> 36:51.689
<i>They got this thing
over the Empire State Building</i>

36:51.763 --> 36:53.822
<i>which is like Ripley's
Believe it or Not.</i>

36:53.899 --> 36:56.834
Mike was telling me
about this guy he saw.
He's humongous.

36:56.902 --> 37:01.305
<i>It's a 10-foot tall statue
of this real guy
and a bunch of other shit.</i>

37:01.373 --> 37:03.568
That's where the niggers
stay at, right?

37:03.642 --> 37:05.872
<i>No.
That's 42nd Street.</i>

37:05.944 --> 37:09.675
<i>Oh, Yeah.
Needledick was saying they got
triple X movie over there.</i>

37:09.748 --> 37:12.273
<i>Like fuckin' people
fuckin' pigs and shit.</i>

37:12.350 --> 37:15.342
<i>People fuckin' pigs?
Get the fuck out of here!</i>

37:15.420 --> 37:18.218
<i>This guy is like 10 feet tall.
He's fuckin' huge, man.</i>

37:18.290 --> 37:20.121
There's loads
of cool shit there.

37:20.191 --> 37:21.988
<i>Check this guy out.</i>

37:22.060 --> 37:24.790
What do you wanna see,
some fuckin' titties
or a giant?

37:24.863 --> 37:26.831
Yeah, I wanna see a pig
get fucked.

37:26.898 --> 37:28.297
<i>Exactly.</i>

37:30.368 --> 37:35.635
<i>Mike, huh?
Dito says that you guys work
for some faggot, right?</i>

37:35.707 --> 37:37.572
<i>Think he can give me
a job?</i>

37:38.443 --> 37:40.138
I'll see.

37:40.211 --> 37:41.200
<i>Yeah?</i>

37:41.279 --> 37:42.644
<i>Yeah, man.
I'll check out.</i>

37:42.714 --> 37:44.807
<i>Yo, this weed is bogus.</i>

37:44.883 --> 37:49.479
<i>I know a guy from school.
He's got great weed.
That shit will fuck you up.</i>

37:49.554 --> 37:52.022
He's cool as well.
Guy is cool.

37:52.090 --> 37:53.421
<i>Wow!</i>

37:54.159 --> 37:57.890
You can get weed, huh?
This guy's pretty fuckin' cool.

37:58.496 --> 38:01.488
<i>He can get fuckin' pot.</i>

38:01.566 --> 38:04.364
<i>That's pretty fuckin'--yeah.
This guy's pretty cool.</i>

38:04.436 --> 38:06.063
<i>You can understand
what he says?</i>

38:06.137 --> 38:08.867
<i>'Cause I can't fuckin'
understand him.</i>

38:08.940 --> 38:11.272
Yo, Dito,
I'm going to take off, man.

38:12.010 --> 38:15.241
Where you going?
Where you going?

38:15.981 --> 38:18.108
What's your problem, man?

38:18.917 --> 38:20.714
<i>Antonio, I don't want
any trouble.</i>

38:20.785 --> 38:24.084
I just wanna hang out.
If you got a problem
with me, I'll go.

38:24.155 --> 38:25.986
<i>No, man.
I ain't got no problem.</i>

38:26.057 --> 38:27.854
You can hang out
as much as you want.

38:27.926 --> 38:30.451
You can show us
where the giants are
and all that.

38:30.528 --> 38:33.793
I like this guy.
He's, he's fun.
He's a good guy.

38:33.865 --> 38:36.265
<i>We're getting something
to eat,</i>

38:36.334 --> 38:39.235
<i>and she wants to go
go White Castle.</i>

38:39.304 --> 38:40.828
<i>Why don't you shut up?</i>

38:40.905 --> 38:42.395
<i>Why you got to do this?</i>

38:43.675 --> 38:44.505
What'd you say?

38:44.576 --> 38:46.043
<i>Why you got to do
that shit?</i>

38:46.111 --> 38:48.011
Don't you fuckin' move, Diane.

38:49.481 --> 38:51.039
Cut the fuckin' shit, alright?

38:51.116 --> 38:52.413
Do what?

38:52.484 --> 38:56.011
<i>You know what.
It's just played out.</i>

38:56.087 --> 38:58.282
<i>What's played out?</i>

39:02.694 --> 39:03.820
She moved.

39:03.895 --> 39:07.592
What the fuck.
I'm fucking serious.
That shit is not funny!

39:07.665 --> 39:09.394
<i>Giuseppe, that's enough.</i>

39:09.467 --> 39:11.264
I'm getting the fuck
out of here.

39:11.336 --> 39:13.600
<i>Yeah?
Go ahead.
Bye.</i>

39:13.671 --> 39:16.640
<i>Could you do something
about your fucking
crazy brother?</i>

39:16.708 --> 39:18.300
Fuck you, Giuseppe, alright?

39:18.977 --> 39:22.208
<i>You fuckin' piece of shit!
Fuck you.</i>

39:23.915 --> 39:26.110
<i>Laurie!</i>

39:26.184 --> 39:28.448
She wants to go
to White Castle, alright?

39:28.520 --> 39:33.389
This bitch loves going
to White Castle.
To White Castle.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.323
<i>Laurie?
Come on.</i>

39:35.393 --> 39:37.861
<i>Where you going?</i>

39:37.929 --> 39:40.363
Fuck them.
It's played out here.

39:41.633 --> 39:45.933
<i>Laurie.
Laurie, can you stop for a sec?
Laurie, come on!</i>

39:46.004 --> 39:48.632
Did you really see
what that fucker did?

39:48.706 --> 39:49.798
<i>I know.</i>

39:49.874 --> 39:51.842
You think that's funny?

39:51.910 --> 39:54.845
I know it's not funny.
I don't think it's funny.

39:54.913 --> 39:56.175
Hold on a second!

39:56.247 --> 39:58.613
<i>I'm sorry.
I don't fuckin'
like that, either.</i>

39:58.683 --> 40:01.311
Yeah, right.
You do.

40:01.386 --> 40:03.877
I'm coming.
I'll be right there, alright?

40:04.956 --> 40:07.151
<i>I am sorry.</i>

40:08.093 --> 40:09.287
<i>Whatever.</i>

41:02.680 --> 41:05.615
Hey, my name is Diane.
I like to fuck.

41:08.019 --> 41:09.611
My name is Jenny.

41:09.687 --> 41:12.588
And everybody in this place
is a fuckin' joke.

41:13.291 --> 41:15.418
My name is Nerf.

41:15.493 --> 41:16.926
And this shit sucks.

41:18.630 --> 41:21.155
I'm Giuseppe,
Antonio's brother.

41:22.567 --> 41:24.728
I'm Laurie.

41:24.802 --> 41:26.531
And everybody's
gonna leave me.

41:28.106 --> 41:29.539
I know they are.

41:33.912 --> 41:36.039
I'm a fuckin' piece of shit.

41:37.282 --> 41:39.079
And that's who I am.

42:24.963 --> 42:28.126
<i>Hey, listen, Antonio.
I'm sorry about this
played out shit.</i>

42:28.199 --> 42:29.325
Don't worry about it.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.561
No, that's fucked up!

42:37.508 --> 42:39.100
Now, that's fucked up.

42:43.281 --> 42:44.976
I'm going to go in.

42:46.517 --> 42:47.711
Do you want me to come?

42:47.785 --> 42:48.683
No.

42:49.988 --> 42:51.046
Don't worry.

42:51.122 --> 42:53.113
I'm good.
I'll call you tomorrow.

42:54.325 --> 43:00.025
<i>Monty said he wanted to play
some handball tomorrow.
So I'm gonna come by.</i>

43:00.098 --> 43:01.565
That's fucked up.

43:06.771 --> 43:09.740
<i>He's my Goddamned son, too.</i>

43:09.807 --> 43:12.503
<i>They run around
like a pack of wolves!</i>

43:12.577 --> 43:16.138
<i>Do you even have
any concern?
Do you?</i>

43:16.214 --> 43:18.307
<i>No!</i>

43:21.886 --> 43:24.650
What's wrong?
You okay, mom?

43:24.722 --> 43:26.314
I'm okay.

43:26.391 --> 43:28.552
It's okay.
It's nothing.

43:49.380 --> 43:50.813
Dito.

43:53.451 --> 43:56.818
She, you know,
she got excited, you know.

43:59.057 --> 44:02.823
I was just, uh--
Your mother, she-- you know,
went for a walk.

44:02.894 --> 44:04.691
She gets excited.

44:05.797 --> 44:06.889
You okay?

44:06.964 --> 44:09.194
Fine.

44:10.034 --> 44:11.194
<i>I'm good.</i>

44:12.737 --> 44:15.171
What happened with you
and Antonio?
He was here.

44:15.239 --> 44:18.606
He said you were mad at him.
You had a fight or something?

44:21.479 --> 44:22.946
It's alright.

44:26.284 --> 44:28.479
<i>How'd get that?
What's this on your face?</i>

44:30.188 --> 44:31.416
You okay?

44:31.489 --> 44:32.854
<i>Yeah.</i>

44:43.401 --> 44:45.528
<i>What happened to you?
What is this?</i>

44:45.603 --> 44:47.070
It's nothing.

44:48.306 --> 44:50.399
Hey, come on.
You know me.

44:51.242 --> 44:53.142
Rock of Gibraltar, right?

44:53.211 --> 44:54.371
Yeah.

44:55.813 --> 44:57.075
Yeah.

44:58.950 --> 45:00.508
<i>You been taking
your Dilantin?</i>

45:00.585 --> 45:02.348
<i>What, are you writing
a book, huh?</i>

45:02.420 --> 45:03.717
No, it's just--

45:04.622 --> 45:06.146
<i>I'm fine, okay?</i>

45:06.224 --> 45:07.782
You were on one
of your journeys

45:07.859 --> 45:12.091
with that kid Mike
in Manhattan.
Antonio was telling me.

45:12.163 --> 45:13.960
<i>I wasn't with Mike.</i>

45:16.768 --> 45:20.101
What if I did go?
What if I went to Manhattan
or I went somewhere else

45:20.171 --> 45:22.332
like, uh, I don't know?

45:27.311 --> 45:30.075
Come on.
You're not
going anywhere, Dito.

45:32.850 --> 45:33.942
Come here.

45:35.787 --> 45:37.584
<i>How are you, Dito, huh?</i>

45:38.589 --> 45:40.682
<i>Since when are you here
at this time?</i>

45:41.959 --> 45:44.450
Put on the TV.
Give your old man
a break, huh?

46:14.525 --> 46:15.924
Forget it.

46:17.328 --> 46:18.989
Are you scared?

46:20.465 --> 46:22.126
<i>I would be.</i>

46:22.767 --> 46:26.863
If a guy wrote on my house
"I was dead",
he's already fucked you up.

46:26.938 --> 46:29.236
I'd be having
a fuckin' heart attack.

46:32.877 --> 46:34.344
They just write shit.

46:35.580 --> 46:38.242
Locker room
disinfectant stuff, right?

46:38.316 --> 46:40.477
<i>Check this shit out.</i>

46:40.551 --> 46:44.317
"Do not inhale, breathe.
Avoid skin-eye contact.

46:44.388 --> 46:47.084
Irritant.
Skin irritant.
Unsafe.

46:47.158 --> 46:50.252
Eye irritant.
Skin irritant.
Unsafe.

46:50.328 --> 46:52.762
Keep away
from all body parts."

46:54.832 --> 46:55.992
Wanna try it?

46:56.868 --> 46:58.028
What, do you drink it?

46:59.270 --> 47:00.396
Sniff it.

47:08.012 --> 47:11.345
<i>Mike, I'm sorry
Antonio's a fuckin'
asshole, man.</i>

47:11.415 --> 47:15.010
<i>He's not always like that.
It's just when he gets
around people and shit.</i>

47:15.086 --> 47:16.678
Fuck him.

47:16.754 --> 47:20.690
You're always
fuckin' afraid of him.
Give me that shit, man.

47:21.726 --> 47:23.421
<i>No, I'm not afraid.</i>

47:23.494 --> 47:25.325
He's a dick.

47:31.736 --> 47:33.033
Fuck him.

47:37.375 --> 47:40.037
I'm scared, Mike.
It's just--

47:40.111 --> 47:43.410
I'm sorry.
I don't even fuckin' know
what I'm saying when smoking.

47:44.749 --> 47:47.217
What the fuck
are you sorry for, Mike?

47:47.285 --> 47:50.914
If some guys were after me
like that, I would be
shitting myself.

47:54.458 --> 47:56.824
California's probably
the best, right?

47:58.629 --> 48:00.654
I always think
about that place.

48:00.731 --> 48:02.164
Well, let's go, then.

48:02.233 --> 48:03.222
What do you mean?

48:03.301 --> 48:04.996
Let's just fucking go.

48:05.636 --> 48:09.003
I saw this, uh,
TV commercial, right?

48:09.073 --> 48:12.372
You can take like a,
a bus, right?

48:12.443 --> 48:14.308
It's $39.

48:15.947 --> 48:17.505
$39?

48:18.916 --> 48:20.577
That's crazy.

48:23.254 --> 48:28.021
Hey, is your fuckin' head
going like boom, boom, boom?
Like hard.

48:59.490 --> 49:00.855
Laurie.

49:03.327 --> 49:04.589
Laurie?

49:05.863 --> 49:07.387
You're so stupid.

49:07.465 --> 49:08.454
<i>Uh?</i>

49:08.532 --> 49:10.693
Hey, stupid,
I'm not talking to you.

49:10.768 --> 49:12.326
I'm still not gonna
talk to you.

49:12.403 --> 49:14.098
<i>Come on.</i>

49:14.839 --> 49:17.205
<i>I'm not talking.
Why are you here?</i>

49:17.274 --> 49:18.673
Why are you even here?

49:18.743 --> 49:20.176
'Cause I wanna be here.

49:20.244 --> 49:21.905
Yeah?

49:21.979 --> 49:23.776
Yeah.

49:27.918 --> 49:30.079
What's wrong?
Why are you still mad?

49:31.122 --> 49:34.785
You forgot, right?
You let Giuseppe throw knives
at me and Diane.

49:34.859 --> 49:36.622
You still mad
about that?

49:36.694 --> 49:44.157
Like, I'm not even mad.
I just feel like the whole shit
was stupid, you know?

49:46.203 --> 49:48.671
Hello?
Shit.

49:50.341 --> 49:51.831
You're drunk.

49:51.909 --> 49:53.638
No.

49:53.711 --> 49:54.803
Oh, shit.

49:55.579 --> 49:57.979
You're stoned.
Yeah, you are.

49:58.049 --> 49:59.073
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

49:59.150 --> 50:00.617
You are.

50:01.252 --> 50:03.311
You know what I'm gonna do
if you let me in?

50:03.421 --> 50:06.254
No.
What you gonna do?

50:08.059 --> 50:09.856
I'm not even
gonna fuck you.

50:09.927 --> 50:12.794
Wow! You're not
gonna even fuck me!

50:13.464 --> 50:14.692
Not even if I let you in?

50:17.568 --> 50:19.195
I'm just gonna lick
your pussy.

50:19.270 --> 50:20.760
Oh, my God.

50:20.838 --> 50:23.671
My mother's like right there.
She can hear you right now.

50:23.741 --> 50:24.935
You know why?

50:27.011 --> 50:28.569
No, why?

50:29.280 --> 50:30.542
Why what?

50:33.350 --> 50:34.783
What are you talking about?

50:34.852 --> 50:37.753
I don't know--
I don't know why
you're gonna lick my pussy.

50:37.822 --> 50:40.017
That's what you wanted me
to say.

50:40.091 --> 50:41.217
Because, uhm,

50:41.292 --> 50:45.558
I'm gonna lick your pussy
because me and Mike
we're going to California

50:45.629 --> 50:46.994
with our band and shit.

50:47.064 --> 50:49.897
I want you to come, you know,
because I love you.

50:49.967 --> 50:52.367
Because the fuckin' Mets won.

50:52.436 --> 50:54.996
What?
What did you say?

50:56.273 --> 50:57.900
You said you love me.

50:57.975 --> 50:58.999
What?

50:59.076 --> 51:01.067
You said you love me, right?

51:03.781 --> 51:06.477
I'm serious.
That shit means
a lot to me, you know.

51:09.453 --> 51:11.717
I love you.
I don't why.
I love you.

51:11.789 --> 51:13.723
'Cause I love you.
'Cause--

51:14.859 --> 51:16.451
I can't.

51:17.628 --> 51:19.528
Stupid.

51:28.305 --> 51:30.535
<i>Hey, yo.
Hey, yo,</i>

51:30.608 --> 51:32.872
I stole us a Spalding
from Fishbein's.

51:32.943 --> 51:35.912
I swear that fuckin' Charlie
his getting blind as he can be.

51:35.980 --> 51:38.278
I can't wait to get
that motherfucker.

51:38.349 --> 51:40.874
I would play.
I just gotta go back.

51:40.951 --> 51:42.509
I gotta go
to the city right now.

51:42.586 --> 51:45.953
What do you wanna go
to Manhattan for?
Monty wanted to play handball.

51:46.023 --> 51:47.285
You okay?
What happened?

51:47.358 --> 51:50.225
It was my fuckin' father.
You wanna go first
to the park?

51:50.294 --> 51:52.728
No, I gotta fu--
I gotta go fuckin'
with the dogs.

51:52.797 --> 51:54.526
Mike with the dogs?
Come on.
Hey!

51:54.598 --> 51:57.328
Maybe you could see
if I can get a job there, man.

51:57.401 --> 51:59.995
Tell your friend
I ain't gonna fuck
with him, right?

52:00.070 --> 52:02.698
Maybe we can hang out later.

52:07.578 --> 52:08.977
Look who's here.

52:09.046 --> 52:10.946
<i>Sorry.
I got lost
changing trains.</i>

52:11.015 --> 52:15.247
Take little Geronimo here.
You got to go
through the teeth over here.

52:16.754 --> 52:20.383
Look at Young Geronimo.
Careful, motherfucker.
The teeth are lethal.

52:20.457 --> 52:25.087
Take Bobo and Lulu too,
because Miss Levitt will have
a fuckin' heart attack.

52:25.162 --> 52:28.290
You gotta go through here.
Merry-go-round.

52:28.365 --> 52:31.198
Could they make it
a little more heat
in this city or what?

52:31.268 --> 52:33.293
Sorry, he's blind.
Poor kid.

52:33.370 --> 52:35.964
So this guy
has a Pomeranian.
Marilyn.

52:36.040 --> 52:39.407
You gotta walk the thing
sometimes for like an hour
before it craps.

52:39.476 --> 52:43.310
On 2nd Avenue.
Bobby, the owner, he can be
a real pain in the ass.

52:43.380 --> 52:47.976
He'll check the dog's ass.
Make sure it just does it.
Okay?

52:48.052 --> 52:49.679
Thank you, ma'am.
They're okay.

52:49.753 --> 52:52.085
Those things always end up
with you going to hell.

52:52.156 --> 52:54.784
So, remember he's like
an entertainment manager,

52:54.859 --> 52:57.555
or like he owns a store
or something.
Fish and lizards.

52:57.628 --> 52:59.357
But music, too.
Whatever.

52:59.430 --> 53:01.364
I told him about you guys
and the music,

53:01.432 --> 53:04.765
and that maybe
he should do something.
You never know, okay?

53:04.835 --> 53:08.771
I gotta head downtown.
Mikey, you have the address.
You can walk from here.

53:08.839 --> 53:11.967
And break the leg.
That's what they say
in the big time.

53:12.042 --> 53:13.839
Cheerio, Frank.

53:21.685 --> 53:24.677
Your mothers must be
really proud of you.

53:33.197 --> 53:35.961
I could jump from one side
to the other like this.

53:36.033 --> 53:38.797
Jesse Owens would've.
You're not a track star, man.

53:38.869 --> 53:41.633
I'm sorry.
I hate to tell you this.
You're not making it.

53:46.110 --> 53:47.907
What you think,
you cute Giuseppe?

53:47.978 --> 53:50.310
I'm not cute.
I'm handsome.

53:50.381 --> 53:51.712
<i>Who the fuck
told you that?</i>

53:51.782 --> 53:53.545
Girls.

53:53.617 --> 53:55.812
Go get my ball, man.

53:55.886 --> 53:58.616
<i>Go get my--
Go get my ball.</i>

54:00.257 --> 54:02.725
Hey, Bobby.

54:02.793 --> 54:05.023
This is Dito.

54:05.095 --> 54:07.188
Hey, there.
I'll bring him right back.

54:07.264 --> 54:08.595
Thanks.

54:08.666 --> 54:09.826
Let's go.

54:09.900 --> 54:13.028
No, don't fuck with that.
Come on, man.

54:13.103 --> 54:16.197
Touch it
with your finger.
With your finger.

54:16.273 --> 54:17.900
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

54:17.975 --> 54:22.207
I heard if you put both feet
on it at the same time,
nothing happens.

54:22.279 --> 54:24.873
You like conduct
electricity and shit.

54:24.949 --> 54:27.577
What are you Einstein?
You sound like an idiot.

54:31.021 --> 54:33.387
<i>You're worried about me,
Antonio, aren't you?</i>

54:33.457 --> 54:35.652
Am I fuckin' worried
about you?

54:35.726 --> 54:40.186
<i>The fuckin' train is coming.
I don't give a fuck about you.
Get my ball, man.</i>

54:40.264 --> 54:41.891
You don't give a shit?

54:43.434 --> 54:46.369
Now how about
giving a shit?

54:46.437 --> 54:49.406
The fuckin' train is coming.
You don't see it?

54:49.473 --> 54:51.168
Tell me you're worried
about me.

54:51.241 --> 54:54.768
<i>I don't give a fuck about you.
If you wanna die, go ahead.
Go ahead.</i>

54:54.845 --> 54:57.109
You're not gonna tell me
you're worried about me?

54:57.181 --> 54:59.945
What the fuck?
Come on, man.
Get the fuck up here.

55:00.017 --> 55:03.282
What the fuck are you doing?
The train's coming
right at you.

55:03.354 --> 55:05.322
You're my brother.

55:05.389 --> 55:07.448
The fuckin' train.
It's right there.

55:07.524 --> 55:10.755
<i>You're gonna be retarded
and just sit down?
I don't give a fuck.</i>

55:10.828 --> 55:14.594
Get the fuck out already.
Get the fuck out!

55:14.665 --> 55:17.225
<i>Go!
Get the fuck out!</i>

55:44.428 --> 55:46.225
I was calling.
You okay?

55:46.296 --> 55:47.320
Yeah, I'm fine.

55:47.398 --> 55:51.562
When I call you,
you always call me back.
I got worried.

55:52.603 --> 55:53.831
This is messed up, huh?

55:53.904 --> 55:57.067
It's fucked up.
It's just fucked up.

55:59.443 --> 56:03.345
I'm getting out of here.
Me and Mike we're leaving.
We're going to California.

56:03.414 --> 56:07.145
I know.
Remember you told me?
You wanted me to go with you.

56:07.217 --> 56:08.548
Yeah.

56:08.619 --> 56:11.645
What?
You don't want me
to go with you?

56:11.722 --> 56:13.690
Is that what you're saying?

56:13.757 --> 56:15.987
I want to talk
to Antonio.

56:16.060 --> 56:17.584
I'm just going to talk.

56:17.661 --> 56:20.892
Why can't you even look
at me right now?
You're not looking at me.

56:20.964 --> 56:23.023
How do you mean?
How else can I look at you?

56:23.100 --> 56:26.194
You said that
you loved me, right?
Did you mean that?

56:26.270 --> 56:29.706
<i>Laurie, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna talk to Antonio.</i>

56:29.773 --> 56:32.435
You better not.
You better talk to me right now.

56:39.483 --> 56:42.179
You okay?
You okay?

56:42.252 --> 56:45.983
Don't worry about it.
What are you going to do?
It's fucked up.

56:46.056 --> 56:48.752
He's, he's fucking--
He's stupid.

56:48.826 --> 56:51.488
It's just fuckin'--
Now he's dead
and he's stupid.

56:51.562 --> 56:54.759
You know Giuseppe.
He's fuckin',
he's an idiot.

56:54.832 --> 56:57.892
I found out
where the fuckin'
Reaper guy is.

56:57.968 --> 57:01.870
I found him for sure this time.
I know where they hang out.

57:01.939 --> 57:04.669
Don't worry about that, either.
I'm gonna kill his ass.

57:04.741 --> 57:08.040
I'm here for Giuseppe.
Antonio, you're here
for your brother.

57:08.112 --> 57:09.807
That's your brother
in a box.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.177
That's your brother.

57:11.248 --> 57:14.911
Is that all you think about,
the Reaper guy?
It's your brother's funeral.

57:14.985 --> 57:18.250
What the fuck do you mean,
"Is that all I ever
fuckin' think about?

57:18.322 --> 57:20.290
What do you mean?

57:21.992 --> 57:23.687
What do you mean by that?

57:24.495 --> 57:25.621
What'd I say?

57:25.696 --> 57:29.996
All I ever think about is you?
Is that what you're saying?
I think about you?

57:30.901 --> 57:33.893
I'm asking you
a fuckin' question.
What did you mean by that?

57:33.971 --> 57:36.098
I didn't mean
anything by it.

57:36.173 --> 57:39.108
Get the fuck out!
I don't even fuckin' care
about you!

57:39.176 --> 57:42.168
I don't fuckin' even care.
Do you hear me?
I don't give a fuck.

57:42.246 --> 57:43.804
<i>Antonio!</i>

57:43.881 --> 57:45.473
I'm sorry, Monty.

57:47.017 --> 57:48.985
Fuck!
Fuck!

57:57.661 --> 57:58.992
You alright?

58:22.619 --> 58:24.143
Hey.

58:24.221 --> 58:28.419
Do you know this used to be
a candy store here?
Can you believe it?

58:49.646 --> 58:52.706
What does the Stop mean?
Do you see the hand?

58:52.783 --> 58:54.114
Stop!

58:54.184 --> 58:56.914
It means you don't cross
the street.
You stop.

58:58.255 --> 58:59.517
Go.

58:59.590 --> 59:03.185
Yo! Don't be making
no transactions
on my corner here, alright?

59:05.295 --> 59:06.762
<i>Yo.</i>

59:08.298 --> 59:12.064
Fuckin' Hector.
Little kids here, man.

59:12.135 --> 59:15.263
I'm serious.
I'm serious, Hector.

59:16.440 --> 59:19.136
Fuckin' television.
Yo, that works?

59:19.209 --> 59:22.201
<i>Hey, is that's flat screen?</i>

59:22.279 --> 59:25.271
<i>Yo, I'm serious.
That works?</i>

59:32.489 --> 59:34.354
<i>You used to be a swimmer?</i>

59:34.424 --> 59:37.086
Oh, you used to be
a swimmer, right?

59:40.297 --> 59:43.730
Hey.

59:44.801 --> 59:45.859
Who's that?

59:45.936 --> 59:48.905
Shit.
This is Joey.
Look.

59:48.972 --> 59:50.803
Joseph.
Mr. Joey.

59:52.576 --> 59:54.203
Joey, like Giuseppe?

59:57.247 --> 59:59.078
Like Joseph.

59:59.149 --> 01:00:00.844
It's his father's name.
Joseph.

01:00:00.917 --> 01:00:02.248
<i>Mommy, who's that man?</i>

01:00:02.319 --> 01:00:05.379
<i>He's gone now.
He wants to know
who you are.</i>

01:00:05.455 --> 01:00:08.447
<i>I've known your mother
since she was, like,
she was this big.</i>

01:00:08.525 --> 01:00:10.891
<i>She can't be this big,
you know.</i>

01:00:13.263 --> 01:00:15.595
Your mom said
you were coming into town.

01:00:15.666 --> 01:00:17.531
Yeah, I'm gonna see
my father.

01:00:18.502 --> 01:00:21.437
<i>Yeah, Nerf told me,
you know, you'd be here
in your corner.</i>

01:00:21.505 --> 01:00:23.473
<i>My corner.
Nerf.</i>

01:00:25.976 --> 01:00:27.068
Wow.

01:00:28.011 --> 01:00:29.638
Wow.

01:00:29.713 --> 01:00:32.580
Laurie, you look beautiful.

01:00:32.649 --> 01:00:34.480
<i>You know, I'm in my bests.</i>

01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:37.179
I'm looking really good.
My best slippers.

01:00:37.254 --> 01:00:39.552
You should see them actually.
Manolo's.

01:00:42.125 --> 01:00:44.457
<i>You're staying
at your mother's, right?</i>

01:00:44.528 --> 01:00:45.790
Nerf's.

01:00:45.862 --> 01:00:48.228
Nerf's mother's.
Alright.

01:00:48.298 --> 01:00:50.892
Yeah.
Alright.

01:00:50.967 --> 01:00:55.267
I'll be around, you know.
Maybe later I'll come back
or you wanna come down.

01:00:55.339 --> 01:00:56.806
You wanna come down
and play.

01:00:58.709 --> 01:01:02.076
It was really nice to see you.
I gotta make dinner now.

01:01:02.779 --> 01:01:04.337
<i>It's good to see you.</i>

01:01:05.549 --> 01:01:07.813
Alright.
See you, Mr. Joey.

01:01:39.716 --> 01:01:42.549
Antonio.
Yo!

01:01:43.286 --> 01:01:44.651
Antonio.

01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:47.347
Yo, Antonio.

01:01:47.424 --> 01:01:49.016
<i>Yo, Dito,
what's up, man?</i>

01:01:49.092 --> 01:01:50.923
Come on.
I'm sorry.

01:01:50.994 --> 01:01:53.053
<i>What's up, Dito?
Where the fuck you been?</i>

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:56.725
I know where he's been,
since he's all I have
to think about.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.290
He's all I have
to think about.

01:01:58.368 --> 01:01:59.460
I'm fuckin' working.

01:01:59.536 --> 01:02:01.697
What are you always
fuckin' pissed off for?

01:02:01.772 --> 01:02:05.139
I'm not pissed off.
You know your father
had a seizure?

01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:08.575
This guy don't even know
his fuckin' father
had a seizure.

01:02:08.645 --> 01:02:10.704
He's acting like
there's nothing wrong.

01:02:10.781 --> 01:02:12.578
You're in fuckin' Niggerville.

01:02:12.649 --> 01:02:15.140
Nerf's dad is black.
What happened to my father?

01:02:15.218 --> 01:02:16.583
My father's Dominican.

01:02:16.653 --> 01:02:18.985
Nerf's fuckin' Nerf, man.

01:02:19.055 --> 01:02:21.785
<i>You're never around anymore.
Where the fuck were you?</i>

01:02:21.858 --> 01:02:23.723
Where the fuck are you?
Nowhere!

01:02:24.461 --> 01:02:26.258
This fuckin' guy.
Come on, let's go.

01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:28.490
I don't fuckin' know you
anymore!

01:02:28.565 --> 01:02:30.260
Yo, tell me who the fuck--

01:02:30.333 --> 01:02:33.200
Look, yo,
you don't think
I'd fuck you up?

01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:34.328
Chill out, Antonio.

01:02:34.404 --> 01:02:38.602
You have no idea
how fuckin' close you are.
Nerf, let's just fuckin' go.

01:02:39.342 --> 01:02:40.434
<i>Antonio!</i>

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:43.172
Nerf.
Nerf!

01:03:02.666 --> 01:03:05.499
What's up, motherfucker?
Think you can hide from me?

01:03:05.569 --> 01:03:07.833
Think you can fuck
with my family?

01:03:07.904 --> 01:03:10.134
Think you can fuck
with my family, nigger?

01:03:16.112 --> 01:03:18.478
Don't fuck with me
'cause I know your family.

01:03:18.548 --> 01:03:20.743
I know your father.
I know where you live.

01:03:21.852 --> 01:03:24.878
Don't fuck with TSS!
Next time I'll kill you.
That's my word.

01:03:24.955 --> 01:03:29.324
I know your family.
I know you live right here.
Don't ever fuck with me!

01:03:30.594 --> 01:03:31.720
Hurry up.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.963
You're scared.

01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:45.506
<i>Yo!
What the fuck, man?</i>

01:03:46.443 --> 01:03:48.001
Yo!
Yo, yo, yo yo.

01:03:48.078 --> 01:03:50.239
Just-- just fuckin' lay there
for a second.

01:03:51.381 --> 01:03:53.611
Yo, come here.
Come here.
Look at me.

01:03:53.683 --> 01:03:55.480
Oh, fuck.
He fucked up.

01:03:55.552 --> 01:03:56.644
Don't be mad, okay?

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.517
No, no.
Nerf, get your mother's car.

01:03:58.588 --> 01:04:00.749
Go get your mother's car
right now.

01:04:00.824 --> 01:04:04.351
You're fucked up.
That fuckin'.
It's--

01:04:07.063 --> 01:04:09.293
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

01:04:19.709 --> 01:04:23.270
<i>Every day something's different
with you guys.
I don't know what it is.</i>

01:04:23.346 --> 01:04:26.873
Every day is something, huh?
Right, Antonio?
Every day is something.

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:28.474
Yeah.

01:04:30.987 --> 01:04:34.150
<i>So what happened this time?
A dog bite you?
Huh?</i>

01:04:34.224 --> 01:04:35.953
I told you I fell off
a park fence.

01:04:36.026 --> 01:04:38.187
Oh, you fell off a fence?

01:04:40.163 --> 01:04:42.996
Never mind about that, okay?
Just tell me what happened.

01:04:45.902 --> 01:04:47.130
Hi.

01:04:47.203 --> 01:04:48.864
It's 2:00 in the morning.

01:04:48.939 --> 01:04:51.271
<i>I just wanted to see
what happened.</i>

01:04:53.476 --> 01:04:55.034
Sorry.

01:04:55.111 --> 01:04:57.045
What happened?

01:04:57.981 --> 01:05:00.472
There, now you see.
Now go.

01:05:02.052 --> 01:05:04.816
I said I just want to know
what happened.

01:05:04.888 --> 01:05:09.222
The freaking graffiti guys.
You know, the Reaper.
Your fuckin' race.

01:05:09.292 --> 01:05:10.987
They whacked him
with a bat.

01:05:11.061 --> 01:05:12.858
<i>It's not my race.</i>

01:05:12.929 --> 01:05:16.365
<i>Monty?
What are you doing out there?</i>

01:05:16.433 --> 01:05:20.631
Uh, don't worry, Flori.
I'm talking to Dito
and Antonio, okay?

01:05:20.704 --> 01:05:23.502
<i>It's so late!</i>

01:05:24.808 --> 01:05:27.606
These guys, they knew
who you were, too.

01:05:27.677 --> 01:05:29.668
The Reaper guy.
The bat man.

01:05:29.746 --> 01:05:32.874
But don't worry about it.
We'll take care of it.
Just trust me.

01:05:32.949 --> 01:05:34.177
<i>Why do they care
who I am?</i>

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:37.845
They care who you are.
These guys
are crazy, Mr. Montiel.

01:05:40.624 --> 01:05:46.119
Daddy, me and Mike are planning
a trip to go to California
for a month.

01:05:46.196 --> 01:05:50.098
Listen to Antonio, okay?
What do you mean
you wanna go somewhere?

01:05:50.166 --> 01:05:52.191
You wanna go to China,
go to China Town.

01:05:52.268 --> 01:05:54.702
You don't even listen
to anything.

01:05:54.771 --> 01:05:58.036
<i>I'm sorry.
I just feel you're not listening
to what he's saying.</i>

01:05:58.108 --> 01:05:59.769
<i>Sorry, daddy.
I'm serious.</i>

01:05:59.843 --> 01:06:02.505
<i>You said to me that
if I were to leave,</i>

01:06:02.579 --> 01:06:04.774
that you wouldn't talk
to me anymore.

01:06:04.848 --> 01:06:06.975
And if I were to go,
would you not talk to me?

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:09.018
That's what you said
you were gonna do.

01:06:09.085 --> 01:06:11.610
But you're not going
anywhere, Dito.

01:06:12.956 --> 01:06:17.052
You're not going anywhere.
You stay right here at home
with us, okay?

01:06:17.694 --> 01:06:20.094
<i>Daddy, can you be
my fuckin' father
for a second?</i>

01:06:20.163 --> 01:06:24.327
<i>I wanna go somewhere.
I wanna do something for once.
I can't be here anymore.</i>

01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:25.595
It's a nightmare here.

01:06:25.669 --> 01:06:27.398
<i>What's going on out there?</i>

01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:30.200
Flori, wait a minute.
Everything's gonna be alright.

01:06:30.273 --> 01:06:32.867
Who do you think you are
talking to me like that?

01:06:32.942 --> 01:06:34.068
<i>He's your son.</i>

01:06:34.144 --> 01:06:37.170
Just mind your business.
I told you to mind
your business.

01:06:37.247 --> 01:06:39.306
Alright.
You wanna go,
then go!

01:06:39.382 --> 01:06:41.475
Is that what you wanna hear?
Then go.

01:06:41.551 --> 01:06:43.815
Don't you ever talk to me
like that again.

01:06:43.887 --> 01:06:46.822
Antonio is gonna make
everything right.
Right, Antonio?

01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:50.587
He's gonna make it right. Yes!
He's gonna make it right!

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:52.059
He's gonna take care, okay?

01:06:52.162 --> 01:06:55.154
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
Listen to him.
Why don't you leave my fuckin house?

01:06:55.965 --> 01:06:58.695
Listen to me.
Antonio, you are going
to make it right?

01:06:58.768 --> 01:07:00.531
You're gonna make it
right, right?

01:07:00.637 --> 01:07:02.832
He's not going nowhere.

01:07:02.906 --> 01:07:06.967
Get the fuck out of my house!
Get the fuck out of my house.

01:07:07.043 --> 01:07:10.308
Hey, hey.
Hey!
What are you doing?

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.076
Get the fuck out.
I hate you!

01:07:13.149 --> 01:07:16.380
<i>What the hell
are you saying to me?
You hate your father?</i>

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:19.479
<i>Hey, fuck, relax!</i>

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:21.882
Monty?

01:07:34.437 --> 01:07:35.699
Hold his head!

01:07:41.244 --> 01:07:43.974
<i>Dito, where are you going?</i>

01:07:45.115 --> 01:07:46.377
What is happening?

01:07:54.958 --> 01:07:57.756
You'll be alright.
You'll be alright.

01:07:59.295 --> 01:08:00.785
You'll be alright.

01:08:59.589 --> 01:09:01.147
Dito.

01:09:03.225 --> 01:09:04.716
Hi.

01:09:06.029 --> 01:09:08.122
Dito.

01:09:08.198 --> 01:09:09.688
Come here.

01:09:15.738 --> 01:09:17.330
Look at you.

01:09:17.407 --> 01:09:19.033
You're beautiful.

01:09:25.314 --> 01:09:26.942
Momma, you do.

01:09:33.389 --> 01:09:34.377
Monty?

01:09:36.392 --> 01:09:39.361
Monty.
Look who's here.

01:09:45.234 --> 01:09:47.725
Hey.
Look at you.

01:09:47.804 --> 01:09:49.362
Long time no see.

01:09:57.013 --> 01:09:58.173
Daddy.

01:09:59.082 --> 01:10:01.642
Antonio and Nerf called.
Said you were sick.

01:10:04.888 --> 01:10:07.652
Me?
Rock of Gibraltar, man.

01:10:15.431 --> 01:10:17.058
You don't look so good.

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:24.597
He came all this way to tell me
I don't look so good, Flori?

01:10:28.745 --> 01:10:30.076
No.

01:10:31.147 --> 01:10:35.140
He's here to take you
to the hospital
because you're sick, right?

01:10:39.422 --> 01:10:43.017
Well... thanks for coming.
You take care, okay?

01:10:43.993 --> 01:10:45.358
Take care?

01:10:45.428 --> 01:10:47.362
When I came
all the way here
to see you?

01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:50.558
<i>Dito, it's nice
to see you again.</i>

01:10:50.633 --> 01:10:52.863
You came and everything.
Now you take care.

01:10:52.936 --> 01:10:54.995
I see what he's doing.

01:10:55.772 --> 01:10:58.570
<i>Nice.
I see what you're doing.</i>

01:10:59.208 --> 01:11:01.574
That's because
you're a very smart guy.

01:11:01.644 --> 01:11:05.978
<i>Well, I'm your son.
You know that, right?</i>

01:11:06.049 --> 01:11:07.482
<i>You're my son?</i>

01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:09.074
Yeah, I'm your son.
Remember?

01:11:09.152 --> 01:11:12.212
<i>You're my son?
You're not my son.</i>

01:11:15.224 --> 01:11:17.488
I'm not gonna fight.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.084
You want me to leave?

01:11:19.162 --> 01:11:21.027
<i>Big shot comes here.</i>

01:11:22.532 --> 01:11:26.059
<i>Comes 15,
comes 3,000 miles.</i>

01:11:26.135 --> 01:11:30.663
<i>From co--
Comes 3,000 miles
in 15 years.</i>

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:34.073
<i>You go back to California
like the rat you are.</i>

01:11:34.143 --> 01:11:37.544
You leave me,
your mother.

01:11:37.613 --> 01:11:40.639
<i>You don't see
your friend Antonio.</i>

01:11:40.717 --> 01:11:41.911
Monty.

01:11:41.985 --> 01:11:45.250
<i>Not once!
Once!</i>

01:11:48.391 --> 01:11:51.451
You can go.
You take care.

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:33.334
Used to be Antonio's house.

01:12:33.403 --> 01:12:35.871
House of horrors.
The poor kid.

01:12:37.907 --> 01:12:40.398
Look how nice
it is now.

01:12:40.476 --> 01:12:42.137
It's nice, huh?

01:12:46.949 --> 01:12:50.476
I wasn't upset
when he went to prison.
Not a bit.

01:12:50.553 --> 01:12:52.851
That's where me
and you father are different.

01:12:56.292 --> 01:13:02.253
You know, if you hooked
your father up
to a lie detector test

01:13:02.331 --> 01:13:07.166
and asked if he was
the best father
whoever lived ever,

01:13:07.236 --> 01:13:09.966
he'd pass with flying colors.

01:13:11.574 --> 01:13:15.601
That's because he loved you
with everything he had.

01:13:15.678 --> 01:13:18.476
Every last bit.
He loved you.

01:13:19.782 --> 01:13:22.148
He loved coming up here
with you.

01:13:25.421 --> 01:13:28.857
You know, people used to think
he was your grandfather.

01:13:29.926 --> 01:13:32.087
He thought that was funny.

01:13:32.161 --> 01:13:37.463
You know, one generation
can be funny, I guess.
But two?

01:13:37.533 --> 01:13:40.798
We were too old
to have such a young boy.

01:13:44.807 --> 01:13:50.211
We needed you probably more
than you needed us.
Or, you know.

01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:54.074
Your father was so crazy
about you.

01:13:54.150 --> 01:13:56.744
I never saw nothing like it.

01:13:59.355 --> 01:14:01.550
You were more his buddy
than a son.

01:14:01.624 --> 01:14:04.388
He couldn't wait for you
to come out and play.

01:14:08.531 --> 01:14:10.226
I'm sorry, Ma.

01:14:12.468 --> 01:14:17.496
You can't come back
with hatred for your father.
You can't.

01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:23.907
How could you love him so much
in that book and not see him
for so long?

01:14:28.417 --> 01:14:30.908
I know you have your reasons.

01:14:33.022 --> 01:14:35.081
We all missed you here.

01:14:36.492 --> 01:14:38.255
You're my son, too.

01:14:43.833 --> 01:14:45.266
Look at you.

01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:49.667
You're a man now.

01:15:02.552 --> 01:15:04.884
It's good to see you again.

01:15:06.689 --> 01:15:09.556
To say your name
to you.

01:15:21.737 --> 01:15:24.763
I thought of this every day,
and now it's here.

01:15:26.042 --> 01:15:27.634
Every day.

01:15:39.288 --> 01:15:40.619
You asked your dad, right?

01:15:41.958 --> 01:15:44.893
How can we afford California?

01:15:46.862 --> 01:15:48.056
Frank.

01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:51.725
Remember the commercial
you told me about?
You told me about that.

01:15:52.501 --> 01:15:54.867
I saw it.
The $39-buses.

01:15:55.771 --> 01:15:57.796
We get the money from Frank
and we can go.

01:16:00.109 --> 01:16:03.044
Hey, Ronnie,
give her her shirt back.

01:16:03.112 --> 01:16:05.603
I just wanna get
the fuck out of here.

01:16:06.749 --> 01:16:09.980
I'm not gonna go without you.
And we're going, right?

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:12.517
Yeah.

01:16:15.024 --> 01:16:16.616
I want my fuckin' shirt back.

01:16:16.692 --> 01:16:19.183
Can you give her back
her frigging shirt?

01:16:19.262 --> 01:16:23.392
<i>I'm serious, Ronnie.
I'm serious.
Ronnie!</i>

01:16:26.636 --> 01:16:30.629
Ronnie!
Give her the fuckin'
shirt back.

01:16:30.706 --> 01:16:33.971
Why you do this every time?
Fuckin' little pervert.

01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:35.804
Here.

01:16:35.878 --> 01:16:38.642
<i>I gave you your shirt.
Tell your friend
to talk to me.</i>

01:16:38.714 --> 01:16:40.841
Your friend has a mind
of her own.

01:16:40.916 --> 01:16:42.747
Tell your mind
to talk to me.

01:16:42.818 --> 01:16:46.914
My mind is not
gonna talk to you.
I don't wanna talk to you.

01:16:46.989 --> 01:16:49.287
<i>You don't think
I'm not gonna get
in there now?</i>

01:16:49.358 --> 01:16:50.723
<i>You're not gonna get in.</i>

01:16:54.997 --> 01:16:57.090
You didn't think
I was gonna get in?

01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.128
Huh?

01:17:01.337 --> 01:17:04.738
I'm sorry, Laurie.
At my fuckin' house
I didn't mean to--

01:17:07.643 --> 01:17:08.940
I didn't mean to.

01:17:09.011 --> 01:17:12.003
You were so mean to me.
You were really mean to me.

01:17:12.081 --> 01:17:13.275
I was pissed off.

01:17:13.349 --> 01:17:16.079
I was pissed off.
I lost it, you know.
I fuckin'--

01:17:18.587 --> 01:17:19.952
What is that?

01:17:21.257 --> 01:17:23.782
Is that a bruise?
I did that to you?

01:17:23.859 --> 01:17:25.292
Yeah.

01:17:25.361 --> 01:17:27.386
Don't worry.
I bruise easily.
It's fine.

01:17:27.463 --> 01:17:28.760
When I grabbed you?

01:17:29.999 --> 01:17:31.432
Yo, Dito.

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:35.994
The Reaper's over there.
Let's go.
Get up out of the pool.

01:17:36.072 --> 01:17:40.202
<i>Antonio found the dude
that hit you with the bat.
He's waiting for you.</i>

01:17:40.276 --> 01:17:42.540
Come on!

01:17:42.611 --> 01:17:44.738
You going over there
is so fuckin' stupid.

01:17:44.814 --> 01:17:46.372
Let's go!
Dito, come on, man.

01:17:46.449 --> 01:17:50.010
You don't need
that fuckin' asshole.
He is the fuckin' worst!

01:17:50.086 --> 01:17:53.283
<i>Where are you going?
You're so full of shit, man.</i>

01:17:53.356 --> 01:17:56.450
You wanna get out of here,
but you're running
after Antonio.

01:17:56.525 --> 01:18:00.484
<i>The guy's a fuckin' dick, Dito.
It's because of him
you're fucked up.</i>

01:18:00.563 --> 01:18:02.690
Fuckin' go then!
Go!

01:18:02.765 --> 01:18:03.754
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

01:18:03.833 --> 01:18:05.698
You're not coming back!

01:18:27.823 --> 01:18:29.484
What's up, Dito?

01:18:29.558 --> 01:18:31.958
The fuckin' spic
is right there, man.

01:18:33.596 --> 01:18:35.029
Nerf told you, right?

01:18:35.097 --> 01:18:36.325
Yeah.

01:18:36.399 --> 01:18:38.367
That's our motherfucker
right there.

01:18:42.071 --> 01:18:44.096
He's in there playing Asteroids.

01:18:49.412 --> 01:18:51.039
Yo, get down.
Get down.

01:18:54.316 --> 01:18:56.443
Yeah, let him go.
Let him go.

01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:02.987
He'll be there
all alone.

01:19:04.827 --> 01:19:06.692
I'm gonna show this fucker
what's up.

01:19:53.843 --> 01:19:55.572
<i>Frank?</i>

01:19:56.712 --> 01:19:58.236
<i>Frank?</i>

01:20:13.362 --> 01:20:14.420
Oh, shit.

01:20:16.899 --> 01:20:19.891
<i>What's up?
Is it Saturday?</i>

01:20:21.403 --> 01:20:22.870
It ain't Saturday, Frank.

01:20:24.406 --> 01:20:26.840
Sit down.
Sit down.

01:20:29.211 --> 01:20:32.578
Frank, we need our money.
Remember I was telling you--

01:20:32.648 --> 01:20:35.811
<i>You guys know
this shit's no good.
Huh?</i>

01:20:35.885 --> 01:20:39.286
You like this song?
You can hear it, right?

01:20:40.022 --> 01:20:41.319
<i>Listen, listen, listen.</i>

01:20:43.359 --> 01:20:45.850
Oh, fuck!
Did you hear that?

01:20:46.462 --> 01:20:47.793
Did you hear that?

01:20:49.164 --> 01:20:51.655
<i>It's like--
Oh, I love it.</i>

01:20:56.639 --> 01:20:57.833
<i>Right?</i>

01:21:02.545 --> 01:21:04.979
<i>And these things
like fuckin' ultrasonic.</i>

01:21:05.047 --> 01:21:07.572
<i>They're like
walkie talkie shit.
But in your head.</i>

01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:10.847
Like, it sounds there
but it's in here, too.
You know what I mean?

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.855
It sounds there
but it's in here, too.
You know what I mean?

01:21:13.923 --> 01:21:15.982
<i>Walkie talkie shit,
I'm telling ya.</i>

01:21:16.058 --> 01:21:20.495
<i>Out there, in here.
Out there, in here.
It's amazing.</i>

01:21:20.563 --> 01:21:24.795
Frank, you ain't paid us
for three weeks.

01:21:24.867 --> 01:21:28.359
<i>Damn.
This shit is impossible!
You hear that?</i>

01:21:33.142 --> 01:21:36.202
Come on, Frank.
We know the fuckin' money's
in the fridge.

01:21:36.278 --> 01:21:40.214
Fucking great song.
I love this song.

01:21:40.282 --> 01:21:42.307
I love this song.

01:21:42.384 --> 01:21:46.616
Frank, enough shit already.
The fuckin' money's
in the fridge.

01:21:47.423 --> 01:21:50.358
<i>Either you get it for us
or we're gonna take it.</i>

01:21:50.993 --> 01:21:52.517
What are you gonna do?

01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:55.992
Wait.

01:21:57.466 --> 01:21:59.991
Mikey, you came here
to rob me?

01:22:00.069 --> 01:22:02.435
<i>Frank, we're friends, man.</i>

01:22:02.504 --> 01:22:04.301
I didn't come
to rob you.

01:22:04.373 --> 01:22:06.807
<i>Frank, we didn't come here
to rob you.</i>

01:22:06.875 --> 01:22:08.740
<i>We just want
to get paid, you know.</i>

01:22:08.811 --> 01:22:11.336
<i>You haven't paid us
for three fuckin' weeks.</i>

01:22:11.947 --> 01:22:14.313
Three weeks?
I haven't paid you
in three weeks?

01:22:19.355 --> 01:22:20.879
Okay.

01:22:20.956 --> 01:22:23.584
I mean, it's cool.
It's cool.
I owe you money.

01:22:23.659 --> 01:22:25.627
<i>I mean, you know,</i>

01:22:28.998 --> 01:22:30.625
<i>I got a gun in here too,
you know.</i>

01:22:32.668 --> 01:22:34.659
And if you rob me,
you know,

01:22:36.105 --> 01:22:38.437
<i>I would've had
to have used it.</i>

01:22:40.309 --> 01:22:43.039
But I wouldn't.
I would never.
I'm sorry.

01:22:44.213 --> 01:22:45.646
<i>How much do I owe you?</i>

01:22:47.182 --> 01:22:48.410
Three hundred for both.

01:22:48.484 --> 01:22:49.917
<i>Three hundred.</i>

01:22:51.854 --> 01:22:53.481
You know what?

01:22:54.757 --> 01:22:57.055
Take it all, Mike.
Take it all.

01:22:57.126 --> 01:23:00.823
It's only $300, Frank.
All we want is what we're owed.
We're not asking--

01:23:02.031 --> 01:23:05.899
Like Job.
Remember from the Bible?

01:23:06.735 --> 01:23:10.068
Like him.
You're so good, Mikey.
You're so good.

01:23:10.139 --> 01:23:13.802
<i>But here is no good anymore.
Here is no good.</i>

01:23:13.876 --> 01:23:17.812
You're always talking
about the music,
or California.

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.678
Here's no good anymore, okay?

01:23:20.749 --> 01:23:24.617
Here's no good anymore.
Take it!
Just take the money, please.

01:23:24.687 --> 01:23:25.676
Take the money.

01:23:25.754 --> 01:23:27.415
<i>It's time to go.
Listen to Dito!</i>

01:23:27.489 --> 01:23:30.151
He knows when it's time to go!

01:23:30.225 --> 01:23:31.920
It's time to go.

01:23:32.961 --> 01:23:36.419
<i>Mikey... it's time to go.</i>

01:23:39.401 --> 01:23:40.800
Take it.

01:23:42.337 --> 01:23:43.702
Take it.

01:23:49.144 --> 01:23:50.611
Take it all.

01:23:52.581 --> 01:23:53.912
Take it all.

01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:56.283
It's time to go.

01:24:11.467 --> 01:24:16.427
<i>Yeah, yeah.
That's me.</i>

01:24:17.139 --> 01:24:18.367
Yeah.

01:24:22.978 --> 01:24:28.280
<i>No conscience.
No conscience.
These motherfuckers.</i>

01:24:30.753 --> 01:24:34.154
<i>Do what they want.
Do exactly what they want.</i>

01:24:39.261 --> 01:24:42.958
<i>No conscience.
No conscience.
These motherfuckers.</i>

01:24:43.599 --> 01:24:46.727
<i>You show them what's up.
What's right.</i>

01:24:49.171 --> 01:24:51.571
<i>You go, boy.
You go.</i>

01:24:57.479 --> 01:24:58.468
<i>Pow!</i>

01:25:15.164 --> 01:25:17.928
<i>I was afraid maybe
you drowned in here
or something.</i>

01:25:25.407 --> 01:25:27.432
<i>Listen, Dito.</i>

01:25:29.511 --> 01:25:33.641
Uhm, you know,
this thing with Antonio,
you know,

01:25:38.787 --> 01:25:40.687
<i>you know, don't worry.</i>

01:25:42.157 --> 01:25:43.488
You're kids.

01:25:43.559 --> 01:25:46.119
I spoke to the guy,
the guy with the suit.

01:25:46.195 --> 01:25:48.163
<i>He said everything
is gonna be okay.</i>

01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:50.562
It's gonna be good.
He's gonna take care of it.

01:25:50.632 --> 01:25:52.896
I'm not worried
about it.
Okay?

01:25:56.338 --> 01:25:59.739
I'm sorry I ran away
when you had the seizure, dad.

01:26:06.748 --> 01:26:07.840
Don't worry.

01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:10.484
<i>Monday, instead
of going to school,</i>

01:26:10.552 --> 01:26:13.783
<i>you take your ID card.
You go to Riker's Island,
you see Antonio.</i>

01:26:13.856 --> 01:26:15.915
Take your friend Mike.
He's a good kid.

01:26:16.992 --> 01:26:18.926
Daddy, I wanted
to tell you that--

01:26:18.994 --> 01:26:21.690
<i>I know.
I just want you
to understand everything.</i>

01:26:21.763 --> 01:26:25.028
I like Antonio.
Yeah.

01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.625
Why don't you ever listen
to anything I ever say?

01:26:27.703 --> 01:26:29.762
<i>I'm listening to you.
Listen to me.</i>

01:26:29.838 --> 01:26:33.001
<i>It's gonna be okay.
Alright?</i>

01:26:35.344 --> 01:26:36.606
Don't fuckin' touch me.

01:26:36.678 --> 01:26:37.667
Listen to me.

01:26:37.746 --> 01:26:40.738
Get the fuck off me!
Don't touch me.
Don't fuckin' touch me.

01:26:40.816 --> 01:26:43.046
<i>Don't you talk
to me like that!</i>

01:26:43.118 --> 01:26:46.144
Don't you raise
your voice to me!

01:26:46.221 --> 01:26:48.815
Your my son.
Come on.
Dito.

01:26:48.891 --> 01:26:50.552
Get the fuck off me!

01:26:50.626 --> 01:26:54.562
What's the matter with you?
It's gonna be alright.
Do you hear what I'm saying?

01:26:54.630 --> 01:26:57.155
It's gonna be okay.
It will be okay.

01:26:57.232 --> 01:27:01.430
My friend Mike just died, dad.
He just got fuckin' shot.
You don't know what's happening.

01:27:01.503 --> 01:27:03.494
What are you talking about?
What happened?

01:27:03.572 --> 01:27:05.767
My friend Mike is dead.

01:27:05.841 --> 01:27:06.933
Come here.

01:27:07.009 --> 01:27:10.206
Don't fuckin' touch me!
Please, get the fuck off me!

01:27:10.279 --> 01:27:11.940
What is the matter
with you?

01:27:12.014 --> 01:27:14.175
You don't raise your hands
to your father!

01:27:14.249 --> 01:27:17.776
You don't raise your hands
to your father.
I love you.

01:27:17.853 --> 01:27:20.344
I'm asking you
not to fuckin' touch me!

01:27:20.422 --> 01:27:23.050
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:27:24.626 --> 01:27:27.288
Don't you fuckin' do it!

01:27:27.362 --> 01:27:30.160
Don't you raise your hands
to me again!

01:27:30.933 --> 01:27:32.628
I'm your father.

01:27:33.402 --> 01:27:36.132
You're not supposed
to hate your father.

01:27:36.204 --> 01:27:38.229
When are you my father?

01:27:40.108 --> 01:27:42.338
When are you my father?

01:28:04.967 --> 01:28:06.559
<i>You know, I, uh,</i>

01:28:07.336 --> 01:28:11.568
<i>I waited around for a year
at my window when you left.</i>

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.767
I bought California maps.

01:28:15.844 --> 01:28:18.642
Any time I heard
anything about it,
I would think of you.

01:28:19.982 --> 01:28:21.643
Embarrassing.

01:28:24.119 --> 01:28:25.552
Dumb little girl.

01:28:28.957 --> 01:28:32.393
Listen, I'm not heartbroken
about it, alright?
I'm over that shit.

01:28:33.562 --> 01:28:36.690
I was just a dumb girl.
We were fuckin' kids.
Whatever.

01:28:37.232 --> 01:28:39.700
But you need to take
your father to the hospital.

01:28:42.371 --> 01:28:43.861
<i>I mean, your mother--</i>

01:28:46.408 --> 01:28:48.171
<i>I'm serious.</i>

01:28:49.778 --> 01:28:52.269
<i>I got a little boy.
He's a good kid.</i>

01:28:52.347 --> 01:28:54.781
<i>And he's gonna look after me
when we're older.</i>

01:28:56.618 --> 01:29:01.021
<i>So you look after your mother.
You take care of your father.
You take care of your mother.</i>

01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:05.016
It's real simple.
'Cause she's a good woman.

01:29:05.093 --> 01:29:06.526
It's not a fuckin' stretch.

01:29:06.595 --> 01:29:08.756
I know what you're saying.
Alright?

01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:10.855
Thanks for coming.
I should go.

01:29:11.767 --> 01:29:12.927
<i>Wow.</i>

01:29:15.904 --> 01:29:17.838
Monty's son.

01:29:19.908 --> 01:29:22.274
<i>You know what?
You're Flori's son as well.</i>

01:29:22.344 --> 01:29:24.209
<i>And that's why
you're all fucked up.</i>

01:29:24.279 --> 01:29:25.473
Yeah, I'm all fucked up.

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:29.311
You think you're going?
You're gonna fuckin' leave?
Go ahead, fuckin' go.

01:29:30.452 --> 01:29:31.851
You're not gonna go.

01:29:33.221 --> 01:29:36.554
You didn't fuckin' come
all the way over
so you could leave again.

01:29:36.625 --> 01:29:38.024
<i>You don't know.</i>

01:29:38.093 --> 01:29:41.153
You don't know
what it was like
in the house, okay?

01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:43.821
Listen.
You want it straight?

01:29:43.899 --> 01:29:47.335
'Cause I'm the only one
who's gonna tell you
for some fuckin' reason.

01:29:47.402 --> 01:29:51.031
You killed him.
You killed your father
when you left.

01:29:52.274 --> 01:29:54.469
Are you hearing me?
You fuckin' killed him.

01:29:54.543 --> 01:29:57.637
You left a trail of blood
when you left.

01:29:57.712 --> 01:30:01.239
So forget me.
Forget all this shit.
Forget it, alright?

01:30:01.316 --> 01:30:04.149
You killed your mother
and you killed your father.

01:30:04.219 --> 01:30:06.949
And for the past
fuckin' 20 years
he's been dying,

01:30:07.022 --> 01:30:09.456
just waiting for you
to come home.

01:30:09.524 --> 01:30:11.890
Say daddy, you're fucked up.
I hate your guts.

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:15.157
Whatever you need to get out
of your angsty little
fuckin' head.

01:30:15.230 --> 01:30:18.063
Touch my head
one more fuckin' time
and I'm gonna go nuts.

01:30:18.133 --> 01:30:20.158
Go ahead.
Go fuckin' nuts.

01:30:20.235 --> 01:30:23.796
Go fuckin' nuts.
Let it out!
Stop fuckin' running away.

01:30:23.872 --> 01:30:27.933
You think you're a man?
That's just a fuckin' tail
between your legs.

01:30:28.009 --> 01:30:30.170
Go home
and take care
of your mother.

01:30:30.245 --> 01:30:32.042
Go home
and take care
of your father.

01:30:32.114 --> 01:30:34.742
That's gonna make you
a fuckin' man.

01:30:34.816 --> 01:30:36.579
That's all you've got left.

01:30:36.651 --> 01:30:39.518
'Cause if you don't do
that shit, it's too fuckin' late.

01:30:39.588 --> 01:30:40.714
Okay, bye.

01:30:40.789 --> 01:30:42.154
Yeah.

01:30:47.596 --> 01:30:49.086
<i>You're going
to hospital.</i>

01:30:49.164 --> 01:30:50.597
Where's Ma?

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.627
Ma?
Where is she?

01:30:53.702 --> 01:30:55.135
<i>Why don't you get out?</i>

01:30:56.938 --> 01:30:58.064
Get out of the house.

01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:00.370
<i>Did you love me?
Ever?</i>

01:31:00.442 --> 01:31:01.568
<i>I said go.</i>

01:31:01.643 --> 01:31:03.907
Dad, did you love me
or not?

01:31:03.979 --> 01:31:05.412
Daddy, I gotta know.

01:31:06.414 --> 01:31:09.679
Lie to me and tell me you did.
Let me feel like
the piece of shit I am.

01:31:09.751 --> 01:31:11.480
Did you love me
or not?

01:31:13.255 --> 01:31:15.314
Answer me!

01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:16.448
<i>A father always--</i>

01:31:16.525 --> 01:31:18.652
Not a father!
You!

01:31:31.506 --> 01:31:33.371
Of course I did.

01:31:47.155 --> 01:31:50.090
I told you I loved you
the last time I saw you.

01:32:02.771 --> 01:32:05.865
<i>I love you, Dito.
Alright?</i>

01:32:05.941 --> 01:32:08.273
<i>You're my son.
I'm very proud of you.</i>

01:32:10.612 --> 01:32:11.943
<i>Now, Antonio,</i>

01:32:13.548 --> 01:32:16.517
<i>he doesn't have anybody
to tell him something
like this.</i>

01:32:20.021 --> 01:32:24.185
<i>Listen, Monday
you don't have
to go to school.</i>

01:32:25.594 --> 01:32:28.563
<i>Monday you take your ID.</i>

01:32:30.232 --> 01:32:31.824
<i>You go to Riker's.</i>

01:32:32.867 --> 01:32:34.562
<i>You see Antonio.</i>

01:32:36.304 --> 01:32:38.169
<i>Take your friend Mike with you.</i>

01:32:39.641 --> 01:32:41.336
<i>I like that kid.</i>

01:32:43.411 --> 01:32:45.845
<i>You take the bus there
with your friend.</i>

01:32:46.481 --> 01:32:47.880
<i>You go see Antonio.</i>

01:32:47.949 --> 01:32:49.382
Yeah, man.

01:32:52.387 --> 01:32:53.581
Have fun.

01:32:56.091 --> 01:32:57.888
<i>You're just kids, Dito.</i>

01:32:58.927 --> 01:33:00.918
<i>Just kids.</i>

01:33:02.664 --> 01:33:06.760
<i>But your friend Antonio,
he needs you now.</i>

01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:11.262
<i>'Cause he don't have anybody
to tell him what I just told you.</i>

01:33:34.929 --> 01:33:36.021
Come here.

01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:41.391
<i>Okay, enough.</i>

01:33:51.046 --> 01:33:53.071
Thank you for coming.

01:33:54.115 --> 01:33:56.208
I know I'm in the middle
of no place, right?

01:33:56.284 --> 01:34:00.186
No, no.
I-- I should've come,
you know, a long time go.

01:34:00.255 --> 01:34:02.086
<i>It's alright.</i>

01:34:10.165 --> 01:34:11.894
Damn, Dito.

01:34:15.337 --> 01:34:17.498
I got so much
I wanna say to you.

01:34:21.710 --> 01:34:23.735
I just don't know
what to say.

01:34:44.366 --> 01:34:46.891
<i>I don't know what I was
expecting to happen.</i>

01:34:50.372 --> 01:34:52.306
<i>Antonio exists.</i>

01:34:53.375 --> 01:34:54.842
<i>Crazy, huh?</i>

01:34:57.145 --> 01:35:00.046
<i>In the end,
just like I said,</i>

01:35:01.082 --> 01:35:03.880
<i>I left everything
and everyone,</i>

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:06.912
<i>but no one.</i>

01:35:07.689 --> 01:35:11.022
<i>No one
has ever left me.</i>

01:39:19.207 --> 01:39:21.232
Poor Antonio.

01:39:22.944 --> 01:39:24.707
He's in for life.

01:39:26.447 --> 01:39:29.143
<i>Maybe he'll get out.</i>

01:39:30.318 --> 01:39:33.310
Yeah, but he's got
a bad temper.

01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:37.953
With a bad temper
you can't be out of here.

01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:41.990
<i>He's a good guy, though.
He's a good guy, though.</i>

01:39:42.063 --> 01:39:43.826
Oh, yeah.
I like him.

01:39:46.934 --> 01:39:49.732
But good guys
don't get out of here.

01:39:52.607 --> 01:39:56.407
<i>They won't change.
Not to worry, you know.</i>
