WEBVTT

00:01.650 --> 00:02.890
We need to talk.

00:03.150 --> 00:04.490
Right now!

00:04.850 --> 00:08.890
We know Tracy is not in Africa.
He's hiding somewhere in New York.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.890
- What?
- Don't play stupid, Walter.

00:11.010 --> 00:13.890
We have ways of
making people talk.

00:14.050 --> 00:17.135
By giving them
fresh apple slices.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.004
Listen to me very carefully.

00:19.088 --> 00:21.122
This show is my life.

00:21.174 --> 00:23.008
I need Tracy back.

00:23.092 --> 00:24.793
Where is he?

00:24.861 --> 00:26.127
You think
we don't want him back?

00:26.179 --> 00:28.480
Do you know how much
our Cobra payments are?

00:28.564 --> 00:30.265
And he's the only one
that knows the combination

00:30.316 --> 00:31.933
to the candy safe.

00:31.984 --> 00:34.936
The worst part
is being able to see the candy.

00:35.987 --> 00:36.688
All right.

00:36.772 --> 00:38.690
But if I find out
you're holding out on me,

00:38.774 --> 00:39.974
I will no longer allow you

00:40.026 --> 00:41.660
to use my office
for your history club.

00:41.744 --> 00:44.812
That's ironic, because
next week's topic is fascism.

01:08.671 --> 01:10.004
What about grizz and dot com?

01:10.056 --> 01:11.172
They don't know anything.

01:11.224 --> 01:12.941
Neither does anyone
Tracy's close to...

01:13.008 --> 01:16.027
his wife, Charles Barkley,
Edward James Almost,

01:16.112 --> 01:18.029
who is an Edward James Olmos
lookalike

01:18.114 --> 01:20.615
- that Tracy is friends with.
- Kenneth talks to Tracy

01:20.683 --> 01:21.900
on Skype, doesn't he?
Just call him.

01:21.984 --> 01:23.235
It doesn't work that way.

01:23.319 --> 01:25.687
Tracy only contacts Kenneth
on special occasions

01:25.738 --> 01:26.905
like Bastille Day.

01:26.989 --> 01:28.323
I'm going to go ahead
and assume

01:28.374 --> 01:29.691
that Bastille is a stripper.

01:29.742 --> 01:31.526
As well you should.

01:31.577 --> 01:32.911
Now there's a chance
he may call tomorrow

01:32.995 --> 01:34.379
because it's
his lizard's birthday.

01:34.463 --> 01:38.166
Has it really been a year
since we were all at the Waldorf

01:38.217 --> 01:40.535
eating that cake made out
of lizard meal?

01:40.586 --> 01:41.720
Yup. Jeremy's almost 11.

01:41.804 --> 01:44.422
For now, our only lead
is the pizza box

01:44.507 --> 01:45.807
that we saw Tracy eating from.

01:45.874 --> 01:48.393
We traced the phone number
to a pizzeria in Queens.

01:48.477 --> 01:50.262
Listen to me.
I sound like Cagney and Lacey,

01:50.346 --> 01:51.763
but without the slutty clothes.

01:51.847 --> 01:52.981
You have to find him, Lemon.

01:53.048 --> 01:54.432
Your show works with Tracy.

01:54.517 --> 01:57.018
And this morning, I figured out
how to fix NBC.

01:57.069 --> 01:59.571
We will only do shows
that work.

01:59.655 --> 02:00.772
That's nonsense.

02:00.856 --> 02:01.740
Do you know
what the business model is

02:01.824 --> 02:03.224
in the entertainment industry?

02:03.276 --> 02:05.727
Make ten shows and hope
that one of them works.

02:05.778 --> 02:07.996
We produce more failed pilots

02:08.062 --> 02:09.864
than the French air force.

02:09.914 --> 02:14.035
$15 million so far
developing a show

02:14.086 --> 02:16.070
called <i>Who Nose?</i>
about an investigative reporter

02:16.122 --> 02:19.124
who can't smell and has to get
the story using only his eyes,

02:19.208 --> 02:20.458
ears, and other senses.

02:20.543 --> 02:22.460
You underestimated me,
congressman,

02:22.545 --> 02:23.712
because I can't smell.

02:23.763 --> 02:26.131
But you made one mistake.

02:26.215 --> 02:28.433
You let me see the documents.

02:28.517 --> 02:32.220
So from now on, no more
throwing good money after bad.

02:32.271 --> 02:36.424
Only what works. $10 million
developing <i>Dad 2.0?</i>

02:36.475 --> 02:38.727
Not on my watch.

02:38.778 --> 02:40.228
Your father may be gone,

02:40.279 --> 02:41.613
but before he died,

02:41.697 --> 02:43.698
he programmed me
to take his place.

02:43.766 --> 02:45.150
No. Shut it down.

02:45.234 --> 02:46.818
This is terrible.

02:46.902 --> 02:48.102
So what's going on?

02:48.154 --> 02:49.487
Is Tracy coming back
or what?

02:49.572 --> 02:50.955
Well, I don't know.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.157
Well, what do you know?

02:52.241 --> 02:53.458
What do you even do?

02:53.542 --> 02:54.793
I'm the producer
of the show.

02:54.877 --> 02:56.995
Right, that's what
your wife told me

02:57.079 --> 02:58.446
in the shower this morning.

02:59.832 --> 03:01.883
All right, well,
we're all having fun,

03:01.950 --> 03:03.918
and it's important that we all
be able to laugh together.

03:03.969 --> 03:05.053
Yeah, we're not laughing
with you.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.755
We're laughing at you,
you bald bitch.

03:08.758 --> 03:10.091
Yes, Reggie, I am bald.

03:10.142 --> 03:12.143
I lost my hair
at a very early age

03:12.228 --> 03:14.262
when I hit that Gypsy's kid
with my car,

03:14.313 --> 03:15.963
but I am still your boss.

03:16.015 --> 03:18.516
Hey, bald bitch.

03:20.569 --> 03:22.520
Hey, that's you.

03:22.605 --> 03:24.472
- No, I get it.
- He's being you.

03:24.523 --> 03:25.857
Yeah, I get it.
I get it.

03:25.941 --> 03:28.993
Listen up, fives.
A ten is speaking.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.612
As you may have heard,

03:30.663 --> 03:32.747
the Jennababy dolls
I've been selling on QVC

03:32.815 --> 03:33.865
have been recalled.

03:33.949 --> 03:35.483
Apparently
they were just being used

03:35.534 --> 03:37.652
to smuggle cocaine
into the country from Mexico.

03:37.703 --> 03:40.455
And that's caused some problems.

03:40.506 --> 03:42.457
Let's just go
to soccer practice now.

03:42.508 --> 03:43.708
I mean right now.

03:43.793 --> 03:45.927
Yes. It's 4:00 in the morning.
Let's do it.

03:45.994 --> 03:47.629
We own this town.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.348
Jennababies were my backup
if <i>TGS</i> gets cancelled,

03:50.433 --> 03:54.302
but don't worry because I have
a backup to my backup.

03:54.353 --> 03:55.520
We don't ever worry
about you.

03:55.604 --> 03:56.671
We don't think about you.

03:56.722 --> 03:58.440
That's right, Frank.

03:58.507 --> 03:59.524
I booked a movie.

03:59.608 --> 04:02.527
It's called
<i>Take my Hand.</i>

04:02.611 --> 04:06.147
It's kind of an artsy character
study about a young woman

04:06.198 --> 04:08.182
who has a lot of holes
drilled into her head

04:08.234 --> 04:11.152
by a deranged veterinarian
named Slaughterface.

04:11.203 --> 04:13.905
Oh, so you're doing
a torture porn thing like <i>Saw.</i>

04:13.989 --> 04:17.492
Exactly. In fact,
the producers of this movie

04:17.543 --> 04:19.661
rented <i>Saw</i>
and watched it.

04:19.712 --> 04:22.163
So let me know
if Tracy comes back.

04:22.214 --> 04:24.549
Until then, I will be
in Stamford, Connecticut.

04:24.633 --> 04:26.668
We're shooting there
for tax reasons.

04:26.719 --> 04:28.386
On an unrelated matter,

04:28.471 --> 04:31.756
does anyone know where I can get
intimate bleaching done

04:31.841 --> 04:32.757
in Stamford, Connecticut?

04:32.842 --> 04:34.392
Anyone?

04:36.095 --> 04:38.229
I'm leaving to do a movie,
Pete.

04:38.314 --> 04:40.098
What? No!
You can't do that.

04:40.182 --> 04:42.400
That's what your wife told me
in the shower this morning.

04:42.485 --> 04:44.853
Ha.

04:46.272 --> 04:47.739
Can we order lunch
from Ikea?

04:47.823 --> 04:49.223
What?
No.

04:49.275 --> 04:51.192
I'm the producer.
I'm picking lunch today.

04:51.243 --> 04:53.361
Okay.
We'll have a contest of strength

04:53.412 --> 04:55.697
to decide who gets
to pick lunch.

05:02.037 --> 05:03.588
Who's next?

05:04.757 --> 05:06.641
Welcome to Federici's.

05:06.709 --> 05:08.209
What can I get
for you guys?

05:08.260 --> 05:10.345
Well, as hard as it is
to believe,

05:10.412 --> 05:12.981
given our apparent ages,
this is my son.

05:13.048 --> 05:15.767
- Seems about right.
- Okay, good.

05:15.851 --> 05:19.270
My son is currently studying
at a local pizza academy.

05:19.355 --> 05:20.889
Really? Which one?

05:20.940 --> 05:23.608
New York Pizza Academy.

05:23.692 --> 05:24.926
Well, then I hate you,

05:24.977 --> 05:27.445
'cause I'm a Pizza Academy
of New York man.

05:28.898 --> 05:29.981
Wonderful.

05:30.065 --> 05:33.234
So what fraternity
are you pledging?

05:33.285 --> 05:34.953
I'm not.

05:35.037 --> 05:37.906
There are no fraternities
at New York Pizza Academy.

05:37.957 --> 05:40.325
That's right. You correctly
answered my trick question.

05:40.409 --> 05:43.277
Now I'm bound
by pizza academy tradition

05:43.329 --> 05:44.629
to grant you any request.

05:44.713 --> 05:46.831
Wow, this could not have gone
any better.

05:46.916 --> 05:48.049
We need to see
all your delivery receipts

05:48.116 --> 05:49.501
from the last two months.

05:49.585 --> 05:53.287
Oh, you got that delivery
receipt exam coming up, huh?

05:53.339 --> 05:54.923
What a bear.

05:54.974 --> 05:56.290
Here you go.

05:56.342 --> 05:58.259
Take your time.

05:58.310 --> 06:01.963
I'll be in the back trying to
think of other ways to help you.

06:02.014 --> 06:07.301
Well, this is obviously
a dead end.

06:10.356 --> 06:12.357
Yeah!

06:12.441 --> 06:15.142
Eat your weakness.

06:20.449 --> 06:22.149
Congratulations.

06:22.201 --> 06:23.651
According
to the transitive property,

06:23.702 --> 06:25.653
you just defeated Muammar
Qaddafi in arm wrestling.

06:26.705 --> 06:27.989
Yes!

06:28.040 --> 06:29.657
This would have bothered me
in my 20s.

06:29.708 --> 06:31.626
Pete, how are you so good
at that?

06:31.677 --> 06:33.661
I don't know.
I never work out.

06:33.712 --> 06:35.263
Paula!

06:35.330 --> 06:36.347
Here comes the big girl.

06:36.432 --> 06:37.715
She's got a clarinet.

06:38.851 --> 06:41.352
Pete, lunch is your pick.

06:41.437 --> 06:42.720
Takeout from Hooters.

06:42.805 --> 06:44.672
What?
That makes no sense.

06:44.723 --> 06:46.524
We'll know they touched it.

07:00.823 --> 07:03.575
No one's coming to save you.

07:03.659 --> 07:06.661
Oh, God.
Who are you?

07:06.712 --> 07:08.329
Cut!

07:08.380 --> 07:11.049
I just got a text
from the studio.

07:11.133 --> 07:12.584
We're shutting down production.

07:12.668 --> 07:14.636
- What?
- But I turned down <i>Carousel</i>

07:14.703 --> 07:16.671
- at the Goodspeed for this.
- I'm sorry, Dana,

07:16.722 --> 07:18.640
but our budget depends
on getting a tax break

07:18.707 --> 07:21.042
from Connecticut, and they say
we're not portraying the State

07:21.093 --> 07:22.143
in a positive light.

07:22.210 --> 07:24.062
How are we not doing that,
Shawn?

07:24.146 --> 07:26.714
I'm a little baffled
over here.

07:26.765 --> 07:28.850
Yeah, no, it's just that
we're spending taxpayer money

07:28.901 --> 07:30.985
saying there's a veterinarian
running around Connecticut

07:31.053 --> 07:31.986
trying to make
a house out of breasts

07:32.054 --> 07:33.271
for the Governor to live in.

07:33.355 --> 07:36.240
But there's a positive message
at the end of it.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.359
If you're a woman
in Connecticut,

07:38.410 --> 07:40.728
Slaughterface will kill you.

07:42.865 --> 07:44.532
This must be it.

07:44.583 --> 07:45.833
Yes, ma'am.

07:45.901 --> 07:47.085
There have been several
deliveries to this address

07:47.169 --> 07:49.337
of Mr. Jordan's
signature order...

07:49.404 --> 07:51.923
large cheese pizza
with one slice taken out

07:52.007 --> 07:53.741
so I can pretend
I'm eating pac-man

07:53.792 --> 07:55.259
like my hero
Blinky the ghost.

08:08.891 --> 08:11.559
I hear someone coming.

08:15.114 --> 08:18.265
Well, well, well.

08:18.317 --> 08:20.151
You found me.

08:20.235 --> 08:23.071
After I ordered Thai food
and gave you this address.

08:23.122 --> 08:24.989
Yeah?

08:25.074 --> 08:29.077
I'm sorry. I thought
my friend was living here.

08:29.128 --> 08:30.111
And my best friend.

08:30.162 --> 08:31.713
Oh, is this awkward?

08:31.780 --> 08:34.332
Because I'm your best friend,
but you're not my best friend?

08:34.416 --> 08:35.616
No.
No one living here.

08:35.668 --> 08:37.001
At least not since we moved in
two weeks ago.

08:37.086 --> 08:40.922
Wait a minute. Was that stuff
here when you moved in?

08:42.640 --> 08:44.842
A copy of <i>Black Yachts</i> magazine

08:44.927 --> 08:48.146
and a Rubik's cube that
has been smashed out of anger.

08:48.230 --> 08:50.014
Mr. Jordan was here.

08:50.099 --> 08:51.265
So what, Kenneth?

08:51.316 --> 08:52.934
These guys have been here
for two weeks.

08:52.985 --> 08:54.102
Tracy could be anywhere.

08:54.153 --> 08:55.603
We're never gonna find him,

08:55.654 --> 08:57.021
<i>TGS</i> is gonna get cancelled,
and then what?

08:57.106 --> 08:58.156
Can I work here?

08:58.240 --> 08:59.607
I'll do anything.

08:59.658 --> 09:01.526
I'll get in my bra,
and you could throw nails at me.

09:01.610 --> 09:02.527
I'll dance for you.

09:02.611 --> 09:03.661
Miss Lemon.

09:03.746 --> 09:05.329
Don't panic.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.532
We have other options.

09:07.616 --> 09:10.451
But for instance...
Mr. Jordan!

09:10.502 --> 09:12.870
Where are you?
Come back!

09:12.955 --> 09:17.759
For the love of God,
come back or we'll die!

09:18.155 --> 09:19.759
Jack, can we talk?

09:20.155 --> 09:21.009
One ten to another.

09:21.031 --> 09:22.665
I'm an 11, but continue.

09:22.749 --> 09:25.284
Me, my ass double,
and a drill that once appeared

09:25.335 --> 09:26.819
on <i>Home Improvement</i>
are currently starring

09:26.870 --> 09:28.621
in a feature film
called <i>Take my Hand.</i>

09:28.672 --> 09:30.823
Really? Years ago,
Universal had a project

09:30.874 --> 09:31.824
by that name.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.042
It was a romantic comedy

09:33.126 --> 09:35.378
with Reese Witherspoon
and Patrick Dempsey.

09:35.462 --> 09:38.163
Reese Witherspoon's
just a likeable version of me.

09:38.215 --> 09:41.017
Then she dropped out, and it
was rewritten as a buddy comedy

09:41.101 --> 09:42.885
with Dempsey and Josh Hartnett.

09:42.969 --> 09:44.970
But everyone fell asleep
during the table read,

09:45.038 --> 09:46.522
so we moved it over
to Telemundo

09:46.606 --> 09:48.858
where they tried to turn it
into a variety show

09:48.942 --> 09:52.478
hosted by a supermodel and
a soccer ball with a mustache.

09:52.546 --> 09:55.865
I met that soccer ball once
at a no-hands-allowed sex party.

09:55.949 --> 09:57.283
Then after another round
of rewrites,

09:57.350 --> 09:58.784
it was picked up
by our low-budget thriller,

09:58.852 --> 10:00.519
high-budget porno division,
Splatterflix,

10:00.570 --> 10:04.824
and now it's a horror movie
starring "any blonde actress."

10:04.875 --> 10:06.909
Thank you.

10:06.993 --> 10:09.328
Wait, that's our project?

10:09.379 --> 10:12.698
This is exactly what
I was talking to Lemon about.

10:12.749 --> 10:15.084
Three years,
millions on rewrites,

10:15.168 --> 10:20.005
$20,000 in first-class flights
for the drill.

10:20.057 --> 10:21.891
And we still have nothing
to show for it.

10:21.975 --> 10:23.175
And we never will.

10:23.226 --> 10:24.393
We just got shut down

10:24.478 --> 10:25.978
because Connecticut's
being a douche bag.

10:26.045 --> 10:27.313
They won't give us
a tax break

10:27.380 --> 10:28.881
unless the movie
promotes tourism.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.399
Then we make the movie
pro-Connecticut.

10:30.484 --> 10:34.570
We are not losing any more money
on <i>Take my Hand.</i>

10:34.654 --> 10:37.440
Okay, we just need to hire
some of those ugly people

10:37.524 --> 10:40.693
who have the paper
and change the shapes on it.

10:40.744 --> 10:42.611
Writers?
No.

10:42.696 --> 10:44.280
We'll do the work ourselves.

10:47.334 --> 10:48.617
Meet me in my dressing room.

10:48.702 --> 10:50.736
I'll get a computer
from one of the ugly people.

10:50.787 --> 10:53.706
And I'll bring the world's
greatest encyclopedia...

10:53.757 --> 10:56.742
my mind.

10:59.346 --> 11:01.079
Hey, is that a to-do list?

11:01.131 --> 11:02.765
'Cause if your wife's on there,
I've already taken care of her.

11:05.385 --> 11:07.636
I challenge you
to the wrestling of arms.

11:07.721 --> 11:09.472
- What?
- Arm wrestling.

11:09.556 --> 11:11.256
On the stage.
Midnight.

11:11.308 --> 11:13.392
In front of everyone.
How about tomorrow?

11:13.443 --> 11:15.111
Seems like it would be
more convenient for people.

11:15.195 --> 11:18.781
I'll meet you
anytime, anywhere.

11:18.865 --> 11:21.700
I just have to work
around a PTA meeting at 5:00

11:21.768 --> 11:25.154
that I can't miss, 'cause,
this week, I'm snack dad.

11:35.132 --> 11:36.549
Lemon, you look terrible.

11:36.616 --> 11:38.334
And I once watched you eat
oysters while you had a cold.

11:38.418 --> 11:40.085
We had him, Jack,
and we lost him.

11:40.137 --> 11:42.221
So Kenneth and I had to spend
the rest of the afternoon

11:42.288 --> 11:43.806
trying to think
like Tracy.

11:43.890 --> 11:46.425
I ended up eating a swordfish
dinner at a strip club,

11:46.476 --> 11:48.894
and Kenneth grabbed a cop's gun
and shot a blimp.

11:48.962 --> 11:51.013
Well, tomorrow's another day,
so go home,

11:51.097 --> 11:52.731
have a glass of wine,
and watch a show

11:52.799 --> 11:53.849
about wedding cake disasters.

11:53.934 --> 11:55.267
I can't go home, Jack.

11:55.318 --> 11:57.269
<i>TGS</i> goes away
if I don't find Tracy.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.156
I'm gonna wait up and hope
that he calls his lizard.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.473
Did you make sure
that Tracy wasn't pretending

12:01.525 --> 12:03.492
to be his own wax figure
at Madame Tussauds?

12:03.577 --> 12:04.944
Yes.
There was some confusion,

12:04.995 --> 12:07.980
and I ended up punching
the real Levar Burton.

12:08.031 --> 12:10.249
I'm gonna go get Jeremy.
I hope he's not still in heat.

12:10.316 --> 12:13.619
He has gotten
my top off before.

12:16.957 --> 12:18.541
Here you go.

12:18.625 --> 12:19.925
Did you know
that Connecticut is home

12:19.993 --> 12:23.161
to the oldest public library
in the United States?

12:23.213 --> 12:25.681
Huh. Could you use that
to motivate Slaughterface

12:25.765 --> 12:27.666
sewing the sheriff's mouth
to his own anus?

12:30.336 --> 12:32.221
Of course. Elegant.

12:32.305 --> 12:34.190
Should vaginatorium
be capitalized?

12:38.678 --> 12:40.479
Oh!

12:40.530 --> 12:42.180
I cannot wait to humiliate

12:42.232 --> 12:44.200
that guy in front of all
of his meathead buddies.

12:44.284 --> 12:45.951
You're like a new man, Pete.

12:46.019 --> 12:47.069
Yeah, I am.

12:47.153 --> 12:48.320
Last night,
I had sex with Paula,

12:48.371 --> 12:49.822
and neither of us
was wearing a walkman.

12:49.873 --> 12:51.023
Oh, yeah.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.025
Why are you
picking him up now?

12:53.076 --> 12:54.693
I'm supposed to have him
till the weekend.

12:54.744 --> 12:56.361
Shane wanted to come home,

12:56.413 --> 12:57.630
'cause his dad's a loser.

12:57.697 --> 12:59.698
Did your show
get cancelled yet?

12:59.749 --> 13:01.500
We don't know, Stephanie.
We're waiting for Tracy

13:01.551 --> 13:03.368
to Skype with Liz
and Jeremy the lizard.

13:03.420 --> 13:07.056
You're a joke. David is taking
us all to Outback Steakhouse,

13:07.140 --> 13:09.207
and we're getting appetizers,

13:09.259 --> 13:11.543
'cause David can afford them.

13:11.595 --> 13:14.563
Well, of course he can.
Mr. big shot pet photographer.

13:14.648 --> 13:16.181
I hope he can sleep at night.

13:16.233 --> 13:17.716
Never thought
I'd feel sorry for a guy

13:17.767 --> 13:20.552
with a tattoo of a leprechaun
vomiting on a book.

13:44.593 --> 13:46.912
No one's coming to save you.

13:46.963 --> 13:48.747
- Oh.
- Because we're deep

13:48.798 --> 13:53.052
inside one of Connecticut's
30 beautiful state forests.

13:53.603 --> 13:54.436
30!

13:54.521 --> 13:56.855
Oh, please,
don't kill me.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.642
I still haven't tried
the famous seafood pizza

13:59.726 --> 14:00.943
at Sally's in New Haven.

14:01.027 --> 14:02.778
And cut.

14:02.862 --> 14:05.430
Great. All right.
Let's move on to the scene

14:05.482 --> 14:07.566
where Slaughterface centipedes
Jenna to the docent

14:07.617 --> 14:09.034
of the Danbury Railway Museum.

14:09.102 --> 14:11.203
Hold on.
I just spoke to Walmart.

14:11.270 --> 14:13.789
They sponsor
wholesome TV programming,

14:13.873 --> 14:15.074
and I've convinced them

14:15.125 --> 14:16.325
to get into the movie business.

14:16.409 --> 14:18.410
They will partially fund
this project

14:18.461 --> 14:20.629
if we make it family-friendly.

14:20.714 --> 14:22.965
I can never find stuff
to watch with my kids.

14:23.049 --> 14:24.282
Thank you, Walmart.

14:24.334 --> 14:26.085
This production
will be profitable.

14:26.136 --> 14:29.805
Jenna, to your dressing room
to write.

14:29.889 --> 14:33.642
It begins with the words.

14:35.345 --> 14:37.313
Reggie.

14:37.397 --> 14:38.597
I need to show you something.

14:38.648 --> 14:40.316
Whoa.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.350
Is that your deltoid?

14:41.434 --> 14:43.986
I'm gonna beat you, Reggie.

14:44.070 --> 14:45.187
But I don't want to.

14:45.271 --> 14:46.772
I saw you in the lobby
with Stephanie

14:46.823 --> 14:50.142
and Shane talking
about David and appetizers.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.027
Look, I know what it's like
for your kids

14:52.112 --> 14:53.245
to think you're a loser.

14:53.312 --> 14:55.531
Which is why I'm gonna throw
the match.

14:55.615 --> 14:57.983
Wow.
You would do that for me?

15:00.920 --> 15:04.373
Know what your wife told me
in the shower this morning?

15:04.457 --> 15:05.708
You're a good guy.

15:12.632 --> 15:13.849
Oh, miss Lemon,

15:13.933 --> 15:15.667
wake up.
It's him.

15:15.719 --> 15:17.669
Okay, this is it,
Parcell.

15:17.721 --> 15:18.804
We got to keep Tracy
on the line,

15:18.855 --> 15:19.838
so draw him out.

15:19.889 --> 15:21.473
Don't spook him.
Act normal.

15:24.027 --> 15:25.561
Hello.
I'm a baby.

15:25.645 --> 15:27.112
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

15:27.180 --> 15:28.647
- You got in my head.
- Hang on.

15:28.698 --> 15:30.983
Something's not right.

15:31.034 --> 15:32.868
Why is Jeremy acting so weird?

15:32.952 --> 15:34.203
I don't like this.

15:34.287 --> 15:36.405
- Hey, Tracy, don't hang up.
- Uh-oh.

15:36.489 --> 15:38.991
Jeremy, call me
when you're alone.

15:41.961 --> 15:43.162
I'm sorry, miss Lemon.

15:43.213 --> 15:45.881
Don't be.
I know where he is.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.374
Merry Christmas!

15:50.425 --> 15:52.376
I practice abstinence.

15:52.427 --> 15:54.078
Connecticut!

15:54.129 --> 15:55.212
And cut.

15:57.516 --> 15:59.383
We're not done yet.
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:59.434 --> 16:00.635
this is Phil Rosenthal,

16:00.719 --> 16:02.937
the creator
of the acclaimed show

16:03.021 --> 16:03.938
<i>Everybody Loves Raymond.</i>

16:04.022 --> 16:05.056
Last great sitcom.

16:05.107 --> 16:07.141
Still does a 3.4 share
in Syndication.

16:07.225 --> 16:08.726
I did okay.

16:08.777 --> 16:10.311
I have a refrigerator
that's just for sodas.

16:10.395 --> 16:13.030
Anyway, Phil is interested
in getting into acting.

16:13.098 --> 16:14.815
- I got the bug.
- And has offered

16:14.900 --> 16:16.901
to pay us $5 million

16:16.952 --> 16:18.102
to be in the movie.

16:18.153 --> 16:19.453
I'll rewrite the part myself.

16:19.538 --> 16:21.271
You know what, why don't we
just get one as written,

16:21.323 --> 16:22.323
and then we'll play with it.

16:22.407 --> 16:24.625
You are a guest here, Phil.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.443
Hello, Phil.

16:26.495 --> 16:27.995
I never heard back
about my audition

16:28.080 --> 16:29.113
for <i>Everybody Loves Raymond.</i>

16:29.164 --> 16:30.464
I'd wondered
if you made a decision.

16:30.549 --> 16:32.466
Yeah, 15 years ago.

16:32.551 --> 16:33.834
We went with Doris Roberts.

16:33.919 --> 16:37.221
But thank you for tying
your headshot around a brick

16:37.288 --> 16:38.806
and throwing it
through my window.

16:41.677 --> 16:44.512
Go ahead, bald bitch.
Go ahead.

16:45.897 --> 16:46.897
Thanks for doing this.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.632
I convinced my ex

16:48.684 --> 16:51.135
to drop off my kid so
he could see me being a winner.

16:51.186 --> 16:53.354
You rock.

16:53.438 --> 16:55.189
No one's gonna know
that you did this

16:55.273 --> 16:57.141
or that you're actually stronger
than me.

16:57.192 --> 16:58.359
It doesn't matter.

16:58.443 --> 17:01.812
All that matters
is I'm doing the right thing.

17:01.863 --> 17:04.147
That's real strength.

17:25.353 --> 17:26.854
Ha.
I beat you.

17:26.938 --> 17:28.723
We're getting lunch
from Ikea.

17:28.807 --> 17:32.843
- Ikea!
- Ikea! Ikea!

17:32.894 --> 17:35.312
Ikea! Ikea!

17:39.484 --> 17:42.853
That's fine.
Don't offer your guest anything.

17:44.156 --> 17:45.239
Wax statue.

17:45.323 --> 17:47.541
Darn it.
I thought we had him.

17:47.626 --> 17:48.826
Are you kidding me?

17:48.877 --> 17:49.877
You have been hiding

17:49.961 --> 17:51.545
in my apartment
for the last two weeks?

17:51.630 --> 17:52.630
What are you mad about?

17:52.697 --> 17:54.498
I'm waiving the $60,000
you owe me

17:54.549 --> 17:55.833
in appearance fees.

17:55.884 --> 17:58.169
Did you really think
I wouldn't recognize

17:58.220 --> 18:01.005
my college futon with its
trademark absence of sex stains?

18:01.056 --> 18:03.224
This is the stupidest idea
you've ever had.

18:03.308 --> 18:04.708
Really?
Think about it.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.543
<i>TGS</i> is your whole life.

18:06.595 --> 18:08.378
So where's the last place
you would be

18:08.430 --> 18:10.347
if you were out
trying to save your show?

18:10.398 --> 18:13.050
Home. Life lesson
from an unlikely source.

18:13.101 --> 18:14.935
The only thing I do here
is sleep.

18:15.020 --> 18:17.188
I know.
I seen you do it.

18:17.239 --> 18:18.656
You're having a dream.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.658
Is this your only mustard?

18:20.725 --> 18:22.526
Huh? What?
Yeah.

18:22.577 --> 18:24.612
You're the one who wrote

18:24.696 --> 18:26.914
"every kind of mustard"
on my shopping list.

18:26.998 --> 18:29.366
And yet you still don't have
the one I'm thinking of.

18:29.417 --> 18:32.419
It's red.
It says ketchup on it.

18:32.504 --> 18:34.121
Oh, I hear it.
That's on me.

18:34.206 --> 18:36.540
Look, Tracy.

18:36.591 --> 18:37.875
I don't know
why you're going crazy,

18:37.926 --> 18:38.876
but I want to help.

18:38.927 --> 18:40.261
Just come back to <i>TGS.</i>

18:40.345 --> 18:41.929
You don't think I want to,
L.L.?

18:42.013 --> 18:43.798
Then why are you hiding?

18:43.882 --> 18:46.467
Oh, no, did you
also spill ice cream

18:46.551 --> 18:48.269
on your mom's boyfriend's
record player?

18:48.353 --> 18:51.889
As a time saver, I will refer
to the two of you as Klemon.

18:51.940 --> 18:54.424
I wanted that next level,
Klemon.

18:54.476 --> 18:56.227
Now, remember,
to save time,

18:56.278 --> 18:57.444
you two are Klemon.

18:57.529 --> 18:59.563
- It's a combination of...
- Just keep going.

18:59.614 --> 19:01.431
I had everything I dreamed of.

19:01.483 --> 19:05.236
Awards, respect,
Justin Long's autograph.

19:05.287 --> 19:07.771
But I also got expectations.

19:07.823 --> 19:09.790
People thought
I could change the world.

19:09.875 --> 19:11.876
And it's too much pressure.

19:11.943 --> 19:15.212
Like the time I got stuck in
Temple Grandin's hugging machine

19:15.280 --> 19:16.446
at the Golden Globes party.

19:16.498 --> 19:19.166
You pretended
to be in Africa

19:19.251 --> 19:21.118
so that no one
would be disappointed in you.

19:21.169 --> 19:23.137
I'm sorry I did this to you,
half of Klemon.

19:23.221 --> 19:24.672
I had no choice.

19:24.756 --> 19:27.124
Sean Penn wanted me to go
to Haiti with him.

19:27.175 --> 19:28.342
And I'm not strong enough

19:28.426 --> 19:30.294
for the pain
and the human misery

19:30.345 --> 19:31.729
of a three-hour plane ride

19:31.796 --> 19:33.814
with Sean Penn.

19:33.899 --> 19:35.132
I'm tired of hiding.

19:35.183 --> 19:37.818
I just want my old life back.

19:37.903 --> 19:39.854
Then you need to get people
to stop respecting you

19:39.938 --> 19:41.689
and start remembering
what an idiot you are.

19:41.773 --> 19:43.657
You're off the leash,
Tracy.

19:43.742 --> 19:46.861
It's not a leash.
It's a very long skin tag.

19:46.945 --> 19:48.362
You want your old life back?

19:48.446 --> 19:50.664
You're Tracy Jordan.

19:50.749 --> 19:53.650
Hulk Hogan called you
a dirt bag.

19:53.702 --> 19:56.370
The NAACP once hired someone
to kill you.

19:56.454 --> 19:59.540
You wore a penis hat
to princess Diana's funeral.

19:59.624 --> 20:02.009
Because I had worn it
to their wedding.

20:02.093 --> 20:03.994
It was special
to the three of us.

20:04.045 --> 20:07.331
You were the worst,
and you can be again.

20:07.382 --> 20:08.883
You just have to go out there

20:08.967 --> 20:11.385
and remind people
who you really are.

20:11.469 --> 20:15.172
Go trash a hotel room,
expose yourself to Elmo,

20:15.223 --> 20:16.724
visit OJ in jail again,

20:16.808 --> 20:19.343
attack the Lincoln Memorial
with a hammer.

20:20.394 --> 20:22.846
I have to burn
all my goodwill.

20:22.898 --> 20:24.531
Then they won't expect anything
from me.

20:24.616 --> 20:26.317
And you can go back
to your old life

20:26.368 --> 20:28.035
and <i>TGS.</i>

20:28.119 --> 20:31.038
Tracy Jordan
is off the leash!

20:37.462 --> 20:39.880
Godspeed, Mr. Jordan.

20:44.164 --> 20:45.515
♪ I'm the hero cop ♪

20:45.599 --> 20:46.799
♪ and I'm here to say ♪

20:46.850 --> 20:47.934

20:48.001 --> 20:49.936
♪ is what I'm here to say ♪

20:50.003 --> 20:51.854
I can't believe
that amazing rap is available

20:51.939 --> 20:53.272
now on iTunes.

20:53.340 --> 20:54.340
Are you kidding?

20:55.040 --> 20:56.040
No one's gonna pay to see that.

20:56.740 --> 20:59.200
It doesn't matter, It's already
profitable. It works, Lemon.

20:59.340 --> 21:03.000
<i>To vote for Phil Rosenthal
text "Phil" to 62288,</i>

21:03.440 --> 21:05.300
Vote? For what? Isn't this
supposed to be a movie?

21:05.440 --> 21:09.000
Again, it doesn´t matter. People will
just to anything to get 99 cents of text.

21:09.140 --> 21:12.000
Well, I'm not letting Rosenthal win
I am voting for the muppet.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.000
<i>To vote for Liz Lemon
