00:02.335 --> 00:05.504
Debra, please sit.
- Okay.

00:05.506 --> 00:10.275
- Debra, why is it that you want
to marry raymond?

00:10.277 --> 00:16.515
- Oh, um, well, uh, you know,
ray is just the--

00:16.517 --> 00:20.452
He's the kindest, sweetest man
I've ever met, you know?

00:20.454 --> 00:23.555
And he has
a wonderful sense of humor.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.625
I mean,
he's not always funny,

00:26.627 --> 00:30.162
But, um, he really is
very clever.

00:30.164 --> 00:33.399
And nobody makes me laugh
like he does.

00:37.037 --> 00:41.340
- Really?

00:41.342 --> 00:44.176
- Yes, and, um,
I don't know.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.745
I guess I've never been
as comfortable with anybody

00:46.747 --> 00:47.745
In my whole life.

00:47.747 --> 00:50.549
In fact, you know, just about
the minute I met him,

00:50.551 --> 00:52.785
I knew that he was the one
for me,

00:52.787 --> 00:55.154
So that's it.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.589
[sighs]

00:57.591 --> 00:59.391
- Don't lie.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.701
- I'm not lying.

01:09.703 --> 01:10.636
- Are you lying, debra?

01:10.638 --> 01:14.440
- No!

01:14.442 --> 01:15.507
- Well, then that was lovely.

01:22.315 --> 01:28.587
Raymond, why is it that you wish
to marry debra?

01:28.589 --> 01:32.558
- Um, you said "wish."

01:32.560 --> 01:33.558
- Excuse me?

01:33.560 --> 01:37.096
- Yeah, yeah,
for me, you said,

01:37.098 --> 01:40.099
"why would you wish
to marry her?"

01:40.101 --> 01:41.533
And for her, you said,

01:41.535 --> 01:46.472
"why would you want
to marry him?"

01:46.474 --> 01:49.775
Yeah, yeah,
there's a subtle thing there.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.643
Yeah.

01:51.645 --> 01:52.643
- He didn't say,

01:52.645 --> 01:54.580
"why would you want
to marry him?"

01:54.582 --> 01:57.349
- I wouldn't say "would."

01:57.351 --> 02:00.152
- Okay, but still, "wish" was
to me, you know,

02:00.154 --> 02:03.789
Like--like, "yeah, you wish."

02:03.791 --> 02:05.357
- What are you doing?

02:05.359 --> 02:06.357
- Yeah.
Yeah.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.827
- Tell him why you want
to marry me!

02:08.829 --> 02:10.729
- Okay.

02:20.306 --> 02:23.775
She's great, all right?

02:23.777 --> 02:26.612
- Great.

02:26.614 --> 02:27.846
I'm going to assume

02:27.848 --> 02:32.317
That you won't be writing
your own vows.

02:32.319 --> 02:36.622
Um, well,
let me ask you this.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.756
Are children planned?

02:37.758 --> 02:38.891
- Oh, yes.
Yes.

02:38.893 --> 02:42.561
We plan on having a big family.

02:42.563 --> 02:46.231
- Raymond?

02:46.233 --> 02:48.800
- Well, I never really
thought about it.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.536
- We talked about it.

02:50.538 --> 02:54.239
- That doesn't mean
I thought about it.

02:54.241 --> 02:57.342
- Actually, uh--

02:57.344 --> 02:59.244
Actually, I am a little pressed
for time today,

02:59.246 --> 03:01.747
But raymond, if I may,

03:01.749 --> 03:03.315
Marriage requires

03:03.317 --> 03:04.917
A great deal
of soul searching

03:04.919 --> 03:07.719
Before a responsible decision
can be made.

03:07.721 --> 03:11.523
Now, you owe that to yourself
and to your intended.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.726
Her.

03:14.728 --> 03:18.530
Now, you can stay and talk
for as long as you want

03:18.532 --> 03:20.966
Or wish.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.501
But I think I--

03:22.503 --> 03:25.571
Oh, good, a funeral.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.539
God bless.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.750
- [sighs]

03:38.752 --> 03:40.719
So want to get
something to eat?

03:40.721 --> 03:42.688
- What did you do?

03:42.690 --> 03:44.423
- What?
What?

03:44.425 --> 03:46.992
- "what"?
He thinks you're a moron.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.594
- Well, you're marrying me.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.828
- Yeah, I know!

03:49.830 --> 03:50.862
- You see?
There it is.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.998
- There what is, ray?

03:53.000 --> 03:56.401
- That you don't really want me.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.437
You want the flowers
and the dresses

03:58.439 --> 04:02.507
And the lamb chops
with the little paper panties.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.919
- You are so full of it.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.455
"oh, she's just using me

04:16.457 --> 04:18.257
So she can have
her big wedding."

04:18.259 --> 04:20.025
You think I'm falling
for that act?

04:20.027 --> 04:21.627
Tell the truth!

04:21.629 --> 04:23.862
You're scared.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.964
You're scared of having
to move out of your mom's house

04:25.966 --> 04:27.399
And start an actual life.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.967
Well, let me
tell you something.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.535
I meant what I said here today.

04:30.537 --> 04:34.873
I love you!

04:34.875 --> 04:37.276
And you love me,
and we are getting married.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.879
You want to act?
Act like you're happy!

04:40.881 --> 04:42.014
You understand me?

04:42.016 --> 04:43.582
Oh, my god.
You know what?

04:43.584 --> 04:44.783
I don't care
if you're scared.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.018
I don't care
if you're nervous.

04:46.020 --> 04:49.521
You got cold feet?
You get some socks!

04:59.565 --> 05:02.634
- She really wants
that wedding.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.744
- Hey, raymond.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.046
- Hey, uncle mel.
How are you?

05:14.048 --> 05:16.415
- I'm good.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.318
You look like a bus toilet.

05:23.389 --> 05:27.659
- Thanks.
Glad you could come.

05:27.661 --> 05:32.331
- This is lewis.
He's my business partner.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.099
- Hey.
How are you?

05:34.101 --> 05:36.702
- We're not gay.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.714
- Okay, then.
Okay.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.349
See you in a bit, right?

06:00.927 --> 06:02.627
[knocking at door]

06:02.629 --> 06:04.529
- I saw you come in here.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.064
- Look, ma, please,
not now, okay?

06:06.066 --> 06:10.902
- Oh, honey, I understand
what you're going through.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.538
You don't think I know?
Oh.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.007
She's very pretty,
isn't she?

06:16.009 --> 06:17.976
- Who, debra?

06:17.978 --> 06:21.480
- It's hard sometimes
with pretty people, you know?

06:21.482 --> 06:24.549
You feel so--you know?

06:24.551 --> 06:28.387
Listen, our family
is not the most--

06:28.389 --> 06:29.955
You know?

06:29.957 --> 06:34.760
Look at your father.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.562
It's not that
I didn't have choices.

06:37.564 --> 06:41.833
But I picked him.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.035
And now--

06:44.037 --> 06:46.805
Oh, raymond, I'm sorry.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.608
[sobbing]

06:50.977 --> 06:54.446
- My god!

06:54.448 --> 06:56.982
- Hey, big crowd.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.851
Hey, listen, debra's father,
what's his name?

06:59.853 --> 07:01.052
- Warren.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.455
- Don't like him.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.858
But the good news is,
you don't marry the parents.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.059
You'll see;
after you're married,

07:08.061 --> 07:11.897
The parents aren't
in your life so much.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.099
- The way your mother
wasn't in my life?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.934
- Aw.
- Don't start with my mother.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.135
- A horrible woman!

07:17.137 --> 07:19.538
- A saint.
She tried to warn me about you.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.839
- Oh, fine.
Move.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.809
You had to ruin
the happiest day of our lives.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.577
And don't sit
next to me in there.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.980
- There's no room
next to you!

07:28.982 --> 07:32.017
So you're getting married, huh?
That's great.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.719
- Yeah.
Yeah.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.521
You know what?
I think I want to see debra.

07:36.523 --> 07:37.989
- No, no, no, no, no.
No, that's forbidden.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.858
Even I know that.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.928
Listen, if I'd seen
your mother before the thing,

07:42.930 --> 07:45.230
I'd be having this conversation
on a beach in jamaica

07:45.232 --> 07:47.732
With my son ruiz.

07:50.036 --> 07:52.237
Here, I got
a better idea for you.

07:52.239 --> 07:55.674
- Jack daniel's?
No, dad.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.808
- Listen to your father,
will you?

07:56.810 --> 07:57.876
Relax!

07:57.878 --> 08:00.045
You're getting all womanly!

08:00.047 --> 08:02.481
Come on.
Have a belt or two.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.649
Take the edge off!
Come on!

08:04.651 --> 08:05.917
- Please, dad.
- Listen to me!

08:05.919 --> 08:07.586
- Hey, ray.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.488
Listen, can I run
my toast by you?

08:09.490 --> 08:10.922
- Not now, robert,
please, okay?

08:10.924 --> 08:12.057
Just not now.

08:12.059 --> 08:15.494
- Sure.
Fine.

08:15.496 --> 08:18.964
It's all about you.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.900
- Well, I'll see you
down front, ray.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.935
And crack the seal
on this hooch.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.570
It got me through.

08:28.941 --> 08:30.575
- Hey, you okay?

08:30.577 --> 08:31.910
- Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.
I'm just--

08:31.912 --> 08:32.910
- You know, I got to tell you,

08:32.912 --> 08:35.580
This whole marriage thing
just spooks me.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.549
I see a lot of bad things.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.084
- What, being a cop and all?

08:39.086 --> 08:43.288
- Mom and dad.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.524
- There's the groom.

08:45.526 --> 08:46.758
- Oh.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.995
- The bride asked us
to deliver this.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.564
- Did she leave?

08:52.566 --> 08:54.599
- No, silly.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.639
- Socks?

09:05.945 --> 09:08.680
- [chuckles]
yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.649
- Ten minutes, people.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.788
- Well, here we go.

09:16.790 --> 09:17.956
- Righto!

09:19.859 --> 09:22.761
- So, debra, huh?

09:22.763 --> 09:25.130
- Yeah, yeah, debra, yeah.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.197
- Debra's some girl.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.667
- Yeah, I know.
I know. I know.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.768
Yeah, I know.
- See you out there.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.336
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.271
All right.

10:16.616 --> 10:22.621
[soft classical music]

10:29.161 --> 10:31.663
- Where's ray?

10:47.279 --> 10:50.215
- Hey, hi.
Nice to see you.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.229
Oh, boy.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.968
Look at her.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.871
Are you looking, man?
Look. Are you looking?

11:21.981 --> 11:22.981
Hi.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.250
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

11:28.387 --> 11:30.855
Hi.
Hi.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.327
Thanks.
Thank you.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.430
Thanks for this, really.

11:38.432 --> 11:41.966
Great job.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.068
Go, go, go, you know?
Go sit down.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.169
I got her.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.437
I'll take her the rest
of the way.

11:52.978 --> 11:53.977
- [chuckles]

11:53.979 --> 11:56.147
- Oh, look at you.
You look fantastic.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.783
- Thanks.

11:58.785 --> 11:59.784
- Hello?

11:59.786 --> 12:02.120
- Hi.
[chuckles]

12:02.122 --> 12:03.254
- Open it up.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.422
- Okay, I'll do it.
I'll do it.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.457
I'll take care of it.
I can do it.

12:05.459 --> 12:10.295
That's okay.
Hi.

12:10.297 --> 12:14.132
Give me the flowers.

12:14.134 --> 12:18.169
- I like that dress.
I do. I like the dress.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.138
- Are you okay?

12:20.140 --> 12:21.873
- Who wouldn't be okay?

12:21.875 --> 12:23.942
Look at you.
You're beautiful.

12:23.944 --> 12:29.247
- You're not freaking out,
are you?

12:29.249 --> 12:32.217
- I'm in love with you.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.235
- Dearly beloved--

12:50.237 --> 12:51.936
- Hi.

13:00.146 --> 13:03.281
- Hi.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.351
- Look at her, huh?
Look at her.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.019
- She is beautiful.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.021
- Hey, she's engaged.
[chuckles]

13:19.398 --> 13:22.433
- "you have come here together
in the sight of god

13:22.435 --> 13:26.070
"so that the lord may seal
and strengthen your love

13:26.072 --> 13:29.574
In the presence of this church
and its community."

13:29.576 --> 13:33.344
- [makes loud kissing noise]

13:33.346 --> 13:37.549
- I now ask the bride and groom
to state their intentions.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.284
Raymond and debra...

13:39.286 --> 13:43.321
- [laughs]

13:43.323 --> 13:45.323
- "have you come here freely
and without reservation

13:45.325 --> 13:48.393
To give yourselves
to each other in marriage?"

13:48.395 --> 13:49.561
- Yes.

13:49.563 --> 13:54.165
- Thanks.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.601
Me too.
Yeah.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.236
- "will you love and honor
each other

13:58.238 --> 14:01.139
As husband and wife
for the rest of your lives?"

14:01.141 --> 14:03.007
- Yes, yes, yes!

14:03.009 --> 14:04.843
[both chuckling]

14:04.845 --> 14:07.378
- Uh, yes.
Stop it.

14:07.380 --> 14:12.283
- What's the matter
with raymond?

14:12.285 --> 14:16.487
- I feel compelled
to say something.

14:16.489 --> 14:20.024
When I first met raymond,
I was less than overwhelmed

14:20.026 --> 14:22.994
By his demeanor towards
the prospect of matrimony.

14:22.996 --> 14:28.333
But now he seems to be
the very personification

14:28.335 --> 14:31.135
Of the wedding spirit.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.503
There is, after all,

14:32.505 --> 14:36.507
No more joyous occasion
than this.

14:36.509 --> 14:41.346
And perhaps our raymond
is behaving today

14:41.348 --> 14:44.349
The way god always intended.

14:50.189 --> 14:54.025
- So that's good, right?

14:54.027 --> 14:57.362
- It is both refreshing
and wonderful.

14:57.364 --> 15:00.965
- Aw.

15:00.967 --> 15:06.170
Are we married yet?

15:06.172 --> 15:08.473
- "do you, raymond,
take debra"...

15:08.475 --> 15:12.243
- Yes.
- Wait.

15:12.245 --> 15:16.414
"to be your wife?"
wait.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.649
"do you promise
to be true to her

15:17.651 --> 15:18.616
In good times and bad?"

15:18.618 --> 15:21.352
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

15:21.354 --> 15:25.957
"to love her and honor her
all the days of your life?"

15:27.259 --> 15:30.495
Now.
- Yes.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.464
Debra?
- I do.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.000
- Thanks.

15:36.002 --> 15:39.203
Hey, is it too late
for that own vows thing?

15:39.205 --> 15:40.271
- You want to say something?

15:40.273 --> 15:44.676
- Yeah, yeah,
I need the ring.

15:44.678 --> 15:48.246
Thanks!
You're little.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.689
I'm sorry I've been
such a jerk.

15:57.691 --> 16:02.627
And I promise
not to be one anymore...

16:05.731 --> 16:10.435
If you'll help me.

16:10.437 --> 16:14.238
- I will.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.442
- You have declared your consent
before the church.

16:17.444 --> 16:21.412
What god has joined,
men cannot divide.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.581
- Let 'em try.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.121
- Oh, I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

16:30.123 --> 16:33.124
[cheers and applause]

16:43.669 --> 16:44.769
- I love you.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.772
- Yeah, you say that now.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.674
- Hey, raymond,
feeling better?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.476
- Yeah, I'm pretty good.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.778
- That was some show
you put on in there today.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.681
[both laugh]
- I thought he was cute.

16:56.683 --> 17:00.585
- Cute?
There's a new word for it.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.021
Well, uh, if you'll
excuse me now,

17:03.023 --> 17:05.123
I'll be at the bar
getting "cute."

17:05.125 --> 17:06.591
- Okay.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.227
Okay, dad.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.129
- What's he talking about, ray?

17:11.131 --> 17:15.199
- Nothing. Nothing.
He talks. He talks.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.568
- Ray, please don't tell me--

17:17.570 --> 17:18.703
- What?
What?

17:18.705 --> 17:20.505
- Were you--
- no.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.640
- Were you--
- no, no, no, listen.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.209
- Oh, my god.
Are you drunk now?

17:25.211 --> 17:27.078
- No, deb--
- oh, my god!

17:27.080 --> 17:28.079
- No!
Debra, no!

17:28.081 --> 17:29.680
No!

17:29.682 --> 17:32.083
- Oh, my--you know, I knew
you were too happy out there.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.084
- I was not.
- What did I do?

17:33.086 --> 17:34.485
How could you do this to me?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.154
Is that what it takes
to marry me?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.688
- No, will you stop?
Look, here, look.

17:37.690 --> 17:38.823
- Oh, my god!

17:38.825 --> 17:40.658
- No, just look at it.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.060
- Why?
Why?

17:42.062 --> 17:43.060
You want me to be drunk too,

17:43.062 --> 17:45.296
So we can be like two
drunken married idiots together?

17:45.298 --> 17:47.298
- Will you stop it?
Look at it! Look!

17:47.300 --> 17:50.601
I didn't crack the seal.
It's full.

17:50.603 --> 17:54.372
He gave it to me,
but I never opened it.

17:54.374 --> 17:59.177
- So that was you out there?

18:05.717 --> 18:11.656
- I got the socks,
and I started thinking

18:11.658 --> 18:15.693
That was funny,
that you would send me socks.

18:15.695 --> 18:19.097
And then I thought,

18:19.099 --> 18:19.797
"she's kind of funny."

18:19.799 --> 18:21.732
- [chuckles]

18:21.734 --> 18:24.202
- You know, and then I started
thinking about where I was

18:24.204 --> 18:27.672
And you

18:27.674 --> 18:30.575
And us.

18:30.577 --> 18:34.278
And then I didn't need
the socks.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.381
- So that was you happy.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.217
- Yeah.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.786
Don't get used to that.
- Okay.

18:41.788 --> 18:45.556
[glasses chiming]

18:45.558 --> 18:47.458
- [clears throat loudly]

18:47.460 --> 18:49.527
Hello.

18:49.529 --> 18:54.332
I, um, got to make a toast.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.869
I'd like to say
to my brother, raymond,

18:57.871 --> 18:59.403
That even though
there have been times

18:59.405 --> 19:03.708
I felt that he was
the favorite,

19:03.710 --> 19:07.778
That he always got everything
he ever wanted,

19:07.780 --> 19:11.749
I have never felt that more
than I do today.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.552
[all laugh]

19:17.789 --> 19:21.759
I want to wish
these two kids well.

19:21.761 --> 19:28.699
I know success will probably
move them far, far away from us.

19:28.701 --> 19:32.637
But I know somehow
we'll find a way to be together.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.473
- Of course we will.
[sobbing]

19:35.475 --> 19:37.808
- So if everyone
will join me

19:37.810 --> 19:41.746
To mr. And mrs. Raymond barone.

19:49.621 --> 19:50.620
- Have I mentioned

19:50.622 --> 19:53.591
There are some weird things
about my family?

20:09.208 --> 20:14.812
[slow accordion music]

20:25.290 --> 20:28.459
- How could you ever doubt
that I wanted to marry you?

20:28.461 --> 20:29.427
- I'm still not convinced.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.329
- [laughs]

20:31.331 --> 20:33.864
What's it gonna take?
