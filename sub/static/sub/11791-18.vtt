WAY HE IS, FOR WHATS INSIDE.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.311
WHATS BETWEEN US IS AGELESS,

04:17.320 --> 04:18.412
BUT THE WORLD DOESNT SEE IT

04:18.420 --> 04:19.853
THAT WAY.

04:19.860 --> 04:20.724
>> WE CAN NEVER MAKE PEOPLE

04:20.730 --> 04:23.324

WITH HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENT

04:25.430 --> 04:27.523
WE MET.

AND THIS SWEET 8-YEAR-OLD BOY

04:32.340 --> 04:33.898
WALKED INTO MY HOMEROOM AND

04:33.900 --> 04:34.867
ENTERED MY HEART.

04:34.870 --> 04:35.768
>> YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH AN

04:35.770 --> 04:36.691
8-YEAR-OLD?

04:36.700 --> 04:40.704
>> NO, OF COURSE NOT. WE JUST...

04:40.710 --> 04:43.747
WE HAD A RAPPORT. BUT THEN

04:43.750 --> 04:44.739
LATER, WHEN I WAS TEACHING

04:44.750 --> 04:45.842
SEVENTH GRADE AND RICKY SHOWED

04:45.850 --> 04:47.545
UP IN MY CLASS AGAIN--

04:47.550 --> 04:48.539
>> I WAS--I WAS 13.

04:48.550 --> 04:49.619
>> BUT HE WAS VERY MATURE FOR

04:49.620 --> 04:51.884

04:51.890 --> 04:53.551
UNDERSTAND ME IN A WAY THAT NO

04:53.560 --> 04:55.755

04:55.760 --> 04:57.489
SOULMATES, DOCTOR?

04:57.490 --> 04:58.752
>> I BELIEVE THAT LITTLE BOYS

04:58.760 --> 05:00.591
HAVE CRUSHES ON THEIR TEACHERS

05:00.600 --> 05:01.692
AND THAT THOSE TEACHERS ARE

05:01.700 --> 05:02.860
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BOUNDARIES.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.326
>> BUT THATS THE THING ABOUT

05:04.330 --> 05:05.866
FALLING IN LOVE. THERE ARE NO

05:05.870 --> 05:08.293
BOUNDARIES. MY LIFE WAS

05:08.300 --> 05:10.632
TRANSFORMED. YOU THINK I WOULD

05:10.640 --> 05:11.834
HAVE PICKED RICKY IF I HAD A

05:11.840 --> 05:13.307
CHOICE?

05:13.310 --> 05:14.470
IT WAS AS IF I FINALLY FOUND

05:14.480 --> 05:15.731
HAPPINESS, AND I WAS NOT

05:15.740 --> 05:18.834
GOING TO LET THAT GO...

05:18.910 --> 05:20.514
EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING

05:20.520 --> 05:22.818
CONSPIRED AGAINST US.

05:22.820 --> 05:25.038
[IN DISTINCT CHATTER]

05:31.860 --> 05:33.657
I PLED GUILTY TO TWO COUNTS OF

05:33.660 --> 05:35.389
STATUTORY RAPE. I WAS LET GO

05:35.400 --> 05:36.526
AFTER 6 MONTHS FOR GOOD

05:36.530 --> 05:37.656
BEHAVIOR ON THE CONDITION THAT I

05:37.660 --> 05:41.107

05:41.110 --> 05:44.932
>> I--I COULDNT STAY AWAY.

OH, JUST LIKE THAT. JUST LIKE

05:54.350 --> 05:55.112
THAT.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.610
BUT...I WAS A CONVICTED SEX

05:56.620 --> 05:57.814
OFFENDER. SO THEY WERE

05:57.820 --> 05:59.424
MONITORING MY WHEREABOUTS.

05:59.430 --> 06:02.820
OH, YES, SWEETIE. GOD. OH. OHH.

06:08.390 --> 06:09.436
I WENT BACK TO PRISON FOR THE

06:09.440 --> 06:11.692
FULL TERM.

06:11.700 --> 06:12.894
>> THE MINUTE I TURNED 18, I

06:12.900 --> 06:14.663
APPLIED TO THE COURT TO LIFT THE

06:14.670 --> 06:16.865
NO-CONTACT ORDER. THE REQUEST

06:16.870 --> 06:19.577
WAS GRANTED, AND, UH, WE GOT

06:19.580 --> 06:23.698
MARRIED A WEEK LATER.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.905
WELL, WERE FREE NOW. WHO GIVES

> > SORRY.

06:30.120 --> 06:34.580
>> ONCE A TEACHER...

06:34.590 --> 06:35.909
>> IF YOU DONT CARE WHAT THEY

06:35.920 --> 06:36.887
SAY, WHY DO YOU CARE WHAT YOU

06:36.890 --> 06:38.482
LOOK LIKE?

06:38.490 --> 06:39.422
>> BECAUSE IM GONNA BE A

06:47.570 --> 06:49.435
DISRESPECTFUL TO CARRIE MAY AND

06:49.440 --> 06:50.429
THE FAMILY WERE TRYING TO

06:50.440 --> 06:51.429
BUILD.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.600
>> OUR LOVE HAS BEEN LEGITIMIZED

06:52.610 --> 06:54.703
IN THE EYES OF THE LAW, BUT WE

06:54.710 --> 06:57.577
CANT TRANSFORM SOCIETY. SO

06:57.580 --> 06:59.639
WELL DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO

06:59.650 --> 07:02.619
THAT PEOPLE LEAVE US IN PEACE.

HOW LONG UNTIL YOURE GONNA BE

29:58.420 --> 29:59.409

29:59.420 --> 30:00.819
IS FALLING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

30:00.830 --> 30:01.967
ITS UNDERNEATH MY RIBCAGE. YOU

30:01.970 --> 30:02.823
NEED TO FIX IT.

30:02.830 --> 30:04.388
>> YOU RUPTURED YOUR SUTURES?

30:04.400 --> 30:05.367
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO, RUN A

30:07.200 --> 30:08.189
>> THIS IS YOUR FAULT, NOT

30:08.200 --> 30:08.962
MINE, ALL RIGHT?

30:08.970 --> 30:09.959
YOU OBVIOUSLY DIDNT SECURE THE

30:09.970 --> 30:11.278
IMPLANT PROPERLY. HOW COULD YOU

30:11.280 --> 30:13.498
BE SO CARELESS?

30:18.510 --> 30:19.977
HUH?

30:19.980 --> 30:20.981
>> SEAN DID NOT DO THAT TO YOU,

30:20.990 --> 30:23.845
DR. CHRISTIAN TROY. I DID. MY

30:23.850 --> 30:24.544
SUTURES WERE CLEARLY

30:32.400 --> 30:34.197
OH. DO YOU REALIZE IF I

30:34.200 --> 30:35.189
WAS A REGULAR PATIENT, YOU COULD

30:35.200 --> 30:36.519
BE SUED FOR MALPRACT ICE?

30:36.530 --> 30:37.497
>> IT IS COMPLETELY MY MISTAKE,

30:37.500 --> 30:40.219
SIR.

30:40.230 --> 30:41.265
>> RAJEESH, YOU WERE THE ONE WHO

30:42.340 --> 30:45.867
IMPLANT?

30:45.870 --> 30:46.859
>> YES, BUT I WAS A BIG ENOUGH

30:46.870 --> 30:47.905
MAN TO ADMIT IT.

30:47.910 --> 30:48.899
>> IT DOESNT TAKE A BIG MAN TO

30:48.910 --> 30:50.332
ADMIT HIS MISTAKES WHEN ONLY A

30:50.340 --> 30:51.238
FOOL MAKES THEM IN THE FIRST

30:51.250 --> 30:52.547
PLACE!

30:52.550 --> 30:53.539
>> SINCE YOU ARE THE ONE WHO

30:53.550 --> 30:55.518
TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I KNOW,

30:55.520 --> 30:56.475
PERHAPS IT IS YOUR FAULT AS

30:56.480 --> 30:58.914
WELL.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.444
>> DONT YOU EVER BLAME YOUR

31:00.450 --> 31:02.623
INCOMPETENCE ON ME!

31:10.530 --> 31:12.896

31:12.900 --> 31:16.438
HE DESERVED THAT.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.533
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.004
>> SO YOU REALLY KNOW ENOUGH

31:27.010 --> 31:28.602

CHEMISTRY PAPER FOR YOU. JUST

31:33.390 --> 31:34.311
DUMB IT DOWN BEFORE YOU HAND IT

31:34.320 --> 31:35.412
IN. NOBODY WILL KNOW THE

31:35.420 --> 31:39.584
DIFFERENCE.

31:39.590 --> 31:41.399
I LOVE THIS REFRESHING ALCOHOLIC

31:41.400 --> 31:42.492
BEVERAGE. I NEVER HAD ONE

31:42.500 --> 31:43.421
BEFORE YOUR FATHER BOUGHT ONE

31:43.430 --> 31:44.465
FOR ME.

31:44.470 --> 31:45.459
>> YEAH. I DONT THINK THAT GUY

31:45.470 --> 31:46.459
EVER BOUGHT ME A DRINK IN MY

31:46.470 --> 31:49.325
ENTIRE LIFE. MY DADS A COMPLETE

31:49.330 --> 31:52.606
HARD-ASS.

31:52.610 --> 31:55.033
>> DOES HE HIT YOU?

31:55.040 --> 31:56.007
>> YEAH, ITS BEEN KNOWN TO

31:56.010 --> 31:58.331
HAPPEN, SURE.

31:58.340 --> 32:00.399
>> REALLY?

32:00.410 --> 32:01.616
THAT IS A SURPRISE TO ME.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.919
>> WELL, IT WAS ONLY ONCE. I

32:04.920 --> 32:08.412
LIED TO MY PARENTS. I WAS DRUNK,

32:08.420 --> 32:11.526
AND I SHOVED MY MOM. AND I

32:11.530 --> 32:12.952
DARED HIM TO DO IT.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.997
>> [LAUGHS]

32:16.000 --> 32:17.490
SO YOU DESERVED IT.

32:17.500 --> 32:22.005
>> YEAH.

32:22.010 --> 32:23.307
>> I REMEMBER ONE DAY MY FATHER

32:23.310 --> 32:24.937
HIT ME WHEN I CAME HOME WITH A

32:24.940 --> 32:28.432
"B" FOR MY MIDTERM PHYSICS EXAM.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.635
HE SAID ID EMBARRASSED HIM.

32:30.640 --> 32:31.641
NOT ONE STUDENT IN THE CLASS GOT

32:31.650 --> 32:32.969
AN "A." THE HIGHEST MARK WAS A

32:32.980 --> 32:34.447
"B," BUTI EMBARRASSED HIM. I

32:34.450 --> 32:37.977
WAS 9 YEARS OLD. EVER SINCE I

32:37.980 --> 32:39.618
WAS OLD ENOUGH TO HOLD A BABY

32:39.620 --> 32:41.656
RATTLE, MY FATHER HAS PUSHED,

32:41.660 --> 32:43.457
PUSHED, PUSHED ME TO BE A

32:43.460 --> 32:45.382
SURGEON. HE ALWAYS SAID I HAD

32:45.390 --> 32:46.618
SUCH A GREAT GIFT AND THAT IF I

32:46.630 --> 32:48.222
DIDNT WORK AS HARD AS I COULD

32:48.230 --> 32:49.629
TO BECOME A SURGEON, THAT IT

32:49.630 --> 32:50.722
WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF

32:50.730 --> 32:52.231
MURDER, THAT I WOULD BE

32:52.240 --> 32:53.662
MURDERING PEOPLE IF I DIDNT

32:53.670 --> 32:55.228
WORK AS HARD AS I COULD TO SAVE

32:55.240 --> 32:57.595
MORE LIVES.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.261
> > THATS INSANE.

32:59.270 --> 33:01.340
>> EXACTLY. I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU

33:01.350 --> 33:02.601
SAY TO THAT?

33:02.610 --> 33:03.599
YOUD THINK WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT

33:03.610 --> 33:04.679
I WAS GOING TO

33:04.680 --> 33:05.601
BECOME A PLASTIC SURGEON INSTEAD

33:05.610 --> 33:06.645
OF A HEART SPECIALIST LIKE HIM,

33:06.650 --> 33:07.571
HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE HINT,

33:07.580 --> 33:10.674
BUT NO, NO. HE JUST SAID, "SON,

33:12.220 --> 33:14.256
RECONSTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS, HUH?

33:14.260 --> 33:15.682
NONE OF THIS COSMETIC BULLSHIT."

33:15.690 --> 33:17.009
THIS COMING FROM A MAN WHO

33:17.020 --> 33:19.682
WANTS HIS DICK MADE BIGGER!

33:19.690 --> 33:22.568
SOMETIMES I THINK...

33:22.570 --> 33:24.197
THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO STOP HIM

33:24.200 --> 33:25.724
IS...

33:25.730 --> 33:28.699
IS TO CUT OFF MY HANDS.

33:33.710 --> 33:36.679
>> LOOK. I--I GET IT, MAN. YOUR

33:36.680 --> 33:39.274
DAD PUSHED YOU REALLY HARD.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.714
THAT SUCKS. BUT YOURE ALREADY A

33:41.720 --> 33:43.585
PLASTIC SURGEON. THATS A

33:43.590 --> 33:45.581
PRETTY SWEET WAY TO LIVE A LIFE,

33:45.590 --> 33:46.579
RAJ.

33:46.590 --> 33:48.717
>> BUT ITS NOT MY DREAM. AND

NOW IM 17, AND I HAVE MY

33:50.320 --> 33:54.723
ENTIRE LIFE PLANNED OUT FOR ME.

33:54.730 --> 33:59.599
I DONT HAVE A CHOICE.

33:59.600 --> 34:00.692
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

34:00.700 --> 34:01.598
COOL TO BE A "PLAYBOY'l

34:01.610 --> 34:05.467
PHOTOGRAPHER.

34:05.470 --> 34:06.459
MEANWHILE, MY ENTIRE SEXUAL

34:06.470 --> 34:07.664
HISTORY CONSISTS OF A SINGLE

34:07.670 --> 34:10.207
BLOW JOB...FROM A MAN.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.548
OH, MY LIFE SUCKS, MATT.

34:17.550 --> 34:21.589
>> DONT WORRY ABOUT IT, MAN.

34:21.590 --> 34:22.818
I HAD SEX WITH A TRANSSEXUAL

34:22.830 --> 34:26.618
ONCE.

34:26.630 --> 34:29.656
SEVERAL TIMES, ACTUALLY.

34:29.660 --> 34:34.632
ITS TRUE. OH, MAN. I GOT TO

34:34.640 --> 34:38.690
CALL MY SPONSOR. I SH--SHOULD

NOT BE DOING THIS.

34:43.550 --> 34:45.541
WHAT A JOKE, YOU KNOW? IM

34:45.550 --> 34:46.847
CLOSER TO MY SPONSOR THAN I AM

PRESSURING YOU TO BE A DOCTOR.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.609

41:32.620 --> 41:33.587

41:33.590 --> 41:34.557
NARCISSISM,

41:34.560 --> 41:35.481

41:36.220 --> 41:36.982
HER.

41:37.990 --> 41:38.888
