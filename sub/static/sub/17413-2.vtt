00:14.107 --> 00:15.884
Rise and shine, sleepyheads.

00:15.885 --> 00:19.082
Time for Dez's world-famous
tour bus breakfast.

00:19.083 --> 00:21.344
- What time is it?
- I just told you.

00:21.345 --> 00:26.325
Time for Dez's world-famous
tour bus breakfast.

00:27.794 --> 00:29.429
Ah-ha!

00:30.732 --> 00:32.592
Dez!

00:32.926 --> 00:35.434
Every time you cook,
it's a complete mess.

00:35.435 --> 00:38.637
Yesterday, you burnt the toast so
bad, we had to evacuate the bus.

00:38.638 --> 00:42.798
Then you forgot to put a lid on the blender
and splattered smoothies everywhere.

00:42.799 --> 00:45.613
I'm still pulling
blueberries out of my hair.

00:47.015 --> 00:48.916
- Mm.
- Ewe.

00:48.917 --> 00:52.485
Well, no messes today. Now,
how do you want your omelets?

00:52.486 --> 00:56.298
Forget it, Dez. I'm just gonna go to the
diner and get us some breakfast burritos.

00:56.299 --> 00:59.657
Nonsense. I have fresh eggs.

01:02.661 --> 01:04.662
- Whoa!
- Dez! Dez!

01:04.663 --> 01:06.531
Dez, is that a real chicken?!

01:06.532 --> 01:08.199
Dez, where did you get
the chicken from?!

01:08.200 --> 01:09.956
- Give me the chicken.
- What are you doing?

01:09.957 --> 01:12.438
You're picking that up!

01:12.439 --> 01:15.859
- Oh!
- He did say fresh.

01:23.925 --> 01:26.817
You should probably
go to the diner.

You know what, you guys? I'm a
little worried about Austin.

02:25.536 --> 02:26.892
He should have
been back already.

02:28.354 --> 02:30.331
Oh, that's him now.

02:30.332 --> 02:32.254
Hey, Austin, what's up?

02:32.255 --> 02:34.694
What?! He said there
was an accident.

02:34.695 --> 02:37.039
Are you okay?

02:37.040 --> 02:39.313
Oh no, that's terrible!

02:39.314 --> 02:42.010
- All right, I'll break the news.
- What news? Is he hurt?

02:42.011 --> 02:44.235
No, he tripped and dropped
our breakfast burritos.

02:44.236 --> 02:46.087
Now he has to wait for
them to make new ones.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.460
I'm starving.

02:49.461 --> 02:52.368
You scared me. I thought something
bad happened to Austin.

02:52.369 --> 02:57.583
Me too! I don't know what I'd do without
that blonde-haired little he-devil.

02:57.584 --> 02:59.832
My life would be a
total disaster.

02:59.833 --> 03:01.471
He's my only friend.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.978
But we're your friends too.

03:03.979 --> 03:08.182
Thank you, Ally, but
that doesn't help.

03:08.183 --> 03:10.068
All I'm saying is, I can't
imagine what my life

03:10.069 --> 03:12.652
would be like if me and
Austin had never met.

03:12.653 --> 03:16.650
I love Austin too, but I don't think my
life would have been all that different.

03:16.651 --> 03:19.059
Well, I know he's
completely changed my life.

03:19.060 --> 03:23.113
Before we met, I was just a shy
songwriter with stage fright.

03:23.114 --> 03:26.114
And now look at me.

03:29.086 --> 03:32.394
You don't actually
have to look at me.

03:32.395 --> 03:36.114
My point is, who knows what would
have happened with all of us

03:36.115 --> 03:41.935
if things had turned out
differently that first day we met?

03:47.069 --> 03:48.591
Excuse me.

03:48.592 --> 03:50.872
Excuse me!

03:54.200 --> 03:58.645
Do you not see the "please
do not play the drums" sign?

03:58.646 --> 04:02.486
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll leave now.

04:05.266 --> 04:08.023
Guess who got a job
at Cupcake City.

04:08.024 --> 04:09.686
What happened to your old job?

04:09.687 --> 04:12.093
Oh, I got fired from
the recycling center.

04:12.094 --> 04:14.663
You mean you got canned?

04:15.965 --> 04:18.800
- Get it?
- Unfortunately, I do.

04:20.036 --> 04:21.769
So how's the songwriting coming?

04:21.771 --> 04:23.700
I just wrote a huge hit.

04:23.701 --> 04:25.723
All I have to do is get
over my stage fright

04:25.724 --> 04:29.043
and sing it without
throwing up on everyone.

04:29.044 --> 04:31.327
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

04:31.328 --> 04:34.148
Don't give up, Ally.
I believe in you.

04:34.149 --> 04:37.063
You're gonna be a
big star one day.

04:37.064 --> 04:39.584
Thanks, Trish.

04:41.868 --> 04:45.536
Look, it's that weird kid from school
who's always filming everything.

04:45.537 --> 04:47.638
Hey, do you guys want
to be my friends?

04:47.639 --> 04:51.317
- I don't have any.
- What a surprise.

04:51.318 --> 04:56.133
My sister says it's because I'm
weird, but I don't believe her.

04:56.134 --> 04:57.994

It's good. But if you really
want to make it great...

05:17.703 --> 05:18.929
I need to speed it up?

05:18.930 --> 05:22.018
No, you should slow
it down even more.

05:22.019 --> 05:25.294
Make it soulful.
Here, I'll show you.

05:25.295 --> 05:28.007
Don't touch my book.

05:28.008 --> 05:29.581
Just read the lyrics.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.354
Okay, it should go like this.

05:33.355 --> 05:37.185

05:47.210 --> 05:49.738
You're so talented, Ally.

05:49.739 --> 05:53.196
You're gonna nail that audition I
got you tomorrow with Jimmy Starr.

05:53.197 --> 05:55.201
From Starr Records?

05:55.202 --> 05:58.484
You got me an audition? Wow!

05:58.485 --> 06:00.381
Wait, did you say tomorrow?

06:00.382 --> 06:02.548
I can't sing in front
of him tomorrow.

06:02.549 --> 06:05.451
- I'll throw up on him.
- Oh, you better not.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.820
Ally, this could
be your big break.

06:07.821 --> 06:11.157
But I always freak out when I have
to perform in front of people.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.627
You didn't freak out
in front of me.

06:14.628 --> 06:17.009
- How long have you been there?
- The whole time.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.665
Want to watch me break the world
record for spinning a basketball?

06:19.666 --> 06:22.486
Whoa... sh... I...

06:26.672 --> 06:31.172
We really need to get
that guy a friend.

06:31.710 --> 06:36.390
Okay, this is how you
play Banjo Badminton.

06:39.918 --> 06:41.211
Huh!

06:41.212 --> 06:45.073
Normally, I'd be mad at you, but I am too
nervous about performing for Jimmy Starr.

06:45.074 --> 06:46.658
What's the worst
that could happen?

06:46.659 --> 06:49.584
You yak all over Jimmy, don't get
signed to Starr Records, give up on

06:49.585 --> 06:54.371
your dream and work at your dad's music
store for the rest of your life?

06:54.372 --> 06:56.668
Ally Dawson.

06:56.669 --> 06:58.703
Trish has told me
a lot about you.

06:58.704 --> 07:00.605
I'm excited to hear you perform.

07:01.741 --> 07:04.543
Well, I'm excited to
hear me perform too.

07:04.544 --> 07:07.282
I mean, for you to hear
me while you perform.

07:07.283 --> 07:11.123
I mean, I'll just go play now.

07:11.192 --> 07:15.195
- She's a little nervous.
- Yeah, I can see that.

07:15.196 --> 07:16.346
Who are you?

07:16.347 --> 07:18.859
Oh, he's just some
annoying customer.

07:18.860 --> 07:21.858
Thank you for shopping at
Sonic Boom, now get out.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.163
Hit it, Ally.

07:33.805 --> 07:35.840
That's is a long intro.

07:35.841 --> 07:38.032
I... I... I'm sorry.

07:38.033 --> 07:40.995
I just need to warm up my voice.

07:40.996 --> 07:42.997
Let me do a quick
vocal exercise.

Uh, I can't go through with it.

07:48.620 --> 07:51.589
You two have wasted
enough of my time.

07:51.590 --> 07:52.657
Do, re, mi...

07:52.658 --> 07:55.616
I'm leaving now... la, ti, do.

07:55.617 --> 07:57.355
Jimmy, wait.

07:57.356 --> 08:01.289
Ally may have stage fright, but you
can still hire her as a songwriter.

08:01.290 --> 08:03.144
She's amazing.

08:03.145 --> 08:05.112
She's that good, huh?

08:05.113 --> 08:08.015
Oh yeah. She's that good.

08:08.016 --> 08:09.731
What are you doing?

08:09.732 --> 08:12.792
Xylo-grilling. Burger?

08:14.989 --> 08:17.257
Ally, you play. I'll sing.

08:43.119 --> 08:44.353
You really liked it?

08:44.354 --> 08:47.599
I more than like it. I think
I just found my newest star.

08:48.915 --> 08:51.987
Trish De La Rosa, I'm signing
you to Starr Records.

08:51.988 --> 08:53.904
- Wait, Trish?
- Really?

08:53.905 --> 08:56.545
I love jumping.

09:06.932 --> 09:09.072
Guess who's famous.

09:09.073 --> 09:11.814
I'm on the cover of "Guess
Who's Famous" magazine.

09:14.639 --> 09:16.355
Ooh!

09:16.356 --> 09:17.995
Can I have your autograph too?

09:17.996 --> 09:20.808
You can just make it out to me.
First name, Dez. Last name...

09:20.809 --> 09:22.898
I don't have time
for last names.

09:22.899 --> 09:25.234
I can't believe you're
famous already.

09:25.235 --> 09:26.459
That was fast.

09:26.460 --> 09:29.396
Starr Records released my song
"Double Take" on the Internet,

09:29.397 --> 09:31.685
and it got over
2,000,000 downloads.

09:31.686 --> 09:34.112
I'm an overnight
Internet sensation.

09:34.113 --> 09:35.923
My first hit song!

09:35.924 --> 09:37.538
This is a dream come true!

09:37.539 --> 09:43.313
Yeah, because of me, millions of
people are hearing your music.

09:43.314 --> 09:45.505
You're welcome.

09:45.506 --> 09:48.086
Uh, thank you?

09:48.502 --> 09:51.632
Look, Trish, I know when
some people get famous,

09:51.633 --> 09:54.009
they start to think that they're
better than everyone else.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.812
Don't worry, Ally. That's
not gonna happen with me.

09:56.813 --> 10:00.661
I've always known I'm
better than everyone else.

10:00.662 --> 10:05.464
So, Trish, did you talk to Jimmy
about me directing your first video?

10:05.465 --> 10:07.623
Of course... not.

10:07.624 --> 10:09.825
But I do have a job for you.

10:09.826 --> 10:14.700
How would you like to be the
personal assistant to a huge star?

10:14.701 --> 10:16.577
You expect me to just
give up my dream of being

10:16.578 --> 10:19.116
a Director to run around
doing errands for you.

10:19.117 --> 10:22.621
You're right. I can't
ask you to do that.

10:22.622 --> 10:28.522
Instead of being my assistant, how
would you like to be my friend?

10:29.011 --> 10:32.781
Yes! I've always wanted one of those!
What do friends do?

10:32.782 --> 10:36.084
They go pick up my dry cleaning.

10:36.085 --> 10:37.719
How fun!

10:37.720 --> 10:39.580
Woo!

10:41.408 --> 10:44.953
So, Ally, we need a new hit. But
can you start writing without me?

10:44.954 --> 10:46.478
I got to go get my nails done.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.476
Oh, so I'm just supposed
to close up Sonic Boom,

10:49.477 --> 10:53.936
drop everything, and write you a song
because I've got nothing better to do?

10:53.937 --> 10:55.686
Perfect.

10:55.687 --> 10:57.607
Uh...

10:57.997 --> 11:02.077
Totally set myself
up for that one.

11:05.531 --> 11:08.113
Guess who's ready
to write a song.

11:08.114 --> 11:10.945
I've been ready for
the past three hours.

11:10.946 --> 11:12.813
That's the spirit.

11:12.814 --> 11:16.456
But first, check out all of
this cool Trish merchandise.

11:16.457 --> 11:20.318
This is Trish's signature
perfume, "De La Rosa".

11:20.319 --> 11:22.189

11:22.190 --> 11:24.099

11:24.100 --> 11:26.954
Oh, oh. It got in my eye.
It got in my eye.

11:26.955 --> 11:30.024
That's why we have
Trish tissue paper.

11:30.025 --> 11:33.385
We call them "Trish-ues".

11:34.819 --> 11:37.866
Look, Trish, we really need
to work on these songs.

11:37.867 --> 11:40.968
Oh, you're right. Dez, leave
us alone for a few hours.

11:40.969 --> 11:43.583
Great! I can finally
work on my movie idea.

11:43.584 --> 11:45.368
It's about a giant
crab who terrorizes...

11:45.369 --> 11:46.975
Yeah yeah yeah,
no time for that.

11:46.976 --> 11:49.778
I need you to go to the store
and buy this stuff for me.

11:49.779 --> 11:52.881
"Big-screen TV, leopard-print
couch, diamond necklace".

11:52.882 --> 11:56.842
Man, having a friend
is expensive.

11:57.461 --> 12:00.121
Okay, this song's
called "finally me".

12:00.122 --> 12:02.587
It's about a girl who
overcame her fears and

12:02.588 --> 12:05.771
can finally show the
world who she truly is.

12:10.277 --> 12:14.036

12:14.037 --> 12:15.930
<i>♪ I'm not afraid anymore.</i>

12:15.931 --> 12:17.918
<i>♪ I'm not afraid anymore.</i>

12:17.919 --> 12:20.074
<i>♪ Been writing words on a page.</i>

12:20.075 --> 12:22.153
<i>♪ Because I got so much to say.</i>

12:22.154 --> 12:25.012
<i>♪ Now, I'm taking the stage.</i>

12:25.013 --> 12:26.414
<i>♪ Whoa-oh.</i>

12:26.415 --> 12:28.855
<i>♪ I'm finally me...</i>

12:30.085 --> 12:31.649
Aw...

12:31.650 --> 12:34.109
I can tell you wrote
that from the heart.

12:34.110 --> 12:37.124
But my fans don't want to hear
that sweet heartfelt junk.

12:37.125 --> 12:39.560
They want to hear
how awesome I am.

12:39.561 --> 12:41.874
Here, I've been working
on some lyrics myself.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.635
We'll use these.

12:48.124 --> 12:51.964
<i>♪ I'm so much better than you.</i>

12:52.464 --> 12:56.064
<i>♪ I'm a 10, you're a two.</i>

12:56.302 --> 12:58.234
<i>♪ I'm a Queen, you're a fool...</i>

12:58.235 --> 13:00.158
<i>♪ I'm throne, you're a stool.</i>

13:00.159 --> 13:03.351
<i>♪ You'll never be this cool.</i>

13:03.352 --> 13:06.806
<i>♪ No, you wish you were me...</i>

13:12.463 --> 13:14.323
Wow.

13:14.758 --> 13:15.914
I know.

13:15.915 --> 13:19.148
They're good, right? Oh,
this one's my favorite.

13:19.149 --> 13:22.929
"I'm a Queen, you're a fool".

13:24.661 --> 13:26.875
- Hey, Dez.
- Hey, Ally.

13:26.876 --> 13:29.355
You look upset.

13:29.356 --> 13:31.475
I think we have
the same problem.

13:31.476 --> 13:33.564
Yep. Trish.

13:33.565 --> 13:36.952
I was gonna say we're both
having a bad hair day.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.250
But I guess the
Trish thing, too.

13:42.251 --> 13:45.908
I just feel like ever since
Trish became famous...

13:45.909 --> 13:48.335
I don't know my best
friend anymore.

13:48.336 --> 13:50.427
Wait, she said you
were her best friend?

13:50.428 --> 13:53.872
She told me, I was her best friend.
Clearly, she lied.

13:53.873 --> 13:56.690
- Oh, I feel terrible, Dez.
- Well, of course you do.

13:56.691 --> 13:59.006
Trish lied to you.

13:59.007 --> 14:01.184
But it's not just
the friendship.

14:01.185 --> 14:04.429
Working with Trish is taking
the fun out of music.

14:04.430 --> 14:05.761
I hear you.

14:05.762 --> 14:09.236
I have to put my film making on hold
because of her, I want to be a Director.

14:09.237 --> 14:11.951
Not some guy who runs
every time Trish calls.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.262
Oh, wait. Hey, Trish,
I'll be right there.

14:15.263 --> 14:16.445
Ah!

14:16.446 --> 14:18.842
Man, I was going for
a world record.

14:18.843 --> 14:24.743
Well maybe instead of spinning a basketball
you should watch where you're going.

14:29.793 --> 14:33.093
I feel like I know you.

14:33.302 --> 14:37.982
I feel like I've known
you my whole life.

14:38.631 --> 14:40.319
Oh, I know. We met
here the other day.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.290
That's right. You yelled at me for
playing drums with corn dogs.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.811
Well, see ya.

14:50.044 --> 14:52.038
Oh! Uh, there you are!

14:52.039 --> 14:55.379
I've been waiting almost
five whole minutes for you.

14:55.380 --> 14:58.582
I waited three hours
for you yesterday.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.585
Yeah, but stars don't wait.

15:00.586 --> 15:02.513
Regular people like you do.

15:02.514 --> 15:04.555
Anyway, did you finish
my new songs yet?

15:04.556 --> 15:06.680
No, listen, Trish...

15:06.681 --> 15:10.239
Since I can't write meaningful
songs for you and...

15:10.240 --> 15:14.179
I'm clearly never gonna
be a performer...

15:14.180 --> 15:16.976
I've lost interest.

15:16.977 --> 15:20.217
So what are you saying?

15:20.881 --> 15:23.276
I'm quitting music...

15:23.277 --> 15:25.377
Forever.

15:28.688 --> 15:30.419
How long have you been here?

15:30.420 --> 15:34.560
The whole time.

15:44.990 --> 15:46.910
Whoa.

15:47.220 --> 15:50.416
- What happened to the practice room?
- I turned it into a chemistry lab.

15:50.417 --> 15:54.072
It's my new hobby since
I gave up songwriting.

15:54.073 --> 15:56.725
Don't touch my science book.

15:56.726 --> 15:58.653
Why did you pick chemistry?

15:58.654 --> 16:02.434
Because, duh, it's totally fun.

16:05.661 --> 16:08.764
See, I pour this blue
liquid into this beaker...

16:08.765 --> 16:12.725
And wait for the
magic to happen.

16:17.974 --> 16:19.769
What's the magic?

16:19.770 --> 16:22.672
In three hours, it turns...

16:22.673 --> 16:25.313
A lighter blue.

16:27.696 --> 16:31.356
I'm getting chills.

16:32.897 --> 16:36.360
So you're really giving up your dream
of making music to become a scientist?

16:36.361 --> 16:40.053
You gave up your dream of directing
to be Trish's assistant.

16:40.054 --> 16:42.856
Oh, hey! I am her friend.

16:42.857 --> 16:45.299
Would an assistant run all her
errands, make all of her meals,

16:45.300 --> 16:47.728
and assist her with everything?

16:47.729 --> 16:51.631
Yes, that's the dictionary
definition of "assistant".

16:51.632 --> 16:53.308
Well...

16:53.309 --> 16:59.209
Since when is the dictionary the
authority on what words mean?

17:07.285 --> 17:11.182
<i>♪ I am so much better than you.</i>

17:11.183 --> 17:13.393
<i>♪ I'm a 10, you're a two.</i>

17:13.394 --> 17:15.285
<i>♪ I'm a 10, you're a two.</i>

17:15.286 --> 17:19.078
<i>♪ I'm a Queen, you're a fool.
I'm a throne, you're a stool.</i>

17:19.079 --> 17:22.291
<i>♪ You'll never be this cool.</i>

17:22.292 --> 17:24.569
<i>♪ No, I sing to you
on this stage.</i>

17:24.570 --> 17:26.782
<i>♪ No, I sing to you
on this stage.</i>

17:26.784 --> 17:28.876
<i>♪ I'm at the top of my game.</i>

17:28.877 --> 17:30.997
<i>♪ I'm at the top of my game.</i>

17:30.998 --> 17:34.730
<i>♪ I'm a star and you're lame.
I am cash, you are change.</i>

17:34.731 --> 17:37.724
<i>♪ You'll never have my fame.</i>

17:37.725 --> 17:39.310
<i>♪ So...</i>

17:39.311 --> 17:41.904
<i>♪ You wish you were me.</i>

17:41.905 --> 17:45.984
<i>♪ Got everything you need.
Got no time for jealousy.</i>

17:45.985 --> 17:50.305
<i>♪ Ah, ah. Yeah, you
wish you were me.</i>

17:54.589 --> 17:57.143
I don't care if you
don't like my song.

17:57.144 --> 18:01.231
You're all just jealous
of my awesome talent.

18:03.519 --> 18:05.302
This concert's over!

18:07.981 --> 18:10.746
Don't forget to buy Trish
merchandise on the way out.

18:14.429 --> 18:16.071
I'm so sorry, Trish.

18:16.072 --> 18:20.332
You should be. That
song was terrible.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.982
Don't blame me. Those
were your lyrics.

18:24.983 --> 18:28.619
Yeah, because you quit on me. I
thought you were my songwriter.

18:28.620 --> 18:32.580
And I thought you
were my friend.

18:32.791 --> 18:36.391
I guess you were both wrong.

18:42.487 --> 18:43.813
Tangy.

18:43.814 --> 18:45.581
Sweet.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.562
Nasty.

18:48.329 --> 18:49.815
Hey, Dez.

18:52.533 --> 18:55.550
I just finished arranging your jelly
beans to bring to your dressing room.

18:55.551 --> 19:01.451
I organized them just how you
like them, fruitiest to tangiest.

19:12.813 --> 19:14.732
I'll do it again.

19:14.733 --> 19:16.935
Uh, don't bother.

19:16.936 --> 19:18.433
The concert's off.

19:18.434 --> 19:21.105
Guess who's not famous anymore.

19:21.106 --> 19:26.686
I'm on the cover of "Guess
Who's Not Famous" magazine.

19:26.783 --> 19:29.314
Well, don't give up. You'll
be on the cover of...

19:29.315 --> 19:32.385
"Guess Who Just Made A
Comeback" magazine in no time.

19:32.386 --> 19:35.587
Nah, I don't think I'm
cut out for this.

19:35.588 --> 19:38.828
Ally's the real talent.

19:39.323 --> 19:42.482
So what are you going to do?

19:42.483 --> 19:45.772
Well, I kind of liked all the
behind-the-scenes stuff...

19:45.773 --> 19:48.668
Booking concerts and
negotiating deals.

19:48.669 --> 19:50.200
Maybe I should become a manager.

19:50.201 --> 19:52.836
Then you just need to
find someone to manage.

19:52.837 --> 19:57.074
Who? Pop stars don't just walk
through the door every day.

19:57.075 --> 19:59.355
Excuse me.

20:01.146 --> 20:03.523
I lost everything, Dez...

20:03.524 --> 20:06.857
My record deal, my fame...

20:06.858 --> 20:09.258
Best friend.

20:10.188 --> 20:13.299
I don't have anybody.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.940
I'm all alone.

20:20.903 --> 20:23.938
You're not all alone.

20:23.939 --> 20:27.239
I'm still here for you.

20:29.105 --> 20:31.341
You're right.

20:31.342 --> 20:34.827
All this time, I thought you
were just my assistant.

20:34.828 --> 20:38.514
But it turns out
you were really...

20:38.515 --> 20:40.417
A friend?

20:40.418 --> 20:44.487
I think we both know you're
more than just a friend.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.953
Our lives would have been
awful without Austin.

21:13.954 --> 21:17.282
- I'd have given up my dream.
- I'd have never become a manager.

21:17.283 --> 21:20.740
I'd have done the most disgusting things
because I was desperate for a friend.

21:20.741 --> 21:24.678
- I can't believe I...
- Kissed me? I know.

21:24.679 --> 21:27.847
I was going to say I can't
believe I gave up directing.

21:27.848 --> 21:30.049
Come on, kissing me isn't the
worst thing in the world.

21:30.050 --> 21:32.949
Yes, Dez. Yes, it is.

21:32.950 --> 21:34.503
I'm so happy to see you.

21:34.504 --> 21:37.540
- Never leave us.
- I don't want to kiss Dez again!

21:37.541 --> 21:40.661
What went on in here?

21:41.381 --> 21:43.529
I was only gone an hour.

21:43.530 --> 21:46.236
I'll explain over a game
of Banjo Badminton.

21:46.237 --> 21:48.901
Come on, friend.

21:48.902 --> 21:51.362
Okay, friend.

21:53.107 --> 21:54.741
Austin, wait.

21:54.742 --> 21:56.671
I'm just going outside.

21:56.672 --> 22:00.872
No, leave the burritos.
I'm starving.

22:06.567 --> 22:09.305
You really think things would
have turned out that way?

22:09.306 --> 22:11.739
We were just
imagining the worst.

22:11.740 --> 22:13.782
We were friends
before we met Austin.

22:13.783 --> 22:16.343
I'd like to think we'd still
be friends without him.

22:16.344 --> 22:21.207
Me too, because kissing Dez wasn't
the worst thing in the world.

22:21.208 --> 22:24.628
Losing my best friend was.

22:26.184 --> 22:28.946
Ha! I knew kissing me wasn't
the worst thing in the world.

22:37.892 --> 22:40.364
And I bubble wrapped all
corners on the bus so

22:40.365 --> 22:43.027
if you bump into anything,
you won't get hurt.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.035
Ooh! Ah!

22:45.036 --> 22:50.936
And I put training wheels on your
skateboard so you won't fall.

22:51.959 --> 22:56.150
And here, I made you an extra-safe
breakfast so you can't choke.

22:56.151 --> 22:57.913
Thanks. I love oatmeal.

22:57.914 --> 23:03.814
Well, that's not oatmeal. It's bacon
and eggs, I pre-chewed it for you.

23:06.043 --> 23:08.779
Guy's you think you're
overdoing it a little?

23:08.780 --> 23:12.954
I mean, I know you're worried, but
nothing's going to happen to me.

23:12.955 --> 23:15.998
I'm sure nothing will.

23:15.999 --> 23:17.919
Whoa!

23:20.419 --> 23:23.397
- I hope he's not hurt.
- I'm sure Austin's fine.

23:23.398 --> 23:26.805
No, I was talking about Clucky.
Clucky!
