00:00.211 --> 00:01.422
Previously On Nashville...

00:01.422 --> 00:03.334
I want us to
write our story.

00:03.334 --> 00:04.085
Will you do that
with me?

00:05.386 --> 00:06.627
I go your way, or I live
with disappointing you.

00:06.627 --> 00:08.089
It's your world, baby. I'm
just living in it.

00:08.089 --> 00:09.180
You make all
the decisions.

00:09.180 --> 00:10.801
I'm trying to
reach out to you.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.433
How long are you going to
want to take care of

00:12.433 --> 00:13.804
a cripple and a baby?

00:14.305 --> 00:16.517
The woman who found
me in the field?

00:16.517 --> 00:17.808
She didn't want any
attention from the media,

00:17.808 --> 00:19.230
that's why she
didn't reach out.

00:19.230 --> 00:20.901
We ought to look
for a place together.

00:21.352 --> 00:23.194
This is Randall
St. Clair...

00:23.194 --> 00:24.605
Ms. James, I'm your
biggest fan.

00:24.605 --> 00:27.698
Have you ever feared for
your personal safety?

00:27.698 --> 00:28.819
Yes...

♪ Don't you know
there's about to be...♪

00:33.744 --> 00:34.995
- Sure you're gonna be okay?

00:34.995 --> 00:36.657
- Stop asking me that.

00:36.657 --> 00:37.748
I'll be fine.

00:37.748 --> 00:39.460
- I know. I just feel bad

00:39.460 --> 00:41.372
leaving you home alone all day.

00:41.372 --> 00:42.833
- I'm not really alone.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.626
I've got Cadence and Emily.

00:45.626 --> 00:48.429
And all these damn demos
to listen to.

00:48.429 --> 00:50.381
- Demos?

00:50.381 --> 00:52.263
- Yeah. Glenn wants me

00:52.263 --> 00:53.674
to start thinking about
recording again.

00:53.674 --> 00:57.388
He thinks it will motivate
my recuperation.

00:57.388 --> 00:59.230
- What do you think?

00:59.230 --> 01:00.441
- I think he's insane.

01:00.441 --> 01:02.062
- What's wrong with this one?

01:03.644 --> 01:05.316
- To sell the song,
you'd have to do it

01:05.316 --> 01:07.528
in a mini skirt,

01:07.528 --> 01:08.819
and six-inch stilettos.

01:08.819 --> 01:11.402
- You'll get there.

01:11.402 --> 01:12.693
I promise.

01:14.905 --> 01:16.076
Hey...

01:18.869 --> 01:21.081
- Sorry. I'm just
having a morning.

01:22.913 --> 01:24.625
- You're entitled
to have a morning.

01:28.048 --> 01:29.420
I think you're amazing.

01:30.421 --> 01:31.842
I gotta go.

01:31.842 --> 01:32.923
- Go.

01:32.923 --> 01:34.925
And tell Deacon hello for me.

01:34.925 --> 01:36.717
- I will, and Maddie.

01:36.717 --> 01:38.349
She starts her internship
at the studio today.

01:38.349 --> 01:39.430
- Really?

01:39.430 --> 01:40.811
Rayna and Deacon think

01:40.811 --> 01:42.683
they can slow her roll?

01:42.683 --> 01:44.185
- That's the plan.
- Huh.

01:44.185 --> 01:46.437
Good luck keeping that
genie in a bottle.

01:46.437 --> 01:47.898
- Call me if you need anything.

02:22.223 --> 02:23.894
- This button lets
you buzz people in.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.856
And these three connect you
to the control rooms.

02:25.856 --> 02:27.398
- Got it.

02:27.398 --> 02:29.610
- But whatever you do,
don't push this one.

02:29.610 --> 02:31.031
Push that, and we're
all screwed.

02:31.031 --> 02:32.773
- Wait. What one?
- Just kidding.

02:32.773 --> 02:33.944
You're gonna be great.

02:36.277 --> 02:37.908
- This is a lot of buttons
to keep track of.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.741
- Your mom and I
are real proud of you.

02:40.741 --> 02:42.783
Starting from the ground up
like this?

02:42.783 --> 02:43.994
Shows a lot of character.

02:43.994 --> 02:45.496
- I just hope I don't mess up.

02:47.047 --> 02:48.549
Avery!
- There she is.

02:48.549 --> 02:49.840
- Oh, my gosh, thank you so much

02:49.840 --> 02:51.252
for setting this up, seriously.

02:51.252 --> 02:52.463
- Yeah. I'm just glad
it worked out.

02:52.463 --> 02:53.794
Everyone treating you okay?

02:53.794 --> 02:54.795
- Yeah. So far, so good.

02:54.795 --> 02:55.926
(doorbell chimes)

02:55.926 --> 02:57.097
- (over speaker) It's Ashley!

02:58.509 --> 02:59.680
- Is that Ashley Willerman?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.352
- Yeah.

03:01.352 --> 03:03.434
- Like the one who makes those
stupid YouTube videos?

03:04.855 --> 03:05.896
- We're, uh, recording her

03:05.896 --> 03:07.187
first album this week.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.188
- Oh...

03:08.188 --> 03:10.070
- I want to let her in.

03:10.070 --> 03:12.072
Button over there.
- Oh, my gosh, yeah, yes.

03:12.072 --> 03:13.234
(door buzzer sounds)

03:14.775 --> 03:16.156
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

03:16.156 --> 03:17.488
- How's the morning
treating you?

03:17.488 --> 03:20.701
- How about you?
- Good. Well, I uh...

03:20.701 --> 03:22.122
Well, actually I have
this hangover.

03:22.122 --> 03:23.123
It's so bad.

03:23.123 --> 03:25.626
Like the back of my scalp hurts.

03:25.626 --> 03:27.628
Is there a way somebody
could go on a coffee run?

03:27.628 --> 03:28.789
- Maddie?

03:28.789 --> 03:30.791
- Yeah, totally.
- Really?

03:30.791 --> 03:32.963
I will worship the ground
you walk on. Thank you.

03:35.596 --> 03:37.428
(chuckles)

03:41.262 --> 03:43.304
Oh, we're tracking my favorite
today, by the way.

03:43.304 --> 03:44.845
- Yeah, it's a great song.

03:44.845 --> 03:47.808
- Yeah, my manager thinks
it could be the single.

03:47.808 --> 03:49.810
- Okay.

03:49.810 --> 03:52.022
- Do you not think so?

03:52.022 --> 03:53.314
- Well, you never
gave me an answer

03:53.314 --> 03:56.196
about that atmospheric
noise stuff.

03:56.196 --> 03:58.118
- Oh, yeah. I really like it.

03:58.118 --> 04:00.321
I actually got all
these sample sounds

04:00.321 --> 04:02.072
from trains around Seattle.

04:02.072 --> 04:03.574
- Yeah, I know. It's awesome...

04:03.574 --> 04:05.075
- Um, what kind of coffee
do you guys want?

04:05.075 --> 04:07.998
- Black is cool.
- Just cream.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.210
- I feel like my voice comes
through really well.

04:10.210 --> 04:12.463
- Okay.

04:12.463 --> 04:14.084
- I mean, you heard it
on the demo.

04:14.084 --> 04:16.757
- Right. Yeah, we talked about

04:16.757 --> 04:18.969
doing something more
raw and unadorned.

04:18.969 --> 04:20.140
- Well, you talked about it.

04:21.972 --> 04:23.554
- I'd just love it
if you'd try it.

04:23.554 --> 04:24.885
We can always add
the voice back in.

04:24.885 --> 04:26.266
- What do you think?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.311
- Me?
- Yeah. I mean,

04:30.311 --> 04:31.442
you've been doing this
for like 100 years,

04:31.442 --> 04:32.773
haven't you?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.105
- Since April.

04:35.105 --> 04:37.858
I think I'd better let
you two decide that.

04:37.858 --> 04:40.991
- Okay. Well, I like it the way
that it is in the demo.

04:40.991 --> 04:43.954
- Okay. Then do it the way
it is in the demo.

04:43.954 --> 04:45.115
- Thank you!

04:52.042 --> 04:54.675
(guitar playing and knocking)

05:12.353 --> 05:14.104
- Okay, so do you
want extra whip

05:14.104 --> 05:16.527
on your nonfat vanilla latte
with caramel drizzle?

05:16.527 --> 05:18.148
- I have no idea what
any of that means.

05:18.148 --> 05:19.900
So go for it.

05:21.862 --> 05:24.154
- What? Are you a poet
or something?

05:24.154 --> 05:27.157
- Today I am just an intern.

05:27.157 --> 05:28.248
- I feel your pain.

05:28.248 --> 05:30.210
- Who's that guy out there?

05:30.210 --> 05:32.373
- He's been playing around town
for a while now.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.375
He's dreamy, isn't he?

05:36.336 --> 05:37.718
- Yeah, kind of.

05:37.718 --> 05:38.919
- Just wait until you
hear him sing.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.341
you should take two trips.

06:21.341 --> 06:23.093
- Or watch where I'm going.

06:23.093 --> 06:24.635
- You going far?

06:24.635 --> 06:26.136
- Um, no, no.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.768
Just down to the studio
over there.

06:27.768 --> 06:29.179
- Like over there?
- Over there.

06:29.179 --> 06:30.270
- Are you sure you
don't need a hand?

06:30.270 --> 06:31.642
- No, I'm good.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.724
And besides,
you got fans waiting.

06:34.815 --> 06:35.816
- Yeah.

06:35.816 --> 06:37.067
- Sorry I interrupted.

06:37.067 --> 06:38.398
You sound amazing.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.482

07:39.289 --> 07:41.712
- Are you kidding?

07:41.712 --> 07:43.253
Oh, my God!

07:45.796 --> 07:47.508
I've been praying for you.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.680
- I hope you don't mind me
showing up like this.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.972
- Oh, of course not.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.854
- I just didn't know
if you'd want to see me

07:53.854 --> 07:55.556
after I didn't hear from you.

07:55.556 --> 07:57.648
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:57.648 --> 07:59.019
I just felt weird, you know.

07:59.019 --> 08:00.691
My pastor gave me
your phone number,

08:00.691 --> 08:03.564
and I picked up the phone
a couple of times.

08:03.564 --> 08:05.065
But, you're Juliette Barnes,

08:05.065 --> 08:07.027
and I just felt embarrassed.

08:07.027 --> 08:08.488
I don't know. I'm sorry.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.410
- I don't know how
I could ever thank you.

08:10.410 --> 08:11.782
- Oh, please. I mean,

08:11.782 --> 08:14.665
I did what anybody would do.

08:14.665 --> 08:16.456
- You were an angel.

08:18.038 --> 08:20.581
- I'm just so glad
to see you doing well.

08:20.581 --> 08:23.383
- Yeah. I'm not sure
how well I'm doing.

08:23.383 --> 08:26.757
But seems to be a lot riding
on a toe wiggle right now.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.259
But, uh...

08:29.259 --> 08:30.390
I'm here.

08:30.390 --> 08:32.222
- You sure are.

08:32.222 --> 08:33.433
I'm gonna keep praying for you.

08:34.685 --> 08:36.306
- We should get together
sometime.

08:37.638 --> 08:40.190
- I'd like that.
- Yeah, me too.

08:40.190 --> 08:42.693
- I'm sorry. I would invite
you and your friend in,

08:42.693 --> 08:44.064
but I'm on my way out.

08:44.064 --> 08:45.946
I volunteer at the church
on Mondays.

08:45.946 --> 08:49.990
- Absolutely. We'll get
together, make a plan.

08:49.990 --> 08:52.242
- Okay.

08:52.242 --> 08:55.576
Hey, hold onto
that toe wiggle.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.247
I've seen miracles hang on less.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.542
- Hi, I'm Hallie.
- Hi. Emily. Nice to meet you.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.053
(engine sputters)

09:16.847 --> 09:18.348
(engine starts)

09:22.893 --> 09:24.024
- A music video
would be awesome.

09:24.024 --> 09:25.646
- Yeah, totally awesome.

09:25.646 --> 09:26.897
- Well, we've just been
really thinking about

09:26.897 --> 09:28.568
to figure out the best way
to make a real impact

09:28.568 --> 09:29.690
with your new single.

09:29.690 --> 09:31.241
- Since we don't have
the advantage of a tour

09:31.241 --> 09:32.783
to promote it,
we're gonna have to come at it

09:32.783 --> 09:34.034
from a different angle.

09:34.034 --> 09:35.115
- You know, with YouTube
and the internet

09:35.115 --> 09:36.366
the way it is now.

09:36.366 --> 09:38.368
Music videos are a whole
different deal.

09:38.368 --> 09:40.580
Very different from when they
first came out in the 80s.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.912
- That's right, yeah.

09:41.912 --> 09:43.003
- I mean, look at
Ashley Willerman,

09:43.003 --> 09:44.254
the girl Avery's producing.

09:44.254 --> 09:45.585
- Yes. I just heard
about this girl.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.467
Apparently, she had
30 million views

09:47.467 --> 09:48.919
or something on
her YouTube video.

09:48.919 --> 09:50.971
And she's about to make
her first record.

09:50.971 --> 09:53.093
- As long as I get to wear
clothes, I'm in.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.474
- I agree with you on that.

09:54.474 --> 09:55.846
You will be able
to wear clothes.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.517
- I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were in a meeting.

09:57.517 --> 09:58.598
- Oh...
- This is for you.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.480
- Thank you. What is that?

10:00.480 --> 10:02.933
- That's that green drink
I was telling you about.

10:02.933 --> 10:04.725
But I had to mix in pineapple
to cut through the bitterness.

10:04.725 --> 10:07.187
- Oh, thank you so much.

10:07.187 --> 10:11.441
Um...this is Randall.

10:11.441 --> 10:12.612
I'd like to introduce you
to the Exes.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.404
- Scarlett.
- Hey. Gunnar.

10:14.404 --> 10:15.445
- Loved the single.

10:15.445 --> 10:17.077
I'm like obsessed.

10:17.077 --> 10:19.289
- Randall's just come on
to help us

10:19.289 --> 10:21.041
with our marketing
and social media.

10:21.041 --> 10:22.332
And I was just talking to them

10:22.332 --> 10:24.044
about the music video idea.

10:24.044 --> 10:26.506
- Yes. With video, people do the
marketing for you, right?

10:26.506 --> 10:27.958
They tweet about it.
They post it on Facebook.

10:27.958 --> 10:30.130
But it has to be distinctive.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.631
It has to just grab the people.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.803
- Like what?

10:32.803 --> 10:34.134
- Stop by my cubicle

10:34.134 --> 10:35.425
when you're all done, all right?

10:35.425 --> 10:37.307
And I'll show you
some cool stuff.

10:38.849 --> 10:40.520
And let me know what
you think, okay?

10:40.520 --> 10:41.972
And if it's too sweet,
then I'll trade you.

10:41.972 --> 10:43.854
- Okay. Thank you.

10:45.856 --> 10:48.268
- He's so cute.
He has such a crush on you.

10:48.268 --> 10:50.270
- I think he's just
very good at his job.

10:50.270 --> 10:52.402
And I do think he'd be a good
resource for y'all.

10:55.275 --> 10:57.037
(doorbell chimes)

10:57.037 --> 10:58.238
- Package for Maddie?

10:59.619 --> 11:00.951
- Oh, my God.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.412
(door buzzer sounds)

11:04.244 --> 11:06.917
- I think you forgot something.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.629
- My lyrics!

11:09.629 --> 11:11.421
- You left it on the counter
at the coffee shop.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.173
- I thought I was gonna
have to start all over.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.214
Thank you so much.

11:14.214 --> 11:18.058
- Oh, and also I brought this.

11:18.058 --> 11:20.100
- A demo? Awesome.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.512
I will make sure it gets
into the right hands.

11:22.512 --> 11:24.725
- No, it's for you.
- For me?

11:24.725 --> 11:27.567
- Unless you were joking
about my voice earlier.

11:29.149 --> 11:31.651
So why don't we take
this off the pile?

11:34.524 --> 11:38.698
♪ Gonna take these handcuffs
off my wrist ♪

11:38.698 --> 11:41.912
♪ Break every rule

11:41.912 --> 11:45.876
♪ I've got it out for love ♪

11:45.876 --> 11:49.329
♪ I've got it out

11:49.329 --> 11:53.423
♪ Gonna get him in the dark

11:53.423 --> 11:55.505
♪ Hit him in the heart ♪

11:55.505 --> 11:57.097
♪ Where it hurts the most ♪

11:57.097 --> 12:00.971
♪ I've got it out for love ♪

12:00.971 --> 12:05.435
♪ I've got it out
for love ♪

12:05.435 --> 12:10.060
♪ Got no time for crying... ♪

12:10.060 --> 12:11.691
- What's that thing she's doing
with her voice?

12:11.691 --> 12:13.023
- I don't know.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.905
She was doing it yesterday too.

12:14.905 --> 12:16.987
- It's like what Britney Spears
used to do.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.448
- Sounds like she's choking.

12:18.448 --> 12:20.620
- I know. Isn't it cool?

12:22.702 --> 12:25.245
- We gotta get rid of it.
- Yeah.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.416
- Good luck.
- It's her thing.

12:26.416 --> 12:27.577
Everybody loves it.

12:33.463 --> 12:35.505
- My God, that felt so good!

12:35.505 --> 12:37.467
I'm like shaking.

12:37.467 --> 12:38.879
- Yeah. Uh...

12:38.879 --> 12:40.590
Listen, think we can go again?

12:40.590 --> 12:42.432
- Why?

12:42.432 --> 12:43.844
- I'd like to try a few without

12:43.844 --> 12:45.936
that vocal thing
that you're doing.

12:45.936 --> 12:47.727
- Which one? Which vocal thing?

12:47.727 --> 12:49.349
- Well, it's like a catch thing.

12:49.349 --> 12:51.601
Like you got something
stuck in your throat.

12:51.601 --> 12:55.315
- Oh, that's called emotion.

12:55.315 --> 12:57.607
- I hear you, but I think

12:57.607 --> 12:59.279
it would be better
if we feel the emotion

12:59.279 --> 13:00.700
instead of you, you know?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.163
- No. Why?

13:03.163 --> 13:05.285
- Ashley, you have
a good voice, okay?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.867
You don't need to do all
the vocal gymnastics.

13:06.867 --> 13:10.040
People want to hear the real
you experiencing...

13:11.251 --> 13:12.672
- Okay, what do you think?

13:12.672 --> 13:14.174
- About what?

13:14.174 --> 13:16.756
- I mean, you just heard it.

13:16.756 --> 13:18.628
Come on, what do you think?

13:18.628 --> 13:20.510
- If you're asking,
I agree with Avery.

13:23.593 --> 13:25.805
- I don't know why you guys
are fighting me on this.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.888
I mean, shouldn't it
be my album?

13:27.888 --> 13:29.559
- Nobody's fighting you.
It is your album.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.432
I'm just asking you
to trust your own voice.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.734
- Okay, stop!

13:38.608 --> 13:41.651
I'm like so hungry, I can't
even think straight right now.

13:41.651 --> 13:42.993
Can we take a break?
- Yeah.

13:42.993 --> 13:44.494
- Okay.
- Of course.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.746
- Are you guys coming?

13:53.123 --> 13:54.794
- So you really played all
the instruments in this?

13:54.794 --> 13:56.126
- Are you kidding me?

13:56.126 --> 13:57.717
I even took the picture
on the front.

13:57.717 --> 14:00.050
- Oh, Marci...
- Maddie.

14:00.050 --> 14:03.553
- Sorry. Who do I have to beg
around here for a lunch menu?

14:03.553 --> 14:04.965
- Oh, I'll do it.

14:04.965 --> 14:06.386
I just got to figure out
where the menus are.

14:06.386 --> 14:07.888
- Oh, no, no.
They're right down there

14:07.888 --> 14:08.929
in the cabinet.

14:08.929 --> 14:10.100
I saw them yesterday.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.523
Oh, my God, my blood sugar's
like in a freefall.

14:16.436 --> 14:18.939
- Found them! Problem solved.

14:24.824 --> 14:26.486
- Wait a minute.

14:26.486 --> 14:28.578
There's no vegan menu.

14:28.578 --> 14:30.120
I can't eat any of this.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.701
This is like heart attack stuff.

14:31.701 --> 14:34.624
Could you please get me
a vegan menu?

14:34.624 --> 14:35.875
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

14:43.093 --> 14:45.055
(telephone rings)

14:49.179 --> 14:50.350
- Hello?

14:50.350 --> 14:53.103
- Juliette? It's Hallie Jordan.

14:53.103 --> 14:54.854
- Oh, hi.

14:54.854 --> 14:56.686
- I'm not quite sure
what to say right now.

14:56.686 --> 14:58.688
I'm a little thrown.

14:58.688 --> 15:00.650
- Oh, yeah! Why is that?

15:00.650 --> 15:03.903
- I'm staring at a brand new car
in the church parking lot.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.655
Some man just walked up to me,

15:05.655 --> 15:07.077
gave me keys,
and said it was mine.

15:07.077 --> 15:09.529
- It is yours. It's a gift.

15:09.529 --> 15:10.951
- Okay...

15:10.951 --> 15:13.453
that's really,
really sweet of you.

15:13.453 --> 15:16.376
But I can't accept this.

15:16.376 --> 15:17.917
- But why not?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.380
- Well, I mean,
it just wouldn't feel right.

15:20.380 --> 15:21.962
You know, I hope you can
understand that.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.304
- It's just a car.

15:24.304 --> 15:25.805
- It's not just a car.

15:25.805 --> 15:28.178
It's a brand new giant SUV.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.679
It looks like it cost a fortune!

15:29.679 --> 15:31.811
- You saved my life.

15:31.811 --> 15:33.473
Okay? I wouldn't be here

15:33.473 --> 15:35.935
if it weren't for you.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.648
And the car is nothing.

15:38.648 --> 15:40.440
- A car is not nothing.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.483
- Of course, I didn't mean
to suggest that...

15:43.483 --> 15:45.025
- The whole thing just makes me
feel really uncomfortable.

15:45.025 --> 15:47.737
I mean, I really
appreciate the gesture.

15:49.069 --> 15:50.910
But I'm gonna have to ask you
to take the car back.

15:50.910 --> 15:51.951
- What...

15:51.951 --> 15:52.952
- I got a bunch of foster kids

15:52.952 --> 15:53.994
waiting on me right now,

15:53.994 --> 15:55.125
and I got to go.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.206
I'm really sorry. I really am.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.337
And I hope this doesn't make

15:57.337 --> 15:58.878
things weird between us.

15:58.878 --> 16:01.501
But I'ma have to talk
to you later, okay?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.005
- What was that all about?

16:07.547 --> 16:10.390
- Call the dealership,
and have them take the car back.

16:10.390 --> 16:12.302
- Why?

16:12.302 --> 16:14.394
- Don't ask.

16:14.394 --> 16:16.516
- So where'd you learn
how to sing like that?

16:16.516 --> 16:18.858
- My grandpa he was a musician.

16:18.858 --> 16:21.271
He taught me everything.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.273
He taught me blues,
rock and roll.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.694
Hell, even a little country.

16:24.694 --> 16:26.696
- No kidding?

16:26.696 --> 16:28.068
- Oh, yeah. Other kids,
they was rapping.

16:28.068 --> 16:30.410
I was listening to
Blind Willy Johnson,

16:30.410 --> 16:31.991
and Johnny Cash in the basement.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.784
- Oh, I love that.
Where'd you get it?

16:34.784 --> 16:36.576
- My mom made it for me.

16:36.576 --> 16:39.879
Because of this program
she was in.

16:39.879 --> 16:40.880
- Program?

16:40.880 --> 16:43.043
- Yeah, uh...

16:43.043 --> 16:45.175
Transitional housing for women
on the streets.

16:45.175 --> 16:47.547
Like she was in and out
of drug treatments

16:47.547 --> 16:48.928
pretty much my whole life.

16:48.928 --> 16:50.720
So I was raised
by my grandparents.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.932
- Where is she now?

16:52.932 --> 16:55.765
- She died a couple years back.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.519
- I'm so sorry.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.601
- It's not like it was
unexpected, you know.

17:03.353 --> 17:05.195
- Yeah. You are
an awesome performer.

17:05.195 --> 17:06.566
Do you play gigs at all or...

17:09.489 --> 17:10.740
- I don't know. Sometimes.

17:10.740 --> 17:12.952
It just seems like around here,

17:12.952 --> 17:15.535
everybody wants to be someone
they're not, you know.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.417
Or somebody they're not.

17:17.417 --> 17:18.998
- Yeah, I hear you.

17:18.998 --> 17:21.211
Just would be a waste if,

17:21.211 --> 17:22.752
you know, the only people
who heard you sing

17:22.752 --> 17:24.504
are at these street festivals.

17:25.835 --> 17:27.877
- Thanks.

17:27.877 --> 17:29.629
What about you?

17:29.629 --> 17:31.471
I mean, what's up with those
lyrics you left behind?

17:31.471 --> 17:33.093
You sing too?

17:33.093 --> 17:35.175
- Um...

17:35.175 --> 17:36.306
In another life.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.727
(text message rings)

17:37.727 --> 17:40.680
Crap, I gotta go.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.272
- Well, do you need a hand?

17:42.272 --> 17:44.274
- No. As long as there are
no liquids involved,

17:44.274 --> 17:46.146
I think I'm good.

17:46.146 --> 17:47.237
But thank you.

17:47.237 --> 17:48.648
- Well, hey,

17:48.648 --> 17:49.819
can I see you again?

17:51.611 --> 17:53.032
- Yeah. You know
where to find me.

17:56.035 --> 17:57.747
♪ That boat that
he's been rowing ♪

17:57.747 --> 17:59.409
♪ Has been capsized ♪

17:59.409 --> 18:03.163
♪ I've got it out for love ♪

18:03.163 --> 18:06.836
(solos vocals)
♪ I've got it out for love ♪

18:11.551 --> 18:13.052
What now?

18:13.052 --> 18:14.554
- That's just the reverb
in your monitors.

18:14.554 --> 18:15.925
- I know. I like the reverb.

18:15.925 --> 18:17.847
- Look, we can always
add more later.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.679
But right now, it's so loud you
can't even find your pitch.

18:19.679 --> 18:20.890
- No! I have perfect pitch!

18:20.890 --> 18:22.312
It's fine.

18:24.023 --> 18:26.276
- Actually, it's a little
under at the moment.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.191
- Okay. Well, you can
add that later.

18:31.191 --> 18:32.612
You have auto-tune.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.534
- Let's just try one
without so much reverb.

18:34.534 --> 18:35.695
See how it sounds.
- I already know

18:35.695 --> 18:37.497
how it's gonna sound.
Awful!

18:38.998 --> 18:40.660
I know what makes people
like my music.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.792
And I don't need for you to tell
me otherwise, okay?

18:45.415 --> 18:47.207
- Could you...
come inside here please.

18:47.207 --> 18:48.548
- Oh, God.

18:52.712 --> 18:54.844
- No, Ashley, you don't know.

18:54.844 --> 18:56.636
You don't know what makes people
listen to your music.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.598
You think it's about the videos.

18:58.598 --> 19:00.760
You think if you're hot enough
and you shake your bod enough,

19:00.760 --> 19:02.472
and you keep throwing all
this useless crap in the songs,

19:02.472 --> 19:03.603
that people will like you.

19:03.603 --> 19:04.764
- You're an ass!

19:04.764 --> 19:06.266
- No, you're scared

19:06.266 --> 19:08.107
that people won't like
your voice or you

19:08.107 --> 19:09.148
as you are!

19:09.148 --> 19:11.401
You have talent, Ashley.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.112
You've written some
really good songs.

19:13.112 --> 19:14.734
A couple of them may
be even great, but,

19:14.734 --> 19:18.948
you're burying yourself
beneath all this garbage!

19:18.948 --> 19:21.451
- That garbage has
15 million followers!

19:23.493 --> 19:26.165
I'm an influencer!
Are you an influencer?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.418
Because there's not a video of
mine that hasn't blown up!

19:28.418 --> 19:31.130
- Not a video! It's an album!

19:32.712 --> 19:34.294
Look at this room.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.178
This is where
Buddy Holly recorded.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.302
Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan.

19:42.302 --> 19:44.434
Lyle Lovett.

19:44.434 --> 19:47.647
You are in the presence
of the greats.

19:47.647 --> 19:49.899
Don't you want to be great?

19:53.403 --> 19:55.735
Don't you want to at least try?

20:06.586 --> 20:08.037
- What I--

20:08.037 --> 20:10.380
What I want is the goddamned
reverb, okay?

20:19.048 --> 20:21.050
- I'm outta here.

20:21.050 --> 20:23.513
- You going?
- Yep.

20:23.513 --> 20:24.934
- You want me to go too?

20:24.934 --> 20:26.105
- No, no. Stay with Maddie.

20:28.057 --> 20:29.729
- Whoah, where are you going?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.851
- You don't need
a producer, okay?

20:31.851 --> 20:33.313
You need an engineer.

20:33.313 --> 20:35.064
Someone who can push
the faders up and down.

20:35.064 --> 20:36.856
I'm sorry. I really am.

20:36.856 --> 20:38.408
But I think we'll both
be happier if I'm gone.

20:43.453 --> 20:45.124
- I'm so sorry that
took so long.

20:45.124 --> 20:46.125
They were so busy.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.457
- Oh, thank heavens. Lunch.

20:50.330 --> 20:52.672
- What--this isn't whole wheat.

20:52.672 --> 20:53.923
- It's not?

20:53.923 --> 20:55.925
- No, it isn't. Just look at it.

20:55.925 --> 20:57.547
I just waited for an hour.

20:57.547 --> 20:58.638
And now I can't even eat!

20:58.638 --> 21:00.219
- Let me just take it back.

21:00.219 --> 21:02.302
- No. I'll be passed out
in a diabetic coma!

21:02.302 --> 21:03.683
- I'm so sorry.

21:03.683 --> 21:04.974
- I feel like you guys think

21:04.974 --> 21:06.185
that I'm like kidding

21:06.185 --> 21:07.387
about my blood sugar stuff.

21:07.387 --> 21:08.978
But, honestly, it's horrible!

21:08.978 --> 21:10.229
- You can have--Maddie,
give her my sandwich.

21:10.229 --> 21:11.391
You can have mine. Please.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.485
- Well, what are you gonna eat?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.027
- I'm not that hungry.

21:24.664 --> 21:27.166
- Oh, hey, Gunnar found
three videos they liked.

21:27.166 --> 21:29.709
- Oh, good. Now we just have to
find a director we can afford.

21:29.709 --> 21:31.671
- Rayna!
- Yes?

21:31.671 --> 21:33.002
- Would you mind giving
my demo a listen?

21:33.002 --> 21:34.414
- Uh...
- I'm sorry, buddy.

21:34.414 --> 21:36.175
We don't take unsolicited
material.

21:36.175 --> 21:38.468
- Okay. Can I get
a picture then?

21:38.468 --> 21:39.839
- Oh, you know what?
I'm in a big rush

21:39.839 --> 21:41.220
I'm trying to get home
to my daughter.

21:41.220 --> 21:42.422
- It won't take long.

21:42.422 --> 21:43.593
Do you mind?

21:43.593 --> 21:45.134
- Sure. We'll do it real fast.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.019
- Does that mean
she's back home then?

21:50.019 --> 21:51.310
- Who?

21:51.310 --> 21:53.062
- Maddie.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.064
- Yeah, okay.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.696
Take care. Bye.
- Thank you.

21:58.698 --> 22:00.199
- You okay?

22:00.199 --> 22:02.241
- This just reminds me
how public it all was.

22:02.241 --> 22:03.783
- The hearing?

22:03.783 --> 22:05.825
- Yeah, I know.
It was such a bad time.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.497
I want this internship
to work out

22:07.497 --> 22:09.749
so we can have a little sense
of normalcy, you know?

22:11.711 --> 22:13.833
- You'd think I killed her cat,
the way she went on about it.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.165
I'm like, it's just
a sandwich, girl.

22:16.165 --> 22:17.507
Get a grip!

22:17.507 --> 22:19.298
- Is she really that bad?

22:19.298 --> 22:20.880
- She got a lot on her plate.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.922
It's tough doing your
first album, Maddie.

22:22.922 --> 22:25.094
- Okay, it's not like
she's Taylor Swift.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.636
Have you seen her music videos?

22:26.636 --> 22:27.927
- Well, to hear her tell it,

22:27.927 --> 22:29.178
the last one got 15
million views.

22:29.178 --> 22:31.350
She must be doing
something right.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.182
- You should have seen her
bossing me around all day.

22:33.182 --> 22:36.235
"I'll have a nonfat vanilla
latte with caramel drizzle."

22:36.235 --> 22:38.237
I mean, who even drinks that?

22:38.237 --> 22:39.569
Like I was her servant.

22:39.569 --> 22:40.740
- Isn't that your job?

22:40.740 --> 22:41.901
- What?

22:41.901 --> 22:43.613
- You're an intern.

22:43.613 --> 22:45.405
That's literally what
you get paid to do.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.117
(door opens)

22:48.117 --> 22:49.328
- Hello.

22:49.328 --> 22:50.490
- Hey.

22:52.291 --> 22:53.453
- There she is!

22:53.453 --> 22:54.624
How was your first day at work?

22:54.624 --> 22:56.085
- Why don't you ask Daphne?

22:56.085 --> 22:57.497
She seems to know more
about it than I do.

23:01.921 --> 23:03.463
- What'd I miss?

23:03.463 --> 23:04.964
- Not a great start.

23:04.964 --> 23:06.265
- What happened?

23:06.265 --> 23:07.306
- Well, first of all,
Avery quit.

23:07.306 --> 23:09.429
- (gasp) You're kidding!

23:09.429 --> 23:11.390
- No. Ashley Willerman's the
smartest person in the world.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.892
You didn't know that?

23:12.892 --> 23:14.313
She's a true genius.

23:14.313 --> 23:16.395
Never gets anything wrong,
always right.

23:16.395 --> 23:20.149
- Mm, and she's 21?
- Yep.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.901
- How'd Maddie do?

23:21.901 --> 23:24.524
- Let's just say she didn't
help the situation.

23:27.617 --> 23:29.328
- I'm just glad you were there.

23:30.790 --> 23:32.742
Sounds like a wonderful
day, honey.

23:32.742 --> 23:35.625
- Oh, yeah.

23:35.625 --> 23:37.206
- Oh, my God,

23:37.206 --> 23:38.838
I thought I was bad.

23:38.838 --> 23:41.711
- You are a meek sparrow
beside this girl.

23:43.463 --> 23:45.134
- Sorry that happened
to you, babe.

23:45.134 --> 23:46.926
- I officially file
Ashley Willerman

23:46.926 --> 23:48.468
under the "life's
way too short category."

23:50.049 --> 23:51.471
How was your day?

23:51.471 --> 23:54.554
- Well, the woman who saved me?

23:54.554 --> 23:55.765
- Yeah?

23:58.608 --> 23:59.819
- I got her a car today.

24:01.691 --> 24:02.772
- A what?

24:02.772 --> 24:05.324
- I know, I know. It was stupid.

24:05.324 --> 24:08.528
I've never felt so
shallow in my life.

24:08.528 --> 24:09.909
- Juliette...

24:09.909 --> 24:11.951
- And she wouldn't even take it!

24:11.951 --> 24:15.164
Oh, my God, it made it
so much worse.

24:15.164 --> 24:18.077
It was mortifying.

24:18.077 --> 24:20.249
- Why would you think
she would want a car?

24:20.249 --> 24:22.632
- Don't rub it in, okay?

24:22.632 --> 24:25.344
I'm an idiot. It's obvious.

24:25.344 --> 24:27.426
Everything is obvious now.

24:29.008 --> 24:32.141
- What does that mean?

24:32.141 --> 24:34.183
- Tell me this is
what you imagined.

24:34.183 --> 24:36.556
Pushing me around for
the rest of my life

24:36.556 --> 24:38.898
in a wheelchair
like a sack of potatoes.

24:38.898 --> 24:40.650
- It's not gonna be forever.

24:40.650 --> 24:42.652
I keep telling you
to be patient.

24:42.652 --> 24:45.364
- I'm sick of being patient!

24:45.364 --> 24:47.777
Sick of smiling at everybody.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.909
And putting on a good face!

24:49.909 --> 24:51.781
And if one more person asks me

24:51.781 --> 24:54.283
to wiggle my toe,
I'm gonna scream!

24:54.283 --> 24:55.875
- Babe, they said
it's gonna take a while

24:55.875 --> 24:57.326
before we know for sure.

24:57.326 --> 25:00.960
- I know now, okay?

25:00.960 --> 25:02.421
I don't need some doctor

25:02.421 --> 25:05.174
telling me that it's over!

25:05.174 --> 25:06.385
I'm never gonna get better.

25:06.385 --> 25:07.797
- Don't say that.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.508
- I should have died
in that plane crash.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.681
We both know that.

25:11.681 --> 25:13.132
You'd be better off.

25:13.132 --> 25:14.183
Heck, I'd be better off!

25:14.183 --> 25:15.514
- Don't ever say that!

25:15.514 --> 25:16.686
- It's the truth!

25:18.347 --> 25:20.349
(baby cries)

25:22.271 --> 25:23.312
- I'll get her.

25:23.312 --> 25:24.694
- No, I want to do it.

25:34.363 --> 25:38.287
- Look, I know how futile this
must all seem right now.

25:38.287 --> 25:42.371
And if you can't
see your way through,

25:42.371 --> 25:44.463
then I'll see it for you.

25:51.591 --> 25:54.974
What happened? What's wrong?

25:54.974 --> 25:58.768
- She just peed.

25:58.768 --> 26:01.100
- You want me to take her?

26:01.100 --> 26:03.482
- She just peed on my legs

26:03.482 --> 26:07.066
and I felt it.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.317
- What?

26:08.317 --> 26:10.740
- I felt it!

26:10.740 --> 26:13.993
- Oh, my God!

26:16.696 --> 26:19.498
- I did! Mama felt it.

26:30.299 --> 26:33.302
(mellow guitar)

26:33.302 --> 26:34.844
- Stop, stop, stop!

26:36.515 --> 26:37.887
Okay, um...

26:37.887 --> 26:39.218
that didn't have nearly
enough energy.

26:39.218 --> 26:40.559
Can we do it again?

26:42.642 --> 26:44.223
What?

26:44.223 --> 26:45.434
- I didn't say anything.

26:45.434 --> 26:46.936
- No, I know, but
you looked like

26:46.936 --> 26:47.937
you wanted to say something.

26:47.937 --> 26:49.568
- No.

26:49.568 --> 26:51.110
- Oh, my God. Do you want
to quit too?

26:51.110 --> 26:52.321
- Ashley, I'm not
the producer here.

26:52.321 --> 26:54.323
I'm just, you know, a hired gun.

26:54.323 --> 26:56.235
You say play, I say how loud?

26:56.235 --> 26:57.697
That's all I'm doing today.

26:57.697 --> 26:59.949
- I knew today was gonna suck.

26:59.949 --> 27:02.241
- Well, maybe this will
cheer you up.

27:04.333 --> 27:06.085
- I don't eat whipped cream!

27:06.085 --> 27:09.418
- Okay, sorry. I thought you
asked for whipped cream.

27:09.418 --> 27:12.461
- I hope you're not planning on
making a career out of this.

27:12.461 --> 27:15.134
- You don't have to snap at me!

27:16.305 --> 27:18.557
- Excuse me?

27:18.557 --> 27:20.179
- Why are you treating
everyone like this?

27:20.179 --> 27:22.722
We are all just trying
to help you.

27:22.722 --> 27:25.644
Do you even realize
how lucky you are?

27:25.644 --> 27:28.567
You should be having the time
of your life right now!

27:28.567 --> 27:30.439
Instead of whining
about everything,

27:30.439 --> 27:31.610
and being a total bitch!

27:33.482 --> 27:34.944
- Get out!

27:34.944 --> 27:36.115
- Gladly.

27:44.283 --> 27:45.745
- I don't want to see
you back here!

27:45.745 --> 27:47.707
And I'm gonna tell
your boss about you!

28:00.850 --> 28:02.011
- You are kidding me.

28:02.011 --> 28:03.512
- I wish I was.

28:03.512 --> 28:04.643
- What happened?

28:04.643 --> 28:06.305
- She mouthed off to the artist.

28:06.305 --> 28:07.436
Got her butt canned.

28:07.436 --> 28:08.808
- No!

28:08.808 --> 28:11.440
- Yeah. Called her
a bitch, right?

28:11.440 --> 28:12.942
Right there in front
of everybody.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.483
- Lordy.

28:14.483 --> 28:16.816
- Yeah, I mean, not that
it wasn't warranted,

28:16.816 --> 28:18.697
but she's a damn intern.
She can't be doing that.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.119
- No, you cannot.

28:20.119 --> 28:21.320
What do you think we should
do about it?

28:21.320 --> 28:22.661
- I'll talk to Gary.

28:22.661 --> 28:24.623
See if I can salvage
the situation.

28:24.623 --> 28:26.245
- Well, did you talk to her?

28:26.245 --> 28:27.626
- Her? Hell, no.

28:27.626 --> 28:31.170
Still walking on eggshells
around her.

28:31.170 --> 28:32.671
Afraid to raise
my voice too much

28:32.671 --> 28:34.673
or look at her funny.

28:34.673 --> 28:36.175
Don't want her to run off again.

28:36.175 --> 28:38.137
- Honey, she's not
gonna do that.

28:38.137 --> 28:40.009
- Yeah, well...

28:40.009 --> 28:43.142
you heard her on the stand.

28:43.142 --> 28:45.644
- Look, what she did to you
was dead wrong.

28:45.644 --> 28:47.436
But you are still her father.

28:47.436 --> 28:49.348
And I don't care how tough
she thinks she is right now.

28:49.348 --> 28:51.690
She needs you.

28:52.812 --> 28:54.153
- Yeah.

28:59.859 --> 29:01.280
- Hey, hey, look who it is!

29:03.742 --> 29:05.244
- Just came back
for my coffee grinder.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.665
- Not the coffee grinder!

29:06.665 --> 29:08.077
How am I supposed to wake up
in the morning?

29:08.077 --> 29:09.999
- Buy a new one?

29:11.040 --> 29:12.671
- Heads up.

29:12.671 --> 29:13.923
- What are we celebrating?

29:13.923 --> 29:16.255
- Will and Kevin
are moving in together.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.007
- Congratulations, man.
That's awesome.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.678
- Hey, well, that's
the plan anyway.

29:19.678 --> 29:21.881
Gotta find a place first.

29:21.881 --> 29:25.474
- Oh, I heard you quit on
that Willerman chick yesterday.

29:25.474 --> 29:27.887
- Yeah. I think I have PTSD.

29:27.887 --> 29:29.598
- Yeah, not much luck
with the girls you produce.

29:29.598 --> 29:30.890
First Layla and now her?

29:30.890 --> 29:32.101
- Don't forget Sadie Stone.

29:32.101 --> 29:33.732
She killed a guy.

29:33.732 --> 29:34.984
- You're a whacko magnet.

29:36.315 --> 29:38.898
- Thanks for the support, guys.

29:38.898 --> 29:41.400
- How's Juliette doing?

29:41.400 --> 29:43.072
- She, uh...

29:43.072 --> 29:45.494
got some feeling
back in her legs.

29:45.494 --> 29:46.575
- What?
- Oh, my God!

29:46.575 --> 29:48.077
Way to bury the lede!

29:48.077 --> 29:49.368
- Well, she doesn't want
anyone to know yet.

29:51.370 --> 29:52.581
- Why not?

29:52.581 --> 29:54.123
- It's hard for her to believe
things are really

29:54.123 --> 29:56.005
gonna get better. But, uh...

29:56.005 --> 29:57.296
They will.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.258
- Well, that's awesome, man.

29:59.258 --> 30:01.680
I'm so happy for both of you.
- Thanks.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.302
- Maybe now you'll
even have time

30:03.302 --> 30:05.224
to focus on yourself
for a change.

30:05.224 --> 30:07.186
- Myself?

30:07.186 --> 30:08.687
Who the hell is that?

30:08.687 --> 30:10.429
I don't remember.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.695
- Hi.

30:19.068 --> 30:21.200
- I'm sorry about the car.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.742
I didn't mean to offend you.

30:23.742 --> 30:26.245
Or put a price tag
on what you did.

30:26.245 --> 30:29.498
It's not why I came
here yesterday.

30:29.498 --> 30:30.870
- Why did you?

30:34.293 --> 30:36.665
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't be here.

30:36.665 --> 30:38.667
- Wait a minute.

30:38.667 --> 30:41.921
- No, no, no. I have no right
to talk to you about this.

30:41.921 --> 30:43.672
We hardly know each other.

30:43.672 --> 30:45.014
- We do know each other.

30:45.014 --> 30:46.465
Are you kidding?

30:46.465 --> 30:48.427
After what we went through?

30:48.427 --> 30:50.970
Please, you can talk to me.

30:53.432 --> 30:55.734
- I started getting
feeling back in my legs.

30:58.397 --> 30:59.778
I felt it a little bit
yesterday,

30:59.778 --> 31:00.779
and even more today.

31:00.779 --> 31:02.401
- That's incredible!

31:05.114 --> 31:07.116
- Why am I so afraid?

31:07.116 --> 31:09.748
- Afraid? Afraid of what?

31:13.872 --> 31:16.665
That it'll go away again?

31:16.665 --> 31:18.547
- That it should.

31:18.547 --> 31:19.588
- No, no, no, no!

31:19.588 --> 31:21.670
- Yes, yes.

31:21.670 --> 31:25.004
I have been a terrible
person in my life.

31:27.006 --> 31:30.970
And I've never cared...

31:30.970 --> 31:32.771
about anyone but me.

31:36.105 --> 31:40.229
Why did I survive when
everybody else didn't?

31:40.229 --> 31:42.982
It just doesn't make sense.

31:44.944 --> 31:46.785
- I think it does.

31:46.785 --> 31:50.159
I think that someone

31:50.159 --> 31:53.742
wanted you to have
a chance to change.

31:53.742 --> 31:56.705
- I don't know how to.

31:56.705 --> 31:58.877
- Maybe you haven't asked
the right person.

31:58.877 --> 32:01.840
I mean, I'm happy to help, but,

32:01.840 --> 32:03.882
I was thinking
of something bigger.

32:05.965 --> 32:08.927
- If I started praying now,
God would just laugh.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.350
- Not the God I know.

32:20.399 --> 32:21.820
- Can we talk?

32:21.820 --> 32:24.193
- What's there to talk about?

32:24.193 --> 32:25.734
- You got fired, Maddie.

32:25.734 --> 32:27.526
Your second day on the job,
you got fired.

32:27.526 --> 32:29.238
- You really think I plan on
working in a recording studio

32:29.238 --> 32:30.449
for the rest of my life?

32:30.449 --> 32:32.071
- That doesn't matter.

32:32.071 --> 32:35.284
I always taught you do your best
in everything you do.

32:35.284 --> 32:37.286
- Well, no one told me
that meant playing slave girl

32:37.286 --> 32:39.838
to some ungrateful brat who's
not half as talented as I am!

32:39.838 --> 32:41.790
- You're out of line,
sweetheart!

32:41.790 --> 32:43.212
- She was a nightmare!

32:43.212 --> 32:45.544
To everyone!
She made Avery quit!

32:45.544 --> 32:47.796
- It's not your place to call
her out on that, all right?

32:47.796 --> 32:49.388
Do you know how many times
I wanted to cuss somebody out

32:49.388 --> 32:50.299
when I was your age?

32:50.299 --> 32:51.510
- I thought that's
what you did do.

32:51.510 --> 32:53.052
- Then I hope you learn
faster than I did

32:53.052 --> 32:54.723
that sometimes you just got
to take it on the chin,

32:54.723 --> 32:56.055
and watch your mouth.

32:56.055 --> 32:57.596
- She was mean to you too,
you know.

32:57.596 --> 32:58.977
- This isn't about me.
And, come on now,

32:58.977 --> 33:00.269
it's not exactly like you have

33:00.269 --> 33:02.101
a history of
coming to my defense.

33:06.525 --> 33:07.986
I spoke with the studio manager.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.488
If you want your
internship back,

33:09.488 --> 33:10.609
you're gonna have to
apologize to Ashley.

33:10.609 --> 33:12.451
- For what? Being honest?

33:12.451 --> 33:14.113
- If you want the job back,
that's what you have to do.

33:14.113 --> 33:15.914
You don't want it back, fine.

33:18.917 --> 33:20.959
You're just gonna have to figure
out how to make it in this world

33:20.959 --> 33:22.421
when people think
you're too immature

33:22.421 --> 33:23.672
to finish what you started.

33:35.974 --> 33:37.226
- Hey.

33:37.226 --> 33:38.847
Can I talk to you
for a second?

33:38.847 --> 33:41.810
- Sure, yeah.

33:41.810 --> 33:43.312
- Want to tell me
what happened today?

33:43.312 --> 33:44.943
- Why bother?

33:44.943 --> 33:46.235
You're just gonna take dad's
side anyway.

33:46.235 --> 33:47.526
- Not necessarily.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.449
But he is pretty upset,
rightfully so.

33:50.449 --> 33:52.111
- I'm not going to
apologize to her.

33:52.111 --> 33:54.073
If you guys want to kick me out
of the house, then fine.

33:54.073 --> 33:56.825
But I'm not saying sorry
when I don't mean it.

33:56.825 --> 33:59.037
- I'm not worried about
Ashley right now.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.830
I'm worried about your dad.

34:01.830 --> 34:03.662
You gotta make things
right with him.

34:03.662 --> 34:04.833
It's time, and he deserves it.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.045
- What do you mean?

34:07.045 --> 34:08.967
- You said a lot of awful things

34:08.967 --> 34:10.929
on the stand that day

34:10.929 --> 34:14.723
about this man who loves you
more than life itself.

34:14.723 --> 34:15.974
For you to get up there

34:15.974 --> 34:18.307
and distort the truth like that?

34:18.307 --> 34:20.229
In a court of law?

34:20.229 --> 34:22.941
You can't just push that aside,
forget about it.

34:24.683 --> 34:26.275
- Did he tell you this?
- He didn't have to.

34:27.986 --> 34:29.818
You broke his heart.

34:31.740 --> 34:33.282
You are lucky to have a father

34:33.282 --> 34:34.533
who loves you
as much as he does.

34:34.533 --> 34:36.995
That is not a guarantee in life.

34:36.995 --> 34:39.958
Now you're both pretty similar.

34:39.958 --> 34:41.960
You both can be bullheaded.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.042
Don't like to admit
when you've made a mistake.

34:49.628 --> 34:51.840
Sometimes it takes
a bigger person to do it.

35:03.852 --> 35:05.644
- Can I ask you something?

35:05.644 --> 35:07.105
- Sure.

35:09.688 --> 35:11.230
- Am I turning into a bitch?

35:15.614 --> 35:17.616
- A little.

35:20.038 --> 35:22.040
- I hate that.

35:37.216 --> 35:38.307
- You still here?

35:38.307 --> 35:39.678
- Just getting Rayna set up

35:39.678 --> 35:41.139
with a Snapchat account,
then I'll split.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.311
- Okay. Don't stay too long.

35:42.311 --> 35:43.722
- Okay.

36:20.509 --> 36:23.101
(playing guitar)

36:30.068 --> 36:31.860
- Sounds good.

36:31.860 --> 36:34.573
- Yeah, just noodling.

36:34.573 --> 36:36.615
- Wish my noodling
sounded that good.

36:36.615 --> 36:38.447
- Hmm.

36:45.584 --> 36:47.035
- So at the trial...

36:50.959 --> 36:52.751
I never believed
those things I said.

36:56.675 --> 36:58.297
And I said them anyway.

37:00.679 --> 37:03.682
Because I really felt trapped.

37:05.304 --> 37:08.807
And I felt like that was
my only way out.

37:11.770 --> 37:13.772
(sobs) Now I feel like

37:13.772 --> 37:15.564
we can never go back.

37:15.564 --> 37:17.356
There's no way you can trust me

37:17.356 --> 37:18.737
after I lied like that.

37:23.572 --> 37:25.744
I'm just really sorry.

37:27.576 --> 37:30.629
- Thank you, baby, thank you.

37:33.041 --> 37:35.714
- I honestly don't know how
you look at me sometimes.

37:37.296 --> 37:38.507
- Come on.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.432
I'm not blameless in all this,
all right?

37:45.384 --> 37:46.685
I was a hothead and you know it.

37:50.309 --> 37:51.730
Wish I'd been a better dad.

37:55.314 --> 37:57.946
- You're my dad.

37:57.946 --> 38:00.028
So I wouldn't trade
that for anything.

38:08.577 --> 38:11.960
- I thought you'd be jumping
for joy right now.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.712
No pun intended.

38:13.712 --> 38:16.415
The surgeon all but said
you're gonna walk again.

38:16.415 --> 38:18.377
Sooner than you think.

38:18.377 --> 38:21.259
- And I will get there.

38:21.259 --> 38:23.221
I promise.

38:23.221 --> 38:24.513
- I know you will.

38:26.345 --> 38:29.728
Listen, I'm gonna grab some more
of my stuff at Gunnar's.

38:29.728 --> 38:30.729
You be okay for a while?

38:30.729 --> 38:33.061
- Yes, I'll be fine.

38:37.896 --> 38:40.068
- What are we right now?

38:42.781 --> 38:44.152
- I'm not sure.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.367
Are you okay with that?

38:50.158 --> 38:52.411
- No...

38:52.411 --> 38:54.413
and I won't be
till you are.

It's called
"The Girls Who Spill Coffee".

41:29.738 --> 41:31.489
You wanna hear it?

41:31.489 --> 41:33.071
- I would so love to.
But I really can't right now.
