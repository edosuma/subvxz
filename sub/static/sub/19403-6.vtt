01:21.256 --> 01:23.926
If I have to check it, for some reason,

01:23.992 --> 01:26.094
they do random screens of bags at intervals

01:26.161 --> 01:29.398
so someone could see into
this bag on the other side.

05:15.490 --> 05:17.793
Yeah?

05:17.860 --> 05:20.462
Hey, did I wake you?

05:20.528 --> 05:22.330
No.

05:22.397 --> 05:24.967
Um, what are you up to?

05:25.033 --> 05:28.737
I'm just operating on a frog.

05:28.804 --> 05:32.775
- Wow. Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:32.841 --> 05:36.044
- What part?
- Wrist.

05:36.111 --> 05:40.082
- They have wrists?
- Yeah. Sort of.

05:40.148 --> 05:43.151
Well, I... I didn't know
you were gonna be up.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.153
I know you told me not to call.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.890
I was just... I was gonna leave a message

05:47.956 --> 05:52.294
saying that I'm okay and
I hope you guys are okay.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.129
I... I didn't think you'd be working.

05:54.196 --> 05:56.231
I'm not work... Of course, I was sleeping.

05:56.298 --> 05:59.167
You think I'm operating on
a fucking frog at midnight?

05:59.234 --> 06:02.404
- The police station.
- Yeah.

06:02.470 --> 06:03.471
Which?

06:03.538 --> 06:04.572
There's only one.

06:04.639 --> 06:05.808
And it's in there?

06:05.874 --> 06:07.051
They brought the bag in there.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.610
Yeah, early this morning.

06:08.677 --> 06:12.614
With other things. These other things.

06:12.681 --> 06:15.784
You'll be going there today
for your interviews, you men.

06:15.851 --> 06:17.252
Get it back.

06:17.319 --> 06:22.024
It's got my name. It's
got John Lakeman on it.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.090
On what?

06:23.125 --> 06:25.393
On one of those little things...

06:25.460 --> 06:27.162
you tie around the handle.

06:27.229 --> 06:29.932
I'm expected in there today, John Lakeman.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.735
There's a bag with John
Lakeman on it in there.

06:32.801 --> 06:34.602
Has 11 million Euros in it.

06:34.669 --> 06:37.605
Why would you fill out the
little I.D. thing? Jeez, son.

06:37.672 --> 06:41.009
Yeah, well, sometimes I have to
choose between bad alternatives.

06:41.076 --> 06:42.577
What if the airlines just lost it?

06:42.644 --> 06:44.246
Then you guys would be all pissed at me.

06:44.312 --> 06:46.348
We would be all pissed at you, yeah.

06:48.650 --> 06:50.552
Get it back.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.396
While you're in there
today, conduct your interview

06:52.420 --> 06:54.422
like an ordinary industrial engineer,

06:54.489 --> 06:57.692
and get the bag and then this part is over.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.270
While I'm in there trying to look ordinary,

06:59.294 --> 07:01.864
you want me to steal
something from a police office.

07:01.930 --> 07:04.166
This task hasn't even started yet, John.

07:04.232 --> 07:06.434
This bag still has to get
to Iran. That's the thing.

07:06.501 --> 07:09.571
That's the hard part.
We haven't even started.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.637
So get the bag.

07:10.672 --> 07:12.274
And don't cause a dust up,

07:12.340 --> 07:14.709
because you're gonna need
this cover in Iran, you know.

07:17.780 --> 07:19.181
Who's there?

07:19.247 --> 07:21.683
Leslie.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.027
What is it with this fuckin' guy?

07:23.051 --> 07:24.853
Go in there with Dennis.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.121
Who is that again?

07:26.188 --> 07:28.623
My piping friend. He knows about our thing.

07:28.690 --> 07:30.993
Okay, great.

07:37.632 --> 07:39.001
I come in peace.

07:53.949 --> 07:55.583
Okay.

07:55.650 --> 07:58.486
Look, um...

07:58.553 --> 08:00.789
flat out, son.

08:03.158 --> 08:07.830
I'm starting, frankly, to resent you.

08:07.896 --> 08:11.666
Starting really to dislike you.

08:11.733 --> 08:16.238
I'm need very much to calm my rocking boat.

08:16.304 --> 08:20.142
So, let's settle it down here.

08:20.208 --> 08:24.813
I mean, I don't even know
who you are, you know?

08:26.648 --> 08:31.319
I would just like to know
who you really are, you know?

08:35.256 --> 08:40.528
I mean, you seem like two
people sometimes. To me.

08:40.595 --> 08:42.130
Good at piping, poor at it,

08:42.197 --> 08:45.300
undivided attention, then
completely fucking split attention

08:45.367 --> 08:48.070
between piping and God knows what.

08:48.136 --> 08:52.540
I just want to know who you really are.

08:54.809 --> 08:59.214
I mean, I know you're John Lakeman, right?

08:59.281 --> 09:02.184
And I know you like John Lakeman,

09:02.250 --> 09:04.552
and I don't like John Lakeman.

09:04.619 --> 09:06.321
So, fill in that space for me

09:06.388 --> 09:08.490
between what you know about you,

09:08.556 --> 09:11.393
and what I know about you,

09:11.459 --> 09:13.095
so I can like you, too.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.430
'Cause I think I will.

09:15.497 --> 09:19.434
Because I'm Leslie Claret,
I like Leslie Claret,

09:19.501 --> 09:22.237
and I know you don't.

09:22.304 --> 09:26.875
So, I'm gonna fill in that space for you.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.011
Here goes.

09:29.077 --> 09:32.680
I'm Leslie Claret,
youngest of nine children.

09:32.747 --> 09:36.218
Dad was a tugboat captain.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.654
Mom was stay at home, but a modern woman.

09:39.721 --> 09:41.789
She studied architecture as a hobby.

09:41.856 --> 09:44.292
Took me to Paris, France, at the age of 11

09:44.359 --> 09:46.361
so we could see the Sacre Coeur.

09:46.428 --> 09:52.467
I got my interest in design
and engineering from her.

09:52.534 --> 09:54.436
Okay. Now you.

10:04.012 --> 10:06.214
- I'm John Lakeman.
- Yeah.

10:08.917 --> 10:11.219
My dad was a...

10:11.286 --> 10:15.090
tugboat captain, too.

10:15.157 --> 10:18.760
- No shit?
- No.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.728
That's crazy.

10:20.795 --> 10:22.130
Yeah.

10:22.197 --> 10:24.967
I mean, see? Something in common.

10:27.135 --> 10:29.437
How about mom? What did she do?

10:31.006 --> 10:34.542
Mom was also a...

10:34.609 --> 10:36.644
tugboat captain.

10:37.712 --> 10:42.117
Wow.

10:42.184 --> 10:45.020
Brothers and sisters?

10:45.087 --> 10:46.087
Only child.

10:46.121 --> 10:48.656
Well, okay. Okay.

10:48.723 --> 10:50.758
Well, like I said, one of nine,

10:50.825 --> 10:54.362
so, "only child" sound like a
pretty good deal to me, then.

10:57.599 --> 10:59.134
Are you okay, man?

10:59.201 --> 11:00.935
I don't want to talk about it.

11:01.003 --> 11:03.771
Okay, man?

11:03.838 --> 11:06.441
Yeah. Sure.

11:06.508 --> 11:09.444
I mean, I don't even know
you and you're in my room.

11:09.511 --> 11:13.215
Well, I'm going to leave as soon
as the guy with the girl's name...

11:13.281 --> 11:16.184
And because of your son,

11:16.251 --> 11:18.987
I have herpes. I think.

11:19.054 --> 11:22.924
So...

11:22.991 --> 11:23.991
okay?

11:24.026 --> 11:25.227
Could you just leave?

11:25.293 --> 11:27.729
I want to call my wife and tell her.

11:27.795 --> 11:29.407
I want to tell her everything
that's been going on.

11:29.431 --> 11:31.466
Everything that's been going on.

11:31.533 --> 11:33.401
Fuck.

11:33.468 --> 11:36.204
Let me ask you this, John.

11:36.271 --> 11:39.107
Would you like to have a breakfast?

11:39.174 --> 11:42.744
In my room, say? The Electress of Saxony?

11:43.845 --> 11:46.581
Breakfast is the meal where...

11:48.416 --> 11:54.056
Well, it's the optimistic meal, John.

11:54.856 --> 11:57.092
The day's ahead of you.

11:59.227 --> 12:01.029
Let's have a breakfast.

12:04.732 --> 12:06.101
Cool.

12:06.168 --> 12:07.702
It will be cool, John.

12:07.769 --> 12:11.506
Hey, maybe we'll go crazy,
and we'll get a whole spread.

12:11.573 --> 12:15.043
Muffins, breakfast breads, etcetera.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.544
Sound good?

12:16.611 --> 12:18.880
Very much, Leslie.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.183
Well, let's see, we have,

12:21.249 --> 12:22.817
those interviews in a few hours,

12:22.884 --> 12:24.619
those police interviews.

12:24.686 --> 12:25.853
You know anything about that?

12:25.920 --> 12:27.222
I don't.

12:27.289 --> 12:30.192
Well, let's get a breakfast in before that.

12:32.227 --> 12:34.196
- See you in ten?
- See you in ten.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.406
John, can you come in here, please?

12:44.472 --> 12:48.276
This guy says he wants to
tell his wife the whole thing.

12:48.343 --> 12:50.412
He's holding his phone.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.013
Fuck.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.616
I had an erection.

12:54.682 --> 12:56.751
Not from being in a room with a sex worker.

12:56.818 --> 13:00.288
I think mostly I was excited about
helping you gather information,

13:00.355 --> 13:04.392
and one thing led to another and...

13:04.459 --> 13:06.428
I didn't even get you any information.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.838
About where the girl and the passport is,

13:07.862 --> 13:09.397
I just got herpes.

13:09.464 --> 13:11.233
Put down the phone, Dennis.

13:11.299 --> 13:12.700
- Is that his name?
- Yes.

13:12.767 --> 13:14.869
- Yes.
- Put down the phone, Dennis.

13:14.936 --> 13:16.438
I have to tell her.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.840
You can tell your wife you
slept with a prostitute.

13:18.906 --> 13:20.608
I'm okay with that. Go for it.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.944
But you cannot tell
her about this situation

13:23.010 --> 13:24.146
you were drawn into.

13:24.212 --> 13:25.947
Why was he drawn into this anyway?

13:26.013 --> 13:29.584
- I needed his pee.
- I have to tell her, man!

13:29.651 --> 13:32.554
Don't you get it? I have
to tell her the whole thing.

13:32.620 --> 13:35.657
If she thinks that I
was wrapped up in some...

13:35.723 --> 13:38.760
world thing about Israel or
whatever, then she might forgive me.

13:38.826 --> 13:42.864
- Dennis, give me the phone.
- No. Fuck you, sir.

13:42.930 --> 13:46.468
Can you... stab him in
the leg or something?

13:46.534 --> 13:50.037
I did that already. Just
caused complications.

13:50.104 --> 13:52.640
Dennis...

13:52.707 --> 13:54.142
can we get some air?

13:54.209 --> 13:57.912
No. I want to call Audrey.

13:57.979 --> 13:59.847
We should get some air, Dennis.

13:59.914 --> 14:03.351
No, I want to call Audrey.

14:03.418 --> 14:07.522
The only other thing that I might
want to do instead of that right now...

14:07.589 --> 14:08.723
is exercise.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.931
Dennis.

14:16.998 --> 14:18.266
Slow down.

14:20.968 --> 14:23.505
Soft boiled eggs, Quiche Lorraine,

14:23.571 --> 14:25.740
cold smoked salmon, hot smoked salmon,

14:25.807 --> 14:29.411
organic muesli, fresh
apricots, Greek yogurt.

14:29.477 --> 14:33.348
Yep. A whole spread. And
let's add some muffins,

14:33.415 --> 14:36.117
and breakfast breads, etcetera, to that.

14:36.184 --> 14:39.153
Muffins and breakfast breads, etcetera?

14:39.221 --> 14:41.689
That's right. A whole spread.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.691
Seriously, get away from me, man.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.460
I don't want you around me anymore.

14:45.527 --> 14:48.263
Dennis, hang in there a little longer, man,

14:48.330 --> 14:51.132
and then you can just go
back to your normal life.

14:51.199 --> 14:53.000
F you, man.

14:53.067 --> 14:55.803
All these other guys, they cheat
on their wives on these trips.

14:55.870 --> 14:57.339
I never did. Ever.

14:57.405 --> 14:59.507
So I wasn't normal. I was excellent.

14:59.574 --> 15:00.742
Now I'm normal, a-hole.

15:00.808 --> 15:02.176
Dennis.

15:02.244 --> 15:04.746
I don't care about you.
I'm full of shit now.

15:04.812 --> 15:07.582
Look, man, I care about that, I'm sorry,

15:07.649 --> 15:09.984
but I never asked you to fuck anyone, guy.

15:10.051 --> 15:12.019
Guy? I'm guy now?

15:12.086 --> 15:14.956
Dennis, stop.

15:15.022 --> 15:16.258
Dennis.

15:19.994 --> 15:23.064
I won't think twice.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.600
I won't blink.

15:25.667 --> 15:30.772
Imagine something you don't
think I can actually do to you.

15:30.838 --> 15:32.974
Because we're friends.

15:34.008 --> 15:35.443
Yeah, okay.

15:37.712 --> 15:38.713
I can.

15:46.954 --> 15:48.990
Fuck you.

15:49.056 --> 15:53.295
I don't mean fuck you, like I'm
still gonna tell my wife, I'm not.

15:53.361 --> 15:54.929
Just fuck you, man.

16:13.180 --> 16:16.117
God-fucking-damnit!

16:16.183 --> 16:17.919
The Haupfhausen Western European.

16:17.985 --> 16:21.323
Technical Collection Library.
It has to be that book.

16:21.389 --> 16:23.758
Yeah. "Structural Dynamics of Flow."

16:23.825 --> 16:25.159
There should be a bunch in there.

16:25.226 --> 16:26.928
Put my name in one.

16:26.994 --> 16:29.297
You're gonna say you were
at the library that night.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.132
- Yeah.
- Why?

16:31.198 --> 16:32.667
It has to be.

16:32.734 --> 16:34.802
And it has to be that book. Why?

16:34.869 --> 16:38.473
It just does. My interview is at 2 p.m.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.007
Do it by then.

16:40.074 --> 16:41.376
Yeah, cake walk.

16:41.443 --> 16:43.177
I'm goin' right there. A to B.

16:43.244 --> 16:45.547
Don't use... That phrase messes with my...

16:45.613 --> 16:48.750
Sorry. Certainly. I understand that.

16:53.355 --> 16:55.189
John.

16:55.256 --> 16:57.992
I'm followed.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.695
Sometimes. Here.

17:02.296 --> 17:03.731
You know?

17:03.798 --> 17:08.736
You can't be for this today.

17:21.315 --> 17:24.386
Ready for our interviews, John?

17:24.452 --> 17:26.588
Yeah, I guess.

17:26.654 --> 17:30.091
I've decided on my demands, John.

17:30.157 --> 17:33.327
I'd like to discuss them now.

17:33.395 --> 17:35.262
I'm sorry?

17:35.329 --> 17:37.465
Well, you're a liar, John.

17:37.532 --> 17:39.701
You're a big liar.

17:39.767 --> 17:43.471
And you shouldn't take
me for granted, John.

17:43.538 --> 17:47.074
I know things about you.

17:47.141 --> 17:50.211
I might get chirpy.

17:50.277 --> 17:53.415
And that'll be a costly tattle.

17:53.481 --> 17:54.982
What are you talking about?

18:01.489 --> 18:04.225
Where the fuck were you?

18:04.291 --> 18:06.093
I'm sorry?

18:06.160 --> 18:08.696
Breakfast. What the fuck?

18:08.763 --> 18:10.465
Shit.

18:10.532 --> 18:14.368
45 minutes of my time waiting for you.

18:14.436 --> 18:16.170
I had a whole goddamn spread.

18:16.237 --> 18:17.872
Man, I'm sorry.

18:17.939 --> 18:21.509
- Leslie...
- I've had it with you.

18:21.576 --> 18:23.077
Do you understand?

18:23.144 --> 18:26.914
A man asks you to share a breakfast.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.916
There's a whole host of muffins,

18:28.983 --> 18:31.919
and breakfast breads, etcetera.

18:31.986 --> 18:36.424
Invites you to share the optimistic meal.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.760
And you just don't show?

18:40.462 --> 18:44.932
I've had it with your series of
professional and personal slights.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.168
Your lack of fucking common courtesy,

18:47.234 --> 18:49.937
and your shoddy goddamn piping!

18:50.004 --> 18:53.575
You are a mysterious asshole, young man,

18:53.641 --> 18:55.176
and I have had it with you.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.735
Weird energy in here.

21:13.615 --> 21:15.482
What the hell's going on here?

21:15.549 --> 21:18.886
Ce la journÃ©e amener
votre enfant Ã  travailler.

21:18.953 --> 21:20.187
Do you have such a thing?

21:20.254 --> 21:21.555
Which?

21:21.623 --> 21:24.358
Bring your child
to your employment day?

21:24.425 --> 21:25.627
Yeah.

21:25.693 --> 21:27.662
I never do it, but, yeah.

21:49.583 --> 21:50.885
Good afternoon.

21:50.952 --> 21:53.187
You're not compelled to
interview on this day,

21:53.254 --> 21:55.923
but our office is gathering information

21:55.990 --> 22:00.828
concerning the murder
of Hector Barros, age 33,

22:00.895 --> 22:02.930
on the evening of the 11th.

22:02.997 --> 22:05.366
And we've determined that you may have

22:05.432 --> 22:08.535
material information related to the case.

22:08.602 --> 22:11.038
If you refuse to conduct today's interview,

22:11.105 --> 22:13.841
our office will begin the process

22:13.908 --> 22:17.178
of arranging a compulsory interrogation

22:17.244 --> 22:19.146
through a liaison application

22:19.213 --> 22:22.650
with your federal and local authorities.

22:22.717 --> 22:24.185
Thank you.

22:24.251 --> 22:25.286
Murder?

22:29.423 --> 22:31.826
Big liar.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.828
What the
fuck are you talking about?

22:33.895 --> 22:36.330
You didn't go to University of Pennsylvania

22:36.397 --> 22:37.899
as claimed at your interview.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.701
You're a big old liar.

22:39.767 --> 22:42.670
I have the 411 about you.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.440
Peter Icabod.

22:46.507 --> 22:47.541
Yeah.

22:47.608 --> 22:49.310
Are you ready for your interview?

22:51.278 --> 22:52.278
Yeah.

24:27.308 --> 24:30.812
Peter Cassius Icabod.

24:31.979 --> 24:34.281
- Age?
- 51.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.182
Male.

24:38.552 --> 24:39.887
I realize you're a male.

24:39.954 --> 24:41.856
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

24:43.925 --> 24:46.693
Women make me nervous.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.496
Ever... since...

24:49.563 --> 24:51.065
Ever since what?

24:51.132 --> 24:54.201
Ever since I was alive.

24:54.268 --> 24:56.370
Did you interact with any airport personnel

24:56.437 --> 24:59.206
at the Luxembourg airport on the 11th?

25:00.774 --> 25:02.176
No.

25:02.243 --> 25:04.345
Do you have knowledge
of any of your colleagues

25:04.411 --> 25:07.882
interacting with airport
personnel on the 11th?

25:09.851 --> 25:11.919
No.

25:11.986 --> 25:13.487
Please write the following for me.

25:16.323 --> 25:18.359
77 De Champlain.

25:34.641 --> 25:36.710
Where were you on the evening of the 11th

25:36.777 --> 25:39.513
between the hours of 7 and 9 p.m.?

25:41.815 --> 25:45.386
Meeting with our European conforming team.

25:57.631 --> 26:01.135
Your firm has entered
Luxembourg more than 40 times

26:01.202 --> 26:02.503
over the last three years,

26:02.569 --> 26:05.739
has never been connected
to any illicit incident,

26:05.806 --> 26:08.042
great or insignificant.

26:08.109 --> 26:12.179
What's different about the trip your
firm made to Luxembourg on the 11th?

26:15.216 --> 26:19.786
New guy, I guess. That's all.

26:19.853 --> 26:21.588
A new member of your traveling team?

26:23.524 --> 26:26.527
Yeah, John Lakeman.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.250
You made a phone call at 7:10

26:49.316 --> 26:51.852
to a woman named Beth Icabod.

26:51.919 --> 26:52.919
This is your wife?

26:52.954 --> 26:54.755
Yeah, this is.

26:54.821 --> 26:58.125
You mentioned earlier that
women make you nervous.

26:58.192 --> 27:01.462
Yes, this includes my wife, yeah.

27:07.468 --> 27:09.670
Don't put those damn things on me!

27:13.941 --> 27:16.010
What else unsettles you?

27:19.713 --> 27:23.784
Bedding. Hotel bedding.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.019
Insects.

27:25.819 --> 27:27.888
Just those three things?

27:27.955 --> 27:31.225
Um...

27:31.292 --> 27:33.460
one of my fellow employees.

27:35.596 --> 27:38.865
You have fear of one of
your fellow employees?

27:38.932 --> 27:41.802
- Yes.
- Specifically, why?

27:41.868 --> 27:45.606
He's hiding something,
and the pressure of that,

27:45.672 --> 27:49.043
I believe, makes his behavior erratic,

27:49.110 --> 27:54.581
and it creates stress in our workplace.

27:54.648 --> 27:56.250
Which fellow employee?

28:31.052 --> 28:34.188
The detective would like to
see you in the interview room.

28:37.758 --> 28:38.758
Lawrence.

30:48.389 --> 30:50.957
Do you remember any unusual events

30:51.024 --> 30:53.260
or moments transpiring for any reason

30:53.327 --> 30:56.096
over the time you spent at the airport?

30:56.163 --> 30:57.698
No.

30:58.965 --> 31:00.634
Please write the following for me.

31:02.969 --> 31:05.306
77 De Champlain.

31:17.984 --> 31:20.086
Where were you between 7 and 9 p.m.

31:20.153 --> 31:22.223
on the evening of the 11th?

31:22.289 --> 31:25.592
Entertaining two Asian young ladies.

31:25.659 --> 31:27.461
In what manner?

31:27.528 --> 31:30.096
I'm a man of certain responsibilities.

31:30.163 --> 31:31.765
Sometimes, as a stress reliever,

31:31.832 --> 31:35.135
I like to be slapped about and taunted.

31:35.202 --> 31:38.138
Or spanked here and there.

31:38.205 --> 31:40.140
It's not a crime.

31:40.207 --> 31:41.842
No, it's not.

31:41.908 --> 31:44.645
Even where it's a crime,
it's probably not a crime.

31:44.711 --> 31:46.847
Amen.

32:17.077 --> 32:18.879
McMillan is bankrupt.

32:18.945 --> 32:20.547
Are you aware of this?

32:20.614 --> 32:22.115
Yes.

32:22.182 --> 32:24.217
Are your colleagues aware of this?

32:26.687 --> 32:27.687
No.

32:31.958 --> 32:33.894
I've...

32:33.960 --> 32:37.464
kept our financial
difficulties a private matter

32:37.531 --> 32:39.600
to allow our traveling party to focus,

32:39.666 --> 32:42.369
and bolster us through our
important third quarter.

32:44.204 --> 32:46.840
Your colleagues believe
you are here in Luxembourg

32:46.907 --> 32:49.175
satisfying the terms of a contract

32:49.242 --> 32:50.477
with the company Denon

32:50.544 --> 32:52.913
to provide infrastructure
engineering services

32:52.979 --> 32:55.782
in the country of Iran
in the following year.

32:59.052 --> 33:00.854
Is this a fact?

33:03.824 --> 33:04.824
No.

33:07.594 --> 33:11.064
We're traveling back and forth this month

33:11.131 --> 33:14.034
competing with several firms

33:14.100 --> 33:16.303
for that contract for the following year.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.805
Competing to provide services.

33:18.872 --> 33:21.074
My colleagues don't know we're competing,

33:21.141 --> 33:23.410
they believe we secured it.

33:23.477 --> 33:25.346
What such services?

33:25.412 --> 33:27.814
A specific field.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.416
Which specific field?

33:34.220 --> 33:37.257
The Structural Dynamics of Flow.

33:37.324 --> 33:38.692
It is my understanding

33:38.759 --> 33:42.596
that there are five firms
in Luxembourg at this time

33:42.663 --> 33:46.174
competing for this contract
in this specific field.

33:47.377 --> 33:51.104
And your colleagues
are not aware of this?

33:51.171 --> 33:52.806
They are not.

33:59.145 --> 34:01.348
Tell me about your traveling party?

34:01.415 --> 34:02.716
What do you know about them?

34:05.218 --> 34:07.120
My traveling party?

34:07.187 --> 34:08.822
Dennis McClaren.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.393
Normal guy.

34:22.034 --> 34:23.570
Leslie Claret.

34:23.637 --> 34:27.072
War horse. Steady as she goes.

34:30.210 --> 34:33.079
John Lakeman.

34:33.146 --> 34:35.882
What about John Lakeman?

34:35.949 --> 34:37.217
I don't know.

34:37.283 --> 34:39.219
I don't know much about him, really,

34:39.284 --> 34:41.054
except...

34:41.121 --> 34:42.989
Except what?

34:43.056 --> 34:44.525
Crack shot.

34:44.591 --> 34:46.226
Crack shot?

34:46.292 --> 34:48.829
He's unusually good with guns.

34:48.895 --> 34:51.998
That means... It's about all I know.

34:53.900 --> 34:55.411
How long have you
worked with one another?

34:55.436 --> 34:57.003
A few weeks.

34:57.070 --> 34:59.039
And this is your new personnel,

34:59.105 --> 35:01.408
the man who traveled to
our city for the first time

35:01.475 --> 35:02.909
on the day of the 11th?

35:02.976 --> 35:04.310
Yes.

35:04.377 --> 35:06.580
Where did he work before McMillan?

35:06.647 --> 35:08.148
The Pentagon.

35:11.985 --> 35:14.788
Describe the basic nature of your work.

35:14.855 --> 35:18.792
Industrial piping. We create
the structural dynamics

35:18.859 --> 35:21.161
to deliver elements from A to B,

35:21.227 --> 35:23.464
and we provide services concerning

35:23.530 --> 35:27.100
the vulnerabilities of that expectation.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.869
Which expectation?

35:28.935 --> 35:32.305
The simple delivery of
an element from A to B.

35:32.372 --> 35:35.442
We consult concerning
the obstacles, challenges,

35:35.509 --> 35:39.245
and insecurities that come
up against the simple act

35:39.312 --> 35:42.382
of delivering an element
from one place to another.

35:42.449 --> 35:44.618
To name a few...

35:44.685 --> 35:47.688
attrition, gravity,

35:47.754 --> 35:50.591
mischief, calamity,

35:50.657 --> 35:52.425
incompetence.

35:52.493 --> 35:56.162
Also erosion, contraction, expansion,

35:56.229 --> 35:57.698
buffoonery.

37:04.698 --> 37:06.266
Essentially, we exist

37:06.332 --> 37:09.502
because of the tremendous
difficulty inherent

37:09.570 --> 37:14.340
in simply transporting
any entity from A to B.

37:14.407 --> 37:18.144
Are there other firms who
perform a similar function?

37:19.580 --> 37:21.047
There are four others.

37:21.114 --> 37:24.551
And they're all here, as I mentioned,

37:24.618 --> 37:26.987
in Luxembourg.

39:43.189 --> 39:44.190
Can I help you?

39:44.858 --> 39:46.259
Can I help you?

39:50.096 --> 39:53.166
I lost my way. I'm sorry.

39:53.233 --> 39:55.068
What can I help you find?

39:55.135 --> 39:56.737
I believe it's the interview room?

39:56.803 --> 39:58.371
I'm scheduled to be interviewed

39:58.438 --> 40:00.774
along with my firm.

40:02.242 --> 40:03.242
Thank you.

40:32.405 --> 40:35.108
Where were you between 7 and 9 p.m.

40:35.175 --> 40:36.977
on the night of the 11th?

40:37.043 --> 40:40.113
Dining at the King Gerald.

40:40.180 --> 40:42.048
Having a dinner.

40:42.115 --> 40:43.016
With?

40:43.083 --> 40:46.486
Maurice Claire. Denon higher up.

40:46.552 --> 40:48.421
And?

40:48.488 --> 40:49.990
Just us.

40:51.758 --> 40:53.994
Thank you. That's all.

41:08.408 --> 41:13.213
You know, Lakeman was supposed to be there.

41:13.279 --> 41:14.279
Where?

41:17.250 --> 41:20.620
John Lakeman was supposed
to attend that dinner.

41:20.686 --> 41:22.355
Did he not?

41:22.422 --> 41:24.257
He did not.

41:24.324 --> 41:26.793
He came late.

41:26.860 --> 41:28.494
Very late.

41:28.561 --> 41:30.596
At what time?

41:34.467 --> 41:37.503
Had to be after 9.

41:37.570 --> 41:38.771
Sometime after 9.

41:40.640 --> 41:45.078
What was his reason
for missing your dinner?

41:45.145 --> 41:48.014
Some bullshit about his bag,

41:48.081 --> 41:51.184
lost bag at the airport.

41:51.251 --> 41:53.553
Mr. Dennis McClaren said John Lakeman

41:53.619 --> 41:56.857
was with him the moments
before his stabbing.

41:56.923 --> 41:59.025
You're saying John
Lakeman was due to meet you

41:59.092 --> 42:03.463
immediately following that,
and he failed to appear?

42:04.697 --> 42:07.033
That's what I'm saying.

42:07.100 --> 42:09.135
Did you witness him have an interaction,

42:09.202 --> 42:10.736
unusual or otherwise,

42:10.803 --> 42:15.041
with any airport personnel
on the day you arrived?

42:16.376 --> 42:17.944
No.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.882
- But...
- Yes?

42:22.883 --> 42:27.720
But he stayed behind at the airport.

42:27.787 --> 42:30.056
We left in the shuttle, he remained.

42:30.123 --> 42:33.359
Something about his bag.

42:33.426 --> 42:36.897
So I'm not able to tell
you what he did there.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.172
You, um...

42:46.239 --> 42:49.910
You called a non-functional
phone number at 7 p.m.

42:52.745 --> 42:55.448
Yes. I did.

42:55.515 --> 42:56.515
Because?

42:59.920 --> 43:01.654
Well...

43:01.721 --> 43:03.256
Yes?

43:07.493 --> 43:12.698
Well, that's the number of my former home.

43:12.765 --> 43:16.602
I had a habit of phoning my wife

43:16.669 --> 43:19.539
each travel evening at 7.

43:22.608 --> 43:24.010
It centered me.

43:27.747 --> 43:29.983
And I continue to do it,

43:30.050 --> 43:35.455
even though there's no
one there any longer.

43:35.521 --> 43:37.924
I don't know why.

43:37.991 --> 43:41.261
Each of your men phoned your wives at 7p.m.

43:41.327 --> 43:42.929
Roughly.

43:42.996 --> 43:45.932
Yeah?

43:45.999 --> 43:49.369
Kind of a business trip thing, I guess.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.876
Thank you.

43:56.943 --> 43:58.278
Thank you very much.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.022
He's an asshole.

44:10.656 --> 44:11.656
I'm sorry?

44:11.691 --> 44:13.693
Kid's a real fuckin' jerk.

44:15.461 --> 44:16.629
That's all.

44:16.696 --> 44:19.299
For the record.

44:19.365 --> 44:20.633
Hey. Good day.

47:51.377 --> 47:53.145
Mr. John Lakeman,

47:53.213 --> 47:55.080
you're requested on floor two,

47:55.147 --> 47:57.317
interview room 216.

47:57.383 --> 47:59.352
Mr. John Lakeman.
