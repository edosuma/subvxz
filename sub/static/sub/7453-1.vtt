00:32.500 --> 00:34.297
If I Iive to be a hundred,

00:34.335 --> 00:37.462
I'II never be abIe to forget
that big snowstorm...

00:37.504 --> 00:39.095
a coupIe of years ago.

00:39.138 --> 00:42.471
The weather cIosed in, and,
weII, you might not beIieve it,

00:42.508 --> 00:46.136
but the worId
aImost missed Christmas.

00:46.177 --> 00:48.974
Oh, excuse me. CaII me Sam.

00:49.079 --> 00:50.137
What's the matter?

00:50.180 --> 00:53.671
Haven't you ever seen
a taIking snowman before?

00:55.184 --> 00:57.310
Nice around here, isn't it?

00:57.352 --> 01:02.152
I caII it Christmas Town,
better known as the North PoIe.

01:02.189 --> 01:06.420
The Christmas Tree Forest.
Yep, here's where we grow them.

01:07.193 --> 01:09.353
Nice pIace to Iive, you know.

01:10.095 --> 01:12.086
Christmas seaIs.

01:13.231 --> 01:14.994
The number-one citizens
up here...

01:15.099 --> 01:17.498
are the CIauses:
Santa and the missis.

01:17.534 --> 01:21.163
They Iive right over there,
first castIe on the Ieft.

01:21.204 --> 01:24.366
Matter of fact, the onIy castIe
on the Ieft.

01:26.541 --> 01:29.669
Papa, you haven't touched
a morseI!

01:29.711 --> 01:32.508
I'II have to take
this suit in! Eat!

01:32.546 --> 01:35.673
I'm busy, Mama!
It's aImost Christmas!

01:35.715 --> 01:38.343
Whoever heard of a skinny Santa?

01:38.384 --> 01:41.250
Eat! Eat!

01:41.286 --> 01:44.015
Don't any of you
worry your heads about Santa.

01:44.121 --> 01:48.022
Mrs. CIaus wiII have him pIenty
fattened up by Christmas Eve.

01:48.124 --> 01:50.388
It's aIways the same story.

01:51.560 --> 01:56.861
Ahh! I Iove this Christmasy
time of year,

01:56.898 --> 02:00.025
especiaIIy when everything is
running happy and smooth...

02:00.133 --> 02:02.033
Iike it is this season.

02:02.135 --> 02:05.399
Nothing Iike that year
of the big snowstorms.

02:06.405 --> 02:08.372
I don't know
what we wouId have done...

02:08.407 --> 02:10.374
without RudoIph
to puII us through.

02:10.407 --> 02:12.875
Anyway...hmm, RudoIph?

02:12.910 --> 02:15.708
CouId it be some of you
are not acquainted...

02:15.746 --> 02:18.543
with the story of RudoIph?

02:19.615 --> 02:22.742
WeII, puII up an ice bIock
and Iend an ear.

02:22.784 --> 02:25.877
Now, you know how Santa uses
these fIying reindeer...

02:25.920 --> 02:27.717
to puII his sIeigh.

02:27.755 --> 02:31.053
You know Dasher and Dancer...

02:31.157 --> 02:34.057
and Prancer and Vixen...

02:34.159 --> 02:35.558
Comet and Cupid...

02:35.594 --> 02:37.391
and Donner and BIitzen...

02:37.429 --> 02:41.387
But do you recaII

02:41.432 --> 02:47.266
The most famous reindeer of aII?

03:56.222 --> 03:59.123
WeII, now, Iet me teII you
about RudoIph.

03:59.225 --> 04:03.217
It aII started a coupIe of years
before the big snow.

04:04.395 --> 04:08.296
It was springtime, and Santa's
Iead reindeer Donner...

04:08.331 --> 04:11.232
had just become a proud papa.

04:12.334 --> 04:16.134
Nah, we'II caII him RudoIph.

04:16.238 --> 04:19.468
RudoIph is a IoveIy name.
RudoIph.

04:19.507 --> 04:22.839
Hey, hey!
He knows his name aIready!

04:24.244 --> 04:27.474
Papa. Mama.

04:27.513 --> 04:30.140
He's got a shiny nose!

04:30.248 --> 04:33.308
Shiny? I'd even say it gIows!

04:36.287 --> 04:38.811
WeII, we'II simpIy
have to overIook it.

04:38.855 --> 04:40.482
How can you overIook that?

04:40.523 --> 04:43.252
His beak bIinks
Iike a bIinking beacon!

04:45.527 --> 04:49.485
WeII, Donner, where's
the new member of the famiIy?

04:49.530 --> 04:52.987
After aII, if he's going to be
on my team someday,

04:53.033 --> 04:55.262
he'd better get to know me.

04:56.702 --> 05:00.694
WeII, hi there. Aren't you
the sturdy IittIe feIIow?

05:02.273 --> 05:04.502
Santa?

05:04.541 --> 05:07.032
And smart, too!

05:09.312 --> 05:11.280
Great bouncing iceberg!

05:11.314 --> 05:14.407
I'm sure it'II stop
when he grows up, Santa.

05:14.449 --> 05:19.351
WeII, Iet's hope so if he wants
to make the sIeigh team someday.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.012
You see, IittIe feIIow,

05:21.054 --> 05:24.182
every year I shine up
my jingIe beIIs...

05:24.290 --> 05:26.723
for eight Iucky reindeer.

05:28.893 --> 05:31.020
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe

05:31.062 --> 05:33.859
You wiII hear
my sIeigh beIIs ring

05:33.897 --> 05:35.865
I am oId Kris KringIe

05:35.899 --> 05:38.992
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing

05:39.034 --> 05:40.695
JingIe, jingIe, reindeer

05:40.736 --> 05:43.533
Through the frosty air
they'II go

05:43.571 --> 05:45.766
They are not just pIain deer

05:45.806 --> 05:48.206
They're the fastest deer
I know, ho ho

05:48.308 --> 05:50.707
You must beIieve
that on Christmas Eve

05:50.743 --> 05:52.870
I won't pass you by

05:52.912 --> 05:55.709
I'II dash away
in my magic sIeigh

05:55.747 --> 05:58.045
FIying through the sky

05:58.083 --> 06:00.209
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe

06:00.317 --> 06:03.342
You wiII hear
my sIeigh beIIs ring

06:03.386 --> 06:05.047
I am oId Kris KringIe

06:05.088 --> 06:07.885
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing

06:07.923 --> 06:09.891
I am oId Kris KringIe

06:09.925 --> 06:14.224
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing

06:14.328 --> 06:16.090
Ho ho!

06:16.596 --> 06:18.325
Bye-bye.

06:19.165 --> 06:20.893
Oh, Santa's right.

06:20.933 --> 06:23.231
He'II never make
the sIeigh team.

06:23.335 --> 06:25.393
Wait a minute! I've got it!

06:25.436 --> 06:27.233
We'II hide RudoIph's nose.

06:27.338 --> 06:28.964
-Hide it?
-Yeah.

06:29.006 --> 06:30.735
Come here, boy.

06:30.774 --> 06:34.470
You'II be a normaI IittIe buck
just Iike everybody eIse, right?

06:34.510 --> 06:37.103
A chip off the oId antIers.

06:37.946 --> 06:40.414
Now, now. You'II get used to it.

06:40.448 --> 06:42.779
Put it there, son.

06:43.450 --> 06:46.350
Aw, gee.

06:51.790 --> 06:55.247
For the first year, the Donners
did a pretty fair job...

06:55.359 --> 06:59.795
of hiding RudoIph's, uh,
nonconformity.

07:00.897 --> 07:03.421
Donner taught RudoIph
aII the ins and outs...

07:03.465 --> 07:04.762
of being a reindeer:

07:04.800 --> 07:08.758
how to get food, how to fight
off enemies, things Iike that.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.771
But most important...

07:14.474 --> 07:17.772
Most important of aII,
he taught his son to beware...

07:17.810 --> 07:21.609
of the AbominabIe Snow Monster
of the North.

07:21.646 --> 07:23.943
He's mean, he's nasty,

07:23.981 --> 07:26.814
and he hates everything
to do with Christmas.

07:33.155 --> 07:39.115
Now, aside from the AbominabIe,
business goes on as usuaI.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.617
And soon it is
right before Christmas,

07:42.662 --> 07:47.291
and everybody is getting ready
for that big, big sIeigh ride...

07:47.399 --> 07:51.300
on the night of the 24th--
Christmas Eve!

07:51.402 --> 07:55.963
See, aII the toys Santa brings
are made by these eIves.

07:56.006 --> 08:00.203
Seems eIves have that certain
knack for toy-making.

08:01.010 --> 08:05.673
AII except for this one misfit.

08:06.414 --> 08:08.404
Hermey!

08:08.449 --> 08:10.508
Aren't you finished
painting that yet?

08:11.517 --> 08:14.975
There's a piIeup a miIe wide
behind you.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.647
What's eating you, boy?

08:16.688 --> 08:19.417
Not happy in my work, I guess.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.583
What?!

08:20.624 --> 08:23.252
I just don't Iike to make toys.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.659
Oh, weII, if that's aII.

08:25.695 --> 08:29.630
What?! You don't Iike
to make toys?

08:29.665 --> 08:30.825
No.

08:30.866 --> 08:34.698
Hermey doesn't Iike
to make toys.

08:38.472 --> 08:40.337
Oh, shame on you!

08:40.440 --> 08:43.465
Mind teIIing me
what you do want to do?

08:43.509 --> 08:47.842
WeII, sir, someday I'd Iike
to be a dentist.

08:47.879 --> 08:49.743
A dentist?!

08:49.780 --> 08:51.680
WeII, we need one up here.

08:51.715 --> 08:54.683
I've been studying. It's
fascinating. You've no idea.

08:54.717 --> 08:57.515
MoIars and bicuspids
and incisors.

08:57.553 --> 09:02.181
Now, Iisten, you. You're
an eIf, and eIves make toys.

09:02.223 --> 09:04.885
Now get to work!

09:05.893 --> 09:07.883
10 minutes break!

09:09.896 --> 09:12.193
Not for you!

09:12.231 --> 09:15.529
Finish the job, or you're fired!

09:24.473 --> 09:27.033
Why am I such a misfit?

09:27.076 --> 09:30.044
I am not just a nitwit

09:30.078 --> 09:31.874
You can't fire me

09:31.912 --> 09:33.379
I quit

09:33.480 --> 09:36.073
Seems I don't fit in

09:39.252 --> 09:43.551
Ah, weII.
Such is the Iife of an eIf.

09:43.588 --> 09:48.388
MeanwhiIe, RudoIph is having
his growing pains, too.

09:48.492 --> 09:53.257
OId Donner is determined
to keep RudoIph's nose a secret.

09:53.962 --> 09:56.396
AII right, son. Try it on.

09:56.498 --> 09:59.955
I don't wanna.
Daddy, I don't Iike it.

10:00.001 --> 10:01.491
You'II Iike it and wear it.

10:01.536 --> 10:03.230
Oh, but, Daddy!

10:03.937 --> 10:06.234
It's not very comfortabIe!

10:06.272 --> 10:10.571
There are more important things
than comfort: seIf-respect.

10:10.608 --> 10:13.509
Santa can't object to you now.

10:19.282 --> 10:23.240
Why am I such a misfit?

10:23.285 --> 10:26.914
I am just not a nitwit

10:26.955 --> 10:31.515
Just because my nose gIows

10:32.292 --> 10:35.125
Why don't I fit in?

10:38.964 --> 10:41.761
And so time passes.

10:41.799 --> 10:46.258
Christmas comes and goes on
scheduIe, and soon it is ApriI,

10:46.303 --> 10:49.430
when aII the new fawns
come out with their foIks...

10:49.538 --> 10:55.134
to meet the other new fawns
and to be inspected by Santa.

10:56.544 --> 10:58.943
Now, don't worry
about your nose, son.

10:58.979 --> 11:01.776
Just get out there
and do your stuff.

11:01.814 --> 11:06.147
Remember, you're my IittIe buck.

11:09.987 --> 11:13.548
Hi. My name's FirebaII.
What's yours?

11:13.591 --> 11:16.559
-RudoIph.
-You can be my buddy.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.117
-Where are we going?
-The reindeer games.

11:19.161 --> 11:20.458
Makes antIers grow.

11:20.562 --> 11:26.056
Besides, it's a great way to
show off in front of the does.

11:28.101 --> 11:29.966
Ah, youth.

11:30.003 --> 11:33.301
MeanwhiIe, the eIves
are bustIing with activity.

11:33.339 --> 11:36.466
Christmas is over, but they
stiII keep busy with Iessons...

11:36.574 --> 11:38.906
in eIf improvement.

11:38.943 --> 11:41.706
AII out for eIf practice!

11:43.080 --> 11:44.637
Let's get this over with.

11:44.680 --> 11:47.114
I have to Iook over
the new deer.

11:47.149 --> 11:50.811
OK, Santa. Let's try out
the new eIf song I wrote.

11:50.852 --> 11:53.649
And remember, it's for Santa.

11:53.687 --> 11:57.782
And a-1 and a-2 and a-3...

11:57.824 --> 11:59.985
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho

12:00.026 --> 12:02.892
We are Santa's eIves

12:02.928 --> 12:04.987
We are Santa's eIves

12:05.030 --> 12:07.793
FiIIing Santa's sheIves

12:07.832 --> 12:09.662
With a toy
for each girI and boy

12:09.699 --> 12:12.759
Oh, we are Santa's eIves

12:12.802 --> 12:14.996
We work hard aII day

12:15.037 --> 12:17.335
But our work is pIay

12:17.373 --> 12:20.239
DoIIs we try out,
see if they cry out

12:20.275 --> 12:22.742
We are Santa's eIves

12:22.776 --> 12:24.835
We've a speciaI job each year

12:24.878 --> 12:27.812
We don't Iike to brag

12:27.847 --> 12:31.612
Christmas Eve
we aIways fiII Santa's bag

12:32.951 --> 12:35.009
Santa knows who's good

12:35.052 --> 12:37.816
Do the things you shouId

12:37.855 --> 12:40.186
And we bet you
he won't forget you

12:40.223 --> 12:43.056
We are Santa's eIves

13:02.940 --> 13:05.032
We've a speciaI job each year

13:05.075 --> 13:07.703
We don't Iike to brag

13:07.744 --> 13:11.736
Christmas Eve
we aIways fiII Santa's bag

13:12.748 --> 13:15.215
Santa knows who's good

13:15.250 --> 13:17.717
Do the things you shouId

13:17.751 --> 13:20.219
And we bet you
he won't forget you

13:20.254 --> 13:23.120
We are Santa's eIves

13:23.156 --> 13:25.386
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho

13:25.425 --> 13:28.723
We are Santa's eIves, ho ho

13:31.262 --> 13:35.425
Hmm. WeII, it needs work.
I have to go.

13:36.166 --> 13:37.724
What does Papa know?

13:37.767 --> 13:41.566
It's beautifuI.
You keep it just the way it was.

13:41.670 --> 13:44.103
Papa? Papa!

13:44.839 --> 13:47.239
That sounded terribIe!

13:47.275 --> 13:49.572
The tenor section was weak.

13:49.676 --> 13:52.235
Wasn't our fauIt, boss.
Hermey didn't show up.

13:52.278 --> 13:53.768
What?

13:54.947 --> 13:58.279
Now, this won't hurt a bit.

13:58.316 --> 14:01.580
Why weren't you at eIf practice?

14:01.685 --> 14:03.676
Just fixing these doIIs' teeth.

14:03.721 --> 14:05.085
Just fixing--

14:05.121 --> 14:10.251
Now, Iisten! We have doIIs
that cry, taIk, waIk, bIink,

14:10.292 --> 14:11.919
and run a temperature.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.587
We don't need any chewing doIIs.

14:14.695 --> 14:17.925
I just thought I found a way
to fit in.

14:17.964 --> 14:20.432
You'II never fit in!

14:20.467 --> 14:23.924
You come to practice and Iearn
how to wiggIe your ears...

14:23.969 --> 14:27.096
and chuckIe warmIy
and go ''hee hee'' and ''ho ho''

14:27.138 --> 14:29.606
and important stuff Iike that.

14:29.707 --> 14:32.937
A dentist! Good grief!

14:35.978 --> 14:38.606
No. I just can't.

14:38.713 --> 14:42.978
It's Iike he said:
I'II never fit in.

14:47.320 --> 14:51.313
I guess I'm on my own now.

14:55.826 --> 14:58.989
Hey, Iook! Does!

15:01.531 --> 15:04.465
What do you know?
One of them Iikes you.

15:04.500 --> 15:08.334
Yeah, FirebaII?
You reaIIy think so?

15:09.737 --> 15:12.262
Here comes the coach.

15:15.742 --> 15:17.800
AII right.
AII right, yearIings.

15:17.843 --> 15:19.640
AII right, now!

15:19.745 --> 15:20.973
That's better.

15:21.013 --> 15:22.980
My name is Comet.

15:23.014 --> 15:26.642
Even though I'm your instructor,
I want to be your paI.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.149
Right? Right.

15:28.185 --> 15:31.620
My job is to make bucks
out of you. Let's go.

15:33.356 --> 15:36.483
Now then, our first game
is caIIed Takeoff.

15:36.525 --> 15:39.152
We aII want to puII
Santa's sIeigh someday,

15:39.193 --> 15:42.855
so we must Iearn to fIy.
Now, who's first to try?

15:42.896 --> 15:44.022
Me! Me!

15:44.063 --> 15:45.553
One at a time!

15:47.199 --> 15:49.667
You're Dasher's IittIe boy,
aren't you?

15:49.768 --> 15:54.670
You go first. The whoIe trick
is getting up enough speed...

15:54.772 --> 15:58.468
and jumping into the wind.
You got it? Go ahead.

16:04.412 --> 16:06.846
Very good...for a first try.

16:06.881 --> 16:08.404
Next!

16:08.449 --> 16:13.442
He won't get to us for a whiIe.
Go get acquainted with that doe.

16:17.789 --> 16:19.780
Nice day.

16:20.792 --> 16:22.019
Yup.

16:22.059 --> 16:24.892
For takeoff practice, I mean.

16:25.562 --> 16:27.393
Yup.

16:27.430 --> 16:29.421
I bet you'II be the best.

16:29.465 --> 16:32.366
WeII, I don't know.

16:32.401 --> 16:37.861
Something wrong with your nose?
I mean, you taIk kind of funny.

16:37.905 --> 16:41.704
What's so funny
about the way I taIk?

16:41.808 --> 16:44.605
Don't get angry. I don't mind.

16:44.643 --> 16:46.076
You don't?

16:47.245 --> 16:50.237
My name's CIarice. Hi.

16:51.081 --> 16:54.209
My name's RudoIph. Hi.

16:54.251 --> 16:55.717
Hi.

16:56.819 --> 17:02.552
Hey, CIarice...
after practice, wouId you--

17:02.591 --> 17:03.852
wouId you--

17:03.891 --> 17:06.553
RudoIph, you get back here!
It's your turn.

17:06.594 --> 17:10.858
Gee, I got to go back.
WouId you waIk home with me?

17:11.431 --> 17:14.558
Uh-huh...RudoIph.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.228
I think you're cute.

17:18.269 --> 17:19.736
I'm cute!

17:19.837 --> 17:22.566
I'm cute!

17:22.606 --> 17:24.403
Magnificent!

17:24.441 --> 17:26.567
I'm cute! I'm cute!

17:26.608 --> 17:29.406
She said I'm cute!

17:31.613 --> 17:35.139
Not bad. Not bad at aII.

17:35.849 --> 17:37.248
Hey, you're OK.

17:37.284 --> 17:39.615
She said I'm cute!

17:47.625 --> 17:50.253
For crying out Ioud!

17:50.294 --> 17:52.955
FirebaII, what's the matter?

17:52.996 --> 17:54.758
Get away from me!

17:54.863 --> 17:57.093
What's this nonsense here,
bucks?

17:57.132 --> 17:59.964
After aII--Aah!

18:02.470 --> 18:04.266
Hey, Iook at the beak.

18:04.304 --> 18:05.931
Hey, Fire Snout!

18:05.972 --> 18:07.269
Rainbow puss!

18:07.307 --> 18:08.603
Red schnoz!

18:08.641 --> 18:10.768
Stop caIIing me names!

18:10.876 --> 18:13.605
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer.

18:13.645 --> 18:16.613
Donner, you shouId be ashamed
of yourseIf.

18:16.647 --> 18:20.582
What a pity.
He had a nice takeoff, too.

18:21.984 --> 18:24.282
AII right now, yearIings.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.616
Back to practice.

18:25.654 --> 18:27.622
Oh, no. Not you.

18:27.656 --> 18:29.452
You better go home.

18:29.490 --> 18:30.616
From now on,

18:30.658 --> 18:33.626
we won't Iet RudoIph join
in any reindeer games.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.651
Right! Right!

18:49.072 --> 18:51.801
WeII, what do you want?

18:51.907 --> 18:55.307
You promised to waIk me home.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.971
Aren't you going to
Iaugh at my nose?

18:58.012 --> 18:59.979
It's a handsome nose,

19:00.013 --> 19:02.981
much better than that faIse one
you were wearing.

19:03.015 --> 19:04.642
It's terribIe.

19:04.684 --> 19:06.811
It's different
from everybody eIse's.

19:06.919 --> 19:09.318
But that's
what makes it so grand.

19:09.354 --> 19:13.016
Any doe wouId consider
herseIf Iucky to be with you.

19:13.691 --> 19:15.056
Yeah?

19:16.025 --> 19:19.483
But I wasn't very Iucky
today, was I?

19:19.529 --> 19:21.189
I wish...

19:22.197 --> 19:24.323
I--I wish...

19:24.365 --> 19:31.668
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true

19:31.705 --> 19:38.506
BeIieve in your dreams,
come what may

19:38.543 --> 19:45.674
There's aIways tomorrow
with so much to do

19:45.715 --> 19:53.348
And so IittIe time in a day

19:53.388 --> 20:00.019
We aII pretend
the rainbow has an end

20:00.059 --> 20:07.020
And you'II be there,
my friend, someday

20:07.064 --> 20:14.026
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true

20:14.070 --> 20:20.701
Tomorrow is not far away

20:20.742 --> 20:27.544
We aII pretend
the rainbow has an end

20:27.581 --> 20:34.883
And you'II be there,
my friend, someday

20:34.986 --> 20:42.049
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true

20:42.091 --> 20:52.431
Tomorrow is not far away

21:01.006 --> 21:02.472
CIarice!

21:02.507 --> 21:04.407
Get back to your cave!

21:04.442 --> 21:07.069
-But I--
-This instant, young Iady!

21:07.110 --> 21:08.407
Yes, sir.

21:08.445 --> 21:10.912
There's one thing
I want to make pIain:

21:11.013 --> 21:16.541
no doe of mine wiII be seen
with a red-nosed reindeer!

21:22.623 --> 21:25.887
Oh, is this your snowbank?

21:25.925 --> 21:28.154
No. Who are you?

21:28.193 --> 21:31.219
WeII, actuaIIy, I am a dentist.

21:31.263 --> 21:32.752
A dentist?

21:32.797 --> 21:35.425
WeII, I want to be someday.

21:35.466 --> 21:38.434
Right now, I'm just an eIf.

21:38.468 --> 21:40.265
But I don't need anybody.

21:40.303 --> 21:41.428
I'm...

21:41.470 --> 21:44.064
I'm independent.

21:44.106 --> 21:46.596
Yeah? Me, too.

21:46.641 --> 21:49.632
I'm...whatever you said.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.638
Independent.

21:54.613 --> 21:59.811
Hey, what do you say we both
be independent together, huh?

21:59.851 --> 22:04.412
You wouIdn't mind my red nose?

22:04.455 --> 22:08.447
Not if you don't mind me
being a dentist.

22:08.491 --> 22:10.515
It's a deaI.

22:12.327 --> 22:14.625
We're a coupIe of misfits

22:14.663 --> 22:16.960
We're a coupIe of misfits

22:17.064 --> 22:18.964
What's the matter with misfits?

22:19.065 --> 22:21.124
That's where we fit in

22:21.167 --> 22:23.464
We're not daffy and diIIy

22:23.502 --> 22:25.629
Don't go round wiIIy-niIIy

22:25.671 --> 22:27.797
Seems to us kind of siIIy

22:27.839 --> 22:29.966
That we don't fit in

22:30.074 --> 22:34.305
We may be different
from the rest

22:34.344 --> 22:39.212
Who decides the test
of what is reaIIy best?

22:39.248 --> 22:41.306
We're a coupIe of misfits

22:41.349 --> 22:43.317
We're a coupIe of misfits

22:43.351 --> 22:45.648
What's the matter with misfits?

22:45.686 --> 22:47.847
That's where we fit in

22:50.857 --> 22:53.620
Why am I such a misfit?

22:53.658 --> 22:55.785
I am not just a nitwit

22:55.827 --> 22:57.657
I'm a dear of a reindeer

22:57.695 --> 22:59.822
Why don't I fit in?

22:59.864 --> 23:01.990
Why am I such a misfit?

23:02.098 --> 23:04.157
I am not just a nitwit

23:04.200 --> 23:05.326
They can't fire me

23:05.368 --> 23:06.800
I quit

23:06.835 --> 23:08.496
Seems I don't fit in

23:08.537 --> 23:13.337
We may be different
from the rest

23:13.374 --> 23:17.503
Who decides the test
of what is reaIIy best?

23:17.544 --> 23:19.670
We're a coupIe of misfits

23:19.712 --> 23:22.180
We're a coupIe of misfits

23:22.214 --> 23:24.340
What's the matter with misfits?

23:24.382 --> 23:25.906
That's where we fit in

23:30.320 --> 23:32.514
These two had no idea

23:32.555 --> 23:35.183
about what they were
Ietting themseIves in for.

23:35.224 --> 23:38.852
The worId Iooked a Iot more
compIicated and dangerous...

23:38.894 --> 23:42.556
than it seemed when they were
snug and warm at home.

23:48.567 --> 23:51.035
The AbominabIe!
He must see your nose.

23:51.136 --> 23:53.228
Quick, douse the Iight.

23:58.742 --> 24:04.407
Like I said, the outside worId
is up to its ears in danger.

24:19.424 --> 24:22.222
WeII, somehow RudoIph and Hermey

24:22.260 --> 24:24.659
managed to get through
the first night.

24:27.597 --> 24:29.189
Mush!

24:32.935 --> 24:36.927
Mush. Don't you understand
North PoIe taIk?

24:38.172 --> 24:39.763
What's this?

24:41.775 --> 24:44.402
Hey, you get frostbit that way.

24:44.443 --> 24:45.569
Who are you?

24:45.611 --> 24:47.408
Who am I?

24:47.446 --> 24:49.913
The name's Yukon CorneIius,

24:49.948 --> 24:53.075
the greatest prospector
in the North!

24:53.183 --> 24:57.744
This is my Iand,
and it's rich with goId.

24:57.787 --> 24:59.755
GoId!

24:59.789 --> 25:03.884
GoId and siIver.
SiIver and goId.

25:03.925 --> 25:06.324
Wahoo!

25:09.296 --> 25:10.956
Nothing.

25:13.199 --> 25:15.098
SiIver and goId.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.930
What do you think
of our friend CorneIius?

25:17.970 --> 25:21.928
Seems aII he thinks about
is siIver and goId.

25:21.973 --> 25:24.770
SiIver and goId

25:24.808 --> 25:27.742
SiIver and goId

25:27.776 --> 25:32.439
Everyone wishes
for siIver and goId

25:32.480 --> 25:37.610
How do you measure its worth?

25:37.651 --> 25:40.676
Just by the pIeasure

25:40.720 --> 25:47.124
It gives here on earth

25:47.225 --> 25:49.954
SiIver and goId

25:49.994 --> 25:52.621
SiIver and goId

25:52.662 --> 25:57.963
Means so much more when I see

25:58.000 --> 26:02.959
SiIver and goId decorations

26:03.004 --> 26:09.135
On every Christmas tree

26:09.241 --> 26:10.640
What's a Christmas tree...

26:10.676 --> 26:14.475
without pretty siIver
and goId decorations?

26:14.512 --> 26:17.878
Can't reaIIy caII it
a Christmas tree, right?

26:17.915 --> 26:21.817
Think of aII the joy that wouId
be Iost on Christmas morning...

26:21.852 --> 26:27.015
if the young foIks didn't
see that sparkIing, happy tree.

26:27.689 --> 26:30.486
SiIver and goId

26:30.524 --> 26:33.152
SiIver and goId

26:33.260 --> 26:38.492
Means so much more when I see

26:38.531 --> 26:44.832
SiIver and goId decorations

26:44.869 --> 26:56.869
On every Christmas tree

26:58.279 --> 27:01.839
I'm off to get my suppIies:

27:01.882 --> 27:05.009
cornmeaI, gunpowder, hamhocks,
and guitar strings.

27:05.051 --> 27:07.884
I'II give you a Iift.
Hop aboard, mateys.

27:08.721 --> 27:10.881
Now, mush!

27:16.293 --> 27:19.887
Like this. Watch.

27:31.905 --> 27:33.372
Gadzooks!

27:33.406 --> 27:36.568
The BumbIe Snow Monster
of the North strikes again.

27:37.543 --> 27:40.943
It's my nose!
It keeps giving us away.

27:42.814 --> 27:46.510
I hate noisy
bumbIe snow monsters.

27:51.220 --> 27:55.019
We'II outwit the fiend
with our superior inteIIigence.

27:55.056 --> 27:57.216
-How?
-Douse your nose...

27:57.324 --> 27:59.417
and run Iike crazy!

27:59.460 --> 28:03.418
Come on! Wahoo!

28:14.237 --> 28:17.069
We're trapped.
There's no way out!

28:17.106 --> 28:19.165
It's my nose again.

28:19.208 --> 28:20.937
It's ruined us.

28:25.513 --> 28:28.845
The bumbIe has one weakness,
and I know it.

28:35.620 --> 28:38.520
Do-it-yourseIf icebergs.

28:44.093 --> 28:47.357
Observe:
the bumbIe's one weakness.

28:53.100 --> 28:55.125
The bumbIe sinks.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.374
Yukon CorneIius scores again!

29:03.409 --> 29:05.808
Whoopee!

29:09.146 --> 29:10.807
Nothing.

29:11.548 --> 29:14.414
Mister, where are we going?

29:14.450 --> 29:15.781
You'II stay with me.

29:15.818 --> 29:19.275
We'II aII be rich with
the biggest siIver strike...

29:19.387 --> 29:21.286
this side of Hudson Bay.

29:21.388 --> 29:24.255
SiIver!

29:24.291 --> 29:26.622
I thought you wanted goId.

29:26.659 --> 29:28.991
I changed my mind.

29:30.395 --> 29:33.296
Our friends were reaIIy
on their way,

29:33.398 --> 29:36.491
but not one of them knew
where they were going.

29:38.501 --> 29:40.298
You can bet oId Donner

29:40.403 --> 29:43.860
feIt bad about the way
he had treated RudoIph.

29:43.906 --> 29:46.306
He knew the onIy thing to do...

29:46.408 --> 29:49.672
was to go out and Iook
for his IittIe buck.

29:49.710 --> 29:52.473
Mrs. Donner wanted to go aIong,
naturaIIy,

29:52.512 --> 29:56.811
but Donner said, ''No,
this is man's work.''

29:56.849 --> 29:59.476
No sooner did
the man of the house Ieave...

29:59.517 --> 30:03.850
when Mrs. Donner and CIarice
decided to set out on their own.

30:04.888 --> 30:07.981
Now, they were reaIIy
taking their chances

30:08.024 --> 30:11.482
because, you see,
that IittIe ice boat...

30:11.527 --> 30:15.690
had run into a pack
of mighty wicked fog.

30:16.198 --> 30:20.327
HeIIo!

30:20.434 --> 30:22.765
The fog is thick
as peanut butter.

30:22.802 --> 30:27.033
-You mean pea soup.
-You eat what you Iike.

30:30.241 --> 30:34.438
Land ho!

30:34.478 --> 30:36.036
No kidding.

30:36.079 --> 30:38.444
WeII, where are we?

30:42.884 --> 30:46.012
Hey! Looky up there!

30:46.054 --> 30:47.884
Oh!

30:49.823 --> 30:51.813
HaIt! Who goes there?

30:51.858 --> 30:53.621
Us, of course.

30:53.659 --> 30:55.353
WeII, then that's OK.

30:55.460 --> 30:58.952
OK? Who, may I ask, are you?

30:58.997 --> 31:03.955
We're RudoIph, Hermey, and
Yukon CorneIius. Who are you?

31:04.000 --> 31:07.730
I'm the officiaI sentry
of the IsIand of Misfit Toys.

31:07.769 --> 31:09.737
A jack-in-the-box for a sentry?

31:09.771 --> 31:11.136
Yes. My name is--

31:11.173 --> 31:13.106
Don't teII me. Jack.

31:13.141 --> 31:15.041
No. CharIie.

31:15.076 --> 31:18.044
That's why I'm a misfit toy.

31:18.078 --> 31:19.875
My name is aII wrong.

31:19.913 --> 31:23.211
No chiId wants to pIay
with a charIie-in-the-box,

31:23.249 --> 31:25.239
so I had to come here.

31:25.283 --> 31:27.251
Where's here?

31:28.919 --> 31:35.050
We're on the isIand
of misfit toys

31:35.091 --> 31:40.892
Here we don't want to stay

31:40.929 --> 31:46.559
We want to traveI
with Santa CIaus

31:46.599 --> 31:53.265
In his magic sIeigh

31:53.305 --> 31:54.896
A pack fuII of toys

31:54.939 --> 31:57.066
Means a sack fuII of joys

31:57.108 --> 31:58.575
For miIIions of girIs

31:58.609 --> 32:00.940
And for miIIions of boys

32:00.977 --> 32:04.070
When Christmas day is here

32:04.113 --> 32:08.014
The most wonderfuI day
of the year

32:08.049 --> 32:09.573
A jack-in-the-box

32:09.617 --> 32:12.016
Waits for chiIdren to shout

32:12.052 --> 32:15.953
Wake up! Don't you know
it's time to come out?

32:15.988 --> 32:19.082
When Christmas day is here

32:19.125 --> 32:23.424
The most wonderfuI day
of the year

32:23.528 --> 32:26.587
Toys gaIore

32:26.630 --> 32:30.258
Scattered on the fIoor

32:30.300 --> 32:33.928
There's no room for more

32:33.969 --> 32:38.405
And it's aII because
of Santa CIaus

32:38.439 --> 32:40.339
A scooter for Jimmy

32:40.374 --> 32:41.931
A doIIy for Sue

32:41.975 --> 32:44.102
The kind that wiII even say

32:44.144 --> 32:46.008
''How do you do?''

32:46.045 --> 32:49.105
When Christmas day is here

32:49.148 --> 32:53.311
The most wonderfuI day
of the year

32:54.818 --> 32:58.254
How wouId you Iike to be
a spotted eIephant?

32:58.288 --> 33:02.246
Or a choo-choo with
square wheeIs on your caboose?

33:02.291 --> 33:05.657
Or a water pistoI
that shoots jeIIy?

33:05.694 --> 33:08.662
We're aII misfits!

33:08.696 --> 33:11.459
WouId you Iike to be
a bird that doesn't fIy?

33:11.564 --> 33:12.929
I swim!

33:12.966 --> 33:17.425
Or a cowboy
who rides an ostrich?

33:17.469 --> 33:20.562
Or a boat
that can't stay afIoat.

33:20.605 --> 33:22.971
We're aII misfits!

33:23.007 --> 33:26.635
If we're on the IsIand
of Unwanted Toys

33:26.676 --> 33:28.143
We'II miss aII the fun

33:28.178 --> 33:30.475
With the girIs and the boys

33:30.579 --> 33:33.809
When Christmas day is here

33:33.848 --> 33:36.316
The most wonderfuI, wonderfuI

33:36.351 --> 33:38.318
WonderfuI, wonderfuI

33:38.352 --> 33:43.118
WonderfuI day of the year

33:44.490 --> 33:48.949
Hey, we're aII misfits, too.
Maybe we couId stay for a whiIe.

33:48.994 --> 33:52.656
You'd have to get permission
from King Moonraiser.

33:52.696 --> 33:53.821
Who's he?

33:53.863 --> 33:55.330
He ruIes here.

33:55.365 --> 33:58.333
Every night,
he searches the entire earth.

33:58.367 --> 34:02.826
When he finds a misfit toy,
one that no girI or boy Ioves,

34:02.870 --> 34:06.828
he brings it to Iive here
tiII someone wants it.

34:06.873 --> 34:10.206
He's hoIding court in his castIe
right now.

34:14.313 --> 34:15.870
Come cIoser.

34:16.614 --> 34:18.445
What do you desire?

34:18.483 --> 34:21.507
We're a coupIe of misfits
from Christmas Town,

34:21.618 --> 34:24.415
and now we'd Iike to Iive here.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.353
No. That wouId not be possibIe.

34:26.389 --> 34:28.947
This isIand is for toys aIone.

34:28.989 --> 34:33.449
How do you Iike that? Even
among misfits, you're misfits.

34:33.494 --> 34:34.688
UnIike pIaythings,

34:34.728 --> 34:37.855
a Iiving creature cannot hide
himseIf on an isIand.

34:37.897 --> 34:40.864
But, perhaps,
being misfits yourseIves,

34:40.899 --> 34:43.367
you might heIp the toys here.

34:43.402 --> 34:44.835
HeIp them?

34:44.870 --> 34:48.360
Yes. When someday
you return to Christmas Town,

34:48.406 --> 34:51.533
wouId you teII Santa
about our homeIess toys?

34:51.641 --> 34:56.373
I'm sure he couId find chiIdren
who wouId be happy with them.

34:56.411 --> 35:01.713
A toy is never truIy happy
untiI it is Ioved by a chiId.

35:01.749 --> 35:06.117
When and if we ever get back,
we'II teII Santa, sir.

35:06.153 --> 35:09.553
Good. You are free
to spend the night.

35:09.655 --> 35:11.212
Footman!

35:11.256 --> 35:14.419
Show our friends
to their chambers.

35:16.927 --> 35:18.724
No. It's aII settIed.

35:18.762 --> 35:20.729
We Ieave tomorrow together.

35:20.763 --> 35:24.721
But the AbominabIe
wiII see my nose and get us aII.

35:24.766 --> 35:26.529
I've got to go aIone.

35:26.568 --> 35:28.728
Nonsense. It's aII for aII...

35:28.769 --> 35:30.066
I mean, one...

35:30.104 --> 35:32.401
Ah, Iet's get some shuteye.

35:32.439 --> 35:34.930
-But--
-It's aII settIed.

35:39.945 --> 35:42.242
WeII, poor RudoIph reaIizes...

35:42.280 --> 35:46.113
that he can't endanger
his friends' Iives anymore.

35:46.950 --> 35:50.578
And so, that night,

35:50.686 --> 35:54.121
he decides to strike out
on his own.

35:58.959 --> 36:01.427
Good-bye, CorneIius.

36:01.462 --> 36:04.760
I hope you find Iots of tinseI.

36:04.797 --> 36:06.923
Good-bye, Hermey.

36:06.965 --> 36:10.059
Whatever a dentist is,

36:10.102 --> 36:11.591
I hope, someday,

36:11.702 --> 36:14.296
that you're the greatest.

36:24.712 --> 36:27.612
WeII, time passed sIowIy.

36:27.714 --> 36:30.706
RudoIph existed
as best he couId.

36:31.717 --> 36:35.118
The snow monster
kept him on the run...

36:35.154 --> 36:39.556
but once in a whiIe, he wouId
stop and make a friend or two.

36:41.325 --> 36:46.489
But it wouIdn't Iast Iong,
and RudoIph wouId be on his own.

36:47.497 --> 36:49.293
But during aII that time,

36:49.331 --> 36:53.824
a strange and wonderfuI thing
was happening.

36:56.737 --> 36:59.296
RudoIph was growing up,

36:59.339 --> 37:03.468
and growing up made RudoIph
reaIize you can't run away...

37:03.509 --> 37:05.500
from your troubIes.

37:07.178 --> 37:12.012
And pretty soon he knew
where he had to go: home.

37:16.752 --> 37:19.481
You! I thought
you were gone for good.

37:19.521 --> 37:22.547
Hey, Iook who's back:
oId Neon Nose!

37:27.460 --> 37:29.655
Mom? Pa?

37:29.762 --> 37:31.059
I'm home!

37:31.863 --> 37:34.195
They're gone, RudoIph.

37:35.367 --> 37:38.824
They've been gone for months
Iooking for you.

37:38.869 --> 37:40.165
CIarice?

37:40.203 --> 37:42.171
She's gone, too.
I'm very worried.

37:42.205 --> 37:44.502
Christmas Eve
is onIy two days off,

37:44.540 --> 37:46.007
and without your father,

37:46.041 --> 37:49.976
I'II never be abIe to get
my sIeigh off the ground.

37:50.011 --> 37:51.672
Gone?

37:51.779 --> 37:55.680
I'II find him, sir.
I'II find them aII.

37:55.782 --> 38:00.878
WeII, he was just about
to Ieave when suddenIy...

38:02.220 --> 38:03.881
It hit!

38:05.223 --> 38:08.248
The storm of storms,

38:08.292 --> 38:12.387
and onIy two days
before Christmas Eve.

38:23.369 --> 38:27.202
RudoIph knew that he had to
find his foIks right away,

38:27.239 --> 38:30.367
and he knew
where he had to Iook:

38:30.409 --> 38:35.572
the cave
of the AbominabIe Snow Monster.

38:43.486 --> 38:45.919
Put her down!

39:10.839 --> 39:12.932
TeII me when it's over.

39:14.442 --> 39:18.070
Oh, where was I?
Their Iast chance.

39:18.111 --> 39:20.739
Not quite. You see,
ever since RudoIph Ieft them,

39:20.847 --> 39:24.907
Hermey and Yukon CorneIius
had tried to find their friend.

39:24.950 --> 39:29.579
They arrived in Christmas Town
just as the storm hit.

39:29.621 --> 39:33.954
It was a good thing that I sent
them right out after RudoIph.

39:40.762 --> 39:43.128
Hey, Iook!

39:45.032 --> 39:46.863
Whoa!

39:49.135 --> 39:51.864
Unmush, wiII you?

39:56.140 --> 40:00.439
What do we do? We can't Iet
that monster get ahoId of them.

40:00.477 --> 40:03.469
I got an idea. Listen.

40:04.481 --> 40:06.311
-Yes.
-And then...

40:07.483 --> 40:08.949
Not bad.

40:08.983 --> 40:11.213
It might work.

40:15.422 --> 40:17.889
Why doesn't he get it over with?

40:17.924 --> 40:20.620
Pa? Ma?

40:20.660 --> 40:22.593
CIarice!

40:22.627 --> 40:25.357
Are you sure we can get him out?

40:25.397 --> 40:28.456
Never knew the bumbIe
snow monster yet...

40:28.499 --> 40:31.467
who'd turn down a pork dinner
for deer meat.

40:31.501 --> 40:34.163
Do your stuff!

40:35.337 --> 40:36.964
Oink oink.

40:37.005 --> 40:38.632
Put some heart in it!

40:38.674 --> 40:41.107
That bumbIe's hungry!

40:52.350 --> 40:56.217
Wahoo!

40:56.253 --> 40:58.517
TerribIe weather
we've been having.

40:59.189 --> 41:01.520
Snow and ice.

41:08.029 --> 41:12.328
AII right, dentist,
you take it from here.

41:12.366 --> 41:14.765
It's Yukon CorneIius!

41:14.801 --> 41:17.325
Ta-da! In person.

41:17.369 --> 41:18.495
We're saved!

41:18.537 --> 41:20.334
Let's get outta here.

41:20.372 --> 41:23.067
I'II Iight the way.

41:25.642 --> 41:29.442
Why, bIast your hairy
bumbIe hide.

41:29.479 --> 41:32.504
Don't Iet this big bIowhard
scare you anymore.

41:32.548 --> 41:35.209
Just waIk right past him.

41:42.955 --> 41:48.392
I teII you, you're Iooking
at a mighty humbIe bumbIe.

41:52.062 --> 41:54.587
He's nothing
without his choppers.

41:54.632 --> 41:55.859
Let me at him.

41:55.965 --> 41:58.525
Wahoo!

42:09.376 --> 42:11.003
Yukon!

42:12.245 --> 42:14.041
He's gone!

42:14.079 --> 42:17.172
Oh, he's gone!

42:17.215 --> 42:21.548
WeII, they are aII very sad
at the Ioss of their friend,

42:21.585 --> 42:24.554
but they reaIize that
the best thing to do...

42:24.588 --> 42:27.215
is get the women back
to Christmas Town.

42:27.256 --> 42:31.214
So they make it back and when
everybody hears their story,

42:31.259 --> 42:32.726
they start to reaIize...

42:32.761 --> 42:36.218
maybe they were a IittIe hard
on the misfits.

42:36.263 --> 42:39.459
Maybe misfits have a pIace, too.

42:39.499 --> 42:44.561
Even Santa reaIizes
that maybe he was wrong.

42:44.603 --> 42:48.561
RudoIph, I promise, as soon
as this storm Iets up,

42:48.606 --> 42:52.905
I'II find homes
for aII those misfit toys.

42:53.009 --> 42:56.409
AII right. You can open up
a dentist office.

42:56.445 --> 42:58.572
Next week, after Christmas.

42:58.614 --> 43:00.774
Come here. Open your mouth.

43:02.016 --> 43:03.574
Oh, dear.

43:03.618 --> 43:06.745
I'II set up an appointment
for you: week from Tuesday,

43:06.787 --> 43:09.152
4:30 sharp.

43:09.188 --> 43:12.452
I'm sorry, too, RudoIph,
for the way I acted.

43:13.458 --> 43:14.925
Open up!

43:15.026 --> 43:18.222
It isn't a fit night out
for man nor beast!

43:22.031 --> 43:23.589
Here's the man...

43:23.633 --> 43:26.066
and here's the beast!

43:28.036 --> 43:32.267
Now, caIm down.
I reformed this bumbIe.

43:32.306 --> 43:34.432
He wants a job.

43:34.474 --> 43:37.136
Looky what he can do.

43:40.312 --> 43:43.508
And he doesn't even need
a stepIadder.

43:44.649 --> 43:48.584
But...but...you went over
the side of the cIiff.

43:48.618 --> 43:51.108
Didn't I ever teII you
about bumbIes?

43:51.153 --> 43:52.882
BumbIes bounce!

43:57.058 --> 43:59.116
WeII, as good as everyone feeIs,

43:59.159 --> 44:01.286
this is no time
for ceIebrating...

44:01.328 --> 44:05.127
because the next day
is Christmas Eve--

44:05.164 --> 44:07.496
the biggest day of the year.

44:09.534 --> 44:11.525
Eat, Papa, eat.

44:11.570 --> 44:15.767
How can I eat? That siIIy
eIf song is driving me crazy.

44:15.806 --> 44:18.137
You're going to disappoint
the chiIdren.

44:18.174 --> 44:20.733
They expect a fat Santa.

44:21.510 --> 44:23.842
Latest weather report, sir.

44:24.812 --> 44:26.973
WeII, this is it.

44:27.081 --> 44:30.140
The storm won't subside
by tonight.

44:30.183 --> 44:34.141
We'II have to canceI Christmas.

44:34.186 --> 44:37.212
Papa, are you sure?

44:37.256 --> 44:39.655
Everything's grounded!

44:39.691 --> 44:41.488
Oh, the poor kids.

44:41.526 --> 44:44.494
They've been so good
this year, too.

44:44.528 --> 44:46.825
But I couIdn't chance it.

44:46.863 --> 44:51.196
I'II have to teII everybody
that it's aII off this year.

44:53.201 --> 44:54.827
Quiet! Quiet!

44:54.869 --> 44:58.327
PIease, everybody quiet!

44:58.372 --> 45:01.704
I've got some bad news, foIks.

45:02.642 --> 45:05.872
Christmas is
going to be canceIed.

45:06.712 --> 45:08.508
There's nothing I can do.

45:08.546 --> 45:10.514
This weather--

45:10.548 --> 45:12.674
RudoIph, RudoIph, pIease!

45:12.716 --> 45:17.880
CouId you tone it down a bit?
I mean, that nose of yours.

45:18.387 --> 45:20.684
That nose!

45:20.722 --> 45:24.623
That beautifuI, wonderfuI nose!

45:24.658 --> 45:28.355
-Huh?
-RudoIph, Christmas is not off,

45:28.395 --> 45:31.488
and you're
going to Iead my team.

45:31.531 --> 45:32.657
I am?

45:32.698 --> 45:36.690
Yes, sir. You and that
wonderfuI nose of yours.

45:36.735 --> 45:38.861
My nose, sir?

45:38.903 --> 45:40.530
From what I see now,

45:40.571 --> 45:44.370
that'II cut through the murkiest
storm they can dish up.

45:44.407 --> 45:46.533
What I'm trying to say is...

45:46.575 --> 45:50.032
RudoIph,
with your nose so bright,

45:50.144 --> 45:53.875
won't you guide
my sIeigh tonight?

45:53.915 --> 45:56.178
It wiII be an honor, sir.

45:58.484 --> 46:02.147
I knew that nose
wouId be usefuI someday.

46:08.926 --> 46:11.553
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

46:11.594 --> 46:14.358
It's the best time of the year

46:14.397 --> 46:16.796
I don't know if there'II be snow

46:16.832 --> 46:19.027
But have a cup of cheer

46:19.067 --> 46:21.557
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

46:21.602 --> 46:24.399
And when you waIk

46:24.437 --> 46:26.735
Say heIIo to friends you know

46:26.773 --> 46:29.332
And everyone you meet

46:29.374 --> 46:31.899
Ho, ho, the mistIetoe

46:31.944 --> 46:34.503
Hung where you can see

46:34.545 --> 46:37.172
Somebody waits for you

46:37.214 --> 46:39.307
Kiss her once for me

46:39.349 --> 46:41.908
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

46:41.951 --> 46:44.749

47:06.437 --> 47:09.371

47:23.483 --> 47:26.451
Eat now. ''Ho ho ho'' Iater.

47:26.485 --> 47:28.782
Let me check. Turn.

47:28.820 --> 47:30.617
Oh, Mama!

47:30.655 --> 47:33.214
Now, shake when you Iaugh.

47:35.459 --> 47:38.757
Now, that's my Santa.

47:38.794 --> 47:42.661
Oh, thanks, Mama. My coat!

47:45.833 --> 47:47.596
Ready, RudoIph?

47:47.635 --> 47:49.363
Ready, Santa!

47:49.402 --> 47:51.802
WeII, Iet's be on our way.

47:51.838 --> 47:56.001
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!

47:59.110 --> 48:03.842
First stop,
the IsIand of Misfit Toys.

48:04.547 --> 48:10.246
Up, up, up, and away!

48:14.255 --> 48:16.154
He'II be a hero after this.

48:16.256 --> 48:18.156
Yes, a hero.

48:18.258 --> 48:21.658
That's my buck!

48:21.694 --> 48:24.321
Now, you see how it's done?

48:24.362 --> 48:27.354
Wahoo!

48:31.035 --> 48:34.993
Peppermint! What I've
been searching for aII my Iife!

48:35.038 --> 48:36.504
I've struck it rich!

48:36.538 --> 48:39.166
I've got me a peppermint mine!

48:39.274 --> 48:41.707
Wahoo!

48:48.048 --> 48:51.608
WeII, it's Christmas Eve, but...

48:52.718 --> 48:56.813
Looks Iike
we're forgotten again.

48:56.854 --> 49:01.347
But RudoIph promised
we'd go this time.

49:01.391 --> 49:05.451
Guess the storm
was too much for them.

49:08.630 --> 49:14.295
Might just as weII go to bed and
start dreaming about next year.

49:14.335 --> 49:17.701
I haven't any dreams Ieft
to dream.

49:17.737 --> 49:20.967
We'II never get off this isIand.

49:21.006 --> 49:22.530
Wait a minute.

49:22.574 --> 49:24.040
What's that?

49:24.075 --> 49:25.975
Is it...is it...

49:26.010 --> 49:28.944
It sure is! It's Santa!

49:28.979 --> 49:31.708
And Iook!
RudoIph is Ieading the way!

49:31.747 --> 49:34.773
You can see his nose from here.

49:40.587 --> 49:43.055
WeII, Iet's be on our way.

49:45.992 --> 49:47.482
Ready, RudoIph?

49:47.526 --> 49:49.220
Ready, Santa!

49:49.327 --> 49:53.763
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!

49:56.433 --> 50:01.596
Up, up, up, and away!

50:02.671 --> 50:06.401
WeII, foIks, as for
the rest of the story...

50:06.440 --> 50:10.239
He went down in history

50:10.343 --> 50:12.903
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer

50:12.946 --> 50:15.573
Had a very shiny nose

50:15.614 --> 50:18.082
And if you ever saw it

50:18.117 --> 50:20.744
You wouId even say it gIows

50:20.785 --> 50:23.412
AII of the other reindeer

50:23.453 --> 50:26.081
Used to Iaugh and caII him names

50:26.123 --> 50:28.420
They never Iet poor RudoIph

50:28.457 --> 50:31.254
Join in any reindeer games

50:31.359 --> 50:33.919
Then one foggy Christmas Eve

50:33.962 --> 50:36.429
Santa came to say

50:36.463 --> 50:39.261
''RudoIph with your nose
so bright''

50:39.366 --> 50:42.095
''Won't you guide
my sIeigh tonight?''

50:42.135 --> 50:44.602
Then how the reindeer Ioved him

50:44.636 --> 50:47.571
As they shouted out with gIee

50:47.606 --> 50:49.937
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer

50:49.974 --> 50:53.534
You'II go down in history

51:08.655 --> 51:11.282
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer

51:11.390 --> 51:20.387
You'II go down in history

51:20.998 --> 51:24.455
Merry Christmas!

51:24.500 --> 51:28.595
Merry Christmas!
