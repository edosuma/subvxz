00:00.499 --> 00:01.998
<i>- My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:01.999 --> 00:04.998
<i>and I graduated from one of</i>
<i>Canada's top business schools</i>

00:04.999 --> 00:06.998
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:06.999 --> 00:08.998
<i>Now I'm using my knowledge</i>
<i>to help struggling</i>

00:08.999 --> 00:13.998
<i>small-business owners make it</i>
<i>in this competitive world.</i>

00:13.999 --> 00:14.998
This...

00:14.999 --> 00:17.998
is "Nathan For You."

00:17.999 --> 00:18.998
<i>For most women,</i>

00:18.999 --> 00:20.998
<i>nails are the main way</i>
<i>they can express to others</i>

00:20.999 --> 00:22.998
<i>what color they like the most,</i>

00:22.999 --> 00:25.998
<i>which is why, in the town</i>
<i>of Altadena, California,</i>

00:25.999 --> 00:27.998
<i>there's a nail salon</i>
<i>on nearly every corner,</i>

00:27.999 --> 00:28.998
<i>and this competition</i>

00:28.999 --> 00:31.998
<i>has left Kim Han,</i>
<i>owner of Corner Beauty Nails,</i>

00:31.999 --> 00:32.998
<i>desperate to stand out.</i>

00:32.999 --> 00:36.998
- I always try to be different
from other nail salon

00:36.999 --> 00:37.998
to make my customer happy.

00:37.999 --> 00:40.998
<i>- Because I'm unfamiliar</i>
<i>with the nail-salon experience,</i>

00:40.999 --> 00:42.998
<i>I decided to visit</i>
<i>Corner Beauty</i>

00:42.999 --> 00:46.998
<i>undercover as a gorgeous woman</i>
<i>looking to get a manicure.</i>

00:46.999 --> 00:49.998
<i>You may have expected me</i>
<i>to wear a dress or long hair,</i>

00:49.999 --> 00:51.999
<i>but I believe a modern woman</i>
<i>can present herself</i>

00:52.800 --> 00:53.998
<i>however she likes,</i>

00:53.999 --> 00:55.999
<i>And once inside,</i>
<i>I was able to get a sense</i>

00:56.999 --> 00:58.998
<i>of the female experience</i>
<i>at the salon.</i>

00:58.999 --> 01:00.998
Oh, this one's gorgeous.
- Yes.

01:00.999 --> 01:01.998
- That's lovely.
- Yes.

01:01.999 --> 01:03.998
<i>- After 20 minutes</i>
<i>of being there,</i>

01:03.999 --> 01:06.998
<i>I hadn't seen any issues with</i>
<i>their offerings or services.</i>

01:06.999 --> 01:08.999
<i>But after,</i>
<i>while digging through my purse</i>

01:09.120 --> 01:10.998
<i>to find my car keys,</i>

01:10.999 --> 01:13.998
<i>I discovered that I completely</i>
<i>ruined my nail job.</i>

01:13.999 --> 01:15.998
<i>And later that week,</i>
<i>when I finally met Kim,</i>

01:15.999 --> 01:18.998
<i>she agreed that it was</i>
<i>a problem for her business.</i>

01:18.999 --> 01:19.998
- They lose something.

01:19.999 --> 01:21.998
They looking for the key,
or they hit the door.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.998
Anything can happen
when the nail wet.

01:23.999 --> 01:25.760
- And then
you have to fix it.

01:25.999 --> 01:26.998
- I have to fix it for free.

01:26.999 --> 01:29.998
<i>- But customers would never</i>
<i>have to dig for their keys</i>

01:29.999 --> 01:30.998
<i>and ruin their nails again</i>

01:30.999 --> 01:34.998
<i>if Corner Beauty</i>
<i>offered a free valet.</i>

01:34.999 --> 01:36.998
- I don't know.
Good idea or not. I don't know.

01:36.999 --> 01:38.998
- I mean, I know I'm a bit
of a fish out of water

01:38.999 --> 01:40.999
when it comes to this stuff
because I'm not a woman.

01:41.999 --> 01:42.998
- Mm-hmm.

01:42.999 --> 01:44.999
- But you should know
I was raised a feminist,

01:45.240 --> 01:48.998
and I have a very strong
female side to me.

01:48.999 --> 01:53.998
So, even though on the outside
I appear masculine and rugged,

01:53.999 --> 01:57.998
on the inside, you know,
I feel like I can relate to you.

01:57.999 --> 01:58.999
- Good.
That's good.

01:59.999 --> 02:02.998
<i>- Kim liked my valet idea,</i>
<i>but to save on staffing costs,</i>

02:02.999 --> 02:04.998
<i>she suggested</i>
<i>I use her current employees</i>

02:04.999 --> 02:06.998
<i>when they had downtime</i>
<i>in between clients.</i>

02:06.999 --> 02:08.997
<i>So, after she pitched it</i>
<i>to her staff</i>

02:08.999 --> 02:10.997
<i>and they seemed interested,</i>

02:10.999 --> 02:12.998
<i>I brought them out back</i>
<i>to prep them for the job.</i>

02:12.999 --> 02:16.999
So, who here has operated
a valet stand before?

02:19.999 --> 02:20.998
Okay, no problem.

02:20.999 --> 02:22.998
It's really easy.

02:22.999 --> 02:23.999
First rule of valet is,

02:24.999 --> 02:26.998
you got to know
how to catch keys,

02:26.999 --> 02:28.998
'cause people
are gonna park their car,

02:28.999 --> 02:29.998
and they're gonna throw
their keys at you.

02:29.999 --> 02:32.998
And you never know
when they're gonna come.

02:32.999 --> 02:33.998
Good.

02:33.999 --> 02:35.998
<i>After practicing a variety</i>

02:35.999 --> 02:37.998
<i>of key-catching methods</i>
<i>with the staff...</i>

02:37.999 --> 02:38.998
If it's a pop fly,

02:38.999 --> 02:41.998
one person's
got to call it, okay?

02:41.999 --> 02:42.998
- Mine.

02:42.999 --> 02:46.998
- Call it before it--
before it lands, yeah.

02:46.999 --> 02:48.998
<i>I felt like they now</i>
<i>had all the skills they needed</i>

02:48.999 --> 02:49.998
<i>to run a valet.</i>

02:49.999 --> 02:51.998
Yeah.

02:51.999 --> 02:53.999
[humming rock music]

02:55.999 --> 02:57.440
You know, guitar?
all: Yes.

02:57.999 --> 02:58.998
- You guys play?
- No, no, we don't.

02:58.999 --> 03:00.998
- No.
Yeah, I don't either.

03:00.999 --> 03:03.998
<i>With the training complete,</i>
<i>we were ready to get started.</i>

03:03.999 --> 03:05.998
<i>So, the next day, after setting</i>
<i>up our valet stand</i>

03:05.999 --> 03:07.998
<i>and outfitting the staff,</i>

03:07.999 --> 03:10.998
<i>it was time to offer</i>
<i>our new service to customers.</i>

03:10.999 --> 03:11.998
Hey, welcome.

03:11.999 --> 03:13.998
So we're offering
free valet today.

03:13.999 --> 03:15.998
So, after
you're done, you know,

03:15.999 --> 03:17.998
you don't have to be going
through your purse

03:17.999 --> 03:19.998
and ruining your nails
trying to find your keys.

03:19.999 --> 03:20.998
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

03:20.999 --> 03:22.998
<i>The customers</i>
<i>seemed to love the idea,</i>

03:22.999 --> 03:23.998
<i>but I sensed some hesitation</i>

03:23.999 --> 03:26.998
<i>when I presented Tina</i>
<i>as the valet driver.</i>

03:26.999 --> 03:29.400
- Um, well, whomever.

03:29.999 --> 03:31.998
Who usually does it?

03:31.999 --> 03:34.998
- They're the valet.
- Okay, then let them park.

03:34.999 --> 03:36.998
<i>- At first, I just figured</i>
<i>it was people's surprise</i>

03:36.999 --> 03:39.998
<i>at seeing a valet run</i>
<i>by nail technicians.</i>

03:39.999 --> 03:42.998
- Why would she be
parking my car?

03:42.999 --> 03:43.998
- She's doing the valet.
- Oh, okay.

03:43.999 --> 03:46.998
- Yeah.
- Okay.

03:46.999 --> 03:48.999
<i>- But then I realized</i>
<i>it might be something more.</i>

03:49.999 --> 03:51.998
- You have a driver's license?
- Yes.

03:51.999 --> 03:52.998
- Yeah, she's a--
she's a good driver.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.998
She has a license.
- Okay. All right, thank you.

03:55.999 --> 03:58.999
<i>- And later, when I talked</i>
<i>to Tina, she seemed to agree.</i>

04:01.999 --> 04:03.998
They think that?

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
<i>That's when I realized</i>
<i>the disturbing truth.</i>

04:06.999 --> 04:08.998
<i>These customers</i>
<i>seemed to be influenced</i>

04:08.999 --> 04:10.998
<i>by a common</i>
<i>but misguided stereotype</i>

04:10.999 --> 04:12.998
<i>that Asians are bad drivers.</i>

04:12.999 --> 04:14.998
<i>If this valet</i>
<i>was going to work,</i>

04:14.999 --> 04:16.998
<i>it became clear</i>
<i>I would have to do something</i>

04:16.999 --> 04:19.998
<i>to change these customer's</i>
<i>long-held beliefs.</i>

04:19.999 --> 04:22.998
<i>So I went online</i>
<i>and found an Asian stunt driver</i>

04:22.999 --> 04:23.998
<i>named Verena Mei,</i>

04:23.999 --> 04:26.000
<i>who could do some pretty</i>
<i>impressive stuff with a car,</i>

04:26.999 --> 04:27.998
<i>and I felt that</i>
<i>if she could stand in</i>

04:27.999 --> 04:29.998
<i>as one of our valets,</i>

04:29.999 --> 04:31.998
<i>customers</i>
<i>would finally see the truth</i>

04:31.999 --> 04:33.998
<i>about what Asians</i>
<i>can do behind the wheel.</i>

04:33.999 --> 04:36.998
So I'm working with a nail salon
whose customers

04:36.999 --> 04:39.998
are, unfortunately,
a bit behind the times

04:39.999 --> 04:42.998
when it comes to their thoughts
about Asian drivers.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.998
- Okay, got it.
- You know what I mean?

04:44.999 --> 04:46.998
- I got it--
all the stereotypical stuff.

04:46.999 --> 04:48.998
- You've heard all that,
I'm sure.

04:48.999 --> 04:49.998
- Absolutely. Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:49.999 --> 04:52.998
So I figure if they saw someone
who wasn't only a good driver,

04:52.999 --> 04:54.998
but the best in the world,

04:54.999 --> 04:58.998
they'd be forced to permanently
change their ideas

04:58.999 --> 05:00.998
about Asian drivers.

05:00.999 --> 05:01.998
- Okay.

05:01.999 --> 05:02.998
- Do you think
you could help do this?

05:02.999 --> 05:05.998
- Absolutely.
I would love to do it.

05:05.999 --> 05:09.998
- The only thing
is the staff at the salon,

05:09.999 --> 05:11.999
they all have very thick
Asian accents.

05:12.999 --> 05:13.998
- Okay.

05:13.999 --> 05:14.998
- And I noticed you don't,

05:14.999 --> 05:15.999
and I don't want any of the
customers there

05:16.999 --> 05:17.998
thinking, you know,
you're a plant, you know?

05:17.999 --> 05:19.998
- Yeah.

05:19.999 --> 05:23.998
- So would you be able
to maybe put on an accent?

05:23.999 --> 05:24.998
- Asian accent? Um...
- And then--

05:24.999 --> 05:27.998
- I could try,
but I don't really

05:27.999 --> 05:31.998
want to be, like,
a stereotypical one, but...

05:31.999 --> 05:34.998
For example,
what do you want me to say?

05:34.999 --> 05:36.998
- You want me to show you?
- Yeah.

05:36.999 --> 05:38.998
- I mean...

05:38.999 --> 05:40.998
I'm not totally comfortable
doing that.

05:40.999 --> 05:42.998
That's not offensive
if I do it, is it?

05:42.999 --> 05:44.998
- I don't think so, but...

05:44.999 --> 05:47.998
- Okay, I mean, I'm trying
to counteract stereotypes.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.998
The last thing I want to be
is--do something racist.

05:49.999 --> 05:50.999
- Yeah.

05:51.760 --> 05:52.998
- I just wanted
to make sure that--

05:52.999 --> 05:53.999
I'm just
showing you the voice,

05:54.999 --> 05:58.998
but I'm not, like, saying
I'm necessarily right.

05:58.999 --> 06:00.998
It's just my idea...

06:00.999 --> 06:03.998
maybe, but I'm not--

06:03.999 --> 06:06.998
Like, I don't want to offend
or do anything...

06:06.999 --> 06:07.998
- Yeah.

06:07.999 --> 06:09.998
- Okay, I'm not the best
at this, but--

06:09.999 --> 06:10.998
- It's okay.

06:10.999 --> 06:12.998
- Maybe something like...

06:12.999 --> 06:13.998
[imitating Asian accent]
"Oh, would you like me

06:13.999 --> 06:15.999
to park your car?"

06:17.999 --> 06:19.998
Is that...

06:19.999 --> 06:21.998
Sound Asian or...?

06:21.999 --> 06:24.998
- It sounds a little Asian.

06:24.999 --> 06:25.998
Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:25.999 --> 06:27.998
<i>With Verena on board,</i>

06:27.999 --> 06:29.998
<i>the next day,</i>
<i>we returned to the salon,</i>

06:29.999 --> 06:30.998
<i>and I made sure to dress her</i>

06:30.999 --> 06:33.998
<i>to look identical</i>
<i>to the regular staff.</i>

06:33.999 --> 06:35.998
<i>When the first customer</i>
<i>arrived and saw her valet,</i>

06:35.999 --> 06:37.998
<i>I knew she was</i>
<i>probably nervous,</i>

06:37.999 --> 06:39.998
<i>but my hope was</i>
<i>that once she had finished up</i>

06:39.999 --> 06:41.080
<i>with her manicure,</i>

06:41.999 --> 06:43.998
<i>Verena would be able</i>
<i>to show her once and for all</i>

06:43.999 --> 06:46.998
<i>the truth</i>
<i>about Asian drivers.</i>

06:46.999 --> 06:48.998
So what do you do
for a living?

06:48.999 --> 06:49.998
- I work at Bloomingdale's.

06:49.999 --> 06:51.998
- Oh, okay. Wow.

06:51.999 --> 06:53.998
- And this is prom season,
so I'm selling lots of dresses.

06:53.999 --> 06:55.998
- Oh, wow.
Yeah, I bet.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.998
Lots of girls going to prom.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.998
- Yes.

06:59.999 --> 07:03.998
- Got to go to prom.
- [chuckles]

07:03.999 --> 07:04.998
Yep.

07:04.999 --> 07:07.998
[tires squeal]

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
[tires screeching]
Oh.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.998
[tires screeching]

07:14.999 --> 07:15.998
- Thought they
couldn't drive, huh?

07:15.999 --> 07:16.998
- Yeah.

07:16.999 --> 07:19.999
<i>- Right away I could see</i>
<i>a lifetime of prejudice melting</i>

07:20.999 --> 07:21.998
<i>out of her brain.</i>

07:21.999 --> 07:23.998
<i>And as more and more</i>
<i>Corner Beauty Spa regulars</i>

07:23.999 --> 07:25.998
<i>saw Verena in action...</i>

07:25.999 --> 07:27.998
[tires screeching]

07:27.999 --> 07:29.998
<i>I could tell</i>
<i>they would never be hesitant</i>

07:29.999 --> 07:32.998
<i>to use a valet run</i>
<i>by Asians again.</i>

07:32.999 --> 07:33.998
- Your car.

07:33.999 --> 07:35.998
<i>- So, with that,</i>
<i>I could now return to Kim</i>

07:35.999 --> 07:37.998
<i>confident that my solution</i>

07:37.999 --> 07:40.998
<i>to prevent women from chipping</i>
<i>their nails would work.</i>

07:40.999 --> 07:41.998
Worked pretty well, right?

07:41.999 --> 07:43.998
- I have to say,
you do a good job.

07:43.999 --> 07:46.998
- And I bet you didn't think,
as a man, I could've come up

07:46.999 --> 07:49.998
with something that would work
so well for women.

07:49.999 --> 07:52.998
- Maybe you feel
how the women feel.

07:52.999 --> 07:54.998
- And I know what women want.

07:54.999 --> 07:56.998
- Yeah. I think so.

07:56.999 --> 07:58.998
- Thank you for those words
of encouragement.

07:58.999 --> 08:00.560

08:00.999 --> 08:01.998
Thank you.
- Well, thank you.

I get a lot of feedback,

viewers seem to have about me

08:26.120 --> 08:28.119
is that I'm a guy
who never smiles

08:28.120 --> 08:30.120
and doesn't know
how to have fun.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.119
And that really bugs me

08:32.120 --> 08:34.119
because it couldn't be further
from the truth.

08:34.120 --> 08:38.119
In reality,
I'm actually very fun, relaxed,

08:38.120 --> 08:40.119
and easy-going.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.119
Now, obviously, I could just be
saying that to you,

08:43.120 --> 08:46.119
so tonight
I'm going to prove it.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.119
How?

08:47.120 --> 08:50.119
By spending the entire day
with a complete stranger

08:50.120 --> 08:52.119
and measuring
his dopamine levels

08:52.120 --> 08:53.119
during our hangout,

08:53.120 --> 08:55.119
comparing them
against a baseline

08:55.120 --> 08:57.120
to prove scientifically

08:58.120 --> 09:02.119
that he did have fun
hanging out with me.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.119
<i>To start things off,</i>
<i>I went on Craigslist</i>

09:04.120 --> 09:05.119
<i>and searched</i>
<i>through the listings</i>

09:05.120 --> 09:07.119
<i>in the "strictly platonic"</i>
<i>section</i>

09:07.120 --> 09:09.119
<i>in order to track down</i>
<i>a stranger</i>

09:09.120 --> 09:11.119
<i>who'd be willing</i>
<i>to spend time with me.</i>

09:11.120 --> 09:15.119
<i>I then sent emails to a handful</i>
<i>of posters looking to hang out.</i>

09:15.120 --> 09:16.119
<i>And the next day,</i>

09:16.120 --> 09:19.119
<i>after fielding a number</i>
<i>of inappropriate responses,</i>

09:19.120 --> 09:22.119
<i>I got a nice email</i>
<i>from a man named Brendan,</i>

09:22.120 --> 09:24.201
<i>who had recently relocated</i>
<i>to Los Angeles</i>

09:25.120 --> 09:26.120
<i>and seemed eager</i>
<i>to make new friends.</i>

09:26.281 --> 09:30.119
<i>So we made plans</i>
<i>to hang out later that week.</i>

09:30.120 --> 09:32.119
<i>But since this was all about</i>
<i>proving to you at home</i>

09:32.120 --> 09:34.119
<i>that I am indeed fun,</i>

09:34.120 --> 09:36.120
<i>I would need to get evidence</i>
<i>that cannot be refuted.</i>

09:37.120 --> 09:39.119
<i>So I paid a visit</i>
<i>to Dr. Whimsy Anderson,</i>

09:39.120 --> 09:41.881
<i>a specialist</i>
<i>in neurotransmitter testing,</i>

09:42.120 --> 09:44.119
<i>to advise me</i>
<i>on how to scientifically prove</i>

09:44.120 --> 09:45.119
<i>a person is fun.</i>

09:45.120 --> 09:47.120
- When someone's having fun,

09:48.120 --> 09:50.119
you might see an elevation
in serotonin,

09:50.120 --> 09:51.119
an elevation in dopamine,

09:51.120 --> 09:53.119
or an elevation

09:53.120 --> 09:55.119
of both serotonin
and dopamine both.

09:55.120 --> 09:58.119
- So, if their serotonin
or dopamine levels go up

09:58.120 --> 09:59.119
when they're
hanging out with me,

09:59.120 --> 10:03.119
that would mean that I'm fun?

10:03.120 --> 10:05.119
- For them, yes.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.119
<i>- Dr. Whimsy said,</i>
<i>to get accurate results,</i>

10:07.120 --> 10:11.119
<i>I'd need to obtain two samples</i>
<i>of either urine or blood</i>

10:11.120 --> 10:12.119
<i>from the person--</i>

10:12.120 --> 10:15.119
<i>one before our hangout began</i>
<i>to act as a baseline,</i>

10:15.120 --> 10:16.119
<i>and a second at the end</i>

10:16.120 --> 10:18.119
<i>of doing several activities</i>
<i>together.</i>

10:18.120 --> 10:20.119
<i>But knowing</i>
<i>it would skew the results</i>

10:20.120 --> 10:22.119
<i>if he was aware of what was</i>
<i>being tested,</i>

10:22.120 --> 10:24.119
<i>I would have to obtain</i>
<i>Brendan's urine</i>

10:24.120 --> 10:26.119
<i>without his knowledge.</i>

10:26.120 --> 10:28.119
<i>So, prior to his arrival</i>
<i>at my office,</i>

10:28.120 --> 10:30.119
<i>I set up a tempting selection</i>
<i>of beverages</i>

10:30.120 --> 10:32.119
<i>in the waiting area.</i>

10:32.120 --> 10:33.120
<i>Then, in the bathroom,</i>

10:34.120 --> 10:36.119
<i>I put an "out of order" sign</i>
<i>on the toilet</i>

10:36.120 --> 10:38.120
<i>and attached a clear</i>
<i>plastic bag to the urinal mat,</i>

10:39.120 --> 10:40.119
<i>creating a reservoir</i>

10:40.120 --> 10:42.119
<i>that would discreetly collect</i>
<i>any liquid stream</i>

10:42.120 --> 10:44.119
<i>on its way down the drain.</i>

10:44.120 --> 10:47.119
<i>With everything set and me</i>
<i>positioned in a van outside,</i>

10:47.120 --> 10:51.119
<i>I watched as, moments later,</i>
<i>Brendan arrived.</i>

10:51.120 --> 10:53.119
<i>To buy as much time</i>
<i>as possible,</i>

10:53.120 --> 10:55.119
<i>I sent him a text,</i>
<i>telling him I was running late</i>

10:55.120 --> 10:58.119
<i>and to wait for me</i>
<i>in the lobby.</i>

10:58.120 --> 10:59.119
<i>After only a few minutes,</i>

10:59.120 --> 11:01.119
<i>he began browsing</i>
<i>the selection of drinks</i>

11:01.120 --> 11:04.201
<i>and eventually settled</i>
<i>on a Dr. Pepper.</i>

11:05.120 --> 11:06.119
<i>Then a half hour later,</i>

11:06.120 --> 11:08.361
<i>the moment I'd been waiting for</i>
<i>finally came,</i>

11:09.120 --> 11:11.119
<i>as Brendan got up and headed</i>
<i>towards the bathroom,</i>

11:11.120 --> 11:15.119
<i>hopefully to deposit what would</i>
<i>be our baseline urine sample.</i>

11:15.120 --> 11:17.119
<i>So, once he was done,</i>

11:17.120 --> 11:19.120
<i>it was time to head in</i>
<i>to introduce myself.</i>

11:20.120 --> 11:21.119
Brendan?
- Yeah.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.119
- Hey, Nathan.
- Yeah, Brendan. How you doing?

11:22.120 --> 11:24.119
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you. Yeah.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.119
- I'm just gonna go
to the bathroom,

11:25.120 --> 11:26.119
then we can head out, okay?
- Yeah, yeah. No problem. Yeah.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.119
<i>I pretended that I had to go</i>
<i>to the bathroom too,</i>

11:29.120 --> 11:32.119
<i>but in reality, it was just so</i>
<i>I could transfer the sample</i>

11:32.120 --> 11:35.119
<i>from the secret urinal chamber</i>
<i>into the specimen cup</i>

11:35.120 --> 11:37.120
<i>while it was still fresh.</i>

11:40.120 --> 11:42.119
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>one of my production assistants</i>

11:42.120 --> 11:45.119
<i>informed Brendan that our day</i>
<i>was going to be filmed</i>

11:45.120 --> 11:47.119
<i>for a documentary</i>
<i>about Craigslist hangouts,</i>

11:47.120 --> 11:50.119
<i>and Brendan seemed more than</i>
<i>happy to participate.</i>

11:50.120 --> 11:51.119
- Yeah, sure.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.119
- <i>With his sample sealed,</i>
<i>I hid it</i>

11:53.120 --> 11:54.119
<i>underneath</i>
<i>a hollowed-out candle</i>

11:54.120 --> 11:57.119
<i>and then lit the wick</i>
<i>to signal to my unpaid intern</i>

11:57.120 --> 12:00.119
<i>that it was ready to be taken</i>
<i>to the lab for testing.</i>

12:00.120 --> 12:01.119
<i>And with the sample secured,</i>

12:01.120 --> 12:04.119
<i>I could finally begin my day</i>
<i>with Brendan.</i>

12:04.120 --> 12:06.119
I just wanted to be clear
before we leave,

12:06.120 --> 12:08.119
I posted
in the platonic section,

12:08.120 --> 12:09.119
but I know a lot of people

12:09.120 --> 12:10.120
on there were looking
for sexual stuff.

12:10.201 --> 12:12.119
That's not you, right?
- No, no, no, no, no.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.119
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Okay, good.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.119
Just wanted to make sure.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.119
- Sorry, no.
- Okay, cool.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.120
- I'm just looking for someone
to hang out with.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.119
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- That's--'Cause I--

12:19.120 --> 12:20.119
- Okay, great.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.119
<i>And with both of us</i>
<i>on the same page,</i>

12:21.120 --> 12:23.120
<i>it was time to have some fun.</i>

12:23.721 --> 12:25.119
<i>I had planned</i>
<i>several activities</i>

12:25.120 --> 12:27.120
<i>that I hoped would raise</i>
<i>Brendan's dopamine levels</i>

12:28.120 --> 12:29.119
<i>enough to get</i>
<i>the results I needed.</i>

12:29.120 --> 12:31.001
Buckle up.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.119
<i>And as we headed</i>
<i>to our first destination,</i>

12:32.120 --> 12:34.119
<i>we got to know each other.</i>

12:34.120 --> 12:36.119
- Like, "Star Wars,"
you had the red and blue factor.

12:36.120 --> 12:40.119
You had--
the dark side was the red,

12:40.120 --> 12:44.119
and the light side
was, um, blue.

12:44.120 --> 12:48.119
In "The Matrix," you had
the red pill or the blue pill.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.119
- Okay.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.119
- In "Shaun of the Dead,"

12:50.120 --> 12:52.119
the little cone
that he ate was red.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.119
- Okay.

12:53.120 --> 12:57.119
- In "Hot Fuzz,"
the color was blue.

12:57.120 --> 13:01.119
In "Next Generation,"
if they wore blue,

13:01.120 --> 13:02.119
they typically would die.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.120
In the original series,
it was red.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.119
<i>- It seemed like Brendan and I</i>
<i>didn't have a lot in common,</i>

13:11.120 --> 13:13.120
<i>but I was hopeful</i>
<i>that once he saw my fun side,</i>

13:14.120 --> 13:15.119
<i>things would change.</i>

13:15.120 --> 13:17.119
- All right.
- So...

13:17.120 --> 13:19.119
We're gonna go
into a hat store

13:19.120 --> 13:22.119
and try on silly hats.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.119
- Okay. Let's do it.
- That's fun, right?

13:24.120 --> 13:25.521
- Yeah.
- I mean, that's something--

13:26.120 --> 13:27.119
Is that fun for you?
- Yeah, let's do it.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.119
- Okay, let's go.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.119
All right.
- Oh, this is pretty cool.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.119
<i>- Trying on hats is something</i>
<i>everyone can enjoy,</i>

13:33.120 --> 13:35.119
<i>and it was the perfect way</i>
<i>to show Brendan</i>

13:35.120 --> 13:36.119
<i>that I'm the type of guy</i>

13:36.120 --> 13:38.119
<i>who doesn't take</i>
<i>himself too seriously.</i>

13:38.120 --> 13:41.119
This is what girls would wear.
- Yeah.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.119
- I don't know
about this one.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.119
<i>But Brendan wasn't having</i>
<i>the reaction I expected,</i>

13:46.120 --> 13:47.120
<i>and after we left,</i>

13:48.120 --> 13:49.119
<i>I was doubtful</i>
<i>his neurotransmitters</i>

13:49.120 --> 13:52.119
<i>were sufficiently raised</i>
<i>by the hat-store experience,</i>

13:52.120 --> 13:55.119
<i>so I was counting on the day's</i>
<i>next activity to do the trick.</i>

13:55.120 --> 13:57.119
You like go-karts?

13:57.120 --> 13:58.119
- Hell, yeah.
- Yeah?

13:58.120 --> 14:01.119
<i>Right away I could tell</i>
<i>Brendan was excited.</i>

14:01.120 --> 14:02.119
- I've got to go with red

14:02.120 --> 14:04.119
because of the red factor
in "Star Trek."

14:04.120 --> 14:05.119
- All right.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.119
<i>Go-karting is like</i>
<i>normal driving,</i>

14:07.120 --> 14:08.921
<i>except the car</i>
<i>is so much smaller,</i>

14:09.120 --> 14:10.119
<i>so the fun comes from the fact</i>

14:10.120 --> 14:13.119
<i>that you know your body</i>
<i>is too big for the car,</i>

14:13.120 --> 14:15.119
<i>and as we started going</i>
<i>around the track,</i>

14:15.120 --> 14:16.119
<i>I could tell it was working,</i>

14:16.120 --> 14:19.119
<i>'cause Brendan</i>
<i>was smiling from ear to ear.</i>

14:19.120 --> 14:21.119
[screeching]
- [laughing]

14:21.120 --> 14:23.119
<i>- It seemed like his fun levels</i>
<i>were peaking,</i>

14:23.120 --> 14:25.119
<i>so I wanted</i>
<i>to get a second sample</i>

14:25.120 --> 14:27.119
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

14:27.120 --> 14:30.119
<i>But since waiting for his urine</i>
<i>again could take hours,</i>

14:30.120 --> 14:32.119
<i>I had a plan</i>
<i>to get this sample immediately</i>

14:32.120 --> 14:34.119
<i>at a clinic</i>
<i>via blood test.</i>

14:34.120 --> 14:38.119
<i>The only thing I had to do now</i>
<i>was convince him to go.</i>

14:38.120 --> 14:42.119
You know, I was thinking...

14:42.120 --> 14:45.119
we should do something
totally random, you know?

14:45.120 --> 14:47.119
- Yeah, is there something
you want to do?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.119
- I don't know.
We should, like--

14:49.120 --> 14:51.119
we should, like, go for, like,
a blood test or something.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.119
Like, wouldn't that be crazy?
So random.

14:53.120 --> 14:57.119
Just go to a lab and get
our blood drawn and stuff?

14:57.120 --> 14:59.119
- A blood test?
An actual blood test?

14:59.120 --> 15:02.119
- Yeah.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.119
- I haven't done--
Uh, yeah.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.119
We can do that.
That sounds cool.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.119
- I mean,
they're pretty fun to do.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.119
- Yeah, let's go do
a blood test.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.119
That'd be kind of cool.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.120
<i>- And with Brendan on board,</i>
<i>we were off.</i>

15:12.733 --> 15:14.733
<i>- Coming off the thrill</i>
<i>of go-kart racing,</i>

15:14.894 --> 15:17.732
<i>I wanted to harvest Brendan's</i>
<i>blood as quickly as possible,</i>

15:17.733 --> 15:19.733
<i>so we headed</i>
<i>to a nearby medical clinic</i>

15:20.733 --> 15:22.732
<i>where I had prearranged</i>
<i>for the necessary lab work.</i>

15:22.733 --> 15:26.732
<i>To make sure his levels didn't</i>
<i>drop due to the un-fun setting,</i>

15:26.733 --> 15:28.732
<i>I asked the nurse</i>
<i>if she'd be willing to hide</i>

15:28.733 --> 15:30.732
<i>an electronic fart machine</i>
<i>on her person</i>

15:30.733 --> 15:32.732
<i>that I'd be able</i>
<i>to activate by remote control</i>

15:32.733 --> 15:33.733
<i>during the blood draw.</i>

15:34.733 --> 15:35.732
Do you think
you could do that?

15:35.733 --> 15:37.733
- Um, I'll try my best.

15:38.733 --> 15:39.732
<i>- My hope was that</i>
<i>Brendan would think</i>

15:39.733 --> 15:41.732
<i>they were real farts,</i>

15:41.733 --> 15:43.732
<i>and that the fun of that</i>
<i>would spike his dopamine levels</i>

15:43.733 --> 15:45.732
<i>right as the blood</i>
<i>was being taken.</i>

15:45.733 --> 15:47.732
- Who's going first?
- I guess I'll go first.

15:47.733 --> 15:49.732
- Do you want to? Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

15:49.733 --> 15:50.732
<i>And with Brendan in his seat,</i>

15:50.733 --> 15:53.733
<i>it was time</i>
<i>to see if this would work.</i>

15:59.733 --> 16:01.414
<i>[flatulence]</i>

16:01.733 --> 16:02.733
- Sorry about that.

16:04.733 --> 16:06.732
<i>[flatulence]</i>

16:06.733 --> 16:08.733
My apologies.

16:12.733 --> 16:13.732
<i>[flatulence]</i>

16:13.733 --> 16:14.732
Sorry.

16:14.733 --> 16:16.732
- You have some gas today?

16:16.733 --> 16:17.732
- Nope, I'm okay.

16:17.733 --> 16:18.732
- Oh, you're okay?
- Yeah, sorry about that.

16:18.733 --> 16:20.733
- Okay. That's okay.

16:23.733 --> 16:24.732
<i>[flatulence]</i>

16:24.733 --> 16:26.732
- Oh, sorry.

16:26.733 --> 16:28.732
- I mean, you should stay home
if you're that sick.

16:28.733 --> 16:30.732
- I apologize for that.

16:30.733 --> 16:32.732
- I mean, if your bowels are--
- I'm okay.

16:32.733 --> 16:35.732
We're just done, so I will be
stepping out in a moment.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.732
<i>[flatulence]</i>

16:38.733 --> 16:39.732
Sorry about that.

16:39.733 --> 16:42.732
<i>[flatulence]</i>

16:42.733 --> 16:44.732
Upset stomach today.
Sorry.

16:44.733 --> 16:46.733
- It's okay.
[chuckles]

16:47.733 --> 16:49.732
[flatulence]
<i>- My apologies.</i>

16:49.733 --> 16:50.732
<i>- The farts were working,</i>

16:50.733 --> 16:52.732
<i>and it seemed like Brendan</i>
<i>was having</i>

16:52.733 --> 16:53.732
<i>the time of his life.</i>

16:53.733 --> 16:56.732
All right, so I'm gonna
do mine, and I'll see you.

16:56.733 --> 16:57.732
- Okay.
- Okay, cool.

16:57.733 --> 16:59.732
[whispering] That was great.
Did you see he was laughing?

16:59.733 --> 17:01.732
- Yeah. That was good.
- Okay.

17:01.733 --> 17:02.732
<i>So, with everything I needed,</i>

17:02.733 --> 17:04.732
<i>it was time</i>
<i>to say good-bye to Brendan.</i>

17:04.733 --> 17:06.732
- I'll catch you
on the flip side, man.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.732
- "Flip side"?
- On the flip side.

17:08.733 --> 17:09.732
It means
"Catch you later, dude."

17:09.733 --> 17:11.732
- All right, see you, man.
- Yeah, see you.

17:11.733 --> 17:14.732
<i>- But whether this would</i>
<i>translate into actual science</i>

17:14.733 --> 17:15.732
<i>was still to be seen.</i>

17:15.733 --> 17:16.732
<i>So, later that week,</i>
<i>I returned</i>

17:16.733 --> 17:20.732
<i>to Dr. Whimsy's office,</i>
<i>nervously awaiting the results.</i>

17:20.733 --> 17:23.732
- His serotonin when he started
was within normal range.

17:23.733 --> 17:26.732
The number was 87.22.
- Uh-huh.

17:26.733 --> 17:31.732
- The day of fun,
it was 219.92,

17:31.733 --> 17:34.732
so it shot up 2.5 times
what it initially was.

17:34.733 --> 17:35.732
- Well, that's huge.

17:35.733 --> 17:37.732
- They're
very impressive numbers.

17:37.733 --> 17:41.732
So this person who was with you
was not only having fun,

17:41.733 --> 17:43.732
but they were happy,
and they had a greater sense

17:43.733 --> 17:46.732
of well-being
when they were with you.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.732
- Wow.

17:48.733 --> 17:50.732
Uh...

17:50.733 --> 17:52.733
Uh, that's amazing.

17:53.733 --> 17:55.732
'Cause, you know,
I think a part of me

17:55.733 --> 17:58.732
has always had this thing
ever since I was a kid that,

17:58.733 --> 18:02.732
you know, people maybe
don't like hanging out with me,

18:02.733 --> 18:03.732
and, you know,

18:03.733 --> 18:05.732
even though they might say
they're having fun,

18:05.733 --> 18:06.733
they're really not.

18:07.733 --> 18:09.732
And it's really hard to,
you know, have those thoughts.

18:09.733 --> 18:11.732
I think it can really
take a toll

18:11.733 --> 18:12.732
on your self-esteem a bit.

18:12.733 --> 18:14.732
You know?
- Mm-hmm.

18:14.733 --> 18:16.733
- But now
if anyone questions me

18:17.733 --> 18:19.732
and ever says
that I'm not fun

18:19.733 --> 18:21.732
or is uncomfortable
hanging out with me,

18:21.733 --> 18:24.732
I can say,
"No, you're wrong.

18:24.733 --> 18:29.733
I am fun, and it's been
scientifically proven."

18:32.733 --> 18:35.732
Uh, sorry.
I just kind of opened up to you.

18:35.733 --> 18:36.732
You're not--I don't know.
- No, that's cool.

18:36.733 --> 18:37.733
I think it's great.
- Yeah.

18:38.014 --> 18:39.733
- I think it's great.

18:41.726 --> 18:43.525
<i>- There was no denying it.</i>

18:43.526 --> 18:44.526
<i>After getting the data</i>
<i>from Dr. Whimsy,</i>

18:44.727 --> 18:48.525
<i>I now had scientific proof</i>
<i>that I am fun.</i>

18:48.526 --> 18:50.525
<i>But as I was looking</i>
<i>over Brendan's results,</i>

18:50.526 --> 18:53.525
<i>I realized that if he enjoyed</i>
<i>his time with me this much,</i>

18:53.526 --> 18:57.525
<i>maybe this could be more than</i>
<i>just an experiment for my show.</i>

18:57.526 --> 19:00.525
<i>Maybe this could be the start</i>
<i>of an actual friendship.</i>

19:00.526 --> 19:02.525
<i>So, later that week,</i>
<i>I arranged a meet-up</i>

19:02.526 --> 19:03.525
<i>at Brendan's apartment,</i>

19:03.526 --> 19:06.525
<i>because if this was gonna turn</i>
<i>into something real,</i>

19:06.526 --> 19:08.525
<i>he deserved to know the truth.</i>

19:08.526 --> 19:11.525
So, um, there's something
I should tell you.

19:11.526 --> 19:12.525
- Okay.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.525
- I mean, to start off
a friendship,

19:13.526 --> 19:15.525
you need to start
on the right foot,

19:15.526 --> 19:17.525
and that means honesty.

19:17.526 --> 19:20.525
- Yeah, exactly.
- So...

19:20.526 --> 19:23.525
um...

19:23.526 --> 19:25.525
when we were first
hanging out,

19:25.526 --> 19:28.525
I was secretly collecting
your urine

19:28.526 --> 19:30.525
to have it tested
in the lab

19:30.526 --> 19:33.526
to see if your dopamine levels
went up.

19:36.526 --> 19:38.525
- Why would you do that?

19:38.526 --> 19:42.525
- I wanted to see if you were
having fun hanging out with me.

19:42.526 --> 19:44.525
- I'm--I've never had
anybody do that.

19:44.526 --> 19:46.525
I mean...

19:46.526 --> 19:49.525
you know, secretly, you know,
taking my urine to find out

19:49.526 --> 19:51.525
if my dopamine levels
went up or not.

19:51.526 --> 19:53.525
I mean, I don't--

19:53.526 --> 19:55.525
- I mean, I know that's weird,
but it was a one-time thing.

19:55.526 --> 19:56.526
It won't happen again,

19:57.526 --> 19:59.525
and I wanted to be honest
with you,

19:59.526 --> 20:02.525
so now you know
you can trust me.

20:02.526 --> 20:03.525
- No...

20:03.526 --> 20:05.525
You--
No, you took my urine.

20:05.526 --> 20:08.525
I mean...
[sighs]

20:08.526 --> 20:10.525
I mean, if you're looking at it
in a scientific way,

20:10.526 --> 20:12.525
you know, you did
what you did, you know.

20:12.526 --> 20:15.525
I mean,
it's not gonna hurt me.

20:15.526 --> 20:18.525
I mean, it's just urine.

20:18.526 --> 20:19.527
- Am I still someone
you'd want to be friends with?

20:20.526 --> 20:21.525
- Yeah.
I mean, you just took my urine.

20:21.526 --> 20:24.525
I mean,
that's in the past, man.

20:24.526 --> 20:25.525
I'm fine.

20:25.526 --> 20:27.525
Let's--I want to go
do something today, you know.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.525
Let's go do
something exciting.

20:29.526 --> 20:30.525
