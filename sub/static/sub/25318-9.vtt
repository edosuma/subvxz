WEBVTT

00:09.444 --> 00:14.231
There is great danger in me.

00:14.275 --> 00:17.713
For those who do not understand
these mysteries

00:17.756 --> 00:23.197
shall fall into a
torment called Because,

00:23.240 --> 00:26.374
and there be ripped
apart by the teeth

00:26.417 --> 00:29.377
of Reason.

00:29.420 --> 00:33.685
The answers do
not exist without,

00:33.729 --> 00:35.731
but within.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.952
You can't see past
your own obsessions.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.520
Having aa vision
of going to the moon

00:42.564 --> 00:44.348
doesn't make it
any less impossible.

00:44.392 --> 00:48.178
Why is it you think that Mesulam
and Braxton sent me to D.C.?

00:48.222 --> 00:50.137
They needed someone
they could trust

00:50.180 --> 00:52.139
to make a sensible presentation.

00:52.182 --> 00:55.055
An actual scientist and not
someone who believes they can

00:55.098 --> 00:57.622
will things into existence.

00:57.666 --> 01:00.756
Before we make
our offering to the Great Beast,

01:00.799 --> 01:03.193
concentrate

01:03.237 --> 01:06.327
on the answers you seek.

01:06.370 --> 01:07.937
Parsons.

01:07.980 --> 01:11.419
These parts are corroded, sir.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.421
Paying me overtime's
gonna be a lot cheaper

01:13.464 --> 01:14.987
than replacing the machine.

01:15.031 --> 01:17.120
I didn't come down here
to reprimand you.

01:17.164 --> 01:20.471
I've noticed a change
in you. You're punctual.

01:20.515 --> 01:23.996
No more lastminute absences,
even working overtime.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.148
Even when no one asked you to.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.783
Yeah. I can only assume

01:27.826 --> 01:29.717
this has something to do
with your little side project

01:29.741 --> 01:32.004
not panning out. Its aims
are no longer worthy

01:32.048 --> 01:34.050
of my abilities, sir.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.662
Well, Caltech's loss
may be Pueblo Powder's gain.

01:37.706 --> 01:41.927
How would you feel about
being made supervisor?

01:41.971 --> 01:43.799
For I am in pain,

01:43.842 --> 01:46.671
desperate for the
release of union.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.159
May you be granted
the accomplishment

01:56.203 --> 01:57.900
of your true will.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.684
May you be granted
the accomplishment

01:59.728 --> 02:01.295
of your true will.

02:01.338 --> 02:02.644
May you be granted

02:02.687 --> 02:04.385
the accomplishment
of your true will.

02:06.256 --> 02:10.042
So what do you think
about the offer?

02:10.086 --> 02:12.132
Certainly a big step up.

02:12.175 --> 02:15.352
Would mean more money.

02:15.396 --> 02:18.964
More responsibility,
but we could buy a bigger house.

02:19.008 --> 02:20.966
Is that what youwant?

02:21.010 --> 02:23.055
I'm trying to do
the right thing here.

02:23.099 --> 02:25.539
I think you should do whatever
your true will tells you to do.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.453
You can stop that.
I know what you're doing.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.542
What am I doing?

02:31.586 --> 02:34.415
Giving me a taste
of my own medicine.

02:37.026 --> 02:39.289
Why are you so insistent
we go tonight?

02:39.333 --> 02:41.944
Because I'm trying, Jack.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.902
What if I'm not in the mood
to go to a mass?

02:43.946 --> 02:45.295
Well, I want to go.

02:45.339 --> 02:47.950
Would you prefer I go alone?

02:52.824 --> 02:54.739
May you be granted
the accomplishment

02:54.783 --> 02:56.828
of your true will.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.787
May you be granted
the accomplishment

02:58.830 --> 03:00.005
of your true will.

03:00.049 --> 03:01.311
May you be granted

03:01.355 --> 03:03.444
the accomplishment
of your true will.

03:06.490 --> 03:07.796
There you are.

03:07.839 --> 03:09.232
Have you got a second?

03:09.276 --> 03:10.668
Make it quick, frater.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.312
Got to get these done
before mass begins.

03:13.584 --> 03:17.109
I am this close to
my next ascension.

03:17.153 --> 03:20.069
Well, you're not the only one
up for a promotion.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.810
First degree?

03:21.853 --> 03:23.681
Man and brother of the faith? No.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.251
To supervisor.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.384
At Pueblo Powder.

03:30.427 --> 03:34.562
Supervisor.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.999
I don't know whether
I should accept.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.959
Guess you'll know what
to focus on at mass.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.526
The right answer
will reveal itself.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.006
Whether they will

03:44.049 --> 03:48.271
absorption into the infinite,
or to be united

03:48.315 --> 03:50.186
with your chosen and preferred,

03:50.230 --> 03:53.058
I say unto them,
"Love is the law."

03:56.932 --> 03:58.455
May you be granted
the accomplishment

03:58.499 --> 04:02.285
of your true will.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.026
May you be granted
the accomplishment

04:04.069 --> 04:06.985
of your true will.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.119
May you be granted

04:10.162 --> 04:12.817
the accomplishment
of your true will.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.646
Do what thou wilt

04:15.690 --> 04:17.300
shall be the whole of the law.

04:17.344 --> 04:20.260
Love is the law. Love under will.

04:20.303 --> 04:24.568
Come down, O, God,
and become one with Man.

04:24.612 --> 04:29.225
Come down, O, Man,
and become one with Beast.

the rapturous love song.

05:18.492 --> 05:21.190
Burn unto me perfume.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.366
Wear to me jewels.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.759
Drink to me.

05:24.802 --> 05:27.544
'Cause I love you.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.024
I love you.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.531
You're sure you want to go?

05:57.574 --> 05:59.402
If you're coming for me,
the least I can do

05:59.446 --> 06:00.534
is leave for you.

06:00.577 --> 06:03.145
Wait.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.583
I guess it's not up to me.

06:06.627 --> 06:10.282
You are not ready to
participate in the workings,

06:10.326 --> 06:13.808
but we have other
matters to attend to.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.165
It was...

06:25.341 --> 06:27.474
I don't really know
how to put it.

06:27.517 --> 06:30.607
Try.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.480
Shocking, I suppose.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.351
That's the idea, isn't it?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.353
Everyone has their own reaction.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.877
All are valid.

06:39.921 --> 06:43.794
I'm just trying to ascertain
how it affected you.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.235
Not up here.

06:53.108 --> 06:56.546
But here.

06:56.590 --> 07:01.769
According to Eastern healers,
this is your power center.

07:01.812 --> 07:04.380
Did you feel it
tighten during mass?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.601
Maybe.

07:07.644 --> 07:10.212
A little.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.609
What about here?

07:19.003 --> 07:21.397
Susan?

07:24.313 --> 07:25.793
Did my question

07:25.836 --> 07:28.273
embarrass you?

07:30.537 --> 07:34.758
I thought inviting you
here tonight might help

07:34.802 --> 07:37.413
your walls crumble,

07:37.457 --> 07:40.938
but it seems to have
made them taller.

07:40.982 --> 07:43.332
I'm sorry. Don't be.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.291
I'm the one who's failing.

07:47.292 --> 07:49.381
Can we try again?

07:51.296 --> 07:53.298
If you want to.

08:00.392 --> 08:03.178
Who was she?

08:08.183 --> 08:11.795
Who... was she?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.976
I only saw her for an instant
in my motherinlaw's yard,

08:19.020 --> 08:20.804
and then she was gone.

08:20.848 --> 08:25.983
And you have no sense of who
this girl was or what she means?

08:28.943 --> 08:31.336
Who was she?

08:42.304 --> 08:46.177
We haven't made much headway.

08:46.221 --> 08:50.094
I thought this vision
of the girl was the key,

08:50.138 --> 08:53.576
but the essential
agitation persists.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.622
You made the pain go away once.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.841
But it came back.

08:57.885 --> 09:01.584
If I'm being honest,
it's gotten worse.

09:01.628 --> 09:05.588
You remain so ephemeral,
not just to me, but to yourself.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.634
It's...

09:09.723 --> 09:13.117
It's as if you were made of air.

09:14.945 --> 09:18.427
Perhaps it's time we tried
a different technique.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.710
Ready?

09:44.801 --> 09:49.676
So, are you not gonna tell me
what you two did in there?

09:49.719 --> 09:51.329
You ought to know.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.375
You've been through
his purge sessions.

09:53.418 --> 09:56.204
Did you talk about me?

09:56.247 --> 09:59.468
No, Jack. Not everything
is about you.

11:25.597 --> 11:29.906
Now, this is the best
that I could come up with,

11:29.950 --> 11:31.081
based on the data.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.302
It's about damn time.

11:34.345 --> 11:37.305
Mr. Nickels, you are aware
that it's less than a month

11:37.348 --> 11:38.935
until our demonstration
with the Air Corps.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.482
I am well aware.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.789
Of course you are. You are
a highly qualified chemist.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.140
Thank you.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.446
It wasn't meant as a compliment.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.840
You were supposed to go beyond

11:50.884 --> 11:52.929
what your predecessor
was able to accomplish,

11:52.973 --> 11:55.018
and instead you've given us

11:55.062 --> 11:57.629
this paradox. Please explain how

11:57.673 --> 11:59.283
we're supposed to find aa fuel

11:59.327 --> 12:01.938
that is simultaneously
a liquid and a solid.

12:01.982 --> 12:05.550
From what I can make out
of Mr. Parsons' notes,

12:05.594 --> 12:07.770
you've wasted a lot of time

12:07.814 --> 12:10.642
going back and forth
between solid and liquid fuels.

12:10.686 --> 12:11.924
He's got a point. It doesn't matter.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.228
You can't have
a fuel that exists

12:13.254 --> 12:16.910
in two different physical states
simultaneously.

12:16.953 --> 12:19.042
If my solution's impossible,

12:19.086 --> 12:21.653
maybe that's 'cause the whole
endeavor is impossible.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.179
A solution
to an impossible problem

12:25.222 --> 12:29.400
requires someone who doesn't
believe in the impossible.

12:32.229 --> 12:36.407
You have never loved me.

12:36.451 --> 12:41.021
You have only thought it
pleasant to be in love with me.

12:45.242 --> 12:48.289
When I was at home with Papa,

12:48.332 --> 12:51.466
he would tell me his
opinion about everything,

12:51.509 --> 12:55.644
and so I had the same opinions.

12:55.687 --> 12:58.690
If I differed from him, I would

12:58.734 --> 13:00.518
conceal the fact

13:00.562 --> 13:02.651
because he would
not have liked it.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.740
He called me his doll child

13:04.784 --> 13:06.960
and he played with me

13:07.003 --> 13:10.702
just as I used to play
with my dolls.

13:12.443 --> 13:16.056
Bravo! Bravo!

13:19.755 --> 13:21.278
Knock, knock.

13:21.322 --> 13:24.238
Come in.

13:24.281 --> 13:27.458
You shouldn't have.

13:27.502 --> 13:30.113
You already got me
flowers for the opening.

13:30.157 --> 13:33.290
I really think it keeps
getting better and better.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.249
The other cast members

13:35.292 --> 13:38.687
even remembered all
their lines this time.

13:38.730 --> 13:42.082
You know, Richie, there's such
a thing as being too honest.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.912
No. II didn't mean...

13:45.955 --> 13:49.089
You have been splendid
from the start.

13:55.747 --> 13:58.098
You know, there's something
I wanted to ask you.

13:58.141 --> 13:59.577
Yeah?

13:59.621 --> 14:03.277
What would you think
about asking the Parsons

14:03.320 --> 14:06.671
to join us for dinner?

14:06.715 --> 14:09.283
Why?

14:09.326 --> 14:12.764
Well, isn't it time we met
each other's friends?

14:20.120 --> 14:22.078
Aren't you gonna say something?

14:24.124 --> 14:25.952
I don't know.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.518
Last time you talked about Jack,

14:27.562 --> 14:29.912
you made it pretty clear
you two were finished.

14:29.956 --> 14:32.045
Now you want to make peace?

14:32.088 --> 14:34.525
That's right. It just so happens

14:34.569 --> 14:36.353
there's something
I need to ask him.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.574
What?

14:39.617 --> 14:41.054
Um...

14:42.533 --> 14:44.492
It's work related.

14:44.535 --> 14:45.972
Then ask him.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.713
Why do I need to be there?

14:48.757 --> 14:50.759
Because it's less likely

14:50.802 --> 14:54.110
to turn into a bloodbath
if there are women present.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.244
That's the girl
Richard's been seeing?

15:45.118 --> 15:47.381
Why does she look familiar?

15:49.818 --> 15:51.820
Not from...

15:53.822 --> 15:56.085
What on earth is
she doing with him?

16:04.224 --> 16:07.444
Jack. Susan.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.446
Thank you so much for coming.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.840
It's so wonderful
to see you both.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.409
Um, this is Marisol.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.541
Marisol, Susan and Jack Parsons.

16:17.585 --> 16:18.978
I've heard so much about you.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.196
Likewise.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.592
We've met already, actually.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.726
Science Fantasy Society?

16:28.770 --> 16:30.293
Yes.

16:30.337 --> 16:31.642
Of course.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.427
That author...

16:33.470 --> 16:35.516
Jack Williamson? Good memory.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.866
You know I don't forget
things easily, Rich.

16:39.911 --> 16:42.349
Shall we?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.013
Thanks, Richie.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.627
Bon soir, madames et monsieurs.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.716
Can I interest you in a drink?
Great idea.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.066
We'll have your most
expensive bottle of red,

17:04.109 --> 17:05.720
s'il vous plait.

17:05.762 --> 17:08.243
It's your treat, right?

17:11.290 --> 17:14.207
It's just... it's really great
to see you, Jack.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.946
Yeah. You said that already.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.950
Well, it bears repeating.

17:18.993 --> 17:21.779
Truth is, I wasn't sure
that you'd come.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.868
All water under the bridge.

17:24.913 --> 17:27.915
Really?

17:30.962 --> 17:34.966
To err is human,
to forgive divine.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.403
You forgive me?

17:36.446 --> 17:38.057
Does anyone else hear an echo?
No.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.059
It's ju...

17:41.625 --> 17:44.976
No, you're right.
Thank you for your forgiveness

17:45.020 --> 17:47.544
and thank you again for coming.

17:47.588 --> 17:50.112
Thank Susan. She's the one
who talked me into it.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.594
What? It's the truth.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.397
Someone at this table
ought to be telling it.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.729
You know, I could stand
to freshen up.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.166
Excuse me.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.574
Gracias.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.422
I decided I could use
some freshening up myself.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.337
Knock yourself out.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.433
You need to borrow some
powder or something?

18:50.477 --> 18:54.002
We're alone now.
You can stop pretending.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.178
Perhaps you thought
I didn't remember?

18:56.222 --> 18:58.354
Hoped, more like it.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.139
What are you doing with him?

19:00.182 --> 19:02.706
And don't try to tell me this
is all some big coincidence.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.013
"There are no coincidences,

19:05.056 --> 19:08.582
only the moment your
will and path collide."

19:08.625 --> 19:10.236
Excuse me?

19:10.279 --> 19:12.542
Right. You're new. The Grand
Magus sent me after Richie.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.892
It was for your husband's sake.

19:14.936 --> 19:18.069
Help keep the rocket project
from hitting the skids.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.810
Why would Alfred
care about that?

19:21.856 --> 19:24.380
He lets you call him
by his first name.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.903
Interesting.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.384
He's devoted to his flock.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.212
I thought he was
only helping Jack,

19:30.256 --> 19:33.433
but he was helping me, too.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.478
By forcing you
to go out with Richard?

19:35.522 --> 19:37.785
He didn't force me.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.395
It was part of my workings.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.049
I was just supposed

19:41.092 --> 19:42.790
to boost Richie's confidence.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.053
Sticking with him was my idea.

19:45.096 --> 19:46.707
Thing is,

19:46.750 --> 19:50.014
ever since I was little,
I wanted to be famous.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.278
That's why I joined the Agape.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.018
I thought it would
help me get there.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.411
I don't understand.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.457
How is Richard helping you
become famous?

19:57.500 --> 20:01.200
That's the point. He's not.

20:01.243 --> 20:05.160
I realized being adored by a man
like him, starting a family,

20:05.204 --> 20:09.120
that's what I truly wanted
all along.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.037
The Great Beast works
in mysterious ways,

20:13.081 --> 20:15.126
that's for sure.

20:15.170 --> 20:18.042
Does Richard know
about any of this?

20:18.086 --> 20:22.569
You and me both know
he wouldn't approve.

20:22.612 --> 20:25.441
You should hear
the way he talks.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.313
The guy's head
over heels for me.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.879
And do you care about him?

20:28.923 --> 20:30.838
Of course.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.840
Then you should come clean.

20:32.883 --> 20:35.582
Nothing good ever
started with a lie.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.945
Thank you.

20:55.384 --> 20:59.475
So, what do you
think of Marisol?

21:01.477 --> 21:03.392
She seems swell, Richard.

21:03.436 --> 21:06.917
Are you gonna tell me
what we're doing here?

21:06.961 --> 21:09.180
What do you mean?

21:09.224 --> 21:11.705
I know this can't just be a
social call after what you did.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.272
We don't need to rehash it.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.491
I am sorry that you
felt it necessary

21:15.535 --> 21:17.580
to quit the team at such
a critical juncture.

21:20.540 --> 21:23.064
The fact of the matter is,
we still need your help.

21:23.107 --> 21:27.155
I knew it. I knew you'd be back
on your hands and knees,

21:27.198 --> 21:28.983
begging me to rejoin the team.

21:29.026 --> 21:31.202
If you'd let me finish...
I'll save you the trouble.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.901
I'll come back on one condition.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.946
That we scrap
this whole JATO business

21:35.990 --> 21:37.707
and put the military's money
towards our original objective.

21:37.731 --> 21:40.255
Jack... No negotiations, Richard.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.388
Those are my terms.
Take it or leave it.

21:42.431 --> 21:43.954
We've already replaced you.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.702
There's a new chemist
on the team.

21:52.746 --> 21:55.096
Marvin Nickels.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.359
Carnegie undergrad.

21:57.403 --> 22:01.407
Fourthyear PhD student, Caltech.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.801
Crompton's top pupil.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.281
He's fitting right in.

22:09.589 --> 22:11.417
Good for him.

22:11.460 --> 22:14.376
It's going very well.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.814
The team's making
excellent headway.

22:17.858 --> 22:20.208
Is that right?

22:20.251 --> 22:25.387
In fact, Marvin has come up
with a brilliant solution

22:25.431 --> 22:27.346
to the fuel problem
using your notes.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.739
My notes? Yes. And I'd like to pick
your brain about it.

22:29.783 --> 22:32.307
You're stealing
the fruits of my labor?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.309
Your research
belongs to Caltech.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.571
All of our research does.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.356
You son of a bitch.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.273
Maybe this was a bad idea.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.101
You're damn right
it was a bad idea.

22:44.145 --> 22:47.061
You want to know what
I think about Marisol?

22:47.104 --> 22:48.889
I think you should make sure

22:48.932 --> 22:50.673
she's with you
for the right reasons.

22:50.717 --> 22:54.329
Hey, fellas.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.379
What happened?

23:09.997 --> 23:11.651
That's what she said.

23:11.694 --> 23:14.175
And you believed her?

23:14.218 --> 23:16.873
Why else would she go
after Richard?

23:16.917 --> 23:21.356
Though... I do find it odd
that you'd...

23:21.400 --> 23:24.620
Interfere with
their personal affairs?

23:24.664 --> 23:26.970
Well, yes.

23:27.014 --> 23:29.190
Let me ask you something.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.932
Did Marisol seem happy?

23:33.237 --> 23:36.066
Yes, I suppose so.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.678
That's what we aim
to do here, isn't it?

23:43.683 --> 23:45.685
Shall we?

23:48.818 --> 23:52.039
The answers we seek

23:52.082 --> 23:57.000
might not come
through questioning alone.

23:57.044 --> 24:01.178
As an air elemental,

24:01.222 --> 24:04.704
you need to be contained.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.931
Who was she?

24:14.975 --> 24:17.891
I told you I only
saw her for a moment.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.849
Who was she?

24:19.893 --> 24:22.939
I don't know.

24:22.983 --> 24:24.506
How old was she?

24:24.550 --> 24:27.378
12, 13, maybe?

24:27.422 --> 24:29.032
What else?

24:29.076 --> 24:31.774
Close your eyes and focus.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.083
What else did you
notice about her?

24:36.126 --> 24:39.695
She had something in her mouth.

24:39.739 --> 24:40.914
What?

24:42.350 --> 24:46.180
Does that have any significance
to you?

24:46.223 --> 24:48.312
Oranges make me sick to my stomach.
Why?

24:48.356 --> 24:49.796
They just do.
I've always hated them.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.099
Always? As far back
as I can remember.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.541
There was an orange grove
behind my house.

24:59.585 --> 25:02.152
I kept as far away from it
as I could.

25:02.196 --> 25:04.459
Why? I told you, I'ml'm allergic.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.574
Concentrate, Susan.

25:35.882 --> 25:38.493
What is it? What are you seeing?

25:41.801 --> 25:43.280
Nothing.

25:54.335 --> 25:56.772
What did you see?

26:05.172 --> 26:07.261
What did you see?

26:07.304 --> 26:08.697
Let me out from under here.

26:08.741 --> 26:10.525
What did you see?

26:10.569 --> 26:12.962
I saw me.

26:16.487 --> 26:20.753
Why would you be
so frightened of yourself?

26:51.305 --> 26:53.612
Can I help you, sir?

27:09.149 --> 27:11.891
Hey.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.849
Mr. Onsted, you might
want to come in here.

27:13.893 --> 27:14.763
No.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.243
I've got nothing to say to him.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.943
MMr. Parsons? Move.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.684
It's an honor to meet you.

27:22.728 --> 27:25.078
Youyou work with stuff I'd
never have the guts to handle.

27:25.121 --> 27:26.688
Yeah, well, a lot of good
that did me.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.647
Well, what do you mean?
Everything's pretty much

27:28.690 --> 27:30.126
ground to a halt since you quit.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.216
Look, I don't have time
to recreate your results,

27:33.260 --> 27:34.890
and especially not if I
follow proper protocol,

27:34.914 --> 27:36.916
which, I guess, was less
of a problem for you.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.266
After so many false starts,

27:39.309 --> 27:42.704
Mr. Onsted pushed me to come up
with a theoretical solution.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.271
Sounds like Richard. Yeah, well,

27:44.314 --> 27:46.634
too bad the solution I came up
with is friggin' impossible.

27:48.101 --> 27:49.929
What solution?

27:51.844 --> 27:53.715
Um, in order to build a JATO

27:53.759 --> 27:56.675
that will burn evenly
and be light enough,

27:56.718 --> 28:01.027
we need a fuel that acts like
both a solid and a liquid.

28:06.293 --> 28:09.513
A solid and a liquid.

28:09.557 --> 28:12.560
Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

28:12.603 --> 28:13.953
Unless you have
any bright ideas.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.174
Jack.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.176
What a nice surprise.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.744
And also welltimed. What
are you doing here?

28:22.788 --> 28:25.486
Collecting my things. These belong
to Caltech. I told you that.

28:25.529 --> 28:26.617
Let go.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.492
I tried being nice,

28:31.535 --> 28:33.494
inviting you to a very
expensive dinner.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.670
A genuine apology would have
gotten you a lot further.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.541
You're the one who should
be apologizing to me

28:37.585 --> 28:38.780
the way you spoke about Marisol.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.284
I wasn't insulting her,
I was insulting you.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.724
Ask yourself, Richard.

28:45.767 --> 28:50.076
What could a girl like that
possibly see in you?

28:52.861 --> 28:55.255
I'll have you all know
that I've been offered

28:55.298 --> 28:57.170
a very significant
job promotion.

28:57.213 --> 29:01.391
Where? Pueblo Powder Company?

29:06.701 --> 29:08.921
Unlike some people,
they recognize the fact

29:08.964 --> 29:11.445
that I'm irreplaceable.

29:14.665 --> 29:18.495
You know what? Take them.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.106
If the answer was
in those notebooks,

29:20.149 --> 29:21.324
we would have succeeded

29:21.368 --> 29:23.326
a long time ago.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.775
Susan?

30:20.819 --> 30:23.517
You'll never guess what happened
out in the arroyo today.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.214
Richard didn't just
steal my work,

30:25.258 --> 30:28.130
he used my plans for the lab
and the testing facility.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.916
Everything is exactly
as I said it should be.

30:32.700 --> 30:36.051
You should have seen him,
completely stalled without me.

30:36.095 --> 30:39.402
My socalled replacement
came up with a fuel solution

30:39.446 --> 30:42.362
they claim is impossible.

30:42.405 --> 30:43.754
We'll see about that.

33:10.162 --> 33:14.383
I am known to you
by my name, Nuit,

33:14.427 --> 33:17.386
and to him by a secret name,

33:17.430 --> 33:22.391
which I shall give to him
when he at last knoweth me.

33:35.404 --> 33:38.059
What are you doing right now? Nothing.

33:41.323 --> 33:42.629
You need help with something.

33:43.978 --> 33:45.545
Yeah. Come on.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.114
You gonna tell me? Tell you what?

33:49.157 --> 33:50.811
How you got that cut
on your arm.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.117
A working.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.989
Last one before ascension
to the second triad.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.905
Were you trying to manifest
anything in particular?

33:57.948 --> 33:59.124
What about you, Jack?

33:59.167 --> 34:00.690
You want to tell me
what we're doing

34:00.734 --> 34:03.084
setting off rockets in the
middle of the goddamn night?

34:03.128 --> 34:04.564
A test.

34:04.607 --> 34:06.324
I still don't know whether
to take that promotion

34:06.348 --> 34:09.482
in Pueblo. Then you shouldn't.

34:09.525 --> 34:10.918
If I do the job,
I can give Susan

34:10.960 --> 34:12.050
the life she always wanted.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.442
Or at least the one

34:13.485 --> 34:15.400
she used to want.
I don't know anymore.

34:15.444 --> 34:16.967
So take it.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.447
It's not that easy.

34:18.491 --> 34:21.842
It would mean giving up
on this, our project.

34:21.885 --> 34:25.150
You really want to go
crawling back to Richard?

34:25.193 --> 34:26.847
I don't know.

34:28.630 --> 34:30.719
And even if he took me back,

34:30.764 --> 34:33.158
it would mean working
on something I don't believe in.

34:36.335 --> 34:38.163
See, it's all well
and good to talk about

34:38.206 --> 34:39.641
following your true path,

34:39.686 --> 34:42.167
but what if you're faced
with two bad turns in the road?

34:42.210 --> 34:44.101
You remember the first night
I brought you up here?

34:44.125 --> 34:45.561
It was standing right there.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.304
You mean the mountain lion?

34:49.348 --> 34:51.567
No, Jack, the Great Beast.

34:51.610 --> 34:53.743
He showed you the way.

34:53.786 --> 34:56.964
He did it then.
He'll do it again.

35:25.253 --> 35:27.255
Okay.

36:13.475 --> 36:16.391
You've fired off a
million rockets, Jack.

36:16.435 --> 36:19.133
Don't let this one mean
more than it has to.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.788
"Who am I,
and what shall be the sign?"

36:21.831 --> 36:23.181
What's that?

36:25.052 --> 36:26.619
Book of the Law, first chapter.

36:26.662 --> 36:28.316
Verse 26.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.884
That's all I needed, a sign.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.453
To point me
in the right direction.

36:38.892 --> 36:42.287
You're just gonna give up?

36:42.330 --> 36:43.723
Jack!

36:43.766 --> 36:48.075
You want a sign?
Here's your goddamn sign.

36:48.118 --> 36:49.226
What are you doing with that?

36:49.250 --> 36:51.339
I took it.
There is no law beyond

36:51.383 --> 36:53.646
"do what thou wilt."

36:53.689 --> 36:57.127
That was my father's.

36:57.171 --> 36:58.738
You mean the one
that abandoned you?

36:58.781 --> 37:00.305
Shut your fucking mouth.

37:00.348 --> 37:02.748
Nothing else matters in this
life but being true to yourself.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.700
I tried. People keep
getting in my way.

37:04.744 --> 37:06.049
Open your damn eyes!

37:06.093 --> 37:07.399
You remember what it felt like

37:07.442 --> 37:08.922
when I took you up
in that crop duster

37:08.965 --> 37:10.967
and everything else
just faded away?

37:11.011 --> 37:12.099
I'm going home, Ernest.

37:14.144 --> 37:15.276
Let go of me.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.799
Not gonna happen,
Jack, not ever.

37:16.843 --> 37:20.368
I am the only one who's gotten
you closer to what you want.

37:30.944 --> 37:32.293
Get the fuck off me!

37:38.256 --> 37:41.781
A ka dua.

37:41.824 --> 37:44.479
Tuf ur biu.

37:53.793 --> 37:55.316
Never forget who you are, Jack.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.841
You're not a supervisor.
You are a marvel!

37:58.885 --> 38:00.408
Am I part of your "workings"?

38:00.452 --> 38:02.454
Can't outrun your destiny, Jack.

38:02.497 --> 38:05.892
A man of will
knows no boundaries.

38:05.935 --> 38:07.720
Stay the fuck away from me.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.504
Jack!

38:19.601 --> 38:23.039
If we take the entire population
of Los Angeles County,

38:23.083 --> 38:24.954
it's roughly 2.5 million people,

38:24.998 --> 38:27.130
and divide that in two,

38:27.174 --> 38:29.176
because I'm only
interested in women,

38:29.219 --> 38:31.004
obviously, but then,

38:31.047 --> 38:33.354
we need to remove everyone
that's not age appropriate,

38:33.398 --> 38:37.358
which reduces that number
by at least twothirds.

38:37.402 --> 38:42.232
So 416,666.66.

38:42.276 --> 38:44.365
Well, it'sit's
a repeating decimal,

38:44.409 --> 38:45.845
so let's just call it 416,667.

38:45.888 --> 38:48.717
Yeah, let's.

38:48.761 --> 38:51.459
But then we need
to reduce it even further.

38:51.503 --> 38:53.243
For one, I don't own a car,

38:53.287 --> 38:56.377
so am somewhat limited
geographically.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.423
And accounting for
ageappropriate women

38:58.466 --> 39:00.076
that live in a close proximity,

39:00.120 --> 39:02.252
that brings the number down
by at least

39:02.296 --> 39:04.080
threequarters,
and let's face it,

39:04.124 --> 39:07.388
I'm not gonna find every
ageappropriate woman nearby

39:07.432 --> 39:08.626
attractive and an even smaller

39:08.650 --> 39:10.696
percentage will be
interested in me.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.195
What'd I say about
selling yourself short?

39:12.219 --> 39:13.742
The point is, um,

39:13.786 --> 39:17.746
when you account for taste,
there are about 5,208 women

39:17.790 --> 39:20.532
in all of Los Angeles that are
theoretically suitable,

39:20.575 --> 39:23.143
or .2% of the entire population.

39:23.186 --> 39:26.494
And when you factor in women
that are single

39:26.538 --> 39:31.760
and, more critically, how many
I'll get along with...

39:31.804 --> 39:35.416
Well, at that point, the math
gets quite complicated.

39:37.766 --> 39:40.334
Suffice it to say,

39:40.378 --> 39:44.382
you, my dear,
are a statistical anomaly.

39:46.209 --> 39:49.691
One in a million, or...

39:49.735 --> 39:51.954
rather, um...

39:51.998 --> 39:55.262
.992

39:55.305 --> 39:57.438
in 2.5 million.

39:57.482 --> 40:00.702
Why are you telling me all this?

40:02.487 --> 40:05.228
Can't you see that...

40:05.272 --> 40:09.015
you are literally
the one for me.

40:09.058 --> 40:10.669
This math proves it.

40:10.712 --> 40:14.324
Did something make you doubt it?

40:14.368 --> 40:17.850
Richie.

40:17.893 --> 40:22.681
You don't need math.
You just need faith.

40:27.163 --> 40:28.556
You're right.

40:33.735 --> 40:37.783
I've never felt
this way about anyone.

40:37.826 --> 40:40.960
I wasn't even entirely
sure that I was capable.

40:43.702 --> 40:47.140
I guess this is my way
of trying to say something

40:47.183 --> 40:49.708
that could more efficiently

40:49.751 --> 40:52.667
be expressed in three words...

40:59.065 --> 41:00.458
I love you.

41:03.025 --> 41:05.854
And I'm fairly certain that

41:05.898 --> 41:09.467
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

41:15.777 --> 41:17.866
Did I say too much?

41:17.910 --> 41:20.347
II'm sorry, but it's the truth.

41:20.390 --> 41:23.089
No, no, it's not that.

41:23.132 --> 41:27.572
It's just...

41:27.615 --> 41:29.965
There's something
I have to tell you.

41:38.626 --> 41:42.587
The night we met

41:42.630 --> 41:45.807
wasn't a coincidence.

41:48.723 --> 41:50.116
What happened next?

41:57.297 --> 41:59.517
What happened next?

41:59.560 --> 42:01.910
I told you,
that's all I can remember.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.784
It's not working.

42:05.827 --> 42:08.743
Try again.

42:17.143 --> 42:19.275
There's nothing else.

42:19.319 --> 42:21.277
Keep trying.

42:23.149 --> 42:24.759
Please, can we stop?

42:28.894 --> 42:30.504
What is it?
Are you seeing something?

42:32.114 --> 42:34.029
Tell me.

42:34.073 --> 42:35.596
Susan?

42:35.640 --> 42:37.598
Susan.

42:47.347 --> 42:49.088
Come on.

42:49.131 --> 42:50.524
Who is it?

42:50.568 --> 42:53.005
Who was there with you, Susan?

43:03.276 --> 43:05.452
I'll take it.

43:05.495 --> 43:08.890
Wise decision. Was surprised you
needed so long to think on it.

43:37.353 --> 43:38.964
Hey, um, do you know
what happened

43:39.007 --> 43:40.705
to the guy who lives here?

43:40.748 --> 43:45.448
Beats me. Landlord said
he took off without paying rent.

43:45.492 --> 43:49.148
He a friend of yours?

43:49.191 --> 43:51.629
No. Hardly knew him.

44:13.781 --> 44:15.217
Hello?

44:20.701 --> 44:22.094
Hello?

45:55.709 --> 45:57.058
Jack!

45:57.102 --> 45:58.625
Jack, what are you doing?

45:58.668 --> 46:00.018
I'm getting rid of everything.

46:00.061 --> 46:02.281
You should understand.

46:02.324 --> 46:05.501
You're such a big believer
in purging all of a sudden.

46:05.545 --> 46:07.634
I'm done pretending.

46:07.677 --> 46:09.897
I'm not gonna lead
mankind to the moon.

46:09.941 --> 46:11.812
I'm not gonna bend
the world to my will.

46:11.856 --> 46:14.510
I'm a gainfully employed
chemical company supervisor.

46:14.554 --> 46:16.251
Jack...

46:16.295 --> 46:19.733
It's okay. It's okay.

46:19.777 --> 46:22.257
This is for the best, really.

46:22.301 --> 46:23.868
You were right about the Agape.

46:23.911 --> 46:26.392
It does corrupt people.

46:26.435 --> 46:28.718
It makes them believe that they
can have anything they want,

46:28.742 --> 46:30.004
however twisted.

46:30.048 --> 46:32.964
Jack, I don't... Please, let me finish.

46:33.007 --> 46:35.967
Ernest left this
godforsaken neighborhood,

46:36.010 --> 46:37.446
and we're getting
out of here, too.

46:37.490 --> 46:40.014
You want three bedrooms?
Why not four?

46:40.058 --> 46:42.147
Heck, maybe we'll have twins.

46:42.190 --> 46:43.757
But most of all,

46:43.801 --> 46:48.544
you can stop
punishing me by going.

46:48.588 --> 46:52.070
Okay? I've learned my lesson.

46:52.113 --> 46:55.987
I just want things to go back
to the way they used to be.

46:58.163 --> 46:59.599
What if I can't?

47:00.948 --> 47:04.952
I don't think I can go back
to who I used to be.

47:06.606 --> 47:07.694
I don't want to.

47:09.174 --> 47:11.959
Please don't say that.

47:12.003 --> 47:13.831
II know I've made some mistakes.

47:13.874 --> 47:15.223
It's not that. I...

47:15.267 --> 47:20.098
I learned something today,

47:20.141 --> 47:24.972
something about myself.

47:25.016 --> 47:27.801
What?

47:30.499 --> 47:32.110
What?

47:35.853 --> 47:38.551
I'm sorry.

47:45.210 --> 47:46.864
Does the Grand Magus know?

47:54.872 --> 47:57.178
Don't, don't.I'm done with all of it.

48:01.269 --> 48:03.924
I want my wife back.

48:23.639 --> 48:25.772
Shit.
