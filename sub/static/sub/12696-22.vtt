WEBVTT

00:07.733 --> 00:08.900
- All right, guys.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.167
I called this
emergency band meeting

00:10.267 --> 00:11.600
to talk about last night's gig.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.533
No one showed up

00:13.633 --> 00:16.500
because Phoebe decided
to throw an ice skating party.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.067
- Uh. You're right,
meeting adjourned.

00:21.467 --> 00:23.300
- How'd she even find
a frozen pond?

00:23.400 --> 00:25.033
It was like
90 degrees out yesterday.

00:25.133 --> 00:29.533
- Obviously, she froze it
with her...

00:29.633 --> 00:32.267
icy heart.

00:32.367 --> 00:34.800
You guys are finally finding out
what I've known all along.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.933
Phoebe Thunderman,
not a nice person.

00:38.033 --> 00:39.567
- Hey, boys,
I brought you some cookies.

00:39.667 --> 00:40.567
- Sweet-ches!

00:40.667 --> 00:41.700
- You're so nice.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.433
- Wolfgang.

00:43.533 --> 00:46.733
- Guys!
What did we just talk about?

00:47.900 --> 00:48.800
- You're terrible.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.733
- Wolfgang.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.000
- Yeah, let's go, guys.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.567
Don't tell, Max.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.433
- So, it's Mom's birthday
tonight.

01:00.533 --> 01:02.100
Any ideas
what we should get her?

01:02.200 --> 01:03.500
- How 'bout
an ice skating party?

01:03.600 --> 01:06.567
- Nah, nothing'll
beat last night's.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.800
Wait. Are you mad
about my ice skating party?

01:08.900 --> 01:10.067
I invited you.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.800
- Yes,
along with the whole school,

01:11.900 --> 01:12.967
which is why no one showed up

01:13.067 --> 01:14.800
to see my band
make rock history.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.900
- Okay, other bands have played
three songs without messing up.

01:17.067 --> 01:18.933
- But we haven't!

01:21.867 --> 01:23.633
- Hey, you two, cool it.

01:23.733 --> 01:24.933
- BOTH: With pleasure.

01:25.067 --> 01:26.533
- Stop it!

01:26.633 --> 01:29.100
Come on, you guys,
it's my birthday.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.800
- BOTH: Happy Birthday.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.567
- Enough!

01:32.667 --> 01:35.300
You two need to stop fighting
all the time.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.767
You know, my sister and I
always fought, but--

01:37.867 --> 01:40.467
- But then you and Aunt Mandy
realized family shouldn't fight,

01:40.567 --> 01:42.800
and you rode off on a unicorn
named Gilly

01:42.900 --> 01:44.733
all the way to Best Friend Land.

01:44.833 --> 01:46.067
- Okay, Gilly was our dog.

01:46.133 --> 01:48.267
And you're ruining my story.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.667
- Okay, Mom, if you
and Aunt Mandy are besties,

01:50.767 --> 01:51.967
how come we've never met her?

01:52.067 --> 01:53.100
- You don't know
how lucky you are you

01:53.200 --> 01:54.833
to get to see your sister
every day.

01:54.933 --> 01:58.067
And if you don't unfreeze her,
I'm gonna ground you.

02:00.467 --> 02:02.067
- You know,
can't you two, please,

02:02.167 --> 02:03.167
just learn how to get along?

02:03.267 --> 02:04.300
I mean, honestly, that would be

02:04.400 --> 02:06.133
the best birthday gift
you could give me.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.100
- We're not giving her
that gift, right?

02:11.200 --> 02:12.900
- Yeah, no.

02:13.067 --> 02:15.433
Especially 'cause I just came up
with an even better gift.

02:15.533 --> 02:17.167
We should track down Aunt Mandy

02:17.267 --> 02:18.767
and invite her
to Mom's birthday dinner.

02:18.867 --> 02:19.933
- Still don't like you,

02:20.067 --> 02:21.867
but that gift
is the right price.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.667
Free.

02:25.233 --> 02:28.867
- Oh, I'm sorry,
did you say free or freeze?

02:28.967 --> 02:31.767
Uh, I guess we'll never know.

02:31.867 --> 02:34.567
- *

02:34.667 --> 02:37.567
* What you see
is not what you get *

02:37.667 --> 02:40.767
* Living our lives
with a secret *

02:40.867 --> 02:43.933
* We fit right in,
bet you'd never guess *

02:44.067 --> 02:47.467
* Because we're living our lives
just like all the rest *

02:47.567 --> 02:51.167
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

02:51.267 --> 02:54.267
* But closer you might see
the crazy things we do *

02:54.367 --> 02:55.867
* This isn't make-believe

02:55.967 --> 02:57.400
* It's our reality

02:57.500 --> 03:00.400
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

03:00.500 --> 03:02.167
* And stay out of trouble

03:02.267 --> 03:05.300
* Living a double life *

03:09.833 --> 03:13.100
- Uh, Blackjack's
totally my game. Hit me.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.567
- Uh!
- Ah!

03:14.667 --> 03:16.500
With the card, not your paw.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.333
- Gotta read the sign
more closely.

03:18.433 --> 03:21.600
This isn't Blackjack,
it's Slapjack.

03:21.700 --> 03:22.600
Slapjack!

03:22.700 --> 03:25.067
- Ah!

03:25.100 --> 03:26.933
- Max, we have a problem.

03:27.067 --> 03:28.767
- I know. You ruined my gig

03:28.867 --> 03:30.467
and still think you're allowed
to come into my room.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.067
Colosso, hit her.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.133
- In a minute.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.267
I'm training a new waitress.

03:35.367 --> 03:38.367
Ruby, only one cherry per drink.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.333
- It's about Mom's present.

03:42.433 --> 03:43.600
I got Aunt Mandy's number
off her phone,

03:43.700 --> 03:45.467
and I keep calling it,
but no one's answering.

03:45.567 --> 03:46.933
- Give me that.

03:47.067 --> 03:50.367
I can use Aunt Mandy's number
to triangulate her position.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.300
- But she could be
anywhere in the world.

03:52.400 --> 03:57.133
Paris,
Hawaii, Barcelona.

03:57.233 --> 03:59.067
- She's in Metroburg.

03:59.133 --> 04:00.633
- That's so close. That's weird.

04:00.733 --> 04:04.667
- And what's weird is you
"Barcelona-ed" all over my face.

04:04.767 --> 04:06.067
- Okay, at least now
we can go find her

04:06.100 --> 04:08.067
and bring her home to
Mom's birthday dinner tonight.

04:08.133 --> 04:09.300
Thunder bump.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.200
- No, sure.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.900
How many bumps you want?

04:13.067 --> 04:14.233
- *

04:14.333 --> 04:15.833
- Since the dawn of time,

04:15.933 --> 04:18.933
man has yearned
for true deliciousness.

04:19.067 --> 04:20.633
And thanks
to your mother's birthday,

04:20.733 --> 04:23.867
today, we shall taste it.

04:23.967 --> 04:27.867
Behold,
the chocolate munch cake.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.333
- It's amazing.

04:29.433 --> 04:31.100
- It's a work of art.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.400
- It's going in my belly!

04:32.500 --> 04:33.900
- Whoa, whoa!

04:34.067 --> 04:35.500
No frosting swipes.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.133
I flew a long way
to get this cake

04:37.233 --> 04:40.333
from a celebrity-owned bakery
your mom read about.

04:41.900 --> 04:44.667
Was it one of those hamsters
from that car commercial?

04:44.767 --> 04:47.600
Now we know how they can afford
those cars.

04:47.700 --> 04:48.933
- All right, you two,

04:49.067 --> 04:53.333
I'm putting you in charge
of keeping my cake safe.

04:54.733 --> 04:56.767
- I wish I did, Nora.

04:56.867 --> 04:58.800
I wish I did.

04:58.900 --> 05:00.067
- That's cool.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.800
We've never been in charge
of anything before.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.167
- Yeah. It feels good knowing

05:03.267 --> 05:05.600
Dad thinks we're
responsible enough to

05:05.700 --> 05:06.933
Chloe, don't!

05:11.900 --> 05:13.667
- She did a five-finger swipe.

05:13.767 --> 05:17.100
- And I'd do it again, baby.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.900
- Okay, this is bad.

05:19.067 --> 05:20.700
But we can fix it.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.333
Chloe can teleport us
to the bakery to get a new cake.

05:23.433 --> 05:24.567
- Good idea.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.667
Now we just have to get rid
of the old cake.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.133
- Told ya I'd do it again.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.900
- *

05:40.367 --> 05:41.533
Sure we're in the right place?

05:41.633 --> 05:43.567
- You're just mad
we're in Metroburg

05:43.667 --> 05:46.800
and not somewhere exotic like...

05:46.900 --> 05:49.733
oh,  Fort Lauderdale.

05:49.833 --> 05:50.567
Or...

05:50.667 --> 05:52.133
- You spin it you buy it.

05:52.233 --> 05:54.500
- Ah!
- Ah!

05:57.600 --> 06:01.067
- Well, I am...Equator.

06:01.133 --> 06:04.433
And this is my associate
Phoebe Thunderman.

06:04.533 --> 06:05.867
- Wait.

06:05.967 --> 06:09.367
As in Phoebe and Max Thunderman?

06:11.633 --> 06:13.167
I am Equator.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.067
- I'm your Aunt Mandy!

06:20.133 --> 06:21.300
Ah, bring it in.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.500
Come here, ahhh!

06:24.600 --> 06:27.067
- Wow. It's so nice
to finally meet you.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.200
So are you like

06:28.300 --> 06:30.567
using your invisibility
to go undercover here?

06:30.667 --> 06:31.567
- Of course she is.

06:31.667 --> 06:32.833
Why else would a superhero

06:32.933 --> 06:35.433
be in the most useless store
in the world?

06:35.533 --> 06:37.100
- I own this place.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.300
- Oh, Phoebe, fix this.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.300
- I don't get it.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.533
How can you own this place?

06:41.633 --> 06:43.167
Our Mom said you were
so busy saving the world.

06:43.267 --> 06:44.233
- I am.

06:46.467 --> 06:47.733
See?

06:47.833 --> 06:51.267
These little things
mean the world to me.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.700
That is gonna kill at Globe Con.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.067
All six of us
are gonna laugh so hard.

06:59.133 --> 07:01.067
- Well, obviously,
you've got your hands full

07:01.133 --> 07:04.200
fighting the forces
of uneven shelving.

07:04.300 --> 07:07.067
But, uh, is there any way
you would like to come to dinner

07:07.133 --> 07:09.067
and surprise our mom
for her birthday?

07:10.567 --> 07:13.400
We haven't seen each other
in so long.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.367
She should would be surprised.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.833
- Wouldn't miss it.

07:19.933 --> 07:22.867
- Just let me bust
this shoplifter first.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.333
- Uh...had a big lunch.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.933
- *

07:36.967 --> 07:38.567
- Okay, let's hurry up
and get the new cake

07:38.667 --> 07:40.100
before Dad notices we're gone.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.267
- Okay.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.433
- Here you go.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.900
- That's the celebrity
Mom read about.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.467
Deena the Dessert Diva.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.233
- She makes
hilarious Twine videos

07:51.333 --> 07:53.767
where she turns people
into dessert dummies.

07:53.867 --> 07:55.733
Check out this gold.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.500
- Bear claw attack.

08:05.733 --> 08:07.800
- Looks like somebody's
glazed and confused.

08:11.267 --> 08:13.367
- Next.

08:13.467 --> 08:15.800
Welcome to Bakery Home Tonight.

08:15.900 --> 08:19.200
- One chocolate munch cake,
please.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.733
- That'll be 100 bucks.

08:22.633 --> 08:24.500
Expensive, right?

08:24.600 --> 08:26.667
I love being famous.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.967
- Um, we're a little short.

08:29.067 --> 08:32.767
- Mom says it's because
we watch too much TV.

08:32.867 --> 08:34.167
- If you don't have the cash,

08:34.267 --> 08:36.233
there is another way
you could pay.

08:36.333 --> 08:39.200
You could be in my next
Dessert Dummies video.

08:39.300 --> 08:41.333
- So we'd be the ones
getting pranked

08:41.433 --> 08:42.633
in one of you Twine videos?

08:42.733 --> 08:43.867
- Mm-hmm.

08:43.967 --> 08:45.467
- Yeah, that's not happening.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.800
We'll come back with the cash.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.500
- Chloe,
did you frosting swipe again?

08:51.600 --> 08:55.233
- I have a problem.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.900
- *

09:00.467 --> 09:01.700
- Oooh, an old penny!

09:01.800 --> 09:03.533
We'll have that cake in no time.

09:03.633 --> 09:04.767
- That's not a penny.

09:04.867 --> 09:07.533
It's a linty mint.

09:07.633 --> 09:09.967
- Hello, old friend.

09:10.067 --> 09:13.233
- Billy, stop eating
the couch mint.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.667
It's time
for your mom's birthday dinner!

09:15.767 --> 09:17.633
Get the cake ready.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.100
Max and Phoebe
aren't even home yet.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.767
- We're home.

09:24.867 --> 09:25.833
- Good, you're all here.

09:25.933 --> 09:26.967
You're all gonna wanna see

09:27.067 --> 09:28.300
the awesome birthday gift
we got Mom.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.500
- Oh, you kids
didn't have to get me something.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.600
I'm just kidding!

09:32.700 --> 09:34.333
Mama loves gifts.

09:34.433 --> 09:35.567
Where it is?

09:35.667 --> 09:38.267
- It's right here.

09:38.367 --> 09:41.967
- Happy Birthday, Barbie.

09:43.467 --> 09:45.167
- Surprise.

09:45.267 --> 09:49.067
- This party's going to be
your worst nightmare.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.500
- Surprise number two.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.967
- *

10:00.633 --> 10:01.833
- *

10:01.933 --> 10:04.867
This may have been
a horrible idea.

10:04.967 --> 10:06.033
- I should have known better.

10:06.133 --> 10:07.800
I got a sister
for my birthday once.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.700
My life's been a nightmare
ever since.

10:11.767 --> 10:13.033
- Nobody move.

10:13.133 --> 10:16.667
It's a McBooger sister standoff.

10:19.867 --> 10:23.433
She was Barbara McBooger?

10:23.533 --> 10:27.767
- Let's see, what party game
should we play first, huh?

10:27.867 --> 10:30.667
Oooh, how 'bout
kick the penguin?

10:30.767 --> 10:32.500
- Yeah,
that's not a party game.

10:37.267 --> 10:38.600
- Way to go, Phoebe.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.933
You can add
"ruin Mom's birthday"

10:40.033 --> 10:41.400
to the list of things
you destroyed this week.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.567
- We're not talking about
your dumb gig right now.

10:43.667 --> 10:44.633
We need to figure out

10:44.733 --> 10:46.067
why the McBooger sisters
hate each other.

10:46.167 --> 10:49.533
Can't even say that
with a straight face.

10:49.633 --> 10:51.333
- So, you haven't told
your Thunder-lings

10:51.433 --> 10:52.800
about our falling out?

10:52.900 --> 10:53.867
- I didn't want them to see

10:53.967 --> 10:56.500
how ugly it could get
between siblings.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.600
- Oh, you're right.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.200
I won't let them see it.

11:01.733 --> 11:04.500
Wet willy!
- Ah!

11:04.600 --> 11:05.733
- Mandy!

11:05.833 --> 11:07.567
Barb, isn't going to
stoop to your level.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.800
She is a mature adult!

11:09.900 --> 11:12.533
- Eat lightning,
Mandy Man Hands!

11:18.867 --> 11:20.367
- MANDY: I'm over by Hank.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.400
- MANDY: Ha-ha, made you shoot.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.633
- MANDY: Oopsie.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.700
- Well, I guess this means

11:34.800 --> 11:37.400
we'll have to cancel
Mom's birthday dinner.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.567
I'll go throw out the cake.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.333
No, take the cake
to the backup frig in the garage

11:42.433 --> 11:43.500
and stay there.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.367
The safety of that cake
is all I care about.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.667
- Well,
if I didn't care about you,

11:47.767 --> 11:49.500
I wouldn't leave you
in charge of my cake.

11:51.467 --> 11:52.633
- Okay.

11:52.733 --> 11:55.367
We need the new cake,
but we don't have the money.

11:55.467 --> 11:56.633
- I got it.

11:56.733 --> 11:59.100
We hire a hypnotist
to convince Mom she's a duck.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.867
And ducks don't have birthdays.

12:01.967 --> 12:04.500
This is where you say thank you.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.433
- They don't know.

12:08.533 --> 12:10.900
- Come on. Let's go.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.500
- I can't find her anywhere!

12:17.533 --> 12:19.667
- Found her.

12:19.767 --> 12:22.200
Aunt Mandy, our mom is like
the nicest person in the world.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.800
How could you possibly
be mad at her?

12:24.900 --> 12:27.267
- It was 23 years ago.
- Ah!

12:27.367 --> 12:29.700
- Your mother and I were part
of a struggling breakdance duo

12:29.800 --> 12:32.367
called
The Electric McBooger Babes.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.300
- Note to self,
build a time machine

12:34.400 --> 12:35.633
so I can go back
to Mom's high school

12:35.733 --> 12:37.867
and make fun of her
and her sister.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.900
- I booked us a huge gig.

12:40.067 --> 12:41.900
But my big sis bailed on me

12:42.067 --> 12:44.867
so she could go to some
random girl's cape ceremony.

12:44.967 --> 12:45.933
- Not cool, Mom.

12:46.067 --> 12:47.867
- Well,
it wasn't some random girl.

12:47.967 --> 12:51.100
It was my best friend. Cherry.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.233
- Mom--
- I'm making a point, Phoebe.

12:53.333 --> 12:55.500
- Apologize for what
you did to me.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.900
- Fine, I'm sorry for missing
one gig 20 years ago.

12:59.067 --> 13:00.567
- It's so much
more than that, Barb.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.667
- Fine, 23 years ago.

13:02.767 --> 13:06.767
- You still don't even see
what this is about, do you?

13:06.867 --> 13:09.700
And now you don't see me.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.967
- Mandy,
I wanted to stay out of this,

13:12.067 --> 13:15.100
but you leave me no choice!

13:18.067 --> 13:19.433
- Barb, do something
about your sister.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.900
- Oh, oh!

13:23.067 --> 13:23.967
- Okay.

13:24.067 --> 13:24.933
- MANDY: Oh, take that.

13:27.700 --> 13:31.333
- We'll handle this the way
I always did when I was a kid.

13:31.433 --> 13:33.533
- Ahhhh!

13:40.133 --> 13:41.467
- Oh, sorry, Phoebe,
your elbows won't fit.

13:41.567 --> 13:42.467
See ya!

13:44.633 --> 13:46.467
- Wait, nah--ah!

13:51.500 --> 13:54.100
- Yeah, Phoebe's safe.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.100
- Just take care of the slide.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.900
I already locked the door.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.367
- All right.
Now if she tries to slide down,

14:00.467 --> 14:03.067
she's gonna hit the--

14:03.133 --> 14:05.233
- MANDY: Didn't hurt.

14:05.333 --> 14:08.467
You can't hide in there forever,
Barbzilla.

14:08.567 --> 14:09.500
- She's right.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.700
We don't have any food.

14:14.967 --> 14:17.800
- You savages!

14:17.900 --> 14:19.100
- Relax,

14:19.200 --> 14:20.700
we're looking at the pile
of sandwiches behind you.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.433
- Oh, there's sandwiches.

14:22.533 --> 14:25.133
- *

14:28.600 --> 14:30.300
- Just let me know if you need
anything else, okay?

14:30.400 --> 14:32.467
I'm more than happy to get it.

14:32.567 --> 14:36.367
Ah, well, well, well,
look who's here.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.733
- My brother and I are ready
to be your Dessert Dummies.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.133
- I'm bored of that idea.

14:40.233 --> 14:41.933
I have a better one.

14:42.067 --> 14:47.167
I smash desserts
all over short stack here.

14:47.267 --> 14:49.967
- But our deal was for you to
smash dessert on Billy and me.

14:50.067 --> 14:53.733
- Sorry, that deal expired.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.367
- I got this, Nora.

14:57.133 --> 14:59.900
You are a duck.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.400
- *

15:03.500 --> 15:05.333
- Can we check
if Aunt Mandy's still upstairs?

15:05.433 --> 15:07.533
My room's starting to smell
like parents.

15:07.633 --> 15:09.067
- Why is she still
so mad at you, Mom?

15:09.133 --> 15:10.600
- I don't know.

15:10.700 --> 15:14.067
I already apologized for bailing
on the Electric McBooger Babes.

15:14.133 --> 15:15.833
I am so glad
I married into a better name.

15:15.933 --> 15:18.133
- Mm.

15:18.233 --> 15:19.733
- Your sister's clearly crazy.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.600
So what if you missed
one little performance?

15:21.700 --> 15:22.667
Let it go.

15:25.367 --> 15:26.933
I don't think
she should let it go.

15:27.067 --> 15:29.133
I don't think she's crazy.

15:29.233 --> 15:32.167
- MANDY: I'm licking
all your remotes!

15:32.267 --> 15:34.100
- You were saying.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.267
- You guys think
Aunt Mandy's mad

15:35.367 --> 15:36.800
about one little performance?

15:36.900 --> 15:39.067
She told you
it's way more than that.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.567
Her sister didn't show up
for something

15:40.667 --> 15:42.967
that was important to her,
and she's hurt.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.667
- MANDY: Now I'm licking
the door handles!

15:45.767 --> 15:47.233
Ahhhh!

15:48.400 --> 15:50.233
Hurt.

15:50.333 --> 15:53.100
And in a couple of days,
probably sick.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.200
- Well,
if it's really the problem,

15:54.300 --> 15:56.067
she should have just told me.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.133
- Well, maybe she's not
the touchy feely type

15:58.233 --> 16:00.067
who likes to talk
about her feelings, Mom.

16:00.133 --> 16:03.967
Maybe it's just easier
for her to fight it out!

16:04.067 --> 16:05.500
Now if you'll excuse me,

16:05.600 --> 16:07.867
I'm gonna go help Aunt Mandy
win this McBooger beef.

16:12.333 --> 16:15.967
- Guys...this might be crazy,
but I think

16:16.067 --> 16:18.567
when Max was talking
about Aunt Mandy,

16:18.667 --> 16:23.200
he was really
talking about himself.

16:23.300 --> 16:26.967
- Yeah, Dad, we got that part.

16:27.067 --> 16:28.433
Wow.

16:28.533 --> 16:30.067
Max isn't mad I ruined his gig.

16:30.133 --> 16:32.700
He's mad I didn't show up.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.933
He's really hurt.

16:34.067 --> 16:37.400
- Yeah, Phoebe,
we got that part.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.200
- Well, sometimes
people who seem the toughest

16:40.300 --> 16:42.500
are the ones
who are the most sensitive.

16:42.600 --> 16:48.500
- Oh, Barbara, you finally see
the real Dr. Colosso.

16:48.600 --> 16:52.067
- I just hope Max doesn't ruin
your birthday in 20 years.

16:52.133 --> 16:53.767
- Well,
it'll be his birthday, too.

16:53.867 --> 16:56.567
- Making a point, Phoebe!

16:56.667 --> 17:00.400
I just wish there was a way
to fix all this.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.200
- You know, maybe there's
still a little time left

17:03.300 --> 17:05.367
for some birthday magic.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.833
Ruby,
it's show time at the casino!

17:10.933 --> 17:14.067
- *

17:14.167 --> 17:17.367
- Ta-da!

17:20.933 --> 17:22.733
- *

17:22.833 --> 17:25.200
- Okay, so...

17:25.300 --> 17:26.667
you're gonna order a cream puff.

17:26.767 --> 17:29.333
And then I'll say,
"Eat this, you Dessert Dummy."

17:29.433 --> 17:31.567
And then kablamoo,
you get hit

17:31.667 --> 17:35.300
with that giant slingshot
full of cream.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.200
- On piles of money.

17:41.300 --> 17:42.800
And try to work in some tears.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.367
I want this to go viral.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.933
- Nora, I'm not sure about this.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.467
- I am. It's gonna be awesome.

17:54.267 --> 17:56.067
- Wait!

17:56.133 --> 17:58.533
Deena, we can't let you
kablamoo Chloe.

18:00.267 --> 18:02.200
- Because I wanna kablamoo her.

18:07.267 --> 18:09.400
- Chloe's the one
who got us into this mess.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.467
I wanna be part of the payback.

18:11.567 --> 18:13.500
- Older sister cream puffing
little sister?

18:13.600 --> 18:16.600
It's mean and cute,
just like me.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.067
Let's shoot it.

18:18.167 --> 18:21.233
All right, kid,
the pain will fade.

18:21.333 --> 18:25.233
But the Internet shame
will last forever.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.400
And...action.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.567
- Eat this, you Dessert Dummy!

18:34.733 --> 18:37.067
- Ah!

18:37.133 --> 18:39.533
That wasn't the deal.

18:41.567 --> 18:45.300
- Sorry, that deal expired.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.233
- Well, get the cake.

18:48.333 --> 18:49.567
- Good trick, Nora.

18:49.667 --> 18:50.733
- Thanks.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.300
- *

18:57.333 --> 18:59.300
- Okay, I'll cook
these popcorn balls

18:59.400 --> 19:00.433
with my heat breath.

19:00.533 --> 19:02.433
Then, I'll drop them
into my lair.

19:02.533 --> 19:04.933
Hopefully, we'll be able to hear
the sound of their screams

19:05.067 --> 19:07.300
over all the popping.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.167
- You're a sick kid.

19:10.267 --> 19:12.233
I like you.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.433
- Thanks, Aunt Mandy.
I like you, too.

19:14.533 --> 19:15.967
Now let's get popping.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.333
Thunder-tanium walls up.

19:18.433 --> 19:20.067
Revenge down.

19:35.067 --> 19:37.533
We are so much better
than everyone in our family.

19:37.633 --> 19:38.733
- It's pretty clever, guys.

19:38.833 --> 19:39.833
- Thanks, Phoebe.

19:39.933 --> 19:41.933
Phoebe!

19:42.067 --> 19:43.067
If you two are up here,

19:43.133 --> 19:45.233
then who's the girl down there
screaming?

19:45.333 --> 19:46.733
- Ah!

19:46.833 --> 19:48.267
Ah, oh!

19:48.367 --> 19:50.200
We made it, Ruby.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.267
Where is she? Ruby!

19:52.367 --> 19:53.667
I'm coming, Ruby!

20:00.533 --> 20:02.800
- Well, if you two
really wanna get back at us,

20:02.900 --> 20:04.933
you'll have to catch us.

20:05.033 --> 20:06.300
- I licked that doorknob!

20:06.400 --> 20:07.667
- I have telekinesis!

20:18.267 --> 20:19.500
Why's my band here?

20:19.600 --> 20:22.200
- Max...I'm sorry
I missed your gig.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.667
I should have been there.

20:23.767 --> 20:26.567
And I'm hoping this gig
makes up for it.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.733
- I didn't care
that you weren't there.

20:28.833 --> 20:29.833
- Just admit it.

20:32.367 --> 20:36.967
But if you wanna stay and watch,
I can't stop you.

20:37.067 --> 20:39.233
- All right, Max, let's rock.

20:39.333 --> 20:40.467
- Happy Birthday, Barb.

20:40.567 --> 20:43.600
You're one year hotter.

20:43.700 --> 20:48.133
Not cool-zen. That's a mom-zen.

20:48.233 --> 20:51.300
- Thank you,
strange German boy.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.333
- Mandy...

20:53.433 --> 20:55.400
I wanted to say sorry.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.667
You're my sister,

20:56.767 --> 20:59.033
and I shouldn't
have let you down.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.333
- That's all I ever wanted
to hear.

21:04.833 --> 21:08.900
There's only one thing
that could make this better.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.633
- Way ahead of you!

21:10.733 --> 21:14.867
- *

21:27.567 --> 21:30.067
McBoogers!
McBoogers! McBoogers!

21:30.133 --> 21:34.667
McBoogers! McBoogers! McBoogers!

21:34.767 --> 21:37.533
- Look, this candle's crocked.

21:37.633 --> 21:39.833
- That was close.
Now it's perfect.

21:39.933 --> 21:42.233
- *

21:45.367 --> 21:46.700
- Whoo! Yeah!

21:50.300 --> 21:51.967
- BOTH: No!

22:01.767 --> 22:04.067
- BOTH: We have a problem.

22:04.133 --> 22:05.767
- Yep.
