Well,
look at it this way.

37:02.434 --> 37:03.701
You've already
been shot at today,

37:03.769 --> 37:04.902
so how much worse
can this be?

37:04.970 --> 37:07.005
Are you kidding me?!

37:07.072 --> 37:08.339
A truck full of drugs?!

37:08.407 --> 37:10.575
What the hell did you get
yourself into this time?!

37:10.643 --> 37:12.477
Now, there's plenty of time
to go over that.

37:12.544 --> 37:14.646
Now, baby, I know you've got
things to get off your chest,

37:14.713 --> 37:17.682
and so does Evan,
but, uh...first things first.

37:21.253 --> 37:22.487
I'm sorry, ma.

37:25.524 --> 37:26.758
I don't even know
what to say.

37:26.825 --> 37:29.661
Well, that's funny,
'cause neither did he.

37:29.728 --> 37:31.663
That's why I brought this.

37:31.730 --> 37:34.399
Meet my friend --
el Ojo del Diablo.

37:34.466 --> 37:38.069
I met him when I was chasing
Noriega around Panama.

37:38.137 --> 37:40.538
Now, they have a tradition
in the villages down there.

37:40.606 --> 37:41.839
When there's a fight,

37:41.907 --> 37:43.808
both sides lock themselves
in a room,

37:43.876 --> 37:45.977
and they drink this
until they're bonkers.

37:46.045 --> 37:49.614
It helps them move
right past their differences.

37:49.682 --> 37:52.517
So you two are gonna spend
some quality time together.

37:52.584 --> 37:57.622
And nobody is leaving
until every drop is gone.

37:57.690 --> 37:58.523
Understood?

38:00.826 --> 38:04.028
Great! Salud!

38:04.096 --> 38:05.663
Ohh.

38:05.731 --> 38:07.398
You're welcome! Ahh!

38:25.084 --> 38:26.551
Hey, mom.
We stopped by the house.

38:26.618 --> 38:28.453
We brought you some food,
but you were out.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.787
So we left it
in the fridge.

38:29.855 --> 38:30.922
Madeline:
Thank you, Michael.

38:33.092 --> 38:34.692
Are you okay?

38:34.760 --> 38:37.028
Uh,
I think we should talk.

[ Woman sighs ]

39:01.720 --> 39:03.721
I hope you're not gonna ask me
to raise my hands.

39:03.789 --> 39:04.822
What the hell
are you doing here?

39:04.890 --> 39:06.557
Besides bleeding out
on your floor?

39:06.625 --> 39:08.726
I'm here to tell you
that I give up.

39:08.794 --> 39:10.461
You think
it's that simple?!

39:10.529 --> 39:11.863
You just killed my brother,
and --

39:11.930 --> 39:13.197
I didn't kill your brother,
Michael.

39:13.265 --> 39:14.632
Really? Who did?

39:14.700 --> 39:15.900
I don't know.

39:15.968 --> 39:17.969
I didn't trust the CIA
to leave me alone.

39:18.036 --> 39:20.738
I know it looks bad,
but I just wanted to disappear.

39:20.806 --> 39:22.607
Disappear?

39:22.674 --> 39:24.442
Disappear
before you killed Anson?!

Aah!

[ Groans ]

39:29.481 --> 39:31.649
I wanted to kill him
more than anybody on the planet,

39:31.717 --> 39:32.683
but I didn't.

39:32.751 --> 39:34.218
Convince me.

39:36.221 --> 39:37.889
I was still in Florida
when he died.

39:37.956 --> 39:40.258
I can tell you every restaurant
I ate in, ATM I used,

39:40.325 --> 39:42.660
and security camera that
would have caught me on tape.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.595
You could have hired someone
to pull the trigger for you.

39:44.663 --> 39:46.497
You think I'd hire some
random hitter to kill Anson?

39:47.866 --> 39:49.867
I just wanted
to find my brother

39:49.935 --> 39:52.270
and live the rest of my life
in peace.

are you, Michael?

You don't have to
believe me.

39:56.708 --> 39:59.610
Shoot me if you want.
But I'm not gonna run from you.

We're either good
or we're not.
