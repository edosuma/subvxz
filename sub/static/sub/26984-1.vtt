00:48.008 --> 00:50.743
- Bearian Starfish the Third,

00:51.985 --> 00:56.892
you will show the proper
respect in my courtroom

00:56.892 --> 00:58.062
just like

00:58.062 --> 01:00.063
everyone else.

01:00.990 --> 01:02.647
To your feet, sir.

01:07.807 --> 01:09.210
- What a crowd.

01:09.210 --> 01:10.882
Thank you, Bearia.

01:15.710 --> 01:17.543
- Order in this court.

01:18.700 --> 01:21.473
Please take your seat.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.393
Now, Bearian Starfish the Third,

01:29.170 --> 01:30.930
many here view you

01:30.930 --> 01:32.263
as a heroic

01:33.570 --> 01:34.403
figure,

01:35.483 --> 01:37.900
a great adventurer,

01:37.900 --> 01:39.630
and scientist

01:39.630 --> 01:44.441
who discovered a means to
harness the love energy.

01:46.857 --> 01:51.130
The one who led us space bears to victory

01:51.130 --> 01:53.591
in what seemed like

01:53.591 --> 01:54.424
a lost war

01:55.310 --> 02:00.310
with the Mizerbot Colony 12 cycles ago.

02:00.660 --> 02:03.294
- No need to thank me, sir.

02:06.925 --> 02:09.600
- There are others

02:09.600 --> 02:12.433
who say you are a scoundrel,

02:12.433 --> 02:13.266
a thief,

02:14.378 --> 02:15.211
a murderer

02:16.900 --> 02:20.350
who cheated his way to the top,

02:20.350 --> 02:22.950
and is solely motivated

02:22.950 --> 02:24.990
by his own financial gain.

02:27.729 --> 02:29.803
- That's not true, sir.

02:29.803 --> 02:32.438
I'm a self-made Space Bear.

02:32.438 --> 02:36.134
I wouldn't harm one one
tablet on a bornox Bearian.

02:39.998 --> 02:41.665
- Well, that may be,

02:43.150 --> 02:45.350
but you face

02:45.350 --> 02:50.350
serious charges of treason,
war crimes, and murder

02:50.720 --> 02:54.160
for your tole in the Zondyke Affair.

02:54.160 --> 02:58.183
How do you plead to these charges?

02:59.760 --> 03:01.304
- Not guilty, sir.

03:04.474 --> 03:06.150
- Well, Bearian,

03:06.150 --> 03:09.950
I could sentence you to 14 cycles

03:09.950 --> 03:12.390
of farming the slug pits

03:12.390 --> 03:15.240
of Beezlecar Seven.

03:15.240 --> 03:20.240
But the fact of the
matter is your planet, no,

03:20.560 --> 03:22.550
the entire universe

03:24.140 --> 03:25.090
needs

03:25.090 --> 03:26.077
your

03:26.077 --> 03:27.738
help.

03:27.738 --> 03:30.486
- I'm always here for the universe, sir.

03:36.540 --> 03:38.153
- As you know, Bearian,

03:39.260 --> 03:42.700
a growing problem with the
universe came to our attention

03:42.700 --> 03:44.859
some years ago.

03:44.859 --> 03:48.760
Some have yet to evolve
beyond the uselessness of war

03:48.760 --> 03:52.137
and needless suffering as
we have here on Bearia.

03:53.160 --> 03:58.160
There is a festering blackness
that grows stronger each day.

03:59.480 --> 04:03.460
It feeds off the hatred
and negative energy

04:03.460 --> 04:06.690
of this planet we call Earth,

04:06.690 --> 04:09.410
where man kills man

04:09.410 --> 04:14.042
and destroys all that he touches.

04:14.042 --> 04:17.213
- I know nothing of
this place called Earth.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.923
- Let me show you, Bearian.

05:34.430 --> 05:37.660
- How can those barbarians
live this way, sir?

05:37.660 --> 05:41.080
- Well, they have not yet
discovered the love energy

05:41.080 --> 05:43.130
and weapons of peace.

05:43.130 --> 05:45.390
They are destroying themselves,

05:45.390 --> 05:50.172
and perhaps the entire
universe, with their negativity.

05:50.172 --> 05:52.327
- But how can that be?

05:52.327 --> 05:56.880
- Our records indicate there
is a great black emptiness

05:56.880 --> 05:59.703
spreading out from the center
of the Milky Way Galaxy.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.880
It's size is doubling exponentially

06:04.770 --> 06:08.880
as it sucks up the never
ending supply of negativity

06:08.880 --> 06:10.233
from planet Earth.

06:11.170 --> 06:15.280
We predict that within 100 life cycles,

06:15.280 --> 06:17.800
it will have swallowed their planet

06:17.800 --> 06:21.820
and will be on our doorstep.

06:21.820 --> 06:24.490
We need your help, Bearian.

06:25.607 --> 06:27.661
- But what can I do?

06:27.661 --> 06:29.603
The Milky Way Galaxy must be at least

06:29.603 --> 06:33.077
10 million pinosars from our galaxy.

06:33.077 --> 06:35.233
It would take a lifetime to get there.

06:36.080 --> 06:40.360
- You are Bearia's greatest weapon expert,

06:40.360 --> 06:42.840
the inventor of the Love Bomb.

06:42.840 --> 06:47.163
That has made peace and
tranquility possible for us.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.650
We need you to travel to Earth

06:50.650 --> 06:52.780
and construct a Love Bomb there

06:52.780 --> 06:56.715
in order to detonate and
spread the love radiation

06:56.715 --> 06:58.960
throughout the planet.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.800
It is the only way to save our universe.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.710
Our scientists have come
up with a method of travel

07:05.710 --> 07:10.173
that will allow you to make
the trip in only three cycles.

07:11.250 --> 07:14.600
We now have a functioning worm hole

07:14.600 --> 07:17.743
that leads straight to the Milky Way.

07:19.410 --> 07:21.800
- So, I'll be able to get back?

07:21.800 --> 07:24.720
- You will have two Earth months

07:24.720 --> 07:28.210
once you arrive on the planet
to complete your mission.

07:28.210 --> 07:31.620
Our scientists won't be
able to keep the wormhole

07:31.620 --> 07:34.413
functioning any longer than that.

07:35.670 --> 07:38.250
I think if anyone

07:38.250 --> 07:41.413
is aware of the danger
involved, it would be

07:42.953 --> 07:43.786
you.

07:45.383 --> 07:47.146
- Where do I sign up?

08:15.231 --> 08:17.040
- We interrupt
your regularly scheduled

08:17.040 --> 08:18.930
programming for a special news alert

08:18.930 --> 08:20.590
from Space Bear News.

08:20.590 --> 08:23.470
Now, here's Bearia's
most trusted news anchor,

08:23.470 --> 08:25.600
Bearaldo Ribeara.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.690
- This morning, Bearian Starfish the Third

08:27.690 --> 08:30.300
prepares for his dangerous
journey to the Milky Way Galaxy.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.490
Bearian has been
undergoing intense training

08:32.490 --> 08:34.650
and environmental testing
for the past four weeks

08:34.650 --> 08:37.140
to get ready for the unknown
conditions of Planet Earth.

08:37.140 --> 08:39.380
Scientists have developed
a functioning wormhole

08:39.380 --> 08:41.520
that will transport Bearian to Earth.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.700
He will only have two months

08:42.700 --> 08:45.289
to assemble a Love Bomb
on Earth and detonate it.

08:45.289 --> 08:46.840
I am receiving word

08:46.840 --> 08:49.170
that Bearian is about
enter the wormhole now.

08:49.170 --> 08:51.360
Let's go to our action crew on location

08:51.360 --> 08:54.003
at the Honeycomb Scientific Test Site.

09:15.481 --> 09:16.898
- Whee!

09:18.960 --> 09:20.710
- Looks like Bearian made it, folks.

09:20.710 --> 09:22.230
All of here at Channel 5 News

09:22.230 --> 09:23.920
wish you the best of luck, Bearian.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.006
Long live the Space Bears.

10:26.127 --> 10:27.603
- Listen up, pussycat,

10:28.500 --> 10:31.500
it was your kind that came in
the night and killed my daddy.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.040
Ever since that day, I've been
hunting you down like dogs,

10:36.040 --> 10:39.487
and I want you to know just
why I'm gonna murder you.

10:41.830 --> 10:44.370
I got 25 kills behind me now,

10:44.370 --> 10:46.160
and you're just another notch in my belt,

10:46.160 --> 10:47.905
you dirty sack of fleas.

10:49.559 --> 10:53.160
I don't think today is
your lucky day, pussycat.

10:55.830 --> 10:56.840
This one,

10:56.840 --> 10:59.123
just like all the rest before my papa.

11:38.130 --> 11:41.450
Okay, today was your lucky
day after all, pussycat.

11:41.450 --> 11:42.690
And things ain't looking bad

11:42.690 --> 11:44.610
for old Ricky Gitsburg either.

11:44.610 --> 11:47.518
I think I just found
me a space rock, kitty.

11:47.518 --> 11:48.966
Whoo-hoo!

12:22.297 --> 12:24.418
- That's my stuff,

12:24.418 --> 12:27.679
and someone going to get
hurt if they're not careful.

12:27.679 --> 12:29.596
Someone gonna get hurt.

12:39.956 --> 12:41.706
Hey, that's my stuff.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.787
Good night, bunny rabbit.

13:11.612 --> 13:14.695
Little pansy's scared of a boom-boom.

13:59.319 --> 14:02.104
Hello, this is soft and fuzzy.

14:02.104 --> 14:03.437
He need my help.

14:22.423 --> 14:24.400
- Oh, no you don't, numbnuts.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.323
That thing's gonna make me a rich man.

14:40.510 --> 14:44.157
Dang it, I can't get a
clean shot from here.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.710
- Crap.

14:57.710 --> 14:59.410
We not gonna make it.

15:15.197 --> 15:17.373
- Just what are we dealing with, here?

15:41.263 --> 15:45.329
- All Soccer 9, this is
Agent Spears, come in.

15:45.329 --> 15:48.729
- This is All Soccer
9, read you loud and clear.

15:48.729 --> 15:49.680
Over.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.780
- Sir, the bear has landed.

15:51.780 --> 15:54.190
Repeat, the bear has landed.

15:54.190 --> 15:55.653
Yogi is in the house.

15:56.573 --> 15:57.947
- 10-4, Spears.

15:57.947 --> 16:00.900
Comprehend visitor at any cost.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.190
- As you wish, sir.

16:02.190 --> 16:03.113
Spears out.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.091
We'll find him, all right.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.360
- Oh, Ken, I like your laugh.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.610
You laugh with your eyes.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.390
- You know, when you're 100, I'll be 105.

16:52.374 --> 16:54.063
- I wanna die before you do, Ken.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.607
- Blue eyes say,

16:57.607 --> 16:59.640
"Love me or I die."

16:59.640 --> 17:02.070
Brown eyes say, "Love me or I kill you."

17:09.819 --> 17:11.750
- Oh Randy, you made it.

17:11.750 --> 17:16.079
Do you think Bobby Kennedy will
win the election this year?

17:16.079 --> 17:20.000
- It's Trump, Granny, the
orange coochie grabber.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.093
Bobby got shot.

17:22.329 --> 17:23.950
- Oh, heaven's no.

17:23.950 --> 17:27.230
I just saw Bobby on the TV yesterday.

17:27.230 --> 17:29.423
He's such a handsome man.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.843
He's gonna make a fine president.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.370
- Okay, Granny.

17:34.370 --> 17:35.877
Going to my room now.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.730
- Will you tell Gramps that
the grass is looking long,

17:40.730 --> 17:43.943
and he might want to get
his blower out tomorrow?

17:44.992 --> 17:46.773
- You know Gramps is long gone.

17:48.812 --> 17:50.173
- Gone where, honey?

17:52.760 --> 17:54.630
- Gone fishing, Granny.

17:54.630 --> 17:55.743
Fishing again.

17:57.189 --> 17:58.922
- Fishing again?

17:58.922 --> 18:01.870
Fishing?

18:01.870 --> 18:05.400
- She was a star
in her own little world.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.211
The girls loved her.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.500
I was sure she wouldn't give it up

18:08.500 --> 18:12.033
for anything in the world.

18:25.240 --> 18:26.910
- I gotta find that alien.

18:26.910 --> 18:28.320
It's my ticket to fame,

18:28.320 --> 18:31.533
and I'm not gonna let some
overgrown kid mess it up for me.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.663
If he gets in my way, he dies.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.083
Oh crap, I'm sorry, Valerie.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.193
You okay, baby?

18:51.078 --> 18:54.050
I know they're in this
area somewhere, baby.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.860
It's only matter of time.

18:55.860 --> 18:58.498
Ricky Gitsburg always catches his prey.

18:58.498 --> 18:59.331
Always.

19:25.980 --> 19:27.517
- Teddy is broken.

19:30.220 --> 19:31.923
What's wrong little buddy?

19:33.768 --> 19:34.851
- Queezlenax.

19:36.568 --> 19:37.485
Queezlenax.

19:39.321 --> 19:40.766
- Guidoneck?

19:40.766 --> 19:42.349
What's a guidoneck?

19:45.047 --> 19:46.163
- Queezlenax.

19:49.925 --> 19:50.842
Queezlenax.

19:53.070 --> 19:55.360
- Oh, you hungry?

19:55.360 --> 19:56.933
You mean you eat bees?

20:00.073 --> 20:01.156
- Queezlenax.

20:05.910 --> 20:08.200
- So, I understand.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.480
I'll be right back.

20:12.928 --> 20:17.928
- Queezlenax.

21:34.675 --> 21:35.748
Queepo Jango.

21:45.781 --> 21:47.031
- Queepo Jango.

22:49.220 --> 22:50.340
- Uh-oh.

22:50.340 --> 22:52.850
Looks like the cat's out
of the bag on this one.

22:52.850 --> 22:55.240
Well, I hope you piggies
are ready to eat some bacon,

22:55.240 --> 22:56.920
'cause Ricky Gitsburg is about to feed you

22:56.920 --> 22:59.127
your own behinds for dinner.

23:16.179 --> 23:18.262
These guys are good.

23:30.125 --> 23:32.422
Holy crap, there it is!

23:49.107 --> 23:50.963
It's a fricking teddy bear.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.053
- All right, Gitsburg,
you're coming with us.

24:01.277 --> 24:02.683
- Kiss my grits, pig!

24:15.200 --> 24:18.210
- Come in, HQ, we just
had a confirmed sighting.

24:18.210 --> 24:20.980
Repeat, Smokey just started a fire.

24:20.980 --> 24:22.483
We have sighted the visitor.

24:46.770 --> 24:48.300
- Why they shooting?

24:48.300 --> 24:49.573
What I do now?

24:58.960 --> 25:00.653
- You're in over your head, kid.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.890
- Ow!

25:17.890 --> 25:19.583
Never do that again.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.560
I know a safe place.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.393
Follow me.

- Zo Jappa Zee.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.463
- I'll teach you how to
talk with the big book.

28:06.176 --> 28:07.839
- I'm going to need your help.

28:07.839 --> 28:10.347
The future of the
universe is in our hands.

28:11.235 --> 28:12.621
- Man,

28:12.621 --> 28:13.454
you smart.

28:36.330 --> 28:40.060
- So, Ricky, you want to
tell us what's going on here?

28:40.060 --> 28:41.920
- I wanna call my lawyer.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.410
I have rights like anybody else.

28:44.410 --> 28:46.440
- That's true, you got rights.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.360
But that doesn't mean we
have to respect those rights.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.460
Now you're gonna tell us what you saw,

28:51.460 --> 28:53.320
or we're gonna start cutting off fingers

28:53.320 --> 28:54.793
until you change your mind.

28:55.630 --> 28:58.690
Who is the kid, and where is the alien?

28:58.690 --> 29:02.010
- Buzz off and die, pig, I ain't talking.

29:02.010 --> 29:03.747
- Have it your way.

29:10.280 --> 29:13.400
- Come on, guys, I don't
know any more than you do.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.970
I saw the alien crash, but the kid ran off

29:15.970 --> 29:17.820
before I could even get there.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.830
Can't we work something out?

29:19.830 --> 29:22.350
- We're gonna work it
out all right, Ricky.

29:22.350 --> 29:24.064
You belong to us now.

29:31.477 --> 29:33.970
- Yes sir, what's the situation?

29:33.970 --> 29:36.270
- We're gonna need some
medics up here pronto.

29:36.270 --> 29:38.900
And tell them to bring a
Sham-Wow, or something,

29:38.900 --> 29:40.847
'cause we gotta big mess.
- Yes sir.

29:42.130 --> 29:43.813
- You'll burn for this, Spears!

29:52.940 --> 29:55.103
- You never told me your name.

29:56.210 --> 30:00.083
- Well, I'm Bearian Starfish
the Third in your language.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.510
Bearian for short.

30:02.510 --> 30:06.210
I am a Space Bear of the planet Bearia.

30:06.210 --> 30:07.580
- Okay.

30:07.580 --> 30:08.853
My name's Randy.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.973
I'm a guy of planet Earth.

30:13.940 --> 30:15.241
- I know.

30:15.241 --> 30:17.430
We have a lot of work to do, Randy.

30:17.430 --> 30:19.543
We're going to need some plutonium.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.289
- Plutonium?

30:22.289 --> 30:24.380
Uh, huh?

30:24.380 --> 30:26.740
- We're also going to need a car battery,

30:26.740 --> 30:30.950
a satellite dish, a chainsaw, gunpowder,

30:30.950 --> 30:32.050
and a shortwave radio.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.600
- Where we gonna get all that?

30:35.600 --> 30:36.713
- I'm not too sure, Randy.

30:36.713 --> 30:38.920
It seems I have powers on your planet

30:38.920 --> 30:41.510
that I did not have on my own planet.

30:41.510 --> 30:45.373
I just can't use them too
much, or I will get very sick.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.760
- I don't want you to get sick.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.570
You're my only friend.

30:50.570 --> 30:53.603
I will help you, Space Bear, I promise.

30:55.140 --> 30:56.260
- Thank you, Randy.

30:56.260 --> 30:58.190
You are my only friend here on Earth.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.400
We have to stick together.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.110
Now that we've been sighted,

31:02.110 --> 31:04.660
bad people will be looking for us.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.240
We have to be careful.
- Yeah,

31:07.240 --> 31:09.053
'cause we're making a boom-boom.

31:10.635 --> 31:12.020
- That's right, Randy.

31:12.020 --> 31:15.470
We will construct a Love
Bomb, and its love radiation

31:15.470 --> 31:19.374
will save your planet
and the entire universe.

31:19.374 --> 31:20.622
Hopefully.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.702
Who?

32:59.702 --> 33:00.697
- Dog.

You know, he captures the bad
guys and has a funny mullet.

33:11.568 --> 33:12.634
Ouch!

33:12.634 --> 33:15.467
I think I just got stung by a bee.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.730

34:01.730 --> 34:03.430
I'm just gonna pick up some stuff.

34:12.940 --> 34:14.092
That weird.

34:14.092 --> 34:16.833
Granny's always here watching her stories.

34:29.578 --> 34:30.877
Oh no!

34:30.877 --> 34:32.313
Not Granny!

34:33.440 --> 34:35.230
- This is my fault, Randy.

34:35.230 --> 34:38.550
I will help you get
Granny back, don't worry.

34:38.550 --> 34:40.010
- Thanks Bearian.

34:40.010 --> 34:42.600
I will you help you build a Love Bomb.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.560
We're friends forever.

34:44.560 --> 34:48.043
- Friends forever.

34:55.060 --> 34:59.417
Okay, now let's see if we can
save the world and Granny too.

35:00.460 --> 35:02.933
- Okay, let's do it, Space Bear.

35:33.820 --> 35:35.690
- We're gonna have to
break in here tonight

35:35.690 --> 35:38.107
to get a hold of some plutonium.

35:38.107 --> 35:40.970
- Gonna be a long night, Bearian.

35:40.970 --> 35:42.475
I will get my things.

36:30.052 --> 36:31.280
- Gitsburg.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.430
- Hello, Ricky.

36:32.430 --> 36:34.850
We have some information
that the boy and alien

36:34.850 --> 36:38.320
are planning to break into
Crosspatch Nuclear Plant tonight.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.880
I'm gonna have 10 of
my best men down there,

36:40.880 --> 36:44.028
and I want you on my team.
- Right.

36:44.028 --> 36:46.840
- Do whatever necessary
to capture the alien,

36:46.840 --> 36:48.840
but he must be taken alive.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.750
We will have Granny at the plant tonight

36:50.750 --> 36:52.940
as a little incentive.

36:52.940 --> 36:54.730
- This is getting crazy, Spears.

36:54.730 --> 36:56.960
I don't like hurting innocent people.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.130
- No one's gonna get hurt

36:58.130 --> 37:00.510
unless we fail in stopping the alien.

37:00.510 --> 37:01.620
We have reason to believe

37:01.620 --> 37:03.410
the visitor is attempting to construct

37:03.410 --> 37:05.420
weapons of mass destruction.

37:05.420 --> 37:08.740
This is a matter of national security.

37:08.740 --> 37:11.110
- I don't care about your weapons, Spears.

37:11.110 --> 37:12.760
It's personal now.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.410
That alien will be coming with me tonight,

37:15.410 --> 37:17.201
that I can guarantee.

37:17.201 --> 37:20.330
- Just make sure he comes in
alive and in one piece, Ricky,

37:20.330 --> 37:22.490
or there's gonna be
some harsh consequences,

37:22.490 --> 37:23.690
if you know what I mean.

37:26.460 --> 37:29.349
- Alive or dead, don't
make no difference to me.

38:04.125 --> 38:05.993
- They got guns.

38:05.993 --> 38:07.500
They got peek-a-boos, too.

38:08.440 --> 38:09.740
- Yes Randy.

38:09.740 --> 38:11.650
It seems there's no way in.

38:11.650 --> 38:14.720
Just remember, that things
look darkest just before

38:14.720 --> 38:16.143
it all goes pitch black.

38:17.630 --> 38:19.973
- You sure know English good now.

38:21.290 --> 38:23.450
- I've been experimenting, Randy.

38:23.450 --> 38:25.610
It seems I can do things on this planet

38:25.610 --> 38:27.984
that were impossible on my planet,

38:27.984 --> 38:31.410
like sending out the energy surges.

38:31.410 --> 38:34.565
- Yeah, and the bubble.

38:34.565 --> 38:36.960
- Yes, like the force field bubble.

38:36.960 --> 38:39.690
Take my hand, Randy, and close your eyes.

38:39.690 --> 38:40.873
I'll get us inside.

38:43.850 --> 38:45.560
Randy, look in my eyes.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.637
We must focus on love for each other.

38:50.637 --> 38:53.790
Love is the source of all my power.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.290
I love you, Randy.

38:56.532 --> 38:59.032
- I love you, too, Space Bear.

39:16.295 --> 39:18.810
- Sir, Yogi is in the house.

39:18.810 --> 39:21.096
Repeat, Yogi's in the house.

39:44.990 --> 39:46.260
- Wait out here, Randy.

39:46.260 --> 39:48.880
The radiation inside will kill you.

39:48.880 --> 39:49.993
- Okay, Bearian.

39:50.991 --> 39:52.515
Be careful.

40:00.117 --> 40:04.700
- Put this in your backpack,
and let's get out of here.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.755
- You okay, Bearian?

40:40.123 --> 40:41.710
- Come on out, boy.

40:41.710 --> 40:43.810
Hand over the alien, and no one gets hurt.

40:44.887 --> 40:48.452
- Over my dead body, dirtbag.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.227
- You don't know who you're
messing with, numbnuts.

41:27.480 --> 41:28.313
Gotcha!

42:03.970 --> 42:05.770
- All right, show's over.

42:05.770 --> 42:07.123
The alien comes with us.

42:10.629 --> 42:11.462
- Granny!

42:20.574 --> 42:22.677
- These men are bad, Randy.

42:22.677 --> 42:25.313
Don't let me stand in the way.

42:25.313 --> 42:27.813
Save yourself and your friend.

42:28.925 --> 42:29.925
- No Granny!

42:39.348 --> 42:40.681
- Zowie!

42:44.313 --> 42:46.896
No!

42:56.709 --> 43:00.126
No!

43:16.570 --> 43:18.250
- Cease fire, cease fire!

43:18.250 --> 43:20.310
Stop wasting bullets, you morons.

43:20.310 --> 43:21.163
They're gone.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.550
Get this pansy to a doctor, will ya.

43:26.550 --> 43:28.890
And get somebody up here with a Sham-Wow.

43:28.890 --> 43:30.869
This place is a mess.

44:00.326 --> 44:03.187
- Not Granny, not Granny.

44:03.187 --> 44:04.104
Not Granny!

44:05.613 --> 44:08.770
- It's going to be okay, Randy.

44:08.770 --> 44:09.790
Don't worry.

44:09.790 --> 44:12.703
The Love Bomb is our only
hope to set things right.

44:39.270 --> 44:41.100
- Gitsburg will have to be disposed of

44:41.100 --> 44:43.460
once we have the alien in custody.

44:43.460 --> 44:44.950
He knows too much.

44:44.950 --> 44:47.180
We'll have to make it
look like an accident.

44:47.180 --> 44:48.410
In the meantime,

44:48.410 --> 44:50.993
I want everyone working
around the clock on this.

44:51.870 --> 44:54.340
- We have several reports of break-ins

44:54.340 --> 44:56.090
and thefts from junkyards,

44:56.090 --> 45:00.029
electronic stores, hardware
stores, you name it, sir.

45:00.029 --> 45:02.290
- I'm aware of that, Agent Smiley.

45:02.290 --> 45:03.870
If I didn't know any better,

45:03.870 --> 45:06.397
I'd say this alien is
trying to build a nuke.

45:06.397 --> 45:08.137
Time is of the essence.

45:08.137 --> 45:10.270
Somebody get Ricky on the horn,

45:10.270 --> 45:12.630
and tell him that if he
doesn't find that space bear

45:12.630 --> 45:14.070
by the end of the week,

45:14.070 --> 45:17.240
I'm gonna bring a hammer
straight down on his juevos.

45:17.240 --> 45:18.920
Now let's get to work.

45:36.840 --> 45:39.630
- I have everything I need
now to build a Love Bomb,

45:39.630 --> 45:41.853
but it will take time to assemble.

45:43.190 --> 45:45.330
We need to find a desolate place

45:45.330 --> 45:48.385
with no people to set off the Love Bomb.

45:48.385 --> 45:50.833
The explosion will be massive.

45:50.833 --> 45:53.630
Do you know of a place like this?

45:53.630 --> 45:56.420
- My daddy is from a place called Wyoming.

45:56.420 --> 45:59.580
Granny says there's nothing
there but sheep shagging,

45:59.580 --> 46:01.700
whatever that is.

46:01.700 --> 46:03.670
- Wyoming, yes.

46:03.670 --> 46:05.610
I have read of this land,

46:05.610 --> 46:09.010
the land of sheep shaggers, as you say.

46:09.010 --> 46:13.110
We must leave for Wyoming once
the Love Bomb is complete.

46:13.110 --> 46:14.440
- Okay, Bearian.

46:14.440 --> 46:15.747
I'll go with you.

46:15.747 --> 46:18.633
- I'm so sorry about Granny, Randy.

46:19.659 --> 46:21.220
- It's okay.

46:21.220 --> 46:22.243
It's not your fault.

46:23.358 --> 46:26.380
- We can make it right, I promise.

46:26.380 --> 46:27.703
You'll have to trust me.

46:28.860 --> 46:30.770
- I trust you, Bearian.

46:30.770 --> 46:33.300
We stick together no matter what.

46:33.300 --> 46:37.740
- That's right, we're all
we have no matter what.

46:37.740 --> 46:38.743
- No matter what.

46:40.412 --> 46:42.410
- I need you to leave now, Randy.

46:42.410 --> 46:44.973
It won't be safe for you
here while I'm working.

46:46.460 --> 46:49.863
- Okay, I'll be right
outside if you need me.

47:44.641 --> 47:47.940
- Don't worry, Randy, it's not on.

47:47.940 --> 47:50.470
- What is this thing, Bearian?

47:50.470 --> 47:55.470
- It is my own invention I
created on my home world Bearia.

47:55.893 --> 47:57.850
It brought peace to my people,

47:57.850 --> 48:00.530
and now will bring peace to yours.

48:00.530 --> 48:03.060
It's called the Love Bomb.

48:03.060 --> 48:05.066
- How does it work?

48:05.066 --> 48:06.483
- It is a nuclear device,

48:07.360 --> 48:10.550
but I determined how to
restrain the destructive energy

48:10.550 --> 48:12.000
released by detonation,

48:12.000 --> 48:15.680
and to filter it in a way
that produces a radiation

48:15.680 --> 48:17.603
charged by love.

48:17.603 --> 48:18.520
Once detonated,

48:18.520 --> 48:21.580
the love radiation will
spread across the Earth,

48:21.580 --> 48:24.980
and all humans and animals
will live in peace.

48:24.980 --> 48:28.417
Things will be set right
again in your world.

48:28.417 --> 48:30.990
Then the great blackness in the universe

48:30.990 --> 48:34.053
will shrink to nothing,
and we will all be saved.

48:35.070 --> 48:38.867
- Okay Bearian, how do
we get it to Wyoming?

48:38.867 --> 48:41.517
- I won't be able to teleport both of us

48:41.517 --> 48:44.453
and the bomb without causing
great damage to myself.

48:45.590 --> 48:48.550
We're going to need a
helicopter, or something.

48:48.550 --> 48:49.650
There isn't much time.

48:50.890 --> 48:52.673
- A whirly bird?

48:52.673 --> 48:54.548
- A whirly bird.

49:07.868 --> 49:09.500
- Gitsburg, get in here.

49:09.500 --> 49:11.933
What are you waiting for, an invitation?

49:18.230 --> 49:20.070
You really screwed up this time, Ricky.

49:20.070 --> 49:21.030
Look at you.

49:21.030 --> 49:22.063
You're a mess.

49:23.430 --> 49:24.820
- Kiss my grits, Spears.

49:24.820 --> 49:26.510
Where were you when I needed you?

49:26.510 --> 49:29.813
You guys sat around and let
that imbecile cut off my hand.

49:31.190 --> 49:33.360
I'm done with you and
your band of gorillas.

49:33.360 --> 49:34.909
I want out.

49:34.909 --> 49:37.204
- Well, you're useless to us now, anyway.

49:37.204 --> 49:42.204
Unfortunately, it's
not gonna be that easy.

49:42.598 --> 49:44.684
- What do you think you're doing?

49:44.684 --> 49:47.801
We had a deal, Spears.

49:47.801 --> 49:52.051
- That's right, Ricky, we had
a deal, but you screwed it up.

49:52.051 --> 49:54.486
You didn't really think
we would let you walk out

49:54.486 --> 49:57.626
with everything that you know, did you?

49:57.626 --> 49:59.696
We're gonna put you on ice for a while,

49:59.696 --> 50:01.806
until I decide what to do with you.

50:01.806 --> 50:03.669
Take him out of here.

50:07.472 --> 50:09.868
- This ain't gonna work
out well for you, Spears.

50:09.868 --> 50:12.312
I'm not gonna forget this.

51:20.394 --> 51:22.648
I'm done with you and
your band of gorillas.

51:22.648 --> 51:24.066
I want out.

51:24.066 --> 51:26.437
- Well, you're useless to us now, anyway.

51:26.437 --> 51:30.020
Unfortunately, it's
not gonna be that easy.

51:32.632 --> 51:34.019
- What do you think you're doing?

51:34.019 --> 51:35.852
We had a deal, Spears.

51:36.892 --> 51:38.745
- We're gonna put you on ice for a while,

51:38.745 --> 51:40.762
until I decide what to do with you.

51:40.762 --> 51:42.512
Take him out of here.

51:43.694 --> 51:45.921
- This ain't gonna work
out well for you, Spears.

51:45.921 --> 51:48.184
I'm not gonna forget this.

52:10.688 --> 52:12.271
- Randy, it's time.

52:13.792 --> 52:15.436
- Time for what?

52:15.436 --> 52:17.910
- I think I know how to move the bomb.

52:17.910 --> 52:19.760
We must act fast.

52:19.760 --> 52:22.353
I did some research on Ricky Gitsburg.

52:22.353 --> 52:26.550
He was a helicopter pilot for
the military a long time ago

52:26.550 --> 52:27.963
in a place called Vietnam.

52:29.260 --> 52:34.128
He will be the one to get us
to Wyoming with the Love Bomb.

52:34.128 --> 52:36.382
- But that guy hates us, Bearian.

52:36.382 --> 52:38.049
He tried to kill us.

52:38.998 --> 52:39.831
- Yes, he hates us, but he
hates the government more now.

52:43.690 --> 52:46.450
I believe he will help us
if we can break him out.

52:46.450 --> 52:49.600
The FBI is holding him in isolation

52:49.600 --> 52:52.170
at the headquarters due east of here.

52:52.170 --> 52:54.490
It won't be easy,

52:54.490 --> 52:58.420
but he's the one who will
help us save the universe.

52:58.420 --> 53:01.493
Let's get our things together,
there isn't much time.

53:02.540 --> 53:04.127
- Okay, Bearian,

53:04.127 --> 53:05.210
I'm with you.

53:28.935 --> 53:31.438
- Come on, Randy, let's be quick.

53:31.438 --> 53:34.251
Ricky's cell is straight down this way.

53:53.525 --> 53:54.673
This is it.

53:54.673 --> 53:58.673
Stand back, Randy, I've
never tried this before.

53:59.597 --> 54:04.597
- What are you gonna do?

54:22.920 --> 54:25.540
- Well, I'll be a son of
a toothless street walker.

54:25.540 --> 54:26.733
Not you again.

54:28.030 --> 54:29.570
- Let's go.

54:29.570 --> 54:30.673
Bearian is hurt.

54:31.660 --> 54:34.790
- Well, I guess beggars
can't be choosers, boy.

54:34.790 --> 54:37.110
I surely ain't gonna stay out here,

54:37.110 --> 54:38.896
or I'm dead for sure.

54:51.169 --> 54:52.919
- Which way, Bearian?

54:54.735 --> 54:58.325
- Turn right at the end of this hallway.

54:58.325 --> 55:01.467
That will lead us to the helipad.

57:52.330 --> 57:53.413
- Shoot, kid.

58:02.966 --> 58:03.951
- Great

58:03.951 --> 58:05.167
Caesar's

58:05.167 --> 58:06.000
ghost!

58:34.890 --> 58:36.860
- What am I getting into, here?

58:36.860 --> 58:38.515
Where to?

58:38.515 --> 58:41.093
- The land of Wyoming.

58:41.093 --> 58:42.670
- Yeah, but first we gotta pick up

58:42.670 --> 58:45.043
something from the tree house.

58:46.350 --> 58:48.300
- Well, I guess I owe you one.

58:48.300 --> 58:50.830
Looks like we're heading to Wyoming, boys.

58:50.830 --> 58:52.563
Hold on to your butt.

59:41.649 --> 59:43.439
- Where are we?

59:43.439 --> 59:45.720
- This is the Killpecker Sand Dunes

59:45.720 --> 59:47.699
in the Red Desert of Wyoming.

59:47.699 --> 59:50.503
9,000 square miles of nothing.

59:50.503 --> 59:52.203
Think that'll work, Yogi?

59:53.358 --> 59:56.074
- Yes, this will work fine.

59:56.074 --> 59:57.680
Let's get the Love Bomb assembled

59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.356
before Spears catches up to us.

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.653
- You sure this thing is safe?

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.763
I mean, what good is
it to save the universe

01:00:30.763 --> 01:00:32.763
if we blow up the Earth doing it?

01:00:34.255 --> 01:00:37.130
- Maybe the universe would
be better off without Earth.

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:41.930
It was here that all the trouble started.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:46.120
- Why you arrogant little furball.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.040
- We don't have time to argue, Ricky.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.840
The nearest towns are over 100 miles away,

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.857
according to my chart.

01:00:53.857 --> 01:00:58.085
The bomb will only have
a 20-mile blast radius.

01:00:58.085 --> 01:01:01.303
We will singe the
ground, but nothing more.

01:01:02.414 --> 01:01:05.220
Any love radiation will
be carried by the wind

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.053
to all the parts of the globe.

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:10.850
We're going to need to seek safe shelter

01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:13.123
before we detonate it.

01:01:13.123 --> 01:01:14.360
- Why not blow it

01:01:15.275 --> 01:01:17.025
from the whirly bird?

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:21.907
- Yes Randy, that's what I was thinking.

01:01:23.092 --> 01:01:26.373
- Well, stop y'all's
squawking and let's get to it.

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:29.940
20-mile radius, huh?

01:02:31.083 --> 01:02:33.138
- Something went wrong.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:57.933
- Spears here.

01:02:58.811 --> 01:03:00.098
Huh?

01:03:00.098 --> 01:03:01.313
You got to be kidding.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.940
- Calling the first nuclear
attack on U.S. soil.

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.660
The bomb was detonated near
the Killpecker Sand Dunes

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.610
in the Wyoming Red Desert.

01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:11.460
Just seconds ago,

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.470
Homeland Security declared
it a terrorist attack.

01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:17.090
The military is scrambling to
get a handle on the situation

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:18.023
as we speak.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.253
- I'm not through with you yet, Gitsburg.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.373
Why am I always the last to know?

01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:29.160
Roger, the whole world's gone
to hell in a hand basket,

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.413
and no one tells me.

01:03:30.413 --> 01:03:32.040
You guys need to take your thumbs

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.540
out of your manholes up there.

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:37.000
Call in everything we got.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.423
We're gonna need military
intervention on this.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.490
Someone's gotta inform the
Pentagon about what's going on.

01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:45.890
We have to stop this
alien before it kills us.

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:46.733
Now, get moving!

01:03:55.858 --> 01:03:57.620
- What have I done?

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.090
- You blew up Wyoming.

01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:01.990
Now, we're probably all gonna
die from radiation exposure.

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:09.990
- My instruments show
safe levels of radiation.

01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:12.733
It was just the blast was
much greater than expected.

01:04:14.013 --> 01:04:16.180
The laws of nature are
much different on Earth

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.920
than on my planet.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.857
I must have miscalculated something.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.910
- Ya think?

01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:24.853
You took out a whole state, buddy.

01:04:26.056 --> 01:04:27.530
- It was a goof.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:28.693
It's not his fault.

01:04:29.590 --> 01:04:32.193
- Pretty big goof, numbnuts.

01:04:32.193 --> 01:04:33.377
- Please stop fighting.

01:04:33.377 --> 01:04:36.170
We need to get out of this desert.

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:39.410
I don't have much power
left, and we're out of honey.

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:42.020
I will try to teleport
the three of us home,

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.683
but it will drain me completely.

01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:46.267
- You will die.

01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:48.853
- It's okay, Randy.

01:04:48.853 --> 01:04:51.603
I think I can take one more jump.

01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:27.683
- I don't know where we
are, but it sure ain't home.

01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:32.130
Oh great.

01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:34.693
We're in Ari-fricking-zona.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.074
- Shut up, dirtbag.

01:05:38.074 --> 01:05:38.907
Bearian is hurt.

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:43.063
What do we do now, Bearian?

01:05:44.431 --> 01:05:46.361
- I don't know, Randy.

01:05:46.361 --> 01:05:47.444
I don't know.

01:05:52.776 --> 01:05:54.940
- I'll tell you what to do.

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.273
Start walking.

01:05:57.690 --> 01:05:59.350
- You dirty traitor.

01:06:01.432 --> 01:06:02.990
- Shut up, numbnuts.

01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:04.925
Now start walking.

01:06:30.527 --> 01:06:32.610
I really wanted to believe you,

01:06:32.610 --> 01:06:34.900
but you showed me, didn't you?

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:38.020
Now, move away from the
alien, or so help me,

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.020
I'll blow a hole right
through your empty head

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.143
to get to him.

01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:44.373
That thing is a menace, and it ends now.

01:06:45.332 --> 01:06:47.683
- Go ahead and shoot, Ricky.

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:51.040
- Have it your way, numbnuts.

01:07:08.162 --> 01:07:10.680
I remember you, pussycat.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.247
Bring it on!

01:07:26.233 --> 01:07:27.066
Uh-oh.

01:08:11.862 --> 01:08:12.779
- What now?

01:08:14.529 --> 01:08:15.362
- We walk.

01:08:30.299 --> 01:08:32.676
- Wish we brought snacks.

01:08:32.676 --> 01:08:34.624
- Yes, and honey.

01:08:34.624 --> 01:08:37.219
I am too weak to teleport us.

01:08:37.219 --> 01:08:38.969
- It's okay, Bearian.

01:08:40.345 --> 01:08:43.212
Where there's a will, there's a way.

01:08:43.212 --> 01:08:45.148
- I hope so, Randy.

01:09:05.712 --> 01:09:07.212
- It tastes nasty.

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:10.470
- It's better than nothing.

01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:11.888
Let's me try one.

01:09:23.801 --> 01:09:25.969
Oh, I feel strange, Randy.

01:09:29.548 --> 01:09:31.086
- Me too, Bearian.

01:09:31.086 --> 01:09:32.336
You look funny.

01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:37.518
- You look funny, too.

01:09:57.813 --> 01:09:58.646

- Somewhere out there.

01:11:54.261 --> 01:11:55.511
I miss my home.

01:11:56.784 --> 01:11:57.617

01:12:41.006 --> 01:12:42.400
- Bearian,

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.773
we have been tracking your progress.

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.640
Have no fear.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.373
All is not lost.

01:12:50.812 --> 01:12:52.382
- But I have failed.

01:12:52.382 --> 01:12:56.110
I have only brought even
more destruction here.

01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:59.290
- It is not your fault, Bearian.

01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:02.350
Our scientists have
worked out a new formula

01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:03.560
for the Love Bomb

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.003
that is compatible with
Earth's energetic field.

01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:10.383
I will grant you this knowledge.

01:13:14.178 --> 01:13:17.210
- I knew it was something
with the hydrocarbons.

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:18.550
- Yes.

01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:19.938
- I can fix this.

01:13:19.938 --> 01:13:21.953
- But it won't be easy.

01:13:23.086 --> 01:13:25.450
You only have two days left

01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:27.970
until the wormhole closes forever.

01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:32.610
If that happens,

01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:36.240
we will not be able to
get you home for at least

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.520
one

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:38.353
hundred

01:13:38.353 --> 01:13:39.293
earth years.

01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:41.803
- Great.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.847
- It is imperative

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.983
that you accomplish this
mission, or the universe is lost.

01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:56.220
Even now, the great blackness

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.610
creeps upon the doorstep

01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:01.227
of Planet Bearia.

01:14:03.077 --> 01:14:07.530
- I won't let the good Space
Bears of Planet Bearia down.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:10.413
I will complete this
mission even if it kills me.

01:14:11.663 --> 01:14:13.123
- Take this.

01:14:14.247 --> 01:14:16.847
It is the Crystal of Baldus.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:23.680
This crystal has been passed
down in your family for years,

01:14:25.059 --> 01:14:29.193
specifically for a day like this.

01:14:30.403 --> 01:14:31.613
- How do I use this?

01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:34.553
- When the time is right,

01:14:35.576 --> 01:14:40.576
clutch the crystal, and focus
all your love energy into it.

01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:45.973
It will help you when no one else can.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.520
I must send you off now.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:53.610
Take this honey so that
you will be full power

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.523
when you awake.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.810
- Thank you, Grand Inquisitor.

01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:01.273
I will do my best.

01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:03.510
- Your planet

01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:06.370
and the whole

01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:08.123
entire

01:15:09.044 --> 01:15:10.660
universe

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:13.243
is depending on you, Bearian.

01:15:15.356 --> 01:15:16.189
Never

01:15:17.055 --> 01:15:17.888
lose

01:15:19.062 --> 01:15:19.895
hope.

01:15:37.357 --> 01:15:39.763
- I dreamed of big blue bunnies.

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:45.053
- Yes, I had strange dreams also, Randy.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.490
- How did we get up here?

01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:49.433
What now?

01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:52.650
- We must try one more time.

01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:55.140
If we fail, all hope is lost.

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.800
- The alien has been spotted
a few miles from here

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.844
near the town of Willborough.

01:16:12.844 --> 01:16:14.320
We believe he is heading for the Goodwills

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.900
and Man nuclear power plant

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:19.467
to attempt another atomic detonation.

01:16:19.467 --> 01:16:21.512
We're not gonna let that happen.

01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:24.510
The future of America
is in our hands today.

01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:26.399
Now, fall out.

01:17:10.454 --> 01:17:12.210
- I am sorry for this.

01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:13.673
There is no time to explain.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:18.260
Everyone must exit the plant
now for their own safety.

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:21.060
If there is any resistance,
my friend and I will have

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:23.992
no choice but to blow the place sky high.

01:17:23.992 --> 01:17:26.920
Please exit the building
in an orderly manner.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.053
We are here to save the universe.

01:17:41.696 --> 01:17:42.830
Okay.

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:44.833
Looks like everyone's out.

01:17:44.833 --> 01:17:46.833
Come on, buddy, we don't have much time.

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:51.900
- If we don't make it,
Bearian, just know I love you.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.773
Granny was all I had,
and now it's just you.

01:17:56.414 --> 01:17:58.390
- I love you, too, Randy.

01:17:58.390 --> 01:18:00.340
Don't worry, we will fix this,

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:03.703
or my name's not Bearian
Starfish the Third.

01:18:16.219 --> 01:18:17.350
- Better hurry.

01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:19.324
The boom-boom is coming.

01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:42.948
- Let's go, Randy.

01:18:42.948 --> 01:18:45.209
We're gonna have to make a run for it.

01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:13.320
- Show's over, boys.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.960
Drop that detonator now.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.320
We know what you are up to.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.153
Comply!

01:20:21.555 --> 01:20:22.388
Fire!

01:20:26.935 --> 01:20:27.768
- Ow!

01:20:38.198 --> 01:20:43.198
You're my only friend.

01:20:45.787 --> 01:20:50.787
- No!

01:21:15.251 --> 01:21:16.759
- Cease fire, cease fire!

01:21:16.759 --> 01:21:18.525
What the yee-haw heck?

01:21:23.402 --> 01:21:25.069
Kill the alien, now!

01:21:43.478 --> 01:21:46.228
Yeah!

01:24:04.343 --> 01:24:05.860
- Hey Bill,

01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:08.163
I gotta tell you something, man.

01:24:09.026 --> 01:24:10.103
- What is it, Ted?

01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:13.103
- I love you.

01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:14.813
- Nah, man.

01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:18.521
I love you more.

01:24:30.345 --> 01:24:31.853
- What's happened?

01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:34.293
You okay?

01:24:36.621 --> 01:24:37.666
- Randy!

01:24:37.666 --> 01:24:39.579
You're alive!

01:24:39.579 --> 01:24:42.104
- Yeah, but I feel all weird.

01:24:42.104 --> 01:24:44.062
- I think it worked, Randy.

01:24:44.062 --> 01:24:44.895
Look.

You're alive!

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.293
- Randy, boy, I can remember everything.

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.810

Oh, Randy, I couldn't
have done it without you.

01:25:35.538 --> 01:25:39.403
- We will always stick
together no matter what.

01:25:40.838 --> 01:25:43.263
- That's right, no matter what.

01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:47.800
I only have 30 minutes left
before the wormhole closes,

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.350
and I'm stuck here permanently.

01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:52.627
- You can stay, Bearian.

01:25:52.627 --> 01:25:55.950
- I miss my home and my family, Randy.

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:57.963
But I'll never make it in time.

01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:00.990
- You need a ride, Space Bear?

01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:03.798
I got a F-16 with your name on it.

01:26:03.798 --> 01:26:06.940
- Can you get me back to
the original crash site?

01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:08.796
There is no time to waste.

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:11.530
- We'll get you there with time to spare.

01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:12.483
Come on.

01:26:38.210 --> 01:26:40.040
- This is as close as you can come

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.807
without endangering yourself, Randy.

01:26:42.807 --> 01:26:46.048
Thank you so much for all your help.

01:26:46.048 --> 01:26:49.769
The good Space Bears will
hear of your heroics.

01:26:49.769 --> 01:26:52.065
- Take me with you, Bearian.

01:26:52.065 --> 01:26:53.732
I don't fit in here.

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.293
- I wish I could, Randy,

01:26:56.293 --> 01:27:01.293
but the wormhole is calibrated
for Space Bears, not humans.

01:27:01.578 --> 01:27:04.219
Every atom in your body would explode

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:07.630
simultaneously if you try to enter.

01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:09.797
- I guess this is goodbye.

01:27:11.302 --> 01:27:13.133
- Goodbye, Randy.

01:27:13.133 --> 01:27:16.147
I will come back, someday, I promise.

01:27:24.887 --> 01:27:25.970
Love forever.

01:27:26.934 --> 01:27:28.184
- Love forever.

01:27:30.995 --> 01:27:31.912
- Whoo-hoo!

01:27:59.878 --> 01:28:02.015
Well, don't just stand there gawking.

01:28:02.015 --> 01:28:03.810
I just saved the universe.

01:28:03.810 --> 01:28:06.502
Let's get this party started.

01:28:06.502 --> 01:28:08.502
- The universe is saved!

01:28:10.194 --> 01:28:11.652
All hail

01:28:11.652 --> 01:28:13.902
Bearian Starfish the Third.

01:28:15.718 --> 01:28:17.217
