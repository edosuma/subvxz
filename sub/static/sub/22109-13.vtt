19:50.066 --> 19:52.199
Well, we may not be ethical,

19:52.234 --> 19:53.934
but we're a great team.

19:53.969 --> 19:56.270
Just like Fred and Ethical.

19:56.305 --> 19:57.805
LISA: Want to tell us
how Maggie was born?

19:57.840 --> 19:59.273
HOMER: We told you that story.

19:59.308 --> 20:01.608
- LISA: And how we got the dog?
- HOMER: Found him at Christmas.

20:01.644 --> 20:04.477
- LISA: And the origin of the cat?
- HOMER: Nobody cares.

20:04.992 --> 20:07.487
This was a nice idea, Homie. [SIGHS]
_

20:07.717 --> 20:09.217
I'm glad we came back here.

20:09.252 --> 20:10.485
Just the two of us.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.987
- [HONKING]
- [BARKING]

20:13.022 --> 20:14.922
[SCOFFS] Just imagine what they'd do

20:14.958 --> 20:16.991
if Grampa wasn't watching them.

20:17.026 --> 20:19.260
- I wish I'd never had kids.
- [GRUNTING]

20:19.295 --> 20:22.263
Thank God there's no munitions
left in the factory.

20:22.298 --> 20:23.598
Never too late for another!

20:23.633 --> 20:25.867
No one's made it out in a half century!

20:25.902 --> 20:27.902
I didn't even know
there were five of us!

20:27.971 --> 20:29.937
[ALL EXCLAIMING]

20:33.443 --> 20:34.876
Make room! What the...?

20:34.911 --> 20:36.544
How did you get in here?

20:36.579 --> 20:38.179
Mind your own business.

20:38.690 --> 20:43.894
