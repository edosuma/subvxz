00:38.580 --> 00:40.582
Jesse?

00:41.583 --> 00:44.086
Jesse?

00:45.087 --> 00:47.089
Jesse... Jesse,
can you hear me?

00:50.592 --> 00:51.593
Jesse, please!

00:52.594 --> 00:54.054
Jesse!

00:54.096 --> 00:56.598
Jesse Matthews,
six years old.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.059
Is this an old photo?

00:59.101 --> 01:00.561
Yeah, it's the only one
the mom had.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.604
She said one minute, he's
on the swing, the next minute,

01:02.646 --> 01:04.063
he's gone.
Abduction.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.107
Well, the search radius
is over a mile.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.650
No sign of the boy.

01:06.650 --> 01:07.901
What about the father?

01:07.943 --> 01:09.069
The father is, um...

01:09.111 --> 01:11.864
Army Sergeant, uh,
Dwight Matthews.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.575
Killed in Afghanistan
four years ago.

01:14.616 --> 01:17.119
Any other family members?
Grandparents? Boyfriends?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.662
No, her parents
are dead,

01:18.662 --> 01:20.080
and her husband's
parents-

01:20.122 --> 01:22.624
she lost communication
with them since he died.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.628
Mrs. Matthews...
this is Gil Grissom

01:26.670 --> 01:29.131
and Warrick Brown
from the Crime Lab.

01:30.132 --> 01:32.593
I, uh... I never bring
Jesse to the park,

01:32.634 --> 01:35.137
but this afternoon, the
backyard just couldn't hold him,

01:35.179 --> 01:40.142
so we came here and... uh...
he was on the swings.

01:40.184 --> 01:41.643
I couldn't even
get him off.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.104
And then I look around,
and he's gone; he's just...

01:44.146 --> 01:48.650
Mrs. Matthews, there's really
nothing more you can do here.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.153
Why don't you let us
give you a ride home?

01:51.195 --> 01:53.155
I'm not leaving.

01:54.156 --> 01:56.658
Not without Jesse.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.666
I called the team.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.669
They always look so vulnerable.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.670
They are.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.640
? Who... are you??

02:19.681 --> 02:22.434
? Who, who, who, who??

02:22.476 --> 02:25.145
? Who... are you??

02:25.187 --> 02:27.189
? Who, who, who, who??

02:27.231 --> 02:29.483
? I really wanna know?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.652
? Who... are you??

02:31.693 --> 02:33.654
? Oh-oh-oh?
? Who...?

02:33.695 --> 02:37.199
? Come on, tell me who are you,
you, you?

02:37.241 --> 02:40.702
? Oh, you!?

02:45.707 --> 02:47.709
It's like trying to get
an I.D. on swimmers

02:47.751 --> 02:49.211
from ripples
in the pool.

02:49.253 --> 02:50.170
How about you?

02:50.212 --> 02:53.215
Lots of little fingers...

02:53.257 --> 02:54.967
and some big ones.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.718
Helping hands?

03:24.246 --> 03:25.747
Here, ma'am,
look at this picture.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.499
Do you remember
this boy?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.251
It's not a recent photo.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.212
I had my hands full.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.256
I don't take my eyes
off him ever.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.215
Sure. I understand.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.217
But there was this
man near the swings-

03:37.259 --> 03:41.263
he kept looking around like
he was waiting for something.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.723
What'd he look like?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.766
He was a white guy,
blue baseball cap...

03:44.808 --> 03:45.726
That's all
I remember.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.769
Did he seem interested
in one of the kids?

03:47.811 --> 03:50.230
Yeah- a boy.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.274
Could be that boy.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.277
It's hard to tell.
Okay...

03:55.319 --> 03:56.236
Thank you.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.779
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.239
I know, honey.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.283
It's time to go.
Let's go home.

04:01.325 --> 04:02.743
Mrs. Matthews...

04:02.784 --> 04:04.286
you know, I know
this is difficult for you,

04:04.328 --> 04:05.287
but I have
to ask you again-

04:05.787 --> 04:07.039
do you remember
seeing anyone

04:07.080 --> 04:08.248
hanging around
near the swings?

04:08.290 --> 04:12.794
Anyone? Maybe... maybe a man
in a blue baseball cap?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.260
Yes.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.303
Can you describe him?

04:21.345 --> 04:22.304
He was white...

04:22.346 --> 04:23.764
White...

04:23.805 --> 04:26.308
Uh... just under
six feet, I think.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.809
Six feet. Great.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.311
Jeans.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.566
Did he take Jesse?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.818
We don't know.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.346
Our K-9 officers
are going to need

05:04.388 --> 05:06.348
something
that Jesse's worn recently.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.809
Um... his jacket.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.352
It's in the car.
I'll get it for you.

05:14.857 --> 05:15.858
Okay, boy, ready?

05:15.899 --> 05:17.317
Seek!

05:17.359 --> 05:19.361
Find it, find it!

05:21.864 --> 05:23.365
Let's go. Come on.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.889
Whoa! Whoa!
What are they doing?

05:46.930 --> 05:47.890
Pull the dogs
back, please.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.892
Down, girl, down. Heel.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.394
Can I see this jacket?

05:57.399 --> 05:59.401
Has Jesse ever worn this?

05:59.902 --> 06:00.861
I just bought it for him.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.905
He's been growing so fast.
I'm-I'm sorry, I...

06:02.946 --> 06:04.907
That's okay; we'll get
something from your house.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.939
What do you make of this?

06:38.941 --> 06:40.400
Possible struggle...

06:40.442 --> 06:43.445
That could've been used
as a weapon.

06:43.487 --> 06:44.446
The blood drops
could be

06:44.947 --> 06:46.949
castoff.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.465
Maybe the poor kid had to pee
while his mom was in the car.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.977
Mrs. Matthews, I
need you to take

07:15.018 --> 07:16.478
a look at something.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.980
Do you recognize these?

07:22.484 --> 07:24.486
They're...

07:40.502 --> 07:42.004
Mrs. Matthews inside?

07:42.504 --> 07:43.463
Yeah.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.507
Every mother's
worst nightmare.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.761
I checked her answering
machine- no calls.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.014
Well, I'll get a DNA exemplar
for Jesse

07:52.055 --> 07:54.016
and let her get some sleep.

07:54.057 --> 07:54.975
She won't sleep.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.019
Okay, Greg, let's do a little
legwork- what do you say?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.478
You take this side
of the street;

07:58.520 --> 08:00.022
I'll take the other-
find out if anybody's

08:00.063 --> 08:01.523
seen anything suspicious.

08:29.051 --> 08:31.053
Mrs. Matthews?

08:37.558 --> 08:39.061
Mrs. Matthews?

08:40.562 --> 08:43.565
I'm Catherine Willows
from the Crime Lab.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.567
Sorry about the mess.

08:46.068 --> 08:46.568
It's okay.

08:47.069 --> 08:50.072
Jesse was so full of
energy this morning.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.574
He didn't give me time
to clean up.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.826
I understand.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.204
This photo-

08:57.246 --> 08:59.540
is it recent?

08:59.581 --> 09:02.584
Uh, yeah, that's, uh...
that's from last month.

09:02.626 --> 09:05.587
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to borrow it.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.339
I'll get it
to Nevada Child Search,

09:07.381 --> 09:09.091
and they can get it out
to the media.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.050
Sure.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.093
Thank you.

09:15.097 --> 09:17.099
Jesse's home-schooled.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.103
We do art together...
music...

09:21.144 --> 09:23.605
everything.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.611
Do you have children?

09:29.653 --> 09:32.573
I have a daughter, 13.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.575
"Thirty-six and a half inches. "

09:34.616 --> 09:38.120
I'll add that
to the physical description.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.580
And, Mrs. Matthews,

09:39.621 --> 09:41.623
our K-9 Unit
will need something

09:41.665 --> 09:42.875
with Jesse's scent.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.126
Oh, right, right.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.129
Um... maybe... maybe
his-his stuffed dinosaur?

09:47.171 --> 09:49.131
He holds it while
he's sleeping.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.091
That'll work.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.635
And I will need something
with his DNA:

09:53.677 --> 09:55.137
a toothbrush, hairbrush,

09:55.179 --> 09:56.597
pillowcase...

09:56.638 --> 09:58.098
Why do you need that?

09:58.140 --> 10:00.642
Well, if we locate anything
that could lead us to him,

10:00.684 --> 10:03.395
we want to make sure
we've got the right boy.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.148
Well, I'll-I'll get
those things for you.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.150
Thank you.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.621
Hi.
Hey.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.664
Captain Brass asked me
to drive the lady's car home.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.124
Oh... okay.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.167
Yeah, I'll let her know.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.668
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

10:50.692 --> 10:51.693
Since her husband died,

10:52.194 --> 10:54.196
kids' toys always
laying around.

10:54.238 --> 10:56.156
I'm always
tossing balls

10:56.198 --> 10:58.158
over my fence back
into her yard

10:58.200 --> 11:01.203
They keep to themselves,
which is fine by me.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.205
Sir, have you seen
any suspicious cars

11:03.247 --> 11:05.165
in the neighborhood,
or strangers?

11:05.207 --> 11:07.709
I work all day,
and I don't spend my nights

11:07.751 --> 11:09.211
looking at the neighbors, okay?

11:09.253 --> 11:10.712
Well, what about the weekends?

11:12.714 --> 11:14.967
Aggressive little pooch.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.593
Oh, she's my sweetie.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.178
Who's my good girl?

11:18.220 --> 11:20.722
Queenie's my
good girl.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.183
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

11:23.225 --> 11:25.227
Interesting how things work out.

11:25.269 --> 11:26.687
What do you mean?

11:26.728 --> 11:28.480
Her kid getting killed.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.232
See, this
is Queenie.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.735
My last dog, Princess...

11:34.236 --> 11:37.239
Princess died, and she did it.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.991
Karen Matthews?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.701
Four years ago,

11:40.742 --> 11:43.495
I found Princess
hanging off the back fence.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.873
Supposed to look
like it was an accident,

11:45.914 --> 11:48.250
like she got caught
on her collar and choked.

11:48.292 --> 11:49.751
Did you see her do this?

11:49.793 --> 11:50.711
No,

11:50.752 --> 11:53.255
but I knew.

11:53.755 --> 11:56.258
See, Princess used to bark
through the fence at her kid.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.760
She just
wanted to play.

11:59.261 --> 12:02.264
If you ask me,
you know what?

12:02.306 --> 12:03.223
The kid liked it,

12:03.265 --> 12:05.726
but Karen- she just
went off the deep end.

12:05.767 --> 12:09.271
Mr. McCracken...
who told you her son was killed?

12:35.797 --> 12:37.549
Who takes care of the hamsters?

12:37.591 --> 12:39.301
Jesse... when he remembers,

12:39.801 --> 12:41.762
which is about
as often

12:41.803 --> 12:44.306
as he remembers
to brush his teeth.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.769
Mrs. Matthews,

12:48.810 --> 12:49.811
has Jesse ever run
away from home?

12:49.853 --> 12:52.314
Oh, he'd never do that.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.817
Was he upset
about anything?

12:55.859 --> 12:58.278
No. No. No.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.072
You're going to find him.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.823
If something
happened,

13:01.865 --> 13:03.825
I'd know.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.330
I'd know here.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.332
Of course. I'd feel the same.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.336
Mrs. Matthews,
when the officer

13:14.378 --> 13:15.295
brought your
car back,

13:15.337 --> 13:18.340
I noticed that there were gifts
in the garage that were

13:18.382 --> 13:20.843
from your
husband's parents.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.847
The, um...
the colonel

13:25.347 --> 13:26.807
and his wife-

13:26.849 --> 13:28.851
we're, uh... we're
not in touch anymore.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.103
Ever since

13:31.144 --> 13:33.313
Dwight was...

13:33.355 --> 13:34.815
Ever since Dwight died,

13:34.857 --> 13:38.360
my father-in-law thinks he
should be raising Jesse, not me.

13:38.402 --> 13:40.863
He runs that house
like an Army barracks.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.866
Do you know
what that does to a boy?

13:43.907 --> 13:45.325
Well, I saw
what it did

13:45.367 --> 13:48.370
to Dwight, and I willnot
let him do that to Jesse.

13:48.412 --> 13:51.373
I'm still going to need
some contact information.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.378
They took him.

14:46.887 --> 14:53.894
We haven't seen Karen
or Jesse since, um... uh...

14:55.395 --> 14:56.355
...since...

14:56.396 --> 14:58.649
We haven't seen
them in four years,

14:58.690 --> 15:00.901
since the day we buried our son.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.407
Here. Here's
your toy soldier.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.165
Warren, not today.

15:15.207 --> 15:16.375
He's my grandson.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.377
It-it's... it's a toy.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.921
I will raise my own son...
not you.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.884
Jesse comes from a...

15:25.926 --> 15:29.680
from a long line
of military men,

15:29.721 --> 15:33.433
going all the way
back to Bull Run.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.185
Were you in
the service?

15:35.227 --> 15:36.895
Yes, sir. Marine Corps.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.397
I bet your dad
was, too, right?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.440
You know, we're here to talk
about your family, not mine.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.401
If we hadn't seen

15:42.442 --> 15:45.404
Jesse's picture
last night on TV,

15:45.445 --> 15:47.447
we wouldn't know
what he looked like now.

15:47.489 --> 15:48.907
She blames me.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.200
I do not.
Don't tell me

15:50.242 --> 15:51.451
what I know and don't know,

15:51.493 --> 15:52.911
all right?

15:52.953 --> 15:54.454
Can I please just go
to the bathroom?

15:54.496 --> 15:55.956
Oh, absolutely.
Sure. Absolutely.

15:55.998 --> 15:56.915
Where is it?

15:56.957 --> 16:00.419
It's, uh... down the hall

16:00.460 --> 16:01.962
to the right,
through the door.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.463
Excuse me.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.969
This is just between

16:09.011 --> 16:11.430
you and me.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.473
I saw Karen last week.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.437
Oh, hi, Karen.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.479
Uh, could I see Jesse,

16:19.521 --> 16:20.439
please?
No.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.983
Karen, he's my
only grandson.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.443
You can't have him, okay?

16:24.484 --> 16:25.944
I don't want to
keep him, Karen.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.487
I just want to give
him these. Please.

16:27.529 --> 16:28.447
Just leave us alone.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.990
Jesse, it's Grandpa! Jesse! No, please!

16:32.492 --> 16:34.495
Colonel?

16:38.499 --> 16:39.958
Where's my wife?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.003
She's in the ladies' room.
It's okay.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.756
Do you get these, uh...

16:45.797 --> 16:48.467
these spells often?

16:48.509 --> 16:50.010
There's some
memory loss?

16:53.514 --> 16:55.766
It's early Alzheimer's.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.976
That's a tough one.

16:58.018 --> 17:01.522
All I wanted was
to see my grandson.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.984
Find him for me.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.029
We'll do our best, sir.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.031
We'll do our very best.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.535
Any luck from those prints

17:14.576 --> 17:15.493
from the swing?

17:15.536 --> 17:18.038
Nothing on AFIS, but Brass
did put out a bulletin

17:18.079 --> 17:19.540
for the guy
in the blue baseball cap.

17:19.580 --> 17:20.790
I wouldn't get
our hopes up.

17:20.833 --> 17:21.916
It's a vague
description.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.042
What about the K-9 search?

17:23.085 --> 17:24.044
Nothing.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.005
What do you got for me?

17:27.047 --> 17:29.049
Well, I ran
the exemplar toothbrush

17:29.091 --> 17:30.300
against a blood sample

17:30.342 --> 17:31.677
from the men's room.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.011
It's not a match.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.012
What about the underpants?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.056
Couldn't get enough
epithelials for DNA,

17:36.098 --> 17:37.558
'cause the kid
probably hadn't

17:37.599 --> 17:39.309
been wearing them
for very long.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.019
I wonder why. Well, I did confirm

17:41.061 --> 17:43.564
a positive result for
urea in the underpants,

17:43.605 --> 17:45.065
and the quantity
and distribution

17:45.107 --> 17:46.817
suggests that, um,

17:46.859 --> 17:48.527
the kid wet himself.

17:48.569 --> 17:50.571
Ditched his wet
tighty-whiteys

17:50.612 --> 17:52.573
and went back
out to play.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.076
I got a hit on your blood.
Conner Daly.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.078
Convicted of NRS 201.450.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.580
Out on parole.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.039
What's a 450?

18:01.081 --> 18:03.083
That'd be
"sex with a dead body."

18:07.588 --> 18:12.593
Mr. Daly, where were
you yesterday afternoon?

18:12.634 --> 18:15.345
Playing nickel slots
downtown.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.472
I, uh... I'm
not trying to win

18:17.514 --> 18:19.600
the big jackpot
or anything.

18:19.641 --> 18:22.352
Just passing time.

18:22.394 --> 18:25.063
It, uh... relaxes me.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.608
Well, where'd
you go next?

18:27.649 --> 18:29.610
Walk in the park.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.111
Fresh air.

18:31.612 --> 18:34.114
I'm allergic to smoke.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.073
Which park?

18:35.115 --> 18:37.117
One near my apartment.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.121
Would that be Mesa Valley Park?

18:41.163 --> 18:42.080
Yeah.

18:42.122 --> 18:45.083
Then I sat down on a park bench.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.128
I read a copy of theRJ
that I picked out of the trash.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.087
What's this about?

18:49.129 --> 18:51.131
Did you go to the
men's room at any time?

18:51.173 --> 18:53.383
Only when nature called.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.511
What'd you do there?

18:55.552 --> 18:57.596
I amused myself.

18:57.638 --> 18:59.598
And what'd you do next?

18:59.640 --> 19:03.143
We found your blood
on the floor.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.395
I, uh, uh... I get nosebleeds.

19:05.437 --> 19:07.606
Too much cocaine
back in the day.

19:07.648 --> 19:11.151
I'm sure we'll find that
on your medical records.

19:17.658 --> 19:20.619
My whole damn life
is on record,

19:20.661 --> 19:22.663
so why don't you look
at the freakin' records, huh?

19:22.704 --> 19:25.165
You have anger
issues, Mr. Daly?

19:27.167 --> 19:29.169
Yeah.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.673
Would you take a
seat for me, please?

19:41.181 --> 19:42.432
What's that cut

19:42.474 --> 19:43.642
on your hand from?

19:43.684 --> 19:44.685
You pick the
wrong partner?

19:45.686 --> 19:47.187
No.

19:55.195 --> 19:58.198
Look, I'll send
the county a buck 50.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.200
They can buy a new one.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.206
You recognize this boy?

20:09.209 --> 20:11.712
Looks like a kid that this guy
brought into the bathroom,

20:11.753 --> 20:13.463
but I didn't stay to watch.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.215
Did you get a look at the guy?

20:17.217 --> 20:18.719
51s fan.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.181
His cap.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.224
Las Vegas police
may have a break

20:24.266 --> 20:25.726
in the case of a missing boy.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.186
An eyewitness has come forward

20:27.227 --> 20:29.229
with a more complete
description of the suspect.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.690
Authorities are
now seekingthisman

20:31.732 --> 20:34.234
in connection with the
disappearance yesterday

20:34.276 --> 20:35.986
of six-year-old
Jesse Matthews.

20:36.028 --> 20:37.696
Initial reports from the scene

20:37.738 --> 20:41.241
only mention a man in a blue
cap, but the police artist

20:41.283 --> 20:42.701
had a lot more to work with

20:42.743 --> 20:44.703
after the eyewitness
came forward.

20:44.745 --> 20:48.749
Uh, uh... I'm ju... I'm just
trying to stay positive,

20:48.790 --> 20:51.251
and, um, you know,
I know that Jesse'll

20:51.293 --> 20:53.212
be safe at home
again soon, so...

20:53.253 --> 20:54.755
Do you feel
that there's anything else...

20:54.796 --> 20:55.756
I know he'll be safe.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.759
The boy's mother, Karen,
is holding out hope

20:58.800 --> 21:00.511
that she'll see her son again.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.262
She's seen tragedy enough.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.222
Four years ago,

21:03.263 --> 21:07.267
she lost her husband
in combat in Afghanistan.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.272
So, what's going on?

21:19.279 --> 21:20.531
Sorry. Declined again.

21:20.572 --> 21:21.782
You have another card?

21:21.823 --> 21:23.242
Aw, come on.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.243
That's the
fourth time.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.786
Maybe we got
identity theft-ed or something.

21:25.828 --> 21:27.746
Hey, hey,
leave that candy alone.

21:27.788 --> 21:28.789
It could be the
card-reader.

21:28.831 --> 21:29.748
My manager'll
be right back.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.041
If you guys want
to get some coffee,

21:31.083 --> 21:32.292
it's on the house.
All right, let's go.

21:32.793 --> 21:34.253
Las Vegas Police.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.295
You're under arrest.
What?

21:35.796 --> 21:36.797
That's the kid from
the news, right?

21:36.839 --> 21:38.257
Yeah. You did good.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.258
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

21:39.299 --> 21:41.301
Hey, let go of me! What are
you arresting us for, huh?

21:41.343 --> 21:42.803
What's going on? What
are you arresting us for?!

21:43.303 --> 21:44.054
Get away from him!

21:44.096 --> 21:44.930
Get away
from him!

21:44.972 --> 21:46.139
It's all right, son.

21:46.181 --> 21:47.307
You're safe now.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.270
Oh, God, where is he?

21:51.311 --> 21:52.813
He's in with
a social worker. He's okay.

21:52.855 --> 21:54.314
Jesse!

21:54.815 --> 21:56.817
Oh, Jesse, thank God.

21:56.859 --> 21:58.569
Thank God you're okay.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.279
No, no, no, it's okay.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.822
Mommy is here.
You're safe now.

22:01.864 --> 22:02.281
Mommy!

22:02.322 --> 22:04.283
Mommy! Mommy!
Adam! Adam!

22:04.324 --> 22:06.076
No, no, Mommy's
here, honey.

22:06.118 --> 22:07.452
Get away
from my kid!

22:07.494 --> 22:08.787
What did they say to you?

22:08.829 --> 22:10.581
What did they make you say,
sweetheart?

22:10.622 --> 22:12.332
Look at me.
Don't say nothing to nobody.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.792
You hear me,
little man, huh?

22:13.834 --> 22:15.794
Don't look
at those people.

22:15.836 --> 22:17.337
Just look at me.
Just look right here.

22:17.379 --> 22:18.797
Jim?

22:18.839 --> 22:19.798
What the hell's going on?

22:19.840 --> 22:21.341
Yeah, that's, uh,
Victor and Valerie Esposito.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.844
Transplants from Jersey.

22:23.886 --> 22:25.345
Check this out.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.098
It was with
Mrs. Esposito's

22:28.140 --> 22:29.725
personal belongings
at booking.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.351
He's got the same scar

22:31.852 --> 22:35.355
over his eye
as in Karen's photos.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.316
So this kid has two moms?

22:37.357 --> 22:38.859
King Solomon threatened
to cut the baby in half.

22:38.901 --> 22:39.818
What are you going to do?

22:39.860 --> 22:42.362
King Solomon didn't have
a DNA lab.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.826
Here you go, sweetie.

22:47.868 --> 22:51.872
Hey, is it all right
if he goes with CSI Brown

22:51.914 --> 22:52.873
for a little while?

22:52.915 --> 22:53.874
It won't be long.

22:55.876 --> 22:57.836
Okay.

22:57.878 --> 22:59.129
Hey, my name's Warrick.

22:59.171 --> 23:00.380
You want to go for a walk?

23:02.883 --> 23:04.384
It's okay, sweetheart.

23:04.426 --> 23:05.385
He's a friend.

23:06.887 --> 23:09.139
Come on, we'll have some fun.

23:09.181 --> 23:11.391
Oh, uh, wait. He gets cold.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.393
Thanks.

23:14.895 --> 23:16.897
Thank you.

23:31.495 --> 23:34.998
Wow, everybody's so
busy in there, huh?

23:35.040 --> 23:37.501
Hey, I hear
you like dinosaurs.

23:37.543 --> 23:40.003
Which one's
your favorite?

23:42.005 --> 23:43.507
You know
what mine is?

23:44.007 --> 23:49.513
T- Rex... 'cause he's got
teeth, like, this big.

23:50.514 --> 23:52.015
I bet you
wouldn't want him

23:52.057 --> 23:53.016
for a pet, would you?

23:55.519 --> 23:58.021
You want to see
something cool?

23:58.063 --> 24:01.024
Come over here. Sit down.

24:05.529 --> 24:08.532
This is my special
science kit.

24:08.574 --> 24:11.076
Got all kinds of stuff in here.

24:11.118 --> 24:13.537
Let me see...
I got rubber gloves.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.040
Here...

24:17.541 --> 24:18.500
put that on.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.043
What else I got in here?

24:20.085 --> 24:21.044
I got pens

24:21.545 --> 24:22.546
that turn into flashlights.

24:26.049 --> 24:28.552
You want to see
something invisible?

24:29.052 --> 24:30.554
Go like this.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.560
See, there's
nothing there, right?

24:36.602 --> 24:37.519
But take

24:37.561 --> 24:40.022
my magic wand right here,

24:40.063 --> 24:42.566
and I put it
in my special magic powder

24:42.608 --> 24:45.110
like this.

24:45.152 --> 24:47.112
Watch this.

24:47.154 --> 24:49.031
What appears

24:49.072 --> 24:51.033
is our fingerprints.

24:51.074 --> 24:54.077
Try to shine
the flashlight on it.

24:55.579 --> 24:58.040
Wow. Good job.

24:58.081 --> 24:59.583
You could be my assistant.

25:03.086 --> 25:06.590
See, no two people's
fingerprints are alike,

25:06.632 --> 25:08.091
just like
no two people's spit

25:08.133 --> 25:09.551
is the same.

25:09.593 --> 25:11.595
So if I took
my spit...

25:13.096 --> 25:15.098
...like this...

25:17.601 --> 25:18.602
Now you do it.

25:22.606 --> 25:25.108
See, even if
I mix them up,

25:25.609 --> 25:28.612
I have a machine to tell me
which one is mine

25:28.654 --> 25:29.613
and which one is yours.

25:32.115 --> 25:34.117
Now, I need you
to tell me something.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.121
Which one of these

25:38.163 --> 25:39.623
two pretty ladies

25:39.665 --> 25:41.416
is your mom?

25:41.416 --> 25:43.126
That one.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.590
Thank you.

25:48.632 --> 25:49.883
Yeah, whatever.

25:49.925 --> 25:51.134
Can I see Adam now?

25:52.636 --> 25:53.595
Adam?
Yeah.

25:53.637 --> 25:55.597
My kid.
Well, once our lab

25:55.639 --> 25:59.142
confirms DNA, he can go home
with his mother.

25:59.184 --> 26:01.144
Who the hell
do you think I am?

26:03.146 --> 26:05.148
Mrs. Esposito...

26:07.150 --> 26:08.652
...did you adopt Adam?

26:09.152 --> 26:10.612
Give me a break.

26:10.654 --> 26:13.157
26 hours in labor.
Finally had a C-section.

26:23.667 --> 26:25.169
Did you have twins?

26:31.675 --> 26:35.179
Can I take Jesse home now?

26:35.220 --> 26:36.638
I need your help

26:36.680 --> 26:38.682
to tie up a
few loose ends.

26:38.724 --> 26:41.143
Of course, anything.

26:41.185 --> 26:42.936
Let's start with a
sample of your DNA.

26:42.978 --> 26:44.688
What? We have to follow procedure

26:44.730 --> 26:46.648
for everyone's protection.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.692
In fact, Jesse can't
even be released

26:48.734 --> 26:50.652
without a positive match.

26:50.694 --> 26:53.197
He-he-he-he doesn't
stay up this late.

26:53.238 --> 26:54.698
I'll make it a
rush, I promise.

26:59.203 --> 27:01.205
Open your
mouth, please.

27:04.208 --> 27:07.169
It's the same kid.

27:07.211 --> 27:09.213
It's a doppelganger
with an identical scar.

27:09.254 --> 27:11.173
Well, he picked
Mrs. Esposito.

27:11.215 --> 27:12.716
I mean, I know
there's cases in which

27:12.758 --> 27:14.218
the kidnappers
threaten their victims-

27:14.259 --> 27:15.761
"Tell them
that I'm your mother,

27:15.802 --> 27:17.221
or I'll kill
your real mom. "

27:17.262 --> 27:18.680
I don't think he's lying.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.225
I don't think that
Mrs. Esposito's lying, either.

27:21.266 --> 27:23.185
Karen Matthews had

27:23.227 --> 27:25.187
a house full
of photos of him.

27:25.229 --> 27:27.231
Well, I'm sure
the Espositos do, too.

27:30.234 --> 27:33.487
There's something off
about this picture.

27:33.529 --> 27:36.740
Yeah, it seems kind of set up,
doesn't it?

27:41.245 --> 27:42.746
The pixel density's
not the same.

27:47.251 --> 27:49.753
Where'd she get
this picture of Adam?

27:49.795 --> 27:50.712
How'd she get it?

27:50.754 --> 27:52.214
Maybe she's a stalker.

27:52.256 --> 27:53.757
No, she wouldn't have
stalked us to Cape May.

27:53.799 --> 27:54.716
This isn't it.

27:54.758 --> 27:56.718
It's the only shore
we've been to.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.720
Do you recognize anything
in the picture?

27:58.762 --> 28:00.764
Yeah, that's the shirt his
Nana gave him last summer.

28:00.806 --> 28:02.266
He only wore
that that once,

28:02.307 --> 28:04.560
at our family reunion.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.770
Was Karen Matthews there?

28:06.812 --> 28:09.231
No way.

28:09.273 --> 28:11.024
Mr. Esposito...

28:11.066 --> 28:12.734
several witnesses

28:12.776 --> 28:15.279
saw a man matching
your description

28:15.320 --> 28:17.322
at Mesa Valley Park

28:17.322 --> 28:19.241
when Jesse disappeared.

28:19.283 --> 28:20.784
Yeah, I'm there
all the time.

28:20.826 --> 28:22.244
We live around
the corner.

28:22.286 --> 28:24.288
We just had Adam's birthday
party there last month.

28:24.329 --> 28:25.247
Yeah.

28:25.289 --> 28:27.791
Were you there
the day before yesterday?

28:27.833 --> 28:29.751
Yeah, with Adam. Yeah.

28:29.793 --> 28:32.296
You told me you were
taking him for ice cream.

28:32.337 --> 28:33.797
What were you doing
in the park?

28:33.839 --> 28:35.841
I had to meet a guy.

28:35.841 --> 28:37.801
A guy? Oh, my God.

28:38.802 --> 28:39.803
You're putting money
down on a game?

28:40.304 --> 28:41.305
You promised you quit.
I did,

28:41.346 --> 28:42.264
all right?

28:42.306 --> 28:43.307
It's for a guy at work.

28:47.311 --> 28:49.313
Three-to-one, right?

28:51.815 --> 28:53.317
Adam!

28:55.819 --> 28:57.821
Well, you should have
just took him for ice cream.

29:00.324 --> 29:02.326
So, Karen took a picture
of herself at the beach

29:02.367 --> 29:04.828
and Photoshopped Jesse in.

29:04.870 --> 29:05.787
Right.

29:05.829 --> 29:07.789
So if that's really

29:07.831 --> 29:10.834
Adam Esposito, where did
she get the pictures from?

29:10.876 --> 29:12.336
Well, let us see.

29:13.837 --> 29:15.339
Where are you going?

29:15.380 --> 29:18.634
Image search.

29:18.634 --> 29:21.803
Family home page.

29:21.845 --> 29:24.348
My mom wants me to do one
of these for our family.

29:24.389 --> 29:25.307
Click on

29:25.349 --> 29:28.852
where it says "Adam's
Birthday Party. "

29:28.894 --> 29:30.812
That one.
Yeah.

29:30.854 --> 29:33.357
Maybe Karen
found the site,

29:33.857 --> 29:35.317
cut out the
kid's picture.

29:35.359 --> 29:38.320
That's Mesa Valley Park.

29:38.362 --> 29:40.864
Karen Matthews faked
those photos

29:40.906 --> 29:42.366
that she gave
Catherine.

29:42.407 --> 29:43.826
How?

29:43.867 --> 29:45.869
Cut-and-paste...

29:46.370 --> 29:47.871
from photos that she
got off the Internet.

29:47.913 --> 29:49.331
The Espositos told Catherine

29:49.373 --> 29:51.875
that they were at the park
with their son

29:51.917 --> 29:53.377
the day Jesse Matthews
disappeared.

29:53.418 --> 29:54.378
Is that
a coincidence?

29:54.878 --> 29:57.381
No. My guess is Karen's been
downloading pictures

29:57.422 --> 29:59.383
from the family Web
site for a while,

29:59.883 --> 30:01.885
the most recent
being from Mesa Valley Park.

30:01.927 --> 30:03.679
Could Karen
have recognized the park

30:03.679 --> 30:05.347
from the pictures
on the Web site?

30:05.389 --> 30:08.392
Yeah, and she went there
hoping to see him again.

30:08.433 --> 30:09.893
But she reported him missing.

30:09.935 --> 30:11.436
That makes no sense.

30:11.436 --> 30:13.188
I got the DNA results.

30:13.230 --> 30:14.898
The boy is Adam Esposito.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.191
Victor and Valerie

30:16.233 --> 30:17.359
are his parents.

30:17.401 --> 30:18.402
There you go. She's lying.

30:18.443 --> 30:19.444
She doesn't have a son.

30:19.444 --> 30:20.362
Uh, not quite.

30:20.404 --> 30:24.408
She's got 13 alleles
in common with the male DNA

30:24.449 --> 30:25.909
that we got from the
toothbrush exemplar.

30:25.951 --> 30:27.870
So she does have a son.

30:27.911 --> 30:28.871
I was inside
the house.

30:28.912 --> 30:31.874
Believe me, a kid
does live there.

30:31.915 --> 30:36.420
And we're still looking
for Jesse Matthews.

30:47.931 --> 30:49.433
Karen Matthews.

30:52.936 --> 30:54.938
Can I take Jesse home now?

30:54.980 --> 30:56.899
I'm afraid not, no.

30:56.940 --> 30:59.443
The DNA confirms the
boy's not your child.

30:59.484 --> 31:01.403
I...

31:01.445 --> 31:04.198
That-that's impossible.
And your actions

31:04.239 --> 31:06.950
regarding the Espositos
constitutes stalking

31:06.992 --> 31:08.911
and possible kidnapping.

31:08.952 --> 31:10.454
Please go with
this officer.

31:10.496 --> 31:11.413
No, no...

31:11.455 --> 31:12.956
Wh-What have you done
with Jesse?

31:12.998 --> 31:14.416
Ma'am...

31:14.458 --> 31:15.709
Where is he?
Ma'am...

31:15.751 --> 31:16.919
Jesse?
Please, ma'am...

31:16.960 --> 31:18.462
Jesse? Jesse, where are you?!

31:18.504 --> 31:19.421
Ma'am, please...

31:19.463 --> 31:20.964
I need to see my son!

31:21.006 --> 31:21.924
Jesse!

31:21.965 --> 31:23.967
Jesse, where are you?!

31:24.009 --> 31:25.969
Please! Please! Jesse!

31:26.011 --> 31:28.430
Jesse!

31:28.472 --> 31:30.224
Jesse, where are you?!

31:30.265 --> 31:31.934
"Jesse David Matthews.

31:31.975 --> 31:33.477
"Mother Karen, father Dwight.

31:33.519 --> 31:35.479
"Born August 31,

31:35.521 --> 31:36.438
1999."

31:36.480 --> 31:37.940
I also checked

31:37.981 --> 31:39.483
for a death certificate.

31:39.525 --> 31:40.442
Nothing on file.

31:40.484 --> 31:42.945
These are all
in chronological order.

31:42.986 --> 31:45.489
Archie confirmed
that all the photos taken

31:45.531 --> 31:46.990
along the top
row were genuine,

31:47.032 --> 31:48.450
up until the
photo taken

31:48.492 --> 31:51.495
at the funeral,
in which he was two.

31:51.537 --> 31:52.996
So the rest of these were faked

31:53.038 --> 31:54.498
using Adam Esposito?

31:54.540 --> 31:55.457
Yeah.

31:55.499 --> 31:57.000
You talked to
the neighbors.

31:57.042 --> 31:58.961
What did they say?

31:59.002 --> 32:00.504
Jesse and Karen kept
to themselves,

32:00.546 --> 32:01.964
but he was always leaving

32:02.005 --> 32:04.007
his toys around outside.
They saw his toys-

32:04.049 --> 32:05.467
did they see him?

32:05.509 --> 32:08.512
Well, when I asked, "When was
the last time you saw Jesse?"

32:08.554 --> 32:10.305
no one remembered
exactly.

32:10.305 --> 32:11.974
What about his grandparents?

32:12.015 --> 32:14.017
They haven't seen him
since the funeral.

32:14.059 --> 32:17.062
Has anyone seen Jesse
since he was two?

32:17.062 --> 32:20.023
His teachers or a doctor,
baby-sitters...?

32:20.065 --> 32:21.483
Well, he was home-schooled,

32:21.525 --> 32:24.528
and we're looking into a doctor
and a sitter.

32:25.529 --> 32:27.781
Well, I guess
we can impound her car

32:27.823 --> 32:30.033
and find out
if there's any evidence

32:30.075 --> 32:32.578
that he was
even in there.

32:32.578 --> 32:34.997
For four years,
she's created

32:35.038 --> 32:38.041
an elaborate fantasy...
which collided with reality

32:38.083 --> 32:40.544
at Mesa Valley Park.

32:46.550 --> 32:48.051
Jesse.

32:52.055 --> 32:53.015
Jesse?

32:53.056 --> 32:55.517
Where are you?! Jesse?!

32:55.559 --> 32:58.061
I suppose she thought
it was her son that was gone

32:58.103 --> 32:59.605
when she looked back
at that empty swing.

32:59.605 --> 33:01.064
When she couldn't
find him,

33:01.106 --> 33:03.025
she called the police.

33:03.066 --> 33:06.570
Jesse's been missing
for four years.

33:06.612 --> 33:08.864
We're chasing a ghost.

33:08.864 --> 33:11.033
We went to the park.

33:11.074 --> 33:14.036
I- I brought
Jesse's new jacket.

33:14.077 --> 33:18.081
He was on the swings,
and when I wasn't looking,

33:18.123 --> 33:21.043
a man in a blue cap
took him.

33:21.084 --> 33:23.086
Karen, tell me what
happened four years ago,

33:23.128 --> 33:24.588
after your husband
was killed.

33:27.591 --> 33:30.052
I- I... That's a...

33:30.093 --> 33:32.054
I am not the one
that should be here.

33:32.095 --> 33:35.098
You should be talking
to the man that took Jesse.

33:35.140 --> 33:36.892
Did Jesse get sick?

33:36.892 --> 33:38.602
Was there an accident?

33:41.104 --> 33:43.065
Karen?

33:43.106 --> 33:47.110
Did something
happen to Jesse?

33:49.112 --> 33:52.366
Is Jesse dead?

33:52.407 --> 33:55.577
You saw him.

33:55.619 --> 34:00.123
You were... you were there
while I held him in my arms.

34:00.165 --> 34:02.125
Why are you putting me
through this?

34:03.627 --> 34:05.629
Tell me. Why?

34:08.632 --> 34:11.134
So, how do we do this?

34:11.176 --> 34:13.178
Old school.

34:13.178 --> 34:15.097
Soil probes.

34:15.138 --> 34:19.141
The probe goes deeper
where the soil's been disturbed.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.605
And that's where we dig?

34:23.647 --> 34:26.149
On the one hand, you really want
to find the body.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.650
Give it respect,

34:28.150 --> 34:30.154
provide closure...

34:30.654 --> 34:32.156
On the other hand...

34:32.197 --> 34:34.658
Yeah.

34:42.666 --> 34:44.168
She would have buried
the body

34:44.668 --> 34:47.670
where he would have
still been close to her.

34:47.713 --> 34:50.674
You know, I'm not finding
any density changes.

34:50.716 --> 34:52.676
Me neither.

35:00.684 --> 35:03.937
Somebody replaced
this fence board right here.

35:03.979 --> 35:07.191
These other ones look
like they've been chewed on.

35:08.192 --> 35:10.194
The guy said
that Karen freaked out

35:10.235 --> 35:12.154
when his dog barked
at her kid.

35:12.196 --> 35:16.200
Maybe the dog chewed
through the fence.

35:17.201 --> 35:19.703
There's definitely a change
in density there.

35:19.745 --> 35:20.704
Let's start digging.

35:40.224 --> 35:41.183
I found this

35:41.225 --> 35:42.726
in Karen's
medicine chest.

35:42.768 --> 35:44.186
Olanzapine.

35:44.228 --> 35:46.230
That's a heavy-duty
antipsychotic.

35:46.730 --> 35:47.689
Yeah,

35:47.731 --> 35:49.983
but the prescription's
over four years old.

35:50.025 --> 35:52.903
I'll have Brass subpoena
her medical records.

35:52.903 --> 35:55.739
You know, if she was being
treated for psychosis,

35:55.781 --> 35:57.699
it could explain
all of this,

35:57.741 --> 35:58.742
because she didn't
overlook a single detail.

35:58.784 --> 36:00.285
I think she even did

36:00.285 --> 36:01.703
the finger paintings.

36:01.745 --> 36:03.247
It's hard for anyone to let go
of someone they love.

36:03.288 --> 36:05.707
Yeah.

36:05.749 --> 36:06.750
After my dad died,

36:07.251 --> 36:09.753
my mom would still get him
a present every Christmas.

36:09.795 --> 36:11.713
She'd put it
under the tree.

36:11.755 --> 36:14.258
Christmas morning,
the wrapping paper would be

36:14.299 --> 36:16.718
all crumpled
up and, uh...

36:16.760 --> 36:18.762
the tie or the sweater,
whatever it was,

36:18.804 --> 36:20.806
would be hanging
in their closet.

36:20.806 --> 36:22.766
How old were you when he died?

36:23.767 --> 36:26.228
Nine.

36:26.270 --> 36:29.273
Little guy.

36:29.773 --> 36:33.777
I'll get started
in Karen's room.

36:33.819 --> 36:35.779
He taught botany.

36:35.821 --> 36:38.240
He, uh...

36:38.282 --> 36:41.285
came home from school
one hot, humid day,

36:41.326 --> 36:43.287
laid down on the couch.

36:43.787 --> 36:44.788
I was watching TV.

36:46.790 --> 36:49.793
My mom brought in
some cold drinks...

36:49.835 --> 36:53.297
but she couldn't wake him up.

36:56.300 --> 36:58.802
No one would tell me why.

37:37.841 --> 37:40.844
CSI Stokes, you have
a visitor in Reception.

37:41.345 --> 37:43.347
CSI Stokes, you have
a visitor in Reception.

37:44.348 --> 37:45.849
Hey, Hodges.

37:45.891 --> 37:47.309
Oh, hey, Nick.

37:47.351 --> 37:48.810
Did you hear you
had a visitor?

37:48.852 --> 37:51.355
Yeah, and you have a tissue
sample with adherent hairs.

37:51.396 --> 37:53.857
Examine the hairs and get
the tissue sample to DNA.

37:53.899 --> 37:54.816
Priority.

37:54.858 --> 37:56.360
I'll just drop
everything I'm doing.

37:56.401 --> 37:57.319
Priority:
Nick Stokes.

37:57.361 --> 37:58.862
You're coming around, Hodges.

38:02.866 --> 38:04.868
Hey. I, uh... I
have a visitor?

38:11.375 --> 38:13.126
Kelly?

38:13.168 --> 38:14.837
Hi.
Hi.

38:14.878 --> 38:17.631
You... you got out.

38:17.673 --> 38:20.384
Couple days ago.

38:20.425 --> 38:22.344
Mm...

38:22.386 --> 38:26.890
Parole hearing board
liked my smile.

38:32.396 --> 38:36.400
You know, I thought I saw you
at a crime scene the other day.

38:36.441 --> 38:37.401
You did.

38:37.901 --> 38:38.861
I did?

38:38.902 --> 38:41.405
Just checking it out.

38:43.407 --> 38:46.410
You know how...
when you came to see me,

38:46.451 --> 38:49.371
uh, what you said...

38:49.413 --> 38:51.915
about when I get out,
not taking it with me?

38:53.417 --> 38:55.919
I've been thinking
a lot about that.

38:57.421 --> 39:00.424
I wanted you to know.

39:01.925 --> 39:03.427
You all right?

39:03.468 --> 39:05.429
Perfect.

39:39.963 --> 39:42.966
That would be Queenie.

39:44.968 --> 39:45.928
Even after
four years,

39:45.969 --> 39:48.472
you'd expect to find some bones.

39:48.514 --> 39:49.973
There's nothing.

39:57.981 --> 40:00.484
Jesse liked dinosaurs.

40:13.497 --> 40:15.499
Let's see what Hodges
can tell us.

40:18.502 --> 40:21.964
The GCMS soil analysis
found Cadaverine,

40:22.005 --> 40:25.509
Putrescine and several other
organic compounds.

40:25.551 --> 40:28.470
Yeah. English, please?

40:28.512 --> 40:32.015
It means there was a body
buried in Karen's backyard.

40:32.057 --> 40:33.475
Just too long ago
to get any DNA.

40:33.517 --> 40:36.478
But Hodges also found traces
of Olanzapine.

40:36.520 --> 40:39.523
Well, that's interesting,
because a warrant came through

40:39.565 --> 40:41.024
on Karen Matthews'
medical records,

40:41.066 --> 40:41.984
and after her son was born,

40:42.025 --> 40:45.529
Karen was treated for
postpartum psychosis,

40:45.571 --> 40:49.032
which her doctors treated
by prescribing

40:49.074 --> 40:50.534
Olanzapine.

40:51.034 --> 40:51.535
Even a small amount
of that stuff

40:52.035 --> 40:53.787
would be lethal
to a two-year-old.

40:53.829 --> 40:55.539
Karen is already
mentally fragile

40:55.581 --> 40:57.499
when her husband is killed.

40:57.541 --> 41:01.044
She gets into a very heated
argument with the in-laws

41:01.086 --> 41:04.006
at his funeral, goes
over the deep end,

41:04.047 --> 41:08.051
poisons Jesse and buries him
in the backyard near the fence.

41:09.052 --> 41:11.513
But then she digs him up. Why?

41:11.555 --> 41:15.058
We have evidence to suggest
that the neighbor's dog

41:15.100 --> 41:17.102
was digging in Karen's backyard.

41:17.102 --> 41:19.062
The neighbor
claims that Karen

41:19.104 --> 41:20.522
killed his dog.

41:20.564 --> 41:23.567
If the dog detected decomp

41:23.609 --> 41:26.528
and dug near
the grave,

41:26.570 --> 41:28.572
Karen may have moved the body
to protect him.

41:28.614 --> 41:30.574
So where's Jesse's body?

41:31.074 --> 41:33.035
Nick found a patch

41:33.076 --> 41:35.579
of tissue and hair
in the trunk of Karen's car.

41:35.621 --> 41:37.039
The DNA matches the toothbrush.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.583
If Karen doesn't
tell us where to look,

41:39.625 --> 41:41.376
I doubt we'll ever find
the body.

41:41.376 --> 41:43.086
You know, as long
as I do this job,

41:43.128 --> 41:44.046
I can never understand

41:44.087 --> 41:46.048
how a mother can kill
her child.

41:46.089 --> 41:49.593
Euripedes tried to understand
it when he wroteMedea.

41:49.635 --> 41:53.096
"I will slay my children
without delaying long enough

41:53.138 --> 41:55.599
to hand them over
to some more savage hand. "

41:57.601 --> 42:01.104
Medea, like Karen,
was a soldier's wife.

42:01.146 --> 42:03.065
His father was a soldier.

42:03.106 --> 42:05.067
His grandfather was a soldier.

42:05.108 --> 42:09.112
Karen did not want that
for Jesse.

42:09.154 --> 42:10.614
Well, it's still murder.

42:23.627 --> 42:26.630
Mommy...

42:29.132 --> 42:31.635
Mommy!

42:32.305 --> 42:38.613
