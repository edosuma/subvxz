    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.173 --> 00:08.140
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.209 --> 00:10.442
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:10.510 --> 00:13.111
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:13.180 --> 00:15.413

    sailing man ¶

00:15.482 --> 00:17.682

00:17.751 --> 00:20.185

      set sail that day ¶

00:20.253 --> 00:22.354

00:22.423 --> 00:25.290
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:25.359 --> 00:27.292

00:27.361 --> 00:29.528

     getting rough ¶

00:29.597 --> 00:31.630
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.698 --> 00:34.232

    of the fearless crew ¶

01:18.678 --> 01:20.178
[exhaling]

01:20.247 --> 01:22.448
- Mornin', Mary Ann.
    - Good morning, Skipper.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.016
- How are you this morning?
  - Just fine.

01:25.085 --> 01:25.917
Know what I'd love for
          breakfast?

01:25.986 --> 01:27.118
What?

01:27.187 --> 01:28.420
Some nice,
          sauced scrambled eggs.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.555
And a nice thick slice
          of tinned ham.

01:30.624 --> 01:31.723
Oh, so would I.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.359
But all we gonna get
is mackerel and sliced banana.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.761
Mackerel
              and sliced banana!

01:35.829 --> 01:38.029
- That sounds awful!
      - Probably will be.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.832
Come on,
             breakfast is ready.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.567
Here you go.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.803
Oh, that Gilligan
      never does anything right.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.104
What did he do now?

01:46.173 --> 01:47.972
Look at the way
           he washed this plate.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.408
Looks clean to me.

01:49.476 --> 01:52.010
Well, what's that spot here,
    in the middle of it?

01:52.079 --> 01:53.645
That's your breakfast.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.585
You call that a banana?

01:59.653 --> 02:03.121
No. I think
that's the mackerel.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.156
All the food is
shriveling up like that.

02:05.225 --> 02:06.958
The Professor says
it's some kinda blight.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.561
This could be serious.
       Has he gotta cure for it?

02:09.630 --> 02:12.597
I dunno. He's in the vegetable
garden making some tests.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.132
Well, I better
                  talk to him.

02:14.201 --> 02:16.168
You want me to keep
the breakfast warm?

02:16.236 --> 02:18.170
No, Mary Ann. Keep it
           from blowing away.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.641
These are the last of the seeds
 from my healthy plants.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.310
If we can keep the birds away
   from them, we maybe alright.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.112
What can we do
about the birds?

02:27.181 --> 02:28.780
Gilligan said
            he'd keep them away.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.850
Gilligan said he'd keep 'em away
why doesn't he keep 'em away?

02:31.919 --> 02:33.252
'I am, Skipper.'

02:35.523 --> 02:37.622
Don't you know a
scarecrow when you see one?

02:37.691 --> 02:38.723
[cawing]

02:38.792 --> 02:43.862
Hey...It works. It worked,
Skipper, it worked.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.740
Not too much soup,
       now Gilligan.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.675
Don't worry Skipper. Only
two spoonful's to a customer.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.278
- Thanks, Gilligan.
      - Yeah.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.216
Is this
            all I get, Gilligan?

03:05.285 --> 03:07.519
Sorry, Ginger,
but we're on strict rations.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.723
Strict is right.
  I didn't even get my lips wet.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.827
Thurston Howell III
             in the soup line.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.862
Been drummed out
         of the social register.

03:17.931 --> 03:21.532
I'm sorry, but the blight has
destroyed our whole food supply.

03:21.601 --> 03:22.801
The Professor went to the
   other side of the island

03:22.870 --> 03:25.537
to look for some crops.
    He's our only hope.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.439
Mrs. Howell.

03:28.508 --> 03:30.442
You mean this
      is the entire meal.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.544
How about some napkins,
    we have plenty of those.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.781
Folks. Let's stop complaining
 and face up to the facts.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.551
We'll have to stay on these
  rations for a while.

03:39.620 --> 03:43.454
One string bean, one olive and
 one cup of soup per person.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.657
Skipper, can I have
      another olive?

03:45.726 --> 03:48.326
I'm sorry, Mr. Howell,
     one olive per person.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.162
Mr. Howell,
          you can have my olive.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.829
I already took yours.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.567
Folks, we've got to cooperate
 if we wanna avoid starvation.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.937
Ginger, I'd give you $500
   for your olive.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.072
Oh, Thurston,
                that's not fair.

04:01.141 --> 04:03.408
You're right, dear.
Make it a 1,000.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.211
Well, imagine,
a $1,000 for an olive.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.646
Without a martini.

04:07.714 --> 04:10.415
Anybody want any more
string beans, we got three left.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.317
Thurston,
             have some of those.

04:12.386 --> 04:15.186
No, Lovey. If I can't
have another olive

04:15.255 --> 04:17.422
I'm not gonna eat
my string beans.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.624
Please, I'm giving you
     all a warning.

04:19.692 --> 04:22.493
We've got to stay on these
rations if we expect to survive.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.263
Skipper, is it that bad?
        Is it really that bad?

04:25.331 --> 04:27.499
Gilligan, I..
         Professor!

04:29.703 --> 04:31.069
Professor, what about
     those crops?

04:31.137 --> 04:33.805
- Did you find out anything?
  - I certainly did.

04:33.873 --> 04:36.073
Hey, looks like the blight
   didn't hurt these raisins.

04:36.142 --> 04:39.544
Gilligan, those raisins
       happen to be watermelons.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.586
[rustling]

04:48.254 --> 04:49.488
Gilligan.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.028
Hey! Hey!
     How about this stuff?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.864
Looks good enough to eat
and there's plenty of it.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.799
Well, the professor
      says it's poisonous.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.834
- You sure, Professor?
   - Well, I'm not positive.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.870
Most of this species
            is highly toxic.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.571
Couldn't one of us
     taste it to find out?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.473
No, it's dangerous
              to take a chance.

05:08.541 --> 05:12.444
- Even with me?
 - Even with you, little buddy.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.179
[duck quacking]

05:14.248 --> 05:15.480
What's that?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.985
It's a wild duck, it's headed
   straight for the lagoon.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.686
Let's go.

05:21.755 --> 05:22.754
Darn it!

05:24.324 --> 05:26.325
[quacking continues]

05:28.428 --> 05:30.362
Look at him.
         What a beauty!

05:30.431 --> 05:31.930
What a meal!
        Let's kill him.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.866
Wait a minute, Skipper.
   Nobody's gonna eat that bird.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.001
(Skipper)
  'What're you talking about?'

05:37.070 --> 05:39.670
(Professor)
 'He happens to be a migratory
 duck from North America.'

05:39.739 --> 05:42.007
And it's just possible,
         he might rescue us.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.875
It'll never work. He couldn't
 even carry one of us.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.379
Gilligan! I see
what you mean, Professor.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.246
We'll tie a message
to his leg, right?

05:49.315 --> 05:50.949
Exactly.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.818
Somebody will see the message
when he gets back to the States.

05:53.886 --> 05:56.588
That duck's the best chance
     to get off this island.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.623
- Let's capture him.
      - Wait a minute.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.626
Best place is over here
     by the reeds. Take it easy.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.829
- Can't frighten him. No noise.
- Shh!

06:05.566 --> 06:07.032
[duck quacking]

06:16.576 --> 06:18.043
Gilligan.
         Get over here.

06:27.253 --> 06:28.587
[quacking continues]

06:35.062 --> 06:36.695
Sorry!

06:36.763 --> 06:40.065
Quack! Quack! Quack!
      Quack! Quack! Quack!

06:42.836 --> 06:46.437
Poor devil. The sun has finally
got him. He thinks he's a duck.

06:46.506 --> 06:47.872
- Thurston, what can we do?
  - Nothing.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.642
He's safe as long as
he doesn't try to fly.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.810
Quack! Quack! Quack!
      Quack! Quack! Quack!

06:52.879 --> 06:54.045
(Skipper)
        'Quack! Quack!'

06:54.114 --> 06:55.547
Quack! Quack!

06:55.615 --> 06:57.915
(Skipper)
     'Quack! Quack! Quack!
     Quack! Quack! Quack!'

06:57.984 --> 06:59.750
Quack! Quack!
         Quack! Quack!

06:59.819 --> 07:00.985
(Skipper)
           'Quack!'

07:01.054 --> 07:03.120
- Quack! Quack!
       - 'Quack! Quack!'

07:03.189 --> 07:04.289
Quack! Quack! Quack!

07:04.357 --> 07:06.924
- Quack!
     - Quack! Quack! Quack!

07:06.993 --> 07:09.795
- Quack! Quack! Quack!
     - Quack! Quack! Quack!

07:11.264 --> 07:12.764
Gilligan!

07:15.101 --> 07:16.067
Skipper, I'm--

07:16.136 --> 07:18.637
[duck quacking]

07:18.705 --> 07:20.172
He's in the lagoon.

07:30.384 --> 07:32.350
I made that decoy
of an old shoe.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.018
With feathers on 'em.
How does it look?

07:34.087 --> 07:36.053
Like an old shoe
           with feathers on 'em.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.522
Very good looking.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.759
I hope that duck
                is near sighted.

07:41.828 --> 07:45.096
Excellent.
It's getting closer.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.133
[duck quacking]

07:48.201 --> 07:49.801
Look, it's working.

07:49.869 --> 07:52.137
Your lucky. I think
       the duck is near sighted.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.638
It'd go for anything.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.742
When he gets close, Skipper.
Grab him.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.181
Take it easy now.
            Don't pull too hard.

08:07.554 --> 08:10.021
I forgot.
I had a hole in my shoe.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.323
Forgot you had a hole
           in your head. Quick.

08:12.391 --> 08:15.760
- Get him before he flies away.
- I'll wade in and get him.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.795
We'll, try. But don't splash
    around cause you'll

08:17.864 --> 08:19.397
scare him off for sure.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.799
Okay.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.936
[duck quacking]

08:34.313 --> 08:36.748
Gilligan, bring him in here.
  Bring him in here.

08:39.785 --> 08:42.554
I will. As soon as
      he stops kissing me.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.494
You can't tell me that
     little buzzard is gonna fly

08:49.563 --> 08:51.529
all the way back
           to the United States.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.030
I refuse to believe it.

08:53.099 --> 08:55.132
Wild ducks are known
to fly thousands of miles.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.068
How long will it
           take him to get back?

08:57.136 --> 09:01.039
Well, it's hard to say.
Two days, a week, maybe more.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.741
- It's an unscheduled duck.
 - What are you gonna name him?

09:03.810 --> 09:05.577
I'm gonna name him
after my grandfather.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.045
- What was his name?
      - Everett.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.080
That's right, Gilligan.
     Give him all he wants.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.050
- Gotta build up his strength.
 - But, whose gonna build ours?

09:12.119 --> 09:15.386
I've heard a salt free diets,
   but this is a food free one.

09:15.455 --> 09:16.988
- I've lost five pounds.
    - So have I.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.557
But, I'm an actress.
       If I lose any more weight

09:19.626 --> 09:22.560
when I get back to Hollywood,
   I'd be playing boy's parts.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.562
If you're an actress,
     act that.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.864
I still say we gotta eat
the little beast.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.734
You eat that duck and you eat
our chance to be rescued.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.236
Besides, he's so cute,
          how could you eat him?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.372
Roasted, my dear, roasted.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.774
[duck quacking]

09:38.045 --> 09:39.577
Well, I think
     Everett's had enough.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.212
I'm gonna take him
       for a little walk.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.782
Alright, Gilligan.
  But don't let him get away.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.956
Gilligan,
       where's the duck?

09:52.325 --> 09:54.125
[duck quacking]

09:57.764 --> 10:00.131
Say, he looks
      nice and strong now.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.733
He sure is. He even
  pulled me off my feet once.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.636
- Wonderful Gilligan.
    - I got a message ready.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.205
- Bring him down.
       - Ah, okay.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.373
[duck quacking]

10:10.543 --> 10:12.010
Well, Gilligan,
        bring him down.

10:12.078 --> 10:15.546
It's like you said, Skipper.
He sure is a lot stronger.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.115
Careful, Gilligan.
       Don't hurt him.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.683
Hurt him. Ha ha!

10:21.488 --> 10:22.721
[spring snapping]

10:24.957 --> 10:26.991
Nice going, Gilligan.
     Now what do we do?

10:27.060 --> 10:29.694
Don't worry, Skipper.
I know how to get him down.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.301
Hey, Everett!
       Clear for landing!

10:40.073 --> 10:41.072
[mumbling]

10:42.275 --> 10:44.075
[duck quacking]

10:44.144 --> 10:45.877
What did you
wave him off for?

10:45.946 --> 10:48.680
Didn't you see, he had not
   to put his feet down.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.349
Gilligan! Well,
get him back in here.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.417
- Aye, aye sir!
        - Oh!

10:53.486 --> 10:54.919
Everett!

10:56.356 --> 10:57.655
Come on, Everett!

10:57.724 --> 11:00.492
Hold him still, Gilligan,
  while I attach this message.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.293
Okay. I'm sure
    gonna miss you, Everett.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.063
Yes, everytime we sit down at
 the table, we'll miss you.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.833
- All set.
           - Oh, boy.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.801
Okay, Everett, now.
     And please be careful.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.104
And remember. Glide a lot,
    it's a long way.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.406
Fly below the clouds,
don't go near the mountains

11:15.474 --> 11:19.009
and for goodness sake's,
stay away from the airplanes.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.446
And remember, if you meet
       a cute little lady duck

11:21.514 --> 11:24.816
along the way,
       business before pleasure.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.418
Alright, Gilligan,
it's time.

11:27.487 --> 11:31.956
Alright, Everett, good luck,
 take off, and don't look back.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.759
It's the only
                   way to fly.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.894
[duck quacking]

11:36.963 --> 11:38.796
- Go, go, go.
         - Fly!

11:38.864 --> 11:40.431
Carry the message,
       do it well.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.367
[duck quacking]

11:46.872 --> 11:48.673
I think he's landing.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.108
[duck quacking]

11:51.177 --> 11:53.277
Professor,
     why did he come back?

11:53.346 --> 11:54.378
I don't know.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.415
[duck quacking]
     It's his dinner time.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.822
[duck quacking]

12:04.891 --> 12:08.526
Here's a good place, Everett.
 Yeah, here.

12:08.595 --> 12:11.930
We better stay here. I don't
  like how they look at you.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.198
We're not careful,
  you're gonna be a dead duck.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.199
[duck quacking]

12:15.268 --> 12:17.402
Oops, sorry, I shouldn't
    have said that.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.038
But, if you don't learn to fly
 and take that message

12:20.106 --> 12:23.674
your goose is gonna be cooked.
 [duck quacking]

12:23.743 --> 12:24.775
Did it again.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.410
[quacking continues]

12:26.479 --> 12:28.446
I'm sorry. Sorry.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.550
[duck quacking]

12:32.619 --> 12:35.820
Well, I'll be..

12:35.889 --> 12:38.857
You're not an Everett,
     you're an Emily.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.725
No wonder you couldn't fly.
  You're top heavy.

12:41.794 --> 12:44.896
Oh, you're bottom heavy.

12:44.964 --> 12:48.065
I bet you can fly now.
Come on, we'll tell the others.

12:48.134 --> 12:50.068
Some of them didn't
     even finish the stew.

12:50.136 --> 12:54.872
It's pretty hard to stare at
a nice plump duck and eat this.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.208
That duck might be able
    to save our necks.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.144
I say, he's fit for frying,
  not for flying.

13:00.212 --> 13:01.712
(Gilligan)
      'Skipper, Skipper.'

13:01.781 --> 13:05.449
Skipper, Skipper, he's a she,
he's a she, and he can fly now.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.151
I mean,
        she can fly now.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.720
Calm down.
    What are you telling us?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.322
I'm telling you,
    Everett's name is Emily.

13:11.391 --> 13:15.360
And no wonder she couldn't fly
in the condition she was in, eh?

13:15.428 --> 13:19.063
Skipper, she can fly. She really
can, Skipper, she can.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.666
Oh, Gilligan, maybe he
     had something there.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.502
Let's find out. I'll put
  the message back on his leg.

13:24.570 --> 13:27.472
- Yeah, her leg.
- Oh, sorry, Gilligan, her leg.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.740
Now, maybe we can see
     if he'll fly.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.575
- She, Skipper.
        - Okay, she!

13:31.644 --> 13:32.910
- All set.
           - Yeah.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.213
Come on, Emily.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.648
- Watch him go.
        - Her, Gilligan.

13:37.716 --> 13:39.850
Oh, yeah, okay, Emily.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.620
Fly!

13:42.689 --> 13:44.289
[duck quacking]

13:46.559 --> 13:48.126
Fly!

13:48.194 --> 13:49.527
It's no use,
Gilligan.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.829
That duck's not going
anywhere but in a pot.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.798
Oh-ho.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.666
Come on, Emily.
    Our lives depend on it.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.001
Fly!

14:07.814 --> 14:12.150
Fly, fly, fly, fly!

14:13.620 --> 14:15.119
[duck quacking]

14:46.719 --> 14:52.055
No, I'm not gonna let you,
   let you do it, no.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.524
You can't have her.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.600
Emily, you'll get a fair trial
'cause I'm here to protect you.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.002
They don't call me
 Marshal Gilligan for nothing.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.938
[duck quacking]

15:10.943 --> 15:12.476
Let's go.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.712
The minute I see that Gilligan,
I'm gonna fill him full of gold.

15:15.781 --> 15:17.181
Don't you mean Lead?

15:17.250 --> 15:21.486
Oh, Howell use lead? He-ha,
  Such a vulgar metal.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.291
[duck quacking]

15:30.296 --> 15:32.763
Yeah, that will never
     get him a lead.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.565
(Gilligan)
           'Skipper!'

15:34.634 --> 15:36.033
Yes, sir, Mr. Gilligan.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.402
I just cleaned up the floor
and I don't know

15:38.470 --> 15:39.870
what somebody dragged
in there, but--

15:39.939 --> 15:41.271
Skipper!

15:41.340 --> 15:43.740
I'm goin' out there
         to stop that lynch mob.

15:43.809 --> 15:47.378
- You stay here and guard Emily.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Gilligan.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.881
Just a minute.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.918
So, can't even
            trust my own deputy.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.920
You're plannin' on eatin' that
  duck yourself, weren't you?

15:56.989 --> 15:59.756
Well, speak up! You must have
  something to say for yourself.

15:59.825 --> 16:01.859
Mr. Gilligan,
I'm hungry.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.127
Haven't you given any
       thought about that badge?

16:04.196 --> 16:08.165
Hold on just a minute,
I ain't that hungry.

16:08.234 --> 16:12.503
Skipper, little fellow,
         turn in your star.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.476
[winces in pain]

16:21.581 --> 16:23.314
[duck quacking]

16:23.383 --> 16:26.217
Don't worry, Emily,
    I'm here to protect you.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.193
- Hi, there, Marshal.
     - Howdy, Miss Ginger.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.228
Was just goin'
to fix that lynch mob.

16:38.297 --> 16:40.130
That's the spirit,
              Gilligan.

16:40.199 --> 16:42.299
- Let's drink to that.
     - Oh, I'm sorry.

16:42.368 --> 16:45.102
I got no time to drink.
I've gotta guard my duck.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.004
Just one little drink?

16:47.073 --> 16:49.273
Sorry, but, that's Marshals,
duty comes first.

16:49.342 --> 16:53.177
Just a teenie-weenie
            little-o drink?

16:53.246 --> 16:57.081
Well, maybe just one
teenie-weenie little-o drink.

17:05.124 --> 17:09.492
Just one teenie-weenie
          little-o drink.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.561
One teenie-weenie
little-o drink.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.930
You're right.

17:12.998 --> 17:14.330
I know what're you up to.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.633
Get me drunk,
steal my key, open the cell

17:16.702 --> 17:19.470
and cook yourself a roast duck
 dinner right in my office?

17:19.539 --> 17:21.672
Just for
         the two of us, Marshal.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.773
We'll have a little
            candle light supper.

17:23.843 --> 17:28.145
Just you and me...and that
      roast duck.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.014
What do you say?

17:31.083 --> 17:33.751
I can't.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.053
When the Mayor pinned this
badge on my chest

17:36.122 --> 17:37.654
I made him
two sacred promises.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.390
What promises?

17:39.458 --> 17:42.059
First off, I wouldn't drink
when I was on duty.

17:42.128 --> 17:45.496
Oh, forget the drink, Marshal.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.599
You don't have to drink
         to have a good time.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.300
What was your
                 second promise?

17:50.369 --> 17:53.171
Never to have
a good time.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.143
[door shuts]

17:59.212 --> 18:02.179
Wish I had never made
     that second promise.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.616
Gilligan, the lynch mob
    is comin', the lynch mob.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.118
I'm ready for them.

18:13.860 --> 18:17.828
Emily, Emily, they're comin.

18:17.897 --> 18:21.098
Come on, girl,
        get outta there.

18:21.167 --> 18:24.035
I'm not gonna take a chance.
  If anything happens to me

18:24.104 --> 18:25.903
I know you'll be safe.
     Open the door.

18:25.972 --> 18:29.340
- Here you go, girl.
- You can't go through with it.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.642
I got to, ma'am.
    I didn't mind when they

18:31.711 --> 18:33.744
shot the Mayor and
       burnt the school.

18:33.813 --> 18:37.348
But nobody gets away
  with trying to eat my duck.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.550
But, think about future
 Gilligan, you might be killed.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.619
Oh, I'm sorry, Mary Ann.
    But, that duck

18:41.688 --> 18:43.154
is bigger than
         both of us.

18:43.222 --> 18:46.591
Well, no wonder, the way
    you've been feeding her.

18:56.168 --> 18:58.302
Buenos Dios,
Marshal Gilligan.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.137
Howdy, Senora Howell.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.572
Two men are coming.
I came over to help you.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.608
Help me?

19:03.676 --> 19:06.010
I'm in sympathy
with your cause

19:06.079 --> 19:08.445
and I brought you
a simply marvelous gun

19:08.514 --> 19:10.047
with which you can
defend your duck.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.850
Senora, isn't your husband
      the leader of lynch mob?

19:12.919 --> 19:16.020
Ah, yes,
I do believe he is.

19:16.089 --> 19:17.822
Then what do
                   we have here?

19:17.891 --> 19:22.025
Mamasita Howell's
              famous duck gravy.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.362
I always carry
a pint of it with me.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.499
There he is.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.202
[soft dramatic music]

19:35.208 --> 19:37.241
Let's go get him.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.353
[door shuts]

20:13.612 --> 20:15.980
(Gilligan)
      'Stop right there.'

20:21.320 --> 20:22.419
We want that duck.

20:22.488 --> 20:23.554
That duck is mine.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.389
And we want
                     to eat him.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.558
Come on, Gilligan,
give him up.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.625
Never.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.761
Alright, boys,
                let him have it.

20:30.829 --> 20:31.963
[gunshots]

20:34.400 --> 20:35.566
[gunshots continue]

20:38.303 --> 20:40.804
Missed me.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.239
- Oww.
             - Dit.

20:42.308 --> 20:43.874
[both screaming]

20:43.943 --> 20:49.012
That'll teach you
   to keep away from my duck.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.481
Gilligan,
you were wonderful.

20:51.550 --> 20:54.818
Shucks, it's quiet nothin',
     justice has triumphed.

20:54.887 --> 20:55.820
Yahoo!

20:55.888 --> 20:57.588
[gunshot]

20:57.657 --> 21:00.391
Miss Mary Ann..
        [duck falls]

21:00.460 --> 21:03.694
Oh, no...Emily!

21:04.730 --> 21:07.431
Ah, no.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.503
No, no, no, no.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.571
Gilligan, Gilligan,
          wake up, little buddy.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.139
No, you can't have her.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.143
Gilligan, will you wake up?
     You're having a nightmare.

21:19.212 --> 21:22.880
Oh, hi, Skipper.
What do you want?

21:22.948 --> 21:26.684
Little buddy,
        I-I came after the duck.

21:26.752 --> 21:30.621
Oh, no, Skipper,
no, Skipper, no.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.256
Let's face the facts
            little buddy.

21:32.325 --> 21:34.191
That duck's not gonna
           fly any place

21:34.260 --> 21:35.926
and we all can't starve.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.928
I'm starving,
         I gotta have that duck.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.730
No, Skipper, Skipper.

21:39.799 --> 21:43.767
If it has to be done,
I'd rather do it.

21:43.836 --> 21:47.405
Alright, little buddy.
        But you'll need this.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.476
[duck quacking]

21:54.880 --> 21:59.950
No, I can't do it. Might as
  well admit, I'm a coward.

22:02.354 --> 22:06.957
One of us has to be strong,
  so it's unto you, Emily.

22:09.595 --> 22:13.097
When I turn my back,
  throw yourself at that axe.

22:23.075 --> 22:26.143
But, that was the only
     thing we could do.

22:26.212 --> 22:30.480
She ate our food, she wouldn't
 fly, what good was she to us?

22:30.549 --> 22:31.781
We gave her every chance.

22:31.850 --> 22:35.352
(Gilligan)
       'Come and get it.'

22:35.421 --> 22:39.290
Ha, it maybe a little tough,
  but, I know you'll love it.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.826
Well, let's dig in. Ginger,
you want a drumstick or a wing?

22:42.895 --> 22:45.095
I think I'd rather
       have the message.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.164
Which part do you
       like best, Skipper?

22:47.233 --> 22:49.900
Oh, please, just let
     the other's go first.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.335
What's wrong?

22:51.404 --> 22:52.702
(Gilligan)
  'Oh, we shouldn't feel bad.'

22:52.771 --> 22:56.473
Emily took it like a man.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.774
But nobody's hungry.

22:57.843 --> 22:59.877
I'll just take it back
     to the kitchen.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.479
[duck quacking]

23:02.849 --> 23:03.847
What's that?

23:03.915 --> 23:05.982
I think,
     a seagull with a cold.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.485
- Sound's like a duck to me.
  - No.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.120
- I'm sorry, Skipper.
     - Gilligan!

23:10.189 --> 23:12.957
I tried, Skipper. Honestly,
 I really did. You understand.

23:13.025 --> 23:16.160
I couldn't feel better about it,
little buddy. Where is she?

23:16.229 --> 23:17.627
Oh, she's in
         the clearing.

23:17.696 --> 23:21.198
Well, let's go
        to the clearing.

23:21.267 --> 23:22.933
[duck quacking]

23:24.170 --> 23:26.737
She's eating those
       poisonous plants.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.539
We may eat
      the duck after all.

23:28.608 --> 23:32.075
Emily, stop,
don't eat those.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.310
[duck quacking]

23:33.379 --> 23:36.980
Oh, Emily, here.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.782
I think we're too late.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.952
Put her back down
   on the ground, we'll see.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.286
Here.

23:43.355 --> 23:44.822
[duck quacking]
        Oh!

23:47.226 --> 23:48.959
She's okay,
                     she's okay.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.061
Then we are saved,
 those plants aren't poisonous.

23:51.129 --> 23:54.598
Hooray, well, we eat tonight.
Start picking up plants.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.569
You were real brave
      to eat those plants.

23:58.637 --> 24:01.806
You may be a duck, but,
    you sure aren't chicken.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.715
- Gilligan, I hope you're right.
- I am positive.

24:11.784 --> 24:15.652
Without the string around her,
she'd fly straight as an arrow.

24:15.721 --> 24:17.387
Well, okay then,
       let's let her go.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.257
Okay, Emily, now, if you get
   any trouble, bail out.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.392
Ready, set, go.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.495
[duck quacking]

24:24.563 --> 24:25.930
[cheering]

24:29.935 --> 24:32.102
Oh, I can almost smell
     Huntington wine.

24:32.170 --> 24:36.139
Whoever gets that message,
  better hurry.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.142
Message?

25:05.170 --> 25:06.703
¶ Now this is the
    tale of our castaways ¶

25:06.772 --> 25:08.739
¶ They're here for
       a long long time ¶

25:08.808 --> 25:11.307
¶ They'll have to
   make the best of things ¶

25:11.376 --> 25:12.842
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:12.911 --> 25:15.345
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

25:15.414 --> 25:17.147
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:17.216 --> 25:21.551
¶ To make the others comfortable
In their tropic island nest ¶

25:21.620 --> 25:25.955
¶ No phone, no lights, no motor
car, not a single luxury ¶

25:26.024 --> 25:30.394
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe
   It's primitive as can be ¶

25:30.462 --> 25:32.962
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:33.031 --> 25:34.798
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:34.867 --> 25:39.537
¶ From seven stranded castaways
Here on Gilligan's Isle ¶
