but if--

20:24.480 --> 20:25.879
Yeah.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.917
Just long enough
for the nukes to drop.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.952
The point is, they can turn on,

20:31.080 --> 20:32.832
which means
they can turn on again.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.593

nothing more to it.

a pretty nasty one.

take small bites,

and then they will
come in for the kill.

you got in this town?

23:41.600 --> 23:42.670
About a handful.

You got some gaps
in that southwest wall.

find your mother,

never left Atlanta.

Oh, God!
Please, please, please.

38:07.360 --> 38:08.350
I'm sorry.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.192
Please, no.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.753
(SOBBING)
No.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.553
Jason: Dad.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.150
You look better.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.474
I feel better.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.752
A man just needs a purpose,
is all.

38:50.720 --> 38:51.790
And yours is?

38:54.360 --> 38:58.593
They have
incontrovertible proof.

38:58.760 --> 38:59.795
(LAUGHS)

38:59.920 --> 39:01.240
Do they?

39:02.280 --> 39:09.596
That Monroe and Foster
had WMDs and used them.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.876
Yeah, I know about six people
on the planet

39:14.880 --> 39:17.156
know that's a lie.

39:17.240 --> 39:20.039
Two of them standing
right here in this room.

39:20.120 --> 39:23.431
Just the timing
of their arrival alone

39:23.520 --> 39:28.515
here with handshakes
and smiles.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.949
Just when people
need it the most.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.513
Ain't that perfect?

39:37.640 --> 39:38.869
And I bet you a steak dinner

39:38.960 --> 39:40.633
that Randall Flynn
was in with them.

39:42.120 --> 39:45.272
No, I doubt that these people
are God-fearing Americans.

39:45.360 --> 39:48.955
My guess is that
they're someone else entirely.

39:50.360 --> 39:51.555
It's impressive, though.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.554
Balls on them.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.278
They're responsible
for the bombs...

40:00.360 --> 40:02.271
...and for your mother's death.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.994
I am going to rip them apart
from the inside

40:05.080 --> 40:08.038
until they are begging me
to die.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.990
(HORSE WHINNIES)

40:28.800 --> 40:29.790
That's not good.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.390
Sheriff.

40:53.880 --> 40:54.950
Hello.

40:55.040 --> 40:56.872
I'm Titus Andover.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.150
This is my family.
Welcome.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.396
Welcome, welcome,
welcome, welcome.

41:01.520 --> 41:04.512
Can we get you some sweet tea?

41:16.560 --> 41:19.234
Deputy Martin
scoured the town.

41:19.320 --> 41:22.711
It looks like those whack jobs
are gone for now.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.116
Has anyone seen
Miles or the sheriff?

41:27.440 --> 41:28.953
I'm sorry.
