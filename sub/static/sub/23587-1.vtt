02:02.288 --> 02:05.519
A little heavier
in the shoulders, huh?

02:05.592 --> 02:08.526
Comes from swingin'
that 10-pound sledge.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.529
They all get it.

02:10.597 --> 02:12.588
It's all there.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.767
Do you mind if I look?

02:15.835 --> 02:17.769
No, it's just that...

02:17.837 --> 02:21.830
Not at all. I keep my eye on
all the stuff myself, that's all.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.957
Devereaux.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.759
Let's go.

02:54.407 --> 02:57.843
- Where?
- The governor wants to see you.

02:57.911 --> 03:00.846
I don't wanna see the governor.
I'm through here.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.848
Let's go, partner.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.671
Here's your grub.

03:42.655 --> 03:45.089
Sidewinder.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.149
Thanks.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.757
Good gun.

03:58.304 --> 04:00.295
Nice balance.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.933
Come on over.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.890
Joe Devereaux.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.927
Oh, yes. It'll be just a minute.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.374
The governor'll see you now,
Mr. Devereaux.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.081
Good luck, Joe.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.140
Thanks, Bill.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.958
Glad you came, Joseph.

05:27.026 --> 05:29.756
I couldn't do anything else.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.763
I wanted to talk to you.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.323
The simplest way was to
bring you here. Sit down.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.432
You look different, Joseph.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.441
More mature, I guess.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.603
And, uh, changed.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.614
I suppose three years is bound
to bring some changes...

05:49.682 --> 05:53.118
Look, Governor, you're not interested
in what prison did to me.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.280
Yes, I am.
I'm very interested.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.517
Barbara still hasn't married.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.119
- Anything else?
- Yes, there is.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.297
There's considerably more.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.356
Sit down.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.038
If I told you I brought you here
to keep you from being killed...

06:13.106 --> 06:15.040
you might think me hypocritical.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.600
But for the love and respect I had
for your father and your mother...

06:18.678 --> 06:20.612
My mother?

06:20.680 --> 06:23.114
Never mind.

06:23.182 --> 06:26.117
There's been enough violence
connected with Devereaux Ranch.

06:26.185 --> 06:29.177
I don't want any more.
I won't have any more.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.151
Your brothers are in the next room.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.993
They have a proposition to make to you.
A business proposition.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.998
They assure me it's a good one.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.000
I'd like...

06:42.068 --> 06:44.400
I'd advise you to take it.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.868
Come in.

06:56.849 --> 06:59.784
- Hello, Joe.
- Joe.

06:59.852 --> 07:03.219
I told him, and I'll tell you, Ben...
I'll stand for no trouble.

07:03.289 --> 07:05.382
There won't be any trouble, Governor.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.392
We don't want any, and...

07:07.460 --> 07:09.894
I'm sure Joe doesn't.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.453
- I'll give you 10 minutes.
- Fine.

07:14.133 --> 07:17.068
Well, you look good, Joe.

07:17.136 --> 07:20.071
I'm glad to see
it wasn't too tough on you.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.573
Well, naturally,
I know it wasn't easy...

07:22.642 --> 07:26.237
The governor said you had
a proposition for me. He told me to take it.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.576
What, before you'd even heard it?

07:28.648 --> 07:31.082
He should know better than that.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.914
Besides, this is a family matter, Joe.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.920
We're still your brothers.

07:35.988 --> 07:38.252
Just tell me the proposition.

07:38.324 --> 07:40.417
All right.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.427
You see, Joe...

07:42.495 --> 07:45.931
there have been a lot of,
uh, changes since you went in.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.432
I can see some of'em right here.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.766
- What kind of remark...
- I'll do the talkin', Denny!

07:51.838 --> 07:53.772
Sure, Ben.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.274
That's one of the changes.

07:56.342 --> 07:59.436
Another is that
we run the ranch from town now.

07:59.512 --> 08:02.106
It's gotten too big
to operate from home.

08:02.181 --> 08:04.547
What did you do with my mother?

08:04.617 --> 08:07.552
Well, you know, Joe,
she doesn't like town.

08:07.620 --> 08:11.056
She went back to her own people, Joe.
That's all she wanted.

08:11.123 --> 08:14.058
Anything else, we'd have done it,
just as we will for you.

08:14.126 --> 08:17.562
But, I, uh...
I think you ought to realize...

08:17.630 --> 08:20.861
that we've got different
responsibilities now, Joe.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.868
Devereaux Ranch
isn’t just cattle anymore.

08:23.936 --> 08:26.336
We've got oil leases, mineral rights...

08:26.405 --> 08:28.339
stockholders we have to protect.

08:28.407 --> 08:30.398
Just tell me the deal.

08:32.477 --> 08:34.912
All right, I'll tell you the deal.

08:34.981 --> 08:37.916
It's Oregon.
Brand-new territory.

08:37.984 --> 08:40.919
We'll buy you a spread,
stock it for you and cover your losses...

08:40.986 --> 08:42.921
for three years.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.923
Or else?

08:44.991 --> 08:46.925
There is no "or else."

08:46.993 --> 08:49.257
That's it.

08:49.328 --> 08:51.262
I, uh...

08:51.330 --> 08:53.821
I think that'll get you started.

08:56.168 --> 08:58.602
- What if I don't like Oregon?
- You'll like it.

08:58.671 --> 09:02.038
I hear it's real nice country
up there, Joe.

09:02.108 --> 09:05.043
We worked it out for you
the best we could, Joe...

09:05.111 --> 09:08.205
but, uh, if there's something else...

09:08.281 --> 09:10.715
There is something else.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.717
Three years.

09:12.785 --> 09:14.719
Three years out of my life.

09:14.787 --> 09:18.450
Three years I spent in that stinkin' jail.
Can you give me back those?

09:18.524 --> 09:22.119
No. Not even if I
had 'em to give you.

09:22.194 --> 09:26.688
I lost mine sweatin' out chores for Pa
before you were ever born.

09:28.034 --> 09:30.969
I'm not crying about 'em.
I'm just telling you.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.972
All right, Joe, you've got our offer,
you've got our money.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.203
The train goes through here at 6:00
tonight. Be on it, and the deal stands.

09:44.984 --> 09:47.316
That's not very smart, Joe.

09:48.854 --> 09:52.153
But the rest of the deal stands
if you make that train.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.435
He's real hot, ain't he?

10:04.503 --> 10:06.437
He'll cool down.

10:06.505 --> 10:09.440
When he does, he'll take the deal.
He's too smart not to.

10:09.508 --> 10:11.942
- Ain't that right, Ben?
- I don't know.

10:12.011 --> 10:16.004
But anybody that throws $10,000
in a spittoon makes me nervous.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.007
Pick it up.

10:53.886 --> 10:57.083
He don't look like much, but for the price
he'll get you there and back.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.090
You sure you want that saddle?

10:59.158 --> 11:02.093
Another couple of dollars,
and I can give you a better one.

11:04.897 --> 11:08.560
- What's your hurry?
- Well, Ben said find out where he was goin'.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.594
I know where he's going.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.918
Get on your horse, fellow, and git!

12:02.988 --> 12:05.855
- Joseph, it is you?
- Hello, Two Moons.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.933
The gods, they smile on us this day.

12:16.001 --> 12:17.935
I guess they do.

12:18.003 --> 12:21.803
You missed me by about three inches.
Or maybe you're getting old.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.809
If I want to hit you, I hit you.

12:24.877 --> 12:27.812
- You come home to stay, Joseph?
- I don't know.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.939
Your mother, she is at
the meeting place of our people.

12:30.015 --> 12:31.607
How is she, Two Moons?

12:31.684 --> 12:34.380
She is the same.
She waits for you.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.387
Yeah.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.855
But there's something else
I gotta settle first.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.859
You are alone. If there is need,
I have 20, maybe 30 men.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.361
And have the rest of the tribe
wiped out? No.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.864
- Where you go?
- Up to the home place.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.867
- Good. You talk to Running Wolf...
- I'm not talking to anybody.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.870
The old man's dead. You been listening
to that medicine man stuff too?

12:52.938 --> 12:55.873
- Sometime in the night I hear wolf call.
- You always hear wolves.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.876
Pa never let anybody kill 'em.
You know that.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.935
You wanna ride in with me?

13:02.448 --> 13:06.646
- Well?
- It is fitting you go alone, Joseph.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.710
Superstitious old fool.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.138
Hello, Pa.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.917
I came back.

14:46.986 --> 14:50.922
The old men said
you wouldn't rest easy until I did.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.924
L...

14:52.992 --> 14:56.928
I heard the medicine men think you're
running the hills nights with the wolves.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.987
Maybe you are at that.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.895
What do you want me to do, Pa? Have you got
a sign for me, or you want me to figure this out...

15:39.171 --> 15:41.105
Hold her still.

15:44.376 --> 15:47.368
Just brand 'em.
Don't barbecue 'em.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.185
- ¿Como esta, senor?
- Muy bien, Francisco.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.488
Ah! Manuel.

15:57.556 --> 16:00.218
- Senor Matt. All goes well?
- Yeah.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.157
We'll have the other camps
cleaned up by sundown.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.695
Here too.

16:03.762 --> 16:07.289
Start driving the beef herd
toward the home place tomorrow.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.357
Now, take 'em slow, Man...

16:18.477 --> 16:20.911
They're rustlin' stock
on the east range, Pa!

16:20.980 --> 16:23.915
Johnny Red Eagle was riding herd, and
they shot his horse right out from under him!

16:23.983 --> 16:25.917
He walked into camp this morning
and told Two Moons...

16:25.985 --> 16:27.418
Ben, get a horse.

16:30.189 --> 16:33.681
- You want I get some boys?
- No, no, we'll handle it.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.181
Not a sign of'em.

17:30.249 --> 17:33.184
They kept to the middle
of the stream to cover.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.517
You can't tell whether
they went up or down.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.990
- Horse slipped, no?
- Which way, do you think?

17:51.003 --> 17:53.233
Let's go.

18:05.884 --> 18:07.875
Hey!

18:23.769 --> 18:27.205
Two, three, four...
five I count, Pa.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.299
Six!

18:34.046 --> 18:36.571
- That's Pa!
- Get outta here!

18:59.171 --> 19:01.036
Let's go!

19:01.106 --> 19:03.506
Come on!
Get out of there!

19:06.578 --> 19:09.570
Come on, get up.
You're not hurt.

19:14.119 --> 19:16.053
Cut this steer loose.

19:16.121 --> 19:19.284
Couldn't even change the brand
without blotching it, could you?

19:20.559 --> 19:22.493
I've seen these two before.

19:22.561 --> 19:25.223
We fired 'em last year.
They're no good.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.490
Hey!

19:34.573 --> 19:36.507
Well?

19:36.575 --> 19:38.509
We didn't mean nothin', Pa.

19:38.577 --> 19:42.013
- Just a couple of little old steers.
- Uh-huh. Why?

19:42.081 --> 19:44.015
I don't know.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.017
We needed the money.
That's why.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.019
Money? You got money.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.578
You mean that lousy 40 a month
you give us?

19:51.857 --> 19:54.291
Don't you ever use
that tone with me, boy.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.294
- Pa, we didn't mean nothin'.
- No, I don't suppose you did.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.796
You just figured
you'd steal some cattle and sell 'em.

19:59.865 --> 20:03.801
Of course, anybody within a thousand miles
would know that brand, even raised.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.804
But you figured nobody would have
the guts to tell me that two of my own...

20:06.872 --> 20:09.807
- No, Pa, we didn't even think of that.
- No, I don't think you did.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.810
I don't think the two of you together
could've figured that out.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.847
But somebody figured it out.
Who put you up to it?

20:19.151 --> 20:21.142
Nobody.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.922
Well, it doesn't make any difference.
You did it.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.925
And just to be sure
it wouldn't be a secret...

20:27.993 --> 20:30.086
you had to drag
these two lunkheads in with ya.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.096
- They no talk.
- Let 'em be.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.098
They're not to blame.
Just these two.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.100
Well, what do you want
to do with 'em?

20:36.168 --> 20:39.103
They were caught red-handed
rustling cattle and changing the brand.

20:39.171 --> 20:42.106
If you notify the sheriff,
the whole state'll know about it.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.438
- We could hang 'em right here.
- Cut it out, Pa!

20:47.312 --> 20:49.303
He thinks I'm fooling.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.916
I guess a lot of fellas felt that way...

20:52.985 --> 20:56.477
until we taught 'em that you don't
steal cattle from the Devereaux Ranch.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.991
But the cattle are as much yours
as they are mine...

21:01.059 --> 21:03.186
so the deci...

21:03.262 --> 21:06.254
And they would've
been yours too. L...

21:09.735 --> 21:11.726
What do you think, Ben?

21:13.806 --> 21:15.740
You don't pay 'em enough.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.742
Or you either, huh, Ben?

21:17.810 --> 21:19.744
They get the same as you.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.747
And if you ask me, all three of you
get twice as much as you're worth.

21:22.815 --> 21:26.251
There ain't a man living who can say
that he stole cattle from me.

21:26.318 --> 21:28.718
But you two mushheads thought...

21:30.255 --> 21:33.190
All right, you wanted 'em so bad,
you take 'em.

21:33.258 --> 21:37.160
Take 'em and get out. The money you get
will keep you until you can steal some more.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.464
But remember this...

21:40.532 --> 21:42.693
Don't steal 'em from here.

21:44.436 --> 21:46.370
We can't let him do this.

21:46.438 --> 21:50.602
Why not? I warned 'em
they were only asking for trouble.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.913
Pa, you don't mean this.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.915
They're your own sons!

21:57.983 --> 22:00.918
They're a couple of cheap,
tinhorn cattle thieves.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.853
- Two dead men laying there because...
- You just can't do it!

22:03.922 --> 22:06.413
I did it. Let go, son.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.932
You should have done this
yesterday, my husband.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.994
If I'd done what I should have... If I'd been
half smart, I never would've let you see it.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.674
I don't know why it is
that every wife thinks...

22:23.742 --> 22:26.677
What are you trying to do, kill me?

22:26.745 --> 22:28.474
Finish the telling.

22:28.547 --> 22:31.482
Nothing to tell.
I told you, I sent 'em packing.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.485
Money, they said they wanted.
I pay 'em, don't I?

22:34.553 --> 22:37.545
Besides, they've got everything
they want right here on the ranch.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.791
Well, haven't they?

22:40.859 --> 22:43.794
Perhaps. But I do not think
it is money that they need.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.296
Well, they were stealing cattle to get...

22:46.365 --> 22:48.629
What is it they do need?

22:48.700 --> 22:50.634
They are not my sons.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.636
It is difficult to say...

22:52.704 --> 22:54.968
but I think it is you, my husband.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.770
You have never given them
anything of yourself.

22:57.843 --> 23:01.074
Oh, that's a lot of...
That kind of talk...

23:01.146 --> 23:04.081
I got a big ranch to run,
the biggest in this part of the country.

23:04.149 --> 23:07.641
Besides, I built it all up
for them, haven't I?

23:08.887 --> 23:10.479
Well, all right.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.490
I built it up for myself.
But it's still theirs when I die, isn't it?

23:13.558 --> 23:15.492
Supposing I haven't given them time.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.154
Does that mean they have to grow up
to be cattle thieves?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.629
You are their father.

23:19.698 --> 23:21.666
They want to be part of you.

23:21.733 --> 23:24.167
If you do not give yourself,
they take...

23:24.236 --> 23:27.171
even if it means stealing
something that is yours.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.675
That's Indian talk. I don't understand you
when you talk that way.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.676
You understand.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.178
That is what makes you angry.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.944
That, and because you have sent them away.
They are your sons.

23:39.017 --> 23:43.681
Well, they're not yours, so I don't know why
you're... lf Joe had done a thing like that...

23:43.755 --> 23:47.691
It is because they are not that I have to
try to love them as much as my own.

23:47.759 --> 23:51.695
And you have too. And that must take a power
that I don't know anything about.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.698
As I say, if Joe...
But Joe wouldn't do a thing like that.

23:54.766 --> 23:57.701
He's my son,
yet I do not know what he would do.

23:57.769 --> 24:00.294
He is yours, and you do not.

24:01.306 --> 24:03.240
- Bring them back.
- No!

24:03.308 --> 24:05.799
I sent 'em away, and that's that.

24:08.246 --> 24:10.714
Let me.

24:17.322 --> 24:19.916
- Sore at me?
- No.

24:19.992 --> 24:23.257
It's only because
I do not understand.

24:23.328 --> 24:26.923
You didn't get a very good bargain, did you,
as my little princess?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.933
I have never regretted it.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.993
Not all these years,
you haven't? Hmm?

24:33.438 --> 24:35.429
How have you stayed so beautiful?

24:39.344 --> 24:41.335
Am I?

24:42.347 --> 24:44.076
Still?

24:46.518 --> 24:49.146
You know, the first day I saw you...

24:49.221 --> 24:52.418
riding across the plains
on that little paint pony...

24:52.491 --> 24:54.925
with the antelope-skin shirt
and the beads...

24:54.993 --> 24:57.587
and the feather in your hair...

24:59.097 --> 25:02.191
I thought there was
nothing in the world so beautiful.

25:05.103 --> 25:08.095
I didn't know the half of it.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.014
We have guests for dinner.

25:17.082 --> 25:19.073
- Send 'em home.
- They're already here.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.179
Well, then why don't you
go downstairs and pacify them?

25:24.256 --> 25:25.655
Without you?

25:25.724 --> 25:27.715
What's the matter?
You afraid they'll bite you?

25:27.793 --> 25:31.092
No. They will bow and smile
and be very polite.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.597
- They'd better.
- They know that too.

25:33.665 --> 25:35.599
Are you afraid of them?

25:35.667 --> 25:39.103
- I'm afraid of no one but you, my husband.
- Ohh!

25:39.171 --> 25:41.105
Oh, Princess...

25:41.173 --> 25:44.108
that sounds like
it has a little of the old Irish...

25:44.176 --> 25:47.441
Are you sure there wasn't another Irishman
in your tribe before I came along?

25:47.512 --> 25:50.447
There is no other Irishman
like you, my husband.

25:50.515 --> 25:52.449
Ah!

25:52.517 --> 25:54.508
Princess.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.117
- Did you tell...
- No.

26:27.185 --> 26:30.450
I, uh... Please don't.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.490
Matt!

26:32.557 --> 26:34.889
Senora Devereaux.

26:36.194 --> 26:38.924
- We've been waiting for you.
- Horace, my apologies.

26:38.997 --> 26:40.931
Clem, it's nice to see you.

26:40.999 --> 26:43.934
- Where's Grace? Couldn't she come?
- It's her back again.

26:44.002 --> 26:46.994
- Hasn't been out in a week.
- Must be two weeks since I've seen her.

26:49.641 --> 26:51.575
I haven't met this young lady.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.668
I certainly should never forget it
if I had.

26:53.745 --> 26:57.442
Of course you have, Uncle Matt!

26:57.516 --> 26:59.950
It's not Barbara!
Why, it can't...

27:00.018 --> 27:02.885
Why, Barbara, when you went east
you were this high.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.388
I was a little taller than that.
Good evening, Senora.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.391
Not very much.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.394
My, if the years had just done for me what
they've done... Well, on the other hand...

27:10.462 --> 27:13.397
- You've met my sons, of course.
- Oh, yes. All four.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.802
I sort of expected you two
would still be out with the cattle.

27:16.935 --> 27:19.927
I thought they oughta be here, Pa,
so I brought 'em in.

27:20.005 --> 27:21.939
I see.

27:22.007 --> 27:24.942
- Been entertaining you properly?
- They've been most gallant.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.944
A fine set of boys, Matt.

27:27.012 --> 27:30.277
Yes, Madame Devereaux has done
what she could with their manners.

27:30.348 --> 27:33.784
Of course, if they smack a little bit
of the range still, that's my fault.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.787
Oh, I think they resemble you
amazingly, Uncle Matt.

27:36.855 --> 27:38.789
So handsome and charming.

27:38.857 --> 27:42.122
Your manners certainly haven't been
neglected. Shall we go in to dinner?

27:42.194 --> 27:44.185
May I?

27:49.768 --> 27:51.759
Joe.

27:57.275 --> 27:59.209
Now, what about them?

27:59.277 --> 28:02.144
It was tough, Pa, but I got 'em drunk
and brought 'em in...

28:02.214 --> 28:04.648
I'm not talking about that.
You heard what I said.

28:04.716 --> 28:07.651
You were mad, Pa, and just being bullheaded.
I figured once you...

28:07.719 --> 28:10.654
You figured?
You've got more guts than you have brains.

28:10.722 --> 28:12.656
- One of these days...
- But not tonight, huh, Pa?

28:12.724 --> 28:16.660
You got your good shirt on.
Besides, I think I could lick you anyway.

28:16.728 --> 28:19.492
Oh, that'll be the day, son.

28:19.564 --> 28:21.555
Go on.

28:22.601 --> 28:25.536
That old heifer
never did come back.

28:27.606 --> 28:30.234
That was in the days
before I had a seat in my pants.

28:30.308 --> 28:33.243
But they were pretty good days at that.
Weren't they, Horace?

28:33.311 --> 28:35.745
- What are those you're eating, Uncle Matt?
- These?

28:35.814 --> 28:37.748
They are pickled cactus grapes.

28:37.816 --> 28:40.751
Cactus grapes?
I don't think I've ever seen them.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.753
They probably didn't
have them in the east.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.948
They're wonderful appetizers.
Aren't they, Ben?

28:45.023 --> 28:46.957
Yeah, if you like 'em.

28:47.025 --> 28:50.017
- They're real good, Barbara.
- Try it. Try it.

28:51.029 --> 28:52.963
Don't.

28:53.031 --> 28:54.965
That's a Mexican pepper.

28:55.033 --> 28:57.968
It'll burn the roof of your mouth out.
One of Pa's funny jokes.

28:58.036 --> 29:00.937
The Mexicans grind those things up
for cayenne.

29:01.006 --> 29:03.941
- Is that right, Uncle Matt?
- Yes.

29:04.009 --> 29:05.943
They're not that hot, though.

29:06.011 --> 29:08.445
Joe has a tendency
to be tenderhearted.

29:08.513 --> 29:12.176
- But you eat them.
- I eat anything that doesn't eat me.

29:23.795 --> 29:25.729
Not bad at all.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.731
Holy smoke!

29:27.799 --> 29:29.733
Not hot?

29:29.801 --> 29:31.735
A little.

29:31.803 --> 29:33.737
A little?

29:33.805 --> 29:36.740
Wouldn't admit it
if it tore the roof of her mouth off.

29:36.808 --> 29:38.742
This is quite a girl, Horace.

29:38.810 --> 29:41.574
How come I haven't seen her before,
if she's been here a month?

29:41.646 --> 29:45.582
Well, if you came to town more often,
you might have. I had to bring her out here.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.084
He wouldn't come to town.
He doesn't like us anymore.

29:48.153 --> 29:51.987
You have to run a ranch from the back
of a horse, not from the Cattlemen's Club.

29:52.057 --> 29:55.823
You'd find out about mineral rights,
though, and beef prices.

29:55.894 --> 29:58.829
I get as good a price
as the next man.

29:58.897 --> 30:01.331
- Isn't that right, Ben?
- No.

30:01.399 --> 30:04.334
I can show you the figures.

30:04.402 --> 30:07.337
The boys are giving me
a really bad time tonight.

30:07.405 --> 30:09.839
- Where did you get 'em?
- I asked 'em.

30:09.908 --> 30:13.344
Most of'em are averaging a cent
to a cent and a half a pound better than we are.

30:13.411 --> 30:15.845
What do you think
we oughta do about it?

30:15.914 --> 30:18.849
Open an office in town,
like the rest of'em, watch Chicago prices...

30:18.917 --> 30:21.852
Who do you figure
is gonna run this office in town?

30:21.920 --> 30:24.388
- Well...
- What about Ben? He could do it.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.390
Oh?
Well, I don't know.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.449
He hadn't mentioned it to me.

30:29.627 --> 30:31.561
- Well, now that we...
- He'd like to!

30:31.629 --> 30:34.564
Now, wait a minute!
Let Ben talk for himself. Go ahead, Ben.

30:34.632 --> 30:38.591
Mr. Devereaux,
our friends need more wine.

30:40.238 --> 30:42.672
Ah.
My apologies, madame.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.675
And to you, Barbara.

30:44.743 --> 30:46.677
Uh, vino.

30:46.745 --> 30:49.680
Uh, sometimes the task
of managing four sons...

30:49.748 --> 30:52.683
They all look like
they're able to take care of themselves.

30:52.751 --> 30:54.685
They've been raised to.

30:54.753 --> 30:57.722
Then why wouldn't you be willing to
let one of them take over for you in town?

30:57.789 --> 30:59.620
Barbara, I think we should...

30:59.691 --> 31:02.558
Oh, no. No, no, no.
She's perfectly right.

31:02.627 --> 31:05.562
As a matter of fact, I think that Ben
probably could take over in town.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.565
That would mean giving up part
of the control of the ranch to him.

31:08.633 --> 31:11.568
- Uh-huh.
- And you wouldn't like that a bit.

31:11.636 --> 31:15.072
Uh-uh. And what's more,
I'm not going to do it.

31:15.140 --> 31:18.075
I keep telling myself
he's not ready for it.

31:18.143 --> 31:21.078
But that's just one of the problems you face
when you raise a flock of sons.

31:21.146 --> 31:24.582
When some fortunate man gains your hand
in marriage, remember to have daughters.

31:24.649 --> 31:26.583
Simpler.

31:26.651 --> 31:28.585
And much prettier.

31:28.653 --> 31:33.454
I think I would be better advised
in the choice of who was to be their father.

31:39.030 --> 31:42.522
Pepper was hotter than I thought, Barbara.

31:56.047 --> 31:57.981
- What's that?
- Cold milk.

31:58.049 --> 32:00.483
It's the only thing
that'll cool off those peppers.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.417
They burn like fire, don't they?

32:02.487 --> 32:04.478
I thought my teeth would melt.

32:06.724 --> 32:08.715
Mmm!

32:10.228 --> 32:13.664
Oh, heavens.
Now if the rest of me would only cool off.

32:13.731 --> 32:16.996
Would you like to walk out onto the patio?
The wind's died down.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.059
You don't have to be afraid.

32:29.147 --> 32:32.082
Now, why should I be afraid?

32:32.150 --> 32:34.084
Oh, I don't know.

32:34.152 --> 32:37.087
They seem to think, in town,
that we turned out to be quite a family.

32:37.155 --> 32:39.316
That's one of the reasons
you came out here, isn't it?

32:39.390 --> 32:42.723
- I suppose so.
- Well, do we come up to our reputation?

32:42.794 --> 32:45.729
Your father certainly does.
Does he always act like that?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.731
Pretty much.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.733
He's a bear cat, ain't he?

32:49.801 --> 32:51.735
He's an old tyrant.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.328
But you're crazy about him,
aren't you?

32:54.405 --> 32:56.270
Well...

32:56.341 --> 32:58.275
yeah, I guess I am.

32:58.343 --> 33:00.607
You're not afraid of him either.
The rest of them are.

33:00.678 --> 33:02.543
- I don't know...
- Well, I do.

33:02.614 --> 33:05.674
Your brother Ben is, and the others.
So is my father. It's ridiculous.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.685
I thought it was the peppers
that made you jump him.

33:08.753 --> 33:12.052
He's stubborn, spoiled and mean,
and you all let him get away with it.

33:12.123 --> 33:15.388
But you like him too.
Don't you?

33:15.460 --> 33:19.453
They said in town you turned out to be
the smartest of the lot.

33:20.865 --> 33:22.856
What else did they say?

33:24.102 --> 33:27.367
Oh, that you'd inherited
all his charm.

33:27.438 --> 33:29.429
But I don't see it.

33:32.443 --> 33:34.434
Look closer.

33:40.618 --> 33:43.086
Was that to maintain
the Devereaux tradition?

33:45.023 --> 33:46.718
No.

34:02.507 --> 34:04.668
Maybe we'd better go back in.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.917
Joe, I want you.

34:13.985 --> 34:16.920
My apologies, madame.
There's something wrong with the herd.

34:16.987 --> 34:19.922
If I'm not back in an hour,
Mrs. Devereaux'll show you to your rooms.

34:19.991 --> 34:22.983
Get out of those Sunday clothes
if you're going to work.

34:25.996 --> 34:28.931
- You think loco weed, senor?
- Nah. They'd be all swelled up.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.934
The tongue looks funny, though.

34:31.002 --> 34:33.937
They got funny-lookin' tongues
even when they ain't dead.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.438
- How many, do you think?
- Must be 38, 40.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.440
- Hey, Pa.
- Huh?

34:38.509 --> 34:40.500
- This water smells funny.
- What?

34:40.578 --> 34:43.012
It tastes funny too.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.016
Yeah, like when you's a kid
and put a penny in your mouth.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.018
Yeah.
Kinda coppery.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.021
- They're dumping stuff in this stream.
- That may be it.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.683
- What do they call that stuff?
- I don't care.

34:53.757 --> 34:56.693
But they're dumping it in my stream.
Get your horses.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.195
- Where we goin'?
- To the copper works. Where do you think?

34:59.264 --> 35:02.131
Rout some of your men
and keep all the cattle away from this stream.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.134
- The copper... That's 20 miles!
- What of it?

35:04.202 --> 35:06.136
Well, we ain't had no sleep, Pa.

35:06.204 --> 35:09.696
You didn't think of that when you were on
the east range, changing the brand. Get goin'!

35:25.123 --> 35:27.387
All right, rest 'em.

35:39.003 --> 35:40.937
Uh-uh.

35:41.005 --> 35:43.940
It's coffee with a stick in it.

35:44.008 --> 35:46.442
What you aimin' to do, Pa?

35:46.511 --> 35:48.445
Stop 'em.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.447
- Big outfit.
- So are we.

35:50.515 --> 35:52.449
- What's the matter? You nervous?
- No.

35:52.517 --> 35:55.452
- I just thought we might get smart for once.
- How?

35:55.520 --> 35:57.454
- Get some law in.
- Law.

35:57.522 --> 35:59.456
Get an injunction and stop 'em.

35:59.524 --> 36:01.856
- They're on our land.
- Sure, Pa. That's right.

36:01.926 --> 36:04.918
- Sure. In the meantime, we lose 500 head of...
- Holy smoke!

36:13.471 --> 36:16.406
What's the matter with you, Pa?
That was a lobo.

36:16.474 --> 36:18.908
I saw him.
He wasn't doing any harm.

36:18.976 --> 36:22.241
- He can pull down a full-grown steer.
- He won't unless he's hungry. Now, I've told you...

36:22.313 --> 36:25.908
As long as he's around, a coyote
won't come within 10 miles.

36:25.983 --> 36:28.918
They'll pull down an animal
just to be doing somethin'.

36:28.986 --> 36:30.977
All right, let's go.

36:43.568 --> 36:45.502
The river's full of it.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.561
It's from the mine, all right.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.158
Hold it.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.955
Sorry, boys.
Not today.

37:10.027 --> 37:12.825
My name is Matt Devereaux.
I want to see McAndrews.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.457
Not today.
They're paying off up there. I got my orders.

37:15.533 --> 37:19.094
I don't care what you got.
I'm goin' up there. Now stand aside!

37:19.170 --> 37:22.503
You ain't goin' through this gate, and don't try...

37:28.713 --> 37:30.840
Better get McAndrews.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.401
- Round up the other boys, quick.
- Sure, boss.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.888
Well! Devereaux.
Good to see you.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.390
You don't get around
this way very often.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.893
I'm around here now,
and I'll tell you why.

38:16.961 --> 38:20.897
I lost 40 head of cattle last night. That stuff
you're pouring into the stream poisoned them.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.399
Poisoned?
Well, now, that doesn't sound right.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.403
The stream's supposed to purify itself
every few yards.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.905
I don't know what a stream
is supposed to do...

38:28.973 --> 38:31.908
but it's killing my cattle,
and I want it stopped.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.910
Where you goin', boys?

38:33.978 --> 38:36.674
Well, now, I can see
how you might be annoyed.

38:36.747 --> 38:38.738
Tell you what you'd better do.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.649
Keep your herds away
from that stream for a while...

38:41.719 --> 38:44.552
and I'll write a letter
into the home office in Chicago.

38:44.622 --> 38:46.556
If they'll stand still for the cost...

38:46.624 --> 38:48.558
Ah, you listen to me.

38:48.626 --> 38:53.563
Don't worry about writing any letters into
the home office about my moving my cattle.

38:53.631 --> 38:56.566
The river is on my land.
You're on my land.

38:56.634 --> 38:59.569
You close this operation down
till you find a way to clean up that stream...

38:59.637 --> 39:01.502
or I'll close it for you.

39:01.572 --> 39:04.507
Oh? And just how
do you propose to do that?

39:04.575 --> 39:08.067
Well, the first thing I'll do
is get an injunction against you...

39:08.145 --> 39:10.579
in the United States Federal Court.

39:10.648 --> 39:14.209
Then the next thing I'll do is get
a United States deputy marshal to enforce it.

39:14.285 --> 39:16.219
Mm-hmm.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.221
Well, that's a fair idea.

39:18.289 --> 39:21.986
Course, if you did that
you'd throw all these men out of work.

39:22.059 --> 39:24.994
- They wouldn't like that.
- You're breakin' our hearts.

39:25.062 --> 39:26.996
Another thing...

39:27.064 --> 39:31.160
You gotta remember that
the government's got contracts for our ore.

39:31.235 --> 39:33.726
Think a court would give you
an injunction?

39:35.606 --> 39:38.541
This is the second time
I've wound up with a busted hand.

39:38.609 --> 39:41.544
The first time, when I forgot
to check the mineral rights...

39:41.612 --> 39:44.547
and the second time, of course,
when I didn't realize...

39:44.615 --> 39:47.880
that, naturally, they wouldn't
send a fool out here in charge of this...

39:47.952 --> 39:50.887
Coming from you, sir,
that's a very pleasant compliment.

39:50.955 --> 39:52.889
Now we'll just see who's right.

39:52.957 --> 39:55.892
Now, you listen to me,
you pasty-faced Eastern tinhorn.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.894
You close this operation down...

39:57.962 --> 40:00.897
or I'll come in here
and pull it down around your ears.

40:00.965 --> 40:02.899
And I'll be waiting
right here for you.

40:02.967 --> 40:04.901
You're right about one thing,
Devereaux.

40:04.969 --> 40:08.268
The company didn't send me out here
to be buffaloed by a loudmouthed farmer...

40:08.339 --> 40:11.365
with a squaw for a wife
and a half...

40:12.343 --> 40:14.709
Go ahead.
Pull it.

40:14.779 --> 40:17.509
Draw, and I'll blow your head off.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.516
Cut it out, Joe.
Put it away, Ben.

40:19.584 --> 40:22.018
There's not gonna be
any shootin' around here.

40:22.086 --> 40:25.021
You've been warned.
Close it down, or we'll be back.

40:25.089 --> 40:28.581
And when we come back,
I'll be looking for you. Let's go.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.532
Stay close to me.
Walk slow.

40:50.481 --> 40:52.472
Get 'em.

40:59.757 --> 41:01.622
We ain't got a chance, Pa.

41:01.692 --> 41:03.683
Shut up.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.803
Rush 'em, you fools! Rush 'em!

41:12.803 --> 41:14.600
Rush 'em, you fools! Rush 'em!

41:16.006 --> 41:18.031
Shoot at their feet.

41:20.277 --> 41:22.711
Make for the horses!

41:26.783 --> 41:29.343
- Giddap!
- Hyah! Hyah!

41:29.419 --> 41:33.947
Keep going!

41:43.934 --> 41:46.368
Wreck it!
Tear it down!

41:50.707 --> 41:52.766
Stay there...

41:57.681 --> 42:00.582
- Go!
- Hyah! Hyah!

42:12.229 --> 42:14.220
Hyah!

42:30.113 --> 42:32.104
Whoa. Whoa.

42:41.024 --> 42:42.958
- All here?
- Some hurt. Not bad.

42:43.026 --> 42:44.960
Where'd you come from?

42:45.028 --> 42:47.462
I think maybe trouble.
We follow you.

42:47.530 --> 42:49.964
- We wait. Hear shooting. We come.
- All right, go ahead.

42:50.033 --> 42:51.967
They're not gonna like that, Pa.

42:52.035 --> 42:54.970
No, I'll bet they're not.
Teach 'em a lesson, though.

42:55.038 --> 42:57.973
They'll think twice
before they dump in my stream.

42:58.041 --> 43:00.908
Well, they won't think twice
about startin' legal action.

43:00.977 --> 43:03.411
That's not my worry.
Let Lawton worry about that.

43:03.480 --> 43:05.914
You'd better ride
back to the ranch and tell him.

43:05.982 --> 43:08.416
If he's not there,
go into town and find him.

43:08.485 --> 43:11.420
- I'll ride with you, Joe!
- Hey! You two are gonna ride herd.

43:11.488 --> 43:13.922
We gotta keep the stock
away from the stream.

43:13.990 --> 43:16.652
Holy crow!
Don't he ever give up?

43:25.568 --> 43:27.502
What are you doing here?

43:27.570 --> 43:30.004
Looking at your horses.
Isn't it allowed?

43:30.073 --> 43:32.007
You were in there with King?

43:32.075 --> 43:35.010
He's a stallion.
It's a wonder he didn't kick your head off.

43:35.078 --> 43:37.512
You sound as if
you wished he had.

43:37.580 --> 43:40.014
But he happens to know a lady
when he sees one...

43:40.083 --> 43:42.574
Which is more than you can say
for the rest of us around here.

43:42.652 --> 43:44.586
- You're saying it, not me.
- Where's Lawton?

43:44.654 --> 43:46.519
- Up at the main house?
- No.

43:46.589 --> 43:49.524
He went into town with Dad
early this morning.

43:49.592 --> 43:51.526
What about you?

43:51.594 --> 43:54.529
Oh, I just didn't feel like
getting up that early.

43:54.597 --> 43:57.532
You didn't figure we might be
riding in sometime today, did you?

43:57.600 --> 43:59.534
Well, of all the gall!

43:59.602 --> 44:02.469
For your information, I've already asked
for someone to drive me in.

44:02.539 --> 44:04.473
- Oh.
- Yes.

44:04.541 --> 44:07.476
- Might I ask how you happen to be here?
- Me?

44:07.544 --> 44:09.978
Oh, Pa wanted me
to see Lawton...

44:10.046 --> 44:12.981
and I just had a sneaking hunch,
for one reason or another...

44:13.049 --> 44:14.983
that you might still be here.

44:15.051 --> 44:16.985
And you are, aren't you?

44:17.053 --> 44:18.987
Yes. I'm here.

44:19.055 --> 44:23.492
And you did figure that I might ride in
sometime today, didn't you?

44:23.560 --> 44:25.494
Why?

44:25.562 --> 44:27.553
Why did you ride in?

44:31.334 --> 44:34.667
Ma, tell Pa I'll try to
make it back by suppertime.

44:48.718 --> 44:53.018
I've got a feeling your mother
doesn't approve of this, or of me either.

44:53.089 --> 44:55.023
If she didn't she'd say so.

44:55.091 --> 44:57.025
She never says anything.

44:57.093 --> 45:00.028
But when she looks at you,
she seems to know just what you're thinking.

45:00.096 --> 45:03.725
I used to think that too when I was a kid.
But it's only because she's an Indian.

45:03.800 --> 45:06.234
Oh. I'd almost forgotten that.

45:06.302 --> 45:08.736
But everyone calls her "Senora."
Why?

45:08.805 --> 45:11.239
Oh, people in town
like to pretend she's Spanish.

45:11.307 --> 45:13.741
Figure it looks better,
or Pa likes it, or something.

45:13.810 --> 45:15.744
Pa don't give a rip
what they think.

45:15.812 --> 45:18.747
- What do you mean, "looks better"?
- You know what I mean.

45:18.815 --> 45:21.750
Well, if I did
I wouldn't have asked you.

45:21.818 --> 45:23.752
You've been East a long time...

45:23.820 --> 45:26.755
but you still oughta know that a white man
don't marry an Indian out here...

45:26.823 --> 45:28.757
even the daughter of a chief.

45:28.825 --> 45:31.419
They call him a "squaw man"
and his kids "breeds."

45:31.494 --> 45:33.928
I'm a half-breed.

45:33.997 --> 45:36.932
All right.
But does anyone call you that?

45:37.000 --> 45:39.491
Not since my first day in school.

45:41.504 --> 45:44.996
- It still bothers you, though, doesn't it?
- No. Why should it?

45:46.476 --> 45:49.536
Yeah, l... I guess it does sometimes.

45:53.016 --> 45:55.450
Was your mother really
the daughter of a chief?

45:55.518 --> 45:58.453
Mm-hmm. Him and Red Cloud
just about ran this whole territory.

45:58.521 --> 46:01.388
I was named after a grandfather,
Tuekakas... Chief Joseph.

46:01.458 --> 46:03.392
Mmm! I've heard of him.

46:03.460 --> 46:06.395
Yeah, they weren't too strong
on Pa marrying her either.

46:06.463 --> 46:09.899
A wild Irishman with a few mangy head of
cattle and three motherless kids of his own.

46:09.966 --> 46:12.901
- The old chief didn't figure him much of a catch.
- So?

46:12.969 --> 46:15.904
Well, Pa'd tell it to you with the trimmings,
how he outran an antelope...

46:15.972 --> 46:18.406
rassled a bear
and whipped six braves.

46:18.475 --> 46:20.909
So they took him into the tribe
and he married the princess.

46:20.977 --> 46:24.242
Oh, wonderful!
I'll bet he did it all too.

46:24.314 --> 46:27.750
- What about his family?
- I don't know. I never did hear much about them.

46:27.817 --> 46:30.752
Ellen, his first wife,
she died right after they came out here.

46:30.820 --> 46:33.755
- Came out? From where?
- I don't know. East, I guess.

46:33.823 --> 46:36.758
Seems to me his old man left Ireland
during the potato famine.

46:36.826 --> 46:40.592
Dirt farmer or something. Got kicked in the head
by a mule when Pa was just a pup.

46:40.663 --> 46:42.995
What are you laughing at?

46:43.066 --> 46:45.500
I thought you were worried
about being an Indian.

46:45.568 --> 46:47.502
You just don't like being Irish.

47:09.759 --> 47:12.694
If I were you,
I wouldn't try to rush things.

47:12.762 --> 47:15.560
Let me talk to Devereaux
myself and see if...

47:18.468 --> 47:20.402
There's one of'em now.

47:20.470 --> 47:22.404
Yeah.
So it is.

47:22.472 --> 47:24.406
And isn't that your daughter?

47:24.474 --> 47:26.465
Yes, it is.

47:28.978 --> 47:31.913
Ah, you're making
too much of this, Horace.

47:31.981 --> 47:34.916
They're a little hot under the collar,
but they'll calm down.

47:34.984 --> 47:37.919
Talk to 'em real nice,
and they'll settle.

47:37.987 --> 47:40.922
- They don't want trouble any more than we do.
- They're going to sue you.

47:40.990 --> 47:44.426
They're mad, Matt. You wrecked a building,
banged up half their crew.

47:44.494 --> 47:46.928
Well, they killed
40 head of my cattle.

47:46.996 --> 47:49.430
What do you want me to do,
kiss 'em?

47:49.499 --> 47:52.434
I'll pay for their damages,
if they're fair...

47:52.502 --> 47:56.438
and if they put in a sump
and stop pollutin' my stream.

47:56.506 --> 48:00.442
This business of going to court,
ah, it's a waste of time... theirs and mine.

48:00.510 --> 48:03.377
They don't care about that.
They're out to get you.

48:03.446 --> 48:05.380
This is a big Eastern company.

48:05.448 --> 48:07.882
They don't like people
shooting up their property.

48:07.951 --> 48:10.886
And to prove it, they're going to
make an example out of you.

48:10.954 --> 48:12.888
You think they can?

48:12.956 --> 48:14.890
Well, that depends on...

48:14.958 --> 48:17.051
what happens in court...

48:17.126 --> 48:20.562
what lawyers they bring in,
who the judge is, you know.

48:20.630 --> 48:23.565
Well, you could have
something to say about that.

48:23.633 --> 48:25.567
This is a federal case, Matt.

48:25.635 --> 48:28.570
They'll be bringing in lawyers from the East.
The newspapers'll pick it up.

48:28.638 --> 48:31.573
- Uh-huh.
- If it was just a local thing, we could handle it.

48:31.641 --> 48:34.576
Yeah, uh, Horace, uh...

48:34.644 --> 48:37.078
I don't know, but, uh...

48:37.146 --> 48:39.580
something sounds
a little sour to me.

48:39.649 --> 48:43.085
I tell you, you just made the wrong move
with the wrong people.

48:43.152 --> 48:46.087
I've made a lot of wrong moves, Horace.

48:46.155 --> 48:49.090
It isn't that.
It's you, Horace.

48:49.158 --> 48:52.753
Now, sometimes you've helped me, and sometimes
you haven't been able to. That's all right.

48:52.829 --> 48:57.823
But you're not even makin' a noise now
like you wanted to help me.

48:59.402 --> 49:02.929
You could appoint the judge,
couldn't you, Horace?

49:03.006 --> 49:04.997
Well, I suppose I could.

49:06.342 --> 49:08.276
Wouldn't be quite ethical, but...

49:08.344 --> 49:11.575
Never mind about that.
Let's talk about you and me now.

49:13.182 --> 49:16.674
You know you want something, Horace.
What is it? What do you want?

49:18.254 --> 49:21.246
I want your son Joe
to stay away from my daughter.

49:26.462 --> 49:29.454
I oughta kill you, Horace, right now.

49:34.937 --> 49:37.701
Oh, no. No!

49:37.774 --> 49:40.709
Not you, after all these years.

49:40.777 --> 49:43.405
Matt.

49:45.515 --> 49:48.951
I don't care what the newspapers
and the town say...

49:49.018 --> 49:52.749
or the fact that Lawton's wife
is sick every time we...

49:52.822 --> 49:55.313
But... you.

50:01.831 --> 50:05.096
You never could understand
why I married her, could you?

50:05.168 --> 50:08.934
And you never liked this country out here,
did you, Horace?

50:09.005 --> 50:11.940
That's why you sent the girl back East...

50:12.008 --> 50:14.943
to get her away from the dust
and the dirt and the cattle...

50:15.011 --> 50:17.445
and the Indians
and the half-breeds.

50:17.513 --> 50:20.448
Matt, don't.
You know I like the boy.

50:20.516 --> 50:23.451
But this is something
that's born and bred in me.

50:23.519 --> 50:25.953
I'm 56 years old.
I've tried to change, but...

50:26.022 --> 50:28.957
You're 56 years old,
and you're governor of the state!

50:29.025 --> 50:31.960
And who made you
the governor of the state?

50:32.028 --> 50:35.964
I took you off an accountant's stool,
pulled a pencil from behind your ear...

50:36.032 --> 50:37.966
and made you a politician.

50:38.034 --> 50:40.969
I made you a mayor,
I sent you to Congress...

50:41.037 --> 50:43.301
and I put you in that chair!

50:43.373 --> 50:45.807
Fifty-six. You're...

50:45.875 --> 50:48.810
Fifty-six?
You owe me 30 of'em.

50:48.878 --> 50:50.869
You're right, Matt. I do.

50:52.281 --> 50:54.442
You've done everything but change me.

50:55.551 --> 50:57.485
I wish you had.

50:57.553 --> 51:00.488
Then maybe I will.
Maybe I will.

51:00.556 --> 51:03.821
I can still pull that chair
right out from under you.

51:04.927 --> 51:07.020
Maybe I will.

51:11.334 --> 51:14.269
But there's something
I'm going to do first.

51:14.337 --> 51:17.272
I'm going to tell my boy
that if he wants that girl of yours...

51:17.340 --> 51:19.274
to take her...

51:19.342 --> 51:22.869
if he has to pull her out of the house
by the hair of her head.

51:47.870 --> 51:50.202
Whoo-hoo!

51:54.377 --> 51:56.311
- Ohh!
- Dead heat, huh?

51:56.379 --> 51:58.370
Oh! Guess so!

51:59.949 --> 52:02.884
Come on. I'll show you something.

52:08.558 --> 52:10.549
Go on.

52:11.561 --> 52:14.155
Mmm.
It's wonderful. Cold.

52:14.230 --> 52:15.993
Comes from a way up.

52:16.065 --> 52:18.499
It's beautiful here.
How'd you ever find it?

52:18.568 --> 52:21.002
I've known it
ever since I was a kid.

52:21.070 --> 52:24.005
This is where Pa had
his first powwow with the tribes...

52:24.073 --> 52:27.008
and where he first saw my mother.

52:27.076 --> 52:30.011
There used to be a stone around here
that marked the place...

52:30.079 --> 52:33.014
where the old Indians
shook hands on the deal for the land.

52:33.082 --> 52:36.017
- But I haven't been around for a while...
- Don't you come here often?

52:36.085 --> 52:40.021
- No, it's sort of out of the way, and...
- Then why did you bring me here?

52:40.089 --> 52:42.523
I don't know.
We were out this way, and...

52:42.592 --> 52:44.526
No other reason?

52:44.594 --> 52:47.529
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.

52:47.597 --> 52:50.031
I just don't understand you.

52:50.099 --> 52:53.535
Four days ago you behaved
as if I were a girl in a dance hall...

52:53.603 --> 52:55.537
and now...

52:55.605 --> 52:58.096
Four days ago
I wasn't in love with you.

53:02.311 --> 53:04.245
Was it that hard to say?

53:04.313 --> 53:07.749
- No. But you don't know what you're getting into.
- Yes, I do.

53:07.817 --> 53:09.978
Just as your mother did.

53:34.844 --> 53:37.779
Don't you think I oughta
at least go in and talk to him?

53:37.847 --> 53:40.281
Nope. Don't you start
getting honorable.

53:40.349 --> 53:42.681
I need time to work on him.

53:45.521 --> 53:47.455
Unless you really want to.

53:47.523 --> 53:49.514
I'd rather rassle a bear.

54:33.336 --> 54:35.327
Joe!

54:44.080 --> 54:46.514
Come in here, Joe.
This concerns you too.

54:46.582 --> 54:50.018
The mining company has filed a claim
against us in the federal district court.

54:50.086 --> 54:52.020
Clem thinks we're in real trouble.

54:52.088 --> 54:55.023
I said you were
if they get a judgment against you.

54:55.091 --> 54:57.821
- I don't know that they will.
- Why bother with it?

54:57.893 --> 55:00.020
Because no lawyer
can guarantee what a jury will do.

55:00.096 --> 55:02.963
As I said, if Horace
were appointing the judge...

55:03.032 --> 55:05.967
Well, he isn't!
And I'm not gonna ask him to.

55:06.035 --> 55:08.970
All right.
I still think we've got a good case.

55:09.038 --> 55:11.472
If I didn't, I'd have told you so.

55:11.540 --> 55:14.475
But I want you to be protected
against any eventuality.

55:14.543 --> 55:17.478
You insure yourself
against accident and death, don't you?

55:17.546 --> 55:19.741
- No!
- Well, what is it, Mr. Lawton?

55:19.815 --> 55:22.750
Well, I'm trying to get him to split
the property up between you four boys...

55:22.818 --> 55:25.753
so that he won't be the sole owner.

55:25.821 --> 55:28.221
You're wasting your time
explaining it, Mr. Lawton.

55:28.290 --> 55:31.225
He doesn't trust any of us
with more than $40 a month. Let's go.

55:31.293 --> 55:33.727
Sit down!

55:33.796 --> 55:37.095
- Well, what about Ma? Couldn't she?
- No, Joseph.

55:37.166 --> 55:41.432
Well, uh, you see, Joe, it's, uh...

55:41.504 --> 55:44.871
The government
doesn't allow an Indian to hold land.

55:46.008 --> 55:47.942
What about me?

55:48.010 --> 55:49.944
Well, that's different. You can.

55:50.012 --> 55:52.947
What difference does it make?
He's not gonna turn anything over to anybody.

55:53.015 --> 55:55.950
I'll make the decisions around here.
Now clear out, all of you.

55:56.018 --> 55:58.009
I'll think it over.

56:02.625 --> 56:04.559
Oh, Joe?

56:04.627 --> 56:06.686
Come here a minute, will you.

56:08.998 --> 56:11.432
Joe, there's something
I want to ask you.

56:11.500 --> 56:13.491
Yes, Pa?

56:18.140 --> 56:20.631
Never mind.
It's not important.

56:51.473 --> 56:55.773
I take it the death of these 40 cattle
was an important matter to you.

56:55.844 --> 56:59.143
The death of one cow
is important to a cattleman, sonny.

56:59.214 --> 57:01.978
Important enough to send you
riding to the copper mine...

57:02.051 --> 57:04.952
where at least a dozen men
were subsequently injured?

57:05.020 --> 57:07.250
- Yep.
- Am I to understand from this...

57:07.323 --> 57:12.260
that you consider the lives of 40 cattle
more important than the lives of 12 men...

57:12.328 --> 57:16.025
Objection. The prosecution
is attempting to discredit the witness...

57:16.098 --> 57:19.795
Aw, let him go. I'm perfectly willing
to answer any question.

57:19.868 --> 57:23.429
You know, on the face of it,
that sounds like pure nonsense...

57:23.505 --> 57:27.737
but I know the difference between cattle
and people, as any man can tell you.

57:27.810 --> 57:30.938
Thank you.

57:31.013 --> 57:34.949
How many head of cattle does your ranch
support at this time, Mr. Devereaux?

57:35.017 --> 57:36.951
Oh, 45,000, 50,000.

57:37.019 --> 57:40.216
Is that the closest figure
you can give me?

57:40.289 --> 57:43.816
There are the books of the Devereaux Ranch.
Why don't you look it up?

57:43.892 --> 57:47.089
I don't want to look it up.
I want you to tell me.

57:47.162 --> 57:50.757
Well, then you'd better change
the tone of your voice, sonny.

57:50.833 --> 57:53.597
- Will Your Honor direct the witness to answer?
- I already have.

57:53.669 --> 57:58.163
Mr. Van Cleve, unless you have
a specific reason for pursuing this line...

57:58.240 --> 58:01.004
- the books...
- I have a very specific reason, Your Honor.

58:01.076 --> 58:04.876
The defense has continually
stressed the importance of 40 animals...

58:04.947 --> 58:07.882
yet the witness is unable
to tell me within 5,000 head...

58:07.950 --> 58:10.384
Objection.
Prosecution is again attempting...

58:10.452 --> 58:13.285
to discredit the witness
by indirect examination.

58:13.355 --> 58:14.583
Sustained.

58:14.657 --> 58:17.524
Your Honor, I don't know about
all this legal hocus-pocus...

58:17.593 --> 58:20.221
but if this fellow here
wants to know about my cattle...

58:20.295 --> 58:22.889
I'm perfectly willing to tell him.

58:22.965 --> 58:25.559
I don't keep any books in my head...

58:25.634 --> 58:30.230
but I can tell you that every cow
on my ranch is important to me.

58:30.305 --> 58:32.671
Important to a lot
of other people too.

58:32.741 --> 58:35.676
I ship 10,000 head
to Kansas City every year.

58:35.744 --> 58:38.907
My beef goes into every
city and state in the East...

58:38.981 --> 58:41.973
feeds over 200,000 people.

58:42.051 --> 58:44.485
Now, that's my line of work, sonny.

58:46.822 --> 58:50.189
I'm sure we're all very grateful
for this additional information.

58:50.259 --> 58:53.786
But could we confine ourselves
to specific questions and answers?

58:53.862 --> 58:55.796
Thank you.

58:55.864 --> 59:00.233
Now, you've already stated you've built up
your ranch over a period of 25 years?

59:00.302 --> 59:02.167
Approximately.

59:02.237 --> 59:07.038
And during this time, you've had other
disputes over prior claims and water rights?

59:07.109 --> 59:09.873
- Plenty.
- Were they settled in court?

59:09.945 --> 59:13.540
No, no. No. This is the first time
I've ever been to court.

59:13.615 --> 59:16.277
Usually the men I had to deal with...

59:16.351 --> 59:19.684
were men enough to stand up
and argue it out face to face.

59:19.755 --> 59:24.351
I see. Uh, do you happen to remember
the name of Lucius Hennaberry?

59:24.426 --> 59:26.360
Yes, I remember him.

59:26.428 --> 59:29.864
And do you remember shooting him
in White's Saloon in this city on the...

59:29.932 --> 59:32.366
Yes, in a fair fight.
He had a gun.

59:32.434 --> 59:36.427
Object. Your Honor, I can see no possible
reason for this line of questioning. I demand...

59:36.505 --> 59:39.440
It's an integral part of the case...

59:39.508 --> 59:42.238
and if the court will allow me
to proceed, I'll so demonstrate.

59:42.311 --> 59:44.575
- Proceed.
- Thank you, sir.

59:44.646 --> 59:49.413
Now, the dispute between you
and Hennaberry was over water rights?

59:49.485 --> 59:52.579
No, not over water rights.
Just over water.

59:52.654 --> 59:56.920
Luke had a trail herd.
Said he was gonna water it on my ranch.

59:56.992 --> 59:59.688
He didn't.

59:59.762 --> 01:00:03.254
In the light of what subsequently happened,
that seems quite obvious.

01:00:03.332 --> 01:00:06.927
Water seems to play a tremendously
important part in your life, Mr. Devereaux.

01:00:07.002 --> 01:00:08.936
I don't quite understand this.

01:00:09.004 --> 01:00:12.963
Well, seeing as you came out here
on a train, all nice and comfortable-like...

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:15.100
why, I can understand that.

01:00:15.177 --> 01:00:19.409
But, you see, I didn't.
I packed in here with a wife and three kids.

01:00:19.481 --> 01:00:21.608
The first year I lost half my herd...

01:00:21.683 --> 01:00:24.948
and the second year I lost my wife
because there was no water.

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:29.047
Yes, water's important to me,
just like it is to everybody else in the state...

01:00:29.124 --> 01:00:31.456
because without water
there wouldn't be any state!

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:33.461
- Your Honor, please...
- Now wait a minute!

01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:35.793
You asked me a question.
I'll answer it.

01:00:35.864 --> 01:00:38.230
You can bet your hat
water's important to me...

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.734
as it is to everybody else in the state.

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.828
'Cause every drop that's on my ranch...

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:45.271
I either dug for or channeled it in.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.968
Now when you're back on that train,
ridin' out of here...

01:00:48.043 --> 01:00:50.773
over the right of way that I gave 'em,
think it over.

01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:56.516
I'm perfectly willing to concede Mr. Devereaux's
contribution to his native state...

01:00:56.585 --> 01:01:01.113
but it is the contention of the prosecution
that this does not give him the right...

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:03.988
- to flout the laws of this state or...
- Object.

01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:06.755
Sustained. Just keep
to direct questioning, Mr. Van Cleve.

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.524
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

01:01:08.597 --> 01:01:10.531
I now ask you, sir...

01:01:10.599 --> 01:01:16.037
do you remember the names Charlie Munger,
Red Dog Johnson or Carlos Ramirez?

01:01:16.104 --> 01:01:20.939
- No.
- The incident may be too trivial to recall.

01:01:21.009 --> 01:01:25.446
But isn't it true that you
summarily hanged all three of these men...

01:01:25.514 --> 01:01:27.607
They were stealing my cattle.

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:30.413
- I thought you didn't remember them!
- I didn't ask their names.

01:01:30.485 --> 01:01:33.283
- You just hung them.
- By the neck until they were dead.

01:01:33.355 --> 01:01:35.789
- They were thieves.
- I see.

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:40.795
Isn't it true that Charles Malone
was sheriff of this county at that time?

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.798
- I guess he was.
- Did you make any effort to contact him?

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.800
- No.
- Why not?

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.802
He was 40 miles away and drunk.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.805
- Did you know this for a fact, Mr. Devereaux?
- I knew Charlie Malone.

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:52.966
And let me ask you this, Mr. Devereaux.

01:01:53.041 --> 01:01:57.171
Have you ever, during your years on Devereaux
Ranch, had recourse to the authorities?

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:59.714
- Objection!
- If I've needed the authorities, I've asked for 'em.

01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:01.646
Why didn't you ask for them
two weeks ago Thursday?

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:03.685
I didn't think I needed 'em!

01:02:03.752 --> 01:02:05.686
Order! Order!

01:02:05.754 --> 01:02:10.157
Now, if there's any more of this,
I'll see you two gentlemen in my chambers.

01:02:10.225 --> 01:02:14.559
And if you can't restrain yourself,
Mr. Devereaux, I'll hold you in contempt.

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:16.564
Proceed.

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:20.728
You say you've asked for the authorities
when you've needed them.

01:02:20.802 --> 01:02:23.498
- That's right.
- Then may I ask, did you make any attempt...

01:02:23.572 --> 01:02:27.133
to notify the present sheriff of this county
on the morning in question?

01:02:27.209 --> 01:02:29.143
- No.
- Why not?

01:02:29.211 --> 01:02:31.441
Because I didn't think
it was necessary.

01:02:31.513 --> 01:02:34.277
Under direct examination,
you stated that it was your intention...

01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:37.944
to discuss the affair with McAndrews
and arrive at a sensible solution.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.648
- Do you still say that this was your intent?
- Yes.

01:02:40.722 --> 01:02:44.214
Then may I ask how it happened that 20 minutes
after you arrived at the copper mine...

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:47.387
your foreman appeared
with 30-odd armed men?

01:02:47.462 --> 01:02:49.623
Maybe he thought there
was going to be trouble.

01:02:49.698 --> 01:02:53.327
Didn't he know there was going to be
trouble, and didn't you order him to be there?

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:55.393
No, I did not!

01:02:55.470 --> 01:03:00.407
I see. Is it customary on Devereaux Ranch
for a foreman to proceed without orders?

01:03:00.475 --> 01:03:03.569
- No, it isn't customary, but...
- Yes, Mr. Devereaux?

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:08.642
- I didn't say anything to him.
- I see.

01:03:08.717 --> 01:03:11.618
Now suppose I didn't believe that?

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:15.851
Suppose I said that you deliberately
went there to cause trouble...

01:03:15.924 --> 01:03:19.257
to bully and threaten and force McAndrews
into an open fight?

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:22.525
Suppose I say that you're lying
when you deny this, Mr. Devereaux?

01:03:22.597 --> 01:03:25.691
Then I would tell you to get a gun
or get out of town...

01:03:25.767 --> 01:03:28.395
because the minute I get
off this witness stand...

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:30.734
I'm gonna chase you
until your heels smoke!

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:32.637
- Go get 'im!
- That a boy, Matt.

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:35.006
Order! Order!

01:03:36.845 --> 01:03:39.780
Mr. Devereaux,
I hold you in contempt.

01:03:39.848 --> 01:03:42.783
This court will be
in recess for an hour...

01:03:42.851 --> 01:03:45.149
and if there's
any further disturbance...

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.246
the rest of the proceedings
will be conducted behind closed doors.

01:03:51.226 --> 01:03:53.160
Matt.

01:03:55.263 --> 01:03:58.494
Well, that did it.
He hasn't got a chance.

01:03:58.567 --> 01:04:01.559
- What are we gonna do?
- What can we do?

01:04:01.636 --> 01:04:04.969
Well, Lawton said they had to prove him
solely responsible.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.907
- Well, he was, wasn't he?
- I don't know. We were all with him.

01:04:07.976 --> 01:04:11.275
- Now, wait a minute. I never asked to go.
- Me neither.

01:04:11.346 --> 01:04:14.144
- They'll put him in jail.
- Look, Joe.

01:04:14.216 --> 01:04:17.447
- You know I'd do anything I could to help him.
- So would I, Joe.

01:04:17.519 --> 01:04:20.647
- But we can't just...
- It'd be perjury. They'd get us in a minute.

01:04:20.722 --> 01:04:22.986
That's right.

01:04:23.058 --> 01:04:26.516
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna get a smoke.

01:04:26.595 --> 01:04:28.927
Me too.

01:04:28.997 --> 01:04:32.899
- Hmph!
- We gotta do something, Ben.

01:04:32.968 --> 01:04:34.902
- Why?
- Ben, it's Pa.

01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:38.269
- If they put him in jail, it'll kill him.
- No, not him.

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.774
We gotta do something, Ben.
We owe it to him.

01:04:40.842 --> 01:04:43.310
Maybe you do, Joe, but not me.

01:04:43.378 --> 01:04:46.006
You heard him up there te...

01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:49.448
You heard him telling about
losing his cattle...

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:52.453
and his wife
and going it alone with three kids.

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:56.787
Well, what do you think we were doing
while he was busy building up the state?

01:04:56.858 --> 01:05:00.624
I worked 16 hours a day for him
when I was 10 years old...

01:05:00.695 --> 01:05:05.394
and all he ever did from that day to this
was treat me like a hired hand.

01:05:05.467 --> 01:05:08.368
- But, Ben, listen...
- No, no, Joe. You don't know anything about this.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:11.270
You came along later
when things were good.

01:05:11.339 --> 01:05:14.103
So you figure you owe him something.

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:17.441
All right, go ahead.
Do anything you like.

01:05:19.781 --> 01:05:23.808
You're his little pet.
You always were.

01:05:35.597 --> 01:05:38.532
- It looks bad, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.127
- I'm sorry about the judge.
- Yeah, he's tough.

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:44.968
- I mean about Dad.
- What about him?

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:49.670
Well, about him having the fight with your
father and refusing to appoint the judge.

01:05:49.744 --> 01:05:52.178
Fight with Pa? What about?

01:05:52.247 --> 01:05:55.011
Us. Well, was it?

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:58.280
L... I thought he must have told you.

01:05:58.353 --> 01:06:00.844
- Where are you going?
- I gotta see Lawton.

01:06:11.733 --> 01:06:13.667
Well?

01:06:13.735 --> 01:06:16.203
It's all right.
I made a deal with them.

01:06:16.271 --> 01:06:18.739
You'll have to give up
the land the mine is on.

01:06:18.807 --> 01:06:21.173
- Give up the land?
- You'll go to jail if you don't.

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:23.803
- Now, look...
- Are you gonna listen to me or aren't you?

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:27.280
- All right.
- You'll give them clear title to the mine...

01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:30.614
make restitution for the injured men
and pay the costs on the wrecked building.

01:06:30.685 --> 01:06:32.744
- We can work it out later.
- Oh, I'll bet. I'll bet.

01:06:32.821 --> 01:06:35.415
- That wrecked building is worth about...
- There's one more thing.

01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:37.754
- I'm gonna put Joe on the stand.
- Why?

01:06:37.826 --> 01:06:39.760
Somebody has to take
responsibility for that fight.

01:06:39.828 --> 01:06:43.161
- Not Joe! Not Joe!
- Now wait a minute! I just talked to him.

01:06:43.231 --> 01:06:46.496
He wants to do it. He says McAndrews
called him a half-breed...

01:06:46.568 --> 01:06:48.502
and he was the first one to pull a gun.

01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:52.301
I don't care what he said.
Joe is not going on the stand.

01:06:52.374 --> 01:06:56.868
Look, Matt. This is a deal.
Somebody has to do this.

01:06:56.945 --> 01:06:59.675
You just destroyed
any chance you had.

01:06:59.748 --> 01:07:03.184
Now, if I put Joe on and they
find against him, we can appeal it.

01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:07.187
If you turn over the land and make financial
restitution, they won't contest the appeal.

01:07:07.255 --> 01:07:11.453
The worst that can happen is that Joe
will be held here till we get a new trial.

01:07:11.526 --> 01:07:13.824
- I don't like this.
- I don't ask you to like it.

01:07:13.895 --> 01:07:16.830
I'm just asking you for once in your life
to take some advice!

01:07:16.898 --> 01:07:20.925
The court is now in session.
Please come to order.

01:07:22.971 --> 01:07:26.270
I'm going back in there
and call the boy to the stand...

01:07:26.341 --> 01:07:29.071
and if you say one word
now or until after the appeal...

01:07:29.144 --> 01:07:32.238
I'll guarantee you it'll mean
at least 10 years behind the bars.

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:34.248
Now remember that!

01:07:39.487 --> 01:07:41.682
Call Joseph Devereaux.

01:07:41.756 --> 01:07:46.125
Defense calls Joseph Devereaux.
Take the stand, please.

01:07:54.869 --> 01:07:59.499
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

01:07:59.574 --> 01:08:02.270
and nothing but the truth?

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:24.227
Come on, Pa. There ain't no more
we can do around here.

01:08:24.299 --> 01:08:28.759
Get away from me.
I don't wanna talk to any of you.

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:30.930
Get away from me!

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.938
You are making yourself ill,
my husband.

01:09:41.009 --> 01:09:43.738
Please. This will pass.

01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:46.576
Two Moons said Lawton
brought some papers.

01:09:46.648 --> 01:09:48.912
They are here.
I will get them. And food.

01:09:48.983 --> 01:09:51.247
- No, no. No food. Just the papers.
- But you must eat.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:53.912
I sent Two Moons
for Ben and the others.

01:09:53.988 --> 01:09:56.957
They are still your sons,
my husband.

01:09:59.494 --> 01:10:02.759
Please send them to me
when they come, Senora.

01:10:22.584 --> 01:10:24.779
You wanted us?

01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:29.017
No, I don't want you.
I told you to come here. Sit down.

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:32.326
Go ahead.

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:40.760
Well, what is it, Pa?

01:10:40.835 --> 01:10:44.100
Papers. Lawton wrote 'em.

01:10:44.172 --> 01:10:47.471
He says it's an agreement
to keep Joe out of jail.

01:10:47.542 --> 01:10:50.067
You own the property,
so you sign 'em.

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:52.272
Here, you can make your mark.

01:10:52.347 --> 01:10:55.009
- I can write.
- Uh-uh.

01:10:55.083 --> 01:10:57.017
How much, Pa?

01:10:57.085 --> 01:11:02.216
Eighty thousand cash
and the mine property. Sign it.

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:07.227
No. It's too much, Pa.
Get 'em to cut it down.

01:11:07.295 --> 01:11:12.232
Why, you... This is
to keep Joe out of jail.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:15.201
- Sign it!
- No!

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.704
We're not gonna sign it, Pa.

01:11:19.641 --> 01:11:22.405
You'll sign these papers,
or I'll skin the lot of you.

01:11:22.477 --> 01:11:25.742
We decided we're not gonna sign.
It's too much money.

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.805
Joe'll only get six or seven months...

01:11:27.882 --> 01:11:30.112
Sign it!

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:34.588
Now, take it easy, Pa. It won't do you
any good to get yourself all wound up...

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.680
Get him to bed.
I'll send for the doctor.

01:12:09.991 --> 01:12:14.223
You! Devereaux! Come on down!

01:12:23.438 --> 01:12:26.999
You got a visitor.
A pretty one.

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.811
- No.
- Got orders to take you in, Joe.

01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:32.870
Don't give me no trouble.

01:12:50.031 --> 01:12:53.262
- Joe?
- Yeah, it's me.

01:12:54.736 --> 01:12:56.670
- Get out.
- Can't, ma'am.

01:12:56.738 --> 01:12:59.229
- Orders are to stay with the prisoner.
- Get out now!

01:13:06.781 --> 01:13:11.081
Joe, what's the matter?
What are they doing to you?

01:13:11.152 --> 01:13:14.315
Nothing.
Nobody's doing anything to me.

01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:16.584
I'm just working, and it's hot.

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:19.718
- I don't understand, Joe.
- Look, I'm a convict.

01:13:19.794 --> 01:13:24.424
I live here, and I work and eat and sleep
in these stinkin' clothes.

01:13:24.499 --> 01:13:29.061
Oh, my darling.
As if that could...

01:13:33.508 --> 01:13:37.444
You shouldn't have come here.
Don't do it again.

01:13:37.512 --> 01:13:41.710
Shouldn't have come?
Why not?

01:13:41.783 --> 01:13:45.617
Three years isn't forever, Joe,
and no matter how hard it is...

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:50.124
It ain't hard. It's just being here
and not being able to get out.

01:13:51.759 --> 01:13:54.091
Is it your father?

01:13:54.162 --> 01:13:56.596
He's been sick,
but he's being well taken care of...

01:13:56.664 --> 01:13:59.258
Look, look. I know all about it.
Two Moons has been here.

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:01.700
I know what they're doing
to the old man.

01:14:01.769 --> 01:14:04.237
They're killing him,
just little by little, day by day.

01:14:04.305 --> 01:14:06.466
They're tearing him apart
while I sit here in this...

01:14:06.541 --> 01:14:08.475
Joe, stop it!

01:14:08.543 --> 01:14:11.137
Stop thinking about your father
and your brothers...

01:14:11.212 --> 01:14:13.146
and the whole crazy
Devereaux Ranch.

01:14:13.214 --> 01:14:15.682
- Forget it. You've got your own life.
- Forget it?

01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:17.775
That's the only thing
that keeps me going.

01:14:17.852 --> 01:14:21.253
You can't just sit here and brood
for three years. It's insane.

01:14:21.322 --> 01:14:24.485
Joe, please.

01:14:24.559 --> 01:14:26.550
When you get out, we'll go away...

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.721
just the two of us, out of the state.

01:14:28.796 --> 01:14:30.730
- Anyplace...
- Stop it!

01:14:30.798 --> 01:14:34.461
You're going to be on the outside,
with people, free to move around.

01:14:34.535 --> 01:14:37.333
- I can wait.
- Maybe you can.

01:14:37.405 --> 01:14:40.101
But I'm not so sure about me.

01:14:40.174 --> 01:14:42.404
When I see you...

01:14:51.519 --> 01:14:56.047
Now do you understand?
Don't come here again.

01:15:13.975 --> 01:15:15.943
Stay here.

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:23.751
- He's coming.
- I know he's coming. But when? I want him now.

01:15:23.818 --> 01:15:28.755
He's here. Please, my husband,
no more quarreling.

01:15:28.823 --> 01:15:32.725
Try to understand him a little.

01:15:41.736 --> 01:15:43.670
Hello, Ma.

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:46.740
Pa.

01:15:48.876 --> 01:15:51.811
Leave us alone,
will you, Senora?

01:16:00.421 --> 01:16:02.286
Sit down, Ben.

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:04.291
This is all right.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.655
What's on your mind, Pa?

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.663
The land.

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:13.997
They tell me you're
selling some of it off to an oil company.

01:16:14.068 --> 01:16:17.060
- That's right.
- Why?

01:16:17.138 --> 01:16:19.698
We need the money
to operate with.

01:16:19.774 --> 01:16:22.299
To operate that office in town?

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.311
Yeah.

01:16:25.613 --> 01:16:27.979
Why didn't you tell me?

01:16:28.049 --> 01:16:29.983
You wouldn't like it...

01:16:30.051 --> 01:16:34.249
and the doc says
it's, uh, bad for you to get riled up.

01:16:34.322 --> 01:16:38.725
Yeah. You're real concerned
about my health, aren't you?

01:16:42.296 --> 01:16:45.094
I don't like it.
I don't like selling the land.

01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:48.260
It's good business for the ranch.

01:16:48.336 --> 01:16:50.531
I'm sellin' it, Pa.

01:16:54.809 --> 01:16:57.369
Well, it's yours to sell.

01:16:57.445 --> 01:17:01.404
I spent my life building it up for you...
you and the others... but...

01:17:05.386 --> 01:17:09.720
I've been rough on you, Ben,
because you were the oldest.

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:13.921
I guess I thought
I could expect more from you.

01:17:13.995 --> 01:17:18.329
I never did this before,
but I'm doin' it now.

01:17:18.399 --> 01:17:21.163
I'm askin' you, Ben.

01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:25.864
Give up the sale, will you?

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:29.109
No.

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:32.846
It figured.

01:17:34.482 --> 01:17:37.747
I always knew there was
somethin' between us.

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:42.313
What is it, Ben? What is it?
Joe, maybe, huh, Ben? Joe?

01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:45.518
'Cause he's smarter
than the rest of you...

01:17:45.593 --> 01:17:50.087
and because he stood up to me
when the rest of you were afraid to.

01:17:50.164 --> 01:17:52.724
You hate Joe, don't you, Ben?

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:58.332
No. No, l... I never hated Joe.

01:17:58.406 --> 01:18:02.467
Me then, huh?
But I'm no trouble to you now, Ben.

01:18:02.543 --> 01:18:04.534
No, not now!

01:18:04.612 --> 01:18:08.241
Because you're old
and crippled and sick!

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:12.514
So now you call me in
and ask me something.

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:15.249
You're a little late, aren't you, Pa?

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:19.123
Did you ever ask me how I'd like
an Indian stepmother after Ma died?

01:18:19.193 --> 01:18:23.220
Or how I liked doing all the chores
and taking care of Mike and Denny besides?

01:18:23.297 --> 01:18:25.731
Did you ever ask me how
I liked quittin' school...

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.268
and goin' to work for you
as an ordinary hand?

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:32.033
Did you ever in your life
ju-just ask me how I felt...

01:18:32.106 --> 01:18:35.200
or-or what I thought,
what I wanted?

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:39.310
No, you didn't.

01:18:40.815 --> 01:18:45.752
So it's... it's just a little late
for askin' now, Pa.

01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:52.024
Yeah.

01:18:52.093 --> 01:18:54.994
But the gate
was always open, Ben.

01:18:55.062 --> 01:18:58.623
You could've packed up and left.
I would've understood that.

01:18:58.699 --> 01:19:00.530
I did it myself.

01:19:04.071 --> 01:19:08.405
I always used to think there
was too much of me in you...

01:19:08.476 --> 01:19:10.706
for us to hit it off...

01:19:10.778 --> 01:19:14.111
but I know now that
that was wrong.

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:16.616
There wasn't enough of me in you.

01:19:16.684 --> 01:19:19.050
And now I'm tellin' you again, Ben...

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.248
I'm not askin' you.
I'm tellin' you.

01:19:22.323 --> 01:19:25.952
You're not gonna sell
any of the Devereaux Ranch...

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:28.461
because I'll stop you, Ben.

01:19:28.529 --> 01:19:31.191
- I'll stop you...
- Sit down, Pa.

01:19:32.366 --> 01:19:35.665
You're not tellin' anybody
anything anymore.

01:19:35.736 --> 01:19:40.503
I run Devereaux Ranch,
and I run it the way I like.

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:46.104
And right now
I'm ridin' into town to sign a deal.

01:19:59.927 --> 01:20:02.361
Senora!

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:04.990
Two Moons!

01:20:07.935 --> 01:20:09.869
Two Moons, get my horse.

01:20:09.937 --> 01:20:12.269
Senor Matt, to ride the horse is death.

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:15.571
He's right.
It will kill you, my husband.

01:20:15.643 --> 01:20:18.544
What difference does it make now?

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:21.946
If you die, I die.

01:20:24.418 --> 01:20:28.115
Senora, this must be done.

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:31.482
You understand?

01:22:12.326 --> 01:22:15.022
Hey, Ben! Ain't that Pa?

01:22:17.932 --> 01:22:20.958
Yeah.
He's trying to head us off.

01:22:21.035 --> 01:22:23.469
Come on!

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:56.393
He's got us, Ben!

01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:58.404
Hold it still!

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.443
Mike.

01:23:51.358 --> 01:23:53.292
Is he dead, Ben?

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:59.359
I wonder how long.

01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:06.466
Go on back to the ranch
and get a buckboard.

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:09.100
You want us to stay
here with you, Ben?

01:24:09.176 --> 01:24:11.644
No, go on back.
Both of you.

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:55.348
Make works unto his will...

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:59.359
and work within you
that which is worthy within his sight...

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:04.057
through Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory forever and ever.

01:25:04.132 --> 01:25:06.066
Amen.

01:25:19.847 --> 01:25:22.475
I'm sorry it had to be this way, Joe.

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:28.747
No!

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:32.088
No more of this.
You are brothers.

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:35.695
Joseph.

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.807
Ma!

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:59.375
- Oh, Ma!
- Joseph. My son.

01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:04.317
You've changed.

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:08.719
Oh, not much. What about you?
These clothes and...

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:12.021
When your father died,
I went back to my people.

01:27:12.093 --> 01:27:15.153
To die too, I think.

01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:17.959
But I knew I must see you.

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:21.092
What do you do
with the gun, Joseph?

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:24.900
It's his.
It's all he had when he started.

01:27:24.972 --> 01:27:26.906
I'm starting too.

01:27:26.974 --> 01:27:30.933
That is not a start. It is the end.
To take that is blood.

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:33.845
They killed him.
Ben did. Slow death.

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:36.383
You saw it happen.
You know what they did.

01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:38.816
You are speaking
like a boy, my son...

01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:41.184
and the years
should have made you a man.

01:27:41.255 --> 01:27:43.883
- But you don't understand.
- Listen to me.

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:49.460
He was my husband
for 25 years.

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:52.693
I loved him more
than anything in the world.

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:55.497
Perhaps even more
than you, Joseph.

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:57.936
I know, Ma.

01:27:58.005 --> 01:28:01.406
You think you take up
his gun and his life.

01:28:01.475 --> 01:28:05.206
You cannot, Joseph.
It is finished with him.

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:08.271
You must make your own life.

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:12.183
Go away.
Take the girl with you.

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:14.278
Barbara?

01:28:14.355 --> 01:28:16.823
She has come to me many times.

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:19.951
For her, too, there can only be one.

01:28:20.027 --> 01:28:23.463
Take her away, Joseph,
and when you are together...

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:26.329
you will know there is
no need for blood...

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.334
not for him...

01:28:30.504 --> 01:28:32.472
not for that.

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:36.566
Give it to me.

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:55.755
What about you, Ma?

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:58.822
There is no longer
need for me, my son.

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:18.180
Keep riding, Joe.

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:20.186
Get goin'.

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:25.558
There's no need for this, Ben.

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:28.561
- I've made up my mind. I'm pulling out.
- Uh-huh.

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:31.393
- You missed your train.
- I don't need any train.

01:29:31.465 --> 01:29:33.933
- I told you I was pulling out, and I am.
- I believe you.

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:35.935
But for how long, Joe?

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:38.062
- What do you mean?
- Just that.

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:41.870
I could never be sure
when you might, uh, get an idea.

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:45.174
Then there's that lance
you threw at my feet the day of the funeral.

01:29:45.246 --> 01:29:48.113
- That was just an old Comanche sign.
- Oh, sure. I know that.

01:29:48.182 --> 01:29:51.413
But, you see,
I'm mighty superstitious, Joe.

01:29:51.485 --> 01:29:54.249
I got to thinking about it,
and, well, I figured...

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:57.689
I might not sleep good nights
worryin' about you.

01:29:57.758 --> 01:30:00.921
And I've been sleepin' awful good
these past few years.

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:03.293
- You're crazy, Ben! You...
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:06.561
Take it easy, Joe.

01:30:06.634 --> 01:30:10.627
Now just swing off there.
We'll get up into the hills.

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:12.639
Move!

01:30:17.411 --> 01:30:20.744
You won't get away with it, Ben.
You're just cutting your own throat.

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:23.841
Maybe. No sense you
worryin' about it though.

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:27.217
What about Denny and Mike?
You can't keep them quiet.

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:29.222
I sent 'em into town.

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:32.282
I know better than to let them in
on anything like this.

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:28.124
I could have saved you the trouble, Joe.

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:38.271
Whoa.

01:34:41.008 --> 01:34:44.603
It's lovely and peaceful here.

01:34:44.678 --> 01:34:48.273
Doesn't seem to go with Pa
somehow, but you can't tell.

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:51.318
Do you think he'd like these?

01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:53.319
I know he would.
