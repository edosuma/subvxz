00:02.370 --> 00:03.537
(Mindy)
It's so great to be back
in New York in the winter,

00:04.605 --> 00:06.674
curling up in a warm bed
next to the one you love.

00:08.676 --> 00:11.112
The only problem is,
I'm pregnant

00:11.212 --> 00:13.314
and morning sick
as hell.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.483
[retches and coughs]

00:15.583 --> 00:17.485
Oops.
Sorry, Bible.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.320
[clears throat]

00:19.420 --> 00:21.189
- You all right?
- Where were we?

00:21.289 --> 00:23.791
Uh...

00:23.891 --> 00:24.792
Okay.

00:25.626 --> 00:26.260
- Just go brush your teeth.
- Okay.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.362
(Mindy)
And for something
called morning sickness,

00:29.163 --> 00:30.398
it sure happens
all the damn time.

00:31.465 --> 00:31.499
(Morgan)
Hey, guys.
I'm testing out a new look.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.667
What do you guys think?

00:33.767 --> 00:35.103
[retches]

00:35.203 --> 00:37.238
Lady at the hat store
said the same thing.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.472
(Mindy)
On the positive side,

00:38.572 --> 00:40.308
morning sickness teaches you
how to make

00:40.408 --> 00:42.343
all of New York
your personal barf bag.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.344
Babe.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.146
[retches]

00:45.246 --> 00:46.680
(Mindy)
Fortunately,
my constant ralphing

00:46.780 --> 00:49.083
is only bringing Danny and me
closer together.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.818
Hey, you looking
at my Little League trophy?

00:50.918 --> 00:52.153
Uh-huh.

00:53.121 --> 00:53.154
You know, I was
the best player on the team,

00:53.821 --> 00:54.755
and we had
some Dominicans.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.290
Cool.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.292
- Did you barf in it?
- Yeah.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.128
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, Danny.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.062
It's only a second-place trophy,
though, right?

01:02.163 --> 01:03.431
I hate to see you
like this.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.400
You know, Castellano babies
always cause morning sickness.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.068
We have a saying
in my family:

01:08.169 --> 01:09.603
First they
make you puke;

01:09.703 --> 01:11.071
then they wreak havoc
on your birth canal.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.072
[knock at door]

01:12.173 --> 01:13.407
- Hi.
- Hey, buddy.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.509
Dr. L, everyone knows
about your condition.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.444
[imitates gagging]

01:16.544 --> 01:17.645
All right, Morgan,
let's wrap this up.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.580
Ta-da.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.250
Is that
a bedazzled barf bucket?

01:22.350 --> 01:23.684
Wow, Morgan!

01:23.784 --> 01:25.619
It's so beautiful.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.421
This is the nicest gift
anyone's given me

01:27.521 --> 01:28.756
since Danny took me
to Bruno Mars.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.158
(Morgan)
Oh, Bruno Mars and I--

01:30.258 --> 01:31.859
Hat brothers.
Oh, God.

01:31.959 --> 01:32.860
Stop talking
about that stupid hat!

01:32.960 --> 01:33.861
All right.

01:33.961 --> 01:36.864
[hip-hop music]

01:36.964 --> 01:45.105
*

01:48.942 --> 01:51.579
(Danny)
Morning, sweetheart.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.314
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing here?

01:53.414 --> 01:55.183
- Get away from the microwave.
- What?

01:55.283 --> 01:56.550
I don't want you using
the microwave that much

01:56.650 --> 01:58.619
when you're pregnant--
the rays and the waves.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.454
Didn't you read the parenting
book that I gave you?

02:00.554 --> 02:02.490
- Panic Womb?
- Relax.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.192
I'm not using
the microwave.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.359
I'm just getting
some coffee.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.694
Don't--don't--
don't sip the coffee!

02:06.794 --> 02:09.129
- What's wrong with you?
- That's even worse.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.698
Right here,
A Brave New Dad says

02:10.798 --> 02:12.566
that coffee can stunt
a baby's growth.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.436
I'll read it to you.
Chapter 14.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.637
Don't do that.
It's boring.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.138
I mean, you should
read these too.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.273
Look, I don't
have time to read

02:19.373 --> 02:20.574
all your boring
parenting books.

02:21.675 --> 02:21.709
You don't have any time
because you're always reading

02:22.210 --> 02:22.843
the baby name books.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.144
Oh, by the way,

02:25.078 --> 02:26.547
what do you think
of the name Femonique?

02:26.647 --> 02:27.781
Warmer, but no.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.818
Look, Min, I need you ready
for when this baby comes, okay?

02:30.918 --> 02:33.287
I made you
a delicious breakfast.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.523
- Close your eyes.
- Ooh, now we're talking.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.291
Okay.
Open 'em up.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.692
- Oh, God.
- What?

02:38.792 --> 02:40.594
- What the hell is that?
- It's oatmeal.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.296
I'm expected
to eat this?

02:42.396 --> 02:43.397
It's steel-cut.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.399
It is 9:00 a.m.
on a Sunday.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.634
- Mm-hmm.
- I need eggs.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.169
I need waffles.
I need four kinds of pig's meat.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.438
I don't need
no bowl of oatmeals.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.172
With your morning sickness,
no way.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.707
You got to eat healthy.
Start now.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.776
I have been eating for two
my entire life,

02:55.876 --> 02:57.245
and now I actually
have an excuse.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.846
I'm not gonna waste it
on steel-cut oats.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.281
- Okay.
- Look.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.582
Pregnancy is hard enough
as it is.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.683
You're right.

03:03.617 --> 03:03.917
I am also starting
my own fertility clinic.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.386
Yes, you are.

03:06.520 --> 03:06.554
I had to completely
put my modeling career on hold.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.789
- What?
- I need these simple pleasures.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.758
By the way,
you should talk.

03:10.858 --> 03:11.825
Don't think
I don't know

03:12.760 --> 03:13.227
about your little
cigarette smoking habit.

03:13.961 --> 03:14.262
No, when I heard
about the baby,

03:14.895 --> 03:15.629
I quit smoking
cold turkey.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.566
That reminds me.
Cold turkey.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.670
- For protein.
- I'm gonna kill you.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.873
(Jeremy)
Good morning.

03:26.940 --> 03:27.941
As you're no doubt aware,
the practice is once again

03:28.041 --> 03:29.343
facing a moment
of crisis.

03:29.443 --> 03:30.611
I know!

03:31.745 --> 03:32.313
The homeless guy sleeping
in our courtyard is back.

03:33.113 --> 03:33.681
I keep finding
his trash out there.

03:34.181 --> 03:34.748
I'm buying a BB gun.

03:35.616 --> 03:36.917
You can use my gun.
It's in the fridge.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.787
With Peter having left
and Mindy branching out

03:39.887 --> 03:41.622
to start
her own fertility practice,

03:41.722 --> 03:43.291
we're busier than ever,
which is great,

03:43.391 --> 03:45.659
but we do need to hire
a new doctor immediately.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.760
You know what we need?

03:47.728 --> 03:48.996
Someone modern and cool
who could relate to me

03:50.063 --> 03:50.831
and everyone else
in Generation Hunger Games.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.701
I'm sorry.
Did you say modern and cool?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.369
Psst.
Hello, Dr. C.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.637
No, don't look.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.838
Okay, we're looking
to hire a doctor,

03:57.938 --> 03:59.573
not an aspiring
R&B singer.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.442
Sir, I just want
one doughnut

04:01.542 --> 04:02.443
on each of my fingers.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.444
It's not
that hard to--

04:03.544 --> 04:04.645
I'll just
do it myself.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.814
Mindy.
Mindy Lahiri.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.015
Dr. Phillips?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.718
Wow, I haven't seen you
since med school graduation.

04:10.818 --> 04:11.852
You were always
my favorite professor.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.555
Oh, that's nice.
You look great.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.589
Thank you.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.990
Your acne
really cleared up.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.859
It actually
migrated to my butt,

04:18.959 --> 04:19.860
but thank you.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.262
Oh, I actually saw
the inside of your apartment

04:22.363 --> 04:23.697
in Architectural Digest.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.733
They always have it
in my psychic's waiting room.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.000
And there it was.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.736
Yes, yes,
since I've retired,

04:28.836 --> 04:30.671
I have plenty of time
to decorate.

04:30.704 --> 04:30.738
But can I confess
something?

04:32.540 --> 04:34.342
I had the hots
for you too.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.510
Yes, I got
all your letters.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.379
Since I've retired,
I'm a little bored.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.580
Wait.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.449
I may be getting
kind of a good idea.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.617
Our practice is looking
for a new doctor,

04:43.717 --> 04:45.453
and if you're bored,
I might be the answer.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.020
Interesting.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.789
Ron's busy
with his hedge fund,

04:48.889 --> 04:51.725
and the twins still
aren't talking to me.

04:51.825 --> 04:52.960
Well, this is perfect.
I'm gonna call you in.

04:53.060 --> 04:53.961
You're gonna meet
the other guys.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.596
- Great.
- So good to run into you.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.964
Good to see you.

04:57.064 --> 04:57.965
Bye, Dr. Phillips.

04:58.065 --> 04:58.966
I love you!

04:59.066 --> 05:00.468
Buh-bye.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.937
Beverly, Beverly.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.606
I found our girl,
so you can tell

05:05.706 --> 05:07.608
Dr. Reed's parade of Melvins
that they're dismissed.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.611
The Melvins have already camped
out in the conference room.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.413
- Oh, God.
- It's very inconvenient.

05:12.446 --> 05:12.480
That's where I lock myself
when I need to be racist.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.817
- I don't think you should--
- Hey, what's the hold-up here?

05:16.917 --> 05:17.985
I came all the way
from the suburbs

05:18.085 --> 05:19.420
to meet for this job.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.321
Sorry, sir, but the suburbs
aren't that far.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.856
The suburbs
of Philadelphia.

05:22.956 --> 05:23.991
I need to be
back there at 5:00

05:24.091 --> 05:26.560
for my daughter's
cheer competition.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.928
Brenda says
I have to bring juice.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.797
I'm gonna handle this one
for you, boss.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.064
You're really annoying
the lady,

05:31.164 --> 05:32.466
and you got to leave.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.101
Look, I came all this way.
I'm interviewing.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.370
So take this, and go get me
a cup of coffee.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.605
The button
hurt my cheek.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.707
You didn't really
take care of that, did you?

05:39.807 --> 05:40.741
Sir, I'm sorry.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.075
The position
has been filled

05:42.175 --> 05:43.777
by someone
who would fit in better

05:43.877 --> 05:46.614
with our kind of trendy,
cosmopolitan office atmosphere.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.349
Someone, like, from the mind
of Shonda Rhimes.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.618
Who's Shonda Rhimes?

05:50.718 --> 05:51.619
- [laughs]
- Wow.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.686
Oh, my God.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.522
Who's Shonda Rhimes?

05:54.622 --> 05:56.023
Scandal,
Grey's Anatomy,

05:57.324 --> 05:58.459
- How to Get Away with Murder.
- Private Practice.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.127
- Crossroads the movie.
- [clicks tongue]

06:00.794 --> 06:01.595
You know what?
Your loss.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.997
I'm board-certified,
highly recommended.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.666
I got a nice,
loud voice.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.367
All right,
everybody, let's go.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.969
Job's been filled.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.938
Anybody who wants
a ride to Philly,

06:11.038 --> 06:12.773
we're splitting gas
fif-fif.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.608
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, keep on walking.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.743
Move it, shorty.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.377
Wait, wait,
where are my doctors going?

06:17.778 --> 06:18.612
Chill, Jeremy.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.014
I sent them all home because
I found the perfect doctor--

06:21.114 --> 06:23.016
Suzanne Phillips,
bitches.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.419
Suzanne Phillips?
Well, she's amazing.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.720
But isn't she rich
and retired?

06:26.820 --> 06:27.921
She might have
been retired,

06:28.021 --> 06:31.391
but guess who got to her--
me, Mindy Lahiri.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.461
I got charm
and elegance,

06:33.561 --> 06:34.695
like a polished debutante.

06:34.795 --> 06:35.763
[chuckles]

06:35.863 --> 06:36.864
You forgot
your barf bucket.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.099
Oh, God.
Yeah, I'm gonna need this.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.100
I can feel it coming up.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.102
(Morgan)
Go, go, go, go, go.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.744
- Hey.
- Nothing, nothing, ah!

06:50.844 --> 06:52.513
Knock much?
I could've been watching porn.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.181
Did you forget
about our check-up with Pete?

06:54.281 --> 06:56.684
I was just eating my banana,
my favorite food.

06:56.784 --> 06:57.685
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.588
Let's go.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.623
Hey, how are
my favorite MILF and DILF?

07:02.723 --> 07:04.157
- What's up, Pete?
- Hey, Peter.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.659
- How's Texas?
- It's good.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.160
I think you'd
really like it here, Mindy.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.862
- Everyone spits.
- Cool.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.130
Pete, how's it going
with Lauren?

07:10.230 --> 07:12.766
- Things going good?
- We went on a date.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.167
It wasn't really
a date, actually.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.169
Full disclosure--
I rear-ended her with my car

07:16.269 --> 07:18.005
when I was following
behind her too closely,

07:18.105 --> 07:20.741
but now we are having lunch
one time, TBD.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.743
- Oh, Peter.
- But enough about me.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.878
Let's talk pregnancy.
Mindy, how are you feeling?

07:24.978 --> 07:26.079
I'm okay.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.081
I wish I still had my period
to blame my behavior on,

07:29.216 --> 07:30.518
and Mussolini over here
is trying to make me eat better.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.086
Italy's most organized leader--
yeah, I'll take that, Pete.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.623
You know, Mindy,
I'm looking over your chart,

07:35.723 --> 07:38.759
and due to your age
and weight,

07:38.859 --> 07:41.228
you fall
into a special category

07:41.328 --> 07:42.763
of pregnancy.

07:42.863 --> 07:43.997
What kind
of special category?

07:44.097 --> 07:45.766
Like, hot ethnic
power moms?

07:45.866 --> 07:46.967
(Peter)
Sort of.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.770
Technically, you qualify
as a geriatric obese pregnancy.

07:49.870 --> 07:50.871
How dare you?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.072
(Danny)
Stop, stop, no. Don't.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.607
- Mindy...
- Go to hell, Peter!

07:53.707 --> 07:55.042
As your doctor,
I'm officially putting

07:55.142 --> 07:56.810
Danny in charge
of your diet.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.546
Okay.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.814
Lahiri,
hand over the candy.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.820
Look at this.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.623
- Happy?
- All the candy.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.631
You got to be
kidding me.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.866
[sighs]

08:23.336 --> 08:24.738
You already get on
with this one,

08:25.839 --> 08:26.674
which historically has been
one of the biggest hurdles

08:26.774 --> 08:27.775
to working here.

08:27.875 --> 08:28.909
That's enough.
I'm a dream.

08:29.009 --> 08:29.910
But I do have
to ask,

08:30.811 --> 08:32.045
are you really looking
for this much work,

08:32.145 --> 08:33.513
you know, at this stage
of your career?

08:33.614 --> 08:35.215
How much work
is involved?

08:35.315 --> 08:36.650
It's not too bad.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.785
I mean, last week,

08:38.819 --> 08:40.020
I only slept on the floor
of my office four times.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.790
I take Sunday mornings off
for church.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.124
Guys, you're not
selling us well.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.894
Dr. Phillips,
this is the sexiest

08:46.994 --> 08:49.897
and coolest office
in all of Manhattan, okay?

08:49.997 --> 08:50.698
I'm doing this guy.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.766
Plus, I'm always
touching everyone.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.034
Okay, okay, stop it.

08:55.168 --> 08:55.202
- If you see anything you like--
- What are you doing?

08:55.836 --> 08:56.536
(Danny)
This job's for you

08:57.537 --> 08:59.206
if you show up, say good-bye
to your social life,

08:59.306 --> 09:00.774
and work to the bone.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.943
I-I see you're all
very busy,

09:03.043 --> 09:06.780
and obviously, I need
to discuss this with my husband.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.781
(Danny)
Of course.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.249
But it's been
a pleasure.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.718
Milady,
I'll escort you out.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.219
I have your gift bag.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.253
That's my purse.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.188
I put a coffee mug
in there.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.190
And may I say, you are
the most beautiful woman

09:17.290 --> 09:18.692
I've ever seen
in my life.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.228
Okay, Morgan, stop.
Stop, that's not appropriate.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.796
- Inappropriate.
- Thank you.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.634
Oh, let me get
the door for you.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.068
Thank you.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.069
[grunts]
Didn't trip.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.104
- I was stretching.
- Yes!

09:31.204 --> 09:33.607
(Danny)
Okay, there you go.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.976
Why is this steak white?
What's with this green crud?

09:36.076 --> 09:38.145
- Where's my dessert?
- Oh, yeah, I forgot, sorry.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.813
I printed out

09:39.913 --> 09:41.915
these really funny
Yogi Berra quotes.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.984
If you're still hungry,
just read those.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.318
That will definitely
take your mind off things.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.120
Hey, guys.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.256
We're gonna party
like it's my birthday,

09:49.356 --> 09:50.691
'cause it is.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.926
Oh, my God,
it's my favorite kind of cake--

09:53.026 --> 09:53.927
gigantic.

09:54.728 --> 09:55.863
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sit down.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.597
Willpower.
Willpower.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.933
If you can give up smoking,
then I can do this.

10:00.033 --> 10:00.934
Yeah.

10:01.835 --> 10:02.803
I can eat this white steak
you brought me.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.371
Chicken.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.106
Delicious.
Mmm, nom, nom.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.374
I am so proud of you.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.042
May this lunch
be the beginning

10:09.142 --> 10:11.144
of a lifetime
of healthy eating.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.947
A lifetime?
What do you mean a lifetime?

10:14.047 --> 10:15.282
Mangia.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.651
[phone vibrates]

10:17.751 --> 10:20.353
[phone plays tune]

10:20.453 --> 10:22.255
[phone vibrates, plays tune]

10:23.924 --> 10:25.192
Ooh.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.999
[phone vibrates, plays tune]

10:32.099 --> 10:34.868
No.
No, no, no.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.970
Mindy, have you heard
from Dr. Phillips yet?

10:37.070 --> 10:39.639
I'm nervous.
We don't have a backup.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.274
What are you eating?
Is this a joke?

10:41.374 --> 10:42.642
There's
a birthday cake here.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.679
Uh, uh...

10:45.779 --> 10:47.080
Yeah, yeah.
You know what, screw this.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.048
We'll have some cake.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.783
- Happy birthday.
- * Happy birth--

10:50.984 --> 10:52.753
Oh, my God, Dr. L, I was gonna
take a selfie with the cake.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.054
This is a great cake.

10:54.154 --> 10:54.888
- We were about to sing.
- Mindy?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.389
(Danny)
I found this half a banana

10:56.489 --> 10:58.926
in my gym bag.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.661
- Hey, sweetheart.
- I just left for two seconds.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.030
They were forcing me to.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.832
(Tamra)
You are a damn liar.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.800
I got a baby in there,
and he's cooking,

11:06.900 --> 11:08.435
and he needs
some healthy chicken.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.670
You know what?
You have no willpower, Mindy.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.006
No willpower.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.209
You ruined
my birthday.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.811
I need to take
the rest of the week off.

11:17.911 --> 11:18.979
Oh, Tamra.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.020
[raccoon chatters]

11:27.120 --> 11:28.388
Hey, Pepe.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.724
Oh, yeah.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.794
My snacks are pretty gross,
but Danny's right.

11:33.894 --> 11:37.430
I have to eat healthier
for the health of my own litter.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.067
[Pepe chatters]

11:40.167 --> 11:42.069
Want to try some?
Maybe you'll like it.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.036
I've seen you
eat out of the garbage,

11:43.136 --> 11:44.938
and you've seen me
eat out of the garbage.

11:45.038 --> 11:45.939
[chatters]

11:46.039 --> 11:47.841
It's green beans
or something.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.076
Pepe.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.745
Just try it, Pepe.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.881
It's not that bad.

11:53.981 --> 11:56.249
[sighs]

11:56.349 --> 11:58.385
Oh, my God, Tamra!
I found the bum!

11:58.485 --> 12:00.453
Hey, you!
Get a job!

12:00.553 --> 12:01.855
Danny?

12:01.955 --> 12:03.356
Danny, are you smoking?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.325
(Mindy)
You're chain smoking?

12:09.162 --> 12:10.998
Smoking is literally
the stupidest

12:11.098 --> 12:12.933
and most harmful thing
you can do,

12:13.033 --> 12:14.301
and this is coming
from a woman

12:15.535 --> 12:16.403
who considered eating cheese
from a mouse trap this morning.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.071
Yeah, not to mention
the rubbish

12:18.906 --> 12:19.372
that Doris is gonna have
to clean up

12:20.307 --> 12:21.474
and all the lies
we now have to live with.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.777
The lies, Danny.
Doris, Danny.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.946
I'm sorry.
It calms me down.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.148
I tried painting, but I kept
painting my own tombstone,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.083
and my teacher said
I was bumming everyone out.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.919
All this time,
you were giving me crap

12:32.019 --> 12:34.154
about my prenatal diet
when you were doing this?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.188
This!

12:36.056 --> 12:37.124
Oh, I think that
makes you a hypocrite

12:37.224 --> 12:38.758
or hypocryte.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.127
I've only ever seen
the word written.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.261
Hypocrite.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.963
Let's not fight.
It's a beautiful night.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.965
The moon's out.
You look gorgeous, babe.

12:45.065 --> 12:45.966
[groans]
Okay.

12:46.066 --> 12:46.967
Get over here.
Give me a k--

12:47.067 --> 12:48.368
[pop]
- Ow!

12:48.468 --> 12:49.970
Tamra,
you just shot me!

12:50.070 --> 12:51.104
I thought
you were the bum.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.340
There's no way you could've
thought I was the bum!

12:53.440 --> 12:55.275
You don't dress that great.
You could've been the bum.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.344
For the last time,
we don't shoot anybody.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.478
You deserve
getting shot.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.780
- Ow!
- Shoot him again, Tamra.

13:00.881 --> 13:01.882
- No! No.
- Don't. Don't.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.017
- Do it, Tamra.
- No!

13:04.117 --> 13:06.053
(Danny)
Listen up, everyone.
I have an announcement to make.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.121
I'm sorry
I let you down, okay?

13:08.221 --> 13:09.823
I'm gonna quit smoking
once and for all.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.124
That's it.
It's over.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.861
We must be the change
we wish to see in this world.

13:13.961 --> 13:14.862
Gandhi said that.

13:15.662 --> 13:16.196
First of all,
John Mayer said that.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.098
Gandhi said,
"The British are coming,"

13:19.066 --> 13:20.067
and that's how he got
independence for India.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.035
Okay, I don't doubt
you think that's true.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.237
Speaking of extraordinary
Indian people,

13:25.205 --> 13:26.306
Mindy, I believe
if you put your mind to it,

13:26.406 --> 13:27.908
you can have
a fit pregnancy.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.109
- Oh, do you?
- Yes, I do.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.510
Well, I will start
eating better

13:30.610 --> 13:31.511
when you quit smoking.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.046
Great, well,
you can start right now.

13:34.181 --> 13:34.882
It's 8:30 in the morning.
Stop eating cheese puffs.

13:35.916 --> 13:36.984
Guess what, dude, you're
nothing but a drug addict.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.186
Okay, come on,
I'm not a drug addict.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.488
All I know is, somebody needs
to reimburse me for my BB gun.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.023
Danny, as an act
of contrition,

13:43.123 --> 13:44.357
you can pick up
the rest of Peter's deliveries

13:44.457 --> 13:45.926
for the rest
of the month.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.094
Mindy, you got
to concentrate

13:47.194 --> 13:49.229
on finding a replacement
for the disaster

13:49.329 --> 13:51.331
that was Dr. Phillips,
and before you say it,

13:51.431 --> 13:52.832
Dr. Dre
is not a real doctor.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.269
Okay, he has an MD in hip-hop.
That is neither here nor there.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.038
Fine, I will do it,
because on some level,

13:58.138 --> 13:59.272
the staffing issue
is my fault.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.974
On every level,
it's your fault.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.976
I am sorry that
I have some standards

14:03.076 --> 14:04.377
for the people
that I want to work with.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.046
Standards?
We're replacing Peter.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.448
The guy talked like Chewbacca
30% of the time.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.517
[as Yoda]
Pretty good my Yoda is.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.319
Not as good
as Jeremy's C-3PO.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.186
Check this out.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.621
I'm not doing
a C-3P0 impression.

14:14.721 --> 14:15.956
This is how
I talk.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.290
(Danny)
That's pretty good, right?

14:17.390 --> 14:19.126
Danny, stop smoking.
Mindy, start staffing.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.593
Everyone else,
get back to work.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.196
All right.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.932
(Britney Spears)
* You want a hot body?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.433
* Sipping martinis

14:26.533 --> 14:28.501
* Look, you better work, bitch

14:28.601 --> 14:30.503
* You want to live fancy?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.405
* Live in a big mansion?

14:32.505 --> 14:34.307
* Party in France?

14:34.407 --> 14:36.109
* You better work, bitch

14:36.209 --> 14:37.978
* You better work,
bitch *

14:38.078 --> 14:39.112
* Now get to work, bitch

14:43.750 --> 14:46.653
* Now get to work, bitch

14:46.753 --> 14:53.126
*

14:54.427 --> 14:55.628
Hello--

14:55.728 --> 14:58.665
Read 'em and weep,
Lahiri.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.201
Classic mailboxes
of Suffolk County,

15:01.301 --> 15:02.402
a wall calendar.

15:03.403 --> 15:03.436
No, I haven't had
a cigarette in two weeks,

15:04.237 --> 15:05.072
which means I quit,
sweetheart,

15:05.973 --> 15:08.641
so you can say good-bye
to this garbage.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.943
You quit smoking?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.644
- Yup.
- How?

15:11.744 --> 15:14.081
Are you using the patch?
That's cheating, Danny.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.515
No, nicotine patches
are for the weak.

15:15.615 --> 15:19.252
I quit the old-fashioned way:
self-discipline, prayer,

15:19.352 --> 15:21.454
and putting a picture
of the Boston Red Sox logo

15:21.554 --> 15:23.390
on the pack of my smokes.
[clicks tongue]

15:23.490 --> 15:25.959
When I am stressed,
I need to eat trans fats

15:26.059 --> 15:27.094
and corn syrups,

15:27.194 --> 15:29.062
but it's fine,
'cause in this country,

15:29.162 --> 15:31.198
we celebrate
the extremely overweight

15:31.298 --> 15:32.499
and the terrifyingly slim.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.034
This in-between thing
I was doing,

15:34.134 --> 15:35.035
that was the problem.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.136
I need to just
go for it.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.237
I need to get huge.

15:38.171 --> 15:38.671
You know why you have
morning sickness?

15:39.239 --> 15:40.007
Because you eat terribly

15:40.907 --> 15:41.975
and you refuse to modify
your lifestyle,

15:42.942 --> 15:44.044
even though you're pregnant
with our baby.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.113
It's our baby, Mindy.
Come on.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.647
I do not want to be
the only parent

15:47.747 --> 15:48.648
in this relationship.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.151
I don't want that.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.686
Congratulations
on giving up smoking.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.189
That's a really hard thing
to do, and I'm proud of you.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.025
Well, thank you
very much.

15:58.125 --> 16:02.329
I wish I could fix myself
as easily as you can,

16:02.429 --> 16:03.997
but I can't.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.533
Now I'm pregnant.
I sweat constantly.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.135
I need to carry
a barf pail around.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.003
My nipples are, like,
nine shades darker

16:10.103 --> 16:11.238
than they used to be.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.040
- Look, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

16:13.140 --> 16:17.210
It's not okay.
I am an OB/GYN.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.179
I'm supposed to be telling
my patients what to do,

16:19.279 --> 16:21.248
and the truth is that...

16:21.348 --> 16:22.649
[gulps]

16:22.749 --> 16:24.551
I have no idea--

16:24.651 --> 16:26.619
Babe.
You okay?

16:26.719 --> 16:28.321
Babe.
Mindy.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.390
Oh, here's where
I left my jacket.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.524
And I've been
walking around

16:31.624 --> 16:32.525
in my daughter's
cheerleading windbreaker

16:32.625 --> 16:33.693
for the last two weeks.

16:33.793 --> 16:34.761
No, you know what?

16:34.861 --> 16:36.129
A decent person
would've called

16:36.229 --> 16:37.497
about a mysterious
man's coat,

16:37.597 --> 16:39.099
but I guess you,
Dr. Lahiri,

16:39.199 --> 16:40.667
are just
a little too inconsiderate

16:40.767 --> 16:43.403
to think about any--

16:49.476 --> 16:50.410
I puked
all over you.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.312
No.
No, it's fine.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.413
Get it all out.
You're gonna be all right.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.182
- I'm usually so elegant.
- You're gonna be fine.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.283
Here, have a seat.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.484
(Danny)
Okay, here you go, champ.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.354
(Danny)
Let me save you some time.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.156
It's garden variety
morning sickness

17:03.256 --> 17:05.158
exacerbated
by poor food choices.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.426
I disagree.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.794
Judging by the contents
of her stomach,

17:07.894 --> 17:09.596
which appear to be
sour candy worms,

17:09.696 --> 17:12.165
mac and cheese,
and what looks like

17:12.265 --> 17:15.668
the acetate strip that holds
a cheesecake in place,

17:15.768 --> 17:18.338
I'd say Dr. Lahiri
has a steel stomach.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.439
(Morgan)
Oh, my God!

17:19.539 --> 17:21.274
My angel.
This should be me.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.443
This should be my windbreaker
that's covered in puke.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.078
Easy, she's gonna be fine.
Listen--

17:25.178 --> 17:26.079
I'm gonna be sick again.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.180
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.481
It is
my medical opinion

17:29.716 --> 17:31.118
that Dr. Lahiri does not have
diet-triggered morning sickness.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.052
She has stress-triggered
morning sickness.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.422
Oh, well, that's
a really cool diagnosis.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.590
I think we know how to treat
Dr. L's morning sickness.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.759
Excuse me, please.
Unbelievable.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.628
All right.
Hey there, old girl.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.762
It's time
for a steam.

17:43.696 --> 17:44.464
I'm gonna put you
in the hot pipe room.

17:45.765 --> 17:46.366
I'm gonna wrap you in blankets,
and I'm gonna turn the heat--

17:47.467 --> 17:48.401
No, the last thing
a nauseous pregnant woman needs

17:49.369 --> 17:51.771
is to sit still
in a hot, windowless room.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.141
Excuse me.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.808
Look here, cowboy.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.212
We do it my way,
or we don't do it at all.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.281
I think we should do
what Dr. Bergdahl said.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.683
You sure about that?
I made a bunch of goulash.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.285
No, I don't--
I'm not interested.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.587
Let's get you
out of these clothes.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.089
Wait, Dr. Bergdahl.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.224
Thank you.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.592
Yeah.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.428
(Danny)
Unfortunately, I think
your windbreaker's finished.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.763
So what do you think
is stressing out

18:16.863 --> 18:18.265
Dr. Lahiri so much?

18:18.365 --> 18:20.133
She doesn't pay
her taxes.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.734
I think she had a hit-and-run
thing in the Hamptons.

18:21.834 --> 18:22.869
I don't know.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.304
It was misleading of me
to ask that

18:24.404 --> 18:25.705
in the form
of a question.

18:26.939 --> 18:27.474
What I meant to say is, I think
you're stressing her out.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.377
Me?
Okay, that's ridiculous.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.479
I'm her rock.
Literally.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.414
She sits on me
to think sometimes.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.682
Oh.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.418
Looks like you're trying
to kick something too.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.587
What's your drug
of choice, huh?

18:40.687 --> 18:44.357
Is it smack,
booze, anorexia?

18:44.457 --> 18:45.358
Oh, come on.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.126
I'm super excited
for March.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.328
It's gonna be
a great month.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.296
Whatever, man.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.164
All I'm saying is,
when that baby comes,

18:51.264 --> 18:52.565
all bets are off.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.367
You haven't slept
in three days.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.902
You got this creature
screaming at you,

18:56.002 --> 18:57.304
won't tell you
what it wants.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.139
Maybe you ate
a little baby poop by accident.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.341
You're gonna backslide.

19:01.441 --> 19:04.211
You're gonna go back
to that vice,

19:04.311 --> 19:05.578
and you are definitely
gonna want her

19:05.678 --> 19:06.779
to cut you some slack.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.316
[door opens]

19:12.319 --> 19:14.654
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait, Adrian.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.189
What if I asked you
to work here?

19:16.289 --> 19:17.890
Danny, can't you see
I'm having my supper?

19:17.990 --> 19:20.159
You got to run
this stuff by me.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.561
Yeah, well,
I just trust the guy--

19:21.661 --> 19:22.895
I don't know--
and so does Mindy.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.564
But he looks like
the guy who can't sleep

19:24.664 --> 19:26.165
in a cold medicine
commercial.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.166
[sighs]

19:28.000 --> 19:28.768
Well, I suppose
we are out of options.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.504
Dr. Bergdahl, would you
like to join the practice

19:31.604 --> 19:32.772
on a trial basis?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.542
Yeah, I'm out of options too,
so you got a deal.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.877
Hi.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.712
So I just walked
Dr. Lahiri home,

19:39.812 --> 19:41.414
and this fedora,

19:41.514 --> 19:43.850
which some of you called
the crime of the century,

19:43.950 --> 19:45.485
caught most of her barf,

19:45.585 --> 19:48.488
so I'll be in my office
accepting all apologies.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.789
No.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.225
Morgan, I'd like you
to meet our new doctor,

19:52.325 --> 19:53.826
Dr. Bergdahl.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.901
[screams and gags]

20:02.001 --> 20:04.837
(Mindy)
Yeah, you're pretty insightful
for a giraffe.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.207
Mr. Neck's
a good listener, right?

20:08.308 --> 20:10.443
What?
No.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.978
I wasn't just talking
to your stuffed animal.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.746
- That's ridiculous.
- Okay.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.982
Besides, he claims
to know Brown Bear,

20:16.082 --> 20:18.451
which, like, how would
they have met?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.520
You know why I think you have
so much trouble with willpower?

20:20.620 --> 20:21.821
I don't know,
because I'm Hindu,

20:21.921 --> 20:23.456
and on some level,

20:23.556 --> 20:25.325
I feel like I'll have
another shot at all this?

20:25.425 --> 20:28.395
No, no, because
it's really, really hard.

20:28.428 --> 20:28.461
The only reason
I'm good at it

20:29.729 --> 20:32.599
is because
my entire religious education

20:32.699 --> 20:34.901
is based
on one man's self-sacrifice.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.404
I mean, why do you think
I wear this?

20:37.504 --> 20:38.705
So people don't think
you're Jewish?

20:38.805 --> 20:41.841
No, please be quiet.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.743
I think
I'm hard on you sometimes

20:43.843 --> 20:48.448
because I'm worried
when the little guy comes

20:48.548 --> 20:51.418
that I'm not gonna know
what the hell I'm doing,

20:51.518 --> 20:53.720
and I need you, Mindy.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.622
I need you to be around.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.358
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.327
Danny, I only get upset
with you about your smoking

21:00.427 --> 21:02.028
because I need you around.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.531
I can't do this
by myself.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.533
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.035
I was so scared when I found out
that I was pregnant,

21:09.135 --> 21:10.837
but I thought
the kid will be fine

21:10.937 --> 21:12.972
'cause you're the dad.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.579
Really?

21:19.679 --> 21:20.747
Come here.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.386
One sec.
One second.

21:26.486 --> 21:27.387
Get it all out.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.988
[retches]

21:29.088 --> 21:30.990
(Mindy)
I'm good. Take your pants off.
