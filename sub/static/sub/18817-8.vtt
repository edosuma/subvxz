WEBVTT

00:06.881 --> 00:08.841
Oh, someone looks nice.

00:08.925 --> 00:11.136
Oh,  gracias.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.806
I learned to do the contouring
on the YouTube.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.144
Oh! She looks nice, too.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.979
Interesting.

00:23.481 --> 00:26.025
Very... [imitating Lydia] interesting.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.487
Should I be interested? Because I'm not.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.199
What are you guys talking about?

00:32.282 --> 00:35.243
Lupita, it is Friday at 7:00 p.m.

00:35.327 --> 00:38.496
Usually by now, your sweatpants are on
and your bra is off.

00:39.831 --> 00:40.998
You have a date.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.251
[gasps] It's a date!

00:43.335 --> 00:44.461
[chuckles] What?

00:44.544 --> 00:47.714
Can't I just shower, put on lipstick
and nice clothes just for myself?

00:47.797 --> 00:49.424
Yeah, I'm not even buying it.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.094
Yes, why not be honest?

00:52.177 --> 00:53.595
Mira,  for  ejemplo,

00:53.678 --> 00:56.639
I am going to church tonight
to feed the poor.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.391
There, I said it.

00:59.809 --> 01:00.810
Okay, fine.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.520
It's a date.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.647
Just a casual drink, not a big deal.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.608
I met him through a friend.
He will never replace your  papi.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.110
No, he's not Cuban.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.154
Your date no longer interests me.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.574
[inhales sharply] Anyway, I gotta go soon,

01:14.657 --> 01:16.243
but I forgot  Abuelita  and I
are both doing something.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.786
-Alex, what're you doing tonight?
-Chilling at Finn's house.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.580
Didn't you just say this morning

01:20.663 --> 01:22.999
that you had so much homework
to do this weekend?

01:23.083 --> 01:26.503
Finn has this genius idea
to fill up a shopping cart with candy

01:26.586 --> 01:29.047
and ask girls
if they wanna hop in our sweet ride.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.550
Okay, so you're gonna stay home.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.469
And Elena will watch you.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.553
-Oh.
-[Alex sighs]

01:35.637 --> 01:37.472
So you automatically assume
I don't have any plans?

01:37.555 --> 01:39.599
-You have plans?
-I could.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.726
Ay, qué bueno.

01:41.809 --> 01:46.189
Finally, you are going to pick a boy
to be your  quinces  escort.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.526
Abuelita,  I already asked someone
and I should know by the end of the day.

01:49.609 --> 01:50.693
-[gasps]
-He's in my English class.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.946
We're just friends.
And no, he's not Cuban.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.116
Why do you two love to hurt me?

01:57.742 --> 02:00.662
-Anyway, have a good date, Mom.
-[whispers] Bye.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.164
And don't try to hide stuff from us.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.291
What can I say? I'm a terrible liar.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.000
I am an amazing liar.

02:07.084 --> 02:09.129
And you'd rather let them think
all that date stuff,

02:09.212 --> 02:11.088
instead of just telling them
you're goin' to therapy?

02:11.173 --> 02:12.924
Oh, yeah!

02:13.925 --> 02:17.220
If they had guessed I was a serial killer,
I would have gone with that, too.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.055
[theme song playing]

03:08.104 --> 03:11.107
I am so sorry I'm late, you guys.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.445
I was at the movies.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.779
Another remake.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.115
[scoffs] Well, I mean,
it was nothing like the original.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.450
But I like 'em both.

03:22.159 --> 03:25.830
Anyway, Lolly brought up
a really great point last week.

03:25.913 --> 03:29.834
There's a lot of anxiety and depression
that we face as veterans

03:29.917 --> 03:32.254
that can lead to isolation, right?

03:32.337 --> 03:35.673
Because our civilian friends
and family members, they can't relate.

03:35.757 --> 03:36.883
[Ramona] Oh, for sure.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.469
I mean, I'm a gay female minority,

03:39.552 --> 03:42.054
so anxiety and depression
are my two best friends.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.474
-[all chuckling]
-And isolation is my boo.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.100
[all laughing]

03:46.183 --> 03:48.936
And there's definitely some combat stuff
that's tough to shake.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.814
In Iraq, if your Hummer
gets stuck in traffic,

03:51.898 --> 03:53.358
it means you're a sitting duck.

03:53.858 --> 03:56.528
In LA, it means... you're in LA!

03:57.445 --> 03:58.780
But my brain doesn't know that,

03:58.863 --> 04:01.366
so I'm just constantly
sweating in the car.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.536
So, whatever.
On hot days, I just take my top off.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.995
[all laughing]

04:06.079 --> 04:08.539
Which has caused
some traffic jams 'cause...

04:09.374 --> 04:10.375
you know. [chuckles]

04:10.458 --> 04:11.542
[all laughing]

04:12.043 --> 04:15.004
Well, thank you for sharing, Ramona.
We hear you.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.674
[softly] Come on, girl. Get in there.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.343
Oh.

04:20.843 --> 04:21.844
Hey, hi. [chuckles]

04:21.928 --> 04:23.179
[all] Hi.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.682
This kind of attention makes me sweat.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.351
-Like her in traffic.
-[women chuckle]

04:28.435 --> 04:30.186
So, it's like... swoosh! Hello.

04:32.647 --> 04:33.648
I'm sorry.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.025
I'm fighting my nature on all of this.

04:36.108 --> 04:38.320
I'm Cuban!
You know, we don't really do therapy.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.404
I feel you.

04:39.487 --> 04:43.240
In my family, the only therapist
we're allowed to talk to is Jesus.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.786
And he must be booked up
because he has not returned my calls.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.037
[all laughing]

04:48.120 --> 04:49.372
[laughing] Oh, my...

04:49.456 --> 04:52.083
This is why I couldn't tell my mom
I was coming here.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.377
She already hates
that I'm on antidepressants.

04:54.461 --> 04:58.005
You know, to her,
therapy is for the  locos.

04:58.631 --> 05:02.927
Even my cousin Consuelo,
who wears her underpants on the outside...

05:04.679 --> 05:06.055
She doesn't do therapy.

05:06.138 --> 05:07.307
No! No, no.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.266
She's just "funny."

05:09.351 --> 05:11.311
[all laughing]

05:11.394 --> 05:13.104
Anyway, it's totally fine
if you don't feel--

05:13.187 --> 05:16.358
And try being the only person
in the history of your family

05:16.441 --> 05:19.151
that's getting a divorce.
Anybody here divorced?

05:20.362 --> 05:22.238
Oh, it's about to get shared.

05:28.536 --> 05:32.081
Okay,  queridos,
your  abuelita  is going to church!

05:33.124 --> 05:34.584
Vete con Dios, Abuelita.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.419
Shh! I'm watching  Buffy!

05:37.420 --> 05:39.213
I love you,  papito.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.131
Bye, Elena.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.176
Hi!

05:46.304 --> 05:47.138
Leslie,

05:47.221 --> 05:50.141
I told you to text me
when you were outside.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.851
I did, but you didn't respond.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.729
I don't know how to use those things.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.107
I don't know how to use them either.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.735
-We have so much in common.
-[laughs]

06:02.153 --> 06:04.739
Lydia... can I ask you something?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.784
[sighs] I am 73.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.827
I know, I look 32.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.498
Agreed.
But why do we have to keep it a secret

06:13.581 --> 06:15.625
that we're going to the opera together?

06:15.708 --> 06:18.420
Because I don't want my family to think
that something is going on.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.546
They are so crazy.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.631
They would probably think
we're out on a date. [laughs]

06:21.714 --> 06:23.633
[laughing]

06:24.551 --> 06:27.470
We-- we have different senses of humor.

06:30.181 --> 06:36.062
Oh,  mira,  we're just two people
on a lovely outing as companions.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.189
A companions' outing.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.357
How platonic.

06:40.775 --> 06:44.236
[sighs] Well, thank you so much
for joining me.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.615
I always get two tickets to stuff
in hopes that someone will go.

06:47.699 --> 06:51.536
But, Lydia, you... look beautiful.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.954
[scoffs]

06:53.037 --> 06:55.247
Uh, just careful with those shoes.
[laughs]

06:55.331 --> 06:56.833
Oh, please.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.586
I came out of the womb wearing stilettos.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.505
Even my footie pajamas
had kitten heels. [laughs]

07:02.589 --> 07:03.756
-Oh!
-Oh! Lydia!

07:04.632 --> 07:05.633
Are you okay?

07:05.717 --> 07:07.802
Oh, my shoe...

07:07.885 --> 07:10.012
My favorite shoe.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.264
Taken in the prime of its life.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.768
[Lydia grunting]

07:15.852 --> 07:16.894
[both sigh]

07:16.978 --> 07:18.521
But how about your foot?

07:19.396 --> 07:20.397
[screams]

07:21.774 --> 07:22.817
I'm fine.

07:27.363 --> 07:30.450
What's so great about  Buffy?
It's just a vampire show.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.703
Well, it's an allegory for how
strong women are in constant battle

07:33.786 --> 07:37.039
with an oppressive, bloodsucking,
male-dominated society.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.209
Whoa! Buffy's hot.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.087
I know, right?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.214
[cell phone chimes]

07:45.923 --> 07:47.216
-Oh, no.
-What?

07:47.299 --> 07:50.720
It's a text from the guy
I asked to be my  quinces  escort.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.180
He said yes. This is a disaster!

07:54.098 --> 07:55.600
Yeah, for him.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.936
[sighs] No, for me.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.856
My whole plan to get  Abuelita  off my back

08:01.939 --> 08:04.400
was to ask a popular guy
who would never do it.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.029
He rejects me, I full-on fake cry,
Abuelita  feels guilty,

08:08.112 --> 08:09.238
and boom...

08:09.321 --> 08:12.992
I escape the patriarchal tradition
of having to be escorted to my  quinces,

08:13.075 --> 08:16.204
and instead grow out my unibrow
and read a poem about Frida Kahlo.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.541
Do I have to come to your  quinces?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.418
-[clicks tongue] Who's the guy?
-Josh Flores.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.086
Josh Flores?

08:24.670 --> 08:26.464
He's like the star of the baseball team.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.926
He should be dating a hot girl
who got held back a grade, not you.

08:31.343 --> 08:33.596
-[cell phone chimes]
-[sighs]

08:33.680 --> 08:35.598
Oh, and now he says I'm cute?

08:37.141 --> 08:38.434
What?

08:39.351 --> 08:42.647
So are you gonna tell Josh
that you're not into boys?

08:42.730 --> 08:44.315
You know, that way.

08:44.398 --> 08:47.151
Well, all I said is I might be into girls.

08:47.234 --> 08:49.445
But I probably like boys, too.
I don't know.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.487
Huh?

08:50.572 --> 08:54.534
[sighs]
It's like... I've never tried broccoli.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.911
So I can't say for sure
that I don't like broccoli.

08:56.994 --> 08:59.205
We had broccoli last night for dinner.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.917
It's a metaphor, Alex.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.335
Broccoli means boys.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.212
Oh, I see...

09:06.295 --> 09:09.090
but it's not like
you tried girls before either.

09:09.173 --> 09:12.301
Sorry, I mean... I guess, cauliflower?

09:14.511 --> 09:17.599
That's because cauliflower
is a lot harder to find.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.976
I mean, how many girls do you know
that like cauliflower?

09:20.059 --> 09:21.102
None.

09:21.185 --> 09:23.312
Although, Finn is pretty sure
Denise Falto does

09:23.395 --> 09:24.772
because she didn't want his Skittles.

09:26.607 --> 09:28.234
Skittles just means Skittles.

09:33.656 --> 09:37.493
Well, let's just say
I'm open to trying broccoli.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.495
I mean,
I'm not gonna go out and buy broccoli,

09:39.579 --> 09:41.205
but if broccoli falls on my plate--

09:41.288 --> 09:42.999
Stop. I don't wanna know
what your plate is.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.005
What're you doing?

09:49.088 --> 09:50.965
I told Josh to come over.

09:51.048 --> 09:54.010
What? Josh Flores is coming over?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.386
But I haven't showered.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.682
What to wear, what to wear...

10:00.725 --> 10:02.476
Yup, you are not gonna be here.

10:02.559 --> 10:04.646
You, sir, are going to Schneider's.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.189
Ooh, you're gonna have
a boy over here alone?

10:07.273 --> 10:09.817
Yeah, you know, maybe it'll be great,
maybe it'll be terrible.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.111
-But either way, you won't be here.
-Okay!

10:12.194 --> 10:13.821
But at least mention me to Josh.

10:13.904 --> 10:16.949
Tell him I'm awesome.
No, no, too strong. Tell him I'm rad.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.828
So, I've been a civilian for ten years

10:20.912 --> 10:22.914
and I still get anxious
when I'm shopping for clothes.

10:22.997 --> 10:23.998
I feel that.

10:24.081 --> 10:27.418
Ramona, you're an amazing hype woman.
You're coming with me everywhere.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.128
You do you, girl.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.297
Seriously, I love that so much!

10:31.380 --> 10:32.924
-[all laughing]
-Yeah!

10:33.007 --> 10:35.051
Anyway, there's too many choices, right?

10:35.134 --> 10:37.386
I mean, it used to be one uniform,
which we all crushed,

10:37.469 --> 10:38.971
because we were
in the best shape of our lives.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.057
But then we get out, and it's like,

10:41.140 --> 10:44.352
why did we do all those side straddle hops
when there's Spanx?

10:44.435 --> 10:46.687
[all laughing]

10:47.647 --> 10:50.608
Anyway, Pam, pick someone else.
I don't really feel like talking today.

10:51.608 --> 10:54.486
Uh, our session ended 15 minutes ago.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.698
Thank you all for coming.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.952
[indistinct chatter]

11:06.916 --> 11:10.211
Oh, it's okay, Alvarez,
the rest of us will talk next week.

11:14.548 --> 11:17.719
It just feels so good
to let it all out with you ladies.

11:19.095 --> 11:23.265
You're just... You're all so strong
and you're so beautiful.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.768
Thank you for having me.

11:26.685 --> 11:27.979
Thank you, Penelope.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.023
Release those tears, mama!

11:31.107 --> 11:33.234
Seriously, never stop.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.492
Ay,  Leslie, this is not necessary.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.869
I fell.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.413
I have a bruise that I will cure
with the power of my mind.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.543
In the car you told me you were dizzy.

11:50.626 --> 11:54.546
I just wanna make sure you're okay
because I care about you.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.048
Okay.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.717
You may proceed.

12:01.595 --> 12:04.140
Great.
Let me just start with a few questions.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.724
Uh, any allergies?

12:06.308 --> 12:08.227
Allergies are not a real thing.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.564
All right.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.483
Uh, any history of serious illness?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.193
Never.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.945
But if ever I get one,

12:18.028 --> 12:22.366
my Cuban blood will eat it
and absorb it into nothing.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.828
There's not a checkbox for that.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.332
Any hospital visits?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.458
No.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.754
Oh! Oh, a long time ago,
I had a stroke, but it was nothing.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.634
Lydia, a stroke is not nothing.

12:40.717 --> 12:44.096
I made a 100% recovery.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.308
And I have full movement in both my arms.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.936
I can mime in a box. Can you?

13:01.113 --> 13:02.406
No, I can't.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.451
[huffing]

13:06.743 --> 13:09.205
Did you do anything
different today than usual?

13:09.288 --> 13:10.289
What did you eat?

13:10.372 --> 13:15.502
Oh, I cooked a beautiful
tortilla española,

13:15.586 --> 13:17.922
and  bistec empanizado

13:18.005 --> 13:20.174
and dinosaur nuggets. [laughs]

13:21.258 --> 13:22.759
Papito's  comfort food.

13:22.844 --> 13:24.345
And which of those did you eat?

13:24.929 --> 13:26.013
None.

13:26.097 --> 13:29.100
Well, I-- I was cooking. I had no time.

13:30.642 --> 13:32.311
Oh...

13:33.437 --> 13:36.607
That's why you're dizzy.
Lydia, you need to eat.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.443
You would make a good Cuban mother.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.363
Please.

13:42.446 --> 13:43.990
Cubans got nothing on the Jews

13:44.073 --> 13:46.242
when it comes
to force-feeding their children!

13:47.869 --> 13:51.873
Now, Lydia, if you don't mind,
I would like to take a look at that foot.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.041
Oh, okay, but no hanky-panky.

13:54.541 --> 13:57.503
My body belongs to God
and my husband's ghost.

14:00.006 --> 14:03.175
Lydia, this is a professional environment.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.260
Mmm-hmm.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.972
Ah, uh... I said no hanky-panky.

14:08.931 --> 14:12.518
This is just some
after-hours energy-saving thing.

14:13.853 --> 14:14.770
See?

14:15.354 --> 14:17.314
All right...

14:19.233 --> 14:21.818
Oh, no.
[stutters] Well, this is a problem.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.487
What? What is it?

14:23.570 --> 14:25.822
You have a hammertoe
that has to be shaved down.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.366
[gasps]

14:28.826 --> 14:29.994
I do?

14:30.703 --> 14:31.829
What does it mean?

14:32.496 --> 14:33.830
Leslie, be honest.

14:34.831 --> 14:36.458
Will I ever dance again?

14:37.751 --> 14:39.836
This is a simple out-patient procedure.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.506
We'll have you back
on your dancing feet in no time.

14:42.589 --> 14:44.091
[sighs and sniffles]

14:44.175 --> 14:46.052
Oh, no, leave it.
Leave it.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.596
Now that I have the foot of a monster,

14:48.679 --> 14:51.307
I want to hide in the shadows
until it is fixed.

14:54.851 --> 14:58.272
So, things are going good on my date.
I think we're gonna grab a coffee.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.648
Everything okay over there?

14:59.731 --> 15:00.983
Yeah, Alex is doing homework,

15:01.066 --> 15:04.612
and I'm just sitting here by myself,
you know, [chuckles] watching  Buffy.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.238
Okay, bye, Mom.

15:09.533 --> 15:10.534
So...

15:10.617 --> 15:13.037
this isn't like some bad teen movie

15:13.120 --> 15:15.998
where the popular guy
pranks the nerd girl,

15:16.082 --> 15:17.124
and you make me feel special

15:17.207 --> 15:19.543
and next thing I know,
I'm covered in pig's blood?

15:20.044 --> 15:22.088
Uh... no.

15:23.755 --> 15:24.756
It's not a prank.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.552
For real, Elena,
I've had a crush on you all year.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.179
All year? Really?

15:30.679 --> 15:33.724
I mean, there was a week
when I was home sick and puking,

15:34.141 --> 15:36.185
but you were still in there.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.729
Aw...

15:39.730 --> 15:41.398
Did you say you were watching  Buffy?

15:41.482 --> 15:43.859
-Yeah, you know it?
-Yeah, I love it.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.402
First three seasons, solid.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.197
Right? Mmm.
Where do you stand on season six?

15:48.280 --> 15:49.740
[sighs] Dark Buffy .

15:50.241 --> 15:51.408
I know, right?

15:51.492 --> 15:53.995
But I do feel like there were
some solid stand-alones, like...

15:54.078 --> 15:55.246
[both] The musical.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.166
You know...

16:00.792 --> 16:02.253
you look not that bad.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.049
I mean... you got good lips.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.218
You got nice eyes, blue.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.722
Your smile is slightly uneven,
but it's offset by a strong jaw.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.559
I think you're super hot, too.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.772
Wait, do I like you?

16:22.398 --> 16:24.608
Do you always say your thoughts out loud?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.944
Because I kinda like it.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.114
-I wanna kiss you now.
-I really like it.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.830
That wasn't horrible.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.582
[chuckles] That was not
what I was hoping to hear,

16:40.666 --> 16:41.708
but I can do better.

16:42.459 --> 16:43.460
[chuckles]

16:45.171 --> 16:46.797
Hey, Schneider, can I use your laptop?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.340
[Schneider] Yeah, sure thing, man.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.801
What, do you need to research something?
Maybe I can help.

16:50.884 --> 16:53.262
I'm trying to get information on lesbians.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.266
Oh, wow.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.643
I just typed in L-E-S
and it filled in "bians"

16:59.726 --> 17:01.770
and then a lot of other stuff.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.402
Ah...

17:10.195 --> 17:12.072
Yeah, let's shut that for now.

17:13.074 --> 17:16.618
[sighs] Um, why do you
need info on lesbians?

17:16.702 --> 17:20.372
Don't get me wrong.
I understand the curiosity, but...

17:20.956 --> 17:22.875
I'm not sure you should be doing that.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.211
I'm just trying to find out
if they also like guys.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.504
[grunts and laughs]

17:29.798 --> 17:30.841
[exhales]

17:30.924 --> 17:34.220
You have stumbled onto
a real eternal question, buddy.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.723
But probably not something
I should talk to you about

17:37.806 --> 17:39.225
without your mom's permission.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.728
And just thinking ahead,
I don't think she's gonna give permission.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.605
What, are you worried about something?

17:44.688 --> 17:48.234
I'm just confused because Elena said
she might like this dude, Josh.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.610
So?

17:49.693 --> 17:52.571
So... nothing.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.200
Wait a minute.

17:56.283 --> 17:59.411
Alex, are you saying Elena might be gay?

17:59.495 --> 18:01.789
Uh... no.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.458
Because it's a secret.

18:06.919 --> 18:07.795
Whoa.

18:07.878 --> 18:11.173
She just said she might like girls,
but she might like boys, too.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.718
Don't worry. We already had
the broccoli-cauliflower conversation.

18:18.055 --> 18:18.889
That's smart.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.268
But... [sighs] what did your mom say?

18:23.352 --> 18:25.437
She doesn't know. Nobody knows.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.856
You can't say anything.
Elena will kill me.

18:27.939 --> 18:29.525
Okay, don't worry. I won't.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.735
Even though
I have so many questions, like...

18:31.818 --> 18:33.069
When did she know?

18:33.154 --> 18:35.572
And what is
the broccoli-cauliflower conversation?

18:36.448 --> 18:37.824
It's just all so confusing.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.119
I mean, Josh is down there
with her right now.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.036
Wait a minute.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.955
Elena's downstairs alone? With a boy?

18:44.039 --> 18:45.374
Not just any boy.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.709
He's the super-cool captain
of the baseball team.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.045
Oh, that's even worse!

18:51.004 --> 18:53.632
He's probably rounding the bases
as we speak.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.095
[sighs] Somebody should do something.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.014
Oh, wait, it's me! I should do something.

19:01.097 --> 19:02.224
Okay.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.063
No, no, no, no.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.190
No.

19:18.115 --> 19:18.949
Um...

19:19.533 --> 19:22.327
I like you,
so I just don't want to mess this up.

19:22.411 --> 19:26.456
Do you think
we should talk more or something?

19:26.957 --> 19:28.667
-Um...
-No, I'm good.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.963
-You are so awesome.
-[chuckles]

19:34.798 --> 19:36.633
-Okay.
-[gasps]

19:36.717 --> 19:37.926
Hands off her!

19:39.261 --> 19:42.389
I am the go-to male authority figure here.

19:42.472 --> 19:45.434
And I am shutting
this unauthorized party down.

19:46.893 --> 19:49.313
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, sir.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.648
You were right. He is super cool.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.444
Alex, you told Schneider?

19:56.653 --> 19:57.654
Oh, hey, Josh.

20:01.908 --> 20:03.827
Alex Alvarez.

20:03.910 --> 20:05.579
Sorry, I'm a mess.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.459
I woke up with flat hair.
You know how it is.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.294
'Sup?

20:14.380 --> 20:15.506
Okay, Elena, I'm sorry.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.591
But, dude, I don't think
you're supposed to be here

20:17.674 --> 20:18.925
without a parent around.

20:19.009 --> 20:22.388
[stutters] I totally get it. I'll go.
I'll text you later.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.472
Right.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.768
Alex, I can't believe you told on me!

20:27.851 --> 20:30.229
And I am certainly glad he did,
young lady!

20:31.438 --> 20:34.316
That sounds scary. I am nailing this!

20:35.359 --> 20:36.527
It just slipped out.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.903
It's true, Elena.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.446
Alex didn't mean to tell me.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.865
He was just confused
'cause you were suddenly into a boy.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.950
Why would that be confusing?

20:45.202 --> 20:48.330
Uh...

20:48.622 --> 20:50.499
Now I'm confused.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.795
-You told him everything?
-Don't worry, Elena.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.713
I'm not gonna say anything.
It's your business.

20:56.797 --> 20:57.881
Yes, it is.

20:57.964 --> 21:00.801
The only reason I'm here is
because Alex said your mom wasn't home

21:00.884 --> 21:02.553
and there was a boy over here
and I just--

21:02.636 --> 21:03.804
There was a boy over here?

21:04.388 --> 21:06.432
[Elena groans]

21:06.515 --> 21:08.016
Abuelita,  what are you doing
home so early?

21:08.099 --> 21:10.311
-And why are you limping?
-Because she fell.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.395
In church.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.480
In church.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.275
That's where we ran into each other.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.609
I love church.

21:21.988 --> 21:24.115
Lydia, you should probably get something
for your stomach.

21:24.199 --> 21:25.701
I'll go grab you some juice.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.993
[Dr. Berkowitz grunts]

21:29.746 --> 21:31.206
Schneider...

21:31.290 --> 21:33.500
tell me everything.

21:33.583 --> 21:34.459
Of course.

21:34.960 --> 21:39.172
This super-cool dude, Josh, was over
while Alex was upstairs with me.

21:39.673 --> 21:43.385
But not to worry, 'cause I came down
to check and everything was fine.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.638
The end.

21:48.557 --> 21:49.766
I understand.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.060
My granddaughter is a sex fiend.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.897
Wait. Who's a sex fiend?

21:55.981 --> 21:58.942
Elena. She was here alone with a boy.

21:59.025 --> 22:01.570
-What?
-No. Nothing bad happened,  Abuelita.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.238
-Mom--
-Okay, you're in big trouble,

22:03.322 --> 22:05.073
'cause that means when I called you,
you lied to--

22:05.949 --> 22:07.159
Wait, Doc?

22:10.787 --> 22:12.163
What are you doing here?

22:12.247 --> 22:15.208
I came over to your house
to bring your mom some juice.

22:16.918 --> 22:17.919
Thank you.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.171
Mmm.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.674
Worth the trip. [chuckles nervously]

22:23.967 --> 22:26.553
Abuelita,  I thought you ran
into him at church.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.597
You were at a Catholic mass,
Dr. Berkowitz?

22:29.181 --> 22:30.223
What can I say?

22:31.224 --> 22:33.560
[clears throat] I hedge my bets.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.195
You're both dressed up.

22:45.238 --> 22:46.114
Wait.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.332
Were you two on a date?

22:58.084 --> 23:00.837
It was a platonic companions' outing.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.883
-What the hell does that mean?
-I don't know!

23:06.217 --> 23:09.430
How dare you insinuate
that I was lying to you!

23:09.513 --> 23:11.056
You were lying to me!

23:11.139 --> 23:13.099
A weird lie, but it's still a lie!

23:14.017 --> 23:15.060
How was your date, Mom?

23:15.143 --> 23:16.978
Hey, Alvarez, you left your phone
in my car.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.229
Whoa!

23:25.571 --> 23:27.448
This is your date?

23:29.533 --> 23:32.160
So much to process today.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.913
So much.

23:35.789 --> 23:38.166
Oh, honey, no, no, no.
Your mom and I weren't on a date.

23:38.249 --> 23:41.419
I mean, she should be so lucky. [chuckles]

23:41.503 --> 23:42.921
We were just at therapy.

23:44.923 --> 23:45.757
Um...

23:46.467 --> 23:48.760
Therapy's the name of a hot new club.

23:52.639 --> 23:53.473
Fixed it.

23:56.143 --> 23:56.977
Bye, girl.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.815
You were in therapy?

24:03.191 --> 24:05.193
No, I was on a date with a woman.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.404
[Lydia]  Mentira!

24:08.489 --> 24:09.990
Therapy is for the  locos.

24:10.073 --> 24:15.287
I told you that you would lose your mind
taking those antiperspirants.

24:18.289 --> 24:20.584
And how dare you keep a secret from me?

24:20.667 --> 24:23.169
Lydia, take it easy.
You have a history of stroke.

24:24.087 --> 24:25.046
You had a stroke?

24:25.130 --> 24:26.381
I kept it a secret from you.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.467
You kept it a secret from me?

24:29.551 --> 24:31.845
It was nothing.
You were pregnant with Elena.

24:31.928 --> 24:33.180
I didn't want to bother you.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.891
This was 15 years ago!
I can't believe you!

24:35.974 --> 24:39.019
I have a hammertoe
that needs to be shaved.

24:40.812 --> 24:44.107
How dare you attack me
when I'm about to go under the knife?

24:45.817 --> 24:49.112
This is obviously
a very personal family matter.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.489
Yeah, you should go.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.407
Both of you.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.208
What? I thought we were doing a thing--
Okay.

25:06.421 --> 25:07.464
Elena...

25:08.006 --> 25:09.382
I can't believe you lied.

25:09.465 --> 25:11.134
Well, you went to therapy
and said it was a date.

25:11.217 --> 25:12.260
I can't believe you lied.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.804
I am the mom! I'm allowed to lie!

25:15.305 --> 25:17.641
And I am the mom's mom
and I get to lie even more!

25:19.350 --> 25:20.351
No...

25:21.269 --> 25:24.898
She is the one who is going boy crazy
with this  cabrón,  Josh.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.983
Josh agreed to be my  quinces  escort.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.484
A wonderful boy.

25:30.820 --> 25:31.947
He is.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.658
I'm sorry I had him here
when no one was home.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.826
And I'm sorry I lied about it.
It was stupid.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.830
Apology accepted,
but you're still grounded.

25:41.164 --> 25:42.207
And you...

25:42.708 --> 25:45.418
When you have a stroke and don't die,

25:45.501 --> 25:46.587
you tell people.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.007
First thing Monday, I'm taking you
to get a full physical.

25:51.091 --> 25:54.177
And not by Dr. Berkowitz
'cause now you've made that weird.

25:55.721 --> 25:59.015
Okay,  perdóname
for not telling you about the stroke.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.809
And I'm sorry that I lied about therapy.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.310
But I hope you can understand why.

26:03.144 --> 26:04.563
Because it's shameful.

26:07.107 --> 26:10.235
Not even your cousin Consuelo
goes to therapy.

26:10.318 --> 26:13.071
She fights the crazy
like a strong woman should.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.448
Okay. So this is why I lied.

26:17.033 --> 26:18.159
Oh,  Mami,  look...

26:19.411 --> 26:21.538
It was... it was really great.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.541
It was a bunch of women that I related to

26:24.624 --> 26:26.918
sharing our feelings and our experiences.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.379
And it made me really happy.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.090
Ay,  okay. Relax.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.717
Who said anything?

26:35.218 --> 26:37.053
Ay.  [mutters] Okay.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.513
So no more secrets.

26:39.347 --> 26:42.058
Is there anything else
anybody wants to tell me? Speak now.

26:44.561 --> 26:45.562
All right.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.313
Let me talk to her.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.690
Alex, help  Abuelita.

26:53.403 --> 26:55.071
[sighing]

26:56.740 --> 26:57.574
So...

26:59.117 --> 27:00.243
Josh?

27:01.327 --> 27:02.746
What do you wanna know?

27:04.205 --> 27:05.331
Nothing happened?

27:05.415 --> 27:07.709
-Mom!
-Come on. I'm...

27:07.793 --> 27:09.377
You've never shown an interest
in a boy before.

27:09.461 --> 27:13.173
And it's exciting. It's... terrifying.
But it's mostly exciting.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.218
We kissed. But that's it.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.013
And how was it?

27:21.473 --> 27:22.557
It was okay.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.560
Okay? All right.

27:26.978 --> 27:27.854
I get it.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.693
[sighs] My first kiss was weird,
because I had braces.

27:32.776 --> 27:35.779
And the guy said he could taste
the  plátano  stuck in my rubber bands.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.783
But lucky for me, he was Cuban.
He didn't mind.

27:41.534 --> 27:43.536
[Lydia] You should've married him!

27:44.913 --> 27:46.372
-[both chuckle]
-Oh, my God.

27:46.456 --> 27:47.623
So...

27:48.750 --> 27:49.876
Do you like Josh?

27:50.836 --> 27:51.837
Yeah.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.381
I mean, he likes  Buffy
and he has nice eyes.

27:55.006 --> 27:58.051
But if I'm being honest,
I think Alex is more into him than me.

27:58.551 --> 28:00.846
Seriously, guys.
How good do I look in this?
