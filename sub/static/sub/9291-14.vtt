00:14.760 --> 00:19.520
We know you printed a document
before the EMP detonated. Where is it?

00:19.600 --> 00:22.000
You decide when the pain stops.

00:25.560 --> 00:28.520
Drop your gun or I'll kill him.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.120
Paul, where's the data printout?

00:31.200 --> 00:32.479
I hid it.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.200
- Is this it?
- Yeah. It's in code.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.840
I couldn't make any sense out of it.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.480
We need to get it back to CTU.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.280
I appreciate you carrying the ball
until Michelle got here.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.880
Why don't you
bring everyone up to speed?

00:43.960 --> 00:47.000
The man responsible
for planning today's attacks, Habib Marwan,

00:47.080 --> 00:49.680
has been a long-term employee
of McLennan-Forster.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.840
Jack and Paul Raines
went to inspect his computer files.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.800
As they were doing so,
an EMP bomb was detonated,

00:55.880 --> 00:57.760
wiping out the company's database.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.320
We have to assume
whoever detonated the EMP

01:00.400 --> 01:03.000
wants Jack and Paul eliminated.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.360
- Why are we going here?
- Weapons and ammunition.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.920
" Get out of here!
The next one won't miss.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.920
I'm a federal agent. Look, we need your help.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.120
Who's after you?

01:15.200 --> 01:17.320
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.680
I have evidence
that I need to get to the authorities.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.320
If you're fighting the people who
caused today's bloodshed, we'll help you.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.760
It's time.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.320
- Jack!
- I'm here.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.320
- You safe?
- Yeah.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.720
I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.640
Jack, look out!

01:50.000 --> 01:53.960
Paul? Paul! Get me a medic.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.320
It's time for you to go.
Are you ready?

02:00.400 --> 02:03.040
Yes, of course.

02:03.120 --> 02:07.680
Proceed as planned. The President
of the United States is on a tight schedule.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.479
We can't be late.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.200
He's bleeding out. Tell 'em
we need two litres of A-positive haemo.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.760
" Roger that.

02:25.840 --> 02:30.000
Come on, Paul.
Stay with us. We're almost there.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.520
- Hello.
- "Audrey, it's me."

02:41.600 --> 02:44.280
Oh, Jack. Thank God you're all right.

02:44.360 --> 02:48.640
Audrey, I need you to listen to me.
Paul's been shot.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.000
Audrey?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.320
Audrey?

02:58.400 --> 02:59.500
How bad is it?

02:59.560 --> 03:04.120
The medics are working on him.
We'll be there in a few minutes.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.920
Jack, how did this happen?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.800
One of the gunmen tried to shoot me.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.400
Paul pushed me out of the way.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.680
He saved my life.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.280
Audrey?

03:20.080 --> 03:22.920
I'm here. I just...

03:23.000 --> 03:26.920
- Jack, I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.120
Surgeons are standing by.
We're gonna do everything that we have to.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.640
- "You understand that?"
- Yeah, I understand.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.480
I'm sorry.

03:38.560 --> 03:39.800
I gotta go.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.160
- See you in a minute.
- Yeah. OK.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.960
Mr President, all the evidence we've gathered
confirms that this one man, Habib Marwan,

03:57.040 --> 03:59.840
is responsible for everything
that's happened today.

03:59.920 --> 04:04.680
The train derailment, my abduction,
the sabotage of our nuclear power plants.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.440
Does evidence suggest
he is planning more attacks?

04:07.520 --> 04:12.720
I'm afraid so. NSA is reporting a spike in
chatter. They're sifting through the intel now,

04:12.800 --> 04:16.120
trying to determine
potential targets and time frames.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.680
- Trying is not good enough.
- " The chopper is about to land.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.760
We need to pre-empt further attacks.

04:21.839 --> 04:26.040
I understand, sir. Our best chance
of doing that is by capturing Marwan.

04:26.120 --> 04:29.160
- How close are you?
- Jack Bauer recovered a document

04:29.240 --> 04:33.320
we believe contains contact data
on Marwan's network.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.280
CTU is using it to track Marwan.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.520
- And if that fails?
- "We just have to hope that it doesn't."

04:41.760 --> 04:43.320
Jim,

04:43.400 --> 04:48.000
today's events are continuing
to generate an unprecedented level of fear.

04:48.080 --> 04:52.600
I'm not sure the social and civil fabric
of this country can withstand another attack.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.960
- "We need to make provisions."
- Provisions?

04:55.040 --> 04:59.520
The civil unrest that I believe is inevitable
in the event of another strike.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.120
Are you saying
we should impose martial law?

05:02.200 --> 05:05.960
General Wakefield will meet with you
in LA to discuss our options.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.960
- When?
- Now. His plane landed.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.640
He'll be calling you
to confirm a secure location.

05:12.720 --> 05:17.520
- And, Jim, keep this between us.
- Of course, Mr President.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.960
" He's still falling.

05:48.040 --> 05:53.040
" He's losing pressure. I need ten
cc's of adrenaline, no compression. Let's go.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.320
Paul. Paul, can you hear me?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.480
- Paul.
- We gotta get him to surgery now.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.160
- Paul.
- Let's go.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.520
I'm sorry.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.320
Please tell me he's not gonna die.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.400
Come here.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.800
Please.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.400
Jack, tell me.

06:15.480 --> 06:18.280
We don't know. We just don't know.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.800
- Jack, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

06:27.880 --> 06:31.520
- We pulled a name off the list you sent us.
- Who is it?

06:31.600 --> 06:34.680
Someone on our watch list.
We had no idea he was with Marwan.

06:34.760 --> 06:37.840
Come on inside. We'll talk you through it.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.840
You need to stay out here
while your husband's prepped for surgery.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.320
Please, can I just talk to him for a second?

06:47.400 --> 06:50.200
Paul, hey. Hey, it's Audrey.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.480
Listen to me.

06:53.200 --> 06:57.280
I just want you to know
that I'm here, OK? I'm here.

06:58.840 --> 07:03.360
- " We need to prep him now.
- I will be here when you get out of surgery.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.480
Paul?

07:05.560 --> 07:08.440
" Get him prepped and ready.

07:15.880 --> 07:19.760
Joseph Fayed, professor
at Green University, chemical engineering.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.120
Came to the US in 1985.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.760
We're sending in a tactical team
to pick him up.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.360
- That's a mistake.
- Why?

07:26.440 --> 07:31.200
Marwan's vetted his inner circle carefully.
That man'll die before he says anything.

07:31.280 --> 07:36.160
You're probably right, Jack,
but what can we do besides arrest Fayed?

07:36.240 --> 07:40.040
Send someone in undercover.
They might lead you to Marwan.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.080
We don't have time to put
one of our people undercover.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.680
I'm not talking about one of our people.
Dina Araz.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.520
We've granted her son immunity.
We have nothing left to offer her.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.720
Maybe not. I'll talk to her
while you mobilise a tactical team.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.320
If I can't get her to cooperate, send them in.

07:56.400 --> 08:02.300
It's simple - we either find Marwan, or we will
not be able to stop what he's planning next.

08:17.400 --> 08:21.600
Meet them at the hotel, Old River Road,
half a kilometre from the base.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.800
- When?
- Leave now.

08:23.880 --> 08:28.200
I'll need his flight package,
including clearance and identification codes.

08:28.280 --> 08:31.520
You'll have whatever you need.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.520
Is that all you've got?

08:47.440 --> 08:52.840
- For now it is.
- Come on, I haven't seen you in two weeks.

08:52.920 --> 08:57.320
Yeah, I've gotta get to the base.
I'm flying tonight.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.000
Damn. I'm gonna be late as it is.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.040
- Oh, look at me. I'm all wrinkled.
- I wouldn't worry about that.

09:14.640 --> 09:15.880
Hello.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.280
I need to talk to John.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.120
- It's for you.
- What?

09:22.480 --> 09:24.960
It's your wife.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.640
But it's your cellphone.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.800
Laurie.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.760
They say they'll kill the children
unless you do what they want.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.840
- What's going on, Laurie? Who's there?
- I don't know.

09:44.920 --> 09:48.440
Listen to me, Laurie.
Whoever's there, you put them on the phone.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.760
Please don't let them hurt the children.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.080
Laurie.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.160
Laurie, put...

09:58.240 --> 10:00.840
Put your clothes on, John.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.900
Curtis is prepping the tactical teams, which
means you have five minutes to do this.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.880
Do you recognise this man?

10:28.960 --> 10:31.800
- No.
- He's connected to Marwan.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.840
I don't know him.
I already told the other agent.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.800
Marwan doesn't permit
communication between cells.

10:40.880 --> 10:45.960
His name is Joseph Fayed.
He's a professor at Green University.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.000
You know more about him than I do.

10:49.920 --> 10:53.520
He's also our only way to reach Marwan.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.440
We can't do that without your help.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.840
Why should I help you?

10:58.920 --> 11:03.560
I've already gotten
all I'm going to get for cooperating.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.960
That's not necessarily true.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.520
I know you love your son.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.120
You've already shown me that today.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.440
But unless you help us get to Fayed,

11:23.520 --> 11:28.960
that'll be the last time you see him
for the rest of your life.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.800
- Dessler.
- " The teams are in place."

11:33.880 --> 11:36.880
All right. Have them stand by.

11:37.480 --> 11:41.720
Tactical teams are ready.
They can be at Fayed's house in ten minutes.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.880
Let's give him another minute.

11:44.960 --> 11:49.680
I'm offering you freedom. You and Behrooz
will go into a witness protection programme.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.720
You'll be given new names,
identities, everything.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.680
This is what you told me you wanted.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.800
I'm offering you a life with your son.

12:01.200 --> 12:05.680
Right now, the only question is
which life do you want?

12:16.240 --> 12:18.720
We're out of time.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.560
What do you need me to do?

12:31.120 --> 12:36.200
I need you to go to Fayed, and tell him
that you need to speak to Marwan.

12:36.280 --> 12:40.200
He won't let me through his front door,
let alone get near Marwan.

12:40.280 --> 12:44.000
He will when you tell him
that you've got a hostage that can help him.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.000
A hostage? Who?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.360
Me.

13:03.720 --> 13:07.240
So what's this all about? What are you doing?

13:07.320 --> 13:10.960
- I'm delivering you to someone.
- Who?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.520
- I don't know.
- You don't know who you work for?

13:13.600 --> 13:16.800
- I work for myself.
- Somebody's paying you.

13:16.880 --> 13:22.780
I don't ask them who they are,
and they don't tell me. That's how I stay alive.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.840
All right. It's time.

13:40.440 --> 13:44.360
If you don't cooperate, your family will die.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.800
Do you understand?

14:05.040 --> 14:07.640
It's all there. Get out of here.

14:11.200 --> 14:15.320
Get your things. We've got a plane to catch.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.560
Increased chatter indicates
Marwan is planning another strike.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.720
It is imperative we locate him
before he triggers this.

14:22.800 --> 14:28.040
We are mounting an undercover operation
to lead us to him through this man.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.200
Joseph Fayed.

14:30.280 --> 14:34.600
We've struck a deal with Dina Araz to
work undercover for us and approach Fayed.

14:34.680 --> 14:38.360
- Marwan knows we have Araz in custody.
- We will use that to our advantage.

14:38.440 --> 14:42.960
- Jack will run us through the cover story.
- The cover story goes as follows.

14:43.040 --> 14:46.760
An hour ago, I was transporting Araz
to the federal detention centre.

14:46.840 --> 14:50.480
My vehicle was attacked by members
of a terrorist cell run by Navi Araz

14:50.560 --> 14:52.840
at the intersection of Sepulveda and National.

14:52.920 --> 14:56.320
I managed to kill all of the attackers,
but during the engagement

14:56.400 --> 14:59.920
Dina Araz secured one of the weapons
and took me hostage.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.800
She'll take me to Fayed.
He'll take me to Marwan.

15:02.880 --> 15:06.160
- Marwan takes the bait, we track you to him.
- Yeah.

15:06.240 --> 15:10.800
They're gonna search both Jack and Dina,
which makes surveillance a problem.

15:10.880 --> 15:15.560
We'll handle this passively. We'll use
satellite parabolics and laser aggregators.

15:15.640 --> 15:19.040
You think Dina Araz'll be able
to play this convincingly?

15:19.120 --> 15:23.480
She's lived in the United States
for five years while part of a terrorist cell.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.040
Yes. She's an expert at deception.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.280
As long as she doesn't deceive us.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.520
This is our best
and only chance at finding Marwan.

15:31.600 --> 15:36.200
No matter how well we fabricate this story,
Jack will be in extreme, immediate danger.

15:36.280 --> 15:41.840
We have to be able to move in at the first sign
of trouble. There is zero tolerance for error.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.120
- Thank you.
- Good luck, everyone.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.960
Curtis, the detainees from McLennan-Forster
have been taken to Division.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.160
- Run the interrogation.
- You got it.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.080
Thank you.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.960
Edgar, I want you to call LAPD and Caltrans.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.680
Their logs need to reflect
that the ambush took place.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.040
I need an exact time window.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.840
He just finished telling us. An hour ago.

16:07.920 --> 16:12.000
- I didn't know if there was an update.
- No, you weren't paying attention.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.160
We can't afford for you
to lose focus at a time like this.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.840
I'm sick of people saying
I don't know what I'm doing.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.440
Especially people who
don't really work here.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.160
Is there a problem with Edgar?

16:28.240 --> 16:34.140
His mother was caught in a contamination
zone at San Gabriel. She took her own life.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.480
Up till now he's been handling it well.
It might be catching up with him.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.600
Do you think he can run
the comm part of this operation?

16:41.680 --> 16:44.840
Based on whatjust happened? No.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.480
I didn't see Chloe on the active roster.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.920
- Yeah, well, Driscoll forced her to resign.
- Why?

16:52.000 --> 16:55.800
Apparently, Chloe went against
Driscoll's orders, sided with Jack.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.720
Turns out Jack was right.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.800
Thank you.

17:16.319 --> 17:17.520
Hello.

17:17.599 --> 17:21.200
- Chloe. Michelle Dessler.
- Are you calling me from Division?

17:21.280 --> 17:25.440
I'm back at CTU. Secretary Heller
asked me to take Erin Driscoll's place.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.839
She got fired? That's too bad.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.000
Tell Edgar to upgrade
the pattern-recognition software.

17:31.080 --> 17:34.040
- He gets overwhelmed.
- I'll make sure he takes care of that.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.880
- Thanks.
- "Listen, Chloe,"

17:36.960 --> 17:40.040
you're better at what you do
than anyone I've worked with.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.240
I need you here.

17:43.320 --> 17:46.360
Thank you for saying that,
but I've had enough for today.

17:46.440 --> 17:50.120
Chloe, this would be for Jack,
notjust for CTU.

17:50.200 --> 17:54.280
- What are you talking about?
- He's about to go into a high-risk operation.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.280
We need to mount massive
surveillance in little time.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.320
I'm not confident
that Edgar can do this on his own.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.320
- Well, there's nothing I can do about that.
- Chloe,

18:03.400 --> 18:07.320
I just need a few hours of your time,
and then you can move on.

18:07.400 --> 18:12.080
I just wanna do everything I can
to ensure Jack's safety.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.440
Fine. But it's just for today.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.600
- Thank you, Chloe.
- You're welcome.

18:22.440 --> 18:25.960
Set cars up at the ambush site
in case Marwan wants to verify.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.640
Use dead bodies of terrorists
from Heller's rescue.

18:28.720 --> 18:33.520
The follow team will stay as close as they
can, but you're flying without a net here.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.360
If a hostile decides
to take you out without warning,

18:36.440 --> 18:39.440
- there's nothing we can do.
- I know.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.960
Audrey's still at the clinic.
There's time if you wanna say goodbye.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.800
She's got a lot on her mind right now.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.680
Jack, she should know
what you're about to do.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.720
She's been through enough today.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.920
Look over the time line.
We'll talk through the details.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.280
I'm not doing anything until I see my son.

19:16.360 --> 19:22.160
- We don't have time for that right now.
- Seeing my son is non-negotiable.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.040
Tony.

19:32.720 --> 19:36.240
Learn every aspect of the cover story.
Your life depends on it.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.560
Don't worry about me.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.280
You can see your son,
but only for a minute. That's all. Let's go.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.760
Mom.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.040
They wouldn't tell me where you were
or if I'd see you again.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.520
We are going to be together.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.960
What? They wouldn't let you come with me.

20:18.040 --> 20:21.320
Everything has changed.
I agreed to do something for them,

20:21.400 --> 20:24.280
and they'll let me go with you.

20:25.240 --> 20:29.040
- What do they want you to do?
- Help them find Marwan.

20:29.120 --> 20:32.640
- It's too dangerous.
- Oh, I can handle Marwan.

20:32.720 --> 20:37.240
- Please, Mom, no.
- Don't worry. I'll be fine.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.560
Please, Mom.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.840
Mrs Araz, it's time.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.040
- Is field surveillance in place?
- We have audio.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.080
We should be able to hear inside the house.

21:22.160 --> 21:25.040
That's assuming they get that far.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.040
- OK. Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.920
Come on. Come on.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.200
- Why aren't you going through?
- " Use a Danziger filter.

21:33.280 --> 21:37.200
You can download it internally
if you know what you're doing. You're in.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.640
- Why are you here?
- Michelle asked me to help.

21:39.720 --> 21:44.120
- I'll cover your overflow.
- I can handle my assignment.

21:44.200 --> 21:47.160
You can't, otherwise
Michelle wouldn't have called me in.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.960
Edgar, I meant to tell you
before Chloe got here.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.080
I can do my job. I don't need any help.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.760
I'm not saying you can't,
but I'm not taking chances.

21:54.840 --> 21:59.560
- I know we got off to a rocky start, but...
- Edgar, this isn't a debate. It's an order.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.320
Brief Chloe so she can
run satellite with you.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.880
Jack's approaching
the staging area now.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.480
- Baron.
- Dessler. We're set on our end.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.720
Teams are in place. Go in at your discretion.

22:19.800 --> 22:23.480
Roger that. We'll leave this line open.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.000
We are going in alone?

22:47.080 --> 22:50.040
Our agents are conducting audio surveillance.

22:50.120 --> 22:54.080
- What does that mean?
- Acknowledge that you can hear me.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.840
Copy that.

22:58.520 --> 23:02.720
- What are you doing?
- I have to make it look like I was injured.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.360
Take my gun.

23:22.440 --> 23:25.360
This has to look as convincing
as possible. Take my gun.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.760
You must know that I want to kill you.

23:28.840 --> 23:32.040
Yes, but you won't because of Behrooz.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.520
Let's go.

23:42.240 --> 23:45.760
- They're going in.
- " We're standing by.

23:57.640 --> 24:02.320
- What if Fayed doesn't believe us?
- Then we're both dead.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.040
... people were evacuating
the San Gabriel Island area.

24:06.120 --> 24:09.680
As you can see here
from footage that was shot earlier...

24:11.480 --> 24:13.880
... people tried to evacuate.

24:23.640 --> 24:26.600
- Who is it?
- Joseph, it's Dina Araz.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.320
- Who?
- Dina Araz. I'm a friend.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.480
My husband is Navi. He's been killed.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.760
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.920
- I need to speak to Marwan.
- I don't know any Marwan.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.560
- Yes, you do.
- Go away before I call the police.

24:40.640 --> 24:44.520
You won't call the police,
and we both know why.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.120
- What do you want?
- I have a hostage.

24:49.200 --> 24:54.160
Someone Marwan will want.
His name is Jack Bauer, he's a CTU agent.

24:54.240 --> 24:57.520
Now, please let me in
before someone sees me.

25:06.320 --> 25:09.160
Close the door.
Put your gun over there. Do it.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.360
- How did you find me?
- My husband told me.

25:31.440 --> 25:35.360
- I don't know your husband.
- He knew you.

25:35.440 --> 25:40.200
- Tell me what happened.
- My husband was killed, and I was arrested.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.560
They were transporting me to CTU.

25:42.640 --> 25:46.600
I heard an explosion,
and the van we were driving crashed.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.880
It was our people.
They came to rescue me.

25:49.960 --> 25:55.860
Everyone fell, except Bauer and me. He was
wounded, and I managed to get his gun.

25:56.600 --> 26:00.040
- " Where?"
- The intersection of Sepulveda and National.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.360
Half a mile from here.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.520
Don't move.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.720
- " What is it?
- "This is Fayed."

26:16.800 --> 26:19.000
A woman named Dina Araz came to me.

26:19.080 --> 26:22.400
- How did she find you?
- She claims her husband told her.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.720
- "What does she want?"
- She has a hostage.

26:24.800 --> 26:29.480
- "A CTU agent named Jack Bauer."
- Jack Bauer?

26:32.520 --> 26:37.400
- Can you break into the other side?
- No, the signal's scrambled.

26:37.920 --> 26:42.400
Our people ambushed a vehicle
at the intersection of Sepulveda and National.

26:42.480 --> 26:45.120
Everyone was killed,
but she escaped with Bauer.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.800
What do you want me to do?

26:48.720 --> 26:51.400
Bring them to me.

26:51.480 --> 26:55.720
I will call you back in five minutes
with the details. Be ready.

26:55.800 --> 26:58.880
- Do you understand?
- "Yes."

27:00.040 --> 27:02.240
I understand.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.480
Marwan wants to see him.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.960
- Baron, it's a go.
- I heard.

27:16.040 --> 27:19.440
Set a follow grid.
We'll coordinate from our end.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.320
- Evening, sir.
- Evening.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.760
Pop the trunk for me, sir.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.920
Since when are you searching
officers' cars at the gate?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.200
Elevated threat level.

28:37.560 --> 28:41.080
- OK. You're good to go, sir.
- Thank you.

29:14.160 --> 29:17.640
- I'm on base.
- " Proceed as planned."

29:19.960 --> 29:22.280
- Let me talk to my family.
- Open the trunk.

29:22.360 --> 29:26.680
- Let me talk to my wife.
- I said open the trunk.

29:26.760 --> 29:29.120
Please. Let me talk to my family.

29:29.200 --> 29:34.520
Your family is dead. And so are you.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.240
Mrs Raines.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.720
Your husband sustained bullet wounds
to his chest and abdomen.

30:27.800 --> 30:31.360
We extracted one bullet,
but I called a neurosurgeon in from Cedars

30:31.440 --> 30:34.880
- to help extract the second bullet.
- Why a neurosurgeon?

30:34.960 --> 30:38.240
Well, the bullet is lodged
against his T5 vertebra,

30:38.320 --> 30:41.280
and we want to avoid
any further spinal trauma.

30:41.360 --> 30:44.440
I can't believe this is happening.

30:44.520 --> 30:49.680
- I'll let you know as soon as I get any news.
- " Thank you.

31:01.720 --> 31:04.240
Dad...

31:04.320 --> 31:08.640
I don't think I realised
how much I care for Paul until now.

31:15.320 --> 31:21.220
I know this is terrible timing, but
the president has called and I have to leave.

31:24.360 --> 31:30.260
You'll be able to reach me on my number.
The doctors will keep me up to speed here.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.440
OK.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.920
I love you, Audrey.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.720
And I'm proud to be your dad.

31:42.760 --> 31:45.160
I love you, too.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.080
Be careful.

32:05.040 --> 32:07.880
- Where are you taking me?
- Shut up.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.040
How far are we going?

32:18.120 --> 32:20.320
It won't be long.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.240
You look nervous.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.080
What do you expect?

32:27.160 --> 32:31.200
I wouldn't have contacted you
if I felt I had a choice.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.880
And as a result, I have no choice.

32:33.960 --> 32:38.640
We do whatever we have to for the cause.
So what's the problem?

32:38.720 --> 32:41.000
There is no problem.

32:43.720 --> 32:46.080
They're turning off Olympic.

32:46.160 --> 32:49.120
Moving to the next subchannel.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.200
He's turning onto a side street.

32:51.280 --> 32:55.160
- "Collier Avenue. Hold that distance."
- Understood.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.760
He's heading towards the Broad Street tunnel.

33:03.840 --> 33:06.840
He's slowing down. Baron, drop back.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.680
- "We can't have him spot the tail."
- We're backing off.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.080
- "He's turning into the tunnel."
- Maintain your distance.

33:19.440 --> 33:23.040
He's too far ahead.
We won't be able to hear what's going on.

33:23.120 --> 33:27.360
" The tunnel is 400 yards long.
They'll be out of view for 20 seconds.

33:38.800 --> 33:42.400
" Pull in front of this truck.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.080
- What's going on?
- " Get out of the car.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.880
What are you doing?

33:58.640 --> 34:01.240
- From Marwan.
- Yes.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.840
This is taking too long.

34:23.239 --> 34:25.760
- They're outta the tunnel.
- Do you have a visual?

34:25.840 --> 34:28.920
" That's it. We got him up ahead.

34:30.920 --> 34:34.880
- Fayed's turning onto Napier.
- Napier loops back around to Olympic.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.840
He just spent the last five minutes
driving in a circle.

34:37.920 --> 34:41.159
Maybe he's trying to detect surveillance.

34:41.239 --> 34:44.480
- Chloe, can you switch to infrared?
- Hold on.

34:48.520 --> 34:52.239
- There's only one person in the car.
- They made a switch in the tunnel.

34:52.320 --> 34:56.600
The covert part of the operation is over.
All teams, move in on the target car.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.680
Alpha team, cut him off at the bridge.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.760
Establish a perimeter.
Stop and search all vehicles.

35:01.840 --> 35:05.240
- Anything on satellite?
- Nothing around the immediate area.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.560
- Can you go back into archives?
- It'll take a few minutes.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.760
- Do it.
- Baron, what's your status?

35:10.840 --> 35:12.920
We're closing in now.

35:17.040 --> 35:22.240
We got him
surrounded on the bridge. I'll take the lead.

35:23.920 --> 35:27.080
- Passenger side.
- On the left.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.400
Flank him.

35:30.480 --> 35:35.440
- Get out of the car, and put your hands up.
- " Out of the car!

35:37.640 --> 35:40.000
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

35:47.400 --> 35:50.080
Oh, my God.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.320
Marwan set us up.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.880
- Almeida.
- "This is Alden. Baron's dead."

36:21.960 --> 36:24.040
So is Fayed. Is there any sign of Jack?

36:24.120 --> 36:27.480
- No. Any other hostiles in the area?
- No, the area looks secure.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.760
OK. I'll get you another backup team
as soon as I can.

36:30.840 --> 36:34.040
- I have the archive satellite footage.
- Play it back.

36:34.120 --> 36:38.360
OK. During the time Fayed's car
is in the tunnel, three vehicles exit.

36:38.440 --> 36:42.040
- Check the van.
- Can you get me a licence number on that?

36:42.120 --> 36:46.720
Not from the satellite. I'll check the traffic
cameras. Get me the Caltrans interface.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.160
We have a socket open. Logging in.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.120
Done.

36:54.760 --> 36:58.440
OK, there's a camera
at the entrance to the tunnel.

36:58.520 --> 37:01.160
Looking for the right frame.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.119
Got it.

37:10.120 --> 37:13.440
Send this out to all field teams.
I want support setting up the grid.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.960
I'm on it.

37:15.040 --> 37:18.360
We have an ID on a vehicle.
White Chevy van, late '90s,

37:18.440 --> 37:21.600
licence plate - Charlie Victor Alpha 322.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.160
Get up.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.960
You've caused me a lot of trouble.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.760
Sorry for your loss, Dina.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.280
Navi was a great man.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.960
I hope my men weren't too rough with you.
It was necessary,

38:14.040 --> 38:16.240
in case you were under surveillance.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.560
I understand.

38:18.640 --> 38:21.920
But we weren't followed. I was careful.

38:23.520 --> 38:26.520
- You're a good liar, Dina.
- What?

38:26.600 --> 38:30.720
Fayed martyred himself.
The men who were following you are dead.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.800
- What men?
- Enough with the lies.

38:35.680 --> 38:39.520
Marwan, please believe me.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.760
I did not betray you.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.880
Prove it to me.

38:54.840 --> 38:57.400
Kill him.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.640
Just what I thought.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.840
Get him out of here.

41:27.280 --> 41:30.120
