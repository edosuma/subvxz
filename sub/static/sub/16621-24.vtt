WEBVTT

00:04.071 --> 00:06.371
(glass breaking, thudding)
Sam, someone's in the house!

00:06.406 --> 00:07.773
(screaming)

00:07.808 --> 00:08.474
(grunting)

00:08.509 --> 00:09.541
MAN:
Release Tahir Khaled,

00:09.577 --> 00:12.277
or watch your wife
suffocate to death, Sam Hanna.

00:12.312 --> 00:13.678
Ticktock, Sam.

00:13.713 --> 00:16.715
SECNAV has just authorized

00:16.750 --> 00:18.683
<i> Tahir's release.</i>

00:18.718 --> 00:19.584
I want my time with you

00:19.619 --> 00:21.586
and my children.
CALLEN:
<i> We just passed</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:23.689
hour eight. There's still
no word from Tahir's people.

00:28.795 --> 00:30.729
(crying):
Please.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.069
Okay, thanks.

00:38.105 --> 00:40.072
LAPD is on top of it.

00:40.107 --> 00:41.773
You okay?

00:41.808 --> 00:43.809
No, not even close.

00:45.312 --> 00:48.747
I got a flight to take you
to Kamran and Aiden.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.248
Already spoke to 'em.

00:50.283 --> 00:52.317
They know I'll be there
as soon as I can.

00:52.352 --> 00:55.287
Sam, their mother
just died.

00:58.225 --> 01:02.327
Me going there is not
gonna bring her back.

01:02.362 --> 01:06.832
Right now I have to find Tahir
and whoever it is that did this.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.809
(car door opens)

01:21.848 --> 01:23.815
(sighs)

01:23.850 --> 01:26.751
You know we're not gonna be
allowed to work on this case

01:26.786 --> 01:28.687
in any official capacity.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.722
Who's gonna stop me?

01:32.192 --> 01:34.359
Go to your kids.

01:34.394 --> 01:37.829
They need you now
more than anything.

01:37.864 --> 01:41.166
We got this. I will call you
the minute we have a lead.

01:41.201 --> 01:43.668
You should get out.

01:43.703 --> 01:45.704
I don't think so.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.775
You don't want to
be a part of this.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.446
We are partners...

01:54.481 --> 01:57.116
through good and bad.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.689
(sighs)

02:06.393 --> 02:08.860
I'm gonna hurt people, G.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.896
Yeah.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.769
Well, I guess it's time for
a career change for both of us.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.273
Last chance.

02:21.308 --> 02:25.343
No turning back
once we're in this.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.479
We're already in this.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.816
(engine starts)

02:31.851 --> 02:33.852
(engine revving)

02:38.992 --> 02:41.460
¶ ¶

03:02.449 --> 03:03.548
(tires screech, car crashes)

03:03.583 --> 03:04.917
(groans)

03:08.421 --> 03:10.856
Really, lady?

03:13.460 --> 03:15.727
I am so sorry. I looked
down for a second.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.596
Were you texting?
No!

03:17.631 --> 03:18.797
Uh...

03:18.832 --> 03:21.800
No, and, uh,
I have insurance.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.945
Hey, you guys
hanging in there?

03:33.980 --> 03:35.947
Yeah. You?

03:35.982 --> 03:37.949
Okay.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.219
Where are Sam and Callen?

03:40.954 --> 03:42.354
I assumed they came back here.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.356
God. Maybe it's just as well.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.691
I just got a call from
the coroner's office.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.493
The van that was
carrying Michelle's body

03:48.528 --> 03:49.861
has been hijacked.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.029
What?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.998
Oh, my God.
Does Sam know about this?

03:53.033 --> 03:54.666
Not yet.

03:54.701 --> 03:55.667
Tahir?

03:55.702 --> 03:57.302
It looks that way.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.471
Why would he do
something like this?

03:59.506 --> 04:00.639
To torture Sam.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.274
I'm gonna go see
if I can find 'em.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.413
Hey, when do we get to cry?

04:08.448 --> 04:10.582
We get to do that
when the job is done,

04:10.617 --> 04:12.618
when the bad guys are dead.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.530
You think this imam knows
where Tahir is?

04:25.565 --> 04:28.033
No, but I'm gonna
talk to him anyway.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.467
Stay here.
Why?

04:29.502 --> 04:31.036
It's just better if you do.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.071
We're going to see my rabbi,
I'd take you with me.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.739
You're not Jewish.

04:34.774 --> 04:35.740
I'd still bring you inside.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.908
I'll be right back.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.944
Don't change the radio stations.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.750
(call to prayer playing
over speakers)

05:03.937 --> 05:06.671
All right, Callen and Sam
are on Fairfax.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.040
Callen's in the car,
and Sam's in a mosque.

05:09.075 --> 05:10.775
Maybe he's reaching
out to the imam

05:10.810 --> 05:12.410
for some spiritual
guidance, comfort.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.045
Or maybe he's holding
somebody's feet

05:14.080 --> 05:15.947
over the fire to find Tahir.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.983
Let's get Callen on the horn.
Yeah.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.019
(phone rings)

05:22.088 --> 05:24.055
What do you got, Eric?

05:24.090 --> 05:26.991
Callen, Tahir hijacked
the coroner's van

05:27.026 --> 05:28.393
that was carrying
Michelle's body.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.628
Son of a bitch.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.897
We're trying to find the van,
but so far no luck.

05:32.932 --> 05:33.998
How is Sam?

05:34.033 --> 05:36.668
Focused, but I tell him this,
he's gonna lose it.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.670
Hey, guys,
I think I've got something.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.905
So, I was finally
able to track down

05:40.940 --> 05:44.576
the portable refrigerator rental
where Michelle was... found.

05:44.611 --> 05:48.146
Um, it was leased by a company
called Media Advert Holdings.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.515
I can't find the actual owner,
but it looks like

05:50.550 --> 05:52.050
there's a business address
in Mar Vista.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.052
Good work, Nell.
Send it to us. We're on it.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.554
Hold on a second. Kensi and I
should check that out.

05:56.589 --> 05:57.722
Why?

05:57.757 --> 05:58.790
Because that's
an amateur mistake,

05:58.825 --> 06:00.992
and Tahir is not an amateur.
He's too smart for that.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.461
If Tahir were smart,
he'd get the hell out of Dodge.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.064
If Tahir were smart, he wouldn't
have killed Michelle and then

06:06.099 --> 06:07.499
taken her body.
I understand that.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.033
What I'm saying is,
it could be a trap.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.702
Tahir does not know
what Kensi and I look like,

06:10.737 --> 06:11.903
which means we can get

06:11.938 --> 06:13.638
in there
without tipping him off.

06:13.673 --> 06:16.174
Okay, but be careful.
Sam and I'll back you up.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.041
We're on it.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.478
(call to prayer playing
over speakers)

06:21.014 --> 06:22.981
(speaking indistinctly)

06:23.016 --> 06:24.015
Excuse me.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.452
May I help you?

06:27.487 --> 06:29.120
I'm looking
for my friend. Sam Hanna?

06:29.155 --> 06:31.856
You are Callen?

06:31.891 --> 06:34.459
Yes.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.829
Osama asked me
to give you this.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.522
Eric, it's Callen.
Do you have Sam's location?

07:04.557 --> 07:05.023
He's not with you?

07:05.058 --> 07:06.191
He's not now.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.592
Where'd he go?

07:07.627 --> 07:08.660
I don't know.
Look, do you have it or not?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.061
Uh, I had him a minute ago.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.530
He was inside the mosque.

07:12.565 --> 07:13.765
His phone's no longer on line.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.500
Can you bring it back on line?

07:15.535 --> 07:17.502
Yeah, as long as it's got power.

07:17.537 --> 07:18.770
Well?

07:18.805 --> 07:20.772
Eric?!

07:20.807 --> 07:22.674
It's not responding.
Is everything okay?

07:22.709 --> 07:25.777
No. Look, keep trying
to locate him.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.679
What's the update
on the coroner's van?

07:27.714 --> 07:29.214
Um, still looking.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.315
Keep me posted.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.618
Tell Kensi and Deeks
to sit tight until I get there.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.153
(car engine starts)

07:35.188 --> 07:36.588
(tires screech)

08:06.719 --> 08:08.720
¶ ¶

08:23.636 --> 08:26.170
You ready?

08:26.205 --> 08:27.672
I am now.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.729
Eh, doesn't look
like anybody's inside.

08:51.764 --> 08:54.666
No sign of Tahir or anything
out of the ordinary.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.000
Where's Callen?

08:56.035 --> 08:56.901
He's not here yet.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.037
Told us to sit tight
until he gets here.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.338
Yeah, but the clock
is ticking.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.674
Mm. Could still be a trap.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.075
Could be nothing.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.711
Better to wait
for backup.

09:06.746 --> 09:09.080
What would Sam do?

09:10.216 --> 09:12.217
Sam?

09:13.219 --> 09:15.253
Sam?

09:25.932 --> 09:27.899
(line ringing)

09:27.934 --> 09:29.701
This is Sam.
Leave a message.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.637
You need to call me back
right now. This is not cool.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.706
Look, you try
and do this on your own,

09:34.741 --> 09:36.240
you're playing
right into Tahir's hand.

09:36.275 --> 09:39.377
Now, we will get this guy,
but we have to do it right.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.846
And, yeah,
I do realize the irony

09:41.881 --> 09:44.583
of me telling you
to drop the lone wolf crap.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.953
(sighs)

10:00.366 --> 10:01.766
Clear.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.201
Clear.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.303
Well, this is
definitely not a trap.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.938
It's more like a dead end.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.640
I'm not so sure about that.

10:08.675 --> 10:11.809
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.177
Those were taken after
Michelle was kidnapped.

10:13.212 --> 10:17.815
Yeah, Tahir wanted Sam
to find them, torment him more.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.151
Man, he's going to hell.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.253
Sam's gonna make sure of it,

10:22.288 --> 10:25.790
even if he takes him there
himself.

10:31.731 --> 10:34.332
(footfalls approaching)

10:34.367 --> 10:37.001
Ms. Jones?

10:37.036 --> 10:42.774
Um, Sam gave Callen the slip
and headed out on his own.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.743
Mm. Well...

10:45.778 --> 10:48.179
that's inevitable.

10:48.214 --> 10:51.049
I don't suppose
you hid a tracker, or used

10:51.084 --> 10:54.018
some overwatch?

10:54.053 --> 10:57.088
No? So we have no idea
where he's going?

10:57.123 --> 10:59.124
Well, he's going to...

11:00.760 --> 11:04.128
...kill the man
who murdered his wife.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.698
Find Tahir

11:06.733 --> 11:09.934
and you'll find Agent Hanna.

11:09.969 --> 11:13.405
Let's pray we find him first.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.942
It's a list of all the guys
being monitored in this area.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.779
How many are we talking?

11:21.814 --> 11:23.881
Way too many.

11:23.916 --> 11:25.883
But I highlighted those the NSA

11:25.918 --> 11:28.886
has tagged with
extra chatter recently.

11:28.921 --> 11:30.755
Recognize anyone?

11:34.527 --> 11:35.927
I don't know.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.969
Maybe Aimon Shah.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.771
Recognize his name.

11:46.806 --> 11:48.773
Kuwaiti.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.842
Came here with about a hundred
million of daddy's oil money.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.911
Spent most of it
on cars and houses

11:53.946 --> 11:55.980
and a bunch
of failed businesses,

11:56.015 --> 11:58.916
till they miraculously
turned around.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.318
Money laundering?

12:00.353 --> 12:02.787
Yeah. He's been working with
a bunch of Middle Eastern

12:02.822 --> 12:04.789
and North African
criminal organizations.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.491
Only reason why feds
haven't shut him down

12:06.526 --> 12:08.926
is because he's providing them
with a wealth of information

12:08.961 --> 12:11.829
on the financial structure
of those groups.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.865
He just doesn't know it.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.867
Well, Tahir's obviously
getting help.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.969
Somebody's got to be
bankrolling him.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.371
Yeah, it could be Aimon Shah.

12:20.406 --> 12:24.509
And even if he isn't helping
Tahir, he probably knows who is.

12:27.146 --> 12:29.414
This is all because
of his sister?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.785
What do you think?

12:34.887 --> 12:38.422
Well, what I think is, this guy
Tahir truly hates you.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.424
I'm just trying to find out why.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.893
What difference does it make?

12:41.928 --> 12:43.561
Well, if you figure out
what makes a guy tick,

12:43.596 --> 12:45.163
you might figure out a way
to beat him.

12:46.999 --> 12:48.533
His sister Jada's
still in Sudan.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.169
We got people on the ground
over there.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.238
We could... we could grab her,
maybe.

12:54.273 --> 12:57.041
Tahir would gladly
kill his sister.

12:57.076 --> 13:00.044
Because he knows it would hurt
me more than it would hurt him.

13:04.050 --> 13:07.084
I've never even met this guy
and I want him dead.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.519
Yeah.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.989
Well, get in line.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.894
Kens?
KENSI: In here.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.830
Thought I told you
to wait for me.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.131
DEEKS:
That's on me.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.532
I figured the sooner
we move, the better.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.501
KENSI:
Wait. Where's Sam?

13:23.536 --> 13:27.038
He bugged out,
loaded up on weapons.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.105
Why would he try
to do this on his own?

13:28.140 --> 13:29.340
Men are stupid that way.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.176
I think he was trying
to protect...

13:32.211 --> 13:33.511
Take them down.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.979
It's evidence, Callen.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.347
I don't care if it's evidence,
we have enough.

13:36.382 --> 13:38.316
Yeah, but there could
be fingerprints.
I don't want Sam to see it.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.451
We could figure
out who took...
Take it down!

13:40.486 --> 13:41.920
All right.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.459
Get down!

13:48.494 --> 13:50.161
(screams)

13:50.196 --> 13:52.363
Down. Sniper!
(groaning)

13:52.398 --> 13:53.497
Aah!

13:53.532 --> 13:55.466
Hold on, you're okay.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.068
You're okay, slug got the vest.
You're all right.

13:57.103 --> 13:57.969
It doesn't feel like it.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.007
Aah!
Ah, son of a bitch.

14:03.042 --> 14:03.942
Definitely
still there.

14:19.492 --> 14:23.594
(taps ambulance, siren wails)

14:23.629 --> 14:27.031
I cannot wait for
this day to be over.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.499
Me, too.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.067
You find anything?

14:30.102 --> 14:32.003
Uh, no eyewitnesses.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.005
Shooter took all their brass,
wiped everything down.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.907
Trying to get surveillance
footage from the building

14:35.942 --> 14:37.408
to Eric, maybe
we'll get lucky.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.377
Think they're
watching us?

14:39.412 --> 14:41.145
I hope so.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.885
(siren wailing)

14:50.289 --> 14:51.289
Thanks.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.056
How you feeling?

14:53.092 --> 14:55.126
Oh, like I got hit
by a baseball bat.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.061
(scoffs)
You wish.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.130
Okay, you can, uh, drop
us off on Ocean View.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.032
He needs to go to the hospital.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.066
My tetanus
is up to date.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.668
Yeah, and I just dewormed him.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.636
EMT:
He still needs to be
looked at by a physician.

15:05.671 --> 15:08.139
Look, he's been shot
before, but for real.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.607
Five times to be exact.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.642
Closing in on Suge and Fiddy.

15:11.677 --> 15:13.044
(chuckling)
Almost there.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.579
Mm-hmm.

15:15.614 --> 15:16.648
Mr. Beale.

15:19.018 --> 15:21.218
Uh... (clears throat)
you scared me.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.321
(chuckles)

15:23.356 --> 15:25.256
I'm sorry.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.491
Give me some
good news.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.727
Good news, um...

15:29.762 --> 15:32.363
Callen's injuries
are minor.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.065
Other than that,

15:34.100 --> 15:36.000
still looking for the
coroner's vehicle.

15:36.035 --> 15:40.137
The black van that was used
to abduct Michelle is stolen,

15:40.172 --> 15:42.239
so no leads there.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.674
Um, the...
(clears throat)

15:43.709 --> 15:46.010
the two men who were
killed in the warehouse

15:46.045 --> 15:48.312
where Sam's wife
was murdered,

15:48.347 --> 15:51.682
uh, they're Sudanese nationals
that came over in January.

15:51.717 --> 15:55.119
Um, they're both former
soldiers, served with Tahir.

15:55.154 --> 15:59.056
The security guard,
he had a criminal record,

15:59.091 --> 16:01.125
so no way he was legit.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.094
Probably a local gun for hire.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.429
The Corollas had no plates,

16:05.464 --> 16:07.365
so they could've been
purchased, stolen,

16:07.400 --> 16:09.100
rented, who knows.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.434
And here's a fun fact:

16:10.469 --> 16:12.370
the Corolla is
a popular car

16:12.405 --> 16:13.771
in all of Los Angeles.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.740
There are literally
thousands to run down.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.241
(sighs)

16:17.276 --> 16:20.444
What about the money
that went to, uh, Zhrov?

16:20.479 --> 16:22.313
Ah, that originated overseas.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.448
I'm still trying to source that.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.084
I'm sorry, did you
only want good news?

16:27.119 --> 16:28.686
'Cause some of that
was bad news.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.121
Actually, most of that
was bad news.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.556
Actually... all of that
was bad news.

16:32.591 --> 16:34.792
Actually, I...

16:34.827 --> 16:38.329
had started to think
we were through the worst of it.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.734
But now... this.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.437
It's always darkest
before the dawn.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.606
Or the next tornado.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.508
(computer beeps)

16:50.543 --> 16:53.210
Hey, I got a hit
on the coroner's van.

16:53.245 --> 16:54.278
It's in a lot off Centinela.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.215
Good news.
(chuckles)

16:58.250 --> 17:00.251
¶ ¶

17:05.224 --> 17:07.591
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
we're not open.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.560
Hmm, well, you seem
pretty open to me.

17:09.595 --> 17:12.229
Only to private members
at this time.

17:12.264 --> 17:13.598
Yeah, we're here to see Aimon.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.200
(speaking Arabic)

17:20.206 --> 17:21.239
I'm sorry,
Mr. Shah's not here.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.219
You're clean. Go.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.562
How can I help you gentlemen?

17:44.597 --> 17:47.165
We're looking for a man
named Tahir Khaled.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.435
I don't know anyone
by that name.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.178
Who is he?

18:03.215 --> 18:04.715
A Sudanese war criminal.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.749
(soft chuckle)

18:05.784 --> 18:08.886
In this country?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.688
That's unfortunate.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.324
Um, but why do you think
I know this guy?

18:13.359 --> 18:14.625
The "criminal" part.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.660
(soft chuckle)

18:17.329 --> 18:18.729
Your friend, he insults me.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.465
Who says he's my friend?

18:24.203 --> 18:26.403
SABATINO:
You boys seem pretty jumpy.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.306
Might want to
cut back on the tea.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.478
What's that?

18:34.513 --> 18:35.312
Oh, that?

18:35.347 --> 18:38.282
That is a transcript
of conversations

18:38.317 --> 18:41.385
and e-mails that tie you to a
bunch of criminal organizations.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.387
SAM:
You know...

18:44.490 --> 18:47.825
these are trying times
for Muslims in this country.

18:50.262 --> 18:52.863
Especially those involved
in illegal activity.

18:52.898 --> 18:55.332
I suggest you
and your non-friend leave

18:55.367 --> 18:56.734
before I call the police.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.235
I'm a federal agent.

18:58.270 --> 19:01.805
And yet, I have seen

19:01.840 --> 19:04.208
no identification,

19:04.243 --> 19:06.777
no badges, guys, uh,
not even a warrant.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.848
All I see is two men who have
come into my place of business

19:10.883 --> 19:12.283
to harass me with...

19:14.420 --> 19:16.521
what I can only assume
are phony documents.

19:23.829 --> 19:24.795
Get rid of them.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.931
(men grunting)

19:31.237 --> 19:32.236
(groans)

19:35.474 --> 19:36.507
SAM:
Listen to me,

19:36.542 --> 19:39.376
Tahir Khaled murdered my wife.

19:39.411 --> 19:40.511
You understand me?

19:40.546 --> 19:42.980
Now, there's two sides to this:

19:43.015 --> 19:44.982
you can either help me,

19:45.017 --> 19:46.550
or help him.

19:46.585 --> 19:48.385
He's working with
the Ethiopians!

19:48.420 --> 19:49.620
It's a big country.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.222
Give me a name.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.356
Edward Kebede.

19:53.392 --> 19:54.725
(grunts, thuds)

19:56.428 --> 19:58.362
SABATINO:
Just so we're clear,

19:58.397 --> 20:01.332
this is not a safe alternative
to smoking, boys.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.716
Here you go.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.563
It's clear.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.531
Van's empty.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.767
No body, no explosives,
no explosive devices.

20:36.802 --> 20:38.703
(phone ringing)

20:40.439 --> 20:42.506
Yeah.
Deeks...

20:42.541 --> 20:43.607
Deeks, wait, it could be a trap.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.442
They obviously know
when to call.

20:45.477 --> 20:47.645
They're watching us.
All right, then shoot them
when they shoot me.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.046
Tahir obviously wants to talk,

20:49.081 --> 20:50.781
otherwise why would he
bother with a phone?

20:50.816 --> 20:52.383
No, Deeks, wait, it
could be another trap.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.617
Get Beale to trace it.

20:53.652 --> 20:54.719
On it.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.988
Hello.
Who is this?

20:58.023 --> 20:59.590
This is LAPD Detective
Marty Deeks.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.493
I'm guessing this is Tahir?

21:02.528 --> 21:04.561
Eric, trace the call, he's
on the phone with Tahir.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.562
Way ahead of you.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.031
Where is Sam Hanna?

21:07.066 --> 21:08.565
I have no idea.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.800
I assumed he was with you.

21:09.835 --> 21:12.303
I have his wife.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.371
Oh, well, that is unfortunate
'cause you'd be better off

21:14.406 --> 21:15.605
with a live hand grenade
in your mouth.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.575
Actually, I wish you had a live
hand grenade in your mouth.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.511
Which begs the question
to be asked,

21:20.546 --> 21:21.945
you don't perchance have

21:21.980 --> 21:23.647
a live hand grenade just sitting
around at the house?

21:23.682 --> 21:26.083
'Cause if you did, and you could
put that in your mouth,

21:26.118 --> 21:27.651
that would be fantastic.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.386
Eric, come on,
you got him or what?

21:29.421 --> 21:30.387
Not yet.

21:30.422 --> 21:34.391
TAHIR: I need Sam Hanna
to come out of hiding.

21:34.426 --> 21:38.495
Oh, see, Sam Hanna
is not in hiding, he's hunting.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.864
And to clarify,
he's hunting you.

21:40.899 --> 21:43.567
I mean, you get that, right?

21:43.602 --> 21:47.871
Oh, I also forgot to say that,
as a law enforcement officer,

21:47.906 --> 21:50.541
it is my ethical duty to tell
you that you need to surrender

21:50.576 --> 21:51.642
and turn yourself in.

21:52.678 --> 21:55.446
That is not going to happen.

21:55.481 --> 21:56.547
Good.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.615
I was hoping you would say that.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.952
You have two minutes
to get Sam Hanna.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.088
Just to clarify,
'cause this is driving me crazy,

22:04.123 --> 22:05.522
you do realize
it's two words, right?

22:05.557 --> 22:07.591
First name "Sam,"
last name "Hanna."

22:07.626 --> 22:09.493
It sounds like "Sam Hanna."

22:09.528 --> 22:11.528
It's not "Samhanna,"
like Sumatra.

22:11.563 --> 22:16.433
You now have...
less than two minutes.

22:16.468 --> 22:18.102
Okay, hold on a second, hold on
a second. So, wait, let's say,

22:18.137 --> 22:19.270
for instance,
worst-case scenario,

22:19.305 --> 22:22.673
I don't find Sam. Is there
a number that I can have him

22:22.708 --> 22:24.541
call you back at?
Do you have, like,

22:24.576 --> 22:25.676
a pager or something?

22:25.711 --> 22:28.579
If you can't find him...

22:28.614 --> 22:32.483
then I will send his wife
back to him...

22:32.518 --> 22:35.653
piece by piece.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.825
Tahir? Tahir?

22:41.860 --> 22:43.861
Eric, please tell me
you have him.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.663
Beale!

22:47.433 --> 22:48.532
No.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.568
Damn it!

23:02.881 --> 23:03.947
We have any idea
where Sam is?

23:03.982 --> 23:06.417
No, but Tahir's calling
back in about 30 seconds.

23:06.452 --> 23:07.785
Okay, so what am I doing?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.553
We don't need Sam
if we can voice synth

23:09.588 --> 23:11.555
enough dialogue to fool Tahir.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.557
Deeks, plug that phone
into the Audi's tablet.

23:13.592 --> 23:14.625
Okay,

23:14.660 --> 23:16.693
I'll bring up Sam's voice mail,

23:16.728 --> 23:19.130
start scrubbing through
for mission recordings.

23:20.599 --> 23:23.667
Okay, you know what, uh,
I don't have an adaptor.

23:23.702 --> 23:24.735
(sighs)
It should be
in your kit.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.637
Yeah, I'm not exactly sure
what you guys are doing,

23:26.672 --> 23:27.938
but whatever it is,
you need to hurry.

23:27.973 --> 23:30.707
Come on, Deeks.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.910
Trying.

23:32.945 --> 23:36.680
SAM (over computer):
This is Sam, leave a message.

23:36.715 --> 23:38.015
This is Sam.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.550
They don't have it.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.118
Eric, sending to you now.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.619
(phone rings)

23:42.654 --> 23:45.622
Geez.
Damn it.

23:45.657 --> 23:46.957
Guys, what am I doing?

23:46.992 --> 23:49.693
I got it.
I got the adapter.

23:49.728 --> 23:50.661
Nell?

23:50.696 --> 23:52.463
I really need some more time
for the rest.

23:52.498 --> 23:53.664
We don't have time.

23:53.699 --> 23:55.732
SAM'S VOICE (on computer):
You have Eric send the address.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.100
We got to pick up, we got
to pick up, hurry up.

23:57.135 --> 23:58.535
Eric?
No.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.070
Guys!
Okay, go for it, Eric.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.939
Here goes nothing.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.040
SAM'S VOICE:
This is Sam.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.741
TAHIR:
I was afraid you was

24:04.776 --> 24:06.210
avoiding me.

24:07.579 --> 24:08.645
Here you go.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.614
SAM'S VOICE:
What do you what?

24:10.649 --> 24:13.750
I have your wife.

24:13.785 --> 24:17.721
I'm holding her wedding ring

24:17.756 --> 24:20.757
right now.

24:20.792 --> 24:21.792
I'm surprised she agreed

24:21.827 --> 24:23.594
to marry you.

24:23.629 --> 24:26.063
My grandmother has
more gold in her teeth.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.798
What do you got?

24:27.833 --> 24:29.199
I'm still looking.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.201
Eric, play that line again.

24:31.236 --> 24:32.870
SAM'S VOICE:
What do you want?

24:32.905 --> 24:35.672
TAHIR:
I want to see you.

24:35.707 --> 24:38.108
Be at the corner
of Hollywood and Highland

24:38.143 --> 24:39.943
in 30 minutes.

24:39.978 --> 24:43.580
Come alone...

24:43.615 --> 24:47.685
or I will send your wife
back to you in pieces.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.656
Starting with her head.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.796
What the hell
do we do now?

25:00.766 --> 25:02.800
We find Sam.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.994
Couldn't get a look inside,

25:31.029 --> 25:32.262
but there are
two guys out front,

25:32.297 --> 25:33.931
probably lookouts.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.566
I'm sure Aimon
tipped 'em off we're coming.

25:35.601 --> 25:38.735
No doubt.

25:38.770 --> 25:41.672
If, uh, Tahir
was here, well...

25:42.674 --> 25:44.708
...he may have
already split.

25:45.811 --> 25:47.912
Or he's waiting inside
for me.

25:51.917 --> 25:54.985
Thanks for letting me
help you out.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.787
Although I know
I'm only here

25:56.822 --> 25:58.822
to protect Callen
and the rest of your team

25:58.857 --> 26:00.924
because you think
I'm expendable, but...

26:00.959 --> 26:03.894
We're all expendable,
Sabatino.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.801
I loved your wife, Sam.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.870
Are you done talking?
Yeah.

26:20.779 --> 26:22.879
(sighs)

26:22.914 --> 26:24.214
Bring any extra cuffs?

26:24.249 --> 26:26.683
Uh, yeah.

26:26.718 --> 26:28.285
Thanks.

26:31.657 --> 26:32.956
Sorry, man.

26:32.991 --> 26:36.026
I'm the only one that's
expendable around here.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.648
(starts engine)

26:57.683 --> 26:59.683
(tires screech)

27:01.887 --> 27:03.754
(groans)

27:03.789 --> 27:05.723
What?

27:07.292 --> 27:08.892
Seriously?

27:08.927 --> 27:10.894
(groaning)

27:13.732 --> 27:15.766
(phone ringing)
Sam hasn't used
any credit cards

27:15.801 --> 27:17.134
or done anything to
allow us to track him.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.301
Of course he hasn't.
Hello.

27:18.336 --> 27:20.737
Callen. Sabatino.

27:20.772 --> 27:22.205
I was just with Sam
in Little Ethiopia.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.274
He's about to walk
into a gunfight alone.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.141
Send me the address.

27:25.177 --> 27:28.145
How about I just
tell you the address?

27:28.180 --> 27:30.080
Sam's in Little Ethiopia
with Sabatino.

27:30.115 --> 27:31.014
He just gave him
the slip as well.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.684
I'll have Kensi and Deeks
meet us there.

28:03.215 --> 28:06.784
¶ ¶

28:33.011 --> 28:36.914
¶ ¶

28:41.253 --> 28:42.886
(groaning)

28:42.921 --> 28:45.122
(sirens approaching)

28:53.799 --> 28:55.532
Sam.
Hey.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.200
Sam, hold on. Sam.
Where you going?

28:57.235 --> 28:59.402
Sam, stop.
Sam, what are you doing?

28:59.437 --> 29:00.871
Sam, listen...
(engine starts)

29:16.221 --> 29:17.320
Get out of my way.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.790
Tahir contacted us.
Where is he?

29:19.825 --> 29:20.957
Come with me,
I'll take you there.

29:20.992 --> 29:22.292
Don't play me, G.
I'm not playing you,

29:22.327 --> 29:23.426
but we have to hurry.

29:23.461 --> 29:24.961
Tell me where he is.

29:24.996 --> 29:26.997
Not unless you promise
to do this with me.

29:27.032 --> 29:27.798
It's not about you.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.533
If it's about you,
it's about me

29:29.568 --> 29:30.934
and everyone else
on this team.

29:30.969 --> 29:32.536
Tell me where he is!

29:32.571 --> 29:33.804
Sam.

29:36.541 --> 29:37.941
You gonna shoot me now?

29:37.976 --> 29:40.177
Please just let us help you.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.412
KENSI:
Sam, please.

29:42.447 --> 29:43.880
Please.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.949
Tahir has Michelle's body.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.884
They hijacked the coroner's
van, he's gonna meet you

29:47.919 --> 29:49.453
at the corner of Hollywood
and Highland in ten minutes.

29:57.229 --> 29:58.295
You coming or not?

30:01.333 --> 30:03.300
(car door closes, engine starts)

30:27.425 --> 30:30.027
Oh, yeah, sure, man.
(chuckles)

30:39.671 --> 30:42.205
You guys in place?

30:42.240 --> 30:45.408
In position.

30:45.443 --> 30:47.845
I got eyes on Sam.

30:49.147 --> 30:50.580
Nell?
Yep.

30:50.615 --> 30:51.681
CALLEN (over radio):
Deeks?

30:51.716 --> 30:54.384
Well, the good news is,
is Jesus is always with you.

30:54.419 --> 30:55.652
Oh, how comforting.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.454
CALLEN:
Anyone have eyes on Tahir?

30:57.489 --> 30:58.655
Not me.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.457
Nope.
Eric?

31:00.492 --> 31:02.459
I'm looking.
Don't see anything yet.

31:02.494 --> 31:03.660
You think he made us?

31:03.695 --> 31:05.495
I don't know.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.998
Can still be playing.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.432
He wants us antsy.

31:09.467 --> 31:11.635
There's a better chance
we'll do something impulsive.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.238
I'm gonna impulsive his skull
into dust.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.914
Guys, I might have something.

31:23.949 --> 31:26.182
Gray and black striped
hoodie, sunglasses.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.151
20 yards north of Deeks,
walking towards you.

31:28.186 --> 31:30.287
Yeah, I see him.
Is that Tahir?

31:30.322 --> 31:32.155
Eric?
Uh, I'm running
facial rec,

31:32.190 --> 31:34.324
but not enough reference
points to confirm.

31:34.359 --> 31:35.325
He's the right size.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.193
Guys, tell me something.
Do I take him or not?

31:37.228 --> 31:38.194
Deeks.

31:38.229 --> 31:40.630
I got this.

31:40.665 --> 31:43.066
Afternoon, son.
How are you, sir?

31:43.101 --> 31:45.602
That's not him.
I repeat, that's not Tahir.

31:45.637 --> 31:48.338
It's just another
angry Angeleno.

31:48.373 --> 31:51.208
DEEKS: It's not my fault
they canceled<i> Portlandia.</i>

32:08.226 --> 32:10.226
Mr. Hanna.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.362
Please, get in.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.435
Sam's getting on the tour bus.

32:20.572 --> 32:24.174
Please, have a seat
in the back.

32:26.511 --> 32:28.445
Tahir must be on the bus.
Anyone have eyes on him?

32:28.480 --> 32:29.612
Yeah, he's near the back,

32:29.647 --> 32:31.481
but we got civilians
on there, too.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.183
Kens, you got a shot?

32:33.218 --> 32:34.317
I don't, I'm blocked.

32:34.352 --> 32:36.119
Eric, do not lose that bus.

32:36.154 --> 32:37.487
Not a chance.

32:37.522 --> 32:39.323
I'll follow with Nell.

32:44.763 --> 32:48.131
I saved you a seat, Sam Hanna.

32:55.407 --> 32:58.575
Now, I suggest

32:58.610 --> 33:02.779
you refrain
from any attempt

33:02.814 --> 33:04.781
at heroism,

33:04.816 --> 33:06.383
or my colleagues on board

33:06.418 --> 33:08.618
will start shooting
the other passengers.

33:14.426 --> 33:15.692
Now give me your hand.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.462
I have something for you.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.647
I don't want you running away.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.450
Oh, you're not that lucky.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.318
Tell me we have a plan.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.821
We need to separate Tahir
and Sam from the passengers.

33:44.856 --> 33:49.292
And just how do you plan
on doing that, Mr. Callen?

33:49.327 --> 33:51.328
I'm working on that.

33:53.131 --> 33:54.464
Where's my wife?

33:54.499 --> 33:57.834
You'll be with her soon enough.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.769
Where we going with this, Tahir?

33:59.804 --> 34:02.772
You got me here, I'm all alone.

34:02.807 --> 34:04.474
Let the rest
of these people off.

34:06.511 --> 34:08.478
I can't do that.

34:08.513 --> 34:09.412
Why not?

34:09.447 --> 34:11.848
Well, they provide me

34:11.883 --> 34:16.653
with a certain level
of protection, leverage.

34:16.688 --> 34:19.823
What'd you do with the driver?

34:19.858 --> 34:22.258
He is not your concern.

34:22.293 --> 34:25.361
Did you guys hear that?
The driver is one of Tahir's.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.297
Well, take him out.

34:27.332 --> 34:28.431
The driver's a woman.

34:28.466 --> 34:31.668
I stand corrected, take<i> her</i> out.

34:31.703 --> 34:32.702
Copy that.

34:32.737 --> 34:33.803
Put us alongside the tour bus,

34:33.838 --> 34:34.838
I'll take the driver.

34:34.873 --> 34:36.272
Nell, where are you and Deeks?

34:36.307 --> 34:37.640
NELL:
We are right behind you.

34:37.675 --> 34:39.142
CALLEN:<i> Think you can get in</i>
<i> front of this bus and stop it?</i>

34:39.177 --> 34:41.344
Oh, hell yeah.
Watch this, hang on.

34:41.379 --> 34:42.445
I knew I should have driven.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.280
Deeks, Jesus is my co-pilot!

34:44.315 --> 34:45.748
Okay, that's, it's not true.

34:45.783 --> 34:47.383
Don't be a coward
and hide behind

34:47.418 --> 34:48.585
all these innocent people.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.820
(laughs)

34:50.855 --> 34:54.524
You don't have much time left,
Sam Hanna.

34:54.559 --> 34:57.861
I wouldn't waste it.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.465
You know my name is Sam Hanna.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.134
It's two words.

35:04.169 --> 35:05.836
Even your sister knows that.

35:10.475 --> 35:12.175
(horn honking)

35:13.845 --> 35:15.211
Get ready, Sam.

35:15.246 --> 35:16.513
On three.

35:16.548 --> 35:17.614
One.

35:17.649 --> 35:18.648
Move!
Really?

35:18.683 --> 35:19.716
KENSI:
Two.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.384
Three. Hey!

35:22.720 --> 35:25.688
(people screaming)

35:25.723 --> 35:26.890
(gunshot)

35:30.762 --> 35:32.662
Everybody off the bus, now!
Go, go!

35:32.697 --> 35:34.264
CALLEN:
Sam?

35:36.234 --> 35:37.567
Go, let's go, let's go,
come on, guys.

35:37.602 --> 35:38.535
Let's go.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.203
Where is she?

35:40.238 --> 35:42.405
(laughs)
Where is she?

35:42.440 --> 35:44.274
Is this what you're looking for?

35:44.309 --> 35:45.642
G, get off the bus.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.744
What?
He's got a suicide vest.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.746
Can you disarm it?
No.

35:49.781 --> 35:52.715
Kensi, Deeks, evacuate the area!

35:52.750 --> 35:53.883
Get back! Get back, everybody.

35:53.918 --> 35:54.918
Back, you guys.
Now, go!

35:54.953 --> 35:56.252
Everybody back.

35:56.287 --> 35:57.587
Behind the car, everybody back.

35:57.622 --> 35:59.189
Get back, as far as you can.

35:59.224 --> 36:01.424
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

36:01.459 --> 36:03.726
And that is your
weakness, Sam Hanna.

36:03.761 --> 36:06.829
Your mercy is what killed
your wife.

36:06.864 --> 36:08.298
(groans)

36:08.333 --> 36:09.799
I won't make that mistake again.

36:11.769 --> 36:13.503
(screaming)

36:14.572 --> 36:15.838
SAM:
G!

36:15.873 --> 36:17.507
DEEKS:
Callen?

36:17.542 --> 36:18.909
Sam!

36:20.845 --> 36:22.646
(grunting)

36:36.494 --> 36:38.628
(car alarm wailing)

36:38.663 --> 36:40.664
Son of a bitch.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.968
KENSI (muffled):
Guys, you okay?

36:45.003 --> 36:47.837
Here, I got you.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.472
You okay?
You all right?
Yeah.

36:49.507 --> 36:51.541
Think so.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.460
I need a drink.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.695
(sniffles)

37:12.730 --> 37:15.665
(exhales)

37:15.700 --> 37:18.768
Mr. Beale, come on.
You're gonna pour.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.710
(mouths)

37:27.712 --> 37:29.713
Thanks.

37:33.651 --> 37:35.418
Hey.

37:35.453 --> 37:38.821
So, Michelle's body
was recovered by LAPD.

37:38.856 --> 37:40.790
Uh, they found it in a van

37:40.825 --> 37:43.893
left where the tour bus
was hijacked.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.496
They're personally escorting it
to the morgue now.

37:46.531 --> 37:48.331
Callen's taking Sam there.

37:48.366 --> 37:49.766
Good. Okay.
Yeah.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.567
Um...
Yeah.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.336
...and Sabatino?

37:53.371 --> 37:55.505
Sam cuffed him
in an alleyway.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.540
Maybe that's an oops.
I-I don't...

37:57.575 --> 37:59.008
Ooh.
Yeah.

37:59.043 --> 38:02.545
Well, he probably escaped,
I mean, he's good at that stuff.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.013
Yeah.

38:04.048 --> 38:06.683
Anything else? Are you okay?

38:07.719 --> 38:09.552
No.

38:09.587 --> 38:12.422
I just...

38:12.457 --> 38:15.625
I feel so badly for Sam.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.295
I can't imagine losing someone
that close to you.

38:22.667 --> 38:25.468
Came through straight around
here, we cut him off.

38:27.505 --> 38:30.106
Neither can I.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.675
Um, will you excuse me
for a second?

38:32.710 --> 38:34.010
Course.

38:35.413 --> 38:36.612
Hey, Tony?

38:36.647 --> 38:37.714
Yeah.

38:37.749 --> 38:38.915
Can I borrow that flashbang?

38:38.950 --> 38:40.583
Uh, yeah, I guess.

38:40.618 --> 38:41.785
What for?

38:42.820 --> 38:45.021
Surprise.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.728
Banging.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.596
Deeks, can I talk to you
for a sec?

38:53.631 --> 38:55.365
Yeah.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.766
The hell was that?

38:56.801 --> 38:59.102
Um, a, um...
(clears throat)

38:59.137 --> 39:00.770
Sorry, could you just
give me a hand.

39:00.805 --> 39:01.805
What?

39:03.574 --> 39:05.408
Whoa, no.
Martin Deeks, will you marry me?

39:05.443 --> 39:06.676
No, no, co-- baby,
you got to stand up.

39:06.711 --> 39:08.411
No, Deeks, no.
Get up, get up...

39:08.446 --> 39:10.980
Listen, you can't. You can't,
you can't, you can't do this.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.115
Deeks, I think I just did.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.850
No, but you can't,
because, y-you...

39:13.885 --> 39:16.686
the guy, the guy has to,
the guy has to propose.

39:16.721 --> 39:19.122
Oh, really?
'Cause I think it's 2017.

39:19.157 --> 39:21.391
And you kind of had your shot.

39:21.426 --> 39:23.493
Not to be a stickler for detail,

39:23.528 --> 39:25.061
but I've actually proposed
three times,

39:25.096 --> 39:27.163
if you count
the very romantic version I did

39:27.198 --> 39:28.564
while you were in a coma.

39:28.599 --> 39:31.768
Baby, what are
you doing?

39:31.803 --> 39:34.771
¶ These dreams
we're holding... ¶

39:34.806 --> 39:37.740
Life is really short, Deeks.

39:37.775 --> 39:40.643
I mean, we saw that today,
and we see it every day.

39:40.678 --> 39:43.646
¶ All the world is
ours to take... ¶

39:43.681 --> 39:46.115
And I don't know how much time
either one of us has left,

39:46.150 --> 39:48.885
but I do know this:

39:48.920 --> 39:52.755
I want to spend the rest
of what I have with you.

39:52.790 --> 39:54.924
¶<i> Ooh...</i> ¶

39:54.959 --> 39:57.693
So what's it gonna be?

39:57.728 --> 39:59.829
¶<i> Ooh...</i> ¶

39:59.864 --> 40:01.697
I mean, I don't know,
I mean, this is...

40:01.732 --> 40:03.166
(sniffles)

40:03.201 --> 40:05.935
...it's a lot
for a girl to process.

40:05.970 --> 40:08.871
(laughing):
You're such an idiot.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.707
I love you.

40:11.742 --> 40:14.544
¶ A chance to discover... ¶

40:14.579 --> 40:16.612
I love you.

40:16.647 --> 40:18.648
Yes.

40:18.683 --> 40:20.783
Absolutely. What the hell? Yes.

40:20.818 --> 40:22.785
¶ Together we can do anything ¶

40:22.820 --> 40:24.720
¶ We believe it... ¶

40:24.755 --> 40:26.789
My God, did that just happen?

40:26.824 --> 40:28.724
¶ All the world is
ours to take ¶

40:28.759 --> 40:31.594
¶ You and me, we'll find a way ¶

40:31.629 --> 40:34.664
¶ Oh, the wonder that awaits ¶

40:34.699 --> 40:36.666
¶ Here we are,
forever starts... ¶

40:36.701 --> 40:39.635
Let's take a look at this thing.

40:39.670 --> 40:41.504
Well, I got to be honest,

40:41.539 --> 40:43.473
I thought that, uh,

40:43.508 --> 40:45.675
thought it'd have
a little more bling to it.

40:45.710 --> 40:48.511
Oh, no. You know me.

40:48.546 --> 40:50.813
I'm more bang than bling.

40:50.848 --> 40:51.814
That's right.

40:51.849 --> 40:53.516
Sunshine and gunpowder.

40:53.551 --> 40:54.517
(laughs)

40:54.552 --> 40:57.887
¶<i> Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh</i> ¶

40:57.922 --> 40:59.956
¶ Forever starts today ¶

40:59.991 --> 41:01.591
¶<i> Oh, oh, oh-oh.</i> ¶

41:19.944 --> 41:22.712
My life will never be the same
without her.

41:25.816 --> 41:28.685
I know.

41:30.721 --> 41:32.722
I'm here for you.

41:34.191 --> 41:36.192
We all are.

41:37.228 --> 41:40.597
We always will be.

42:06.958 --> 42:09.592
You know, if there's
anything I can do...

42:13.898 --> 42:17.767
Just take care of Hetty
and the team until I get back.

42:21.772 --> 42:25.341
Spend some time with my kids.

42:25.376 --> 42:28.811
¶ Forever starts today ¶

42:28.846 --> 42:31.948
¶<i> Ooh...</i> ¶

42:31.983 --> 42:32.949
¶ Forever starts today. ¶
