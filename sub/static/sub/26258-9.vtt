WEBVTT

00:09.343 --> 00:10.761
Ba-bum.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.222
[croaks]

00:14.681 --> 00:15.891
[panting]

00:17.684 --> 00:19.520
[dogs growling]

00:20.312 --> 00:22.105
We'll find Callum and Ezran

00:22.189 --> 00:26.235
wherever we find that vile,
bloodthirsty elven assassin.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.905
[Soren] All right, so what else
do we need for this spell?

00:29.988 --> 00:33.951
All we have to do now is climb to the top
of the tallest mountain in Katolis.

00:34.409 --> 00:37.454
<i>Nothing can cut this stupid binding!</i>

00:37.538 --> 00:40.541
It will just get tighter and tighter
until I lose my hand.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.920
-It's a Primal Stone.
-Wow! What's inside?

00:45.003 --> 00:50.008
[Claudia] It's a storm. A real storm.
Captured from the top of Mount Kalik.

00:50.801 --> 00:54.096
-[Ellis] <i>I can't believe you're a mage.</i>
-[Callum] <i>The truth is, it's not me.</i>

00:54.179 --> 00:57.182
<i>All the magic, all the power, </i>
<i>all the confidence...</i>

00:57.266 --> 00:59.268
it's just because of this amazing thing.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.186
A Primal Stone.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.231
That's a dragon egg, isn't it?

01:05.190 --> 01:09.736
-I'm afraid it's dying.
-No. There has to be something you can do.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.864
There was a miracle that happened
a few years ago,

01:12.948 --> 01:15.367
<i>but it happened on the Cursed Caldera.</i>

01:15.909 --> 01:17.911
[Callum] <i>We have to find </i>
<i>this miracle healer.</i>

01:17.995 --> 01:21.206
[Ezran] I have really bad news.
I don't know how to tell you.

01:21.290 --> 01:24.376
<i>Even if we make it to the rim,</i>
<i>it doesn't matter.</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:26.420
There is no miracle healer.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.090
[theme music playing]

01:44.855 --> 01:46.440
[roaring]

02:11.465 --> 02:14.885
There is no miracle healer. I'm sorry.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.720
Stop being mysterious.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.806
If you're gonna make a claim like that,
you owe everyone an explanation.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.351
Okay. Ava told me--

02:22.434 --> 02:23.685
Ugh, here we go!

02:24.061 --> 02:25.479
No, it's true!

02:25.562 --> 02:27.105
I can understand animals.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.815
Well, did you ask Bait?

02:28.899 --> 02:30.776
-He might disagree.
-[croaks]

02:30.859 --> 02:33.654
Or maybe we can find an opinionated
squirrel around here somewhere.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.239
I knew you wouldn't listen to me.

02:37.032 --> 02:37.866
[sighs]

02:37.949 --> 02:39.993
[Rayla] Ezran, I'm listening to you.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.329
But it is pretty hard to believe.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.793
I've always been different.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.504
It's hard for me
to make friends with other kids.

02:50.587 --> 02:53.507
I just feel like I don't fit in.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.676
That's okay. Fitting in is boring anyway.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.345
But with animals?

02:58.428 --> 03:01.807
-Somehow, I have this connection.
-[Bait croaks]

03:01.890 --> 03:05.435
And a few years ago, I realized
I could understand what they were saying.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.231
Can you believe this?

03:09.314 --> 03:10.816
Why would he lie?

03:10.899 --> 03:13.443
Because he's a kid? Because it's fun?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.570
Because he's afraid to go up the mountain?

03:15.654 --> 03:18.865
-I'm not afraid!
-Come on, Ez, tell the truth.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.118
The first time he did this,
I asked him to prove it,

03:21.201 --> 03:23.537
so Ezran said that
a group of raccoons had told him

03:23.620 --> 03:25.705
there was a treasure hidden
behind a waterfall.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.875
But when I went through the waterfall,
did I find a treasure?

03:28.959 --> 03:31.711
-No.
-But did my underwear get soaked?

03:31.795 --> 03:33.880
-Yes.
-Case closed.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.383
The raccoons were being mischievous.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.219
I have since learned
you cannot trust raccoons.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.639
This is ridiculous!
See, this is why you can't make friends.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.891
Callum! Back off.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.727
Do you believe me, Rayla?

03:46.810 --> 03:49.312
[sighs] Does it matter?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.482
I believe you, Ez.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.486
But I also know
the miracle healer is real.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.530
Because I have my Ava!

03:59.072 --> 04:01.700
We're moving on.
We need to get to the rim.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.458
-[horse snorts]
-[Claudia] Mount Kalik.

04:09.541 --> 04:12.002
The tallest mountain in Katolis.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.545
[Soren] You might say it's...

04:14.212 --> 04:15.338
the Ka-tallest.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.175
[laughing]

04:20.427 --> 04:23.513
That is the funniest joke
I've heard in my entire life.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.682
You are a genius.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.018
-Really?
-Why not?

04:28.852 --> 04:32.105
Hey... what's this?

04:32.189 --> 04:33.523
I don't know, what?

04:33.607 --> 04:36.026
[Claudia] The Ka-shortest mountain!

04:36.109 --> 04:38.111
[laughing]

04:40.447 --> 04:43.033
So, now I'm not even sure
you got the original joke.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.538
Look, just to double check...

04:48.622 --> 04:52.042
you do have everything you need
for your weird spell, right?

04:52.125 --> 04:54.211
-Yeah, of course.
-Great.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.546
I... I just don't want to get
all the way to the top of the mountain

04:56.630 --> 04:58.507
and have you suddenly remember
you still need a...

04:58.590 --> 05:00.217
a wasp butt or something.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.136
[scoffs] Wasp butts are useless.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.222
But actually,
there are a lot of interesting things

05:05.305 --> 05:06.973
you can do with a wasp thorax--

05:07.057 --> 05:10.644
You know what?
Could not be less interested.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.104
[Claudia chuckles]

05:20.487 --> 05:24.950
Huh! The higher we walk up this caldera,
the brighter the Moon Rune glows.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.327
[Rayla] Here's a theory.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.038
The higher we walk,
the closer we are to...

05:30.121 --> 05:31.122
the moon.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.126
[Callum] I don't know.
Something seems different this time.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.380
-[disembodied voices moaning]
-[Ava whimpers]

05:39.005 --> 05:40.966
Did anyone else hear that?

05:41.049 --> 05:43.426
[Rayla] Yup! Ignoring it! Keep moving.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.554
[moaning continues]

05:45.637 --> 05:47.806
[Ezran] Maybe we should
find out what it is?

05:47.889 --> 05:50.725
[Rayla] I'm going to share
an old elven proverb with you.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.603
When traveling up a mountain
trying to save a dying dragon egg

05:53.687 --> 05:55.355
and you hear a spooky sound...

05:55.438 --> 05:56.773
just keep walking.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.693
[Callum] Wow, that's really specific.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.612
-[moaning continues]
-[Bait croaks nervously]

06:04.364 --> 06:05.490
What if someone needs help?

06:13.081 --> 06:15.875
Ez, you have a good heart.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.422
It's super annoying.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.507
[Rayla sighs]

06:23.633 --> 06:27.137
Fine, but we shouldn't all go up there.
I'll check it out.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.140
The rest of you stay here
and keep the egg safe.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.066
[moaning continues]

06:59.753 --> 07:02.172
[disembodied voice] Turn back!

07:02.255 --> 07:04.466
Hello? Someone in there?

07:04.549 --> 07:07.344
[disembodied voice] Before it gets you,
too.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.849
I'm not leaving you. Don't worry.
Just hang on, I'm going to help.

07:20.815 --> 07:21.983
[gasps]

07:26.696 --> 07:28.865
-Did you find someone?
-No.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.368
There was no one there.
We have to get moving.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.706
Are you okay? You saw something.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.291
[Rayla sighs]

07:38.375 --> 07:40.543
It was barely alive.

07:40.627 --> 07:44.130
Crumbled to dust right before my eyes.
It was horrible, Callum.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.316
[screams]

08:03.400 --> 08:05.902
-[Callum] Ez, what's wrong?
-I...

08:05.986 --> 08:08.405
I saw something. A face in the dark.

08:16.079 --> 08:19.499
Something's watching us.
If you guys want to turn back--

08:19.582 --> 08:22.085
No! There's no turning back.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.671
We have to keep going, no matter what.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.798
The egg doesn't have much time.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.653
-[Rayla] Hmm.
-Can't you just cut through it?

08:49.696 --> 08:51.823
Probably better if we can go around.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.409
[Ava sniffing]

08:55.785 --> 08:58.455
-[Ava whimpers]
-I don't think there is an "around."

08:58.538 --> 08:59.956
We need to punch through.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.125
[sighs]

09:08.715 --> 09:11.593
All right. Let's find out what made this.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.016
[Rayla] Be careful.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.602
Do not touch those webs!

09:26.524 --> 09:27.942
[indistinct skittering]

09:28.026 --> 09:31.446
[Ezran] Ugh, they're everywhere.
It's too dark!

09:40.121 --> 09:41.539
[skittering continues]

09:47.337 --> 09:49.547
-[Ezran yelps]
-[screeching]

09:52.592 --> 09:53.885
<i>Fulminis!</i>

09:57.847 --> 09:59.891
Ahh! Uh, did I get it? Where'd it go?

09:59.974 --> 10:02.769
[exclaiming] I feel like it's in my hair!

10:02.852 --> 10:05.688
Really? It's a two-ton magical spider.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.440
You'd know if it was in your hair.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.693
-[Ellis] Shh... we need to listen.
-[Ava sniffing]

10:14.906 --> 10:16.616
[indistinct skittering]

10:18.284 --> 10:20.120
[skittering continues]

10:25.875 --> 10:27.502
-[screeching]
-[all screaming]

10:29.629 --> 10:31.214
[Ava barking]

10:33.341 --> 10:35.009
[all panting]

10:36.845 --> 10:38.012
[screeching]

10:39.556 --> 10:41.724
How are we gonna get past that thing?

10:41.808 --> 10:44.185
Even if we manage to get past,

10:44.269 --> 10:48.064
one misstep and we're caught
in one of those crazy webs.

10:48.148 --> 10:52.694
And trust me, you don't want to know
what happens if you get caught in a web.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.281
There has to be a way.
We have to get through.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.449
[screeching loudly]

10:59.742 --> 11:00.785
Wait a second.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.453
[chittering loudly]

11:04.873 --> 11:07.292
-Something's not right...
-[chittering continues]

11:07.375 --> 11:08.960
...in a good way, this time!

11:11.171 --> 11:12.380
[Soren] I know it's late...

11:12.463 --> 11:16.843
but there's something so invigorating
about climbing a mountain at midnight!

11:17.677 --> 11:20.680
The moonlight. Ah, the clouds.

11:20.763 --> 11:24.058
Oh, that fresh night air...
[inhales deeply]

11:25.018 --> 11:27.395
[coughing]

11:27.478 --> 11:30.356
Ahh! Claudia, I think your horse just--

11:30.440 --> 11:32.442
Wasn't the horse.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.864
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm disgusted...

11:38.781 --> 11:40.158
and a little impressed.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.202
[loud chittering]

11:44.370 --> 11:45.538
What should we do?

11:45.622 --> 11:48.791
We could turn back and try to find
another way up the caldera.

11:48.875 --> 11:52.211
[Ezran laughs] No, it's gonna be okay.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.130
We can just walk right past it.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.798
What are you talking about?

11:55.882 --> 11:57.425
It's not real! I'm sure of it.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.261
That doesn't make any sense.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.389
Exactly!
All those crazy chitters and screams...

12:03.473 --> 12:04.933
that's not how spiders talk.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.684
Ezran, you've lost your mind.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.145
-I'm going out there to prove it.
-Don't!

12:12.065 --> 12:13.608
Ezran, no!

12:13.691 --> 12:15.276
[loud chittering]

12:17.654 --> 12:19.656
[screeching loudly]

12:22.033 --> 12:24.077
[Ezran yelling]

12:27.747 --> 12:30.375
[screeching loudly]

12:32.502 --> 12:34.087
[Ezran yelling]

12:34.170 --> 12:36.673
[laughs] It's fun. Try screaming at him.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.637
[screeching loudly]

12:44.347 --> 12:46.265
See? It won't do anything.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.061
You're right.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.271
[loudly] Ez is right!

12:52.814 --> 12:57.193
Let's see if we can get it to turn around
and show us its creepy glow face.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.032
[laughing]

13:03.783 --> 13:05.618
Ezran, I owe you an apology.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.705
Well, at least one.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.707
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.543
I promise, I won't ever doubt you again.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.795
-If you really mean it...
-I do.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.505
...then you have to do the thing.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.216
Here? Now?

13:23.011 --> 13:24.178
[inhales deeply]

13:30.226 --> 13:33.479
[laughing] Callum's famous jerkface dance!

13:33.563 --> 13:35.773
-[laughing]
-[screeching]

13:47.994 --> 13:51.914
So, if it's fake... what's it doing here?

13:51.998 --> 13:55.752
Cheering for the jerkface dance, I think.
It wants more.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.336
Knees higher! Knees higher!

14:10.016 --> 14:11.768
[screeching excitedly]

14:17.356 --> 14:18.316
This is it!

14:19.025 --> 14:23.321
We hid in that tree
when the miracle healer found us!

14:24.238 --> 14:26.866
-Remember this place, girl?
-[Ava barking]

14:29.035 --> 14:30.870
[Callum] So, now what? Do we just...

14:30.953 --> 14:34.374
[loudly] Uh, Miracle Healer?
Hello! We're here!

14:34.457 --> 14:37.835
I don't know. I just showed up,
then she showed up.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.380
Yeah, I don't see why that shouldn't work.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.721
[Rayla] Actually, I think it is working.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.354
[bird screeching]

15:17.834 --> 15:19.085
Oh, no!

15:20.920 --> 15:23.005
Ez was right about everything.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.842
That's no miracle healer. She's a fake.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.261
[Callum] What? How do you know?

15:28.344 --> 15:31.097
She's a moon mage, an illusionist.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.224
She can't heal anything.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.310
It's true. I am no healer.

15:36.394 --> 15:40.440
I am Lujanne. Guardian of the Moon Nexus.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.860
Ugh, I'm such an idiot,
I should have figured it out.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.447
None of those monsters were real,
they were all illusions.

15:47.530 --> 15:52.160
Yes. They were just to scare you.
That's how I protect the Nexus.

15:52.827 --> 15:55.288
But... I don't understand.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.708
If you're not a healer,
how did you save Ava's leg?

16:01.294 --> 16:04.088
I remember you and that little cub...

16:04.172 --> 16:06.632
both so frightened and sad.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.178
<i>I saw she had lost her leg,</i>

16:10.261 --> 16:13.764
<i>and I understood that humans </i>
<i>would have trouble accepting her.</i>

16:16.267 --> 16:20.938
<i>But I knew her spirit was strong</i>
<i>and that was all that really mattered.</i>

16:22.148 --> 16:23.274
[Ellis sobbing]

16:27.778 --> 16:31.073
[Lujanne] Oh, what a beautiful creature.

16:31.157 --> 16:34.202
[voice breaking] No... she's hurt.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.830
She's perfect.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.876
[indistinct chanting]

16:50.301 --> 16:53.930
[Lujanne] <i>To help you,</i>
<i>I created an illusion.</i>

16:54.514 --> 16:58.935
<i>A leg that others would see and feel, </i>
<i>even though it wasn't real.</i>

17:02.855 --> 17:05.691
I enchanted the moonstone collar
to hold the spell.

17:06.609 --> 17:09.862
She never needed that fourth leg
to be happy.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.197
Everyone else did.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.540
But the help we need is real.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.375
An illusion won't help us.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.004
[gasps]

17:28.631 --> 17:33.219
[Rayla] It's the egg of the Dragon Prince.
It was stolen, but we saved it.

17:33.302 --> 17:37.139
I mean, we were trying to save it
and return it to its mother.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.226
But there was a terrible accident.
You see, I--

17:43.062 --> 17:44.897
Its life is fading quickly.

17:44.981 --> 17:48.901
The only chance of saving it now
would be to hatch it.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.489
But that won't be possible.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.367
Sky dragons can only be born
in the eye of a storm.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.245
The weather is clear for miles.

18:04.917 --> 18:09.130
No... that can't be.
There has to be a way to save it!

18:09.213 --> 18:10.756
[softly] I'm sorry.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.600
I dropped it. This is all my fault.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.937
No, I should have trusted you.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.315
Things only went wrong
because we kept fighting.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.318
I let you both down.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.237
I let the world down.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.531
You tried, Rayla.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.449
[exclaims]

18:36.532 --> 18:39.035
You're so good and brave.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.881
Wait a minute.
It can only hatch... in a storm.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.260
-What if I...
-[lightning crackles faintly]

18:58.596 --> 18:59.847
I know what I have to do.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.729
[electricity crackling]

19:27.166 --> 19:28.501
[Ezran] No!

19:50.398 --> 19:51.440
[Bait grunts]

19:56.612 --> 19:58.114
Hold on, Rayla!

20:01.450 --> 20:02.576
Ahh!

20:27.184 --> 20:29.019
[lightning crackles]

21:26.494 --> 21:27.495
[cracking]

21:35.836 --> 21:37.254
[yawns]

21:41.217 --> 21:42.051
[yips]

21:43.719 --> 21:47.681
Come on Bait, help him!
His eyes are stuck.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.060
-[Bait grunts]
-You need to lick them open!

22:01.445 --> 22:02.446
[yips inquisitively]

22:05.241 --> 22:06.909
[Ezran laughs]

22:14.083 --> 22:16.752
You know your own name! Azymondias.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.257
-We'll call you "Zym."
-[Bait grunts]

22:21.340 --> 22:25.594
That's Rayla. You almost blew off
the mountain, but Rayla saved you!

22:30.683 --> 22:32.268
[purrs softly]

22:33.602 --> 22:36.188
[Rayla] Aww! It's okay, little one.

22:36.272 --> 22:40.359
The important thing is you.
One miracle is enough for me today.

22:58.961 --> 22:59.962
[laughs]

23:16.312 --> 23:17.980
[wind howling]

23:19.315 --> 23:22.067
-Couldn't you do this someplace warmer?
-No.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.986
But if you like,

23:24.069 --> 23:27.573
I can use these rare components
to conjure a magical blanket for you

23:27.656 --> 23:30.576
instead of using them
to locate the lost princes?

23:30.659 --> 23:33.329
You would be insanely comfortable.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.748
[grunts] Fine, I'll suffer.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.840
[chanting indistinctly]

23:55.517 --> 23:58.437
[chanting continues]

24:03.192 --> 24:04.026
[Claudia] There!

24:05.069 --> 24:06.695
That's where we'll find them.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.282
[Ezran laughing]

24:12.451 --> 24:13.452
Look.

24:22.753 --> 24:23.962
It's beautiful.

24:26.048 --> 24:29.218
They're gentle. They even tickle a little.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.719
[blows]

24:33.555 --> 24:34.932
[chitters excitedly]

24:38.227 --> 24:39.520
[grunts]

24:39.603 --> 24:40.813
[belches]

24:40.896 --> 24:42.064
[both laughing]
