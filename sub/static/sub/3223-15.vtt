WEBVTT

00:07.215 --> 00:08.633
Freaking witches.

00:09.884 --> 00:13.679
I figured out how to close the gates
of hell. God built a series of tests.

00:13.888 --> 00:16.432
- You do all three, slam the gates.
- Where do we start?

00:16.641 --> 00:20.228
You've gotta kill a hound of hell
and bathe in its blood.

00:20.436 --> 00:23.314
I need you to be safe,
so I'm gonna do these trials.

00:27.443 --> 00:28.486
Agh!

00:28.694 --> 00:30.238
- I didn't pass the tests.
- I did.

00:30.446 --> 00:32.740
- I'm doing the rest of them.
- My ass, you are.

00:33.741 --> 00:35.034
I can do this.

00:43.834 --> 00:45.545
- That was great.
- Yeah.

00:45.753 --> 00:48.130
- Thanks for letting me do that.
- Okay.

00:48.923 --> 00:52.635
Here, let me give you
a little something.

00:54.887 --> 00:56.180
There you go. Thanks.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.974
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:37.638 --> 01:39.307
Guess it's not my night.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.559
Guess not.

03:13.442 --> 03:15.945
Wow, of all the lame-ass things
you've ever said...

03:16.153 --> 03:17.863
...that's gotta be the lame-assiest.

03:18.072 --> 03:21.951
I'm sorry, but I happen to think Shemp
was a funnier Stooge than Curly.

03:22.159 --> 03:25.454
- Curly was a freaking genius.
- I found Curly's work a bit obvious.

03:25.663 --> 03:28.082
It's supposed to be obvious, man.
They're Stooges.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.504
- So are we calling James tonight?
- No, let's just call him tomorrow.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.756
The drive was a bitch.

03:36.632 --> 03:39.593
- I wonder what he wanted.
- His text said that he needed help.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.762
He's a cop.
I figured it was work-related.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.056
Yeah, well, we do owe him.

03:44.932 --> 03:48.018
The guy saved our lives once, Sammy.
It's not like the guy...

03:48.227 --> 03:49.395
Saved our lives?

03:52.148 --> 03:55.192
- Gonna go for a beer run. Need anything?
- No, I'm good.

03:56.485 --> 03:58.404
- You sure?
- Yeah.

04:00.614 --> 04:05.536
Because you did just gank a hellhound,
which is no slice of pie...

04:05.745 --> 04:08.581
...and there's a minefield
of who-knows-what-crap ahead.

04:08.789 --> 04:11.709
Just wanna make sure
that you are okay.

04:14.253 --> 04:15.671
I'm good.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.923
You know,
we could find another devil dog...

04:18.132 --> 04:20.968
...you could tag out,
I could snuff the son of a bitch.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.386
Dean.

04:22.928 --> 04:25.473
Kevin doesn't even know
what the next trial is yet.

04:25.681 --> 04:29.977
So whatever it is
you're worried about, stop.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.729
I'll be ready.

05:12.853 --> 05:14.438
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.775
Uh... Oh, no.

05:19.109 --> 05:22.321
Hey, you friendly?

05:23.155 --> 05:25.074
Friendly, good. All right.

05:25.282 --> 05:27.159
You're a pretty dog.

05:27.701 --> 05:31.330
Oh, really, you want a little
belly scratch, huh?

05:31.539 --> 05:35.125
So who you belong to? Uh...

05:36.585 --> 05:38.379
Right, no tags.

05:38.587 --> 05:40.798
Uh, what are you doing here?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.178
Oh, no.

05:48.013 --> 05:49.723
Hey.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.352
- Hey.
- Okay, okay, okay.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.689
Before you get pissed off,
I want you to know this isn't my fault.

05:56.897 --> 05:59.984
She just showed up at the door, okay?

06:00.192 --> 06:02.862
Didn't track in any mud.
Just wanted her belly scratched.

06:03.070 --> 06:05.281
I figured maybe
she could stay tonight...

06:05.489 --> 06:08.200
...and we'd try and find her
a home tomorrow.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.837
She can stay the night.

06:24.258 --> 06:25.843
Two seconds ago, she was a dog.

06:27.052 --> 06:28.554
All right, who the hell are you?

06:28.762 --> 06:32.182
Not a Shapeshifter,
so you can stash the blade.

06:32.975 --> 06:34.310
I'm a familiar.

06:35.060 --> 06:38.022
- A what?
- Companion to a witch.

06:38.230 --> 06:39.398
Some witches.

06:39.607 --> 06:42.484
They split their time between
human and animal form.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.739
I get a more accurate read on people
in my other persona.

06:46.947 --> 06:49.158
Approaching guys in a
motel room like this...

06:49.366 --> 06:51.327
- ...that gets complicated.
- Hmm.

06:51.535 --> 06:54.496
My name's Portia.
I belong to James Frampton.

06:56.081 --> 06:58.751
No. No, no.
See, that doesn't work for us...

06:58.959 --> 07:02.504
...because that would mean
that our buddy James is a witch.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.215
Wow, you're quick.

07:06.091 --> 07:08.844
- James is a freaking witch?
- He wasn't when you met him.

07:09.053 --> 07:12.681
- But that last case you worked on...
- A lunatic alchemist. It was nasty.

07:14.391 --> 07:16.560
James wanted to learn more
about that world.

07:16.769 --> 07:20.147
Black arts, witchcraft.
Became the center of his life.

07:20.856 --> 07:24.735
Wait, so you're telling me
that James the cop...

07:24.944 --> 07:28.364
...became a witch because of us?
Uh-uh. Heh.

07:29.657 --> 07:32.034
You don't like dogs, do you?

07:33.327 --> 07:35.704
Wait, so James isn't a cop anymore?

07:35.913 --> 07:38.666
Sure, he is. Homicide detective.

07:38.874 --> 07:40.793
His new powers
make his work even better.

07:41.001 --> 07:44.463
- Then what does he need from us?
- Something has been happening to him.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.841
It started with excruciating headaches.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.637
Screaming sounds in his ears.
Horrible nightmares.

07:51.845 --> 07:55.432
Unable to sleep or think.
He can't work.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.559
It's like he's having a breakdown.

07:57.768 --> 08:00.813
Maybe you can find a way to help him.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.484
Well, here's the thing.

08:05.693 --> 08:09.238
Witches, not real fans.

08:11.615 --> 08:14.743
Really? Well, James is a cop
with a spotless record.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.121
He's used his skills
for nothing but good.

08:17.329 --> 08:21.333
So why don't you lose the ignorant bigotry
for maybe two seconds...

08:21.542 --> 08:22.835
...and give him a shot?

08:27.589 --> 08:29.717
That was incredibly hot.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.054
It was pretty hot.

09:10.507 --> 09:12.551
Might wanna go easy on that.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.972
God, you look awful.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.893
Not getting any better?

09:21.643 --> 09:22.811
Worse.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.898
I don't know what's happening to me.

09:26.106 --> 09:27.983
These dreams.

09:28.442 --> 09:31.862
They're like, uh... Like torture.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.573
You didn't mention dreams.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.242
Dark.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.369
Bloody.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.206
Spencer, they, uh...

09:43.624 --> 09:45.876
They scare the hell out of me.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.961
They're so real.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.671
Just night after night.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.925
Enough, James.
It's time to see someone.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.677
Who?

09:57.679 --> 09:59.223
Who do we see?

10:01.809 --> 10:04.061
There's no medicine for this.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.774
Maybe you just need time away.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.236
It's way beyond that.

10:13.570 --> 10:15.656
James, it's too much.

10:16.156 --> 10:18.367
All that you've taken on.

10:19.034 --> 10:22.204
Not just the workload,
but the nature of the work.

10:22.412 --> 10:26.625
Look around.
See a lot of cops, do you?

10:28.293 --> 10:33.340
Life in this realm is life on the fringe.
We don't fit.

10:35.717 --> 10:40.389
How do you reconcile what you are
with what you do?

10:43.475 --> 10:45.477
I don't know where Portia is.

10:46.186 --> 10:47.229
What?

10:49.231 --> 10:50.440
She's gone.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.820
I think I'm pushing her away.

10:59.366 --> 11:01.618
These dreams James has,
he thinks they're real?

11:01.827 --> 11:05.747
- He thinks he is actually killing people?
- I think so.

11:06.206 --> 11:09.251
That's what I picked up
before he started blocking me.

11:09.459 --> 11:11.086
What does that mean, blocking you?

11:11.295 --> 11:14.882
Familiars and their masters,
we can communicate telepathically.

11:15.883 --> 11:19.178
I could get inside of James's head
any time I wanted...

11:19.386 --> 11:20.721
...but he shut me out.

11:20.929 --> 11:23.515
You think there's something
he doesn't want you to see?

11:23.724 --> 11:25.267
Possibly, yeah.

11:25.475 --> 11:28.020
Something dark, you know,
that's destroying him.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.691
He can't go to the police
and he doesn't trust other witches.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.486
But he trusts us?
You do know who we are, right?

11:36.695 --> 11:40.365
We're the last people
James needs to be telling his troubles to.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.995
This was my idea. I was the one who
sent you the texts under James's name.

11:45.204 --> 11:50.209
He doesn't know you're here,
but I think you may be all he has.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.609
Someone there?

12:26.203 --> 12:27.913
You had no right to do this.

12:28.121 --> 12:29.748
I was afraid for your life.

12:29.957 --> 12:33.377
My life is none of their business!

12:46.139 --> 12:48.308
Sam, Dean.

12:49.226 --> 12:52.688
Witchcraft, James, really?
What the hell were you thinking?

12:53.480 --> 12:55.023
You come to help or pile on?

12:55.774 --> 12:57.901
I'm just saying,
you screw with that stuff...

12:58.110 --> 13:00.279
- ...you're gonna fry your wiring.
- All right.

13:01.196 --> 13:03.740
Look, why don't you tell us
about these dreams?

13:03.949 --> 13:06.660
She said people were dying in them.

13:07.911 --> 13:10.998
Dying? They were torn to bits.

13:11.206 --> 13:12.416
I, uh...

13:12.624 --> 13:15.335
...could feel my fingers
ripping into their flesh.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.753
But they were dreams?

13:17.504 --> 13:20.382
Well, I, uh, woke up in my bed.

13:20.590 --> 13:22.801
Okay, so dreams?

13:23.302 --> 13:24.469
I'm not so sure.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.139
Not helping, James.

13:27.347 --> 13:30.017
Those people, they died.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.853
I checked with the precinct.

13:34.479 --> 13:37.983
All right, well, maybe you heard it
and it stuck in your head.

13:39.276 --> 13:43.238
You don't think I told myself all that?
You don't think I didn't say:

13:43.447 --> 13:47.242
"That wasn't me.
I couldn't have done such a thing"?

13:53.498 --> 13:54.833
Is it yours?

13:58.420 --> 13:59.755
James Martin Frampton.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.305
What's happening to me?

14:08.513 --> 14:11.350
Well, how about this? Um...

14:11.558 --> 14:16.813
You pissed off another witch and
he or she hexed you and forced you to...

14:17.856 --> 14:21.026
It's possible, I suppose,
but I never heard of it.

14:21.234 --> 14:24.654
- How many dreams have you had?
- Four.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.240
Most recent was last night.

14:28.116 --> 14:29.910
He was a blind man.

14:30.118 --> 14:31.578
I, uh...

14:32.496 --> 14:34.915
I was choking him and, uh...

14:36.124 --> 14:38.794
All right, James,
we're gonna help you figure this out...

14:39.002 --> 14:40.629
...but you have to do your part.

14:42.297 --> 14:43.924
Which is?

14:52.599 --> 14:54.559
You're gonna have to stay put.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.525
House arrest, my friend.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.154
Got the last of it.

15:06.363 --> 15:08.990
Well, I have been looking
at the crime scene reports...

15:09.199 --> 15:12.202
...and they are exactly
the same as James told us.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.371
Vics, dates, location.

15:14.579 --> 15:17.207
The most recent one was a blind man,
just like he said.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.543
That's not good.

15:19.751 --> 15:22.379
Also, I looked into
his record on the force.

15:22.587 --> 15:25.632
He went from rookie detective
to lieutenant overnight.

15:25.841 --> 15:30.429
And in the last four years, his solve
rate's been right at about 100 percent.

15:31.388 --> 15:34.391
Of course,
he's got the booga-booga on his side.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.145
Man, you know
that we've never actually seen...

15:38.353 --> 15:41.022
...this witch-killing spell
of Bobby's work, right?

15:41.231 --> 15:44.359
- I mean, this is not a sure thing.
- Heh.

15:44.901 --> 15:47.028
Is anything we ever do a sure thing?

15:47.237 --> 15:51.408
Well, no, but I would just like to have
the odds in our favor...

15:51.616 --> 15:52.993
...as much as possible.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.704
Right.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.542
Well, I'm concerned.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.547
Concerned about the, uh...
The witch-killing spell?

16:06.965 --> 16:08.800
Or that I'm gonna mess
these trials up?

16:12.721 --> 16:16.683
Look, we get too far down the
road with this, we can't go back.

16:18.685 --> 16:22.939
- And it'll be too late for me to jump in.
- Who says that you're gonna have to?

16:23.356 --> 16:26.610
- Maybe I'll actually pull this one off.
- I'm just saying...

16:26.818 --> 16:29.112
I know what you're saying, Dean.
You've said it.

16:29.863 --> 16:34.493
You know, I've been going over this
and over this...

16:34.910 --> 16:37.370
...asking myself,
"Why doesn't he trust me?"

16:38.121 --> 16:41.208
And it occurred to me finally.
It's not that you don't trust me.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.002
It's that you can only trust you.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.341
- You done?
- Yeah, I'm done if you're done.

16:54.095 --> 16:57.265
You know, once I get this put together...

16:58.725 --> 17:01.394
...we can't hesitate.
If we gotta use it, we use it.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.522
You mean if we find the witch
that's doing this to James.

17:04.731 --> 17:06.650
Or if there is no other witch.

17:07.150 --> 17:10.779
Or it wouldn't be the first
free pass we've given, Dean.

17:12.321 --> 17:16.785
Look, I like James as much as the next guy,
but people are getting ganked here.

17:17.993 --> 17:22.165
Besides, Benny, Kate,
they were forced to be what they are.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.666
James chose this.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.422
- Vics were all torn up pretty bad.
- Like someone shredded him...

17:29.631 --> 17:33.802
...with their bare hands. Heh.
Like that could happen. Ed.

17:35.011 --> 17:36.846
Ed Stoltz. He's lead on the case.

17:37.055 --> 17:38.723
Special Agent Keith.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.268
Josh here tells me
you don't have a lot to go on.

17:41.476 --> 17:45.021
Yeah. Isolated parts of the city.
Vics who meant nothing to nobody.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.691
My partner and I
had a look at the crime scenes.

17:47.899 --> 17:50.735
Things really must be slow
at the Bureau. Heh, heh.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.363
Locations have already
been knocked down.

17:53.572 --> 17:57.033
Well, we did manage to find
this piece of fabric.

17:57.742 --> 18:00.453
Things get overlooked. It happens.

18:01.162 --> 18:04.332
Why don't you run the blood?
Could be the vic, could be the doer's.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.042
Let's see if we get a match.

18:07.711 --> 18:11.506
A witness did mention seeing a man
in a suit and white shirt leaving the area.

18:11.715 --> 18:14.718
You didn't mention a witness
in your report. Anything else?

18:16.136 --> 18:17.178
No.

18:18.221 --> 18:20.890
We'll get back to you on the lab work.
So if that's all...

18:21.099 --> 18:24.394
- Sure, but this witness...
- That's all that was said, Agent Keith.

18:24.603 --> 18:28.815
We really don't have a lot here, okay?
We'll be in touch.

18:45.081 --> 18:49.294
- I getting the stink-eye in here or what?
- They can tell you're an outsider.

18:49.502 --> 18:52.464
- Are they all witches?
- And stuff.

18:52.672 --> 18:56.593
But if there's information out here
about James, they'll know.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.889
How did James find you, anyway?

19:01.097 --> 19:02.932
Not the way it works.

19:03.141 --> 19:06.603
The familiar finds the master
and they become inseparable.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.023
Guess a lot of people
feel that way about their pets.

19:10.940 --> 19:14.486
- What?
- Heh, I'm not James's pet.

19:15.111 --> 19:17.530
Well, not all the time.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.908
Not ever.

19:21.076 --> 19:24.829
The master and the familiar,
there's an unbreakable bond.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.665
Like a melding of souls.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.167
We would die for each other.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.753
Portia.

19:32.295 --> 19:33.672
Over here.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.219
Dean, meet Phillippe LeChat.

19:40.762 --> 19:44.057
- Dean's a Wiccan from Detroit.
- Really?

19:44.265 --> 19:46.976
Well, sit, sit.

19:49.270 --> 19:52.148
- Spencer here?
- Somewhere.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.779
That's weird.
It only happens around cats.

19:59.447 --> 20:03.201
Tell me about James.
Lot of buzz out there.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.495
All gossip.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.873
The community has a little attitude going.

20:09.082 --> 20:12.085
Heh. He brings it on himself.

20:12.293 --> 20:14.546
The whole cop thing.

20:14.754 --> 20:18.216
- Witch cop, is he nuts?
- I said the exact same thing.

20:19.801 --> 20:20.969
Then there's you, babe.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.765
It isn't done, Portia, and you know it.

20:28.309 --> 20:32.188
- I'm sorry, uh, remind me. What isn't done?
- Portia.

20:35.900 --> 20:39.571
Uh, I'm a... I'm a Wiccan.
I'm from Detroit.

20:41.489 --> 20:43.366
Spencer is the man to ask.

20:43.616 --> 20:46.077
Oh, okay. Um...

20:46.494 --> 20:48.079
You ever heard of a spell...

20:48.288 --> 20:51.458
...where a witch can control
the actions of another witch?

20:54.294 --> 20:58.882
No, I've never heard of a thing like that.
I don't think it's possible.

21:00.884 --> 21:04.721
- How's James?
- Better. I'll tell him you asked.

21:06.765 --> 21:10.810
- Phillippe, it's time we were going.
- Of course.

21:11.269 --> 21:13.146
Good night.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.024
So nice to meet you.

21:31.748 --> 21:32.832
I knew it.

21:36.711 --> 21:39.214
Excuse me. Yeah.

21:39.422 --> 21:41.758
- Where are you?
- Some witch bar, why?

21:41.966 --> 21:45.053
I just got the lab work back
from the blood on James's shirt.

21:45.261 --> 21:46.387
- And?
- Not good.

21:46.971 --> 21:49.849
Blood is an exact match
to victim number three.

21:50.725 --> 21:53.061
- That pretty much says it all, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

22:05.114 --> 22:06.449
I hate doing this to you.

22:10.078 --> 22:13.164
It's okay, really.

22:14.582 --> 22:18.378
We don't have to.
You know, they wouldn't find out.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.130
Portia...

22:21.798 --> 22:25.593
...if I believe I'm innocent,
I have to do the right thing.

22:27.303 --> 22:31.766
And if I'm not innocent,
I have to do the right thing.

22:39.148 --> 22:41.192
Tell me one day this will be over.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.202
I love you.

24:20.249 --> 24:22.418
No! No, Dean.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.463
You have to listen to me, please.
It's not James.

24:36.891 --> 24:38.559
Tonight...

24:39.227 --> 24:43.064
...James and I were close,
without psychological walls.

24:43.898 --> 24:45.441
Intimate.

24:46.734 --> 24:48.820
- I don't...
- They had sex.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.157
Wow.

24:55.034 --> 24:56.911
I, uh, didn't expect that.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.455
We have an unusual relationship.

24:59.664 --> 25:03.251
Familiars aren't supposed to be
sexually involved with their witches.

25:04.043 --> 25:06.754
Understandable.
You know, considering that you're a...

25:09.298 --> 25:11.592
Well, and that he's...

25:12.802 --> 25:15.388
That's... Heh. Little help here?

25:16.931 --> 25:17.974
No?

25:18.182 --> 25:20.893
James and I,
we hadn't made love in weeks.

25:21.102 --> 25:23.229
His agony ate him up
and he shut me out.

25:23.896 --> 25:27.692
But tonight I saw his thoughts.

25:27.900 --> 25:29.652
Memories of the murders.

25:29.861 --> 25:33.031
I'm sorry, is this you trying to talk us
out of ganking James or...?

25:33.239 --> 25:35.575
Dean, that's all I saw. Just the kills.

25:35.783 --> 25:40.038
No preparation, no thought process,
no anticipation, no motive.

25:40.246 --> 25:41.956
Just the kills without context.

25:42.165 --> 25:44.292
- No other awareness of the crimes?
- No.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.839
Doesn't that at least suggest
he's under another's control?

25:50.048 --> 25:53.760
- Spencer said that wasn't possible.
- He said he never heard of it.

25:54.802 --> 25:56.888
James is chained.

25:57.096 --> 25:58.389
He's confined.

25:59.432 --> 26:00.767
At least take a shot.

26:11.319 --> 26:12.445
Gentlemen.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.866
Still investigating
this crappy little case?

26:17.075 --> 26:19.660
I'm awed the Bureau has so much time
on its hands.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.955
Right, well, we have some, uh,
individual discretion...

26:23.164 --> 26:25.124
- ...to pursue cases.
- I'll catch up later.

26:25.333 --> 26:28.544
But at some point cases like this go cold,
I'm sure you're aware.

26:28.753 --> 26:32.340
- Just not enough to keep them floating.
- Sure.

26:32.548 --> 26:33.966
- No new leads, then?
- No.

26:34.175 --> 26:37.929
And it's drifting towards the back burner.
We just don't have the manpower.

26:38.137 --> 26:41.974
Must have been tough to lose a valuable
resource like Lieutenant Frampton.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.605
See, he and I, we, uh...
We caught a case together a while back.

26:48.898 --> 26:51.025
Well, he's not lost.
I mean, he's on leave.

26:51.776 --> 26:56.322
I remember he said he was the youngest guy
here to ever make lieutenant.

26:56.531 --> 26:58.950
- Must have made a few waves.
- No.

26:59.158 --> 27:02.203
This place is run like a dogsled.
No stars, just grunts.

27:02.411 --> 27:06.624
One mutt goes lame, another one pops up
and slogs through the slush.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.417
Agent.

27:36.237 --> 27:39.824
So this, uh, warlock we're meeting,
he's a snitch?

27:40.491 --> 27:42.827
Cops have snitches all over town.

27:43.035 --> 27:46.205
James uses Drexyl when he suspects
someone in the community.

27:53.671 --> 27:56.591
I gotta ask. I can't help but wonder...

27:56.799 --> 27:58.509
Which came first, dog or girl?

27:59.719 --> 28:00.887
Yeah.

28:01.095 --> 28:04.974
Yeah, I mean, I'm just curious as to
which one you consider yourself mostly.

28:06.976 --> 28:10.938
This have anything to do with what I
told you about James and me last night?

28:12.106 --> 28:14.150
How you're imagining it?

28:15.776 --> 28:17.195
What?

28:17.653 --> 28:19.572
No. That's... Heh.

28:19.780 --> 28:20.823
Yes.

28:37.590 --> 28:39.133
Drexyl, this is Dean.

28:39.342 --> 28:41.636
Wiccan. Detroit. I heard.

28:41.844 --> 28:43.846
So here's the deal.

28:44.055 --> 28:47.767
Absolutely no word on the street
about any witch hexing another one.

28:47.975 --> 28:49.894
You sure there's not any kind of spell?

28:50.102 --> 28:53.397
Look, Detroit,
I pride myself on reliable sourcing.

28:54.565 --> 28:57.318
There is, however,
a lot of chatter about our James.

28:57.526 --> 29:00.029
- What kind of chatter?
- That he's gone ripper.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.864
As in Jack the...?

29:02.073 --> 29:05.117
Someone's circulating the rumor
that he's set at full kill.

29:05.326 --> 29:07.495
Someone? One of us?

29:07.703 --> 29:11.207
If the cops get wind of it, arrest James,
find out what he really is...

29:11.415 --> 29:12.917
...that exposes the rest of us.

29:13.751 --> 29:15.670
You know that can't happen.

29:16.128 --> 29:17.171
Meaning?

29:17.380 --> 29:22.426
They're gonna give James two choices:
leave or the full hara-kiri.

29:23.636 --> 29:24.679
Suicide?

29:25.388 --> 29:28.808
- Witches appreciate the grand gesture.
- I won't let him do that.

29:29.016 --> 29:31.519
Well, the community might do it for him.

29:43.155 --> 29:44.198
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:45.032 --> 29:47.576
So I have been going over
Bobby's data.

29:47.785 --> 29:50.913
- Anything?
- Uh, Portia might not be wrong.

29:51.414 --> 29:55.918
Turns out there is a spell for implanting
images into another person's brain.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.129
- Really?
- Yeah. Uh...

29:58.337 --> 30:02.300
"Creating false memories
into another witch's mind."

30:02.758 --> 30:04.176
Wow. Heh.

30:04.385 --> 30:08.097
James could be convinced he killed
those people without ever touching them?

30:08.306 --> 30:10.975
- Maybe it is somebody else.
- Going to a lot of trouble...

30:11.183 --> 30:13.728
...to make it look like James.
What do the cops say?

30:13.936 --> 30:16.689
That's the thing.
Um, according to Ed Stoltz, they got zip.

30:16.897 --> 30:20.318
But they got something. I saw the, uh,
tech guy who's working the case...

30:20.526 --> 30:23.404
...and he had a huge file folder
marked "James Frampton."

30:23.612 --> 30:26.741
- Ed didn't mention that?
- No, he did not.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.743
All right. Ahem.

30:29.368 --> 30:31.120
Oh, by the way, gotta hand it to you.

30:31.329 --> 30:35.166
It's been 15 hours since Portia
mentioned her night with James.

30:35.374 --> 30:37.460
And not one bestiality joke out of you.

30:44.425 --> 30:48.637
Portia tells me my friends in the community
want me burned at the stake.

30:48.846 --> 30:51.599
Not gonna lie, it's,
uh... It's getting ugly.

30:51.807 --> 30:54.018
Cops have more on the case
than they're saying.

30:54.226 --> 30:56.312
- Including a thick dossier on you.
- Me?

30:56.520 --> 30:58.647
Yeah.
I get the feeling whatever they have...

30:58.856 --> 31:02.651
...is under lock and key at the precinct.
Uh, Room C-110.

31:03.402 --> 31:05.071
Then we need to break in.

31:05.279 --> 31:08.115
Sure, a locked room
in a joint crawling with cops 24/7.

31:08.324 --> 31:09.617
Why didn't I think of that?

31:09.825 --> 31:14.205
Dean, a witch can go to a place
without having to go to a place.

31:15.664 --> 31:16.832
What, like phone sex?

31:17.541 --> 31:21.087
Astral projection.
I can project my awareness anywhere.

31:21.295 --> 31:22.671
Oh.

31:23.214 --> 31:26.509
From the comfort of right here.
But these have gotta go.

31:26.926 --> 31:27.968
Not gonna happen.

31:28.469 --> 31:31.347
Irons on, no magic.
No magic, no break-in.

31:33.349 --> 31:34.809
Okay.

31:35.393 --> 31:36.936
But only if we can go with you.

31:46.278 --> 31:49.824
James, are you sure
you're still even able to do this?

31:51.158 --> 31:53.994
That's a confidence builder.
Anything else I should know...

31:54.203 --> 31:56.872
...before I become some disembodied thing
at his mercy?

31:57.081 --> 31:59.083
Just close your eyes.

31:59.291 --> 32:01.752
Whatever I see,
I'll pass on to you two.

33:08.652 --> 33:11.906
Give us a little warning
if you're gonna snap us back like that.

33:12.114 --> 33:15.951
- Stoltz. He's building a case against me.
- What?

33:17.077 --> 33:21.332
Ed, he's always wanted
a breakthrough case.

33:21.916 --> 33:24.960
Nailing a renegade cop,
that would qualify.

33:25.503 --> 33:28.631
Yeah, especially one he holds
a grudge against.

33:29.548 --> 33:32.885
My first case.
They dropped him as lead detective.

33:33.093 --> 33:34.136
They went with me.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.515
So, what is this, you think, a payback?

33:38.516 --> 33:41.644
He can't just arrest you.
He needs evidence, he needs proof.

33:41.852 --> 33:44.355
He's got it. He's got everything.

33:44.855 --> 33:46.649
- From who?
- Phil.

33:47.441 --> 33:48.526
The cat.

33:50.152 --> 33:51.320
Phillippe.

33:53.322 --> 33:56.242
- Hey, take it easy. Talk this out, buddy.
- James, hey.

34:02.164 --> 34:05.251
- James, don't. We'll do this together.
- No, we won't.

34:05.459 --> 34:08.045
It's not safe for you.
Our time together is over.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.505
Standing by you is my duty, my choice.

34:10.714 --> 34:13.884
Portia, the ceiling is coming down on me.
You still have a life.

34:14.092 --> 34:17.179
- Please.
- Portia, go.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.639
- James.
- Go!

34:29.233 --> 34:31.110
It's not too late for me
to wear braces?

34:31.318 --> 34:34.530
Won't even notice them.
We'll put in transparents.

34:41.328 --> 34:43.163
James, what are you doing?

34:43.371 --> 34:46.250
- Why are you telling lies about me?
- I'm not. I wouldn't.

34:46.458 --> 34:47.793
I saw the evidence room.

34:48.002 --> 34:51.422
I saw the police sketch
based on an eye-witness account.

34:53.632 --> 34:54.675
Get lost.

34:55.967 --> 34:58.220
Please, don't.

34:58.429 --> 34:59.555
Tell me why.

35:00.055 --> 35:03.142
- I had no choice.
- What does that mean?

35:04.059 --> 35:07.396
- My master made me.
- Liar.

35:07.605 --> 35:11.025
You're a coward and a liar.
Spencer is my friend.

35:11.233 --> 35:12.318
A direct command.

35:13.277 --> 35:16.363
Please, don't hurt my face.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.075
I'm not interested...

35:23.746 --> 35:26.165
He was always spineless.

35:28.167 --> 35:30.044
Now literally.

35:41.555 --> 35:43.182
It was you?

35:45.100 --> 35:46.560
You were behind all this?

35:48.771 --> 35:51.315
I humbly accept credit.

35:53.067 --> 35:55.277
You made me think I was a killer.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.366
Ed Stoltz put you up to it.

36:00.574 --> 36:03.702
He found out you were a witch,
tried to blackmail you.

36:05.204 --> 36:07.289
You're not using your thinking cap,
Jimmy.

36:08.207 --> 36:10.834
It was crucial that he didn't
believe in the occult.

36:11.377 --> 36:14.046
I'd say he's built quite a solid case,
don't you?

36:14.963 --> 36:16.465
I don't understand.

36:16.965 --> 36:18.634
Of course you don't.

36:18.842 --> 36:21.220
Neither of you ever considered my feelings.

36:23.597 --> 36:24.640
Portia?

36:28.560 --> 36:30.270
This is about her?

36:31.063 --> 36:34.233
Can you imagine the insult
when she chose you?

36:36.318 --> 36:38.862
I wanted her as my soul mate
the moment I saw her.

36:39.863 --> 36:42.116
She was meant to be my familiar.

36:42.324 --> 36:46.036
Oh, she's way more than familiar,
isn't she?

36:46.245 --> 36:49.289
When she picked you as master,
I endured it.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.917
But when you two went all
Bella and Edward...

36:52.126 --> 36:55.421
...broke the code, put your passions
before the community rules...

36:56.422 --> 37:01.885
...well, the arrogance,
the entitlement was too much.

37:02.094 --> 37:04.638
Your total ruination
seemed appropriate.

37:08.392 --> 37:09.977
The Wiccan from Detroit.

37:10.185 --> 37:12.646
So, James didn't kill those people...?
Agh!

37:20.821 --> 37:24.742
Seriously? You wanna take me on?

37:33.876 --> 37:35.627
Hurry.

37:40.007 --> 37:42.092
It's not only James's head
I can get inside.

37:47.473 --> 37:48.515
Dean.

38:00.819 --> 38:02.780
Sam!

38:04.281 --> 38:06.825
Agh! Unh!

38:49.910 --> 38:51.370
Kids, don't try this at home.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.133
You sure you don't wanna stay
and fight this?

39:05.342 --> 39:06.802
Look, we can help you.

39:07.010 --> 39:08.679
Spencer was right.

39:09.805 --> 39:12.516
Ed Stoltz has built enough
of a case against me...

39:12.724 --> 39:16.311
...to make life hell for a long time.

39:17.020 --> 39:19.356
And the community here
wants no part of us.

39:21.441 --> 39:23.819
We start over. We're used to it.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.947
It's the way it's always been.

39:27.155 --> 39:28.240
For all of us.

39:30.826 --> 39:32.703
I'll miss you.

39:34.621 --> 39:35.873
Maybe even you.

39:37.499 --> 39:38.750
I like dogs.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.962
No, you really don't.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.783
It's possible I was wrong.

40:12.492 --> 40:16.163
What, about James?
Dude, we were both ready to gank the guy.

40:17.623 --> 40:19.333
No, that's not what I meant.

40:21.209 --> 40:24.838
Back there, when Spencer had us.

40:25.047 --> 40:27.424
He screwed with my head.

40:27.633 --> 40:28.967
I saw Mom.

40:31.053 --> 40:33.055
When she died.

40:33.805 --> 40:35.849
And some other crap.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.436
Me too.

40:42.022 --> 40:44.608
When I look back at
what our family has been through...

40:44.816 --> 40:46.902
...what everybody has been through...

40:47.110 --> 40:50.864
...seeing all that pain...

40:52.574 --> 40:56.745
...I realize that the only way we've made
it through it all was by hanging together.

41:00.415 --> 41:03.210
I trust you, Sammy.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.463
And with this deal...

41:06.672 --> 41:09.967
...locking those sons of bitches up
in the furnace once and for all...

41:10.175 --> 41:11.593
...it's too important not to.

41:13.512 --> 41:17.140
So if you say you're good...

41:19.267 --> 41:21.770
...then that's it.
I'm with you 100 percent.

41:29.277 --> 41:30.487
I'm good.
