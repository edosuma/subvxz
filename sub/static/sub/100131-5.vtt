WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:03.921
I have been looking for you.

00:04.129 --> 00:07.216
Announce yourselves and the village lives.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.303
<i>The witches have escaped.</i>

00:11.553 --> 00:13.013
<i>A message from Jerlamarel.</i>

00:13.347 --> 00:14.515
It is a message for eyes.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.183
"My dear children,

00:16.850 --> 00:20.395
the river is the first step
of your long journey back to me."

00:20.938 --> 00:21.980
I'm missing something.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.608
<i>Something very important to me.
We have to get it back.</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:26.985
I think I know who took our things.
Look.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.155
There are new whispers about you.

00:30.239 --> 00:33.116
Who whispers? Lady An? Lord Dune?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.619
Her death must involve no struggle.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.205
No evidence of human hand.

00:38.288 --> 00:42.876
I've decided I won't die for this city.
This city will die for me.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.671
Jerlamarel,
you did not come for me.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.172
So I am coming to you.

01:45.570 --> 01:46.571
<i>Chet-chet!</i>

01:53.662 --> 01:54.663
<i>Chet-chet-chet!</i>

03:20.123 --> 03:21.208
There you are.

03:28.423 --> 03:29.675
Look what happened.

03:31.760 --> 03:32.969
Look what I did.

03:36.223 --> 03:37.808
Your story is over now.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.438
All of you... I ended it.

03:48.193 --> 03:49.861
But mine is just beginning.

03:58.745 --> 03:59.997
Goodbye, Father.

04:01.873 --> 04:05.669
I always loved you...
even if you never did me.

04:08.255 --> 04:09.715
Please, my queen.

04:28.817 --> 04:31.528
God has abandoned us!

04:41.955 --> 04:46.752
We are Payan. We are holy. We are chosen--

04:49.880 --> 04:51.048
Come on, boy.

04:56.678 --> 04:58.263
Okay. Good boy.

05:06.688 --> 05:08.482
The beast has slept for too long.

05:09.733 --> 05:11.108
And now it is awake.

05:19.284 --> 05:20.702
Everything is ahead of us...

05:22.120 --> 05:23.580
everything that matters.

06:10.377 --> 06:11.378
Thank you.

06:14.673 --> 06:15.966
What have I done?

06:17.801 --> 06:19.594
You gave me some time alone.

06:21.179 --> 06:24.641
Resisted the urge to push for answers
you know I can't give.

06:29.563 --> 06:34.735
What could be so important about
some trinkets your father gave you

06:35.402 --> 06:39.656
that you would risk your children's lives,
your husband's life...

06:41.450 --> 06:42.993
just to retrieve it?

06:45.537 --> 06:50.876
I'm sure if there were more to that story
than you've already divulged,

06:51.668 --> 06:54.421
you would've told them
before you would tell me.

06:58.633 --> 07:00.260
I will say, though...

07:01.303 --> 07:04.514
there is a different question...

07:05.724 --> 07:08.435
I have spent the last little while...

07:09.519 --> 07:12.022
unable to silence in my mind.

07:15.317 --> 07:16.693
What question is that?

07:19.488 --> 07:21.448
The day you arrived in our lives...

07:22.991 --> 07:27.329
do you remember the last thing
Jerlamarel said to me as he left?

07:29.206 --> 07:30.207
I don't.

07:32.751 --> 07:36.254
He said, "Be careful."

07:39.257 --> 07:42.928
In that moment, and in every moment since,

07:43.011 --> 07:45.889
I assumed he meant...

07:46.932 --> 07:52.688
"Be careful with this woman I love,
with the children she's soon to bear."

07:55.023 --> 07:57.359
His words have been like a rock to me...

07:59.236 --> 08:03.490
something solid to hang on to
all these years.

08:10.455 --> 08:14.292
But with all that has changed
since we left the waterfall

08:14.376 --> 08:16.628
and set off up this river...

08:18.171 --> 08:22.467
I wonder if I misunderstood what he meant.

08:23.802 --> 08:25.429
What else could he have meant?

08:30.726 --> 08:32.978
Now your husband and children,

08:33.478 --> 08:37.858
they have walked unarmed into
grave danger because you said so.

08:37.941 --> 08:39.651
They hardly hesitated.

08:42.112 --> 08:43.530
Nor did you.

08:48.493 --> 08:53.874
I feel something growing in you
since we started upriver on this journey.

08:57.461 --> 09:02.758
Something in your voice,
in your way, Maghra.

09:04.384 --> 09:06.928
Something formidable.

09:07.888 --> 09:08.889
Something dark.

09:08.972 --> 09:11.975
I am the same person you've known
for almost a lifetime.

09:14.561 --> 09:19.274
I understand your confusion,
and I tolerate your curiosity.

09:19.358 --> 09:23.612
But please do not suggest that my husband
or my children are in grave danger

09:23.695 --> 09:25.989
because of my sinister motives.

09:29.076 --> 09:31.202
Or that I am indifferent to their welfare.

09:44.925 --> 09:46.134
Hold my hand.

09:52.724 --> 09:53.934
Pray with me...

09:56.353 --> 09:59.606
that they'll all come back
safe and unharmed.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.743
These might be tracks here.

10:14.955 --> 10:15.998
Where?

10:22.337 --> 10:23.797
This is ridiculous.

10:37.060 --> 10:38.061
What do you hear?

10:41.523 --> 10:42.524
Nothing.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.571
I hear humming.

10:49.239 --> 10:50.240
Yes.

10:51.658 --> 10:55.579
A bunch of people, and they're humming.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.082
Coming from that way.

11:02.127 --> 11:04.546
Humming? Who's humming?

11:32.991 --> 11:33.992
Humming.

11:44.753 --> 11:45.754
What is this?

11:47.381 --> 11:50.050
Opayol. Scavengers.

12:11.113 --> 12:13.407
There's no one down there.
It looks deserted.

12:14.032 --> 12:15.033
It isn't.

12:15.450 --> 12:17.619
They're about by night,
and they sleep by day.

12:18.161 --> 12:19.663
They're the ones who took our things.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.707
They're most definitely down there.

12:22.290 --> 12:23.917
What I can't say is how many men.

12:24.334 --> 12:27.045
I'm guessing there's a lot more of them
than there are of us.

12:27.129 --> 12:29.006
-Easily.
-We're not turning back.

12:29.089 --> 12:31.800
I'm also guessing
they're a lot less unarmed than we are.

12:31.883 --> 12:33.927
Whatever the significance
of your mother's possessions,

12:34.011 --> 12:36.054
I am certain she would not want
either of you dead over it.

12:36.138 --> 12:37.139
Me too.

12:39.266 --> 12:42.310
But I can get in and out of there
without them even knowing I was there.

12:43.312 --> 12:44.646
No one's going anywhere alone.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.064
I have to go alone.

12:46.982 --> 12:48.692
I'm least likely to get caught that way.

12:50.694 --> 12:52.279
I can slip in and out.

12:52.362 --> 12:54.448
You said so yourself,
they're probably asleep.

12:54.865 --> 12:57.200
But if you wake one of 'em,
the other ones will come out quickly.

12:57.284 --> 12:58.618
Then I'll avoid them.

13:01.204 --> 13:03.707
Mama knew how difficult
it would be to find this,

13:03.790 --> 13:05.334
and she's asked us anyway.

13:06.668 --> 13:09.755
Are we saying that we don't trust her
to understand what that means?

13:10.297 --> 13:12.758
Are we saying we think she's incapable
of making that kind of decision?

13:12.841 --> 13:13.925
Okay.

13:16.678 --> 13:17.721
Okay.

13:19.056 --> 13:20.849
You're both right here.

13:20.932 --> 13:22.476
I'll call out if I need help.

13:24.436 --> 13:25.771
But I have to try.

14:02.557 --> 14:05.602
This is a terrible idea.

14:06.937 --> 14:08.563
No, we should've stopped her.

14:09.356 --> 14:10.357
How?

14:11.525 --> 14:13.443
She would've done this for any one of us.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.405
She would not have been stopped
by any one of us.

14:18.156 --> 14:20.909
Honestly, I don't think this
has anything to do with us.

14:21.535 --> 14:24.121
I think the moment that Mom
mentioned her father,

14:24.538 --> 14:25.831
her connection to him,

14:26.581 --> 14:28.375
Haniwa's decision was made.

14:29.292 --> 14:33.547
You know, there wasn't even a decision
to be made. It was unavoidable.

14:59.114 --> 15:01.950
The idea of an absent father,

15:02.034 --> 15:03.577
the chance to reconnect,

15:03.660 --> 15:04.786
it was just...

15:05.871 --> 15:07.372
It was too much for her.

16:39.297 --> 16:41.258
And I'm just afraid that
there's not gonna be--

16:42.342 --> 16:43.510
Oh, no.

16:43.593 --> 16:44.761
Haniwa!

16:59.735 --> 17:00.736
Haniwa!

17:05.157 --> 17:07.200
Haniwa. Haniwa.

17:12.289 --> 17:13.749
-Is she still breathing?
-Yeah.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.917
-Where's she hurt?
-I can't see.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.419
Dad!

17:38.690 --> 17:40.692
Wait. No. Wait. No, no!

18:06.968 --> 18:09.971
No. Stop. Stop! You don't know who he is!

18:10.055 --> 18:11.263
I don't care who he is!

18:11.682 --> 18:13.308
His chest.

18:14.393 --> 18:15.394
Look. Feel. Feel.

18:23.110 --> 18:24.903
Get up. Get up.

18:29.533 --> 18:30.742
He can see.

19:04.151 --> 19:05.485
So empty here.

19:11.742 --> 19:14.036
I was born into the sound
of the engines...

19:16.580 --> 19:19.458
thunder, power...

19:21.376 --> 19:22.377
meaning.

19:24.379 --> 19:26.465
I spent my entire life bathed in it.

19:29.509 --> 19:33.555
Never ventured far enough from the capital
that I couldn't hear it.

19:35.599 --> 19:39.770
I always wondered what the world would
sound like if I'd ventured a little...

19:40.562 --> 19:41.605
further.

19:43.815 --> 19:47.277
Turns out, sounds like nothing at all.

19:48.445 --> 19:50.030
How unbelievably boring.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.534
Listen to the water, my queen.

19:59.456 --> 20:00.540
And the wind.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.961
And perhaps if you listen,
it might whisper its secrets to you.

20:09.716 --> 20:11.259
There are no secrets here.

20:13.095 --> 20:14.888
No information being bargained.

20:15.472 --> 20:17.140
No stories being woven.

20:17.891 --> 20:20.519
No strength, no fear.

20:22.145 --> 20:23.146
Nothing.

20:24.982 --> 20:27.567
Is this really how people
go about their lives...

20:28.527 --> 20:31.321
in the absence of anything
of any importance?

20:33.740 --> 20:35.575
I suppose so, Your Majesty.

20:39.329 --> 20:40.747
This journey may require it,

20:40.831 --> 20:43.542
but I don't think I'll be very good
at being that person.

20:45.127 --> 20:48.296
I don't believe there's even the smallest
part of me that is built for it.

20:51.508 --> 20:52.592
I'm hungry.

21:17.868 --> 21:19.119
I'm hungry!

21:19.661 --> 21:21.371
I'm ready to take my dinner.

21:22.331 --> 21:24.416
Did you find eggs? 'Tis the season.

21:29.046 --> 21:30.130
Driver?

21:32.007 --> 21:34.384
I hear the fire dying. Did you find food?

21:34.468 --> 21:36.136
Driver, where are you?

21:42.726 --> 21:45.479
Save the fire.
It's choking on its own smoke.

21:48.106 --> 21:49.232
Driver?

21:53.654 --> 21:56.323
Driver? Fucking answer me.

22:35.529 --> 22:36.738
Nyrie!

22:40.492 --> 22:41.702
Nyrie!

23:24.161 --> 23:25.370
Nyrie.

23:27.873 --> 23:29.916
Nyrie!

23:30.625 --> 23:32.252
I have whatever you want.

23:32.669 --> 23:36.590
I have whatever you want.
I have rings. I have God bone.

23:36.673 --> 23:38.383
So soft.

23:38.842 --> 23:40.385
Exquisite fingers.

23:40.469 --> 23:41.678
No rings.

23:43.263 --> 23:44.514
No God bone.

23:46.391 --> 23:47.601
We take you.

23:51.104 --> 23:52.189
Nyrie?

23:54.608 --> 23:58.028
Nyrie!

24:02.741 --> 24:04.076
Mama, it's us.

24:04.159 --> 24:05.160
Haniwa.

24:08.455 --> 24:09.498
Come.

24:13.126 --> 24:14.753
Did you find it?

24:19.383 --> 24:20.759
Thank you.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.350
I count four.

24:30.018 --> 24:32.312
Who is our new friend?

24:34.564 --> 24:35.857
They call him Boots.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.485
Raccoon hides.

24:40.612 --> 24:42.906
This is the creature who took our things.

24:42.990 --> 24:43.991
Yes.

24:45.367 --> 24:48.286
But he didn't know who we were,
and he didn't have a choice.

24:49.454 --> 24:51.039
Let me explain, please.

24:54.459 --> 24:55.502
All right.

25:05.262 --> 25:07.055
When Jerlamarel left us,

25:07.681 --> 25:11.393
left us to go to the House of
Enlightenment as he promised...

25:12.936 --> 25:14.938
it seems he didn't go there directly.

25:15.814 --> 25:17.566
He made a stop for the winter.

25:19.609 --> 25:21.987
He approached the Opayol.

25:23.322 --> 25:24.906
He lived among them for a year.

25:25.991 --> 25:27.117
A year?

25:29.286 --> 25:32.831
But... once his child was born...

25:34.249 --> 25:35.751
he resumed his journey.

25:37.377 --> 25:39.963
Boots is that child.

25:41.631 --> 25:43.383
Boots is Jerlamarel's son.

25:44.801 --> 25:45.844
Our brother.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.729
After Jerlamarel continued his journey...

25:57.648 --> 26:00.651
the Opayol treated Boots like a slave.

26:02.069 --> 26:05.572
Forced him to scavenge and steal for them.

26:06.323 --> 26:10.202
Once word came that the Witchfinder
was campaigning through this area,

26:10.285 --> 26:12.663
the Opayol left to seek safety elsewhere.

26:12.746 --> 26:15.165
And they abandoned him here
to fend for himself.

26:15.248 --> 26:17.834
Child! Child!

26:20.504 --> 26:22.881
Are you suggesting
we bring him along with us?

26:22.964 --> 26:24.132
Yes.

26:26.718 --> 26:30.430
Aside from offering him a way out
of being treated like an animal...

26:31.723 --> 26:34.851
aside from him being an asset to us,
a skilled fighter...

26:34.935 --> 26:36.144
He can see.

26:37.896 --> 26:38.981
Can't he?

26:42.359 --> 26:44.194
Yes, he can see.

26:46.655 --> 26:49.616
You two, you are in agreement?

26:51.660 --> 26:53.161
Why is everyone being like this?

26:54.371 --> 26:56.707
He is family.
We're not leaving him behind.

26:57.833 --> 27:00.085
I've asked all the same questions
you have.

27:01.211 --> 27:02.963
I have expressed the same concerns.

27:03.046 --> 27:04.089
And?

27:05.882 --> 27:08.385
And if I was gonna forbid this
from happening, Paris,

27:08.927 --> 27:10.929
I imagine you would have
heard me do it by now.

27:11.013 --> 27:12.139
Don't you?

27:15.058 --> 27:16.852
What else do you know about him?

27:17.853 --> 27:20.105
Aside from his skill as a thief.

27:22.399 --> 27:23.900
Do you trust him?

27:25.986 --> 27:32.617
I have never had anyone to look after me
as you do for each other.

27:33.452 --> 27:34.995
To be a part of that,

27:35.579 --> 27:37.831
I will do whatever it is you ask of me.

27:46.548 --> 27:47.841
Then let him come.

27:49.885 --> 27:55.140
Let us begin to build for ourselves
an army of the sighted...

27:56.350 --> 27:59.770
so long as its newest recruits are willing
to swear their allegiance

27:59.853 --> 28:02.564
to the only general we have amongst us.

28:03.315 --> 28:04.316
I swear it.

28:06.026 --> 28:08.904
No. Show us.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.191
Such a perfect day.

28:50.362 --> 28:55.742
Your total silence I find far more
interesting than her total silence.

29:02.416 --> 29:06.461
You know, I will be there
when they slit your throats,

29:06.962 --> 29:10.215
reminding you what a fucking mistake
you made today.

29:22.853 --> 29:25.147
Too many times separating from you...

29:26.231 --> 29:27.941
and worrying it'll be our last.

29:29.818 --> 29:31.611
Let's never do it again.

29:41.204 --> 29:43.081
I never told you much about him...

29:45.042 --> 29:46.418
about my father.

29:48.378 --> 29:49.796
I never asked you to.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.507
It's never mattered to me
where you come from.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.218
I know. Nor I you.

29:58.347 --> 30:00.349
He gave this to me the day he died.

30:01.808 --> 30:04.394
Been in his family for as long
as he could remember.

30:05.562 --> 30:06.647
Open it.

30:14.988 --> 30:16.615
All of that for this.

30:20.077 --> 30:21.703
Must've loved him very much.

30:22.371 --> 30:23.914
He was a very good man.

30:24.498 --> 30:26.667
Kind, wise.

30:30.045 --> 30:31.755
I think he would've liked you.

30:33.590 --> 30:35.217
Let's not get carried away.

30:40.597 --> 30:41.890
I wish I'd known him.

30:44.518 --> 30:46.645
Perhaps you can tell me
more about him sometime.

30:48.522 --> 30:49.940
I think I'd like that.

30:56.405 --> 30:57.614
Kofun is right.

30:59.157 --> 31:00.575
I should get moving.

31:01.743 --> 31:02.995
Of course.

31:03.537 --> 31:06.081
That boy, Boots...

31:07.290 --> 31:08.959
you don't trust him, do you?

31:12.254 --> 31:14.881
I haven't planned on trusting anyone new
for a while.

31:15.674 --> 31:16.717
I see.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.553
Then why did you choose to allow it?

31:22.097 --> 31:23.974
I'm flattered you thought I have
any choice in the matter.

31:24.057 --> 31:25.350
I'm being serious.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.894
-I know.
-Why didn't you forbid it?

31:35.319 --> 31:36.903
'Cause at the end of this journey...

31:39.364 --> 31:40.949
they will meet a new father.

31:43.577 --> 31:46.121
And I can't give them any new reason
to want one.

31:50.292 --> 31:52.377
Kofun understands our choices.

31:52.961 --> 31:54.171
He always has.

31:55.172 --> 31:56.715
Doesn't take them personally.

32:00.510 --> 32:01.595
But her...

32:07.726 --> 32:09.144
I don't wanna lose her.

32:12.439 --> 32:13.649
You won't.

32:24.451 --> 32:25.494
Yes.

32:47.140 --> 32:48.225
Love you.

33:06.576 --> 33:09.162
They don't like me, do they?

33:12.666 --> 33:13.875
They're scared...

33:14.876 --> 33:16.086
and confused.

33:16.628 --> 33:19.548
But they're good people.
They'll come around.

33:20.507 --> 33:21.717
Do they like you?

33:23.385 --> 33:24.511
What did you say?

33:24.928 --> 33:26.346
They yell at you.

33:26.430 --> 33:28.432
They question you, make you feel small.

33:29.599 --> 33:31.935
That is how my people always treated me.

33:39.234 --> 33:40.986
Why did they make you wear the mask?

33:43.989 --> 33:45.991
They said I was not like them.

33:46.533 --> 33:49.911
Not a man, but something else.

33:50.787 --> 33:52.539
They said the mask would remind me.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.797
My family loves me.

34:02.924 --> 34:04.634
They don't always understand.

34:06.053 --> 34:10.891
But I have never doubted
for one moment that they love me.

34:17.981 --> 34:21.610
How you've been treated, it was wrong.

34:22.569 --> 34:24.154
You deserve better than that.

34:26.114 --> 34:27.532
But I promise...

34:28.825 --> 34:30.327
you're one of us now.

34:31.411 --> 34:33.413
You'll never be treated that way again.

34:40.003 --> 34:41.463
Your mother.

34:43.006 --> 34:45.717
Do you think she will have room
to love another child

34:45.801 --> 34:47.594
as she already loves you and your brother?

34:57.688 --> 34:59.314
That may take some time.

35:01.108 --> 35:03.651
This is complicated for her.

35:06.697 --> 35:07.698
But...

35:09.616 --> 35:13.328
my mother has the biggest heart
of anyone I've ever met.

35:15.539 --> 35:16.832
She does what's right.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.377
She always does what's right.

35:36.267 --> 35:39.812
-Why did you keep your secret for so long?
-How do you do that?

35:40.772 --> 35:41.898
Do what?

35:42.316 --> 35:45.026
Sneak up on people who can see you
sneaking up on people.

35:46.194 --> 35:49.613
I wasn't trying to be sneaky.
Maybe you just weren't paying attention.

35:53.660 --> 35:55.078
Will you answer my question?

35:55.954 --> 35:57.247
What are you talking about?

35:57.789 --> 35:58.874
What secret?

36:03.253 --> 36:06.631
You kept it for so long,
you don't even know it's a secret anymore.

36:10.510 --> 36:12.471
Why did no one in the Alkenny know...

36:15.265 --> 36:16.558
that you could see?

36:17.434 --> 36:20.270
Well, given how everyone else reacted
when the Witchfinder turned up,

36:20.354 --> 36:21.813
I think my parents were probably wise

36:21.897 --> 36:24.107
to not trust them
with that piece of information.

36:34.701 --> 36:37.120
Baba and Maghra were stuck in the Alkenny.

36:38.413 --> 36:40.916
And I guess they kept a secret
to protect you two.

36:41.750 --> 36:43.460
Something like that, yes.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.507
Can I tell you what it's like
to observe people

36:48.590 --> 36:50.509
that don't know that
you're observing them?

36:59.101 --> 37:01.144
They are completely vulnerable to you.

37:03.438 --> 37:05.315
You could keep their secrets.

37:05.399 --> 37:07.442
You could spread them to their enemies.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.404
You could strike at them...

37:11.780 --> 37:13.865
without them ever knowing who did it,

37:14.783 --> 37:17.536
or how, or why.

37:19.913 --> 37:22.249
You could change their life.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.168
Could end their life...

37:27.713 --> 37:28.922
for any reason...

37:30.257 --> 37:31.633
or no reason at all.

37:33.593 --> 37:35.137
That is what gods do.

37:37.597 --> 37:39.057
You might not know what this feels like

37:39.141 --> 37:42.394
because you never made the choice
to hold that power over others.

37:42.477 --> 37:45.731
It was made for you by your parents.

37:49.484 --> 37:50.569
But I know.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.660
And I suspect Jerlamarel knew, too.

38:03.415 --> 38:06.043
For me,
it brought me closer to those I shadowed.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.379
For Jerlamarel...

38:11.506 --> 38:15.177
he fathered a child among them
and abandoned him.

38:15.802 --> 38:18.347
So, what does any of this
have to do with you, anyway?

38:19.890 --> 38:23.352
Maybe I find it amusing that you can see
and still observe so little.

38:39.951 --> 38:41.161
Where am I?

38:41.662 --> 38:43.163
The City of Worms.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.795
Where am I?

39:08.021 --> 39:09.356
My friends.

39:10.899 --> 39:12.526
What have you brought me?

39:13.276 --> 39:15.737
I have a horse. It needs water.

39:15.821 --> 39:18.657
And I'm tired. I need to sleep.

39:19.074 --> 39:20.283
I've ridden all day.

39:20.367 --> 39:22.828
I need oil for my ass
and a maid to apply it.

39:22.911 --> 39:24.913
After I've slept, I will speak to you.

39:24.997 --> 39:26.331
You've made a mistake--

39:39.428 --> 39:41.304
Exquisite fingers.

39:43.473 --> 39:47.686
You have done well. Thank you for this.
She will be... perfect.

39:51.690 --> 39:54.276
A silkworm is a fascinating creature.

39:55.569 --> 39:56.862
Would you like to know why?

39:59.281 --> 40:03.869
She begins so small, so innocent,
unassuming.

40:04.369 --> 40:07.164
But in the course of her very short life,

40:07.247 --> 40:10.334
she creates a substance of such beauty,
such perfection,

40:10.417 --> 40:12.878
that the wealthiest men in the world,

40:12.961 --> 40:16.214
men who could dress themselves,
their wives, their concubines,

40:16.298 --> 40:18.717
in whatever they desire,

40:19.259 --> 40:22.137
choose... this.

40:23.305 --> 40:27.267
And when her life has run its course,
her usefulness expired,

40:27.809 --> 40:32.189
she spends her final days sadly grotesque.

40:33.106 --> 40:36.652
A winged creature with the urge to fly

40:37.110 --> 40:38.945
but denied that ability.

40:40.155 --> 40:42.616
A husk of herself, used up,

40:43.408 --> 40:45.577
eager for death.

40:47.579 --> 40:49.539
You will come to know her well here.

40:50.540 --> 40:53.919
You will come to understand her.

40:55.796 --> 40:59.800
My friend, you do not want me in here.

41:01.551 --> 41:03.387
I haven't met a worm in my life.

41:05.764 --> 41:09.518
Yeah. Perhaps for a time, it'll amuse you.

41:12.479 --> 41:15.691
But soon you will regret it!

41:31.289 --> 41:32.541
Is that so?

41:34.292 --> 41:37.629
I wonder who you might be
to make such a claim.

41:39.756 --> 41:42.551
Delicate hands unused to being worked.

41:42.634 --> 41:45.387
An impudent mouth unused to being struck.

41:46.346 --> 41:47.723
A woman of wealth...

41:48.974 --> 41:53.395
accustomed to wielding authority
or the authority of a husband, perhaps.

41:54.688 --> 41:57.858
But from where?

42:02.863 --> 42:07.075
The Witchfinder's campaign
brought him through here not long ago.

42:07.743 --> 42:09.745
When he was asking for information,

42:10.662 --> 42:14.791
his accent reminded me of the time
I spent in Kanzua,

42:14.875 --> 42:19.671
selling our goods to the high-born
with money to burn.

42:22.090 --> 42:26.094
Your accent brings back
those same memories.

42:31.099 --> 42:33.769
You were a noblewoman, I presume.

42:35.187 --> 42:38.482
Perhaps even a councilor
to that bitch queen.

42:40.817 --> 42:41.943
But no matter.

42:42.569 --> 42:45.989
Here you will be the same as the rest,
or even less so, perhaps,

42:46.073 --> 42:49.201
as everything must be learned
from the beginning.

42:49.993 --> 42:52.412
If you work hard for me,
you will live well.

42:52.496 --> 42:56.375
If you try to escape, you will not
get far, and the consequences will be...

42:58.043 --> 42:59.169
unpleasant.

43:00.921 --> 43:02.589
You are an interesting one.

43:03.715 --> 43:08.136
I look forward to whatever time
we are able to spend together here.

43:13.725 --> 43:14.851
Hear me...

43:16.103 --> 43:17.270
Jerlamarel.

43:18.981 --> 43:19.982
Jerlamarel.

43:20.816 --> 43:21.900
Kofun?

43:22.651 --> 43:24.861
Yeah. Here, Dad.

43:25.404 --> 43:26.613
Is the boat free?

43:27.781 --> 43:30.409
It's unmoored, but it's stuck.

43:30.826 --> 43:32.703
What do you mean "stuck"? Stuck where?

43:33.036 --> 43:34.329
Tide's gone out.

43:38.291 --> 43:39.376
What are we gonna do?

43:46.008 --> 43:47.676
We're gonna have to wait till morning.

44:26.882 --> 44:27.966
Come.

44:29.968 --> 44:31.011
Run.

44:31.428 --> 44:32.429
Come.

44:34.181 --> 44:35.182
Run.

45:12.094 --> 45:13.720
They can't ride through this, can they?

45:13.804 --> 45:16.264
They can. But it'll slow them down.

45:26.984 --> 45:28.151
I hear them.

45:30.570 --> 45:31.863
-Haniwa.
-Yes.

45:33.031 --> 45:35.534
Take your mother and Paris
and find shelter for them.

45:36.451 --> 45:37.869
I love you. Go. Go.

45:45.460 --> 45:46.670
They're everywhere.

45:50.590 --> 45:52.592
Dad, I'll stand with you.

45:54.886 --> 45:56.513
Yes, you will, son.

46:18.618 --> 46:19.911
Stay here.

46:23.248 --> 46:24.666
Everything will be all right.

48:26.997 --> 48:27.998
Maghra?

48:29.875 --> 48:30.876
Maghra?

48:34.755 --> 48:36.340
Baba Voss!

48:44.348 --> 48:45.390
Where's Mama? What happened?

48:45.474 --> 48:47.142
-She's gone.
-Haniwa!

48:48.268 --> 48:49.353
-Haniwa.
-No.

48:49.436 --> 48:52.314
Baba, I had her by the hand.

48:52.397 --> 48:53.398
They took her?

48:53.482 --> 48:55.984
No, she let go of my hand.

48:56.401 --> 49:01.281
She whispered to me.
She said, "Be careful."

49:04.368 --> 49:05.369
Mama?

49:08.538 --> 49:09.998
Mama!

49:21.885 --> 49:23.387
Tamacti Jun!

49:30.102 --> 49:33.730
Do you hear my voice, Witchfinder?

49:38.276 --> 49:39.486
Do you hear me?

49:57.421 --> 49:58.547
Speak.

50:01.216 --> 50:02.426
Witchfinder...

50:05.137 --> 50:06.304
can you hear me?

50:08.181 --> 50:10.976
I hear the voice of a dead woman.

50:12.060 --> 50:13.687
Then listen closer.

50:50.474 --> 50:51.808
Take my hand.

50:59.775 --> 51:00.942
And speak.

51:01.860 --> 51:02.944
Hail...

51:04.529 --> 51:06.156
Princess Maghra...

51:08.492 --> 51:13.205
of the House... of Kane.

51:25.842 --> 51:27.594
Give homage!
