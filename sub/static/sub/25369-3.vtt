<i>When life as Peter Parker</i>

00:05.172 --> 00:07.007

00:09.092 --> 00:10.969
There he is,
that menace.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.554
Is he really that bad?

00:12.554 --> 00:14.097
Haven't you seen
the <i>Daily Bugle?</i>

00:14.097 --> 00:16.099
He's dangerous, reckless.

00:17.309 --> 00:20.187
And sometimes not so much.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.814
<i>[Jameson]</i>
<i>Look how much damage</i>
<i>Spider‐Man has caused!</i>

00:22.814 --> 00:25.734
<i>He calls himself a hero?</i>
<i>I only see a menace.</i>

00:25.734 --> 00:28.487
Not only is J. Jonah Jameson
at the <i>Daily Bugle</i>

00:28.487 --> 00:30.155
making me look bad,

00:30.155 --> 00:31.615
I'm the genius
who sold him that footage

00:31.615 --> 00:32.950
for tuition money.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.618
Time to get some video

00:34.618 --> 00:37.412
that'll be impossible
for J. J. J. to use against me.

00:37.412 --> 00:40.707
Hero time USA.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.251
Stopping jewelry thieves‐‐
Whoa!

00:42.251 --> 00:43.961
Crime Fighting 101.

00:43.961 --> 00:47.506
Cut! Who let this clown
on set?

00:47.506 --> 00:50.175
My agent will hear about this!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.468
I'm gonna say it!
I'm gonna say it!

00:51.468 --> 00:54.972
Saving this building
is dynamite! Hah!

00:57.766 --> 01:00.143
Oh, great. It only
took me three hours

01:00.143 --> 01:01.770
to do the wiring
on that TNT

01:01.770 --> 01:03.605
for tomorrow's
controlled demolition.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.816
But I love starting over.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.776
That did not
sound sincere.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.988
[sighs] "Delete" button,
you're my new best friend.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.990
I should have had this
camera drone last year,

01:12.990 --> 01:14.157
back in my glory days,

01:14.157 --> 01:15.826
when everyone thought
I was the hero

01:15.826 --> 01:18.203
and Doc Ock‐‐ Huh?‐‐
was the villain?

01:25.252 --> 01:28.171
Hey, Otto. Aren't you supposed
to be a good guy now?

01:28.171 --> 01:31.008
Because here's the thing.
Good guys don't rob banks.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.968
Wait. Hold on.
Who are you?

01:32.968 --> 01:34.803
You're not Doc Ock.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.680
Oh, I know I'm not,

01:36.680 --> 01:39.808
because Octavius
is sheer perfection.

01:39.808 --> 01:43.020
I only dream of achieving
a fraction of his glory.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.648
Okay. Those are the two
craziest sentences

01:46.648 --> 01:48.066
I've ever heard.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.985
But my hero will be so proud

01:49.985 --> 01:53.030
if I eliminate
his peskiest problem.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.241
His personality?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.451
Oh, wait.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.120
You mean me!

02:13.175 --> 02:14.259
Hey!

02:14.259 --> 02:16.136
We just met.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.137
Has no one ever taught you

02:17.137 --> 02:19.056
the importance
of a first impression?

02:20.557 --> 02:21.642
[grunts]

02:21.642 --> 02:23.935
Octavius is the only person

02:23.935 --> 02:25.687
I care about impressing.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.773
And I can't think
of a better way to do that

02:27.773 --> 02:30.025
than by destroying you!

02:31.026 --> 02:32.569
Buy him a gift!

02:32.569 --> 02:33.695
New test tubes,

02:33.695 --> 02:35.238
a better sense of style. Whoa!

02:39.076 --> 02:40.077
[grunts]

02:40.077 --> 02:41.078
Whoa!

02:46.041 --> 02:48.085
Oh! That was so easy.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.127
Yay me.

02:50.212 --> 02:52.255
First,
Spider‐Man is defeated.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.841
Now I get the secret
to unlimited power!

02:54.841 --> 02:56.968
Oh, I knew
I'd be a natural at this.

03:02.224 --> 03:05.143
Money? This is not
what I want!

03:06.812 --> 03:10.023
Then‐‐ news flash‐‐
you shouldn't
have robbed a bank.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.192
The transfer orders I hacked

03:12.192 --> 03:14.778
say the crystals won't be
moved until tomorrow.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.029
Wait.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.741
Oh, no.
I have the dates wrong.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.452
Oh! So humiliating.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.664
You mis‐scheduled
your evil master plan?

03:25.664 --> 03:27.582
I'm a very busy person, okay?

03:27.582 --> 03:29.209
And it's tough
to keep track of things.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.961
Is this your first day
on the job?

03:30.961 --> 03:33.630
Don't insult me!
It's my second.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.799
Now get over here
so I can hit you!

03:35.799 --> 03:37.342
[grunts]
That's not how this works.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.970
Have you ever read
your super villain manual,

03:39.970 --> 03:41.054
Doc‐Not‐Ock?

03:41.054 --> 03:42.931
Hey, what should we call you?

03:42.931 --> 03:44.015
Professor Tentacle?

03:44.015 --> 03:46.017
Oh!
Lab Assistant Lotsa Limbs.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.769
Whatever you're doing, stop!

03:47.769 --> 03:49.438
Oh! Delightful.

03:49.438 --> 03:52.149
[singsong]
Your timing could not
be more perfect.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.108
[yells]

03:53.108 --> 03:55.402
Uhh! Yaah!
Huhh!

03:58.780 --> 03:59.948
She's gone.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.033
Is that Doc Ock's girlfriend?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.327
Maybe it was
just his sister.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.829
No clue who she was,

04:05.829 --> 04:07.831
but she was looking
for some kind of crystals.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.167
Sure. That quartz
cluster we had.

04:10.167 --> 04:13.587
Real valuable. But we shipped
it to the docks this morning.

04:16.298 --> 04:20.177
Epic! No way J. J. J. can use
this to make me look bad.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.097
<i>[Jameson]</i>
<i>First he gets beaten.</i>

04:24.097 --> 04:25.724
<i>Then he can't even</i>
<i>help the guards.</i>

04:25.724 --> 04:27.309
<i>Who is this</i>
<i>incompetent buffoon,</i>

04:27.309 --> 04:29.060
<i>and why isn't he</i>
<i>being arrested?</i>

04:29.060 --> 04:30.854
[chatter, snickering]
[girl scoffs]

04:30.854 --> 04:32.647
Spider‐Man should've just
let those guards handle it.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.107
[girl #2]
Seriously.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.193
At least they're trained
to protect people.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.821
[sighs]
How can J. J. J.
keep doing this?

04:39.821 --> 04:41.406
Come on, Pete.
Huh?

04:41.406 --> 04:43.283
We don't want to be late
to Dr. Octavius' class.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.035
He's gonna pick
the project leaders

04:45.035 --> 04:46.161
for the Neuro‐Cortex.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.038
Speaking of Ock,

04:48.038 --> 04:50.123
you'll never believe
what I came across
last night.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.460
It was a‐‐
A woman using
octopus arms?

04:53.460 --> 04:56.296
Yeah. Sure seemed
like your kind of gear.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.298
Mine? No, no.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.926
That tech is clearly
an inferior knockoff.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.803
Look at the‐‐ Oh.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.055
Wait. I recognize her.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.473
Carolyn Trainer.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.058
She was in the cell
next to mine

05:08.058 --> 05:10.477
when I was being
criminally rehabilitated.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.395
Has she tried
to contact you?

05:12.395 --> 05:13.939
Oh, heavens, no.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.358
Let us just say
I feared her release

05:16.358 --> 05:18.193
would lead to something
like this.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.736
Would it be a problem

05:19.736 --> 05:21.696
if we need to contact you
for more information?

05:21.696 --> 05:22.989
Of course not.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.950
I hope you can help
that poor woman

05:24.950 --> 05:26.952
and keep her very far
away from me.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.287
I am working diligently
to start a new life,

05:29.287 --> 05:31.331
and do not need
hangers‐on.
[bell rings]

05:31.331 --> 05:34.042
Uh, are we sure
that isn't an Ock clone

05:34.042 --> 05:35.961
with all the Ock removed?

05:35.961 --> 05:39.172
He's taking this
"turning over a new leaf"
thing very seriously.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.174
I'm surprised he hasn't
started opening classes

05:41.174 --> 05:42.717
with group hugs.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.763
I'd like to begin
today's lecture

05:46.763 --> 05:48.557
with a group hug.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.600
[students laugh]

05:50.600 --> 05:52.060
You're probably wondering

05:52.060 --> 05:55.313
why I'm trying this
looser lecture format.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.691
Well, in order
to properly grasp

05:57.691 --> 05:59.776
the science
behind the Neuro‐Cortex,

05:59.776 --> 06:03.488
I've designed our classroom
to be more spontaneous

06:03.488 --> 06:05.407
and random.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.033
Mr. Octavius?

06:07.033 --> 06:08.285
Call me Otto.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.203
And there is no need
to raise your hand.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.413
Just speak out.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.206
Um, Otto,

06:13.206 --> 06:14.916
sitting on the floor
doesn't seem

06:14.916 --> 06:16.877
like what professional
scientists would do.

06:16.877 --> 06:20.046
True, Anya, but our goal
is to break the mold.

06:20.046 --> 06:24.009
This format is a mirror
to how the human mind
itself operates.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.469
But you had the courage
to question me.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.346
Good.
That's one of the reasons

06:28.346 --> 06:30.390
I'm picking you
to be one of the leaders

06:30.390 --> 06:33.101
of our three Neuro‐Cortex
development teams,

06:33.101 --> 06:34.853
along with Gwen and Miles.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.771
Our first meeting
is this evening.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.607
Of course,
there will be a chance

06:38.607 --> 06:41.568
for everyone to contribute
to the Neuro‐Cortex.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.195
My intention
is for all students,

06:44.195 --> 06:46.281
no matter their skill level,

06:46.281 --> 06:47.657
to feel involved.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.411
A development leader
for the Neuro‐Cortex?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.038
This is huge.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.290
This could set me on track
for top colleges.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.625
I'm thrilled for you.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.251
Oh.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.961
Sorry, Pete.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.338
I wish
you got picked, too.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.672
We'd have a blast.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.299
I can't blame Ock.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.052
I haven't been focusing
on school like I should.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.511
All I was thinking about
during class

07:08.511 --> 07:10.138
was finding Carolyn Trainer.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.475
You got to find a better
school‐life balance, buddy.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.102
Tell you what. After
the Neuro‐Cortex meeting,

07:16.102 --> 07:17.354
I'll help you
track her down.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.272
Deal?
Deal.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.191
Thanks, Miles.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.525
[Peter]
Can we talk, Mr. Jameson?

07:22.525 --> 07:24.069
In 11 seconds, kid.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.571
The footage I gave you
of Spider‐Man.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.073
You're not being
truthful with it.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.074
He's a hero.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.575
You see a hero,

07:30.575 --> 07:33.119
I see a masked vigilante
with no skills,

07:33.119 --> 07:34.079
who doesn't
answer to anyone.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.164
Iron Man, Captain America‐‐

07:36.164 --> 07:38.083
now, those are real heroes.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.126
We know their names.
We know where they live.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.711
Why does Spider‐Man
wear a mask?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.171
Who is he? What's he hiding?

07:43.171 --> 07:44.506
Maybe he's a‐‐

07:44.506 --> 07:47.092
well, trying to protect
his family or something.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.343
Weak excuse.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.095
The public needs
to wake up to the truth

07:50.095 --> 07:51.930
about this costumed menace,

07:51.930 --> 07:54.349
and I'm just the man
to make that happen.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.101
Then...

07:56.101 --> 07:57.977
I can't sell you
any more footage.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.729
Ha. Your choice, kid.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.023
You don't do it, I'll find
somebody else who will.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.566
You know where the door is.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.529
[Spider‐Man]
Hey, Miles.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.571
I tracked those crystals

08:08.571 --> 08:09.572
Carolyn Trainer was looking for

08:09.572 --> 08:11.199
to a warehouse by the river.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.159
But I've been
staking it out for hours,

08:13.159 --> 08:14.202
and she's a no‐show.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.787
I wouldn't bother coming.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.163
Looks like this is a bust.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.582
Whoa! I lied!

08:19.582 --> 08:22.168
Hello, little bug.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.045
I was hoping
we'd meet again

08:24.045 --> 08:28.508
so I could make you
pay for your crimes
against Ock's genius!

08:30.051 --> 08:31.928
You have the worst
social skills.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.097
Ah‐ah‐ah! Not so.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.808
Look how many friends
I've made.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.102
Okay, I admit
I made them in my workshop,

08:39.102 --> 08:41.146
but that still counts, right?

08:41.146 --> 08:43.314
Octobots, attack!

08:43.314 --> 08:44.983
[grunting]

08:47.610 --> 08:50.989
Ow! Aren't you supposed to keep
dangerous pets on a leash?

08:50.989 --> 08:53.199
Leash these little cuties?

08:53.199 --> 08:55.160
Aw, no way.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.953
And get this.
I programmed them

08:56.953 --> 08:59.080
with Ock's
superior tactics.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.749
[giggles]
It's almost like fighting

09:00.749 --> 09:02.876
with the original
Doc Ock, right?

09:02.876 --> 09:05.503
Only they
aren't constantly talking
about how smart they are.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.089
Ha! Otto does do that.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.634
I love it. He's so
unhindered by modesty.

09:11.634 --> 09:15.221
Play nice while Mommy
acquires the stolen goods.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.514
[Spider‐Man grunting]

09:19.517 --> 09:22.228
Wait.
You guys do teamwork?

09:22.228 --> 09:24.272
That's nothing like
the original Doc Ock!

09:28.526 --> 09:30.695
Oh, my, Octobots.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.864
[grunts]
What big teeth you have.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.040
How about you chew on this?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.710
Face it, web‐head,

09:45.710 --> 09:48.046
now that there's
a whole Ock family,

09:48.046 --> 09:50.256
you're all washed up.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.383
"Washed up"?
What do you mean by‐‐

09:52.383 --> 09:55.136
Aah!
[grunts]

09:55.136 --> 09:56.888
Whaah!

09:56.888 --> 09:59.265
[laughing]

10:02.227 --> 10:04.813
I am so glad no one
was there to see that.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.108
Ohh.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.528
[sighs] I shouldn't have
told you not to come.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.113
I could have used your help.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.405
Did you get my voice mail?

10:14.405 --> 10:16.407
Uh, no. Sorry.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.034
I just went home
and fell asleep.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.828
Brainstorming
on the Neuro‐Cortex

10:19.828 --> 10:22.038
was amazing but exhausting.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.498
I barely remember going home.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.625
I woke up in my clothes.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.668
For real?

10:26.668 --> 10:28.586
Ah, don't worry.
I changed.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.296
Uh, not that.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.966
Carolyn Trainer doesn't
have a criminal record,

10:32.966 --> 10:35.927
but Ock said they had
cells next to each other.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.387
Why would she be behind bars?

10:37.387 --> 10:38.847
She's just a researcher

10:38.847 --> 10:41.015
with a PhD
in electrical engineering.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.393
Having very little
common sense

10:43.393 --> 10:46.479
apparently didn't
stop her from getting
an advanced degree.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.981
Another thing about her‐‐

10:47.981 --> 10:51.317
she buys her Octobot parts
at a hardware store.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.821
I recognize almost all these
components from my projects.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.448
Time for the Spider‐men
to go to work?

10:57.448 --> 11:02.162
Ah, can't. We have another
Neuro‐Cortex development
meeting this afternoon.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.205
But call me
if you need help later.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.498
This time I'll pick up.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.751
Pete, can I have a word?

11:08.751 --> 11:10.461
Hey, Max.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.338
Uh,
is the word "tuition"?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.090
Yeah. Sorry.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.259
I've pushed the board
as far as they can go.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.970
If the office doesn't have
a payment by tomorrow,

11:18.970 --> 11:20.889
they will give your spot
here at Horizon

11:20.889 --> 11:22.182
to someone on the wait list.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.934
I understand.
I'll find a way.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.314
Tony Stark had the right idea.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.901
Become a billionaire,
then become a superhero.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.528
But while I'm trying to find
a way to pay for my tuition,

11:35.528 --> 11:38.489
I might as well find
where Carolyn Trainer
buys her spare parts.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.825
But what am I gonna do,

11:40.825 --> 11:42.160
ask the clerks
if they've ever seen

11:42.160 --> 11:45.038
a bizarre customer
with octopus arms?

11:45.038 --> 11:49.209
Wait. A seafood restaurant
next to a hardware store?

11:49.209 --> 11:50.710
No. She wouldn't.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.879
That would be
way too obvious. Right?

11:55.882 --> 11:57.091
[Carolyn grumbles]

11:57.091 --> 11:59.093
What on earth could that
genius be planning,

11:59.093 --> 12:00.803
you guys?

12:00.803 --> 12:03.014
These crystals appear inert.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.433
I don't yet see what he
could possibly need them for.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.976
And I thought
you were kidding‐‐
Hmm?

12:06.976 --> 12:08.645
...when you said these things
were your friends.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.063
Ugh. Creepy.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.982
Uhh! Oh, you pest!

12:12.982 --> 12:15.360
Octobots, attack!

12:18.029 --> 12:19.864
Listen, guys, pro tip‐‐

12:19.864 --> 12:21.574
when I first got
into villain busting,

12:21.574 --> 12:23.910
I was always
way over my head.
Huh?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.371
But now, as an experienced
second‐year hero,

12:26.371 --> 12:28.039
I've learned
the importance of...

12:31.626 --> 12:32.877
being prepared.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.797
[gasps]
My little Ottos!

12:35.797 --> 12:38.591
What has that maniac
done to you?

12:38.591 --> 12:41.844
You're the one
trying to team up with
a reformed super villain,

12:41.844 --> 12:43.388
but I'm the maniac.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.808
"Reformed"? Ha! As if.

12:46.808 --> 12:50.144
Otto hasn't revealed all
the steps of his plan to me,

12:50.144 --> 12:52.480
but he promised
that if I follow his orders,

12:52.480 --> 12:54.816
we'll rule this city together.

12:54.816 --> 12:55.984
Together.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.694
Have you even met Ock?

12:57.694 --> 13:00.071
Sharing isn't exactly
his strong suit.

13:00.071 --> 13:03.324
Besides, Otto gave your name
to the police.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.368
He's collaborating
with them and not you.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.287
I know that's not true.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.123
Are you suggesting
Otto broke our promise?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.250
Are you calling him a liar?

13:13.209 --> 13:14.627
One of you is lying.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.045
Time to find out which one.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.131
By the way, say hello
to the cops for me.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.465
I'll be sending them
right over.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.930
Fortunately,
it'll be easy to find Ock.

13:25.930 --> 13:29.058
The Neuro‐Cortex Club
is still in session.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.436
Okay. Creepy much?

13:31.436 --> 13:33.313
Locked door, eerie lighting.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.940
What kind of a school
project meeting is this?

13:36.983 --> 13:38.067
What?

13:41.988 --> 13:45.199
<i>[Doc Ock]</i>
<i>I know it might appear</i>
<i>frightening, Spider‐Man,</i>

13:45.199 --> 13:47.785
<i>but that's often what real</i>
<i>progress looks like.</i>

13:47.785 --> 13:51.164
Octavius. What are you doing
to these students?

13:54.542 --> 13:56.878
What I'm doing to them
is irrelevant.

13:56.878 --> 14:01.966
What they are doing for me
will change the world forever.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.427
Your little experiment
ends now.

14:04.427 --> 14:05.845
[grunting]

14:05.845 --> 14:09.557
Whoa!
Do not do that, Spider‐Man!

14:09.557 --> 14:10.975
Wait. How?

14:10.975 --> 14:12.310
I told everyone

14:12.310 --> 14:13.895
the potential
of the Neuro‐Cortex

14:13.895 --> 14:15.021
was limitless,

14:15.021 --> 14:17.190
and behold, it has enabled me

14:17.190 --> 14:20.068
to unlock the most important
force in the world‐‐

14:20.068 --> 14:22.195
my own mind!

14:23.071 --> 14:25.073
Aah!

14:31.037 --> 14:33.122
Didn't know you were
into magic tricks.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.169
How are you doing all this?
Whoa.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.507
Some would call them
telekinetic powers‐‐

14:42.507 --> 14:44.967
mentally manipulating
quantum entanglement.

14:44.967 --> 14:48.137
Einstein called it
"spooky action at a distance."

14:48.137 --> 14:50.431
But I call it the future!

14:52.225 --> 14:54.560
Not one I want to live in.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.563
Did you know that the neurons
in the human brain

14:57.563 --> 15:00.191
can send dozens
of signals per second?

15:00.191 --> 15:03.486
Oh, yeah? Fascinating,
Dr. Irrelevant.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.487
Point?

15:05.863 --> 15:08.074
Uhh!
You are fast, Spider‐Man,

15:08.074 --> 15:10.243
but not faster
than the speed of thought.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.078
The students' brains

15:12.078 --> 15:14.038
are acting
as parallel processors,

15:14.038 --> 15:17.333
helping the Neuro‐Cortex
process quantum software

15:17.333 --> 15:21.129
that pushes my genius
to the very limit!

15:21.129 --> 15:24.048
You can't just use
their neural pathways
like computer circuits.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.633
That could fry their minds.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.218
Aah!
[Gwen screaming]

15:27.218 --> 15:30.054
Aah!
A small sacrifice

15:30.054 --> 15:32.890
to take human existence
to the next level.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.935
The physical shall
limit me no longer.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.395
Yaah!

15:41.440 --> 15:43.734
Those arms were fused to you.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.111
They were impossible
to remove.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.321
Nothing is impossible
to me now.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.991
Max Modell, Norman Osborn‐‐

15:49.991 --> 15:52.702
none of them could see
my true brilliance.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.955
They laughed at me.
Who is laughing now?

15:55.955 --> 15:58.249
Imagine a world
run by my mind.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.376
The perfect world!

16:00.376 --> 16:02.795
You were lying to everybody.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.048
Wait. The wild pack,
Carolyn Trainer.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.967
What about
those stolen crystals?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.302
That was all you?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.679
Hmm. Brilliant, wasn't it?

16:11.679 --> 16:14.182
I played everyone
like chess pieces,

16:14.182 --> 16:16.058
including you.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.692
Carolyn Trainer
was only a tool

16:24.692 --> 16:27.904
keeping you busy while I
reached my true potential.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.325
[grunts]

16:32.325 --> 16:34.285
You used me?

16:34.285 --> 16:36.829
Otto, how could you?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.915
I didn't wind up
in prison by accident.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.208
I hacked the system

16:40.208 --> 16:41.500
and falsified
my own conviction

16:41.500 --> 16:42.585
just to meet you.

16:42.585 --> 16:45.171
You said we would be together!

16:45.171 --> 16:47.798
I did everything
you asked of me!

16:47.798 --> 16:51.552
You served my purpose
for a while, Carolyn.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.680
That is more than most.
Be content with that.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.606
[shouting]

17:03.606 --> 17:04.649
Uhh!

17:10.196 --> 17:11.864
Yaah!

17:11.864 --> 17:12.865
Uhh!
Aah!

17:21.207 --> 17:24.126
Miles.
Tell me you can hear me.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.004
Miles, please.
[grunting]

17:27.004 --> 17:28.172
I need your help!

17:28.172 --> 17:30.341
Gwen! Anya!

17:30.341 --> 17:31.884
Take back control.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.052
You have to fight him.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.013
Aah!

17:37.557 --> 17:39.016
Hah!

17:39.016 --> 17:40.101
Yaah!

17:43.938 --> 17:45.189
What?

17:45.189 --> 17:46.274
Did I do that?

17:46.274 --> 17:47.567
They're fighting back.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.818
[Gwen, Anya, Miles grunting]

17:48.818 --> 17:50.069
Then let's help them.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.071
Now, that's using your brain.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.824
They hit him mentally,
we hit him physically.

17:54.824 --> 17:58.619
How? This is impossible!

17:58.619 --> 18:00.580
Aah!

18:03.207 --> 18:08.129
[slow‐motion screaming]

18:13.426 --> 18:14.552
[man gasps]

18:16.137 --> 18:18.139
This city. Am I right?

18:19.682 --> 18:22.476
They're okay,
just unconscious.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.270
Well, can't say the same
for Otto.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.356
He's alive,
but this is a deep coma.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.653
[siren approaching]
Ohh.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.114
I knew the police
would find me again.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.117
Do you know how hard it was
to escape from them?

18:38.117 --> 18:41.162
No, I don't, but I do know
I couldn't have done this

18:41.162 --> 18:42.747
without your help tonight.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.206
Maybe it's time to admit

18:44.206 --> 18:45.958
you're a terrible
super villain.

18:47.168 --> 18:50.046
Ock was so inspiring.
[sighs]

18:50.046 --> 18:53.549
He made me
feel like I belonged
to something greater.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.718
But it was all a lie.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.432
It's not too late to make
a difference, Carolyn.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.100
If you get a second chance,

19:03.100 --> 19:05.645
don't blow it
like Otto Octavius did.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.155
[groans]

19:16.155 --> 19:18.658
I missed something,
didn't I?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.993
Miles. Pete's been
telling us a story

19:20.993 --> 19:22.536
that's hard to believe.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.413
Doc Ock with
telekinetic powers?

19:24.413 --> 19:25.998
Do you remember
any of this?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.792
No.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.168
I just‐‐

19:29.168 --> 19:31.921
I think I dreamt
about Spider‐Man.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.130
He needed help.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.924
Apparently, he came

19:34.924 --> 19:36.550
to save you guys
from Ock last night,

19:36.550 --> 19:38.719
but you ended up
saving him.

19:38.719 --> 19:42.515
Well, that part
sounds believable.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.184
[laughter]

19:45.184 --> 19:47.103
The three of you
are the lucky ones.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.021
Ock tried to expand his mind,

19:49.021 --> 19:51.732
but it looks like
he overloaded it.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.405
Make sure
you thank Spider‐Man

19:57.405 --> 19:58.823
for letting me
see this.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.450
I'm putting
much stricter safeguards

20:01.450 --> 20:03.119
on the use
of the Neuro‐Cortex.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.746
I never should have
let Otto near it.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.332
To be fair,
Otto had everyone fooled.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.875
But he did prove one thing‐‐

20:09.875 --> 20:11.711
the Neuro‐Cortex
does have potential

20:11.711 --> 20:13.504
for truly amazing things.

20:13.504 --> 20:17.007
Amazing things
I really want you
to be a part of, Peter.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.053
[Jameson]
Ha ha ha ha!

20:21.053 --> 20:22.513
Fantastic, kid.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.223
I'm glad
you changed your mind.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.017
In fact, why don't I
put you on retainer?

20:27.017 --> 20:28.686
Keep bringing me
this kind of material,

20:28.686 --> 20:30.521
and you'll have
a regular job here.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.189
Yes, sir, Mr. Jameson.

20:32.189 --> 20:35.151
Maybe this'll help you
up your game, Brock.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.361
A little competition
from a school kid

20:37.361 --> 20:40.114
could push you
to do some good work
once in a while.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.074
Uh, heh heh.

20:48.456 --> 20:49.874
There you are.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.168
Guys, you shouldn't
have to be the ones

20:52.168 --> 20:53.711
to clean up the lab

20:53.711 --> 20:55.421
where a teacher‐slash‐
super villain went ballistic.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.006
It's what we have to do

20:57.006 --> 20:58.549
if we want to get
back to work.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.843
The Neuro‐Cortex isn't
gonna develop itself.

21:00.843 --> 21:04.597
All right. Well, if this
is where the party is,
then I'll help out.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.725
You have a weird
definition of "party."

21:07.725 --> 21:09.935
It might not be the social
event of the year,

21:09.935 --> 21:12.396
but I'm cool
wherever you guys are.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.024
When I came to Horizon,
I didn't know anyone,

21:15.024 --> 21:18.110
and now I can't imagine
life without you.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.403
I thought you were
here to clean,

21:19.403 --> 21:20.863
not get all sappy
on us.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.449
I'm sorry about
what happened with Otto.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.075
But the good news‐‐

21:25.075 --> 21:27.870
he won't be causing us
any more grief this year.

21:28.913 --> 21:29.955
