00:02.085 --> 00:04.045
WOMAN (over TV):

00:02.085 --> 00:04.045
And what do you think, Scott?

00:04.087 --> 00:06.005
(TV continues quietly)

00:28.529 --> 00:30.990
Give Reese a slice

00:28.529 --> 00:30.990
from the fuzzy side,

00:31.031 --> 00:32.449
and I didn't see a thing.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.450
Deal.

That laptop is so sweet.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.905
I can't believe

01:09.152 --> 01:10.905
you're already upgrading it.

01:10.946 --> 01:13.323
Are you sure your dad will

01:10.946 --> 01:13.323
sell it to me for 300 bucks?

01:13.365 --> 01:16.201
Minus my...

01:13.365 --> 01:16.201
ten percent.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.412
Six months of tutoring kids

01:18.453 --> 01:20.622
who won't even take off

01:18.453 --> 01:20.622
their football helmets.

01:20.664 --> 01:21.498
Once I get

01:21.540 --> 01:23.000
my birthday money,

01:21.540 --> 01:23.000
I'll have it.

01:23.042 --> 01:25.627
You keep... your money...

01:23.042 --> 01:25.627
in a book?

01:25.669 --> 01:26.962
Yeah.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.048
It's the one place no one

01:27.004 --> 01:29.048
in my family will ever look.

01:29.088 --> 01:31.008
Have you seen your brother?

01:29.088 --> 01:31.008
He was supposed to...

01:31.050 --> 01:33.134
(loud grunting)

01:33.176 --> 01:34.177
You...

01:34.219 --> 01:36.055
stupid... kid.

01:36.095 --> 01:38.139
(screaming)

01:40.225 --> 01:41.977
(groaning)

01:42.019 --> 01:43.062
MALCOLM:

01:42.019 --> 01:43.062
You gave me

01:43.102 --> 01:44.145
a black eye, you jerk!

01:44.187 --> 01:45.397
You're going to pay for this.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.982
No one is paying for anything.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.025
You are going to drop this.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.150
Ow!

01:49.192 --> 01:50.151
I'm sick of you two fighting,

01:50.193 --> 01:52.029
and you at least should

01:50.193 --> 01:52.029
know better.

01:52.071 --> 01:53.154
Your birthday is coming up.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.239
I only want money.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.575
If you want anything,

01:54.281 --> 01:56.575
you will not retaliate.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.160
I don't care who started it.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.160
It ends with you.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.454
But he...

01:59.202 --> 02:00.454
With you!

02:00.495 --> 02:02.581
You're just going to let him

02:00.495 --> 02:02.581
have the last licks?

02:02.623 --> 02:03.874
Yes, I am.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.627
Now, get out of my sight,

02:03.916 --> 02:06.627
both of you.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.171
Well... handled.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.674
Fighting like that

02:10.213 --> 02:12.674
right in front of me.

02:12.716 --> 02:16.136
What could possibly

02:12.716 --> 02:16.136
have possessed those two boys?

02:23.102 --> 02:26.271
(grunting)

02:26.313 --> 02:28.273
(choking)

02:28.315 --> 02:30.901
Help me!

02:30.943 --> 02:32.486
(choking)

02:32.527 --> 02:35.155
Help me.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.077
Oh, I'll help you.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.207
Hello, there.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.793
Hello.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.086
It's my son's birthday,

02:49.128 --> 02:50.879
and I wanted

02:49.128 --> 02:50.879
to buy him a comic book.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.714
He only wanted money,

02:52.756 --> 02:54.215
but he really loves this stuff

02:54.257 --> 02:56.217
and it just doesn't seem

02:54.257 --> 02:56.217
like a birthday

02:56.259 --> 02:57.970
if there's nothing to open.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.931
Do you work here?

03:00.973 --> 03:02.099
I have the conn.

03:02.141 --> 03:04.392
Oh, great.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.436
So, uh, do you have

03:04.434 --> 03:06.436
any suggestions?

03:06.478 --> 03:08.897
You know, something nice,

03:06.478 --> 03:08.897
like, $20?

03:08.939 --> 03:11.150
Well, if you're

03:08.939 --> 03:11.150
looking for

03:11.190 --> 03:13.234
a $20 comic book,

03:13.276 --> 03:16.030
you're in the league

03:13.276 --> 03:16.030
for Mr. Incredible.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.614
I don't think

03:16.071 --> 03:17.614
he's ready for that.

03:17.656 --> 03:18.615
And for only $20?

03:18.657 --> 03:20.034
Have you lost your mind?

03:18.657 --> 03:20.034
Hey!

03:20.075 --> 03:21.618
You guys shut up.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.618
No. Tell me about him.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.954
Oh, well, he's incredible.

03:23.996 --> 03:27.875
He's a rock star by day

03:23.996 --> 03:27.875
and superhero by night.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.502
He can shoot flames

03:27.916 --> 03:30.502
out of his eyes

03:30.544 --> 03:32.880
and melt his enemy's

03:30.544 --> 03:32.880
brains with his mind.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.715
Yeah. I think I read that one.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.968
Sir, there is no

03:34.756 --> 03:37.968
Mr. Incredible.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.260
(laughing, snickering)

03:39.302 --> 03:40.888
Well, then-then, why...

03:40.929 --> 03:43.264
Sir, the Middle Earthling

03:40.929 --> 03:43.264
is for clientele

03:43.306 --> 03:45.059
sophisticated enough

03:43.306 --> 03:45.059
to appreciate

03:45.100 --> 03:47.978
cinematic drawing and

03:45.100 --> 03:47.978
nonlinear storytelling.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.647
And I can see by your

03:48.020 --> 03:50.647
office drone shirt

03:50.689 --> 03:53.274
that you're not a serious

03:50.689 --> 03:53.274
graphic novel collector.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.693
Is the new Metamorpho in?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.277
Yes, Ricky, right away.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.277
Well, wait.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.072
Hey, I was...

03:56.319 --> 03:58.072
Excuse me...

03:58.113 --> 03:59.573
I'm helping a customer.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.287
Is that for my costume?

04:06.329 --> 04:07.164
What costume?

04:07.206 --> 04:08.289
The school play.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.374
I'm in the school play!

04:09.416 --> 04:10.500
Oh, right.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.501
You're a... tree?

04:11.543 --> 04:13.128
I'm Abraham Lincoln!

04:13.170 --> 04:14.004
I'm reciting

04:14.046 --> 04:15.005
the Gettysburg Address.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.297
Why do always do this to me?

04:16.339 --> 04:17.298
Oh, calm down.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.009
I always pull it together,

04:17.340 --> 04:19.009
don't I?

04:19.051 --> 04:21.011
Remember that great

04:19.051 --> 04:21.011
Frankenstein costume I made

04:21.053 --> 04:22.096
that everybody loved?

04:22.137 --> 04:23.304
Yeah.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.306
Can we use that again?

04:25.348 --> 04:26.600
(sighs)

04:28.351 --> 04:30.311
Hey, Otto, I think we have

04:28.351 --> 04:30.311
some vandals or something.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.563
There's more fences down,

04:31.605 --> 04:34.149
and this time some

04:31.605 --> 04:34.149
chickens were killed.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.151
It almost looks like they

04:34.191 --> 04:36.151
were stomped to death.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.277
La vaca diablo...

04:38.278 --> 04:39.487
...ha regresado.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.989
It was only the wind.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.324
But the chickens look

04:41.031 --> 04:43.324
like they exploded.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.326
Well, obviously,

04:43.366 --> 04:45.326
the broken fences flew

04:45.368 --> 04:46.745
to the other side

04:45.368 --> 04:46.745
of the ranch,

04:46.787 --> 04:49.330
hitting the chickens

04:46.787 --> 04:49.330
in a slamming motion

04:49.372 --> 04:51.750
and dragging them

04:49.372 --> 04:51.750
across the ground in a manner

04:51.792 --> 04:53.919
that closely resembles stomping.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.336
You see, there is

04:55.378 --> 04:58.799
a perfectly logical explanation

04:55.378 --> 04:58.799
for everything.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.218
¡La vaca diablo!

05:01.260 --> 05:02.343
Fue asi la vaca diablo!

05:02.385 --> 05:04.138
Perfectly logical.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.555
Was he saying

05:04.179 --> 05:05.555
"Devil cow"?

05:05.597 --> 05:07.808
Ah, it is a silly legend.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.769
Many years ago they say

05:10.811 --> 05:14.189
there was a cow

05:10.811 --> 05:14.189
who one day tasted human flesh

05:14.231 --> 05:16.150
and went bad.

05:16.191 --> 05:19.360
And now

05:16.191 --> 05:19.360
whenever the moon is red,

05:19.402 --> 05:21.404
she comes down

05:19.402 --> 05:21.404
from a mountain lair

05:21.446 --> 05:25.159
to drink the blood

05:21.446 --> 05:25.159
of the innocent.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.661
You're talking

05:25.200 --> 05:27.661
about a cow.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.370
Yeah, I know.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.370
Silly, isn't it?

05:29.412 --> 05:32.373
(goofy laugh)

05:32.415 --> 05:34.334
Oh...

05:38.421 --> 05:40.882
Wake up.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.592
What do  you  want?

05:42.634 --> 05:45.386
I just want to let you know

05:42.634 --> 05:45.386
you're not getting last licks.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.097
Huh?

05:45.428 --> 05:47.097
I'm sick of you always

05:47.139 --> 05:48.556
having an edge

05:47.139 --> 05:48.556
just 'cause you're an idiot

05:48.598 --> 05:50.391
and I'm smart and understand

05:48.598 --> 05:50.391
about consequences.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.394
I can be just as vicious

05:50.433 --> 05:53.394
and shortsighted as you.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.395
Oh, yeah.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.438
I'm really scared.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.607
Why don't you just...?

06:00.527 --> 06:01.653
(screams)

06:01.695 --> 06:02.779
What did you do?

06:02.821 --> 06:05.573
I sunk to  your  level.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.701
And I have to say...

06:05.615 --> 06:07.701
it feels good.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.704
(grunting)

06:18.377 --> 06:20.130
(screaming)

06:22.465 --> 06:24.509
How did comic book

06:22.465 --> 06:24.509
shopping go?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.427
Bad.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.430
I'm just out of my depth.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.433
Look, we both hoped

06:29.472 --> 06:32.433
it wouldn't come to this,

06:32.475 --> 06:34.435
but you know

06:32.475 --> 06:34.435
what we have to do.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.437
Hal, we promised

06:34.477 --> 06:36.437
ourselves we wouldn't.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.648
What other choice do we have?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.610
Isn't this interesting?

06:42.652 --> 06:45.239
Once more, I'm the only

06:42.652 --> 06:45.239
person that can help you.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.656
I'm your best friend

06:45.280 --> 06:46.656
when you need someone

06:46.698 --> 06:49.450
to pick up your mail

06:46.698 --> 06:49.450
or sit on a suitcase,

06:49.492 --> 06:51.452
but when it's time

06:49.492 --> 06:51.452
for a barbecue,

06:51.494 --> 06:53.454
I have to watch

06:51.494 --> 06:53.454
from the car.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.456
I got to tell you, Hal,

06:55.498 --> 06:58.919
this beer is tasting

06:55.498 --> 06:58.919
mighty bitter.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.461
I'll take another.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.130
Are you going to help me

07:00.503 --> 07:02.130
or not?

07:02.172 --> 07:03.257
I will help you.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.175
But one day--

07:03.298 --> 07:05.175
and that day may never come--

07:05.217 --> 07:07.761
I will ask you

07:05.217 --> 07:07.761
to perform a service for me.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.180
Actually, it'll be tomorrow.

07:10.222 --> 07:11.265
I'll be here

07:10.222 --> 07:11.265
about 10:00,

07:11.306 --> 07:13.308
and if it's nice,

07:11.306 --> 07:13.308
wear a bathing suit.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.477
What?

07:16.519 --> 07:17.729
What happened?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.189
It's horrible.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.481
What, the rug?

07:20.523 --> 07:21.942
That's no rug.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.736
It's an... antelope.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.405
Oh, my God!

07:26.446 --> 07:28.489
It's been completely flattened.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.491
Look. There's pieces

07:28.531 --> 07:30.491
in the tree.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.493
What could have done

07:30.533 --> 07:32.493
something like this?

07:32.535 --> 07:34.288
It-It was me.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.205
You?

07:34.329 --> 07:35.205
Yeah.

07:35.247 --> 07:36.497
On-on my moped.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.499
A-A terrible accident.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.751
It was dark.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.503
It jumped right in front of me.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.504
I had perhaps

07:43.546 --> 07:46.507
a few too many Cajun martinis.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.885
That should be a lesson

07:46.549 --> 07:48.885
to all of us, hey?

07:48.927 --> 07:50.304
(chuckles)

07:50.345 --> 07:53.514
Go get a shovel

07:50.345 --> 07:53.514
and some sawdust.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.530
Okay, hold still.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.532
I don't think I want

08:09.572 --> 08:11.532
to be in this play.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.160
Now, I've been

08:11.574 --> 08:13.160
doing some reading,

08:13.201 --> 08:15.536
and this Lincoln person

08:13.201 --> 08:15.536
wasn't such a great guy.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.747
Did you know that the

08:15.578 --> 08:17.747
Emancipation Proclamation

08:17.789 --> 08:20.250
wasn't about slavery

08:17.789 --> 08:20.250
at all?

08:20.292 --> 08:21.542
It was strictly

08:20.292 --> 08:21.542
a political move.

08:21.584 --> 08:22.961
Honey, you're just nervous

08:23.003 --> 08:25.380
'cause you've never had a part

08:23.003 --> 08:25.380
with lines before.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.547
Or where you move.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.799
For the love of God!

08:27.841 --> 08:31.511
He suspended the writ of

08:27.841 --> 08:31.511
habeas corpus in Maryland!

08:32.595 --> 08:34.555
You should have seen Reese.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.555
It was hysterical.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.558
Are you sure...

08:34.597 --> 08:37.558
you want...

08:37.600 --> 08:39.560
to push him?

08:39.602 --> 08:40.770
It's the only way

08:39.602 --> 08:40.770
to get through

08:40.812 --> 08:42.397
to his primitive

08:40.812 --> 08:42.397
little monkey brain.

08:42.439 --> 08:44.441
He has to know

08:42.439 --> 08:44.441
that I'm not going to back down.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.818
What is this?

08:50.113 --> 08:50.822
Oh, my God!

08:50.864 --> 08:52.573
If you can be vicious,

08:52.615 --> 08:53.825
I can be smart.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.035
How many copies did you make?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.244
I don't know.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.579
How many copies are there

08:56.286 --> 08:58.579
in a pack of 500 sheets?

08:58.621 --> 08:59.580
This is over, Reese.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.416
I don't know

08:59.622 --> 09:01.416
why you're so upset.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.127
Look at you going

09:01.458 --> 09:04.127
like a big boy.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.886
(airhorn honking loudly)

09:12.927 --> 09:14.804
(screaming)

09:16.097 --> 09:18.599
All right, two

09:16.097 --> 09:18.599
scoops, fudge ripple.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.602
Now  are we going to

09:18.641 --> 09:21.602
the comic book store?

09:21.644 --> 09:23.813
(imitates Yoda): Patience, Luke.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.813
You are reckless.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.773
We've gone to the beach,

09:23.855 --> 09:25.773
we've gone to the movies.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.984
I won you an animal

09:25.815 --> 09:27.984
at the church bazaar.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.904
We've gone out for coffee,

09:28.026 --> 09:30.904
lunch, Slushees, pie.

09:30.945 --> 09:34.449
I can't negotiate unless

09:30.945 --> 09:34.449
I'm firing on all cylinders.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.868
Just have many

09:34.491 --> 09:36.868
cylinders do you have?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.412
Pull over.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.829
No, you're right.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.829
I'm sorry.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.081
That was uncalled for.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.249
Pull over.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.000
Craig, I am not

09:42.290 --> 09:44.000
pulling over.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.210
Just let me out of the car.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.628
Craig, I am not

09:45.252 --> 09:47.628
stopping this car.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.629
(whistle blowing)

09:48.671 --> 09:49.630
All right,

09:48.671 --> 09:49.630
all right!

09:49.672 --> 09:51.632
Calm down.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.468
You are going

09:51.674 --> 09:53.468
to have to learn

09:53.510 --> 09:56.721
how to get along

09:53.510 --> 09:56.721
without Craig Feldspar.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.849
My ducky.

09:59.891 --> 10:00.808
(toy squeaks)

10:00.850 --> 10:03.728
(laughter)

10:03.770 --> 10:05.313
Hey.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.523
Get out of here. I'm busy.

10:06.565 --> 10:07.648
I'll be quick.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.650
You know, while I was

10:07.690 --> 10:09.650
ripping down all those flyers,

10:09.692 --> 10:11.278
I was racking my brain

10:09.692 --> 10:11.278
trying to come up

10:11.319 --> 10:12.653
with some way

10:11.319 --> 10:12.653
to get back at you.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.696
And I began to wonder.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.906
What's the point?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.492
No matter how hard I try,

10:14.948 --> 10:17.492
nothing ever stops you.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.660
Maybe you're just better

10:17.534 --> 10:19.660
at this than I am.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.246
Well, yeah.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.246
Then again,

10:21.288 --> 10:23.623
maybe we should ask your friends

10:21.288 --> 10:23.623
what they think.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.084
What?

10:26.126 --> 10:27.168
Your friends.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.669
These are friends,

10:27.210 --> 10:28.669
aren't they?

10:28.711 --> 10:29.712
You're always hanging out

10:29.754 --> 10:31.465
with them or near them anyway.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.634
Hey, do any of you know

10:31.506 --> 10:34.634
this kid's name?

10:35.635 --> 10:36.677
This kid right here.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.263
Do any of you know his name?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.681
But he's always

10:38.305 --> 10:40.681
following you around.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.683
You never noticed

10:40.723 --> 10:42.683
him before?

10:42.725 --> 10:46.480
So he's been sitting

10:42.725 --> 10:46.480
right next to you for months

10:46.521 --> 10:48.189
just pretending

10:46.521 --> 10:48.189
to be your friend?

10:48.231 --> 10:50.691
Wow. That's sad.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.693
Well, uh,

10:50.733 --> 10:52.693
his name's Reese.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.696
And guess what?

10:52.735 --> 10:55.696
I'm better than you.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.907
I win. It's over.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.129
(retching)

11:14.382 --> 11:17.469
♪ ♪

11:25.684 --> 11:27.604
Gretchen?

11:27.646 --> 11:28.896
Gretchen, I...

11:28.938 --> 11:31.608
Whoa, uh!

11:31.650 --> 11:32.691
(screaming)

11:34.444 --> 11:36.737
Otto, what?

11:34.444 --> 11:36.737
I have seen it, Francis!

11:36.779 --> 11:38.198
The devil cow!

11:38.239 --> 11:40.158
It had eyes like

11:38.239 --> 11:40.158
burning embers

11:40.200 --> 11:42.661
and breath

11:40.200 --> 11:42.661
from the bowels of hell!

11:42.701 --> 11:43.744
Oh, it was horrible.

11:43.786 --> 11:44.996
More horrible than this?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.331
We must leave this place.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.582
Burn it down.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.833
Start over.

11:48.875 --> 11:49.792
Yeah.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.211
No. Enough is enough.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.421
We're not running

11:51.252 --> 11:53.421
away from a cow.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.631
We're not?

11:54.673 --> 11:56.633
No. We're not.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.759
From now on...

11:58.801 --> 12:01.720
I'm lactose intolerant.

12:07.602 --> 12:08.687
Okay, Dewey,

12:07.602 --> 12:08.687
here's your costume.

12:08.727 --> 12:09.770
Now, your father and I

12:09.812 --> 12:11.064
will see you at the show

12:09.812 --> 12:11.064
this afternoon.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.148
I'm going to throw up.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.191
What if I forget my part?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.402
What if something

12:13.233 --> 12:15.402
flies out of my nose

12:15.443 --> 12:16.986
like it did at show and tell?

12:17.028 --> 12:19.364
Dewey, I'm going to let you in

12:17.028 --> 12:19.364
on a little secret.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.948
When you're

12:19.406 --> 12:20.948
up on that stage,

12:20.990 --> 12:23.159
all you have to do

12:20.990 --> 12:23.159
is look out in the front row.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.827
Your father and I

12:23.201 --> 12:24.827
will be sitting there,

12:24.869 --> 12:27.581
and you just look me in the eyes

12:24.869 --> 12:27.581
and you'll know

12:27.622 --> 12:30.208
that everything's going

12:27.622 --> 12:30.208
to be all right, okay?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.001
Okay.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.671
And if you still feel

12:32.043 --> 12:34.671
like throwing up,

12:34.713 --> 12:35.796
use the hat.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.798
MALCOLM:

12:35.838 --> 12:37.798
Reese totally had that coming.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.800
I'm not... arguing.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.469
Seriously, humiliation

12:39.842 --> 12:41.469
is the only thing

12:41.511 --> 12:42.803
that jerk understands.

12:42.845 --> 12:43.971
Fine.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.806
Why are you

12:44.013 --> 12:45.806
taking  his  side?!

12:45.848 --> 12:47.559
Ooh, a birthday card.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.605
Five dollars Canadian.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.814
Pretty good

12:51.646 --> 12:53.814
for Grandma.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.401
So, I'll have the rest of my

12:53.856 --> 12:56.401
birthday money on Saturday,

12:56.443 --> 12:59.362
so I can give you the 300 bucks

12:56.443 --> 12:59.362
for the computer when...

13:00.363 --> 13:01.989
"Dear Malcolm, Ha-ha.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.408
"Now I win.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.784
Your  friend,  Reese."

13:09.788 --> 13:11.750
They'll try you...

13:11.790 --> 13:13.376
as an adult!

13:31.352 --> 13:35.356
Uh, yes, I'm looking for

13:31.352 --> 13:35.356
a serious graphic novel

13:35.398 --> 13:37.858
with cinematic drawings

13:37.900 --> 13:41.696
and neat, linear storytelling.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.323
Weren't you in here

13:41.738 --> 13:43.323
the other day?

13:43.364 --> 13:44.949
No, I...

13:46.367 --> 13:47.868
Okay, look.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.789
I just want to buy a present

13:47.910 --> 13:50.789
for my son, okay?

13:50.829 --> 13:51.914
I don't think

13:50.829 --> 13:51.914
that's a crime.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.917
As I see it, my only crime

13:51.956 --> 13:54.917
is not knowing as much as you.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.171
Look, you all have parents,

13:56.127 --> 13:58.171
don't you?

13:58.212 --> 14:00.881
I am appealing to you

13:58.212 --> 14:00.881
as decent human beings

14:00.923 --> 14:03.384
to help me give my son

14:00.923 --> 14:03.384
a happy birthday.

14:04.927 --> 14:05.970
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.348
I guess we did kind of get off

14:06.012 --> 14:08.348
on the wrong foot.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.848
We all got to

14:08.389 --> 14:09.848
start somewhere.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.103
This one's called

14:11.850 --> 14:14.103
Dead Man's Shoes.

14:14.145 --> 14:15.605
It's 50 bucks.

14:15.647 --> 14:16.939
It's all about

14:15.647 --> 14:16.939
alienation.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.899
I think your son

14:16.981 --> 14:18.899
will really like it.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.901
Thank you.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.903
Not so fast.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.284
This transaction does

14:25.406 --> 14:28.284
not concern you, Feldspar.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.703
It's Craig Feldspar.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.788
He's a level 45

14:29.744 --> 14:31.788
Dungeon Master.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.915
What cereal box

14:32.955 --> 14:34.915
did you shake this out of, Dean?

14:34.957 --> 14:37.585
It's the first print.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.585
It's totally collectable.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.796
Oh. Should we check

14:37.627 --> 14:39.796
the Overstreet?

14:39.838 --> 14:41.964
Wait, we don't have to.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.342
1997-- first and only printing.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.927
50,000 returns,

14:44.384 --> 14:46.927
all in circulation.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.763
I'd keep this

14:46.969 --> 14:48.763
in my bathroom,

14:48.805 --> 14:50.181
but not for reading.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.600
This isn't a comic book store.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.185
It's a novelty shop!

14:54.227 --> 14:55.144
Oh, really?

14:55.186 --> 14:59.232
Well, I'd like to see

14:55.186 --> 14:59.232
the novelty shop

14:59.273 --> 15:02.318
that carries an original

14:59.273 --> 15:02.318
Spider-Man  number 14

15:02.360 --> 15:05.446
with the first appearance

15:02.360 --> 15:05.446
of the Green Goblin.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.406
You're kidding.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.324
If you changed

15:06.447 --> 15:08.324
to a more respectful tone,

15:08.366 --> 15:09.950
I just might let...

15:09.992 --> 15:10.951
What are you doing?!

15:10.993 --> 15:12.203
Fear not.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.413
It's the 1993 reprint.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.789
If it had been an original,

15:14.831 --> 15:17.166
he would have thrown himself

15:14.831 --> 15:17.166
in front of it.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.961
Dude, you told me

15:17.208 --> 15:20.961
that was real.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.672
Now...

15:22.714 --> 15:25.633
let's talk business.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.134
(chortling)

15:27.176 --> 15:29.011
Craig, I can't

15:27.176 --> 15:29.011
thank you enough.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.179
That was fantastic!

15:30.221 --> 15:32.891
You were so heroic.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.601
I like to think we all have

15:34.642 --> 15:36.811
a little bit of Aquaman

15:34.642 --> 15:36.811
right here.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.979
Well, I must say, you

15:36.853 --> 15:38.979
really know your stuff.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.440
I'm impressed.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.776
Well, you know...

15:40.481 --> 15:42.776
if you're interested,

15:42.817 --> 15:44.985
there is a convention

15:42.817 --> 15:44.985
next Saturday.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.321
I have a life, Craig.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.744

15:54.537 --> 15:57.206
MAN:

15:54.537 --> 15:57.206
Car number 15, no bumping.

15:57.248 --> 15:58.416
Return to the pit area.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.459
What the hell are you doing?!

15:59.500 --> 16:00.835
MALCOLM:

15:59.500 --> 16:00.835
You had no right!

16:00.877 --> 16:02.879
You stole from me!

16:00.877 --> 16:02.879
That was my money!

16:02.921 --> 16:04.380
Fine. Let's see.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.006
I've done 63 laps.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.300
Keep the change!

MAN:

16:07.341 --> 16:09.009
Car eight, let's be courteous.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.678
It ends here, Reese!

16:10.720 --> 16:12.388
I don't care about the money!

16:12.430 --> 16:14.056
I don't care about my birthday!

16:14.098 --> 16:16.392
I don't care about your safety

16:14.098 --> 16:16.392
or mine!

16:16.434 --> 16:19.604
I don't care about anything

16:16.434 --> 16:19.604
except making you suffer!

16:19.646 --> 16:21.021
Well, I don't care either!

16:21.063 --> 16:24.442
Fine! Let's see

16:21.063 --> 16:24.442
who cares the least the most!

16:24.484 --> 16:26.611
MAN:

Okay, you just lost

16:26.653 --> 16:28.237
two weeks arcade privileges.

This is a game of chicken

16:28.279 --> 16:30.865
Reese is not going to win!

16:30.907 --> 16:33.033
I'm too angry to blink!

16:30.907 --> 16:33.033
When he sees my face,

16:33.075 --> 16:34.911
he's going to know

16:33.075 --> 16:34.911
he doesn't have a chance!

Maybe this wasn't such a good...

16:48.382 --> 16:50.510
(crash)

16:59.101 --> 17:01.479
Ugh!

17:03.815 --> 17:05.232
I should have told

17:03.815 --> 17:05.232
the doctor

17:05.274 --> 17:07.067
to sew fur and tails

17:05.274 --> 17:07.067

Only, animals

would be easier

17:09.570 --> 17:11.071
'cause then

17:09.570 --> 17:11.071
I could have you fixed.

For all the good it does,

you're grounded, again.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.576
Thanks for getting me

17:13.700 --> 17:15.576
grounded on my birthday.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.495
Oh, boo-hoo,

17:15.618 --> 17:17.495
I was grounded on my birthday.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.873
MALCOLM: I was just

17:17.537 --> 17:19.873
standing up for myself.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.749
There is such a thing

17:19.914 --> 17:21.749
as justice, you know!

17:21.791 --> 17:23.125
Well, there is such a thing

17:21.791 --> 17:23.125
as "shut up!"

17:23.167 --> 17:25.085
Stop it.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.295
Malcolm, do you remember

17:26.337 --> 17:28.088
what you did for your birthday

17:26.337 --> 17:28.088
last year?

17:28.130 --> 17:30.090
Nothing. I was

17:28.130 --> 17:30.090
grounded then, too.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.091
And what about your birthday?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.092
You grounded me after

17:32.134 --> 17:34.012
I smashed Malcolm's face

17:32.134 --> 17:34.012
into the cake.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.429
And your birthday before that?

17:36.639 --> 17:37.807
Pretty much this.

17:37.849 --> 17:38.975
Wait.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.142
When did you push me

17:39.017 --> 17:40.142
off the pony?

17:40.184 --> 17:42.520
Do you realize

17:40.184 --> 17:42.520
that neither of you

17:42.562 --> 17:45.982
has had a birthday party

17:42.562 --> 17:45.982
in his entire life?

17:47.149 --> 17:50.110
Don't you think that's sad?

17:50.152 --> 17:52.947
Every chance you have had

17:50.152 --> 17:52.947
for a little happiness--

17:52.989 --> 17:55.992
a little something special--

17:52.989 --> 17:55.992
you threw it away.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.787
At some point, this has to stop.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.040
Is revenge ever worth it?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.708
Is it worth it now?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.126
Do you feel happy?

18:06.168 --> 18:08.046
There's no reason to

18:06.168 --> 18:08.046
compete with each other.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.172
We love you

18:08.087 --> 18:10.172
both the same.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.133
There are no favorites

18:10.214 --> 18:13.133
in this family.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.094
Where  is  Dewey?

18:21.434 --> 18:24.103
I said, there's

18:21.434 --> 18:24.103
Mr. Lincoln now.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.533
We love you, Dewey.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.785
You can do it, son.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.369
We're so proud of you.

hadn't scarred her for life.

Oh, bravo.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.432
Why don't you

19:41.347 --> 19:43.432
have another drink?

19:45.476 --> 19:48.688
Francis, this is not the time

19:45.476 --> 19:48.688
to study animal husbandry.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.314
We have a cow to kill.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.400

in here that can help us.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.736
You know what will help us?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.736
The bullet.

19:55.778 --> 19:58.322
The bullet is always the answer.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.282
Oh, my God, it is here!

20:00.324 --> 20:01.492
That's it!

20:01.534 --> 20:03.202
I know what we have to do!

20:04.286 --> 20:08.499
Ah! Oh! Francis! Oof!

20:08.541 --> 20:09.667
(yelling)

20:09.709 --> 20:10.710
Oof!

20:10.751 --> 20:13.212
Oh...

20:14.547 --> 20:16.256
No, please, please,

20:16.298 --> 20:17.466
no!

20:17.508 --> 20:19.093
(sobbing):

20:17.508 --> 20:19.093
No!

20:19.135 --> 20:21.261
All right, Bessie,

20:21.303 --> 20:23.139
you've been causing

20:21.303 --> 20:23.139
a lot of trouble,

20:23.181 --> 20:24.598
and it stops now.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.353
You are going to be milked.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.273
There you go.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.152
You been up in those mountains

20:33.315 --> 20:36.152
so long all engorged,

20:36.194 --> 20:37.778
no wonder you were so angry.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.198
You're not evil at all.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.659
You're just a lady

20:40.239 --> 20:43.659
with a little too much milk.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.912
(moos)

20:45.953 --> 20:47.287
Well, this new

20:45.953 --> 20:47.287
game is good,

20:47.329 --> 20:49.289
but it doesn't

20:47.329 --> 20:49.289
quite buy me off.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.291
You still didn't

20:49.331 --> 20:51.291
come to my play.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.754
Well, how would you like

20:51.333 --> 20:54.754
Malcolm's comic book, hmm?

20:54.795 --> 20:57.381
I'm starting to get over it.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.467
Happy birthday, Malcolm.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.262
Thanks.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.017
Don't eat

21:06.766 --> 21:08.017
that blueberry.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.936
I'm saving it.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.316
What's the worst

21:14.440 --> 21:16.316
that can happen?
