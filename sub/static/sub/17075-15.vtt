00:00.116 --> 00:01.726
When you're a creative individual

00:01.729 --> 00:02.903
at a Catholic high school,

00:02.905 --> 00:05.422
most classes feel like the
final season of "Lost"...

00:05.424 --> 00:07.990
Unsatisfying, and the
cute guys are all straight,

00:07.992 --> 00:11.686
which is why I'm so excited to
be taking music appreciation.

00:13.857 --> 00:15.156
What are you doing here?

00:15.158 --> 00:16.958
Enriching my mind and my spirit,

00:16.960 --> 00:18.659
like that time I read The New Yorker

00:18.661 --> 00:19.927
not just for the cartoons.

00:19.929 --> 00:20.937
What are you doing here?

00:20.939 --> 00:22.805
Oh, Kenny.

00:22.807 --> 00:24.966
Stupid, stupid Kenny.

00:24.968 --> 00:26.173
I don't get what's so funny.

00:26.175 --> 00:28.478
Well, music appreciation is a joke.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.404
I seriously doubt that.

00:30.406 --> 00:31.747
All right, kids.

00:31.749 --> 00:34.217
Welcome to the wonderful world of music.

00:34.219 --> 00:36.919
Take out a piece of paper,
write something on it,

00:36.921 --> 00:38.688
and grade yourselves.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.990
And do not interrupt me while
I'm doing my scratch-off.

00:43.962 --> 00:45.528
Ms. Dunn? Kenny O'Neal here.

00:45.530 --> 00:49.791
I, for one, am thirsty for
a bit of music education.

00:51.060 --> 00:52.693
Don't mind my brother, Ms. Dunn.

00:52.695 --> 00:54.595
He's gay, so he likes
unnecessary conflict.

00:54.597 --> 00:56.130
Sit down, Kenny. This isn't Bravo.

00:56.132 --> 00:59.467
Oh, my God.

00:59.469 --> 01:01.883
I just won $1 million.

01:01.885 --> 01:02.985
I'm free.

01:02.987 --> 01:05.473
The nightmare is over!

01:05.474 --> 01:07.175
But you're still gonna
teach, though, yeah?

01:07.177 --> 01:08.376
Why start now?

01:08.378 --> 01:11.712
Adiós

01:12.174 --> 01:15.383

01:16.286 --> 01:18.986
All right, help me decide, Father Phil.

01:18.988 --> 01:20.897
What's a better appetizer
for the bishop...

01:20.899 --> 01:22.398
Deviled eggs or pigs in a blanket?

01:22.400 --> 01:25.735
Well, invoking the devil with
the bishop is probably a no-no,

01:25.737 --> 01:28.783
but let me taste.

01:28.785 --> 01:31.073
Mmm. Okay.

01:31.075 --> 01:33.209
Devil be damned, this is a yes-yes.

01:33.211 --> 01:35.811
Oh, thank God. I'm just
so nervous and excited.

01:35.813 --> 01:37.446
I cannot believe that the church

01:37.448 --> 01:39.889
chose our family to host
a dinner for the bishop.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.751
Ever since the
Stackwells' murder-suicide,

01:41.753 --> 01:43.586
you are our top divorced family.

01:43.588 --> 01:45.555
That is so nice to hear.

01:45.557 --> 01:46.689
It's a real honor.

01:46.691 --> 01:49.091
What's also nice is
that it gives us a chance

01:49.093 --> 01:50.326
to show everyone that, you know,

01:50.328 --> 01:52.228
the whole dad-living-
in-the-garage situation

01:52.230 --> 01:54.597
not only works, but it has
the approval of the church.

01:54.599 --> 01:56.232
It is not a garage.

01:56.234 --> 01:58.868
I've told you a million
times... It's a tiny house.

01:58.870 --> 02:00.702
Father Phil. Ooh! Hello, deviled eggs.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.272
Ahh! We have two days to get
this place ready for the bishop,

02:03.274 --> 02:05.633
and you still haven't
fixed the garbage disposal.

02:07.912 --> 02:10.937
I never got this kind of
'tude from the Stackwells.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.510
You are never gonna believe
what happened at school today.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.378
You actually paid attention
and learned something?

02:18.380 --> 02:21.848
Hey, that's a good one. No.

02:21.851 --> 02:24.452
So, uh, my teacher
Ms. Dunn won $1 million

02:24.454 --> 02:25.689
off a scratch-off ticket,

02:25.692 --> 02:27.622
and then she said some
sweet curse words and quit.

02:27.624 --> 02:28.623
It was... It was awesome.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.057
Wait, wait. Ms. Dunn?

02:30.059 --> 02:32.213
- Short, big eyes, frizzy hair?
- Yeah. That's her.

02:34.464 --> 02:37.098
You know what? I'm feeling lucky today.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.267
I'm gonna have one of
those scratchers, please.

02:41.804 --> 02:43.671
Ms. Dunn, right?

02:43.673 --> 02:44.972
Oh, is that all you have?

02:44.974 --> 02:47.608
I also have a cat and
a very loving niece.

02:47.610 --> 02:48.976
Why don't you go ahead?

02:48.978 --> 02:50.945
Oh, thanks.

02:50.947 --> 02:52.813
One scratch-off, please.

02:52.815 --> 02:53.881
And a packet of condoms.

02:53.883 --> 02:57.051
You never know.

02:57.053 --> 02:58.619
I let her go ahead of me.

02:58.621 --> 03:01.222
That was supposed to be my ticket.

03:01.225 --> 03:03.605
That was supposed to be my $1 million.

03:03.608 --> 03:05.526
My whole life could have been different.

03:05.528 --> 03:07.695
She only has a cat and a niece, Dad.

03:07.697 --> 03:09.096
So you can get in there.

03:14.437 --> 03:17.138
Thanks for coming in on
such short notice, everybody.

03:17.140 --> 03:18.973
As you know, Ms. Dunn hit the jackpot

03:18.975 --> 03:21.943
and never has to come back
to this hell-ishly wonderful

03:21.945 --> 03:23.210
institution of learning.

03:23.212 --> 03:25.713
So just sit tight while
I consult with my team,

03:25.715 --> 03:27.048
and I'll be back in a jiff.

03:27.050 --> 03:29.317
Are these the new teaching candidates

03:29.319 --> 03:31.185
for music appreciation class?

03:31.187 --> 03:32.787
Tired.

03:32.789 --> 03:34.388
Dead inside.

03:34.390 --> 03:35.690
Uninspired.

03:35.692 --> 03:37.458
Wait a second.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.327
Italian loafer, no socks.

03:39.329 --> 03:41.696
A Patek Philippe watch.

03:41.698 --> 03:43.764
Gingham and plaid on purpose?

03:43.766 --> 03:46.701
This man is a homosexual.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.172
Hello. I'm Kenny O'Neal.

03:51.174 --> 03:52.173
Hi. I'm Mr. Peters.

03:52.175 --> 03:53.174
Hi.

03:53.176 --> 03:54.675
Um, I'm a student helper.

03:54.677 --> 03:56.177
I'm making photocopies of résumés

03:56.179 --> 03:57.211
for Vice Principal Murray.

03:57.213 --> 03:59.246
May I see yours?

04:01.951 --> 04:04.919
20 years on Broadway?

04:04.921 --> 04:07.054
Gay Men's Chorus?

04:07.056 --> 04:10.157
Former personal assistant
to Elaine Stritch?!

04:10.159 --> 04:11.559
Not bad.

04:11.561 --> 04:14.428
Oh, my God. This guy
might be the gay role model

04:14.430 --> 04:15.696
I've been looking for.

04:15.698 --> 04:18.332
He could help me become
the best version of me,

04:18.334 --> 04:20.468
or rather, do, re, mi.

04:20.470 --> 04:24.238
Let's start at the very beginning.

04:24.240 --> 04:27.942
♪ A very good place to start ♪

04:27.944 --> 04:30.311
♪ When you read, you begin with... ♪

04:30.313 --> 04:31.612

A-B-C.

04:33.583 --> 04:37.351
♪ When you sing, you
begin with do, re, mi ♪

04:37.353 --> 04:39.587

05:09.018 --> 05:10.217
- Ow.
- No carbs.

05:10.219 --> 05:12.353
We bake for others.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.854
You have to hire Mr. Peters.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.089
Oh, thank God!

05:15.091 --> 05:16.991
This thing keeps saying,
"Ask again. Ask again."

05:16.993 --> 05:19.060
I've been asking again for 10 minutes.

05:19.062 --> 05:20.594
I hate this!

05:20.596 --> 05:22.029
I hate this! I hate this!

05:22.031 --> 05:24.298
If you hate this so much,
then why are you doing it?

05:24.300 --> 05:26.067
Well, I would have
hired a plumber, Shannon,

05:26.069 --> 05:27.268
but I'm not a millionaire

05:27.270 --> 05:30.137
like that frizzy-hair
dream-stealer Ms. Dunn.

05:30.139 --> 05:32.139
You know why she's a
millionaire and you're not?

05:32.141 --> 05:33.340
You're too nice.

05:33.342 --> 05:35.876
- That's very sweet of you to say.
- Stop it!

05:35.878 --> 05:38.379
You're constantly putting other
people's needs before your own.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.081
If you hadn't let that
teacher go ahead of you,

05:40.083 --> 05:41.449
you'd be the millionaire right now

05:41.451 --> 05:43.484
rather than some guy
playing "Final Destination"

05:43.486 --> 05:44.785
with a garbage disposal.

05:44.787 --> 05:47.721
Listen, when you grow up in a big family

05:47.723 --> 05:50.024
with six brothers sharing
five pairs of underwear,

05:50.026 --> 05:52.126
you kind of learn not to
want anything for yourself.

05:52.128 --> 05:54.395
Okay, well, then it's
time to unlearn that.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.430
You have to put yourself first for once.

05:56.432 --> 05:58.499
If you had $1 million,
what would you buy?

06:00.103 --> 06:03.170
Well, I-I have always wanted
an electric toothbrush.

06:03.172 --> 06:05.072
Oh, my God, Dad! Think bigger!

06:05.074 --> 06:07.741
Anything in the world.
What would you want?

06:07.743 --> 06:09.610
I don't know. I don't know what I want!

06:09.612 --> 06:10.878
Well, then figure it out.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.513
What do you really want?

06:12.515 --> 06:14.949
I really want to stop being
yelled at by a little girl.

06:14.951 --> 06:17.051
Well, then maybe you
should stop acting like one.

06:17.053 --> 06:17.885
Ohh!

06:17.887 --> 06:19.320
Okay, maybe that was too far.

06:20.237 --> 06:22.110
Good morning, class.

06:22.113 --> 06:25.239
Good morning. Mr. Peters, I brought you

06:25.241 --> 06:27.007
a Jazz apple from New Zealand

06:27.009 --> 06:31.345
because I'm suspecting we both
have a mutual love of Bob Fosse.

06:31.347 --> 06:32.946
It's pronounced Foss-ay.

06:32.948 --> 06:35.115
- No, I'm pretty sure it's Fo...
- Sit down.

06:35.117 --> 06:36.884
Okay.

06:38.687 --> 06:40.354
Let's start at the very beginning...

06:40.356 --> 06:41.889
It's happening.

06:41.891 --> 06:44.491
...with the gloomy harmonics
of the Renaissance period.

06:44.493 --> 06:45.959
I don't know what any of that means,

06:45.961 --> 06:47.494
but it doesn't matter,

06:47.496 --> 06:50.511
because I'm already
going to give myself an A.

06:50.514 --> 06:52.566
All right. Well, since
you've already got an A,

06:52.568 --> 06:53.867
then surely you must know the difference

06:53.869 --> 06:55.135
between a madrigal and a cantata.

06:55.137 --> 06:56.970
Oh, yeah. Uh, a madrigal

06:56.972 --> 06:58.405
is something that David Blaine does.

06:58.407 --> 07:00.635
And a cantata is something
Mommy makes for breakfast.

07:03.045 --> 07:04.311
Good.

07:04.313 --> 07:05.545
You know what I think is funny?

07:05.547 --> 07:07.247
You all just bought yourselves

07:07.249 --> 07:10.017
a 500-word oral presentation on this.

07:15.190 --> 07:16.957
Is that the theme to "Die Hard 3"?

07:16.959 --> 07:19.760
No. It's Carl Orff's "Carmina Burana."

07:19.762 --> 07:21.828
Huh. Is Bruce Willis in that, too?

07:21.830 --> 07:24.865
Let's make it 1,000 words.
And it's due tomorrow.

07:24.867 --> 07:26.233
Okay, seriously?

07:26.235 --> 07:28.702
Um, Mr. Peters, I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

07:28.704 --> 07:30.637
To put it in musical
terms, before you came,

07:30.639 --> 07:35.509
this class was a bit
more adagio than allegro.

07:35.511 --> 07:37.277
So, you know, maybe we could ease

07:37.279 --> 07:39.046
into a more strenuous curriculum?

07:39.048 --> 07:40.814
I hear you. This is my first day.

07:40.816 --> 07:42.249
I don't know how this school works.

07:42.251 --> 07:43.917
I'm probably being a little overzealous.

07:43.919 --> 07:45.419
Why don't we take a little
sidebar in the hallway

07:45.421 --> 07:46.954
and you two can help me
adjust my teaching style?

07:46.956 --> 07:48.722
Oh! I've got ideas.

07:49.591 --> 07:51.325
This is good.

07:51.327 --> 07:53.226
We're getting a dialogue going.

07:55.885 --> 07:57.531
Hmm.

07:57.533 --> 07:59.933
So, this is a sidebar.

08:01.036 --> 08:03.503
Oh! What smells like Delaware?

08:03.505 --> 08:04.604
Ugh!

08:04.606 --> 08:07.808
Oh, I can't believe your father

08:07.810 --> 08:09.710
hasn't fixed the garbage disposal.

08:09.712 --> 08:12.512
Ugh!

08:12.514 --> 08:13.880
What has your father been doing?

08:13.882 --> 08:15.983
Hopefully putting
himself first for once.

08:15.985 --> 08:18.719
I told you to stop
reading that Deepak Chopra.

08:18.721 --> 08:21.288
How am I gonna make
this dinner with no sink?

08:21.290 --> 08:23.056
Knockity-knock-knock.

08:23.058 --> 08:25.425
Just knock for real or come right in.

08:25.427 --> 08:27.928
Sorrity-sor-sor... Oh, I apologize.

08:27.930 --> 08:29.730
Oh, good. You brought your tool belt.

08:29.732 --> 08:31.865
Did Pat call you to fix
the garbage disposal?

08:31.867 --> 08:34.501
Oh, no. Pat invited me over to
check out his new meat smoker.

08:34.503 --> 08:38.138
This tool belt is for grillin' and...

08:39.875 --> 08:41.241
...chillin'.

08:41.243 --> 08:44.745
Huh? It's the biggest one you
can get with out a license.

08:44.747 --> 08:47.581
And, apparently, it's
the same one The Rock has.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.016
Dad, this is awesome!

08:49.018 --> 08:51.918
I know! Now I can literally
smell what The Rock is cooking.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.587
Thanks for pushing me to do it, sweetie.

08:53.589 --> 08:55.889
Hey, want to help me
season up these puppies?

08:55.891 --> 08:58.225
Sure, if they're not actual puppies.

08:58.227 --> 08:59.893
So, this is what you've been up to?

08:59.895 --> 09:02.963
Instead of fixing the garbage
disposal, you bought this toy?

09:02.965 --> 09:05.165
Oh, come on! This is not a toy!

09:05.167 --> 09:07.467
It has metal ears and a snout.

09:07.469 --> 09:09.536
Well, the snout doubles as an air vent.

09:09.538 --> 09:12.406
Eileen, the Pigerator
2000 is serious business.

09:12.408 --> 09:14.674
Shut it down, roll it into the shed,

09:14.676 --> 09:16.176
and return all this meat.

09:16.178 --> 09:17.210
I can't return it.

09:17.212 --> 09:18.478
I've been rubbing my meat all morning.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.646
And I'm gonna help him pound it.

09:19.648 --> 09:20.847
This is ridiculous, Pat,

09:20.849 --> 09:22.716
and the bishop will be here very soon.

09:22.718 --> 09:24.551
Well, hey, maybe I think
it's a little ridiculous

09:24.553 --> 09:26.019
that we're worrying
about impressing a bishop

09:26.021 --> 09:27.654
- we've never even met.
- Oh, now, now.

09:27.656 --> 09:28.855
Don't fight. You're scaring Shannon.

09:28.857 --> 09:30.223
I'm not scared.

09:30.225 --> 09:32.893
I'm proud of my dad for
finally taking care of himself.

09:32.895 --> 09:36.163
Pat, finish up your little project,

09:36.165 --> 09:38.131
fix the garbage disposal,

09:38.133 --> 09:40.467
then get in the shower,
and put on a suit.

09:40.469 --> 09:43.737
Eileen, we're not married anymore.

09:43.739 --> 09:45.338
So you can't tell me what to do.

09:45.340 --> 09:46.540
Well, somebody has to,

09:46.542 --> 09:49.042
because you cannot meet the
bishop dressed like that.

09:49.044 --> 09:51.711
Well, then I guess I just
don't get to meet the bishop.

09:51.713 --> 09:54.181
I just realized. When I said
I was gonna pound Pat's meat,

09:54.183 --> 09:56.316
it could be taken the wrong way.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.521
I'm going to give Mr. Peters
the benefit of the doubt.

10:01.523 --> 10:03.523
Yes, he had a rough start,

10:03.525 --> 10:07.160
but I know that deep down
within that uptight personality,

10:07.162 --> 10:10.230
there's a Frauelein Maria
just waiting to break out.

10:10.232 --> 10:11.364
I got somebody hired here

10:11.366 --> 10:12.666
who seemed like a good
person to work with,

10:12.668 --> 10:14.835
and she wound up being
difficult and bossy.

10:14.837 --> 10:16.369
- My mom?
- Exactly.

10:16.371 --> 10:17.260
Mm.

10:17.263 --> 10:20.240
I tried talking to Mr. Peters
in the teachers' lounge,

10:20.242 --> 10:22.375
you know, gay to gay,

10:22.377 --> 10:25.545
but I think our bad
attitudes really set him off.

10:25.547 --> 10:27.714
I mean, he probably
threw out my Jazz apple

10:27.716 --> 10:29.583
because he prefers Red Delicious.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.885
Oh, please. Nobody likes Red Delicious.

10:31.887 --> 10:33.286
It's like biting into a sweater.

10:33.288 --> 10:34.196
That's what he said.

10:34.199 --> 10:35.755
Even though he'd probably
reject my friendship,

10:35.757 --> 10:37.057
I want to meet him and spend years

10:37.059 --> 10:38.358
trying to make him my new bestie.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.694
Not in that blouse.

10:40.696 --> 10:43.296
Wait a second.

10:43.298 --> 10:44.831
Maybe you could hang out with him.

10:44.833 --> 10:47.767
I mean, he's new to town.
I think he's just lonely.

10:47.769 --> 10:50.904
Kenny, this is Steve
we're talking about, honey.

10:50.905 --> 10:52.438
He's not nice to just anybody.

10:52.441 --> 10:54.975
It takes years to get
into his inner circle.

10:54.977 --> 10:56.309
Can he sing karaoke?

10:56.311 --> 10:57.477
20 years on Broadway.

10:57.479 --> 10:59.779
He's my new best friend.

10:59.781 --> 11:01.114
Ow.

11:04.153 --> 11:05.752
Don't mind me. Just grabbing some tongs.

11:05.754 --> 11:07.587
Got too close to the fire
and dropped mine in there.

11:07.589 --> 11:09.256
No time for tongs. You have to leave.

11:09.258 --> 11:10.757
The bishop's gonna be here any minute,

11:10.759 --> 11:12.058
and I can't have my lover in my house.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.594
I thought you didn't
like the term "lover."

11:14.596 --> 11:16.229
That's how nervous I am!

11:16.231 --> 11:18.198
And Pat is driving me crazy.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.366
What is the bishop gonna think

11:19.368 --> 11:20.767
about our perfect post-divorce family

11:20.769 --> 11:22.002
if I can't even get my ex-husband

11:22.004 --> 11:23.303
to come inside the house?

11:23.305 --> 11:25.172
Now scoot. Come on.

11:25.174 --> 11:27.140
If you're so worried about
it, just cancel the dinner.

11:27.142 --> 11:28.208
Or do what I've done

11:28.210 --> 11:29.709
when students have visited my office...

11:29.711 --> 11:31.912
Just turn out all the lights
and pretend you're not there.

11:31.914 --> 11:33.880
You can't ghost a bishop.

11:35.751 --> 11:37.617
Oh, Bishop!

11:37.619 --> 11:39.152
Hello. You must be Eileen.

11:39.154 --> 11:41.855
Yes, I am. And it is so
wonderful to meet you.

11:41.857 --> 11:42.956
You must be Pat.

11:42.958 --> 11:45.458
Oh, no, I'm not Pat.

11:45.460 --> 11:46.760
Then who are you?

11:46.762 --> 11:48.851
He's Patrick.

11:48.854 --> 11:50.870
He goes by Patrick.

11:51.033 --> 11:53.233
We're Patrick and Eileen O'Neal.

11:53.235 --> 11:54.634
Welcome to our home.

11:58.781 --> 12:01.204
Eileen, I'm only agreeing to
do this because we are lovers.

12:01.207 --> 12:03.446
- Your words, not mine.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

12:03.449 --> 12:05.080
But you should know I'm a terrible liar.

12:05.082 --> 12:06.715
I'll start down a path, I
will not be able to stop.

12:06.717 --> 12:07.816
Like that time I was late for dinner.

12:07.818 --> 12:08.917
I told you I met the mayor.

12:08.919 --> 12:10.760
I was just cruising
around a Tommy Bahama.

12:10.762 --> 12:13.129
I forgive you. Now
go be my fake husband.

12:13.131 --> 12:17.058
- Your Eminence.
- Fake husband?

12:17.060 --> 12:18.235
All right. Here's the deal.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.762
You kids know that I
think lying is very wrong,

12:20.764 --> 12:21.938
and I don't condone it,

12:21.940 --> 12:23.873
unless it involves returning
a pantsuit to Macy's

12:23.875 --> 12:25.141
after only wearing it once.

12:25.143 --> 12:27.969
But, just for tonight,
VP Murray is your father.

12:27.971 --> 12:30.786
Does he have to wear my church blazer?

12:30.789 --> 12:32.173
Well, we tried one of your father's,

12:32.175 --> 12:34.042
but it made him look
like Paula Poundstone.

12:35.579 --> 12:37.178
Bishop, how are you enjoying your soup?

12:37.180 --> 12:39.180
Patrick here was telling
me it's a family recipe.

12:39.182 --> 12:42.350
My great-great-grandmother,
Lucille O'Neal,

12:42.352 --> 12:44.653
on the ship, oh, she got so sick

12:44.655 --> 12:48.790
she had to give the recipe to
her twin sister, Bathsheba...

12:48.792 --> 12:50.091
because she was just
vomiting so force...

12:50.093 --> 12:52.093
It was like a geyser, and... Ow! Mm.

12:52.095 --> 12:53.395
We should eat quick and go upstairs

12:53.397 --> 12:55.664
so we can finish our papers
for music appreciation.

12:55.666 --> 12:56.819
- Why?
- Have a drink.

12:56.821 --> 12:58.867
You said Steve the Colorist
is taking care of it, so...

12:58.869 --> 13:00.769
Jimmy, he's not writing
your paper for you.

13:00.771 --> 13:03.238
He's taking Mr. Peters to gay karaoke.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.472
"Gay karaoke"?

13:04.474 --> 13:05.941
No. It's just, um... It's a...

13:05.943 --> 13:08.109
An expression the
teenagers use nowadays.

13:08.111 --> 13:10.378
You know, it's like,
"This food is so good,

13:10.380 --> 13:11.746
it's like gay karaoke."

13:11.748 --> 13:13.048
See?

13:13.050 --> 13:14.449
Thank you, dear.

13:16.019 --> 13:17.052
Is something burning?

13:17.054 --> 13:18.086
No, I don't think so.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.587
Oh!

13:19.589 --> 13:23.024
Do you know, the neighbor
bought a meat smoker.

13:23.026 --> 13:24.426
His name is Clive.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.660
He's a super guy.

13:25.662 --> 13:27.637
He's a vice principal.
He's got a coupon caddy.

13:27.639 --> 13:29.438
He's kind of like the
sixth member of this family.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.172
No, he's not.

13:30.175 --> 13:32.342
Then, why do you make him
do such stressful things?

13:35.347 --> 13:37.013
Why aren't you wearing a shirt?

13:37.015 --> 13:39.941
This is hard work, Shannon.

13:39.943 --> 13:42.644
It's hot, and I'm slaving
over a giant meat furnace.

13:42.646 --> 13:44.412
Also, I just learned the hard way

13:44.414 --> 13:45.714
that my shirt's highly flammable.

13:45.716 --> 13:48.383
Well, Mom's freaking out
in there, we can't breathe,

13:48.385 --> 13:50.285
and VP Murray's not great at improv.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.387
So turn off the smoker and come inside.

13:52.389 --> 13:54.756
Mm. No can do, Shannon.

13:54.758 --> 13:56.391
Pat's living in Pat's world now,

13:56.393 --> 13:58.426
population... Pat.

13:58.428 --> 14:01.096
Okay, well, forget what I said
about putting yourself first.

14:01.098 --> 14:03.431
I was wrong. We need you in there.

14:03.433 --> 14:07.435
I am feeling a freedom
I have never experienced!

14:07.437 --> 14:10.372
I'm alive!

14:10.374 --> 14:13.641
Aliiiiiiiiive!!

14:13.643 --> 14:16.077
I've created a monster.

14:16.079 --> 14:18.780
We may look modern on the outside,

14:18.782 --> 14:20.415
but we try to be traditional.

14:20.417 --> 14:22.450
Kenny O'Neal!

14:22.452 --> 14:25.353
You ruined gay karaoke for me forever.

14:25.355 --> 14:27.956
You see? Gay karaoke.

14:27.958 --> 14:29.290
Everybody's saying it.

14:29.292 --> 14:30.392
Sorry we barged in.

14:30.394 --> 14:31.659
Steve made me. He's outraged.

14:31.661 --> 14:32.761
I am outraged.

14:32.763 --> 14:34.195
You must be the bishop.

14:34.197 --> 14:35.230
Nice to meet you.

14:35.232 --> 14:36.698
I'm Pat...

14:36.700 --> 14:38.101
in case you were wondering.

14:38.104 --> 14:43.872
Oh, perhaps you and your
Boy Scout leader, Steve,

14:43.874 --> 14:48.143
would care to discuss your
merit badges in another room.

14:48.145 --> 14:50.745
What happened? Did you
take Mr. Peters out?

14:50.747 --> 14:51.913
Yeah, did you get him to lighten up?

14:51.915 --> 14:53.112
Is he canceling class tomorrow?

14:53.114 --> 14:54.282
No, he didn't lighten up.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.051
He critiqued everyone's performance.

14:56.053 --> 14:57.385
You made him sound like he was fun-mean,

14:57.387 --> 14:58.453
but he was just mean-mean.

14:58.455 --> 14:59.788
He made Mateo cry.

14:59.790 --> 15:01.890
Well, his ear is
trained to hear mistakes.

15:01.892 --> 15:02.991
I mean, he's a music teacher.

15:02.993 --> 15:04.125
He spent 20 years on Broadway.

15:04.127 --> 15:06.489
As an usher for "Tony
'n' Tina's Wedding."

15:06.492 --> 15:08.263
You should not be saying
anything bad about him.

15:08.265 --> 15:09.664
We need to support each other.

15:09.666 --> 15:11.066
Why? Because we're gay?

15:11.068 --> 15:13.301
Wake up, girl. Not all
gay people are great.

15:13.303 --> 15:14.636
Clearly.

15:14.638 --> 15:18.273
Okay. I'm done with you.

15:19.242 --> 15:21.009
If you compromise my relationship

15:21.011 --> 15:23.478
with Steve the Colorist,
I'll never do your bang again.

15:27.350 --> 15:28.917
Great. Just great.

15:28.919 --> 15:30.518
Your plan with Mr. Peters didn't work,

15:30.520 --> 15:32.454
and now I have to write
a paper on Carmen Electra.

15:32.456 --> 15:33.621
It's "Carmina Burana."

15:33.623 --> 15:35.390
I-Is that her mom?

15:35.392 --> 15:36.791
Well, maybe this is a chance

15:36.793 --> 15:38.259
for you to actually try for once.

15:38.261 --> 15:39.294
Maybe you'll learn something.

15:39.296 --> 15:41.129
Oh! You sound just like Dad.

15:41.131 --> 15:44.499
I'm talking Crazy Meat Dad,
not Paula Poundstone Dad.

15:44.501 --> 15:46.167
In the words of Steve the Colorist,

15:46.169 --> 15:47.602
I'm done with you.

15:51.274 --> 15:53.074
I have five brothers. One's name is...

15:53.076 --> 15:54.317
- Patrick?
- Hmm?

15:54.319 --> 15:56.219
You have shared so much,

15:56.221 --> 15:58.087
and I think maybe it's just a... a lot

15:58.089 --> 15:59.989
for the bishop to digest.

15:59.991 --> 16:01.858
It's just, having you here

16:01.860 --> 16:03.551
is such a wonderful confirmation

16:03.553 --> 16:05.453
that even though our
family's unconventional,

16:05.455 --> 16:07.021
you know, God hasn't rejected us.

16:12.829 --> 16:15.029
Well, that's just poor timing.

16:15.031 --> 16:16.498
I am sweating through my collar.

16:16.500 --> 16:17.899
- Can we open a window?
- Oh.

16:17.901 --> 16:20.502
I'll do it. I replaced all
the windows last summer.

16:20.504 --> 16:22.003
Just the kind of guy I am.

16:22.005 --> 16:24.572
Also, I'm a cop.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.542
Oh!

16:27.544 --> 16:29.410
It feels like we're dining in hell.

16:29.412 --> 16:31.479
Well, we're all gonna be in heaven...

16:31.481 --> 16:34.616
in a few minutes when
we try Eileen's dessert.

16:34.618 --> 16:35.783
Oh, what'd you make?

16:35.785 --> 16:38.653
I'm defrosting a
cheesecake in the bathtub.

16:38.655 --> 16:39.988
It's going to be delicious.

16:39.990 --> 16:43.091
The smoke is really bothering my asthma.

16:43.093 --> 16:44.392
I'm going to get some air.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.861
The front porch has better air!

16:48.740 --> 16:50.440
You must be the neighbor, Clive.

16:50.442 --> 16:51.975
Oh.

16:51.977 --> 16:55.378
No. I'm Pat O'Neal, Eileen's
ex-husband. How are you?

16:55.380 --> 16:57.947
If you're Pat, who's he?

16:57.949 --> 17:00.750
Well, it's a long
story, but I can tell it.

17:00.752 --> 17:05.613
Um, strangely enough, our
tale begins in a shtetl.

17:05.615 --> 17:06.923
- Okay. That's enough.
- I...

17:06.925 --> 17:08.892
I can't let you lie for me anymore.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.885
Bishop, here's the truth.

17:11.845 --> 17:15.424
The person you thought
was Pat is actually...

17:15.425 --> 17:17.458
my gentleman friend, Clive,

17:17.460 --> 17:20.595
who is a very important
part of this family.

17:20.597 --> 17:23.897
And the shirtless man
over there by the meat

17:23.900 --> 17:28.002
is actually my ex-husband and
the father of my children, Pat.

17:28.003 --> 17:30.004
No. He's not.

17:30.006 --> 17:32.382
That man is not my father.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.842
My real father is a sweet man

17:34.844 --> 17:37.420
who always puts other people's
needs before his own...

17:37.422 --> 17:39.522
until I trained that out of him.

17:39.524 --> 17:41.235
But the real Pat O'Neal

17:41.238 --> 17:43.417
is the glue that holds
this family together.

17:43.420 --> 17:46.721
Honey, that's so sweet.

17:46.723 --> 17:48.890
Am I allowed to say that's sweet?

17:48.892 --> 17:50.191
Yes.

17:50.193 --> 17:51.726
Most divorced dads move away

17:51.728 --> 17:53.194
and start new families elsewhere,

17:53.196 --> 17:57.198
but you moved into the
garage to stay closer to us.

17:57.200 --> 18:01.202
You moved into this garage
to be closer to your children?

18:02.672 --> 18:06.007
Um, it is a tiny house, and, yes, I did.

18:06.009 --> 18:07.976
I-It's honestly the
only way we've been able

18:07.978 --> 18:10.245
to make it work since the divorce.

18:10.247 --> 18:12.046
It's messy, and it's hard,

18:12.048 --> 18:15.817
and the truth is, we are not
the poster family for anything,

18:15.819 --> 18:16.884
except maybe meat.

18:16.886 --> 18:19.520
I appreciate your honesty.

18:19.522 --> 18:21.589
I've done this long enough
to know no one's perfect.

18:21.591 --> 18:25.994
It's how we deal with our
imperfections that defines us.

18:25.996 --> 18:29.631
For example, my cardiologist
told me to stay away from meat,

18:29.633 --> 18:33.268
but I really feel like that
brisket is calling my name.

18:33.270 --> 18:34.235
May I?

18:34.237 --> 18:36.537
Yeah? Sure.

18:36.539 --> 18:38.773
- There you go.
- Hm.

18:41.011 --> 18:42.744
Mmm.

18:44.063 --> 18:45.780
It's like gay karaoke.

18:48.151 --> 18:50.451
Ironically, "Carmina
Burana" was written by clergy

18:50.453 --> 18:52.920
when the Latin idiom
was the lingua franca.

18:52.922 --> 18:55.156
Yeah, dude, I was surprised, too.

18:55.158 --> 18:57.558
And that's why Carl Orff's
famous scenic cantata

18:57.560 --> 18:58.893
can only be described as...

18:58.895 --> 19:01.037
And I don't like to use
these words lightly...

19:01.039 --> 19:02.338
"balls to the wall."

19:02.340 --> 19:03.740
Whoo!

19:06.202 --> 19:07.702
Not bad work, Mr. O'Neal.

19:07.704 --> 19:09.904
Thanks. I worked on it all night.

19:09.906 --> 19:12.040
That's why my hair looks so weird.

19:12.042 --> 19:14.375
But the assignment was for
a 1,000-word presentation.

19:14.377 --> 19:15.777
You were two words short.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.112
Okay, um...

19:18.114 --> 19:19.947
"The end."

19:19.949 --> 19:22.150
Clever, but that doesn't count.

19:22.152 --> 19:24.052
You fail. Now, moving on...

19:24.054 --> 19:26.721
Wait a second. Now you're
just picking on him.

19:26.723 --> 19:29.257
Jimmy has never worked
this hard on anything,

19:29.259 --> 19:31.526
and it's not like you actually
counted all of those words.

19:31.528 --> 19:32.660
Of course I did.

19:32.662 --> 19:34.028
This is an official usher's counter

19:34.030 --> 19:35.229
from a Broadway theater.

19:35.231 --> 19:37.632
Okay, but there's no way on earth

19:37.634 --> 19:39.000
you can count words that quickly.

19:39.002 --> 19:41.102
That was 13.

19:41.104 --> 19:44.405
You know what, Mr. Peters?

19:44.407 --> 19:46.274
I really thought that you
were going to be somebody

19:46.276 --> 19:48.309
I could look up to and emulate...

19:48.311 --> 19:49.811
A gay inspiration.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.914
The truth is, you're a bad role model.

19:52.916 --> 19:54.782
You're not fun-mean.

19:54.784 --> 19:56.250
You're just mean-mean.

19:56.252 --> 19:58.353
You want to see mean? You fail, too.

19:58.355 --> 20:00.822
Okay! That is not fair!

20:00.824 --> 20:02.724
His presentation was
twice as long as mine.

20:02.726 --> 20:04.025
I mean, he said "in conclusion,"

20:04.027 --> 20:05.493
and then he spoke for
another 10 minutes.

20:05.495 --> 20:06.761
All right. That's enough from you two.

20:06.763 --> 20:08.496
I want you both to go
see Vice Principal Murray.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.565
Oh, you mean the man that we
had breakfast with this morning

20:10.567 --> 20:11.966
who was wearing our mom's robe?

20:11.968 --> 20:15.169
Gladly. And we'll be having
a word with him about you.

20:15.171 --> 20:16.637
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you know what?

20:16.639 --> 20:18.840
"Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding"
isn't even a Broadway show.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.842
It's glorified dinner theater.

20:23.757 --> 20:25.178
I am ready to share my knowledge.

20:25.181 --> 20:26.780
What exactly do you want to know?

20:26.783 --> 20:28.216
All kinds of things.

20:28.219 --> 20:31.889
Like, at what point do I tell
my eye doctor that I'm gay?

20:31.891 --> 20:33.424
He knows. Next?

20:33.426 --> 20:36.160
Did you participate
in the Stonewall riots?

20:36.162 --> 20:38.296
Yeah. I threw my teddy bear at a cop.

20:38.298 --> 20:39.563
How old do you think I am?

20:39.565 --> 20:41.933
Don't answer that! It's a trap.

20:41.935 --> 20:44.769
Ms. Dunn, you look gorgeous.

20:44.771 --> 20:46.304
Do you do cats?

20:46.306 --> 20:48.339
I want to give General Kitten a perm.

20:48.341 --> 20:49.640
Absolutely.

20:49.642 --> 20:52.610
Now, let's talk about the gay
history that really matters.

20:52.612 --> 20:55.112
In the summer of 1958,
the Ciccone family

20:55.114 --> 20:56.747
welcomed a young girl into the world.

20:56.749 --> 20:58.149
Her name was Madonna.

20:58.151 --> 21:00.017
Yes.
