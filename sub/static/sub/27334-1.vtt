WEBVTT

00:34.411 --> 00:37.706
It's fucking bullshit!

00:37.789 --> 00:39.332
Oh, my God. Shut the fuck up!

00:39.541 --> 00:40.625
You shut the fuck up!

00:40.709 --> 00:42.043
- Fuck you!
- You are out of line!

00:45.338 --> 00:46.881
Get the fuck out of my way.

00:46.965 --> 00:48.425
Don't worry about
my fucking grades, you bitch!

00:48.508 --> 00:51.052
What are you doing all day?

00:51.136 --> 00:52.679
I'm your fucking mother!
Get back here!

00:52.762 --> 00:54.139
Don't fucking touch me!

00:54.806 --> 00:56.474
Get out of my way!

00:56.558 --> 00:58.601
You're blocking the fucking door!

00:59.144 --> 01:00.854
Get the fuck out of my way!

01:00.937 --> 01:01.980
Call her by yourself.

01:02.063 --> 01:04.274
Know what?
You suck, you little fucker!

01:04.357 --> 01:05.650
For real, where are the car keys?

01:05.734 --> 01:07.736
What the fuck?
If you don't get the fuck out of my way--

01:10.697 --> 01:12.282
Don't worry about my fucking shoes!

01:39.100 --> 01:40.894
Stay out of my fucking room, Stevie.

02:29.609 --> 02:30.652
'Sup, fool?

04:47.246 --> 04:49.165
I haven't called that guy, Todd, back yet.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.335
He's fine.

04:53.795 --> 04:55.213
I'm attracted to him.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.257
Oh.

04:59.384 --> 05:01.386
He seems a bit playerish to me though.

05:03.680 --> 05:07.016
I always have to remember to hit "pause"
when I start feeling something.

05:10.019 --> 05:12.230
- Orange juice.
- Please.

05:15.233 --> 05:19.320
Jesus. At my 18th birthday party,
I was breastfeeding you.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.408
Can you imagine having a baby right now?

05:35.003 --> 05:36.129
Ian.

05:36.212 --> 05:37.213
I, uh...

05:38.548 --> 05:39.549
I got you something.

05:40.842 --> 05:42.176
I know you don't have this one.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.505
I love me a mature woman, though.

06:21.007 --> 06:23.509
You know--
Hey, you sexy ladies wanna see a trick?

06:23.593 --> 06:25.553
- Mm-hmm.
- Right here.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.645
Get the fuck out of
the front of my store. Where's Ken?

06:35.104 --> 06:36.689
- Fuck you, man.
- Not here!

06:36.773 --> 06:38.024
I'm not fucking scared of you guys.

06:38.524 --> 06:41.319
I fought in fucking Desert Storm,
you fucking pussies.

06:42.695 --> 06:44.530
Go back inside, dumb ass.

06:45.782 --> 06:48.284
- Don't even bother.
- Fuck you!

07:13.726 --> 07:16.270
<i>Right now, you know,
we're just maxing in the studio.</i>

07:16.354 --> 07:18.189
<i>We're hailing from East Oakland
in California,</i>

07:18.272 --> 07:21.234
<i>and, you know, sometimes
it gets a little hectic out there.</i>

07:21.317 --> 07:24.153
<i>But, right know, yo,
we're going up in an hour. Check this.</i>

07:44.882 --> 07:46.259
What is wrong with your brain?

07:50.680 --> 07:53.599
That's probably the worst
"would you rather" I've ever heard.

07:53.683 --> 07:55.560
What about, would you rather...

07:56.894 --> 07:58.437
suck you dad's dick...

07:59.939 --> 08:01.440
or eat your mom out?

08:01.524 --> 08:03.109
- What the fuck?
- What?

08:03.192 --> 08:04.777
Oh, my gosh.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.822
- What kind of conversation is this, bro?
- Yeah, yo.

08:08.406 --> 08:09.740
- Fuckshit.
- What's up?

08:09.824 --> 08:12.160
Would you rather suck your dad dick

08:12.243 --> 08:13.077
or eat your mom out?

08:13.161 --> 08:14.579
You would suck your dad's dick, right?

08:14.662 --> 08:16.289
- Shut the fuck up.
- That's not a weird answer.

08:16.372 --> 08:17.373
Shut up, Fourth Grade.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.833
- Shut the fuck up.
- Life or death. Come on.

08:18.916 --> 08:21.586
Hey, whatever I'm doing,
I'm druggin' one of them motherfuckers.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.881
I'm not gonna say who,
but I'm gonna drug the motherfuckers

08:25.756 --> 08:27.091
till they sleep.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.218
- You're gonna rape your parents?
- Shit.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.512
- Huh?
- That's, like, that's rape.

08:31.596 --> 08:34.890
I'd rather rape one of my parents
than to consciously--

08:34.974 --> 08:36.893
Yo, what the fuck?

08:36.976 --> 08:39.102
I'm not tripping.
Life or death.

08:39.187 --> 08:41.563
Life or death.
Fuck it, I just raped my parents.

08:41.647 --> 08:45.276
Or one of 'em.

08:47.195 --> 08:49.030
Hey, for real,
I'm never coming back here again.

08:49.113 --> 08:51.991
- Wow.
- Y'all niggas scaring off customers.

08:52.074 --> 08:55.286
This is not a accurate representation
of what we usually talk about.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.205
Y'all are bad for business, my nigga.

08:57.288 --> 09:00.082
Is there any way that you could just,
like, forget I even asked.

09:00.666 --> 09:03.085
- I feel really weird now.
- Oh, hell no.

09:06.255 --> 09:09.467
Yo, these niggas are in Paris

09:10.426 --> 09:13.638
eating nice dinners,
staying at nice hotels.

09:14.430 --> 09:17.308
I've been to France before.
Them niggas are assholes.

09:18.476 --> 09:23.272
Yeah, but you were with your parents.
Like, imagine if that was us.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.003
<i>How much cash you got?</i>

09:49.215 --> 09:50.383
I don't have any.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.885
I'll trade you for your Discman.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.183
Well, it's just that
I use my Discman all the time.

10:00.226 --> 10:03.229
Mom gave it to my for my birthday
and Christmas.

10:03.312 --> 10:07.274
Wait, wait! I'll give you anything in
this room, just not the Discman, please.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.121
You don't even
fucking know about music anyway.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.727
It's Saturday. Blockbuster night.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.770
<i>What do you wanna watch?</i>

10:44.854 --> 10:47.898
<i>Sorry. I wanna skate.</i>

11:17.470 --> 11:21.557
- <i>Look at this. It's beautiful.</i>
<i>- I like this one.</i>

11:21.640 --> 11:23.726
<i>One dog goes one way
and the other dog goes the other way.</i>

11:23.809 --> 11:26.520
<i>One is going east,
and the other is going west. So what?</i>

11:26.604 --> 11:28.230
<i>And this guy's saying,
"What do you want from me?"</i>

12:00.262 --> 12:01.263
Fuck!

12:04.892 --> 12:06.644
I'm skating like shit today, man.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.231
Looks cool to me.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.483
I'm Ruben.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.609
I'm Stevie.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.196
Let me get some water.

12:21.283 --> 12:22.785
Damn, you already drank all of it?

12:22.868 --> 12:24.036
Fill that up, man.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.874
Yo, Stevie, go fill this up, yo.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.584
Yeah!

12:41.178 --> 12:42.096
Thanks, little man.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.813
Whoo! Refreshing.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.137
Shit, this is relaxing.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.557
You smoke?

13:27.975 --> 13:30.352
Yeah. These one's are just...
different brand.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.439
Thank you.

13:34.523 --> 13:35.858
What are you, gay?

13:36.191 --> 13:37.651
- What?
- Why the fuck you thanking me?

13:37.735 --> 13:40.654
Don't fucking thank people, man.
It's faggot as fuck, yo.

13:40.738 --> 13:43.240
- Oh, sorry. I didn't know that.
- It's fine. Now you know.

13:43.324 --> 13:45.743
Just don't thank people.
They're gonna think you're gay.

13:46.118 --> 13:47.369
Oh, I won't do it again.

13:47.453 --> 13:49.455
Yeah, you gotta fucking
pay attention to me, man.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.874
I'm a fucking badass.
You're a little-ass kid.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.334
You should fucking look up to me.

13:53.417 --> 13:54.668
I smoke.

13:56.462 --> 13:57.379
I skate.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.132
- I fuck bitches.
- Dang.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.718
I'm pretty much the shit.
I'm living the life.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.595
All you have
is this fucking dinosaur board.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.639
That shit is '80s as fuck.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.850
It's got, like, a neon dinosaur
and it's screaming "Cowabunga."

14:09.934 --> 14:11.101
You look retarded.

14:11.185 --> 14:13.562
You gotta get a new fucking board, man.

14:13.646 --> 14:14.480
How much are they?

14:14.563 --> 14:17.316
I don't know.
Probably, like, $120 for a complete.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.943
I'll sell you my used setup for $40.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.694
It's a good-ass deal for you.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.571
Wait. Don't you need your board?

14:22.655 --> 14:24.615
I'm saving up to buy a new Motor board.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.075
Well, thanks for selling.

14:26.784 --> 14:29.954
See? I was about to say "thank you,"
but now I know how gay that is.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.748
Don't fucking say that shit either.
Just say nothing. Fuck.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.124
Sorry.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.418
God, you're such a fucking little kid.

14:36.502 --> 14:37.503
Fuck, man.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.839
What time is it?

14:40.923 --> 14:42.257
I don't know. Probably, like, 8:00.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.260
Oh, man. I gotta go, man.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.930
You don't have to be home at certain time?

14:48.013 --> 14:49.932
No, I always go home
after my mom's asleep.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.477
See you tomorrow?

14:54.186 --> 14:56.063
- Yeah.
- With 40 bucks?

14:57.147 --> 14:58.649
- Maybe.
- It's a fucking good deal.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.651
I gotta go, but I will.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.194
All right, you better have $40 tomorrow.

15:03.487 --> 15:04.488
Fucking idiot.

15:43.152 --> 15:44.945
I'm so sorry I'm late.
It won't ever happen again.

15:45.696 --> 15:46.822
It's only 7:30.

15:48.449 --> 15:49.366
Oh.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.160
Okay.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.710
Don't be a pussy.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.087
It doesn't feel right.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.131
You came to me.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.009
You needed 40 bucks.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.720
That's a lot of fucking money.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.017
Grab $40 for you and $40 for me.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.649
All right,
you're acting like a little fucking bitch!

16:22.733 --> 16:23.692
Fine, fine, fine!

16:26.653 --> 16:27.654
I'll do it.

17:37.933 --> 17:38.851
Sick!

17:38.934 --> 17:40.435
I'm gonna set this shit up.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.775
All right, I got one.

17:47.568 --> 17:49.278
I don't understand this shit.

17:49.361 --> 17:51.321
Why do they say Mexicans are lazy?

17:51.405 --> 17:53.574
Why the fuck you looking at me?
Do people say that shit?

17:53.657 --> 17:55.409
I heard this shit.
It don't make sense to me.

17:55.492 --> 17:59.204
Every time I see a Mexican, them niggas
is fucking building buildings and shit.

17:59.288 --> 18:00.330
That's fucked up, yo.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.249
I said people say it, not I say it.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.334
The whole point of this game
is so you don't get offended.

18:04.418 --> 18:07.337
I do have a question for Fourth Grade.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.715
Why are white people
just in love with they pets?

18:09.798 --> 18:12.426
Like, why do they care so--
I don't get it.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.677
For real!

18:13.760 --> 18:16.722
For real, though. So, I'm at this
white girl house, right, and we chilling.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.765
I can hear her mom downstairs, like,

18:18.849 --> 18:21.476
"Oh, my God.
Eric didn't eat his kibble today."

18:21.560 --> 18:24.438
Like, "I don't know." Like, "I think
we need to take him to the doctor."

18:24.521 --> 18:27.149
So, I asked, "Why is your mom feeding
your little brother kibble?

18:27.232 --> 18:29.151
Like, of course
he's probably gonna get sick."

18:29.234 --> 18:30.819
She go turn around and tell me,

18:30.903 --> 18:32.863
"Eric is the dog, silly."

18:32.946 --> 18:35.073
Dogs don't have feelings, you dumb bitch.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.785
I don't even have a dog. I have a gecko.

18:39.995 --> 18:42.831
Did this nigga just say he's got a gecko?

18:42.915 --> 18:44.041
You got a gecko?

18:44.124 --> 18:46.043
Yeah.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.879
I don't know one nigga in the world
with a fucking gecko.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.923
All right, I have one.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.969
- Can black people--
- Oh, be careful.

18:56.053 --> 18:57.429
Okay, well,

18:57.512 --> 19:00.474
- is it cool to be black?
- What the fuck?

19:00.557 --> 19:03.227
Nigga that's where I get
all my looks from, nigga.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.770
Silky-ass, sexy hair.

19:04.853 --> 19:07.105
Yeah, black don't crack.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.191
That's why I'm 17 and look 12 nigga.

19:09.274 --> 19:12.027
What you?
Seventeen and look like fucking Mr. Burns.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.031
I guess sometimes,
like, say we go skate in Beverly Hills.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.033
Everybody's already looking at us, like,

19:18.116 --> 19:20.118
"Hey, you guys are vandalizing property,"

19:20.202 --> 19:22.120
and, like, "Get the fuck outta here."
Blah, blah blah.

19:22.746 --> 19:26.875
But sometimes I feel like it's
a little bit, like, extra heavy on me.

19:26.959 --> 19:27.793
Yeah.

19:27.876 --> 19:30.045
People judge you and stuff,
but fuck it, yo.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.838
Those people are ignorant.

19:31.922 --> 19:33.423
All right.
I got another one.

19:33.507 --> 19:36.051
Can black people get sunburned?

19:36.134 --> 19:38.553
Oh, my God!

19:38.637 --> 19:40.097
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

19:40.180 --> 19:41.515
Seriously, I genuinely wanna know.

19:41.598 --> 19:44.309
Like, every time it's hot out,
I'm, like, "Does he need sunscreen?"

19:44.393 --> 19:46.311
Is there, like, black suntan lotion, or--

19:46.395 --> 19:48.188
You a real dumbass.

19:48.272 --> 19:51.024
Just when I thought you had a brain, bro.
You dumb as hell.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.944
What about you, little man?

19:56.154 --> 19:58.240
Did you know that black people
could get sunburned?

20:11.461 --> 20:13.005
What are-- What are black people?

20:22.222 --> 20:26.059
- Fuck, shit, that was dope.
- That's dope. I like that. I like that.

20:28.729 --> 20:31.023
Yeah, but...
Y'all try and go skate?

20:31.106 --> 20:32.774
- Let's go.
- I'm down.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.235
- Ruben, you try and go skate?
- Yeah.

20:36.945 --> 20:39.364
All right, then let's go.
You coming, Sunburn?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.700
"Sunburn."

20:43.243 --> 20:44.745
All right, come on then.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.121
"Sunburn."

20:50.751 --> 20:52.085
What the fuck was that?

20:53.545 --> 20:54.838
I dunno.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.490
Come on. Toss your board over.

22:05.075 --> 22:06.660
Today, motherfucker.

22:10.122 --> 22:11.540
What the fuck?

22:17.421 --> 22:20.924
Fuck, shit.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.135
Sunburn can take a fucking slam.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.557
So, you're Sunburn now?

22:30.392 --> 22:32.811
How come some people
have nicknames and some don't?

22:34.604 --> 22:35.605
I dunno.

22:36.606 --> 22:37.858
Ray doesn't.

22:37.941 --> 22:41.194
He's the coolest.
Think it's better not to have one.

22:41.278 --> 22:43.196
Yeah. Ray is awesome.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.533
And he doesn't have one.
That's, like, way cooler, for sure.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.452
You see that?

22:48.535 --> 22:49.828
Why's his name Fuckshit?

22:51.288 --> 22:55.333
'Cause anytime he sees a dope trick, he
yells out, "Fuck, shit, that was dope."

22:56.001 --> 22:58.044
Fuck, shit, that was dope.

22:59.171 --> 23:02.507
Yeah. Ray is awesome.
He skates just like in the videos.

23:02.924 --> 23:04.426
Yeah. He's fucking insane.

23:05.552 --> 23:06.970
Ever since I've met him,

23:07.053 --> 23:10.599
he's gone from, like,
dope to, like, next-level dope.

23:10.682 --> 23:12.225
Like, pro dope.

23:13.518 --> 23:15.770
Him and Fuckshit
have pretty much the same tricks,

23:15.854 --> 23:17.856
but Ray just has the sickest style ever.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.649
- Yeah.
- Fucking sick!

23:22.319 --> 23:24.070
Why's his nickname Fourth Grade?

23:24.154 --> 23:26.781
'Cause he's as smart
as a fourth grader.

23:29.868 --> 23:30.952
Can I call him that?

23:32.120 --> 23:33.497
I wouldn't call anyone anything yet.

23:35.874 --> 23:37.751
Do you know
where the bathroom is?

23:37.834 --> 23:39.169
Yeah.

24:00.357 --> 24:01.650
Fuck! Shit!

24:04.236 --> 24:05.904
Hey!

24:05.987 --> 24:07.531
- One of these.
- Hey!

24:07.614 --> 24:09.783
Y'all not supposed to be around here.
Get the fuck out.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.034
- Hey, come here!
- Shut up.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.285
Don't throw rocks at me.

24:12.369 --> 24:13.203
Fuck you.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.205
Lil man,
get the fuck off the property, all right?

24:15.288 --> 24:16.873
- Bitch.
- I said, come here.

24:16.957 --> 24:18.458
Sunburn. Sunburn, what're you doing?

24:18.542 --> 24:20.919
Don't get fucked up like the rest
of these little niggas. Come here.

24:22.212 --> 24:24.089
Don't let them
get you fucked up. Come here.

24:24.172 --> 24:26.049
- You're not even a real cop.
- He be a rent-a-cop.

24:26.132 --> 24:26.967
Sunburn!

24:27.050 --> 24:28.385
Stevie!
This nigga's a rent-a-cop.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.594
- Hey, no, come here.
- Sunburn!

24:29.678 --> 24:30.887
Same to you, rent-a-cop.

24:30.971 --> 24:32.847
Fuck you, nigga.
I make more than all you.

24:32.931 --> 24:34.558
- Nigga!
- Man, fuck you.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.351
What the fuck you doing
skating with these white boys?

24:36.434 --> 24:37.644
Niggas don't skate.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.479
Yo, surf's up, motherfucker.

24:39.563 --> 24:40.647
That's who you think you are?

24:40.730 --> 24:42.816
Hey. The little nigga with the Toys-R-Us
badge. Come here.

24:42.899 --> 24:44.192
You can't say nigga, I don't think.

24:44.276 --> 24:46.611
You fucking Sheryl Crow-looking
motherfucker.

24:46.695 --> 24:49.155
I don't know who that is, but bitch,
fuck you.

24:49.239 --> 24:51.157
You look Samoan, motherfucker.

24:51.241 --> 24:53.159
You're a Samoan-ass nigga.

24:53.243 --> 24:55.829
All right, that was funny.
That was pretty funny. That was funny.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.038
Get the fuck outta here.

24:57.581 --> 24:59.332
What the fuck is wrong with you?

24:59.416 --> 25:02.627
You know that's a fucking felony, right?
<i>Ese.</i>

25:02.711 --> 25:03.712
You're a rent-a-cop.

25:03.795 --> 25:05.338
You'll be in fuckin' prison
with your uncle.

25:05.422 --> 25:06.798
Well, hop the fence then, bitch.

25:06.881 --> 25:08.592
- You hop the fence.
- Oh, all right.

25:08.675 --> 25:09.926
You hop the fence, motherfucker.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.845
I'll hop the fence right now
and whup your ass.

25:11.928 --> 25:14.639
- Hey, beat that nigga's ass.
- No you don't, lil nigga.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.726
- Stay right there, lil nigga.
- I'm gonna hop the fence.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.269
Where you going?

25:19.352 --> 25:21.313
- Now I'm in your face. Hop the fence.
- Man, fuck you, nigga.

25:21.396 --> 25:22.814
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.816
- You need Jesus.
- No. No, you need Jesus.

25:24.899 --> 25:26.693
You smoking cigarettes on school property.

25:26.776 --> 25:29.696
The Bible is pro-cigarettes, nigga.
Jesus smoked cigarettes.

25:29.779 --> 25:31.406
Oh, yeah? What kinda cigarettes he smoked?

25:31.489 --> 25:33.491
Jesus smoked-- Jesus smoked Kools, nigga.

25:40.624 --> 25:43.877
This is awesome. I've never been in a car
with someone's mom or dad before.

25:44.669 --> 25:47.881
Stevie, keep that shit
to yourself man, fuck.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.007
Sorry.

26:05.440 --> 26:08.068
- Are we allowed to skate here?
- Fuck no, it's super illegal.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.819
It's a fucking courthouse.

26:09.903 --> 26:12.822
If you hear anyone yell out "Five-O,"
just fucking take off.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.452
See those fucking bums?

26:17.535 --> 26:20.163
If one of them offers you
something to smoke, don't smoke it.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.623
It's probably fucking crack.

26:42.686 --> 26:46.481
Whoa! Those are pros.
I saw those guys on <i>Big Brother.</i>

26:46.564 --> 26:48.400
Yeah, they ride for Chocolate.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.235
So fucking sick.

26:51.986 --> 26:54.823
And they, like,
skate here where you guys skate?

26:54.906 --> 26:56.574
Yeah, yo. Everyone skates here.

26:59.661 --> 27:00.870
That's sick.

27:00.954 --> 27:02.163
Oh, yeah.

27:13.591 --> 27:14.592
Hey, Sunburn.

27:17.887 --> 27:18.847
You got an extra smoke?

27:18.930 --> 27:20.765
You got a quarter?
You got an extra quarter?

27:20.849 --> 27:22.475
Aw, man, come on.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.144
I'm just playing. Come sit down.

27:24.227 --> 27:25.729
- I got a full pack.
- All right.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.147
- Sure.
- Thanks, man.

27:27.230 --> 27:28.231
You bet.

27:28.857 --> 27:30.567
- Needed this.
- How you doin'? What's good in your life?

27:31.818 --> 27:33.403
Um, I'm here, shit.

27:34.404 --> 27:36.322
I'm tryin' to get up off the streets, man.

27:37.282 --> 27:38.742
Before the streets get me.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.243
Hmm.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.745
But see, I look like this, so--

27:42.412 --> 27:43.705
Ain't nobody wanna fuck with you.

27:43.788 --> 27:44.789
Yeah. You feel me?

27:44.873 --> 27:47.000
My friends or whatever, they kinda just--

27:47.083 --> 27:48.877
Ain't no judging up in here.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.044
Oh, okay.

27:50.128 --> 27:52.088
So, let me ask you as question, man.

27:52.172 --> 27:54.048
What y'all doin' with the skating?

27:54.132 --> 27:55.467
Ah, I just have fun skatin'.

27:55.550 --> 27:59.262
It's, like-- It makes me happy and smile.
So I just skate every day.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.972
- Oh, okay. I can dig it.
- Yeah.

28:01.055 --> 28:03.933
Yeah, it's fun as hell,
but I'm tryin' to make a way.

28:04.017 --> 28:05.018
Oh, okay.

28:05.101 --> 28:06.603
You can do that with skating?

28:07.312 --> 28:09.564
Yeah if you-- if you focused.

28:10.398 --> 28:11.524
- Oh, damn.
- There's pros.

28:12.692 --> 28:13.777
I wanna be one of 'em.

28:13.860 --> 28:17.113
That seems crazy to me
that you can get a job skating.

28:17.197 --> 28:18.448
Yeah.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.992
I'm thinking,
"Man, maybe I shoulda started skating."

28:21.075 --> 28:22.494
What was your last job?

28:22.577 --> 28:24.329
Man, I was in a data entry.

28:24.996 --> 28:28.875
You know, everything kinda
takes some kinda artistic mind to do.

28:28.958 --> 28:31.002
Or creative mind to do.

28:31.085 --> 28:32.837
You can't just be a robot.
You know what I'm sayin'?

28:32.921 --> 28:34.756
You gotta be able to come up with ideas.

28:34.839 --> 28:36.007
- Yeah.
- So...

28:36.090 --> 28:40.094
I'm starting to feel more like that,
but I still got the old programming in me.

28:40.178 --> 28:43.223
I guess, from school.
I'm thinkin' about a lotta stuff out here.

28:43.306 --> 28:45.725
Do you understand why
we ride a piece of wood?

28:45.809 --> 28:50.814
Why we push just on a piece of wood, like,
what that does to somebody's spirit.

28:50.897 --> 28:51.898
You know?

28:51.981 --> 28:53.942
Just tryin' to keep
a positive attitude

28:54.692 --> 28:56.110
even though it's hard as hell.

28:56.194 --> 28:59.864
But I'm glad that y'all sat down with me
and talked with me for a minute.

28:59.948 --> 29:01.658
Man, that, that helps actually a lot.

29:01.741 --> 29:03.493
You're a good dude, man.

29:03.576 --> 29:04.494
Right on, man.

29:12.168 --> 29:14.879
Hey, Five-O! Five-O!

30:05.555 --> 30:06.431
Later, guys.

30:06.514 --> 30:07.557
- Later.
- Bye.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.558
Peace.

30:37.045 --> 30:39.797
Bitch! You don't listen
to anything I say. Ask him.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.674
Stevie, can you get out here, honey?

30:43.384 --> 30:45.345
There he is.
Fucking ask him yourself.

30:47.972 --> 30:50.892
Stevie, there's $80 missing from my room.

30:51.684 --> 30:54.812
I know Ian did it.
He's saying you did it with him.

30:56.147 --> 30:57.106
Did you?

31:00.318 --> 31:01.235
No.

31:04.364 --> 31:05.281
Okay.

31:17.835 --> 31:19.212
Yes!

31:19.295 --> 31:20.797
Oh!

31:20.880 --> 31:21.965
Yes!

31:23.132 --> 31:24.842
Oh, my God! I did it! I did it! I did it!

31:24.926 --> 31:28.012
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

31:30.682 --> 31:31.599
Oh, my God!

31:52.370 --> 31:56.332
Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

32:03.089 --> 32:04.507
Fuck!

32:09.303 --> 32:11.639
Two weeks, nigga? What the fuck?

32:11.723 --> 32:15.476
I know. My parents seen
my report card. They were fucking pissed.

32:15.560 --> 32:19.188
No car for two weeks.
So you might as well cut my dick off.

32:19.856 --> 32:21.566
My parents are fucking retarded.

32:21.649 --> 32:22.775
I'm a junior in high school.

32:22.859 --> 32:25.987
It's not like all of a sudden I'm about
to get into Harvard or some shit.

32:27.030 --> 32:29.615
Like, my parents did that. They get paid.

32:29.699 --> 32:32.785
I get C's, I'm cool with that.
That life's just not mine.

32:32.869 --> 32:34.370
So, what you gonna do then?

32:34.454 --> 32:37.457
Skate, have fun, go to parties.

32:37.540 --> 32:38.750
Shit, just live life.

32:40.501 --> 32:41.627
That sounds nice.

32:42.587 --> 32:44.213
All that "trying hard" shit,

32:45.048 --> 32:46.215
that shits just corny.

32:47.341 --> 32:49.051
I think that shits corny.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.304
I'm tryin' to get out the hood.
I'm tryin' to go see shit.

32:51.387 --> 32:54.599
I don't live in the hood.
I got options, nigga.

32:54.682 --> 32:56.476
Nigga, what options you got?

32:56.851 --> 32:59.187
I'm just not tryin'
to take this shit seriously.

32:59.270 --> 33:00.438
Well, good luck with that.

33:00.521 --> 33:02.315
I'm gonna send you a postcard
when I'm on tour.

33:05.735 --> 33:07.695
What about you, Fourth Grade?
What you wanna do?

33:08.488 --> 33:10.615
I don't know, just, like,
make a movie or something.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.202
This nigga think he Spielberg
or some shit.

33:14.285 --> 33:16.662
You know you gotta say words
to make movies.

33:16.746 --> 33:18.498
Nigga, I ain't heard you talk but twice.

33:18.581 --> 33:20.708
Yeah, it is a stupid idea.

33:21.584 --> 33:22.627
Yes, it was.

33:24.128 --> 33:26.964
I don't know. I guess I'll just
work at the DMV with my dad.

33:30.218 --> 33:31.594
Where you going?

33:31.677 --> 33:33.179
I'm about to go skate this gap.

33:33.262 --> 33:35.389
"Try hard. Be corny." Right?

33:36.641 --> 33:37.642
Yeah, all right.

34:00.540 --> 34:01.499
That was sick!

34:07.463 --> 34:08.464
You're up, man.

34:11.717 --> 34:12.635
Whoa!

34:12.717 --> 34:14.303
- All right, you got it, Ruben.
- Yeah.

34:27.483 --> 34:29.652
Oh, come on!
What kinda pussy shit was that?

34:31.779 --> 34:33.114
You got this, man.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.074
Shut the fuck up, faggot.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.257
Wait! Hey!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

34:52.341 --> 34:54.760
You not going fast enough! Yo! Wait! Hey!

34:56.512 --> 34:58.639
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Whoa, holy shit.

35:00.641 --> 35:02.894
Whoa! Shit! This nigga dead.

35:03.686 --> 35:05.229
Is he fucking dead, yo?

35:19.702 --> 35:21.704
- Sunburn.
- Nigga, don't poke him.

35:22.955 --> 35:24.332
Sunburn, you okay?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.044
Sunburn, you good? Stevie.

35:30.755 --> 35:31.964
Damn.

35:35.092 --> 35:36.260
You okay?

35:36.344 --> 35:37.303
Hell yeah.

35:38.429 --> 35:40.556
- Fuck! Shit!
- Oh, fuck.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.683
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit. What the fuck?

35:42.767 --> 35:44.560
Hey, hey, take your shirt off,
you bleeding.

35:44.644 --> 35:46.062
- Here, lift your arms.
- Yeah, help him.

35:46.896 --> 35:48.189
Yeah, take that shit off.

35:51.859 --> 35:53.527
Here, hold it. Hold it right here.

35:53.611 --> 35:54.779
Fuck, you okay?

35:55.863 --> 35:57.281
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

35:58.741 --> 36:00.409
You crazy as fuck.

36:00.493 --> 36:02.536
- Hell yeah, nigga.
- What the fuck?

36:02.620 --> 36:04.330
Fucking crazy.

36:04.413 --> 36:06.415
Yo, Sunburn is fucking insane.

36:06.499 --> 36:08.250
Fuck, yeah, fool.

36:08.334 --> 36:09.251
For real, nigga.

36:11.087 --> 36:12.296
What the fuck?

36:12.380 --> 36:13.381
Thanks.

36:14.590 --> 36:15.758
He just fell off of a roof.

36:15.841 --> 36:19.387
Sunburn!

36:19.470 --> 36:20.846
Oh, shit. You bleeding through that one.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.223
Take your shirt off.

36:23.474 --> 36:24.600
Fuck no, it's my favorite shirt.

36:24.934 --> 36:26.769
Nigga, take the fucking shirt off.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.361
You crazy, nigga.

36:35.444 --> 36:36.821
Take that one off.
Take that one off.

36:36.904 --> 36:38.030
Here, put this one on.

36:38.114 --> 36:39.699
Here, take that shit off.

36:40.658 --> 36:41.575
Here, hold that.

36:43.369 --> 36:44.286
Fuck.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.542
Sunburn!

37:20.030 --> 37:22.116
We used to talk all the time.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.661
Now, you just hang out with these...

37:26.912 --> 37:28.414
people I don't even know.

37:30.332 --> 37:32.710
I mean, who are these kids
you're hanging out with?

37:33.711 --> 37:36.213
Are they-- Are they older? Are they...

37:37.381 --> 37:38.841
- from nice families?
- They're my friends.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.593
- I mean, who are they?
- They're my friends!

37:44.054 --> 37:48.934
Fuck. Man. Look at this
crazy-ass nigga right here.

37:49.018 --> 37:51.061
- How's your head, psycho?
- It's fine.

37:51.145 --> 37:53.481
No, Sunburn,
it's definitely not fine.

37:53.564 --> 37:56.108
Got some fucked-up shit going on up there.

37:56.692 --> 37:58.944
Yeah, that boy's looking pretty fucked up.

37:59.028 --> 37:59.945
Yeah.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.619
I think you should probably
ride one of these.

38:07.161 --> 38:09.079
Oh, I don't have any money.

38:10.581 --> 38:12.458
No, you don't understand,
like, this is yours.

38:12.541 --> 38:14.835
No one will be missing it.

38:15.503 --> 38:17.379
Are you fucking serious?

38:17.463 --> 38:19.006
Are you fucking serious?

38:22.092 --> 38:23.552
Hey, come back with some Skittles.

38:24.428 --> 38:25.930
Am I, am I allowed to say thank you?

38:27.014 --> 38:27.848
What?

38:27.932 --> 38:29.016
I mean, I want to.

38:29.934 --> 38:31.602
But I don't want you thinking I'm gay.

38:31.685 --> 38:35.105
Okay, weirdo, saying thank you isn't gay.

38:35.189 --> 38:36.524
It's just common manners.

38:36.607 --> 38:38.818
- Oh. I--
- The fuck?

38:40.319 --> 38:41.570
Thank you so much.

38:41.654 --> 38:43.531
No problem.

40:04.486 --> 40:06.071
Come on, now. You can't--

40:11.327 --> 40:12.578
- Ow!
- Oh, Fuck!

40:12.661 --> 40:13.662
- My bad.
- Yo, what the fuck?

40:14.747 --> 40:16.248
What's up, nigga?

40:16.332 --> 40:17.458
Oh, shit.

40:22.212 --> 40:23.964
- What the fuck?
- You good?

40:28.969 --> 40:30.012
- What's up, nigga?
- What the--

40:35.559 --> 40:37.728
What you trying to do, nigga?
You still standing here.

40:45.736 --> 40:47.780
I think he might've shit himself.

40:47.863 --> 40:50.074
You just gonna stand here,
pussy-ass nigga?

40:50.157 --> 40:52.910
Hey, white boy, you gonna let
this blond bitch talk to you like that?

40:54.161 --> 40:55.162
- Oh! Ooh.
- What?

40:55.245 --> 40:57.665
You're not gonna say shit,
but what you gonna do?

41:36.954 --> 41:38.205
Your friends are fags.

41:40.874 --> 41:42.251
I would've fucked that kid up.

41:44.712 --> 41:45.921
I was just solo.

41:55.222 --> 41:56.640
You think you're pretty cool?

41:59.059 --> 42:00.477
With your ghetto-ass friends.

42:02.521 --> 42:03.981
You think you're tough and shit?

42:11.071 --> 42:12.573
So you fucking smoke now?

42:14.158 --> 42:15.075
Huh?

42:15.576 --> 42:16.577
Don't worry about it.

42:23.751 --> 42:25.335
You know Mom used to smoke, right?

42:27.671 --> 42:30.215
She did a lot of stuff like that
before you were around.

42:33.719 --> 42:37.014
She was a lot different
when I was a little kid...

42:38.265 --> 42:39.516
than when you were a little kid.

42:44.772 --> 42:45.773
What do you mean?

42:48.400 --> 42:49.735
She was very different.

42:50.903 --> 42:53.697
Guys like that,
coming in and out all the time.

42:55.741 --> 42:57.201
A lot of sounds.

43:02.998 --> 43:04.458
What kind of sounds?

43:08.337 --> 43:09.338
Fucking sounds.

43:17.763 --> 43:18.847
Fuck Mom.

43:32.903 --> 43:36.323
My mom and dad are fucking faggots.

43:36.406 --> 43:39.368
Shit, can't wait till I can get a car.

43:39.451 --> 43:42.121
And my shit for sure not getting
taken away like I'm a little bitch.

43:42.204 --> 43:44.039
I'm 'bout to fuck all these bitches.

43:44.123 --> 43:46.250
Hey, shut the fuck up!
You ain't fucking nothing.

43:46.333 --> 43:49.670
Honestly, I'll be surprised if any
of y'all niggas get pussy tonight.

43:51.505 --> 43:52.673
Hey, put y'all hands out.

43:56.385 --> 43:57.553
Ruben.

43:57.636 --> 44:00.055
Hey, why you giving that shit
to these little niggas?

44:00.139 --> 44:02.099
Hey, they big boys.
They can do what they want.

44:02.182 --> 44:03.934
Yeah, I guess you right. Let me see one.

44:06.103 --> 44:07.187
Dumbass.

44:10.023 --> 44:12.192
What is this? Is it dangerous?

44:12.276 --> 44:14.695
Ah, my mom took me to a psychiatrist.

44:14.778 --> 44:17.990
The nigga said I had ADD after an hour.
He gave me these.

44:18.073 --> 44:19.908
Is it, like, bad for you?

44:20.492 --> 44:24.371
Dude, if a fucking doctor gave it to you,
can it possibly be bad for you?

45:03.118 --> 45:04.036
'Sup, baby?

45:04.119 --> 45:07.122
Why are you talking to us?

45:27.809 --> 45:29.770
Hey!

45:34.399 --> 45:36.360
Hey, Sunburn! Sunburn, Sunburn, Sunburn!

45:37.319 --> 45:38.779
Here, that's yours.

45:38.862 --> 45:40.197
You want one, Ray?

45:40.280 --> 45:41.865
You ain't getting one.

46:22.406 --> 46:24.574
Why are you always filming stuff
on that camera?

46:27.369 --> 46:29.037
Someday I wanna make movies.

46:30.372 --> 46:31.540
This one idea.

46:34.710 --> 46:35.836
It's about this baby.

46:37.629 --> 46:40.882
Like a-- Like a su-- Like a super baby.

46:40.966 --> 46:42.426
It's called <i>Strong Baby.</i>

46:44.886 --> 46:45.971
Nice.

46:46.054 --> 46:47.723
- That's cool.
- He has a little cape.

46:48.974 --> 46:50.392
That's a sick idea.

46:52.102 --> 46:53.145
Thanks.

46:58.191 --> 47:00.110
Can I hit that?

47:04.031 --> 47:06.116
How long you been friends
with Ray and those guys?

47:07.868 --> 47:08.869
A couple months.

47:09.745 --> 47:10.746
It's cool.

47:11.830 --> 47:13.832
Fuckshit and Ray are my best friends,
for sure.

47:14.291 --> 47:15.584
They're really cool.

47:17.419 --> 47:19.629
Fourth Grade's cool.
Doesn't talk that much.

47:19.713 --> 47:22.132
He just like... films.

47:23.759 --> 47:24.676
That's cool.

47:27.262 --> 47:29.681
Ruben and I used to be homies, but...

47:30.766 --> 47:31.933
he hates me now, I think.

47:32.601 --> 47:33.518
Why?

47:34.352 --> 47:35.937
Um, I don't know.

47:36.897 --> 47:39.441
I think maybe because
Fuckshit and Ray like me more now.

47:39.900 --> 47:42.861
But Fuckshit and Ray are like really cool.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.113
They're really fucking cool,

47:45.197 --> 47:47.657
but I don't think
they think that I'm that cool.

47:48.241 --> 47:50.702
You're so cute.

47:53.455 --> 47:55.290
Angela likes Fuckshit a lot.

47:55.373 --> 47:57.125
A lot of my friends do.

47:58.502 --> 48:01.379
Do you think he would really date Angela,
or just like, hook up with her

48:01.463 --> 48:05.092
and then not talk to her for a month
until he wants to like, hook up again?

48:06.676 --> 48:07.594
I don't know.

48:09.054 --> 48:10.639
He does that to a lot of girls.

48:14.601 --> 48:17.229
So, you're like, nicer than those guys.

48:17.854 --> 48:21.525
You're like, naturally nice,
not like fake nice.

48:23.568 --> 48:24.486
Thanks.

48:25.320 --> 48:26.238
You're nice, too.

48:28.824 --> 48:31.618
You're like at that age
before guys become dicks.

48:35.705 --> 48:37.624
Those guys are fucking retarded.

48:43.964 --> 48:45.382
Have you ever gotten with a girl?

48:49.010 --> 48:50.011
Yeah.

48:51.388 --> 48:52.597
Are you sure?

48:53.598 --> 48:54.516
Yep.

48:54.891 --> 48:55.809
When?

48:57.435 --> 48:59.479
- Last year.
- Last year?

48:59.563 --> 49:00.981
In-- In Florida.

49:02.190 --> 49:04.276
Oh. Was it-- How was it?

49:06.111 --> 49:07.779
It was all right.

49:08.446 --> 49:09.906
She worked at Disney World.

49:10.532 --> 49:12.659
She just got too comfortable.

49:13.410 --> 49:15.162
Didn't stay in her own lane.

49:15.579 --> 49:16.746
What'd you do?

49:16.830 --> 49:18.290
I don't kiss and tell.

49:20.667 --> 49:21.626
I'm a gentleman.

49:23.420 --> 49:26.339
- That's good to know.
- Mm-hmm.

49:26.423 --> 49:27.799
Not like these fools.

49:29.217 --> 49:30.218
Yeah.

49:35.557 --> 49:37.350
Let's go check out Angela's room.

49:43.857 --> 49:45.275
Ooh.

49:49.613 --> 49:51.823
There you go.

50:18.642 --> 50:19.935
Take my clothes off.

50:23.813 --> 50:25.190
Are you nervous?

50:27.275 --> 50:29.486
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

51:22.831 --> 51:23.832
You okay?

51:32.716 --> 51:34.342
Sorry, I'm just nervous.

51:35.135 --> 51:36.553
It's okay.

51:37.929 --> 51:39.472
Don't be nervous.

52:16.343 --> 52:18.386
Yo! Sunburn!

52:20.555 --> 52:23.641
You gotta tell us what the fuck
happened in there.

52:24.893 --> 52:26.227
Yeah, spill it.

52:26.311 --> 52:28.271
She put two of my fingers in her vagina.

52:30.648 --> 52:31.900
Whoa!

52:31.983 --> 52:34.569
And it's so much lower than I thought.

52:39.783 --> 52:41.534
What else happened?

52:41.910 --> 52:43.536
She was, like, touching my dick.

52:44.704 --> 52:47.457
Whoa! Little man growing up.

52:47.540 --> 52:49.376
She touch your baby wiener?

52:49.459 --> 52:51.252
It was crazy.

52:52.712 --> 52:55.840
- I want that to happen more.
- Oh, shit. Wouldn't we all?

52:57.050 --> 52:58.134
Was he nervous?

52:58.218 --> 52:59.969
- Hell yeah, he was nervous.
- He was shaking?

53:00.053 --> 53:02.013
- He was shaking.
- Give us all the details.

53:02.097 --> 53:03.098
Okay, okay.

53:03.181 --> 53:05.517
He's gonna worship you
for the rest of his fucking life.

53:05.600 --> 53:07.143
He'll never forget you, actually.

53:07.227 --> 53:09.145
Estee, you a freak.

53:09.229 --> 53:12.148
No, look, I heard Fuckshit--
Like, someone was like,

53:12.232 --> 53:16.444
- "Yo, Fuckshit fucks like shit."
- Ew, I bet!

53:16.528 --> 53:18.947
For real though, I want his hair.

53:19.030 --> 53:19.864
- Me too.
- Same.

53:19.948 --> 53:21.616
His hair is so bomb.

53:21.699 --> 53:24.494
Estee is banging.

53:24.577 --> 53:26.746
Props, little nigga.

53:28.039 --> 53:30.667
Hell yeah, props.
You really did that.

53:30.750 --> 53:34.170
You my homie, little homie.

54:23.178 --> 54:26.598
Yo! Stevie! What the fuck are you doing?

54:28.016 --> 54:29.309
You're fucking up!

54:30.101 --> 54:31.269
Stevie!

54:31.352 --> 54:32.770
What the fuck are you doing?

54:33.771 --> 54:35.482
Talk to me! What the fuck are you doing?

54:35.565 --> 54:38.109
You're a pathetic, lonely faggot.

54:38.193 --> 54:39.777
What the fuck did you just say to me?

54:39.861 --> 54:43.531
You have no fucking friends.
You get no fucking pussy!

54:43.615 --> 54:45.783
I'm not fucking taking your shit!

54:53.291 --> 54:54.292
Fuck!

54:58.922 --> 55:00.673
Get the fuck off me--

55:06.012 --> 55:07.764
I'm fucking over this shit!

55:34.332 --> 55:36.000
Mom, stop! Please.

55:36.084 --> 55:38.169
Mom, please. Please.

55:38.253 --> 55:39.921
- We are going in.
- Mom, please, no, please.

55:40.004 --> 55:41.297
Mom, Mom, stop.

55:41.381 --> 55:42.507
Stop, Mom, please.

55:42.590 --> 55:44.008
- Mom, stop.
- Go!

55:44.884 --> 55:47.428
- I was skating all day--
- Hey! What is your name?

55:48.513 --> 55:51.182
- What the fuck?
- What is your name?

55:51.975 --> 55:52.809
Fuckshit.

55:52.892 --> 55:54.561
Fuckshit?

55:55.186 --> 55:56.020
Jesus.

55:56.104 --> 55:58.523
Listen to me.
You do not give my son alcohol.

55:58.606 --> 56:00.024
- Ma'am, ma'am.
- Bitch.

56:00.650 --> 56:01.818
Ma'am, ma'am.

56:01.901 --> 56:03.528
You do not give my son drugs.

56:03.611 --> 56:06.197
- Do you understand me?
- Cool, cool.

56:06.281 --> 56:08.658
That better be cool, Fuckhead
or whatever the fuck your name is!

56:08.741 --> 56:10.743
Stay away from my son.

56:11.119 --> 56:12.036
He's not like you.

56:13.871 --> 56:16.457
- Is she mad about the fingering?
- What fingering?

56:18.251 --> 56:20.920
Say good-bye, Stevie.
This is the last time you're coming here.

56:21.004 --> 56:23.089
Hey, but baby, what's your number, though?

56:23.172 --> 56:24.465
Stevie's mom!

56:24.549 --> 56:25.717
You not taking that down?

56:26.759 --> 56:28.386
You not taking that down?

56:28.469 --> 56:30.430
They look like fucking gang members!

56:30.513 --> 56:32.265
- What you just did to me back there--
- Who are these kids?

56:32.348 --> 56:33.349
I can't fucking trust you!

56:33.433 --> 56:35.018
- I don't fucking owe you.
- Oh, you can't trust me?

56:35.101 --> 56:36.853
- Shut the fuck up!
- Oh, my God.

56:36.936 --> 56:40.857
Hey, shut up!
Shut the fuck up! Shut up! Shut up!

56:40.940 --> 56:43.818
- I just wanna know where you are.
- Shut up!

56:43.901 --> 56:45.320
- Okay?
- Shut the fuck up!

56:45.403 --> 56:47.363
- Listen to me.
- Why are you still talking? Be quiet.

56:47.447 --> 56:50.033
- I just wanna know where--
- Be quiet! Be quiet!

56:50.116 --> 56:51.367
- I just wanna know where you are.
- No!

57:03.504 --> 57:04.505
Yo.

57:07.216 --> 57:08.134
You all right?

57:11.679 --> 57:12.764
You don't look all right.

57:26.277 --> 57:27.945
Your mom is, uh...

57:31.407 --> 57:32.742
very serious.

57:35.703 --> 57:36.704
I just...

57:39.999 --> 57:41.709
I just can't take their shit sometimes.

57:42.794 --> 57:43.795
What kind of shit?

57:46.756 --> 57:47.674
Just shit.

57:51.511 --> 57:53.012
A lot of the time...

57:54.514 --> 57:56.891
we feel like our lives are the worst.

57:59.644 --> 58:00.561
But...

58:04.148 --> 58:06.275
I think if you looked
in anybody else's closet,

58:07.110 --> 58:09.278
you wouldn't trade your shit
for their shit.

58:12.323 --> 58:14.200
Like, look at Fourth Grade.

58:14.617 --> 58:15.827
He is...

58:18.871 --> 58:20.915
one of the poorest people I know.

58:23.042 --> 58:24.836
And I'm not even making a joke, though.

58:26.170 --> 58:30.299
Like, he can barely afford socks.
Seriously.

58:31.926 --> 58:32.927
Socks.

58:34.595 --> 58:35.847
Ruben's mom

58:36.556 --> 58:37.807
gets all fucked up.

58:39.684 --> 58:42.395
She just beats on him and his sister.

58:45.648 --> 58:47.650
Why you think he don't ever wanna go home?

58:49.402 --> 58:51.279
Fuckshit is like my best friend.

58:52.697 --> 58:53.614
And like,

58:54.490 --> 58:56.284
we used to have all these sleepovers

58:56.367 --> 58:59.704
and fucking just dream about

59:00.455 --> 59:03.666
skating and where we wanna take it.

59:06.919 --> 59:07.837
And...

59:10.256 --> 59:12.341
I just feel like he's kinda like...

59:14.677 --> 59:16.262
losing it a little or something.

59:18.139 --> 59:19.807
Now, every day, he just--

59:19.891 --> 59:22.059
He's trying to figure out where to party,

59:22.685 --> 59:25.521
where to get fucked up, drunk.

59:30.860 --> 59:31.778
It's sad.

59:49.420 --> 59:51.047
About like, three years ago...

59:55.134 --> 59:56.052
like,

59:57.136 --> 59:59.889
my little brother
was on the way to soccer practice.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.558
And he was crossing the street...

01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:09.816
and he got hit by a car.

01:00:33.673 --> 01:00:35.883
It's so weird, like--

01:00:37.885 --> 01:00:39.303
We shared a room.

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:43.432
Like...

01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:46.018
a closet.

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:50.523
Whenever I, like, get dressed
in the morning, it's just, like,

01:00:50.606 --> 01:00:52.817
just looking at all the clothes.

01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:56.571
And they just blend into each other and...

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:08.207
It's just weird.

01:01:10.293 --> 01:01:11.210
But...

01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:14.297
after he passed away...

01:01:16.132 --> 01:01:17.800
Fuckshit came to my house...

01:01:19.218 --> 01:01:21.470
and dragged me out to go skate with him.

01:01:26.017 --> 01:01:27.602
Felt good to have somebody there.

01:01:36.027 --> 01:01:37.028
So let's go.

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:45.620
Come on.

01:04:15.102 --> 01:04:16.103
What up?

01:04:22.777 --> 01:04:23.778
What up?

01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:26.655
Fuckshit!

01:05:51.657 --> 01:05:53.117
Hey, Sunburn, let me see that.

01:05:55.244 --> 01:05:56.662
Hey, you good.

01:06:05.045 --> 01:06:05.963
What's up?

01:06:09.175 --> 01:06:12.011
- You ever gone anywhere like that before?
- Oh, no. No, man.

01:06:12.094 --> 01:06:14.346
Where is the craziest place
y'all been on tour?

01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:16.307
- Tampa.
- Is that out somewhere

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:18.267
like Spain or France
or something like that.

01:06:23.272 --> 01:06:24.815
This is fucking crazy.

01:06:26.859 --> 01:06:29.612
It was fucking hilarious.
Friends were like "Oh, shit."

01:06:29.695 --> 01:06:31.071
What's up, Fuckshit?

01:06:31.155 --> 01:06:33.616
You good?

01:06:41.165 --> 01:06:42.208
Nigga!

01:06:43.542 --> 01:06:44.793
What the fuck?

01:06:48.714 --> 01:06:52.134
Oh, it's sick!

01:06:52.468 --> 01:06:53.636
- Yo, hey.
- Hey.

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:57.389
Go chill somewhere else, bruh.
Just for a little bit.

01:07:02.937 --> 01:07:03.938
Okay.

01:07:07.149 --> 01:07:08.400
I'm really sorry about my friend.

01:07:08.484 --> 01:07:11.737
He's cool, but, when he gets drunk,
he's a fucking idiot.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.822
Don't even trip. Fuck it.

01:07:13.906 --> 01:07:16.700
- He didn't need to touch my hair, though.
- Yeah, that was weird as fuck.

01:07:16.784 --> 01:07:18.786
I'm really sorry. Like, um...

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:25.084
But yeah, we, like, just--
We were, like, talking shit.

01:07:29.213 --> 01:07:30.631
Um, I'm really sorry, like--

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:33.467
- Fuck it.
- I'm-- I'm kinda tripping right now.

01:07:35.594 --> 01:07:37.304
Think I should go introduce myself?

01:07:39.306 --> 01:07:40.307
No.

01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:52.945
He's still the man...

01:08:10.337 --> 01:08:11.922
- Watch out.
- What's your problem, man?

01:08:12.006 --> 01:08:13.382
You're my fucking problem.

01:08:13.465 --> 01:08:15.467
- What the fuck is your problem, man?
- You're my fucking problem.

01:08:15.551 --> 01:08:16.593
Don't fucking touch me!

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:19.388
- What the fuck you gonna do, faggot?
- Don't fucking touch me. Don't fucking--

01:08:20.471 --> 01:08:22.558
Don't fucking touch--

01:09:17.363 --> 01:09:18.363
Come on.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:21.742
You good?

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:27.747
Hey, those bitches wanna have a party
at they parents place. Let's roll, nigga.

01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:30.542
Let's roll.

01:09:39.343 --> 01:09:40.594
Get in the car.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:58.862
Let's just get in.

01:10:05.494 --> 01:10:07.996
A'ight, Stevie rides shotgun.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.375
You're the little G.
Now you gonna pussy-wipe me, nigga?

01:10:31.562 --> 01:10:34.273
Yo, Fuckshit.
Just take everybody home.

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:37.860
No, we're going
to this fucking party. Just fucking chill.

01:10:38.527 --> 01:10:41.780
Fuck that shit. Let's just call it.
Everybody in here is bummed.

01:10:41.864 --> 01:10:44.074
I'm not about to let you
fuck up my fun, nigga.

01:10:44.158 --> 01:10:46.076
You don't have any type of fun no more.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.537
Nobody in this fucking car is having fun,
if you haven't noticed.

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:51.206
Only fun you have
is sucking them pros' dicks.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:54.126
Stop tryin' to kill my fun.
You used to be fun as hell--

01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:58.172
Ah, that's some fucking shit.

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:09.475
Could you, like, pull ov--

01:11:18.901 --> 01:11:19.818
Fuck!

01:11:19.902 --> 01:11:21.487
Why the fuck
did we get in the car with you?

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:22.488
Help!

01:11:23.697 --> 01:11:25.866
There's fucking blood. What the fuck?

01:11:28.327 --> 01:11:30.579
Stevie?

01:11:31.497 --> 01:11:33.749
Fuck! Help!

01:11:33.832 --> 01:11:35.250
- Stevie!
- Stevie?

01:11:35.334 --> 01:11:37.377
Stevie!

01:11:37.461 --> 01:11:39.421
- Sunburn!
- What the fuck did you do?

01:11:39.505 --> 01:11:41.757
Help!

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.758
Sunburn!

01:12:50.117 --> 01:12:51.034
Yeah.

01:15:41.163 --> 01:15:42.205
Do you wanna go see him?

01:16:02.476 --> 01:16:03.393
Can I see it?

01:16:05.812 --> 01:16:07.022
They took a picture.

01:16:12.819 --> 01:16:14.821
Fuck. Shit.

01:16:15.906 --> 01:16:18.074
Nigga, what the fuck?

01:16:19.993 --> 01:16:20.911
That's fucked up.

01:16:28.168 --> 01:16:29.169
Are you okay?

01:16:34.758 --> 01:16:38.428
You literally take the hardest hits
outta anybody I ever seen in my life.

01:16:45.185 --> 01:16:46.603
You know you don't have to do that, right?

01:17:04.788 --> 01:17:06.289
You guys wanna see something?

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:19.195
<i>Five-O!</i>

01:19:12.165 --> 01:19:13.583
- Fourth Grade.
- Fourth Grade, yeah.

01:19:13.667 --> 01:19:16.544
Fourth Grade!
