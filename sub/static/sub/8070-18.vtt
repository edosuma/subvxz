You may ask, why do 100
enemies with 100 swords

00:14.882 --> 00:19.220
pursue one poor poet?

00:19.320 --> 00:26.527
Because they know this poet is
a friend of Cyrano de Bergerac.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.214
So it's not exactly
like "Pinocchio."

00:46.314 --> 00:48.916
You should have caught on,
DJ, when she said "The Elephant

00:49.016 --> 00:51.985

What, is Aunt Jackie on?

01:00.861 --> 01:03.164
Roseanne, i got to go.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.332
No, Dan.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.699
This is Jackie's big night.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.601
We got to sit here
and watch the play,

01:07.701 --> 01:09.837
and then go backstage and
tell her it didn't stink.

01:09.937 --> 01:10.738
I'm sick.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.206
I get the flu.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.750
I need to be sick
in my own bathroom.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.818
Well, Jackie's
part's coming up now.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.254
And she went to a lot
of time and trouble

01:26.354 --> 01:28.322
to make sure her
character was special.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.957
We'll just watch her
part, and then we'll go.

Nothing.

That's an interesting
career choice.

theater, Roseanne.

actors help out?

He saw your play
last night, and he

07:59.279 --> 08:00.447
wants to fly you
out to Hollywood

08:00.548 --> 08:01.549
so you can answer his phone.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.850
That's funny,
you're very-- ah.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.885

Yep.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.634
OK.

08:20.734 --> 08:21.869
Sure.

08:21.969 --> 08:22.803

I have to go on tonight.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.983
I have to do Roxanne.

to do tureen of beef?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.457
I'm in trouble, Roseanne.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.993
I didn't think she
was going to get sick.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.127
She never misses a show.

08:47.227 --> 08:51.531
I didn't really bother
to learn the whole part.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.766
What?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.034
Well, I mean, I
know a little bit.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.168
I know what happens.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.103
Kind of.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.240
I don't believe you, Jackie.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.375
You better call the guy up and
tell him that you can't do it.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.376
I can't do that.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.277
I'm the understudy.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.647
I'm their last resort.

09:06.747 --> 09:07.748
Well, what are
you going to do?

09:07.848 --> 09:08.649
I don't know.

09:11.885 --> 09:12.920
I should go buy the play.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.792
[upbeat music]

09:22.796 --> 09:26.133
OK, so that what's his name
Cyrano, he goes, "Call her."

09:26.233 --> 09:28.468
And then that Christian,
he goes, "Roxanne."

09:28.568 --> 09:29.770
and then you go--
- I know this.

09:29.870 --> 09:30.738
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.

09:30.838 --> 09:31.639
Don't tell me.

09:33.774 --> 09:34.574
OK, tell me.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.748
You guys have been rehearsing
this play for a whole month.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.149
Have you ever even watched it?

09:42.249 --> 09:43.383
I wasn't in this scene.

09:43.483 --> 09:46.820
I didn't care what happened
in the rest of the play.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.289
Roseanne, I got
bad things coming

09:49.389 --> 09:50.457
out of every part of my body.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.264
Oh, you poor baby.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.866
Is there anything
I can do to make

09:58.966 --> 10:03.403
you feel better without
actually having to touch you?

10:03.503 --> 10:05.839
I need some post-nasal
drip medicine.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.540
Oh, we don't have
any of that, Dan.

10:07.641 --> 10:08.608
I'm dripping.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.877
Dan!

10:09.977 --> 10:11.812
I'm working on a scene here.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.313
Can you give me a minute?

10:13.413 --> 10:15.582
No!

10:15.683 --> 10:17.450
I swear, the very next
one of yous to whine

10:17.550 --> 10:20.453
is going to get creamed.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.355
Dan, please help her
out with her lines.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.256
Aw!

10:23.356 --> 10:24.357
I'll make you some tea.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.759
[coughing]

10:25.859 --> 10:28.595
All right, where were you?

10:28.696 --> 10:29.596
Where?

10:29.697 --> 10:31.298
Christian goes,
"It's Christian."

10:31.398 --> 10:34.167
DAN: It's Christian.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.568
And if it is, so?

10:35.669 --> 10:37.070
My dearest Roxanne--

10:37.170 --> 10:39.539
[coughing]

10:39.639 --> 10:40.708
What--

10:40.808 --> 10:42.776
I'm never going
to learn this scene.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.212
I'm going to be humiliated
in front of the whole town.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.446
[coughing]

10:46.546 --> 10:48.682
Jackie, you've learned
the whole rest of the play,

10:48.782 --> 10:49.983
you know.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.052
Why are you having so much
trouble with this one scene?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.053
It's too much pressure!

10:53.153 --> 10:54.755
Everything happens
in this one scene!

10:54.855 --> 10:55.889
There's too much going on.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.190
First Christian's talking.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.892
And then Cyrano's
talking to Christian.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.128
And then Christian is
pretending to be Cyrano--

11:01.228 --> 11:02.195
Oh, never mind about me.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.096
I'll be fine.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.735
I'm ready.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.636
Oh no, your Scout thing.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.004
I forgot.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.473
OK, go on out in the car.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.108
I'll get dressed, and
I'll meet you out there.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.078
Hurry up.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.579
You can't go out, Dan.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.715
Roseanne, there's no way
I'm going to miss this.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.615
He's my son.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.217
I've got to be there.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.118
I'll take him.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.387
OK.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.421
What?

11:28.521 --> 11:29.823
No!
Wait a minute!

11:29.923 --> 11:30.991
No, you can't go.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.225
This play starts in two hours.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.360
Well--

11:33.460 --> 11:35.095
I need your help, or
I'm just going to flop.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.897
Jackie, DJ made
some wood thing,

11:36.997 --> 11:38.065
and they're giving him a medal.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.933
But I was counting on you.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.169
Well, get somebody else
in the play to help you.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.336
I can't do that.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.606
Then they'll know I
didn't memorize the lines.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.607
[sighs]

11:47.707 --> 11:48.508
Bye.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.643
I can't believe this!

11:50.744 --> 11:53.646
You're dumping me for
some stupid merit badge?

11:53.747 --> 11:56.049
That stupid merit badge
is the most important thing

11:56.149 --> 11:57.284
in my son's life right now.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.685
Well, this is the most
important thing in my life.

11:58.786 --> 12:01.054
If you are any kind of sister,
you wouldn't run out on me now.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.455
Yeah, well if I was
any kind of sister,

12:02.555 --> 12:04.657
I already would have told you
that this whole theater thing

12:04.758 --> 12:06.593
is getting way out of hand.

12:06.693 --> 12:07.995
What's that supposed to mean?

12:08.095 --> 12:10.097
Well, that everybody else
just has it as a hobby,

12:10.197 --> 12:11.965
but you're turning it
into a career, you know,

12:12.065 --> 12:14.601
just because you've got
nothing else going on.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.203
Oh, that's what you think.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.604
Ever since you
quite the force,

12:17.704 --> 12:19.239
you've just been
hanging out, Jackie.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.074
Oh sure, you're not
hanging out at the Lobo.

12:21.174 --> 12:24.144
Now it's a theater, but
it's still just hanging out.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.745
OK, fine.
Sure.

12:25.846 --> 12:26.814
Bye-bye.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.448
Thanks for being there
for me, Roseanne.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.018
[coughing]

12:31.118 --> 12:32.953
Shut up, Dan.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.421
[upbeat music]

12:37.891 --> 12:40.227
[gentle music]

12:45.665 --> 12:48.468
You've scrambled the
eggs too hard, Becky.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.938
A minute ago he said
they were too loose.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.105
Yeah, well now
they're too chewy,

12:52.205 --> 12:53.340
and they make his
little face hurt.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.109
[plate clatters]
- Well hey, that's it.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.644
I'm not cooking for him anymore.

12:57.744 --> 13:02.449
If he wants to eat, he can
lick the VapoRub off his chest.

13:02.549 --> 13:06.353
Hey girls, your
brother's a chipmunk.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.554
Woodchuck.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.455
Whatever.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.092
Where's you dad?

13:12.192 --> 13:13.093
How's he doing?

13:13.193 --> 13:15.863
He's driving us crazy.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.764
Does my tongue
look funny to you?

13:17.865 --> 13:18.665
Ew, gross!

13:25.873 --> 13:26.706
Well, well.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.607
It lives.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.076
Yeah, I feel a little better.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.947
So how come you're
driving that girls crazy?

13:34.047 --> 13:35.983
Kicks.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.317
Did Jackie call?
DAN: No.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.218
Jeez.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.120
She's a big girl.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.121
I know.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.522
You know, I was
thinking-- of course,

13:42.622 --> 13:44.424
what I said to her
was true, you know,

13:44.524 --> 13:48.628
but maybe I was a
tad insensitive.

13:48.728 --> 13:49.529
How unlike you.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.635
Maybe I ought to just back off
and let her live her own life.

13:55.735 --> 13:58.071
[laughing]

13:58.171 --> 14:01.942
[upbeat music]

14:02.042 --> 14:05.345
[theatrical music]

14:09.349 --> 14:10.217
Christian!

14:10.317 --> 14:11.551
Cyrano!

14:11.651 --> 14:13.553
And what is this urgency?

14:13.653 --> 14:15.222
She read the letters.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.789
She wants to see me.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.291
Ah, that is good.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.493
But she thinks
they are my words.

14:20.593 --> 14:21.428
Is that not what you want?

14:21.528 --> 14:22.862
(WHISPERING) Is
someone calling?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.064
Is someone calling?

14:24.164 --> 14:25.532
Is someone calling?

14:25.632 --> 14:27.267
Is someone calling?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.036
Relax, you're doing great.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.470
You think so, Lou?

14:30.570 --> 14:31.939
Well, you're no Shirley Fisk.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.541
Yeah, well, who is?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.876
Not you.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.579
Come, stand
beneath the balcony,

14:39.679 --> 14:42.382
whilst I stand behind the tree
and whisper the words for you

14:42.482 --> 14:44.351
to woo her.
Call her forth.

14:47.187 --> 14:47.988
Roxanne.

14:56.796 --> 14:57.597
Roxanne!

15:05.072 --> 15:07.474
Call her forth louder.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.375
Roxanne!

15:11.778 --> 15:13.246
Is someone calling?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.382
Is someone calling?
CHRISTIAN: Roxanne!

15:15.482 --> 15:17.184
- Jackie.
- Is some

15:17.284 --> 15:18.685
Someone's calling.

15:18.785 --> 15:19.719
Oh god, Lou.

15:19.819 --> 15:20.620
OK.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.554
Yeah.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.690
OK.

15:23.790 --> 15:27.727
Mayhaps we are at
the wrong balcony.

15:27.827 --> 15:28.628
I don't think so.

15:32.799 --> 15:36.703
So, are you from
France originally?

15:41.108 --> 15:43.943
Is someone calling?

15:44.044 --> 15:44.978
What shall I say?

15:45.078 --> 15:47.847
Heed what I say and repeat it.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.250
My words before
could not express--

15:50.350 --> 15:53.120
My words before
could not express--

15:53.220 --> 15:54.754
--what my heart truly feels.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.923
--what my heart truly feels.

15:57.024 --> 15:57.824
Oh.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.695
ROSEANNE: (WHISPERING) I can
see that you love me no longer.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.369
My father, the
duke, is calling.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.539
Be right back.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.007
What are you doing here?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.109
I can see that you
love me no longer.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.444
We had an argument.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.545
We'll work it out.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.479
I'm in a play!

16:23.416 --> 16:25.552
That is the line, Jackie.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.786
Oh, no.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.755
It's no use, Roseanne.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.957
No, you go on out there,
and I'll feed you your lines.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.192
No, we can't do that.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.093
Why not?

16:33.193 --> 16:33.993
They're doing it.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.134
Oh, the Big Dipper.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.576
I can see that you
love me no longer.

16:49.676 --> 16:50.543
Oh you gods!

16:50.643 --> 16:51.644
Oh you gods!

16:51.744 --> 16:52.979
See how I love--

16:53.080 --> 16:54.647
See how I love--

16:54.747 --> 16:56.015
more than words can say!

16:56.116 --> 16:59.652
more than words can say!

16:59.752 --> 17:00.720
ROSEANNE: Why are you words--

17:00.820 --> 17:02.289
Why are your words--
ROSEANNE: so--

17:02.389 --> 17:03.790
so--
ROSEANNE: halting

17:03.890 --> 17:04.691
halting.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.761
How shall I explain?

17:08.861 --> 17:09.729
I shall speak for you.

17:09.829 --> 17:10.597
Good.

17:13.733 --> 17:18.138
Each word struggles through
the dark, seeking your light.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.106
ROSEANNE: If that were true--

17:19.206 --> 17:20.773
If that were true.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.008
ROSEANNE: my own words--

17:22.109 --> 17:22.975
my own words--

17:23.076 --> 17:24.211
ROSEANNE: would
struggle like yours.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.845
would struggle like yours.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.847
It seems to me that
your words come more

17:27.947 --> 17:29.516
easily than they did before.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.417
ROSEANNE: That's right!

17:30.517 --> 17:31.318
I know!

17:34.554 --> 17:36.989
But I have never spoken
with my true heart, before.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.225
Why not?

17:38.325 --> 17:41.828
Because I have never
spoken to your heart before.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.029
I love you.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.030
Christian!

17:44.131 --> 17:46.499
Oh, you do
tremble like a leaf.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.567
Yes, I tremble.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.735
I tremble with love.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.503
For you have made me love you.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.939
That's right!

17:53.039 --> 17:54.874
Give me a kiss.

17:54.974 --> 17:58.578
Now I could die, but
for one thing, a kiss!

17:58.678 --> 18:00.813
Come then, it awaits you!

18:00.913 --> 18:01.848
Go Go!

18:01.948 --> 18:03.283
Climb!

18:03.383 --> 18:05.718
JACKIE: A kiss, sweet as nectar.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.155
Come claim your prize.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.055
Roxanne!

18:14.694 --> 18:17.664
Hey Lou, is that guy single?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.967
[theatrical music]

18:23.436 --> 18:25.938
Excuse me, Roseanne,
I need the table.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.707
Oh, sorry.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.009
Hey, Jackie was that
tonight, wasn't she?

18:30.109 --> 18:32.579
Yeah well, the important
thing is, she fit the costume.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.984
Hey Phil, good job tonight.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.686
Hey, thanks Roseanne.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.188
Jackie did good,
don't you think?

18:41.288 --> 18:43.190
Well, I got to tell you, I've
been doing community theater

18:43.290 --> 18:46.859
for 14 years now and, no.

18:50.397 --> 18:51.898
Well, she remembered
most of her lines.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.200
Yeah, that she did.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.234
I'll see you.
- OK.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.202
Have a nice night.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.303
I said no, Al.

18:56.403 --> 18:57.270
Come on.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.471
Are you going to
stand there and tell

18:58.571 --> 19:00.207
me you didn't feel
something special

19:00.307 --> 19:02.609
going on between us tonight?

19:02.709 --> 19:04.611
I was playing a part.

19:04.711 --> 19:05.878
I was acting.

19:05.978 --> 19:10.049
Come on, you're not
that good of an actor.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.918
Good night, Al.

19:12.018 --> 19:12.819
Good night, Roxanne.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.690
[laughing]

19:17.790 --> 19:20.627
What a doof.

19:20.727 --> 19:21.728
Jackie, you were great.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.629
JACKIE: No, I wasn't.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.896
Oh yes you were!

19:23.996 --> 19:25.064
No.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.133
Everybody was leaving
during my curtain call.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.536
Well, sure, because
it's snowing outside,

19:29.636 --> 19:32.138
you know, and they
want to get home.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.039
Shirley got roses.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.173
I didn't get roses.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.675
Well, that was opening night.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.310
You only get roses
on opening night.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.279
You're just saying
that, Roseanne.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.980
You're just trying not
to make me feel bad.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.283
Oh Jackie, have
some confidence, OK?

19:43.383 --> 19:44.183
God, you're pathetic.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.356
You know, you
were right, before.

19:49.456 --> 19:52.259
I haven't done anything,
really, since I quit the force.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.060
Well you've got the
right to take your time

19:54.160 --> 19:56.363
and figure out what it
is you really want to do.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.564
I've had plenty of time.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.931
I know.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.000
It's just that I was really
proud of being a cop, you know,

20:01.100 --> 20:01.901
so--

20:02.001 --> 20:02.835
I know that.

20:02.935 --> 20:03.970
I don't want to
do just anything.

20:04.070 --> 20:06.406
Well, you'll find
something, Jackie, trust me.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.874
You've got a lot of potential.
- Yeah.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.175
You're going to
find the right thing.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.444
You'll see.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.112
So you really thought
I was good, huh?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.448
I-- I couldn't believe it.
I thought you were great.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.449
Yeah, I don't know.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.485
Maybe Roxanne isn't my part.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.419
I don't know.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.688
She, uh, dumps the
really cool guy

20:21.788 --> 20:23.956
with the big nose for the
moron with the cute butt.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.057
That's right up your alley.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.899
I must find a way
to make her love me!

20:32.999 --> 20:34.000
Now!

20:34.100 --> 20:36.569
And how am I to teach--

20:36.669 --> 20:38.004
how am I to--

20:38.104 --> 20:40.407
how am I to--

20:40.507 --> 20:41.408
[sneezing]

20:41.508 --> 20:42.309
Bless you.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.983
And how am I to teach you now?

20:54.487 --> 20:55.755
What?

20:55.855 --> 20:56.623
Nose.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.625
Nose.

20:58.725 --> 21:02.128
Oh god.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.129
I shall die!

21:03.229 --> 21:04.631
Oh, yes.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.933
Stand here beneath our balcony
whilst I stand behind the tree

21:07.033 --> 21:09.869
and whisper the words
for you to woo her.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.838
[sneezing]

21:14.006 --> 21:14.807
Roxanne!

21:18.311 --> 21:19.579
Is someone call--

21:19.679 --> 21:22.515
[sneezing]

21:31.458 --> 21:32.659
Is someone call--

21:32.759 --> 21:36.028
[sneezing]

21:38.998 --> 21:40.567
A token of her love.

21:45.171 --> 21:46.873
[sneezing]

21:52.679 --> 21:53.179
