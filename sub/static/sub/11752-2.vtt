'Dear Maurice, we regret to inform you

00:18.800 --> 00:22.110
'that we have decided to terminate
your contract on Grubbs.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.550
'After careful deliberation,
numerous second chances

00:25.600 --> 00:27.390
'and multiple missed deadlines,

00:27.440 --> 00:30.350
'we feel cessation of
our working relationship

00:30.400 --> 00:32.830
'is best for all concerned.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.470
'We wish you the best
of luck for the future.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.830
'Yours sincerely, Carol...

00:37.880 --> 00:41.880
'And Carroll.'

00:49.520 --> 00:52.790
Excuse me... is this the psychiatry wing?

00:52.840 --> 00:55.430
Yes, yes, it is, yes. How can I help?

00:55.480 --> 00:59.480
Um... I'm... having some trouble

01:00.240 --> 01:04.239
with, er... I think... maybe...

01:04.720 --> 01:07.320
It's OK. Well done for coming in.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.670
- Come on.
- Oh, thank you.

01:10.720 --> 01:14.350
Yeah... um...

01:14.400 --> 01:16.590
So, well, I...

01:16.640 --> 01:20.640
I think I just need some help.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.230
Well, you've come to the right place,

01:23.280 --> 01:25.710
but unfortunately, I'm not a doctor.

01:25.760 --> 01:27.350
Oh. Sorry.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.400
No. I just dress like
a doctor, cos I'm mad.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.190
Right. Um...

01:34.240 --> 01:35.790
Is there any doctors here?

01:35.840 --> 01:39.230
Yeah, there's doctors everywhere.

01:39.280 --> 01:40.390
It's a hospital.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.870
Yeah, of course, yeah.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.630
Thank you.

01:54.760 --> 01:58.760
- Tea.
- Thanks.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.120
Just going to ask, um... if
I could borrow that jacket

02:05.520 --> 02:07.310
that you used to wear?

02:07.360 --> 02:10.310
The one that you said was a big mistake.

02:10.360 --> 02:14.360
Sure.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.880
- You all right.
- Fine. Just resting.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.950
You look... quite bad.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
I think it just might be
that it's quite dark in here.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.600
You told Mum yet?

02:34.400 --> 02:37.670
Do you think that maybe you
should just... go to the doctor

02:37.720 --> 02:40.110
or something?

02:40.160 --> 02:44.160
Uh... no, I think I just need
to sit down for a bit more.

02:48.280 --> 02:52.280
Don't worry about me.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.840
OK.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.910
So, we finished our brunch,

03:08.960 --> 03:12.950
then we just started going
for it in the back of a car,

03:13.000 --> 03:14.910
and it was so passionate.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.950
It was like we'd gone
back in a time machine.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.740
Hugo? Can you get ready, now, please?

03:21.600 --> 03:23.710
So, anyway, now Steve is back at home

03:23.760 --> 03:25.950
and Hugo is really happy.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.070
Just watching you all support each other

03:28.120 --> 03:31.590
after all the terrible things
that you've had to deal with,

03:31.640 --> 03:34.590
it really helped put everything
into perspective for us.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.510
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I just... slept badly.

03:37.560 --> 03:41.560
So, well, that's why we wanted to
take you out to dinner, basically...

03:42.280 --> 03:46.280
to say thank you for being
such an inspiration to us.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.950
It only lasted about
two-and-a-half minutes

03:50.000 --> 03:52.070
and I'm pretty sure she
didn't achieve climax.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.910
I don't need to know
the details, thank you.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.910
Just because I'm in love with your wife,

03:55.960 --> 03:58.790
it doesn't mean I can leap into
your bed with her on a Friday night.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.840
Please... anything I can do to make
it up to you, just let me know.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.270
I could build you a bigger,
better writing shed.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.630
That won't be necessary.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.790
All right, then.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.150
Punch me.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.910
It's only fair. Go on.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.960
Punch me in the face, as many times
as you like, as hard as you can.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.589
Please... just once.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.709
Covered in Satan's piss!

04:19.760 --> 04:23.760
Look, I... I really, really
want to make it up to you.

04:24.080 --> 04:28.080
Maurice, I'm begging you.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.510
Morning! Have you seen Barry anywhere?

04:32.560 --> 04:34.350
He's in the cabin with your husband.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.990
Said he needed to have a chat
with him about something.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.470
Oh. What about?

04:38.520 --> 04:41.430
Oh, he said that he'd done something
awful and that he deserved to die.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.710
Oh! Sounds very melodramatic.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.510
I'm sorry, Deborah. I
couldn't keep it a secret.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.430
I had to tell him the whole truth.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.390
I refuse to take payment for a year.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.070
I think you should just hit me
over the head with that shovel.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.270
Ryan, give her the shovel.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.790
- Blabbermouth.
- What's happened?

04:56.840 --> 04:59.510
We committed the act of heavenly darkness.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.950
We lay in sin.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.910
Um... OK.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.790
Dad?

05:10.840 --> 05:14.840
Dad!

05:29.600 --> 05:33.600
Oi! Joan of Arc...

05:34.480 --> 05:37.710
What the hell?

05:37.760 --> 05:40.750
- Did Dad lend you that jacket?
- Mm-hm.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.470
Unfair!

05:47.080 --> 05:49.430
There's something wrong with Dad.

05:49.480 --> 05:53.480
I think he's got cancer.

05:57.560 --> 05:58.870
Hi, Maurice.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.150
This fucking hat...

06:02.200 --> 06:05.030
Ludicrous.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.990
Did you perhaps have a chat
with Barry this morning?

06:08.040 --> 06:09.590
Maybe we should talk about that,

06:09.640 --> 06:11.830
instead of playing with
your father's magic stuff.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.950
Can't you see that I've
got more important things

06:14.000 --> 06:15.550
on my mind right now?

06:15.600 --> 06:17.230
Like what?

06:17.280 --> 06:21.270
Like the fact that the Carrolls have
just dropped Grubbs, for instance.

06:21.320 --> 06:25.320
And there's all this
stupid crap to sort through.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.550
I hate magic. I hate it.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.430
Well, Barbara has invited us out
for dinner, to say thank you,

06:34.480 --> 06:36.070
for being an inspiration to them,

06:36.120 --> 06:39.230
so... well, we've got that
to look forward to, at least.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.670
Well, I don't want to go.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.070
Great.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.110
Well, I've told them that
we are, so you have to.

06:44.160 --> 06:48.160
That's very democratic, isn't it?

06:55.160 --> 06:59.160
How are my two lovely children?

06:59.240 --> 07:03.150
What are you both up to?

07:03.200 --> 07:05.070
Oh, you've got make-up on.

07:05.120 --> 07:09.120
Oh, it's very nice.

07:11.960 --> 07:15.110
Excuse me. Mr Flowers.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.430
Fuck off, Shun.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.310
I have idea, Mr Flowers.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.630
Very big shame Grubbs is cancel,

07:20.680 --> 07:23.910
but Carol and Carroll very
positive, some of my projects.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.830
Please... this is very
simple traditional comic.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.880
I think definitely success.

07:32.240 --> 07:36.240
So, I've just spoken to your
father, and we've got some bad news.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.230
- They've dropped Grubbs.
- What? - Is that why he's being so weird?

07:40.280 --> 07:42.830
Probably. I can't think
what else it would be?

07:42.880 --> 07:44.710
- Have you asked him?
- Hm?

07:44.760 --> 07:47.870
Have you asked him if
anything else is going on?

07:47.920 --> 07:51.430
Course I have. Why? Has
he said something to you?

07:51.480 --> 07:53.630
So he has? Great secret-keeping.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.510
Amy, what's he said?

07:55.560 --> 07:57.750
Amy, we have to talk about
this. It's very important.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.800
- Where are you going?
- It doesn't matter.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.430
Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee...

08:04.480 --> 08:07.590
Super Flowers! Protect world
from dangerous monster!

08:07.640 --> 08:09.710
You write story, I draw picture.

08:09.760 --> 08:10.870
Is this a joke?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.270
We are team, Mr Flowers.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.430
No. We're not a team, Shun.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.510
You're just a person we
hire to do the pictures.

08:15.560 --> 08:19.510
No wonder I haven't been able to focus, when
you're constantly farting about on other things,

08:19.560 --> 08:21.190
most of which is basically porn.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.550
- It's unbelievably distracting.
- You unbelievably...

08:23.600 --> 08:26.350
Then I discover you're buttering
up the Carrolls behind my back

08:26.400 --> 08:29.550
with these ridiculous
cartoons of me and my family.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.150
I gave you a job. I've given
you a house, for heaven's sake.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.909
Not house, Mr Flowers... tiny office,
very uncomfortable for sleeping.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.110
You are always snore very
loud, like big dinosaur.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.350
Well, why don't you draw a
picture of me as a dinosaur,

08:40.400 --> 08:42.510
with a ten-foot penis and
some breasts on my head?

08:42.559 --> 08:44.510
Why you not tell truth, Mr Flowers?

08:44.560 --> 08:45.550
You are stupid idiot,

08:45.600 --> 08:47.630
everything complete muddle, all you fault.

08:47.680 --> 08:51.590
I've been trying, Shun.
It's just not very easy.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.640
You are not easy.

09:49.680 --> 09:53.680
Arrrggghhh!

09:54.400 --> 09:58.310
(Donald?)

09:58.360 --> 10:02.110
What's matter, Donald?

10:02.160 --> 10:05.070
Donald, what's matter?

10:05.120 --> 10:08.870
The cogs of my heart are all asunder.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.920
Cogs of my heart all asunder...

10:13.440 --> 10:16.750
Cogs of my...

10:16.800 --> 10:18.070
Girl trouble?

10:18.120 --> 10:20.750
Yeah.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.200
Donald...

10:24.200 --> 10:28.200
Donald, I have a very good
advice for you, Donald.

10:29.520 --> 10:33.520
Will make girl very happy.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.600
Just give little tickle...
little, tiny tickle all over,

10:40.160 --> 10:44.160
make girl very happy, Donald.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.230
That's the weirdest
advice I've ever heard.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.030
What's wrong with you?

10:49.080 --> 10:53.080
You've not even got a book to work
on, now... why don't you just leave?

10:53.360 --> 10:55.510
I have plan, Donald.
Everything will be happy.

10:55.560 --> 10:56.830
No-one likes you.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.030
We are friends, Donald.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.430
We're not friends.

11:07.120 --> 11:10.110
- Maurice!
- I'm getting ready.

11:10.160 --> 11:14.160
Why is Shun in the fucking car?

11:15.080 --> 11:17.790
- Get out, Shun.
- Good evening, Mrs Flowers. I will drive.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.910
No, thank you, get out.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.830
You must have a relax this
evening, have a drink, Mrs Flowers.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.230
- Get out!
- I will...

11:23.280 --> 11:25.430
OK, one second, for the seatbelt.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.230
Oh, my gosh...!

11:27.280 --> 11:30.230
Let go of the seatbelt!

11:30.280 --> 11:33.430
Mrs Flowers, if you can have a
conversation with your husband,

11:33.480 --> 11:34.710
I think will be very big help.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.990
Maybe have a little snifter, good mood...

11:37.040 --> 11:38.190
Oh, it's my fault, is it?

11:38.240 --> 11:39.910
I think if you are welcome him,

11:39.960 --> 11:41.790
maybe conversation will be more simple.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.950
Sometimes, maybe your manner is
little bit terrify Mr Flowers...

11:45.000 --> 11:47.670
Oh, you've got some
nerve, mister, some nerve.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.150
- Something need to happen.
- I tell you what needs to happen...

11:50.200 --> 11:52.030
you need to butt the hell out.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.710
Very confused, Mrs Flowers.

11:53.760 --> 11:57.760
So am I, Shun. So am I.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.590
Can I get you anything to drink?

12:02.640 --> 12:06.640
Uh... oh, I'll just have a
pina colada or something.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.510
- Pina colada?
- Yeah, no. Um...

12:10.560 --> 12:11.990
Can I just have a burger, then?

12:12.040 --> 12:14.590
I'll have a pina colada.

12:14.640 --> 12:18.470
Oh, yeah. Me too, then.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.990
- And a burger.
- Yeah, and a burger. And loads of condiments.

12:22.040 --> 12:26.040
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.270
Maurice?

12:37.320 --> 12:38.950
Sorry, we're a little bit late.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.950
I just thought I'd come and say hello.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.230
Hello.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.830
Steve, Hugo's dad.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.950
- Oh.
- Sorry. - Right.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.390
- Oh... couldn't pinch one of them, could I?
- Sure.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.230
Cheers, nice one.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.950
Yeah.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.590
It's nice to meet you, finally.
I've heard so much about you,

12:58.640 --> 13:01.510
through Barbara... and Hugo.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.670
He thinks you're great.

13:03.720 --> 13:04.910
Yeah, he...

13:04.960 --> 13:06.870
Well, he loves Grubbs.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.150
I used to read it to him
before bed, sometimes. I...

13:10.200 --> 13:13.030
In a weird kind of a way, I kind
of feel like I know you already.

13:13.080 --> 13:16.750
Hm.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.390
You don't.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.030
- No.
- You don't know me.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.110
Yeah. No.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.190
What?

13:27.240 --> 13:31.240
No, nothing, just...

13:35.440 --> 13:39.250
Yeah. Thank you. Very nice. Thank you.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.590
You're hungry.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.880
So, who's Penny, anyway?

14:25.280 --> 14:28.510
That thing that you
wrote, Penny's Passage,

14:28.560 --> 14:31.190
is that an ex or something?

14:31.240 --> 14:35.240
Mm... No. Penny died in
the early sixth century.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.070
- You not heard of her?
- No.

14:40.120 --> 14:44.120
No, I haven't.

14:46.240 --> 14:50.190
So, there was this pagan
ceremony called The Passage,

14:50.240 --> 14:53.670
where if you wanted to marry a
man from the neighbouring village,

14:53.720 --> 14:55.030
they'd cut your hand,

14:55.080 --> 14:58.110
so you could mingle your blood
with the earth of your home.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.870
And then they'd gift you a horse

14:59.920 --> 15:02.670
and you'd ride it over this sacred bridge

15:02.720 --> 15:05.830
and across the holy
lake out of the forest.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.710
And that was how they sent
you on to your new life.

15:08.760 --> 15:12.350
And you were allowed to have sex
and have children and everything.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.750
- I think I ran over that bridge!
- Yeah!

15:14.800 --> 15:18.430
So, because Penelope had
Asperger's or something,

15:18.480 --> 15:21.350
- she wasn't allowed to do The Passage.
- Shit!

15:21.400 --> 15:24.270
Even though she was in love
with this blind boy called Barney

15:24.320 --> 15:27.710
- from a village about four
miles away. - Barney? - Yeah.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.760
So anyway, this one night,
there was a giant storm.

15:32.600 --> 15:36.110
And Penny sneaked out to this pen
where they kept these horses.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.310
And basically, the horses
were a bit freaked out by her

15:39.360 --> 15:41.230
but there was this one horse,

15:41.280 --> 15:43.790
it just seemed to quite like Penny.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.630
So she sneaked it out of the pen,

15:45.680 --> 15:49.230
and started riding it around
the forest through the rain.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.550
Like, basically doing The Passage.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.600
She got so excited, she let out
this strange biblical howl.

15:57.080 --> 16:00.030
Which was stupid, because
the whole tribe heard it,

16:00.080 --> 16:02.430
and saw her belting it through the forest,

16:02.480 --> 16:05.150
and were like, "She is not allowed
on that horse, get her back!"

16:05.200 --> 16:08.510
But she just kept going and going
and she was faster than them.

16:08.560 --> 16:12.560
So she galloped over the
sacred bridge, across the lake,

16:12.960 --> 16:16.960
and did the four miles through the
mud all the way to Barney's hut.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.350
And then they made love...

16:19.400 --> 16:21.270
in the storm.

16:21.320 --> 16:24.990
And it was amazing.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.950
And then what happened?

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
And then... they hanged
her. For being a witch.

16:31.800 --> 16:35.800
But at least she fucking did it, you know?

16:56.400 --> 16:59.230
Hey!

16:59.280 --> 17:00.950
What are you doing?!

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
And having that time apart
has really opened our minds.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.550
And we're even thinking... I can't
believe I'm telling you this,

17:08.599 --> 17:12.599
but we're even thinking of trying
a sort of more open relationship.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
- Oh, yes?
- Yeah, well, we both have people that we want to, um...

17:17.359 --> 17:21.359
well, to be frank, have sex
with. Apart from each other.

17:21.920 --> 17:25.069
And since Steve's already spent
a few nights with Miss Collins...

17:25.119 --> 17:28.920
She's stunning, by the way,
used to be a high-jumper.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.350
.. I thought it would be fair for me

17:31.400 --> 17:34.150
to have an equivalent experience
with someone I like the look of.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.630
Sounds very healthy.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.190
Don't worry, we're not about
to start propositioning you,

17:38.240 --> 17:41.150
- that's not what this is about.
- Hm. Great.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.630
- Only thing is, we do have a rule.
- Yeah.

17:43.680 --> 17:47.270
Which is, we are not allowed
to fall in love with anyone.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.190
How can you have a rule
not to fall in love?

17:49.240 --> 17:52.150
- It's not a choice.
- It's funny, we've been doing it for a while now,

17:52.200 --> 17:55.910
- haven't we, Maurice?
- Have you? Gosh, that makes me feel so much better.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.510
You see? I told you it's not
weird... everyone's doing it.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.310
In fact I slept with someone last night

18:00.360 --> 18:03.990
and we haven't even talked
about it yet, have we?

18:04.040 --> 18:05.710
You all right there, Maurice?

18:05.760 --> 18:08.500
Bit spicy for you? The food, I mean?

18:09.280 --> 18:11.230
Who with, then? Go on.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.150
- Barry.
- R-r-really?

18:14.200 --> 18:18.200
Mm. Yes. He was very
sensitive. And very hairy.

18:22.120 --> 18:25.430
What about you, then, Maurice?

18:25.480 --> 18:28.510
I'll give you a clue. Um...

18:28.560 --> 18:29.790
Sushi.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.270
- Have you lost your mind?
- No! The Japanese guy?

18:33.320 --> 18:35.310
Not just an illustrator, is he, Maurice?

18:35.360 --> 18:37.350
I think it's great, Maurice.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.790
Here's to a bit of sideways.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.870
A bit of sideways!

18:41.920 --> 18:44.430
This is insane. Everything
about this is insane.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.990
We're surrounded by naked people

18:46.040 --> 18:47.950
having dinner with complete strangers.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.750
This spoon is the weirdest spoon
I've ever seen in my life,

18:50.800 --> 18:52.830
and this lamb, it's not
even lamb, it's beef.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.110
I think they just got the order wrong.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.430
OK, let's just have a time-out.

18:57.480 --> 19:01.480
Maybe we'll just get a few side
dishes and just chill for a bit.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.150
Yeah, that's a great
idea, isn't it, Steve(?)

19:04.200 --> 19:07.430
- These peas are lovely.
- Mm, great.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.390
Mmm. Nice, innit?

19:10.440 --> 19:11.910
Delicious.

19:14.840 --> 19:18.510
Oh, yeah, delicious, isn't it(?)
More wine, please, waiter.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.510
Don't get too close, though.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.870
I might suddenly fuck
you in front of my wife

19:22.920 --> 19:25.390
because that's our arrangement.

19:38.120 --> 19:41.070
So this is how you treat me now?
After everything I've done for you,

19:41.120 --> 19:43.070
you deliberately try and hurt my feelings?

19:43.120 --> 19:44.510
Well, it's not very hard, is it?

19:44.560 --> 19:48.560
I have a very strong emotional
constitution, thank you very much.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.110
Your eyebrows are stupid.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.110
How dare you?!

19:54.160 --> 19:57.990
I've been swimming in that pool all
day waiting for you to come back.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.870
- Now, pack your bags! We're leaving town.
- Why?

20:01.920 --> 20:05.830
- Because you're out of control.
- I just went for a drink. - No.

20:05.880 --> 20:09.870
I smell sex like a shark smells blood.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.630
And you REEK of it!

20:11.680 --> 20:14.310
It doesn't matter how silly
you think the costumes are...

20:14.360 --> 20:16.790
- That place was ludicrous.
- .. you don't walk out on me...

20:16.840 --> 20:19.550
- It was like a brothel that served food.
- .. in front of our friends.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.310
They're not friends. I won't sit there

20:21.360 --> 20:23.950
- while you randomly accuse me of being gay...
- Are you gay or not?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.310
.. excusing the fact you
committed brazen adultery

20:26.360 --> 20:29.070
right under my nose and you
don't seem to feel any guilt.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.310
What do you mean?! You
haven't even asked me.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.910
- You're a thieving Sapphic demon!
- No, no, no.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.510
- .. all the way back from town!
- No, Donald, no.

20:36.560 --> 20:40.560
Either this succubus is sabotaging
me or she is a Sideways Sally.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.990
- Oh, yeah.
- Donald, be quiet.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.790
And she's blatantly in love with Abigail

20:45.840 --> 20:48.430
because she's trying to steal
her from me and I caught them

20:48.480 --> 20:51.390
canoodling in the forest like
a pair of heartless lesbians.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.910
And here's the proof!

20:53.960 --> 20:58.710
- Donald! - Don't you dare! - The
proof is in the pudding, sister!

20:58.760 --> 21:01.710
- You want a piece? You want
a piece?! - OK! - Get up!

21:01.760 --> 21:03.510
Get off me!

21:03.560 --> 21:07.030
- Stop it!
- Aaaargh! - Whoa! Whoa!

21:07.080 --> 21:09.350
Well, guess what, I love her too.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.750
And you can't always get everything
you want just because you're insane!

21:12.800 --> 21:15.510
Look, let's all just calm down here.

21:15.560 --> 21:19.560
Whatever Amy is experiencing,
that's her gift to share with us

21:19.880 --> 21:22.350
- when she's ready.
- Dad, what are you talking about?

21:22.400 --> 21:24.990
- I already told you.
- Yeah.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.910
- But I thought it was a secret.
- Well, it's not now, is it? - No.

21:28.960 --> 21:32.960
So... Well, well done.
Really well done, very brave.

21:33.560 --> 21:37.230
- Don't clap it! Jesus.
- Sorry. - Did everybody know apart from me?

21:37.280 --> 21:39.310
Mum...

21:39.360 --> 21:41.910
Why didn't you tell me?

21:41.960 --> 21:43.070
Because.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.790
- Because what? Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.270
Why did you tell him before me?

21:47.320 --> 21:49.110
Don't take it personally, Deborah,

21:49.160 --> 21:51.470
these things need to come
out organically sometimes.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.390
Maybe she didn't have an opportunity yet.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.470
Well, thank you for the
insight, Mr Perfect Dad.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.230
Why are you suddenly so knowledgeable?!

21:57.280 --> 21:59.270
- Because I can relate to her.
- And why is that?

21:59.320 --> 22:00.950
Is that because you're gay as well?!

22:01.000 --> 22:04.550
- It's Shun, isn't it? He's your geisha, isn't he?
- Yeah.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.550
Yes, he is, yeah. He's my
concubine, that's right.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.270
- Yeah.
- He's my illustrator!

22:09.320 --> 22:12.350
AKA, he illustrates your
dick. How about that?

22:12.400 --> 22:15.230
- This is getting stupid now.
- What do you mean, you can relate to her?

22:15.280 --> 22:17.750
Because I find you very
difficult to talk to sometimes.

22:17.800 --> 22:21.270
- You just mumble and wander off...
- I find you very difficult to talk to sometimes.

22:21.320 --> 22:24.830
- So, would you fuck me if I dressed as a samurai?
- I'm not gay!

22:24.880 --> 22:26.150
Amy's gay.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.630
I know Amy's gay and I'm very
happy for her for being gay

22:28.680 --> 22:30.150
but I'm not married to Amy, am I?

22:30.200 --> 22:34.200
I don't know what the hell you think
you're doing, but it's not helping.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.990
Could you all just leave me
alone for five minutes, please?

22:40.040 --> 22:41.230
Did something go wrong...?

22:41.280 --> 22:43.270
Oh, fuck off, fucking children!

22:43.320 --> 22:47.320
Fuck off! Fuck's sake!

22:55.240 --> 22:59.240
Whoo! Flower's family very angry with me.

23:00.080 --> 23:03.390
Never mind. Challenge for Grubbs.

23:03.440 --> 23:07.440
We must think idea for new adventure.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.710
Make better for Mr Flowers.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.070
You know English Bible.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.630
If somebody punch you in the face,

23:15.680 --> 23:18.830
turn you other face. Just
punch you face again.

23:18.880 --> 23:22.430
Jesus-san! He is teaching this, very wise.

23:23.880 --> 23:27.880
Yes. You know, Grubbs, you
probably understand how I feeling.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.670
Carol and the Caroll not like you.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.630
Flowers not like me. Doesn't matter.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.680
Challenge! Let's go! Faster!

23:38.840 --> 23:42.840
I'm so happy!

23:55.160 --> 23:58.190
In the shoddiest cove,
I'll envelop the rest

23:58.240 --> 24:01.630
I feel awake enough to tell this

24:01.680 --> 24:03.790
It was a seminal plan

24:03.840 --> 24:07.840
A plan to pull you through...
