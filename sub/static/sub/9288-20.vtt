00:12.573 --> 00:13.938
Right now

00:14.041 --> 00:17.533
terrorists are plotting to assassinate
a presidential candidate.

00:18.179 --> 00:20.739
My wife and daughter have been targeted

00:20.848 --> 00:24.284
and people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:24.919 --> 00:27.251
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer

00:27.355 --> 00:30.847
and today is the longest day of my life.

01:23.210 --> 01:26.179
You know, Jack, I take back what I said.
It's getting dull.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.301
That helicopter made
a fly-by for a reason.

01:28.409 --> 01:30.182
Maybe, maybe not.

01:31.085 --> 01:33.019
Come here, help me with this.

01:35.222 --> 01:37.690
1, 2, 3...

01:41.028 --> 01:43.588
There's nothing here.
We're wasting our time.

01:43.698 --> 01:47.634
Alexis tried to pay off a power company
official to cut off the electricity...

01:47.835 --> 01:49.803
...at this location at 7:20 for a reason.

01:49.904 --> 01:53.067
They want something here,
have gone to extremes to shut it down.

01:56.243 --> 01:57.369
Mason.

01:58.612 --> 02:00.102
Excellent news.

02:00.748 --> 02:02.147
Half an hour.

02:02.249 --> 02:04.444
Don't let anyone in or out
until we get there.

02:04.585 --> 02:08.043
Alexis Drazen's out of surgery.
We should be there when he wakes up.

02:08.155 --> 02:09.213
You go ahead.

02:09.323 --> 02:12.121
Jack, we were fed misinformation.

02:12.693 --> 02:16.151
The address in the file. The time
Morgan gave you. The whole thing.

02:16.263 --> 02:18.356
Look around.
There's nothing here. Nothing.

02:18.466 --> 02:21.629
- Maybe.
- But you're going to stick around anyway?

02:23.237 --> 02:27.196
It's 7:03, George.
I want to be here at 7:20.

02:28.476 --> 02:31.001
You can send a car back for me, okay?

02:31.145 --> 02:33.579
I promise, I won't disappear on you.

02:33.748 --> 02:36.273
I don't have time to argue with you.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.829
Oh, my God.

02:55.569 --> 02:58.163
You sit right here. Stay right there.

03:01.876 --> 03:04.676
- Who the hell was that guy?
- I don't know.

03:12.353 --> 03:14.412
Teri, it's okay.

03:14.555 --> 03:16.648
I'm rlght here.

03:17.958 --> 03:20.688
Listen to me. Take a breath.

03:21.562 --> 03:23.120
I can't.

03:23.464 --> 03:25.455
I saw the car explode.

03:25.666 --> 03:27.998
- Teri...
- There was nothing left!

03:28.369 --> 03:32.601
Kim is alive. She got out before
the explosion. I talked to her. All right?

03:32.773 --> 03:35.071
She was fine. She was worried about you.

03:35.176 --> 03:38.703
Now I need your help.
I need to get you back to CTU. Come on.

03:38.813 --> 03:41.839
- Oh, my God.
- I need your help, Teri. Come on.

03:42.149 --> 03:46.108
What did she say when you talked to her?
Where is she?

03:46.220 --> 03:48.245
- We don't know. She wouldn't say.
- What?

03:48.355 --> 03:51.153
After the safe house, she didn't trust us.
I don't blame her.

03:51.258 --> 03:53.556
- Get in here.
- We have to find her...

03:53.661 --> 03:56.755
Believe me, we're looking. Get in the car!

04:06.907 --> 04:09.273
Where's Jack?
Does he know what's happening?

04:09.410 --> 04:12.538
He's out on assignment.
I should hear from him soon, though.

04:21.154 --> 04:24.249
- Myers.
- It's me. I found Teri at the Bauer house.

04:24.358 --> 04:26.952
Someone was trying to kill her,
I took him down.

04:27.061 --> 04:29.291
Send a team over there
in case he's got backup.

04:29.396 --> 04:30.863
Of course. is she all right?

04:30.965 --> 04:34.093
She will be. She's suffering from
temporary memory loss.

04:34.268 --> 04:36.236
She's got a friend with her, too.

04:36.337 --> 04:38.396
A pretty good one,
by the way he's acting.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.734
Wait a minute.
Are you sure? Who is this guy?

04:40.875 --> 04:43.708
His name is Phil Parslow.
She vouches for him.

04:43.811 --> 04:45.506
She's known him for a long time.

04:45.613 --> 04:47.103
He was hit, but not too badly.

04:47.214 --> 04:49.910
- Okay. Where are you?
- Twenty, thirty minutes away.

04:50.050 --> 04:52.814
Take him to the clinic.
I'll send someone to question him.

04:52.987 --> 04:55.717
- I think you should bring Teri here.
- Okay.

05:02.863 --> 05:04.262
Don't I get a phone call?

05:04.365 --> 05:06.299
Let's go, lock them down. Come on.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.392
- I need to talk to someone.
- Don't we all?

05:09.503 --> 05:11.767
Don't listen to the bitch. She lies.

05:12.540 --> 05:15.065
You'll get a chance for that
after we put you through.

05:15.175 --> 05:17.370
Come on with me. You're mine.

05:31.358 --> 05:34.418
They're going to ask you
about Frank and the deal.

05:34.528 --> 05:37.224
- I don't know anything about it.
- Tell them that.

05:37.464 --> 05:39.932
You were just at the wrong place,
at the wrong time.

05:40.034 --> 05:42.298
I should tell them about
everything else, too.

05:42.403 --> 05:44.234
I mean, what happened today.

05:44.338 --> 05:47.432
After the safe house,
I'm not sure if I can trust anybody.

05:48.943 --> 05:52.344
- You trust me, right?
- Yeah, and look where it got me.

05:54.148 --> 05:57.606
I trust you,
I know you're trying to do the right thing.

05:57.718 --> 05:59.481
Okay, then listen to me.

05:59.687 --> 06:01.450
Tell them everything.

06:02.189 --> 06:05.158
What happened at the safe house
has nothing to do with this.

06:05.826 --> 06:08.056
Whatever you tell them, I'll back it up.

06:08.195 --> 06:10.129
Including my part in it.

06:13.968 --> 06:17.028
- You're going to get in trouble.
- Then I'll get in trouble.

06:17.137 --> 06:19.901
It's about time I faced up to what I did.

06:20.808 --> 06:22.105
All right.

06:23.577 --> 06:24.874
You're up.

07:12.226 --> 07:13.955
How are you feeling?

07:14.828 --> 07:16.386
I'm fine, Daddy.

07:17.398 --> 07:19.093
Relieved, actually.

07:20.734 --> 07:22.463
I think that maybe...

07:23.103 --> 07:26.197
...living with a secret
is harder work than I thought.

07:28.676 --> 07:32.203
I'd be lying to you if I told you
the hard work was over.

07:33.547 --> 07:35.412
You're going to be asked some questions...

07:35.516 --> 07:38.485
...we all are, that we'd rather
not deal with.

07:39.153 --> 07:41.212
But if we stick together...

07:42.122 --> 07:44.056
...we'll get through it.

08:01.909 --> 08:04.969
Could you give your mother
and me a few minutes?

08:28.535 --> 08:29.832
I'm sorry.

08:32.272 --> 08:33.466
I...

08:34.775 --> 08:37.243
...didn't mean to interrupt your...

08:37.578 --> 08:39.068
...celebration.

08:41.582 --> 08:43.573
You could have joined it.

08:43.751 --> 08:47.778
I'm not in the mood to celebrate
the end of your campaign, David.

08:51.692 --> 08:53.990
You just gave your concession speech.

08:54.094 --> 08:56.062
That remains to be seen.

08:58.465 --> 09:01.400
Do you really think
people want a president...

09:01.502 --> 09:05.438
...who acts like some guest
on a bad afternoon talk show...

09:05.672 --> 09:08.004
...confessing his sins publicly?

09:08.242 --> 09:11.143
It's always possible that they want
someone honest.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.978
Mike seems to think I still have a shot.

09:16.083 --> 09:19.246
It's Mike's job
to tell you what you want to hear.

09:19.853 --> 09:21.047
Mine...

09:21.655 --> 09:23.282
...is to tell you the truth.

09:23.390 --> 09:25.984
You're not qualified to tell me the truth.

09:28.996 --> 09:31.897
It took 13 minutes for you to tear apart...

09:32.065 --> 09:35.592
...everything that it took us
25 years to build.

09:35.836 --> 09:38.896
Why don't you just let me
mourn that loss, okay?

09:39.439 --> 09:40.804
Fair enough.

09:46.547 --> 09:51.109
I only hope your conscience comforts you
when you finally realize this is all over.

09:51.285 --> 09:53.378
You mean the campaign or us?

11:33.020 --> 11:34.715
Confirm, Alpha 1.

11:34.988 --> 11:36.615
This is Alpha 1.

11:37.124 --> 11:38.751
Bauer's gone below.

11:38.926 --> 11:40.393
Positive it was Bauer?

11:40.494 --> 11:41.518
Yes.

11:43.196 --> 11:44.493
What's he doing here?

11:44.865 --> 11:47.333
He wasn't invited, that's for sure.

13:09.816 --> 13:12.512
My name is Jack Bauer. I work for CTU.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.480
I know who you are, Agent Bauer.
I checked you out.

13:16.590 --> 13:18.649
My name is DeSalvo. D.O.D.

13:19.326 --> 13:23.524
Whatever this place is, it's obvious
that no one's supposed to know it's here.

13:23.897 --> 13:25.888
You seem to have found it okay.

13:26.233 --> 13:29.066
This is a prison facility.
Class 3 detention center.

13:29.269 --> 13:31.533
What the hell are you doing here?

13:31.638 --> 13:33.970
At 8:00 a. m. this morning...

13:34.074 --> 13:36.702
...there was an assassination attempt
on Senator Palmer.

13:36.810 --> 13:41.110
I'm the lead investigator.
I was following the thread. It led me here.

13:42.649 --> 13:44.480
I need more than that.

13:46.920 --> 13:50.515
The people that want Palmer dead
bribed someone from the power company...

13:50.657 --> 13:53.820
...to shut down the electricity to the grid
that you're hooked into.

13:53.927 --> 13:56.487
They were ordered to do this at 7:20.

13:59.399 --> 14:02.562
Something's going to happen here
then, isn't it?

14:05.305 --> 14:07.796
Mr. DeSalvo, you better listen to me.

14:07.941 --> 14:11.741
The people behind this assassination
attempt are ex-military Serbs.

14:11.845 --> 14:14.313
Working for a family called Drazen.
It's a vendetta.

14:14.414 --> 14:16.712
They've killed a lot of people
and will kill more...

14:16.817 --> 14:19.843
...unless we do something.
Please, sir, I'll ask one more time.

14:19.986 --> 14:22.887
What is happening here at 7:20?

14:31.164 --> 14:33.462
A prisoner's being delivered by chopper.

14:33.567 --> 14:34.591
Who?

14:35.202 --> 14:37.067
His identity is classified, even from me.

14:37.170 --> 14:39.968
They move him every few weeks randomly.
What do these...

14:40.540 --> 14:42.440
...Drazens want with him, anyway?

14:42.642 --> 14:45.304
It's hard to tell
unless I know who the prisoner is.

14:45.412 --> 14:48.313
They might want to kill him.
They might want to set him free.

14:48.415 --> 14:51.145
Either way, you've got about five minutes.

14:51.251 --> 14:54.015
- Call for backup.
- Backup can't get here in five minutes.

14:54.121 --> 14:55.213
Call anyway.

14:55.422 --> 14:58.220
If I'm wrong,
you've gone through a little trouble.

14:58.325 --> 15:02.625
I'll take the heat for that. If I'm right,
you've saved every life in this building.

15:05.265 --> 15:06.357
Please.

15:12.806 --> 15:15.206
Have Wycoff call me ASAP.

15:16.109 --> 15:18.703
Thank you. What's your personnel here?

15:20.747 --> 15:23.739
Three guards plus a maintenance man,
two technicians.

15:23.850 --> 15:28.344
- Are they weapons-trained?
- They've never fired a weapon in their lives.

15:28.455 --> 15:30.320
The Drazens don't know that.

15:30.457 --> 15:32.948
Issue them full service gear.
Have them stand by.

15:33.059 --> 15:34.458
To do what exactly?

15:34.561 --> 15:37.587
To make this place
look more secure than it is.

15:37.797 --> 15:39.992
At least until backup arrives.

15:54.748 --> 15:56.340
It's almost time.

15:56.850 --> 15:58.340
Three minutes.

15:59.753 --> 16:02.813
- You still haven't heard from your brother?
- No.

16:03.256 --> 16:06.089
He was to verify his meeting
with the power company man.

16:06.193 --> 16:08.684
If there was a problem,
he would have called.

16:11.831 --> 16:13.799
You seem anxious, Harris.

16:14.501 --> 16:16.560
I thought professionals didn't get anxious.

16:16.670 --> 16:19.901
Professionals get very anxious
when a plan goes off the tracks.

16:20.040 --> 16:23.271
- There's nothing wrong with the plan.
- Then what's Bauer doing here?

16:23.410 --> 16:25.810
Just get your men ready. It's time.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.139
Come here.

16:56.543 --> 16:58.067
No. Like this.

16:58.245 --> 16:59.769
All right, let's get moving.

16:59.879 --> 17:02.245
Keep the stock in tight,
keep your weapon down.

17:02.349 --> 17:04.442
- You're going to be all right.
- Okay.

17:05.484 --> 17:08.249
- Any word on the backup?
- They're looking into it.

17:10.557 --> 17:11.717
Weapon.

17:19.031 --> 17:20.226
We good?

17:20.733 --> 17:21.962
Yes, sir.

17:23.936 --> 17:25.733
- Let's go.
- All right.

18:04.444 --> 18:07.208
Put your men in front of the lights
so they can be seen.

18:07.380 --> 18:10.008
Form a line right in front of the lights.

18:10.216 --> 18:12.810
Look like you're ready for something.

18:14.954 --> 18:16.285
45 seconds.

18:22.796 --> 18:25.321
You said there'd be a warden
and three guards.

18:25.498 --> 18:28.262
I count eight, including Bauer.

18:31.271 --> 18:34.172
- They're expecting us, Andre.
- Doesn't matter.

18:34.274 --> 18:39.007
The power's going down in 25 seconds.
The sudden darkness will disorient them.

18:39.112 --> 18:42.104
- What if there is no darkness?
- There will be.

18:47.887 --> 18:48.876
Go!

18:53.326 --> 18:54.486
Eight more seconds.

18:55.261 --> 18:56.728
Five, four...

18:57.364 --> 18:59.696
...three, two, one.

19:00.033 --> 19:02.194
Perimeter lights are still on.

19:02.302 --> 19:03.394
Damn it!

19:10.643 --> 19:15.171
- All right. We're still going.
- No. Security's twice what we anticipated.

19:15.281 --> 19:18.114
The lights are on. We'll be cut to pieces.

19:23.189 --> 19:26.317
- Get ready to move.
- We have to stand down.

19:26.626 --> 19:30.392
- My money, my decision.
- My crew. They'll obey my orders.

19:40.440 --> 19:41.737
All right.

19:42.842 --> 19:45.174
Plans have changed. Stand down.

20:31.257 --> 20:32.155
Sit down.

20:32.325 --> 20:34.054
My father's Jack Bauer.

20:36.863 --> 20:37.887
Sit.

20:42.368 --> 20:45.599
He's the director
of the Los Angeles Bureau of CTU.

20:45.705 --> 20:48.435
Counter Terrorist Unit.
Have you heard of it?

20:48.541 --> 20:50.509
I can't say that I have.

20:50.944 --> 20:52.809
Do you want the number?

20:55.315 --> 20:58.682
What I want is
information on Frank Allard...

20:58.785 --> 21:03.279
...and his plans to buy and distribute
1,000 hits of ecstasy, that's it.

21:03.556 --> 21:07.549
I don't know him. I met him
for the first time a couple hours ago.

21:15.502 --> 21:18.630
Do you know that someone tried to kill
David Palmer this morning?

21:19.973 --> 21:20.997
Yes.

21:21.374 --> 21:23.706
Aren't you curious how I know about it?

21:24.410 --> 21:27.971
I don't know. Maybe because it's been
on the news the last 12 hours.

21:28.414 --> 21:31.144
I didn't realize that. I was kidnapped...

21:31.518 --> 21:34.248
...by the same people
who are trying to kill Senator Palmer.

21:34.420 --> 21:35.887
I know this sounds crazy.

21:36.422 --> 21:39.414
They kidnapped my mother,
tried to get my father to help them...

21:39.526 --> 21:40.493
...but he rescued us.

21:40.593 --> 21:43.994
And then he dropped you off at Frankie's
so you could...

21:44.097 --> 21:45.997
...what, earn spending money
dealing drugs?

21:46.099 --> 21:46.929
No.

21:47.033 --> 21:49.934
They brought us to a safe house,
but it was attacked.

21:50.103 --> 21:52.867
And I think they captured my mother again.

21:53.473 --> 21:56.067
Okay. She told me you had
an active imagination.

21:56.376 --> 21:58.640
- She wasn't kidding.
- Who?

21:59.078 --> 22:01.512
Your friend, the one we picked you up with.

22:02.115 --> 22:04.276
Melanie? No.

22:04.751 --> 22:07.379
She's not my friend.
She thinks I'm after her boyfriend.

22:07.487 --> 22:09.921
You can't believe
anything she says about me.

22:12.525 --> 22:14.789
I'm going to stick you
back in the holding cell.

22:14.928 --> 22:17.294
Maybe that will convince you
not to screw around.

22:17.397 --> 22:18.659
Call this number.

22:18.998 --> 22:21.796
Tell them I am Jack Bauer's daughter
and that I'm here.

22:21.901 --> 22:24.734
Ask them if they think I'm screwing around.

22:29.309 --> 22:30.503
Come on.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.717
DeSalvo, wait.

22:38.818 --> 22:42.049
Just because they haven't attacked
doesn't mean they won't.

22:42.155 --> 22:44.214
Maybe this is a crock
and there's nobody there.

22:44.324 --> 22:45.848
Drazen's crew is out there.

22:45.959 --> 22:49.451
They didn't shut down the power.
They're working on a contingency plan.

22:49.562 --> 22:51.757
Trust me, I know these people.

22:54.033 --> 22:56.160
I've requested backup.
Not much else I can do.

22:56.269 --> 22:58.032
There is. Let me talk to that prisoner.

22:58.137 --> 23:00.128
Forget it. I can't give access.

23:00.239 --> 23:03.106
My orders are explicit.
I can't even speak to him myself.

23:03.209 --> 23:05.234
Do you understand
everything happening here...

23:05.345 --> 23:07.905
...is connected to the assassination
attempt on Palmer?

23:08.014 --> 23:11.006
If you don't let me interrogate him,
Palmer's life is in danger.

23:11.117 --> 23:12.607
Do you want that responsibility?

23:12.719 --> 23:17.088
You are welcome to go over my head
if you want, but I can't help you.

23:17.190 --> 23:19.454
Now, I got to process this guy.

23:19.759 --> 23:20.817
Wait.

23:21.828 --> 23:24.626
- You said you worked for the D.O.D., right?
- And?

23:25.732 --> 23:27.666
Can I borrow your phone?

23:29.669 --> 23:33.105
Yes, I want to clear every interview
that Nicole gives.

23:33.339 --> 23:34.829
Yes, personally.

23:34.941 --> 23:37.535
Whenever possible, I want to be there.

23:37.777 --> 23:39.472
Let me know.

23:42.348 --> 23:45.340
Is it as bad
as Sherry said it would be?

23:45.685 --> 23:48.210
...predlcted a sharp drop
in Senator Palmer's numbers...

23:48.321 --> 23:50.152
...It's not turning out that way.

23:50.256 --> 23:53.248
Our instant polls indicate
that the Senator's base of support...

23:53.359 --> 23:55.691
...Is holding steady in most areas
of the country...

23:55.795 --> 23:58.821
...and in some cases,
It's actually increasing.

23:58.998 --> 24:00.863
When asked if the Senator's disclosures...

24:00.967 --> 24:04.130
...made them more llkely to vote for him
in the general election...

24:04.237 --> 24:08.674
...less likely, or made no difference at all,
60 percent said "No Difference... "

24:08.908 --> 24:11.342
...22 percent said "More Llkely... "

24:11.544 --> 24:14.274
...while only 18 percent said "Less Llkely. "

24:15.548 --> 24:16.845
Looks like you were right.

24:17.016 --> 24:18.449
...over the coming months...

24:18.551 --> 24:20.485
...seems to indicate that voters approved...

24:20.586 --> 24:23.918
...of Senator Palmer's honesty
before a national television audience...

24:24.023 --> 24:25.786
...a little more than a half hour ago.

24:26.993 --> 24:28.324
Senator.

24:28.494 --> 24:31.088
It's a Jack Bauer. He says it's urgent.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.757
Thank you. Jack, it's me.

24:35.034 --> 24:38.265
- Did you get anything from Alexis?
- No. He's out of surgery now...

24:38.371 --> 24:40.771
...but I followed a lead
we got from his hotel room.

24:40.873 --> 24:43.000
- I'm going to need your help.
- Go on.

24:43.109 --> 24:45.543
I'm at a Class 3 detention facility.

24:45.645 --> 24:47.237
It's a prison that doesn't exist.

24:47.346 --> 24:49.405
Neither does the prisoner they brought in.

24:49.515 --> 24:52.006
- Who's the prisoner?
- That's where I'll need your help.

24:52.118 --> 24:54.143
The Department of Defense runs this place.

24:54.253 --> 24:55.652
You want me to pull strings...

24:55.755 --> 24:58.918
I need access to the prisoner
as soon as you can make it happen.

24:59.025 --> 25:01.926
The facility's located in Saugus
at the address you gave me.

25:02.028 --> 25:06.260
The warden's name is DeSalvo.
He's reasonable, but his hands are tied.

25:06.365 --> 25:08.799
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you, sir.

26:36.155 --> 26:38.919
Come on, you son of a bitch, turn around.

26:57.777 --> 27:00.109
Damn it, that prisoner's identity
is classified!

27:00.213 --> 27:02.681
I told you I need to know
who that prisoner is.

27:02.782 --> 27:03.771
No.

27:14.694 --> 27:16.252
It's impossible.

27:18.698 --> 27:20.325
You recognize him?

27:21.367 --> 27:23.130
That's Victor Drazen.

27:23.836 --> 27:25.133
Who is he?

27:25.738 --> 27:28.002
A man I killed two years ago.

27:51.764 --> 27:53.254
All right, listen.

27:53.366 --> 27:55.732
You're asking me to risk my job,
maybe go to jail.

27:55.835 --> 27:57.496
I need some quid pro quo.

27:57.737 --> 27:59.329
What's your connection to this guy?

28:02.408 --> 28:05.536
What I'm about to tell you
is secured information.

28:05.645 --> 28:08.079
Two years ago, a congressional
subcommittee decided...

28:08.180 --> 28:11.274
...that Victor Drazen was the key threat
to the peace in Bosnia.

28:11.417 --> 28:14.511
They authorized a mission to take him out.
I led that mission.

28:14.921 --> 28:16.946
When we got there, things went wrong.

28:17.056 --> 28:20.685
Today, I found out that his wife
and daughter were killed in the attack.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.958
I thought we'd killed Victor,
but apparently, I was wrong.

28:24.363 --> 28:26.661
Now his sons want to break him out.

28:26.832 --> 28:29.323
More than that,
they want to exact a revenge on me.

28:29.435 --> 28:32.063
Earlier today,
his people kidnapped my wife and daughter.

28:32.171 --> 28:34.071
We got them back. They're safe for now.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.271
But if Victor Drazen escapes from here...

28:36.375 --> 28:39.867
...I lose any leverage I've got of keeping
his people away from my family.

28:41.414 --> 28:44.281
- I'll make another call.
- We don't have time for calls.

28:44.617 --> 28:47.814
We need to take this prisoner
and move him ourselves now.

28:48.654 --> 28:50.645
I said I'll make a call.

28:53.826 --> 28:58.354
- We still need to cut the power.
- But your brother hasn't contacted us yet.

28:59.065 --> 29:02.762
He would have called by now
if he were alive.

29:04.036 --> 29:06.334
We should assume Alexis is dead.

29:07.206 --> 29:09.606
There may be another way, though.

29:10.443 --> 29:13.935
The substation for this sector
is a half mile from here.

29:14.180 --> 29:16.978
A few ounces of C-5 should be sufficient.

29:17.416 --> 29:20.214
To save tlme, we'll go in through the front.

29:21.487 --> 29:24.251
The idea is not to attract attention.

29:25.758 --> 29:28.625
The idea is to get my father out of prison.

29:30.162 --> 29:32.892
This is the best chance we'll ever have.

29:38.571 --> 29:40.232
These don't match.

29:41.607 --> 29:42.767
Hold on.

29:43.242 --> 29:47.008
- Where's Jack? I thought he was with you.
- He opted to stay in the field.

29:47.113 --> 29:49.581
- In Saugus?
- The address he got from the Drazen file.

29:49.915 --> 29:52.145
What's he doing?
Why didn't he come back with you?

29:52.251 --> 29:55.709
I don't know. He's a stubborn guy.
He insisted on staying.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.489
Meanwhile, Alexis Drazen
came to at the hospital...

29:58.591 --> 30:00.718
...so I headed over there to interrogate him.

30:00.893 --> 30:03.361
He hasn't talked yet,
but I cut off his morphine.

30:03.462 --> 30:05.225
He should be chatty in about an hour.

30:05.331 --> 30:07.492
You didn't tell Jack about his family?

30:07.767 --> 30:10.361
- What are you doing, George?
- What are you doing?

30:10.536 --> 30:12.766
Last time I checked,
it wasn't a part of my job...

30:12.872 --> 30:15.306
...to have to explain myself
to my subordinates.

30:15.574 --> 30:18.236
Unless they've called off the hit
on Palmer's life...

30:18.577 --> 30:21.569
...you should be working
on securing his day's agenda, right?

30:22.381 --> 30:25.441
Looks like he's going to be
our next president.

30:27.553 --> 30:28.850
Thank you.

30:35.995 --> 30:38.964
Senator David Palmer
has already carried New York...

30:39.065 --> 30:42.364
...and with the polls closing shortly
here in California...

30:49.942 --> 30:53.002
Everyone's outside celebrating
the latest poll.

30:53.245 --> 30:55.179
Come on out, sweetheart.

31:05.291 --> 31:07.782
What is it? What's wrong now?

31:09.261 --> 31:11.752
Before, when you said it was over...

31:12.398 --> 31:16.459
...and I asked you what you meant,
the campaign or me?

31:16.635 --> 31:19.729
What I said came out of wanting
to protect my family...

31:19.839 --> 31:21.830
...wanting to protect you.

31:22.274 --> 31:24.542
You can't hold that against me.

31:25.344 --> 31:26.641
Sherry...

31:30.116 --> 31:32.050
You're an amazing woman.

31:32.818 --> 31:36.117
Smart, determined, sure of yourself.

31:37.389 --> 31:39.755
You always know what you want.

31:42.294 --> 31:44.694
But you don't want me, not really.

31:47.700 --> 31:50.897
I don't think you've wanted me
for a very long time.

31:51.170 --> 31:53.138
- That's nonsense.
- Is it?

31:54.373 --> 31:58.070
Maybe if everything with Nicole
and Keith never happened...

31:58.811 --> 32:00.608
...but it did happen.

32:01.614 --> 32:04.879
And you kept the truth from me
for all these years.

32:06.085 --> 32:09.020
I don't think you could have done that
without pulling away.

32:14.894 --> 32:16.191
And now...

32:21.967 --> 32:25.528
Now I can't help thinking
that I don't trust you anymore.

32:30.876 --> 32:32.935
And if I can't trust you...

32:35.014 --> 32:36.709
...how could I love you?

32:43.155 --> 32:44.622
Well, David...

32:46.458 --> 32:50.326
...you may not love me,
but you will never leave me.

33:00.439 --> 33:04.068
You take all the time you need
to get yourself together...

33:04.210 --> 33:07.646
...and then you come out
and you greet all the people...

33:07.746 --> 33:10.078
...who have given up every day...

33:10.316 --> 33:14.480
...and every night of their lives
for the last year...

33:15.087 --> 33:16.987
...to put us in office.

33:18.090 --> 33:20.422
- Us?
- Yes.

33:21.894 --> 33:24.886
That's right. Us.

33:27.032 --> 33:31.435
Because come January,
when you're being sworn in...

33:32.137 --> 33:34.367
...make no mistake about it...

33:35.407 --> 33:39.867
...this woman here
will be standing right next to you.

34:10.342 --> 34:11.775
Open up, two.

34:27.926 --> 34:30.985
Move away from the door. Now.

34:36.201 --> 34:39.364
Hey, Martinez, settle down over there.

35:08.934 --> 35:12.836
One thing I don't get. If Drazen
was the target, what's he doing here?

35:13.339 --> 35:15.899
Someone thought he was
more valuable alive than dead.

35:16.008 --> 35:18.203
By "someone," you mean
one of our people?

35:18.477 --> 35:21.037
He's probably been feeding them
intelligence.

35:23.749 --> 35:26.877
Why put you and your men
through the charade of trying to kill him?

35:26.985 --> 35:30.011
Because they wanted the rest of the world
to think he was dead.

35:30.322 --> 35:32.756
My mission was set up to fail
from the start.

35:33.125 --> 35:35.525
I lost every man I went in there with.

35:38.997 --> 35:40.191
DeSalvo.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.531
Yeah, he's right here.

35:44.603 --> 35:45.831
I understand.

35:45.938 --> 35:47.462
We got permission to move Drazen?

35:47.573 --> 35:50.804
No. That request is still working
its way up the chain of command.

35:50.909 --> 35:52.809
But D.O.D. says you can interrogate him.

35:52.945 --> 35:55.243
- Good.
- Bauer?

35:56.315 --> 35:57.748
Five minutes.

36:00.853 --> 36:01.911
Fine.

36:30.115 --> 36:31.946
My name is Jack Bauer.

36:38.791 --> 36:41.191
You'll have to pardon my surprise.

36:41.860 --> 36:43.327
I saw you die.

36:48.333 --> 36:50.597
I watched you enter a building.

36:51.703 --> 36:54.536
Nobody could have survived that explosion.

37:01.880 --> 37:05.839
Our intelligence told us the building
was empty when you entered.

37:25.137 --> 37:26.968
Your fight is with me.

37:27.973 --> 37:29.463
Not my wife...

37:30.175 --> 37:32.507
...not my daughter, but with me.

37:33.846 --> 37:37.213
Please, leave my family alone.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.627
Mr. Drazen...

37:50.762 --> 37:53.788
...you have already lost
your wife and your daughter.

37:54.766 --> 37:57.394
You don't need to lose your sons, too.

37:58.904 --> 38:00.929
My sons are soldiers.

38:01.473 --> 38:04.909
Then they will die for nothing.
We know about the rescue plan.

38:05.177 --> 38:07.805
It was scheduled for 7:20. We stopped it.

38:08.213 --> 38:11.979
We've called in for backup.
If they try again, sir, they will die.

38:12.651 --> 38:15.586
Then you have nothing to worry about.

38:17.756 --> 38:19.485
Call it off, Victor.

38:20.225 --> 38:21.749
How can I?

38:21.860 --> 38:25.091
The same way you've been communicating
with them this entire time!

38:25.197 --> 38:27.629
Call it off or your sons will die!

38:34.940 --> 38:36.999
All right. We'll move him.

38:55.928 --> 38:58.590
Is there another way out of here,
not on the schematic?

38:58.697 --> 39:00.892
- A fire or flood egress?
- Yes.

39:00.999 --> 39:01.988
Good.

39:02.100 --> 39:05.627
- I'll get my men ready.
- Arm them like we did before.

39:14.446 --> 39:15.606
Get up.

39:24.990 --> 39:26.582
We're evacuating the prisoner.

39:26.692 --> 39:29.252
Grab your weapons,
have personnel convene in Quarter C.

39:29.361 --> 39:30.589
Yes, sir.

39:41.673 --> 39:42.731
