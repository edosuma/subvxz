Did she say where she found it?

13:08.570 --> 13:11.529
Oh, I don't know,
some rummage sale, I think.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.836
Anyway, wasn't it just darling
of her to return it? [chuckles]

13:13.880 --> 13:15.098
Yes, darling.

13:15.142 --> 13:17.013
I wonder why
she didn't tell me herself.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.406
Well, when you give her
the chocolates,

13:18.449 --> 13:20.712
do tell her they're
from Belgium, please.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.105
That's the expensive kind.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.672
Come, Duke.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.826
Hello, Bertram.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.262
We need to talk.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.536
They're mementos.

14:01.579 --> 14:03.755
Things that once belonged
to friends.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.279
Patients.

14:05.322 --> 14:06.715
People I've met.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.240
People who are now dead.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.504
If they were alive,
I wouldn't need mementos.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.596
If they're
just harmless keepsakes,

14:18.640 --> 14:20.250
then why do you hide them
in the attic?

14:20.294 --> 14:21.773
You're very emotional.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.210
Well, of course I'm emotional.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.038
I just saw a dead woman.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.822
A dead woman?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.432
Your friend Maisie Moran.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.782
I saw her name on your latest...

14:30.826 --> 14:32.654
souvenir.

14:32.697 --> 14:34.917
So I looked up her address.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.963
I wanted to talk to her.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.748
But it was too late for a chat.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.315
That must be very upsetting
for you.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.316
Let me get you some tea.

14:42.359 --> 14:44.057
I don't want tea.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.623
Bertram, I want answers!

14:48.670 --> 14:50.890
Were you there last night?

14:54.284 --> 14:55.459
Yes.

14:55.503 --> 14:56.939
[sighs]

14:58.985 --> 15:02.640
I'm sure that there is
a perfectly logical explanation

15:02.684 --> 15:03.815
for all of this.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.295
And now would be
a really good time

15:05.339 --> 15:06.818
for you to share that with me.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.429
Because the most
dreadful thoughts

15:08.472 --> 15:09.473
are racing through my mind.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.432
Things that can't possibly
be true.

15:11.475 --> 15:14.914
Please tell me what is going on.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.962
Maisie was very ill.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.138
You're saying that she...

15:22.182 --> 15:24.271
died of natural causes?

15:26.664 --> 15:28.318
Bertram.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.668
What happened last night?

15:31.713 --> 15:33.541
She deserved a beautiful death,

15:33.584 --> 15:35.935
and I made sure she got one.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.807
You made sure?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.374
It's why I was there.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.942
To help her die peacefully.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.641
What do you mean you helped her?

15:46.684 --> 15:48.121
With an injection.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.079
It's the same drug
I use in my practice.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.605
You put her to sleep?

15:54.649 --> 15:56.346
Like she was a dog?

15:56.390 --> 15:58.827
She was on the verge
of so much suffering.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.482
They all were.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.572
They allwere?

16:04.615 --> 16:05.965
Yes, each was dying
of something.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.531
Alcoholism,

16:07.575 --> 16:08.924
heart disease, cancer.

16:10.926 --> 16:13.798
When there's no possibility
of a cure, then...

16:13.842 --> 16:15.670
I bring peace.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.715
You killed all these people?

16:17.759 --> 16:19.152
No, I helped them.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.762
Helped them?

16:21.806 --> 16:22.894
Did...

16:22.938 --> 16:24.418
Did they ask you to?

16:25.854 --> 16:26.811
Well...

16:26.855 --> 16:28.683
Oh, my God.

16:28.726 --> 16:29.727
[hyperventilating]

16:29.771 --> 16:31.729
What's wrong?

16:31.773 --> 16:32.948
I can't breathe.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.471
My heart is pounding.

16:34.515 --> 16:35.951
You need to calm yourself.

16:35.995 --> 16:36.952
Let me get you a sedative.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.040
Don't you come near me!

16:38.084 --> 16:40.390
No. Don't. [whimpers]

16:40.434 --> 16:42.044
Alma, surely you don't think...

16:42.088 --> 16:43.176
-You stay back. Back!
-Alma.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.786
-Get away. Ah!
-Darling.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.570
-[screaming]
-Alma.

16:47.615 --> 16:48.877
[panting]

16:48.920 --> 16:50.009
Alma.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.620
Look, I-I know
you've had a shock.

16:52.663 --> 16:55.579
But... there's really no need
to overreact.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.320
You kill people for a hobby!

16:57.364 --> 17:00.149
It's not possible to overreact!

17:00.193 --> 17:02.499
Hobby? No.

17:02.543 --> 17:03.761
You don't understand.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.721
Those sweet souls, the...

17:06.764 --> 17:09.985
the ones I helped,
they were alone

17:10.029 --> 17:11.508
and scared,

17:11.552 --> 17:13.902
with nothing to look forward to

17:13.945 --> 17:16.078
but unimaginable pain.

17:16.122 --> 17:19.212
I eased them out of life
to protect them.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.737
I showed them mercy.

17:23.781 --> 17:26.262
The first person I helped
in this way, she...

17:28.134 --> 17:29.526
She asked me to.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.008
She begged me.

17:35.793 --> 17:38.144
You should have seen
her face afterwards.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.671
Oh, it was so peaceful.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.893
Ever since then,
it's become my calling.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.682
Alma, are you listening to me?

17:56.292 --> 17:58.164
[trash can clattering]

18:04.344 --> 18:05.780
What?

18:05.823 --> 18:08.522
You've never conducted
a fire safety drill before?

18:17.444 --> 18:18.880
Darling, please.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.316
Can we talk about this?

18:20.360 --> 18:21.709
[door opens]

18:23.798 --> 18:24.929
-Alma?
-No.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.888
Don't come any closer!

18:26.931 --> 18:28.629
Where are you going?

18:28.672 --> 18:30.544
Where do you think I'm going?
To the police!

18:30.587 --> 18:32.198
Can't we talk about this?

18:32.241 --> 18:33.721
You know I'd never hurt you.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.201
I'm not afraid you'll hurt me.

18:35.244 --> 18:36.680
I'm afraid you'll helpme.

18:36.724 --> 18:39.118
-No. No. [screams]
-Alma...

18:39.161 --> 18:40.945
[panting]

18:42.208 --> 18:43.252
Back up.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.471
Get back.

18:48.388 --> 18:51.173
-Alma?
-[Alma groans]

18:51.217 --> 18:52.696
[car door closes, engine starts]

19:04.752 --> 19:07.276
Scooter, I've been thinking.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.018
How'd you like
to come live with me?

19:10.061 --> 19:12.368
You mean shack up?

19:12.412 --> 19:13.935
Well, what about Carlo?

19:13.978 --> 19:17.199
His bitch of a daughter is
taking him back home to Texas.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.461
Oh, swell.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.984
When should I start packing?

19:20.028 --> 19:21.856
Today, if you'd like.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.641
But since I'm still married,

19:24.685 --> 19:26.774
we'll need a cover story
to explain you being there.

19:26.817 --> 19:27.992
Oh, right.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.908
So we don't scandalize
the Garden Club.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.301
[chuckles] Exactly.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.738
So we'll tell people
you're my chauffeur.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.177
-A chauffeur?
-Mm-hmm.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.352
But I'm an actor.

19:39.395 --> 19:40.788
Mm.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.312
Okay, an aspiring actor.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.749
And I'm an aspiring widow.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.795
So while we wait
for our dreams to come true,

19:47.838 --> 19:49.318
you'll stay in my guesthouse.

19:49.362 --> 19:52.234
Trust me, it beats this pigsty.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.584
That woman who cleans for you
isn't just old, she's blind.

19:57.021 --> 19:59.285
I never said
I have a cleaning lady.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.938
[chuckles]

20:00.982 --> 20:02.592
Oh, you must have.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.551
How else could I know about her?

20:08.816 --> 20:10.513
You know what?

20:12.341 --> 20:14.169
Let's leave things how they are.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.563
I want you as my lover,
not my boss.

20:16.606 --> 20:19.043
Oh, for God's sake,
it's temporary.

20:19.087 --> 20:21.742
Carlo is inches from death.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.047
And once I have his money,

20:23.091 --> 20:25.224
we can spend it on anything
you'd like.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.443
Travel, parties.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.750
Give up my freedom
for a few shindigs?

20:29.793 --> 20:30.838
Pasadena.

20:30.881 --> 20:34.624
I will have millions of dollars.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.496
And...

20:36.539 --> 20:39.629
there might even be enough
to finance a film...

20:39.673 --> 20:42.806
starring my former chauffeur.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.244
Are you serious?

20:45.287 --> 20:48.856
Of course I am,
my beautiful boy.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.684
Now, what do you say?

20:50.727 --> 20:52.120
I say...

20:52.163 --> 20:55.297
car's all gassed up,
Mrs. Castillo.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.559
Where to?

20:56.603 --> 20:58.561
Paradise.

20:58.605 --> 20:59.997
And step on it.

21:09.746 --> 21:11.792
Alma Fillcot?

21:11.835 --> 21:13.097
Rita.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.751
What are you doing here?

21:14.795 --> 21:17.580
Oh, I was just around the block,
interviewing a new chauffeur.

21:17.624 --> 21:20.453
Uh, so,
Grace phoned me last night.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.237
She went on and on about you.

21:23.586 --> 21:24.761
She did?

21:24.805 --> 21:27.547
Yes.
She said you were very sweet.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.375
You returned some old trinket?

21:29.418 --> 21:32.116
Yes, her-her cameo.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.206
Anyway, she's very grateful,

21:35.250 --> 21:38.122
and she wants to nominate you
for the open spot in the club.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.473
Oh, my God.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.693
I just didn't think
I'd ever be nominated.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.434
[laughing]

21:45.478 --> 21:46.653
No one did.

21:46.696 --> 21:49.177
But you now have Grace
on your side.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.353
So, good for you.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.921
Do you really think
I have a chance?

21:53.964 --> 21:55.705
Maybe.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.968
Ada Coy was my first choice,
but...

21:59.013 --> 22:00.449
Well, her husband
was just caught

22:00.493 --> 22:02.277
embezzling money from his bank.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.584
Obviously,
we can't admit someone

22:04.627 --> 22:05.802
whose husband might be arrested.

22:07.978 --> 22:09.632
Oh.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.287
Wh-Why not?

22:13.767 --> 22:16.509
The Elysian Park Garden Club
has a sterling reputation.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.642
We can't be associated
with a public scandal.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.035
Right.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.645
That would be awkward.

22:24.430 --> 22:27.824
What if she didn't know
what her husband had done?

22:27.868 --> 22:29.652
Oh. She's his wife.

22:29.696 --> 22:30.871
She should have known.

22:32.916 --> 22:33.874
Poor Ada.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.049
I know.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.094
She'll probably
have to leave town.

22:37.138 --> 22:40.533
No one decent will want to have
a thing to do with her now.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.709
It's not fair.

22:42.752 --> 22:45.712
But the good news is,
now you have a shot.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.104
Someone will call you soon

22:47.148 --> 22:48.802
to set up a date
for your interview.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.281
Oh, and, um,

22:50.325 --> 22:52.588
when that day comes, Alma,

22:52.632 --> 22:54.721
speaking as a friend...

22:54.764 --> 22:56.331
Yes?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.333
Don't wear that.

23:17.613 --> 23:19.876
Are you crazy? You can't
move this kid in here.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.269
Oh. Lots of women have drivers.

23:21.312 --> 23:22.836
Middle-aged men with a gut.

23:22.879 --> 23:25.404
If you move a gorgeous young kid
in here, people will talk.

23:26.796 --> 23:29.190
Well, I'll just... I'll tell
everyone he's an actor

23:29.233 --> 23:31.279
and I'm only moving him in
so I can mentor him.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.541
People won't talk then.

23:32.585 --> 23:33.542
No, they'll laugh.

23:33.586 --> 23:34.543
[doorbell rings]

23:34.587 --> 23:35.805
That must be Scooter now.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.067
His name is Scooter?

23:37.111 --> 23:38.460
[sighs]
I know.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.462
I begged him to change it.

23:45.467 --> 23:46.773
Catherine?

23:46.816 --> 23:48.209
What are you doing here?

23:48.252 --> 23:49.993
Oh, I brought you a present.

23:50.037 --> 23:51.604
Your husband.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.693
Come on, Papa.

23:53.736 --> 23:55.477
Home sweet home.

23:55.521 --> 23:58.741
But you said he was going
to live with you in Texas.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.613
And when I saw how happy
that made you,

24:00.656 --> 24:02.310
I knew I'd made a mistake.

24:02.353 --> 24:04.617
Then it occurred to me
that I can live here,

24:04.660 --> 24:05.748
look after Papa,

24:05.792 --> 24:07.750
and keep an eye on you, as well.

waiting in the wings?

25:35.534 --> 25:36.883
Hmm.

I can't believe
you just did that.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.325
Did what?

25:44.368 --> 25:46.327
You tipped him a whole dollar.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.590
If that's how you're spending
Papa's money,

25:48.634 --> 25:50.287
it's a good thing I'm here.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.246
[scoffs] What I spend
is none of your business.

25:52.289 --> 25:55.815
Oh, but everything you do
is my business now.

25:55.858 --> 25:58.426
Morally and legally.

25:58.469 --> 26:01.995
And if I find legal grounds to
sue for divorce on his behalf,

26:02.038 --> 26:03.736
I will do so.

26:03.779 --> 26:06.347
And take you out of his will.

26:06.390 --> 26:07.914

26:07.957 --> 26:10.177
So that's your plan?

26:10.220 --> 26:12.875
To inherit
the whole shebang yourself?

26:12.919 --> 26:15.530
I don't need Papa's money.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.446
But I sure would love
to take it away from you.

Oh, it's Carlo's daughter.

26:29.849 --> 26:31.502
She brought the S.O.B. home.

to be here?
-Who knows?

We'll talk about it tonight

-Wait.

What about my garment bag?

26:38.161 --> 26:39.119
Mr. Scotty.

26:44.167 --> 26:45.778
Thanks so much.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.867
A-And it-it's Scooter.

26:47.910 --> 26:50.043
You should really think about
"Scotty." It's better.

27:11.325 --> 27:12.892
Mom.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.024
What are you doing here?
I was just about to head home.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.244
Well, then I'm glad
I caught you.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.420
Um...

27:19.463 --> 27:22.118
is there someplace else
that you could go tonight?

27:22.162 --> 27:23.642
A-a friend you could stay with?

27:23.685 --> 27:25.687
I guess. Why?

27:25.731 --> 27:27.558
Well, there's a...

27:27.602 --> 27:28.864
a problem at home

27:28.908 --> 27:30.692
with your father, and I...

27:30.736 --> 27:32.259
it needs to be dealt with.

27:32.302 --> 27:34.348
I just thought it might be
better if we were alone tonight.

27:34.391 --> 27:35.654
What's the matter?

27:35.697 --> 27:36.829
Is Dad sick?

27:36.872 --> 27:38.439
Maybe.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.267
But not in the way
that you mean.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.485
I don't understand.

27:41.529 --> 27:42.704
I can't go into it now.

27:42.748 --> 27:43.923
Not here.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.707

I thought he was. [crying]

Is there another woman?

28:04.117 --> 28:05.727
There was.

So, Daddy...

I'm so sorry.

28:15.389 --> 28:17.696
If I do what I should, then...

28:19.175 --> 28:21.569
I'll lose everything
I've ever dreamed of.

how will I live with myself?
