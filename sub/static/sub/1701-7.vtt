WEBVTT

00:03.128 --> 00:06.171
Okay. What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?

00:06.339 --> 00:09.675
Is there something
repellent about me?

00:10.552 --> 00:11.593
How was the party?

00:11.761 --> 00:15.180
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

00:16.181 --> 00:18.308
So, what is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?

00:18.476 --> 00:21.603
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.605
I go through the exact same thing.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.817
Every time I put on a little weight,
I question everything.

00:29.654 --> 00:30.988
Whoa, whoa.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.323
I've put on a little weight?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.993
- Did you want to?
- Yeah, uh...

00:37.829 --> 00:41.248
No, not weight. More like insulation.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.711
Chandler, I'm unemployed,
in dire need of a project.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.588
Wanna work out? I can remake you.

00:47.756 --> 00:52.092
Uh, I would, but that might get
in the way of my lying-around time.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.303
- Please?
- Come on, let her do it!

00:55.722 --> 00:57.806
All right. But if we put on spandex...

00:57.974 --> 01:01.018
...and my boobs are bigger than yours,
I'm going home.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.396
Your boobs are fine.
Look, I never should have said anything.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.648
Come here. Come here!

01:08.735 --> 01:11.320
Ooh, can't make hands meet!

02:03.540 --> 02:05.749
Okay! Let's do it.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.672
What?

02:12.173 --> 02:15.592
Nothing. Just never seen
you in little stretchy pants before.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.304
And we're changing.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.654
- Unh!
- Come on, give me five more!

02:35.822 --> 02:38.824
- Ugh. Aah!
- Five more!

02:39.784 --> 02:41.410
Five more and I'll flash you.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.078
One...

02:44.497 --> 02:45.789
...two...

02:47.000 --> 02:48.709
...two and a half.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.504
Just show me one of them.

02:57.385 --> 03:01.680
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.145
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.690
She's insane! The woman is insane.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.610
It's before work, after work,
and during work.

03:14.777 --> 03:18.030
She's got me doing
butt-clenches at my desk.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.240
And now they won't
bring me my mail anymore.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.578
Hey, Pheebs. How'd it go with Scott?

03:24.746 --> 03:28.081
Oh, um, it was nice.
Took him to a romantic restaurant...

03:28.249 --> 03:30.167
...ordered champagne. Nice.

03:30.877 --> 03:34.630
- The guy still won't put out?
- Nope. Zilch. Nothing. Uh-uh.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.882
- Sorry, Pheebs.
- Sorry, Pheebs.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.218
Well, look, I don't mind taking it slow.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.677
I like him a lot.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.972
He's really interesting,
and he's really sweet.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.058
Why won't he give it up?

03:47.310 --> 03:50.562
Maybe he, uh, drives his car
on the other side of the road.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.522
If you know what I mean.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.568
No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.741
- Maybe he's gay.
- Oh!

04:02.909 --> 04:05.744
Um, no, I don't think that's the problem.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.746
We went, um,
dancing the other night...

04:07.914 --> 04:12.334
...and just the way he held me so close
and the way he was looking into my eyes...

04:12.502 --> 04:14.920
...I just definitely felt something.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.547
Yeah, but how much can you
tell from a look?

04:17.714 --> 04:19.675
No, I felt it on my hip. I could tell.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.764
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.685
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand
and smack her with it.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.311
Heh.

04:32.021 --> 04:34.231
Ooh. Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.024
What?

04:37.443 --> 04:39.987
Come on, guys.
I don't care. I have a date tonight.

04:40.154 --> 04:41.655
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You have a date?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.740
Yeah. Monica's setting me up.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.743
Heh, now, what about, uh, Ross and...

04:46.911 --> 04:49.246
What? My whole
insane jealousy thing?

04:49.455 --> 04:51.999
Well, you know,
as much fun as that was...

04:52.250 --> 04:54.418
...I've decided to opt for sanity.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.712
So you're okay about all this?

04:56.879 --> 04:59.131
Oh, yeah, come on! I'm moving on.

04:59.299 --> 05:03.010
He can press her up against
that window as much as he wants.

05:03.219 --> 05:06.972
For all I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.975
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.313
Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow
and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

05:14.480 --> 05:16.231
Only if you say his full name.

05:17.275 --> 05:22.112
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

05:23.865 --> 05:25.741
- All right.
- You're getting a cat?

05:25.908 --> 05:29.036
Actually, we're getting a cat. Heh.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.829
- Together?
- Uh-huh.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.123
- Both of you? Together?
- Yup.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.959
It'll live with Ross half the time
and me half the time.

05:36.127 --> 05:39.546
Oh, well, isn't that just lovely?

05:39.714 --> 05:43.216
Ha, ha. That's something
the two of you will be able to enjoy...

05:43.384 --> 05:46.011
...for a really, really, really long time.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.763
- Hopefully.
- Oh, wow.

05:47.930 --> 05:51.308
Whoa! Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

05:51.476 --> 05:53.977
With a man. Ahem, okay.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.438
You guys have a really, uh, good night...

05:56.606 --> 06:00.650
...and you two have a, uh,
really good cat. Heh.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.407
We're not supposed to
take these when we leave.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.041
I don't know if Monica told you...

06:16.209 --> 06:19.544
...but this the first date I've gone on
since my divorce.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.671
So if I seem a little nervous...

06:21.839 --> 06:23.006
...I am.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.384
How long do cats live?

06:27.345 --> 06:30.430
- I'm sorry?
- Cats. How long do they live?

06:30.598 --> 06:33.600
Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus or something?

06:34.519 --> 06:37.896
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.399
Well, that's just great.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.318
- Um, cheers.
- Mm.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.362
Right. Clink. Heh.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.663
Monica told you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

06:55.540 --> 07:00.752
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry. It's just...

07:00.920 --> 07:04.339
It's this thing.
It's probably not as bad as it sounds...

07:04.507 --> 07:08.301
...but this friend of mine
is getting a cat with his girlfriend.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.429
Oh, that does sound...

07:12.473 --> 07:16.017
- Huh.
- He just started going out with her.

07:16.185 --> 07:19.729
Ahem. Is this guy, uh, an old boyfriend?

07:22.358 --> 07:23.733
Yeah, he wishes.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.488
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.575
Okay, Michael, let's talk about you.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.953
- All right.
- Okay. Okay?

07:35.121 --> 07:36.830
So...

07:38.958 --> 07:41.501
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?

07:43.212 --> 07:46.089
- So I figured it out.
- What?

07:46.340 --> 07:48.508
Why Scott doesn't want
to sleep with me.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.093
I'm not sexy enough.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.638
Heh, Phoebe, that's crazy.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.349
When I first met you,
you know what I said to Chandler?

07:56.517 --> 07:59.853
- Mm-mm.
- I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

08:02.940 --> 08:04.649
Really? That's so sweet.

08:07.278 --> 08:10.906
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.

08:12.033 --> 08:15.827
Look, if you wanna know what the deal is,
you're gonna have to ask him.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.705
You're right. You're right.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.540
Ugh, you are so yum!

08:40.770 --> 08:44.689
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.569
Why can't they get one of those bugs?
One of those fruit flies.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.905
Those things that live for a day.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.115
What are they called?
What are they called?

08:55.034 --> 08:57.369
- Fruit flies?
- Yes!

08:57.703 --> 09:00.038
- Thank you.
- Would you like any dessert?

09:00.206 --> 09:02.666
No! No dessert.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.085
Just the check. Please.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.922
Oh, no. You're not having fun, are you?

09:09.173 --> 09:10.757
No, no, I am.

09:11.008 --> 09:15.762
But only because I've been playing
the movie Diner in my head.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.932
Oh, look at me.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.600
Look at me.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.354
Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.815
All I can think about is Ross...

09:26.983 --> 09:28.900
...and his cat...

09:29.068 --> 09:30.610
...and his Julie.

09:31.696 --> 09:35.323
I just want to get over him.
God, why can't I do that?

09:35.491 --> 09:36.950
Oy.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.996
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

09:41.205 --> 09:43.957
You can't see it because
you haven't had closure...

09:44.125 --> 09:45.166
Aah!

09:45.334 --> 09:46.835
Closure!

09:47.295 --> 09:49.421
That's what it is. That's what I need.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.423
God, you're brilliant!

09:53.384 --> 09:55.844
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

09:57.722 --> 10:01.641
Well, there's no one way
really, it's just...

10:01.892 --> 10:04.978
Whatever it takes so that
you can finally say to him:

10:05.187 --> 10:06.354
"I'm over you."

10:07.773 --> 10:10.358
Over you. That's what it is.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.903
Closure.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.573
Hello? Excuse me?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.743
Excuse me. Hel... Whoo!

10:19.994 --> 10:21.244
- Hang on.
- Hello? Excuse me?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.163
- What?
- Hi. I'm sorry.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.750
I need to borrow your phone
for just one minute.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.085
- I'm talking.
- I see that.

10:29.253 --> 10:33.965
It's one phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.844
Okay, you're being a little weird
about your phone.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.350
All right. Fine.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.644
I'll call you back.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.105
Thank you.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.776
Okay.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.615
Machine.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.910
- Just waiting for the beep.
- Good.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.623
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.376
I'm just calling to say that, um...

11:09.543 --> 11:10.877
...everything's fine.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.296
And I'm really happy for you...

11:13.673 --> 11:15.674
...and your cat.

11:16.175 --> 11:20.261
Who, by the way,
I think you should name Michael.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.475
And you see there,
I'm thinking of names...

11:25.685 --> 11:29.020
...so obviously I am over you.

11:29.313 --> 11:32.399
I am over you.

11:32.650 --> 11:37.821
And that, my friend,
is what they call "closure."

11:47.665 --> 11:50.750
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.422
Monica, it's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.258
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday!

11:59.260 --> 12:01.177
It's God's day.

12:01.971 --> 12:05.098
Ha, hey. If you say stop, then we stop.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.474
Ha, ha, okay.

12:06.642 --> 12:09.853
- Stop.
- No, come on! We can't stop!

12:10.020 --> 12:11.980
We got three more pounds to go!

12:12.148 --> 12:14.983
I am the energy train
and you are on board!

12:25.453 --> 12:26.828
Whoo.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.460
- Hey, Rach.
- Mm.

12:33.627 --> 12:36.379
- Oh. And how was the date?
- Ugh.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.758
Um, I think there was a restaurant.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.926
I know there was wine.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.554
Wow. Well, uh...

12:44.722 --> 12:47.223
Uh, actually, Julie's getting a cab.

12:47.391 --> 12:50.602
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.438
What? Why are you
looking at me like that? Heh.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.024
Ahem, I'm sorry. I don't know, I...

12:56.525 --> 12:58.902
I feel like I had a dream
about you last night...

12:59.069 --> 13:00.445
...but I don't remember.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.490
Okay.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.158
Heh. Oh, oh, oh.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.285
- There they are.
- Ahem.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.330
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.916
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.586
- Huh.
- Oh, I haven't even been home yet.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.588
Do you mind if I check my messages?

13:18.756 --> 13:20.423
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.387
Rach, I got a message from you!

13:31.268 --> 13:33.937
- Who's Michael?
- Oh, my God.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.481
God, Ross, no! Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

13:36.649 --> 13:39.359
Give me the phone! Give me the phone!
Give me the phone!

13:39.527 --> 13:41.236
Give me the...

13:46.784 --> 13:48.743
You're over me?

13:48.911 --> 13:50.703
Oh, God.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.081
- Wha...? You're, uh...
- Oh, God.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.251
- You're over me?
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.504
Oh, my God. Oh...

13:59.672 --> 14:03.216
When...? When were you...

14:03.425 --> 14:05.051
...under me?

14:09.139 --> 14:10.473
Rach.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.308
Rachel, do you?

14:13.018 --> 14:14.894
I mean, were you, uh...?

14:15.062 --> 14:17.564
- Ugh. Okay. Okay, okay.
- What?

14:17.731 --> 14:20.567
Well, basically...

14:20.734 --> 14:23.403
...ahem, lately, I've, uh...

14:24.738 --> 14:27.991
Ahem, I've sort of had feelings for you.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.789
You've had feelings for me?

14:34.957 --> 14:37.125
Yeah, so? You had feelings for me first.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.294
Whoa, huh.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.506
You know about my...?
You know I had...?

14:43.674 --> 14:45.508
You know?

14:47.344 --> 14:48.887
- Chandler told me.
- When did he...?

14:49.054 --> 14:50.930
When did he...? When did he?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.518
- When you were in China.
- China.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.645
- Meeting Julie.
- Julie.

14:57.813 --> 15:00.607
Julie. That's... Oh, God.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.067
Julie? Julie, right.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.570
Okay, I need to lie down.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.073
- No, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand...
- Okay.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.076
...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.745
Okay, so you, uh?

15:13.913 --> 15:16.372
And now, what? Now...? Now.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.207
Now you're over me?

15:20.711 --> 15:22.420
Are you over me?

15:31.764 --> 15:36.184
That's... That's Julie. That's Julie. Julie.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.937
- Hi, Julie.
- Honey, I've got a cab waiting.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.980
I'll be right down!

15:45.110 --> 15:46.569
Wait, so you're going?

15:46.737 --> 15:50.490
Well, okay, I, uh... I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.909
I mean, I've, uh... Heh.
You know, I've got a cab.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.371
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.332
Okay. Okay.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.668
Cat!

16:18.727 --> 16:20.728
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

16:22.564 --> 16:25.608
How come you're watching
a rabbi play electric guitar?

16:27.111 --> 16:29.153
I can't find the remote.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.367
Ugh, thank you. Heh.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.996
So, Scott asked me to come over
for lunch and I did.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.999
- And?
- And we did.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.502
- All right, Pheebs! Way to go!
- Yay, me. Ha, ha.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.171
So how did it happen?

16:47.339 --> 16:50.174
I took your advice and
asked him what was going on.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.676
What did he say?

16:51.844 --> 16:56.222
He said he understands how sex can be
a very emotional thing for a woman.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.308
And he was just afraid
that I was going to get all, you know:

16:59.476 --> 17:02.562
"Is he gonna call me the next day?"
And "Where is this going?" and:

17:04.314 --> 17:09.152
So he said he wanted to hold off
until he was prepared to be serious.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.154
- Wow.
- Yeah.

17:11.320 --> 17:15.657
So I said, "Okay. Relax, please."
You know?

17:16.117 --> 17:20.663
I mean, sex can be just about two people
right there in the moment.

17:20.830 --> 17:24.834
If he wants to see me again,
he can call. If not, that's fine too.

17:25.002 --> 17:28.921
So after a lot of talking, heh...

17:30.632 --> 17:32.550
...I convinced him. Heh!

17:36.346 --> 17:38.014
Let me get this straight.

17:38.182 --> 17:41.267
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

17:41.435 --> 17:44.062
He got you to say
he never has to call you again.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.941
And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.736
Uh-huh.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.281
This man is my god.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.467
- Hi.
- I didn't get a cat.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.597
Oh, that's, um, interesting.

18:19.765 --> 18:23.643
No. No, it's not interesting.
Okay? It's very, very not interesting.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.896
It's actually a hundred percent
the opposite of interesting.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.397
I got it, Ross.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.234
You had no right to tell me
you had feelings for me.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.528
- What?
- I was doing great with Julie...

18:33.695 --> 18:35.196
...before I found out about you.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.532
I was doing great before
I found out about you!

18:37.699 --> 18:39.951
You think it's easy for me
to see you with Julie?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.203
You should've said something
before I met her.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.706
I didn't know then. And how come
you never said anything to me?

18:45.874 --> 18:47.458
There was never a good time.

18:47.626 --> 18:51.045
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!

18:51.213 --> 18:53.172
Not... Not... Not...

18:53.340 --> 18:54.757
...every night.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.137
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.055
You know, like Italian guys...

19:01.223 --> 19:04.725
...or ex-fiancés, or... Or... Or...

19:04.893 --> 19:07.228
Italian guys.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.567
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?

19:12.818 --> 19:15.653
The point is, I don't need this right now!

19:15.821 --> 19:17.613
Okay? It's too late.

19:17.781 --> 19:20.741
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy. This ship has sailed!

19:20.909 --> 19:24.162
You're just gonna put away feelings
or whatever it was you felt for me?

19:24.329 --> 19:26.998
I've done it since ninth grade.
I've gotten good at it.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.667
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that, Ross.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.210
I don't need your stupid ship!

19:31.378 --> 19:33.212
- Good.
- Good!

19:33.964 --> 19:36.257
And you know what? Now I got closure!

20:29.561 --> 20:31.103
Try the bottom one.

21:00.133 --> 21:03.511
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.430
We're not working out. It's over.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.350
No way! With one pound to go?
Come on!

21:09.518 --> 21:13.312
We're workin', we're movin'
We're in the zone, we're groovin'

21:14.481 --> 21:16.232
Okay, I don't mind the last pound.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.318
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.322
So don't make me do anything
that I'll regret.

21:23.490 --> 21:27.410
Ha, oh, what you gonna do, fat boy, huh?
Ha, ha.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.120
What? Heh.

21:30.706 --> 21:35.167
Nothing. Except tell you, uh, it's
wonderful how much energy you have.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.295
Well, thanks.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.965
Especially considering how tough
it's been for you to find work.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.551
Well, you know. Heh.

21:43.719 --> 21:44.844
You know, I mean...

21:45.012 --> 21:50.099
...you can't tell your parents you were fired,
because they'd be disappointed.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.601
Uh-huh.

21:52.769 --> 21:56.439
It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.443
- Well, no. But I...
- I mean...

22:00.610 --> 22:03.946
...if it were me, I'd have difficulty
getting out of bed at all.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.747
You know, I try to stay positive.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.665
So you?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.752
You feel like going for a run?

22:20.547 --> 22:22.131
All right.

22:22.299 --> 22:27.428
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.639
Okay.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.268
- Just for a little while.
- Okay.
