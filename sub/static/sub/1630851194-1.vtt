00:02.181 --> 00:03.584
What is comedy?

00:03.618 --> 00:04.786
I'm just kidding.

00:04.820 --> 00:07.024
What have I really began
the show like that?

00:08.460 --> 00:12.468
Hi, I'm BJ Novak,
I am so excited to welcome

00:12.502 --> 00:15.608
you to my television
show, its called The Premise.

00:15.642 --> 00:17.612
Every episode is different,
different cast,

00:17.646 --> 00:19.315
different story.

00:19.348 --> 00:20.518
Here we go.

00:20.552 --> 00:21.319
[music playing]

00:21.352 --> 00:23.658
Ethan Streiber is
the kind of guy

00:23.691 --> 00:26.462
who would do anything
to be an ally.

00:26.497 --> 00:28.501
He's about to find out
what anything means.

00:28.534 --> 00:32.341
This is social justice sex tape.

00:34.345 --> 00:37.652
[music playing]

00:46.837 --> 00:48.507
I didn't do anything
you were there.

00:48.541 --> 00:50.712
What did I do?

00:50.745 --> 00:51.580
I didn't do anything.

00:51.614 --> 00:52.682
Hey!

00:52.782 --> 00:54.051
[car door slams]

00:54.418 --> 00:55.387
[music playing]

00:55.420 --> 00:57.258
This is an injustice.

00:57.291 --> 01:01.099
You watched the season
finale without me?

01:01.132 --> 01:02.067
OK.

01:02.101 --> 01:03.537
Well, obviously I have
a lot of work second

01:03.571 --> 01:04.740
your associate gets
everybody's bitch work.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.342
Hey, gunner.

01:06.376 --> 01:07.378
Thank you.

01:07.612 --> 01:08.581
OK.

01:08.614 --> 01:09.816
Well, when Rayna gives
me one of my own cases

01:09.850 --> 01:11.687
you won't see me for months.

01:35.602 --> 01:40.444
Oh, it makes me deeply,
deeply happy to be

01:40.477 --> 01:42.849
talking to donors like you.

01:42.882 --> 01:43.884
I mean, my favorite
part of my job

01:43.918 --> 01:45.120
is actually talking to donors.

01:45.153 --> 01:45.855
Are you kidding me?

01:45.888 --> 01:46.557
Oh, you know what?

01:46.590 --> 01:47.726
I'm so sorry.
I got to go.

01:47.759 --> 01:50.798
Stacey Abrams has actually
just walked into my office.

01:50.832 --> 01:51.800
Yes.

01:51.834 --> 01:53.771
The real Stacey Abrams,
can you believe it?

01:53.804 --> 01:55.340
I'll tell her you said hi.

01:55.374 --> 01:56.610
OK.

01:56.644 --> 01:57.612
Bye.

01:57.646 --> 01:59.281
Getting your salary gunner.

01:59.315 --> 02:00.450
What's up?

02:00.484 --> 02:02.622
Do you remember the Darren
Williams arrest in Bed‐Stuy?

02:02.656 --> 02:05.227
Charged with aggravated
assault, he says the cop tripped

02:05.260 --> 02:05.895
and fell on his own.

02:05.928 --> 02:06.764
Body cams were off‐‐

02:06.797 --> 02:07.732
Yes, I'm familiar.

02:07.766 --> 02:08.768
Why?

02:13.410 --> 02:15.915
What am I looking at?

02:15.948 --> 02:17.686
Wait a second, is that‐‐

02:17.719 --> 02:18.486
I know.

02:18.521 --> 02:19.322
Is that‐‐

02:19.355 --> 02:20.090
Yup.

02:20.123 --> 02:21.927
‐A sex tape?
‐Darren Williams.

02:21.960 --> 02:25.400
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

02:25.434 --> 02:27.304
I was referring to the context.

02:27.338 --> 02:29.175
Who's handling this case?

02:29.208 --> 02:30.277
A public defender.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.314
All right.

02:32.348 --> 02:34.185
For now.

02:34.218 --> 02:35.588
[laughter]

02:35.621 --> 02:36.456
We have to take this case.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.291
Oh, God.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.226
No, no, no, no, no, here.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.496
I wish we could take
all the cases, I do.

02:39.529 --> 02:42.334
But for every case that we take,
there's the ones that we don't.

02:42.368 --> 02:43.838
And do you seriously
want to go up

02:43.871 --> 02:47.177
against the cops with a sex
tape and a defendant that

02:47.211 --> 02:48.446
has a record?

02:48.480 --> 02:50.685
You have 1,000 emails fighting
for your attention, why would

02:50.718 --> 02:52.922
you want to lose on this one?

02:52.956 --> 02:56.429
We no longer have the freedom
of having nothing to lose, OK?

02:56.462 --> 02:58.634
Our reputation is our power.

02:58.667 --> 03:02.709
Rayna, in my gut I know
that this is important.

03:03.711 --> 03:05.915
I know there's been cases
I've pushed in the past but

03:05.948 --> 03:08.186
this one is different.
I know we can win.

03:08.687 --> 03:09.990
OK.

03:10.023 --> 03:10.858
Fine.

03:10.892 --> 03:12.294
You think this is
important then you

03:12.327 --> 03:13.463
go ahead and see what's there.

03:13.497 --> 03:18.473
And if there is, first chair.

03:18.507 --> 03:19.576
OK.

03:19.609 --> 03:20.878
Yeah?

03:20.912 --> 03:21.714
I got this.

03:21.747 --> 03:22.916
You got this?

03:22.949 --> 03:26.389
I'm going to take this tape
and get Darren Williams off.

03:27.391 --> 03:29.228
That came out wrong, didn't it?

03:29.261 --> 03:29.896
Get out of here.

03:33.804 --> 03:39.014
Mr. Williams, my name is Eve
stone, I'm a lawyer at CRA.

03:39.048 --> 03:40.685
We're a non‐profit
law firm and I'm

03:40.718 --> 03:42.789
interested in taking your case.

03:42.822 --> 03:47.431
I've been here for
like three months... why?

03:51.974 --> 03:55.414
Apparently there's a tape.

03:55.447 --> 03:56.950
Like a security cam?

03:56.984 --> 03:57.852
Not exactly.

04:01.693 --> 04:02.862
Is this you?

04:02.896 --> 04:03.764
No.

04:03.798 --> 04:04.432
Wha‐‐ What's wrong with you?

04:04.465 --> 04:05.400
Why would you show me that?

04:05.434 --> 04:06.102
I'm sorry.

04:06.135 --> 04:09.843
Obviously I'm so sorry that‐‐

04:09.876 --> 04:12.448
this part is this you?

04:16.355 --> 04:17.257
Is that you?

04:19.763 --> 04:21.867
Yeah.

04:21.900 --> 04:22.735
That's me.

04:26.075 --> 04:29.649
Your lawyer told me
you're planning to plead.

04:29.683 --> 04:31.854
I think we can
take this to trial.

04:33.824 --> 04:36.563
I'm a father facing 15.

04:39.101 --> 04:43.042
See they don't make this
shit easy in here at all.

04:43.076 --> 04:46.850
Darren I know that
you're innocent

04:46.884 --> 04:48.888
and I know I can prove it.

04:51.593 --> 04:54.566
Have you done cases
like this before?

04:54.599 --> 04:58.072
I haven't led a trial before.

04:58.106 --> 05:03.584
But there's never been a
trial like this before.

05:03.617 --> 05:05.453
OK.

05:05.487 --> 05:06.389
OK.

05:09.863 --> 05:12.034
Where did you get the tape from?

05:12.969 --> 05:14.606
Hey there, Ethan Streiber.

05:14.639 --> 05:15.842
I don't know if anyone
has announced me.

05:15.875 --> 05:17.612
I'm here to actually
present some evidence.

05:17.645 --> 05:18.479
So‐‐

05:18.514 --> 05:19.816
That is definitely him.

05:19.850 --> 05:20.618
He's here?

05:20.651 --> 05:21.452
‐Yeah.
‐OK.

05:21.485 --> 05:22.421
Hello, hello, hello.

05:22.454 --> 05:23.624
‐Hello.
‐Hey there.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.926
‐Hi, Ethan.
‐Hi.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.997
I'm Eve Stone, and this
is our founding partner

05:27.030 --> 05:27.799
Rayna Bradshaw.

05:27.832 --> 05:28.801
Lovely to meet you.

05:28.834 --> 05:29.836
I know all about your work.

05:29.870 --> 05:30.771
Can I just tell you?

05:30.805 --> 05:32.742
You're as stunning
as you are brilliant.

05:32.775 --> 05:34.111
Oh, thank you.

05:34.144 --> 05:35.013
Thank you.

05:35.046 --> 05:36.750
Come on in and sit down.

05:36.783 --> 05:38.821
So let's start
from the beginning.

05:38.854 --> 05:40.090
Absolutely.

05:40.123 --> 05:42.427
I grew up in Westchester and I
went to college at Middlebury.

05:42.461 --> 05:43.998
I studied creative writing.

05:44.031 --> 05:46.603
I did a bit of acappella with
the premier group on campus.

05:46.637 --> 05:47.639
Ethan, sorry.

05:47.672 --> 05:49.843
I believe she meant the
beginning of the tape.

05:49.876 --> 05:52.114
Where the tape starts.

05:52.147 --> 05:55.688
Duh! I live in Bed‐Stuy which is
a very diverse neighborhood.

05:55.721 --> 05:57.057
Gentrifying very quickly.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.894
Well, not if I can help it.

05:58.928 --> 06:01.432
Um it was a typical day for me.

06:01.465 --> 06:03.102
I was getting home
from a fundraiser

06:03.136 --> 06:05.073
where I heard Evon
Max Kennedy speak

06:05.106 --> 06:06.710
which was so illuminating.

06:06.743 --> 06:08.614
I was really pumped
up so I got to work

06:08.647 --> 06:11.753
amplifying important
voices and causes online.

06:14.593 --> 06:17.397
After a grueling workout,
with a couple of pals.

06:17.431 --> 06:18.968
I feel like I had
earned a little break

06:19.001 --> 06:21.940
so I decided to take
a stroll down memory

06:21.974 --> 06:24.445
lane with one of our
old romantic videos

06:24.478 --> 06:26.015
we made back in March.

06:26.048 --> 06:27.217
Sex‐‐

06:27.251 --> 06:29.589
And the romantic video is filmed
at the exact date and time

06:29.623 --> 06:31.125
of the Darren Williams arrest?

06:31.158 --> 06:31.927
Exactly.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.131
Who is my slam piece?

06:34.164 --> 06:35.735
That's you baby.

06:35.768 --> 06:37.772
[indistinct noises]

06:45.588 --> 06:46.623
Holy shit.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.727
Holy shit.

06:48.761 --> 06:49.963
Fuck.

06:49.996 --> 06:51.700
And that is when you
reached out to us?

06:51.733 --> 06:52.969
Yes.

06:53.002 --> 06:54.739
As soon as I finished watching
the tape I reached right out.

06:54.773 --> 06:56.810
So when you finished?

06:56.843 --> 06:59.749
And so I sent you the two
screenshots which are basically

06:59.783 --> 07:01.653
Exhibit A, Exhibit
B. They completely

07:01.687 --> 07:02.956
exonerate Darren Williams.

07:02.989 --> 07:06.630
Show those things, boom
case fucking closed.

07:06.663 --> 07:07.565
W‐‐ Not exactly.

07:07.599 --> 07:09.101
I know.

07:09.134 --> 07:12.040
I believe we're going to need
to see the video in full.

07:12.074 --> 07:15.213
Yeah, for context.

07:15.246 --> 07:16.984
Yeah, yeah.

07:17.017 --> 07:18.621
That's no big deal.

07:18.654 --> 07:19.990
Sure.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.560
It's right on there.

07:21.593 --> 07:22.562
Thank you.

07:22.595 --> 07:23.664
We can just airplay it.

07:23.697 --> 07:24.499
OK.

07:24.532 --> 07:25.000
[audio playback]

07:25.033 --> 07:26.870
That's it.

07:26.903 --> 07:29.643
Have you agreed
to do this babe?

07:29.676 --> 07:31.813
‐Put on some music?
‐Sure.

07:31.847 --> 07:35.186
[music playing]

07:38.527 --> 07:40.163
You want it in there?

07:40.196 --> 07:41.566
‐Oh, yeah.
‐Yeah?

07:41.600 --> 07:45.541
Just give me a couple
of miuntes here.

07:45.574 --> 07:46.242
[end playback]

07:46.275 --> 07:47.044
Wow.

07:47.077 --> 07:49.883
Oh, goodness.

07:49.916 --> 07:53.590
I'm sorry is that a
lower back tattoo.

07:53.624 --> 07:54.826
And what does that say?

07:54.859 --> 07:55.695
Fat.

07:55.728 --> 07:57.999
It says fate.

07:58.032 --> 07:59.101
Oh, that's nice.

07:59.134 --> 07:59.769
Thanks.

07:59.803 --> 08:01.105
It's the Fresh Prince photo.

08:01.138 --> 08:02.775
Fuck yeah.

08:02.809 --> 08:04.579
Can we maybe just
close the blinds first?

08:04.612 --> 08:05.815
Oh, there it is.

08:05.848 --> 08:08.520
Is that it?

08:08.554 --> 08:09.656
OK.

08:09.689 --> 08:11.660
Look.

08:11.693 --> 08:14.566
He trips and falls and
Darren's hands are still up.

08:14.599 --> 08:16.937
This destroys cops the
entire narrative.

08:16.970 --> 08:19.542
This makes the case.

08:19.576 --> 08:20.076
This is it.

08:20.110 --> 08:22.615
This is amazing.

08:22.648 --> 08:24.619
Wow, OK. Um.

08:24.652 --> 08:25.888
So. so sorry.

08:25.921 --> 08:27.859
Just for some
clarity here, is this

08:27.892 --> 08:29.696
going to be shown in court?

08:29.729 --> 08:31.198
This video, like open court?

08:31.232 --> 08:33.302
Oh, but don't worry, no.

08:33.336 --> 08:34.606
People have seen worse.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.508
Seriously.

08:35.541 --> 08:37.077
They see dead bodies,
maimed bodies‐‐

08:37.110 --> 08:38.012
Oh.

08:38.046 --> 08:38.680
Oh, rats.

08:38.714 --> 08:40.016
I just remembered something.

08:40.050 --> 08:41.787
You know how badly
I want to help

08:41.820 --> 08:44.926
but I don't have Vanessa's
consent to show this video.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.530
And she and I actually broke up.

08:46.563 --> 08:48.266
I don't think it's fair
to trigger her by bringing

08:48.299 --> 08:49.301
this all up again and‐‐

08:49.334 --> 08:51.072
I totally understand.

08:51.105 --> 08:52.140
I will call her for you.

08:52.174 --> 08:54.278
[screams]

08:54.311 --> 08:55.681
Yeah, yeah.

08:55.715 --> 08:56.783
Handled.

08:59.556 --> 09:02.260
[audio playback]

09:02.294 --> 09:05.266
Who is my slam piece?

09:05.300 --> 09:07.070
It's you baby.

09:07.104 --> 09:08.039
Yeah, do you like that?

09:08.072 --> 09:09.208
It's just sex, right?

09:09.241 --> 09:10.343
It's just the
birds and the bees.

09:10.376 --> 09:11.680
Do you know what I mean?

09:11.713 --> 09:12.815
It's funny.

09:12.849 --> 09:16.122
Porn gives people such a
distorted mental image of sex.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.292
Right.

09:18.326 --> 09:20.698
This is what it's
supposed to look like.

09:20.731 --> 09:23.035
Sure.

09:23.069 --> 09:23.937
She's in.

09:23.971 --> 09:25.273
Oh, fantastic.

09:25.306 --> 09:26.208
Great.

09:26.242 --> 09:26.877
OK.

09:26.910 --> 09:28.146
‐Contact him for us.
‐OK.

09:28.179 --> 09:31.853
Hey, maybe we could just play
devil's advocate for a second.

09:31.887 --> 09:35.160
Darren Williams, he's a bit
of a complicated guy, right?

09:35.193 --> 09:37.030
I mean, he's got
a criminal record?

09:37.063 --> 09:40.069
Well, you know he's an
activist and lots of activists

09:40.103 --> 09:41.172
have criminal records.

09:41.205 --> 09:42.274
Yeah.

09:42.307 --> 09:43.142
No, no, no, I have absolutely
zero issue with it.

09:43.176 --> 09:44.011
I think it's great
to have a record.

09:44.044 --> 09:46.015
I ultimately wish
that I had a record.

09:46.048 --> 09:47.117
But I think‐‐

09:47.150 --> 09:48.854
I'm just wondering what the
jury will think of that.

09:48.887 --> 09:50.791
Oh, you don't have
to worry about that.

09:50.825 --> 09:53.096
We leave that to Eve.

09:53.129 --> 09:55.835
Here's the thing,
I can't believe

09:55.868 --> 09:57.137
I'm even going to say this.

09:57.170 --> 09:59.742
But everything I've
been seeing on the news

09:59.776 --> 10:00.778
I don't know that this
is even going to make

10:00.811 --> 10:02.314
that big of a difference.

10:02.347 --> 10:05.253
I mean, do we even really
trust the legal system here

10:05.286 --> 10:07.190
in this messed up
racist country?

10:07.224 --> 10:11.232
I mean, it's saddening to say
but maybe Malcolm was right.

10:11.265 --> 10:14.004
Maybe the system
is beyond saving.

10:14.037 --> 10:15.373
Did Malcolm say that?

10:15.406 --> 10:19.081
I've dedicated my entire
life to the opposite belief.

10:19.114 --> 10:22.722
Even what happened to
anything for the cause.

10:22.755 --> 10:27.230
Look I protest, I donate,
I march regularly.

10:27.264 --> 10:28.867
Thank you.

10:28.901 --> 10:30.236
I really believe in my bones
that Black lives matter.

10:30.270 --> 10:31.272
They do.

10:31.305 --> 10:34.913
It's just so much more
than anything honestly.

10:39.121 --> 10:40.023
But‐‐

10:43.062 --> 10:46.937
Ethan, I know you want
to make a difference

10:46.970 --> 10:50.845
and maybe this isn't
how you imagined it.

10:50.878 --> 10:53.984
But this is your
chance to be a hero.

10:54.017 --> 10:57.257
This is your chance to make a
difference, a big difference

10:57.290 --> 10:59.394
in a man's life.

10:59.428 --> 11:05.306
Ethan, this is your shot.

11:05.340 --> 11:09.649
And Ethan, you are not
throwing away your shot.

11:10.450 --> 11:14.057
I'm not throwing away my shot.

11:14.091 --> 11:14.959
I'll do it.

11:14.993 --> 11:16.262
OK.

11:16.295 --> 11:17.197
Bravo.

11:27.484 --> 11:28.854
We love you, Darren.

11:37.103 --> 11:38.974
Hey, man I'm so
sorry to bug you.

11:39.007 --> 11:40.443
Um we actually haven't had
a chance to meet yet

11:40.476 --> 11:42.280
but I'm just a huge
fan of your activism.

11:42.314 --> 11:43.149
You actually quote‐‐

11:43.182 --> 11:44.752
All rise.

11:44.786 --> 11:46.823
All right, cool man.
Thanks.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.163
You may be seated.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.503
[gavel being hit]

11:53.537 --> 11:55.841
Court is now in session.

11:55.874 --> 12:00.985
You will hear sworn testimony
from two heroic officers

12:01.018 --> 12:03.924
who survived a brutal
attack by the defendant.

12:03.957 --> 12:08.432
And what will the defense
offer you, a sex tape.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.838
Well, if that is all
that the defense is

12:10.871 --> 12:12.407
going to bring to
the table then we

12:12.440 --> 12:18.452
will be forced to pick
it apart frame by frame.

12:18.486 --> 12:21.526
The prosecution and the
defense agree on one thing,

12:21.559 --> 12:25.300
this case is all
about the evidence.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.337
What you see will shock

12:27.370 --> 12:32.414
you, it will disgust you, but
if you are truly brave enough

12:32.447 --> 12:36.221
to look really
carefully you will see

12:36.255 --> 12:38.326
something equally upsetting.

12:41.298 --> 12:43.035
Injustice.

12:45.541 --> 12:48.880
Ethan, the police report
states that Darren Williams was

12:48.914 --> 12:52.454
on the corner of Wyeth
and Jefferson at 4:10 PM,

12:52.487 --> 12:55.093
can you confirm the
location of your apartment?

12:55.126 --> 12:56.061
Sure.

12:56.095 --> 12:58.567
I live on the corner
of Wyeth and Jefferson

12:58.600 --> 13:00.436
um right above the
world's best bodega.

13:00.470 --> 13:02.575
Now you happen to
have your camera

13:02.608 --> 13:05.848
on recording on that
exact intersection

13:05.881 --> 13:07.417
at that exact time?

13:07.450 --> 13:08.386
Yes.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.895
Please prepare yourselves
for what you're about to see.

13:16.936 --> 13:18.439
[audio playback]

13:18.472 --> 13:22.848
I want you to focus on the
tramp stamp‐‐ time stamp please.

13:22.882 --> 13:25.854
We're in out about three minutes
when the church bells start

13:25.888 --> 13:29.862
to ring and the metadata
confirms that it is 4:00 PM.

13:29.896 --> 13:34.171
We can jump ahead
to 13:32 and pause.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.373
[audio playback]

13:35.406 --> 13:36.910
If you could just
zoom in even more.

13:36.943 --> 13:38.847
Yeah just even deeper,
as deep as possible

13:38.880 --> 13:42.354
on the incident‐‐ on the
police incident please.

13:42.387 --> 13:43.857
Thank you.

13:43.890 --> 13:48.232
We see Darren Williams
4:10 PM on the dot.

13:48.265 --> 13:49.502
Play please.

13:49.535 --> 13:53.209
As you can see two
officers approach Darren

13:53.242 --> 13:57.017
and while his hands are
still clearly raised,

13:57.050 --> 14:01.025
the officer trips shattering
his own elbow contradicting

14:01.058 --> 14:04.431
their own statement that
there was aggravated assault.

14:04.464 --> 14:09.074
Now Ethan, does that look like
my client assaulting somebody

14:09.107 --> 14:10.309
to you?

14:10.343 --> 14:11.445
Hard no.

14:11.478 --> 14:15.053
This tape is
unequivocal evidence

14:15.086 --> 14:18.259
that the police lied
about this incident

14:18.292 --> 14:22.902
and continue to lie
about it to this day.

14:22.935 --> 14:25.139
So Ethan, what led
to your decision

14:25.173 --> 14:27.978
to masturbate to this sex tape?

14:28.012 --> 14:32.053
I guess I was lonely
and I had some work I

14:32.087 --> 14:37.531
was avoiding doing so I was
procrastinating, I guess.

14:37.565 --> 14:41.138
So the woman on the tape
identified as Vanessa Delacorte

14:41.171 --> 14:42.307
is‐‐ um...

14:42.340 --> 14:43.309
well, there's
really no other way

14:43.342 --> 14:45.012
to say this‐‐ much more
attractive than you?

14:45.046 --> 14:45.647
Objection.

14:45.681 --> 14:47.585
Opinion not fact.

14:47.618 --> 14:48.620
Overruled.

14:48.653 --> 14:50.557
I'll allow it as fact.

14:50.591 --> 14:53.195
Had you two had sex before?

14:53.229 --> 14:54.464
Yeah, obviously.

14:54.499 --> 14:57.638
And she willingly
engaged in that again.

14:57.671 --> 14:58.406
Uh‐huh.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.575
7:47 please.

14:59.609 --> 15:01.445
[audio playback]

15:01.478 --> 15:04.451
I mean, you can see
he is completely

15:04.484 --> 15:07.558
missing her entire area there.

15:07.591 --> 15:09.629
17:12, zoom in.

15:09.662 --> 15:10.597
Yes.

15:10.631 --> 15:12.635
And how old are you Ethan?

15:12.668 --> 15:13.603
Twenty nine.

15:13.637 --> 15:16.576
Twenty nine years old.

15:16.609 --> 15:20.617
And yet that is clearly the
scrotum of a much older man.

15:20.651 --> 15:24.124
Left testicle almost twice the
size of the right testicle.

15:24.157 --> 15:28.032
It's just really‐‐ it's
just not adding up, is it?

15:28.065 --> 15:29.702
Now you have a lot
of Black friends,

15:29.735 --> 15:31.205
don't you Mr. Streiber?

15:31.238 --> 15:31.940
Yeah, of course.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.075
A ton.

15:33.109 --> 15:35.547
Well, is it possible that
the man in the purple hoodie

15:35.581 --> 15:40.423
could be one of your friends,
perhaps a fellow crisis actor?

15:40.456 --> 15:42.127
Crisis actor?

15:42.160 --> 15:46.301
Finally, tell us Ethan, what
is the name of the folder

15:46.335 --> 15:48.239
that you keep this video in?

15:48.272 --> 15:49.709
Unreal.

15:49.742 --> 15:53.182
And what is the connection
of the content of Unreal?

15:53.215 --> 15:56.155
That's album in my phone
where I keep all my‐‐

15:56.188 --> 15:58.560
everybody's got that
place where they keep

15:58.593 --> 16:01.365
all the stuff that gets you‐‐

16:01.398 --> 16:02.367
Fantasies?

16:02.400 --> 16:03.235
Yeah, yeah.

16:03.269 --> 16:04.337
Exactly.

16:04.371 --> 16:09.014
That maybe never happened,
that are maybe unreal‐‐

16:09.047 --> 16:10.751
Are they going to believe
this video was fake?

16:10.784 --> 16:12.453
‐‐which is more likely?

16:12.487 --> 16:15.994
A man who looks like this
who had sex with a woman who

16:16.028 --> 16:19.100
looks like that in
the most profoundly

16:19.134 --> 16:25.046
bizarre manner or a millennial
incel who is so desperate to be

16:25.079 --> 16:29.722
a hero to his progressive peers
that he might have fabricated

16:29.755 --> 16:38.172
a deepfake that is exactly
what he says it is, Unreal?

16:38.205 --> 16:40.376
So here's how we're going
to bring Darren home,

16:40.409 --> 16:42.581
we're going to open up your
entire phone for everybody

16:42.615 --> 16:44.017
to see.

16:44.050 --> 16:45.687
Every picture, every
video, everything

16:45.721 --> 16:47.023
you've ever searched.

16:47.056 --> 16:48.560
We're going to
call on your exes.

16:48.593 --> 16:51.365
That's how we're going to paint
a complete picture of Ethan

16:51.398 --> 16:52.333
Streiber.

16:52.367 --> 16:53.637
No, no. no.
I'm just feeling‐‐ I'm sorry.

16:53.670 --> 16:54.337
I'm sorry.

16:54.371 --> 16:55.473
I'm feeling uncomfortable. OK.

16:55.507 --> 16:57.277
I don't like that I've
become this like white Savior

16:57.310 --> 16:58.445
figure in this trial.

16:58.479 --> 16:59.515
I don't think
that's appropriate.

16:59.549 --> 17:02.253
This should be about you ladies
and Darren. Right?

17:02.287 --> 17:05.527
I‐‐ I just don't think that I
should be centered in this

17:05.561 --> 17:09.034
narrative. Okay. I need to
just remove myself. Okay...

17:09.669 --> 17:10.804
Oh, God.

17:10.837 --> 17:12.273
I feel so much better this
is the right move ultimately

17:12.307 --> 17:13.142
I think. You know my

17:13.175 --> 17:14.177
e‐therapist keeps
telling me I need

17:14.211 --> 17:16.114
to listen to the physical
sensations in my body.

17:16.148 --> 17:17.718
So you fantastic
ladies are going

17:17.751 --> 17:19.487
to return to doing
what you're doing best

17:19.522 --> 17:22.393
and I will go back to
doing what I do best‐‐

17:22.427 --> 17:25.099
donating, protesting, marching.

17:25.132 --> 17:27.437
Ethan, no. All right.

17:27.470 --> 17:31.746
We are in too deep
to turn back now, OK?

17:31.779 --> 17:34.384
Either you let us open
up the Unreal folder‐‐

17:34.417 --> 17:38.292
and yeah it's embarrassing‐‐
or Darren Williams goes

17:38.325 --> 17:40.396
to prison for 15 years.

17:40.429 --> 17:42.835
It's time to pick a side Ethan.

17:42.868 --> 17:45.574
Are you with us or not?

18:02.140 --> 18:06.281
[music playing]
I now enter into evidence
the entire contents

18:06.315 --> 18:09.354
of Ethan Streiber's phone.

18:09.387 --> 18:13.095
Please brace yourselves.

18:13.128 --> 18:16.301
I'm now opening
the folder, Unreal.

18:20.476 --> 18:27.256
Let the record show 47
homemade videos and 650 still

18:27.290 --> 18:29.495
images and screenshots,
some dating

18:29.528 --> 18:34.739
back as far as seven years all
establishing a relevant pattern

18:34.772 --> 18:38.613
that the sex you saw on tape
was consistent with his behavior

18:38.647 --> 18:40.517
and proclivities.

18:40.550 --> 18:43.657
I now call to the stand
Vanessa Delacorte, the woman

18:43.690 --> 18:47.130
who appeared in the video.

18:47.163 --> 18:50.737
Please proceed whenever
you're ready Ms. Delacorte.

18:50.771 --> 18:52.574
It's difficult for
me to be here today

18:52.608 --> 18:56.481
and to expose this chapter
of my life to the public.

18:56.516 --> 18:59.522
But I do it to shed light
on an important issue

18:59.555 --> 19:02.393
larger than myself.

19:02.427 --> 19:07.303
How our society gaslights
insecure young women

19:07.337 --> 19:10.409
that they should be with
white men who have nothing

19:10.443 --> 19:15.854
to offer them but unearned
status, privilege,

19:15.887 --> 19:19.194
and arrogance.

19:19.227 --> 19:24.505
I am here today to
tell the world I am not

19:24.538 --> 19:26.174
the woman you saw on that tape.

19:29.682 --> 19:30.817
Not anymore.

19:33.957 --> 19:35.627
Thank you Ms. Delacorte.

19:35.660 --> 19:37.397
Let's just get to it, shall we?

19:37.430 --> 19:39.535
Did Ethan ever make you orgasm?

19:39.568 --> 19:40.704
Never.

19:40.737 --> 19:41.806
And would you be
the type to fake it?

19:41.839 --> 19:43.576
He wouldn't have noticed.

19:43.610 --> 19:46.916
So could the screams on the tape
have been coming from Ethan?

19:46.949 --> 19:51.425
He made more of a grunting sound
like a car that couldn't start.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.765
Would you be so kind as to
demonstrate that for the jury?

19:54.799 --> 19:56.368
It's soon, it's
soon, it's soon‐‐

19:56.401 --> 19:57.538
It's soon, it soon, it soon‐‐

19:57.571 --> 19:58.573
It's soon, it soon, it's soon‐‐

19:58.606 --> 19:59.642
It's soon it's soon it's soon

19:59.675 --> 20:01.612
It's now.

20:01.646 --> 20:03.683
A pattern emerges.

20:03.717 --> 20:04.985
He did this thing with his arms.

20:05.019 --> 20:08.258
This weird thing with his arms.

20:08.292 --> 20:09.427
[audio playback]

20:09.461 --> 20:11.465
A clear pattern.

20:11.499 --> 20:12.768
And what songs did he play?

20:12.801 --> 20:14.437
It was always the same song‐‐

20:14.471 --> 20:15.707
Back That Ass Up.

20:15.741 --> 20:17.711
We rarely made it
past Back That Ass Up.

20:17.745 --> 20:18.747
What did he call you?

20:18.780 --> 20:20.483
He called me slam piece.

20:20.517 --> 20:21.384
Slam piece.

20:21.418 --> 20:21.953
Slam piece.

20:21.986 --> 20:22.888
[audio playback]

20:22.921 --> 20:23.656
This is my slam piece

20:23.690 --> 20:25.025
[end playback]

20:25.059 --> 20:27.430
So a pattern.

20:27.463 --> 20:28.833
I am Ethan's doctor.

20:28.867 --> 20:32.674
He has visited me for many
STD scares over the years.

20:32.708 --> 20:35.413
Most imagined several real.

20:35.446 --> 20:38.520
And yes this indeed
is his real scrotum.

20:38.553 --> 20:41.692
The man on the tape, is
the real Ethan Streiber.

20:41.726 --> 20:44.364
I never forget a
scrotum like that.

20:44.397 --> 20:45.399
Thank you doctor.

20:45.433 --> 20:46.903
No further questions.

20:46.936 --> 20:50.677
Now, you're not a licensed
therapist, is that correct?

20:50.710 --> 20:51.913
Right.

20:51.946 --> 20:54.952
I'm a team member
at your ecouncillor.

20:54.985 --> 20:57.958
And you might have some
insight into Ethan Streiber's

20:57.991 --> 20:58.927
psychology?

20:58.960 --> 21:00.362
Again, I'm a team member.

21:00.396 --> 21:02.768
I handle a lot of people.

21:02.801 --> 21:08.780
Well, I went through more than
10,000 of Mr. Streiber's tweets

21:08.813 --> 21:12.019
and I just want to understand
the psychology and credibility

21:12.053 --> 21:14.057
of that type of individual.

21:14.090 --> 21:16.562
This one calls for
abolishing the police.

21:16.596 --> 21:19.334
This one calls from
our law enforcement

21:19.367 --> 21:20.670
at a Tame Impala show.

21:20.704 --> 21:22.774
Never trust the
government, never

21:22.808 --> 21:26.047
trust the
pharmaceutical industry,

21:26.081 --> 21:28.720
and then the government
is doing an amazing job

21:28.753 --> 21:29.989
rolling out the vaccine.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.059
You're an idiot if
you don't get it.

21:32.093 --> 21:34.330
This one says MJ is
the GOAT, this one

21:34.364 --> 21:35.801
says LeBron is the GOAT.

21:35.834 --> 21:37.771
We can't have two GOATs.

21:37.805 --> 21:40.577
And what do you all
think of this one?

21:40.610 --> 21:44.083
"Maybe more cops will
go to jail if they

21:44.117 --> 21:48.827
didn't put the stupidest
people in America on juries."

21:58.078 --> 22:00.115
I shouldn't of taken this case.

22:00.149 --> 22:02.521
Why did you want
this case so badly?

22:02.554 --> 22:04.357
It‐‐ It just cut through my
inbox.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.426
You know.

22:05.459 --> 22:07.430
There's two types of tapes
that go around, right?

22:07.463 --> 22:09.869
There's the "stop
what you're doing,

22:09.902 --> 22:11.906
you have to watch this video."

22:11.939 --> 22:14.845
And then there's the
"stop what you're doing

22:14.879 --> 22:17.684
you have to watch this video."

22:17.718 --> 22:19.688
I thought the people that
tuned these things out

22:19.722 --> 22:22.393
might pay attention if it was
the kind of ridiculous video

22:22.426 --> 22:24.965
they watch every day.

22:24.999 --> 22:30.510
I had this big ridiculous dream
that I could change things,

22:30.544 --> 22:35.119
that I could make a difference,
and I took this big swing

22:35.152 --> 22:39.662
and now real people are
caught up in my mistake.

22:39.695 --> 22:42.701
The jury just thinks
he's a woke ally

22:42.734 --> 22:46.676
or whatever he's
not even that guy.

22:46.709 --> 22:50.884
I get that you are supposed
to learn from your mistakes

22:50.917 --> 22:56.696
but it is not fair that
people have to pay for mine.

22:56.729 --> 22:59.067
You know what's funny?

22:59.100 --> 23:00.135
No.

23:00.169 --> 23:04.177
The worst this case goes
the more I believe in you.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.181
What does that mean?

23:06.214 --> 23:09.888
I can see your ambition.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.792
I can see your heart.

23:12.961 --> 23:14.531
You know...

23:14.565 --> 23:17.671
Sometimes pressure brings
out who people really are.

23:27.189 --> 23:27.958
I don't think so.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.530
[phone ringing]

23:37.143 --> 23:38.278
What's up dad?

23:38.312 --> 23:42.821
Tom Brady after every game
he reviewed the game tapes.

23:42.854 --> 23:46.061
See what went wrong, what
could have gone better,

23:46.094 --> 23:48.566
look I just want to
say I'm proud of you.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.735
You're going to get better to.

23:49.768 --> 23:51.438
[phone ringing]

23:51.471 --> 23:51.839
Oh, my God.

23:54.878 --> 23:56.114
Oh, my God.

23:56.147 --> 23:58.720
It leaked. Oh shit.

24:01.592 --> 24:03.128
Yo all the porn
sites are shutting down.

24:03.161 --> 24:05.500
There's no one going to trying
to beat their meat to this.

24:05.533 --> 24:07.904
All of a sudden you get
home, hop on p‐hub, they

24:07.938 --> 24:10.844
got the social justice
category right above step up.

24:10.877 --> 24:12.514
I love those guys.

24:12.547 --> 24:14.718
I'm about to make this shit
light up Tik‐Tok right now.

24:14.752 --> 24:16.856
I don't even want to see a dance
move based on the shot.

24:16.889 --> 24:20.497
[music playing]

24:20.530 --> 24:21.131
Fuck.

24:26.909 --> 24:28.646
I got a small penis on how
to plump it like a Reebok.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.915
[laughter]

24:29.948 --> 24:33.155
On the bridge he's like,
Black Lives Matter.

24:33.188 --> 24:34.758
[laughter]

24:34.792 --> 24:35.760
[shouts]

24:37.029 --> 24:42.073
A police incident. A sex tape.
And a highly unusual scrotum.

24:42.106 --> 24:45.714
I'm Michael, this is the daily.

24:55.700 --> 24:58.005
The tape leaked.

24:58.038 --> 24:58.740
Who leaked it?

25:01.679 --> 25:03.048
Your office had it?

25:03.081 --> 25:04.150
Who would leak it?

25:04.183 --> 25:06.555
W‐‐ What the hell this turning
into?

25:06.589 --> 25:08.926
I didn't want to be
a famous case.

25:08.960 --> 25:09.762
Darren.

25:09.795 --> 25:11.899
What?

25:11.932 --> 25:14.571
I need you to trust me on this.

25:14.605 --> 25:16.107
I got this.

25:16.141 --> 25:17.778
Then get it.

25:17.811 --> 25:20.583
How would the defense
like to proceed?

25:20.617 --> 25:22.253
Your Honor, the
defense would like

25:22.286 --> 25:26.562
to recall Ethan Streiber
back to the stand.

25:26.595 --> 25:27.964
What the fuck?

25:27.998 --> 25:30.302
Ms. Stone, you've already
examined this witness.

25:30.335 --> 25:32.239
I know Your Honor
and I would not

25:32.273 --> 25:34.578
do this if it wasn't serious.

25:34.611 --> 25:37.517
The defense believes the witness
may have perjured himself.

25:40.022 --> 25:40.990
Very well.

25:41.024 --> 25:42.661
Are you fucking kidding me?

25:52.748 --> 25:54.150
Ethan do you know
why I've called you

25:54.183 --> 25:56.254
back up to the stand?

25:56.287 --> 25:57.958
There's a pattern
of discrepancies

25:57.991 --> 26:02.233
between who you say you
are and who you really are.

26:02.266 --> 26:04.938
You went to the
women's march and yet

26:04.972 --> 26:07.276
we all saw how you
talked to Vanessa.

26:07.309 --> 26:08.880
I'll strive to do better.

26:08.913 --> 26:11.719
Under oath you said
you had and I quote,

26:11.752 --> 26:13.623
"A ton of Black friends."

26:13.656 --> 26:14.992
Sick.
Yes, I do.

26:15.025 --> 26:16.762
Why would I apologize for that?

26:16.796 --> 26:20.169
Ethan, can you name a single
black friend of yours?

26:20.202 --> 26:20.670
Yeah.

26:20.703 --> 26:23.108
Can I, yes. Um...

26:23.141 --> 26:25.245
Joe.

26:25.279 --> 26:28.051
Joe from my building.

26:28.084 --> 26:30.857
Let's see FM, he's my‐‐

26:30.890 --> 26:32.193
from the fund.

26:32.226 --> 26:34.865
Ethan we have the entire
contents of your phone

26:34.898 --> 26:36.769
entered into evidence.

26:36.802 --> 26:40.844
Would I find either of
those two numbers on there?

26:40.877 --> 26:41.745
I'm sure.

26:41.779 --> 26:43.148
On a group text maybe.

26:45.954 --> 26:46.789
What about you?

26:46.822 --> 26:48.325
You're my friend.

26:48.358 --> 26:49.728
Ethan I'm not your friend.

26:55.339 --> 26:57.076
OK, you know what?

26:57.109 --> 26:57.911
You know what?

26:57.944 --> 26:59.815
All I wanted to do is help.
Okay.

26:59.848 --> 27:00.850
And everybody is just‐‐

27:00.884 --> 27:04.825
everybody is just
making it impossible. Okay.

27:04.858 --> 27:08.733
Everybody is dragging me for
not being a perfect person.

27:08.766 --> 27:11.204
I've really done everything
I can think of to do.

27:11.237 --> 27:13.676
I posted that black square,
I deleted that black square,

27:13.709 --> 27:15.212
I reposted the black
square, and then I

27:15.245 --> 27:16.214
redeleted the black square.

27:16.247 --> 27:19.220
And literally nothing
is ever enough. Okay.

27:19.253 --> 27:21.090
And everyone on
all sides is just

27:21.124 --> 27:23.361
destroying me to show
how good they are.

27:23.395 --> 27:25.700
Well, how am I supposed
to get a job after this?

27:25.733 --> 27:27.169
Hm? You ever thought of that?

27:27.203 --> 27:29.708
How am I ever going
to get a date after this?

27:29.741 --> 27:32.179
Do you realize how deeply
fucked up this is for me.

27:32.213 --> 27:33.114
[gavel being hit]
Language.

27:33.148 --> 27:34.852
No, no, no, no.
This system is fucked up.

27:34.885 --> 27:35.720
You know what? Actually,

27:35.753 --> 27:37.791
actually both
systems are fucked up.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.360
The justice system wants
to fuck people like Darren.

27:39.393 --> 27:41.765
And the social justice system
wants to fuck people like me.

27:41.799 --> 27:42.433
[gavel being hit]

27:42.466 --> 27:43.803
And I'm not perfect.

27:43.836 --> 27:45.305
Did I ever say
that I was perfect?

27:45.339 --> 27:48.245
I am so deeply fucked up in
a myriad of fucked up ways

27:48.278 --> 27:50.817
just like everybody
fucking in this room is.

27:50.850 --> 27:53.188
But I try so hard.

27:53.221 --> 27:55.192
I really try all the time
to do the right thing

27:55.225 --> 27:57.196
but it seems like the
harder I try the more

27:57.229 --> 27:59.000
I just get incessantly shit on.

27:59.033 --> 28:00.803
So forget it.

28:00.837 --> 28:04.277
I quit, it's all over, fuck
this court, fuck this system,

28:04.310 --> 28:05.813
and fuck this woke bullshit.

28:05.847 --> 28:08.051
[gavel being hit]

28:18.906 --> 28:21.979
The defense rests.

28:22.012 --> 28:25.018
Witness dismissed.

28:25.052 --> 28:27.724
It must be nice to be
able to get that man.

28:45.092 --> 28:46.261
Has the jury reached a verdict?

28:49.400 --> 28:53.776
Your Honor, the jury finds
the defendant not guilty.

28:53.809 --> 28:54.176
Yeah.

28:54.210 --> 28:54.978
[shouts]

28:55.012 --> 28:56.247
Yes.

28:56.281 --> 28:56.882
Yes.

29:01.157 --> 29:07.938
[gavel being hit]

29:07.971 --> 29:08.906
Is that what it took?

29:11.512 --> 29:13.916
Y'all wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for that tape.

29:13.950 --> 29:16.354
Is that what it takes?

29:16.387 --> 29:18.224
[laughter]

29:18.258 --> 29:21.297
Is that what it
takes like seriously?

29:21.331 --> 29:26.040
Do these videos have to be
more obscene every time?

29:26.074 --> 29:29.948
More shocking every time?

29:29.982 --> 29:34.791
I just want to take this time
to thank my lawyer Eve Stone,

29:34.825 --> 29:36.361
I want to thank
the judge, I want

29:36.394 --> 29:41.839
to thank the jury, the bailiff,
the stenographer, and Jesus.

29:41.872 --> 29:42.841
I want to thank Jesus‐‐

29:42.874 --> 29:43.509
Sketch?

29:43.542 --> 29:44.911
The sketch artist.

29:44.945 --> 29:46.481
I want to thank‐‐

29:46.515 --> 29:48.986
I want to thank you all for
having to sit through all that.

29:49.020 --> 29:50.455
Wow.

29:50.489 --> 29:54.564
I got to thank my aunt,
she came through everyday‐‐

29:54.598 --> 29:57.036
That's a great speech.

29:57.069 --> 30:00.042
I didn't make it in but‐‐

30:00.075 --> 30:04.317
Ethan, you know he's
grateful to you too.

30:04.350 --> 30:07.489
You said I'd be a hero for this.

30:07.524 --> 30:08.926
I didn't say you'd look like
one.

30:22.252 --> 30:23.421
This is just the beginning.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.425
I'm never going to
forget any of this.

30:25.459 --> 30:28.131
While I have you attention, I
guess it really just comes down

30:28.164 --> 30:29.266
to this.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.204
In the sex tape
that is life always

30:31.237 --> 30:34.276
remember there's probably
somebody getting screwed

30:34.310 --> 30:36.882
even harder out of frame.

30:36.915 --> 30:38.151
Wow.

30:38.184 --> 30:40.022
And not everybody
has a tape like this.

30:40.055 --> 30:43.896
As a matter of fact, not
anybody has a tape like this.

30:43.929 --> 30:46.300
[laughter]

30:46.334 --> 30:47.302
Nicely done.

30:47.336 --> 30:50.610
[music playing]
