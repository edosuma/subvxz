01:18.800 --> 01:21.600
The first hazard
for the returning hero...

01:21.803 --> 01:23.643
is his fame.

01:23.805 --> 01:26.765
The adulation
can spin you quite giddy.

01:26.975 --> 01:30.135
Those who once dismissed you
as a lousy pork chop...

01:30.353 --> 01:33.553
now clamor just to be
in your presence.

01:33.732 --> 01:36.092
Sir! Sir!

01:36.234 --> 01:39.434
- Look, sir, look! Look!
- Up in the sky!

01:39.654 --> 01:41.494
Look up there!

02:06.431 --> 02:09.231
Excuse me. Mr. Hoggett.
Mr. Hoggett, sir.

02:09.434 --> 02:11.874
Mr. Hoggett, sir.
Your pig.

02:12.062 --> 02:14.862
If you'd just hold the pig up
for the press.

02:15.065 --> 02:17.305
Look this way!

02:19.235 --> 02:21.515
- This way! One more!
- Show us the pig!

02:23.198 --> 02:26.118
The deeds of the farmer
and his remarkable pig...

02:26.284 --> 02:28.804
became renowned
even in distant lands.

02:30.955 --> 02:33.315
...find the time to apply
for all these...

02:33.458 --> 02:36.298
Invitations came from all over
to open fairs,

02:36.461 --> 02:38.661
- to demonstrate sheepherding...
- Oh! More?

02:38.797 --> 02:41.797
and, indeed, to meet a queen.

02:41.966 --> 02:45.406
- Ooh.
- But Arthur Hoggett was a retiring man.

02:45.637 --> 02:48.677
He found his best pleasures
working his farm.

02:48.848 --> 02:50.728
I'll need a neighbor to help me.

02:52.352 --> 02:56.752
So it was, one morning he set out
to repair the water pump...

02:56.982 --> 03:00.462
and Babe somehow got it into his head
that he could help.

03:02.278 --> 03:05.398
But fate turns on a moment,
dear ones,

03:05.615 --> 03:10.495
and the pig was about to learn the
meaning of those two cruel words of regret:

03:10.787 --> 03:12.627
"if only".

03:15.959 --> 03:18.119
- If only he hadn't been so careless.
- Whoa!

03:21.965 --> 03:26.685
if only the weight of the pig and the pump
did not exceed the weight of the farmer,

03:26.970 --> 03:30.410
if only the farmer did not connect
with the platform on the way up...

03:30.640 --> 03:33.000
or jam his fingers at the top,

03:35.520 --> 03:38.800
if only the pump
hadn't fallen off at the bottom,

03:40.942 --> 03:44.982
and if only the poor farmer
had the presence of mind...

03:46.197 --> 03:47.997
to hold onto the rope.

03:51.369 --> 03:53.729
Boss?

03:53.872 --> 03:56.192
Boss!

04:42.253 --> 04:45.293
At no other time in his short life...

04:45.465 --> 04:49.185
had the pig wished more that his words
could be understood by humans,

04:49.427 --> 04:52.707
if only to say, "Sorry, Boss".

04:52.931 --> 04:55.051
Sorry, Boss.

04:58.436 --> 05:02.596
Non, rien de rien

05:02.857 --> 05:06.737
Non
je ne regrette rien

05:06.945 --> 05:08.865
Ni le bien

05:08.989 --> 05:11.069
Qu'on m'a fait

05:11.241 --> 05:12.801
Ni le mal

05:12.951 --> 05:15.751
Tout ca m'est bien egal

05:17.288 --> 05:19.048
Non, rien de rien

05:24.462 --> 05:27.262
Even before her Arthur's misfortune,

05:27.465 --> 05:29.785
Mrs. Hoggett was ceaselessly busy...

05:29.968 --> 05:32.568
bustling, baking,
bottling and pickling,

05:32.762 --> 05:36.522
but now, having to nurse her husband
and pay the bills,

05:36.766 --> 05:39.566
she found life
considerably more challenging...

05:39.769 --> 05:41.609
than she had ever anticipated.

05:43.898 --> 05:46.978
Before long, two men showed up.

05:47.152 --> 05:49.792
Two men in suits.

05:49.988 --> 05:53.588
Men with pale faces
and soulless eyes.

05:53.825 --> 05:57.625
Such men could have come
from only one place: the bank.

05:59.831 --> 06:02.071
Arthur!

06:02.208 --> 06:04.568
Arthur!

06:09.007 --> 06:10.847
Where is it? Where is it?

06:11.009 --> 06:13.009
Where is it?

06:13.178 --> 06:15.018
Yes.

06:16.514 --> 06:18.354
"Dear Mr. Arthur Hoggett...

06:18.516 --> 06:21.316
"...guest appearance for your pig.

06:21.519 --> 06:23.839
...sheepherding demonstration".

06:24.022 --> 06:25.862
Sheepherding demonstration?

06:26.024 --> 06:27.864
"Free air travel, accommodations...

06:28.026 --> 06:29.866
and a generous appearance fee".

06:30.028 --> 06:32.708
Oh! Arthur! Arthur!
A generous appearance fee!

06:32.864 --> 06:34.744
Look! See? See?

06:34.866 --> 06:38.466
Pig! Pig!
Pig, pig, pig! Pig!

06:39.829 --> 06:42.109
Pig, pig, pig.
Pig? Pig, pig, pig!

06:43.667 --> 06:45.787
Pig! Pig, pig, pig!

06:45.919 --> 06:48.559
Come, dear.
You're being called.

06:48.713 --> 06:51.633
- Pig!
- Uh, he's not here.

06:51.841 --> 06:54.201
- Pig, pig, pig, pig!
- Babe.

06:56.054 --> 06:57.934
Babe's not here.

06:58.056 --> 07:01.256
You can't undo what's happened, son,
but you can make up for it.

07:01.476 --> 07:04.236
Babe, the boss
is about to lose the farm.

07:04.396 --> 07:08.116
- We'll all be sent away.
- There's no telling where we'll end up.

07:08.358 --> 07:11.158
Not every human is as kind as ours.

07:11.361 --> 07:13.201
- But what can I do?
- Nothing!

07:13.363 --> 07:16.163
You're a sheep-pig.
A champion, no less.

07:16.366 --> 07:18.406
- Pig!
- Most likely they'll want you to herd sheep.

07:18.576 --> 07:21.336
You can't leave. He can't leave!
You're my lucky pig.

07:21.538 --> 07:23.698
Pig!

07:25.417 --> 07:27.257
Pig!

07:28.545 --> 07:31.145
Arthur!
You call the wretched thing.

07:33.049 --> 07:34.889
Come, pig!

07:38.096 --> 07:39.936
Well, I must be off, then.

07:40.098 --> 07:42.898
You won't be alone, dear.
You'll be with the boss's wife.

07:43.101 --> 07:45.861
Oh, sure, the boss's wife. You'll be
in the company of a serial killer.

07:46.062 --> 07:48.382
Do not take counsel of your fears, lad.

07:48.565 --> 07:52.325
- Do you want to pee before you go?
- Uh, no, thank you.

07:52.569 --> 07:54.889
Come on. Come on, pig.

07:55.071 --> 07:56.911
But I need this pig.

07:57.073 --> 07:59.393
He's my lucky pig,
my good luck pig.

07:59.576 --> 08:01.416
Without him, I-I'm dead.

08:01.578 --> 08:04.898
Deceased! Lifeless! Extinct!
A demised duck!

08:06.958 --> 08:08.838
In you go.

08:11.588 --> 08:13.788
Can you come with me, Fly?

08:13.965 --> 08:16.685
I wish I could, dear,
but it's you they want.

08:16.885 --> 08:20.245
- Please?
- Stop it, now. You're a brave pig.

08:20.472 --> 08:23.272
And, Babe, more often than not
in this uncertain world,

08:23.475 --> 08:26.475
fortune favors the brave.

08:26.645 --> 08:29.485
Porridge in the morning. No sugar.
A little bit of salt, but not too much.

08:29.648 --> 08:31.528
Tea. No milk, just lemon.

08:31.650 --> 08:33.530
Okay, I think that's everything.

08:33.652 --> 08:35.692
Right. I'm off.

08:37.697 --> 08:39.256
Esme?

08:41.368 --> 08:44.688
Don't worry, Arthur.
I won't let anything happen to your pig.

08:48.541 --> 08:50.701
Arthur.

09:09.020 --> 09:11.100
And so, dear ones,

09:11.231 --> 09:13.591
the pig and the farmer's wife...

09:13.733 --> 09:16.013
ventured into the larger world.

09:18.613 --> 09:22.493
What follows is an account
of their calamitous adventures...

09:22.701 --> 09:25.221
and how a kind and steady heart...

09:25.370 --> 09:27.730
can mend a sorry world.

09:27.872 --> 09:29.952
Save the farm, Babe!

09:30.083 --> 09:32.043
Save the farm!

09:32.210 --> 09:35.250
Save the f-a-a-a-a-a-rm!

09:46.725 --> 09:49.605
La la la

09:49.769 --> 09:53.929
La-la la la-la

09:54.190 --> 09:57.470
La la la
la-la, la-la

09:57.694 --> 10:01.454
La la la la-la-la
Hey!

10:17.589 --> 10:19.629
Ohh!

10:23.762 --> 10:26.602
Stop. Stop!

10:26.765 --> 10:28.645
Whoa-oa!

10:45.617 --> 10:47.217
Pardon me, boy
- Huh?

10:47.327 --> 10:48.647
Is that the Chattanooga choo choo

10:48.787 --> 10:51.507
Yes, yes Track 29!

10:51.665 --> 10:53.945
Uh, pardon me, boys.

10:54.125 --> 10:55.965
Yeah?

10:56.127 --> 10:59.287
- Uh, see that fat, featherless
flying thing? - Uh-huh.

10:59.464 --> 11:01.344
- Any idea where it's headed?
- Follow us.

11:01.466 --> 11:03.746
Oh, good. Follow them.

11:03.927 --> 11:06.287
- Okay.
- Chattanooga, there you are

11:06.471 --> 11:07.791
She's gonna cry

11:07.931 --> 11:10.931
Until I tell her
that I'll never roam

11:11.142 --> 11:12.822
- So, Chattanooga choo choo
- Doodle-oo dee-doo, doo-doo-doo

11:12.977 --> 11:14.497
- Won't you choo-choo me home
- Doodley-doo

11:14.646 --> 11:16.166
- Chattanooga, Chattanooga
- Doo-doo-dee-deedle doo-dee

11:16.314 --> 11:18.834
- Get aboard
- Chattanooga, Chattanooga

11:18.984 --> 11:22.104
- All aboard - Dee-doodle
Chattanoogie-doodie-doo-doo

11:31.413 --> 11:33.253
Ohh-ohh... Whoa!

11:50.807 --> 11:54.087
Uh, uh, excuse me.

11:54.310 --> 11:57.110
- Excuse me, but I was wondering...
- Hey, look, pal, I'm busy.

11:57.313 --> 12:00.113
- Uh, well, I seem to have lost my human.
- Hey, hey, I'm workin' here.

12:00.317 --> 12:01.837
Capisce? Comprende?

12:03.028 --> 12:05.228
Whoa. Ain't you
a weird-lookin' puppy.

12:05.363 --> 12:07.723
I'm not a puppy.
I'm a sheep-pig.

12:07.866 --> 12:11.066
My human's gone, and I'm hungry,
and I'm supposed to save the farm.

12:11.286 --> 12:14.086
Yeah, that's truly tragic, but you see
that long line of stuff over there?

12:14.289 --> 12:17.169
- And all those piles yonder? You see 'em?
- Yes.

12:17.375 --> 12:20.175
Well, I gotta sniff every doggone
one of 'em. I'm a sniffer, ya see.

12:20.378 --> 12:22.698
- A fully-qualified,
triple-certificated sniffer. - Oh.

12:22.881 --> 12:25.001
It's all in the hooter, the schnozz,
the olfactory instrument.

12:25.175 --> 12:28.455
- You could be a sniffer with a schnozz like that.
- That's very kind of you, but...

12:28.678 --> 12:31.478
Don't interrupt me now.
I'm just gettin' to the good part.

12:31.681 --> 12:34.761
- When you sniff the right smell,
do ya know what happens? - Mm-mmm.

12:34.934 --> 12:37.214
You jump up and down and go berserk.
That's what happens.

12:37.395 --> 12:39.715
- You should see the humans come runnin'.
- They do? Why?

12:39.898 --> 12:42.058
Beats me, but it's sure important.
I get big rewards.

12:42.233 --> 12:45.553
- Rewards?
- Sure. My heart's desire. Watch this.

12:51.076 --> 12:54.596
Security guard, to the floor!

12:54.788 --> 12:58.788
Security guard, come to the floor!

12:59.042 --> 13:00.882
We got one.

13:06.925 --> 13:08.805
She could be my mother.

13:08.927 --> 13:10.807
Creepy, isn't it?

13:13.932 --> 13:15.812
Esme Cordelia Hoggett?

13:15.934 --> 13:17.814
Oh. Thank heaven.

13:17.936 --> 13:21.256
My pig hasn't come through, and I've
only got 15 minutes to make flight FF-115.

13:21.439 --> 13:23.319
I've got to get
to the other terminal,

13:23.441 --> 13:26.281
but there's no point me going
without the blessed pig.

13:26.444 --> 13:29.524
- Ma'am, we have the pig.
- Oh. Let's get a wriggle on, then.

13:29.739 --> 13:33.499
Oh. If we miss FF-115,
then we won't make the 4:15 shuttle.

13:33.743 --> 13:36.823
And if we don't make the 4:15 shuttle,
we won't make it in time for the fair.

13:36.997 --> 13:40.637
It's the grandaddy of all state fairs,
they say, and today's the very last day.

13:40.834 --> 13:43.674
It'll all be over
and we won't get the appearance money,

13:43.837 --> 13:47.637
and if we don't get the money the bank won't
take, "Sorry, I missed my flight" for an answer.

13:47.841 --> 13:50.481
That'll be it. All over.
Arrivederci, farm.

13:50.635 --> 13:53.275
Poor Arthur would be utterly...

13:55.473 --> 13:57.473
devastated.

14:00.186 --> 14:01.986
Esme Cordelia Hoggett,

14:02.147 --> 14:04.947
we have reason to believe you may be
carrying illegal substances on your person.

14:05.150 --> 14:07.470
Being an officer
of the Drug Enforcement Agency,

14:07.652 --> 14:10.892
I am authorized by law to
conduct certain... procedures.

14:11.114 --> 14:14.234
Please step into the cubicle
and remove your clothes.

14:16.119 --> 14:17.639
Pardon?

14:26.713 --> 14:29.673
Of course,
it was proved beyond any doubt...

14:29.841 --> 14:33.841
that Esme Cordelia Hoggett
was not a felon.

14:34.054 --> 14:37.614
But, sadly, they had missed
their all-important connection,

14:37.849 --> 14:39.689
and to make matters worse...

14:39.851 --> 14:44.051
they were obliged to wait some days
for the next flight home.

14:44.314 --> 14:47.714
They couldn't go forward,
and they couldn't go back.

14:47.901 --> 14:50.861
They were stranded.

14:58.703 --> 15:01.263
And so, you don't take pets.

15:01.414 --> 15:03.614
But he's just a little pig.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.950
Well, it's more of a dog, really.

15:06.127 --> 15:08.607
But it's practically human!

15:35.407 --> 15:37.927
Uh-huh?

15:38.076 --> 15:39.836
Scram, lady.

15:39.953 --> 15:42.153
This is not a farm.

15:57.846 --> 16:00.006
Excuse me.

16:00.181 --> 16:02.461
Flealands Hotel,
a few blocks south.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.480
You'll be welcome there.

16:06.104 --> 16:09.904
Esme Hoggett
studied the face of the stranger...

16:10.108 --> 16:11.988
Thank you.

16:12.110 --> 16:15.910
and wondered what could have provoked
his unexpected act of kindness.

16:23.246 --> 16:25.086
When the moon hits your eye

16:25.248 --> 16:26.888
Like a big pizza pie

16:27.042 --> 16:30.282
That's amore

16:30.462 --> 16:32.342
When the world seems to shine

16:32.464 --> 16:34.224
Like you've had too much wine

16:34.382 --> 16:37.662
That's amore

16:37.844 --> 16:40.484
Bells will ring, ting-a-ling-a-ling
Ting-a-ling-a-ling

16:40.638 --> 16:45.358
And you sing vita bella

16:45.643 --> 16:48.283
Hearts will play
Tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay

16:48.480 --> 16:51.280
Like a gay tarantella

17:09.751 --> 17:12.231
Oh.
I need a room for myself...

17:12.420 --> 17:15.220
and, uh, the, uh, wee pig.

17:16.758 --> 17:18.598
Huh?

17:18.760 --> 17:20.599
Are you crazy?
Animals in here?

17:20.762 --> 17:23.082
- What makes you think we take animals?
- Oh, but I...

17:23.263 --> 17:26.064
What kind of establishment
do you think this is? Well, it isn't.

17:26.267 --> 17:29.067
Am I aware of the city codes
and regulations? Yes.

17:29.270 --> 17:32.670
Am I one to break the law?
Absolutely not. I am very lawful.

17:40.824 --> 17:43.784
Are you hearing-impaired?
Go away!

18:08.435 --> 18:09.995
Psst!

18:10.103 --> 18:11.743
Psst!

18:11.896 --> 18:13.736
Mmm?

18:13.898 --> 18:16.698
- How long did you want to stay?
- I, uh... Two days.

18:16.901 --> 18:19.701
- Will an attic room do?
- Uh... Well, I thought you...

18:19.904 --> 18:22.224
That was just for the neighbors.
Heartless meanies.

18:22.407 --> 18:25.207
Where do they expect
these poor creatures to go?

18:25.410 --> 18:28.610
- Is he house-trained?
- Oh, yes. Just like you and me.

18:31.082 --> 18:32.922
Do we provide meals? No.

18:33.084 --> 18:36.244
But is there a convenience store?
Yes. Two blocks south.

18:36.421 --> 18:39.781
And what is the golden rule?
Never answer the front door.

18:39.966 --> 18:41.846
Why?
It might be an inspector.

18:41.968 --> 18:43.928
Mind that step.

18:44.095 --> 18:46.895
What happens if you need anything?

18:47.098 --> 18:49.418
You knock on this door on the left.

18:49.601 --> 18:51.441
Who lives there? I do.

18:51.603 --> 18:54.403
Where's the bathroom?
End of the landing.

18:54.606 --> 18:56.526
Do we provide towels?

18:56.691 --> 18:59.491
What is that, a canine? Huh?
You canine? Little puppy dog?

18:59.694 --> 19:02.174
Flealick, come back.
We don't know where it's been.

19:02.322 --> 19:04.202
- Do we, Alan?
- No, Nigel.

19:04.324 --> 19:07.164
- Feline. You're a cat?
- Do I look like a cat?

19:07.327 --> 19:10.447
How do I know? I got the myopia. I can
barely see. If you're a cat, you gotta scat.

19:10.622 --> 19:13.462
Hey! Kitty! You got no business
being on this floor!

19:13.625 --> 19:17.625
You got that? No felines
on this floor. Period!

19:17.879 --> 19:20.199
Where's the pay phone?
In the foyer.

19:20.382 --> 19:22.222
Local calls only.

19:22.384 --> 19:25.664
And where does the little piggy stay
at all times?

19:25.887 --> 19:27.727
In the room.

19:27.889 --> 19:32.129
Meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow

19:32.352 --> 19:36.152
And where does the dear little fella
do his necessaries?

19:36.356 --> 19:38.236
In the kitty litter.

19:38.358 --> 19:40.558
Who empties it?

19:40.694 --> 19:42.814
You do.
Any questions?

19:42.987 --> 19:46.267
Oh. Where do I make
a long-distance phone call?

19:46.491 --> 19:49.531
Oh, uh, two blocks south.
Mm-hmm.

20:01.673 --> 20:03.513
Oh.

20:10.015 --> 20:11.695
Stay, pig.

20:11.850 --> 20:13.690
Stay.

20:22.777 --> 20:26.217
Babe looked out
across this vast habitat,

20:26.406 --> 20:28.446
abundant with humans
and other creatures,

20:28.575 --> 20:32.535
and wondered when he would
see his first sheep.

20:32.746 --> 20:34.946
Then the thought occurred to him:

20:35.123 --> 20:37.323
Maybe it wasn't sheepherding.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.300
Maybe something else
was required of him.

20:43.465 --> 20:45.305
Whatever the case,

20:45.467 --> 20:49.627
in this place with its dark corners
and endless possibilities,

20:49.888 --> 20:53.648
the pig felt sure he would find a way
to redeem himself.

21:02.734 --> 21:04.614
Aww.

21:17.791 --> 21:19.991
Can...
Uh, can I help you?

21:21.127 --> 21:22.927
What are you doing?

21:25.674 --> 21:27.314
I beg your pardon?

21:28.718 --> 21:31.278
Hey.
Uh, w-wait a minute.

21:31.429 --> 21:33.989
But...

21:34.140 --> 21:37.100
Uh, that belongs to the boss's wife.

21:37.268 --> 21:39.148
Hey, that... Come back!

21:39.270 --> 21:41.350
Uh, hey!

21:46.611 --> 21:48.491
Wait up!

21:48.613 --> 21:50.453
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, yeah!

21:50.615 --> 21:54.255
- Whoa. If you're not a cat, stay and chat.
- Sorry.

21:54.452 --> 21:58.292
We don't get out much on account of Nig and
AI and their nerves. They're a little nervous.

21:58.498 --> 22:01.818
Me, on account of the hips.
Well, don't be a stranger. It was...

22:04.129 --> 22:06.849
Open up, please.

22:07.007 --> 22:08.887
Open this door!

22:15.223 --> 22:17.663
You got a problem, sweetie?

22:17.809 --> 22:20.729
- Uh... I...
- Who is it, honey?

22:20.937 --> 22:23.897
It's, uh, kind of
a baldy, pinky, whitey thingy.

22:24.107 --> 22:26.067
Show 'im in.

22:30.572 --> 22:32.932
I'd like the bag back, please.

22:35.118 --> 22:38.038
Hey, pinkness, look at the little guy.

22:38.204 --> 22:40.244
You wanna break his heart?

22:40.373 --> 22:43.133
But it doesn't belong to him.

22:43.335 --> 22:45.175
All I know is what I see:

22:45.337 --> 22:48.137
Tug comes in with the bag,
just doin' his job, collectin' stuff,

22:48.340 --> 22:51.140
and you barge in here "accusicating"
and making "demandments".

22:51.343 --> 22:53.903
I didn't see you with the bag.

22:54.054 --> 22:56.014
Who's to say it belongs to you?

22:56.181 --> 22:58.141
I'm not leaving without the bag.

22:58.308 --> 23:01.428
I don't think my big brother,
Bob Bobalooba, the Big Banana,

23:01.644 --> 23:05.004
is "mis-splaining"
how things work around here.

23:05.190 --> 23:07.070
Well, I have to warn you:

23:07.192 --> 23:10.992
I may be small,
but I can be ferocious if provoked.

23:11.196 --> 23:13.196
And what have we here?

23:15.033 --> 23:17.393
Well, uh, we're in a negotiation...

23:17.535 --> 23:19.655
with this naked, pink individual.

23:19.829 --> 23:22.229
He's of foreign extraction, Your Honor.

23:22.374 --> 23:24.254
Possibly even an alien.

23:24.376 --> 23:25.976
You drooling imbeciles.

23:26.127 --> 23:30.807
This is an omnivorous mammal
of the order Ungulata,

23:31.049 --> 23:33.889
an inconsequential species
with no other purpose...

23:34.052 --> 23:36.412
than to be eaten by humans.

23:36.554 --> 23:40.034
This lowly, handless,
deeply unattractive mud-lover...

23:40.225 --> 23:42.105
is a pig.

23:42.227 --> 23:44.667
- Oh.
- For your information,

23:44.854 --> 23:48.654
I'm a sheep-pig,
and I've been sent to save the farm.

23:48.900 --> 23:53.220
Come to think of it,
I should be saving the farm right now.

23:53.446 --> 23:56.766
A- And if you can't say anything nice,
don't say anything at all.

23:58.451 --> 24:01.291
So, will this little
pink "lunchness"...

24:01.454 --> 24:04.774
fulfill his destiny,
nourishmentally speaking?

24:06.751 --> 24:08.631
We shall see.

24:08.753 --> 24:12.953
I feel very uncomfortable
with this conversation.

24:13.216 --> 24:15.296
I want my bag back.
Get out of my way!

24:28.106 --> 24:31.186
Uncle Fugly!

24:31.401 --> 24:33.241
Uncle Fugly!

24:44.080 --> 24:45.920
Uncle Fugly!

24:46.082 --> 24:47.922
Huh?

24:48.084 --> 24:50.004
- Please let me out.
- Uncle Fugly!

24:51.129 --> 24:53.009
There's been a theft upstairs.

24:53.131 --> 24:55.011
Can you imagine?

24:55.133 --> 24:57.373
Esme Hoggett, Fugly Floom.

24:57.510 --> 24:59.390
Uncle Fugly, Esme Hoggett.

24:59.512 --> 25:01.992
- Perhaps we should call the police.
- No, no. No police.

25:02.140 --> 25:05.820
No authorities. It would be the end
of this place. Surely you understand.

25:06.061 --> 25:10.421
Oh, dear. I just phoned my Arthur to
tell him that at least his pig was safe.

25:10.648 --> 25:13.008
- Now, on top of everything else...
- Hey! That's my human!

25:13.151 --> 25:16.951
- Remember, we have found your clothes.
- I don't care about clothes.

25:17.155 --> 25:20.635
But the pig...
I can't go home without the pig.

25:25.955 --> 25:30.395
Did you get that?

25:30.669 --> 25:34.869
Approximately five minutes ago something that
looked like a pig exited this establishment.

25:35.131 --> 25:38.891
Where did he go? Left on Canal Street,
and then in the direction of the beach.

25:39.135 --> 25:41.255
Okay. Thank you.

25:45.141 --> 25:49.221
Meow

25:49.479 --> 25:51.319
- Meow, meow
- What's that?

25:51.481 --> 25:53.321
It's beautiful.

25:53.483 --> 25:55.403
Oh, it's lovely.

25:55.527 --> 25:57.407
Meow, meow

25:59.823 --> 26:02.223
Ohh!

26:02.367 --> 26:03.767
They all ran after
the farmer's wife

26:03.868 --> 26:05.028
She cut off their tails
with a carving knife

26:05.161 --> 26:07.041
Did you ever see
such a sight in your life

26:07.205 --> 26:10.445
As three blind mice

26:20.927 --> 26:23.087
Pig!

26:23.221 --> 26:25.101
Pig!

26:26.224 --> 26:28.104
Pig!

26:28.226 --> 26:31.066
Here, pig-pig-pig-pig-piggy!

26:32.731 --> 26:34.811
Here, pig-pig-pig-pig!

26:34.983 --> 26:37.783
Pig! Pig!

26:41.072 --> 26:42.952
Pig!

26:44.159 --> 26:45.999
Pig!

26:49.956 --> 26:52.356
Here, pig-pig-pig-pig-piggy!

26:54.044 --> 26:55.884
Who you callin' a pig, lady?

26:56.046 --> 26:58.246
Not you. Another pig.

26:58.423 --> 27:01.463
- My husband's pig. You know...
- What's in the bag?

27:02.719 --> 27:05.639
Give it here!

27:05.805 --> 27:08.285
Aaaaah!

27:18.318 --> 27:20.518
Whoa!

27:24.616 --> 27:26.456
Ohh!

27:26.618 --> 27:28.618
Oh, dear.
Ohh!

28:14.874 --> 28:18.674
Show business may not be as
honorable a profession as sheepherding,

28:18.878 --> 28:22.238
but the pig was willing
to endure the ridicule...

28:22.465 --> 28:25.265
if it would help put things right
back at Hoggett Hollow.

28:30.849 --> 28:34.049
And the animals had told him
if all went well...

28:34.227 --> 28:36.107
there would be big rewards.

28:36.229 --> 28:39.069
- Uh, hey, so, when do I get paid?
- Shh!

29:04.841 --> 29:08.281
Sir, I gotta get going now.
How do I collect my reward?

29:08.511 --> 29:10.231
I told you, stay under the table!

29:10.388 --> 29:13.188
Yep. Okay, uh... Uh...

29:31.368 --> 29:36.248
Non, rien de rien

29:36.539 --> 29:39.979
Non, je ne regrette rien

29:42.045 --> 29:44.365
Ni le bien

29:44.547 --> 29:47.107
Qu'on m'a fait

29:47.258 --> 29:48.658
Ni le mal

29:48.760 --> 29:53.200
Tout ca m'est bien egal

29:53.431 --> 29:57.551
Non, rien de rien

29:58.770 --> 30:03.290
Non, je ne regrette rien

30:03.566 --> 30:05.766
C'est paye

30:05.944 --> 30:08.544
Balaye

30:08.738 --> 30:10.578
Take your hands off me!

30:10.740 --> 30:13.780
Oh... Oh... Ohh! It's a mistake!
I'm a grandmother!

30:13.952 --> 30:15.832
Somebody help, please!
Call Farmer Hoggett!

30:15.954 --> 30:18.794
Okay, freak show's over!
Finished! Come on!

30:18.957 --> 30:21.797
Help! Help!

30:40.979 --> 30:42.859
Just tell me.

30:42.981 --> 30:45.261
There is no reward, is there?

30:46.443 --> 30:48.563
Was there ever such a thing?

30:48.695 --> 30:51.575
Oh, little pink thingy,
this is the city.

30:51.781 --> 30:55.061
As Bob always says...
What do you say, Bob?

30:55.285 --> 30:59.045
It's all illusory...
it's ill, and it's for losers.

30:59.289 --> 31:01.129
Naw, that wasn't it.

31:01.291 --> 31:04.531
You know, that stuff
about no yesterday and no tomorrow.

31:04.711 --> 31:06.911
All you got
is this actual "now-ness".

31:07.047 --> 31:09.967
The past is gone, and as for
the future...

31:10.175 --> 31:13.455
Yeah. No guarantees,
my little pork pie.

31:13.678 --> 31:16.918
It's a dog-eat-dog world
and there's not enough dog to go around.

31:17.140 --> 31:19.940
So you look after number whatsy.

31:20.143 --> 31:22.703
- Get my drift?
- I'm not a pork pie.

31:22.854 --> 31:25.094
Whatever you say, cutie pie.

31:25.231 --> 31:29.511
I'm not any kind of pie.
I'm just a pig on a mission.

31:46.169 --> 31:49.769
It's tough
if you're a pig alone in the city.

31:50.006 --> 31:52.006
It can leave you empty.

31:52.175 --> 31:54.015
And whom do you turn to?

31:54.177 --> 31:56.817
Where was the boss's wife?

31:57.013 --> 32:01.853
He thought it might help if he could recall
Fly and Rex and their steadfast words,

32:02.102 --> 32:04.302
and he tried really hard,

32:04.437 --> 32:08.157
but he could barely remember
the face of his beloved boss.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.240
The farm was fading.

32:10.402 --> 32:13.602
It had become just a comforting dream,

32:13.822 --> 32:15.662
an echo.

32:20.328 --> 32:24.248
Is your heart
filled with pain

32:24.499 --> 32:27.979
Shall I come back again

32:28.211 --> 32:30.051
Tell me, dear

32:30.213 --> 32:32.533
Are you lonesome

32:32.716 --> 32:35.196
Tonight

32:35.385 --> 32:39.745
Whoo-ooh-hoo-hoo
Whoo-oooh

32:48.314 --> 32:50.674
Huh?

34:15.485 --> 34:18.605
Are we okay, Thelonius?

34:21.991 --> 34:23.831
Thelonius?

34:23.993 --> 34:27.233
I couldn't wake him.
I tried.

34:27.414 --> 34:29.293
But he wouldn't wake up.

34:29.416 --> 34:31.295
He'll be back.

34:31.418 --> 34:34.178
Himself always comes back.

34:36.297 --> 34:38.377
Thelonius?

34:39.717 --> 34:43.318
Easy, let him be.

35:10.081 --> 35:12.401
Let's see.

35:12.584 --> 35:14.744
Mm-hmm.

35:16.087 --> 35:17.967
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

35:18.089 --> 35:20.169
Uh, this looks good.

35:22.302 --> 35:26.502
Yeah, just drop me off, uh...
Yeah, right here'll be fine.

35:26.765 --> 35:29.045
Uh, thanks for the ride, pal.

35:29.225 --> 35:33.145
- I just hope you get that operation
for your wing. - Yeah, right, uh-huh.

35:33.396 --> 35:36.196
I mean, not being able
to fly long distances,

35:36.399 --> 35:39.199
on top of the amount of family tragedies
you've suffered...

35:39.402 --> 35:42.962
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah, yeah. Don't sweat it. See ya.

35:44.616 --> 35:48.056
Farewell, noble duck.

35:52.248 --> 35:55.248
Okey-dokey,
you are cleared for landing.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.300
Here we go.
Flaps down... Ohh!

35:57.462 --> 35:59.302
Perfect.

35:59.464 --> 36:01.504
Oh.

36:01.633 --> 36:03.753
Hmm... Huh?
Hey!

36:03.927 --> 36:05.927
Huh? Huh?

36:09.140 --> 36:11.540
Whoa!

36:27.283 --> 36:29.443
Pig.

36:29.619 --> 36:32.419
Pig.

36:43.633 --> 36:46.433
By nightfall, all Babe's concerns,]

36:46.636 --> 36:51.676
all the troubled voices in his head
were drowned out by one insistent moan.

36:51.975 --> 36:54.295
Food.

36:54.477 --> 36:57.677
The fact is, Babe's belly
was making such a fuss...

36:57.856 --> 37:00.376
he began to believe
it was talking to him.

37:00.525 --> 37:02.325
- Food!
- Huh?

37:02.485 --> 37:04.845
Anybody got any food?

37:05.030 --> 37:07.350
Anybody?

37:07.532 --> 37:11.212
Hey, dogs, you got any edibles,
any nibbly-dibblies?

37:11.411 --> 37:14.251
We got a carpet here
with some nice spaghetti stains.

37:14.414 --> 37:17.774
- But we can't keep licking the carpet, can we, Alan?
- No, Nigel.

37:18.001 --> 37:20.081
Hey, cats! Cats!

37:20.211 --> 37:22.091
What about you?

37:22.213 --> 37:24.773
No, no, no, no food
No food, no food

37:24.924 --> 37:27.644
No food, no food
We have no food

37:27.844 --> 37:30.324
Well, then,
I'm gonna get "proactivated".

37:30.513 --> 37:32.953
I know where there's food a-plentiful.

37:33.099 --> 37:35.779
We're goin' outside?
Without a human?

37:35.935 --> 37:39.295
Could be kinda dangerous, you know,
in a lethally sort of way.

37:39.522 --> 37:41.362
We'll stick to the shadows, honey.

37:41.524 --> 37:43.844
It's coolness.

38:06.091 --> 38:09.531
Hey. Hey, wait!
Wait a minute!

38:11.930 --> 38:14.490
Where's the food?
I have to eat!

38:14.641 --> 38:16.561
Hey, keep your voice down.

38:16.726 --> 38:19.046
I'll do anything, absolutely anything.

38:19.229 --> 38:21.069
Ah, go "porkinate".

38:21.231 --> 38:24.031
What can you do?
You don't even have any hands.

38:24.234 --> 38:26.074
What can I do?
Uh, lots.

38:26.236 --> 38:28.236
Yeah, right.

38:28.405 --> 38:30.405
Uh, sheep!
I can herd sheep!

38:30.573 --> 38:33.693
Go home, sweetie.
You're making a spectacle of yourself.

38:33.910 --> 38:38.030
Wait a momentum. I'm thinking
I might have some sheep for him to herd.

38:38.289 --> 38:40.929
- You do?
- Uh-huh. I'll show ya.

38:43.795 --> 38:46.915
Right here, behind the Food-O-Rama,

38:47.132 --> 38:49.292
is where they keep the sheep.

38:50.969 --> 38:52.969
I'm gonna open this hole.

38:55.140 --> 38:57.420
Open Sez-a-Bob.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.640
They're in there.

39:02.689 --> 39:05.049
Border Leicester
or Scottish Blackface?

39:05.191 --> 39:08.431
Pit bull and a Doberman pinscher.
Very exotic breeds.

39:08.653 --> 39:11.933
Uh, where do you want me to herd them?

39:12.157 --> 39:16.317
That's up to you. Just keep them
occupied till we get the necessaries.

39:16.578 --> 39:18.418
Okey-dokey.

39:21.541 --> 39:23.421
Hello?

39:25.503 --> 39:27.343
Hello?

39:27.505 --> 39:29.665
Anybody home?

39:34.637 --> 39:36.917
Uh, anybody else?

39:37.098 --> 39:40.858
You must have
a very thin grasp on reality.

39:43.104 --> 39:46.544
Unless, of course,
you are suicidal.

39:46.733 --> 39:48.613
Uh, I'm just looking...

39:48.735 --> 39:50.815
for some sheep.

39:50.987 --> 39:52.507
I warned you.

39:53.865 --> 39:55.985
Aaah!

40:01.915 --> 40:04.595
Baa, ram, ewe!

40:05.919 --> 40:07.279
Baa, ram, ewe!

40:07.379 --> 40:10.179
To your breed, your fleece,
to your clan be true!

40:10.382 --> 40:11.822
Baa, ram, ewe!

40:16.388 --> 40:19.428
Down here, honey.

40:19.599 --> 40:21.479
Take care, now.

40:40.078 --> 40:42.518
I'll head him off!

40:51.089 --> 40:52.969
Let me in!

40:53.091 --> 40:55.371
Please! Somebody!

40:55.552 --> 40:57.472
Let me in!

40:57.595 --> 40:59.715
Let me in!

40:59.889 --> 41:01.929
Open the door!

41:16.948 --> 41:19.428
Darling, don't get yourself in a state.

41:19.617 --> 41:22.897
It's not my imagination.
Something is going on in that place.

41:23.121 --> 41:25.441
Hortense, you'll miss the aria!

41:25.623 --> 41:27.703
Hortense!

41:27.834 --> 41:29.714
Hmph!

41:37.093 --> 41:39.093
Aah!

41:55.445 --> 41:57.445
I'm gonna catch me!
I'm gonna catch me!

42:41.157 --> 42:42.517
Aaah!

43:13.565 --> 43:15.245
Whoa-ohh!

43:35.628 --> 43:38.428
Something broke through the terror...

43:38.590 --> 43:42.110
flickerings,
fragments of his short life,

43:42.302 --> 43:45.542
the random events
that delivered him to this,

43:45.764 --> 43:47.604
his moment of annihilation.

43:47.766 --> 43:50.366
As terror gave way to exhaustion,

43:50.560 --> 43:54.520
Babe turned to his attacker, his eyes
filled with one simple question:

43:54.773 --> 43:56.613
Why?

43:59.110 --> 44:00.950
Aaah!

44:50.662 --> 44:54.262
This is what happens, Alan,
on the outside.

44:54.499 --> 44:56.139
It's the times, Nigel.

45:07.512 --> 45:09.552
Honey, come away.

46:09.282 --> 46:12.082
Please, someone, give us a hand!

46:14.746 --> 46:16.626
Please!

47:02.585 --> 47:05.185
Kind sir? Kind sir?

47:05.338 --> 47:07.218
Can you help me?

47:07.340 --> 47:10.660
I have been cruelly cast out
and have nowhere to go.

47:10.844 --> 47:13.004
- Oh, but how?
- Please. Please.

47:13.138 --> 47:15.498
I know you're different from the others.

47:15.640 --> 47:18.880
Those that have had their way with me
make their empty promises,

47:19.102 --> 47:21.662
but they are all lies... lies.

47:21.813 --> 47:23.773
- But, uh...
- I'm cold.

47:23.940 --> 47:27.580
And I'm afraid
and terribly, terribly tired.

47:27.819 --> 47:31.939
- Where's your human?
- My humans belong to someone else now.

47:32.157 --> 47:34.357
Someone younger and prettier.

47:34.492 --> 47:36.852
I, uh, I never,
ever had a h-h-human.

47:36.995 --> 47:38.875
I'm hungry.

47:38.997 --> 47:41.837
My human tied me in a bag
and throwed me in the water.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.560
My tummy hurts.

47:43.668 --> 47:45.548
Try not to think about it.

47:45.670 --> 47:47.550
Take pity on us.

47:47.672 --> 47:51.552
We are the excluded
and have nowhere to go.

47:51.801 --> 47:54.841
Well, uh, it is nice and warm inside.

47:55.013 --> 47:57.133
- Not a good idea.
- Oh, but they...

47:57.307 --> 47:59.147
No. No. "No-ness".

48:00.351 --> 48:02.431
Uh, could that be food?

48:02.562 --> 48:05.682
Oh, have mercy.

48:07.108 --> 48:09.388
Quiet.

48:09.527 --> 48:11.447
Quiet!

48:12.739 --> 48:15.579
You'll bring all manner of trouble.

48:15.742 --> 48:20.182
Uh, perhaps if we all
went inside and we all line up,

48:20.413 --> 48:23.253
I'm sure
there'll be enough to go around.

48:23.416 --> 48:26.376
You're talkin'
as if you're the word around here.

48:26.544 --> 48:28.904
I'd say he is.

48:30.131 --> 48:32.451
I'd like to offer up a solution...

48:32.634 --> 48:35.674
that I feel confident
you'll all respond to:

48:35.887 --> 48:38.407
Whatever the pig says goes.

48:38.556 --> 48:40.436
Anyone hostile to the notion?

48:40.558 --> 48:43.438
- No! No, no! - No problem!
- Whatever the pig says, yeah!

48:43.603 --> 48:45.603
Anybody else?

48:45.730 --> 48:48.490
Fine by moi.

48:48.691 --> 48:52.011
Anybody else else?

48:58.451 --> 49:00.531
It's still just a pig.

49:13.758 --> 49:16.398
Well, fluff my fur.

49:16.594 --> 49:18.434
This recalls the glory days...

49:18.596 --> 49:20.556
when I was dizzy with privilege.

49:20.724 --> 49:24.124
I had my hair styled and my nails
manicured each and every day.

49:24.310 --> 49:26.750
- Freeloaders.
- Riffraff with no manners.

49:26.938 --> 49:29.298
They'll soil willy-nilly,
won't they, Alan?

49:29.441 --> 49:31.321
Willy-nilly, Nigel.

49:32.777 --> 49:37.337
Hey. Swine.
I want you to have this collar.

49:37.615 --> 49:39.655
Um...

49:39.784 --> 49:41.664
that's not necessary.

49:41.786 --> 49:44.666
- Yes, it is.
- Uh, you're very kind, but...

49:44.831 --> 49:46.711
No, no, I'm anything but kind.

49:46.833 --> 49:49.873
In fact, I have a professional
obligation to be malicious.

49:50.086 --> 49:51.726
Then you should change jobs.

49:51.880 --> 49:53.560
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

49:53.673 --> 49:56.713
No, no, it's in the bloodline.
We were once warriors.

49:56.926 --> 49:58.446
Now there's just the urge.

49:58.595 --> 50:01.595
A murderous shadow
lies hard across my soul.

50:01.806 --> 50:03.646
So...

50:03.808 --> 50:06.928
- should I have let you drown?
- Most would have.

50:07.145 --> 50:11.185
Pig, if you were to wear my collar,
it would honor me.

50:11.441 --> 50:13.281
Yeah.

50:16.112 --> 50:18.432
Thank the pig.

50:18.615 --> 50:21.495
- Thank you, pig.
- You're welcome.

50:23.453 --> 50:24.813
Thank the pig.

50:24.954 --> 50:27.074
Thank you, pig.

50:27.207 --> 50:29.087
You're welcome.

50:31.336 --> 50:33.216
Thank the pig.

50:33.338 --> 50:35.218
Thank you, pig.

50:35.340 --> 50:37.220
You're awfully welcome.

50:39.344 --> 50:41.224
- Thank the pig.
- Thank you, pig.

50:41.346 --> 50:43.226
You're welcome.

50:43.348 --> 50:45.228
- Thank you, pig.
- You're welcome.

50:46.434 --> 50:48.274
Thank the pig.

50:48.436 --> 50:50.756
- Thank you, little thingy.
- You're welcome.

50:51.940 --> 50:54.700
Here.

50:54.859 --> 50:56.739
Thank the pig.

50:57.862 --> 51:00.102
Hey! You!

51:01.282 --> 51:03.122
Thanks.

51:03.284 --> 51:05.524
And some for you.

51:05.704 --> 51:07.624
Thank you,

51:07.747 --> 51:09.987
Your Honor.

51:12.544 --> 51:15.064
Thank the pig.

51:15.213 --> 51:18.253
Thank you. Oh, thank you, pig.

51:19.718 --> 51:22.678
- Thank the pig.
- Thank you, pig.

51:27.225 --> 51:29.305
Thank you, Thelonius.

51:34.315 --> 51:38.355
Okay, folks, cafeteria closed!

51:38.570 --> 51:40.450
I'm still hungry.

51:40.572 --> 51:43.732
A couple of jelly beans
don't even hit the bottom.

51:43.908 --> 51:47.108
- If only there weren't so many of those cats.
- Will someone slap the dog?

51:47.287 --> 51:48.847
- Watch it, pussy!
- Hey!

51:48.955 --> 51:51.715
Shove it, butt-sniffer!

51:51.916 --> 51:53.876
- Listen...
- Hey!

51:54.919 --> 51:58.599
The chief has somethin' to say.

51:58.798 --> 52:00.678
Um, well,

52:00.800 --> 52:03.640
uh, maybe cats and dogs...

52:03.803 --> 52:06.643
could, um, you know,
be nicer to each other.

52:06.806 --> 52:08.686
Right.

52:08.808 --> 52:11.608
It is decreed that
all cats and dogs...

52:11.770 --> 52:14.850
put aside their instinctive and
fanatical abhorrence of each other...

52:15.065 --> 52:19.945
and that all creatures, great and
diminutive, shall be of equal stature,

52:20.236 --> 52:22.156
with rights to liberty and justice...

52:22.280 --> 52:24.000
That nobody can deny

52:24.115 --> 52:26.475
And so say all of us.

52:26.618 --> 52:29.378
I'm still hungry.

52:32.123 --> 52:33.963
My tummy...

52:34.125 --> 52:36.565
it feels all... thingy.

52:36.753 --> 52:38.593
I know, honey.

52:38.755 --> 52:41.555
We did all the work.
We should get the biggest share.

52:41.758 --> 52:45.558
No, honey. Here.

52:48.348 --> 52:50.228
- What?
- Mmm.

52:50.350 --> 52:52.230
What's wrong?

52:52.352 --> 52:54.712
Um...

52:54.854 --> 52:57.694
Nothin'.

53:00.110 --> 53:03.550
And so, dear ones,
this topsy-turvy night...

53:03.780 --> 53:06.100
was to end with a beginning.

53:22.674 --> 53:26.434
This event, that weaves
a thread from past to future,

53:26.678 --> 53:29.718
soothed the tired hearts
of those assembled...

53:29.931 --> 53:31.851
and, for a while at least,

53:32.016 --> 53:33.856
they put aside their uncertainties.

53:46.156 --> 53:48.116
I'm an uncle.

53:48.241 --> 53:50.321
Twice.

53:54.039 --> 53:56.199
Who's like us?

53:56.374 --> 53:58.214
- Darn few.
- Darn few.

53:58.376 --> 54:00.216
Yeah.

54:00.378 --> 54:02.218
Darn few.

54:02.380 --> 54:05.060
- Well done!
- Congratulations, Mom.

54:05.216 --> 54:07.576
Look at that little face.

54:07.719 --> 54:11.239
- They're so cute. Look at that.
- They got their father's ears.

54:11.473 --> 54:14.633
I just wanna lick 'em
all over their little faces.

54:14.851 --> 54:18.611
On behalf of us all,
I'm sure the chief...

54:18.855 --> 54:20.975
would like to, uh,

54:21.149 --> 54:23.109
extend a special welcome,

54:23.234 --> 54:26.074
so, uh, listen up!

54:26.237 --> 54:29.717
Well, uh, I... Hmm.

54:29.908 --> 54:31.668
Ahem.

54:31.826 --> 54:34.626
If I had

54:34.829 --> 54:36.669
Words

54:36.831 --> 54:42.191
I'd sing a day for you

54:42.504 --> 54:47.064
- La la la la la-la
- I'd sing you a morning

54:47.300 --> 54:50.420
- La-la la la
- Golden and true

54:50.595 --> 54:53.195
La la la la

54:53.390 --> 54:57.430
La la la la la

54:57.644 --> 55:00.564
- La-la la la-la
- Blah-blah, blah blah-blah

55:00.772 --> 55:04.172
- La-la-la la la
- Blah-blah-blah, blah blah

55:04.401 --> 55:08.161
La la la la, la la la la la-la

55:08.405 --> 55:10.245
Huh? Hmm.

55:10.407 --> 55:14.247
La la la la la-la
La-la la la

55:14.452 --> 55:16.332
Pig. Pig!

55:19.457 --> 55:22.297
Oh, God, Roger,
the place is teeming.

55:22.460 --> 55:24.540
Overrun with filthy animals.

55:24.713 --> 55:26.553
It's a zoo!

55:26.715 --> 55:31.275
La la la la, la la la la la-la

55:31.553 --> 55:34.193
La la la la la-la
La-la la la

55:36.349 --> 55:39.029
Ohh! Ferdinand!

55:40.937 --> 55:43.417
Hey. Hey, pig!
Pig, where you goin'?

55:43.606 --> 55:47.006
La la la-a-a-a-a

55:48.278 --> 55:50.558
Oh-oh-oh-ohh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:53.199 --> 55:56.199
- Oh, Ferdy!
- Give us a peck! Come on, pig!

55:56.369 --> 55:58.729
- Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.
- Oooh!

55:58.872 --> 56:00.752
- Who are these losers?
- Ferdy!

56:00.874 --> 56:03.234
What's going on here?
You look different.

56:03.376 --> 56:07.296
- Yeah, well, this place can really take it out of ya.
- Tell me about it.

56:07.505 --> 56:12.145
But hey, I'm with my pig.
My lucky, lucky pig!

56:12.427 --> 56:14.267
Little ol' Ferdy,

56:14.429 --> 56:17.069
snug and safe at last.

56:18.183 --> 56:19.503
Aaah!

56:29.027 --> 56:31.827
- Man!
- It's gonna be a real busy night.

56:32.030 --> 56:35.070
I'll check upstairs.

56:40.038 --> 56:43.238
My word!

56:51.007 --> 56:54.207
There's no one home!

56:54.386 --> 56:57.346
Come on. Come on.

56:59.641 --> 57:01.481
Ooh!
Well, bite my tail.

57:05.146 --> 57:06.946
Doll, don't go there.

57:12.320 --> 57:14.640
Good girl.

57:14.823 --> 57:18.263
Oh, that's my pretty girl, yeah.

57:18.493 --> 57:20.053
Pig, let's go home.

57:26.710 --> 57:29.510
Pick up some more cages!

57:51.067 --> 57:52.907
Over here.

58:00.201 --> 58:01.841
Now!

58:10.128 --> 58:11.968
Careful now.

58:13.423 --> 58:15.583
Pig? Pig! Huh? Huh?

58:17.469 --> 58:19.349
Okay, you're gonna be all right.

58:19.471 --> 58:21.231
- You got him?
- Easy.

58:28.772 --> 58:31.892
Hey, fetch another cage!

58:37.155 --> 58:38.995
Come on, Zootie.

58:48.625 --> 58:50.465
- Okay, now.
- Okay.

58:50.627 --> 58:52.427
You got him?
You got him?

58:52.545 --> 58:55.465
Reel him in. Pull him in, pull him in.
Come on, you got him.

58:55.673 --> 58:57.993
Peep, peep
said the chick in the barnyard

58:58.176 --> 59:00.696
Quack, quack, said the duck
Won't you let me in

59:00.845 --> 59:04.725
Cluck, cluck, cluck said the little
red hen Let's boogie in the barnyard

59:04.974 --> 59:06.814
Baa baa, said the sheep
from another hole

59:06.976 --> 59:10.496
Moo moo, said the cow
Let the butter roll

59:10.688 --> 59:13.888
Cluck cluck, said the little red hen
Let's boogie in the barnyard

59:14.109 --> 59:16.989
Yes, the barnyard's jumpin'

59:17.195 --> 59:20.195
Everybody's havin' their fling

59:20.365 --> 59:22.525
Okay.

59:22.700 --> 59:25.500
Net.

59:32.377 --> 59:34.617
Are... Are there
any cats in here?

59:34.796 --> 59:37.596
Cats? Absolutely not.
No cat would dare come in here.

59:37.799 --> 59:39.959
But I'm allergic to ca... to ca...

59:42.053 --> 59:45.333
For crying out loud!

59:48.059 --> 59:51.739
Oh! Got you! Hey! Hey!

59:54.941 --> 59:57.381
Good heavens!
His heart condition!

59:57.569 --> 59:59.569
He'll kill himself,
won't he, Alan?

59:59.738 --> 01:00:01.578
Yes, Nigel.

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:03.980
- Flealick! Flealick!
- Flealick!

01:00:04.159 --> 01:00:07.919
- See any more?
- No, that does it.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:14.490
Hey, get a load of this.

01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:19.888
Go.

01:00:26.014 --> 01:00:29.694
Think we can get out of here
without either one of us getting hurt?

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.848
How about you cooperate with me?

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:49.517
Do something!

01:00:49.704 --> 01:00:52.184
Um... uh... uh, water!

01:00:52.332 --> 01:00:53.852
He needs water!

01:00:58.963 --> 01:01:01.323
No more up here!

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:15.817
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.620
- Hey, pig!
- Oh!

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.734
Sorry.

01:01:29.828 --> 01:01:32.548
- Someone help me.
- Why can't you do anything?

01:01:35.667 --> 01:01:37.507
Eeewww!

01:01:42.006 --> 01:01:45.646
Who-o-o-o-o-ah!

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:50.003
Thank you, pig!

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:59.073
Whoa!

01:02:13.788 --> 01:02:15.668
Aaah!

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:31.385
What is that?
Get it out of here.

01:02:31.556 --> 01:02:33.476
What are we gonna do with that?

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.600
Ow!

01:02:35.727 --> 01:02:37.607
Come on! Let's go!

01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:46.910
- Flealick!
- Flealick!

01:02:49.574 --> 01:02:51.974
What happened to you?

01:03:01.753 --> 01:03:04.233
Flealick? Flealick!

01:03:12.138 --> 01:03:15.978
Let go! Let go, Flealick!

01:03:24.484 --> 01:03:28.604
Oh, pig! Pig!

01:04:27.338 --> 01:04:29.178
Up!

01:04:30.341 --> 01:04:32.181
Up!

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:37.000
- Flealick?
- Huh?

01:04:37.182 --> 01:04:38.622
Flealick?

01:04:38.725 --> 01:04:40.525
Huh?

01:04:40.685 --> 01:04:42.605
Flealick!

01:04:42.771 --> 01:04:44.611
Can you... Can you hear me?

01:04:46.775 --> 01:04:48.615
Are you okay?

01:04:48.777 --> 01:04:52.017
Just flip me over.
Fl... Flip me over.

01:04:53.615 --> 01:04:56.255
Ah! Okay, okay. Whew!

01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:58.369
Feelin' good, feelin' peppy!

01:04:58.536 --> 01:05:00.456
They went... All right.
They went this way.

01:05:00.622 --> 01:05:04.022
Uh, actually, Flealick,
I think it's the other way.

01:05:04.209 --> 01:05:06.329
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:10.023
- It's all in the hooter. The schnozz.
- The what?

01:05:10.215 --> 01:05:13.095
- The olfactory instrument.
- Pig! Pig, pig! You're unraveling here!

01:05:13.259 --> 01:05:16.939
"A", they are long gone.
"B", they were not nice people.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:20.540
"C" is for kamikaze and "D" is for
delusional, which is what you are in the head!

01:05:20.725 --> 01:05:24.165
- Ferdy.
- Face it. You're just a little pig in the big city.

01:05:24.396 --> 01:05:29.076
What can you possibly do?
What can anyone do? Why even try?

01:05:33.238 --> 01:05:36.038
Huh?

01:05:40.578 --> 01:05:43.378
Would you help me off
with this, please?

01:05:43.581 --> 01:05:45.421
Oh, boy. Unbelievable.

01:05:49.504 --> 01:05:51.824
Hmm. Uh...

01:05:54.509 --> 01:05:58.549
Ferdinand the duck,
witness to insanity.

01:06:01.266 --> 01:06:03.146
"Chaos...

01:06:03.268 --> 01:06:04.828
revisited".
- re... revisited".

01:06:04.936 --> 01:06:06.816
Oops. Sorry.

01:06:10.942 --> 01:06:15.302
Sometimes we discover
our talents only through necessity.

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:20.292
Babe, who never used his nose for
anything but the piggish pursuit of food,

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:24.977
soon found he could make his way
through the trickiest of smellscapes.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:30.790
As the morning wore on,
he became quite the virtuoso.

01:06:31.004 --> 01:06:34.764
It's close.
It's close. We're getting close.

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:40.350
Yes, it's this way.

01:06:46.144 --> 01:06:48.024
Hmph!

01:06:48.146 --> 01:06:50.266
Tourists.

01:06:51.649 --> 01:06:54.449
I do believe we're here.

01:06:56.654 --> 01:06:59.014
Dr. Collins, please report to...

01:07:06.831 --> 01:07:08.671
Ohh.

01:07:24.391 --> 01:07:27.231
Dead. I knew it. They're all dead.

01:07:27.394 --> 01:07:30.034
- They're not dead.
- Well, let's go get 'em.

01:07:30.188 --> 01:07:35.628
Flealick, if we get caught,
we won't be able to help anybody.

01:07:35.902 --> 01:07:38.942
Oh, yes, I've given myself a good,
hard talking-to, let me tell you.

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:42.795
I said to myself, Esme, you have
let Arthur, yourself and the pig down.

01:07:43.034 --> 01:07:47.834
The judge had never heard anyone
speak so many words in so short a time.

01:07:48.123 --> 01:07:50.283
Evidently, this was a woman...

01:07:50.417 --> 01:07:52.697
of clear conscience and good intent.

01:07:52.877 --> 01:07:55.677
I used to dismiss pigs, but then a pig
became my husband's best friend.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:59.280
Besides, he grew up
on a farm and had a fondness for pigs.

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:01.349
You can bind me in chains,

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:04.031
but the minute I'm free I shall
march back into those streets...

01:08:04.222 --> 01:08:06.062
and search for my Arthur's pig!

01:08:06.224 --> 01:08:08.544
Case dismissed!

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:38.885
Hello? Hello?

01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:40.930
- It's the pinkness!
- All right!

01:08:41.091 --> 01:08:42.932
- Thingy!
- Chief!

01:08:43.094 --> 01:08:45.453
- Oh, I knew he'd come.
- Hot-diggety doggie-doo!

01:08:45.596 --> 01:08:48.277
- Shh! We have to be quiet.
- Sorry. Uh, sorry.

01:08:52.103 --> 01:08:54.023
- I'll go lock up.
- All right.

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:05.037
Okay, okay. You all know the term
"survival of the fastest".

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:08.041
Well, I've got an idea.
We split into two groups.

01:09:08.243 --> 01:09:11.044
The fast ones come with me. The slow
ones stay behind and sacrifice themselves.

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:13.287
- Ferdinand!
- That way we don't all die.

01:09:13.457 --> 01:09:15.337
I think that's only reasonable,
don't you?

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.340
Wh... Where's Thelonius?

01:09:18.796 --> 01:09:21.237
What are you doing?

01:09:21.424 --> 01:09:24.304
I, I'm not dressed.

01:09:24.469 --> 01:09:27.908
But, Thelonius,
you're an orangu-thingy.

01:09:28.139 --> 01:09:31.578
- Well, I'm not dressed.
- Mr. Thelonius?

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:33.569
Time to go.

01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:37.770
This is insanitary.

01:09:51.078 --> 01:09:52.559
Thank you for waiting.

01:10:00.713 --> 01:10:03.553
Quick, go back. Go back!

01:10:03.716 --> 01:10:05.596
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

01:10:27.782 --> 01:10:32.182
Oh, my. When is something
nice gonna happen to me?

01:10:32.412 --> 01:10:35.292
Oxygen. Oxygen.

01:10:45.717 --> 01:10:47.237
Hello?

01:10:53.808 --> 01:10:55.648
Hello?

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:13.207
Pig.

01:11:27.008 --> 01:11:29.328
What's going on?
What happened?

01:11:29.511 --> 01:11:32.311
I thought I could make a place
where we would all be okay.

01:11:32.514 --> 01:11:34.354
But how can you do that here?

01:11:34.516 --> 01:11:36.836
This used to be a lovely neighborhood.

01:11:37.018 --> 01:11:39.818
People kept an eye out for each other.
They really did.

01:11:40.021 --> 01:11:41.861
But now,
I'm away for just one night...

01:11:42.023 --> 01:11:44.343
with my Uncle Fugly on his deathbed...

01:11:44.526 --> 01:11:46.366
You poor, wee thing.

01:11:46.528 --> 01:11:49.648
Why couldn't they just leave us be?

01:11:49.864 --> 01:11:52.424
- Who?
- What did the animals ever do to her?

01:11:52.617 --> 01:11:54.857
- Who?
- Her! That...

01:11:57.247 --> 01:11:59.127
Her.

01:12:00.959 --> 01:12:02.839
Right.

01:12:02.961 --> 01:12:06.121
Clothes.
Got anything that'll fit me?

01:12:06.297 --> 01:12:08.497
Um, eh...

01:12:31.072 --> 01:12:34.072
Where are our animals?

01:12:43.835 --> 01:12:47.155
- I'm not going across there.
- Do it, Nigel.

01:12:47.338 --> 01:12:49.698
It's just a walk in the park.

01:12:49.841 --> 01:12:52.201
Try and use all of your legs.

01:12:52.343 --> 01:12:54.703
Come on, we're almost... not there.

01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:04.819
In this whole wide world,

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:06.821
is there anywhere that's truly safe?

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:08.823
Yeah, for my babies?

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:12.745
There is a place I know,
but it's ever so far away.

01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:15.029
How do we get there?

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:18.120
Well, first we have to find my human.

01:13:18.328 --> 01:13:20.168
Huh? Ohh!

01:13:23.416 --> 01:13:25.576
Darling?

01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:27.590
There you are.

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:44.919
- Quietly.
- Huh?

01:13:45.063 --> 01:13:46.943
- Quietly.
- "Quietly".

01:13:47.065 --> 01:13:48.945
Shh.

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:57.590
Four leg.
Two.

01:13:57.784 --> 01:14:01.704
This is a dog.
Mmm.

01:14:01.913 --> 01:14:03.833
And a pig.

01:14:09.504 --> 01:14:11.944
Hi, Thelonius.

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.240
Come on, Thelonius, come on.

01:14:40.368 --> 01:14:43.048
John? John?

01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:45.086
Mrs. Willis.

01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:47.088
Any pain?

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.090
- No, very little.
- Good.

01:14:50.962 --> 01:14:52.722
Good evening, Doctor.
Evening, sir.

01:14:52.881 --> 01:14:54.161
- Evening.
- Hello.

01:14:54.299 --> 01:14:56.139
Okay, thank you.
Have a good night.

01:15:21.659 --> 01:15:23.659
Evening.

01:15:23.828 --> 01:15:27.148
We're looking for, um, some animals.

01:15:27.332 --> 01:15:28.892
What kind?

01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:31.729
Pig, cats, dogs, monkeys,

01:15:32.504 --> 01:15:32.824
that sort of thing.

01:15:56.319 --> 01:15:59.039
Hey! You can't come in here.

01:16:05.578 --> 01:16:08.378
Pig!

01:16:12.794 --> 01:16:14.634
- Yaaaah!
- Ooohhh!

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:24.818
Well, bite my tail.

01:16:26.015 --> 01:16:28.895
This must be the fun.

01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:32.580
Oh. What a surprise.

01:16:32.772 --> 01:16:35.652
I adore surprises.

01:16:43.241 --> 01:16:46.321
Back off!

01:16:52.917 --> 01:16:54.517
Ohh! Ohh!

01:16:56.004 --> 01:16:58.564
Come here!

01:17:02.844 --> 01:17:05.284
Okay, go!

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:15.903
Pig?
Pig, pig, pig, pig!

01:17:16.066 --> 01:17:17.826
Whoa!

01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:21.190
It is her!
It's her!

01:17:21.362 --> 01:17:23.202
Sure, it's her.

01:17:23.364 --> 01:17:26.124
- Stay, pig, stay!
- But it looks like Himself!

01:17:26.284 --> 01:17:29.124
Thelonius, I don't think so.

01:17:29.287 --> 01:17:31.167
I tell you, it's Himself.

01:17:31.289 --> 01:17:33.329
- Things are lookin' up, Ferdy.
- Huh?

01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:35.338
You're comin' with me, Porky.

01:17:37.462 --> 01:17:41.422
- That's not your pig!
- He is my pig now.

01:17:41.633 --> 01:17:44.193
Esme!
The chef's got your pig!

01:18:02.946 --> 01:18:05.066
Okay, Thelonius, let's go.

01:18:08.284 --> 01:18:10.124
Oh.

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:12.126
Oh.

01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:14.128
Grab her, man!

01:18:21.339 --> 01:18:24.819
I am Esme Cordelia Hoggett...

01:18:25.009 --> 01:18:27.769
and I've come for my Arthur's pig!

01:18:37.021 --> 01:18:39.941
- Oh, dear! Ohh! Ohh!
- Whoa!

01:18:59.544 --> 01:19:01.864
Ohh!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:19:04.716 --> 01:19:08.276
Whoo!

01:19:17.228 --> 01:19:19.068
Isn't this appalling?

01:19:19.230 --> 01:19:22.190
Oh-Oh-Ohhhh! Ohhh!

01:19:24.069 --> 01:19:26.709
Ohh! Ooh! Sorry!

01:19:41.044 --> 01:19:42.604
Oh.

01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:50.630
Aaah! Aaaah!

01:19:50.762 --> 01:19:51.962
Aaaaah!

01:20:01.106 --> 01:20:04.306
Come on, Ferdy. Come on.

01:20:04.484 --> 01:20:07.244
Ohh! Come on, pig! Come on! Ohh!

01:20:07.445 --> 01:20:09.925
Ohh!

01:20:15.995 --> 01:20:18.755
Ohh!

01:20:21.418 --> 01:20:24.018
I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:20:26.506 --> 01:20:29.466
Grab him!

01:21:16.181 --> 01:21:17.461
Pig!

01:21:17.599 --> 01:21:19.359
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:21:57.972 --> 01:22:00.092
No.

01:22:00.225 --> 01:22:02.105
What, honey? What's wrong?

01:22:02.227 --> 01:22:04.867
- I think I dropped a baby.
- What do you mean, you dropped a baby?

01:22:05.063 --> 01:22:06.903
I must have dropped the other baby.

01:22:07.065 --> 01:22:09.785
Oh, Zootie!
Calm down. Calm down.

01:22:09.984 --> 01:22:14.464
Zootie, don't worry, honey. We'll find
the baby. The baby has to be right here.

01:22:14.739 --> 01:22:17.779
- Hello?
- Oh, my baby!

01:22:19.828 --> 01:22:22.268
Thelonius, look! Look up!

01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:54.450
Thank you.

01:22:54.612 --> 01:22:56.492
Yeah, Thelonius. Thank you.

01:22:59.451 --> 01:23:01.291
Thank the pig.

01:23:09.002 --> 01:23:12.602
Pig, you get here now!

01:23:17.927 --> 01:23:21.487
You can't always
put things back together as they were,

01:23:21.723 --> 01:23:24.163
but you can look to something afresh.

01:23:24.309 --> 01:23:27.149
At least,
that's what the two ladies decided.

01:23:29.814 --> 01:23:32.814
So it was, the hotel was rented out.

01:23:32.984 --> 01:23:35.824
And this provided
for a curious arrangement.

01:23:35.987 --> 01:23:39.947
I just can't stand it anymore!
Roger! Roger!

01:23:47.957 --> 01:23:50.037
The money from the hotel...

01:23:50.168 --> 01:23:52.688
allowed the Hoggetts
to keep the farm from the bank.

01:23:52.837 --> 01:23:56.197
Race you home, Alan.

01:23:56.382 --> 01:23:57.822
You betcha, Nigel.

01:24:01.054 --> 01:24:05.174
And so it was,
the pig brought the two worlds together.

01:24:05.391 --> 01:24:08.631
Two broken halves
to make something afresh...

01:24:08.853 --> 01:24:12.413
in a place just a little to the left
of the 20th century.

01:24:20.281 --> 01:24:23.681
The chimpanzees
left show business behind...

01:24:23.868 --> 01:24:27.708
and were able to be chimpanzees.

01:24:27.914 --> 01:24:32.554
As you would expect,
the air agreed with them immeasurably.

01:24:32.836 --> 01:24:35.916
Although the others
got a taste for country life,

01:24:36.089 --> 01:24:39.449
Flealick found the pace too slow...

01:24:39.676 --> 01:24:41.516
and took to chasing trucks.

01:24:45.056 --> 01:24:47.616
- Are you lonesome tonight
- Sad to say,

01:24:47.767 --> 01:24:51.607
the thing between the pit bull
and pink poodle didn't last.

01:24:51.855 --> 01:24:55.095
She ran off with another dog
and left him with the kids.

01:24:55.316 --> 01:24:59.476
Kids, you got to be scary.
You're warriors. Give me your snarl.

01:24:59.737 --> 01:25:02.817
But, Dad, do we have to?

01:25:03.032 --> 01:25:05.672
We don't want to.

01:25:08.872 --> 01:25:10.832
When I kissed you

01:25:10.999 --> 01:25:15.199
And called you sweetheart

01:25:16.546 --> 01:25:20.146
Do the chairs in your parlor

01:25:20.383 --> 01:25:22.223
Seem empty and bare

01:25:22.385 --> 01:25:24.905
As for the orangutan,

01:25:25.096 --> 01:25:28.496
he insisted on staying
at the farmhouse... with Herself.

01:25:28.725 --> 01:25:32.205
And picture me there

01:25:32.437 --> 01:25:36.237
Is your heart filled with pain

01:25:36.441 --> 01:25:40.121
Shall I come back again

01:25:40.361 --> 01:25:42.081
Tell me, dear

01:25:42.238 --> 01:25:44.358
Are you lonesome

01:25:44.491 --> 01:25:46.451
Tonight

01:26:01.132 --> 01:26:04.372
And finally, dear ones,
the pig and the farmer...

01:26:04.594 --> 01:26:07.754
were content again
in each other's company.

01:26:07.972 --> 01:26:13.452
And things were back
to where they started, more or less.

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.120
Hmm.

01:26:59.691 --> 01:27:02.731
That'll do, pig.

01:27:02.902 --> 01:27:04.622
That'll do.

01:27:13.955 --> 01:27:18.675
A kind and steady heart

01:27:18.918 --> 01:27:23.078
Can make a gray sky blue

01:27:23.339 --> 01:27:27.259
And a task that seems impossible

01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:32.670
Is quite possible for you

01:27:32.974 --> 01:27:37.254
A kind and steady heart

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:42.000
Is sure to see you through

01:27:42.233 --> 01:27:47.033
It may not seem
like very much right now

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:51.920
But it'll do, it'll do

01:27:52.202 --> 01:27:56.442
When you find yourself
in the middle of a storm

01:27:56.706 --> 01:28:01.026
And you're tired and cold and wet

01:28:01.252 --> 01:28:04.972
And you're looking for a place
that's cozy and warm

01:28:05.215 --> 01:28:10.455
You'll make it if you never forget

01:28:10.762 --> 01:28:14.922
A kind and steady heart

01:28:15.141 --> 01:28:20.421
Can conquer doubt and fear

01:28:20.730 --> 01:28:24.930
A little courage
goes a long, long way

01:28:25.151 --> 01:28:30.631
Gets you little bit further
down the road each day

01:28:30.949 --> 01:28:36.549
And before you know it
you'll hear someone say

01:28:36.871 --> 01:28:40.031
That'll do, Babe

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:42.090
That'll do

01:28:59.686 --> 01:29:04.006
A kind and steady heart

01:29:04.274 --> 01:29:08.954
Is sure to see you through

01:29:09.195 --> 01:29:13.875
A little courage
goes a long, long way

01:29:14.159 --> 01:29:19.799
Gets you little bit further
down the road each day

01:29:20.123 --> 01:29:27.203
And before you know it
you'll hear someone say

01:29:27.547 --> 01:29:30.947
That'll do

01:29:31.176 --> 01:29:34.456
That'll do

01:29:34.679 --> 01:29:38.599
That'll do, Babe

01:29:38.850 --> 01:29:40.570
That'll do

01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:41.069
Thank you for staying till the end.

01:35:41.254 --> 01:35:43.134
Bye-bye.
