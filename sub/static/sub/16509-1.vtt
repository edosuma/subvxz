01:43.355 --> 01:44.314
Hmmmm

01:45.566 --> 01:47.651
What a lovely dream.

01:49.027 --> 01:50.028
Hello?

01:50.779 --> 01:52.531
What is this place?

01:53.949 --> 01:56.034
Hey, who's that? Ow!

02:12.259 --> 02:13.135
Hello.

02:15.095 --> 02:17.931
Be patient, little buzzer,
it's still too early.

02:18.140 --> 02:20.392
But I have to tell you
about my dream.

02:20.601 --> 02:23.270
There was this big,
bright round yellow thing.

02:23.478 --> 02:25.147
And all this blue.

02:25.355 --> 02:27.649
- Bees don't dream.
-Why?

02:27.858 --> 02:29.067
Well...

02:29.901 --> 02:31.361
They just don't.

02:31.570 --> 02:34.323
Now rest. Bees never
hatch until the sun rises

02:34.531 --> 02:35.741
over the daffodils.

02:35.949 --> 02:37.618
Why can't I just
do what I want?

02:37.826 --> 02:39.703
A bee do what she wants?

02:39.911 --> 02:41.038
Oh...

02:43.123 --> 02:44.207
Patience, little bee.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.545
There's plenty of time
for learning later.

02:48.754 --> 02:51.423
- What's a bee?
-A bee is a good little girl

02:51.632 --> 02:53.133
who does what she's told.

02:53.342 --> 02:55.469
<i>Rock-a-bye bay-bee,</i>

02:55.677 --> 02:57.638
<i>in her wax nest.</i>

02:57.846 --> 03:00.390
<i>When nursie</i> says,

03:00.599 --> 03:02.142
<i>bay-bee will rest.</i>

03:02.351 --> 03:03.852
<i>Good baby,</i>

03:04.061 --> 03:05.646
<i>go to sleep...</i>

03:05.854 --> 03:07.564
That's enough, little one.

03:07.773 --> 03:09.191
Hey!

03:09.399 --> 03:10.651
In you go.

03:11.943 --> 03:15.364
A bee who does what she wants?
Ridiculous!

03:17.282 --> 03:19.701
- What are we making?
-How...?

03:19.910 --> 03:20.994
Now listen here!

03:21.203 --> 03:22.329
We're not going
to tell you again.

03:22.537 --> 03:24.831
Go. Back. In.

03:28.377 --> 03:29.461
There...

03:29.670 --> 03:31.380
Everything is fine.

03:33.965 --> 03:36.760
- What a sweet little bee.
-Sweet?

03:36.968 --> 03:38.512
Now, what was her name?

03:38.720 --> 03:41.682
Baby-Bee 396.

03:41.890 --> 03:43.433
396.

03:44.309 --> 03:45.018
Maya.

03:46.019 --> 03:48.146
She's where she belongs now.

04:02.703 --> 04:04.121
Wow!

04:08.959 --> 04:11.378
Hello, busy bees!

04:15.716 --> 04:17.134
What is this?

04:19.678 --> 04:22.597
- This is fun.
-Bees don't have fun.

04:22.806 --> 04:23.765
Get off.

04:27.144 --> 04:29.062
Help! I can't see!

04:32.232 --> 04:34.526
- Excuse me!
-Hey, what?!

04:37.237 --> 04:39.614
I can't see.
I can't see.

04:39.823 --> 04:41.199
I don't want to see!

04:42.367 --> 04:44.828
Listen to that buzz,
Your Majesty.

04:45.036 --> 04:47.497
That's the sound
of good little bees

04:47.706 --> 04:50.250
keeping this
great hive efficient.

04:55.881 --> 04:57.799
This was so fun!
Did you see?

04:58.008 --> 05:01.094
I was all the way up there,
then I was like, “Bzzz!”

05:01.303 --> 05:02.554
Miss Big Bee,

05:02.763 --> 05:04.014
you've got something
on your head.

05:04.222 --> 05:05.766
- Is it heavy?
-Silence!

05:05.974 --> 05:09.478
Clean this up! This is a hive,
not a filthy hornet's nest.

05:09.686 --> 05:13.398
Pull your stinger in, Buzzlina.
She's just a baby.

05:13.607 --> 05:15.484
I'm sure it was an accident.

05:15.692 --> 05:17.152
If we allow bees to run amuck

05:17.360 --> 05:19.529
like this the hive
will fall into chaos.

05:19.738 --> 05:22.240
She is right.
Every bee in this hive

05:22.449 --> 05:25.160
-has a role to play.
-What's my role?

05:25.368 --> 05:28.205
Patience, little one.
You'll find your place.

05:28.413 --> 05:30.999
You just need to learn how
everything works first.

05:31.208 --> 05:34.628
But she broke the rules.
She must be punished!

05:34.836 --> 05:38.089
See that she gets to
school safely, Buzzlina.

05:38.298 --> 05:40.842
Of course,
Your Majesty.

05:41.051 --> 05:43.220
"Every bee has
a role to play..."

05:45.013 --> 05:47.432
We must do something
about the Queen, Crawley.

05:47.641 --> 05:49.935
She's not fit to rule this hive.

05:50.143 --> 05:52.395
Right, you little menace...

06:04.533 --> 06:05.700
Hey!

06:09.538 --> 06:11.581
- Halt.
-Halt!

06:11.790 --> 06:15.961
- What kind of bee are you?
-A marchy bee, like you, silly.

06:16.169 --> 06:19.422
I hardly think so.
Bees don't behave like that.

06:19.631 --> 06:21.716
Fall in, soldier!

06:21.925 --> 06:22.801
Shoo.

06:37.315 --> 06:38.733
Attention!

06:44.322 --> 06:45.991
Attention!

07:07.971 --> 07:09.723
Wow.

07:27.782 --> 07:30.994
Whoa. Beautiful.

07:52.140 --> 07:55.185
<i>Like a maple tree
in the fall...</i>

07:55.393 --> 07:56.353
Oh, no.

07:56.561 --> 07:58.313
Too syrupy-

07:58.521 --> 08:01.399
Oh, so many colors!

08:01.608 --> 08:05.070
Yes!
Simple! To the point!

08:05.278 --> 08:06.863
<i>So many colors...</i>

08:07.072 --> 08:10.742
<i>Nothing is as dull as
staying inside</i>

08:10.951 --> 08:12.410
Kid, that's great.

08:12.619 --> 08:15.330
Where did you learn to write
songs like that? Hee-hop!

08:15.538 --> 08:18.124
It's like you're seeing the
world for the first time.

08:18.333 --> 08:21.044
You've got music in you, little
buzzer, and what goes in...

08:21.252 --> 08:22.212
"Laaaa!"

08:22.420 --> 08:25.006
must come out.
Come on, try it.

08:25.215 --> 08:26.424
"Laaaa!"

08:26.633 --> 08:28.176
"La-l,

08:28.385 --> 08:30.220
"Laaaa!"

08:31.805 --> 08:35.100
"LaaaaaaaaP'

08:36.433 --> 08:38.561
Uh,yeah.
Save some for later.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.484
- You're a funny green bee.
-Green bee?

08:46.403 --> 08:49.572
You are seeing the world
for the first time!

08:49.781 --> 08:50.949
Pardon me, little miss.

08:51.157 --> 08:53.159
Flip the grasshopper
is my name.

08:53.368 --> 08:54.869
Roaming the meadow
is my game.

08:55.078 --> 08:56.246
What's the meadow?

08:57.205 --> 08:58.331
What's the meadow?

08:58.540 --> 09:00.709
Kid, you got to get out more.
Hee-hop!

09:03.837 --> 09:05.505
There it is.

09:07.132 --> 09:10.719
The meadow...
my home.

09:10.927 --> 09:12.429
You live out here?

09:12.637 --> 09:15.390
Not just me. Lots of insects
live in the meadow.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.559
Big, small, funny, smelly.

09:17.767 --> 09:20.061
You name it.
It's everything you can see.

09:20.270 --> 09:24.024
Up, down, sky to ground from
your hive to the tulip beds,

09:24.232 --> 09:26.860
all the way
to Gorgo's hedge.

09:27.068 --> 09:30.613
Where no little bee
should ever go.

09:30.822 --> 09:31.906
Why?

09:32.115 --> 09:33.867
Because a giant
bug-eating monster

09:34.075 --> 09:35.660
<i>named Gorge fives there.</i>

09:35.869 --> 09:38.329
But enough of that!
Where are your friends?

09:38.538 --> 09:40.040
Bees always travel in groups.

09:40.248 --> 09:42.459
I don't think
I have any friends.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.294
No one in the hive likes me.

09:45.420 --> 09:47.797
Maybe I'm just
bad at being a bee.

09:48.006 --> 09:49.632
Sounds serious.

09:49.841 --> 09:52.844
Hey! Hey, what are you--

09:53.053 --> 09:55.096
Do not disturb the
great Dr. Flippenstein.

09:55.305 --> 09:57.098
You got a good heart, kid.
Say "Ah".

09:57.307 --> 09:58.183
Ah.

09:58.391 --> 10:00.643
What do you know?
Bees do have teeth.

10:00.852 --> 10:02.395
Beeswax... Promising.

10:04.022 --> 10:08.568
In my professional opinion,
the diagnosis is bee positive.

10:08.777 --> 10:10.236
You're a good
little buzzer, kid.

10:10.445 --> 10:13.406
Don't let anyone
say otherwise.

10:13.615 --> 10:16.034
Maybe we should get you
back to the hive, little one.

10:16.242 --> 10:18.078
No, Flip, can't I stay?

10:19.913 --> 10:21.206
Hee-hop!

10:28.379 --> 10:30.215
Approaching marigold
coordinates.

10:30.423 --> 10:33.259
Commence pollen
collection procedure.

10:51.861 --> 10:52.779
What is it?

10:54.614 --> 10:56.157
Hornets!

10:56.366 --> 10:58.243
Hold on to your buckets!

11:04.415 --> 11:06.584
Why so shy?

11:10.463 --> 11:12.465
Well, well, well.

11:12.674 --> 11:15.301
What do we got here?
Greedy little fluff-balls

11:15.510 --> 11:17.846
nabbing all the pollen
for themselves.

11:18.054 --> 11:19.597
Hold onto your buckets!

11:19.806 --> 11:21.266
Thieving buzz boxes about!

11:21.474 --> 11:24.185
Take that back, you
hoity toity hivecrawler.

11:24.394 --> 11:26.563
Hornets don't steal.

11:26.771 --> 11:29.524
Go back where you came from,
pollen-pinchers.

11:29.732 --> 11:32.694
We're shaking in our shells.

11:32.902 --> 11:34.821
Lucky for you
I've got a camp to set up.

11:35.029 --> 11:37.866
See you around... neighbor.

11:41.911 --> 11:43.955
There goes the neighborhood.

11:46.875 --> 11:49.002
Hey, my bucket's gone.

11:49.210 --> 11:52.422
- You see? Dirty thieves.
-Back to the hive!

11:52.630 --> 11:54.465
We need to report
this to the Queen.

11:54.674 --> 11:56.009
Oh dear.

11:59.637 --> 12:01.431
No, Flip-Bug, can't I stay?

12:01.639 --> 12:02.765
It's all so big

12:02.974 --> 12:05.852
and sunshiney out here,
and it smells so nice.

12:06.060 --> 12:08.646
Here you go, little buzzer.
I've got to hop.

12:08.855 --> 12:10.732
Bees don't like other bugs
hanging around the hive.

12:10.940 --> 12:13.234
- No, I want to stay!
-Don't worry,

12:14.819 --> 12:16.571
you'll see it again soon.

12:17.614 --> 12:20.116
- Really?
-Sure! Flowers and bees

12:20.325 --> 12:22.911
go together
like spiders and legs.

12:23.119 --> 12:25.872
But if you really want the
low-down on the meadow,

12:26.080 --> 12:28.750
you just call old Flip.
You can find me...

12:28.958 --> 12:30.793
Bees don't talk to other bugs!

12:30.960 --> 12:33.129
It wasn't another bug,
he was Flip.

12:33.338 --> 12:35.215
See you next time.
Hee-hop!

12:35.423 --> 12:37.926
Wait!
Flip, I want to go with you.

12:38.134 --> 12:41.804
Bees don't leave the hive
on their own. Now back to work!

12:42.013 --> 12:45.350
"Bees don't, bees never,
working bees, blah-blah-blah..."

12:45.558 --> 12:47.185
Bugs!

13:05.578 --> 13:08.665
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

13:21.886 --> 13:23.805
As Royal Adviser,

13:24.013 --> 13:27.517
I must strongly advise you
to repel the hornets.

13:27.725 --> 13:29.394
But they did not attack us.

13:29.602 --> 13:31.980
Well, no, not yet.

13:32.188 --> 13:34.399
But if we let them
set up camp,

13:34.607 --> 13:36.985
all the other
hornet tribes will follow.

13:37.193 --> 13:39.320
They'll surely
turn our meadow

13:39.529 --> 13:41.614
into a big
horrible hornet's nest.

13:41.823 --> 13:44.617
They'll kill all the flowers
and bugs. And then...

13:44.826 --> 13:47.870
Oh, and then
they'll eat us.

13:48.079 --> 13:50.832
We must show them
who's in charge.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.335
I am in charge,
remember?

13:54.544 --> 13:56.587
Your Majesty...

14:01.926 --> 14:06.139
That's all of it, Your Majesty.
This year's royal jelly harvest.

14:11.769 --> 14:14.230
Crawley, what's the problem?

14:14.439 --> 14:16.566
It appears to be blocked,
Your Adviseyness.

14:16.774 --> 14:18.693
Of course it's blocked.
Unblock it.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.945
- Me? But...
-Just do it.

14:21.154 --> 14:22.488
Of course, Ma'am.

14:29.078 --> 14:30.663
The royal jelly!

14:33.499 --> 14:35.168
That smells yummy.

14:35.376 --> 14:38.296
"Yummy?" Do you realize
what you almost did?

14:38.504 --> 14:40.840
This is a year's
supply of royal jelly, child.

14:41.049 --> 14:43.384
The Queen's life depends on it.

14:43.593 --> 14:45.887
She can't eat anything else.

14:46.095 --> 14:49.932
She can't eat anything else...

14:50.141 --> 14:51.225
Crawley...

14:51.434 --> 14:53.978
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

14:54.187 --> 14:56.230
Ladybugs aren't always ladies?

14:56.439 --> 14:59.984
I'm thinking this royal
jelly is the answer to our

15:00.193 --> 15:03.446
little problem
with the Queen.

15:03.654 --> 15:07.075
- I'm sorry, Miss Queen.
-My, that was quite an entrance.

15:07.283 --> 15:09.327
- Are you all right, my dear?
-Oh, yes.

15:09.535 --> 15:12.455
The flower-fluff was very soft.
And tasty.

15:16.876 --> 15:18.920
You're a wild one, aren't you?

15:19.128 --> 15:22.590
I can see I'm going to have
to keep an eye on you.

15:22.799 --> 15:24.175
Which eye, Miss Queen?

15:24.384 --> 15:26.552
Silence!
I told you to behave.

15:26.761 --> 15:29.764
And I told you to
take her to school.

15:31.015 --> 15:33.893
Er... of course, Your Majesty.

15:34.102 --> 15:35.520
Buzz, buzz, Buzzlina.

15:37.188 --> 15:38.815
You!school

15:44.153 --> 15:46.406
The meadow
isn't all flowers and sunshine.

15:46.614 --> 15:49.575
There are dangers, too.
Like hornets.

15:49.784 --> 15:52.537
Hornets!
Hide, everyone!

15:54.539 --> 15:55.873
Hornets!

15:59.293 --> 16:01.712
- What was that?
-Oh, Willi!

16:01.921 --> 16:03.673
How will you ever
recognise a hornet

16:03.881 --> 16:05.466
if you're always
asleep in my class?

16:05.675 --> 16:08.511
Me? No, no, no.
That was just my eyes.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.012
They take a break sometimes.

16:11.764 --> 16:15.518
Stop that infernal racket.
Bees don't sing!

16:15.726 --> 16:16.936
But Why?

16:17.145 --> 16:19.397
Because singing
leads to playing,

16:19.605 --> 16:23.234
and playing leads to laziness.
And a lazy bee!

16:23.443 --> 16:25.319
<i>Gorge, the bee-munching</i>

16:25.528 --> 16:28.156
hedge-monster,
just loves lazy bees.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.617
<i>Gorge...</i>

16:32.869 --> 16:35.872
Thank you for that
colorful description.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.708
- We've been expecting you, Maya.
-Maya?

16:38.916 --> 16:40.960
Well, yes... That's your name.

16:41.169 --> 16:42.295
Really?

16:42.503 --> 16:44.046
Maya.

16:44.255 --> 16:45.798
I like that.

16:46.007 --> 16:47.300
Maya.

16:47.508 --> 16:50.178
Maya.
Maya the Bee.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.848
Come along, little one.
Take a seat.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.516
A word, Buzzlina.

16:55.725 --> 16:57.310
What are you doing?

16:57.518 --> 16:58.936
Sitting next to you.

16:59.145 --> 17:01.397
But nobody ever sits next to me.

17:01.606 --> 17:04.817
I mean, excellent choice,
Maya. I'm Willi.

17:05.026 --> 17:07.528
Stick with me.
I know lots of things.

17:07.737 --> 17:10.031
This is my third First Flight
coming up, you know.

17:10.239 --> 17:14.493
Wow.
You must know everything.

17:14.702 --> 17:16.704
You're not like any
other bee I've met.

17:18.247 --> 17:21.000
- I keep hearing that.
-No, no, no.

17:21.209 --> 17:22.752
I meant that
in a good way.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.088
- We can be First Flight buddies.
-I'd like that!

17:26.297 --> 17:28.883
Miss Teaching Bee, when do
we go on our First Flight?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.593
SHence,396!

17:30.801 --> 17:32.595
My name is Maya.

17:34.138 --> 17:35.515
Patience, Maya.

17:35.723 --> 17:37.767
You must learn
about the dangers first.

17:37.975 --> 17:39.644
We were just talking
about hornets.

17:39.852 --> 17:41.020
What's a hornet?

17:41.229 --> 17:43.814
Why, just a
bee's worst enemy.

17:44.023 --> 17:45.942
Great big scaly things,

17:46.150 --> 17:49.403
with giant claws
and red eyes.

17:49.612 --> 17:51.697
They like nothing more

17:51.906 --> 17:55.743
than dipping baby-bees
in pollen dust for their supper.

17:57.370 --> 17:59.372
They change into horrible,

17:59.580 --> 18:01.916
howling beasts at night.

18:03.292 --> 18:06.504
Their disgusting fuzz
hides parasites

18:06.712 --> 18:09.382
that are trained
to attack hornets.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.801
And if you let them get close,

18:12.009 --> 18:16.305
they'll suck your soul
right out of your body.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.020
Sorry.

18:24.188 --> 18:27.275
Son, you're not going to cry,
are you?

18:27.483 --> 18:30.194
I haven't raised a
bee-baby, have I?

18:30.403 --> 18:32.321
Dad, I hate bees.

18:32.530 --> 18:34.490
That's my boy.

18:34.699 --> 18:36.450
Play safe and stay in camp.

18:36.659 --> 18:38.452
Bees roam all
over these parts.

18:38.661 --> 18:39.870
Dad, no fair!

18:40.079 --> 18:42.623
I want to see one of
those dirty soul-suckers.

18:42.832 --> 18:44.250
Maybe when
you're bigger, son.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.960
- I am big.
-Look what you've done!

18:46.168 --> 18:47.837
- I barely touched it!
-That's the third time today!

18:51.465 --> 18:54.719
By my shiny shell!
Stay where I can see you, son.

18:54.927 --> 18:56.887
- But, Dad...
-No buts!

18:57.096 --> 18:58.639
I said stay in camp.

18:58.848 --> 19:01.225
- Look what you did .
-Move your pincers, lazy bugs!

19:01.434 --> 19:04.020
I want this camp
up by nightfall!

19:04.228 --> 19:06.939
I'm big enough. Hey!
Who wants to join my secret

19:07.148 --> 19:08.441
Bug Hunters' Club?

19:09.609 --> 19:12.570
Scaredy bugs.
I'll go on my own, then!

19:15.698 --> 19:17.325
And remember, children,

19:17.533 --> 19:20.119
bugs eat bees and
they don't say please.

19:20.328 --> 19:23.956
And that's why we don't trust
any other bugs. Ever.

19:24.165 --> 19:25.416
But what if they're your friend

19:25.625 --> 19:27.043
or they're really,
really pretty?

19:27.251 --> 19:28.711
Or you need their help?

19:28.919 --> 19:32.256
I would rather die
than ask another bug for help.

19:32.465 --> 19:34.008
Isn't that kind of silly?

19:35.885 --> 19:37.762
I guess it is.

19:39.096 --> 19:40.431
Miss Cassandra!

19:41.432 --> 19:43.059
I'm warning you, 396.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.061
No more interruptions.

19:45.269 --> 19:46.854
Something you want to say,

19:47.063 --> 19:48.689
-396?
-Uh-uh!

19:48.898 --> 19:50.816
Good.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.155
But I just met a nice bug
and he didn't eat me.

19:56.364 --> 19:57.865
How can the meadow be
so bad when it's so pretty?

19:58.074 --> 19:59.033
That doesn't
even make sense.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.826
And really, why are
hornets so awful

20:01.035 --> 20:02.036
if you haven't even
met them either?

20:02.244 --> 20:03.412
And who is Gorgo, anyway?

20:03.621 --> 20:05.414
Why can't I laugh or dance
or play or leave the hive

20:05.623 --> 20:06.707
when it feels so good?

20:06.916 --> 20:08.834
Just because of some dumb
old crinkle face who's

20:09.001 --> 20:10.294
a funny looking bee
and won't even

20:10.503 --> 20:12.672
-let you si-ing?
-Uh-oh.

20:15.174 --> 20:19.136
That's it!
You're banned from First Flight.

20:19.345 --> 20:21.222
And all other flights.

20:24.517 --> 20:26.852
Follow me, children.
Stay close.

20:27.061 --> 20:29.563
And remember to
flap those wings.

20:40.116 --> 20:41.992
Hey, what are
you doing here?

20:42.201 --> 20:44.370
Why aren't you
out with the others?

20:44.578 --> 20:47.039
I couldn't leave
you alone, could I?

20:48.874 --> 20:51.752
Oh, Willi,
you're my best friend ever.

20:51.961 --> 20:53.504
You're the best.

20:53.713 --> 20:55.840
And you're my first friend ever.

20:56.048 --> 20:58.092
- Huh?
-Nothing. Nothing.

21:02.888 --> 21:05.057
What's wrong with me, Willi?

21:05.266 --> 21:08.561
- Why don't I fit into this hive?
-Fitting in is easy.

21:08.769 --> 21:11.188
Just stop asking questions
and follow orders.

21:11.397 --> 21:13.149
That's what the rest of us do.

21:13.357 --> 21:15.276
Of course, then you
wouldn't be crazy,

21:15.484 --> 21:17.236
funny Maya anymore.

21:17.445 --> 21:20.030
You'll be like every
other buzzer.

21:20.239 --> 21:23.492
You're right, Willi.
I'm the problem, not the hive!

21:23.701 --> 21:25.745
I have to tell
the Royal Adviser.

21:25.953 --> 21:28.122
From now on,
I'll do as I'm told.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.583
Maybe don't say
that it was my idea.

21:30.791 --> 21:33.544
- Maya'>
-She's '

21:33.753 --> 21:34.920
Crawley?

21:35.129 --> 21:37.882
Crawley, you sniveling sneak,
show yourself.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.426
Here I am,
Your Advisorness.

21:40.634 --> 21:41.761
Is it done?

21:41.969 --> 21:43.095
Of course.

21:46.974 --> 21:48.434
Dear me, Crawley.

21:48.642 --> 21:52.688
You know, I think the hornets
have stolen the royal jelly.

21:52.897 --> 21:55.858
But isn't that the royal jelly?

21:56.066 --> 21:59.320
We must find the dirty thieves
and destroy their camp.

21:59.528 --> 22:00.613
Mustn't we?

22:01.572 --> 22:03.657
But they didn't steal it.

22:03.866 --> 22:05.159
- We--
-I know they didn't!

22:05.367 --> 22:07.995
But the others don't know that,
do they, Crawley?

22:12.583 --> 22:15.044
- There you are, Miss Adviser...
-396?

22:15.252 --> 22:16.837
I came to say...

22:17.046 --> 22:18.839
What are you doing
with the royal jelly?

22:19.048 --> 22:20.508
Silence! I warned you!

22:20.716 --> 22:22.134
Bees don't ask questions.

22:22.343 --> 22:23.803
- Get out!
-Wait, Miss Advisorness.

22:24.011 --> 22:25.012
You were right.

22:25.221 --> 22:27.890
- I have to learn all your rules.
-impossible.

22:28.098 --> 22:30.267
There's no place in this hive
for troublemakers.

22:30.476 --> 22:31.894
No, I can change.

22:32.102 --> 22:35.022
- I promise I'll try.
-Forget it, 396.

22:35.231 --> 22:36.941
You don't belong here.

22:37.149 --> 22:39.985
You are banished
from this hive.

22:40.194 --> 22:43.197
Banished...
But where will I go?

22:43.405 --> 22:47.493
It's the meadow for
wretched little bugs like you.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.411
Good, I like bugs!

22:49.620 --> 22:52.706
They're a lot nicer
than you, you big bully!

22:52.915 --> 22:54.792
Then go, 396.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.336
I'm sure there's a
meadow full of bugs

22:57.545 --> 22:59.797
just waiting to meet you.

23:01.298 --> 23:02.967
Or eat you.

23:05.928 --> 23:07.638
Mean old bully bee.

23:07.847 --> 23:08.973
I'll show you.

23:09.181 --> 23:12.017
There's a place for me
out here somewhere.

23:26.323 --> 23:27.408
Okay"-...

23:36.792 --> 23:37.751
Maya?

23:45.301 --> 23:47.219
Hey! I'm flying!

23:52.725 --> 23:56.395
But I don't think little bees
can survive out in the meadow.

23:56.604 --> 23:58.063
Exactly.

23:58.272 --> 24:03.777
Go after her and see
that nature takes its course.

24:03.986 --> 24:05.279
Oh, no.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.407
You have to save her, Willi.
No. She'll be all right.

24:08.616 --> 24:11.327
No, she won't.
Just do it.

24:11.535 --> 24:14.580
Maya!
Wait, Maya!

24:14.788 --> 24:15.748
Maya!

24:52.076 --> 24:54.203
Hello, meadow!
I'm here.

24:55.913 --> 24:58.165
Oh, a shiny plant.

24:58.374 --> 25:00.209
Hey, that's not nice.

25:26.485 --> 25:29.613
I'm coming to save you, Maya.

25:29.822 --> 25:31.073
Willi?

25:47.256 --> 25:49.383
Don't worry. Willi's here.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.385
It's me, Willi!

25:51.593 --> 25:53.762
Maya.
What are you doing out here?

25:53.971 --> 25:57.558
I've left the hive, Willi,
and I'm never ever coming back.

25:57.766 --> 26:00.436
Yeah, right. Right.
Good one.

26:00.644 --> 26:01.353
You what?!

26:02.688 --> 26:05.149
The Royal Adviser says
I don't belong there.

26:05.357 --> 26:10.320
But so far I haven't been doing
so well out here, either.

26:10.529 --> 26:13.782
I don't think I fit
in anywhere, Willi.

26:13.991 --> 26:15.909
Maya, you're a bee.

26:16.118 --> 26:17.536
Bees live in hives.

26:17.745 --> 26:19.121
Even I know that.

26:19.329 --> 26:21.206
You can't survive out here
on your own.

26:21.415 --> 26:23.375
Well, I'm not on
my own now.

26:23.584 --> 26:25.210
Oh, great!
That's just great.

26:25.419 --> 26:26.879
We'll both get eaten!

26:27.087 --> 26:28.172
- Flip!
"No!

26:28.380 --> 26:30.215
Now you're flipping out on me?

26:30.424 --> 26:33.343
No.
Flip the crazy grass jumper.

26:33.552 --> 26:35.345
He knows how to
live in the meadow.

26:35.554 --> 26:37.014
He can show me where I fit in.

26:37.222 --> 26:39.016
I'm not going back
out there in the dark.

26:39.224 --> 26:41.226
We'll have to wait
until the morning.

26:43.270 --> 26:46.190
If we get eaten tonight,
I'll never forgive you.

26:54.740 --> 26:57.284
Did the frogs get her?

26:57.493 --> 26:59.411
Of course, Ma'am.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.205
Exceflent

27:05.542 --> 27:07.669
Maya? Willi?

27:09.546 --> 27:10.964
Kids!

27:22.768 --> 27:24.895
Grub, leaf, rock.

27:25.104 --> 27:26.480
Leaf covers rock.

27:26.688 --> 27:27.940
You learn quickly.

27:28.148 --> 27:30.818
- Grub, leaf, rock.
-I win again.

27:31.026 --> 27:33.821
Nom, nom, nom.
Caterpillar eats your leaf.

27:34.029 --> 27:36.490
You look outside first.

27:36.698 --> 27:40.285
Well, I would have looked first
even if I had won.

27:40.494 --> 27:42.538
That's just the
kind of bee I am.

27:48.127 --> 27:50.420
- What is it, Willi?
-A monster.

27:50.629 --> 27:54.049
With big eyes and fangs,
ready to eat us.

27:57.553 --> 27:58.804
How pretty.

27:59.012 --> 28:00.597
Are you sure
that's a monster, Willi?

28:00.806 --> 28:03.934
Is it gone? Don't worry.
I shooed it away.

28:04.143 --> 28:07.938
- With an attack shriek.
-Thank you, my protector.

28:08.147 --> 28:12.192
So where is this flippity
grass jumper of yours?

28:12.401 --> 28:14.403
Somewhere in the meadow.

28:14.611 --> 28:15.904
That narrows it down.

28:16.113 --> 28:19.408
I guess we'll need to ask
some bugs for directions.

28:19.616 --> 28:22.661
Maya...
You're so going to get us eaten.

28:25.539 --> 28:27.082
Son!

28:27.291 --> 28:30.335
Son? Son!

28:30.544 --> 28:31.879
Son?

28:32.087 --> 28:33.130
Boy!

28:33.338 --> 28:36.592
Sweet cola cans.
Where's my little nipper got to?

28:36.800 --> 28:37.551
Hey, wake up!

28:38.760 --> 28:41.346
How can you sleep
when my boy's missing?

28:41.555 --> 28:43.056
- What's he missing, boss?
-What?!

28:43.265 --> 28:45.726
No, he's missing!
I can't find him.

28:45.934 --> 28:47.644
He must have
snuck out last night.

28:47.853 --> 28:50.772
Let's move out!
And I mean everybody, out!

28:50.981 --> 28:52.482
I want my boy back!

28:55.819 --> 28:56.987
Son!

29:01.366 --> 29:03.285
Wait, Maya.

29:03.493 --> 29:05.037
I'm hungry again.

29:05.245 --> 29:08.081
Come on, Willi.
We've got to find Flip.

29:08.290 --> 29:09.541
I'm tired.

29:09.750 --> 29:13.337
- You're always tired.
-I'm a growing bee.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.506
I need my sleep.

29:17.966 --> 29:19.968
There's something
under that leaf.

29:20.177 --> 29:24.681
- Maybe it knows where Flip is.
-Maya! What are you doing?

29:24.890 --> 29:28.560
He doesn't look too dangerous.
He's stripy and little like us.

29:28.769 --> 29:31.980
- But kind of shiny, too.
-I'm not little.

29:32.189 --> 29:34.733
- Hello.
-Hey, get your own leaf.

29:36.235 --> 29:38.987
We're looking for a big green
crazy bug called Flip.

29:39.196 --> 29:41.615
- Have you seen him?
-Huh, baby stuff.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.408
I'm looking for...

29:43.617 --> 29:45.619
No, I can't tell you.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.287
Unless

29:47.496 --> 29:50.040
you join my secret
Bug Hunters' Club.

29:50.249 --> 29:51.875
No, Maya.
There's an old hive saying:

29:52.042 --> 29:53.335
"No clubs with strange bugs."

29:53.543 --> 29:55.629
who're you calling
strange, fuzz face?

29:55.837 --> 29:58.298
- We're in!
-I like you.

29:58.507 --> 30:00.133
You've got guts.

30:00.342 --> 30:04.429
Okay. Hold onto your stripes.
Cause I'm hunting the greediest,

30:04.638 --> 30:07.182
most disgustingest
bugs in the meadow.

30:07.391 --> 30:10.394
Honey guzzling soul-suckers.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.562
Oh, yeah!
I want to meet these nice bugs.

30:12.771 --> 30:14.231
No, you don't!
No, she doesn't!

30:14.439 --> 30:17.317
Let's go, Bug Hunters!
Danger calls.

30:20.779 --> 30:22.823
What kind of bug are you,
anyway?

30:23.031 --> 30:24.866
The best kind. Sting.

30:25.075 --> 30:27.661
"Stink-Bug."
Yeah, good one.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.580
- Really, though, what are you?
-What do you think? I'm a...

30:30.789 --> 30:32.582
- Hornets!
-Hornets?

30:32.791 --> 30:35.544
- Son!
-Oh, no. Dad.

30:35.752 --> 30:37.879
- Hornets!
-Really?

30:38.088 --> 30:41.425
Hide, Maya! They'll munch you!
Tell her, Stink-Bug.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.260
Stink-Bug?

30:43.468 --> 30:45.470
I thought he was our new friend.

30:45.679 --> 30:48.473
The hornets got him, Maya.
And we're next!

30:48.682 --> 30:51.310
There's an old bee saying:

30:51.518 --> 30:53.520
"Stay in the hive, stay alive."

30:55.605 --> 30:57.983
These are dark times, bees.

30:58.191 --> 31:00.569
The hive is in grave danger.

31:00.777 --> 31:04.614
Today hornets broke in
and stole our royal jelly.

31:04.823 --> 31:09.077
We must get it back.
The Queen's life depends on it.

31:09.286 --> 31:10.787
But we have no proof.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.250
Crawley, I think the
Queen needs to lie down.

31:15.459 --> 31:18.295
- This way, Your Majesty.
-We mustn't jump to conclusions.

31:18.503 --> 31:20.964
It's time we showed
those grubby hornets

31:21.173 --> 31:23.675
who runs this meadow.

31:24.885 --> 31:25.927
Wait!

31:26.136 --> 31:29.181
Maya and Willi
have disappeared.

31:29.389 --> 31:31.391
They must have gone outside.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.352
I'm no nursemaid.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.437
Babies are your department.

31:35.645 --> 31:39.483
Now if you don't mind
I've got a hive to save.

31:39.691 --> 31:42.277
No. Wait. Wait!

31:42.486 --> 31:44.363
We have to do something.

31:44.571 --> 31:45.864
Please.

31:48.617 --> 31:50.118
Well, tickle my pincers!

31:50.327 --> 31:52.162
I never thought I'd see the day

31:52.371 --> 31:54.498
when a bee would
ask an ant for help.

31:54.706 --> 31:56.625
Oh please, Colonel.

31:56.833 --> 31:58.418
Don't worry, ma'am.
We'll find them.

31:58.627 --> 32:00.712
Men! We're looking
for two baby bees.

32:00.921 --> 32:04.674
Fuzzy, stripey, boogly eyes
and bobbly heads. Get it?

32:04.883 --> 32:06.760
Boogly eyes and
bobbly heads, Sir!

32:06.968 --> 32:09.137
Good.
Bart, Bert, that way!

32:09.346 --> 32:10.764
Tex, Lex, that way!

32:10.972 --> 32:12.557
Troy, Trey, over there!

32:13.433 --> 32:14.559
Arnie...

32:14.768 --> 32:16.353
...and Barney.

32:16.561 --> 32:17.979
- Yes, Sir!
-Reporting for duty, Sir!

32:18.188 --> 32:20.982
- Turn around! No, not you, the--
-Yes, Sir!

32:21.191 --> 32:23.860
- Turn around, you on the left!
-Yes, Sir!

32:24.069 --> 32:25.737
I meant my left!

32:25.946 --> 32:28.073
Your left when you're facing us,
Sir, or when you're facing away?

32:28.281 --> 32:29.616
- Sir?
-Oh, forget it.

32:29.825 --> 32:31.743
Sir!
Forgetting it now, Sir.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.377
Just go...

32:40.585 --> 32:42.129
somewhere over that way.

32:42.337 --> 32:44.840
And don't break anything!
I order you

32:45.048 --> 32:46.925
-not to break anything.
-Yes, Sir!

32:47.134 --> 32:48.802
You can count on us, Sir,
not to break anything.

32:49.010 --> 32:50.345
Sir, Sir yes Sir!
Breaking everything, Sir!

32:50.554 --> 32:51.972
No, we've got to
not break anything.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.598
Not breaking everything, Sir!

32:53.807 --> 32:56.017
- My foot!
-I'll thump you...

32:57.018 --> 32:59.104
- Attention!
-Yes, Sir!

33:00.522 --> 33:03.608
- Just go.
-Yes, Sir!

33:03.817 --> 33:05.485
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut...

33:08.864 --> 33:12.284
Sir, request permission
to ask a question, Sir.

33:12.492 --> 33:13.910
Go ahead, soldier.

33:14.119 --> 33:16.329
What was the
mission again, Sir?

33:18.373 --> 33:21.418
Find those little bees!

33:23.545 --> 33:25.714
<i>Round and round and round!</i>

33:25.922 --> 33:28.091
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.801
And I don't
frighten easily.

33:30.010 --> 33:31.511
Oh, don't be a fluff belly.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.013
They sound tiny.

33:33.221 --> 33:33.763
Hello!

33:35.432 --> 33:39.603
Don't be scared, little ones.
We just need some directions.

33:39.811 --> 33:41.897
Okay. No one there.
Let's go.

33:42.105 --> 33:43.231
Oh, Willi. Come on!

33:44.274 --> 33:45.567
Visitors!

33:46.401 --> 33:49.029
Say hello, my children.

33:49.237 --> 33:50.739
Hello!

33:50.947 --> 33:53.617
Just in time for breakfast.

33:53.825 --> 33:55.744
And I'm hungry.

33:57.162 --> 34:00.999
What about you guys?
We've got some rotten fruit.

34:01.208 --> 34:03.376
So, what brings you
little pollinators

34:03.585 --> 34:04.920
to the House of Moth?

34:05.128 --> 34:07.797
We're, um, looking for
a bug called Flip.

34:08.005 --> 34:09.257
The grasshopper?

34:09.466 --> 34:10.592
Cool!

34:10.800 --> 34:12.886
He'll be cutting loose
at the big party.

34:13.094 --> 34:15.388
A party?
How do we get there?

34:15.597 --> 34:17.681
Easy.
Wait for the sun to set,

34:17.891 --> 34:20.726
then fly straight
till you find a bright light,

34:20.936 --> 34:24.648
and just go round and
round and round...

34:26.483 --> 34:29.027
I think we need
different directions, Willi.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.277
I agree.

34:32.947 --> 34:34.699
Maybe he knows
where the party is.

34:34.908 --> 34:37.118
No, Maya.
That's a dung beetle.

34:37.327 --> 34:38.786
They say one
whiff of that ball

34:38.995 --> 34:40.664
can knock a bee
right out of the sky.

34:40.871 --> 34:42.748
How bad can it be?

34:45.335 --> 34:48.380
Excuse me, Mr. Dung-Roller.

34:48.588 --> 34:52.592
What?
But... nobody ever talks to me.

34:52.801 --> 34:54.469
We're looking for the big party.

34:54.678 --> 34:57.430
I never get invited to parties.

34:57.639 --> 35:00.183
Apparently I've got odor issues.

35:00.392 --> 35:03.645
- You could come with us.
-Oh, thanks, Littlun'.

35:03.853 --> 35:07.274
But not all insects take as
kindly as you to old Kurt.

35:07.482 --> 35:08.483
You go on, though.

35:08.692 --> 35:11.111
Parties usually happen
at Jitterbug Hollow.

35:11.319 --> 35:13.029
I'll show you the way.
First you've got to...

35:13.238 --> 35:14.489
Here, hold this.

35:14.698 --> 35:17.576
So, to get to Jitterbug Hollow,
you follow this trench

35:17.784 --> 35:19.494
then you turn
left at the daisies.

35:19.703 --> 35:20.996
And when you
get to the river,

35:21.204 --> 35:23.623
you've got to follow it all the
way around Gorgo's hedge,

35:23.832 --> 35:26.251
My ball!
Whatever you do,

35:26.459 --> 35:29.504
don't go through Spider Forest!

35:29.713 --> 35:33.133
Go through
Spider Forest, got it.

35:33.341 --> 35:33.967
Maya, you stink.

35:35.093 --> 35:36.928
- You want a hug, Willi?
-No no no.

35:37.137 --> 35:39.389
- No. No!
-Give me a hug!

35:39.598 --> 35:42.267
- Help! Help!
-Come back here, Willi!

35:42.475 --> 35:46.563
- Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut...
-That's it!

35:46.771 --> 35:49.149
Any more huts and
we'd be a village.

35:49.357 --> 35:50.650
Where are we?

35:50.859 --> 35:53.987
Shh! I'm picking up bee vibes.
And something else, too.

35:55.614 --> 35:58.116
Kind of strong-smelling...

35:58.325 --> 35:59.993
Pollen? Is it pollen?

36:00.201 --> 36:01.828
Where there's bees,
there's always pollen.

36:02.037 --> 36:03.455
That's got to be pollen.

36:03.663 --> 36:06.458
Pollen!
Come to Papa!

36:11.379 --> 36:13.673
This doesn't smell like pollen.

36:15.258 --> 36:17.218
And it certainly doesn't
taste like pollen.

36:25.185 --> 36:29.522
"Oh, it's easy, just go
through the Spider Forest."

36:29.731 --> 36:33.151
What kind of sick, twisted
dung beetle was he?

36:33.360 --> 36:36.571
See? I told you, Maya.
The dung got to his head.

36:39.157 --> 36:41.910
- Hi, Bug Hunters.
-Sting Bug!

36:42.118 --> 36:44.704
We're closing in on those
ugly soul-suckers.

36:44.913 --> 36:45.997
Oh,goody.

36:46.206 --> 36:48.124
"Goody?"
There are spiders

36:48.333 --> 36:50.210
and monsters
in this forest, Maya.

36:50.418 --> 36:52.671
Aw! You're not going
to cry, are you?

36:52.879 --> 36:54.756
Anyone would think you
were a bee baby!

36:54.964 --> 36:56.216
Well, er...

36:56.424 --> 36:57.634
Thank you?

36:58.301 --> 36:59.636
Think, Willi.

36:59.844 --> 37:01.096
What is he?

37:04.933 --> 37:09.938
Spiky antennas,
spiky feet, spiky tail.

37:10.146 --> 37:11.272
Just like...

37:11.481 --> 37:12.065
a...

37:12.774 --> 37:14.651
-hornet!
-Where?

37:14.859 --> 37:17.737
Him! There was a picture
just like him in the hive.

37:17.946 --> 37:20.240
But where are
his big red eyes?

37:20.448 --> 37:22.867
And isn't he a bit small?

37:23.076 --> 37:24.369
I'm not small.

37:24.577 --> 37:25.787
Wait a minute.

37:25.995 --> 37:28.248
Hive?
You're bees?

37:28.456 --> 37:31.292
Get back!
Don't suck my soul!

37:33.712 --> 37:36.131
Look!
He's changing colour!

37:37.507 --> 37:41.177
Run, Maya! He's turning
into a spider monster!

37:41.386 --> 37:42.804
A spider what?

37:44.848 --> 37:47.350
Hello, little ones.

37:47.559 --> 37:49.853
- You look lost!
-No, no, no, no!

37:50.061 --> 37:53.231
Care to join me for dinner?

37:53.440 --> 37:55.483
I'm not hungry.

37:56.568 --> 38:00.029
Help! I'm serious!
Help me! Guys?

38:00.238 --> 38:02.240
- We have to save him.
-No, Maya,

38:02.449 --> 38:05.118
- We'll be spider food.
-Not if she can't catch us.

38:05.326 --> 38:09.497
- Hey, what are you doing?
-Four wings are faster than two.

38:09.706 --> 38:11.166
I really need some
help here, guys!

38:11.374 --> 38:13.460
You flap your wings, I'll steer.

38:13.668 --> 38:16.337
- Why do you get to steer?
-Don't leave me!

38:16.546 --> 38:17.630
We're coming!

38:22.510 --> 38:23.887
Grab him!

38:24.804 --> 38:27.390
Don't worry, we'll save you!

38:38.818 --> 38:39.778
Bees!

38:41.154 --> 38:44.532
You follow and you follow
and you don't give up.

38:44.741 --> 38:48.870
And that, my friend, is the key
to being a great tracker.

38:49.078 --> 38:50.830
You know, Barney,
you are so full of--

38:51.039 --> 38:53.792
Shh! I'm definitely
picking up bee vi...

38:53.958 --> 38:57.128
Vibes.
It's pronounced vi...

38:57.337 --> 38:59.047
Vi... Hey!

38:59.839 --> 39:01.883
Hey.

39:02.091 --> 39:03.635
Respect, Brother Sun.

39:03.843 --> 39:07.472
We gratefully
accept your bounty.

39:07.680 --> 39:11.476
- Say hello, my children.
-Hello!

39:13.853 --> 39:15.522
Now, where were we?

39:17.482 --> 39:20.151
Oh, yeah!
Bright lights...

39:20.360 --> 39:24.364
- We were going round and round.
-And round, and round...

39:33.289 --> 39:34.624
That was close.

39:34.833 --> 39:37.085
Next time you
save someone's life,

39:37.293 --> 39:39.671
try not to kill them.

39:41.297 --> 39:43.716
Saved by a
pair of bee-babies...

39:43.925 --> 39:46.386
- What's Dad gonna say?
-"Thank you?"

39:46.594 --> 39:48.137
You don't know my Dad.

39:48.346 --> 39:50.390
And we don't want to.
Leave him, Maya.

39:50.598 --> 39:51.724
No, Willi, wait.

39:51.933 --> 39:53.768
We can't just leave
him here like this.

39:53.977 --> 39:55.103
Maya, we need to find

39:55.311 --> 39:56.813
Jitterbug Hollow
before it gets dark.

39:57.021 --> 40:00.650
Wait, Jitterbug Hollow?
It's near my camp.

40:00.859 --> 40:02.819
- I can take you.
-We don't need your help.

40:03.027 --> 40:04.863
We know exactly
where we're going.

40:05.071 --> 40:06.072
Somewhere that way!

40:06.281 --> 40:10.702
- You mean into Gorgo's land?
-Gorgo?

40:10.910 --> 40:13.621
If you get me out of here
I'll show you the way.

40:13.830 --> 40:15.582
No, Maya.
It's a trap.

40:15.790 --> 40:19.043
But Willi, he knows the way.
And there's a party, remember.

40:19.252 --> 40:21.087
- I bet there's pollen...
-PoHen?

40:21.296 --> 40:22.130
...and buttercups...

40:22.338 --> 40:24.007
- Let's go!
-...and nectar!

40:24.215 --> 40:27.343
Come on, let's go!
What are we waiting for?

40:27.552 --> 40:30.138
What about your dad?
Won't he be worried?

40:30.346 --> 40:31.431
My Dad worried?

40:32.557 --> 40:35.268
He's, like, the
toughest guy ever.

40:36.728 --> 40:39.564
My boy... where is he?

40:39.772 --> 40:41.190
Ah, boss?

40:41.399 --> 40:43.610
- Something in my eye.
-Look!

40:46.529 --> 40:48.573
Turn around, daisy-sniffers!

40:48.781 --> 40:50.491
You're on hornet turf!

40:50.700 --> 40:52.619
Bee turf!
You paper-chewers

40:52.827 --> 40:55.413
have until first light to
leave our meadow.

40:55.622 --> 40:59.042
Oh, really?
Hornets budge for no bug.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.210
What do you
think of that, huh?

41:02.921 --> 41:04.756
You'll see.

41:04.964 --> 41:07.675
Get out of here before
I de-fuzz the lot of you!

41:07.884 --> 41:09.052
You've been warned.

41:09.260 --> 41:11.262
There will be consequences.

41:12.597 --> 41:15.266
Who's afraid of those
striped puff-balls?

41:15.475 --> 41:16.935
Keep looking! Son!

41:17.143 --> 41:18.227
Son!

41:18.728 --> 41:20.146
Son!

41:34.410 --> 41:35.703
I've got it.

41:37.372 --> 41:38.665
Ha-ha!

41:39.415 --> 41:41.459
- Mine!
-No, mine!

41:41.668 --> 41:42.627
Mine...

41:42.835 --> 41:44.504
Gimme, gimme!
I saw it first!

41:51.761 --> 41:53.304
Hornets...

41:54.013 --> 41:55.682
Okay, okay, okay.

41:55.890 --> 41:58.643
Remember our training.
Touch nothing.

41:58.851 --> 42:01.771
Leave everything
exactly as we found--

42:13.533 --> 42:14.283
Oooh...

42:15.118 --> 42:17.036
Maybe they won't notice.

42:36.973 --> 42:39.392
Jitterbug Hollow!

42:39.600 --> 42:41.185
Dragonfly rides!

42:41.394 --> 42:42.937
Dragonfly rides!

42:43.146 --> 42:45.982
Get your dragonfly rides here!

42:49.193 --> 42:50.069
Awesome.

42:51.154 --> 42:53.531
- Want a ride, kid?
-Maybe later.

42:53.740 --> 42:55.241
Anytime.

42:56.659 --> 42:58.619
Well? So where
is this Flip?

42:58.828 --> 42:59.912
It's starting.

43:08.421 --> 43:11.507
- Ladybugs and garden pests!
-Look!

43:13.176 --> 43:16.804
Welcome to Jitterbug Hollow!

43:17.013 --> 43:18.556
Hit it, Mozz!

43:20.558 --> 43:22.727
Let's get some melody!

43:25.229 --> 43:27.648
Now... bugbox!

43:30.651 --> 43:33.905
Let's hear it for the misfits!

43:34.113 --> 43:37.366
What an audience
we've got tonight.

43:37.575 --> 43:39.869
Worms, gnats,
crickets, horseflies.

43:40.078 --> 43:41.162
Why the long faces?

43:41.370 --> 43:43.247
- Any bugs here from out of town?
-Me, Flip!

43:43.456 --> 43:45.833
- Hey, Flip, it's me!
-Welcome, little one.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.377
- Did they give you a name yet?
-Maya.

43:48.586 --> 43:51.047
Maya? I like it.

43:51.255 --> 43:54.175
What brings you
to Jitterbug Hollow, Maya?

43:54.383 --> 43:58.304
Well, you said if I ever had a
question I should come to you.

43:58.513 --> 44:01.724
Ask away.
We're all friends here.

44:03.392 --> 44:05.186
Where do I belong, Flip?

44:06.104 --> 44:08.147
Oh, an easy one.

44:08.356 --> 44:11.859
Last I checked, bees
belonged in hives, Maya.

44:12.068 --> 44:15.530
They don't like me back there.
I'm just too different.

44:15.738 --> 44:18.783
Please, Flip, you need to
teach me how to live out here.

44:18.991 --> 44:20.243
In the meadow.

44:20.451 --> 44:22.203
Here. Hold this.

44:22.411 --> 44:26.332
Maya, the answers
you seek are in here.

44:26.541 --> 44:28.626
Step inside the magic flower

44:28.835 --> 44:30.378
and be transformed

44:30.586 --> 44:34.340
into the bug that
everyone loves!

44:34.549 --> 44:37.176
Behold the mysteries
of the meadow

44:37.385 --> 44:39.971
as I transform Maya.

44:40.179 --> 44:42.348
You say ci-cay-da,
I say ci-cah-da...

44:43.808 --> 44:47.103
Well, little buzzer,
how do you feel?

44:47.311 --> 44:50.022
Huh? Hey!
I'm still the same.

44:50.231 --> 44:51.524
Exactly.

44:51.732 --> 44:53.401
You don't need my help.

44:53.609 --> 44:55.528
- Huh?
-Just be yourself

44:55.736 --> 44:58.114
and you'll make it anywhere.

44:58.322 --> 45:01.617
Let's make this little buzzer
feel welcome.

45:04.787 --> 45:06.581
<i>The grass is always greener</i>

45:06.789 --> 45:09.041
<i>in some other insect's yard.</i>

45:09.250 --> 45:11.502
<i>Just look across
the big fence now</i>

45:11.711 --> 45:13.379
<i>You'll see it's not so hard!</i>

45:13.588 --> 45:14.797
<i>It's not so hard!</i>

45:15.006 --> 45:17.091
<i>It's easy to let those big bees</i>

45:17.300 --> 45:19.468
<i>make you feel
a little bit small.</i>

45:19.677 --> 45:21.721
<i>Just keep you head
held high now.</i>

45:21.929 --> 45:24.974
<i>Now don't you feel...
taller than tall?</i>

45:29.729 --> 45:33.649
<i>- It don't matter what they say!
-It don't matter!</i>

45:33.858 --> 45:38.529
<i>Find that rhythm in your heart!
Just bee yourself every day!</i>

45:38.738 --> 45:40.948
<i>Shake your bee-hind all about!</i>

45:41.157 --> 45:43.159
<i>Shake-shake... Shake it out...</i>

45:43.367 --> 45:47.747
<i>Shout it out!
And bee yourself every day!</i>

45:50.666 --> 45:52.960
<i>Ask your new friends
around you!</i>

45:53.169 --> 45:55.296
<i>they flew from near and far!</i>

45:55.504 --> 45:57.590
<i>We come from the
same bug family!</i>

45:57.798 --> 45:59.967
<i>And we love you
the way you are!</i>

46:00.176 --> 46:02.470
<i>Life's all about the
bugs who love you!</i>

46:02.678 --> 46:04.889
<i>Good friends can
be hard to find...</i>

46:05.097 --> 46:07.308
<i>Red beetle, blue beetle!
Big smelly dung beetle!</i>

46:07.516 --> 46:10.102
<i>It don't matter what
their kind!</i>

46:10.311 --> 46:12.063
<i>It don't matter what
they say!</i>

46:13.773 --> 46:18.778
<i>Find that rhythm in your heart!
Just bee yourself every day!</i>

46:18.986 --> 46:22.949
- Shake your bee-hind all about.
-Shake, shake! Shake it out!

46:23.157 --> 46:28.704
<i>Say it loud, shout it out,
and bee yourself every day!</i>

46:28.913 --> 46:32.458
Remember, Maya:
What goes in must come out.

46:32.667 --> 46:33.960
"Laaaa!"

46:34.919 --> 46:37.129
"Laaaa!"

46:37.338 --> 46:39.090
<i>I wanna sing songs.</i>

46:39.298 --> 46:41.467
<i>I want to be free.</i>

46:41.676 --> 46:43.803
<i>I wanna be me.</i>

46:44.011 --> 46:47.723
<i>- I'm Maya the Bee-eel
-Maya!</i>

46:53.271 --> 46:55.731
<i>I</i> am Maya the Bee!

46:56.983 --> 46:58.567
You're a star, Maya.

46:58.776 --> 47:02.530
C'mon. I'll show you
how to move your bee-hind.

47:02.738 --> 47:04.198
You. Me. Dancefloor.

47:08.995 --> 47:11.038
<i>Sing out loud!
Shout it out!</i>

47:11.247 --> 47:13.082
<i>- And bee yourself!
- Son!</i>

47:21.632 --> 47:22.591
Yeah!

47:25.094 --> 47:27.555
Away from that bee! Now!

47:28.472 --> 47:30.516
What has she done to you?

47:30.725 --> 47:32.435
My Buzzywump is the
bee-hatingest

47:32.643 --> 47:33.978
hornet in the meadow.

47:34.186 --> 47:37.732
Undo your evil hive magic.
I'm warning you.

47:40.359 --> 47:43.904
Your name is "Buzzywump"?

47:44.113 --> 47:45.364
It's a good name.

47:46.115 --> 47:48.242
Dad, I can explain.

47:48.451 --> 47:50.119
She and him...

47:50.328 --> 47:53.247
They kinda sorta...
saved my life.

47:53.456 --> 47:55.791
But it's not like we're
friends or anything.

47:59.670 --> 48:02.506
I'm sensing a lot of tension
here. You're all bugged out.

48:02.715 --> 48:05.217
Done to pieces.
Are you eating properly?

48:05.426 --> 48:09.555
Come on, Hank,
she saved your boy.

48:09.764 --> 48:12.850
This happy hopper just saved
you a stinging, bee-nut!

48:13.059 --> 48:16.020
But keep away from my son.

48:16.228 --> 48:18.064
Oh, boy,
you are so grounded.

48:18.272 --> 48:20.441
Any more grounded
and you'd be a worm.

48:24.153 --> 48:25.488
It's okay.

48:25.696 --> 48:28.532
He's just a mixed-up
little bug like you were.

48:28.741 --> 48:30.201
He'll learn.

48:30.409 --> 48:32.036
I hope so.

48:36.874 --> 48:39.043
- Royal Adviser?
-Yes?

48:40.252 --> 48:42.380
I mean, come in!
Did you...

48:42.588 --> 48:46.258
-give the hornets my message?
-They won't leave the meadow...

48:46.467 --> 48:48.427
- Ma'am.
-ExceHenL

48:49.887 --> 48:51.680
Dismissed, sergeant.

48:55.976 --> 48:57.103
Crawley?

48:57.311 --> 49:00.689
Yes, Your Sneakiness?
I mean Your Schemingness.

49:00.898 --> 49:02.525
It's time.

49:02.733 --> 49:06.112
You brought this on
yourself, old buzzer.

49:06.320 --> 49:08.739
I wish there were another way.
We need...

49:08.948 --> 49:11.325
a strong leader.
And you are just...

49:11.534 --> 49:13.786
too weak.

49:13.994 --> 49:17.957
Crawley? Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

49:18.165 --> 49:20.668
It depends on what you're
thinking, Your Thinkyness.

49:27.174 --> 49:29.176
Your Majesty!

49:47.319 --> 49:50.614
Nice legwork, Mr. Centipede.
See you next time.

49:50.823 --> 49:53.492
Alright, you flies.
No more eating vomit.

49:53.701 --> 49:55.828
Oh, there you are.
Come on.

49:56.036 --> 49:58.372
Flip is ready to take us home.

49:58.581 --> 49:59.748
I am home, Willi.

50:01.041 --> 50:05.671
- Here? In the meadow?
-This is where I belong.

50:05.880 --> 50:09.258
With stink bugs and
smelly, stinky hornets?

50:09.467 --> 50:11.927
No. With all bugs.

50:12.136 --> 50:14.472
With all bugs
except me, huh?

50:14.680 --> 50:17.183
Don't be cross.
I'll visit you.

50:17.391 --> 50:19.894
Why would you visit
boring old Willi

50:20.102 --> 50:23.189
in his boring old hive
when you've got all this?

50:23.397 --> 50:26.484
I put my stinger
on the line for you.

50:26.692 --> 50:30.446
- And this is how you thank me?
-But, Willi...

50:30.654 --> 50:33.616
With all your new bug friends
I guess you won't need

50:33.824 --> 50:35.743
poor old Willi anymore.

50:35.951 --> 50:37.286
Don't be silly.

50:37.495 --> 50:38.913
Stay with me.

50:39.121 --> 50:40.831
There's an old bee saying:

50:41.040 --> 50:43.250
"You can always
count on a friend."

50:43.459 --> 50:45.753
But I guess I got that
one wrong, too.

50:45.961 --> 50:48.589
Willi!
Willi!

51:04.730 --> 51:08.108
Son, I know you think
you like that bee,

51:08.317 --> 51:09.777
but she's
twisted your thoughts.

51:09.985 --> 51:11.362
Dad, not all bees are--

51:11.570 --> 51:14.573
Shh. It's quiet.
Too quiet.

51:23.666 --> 51:25.918
By my pointy pincers!

51:27.127 --> 51:30.047
Pollen...
This is bee work.

51:30.256 --> 51:33.926
Those sneaky wax-nibblers
set us up.

51:34.134 --> 51:36.220
Didn't I say you
can't trust bees?

51:36.428 --> 51:37.263
But Dad...

51:37.471 --> 51:38.973
Assemble the Five Tribes!

51:39.181 --> 51:41.684
If those fur-balls
want to play rough,

51:41.892 --> 51:44.353
they picked on the
wrong hornets!

51:46.063 --> 51:47.398
Oh, no.

51:51.235 --> 51:55.155
Whoa. If this is Jitterbug
Hollow, I'm a flea.

51:55.364 --> 51:56.907
We're lost, Antstein.

51:57.116 --> 51:58.284
You're lost, bug-brain.

51:58.492 --> 52:00.995
My feelers know exactly
where we are.

52:05.207 --> 52:06.792
Oh, yeah? Where?

52:07.001 --> 52:08.836
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

52:09.044 --> 52:12.214
I'm getting something.
Bee vibes.

52:12.423 --> 52:15.092
- Excuse us, fellas.
-Everybody, shh!

52:15.301 --> 52:18.304
Yep, yep. Definitely a bee
around here somewhere.

52:18.512 --> 52:20.097
Is it Willi?

52:20.306 --> 52:22.349
- We're looking for a bee, too.
-That's great, kid,

52:22.558 --> 52:23.726
A little shush, please.

52:23.934 --> 52:25.227
Genius at work!

52:25.436 --> 52:27.521
Arnie, hey, Arnie, look.

52:27.730 --> 52:30.899
Fuzzy, stripy,
boogly eyes and bobbly head!

52:31.108 --> 52:33.152
- A tigerfly!
-No, a bee.

52:33.360 --> 52:34.778
- Oh, a bee!
-A bee!

52:34.987 --> 52:38.073
And Flip! Hey, Arnie, didn't I
say we were on the right track?

52:38.282 --> 52:39.825
- Where've you been, naughty bee?

52:40.034 --> 52:41.744
Miss Cassandra's got enough
worries without you

52:41.952 --> 52:43.037
buzzing off into the meadow.

52:43.245 --> 52:44.622
Hey, don't you know
the Queen's sick?

52:44.830 --> 52:47.249
The hornets stole
her royal jelly.

52:55.466 --> 52:58.677
It was the Adviser.
I saw her with the royal jelly.

52:58.886 --> 53:01.096
Flip, we need to
get back to the hive.

53:01.305 --> 53:03.849
- Willi!
-Good work, boys.

53:04.058 --> 53:05.100
Hee-hop!

53:06.810 --> 53:10.522
- Willi!
-Willi! Where are you?

53:10.731 --> 53:12.733
Willi!

53:15.611 --> 53:17.863
"I am home, Willi.

53:18.072 --> 53:20.532
"Here at Jitterbug Hollow
I'm so happy."

53:20.741 --> 53:25.204
Fine, be like that. I'll go home
too, and I'll feel happy.

53:25.412 --> 53:29.458
Back to your pond, froggy.
I'm not in the mood.

53:29.667 --> 53:33.879
- We've got pollen!
-Oh, pollen.

53:34.088 --> 53:37.466
No.
No, Willi. Stay strong.

53:37.675 --> 53:40.010
But you'll be
stronger with pollen.

53:41.512 --> 53:42.763
NQI NQ ' ' “C! "Q ' no: "Q

53:42.971 --> 53:44.682
Walk on, Willi. Walk on.

53:44.890 --> 53:46.350
Okay, you win.

53:46.558 --> 53:48.268
Gimme gimme gimme
gimme pollen!

53:52.815 --> 53:55.192
Willi?
Willi, come back.

53:55.401 --> 53:57.653
He's caught in an updraft!

53:57.861 --> 53:59.863
Those are big flutter bugs.

54:00.072 --> 54:01.490
They're not flutter bugs,

54:01.699 --> 54:03.242
they're bats!

54:05.786 --> 54:10.457
We have to do something!
When I count to three, kick!

54:10.666 --> 54:11.875
One, two, three.

54:12.084 --> 54:13.001
Hee-hop!

54:18.924 --> 54:20.801
Nice birdy.

54:21.009 --> 54:23.011
Hold on, Willi,
I'm coming!

54:30.644 --> 54:33.439
I'm coming, kids! Hee-hop!

54:35.941 --> 54:37.943
Hey, ugly!
Over here!

54:43.574 --> 54:45.951
Maya!
Hold on, kids!

55:17.983 --> 55:19.943
You kids okay?

55:22.279 --> 55:23.655
Willi!

55:25.491 --> 55:26.909
Willi?

55:27.993 --> 55:29.244
No, no.

55:29.453 --> 55:30.996
Please wake up.

55:35.209 --> 55:37.503
You said you had pollen.

55:37.711 --> 55:38.962
Oh, Willi.

55:40.130 --> 55:43.425
I am so sorry.
Are you still my friend?

55:43.634 --> 55:46.887
Of course. You must never
let a friend go, Maya.

55:47.095 --> 55:50.849
Especially your
best and only friend.

55:53.143 --> 55:55.979
- Where are we?
-Shh. Gorgo's hedge.

55:56.188 --> 55:58.190
Gorgo's hedge?

55:58.398 --> 56:01.360
- Which way is the hive, Flip?
-We're going back to the hive?

56:01.568 --> 56:03.946
Straight through Gorgo's land.
No, no, no!

56:04.154 --> 56:06.240
Maya, go all
the way around.

56:06.448 --> 56:08.033
- Yeah, listen to him!
-There's no time!

56:08.242 --> 56:09.493
This is the quickest way.

56:09.701 --> 56:11.453
I'm confused.
What's going on?

56:11.662 --> 56:13.956
The Queen needs us, Willi.
I'll tell you on the way.

56:14.164 --> 56:17.167
She's got more spark then a
barrel full of lightning bugs.

56:17.376 --> 56:18.293
Hee-hop!

56:20.295 --> 56:22.798
We're gonna get eaten,
I know it.

56:30.264 --> 56:31.640
Royal bees!

56:31.849 --> 56:33.767
I regret to inform you

56:33.976 --> 56:35.561
that after a long
battle with illness

56:35.769 --> 56:37.437
our beloved Queen

56:37.646 --> 56:40.190
is not quite one
hundred percent.

56:40.399 --> 56:43.360
That is to say, well,
she has buzzed off

56:43.569 --> 56:45.779
to the big hive in the sky.

56:46.655 --> 56:49.116
She has passed away.

56:51.034 --> 56:53.996
But every hive
needs a strong leader.

56:54.204 --> 56:56.039
And that is why I,

56:56.248 --> 56:58.125
your new hive master,

56:58.333 --> 57:01.461
am honored
to announce our new Queen.

57:01.670 --> 57:03.380
Buzzlina,

57:03.589 --> 57:06.633
the Conqueror!

57:11.346 --> 57:14.975
- Is it true?
-My dear bees,

57:15.183 --> 57:19.980
let us pause to remember
our beloved leader.

57:20.188 --> 57:25.235
We all know who is responsible
for this grave injustice:

57:25.444 --> 57:27.779
The filthy hornets.

57:27.988 --> 57:32.951
First our poor gentle Queen,
and next our hive.

57:33.160 --> 57:36.038
Are we going to let them
get away with it?

57:36.246 --> 57:38.415
- No!
-At first light,

57:38.624 --> 57:43.629
we'll run those horrid
buzz-boxes out of our meadow.

57:43.837 --> 57:46.173
This is for the Queen!

57:46.381 --> 57:47.549
Oh, no.

57:47.758 --> 57:50.302
Maya and Willi are out there.

57:55.807 --> 57:57.851
That's Gorgo's belly.

57:58.060 --> 58:00.228
He's hungry, Maya.
We should turn back.

58:00.437 --> 58:02.481
Come on, Willi.

58:02.689 --> 58:04.066
Wait for us, Maya.

58:04.274 --> 58:05.859
Don't go too far ahead.

58:12.157 --> 58:14.785
- Gorgo's got Maya!
-Maya? Come on!

58:19.081 --> 58:20.499
Gorgo wants to eat us!

58:20.707 --> 58:22.417
- Get off, greedy guts.
-Hey!

58:22.626 --> 58:25.796
- Over here!
-Maya...

58:26.004 --> 58:28.298
Gorgo is going to
be really, really cross.

58:28.507 --> 58:30.676
You should never, ever
land on a monster.

58:30.884 --> 58:32.552
It's just common sense.

58:32.761 --> 58:34.596
Gorgo's not a monster, Willi.

58:34.805 --> 58:36.139
She's right.

58:36.348 --> 58:39.351
This is what everybody's
so scared of?

58:39.559 --> 58:41.770
He's made out of grass.

58:41.979 --> 58:45.399
A grass monster?
They're the worst.

58:48.026 --> 58:50.153
Hold on!

58:51.989 --> 58:53.156
Willi!

58:55.283 --> 58:56.243
Maya!

58:57.619 --> 58:58.745
Maya!

59:06.795 --> 59:07.796
Maya!

59:09.297 --> 59:10.924
A baby Gorgo!

59:11.133 --> 59:14.219
Enough is enough.
Payback time.

59:19.391 --> 59:20.559
Willi...

59:20.767 --> 59:22.811
- What are you doing?
-Maya?

59:23.020 --> 59:25.188
Kids!
Are you okay?

59:25.397 --> 59:28.942
- Kind of.
-I tip my hat to you, Maya.

59:29.151 --> 59:31.945
You taught this old bug
something new.

59:32.154 --> 59:36.450
Come on, before
poor old Gorgo falls on us!

59:42.622 --> 59:44.541
I am a dirty bee monster.

59:44.750 --> 59:47.502
- I've come to suck your soul.
-Stop that.

59:47.711 --> 59:48.962
Bees don't suck souls.

59:49.171 --> 59:51.339
Some of them are
even kind of nice.

59:51.548 --> 59:53.300
Sting's a bee-lover.

59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.433
The Five Tribes!

01:00:02.434 --> 01:00:03.977
Welcome, my brothers!

01:00:04.186 --> 01:00:06.104
Eat, dance and be feral.

01:00:06.313 --> 01:00:08.607
Because at first light tomorrow

01:00:08.815 --> 01:00:13.737
we'll gonna squash those pollen
guzzlers once and for all!

01:00:16.364 --> 01:00:18.617
Oh, no. Maya!

01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:34.508
Halt! Bees only!

01:00:34.716 --> 01:00:36.426
But we have to
speak to the Queen.

01:00:36.635 --> 01:00:38.428
How do we know
you're not a hornet spy?

01:00:38.637 --> 01:00:42.265
How do we know you're not a
frog in fluffy pyjamas?

01:00:42.474 --> 01:00:44.476
- Tough crowd.
-Sorry,

01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:46.520
- Queen's orders.
-Flip!

01:00:46.728 --> 01:00:49.481
You go, Maya.
I'll be right out here.

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:54.611
All gather in the great hall.

01:00:58.156 --> 01:00:59.324
Ahh!

01:00:59.533 --> 01:01:02.119
- Oh! Hey!
-Out of the way!

01:01:02.327 --> 01:01:04.871
I don't think I like
this hive anymore.

01:01:09.126 --> 01:01:11.211
How do we get past
the queen's guards?

01:01:11.419 --> 01:01:14.214
Don't worry, Maya.
I got this.

01:01:14.422 --> 01:01:17.843
Hey, you guys,
check this out.

01:01:18.051 --> 01:01:19.052
Willi...

01:01:30.856 --> 01:01:32.315
Nice moves.

01:01:32.524 --> 01:01:34.151
Heh,bye.

01:01:38.071 --> 01:01:40.282
Your Majesty,
You're better.

01:01:42.784 --> 01:01:43.910
See?

01:01:44.119 --> 01:01:44.953
But...

01:01:45.162 --> 01:01:46.538
But it's not possible.

01:01:46.746 --> 01:01:48.665
Why's the golden hat
on your head?

01:01:48.874 --> 01:01:49.749
Where is the Queen?

01:01:50.876 --> 01:01:52.669
You're looking at her.
Guards!

01:01:52.878 --> 01:01:55.463
- What have you done?
-Coming, Your Highness!

01:01:55.672 --> 01:01:57.048
Hot honey cakes.

01:01:58.008 --> 01:01:59.259
Just the way
you like them.

01:02:00.719 --> 01:02:02.929
Maya, you're alive! That's...

01:02:04.139 --> 01:02:05.932
very, very
serious indeed.

01:02:06.141 --> 01:02:08.977
Don't you know?
Our dear Queen...

01:02:09.186 --> 01:02:11.021
-has passed away.
-No!

01:02:11.229 --> 01:02:14.024
Don't you worry, 396.

01:02:14.232 --> 01:02:17.319
We'll have our revenge
on those ghastly hornets.

01:02:17.527 --> 01:02:21.448
Liar! You stole the royal jelly
from the queen and hid it.

01:02:24.701 --> 01:02:27.621
It's true, I'm guilty.

01:02:29.372 --> 01:02:31.875
Guilty of caring too much:

01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:33.752
Against my better judgment

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.881
I let this mixed-up little bee
go into the meadow alone.

01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:41.301
Poor child, she's not
in her right mind.

01:02:41.509 --> 01:02:44.137
Wait! She's lying.
You have to believe me.

01:02:44.346 --> 01:02:47.015
I know where she
hid the royal jelly.

01:02:47.224 --> 01:02:50.143
Well, if you're so sure,
why don't you show us

01:02:50.352 --> 01:02:51.645
where it is?

01:02:53.855 --> 01:02:56.441
This is it, in here.

01:02:57.525 --> 01:03:00.278
Poor little bee's
got meadow fever.

01:03:00.487 --> 01:03:03.365
Now everyone can see
what a liar you are.

01:03:07.202 --> 01:03:08.703
Huh? But where is it?

01:03:08.912 --> 01:03:11.581
- Lock her up.
-No, let go.

01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:15.418
- She's lying.
-it's for your own good, 396.

01:03:15.627 --> 01:03:20.465
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got some hornets to crush.

01:03:20.674 --> 01:03:23.093
- I promise, she took it!
-This way.

01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:25.345
No, let go.
She's lying.

01:03:25.553 --> 01:03:26.304
No!

01:03:27.764 --> 01:03:31.559
No, the hornets didn't do it!
Please believe me.

01:03:31.768 --> 01:03:33.937
I told you she was a liar.

01:03:35.814 --> 01:03:37.232
Give me that!

01:03:55.292 --> 01:03:57.168
Your Majesty!

01:03:59.504 --> 01:04:01.047
Coming.

01:04:06.011 --> 01:04:07.512
- Willi.
-Maya.

01:04:07.721 --> 01:04:08.638
Willi, Willi!

01:04:09.973 --> 01:04:12.851
I'll have you out of there
in two wingbeats.

01:04:14.978 --> 01:04:16.521
Make that
three wingbeats.

01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:19.691
- You're not supposed to be here!
-Willi!

01:04:19.899 --> 01:04:23.445
What are you doing here?
Stop!

01:04:23.653 --> 01:04:24.904
Stop!

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:29.200
Stop!
Come back!

01:04:32.287 --> 01:04:33.955
Grab him!

01:04:35.957 --> 01:04:36.958
Traitor!

01:04:37.167 --> 01:04:39.669
- Stop that tubby dunce.
-Stop!

01:04:44.382 --> 01:04:46.551
Left, right, left, right...

01:04:58.146 --> 01:05:01.900
This is a waste of time.
We have bugs to crush.

01:05:13.036 --> 01:05:14.704
Fall in, soldier.

01:05:21.753 --> 01:05:23.671
- Willi...
-Keep moving!

01:05:25.673 --> 01:05:27.384
Keep formation!

01:05:28.218 --> 01:05:31.388
Willi!
Don't go away.

01:05:34.599 --> 01:05:36.768
Don't leave me.

01:06:06.297 --> 01:06:08.216
Flip! Flip!

01:06:16.808 --> 01:06:19.519
- Get off me, bug!
-Flip, help!

01:06:19.727 --> 01:06:21.521
Wait, is that Willi!

01:06:21.729 --> 01:06:23.314
Stink Bug?

01:06:24.566 --> 01:06:26.025
You have to warn your Queen.

01:06:26.234 --> 01:06:28.027
Dad's making an
ambush on the hive.

01:06:28.236 --> 01:06:31.322
But the bees are making
an ambush on you hornets.

01:06:31.531 --> 01:06:33.199
Flip!

01:06:41.332 --> 01:06:42.292
Hello?

01:06:43.585 --> 01:06:44.669
Who's there?

01:06:45.587 --> 01:06:48.089
Miss Queen?
Miss Queen.

01:06:48.298 --> 01:06:49.924
You're alive.
Your Majesty.

01:06:50.133 --> 01:06:52.177
- It's me, Maya.
-Maya?

01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:56.264
It's okay, I'm going
to get us out of here.

01:07:01.978 --> 01:07:06.274
No, no, no, stay with me.
Please.

01:07:06.483 --> 01:07:08.151
I'm sorry, Miss Queen.

01:07:08.359 --> 01:07:09.986
It's my fault.

01:07:10.195 --> 01:07:14.782
I just wanted to see
the outside world.

01:07:14.991 --> 01:07:18.036
If I had stayed in the hive
like a good bee,

01:07:18.244 --> 01:07:21.331
I could have
stopped the Adviser.

01:07:22.999 --> 01:07:26.002
It's not your fault, Maya.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.547
You followed your heart.

01:07:29.756 --> 01:07:31.466
That takes courage.

01:07:32.634 --> 01:07:34.010
You stay...

01:07:34.219 --> 01:07:36.346
just the way you are,

01:07:37.514 --> 01:07:39.474
'Maya...
"No!

01:07:39.682 --> 01:07:42.060
No. Wake up.

01:07:44.479 --> 01:07:47.899
- Maya.
-Willi! You came back.

01:07:49.275 --> 01:07:50.693
And Sting.

01:07:51.778 --> 01:07:53.613
I'm sorry about what I said.

01:07:53.821 --> 01:07:54.781
I didn't mean it.

01:07:54.989 --> 01:07:57.033
You're the best
friend a hornet

01:07:57.242 --> 01:07:59.077
-could have.
-Maya...

01:07:59.285 --> 01:08:01.621
Thank sweet nectar you're safe!

01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:03.331
How did you know I was here?

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.166
A charming grasshopper,

01:08:05.375 --> 01:08:06.960
a fiery hornet

01:08:07.168 --> 01:08:11.673
and a brave little bee snuck in
and told me everything.

01:08:11.881 --> 01:08:13.216
Your Majesty...

01:08:13.424 --> 01:08:14.676
Stay with us.

01:08:15.552 --> 01:08:17.053
She's fading fast.

01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:20.223
- She needs the royal jelly.
-The Royal Adviser took it.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.517
How are we going to
get it back from her?

01:08:22.725 --> 01:08:23.935
It's not gonna be easy.

01:08:24.143 --> 01:08:26.604
All the hornet tribes are going
up against the bees.

01:08:26.813 --> 01:08:28.273
Take me to them.

01:08:28.481 --> 01:08:32.026
Only I can stop this.

01:08:32.234 --> 01:08:34.237
- We could carry her.
-Too slow.

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:36.738
We'll never catch
the bees in time.

01:08:36.948 --> 01:08:37.865
I'll do it.

01:08:38.073 --> 01:08:40.158
I'll go ahead and
get the royal jelly.

01:08:40.368 --> 01:08:42.912
- You follow me with the Queen.
-No, Maya.

01:08:43.121 --> 01:08:46.207
It's too dangerous.
You're just one little bee.

01:08:46.416 --> 01:08:49.377
- Two little bees.
-And a hornet.

01:08:49.586 --> 01:08:52.087
And a whole meadow
full of friends.

01:08:52.296 --> 01:08:55.258
If anyone can do it, she can.

01:08:55.466 --> 01:08:57.510
You really keep
surprising me.

01:08:57.719 --> 01:09:00.138
I'm so proud of you, Maya.

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:01.305
Be careful.

01:09:02.515 --> 01:09:05.935
Let's go, Bug Hunters!
Danger calls!

01:09:40.345 --> 01:09:41.888
We're flying ants!

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.645
There they are!
There's still time. Come on.

01:09:57.403 --> 01:09:59.614
Oh, no.
It's Dad.

01:10:10.833 --> 01:10:12.126
How cute.

01:10:12.335 --> 01:10:15.338
Little pollen pinchers
all in a row.

01:10:17.799 --> 01:10:19.926
Prepare to attack, bees.

01:10:21.761 --> 01:10:25.723
It'll take a miracle
to stop them now.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.854
- Or a Gorgo.
-Gorgo?

01:10:32.063 --> 01:10:35.400
Come on. You need to trust me.

01:10:35.608 --> 01:10:38.069
Come on, guys!
What are you waiting for?

01:10:42.532 --> 01:10:43.866
My dear bees,

01:10:44.075 --> 01:10:47.161
remember our
dear departed Queen.

01:10:47.370 --> 01:10:49.414
This is for her.

01:10:49.622 --> 01:10:52.834
Today we make bee-story.

01:10:53.042 --> 01:10:54.836
Enough fancy talk.

01:10:55.044 --> 01:10:57.171
Spitball those syrup-suckers!

01:11:02.135 --> 01:11:05.054
- Crawley... attack!
-Attack. Right.

01:11:05.263 --> 01:11:07.682
First row, prepare buckets!

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:11.060
- I said attack, wax-brain!
-Oh, okay.

01:11:11.269 --> 01:11:13.813
- Attack!
-But, Buzzlina...

01:11:14.021 --> 01:11:17.692
- Do it now, you fool!
-Release the honey!

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.277
I said now!

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:26.826
Not on us, honey-heads!
The hornets!

01:11:27.034 --> 01:11:28.703
Drop it on the hornets!

01:11:30.413 --> 01:11:32.081
Charge!

01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:41.924
Missed me!

01:11:46.679 --> 01:11:50.183
- Get off, you fuzzy-buzzer!
-You get off,

01:11:50.391 --> 01:11:52.977
you overgrown gnat!
Crawley!

01:11:54.854 --> 01:11:57.565
Missed me! Too slow!
Who wants a piece of Crawley?

01:12:09.577 --> 01:12:11.037
Gorgo.

01:12:11.245 --> 01:12:16.209
Who wakes Gorgo
from his sleep?

01:12:19.754 --> 01:12:24.592
All this fighting
makes Gorgo hungry.

01:12:28.638 --> 01:12:31.474
- Right! Go right!
-Left!

01:12:31.682 --> 01:12:34.352
No, I said the other left!

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.524
Naughty bugs, the meadow
belongs to everyone!

01:12:39.732 --> 01:12:44.654
Gorgo say: Bees
and hornets be friends.

01:12:44.862 --> 01:12:46.113
And Gorgo say:

01:12:46.322 --> 01:12:48.658
Give little bees pollen
whenever they're hungry.

01:12:48.866 --> 01:12:51.702
- Willi!
-And let little hornets explore

01:12:51.911 --> 01:12:53.287
wherever they want.

01:12:53.496 --> 01:12:55.915
And how about some respect for
dung beetles while you're at it?

01:13:00.127 --> 01:13:07.343
If bees and hornets want
to fight, they can fight Gorgo.

01:13:07.552 --> 01:13:09.136
- Oh.
-Huh?

01:13:10.555 --> 01:13:13.057
- Hi.
-She's with the hornets.

01:13:13.266 --> 01:13:15.643
Buzzywump?
He's been bee-napped.

01:13:15.852 --> 01:13:19.105
No, he hasn't!
Hornets and bees can be friends.

01:13:19.313 --> 01:13:20.231
Look.

01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:23.067
Ff lends?

01:13:23.276 --> 01:13:25.903
Not friends, Dad.
Best friends.

01:13:26.112 --> 01:13:29.532
- But what about our camp?
-It wasn't us.

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:32.618
Whoa, whoa, listen, listen.
We didn't do nothing.

01:13:32.827 --> 01:13:35.913
Those flimsy hornet-huts,
they just fell over.

01:13:38.583 --> 01:13:40.376
Enough with the
stupid ants.

01:13:40.585 --> 01:13:42.879
Get those filthy jelly thieves.

01:13:45.298 --> 01:13:46.674
Yes!

01:13:47.967 --> 01:13:50.344
- Charge!
-Wait!

01:13:50.553 --> 01:13:54.724
They didn't steal the jelly.
It was the Royal Adviser.

01:13:54.932 --> 01:13:57.226
She's hiding it under her crown.

01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:00.396
Oh, please!

01:14:01.272 --> 01:14:03.399
Can you really trust a bee

01:14:03.608 --> 01:14:05.818
who sneaks around in disguises

01:14:06.027 --> 01:14:10.990
playing foolish
children's... games?

01:14:24.045 --> 01:14:26.714
No! Dad!
No, please!

01:14:26.923 --> 01:14:28.132
Dad.No!

01:14:28.758 --> 01:14:31.552
Dad! Dad! Dad!

01:14:31.761 --> 01:14:34.388
We can't save them
unless we work together!

01:14:34.597 --> 01:14:37.683
Everybody,
grab a piece of Gorgo!

01:14:49.779 --> 01:14:51.030
Lift!

01:14:57.536 --> 01:14:59.163
It's working!

01:15:07.463 --> 01:15:09.340
- Dad.
-Son.

01:15:10.424 --> 01:15:13.302
- Dad.
-My little Buzzywump.

01:15:14.762 --> 01:15:17.598
You're not going cry,
are you, Dad?

01:15:17.807 --> 01:15:18.641
Me? Pah, no.

01:15:18.849 --> 01:15:21.227
I just got something in my eye.

01:15:21.435 --> 01:15:22.728
That's my Dad.

01:15:22.937 --> 01:15:25.147
Crawley, my crown.

01:15:27.525 --> 01:15:30.194
Look!
The royal jelly!

01:15:33.489 --> 01:15:36.200
Thief!
Arrest him!

01:15:37.159 --> 01:15:39.161
What are you waiting for?

01:15:41.038 --> 01:15:44.000
Crawley, arrest
this hive traitor

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:45.918
or I'll have your stripes.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:49.547
- Crawley?
-EflOugh!

01:15:49.755 --> 01:15:54.427
No more lies, Buzzlina.
You've caused enough hurt.

01:15:54.635 --> 01:15:56.429
Are you disobeying me?

01:15:56.637 --> 01:16:00.433
I am your Queen,
bow before me.

01:16:00.641 --> 01:16:03.894
All of you
bow before your Queen.

01:16:06.939 --> 01:16:09.275
That's more like it. You...

01:16:09.483 --> 01:16:11.819
396, bow.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.534
- That's better.
-Hee-hop.

01:16:21.954 --> 01:16:23.622
It can't be!

01:16:25.207 --> 01:16:28.085
Willi, the royal jelly.
Quick!

01:16:34.508 --> 01:16:36.510
Drink, Your Majesty.

01:16:38.929 --> 01:16:42.933
- Thank you, little one.
-Maya, we did it.

01:16:57.782 --> 01:17:00.076
Buzzlina...

01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:07.792
I know how this looks,
but I did it for the hive.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.044
For all of us.

01:17:10.252 --> 01:17:13.756
I just wanted us all
to be happy.

01:17:18.094 --> 01:17:20.429
Your Majesty.

01:17:23.432 --> 01:17:26.769
Fellow insects,
Maya is right.

01:17:26.977 --> 01:17:30.815
We have no quarrel
with the hornets, or indeed

01:17:31.023 --> 01:17:33.067
any other insects.

01:17:34.527 --> 01:17:36.237
Ff lends?

01:17:38.948 --> 01:17:41.242
Come on, Dad!

01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:43.994
Ah, what the hedge?

01:17:44.203 --> 01:17:45.871
Friends it is.

01:17:48.833 --> 01:17:53.254
I now invite all insects
to the hive

01:17:53.462 --> 01:17:55.840
for a royal celebration.

01:18:01.637 --> 01:18:03.180
Oh yes, Maya.

01:18:03.389 --> 01:18:07.768
Of course that
includes dung beetles.

01:18:07.977 --> 01:18:09.436
I'm going to a party?

01:18:09.645 --> 01:18:11.313
I'm going to a party!

01:18:11.522 --> 01:18:13.149
I gotta bring a gift.

01:18:13.357 --> 01:18:16.318
I'm gonna bring
the best ball ever!

01:18:30.207 --> 01:18:36.297
Willi and Sting, for bravery
and services to bee-kind,

01:18:36.505 --> 01:18:40.676
I declare you both
Hive Heroes.

01:18:40.885 --> 01:18:42.386
That's my boy.

01:18:46.515 --> 01:18:48.058
Maya.

01:18:55.691 --> 01:18:57.610
My dear bees,

01:18:57.818 --> 01:19:01.822
Maya has taught us that we
have a great deal to learn.

01:19:02.031 --> 01:19:07.786
The meadow belongs to all bugs.
Not just to bees or hornets.

01:19:07.995 --> 01:19:10.789
Every bug
has a role to play.

01:19:10.956 --> 01:19:12.208
Oh, and me, Miss Queen?

01:19:12.416 --> 01:19:14.793
What about me?
Do I have a role?

01:19:15.002 --> 01:19:18.422
Of course, Maya.
A very important role.

01:19:18.631 --> 01:19:22.885
I hereby declare you
Hive Ambassador.

01:19:23.093 --> 01:19:25.638
You will discover things
about the meadow

01:19:25.846 --> 01:19:27.723
and report back to us.

01:19:27.932 --> 01:19:30.893
And I really am a
normal little bee?

01:19:31.101 --> 01:19:32.645
Oh, no.

01:19:33.771 --> 01:19:37.483
You are a very
special little bee.

01:19:37.691 --> 01:19:38.943
Yes!

01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:42.780
I fit in.
Did you hear the Queen?

01:19:42.988 --> 01:19:45.616
There's a place
for me in the hive.

01:19:45.824 --> 01:19:48.327
- Hit it, Flip.
-Let's boogie!

01:19:54.416 --> 01:19:56.502
You. Me. Dancefloor.

01:19:58.087 --> 01:20:00.714
Nobody puts Queenie
in the corner.

01:20:01.924 --> 01:20:04.218
Buzzlina, buzz buzz.

01:20:09.848 --> 01:20:12.559
Buzz, buzz, 127.
Back to work!

01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:16.605
Special ball delivery.

01:20:16.814 --> 01:20:18.023
Coming through.

01:20:19.358 --> 01:20:21.986
I love this party!

01:20:22.194 --> 01:20:23.988
- PoHen?
-PoHen!PoHen!

01:20:25.197 --> 01:20:28.534
And around, and around,
and around...

01:20:33.414 --> 01:20:34.665
Pollen!

01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:38.419
Your Majesty...

01:20:38.627 --> 01:20:39.712
Your Majesty.

01:20:40.838 --> 01:20:43.549
Reports of new bugs
in the meadow.

01:20:47.177 --> 01:20:50.806
Well, we should send
someone out to greet them.

01:20:51.015 --> 01:20:52.266
Shouldn't we?

01:20:54.351 --> 01:20:55.978
Maya?

01:21:08.699 --> 01:21:10.284
<i>Woo-hoe'.!</i>

01:21:16.623 --> 01:21:19.626
Maya!
Not so fast.

01:21:19.835 --> 01:21:23.047
I forgot to tell you the most
important bee-saying of all:

01:21:23.255 --> 01:21:26.342
"You should always
wait for Willi."

01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:30.429
<i>There's a place
very nearby,</i>

01:21:30.637 --> 01:21:34.475
<i>Amongst the flowers
and the morning dew;</i>

01:21:34.683 --> 01:21:41.398
<i>it's a secret paradise
Everybody's waiting just for you</i>

01:21:41.607 --> 01:21:45.861
<i>Oh, here comes Maya the bee</i>

01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:50.199
<i>With the greatest
friends that you'll ever see</i>

01:21:50.407 --> 01:21:52.910
<i>Yes, here comes Maya the bee</i>

01:21:53.118 --> 01:21:56.914
<i>With a brand new story
just for you and me</i>

01:21:57.081 --> 01:22:00.292
<i>Yes, here comes Maya the bee</i>

01:22:00.501 --> 01:22:05.214
<i>With a brand new story
just for you and me</i>

01:25:38.594 --> 01:25:42.639
<i>Every little party bee
is coming down tonight</i>

01:25:42.848 --> 01:25:46.143
<i>My friend Willi's joining me,
it's such a joyful sight</i>

01:25:46.351 --> 01:25:47.936
<i>There's music playing
all night long</i>

01:25:48.145 --> 01:25:50.272
<i>And Flip conducts
the band</i>

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.274
<i>And everyone bursts
into song</i>

01:25:52.482 --> 01:25:54.026
<i>We scream and clap
our hands</i>

01:25:54.234 --> 01:25:56.028
'Cause here comes Maya

01:25:56.236 --> 01:25:58.614
<i>Sing and take a chance
'cause she'll be doing</i>

01:25:58.822 --> 01:26:01.450
<i>She'll be doing
the Maya dance</i>

01:26:01.658 --> 01:26:05.495
<i>And we are turning
shoo-be-doo-bee-do</i>

01:26:05.704 --> 01:26:09.333
<i>And we are waving
shoo-be-doo-bee-day</i>

01:26:09.541 --> 01:26:13.086
<i>And we are jumping
shoo-be-doo-bee-do</i>

01:26:13.295 --> 01:26:17.591
<i>And we are singing 'till
the morning comes around</i>

01:26:19.593 --> 01:26:21.470
<i>We are having
such a ball</i>

01:26:21.678 --> 01:26:23.597
<i>We're dancing all
in line</i>

01:26:23.805 --> 01:26:27.267
<i>Every creature great and
small is waiting for the sign</i>

01:26:27.476 --> 01:26:31.313
<i>Pay attention, here it comes
the star is in the house</i>

01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:33.148
<i>Hit the lights and
roll the drums</i>

01:26:33.357 --> 01:26:35.192
<i>We're quiet as a mouse</i>

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.235
'Cause here comes Maya

01:26:37.444 --> 01:26:39.863
<i>Sing and take a chance
'cause she'll be doing</i>

01:26:40.072 --> 01:26:42.783
<i>She'll be doing
the Maya dance</i>

01:26:42.991 --> 01:26:46.578
<i>And we are turning
shoo-be-doo-bee-do</i>
