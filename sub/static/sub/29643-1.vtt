-[muffled chattering]
-[feet stomping]

00:08.776 --> 00:11.210
[man] Somebody watch him? Jesus!

00:11.212 --> 00:13.712
[muffled chattering]

00:15.616 --> 00:17.149
[man] The fuck
are you looking at?

00:17.151 --> 00:18.717
[man] I got the fives,
you get the rest.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.652
[man] Yeah, I got [mumbles].

00:20.654 --> 00:21.787
I got him, I got him!

00:21.789 --> 00:25.057
[car door rattles]

00:26.427 --> 00:27.593
[man] The fuck is
goin' on over there?

[men shouting]

00:46.047 --> 00:48.213
[Bruce] Come on. Wake up!

00:48.215 --> 00:49.448
Arthur!

00:50.451 --> 00:52.451
Arthur, we need you here, man!

00:52.453 --> 00:53.619
Fuck, wake up, brother!

00:54.822 --> 00:57.156
Arthur! Arthur,
we need you here now!

00:57.158 --> 00:58.424
-Is he breathing?
-I dunno.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.691
-What am I supposed to do?

00:59.693 --> 01:01.460
Shit, there's
fucking blood everywhere.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.195
We got to do something, or he's
gonna get goddamn blood--

01:03.197 --> 01:04.696
-Lay him down!
-Fuckin' shit!

01:04.698 --> 01:07.533
Help me, move!
We got to get him out of here.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.468
Put his head down.
Kick his legs up.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.403
Well,
you got to help me, help me!

01:11.405 --> 01:13.372
-Lean down, hand him down.
-Oh shit, man.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.441
-[Arthur] Just lift
his legs up a little bit.
-I'm tryin'!

01:15.443 --> 01:17.543
-Lift his legs, man. Come on!
-Blood everywhere,
I can't find it.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.711
[Jimmy] He's not gonna make it.
He's out cold now.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.714
-[Arthur] There was
a clinic back by the hotel.
-Oh, no, we're not going.

01:22.716 --> 01:26.085
-It's not worth it,
we'll get caught.
-He needs our help right now.

01:26.087 --> 01:27.619
-He won't make it.
-Think about this.

01:27.621 --> 01:30.355
-We can not let him die.
-Give us away and exposes us.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.691
No, you guys, they had a
cushion. The exchange can wait.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.227
-Arthur, it's not open.
-It's open,
it's a straight shot.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.129
-It's fucking behind us!
-It's not that far.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.431
-We're not going
to make the window.
-We're fucking ourselves.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.666
We understand,
we'll take the highway.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.868
[men shouting]

01:42.870 --> 01:45.704
-That bullet could've
ripped into any of you!
-But it didn't!

01:46.574 --> 01:49.174
-But what if it did, huh?
-Yeah, I didn't fuck up
and waste my bullet!

01:49.176 --> 01:52.211
-Our part of the team--
-He is part of the team.
That is all that matters!

01:52.213 --> 01:55.114
-Over me man,
we're not going anywhere.
-He's with Cortez.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.850
[dramatic music]

01:57.852 --> 02:00.886
[police siren wailing]

02:26.814 --> 02:29.314
I would not let
any of you bleed out.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.316
-We're not letting him.
-He'd let us die.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.684
[Jimmy] Gil's right,
we barely know him.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.253
[Wes] He'll get help
once we're free.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.921
No, he risked his life
just like you guys.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.457
-I agree, but there's the job.
-If we're late we're all fucked.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.693
-We need to keep moving.
-We're not showing up to Cortez
with his guy dead.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.896
[Jimmy] Well with
what you said about Cortez,
not arriving is much worse.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.664
Oh, so you're gonna stand by
and watch him fucking die?

02:45.666 --> 02:47.499
[Jimmy] We're not
standing by if we lose him.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.801
-It's his own damn fault.
-He didn't stay in the hallway.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.737
If it was on me I'd feel
a little bit more compelled

02:51.739 --> 02:53.172
-to keep him on, shit.
-[man choking]

02:53.174 --> 02:54.540
Fuck, brother, what the hell?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.408
Come on, stay with us, man.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.577
[Gil] Stay with us,
brother, come on.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.213
Come on, breathe, breathe!

03:01.215 --> 03:02.514
Come on, come on.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.626
[somber music]

03:16.864 --> 03:19.665
[thump]

03:52.800 --> 03:55.300
-Well, that simplifies things.
-Jimmy.

03:55.970 --> 03:58.503
-Have some respect.
-What do you want me to do, huh?

03:58.505 --> 04:00.772
-Nothing, I want you
to shut the fuck up.
-Well sit around--

04:00.774 --> 04:01.740
-Shit!
-Fuck--

04:01.742 --> 04:02.908
Come on, Arthur it's over!

04:02.910 --> 04:04.343
It's over!

04:04.345 --> 04:06.878
There was nothing
we could've done anyway.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.248
-We couldn't save him.
-We should just put all this
behind us

04:09.250 --> 04:09.948
and get out of here!

04:09.950 --> 04:11.316
We need to fucking move.

04:11.318 --> 04:12.484
I'm fucking aware!

04:16.824 --> 04:17.756
Let's fucking go.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.896
Well, let's fucking move.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.966
[ominous music]

04:33.540 --> 04:36.642
Tell me one of you besides
Rafael can drive this thing?

04:38.312 --> 04:40.979
[dramatic music]

06:31.425 --> 06:33.592
[keypad beeping]

[door buzzing]

06:39.066 --> 06:39.998
[door rattles]

08:50.864 --> 08:53.532
-Then pull out the ramps.
-[Wes] I'm not
getting back in that car.

08:53.534 --> 08:54.666
[Bruce] Arthur,
you have all the keys,

08:54.668 --> 08:55.634
what are we doing?

09:00.541 --> 09:02.173
No one can drive a truck.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.742
I can't even drive stick.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.211
Well, we should at
least try something.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.579
We can't just
keep sitting out here.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.314
Who feels confident driving?

09:09.316 --> 09:10.248
Fuck no.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.584
I don't.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.219
Well I've got the RV.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.187
[Gil] No,
you live in a trailer park.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.290
Okay then you fucking do it.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.224
Uh-uh.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.965
[ominous music]

09:26.967 --> 09:28.633
You're up Bruce.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.289
-[Bruce] Shall we
make this thing move?
-I dunno, man,

09:51.291 --> 09:53.124
haven't driven stick in years.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.794
[Bruce] Fuck all
the decals are worn off.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.162
Doesn't show the gears.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.863
You got this.

09:58.865 --> 10:03.635
-Let's see.
-[keys jangling]

10:03.637 --> 10:06.638

-[truck rattling]
-Fuck, man.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.857
Come on.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.725
Give it some gas, let's go.

11:00.727 --> 11:03.194
[truck rattling]

11:04.665 --> 11:06.698
-I put it in the wrong gear.
-Well, get in the right gear.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.901
Fucking clutch,
it's burned to shit.

11:12.706 --> 11:15.273
-Is this burned out,
or something?
-What the fuck?

11:15.275 --> 11:18.109
[dramatic music]

11:18.912 --> 11:20.979
Fuck this.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.814
Hey Bruce, we should stop.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.916
You're taking up the whole road.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.451
Bruce, watch out!

11:26.453 --> 11:31.890
-[horn blaring]
-[brakes screech]

11:34.795 --> 11:37.128
Well, we can't just sit here,
at least pull us off the road.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.297
-[distant voice] Gil!
-Okay, okay--

11:39.299 --> 11:40.465
[Arthur] What the fuck?

11:40.467 --> 11:41.700
-Get back here.
-What's going on?

11:41.702 --> 11:43.902
[Wes] Leave the fucking money!

11:43.904 --> 11:45.737
Gil, where the fuck you goin'?

11:45.739 --> 11:48.406
-Get back here!
-Get the fuck back here!

11:48.408 --> 11:51.376
-Bring the fucking
money back, Gil!
-Get the fuck back here.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.778
What the fuck you going
to do with fake bills, huh?

11:54.715 --> 11:56.214
Get back inside.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.149
I can't risk you
getting picked up.

12:01.054 --> 12:01.986
I'll fucking shoot.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.355
Then fucking shoot.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.457
I'm not fucking around.

12:05.459 --> 12:06.891
Drop the money.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.061
Gil!

12:10.363 --> 12:12.397
[dramatic music]

12:12.399 --> 12:13.331
Gil!

12:14.735 --> 12:17.802
[police siren wailing]

12:20.273 --> 12:23.074
[truck rumbling]

12:23.076 --> 12:26.044
[dramatic music]

12:30.917 --> 12:33.885
-[sirens blaring]
-[Gil mumbling]

12:39.893 --> 12:41.426
The fuck you thinking?

12:45.432 --> 12:46.364
Get up!

12:47.000 --> 12:47.932
Let's go.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.173
[Bruce] There's no need to
leave the truck. It's been
sitting here all week.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.543
-It's scenery at this point.
-[Jimmy] Then what should
we do? We can't just sit here.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.145
What the fuck, give it back.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.212
-Fuck you.
-Fuck you, give it back!

13:01.214 --> 13:02.714
Don't fucking test me.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.215
Look, I'm not gonna be
the only one here without a gun.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.917
Now fucking give it back.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.054
-Everyone hand in
your guns, now!
-[Wes] What? No way!

13:10.056 --> 13:12.023
-[Jimmy] I'm not giving him
my gun. That's fucked up.
-Turn them in.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.491
I'm not having
another gun pointed at me.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.160
[Wes] I didn't
fucking do anything.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.328
Everyone, turn 'em in.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.831
[guns clattering]

13:19.833 --> 13:22.534
They won't be that far away.
They'll be in
the trunk, let's go.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.904
[Jimmy] Now what?
How are we supposed to
make it to the bus stop?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.338
[Wes] Why do cops keep
traveling this road anyway?

13:27.340 --> 13:28.873
They were obviously doing
something out this way.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.842
We can't be out
in the open like this.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.110
This is the problem.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.547
Everyone in the trailer.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.525
So now what are we gonna do?
What's the fucking plan?

13:47.527 --> 13:50.562
-I say we go
straight to the harbor.
-[Bruce] And fuck Cortez?

13:50.564 --> 13:52.330
No that's not an option,
we're not quitting.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.032
We're gonna miss
the window at this rate.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.267
No, it's his truck,
it's his money.

13:56.269 --> 13:59.204
We've got time.
We're gonna do the exchange.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.939
We're gonna take the clean
bills and we're gonna--

14:00.941 --> 14:02.140
Either way, we need
to start moving now.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.859
Cortez is back on that bus...

14:03.860 --> 14:05.577
-Call him and tell him
to fucking wait.
-We need a payphone.

14:05.579 --> 14:07.378
-No, you can't
reach him by phone.
-[Bruce] We can't wait.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.880
Well if he leaves
he's not getting his plates.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.048
Finding him isn't gonna do shit

14:10.050 --> 14:11.282
unless we start moving now!

14:11.284 --> 14:12.884
No, waiting
makes him vulnerable.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.419
He's not gonna do it.
The time between buses

14:14.421 --> 14:16.254
-is all we get.
-[Wes] Then what do you propose?

14:17.257 --> 14:19.591
-We need a new car.
-They know how we escaped,

14:19.593 --> 14:21.960
now you want to
jump back into something
that matches our description?

14:21.962 --> 14:24.596
-We're not gonna fucking walk!
-I think Bruce
should keep driving.

14:24.598 --> 14:26.564
You try driving!
Fuck this rig.
-[Jimmy] We're not gonna make it

14:26.566 --> 14:28.466
-at five miles an hour.
-There's a junkyard
not too far back.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.001
[Bruce] That's not gonna work.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.070
[Jimmy] He's right,
what if nothing starts?

14:37.110 --> 14:39.277
There's a bar,
a mile or two inland.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.511
Basically it sits by itself.

14:40.513 --> 14:41.913
[Wes] That works.

14:41.915 --> 14:42.647
So who's going?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.184
Gil, you like to run.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.219
I'm not leaving
without my paycheck.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.255
-Just fucking go.
-Someone else is going.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.527
We'll, I'm covered in blood.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.196
Fuck, I'll do.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.130
I'll run.

15:00.033 --> 15:00.965
All right, fine.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.066
That's a plan.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.034
I'll draw you a map.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.235
There's a pen up front.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.273
If it's not this one
it's the next one.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.574
-You'll see it.
-Got it.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.541
Does this make sense?

15:10.543 --> 15:12.010
[Jimmy] I'm ready, fuck.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.312
Well, try to blend in,
don't stand out.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.314
We're the only
white people here.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.284
Steal something
nondescript, something simple.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.451
You sure you know where this is?

15:20.453 --> 15:21.586
I got it.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.688
Can I get my gun back now?

15:23.690 --> 15:25.390
Just do as I say.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.624
Don't set off any alarms.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.393
I know what I'm doing.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.527
All right.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.195
Now, get going.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.263
[door rattles]

15:33.600 --> 15:35.433
[Jimmy] I got to lock you in.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.469
-What?
-I need to lock the trailer.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.272
-What the fuck? No, you don't.
-How do I know you guys
won't try driving again

15:41.274 --> 15:43.541
-and leave without me?
-Because that's
not how we operate.

15:43.543 --> 15:48.379
-Now stop wasting time.
-I'm fucking serious.
-[Wes] Start fucking running!

15:48.381 --> 15:50.248
We're not gonna leave you
behind, you have my word.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.383
You guys can hijack
an oncoming car, I don't know.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.153
No, I'm not takin a hostage,
I'm gonna be
waiting here for you.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.587
Yeah, stop wasting time, go!

15:56.589 --> 15:58.556
We're not gonna do that, man.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.959
-How do we know
you won't run away?
-Why the fuck would I run away?

16:00.961 --> 16:02.694
-My money's here.
-You have nothing
to worry about.

16:02.696 --> 16:03.628
Then prove it.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.731
[Gil] This is
fucking ridiculous.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.399
You just fucking ran off.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.405
The gate gets locked
or I don't go.

16:16.710 --> 16:19.711
[insects buzzing]

16:22.015 --> 16:27.251
[radio playing music]

18:15.528 --> 18:17.095
[Wes] I'm boiling in here.

18:21.134 --> 18:21.833
Just relax.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.202
It's been a half an hour!

18:26.339 --> 18:27.738
It only seems that long

18:27.740 --> 18:30.141
because we've been
sitting here in silence.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.779
[tense music]

18:41.187 --> 18:42.887
Whatcha gonna do
with your share, Wes?

18:42.889 --> 18:46.124
How much longer do
we have to fucking wait? Huh?

18:46.126 --> 18:47.758
I don't like being locked up.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.563
That's your fault.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.533
You put it in his head
we'd flee.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.237
[dramatic music]

18:59.239 --> 19:00.738
You never
should've agreed to this.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.739
[Wes] This is all fucked up.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.511
I don't leave people behind.
I have no problem waiting.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.347
-Things happen. He could get
run over, you don't know!
-Yeah, I agree.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.315
How do we know he's not going
to just fucking die out there?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.651
It hasn't been that long!

19:13.653 --> 19:15.486
Just sit down and relax!

19:16.789 --> 19:19.357
[dramatic music]

20:18.952 --> 20:19.951
Okay.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.466
No problems, huh?

20:45.979 --> 20:47.345
Thanks.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.514
Thank you.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.652
[radio playing music]

21:05.798 --> 21:09.400
[light percussive music]

21:36.796 --> 21:39.530

[gunshot]

22:49.802 --> 22:51.769
[engine revs]

22:51.771 --> 22:54.638
[dramatic music]

23:05.818 --> 23:07.385
This is taking too long.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.619
[Arthur] Well
maybe you should've gone.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.687
Don't act like
you're okay with this.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.622
This is the path we chose.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.958
-Stick to your--
-I didn't choose this!
You have fucked us!

23:13.960 --> 23:17.027
-You think I like this?
-Hey, hey, hey, it's getting
too heated here. Calm down!

23:17.029 --> 23:19.897
-Fuck you!
-Calm the fuck down!
-Don't you ever fucking tell me

23:19.899 --> 23:21.632
-to calm down.
-[Arthur] I got us this far.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.568
Yeah, and you have
sealed us in this fucking tomb!

23:23.569 --> 23:25.503
-What the fuck
do you want me to do?
-We need to make a move!

23:25.505 --> 23:27.071
And not just sit around
with our thumb in our ass!

23:27.073 --> 23:29.407
-Do what exactly?
-Shoot our way out.

23:29.409 --> 23:32.042
-Get the fucking guns.
-We're getting too rash,
it hasn't been that long.

23:32.044 --> 23:36.680
I don't give a shit, I'm about
to ram the car into the
fucking gates. Goddammit!

23:36.682 --> 23:38.516
-We're killing the battery.
-[Gil] Got to be
fucking kidding me.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.151
[Wes] We've only been
in here for fucking ever.

23:40.153 --> 23:41.519
I don't need panic right now!

23:42.522 --> 23:43.721
The battery's fine
it's on the timer.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.055
The damn switch is in the cabin.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.524
This situation is perfect!

23:46.526 --> 23:48.125
-Get the guns--
-[shouting]

23:48.127 --> 23:49.860
-Shooting won't work!
-[Gil] Give me the goddamn--

23:49.862 --> 23:52.963
[all shouting]

23:54.534 --> 23:56.600
[horn honking]

23:56.602 --> 23:58.202
-It's Jimmy!
-Open the fucking gate.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.837
Everybody get ready, hurry.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.138
Let's make this
transition quick.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.640
Everyone out and load the bags.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.676
-Give me a hand.
-Let's go.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.811
Open the trunk.

24:08.181 --> 24:11.449
-Oh shit. What the fuck?
-They fucking shot me.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.751
-Arthur] Who?
-The fucking cops!
-The cops?

24:13.753 --> 24:16.187
-Yeah.
-Wait, they saw you?
They follow you?

24:16.189 --> 24:18.122
-[Jimmy] It was their car.
-What do you mean
it was their car?

24:18.124 --> 24:20.858
No, no, about halfway through
I saw the police shit

24:20.860 --> 24:21.959
but it was too late.
They were already there.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.128
You mean that car
belongs to cops?

24:24.130 --> 24:26.030
Out of every car in the city
you choose this one.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.165
-You're the one that
sent me there!
-What were you thinking?

24:28.167 --> 24:30.901
-Fucked this up.
-Oh, god, there were only
about five cars.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.971
[Wes] I don't understand.
Were they off duty,
undercover, what?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.506
It's a personal car.

24:35.508 --> 24:36.674
They won't find it.

24:36.676 --> 24:37.741
I wasn't followed.

24:37.743 --> 24:39.610
I swear.

24:39.612 --> 24:40.711
They see which way
you drove off?

24:40.713 --> 24:42.079
Yeah, they fucking shot me!

24:42.081 --> 24:43.013
[Wes] Fuck!

24:43.015 --> 24:46.817
Oh god, what kind of cop
doesn't have an alarm?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.886
-[Wes] Who were
these guys anyway?
-I dunno.

24:48.888 --> 24:52.490
The older guy had
a hip badge, wore a suit.

24:53.526 --> 24:57.661
-These case files are from
the counterfeiting ring.
-[Bruce] Let me see that.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.697
-This is the guy
who made the bust.
-Oh, fucking hell!

24:59.699 --> 25:03.133
[Wes] Well, I dunno,
maybe this'll distract
him from the heist?

25:03.135 --> 25:05.269
It all leads back to us!

25:06.038 --> 25:07.805
Pull out the ramps.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.140
We're putting the car inside.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.209
Fuck, let's go!

25:13.212 --> 25:14.812
[ramps scraping]

26:26.352 --> 26:28.819
-[door slams]
-[engine revs]

26:28.821 --> 26:31.689
[Jimmy panting]

26:31.691 --> 26:32.890
[Bruce] How bad is it?

26:32.892 --> 26:33.824
It fucking hurts!

26:33.826 --> 26:35.159
-Could be worse.
-Oh god.

26:36.329 --> 26:37.661
Take me to a doctor.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.298
You were gonna take Rafael.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.666
[Arthur] He was dying.

26:42.668 --> 26:45.603
[Jimmy groans]

26:45.605 --> 26:46.870
[Jimmy] I need a doctor!

26:46.872 --> 26:48.105
It's fucking killing me.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.908
[Arthur] You'll
be fine, you'll last.

26:50.910 --> 26:53.310
[Jimmy sobs]

26:54.880 --> 26:56.680
[Gil] We need to
get the fuck out of here.

26:56.682 --> 26:57.915
Yeah, we're all fucking aware.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.183
There are cops
circling this area.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.217
They will find us.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.252
How the fuck did this happen?

27:02.254 --> 27:04.121
You choose
the one fucking cop bar?

27:05.858 --> 27:07.024
Are we still meeting Cortez?

27:07.627 --> 27:08.659
'Cause we should fucking bail.

27:08.661 --> 27:09.693
[Arthur] No, we can make it.

27:09.695 --> 27:10.628
No, we can't.

27:12.098 --> 27:13.964
The highway's
the quickest route.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.066
I'm not going into the city,
that's where all the cops are.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.701
-[Arthur] It's the fastest way.
-[Gil] It exposes us.

27:17.703 --> 27:20.170
-We can make it.
-[Bruce] I dunno, it's risky.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.406
[Jimmy] None of
this matters, we're stuck.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.142
Look, we're not going
to steal another car, are we?

27:25.144 --> 27:26.710
That was a disaster.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.183
-Bruce, you need to try again.
-I can't drive this truck.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.285
Come on, if we thought he could
do it, we wouldn't've Jimmy.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.321
[Arthur] Someone
needs to try again.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.958
-I can't promise anything
different is gonna happen.
-Do it.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.094
Anything's better than sitting
here. Hey, I mean,
I'll take five miles an hour.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.429
[Bruce] I definitely
can not do the highway.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.931
I don't care.
Just fucking drive.

27:47.933 --> 27:49.400
-Shh, Wes, listen.
-Don't tell me--

27:49.402 --> 27:52.036
-Shh. You hear that?
-Hear what?

27:52.038 --> 27:53.771
-Quiet, quiet.
-I don't hear anything.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.039
Just wait, wait.

27:55.975 --> 27:58.809
[light knocking]

28:10.156 --> 28:11.889
The fuck is that?

28:12.992 --> 28:14.258
It stopped.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.793
Wait, wait, wait.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.232
[light knocking]

28:30.409 --> 28:32.976
It's a rock. Someone's
throwing rocks at our truck.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.079
Shh. Just be quiet.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.981
It's a fucking punk,
just let him pass.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.752
[suspenseful music]

28:41.754 --> 28:44.421
[light knocking]

28:47.293 --> 28:48.759
It's fine,
everything's gonna be fine.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.127
It's no big deal.

28:50.129 --> 28:53.430
[suspenseful music]

28:53.432 --> 28:54.331

Do you hear anything?

29:36.342 --> 29:39.409
[suspenseful music]

29:40.179 --> 29:41.478
I can't tell what he's doing.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.814
[door rattles]

29:43.816 --> 29:45.215
I think that was the front door.

29:45.518 --> 29:46.884
He's behind the wheel.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.820
He can't do much,
I got the keys.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.956
[suspenseful music]

30:04.136 --> 30:06.103
[wood scraping]

30:06.105 --> 30:08.539
He's at the wood.
What the fuck is he doing?

30:08.541 --> 30:09.940
[Gil]
Did the fuck find the hatchet?

30:09.942 --> 30:11.408
No, I doubt that.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.544
Then what the fuck
is he doing here?

30:13.546 --> 30:15.379
He's doing something.

30:15.381 --> 30:16.480
[metallic echoing]

30:16.482 --> 30:17.548
Fuck!

30:18.818 --> 30:20.450
[gate rattles]

[dramatic music]

30:24.557 --> 30:25.489
Hey!

30:26.325 --> 30:27.825
Get out of there!

30:27.827 --> 30:29.193
Look at him, fucker!

30:29.195 --> 30:31.495
[dramatic music]

30:31.497 --> 30:32.429
Hey!

Hey, I got it.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.295
Let's go.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.999
-Let's go.
-[Gil grunts]

31:17.443 --> 31:19.309
Fucker unplugged all
the brake lines and shit.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.111
Yeah, it's
probably why the fucking cops

31:21.113 --> 31:22.546
were here earlier.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.381
-Oh man!
-Where's this go?

31:24.383 --> 31:26.416
Without the proper tools,

31:26.418 --> 31:27.618
it'll be awhile.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.953
Well, how long is it gonna take?

31:29.955 --> 31:31.121
It's gonna take some time.

31:38.664 --> 31:41.031
[engine rumbles]

[ratchet clicking]

32:32.718 --> 32:34.685
[Jimmy] Hey, guys!

32:34.687 --> 32:37.054
We're almost done,
we're about to test the engine.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.256
[Jimmy] Guys, there's
someone watching us.

32:40.559 --> 32:43.593
[suspenseful music]

Guys!

[suspenseful music]

32:50.569 --> 32:52.736
-Oh, fuck that kid.
-[Jimmy] Who is that?

32:52.738 --> 32:54.972
He was the son of a bitch
rooting around under our hood.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.306
He pulled out
all the brake lines.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.240
Shit!

32:58.110 --> 33:00.310
Everyone in the truck!

33:00.312 --> 33:02.079
-Go, go, go.

-You're not being honest.

-Where are they fucking going?

46:27.919 --> 46:30.453
-I got you that. That's enough.
-No, I don't think so.

Motherfucker,
where is the rest of the money?

46:32.524 --> 46:34.290
Motherfucker, where is it, huh?

46:34.292 --> 46:37.126
Take me to them.

46:37.128 --> 46:38.461
Or I will kill you.

46:38.463 --> 46:41.497
Please.
You would've been arrested.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.166
[Arthur grunting]

46:48.039 --> 46:49.572
They left you behind, gringo.

46:49.574 --> 46:53.142
Are they worth protecting, huh?
Where are they?

47:17.235 --> 47:19.468
Why are we stopped? Keep moving.

47:19.470 --> 47:23.840
-There's traffic. I can't stop
and go in this thing.
-What about Arthur?

47:23.842 --> 47:25.875
He'll figure it out.
Come on, let's go.

47:25.877 --> 47:26.542
No, no, no!

47:26.544 --> 47:28.311
We can't leave him here.

47:28.313 --> 47:29.579
Do you think he got away?

47:29.581 --> 47:31.581
There's nothing we can do.

47:31.583 --> 47:34.450
[Bruce] Gil, if they
have him, they'll kill him.

47:34.452 --> 47:36.886
We haven't killed ours.

47:36.888 --> 47:38.187
What do you mean, you got one?

47:39.224 --> 47:40.923
That shit who broke our engine.

47:40.925 --> 47:42.592
[Bruce] That's great,
we can trade him for Arthur.

47:42.594 --> 47:44.260
[Wes] I don't know
how that would go down.

47:44.262 --> 47:46.128
Then we have to go back for him.

47:46.130 --> 47:48.264
There's no time.
There's nowhere to go back to.

47:48.266 --> 47:50.032
But we can still make this drop.

47:50.034 --> 47:52.535
Arthur got us this job.
What do you think's gonna happen

47:52.537 --> 47:54.470
when we show up without him?

47:54.472 --> 47:56.606
Do you know Cortez?
Does Cortez trust you?

47:56.608 --> 48:00.109
You don't even know his real
name. He might just
fucking kill us all.

48:00.111 --> 48:02.945
We won't meet him period
if we don't get
back on the road.

48:02.947 --> 48:05.514
Look, Arthur knows to go to
the harbor. He'll meet us there.

48:05.516 --> 48:07.450
Arthur would do it
for any of us.

48:07.452 --> 48:09.652
-He wouldn't take me
to the hospital.
-Shut the fuck up, Jimmy.

48:09.654 --> 48:12.121
-[Gil] Get
behind the wheel, Bruce.
-No.

48:12.123 --> 48:13.522
Get back behind
the fucking wheel!

48:13.524 --> 48:15.458
I am not gonna
drive through the strip.

48:15.460 --> 48:18.294
I'm either going back for
Arthur, or I'm going to the--

48:18.296 --> 48:19.929
Get on the damn highway!

48:19.931 --> 48:21.330
We can still do this exchange.

48:21.332 --> 48:23.165
You know what,
just fuck Cortez, all right?

48:23.167 --> 48:25.134
I don't care anymore.
Just go to the damn harbor.

48:25.136 --> 48:26.669
I'm not leaving
with this confetti money.

48:26.671 --> 48:27.670
[Wes] You were earlier.

48:27.672 --> 48:28.638
[Gil] Fuck you!

48:28.640 --> 48:30.606
Are we doing this or not?

48:30.608 --> 48:33.042
It's gonna be close
but we have a window.

48:33.044 --> 48:35.478
I can't do traffic!
What the fuck?

48:35.480 --> 48:38.514
We have agreed that
the city fucking exposes us.

48:38.516 --> 48:42.218
Every fucking cop is
back at our mess, Bruce.
Now's our chance!

48:42.220 --> 48:44.153
Oh yeah, I could crash.
Is that what you want?

48:44.155 --> 48:46.055
We need to go fucking now,
Bruce. We got no fucking time.

48:46.057 --> 48:47.490
Get to the front of the truck.

48:47.492 --> 48:49.225
Okay, if we backtrack

48:49.227 --> 48:50.459
I can get us out of the country,

48:50.461 --> 48:51.594
that's what I can do.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.529
We are going to the bus stop.

48:55.400 --> 48:56.632
All right.

48:56.634 --> 48:57.700
Then you guys drive.

do this for you, huh?

49:46.284 --> 49:47.316
Yes.

49:47.318 --> 49:48.451
Louder, come on!

49:51.622 --> 49:53.489
You better hope everyone's here.

49:54.425 --> 49:56.158
You see, that cop?

49:56.728 --> 49:58.728
He doesn't fuck around.

50:02.567 --> 50:04.667
You need to be gone

51:42.300 --> 51:43.799

Just let me go, man,
I won't say shit.

52:59.343 --> 53:01.410
I should fucking kill you.

53:01.412 --> 53:02.811
I was going to free you, man.

53:02.813 --> 53:06.348
Don't give me the fucking
[indistinct], give me
your Dakota and fast.

53:06.350 --> 53:10.286
-I don't have a fucking car.
-You have friends nearby?

53:10.288 --> 53:11.954
They all fucking run,
didn't you see that?

53:13.858 --> 53:16.358
You're the one who
got here, you fucker.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.860
They don't even know
my face, motherfucker.

53:17.862 --> 53:19.895
We shot at fucking cops.

53:21.265 --> 53:23.599
-Give me some money.
-You made me leave it
behind, remember?

53:23.601 --> 53:26.569
-Give me your fucking money.
Where's your wallet?
-I didn't grab shit, okay?

53:26.571 --> 53:28.771
-Not even a phone?
What the fuck?
-I didn't grab shit, okay?

53:29.974 --> 53:32.474
Step back!
Nothing, fucker, nothing.

53:32.476 --> 53:34.410

54:28.032 --> 54:30.833
-Nothing, man,
no one's answering, okay?
-Call another.

54:36.507 --> 54:38.507
They won't answer
a routed call, gringo.

54:38.509 --> 54:40.442
-Not after all this shit.
-Then call someone else.

54:40.444 --> 54:42.011
I don't know their numbers,
dude. I don't--

54:44.882 --> 54:46.649
Someone has to be close by.

54:46.651 --> 54:48.017
Well, we're not
near anybody I know.

54:49.353 --> 54:51.387
You're fucking
getting me out of this.

54:51.389 --> 54:52.821
You know what, fuck you, man.
I'm done with you.

54:52.823 --> 54:54.823
I can't help you with this shit.

58:35.880 --> 58:37.179
Go, forward!

58:37.181 --> 58:38.547
Drive.

58:38.549 --> 58:39.715
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

58:39.717 --> 58:41.283
Drive, forward, go, come on!

59:45.783 --> 59:46.915
You okay?

59:46.917 --> 59:47.849
Stay awake.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.752
How long are we
gonna wait for Arthur

59:50.754 --> 59:52.020
once we get to the docks?

59:53.791 --> 59:55.157
After our Cortez stop?

59:56.327 --> 59:57.759
He'll probably beat us there.

59:57.761 --> 59:58.927
If he doesn't?

59:58.929 --> 1:00:01.296
[Wes scoffs]

1:00:01.298 --> 1:00:03.799
You can't think like that.
It's Arthur.

1:00:03.801 --> 1:00:07.269
The longer we wait,
the more time the cops have.

1:00:08.339 --> 1:00:10.523
I know, I just don't want
to think about it right now.

1:00:10.524 --> 1:00:12.708
I don't like it either,
all right? But I just
think we should all agree

1:00:12.710 --> 1:00:18.347
-on something beforehand.
-I wait for him?

1:00:19.249 --> 1:00:21.683
Yeah,
I'd like to think I would too,

1:00:21.685 --> 1:00:23.018
but can't wait all night.

1:00:24.688 --> 1:00:26.755
Hang in there. You'll make it.

1:00:27.157 --> 1:00:29.057
Why don't you guys come back
and help with this?

1:00:36.233 --> 1:00:37.666
Got to get this money counted.

1:00:37.668 --> 1:00:39.067
Come on, each grab a bag.

1:00:41.105 --> 1:00:42.371
Why are we counting it?

1:00:43.941 --> 1:00:45.374
To see if Cortez notices

1:00:45.376 --> 1:00:47.843
that you just threw
away a chunk of his money.

1:00:56.153 --> 1:00:57.285
Stop the car then!

1:01:01.792 --> 1:01:02.924
Stop the car!

1:01:05.696 --> 1:01:06.428
Fuck.

1:01:09.366 --> 1:01:10.298
[shouts]

1:01:13.037 --> 1:01:14.903
Get out of the car!

1:01:20.044 --> 1:01:21.410
Where are we on this thing?

1:01:22.446 --> 1:01:23.412
Where are we?

1:01:23.414 --> 1:01:24.680
Where did we go, how far?

1:01:25.916 --> 1:01:26.848
Is this it?

1:01:28.185 --> 1:01:29.117
Is that right?

1:01:30.821 --> 1:01:32.754
Okay, use your goddamn finger

1:01:32.756 --> 1:01:35.090
and point on
the map where we are.

1:01:35.893 --> 1:01:39.461
-[fist thuds]
-[man grunts]

1:01:42.332 --> 1:01:43.799
[trunk slams]

1:01:47.304 --> 1:01:48.437
Oh, fuck!

1:01:49.139 --> 1:01:51.973
[bus rumbles]

1:01:57.347 --> 1:02:00.415
[suspenseful music]

1:02:20.838 --> 1:02:26.007
This can't be right.
What the fuck, man?
There's no way I lost this much.

1:02:26.009 --> 1:02:28.376
-Well, then we didn't have
enough money to begin with.
-I stuffed almost all of it

1:02:28.378 --> 1:02:30.746
-before Rafael was popped.
-Cortez is going
to fucking kill us.

1:02:30.748 --> 1:02:33.014
He won't fucking know.
Just spread it
among the other bags.

1:02:33.016 --> 1:02:35.383
No, we had a business agreement.
Arthur would uphold that.

1:02:35.385 --> 1:02:38.320
-Arthur's not here.
-You can't just lie
to a man like Cortez.

1:02:38.322 --> 1:02:40.756
He won't be able to
count it all, all right?
It'll take too long.

1:02:40.758 --> 1:02:42.124
-We--
-We have two goddamn minutes.

1:02:42.126 --> 1:02:43.358
He ain't going
to have enough time.

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:44.926
I say we just
tell him the truth.

1:02:45.262 --> 1:02:47.346
-You think that's
gonna work better?

1:02:47.347 --> 1:02:49.431
-I want my full cut, all right?
-We're not
delivering the full package!

1:02:50.768 --> 1:02:53.502
-Can't he just print more bills?
-I dunno. He has to rebuild.

1:02:53.504 --> 1:02:56.071
-I just don't want
to take that chance.
-He has to trust us, right?

1:02:56.073 --> 1:02:58.473
-That's why people hire Arthur.
-I get that. I get that,

1:02:58.475 --> 1:03:00.776
but we stole all of it.
His insiders will tell him that.

1:03:00.777 --> 1:03:03.078
No, I just don't want to take
that chance. What do you think
Bruce is gonna say

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:04.379
-about all this?
-We're not telling Bruce.

1:03:04.381 --> 1:03:05.814
We can't pull this off.

1:03:05.816 --> 1:03:07.516
Did you not hear
what Bruce just said?

1:03:07.518 --> 1:03:10.152
Without Arthur what's
stopping Cortez from killing us

1:03:10.154 --> 1:03:12.053
and taking all
the fucking money?

1:03:12.055 --> 1:03:13.455
Well, what's
stopping us from killing him

1:03:13.457 --> 1:03:15.457
and taking everything? Huh?

1:03:15.459 --> 1:03:18.560
-[dramatic music]
-[kick bangs]

1:03:40.150 --> 1:03:43.018
[dramatic music]

1:03:49.293 --> 1:03:50.559
[horn honking]

1:03:51.295 --> 1:03:52.427
Asshole!

1:04:12.182 --> 1:04:16.184
[suspenseful percussive music]

1:04:33.337 --> 1:04:35.370
Where the fuck did you take us?

1:04:35.372 --> 1:04:37.239
See,
that's why I needed the input.

1:04:37.241 --> 1:04:38.874
We have to get off
the highway at some point.

1:04:38.876 --> 1:04:39.641
None of these
roads look promising.

1:04:39.643 --> 1:04:41.509
I can't see shit. Fuck.

1:04:41.511 --> 1:04:43.912
Cortez is already waiting. Fuck!

1:04:43.914 --> 1:04:44.579
[Wes] Are we even close?

1:04:44.581 --> 1:04:46.181
I don't know this route.

1:04:46.183 --> 1:04:47.949
I got us close, a couple
of miles maybe, I dunno.

1:04:47.951 --> 1:04:49.251
Shouldn't there be
a bus coming through here?

1:04:49.253 --> 1:04:51.086
-No, this is the wrong road.

1:04:51.088 --> 1:04:53.154
But one of those
should connect to it.

1:04:53.156 --> 1:04:55.457
-Does he know?
-He doesn't know, but look,

1:04:55.459 --> 1:04:57.459
he recognizes
the name of the port,

1:04:57.461 --> 1:04:59.628
-so maybe he could take
us there if we backtrack.
-No, no, no.

1:04:59.630 --> 1:05:01.429
The cops are behind us, Bruce.

1:05:01.431 --> 1:05:03.098
We need to keep moving forward.

1:05:03.100 --> 1:05:04.432
Somebody's got
to make a decision.

1:05:04.434 --> 1:05:06.902
-We are so fucked.
-Which way is it, Bruce?

1:05:06.904 --> 1:05:09.204
-I want to say right
but I have no idea.
-Fine, perfect,

1:05:09.206 --> 1:05:14.075
we're going right then.
Let's go, come on. Everybody,
hurry up. Come on.

1:05:14.077 --> 1:05:15.210
Into the fucking truck.

1:05:18.582 --> 1:05:20.982
[animal warbles]

1:05:27.057 --> 1:05:28.523
[water rushing]

1:05:36.433 --> 1:05:39.334
[gravel crackles]

1:05:50.347 --> 1:05:51.680
[dramatic music]

1:06:08.098 --> 1:06:09.364
[knocking]

1:07:29.713 --> 1:07:32.113
[gate rattles]

1:07:33.083 --> 1:07:35.483
-Oh, goddammit, Bruce--
-I'm sorry.
-Enough!

1:07:35.485 --> 1:07:37.786
-Shit, are you sure--
-[Gil] Where the fuck
are we, Bruce?

1:07:37.788 --> 1:07:40.088
-Jesus Christ!
-I don't know.
We didn't scout this way

1:07:40.090 --> 1:07:42.424
-so nothing looks familiar.
-It all looks the same, Bruce,

1:07:42.426 --> 1:07:43.725
'cause it's a fucking desert!

1:07:43.727 --> 1:07:45.293
Yeah, what do you
want me to say, man?

1:07:45.295 --> 1:07:46.528
We should have
been there by now.

1:07:46.530 --> 1:07:47.595
[Jimmy] How long
before Cortez leaves?

1:07:47.597 --> 1:07:49.230
Look, just fuck it!

1:07:49.232 --> 1:07:50.498
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:51.800
We don't even know
where the fuck we are.

1:07:51.802 --> 1:07:53.068
Get back on track.

1:07:53.503 --> 1:07:54.602
No, we can't turn around

1:07:54.604 --> 1:07:55.470
there's no room for U-turns.

1:07:55.472 --> 1:07:56.504
Then keep fucking driving

1:07:56.506 --> 1:07:57.372
'cause it ain't here.

1:07:57.374 --> 1:07:58.706
Where do you think it is?

1:07:58.708 --> 1:08:00.308
It's got to be
out that direction.

1:08:00.310 --> 1:08:01.810
-We can't keep getting lost.
-What the fuck?

1:08:01.812 --> 1:08:03.144
Jesus fuck!

1:08:03.146 --> 1:08:04.212
[Bruce] Shit.

1:08:04.581 --> 1:08:07.315
[dramatic music]

1:08:22.499 --> 1:08:25.366
[dramatic music]

1:08:27.170 --> 1:08:29.237
[horn honking]

1:08:29.673 --> 1:08:30.705
Hey!

1:08:58.602 --> 1:09:01.469
[dramatic music]

1:09:19.789 --> 1:09:22.557
[dramatic music]

1:09:51.521 --> 1:09:54.722
[footfalls pattering]

1:09:56.626 --> 1:09:58.927
Hold it, whoa, whoa,
whoa, don't shoot, don't shoot.

1:09:58.929 --> 1:10:00.762
Don't shoot.
We have your money
right here in the bags.

1:10:01.865 --> 1:10:02.964
[Bruce] Don't shoot.

1:10:05.502 --> 1:10:08.369
[Bruce panting]

1:10:09.906 --> 1:10:10.872
Where's Arthur?

1:10:11.741 --> 1:10:12.674
Or Rafael?

1:10:16.980 --> 1:10:18.513
We had a rough start.

1:10:19.783 --> 1:10:21.616
But it's all fine.
It's all good now.

1:10:21.618 --> 1:10:23.351
You have nothing to worry about.

1:10:23.353 --> 1:10:25.887
-Where's my truck?
-It's fine.

1:10:25.889 --> 1:10:29.490
Since Rafael can't return it,
it will be left at the port.

1:10:29.492 --> 1:10:31.693
He's your man,
he's your problem.

1:10:32.762 --> 1:10:33.995
Are we doin' an exchange or not?

1:10:47.410 --> 1:10:48.910
It's all there.

1:10:50.313 --> 1:10:52.981
[dramatic music]

1:10:54.451 --> 1:10:57.652
-[Wes] We also
brought you the case files.
-I already have them.

1:11:07.631 --> 1:11:11.032
Arthur's pay
divided equally into six,

1:11:12.302 --> 1:11:13.601
by his request.

1:11:14.704 --> 1:11:16.004
We're five.

1:11:16.006 --> 1:11:18.373
Considered to be
a member of your team,

1:11:18.375 --> 1:11:21.876
Rafael was
meant to have a share.

1:11:21.878 --> 1:11:24.779
[dramatic music]

1:11:25.715 --> 1:11:26.948
He was your hire.

1:11:26.950 --> 1:11:28.349
You pay him.

1:11:28.351 --> 1:11:30.051
Those were
Arthur's instructions.

1:11:34.858 --> 1:11:36.557
Okay.

1:11:36.559 --> 1:11:37.959
His share goes to his family.

1:11:40.463 --> 1:11:42.430
[truck rumbles]

1:11:42.432 --> 1:11:45.400
There will be no
further contact from my end,

1:11:45.402 --> 1:11:47.468
and as you have
no way of reaching me,

1:11:47.470 --> 1:11:48.803
this ends our relationship.

1:11:53.576 --> 1:11:55.610
[suspenseful music]

1:12:06.723 --> 1:12:09.524
[truck rumbles]

1:12:19.102 --> 1:12:20.935
[Bruce] Oh fuck!

1:12:20.937 --> 1:12:22.637
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

1:12:22.639 --> 1:12:23.905
[Wes] What the fuck was that?

1:12:23.907 --> 1:12:25.840
-Oh shit.
-Jesus.

1:12:25.842 --> 1:12:28.643
[men muttering]

1:12:29.612 --> 1:12:31.079
-Are you all right?
-No.

1:12:52.969 --> 1:12:55.937
I can't fucking believe
you gave him Rafael's share.

1:12:55.939 --> 1:12:57.105
[Bruce]
What was I supposed to do?

1:12:57.107 --> 1:12:58.673
I wanted to get
the fuck out of there.

1:12:58.675 --> 1:13:00.675
-Shit!
-What the fuck?

1:13:03.146 --> 1:13:04.545
Jimmy, get up, Jimmy!

1:13:06.516 --> 1:13:07.815
Fuck, man.

1:13:07.817 --> 1:13:09.016
Told you to stay awake.

1:13:10.887 --> 1:13:13.154
Hey,
where'd that little shit go?

1:13:13.156 --> 1:13:14.655
You let him get away.

1:13:15.458 --> 1:13:17.625
Okay, I'll do
the driving, don't worry.

1:13:17.627 --> 1:13:19.160
All right,
next time don't fall asleep.

1:13:19.162 --> 1:13:20.661
[Bruce] Put
the worse behind you.

1:13:20.663 --> 1:13:21.529
Come on.

1:13:21.531 --> 1:13:22.463
Beautiful.

1:13:23.733 --> 1:13:27.535
So, no sign of Arthur?

1:13:27.537 --> 1:13:29.804
No, I was hoping
he'd be there but...

1:13:29.806 --> 1:13:32.173
No, come on,
let's get to the port.

1:13:32.175 --> 1:13:34.575
[Jimmy] All right.
Let's hope he beat us there.

1:13:37.881 --> 1:13:40.148
[engine rumbling]

1:14:08.478 --> 1:14:11.078
[phone ringing]

1:14:18.588 --> 1:14:19.620
Uh-huh.

1:15:47.677 --> 1:15:51.546
-There's nobody there,
they've been bought off!
-We have no authority there.

1:15:51.548 --> 1:15:53.214
And you have no
authority anywhere.

1:15:53.216 --> 1:15:54.949
-And you've been standing
in my fucking way!
-Fuck you,

1:15:54.951 --> 1:15:55.917
I've done
everything I should have.

1:15:55.919 --> 1:15:57.718
Then get the fucking answer!

1:15:57.720 --> 1:15:59.287
You brought me here
to solve this.

1:15:59.289 --> 1:16:00.755
This is how you do it!

1:16:00.757 --> 1:16:04.725
It's got to be done.
Are you gonna do
it or am I gonna do it?

1:16:04.727 --> 1:16:07.795
[suspenseful music]

1:16:24.781 --> 1:16:27.248
[engine revs]

1:17:44.894 --> 1:17:47.762
[dramatic music]

1:18:10.186 --> 1:18:12.920
[gate rattles]

1:18:13.756 --> 1:18:16.724
Wes, help Jimmy put
the money in the boat.

1:18:16.726 --> 1:18:19.860
Gil, I'll need help
backing this thing up.

1:18:19.862 --> 1:18:21.696
I don't want it
here in the open.

1:18:21.698 --> 1:18:23.197
We need to find a place for it.

1:18:24.267 --> 1:18:26.300
You really think someone's
gonna check this thing?

1:18:26.302 --> 1:18:27.702
I just want to be safe.

1:18:27.704 --> 1:18:29.970
We should
probably also grab Rafael.

1:18:29.972 --> 1:18:31.105
No loose ends.

1:18:32.475 --> 1:18:34.275
All right. Hey.

1:18:36.412 --> 1:18:39.780
You lose any of that
I'll fucking kill you.

1:18:39.782 --> 1:18:40.815
[Bruce] Okay, come on, let's go.

1:18:40.817 --> 1:18:41.749
Come on.

1:18:43.853 --> 1:18:44.785
[Gil grunts]

1:18:49.025 --> 1:18:50.891
[Jimmy] Arthur's not here.

1:18:50.893 --> 1:18:51.859
Shit, fuck.

1:18:52.995 --> 1:18:54.061
How long do we wait?

1:18:54.063 --> 1:18:54.995
I dunno.

1:18:57.500 --> 1:18:59.467
This is why I
brought it up earlier.

1:19:01.337 --> 1:19:03.037
Should we have
somebody wait for him?

1:19:03.973 --> 1:19:04.905
Fuck!

1:19:06.175 --> 1:19:07.508
How long are we gonna
be safe here, man?

1:19:07.510 --> 1:19:10.044
We didn't buy
out the port forever.

1:19:10.046 --> 1:19:11.412
He wouldn't leave without us.

1:19:11.414 --> 1:19:12.346
I get that.

1:19:16.152 --> 1:19:19.053
But listen, man, we don't know
if he's already caught or not.

1:19:19.055 --> 1:19:22.289
We'll figure something out.
We just have to
make a group decision.

1:19:25.962 --> 1:19:28.429
[dramatic music]

1:19:34.804 --> 1:19:36.203
It's a matter of waiting.

1:19:36.205 --> 1:19:38.339
He could be gone or
he thinks we're gone.

1:19:38.341 --> 1:19:39.473
Fuck!

1:19:41.944 --> 1:19:42.877
What's this?

1:19:49.886 --> 1:19:51.786
What's with the guns?

1:19:51.788 --> 1:19:53.087
Truck's yours, take it.

1:19:54.991 --> 1:19:56.457
Don't act innocent.

1:19:56.459 --> 1:19:57.391
Gimme my money.

1:19:59.228 --> 1:20:00.828
Our deal is over.

1:20:00.830 --> 1:20:02.496
No, our deal is over

1:20:02.498 --> 1:20:04.098
when I receive what I paid for.

1:20:04.100 --> 1:20:05.432
The fuck are you talking about?

1:20:05.434 --> 1:20:07.168
Don't fuck with me.

1:20:07.170 --> 1:20:10.004
Give me the rest of my money.

1:20:14.010 --> 1:20:16.177
You already stole Rafael's
share, don't pull this shit.

1:20:16.179 --> 1:20:17.545
No, I upheld my part.

1:20:17.547 --> 1:20:20.381
Okay, it's fine, it's all fine.

1:20:20.383 --> 1:20:21.448
We'll give you a bag.

1:20:23.386 --> 1:20:26.053
[Cortez laughs]

1:20:26.055 --> 1:20:31.225
I'll take all of it,<i> pendejo.</i>
I'm being reasonable here.
Had I known about it,

1:20:31.227 --> 1:20:32.893
I would've returned it to you.

1:20:32.895 --> 1:20:34.228
Only Arthur could,

1:20:34.230 --> 1:20:36.230
which is why
Rafael killed him for me.

1:20:36.232 --> 1:20:38.199
-I don't leave a trail.
-Fuck.

1:20:38.201 --> 1:20:40.534
Arthur was the only one
that tried to get
Rafael to a doctor.

1:20:42.071 --> 1:20:44.104
We never said Arthur was dead.

1:20:44.907 --> 1:20:46.106
Well then where the hell is he?

1:20:46.108 --> 1:20:47.074
Fuck you!

1:20:48.344 --> 1:20:49.443
Give me the rest of my money

1:20:49.445 --> 1:20:50.911
and tell me
where the fuck he is!

1:20:55.918 --> 1:20:57.251
You're outgunned,<i> pendejo.</i>

1:20:58.988 --> 1:21:00.087
You'll still die.

1:21:01.090 --> 1:21:04.191
[suspenseful music]

1:21:11.367 --> 1:21:14.201
Give me a bag and I'll leave.

1:21:14.203 --> 1:21:16.570
I'm not giving you shit.
Back away!

1:21:16.572 --> 1:21:18.305
You are gonna
honor our agreement.

1:21:18.307 --> 1:21:20.074
[Bruce] Arthur would
but you don't want him here.

1:21:20.076 --> 1:21:21.175
So you have to deal with us.

1:21:21.177 --> 1:21:23.077
You give me what's mine!

1:21:23.079 --> 1:21:24.211
I offered you a fair deal.

1:21:24.213 --> 1:21:26.213
We could have been gone by now.

1:21:27.884 --> 1:21:30.384
Who is that? Who is it?

1:21:30.386 --> 1:21:31.886
[Bruce] Not with us.

1:21:37.493 --> 1:21:38.659
Police!

1:21:38.661 --> 1:21:40.427
Weapons down, everyone.

1:21:42.064 --> 1:21:44.531
-Not happening.
-Backup is behind us.

1:21:44.533 --> 1:21:46.600
Weapons down!

1:21:46.602 --> 1:21:48.369
[Cortez] This
doesn't involve you.

1:21:49.138 --> 1:21:50.905
[officer] You behind this?

1:21:50.907 --> 1:21:53.073
Stop interrupting!

1:21:53.075 --> 1:21:54.041
You won't escape.

1:21:54.610 --> 1:21:56.110
Weapons down.

1:21:59.448 --> 1:22:00.447
Hey,

1:22:00.950 --> 1:22:02.549
we'll all kill them together.

1:22:02.551 --> 1:22:03.484
Hey?

1:22:04.387 --> 1:22:07.254
[dramatic music]

1:22:18.501 --> 1:22:19.566
Do it, shoot!

1:22:19.568 --> 1:22:20.634
Fuck that kid!

1:22:21.470 --> 1:22:23.203
[officer]
He wouldn't give you up.

1:22:23.205 --> 1:22:24.672
I don't believe you
and I don't care.

1:22:24.674 --> 1:22:26.340
He helped you.

1:22:26.342 --> 1:22:28.342
You wouldn't have made it
this far without him.

1:22:28.344 --> 1:22:30.177
He doesn't deserve to die.

1:22:36.519 --> 1:22:37.484
Come on!

1:22:38.187 --> 1:22:40.354
He'll shoot you after us.

1:22:40.356 --> 1:22:42.423
Guns on the ground, now!

1:22:43.626 --> 1:22:46.493

1:22:47.630 --> 1:22:49.363
[siren chirps]

1:23:00.343 --> 1:23:01.742
Only more will come.

1:23:03.012 --> 1:23:04.745
Now is the time to listen.

1:23:07.416 --> 1:23:08.515
This won't last.

1:23:09.552 --> 1:23:12.219
[dramatic music]

1:23:12.221 --> 1:23:14.722
Lower your guns.

1:23:14.724 --> 1:23:16.023
Enough of the interruptions.

1:23:16.025 --> 1:23:21.295
[laughs] You've never
been in control anyway. [laughs]

1:23:21.297 --> 1:23:24.164
[dramatic music]

1:23:28.537 --> 1:23:30.204

1:23:48.758 --> 1:23:51.025
Fuck you.

1:23:52.061 --> 1:23:53.127
[door rattles]

1:23:59.635 --> 1:24:00.601
What the fuck?

1:24:06.108 --> 1:24:07.541
[dramatic music]

1:24:09.145 --> 1:24:11.412
Get on the ground, now.

1:24:11.414 --> 1:24:13.347
Get down, I'll shoot.

1:24:15.317 --> 1:24:16.183
Kill him.

1:24:16.185 --> 1:24:17.818
Fuck you!

1:24:17.820 --> 1:24:18.819
He's a two-face fuck, Arthur.

1:24:18.821 --> 1:24:20.654
He tried to have you killed.

1:24:21.190 --> 1:24:23.323
[suspenseful music]

1:24:23.325 --> 1:24:24.258
All right.

1:24:27.530 --> 1:24:29.129
This is what's gonna happen.

1:24:35.071 --> 1:24:38.639
You know we all have
something that the other wants.

1:24:40.242 --> 1:24:41.642
We all value our lives more.

1:24:45.448 --> 1:24:50.717
So, we're all just gonna get
back in our vehicles and leave.

1:24:50.719 --> 1:24:53.787
[suspenseful music]

1:24:59.328 --> 1:25:01.295
It's that simple.

1:25:03.099 --> 1:25:04.531
I trust you not to shoot.

1:25:06.469 --> 1:25:07.534
You trust us.

1:26:38.327 --> 1:26:39.459
Can you walk?

1:26:39.461 --> 1:26:40.594
You got the keys?

1:26:40.596 --> 1:26:42.496
Jimmy, Jimmy has them.

1:26:42.498 --> 1:26:43.564

1:26:43.566 --> 1:26:44.498
The key.

1:26:46.302 --> 1:26:47.234
Toss the key.

1:26:47.236 --> 1:26:47.968
Fuck!

1:26:49.371 --> 1:26:50.470
We'll wait as long as we can.

-[Gil] He's behind us,
he'll come.
-We need to go now.

1:27:55.971 --> 1:27:58.538
-No, no, just wait.
-We're out of bullets.
-Give him time.

1:27:58.540 --> 1:28:00.407
We're not giving him time.
We need to go now.

1:28:00.409 --> 1:28:02.542

anyone behind!
-Bullshit, watch me!
