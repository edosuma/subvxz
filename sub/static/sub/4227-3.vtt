<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:03.064 --> 00:04.933
This was never
a negotiation.

00:04.958 --> 00:06.712
That's why we'll never stop
fighting you.

00:06.917 --> 00:09.009
Man strolls
onto an alien rocket,

00:09.034 --> 00:11.832
only to just come waltzing back
three months later.

00:11.857 --> 00:13.975
I hate what they did to me,
with all my heart and soul.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.725
I'm not the math geek
you used to push around.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.140
Put me
in restraints,

00:17.165 --> 00:18.949
I think they may have
done something to my mind.

00:18.974 --> 00:20.661
You should have put a
bullet in the back of his head

00:20.686 --> 00:22.603
the second he took a step
towards that ship.

00:22.628 --> 00:23.559
It's moving.

00:35.666 --> 00:36.799
See anything?

00:36.834 --> 00:38.434
Nope.

00:38.468 --> 00:40.502
Well, keep looking.

00:40.537 --> 00:42.505
We're only supposed to
be patrolling

00:42.539 --> 00:44.441
two clicks from
the perimeter.

00:44.475 --> 00:46.643
Don't worry.
I know my way back to camp.

00:46.678 --> 00:48.946
See that?

01:04.430 --> 01:07.331
Got him!
Nice shot.

01:21.913 --> 01:24.548
Oh, that's nasty.

01:24.583 --> 01:26.017
12 gauge will do that.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.497
I thought it was dead.

01:39.531 --> 01:41.799
It is now.

02:10.526 --> 02:13.362
He insisted on sleeping with it.

02:13.396 --> 02:15.530
Don't worry.
I made sure it's unloaded.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.001
Where's Ben?
He's on patrol.

02:20.035 --> 02:21.903
- That's two nights  in a row.
- He and Jimmy, they're a good team.

02:21.970 --> 02:24.371
They got each other's backs.
There's nothing to worry about.

02:26.774 --> 02:28.008
You should get some sleep.

02:28.042 --> 02:29.409
You're on perimeter at 0600,
aren't you?

02:29.477 --> 02:30.710
Don't remind me.

02:30.745 --> 02:32.345
When is Weaver putting you back
on the line?

02:32.379 --> 02:33.780
I'm gonna go talk to him
about it right now.

02:33.814 --> 02:35.348
Good.

02:35.382 --> 02:36.716
Night.

02:36.750 --> 02:40.553
If he's still feverish
in the morning, come find me.

02:40.587 --> 02:42.522
Hey.
Hey.

02:42.556 --> 02:44.658
Give me a hand?
Sure.

02:44.692 --> 02:47.928
This hangar is a perfect storm
for infection transmission.

02:47.995 --> 02:50.697
Close quarters and a cold,
drafty environment.

02:50.731 --> 02:52.699
It's a wonder I don't have
a line of pneumonia cases

02:52.734 --> 02:53.901
outside my door.

02:53.935 --> 02:55.669
We've been here
over a week.

02:55.703 --> 02:57.938
Besides being sick,
people are getting restless.

02:58.006 --> 03:00.074
I know.
It's not a good situation.

03:00.108 --> 03:01.876
I'm going a little
stir-crazy myself.

03:01.910 --> 03:03.677
That's why I'm gonna
talk to Weaver,

03:03.712 --> 03:05.946
try to convince him that
we need to move out of here

03:06.014 --> 03:07.714
sooner than later.
Good.

03:07.749 --> 03:09.416
No, save it
for somebody else.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.451
I'd rather give you
a blanket now

03:11.485 --> 03:12.719
than antibiotics later.

03:12.753 --> 03:14.521
I have plenty of blankets.

03:14.555 --> 03:15.722
Thanks.

03:15.756 --> 03:17.724
Just doing my job.

03:17.758 --> 03:19.426
You should get
some sleep, Anne.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.294
Sleep?
What's that?

03:21.363 --> 03:23.397
Seriously.
You look beat.

03:23.431 --> 03:25.099
Might say the same thing
about you.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.701
In fact,
you look terrible.

03:26.735 --> 03:28.770
What?
Sorry.

03:28.804 --> 03:30.539
You look great.
Really?

03:30.573 --> 03:31.540
No.

03:33.443 --> 03:36.446
It's nice
to hear you laugh.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.915
Yeah. It's been a while
since I've wanted to.

03:42.385 --> 03:44.319
Midnight.

03:44.387 --> 03:46.788
Excuse me.
Sorry.

03:51.793 --> 03:53.961
It's good that you keep track
of the days.

03:53.996 --> 03:56.130
Somebody's got to.

03:56.164 --> 03:58.766
The way I see it is
every day I mark off

03:58.800 --> 04:01.636
is another day we're still here,
still alive.

04:01.670 --> 04:03.838
That's a lot of X's.

04:03.873 --> 04:04.906
Yes.

04:04.941 --> 04:06.641
It's a good thing.
It is.

04:06.676 --> 04:08.410
Really good.

04:12.582 --> 04:14.650
I got to go see
Captain Weaver.

04:14.685 --> 04:15.985
Let me know
what he says, okay?

04:16.019 --> 04:17.486
Of course.
Of course.

04:22.492 --> 04:25.061
Recon has spotted
massive alien formations

04:25.095 --> 04:26.963
in the Hudson Valley,
combing the countryside.

04:26.997 --> 04:29.599
They got to be looking for us,
'cause there's nobody else here.

04:29.633 --> 04:30.934
Yeah.

04:30.968 --> 04:32.135
And we've seen twice
the number of Beamer patrols

04:32.169 --> 04:33.937
since we crossed
the Housatonic.

04:33.971 --> 04:35.702
So it's only a matter of time
before they find us, then.

04:35.703 --> 04:36.657
Agreed.

04:36.682 --> 04:38.682
So we got to move.
The question is where.

04:39.109 --> 04:41.510
We'll push north
into the Catskills.

04:41.545 --> 04:43.512
I rode through those hills
from Michigan.

04:43.546 --> 04:44.646
There's nothing up there.

04:44.681 --> 04:46.181
Which is why it'll be
a good place

04:46.215 --> 04:48.416
for us to bed down
for the winter.

04:48.450 --> 04:50.451
Captain,
with all due respect,

04:50.485 --> 04:52.853
if we're resting,
we're not resisting.

04:54.556 --> 04:55.856
Look out there, Tom.

04:55.890 --> 04:58.826
Our people have given
everything to this fight.

04:58.860 --> 05:00.628
Half our fighters are gone.

05:00.662 --> 05:02.029
And once the Mercury drops,

05:02.063 --> 05:04.866
I can't see us fighting Skitters
and the weather

05:04.900 --> 05:06.000
at the same time.

05:06.035 --> 05:08.069
They'll think
we've surrendered.

05:09.706 --> 05:11.206
You of all people
should know

05:11.241 --> 05:13.209
that there's a big difference
between retreat and surrender.

05:13.243 --> 05:14.844
To us, but not to them.

05:14.878 --> 05:16.812
Believe me, if we disappear
up into the hills,

05:16.847 --> 05:18.581
crammed together
like matchsticks,

05:18.615 --> 05:21.450
freezing our asses off
instead of pressing the fight,

05:21.485 --> 05:23.452
we're doing exactly
what they want.

05:23.487 --> 05:24.854
Your concern is noted.

05:24.888 --> 05:27.022
Jamil needs a few more days
to repair the vehicles,

05:27.056 --> 05:29.124
and then we head north
to the Catskills.

05:31.161 --> 05:33.028
Yes, sir.

05:51.515 --> 05:52.649
Pope ?

05:52.683 --> 05:55.986
Professor.
Ain't it a lovely night?

05:56.020 --> 05:58.487
- What are you doing out here?
- Waiting for you.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.094
You sure about this, boss?

06:04.128 --> 06:05.628
Yeah, I'm sure.

06:05.663 --> 06:07.530
Let's get this alien stooge
out of here

06:07.564 --> 06:09.799
before he causes
any real damage.

06:22.297 --> 06:25.166
Sorry for all the dramatics,
Professor.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.967
What's this all about?

06:27.002 --> 06:30.271
I think you know.

06:30.305 --> 06:33.240
I don't know what
your alien friends did to you,

06:33.274 --> 06:35.576
but I for one
do not want to find out.

06:35.611 --> 06:38.179
Since you and I go
way back,

06:38.213 --> 06:40.648
I'm gonna give you the chance
to do the honorable thing

06:40.682 --> 06:42.450
and walk away.

06:42.484 --> 06:44.051
Just like that?

06:44.086 --> 06:47.021
You expect me to walk away
from the 2nd Mass?

06:47.055 --> 06:49.923
Just like that.

06:49.957 --> 06:51.925
And what?
Leave my boys in your care?

06:51.959 --> 06:55.128
Your boys will be looked after
as if they were my own.

06:55.163 --> 06:58.398
That's a promise.
Even the spiky one.

06:58.432 --> 07:00.334
Unless, of course,
he goes full Skitter,

07:00.368 --> 07:01.601
and then all bets are off.

07:01.636 --> 07:03.403
You're not gonna get away
with this.

07:03.437 --> 07:05.605
Oh, I think I will.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.208
You'd be surprised
how many people back at camp

07:08.243 --> 07:10.477
are creeped out
over your triumphant return.

07:10.511 --> 07:14.481
Not so many people will miss you
as you might think.

07:14.515 --> 07:17.718
So do us all a favor.
Start walking.

07:24.491 --> 07:26.092
I said move!

07:26.126 --> 07:28.361
What the...

07:28.395 --> 07:30.363
Drop your weapons!
Ben.

07:30.397 --> 07:32.665
I said drop 'em.

07:34.568 --> 07:37.369
He won't miss next time.

07:42.474 --> 07:44.108
Hey, Professor Mason.

07:44.143 --> 07:46.644
Jimmy.
What are you doing out here?

07:46.678 --> 07:48.446
On our way back from patrol.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.583
You are a long way from the
outer perimeter there, lizard --

07:53.219 --> 07:55.553
I'm just glad you're here.

07:55.588 --> 07:56.988
Jimmy, grab that rifle.

07:57.023 --> 07:58.457
We'll take it back
to camp.

07:58.491 --> 08:00.126
What are we gonna do about them?

08:00.160 --> 08:02.428
That's for Captain Weaver
to decide.

08:07.601 --> 08:09.469
You didn't know anything
about this, Anthony?

08:09.503 --> 08:11.271
No, sir.

08:11.305 --> 08:13.440
Look, Pope was smart enough
to keep me out of the loop.

08:13.474 --> 08:15.009
He knew I wouldn't
let it happen.

08:15.043 --> 08:17.244
Cap, come on.

08:18.714 --> 08:21.516
I think Pope and his Berserkers
have outlived their usefulness.

08:21.551 --> 08:23.151
Agreed.
They're out of control.

08:23.186 --> 08:24.686
When we move out
for the catskills,

08:24.720 --> 08:26.488
we leave them all behind.

08:26.522 --> 08:28.089
Lyle, Tector, Crazy Lee --
they're just following orders.

08:28.124 --> 08:30.158
They're not the problem.
Pope's the problem.

08:30.192 --> 08:32.427
Wait a minute.
I'm not defending what Pope did.

08:32.462 --> 08:34.129
But the man does have
a point.

08:34.163 --> 08:35.763
Tom, no offense,
but no one knows

08:35.798 --> 08:37.799
what the aliens might have done
to you.

08:37.833 --> 08:40.769
No, no, no. Dr. Glass
removed whatever it was.

08:40.803 --> 08:43.539
Or we just found
what they wanted us to.

08:43.573 --> 08:46.174
I'm just saying that Pope
isn't the only one wondering

08:46.209 --> 08:48.643
if Tom is a walking
time bomb.

08:48.678 --> 08:51.312
He's right.
Anthony's right.

08:51.346 --> 08:54.214
We can't be 100% certain
what they did to me.

08:54.248 --> 08:56.183
I could still pose a threat
to the group.

08:56.217 --> 08:57.717
Dad, there's no way
you're a threat --

08:57.752 --> 08:59.418
But we've lost a lot
of fighters.

08:59.453 --> 09:01.454
The 2nd Mass isn't exactly in
a position to be picky.

09:01.488 --> 09:03.189
The benefit
of giving me a weapon

09:03.256 --> 09:05.457
outweighs the risk
of me being a liability.

09:05.491 --> 09:07.092
Wouldn't you say, Captain?

09:07.126 --> 09:08.727
That's how I see it, yes.

09:08.761 --> 09:10.162
Well, then the same
has to hold true for Pope.

09:10.196 --> 09:11.497
You lost me there, Tom.

09:11.531 --> 09:12.731
We need him.

09:12.766 --> 09:14.600
For better or worse,
they listen to him.

09:14.635 --> 09:16.503
And the Berserkers
do the things

09:16.537 --> 09:18.605
that the rest of us can't
or won't.

09:18.639 --> 09:21.208
We've given Pope
too many chances already.

09:21.242 --> 09:24.378
- Something has got to change.
- Agreed.

09:26.648 --> 09:28.783
Assign me
to the Berserkers.

09:30.486 --> 09:33.555
If I know where he is,
I can keep my eye on him.

09:36.225 --> 09:37.692
So?

09:39.295 --> 09:42.664
Permission to join
the Berserkers, Captain?

09:50.206 --> 09:51.473
Fine.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.575
Permission granted.

09:57.380 --> 09:58.380
Fresh air!

09:58.415 --> 09:59.882
Listen up.

09:59.916 --> 10:01.417
I'd like nothing better

10:01.451 --> 10:03.252
than to leave you stewing
in your own filth.

10:03.286 --> 10:06.188
But after speaking with Tom,
I have a proposition for you.

10:06.223 --> 10:09.225
Tom Mason.
Savior of the 2nd Mass.

10:09.259 --> 10:11.327
I'm assigning Tom
to the Berserkers.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.739
Are you insane?

10:21.773 --> 10:23.306
I don't know.

10:23.341 --> 10:24.741
If I am, I guess
we'll have that in common.

10:28.179 --> 10:29.680
The fatal mistake here,
cap,

10:29.714 --> 10:31.582
is assuming
that I am the enemy.

10:31.616 --> 10:35.385
How quickly you forget
it was me and my crew

10:35.420 --> 10:38.255
pulled the 2nd Mass' ass
out of hell in Fitchburg.

10:38.290 --> 10:41.159
No, I haven't forgotten.

10:41.193 --> 10:42.861
But you have a tendency
to forget

10:42.895 --> 10:45.564
that I am the commander
of this regiment, not you.

10:45.598 --> 10:47.366
Mason here
turns us all over

10:47.400 --> 10:49.702
to the alien overlords,
what then, sir?

10:49.736 --> 10:51.637
I think you're probably
gonna have to get used to

10:51.671 --> 10:53.373
kissing Skitter butt.

10:53.407 --> 10:55.909
In the meantime, I'm assigning
Tom to the Berserkers.

10:55.943 --> 10:57.477
And if I refuse?

10:57.511 --> 11:00.480
In that case,
get used to that farm-boy aroma,

11:00.548 --> 11:02.950
'cause I'm gonna shut this door,
we're gonna lose the key.

11:04.686 --> 11:07.554
Welcome
to the Berserkers.

11:14.562 --> 11:16.229
What are they doing?

11:16.263 --> 11:17.430
I don't know.

11:17.465 --> 11:19.733
And there's no Mechs
with them.

11:19.767 --> 11:23.304
That's weird.

11:23.338 --> 11:26.340
The one with the red eye
creeps me out.

11:27.376 --> 11:30.612
Is that one of the Berserkers'
dragon breath rounds?

11:30.646 --> 11:32.513
Yeah. One of Pope's
pyrotechnic rounds.

11:32.548 --> 11:34.415
Bye-bye, buckshot.
Hello, flamethrower.

11:34.450 --> 11:35.584
I've got two of them.

11:35.618 --> 11:36.885
Let's toast
some cockroaches.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.954
Yeah.

11:38.988 --> 11:40.623
Okay.

11:44.929 --> 11:47.697
Wait for it.

11:51.269 --> 11:53.370
Wait for it.

11:54.905 --> 11:57.406
Wait for it.

12:01.544 --> 12:02.577
Now!

12:19.059 --> 12:20.859
Aah!

12:23.563 --> 12:24.997
Jimmy!

12:50.057 --> 12:51.724
Jimmy.

12:53.093 --> 12:55.328
Jimmy!

12:57.464 --> 12:59.932
You're gonna be okay.

13:02.536 --> 13:04.570
Let me see.

13:09.434 --> 13:11.185
Good thing you left
the branch still in place.

13:11.210 --> 13:13.029
He would've lost
a lot more blood otherwise.

13:13.309 --> 13:15.033
Give me the tray
and a lot more gauze.

13:15.058 --> 13:16.200
Okay. Got it.

13:16.201 --> 13:17.337
Scissors.

13:19.901 --> 13:22.235
Let's get out of here
and give them some room to work.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.703
I'm not leaving him.

13:23.738 --> 13:26.706
- I'm not leaving him.
- Hey. We need to talk, son.

13:38.486 --> 13:41.754
What in the hell were you two
doing out there, Ben?

13:44.992 --> 13:47.293
Hunting Skitters.

13:47.328 --> 13:48.929
Hunting?

13:48.963 --> 13:50.497
Is that what you were doing
when you found dad last night?

13:50.564 --> 13:52.966
What were you and Jimmy doing
hunting Skitters, Ben?

13:55.302 --> 13:58.437
They put spikes on my back.
They killed mom.

13:58.472 --> 13:59.605
They killed everybody.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.407
I need a reason?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.209
Like we don't see
enough combat?

14:03.243 --> 14:04.777
You have to go
looking for it?

14:04.812 --> 14:08.948
Till every last one
of those things is dead, yes.

14:13.252 --> 14:15.620
Hal, take your brother back to
the tent and get him cleaned up.

14:15.655 --> 14:16.955
No. I'm going back
to the med bus.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.657
You can't walk around camp
looking like that.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.792
Go change first.

14:41.413 --> 14:43.980
I never should've let
those two go out on patrol

14:44.015 --> 14:45.448
three nights in a row.
I'm his father.

14:45.483 --> 14:46.816
I didn't even know
he was on patrol.

14:46.851 --> 14:49.919
I should've been paying
better attention.

14:49.954 --> 14:51.922
I can't protect them anymore.
We can't protect them anymore.

14:51.956 --> 14:53.590
All we can do
is prepare them

14:53.624 --> 14:55.559
for the world
that's in front of them,

14:55.627 --> 14:57.995
and it's a world where kids
have to grow up too fast.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.866
And there's gonna be
consequences

15:01.901 --> 15:04.936
and there's gonna be
casualties.

15:04.971 --> 15:08.674
I wish that that gave me
some comfort, Tom.

15:08.709 --> 15:10.810
But it doesn't.

15:10.844 --> 15:12.812
No.
Me either.

15:14.815 --> 15:17.817
We need to make sure that
our location is still secure.

15:17.851 --> 15:19.885
Wake Pope up
from his beauty sleep,

15:19.920 --> 15:21.720
have the Berserkers
sweep the area.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.855
Yes, sir.

15:29.861 --> 15:32.564
Well, there's
a pretty sight.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.299
Oh, they got these two
real good.

15:35.334 --> 15:38.002
Blackened Skitter. Yum.

15:38.037 --> 15:40.472
That's our
dragon's breath.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.342
Little bastards
used our ammo.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.585
What do you got there?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.054
It's Jimmy's compass.

15:55.088 --> 15:58.323
Well, there's no Skitters
for 100 miles.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.461
Take up defensive positions
in those trees. Go! Go! Go!

16:03.495 --> 16:05.462
What?
Now.

16:09.733 --> 16:12.736
What the hell is the matter
with you, Mason?

16:15.840 --> 16:18.943
Let's light 'em up.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.645
No. Hold your fire.

16:21.780 --> 16:23.981
Did you just give my guys
an order?

16:24.016 --> 16:25.951
They're just collecting
their dead.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.555
Tector. Lyle.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.557
Blow their heads off.
No. Don't. Don't. Don't.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.892
Do it!
No, don't.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.565
Well, crap.

16:45.771 --> 16:49.440
Just let them get
what they came for.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.517
Well, <i>that</i> was damn close.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.786
Good call, Tom.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.688
Yeah.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.192
Good call.

17:17.702 --> 17:21.704
Why are you staring at me
like that?

17:21.739 --> 17:23.873
I'm not staring.

17:23.907 --> 17:25.942
Yeah, you are.
You got something to say?

17:25.976 --> 17:28.044
- Yeah, I do.
- Easy now, boys.

17:32.516 --> 17:35.551
I'm gonna get
some coffee.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.861
You okay?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.964
Yeah. Me? I'm fine.
It's Ben I don't get.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.398
What was he thinking?

17:47.466 --> 17:49.000
He could put the whole 2nd Mass
at risk.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.136
Yeah, well, if they followed him
back to the airport,

17:51.170 --> 17:52.571
I'm sure we'd know
by now.

17:52.605 --> 17:53.939
Oh, you're making excuses
for him?

17:53.973 --> 17:56.876
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm just saying...

17:56.910 --> 17:59.111
You know, Ben's in a world
of pain right now.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.113
And you mad-dogging him
like that

18:01.147 --> 18:02.715
is not gonna solve
the problem.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.883
Give him some slack.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.119
Give yourself some slack.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.520
Any news?

18:08.555 --> 18:10.222
He's still in surgery.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.858
Hey, we ran into
a Skitter patrol.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.727
But they were heading
the other direction.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.095
I think we're safe.
But for how long?

18:17.163 --> 18:18.730
I don't know.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.999
Hey.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.734
The compass.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.937
Give it to Jimmy
when he wakes up.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.746
How is he?

18:34.781 --> 18:37.249
I've done everything I can.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.017
It's up to Jimmy now.

18:39.051 --> 18:42.521
Jimmy's a fighter.
Always has been.

18:46.627 --> 18:48.995
Hal, go after him.
Make sure he's okay.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.276
Did you find him?
No.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.779
He's not in any of the buildings
on the west side of the airport.

19:06.813 --> 19:10.482
You ever think maybe it's time
to quit chasing after him?

19:10.550 --> 19:12.050
What do you mean?
Ever since we were kids.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.753
Ben would leave his toys
or his books or whatever

19:14.788 --> 19:16.255
all around the house.

19:16.290 --> 19:18.591
You'd come right behind him
and you'd clean it up.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.892
You can't clean this up.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.661
That isn't
what this is about.

19:21.695 --> 19:24.064
No? Really? Because--

19:54.064 --> 19:58.668
Well, hello there.
Who do we have here?

19:59.737 --> 20:02.840
2nd Massachusetts.
Captain Dan Weaver.

20:02.874 --> 20:05.577
And who, may I ask,
are you?

20:05.611 --> 20:09.715
The name's Avery Churchill.
I've been looking for you.

20:16.213 --> 20:18.587
I've been flying over
a 50 square mile search area

20:18.589 --> 20:20.223
for the past week and a half
trying to find you.

20:20.257 --> 20:22.258
where did you
come from?

20:22.292 --> 20:24.460
I'm one of four pilots who left
Charleston, South Carolina,

20:24.495 --> 20:25.695
in search of survivors.

20:25.730 --> 20:26.997
We each took
a compass point and --

20:27.031 --> 20:29.699
On whose orders?

20:31.435 --> 20:33.770
Direct orders from
the Continental Congress.

20:33.805 --> 20:36.506
Are you saying there's
a government in Charleston?

20:36.540 --> 20:39.209
Elected by almost 3,000
civilians in the new capital.

20:39.243 --> 20:41.678
How have you been able to fly
with all the Beamers around?

20:41.712 --> 20:44.213
I fly low -- just a few
hundred feet above the ground.

20:44.248 --> 20:46.282
And the aircraft's
made of spruce, plywood,

20:46.316 --> 20:49.218
and a fiberglass cloth skin,
so radar's not an issue.

20:49.252 --> 20:51.086
The plane's a neat trick.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.554
But the important thing is to
get your asses to Charleston.

20:52.588 --> 20:55.657
What's the state of the military
in Charleston?

20:55.725 --> 20:57.692
We've been assimilating
the disparate militias

20:57.726 --> 20:59.260
that popped up post-invasion.

20:59.294 --> 21:01.295
But re-establishing
a unified central command

21:01.329 --> 21:03.531
is key to taking back
the planet.

21:03.565 --> 21:05.566
You mean you've made contact
with other parts of the world?

21:05.600 --> 21:07.367
In Europe, yes,
via shortwave radio.

21:07.402 --> 21:09.536
In fact, my mission is
to continue heading north,

21:09.571 --> 21:11.272
making contact with as many
survivors as possible,

21:11.306 --> 21:12.506
until I hit Greenland.

21:12.541 --> 21:14.308
Then hop over Iceland
to the U.K.

21:14.342 --> 21:16.176
And ultimately
the rest of Europe.

21:16.211 --> 21:18.579
With all due respect,
what proof do you have

21:18.614 --> 21:20.581
that anything you've said
is true?

21:20.616 --> 21:22.550
I get you.
Is it a leap of faith?

21:22.585 --> 21:24.219
Hell, yeah.

21:24.253 --> 21:27.189
But if it's nothing that
interests you, no harm, no foul.

21:27.223 --> 21:28.657
I'll just be on my w--

21:28.692 --> 21:30.760
I'm sorry, but we can't risk
you giving away our location,

21:30.794 --> 21:32.329
intentionally or otherwise.

21:32.363 --> 21:34.298
I'm going to have to ask
that you stay with us

21:34.332 --> 21:36.834
until we move out.
You're detaining me?

21:36.868 --> 21:40.071
Think of it as a layover
on your way to Greenland.

21:40.105 --> 21:41.339
And my plane?

21:41.373 --> 21:43.341
You and your plane
will be safe.

21:43.375 --> 21:45.310
You have my word.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.813
Well, don't get any fancy ideas
about stealing her.

21:47.847 --> 21:49.080
She's booby-trapped.

21:49.114 --> 21:50.548
Noted.

21:50.583 --> 21:53.251
In the meantime, I hope
that you will accept

21:53.285 --> 21:55.185
a limited hospitality.

21:55.220 --> 21:59.823
Hal, would please accompany our
honored guest to the mess tent?

21:59.857 --> 22:01.324
Yes, sir.

22:02.493 --> 22:04.227
What do you think?

22:04.261 --> 22:05.762
Charleston sounds like
a much better option

22:05.796 --> 22:07.797
than the Catskills --
warmer, anyway.

22:07.831 --> 22:11.401
Charleston is a long way to go
on a wing and a prayer.

22:11.435 --> 22:14.204
What do you --
what? A Continental Congress?

22:14.239 --> 22:15.873
You buy that?

22:15.907 --> 22:17.708
I don't know.

22:17.743 --> 22:20.312
But if it's true...

22:20.346 --> 22:22.147
That would really be
something.

22:22.181 --> 22:24.382
We've been promised
paradise before.

22:24.417 --> 22:26.518
There's no way to know
for sure.

22:26.552 --> 22:28.687
Unless we go.

22:28.721 --> 22:30.422
I got to go find Ben.

22:30.490 --> 22:33.158
Let me know if there's
any change with Jimmy.

22:33.193 --> 22:34.193
Yeah.

22:50.776 --> 22:53.278
Where did you go?

22:53.312 --> 22:54.612
Nowhere.

22:54.647 --> 22:58.582
Just walking around,
staring at Jimmy's compass.

22:58.617 --> 23:03.687
A few months back, he got
separated from the 2nd Mass.

23:03.721 --> 23:05.789
It took two days
to find him again,

23:05.823 --> 23:07.557
so Weaver gave him
his compass

23:07.591 --> 23:09.559
so he could always find
his way home.

23:09.593 --> 23:11.561
Don't blame yourself
over this.

23:11.595 --> 23:13.429
Everyone else does.

23:13.464 --> 23:14.831
That's not true.

23:14.865 --> 23:17.501
I've seen the way
everyone looks at me.

23:17.535 --> 23:19.769
Hal, Matt...

23:19.803 --> 23:21.171
even you.

23:21.205 --> 23:22.572
No.

23:22.607 --> 23:24.641
Yes.
No.

23:24.675 --> 23:26.243
Fine. Whatever.

23:26.277 --> 23:29.280
But do you think
I wouldn't rather be lying there

23:29.314 --> 23:30.581
instead of him?

23:30.615 --> 23:32.883
I'm sure that you would.

23:34.352 --> 23:37.855
Just like there isn't a day
that goes by

23:37.889 --> 23:40.857
that I don't wish and pray that
your mother was still alive.

23:40.891 --> 23:44.827
And it, um, sucks.

23:44.862 --> 23:46.396
It really sucks.

23:46.430 --> 23:49.332
Sometimes you think
that you can't even go on.

23:49.366 --> 23:52.735
Except you don't have a choice
but to go on.

23:52.769 --> 23:55.504
And the good news
is that we've got each other

23:55.572 --> 23:57.639
to get through
a lousy situation.

23:58.775 --> 24:01.843
The bad news is...

24:01.878 --> 24:04.479
...it's a lousy situation.
...It's a lousy situation.

24:07.350 --> 24:09.818
I'm not saying
it's a paradise. Far from it.

24:09.852 --> 24:12.320
But there are people
all helping each other.

24:12.354 --> 24:14.655
And there's electricity
and hot water.

24:14.690 --> 24:16.357
There's hot water?

24:16.391 --> 24:17.625
How is that possible
with all those people?

24:17.659 --> 24:19.627
All I know is that every day,

24:19.661 --> 24:21.429
we get a little closer
to normal.

24:21.463 --> 24:23.764
I mean, before I left,
I went to a wedding.

24:23.798 --> 24:26.199
How's Jimmy doing?
No change.

24:26.267 --> 24:27.934
But as soon
as his condition improves,

24:27.969 --> 24:30.336
we need to be ready
to move out.

24:30.371 --> 24:32.471
- What's the status of the convoy?
- All the military vehicles are ready.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.306
Some of the multi-purpose
vehicles still need repair,

24:34.341 --> 24:35.541
but it shouldn't be
too much longer.

24:35.609 --> 24:36.843
Good.

24:36.877 --> 24:37.944
We still only have enough
snow chains

24:37.978 --> 24:39.512
for half the convoy,
though.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.514
Maybe we don't
need 'em now.

24:41.548 --> 24:44.250
I mean, no need for snow chains
in Charleston, right?

24:44.285 --> 24:46.253
Keep looking.

24:46.287 --> 24:47.721
We're gonna need
snow chains.

24:47.788 --> 24:50.023
Those mountain roads are gonna
be dangerous without chains.

24:50.057 --> 24:51.858
So you're still thinking
the Catskills?

24:51.893 --> 24:54.795
Hot showers and white weddings
make for a good story.

24:54.830 --> 24:56.230
But we're gonna need
more than that

24:56.298 --> 24:57.999
if we're gonna survive
the winter.

24:58.033 --> 25:00.335
Yes, sir.

25:05.809 --> 25:08.677
I've heard a lot about you,
Professor Mason.

25:08.712 --> 25:10.679
You've got some story.
Oh?

25:10.713 --> 25:11.880
I've never met anyone

25:11.914 --> 25:13.415
who was taken aboard
an alien mother ship

25:13.449 --> 25:14.549
and lived
to talk about it.

25:14.584 --> 25:17.385
It happened.
Doesn't make it a story.

25:17.419 --> 25:19.386
We need people like you
in Charleston, Tom,

25:19.421 --> 25:21.388
to help rebuild
this country.

25:21.422 --> 25:24.257
I'm just a history teacher.

25:24.325 --> 25:25.725
And I was a manager
at the Carpet Corral.

25:25.759 --> 25:28.394
But now look at me now.
I'm Paul Revere in a prop plane.

25:28.428 --> 25:29.896
Don't sell yourself short.

25:29.930 --> 25:31.531
These people don't.

25:40.574 --> 25:42.876
Anne, Jimmy's not breathing!

25:50.351 --> 25:54.054
I can't find a pulse.
I need an amp of epinephrine.

25:57.025 --> 25:58.726
What happened?

25:58.760 --> 26:00.595
I don't know.
Not today.

26:00.629 --> 26:02.764
Come on, Jimmy.

26:02.798 --> 26:04.299
I can't do this alone.

26:04.367 --> 26:08.370
Come on, Jimmy.
Not today.

26:20.782 --> 26:22.883
Why are you stopping?!

26:22.917 --> 26:24.885
No. No. Keep going!
Keep doing it!

26:24.919 --> 26:27.921
I'm sorry.
He's gone.

26:48.243 --> 26:51.312
I'm very sorry
for your loss, Captain.

26:58.120 --> 27:00.187
We break camp at dusk.

27:00.255 --> 27:03.324
You're free to leave
at any time, Ms. Churchill.

27:03.358 --> 27:04.825
So I'm released
from your custody?

27:04.860 --> 27:07.128
It was never that.
Just being cautious.

27:07.162 --> 27:08.763
I understand.

27:09.798 --> 27:12.167
You know, I've met more than
a few people in your position

27:12.201 --> 27:13.501
since I started
this mission.

27:13.535 --> 27:16.437
And some call themselves
Lieutenant or Captain.

27:16.472 --> 27:18.105
But more often than not,

27:18.140 --> 27:21.209
their people refer to them
as something less flattering.

27:23.145 --> 27:25.780
Want to know
what your people call you?

27:25.814 --> 27:27.315
What is that?

27:27.349 --> 27:29.150
Their leader.

27:31.886 --> 27:35.055
I know it's a lot
to bear.

27:35.123 --> 27:39.059
But know the 2nd Mass would
follow you to the gates of hell.

27:39.093 --> 27:42.462
Take your people to Charleston,
Captain.

27:42.497 --> 27:45.299
They need you there.

27:45.333 --> 27:49.536
And honestly, I think
your people need Charleston.

27:56.945 --> 27:59.013
Good luck, Ms. Churchill.

28:18.933 --> 28:21.903
What happened
to his field vest?

28:21.937 --> 28:24.472
Couldn't get the blood out.
Didn't think it was right.

28:24.506 --> 28:27.909
Oh. It's okay.
He looks fine the way he is.

28:38.089 --> 28:39.490
What's wrong?
Jimmy's compass.

28:39.524 --> 28:41.292
It's gone.

28:50.135 --> 28:52.535
We should be packing up to leave
like the others.

28:52.570 --> 28:54.871
There you go
barking orders again, Mason.

28:54.905 --> 28:56.906
Not an order.
Just a statement of fact.

28:56.941 --> 28:58.441
We'll start packing
when we're good and ready.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.142
Right now
it's cocktail hour!

29:00.210 --> 29:02.944
Why don't you pull up a tire
there and join us?

29:02.979 --> 29:04.579
Captain Weaver's orders
are pretty clear.

29:04.614 --> 29:06.481
We're moving out
after Jimmy's funeral.

29:06.548 --> 29:07.615
Yeah.

29:07.650 --> 29:09.384
Well, I think
we're all gonna pass

29:09.418 --> 29:11.119
on that incredibly empty
gesture.

29:11.153 --> 29:13.421
God, you're an asshole,
Pope.

29:17.491 --> 29:19.325
Well, been called worse --

29:19.393 --> 29:21.828
and far more eloquently,
I might add.

29:21.895 --> 29:24.397
But because I am
your senior commanding officer,

29:24.431 --> 29:30.336
I hereby give you permission to
attend that poor boy's memorial.

29:31.438 --> 29:33.505
And you can gently put
your arms

29:33.540 --> 29:35.908
around that half-breed son
of yours

29:35.942 --> 29:38.978
and tell him it was
a good thing, what he did,

29:39.012 --> 29:41.313
killing one
for the Skitter team.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.984
Where did you get that?

29:49.955 --> 29:51.857
Finders keepers.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.158
Take it off.

29:53.193 --> 29:54.593
No.

29:54.628 --> 29:56.462
I said take it off.

29:56.497 --> 29:58.298
You know,
I'm getting really tired

29:58.332 --> 29:59.966
of you telling me
what to do.

30:00.001 --> 30:02.470
It's not like, uh, Jimmy's
gonna need it, you know.

30:04.039 --> 30:06.307
Oh!

30:11.447 --> 30:14.016
Ooh. Ooh.

30:22.959 --> 30:24.158
Take it off!

30:24.193 --> 30:26.561
You want it?
Come and get it.

30:37.238 --> 30:39.373
Tom. Tom. Tom!

30:40.241 --> 30:41.975
Okay. Okay. That's enough!
That's enough!

30:42.009 --> 30:45.245
He's had it.
That's enough, man.

30:59.659 --> 31:01.426
Mason!

31:01.494 --> 31:04.429
You son of a bitch!

31:04.497 --> 31:07.031
Mason, this isn't over!

31:10.102 --> 31:11.936
This is crap.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.439
Mason disobeyed a direct order
and then attacked me.

31:14.507 --> 31:16.142
The way I hear it,

31:16.176 --> 31:18.110
Tom made the right call
last night with those Skitters.

31:18.145 --> 31:20.113
And as far as the fight,
if it had been me,

31:20.181 --> 31:21.715
I'm not sure
I'd have left you standing.

31:21.749 --> 31:23.550
So let's call it even.

31:23.585 --> 31:25.620
Have you forgotten?

31:25.687 --> 31:29.057
The man had a chip...

31:29.092 --> 31:32.160
in his head!

31:32.194 --> 31:35.430
That and his freak-show son
had Jimmy killed.

31:35.464 --> 31:37.198
Enough.

31:37.232 --> 31:39.767
You said your piece.
You know what?

31:39.801 --> 31:43.004
Me and my crew -- I think we've
carried your water long enough.

31:43.038 --> 31:45.006
You want out?

31:45.040 --> 31:46.741
There's the door.

31:50.280 --> 31:52.181
Let's get out of here.

31:53.817 --> 31:56.586
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

31:57.555 --> 32:00.123
Let's go.

32:07.266 --> 32:10.768
Screw you all.

32:12.505 --> 32:14.272
Hold up.

32:16.642 --> 32:19.443
I'll go with you, Pope.
I owe you.

32:20.479 --> 32:23.682
Finally.
Someone with some brains.

32:25.484 --> 32:27.184
See you at the bikes.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.321
You don't have to
do that.

32:30.355 --> 32:32.089
I think I do.

32:32.123 --> 32:34.658
As crazy as it sounds,
the man did save my life.

32:34.692 --> 32:38.194
Besides, someone has to make
sure that he doesn't double back

32:38.262 --> 32:40.030
and give the 2nd Mass
any more grief, right?

32:40.097 --> 32:43.366
The man's a danger to himself
and to everyone around him.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.468
Are you sure
that's where you want to be?

32:45.502 --> 32:48.204
No.

32:48.238 --> 32:50.139
But that's where I'm going.

32:53.644 --> 32:55.846
You'll be missed,
Anthony.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.848
Thank you, sir.

32:57.883 --> 32:59.550
Take care of your boys.

32:59.618 --> 33:03.355
Yeah.
Keep your eye on Pope.

33:03.390 --> 33:05.324
Yeah. I will.

33:08.795 --> 33:10.629
Take a shower.

33:10.664 --> 33:12.365
Yeah.
With your mama.

33:12.399 --> 33:15.068
Man, I thought I was
the crazy one.

33:15.136 --> 33:17.171
My brother.

33:28.151 --> 33:29.718
Are you okay?

33:29.752 --> 33:32.654
Aside from the fact that I
almost killed Pope, I'm fine.

33:32.689 --> 33:33.655
What?

33:33.690 --> 33:35.557
I lost it.

33:36.593 --> 33:41.264
He took Jimmy's compass,
and...I snapped.

33:43.401 --> 33:45.402
Let me take a look at you.

33:52.276 --> 33:53.910
Sorry.

33:55.212 --> 33:57.280
You did a pretty good job.
I had a good teacher.

33:57.314 --> 33:59.581
You've patched me up
enough times.

34:10.458 --> 34:13.594
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't --

34:13.629 --> 34:16.330
No.
It's okay.

34:19.935 --> 34:21.835
It's just that it's...

34:21.871 --> 34:24.539
it's Sammy's birthday
today.

34:28.344 --> 34:30.746
All I wanted was...

34:30.780 --> 34:34.616
for no one to die
on his birthday.

35:09.476 --> 35:11.577
How do you measure somebody?

35:11.612 --> 35:13.979
How do you define their worth?

35:14.014 --> 35:18.951
A year ago,
Jimmy was just a boy.

35:18.986 --> 35:21.321
Just a little boy.

35:21.355 --> 35:23.323
And then it all changed.

35:23.357 --> 35:24.724
His world fell apart.

35:24.759 --> 35:26.059
He had to step up.

35:26.094 --> 35:28.562
He had to leave
that little boy behind.

35:28.596 --> 35:31.766
He had to become a soldier.
He had to learn how to fight.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.601
And he did.

35:33.636 --> 35:39.707
And he is now defined by those
of us who owe him our lives.

35:39.741 --> 35:42.610
He is measured by his bravery.

35:47.382 --> 35:49.617
This day came too soon.

35:49.651 --> 35:52.486
He died too young.

35:53.721 --> 35:58.024
But he died a hero to me.

36:00.361 --> 36:03.964
And I am proud to have served
with him.

36:05.634 --> 36:10.405
Jimmy...we'll remember.

36:16.581 --> 36:21.517
May the next world be kinder
to Jimmy than this one ever was.

36:26.624 --> 36:28.491
We'll make it
through this.

36:28.559 --> 36:29.926
All right, bro?

37:29.455 --> 37:32.590
Sorry to bother you,
Captain.

37:33.525 --> 37:36.427
It's no bother, son.

37:36.462 --> 37:39.464
I'm sure Jimmy would appreciate
the company.

37:41.134 --> 37:44.102
I just, uh,
wanted to, um...

37:47.540 --> 37:51.910
I know Jimmy would have
wanted you to have this back.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.479
Right.

37:56.749 --> 38:00.018
My father gave me this
when I was an eagle scout.

38:00.052 --> 38:03.889
I always meant to give it
to my daughter Jeanne

38:03.923 --> 38:06.725
but never got a chance.

38:06.759 --> 38:08.559
Thanks.

38:08.594 --> 38:11.729
Yeah. Well...
sure came in handy for Jimmy.

38:11.763 --> 38:13.998
That it did.

38:14.032 --> 38:15.799
He was a good soldier,
that boy,

38:15.834 --> 38:17.668
but he had no sense
of direction.

38:20.738 --> 38:23.807
He had no sense
of d-direction at all.

38:23.841 --> 38:27.176
No, sir. He did not.

38:28.846 --> 38:35.717
I wouldn't have wanted
anyone else by my side fighting.

38:42.625 --> 38:44.059
I'm sorry.

38:44.794 --> 38:47.596
Hey, there's nothing
to be sorry about, son.

38:48.631 --> 38:50.065
Hey.

38:50.099 --> 38:51.900
You're going to be fine.

38:51.934 --> 38:52.934
Ben.

38:52.968 --> 38:54.602
Ben.
I'm sorry.

38:54.637 --> 38:57.773
You're going to be fine.
I'm sorry.

38:59.309 --> 39:01.243
We're going to be fine.

39:01.277 --> 39:02.544
Yes, sir.

39:04.113 --> 39:05.814
I'm sorry.

39:10.721 --> 39:13.056
Happy Birthday, Sammy.

39:22.967 --> 39:25.168
Charleston's a long ways
away, people!

39:25.202 --> 39:27.203
Make sure we don't leave
anything behind!

39:27.237 --> 39:28.871
Are we ready?

39:28.905 --> 39:31.206
Last van's loaded.
All present and accounted for.

39:31.241 --> 39:33.141
176 souls.

39:33.175 --> 39:35.210
176 it is.

39:37.146 --> 39:39.581
Captain, you mind if I ask you
a question?

39:39.615 --> 39:41.983
- What made me change my mind.
- Yeah.

39:42.018 --> 39:47.089
When I first took command
of the 2nd Mass, we were 300.

39:47.124 --> 39:49.626
300 strong, Tom.

39:49.660 --> 39:52.829
Now 176.

39:52.864 --> 39:55.666
We owe it to Jimmy
and to everybody that we've lost

39:55.700 --> 39:56.934
to stay in the fight.

39:56.968 --> 39:59.202
We're just pissing
in the wind here.

39:59.270 --> 40:01.771
We need to get back
in the war.

40:01.805 --> 40:04.774
Seems like Charleston might be
a good place to do that.

40:04.808 --> 40:07.943
Besides, a hot shower
doesn't sound too bad.

40:07.977 --> 40:10.678
Highways are clear.
So are all the back roads.

40:10.713 --> 40:12.012
All right.
Where's Ben?

40:12.047 --> 40:13.280
I'll find him.

40:13.315 --> 40:15.816
Let's move out.

40:15.850 --> 40:17.817
Let's go!

40:17.851 --> 40:21.955
Get those engines fired up!
Get ready to move!

40:22.990 --> 40:24.123
Go!

40:24.158 --> 40:26.026
Ho!

40:29.364 --> 40:30.230
Move!

40:30.298 --> 40:31.732
Let's go!

40:31.766 --> 40:33.166
Come on! Let's go!

41:18.213 --> 41:19.914
Ben? You out here?

41:19.949 --> 41:21.182
Over here.

41:37.099 --> 41:39.100
You all right?

41:39.135 --> 41:41.703
