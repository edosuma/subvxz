00:00.420 --> 00:02.420
Previously on Greenleaf.

00:02.427 --> 00:04.766
Any fresh libel in the paper
about us this morning, Jacob?

00:04.820 --> 00:07.354
Just this Friday feature
about churchgoers in the DA's office,

00:07.355 --> 00:09.355
Written by this Darius Nash?

00:09.380 --> 00:11.740
I really don't know
how all this is gonna end.

00:11.768 --> 00:13.848
<i>And all the side deals that he's making.</i>

00:13.881 --> 00:16.471
I can't lose half the deacon
board over a choir director.

00:16.504 --> 00:18.550
You knew I was gay.
All this has got to be about

00:18.584 --> 00:19.959
Reggie and I getting married.

00:19.992 --> 00:21.590
<i>It's a program for guys</i>

00:21.624 --> 00:23.146
who are dealing with a similar issue.

00:23.170 --> 00:25.526
<i>We wanted the bishop
to do this wedding.</i>

00:25.560 --> 00:27.958
You never would have been
my first choice.

00:27.992 --> 00:31.030
<i>Zora snuck out of the conference
and Sophia covered for her.</i>

00:31.064 --> 00:33.110
<i>I want to get baptized.</i>

00:36.087 --> 00:38.070
<i>Kevin and Charity
might be divorcing.</i>

00:38.103 --> 00:40.086
We will be seeking your guidance.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.398
Do you have a lawyer yet?

00:41.432 --> 00:43.287
When you get one, have him call me.

00:46.584 --> 00:47.831
<i>It was rated number one</i>

00:47.863 --> 00:49.751
most beautiful college in the country.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.655
I'm sure it's very beautiful.

00:52.407 --> 00:54.871
Yeah. And it says here
they have a very good

00:54.904 --> 00:56.471
religious studies program.

00:56.503 --> 00:58.331
Is that what you want to study?

00:58.839 --> 01:01.687
You already know what your major
is, sweetheart?

01:01.719 --> 01:03.126
Maybe.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.367
I don't know.

01:05.559 --> 01:07.816
It'd be so simple
to just go to college here.

01:08.439 --> 01:10.615
Would you please, please,
please just give me the money

01:10.647 --> 01:12.439
for the application fee?

01:12.471 --> 01:14.527
Well, Rhodes might be
the simplest option, sweetheart,

01:14.551 --> 01:16.951
but that doesn't make it the best one.

01:16.984 --> 01:18.264
Are you trying to get rid of me?

01:18.295 --> 01:19.894
No.

01:19.928 --> 01:21.910
I just know college is a big choice.

01:21.944 --> 01:24.086
I want you to think big, honey.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.040
Going to the most beautiful
campus in the country

01:26.071 --> 01:27.670
seems pretty big.

01:27.704 --> 01:29.910
Well, life is more than beauty.

01:34.168 --> 01:37.974
You got a lot of spice
this early, baby.

01:38.008 --> 01:39.446
Parentals.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.626
- I'm making eggs.
- No, thank you.

01:41.659 --> 01:43.319
I'll go with a yogurt.

01:43.351 --> 01:45.943
So, here's the thing.

01:45.975 --> 01:47.222
Yes?

01:47.256 --> 01:49.110
I would like to have a reexamination

01:49.143 --> 01:51.447
of this "no dating" policy.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.759
It's not a "no dating" policy.

01:52.791 --> 01:56.151
It's a "no reprobate thug" policy.

01:56.183 --> 01:59.127
Isaiah's not a thug.
He's in a gospel group.

01:59.159 --> 02:01.174
- He's Christian.
- He's a Christian thug.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.286
That's a thing.
Now, your father used to be one

02:03.320 --> 02:06.263
before I straightened him out.

02:06.295 --> 02:08.150
Just give him another chance.

02:08.184 --> 02:09.110
No.

02:09.144 --> 02:10.582
One week with that boy,

02:10.615 --> 02:12.534
and you were lying and sneaking around.

02:12.568 --> 02:13.791
Don't make him pay for my mistakes.

02:13.815 --> 02:15.734
I'm the one with the problem here.

02:15.767 --> 02:16.886
What are you thinking?

02:16.920 --> 02:19.191
What... what are you thinking?

02:21.208 --> 02:23.094
I would like to invite him

02:23.128 --> 02:25.142
to Sophia's birthday party.

02:25.175 --> 02:27.158
No lying, no sneaking.

02:27.191 --> 02:29.239
Just good, clean Christian fun.

02:30.712 --> 02:31.712
Two peas in a pod.

02:35.191 --> 02:37.431
As long as you don't leave the premises.

02:37.463 --> 02:39.959
Look at us... learning, growing.

02:39.991 --> 02:41.942
I got to say, you two,

02:41.976 --> 02:45.078
I am proud to be part of the process.

02:47.544 --> 02:50.326
And, as stipulated
in our memorandum of understanding,

02:50.359 --> 02:52.535
Mr. Satterlee will be responsible

02:52.567 --> 02:54.390
for his debts incurred
during the marriage?

02:54.423 --> 02:56.150
That's correct.

02:56.184 --> 02:58.486
And the same for Miss Greenleaf?

02:58.519 --> 03:01.398
Yes, and you'll find that all broken
down in today's addendum.

03:01.432 --> 03:04.694
And finally, in the matter
of Nathan Satterlee,

03:04.727 --> 03:07.158
both parties agree to joint custody?

03:07.192 --> 03:09.656
Yeah, but we have one question.

03:10.263 --> 03:14.358
It looks like I'll be going
to Nashville fairly regularly,

03:14.391 --> 03:16.406
more often than I originally thought.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.471
Is that right?

03:17.504 --> 03:20.118
Kevin, what Charity might suggest

03:20.151 --> 03:21.622
might actually be a blessing.

03:21.655 --> 03:23.190
Remember...

03:23.223 --> 03:25.758
look for God's hand at work
in what you fear the most.

03:25.791 --> 03:27.926
- I'm looking.
- I just wanted to know

03:27.960 --> 03:29.960
if we could change
the visitation language

03:29.961 --> 03:32.072
to make more space for flexibility.

03:32.106 --> 03:33.673
So you can run off with Jabari?

03:33.705 --> 03:35.912
I'm not running off with Jabari.

03:35.946 --> 03:37.961
Kevin, I'm pursuing my career.

03:37.993 --> 03:39.128
With another man in Nashville.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.495
Well, what do you care?

03:43.114 --> 03:44.456
Why don't we stop for today?

03:46.000 --> 03:52.074

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

04:36.050 --> 04:38.865
Kevin. Kevin.

04:42.770 --> 04:44.656
He knows about your songwriting, right?

04:44.690 --> 04:46.353
- This publishing deal?
- Yes.

04:46.385 --> 04:47.898
Okay, so then what was that all about?

04:47.922 --> 04:50.033
Who knows?

04:50.065 --> 04:52.369
Your mom asked me to look out
for you and the family here.

04:52.401 --> 04:53.977
If there's something
I should be aware of

04:54.001 --> 04:55.482
- that could potentially hurt...
- There isn't.

04:55.506 --> 04:57.177
So there's nothing going on
between you and Jabari

04:57.201 --> 04:59.728
- that Kevin could use...
- No!

04:59.761 --> 05:02.577
Kevin's just... I don't know.

05:02.609 --> 05:04.048
I shouldn't have said it.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.985
Shouldn't have said what?

05:08.017 --> 05:09.489
Nothing.

05:11.697 --> 05:13.104
Thanks for your help.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.476
- No?
- No.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.824
Oy. But thanks for coming along.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.680
I don't feel like
I'm being much of a help,

05:25.714 --> 05:29.072
but I was expecting to at least
have to, like, look under a hood.

05:29.106 --> 05:31.769
No, it's nice just to have another human
being to turn to occasionally

05:31.793 --> 05:33.520
who isn't trying to sell me a car.

05:33.554 --> 05:35.313
Well, you are here to buy one.

05:35.345 --> 05:37.552
Yeah, I know. I don't blame them.

05:37.586 --> 05:42.096
It's just so oppressive to me... sales.

05:42.130 --> 05:44.913
You know, I think of that poor caveman

05:44.945 --> 05:46.649
sitting there with the dead
bird that he found,

05:46.673 --> 05:49.136
just sitting and waiting
for somebody to walk by

05:49.169 --> 05:50.704
to sell it to.

05:50.737 --> 05:52.401
For what?

05:52.433 --> 05:54.224
- What do you mean?
- Like, sell it for what?

05:54.258 --> 05:56.337
Like, for what money

05:56.369 --> 06:01.648
in this prehistoric
capitalistic fantasy of yours?

06:02.962 --> 06:05.136
I don't know. A piece of fire?

06:05.170 --> 06:06.768
Okay, a piece of fire.

06:06.802 --> 06:07.824
Whatever.

06:07.858 --> 06:09.136
A sharp rock. Come on.

06:09.170 --> 06:10.256
A sharp rock.

06:10.289 --> 06:11.697
And then the next day,

06:11.729 --> 06:13.168
there's another caveman next door

06:13.201 --> 06:14.873
who's sitting there
with his own dead bird.

06:14.897 --> 06:16.976
I just think it's all
so lonely, you know?

06:19.793 --> 06:21.520
Yeah.

06:21.554 --> 06:25.137
Isn't there a verse in Genesis
that justifies working?

06:25.169 --> 06:26.608
Yeah, as punishment.

06:26.641 --> 06:28.313
But even then, it's supposed
to be work that involves

06:28.337 --> 06:30.444
the sweat of the brow, not selling.

06:30.994 --> 06:34.064
Something went wrong.
More wrong than it had to go.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.136
And then sales.

06:37.169 --> 06:38.960
You should preach about that.

06:38.993 --> 06:41.424
I wouldn't know what to say.

06:41.458 --> 06:42.832
You just said it.

06:46.162 --> 06:47.952
Well, this isn't the car.

06:52.401 --> 06:54.416
So...

06:54.449 --> 06:58.256
what would I have to do to get
you in my car tomorrow night?

06:58.289 --> 07:01.617
It's Sophia's birthday.

07:01.649 --> 07:04.016
- Hence the car.
- Yup, hence the car.

07:04.049 --> 07:08.304
And my mother's insisted on this
whole thing at the house,

07:08.338 --> 07:10.480
which I haven't invited you to.

07:13.905 --> 07:14.961
I wasn't going to say it.

07:14.993 --> 07:17.104
Would you want to come?

07:17.137 --> 07:19.496
Are you ready to spring me on the folks?

07:20.753 --> 07:21.840
Because if you're not, I...

07:21.874 --> 07:23.216
No, no, no. Let's do it.

07:23.249 --> 07:24.528
Let's do it.

07:24.562 --> 07:26.416
Let every adverse force converge.

07:29.425 --> 07:30.769
So, what do I get her?

07:31.919 --> 07:34.032
Some fuzzy dice?

07:34.065 --> 07:35.569
All right, I'll see what I can do.

07:35.601 --> 07:37.233
Can I help you folks today?

07:37.265 --> 07:39.184
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- This is a heck of a car.

07:39.217 --> 07:41.776
Yeah, I know. Thank you. I'll take it.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.120
Okay, then.

07:43.154 --> 07:44.656
I'll get the paperwork.

07:50.091 --> 07:51.344
So, how did the morning go?

07:51.377 --> 07:52.816
As well as can be expected.

07:52.850 --> 07:54.608
Tell me more.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.218
I think he's going to try
for sole custody.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.968
Well, that will never happen.

07:58.002 --> 08:00.496
He knows. He's just angry.

08:00.530 --> 08:03.184
Well, why are the two of you
breaking up?

08:03.217 --> 08:04.369
Why does that matter, Mama?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.832
Because if Kevin cheated on you...

08:06.865 --> 08:08.182
He didn't!

08:09.105 --> 08:11.463
<i>He didn't do anything.</i>

08:13.362 --> 08:14.929
And promise me there is nothing

08:14.961 --> 08:17.648
between you and this Lafcadio boy.

08:17.681 --> 08:19.440
- Jabari?
- Jabari.

08:19.473 --> 08:21.136
No, there isn't.

08:21.169 --> 08:22.513
I'm the good sister, remember?

08:22.545 --> 08:23.888
My Lord.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.342
So, what is it, then?

08:28.246 --> 08:29.937
For nearly a year, the two of you

08:29.969 --> 08:31.568
have been at odds.

08:31.601 --> 08:34.895
Back and forth on the sofa,
out the house, back in.

08:34.929 --> 08:36.751
What is it?

08:38.544 --> 08:41.679
Charity, are you prepared
to lose custody of your child

08:41.714 --> 08:45.008
over the questionable pleasure
of keeping a secret?

08:47.313 --> 08:49.072
Are you?

08:50.481 --> 08:52.144
Because...

08:54.705 --> 08:57.904
everything will come out
sooner or later.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.953
There is not a pocket of darkness

08:59.985 --> 09:01.552
that the light of God won't find.

09:01.585 --> 09:02.929
Have you not read your Bible?

09:02.961 --> 09:03.961
Mama.

09:06.257 --> 09:09.520
Charity, what pain has this man caused?

09:10.976 --> 09:13.264
Therefore, since we are
receiving a kingdom

09:13.297 --> 09:15.696
that cannot be shaken,
let us be thankful

09:15.729 --> 09:17.329
and so worship...

09:17.361 --> 09:19.184
Pastor Greenleaf.

09:19.217 --> 09:21.104
- Should I come back?
- No, no, no. Come on in.

09:21.137 --> 09:22.809
Just let me get to the end
of this verse here.

09:22.833 --> 09:25.040
And so worship God acceptably
with reverence and awe,

09:25.073 --> 09:27.537
for our God is a consuming fire.

09:27.569 --> 09:29.616
- Hebrews 12.
- Yes, indeed.

09:29.649 --> 09:32.337
Eight more books, I'm going
to have this baby memorized.

09:32.369 --> 09:34.513
How can I be of assistance?

09:34.545 --> 09:35.984
Mr. Bass Reeves.

09:39.889 --> 09:41.648
What about him?

09:41.681 --> 09:44.208
I was going through
the rolls and, you know,

09:44.241 --> 09:45.936
thinking I would try to find someone.

09:45.969 --> 09:47.408
Scrounge someone up

09:47.441 --> 09:48.921
who might be able to assist
with the legal fees

09:48.945 --> 09:50.345
while we deal with this injunction.

09:50.897 --> 09:52.753
You are something else, you know that?

09:52.785 --> 09:54.640
You're walking pure initiative.

09:54.674 --> 09:56.337
I appreciate you something fierce.

09:57.649 --> 09:59.098
- Just doing my job.
- And in so doing,

09:59.122 --> 10:01.682
you came across the name
of one Bass Reeves.

10:02.286 --> 10:05.168
- I did.
- I know the man quite well.

10:05.201 --> 10:07.055
Okay, so who is he?

10:07.284 --> 10:10.190
I mean, he's given us so much money,

10:10.191 --> 10:12.653
but every number is out of service.

10:12.687 --> 10:14.606
Every email bounces back.

10:14.639 --> 10:17.134
- Every street address is...
- The Waffle House.

10:17.167 --> 10:18.478
So you do know the man.

10:20.751 --> 10:22.894
Who is he?

10:22.927 --> 10:24.973
I guess we got time.

10:25.007 --> 10:26.990
Have a seat.

10:27.023 --> 10:28.398
Why?

10:28.431 --> 10:30.574
Go on, just have a seat. Have a seat.

10:32.367 --> 10:36.014
Now I'm going to tell you...

10:37.358 --> 10:40.206
a story about the jack of hearts.

10:40.238 --> 10:43.278
And the two ladies in his life
that kept him on the run.

10:49.903 --> 10:51.694
Keep an eye on your boy.

11:07.214 --> 11:09.230
So, where's the jack?

11:09.263 --> 11:10.542
There.

11:12.078 --> 11:13.806
No.

11:14.863 --> 11:16.782
And he's not here either.

11:16.814 --> 11:19.662
So that means he's got to be...

11:20.783 --> 11:22.190
there.

11:22.222 --> 11:24.174
And that's the end of that story.

11:24.206 --> 11:26.198
All right, but what's that story
got to do with Bass Reeves,

11:26.222 --> 11:27.470
the mystery man?

11:29.749 --> 11:31.309
Yeah, if you could send her
an admission packet,

11:31.333 --> 11:32.333
that'd be great.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.496
Yeah, I am an alum.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.150
Class of 1998.

11:38.121 --> 11:40.072
That's... That's great.
Thank you very much.

11:40.079 --> 11:41.422
Thank you. Bye-bye.

11:41.454 --> 11:44.270
- Hey.
- Hey. Northwestern?

11:44.303 --> 11:46.499
Yeah. I'm trying to get Sophia
to cast a wider net

11:46.532 --> 11:47.979
in her college search.

11:48.012 --> 11:50.126
So we'll see.

11:52.783 --> 11:54.177
I'm in trouble.

11:55.087 --> 11:57.129
Well, not full-on trouble.

11:58.275 --> 12:00.643
Eugenia Davis just called

12:00.783 --> 12:03.214
and she told me
what transpired last week

12:03.247 --> 12:06.478
before Simone called off the wedding.

12:06.511 --> 12:09.520
What did you do
with that couple you counseled?

12:10.304 --> 12:13.453
Did Tasha go crying to Kerissa?
Is that what gave rise to all this?

12:13.454 --> 12:14.573
Sure.

12:14.606 --> 12:16.429
Yeah, I had a feeling.

12:16.463 --> 12:18.509
It's all good.

12:19.726 --> 12:21.243
Well...

12:22.542 --> 12:25.133
after Daddy died, I had to help
Mama make ends meet.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.518
And I ain't much one
to work the register

12:26.542 --> 12:28.269
at the Waffle House like she did.

12:28.302 --> 12:29.805
Although I understand now

12:29.838 --> 12:31.918
they got a pretty respectable
stock program.

12:31.950 --> 12:34.733
I went down to Beale Street,

12:34.766 --> 12:36.622
and I seen this cat
working "Find the Lady."

12:36.654 --> 12:38.509
And I watched him and watched him

12:38.543 --> 12:40.237
until one night,

12:40.270 --> 12:41.814
I went out and stole my own apple crate

12:41.838 --> 12:43.534
and went into business for myself.

12:43.566 --> 12:45.421
Put my own twist on it, of course.

12:45.455 --> 12:46.893
You ever play poker?

12:46.927 --> 12:49.165
Now you're talking my game now.

12:49.199 --> 12:50.797
I'm a shark at that table.

12:50.830 --> 12:52.366
I had a feeling.

12:52.974 --> 12:54.702
Pick out your card, see what you got.

12:57.550 --> 12:59.502
How many do you want?

12:59.534 --> 13:00.909
I'll sit.

13:00.942 --> 13:02.477
You want to put some money on?

13:02.510 --> 13:04.525
You must be sitting on something
real nice there.

13:04.559 --> 13:06.620
- Twenty bucks.
- Call.

13:07.726 --> 13:09.206
You're not going to look at your cards?

13:09.230 --> 13:10.477
Don't have to.

13:10.510 --> 13:12.077
Show me what you got, Jaws.

13:14.699 --> 13:17.546
Tens, kings, ace high.

13:24.334 --> 13:25.869
The royal family.

13:33.326 --> 13:34.541
Bass Reeves is you.

13:34.575 --> 13:36.238
A part of me, yes.

13:37.486 --> 13:39.022
And all this money he's giving us?

13:39.054 --> 13:40.557
Is money I win in a floating game

13:40.590 --> 13:42.733
and hand right back, without fail,

13:42.766 --> 13:44.685
to the Lord for his purpose.

13:44.718 --> 13:46.605
Money you win by cheating.

13:46.638 --> 13:48.462
No. I don't pull this
fancy stuff when I play.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.317
That's a quick way to get you killed.

13:50.350 --> 13:52.333
Come on. Let's go.

13:52.366 --> 13:54.093
Where are we going?

13:55.406 --> 13:57.037
To the Men's Prayer Lunch.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.957
I almost forgot about that.

13:58.990 --> 14:01.293
You didn't "almost," man. You forgot.

14:01.326 --> 14:04.653
I just wish once somebody
would call me and say,

14:04.687 --> 14:08.493
"That daughter of yours
is such a beacon of faith.

14:08.527 --> 14:11.021
What a pleasure it is to have her back."

14:13.038 --> 14:14.573
You and me both, Daddy.

14:14.606 --> 14:16.301
It's not where I'm at.

14:17.932 --> 14:19.723
I'm sorry.

14:19.982 --> 14:21.133
I'm trying.

14:23.342 --> 14:25.357
As long as you know there's a problem,

14:25.750 --> 14:27.213
there's hope.

14:28.846 --> 14:31.021
I'll handle Simone and Preston.

14:31.054 --> 14:32.526
Hey, Daddy?

14:32.558 --> 14:33.677
Yes?

14:35.022 --> 14:36.941
I was thinking about bringing a guest

14:36.975 --> 14:39.469
to Sophia's birthday party
tomorrow night.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.149
Your mother and I were wondering

14:43.182 --> 14:45.101
when you'd start seeing someone again.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.541
Who is he?

14:46.575 --> 14:48.132
Darius Nash.

14:49.315 --> 14:50.829
That muckraker?

14:50.862 --> 14:52.557
The journalist.

14:54.062 --> 14:55.853
I'll get back to you.

14:59.630 --> 15:02.542
What even is that stuff?

15:02.574 --> 15:05.069
It's green juice. Isaiah makes it.

15:05.102 --> 15:07.342
He says it's good for, like,
health stuff.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.133
Hey, you want to come over today

15:09.166 --> 15:10.774
and help me make
a playlist for the party?

15:10.798 --> 15:13.773
I can't.

15:13.806 --> 15:15.565
Isaiah has band practice.

15:15.598 --> 15:17.038
And you have to stand at attention

15:17.070 --> 15:18.797
and adore him while he plays?

15:18.830 --> 15:21.261
He has a hard time managing
the band if I'm not there.

15:21.294 --> 15:23.213
He's too nice.

15:23.246 --> 15:25.453
But when I'm there, he takes charge.

15:25.486 --> 15:27.277
We'll be at the party.

15:27.310 --> 15:29.101
He's coming with you?

15:29.134 --> 15:31.437
Yeah, I had to go to the warden,

15:31.470 --> 15:32.982
get permission for the conjugal visit.

15:33.006 --> 15:34.189
You know, the whole nine.

15:35.374 --> 15:37.837
No. Got to fix my heart rate.

15:37.870 --> 15:41.389
Anything under 120, it's like
you're watching TV. Come on.

15:43.823 --> 15:46.253
That was a solid message.

15:46.286 --> 15:48.374
Once we get that church of yours
up and running, Pastor,

15:48.398 --> 15:51.085
you're going to enter a whole
new chapter of greatness.

15:51.627 --> 15:54.349
Whoa! Speak of the devil.

15:54.383 --> 15:56.013
What's up?

15:56.140 --> 15:57.494
That floating poker game
I told you about

15:57.518 --> 15:58.925
just floated back into view.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.133
Hey, any chance you want to join?

16:01.166 --> 16:02.957
- When?
- Tomorrow night.

16:02.990 --> 16:04.685
I'll bank you.

16:04.718 --> 16:06.893
You know what? I got a family
thing tomorrow night.

16:08.964 --> 16:10.541
Would have been fun.

16:11.275 --> 16:13.550
I mean,

16:13.583 --> 16:15.406
now if it's a work thing...

16:15.431 --> 16:16.848
Well, you'll be spending the evening

16:16.872 --> 16:18.375
with one of our biggest donors.

16:18.407 --> 16:20.359
That sure sounds like
a work thing to me.

16:20.392 --> 16:22.246
I'll tell Kerissa.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.711
Maybe we can
have the game at your place.

16:24.744 --> 16:28.103
It seems the venue they'd been
planning on closed down.

16:28.136 --> 16:31.911
Well, I don't have to tell
Kerissa everything.

16:31.944 --> 16:34.951
Job 11 and 7. Even God keeps secrets.

16:35.763 --> 16:37.447
Nothing wrong with that.

16:41.607 --> 16:43.687
Kevin is gay.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.479
What?

16:45.512 --> 16:49.286
I was just connecting
the bishop's Ethernet cable.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.111
His connection's been real slow.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.182
I'll go now.

16:54.216 --> 16:56.231
Loose lips sink ships.

16:56.263 --> 16:57.574
Understood.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.791
Where did you hear this?

17:02.823 --> 17:04.519
Charity.

17:04.551 --> 17:08.582
Of course, she couched it
in all kinds of equivocations.

17:08.616 --> 17:12.156
"Kevin's having issues. He's got urges."

17:12.968 --> 17:17.095
But he has been going
to Fortitude for Families,

17:17.127 --> 17:19.623
and men don't go there
because they love women.

17:19.655 --> 17:21.542
So this is why they're breaking up.

17:21.575 --> 17:23.207
And why I want him out.

17:23.239 --> 17:24.679
Out of what?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.598
Our house. Our church.

17:26.631 --> 17:28.358
All of it.

17:28.391 --> 17:31.687
Our daughter is suffering
this indignity every day.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.542
At home, at work.

17:33.576 --> 17:35.431
- I won't have it.
- Mae.

17:35.463 --> 17:38.183
He's Nathan's father.

17:38.216 --> 17:39.952
I don't want to set us up
for some sort of class action.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.215
And why are you being so sanguine?

17:42.248 --> 17:43.879
I'm not being sanguine at all.

17:43.911 --> 17:45.991
I just got my own issues right now.

17:47.176 --> 17:48.679
What now?

17:54.504 --> 17:56.103
- Gigi.
- Daddy.

17:56.573 --> 17:58.310
Look, your mother says no.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.039
"Never."

18:00.071 --> 18:02.471
And, "Why? Sweet Jesus, why?"

18:03.815 --> 18:05.159
So, no.

18:05.192 --> 18:06.919
Well, thanks for trying.

18:06.951 --> 18:08.006
I didn't try.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.287
Thanks for telling me that.

18:09.319 --> 18:10.640
Do you honestly think that this man

18:10.664 --> 18:12.806
is part of God's plan for your life?

18:12.840 --> 18:14.982
Or do you just like
that it vexes your mother

18:15.016 --> 18:16.390
and insults me?

18:16.424 --> 18:18.519
Of course I don't like that part.

18:19.527 --> 18:21.446
It just doesn't seem optimal

18:21.480 --> 18:23.206
that a birthday party for Sophia be used

18:23.240 --> 18:25.286
as a coming-out party.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.086
For anyone.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.319
I get it, Daddy.

18:29.352 --> 18:30.855
Good. Good.

18:41.299 --> 18:43.805
Can you grandmasters set the table?

18:43.839 --> 18:45.021
All right.

18:46.622 --> 18:48.734
All right, come on, Maurice Ashley.

18:48.766 --> 18:50.493
Let's wash your hands.

18:53.183 --> 18:54.301
Good job, buddy.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.189
How's that going?

18:56.222 --> 18:58.334
My goodness. Are you serious?

18:58.366 --> 19:00.893
He's got me running
for my life over there.

19:01.982 --> 19:03.773
I mean, he's scary good.

19:03.806 --> 19:06.717
My God. Well, you know,
I was the all-state champ

19:06.750 --> 19:08.637
two years in a row,
so I'm not surprised.

19:08.670 --> 19:09.981
I know.

19:10.014 --> 19:12.413
Ris, about tomorrow night...

19:14.782 --> 19:16.381
- What?
- You and your daughter.

19:16.414 --> 19:18.013
I don't know who learned it from who,

19:18.046 --> 19:19.389
but wow.

19:19.422 --> 19:21.245
No, go ahead.

19:21.606 --> 19:22.973
I got a work thing then.

19:23.006 --> 19:24.445
Isn't that convenient.

19:26.414 --> 19:27.709
I won't do it

19:27.742 --> 19:29.213
if you tell me not to do it.

19:29.246 --> 19:30.653
No way.

19:33.790 --> 19:35.549
Live with yourself.

19:37.534 --> 19:40.285
I mean, if you're going
to be mad now. I mean...

19:40.318 --> 19:43.133
I'm not mad. I'm jealous.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.925
Some people get the grain,

19:44.958 --> 19:47.837
and some get what's left
on the threshing room floor.

19:47.870 --> 19:51.517
So you just do what you need to do.

19:53.822 --> 19:55.037
We're all good.

20:00.606 --> 20:01.885
Kevin.

20:01.918 --> 20:03.773
Linger for a moment if you would.

20:03.806 --> 20:06.077
I need to bend your ear.

20:07.102 --> 20:08.125
What's up, Ma?

20:09.075 --> 20:10.397
Ooh.

20:10.430 --> 20:12.029
It looks great in here.

20:12.062 --> 20:14.205
Well, thank you. I do my best, Kevin.

20:18.974 --> 20:20.829
So, what's up, Ma?

20:21.475 --> 20:25.565
As a confidante to so many women
through the years,

20:25.598 --> 20:29.085
parishioners who have
gone through divorce,

20:29.118 --> 20:33.117
I've seen every permutation
of what goes wrong

20:33.859 --> 20:35.475
with negotiations.

20:36.062 --> 20:37.565
Yeah?

20:37.598 --> 20:38.886
And I just wanted to let you know,

20:38.910 --> 20:41.629
quite often events take a turn,

20:41.662 --> 20:45.277
and reconciliation becomes a possibility

20:45.310 --> 20:46.877
when you least expect it.

20:46.910 --> 20:52.221
But only if both parties
keep a close watch

20:52.254 --> 20:55.005
on what they have to lose
in the process.

20:56.318 --> 20:59.069
It's one of those rare instances

20:59.102 --> 21:02.781
where self-interest
can inspire generosity.

21:04.862 --> 21:06.461
I'll keep that in mind.

21:08.574 --> 21:10.310
Because I'd just hate to see
this whole thing

21:10.334 --> 21:12.189
spin out of control,

21:12.222 --> 21:15.261
to the point that all the dirty
laundry's on the lawn.

21:16.092 --> 21:17.917
I'm sure you understand.

21:19.134 --> 21:20.701
Yeah.

21:20.734 --> 21:22.205
I knew you would.

21:22.238 --> 21:24.957
You see, I know you. I do.

21:32.542 --> 21:33.661
Hey, you.

21:33.694 --> 21:35.133
Hey.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.669
<i>Turns out finding fuzzy dice</i>

21:36.702 --> 21:38.214
<i>that don't smell like cigarette or weed</i>

21:38.238 --> 21:40.093
<i>is a lot harder than you'd think.</i>

21:40.125 --> 21:41.341
So...

21:41.374 --> 21:43.965
I got her a car emergency kit.

21:43.998 --> 21:45.725
<i>Aww, Darius.</i>

21:45.758 --> 21:47.005
<i>You already got her one?</i>

21:47.038 --> 21:49.213
No, I just...

21:50.558 --> 21:51.709
That's very sweet.

21:52.190 --> 21:53.597
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:54.936 --> 21:56.605
Everything okay?

21:56.638 --> 21:58.781
Not exactly.

21:58.814 --> 22:00.284
<i>They don't want me to come.</i>

22:00.318 --> 22:02.301
Yeah. I'm sorry.

22:02.334 --> 22:03.869
I knew it wouldn't be simple.

22:03.902 --> 22:05.277
Can we get dinner on Sunday?

22:05.648 --> 22:06.710
I'll buy.

22:08.894 --> 22:10.109
<i>Hello?</i>

22:13.246 --> 22:14.973
Maybe we should just be friends.

22:15.903 --> 22:17.533
Friends?

22:17.565 --> 22:20.541
<i>I mean, I've always said
a relationship starts,</i>

22:20.574 --> 22:22.301
<i>that's the way it's always going to be.</i>

22:22.334 --> 22:24.541
You know, and I'm not saying that...

22:26.334 --> 22:28.573
we were wrong for trying to beat that.

22:28.606 --> 22:31.165
But let's just be friends.

22:31.198 --> 22:33.853
You mean like friends that don't
see each other very often?

22:34.222 --> 22:35.804
<i>Whatever. Maybe.</i>

22:35.838 --> 22:37.693
<i>Whatever works.</i>

22:37.725 --> 22:41.145
<i>Look, you're a pastor, Grace,</i>

22:41.194 --> 22:43.549
and I'm never going back to church.

22:43.582 --> 22:46.461
So this was probably always just...

22:46.494 --> 22:47.494
A mistake?

22:48.350 --> 22:50.877
<i>No. I didn't say that.</i>

22:50.910 --> 22:53.934
Look, I'll call you in a couple of days.

22:55.294 --> 22:58.301
<i>Still got to find
this emergency kit a home.</i>

22:58.334 --> 22:59.773
Okay.

23:03.038 --> 23:04.254
Bye.

23:07.389 --> 23:09.309
Can you summarize this for us?

23:09.342 --> 23:11.037
I'll be honest.

23:11.070 --> 23:14.077
I didn't come here today
expecting this many changes.

23:14.471 --> 23:18.397
Well, your client gets 30%
of the marriage trust,

23:18.430 --> 23:21.981
flexible visitation
to be negotiated in good faith,

23:22.014 --> 23:24.093
$1,100 per month for child support,

23:24.126 --> 23:27.005
and should your client ever
be terminated by the church,

23:27.038 --> 23:29.564
he'd be prohibited
from taking any legal action.

23:29.598 --> 23:31.453
- Period.
- What?

23:31.485 --> 23:33.341
Let me see that.

23:34.654 --> 23:36.413
Kevin, I didn't know about this.

23:36.446 --> 23:38.013
Why wouldn't you tell me about that?

23:38.046 --> 23:39.238
Let's just sign this and be done.

23:39.262 --> 23:41.021
I'm not going to let you
sign this thing.

23:41.054 --> 23:42.941
I don't remember
asking you for permission.

23:44.206 --> 23:46.525
You'll have to sign
a malpractice waiver for me

23:46.558 --> 23:47.558
before you sign.

23:48.222 --> 23:49.597
That's fine.

23:57.565 --> 23:58.598
Kevin.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.349
Kevin.

24:01.607 --> 24:02.982
Kevin, wait.

24:03.230 --> 24:04.478
You told her?

24:05.769 --> 24:07.037
I'm sorry.

24:11.678 --> 24:13.341
You win.

24:14.589 --> 24:16.156
- Hey, brother.
- Watch out, man.

24:22.437 --> 24:24.430
Zora, hurry up. Let's go.

24:25.344 --> 24:27.150
Honey, have you seen my phone?

24:27.151 --> 24:29.838
Yeah, right here.

24:29.872 --> 24:31.726
You're being awfully helpful tonight.

24:31.759 --> 24:33.486
I just feel bad I'm not coming.

24:33.519 --> 24:35.758
If having dinner with this donor

24:35.791 --> 24:37.431
helps us get out of this
house, I'm all for it.

24:37.455 --> 24:39.779
- Zora!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

24:39.813 --> 24:41.892
- Where is this dinner?
- Sorry.

24:41.925 --> 24:44.004
How late do you think
you're going to be?

24:44.037 --> 24:46.852
Bye, sweetie. All right, have fun.

24:46.885 --> 24:48.516
Probably not too late.

24:48.549 --> 24:49.549
Okay.

24:52.869 --> 24:54.339
Go, go, go, go, go.

24:54.373 --> 24:57.156
All right, see you later.
Give everybody my love.

25:03.525 --> 25:05.028
<i>Brother Greenleaf.</i>

25:05.061 --> 25:07.268
<i>- She just left.
- We're on the move.</i>

25:14.821 --> 25:16.548
That's a good color for you.

25:21.285 --> 25:23.876
You know what, Charity?

25:23.909 --> 25:25.485
Don't act like everything's
cool between us.

25:25.509 --> 25:27.716
You told your mother I'm gay,

25:27.749 --> 25:28.972
which means it's only a matter of time

25:28.996 --> 25:30.724
before everybody thinks that it's true.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.564
Just stay out of my business.

25:49.989 --> 25:51.812
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

25:51.844 --> 25:53.732
This is Roberto.

25:53.764 --> 25:55.012
It's so nice to meet you.

25:55.045 --> 25:56.708
It's nice to meet you too, Pastor.

25:56.740 --> 25:58.436
So you live out this way, or...?

25:58.469 --> 26:00.452
No, we're in midtown. By Rhodes.

26:00.484 --> 26:01.828
- Rhodes College.
- Yes, ma'am.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.236
Yeah, I've heard of it.

26:03.269 --> 26:05.284
Yeah, my mom's dean of academic affairs.

26:05.317 --> 26:08.693
Okay. It's all making sense now.

26:09.720 --> 26:12.132
- It's an amazing school, Mom.
- I know. You told me.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.477
Well, Dad wants me to go
somewhere in Phoenix.

26:14.501 --> 26:16.360
Would that be better?

26:16.457 --> 26:17.960
You can have the application fee.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.624
You can apply to Rhodes.

26:19.657 --> 26:21.672
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26:21.704 --> 26:23.176
Come on, let's go mingle.

26:23.209 --> 26:24.680
- Ma'am.
- Nice to meet you.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.152
Likewise.

26:28.553 --> 26:30.312
Somebody's got a boyfriend.

26:30.344 --> 26:31.784
I know it.

26:32.777 --> 26:33.896
I cannot believe it.

26:33.928 --> 26:35.176
My God.

26:35.209 --> 26:36.872
How are you doing?

26:36.905 --> 26:38.760
With what?

26:38.793 --> 26:42.215
You know, you and Kevin and everything.

26:42.249 --> 26:44.424
It's for the best.

26:53.769 --> 26:55.080
Thank you.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.712
Look at him! Come here.

26:58.121 --> 26:59.592
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.983
Well, our son couldn't be bothered?

27:03.017 --> 27:04.584
He had a work thing.

27:04.617 --> 27:06.856
A work thing? Really?

27:06.889 --> 27:08.720
It's Isaiah. I'm going
to go outside and get him.

27:08.744 --> 27:10.536
Well, considering Jacob
doesn't have a church

27:10.569 --> 27:12.296
and his senior pastor's a fraud,

27:12.328 --> 27:14.321
I find it hard to imagine
what a work thing would be.

27:14.345 --> 27:16.167
Come on, come on, come on.

27:17.481 --> 27:19.944
But the devil finds work for idle hands.

27:19.977 --> 27:22.632
Come on, let's put that down,
get Winkie a cupcake.

27:22.665 --> 27:23.816
And you...

27:23.848 --> 27:26.056
Work thing.

27:32.105 --> 27:33.266
Hey.

27:34.441 --> 27:35.819
Hey.

27:37.130 --> 27:38.984
Look, I'm sorry about today.

27:41.865 --> 27:43.944
Yeah, me too.

27:43.977 --> 27:46.183
Hey, hey, could you guys
do me a favor, please,

27:46.217 --> 27:47.847
and pull Sophia's car around for me?

27:47.881 --> 27:49.764
I think we're going to start
opening presents soon,

27:49.788 --> 27:52.200
and that bow is a two-man job, you know?

27:55.145 --> 27:56.360
Whatever you need.

27:56.392 --> 27:58.216
Thank you. Thanks, Kevin.

27:58.249 --> 28:00.040
Thank you.

28:00.073 --> 28:03.880
Gentlemen, the bet is 10,000.

28:03.913 --> 28:05.896
I'm tempted, but...

28:07.593 --> 28:09.032
I'm done.

28:09.065 --> 28:10.152
Fold.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.664
Ten...

28:14.697 --> 28:16.360
raise 10.

28:16.393 --> 28:19.144
- After that flop?
- There it is.

28:19.176 --> 28:20.584
All right, then.

28:20.617 --> 28:21.928
What say you?

28:21.960 --> 28:22.960
Hell.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.952
I feel you, Skip.

28:34.857 --> 28:37.480
You can't be serious.

28:37.513 --> 28:40.776
- Lookee here, lookee here.
- All in.

28:40.808 --> 28:42.792
I'll see you. I'll see you.

28:42.824 --> 28:44.647
Let me see them.

28:47.433 --> 28:49.928
Ace-high flush.

28:49.961 --> 28:51.080
Posterized.

28:54.281 --> 28:55.720
You all see that, don't you?

29:02.536 --> 29:04.295
Slow down. Slow.

29:04.329 --> 29:05.415
Slow.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.384
Kings over queens.

29:13.417 --> 29:16.423
That's what I call a holy silence.

29:16.457 --> 29:19.047
Yes, indeed. Like the burning bush.

29:19.081 --> 29:21.096
Roaring fire.

29:21.128 --> 29:22.632
Quiet as the grave.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.424
That's insane, man. I've never...

29:28.456 --> 29:30.344
- Good game, fellas.
- I've never seen...

29:33.704 --> 29:35.464
Gonna be a long ride home.

29:35.497 --> 29:37.320
Enjoyed you, brother. Enjoyed you.

29:38.537 --> 29:40.167
Don't ever doubt me, Jacob.

29:57.608 --> 29:59.695
My parents gave me a pickup.

30:01.005 --> 30:02.481
Dodge Ram 4x4,

30:02.513 --> 30:04.368
fire-engine red with a lift kit.

30:04.402 --> 30:05.809
How about you?

30:06.468 --> 30:09.168
Bought myself a used Corolla for 750.

30:10.673 --> 30:12.972
It drove like crap,
but it got me around.

30:19.837 --> 30:21.040
Nice.

30:21.074 --> 30:22.192
Not bad.

30:22.225 --> 30:23.793
Last but not least...

30:26.513 --> 30:28.112
From grandma and grandpa.

30:28.146 --> 30:30.800
I wonder what this can be?

30:32.049 --> 30:33.809
Okay.

30:35.761 --> 30:38.705
It has a literal translation
from the Hebrew and the Greek.

30:38.737 --> 30:40.912
If you ever need that sort of thing.

30:40.945 --> 30:43.728
I will. Thank you so much.

30:43.762 --> 30:45.073
You're welcome, dear.

30:45.105 --> 30:46.256
Use it well.

30:48.024 --> 30:49.143
Are we done now?

30:49.176 --> 30:50.455
Not quite.

30:57.655 --> 30:59.095
What's in here?

30:59.128 --> 31:00.535
Take a look, sweetheart.

31:00.567 --> 31:01.782
I love tiny boxes.

31:07.224 --> 31:08.471
No way.

31:08.503 --> 31:10.582
Well...

31:10.616 --> 31:14.743
That deserves an applause.

31:25.976 --> 31:27.575
Hey, Kevin.

31:27.607 --> 31:28.918
What's up?

31:29.514 --> 31:30.559
You know, once the smoke clears

31:30.583 --> 31:33.366
and all this legal stuff is behind you,

31:34.774 --> 31:36.576
if you ever need someone to talk to...

31:36.775 --> 31:38.726
about whatever...

31:41.773 --> 31:43.052
Thanks.

31:43.192 --> 31:44.951
No, you didn't!

31:47.063 --> 31:49.463
- Are you serious?
- Would you look?

31:49.495 --> 31:51.158
This is too much.

31:51.192 --> 31:52.791
That is...

31:52.823 --> 31:55.190
- You like it?
- Yes. Thank you, thank you.

31:55.224 --> 31:56.471
My God.

31:59.073 --> 32:01.782
We should, take it for a spin.

32:01.815 --> 32:03.285
Can we, Mom? Please?

32:03.319 --> 32:04.662
Come on, it's Sophia's birthday.

32:04.695 --> 32:06.069
- Please?
- Works for me.

32:06.103 --> 32:08.310
Be home by 11:00.

32:08.342 --> 32:10.902
I'll have them both home with
time to spare, Mrs. Greenleaf.

32:10.935 --> 32:12.277
That's a promise.

32:12.311 --> 32:14.966
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Y'all be careful out there.

32:18.583 --> 32:19.702
My gosh!

32:19.735 --> 32:21.686
Y'all in?

32:21.719 --> 32:24.374
Seat belts. Seat belts, everybody.

32:25.718 --> 32:27.103
You look so good in this car.
You like it?

32:27.127 --> 32:28.374
- Yes, I do.
- I love you.

32:28.406 --> 32:30.575
- Thank you, Mom. Mwah.
- You're welcome.

32:30.630 --> 32:32.422
Have fun.

32:32.474 --> 32:34.362
Not too much fun.

32:34.501 --> 32:37.220
Okay. Here we go.

32:38.806 --> 32:41.366
Birthday girl!

32:43.447 --> 32:45.718
That's so good.

32:47.379 --> 32:51.115
So, we wait till Sunday
to stick this in some envelopes

32:51.130 --> 32:52.269
with made-up names,

32:52.270 --> 32:54.637
Now, I chose Bass Reeves
because he was the real Django

32:54.670 --> 32:56.045
back in the day.

32:56.078 --> 32:57.965
- Black U.S. Marshal.
- Is that right?

32:57.998 --> 33:00.333
- He was a real dude?
- Yeah, he's a real dude now.

33:00.366 --> 33:01.997
You can make up a name for yourself.

33:02.030 --> 33:04.045
And if you want my advice,
pick a good one.

33:04.724 --> 33:07.597
It'll make everything
feel more... legal.

33:07.630 --> 33:09.005
Drop it in the plate.

33:09.038 --> 33:10.669
Well, speaking of legal...

33:10.702 --> 33:12.621
Yes, sir. I'd better get
my ass out of here

33:12.654 --> 33:14.253
before Kerissa drives up, right?

33:14.286 --> 33:15.483
What about the law?

33:15.997 --> 33:18.387
Or even God's law?

33:18.419 --> 33:20.274
You're okay with this?

33:20.308 --> 33:21.587
I love you asked that.

33:21.620 --> 33:23.410
If you didn't, I'd have my doubts.

33:23.444 --> 33:26.994
Here's my gloss on the matter,
and of course you have your own.

33:27.931 --> 33:30.963
The spiritual danger, when it
comes to gambling, is twofold.

33:30.995 --> 33:32.658
If you do it for the love of money,

33:32.692 --> 33:34.642
and if you do it depending on luck.

33:34.675 --> 33:37.395
That is to say, depending
on something other than God.

33:37.428 --> 33:39.859
Now, I'm giving all this
back to the church,

33:39.891 --> 33:42.258
so it's not for the love of money.

33:42.292 --> 33:45.075
And I can count
on only the Lord to keep me ahead,

33:45.107 --> 33:46.906
so there's no intervening power

33:46.940 --> 33:49.149
upon which I am calling or depending on.

33:49.182 --> 33:51.806
So I'm at a loss to see what's wrong.

33:53.728 --> 33:58.494
And you're really okay
with giving all that...

33:58.585 --> 34:00.663
to the church?

34:00.697 --> 34:01.943
Why not?

34:02.414 --> 34:04.088
It's all God's money.

34:07.929 --> 34:10.679
Maricel, let's keep all the peonies

34:10.712 --> 34:12.920
and send the rest
to Lamplighters in the morning.

34:12.952 --> 34:15.286
And let's get all the gifts upstairs

34:15.320 --> 34:16.920
for when Sophia comes home.

34:16.952 --> 34:18.518
She'd love to find them there.

34:18.552 --> 34:20.726
Yes, ma'am.

34:20.761 --> 34:22.647
My God.

34:22.681 --> 34:24.184
There you are.

34:24.216 --> 34:26.424
I have to tell you that I felt like

34:26.456 --> 34:28.471
I was in the Twilight Zone tonight,

34:28.504 --> 34:30.007
remembering all the parties

34:30.040 --> 34:32.311
that I threw for you, Grace and Faith.

34:32.344 --> 34:34.577
It was a beautiful night, Mama.

34:34.681 --> 34:36.568
No. What's the matter now?

34:37.318 --> 34:38.820
Because it wouldn't be a night

34:38.853 --> 34:41.029
if someone wasn't after me
for something.

34:43.251 --> 34:45.010
I won't let you fire Kevin.

34:45.042 --> 34:47.056
Well, I have no immediate plans to.

34:47.091 --> 34:48.914
You had Aaron put that clause in.

34:48.947 --> 34:50.907
Because I wanted to be sure
that we were protected

34:50.931 --> 34:53.650
if this war between
the two of you were to escalate.

34:53.681 --> 34:54.610
Mama!

34:54.641 --> 34:56.146
I mean it.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.833
I see you're sincere, dear.

34:58.867 --> 35:00.786
I still feel bad about Carlton,

35:00.819 --> 35:02.770
and how all of that went down.

35:02.803 --> 35:06.194
I won't let you do that
to the father of my child.

35:06.227 --> 35:09.234
Well, let's pray we don't have to.

35:09.267 --> 35:11.890
I know you feel bad about
what you were sharing with me,

35:11.922 --> 35:14.097
but if you saw it from my vantage point,

35:14.131 --> 35:15.857
I know you'd have done the same.

35:15.891 --> 35:17.522
Family comes first.

35:17.555 --> 35:21.394
And I'll take this sad one.
It certainly is a runt.

35:21.426 --> 35:23.314
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah.

35:26.930 --> 35:30.130
Family comes first. It has to.

35:38.898 --> 35:40.881
Winkie wants his good-night kiss.

35:40.915 --> 35:42.706
All right, I'll be right there.

35:42.738 --> 35:43.953
What are you looking at?

35:47.315 --> 35:48.626
Bass Reeves.

35:48.658 --> 35:49.746
Who's that?

35:50.052 --> 35:51.715
Some black gunslinger.

35:52.326 --> 35:54.257
And why are you reading about him?

35:55.315 --> 35:56.530
No reason.

35:58.973 --> 36:00.177
How was the party?

36:00.211 --> 36:02.226
Your mother was rude,
your father was pouty,

36:02.258 --> 36:05.202
and the house was not this.

36:06.260 --> 36:08.079
Well, we'll be out of here soon enough.

36:08.104 --> 36:09.255
That's the plan.

36:42.978 --> 36:45.306
I haven't bowled
since I was a kid.

36:46.722 --> 36:48.833
Let's go to The Row.

36:49.811 --> 36:52.371
We said we were going here.

36:52.404 --> 36:54.323
We had to tell them
we were going somewhere.

36:54.355 --> 36:57.074
That doesn't mean
we have to go. We're free.

36:57.108 --> 36:58.227
But...

36:58.260 --> 36:59.635
Just come.

36:59.667 --> 37:00.947
It'll be more fun than this.

37:00.979 --> 37:02.067
Bowling?

37:02.100 --> 37:04.050
I don't want to go to The Row.

37:04.084 --> 37:06.163
Come on. It'll be fun.

37:06.196 --> 37:08.179
Isaiah's friend works there.

37:08.212 --> 37:10.169
There'll be beer.

37:10.256 --> 37:13.328
I can get you a birthday beer.

37:13.895 --> 37:15.184
No.

37:15.611 --> 37:17.178
Then is it okay if I go?

37:17.211 --> 37:18.522
No, it's not okay.

37:18.555 --> 37:20.282
This is my birthday.

37:20.315 --> 37:21.946
You're busy every other day with him.

37:21.979 --> 37:24.026
Can't you just stick with me
for this one night?

37:24.059 --> 37:26.330
- I'm not always with him.
- Yes, you are.

37:26.363 --> 37:28.954
I can't even have a conversation
with you for five minutes

37:28.987 --> 37:32.410
without you texting him,
talking about him, running off.

37:34.561 --> 37:36.000
You need his permission?

37:36.033 --> 37:39.030
I would never do to you

37:39.063 --> 37:40.986
what you're doing to me right now.

37:42.014 --> 37:43.166
It's not cool.

37:43.198 --> 37:44.317
Come on.

37:57.670 --> 37:59.524
Hello.

38:00.429 --> 38:03.973
Just putting a little
inscription in Sophia's Bible.

38:04.812 --> 38:06.085
I see that.

38:06.484 --> 38:07.845
What are you saying?

38:07.878 --> 38:12.388
Just my own little gloss
on Deuteronomy 32 and 2.

38:14.677 --> 38:17.482
"May my teachings fall like rain.

38:17.895 --> 38:20.528
"May my words descend like dew.

38:21.043 --> 38:23.930
"Like showers on the green leaves.

38:24.559 --> 38:26.415
With love, from us to you."

38:27.439 --> 38:28.879
Daddy.

38:28.912 --> 38:31.087
You gave her a study Bible.

38:31.962 --> 38:34.127
I gave one to you too, didn't I?

38:34.159 --> 38:37.240
But not Charity, not Faith.

38:40.350 --> 38:41.692
And your point is?

38:44.122 --> 38:47.129
I don't want Sophia to follow
in my footsteps, Daddy.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.810
Especially when they've led me
to such a...

38:51.435 --> 38:53.386
confusing place.

38:54.608 --> 38:57.391
Sophia came to me
the day before yesterday

38:57.424 --> 39:00.657
and expressed an interest
in teaching the Little Saints.

39:01.244 --> 39:02.895
That's why I gave it to her.

39:03.444 --> 39:05.107
She didn't tell me that.

39:05.140 --> 39:07.411
Probably because she
was so scared you'd direct her

39:07.444 --> 39:08.817
away from doing it.

39:09.297 --> 39:10.960
What a fearful place it must be

39:10.994 --> 39:14.481
to finally find yourself
bathing in the glow

39:14.513 --> 39:16.195
of a brand-new faith,

39:17.244 --> 39:20.529
and think your own mother
would treat it like a sickness

39:20.561 --> 39:22.257
or a stupid mistake.

39:22.289 --> 39:24.337
- I wouldn't do that.
- She doesn't know that.

39:24.369 --> 39:26.320
I don't know that.

39:26.354 --> 39:29.137
And my guess is, you probably
don't know it either.

39:31.793 --> 39:33.904
What is it going to take, Gigi,

39:34.740 --> 39:36.915
to bring you back into the fold?

39:40.316 --> 39:42.115
Put Mac in jail.

39:46.920 --> 39:48.712
Gigi.

39:50.729 --> 39:51.729
Yeah, Daddy?

39:53.470 --> 39:55.998
Vengeance is mine.

39:56.264 --> 40:01.415
Anybody tries to take the wheel
of this world from God...

40:05.160 --> 40:10.696
is going to find themselves
in a ditch real quick.

40:39.066 --> 40:41.145
You think on these things.
