00:18.000 --> 00:20.079
<i>Long before the dawn of men...</i>

00:20.080 --> 00:22.792
<i>Strife was already a major
component of life.</i>

00:25.200 --> 00:28.199
<i>Wherever a creature shared
a piece of land with another...</i>

00:28.200 --> 00:30.200
<i>It was just a matter of time...</i>

00:30.201 --> 00:33.241
<i>until a struggle full resources
would ensue you.</i>

00:40.241 --> 00:46.120
<i>Men was no different. Showcasing a
perverse fascination with violence.</i>

00:46.121 --> 00:51.040
<i>Men and civilization brought forth more
innovative ways of taking human lives.</i>

00:51.041 --> 00:54.275
<i>Than any other function needed for
survival.</i>

00:55.162 --> 00:57.121
<i>There are more ways of killing a
man...</i>

00:57.122 --> 00:59.201
<i>Than there are ways of making
bread.</i>

00:59.202 --> 01:01.081
<i>Or making love.</i>

01:01.082 --> 01:04.081
<i>Where the latter 2 are quite
limited in scale...</i>

01:04.081 --> 01:07.041
<i>Man has gone beyond imagination...</i>

01:07.042 --> 01:09.121
<i>With his capacity to destroy life.</i>

01:09.122 --> 01:12.196
<i>With one push of a button.</i>

01:15.122 --> 01:17.401
<i>Between uncontrolled crime in the
streets...</i>

01:18.043 --> 01:20.082
<i>And escalating war in the
borders...</i>

01:20.083 --> 01:23.282
<i>It was all just a matter of time.</i>

01:26.243 --> 01:29.202
<i>From the ashes a new world was
born.</i>

01:29.242 --> 01:32.041
<i>The surviving nations finally
realised that...</i>

01:32.042 --> 01:34.201
<i>Men's unstoppable appetite for
destruction...</i>

01:34.202 --> 01:36.400
<i>Must be contained.</i>

01:38.243 --> 01:41.242
<i>A ban on all firearms was strictly
enforced.</i>

01:41.243 --> 01:44.122
<i>And just as a sword gave way to the
gun...</i>

01:44.123 --> 01:46.355
<i>The gun gave way to the sword.</i>

01:47.163 --> 01:50.122
<i>Leaving the authorities to carry
the hope of their nations...</i>

01:50.123 --> 01:52.162
<i>On a tip of a spear...</i>

01:52.163 --> 01:56.122
<i>Little did they know that the self
destructive nature of men...</i>

01:56.123 --> 01:58.082
<i>Could never be stopped.</i>

01:58.083 --> 02:00.082
<i>There's not enough love in this
world...</i>

02:00.083 --> 02:05.161
<i>Not enough money to prevent this ancient
circle from coming around again.</i>

02:06.124 --> 02:07.243
<i>When the time is ripe...</i>

02:07.244 --> 02:09.395
<i>Evil will rise.</i>

02:10.003 --> 02:11.243
<i>Personified in our case...</i>

02:11.244 --> 02:13.123
<i>With a wood cutter.</i>

02:13.124 --> 02:14.203
<i>Nicola is his name.</i>

02:14.204 --> 02:17.163
<i>And this is his town, his land.</i>

02:17.164 --> 02:20.363
<i>The God forsaken place where our
tale begins.</i>

02:21.244 --> 02:24.164
<i>And as many ways as there are of
killing a man...</i>

02:24.165 --> 02:28.400
<i>There are equally as many ways of
telling this old tale of strife.</i>

02:31.125 --> 02:33.124
Ladies and gentlemen!

02:33.125 --> 02:36.124
Welcome to our show, the town's
midnight main event.

02:36.125 --> 02:39.124
The occasional challenges are
already underway.

02:39.125 --> 02:44.406
On one side in the gray suit, red
hat, is Killer # 2.

02:45.005 --> 02:48.125
Representing the colossal
undefeated gang...

02:48.126 --> 02:51.200
Along with 20 soldiers from their
red army.

02:55.006 --> 02:59.366
On the roof, all in gray, a scout from
the proletarian league of defense...

03:00.246 --> 03:05.165
And on the far side, in menacing
militant led by Valentine...

03:05.166 --> 03:07.398
On the contenders of the hour...

03:08.206 --> 03:10.200
Behold, men...

03:10.207 --> 03:14.248
The buffoon who calls himself
Killer # 2.

03:16.047 --> 03:17.403
Are you here for the ball,
my friend?

03:18.087 --> 03:22.401
'Cos we're here to challenge Nicola's
reign in the name of the people!

04:13.168 --> 04:16.207
20 men is the unwritten law
of this land.

04:16.208 --> 04:22.088
So any gang in the province has a chance to
challenge The Woodcutter and take the town.

04:22.089 --> 04:24.048
But as the leader
of the biggest gang...

04:24.049 --> 04:26.248
and the cold often exceeds
the sporting gesture...

04:26.249 --> 04:30.199
by sending only 1 killer
to defend his crown...

05:26.091 --> 05:27.368
Stop.

05:29.172 --> 05:32.051
You can roll the dice and die with
your men or...

05:32.052 --> 05:34.171
Take the safe bat and come back to
work for Nicola.

05:34.172 --> 05:36.171
All this will be forgotten.

05:36.172 --> 05:38.091
Even the buffoon part.

05:38.092 --> 05:40.370
You want me to work for a
woodcutter?

05:41.052 --> 05:44.331
I call myself a killer win me a
number.

05:45.132 --> 05:47.131
How about...

05:47.132 --> 05:49.364
Killer # 1?

06:14.213 --> 06:16.286
What should we do with him?

06:20.253 --> 06:23.168
Kill them all.

06:29.253 --> 06:33.252
Another gang, another night,
another fight.

06:33.753 --> 06:36.452
And when will the wind
bring a real challenge?

06:36.453 --> 06:39.453
Ask the most powerful man
east of the Atlantic.

06:41.054 --> 06:44.133
Rest assured, his wish will be
granted.

06:44.134 --> 06:47.253
But although our villain is constantly
challenged in his own quarters...

06:47.254 --> 06:52.053
It is quite unlikely that his world
order will be shaken from within.

06:52.054 --> 06:54.253
For such a dramatic change to
occur"

06:54.254 --> 06:57.248
An outside intervention is needed.

06:58.014 --> 07:01.254
An intervention brought about by
some means of transportation...

07:01.255 --> 07:04.054
Many a time... a train.

07:04.055 --> 07:06.173
Much like this one.

07:14.175 --> 07:17.134
And as always the case with such
trains...

07:17.135 --> 07:20.368
There should be at least one silent
stranger aboard.

07:28.216 --> 07:30.414
Or two.

07:50.217 --> 07:52.096
But for now...

07:52.097 --> 07:53.216
Mark the red suit.

07:53.217 --> 07:57.167
Walking under the train with the
confidence of an oppressor.

07:58.257 --> 08:00.176
Mark the gray people.

08:00.177 --> 08:02.176
Cowering in their seats.

08:02.177 --> 08:06.377
Mark a lawless town silently crying
for a hero.

09:44.261 --> 09:46.379
You remind me of someone.

09:47.221 --> 09:49.140
A good man.

09:49.141 --> 09:51.419
He also had very quick hands.

09:52.181 --> 09:55.175
A friend of mine recommended that I
come here.

09:55.221 --> 09:58.181
I'm looking for a game of cards.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.372
Cards?

10:01.181 --> 10:03.334
They're not in dope city anymore.

10:09.062 --> 10:10.338
No cards here.

10:14.062 --> 10:16.294
No gambling of any kind.

10:55.063 --> 10:58.183
- You killed him.
- What was their prize on his head?

11:04.063 --> 11:07.262
- No bounties here, Mister.
- No gambling?

11:07.263 --> 11:09.336
No bounties?

11:10.224 --> 11:12.422
What's alone man to do?

11:16.264 --> 11:19.224
I'd say he's worth about a
thousand.

11:21.144 --> 11:23.223
That's a hundred each.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.342
You're out of your fucking mind!

11:27.264 --> 11:29.416
That's two thousand.

11:31.064 --> 11:32.223
That's about nine ways.

11:32.224 --> 11:34.343
That doesn't quite go in, does it?

12:01.146 --> 12:04.185
Friday nights at the Russian
roulette.

12:04.186 --> 12:08.341
But it will cost you a fortune to
play in this game.

12:09.066 --> 12:11.145
What's a fortune?

12:11.146 --> 12:14.345
That thing that awaits you at the
end of the road, son.

12:17.066 --> 12:18.422
I ain't your son.

12:30.267 --> 12:32.306
Yoshi?

12:39.187 --> 12:41.106
I brought money.

12:41.107 --> 12:44.421
They own this town.. If they want
something.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.379
They take it.

12:47.228 --> 12:49.267
Just tell me.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.307
Where can I find them?

12:57.107 --> 12:58.266
Did somebody die?

12:58.267 --> 13:01.387
Not yet. But the prospects seem
promising.

13:03.187 --> 13:07.229
Yoshi is here at your Uncle's
request.

13:08.068 --> 13:10.425
This is my father's dying wish.

13:12.068 --> 13:15.381
The 'Dragon' is just a piece of
gold.

13:17.148 --> 13:20.147
Let me take you down to the market.

13:20.148 --> 13:23.222
We can copy the medallion.

13:24.268 --> 13:27.107
Your father won't know the
difference.

13:27.108 --> 13:29.227
An honorable man...

13:30.069 --> 13:33.268
Knows the right path.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.307
Don't you think?

13:41.069 --> 13:44.068
I am not like my father.

13:44.069 --> 13:46.187
Not yet, you're not.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.188
With violence.

13:50.189 --> 13:52.069
For me...

13:52.070 --> 13:54.268
Life is about...

13:55.070 --> 13:56.381
The perfection of Jin.

13:57.030 --> 14:01.310
Then you shouldn't have come here.

14:02.190 --> 14:04.109
Enter Red Suits.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.189
Red Suits.

14:06.190 --> 14:09.264
Good evening. Can I help you?

14:15.191 --> 14:20.150
Out of the 7 codes of Bushido. Jin
is the toughest one to master.

14:20.151 --> 14:24.190
If only because a compassionate
warrior is contradictory in turns.

14:24.191 --> 14:27.110
But Yoshi, perhaps despite his
father...

14:27.111 --> 14:28.422
He's made Jin his purpose.

14:29.071 --> 14:31.190
And it's a purpose that makes
strong a vow...

14:31.191 --> 14:33.423
At least strong enough... until
now.

14:34.071 --> 14:35.427
Do they know you're here?

14:36.071 --> 14:38.350
I ordered the Japan for this month.

14:40.072 --> 14:42.429
We came... for fish.

14:47.112 --> 14:49.271
So why don't you run along to the
kitchen and I'll...

14:49.272 --> 14:51.345
Chop off some.

14:53.112 --> 14:54.151
Go on.

14:54.152 --> 14:55.428
Chop chop!

15:03.273 --> 15:06.393
Life... every man holds dear.

15:07.073 --> 15:11.386
But the dear man holds honor, far
more precious than dear life...

15:12.152 --> 15:15.431
Especially if that man happens to
be Japanese.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.272
Yoshi!

15:31.273 --> 15:33.312
This is what Jin is all about!

16:52.116 --> 16:54.190
Get out!

16:59.237 --> 17:00.434
Yoshi!

17:01.237 --> 17:03.230
Yoshi!

17:08.237 --> 17:11.196
They have an office in the meat
market.

17:11.277 --> 17:13.395
You wanna speak to Eddie.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.117
If things don't go well...

17:17.117 --> 17:19.396
There's a bar in Little West-world.

17:20.078 --> 17:22.276
You may be able to buy some
information there.

17:24.198 --> 17:27.277
Things never go well before first
going wrong.

17:27.278 --> 17:29.236
And then getting worse.

17:29.237 --> 17:32.276
Which is one of many lessons our
silent drifter's been hearing...

17:32.277 --> 17:35.192
For as long as he can remember.

17:44.078 --> 17:47.232
- So, Mister, where to?
- Russian Roulette.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.350
You're from out of town.

17:52.198 --> 17:54.350
Aren't you?

17:56.278 --> 17:59.432
Hold your head up high, keep your
eyes on the prize.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.197
Never let your guard down.

18:01.198 --> 18:03.238
The world is filled with bad
people.

18:03.239 --> 18:05.238
Hey, Mister, looking for a good
time?

18:05.239 --> 18:07.198
Always.

18:10.239 --> 18:12.118
Hey! Where do you think you're
going?

18:12.119 --> 18:13.395
I'm looking for a game of cards.

18:14.079 --> 18:15.310
Keep looking.

18:53.201 --> 18:55.080
If you play your cards right...

18:55.081 --> 18:57.200
You'll always be quicker on the
draw.

18:57.201 --> 18:58.240
Lonesome...

18:58.241 --> 19:00.200
But live nonetheless.

19:00.201 --> 19:01.398
She said every night.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.160
Before putting him to sleep.

19:03.161 --> 19:04.160
And he listened.

19:04.161 --> 19:06.313
And she sung him a lullaby.

19:22.082 --> 19:23.393
Can I help you?

19:25.242 --> 19:27.281
What's behind the door?

19:33.202 --> 19:36.122
- it'll cost you.
- How much?

19:36.123 --> 19:37.082
$50, 000.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.280
Cash?

19:39.083 --> 19:40.394
Got anything else of value?

19:41.123 --> 19:43.241
Diamonds? Drugs?

19:43.243 --> 19:45.161
Bullets?

19:45.162 --> 19:46.241
My life.

19:46.242 --> 19:48.201
Worthless.

19:48.242 --> 19:51.161
This is the headman personal game.

19:51.162 --> 19:53.081
No exception to the rule.

19:53.082 --> 19:54.393
Is he here tonight?

19:58.083 --> 19:59.280
Friday.

19:59.283 --> 20:01.242
Every Friday.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.277
He hasn't missed a game in 10
years.

20:12.243 --> 20:14.202
Vote For the General!

20:20.204 --> 20:21.435
Come on, come on, let's go.

20:23.204 --> 20:26.198
Thank you very much for your
continued support!

20:47.245 --> 20:49.284
Sign.

20:58.245 --> 21:01.124
So far, so good.

21:01.125 --> 21:04.324
It's like kind ways or right way?

21:05.125 --> 21:07.244
Or so it seems.

21:07.246 --> 21:10.165
Out east, in the forest...

21:10.166 --> 21:13.285
In between caves, cliffs and
waterfalls...

21:13.286 --> 21:17.125
The camp... the mansion...

21:17.126 --> 21:18.437
The training grounds...

21:19.046 --> 21:22.125
Red suits and killers are more
troubled to be found...

21:22.126 --> 21:24.205
From a dragon for help.

21:24.206 --> 21:26.085
We've only just begun.

21:26.086 --> 21:29.207
It's Eddie, he said it was urgent.

21:31.167 --> 21:33.399
Yeah, number 2, Eddie here, Sir.

21:34.207 --> 21:36.246
It's a beautiful day, Eddie.

21:36.247 --> 21:38.166
The birds are chirping.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.206
There's a strange man here, Sir.

21:40.207 --> 21:41.246
An oriental.

21:41.247 --> 21:44.086
The birds, Eddie, they're chirping.

21:44.087 --> 21:46.285
He says he wants to offer a trade.

21:49.247 --> 21:51.247
- A what?
- Exactly.

21:51.248 --> 21:53.287
Now, we had a little incident last
night...

21:53.288 --> 21:57.167
Some of our boys got beat up pretty
bad at a Japanese restaurant.

21:57.168 --> 21:59.127
Does he look Japanese?

21:59.128 --> 22:00.359
He looks fishy.

22:02.128 --> 22:03.206
Fishy fish...

22:03.207 --> 22:06.361
Hm-hm... Don't you think it's odd,
Sir?

22:07.047 --> 22:08.437
- Odd?
- Yeah.

22:10.247 --> 22:13.321
Singing dogs are odd, Eddie.

22:14.088 --> 22:17.401
An oriental stranger who's beating
up your men is not odd.

22:18.168 --> 22:21.288
In the worst case, he's an
intriguing problem.

22:22.088 --> 22:24.167
- Your problem.
- Yes, yes, I...

22:24.168 --> 22:26.087
Great. Now, Eddie...

22:26.088 --> 22:27.399
If you interrupt me like this
again...

22:28.048 --> 22:29.247
You will see the edge of my
dagger...

22:29.248 --> 22:31.321
Literally speaking of course...

22:34.088 --> 22:36.286
Ah, of course, Sir.

22:40.209 --> 22:41.406
Eddie.

22:42.129 --> 22:43.168
Yoshi.

22:43.169 --> 22:44.168
Yoshi...

22:44.169 --> 22:46.321
Come.. Sit here.

22:55.089 --> 22:57.208
- What's this?
- Just a precaution.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.204
We've had quite a few mercenaries
come to town lately.

23:00.210 --> 23:03.289
Every small syndicates think they
could just muscle in...

23:03.290 --> 23:05.129
And take over the land.

23:05.130 --> 23:08.129
We have to deal with 5 challenges
in the last 2 months alone...

23:08.130 --> 23:10.362
Now, even the workers are
fantasizing it.

23:12.210 --> 23:15.129
Almost like 16th century Japan
here.

23:15.130 --> 23:17.328
- Almost.
- Exactly.

23:22.250 --> 23:26.247
What's your story, Yoshi? Who sent
you?

23:27.051 --> 23:28.170
Tokyo Yakuza?

23:28.171 --> 23:29.402
I'm a villager.

23:30.091 --> 23:33.370
My family will pay a lot of
money...

23:34.051 --> 23:37.250
For a... a dragon.

23:38.211 --> 23:39.408
Here.

23:40.131 --> 23:42.204
Hey, hey, hey...

23:42.251 --> 23:46.131
Listen... I'm not looking for a
fight.

23:46.132 --> 23:50.291
Passing the journey. If any of your
men identifies it...

23:50.292 --> 23:52.410
He can make a lot of money.

24:01.292 --> 24:04.252
An interesting character, Yoshi.

24:05.132 --> 24:07.171
Next time, be a little more
careful.

24:07.172 --> 24:12.172
Run ahead. Avoid unnecessary
trouble and most importantly...

24:12.173 --> 24:15.452
Stay away from Japanese
restaurants.

25:15.134 --> 25:17.333
A villager, huh?

25:18.175 --> 25:21.454
Yoshi, Yoshi, Yoshi...

25:24.095 --> 25:25.406
You're good.

25:26.215 --> 25:28.367
But you can't beat me with a stick.

25:37.215 --> 25:43.328
I'm giving you... one... last...
chance.

25:56.256 --> 25:58.374
Red Sake.

26:00.176 --> 26:02.175
Just give me Whiskey.

26:02.176 --> 26:05.251
- What kind?
- Any kind.

26:44.137 --> 26:45.216
How much is it?

26:45.217 --> 26:46.448
Fifty-five.

26:47.137 --> 26:48.413
For a glass?

26:49.098 --> 26:50.409
You said any kind.

27:04.098 --> 27:05.374
Very much.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.098
A man needs a hobby.

27:22.099 --> 27:25.298
- Mine's pop-up funnies.
- Pop-up funny?

27:29.299 --> 27:31.292
Oh...

27:32.179 --> 27:35.179
- it's for children.
- No.

27:35.180 --> 27:38.220
It's for people with imagination.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.378
It's the myth of Arachhidiz.

27:43.100 --> 27:49.337
In his youth, Arachhidiz falls into a
hidden cave and gets beaten by an arachnid.

27:51.180 --> 27:53.412
An arachnid is... a spider.

27:54.100 --> 27:57.260
Anyhow... as he grows older...

27:57.661 --> 28:02.262
Arachhidiz realizes
the bite gave him special powers.

28:02.263 --> 28:05.063
Spiders don't have special powers.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.220
They walk on the walls.

28:08.221 --> 28:10.419
- Funny.
- No.

28:11.221 --> 28:15.180
Arachhidiz uses his newly obtained
powers...

28:15.181 --> 28:17.413
To get far stronger enemies.

28:22.262 --> 28:27.181
He realizes that his new power gives
him a responsibility to fight.

28:27.182 --> 28:29.300
For the greater good.

28:29.302 --> 28:32.296
And the weak men's freedom.

28:33.142 --> 28:38.253
So, it's a story about personal
responsibility.

28:40.222 --> 28:42.261
And then some...

28:43.143 --> 28:45.262
- Why don't you drink the drink?
- The truth is...

28:45.263 --> 28:48.303
I didn't really come here for the
whisky.

28:49.223 --> 28:51.455
I had a feeling you were gonna say
that.

28:52.263 --> 28:54.460
I'm looking for some information.

28:55.182 --> 28:56.261
About a guy.

28:56.262 --> 28:58.380
Named Nicola.

29:01.102 --> 29:02.378
Good luck, friend.

29:53.105 --> 29:54.416
Good timing.

29:55.305 --> 29:57.304
Figured it was time for a drink.

29:57.305 --> 30:00.459
Well, this one's on the house.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.184
Who are you?

30:09.185 --> 30:11.264
Either a friend or a foe.

30:11.265 --> 30:13.144
Depends on who's looking.

30:13.145 --> 30:16.345
- I'm looking.
- Maybe you should look somewhere else.

30:20.106 --> 30:22.258
Something on your mind?

30:22.306 --> 30:25.346
$48, 000 something to be exact.

30:26.146 --> 30:29.225
Well, this might be your lucky
night.

30:29.226 --> 30:33.225
'Cos this fine gentleman here is
looking to buy some information.

30:33.226 --> 30:35.378
About a fella named Nicola.

30:36.266 --> 30:39.261
You think you might be able to help
him out?

30:46.267 --> 30:48.306
So...

30:49.227 --> 30:51.226
You know this man?

30:51.227 --> 30:53.300
What if I do?

30:56.307 --> 30:58.346
I need to find him.

31:13.227 --> 31:15.226
I need a loan..

31:15.227 --> 31:18.226
Two days and I'll have it back to
you with interest.

31:18.227 --> 31:20.266
After that...

31:21.107 --> 31:23.306
I'll see what I can do.

31:24.108 --> 31:25.307
What's in it for me?

31:25.308 --> 31:27.267
Profit.

31:29.188 --> 31:32.387
And the ultimate power of my
negotiating skills.

31:37.308 --> 31:40.268
[Yoshi Speaking in Japanese]

31:44.188 --> 31:46.387
Are you gonna tell me what that means
or are you gonna leave me guessing?

31:48.109 --> 31:49.308
It means you are...

31:49.309 --> 31:51.308
A liar.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.461
And a cheat.

31:59.189 --> 32:03.310
And I don't see howl need you to
negotiate for me.

32:08.309 --> 32:11.270
You guys wanna fight... Take it
outside.

34:13.154 --> 34:17.353
The good mentor... Never forces
himself on the unprepared.

34:18.313 --> 34:20.233
Steady opens the door...

34:20.234 --> 34:24.309
And waits for the rain to push them
into his warm embrace.

36:19.238 --> 36:23.439
Bravo! Bravisimo!

37:11.201 --> 37:12.360
I'm sorry.

37:12.361 --> 37:16.436
She said she'd tell Nicola I tried
to rape her.

37:17.081 --> 37:19.160
You know me, I pay on time.

37:19.161 --> 37:20.472
Sshhhh...

37:24.321 --> 37:26.160
I found them in the back.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.280
Messing with the ladies.

37:27.281 --> 37:29.160
What did I tell you?

37:29.161 --> 37:30.281
You know how she is.

37:30.282 --> 37:34.278
Leave them alone! You degenerate
fuck!

37:35.202 --> 37:36.321
You don't run me.

37:36.322 --> 37:39.396
You don't tell me what to do.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.434
Take her to the camp.

37:53.203 --> 37:54.479
Have them wash her down.

37:56.163 --> 37:57.322
And get her ready.

37:57.323 --> 38:02.162
You're nothing, but a dog.

38:02.163 --> 38:05.282
Nicola's little poodle.

38:10.242 --> 38:12.241
Your time is coming, pooch.

38:12.242 --> 38:17.274
And I promise I'll be there when
you're finally stiff.

38:22.083 --> 38:23.280
What about them?

38:25.243 --> 38:29.318
It's not their fault our boss has
poor taste in women.

38:30.123 --> 38:32.355
But, then again...

38:34.083 --> 38:37.237
Someone has to take responsibility
for this fiasco.

38:44.124 --> 38:45.275
Fix your hair.

38:46.244 --> 38:47.395
Sword. rd.

39:02.325 --> 39:06.164
A pure soul is like pure water.

39:06.165 --> 39:09.324
And pure water has no shade and no
color.

39:09.325 --> 39:13.164
It only reflects what it stands
next to.

39:13.165 --> 39:18.244
It's dirt, wind, and salt that
gives it character.

39:18.245 --> 39:23.356
You don't understand. There's evil
inside me and it's kicking.

39:24.246 --> 39:25.325
Life is tough.

39:25.326 --> 39:30.277
But you've done well for yourself,
darling.

39:31.366 --> 39:33.359
Why beat yourself up?

39:36.206 --> 39:38.205
I could've been decent, Lady.

39:38.206 --> 39:40.245
I could've been someone's woman.

39:41.206 --> 39:43.484
And instead, I chose to be
someone's whore.

40:11.208 --> 40:12.359
Good work.

40:14.128 --> 40:15.207
We'll call it...

40:15.208 --> 40:17.127
Gangbusters.

40:17.128 --> 40:20.287
Cowboy and a world without guns
and...

40:20.288 --> 40:22.246
A samurai with no swords.

40:22.247 --> 40:26.447
Team up to defeat...
A common evil.

40:29.167 --> 40:30.318
What's wrong?

40:31.127 --> 40:33.280
You don't wanna be just paper
tiger, huh?

40:33.328 --> 40:37.247
You both fail to understand the
symbolic element...

40:37.248 --> 40:41.327
Of good versus evil enhanced
through the embodiment...

40:41.328 --> 40:48.248
Of the most ancient of human
desires.

40:49.168 --> 40:50.207
Which is what?

40:50.208 --> 40:54.287
To be the most powerful motherfucker
on the face of the planet.

40:54.288 --> 40:57.249
There's no such thing.

40:58.169 --> 41:00.447
There's always someone more
powerful than you.

41:04.289 --> 41:10.128
That is a smart smart line coming
from a young young mind.

41:10.129 --> 41:14.409
But, I was speaking metaphorically.

41:15.129 --> 41:18.209
People need someone to look up to.

41:18.210 --> 41:21.209
A hero is not always the strongest
man.

41:21.210 --> 41:24.329
Sometimes it's just the guy who
leads the way.

41:24.330 --> 41:27.249
Sometimes it's just the guy who
serves the drinks.

41:27.250 --> 41:31.169
I used to believe that once and it
nearly cost me my life.

41:31.170 --> 41:32.401
What happened?

41:37.130 --> 41:38.329
You're still alive.

41:38.330 --> 41:41.130
He took pity on me.

41:41.131 --> 41:44.130
Recon circumstances.

41:44.131 --> 41:48.170
But I went from alive and kicking
to alive and limping.

41:48.171 --> 41:51.330
- And it taught me a great lesson.
- Great lessons.

41:51.331 --> 41:54.130
Are often found in defeat.

41:54.131 --> 41:56.250
Love is temporary.

41:56.251 --> 41:59.291
Hope is eternal.

41:59.331 --> 42:03.486
There is no hope, everything is a
circle.

42:04.212 --> 42:08.331
You know..
Life is not all about fighting.

42:08.332 --> 42:11.452
Come on now, you know that ain't
true.

42:14.092 --> 42:15.323
I can see it in your eyes.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.323
So...

42:23.332 --> 42:25.291
Guess we're up.

42:26.332 --> 42:28.326
I can't loan you the money.

42:31.093 --> 42:32.244
I'm sorry.

42:39.332 --> 42:42.331
These are tough times to trust a
stranger.

42:42.332 --> 42:44.484
But let me warn you.

42:46.212 --> 42:50.212
If you get in my way before I
finish what I came here to do...

42:50.213 --> 42:53.412
That goes the same for you.

43:02.253 --> 43:04.371
So, he lives in a countryside.

43:05.173 --> 43:08.252
And the name's Nine Killers are
like some ancient clan.

43:08.253 --> 43:13.373
- Killers? - When Nicola first came to
power, he led a small gang of only 9 men.

43:13.374 --> 43:16.293
And they became known as The
Killers.

43:16.294 --> 43:20.333
No matter how big Nicola grew, no
matter how powerful he became...

43:20.334 --> 43:23.333
He always continued to keep 9
killers around him.

43:23.334 --> 43:25.253
When one dies or retires...

43:25.254 --> 43:28.293
Nicola inducts a new no. 10 in his
place.

43:28.294 --> 43:30.293
And if they want to advance in the
ranks...

43:30.294 --> 43:32.253
They fight between themselves.

43:32.254 --> 43:35.488
Like vicious watchdogs...
they are his close circle.

43:36.175 --> 43:37.254
His elite force.

43:37.255 --> 43:40.254
These guys are always with him in
his mansion.

43:40.255 --> 43:43.334
And the rest? The Red Suits?

43:43.335 --> 43:46.134
Well, they keep alert at camp.

43:46.135 --> 43:47.334
Where they're all seduced in
training.

43:47.335 --> 43:51.456
Rumor has it, he's got his own
little army out there.

43:55.135 --> 43:56.411
Where is this place?

44:00.136 --> 44:02.335
It's out east in the forest.

44:02.336 --> 44:04.335
Past the mountains.

44:04.336 --> 44:08.411
And between caves and cliffs
and waterfalls.

44:09.176 --> 44:11.175
Nobody knows exactly.

44:11.176 --> 44:15.215
Those who belong, would never talk.

44:15.216 --> 44:18.415
And those who don't...
know better to even ask.

44:19.136 --> 44:20.215
And to top it all off...

44:20.216 --> 44:24.417
No one actually knows what he looks like.
He never shows his face in public.

44:25.217 --> 44:26.296
He never goes some?

44:26.297 --> 44:29.451
People here only know him by his
costume.

44:32.217 --> 44:33.414
What costume?

44:34.337 --> 44:36.336
Long black cape...

44:36.337 --> 44:37.488
And a broad brimmed hat.

44:38.137 --> 44:39.336
Angel of death.

44:39.337 --> 44:41.410
Symbolic to some.

44:44.138 --> 44:46.370
- We're here, Sir.
- Send her in.

44:57.137 --> 44:58.413
Look how beautiful you are.

45:04.297 --> 45:06.449
I remember the day I first laid
eyes on you.

45:14.138 --> 45:15.414
You remember that day?

45:24.098 --> 45:25.217
One might say...

45:25.218 --> 45:28.297
You possess a great enthusiasm.

45:28.298 --> 45:31.453
The opportunity to escape a life of
mediocrity.

45:41.299 --> 45:43.292
It puzzles me.

45:44.139 --> 45:48.419
10 years, you've been looked upon as
nothing but a cold high prized whore.

45:49.179 --> 45:50.178
And yet...

45:50.179 --> 45:54.380
I'd be sitting next to you,
unbeknownst to the onlookers.

45:55.180 --> 45:58.413
And I would marvel at your smile
the most.

46:02.180 --> 46:05.219
As if you possess some higher truth
about life.

46:05.220 --> 46:08.259
Truth only shared by the strongest
of men.

46:08.260 --> 46:10.458
And the most beautiful of women.

46:17.261 --> 46:19.300
Was I imagining that?

46:28.341 --> 46:31.495
So why do you look so miserable
lately?

46:32.301 --> 46:36.422
At the very moment when I'm about
to bestow upon you?

46:38.181 --> 46:40.494
The eyes of a man can bestow on a
woman.

46:42.262 --> 46:46.261
At the very moment when the world
is about to see...

46:46.262 --> 46:49.336
That you are much more than a whore
to me.

46:50.262 --> 46:52.301
If I wanted to be that...

46:52.302 --> 46:55.296
I would've stayed where you found
me.

46:56.182 --> 46:59.302
I'm not getting any younger,
Alexandra.

47:01.342 --> 47:04.222
A man of my age, my position...

47:04.223 --> 47:07.042
Starts to think about what he's
going to leave behind.

47:07.043 --> 47:09.182
Graveyards filled with monuments...

47:09.183 --> 47:10.083
- in your honor?
- No.

47:10.183 --> 47:12.242
After 10 years, a woman like you...

47:12.243 --> 47:15.675
alive, can be a killer heels
for a man like me.

47:17.262 --> 47:19.414
If I was to think...

47:20.222 --> 47:22.261
That there was nothing left to
begotten...

47:22.262 --> 47:25.182
Out of our dearing relationship...

47:25.183 --> 47:27.461
it's now time what I might be prone
to do.

47:31.343 --> 47:32.494
Do it.

47:41.103 --> 47:43.302
No bundle of joy is worth this much
pain.

47:43.303 --> 47:45.222
What do you want from me?

47:45.223 --> 47:47.502
I wanna love you as a free woman.

47:48.184 --> 47:51.263
There are men trying to get me in
every corner.

47:51.264 --> 47:53.143
And you are my woman.

47:53.144 --> 47:56.264
You're the most powerful man east
of the Atlantic.

47:57.224 --> 48:00.344
- What are you so worried about?
- You know I once killed a man...

48:01.184 --> 48:02.381
After a duel...

48:04.104 --> 48:06.263
And with his dying breath, he said
something to me.

48:06.264 --> 48:08.337
And I'll never forget.

48:12.185 --> 48:15.339
There's always someone more
powerful than you.

48:29.185 --> 48:31.264
What are you covering your eyes
for?

48:31.265 --> 48:33.305
- The oriental, Sir.
- He wouldn't talk?

48:33.306 --> 48:35.185
We didn't even get to that, Sir.

48:35.186 --> 48:36.383
I see.

48:37.306 --> 48:41.427
Well, I'm sure you did the best you
could.

48:49.146 --> 48:50.305
This is a private party.

48:50.306 --> 48:54.225
Now, Eddie, does his edge look
edgy?

48:54.226 --> 48:56.300
He just put something in his eye.

49:01.187 --> 49:03.465
Sir, the chief of police is here.

49:17.147 --> 49:18.226
They're all watching us.

49:18.227 --> 49:23.147
There is an oriental ninja
motherfucker walking around town...

49:23.148 --> 49:24.267
Beating up my men.

49:24.268 --> 49:26.347
I don't know if he's here for
Nicola or what his story is.

49:26.348 --> 49:29.347
But considering you couldn't claim
it, I figure it best...

49:29.348 --> 49:31.420
That I would have find out myself.

49:32.227 --> 49:34.379
Ssshhhh...

49:35.227 --> 49:36.424
You hear that?

49:39.227 --> 49:40.378
What?

49:42.148 --> 49:43.379
My bed's calling me.

49:50.268 --> 49:55.227
- You have a lady in the house?
- Not anymore.

49:55.228 --> 49:56.379
I'm sorry.

49:57.308 --> 49:58.307
It's okay.

49:58.308 --> 50:02.187
All loans...

50:02.188 --> 50:05.468
About all capitalism strange bed
fellows.

50:06.269 --> 50:07.420
Huh?

50:09.349 --> 50:11.501
She found a better provider.

50:13.229 --> 50:14.228
So...

50:14.229 --> 50:17.269
Have you decided what you're gonna
do?

50:18.149 --> 50:20.268
I never wanted to come here.

50:20.269 --> 50:22.262
It's my father.

50:23.109 --> 50:24.306
He insisted.

50:24.349 --> 50:27.344
And I had to respect his wish.

50:27.350 --> 50:28.501
Why?

50:30.350 --> 50:32.502
My father is a great man.

50:33.150 --> 50:38.466
Then why would he send you on a mission
that had so much parallel line in its past?

50:44.190 --> 50:47.389
Hey, you, are you the oriental who
calls himself Yoshi?

50:59.311 --> 51:02.510
Mister... you just attacked
4 police officers.

51:34.312 --> 51:35.463
It's me.

51:44.233 --> 51:45.509
Our new friend...

51:46.233 --> 51:47.463
He's in prison.

51:48.152 --> 51:50.384
They're probably working him over
right now.

51:51.232 --> 51:52.508
I thought you'd like to know.

51:53.312 --> 51:54.509
You have a car?

52:18.233 --> 52:22.434
Don't... look... down.

52:24.194 --> 52:25.313
Keep your head up high.

52:25.314 --> 52:27.353
Hold your eyes on the prize.

52:38.354 --> 52:40.506
There is a time to fall.

52:42.194 --> 52:46.270
And time to rise.

52:48.275 --> 52:51.429
Happy Birthday, fucker.

53:16.356 --> 53:18.235
Hey, hey, stop! Stop!

53:18.236 --> 53:19.387
Intruder!

53:41.237 --> 53:42.434
Hold it right there!

54:43.359 --> 54:45.511
Somebody call for a getaway car?

54:49.239 --> 54:50.390
Yoshi!

54:51.119 --> 54:52.270
Yoshi!

54:54.199 --> 54:55.318
They drugged him.

54:55.319 --> 54:57.392
He's not as bad as he looks.

55:03.240 --> 55:05.392
[Chanting]

55:20.160 --> 55:22.312
How can we ever repay you?

55:23.200 --> 55:25.200
Oh, uh...

55:25.201 --> 55:28.200
Ask him, I only drove the car.

55:28.201 --> 55:30.479
Well, thank you for driving the
car.

55:37.201 --> 55:38.352
Thank you.

55:52.362 --> 55:54.361
Listen.

55:54.362 --> 55:56.321
Little girl.

55:58.242 --> 55:59.321
It's only a loan.

55:59.322 --> 56:01.520
Why don't you wait 'til he wakes
up?

56:02.322 --> 56:04.281
Don't dishonor us, Momoko.

56:04.282 --> 56:06.241
I don't trust him.

56:06.242 --> 56:08.394
This man saved your cousin.

56:10.242 --> 56:11.360
Momoko!

56:28.202 --> 56:30.281
I don't seek much pleasure.

56:30.282 --> 56:34.242
From the duel other than the...

56:34.243 --> 56:36.475
Occasional visit from Alexandra.

56:38.163 --> 56:41.317
This precious little entertainment
in my life anymore.

56:42.283 --> 56:46.282
One lousy restaurant I like in this
whole God forsaken town.

56:46.283 --> 56:49.223
One card game I attended...

56:49.323 --> 56:50.520
Not much enjoyment.

56:51.283 --> 56:53.435
For the man who has everything.

56:55.363 --> 56:58.518
I can't go out and have a decent
meal now and again.

56:59.364 --> 57:01.323
Have a card game.

57:01.324 --> 57:03.317
In my own club.

57:04.204 --> 57:05.401
Once a week.

57:06.244 --> 57:08.442
Where's the joy in my existence?

57:10.324 --> 57:12.363
When I put you in charge of my
men...

57:13.284 --> 57:15.323
It wasn't a contract for life.

57:20.165 --> 57:22.363
Who was responsible for being
punished, Sir.

57:24.245 --> 57:25.476
Don't do that.

57:29.125 --> 57:30.284
Not in front of a lady.

57:30.285 --> 57:33.364
Our new problem is actually affiliated
with your favourite restaurant, Sir.

57:33.365 --> 57:36.364
It turns out that the owners have a
cousin.

57:36.365 --> 57:37.364
And?

57:37.365 --> 57:40.284
These men, in the box, they kind of
attacked him.

57:40.285 --> 57:43.485
And then, at the Sheriff's office, they also
attacked him, they thought he was Yakuza.

57:44.326 --> 57:47.325
- And?
- Well, he beat them all pretty bad...

57:47.326 --> 57:49.524
So I told the Police Chief about it
and they locked him up.

57:50.366 --> 57:54.205
- And?
- Some guy broke in last night.

57:54.206 --> 57:56.404
Beat the men and checked him out.

58:00.366 --> 58:01.517
And?

58:03.246 --> 58:05.479
The Japs obviously closed down
their restaurant, Sir.

58:11.247 --> 58:14.446
Sir, about this game tonight...

58:25.287 --> 58:26.438
Good luck.

58:57.248 --> 59:00.368
We don't usually let strangers in
this game.

59:01.368 --> 59:03.520
But you got our boss so curious.

59:05.288 --> 59:06.439
The boss?

59:08.288 --> 59:11.521
My assistant will be playing for
me. I hope you don't mind.

01:00:05.171 --> 01:00:07.250
We play straight poker.

01:00:07.251 --> 01:00:08.448
Any questions?

01:00:10.291 --> 01:00:11.442
We play.

01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:14.443
$5,000 a bet.

01:00:19.291 --> 01:00:21.290
So why don't we all introduce
ourselves...

01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:24.332
Wouldn't want our new friend here
to think us rude.

01:00:24.372 --> 01:00:27.412
Deputy Major, nice to meet you.

01:00:28.132 --> 01:00:29.371
Chief of Police.

01:00:29.372 --> 01:00:30.523
Boris.

01:00:31.252 --> 01:00:33.404
I'm the Head of the Workers Union.

01:00:35.252 --> 01:00:38.251
Quiet impressive bunch was around
wants a card table.

01:00:38.252 --> 01:00:40.530
Things are supposed to be pretty
hunky dory in this puppet town.

01:00:42.252 --> 01:00:44.131
From where I'm looking.

01:00:44.132 --> 01:00:45.364
You know who I am?

01:00:47.373 --> 01:00:49.372
Nicola The Woodcutter.

01:00:49.373 --> 01:00:52.413
Most powerful man east of the
Atlantic.

01:00:53.173 --> 01:00:55.172
Never lost a game or a duel.

01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:56.449
That's right.

01:00:58.212 --> 01:00:59.363
Three.

01:00:59.372 --> 01:01:02.366
- Two.
- So, who would you be?

01:01:03.172 --> 01:01:04.483
I'm just passing through.

01:01:05.292 --> 01:01:06.371
Three.

01:01:06.372 --> 01:01:07.523
Two.

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:21.484
Sit.

01:01:27.253 --> 01:01:29.326
Flush, diamonds, queen on top.

01:01:37.254 --> 01:01:38.253
Raise.

01:01:38.254 --> 01:01:40.532
Five thousand.

01:01:41.294 --> 01:01:42.293
Full house.

01:01:42.294 --> 01:01:43.445
Kings.

01:01:49.254 --> 01:01:50.293
Fold.

01:01:50.294 --> 01:01:52.446
I exceed your five thousand.

01:02:10.295 --> 01:02:12.413
You play a tough game, Mister Just
Passing Through.

01:02:15.175 --> 01:02:16.374
Sure you wanna do that?

01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:18.290
I just did.

01:02:18.376 --> 01:02:20.175
Playing with a full deck?

01:02:20.176 --> 01:02:21.373
I think so.

01:02:23.296 --> 01:02:24.295
Fold.

01:02:24.296 --> 01:02:25.295
Fold.

01:02:25.296 --> 01:02:26.335
Okay...

01:02:26.336 --> 01:02:28.534
Let's take a peek.

01:02:47.217 --> 01:02:48.336
Of course.

01:02:48.337 --> 01:02:50.489
No need to be aggressive.

01:03:14.297 --> 01:03:17.376
You wouldn't happen to have a wrap
it up your sleeve now, would you?

01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:19.416
Just a left.

01:03:21.377 --> 01:03:25.533
From now on, you make sure you keep
your hands on the table.

01:03:39.338 --> 01:03:40.489
Well...

01:03:42.178 --> 01:03:44.330
I guess I'd better be going.

01:03:45.298 --> 01:03:47.450
Yes, me too.

01:03:56.259 --> 01:03:57.490
You ready to cash in?

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:06.378
I think I like you, Mister Just
Passing Through.

01:04:06.379 --> 01:04:09.499
I haven't lost a game of cards in a
curious age, but then again...

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:12.219
I haven't had this much fun,
either.

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:15.294
So on the face, all the answers.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.299
Here.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.879
I won't feel I've earned it
until I play face to face.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.479
That would be a challenge,
would it?

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.595
Call it what you will.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.491
Where?

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.411
The square.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.452
Tomorrow.

01:04:35.301 --> 01:04:36.452
Midnight.

01:04:38.261 --> 01:04:39.412
Enough.

01:04:42.181 --> 01:04:43.412
Let him leave in peace.

01:04:52.261 --> 01:04:53.537
I'll be waiting.

01:05:17.302 --> 01:05:18.453
Wait.

01:05:21.263 --> 01:05:23.336
A hundred years ago...

01:05:23.383 --> 01:05:26.537
My great grandfather came here to
fight in the war.

01:05:29.143 --> 01:05:31.420
He died in one of the toughest
battles.

01:05:32.382 --> 01:05:35.376
And our clans, Cha-Hawk.

01:05:37.182 --> 01:05:38.261
A medallion.

01:05:38.262 --> 01:05:41.341
A golden dragon medallion.

01:05:41.342 --> 01:05:44.262
Passed down from generation to
generation.

01:05:44.263 --> 01:05:46.541
Was stripped away from him.

01:05:47.263 --> 01:05:49.342
Father and I saw it a few weeks
ago.

01:05:49.343 --> 01:05:51.495
In one of Nicola's men in our
restaurant.

01:05:52.343 --> 01:05:54.342
A big man with a big mustache.

01:05:54.343 --> 01:05:56.461
You didn't happen to see anyone...

01:05:57.263 --> 01:06:00.417
Wearing a golden medallion, did
you?

01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:09.303
Nothing rings a bell.

01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:12.335
You're lying.

01:06:16.144 --> 01:06:17.341
You should teach her to cook.

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:24.303
This medallion,

01:06:24.304 --> 01:06:26.377
What's so special about it?

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:28.460
You wouldn't understand.

01:06:32.185 --> 01:06:33.541
I guess I wouldn't.

01:06:38.225 --> 01:06:40.503
I'm telling you there is something
in the air.

01:06:42.305 --> 01:06:46.505
Both of these... characters running
around men are falling off fast.

01:06:47.225 --> 01:06:48.376
So let me nip it.

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:51.378
Men like us... Number 2...

01:06:53.386 --> 01:06:55.379
Why is it that we fight?

01:06:57.226 --> 01:07:00.225
It's about how thin the air is at
the point of dying.

01:07:00.226 --> 01:07:04.506
It's about how it feels to... breathe
even if it's only for a split second.

01:07:08.186 --> 01:07:09.225
Fair enough.

01:07:09.226 --> 01:07:12.346
You can reach this for this is
ridiculous!

01:07:20.267 --> 01:07:21.464
Not so to hope.

01:07:47.268 --> 01:07:50.226
Number 4 will be watching you
closely.

01:07:50.227 --> 01:07:52.346
We want to know who he is.

01:07:52.347 --> 01:07:54.386
You can bring him back in pieces
for all I care...

01:07:54.387 --> 01:07:55.459
But...

01:07:56.387 --> 01:08:00.304
- A lot for this.
- That's what we do.

01:08:02.308 --> 01:08:03.459
Yoshi!

01:08:04.368 --> 01:08:05.787
# Stay inside. #

01:08:05.788 --> 01:08:07.187
# I can help you. #

01:08:07.188 --> 01:08:10.387
# You can help me more
by staying safe. #

01:08:11.268 --> 01:08:14.227
# I know this town inside out. #

01:08:14.228 --> 01:08:15.425
# Take her. #

01:08:16.388 --> 01:08:21.339
# You ruined my business...
My home. #

01:08:21.348 --> 01:08:26.460
# We have to hide here
like stray dogs. #

01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:30.228
# Last week you almost
got yourself killed. #

01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:31.505
# Is that not enough? #

01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:35.423
# Or won't you rest until Momoko
follows in your footsteps? #

01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:39.348
# I have an 'obligation'. #

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:41.341
# You don't owe anything
to this man. #

01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:43.341
# He is a foreigner. #

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:48.381
# What happened to you? #

01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:53.229
# Where is your pride.
Your honor? #

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:54.229
# Honor? #

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:56.428
# You stay here another day... #

01:08:57.229 --> 01:09:00.389
# And someone is going o die. #

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:01.541
# Yoshi... #

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:04.229
# Your father #

01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:06.269
# Didn't send you here... #

01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:08.189
# For a medallion. #

01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:10.189
# He sent you here... #

01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:12.270
# To become a man. #

01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:13.602
# His kind of man. #

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.350
# And this path. #

01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:20.149
# Though glorified. #

01:09:20.151 --> 01:09:22.429
# Leads only to destruction! #

01:10:34.353 --> 01:10:36.505
Take off your hat.

01:11:28.416 --> 01:11:29.815
<i>Bad hand.</i>

01:11:30.216 --> 01:11:31.614
<i>Bad timing.</i>

01:11:34.196 --> 01:11:35.315
Timing.

01:11:35.316 --> 01:11:37.434
That's what it's all about.

01:11:38.276 --> 01:11:41.350
You duck keep hunch you stay alive.

01:11:42.276 --> 01:11:44.275
Don't look at the cards big boy.

01:11:44.276 --> 01:11:46.315
Nobody's that good.

01:11:46.316 --> 01:11:48.468
Who's the fucker now?

01:12:03.317 --> 01:12:04.316
Hey Mister!

01:12:04.317 --> 01:12:07.236
Nicola asked me to inform you...

01:12:07.237 --> 01:12:09.276
That if you really wanna beat the
house...

01:12:09.277 --> 01:12:11.509
You first must beat the odds.

01:12:50.198 --> 01:12:53.317
The first drop of blood changes
everything.

01:12:53.318 --> 01:12:55.470
Carrying an undeniable intention...

01:12:56.238 --> 01:13:00.398
It is always a painful reminder that a
violent solution can never be realised.

01:13:00.399 --> 01:13:03.314
Without putting one's life at
stake.

01:13:11.399 --> 01:13:12.550
Where is he?

01:13:14.199 --> 01:13:15.350
He's gone.

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.577
# Step aside. #

01:13:58.321 --> 01:14:01.475
Nicola loves your restaurant
old man.

01:14:02.281 --> 01:14:04.613
Likes those fish.

01:14:05.361 --> 01:14:08.516
But me I'm a vegetarian.

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:12.516
Now where is Yoshi?

01:14:32.243 --> 01:14:33.162
# Father! #

01:14:33.763 --> 01:14:34.814
# Father! #

01:14:39.323 --> 01:14:40.282
# Like an aged tree... #

01:14:41.783 --> 01:14:43.836
# Which yields no blossoms. #

01:14:45.782 --> 01:14:47.581
# Cheerful my life has been. #

01:14:48.382 --> 01:14:50.014
# Bearing but a single fruit. #

01:15:05.243 --> 01:15:09.202
You know kid I think I should keep
some of it for later hey?

01:15:09.203 --> 01:15:12.362
I got me a little genius intrigue
has given me one...

01:15:12.363 --> 01:15:14.515
Hot idea.

01:15:49.245 --> 01:15:50.396
One more.

01:15:58.205 --> 01:16:00.357
You wanna know what took me so
long?

01:16:00.405 --> 01:16:01.557
Not really.

01:16:46.247 --> 01:16:47.445
Time to go gents!

01:17:26.168 --> 01:17:27.319
Pull over.

01:17:27.368 --> 01:17:29.407
What are you talking about? They're
right behind us.

01:17:29.408 --> 01:17:32.483
The only place we're going in this
car is to a lamp post.

01:17:52.289 --> 01:17:54.441
Never underestimate the power of
these wheels.

01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:09.369
So?

01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:11.521
Impressive?

01:18:24.511 --> 01:18:26.330
<i>Play time is over kids.</i>

01:18:26.531 --> 01:18:27.610
Take it easy.

01:18:27.811 --> 01:18:29.529
<i>It's time to face the killers.</i>

01:18:30.251 --> 01:18:32.630
<i>Time to man up.</i>

01:18:32.631 --> 01:18:33.728
Good luck gents.

01:18:39.211 --> 01:18:40.210
Which one do you want?

01:18:40.211 --> 01:18:41.723
I'd better take the swordsman.

01:23:01.221 --> 01:23:03.533
Wait Momoko and your uncle
are they still at the hotel?

01:23:04.221 --> 01:23:05.372
God!

01:23:32.222 --> 01:23:34.374
Momoko! Uncle!

01:23:47.303 --> 01:23:50.342
My uncle... is dead.

01:23:52.222 --> 01:23:55.342
Momoko... is gone.

01:24:02.223 --> 01:24:03.454
This is not the way.

01:24:12.263 --> 01:24:15.417
This is the only way.

01:24:19.343 --> 01:24:21.342
They've got your cousin now.

01:24:21.343 --> 01:24:23.495
And we can't kill what we can't
find.

01:24:27.424 --> 01:24:28.575
We?

01:24:31.304 --> 01:24:33.456
I think it's time you gentlemen...

01:24:34.264 --> 01:24:35.540
Meet the general.

01:24:44.224 --> 01:24:45.455
Get her ready for me.

01:24:46.264 --> 01:24:47.462
Don't be afraid.

01:24:48.305 --> 01:24:50.184
He may walk like a cock...

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:52.337
And talk like a cock...

01:24:53.185 --> 01:24:56.264
And look like one too but from what
I hear...

01:24:56.265 --> 01:24:58.383
it's all for compensation.

01:25:10.386 --> 01:25:12.345
That's the spirit!

01:25:15.426 --> 01:25:17.499
See tomorrow love...

01:25:18.266 --> 01:25:21.725
I got a quick errand to run
a little thing called... death to deliver.

01:25:21.726 --> 01:25:22.698
Death?

01:25:23.226 --> 01:25:24.345
There's no messengers.

01:25:24.346 --> 01:25:26.225
It delivers itself.

01:25:26.226 --> 01:25:29.505
Usually in the most adequate way
when dealing with impersonators.

01:25:32.386 --> 01:25:35.507
I bet that sounds much better in
Japanese.

01:25:58.388 --> 01:26:01.587
Number 4 and 7 are dead Sir.

01:26:04.348 --> 01:26:06.500
I couldn't fall asleep tonight.

01:26:10.347 --> 01:26:12.186
That stranger was right.

01:26:12.187 --> 01:26:13.543
I should've taken the risk.

01:26:14.187 --> 01:26:15.543
As wrong fat and Lazy.

01:26:18.227 --> 01:26:19.504
You mean... this card game?

01:26:21.428 --> 01:26:23.421
I know what you're thinking.

01:26:24.268 --> 01:26:26.546
You're thinking you'll stop them in
the cab.

01:26:27.388 --> 01:26:29.540
They'll come for her and for me.

01:26:30.428 --> 01:26:32.467
And you'll stop it right there.

01:26:33.428 --> 01:26:35.421
Do you know what you want?

01:26:36.348 --> 01:26:38.267
I don't know if you're trying to
protect me...

01:26:38.268 --> 01:26:40.387
Or replace me...

01:26:40.388 --> 01:26:41.428
Number 2.

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:43.581
- I would never...
- Never what?

01:26:45.349 --> 01:26:48.188
You're just about running the show
right now.

01:26:48.189 --> 01:26:49.268
The only difference is...

01:26:49.269 --> 01:26:51.387
The risk is still on my head.

01:26:54.389 --> 01:26:55.586
What do you think?

01:26:57.429 --> 01:26:59.502
You want a shot at the title?

01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:27.350
I didn't get to be who I am by
hiding.

01:27:27.351 --> 01:27:30.430
The costume is just a device to
prolong my rule.

01:27:30.431 --> 01:27:33.346
Costumes never age.

01:27:33.391 --> 01:27:34.542
People do.

01:27:39.351 --> 01:27:40.502
You know...

01:27:41.391 --> 01:27:43.543
There's a part of me...

01:27:46.351 --> 01:27:48.190
And kill you all.

01:27:48.191 --> 01:27:50.470
And that there's no one left for
them to fight but me.

01:27:51.352 --> 01:27:52.549
And then if I die...

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:56.551
It will be like I always thought it
would be.

01:27:57.432 --> 01:27:58.583
In battle.

01:28:00.312 --> 01:28:01.588
While I'm still craving life.

01:28:02.432 --> 01:28:04.431
Well they won't get pass the camp.

01:28:04.432 --> 01:28:06.311
We'll see.

01:28:06.312 --> 01:28:07.311
Either way...

01:28:07.312 --> 01:28:10.352
You're staying with me.

01:28:21.313 --> 01:28:22.544
How much longer?

01:28:23.393 --> 01:28:24.589
A couple of hours.

01:28:28.432 --> 01:28:30.431
You still haven't told me...

01:28:30.432 --> 01:28:32.391
Why are you here?

01:28:34.352 --> 01:28:36.505
I didn't come for some necklace.

01:28:37.313 --> 01:28:38.464
Medallion.

01:28:39.313 --> 01:28:40.464
Medallion.

01:28:47.233 --> 01:28:50.232
<i>Some people die for that rag
they call a flag.</i>

01:28:50.233 --> 01:28:52.392
<i>Some die for a line in a map...</i>

01:28:52.393 --> 01:28:54.272
<i>Some die for a necklace...</i>

01:28:54.273 --> 01:28:56.432
<i>Others die for revenge.</i>

01:28:56.633 --> 01:28:57.784
<i>But freedom...</i>

01:28:58.313 --> 01:29:01.273
<i>Now there's an idea
you can sell to the people.</i>

01:29:01.274 --> 01:29:04.473
They call themselves the
proletarian league of defense.

01:29:05.234 --> 01:29:08.313
- Who are they?
- Business owners sick of being extorted...

01:29:08.314 --> 01:29:11.233
Angry fathers worried about their
daughters.

01:29:11.234 --> 01:29:15.273
Men and women who are all frustrated
by the incompetence of the law.

01:29:15.274 --> 01:29:16.393
They come from all over.

01:29:16.394 --> 01:29:17.433
Secretly trained here...

01:29:17.434 --> 01:29:20.353
And they are finally ready to
fight.

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:22.587
We need information and weapons and
that's it.

01:29:23.235 --> 01:29:25.433
Nicola has 120 men down there.

01:29:25.435 --> 01:29:27.934
Now that's a lot to handle
even for the both of you.

01:29:27.935 --> 01:29:28.834
There is only one man...

01:29:28.835 --> 01:29:30.834
and it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier
to get through...

01:29:30.835 --> 01:29:33.274
without this circus sluggish town.

01:29:33.275 --> 01:29:34.394
What about my cousin?

01:29:34.395 --> 01:29:35.592
Same goes for her.

01:29:36.355 --> 01:29:37.552
What about them?

01:29:39.355 --> 01:29:40.552
What about them?

01:29:41.315 --> 01:29:45.437
Right now... They're your only chance
at a new beginning.

01:29:53.196 --> 01:29:55.348
Excellent timing.

01:29:56.316 --> 01:30:00.471
That's what every great military
leader needs.

01:30:01.316 --> 01:30:03.514
A sense of timing.

01:30:04.356 --> 01:30:07.396
The general is the only one who
knows the secret passages...

01:30:07.397 --> 01:30:09.316
To the camp and cliff.

01:30:09.317 --> 01:30:11.316
But he vowed he would never tell.

01:30:11.317 --> 01:30:13.469
Before the right time came.

01:30:20.277 --> 01:30:22.555
This is the right thing to do.

01:30:27.437 --> 01:30:30.437
I'm not leading this army of clowns...
to the grim labor.

01:30:30.438 --> 01:30:32.397
They've already made their choice.

01:30:32.398 --> 01:30:34.397
Now you need to make yours.

01:30:34.398 --> 01:30:36.550
Walk away and you may never find
him.

01:30:41.238 --> 01:30:42.388
Hey...

01:30:43.437 --> 01:30:46.511
They robbed my family of
everything.

01:30:47.357 --> 01:30:48.436
They killed my uncle.

01:30:48.437 --> 01:30:49.588
And still have my cousin.

01:30:50.317 --> 01:30:53.472
And the man who leads them must
have done something to you.

01:30:58.318 --> 01:31:00.470
We can end this!

01:31:09.278 --> 01:31:10.509
Gangbusters huh?

01:31:14.318 --> 01:31:15.549
Alright coaches.

01:32:38.442 --> 01:32:39.441
Stop it.

01:32:39.442 --> 01:32:42.562
You fool don't you want to live?

01:32:43.282 --> 01:32:44.513
I'd rather die.

01:32:46.282 --> 01:32:47.513
Let's give it a rest.

01:32:48.363 --> 01:32:49.514
Vultures.

01:32:51.243 --> 01:32:52.554
That's what we all should've done.

01:35:55.409 --> 01:35:56.560
Get out!

01:35:57.289 --> 01:35:58.600
Just get out!

01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:16.441
Momoko.

01:37:00.452 --> 01:37:01.603
Alexandra.

01:37:04.292 --> 01:37:05.443
Alexandra!

01:37:29.373 --> 01:37:30.772
- # Cousin.
- You okay? #

01:37:30.773 --> 01:37:31.724
I'm fine.

01:37:46.413 --> 01:37:48.565
Got a hundred men behind you now.

01:37:49.373 --> 01:37:50.412
He could wait...

01:37:50.413 --> 01:37:52.611
Eventually he'll have to come down.

01:37:56.453 --> 01:37:58.605
All I want is my piece
of the bargain.

01:38:00.293 --> 01:38:01.292
Some bargain.

01:38:01.793 --> 01:38:02.844
Yeah.

01:38:08.254 --> 01:38:09.530
There's a waterfall...

01:38:10.254 --> 01:38:11.373
Straight up this road.

01:38:11.374 --> 01:38:14.807
Can't miss it, just...
walk through.

01:38:18.294 --> 01:38:20.453
He would've been proud of you,
you know.

01:38:20.454 --> 01:38:23.448
When I was a kid
he was around, but...

01:38:24.374 --> 01:38:25.605
He was a legend here.

01:38:33.255 --> 01:38:35.709
You still want to get yourself killed
for some necklace?

01:38:51.375 --> 01:38:54.455
<i>Revenge is an act of style.</i>

01:38:54.456 --> 01:38:56.455
<i>For all practical matters...</i>

01:38:56.456 --> 01:38:59.295
<i>No one is known to come back
from the dead.</i>

01:38:59.296 --> 01:39:01.528
<i>After being avenged
in the name of justice.</i>

01:39:03.336 --> 01:39:07.155
<i>However so men can fight anything
but his nature.</i>

01:39:07.556 --> 01:39:11.115
<i>An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth will
forever make better grammatical balance.</i>

01:39:11.416 --> 01:39:13.034
<i>By turning the other cheek.</i>

01:39:46.079 --> 01:39:47.377
<i>Up they go.</i>

01:39:47.378 --> 01:39:49.530
<i>To face their own destiny.</i>

01:39:50.718 --> 01:39:52.457
<i>Step by step.</i>

01:39:52.758 --> 01:39:54.372
<i>Groan by groan.</i>

01:39:55.257 --> 01:39:56.336
<i>Four down...</i>

01:39:56.337 --> 01:39:57.376
<i>Six to go...</i>

01:39:57.477 --> 01:39:59.656
<i>For Nicola and his killers.</i>

01:39:59.957 --> 01:40:01.530
<i>To be no more.</i>

01:43:39.306 --> 01:43:40.457
He's mine.

01:44:00.468 --> 01:44:04.384
I'd cook your own
yellow tail sushi roll.

01:44:54.348 --> 01:44:56.500
Pretty optimistic aren't you?

01:44:58.268 --> 01:45:01.468
To be worried about your mustache
when you're about to lose your head.

01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:45.423
Been waiting long.

01:45:47.311 --> 01:45:48.508
Who are you?

01:45:50.391 --> 01:45:51.542
A son.

01:45:52.391 --> 01:45:53.470
A friend.

01:45:53.471 --> 01:45:55.623
A brother what does it matter?

01:45:57.272 --> 01:45:59.424
It matters not if you die.

01:46:00.472 --> 01:46:04.388
But if you live and not tell then in
years if you stab me in the back...

01:46:09.272 --> 01:46:11.391
Unlike you I've never stabbed
anyone in the back.

01:46:11.392 --> 01:46:13.311
You wanna kill a man like me son...

01:46:13.312 --> 01:46:15.431
You'd better stab me in the back.

01:46:15.432 --> 01:46:17.391
That's the catch.

01:46:18.312 --> 01:46:22.433
Honorable men... well they die
hard.

01:46:22.472 --> 01:46:24.431
But they fear dying.

01:46:26.432 --> 01:46:28.471
It's men like me who survive.

01:46:28.472 --> 01:46:30.431
And conquer.

01:46:31.272 --> 01:46:36.463
Men like me who understand the fight is not
about who's right but about who's lived.

01:46:38.234 --> 01:46:39.465
You see this hand son?

01:46:42.433 --> 01:46:46.507
These hands have taken the lives of
a hundred men.

01:46:47.432 --> 01:46:50.351
These eyes have seen the last breaths
heavy from a hundred chests.

01:46:50.352 --> 01:46:51.352
And these feet...

01:46:51.353 --> 01:46:53.431
Have stood over a hundred fools...

01:46:53.432 --> 01:46:55.312
Who thought they were gonna kill
me.

01:46:55.313 --> 01:46:57.392
But my heart is still pounding.

01:46:57.393 --> 01:46:58.465
Waiting.

01:46:58.473 --> 01:47:00.625
For the day when it meets its
equal.

01:47:26.274 --> 01:47:28.393
I thought you were different
somehow.

01:47:28.394 --> 01:47:29.473
Special.

01:47:29.474 --> 01:47:30.625
After all...

01:47:31.394 --> 01:47:33.546
You beat the odds twice.

01:47:34.235 --> 01:47:35.353
But here you are...

01:47:35.354 --> 01:47:38.473
Bleeding all over my floor just
like the rest.

01:47:38.474 --> 01:47:42.550
Another fool in search of his ride
to the sunset.

01:47:49.435 --> 01:47:51.587
Now you're gonna tell me who you
are...

01:47:52.395 --> 01:47:54.547
Or I'm gonna have to beat it out of
you.

01:48:19.276 --> 01:48:21.508
You wanna know the truth son?

01:48:23.276 --> 01:48:25.474
It's all about the next day.

01:48:26.317 --> 01:48:28.317
When the sun rises...

01:48:28.318 --> 01:48:29.594
Can you smell the air?

01:48:30.397 --> 01:48:32.549
When you realise life goes on.

01:48:33.277 --> 01:48:35.429
There is no judge.

01:48:36.437 --> 01:48:39.477
The air is thin at the point of
dying.

01:49:14.358 --> 01:49:15.555
You want honor.

01:49:16.278 --> 01:49:18.430
And I give you deception.

01:49:19.358 --> 01:49:20.634
You want justice?

01:49:24.278 --> 01:49:25.554
You want closure?

01:49:26.318 --> 01:49:27.594
I'll give you this.

01:49:37.319 --> 01:49:38.470
Yoshi.

01:49:39.279 --> 01:49:40.430
Yoshi.

01:49:41.399 --> 01:49:43.392
No... No...

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.279
Trying to teach you a lesson
here...

01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:09.477
And you learn nothing?

01:50:20.401 --> 01:50:22.553
I'm gonna miss you son.

01:50:26.321 --> 01:50:27.472
Last chance.

01:50:28.441 --> 01:50:29.592
Who are you?

01:50:39.321 --> 01:50:41.473
Someone who once told me...

01:50:42.481 --> 01:50:45.636
There's always somebody more
powerful than you.

01:50:48.483 --> 01:50:49.481
Problem is...

01:50:49.482 --> 01:50:52.522
Where is he now?

01:50:57.322 --> 01:50:59.474
When you need him most?

01:51:44.363 --> 01:51:45.639
The man who told you this...

01:51:48.324 --> 01:51:49.555
Was my father.

01:52:24.285 --> 01:52:25.364
Are you sure about this?

01:52:25.365 --> 01:52:27.597
We're gonna try something new
together.

01:52:29.286 --> 01:52:32.444
A bar that also serves sushi and
sake.

01:52:32.445 --> 01:52:34.444
You know you could've been there.

01:52:34.445 --> 01:52:37.364
You could've been chief of police.

01:52:37.365 --> 01:52:38.563
Who me?

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:43.285
No son. I serve the drinks.

01:52:43.286 --> 01:52:45.438
I always serve the drinks.

01:52:45.446 --> 01:52:49.405
I fought so I can continue serving
drinks freely.

01:52:49.406 --> 01:52:52.405
Not to take up arms for the rest of
my life.

01:52:52.406 --> 01:52:54.558
See that's the problem.

01:52:58.366 --> 01:53:00.285
'Cos everything is a circle.

01:53:00.286 --> 01:53:02.366
Yeah but for every son of a bitch
out there...

01:53:02.367 --> 01:53:04.519
There's men like you.

01:53:05.287 --> 01:53:06.438
And you.

01:53:08.447 --> 01:53:10.440
No balance is out.

01:53:13.367 --> 01:53:15.440
So gentlemen...

01:53:18.327 --> 01:53:20.479
Good luck on your journeys.

01:53:45.227 --> 01:53:46.148
What?

01:54:01.208 --> 01:54:02.259
So...

01:54:03.888 --> 01:54:05.666
What are you going to do?

01:54:07.368 --> 01:54:09.647
I'm the product
of a fucked up generation.

01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:23.484
I can't even seem to find a sunset
to walk off into.

01:54:24.089 --> 01:54:25.440
Tomorrow.

01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:27.560
Is a new day.

01:54:31.609 --> 01:54:33.449
Until the next time.

01:54:35.490 --> 01:54:38.289
<i>Tomorrow is a new day.</i>

01:54:38.290 --> 01:54:40.602
<i>The sun will rise and set again.</i>

01:54:41.290 --> 01:54:43.409
<i>In this endless circle of life.</i>

01:54:43.410 --> 01:54:45.449
<i>And strife.</i>
