00:01.002 --> 00:02.287
(Audrey): Previously on Haven...

00:02.420 --> 00:05.628
- Croatoan really will kill
everyone in Haven.

00:07.049 --> 00:08.255
You shouldn't go back.

00:09.385 --> 00:10.716
- Nathan!

00:12.346 --> 00:14.211
Is that...
(Nathan): The controller.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.555
We're one step closer
to building a new Barn,

00:16.684 --> 00:18.675
to ending the Troubles.
- So we found it,

00:18.811 --> 00:20.187
but we don't know what it does
or how to use it.

00:20.313 --> 00:22.144
- And we will figure it out.

00:22.857 --> 00:26.896
- In your fight with Croatoan,
visualize your battlefield.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.143
- Hiya, Croatoan!

00:29.030 --> 00:30.566
(typewriter olacking)

00:30.698 --> 00:32.108
(Croatoan): You came here to kill me?

00:32.241 --> 00:33.777
You’re the one who’s in danger.

00:33.910 --> 00:36.401
- You used me to kill people!

00:36.537 --> 00:40.746
- I’ve been absorbing Troubles.
[7/ enter your world on my own.

00:40.875 --> 00:41.910
- While you were in there,

00:42.043 --> 00:45.160
Croatoan's been making us lose time
over and over again.

00:45.296 --> 00:48.504
- I can go back into my mind palace
and destroy those clocks.

00:48.633 --> 00:52.296
I can destroy Croatoan's ability
to cause lost time.

00:53.471 --> 00:56.429
I hate to break it to you, Cro,
but I'm not going anywhere.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.639
(rumbling)

00:58.768 --> 01:00.133
- Wake up, damn it.

01:00.269 --> 01:01.475
- He died well.

01:01.604 --> 01:02.810
It’s time.

01:02.939 --> 01:06.022
(rumbling)

01:09.528 --> 01:12.440
(Vince): lt's Dave's handwriting.
He got a message to us.

01:20.957 --> 01:23.949
(indistinct chatter)

01:25.211 --> 01:28.294
(tools whirring)

01:33.719 --> 01:36.756
- Stan, what's our ETA
on going live with the security cameras?

01:36.889 --> 01:38.880
- At least another three hours, maybe more.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.722
- Three hours?
- Maybe more.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.058
- Croatoan is coming for Audrey.

01:43.187 --> 01:44.973
This is where
we're making our stand.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.518
We need to be able to see
every inch of the station.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.151
You okay?
- Yeah.

02:04.375 --> 02:07.663
- You know, it's okay if you're not.
- No, it's not.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.460
l have been trying all night.

02:10.589 --> 02:14.298
l have to get these things to do something.
- You will.

02:15.428 --> 02:17.635
- If we can't build a new Barn,

02:17.763 --> 02:19.424
we can't defeat Croatoan.

02:19.557 --> 02:24.267
- Well, then, let's try
for only happy thoughts today.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.017
(Laverne): Gentlemen,
this building is older than dirt.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.937
Watch your amperage.
You’re overloading the circuits.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.279
- Laverne's on fire today.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.361
- She's not loving
working with the Guard.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.947
- Now, could someone
get their ass to the basement

02:39.076 --> 02:41.283
and replace the breakers?
We ’re burning daylight, fellas.

02:41.412 --> 02:42.697
Full sail, please!

02:42.830 --> 02:45.913
- Can you just get her to calm down,
so the Guard guys don't revolt?

02:51.297 --> 02:53.379
- Laverne, you read?
- Loud and clear.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.835
- You might want to ease up a bit.

02:55.968 --> 02:59.085
- It’s like none of these knuckle-draggers
have ever done electrical work before.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.132
- Well, most of them haven't.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.756
- And yet they call themselves men.

03:06.312 --> 03:08.678
- You got the Trouble census?

03:09.607 --> 03:13.225
- Yeah, it's... here.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.654
- Laverne, Karl,
the guy with the acid touch Trouble?

03:19.784 --> 03:21.320
- Yeah, what do you need?

03:21.452 --> 03:23.158
- Make sure he uses it to melt the locks,

03:23.287 --> 03:25.494
seal the specified entrances
around the building.

03:25.623 --> 03:26.658
- I’m on it.

03:26.791 --> 03:29.999
Son of a bitch! Nathan, I’m gonna kill
those freaking morons.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.209
They just fried my damn console.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.999
- She's having a bad day.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.508
- Yeah, well, join the club.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.425
I thought... I don't know.
I just thought that once we got

03:40.554 --> 03:42.340
the aether core
and the controller crystal together,

03:42.473 --> 03:46.466
that they would show us
what we needed to do next.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.100
- You want coffee?

03:50.314 --> 03:52.430
- Please.
- I'll get you one,

03:52.566 --> 03:54.727
right after I check the perimeter.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.241
- You sure guarding Audrey here
is a good idea?

04:04.370 --> 04:07.703
I'm sure it's the best
of all the bad ideas we got.

04:07.832 --> 04:08.912
- Right.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.747
Here, Dwight sent this.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.083
- How's he doing
with the exterior perimeter?

04:13.212 --> 04:15.248
- Eh, he's locking down the streets now.

04:15.381 --> 04:16.666
He's got his hands full.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.500
Guard doesn't exactly
have Army Ranger training.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.596
- Grenades?

04:26.892 --> 04:28.553
- Plan B.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.677
In case Croatoan gets in, I guess.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.391
- I told Audrey only happy thoughts today.

04:33.524 --> 04:37.392
- It's kind of hard when what we're fighting
could be anyone, anything.

04:37.528 --> 04:40.361
Hell, it could still be that green mist.
At least when it was Dave,

04:40.489 --> 04:42.571
we knew where it was.
- | get it.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.072
Audrey's a target.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.408
We don't have any idea
what we're up against.

04:46.537 --> 04:48.903
Why do you think we're installing
all these damn cameras?

04:49.790 --> 04:50.905
- So you're freaked out.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.292
- Is it that obvious?

04:52.418 --> 04:54.579
- No, I'd say you're keeping
it together pretty well,

04:54.712 --> 04:57.203
considering we're about to fight
a mass murderer from another world.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.206
- I hope it doesn't get that far.

05:01.260 --> 05:04.502
We just need to hold Croatoan off
long enough for Audrey to figure out

05:04.638 --> 05:06.549
how to get the new Barn
up and running.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.801
- How's that going?

05:12.980 --> 05:14.845
- Been to the Gull
since you've been back?

05:15.232 --> 05:16.938
- What's left of her.

05:18.235 --> 05:21.102
You know, if you had told me
a few years ago

05:21.238 --> 05:22.648
that my bar was gonna get thrashed

05:22.781 --> 05:25.397
by a Trouble
that creates sea monsters, l...

05:29.079 --> 05:30.944
Now it just sounds
like Tuesday.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.827
- Remember when we were kids?

05:34.919 --> 05:38.002
Thought the Troubles
were just scary stories

05:38.130 --> 05:40.291
parents told us
to keep us in line.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.289
- And then we found out
that our fathers knew

05:42.426 --> 05:44.758
exactly what
we were getting into.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.590
I guess ljust wish
that we had known this was our fate,

05:52.770 --> 05:54.306
because”.

05:55.940 --> 05:58.522
I mean, I would have spent
a lot less time in school.

05:58.651 --> 06:00.983
- You could not have possibly
spent less time in school.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.521
- That is true.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.778
- And you're wrong.

06:05.491 --> 06:06.822
We forge our own paths.

06:06.951 --> 06:09.158
I'm not the same cop
that my father was.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.995
But eventually
he respected that.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.579
He was proud of me.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.828
- Oh, come on, Ned Flanders.

06:16.961 --> 06:19.293
Your dad was
always proud of you.

06:19.964 --> 06:21.044
- You're kidding?

06:21.632 --> 06:24.840
It took years before he started
to take me seriously.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.794
Right after I collared McGuinness.
That's when he came around.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.137
- Nick McGuinness?

06:31.308 --> 06:34.766
- Yeah.
- Big on dreams, lousy on execution.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.511
Heavy on the aftershave.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.014
- I didn't realize
you knew him so well.

06:40.693 --> 06:41.728
- Eh.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.402
- Ha.

06:45.531 --> 06:47.112
I always thought
there was no way

06:47.241 --> 06:48.606
that he could smuggle
those computer chips

06:48.742 --> 06:50.357
in and out of port
without inside help.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.700
Was it you?

06:51.829 --> 06:54.366
- Well, you know,
let's just say that, um,

06:56.542 --> 06:58.908
we had common interests
at one time.

07:00.004 --> 07:02.586
Well, then you started
poking around, and...

07:03.924 --> 07:05.664
it just wasn't worth the heat.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.008
- So you dimed him out?

07:12.016 --> 07:15.679
Someone sent me those manifests.
That was you?

07:15.811 --> 07:17.927
- I never did like competition.

07:18.063 --> 07:21.976
- No, you would have made way more money
if you guys had partnered up.

07:23.277 --> 07:26.815
Hey, I remember,
a week before I brought McGuinness in,

07:29.283 --> 07:32.901
I told you that
l was thinking about quitting.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.363
You gave me McGuinness,

07:39.460 --> 07:41.951
so I would look good to the chief.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.169
- Well, maybe, maybe not.

07:45.049 --> 07:46.755
-Wha...

07:50.220 --> 07:52.757
We make our own future, Duke.

07:54.558 --> 07:57.220
Back then and now.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.761
- I hope you're right, Nathan.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.562
(phone rings and vibrates)

08:06.403 --> 08:09.315
Uh, I got to make a call.

08:11.075 --> 08:12.690
- You want to secure these
in the armory?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.407
- Yeah.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.372
(clattering)

08:21.502 --> 08:24.835
- Don't you dare look at me like that.
I know what you're saying about me.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.458
- Vince, no one's blaming you.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.297
- I hear what they're whispering.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.259
"The old fool didn't even know
his brother was Croatoan's puppet."

08:32.388 --> 08:33.298
- No one knew.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.806
- But they all blame me.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.093
I could see it in their faces.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.966
They think I should
have done something.

08:39.103 --> 08:40.593
- Well, then they're idiots.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.811
- Come on, Vince,
don't make this any harder.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.305
- Stay back!
Back!

08:45.776 --> 08:48.939
Croatoan used my brother.
He killed Dave!

08:50.114 --> 08:52.696
(overlapping chatter)
(Nathan): Drop it, drop it.

08:52.825 --> 08:55.282
- It's not my fault.
Let me go!

09:00.958 --> 09:02.994
I didn't help him.

09:04.086 --> 09:06.452
I couldn't help him.

09:06.797 --> 09:09.630
- He'll be out for a while.
We'll take him to the infirmary.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.168
- Can you just stay with him?

09:12.469 --> 09:15.427
(crashing, clattering)

09:19.643 --> 09:21.144
- What the hell is this?

09:23.480 --> 09:26.222
- You all right?
- Except for almost being flattened, yeah.

09:28.902 --> 09:29.891
Crocker.

09:31.155 --> 09:33.521
- You manned up since the last time
we've seen each other.

09:33.657 --> 09:36.865
- I thought you hightailed it out of Haven
after you gave us these godforsaken Troubles.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.484
- Yeah, well, I'm back.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.406
- Lucky us.
- Enough.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.325
- Alex?

09:51.008 --> 09:51.997
- It's not me.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.722
(Nathan): You want to get the door?

10:07.483 --> 10:08.848
(Alex): Karl...

10:11.236 --> 10:13.693
(Nathan): He was supposed to be sealing
the entrances with his Trouble.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.358
(Audrey): The whole building
was on lockdown.

10:15.491 --> 10:16.731
How could this have happened?

10:16.867 --> 10:19.028
- If the cameras were up, we'd know.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.243
- Croatoan's here, isn't he?

10:24.416 --> 10:27.032
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.080
His victims were killed
with no marks on them.

10:29.213 --> 10:30.248
This is not his MO.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.507
- Well, we got to get out of here.
- And go where?

10:32.633 --> 10:36.342
- We're sitting ducks no matter where we are.
- Everybody calm the hell down, all right?

10:36.887 --> 10:38.252
(Nathan): Return to your posts.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.923
Double up on the entrances and exits,
and get those cameras online.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.219
- You heard him. Let's go.

10:45.813 --> 10:49.146
- If we don't get that Barn up soon,
we could have a mutiny on our hands.

10:49.274 --> 10:52.812
- If we don't figure out what happened to him
there might not be anyone left to mutiny.

10:52.945 --> 10:55.857
(squeaking)

10:55.989 --> 10:57.525
- Nathan?
- Parker!

11:01.328 --> 11:02.317
lt's stuck.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.237
- Nathan, the door won't open.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.126
(theme music)

11:43.287 --> 11:46.074
lt's stuck.
(Audrey): It's not, it's locked.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.367
- Well, unlock it.
- I can't.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.700
- The chair moved by itself.

11:51.837 --> 11:54.374
It was attacking Audrey.
Move back.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.087
- Thought we weren't gonna
jump to conclusions.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.252
Nathan?
Nathan!

11:58.385 --> 12:01.343
How many bones you think you've broken?
(Audrey): You know what? He's right.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.338
Stop, here,
get away from the door.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.975
(Nathan): All right, come on.

12:06.727 --> 12:07.842
Parker.

12:09.688 --> 12:10.723
- Ah!

12:12.316 --> 12:13.647
- Duke, wait!

12:13.775 --> 12:15.481
lt's bulletproof.
There's no point.

12:15.611 --> 12:17.772
(rumbling)

12:17.905 --> 12:19.315
Phase in there and get her.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.404
- I can only use a Trouble once.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.740
I already used it
going in the Void to get you.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.450
- Croatoan's trying to kill her.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.616
(rumbling)

12:31.126 --> 12:34.584
- Nathan, the security cameras...

12:34.922 --> 12:37.038
I thought you said
they weren't online yet.

12:37.174 --> 12:38.254
(Nathan): They're not.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.419
- Then why is the red light on?

12:42.012 --> 12:43.843
Wait, it just went out.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.007
- I think that's because ours just went on.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.346
- What?

12:50.938 --> 12:52.803
It's looking at us.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.438
- That's not creepy.

12:57.653 --> 13:00.736
- Mine's back.
(Nathan): Ours just went off.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.108
(phone ringing)

13:11.750 --> 13:13.786
(harsh '
ringin
-Oh! g)

13:20.258 --> 13:22.465
Is this a Trouble?
Could this be one of yours?

13:26.014 --> 13:28.505
(sighs)

13:28.976 --> 13:30.261
Wade.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.642
- One of your brother's victims?

13:34.314 --> 13:37.932
- He killed Roland Holloway's niece.
She was one of the bodies I found in the bay.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.899
- So it's not Croatoan.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.610
- It's a Holloway Trouble.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.115
The haunted house,

13:44.241 --> 13:47.574
where a building merges with a person.
It all fits...

13:47.703 --> 13:50.115
The crashing light,
the furniture all moving by itself.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.579
- Hiding dead bodies
where they're hard to find.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.619
(Nathan): So if you had this Trouble
when you exploded...

13:54.751 --> 13:57.128
(disconnected phone tone)
Who got it?

13:57.921 --> 14:00.037
(Duke): Yeah, and why are they
so pissed at us?

14:02.843 --> 14:04.424
(phone rings)

14:10.600 --> 14:13.057
- Are you trying to talk to me?
(phone rings)

14:14.438 --> 14:15.894
Is that one ring for "yes"?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.638
(phone rings)

14:17.774 --> 14:19.810
Okay, good.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.444
Who are you?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.611
Laverne?
(phone rings)

14:29.703 --> 14:31.989
lt's Laverne!
(Nathan): Our Laverne?

14:32.122 --> 14:34.829
- The radio lady?
- Her Trouble must have activated

14:34.958 --> 14:36.949
because of Croatoan
and the police station lockdown.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.995
- Well, that's good, right?
I mean, why would she want to hurt us?

14:41.131 --> 14:42.746
- Maybe you should ask Karl that.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.625
Sorry.
(Audrey): Did you kill Karl?

14:47.054 --> 14:50.091
Was it maybe an accident?
(phone rings)

14:50.223 --> 14:53.260
It's okay. I'm sure you didn't...
(phone rings)

14:53.393 --> 14:55.008
Wait, you didn't kill Karl?

14:55.145 --> 14:57.181
(phone rings twice)

14:57.314 --> 14:59.475
It wasn't Laverne.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.358
(Nathan): If it wasn't Laverne,
then who killed Karl?

15:04.488 --> 15:08.731
- Uh... I hate to agree
with our friend Alex, but...

15:10.327 --> 15:12.659
- Croatoan is inside the perimeter.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.007
Parker?

15:32.140 --> 15:33.095
Parker!

15:33.225 --> 15:35.557
Tell Laverne to let you out of there
right now.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.893
- Laverne, did you see who killed Karl?

15:39.022 --> 15:41.729
(phone rings twice)

15:41.858 --> 15:44.941
Okay, you didn't.
That's... that's fine, but...

15:46.029 --> 15:48.236
you saw the drops of blood
on the floor.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.071
(phone rings)

15:50.200 --> 15:53.738
And that's why you overloaded the light
and led us to his body.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.576
(phone rings)

15:55.705 --> 15:58.412
You did the right thing, okay?

15:59.709 --> 16:03.452
I'm sorry that this is happening to you,
but we've dealt with your Trouble before.

16:03.588 --> 16:06.751
We will be able to get you separated
from this building.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.293
(phone rings twice)

16:08.426 --> 16:10.382
You don't want to?
(Nathan): Parker.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.089
- Stop, listen.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.929
Just, I'm okay, all right?
She's trying to tell me something.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.556
- I don't like this.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.893
- Plan B?
- Go to the armory.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.577
- How are you doing that?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.541
(Nathan): Parker, tell Laverne to let me in
or I'm gonna blow this door.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.044
- Laverne, I think that maybe
you should let him in.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.755
That way, he doesn't hurt you.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.561
- What...
We have to get out of this station.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.851
Croatoan's inside,
and we can't see him coming.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.645
- Yes, we can.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.437
Look at what Laverne
has been showing me.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.615
- Most of these cameras aren't even
connected to the mainframe yet.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.785
- Maybe she doesn't need
to be connected to the mainframe.

17:19.331 --> 17:21.322
All the cameras
are connected to the building.

17:21.458 --> 17:25.042
Maybe she just needed to be linked
to the power grid.

17:25.462 --> 17:28.795
- Laverne just became the missing link
in our defense plan.

17:30.133 --> 17:33.000
- Maybe we can help her
extend her abilities,

17:33.470 --> 17:35.085
teach her some of Holloway's tricks.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.588
- Right, disappearing doors,
missing walls.

17:37.724 --> 17:38.759
That could come in handy.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.428
(phone rings)

17:40.560 --> 17:42.175
- Well, we'll get there.

17:42.312 --> 17:44.928
Listen, Laverne,
we're gonna need you

17:45.065 --> 17:48.273
to be our eyes and ears while we try
to figure out how to stop Croatoan.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.016
Can you meet us
in Dwight's office?

17:50.153 --> 17:51.814
(phone rings)

17:52.864 --> 17:55.276
She's on it.
- Come on.

18:11.716 --> 18:14.924
- Great, you made it.
(phone rings)

18:15.053 --> 18:17.419
All right, pull the camera feeds
through to this laptop.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.056
- Here, get to work.

18:19.182 --> 18:22.140
lf Croatoan really is inside the building,
we don't have much time.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.805
We got to get that Barn up now.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.394
- Maybe it was damaged
when the Barn crashed.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.184
- Yeah, or when it imploded.

18:28.525 --> 18:31.733
After I shot Howard,
it disintegrated in seconds.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.445
- Why have you brought me here?

18:44.124 --> 18:47.116
- Howard, you're alive.
- Apparently.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.958
- How...

18:50.922 --> 18:53.413
Did you just come out of the--
- What are you?

18:53.550 --> 18:56.132
- The controller.
(Audrey): For the Barn?

18:56.803 --> 18:59.010
- Yes, I am the controller
for the correctional facility

18:59.139 --> 19:02.222
created to rehabilitate Mara.
(Audrey): The Barn was destroyed.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.341
- I am keenly aware of that.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.762
lt disintegrated...

19:06.521 --> 19:07.852
when you shot me.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.018
- Howard, can you help us?

19:11.151 --> 19:13.016
Can you use this
to build a new Barn?

19:13.153 --> 19:14.768
(Nathan): One that won't take Audrey.

19:14.904 --> 19:18.192
- One that cures the Troubles forever,
not just for 27 years.

19:18.325 --> 19:22.318
- Yes, that core will supply the power,
but I can't build the Barn now.

19:22.454 --> 19:23.819
- Why?
We can go outside.

19:23.955 --> 19:26.822
- I can build a Barn anywhere
but not for you.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.619
- We don't have time for your games.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.660
Audrey's in danger.
Aren't you supposed to protect her?

19:31.796 --> 19:34.128
- The previous Barn
was designed to protect Mara.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.373
But to build a new one,
I need proper authorization.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.374
- I am giving you
the authorization.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.217
- You are Audrey Parker.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.180
You're an overlay personality.
I can't take orders from you.

19:43.933 --> 19:47.266
And... you shot me.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.096
- You've got to be kidding me.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.982
- We can't build a new Barn
without Howard.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.771
- Or kill Croatoan.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.278
He thinks you're still an overlay.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.817
- He doesn't know what Charlotte did.
- You have to tell him.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.909
Prove it to him somehow.
Get him back.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.700
(zapping)

20:08.792 --> 20:09.952
- What was that?

20:12.128 --> 20:13.208
(Nathan): Croatoan.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.933
(Audrey): Laverne,
I know you're still there.

20:29.062 --> 20:32.179
Even without power,
you have control of the building.

20:32.315 --> 20:33.896
Reach out.
Find a camera.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.357
Talk to me.
We need your eyes.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.272
(Alex): Did Croatoan
just blow out our power grid?

20:38.405 --> 20:39.611
(Nathan): It looks that way.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.900
(Alex): How are we supposed
to fight when we're blind?

20:42.033 --> 20:44.775
(Duke): Gotta get everything back online.
(Nathan): Hey, wait.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.785
You guys need me?
(Alex): No, no, we're good.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.121
- Someone's gotta stay with Audrey,
make sure Croatoan can't get to her,

20:50.250 --> 20:53.583
at least till we get our power back online.
- Bring the power up. I'll be here.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.544
- Come on, Alex. Maybe some of that hot air
can jump-start the generator.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.585
- Crocker, when this is over--
- We'll hug it out. Yeah, I know.

20:59.717 --> 21:02.299
(Nathan): Hey, we got
to make this area defensible.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.465
Bring everyone back to the Bullpen
and seal it up.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.258
No one gets in.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.347
Use your Troubles if you have to.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.444
- Now you listen to me,
Vincent Teagues.

21:25.577 --> 21:27.784
You are gonna stop
this ridiculous behavior

21:27.912 --> 21:30.745
and start grieving
your brother properly.

21:30.874 --> 21:32.284
- You sound just like him.

21:32.417 --> 21:36.080
- Well, all us old coots
start sounding alike after a while.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.918
(groans)

21:39.924 --> 21:42.711
Yeah, I know you miss him.
You should.

21:44.137 --> 21:47.300
I miss my son
every minute of every day.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.551
And don't think I didn't beat myself up
that I couldn't protect him.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.190
You know, when Ben died,

21:56.316 --> 21:58.272
l locked myself
in the morgue with baby Aaron,

21:58.401 --> 22:00.392
and I cried until I was hoarse.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.311
- Not how the Teagues operate.

22:03.448 --> 22:04.858
- Well, then it should be.

22:09.245 --> 22:13.614
Mourning Ben
honored the life that he gave up

22:13.750 --> 22:15.490
for the people he loved.

22:21.007 --> 22:25.000
So don't be a stoic old fool
and just let yourself grieve, huh?

22:25.929 --> 22:26.884
(knocking)

22:27.013 --> 22:29.299
- Nathan's ordered everybody back
to the Bullpen.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.798
We got to hurry.
(Gloria): Can you help me with...

22:31.935 --> 22:33.800
- Ooh.
- Are you okay?

22:33.937 --> 22:36.303
- Dizzy.
- Okay.

22:36.439 --> 22:37.770
Okay.

22:43.112 --> 22:45.319
(Nathan): What is taking so long?

22:45.448 --> 22:47.313
We should have heard
from Duke by now.

22:47.450 --> 22:50.487
(electronic beeping)

22:52.121 --> 22:53.076
- Laverne?

22:54.457 --> 22:55.537
(phone rings)

22:55.667 --> 22:57.703
Were you able to bypass
the power grid?

22:57.835 --> 22:58.995
(phone rings)

22:59.128 --> 23:02.871
Good, do you know how you did it?
(phone rings twice)

23:03.508 --> 23:06.545
Listen, the Holloway Trouble,
it taps into your instinct

23:06.678 --> 23:08.339
to protect the people
that you care about.

23:08.471 --> 23:09.881
Do you understand that?
(phone vibrates)

23:10.014 --> 23:11.845
(phone rings)

23:11.975 --> 23:13.590
- Duke, what's going on?

23:13.726 --> 23:15.102
Why is the generator not up?

23:15.228 --> 23:17.264
(Duke): It’s been gutted.
Now what?

23:18.356 --> 23:20.813
- You got to find another way
to get the lights back on.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.228
- How am I supposed to do that?

23:25.363 --> 23:27.524
- Laverne, listen,
I know you want to protect us.

23:27.657 --> 23:31.024
That's what you do.
That's what you've always done.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.402
It's why you've got this Trouble.
(phone rings)

23:34.539 --> 23:37.997
I need you to concentrate
on that protective instinct.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.867
Generate that feeling outwards.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.040
Try to power up
some of the other laptops.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.912
Do you think you can do that?

23:47.010 --> 23:48.295
(laptops beeping)

23:48.428 --> 23:50.635
- It's working.
She turned them on.

23:50.763 --> 23:51.798
- Okay, good.
- Nathan.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.048
- Stand by.
What else can she do?

23:55.685 --> 23:58.552
- Laverne, could you feel
the laptops coming on?

23:58.688 --> 24:00.303
(phone rings)

24:00.440 --> 24:02.681
Okay, good.

24:03.067 --> 24:06.104
All right, just keep
expanding that feeling.

24:06.237 --> 24:08.614
I want you to feel the building,
like it's...

24:08.740 --> 24:10.276
like it's your own skin.

24:10.408 --> 24:11.818
(phone rings)

24:11.951 --> 24:15.819
Okay, trace that feeling
through the electrical lines.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.456
Can you feel the disruption?

24:18.958 --> 24:21.540
(phone rings)
She's got it.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.421
Can you show us Duke?

24:27.800 --> 24:30.007
(Nathan): Okay, we’ve got the feed
from your phone.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.502
(Audrey): Laverne’s ﬁgured out
how to ﬁx the power outage.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.129
She’ll guide you to it.

24:34.265 --> 24:36.677
(zapping)

24:36.809 --> 24:38.891
- There's a light
at the end of the hall.

24:41.397 --> 24:42.853
(Duke shouts)

24:42.982 --> 24:45.098
(Nathan): Duke? Duke!

24:45.526 --> 24:47.107
- Laverne, do you know
what just happened?

24:47.236 --> 24:49.488
(phone rings twice)
She doesn't know.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.145
Okay.

24:52.283 --> 24:54.695
Hop in, all right?
Take us here.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.831
The light's blinking.

25:08.341 --> 25:09.797
Nathan.
- Hmm?

25:09.926 --> 25:12.087
- Laverne wants us
to go that way.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.338
Laverne?

25:19.602 --> 25:22.685
Will you please show us
where Duke's phone is?

25:29.320 --> 25:30.935
- Hey.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.656
The main power disconnect's
been tripped.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.401
We were right.
This was deliberate.

25:43.793 --> 25:45.454
- That's Duke's phone.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.430
Oh, my God.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.636
Croatoan's got Duke.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.352
- Laverne, have the security cameras
been recording

26:12.488 --> 26:14.695
since you took over the building?
(phone rings)

26:14.824 --> 26:16.780
Yes? Good.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.410
Can you review footage
in the background

26:18.536 --> 26:19.742
while you monitor
the current feeds?

26:19.871 --> 26:20.986
(phone rings)

26:21.122 --> 26:23.204
Okay, track through
all the footage you have.

26:23.332 --> 26:27.291
Find who or what flipped those breakers.
We need to know what we're dealing with.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.285
- There's no cameras
in the basement.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.002
- Track everyone that went
in or out of the basement today.

26:34.135 --> 26:35.875
(phone rings)

26:36.012 --> 26:38.594
- Laverne, find Duke.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.548
- Parker.
- Huh?

26:42.351 --> 26:43.557
- There was a lot of blood.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.392
- No, no.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.513
Howard, would you
get your ass out here?

26:48.649 --> 26:52.141
(zapping)

26:52.278 --> 26:54.690
- You do that on purpose, don't you?

26:54.822 --> 26:56.778
- I told you I cannot help you.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.407
- Why?
Because I'm an overlay?

27:00.536 --> 27:02.572
- Past your expiration date.

27:02.705 --> 27:04.696
At this point,
all my programming will let me do

27:04.832 --> 27:07.414
is initiate another cycle.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.367
- What does that mean?

27:09.504 --> 27:11.620
- Dispense a new overlay.

27:12.381 --> 27:13.666
- No.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.509
l'm Audrey Parker.
I'm staying Audrey Parker.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.298
- I cannot alter my programming.

27:19.430 --> 27:20.806
Only Mara's mother can do that.

27:20.932 --> 27:24.424
- Charlotte's dead.
- She was killed...

27:25.394 --> 27:26.895
by Croatoan.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.276
- Croatoan is here?

27:37.865 --> 27:39.150
- Yes.

27:40.284 --> 27:43.071
A lot has happened
since you were last in Haven.

27:43.871 --> 27:46.487
Croatoan killed my mother, Howard.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.790
- Charlotte was not your mother.
- Yes, she was.

27:49.919 --> 27:52.205
I'm not just an overlay.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.625
Mara was terminated,

27:56.425 --> 27:58.256
and Charlotte made me whole.

28:02.098 --> 28:03.634
- How can that be possible?

28:04.767 --> 28:06.974
Overlays were designed
to be temporary,

28:07.436 --> 28:10.519
a means to an end,
to help redeem Mara.

28:11.315 --> 28:13.522
- She realized that Mara
couldn't be redeemed.

28:13.651 --> 28:15.562
And she chose me because...

28:17.822 --> 28:20.154
because I was the daughter
that she always wanted.

28:24.328 --> 28:25.659
- In what way?

28:26.497 --> 28:28.362
- Charlotte saw in Audrey

28:28.499 --> 28:32.788
the compassion,
the selflessness

28:33.212 --> 28:35.874
that Mara was missing,
that Mara rejected.

28:36.007 --> 28:38.293
- Howard, do you see
all those people out there?

28:42.847 --> 28:45.805
If you don't build a new Barn
and send Croatoan back into the Void,

28:45.933 --> 28:47.309
they Will all be killed.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.846
Charlotte died to save them,

28:49.979 --> 28:52.937
and lam willing
to do the same thing.

28:53.065 --> 28:56.603
I'll do whatever it takes.
Just tell me.

29:02.992 --> 29:06.826
Please, what do l have to do
to convince you?

29:09.916 --> 29:11.497
- You already have.

29:13.836 --> 29:15.827
You are Charlotte's daughter.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.634
- And you'll do it?

29:21.636 --> 29:23.001
You'll build the Barn?

29:23.930 --> 29:27.138
- I will do everything in my power
to safeguard Charlotte's daughter

29:27.767 --> 29:30.099
and all those under her protection.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.192
(Audrey): Wait, wait.

29:41.364 --> 29:44.606
If you do this here, will it turn
the police station into the new Barn?

29:45.576 --> 29:48.033
Will that hurt Laverne?

29:48.496 --> 29:50.282
- The Barn will take
the shape of this building,

29:50.414 --> 29:52.621
but it will not be the building.

29:53.459 --> 29:54.995
Your Laverne will survive.

30:00.508 --> 30:03.591
(zapping)

30:06.514 --> 30:07.549
- What's happening?

30:09.016 --> 30:10.756
- I don't know.

30:12.436 --> 30:13.471
- Howard?

30:14.063 --> 30:15.052
Howard!

30:19.568 --> 30:22.059
- Who the hell is that?
- Long story.

30:23.239 --> 30:26.322
(zapping)

30:29.829 --> 30:31.239
- The aether core has been cracked...

30:32.957 --> 30:34.163
by corrosive elements.

30:34.291 --> 30:37.749
lts stability is compromised.

30:41.090 --> 30:43.877
- Did the core...
Did it damage you?

30:44.635 --> 30:45.841
- Yes.

30:46.262 --> 30:48.378
- How did Croatoan do this?
How do we fix it?

30:48.514 --> 30:49.549
- Croatoan...

30:49.682 --> 30:51.718
(zapping)
...did...

30:52.518 --> 30:54.133
not do this.

30:54.270 --> 30:57.762
Croatoan isn't...
(zapping)

30:57.898 --> 30:59.729
...in the station.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.898
- Did we just lose the Barn?

31:09.035 --> 31:13.278
- lf Croatoan isn't here,
then who did this to Howard?

31:14.373 --> 31:16.750
(laptop beeping)

31:18.419 --> 31:20.205
Laverne, is this you?

31:25.259 --> 31:27.500
Duke, he's okay.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.297
- No, that's from before,

31:29.930 --> 31:31.670
right after we were
on perimeter check.

31:31.807 --> 31:34.640
He got a text.
He had to go make a call.

31:34.769 --> 31:36.851
- Laverne, did you find this
in your archives?

31:36.979 --> 31:38.640
Why are you showing us Duke?

31:38.773 --> 31:41.810
(rumbling)

31:50.659 --> 31:52.991
- What the hell
just happened to him?

31:54.497 --> 31:57.455
- Laverne, is this
a glitch in your playback?

31:57.583 --> 31:59.790
(phone rings twice)

32:13.432 --> 32:15.969
(grunts)

32:16.102 --> 32:20.311
- He lied about not being able to use
his Trouble more than once.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.351
- Aw, kid, what else
have you been lying about?

32:23.484 --> 32:26.317
- The aether core was damaged
by something corrosive.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.856
Acid.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.864
- Karl's Trouble.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.951
- This whole time we thought
that Croatoan was after me,

32:36.622 --> 32:39.739
but it's Duke
that's been doing all of this.

32:39.875 --> 32:42.537
Croatoan must be
controlling him somehow.

32:42.878 --> 32:46.712
- That's why Karl's throat was slit.
Duke needed the blood to absorb his Trouble.

32:46.841 --> 32:48.547
- To destroy the aether core.

32:49.051 --> 32:50.712
- For Croatoan.

32:55.391 --> 32:56.927
- This can't be happening.

32:57.059 --> 32:58.515
- He can phase.

32:59.562 --> 33:01.393
He's got acid touch.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.976
If Duke killed Alex,

33:05.401 --> 33:06.982
he could have
the freezing Trouble too.

33:12.533 --> 33:13.989
Duke.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.741
(Duke grunting)

33:28.841 --> 33:30.251
Parker, get out of here.

33:30.384 --> 33:31.464
Go, go.

33:33.012 --> 33:34.127
(door slamming)

33:34.263 --> 33:36.003
(pounding)

33:41.896 --> 33:43.557
(pounding)

33:57.828 --> 34:00.444
(singsong): Audrey.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.287
Come out...

34:03.209 --> 34:05.074
Come out...

34:07.004 --> 34:09.495
Wherever you are.

34:13.844 --> 34:16.881
It is awfully crowded in here.

34:18.849 --> 34:21.556
So little personal space.

34:23.062 --> 34:27.396
And I do love my personal space.

34:29.610 --> 34:33.774
You are in so much Trouble.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.484
- Laverne, you have to let me out of here.

34:38.661 --> 34:41.403
Look, I know that you think
that this is for my own good.

34:42.665 --> 34:44.701
That is not Duke out there.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.961
Croatoan is somehow
controlling him.

34:51.674 --> 34:54.040
You need to let me talk to him.

34:54.176 --> 34:56.337
I need to do this face-to-face.

34:57.346 --> 35:00.053
(Duke, singsong): Audrey.

35:00.182 --> 35:04.391
Why are you so stubborn?

35:05.437 --> 35:08.099
That's probably a stupid question.

35:08.232 --> 35:11.941
That... is just you.

35:12.945 --> 35:14.105
Stubborn...

35:15.447 --> 35:17.108
and manipulative...

35:19.034 --> 35:21.025
and frigid.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.487
No wonder you picked him.

35:28.127 --> 35:29.116
Now...

35:30.379 --> 35:33.712
Mara, on the other hand,

35:34.883 --> 35:38.011
was a real beast in the sheets.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.753
I could tell you stories.

35:45.728 --> 35:46.968
Oops.

35:49.773 --> 35:54.142
- Laverne, we can't let him
keep killing more people.

35:54.278 --> 35:58.612
You have to let me go and talk to him.
I can't do it from here.

36:04.621 --> 36:07.749
Laverne, all of those people out there,
we have to protect them.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.123
We won't be able
to live with ourselves

36:10.252 --> 36:13.540
if another one dies
and we were able to stop it.

36:20.179 --> 36:21.544
Thank you.

36:24.892 --> 36:28.384
So you can use your Trouble
more than once after all.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.056
- Yes.

36:30.189 --> 36:32.054
But I needed time.

36:32.691 --> 36:36.775
Couldn't let you build the Barn
before I fixed the aether core.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.399
- Why are you doing this?

36:39.531 --> 36:42.238
- I think you know why I'm doing this.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.155
I'm doing what I was born to do,

36:45.662 --> 36:49.200
what my family was created to do.

36:49.333 --> 36:51.415
- You've fought this
ever since you found out

36:51.543 --> 36:53.374
about the Crocker family curse.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.505
- Things change.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.255
Dreams die.

36:58.384 --> 36:59.920
- They don't have to.

37:00.052 --> 37:02.464
You are not this person, Duke.

37:02.596 --> 37:04.632
Remember why you came back,

37:04.765 --> 37:07.677
why you came to Haven,
to save it.

37:07.810 --> 37:11.052
- You can't use your magic on me.

37:12.648 --> 37:15.981
I am a Crocker.

37:16.777 --> 37:21.316
In fact, I'm all Crocker now.

37:21.448 --> 37:25.361
And there's nothing
you can do to change that.

37:25.494 --> 37:27.530
- What would Jennifer think?

37:27.663 --> 37:30.450
What would she think
if she saw you like this?

37:30.582 --> 37:33.824
- Well, she was so easy to manipulate.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.669
I could distract her
with a simple game,

37:37.798 --> 37:40.915
like pooh sticks.

37:42.469 --> 37:44.630
Or how about...

37:46.473 --> 37:47.849
eeny”.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.635
meeny...

37:50.727 --> 37:52.308
miny...

37:55.357 --> 37:56.563
mo?

38:07.536 --> 38:10.699
Did you really think
I would let you shoot me?

38:16.044 --> 38:17.659
Come and get me.

38:19.131 --> 38:23.249
Or are you afraid
that you might hurt your friends?

38:25.095 --> 38:27.086
I have what I want.

38:28.432 --> 38:30.548
You can keep the rest of them.

38:47.534 --> 38:48.990
- Audrey's gone.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.069
Check the station.
(man): Audrey!

38:53.916 --> 38:55.156
(man): Audrey?

39:14.520 --> 39:15.930
- He took her.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.431
We're gonna get her back.

39:21.860 --> 39:25.523
And when we do, we're gonna get you
out of this building, Laverne. You hear me?

39:26.657 --> 39:28.193
Don't give up.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.538
- You go find Audrey.
We'll handle this.

39:40.462 --> 39:44.375
- Croatoan always seems
ten steps ahead of us.

39:45.384 --> 39:49.002
First Dave, now Audrey.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.126
Duke...

39:51.306 --> 39:54.218
- That wasn't Duke.
That was not the kid I know.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.675
- We've lost so many.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.974
Who'd have thought
we'd be the ones still standing?

40:00.482 --> 40:02.564
Last of the old coots.

40:04.403 --> 40:05.939
And you better not
go anywhere,

40:06.071 --> 40:09.859
because I can't be responsible
for honoring you too.

40:28.051 --> 40:29.427
- Mine.

40:31.179 --> 40:35.092
Just... like you.

40:37.519 --> 40:38.554
- Duke?

40:40.022 --> 40:43.355
Whatever happened to you,
whatever Croatoan did to you,

40:43.859 --> 40:45.190
we can fix it.

40:46.194 --> 40:49.857
- What makes you think
that I want to be fixed?

40:49.990 --> 40:52.231
I am a Crocker,

40:52.367 --> 40:55.825
and Crockers
were made to kill.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.239
- But you can stop.

40:59.541 --> 41:02.749
- I don't want to stop.

41:02.878 --> 41:04.459
Don't you see?

41:05.464 --> 41:09.082
For the first time,
I have chosen my destiny.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.959
And it feels good.

41:12.095 --> 41:15.303
- Duke, let me go.

41:15.432 --> 41:18.344
- I don't take orders
from you anymore.

41:18.477 --> 41:23.938
And I'm finally taking orders
from the person I was always meant to.

41:30.572 --> 41:32.563
- Croatoan.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.402
- Call me Dad.

42:04.231 --> 42:07.098
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
