- They're coming.
- They're right behind us!

01:00.100 --> 01:01.465
Watch out!

01:01.467 --> 01:02.733
Right behind us!

01:04.705 --> 01:06.905
- Watch out!
- Miguel!

01:12.145 --> 01:16.883
<i>It don't look it, but it was the
best day and the worst day of our lives.</i>

01:23.490 --> 01:26.794
<i>Fifty thousand tourists
visit Washington DC every day.</i>

01:32.065 --> 01:33.601
<i>But my part of the city...</i>

01:35.169 --> 01:36.537
<i>they never see.</i>

01:38.705 --> 01:41.509
<i>I can ride my bike to the White
House and make it in 20 minutes,</i>

01:41.909 --> 01:44.511
<i>but here,
the gangs run the streets.</i>

01:46.746 --> 01:51.651
<i>And I work for the biggest gang
around: Mara Salvatrucha, the MS-13.</i>

01:52.052 --> 01:54.689
<i>I always dreamed to be the
next Derek Jeter or Cabrera.</i>

01:54.887 --> 01:57.991
<i>But in my neighborhood,
drugs come before baseball.</i>

01:59.927 --> 02:02.661
<i>Everywhere you go, you see
the blue colors and the ink.</i>

02:02.663 --> 02:05.166
<i>Rape, control, kill.
That's like their motto.</i>

02:05.799 --> 02:09.068
<i>Our clique, The Coronado Locos,
ran the taxis, the hookers, the drugs</i>

02:09.502 --> 02:11.706
<i>from University Boulevard
to the train tracks.</i>

02:12.473 --> 02:14.409
<i>If it was in the neighborhood,
they owned it.</i>

02:14.908 --> 02:17.675
<i>The system was so jenked,
you got bagged anywhere in DC,</i>

02:17.677 --> 02:19.543
<i>you had to be processed
in Federal.</i>

02:19.545 --> 02:22.416
<i>So most of the time,
the</i> chota <i>never even bothered.</i>

02:24.818 --> 02:28.686
<i>And the gangs, they'd grown even bigger
than before 'cause no one talks to the cop.</i>

02:28.688 --> 02:30.655
<i>Not 'cause they're loyal,</i>

02:30.657 --> 02:32.559
<i>but because everybody's scared
shitless now of getting deported.</i>

02:32.825 --> 02:35.560
<i>Ten thousand gang members
in over 40 states.</i>

02:38.731 --> 02:40.100
<i>And these ugly</i> maras...

02:40.766 --> 02:42.766
<i>even though they're locked up
in El Salvador,</i>

02:42.768 --> 02:45.573
<i>they call the shots in every
clique from New York to LA.</i>

02:48.107 --> 02:49.240
<i>They have the drug boys...</i>

02:50.910 --> 02:52.879
<i>...the drug boys
answer to the collectors...</i>

02:54.781 --> 02:56.884
<i>the collectors
answer to the soldiers...</i>

02:58.184 --> 02:59.886
<i>the soldiers answer to Jester.</i>

03:00.653 --> 03:02.554
<i>He was one dumb-ass homey,</i>

03:02.556 --> 03:04.823
<i>but was also the</i> segunda
palabra, <i>second word.</i>

03:04.825 --> 03:07.994
<i>Everyone had to go through him to
get to the boss, except for me.</i>

03:08.594 --> 03:09.764
<i>That's why he hates me.</i>

03:09.962 --> 03:11.865
<i>And at
the top of the food chain...</i>

03:15.301 --> 03:16.601
<i>Rincon.</i>

03:20.807 --> 03:22.944
<i>Rincon was
the most feared badass in DC.</i>

03:23.277 --> 03:27.148
<i>He became</i> prima palabra <i>when he was
19, first word, out of the clique</i>

03:27.713 --> 03:29.747
<i>'cause he offed all the
other crews and dealers</i>

03:29.749 --> 03:32.486
<i>and any snake who ever thought
of flippin' or ratting out.</i>

03:33.619 --> 03:34.754
"I...

03:36.056 --> 03:36.991
am a Jew.

03:38.624 --> 03:39.823
Hath not a Jew eyes?"

03:39.825 --> 03:43.027
Please, Rincon. Please, please.

03:43.029 --> 03:44.765
"And organs...

03:46.033 --> 03:47.232
affections..."

03:47.234 --> 03:49.300
<i>When Rincon
started doing his Shakespeare,</i>

03:49.302 --> 03:52.005
<i>you knew some poor bastard's
about to get smoked.</i>

03:53.172 --> 03:54.775
"If you prick us...

03:56.075 --> 03:57.077
do we not bleed?"

03:57.611 --> 03:58.412
Please.

03:58.879 --> 04:02.283
"If you tickle us,
will we not laugh?

04:02.950 --> 04:06.016
If you poison us,
do we not die?"

04:06.018 --> 04:08.720
He fuckin' switched the hub.
He had me.

04:08.722 --> 04:09.920
"And if you wrong us..."

04:09.922 --> 04:11.791
You know
I would never betray you.

04:14.194 --> 04:16.127
"...shall we not take revenge?"

04:23.169 --> 04:25.604
No, no. No.

04:52.366 --> 04:54.765
<i>See, lots of junkies
come here looking for their fix.</i>

04:54.767 --> 04:57.736
<i>Smack, meth, scoobies, pac-man,
you name it.</i>

04:57.738 --> 04:58.940
<i>But of all my buyers...</i>

05:00.640 --> 05:01.808
<i>Daniel was different.</i>

05:04.243 --> 05:06.113
<i>I never got
what brought him here.</i>

05:19.392 --> 05:20.727
What's up, Daniel?

05:21.395 --> 05:23.197
I read it. It was pretty good.

05:27.366 --> 05:30.871
Okay, fine, I didn't read it, but...
I don't have time for reading.

05:35.976 --> 05:36.944
Fine.

05:42.282 --> 05:44.715
<i>Kid
your age should be in school,</i>

05:44.717 --> 05:46.383
<i>not running for the clique.</i>

05:46.385 --> 05:47.688
Yeah, whatever.

05:55.762 --> 05:58.065
Easy, Daniel.
That shit's gonna kill you.

05:59.765 --> 06:00.867
See you around.

06:02.034 --> 06:04.768
Hey, Daniel.
You got some for me?

06:04.770 --> 06:06.071
Fuckin' doctors, man.

06:06.073 --> 06:08.172
Say I lost my benefits.
Say I was drug seeking.

06:08.174 --> 06:11.177
Man, G. God bless you, brother.
God bless you.

06:20.053 --> 06:21.986
Yo, Lucas.
Friend to the street.

06:21.988 --> 06:24.354
Nah, nah, nah.
But soon to be king, though, right?

06:24.356 --> 06:25.823
Yo, check it out.

06:34.267 --> 06:35.999
- Oh, dope, man.
- Come on.

06:36.001 --> 06:37.170
- I like that shit.
- Lucas!

06:38.938 --> 06:41.172
Yo, Lucas. You need any help
with your collects?

06:42.508 --> 06:44.943
Any <i>jotos</i> giving you shit?
I hope you drop them bitches.

06:44.945 --> 06:46.477
No, man. I'm good, Rodrigo.

06:46.479 --> 06:50.013
No psych, Lucas. I'm gangsta.
Waiting for my initiation.

06:50.015 --> 06:52.950
Gonna get jumped in.
Give me a cop. Bam.

06:52.952 --> 06:56.054
Little <i>gordito</i> is gangsta, all right.
Wants to be in the gang, huh?

06:56.056 --> 06:58.088
- Hey, give it back.
- Listen, boy.

06:58.090 --> 07:00.424
You don't have to shoot no cop.
I mean, you could just eat him, right?

07:00.426 --> 07:01.493
Give it back!

07:01.495 --> 07:02.861
See you, guys.

07:02.863 --> 07:03.828
You want some?

07:03.830 --> 07:05.196
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:05.198 --> 07:07.131
- Oh, shit! Fuck. Fuck.

07:07.133 --> 07:08.468

- Yo, chill. Chill, chill, chill.

07:08.969 --> 07:10.335
- You want some?
- Whoa, whoa. It's cool, man!

07:10.337 --> 07:12.070
- Calm down, man.
- Get the fuck out of here.

07:12.072 --> 07:14.405
- You want some?
- No, just fuckin' with you.

07:14.407 --> 07:16.243
Yo, Lucas! I'm gangsta!

07:55.015 --> 07:56.282
You ready for tonight?

07:59.952 --> 08:01.888
I wish they was here.

08:22.909 --> 08:24.044
All right?

08:25.544 --> 08:27.948
Mama will be just as proud
as I am.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.163
Lucas.

08:42.495 --> 08:43.229
I'm sorry.

08:44.164 --> 08:46.431
My wife, she's sick
from the chemo.

08:46.433 --> 08:49.102
I have to close the store
for a few days.

08:50.470 --> 08:52.170
I will pay next week.

08:52.172 --> 08:54.975
Tell him...
tell him I'm sorry.

08:56.443 --> 08:58.412
Here. For you and your brother.

08:59.178 --> 09:01.345
I'll cover for you
this time, Carlos.

09:01.347 --> 09:02.982
But you better have it
next week.

09:04.016 --> 09:07.087
- This better be the last time, okay?
- Thank you, Lucas.

09:08.087 --> 09:09.423
You're a good kid.

09:10.624 --> 09:11.592
Tell him...

09:12.225 --> 09:13.894
Tell him I pay next week.

09:19.432 --> 09:20.366
Hi.

09:25.572 --> 09:26.604
Sit down.

09:26.606 --> 09:27.508
- It's okay?
- Yeah.

09:28.107 --> 09:31.209
Brenda, café.
You want a cup?

09:31.211 --> 09:33.414
Uh, no, no.
I'm fine. Thank you.

09:42.422 --> 09:46.160
Your cousin tell me
you are having the...

09:47.459 --> 09:48.995
the ceremony here?

09:50.529 --> 09:51.899
Is that a problem?

09:52.966 --> 09:57.137
Well, a Catholic wedding
must take place in a church.

10:09.281 --> 10:11.484
I know you
since you are a little kid.

10:12.217 --> 10:16.122
I know what you've been through.
We come from the same place.

10:17.656 --> 10:21.526
I've seen you growing up.
I know how much you love your sister.

10:21.528 --> 10:26.033
She should start a new life
in the house of God.

10:28.034 --> 10:30.203
Padre, I respect you.

10:32.237 --> 10:36.376
But nobody tells me
what to do with my sister.

10:36.675 --> 10:38.276
I'll see you in the evening.

10:38.278 --> 10:39.580
- But, Rincon...
- That's it.

10:41.048 --> 10:44.315
...admissions program. The army can
provide you with 100% tuition assistance

10:44.317 --> 10:47.221
to take college classes
even while you're serving.

10:55.761 --> 10:57.196
Hey, what's up?

11:01.367 --> 11:02.335
What's up?

11:07.473 --> 11:08.507
Hey, Lucas.

11:08.509 --> 11:10.441
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you at school?

11:10.443 --> 11:11.375
I'm workin'.

11:11.377 --> 11:13.043
Get outta here.
I gotta meet the drug boys.

11:13.045 --> 11:14.280
Yeah, you're meeting me.

11:15.781 --> 11:18.284
Really. You're meeting me. I'm the
new drug boy, man. I got the benches.

11:18.617 --> 11:20.987
You're supposed to
give the stash over to me.

11:21.621 --> 11:22.555
- What?
- Yeah.

11:23.188 --> 11:24.457
I'm the new drug boy.
I just started today.

11:25.257 --> 11:27.325
You're not selling.
Get your ass to school.

11:27.327 --> 11:29.127
Fuck school, dude!
I'm gonna work for Rincon.

11:29.129 --> 11:31.796
- You're not working for Rincon.
- Hey. Listen, I'm setting up.

11:31.798 --> 11:33.630
Soon, I'm gonna be
a runner like you.

11:33.632 --> 11:36.133
You're not like me and you're
not gonna sell. Come on, man!

11:36.135 --> 11:38.168
- This is bullshit!
- I gotta take care of your ass, too?

11:38.170 --> 11:39.771
I don't wanna see you
back here again.

11:39.773 --> 11:42.076
- If I do, I'm gonna kick your ass.
- I'm gonna be a runner!

11:43.643 --> 11:46.610
Yo, Daniel, my brother, my man.
Got a five? Got a ten?

11:46.612 --> 11:49.513
I'm not coppin' no more, man.
I'm strictly buyin' food.

11:49.515 --> 11:52.383
Takin' care of myself.
Got me on a meat diet.

11:52.385 --> 11:54.317
Cuttin' out bread, sugar
and all that shit.

11:54.319 --> 11:56.521
'Cause, man, them carbs,
that's the shit that's gonna kill you.

11:56.523 --> 11:59.389
They call it a primal diet.
Primal like a caveman.

11:59.391 --> 12:01.091
You know how them
vegetarians don't eat meat

12:01.093 --> 12:02.393
'cause how it's killin'
all the animals

12:02.395 --> 12:03.661
and they feel all bad
for the animals.

12:03.663 --> 12:05.662
But you know what scientists
are sayin' now?

12:05.664 --> 12:10.270
They sayin' vegetables...
Vegetables, man, they also got feelings.

12:10.602 --> 12:13.403
Like a lettuce or a tomato
know that you eatin' 'em.

12:13.405 --> 12:15.239
Straight up.
Heard this shit on NPR.

12:15.241 --> 12:17.207
Said they done studies
on this shit.

12:17.209 --> 12:20.046
Like, if you eat a cabbage,
that cabbage, it knows you eatin' it,

12:20.513 --> 12:21.778
and it feels pain.

12:24.217 --> 12:27.020
Believe that shit? Cabbage.
It got feelings, too.

12:27.654 --> 12:30.153
So what are vegetarians
gonna eat now, huh? Rocks?

12:30.155 --> 12:32.156
Man, they don't understand,

12:32.158 --> 12:34.492
but in this world one man gonna
survive, another man gonna get hurt.

12:34.494 --> 12:37.164
That's the way it is.
That's the way it's always been.

12:46.172 --> 12:47.307
God bless you.

12:48.308 --> 12:50.110
<i>Semper Fi,</i> my brother.

12:51.177 --> 12:52.413
<i>Semper Fi.</i>

12:53.880 --> 12:58.217
Finally, Abraham Lincoln granted
freedom to all slaves in what year?

13:01.453 --> 13:02.322
Anyone?

13:02.889 --> 13:04.422
If I ever see you back there...

13:04.424 --> 13:05.856
Fuck school, dude!
I'm getting in with the gang!

13:05.858 --> 13:07.325
Sit down!

13:07.327 --> 13:08.558
I'm gonna get jumped in!

13:08.560 --> 13:10.663
No, you're not!
Not on my watch!

13:11.231 --> 13:13.467
I want what's best for you.
Can't you think?

13:14.199 --> 13:17.203
I'm pickin' you up at 3:00 and I'm
takin' you straight to practice.

13:19.539 --> 13:21.207
Don't let him leave.

13:25.211 --> 13:26.447
Okay, kids.

13:28.414 --> 13:32.282
Abraham Lincoln initiated
the Emancipation Proclamation

13:32.284 --> 13:34.284
so that slaves could be free.

13:34.286 --> 13:35.721
What does that mean for you?

13:36.489 --> 13:38.692
How could this affect
your lives?

13:39.358 --> 13:40.660
Daniel, Daniel.

13:44.297 --> 13:45.599
I thought
you said you quit.

13:48.233 --> 13:50.369
That's the same thing
you said last time.

13:52.871 --> 13:56.110
Are there no ratty body shops
where you're from?

14:00.380 --> 14:03.380
No, it's not that I don't like
having you here. I do. It's...

14:05.184 --> 14:06.652
Stop it.

14:07.386 --> 14:10.654
I'm just asking, you know,
'cause normally, it's the Latinos

14:10.656 --> 14:13.259
looking for jobs
in the white neighborhoods.

14:22.401 --> 14:24.904
<i>I guess
I just like the people here.</i>

14:25.672 --> 14:28.638
Felix, hey, put that more in the
middle, right there.

14:31.276 --> 14:32.512
That's good.

14:37.283 --> 14:38.685
Tomas, huh.

14:39.952 --> 14:42.255
You look good.

14:48.928 --> 14:50.293
This is my family.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.170
I'm taking Maria
to the "Y" after school.

14:57.971 --> 14:59.373
Meet you by the creek?

15:08.548 --> 15:10.616
- Take a seat.
- Please, please.

15:32.572 --> 15:34.474
You want breakfast burrito?

15:51.491 --> 15:52.425
Hey.

15:52.924 --> 15:54.660
5.50. Hey.

15:56.928 --> 15:58.398
5.50.

16:00.732 --> 16:02.768
Fifty cent, man.
Fifty cent more.

16:03.435 --> 16:06.604
- Come on, <i>chavala,</i> get movin'.
- Ain't no pills here, white boy.

16:06.606 --> 16:08.372
- Fifty cent more, man.
- It's a food truck.

16:08.374 --> 16:10.310
Come on, <i>chavala,</i> get movin'.

16:10.643 --> 16:13.043
Move your ass.
Boys gotta get back to work.

16:13.045 --> 16:15.912
Yeah, get movin', <i>chavala.</i>

16:15.914 --> 16:17.380
Hey, fuckin' junkie.

16:17.382 --> 16:18.682
What? Hey?

16:18.684 --> 16:20.317
You wanna fuck me or something?

16:20.319 --> 16:22.320
Ooh, he givin' you
a bitch stare.

16:22.322 --> 16:24.088
You don't talk much,
do you, <i>chavala?</i>

16:24.090 --> 16:26.326
Wanna get
fuckin' ball-deep or what?

16:27.659 --> 16:29.630
Ooh, that's what I thought.

16:32.597 --> 16:34.400
What you gonna do,
punk-ass? Huh?

16:34.967 --> 16:36.903
You wanna fuck with us?

16:37.569 --> 16:41.474
- What you gonna do about it, <i>chavala?</i>
- Huh?

16:42.475 --> 16:43.744
What you gonna do, huh?

16:45.010 --> 16:47.077
- What you gonna do, huh? Huh?
- What you gonna do, punk-ass?

16:47.079 --> 16:49.382
Old man river.

16:49.615 --> 16:52.351
Yeah, that's right.
Keep walking, junkie.

17:00.693 --> 17:01.827
You, uh...

17:04.964 --> 17:07.367
You ready for the big day?

17:08.434 --> 17:09.502
Yeah.

17:10.903 --> 17:14.972
I hear you're finishing up at
Montgomery College this year, right?

17:14.973 --> 17:15.976
Right.

17:16.376 --> 17:17.611
Right, I'm...

17:18.978 --> 17:20.211
I'm getting my associate's degree
in construction management.

17:20.213 --> 17:24.017
My brother's waiting for them in Orlando.
Got a job for him.

17:24.784 --> 17:27.454
Prepared a room in his house
and everything.

17:29.021 --> 17:30.890
Good. Good.

17:31.623 --> 17:32.858
Gabriela's excited.

17:33.726 --> 17:34.695
Me, too.

17:36.027 --> 17:38.564
She hasn't
been outside of DC in...

17:39.732 --> 17:40.634
years.

17:41.566 --> 17:43.134
She's going to love Florida.

17:43.136 --> 17:46.873
It's beautiful.
Beautiful people, beautiful food.

17:47.407 --> 17:48.805
Disneyland.

17:48.807 --> 17:49.607
Disney World.

19:27.707 --> 19:29.443
Hello, darling.

19:31.843 --> 19:34.581
No, yours is good,
it's good.

19:35.648 --> 19:38.485
Yes, I think you should.
Absolutely.

19:38.985 --> 19:40.020
Lucas.

19:40.620 --> 19:41.985
Look at the bride.

19:43.523 --> 19:44.988
You look great.

19:44.990 --> 19:46.657
- What do you think of my hair?
- Like Jessica Alba.

19:46.659 --> 19:49.059
- Yeah?
- Way prettier than Jessica Alba.

19:49.061 --> 19:50.860
Come on. Let's go.

19:50.862 --> 19:52.862
We gotta get dressed before
the photographer gets here.

19:52.864 --> 19:55.734
Right.

20:06.579 --> 20:08.012
- Sorry.
- Lucas.

20:08.014 --> 20:09.015
Come here.

20:09.614 --> 20:11.083
You know Tomas and his family.

20:13.819 --> 20:17.053
If you'll excuse me,
I have business to talk with Lucas.

20:24.030 --> 20:24.965
The wedding, huh?

20:25.564 --> 20:26.900
Fuckin' mess, man.

20:29.735 --> 20:31.301
Hey, you hungry?
You want something to eat?

20:31.303 --> 20:32.906
No, I'm good.

20:36.207 --> 20:37.878
What's up your ass?

20:39.644 --> 20:41.311
Look, I wanna ask you
about some things.

20:41.313 --> 20:44.314
Oh, shit. I forgot.
I got you something.

20:44.316 --> 20:45.784
- Brenda?
- What?

20:46.052 --> 20:48.319
Hey, Brenda,
bring in the suit!

20:48.321 --> 20:49.622
What?

20:50.823 --> 20:53.226
- Bring in Lucas's suit!
- What?

20:53.726 --> 20:55.861
Lucas's suit! Bring the suit!

21:02.200 --> 21:03.135
That's for you.

21:03.969 --> 21:04.938
Stand up.

21:05.604 --> 21:06.936
- You like it?
- Yeah, I love it.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.139
- Thank you.
- I want you wearing that for the wedding.

21:10.141 --> 21:12.312
I want you to sit right
in front with the <i>familia.</i>

21:12.745 --> 21:14.344
Never worn a suit before.

21:14.346 --> 21:15.713
It's perfect.

21:15.715 --> 21:16.949
- Okay?
- Yeah.

21:21.687 --> 21:22.988
How was the run?

21:23.322 --> 21:24.388
Huh?

21:24.390 --> 21:25.691
The run.

21:26.124 --> 21:28.958
Oh. Yeah. It was good.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.063
Look, Rincon,
I wanna ask you about something.

21:31.697 --> 21:34.665
I wanna ask you about Miguel.
I don't want him having this kind of life.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.667
I don't want him
to be a part of the gang.

21:36.669 --> 21:39.139
- He's been getting so good at baseball...
- What are you talking about?

21:39.639 --> 21:41.808
Miguel. He can get out of here.

21:42.341 --> 21:43.706
He has a shot...

21:43.708 --> 21:45.745
Please, man, I'm...

21:46.411 --> 21:50.680
- He says he still don't got it.
- I'm sorry, man. I'm your boy, really.

21:52.017 --> 21:53.850
I'll get it, buddy,
I promise. I promise.

21:53.852 --> 21:56.919
Hey, after three fuckin' times,
I ain't your fuckin' buddy.

21:56.921 --> 21:58.158
Argh!

21:59.458 --> 22:00.791
- You got that shit?
- This is the last time, man.

22:00.793 --> 22:02.128
This is the last time...

22:02.727 --> 22:04.698
Do your fuckin' job.

22:05.765 --> 22:08.098
Jester. Jester.
Take care of this.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.136
I'm trying to discuss
business with Lucas.

22:10.736 --> 22:11.901
Okay?

22:11.903 --> 22:13.138
Yo, please, man.

22:14.206 --> 22:15.708
No, man. No! Argh!

22:16.976 --> 22:20.146
Please, man. Please! Hey, man, it's me!
I'm your boy, man!

22:29.755 --> 22:31.624
- What the hell is this?
- Oh...

22:32.091 --> 22:33.890
Carlos said he couldn't pay.
His wife's sick.

22:33.892 --> 22:35.694
But he promised
he would pay next time.

22:37.028 --> 22:39.163
Didn't I talk to you
about this before?

22:39.165 --> 22:41.134
He promised
this was the last time.

22:45.204 --> 22:46.139
You know...

22:48.306 --> 22:51.644
you got too much
of your older brother in you.

22:52.410 --> 22:55.015
He was smart, but soft.

22:55.448 --> 22:59.252
He got his ass killed on the other side of
the world thinking he was helping you out.

23:01.187 --> 23:04.658
People have to fear you.

23:07.826 --> 23:09.228
Your heart...

23:10.896 --> 23:12.132
like stone.

23:14.934 --> 23:16.936
- Understand?
- Yeah.

23:19.938 --> 23:21.905
Paco, tell Jester
to keep it down.

23:21.907 --> 23:24.077
I got my sister getting ready
in the other room.

23:30.181 --> 23:32.986
You know, I felt sorry for
them, too, when I was your age.

23:34.853 --> 23:37.189
I came here alone
with nothing.

23:39.492 --> 23:40.393
Younger than you.

23:41.393 --> 23:44.163
My father and brothers
killed in El Salvador,

23:44.764 --> 23:47.233
my mother raped and murdered
by the <i>coyotes,</i>

23:47.967 --> 23:50.236
leaving me to take care
of my little baby sis

23:50.969 --> 23:54.106
born with a disability,
the way she is.

23:55.874 --> 23:57.974
Had to do
what needed to be done.

23:57.976 --> 23:59.245
Know what I'm sayin'?

24:01.380 --> 24:02.648
Just like with your father.

24:05.517 --> 24:09.389
Fuckin' MAGAs wanna come in here
and take control of my own barrio?

24:10.288 --> 24:13.055
The Bloods, the cops,
the <i>federales,</i> whatever.

24:13.057 --> 24:16.729
You gotta be ready to do
what your enemy is not.

24:20.932 --> 24:22.167
You know...

24:23.302 --> 24:25.938
I wasn't always
the biggest dealer in DC.

24:28.807 --> 24:30.743
But I was the one
who killed them.

24:33.012 --> 24:35.545
I'm gonna send Mousey
over to Carlos tomorrow.

24:35.547 --> 24:37.214
No, man,
you don't gotta do that.

24:37.216 --> 24:38.349
Why?

24:38.351 --> 24:40.085
No one's gonna take over that
crap-hole once he's gone.

24:40.319 --> 24:42.155
And then the payments
will stop coming in.

24:42.487 --> 24:43.890
So, I thought, what's better,

24:44.390 --> 24:46.423
a guy with two broken knees
and an empty shop,

24:46.425 --> 24:49.829
or we wait a week or two and then
the payments will keep coming in?

24:51.596 --> 24:54.333
See, that's why I trust you
more than any of these clowns.

25:00.438 --> 25:03.308
I got a drop-off for you.
Two bricks of smack.

25:04.043 --> 25:07.610
Pure "H." Take it to the gas
station across the train tracks.

25:07.612 --> 25:10.315
- There'll be someone waiting for you.
- By the gas station?

25:10.615 --> 25:12.549
Give him the bricks,
come right back.

25:12.551 --> 25:13.986
All right.

25:19.257 --> 25:20.325
Lucas.

25:21.392 --> 25:23.961
This ain't no ordinary drop-off.
I'm counting on you.

25:23.963 --> 25:27.901
Get to the gas station,
make the drop, and come right back.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.804
You gotta get ready
for the wedding.

26:00.099 --> 26:02.101
Here, I got these from upstairs.

26:03.302 --> 26:04.871
They're dry.

26:08.207 --> 26:11.076
Thought you said you were gonna
stick to your prescription.

26:13.678 --> 26:16.416
<i>Doctors
changed up my dose again.</i>

26:19.251 --> 26:22.021
<i>At least Lucas sells me
what I need.</i>

26:29.628 --> 26:31.931
What happened
to the rest of it?

26:33.465 --> 26:34.467
The tattoo?

26:38.203 --> 26:40.137
I think it looks good
like that.

26:40.139 --> 26:43.008
It's, like... more special.

26:54.719 --> 26:56.188
Here.

27:18.544 --> 27:19.445
Daniel.

27:20.579 --> 27:22.415
Let's finish the Caddy.

27:26.584 --> 27:28.453
I want you
to keep an eye on him.

27:29.188 --> 27:30.721
He's meeting
our friend from El Salvador.

27:30.723 --> 27:32.455
You're sending him
across the tracks?

27:32.457 --> 27:35.591
The car's still outside.
I got the feds on my ass.

27:35.593 --> 27:37.930
I don't want no trouble
at my sister's wedding.

27:38.330 --> 27:40.997
I promised her I wouldn't
have any deals go down today.

27:40.999 --> 27:43.065
Then why send the kid?
I could make the deal.

27:43.067 --> 27:44.503
Are you stupid or something?

27:45.536 --> 27:47.005
Hmm?

27:48.340 --> 27:51.209
I just told you, the feds are on my ass.
It's gotta be the kid.

27:54.513 --> 27:56.082
Go, please.

27:58.016 --> 27:59.217
Jester...

27:59.517 --> 28:01.954
leave his kid brother alone.

28:06.025 --> 28:07.424
Yo. Yo, Lucas.

28:07.426 --> 28:10.229
- I'm busy, Rodrigo.
- Too busy for the jump-in?

28:13.232 --> 28:14.100
Whose jump-in?

28:14.565 --> 28:16.632
Watch your head
and take it like a man.

28:16.634 --> 28:19.802
And whatever you do,
don't cry like a bitch.

28:19.804 --> 28:21.504
Hey, Miguel. What the hell?

28:21.506 --> 28:23.205
- Hey! What are you doin'?
- He's not being jumped in.

28:23.207 --> 28:24.774
- Yeah, he is.
- No way! My brother's not!

28:24.776 --> 28:30.149
Just like me. Just like you, Lucas.
I got the call from Jester.

28:30.783 --> 28:33.649
Besides, you should be proud.

28:33.651 --> 28:37.521
Kid's got <i>cojones</i>
your older brother never had.

28:39.057 --> 28:39.790
Miguel!

28:39.792 --> 28:42.128
Don't let him scare you.

28:42.494 --> 28:45.628
Just 'cause his jump-in left
him with a couple broken bones,

28:45.630 --> 28:47.397
it don't mean
the same gonna happen to you.

28:47.399 --> 28:49.398
- Come on, Miguel!
- What you doin', huh?

28:49.400 --> 28:51.201
- What the...
- Fuck you, man.

28:51.203 --> 28:52.735
Hey, Miguel! Come on!
You don't have to do this!

28:52.737 --> 28:55.138
Come on, Miguel!
You're not being jumped in!

28:55.140 --> 28:58.442
Leave him alone! He's just a kid, man!
He's just a kid.

28:58.444 --> 28:59.408
Yeah!

28:59.410 --> 29:02.279
One, two...

29:02.281 --> 29:05.284
Get up!

29:05.817 --> 29:07.349
- Three.
- Leave him alone!

29:07.351 --> 29:09.488
- He's a kid, man! Let him go!
- Four.

29:11.223 --> 29:12.558
He's just a kid!

29:14.159 --> 29:16.528
Five. Six.

29:17.795 --> 29:22.634
Seven. Eight. Nine.

29:23.267 --> 29:26.271
Ten. Eleven.

29:34.713 --> 29:36.082
Twelve.

29:37.582 --> 29:38.618
Get off!

29:39.650 --> 29:40.850
Lucas!

29:40.852 --> 29:42.054
Thirteen!

29:52.797 --> 29:54.763
- You a bloody mess!
- Hey! Get off him, man!

29:54.765 --> 29:57.199
Well, at least
you didn't squeal like a girl.

29:57.201 --> 30:00.169
- Welcome to MS-13, bitch!
- Get off him. Hey.

30:00.171 --> 30:01.471
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

30:01.473 --> 30:03.273
Everything's gonna be fine.
Let's go.

30:03.275 --> 30:05.511
Hey, hey, hey. Where are you goin'?
He's gotta get to his spot. Hey!

30:05.843 --> 30:09.212
Look, I don't got time for this, man!
Rincon's gonna be pissed.

30:09.214 --> 30:10.546
- What?
- He's gonna be pissed.

30:10.548 --> 30:12.616
He wanted me
to take him to the drop-off.

30:12.618 --> 30:14.184
- Yeah? Well, he didn't tell me nothing.
- Of course he didn't!

30:14.186 --> 30:16.253
The delivery
is across the train tracks.

30:16.255 --> 30:18.221
He wanted me
to take him with me.

30:18.223 --> 30:19.356
- What?
- Hey, I...

30:19.358 --> 30:21.224
You wanna go ask Rincon?
Let's go.

30:21.226 --> 30:23.526
He should be with the priest and
Gabriela getting ready for the wedding.

30:23.528 --> 30:24.496
No, no, no.

30:25.730 --> 30:27.766
Well, go on. But then bring
his ass back to his corner.

30:28.367 --> 30:29.534
All right. Let's go.

30:29.868 --> 30:31.471
Wait.

30:40.579 --> 30:41.581
Come on.

31:04.902 --> 31:08.507
That's what I keep telling you.
You don't run with the gang.

31:11.342 --> 31:15.747
It's too late for me, but you're smart.
You have a chance at something.

31:17.416 --> 31:19.585
Do you just wanna
throw it all away?

31:42.274 --> 31:44.409
You were right about
the starter relay.

31:44.676 --> 31:47.213
Take it around the block.
Make sure...

31:48.714 --> 31:49.782
What?

33:13.364 --> 33:14.532
Wow.

33:18.070 --> 33:20.306
You look beautiful.

33:21.105 --> 33:24.409
Thank you for everything.

33:35.519 --> 33:37.522
I don't got
any pills on me, man.

33:41.525 --> 33:42.460
We're good.

33:43.027 --> 33:45.463
Why don't you mind
your own goddamn business?

33:57.441 --> 34:00.313
- The tracks are that way.
- We're not going to the tracks.

34:00.644 --> 34:02.480
I'm getting you out of here.

34:16.427 --> 34:18.063
- Why are we home?
- Just wait here.

34:18.728 --> 34:20.599
- Lucas.
- Just wait here!

35:14.052 --> 35:15.521
Drink up, drink up.

35:16.921 --> 35:18.187
Drink up. Come on.

35:18.189 --> 35:19.892
Come on.
Drop it and let's go.

35:20.659 --> 35:22.057
No, I'm not gonna leave her.

35:22.059 --> 35:23.892
I said let's go.
You're not taking it.

35:23.894 --> 35:25.928
It's our brother's dog!
I'm not gonna leave her.

35:25.930 --> 35:27.830
You think this is some kind of game?
I'm doing this for you.

35:27.832 --> 35:29.466
Look, I'm starting out
as a drug boy

35:29.468 --> 35:30.899
and working my way up,
just like you did.

35:30.901 --> 35:33.135
You're always acting like my...
What is that?

35:33.137 --> 35:34.706
You see what this says?

35:35.539 --> 35:37.976
You got in. You hear me?
You got in.

35:47.084 --> 35:49.921
All right, let's go.
We need to get out of here. Come on.

36:00.631 --> 36:02.631
Shit, I lost a brick.

36:02.633 --> 36:03.902
- Lucas!
- Fuck.

36:04.503 --> 36:05.671
Oh, shit.

36:07.104 --> 36:09.571
Whatever this is, I don't got time, man.
Gotta get to the drop-off point.

36:09.573 --> 36:11.140
Yeah, yeah.
Just like you told me.

36:11.142 --> 36:14.113
Rincon said to take your
brother, huh, smart-ass?

36:14.845 --> 36:16.713
That's what he said.
Why don't you believe me?

36:16.715 --> 36:17.946
Oh, cut the shit!

36:17.948 --> 36:19.851
Why ain't you
at the drop-off, huh?

36:20.552 --> 36:22.588
And what the fuck's
your brother doing here?

36:27.726 --> 36:29.461
Jester, you dumb-ass.

36:30.128 --> 36:32.128
What did you call me?

36:32.130 --> 36:34.664
Dumb-ass. You really think the deal's
going down by the train tracks?

36:34.666 --> 36:36.566
You think Rincon
would tell your fancy-ass face

36:36.568 --> 36:37.836
where the real
drop-off point is?

36:39.003 --> 36:40.206
Just 'cause he's your cousin,
you think he trusts you.

36:41.874 --> 36:43.907
With your Ricky Martin clothes and gel
and shit, like you're his right-hand man?

36:43.909 --> 36:45.941
"Oh, I'm Jester.
You gotta listen to me."

36:45.943 --> 36:48.644
You're not on top.
You never will be.

36:48.646 --> 36:50.979
I'm the right-hand man,
and you know it.

36:50.981 --> 36:53.251
Only me and Rincon know
where the deal's going down.

36:53.985 --> 36:55.887
Get out of my face.
I got shit to do.

36:57.555 --> 36:58.320
Come on.

37:13.905 --> 37:17.042
Let's go
ask Rincon ourselves, yes?

37:22.581 --> 37:26.619
Everybody, ready for the picture?
Come on, everybody.

37:27.184 --> 37:29.621
On the right side, please.

37:30.220 --> 37:32.791
Sir? Good. Good.

37:33.657 --> 37:35.660
Rincon, please?

37:37.227 --> 37:39.731
Everybody's waiting.
Could you get in the picture?

37:41.900 --> 37:42.800
Please?

37:43.101 --> 37:44.135
Rincon?

37:57.314 --> 37:59.918
Yes. Very good.

38:00.684 --> 38:01.853
Smile.

38:05.389 --> 38:07.957
You know how pissed Rincon's gonna
be when you interrupt the wedding?

38:07.959 --> 38:09.727
- You wanna be green-lit, Jester?
- Yeah.

38:10.095 --> 38:13.262
Except it'll be your ass green-lit.

38:13.264 --> 38:15.198
- I'm gonna fuck him up.
- Yeah, fuck him up.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.899
I should feel sorry for you.

38:16.901 --> 38:18.934
You remember what Rincon
did to Smiley last year

38:18.936 --> 38:21.004
just because he started
selling without his okay?

38:21.006 --> 38:22.905
They're still finding pieces...
Argh.

38:22.907 --> 38:26.979
Shut the fuck up. I don't wanna hear another word.

38:27.412 --> 38:30.015
Got it, smart-ass?

38:34.251 --> 38:36.986
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Leave him out of this, man.
- Lucas!

38:36.988 --> 38:39.325
- Leave him out of this.
- Get the fuck out of here, man.

38:39.890 --> 38:41.193
- Stop!
- Lucas!

38:41.892 --> 38:43.829
- Shoot the fuckin' dog.
- Lucas! Lucas!

38:44.262 --> 38:46.361
- What did that mean, man?
- Get the fuck off him, man.

38:46.363 --> 38:49.231
- Get yourself killed.
- Get off him, man! Leave him out of it!

38:49.233 --> 38:52.770
- He's just a kid!
- Get the fuck back, you punk!

38:58.709 --> 39:01.012
I don't mind. We'll skin
your kid brother first.

39:01.845 --> 39:03.114
Let you watch him die.

39:07.151 --> 39:07.885
You scared, kid?

39:10.155 --> 39:13.055
Boom! Boom, boom, boom.

39:13.057 --> 39:14.890
- Yeah!
- Put it down!

39:14.892 --> 39:17.292
You like that, kid?
You scared, kid? Huh?

39:17.294 --> 39:20.463
- You scared he gonna blow out your little brain, dude?
- Argh!

39:20.465 --> 39:21.834
What? Let's go.

39:22.099 --> 39:26.005
You're just a little bitch, man.

39:27.204 --> 39:29.372
Look at his face, man.

39:29.374 --> 39:30.907
Fucking fish, huh?

39:30.909 --> 39:34.178
Not so smart now, huh? Huh?

39:35.180 --> 39:36.749
Are you cryin', man?

39:37.448 --> 39:39.314
Look at him
when he talkin' to you.

39:39.316 --> 39:41.316
- Oh, he's gonna cry.
- Oh, you gonna cry, man.

39:41.318 --> 39:44.188
- I think he got something in his eye, man.
- Don't do it, me brother.

39:45.456 --> 39:47.792
Come on, you fuckin' midget.

40:04.209 --> 40:05.811
What the fuck?

40:06.010 --> 40:07.912
Can you boys give me a push?

40:09.514 --> 40:11.881
Get your shit out of the way, old man.
I said get it out of the fucking way!

40:19.124 --> 40:20.859
Hey! Hey!

40:27.432 --> 40:30.767
Come on! Hurry up! Just drop
the damn thing already.

40:30.769 --> 40:32.037
It's our brother's dog.

40:38.809 --> 40:40.978
- Come on, come on!
- Go, go, go. Go.

40:42.447 --> 40:43.948
Oh, shit!

40:48.153 --> 40:50.022
Go, go, go. Come on.

40:59.264 --> 41:00.198
Come on.

41:01.566 --> 41:03.135
Come on, come on, come on!

41:05.869 --> 41:07.739
Come on. Hurry up.

41:12.977 --> 41:15.748
- Leave the damn dog. Come on.
- Take the dog!

41:16.213 --> 41:17.349
Yo, hurry up!

41:22.486 --> 41:23.885
Yo, hurry up!

41:23.887 --> 41:24.954
Sorry.

41:28.293 --> 41:29.193
Come on!

41:48.546 --> 41:50.015
Move, move, move.

41:52.483 --> 41:54.052
Get the dog! Get the dog!

42:19.477 --> 42:20.813
Let us in.

42:21.044 --> 42:22.347
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

42:23.046 --> 42:25.213
- They're coming. Go! Go!
- Go! Go!

42:25.215 --> 42:26.916
- Go, go!
- Stop!

42:26.918 --> 42:28.820
- Go! Hurry!
- Stop, boy!

42:32.189 --> 42:34.425
They're right behind us! Lucas!

42:34.925 --> 42:36.027
Go straight. Go straight.

42:38.662 --> 42:41.099
Right, Daniel. On the right.

42:45.936 --> 42:47.271
Daniel, come on.

42:48.506 --> 42:51.343
Get in the street.
Right. Right. On the right.

42:55.313 --> 42:57.048
- Watch out!
- Go, go, go!

43:03.921 --> 43:05.389
Miguel, you okay?

43:12.563 --> 43:14.198
Miguel.

43:15.066 --> 43:17.002
- You hurt?
- I'm okay. It's the dog.

43:18.135 --> 43:20.872
He's dying. He's dying.

43:27.711 --> 43:30.946
- Watch out!
- Look out! Look out!

43:44.561 --> 43:45.963
They're coming.

43:47.365 --> 43:48.300
On your left.

43:49.133 --> 43:50.335
Shake them off.

43:51.168 --> 43:52.436
Shake 'em off, Daniel.

44:06.050 --> 44:07.486
- Argh!
- Get down.

44:11.488 --> 44:13.191
No! My gun!

44:15.059 --> 44:16.194
Watch out, Daniel.

44:19.997 --> 44:21.099
Get down!

44:44.655 --> 44:46.588
Why is all
this furniture busted up?

44:48.659 --> 44:52.030
- He says Afghan party...
- Calm the fuck down.

45:45.182 --> 45:49.218
- My leg! My frickin' leg!
- Let me get it out!

45:49.220 --> 45:51.456
Come on!

45:52.590 --> 45:57.129
No. No! No! Oh, my God!

45:59.863 --> 46:01.265
Hurry up!

46:04.836 --> 46:05.834
It's stuck!

46:11.508 --> 46:12.577
Come on.

46:14.211 --> 46:16.479
- We need to go. Come on.
- Wait! My dog!

46:16.481 --> 46:17.579
- No!
- Come on!

46:17.581 --> 46:19.280
No! No!

46:19.282 --> 46:21.584
- Leave the dog! Come on!
- No! No!

46:21.586 --> 46:22.852
Let's go.

46:27.358 --> 46:30.195
Come on. Come on.

46:31.262 --> 46:33.265
- It'll be fine.
- Ow. Argh.

46:33.697 --> 46:35.330
No, no.
No, don't touch it.

46:35.332 --> 46:36.735
- Stop, Miguel.
- Don't touch it, dude.

46:37.235 --> 46:39.602
You're making it worse.
All right, stop.

46:39.604 --> 46:41.836
- Let me see it, man.
- Stop. Stop.

46:41.838 --> 46:43.541
- It's all right.
- Ow.

46:54.151 --> 46:56.655
We're safe here as long as
those cops are still by the car.

47:03.628 --> 47:05.130
Is he gonna be okay?

47:09.267 --> 47:10.435
How does it look?

47:14.671 --> 47:15.606
Shirt?

47:16.606 --> 47:17.575
Yeah.

47:36.693 --> 47:38.195
Argh.

47:42.400 --> 47:44.401
Okay.

47:55.412 --> 47:56.747
Where'd you learn all that?

47:57.581 --> 47:58.749
Military?

48:04.287 --> 48:06.224
My older brother was a Marine.

48:09.660 --> 48:10.595
You remember?

48:11.528 --> 48:13.532
Yeah, he got drafted
as a green card soldier.

48:13.930 --> 48:16.832
He wanted to get out, you know.
He wanted a different life for us.

48:16.834 --> 48:18.600
He wanted to get out of there.

48:18.602 --> 48:21.836
He used to send us pictures of
him shooting his guns. Remember?

48:21.838 --> 48:23.340
It was awesome.

48:24.809 --> 48:27.611
He hated the food from there.
And the weather. He wasn't used to it.

48:32.717 --> 48:35.686
He got killed in action
before he got his citizenship.

48:43.860 --> 48:45.763
Yeah, so whatever.

48:52.470 --> 48:53.638
What, citizenship?

48:54.805 --> 48:56.338
Don't know.

48:56.340 --> 48:57.840
Rincon just told us
if anyone found out about us,

48:57.842 --> 49:00.477
they'll take us away and put
us into a home or some shit.

49:07.952 --> 49:10.222
Yeah, the two of us.

49:10.820 --> 49:14.625
It used to be us and our dad, but he
split after Jose left for Afghanistan.

49:16.494 --> 49:18.262
Better off anyway.

49:19.030 --> 49:21.765
You ever was there?
Afghanistan?

49:25.568 --> 49:29.373
This will be the moment.
It will be beautiful. Your moment.

49:29.673 --> 49:30.742
Hey.

49:31.843 --> 49:33.908
Of course, during the mass,
I will ask you to read...

49:33.910 --> 49:37.780
<i>la carta del apóstol San Pablo
a los corintios.</i>

49:37.782 --> 49:38.984
You'll be the one...

49:45.423 --> 49:47.392
- Okay?
- Rincon!

50:03.407 --> 50:06.544
He's got the whole clique on us.
We gotta go. We gotta move now.

50:16.586 --> 50:18.355
It's baseball camp for Miguel.

50:21.057 --> 50:22.360
Let's go.

50:31.401 --> 50:32.403
I knew...

50:33.371 --> 50:35.506
that kid wasn't goin'
to make no drop-off.

50:36.639 --> 50:38.709
You saw him drive off
with the <i>chavala?</i>

50:39.110 --> 50:40.577
He helped him get away.

50:40.945 --> 50:41.845
The package?

50:44.814 --> 50:46.318
He's still got it.

50:55.559 --> 50:57.762
I always knew
he'd turn his back on you.

50:58.729 --> 51:00.598
After all you did for him.

51:02.465 --> 51:04.335
I gave you one job.

51:05.936 --> 51:07.635
To look after him.

51:07.637 --> 51:09.171
And you couldn't do that?

51:09.173 --> 51:11.743
Now I gotta fuckin'
fix this for you?

51:13.177 --> 51:15.780
Get everybody.

51:17.414 --> 51:20.384
I want the bricks
and I want the kid.

51:21.785 --> 51:22.820
Alive.

51:25.622 --> 51:26.691
Yes.

51:34.731 --> 51:36.934
Knowing Rincon,
he's got his drug boys on lookout.

51:42.506 --> 51:44.008
It ain't here.

51:44.508 --> 51:45.673
What?

51:45.675 --> 51:47.175
The brick.
It fell in the car.

51:47.177 --> 51:50.047
- What?
- The brick. It's our only chance.

51:50.814 --> 51:53.148
<i>Wait
here while I get another car.</i>

51:53.150 --> 51:54.586
Miguel, let's go.

51:56.052 --> 51:57.788
<i>I'll drive you out.</i>

51:58.021 --> 51:59.523
Why do you wanna help us?

52:00.791 --> 52:01.693
Let's go.

52:03.793 --> 52:06.930
Look... Okay, I'll be back.
All right.

52:19.209 --> 52:20.778
Congratulations.

52:22.213 --> 52:23.814
I'm glad I'm not late.

52:24.247 --> 52:25.749
I love weddings.

52:26.983 --> 52:28.018
Go inside.

52:46.035 --> 52:47.005
Oh, shit.

52:53.977 --> 52:57.615
My first time in DC.
Maybe you show me the sights.

52:57.981 --> 53:00.584
Who's that president
sitting on the big chair?

53:01.552 --> 53:03.121
You shouldn't be here, Spider.

53:03.686 --> 53:05.923
I told you to wait on the
other side of the tracks.

53:06.289 --> 53:07.958
Your homeboy never showed.

53:08.157 --> 53:09.193
Hmm.

53:10.595 --> 53:14.466
The <i>federales</i> could've seen you.
They've been on my ass all day.

53:17.267 --> 53:18.869
You mean those <i>hura</i> bitches?

53:20.570 --> 53:22.539
I spotted that shit
a mile away.

53:29.113 --> 53:32.784
Back in El Salvador,
they say you're hot shit.

53:33.249 --> 53:36.119
"That Rincon, he a badass.

53:36.720 --> 53:38.923
One day, he gonna run
the entire East Coast."

53:42.226 --> 53:43.291
I need badass.

53:43.293 --> 53:45.996
Don't worry. You'll get it.

53:48.231 --> 53:51.633
I couldn't get close enough to the car.
But I saw the brick. It's full of cash.

53:51.635 --> 53:53.635
Cash? How much cash?

53:53.637 --> 53:56.037
I don't know,
but more than I've ever seen before.

53:56.039 --> 53:58.543
Why is it full of money
instead of drugs?

53:59.610 --> 54:01.012
It's back at the apartment.

54:01.278 --> 54:03.615
- What?
- The other brick.

54:04.715 --> 54:06.648
I need to get that money.
Let's go.

54:06.650 --> 54:09.686
<i>Capitan</i> is in prison expecting
you to make your payment.

54:12.155 --> 54:14.323
I can't go back without
that quarter million.

54:14.325 --> 54:17.529
You think this is local heat?

54:19.630 --> 54:21.229
This is the feds
we're talking about.

54:21.231 --> 54:23.901
After they took down
the <i>clicas</i> in Virginia...

54:24.334 --> 54:25.802
I gotta be smart.

54:27.003 --> 54:29.905
They find out about the money,
they take out our entire crew.

54:29.907 --> 54:31.340
I gotta look out
for my <i>familia.</i>

54:31.342 --> 54:34.546
That's why this was supposed
to look like a drug deal.

54:35.211 --> 54:38.815
And you were supposed to be
on the other side of the tracks.

54:39.749 --> 54:42.052
<i>Run now,
while you have the chance.</i>

54:42.352 --> 54:45.019
Chance? What chance?
Look at us, man.

54:45.021 --> 54:46.887
The only kind of future
kids like us got

54:46.889 --> 54:48.624
is getting drafted by
the army or by the gang.

54:48.626 --> 54:50.626
And even then,
if I get into that baseball camp,

54:50.628 --> 54:53.097
what chance you think I got
without that kind of cash?

54:54.231 --> 54:55.600
Miguel, let's go.

54:57.001 --> 54:59.200
<i>He'll get you killed, Miguel.</i>

54:59.202 --> 55:02.072
Hey, you don't tell my brother what to do.
I know what's best for him!

55:02.271 --> 55:04.041
I raised him on my own.

55:05.142 --> 55:08.309
Back off, all right?
I don't wanna hear that phone no more.

55:10.280 --> 55:12.150
I sell drugs to you, man.

55:13.717 --> 55:15.253
Why would I listen to you?

55:15.785 --> 55:17.854
Leave us alone! Let's go.

56:13.010 --> 56:18.046
I'm on my way to my grandmother's
who lives deep in the woods.

56:18.048 --> 56:22.283
And what have you got in your
basket, Little Red Riding Hood?

56:24.153 --> 56:27.388
Some yummy carrot cake
for my poor old grandmother

56:27.390 --> 56:29.293
so that she can feel better.

56:31.128 --> 56:34.329
Carrot cake?
I'm allergic to carrots.

56:42.939 --> 56:44.275
What are we waiting for?

56:57.121 --> 57:00.791
Let's go. Come on.
Stay low, stay low. Come on.

57:14.037 --> 57:15.504
Anyone else down here?

57:15.506 --> 57:17.041
No, just me.

57:17.775 --> 57:18.910
Come on.

57:19.843 --> 57:20.912
Hurry up.

57:21.845 --> 57:22.814
Thanks for opening it.

57:24.182 --> 57:26.417
- Come on, Miguel, hurry up.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

57:27.383 --> 57:29.954
Don't worry about it, man.
Thank you. Appreciate it.

57:30.454 --> 57:31.823
Come on.

57:40.564 --> 57:41.866
Come on.

57:46.302 --> 57:49.037
Hey, where you been?
Everybody's lookin' for you.

57:49.039 --> 57:50.539
Shh. Quiet the fuck down.

57:50.541 --> 57:52.407
Rincon's got the whole clique
looking for your ass.

57:52.409 --> 57:55.109
Said you stole his smack.
Tried to make a run for it.

57:55.111 --> 57:56.544
Do me a favor,
go stand over there.

57:56.546 --> 57:57.879
Anyone comes up,
you let me know.

57:57.881 --> 57:59.414
- All right? Thanks.
- Okay.

57:59.416 --> 58:01.115
- Go it. Keep my eyes open. I'm watching you.
- Shh.

58:01.117 --> 58:02.450
- Shut the fuck up.
- Always watching you!

58:02.452 --> 58:04.019
- Shut up.
- Don't forget. I got your back.

58:04.021 --> 58:05.189
Shut the fuck up.

58:10.827 --> 58:11.963
Come on.

58:13.095 --> 58:14.030
Get back.

58:17.267 --> 58:18.202
Hurry up.

58:22.905 --> 58:24.041
Close the door.

58:40.057 --> 58:41.555
Is everything okay?

58:41.557 --> 58:44.061
Everything is fine. Okay?

58:44.427 --> 58:46.029
Just like I promised.

58:47.631 --> 58:48.933
Let us be.

58:53.236 --> 58:55.907
Go outside.
Don't talk to anyone.

58:56.572 --> 58:59.943
By the time the wedding ends, the money
will be here, and you'll be out of here.

59:07.251 --> 59:08.352
Shit.

59:12.923 --> 59:13.991
Yes.

59:18.227 --> 59:20.430
- Come on. You got it?
- Yeah, let's go.

59:25.535 --> 59:26.838
Come on.

59:29.106 --> 59:31.372
Come on. It's clear.
Right out the back.

59:31.374 --> 59:33.110
- Come on.
- Come on. Let's go.

59:37.113 --> 59:38.849
Come on. Let's go.

59:39.349 --> 59:40.251
Come on.

59:44.186 --> 59:45.954
Come on, guys, let's go.

59:45.956 --> 59:47.224
- All right?
- Yeah.

59:51.327 --> 59:52.559
Whoa!

59:52.561 --> 59:54.461
- You lying rat!
- Hey!

59:54.463 --> 59:56.932
Don't be like that, Lucas.
Finally getting down with the gang.

59:56.934 --> 59:58.332
- I trusted you, man!
- Lucas!

59:58.334 --> 01:00:01.970
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, don't blame little <i>gordito.</i>

01:00:01.972 --> 01:00:03.972
He's just doing
what he's told, man.

01:00:03.974 --> 01:00:05.273
Just business.

01:00:05.275 --> 01:00:07.077
Maybe you should've done
the fucking same, huh?

01:00:07.543 --> 01:00:09.010
Hey, get off me, man.

01:00:09.012 --> 01:00:10.414
Let me see it.

01:00:12.416 --> 01:00:15.052
- Where's the other brick?
- I don't got it.

01:00:17.521 --> 01:00:19.287
Where's the other brick?

01:00:19.289 --> 01:00:20.624
I'm telling you the truth.

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.423
I swear.

01:00:26.063 --> 01:00:27.898
Oh, this was it?

01:00:29.166 --> 01:00:30.198
- Ow.
- Leave him alone!

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.066
You wanna keep playin' games?

01:00:32.068 --> 01:00:33.734
- Get off me!
- I don't got it, I swear. It burned in the fire.

01:00:33.736 --> 01:00:35.503
- What?
- It's ash!

01:00:35.505 --> 01:00:37.073
It's all ash.

01:00:38.307 --> 01:00:39.309
I swear.

01:00:43.113 --> 01:00:44.948
Where's the <i>chavala?</i>

01:00:50.253 --> 01:00:51.988
- Ah...
- Hey.

01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:55.059
What is that?

01:00:56.593 --> 01:00:57.495
Okay.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.229
They're ready.

01:00:59.628 --> 01:01:00.931
Okay.

01:01:57.686 --> 01:01:59.122
No, you stay away.

01:01:59.655 --> 01:02:00.590
This is all your fault.

01:02:02.124 --> 01:02:03.791
You stay away. It's okay.

01:02:45.668 --> 01:02:47.437
They were looking for you.

01:02:48.805 --> 01:02:52.276
They said you stole Rincon's drugs.
You and the kids.

01:02:52.709 --> 01:02:53.611
Did you?

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:05.352
They couldn't find them on
Lucas, so they were looking here.

01:03:05.354 --> 01:03:07.257
They tore this place apart.

01:03:17.233 --> 01:03:19.202
They had them in the car.

01:03:19.769 --> 01:03:21.505
Both of them.

01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:47.598
<i>Está bien.</i>

01:03:51.668 --> 01:03:53.470
Don't get involved.

01:04:15.724 --> 01:04:18.561
What are you doing?
I could talk to him.

01:04:19.262 --> 01:04:21.532
Out of respect for my ex,
they'll listen to me.

01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:28.539
You're going after them,
aren't you?

01:04:30.673 --> 01:04:33.675
You know what's gonna happen to
you if you go in there alone?

01:04:33.677 --> 01:04:36.380
Do you know
what they're gonna do to you?

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.582
This isn't your fight.

01:04:39.883 --> 01:04:42.186
Why don't you just call the cops
or something? Why do you have...

01:04:48.291 --> 01:04:50.294
Francisco, my ex.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.229
He got this tat
on the back of his hand.

01:04:54.564 --> 01:04:57.434
Three dots.
All the <i>maras</i> have it.

01:04:58.367 --> 01:05:00.170
Do you know what it means?

01:05:02.872 --> 01:05:06.544
It's the three places you end
up once you join the gang.

01:05:07.644 --> 01:05:08.579
Hospital...

01:05:09.813 --> 01:05:10.713
prison...

01:05:11.648 --> 01:05:12.716
the grave.

01:05:13.682 --> 01:05:16.186
You think
you're different from them?

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.621
You're not.

01:05:19.856 --> 01:05:20.758
Soldiers.

01:05:22.325 --> 01:05:23.460
<i>Maras.</i>

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.729
Stupid-ass boys...

01:05:25.996 --> 01:05:28.231
doing stupid-ass things.

01:05:33.535 --> 01:05:34.470
No.

01:05:36.006 --> 01:05:37.308
Just...

01:05:39.843 --> 01:05:42.443
Just... talk.

01:06:47.977 --> 01:06:49.644
Amen.

01:07:25.615 --> 01:07:28.552
Oh, man,
I can't wait to see your face...

01:07:29.586 --> 01:07:32.723
when el Rincon
marks you <i>luz verde.</i>

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:35.925
Take you up
to Daingerfield Island.

01:07:42.164 --> 01:07:43.599
Who knows?

01:07:44.767 --> 01:07:47.738
Maybe he'll even let me
cut up the two of you myself.

01:07:48.104 --> 01:07:49.773
I don't know which one.

01:07:51.106 --> 01:07:52.442
Eenie...

01:07:53.476 --> 01:07:56.880
miney, mo.

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.881
See, I don't even know
the fucking rhyme,

01:07:59.883 --> 01:08:04.955
but I think he'll cut up you
first so you can fucking watch it.

01:08:05.155 --> 01:08:07.624
Yeah.

01:09:22.831 --> 01:09:24.997
You hungry?
You want something to eat?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.935
What the fuck do you care
if they're hungry?

01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:30.740
The kids don't need no food.

01:09:33.576 --> 01:09:34.745
Now run back out there...

01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:36.813
and get us some beers.

01:10:00.303 --> 01:10:01.269
Hey.

01:10:01.271 --> 01:10:03.037
What, you don't like boys?

01:10:03.039 --> 01:10:05.008
What the fuck?

01:10:23.893 --> 01:10:27.261
Gotta put your bitches in check.
What kind of crew you run?

01:10:33.635 --> 01:10:35.571
Hey, that's the <i>chavala.</i>

01:10:36.606 --> 01:10:40.074
- No way, man.
- Hey, what you doing down here, white boy?

01:10:40.076 --> 01:10:41.512
Fucking junkie.

01:10:42.077 --> 01:10:44.779
You in the wrong
part of town now, fucker.

01:10:44.781 --> 01:10:46.646
Wanna get your fix, huh?

01:10:46.648 --> 01:10:50.553
Ooh. You wanna party?
Where the fuck you think you in?

01:10:53.656 --> 01:10:54.825
Yeah, motherfucker.

01:10:56.925 --> 01:10:59.129
Sit the fuck down,
motherfucker.

01:11:02.231 --> 01:11:07.137
That is how we deal with
punk-ass gringos here in DC, boy!

01:11:08.737 --> 01:11:10.203
You gonna die today, bitch.

01:11:10.205 --> 01:11:12.976
You come into my house...

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:47.945
Okay! Fuck!

01:11:54.317 --> 01:11:56.019
Argh!

01:12:37.259 --> 01:12:39.963
Go clean the kitchen
and check on Brenda.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.689
Shattered legs...

01:13:06.488 --> 01:13:08.659
they heal in time.

01:13:12.461 --> 01:13:14.196
But some betrayals...

01:13:19.469 --> 01:13:22.039
fester and poison the soul.

01:13:35.384 --> 01:13:37.220
I'm a fucking dead man.

01:13:39.988 --> 01:13:41.957
On my sister's wedding,

01:13:42.525 --> 01:13:44.161
you pull this shit?

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:51.267
And now I got a dead man
in my kitchen.

01:14:02.378 --> 01:14:05.245
Last night, you're getting fucked.
I see all these fucking...

01:14:05.247 --> 01:14:08.485
You know something?
You're fucking dead.

01:14:09.251 --> 01:14:11.217
- You know what's really fucked up?
- What?

01:14:11.219 --> 01:14:14.724
You bringing in a bag of tortilla
chips on a Mexican stakeout.

01:14:42.351 --> 01:14:43.786
Where's my other brick?

01:14:47.924 --> 01:14:50.490
Jesus Christ. Who the hell?
Call 217. Now.

01:14:50.492 --> 01:14:52.560
FBI task 443. FBI task 443.

01:14:52.562 --> 01:14:55.296
Send some units. Breaking protocol.
I repeat. Breaking protocol.

01:14:55.298 --> 01:14:57.030
Am I a bitch?

01:14:57.032 --> 01:14:59.033
Hey! What the fuck?

01:14:59.035 --> 01:15:01.034
- What the fuck? Get down, motherfucker!
- Put the fucking gun down!

01:15:01.036 --> 01:15:03.139
Put that gun down, motherfucker.

01:15:06.308 --> 01:15:08.909
- Get in here, you white piece of shit!
- Let's go, man! Go!

01:15:08.911 --> 01:15:11.611
- FBI! Drop your weapon!
- Put down the fucking gun, man!

01:15:11.613 --> 01:15:15.785
Fuck you, <i>hura!</i> You in our world now.
You fucking drop it.

01:15:16.219 --> 01:15:17.387
Drop your weapon!

01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:23.324
Drop the fucking gun,
motherfucker!

01:15:23.326 --> 01:15:26.062
Son, <i>¿te quieres morir?</i>
Drop your weapon!

01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:30.497
- Put the fucking gun down.
- Drop your weapon.

01:15:30.499 --> 01:15:32.402
- You fucking drop it.
- Drop the fuckin' gun.

01:15:41.477 --> 01:15:43.947
Get down, get down.
Get down, Miguel.

01:15:46.549 --> 01:15:47.818
Oh, fuck.

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.356
Get down, get down.

01:16:17.379 --> 01:16:18.380
Lucas!

01:17:45.201 --> 01:17:46.536
No, no, no, no.

01:18:10.092 --> 01:18:11.961
Go get my sister.

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.356
Gabriela!

01:20:58.693 --> 01:21:00.729
Help! Help me!

01:21:26.821 --> 01:21:28.223
Come on, Daniel.

01:21:30.425 --> 01:21:32.661
Nowhere left to run,
motherfucker.

01:21:36.432 --> 01:21:38.798
You ain't talking your way
out of this one.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.836
Sit the fuck down, motherfucker.

01:21:41.336 --> 01:21:43.436
Get down!

01:21:43.438 --> 01:21:47.407
The reason you ain't dead already is
'cause Rincon gonna kill you himself.

01:21:47.409 --> 01:21:48.545
Hey!

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.361
Why?

01:22:11.332 --> 01:22:12.535
Why'd you do it?

01:22:14.737 --> 01:22:15.672
You know why.

01:22:18.406 --> 01:22:20.409
I was like a father to you.

01:22:23.012 --> 01:22:25.348
I treated you like my son.

01:22:27.348 --> 01:22:29.751
And now, Gabriela,
she's dead.

01:22:31.987 --> 01:22:33.356
She's dead!

01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:41.798
Look at me!

01:23:00.915 --> 01:23:02.384
Please.

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.409
Lucas.

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.348
Go.

01:23:33.648 --> 01:23:34.683
What?

01:23:36.018 --> 01:23:37.887
And don't fucking come back.

01:23:42.558 --> 01:23:44.427
You're gonna let him go?

01:23:46.995 --> 01:23:51.431
After he betrayed you, took the money,
you're gonna fucking let him off?

01:23:51.433 --> 01:23:52.535
Jester.

01:23:53.568 --> 01:23:55.604
You... you fucking lost it, bro.

01:23:55.838 --> 01:23:59.608
If you weren't so soft on the kid,
none of this would've gone down.

01:24:01.576 --> 01:24:04.079
Well, fuck you, Rinc.
What you gonna do, huh?

01:24:04.479 --> 01:24:06.113
What the fuck you gonna do?

01:24:06.115 --> 01:24:09.786
Should've trusted me with the drop-off.
That's a kid!

01:24:11.452 --> 01:24:13.723
You're my own flesh and blood.

01:24:15.624 --> 01:24:17.791
My little cousin, man.

01:24:17.793 --> 01:24:21.531
All I wanted
was to be the next in line!

01:24:21.964 --> 01:24:23.800
- Now I am!
- Jester.

01:24:24.799 --> 01:24:25.867
No!

01:24:26.634 --> 01:24:27.570
No!

01:24:28.137 --> 01:24:29.405
No.

01:24:39.915 --> 01:24:41.351
Toss it over!

01:24:42.918 --> 01:24:44.720
You drop the fucking gun.

01:24:53.429 --> 01:24:54.797
Give me the fucking brick.

01:24:55.664 --> 01:24:57.500
Give me the fucking brick.

01:25:28.964 --> 01:25:32.602
All right, boys, let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:36.906
Hold his mouth. Hold his mouth.

01:25:37.138 --> 01:25:38.473
Breathe. Breathe.

01:25:39.508 --> 01:25:41.077
Give me two. Give me two.
Quick. Come on. Hurry.

01:25:41.576 --> 01:25:43.243
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

01:25:43.245 --> 01:25:44.543
Come on. Breathe.

01:25:44.545 --> 01:25:45.947
<i>Where's the money?</i>

01:25:46.948 --> 01:25:48.617
Where's the money?

01:25:51.085 --> 01:25:52.854
Where's the fucking money?

01:27:12.134 --> 01:27:13.803
Lucas. Lucas.

01:27:24.045 --> 01:27:25.514
We did it, Miguel.

01:28:34.116 --> 01:28:37.153
Come on! Come on, run!
Come on!

01:28:38.085 --> 01:28:38.920
Yes!

01:28:39.888 --> 01:28:41.991
Yes, Miguel!
That's what I'm talkin' about!
