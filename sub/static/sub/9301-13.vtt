WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:36.769 --> 01:37.997
You sent for me?

01:38.203 --> 01:39.898
Are you ready?

01:40.139 --> 01:41.139
Oh I'm ready.

01:41.340 --> 01:42.432
...and the army?

01:42.741 --> 01:44.936
The army awaits my command.

01:46.011 --> 01:48.309
No, my command.

01:48.714 --> 01:50.011
Oh yeah, of course!

01:51.417 --> 01:55.410
Well, I hope He-Man tries to stop
us, because this time...

01:55.988 --> 01:58.957
we will crush him!

02:24.283 --> 02:26.513
There, that should hold him.

02:26.985 --> 02:28.484
He won't be able to get out of that.

02:28.587 --> 02:31.920
Well, it looks like you've done it
again, Man-At-Arms...

02:32.424 --> 02:34.415
He-Man could put this to good use.

02:35.094 --> 02:36.994
Right, Father, I'm sure he could.

02:38.630 --> 02:42.596
Is that it?
Can I go now?

02:43.535 --> 02:46.026
Go ahead and try, Orko.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.831
You weren't supposed to be able to do that.

02:50.909 --> 02:53.776
The Lasso should have held you
until we released the controls.

02:54.746 --> 02:58.409
Well. Looks like you,
better get back to the drawing board,huh?

02:58.817 --> 03:00.910
Maybe if we changed the diode output.

03:01.954 --> 03:04.422
No, I think it's the
oscillating frequency, Teela.

03:04.890 --> 03:07.358
Well, I'm sure you can
get this invention...

03:07.626 --> 03:09.253
this Lasso, to work.

03:10.829 --> 03:12.319
Absolutely, if...

03:12.398 --> 03:16.562
we adjust this knob over here,
that will control the radiation flow.

03:19.605 --> 03:22.904
Well, this is all very interesting,
but, you'll have to excuse me.

03:23.175 --> 03:27.202
Have fun with the Lasso.
I... have an important appointment.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.615
Important? Hah! I'll bet.

03:31.917 --> 03:35.011
Why can't Prince Adam show some
interest in something other than fun,

03:35.087 --> 03:36.987
 fun, fun!

03:38.090 --> 03:39.990
I wish... he would.

03:52.905 --> 03:54.167
Come on, Cringer.

03:56.942 --> 04:00.275
We have some work ahead of us.
The Sorceress wants to see us.

04:00.679 --> 04:03.705
Oh, I just hope it's not dangerous.

04:04.516 --> 04:07.576
By the power of Grayskull.

04:15.494 --> 04:20.089
I have the power!

04:36.381 --> 04:40.112
Lets go, Battle Cat! To Castle Grayskull.

04:40.352 --> 04:42.616
[shouting] What are we waiting for?

05:08.013 --> 05:09.844
We came as quickly as we could.

05:10.148 --> 05:13.640
I knew you would. There's no time to lose.

05:13.919 --> 05:17.013
Skeletor has a new scheme
that threatens Eternia.

05:17.322 --> 05:19.483
You must go to the region of Stardica,

05:19.691 --> 05:22.057
but the only thing in Stardica
is the old fortress that...

05:22.227 --> 05:23.395
hasn't been used in years.

05:23.395 --> 05:24.919
Until now.

05:25.230 --> 05:29.690
Skeletor has Trap Jaw and
Beast Man assembling a huge army...

05:29.935 --> 05:31.562
to take over Eternia...

05:31.770 --> 05:35.035
and ultimately Castle
Grayskull and its secrets.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.208
I'll ask Man-At-Arms to join me.

05:37.409 --> 05:39.969
That is wise. But be careful.

05:40.279 --> 05:43.305
Things are not always, what they seem.

05:43.549 --> 05:44.743
I'll do my best.

06:09.274 --> 06:10.639
I agree with you, Teela.

06:10.842 --> 06:14.471
The problem with the Lasso must be in
the electromagnetic radiation output.

06:14.947 --> 06:18.439
We have to adjust the wavelengths.
Make them shorter.

06:19.351 --> 06:20.716
Like this, father?

06:21.053 --> 06:22.384
Yes, that's fine.

06:22.688 --> 06:25.156
Now if we amplify the
electronic circuits...

06:25.624 --> 06:28.024
creating a circular laser...

06:28.427 --> 06:29.917
Shall I adjust the control knob?

06:30.195 --> 06:32.425
Yes, move it two stops to the right.

06:36.168 --> 06:40.662
Good, Teela. I think we almost have it.
Just a little more work.

06:40.839 --> 06:43.137
I though I'd find you in here, Duncan.

06:43.308 --> 06:44.308
He-Man!

06:46.078 --> 06:47.078
Hello, Teela.

06:47.179 --> 06:48.179
What is it?

06:48.547 --> 06:51.516
It's Skeletor.
He's using Beast Man and Trap Jaw...

06:51.783 --> 06:53.478
on a plan to take over Eternia.

06:53.785 --> 06:55.980
What is his plan?

06:56.188 --> 06:58.782
He is raising some sort of army.
That's what we have to...

06:58.957 --> 07:00.948
find out and stop. Whatever it is.

07:01.159 --> 07:04.617
Yeah, when Skeletor's on
the move, there's no time to lose.

07:05.464 --> 07:06.658
Then, let's go.

07:06.932 --> 07:09.594
No Teela, I want you to
finish working on the Lasso.

07:09.801 --> 07:12.235
But, Father,
my place is with you and He-Man!

07:12.504 --> 07:15.064
You'll be of much more
help working on the lasso.

07:15.941 --> 07:17.374
Yes, father.

07:30.622 --> 07:34.888
So you really think you and
your friends can stop me, He-Man?

07:43.769 --> 07:47.398
Trap Jaw can make these Serpentoids
as fast as we need them...

07:47.706 --> 07:51.198
and with my strategy,
Beast Man will lead them to victory.

07:51.476 --> 07:58.348
Then I, Skeletor, will rule
Eternia... and soon Castle Grayskull.

07:58.617 --> 08:02.576
My army will stop
He-Man once and for all.

08:08.427 --> 08:11.328
Orko, will you come to
the workshop immediately?

08:12.431 --> 08:13.659
Immediate enough?

08:13.999 --> 08:15.660
Huh? That was fast.

08:15.867 --> 08:19.132
Well, I am a magician, and for you Teela...

08:19.471 --> 08:22.099
I would do... anything!

08:22.607 --> 08:25.041
You're sweet, ahem.

08:25.711 --> 08:29.442
Now, I think I've perfected this
Lasso and I need you to help test it.

08:29.548 --> 08:30.607
Must I?

08:30.649 --> 08:32.879
You said you'd do anything for me.

08:33.118 --> 08:35.268
Oh, sometimes I talk too much.

08:35.293 --> 08:37.871
All right, Teela.
What shall I do?

08:38.023 --> 08:39.785
Float over there, please.

08:45.030 --> 08:47.396
Okay, Orko. Try to get out.

08:49.801 --> 08:53.328
I did it! The Lasso works!

08:59.044 --> 09:02.377
Hmm, no reason I shouldn't
join my father and He-Man...

09:02.447 --> 09:04.347
now that I've fixed the Lasso, is there?

09:04.583 --> 09:08.019
After all, the Lasso might
be of great use to them.

09:08.487 --> 09:12.947
Uh Teela, would you get me out of
this, please?

09:13.558 --> 09:16.352
Uh, oh, sure.  Just a sec.

09:16.461 --> 09:18.929
Trap Jaw and Beast Man
could be pretty tricky...

09:19.164 --> 09:21.564
especially when Skeletor's
calling the shots.

09:22.734 --> 09:23.826
Uh... Teela?

09:24.169 --> 09:26.933
Oh, Orko! Hold on. I'll let you out.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.470
[sigh] The things I do for you!

09:40.485 --> 09:43.579
There's no sign of
anyone, much less an army.

09:43.789 --> 09:46.053
They're around here, somewhere.
And we have to find them.

09:57.202 --> 09:58.897
I don't even see any guards.

09:59.638 --> 10:01.071
That is strange.

10:03.208 --> 10:04.675
We better split up.

10:04.976 --> 10:06.307
You check over there.

10:17.222 --> 10:18.120
Stand Back!

10:24.663 --> 10:27.530
Duncan, try to get back to the Sky-Sled.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.729
It's time to send your...

10:35.040 --> 10:38.669
Friend, for
Man-At-Arms, Beast Man.

10:40.445 --> 10:42.538
Yes, Skeletor.

10:47.084 --> 10:48.084
I...

10:48.854 --> 10:52.847
Beast Man,
command you to do my bidding.

10:53.491 --> 10:55.652
and do it now!

10:58.496 --> 11:00.327
Good, Beast Man!

11:02.667 --> 11:06.068
My plan, is working... perfectly.

11:23.521 --> 11:25.079
Hand on, Battle Cat.

11:31.696 --> 11:35.325
He-Man, help.  Help!

11:37.269 --> 11:38.759
Man-At-Arms!

11:39.037 --> 11:40.766
Beast Man must be behind this.

11:41.106 --> 11:42.698
But what does Skeletor have in mind?

11:44.876 --> 11:47.242
I'll get to the bottom of this.

11:54.384 --> 11:58.013
Glad you could drop in, Man-At-Arms!

11:58.290 --> 12:02.056
I'm, I'm sorry I don't feel the
same, Beast Man.

12:04.562 --> 12:08.396
Forget it.  You won't not need this.

12:09.334 --> 12:12.098
You won't need anything.

12:22.414 --> 12:23.438
Trap Jaw.

12:24.582 --> 12:25.913
Yes, Skeletor.

12:25.984 --> 12:29.579
He-Man has taken the bait.
He's coming to rescue Man-At-Arms.

12:30.321 --> 12:32.653
Get ready to release our army.

12:32.924 --> 12:34.050
I'm ready.

12:48.340 --> 12:50.570
I do not understand it.

12:50.875 --> 12:53.309
Why isn't the fortress defended?

12:53.378 --> 12:54.345
I don't know,

12:54.412 --> 12:57.638
and we still haven't seen any of
Skeletor's so-called unstoppable army.

12:57.682 --> 12:59.946
That only puts me more on guard.

13:00.018 --> 13:01.007
Let's go.

13:04.189 --> 13:05.554
Good going, Battle Cat.

13:12.998 --> 13:14.932
Where's that coming from?

13:24.242 --> 13:25.174
Looks like he...

13:25.410 --> 13:28.971
or should I say they have
just answered your question.

13:30.048 --> 13:31.276
C'mon, Battle Cat.

13:43.261 --> 13:44.888
No, you don't.

13:47.866 --> 13:50.198
Oh! Would you like to dance?

13:55.874 --> 13:57.705
There's another one,
Battle Cat, over there.

14:06.317 --> 14:07.875
Look, it's a machine.

14:08.086 --> 14:11.544
The Sorceress warned us that things
aren't always what they seem,

14:11.756 --> 14:12.347
and she was right.

14:12.757 --> 14:15.783
I wonder what other tricks
Skeletor has up his sleeve.

14:16.161 --> 14:17.703
Just wait, He-Man.

14:17.728 --> 14:20.212
Ah, the fun has just begun!

14:29.808 --> 14:32.003
Get them, my little beauties.

14:48.993 --> 14:52.588
So this is the Masters' unstoppable army.

14:52.831 --> 14:55.163
Well, we can take care of
them, right, Battle Cat?

15:20.258 --> 15:24.490
These, these creatures are showing
up faster than we can stop them.

15:34.939 --> 15:37.339
This reminds me of a game
my mother told me about.

15:37.909 --> 15:39.877
It was called: bowling.

15:43.815 --> 15:45.009
Strike.

15:53.892 --> 15:54.551
More?

15:56.227 --> 15:57.421
C'mon, Battle Cat.

15:58.930 --> 16:01.455
That's right, He-Man.
Keep fighting,

16:01.699 --> 16:05.362
but I can put out more
Serpentoids, than you can handle.

16:20.652 --> 16:22.745
Ah! Finally, He-Man.

16:23.054 --> 16:25.249
Even you can't stop us.

16:25.490 --> 16:26.821
I'm not through yet.

16:29.761 --> 16:32.355
He-Man! Over here.

16:33.398 --> 16:36.993
Catch, He-Man.
The Laser Lasso works now.

16:39.737 --> 16:43.867
This won't do you any good
now, He-Man.

16:49.681 --> 16:50.978
Teela, how do I...

16:52.750 --> 16:55.878
Just turn the knob on the right
to increase the force field.

17:13.037 --> 17:15.232
We don't have any time to lose,

17:15.506 --> 17:18.099
and I think they're mass
producing these Serpentoids.

17:18.509 --> 17:21.410
You can stop the production
with your Freeze Ray, Teela.

17:23.848 --> 17:24.872
But where's my father?

17:25.148 --> 17:27.413
He was captured by one
of Beast Man's creatures,

17:27.785 --> 17:30.913
and I'm not leaving until
I find him safe and sound.

17:32.223 --> 17:33.713
Battle Cat, c'mon, let's go!

17:35.026 --> 17:35.924
In here.

17:43.601 --> 17:44.863
Hold it right there, Trap Jaw.

17:50.875 --> 17:51.864
That'll do it!

17:52.143 --> 17:55.203
Not so fast, Teela, you can't stop us.

17:58.916 --> 18:00.406
You idiots!

18:00.785 --> 18:03.879
If I'm not there,
nothing is done right.

18:05.390 --> 18:08.826
Return, Trap Jaw,
and you, Beast Man...

18:09.093 --> 18:11.186
to Snake Mountain. Immediately.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.660
You haven't won yet, He-Man.

18:13.965 --> 18:18.299
Your precious Man-At-Arms is
still in my not-so-safe keeping.

18:18.770 --> 18:19.668
My father?

18:20.337 --> 18:22.202
Now why don't you just try to find him?

18:27.478 --> 18:30.174
This scanner can detect any life force.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.619
I'm picking up something.

18:34.619 --> 18:35.950
That's the mountain.

18:44.662 --> 18:45.594
What's that?

18:46.130 --> 18:49.896
Fools, you've set the
self-destructive mechanism.

18:50.902 --> 18:53.598
It was designed to keep out intruders.

18:53.838 --> 18:56.705
Now it may keep, Man-At-Arms, in.

18:58.943 --> 19:01.207
He-Man, in here.

19:07.752 --> 19:09.344
Over here.

19:10.221 --> 19:11.313
We're coming.

19:17.362 --> 19:19.159
Where's the destruction device?

19:19.397 --> 19:21.297
Right, next to me.

19:40.418 --> 19:42.079
Thank you, He-Man.

19:42.587 --> 19:45.647
Phew, that was a little
too close for comfort.

19:45.723 --> 19:48.359
There's just one more matter to clear up.

19:48.359 --> 19:51.795
I better dismantle what's
left of Skeletor's army.

19:55.867 --> 19:58.961
So, when I got the Lasso to work,
I decided to follow you and He-Man.

20:03.641 --> 20:05.905
Oh no. Not me again.

20:10.114 --> 20:11.308
Hey, what's going on?

20:11.582 --> 20:13.550
I'm sure you wouldn't be interested.

20:13.785 --> 20:15.082
Oh, don't be so sure.

20:15.286 --> 20:18.653
You know, Teela, sometimes things
aren't always what they seem.

20:29.900 --> 20:30.696
In today's story...

20:30.701 --> 20:33.761
I asked my father for permisson
to do something I wanted to do.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.905
When he didn't give it to
me, I did it anyway.

20:36.207 --> 20:39.699
I was lucky. Nothing happened to
me, but it could have.

20:40.010 --> 20:41.841
Now maybe mothers and fathers
aren't always right...

20:42.079 --> 20:44.274
but if they don't always let
us do something we want to do,

20:44.582 --> 20:46.240
there's generally a pretty good reason.

20:46.383 --> 20:48.715
All in all, I think it's
pretty nice to have someone...

20:49.019 --> 20:51.487
who's always trying to
do what's best for us...

20:51.755 --> 20:55.714
And who loves us enought to say 'no' when
it would be much easier to say 'yes'.
