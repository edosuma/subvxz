09:25.000 --> 09:27.480
The reason we came for the loan
in the first place

09:27.560 --> 09:32.327
was because Richie lost $90,000
of our company's money in Las Vegas,

09:32.400 --> 09:34.926
which he then tried to blame on me.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.887
I am really sorry to be hearing all this.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.167
It's not easy for me to say.

09:40.720 --> 09:44.088
Our corporate bylaws have a morals clause

09:44.160 --> 09:46.401

or unethical behavior.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.086

09:53.000 --> 09:54.570
I can get rid of him.

All it takes is a vote by the other partners.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.091
What do you mean?

11:09.680 --> 11:10.761
It was written by...

11:12.240 --> 11:16.529
It was written by Lester Grimes in 1962
while he was still under contract with me.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.489

- Okay, fine, whatever.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.562

11:21.280 --> 11:22.645

11:22.720 --> 11:24.927
What, Lester's? It's the compulsory license.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.731
Only if he ever recorded it,
which he never did because I never let him.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.801
- Jesus Christ.
- Talk to him.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.847
You think he's gonna pass on a payday?

11:29.920 --> 11:32.321

- I'm not so sure he is anymore.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.169
- Hundred?
- I have a call in to Stein for more.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.810

Dropping Indigo. I never sent it.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.643
No, I gave it to you, like, two weeks ago.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.485
Yeah, I know,
but I've been pushing their album.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.449
Me and Jorge,
we've hit every dance club in the city.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.171
- Who the fuck's Jorge?
- I am.

23:24.040 --> 23:26.202
Why would you push the album
if you knew we were dropping them?

23:26.480 --> 23:30.041
<i>That song Kill the Lights, it's great.</i>

23:30.120 --> 23:32.122
We should release it as a single. People dig it.

23:32.200 --> 23:35.090
- You're Murray the K now?
-ls the album charting or not?

23:35.160 --> 23:37.128
I'm telling you, it's like Pizarro going to Peru.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.806

to use it 'cause it's never been recorded.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.931
Well, you and Maury can suck
the permission out of my dick.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.401
Okay, well, that's an interesting proposition,

24:27.480 --> 24:30.165
but how about we pay you instead?

24:31.240 --> 24:32.844
Ten grand to sign over the rights.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.649
- Two and a half points.
- Fuck you.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.167
- Their first fucking record.
- I don't owe them nothing.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.891
- You're their manager.
- So they can get a new one. Different song.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.321
Album's already pressed. 50,000 copies.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.767
- Redo it. You got the money.
- You know that's not gonna happen.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.486
- Then you're shit out of luck.
- Hey, I can release it anyway.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.642
Without your permission, Lester.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.842
You could sue me later
and then end up with shit.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.251

26:25.240 --> 26:26.765
