06:17.878 --> 06:19.079
- So sorry.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.314
I just missed you.

06:21.314 --> 06:22.450
- You're so big.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.751
- That is so mean.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.453
- You know what I mean.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.521
I can't believe my baby
is growing in there.

06:27.521 --> 06:28.889
- Our baby.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.323
What are you doing here?

06:30.323 --> 06:32.092
You weren't supposed to
be here until tonight.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.093
- Surprise.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.096
- Your arm.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.198
- It's really not that bad.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.199
I missed you.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.367
- Missed you, too.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.636
So how's everything
with the baby?

06:42.636 --> 06:43.804
- It's perfect.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.606
The only thing that's
missing is you.

06:45.606 --> 06:46.674
- Here I am.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.244
I see your brother's here.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.513
- Yeah.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.781
Nice.

06:53.781 --> 06:54.682
- Stop it.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.456
- Welcome back.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.359
- I know you missed me.

07:08.462 --> 07:11.431
- I took good care
of both of them.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.801
- Appreciate that.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.972
- Well, now let's
see how you do.

07:18.972 --> 07:19.873
- Tony.

07:21.308 --> 07:25.345
- Just looking out
for my little sister.

07:25.345 --> 07:28.148
- Why don't I make
us some lunch?

07:28.148 --> 07:30.918
I'm so happy that you're back.

07:30.918 --> 07:31.819
- Me too.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.462
Home sweet home.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.189
Here we go, boys.

08:10.858 --> 08:14.127
- So, wanna tell
us what happened.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.028
- Tony.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.531
- It's okay, Steph.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.634
Yeah, there was a sniper.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.606
Took out half the platoon
before we knew what hit us.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.841
Bullets flying everywhere.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.011
Before you know it, I was hit.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.815
Looking around, all I could see

08:34.815 --> 08:37.818
was the bodies laying
around everywhere.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.053
So much blood.

08:42.556 --> 08:43.456
Then,

08:44.692 --> 08:45.593
boom.

08:48.095 --> 08:51.064
That's so mean.

08:51.064 --> 08:54.134
- Luckily it was in the
shoulder and only a flesh wound.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.803
- Lucky guy, it could've
been in the head.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.370
- You know what they say,
what doesn't kill you

08:57.370 --> 08:59.006
makes you stronger.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.514
- Well, you're home now.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.717
So you gotta be a
husband and a father.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.551
Can you handle that, soldier?

09:11.551 --> 09:12.820
All the shit you been
through over there,

09:12.820 --> 09:14.788
this is a lot to handle.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.857
- Tony, it's time to go.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.760
It's all good.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.161
- Okay, I'll go.

09:22.429 --> 09:23.897
Call me if you need anything.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.532
Take care of them.

09:25.532 --> 09:28.101
Don't worry about it.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.212
- I'm so sorry.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.050
What a shithead.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.619
Serve and protect, what a joke.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.389
- I know that he can
be over protective

09:49.389 --> 09:51.291
sometimes.
- Sometimes.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.628
- He's done a lot for us.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.563
- Yeah, I guess.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.131
He's still a dick.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.974
- I'm just really
glad you're home.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.510
- Me too.

10:51.985 --> 10:52.920
- Ryan.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.422
Ryan, stop you're hurting me.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.931
What just happened?

11:05.799 --> 11:07.234
- I don't know.

11:11.839 --> 11:12.740
Ryan.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.560
Hey.
- Jesus.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.666
- Nothing, I couldn't sleep.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.604
I just needed some fresh air.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.172
- Okay.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.242
It's cold, let's go back to bed.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.143
- Yeah.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.117
- Good night, baby.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.454
If you need anything, just
let me know, I'm here for you.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.355
- I know.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.193
- I love you.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.563
- Love you too.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.787
- Daddy's home.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.056
Yeah, he is.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.325
- Good.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.226
Hot mama.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.396
What you making?

17:10.396 --> 17:12.699
- Eggs and bacon the usual.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.637
- It's unusually quiet
around here, don't you think?

17:17.637 --> 17:19.606
Why do you say that?

17:19.606 --> 17:23.443
- I don't know, it just
seems really quiet.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.113
- I guess it's a
quiet neighborhood.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.281
- I don't remember it like that.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.882
Usually there's some
asshole telling us

17:29.882 --> 17:31.951
that we're driving too fast.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.553
- You're talking
about Mr. Draper.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.687
Where is that old fart?

17:34.687 --> 17:36.123
- I actually don't know.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.490
Haven't seen him in
a couple of weeks.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.391
- Good.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.595
- Well, we're out in
the middle of nowhere,

17:42.595 --> 17:45.598
and that's what you get for
having a peaceful environment.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.733
I love it.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.102
- That's all that matters.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.871
- So, what time is
your appointment?

17:51.871 --> 17:52.839
- Noon.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.475
- No, it's okay.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.776
You just stay here and rest up.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.611
Rest is good for the baby.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.012
- If you say so.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.117
Well, you should
probably shower up,

18:04.117 --> 18:08.054
and I'm gonna make us breakfast.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.789
Yes, ma'am.

18:15.962 --> 18:19.599
Two eggs.
There's three of us.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.650
Steph.

18:40.553 --> 18:44.123
Wanna come in and work
on baby number two?

19:18.225 --> 19:20.327
Congratulations
to caller 12 for winning our

19:20.327 --> 19:22.028
$50 gift card prize.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.165
And how about the
weather for us, John?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.000
Well, currently
we're looking at clear skies

19:28.000 --> 19:29.269
with a high of plus 12.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.504
Then cooling down to
a breezy six degrees

19:31.504 --> 19:32.939
with a mix of sun and cloud,

19:32.939 --> 19:35.174
and a 60% chance of showers
later in the weekend.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.476
Well, thank
you for the update.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.410
How about anything for the news?

19:37.410 --> 19:38.545
Anything new and exciting?

19:38.545 --> 19:39.779
Well,
actually, coincidentally

19:39.779 --> 19:40.947
I was watching the
news last night

19:40.947 --> 19:42.582
and there's been a lot of people

19:42.582 --> 19:43.950
with sightings of crop circles.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.184
Crop circles?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.786
Yeah, like
the whole alien thing.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.187
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.356
And a lot of people
have been saying

19:49.356 --> 19:51.791
that they've seen these odd--

20:58.625 --> 20:59.692
- Cute kids.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.594
- Thank you.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.933
- Ryan O'Neil.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.804
- Yeah, right here.

21:11.804 --> 21:12.872
- Follow me.

21:24.250 --> 21:27.153
The doctor will
be right with you.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.871
- Good morning, Ryan
how are you today?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.409
- Sorry, good afternoon.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.577
It's been a busy morning.

21:50.577 --> 21:51.878
How are you?

21:51.878 --> 21:52.845
- I'm good.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.215
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.250
- How's that shoulder
of yours feeling?

21:58.250 --> 21:59.919
- It's pretty good actually.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.854
- Good, well let's take a look.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.255
Can you remove your
shirt for me please?

22:03.255 --> 22:04.156
- Sure.

22:16.436 --> 22:20.440
- Okay, so can you rotate
your shoulder for me?

22:24.143 --> 22:25.144
Okay, good.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.782
- Shoulder's gonna be just fine.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.451
- Well, let's just make
sure everything's working

22:31.451 --> 22:32.752
the way it's supposed to.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.487
- Sounds good to me.

22:37.289 --> 22:40.292
Can I get something
to help me sleep?

22:40.292 --> 22:42.629
Kind of been seeing things.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.999
- What do you mean,
seeing things?

22:46.999 --> 22:49.569
- I don't know, I feel like...

22:51.404 --> 22:53.239
It's hard to explain.

22:54.641 --> 22:57.510
- Well, you have been through
a traumatic time in your life,

22:57.510 --> 22:59.612
and it's changed you, so it's
just gonna take some time

22:59.612 --> 23:01.448
to process everything.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.783
- That's what they keep saying.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.487
- She's good.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.689
She really got that glow.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.390
- Your baby's
gonna be here soon.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.692
I'm really excited
for both of you.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.261
- Hopefully sooner than later.

23:16.295 --> 23:17.864
- You don't seem excited
about that at all.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.098
- It's not that.

23:19.098 --> 23:22.068
Excited to meet
the baby, it's just

23:22.935 --> 23:25.505
I think I'm gonna go back.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.174
- No, not yet.

23:29.308 --> 23:30.910
- Will you be here for
the birth of your child?

23:30.910 --> 23:32.178
- Of course.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.680
I got six months.

23:34.747 --> 23:38.451
- Okay, well you can
put your shirt back on.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.756
I really think you should be

23:43.756 --> 23:45.157
communicating that
with your wife,

23:45.157 --> 23:48.628
as long as it's still
something you wanna do.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.996
You're really lucky
to be alive, Ryan.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.464
You just need some time to heal.

23:51.464 --> 23:52.832
- I'm healing just fine.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.433
- I'm not talking
about your body.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.103
I'm talking about up here.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.204
Come back for Friday.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.438
Just give it some time

23:59.438 --> 24:02.542
and don't make any
final decisions yet.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.012
Get ready to be a dad.

24:15.922 --> 24:20.326
- You don't have to do
this, put the gun away.

24:20.326 --> 24:23.696
They said board up your windows.

24:23.696 --> 24:26.666
Whatever those
things are, they die.

24:28.334 --> 24:31.203
- They die.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.304
- And then they come back.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.007
And they rip your family apart.

24:37.343 --> 24:38.244
- Ryan,

24:40.212 --> 24:41.280
is that you?

27:06.926 --> 27:07.827
- You,

27:09.595 --> 27:12.064
how could I forget about you?

27:13.532 --> 27:14.533
Good times.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.061
Hey.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.163
- How long have you
been out here for?

28:17.163 --> 28:18.765
- I just got back.

28:18.765 --> 28:21.633
Just having a look at the boat.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.402
Anybody live around
here anymore?

28:23.402 --> 28:25.371
- Why do you keep
on saying that?

28:25.371 --> 28:27.273
- Just seems so quiet.

28:29.909 --> 28:30.743
Everything alright?

28:30.743 --> 28:31.844
You doing okay?

28:31.844 --> 28:34.580
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just
tired.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.951
- I'm thinking we
should sell the boat.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.420
Why?

28:41.420 --> 28:43.489
- Give us some more
money for the baby.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.924
- You love that thing.

28:44.924 --> 28:45.825
- I do.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.495
- Well, we don't have to
worry about that right now.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.730
Just a thought.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.132
- Okay, come on.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.148
- Good morning.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.549
- Morning.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.822
- I don't know,
I must've passed out.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.962
Ryan, I'm talking to you.

32:09.962 --> 32:11.263
- Sorry.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.764
Yeah, I'm hungry.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.935
We need to talk.

32:19.972 --> 32:22.908
- Oh, great, look who's
here for his laundry.

32:22.908 --> 32:23.809
- Shit.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.745
I totally forgot.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.186
Forgot what?

32:35.287 --> 32:37.323
- I have an ultrasound.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.357
- You forgot.

32:38.357 --> 32:39.992
- I did baby brain.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.530
I forgot.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.369
- I can take her, she's my wife.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.873
Why didn't she tell me
about the appointment?

32:54.873 --> 32:56.375
- Maybe you should ask her.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.276
- I will.

33:00.746 --> 33:03.215
- If you ever hurt my sister,

33:03.215 --> 33:04.616
I will kill you.

33:06.718 --> 33:09.621
- You know right
where to find me.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.560
- Steph, let's go.

33:20.699 --> 33:21.600
- Hey,

33:22.901 --> 33:24.736
why didn't you tell me
about the ultrasound?

33:24.736 --> 33:26.438
- I forgot.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.806
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.007
- You didn't wanna tell me.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.642
Why wouldn't you
want me to be there?

33:30.642 --> 33:32.778
- I do want you to be there.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.613
But he's been here
the whole time.

33:34.613 --> 33:37.383
I can't just tell
him not to come now.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.518
Why don't you just come with us?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.353
- Whatever, I don't
wanna interrupt

33:41.353 --> 33:43.322
your brother's
time with my baby.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.956
- Stop being like that.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.492
- And stop doing
his fucking laundry.

33:46.492 --> 33:49.995
- Hey, what's the
hold up? We gotta go.

33:49.995 --> 33:51.697
- I'm coming.

33:51.697 --> 33:52.864
Why don't you just come with us?

33:52.864 --> 33:55.834
- I'm not going anywhere
with this douche.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.503
- Don't be like that.

33:57.503 --> 34:00.439
He's the only person I
have when you're not here.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.340
- Fine.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.176
I'm not gonna let him
stir shit up between us.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.744
- Okay.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.097
Tony, I cannot wait to
get this thing out of me.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.431
I bet.

34:29.835 --> 34:34.039
I feel like
I'm in a fat guy's suit.

34:34.039 --> 34:35.241
You're
gonna regret that

34:35.241 --> 34:37.409
when the kid starts
running around.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.279
- Nope, I don't think I will.

34:40.279 --> 34:41.612
Thank you.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.748
- Welcome.
- Oh, my god.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.317
- Yep.

35:04.570 --> 35:05.971
Tony, you need to get a new car.

35:05.971 --> 35:07.473
- Why, it's fine.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.007
- Let's just take mine.

35:09.007 --> 35:10.476
- Look, I got this, sis.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.481
See, told you.
This little girl's

35:15.481 --> 35:19.185
still got a lot of
life left in her.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.702
The
community has been baffled

35:36.702 --> 35:39.871
by what some are calling an
out of this world experience

35:39.871 --> 35:43.509
as an unusual amount of crop
circles are appearing in fields

35:43.509 --> 35:45.511
and local farmer's crops.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.779
Local authorities
say this is simply

35:47.779 --> 35:50.115
just a bunch of kids
playing a harmless prank.

35:50.115 --> 35:52.551
Well, experts say
based on the number of

35:52.551 --> 35:54.220
crop circles appearing

35:54.220 --> 35:56.522
and the geographical
distance between

35:56.522 --> 35:58.590
place of appearances and time,

35:58.590 --> 36:02.160
that this cannot be
physically done by one...

37:53.772 --> 37:54.973
- Hello.

37:54.973 --> 37:58.243
Hey, I'll
be home soon, okay.

37:58.243 --> 37:59.811
- All right.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.413
Are you okay?

38:01.413 --> 38:04.783
- Yeah, I'm just
trying to relax.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.217
How'd everything go?

38:06.217 --> 38:08.920
I can't believe
the baby's almost here.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.556
It's so cute, Ryan.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.725
I can't wait to
find out its sex.

38:13.725 --> 38:14.893
- Me neither.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.996
I'll see you soon.

38:17.996 --> 38:18.897
- Bye.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.684
- Thanks for taking me.

38:38.684 --> 38:39.885
- Stay safe.

38:39.885 --> 38:42.588
Call me if you need me, okay?

38:42.588 --> 38:46.358
- You need to stop
being a jerk to him.

38:46.358 --> 38:50.028
He's my husband and
the father of my child.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.165
- I know, I know.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.034
Look, I'll talk to him.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.669
- Come inside and
talk to him now.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.538
- I can't, I gotta go.

38:59.538 --> 39:02.708
- Please just come inside
and get it over with.

39:02.708 --> 39:03.975
- Steph.

39:03.975 --> 39:04.876
- Please.

39:10.382 --> 39:11.850
- All right.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.685
- Thank you.
- If it means that much to you.

39:13.685 --> 39:14.586
- Yes.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.215
I forgot my keys.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.790
Tony's here so you two can chat.

39:51.790 --> 39:52.791
- Lucky me.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.197
- Yeah, I wanna apologize.

40:01.366 --> 40:03.435
- I'll leave you two be.

40:04.536 --> 40:07.238
- She put you up to
this, didn't she?

40:07.238 --> 40:08.640
- Yeah, she did.

40:10.008 --> 40:13.144
But I wanna see her
happy and you're home,

40:13.144 --> 40:14.880
so I gotta back off.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.152
- Look, I don't like
you, I really don't,

40:21.152 --> 40:23.922
but I'm willing to try
for Stephanie's sake.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.423
- That's not an apology.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.725
- Tough luck, buddy.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.326
It's about as close
as you're gonna get.

40:28.326 --> 40:29.661
- Fine with me.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.800
- So glad you guys
figured things out.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.803
- Yeah, we're just perfect.

40:37.803 --> 40:40.305
- Yeah, one big happy family.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.208
- Thanks for coming.

41:14.806 --> 41:18.176
I am so glad you guys
figured that out.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.210
I bet.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.179
- He's trying.

41:21.179 --> 41:22.413
- Yeah, right.

41:23.782 --> 41:26.284
- Oh, no I don't think
his car's starting again.

41:28.219 --> 41:29.087
- Ryan.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.791
- Come on baby, spin
for daddy, come on.

41:36.662 --> 41:38.463
I'll buy you premium.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.002
Just kidding.

41:45.436 --> 41:46.504
- Thank god.

42:29.414 --> 42:31.549
- Yeah, that sounds good.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.924
I gotta take this.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.191
- Well, I'm gonna get into

42:40.191 --> 42:42.193
something a little
more comfortable.

42:42.193 --> 42:44.362
- Sounds good. I won't be long.

42:44.362 --> 42:46.264
- Okay, better not be.

42:53.872 --> 42:55.206
- Hey, man.

42:55.206 --> 42:56.842
Sorry my phone's almost dead.

42:56.842 --> 43:00.879
Why haven't I
heard back from you yet?

43:00.879 --> 43:03.915
- Things have just been crazy
busy with the baby and all.

43:03.915 --> 43:05.851
Did you tell her yet?

43:05.851 --> 43:07.085
- No, not yet.

43:08.386 --> 43:11.690
Be a man
and talk to her.

43:11.690 --> 43:14.592
It's never gonna be easy.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.161
- I know I just...

43:17.395 --> 43:18.864
I'm just waiting for the
right time to tell her.

43:18.864 --> 43:23.534
Just trust me
it's not an easy thing to do,

43:23.534 --> 43:25.003
but hey, I did it.

43:28.807 --> 43:30.375
- I don't wanna hurt her.

43:30.375 --> 43:34.980
Okay, well hopefully
I'll see you in a few months.

43:34.980 --> 43:35.847
- Yeah.

43:36.748 --> 43:38.016
Yeah,
talk to you la--

44:04.642 --> 44:05.610
- Steph.

44:07.612 --> 44:09.514
How could you?
What about the baby?

44:09.514 --> 44:11.850
- Look, it's not for a while.

44:14.419 --> 44:15.721
My brother was right about you.

44:15.721 --> 44:17.255
- Your brother is
a fucking asshole,

44:17.255 --> 44:19.390
and this isn't about him.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.361
- If you leave,

44:25.230 --> 44:26.664
I want a divorce.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.700
- You're over reacting.

44:31.236 --> 44:33.538
Ryan, you've changed.

44:33.538 --> 44:34.840
You don't see it, but I do,

44:34.840 --> 44:36.274
and it scares me.

44:37.675 --> 44:38.609
- Come here.

44:38.609 --> 44:40.979
- No, don't fucking touch me.

44:40.979 --> 44:42.948
- Look, I'm trying here.

44:44.382 --> 44:46.852
I know things haven't been
quite like they used to.

44:46.852 --> 44:49.955
But we really need
to talk about this.

44:49.955 --> 44:50.856
- Fine.

44:52.157 --> 44:53.759
When are you leaving?

44:53.759 --> 44:54.893
- Six months.

44:57.695 --> 44:58.864
- Six months.

45:07.438 --> 45:09.941
- I'll take care
of you both of you.

45:09.941 --> 45:13.378
- How can you do that
if you're not even here?

45:13.378 --> 45:14.645
- This is who I am.

45:14.645 --> 45:17.182
You knew that when
you married me.

45:17.182 --> 45:20.085
- Yeah, well things
are different.

45:21.352 --> 45:23.088
My baby needs its father.

45:23.088 --> 45:26.892
- I will always be there
for our baby, always.

45:26.892 --> 45:31.129
- Ryan, you almost died,
you even said it yourself.

45:32.597 --> 45:34.332
You need to wake up.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.970
It's not that easy.

45:42.207 --> 45:44.609
- Don't leave me again.

45:44.609 --> 45:47.813
Just don't make
a decision, okay.

45:47.813 --> 45:51.883
If I can't change your
mind, maybe the baby can.

46:10.335 --> 46:11.236
- No.

46:12.670 --> 46:14.472
- I'll be right back.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.965
You heard that, right?

46:39.965 --> 46:40.866
- Yeah.

47:00.418 --> 47:04.589
- I've been seeing and hearing
things since I been back.

47:07.558 --> 47:10.862
- Doors being opened
after I lock them.

47:12.864 --> 47:14.599
- Me too.

47:14.599 --> 47:16.334
- Yesterday.

47:18.803 --> 47:22.941
- It felt like somebody
was watching me.

47:22.941 --> 47:24.275
- I saw someone
standing in the hallway

47:24.275 --> 47:26.311
when you were sleeping.

47:27.712 --> 47:29.114
- Searched the entire house

47:29.114 --> 47:31.282
I couldn't find anything.

47:33.018 --> 47:35.153
There was an abandoned
SUV down the road.

47:35.153 --> 47:36.654
It had no plates.

47:37.989 --> 47:39.190
- Oh, my god.

47:40.391 --> 47:41.859
Ryan, I'm scared.

47:41.859 --> 47:43.228
- Stay here.

47:44.329 --> 47:46.064
Where are you going?

47:48.333 --> 47:50.101
- To get my gun.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.388
- The front door.

48:23.801 --> 48:24.702
- No.

48:28.039 --> 48:31.442
- I don't know.

48:33.911 --> 48:35.346
- Calm down.

48:35.346 --> 48:38.749
Probably just a bunch of
punk-ass kids messing around.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.818
- You said that there
was someone in the house.

48:40.818 --> 48:44.822
- I was half asleep
I could've dreamt it.

48:44.822 --> 48:47.692
I'm just gonna go out there
and fire off a warning shot.

48:47.692 --> 48:49.460
- You can't leave me
in here by myself.

48:49.460 --> 48:51.196
I'm coming with you.

48:53.764 --> 48:56.234
- Stay close.
- Okay.

49:11.149 --> 49:14.285
- Enough already,
quit fucking around.

49:16.187 --> 49:17.855
I will fuck you up.

49:21.492 --> 49:25.130
- Oh, my god, Ryan,
there's somebody over there.

49:28.533 --> 49:30.101
- Cover your ears.

49:34.272 --> 49:35.773
- We gotta go inside
and call the cops.

49:35.773 --> 49:36.674
- Go, now.

50:02.867 --> 50:03.768
Take it.

50:06.937 --> 50:08.239
- Just in case.

50:10.341 --> 50:12.510
- I'm calling my brother.

50:41.272 --> 50:43.708
- Why don't they
just leave us alone?

50:50.081 --> 50:51.716
It's dead.

51:02.827 --> 51:05.830
There's someone
out there with a mask on.

51:08.466 --> 51:10.401
- I'm trying, it's not working.

51:10.401 --> 51:11.469
- Calm down.

51:12.837 --> 51:14.472
- Oh, fuck.

51:14.472 --> 51:15.740
Where are you going?

51:15.740 --> 51:18.943
- I'm not gonna let some
punk kids fuck with us.

51:21.346 --> 51:22.647
- Get that phone working

51:22.647 --> 51:25.583
and call the cops,
not your brother.

51:25.583 --> 51:28.353
Anyone comes near you,
you start swinging.

51:28.353 --> 51:30.421
- Oh, my god don't leave me.

51:30.421 --> 51:31.922
- I'm just gonna be on the
other side of the door.

51:31.922 --> 51:33.991
Lock the door behind me.

51:50.841 --> 51:54.078
- Ryan, there's
somebody behind you.

51:54.078 --> 51:56.747
There's someone behind you.

52:03.554 --> 52:05.523
Why are you doing this?

52:08.626 --> 52:10.361
Just leave us alone.

52:49.334 --> 52:51.736
Oh, god Tony, please pick up.

53:14.158 --> 53:15.493
- Hey, sis what's up.

53:15.493 --> 53:16.394
- Tony.

53:18.162 --> 53:19.364
- Steph.

53:19.364 --> 53:23.601
- Please you've gotta
help us.

53:23.601 --> 53:24.935
- Steph, no hang on.

53:24.935 --> 53:25.903
Hang on I'm coming.

53:25.903 --> 53:27.438
Fuck.

53:27.438 --> 53:28.339
Fuck.

53:33.210 --> 53:34.912
No, no, no not now come on.

53:34.912 --> 53:36.013
Come on, fuck.

53:36.881 --> 53:38.082
Fuck, hang on.

53:38.082 --> 53:38.983
Fuck.

54:21.959 --> 54:24.028
- Ryan, they raped me.

54:33.137 --> 54:34.038
The baby.

54:45.550 --> 54:47.284
They're coming back.

54:53.758 --> 54:56.260
I'm gonna get us
out of here, okay.

54:56.260 --> 54:58.929
I'm gonna get us out of this.

55:06.704 --> 55:07.772
Ryan.

55:07.772 --> 55:09.273
Ryan.

55:09.273 --> 55:10.240
- Fuck you.

55:11.108 --> 55:12.009
Fuck you.

55:13.478 --> 55:15.913
You stay away from her.

55:15.913 --> 55:17.815
Stay the fuck away from her.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.417
I'll fucking kill you.

55:19.417 --> 55:21.652
I'll kill all of you.

55:21.652 --> 55:22.553
Fuck you.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.334
No.

55:37.334 --> 55:38.235
No.

55:41.506 --> 55:42.940
Don't you fucking touch her.

55:42.940 --> 55:44.509
Take me.

55:44.509 --> 55:47.077
Take me, you fucking asshole.

55:51.916 --> 55:52.817
No, no.

56:16.707 --> 56:17.608
Fuck you.

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:07.972
No.

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:14.311
No.

01:00:18.182 --> 01:00:19.083
I'm sorry.

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:27.424
I'm sorry.

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:28.558
I'm so sorry.

01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:43.067
Steph!

01:01:43.067 --> 01:01:45.102
Steph, are you okay?

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:48.238
Drop the bat.

01:01:51.575 --> 01:01:53.143
Where's Stephanie?

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:55.312
Steph.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.782
Say something, you fuck.

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:08.826
Where is Stephanie?

01:02:10.928 --> 01:02:12.062
- She's gone.

01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:15.800
- She's dead.

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:20.337
Listen to me.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:21.806
People came here.

01:02:23.307 --> 01:02:24.541
They were wearing masks.

01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:27.111
- Why would I believe
anything you say?

01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:30.680
Three seconds to tell
me where my sister is!

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.482
One.
- It wasn't me.

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:34.418
- Two.
- It wasn't me.

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:36.420
Listen to me, you stupid fuck.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.956
There's something else here.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:42.426
- Why the fuck
would I believe you?

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:44.995
- There's something else here.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.253
That was my nephew.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.689
I was gonna be an uncle.

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:19.596
Don't even fucking move.

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:22.933
Oh, god.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:26.937
It wasn't me.

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:30.040
- You remember what
I promised you?

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.111
If you ever hurt them, I
would fucking kill you.

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:36.146
- Go ahead.

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:25.629
It's okay, buddy.

01:04:27.664 --> 01:04:29.499
Uncle Tony's got you.

01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:06.997
Hi, this is Officer Cole.

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:14.738
I need units to 555
River Ridge Road.

01:06:14.738 --> 01:06:16.040
Just send them.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.545
I'm so sorry, Stephanie.
