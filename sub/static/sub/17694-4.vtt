WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:07.606
What do people think of
when they think of Germany?

00:07.608 --> 00:10.676
ALL: Uh...

00:10.678 --> 00:12.711
The Holocau--

00:12.713 --> 00:15.514
Hazelnut omelets! Exactly!

00:15.516 --> 00:18.550
And the next batch is almost...

00:18.552 --> 00:20.719
Oh, God.
The Roomba heard that.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.554
Nobody move!

00:22.556 --> 00:25.190
(Roomba whirs)

00:31.298 --> 00:32.998
(all sigh)

00:33.000 --> 00:35.334
And none of us remember
buying that?

00:35.336 --> 00:37.870
So there's a new Web program
called Facebook.

00:37.872 --> 00:41.006
It's the most efficient way
to wish people happy birthday.

00:41.008 --> 00:42.841
(all chuckle)

00:42.843 --> 00:44.309
What?
Why are you snickering?

00:44.311 --> 00:45.811
Dad, Facebook's, like,

00:45.813 --> 00:47.479
the oldest website
in the world.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.581
Francine,
you missed a couple hazelnuts.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.083
Some went under the fridge.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.152
I<i> know</i> some went under
the fridge, Klaus.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.320
That's why I'm sweeping
under the fridge.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.655
I'd like to join Facebook,

00:56.657 --> 00:58.023
but my work computer
won't let me.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.825
I hit the "enter" key
as hard as I could,

00:59.827 --> 01:01.193
but even that
didn't work.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.828
Can you have a look
at my "enter" key?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.063
Dad, your keyboard's fine.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.731
I mean,
you broke your "enter" key,

01:05.733 --> 01:07.733
but that's not the problem.
There's probably a firewall.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.601
Just download Ultrasurf,
unzip the software,

01:09.603 --> 01:11.270
put the executable
on a flash drive --

01:11.272 --> 01:13.072
Wait, let's back up a bit.

01:13.074 --> 01:15.374
Where does my computer go
when I'm asleep?

01:15.376 --> 01:17.042
Okay, not to be a nag,

01:17.044 --> 01:20.746
but I think if you just sweep
with less of a wide motion

01:20.748 --> 01:22.414
and more of a --
-You know what, Klaus?

01:22.416 --> 01:25.050
If you want your precious
hazelnuts, you sweep 'em up.

01:25.052 --> 01:28.187
Ew, we all heard that.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.622
Tense.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.724
Dad, why don't you just
bring me to work with you?

01:32.726 --> 01:34.460
I'll set your computer up.

01:34.462 --> 01:37.262
Hmm. You hanging around
all my badass colleagues.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.797
I don't know.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.466
Dad, I won't embarrass you.

01:40.468 --> 01:43.235
You know what?
Maybe it'll be good for you.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.903
Yes!
You'll wear pants.

01:44.905 --> 01:47.439
I have the perfect pair
of khakis from...

01:47.441 --> 01:49.374
Petite Sophisticate.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.543
(sighs)
Of course you do.

01:51.545 --> 01:54.813
Awesome! I get to miss
the rope climb in gym class.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.950
Not only are my arms too weak
to pull myself up,

01:57.952 --> 01:59.651
but I don't like the feeling
the rope makes

01:59.653 --> 02:01.086
as it rubs
against my genitals...

02:01.088 --> 02:03.222
Until I<i> do</i> like it.

02:03.224 --> 02:07.493
Steve, wait!
You haven't tried --

02:07.495 --> 02:12.598
Okay, Klaus, I will try
one of your hazel whatevers.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.601
Mmm! This is really good.
What's in it?

02:15.603 --> 02:18.003
Hazelnut, butter, eggs,
veal, milk.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.771
(spits)
I use whole milk.
Some people --

02:19.773 --> 02:22.274
Wait. Veal?!
There's meat in this?

02:22.276 --> 02:25.144
For thickening.
You know what they say --

02:25.146 --> 02:26.645
you can't make

02:26.647 --> 02:29.581
<i> hazelnussomeletten</i>
without<i> kinderkuhfleische.</i>

02:29.583 --> 02:32.784
Klaus! I haven't eaten meat
in over a year!

02:32.786 --> 02:34.586
(gagging, coughing)

02:34.588 --> 02:37.589
How do you like yours,
Roger?

02:37.591 --> 02:40.159
(Roomba whirring)
Ah, it's great, it's great.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.661
¶¶

02:42.663 --> 02:45.364
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:45.366 --> 02:48.767
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

02:48.769 --> 02:51.837
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

02:51.839 --> 02:56.175
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

02:58.012 --> 03:01.146
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

03:01.148 --> 03:03.615
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

03:03.617 --> 03:04.950
Aah!

03:06.554 --> 03:10.122
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

03:12.660 --> 03:14.193
Wow, this is cool.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.795
Dad, you think I could be
in the C.I.A. someday?

03:16.797 --> 03:18.530
I don't know, son.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.199
The C.I.A. is all about guys
who can do stuff like this.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.567
(gasps, groans)

03:21.569 --> 03:23.302
Whoa, that was awesome!

03:23.304 --> 03:25.971
(chuckles)
Jim is an old friend.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.707
(raspy voice) It's Carl.
(gasps)

03:31.045 --> 03:34.546
You see what
those jackoffs did?

03:34.548 --> 03:35.914
They've blocked my view!

03:35.916 --> 03:37.749
It's a strong word,
but it's appropriate.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.318
Those jackoffs!

03:39.320 --> 03:40.919
Who?
Who are the jackoffs?

03:40.921 --> 03:45.357
Our number one rival --
the National Security Agency.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.192
Spy on this, nerds!

03:47.194 --> 03:48.994
(window squeaks)

03:48.996 --> 03:50.929
Aren't you guys
on the same team?

03:50.931 --> 03:53.398
Steve, let me show you
an informative film.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.866
MAN:
<i> The C.I.A. began as</i>

03:54.868 --> 03:56.535
<i> the Office</i>
<i> of Strategic Services.</i>

03:56.537 --> 03:58.237
STAN (lowered voice):
Recognize the voice?

03:58.239 --> 03:59.838
<i> ...founded by</i>
<i> "Wild Bill" Donovan</i>

03:59.840 --> 04:02.274
<i> whose courage</i>
<i> and overall badass-ery</i>

04:02.276 --> 04:03.709
<i> helped win World War II.</i>

04:03.711 --> 04:07.079
Have you figured it out?
It's a famous actor.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.780
"Sling Blade"?

04:08.782 --> 04:11.350
<i> He was everything</i>
<i> a C.I.A. agent should be --</i>

04:11.352 --> 04:13.752
<i> a brave,</i>
<i> big-chinned tough guy.</i>

04:13.754 --> 04:15.387
STEVE:
Oh, it's Billy Bob Thornton.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.855
STAN: Yeah! Couple of
the guys got to meet him.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.390
They said
he was pretty cool.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.859
<i> And though</i>
<i> we've had our failures...</i>

04:23.197 --> 04:25.430
<i> ...we've won</i>
<i> our nation's trust,</i>

04:25.432 --> 04:27.399
<i> and we kept</i>
<i> that bastard Fidel Castro</i>

04:27.401 --> 04:29.434
<i> from getting his hands</i>
<i> on America.</i>

04:29.436 --> 04:32.137
<i> Then someone decided</i>
<i> the American taxpayers</i>

04:32.139 --> 04:34.740
<i> should foot the bill</i>
<i> for more government,</i>

04:34.742 --> 04:37.876
<i> and the National Security</i>
<i> Agency was born.</i>

04:37.878 --> 04:41.280
<i> They secretly monitor</i>
<i> all kinds of communication,</i>

04:41.282 --> 04:44.583
<i> including the phone calls</i>
<i> of American citizens.</i>

04:44.585 --> 04:46.451
<i> We fight over how much</i>
<i> of the Federal Budget</i>

04:46.453 --> 04:48.120
<i> we should each get.</i>

04:48.122 --> 04:51.323
Last year, those jackoffs
cost us a Ping-Pong table.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.792
Now our game room
only has four games.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.295
When I grow up, I wanna work
here with you, dad.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.230
(scoffs) Not if you're sleeping
on the double bank.

04:58.232 --> 05:02.634
All right. 1 to 9.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.107
(sniffles) Sorry, toilet.

05:09.109 --> 05:12.144
I know you've been a vegetarian
as long as I have.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.979
Oh, enough.
(toilet flushes)

05:13.981 --> 05:17.182
Be honest. It was delicious
coming up, wasn't it, Hayley?

05:17.184 --> 05:20.819
What? No! I --
I'm a committed vegetarian.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.854
Wasn't it, Hayley?

05:22.856 --> 05:25.490
Fine, fine!
It was delicious!

05:25.492 --> 05:27.759
Listen, it's great that
you're a vegetarian.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.661
But you know that movie
"The Purge"?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.129
Is that the movie where
those girls go shopping?

05:31.131 --> 05:33.098
No, Hayley, you're thinking
of "The Splurge,"

05:33.100 --> 05:34.433
my unproduced screenplay,

05:34.435 --> 05:35.767
and I told you
not to speak of it

05:35.769 --> 05:39.171
because people steal
great ideas.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.640
What you need is
a vegetarian purge --

05:41.642 --> 05:44.209
one day a year
when you go crazy on meat.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.712
No. That violates
all the principles --

05:46.714 --> 05:48.046
(faucet squeaks)

05:48.048 --> 05:51.316
(imitates water gushing)

05:51.318 --> 05:53.218
Think it over.
I'll be in your bath.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.120
I'm not actually gonna
clean myself.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.556
I just like to sit on the drain
while it empties.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.592
Now you share something
crazy about you.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.198
Okay, I culled your bloatware,
disabled running services.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.167
Did you know you were still
using Netscape Navigator?

06:09.169 --> 06:10.502
I use these!

06:10.504 --> 06:13.638
Time for lunch, Smith.
Ah, your son.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.807
Put her there, young man.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.243
Mr. Bullock, can I come to
lunch with you guys?

06:18.245 --> 06:20.011
Hmm,
with that limp handshake?

06:20.013 --> 06:21.913
Strength's not my speciality,
but --

06:21.915 --> 06:24.816
yes, I'm not sure you should
come with us to Applebee's.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.986
We have a reputation to
uphold with our waitress, Trish.

06:27.988 --> 06:31.656
She's a single mother
with sass to spare!

06:31.658 --> 06:33.225
Coming, Smith?

06:33.227 --> 06:36.728
Or do you have plans
with Edward Sissyhands here?

06:38.332 --> 06:42.401
Steve will be good here.
You still have work to do.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.172
Sorry about my goofball son,
sir.
(elevator bell dings)

06:47.174 --> 06:48.540
His handshake
grosses me out, too.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.810
Not exactly C.I.A. material.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.885
You convinced me.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.020
About what?
Baths make me forgetful.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.456
That I might as well
eat meat today.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.692
I still love it,
and I really miss it.

07:07.694 --> 07:11.797
For the next 24 hours,
Hayley Smith is a carnivore.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.965
I want to eat
a cheeseburger.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.001
Ow! Too hard.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.573
Stupid dad.
Not C.I.A. material?

07:21.575 --> 07:23.742
So what if I can't shake
a hand right?

07:23.744 --> 07:25.911
Let's see what happens when
I refuse to update your Adobe.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.212
No, no, that's too much.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.747
Every Adobe update is critical

07:28.749 --> 07:30.715
and should be
installed immediately.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.317
But stupid Dad!

07:32.319 --> 07:33.819
(computer bloops)

07:35.422 --> 07:37.656
Who's watching me?
(computer bloops)

07:41.328 --> 07:45.197
(cellphone blooping)

07:49.503 --> 07:51.069
Who are you?

07:51.071 --> 07:53.438
A guy who knows that
Amanda Duquette digs you.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.174
And no shame in that.
She's a solid six.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.344
Sixes and fives --
that's where the bargains are.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.745
How do you know
about Amanda?

08:00.747 --> 08:02.147
Oh, sorry. I'm Nat.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.649
I work for
the National Security Agency.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.986
We saw what you were doing
with your dad's computer,

08:07.988 --> 08:11.256
and we think you, Steve Smith,
are N.S.A. material.

08:11.258 --> 08:15.093
Really? Hey, do you ever listen
to my conversations with Snot?

08:15.095 --> 08:16.628
(scoffs)
We're the N.S.A.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.930
we got better things to do
than listen

08:18.932 --> 08:20.799
to two confused kids
flirt with each other.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.868
(chuckles) What a relief.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.539
(birds chirping)

08:27.541 --> 08:29.975
Your dad ditched you to go
to Applebee's with his friends.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.610
How'd you know that?

08:31.612 --> 08:37.115
We're the N.S.A. We know
who goes to Applebee's.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.483
See, we don't learn stuff

08:38.485 --> 08:39.985
the dumb,
old-fashioned C.I.A. way.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.620
We use our heads here.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.522
Come on.
Let me show you a movie.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.891
I'm watching a lot
of movies today.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.559
MAN:<i> World War II</i>
<i> wasn't won by jocks.</i>

08:47.561 --> 08:50.962
<i> It was won by nerds.</i>

08:50.964 --> 08:52.564
<i> We built the first computers</i>

08:52.566 --> 08:55.834
<i> and broke the Japanese</i>
<i> and German codes.</i>

08:55.836 --> 08:58.303
STEVE: Now, this one I got.
That's George Takei.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.505
<i> A single N.S.A. computer</i>

09:00.507 --> 09:04.209
<i> does more than</i>
<i> a hundred C.I.A. agents.</i>

09:04.211 --> 09:07.078
<i> We monitor</i>
<i> the world's communications.</i>

09:07.080 --> 09:11.516
<i> If you're talking,</i>
<i> the N.S.A. is listening.</i>

09:11.518 --> 09:12.984
<i>That's what keeps America safe.</i>

09:12.986 --> 09:14.753
(crunching)
That was George Takei.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.421
Yeah, I said that already.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.823
Sorry, I can't hear anything
when I'm munching my corns.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.259
(crunches)

09:21.261 --> 09:22.694
Mmm! (crunching)

09:22.696 --> 09:25.096
Oh! Ohh!

09:25.098 --> 09:27.899
Oh, I'm so disgusted
with myself,

09:27.901 --> 09:30.435
but I can't stop
eating this.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.337
What did I say?
You would love it.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.039
And what happened?
You love it!

09:34.041 --> 09:35.941
Oh, we're not stopping here,
Roger.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.410
If I'm having a meat day,
I'm going all the way.

09:38.412 --> 09:41.179
I want to get weird.
You mean...

09:41.181 --> 09:43.915
Roger,
take me to Koreatown.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.217
Take you? I mean,
can we just go to Koreatown?

09:46.219 --> 09:48.353
What's gonna happen?
I'm gonna be driving,

09:48.355 --> 09:50.055
and you're gonna sit
in the back?

09:50.057 --> 09:52.424
I'm glad your son
didn't ruin our lunch.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.060
It would've revolted me
to see his limp wrist

09:55.062 --> 09:56.895
holding up
a chicken tender.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.363
And Trish!
What would Trish think?

09:58.365 --> 09:59.898
Arm strength
isn't his thing.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.900
Steve will find his thing,
I don't know,

10:01.902 --> 10:03.535
working on a computer
someplace, like...

10:03.537 --> 10:05.103
¶ Doop be doop be doop ¶

10:05.105 --> 10:08.073
(laughs)
Nerds are like that.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.608
<i>¶ Doop be doop be doop ¶</i>
<i> (laughs)</i>

10:09.610 --> 10:11.543
(gasps)
That's not how I talk!

10:11.545 --> 10:13.712
I don't say...
¶ Doop be doop be doop ¶

10:13.714 --> 10:16.147
You guys are watching them
all the time?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.816
Yeah, the more dirt
we get on them,

10:17.818 --> 10:19.551
the more of their budget
we can take.

10:19.553 --> 10:21.252
We've been trying to get on
to your dad's computer,

10:21.254 --> 10:22.887
but we can't figure out
where he keeps his files.

10:22.889 --> 10:25.824
<i> (laughter)</i>
<i> ¶ Doop be doop be doop ¶</i>

10:25.826 --> 10:27.392
How is he still doing it?

10:27.394 --> 10:29.694
And how is he still
getting laughs?!

10:34.167 --> 10:36.668
There you are. Hey,
sorry about lunch, buddy.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.603
But thanks
for setting up Facebook.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.238
Facebook...on!

10:40.240 --> 10:44.409
Notify my friends of
my many accomplishments...on!

10:44.411 --> 10:46.277
I need to take
your disks, okay?

10:46.279 --> 10:50.415
To get them...
digitally cleaned.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.317
Should I get the whole
computer cleaned?

10:52.319 --> 10:53.685
Would that make it
happier?

10:53.687 --> 10:56.021
No.
It doesn't feel anything.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.657
Sometimes I wish
I was a computer.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.026
You sound a little ominous,
Steve.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.427
Is everything okay?

11:02.429 --> 11:03.962
Yes, everything's fine.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.898
Cool!

11:08.301 --> 11:09.868
(squeaks)

11:09.870 --> 11:11.770
Eat it, Hayley.
Eat it!

11:11.772 --> 11:13.872
(shudders)

11:15.175 --> 11:19.177
(groaning)

11:19.179 --> 11:20.979
(slurps and gulps)

11:20.981 --> 11:22.614
Oh, my God.

11:22.616 --> 11:24.716
I could feel him fighting
all the way down my throat.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.518
He did not wanna die.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.354
Hayley,
what's your wildest fantasy?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.022
I've been kidnapped
by three African guys,

11:31.024 --> 11:32.657
and while
the whole village watches,

11:32.659 --> 11:35.727
their most powerful warrior
demands that I disrobe.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.196
Whoa, okay, fascinating.
Will return to.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.532
But I meant
your wildest<i> food</i> fantasy.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.234
I, uh...
I don't know if I should say.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.236
Oh,
this is gonna be good!

11:46.473 --> 11:49.074
I've always wanted to eat
a gorilla --

11:49.076 --> 11:51.743
a gorilla that can speak
sign language.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.244
I wanna eat its brain.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.847
Oh,
that is truly horrifying.

11:55.849 --> 11:59.417
Oh, I'm disgusted!
You should be disgusted.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.787
But I do know a guy.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.991
I can't believe this.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.060
The C.I.A. would be stupid
to store their data this way.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.395
They<i> are</i> stupids!

12:10.397 --> 12:11.996
Oh, with what's on here,

12:11.998 --> 12:14.599
we could take them down!
There won't even be a C.I.A.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.501
Wait,
that seems a tad strong.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.869
You don't get a vote.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.604
I thought
I was N.S.A. material.

12:19.606 --> 12:23.341
Not anymore. You're what we call
a "discarded asset."

12:23.343 --> 12:24.676
(door whooshes)
Later, traitor.

12:24.678 --> 12:27.045
(gasps)

12:27.047 --> 12:28.580
(door whooshes)

12:31.952 --> 12:34.686
(door whooshes)
Sorry, gotta swipe you
out of this door, too.

12:34.688 --> 12:37.055
(door whooshes)
That'll get you
as far as the cafeteria.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.623
Someone there will have to
swipe you to the garage.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.558
Then you can just walk up
the ramp.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.527
Technically, you have
to swipe at the top,

12:42.529 --> 12:43.795
but it's just one of
those arm gates,

12:43.797 --> 12:47.532
so you can just duck
under it. Uh, bye!

12:47.534 --> 12:49.100
(door whooshes)

12:52.205 --> 12:53.738
(crickets chirping)

12:53.740 --> 12:57.208
Oh...
(mumbles indistinctly)

12:57.210 --> 12:58.576
(playing harmonica)

12:58.578 --> 13:02.247
The C.I.A.
what happened to the C.I.A.?

13:02.249 --> 13:04.482
Hush, papa.
The C.I.A. is gone.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.751
It's been gone
for a long time.

13:06.753 --> 13:11.089
Who betrayed me?
Someone betrayed me.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.924
Well, I did it.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.960
I provided food
for the family.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.262
It's Klaus.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.730
But...but...

13:18.732 --> 13:22.133
(voice breaking)
We can't afford tartar sauce!

13:22.135 --> 13:25.937
(all sobbing)

13:25.939 --> 13:28.573
Well, I guess I'd better go
to my job as a stripper.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.910
(horns honking)

13:31.912 --> 13:34.913
(siren wailing)

13:34.915 --> 13:36.481
What's happened?
(Latin music playing)

13:36.483 --> 13:38.483
(Spanish accent)
With your C.I.A. gone,

13:38.485 --> 13:40.518
it was easy for Cuba
to invade United States.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.254
All hail Fidel!
(shouting indistinctly)

13:43.256 --> 13:45.490
(gasps)
What a horrible nightmare.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.792
And why did I include that
extra part

13:47.794 --> 13:49.994
where I actually saw
Mom stripping?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.963
One problem at a time.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.364
(snoring)

13:53.366 --> 13:56.434
Dad. Dad, wake up.
I did something terrible.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.669
I was snooping on you,

13:57.671 --> 13:59.470
and I heard
what you said about me.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.806
And I got so mad
I betrayed you to the N.S.A.

14:01.808 --> 14:03.141
The N.S.A.?

14:03.143 --> 14:04.475
I gave them
all your floppy disks,

14:04.477 --> 14:05.810
and they're gonna use them

14:05.812 --> 14:07.345
to put the C.I.A.
out of business!

14:07.347 --> 14:09.814
I feel so awful.
How can I make this up to you?

14:09.816 --> 14:11.716
I'm afraid that's impossible,
son.

14:11.718 --> 14:14.319
Wha...no! Papa, please!

14:14.321 --> 14:17.722
Remember when you and I built
that fort out in the woods?

14:17.724 --> 14:20.625
I'd suggest you go live
in that fort, Steve.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.061
No traitors can live
under my roof.

14:23.063 --> 14:26.064
Can --
Can I say goodbye to mom?

14:27.300 --> 14:30.869
That's her waving goodbye,
Steve.

14:32.839 --> 14:36.641
I'm on my own...
maybe forever.

14:36.643 --> 14:40.245
(crying)

14:40.247 --> 14:44.048
I should probably wait
to eat my snacks.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.050
I'll just put 'em
where I can see 'em.

14:46.052 --> 14:50.588
(thunder crashes)

14:50.590 --> 14:53.591
(bird chirps)

14:53.593 --> 14:55.393
(squawks)

14:55.395 --> 14:57.028
(inhales deeply)

14:57.030 --> 14:59.731
(Southern accent) So y'all wanna
eat a signing gorilla?

14:59.733 --> 15:01.366
We got one. Mittens!

15:01.368 --> 15:03.434
(door squeaks)

15:06.673 --> 15:08.840
You got the money?

15:08.842 --> 15:12.377
All right. You folks think
about wine pairings.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.145
(stomp)

15:16.549 --> 15:18.016
Are we okay with this?

15:18.018 --> 15:20.385
After today,
I am never eating meat again.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.853
But I'm going out on top.

15:21.855 --> 15:23.922
No, I mean,
are we okay with wine?

15:23.924 --> 15:26.424
I've always heard beer
with gorilla brain.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.494
(thunder crashing)

15:32.532 --> 15:34.198
(Steve shivering)

15:34.200 --> 15:35.800
Why did I betray my dad?

15:35.802 --> 15:38.102
And why did I eat
all my snacks?

15:38.104 --> 15:40.705
You'll always have snacks
as long as I'm around.

15:40.707 --> 15:41.973
Dad!

15:41.975 --> 15:44.275
Steve,
I was hurt you betrayed me.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.611
But now I can see
where it came from.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.112
I was just so mad.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.648
You told your friends
I wasn't C.I.A. material!

15:50.650 --> 15:52.784
And then I turned out
<i> not</i> to be!

15:52.786 --> 15:55.386
Whoa, buck up, son.
I'm sorry I said that.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.888
And I was wrong, anyway.

15:56.890 --> 15:58.957
I mean,
you figured out my plan.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.591
You're right. I...
Your plan?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.894
You knew I'd never
kick you out of the house.

16:02.896 --> 16:05.229
I just needed to get you
somewhere where I knew

16:05.231 --> 16:06.965
the N.S.A.
couldn't snoop on us.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.599
<i> Right.</i> Your<i> plan.</i>

16:08.601 --> 16:12.103
That's why I could afford to eat
all my snacks right away.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.639
I didn't have to play
the long game.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.477
Now, where do you think
my disks are?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.479
Forget the disks.
They've uploaded the data.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.481
They won't be clouded yet,
not secure enough.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.517
But it will be somewhere
backed up on their server farm.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.252
Okay, I don't know
what any of that means.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.088
The crucial thing is
we get those disks back.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.956
How are we gonna get
in there?

16:31.958 --> 16:34.959
They have triple lock,
fingerprint encryption systems.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.327
Did you check the roof?

16:36.329 --> 16:37.595
Nerds never go up
on the roof.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.297
'Cause of the sun.

16:39.299 --> 16:43.634
(pop, rope whirs)

16:43.636 --> 16:45.370
Come on, Steve!
Follow me up!

16:45.372 --> 16:48.706
A rope climb?
Dad, I can't do it!

16:48.708 --> 16:50.141
Sure, you can, Steve!

16:50.143 --> 16:52.777
I don't always say it,
but I believe in you!

16:52.779 --> 16:54.712
(groans)

16:54.714 --> 16:58.383
(grunting)

16:58.385 --> 16:59.717
(groans)

16:59.719 --> 17:03.121
I'm doing it!
All by myself.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.290
(grunts) Uh-oh.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.526
Here's where the rubbing
starts to feel funny.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.561
This'll be a bad time
for a boner.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.730
Don't think about
the rope at school.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.133
Aah! (panting)

17:15.135 --> 17:17.735
I did it! Go home?

17:17.737 --> 17:19.570
Job's not done, son.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.773
(metal clangs, thuds)

17:23.209 --> 17:27.545
Well, isn't this cute?
Father and son.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.380
Yeah, that's right.

17:29.382 --> 17:33.251
This is my dad,
Stan Smith of the C.I.A.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.087
C.I.A.?!
No, The-Theodore!

17:36.089 --> 17:38.189
(sighs) Shoot them.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.091
You ever even fire
that thing, son?

17:40.093 --> 17:43.094
(nerdy voice) No. I downloaded
a PDF about gun use.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.562
Shoot him!

17:44.564 --> 17:47.331
(gunshot, glass shatters)
Aah! So loud!

17:47.333 --> 17:50.501
You're just a bunch of nerds.
What do bullies do to nerds?

17:50.503 --> 17:52.003
Steve?

17:52.005 --> 17:53.337
A purple nurple!

17:53.339 --> 17:55.940
Ah, ah, ah!
Titty twister!

17:55.942 --> 17:59.710
Ow!
Okay, now how 'bout one
that's not on the nipple?

17:59.712 --> 18:02.613
Noogie!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

18:02.615 --> 18:05.716
Quit punching yourself!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

18:05.718 --> 18:07.185
Pig belly!
(slapping sound)

18:07.187 --> 18:11.089
Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah!
Wedgie! No. Atomic wedgie!

18:11.091 --> 18:12.557
(high-pitched voice)
Aah, aah, aah!

18:12.559 --> 18:15.793
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ah, ah, ah!

18:15.795 --> 18:18.062
Aah! Ow, ow, ow.

18:18.064 --> 18:22.266
You're what we call...
a discarded asshole.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.868
(door whooshes)

18:23.870 --> 18:25.236
Lousy machines.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.939
Storing
America's private data.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.273
(clanking)

18:29.275 --> 18:31.442
Dad, dad!
I know a better way.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.178
They're all connected
in a series.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.648
Like Christmas lights, papa.

18:37.650 --> 18:42.787
(electricity crackling)

18:42.789 --> 18:44.589
(machines powering down)
No!

18:44.591 --> 18:50.228
Error 404 --
N.S.A. files not found.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.096
Nat, are you gonna take
that underwear off your head?

18:52.098 --> 18:56.134
It's the only thing
that feels good right now.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.636
(crickets chirping)

18:58.638 --> 18:59.937
(fork clinks)

18:59.939 --> 19:02.406
Mmm, I think I just ate
the memory

19:02.408 --> 19:05.143
of when it was taken away
from its mom.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.078
So, no sides at all?

19:08.414 --> 19:10.748
(fork clinks)

19:10.750 --> 19:13.985
Mmm, oh...

19:13.987 --> 19:16.687
Oh, no.
Oh, this was a mistake.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.589
You're damn right it was!

19:18.591 --> 19:21.759
Gus Derwitt, U.S. Fish
& Wildlife Service.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.328
We got you on tape
eating an endangered species.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.030
That's
a 10-year prison term.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.533
Please, she accidentally ate
veal this morning.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.201
You can see how
we got here.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.436
We're so sorry!
Please don't turn us in!

19:32.438 --> 19:35.206
Hmm, well, my hands
aren't exactly clean either.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.774
There was probably a way
to do this

19:36.776 --> 19:39.277
without butchering
a gorilla.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.712
Tell you what,
give me $10,000,

19:41.714 --> 19:43.447
I'll let you walk.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.050
I have $60.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.986
I have two stamps
and a used ticket

19:48.988 --> 19:50.555
to Chicago's
Adler Planetarium.

19:50.557 --> 19:54.192
Hand it over and get out of here
before I change my mind.

19:56.396 --> 19:59.964
(gulps)
There should be sides.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.500
We got 60 bucks

20:02.502 --> 20:06.704
and whatever two Forever stamps
is worth these days.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.673
(growls)

20:08.675 --> 20:10.641
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.344
(grunts)

20:13.346 --> 20:14.645
(growls)

20:14.647 --> 20:16.547
The old gorilla brain
switcheroo

20:16.549 --> 20:18.549
doesn't play like
it used to.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.384
Maybe we need
a new swindle.

20:22.188 --> 20:25.056
You wanna grift with
someone else? That's fine.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.592
But you still gon' be
my husband.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.160
(grunts)

20:33.433 --> 20:36.400
Tonight, you proved
you are C.I.A. material.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.569
We just did
a mission together.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.937
Put her there.

20:39.939 --> 20:43.274
Hmm, nothing we can do
about the sweat.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.942
That's from
your mom's side.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.777
But you can tighten up
the grip.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.112
All right, all right.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.014
Still pretty weak,
but getting there.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.349
(groans)

20:51.351 --> 20:54.585
There it is!
Now that's a handshake.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.587
Cute kid.
You leaving him as a tip?

20:56.589 --> 20:57.955
(laughter)

20:57.957 --> 20:59.924
'Cause last time,
you didn't leave a tip.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.126
Trish.
Trish.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.128
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
