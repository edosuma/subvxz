00:29.289 --> 00:32.360
- Third drowning this year.
- Anyone see it happen?

00:32.529 --> 00:34.565
- Is that her little girl?
- Get her away from here.

00:34.729 --> 00:37.163
- Don't let her see her mom like this.
- Mommy!

00:37.449 --> 00:40.805
Are you Prue?
Your gram sent me to find you.

00:40.969 --> 00:43.278
Why don't you come
back inside with me, okay?

00:49.249 --> 00:50.921
Mommy!

00:55.329 --> 00:57.160
Mommy!

01:10.009 --> 01:12.318
- Hello?
- Prue? Are you still on the road?

01:13.609 --> 01:15.042
Yeah, traffic's insane.

01:16.569 --> 01:17.763
Some guy called from Buckland's

01:17.929 --> 01:20.045
and thought you'd be back
from the estate sale already.

01:20.209 --> 01:22.439
I was just calling to make sure
you and my car were okay.

01:23.049 --> 01:26.121
- Yeah. We're fine.
- Oh, that's... That's probably Dan.

01:26.289 --> 01:28.041
You know, he does live,
like, 20 feet away.

01:28.209 --> 01:30.848
I mean, you guys could get
walkie-talkies, two cans, a string.

01:31.009 --> 01:32.283
Point taken, Mom.

01:33.569 --> 01:36.925
All right, look, go talk to your boy.
I'll see you later.

02:29.969 --> 02:31.721
Help me!

02:32.249 --> 02:33.238
Help!

02:35.129 --> 02:36.357
Help me!

02:37.809 --> 02:39.561
No! It's too late.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.201
It's already taken him.

02:44.369 --> 02:45.563
Just call 911!

04:16.529 --> 04:17.757
Yeah.

04:28.049 --> 04:31.007
- Pouring.
- Chewing.

04:31.889 --> 04:33.242
Can't believe you eat that stuff.

04:33.409 --> 04:35.684
You guys are killing me
with cuteness over here.

04:35.849 --> 04:39.398
Don't you have somewhere to be?
Somewhere very far away?

04:40.689 --> 04:42.600
What do you say tomorrow,
when Jenny's at school,

04:42.769 --> 04:45.681
- we have breakfast for real?
- I'll take what I can get.

04:45.849 --> 04:47.328
Nausea?

04:48.409 --> 04:50.639
What are you doing home? You said
you were heading to the office.

04:51.049 --> 04:52.402
Yeah, things changed.

04:53.009 --> 04:55.648
- Dan, I have to call you back, okay?
- Okay.

04:56.249 --> 04:58.922
Okay, I saw something...

04:59.089 --> 05:00.647
...or someone...

05:00.809 --> 05:03.323
...drown. And it was
anything but natural.

05:03.489 --> 05:05.207
On the freeway?

05:05.369 --> 05:08.645
- No, up at the lake.
- Oh, wait a minute.

05:09.289 --> 05:12.440
The lake as in the lake?
Where Mom was killed?

05:13.769 --> 05:15.327
You said you were stuck in traffic.

05:15.929 --> 05:19.319
Yeah, I was, after the lake.
I just go there sometimes to think.

05:19.489 --> 05:21.241
You never told us that.

05:21.409 --> 05:23.365
Because I didn't wanna make
a big deal out of it.

05:23.529 --> 05:25.042
Anyway, this isn't about Mom,
all right?

05:25.209 --> 05:28.440
I saw someone get pulled under.
I tried to help him,

05:28.609 --> 05:32.045
but this man stopped me and said,
"It's already taken him."

05:32.209 --> 05:33.642
Do you think he knows
what happened?

05:33.809 --> 05:36.403
Could. Which means
I need to get to Buckland's

05:36.569 --> 05:39.288
to drop stuff off
and get back up to that lake.

05:39.969 --> 05:42.608
Wait a minute, Prue,
aren't you kind of missing the point?

05:42.769 --> 05:43.997
How can you think
whatever you saw

05:44.169 --> 05:46.125
didn't have something to do
with how Mom died?

05:46.289 --> 05:48.280
Look, we need to stop
worrying about the past

05:48.449 --> 05:50.883
and start dealing with the present.
They're reopening camp.

05:51.049 --> 05:52.801
I thought they closed it
the summer that Mom...

05:52.969 --> 05:56.803
Exactly. And no one has been
allowed in the lake since.

05:56.969 --> 05:58.482
And if there's something in it killing,

05:58.649 --> 06:00.879
then the last thing we need
is a lake full of kids.

06:01.049 --> 06:02.846
Well, how do we find the guy
that stopped you?

06:03.009 --> 06:05.284
What about the woman who used
to run the camp? Mrs Johnson?

06:05.449 --> 06:07.519
If she's still up there,
she probably knows who he is.

06:07.729 --> 06:09.082
She's still there, same cabin.

06:09.649 --> 06:11.719
So I guess you go
up there to think a lot.

06:12.449 --> 06:16.124
I'll meet you guys up at the lake.
I should be there in an hour.

06:16.529 --> 06:19.601
Do you really think the thing she saw
has nothing to do with how Mom died?

06:19.769 --> 06:22.363
- Nope. You?
- Not a chance.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.727
- What are you doing here?
- Pondering the possibilities.

06:30.889 --> 06:33.198
- Of?
- Redecoration.

06:33.369 --> 06:36.918
Where's your flair in this place,
the panache?

06:37.089 --> 06:39.319
- The Prue?
- Well,

06:39.489 --> 06:41.639
I don't really think that's
any of your business, Jack.

06:41.809 --> 06:44.369
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a lot of work to do,

06:44.529 --> 06:47.362
so perhaps you could go annoy
somebody down the hall.

06:47.529 --> 06:49.042
Actually, already did.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.279
Signed the dotted line,
they sent me to my office.

06:51.449 --> 06:54.088
- Your office?
- Well, it's only temporary, of course,

06:54.249 --> 06:56.479
until mine is ready.

06:56.649 --> 06:58.526
Wait, you think
that you're working here?

06:58.689 --> 07:01.761
Well, you said we couldn't date
and work together,

07:01.929 --> 07:05.888
so since you won't date me,
one out of the two will have to do.

07:07.889 --> 07:09.720
And you consider that
proper work attire.

07:09.889 --> 07:11.686
Hey, if you can get away
with wearing that,

07:11.849 --> 07:13.487
I can certainly get away
with wearing this.

07:13.889 --> 07:17.279
No wonder nobody gets any work
done around here. You look:

07:18.409 --> 07:20.320
Flattery will get you nowhere.

07:20.489 --> 07:22.161
Well, got me this job.

07:22.329 --> 07:25.480
Okay, look, I have to go take care
of some personal things.

07:25.649 --> 07:29.767
So until I get back, let's just employ
a hands-off policy, meaning,

07:29.929 --> 07:31.999
don't touch anything.

07:33.049 --> 07:37.918
Tell you what. Take your time. I'll sit
back here and make myself comfy.

07:43.049 --> 07:46.405
It's really nice form, but the dismount
could use a little work.

07:47.169 --> 07:48.966
Meant to do that.

07:54.609 --> 07:57.043
Well, I'm finding it hard to believe
enough time's gone by

07:57.209 --> 07:59.518
for you to have grown up
so much. Here.

08:00.169 --> 08:01.921
Oh, look at little Prue.

08:02.089 --> 08:04.364
- Nice pigtails, Piper.
- Not fair.

08:04.529 --> 08:09.080
No, what's not fair is that I never
got to go to camp with you guys.

08:10.369 --> 08:12.803
We heard you were thinking
of opening up the camp again.

08:13.569 --> 08:17.642
Was. I thought it was over,
and then today, another drowning.

08:17.809 --> 08:21.199
I can't ask the campers
to go swimming in the lake when...

08:22.649 --> 08:24.765
We were wondering if you might
help us with something.

08:24.929 --> 08:28.239
Prue was up here the other day,
and she mentioned a man.

08:28.409 --> 08:30.161
Older, a bit off.

08:30.329 --> 08:32.889
I think the word
that she used was "crazy."

08:33.049 --> 08:34.801
We were wondering
if you might know who he is.

08:34.969 --> 08:38.678
Oh, Sam. Only one it could be.
Man's not wired together properly.

08:38.849 --> 08:40.601
He showed up
when the drownings started.

08:40.769 --> 08:44.364
And then just stayed here.
No friends, no life of his own.

08:44.529 --> 08:48.442
You know, somebody like that, you
have to wonder what he's capable of.

09:05.369 --> 09:07.485
Mrs J., you remember my sister Prue?

09:07.649 --> 09:12.359
Oh, Prue. Of course I do.
How good to see you.

09:12.529 --> 09:16.078
Wow, you're looking more and more
like your mother every day.

09:16.769 --> 09:19.363
Actually, it's Piper
who resembles her the most.

09:22.689 --> 09:26.602
People see a little of her
in each of us, I think.

09:27.249 --> 09:30.764
Of course. Well, will you come
see me again?

09:30.929 --> 09:32.647
The old broad gets lonely up here.

09:32.809 --> 09:35.926
- I love to see my campers.
- Sure.

09:36.089 --> 09:37.204
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.597
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:46.689 --> 09:48.361
She's not opening the camp, Prue.

09:48.529 --> 09:50.281
Really? So that means
it's just between us

09:50.449 --> 09:52.599
and whatever's hiding in that lake.

09:52.769 --> 09:56.079
- Any word on the crazy guy?
- His name is Sam, and he lives right...

09:59.329 --> 10:02.446
- Hello. This is Prue.
- Hey. How's my favourite auctionette?

10:02.609 --> 10:07.285
- Fine. How's my favourite auction ass?
- Oh, nice one.

10:07.449 --> 10:10.168
Hey, listen, I just wanted to let you
know that since you're not here,

10:10.329 --> 10:12.365
I'm gonna take your 12:00 lunch
with Mr Fujimoto.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.008
No. No, no, no, wait.

10:14.169 --> 10:17.320
- Mr Fujimoto is very particular.
- Prue, would you relax?

10:17.489 --> 10:21.402
I will take great care of your client,
okay? Later.

10:25.289 --> 10:27.849
I just cannot figure out
what this guy's deal is.

10:28.009 --> 10:30.204
That's funny, we were just gonna
ask you the same thing.

10:30.369 --> 10:31.597
Excuse me?

10:32.449 --> 10:34.644
Every time someone compares you
to Mom, you flinch.

10:34.809 --> 10:37.482
- It's a compliment, not a curse.
- Is it?

10:37.649 --> 10:40.209
Every single day, I feel like I'm
becoming more and more like her,

10:40.369 --> 10:42.121
and every day, it terrifies me.

10:42.289 --> 10:44.359
- Prue...
- I mean, don't you guys see it?

10:45.089 --> 10:48.047
Look at what happened to her and
then look at what's happening to me.

10:48.209 --> 10:51.519
No successful relationship with guys,
being responsible for a family

10:51.689 --> 10:54.362
and now, because of this
being-charmed thing,

10:54.569 --> 10:58.118
the very real possibility of dying young.
It's like history is repeating itself.

10:58.289 --> 11:01.087
- Prue, that's all just...
- Coincidence?

11:01.449 --> 11:04.919
I thought that we had figured out that
nothing is a coincidence in our lives.

11:05.089 --> 11:06.807
Like me being here
when that thing attacked.

11:06.969 --> 11:08.482
It's like I was meant to be here.

11:08.649 --> 11:10.640
Well, you're not exactly
meant to be here

11:10.809 --> 11:12.959
when you're here every week.

11:13.129 --> 11:17.998
All right, look, I just wanna
find this Sam guy,

11:18.169 --> 11:22.526
see what he knows about the demon,
vanquish it and get on with our lives.

12:22.129 --> 12:23.801
Sam?

12:26.169 --> 12:28.683
Be very, very quiet.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.680
We're hunting demons.

12:31.649 --> 12:33.287
I guess he's not home.

12:42.569 --> 12:45.606
- Oh, my.
- What?

12:46.049 --> 12:48.358
- What is it?
- Mom.

12:48.529 --> 12:51.089
What is he doing
with a picture of her?

12:51.249 --> 12:53.843
- Who is this guy?
- Or what?

12:55.569 --> 12:59.608
Okay, he has articles
on every single drowning at the lake.

13:02.489 --> 13:05.879
"New York teacher of the year,
Sam Wilder."

13:06.049 --> 13:07.368
In 1872?

13:07.529 --> 13:11.727
Okay, so this guy is
either 127 years old or...

13:12.329 --> 13:13.842
A demon.

13:14.009 --> 13:17.081
Named Sam? A demon
named Sam? I mean,

13:17.249 --> 13:19.399
can't it just be
his grandfather's certificate?

13:19.569 --> 13:21.878
After all, he did save me.

13:22.209 --> 13:25.406
What are these? I found...

13:26.369 --> 13:28.246
Leo? Hi. What are doing here?

13:28.409 --> 13:30.445
We gotta get out of here.
Sam could be back any minute.

13:30.609 --> 13:32.327
- Wait, you know Sam?
- Come on. We gotta...

13:32.489 --> 13:36.164
We are not going anywhere until you
tell us what you know. Who is Sam?

13:36.649 --> 13:39.083
Sam was...

13:40.049 --> 13:41.562
...your mom's whitelighter.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.479
Sam was Mom's whitelighter?

13:55.649 --> 13:57.719
Emphasis on "was."

13:58.089 --> 14:00.922
When your mom died,
Sam clipped his wings.

14:01.089 --> 14:03.728
He's mortal now, but once,
yeah, he was...

14:03.889 --> 14:06.687
He was a whitelighter.
He looked after your mother.

14:06.849 --> 14:08.202
Then he lost our mom.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.087
To the same demon
you're fighting now.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.809
And you knew? This whole time,
he's been living up here while...?

14:12.969 --> 14:16.006
I couldn't tell you.
And what would it change?

14:16.169 --> 14:20.082
You know, it would only distract you.
Maybe even gotten you killed.

14:20.529 --> 14:24.283
You guys were gonna have to face
this thing sooner or later.

14:25.129 --> 14:28.007
I'm here to make sure that you do it
with a clear head.

14:28.169 --> 14:30.364
Emotions will get the best of you
if you let them.

14:30.529 --> 14:34.363
- Well, can you really blame us?
- Leo, he let our mother die.

14:35.009 --> 14:36.727
Leo's right, this isn't about Mom.

14:37.329 --> 14:39.320
And it's not about Sam,
for that matter.

14:39.489 --> 14:42.367
It's about a demon who's waiting
till tomorrow for brunch to be served.

14:42.529 --> 14:44.201
Mrs J. Is not opening the camp.

14:44.369 --> 14:46.041
That doesn't end it, it just stalls it.

14:46.209 --> 14:48.040
You guys are behind
and need to catch up.

14:48.209 --> 14:50.279
Book of Shadows, get
a working knowledge of this demon

14:50.449 --> 14:51.723
before you face him.

14:51.889 --> 14:54.801
Said like an unfeeling professional.

14:54.969 --> 14:56.448
This is personal for us, Leo.

14:56.609 --> 14:59.919
Leo doesn't do personal anymore,
he just does his job.

15:02.809 --> 15:04.481
Now that I've done it,

15:04.649 --> 15:07.880
guess there's no other reason
for me to hang around.

15:12.529 --> 15:14.759
Okay, he's gone.
Now you can explain.

15:14.929 --> 15:16.920
- Explain what?
- Why you're acting like all of this

15:17.089 --> 15:19.000
doesn't faze you, Prue.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.729
We are talking about
how our mother was killed.

15:22.169 --> 15:24.637
Help! Oh, please, somebody!
Help me!

15:24.809 --> 15:26.481
Is that Mrs Johnson?

15:27.249 --> 15:29.444
Please help me!

15:30.409 --> 15:32.081
Please help!

15:37.969 --> 15:39.561
Help me, please. Help!

15:39.729 --> 15:41.845
Your hand! Give me your hand!

15:42.929 --> 15:45.238
Prue, what are you doing?
We need you!

15:47.769 --> 15:49.202
Mommy!

15:49.369 --> 15:52.247
Get off the dock! It's her!

15:54.169 --> 15:56.319
It's taken her over!

15:56.489 --> 15:58.605
- Oh, my...
- God!

15:59.689 --> 16:01.884
Damn it, get off the dock now!

16:10.729 --> 16:11.878
Why didn't you listen to me?

16:12.049 --> 16:15.246
I told you to stay away from the lake.
It only kills in the water.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.845
Why didn't you listen to me?
Nobody ever listens!

16:18.009 --> 16:20.284
We know who you are.

16:20.449 --> 16:22.007
You shouldn't listen
to people in town.

16:22.169 --> 16:24.444
They'll just tell you I'm crazy.
But I'm not.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.242
We know you worked
with our mother.

16:26.409 --> 16:28.320
And lost her.

16:29.609 --> 16:32.407
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

16:32.609 --> 16:34.679
And then when I saw you...

16:34.849 --> 16:37.647
It's in your eyes. Your mother.

16:37.809 --> 16:40.084
You have no right talking about her.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.047
You lost that right when you lost her.

16:43.889 --> 16:45.083
Why are we dealing with him?

16:45.249 --> 16:46.682
Because we need to know
what he knows.

16:46.849 --> 16:48.202
You have to tell us
about the demon.

16:48.369 --> 16:49.768
No. No, you can't fight this thing.

16:49.929 --> 16:52.443
It's made of water, but it has a...
It thinks.

16:52.609 --> 16:55.077
You never know where it's gonna be,
who it's gonna be.

16:55.249 --> 16:59.162
Sometimes it takes over its victims'
bodies to lure you to the water.

16:59.329 --> 17:02.002
But sometimes it doesn't.
Leave now, please.

17:02.169 --> 17:04.444
Forget you ever came here.
Forget you ever knew.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.917
How can we do that?
I mean, it's out there killing.

17:07.089 --> 17:08.602
We can't just walk away.

17:08.769 --> 17:10.839
You really wanna know
what I know?

17:12.089 --> 17:13.363
I know you're not strong enough

17:13.529 --> 17:16.646
or well-versed enough in your powers
to take this thing on.

17:16.809 --> 17:19.960
I know that you have the same power
as your mother, the power to freeze.

17:20.128 --> 17:23.280
And you know what happened
when she tried to used it.

17:24.809 --> 17:27.198
And I know you'll let your emotions
get in the way.

17:27.368 --> 17:30.486
You'll lose focus, and you'll lose
your life. That's what I know.

17:31.129 --> 17:34.565
Well, you obviously don't know us
that well, because we're not leaving.

17:35.889 --> 17:39.279
Strong, wilful. Just like Patty.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.644
I'm nothing like my mother.

17:41.969 --> 17:43.880
But you're here.

17:44.529 --> 17:46.565
- Just like she was.
- But we'll beat it.

17:47.929 --> 17:50.045
Now you have one choice.

17:50.369 --> 17:53.202
You can either get onboard
or get the hell out of the way.

17:53.609 --> 17:55.884
The power of three. Okay, okay.

17:57.929 --> 18:01.126
If you're gonna do this, then you're
gonna need me to help you.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.166
All right, enough of this.
How do we kill it?

18:04.449 --> 18:05.564
You don't.

18:09.689 --> 18:13.238
Now, you're gonna go home,
and you're gonna go directly to bed.

18:13.409 --> 18:16.526
And when you wake up tomorrow, you
will not remember coming to the lake

18:16.689 --> 18:18.919
or discovering the demon
or meeting me.

18:23.889 --> 18:26.039
Can't let it happen again.

18:38.609 --> 18:43.285
I fell asleep, woke up,
and suddenly it's Thursday.

18:43.969 --> 18:46.085
I don't feel so good.

18:47.369 --> 18:50.167
- What is that?
- I don't know. I itch everywhere.

18:50.369 --> 18:52.325
That looks like the time
Prue got poison ivy.

18:52.489 --> 18:54.684
But Prue got poison ivy
at camp, and...

19:07.049 --> 19:09.040
You don't look hungry.

19:09.529 --> 19:11.167
You look confused.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.201
And you're contagious.

19:13.649 --> 19:15.321
- Dan, what are you doing...?
- Breakfast.

19:15.929 --> 19:18.648
Me, you, here.

19:19.609 --> 19:20.962
Remember?

19:21.129 --> 19:22.847
Everything's a little hazy
this morning.

19:23.009 --> 19:25.569
Well, is there anything I can do?

19:28.329 --> 19:30.889
You could hold that thought.

19:32.649 --> 19:35.209
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here? I live here.

19:35.369 --> 19:37.883
What are you, checking up on me
and Dan? We talked about this.

19:38.049 --> 19:40.483
It has nothing to do with him.
Why aren't you up at the lake?

19:40.649 --> 19:41.968
What lake?

19:43.489 --> 19:47.448
Look, nobody shut down the camp,
so the kids are on their way there now.

19:49.329 --> 19:51.797
- He did it, didn't he?
- Did what?

19:51.969 --> 19:53.004
Who did what? Who is he?

19:53.289 --> 19:57.407
Sam used a powder,
sort of like a supernatural mickey.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.208
- Must have got it from...
- Mom.

19:59.729 --> 20:02.289
Good. It's fading. Now, concentrate.
It's kind of like

20:02.449 --> 20:03.723
remembering a dream.

20:04.089 --> 20:07.923
Okay, the lake, the kids,
the demon, Sam.

20:08.609 --> 20:11.487
Sam? Why would he do this to us?

20:11.649 --> 20:14.368
To keep history from repeating itself.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.847
Oh, just a sec. You guys, scoot.
Go, go, go, go, go.

20:26.169 --> 20:28.239
Dan, I know we were
supposed to do this this morning,

20:28.409 --> 20:32.004
- but I'm really not feeling up to it.
- Well, I'll cook while you scratch.

20:32.689 --> 20:36.398
I can't. There's just some stuff,
family stuff, going on.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.447
Say no more.
I completely understand.

20:39.889 --> 20:42.323
- I'd kiss you, but...
- But you're contagious. Tomorrow.

20:45.329 --> 20:46.887
I'm just glad you can tell me things.

20:47.409 --> 20:49.286
Well, I feel like
I can tell you anything.

20:56.129 --> 20:59.007
- Except that there's a demon.
- And that you're a witch.

21:00.449 --> 21:03.009
- Sorry, that was...
- The truth.

21:04.089 --> 21:05.488
We should go get dressed.

21:05.649 --> 21:08.766
The only place that you are going,
contagious girl,

21:08.929 --> 21:10.567
- Why are you hitting me?
- Is back to bed.

21:10.729 --> 21:12.526
- But...
- But nothing.

21:12.689 --> 21:16.443
You just look in that Book of Shadows
for this thing's Achilles heel.

21:16.609 --> 21:20.045
- But what if there isn't one?
- Then we're screwed.

21:46.809 --> 21:49.926
Okay. How are we doing
in the plan department?

21:50.089 --> 21:52.239
- I think I just got one.
- I love when you take charge.

21:52.409 --> 21:54.286
Okay, you know that powder
that Sam used on us?

21:54.449 --> 21:55.802
Maybe we should use it on the kids,

21:55.969 --> 21:58.437
make them temporarily forget
that they wanna go in the water.

21:58.609 --> 22:01.646
That will keep them safe until we figure
out a way to dehydrate this bastard.

22:01.809 --> 22:03.083
- Perfect.
- Right.

22:04.729 --> 22:06.845
- Prepubescent demon food.
- Okay, go.

22:07.009 --> 22:10.206
Keep them out of the water.
Tell them anything. I'll deal with Sam.

22:19.449 --> 22:22.247
I knew I should have given you
a stronger dose.

22:23.569 --> 22:25.480
Not only did you put my sisters
and me in danger,

22:25.649 --> 22:27.685
but you risked innocents' lives.
How could you?

22:27.849 --> 22:30.409
I did what I had to
to protect you and your sisters.

22:30.569 --> 22:32.207
Not that.

22:32.929 --> 22:34.487
This.

22:34.649 --> 22:36.162
All these years.

22:38.249 --> 22:40.843
How could you just sit here
and watch them die?

22:41.009 --> 22:42.727
People that you were meant
to protect.

22:42.889 --> 22:46.848
Well, in case you didn't get the memo,
I'm not one of the good guys anymore.

22:47.009 --> 22:48.840
Part of you is.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.082
Part of you always will be.

22:51.289 --> 22:54.406
I've done nothing but make your life
difficult. What makes you so sure?

22:55.329 --> 22:56.967
Because you saved me.

22:59.689 --> 23:02.681
You still have
whitelighter instincts, Sam.

23:02.889 --> 23:06.279
You may have clipped your wings,
but this still gets you. It matters.

23:09.569 --> 23:12.925
What matters most
was taken from me 20 years ago.

23:15.489 --> 23:18.049
Then we have something in common.

23:19.129 --> 23:22.280
You think I chose to stay here,
to watch?

23:22.449 --> 23:24.679
That I get my kicks this way?

23:26.129 --> 23:29.166
- I've been waiting for you.
- Why?

23:29.329 --> 23:31.399
I knew you'd come.

23:31.569 --> 23:34.242
And I had to be here to stop you.

23:35.169 --> 23:37.000
To save you.

23:38.129 --> 23:40.245
Because you couldn't save Mom?

23:45.649 --> 23:47.765
Sam, I need the powder.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.561
And then I'm gonna need
for you to tell me

23:50.729 --> 23:52.321
how Mom was gonna
vanquish this thing.

23:54.169 --> 23:55.727
If you're gonna defeat
your demons, Sam,

23:55.889 --> 23:59.359
then you're gonna have to help us
defeat the one out there.

24:00.369 --> 24:02.405
We need your help.

24:17.009 --> 24:18.727
I'll try and face mine.

24:20.329 --> 24:22.479
Question is, can you face yours?

24:34.129 --> 24:36.199
Can't find anything.

24:36.369 --> 24:37.722
Then you don't
have to stay with me.

24:37.889 --> 24:40.005
Looks of sympathy are not
part of your job description.

24:40.329 --> 24:41.648
I know.

24:41.809 --> 24:43.561
And why didn't
your healing touch work?

24:43.729 --> 24:46.402
I mean, you can save a life,
but you can't cure poison ivy?

24:46.569 --> 24:48.161
It's not really up to me.

24:48.329 --> 24:51.765
I can only heal when they allow me to,
when I'm meant to.

24:51.929 --> 24:53.885
Well, why wouldn't you
be meant to help me?

24:55.329 --> 24:58.002
Why wouldn't I be meant
to help my sisters?

24:58.169 --> 25:00.364
There's always a reason.

25:00.529 --> 25:02.804
Maybe you're meant to be here.

25:07.609 --> 25:09.804
"Dear Sam..."

25:11.489 --> 25:13.844
- Leo.
- What is it?

25:15.569 --> 25:17.799
Letters that my mom wrote to Sam.

25:17.969 --> 25:21.518
I must have forgotten about them
because of the powder.

25:21.689 --> 25:22.838
"Dear Sam, where are you?

25:23.009 --> 25:25.682
It's been two weeks since you
were last here, and I wonder,

25:25.849 --> 25:29.398
are you all right? Do they have you
off guiding someone?

25:29.569 --> 25:34.040
And I wonder when they will send you
back to San Francisco, to me."

25:34.209 --> 25:36.165
Is this a...?

25:36.329 --> 25:38.399
A love letter?

25:41.769 --> 25:44.841
Okay. How about Red Rover?

25:46.729 --> 25:49.448
All right, all right, how about
Thumbs Up, Seven Up?

25:51.129 --> 25:52.687
Okay.

25:53.769 --> 25:54.758
Lanyards.

25:54.929 --> 25:56.521
This sucks.
We wanna go swimming.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.281
Yeah!

26:00.689 --> 26:03.044
Oh, you know, I could have done that.

26:03.209 --> 26:06.519
- Did you get the powder?
- Oh, I got that and more.

26:07.089 --> 26:10.559
- You didn't have to bring him.
- Yes, I did.

26:11.369 --> 26:12.484
Okay, you go deal with that,

26:12.649 --> 26:14.128
- I'll take care of this.
- Okay.

26:17.489 --> 26:19.764
- Piper?
- Piper? I hardly know her.

26:19.929 --> 26:22.204
Jack. Okay, well, I'm sort of
in the middle of something.

26:22.369 --> 26:24.678
Yadda yadda yadda. Look,
I'm gonna conference Mr Fujimoto

26:24.849 --> 26:26.487
about the carousel horse, okay?
Hold on.

26:26.649 --> 26:29.243
- No, no, no, wait...
- Hello?

26:29.649 --> 26:31.560
Mr Fujimoto, hi.

26:31.849 --> 26:33.202
Miss Halliwell, have you seen it?

26:33.369 --> 26:35.121
No, I'm looking at the object

26:35.289 --> 26:37.086
- right now.
- How is it?

26:37.249 --> 26:39.399
Well, yeah, you can tell
by the jewelled choker

26:39.569 --> 26:41.207
that it's an original carousel horse

26:41.369 --> 26:44.725
from the 1939 world fair
in New York City, and...

26:44.889 --> 26:46.607
And, Mr Fujimoto,
there's another thing

26:46.769 --> 26:48.725
you should probably know
about the piece.

26:48.889 --> 26:50.481
This is a great piece,

26:50.649 --> 26:55.279
and I really think you want to have
the first chance at it.

26:56.969 --> 26:59.961
Okay, good. Good. Well, I'll have
the paperwork sent over today.

27:00.129 --> 27:02.689
- Sounds like a good idea.
- All right. Bye, now.

27:05.049 --> 27:07.165
So who are you crediting
as the sales agent, Jack?

27:07.929 --> 27:10.079
Prue, do you not trust me?

27:19.569 --> 27:24.006
Okay. Now, remember, kids,
on your way to bed, water bad.

27:24.169 --> 27:28.560
Land good. Water bad. Land good.

27:30.569 --> 27:33.686
"Sam, yes, you were clear.
My eyes are open to the difficulties,

27:33.849 --> 27:35.805
the risks, but my answer is the same

27:35.969 --> 27:38.039
as it was when you were
still here with me.

27:38.209 --> 27:41.645
No one understands me
the way you do. No one can."

27:41.809 --> 27:45.279
"What I wouldn't do for
what other people consider ordinary.

27:45.449 --> 27:50.284
Conversation that gets finished,
a night spent uninterrupted,

27:50.449 --> 27:52.280
a night with you."

27:54.529 --> 27:56.838
It's like I could have written these.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.681
I wish you had.

27:59.249 --> 28:00.841
What would it have changed?

28:04.649 --> 28:08.198
Looks like this one's
about our water demon.

28:08.369 --> 28:10.007
"You can't be with me up at the lake.

28:10.169 --> 28:13.002
This demon is too strong,
and I can't risk losing you,

28:13.169 --> 28:15.478
not for myself
or the others you protect.

28:15.649 --> 28:17.958
They must, as always, come first.

28:18.329 --> 28:21.162
You know I'd never face this demon
if I didn't think

28:21.329 --> 28:24.844
I'd be home in time for dinner
to see my girls,

28:25.009 --> 28:26.965
to see you."

28:28.569 --> 28:31.083
She never came home.

28:32.009 --> 28:33.806
When did this happen?
Where was Dad?

28:34.289 --> 28:37.087
Your sisters need to know
about Sam and your mom, Piper.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.160
And if this demon is as strong
as she thought,

28:39.329 --> 28:43.447
then they're going to need me. But
how can we get up there in time to...?

28:44.729 --> 28:47.527
Can you? I mean,
is it breaking the rules?

28:47.689 --> 28:50.522
What rules haven't we already broken?

28:51.569 --> 28:53.366
I'll have to hold you.

29:05.729 --> 29:09.517
It's time, Sam. We need to know.
How was Mom gonna vanquish it?

29:11.889 --> 29:13.641
I don't know.

29:13.809 --> 29:16.767
I failed, I lost her. Isn't that enough?

29:17.569 --> 29:19.560
Whoa, that felt really...

29:19.729 --> 29:21.526
All right, laying down now.

29:22.569 --> 29:24.366
What are you guys doing here?

29:24.529 --> 29:26.281
- He loved her.
- What?

29:26.449 --> 29:28.679
Who loved who?
What is she talking about?

29:28.849 --> 29:29.884
Sam.

29:32.089 --> 29:33.602
Found the letters, Sam.

29:35.809 --> 29:37.925
Patty and I...

29:38.089 --> 29:40.364
Fell in love.

29:41.649 --> 29:45.119
In her letter, she told you to stay away,
not to go to the lake.

29:45.729 --> 29:47.765
But I did.

29:48.449 --> 29:51.361
I wouldn't have for anyone else.

29:51.529 --> 29:53.042
If I had just followed the rules,

29:53.209 --> 29:55.120
not fallen in love,
I never would have been there,

29:55.289 --> 29:58.361
I never would have distracted her,
and she never would have died.

29:59.969 --> 30:01.766
You loved her,
and you blame yourself.

30:02.369 --> 30:04.599
Well, don't you blame me?

30:05.249 --> 30:07.558
Every day, I wake up,
and for just a second,

30:07.729 --> 30:10.448
just a second, I think
maybe it didn't happen, maybe...

30:13.449 --> 30:15.758
Yes, I blame myself.

30:16.529 --> 30:19.566
We have to see past our emotions
to deal with this, Sam. So do you.

30:20.249 --> 30:23.207
Even so, it doesn't change
the fact that I...

30:23.369 --> 30:25.724
I didn't see what happened.

30:25.889 --> 30:28.881
- I tried to warn her, and she froze me.
- Why?

30:29.049 --> 30:31.165
Because she was
trying to protect him.

30:32.289 --> 30:34.849
Protecting was
supposed to be my job.

30:36.569 --> 30:38.639
I couldn't help her,
I don't know how I can help you.

30:38.809 --> 30:41.243
I didn't see what happened.

30:41.969 --> 30:43.800
I know somebody
who can see anything.

30:46.809 --> 30:49.767
No. Wait a minute.

30:50.489 --> 30:54.118
You tiptoe around the subject of Mom,
you deny looking like her.

30:54.289 --> 30:56.280
You can't even go
to the end of that dock,

30:56.449 --> 30:59.043
because you're afraid
to walk in her footsteps.

30:59.209 --> 31:04.283
And now you want me
to relive her last moment?

31:04.489 --> 31:07.481
- How is that fair?
- It's not.

31:08.089 --> 31:11.559
None of this is,
Mom's death, Sam's guilt.

31:11.729 --> 31:13.720
But I'm asking you to help me end it.

31:42.729 --> 31:46.085
Hey, look out! Look out!

32:02.169 --> 32:04.125
Did you see her?

32:04.889 --> 32:06.322
Lt...

32:07.009 --> 32:09.125
It entered her.

32:09.529 --> 32:12.168
It drowned her from the inside.

32:13.369 --> 32:16.202
Phoebe, in your vision,
what was Mom doing?

32:16.369 --> 32:19.839
She was using something
on the dock, some...

32:20.849 --> 32:23.124
- A wire?
- A power cable?

32:23.289 --> 32:27.282
Makes sense. Electricity is the only
thing that separates water particles.

32:28.569 --> 32:29.638
So...

32:30.409 --> 32:31.888
...what do we do differently?

32:32.049 --> 32:34.768
Maybe nothing. Sam,
would Mom's plan have worked

32:34.929 --> 32:36.965
- if she had finished it?
- Absolutely.

32:37.129 --> 32:40.644
But you said her power, my power,
it doesn't work against this demon.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.960
So that's it.

32:46.329 --> 32:50.880
We use Mom's plan
with one difference.

32:51.969 --> 32:54.324
The witch at the end of the dock
is not gonna be the one

32:54.489 --> 32:56.923
with the power to freeze.

32:58.489 --> 33:00.207
It's gonna be me.

33:10.329 --> 33:12.081
Are you ready?

33:12.249 --> 33:13.967
Yeah.

33:14.129 --> 33:16.848
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

33:17.009 --> 33:19.159
Just focus on the demon.
That's what this is about.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.287
Right.

33:22.929 --> 33:25.284
I forgot how good this feels.

33:26.209 --> 33:27.847
Really?

33:28.769 --> 33:30.999
How's it feel to be mortal?

33:31.729 --> 33:33.879
Why would you wanna know?

33:52.889 --> 33:55.084
Let's go face our demons.

34:14.728 --> 34:16.924
Okay, you in the water...

34:17.609 --> 34:20.203
...I know that you've been
waiting for this...

34:21.089 --> 34:22.806
...for me.

34:23.248 --> 34:24.967
Well, here I am,
so come and get me.

34:27.449 --> 34:29.599
You took what mattered most to me.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.886
And as long as I live,
you will never kill again.

34:39.529 --> 34:41.281
- Look out!
- Prue, behind you!

34:41.649 --> 34:43.321
Piper, wait!

34:45.168 --> 34:46.318
No!

34:50.449 --> 34:52.679
Not her! Take me!

34:58.729 --> 35:00.606
Stay back!

35:03.009 --> 35:04.283
Now!

35:12.929 --> 35:14.840
No. Sam.

35:18.489 --> 35:20.480
It's gone, it's gone.

35:22.049 --> 35:24.005
Leo, do something.

35:27.209 --> 35:28.801
What? Why isn't
anything happening?

35:29.849 --> 35:32.443
Because it's not meant to.

35:32.849 --> 35:36.444
- It's okay. It's time to go.
- No.

35:36.649 --> 35:39.402
I did what I've been waiting to do.

35:39.569 --> 35:42.322
I kept it from happening.
History won't repeat itself.

35:43.049 --> 35:46.086
- But you're going.
- I'm gonna see Patty again.

35:48.489 --> 35:50.445
Don't lose her.

35:58.009 --> 35:58.998
Patty?

36:04.209 --> 36:05.767
Patty?

36:09.169 --> 36:11.603
Say hi for me. For us.

36:51.729 --> 36:53.481
Jack.

36:55.049 --> 36:56.641
I have something to say, okay?

36:56.809 --> 36:59.482
I have worked at Buckland's
for a year and a half.

36:59.649 --> 37:01.879
And in that time, I've survived

37:02.049 --> 37:03.926
takeovers, near-bankruptcy

37:04.089 --> 37:07.206
and superiors from hell
who've tried to kill me.

37:07.369 --> 37:10.167
So whatever it is
that you're planning to do

37:10.329 --> 37:12.638
or have already done,

37:12.809 --> 37:15.607
nothing, and I mean nothing,
will surprise me.

37:16.809 --> 37:18.925
I just need you to sign this.

37:19.089 --> 37:22.161
It's the confirmation sheet
on the Fujimoto sale.

37:22.329 --> 37:24.126
You list me as the sales agent.

37:24.729 --> 37:27.527
Yeah, well, it was your deal,
wasn't it?

37:29.609 --> 37:32.077
You covered for me. I'm surprised.

37:33.809 --> 37:35.401
So...

37:36.809 --> 37:39.767
...what do you say, as a thank you...

37:42.569 --> 37:44.321
...I take you to dinner?

37:44.489 --> 37:46.559
But wouldn't that be breaking

37:46.729 --> 37:49.402
one of Prue Halliwell's
rules of etiquette?

37:49.929 --> 37:52.648
I've decided that even though
mixing business with pleasure

37:52.809 --> 37:56.643
can have its very
nasty consequences...

37:58.489 --> 38:02.368
...it can also bear
some fruitful rewards.

38:05.009 --> 38:06.362
So...

38:09.129 --> 38:10.687
...what's it gonna be?

38:10.849 --> 38:13.886
Nasty or fruitful?

38:14.449 --> 38:17.839
Well, that depends on
how you do at dinner.

38:26.849 --> 38:29.682
At least fighting this demon
came with a consolation prize.

38:30.249 --> 38:35.164
I mean, it didn't bring Mom back,
but these brought her closer.

38:35.329 --> 38:38.560
It's a good idea, Pheebs,
making a journal out of Mom's letters.

38:38.729 --> 38:40.799
Yeah, it's not as good
as the real thing, though.

38:41.329 --> 38:42.842
Nothing is.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.889
Tea. Want some tea?
I'm gonna go get some.

38:54.209 --> 38:55.847
Sure.

39:02.889 --> 39:04.845
I don't wanna interrupt.

39:05.009 --> 39:09.002
I think I can steep and talk
at the same time. Do you want any?

39:12.689 --> 39:14.520
It's just this...

39:14.689 --> 39:18.443
This whole situation, you know?
Sam, your mom,

39:18.609 --> 39:19.883
those letters.

39:22.089 --> 39:24.319
He loved her.

39:24.489 --> 39:25.717
Like...

39:28.409 --> 39:30.047
Like I love you.

39:32.809 --> 39:36.040
Leo, we've been through this before.
We both know how we feel, but there...

39:36.209 --> 39:38.200
There are things...

39:38.369 --> 39:39.961
...people involved now.

39:40.569 --> 39:42.764
Can you tell Dan the truth, Piper?

39:43.129 --> 39:44.960
That's between him and me.

39:46.689 --> 39:47.963
You and I have a job to do.

39:48.129 --> 39:51.041
And I thought we agreed
to try and put that first.

39:51.969 --> 39:55.279
So did Sam and your mom.
Look at the outcome.

39:57.209 --> 40:00.440
You're leaving, aren't you?
For good this time.

40:00.609 --> 40:03.169
I don't know. But I do know

40:03.329 --> 40:06.082
we have to stop
working together, because...

40:06.409 --> 40:08.400
...I can't stop loving you.

40:11.329 --> 40:13.718
Which means I can't do my job.

40:15.569 --> 40:17.685
And I can't do mine.

40:21.129 --> 40:23.723
I don't know how to say goodbye.

40:25.649 --> 40:27.207
Don't.

40:53.169 --> 40:54.887
Dan, what are you doing
at the back door?

40:55.049 --> 40:56.880
Well, when I knock
on the front door,

40:57.049 --> 40:59.119
I just never seem to make it
through the threshold.

41:00.489 --> 41:02.286
You hungry?

41:03.649 --> 41:05.480
Are you okay?

41:05.929 --> 41:07.328
Yeah, I'm just...

41:07.489 --> 41:08.717
I'm fine.

41:09.289 --> 41:11.644
Are you sure?
I mean, you can tell me.

41:13.009 --> 41:16.319
I know. I'm just not very hungry.

41:16.489 --> 41:17.478
Come on.

41:21.329 --> 41:23.524
Give it a try.

41:24.089 --> 41:26.762
Okay, I'll give it a try.
