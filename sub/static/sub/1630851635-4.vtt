Well, hello to you too.

00:33.241 --> 00:34.617
- You could have
just named names.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.244
- Why do you even care
who I sell to?

00:36.286 --> 00:38.872
- Look,
it's not about the drugs.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.416
It's about the hypocrisy.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.209
Look, man, I'm sure you have
a lot of customers

so pure and clean.

on you for selling

those assholes deserve

00:51.885 --> 00:54.596

Look, it's simple.

about you.

to sell to.

being a criminal

While police have not made
an official statement

01:32.634 --> 01:34.177
on the matter,

they're focusing
on the four students

with a history

01:39.182 --> 01:41.393
of drug-related arrests.

01:41.434 --> 01:44.062
Could this murder be tied
to the drug trade?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.397
Stay tuned.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.484
- That dead asshole might have
been right, Stan.

02:01.746 --> 02:04.249
- Why aren't you dressed?

02:04.290 --> 02:06.418
- Because I hate

like that?

this rumor that you cheated

04:53.126 --> 04:54.210

baseless accusation.

to inform the police

in Simon's murder.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.841
I mean, we know the cops think
we worked together,

so they're not gonna listen
to any other theories

10:34.759 --> 10:37.178
unless we have hard evidence.
But the media?

Those vultures will turn
the slightest hint of something

10:39.472 --> 10:40.849

10:40.890 --> 10:42.600
So if we set them
on the right trail,

10:42.642 --> 10:43.893
maybe the cops will follow.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.061

to do that?

it was just about the app.

anything new to say about us,

11:15.800 --> 11:17.135

something on Janae,

11:18.636 --> 11:20.388
and they won't
go through our trash.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.598

11:23.850 --> 11:26.686
I'm trying to be on ESPN,

11:33.026 --> 11:34.527

out of people.

to leak to the press.

do you actually expect me

11:54.756 --> 11:56.007
to believe it,
or do you just hope

11:56.049 --> 11:57.467
that I won't call you
out on it?

If you can't trust me,
then I guess

12:03.306 --> 12:04.432
I shouldn't trust you, either.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.975
- What's that supposed to mean?

12:06.017 --> 12:07.727
- Means that I finally
got into some of Simon's

12:07.769 --> 12:10.146

and I found something.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.732
But I'm not gonna show me until
you tell me where you were.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.161

some kind of murder club?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.500
That's what everyone's
calling it on Instagram.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.627
- That doesn't mean
you should call it that.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.337
If anything,
it's a mutual exoneration club

12:34.379 --> 12:35.463

Whoever's posting on About That
changed Cooper's secret,

that someone is Cooper.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.711
Slow down.
What did the original post say?

13:14.753 --> 13:16.004
- It doesn't matter.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.756
The point is that whoever
changed Cooper's post

13:17.797 --> 13:19.424
did it after Simon was dead.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.842
Who would do that
other than Cooper?

13:20.884 --> 13:24.596
- Well,
depends what the secret it.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.765
Are you gonna tell me?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.808
- Okay, but you have to promise

13:28.850 --> 13:30.769
you won't say anything
to anyone.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.396
- I promise.

13:34.731 --> 13:39.235

he's gay.

13:39.277 --> 13:42.655

13:42.697 --> 13:44.991
That's, um, unexpected.

Maeve thinks we should
just drop the laptop off

13:47.118 --> 13:48.703
at the police station
anonymously,

13:48.745 --> 13:51.122
but then, if Cooper isn't
the one that changed the post,

13:51.164 --> 13:52.374
and I've outed him
for no reason,

13:52.415 --> 13:53.708
then it's just unforgivable.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.669
But if he did change it,
the police need to know.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.003

13:57.045 --> 13:58.546

I couldn't sleep,

13:58.588 --> 14:02.050
and it sucks because we can't
do anything until tomorrow,

14:02.092 --> 14:03.885
and if I could sleep,
maybe I could see things

14:03.927 --> 14:05.970
a little bit more clearly,

a trick for that.

Janae, we both lost
our best friends,

22:34.187 --> 22:35.605
the men that we were
in love with,

22:35.647 --> 22:37.315
and I'm so glad
that I have someone

22:37.357 --> 22:39.401
to talk about this with,
and I want you to know

22:39.442 --> 22:41.319
that you can talk to me too
about anything--

22:41.361 --> 22:42.487
- Are you serious?

22:44.114 --> 22:45.240
- What?

22:48.368 --> 22:51.079
- First of all,
I wasn't in love with Simon.

22:51.121 --> 22:54.082
I'm gay, which you might know
if you ever paid attention

22:54.124 --> 22:55.834
to anyone other than yourself.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.336
And second of all, your shitty
little boyfriend dumped you.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.671
My best friend was murdered.

22:59.713 --> 23:02.298
It's not even remotely
the same thing.

23:02.340 --> 23:05.135

how fast guys respond

23:19.399 --> 23:21.234

to Maya Starr.

really into Cooper,

23:23.445 --> 23:24.738

by the murder rumors.

Now show me the messages.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.450

baseball with Cooper

23:30.118 --> 23:31.286
back in Mississippi,

23:31.327 --> 23:32.996
and I really think
he knows something.

23:33.038 --> 23:35.206
I've been really leaning
into the whole crush angle.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.750
Like, can I trust him?

23:36.791 --> 23:38.460
I know he's a great pitcher,
but people are saying

23:38.501 --> 23:40.545
he's a murderer.
I just don't want to get hurt.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.297
You know, woe is me--
- Maeve!

23:42.339 --> 23:43.757
Let me read.

23:51.264 --> 23:52.474
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.309
- He didn't say anything else?
- Nope.

23:54.351 --> 23:56.394
15 minutes,
and it's been radio silence.

we shouldn't skip this meeting?

25:04.671 --> 25:06.506
Maybe we should bring
the laptop to the police.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.883
- Can I point out
the movie was working?

25:08.925 --> 25:11.469
We--we turned it off
two seconds ago,

25:11.511 --> 25:12.887
and you're already
worried again.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.015

26:53.321 --> 26:55.907
- Are you Maya Starr?

26:55.949 --> 26:59.160
- Who?
- Travis figured it out.

26:59.202 --> 27:01.079
Wasn't very hard.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.915
He did a reverse image search
and found her real Instagram.

a new suspect.

27:11.923 --> 27:14.718

anyone other than Nate?

27:14.759 --> 27:18.096

27:18.138 --> 27:19.848
I heard your drug test
was negative,

27:19.889 --> 27:21.683

that your secret was

27:21.725 --> 27:23.268

at your house this morning,

- Then you could have asked me.

27:26.938 --> 27:28.773
Instead of catfishing
my friend like a psycho.

is in the fucking hospital.

He had a heart attack
this morning.

That's why the police
were at my house.

told him would have been a lie.
