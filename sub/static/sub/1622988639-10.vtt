[sighs]

00:15.765 --> 00:17.726
Hey. You guys go home. It's late.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.936
-We're not leaving you here alone.
-I'm fine.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.481
-Not until we hear from the doctor.
-I don't know what is taking so long.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.567
The CT results
should've been back hours ago.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.236
-Hey, she's gonna pull through. Okay?
-[Doc sighs]

00:28.319 --> 00:30.864
-Mel's right. We have to stay positive.
-Dr. Mullins?

00:30.947 --> 00:33.199
Yeah. Dr. Singh.
Did you get the test results?

00:33.283 --> 00:35.493
Yes, and I'm afraid it's not good news.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.246
In addition to her initial
contrecoup subdural hematoma,

00:38.329 --> 00:41.166
she's now developed
cerebral edema from her TBI.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.045
This is cause for concern
over potential herniation.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.130
Sorry, can someone translate, please?

00:47.213 --> 00:51.551
The impact from the crash
caused Hope's brain to bleed and swell,

00:51.634 --> 00:53.845
and now there's new swelling,

00:53.928 --> 00:56.806
and they're worried
that it could shift some brain tissue,

00:56.890 --> 00:58.600
which can be fatal.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.686
And I'm assuming
Hope will be going into surgery?

01:01.770 --> 01:03.855
She's about to be prepped for the OR.

01:03.938 --> 01:07.692
Okay. So, what are the treatment options
to control the swelling after surgery?

01:07.776 --> 01:08.985
We have two choices.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.529
We can put her
into a pentobarbital-induced coma,

01:11.613 --> 01:13.364
or we can increase her steroid intake.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.866
No, she has a heart condition.

01:14.949 --> 01:17.952
If you increase the steroids,
it could trigger a cardiac arrest.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.039
Which is why I'm recommending
the medically-induced coma.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.500
What's the thinking behind that?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.336
She's been in and out of consciousness.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.296
And if you decrease brain activity,

01:28.379 --> 01:31.424
that reduces the swelling
and allows the brain to heal faster.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.342
Got it.

01:32.425 --> 01:36.054
Of course, there are risks involved,
including impaired consciousness.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.390
[Mel] So you're saying
that she could remain unresponsive

01:39.474 --> 01:41.392
even after being weaned off sedation?

01:41.476 --> 01:42.393
[Dr. Singh] Correct.

01:43.728 --> 01:44.604
[Doc sighs]

01:44.687 --> 01:48.149
I'm sorry the news isn't better,
but you need to make a decision.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.318
[sighs heavily]

01:52.070 --> 01:55.156
If you think
inducing is the right way to go,

01:56.533 --> 01:58.076
I trust your judgment.

01:58.993 --> 01:59.828
Good.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.414
A member of our admin team
will be by with the paperwork.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.835
[Doc sighs]

02:08.753 --> 02:10.255
Doc, I'm so sorry.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.718
Look, Hope is strong, okay?
She's gonna get through this.

02:15.802 --> 02:16.719
Thanks.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.514
You want anything?
I'll go to the cafeteria.

02:19.597 --> 02:20.682
No, no.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.852
Are you okay?

02:23.935 --> 02:25.770
[Doc sighs deeply]

02:25.854 --> 02:27.147
I'm just worried.

02:28.606 --> 02:32.610
I have made so many mistakes
when it comes to Hope.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.532
[sighs] I just pray to God
this isn't another one.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.369

I got you a latte.

03:13.735 --> 03:14.777
Okay.

03:15.486 --> 03:16.696
I'll be right there.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.492
[Jack] So, Doc called.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.164
[exhales gently]

03:31.961 --> 03:32.879
Oh yeah?

03:34.631 --> 03:35.590
How's Hope?

03:35.673 --> 03:38.801
Surgery was a success.
Right now, she's stable.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.095
Oh, good. That's good.

03:42.096 --> 03:45.391
Um, I'm gonna get dressed,
and then we can go to the hospital.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.560
Mm. Doc said not to.

03:48.144 --> 03:52.148
-[Mel] He shouldn't be alone right now.
-That's what I told him, but he insisted.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.942
[Mel] Oh God, he's so stubborn.

03:54.525 --> 03:55.360
Yep.

03:55.860 --> 03:56.945
Here, let me help.

03:57.654 --> 04:01.699
But we have been there for, what,
ten days in a row now?

04:01.783 --> 04:05.286
Maybe he just wants
to have some time to himself.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.997
Yeah, I guess you're probably right.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.671
[Mel sighs heavily]

04:14.754 --> 04:15.797
So, uh,

04:17.257 --> 04:19.926
the last few weeks have been pretty tough.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.678
[Mel] Yeah.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.721
How about

04:24.639 --> 04:26.975
we get dinner tonight at the pier?

04:27.058 --> 04:30.228
Oh. Um, yeah.

04:30.311 --> 04:34.274
Well, I was kinda thinking
maybe we could just be alone tonight.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.483
Well, we will be.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.152
[sighs] No, I know,
but without other people around.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.238
Oh, okay.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.197
Okay.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.409
Well, how about a compromise?

04:44.492 --> 04:46.661
We could walk around the pier,

04:46.744 --> 04:47.954
then get takeout,

04:48.037 --> 04:50.373
come back here, have dinner,
just the two of us?

04:51.207 --> 04:52.083
Okay.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.710
That sounds nice.

I'm so sorry
this is happening to you guys.

-That's not very secure.
-I can remember it.

You know, whenever I'm feeling stressed
or sad, I like to listen to music,

06:35.395 --> 06:37.146

-Oh.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.365
Yeah, I picked mostly stuff
from the '60s and '70s,

-[Doc chuckles]

Anyway, since I don't know
what type of music you like,

06:55.706 --> 06:57.333
I went with the obvious choices.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.629
-Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, the Stones.
-Oh yeah, yeah, I like all three.

-I--
-Oh, never mind. I'll just use mine.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.850
This'll take a while to download,
so we will use my phone

07:13.933 --> 07:15.143

-Here, put those in.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.771
He's gonna ask a bunch of questions,
and after everything that's happened,

12:10.855 --> 12:13.149
I really can't handle
being cross-examined.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.487
I am so embarrassed.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.407
Mixing wine with Xanax and passing out…

12:21.490 --> 12:24.493
[scoffs] …is not something I am proud of.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.455
Well, no one is judging you. Really.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.331
No. I'm judging myself.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.503
You haven't known me for very long, right?
But this is not me.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.256
I'm someone who is
used to being in control.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.383
Nobody can be in control all the time.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.846
I just wanna go someplace new
and start over.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.306
[inhales deeply]

12:45.389 --> 12:47.808
Someplace where no one knows me. [sighs]

12:47.892 --> 12:48.851
Well, you know,

12:50.102 --> 12:52.772
pain doesn't just disappear.

12:53.397 --> 12:56.192
It follows you wherever you go
until you deal with it.

13:00.988 --> 13:03.240
Something happened back in Sacramento.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.120
Something that, uh…

13:08.204 --> 13:09.163
[inhales deeply]

13:10.206 --> 13:14.376
You know, Brie, you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.544
I want to.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.798
But you swear not to tell Jack.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.299
-Of course.
-I'm serious.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.551
I do not want him to know about this.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.928
I swear. I would never.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.433
So--

13:30.893 --> 13:32.144
[sighs awkwardly]

13:33.729 --> 13:34.730
God. [sniffles]

13:35.523 --> 13:37.358
This is harder than I thought.

13:37.441 --> 13:38.776
Just take your time.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.696
[inhales shakily]

13:42.780 --> 13:46.742
Six months ago, I started dating
that attorney I told you about.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.911
We met at a fundraiser,

13:48.994 --> 13:50.996
and he was smart

13:52.665 --> 13:53.916
and handsome,

13:54.917 --> 13:57.002
and our chemistry was insane.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.217
[sniffles quietly]

14:03.300 --> 14:05.094
And, uh… [inhales deeply]

14:06.136 --> 14:08.222
…one night we were together,

14:08.848 --> 14:12.351
and I was tired from working all day,

14:13.102 --> 14:14.812
so I told him, no.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.777
But he didn't stop.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.323
[sniffles]

14:27.408 --> 14:29.910
[breathes shakily]

14:31.871 --> 14:33.163
And when he was done,

14:34.665 --> 14:36.292
I started crying.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.793
And you know what he did?

14:40.880 --> 14:41.964
He got dressed

14:42.965 --> 14:45.593
and walked out without saying anything.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.344
Oh. Sweetheart.

14:50.139 --> 14:53.225
[cries] My miscarriage is from that night.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.020
Honey.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.813
[Brie cries quietly]

14:57.897 --> 14:59.607
Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.401
[sniffles]

15:13.329 --> 15:14.204
Sally.

15:15.497 --> 15:16.415
Hey.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.043
Thanks for seeing me.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.712
-[sighs quietly]
-[Sally] Is Christopher with you?

15:22.338 --> 15:24.548
No, um, he's at camp.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.591
Good.

15:26.842 --> 15:30.721
-I don't want him to know I'm here.
-So what's going on? Is Paige okay?

15:32.431 --> 15:34.183
Is there somewhere we can go talk?

15:35.392 --> 15:36.769
Somewhere more private?

15:38.687 --> 15:39.647
Okay.

15:40.522 --> 15:41.857
So where's Paige?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.817
She's in a cabin near the county line.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.862
-Just past Yeoman's Ridge.
-Why are you here instead of her?

15:46.946 --> 15:50.950
Paige wants to turn herself in,
but she wants to see Christopher first.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.994
No, we talked about this before she left.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.830
Now, if she goes to prison,
he'll end up in foster care,

15:56.914 --> 15:58.540
or worse, with Wes's family.

15:58.624 --> 16:02.628
Exactly, but she's so worn down from
being on the run, she won't listen to me.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.964
Then I… I need to see her.

16:05.589 --> 16:09.259
-Remind her what we talked about.
-That's what I was hoping you would say.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.387
[Sally] Come with me.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.139
-[Jack] Hey.
-Hi.

16:14.765 --> 16:18.268
-I didn't know you were coming by.
-I wasn't planning on it.

16:19.269 --> 16:23.691
-So, did you work things out with Todd?
-You could say that.

16:23.774 --> 16:27.403
Um, we actually got married, so…

16:29.196 --> 16:30.155
Wow.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.117
-When?
-Yesterday.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.953
Uh, at City Hall in Eureka.

16:36.036 --> 16:39.957
Well, uh, gotta admit, that's not
what I thought you were gonna say but, um,

16:40.958 --> 16:41.875
congratulations.

16:41.959 --> 16:45.004
Thanks. Yeah, I told him
I wasn't gonna move to Eureka

16:45.087 --> 16:46.755
unless we had a wedding date set,

16:46.839 --> 16:49.675
and he decided
that we didn't need to wait.

16:49.758 --> 16:50.884
Oh, that's great.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.471
You must be so happy.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.141
I was, yeah,

16:57.224 --> 17:00.144
until I found out
that you hired a family law attorney.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.396
Who told you that?

17:02.479 --> 17:05.024
Well, Todd was interviewing lawyers
to represent me,

17:05.107 --> 17:09.361
and the woman that he wanted to hire
said she had a conflict of interest,

17:09.445 --> 17:11.780
which he assumes is you.

17:11.864 --> 17:16.785
Look, I don't wanna fight.
I just want equal custody of the twins.

17:16.869 --> 17:20.080
Honestly, Jack,
I don't see that happening.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.041
And why not?

17:22.124 --> 17:24.835
Because Todd doesn't want you
involved with our family.

17:24.918 --> 17:27.671
Oh, I'm sorry,
you mean involved with my kids?

17:27.755 --> 17:31.091
Jack, I'm not gonna risk my marriage
in order to defend you.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.843
Charmaine, we…

17:34.303 --> 17:36.680
we are the twins'
biological parents, all right?

17:36.764 --> 17:40.142
Anything concerning them
should be between you and me.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.226
Nobody else.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.772
Look, until I have my own attorney,
Todd's representing me.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.690
So if you wanna talk about custody,

17:46.774 --> 17:48.984
your lawyer is gonna
have to discuss it with him.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.111
Charmaine. Hey, Charmaine!
Look at me. Look.

17:52.029 --> 17:56.200
Are you seriously gonna let this guy
keep me from seeing my own kids?

17:56.283 --> 17:59.119
He's my husband,
and he might not be perfect,

17:59.203 --> 18:01.663
but he is a good man,
and he'll be a dependable father.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.333
Those twins are my flesh and blood.

18:04.416 --> 18:08.045
How do you think they'll feel when
they realize you pushed their father away?

18:08.128 --> 18:12.424
Stop it. Stop trying to guilt me
into taking your side.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.426
-[Jack] I'm not--
-[Charmaine sighs]

18:15.427 --> 18:17.096
I'm not trying to guilt you.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.182
We're talking about our children's future.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.020
I have to go.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.238
Oh. Thanks.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.374
[sighs]

18:45.457 --> 18:46.917
I should've bought a large.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.337
No, that hit the spot.
You sure I can't pay for it?

18:50.420 --> 18:52.297
-It's just a soda.
-Yeah.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.424
Besides, I'm grateful for your help.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.260
I'll do anything for Paige.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.719
Me too.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.982
[motor starts]

19:23.120 --> 19:24.163
[tires squeal]

19:31.461 --> 19:33.755
-[Brady] What the hell was that?
-Going for a drive.

19:34.464 --> 19:35.549
[Calvin] Celebrating.

19:38.093 --> 19:42.181
Haven't you heard? It's official.
All charges against me were thrown out.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.141
They didn't have any evidence.

19:44.224 --> 19:47.519
No one was willing to testify,
not even Spencer.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.105
Yeah, well, good for you.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.442
I hear Emerald Lumber's
got you drowning in debt.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.072
I'd cover expenses for six months.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.868
Payroll, equipment, transport, all of it.
That'd get you back in the black.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.078
Yeah, and what's in it for you?

20:06.121 --> 20:09.625
I got my own debts to deal with,
so if you're open to diversification……

20:09.708 --> 20:12.669
No. No. I'm not running drugs for you.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.589
I'm not asking you to do anything
except look the other way.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.674
Sorry, not interested.

20:17.758 --> 20:22.179
Brady, my suppliers are gonna get
their money back one way or another.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.555
[chuckles]

20:23.639 --> 20:25.140
And if I can't give it to 'em,

20:25.849 --> 20:28.268
well, they're coming after you.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.520
That is, if you're not in prison.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.898
What are you talking about?

20:35.275 --> 20:37.110
Word is your alibi fell apart.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.615
You talking about Jack?
I got nothing to do with it.

20:41.698 --> 20:44.243
Then I guess you got
nothing to worry about.

20:48.580 --> 20:52.084
[motor starts]

21:03.553 --> 21:04.596
[Lizzie] Here you go.

21:07.766 --> 21:08.934
-Hey.
-What's up?

21:09.726 --> 21:12.020
-You've been ghosting me.
-I've been busy.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.523
I know I messed up.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.401
I should've told you
that I wanted to enlist.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.486
I'm really sorry.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.029
I don't want an apology.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.115
You seemed really upset at Lilly's house.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.366
I was.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.869
The reason I didn't tell you is because

21:29.037 --> 21:31.164
I was afraid
you'd talk me out of enlisting.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.000
And why would I do that?

21:33.083 --> 21:37.087
Because you wanna get married
and have babies and--

21:37.170 --> 21:38.130
Did I ever say that?

21:38.213 --> 21:40.632
We took a quiz on
how many kids we're going to have,

21:40.716 --> 21:42.676
and you wanna move in together and--

21:42.759 --> 21:44.344
That quiz was a joke.

21:44.428 --> 21:48.265
And moving in together doesn't mean
we're gonna get married. This isn't 1950.

21:50.392 --> 21:53.645
So what if I had told you,
what would you have said?

21:53.729 --> 21:57.024
Maybe I would've been upset,
but then I would've told you to go.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.900
And do you know why?

22:00.110 --> 22:01.778
Because I loved you,

22:02.404 --> 22:05.032
and I would've supported
whatever you wanted to do.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.617
Loved?

22:08.327 --> 22:09.494
Like past tense?

22:15.834 --> 22:17.711
Lizzie, I know I screwed up, but--

22:20.088 --> 22:21.256
Hey, babe.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.551
[Lizzie] Look, I don't need an apology.

22:24.634 --> 22:27.554
You live your life, and I'll live mine.

22:43.445 --> 22:47.032
[vehicle approaches]

22:54.539 --> 22:55.457
Hey!

22:56.875 --> 23:00.045
What are you, uh… What are you doing here?

23:01.797 --> 23:05.384
Uh, I thought you might wanna hang out.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.969
Yeah, I do.

23:40.752 --> 23:43.296
-The cabin's just down this hill.
-Okay.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.052
[exhales slowly]

23:51.054 --> 23:52.889
[quietly] Oh, what's going on?

23:55.475 --> 23:56.351
[Preacher] Just, uh…

23:58.395 --> 23:59.813
feel a little dizzy, uh…

24:05.527 --> 24:11.533
[tense music playing]

24:25.964 --> 24:26.923
[Brie chuckles]

24:27.632 --> 24:29.009
[movie playing]

24:29.092 --> 24:33.263
-You sure you don't have Legally Blonde?
-Ah, come on. You're gonna love it.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.056
Seven Oscars.

24:36.892 --> 24:37.851
Hey, come here.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.229
Oh man. You are all knotted up.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.690
Oh, that feels good.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.152
Yeah, well, as long as you're here,
I'll do whatever you want.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.196
Yeah, uh,

24:50.405 --> 24:51.490
about that.

24:52.115 --> 24:52.949
What?

24:53.033 --> 24:54.743
That's kind of why I came over.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.871
Um… I'm thinking
about leaving Virgin River.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.790
What, you gotta go back to work?

25:00.874 --> 25:02.083
No, it's not that.

25:03.126 --> 25:04.461
Then what is it?

25:04.544 --> 25:09.508
I've just been dealing with some stuff,
and it's too hard with Jack here, so…

25:11.092 --> 25:12.052
Oh.

25:13.678 --> 25:14.638
I see.

25:16.681 --> 25:17.849
[movie stops]

25:21.520 --> 25:22.812
What about us?

25:22.896 --> 25:23.897
Us?

25:24.773 --> 25:25.649
Yeah.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.985
Brie, I meant what I said.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.737
I'm falling in love with you.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.365
[Brady] You're all I think about.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.325
I'm sure that's not true.

25:35.408 --> 25:37.160
I wouldn't say it if it wasn't.

25:39.704 --> 25:43.375
This doesn't make sense.
You know that, right?

25:43.458 --> 25:45.001
My brother thinks you shot him.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.169
But I didn't.

25:47.462 --> 25:48.463
Look.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.260
The truth is, I…
I can't get enough of you.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.470
All I know is when we're together,

25:56.680 --> 25:57.973
there's this heat

25:59.140 --> 26:00.809
that I've never felt before.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.105
Do you know what I mean?

26:05.188 --> 26:07.232
Yeah, I do.

26:10.485 --> 26:11.736
Then stay.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.782
Just a little while longer.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.160
Give this a chance.

[groans softly]

26:22.622 --> 26:25.667
If I say yes,
I feel like I'm going to regret it.

26:27.794 --> 26:28.712
You won't.

26:30.005 --> 26:30.922
Promise.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.474
-[Tara] Hey, guys.
-Hey.

26:41.558 --> 26:43.351
Thanks for coming. Come on in.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.856
Here you go.

26:47.939 --> 26:51.151
Oh! Is this scalloped potatoes
and sausage?

26:51.234 --> 26:53.570
-[Jack] Preacher knows it's your favorite.
-[Tara chuckles]

26:53.653 --> 26:55.488
Oh, and an apple pie!

26:56.156 --> 26:58.241
So sweet of all of you. Thanks.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.242
[Mel] Yeah.

26:59.993 --> 27:02.537
Oh my gosh. I have such crazy news.

27:02.621 --> 27:03.622
[Mel] What?

27:03.705 --> 27:07.000
An anonymous donor
set up a trust for me and Chloe.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.251
Wow. That's incredible.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.753
[Tara] Yeah, I know.

27:09.836 --> 27:13.590
The trust will cover help and maintenance
for the farm, so we don't have to move.

27:13.673 --> 27:17.761
Oh, Tara, that is just--
That's amazing. I'm so happy for you.

27:17.844 --> 27:21.514
Thanks. I just wish I knew who it was
so I could thank them properly, you know?

27:21.598 --> 27:23.850
Yeah.
Well, your mom touched a lot of people.

27:23.933 --> 27:26.019
Yeah, she did.

27:27.103 --> 27:29.022
I have something for you. Wait right here.

27:29.105 --> 27:29.939
[Mel] Okay.

27:32.067 --> 27:36.029
Hm, gee,
I wonder who the benefactor could be.

27:36.112 --> 27:39.407
Well, I mean obviously somebody
that wants to remain anonymous.

27:39.491 --> 27:43.036
-Mm. Your secret's safe with me.
-How did you know it was me?

27:43.119 --> 27:46.831
Come on. Who else would be so generous
and refuse to take any credit?

27:46.915 --> 27:51.086
Oh. I just-- I don't want Tara
to feel indebted to me. That's all.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.003
Okay.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.464
What?

27:54.547 --> 27:57.008
-I'm just lookin' for your wings.
-[Mel chuckles]

27:57.092 --> 27:59.969
You sure you're not a guardian angel
disguised as a human being?

28:00.053 --> 28:01.054
[Tara] Mel.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.724
[Tara] Mom wanted you to have this.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.351
My father painted it.

28:06.434 --> 28:08.561
Oh my gosh, Tara. This is…

28:08.645 --> 28:12.482
It's beautiful, but I can't accept that.
That's a family heirloom.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.484
No, she wanted you to have it.

28:14.567 --> 28:17.987
She said if you ever leave, she wanted
you to have a piece of Virgin River.

28:18.071 --> 28:20.490
And if you don't take it,
she'll haunt both of us.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.576
Okay. Thank you.

28:33.461 --> 28:35.213
-[Brie] Extra salt?
-And butter.

28:35.296 --> 28:36.381
[Brie] Mmm.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.134
[Brady sighs]

28:39.884 --> 28:42.429
You are so freaking gorgeous.
You know that?

28:42.512 --> 28:44.597
Hm, that sounds familiar.

28:44.681 --> 28:45.932
[banging at door]

28:46.015 --> 28:47.851
-What the hell?
-Sheriff Duncan! Open up!

28:48.435 --> 28:49.853
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

28:49.936 --> 28:51.312
[banging at door]

28:51.396 --> 28:52.439
[Brady] Hold on!

28:55.442 --> 28:58.027
-[door opens]
-[Brady] What the hell is this?

28:58.111 --> 29:00.572
We're here to execute a search warrant
on the premises.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.949
-[Brady] You gotta be kidding me.
-May I see it?

29:05.118 --> 29:06.035
[Brady sniffs]

29:07.662 --> 29:08.872
You don't have a choice.

29:11.666 --> 29:14.502
Fine, but you're not gonna find anything.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.337
[Sheriff] All right, let's get to work!

29:21.885 --> 29:23.511

Brie, if you wanna stick around,
it's your call,

29:27.223 --> 29:30.226
but if you want my opinion,
you're wasting your time.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.936
You deserve a whole lot better.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.522
Why don't you, uh,
do what you gotta do and get out?

29:37.734 --> 29:40.153
[radio chatter]

29:51.372 --> 29:52.290
[door opens]

29:56.836 --> 29:57.796
Alrighty.

29:59.714 --> 30:00.840
Where do you think?

30:01.382 --> 30:02.509
Um…

30:02.592 --> 30:03.510
Here?

30:09.265 --> 30:10.725
Yeah, that looks good.

30:11.684 --> 30:14.312
[Jack] You want me
to throw some steaks on the grill?

30:15.146 --> 30:16.189
Um…

30:17.190 --> 30:19.442
Uh, no, thanks. I'm okay.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.321
Come on.
You hardly ate anything for breakfast.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.448
[Mel] I know. I just--

30:26.324 --> 30:28.743
-I think I'm gonna lay down.
-Yeah.

30:30.411 --> 30:32.747
[sighs, grunts]

30:34.457 --> 30:36.668
-[Mel groans softly]
-Can I get you something?

30:36.751 --> 30:40.046
No, no, I'm fine.
I think I just need to get some sleep.

30:41.881 --> 30:42.799
Okay.

30:42.882 --> 30:45.552
Hm. Oh, honey, I'm sorry about tonight.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.637
I know you tried
to plan something special.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.055
Oh, it's okay.

30:51.766 --> 30:56.062
Maybe we could get up early.
We could watch the sunrise.

30:56.604 --> 30:59.440
-If you're feeling better.
-That sounds nice.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.067
[inhales slowly]

31:01.150 --> 31:03.945
Why don't you just
wake me when you get up?

31:04.028 --> 31:04.904
[sighs softly]

31:05.697 --> 31:06.614
[quietly] Okay.

31:10.285 --> 31:11.119
Here.

31:12.328 --> 31:13.329
I love you.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.499
I love you too.

31:47.864 --> 31:50.366
Sorry, there's no alcohol in the house.

31:50.992 --> 31:51.951
Well…

31:54.329 --> 31:55.204
there is now!

31:55.288 --> 31:57.457
Parker, if Connie finds out, she'll freak.

31:57.540 --> 32:01.502
Chill. You are so uptight.
You need to get out of here.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.588
I told you, I don't wanna go back to LA.

32:03.671 --> 32:04.505
Why not?

32:04.589 --> 32:08.551
It's too expensive to get my own place,
and I don't wanna live with my parents.

32:09.510 --> 32:11.846
-I don't wanna go back either.
-What about the club?

32:11.930 --> 32:13.598
I'm not about that anymore.

32:13.681 --> 32:14.766
Uh-huh.

32:15.642 --> 32:16.935
I'm being serious.

32:17.977 --> 32:20.480
-I'm gonna road trip cross-country.
-With who?

32:20.563 --> 32:24.067
If it's Dave, don't let him drive
'cause he's baked, like, 99% of the time.

32:24.150 --> 32:27.278
The only person I wanna go with is you.

32:28.029 --> 32:30.573
-What are you talking about?
-It'd be an adventure!

32:30.657 --> 32:33.868
Just the two of us
going wherever we want, whenever we want.

32:34.535 --> 32:38.456
You wanna see the Grand Canyon? Done.
You wanna go to Miami? We're there.

32:38.539 --> 32:41.042
Parker, we're not getting back together.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.168
Why not?

32:42.251 --> 32:43.795
Because I don't trust you.

32:44.545 --> 32:48.591
Okay, I know I screwed up.
I never should've hooked up with Olivia.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.343
So now you regret sleeping with her?

32:50.426 --> 32:53.137
Of course I do!
It was stupid and immature.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.808
-I was just frustrated that you--
-Don't blame me. That's weak.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.977
I know. I'm sorry.

32:59.602 --> 33:00.603
For real.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.355
L.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.149
I love you.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.904
Please, give me another chance.

33:11.114 --> 33:14.492
-I can't just pick up and leave.
-Why? What's keeping you here?

33:37.974 --> 33:38.933
[door opens]

33:48.901 --> 33:51.696
Oh! Good evening. How can I help you?

33:51.779 --> 33:53.406
Uh, I'd like a room.

33:53.489 --> 33:56.409
Okay.
I'll need to see some identification.

33:56.993 --> 33:57.827
I'm 19.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.829
Still need proper ID.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.752
Oh, you're from Seattle.

34:05.835 --> 34:06.919
[both chuckle]

34:07.003 --> 34:10.882
I have a friend who used to live there.
I hear it's a beautiful city.

34:10.965 --> 34:11.883
It's okay.

34:12.383 --> 34:16.220
So, um, what brings you to town,
if you don't mind me asking?

34:16.804 --> 34:19.265
Uh, yeah, I'm looking for my grandfather.

34:19.348 --> 34:22.185
Oh, well, I know almost everyone in town.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.394
What's his name?

34:24.020 --> 34:25.688
Dr. Vernon Mullins.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.867
-[Doc] Hey!
-Hey!

34:37.950 --> 34:39.494
How long have you been here?

34:39.577 --> 34:43.122
Just a few minutes. I figured
you'd have to come back at some point.

34:43.206 --> 34:46.918
Oh, I was in the cafeteria.
If I'd known, I'd have brought you a cup.

34:47.001 --> 34:48.252
Oh, I'm fine.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.671
It's you I'm worried about.

34:51.464 --> 34:52.465
How are you?

34:53.216 --> 34:54.300
[sighs] I'm good.

34:55.635 --> 34:56.677
[Doc hesitates]

34:56.761 --> 34:58.054
I'm not good. I'm…

34:59.347 --> 35:00.932
surviving. [inhales sharply]

35:01.015 --> 35:02.100
Okay.

35:02.183 --> 35:07.146
Well, I have a little something here
for Hope that just might cheer you up.

35:09.816 --> 35:10.733
Oh.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.694
The girls and I made a photo blanket

35:13.778 --> 35:16.739
so that when Hope wakes up,
she will see everyone who loves her.

35:16.823 --> 35:20.910
I don't know what to say.
That's just marvelous. Thank you.

35:20.993 --> 35:22.411
-[Muriel] Aw.
-Thank you.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.413

35:24.497 --> 35:26.666
-Do you want me to go--
-No, stay, please.

35:26.749 --> 35:29.043
-Is everything all right?
-She's developed a fever.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.294
Oh God, not an infection.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.630
I've ordered a chest CT
and a full blood panel.

35:32.713 --> 35:35.341
I'll let you know more
as soon as I have the results.

35:35.883 --> 35:37.260
Uh, thank you.

35:39.846 --> 35:40.930

35:51.941 --> 35:55.194
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.280

35:58.030 --> 35:59.949
I no longer believe that's true.

36:00.783 --> 36:02.243
[exhales deeply]

36:02.326 --> 36:04.787
I should've called her
when I found out about Lilly,

36:04.871 --> 36:06.455
and she'd have come home.

36:06.539 --> 36:09.625
She wouldn't have been on the road
when the damn truck crossed--

-Vernon.
-[Doc sobs]

36:11.252 --> 36:13.629
[Muriel] Come on now.
You can't think like that.

36:13.713 --> 36:14.714
[Doc sobs]

36:14.797 --> 36:17.633
I know, but it feels like
she's just slipping away,

36:18.926 --> 36:21.721
and there's not a goddamn thing I can do.

36:23.764 --> 36:26.100
[Doc cries softly]

36:30.062 --> 36:34.650
-So when's Preach coming home?
-I thought he'd be home by now.

Wait. So you mean
this whole pizza's just for us?

39:25.988 --> 39:31.327
I had been so numb for so long,
I couldn't feel anything at that point.

39:33.579 --> 39:34.538
I know.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.667
But you were brave enough
to open up to me.

39:41.003 --> 39:42.922
For that, I am forever grateful.

39:44.173 --> 39:49.303
[gentle instrumental music playing]

39:57.311 --> 39:58.521
There's something that…

39:59.397 --> 40:03.067
[exhales] …I've been wanting to ask you.

40:05.611 --> 40:06.529
-Oh my God.
-Hang on.

40:06.612 --> 40:08.697
-I wanna get this exactly right.
-Wait, Jack.

40:08.781 --> 40:11.867
-No, give me a second.
-I have to tell you something.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.286
I'm… I'm pregnant.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.331
You're pregnant?

40:17.415 --> 40:20.126
I wanted to tell you yesterday,
but with Doc and everything,

40:20.209 --> 40:21.293
it was just so much.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.587
No, no, no. Hey, this is good.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.214
[Mel groans softly]

40:26.090 --> 40:29.093
This is good.
I told you I was all-in, and I meant it.

40:30.052 --> 40:33.431
This isn't exactly
how I thought it would go, but… [chuckles]

40:33.514 --> 40:34.515
Oh, honey.

40:34.598 --> 40:36.642
Mel, we're having a baby!

40:37.351 --> 40:39.145
I can't believe this. This, um…

40:40.396 --> 40:42.523
-This is amazing news.
-No, it's not.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.150
Hey, come on. What--

40:45.359 --> 40:47.486
Hey, whatever it is, we'll get through it.

40:52.491 --> 40:55.286
Jack, I don't know if you're the father.

40:57.121 --> 41:01.083
[tense music playing]

41:06.505 --> 41:11.635
