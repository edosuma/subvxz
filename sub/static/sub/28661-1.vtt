00:11.338 --> 00:13.047
<i>Good morning, winner.</i>

00:13.130 --> 00:14.963
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

00:17.338 --> 00:18.422
<i>Good.</i>

00:18.505 --> 00:20.922
<i>You're ready to dominate this day.</i>

00:22.088 --> 00:24.588
<i>You've worked harder than everyone,</i>

00:24.672 --> 00:27.880
<i>and that is why you're a champion.</i>

00:28.380 --> 00:31.797
<i>You understand that greatness
takes sacrifice.</i>

00:32.671 --> 00:35.463
<i>Visualize what you still want to achieve.</i>

00:36.172 --> 00:38.755
<i>Stand atop the mountain of your success</i>

00:38.838 --> 00:41.463
<i>and look down at everyone</i>

00:41.547 --> 00:43.547
<i>who's ever doubted you.</i>

00:44.547 --> 00:46.088
<i>Fuck those losers.</i>

00:46.297 --> 00:50.630
<i>Fuck them in their stupid fucking faces.</i>

00:58.297 --> 01:00.005
Hey!

01:00.088 --> 01:01.588
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:01.672 --> 01:02.672
Oh, shit.

01:04.212 --> 01:05.588
Hold the phone!

01:06.005 --> 01:07.047
I'm comin'!

01:07.922 --> 01:09.630
Oh, shit.

01:09.713 --> 01:12.088
Whoo!

01:16.505 --> 01:18.505
- What?
- What? Excuse me.

01:19.130 --> 01:20.338
- Oh, oh.
- What?

01:20.422 --> 01:21.505
- Oh.
- What?

01:21.588 --> 01:22.588
- Hey.
- What?

01:22.672 --> 01:24.422
- Missed ya!
- I missed you.

01:25.047 --> 01:26.847
- I missed you so much.
- It's been one night.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.130
- Are we gonna go to school, or...
- No.

01:32.255 --> 01:33.255
I don't think we are.

01:33.297 --> 01:35.880
No, we're just gonna stay... here.

01:47.963 --> 01:49.672
- Move!
- Jeez!

01:55.630 --> 01:57.463
Are you...

01:57.547 --> 01:59.338
- Whoo!
- I swear to God.

01:59.922 --> 02:00.981
- Whoo!
- What are you doing?

02:01.005 --> 02:03.725
- Are you kidding me? Samantha!
- You couldn't have just gone around?

02:03.838 --> 02:06.838
Where was this energy
at my inauguration assembly, folks?

02:06.922 --> 02:07.755
True.

02:07.838 --> 02:11.463
I hope I never have
to see any of you ever again, okay?

02:11.547 --> 02:12.797
That's it. Signin' off.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.380
Go, Crocketts!

02:15.380 --> 02:16.380
Boom.

02:16.922 --> 02:19.422
- Principal Brown?
- Oh...

02:20.088 --> 02:22.255
Hi, Molly, Amy. What's shakin'?

02:22.338 --> 02:24.814
I want to make the transition
of next year's student government

02:24.838 --> 02:25.838
as seamless as possible,

02:25.880 --> 02:29.297
- so that when I'm up in New Haven...
- Yale. You can just say Yale, please.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.088
Well, our class's official policy
is to not discuss

02:32.172 --> 02:33.612
where anyone is attending next year.

02:33.672 --> 02:35.588
We don't want them to feel insecure.

02:35.672 --> 02:36.547
Very thoughtful.

02:36.630 --> 02:39.047
I need to go over the end of the year
budget numbers we have.

02:40.380 --> 02:41.380
Gosh.

02:41.922 --> 02:42.922
Really?

02:43.088 --> 02:44.088
Like, now?

02:44.630 --> 02:47.047
I mean, why don't you do it with Nick?
You know, please?

02:47.130 --> 02:49.090
I mean, he's... you know,
he's the vice president.

02:49.130 --> 02:50.130
Nick?

02:50.755 --> 02:52.422
Oh!

02:52.505 --> 02:55.338
We both know that Nick only ran for VP
because they plan the dances.

02:55.422 --> 02:56.588
That position is...

02:57.338 --> 02:59.422
It's basically a popularity contest.
He's useless.

02:59.505 --> 03:01.797
Ladies, it's the last day, you know?

03:02.463 --> 03:03.463
We did it, huh?

03:03.505 --> 03:05.005
We got you through high school.

03:05.088 --> 03:07.088
Can't we just graduate,
head off to college,

03:07.172 --> 03:09.755
you know,
celebrate this wonderful achievement?

03:09.838 --> 03:12.273
Let's get through the day
without anything horrible happening.

03:12.297 --> 03:14.977
Sorry, are you shutting the door on us?
Not subtle. We will persist!

03:16.338 --> 03:18.255
Nick's like the great equalizer.

03:19.338 --> 03:23.422
Delegates from every group of girls
are casting their ballots for his penis.

03:23.755 --> 03:25.422
Oh, Triple A takes the lead.

03:26.005 --> 03:27.422
Don't call her that.

03:27.505 --> 03:28.880
Everybody calls her that.

03:28.963 --> 03:31.323
She gave roadside assistance
to three senior guys last year.

03:31.630 --> 03:33.547
You hear them
getting degrading nicknames?

03:33.630 --> 03:35.255
They call Sam Ross "Dick Splinter."

03:35.588 --> 03:38.213
That's not derogatory,
it's a factual description.

03:38.713 --> 03:40.755
- 7:20.
- Under eight minutes?

03:40.838 --> 03:42.297
- You're joking!
- Aah!

03:42.380 --> 03:44.213
Oh, my God. 9:43.

03:44.297 --> 03:46.213
What am I gonna do
without you girls next year?

03:46.297 --> 03:48.097
Nobody around here
even attempts the Thursday.

03:48.172 --> 03:50.922
Well, Amy and I are gonna Skype
the puzzle every single week,

03:51.005 --> 03:52.731
- so we will send you our Sunday <i>Times.</i>
- Yep.

03:52.755 --> 03:54.915
You know what?
Why don't I just give you two my number?

03:54.963 --> 03:58.005
That way, you guys can call or text me
if you need anything.

03:58.422 --> 04:00.672
- Yeah! That would make our lives.
- Yeah. Cool.

04:00.755 --> 04:01.963
- We'd love that.
- Definitely.

04:02.047 --> 04:04.213
- I'll give you mine after.
- I'll share the contact.

04:04.297 --> 04:05.481
- I can give...
- I'll share it.

04:05.505 --> 04:08.380
Wait. Miss Fine, I thought there were
no cell phones allowed in class.

04:08.463 --> 04:10.963
- Or are there exceptions for ass-kissers?
- Hey.

04:11.463 --> 04:12.547
A dollar in the swear jar.

04:12.630 --> 04:15.380
I'm so sorry.
These shorts, they don't have pockets.

04:15.463 --> 04:18.297
- Okay, excuse me. Excuse me. Jesus Christ!
- Whoa, Triple A!

04:18.380 --> 04:19.380
Oh, my God.

04:19.422 --> 04:21.981
- No spatial awareness at this school.
- People just really don't.

04:22.005 --> 04:23.255
- Hey, Amy?
- It's her!

04:23.755 --> 04:24.588
Yeah?

04:24.672 --> 04:26.672
Did you just score
your teacher's phone number?

04:27.130 --> 04:28.130
Yeah.

04:28.172 --> 04:29.338
Nice.

04:32.713 --> 04:33.880
Hey, Miss Fine?

04:33.963 --> 04:35.588
You should come party with us tonight.

04:35.672 --> 04:38.880
Did you just ask Miss Fine
if she wants to party with you?

04:38.963 --> 04:41.314
You think she wants to watch you
get drunk and break things?

04:41.338 --> 04:44.380
Hold on. I was having a conversation
with her. You're not part of this.

04:44.463 --> 04:45.463
- I'm...
- Sit down, Theo.

04:45.505 --> 04:47.755
Yo, yo. What up, Miss Fine?

04:48.130 --> 04:50.172
Just a last day present
for my favorite teach.

04:50.255 --> 04:53.047
- Jared, you are not my student.
- I've heard great things.

04:53.130 --> 04:56.380
And, hey, everybody else
got their graduation gifts, right?

04:56.672 --> 04:57.672
Come on.

04:57.713 --> 04:59.838
Jare Bear coming at you
from all angles, right?

04:59.922 --> 05:01.148
- Nobody asked for that.
- Uhh...

05:01.172 --> 05:04.213
Big me, littler me,
little baby Jared at the bottom.

05:04.297 --> 05:06.463
Baby Jared says,
"Happy graduation, everybody!"

05:06.547 --> 05:09.713
Yeah, no one's gonna wear a shirt
with your face on it, Jared.

05:09.797 --> 05:11.463
Like, not even ironically.

05:11.547 --> 05:13.838
Okay, well, agree to disagree, 'cause...

05:13.922 --> 05:15.213
Jared, just go.

05:15.297 --> 05:17.547
I'm out of here. Wasn't even here.
See you, Molly.

05:18.047 --> 05:19.713
- Bye, Molly.
- I'll see ya.

05:19.797 --> 05:20.939
Bye, Molly.

05:20.963 --> 05:23.588
- Why does he always do that?
- Fair townspeople!

05:23.672 --> 05:25.172
Fair townspeople?

05:25.797 --> 05:27.255
Fair townspeople, I swear to God!

05:27.338 --> 05:30.088
- What?
- Mark thy calendars

05:30.172 --> 05:34.172
and make thy plans to attend
the drama department's summer program,

05:34.505 --> 05:36.922
Shakespeare in the Park... ing Lot.

05:37.963 --> 05:42.088
We will be performing the Bard's comedies
as modern tragedies

05:42.172 --> 05:44.213
outside Whole Foods across town.

05:44.297 --> 05:45.657
Well, it's actually funny. It's...

05:45.713 --> 05:47.505
It's what we did in my summer program

05:47.588 --> 05:49.588
- last year in...
- Barcelona,

05:49.672 --> 05:51.463
when I lived in Barcelona.

05:51.547 --> 05:53.047
I will be directing,

05:53.505 --> 05:54.963
and Alan...

05:55.588 --> 05:58.047
may be starring, pending auditions.

05:58.547 --> 06:00.213
I don't audition.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.297
I'm offer only.

06:03.005 --> 06:05.922
This looks fun, but I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna be here.

06:06.255 --> 06:08.005
Yeah, Amy's spending the summer
in Botswana,

06:08.088 --> 06:09.630
helping women make their own tampons.

06:09.713 --> 06:10.713
That's...

06:11.005 --> 06:11.838
gross.

06:11.922 --> 06:14.630
Well, blood attracts lions.
I'm saving lives.

06:14.713 --> 06:18.422
Oh, okay. Well, that's actually noble.
I, too, have a fear of big cats.

06:18.505 --> 06:22.255
And I can't because I'm working
all summer, and also, I don't want to.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.255
You are a philistine.

06:23.338 --> 06:25.380
Why would you do theater
when you could do debate?

06:25.463 --> 06:27.922
Because some of us
enjoy working with others.

06:28.005 --> 06:29.547
And some of us know how to win.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.338
Nobody's winning in that outfit.

06:31.422 --> 06:33.262
Sit down, y'all.
We got work to do.

06:33.297 --> 06:35.088
- So, Molly...
- Mmm?

06:35.172 --> 06:36.812
- Why don't you start us off?
- Thank you.

06:36.880 --> 06:37.755
Kill it.

06:37.838 --> 06:40.463
All right, well, as you might recall
from my analysis yesterday,

06:40.547 --> 06:42.314
- we were talking about...
- It's our last day!

06:42.338 --> 06:44.273
- Let us live! God!
- ...submitting to authority...

06:44.297 --> 06:45.422
You've gotta open...

06:45.505 --> 06:48.380
You've gotta open your mouth
a little bit more, all right?

06:48.463 --> 06:50.343
- Yeah, okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.
- Okay, chips!

06:50.380 --> 06:52.273
- All right, this is it.
- I gotcha. Ready?

06:52.297 --> 06:54.564
- Dude, how am I supposed to get there?
- That was my bad.

06:54.588 --> 06:55.630
- Nick?
- You're wild.

06:55.713 --> 06:57.513
- Nick.
- Wait, just one sec. Just... come on.

06:57.588 --> 06:59.731
Nick, there's some student government
stuff to go over.

06:59.755 --> 07:00.995
Come on, man, aim for my mouth!

07:01.047 --> 07:03.439
We have to go over the end of year budget,
so if you could...

07:03.463 --> 07:06.255
Yeah, just, we're playin' this game
where I've gotta catch it with...

07:06.338 --> 07:08.458
It's complicated.
I'll... I'll hit you later, I guess.

07:08.505 --> 07:09.880
I'm sure it's complicated.

07:09.963 --> 07:10.797
Oh!

07:10.880 --> 07:14.922
I cannot believe I lasted an entire year
with Nick as my vice president.

07:15.297 --> 07:17.797
He's allergic to work.
All he wants to do is goof off.

07:17.880 --> 07:18.880
It's infuriating.

07:31.588 --> 07:32.838
Go talk to Ryan.

07:33.797 --> 07:34.963
What? No.

07:36.047 --> 07:38.463
Cool, cool, 'cause I'm...
I'm gonna go talk to Ryan.

07:38.547 --> 07:40.588
- 'Cause I have so much to say...
- No, no, no.

07:44.672 --> 07:45.838
- Yeah?
- Fine.

07:46.047 --> 07:47.672
Just... I'm going.

07:47.838 --> 07:49.422
- Just gonna...
- There she goes.

08:02.130 --> 08:03.981
- Oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Oh, dude.

08:04.005 --> 08:04.838
Amy.

08:04.922 --> 08:06.463
- It's all good.
- Here you go.

08:06.547 --> 08:07.713
Sharp elbows.

08:07.797 --> 08:09.713
Not as sharp as your... chin.

08:10.172 --> 08:11.172
What?

08:11.547 --> 08:13.880
Um... so isn't it crazy
that it's... it's the last day?

08:13.963 --> 08:15.963
I know, dude. I can barely believe it.

08:16.047 --> 08:17.672
Are you gonna come to Nick's tonight?

08:17.755 --> 08:19.755
His aunt went on a cruise ship
that broke down,

08:19.838 --> 08:21.588
so Nick's gonna throw a party
at her house.

08:21.672 --> 08:23.088
That's... that's awesome.

08:23.588 --> 08:24.713
It's... it's all right.

08:24.797 --> 08:27.463
They're, you know, they're stuck
on a boat shitting in buckets.

08:27.547 --> 08:29.005
Oh, that's not really what I meant.

08:29.547 --> 08:30.922
Oh, Jesus.

08:31.005 --> 08:32.804
- Come on, Tanner.
- All right, well...

08:33.337 --> 08:35.005
All right, I'll see you later.

08:35.380 --> 08:36.422
I'll just, um...

08:37.005 --> 08:38.255
Fuck. Fuck, fuck.

08:38.337 --> 08:40.058
- What are you doing? Go back.
- Fuck, fuck.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.727
No, that was bad. That was bad. I'm good.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.337
I don't even know if she's into girls.

08:43.422 --> 08:44.838
She wore a polo shirt to prom.

08:44.922 --> 08:47.297
Well, that's just her gender performance.

08:47.380 --> 08:49.060
It's different from
her sexual orientation.

08:49.130 --> 08:50.505
I'm sorry, but I don't get it.

08:50.588 --> 08:54.297
- Well, gender is a construct of...
- No. Thank you. That much I understand.

08:54.380 --> 08:56.588
It's just... it's a little bit shocking

08:56.672 --> 08:58.338
that... that you're into Ryan.

08:58.755 --> 09:01.422
First crush, the little white cat
from <i>The Aristocats.</i>

09:01.505 --> 09:03.130
You go from that to Avril Lavigne.

09:03.213 --> 09:05.297
It just... it's not...
it's not what I anticipated.

09:05.380 --> 09:06.880
I just like that she's...

09:07.755 --> 09:10.588
always in a good mood,
and she's got a really cute smile.

09:11.088 --> 09:13.797
She just seems like
she'd be a really fun person

09:13.880 --> 09:15.797
to have sleepovers and lie around with.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.297
Excuse me, pardon me? I'm a fun person
to have sleepovers and lie around with.

09:19.380 --> 09:20.463
It's literally all we do.

09:20.547 --> 09:22.672
Well, with her, there'd be more...

09:24.213 --> 09:25.338
vagina involved.

09:25.838 --> 09:26.838
That's fair.

09:27.088 --> 09:28.713
She said Nick's having a party tonight.

09:28.797 --> 09:31.838
Of course he would.
He's so fucking stupid.

09:31.922 --> 09:34.797
Somebody always gets arrested
the night before graduation.

09:36.547 --> 09:39.588
Amy, do you know how many girls
are gonna be up your vagina

09:39.672 --> 09:40.981
at Columbia next year?

09:41.005 --> 09:43.047
Are you aware of it?
'Cause I'm aware of it.

09:43.130 --> 09:46.630
Every time I come to visit you, you're
just gonna be scissoring a different girl.

09:46.713 --> 09:47.797
Dude?

09:47.880 --> 09:49.172
Scissoring is not a thing.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.880
- Don't knock it until you've tried it.
- It's not a thing.

09:51.963 --> 09:55.123
- I'm not knocking it. It's not a thing.
- Don't knock it until you've tried it.

10:02.130 --> 10:03.588
Here comes the one percent.

10:12.672 --> 10:14.297
That car belongs in a museum.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.630
What the fuck, Jared?
I said door-to-door.

10:16.713 --> 10:19.922
Museum of death,
'cause its smog is killing us all.

10:21.047 --> 10:23.130
- Fuck!
- You all right?

10:23.213 --> 10:25.838
They spend every minute together.
It's so weird.

10:25.922 --> 10:27.505
We spend every minute together.

10:27.588 --> 10:28.505
We are equals.

10:28.588 --> 10:30.963
Gigi just keeps Jared around
for when she needs a liver.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.356
- No, please don't get on my car.
- I'm fucking spent, Jared!

10:33.380 --> 10:35.314
- At least take the heels off.
- I'm fucking spent!

10:35.338 --> 10:37.731
- I just got it back from the shop.
- Okay, shh! I'm napping.

10:37.755 --> 10:41.547
Do you think it's true that his dad got
him a sex worker for his 14th birthday?

10:41.630 --> 10:44.047
It's too weird of a story to be made up.

10:44.130 --> 10:45.797
There's so many specifics.

10:45.880 --> 10:48.213
He sprained his ankle,
she had a hearing aid.

10:48.297 --> 10:49.422
What up, <i>chicas?</i>

10:49.505 --> 10:50.755
It's intolerable.

10:50.838 --> 10:51.958
You guys... you guys hungry?

10:52.005 --> 10:54.297
I got... I got some soup dumps.

10:54.380 --> 10:56.088
Keep it down out there!

10:56.172 --> 10:58.172
They're probably soggy now,
but they're great cold!

10:58.213 --> 10:59.231
- Good Lord.
- S'all right.

10:59.255 --> 11:01.439
I'm going to pee in your weird bathroom.
Watch my stuff.

11:01.463 --> 11:04.380
Until all of us can pee without genitals,
none of us can.

11:05.130 --> 11:07.005
These motherfuckers.

11:07.755 --> 11:08.755
"Your ugly" what?

11:09.547 --> 11:11.213
How did you graduate sixth grade?

11:11.297 --> 11:12.922
It's shocking to me.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.172
So, okay, so, I win.

11:15.255 --> 11:17.380
- Marry the sex doll, okay?
- Right.

11:17.463 --> 11:19.189
- Fuck the soccer ball.
- Yep.

11:19.213 --> 11:20.547
And then, kill Molly.

11:20.630 --> 11:22.297
Dude, no!

11:22.380 --> 11:23.505
There's no other way, dude.

11:23.588 --> 11:25.380
Like, I can't fuck her,
you know, 'cause...

11:25.463 --> 11:27.505
when I'm scared, my dick can't get hard.

11:27.588 --> 11:29.755
And then, like, I can't marry her,
'cause, well,

11:29.838 --> 11:31.963
- I don't believe in the institution.
- Uh-huh.

11:32.047 --> 11:33.713
So I have to kill Molly.

11:33.797 --> 11:35.922
And I know it'll haunt me.
I'm a peaceful person.

11:36.005 --> 11:37.963
That's very true.

11:38.047 --> 11:40.047
Wait, are you guys talking
about Molly Davidson?

11:40.130 --> 11:40.963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:41.047 --> 11:43.963
That girl is so weird.
She always acts like she's, like, 40.

11:44.047 --> 11:47.148
I wish she was fuckin' 40, man.
Women in their forties know themselves.

11:47.172 --> 11:50.047
Oh, she's cute,
you know, yeah, I give her that,

11:50.130 --> 11:53.463
but she'd probably make you quiz her
on her SAT analogies while you fuck her.

11:53.547 --> 11:57.005
Dude, no, her vagina is probably stuffed
with diplomas, how much do you wanna bet?

11:57.088 --> 11:59.047
That shit's like a filing cabinet
down there.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.838
Well, I've got no problem
with a filing cabinet.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.880
I would make passionate sex
to Molly Davidson.

12:04.963 --> 12:06.005
Really?

12:06.088 --> 12:08.422
Yeah, I'd just put a bag
over her personality.

12:08.505 --> 12:10.172
- Yeah.
- That's it.

12:10.255 --> 12:13.463
Molly's like a butterface for personality,
a butter personality.

12:13.547 --> 12:15.255
Yeah!

12:16.338 --> 12:17.963
- It's so bad.
- Yeah.

12:18.047 --> 12:20.672
That's cool, man. What?

12:22.047 --> 12:23.047
Shit.

12:26.547 --> 12:27.547
Oh.

12:27.963 --> 12:30.130
Oh, please, do not stop on my account.

12:31.088 --> 12:34.463
Do you know what?
My vag is stuffed with diplomas.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.505
Soon it's gonna be stuffed
with job offers,

12:37.588 --> 12:41.255
and glowing profiles,
and commendations from the governor.

12:41.338 --> 12:45.255
So, while you guys
were all studying AP hand jobs,

12:45.338 --> 12:47.505
I was kicking ass and busting curves.

12:47.588 --> 12:50.213
And I'm gonna continue to do that
at Yale next year.

12:50.297 --> 12:51.297
So...

12:52.088 --> 12:53.088
I like my choices,

12:53.130 --> 12:55.755
and wherever you three are next year,
I hope you do, too.

12:56.963 --> 12:58.088
I'm going to Yale, too.

13:01.172 --> 13:02.172
What?

13:02.213 --> 13:06.380
I'm incredible at hand jobs,
but I also got a 1560 on the SATs.

13:07.588 --> 13:08.672
No, you didn't.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.005
I got in early.

13:10.088 --> 13:11.463
- To Yale?
- Uh-huh.

13:11.547 --> 13:12.713
- Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

13:12.797 --> 13:13.630
Mm-hm.

13:13.713 --> 13:16.088
Oh, um, Tanner,
where are you going to school?

13:16.672 --> 13:19.005
Uh, I'm... I'm playing soccer at Stanford.

13:19.088 --> 13:22.213
Stanford University?
What are you guys talking about? That's...

13:22.297 --> 13:25.005
- No, yes, Stanford.
- Mm-hm. Stanford University.

13:25.088 --> 13:27.130
Hey, I'm not going to college.

13:27.213 --> 13:29.297
I got recruited to go code for Google.

13:29.380 --> 13:31.130
I mean, it's not Apple,

13:31.213 --> 13:33.463
but the bennies are pretty tight, man,

13:33.547 --> 13:35.588
and it's mid six-figures,
so I'm not complainin'.

13:35.672 --> 13:37.392
- That's my boy.
- So proud of you. Amazing.

13:37.422 --> 13:39.713
You failed the seventh grade twice.

13:40.047 --> 13:41.047
Rule of threes.

13:43.672 --> 13:45.352
- You guys are serious?
- Mm-hm.

13:46.088 --> 13:49.547
Hey, um, I'm gonna pretend
like I don't know you next year.

13:50.005 --> 13:51.005
No offense.

13:51.797 --> 13:52.713
Hmm.

13:52.797 --> 13:54.880
This... this isn't possible.

13:54.963 --> 13:56.713
You guys don't even care about school.

13:57.963 --> 13:58.963
No.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.338
We just don't only care about school.

14:10.172 --> 14:11.255
Well, I'm... I'm done.

14:11.338 --> 14:13.314
After... After you. After you, man.

14:13.338 --> 14:14.338
Okay.

14:15.297 --> 14:17.297
Sorry, excuse me.

14:19.547 --> 14:24.255
<i>You've worked harder
than everyone who's ever doubted you.</i>

14:24.338 --> 14:27.422
<i>You've worked harder.</i>

14:27.505 --> 14:28.547
<i>...doubted you.</i>

14:37.672 --> 14:38.672
Hey.

14:38.922 --> 14:40.380
You okay?

14:40.463 --> 14:42.547
Nick, where are you going
to school next year?

14:42.630 --> 14:45.047
- I thought we weren't supposed to talk...
- Just tell me!

14:45.130 --> 14:46.797
Georgetown. Jesus.

14:48.422 --> 14:51.231
- Hope, where are you going next year?
- No, I couldn't be less interested

14:51.255 --> 14:53.380
in, like, whatever this is.

14:53.463 --> 14:55.797
Gigi, where the fuck
are you going to school next year?

14:55.880 --> 14:57.838
Don't judge me, it was my fifth choice.

14:58.213 --> 14:59.213
Harvard.

15:20.463 --> 15:22.547
Seniors rule!

16:15.755 --> 16:16.915
This is fucked!

16:17.213 --> 16:18.213
Okay.

16:18.630 --> 16:20.255
This is obviously not helping.

16:20.338 --> 16:24.213
We chose. We didn't party
because we wanted to focus on school

16:24.297 --> 16:25.797
and get into good colleges.

16:25.880 --> 16:26.880
And it worked.

16:26.922 --> 16:29.088
But the irresponsible people who partied

16:29.172 --> 16:31.422
also got into those colleges,
they did both.

16:31.505 --> 16:32.338
So?

16:32.422 --> 16:33.713
So we messed up.

16:34.172 --> 16:35.922
We didn't have to choose. They did both.

16:36.005 --> 16:37.880
We are the only assholes who did one.

16:37.963 --> 16:40.880
Hey, we are not assholes, okay?

16:40.963 --> 16:41.838
Let's just...

16:41.922 --> 16:44.047
Come sit down, we'll cut the cake,

16:44.130 --> 16:45.297
look at the memory box,

16:45.380 --> 16:48.672
- celebrate the end...
- This is not a time to celebrate.

16:49.380 --> 16:50.838
We have to go to a party tonight.

16:51.547 --> 16:53.380
- What?
- Let's go to Nick's party.

16:53.463 --> 16:55.172
No... Are you kidding? No. No way.

16:55.255 --> 16:57.797
Amy, we only have one night left

16:57.880 --> 16:59.713
to have studied and partied
in high school.

16:59.797 --> 17:02.588
Otherwise, we're just gonna be the girls
that missed out.

17:02.672 --> 17:03.713
We haven't done anything.

17:03.797 --> 17:05.380
We haven't broken any rules.

17:05.463 --> 17:08.255
Okay, we've broken a lot of rules.

17:08.338 --> 17:09.922
One, we have fake IDs.

17:10.005 --> 17:12.963
Fake college IDs,
so we can get into their 24-hour library.

17:13.047 --> 17:15.880
Name one person whose life
was so much better

17:15.963 --> 17:17.923
- because they broke a couple of rules.
- Picasso.

17:17.963 --> 17:20.422
Yes, he broke art rules.
Name a person who broke a real one.

17:20.505 --> 17:21.713
- Rosa Parks.
- Name another.

17:21.797 --> 17:23.547
- Susan B. Anthony.
- Goddamn it.

17:23.630 --> 17:26.630
Amy, I'm so serious.
They think that we're robots.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.047
They think all we care about is taking
a million APs, and getting into Yale,

17:30.130 --> 17:31.963
and editing <i>Law Review</i> at Georgetown,

17:32.047 --> 17:34.527
and clerking for a federal judge
between junior and senior year

17:34.588 --> 17:37.505
before eventually becoming
the youngest justice

17:37.588 --> 17:41.463
ever nominated
to the Supreme Court of the United States.

17:44.463 --> 17:45.463
In my case.

17:46.338 --> 17:47.338
You get the point.

17:47.755 --> 17:50.547
- Nobody knows that we are fun.
- We know.

17:50.630 --> 17:51.505
They need to know.

17:51.588 --> 17:52.422
Who's they?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.422
We are not one-dimensional.

17:54.505 --> 17:56.505
We are smart and fun.

17:57.547 --> 17:58.880
We have to do this.

17:58.963 --> 18:00.005
This is crazy.

18:00.088 --> 18:02.380
We graduate tomorrow.

18:02.463 --> 18:03.922
What if we get in trouble?

18:04.005 --> 18:06.005
You know that we are too smart for that.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.963
Plus, Ryan is gonna be there.

18:08.047 --> 18:11.505
She wanted you to come.
You're finally gonna make your moves.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.255
No, she's not...

18:13.338 --> 18:15.731
You've been out for two years
and you've never kissed a girl.

18:15.755 --> 18:17.547
I want you to experience this.

18:18.005 --> 18:20.547
What will I be doing during that time,
you might ask?

18:20.630 --> 18:23.755
I'm going to experience
a seminal fun anecdote,

18:24.422 --> 18:26.922
and we are gonna change
our stories forever.

18:30.505 --> 18:32.145
We were gonna watch that Ken Burns thing.

18:32.172 --> 18:33.880
<i>The Dust Bowl </i> can wait, bitch!

18:34.255 --> 18:36.880
What took them four years,
we are doing in one night!

18:38.047 --> 18:39.255
Oh, Jesus!

18:49.755 --> 18:50.963
- No!
- No!

18:51.047 --> 18:52.338
- No. Not acceptable.
- Not okay.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.902
Who allowed you to be this beautiful?

18:53.963 --> 18:58.172
- Who allowed you to be this beautiful?
- Who allowed you to take my breath away?

18:58.255 --> 19:00.231
- Call the paramedics, call the police.
- Who... No.

19:00.255 --> 19:02.815
- 'Cause there has been an emergency.
- I can't look right at it.

19:04.255 --> 19:05.255
Not today!

19:06.255 --> 19:07.547
Grip escape move!

19:09.297 --> 19:11.047
Oh. Work.

19:11.130 --> 19:12.505
Get it? Tushy?

19:12.588 --> 19:13.672
Hand sanitizer.

19:13.755 --> 19:14.755
ChapStick.

19:14.838 --> 19:15.963
College IDs.

19:16.047 --> 19:19.172
Now, mace. Listen, it is very important
that you keep the safety...

19:19.255 --> 19:20.422
Oh!

19:20.505 --> 19:22.047
- Ah! Amy!
- The safety's not on!

19:22.130 --> 19:23.588
Don't touch your eyes!

19:23.672 --> 19:25.630
You have the same parts she does.

19:25.713 --> 19:28.463
You just take what you do to yourself,
flip it upside down.

19:28.547 --> 19:30.338
Well, I don't... I don't really...

19:30.422 --> 19:32.630
Just a down, but a flip.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.130
- I don't...
- A down flip.

19:34.213 --> 19:36.547
Well... what if I don't use my hands?

19:36.630 --> 19:39.255
You can make yourself come
using only your mind?

19:39.338 --> 19:41.255
- No.
- That's the one thing my mind can't do.

19:41.338 --> 19:44.797
No! Well, I use just... other stuff.

19:45.963 --> 19:47.172
- A book?
- No.

19:47.255 --> 19:49.338
Very Freudian,
but I'd worry about paper cuts.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.505
No. Can we just stop talking about this?

19:51.588 --> 19:54.047
- That little elephant?
- No! Stop!

19:54.130 --> 19:55.672
That weird crochet pig?

19:55.755 --> 19:57.314
My grandma gave me that
before she died!

19:57.338 --> 19:59.058
If you don't tell me what it is,
you know...

19:59.088 --> 20:01.005
It's the panda! It's the panda, okay?

20:01.088 --> 20:03.255
The panda. Whatever. Just...

20:04.338 --> 20:05.838
Can we just stop talking about this?

20:05.922 --> 20:08.338
Please, for the love of all things.

20:08.672 --> 20:09.712
Quick question.

20:10.338 --> 20:11.672
Just a quick Q.

20:11.755 --> 20:13.213
What happened to her eye?

20:14.922 --> 20:17.255
That fell off way before
anything happened between us.

20:17.338 --> 20:19.505
- Does she talk dirty to you?
- Mm-mm.

20:20.172 --> 20:22.672
- Tell you about how she's endangered?
- No!

20:23.380 --> 20:25.380
- Stop!
- Do pandas roar?

20:25.463 --> 20:28.213
- Stop!
- You sneaky little bitch.

20:28.297 --> 20:30.130
I can't believe you didn't tell me

20:30.213 --> 20:32.755
that you have been mounting
that tragic panda

20:32.838 --> 20:34.463
every single night!

20:34.547 --> 20:36.398
- Yeah.
- This is... Honestly, it's exhilarating.

20:36.422 --> 20:38.255
I thought I knew everything about you.

20:38.338 --> 20:41.588
I think it's healthy for a relationship
to have secrets, and now we have one.

20:42.172 --> 20:44.255
Do I have a secret for you? Okay, yes.

20:44.338 --> 20:45.338
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

20:45.588 --> 20:47.880
- I once tried to masturbate...
- Mm.

20:48.213 --> 20:50.213
with an electric toothbrush.

20:51.005 --> 20:53.172
But I got a horrible UTI.

20:53.755 --> 20:54.672
Horrible.

20:54.755 --> 20:55.755
Like...

20:56.255 --> 20:57.255
horrible.

20:57.547 --> 21:01.963
I wish that would have been a secret,
but you've mentioned it many, many times.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.463
Hey. Hey!

21:06.005 --> 21:07.463
I need you to do the talking.

21:07.963 --> 21:10.172
Why don't you just tell them
we're going to a party?

21:10.380 --> 21:13.255
Because they'll ask too many questions.
They'll try to call Nick's aunt.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.838
I've never lied to my parents before.

21:15.922 --> 21:18.338
You know when I lie,
I just add too many details.

21:18.838 --> 21:22.630
Just make up a story, but don't say
we're having a date night or anything.

21:22.713 --> 21:24.963
Why? It's funny
your parents think we're boning.

21:25.047 --> 21:26.255
No, it's not,

21:26.338 --> 21:29.172
because you're not the one
who has to deal with their creepy smiles

21:29.255 --> 21:31.213
when I tell them
I'm meeting you at the library,

21:31.297 --> 21:33.630
when I'm actually
meeting you at the library.

21:33.713 --> 21:36.422
Honestly, it's surprising
that Doug and Charmaine are supportive,

21:36.505 --> 21:37.963
considering their whole Jesus thing.

21:38.047 --> 21:38.922
It's nice.

21:39.005 --> 21:40.672
- Charmaine, get to the safe room.
- Hey!

21:40.755 --> 21:42.356
- We're bein' robbed by supermodels.
- Hi!

21:42.380 --> 21:44.713
Aw, you girls look fabulous.

21:44.797 --> 21:46.797
- Oh...
- And smart, and also brave.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.088
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks.

21:48.172 --> 21:49.212
- Aww!
- Are you guys cold?

21:49.255 --> 21:50.297
- Oh, no.
- A little nippy.

21:50.380 --> 21:52.547
I'll start a fire,
or I'll turn up the heat.

21:52.630 --> 21:54.755
Just get the jackets off.
Dinner's about ready.

21:54.838 --> 21:56.356
- Oh, you've gotta taste this.
- Well...

21:56.380 --> 21:58.713
- Yeah.
- I'm calling it "diplo-meatball."

21:59.963 --> 22:01.043
- Sure.
- Don't engage them.

22:01.088 --> 22:02.672
Oh, right, right, okay. Um...

22:02.755 --> 22:04.255
Char-Char, Dougsicles,

22:04.797 --> 22:08.297
would it be okay
if Amy stayed over at my house tonight?

22:11.255 --> 22:14.338
- The... the night before graduation?
- Yeah.

22:14.422 --> 22:16.922
You know, my mom can drive us
to the ceremony.

22:17.005 --> 22:20.880
We just want as much time together
as we can before she leaves for Africa.

22:21.338 --> 22:22.338
We made, uh...

22:23.255 --> 22:24.380
mushroom cap and gowns.

22:24.463 --> 22:27.255
- Yeah...
- We made special names for all this stuff.

22:27.338 --> 22:29.838
- Great deal of care was taken.
- Well...

22:29.922 --> 22:31.588
Every... I mean, look, uh...

22:32.047 --> 22:33.922
Chips and sal-so long, high school.

22:34.005 --> 22:35.685
You know, cheese and...

22:35.755 --> 22:39.797
sala-me being your dad
was the greatest honor of my life.

22:40.255 --> 22:41.838
You know, e-everything has a name.

22:41.922 --> 22:44.505
- O-love my baby girl. That's olives.
- Yeah.

22:44.588 --> 22:46.523
- Doug.
- Do you know what? We get it.

22:46.547 --> 22:47.880
- But...
- We get it.

22:48.505 --> 22:50.023
- Yes, yes, yes.
- We understand, okay?

22:50.047 --> 22:51.880
- What you two have...
- We do. I'm sorry.

22:51.963 --> 22:55.463
- What they have is very, very special.
- I'm sorry.

22:55.547 --> 22:56.713
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

22:56.797 --> 22:58.505
Oh! It really is.

22:58.880 --> 23:02.005
It is. You know, they say
you never forget your first...

23:02.088 --> 23:03.088
Friend.

23:03.630 --> 23:05.922
- Special friend.
- Normal friend.

23:06.005 --> 23:08.422
- Yeah, my special friend.
- Mm. Yeah.

23:08.505 --> 23:11.255
I'm just so thankful
we get to spend the whole night together

23:11.338 --> 23:13.463
to really show each other

23:13.547 --> 23:16.047
- how much we care about each other.
- Ah. Oh!

23:16.130 --> 23:17.755
- That's great.
- Mmm, my girl.

23:17.838 --> 23:20.172
We'll probably just do
a Korean face mask.

23:20.255 --> 23:22.047
Well, I don't need to know all the words.

23:23.088 --> 23:24.547
- Okay.
- Go, go, go!

23:30.005 --> 23:31.547
Whoo-hoo! That's it!

23:31.630 --> 23:32.672
Oh, my God!

23:32.755 --> 23:35.088
<i>Nick's auntie's house
is about to be popping.</i>

23:35.172 --> 23:37.064
<i>- Big ass party.
- Aunt Viv. Aunt Viv, I love you.</i>

23:37.088 --> 23:39.172
<i>Ten-four. That's for the boy.</i>

23:39.755 --> 23:41.005

23:46.255 --> 23:48.172
<i>- Oh, fuck!</i>
- God.

23:48.547 --> 23:50.107
- Tanner ate a ghost pepper.
<i>- Oh, my...</i>

23:50.422 --> 23:52.380
He needs milk. Someone get him milk.

23:52.463 --> 23:55.088
- That's... that's not gonna help.
<i>- Oh, fuck!</i>

23:55.172 --> 23:57.172
<i>- Oh, my...
- Oh!</i>

23:57.255 --> 24:00.005
Oh, that's too much milk.
He.. he just had too much milk.

24:00.255 --> 24:03.255
Fuck! No one is answering.

24:03.505 --> 24:06.380
Somebody give me the address!

24:06.463 --> 24:09.130
We've never hung out
with any of these people

24:09.213 --> 24:11.005
outside of academic activities.

24:11.088 --> 24:13.755
They probably think we're calling
about school stuff.

24:14.338 --> 24:15.172
You're right.

24:15.255 --> 24:16.505
Can we just call a Lyft?

24:16.797 --> 24:18.713
We still don't know where we're going.

24:19.380 --> 24:22.422
Do you know a Lyft driver
that knows where Nick's aunt lives?

24:23.547 --> 24:24.547
I think I do.

24:27.088 --> 24:28.088
Who are you calling?

24:28.880 --> 24:30.005
Don't worry about it, <i>chica.</i>

24:30.588 --> 24:31.588
What?

24:38.880 --> 24:39.880
Jesus Christ.

24:39.922 --> 24:41.630
All aboard the SS Lit!

24:43.297 --> 24:44.297
As fuck!

24:45.297 --> 24:46.713
The SS Lit As Fuck.

24:47.213 --> 24:48.963
- No.
- I'm so glad you called.

24:49.047 --> 24:51.588
Sorry it took so long. Traffic was nerts.

24:52.255 --> 24:53.255
I'll co... I'll come...

24:53.338 --> 24:55.755
It's like Guy Fieri's wet dream.

24:55.838 --> 24:57.255
It's a means to an end.

24:59.047 --> 25:01.047
May I offer you the front,
mademoiselle?

25:01.130 --> 25:03.255
No? Goin' for the back? That's cool.

25:03.338 --> 25:05.738
Back's great too. Great air flow
back there. Get on in there.

25:05.797 --> 25:08.297
Okay. Time for some nights
we'll never remember

25:08.380 --> 25:10.088
with friends we'll never forget, huh?

25:10.172 --> 25:11.852
Jared, you know where the party is, right?

25:11.880 --> 25:13.005
Absofruitly, ladies.

25:13.088 --> 25:16.297
We are headed to the biggest, coolest
grad night party in town.

25:16.380 --> 25:17.797
Can I get a what-what?

25:18.297 --> 25:19.338
Jesus Christ.

25:19.422 --> 25:22.505
No? That's okay. Maybe later.
It's over on the west side, so...

25:22.963 --> 25:24.088
Get some tunes goin'.

25:24.172 --> 25:27.880
<i>Random House Audio

25:27.963 --> 25:29.172
<i>- and the Will to Lead.</i>
<i>- </i> Okay.

25:29.463 --> 25:31.814
<i>- By Sheryl Sandberg with Nell Scovell.</i>
- That's embarrassing.

25:31.838 --> 25:35.047
I have this thing where I like to hear
the words of powerful women before I party

25:35.130 --> 25:38.005
to remind myself of the respect and awe
you ladies deserve.

25:38.088 --> 25:40.172
<i>Internalizing the revolution.</i>

25:40.463 --> 25:42.463
<i>I got pregnant with my first child

25:42.547 --> 25:45.467
I'll get somethin' peppy going.
We'll get this party started, huh?

25:56.297 --> 25:57.547
Sorry about that.

25:57.630 --> 25:59.856
Jared, it's fine.
Isn't she your girlfriend or something?

25:59.880 --> 26:01.422
What? No, she's...

26:02.547 --> 26:05.005
No girlfriend for me. I can't pick faves.

26:05.088 --> 26:08.130
Too many ladies wanna lock this down,
and they don't have the code.

26:08.213 --> 26:09.255
Two-eight-three-one.

26:09.463 --> 26:11.547
Well, that's my PIN number.

26:11.630 --> 26:12.505
Uh... but...

26:12.588 --> 26:14.963
Sorry, I'll just... What's up, Gig?

<i>I left my tin of special things
in your car and I need it!</i>

26:19.547 --> 26:21.213
Okay, all right. Jeez, Louise!

26:21.797 --> 26:25.255
Do I wanna know
what a tin of special things is?

26:28.547 --> 26:30.463
Oh, my God. This is drugs.

26:31.005 --> 26:32.297
- What?
- What?

26:32.380 --> 26:36.130
Hey, Jare.
Jared, we're just gonna hop out here.

26:36.213 --> 26:37.588
- Wait, what? Why?
- No.

26:37.672 --> 26:39.630
- She's kidding.
- No, I'm not.

26:39.713 --> 26:41.422
Our... Our friend, she just texted us.

26:41.505 --> 26:44.047
And she said she... she...
she hit a possum with her car.

26:44.130 --> 26:46.505
- No! You know what kind of possum?
- Yeah. It's bad.

26:46.588 --> 26:49.713
But the possum didn't die.
Its adrenaline and... and rage

26:49.797 --> 26:52.731
- just made it start chasing her...
- We are not hopping off. Keep driving.

26:52.755 --> 26:55.814
What about the po... Is she gonna be okay?
Wanna text her and see if she's okay?

26:55.838 --> 26:58.038
Enough about the possum!
Jared, you took Spanish, right?

26:58.088 --> 26:59.713
<i>Ah, sí, sí, mi bonita mujer.</i>

27:08.797 --> 27:09.837
I'm not gettin' any of it.

27:18.380 --> 27:19.380
Whoo!

27:19.505 --> 27:21.713
Came in a little hot there. That's my bad.

27:21.797 --> 27:24.213
- But we are here.
- What do we do? What do we do?

27:24.297 --> 27:26.713
- Don't move, don't inhale.
- All right.

27:28.130 --> 27:29.172
Oh, shit.

27:29.255 --> 27:31.672
There are drugs in my orifices.

27:31.755 --> 27:32.588
Drugs.

27:32.672 --> 27:33.672
Oh, no, that's...

27:33.880 --> 27:35.713
It's not drugs.
That's just Gigi's vitamins.

27:37.088 --> 27:37.922
Her... her what?

27:38.005 --> 27:41.463
Yeah, you know, like vitamin D, B-12. Gigi
likes to crush them up and snort them.

27:41.547 --> 27:44.308
She says they work better that way.
We'll get you cleaned up on board.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.963
What? What do you mean, "on board"?

27:47.380 --> 27:50.297
Okay, now, you guys said
you wanted to go to the best party.

27:50.380 --> 27:53.338
So... I brought you to the best party.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.505
Which is my party!

27:55.088 --> 27:56.713
Prepare to get bashed!

27:58.297 --> 27:59.797
Not... Not in, like, a violent way.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.463
Completely consensual bashing.
I don't know if that was clear.

28:02.547 --> 28:04.067
"Prepared to get consensually bashed."

28:04.130 --> 28:05.838
I'll have 'em change it.
What do you think?

28:05.922 --> 28:07.797
You're serious, Jared? This is your party?

28:07.880 --> 28:10.505
You don't wanna go
to Nick's lame house party. You don't.

28:10.588 --> 28:12.213
A boat is international waters, right?

28:12.297 --> 28:14.880
Maritime law.
Just come check it out for a little bit.

28:14.963 --> 28:16.005
It's sick.

28:16.088 --> 28:18.922
The catering company said it's
the coolest party they've ever been to.

28:19.005 --> 28:20.422
And I'll tell you somethin'.

28:21.255 --> 28:23.172
They worked Sasha Obama's sweet 16.

28:24.630 --> 28:26.630
- Up to you.
- What are we thinking?

28:27.213 --> 28:29.213
- We still don't have Nick's address.
- Mm.

28:29.547 --> 28:31.797
Someone on board might know where it is.

28:32.380 --> 28:35.130
And I'd like to meet someone
who met Sasha.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.672
Yeah, respect for Sasha. Okay.

28:37.755 --> 28:38.755
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

28:38.838 --> 28:39.838
Let's go.

28:40.297 --> 28:41.297
You guys excited?

28:45.380 --> 28:46.422
Welcome to the club!

28:46.505 --> 28:47.755
Oh, no.

28:47.838 --> 28:49.880
Cool, huh? We're on a boat.
What's up with that?

28:50.172 --> 28:51.588
There is not a soul here, Ames.

28:51.672 --> 28:52.547
Ice tiger.

28:52.630 --> 28:54.505
This is insane. You made gift bags?

28:55.297 --> 28:57.047
There is an iPad in here.

28:57.130 --> 29:00.713
Preloaded with photos of all of our best
high school memories, class of 2019.

29:00.797 --> 29:02.172
Say what? Champagne?

29:02.255 --> 29:04.505
There's a masseuse in the back,
male or female.

29:04.588 --> 29:06.630
Gambling behind the bar. Do you guys tan?

29:08.005 --> 29:09.797
I'm so happy you guys are here.

29:11.130 --> 29:13.505
- I knew you guys partied. Didn't I?
- You did, she said it.

29:13.588 --> 29:15.255
I told him. "Those guys seem quiet,

29:15.338 --> 29:18.058
but they're probably spending
every weekend at, like, a sex dungeon."

29:18.130 --> 29:20.755
- No.
- Here, try one of these strawberries.

29:20.838 --> 29:21.838
Okay.

29:22.130 --> 29:23.047
No.

29:23.130 --> 29:24.963
- No, no, no...
- Mmm...

29:25.047 --> 29:27.047
Mmm...

29:27.797 --> 29:29.797
- Ah.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

29:30.922 --> 29:32.505
- Not bad.
- That's pretty good.

29:32.588 --> 29:33.588
Wait.

29:37.588 --> 29:40.838
Mmm...

29:40.922 --> 29:42.755
Oh, God, you taste like my vitamins.

29:42.838 --> 29:44.797
- Uh...
<i>- </i> I think I'm in love with you.

29:44.880 --> 29:45.922
I don't think you are.

29:46.005 --> 29:47.672
- You're coming with me.
- What?

29:47.755 --> 29:49.963
Dance party upstairs!

29:50.047 --> 29:51.630
Yeah! Whoo!

29:51.713 --> 29:53.130
<i>- </i> No, wait!
<i>- </i> Yes, yes, yes!

29:53.213 --> 29:55.463
Amy? Amy? Amy? Ame, we're not...

29:55.547 --> 29:58.005
Look what I found... with your name on it.

29:58.088 --> 29:59.213
Come on, too cool.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.047
How do you feel, huh? You look stoked.

30:01.130 --> 30:02.755
- Chicken spring roll?
- No, thank you.

30:03.922 --> 30:05.005
Oh, you, uh...

30:05.630 --> 30:06.713
Oh!

30:06.797 --> 30:07.797
You want?

30:08.172 --> 30:09.588
Oh, no thank you.

30:09.672 --> 30:11.088
Not a drug person.

30:11.172 --> 30:13.922
Not even pot?
I feel like it could help you relax.

30:14.088 --> 30:16.463
<i>- </i> Nope. Doesn't work for me.
<i>- </i> Huh.

30:16.547 --> 30:18.547
DJ Rod!

30:18.630 --> 30:20.797
What the fuck?

30:22.588 --> 30:24.463
Jared... stop.

30:25.047 --> 30:26.963
Jared, wrap...

30:27.047 --> 30:29.588
Take the helmet off! Take the helmet off!

30:32.880 --> 30:35.630
This isn't working.
You can't buy people's affection.

30:36.797 --> 30:38.130
Um...

30:40.380 --> 30:43.547
No, I'm pretty sure you can.

30:43.630 --> 30:46.713
'Cause I've seen it a lot.
My parents did it.

30:47.630 --> 30:49.870
- Their parents did it.
- Just stop trying so hard, okay?

30:49.922 --> 30:51.380
People sense it, it turns them off.

30:51.463 --> 30:52.547
But you try hard.

30:53.755 --> 30:56.036
You try hard and everything.
That's what I like about you.

30:58.172 --> 31:00.088
- I didn't mean it like...
- I'm just gonna...

31:00.172 --> 31:01.880
- I meant more like...
- I'm gonna go.

31:01.963 --> 31:04.172
- Lamb meatball?
- Motherfucker! You're everywhere!

31:04.255 --> 31:08.088
One time I ate a legal pot brownie
when Model UN went to Amsterdam.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.000
And as soon as I got high,
I just cried about the fact

31:11.047 --> 31:13.130
that one day my mom will die, so...

31:13.213 --> 31:15.172
- I had the exact same thing.
- Really?

31:15.255 --> 31:17.922
I lost my virginity
in what I thought was a park, but...

31:18.005 --> 31:21.255
it turned out to be a graveyard, and now
the ghost spirits live inside my eggs

31:21.338 --> 31:22.630
waiting to be reborn.

31:22.713 --> 31:23.797
That's not at all the same.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.338
I always felt like we were similar.

31:25.422 --> 31:26.648
- God, I'm gonna miss you.
- Oof.

31:26.672 --> 31:28.005
Hey. You can't smoke up here.

31:28.088 --> 31:29.380
- Oh...
- What'd you say to her?

31:29.463 --> 31:31.547
- I said it to you, you can't smoke.
- Um...

31:31.630 --> 31:33.838
You do not speak to her that way.

31:33.922 --> 31:35.755
Is... Is the her me? 'Cause I'm fine.

31:35.838 --> 31:38.088
That is my best friend
in the fucking world!

31:38.172 --> 31:41.130
- We're not, she's not...
- We'll fucking fight you to the death!

31:41.213 --> 31:42.338
Oh!

31:42.422 --> 31:43.755
Okay, I'm calling security.

31:43.838 --> 31:47.130
- Amy, we need to get the fuck outta here...
- Oh, my God!

31:47.213 --> 31:49.797
- Light 'em up, Luanne! It's go time!
- Um...

31:50.422 --> 31:53.047
There's only one thing left to do. Jump.

31:53.130 --> 31:55.088
- No! Off the boat?
- Wait, what? No! No!

31:55.172 --> 31:56.212
- No, seriously...
- You...

31:56.672 --> 31:59.213
- What are you guys doin' up here?
- Swan dive into the future!

31:59.297 --> 32:00.547
Grip escape move!

32:00.630 --> 32:02.255
No, no, no!

32:02.338 --> 32:04.505
Gege? Gege?

32:04.588 --> 32:05.963
- Ooh!
- Holy fuck!

32:06.047 --> 32:07.255
Gege, are you okay?

32:07.338 --> 32:09.630
- She's okay. Bail, bail, bail, bail!
- Just bail.

32:14.047 --> 32:15.047
Jesus!

32:16.463 --> 32:17.672
Oh, my God!

32:17.755 --> 32:19.797
I am so sweaty!

32:19.880 --> 32:21.672
Oh, my God!

32:21.963 --> 32:24.163
We need to figure something out
before we get to Nick's.

32:24.713 --> 32:26.672
- You still want to go to Nick's?
- You don't?

32:27.130 --> 32:29.088
Well, dude, we went to a party.

32:29.547 --> 32:30.838
We did it. Let's go home.

32:34.505 --> 32:36.463
- Amy...
- Don't do your lecture voice.

32:36.547 --> 32:38.338
That was not a party.

32:38.422 --> 32:40.255
Well, it definitely was a party.

32:40.338 --> 32:41.922
That was a detour.

32:42.005 --> 32:44.588
We are A-plus people,

32:44.672 --> 32:46.755
and we are going to an A-plus party.

32:46.838 --> 32:47.838
Like this.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.380
Oh, my God, Alan responded.

32:54.463 --> 32:56.713
We have the address!
Okay, I'm calling a Lyft.

32:57.047 --> 32:58.463
Oh, my score is...

32:58.880 --> 32:59.797
My score is very low.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.064
I'm much too abrasive with the drivers.
You should call.

33:02.088 --> 33:03.088
I'm gonna go home.

33:03.213 --> 33:06.547
But if you wanna go to Nick's,
you should really go. Seriously, go.

33:08.255 --> 33:09.255
Malala.

33:12.797 --> 33:13.797
Whoa.

33:14.213 --> 33:16.338
- I'm calling Malala.
- Wow.

33:16.422 --> 33:19.630
You know you only get,
like, one Malala a year?

33:19.713 --> 33:20.922
Yeah, I'm calling it.

33:21.422 --> 33:24.505
Full support, no questions asked,
you are coming with me.

33:24.588 --> 33:25.588
Hmm.

33:28.672 --> 33:29.672
Malala.

33:30.505 --> 33:31.505
All right.

33:32.672 --> 33:33.672
Malala.

33:36.088 --> 33:37.172
Oh!

33:37.255 --> 33:38.547
Oh!

33:39.422 --> 33:42.130
Um... okay. Jordan?

33:42.213 --> 33:43.755
Yeah, and you're Am...

33:46.797 --> 33:48.422
Shit.

33:56.255 --> 33:57.255
You know, I-I, um...

33:57.338 --> 34:00.588
this job's a good way to supplement
the, uh... the old income.

34:01.130 --> 34:03.255
You know, teachers' salaries today
and all, so...

34:03.338 --> 34:05.380
- It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's a disgrace.

34:05.463 --> 34:07.630
Meet new people
and see new parts of the city,

34:07.713 --> 34:08.922
and run into old friends.

34:10.172 --> 34:12.588
- Friends?
- Plus, I'm writin' a book now.

34:12.672 --> 34:13.505
Oh.

34:13.588 --> 34:15.398
- Yeah, yeah. I'm not just a principal.
- Cool.

34:15.422 --> 34:19.672
Nothing more exciting or daunting
than the blank page, you know?

34:19.755 --> 34:21.880
One book I'm thinkin' about doin'
is a book of quotes.

34:21.963 --> 34:25.588
Nothing more daunting or exciting
than the blank page.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.922
But, yeah, that's one idea. I'm thinkin'
about doin' a detective novel.

34:29.005 --> 34:30.963
Actually, you know what?
You two will love...

34:31.213 --> 34:34.213
Amy, you'll love this.
It's a, uh... a female detective.

34:34.297 --> 34:35.630
- Oh, really?
- A lady detective.

34:35.713 --> 34:37.193
- Yeah, how about that?
- Interesting.

34:37.422 --> 34:40.005
Yeah, she's, uh... And she's pregnant too.
Still workin'.

34:40.088 --> 34:43.338
And, uh, you know, the baby,
whenever she's, like, close to a clue,

34:43.422 --> 34:46.463
or, like, one of her hunches is,
like, uh, you know, close,

34:46.547 --> 34:47.588
the baby kicks,

34:47.880 --> 34:50.088
you know, and the harder it kicks,
the closer she is.

34:50.172 --> 34:51.838
And, uh, that's where I'm at right now.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.797
I... I... I don't know what to do
once, um...

34:54.213 --> 34:55.838
you know, when she, um, gives birth.

34:55.922 --> 34:57.130
- But, um...
- Hmm.

34:57.213 --> 34:59.922
Hey, you dumb son of a bitch!

35:00.297 --> 35:01.422
Choose a lane!

35:02.338 --> 35:03.172
That was nuts.

35:03.255 --> 35:05.189
Don't know what that was.

35:05.213 --> 35:06.213
Oh, this town.

35:06.755 --> 35:09.005
Ah, the angry people in this town...

35:11.588 --> 35:12.588
Yeah.

35:18.422 --> 35:19.297
Want some music maybe?

35:19.380 --> 35:20.713
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:20.797 --> 35:21.797
Genius.

35:25.505 --> 35:27.755
Dude, we're gonna get to Nick's so late.

35:27.838 --> 35:29.963
It's fine.
Everybody shows up to parties late.

35:30.047 --> 35:32.088
It's like, it's cooler to be late.

35:32.172 --> 35:33.880
We're gonna arrive right at the crest.

35:33.963 --> 35:35.880
Before you know it,
you'll be neck deep in Ryan.

35:36.172 --> 35:38.297
Neck deep in what direction?

35:38.380 --> 35:41.838
- You tell me.
- I don't know. I don't know anything.

35:41.922 --> 35:44.838
This is like your nightmare about
having to land a commercial airliner,

35:44.922 --> 35:46.713
but much, much worse.

35:47.922 --> 35:50.713
I mean, is it? Is it worse?

35:50.797 --> 35:51.880
Well, yeah.

35:51.963 --> 35:53.603
I had the lives of 100 people
in my hands.

35:53.630 --> 35:55.672
My crew was counting on me.
I was their Sully.

35:55.755 --> 35:58.588
- I'm really stressed about it.
- I-m... Okay, I know you are.

35:58.672 --> 36:00.088
If only there was just...

36:01.130 --> 36:03.130
a video of people hookin' up.

36:05.088 --> 36:06.963
Sorry, are you talking about porn?

36:07.047 --> 36:08.130
- All I'm saying...
- No.

36:08.213 --> 36:11.755
No one would know
if you watched one porn one time.

36:12.422 --> 36:13.755
Think of it as a documentary.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.422
Just a sexy documentary. It's a hot doc.

36:16.505 --> 36:19.172
All of those women
are European trafficking victims.

36:19.255 --> 36:21.898
Excuse me, ma'am, are you judging
other people's sexual preferences?

36:21.922 --> 36:24.922
- 'Cause you fuck a panda every night.
- "Fuck a panda..." So fucking funny!

36:25.005 --> 36:28.422
Are you about to say you're gonna judge me
for dabbling in pornography?

36:28.505 --> 36:31.547
- Thought you were a sex-positive feminist.
- Are you insane?

36:32.088 --> 36:34.338
Principal Brown is right there.

36:34.422 --> 36:36.588
- I have headphones.
- He's four feet away from us.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.547
I have headphones, madam.

36:39.963 --> 36:43.005
All right, but once we get a sense
of the mechanics,

36:43.088 --> 36:46.588
- I am shutting it off real quick.
- Of course.

36:48.338 --> 36:49.797
It's for educational purposes.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.588
Educational purposes.

37:00.755 --> 37:02.463
Plug in. Your phone's gonna die.

37:02.922 --> 37:04.322
Um...

37:07.630 --> 37:09.088
- Principal Brown?
- Oh.

37:09.172 --> 37:10.547
Principal Brown was my dad.

37:11.005 --> 37:12.148
- Uh...
- Just call me Jordan.

37:12.172 --> 37:13.047
Uh...

37:13.130 --> 37:14.630
No, thank you. Principal Brown?

37:14.713 --> 37:15.713
- Yes.
- I'm so...

37:15.755 --> 37:17.338
Uh, do you have a phone charger?

37:17.422 --> 37:18.963
- No, I don't.
- Oh.

37:19.047 --> 37:20.088
Got like 13.

37:20.172 --> 37:22.088
Yeah, here. Here you go. Catch.

37:24.547 --> 37:26.422
Didn't know you could do that
from that angle.

37:27.963 --> 37:29.505
Oh, wait, what did I miss?

37:29.880 --> 37:31.439
- Go back, actually.
- Yeah, scroll back.

37:31.463 --> 37:33.588
- The part... Wait, start right there.
- Oh, there.

37:34.797 --> 37:37.637
If you guys want to listen to your music,
I can just plug it in up here.

37:37.672 --> 37:39.672
- No! No! No!
- No! No!

37:39.755 --> 37:41.213
No, fuck!

37:41.297 --> 37:43.963
<i>That's fuckin' hot.</i>

37:44.047 --> 37:45.922
<i>Yes!</i>

37:47.630 --> 37:49.505
Come on! Come on!

37:57.838 --> 37:58.838
Don't touch me.

38:01.547 --> 38:02.797
Was that Cardi B?

38:06.672 --> 38:09.130
- You... Oh, my God! You are the...
- I cannot believe it!

38:09.213 --> 38:11.130
- You are the devil!
- I'm gonna die!

38:11.213 --> 38:13.338
I'm literally gonna physically die!

38:13.422 --> 38:15.213
Oh, Jesus Christ.

38:17.713 --> 38:18.713
Come in.

38:20.005 --> 38:21.713
He's dead!

38:21.797 --> 38:23.172
What the fuck?

38:23.255 --> 38:24.547
He's dead!

38:25.130 --> 38:26.963
- Wh... Who's dead?
- My husband.

38:28.047 --> 38:29.338
He's been killed!

38:29.422 --> 38:32.047
Okay, Alan, you don't have
to do your entrance

38:32.130 --> 38:34.838
every time somebody arrives, okay?

38:36.672 --> 38:38.880
- What are you guys doing here?
- What is going on?

38:38.963 --> 38:41.172
It's a murder mystery party.

38:41.963 --> 38:44.963
- I've been planning it for months.
- Wait, this is your house? Alan?

38:45.297 --> 38:49.005
Alan, I was so clear in my text
we are looking for Nick's party.

38:49.088 --> 38:51.880
My husband, Robert,
was an esteemed Broadway director

38:51.963 --> 38:53.755
and the love of my life.

38:54.130 --> 38:55.672
And he's been killed.

38:56.213 --> 38:57.963
Like a dog in the street.

38:58.047 --> 39:00.713
- Was he stabbed?
- That sounds very tragic.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.630
But there's been a mistake.
We're looking for Nick's party.

39:03.713 --> 39:05.838
Do you have the address? We can't find it.

39:05.922 --> 39:07.422
I don't know a Nick.

39:08.172 --> 39:09.713
I only know sorrow...

39:10.588 --> 39:11.713
and grief.

39:11.797 --> 39:12.922
Okay, you're at a ten.

39:13.005 --> 39:14.463
I need you at a two.

39:17.088 --> 39:19.255
I have a wake to plan.

39:19.338 --> 39:21.463
Okay, well, if you guys are here,

39:21.547 --> 39:23.547
you might as well take
some of the extra characters

39:23.588 --> 39:25.922
- since two people decided not to show up.
- No...

39:26.172 --> 39:27.172
Okay.

39:29.463 --> 39:31.898
- Adorable farmer new to the city.
- We don't need characters.

39:31.922 --> 39:35.463
- We're not staying.
- Hideous barren orthodontist.

39:35.547 --> 39:36.672
Why am I barren?

39:36.755 --> 39:38.963
Am I here to farm
or have I given up that life?

39:39.047 --> 39:40.422
This just says "orthodontist."

39:40.505 --> 39:42.838
- Your backstories are in the packets.
- No, no.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.297
We are not staying.
We're going to Nick's party.

39:45.380 --> 39:46.672
- We can just stay for...
- No.

39:46.755 --> 39:49.213
- The one where someone ate a ghost pepper?
- Yes.

39:49.297 --> 39:52.380
Yeah, somebody here came from there,
I think. Maybe the mayor.

39:53.297 --> 39:55.588
Go! Immerse yourselves.

39:55.672 --> 39:58.463
Review your histories in the parlor.

39:58.963 --> 40:01.398
Okay, if your characters aren't married,
hands off each other.

40:01.422 --> 40:02.422
No!

40:03.963 --> 40:04.880
Oh.

40:04.963 --> 40:06.672
Do not go gently.

40:06.755 --> 40:07.755
Oh, she's really good.

40:08.463 --> 40:09.672
Oh, my God! You guys are here.

40:09.755 --> 40:11.189
- How'd you get here?
- What the fuck?

40:11.213 --> 40:12.338
How did you get here?

40:12.422 --> 40:13.422
And how are you dry?

40:13.797 --> 40:15.213
How are you dry?

40:15.297 --> 40:16.963
Aaron, I can see you breathing.

40:17.422 --> 40:19.297
Gigi? Mm. Dig deeper.

40:19.380 --> 40:20.755
- I don't know what...
- I don't...

40:20.838 --> 40:21.672
- She was like...
- Oh!

40:21.755 --> 40:22.797
I can't think about it.

40:23.130 --> 40:24.672
Oh, is it over?

40:24.755 --> 40:28.463
No! Stop! Mom, do not talk to the actors!
The house is mine till 11 p.m.

40:28.755 --> 40:31.588
Cindy, I swear to fucking God!

40:33.463 --> 40:36.422
- Jesus Christ! God.
- Gigi! What the fuck?

40:36.505 --> 40:38.047
Guys, the re-election is coming up

40:38.130 --> 40:40.088
and I need to know
if I have to buy your votes.

40:40.172 --> 40:41.422
Wait, are you the mayor?

40:41.505 --> 40:42.922
Do you know where Nick's party is?

40:43.005 --> 40:44.925
Of course I do.
I know where all the parties are.

40:44.963 --> 40:45.797
Where is it?

40:45.880 --> 40:47.838
Come into my office, now.

40:47.922 --> 40:49.130
Okay, thank you.

40:49.630 --> 40:52.422
In, in, in. Go, go, go.
Come, come, come. Now, now, now!

40:54.213 --> 40:55.380
Okay.

40:56.380 --> 40:57.422
You can't tell anyone.

40:57.838 --> 40:58.838
We won't.

40:59.005 --> 41:00.047
Not even each other.

41:00.672 --> 41:01.672
Okay.

41:02.213 --> 41:03.588
Nick's party...

41:07.505 --> 41:08.505
is at...

41:09.463 --> 41:10.505
his aunt's house.

41:11.213 --> 41:12.963
We know it's at his au...

41:13.047 --> 41:15.755
Amy, I swear to God,
I need to get out of here.

41:15.838 --> 41:18.047
By the way, I am pretty impressed

41:18.130 --> 41:20.338
with how well you guys
are holding it together.

41:20.422 --> 41:22.047
You're doing fantastic.

41:22.380 --> 41:24.463
What do you mean?

41:24.547 --> 41:27.130
I thought the strawberries
would have hit by now.

41:27.213 --> 41:28.588
Why would strawberries hit?

41:28.672 --> 41:33.172
Because they were dipped
in an unbelievably potent drug.

41:33.255 --> 41:36.213
It's like ayahuasca, but Asian.

41:37.297 --> 41:38.838
Asian-huasca.

41:40.088 --> 41:41.208
I told you guys that, right?

41:41.255 --> 41:43.505
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I can't...

41:43.588 --> 41:46.297
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41:48.630 --> 41:49.838
Pull me back in.

41:50.505 --> 41:51.963
Pull me back in.

41:55.422 --> 41:58.088
Oh, my mom has a scarf that color.

41:58.172 --> 41:59.172
Listen to me.

41:59.713 --> 42:00.713
We're gonna be fine.

42:00.963 --> 42:02.172
One time I threw up,

42:02.255 --> 42:05.630
and my mom caught it in her hands,
'cause she loves me.

42:05.713 --> 42:06.880
We are healthy,

42:07.130 --> 42:08.880
nubile, young women,

42:09.255 --> 42:11.213
and we just need to stay calm.

42:11.630 --> 42:12.880
We are gonna be...

42:33.463 --> 42:34.463
What?

42:34.755 --> 42:36.422
What the fuck?

42:37.172 --> 42:40.005
What the fuck? What is happening?

42:43.297 --> 42:44.963
Why do you look like that?

42:45.047 --> 42:47.088
Uh, Molly, y... you're a fucking doll.

42:47.172 --> 42:49.838
- No, you're a fucking doll.
- What?

42:50.713 --> 42:52.880
Ow! Fuck, that hurt.

42:52.963 --> 42:55.630
And my boobs are too heavy.
I have no core.

42:55.713 --> 42:57.297
Our legs don't bend.

42:57.380 --> 42:59.422
They're twice as long as our torsos.

42:59.505 --> 43:01.630
These proportions are insane!

43:01.713 --> 43:02.963
Where's my chub?

43:03.047 --> 43:04.505
Wait, where are you going?

43:05.047 --> 43:06.807
- This is crazy.
- Wait for me.

43:06.880 --> 43:10.297
I have to see for myself.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.463
Well, I've never done the splits
in my life.

43:13.463 --> 43:14.713
Amy!

43:15.547 --> 43:17.297
Help! Molly, help me!

43:17.380 --> 43:19.547
Oh, my God! Don't look down, Amy, no!

43:19.630 --> 43:21.005
I... I can't reach!

43:21.463 --> 43:23.463
You have to put my heel in your hole.

43:23.547 --> 43:25.880
- My heel...? Your heel in my what?
- Your hole!

43:25.963 --> 43:28.422
- What hole?
- The corn hole!

43:28.505 --> 43:29.880
Oh. Fuck!

43:30.255 --> 43:31.255
Molly!

43:34.130 --> 43:35.588
Oh, my God.

43:35.672 --> 43:37.422
Um, what the fuck am I wearing?

43:39.380 --> 43:40.380
Where's my vag?

43:40.463 --> 43:41.880
Uh, Molly, I have no genitals.

43:41.963 --> 43:44.005
How do I pee? How do I shit?

43:44.088 --> 43:47.130
I mean, I don't even have nipples.
These are just mounds.

43:47.338 --> 43:49.297
My whole body's like a fucking dolphin.

43:49.713 --> 43:50.755
Just... just...

43:51.380 --> 43:53.047
Perfect, round.

43:53.463 --> 43:55.297
- Huge mounds.
- Uh, what?

43:55.380 --> 43:57.338
Look at my body. I am beautiful.

43:57.422 --> 43:59.182
No, don't get sucked in.

43:59.213 --> 44:01.172
This is our nightmare, Amy.

44:01.255 --> 44:03.630
I know this is unrealistic
and bad for women,

44:03.713 --> 44:05.463
but... is it bad?

44:05.547 --> 44:07.088
Because I feel pretty good.

44:07.172 --> 44:08.713
I mean, this ass won't quit.

44:08.797 --> 44:10.755
Amy, use your brain!

44:10.838 --> 44:15.047
I don't need to use my brain.
I just need to be smooth and flexible.

44:15.130 --> 44:17.005
Look at you, you bad bitch.

44:17.797 --> 44:20.130
Okay, that's it, we have to wake up.

44:20.213 --> 44:22.422
My, my, my. Mm.

44:23.672 --> 44:26.963
I think I might, like,
actually stay here for a while.

44:27.047 --> 44:29.380
No, I won't let you do this.

44:29.713 --> 44:31.672
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop!

44:31.755 --> 44:34.088
You need to throw up.

44:34.172 --> 44:37.088
Let me have this body!

44:37.172 --> 44:40.297
Now that the amuse-bouche
of bacon-wrapped dates is over,

44:40.380 --> 44:43.630
why don't we play a rousing round
of <i>J'accuse!</i>

44:51.255 --> 44:53.005
Fuck you, George.

44:54.547 --> 44:56.130
Who is she supposed to be?

44:57.213 --> 44:58.630
The orthodontist.

45:00.380 --> 45:01.838
We're okay.

45:02.505 --> 45:03.505
We're okay.

45:04.005 --> 45:05.130
We did it.

45:05.213 --> 45:08.005
We went... we went to two parties,
we did drugs.

45:08.963 --> 45:10.130
We can say we went out.

45:11.088 --> 45:12.880
- Let's go home.
- What?

45:12.963 --> 45:14.838
No, the plan is to go to Nick's.

45:14.922 --> 45:16.922
We have to stick to the plan.

45:18.088 --> 45:20.630
Dude, nothing has gone
according to plan tonight.

45:20.713 --> 45:23.353
Which is why we have to stick to the plan.
Let's call another Lyft.

45:23.380 --> 45:24.755
Why are you being so pushy?

45:24.838 --> 45:27.630
Honestly, pushy is a compliment.
You know who else was pushy?

45:27.713 --> 45:29.463
Diane Sawyer, Joan of Arc,

45:29.547 --> 45:32.172
- Queen Noor of Jordan...
- I know where Queen Noor is from!

45:32.255 --> 45:34.297
Once we get to Nick's,
all of this will be worth it.

45:34.380 --> 45:37.255
Just forget about about Nick's!
No one will even tell us where it is.

45:37.338 --> 45:39.130
Why are you being so obsessed
with his party?

45:39.213 --> 45:41.422
- Because she loves him.
- Oh, my God.

45:41.505 --> 45:44.255
Gigi, stop doing that!

45:44.338 --> 45:46.172
- What did you say?
- Molly loves Nick.

45:46.255 --> 45:48.463
Can you please stop
repeating that sentence?

45:48.547 --> 45:49.963
Because it's not true.

45:50.047 --> 45:51.505
- Molly hates Nick.
- Thank you.

45:51.588 --> 45:54.255
She projects disgust
to cover up a deep desire.

45:54.338 --> 45:56.713
No. No. N-O. Thanks.

45:56.797 --> 45:59.477
Uh, you actually... You drugged us
and tried to throw us off a boat.

45:59.505 --> 46:00.672
I did. I did.

46:00.755 --> 46:02.838
So nothing you say is of any value to us.

46:02.922 --> 46:04.797
So... Oh, you're...

46:04.880 --> 46:06.400
Yeah, no, you can stop flipping me off

46:06.463 --> 46:08.422
because you should flip off,
so shut the fuck up.

46:08.505 --> 46:11.422
Madam Mayor, what are you doing out here?

46:11.505 --> 46:13.047
George locked himself in the closet.

46:13.130 --> 46:14.130
Fuck!

46:14.297 --> 46:15.463
Dude.

46:15.880 --> 46:16.880
No.

46:19.838 --> 46:20.838
Dude?

46:21.880 --> 46:22.880
No.

46:23.838 --> 46:24.880
I don't like him.

46:25.963 --> 46:27.755
Yes, maybe he is...

46:28.380 --> 46:31.297
classically, traditionally handsome
and weirdly charming,

46:31.380 --> 46:34.880
and maybe my innate biology
registers him as an ideal mate,

46:34.963 --> 46:38.255
and yes, maybe I occasionally fantasize
about him sweeping me off my feet.

46:38.338 --> 46:41.297
And some weaker people
might call that a tiny crush,

46:41.380 --> 46:43.380
but I can ignore it,
I can fight against it,

46:43.463 --> 46:45.213
because we all have weird interests.

46:45.297 --> 46:47.657
And the important thing is
that we just... we shove 'em down

46:47.713 --> 46:49.380
and we never speak about them again.

46:50.797 --> 46:52.672
You don't have to shove anything down.

46:53.422 --> 46:54.588
Yeah.

46:54.672 --> 46:58.297
Yeah. Yeah, I do,
because I can't like him.

46:58.380 --> 47:02.130
Maybe my body can like him
but my mind knows that that's stupid,

47:02.213 --> 47:03.880
because he's just... he's a jock,

47:03.963 --> 47:06.003
and all he cares about
is being cool and having fun,

47:06.047 --> 47:08.880
and he doesn't even look at girls
unless they look like Triple A.

47:08.963 --> 47:11.880
And he definitely doesn't want me
because I'm a butter personality.

47:13.338 --> 47:16.380
How dare you say that
about my best friend?

47:16.463 --> 47:17.755
Amy, you fucking slapped me...

47:17.838 --> 47:20.038
If you ever say anything like that
about yourself again,

47:20.088 --> 47:22.963
I will fucking lay you out, okay?

47:23.172 --> 47:24.963
You are the strongest, coolest,

47:25.047 --> 47:27.047
smartest, most stunningly
gorgeous creature

47:27.130 --> 47:29.172
this high school and this Earth

47:29.255 --> 47:30.255
has ever seen.

47:30.338 --> 47:34.838
And Nick Howland would be so fucking lucky
to be a footnote in your story.

47:35.672 --> 47:36.880
So we're going to his party.

47:36.963 --> 47:38.047
Are you serious?

47:38.130 --> 47:39.297
I am dead serious.

47:40.297 --> 47:42.713
If Nick's what you want,
then that's what you deserve.

47:44.088 --> 47:47.172
How? How are we gonna find out
where the party is?

47:47.755 --> 47:49.130
By doing what we do best.

47:50.047 --> 47:51.713
Motherfuckin' homework.

48:12.838 --> 48:14.731
<i>- I will now be attempting...</i>
- Wait. Look.

48:14.755 --> 48:16.797
<i>...15 pizza boxes.</i>

48:18.463 --> 48:21.672
How many orders that big do you think
Lido's could have filled tonight?

48:22.797 --> 48:23.880
- Genius.
- Yeah.

48:50.297 --> 48:53.047
Two half-cheese, half-sausage pizzas

48:53.338 --> 48:56.130
are just one cheese and one sausage pizza,

48:56.422 --> 48:58.005
you fucking morons.

48:58.088 --> 48:59.088
Jesus.

49:00.297 --> 49:01.297
Oh, God.

49:09.797 --> 49:12.463
- Everybody down! 911! Stay down.
- Oh, my God! What the fuck?

49:12.547 --> 49:14.005
Fuck! What the fuck is this?

49:14.088 --> 49:16.338
- We ask the questions!
- Oh, my God.

49:16.422 --> 49:18.422
Oh, shit, shit!
Is this some Manson family shit?

49:18.505 --> 49:19.922
- What is this?
- No!

49:20.338 --> 49:22.588
No! Everything is gonna be just fine!

49:22.672 --> 49:26.172
You're just gonna give us the address to
where you delivered some pizzas tonight.

49:28.422 --> 49:31.542
Oh, my God. Are you guys out of your
fucking mind? How old are you, by the way?

49:31.588 --> 49:33.380
- Uh...
- Does not matter!

49:33.463 --> 49:35.422
Okay, that voice did not
make you sound older.

49:35.505 --> 49:37.088
So you're basically children,

49:37.172 --> 49:39.547
and you just willingly got in the car
of a strange man.

49:39.630 --> 49:41.005
Do you guys have a weapon?

49:41.630 --> 49:42.630
Yes?

49:42.755 --> 49:45.380
If we claim to have a weapon,
this might be a felony.

49:45.880 --> 49:46.713
Fuck.

49:46.797 --> 49:49.713
- Yes.
- Okay, so you're using your hair as a mask

49:49.797 --> 49:51.672
and trying to rob someone with no weapon.

49:51.755 --> 49:52.922
'Cause the funny thing is,

49:53.005 --> 49:55.338
- I actually have a weapon.
- Fuck!

49:55.422 --> 49:57.130
- Dear God, no! You have a gun?
- Fuck! No!

49:57.213 --> 50:00.172
I keep that to protect myself
from bad people,

50:00.255 --> 50:01.775
something you guys should think about.

50:01.838 --> 50:05.338
Did the... did the possibility
of sexual assault ever enter your minds?

50:06.172 --> 50:07.005
Not really.

50:07.088 --> 50:08.797
Yeah, not really, I can tell.

50:08.880 --> 50:11.213
You were spendin' more time on,
like, the hair

50:11.297 --> 50:13.505
and that... that whole part of it,
maybe, yeah.

50:13.588 --> 50:16.213
'Cause... 'cause we're like...
right by the freeway.

50:16.297 --> 50:19.005
I could have you across the state line
in, like, 40 minutes,

50:19.088 --> 50:21.880
take you to some cabin,
hog tie your ankles,

50:21.963 --> 50:23.880
leave you in a room
with, like, a saucer of milk

50:23.963 --> 50:25.922
and videotape the whole thing
for a couple days.

50:26.005 --> 50:27.088
- What?
- What?

50:27.172 --> 50:28.088
- No.
- Think about that.

50:28.172 --> 50:30.005
- What?
- No, I'm not gonna think about...

50:30.088 --> 50:31.713
We just need you to give us the address

50:31.797 --> 50:34.172
to where you delivered
this huge order tonight.

50:35.588 --> 50:37.297
Oh, shit, that p...

50:40.880 --> 50:42.672
Okay, you know what?

50:43.755 --> 50:45.273
Let me give you the address.

50:45.297 --> 50:46.547
I feel like if I don't...

50:46.630 --> 50:48.439
...you guys are so stupid,

50:48.463 --> 50:52.297
some dog walker's gonna find
your bodies tomorrow under some overpass.

50:52.380 --> 50:54.088
- Okay.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

50:54.172 --> 50:56.064
- Don't show me your pass code!
- Oh, that's fair!

50:56.088 --> 50:58.338
- Okay, sorry.
- That's the whole thing with pass codes.

50:58.422 --> 50:59.880
I'm just copying the address.

50:59.963 --> 51:02.005
That's your private information.

51:02.088 --> 51:04.713
- Thank you!
- Thank you so much!

51:04.797 --> 51:06.088
Oh, my God!

51:06.172 --> 51:07.172
Um...

51:07.422 --> 51:08.463
Quick Q.

51:08.547 --> 51:11.922
Now that we're already in your car,
would you mind driving us there?

51:13.630 --> 51:14.463
Yeah, why not?

51:14.547 --> 51:16.338
- Oh, great!
- I'm being sarcastic!

51:16.422 --> 51:17.981
- Get the fuck out of my car!
- Oh!

51:18.005 --> 51:19.297
- Okay!
- Thank you so much!

51:19.380 --> 51:21.880
Don't trust people. Oh, my God.

51:23.255 --> 51:25.672
Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, my God!

51:25.755 --> 51:29.130
- Oh!
- You were incredible! You were so scary.

51:29.213 --> 51:32.380
If you were a criminal, you'd be
the best fucking criminal in Los Angeles.

51:32.463 --> 51:33.463
Aaah! Oh!

51:33.547 --> 51:36.213
Okay. Great, let's call a chariot.

51:39.130 --> 51:42.463
Fuck! I left my phone in his car!

51:42.547 --> 51:44.630
Why did I have to use a visual aid?

51:44.713 --> 51:45.922
- Wait!
- It's okay!

51:46.005 --> 51:49.172
Amy, Amy, we will get it tomorrow.
It's fine. I'll use mine. I'll use mine.

51:49.922 --> 51:52.380
I'm at two percent?
Why the fuck am I at two percent?

51:52.463 --> 51:54.005
Why is my battery so low?

51:54.547 --> 51:57.755
The porn. We streamed a lot of porn.

51:58.172 --> 51:59.588
Just... Just... Just call a Lyft.

51:59.672 --> 52:01.130
No, I can't call a Lyft,

52:01.213 --> 52:04.922
because if my phone dies and the driver
can't contact us, we are fucked!

52:05.422 --> 52:06.547
Unless...

52:10.380 --> 52:12.020
- Pick up, pick up.
- Who are you calling?

52:12.088 --> 52:14.755
Hi, it's Molly and Amy. We're
at Lido's Pizza on Victory Boulevard.

52:14.838 --> 52:17.088
We are stranded.
Please pick us up, we need...

52:19.505 --> 52:20.505
It died.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.148
- We could hitchhike.
- Are you aching to be murdered?

52:27.172 --> 52:29.380
Well, I'm just throwin' out
suggestions here.

52:42.672 --> 52:43.797
You girls need a ride?

52:47.172 --> 52:48.648
- Shotgun!
- I'll take the front!

52:48.672 --> 52:50.380
So cool! Just gonna...

52:50.630 --> 52:52.023
- Amy, what are you doing?
- No, I...

52:52.047 --> 52:53.922
My... My legs are, like,
half an inch longer...

52:54.005 --> 52:56.338
Okay, you know I get car sick, Amy.
What... Oh!

52:56.422 --> 52:58.273
- Just let me go!
- You're embarrassing me.

52:58.297 --> 52:59.898
- Stop...
- You're embarrassing me!

52:59.922 --> 53:02.505
Thank you so much, Miss Fine.
You totally saved us.

53:02.588 --> 53:05.338
Please. You two saved me
from re-watching <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>

53:05.422 --> 53:07.422
I've seen it, like, 50 times.

53:07.797 --> 53:10.505
Okay, wait, so what is this address
I'm taking you to?

53:10.588 --> 53:12.422
It's, uh...
it's Nick Howland's aunt's house.

53:12.505 --> 53:14.838
It's... It's... It's a party, technically.

53:15.255 --> 53:18.213
You two want me to drive you
to an unsupervised house party?

53:18.297 --> 53:19.838
Oh... well...

53:19.922 --> 53:23.005
Good. I'm glad you guys are having
some fun before graduation. Uh!

53:24.422 --> 53:25.255
Really?

53:25.338 --> 53:28.880
Yes. Oh, my gosh, yes. I don't want
you guys to make the same mistake I did.

53:29.213 --> 53:30.088
What do you mean?

53:30.172 --> 53:32.047
I spent the majority of my 20s

53:32.130 --> 53:34.963
overcompensating for the fact
that I never had fun in high school.

53:35.047 --> 53:38.047
And, you know, the pendulum then swung
in a completely different direction.

53:38.130 --> 53:39.422
I mean, I went crazy.

53:39.505 --> 53:41.797
I had some really dark moments
there in my 20s,

53:41.880 --> 53:44.088
like, some really dark moments.

53:44.922 --> 53:47.880
Like, it was bad.
You know I'm banned from Jamba Juice?

53:48.338 --> 53:51.213
Like, not a single Jamba Juice,
like every Jamba Juice.

53:51.297 --> 53:52.630
That came down from corporate.

53:52.713 --> 53:55.213
Do you know how many Jamba Juices
there are in this country?

53:55.297 --> 53:56.588
Like, a bajillion.

53:56.755 --> 53:58.922
It's a national chain, it's a sensation.

53:59.005 --> 54:01.505
I cannot have another Mango-A-Go-Go
ever again.

54:01.588 --> 54:03.463
But, look, I don't want that for you.

54:03.547 --> 54:05.422
Okay? You still have a chance.

54:05.505 --> 54:07.981
I want you two to go to this party,
and I want you to have fun.

54:08.005 --> 54:10.088
Because tonight is your night.

54:10.172 --> 54:11.047
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

54:11.130 --> 54:11.963
Okay.

54:12.047 --> 54:12.880
- Yes.
- Yes.

54:12.963 --> 54:15.630
So, what are you two wearing?

54:15.713 --> 54:17.005
Uh, we were thinking...

54:17.088 --> 54:18.088
uh...

54:18.713 --> 54:19.797
Well, just this...

54:19.880 --> 54:21.630
this... this, uh... this look.

54:21.713 --> 54:23.505
You do know you guys are matching, right?

54:23.588 --> 54:26.922
We added this embellishment here.

54:27.005 --> 54:30.255
Well, lucky for you two,
I'm a single woman livin' in Los Angeles,

54:30.338 --> 54:32.713
so I got a lot of shit in this car.

54:32.797 --> 54:34.838
Why don't y'all go through
some of those bags?

54:34.922 --> 54:36.402
I'm sorry, we can touch your clothes?

54:36.463 --> 54:38.255
Yes, please. Please, touch my clothes.

54:38.338 --> 54:40.178
- Please get a change of clothes.
- This night!

54:47.630 --> 54:48.838
- Um...
- Um...

54:48.922 --> 54:49.922
- Oh...
- Mmm...

54:50.005 --> 54:52.463
Mmm...

54:52.547 --> 54:53.630
- I have no breath.
- What?

54:53.713 --> 54:54.630
Excuse me?

54:54.713 --> 54:56.523
- Sorry, what?
- I have nowhere to go with this.

54:56.547 --> 54:58.630
- It's too perfect.
- You are literally glowing.

54:58.713 --> 55:01.172
You've hit the level of perfection
and now I'm just...

55:01.255 --> 55:03.314
- Be still my heart.
- You just came out of the water.

55:03.338 --> 55:05.505
You're fresh from the water,
you're a mermaid here.

55:05.588 --> 55:07.505
How are you so fucking shiny?

55:07.588 --> 55:09.422
Can you fetch me an inhaler?
I can't breathe.

55:09.505 --> 55:11.755
- Um, my eyes. Ow, ow!
- I'm physically unable...

55:11.838 --> 55:14.047
Ow, my eyes hurt so bad
from your beauty.

55:14.130 --> 55:15.650
- Um, exsqueeze me, ladies.
- Oh.

55:15.713 --> 55:17.755
- Oh, sorry.
- There's a... a party to get to.

55:19.088 --> 55:21.630
- All right.
- I will see you two inside, all right?

55:21.713 --> 55:23.422
Just kidding. Imagine if I did, though.

55:23.505 --> 55:25.398
- Just kidding.
- Imagine if I just went in.

55:25.422 --> 55:26.338
That'd be weird, right?

55:26.422 --> 55:28.130
That'd be so fun.

55:28.213 --> 55:30.422
- Anyway, see y'all later.
- Okay, bye.

55:38.130 --> 55:39.130
Phew.

55:41.130 --> 55:42.213
Love you.

55:42.297 --> 55:43.297
Love you.

57:09.463 --> 57:11.255
- Whoa.
- Another?

57:11.338 --> 57:12.963
- Here.
- Aaaah!

57:14.005 --> 57:15.005
You good?

57:15.422 --> 57:16.422
Yeah.

57:17.297 --> 57:18.672
- Whoo!
- <i>¡El Presidente!</i>

57:18.755 --> 57:20.213
- And the protest lady!
- Whoo!

57:20.630 --> 57:22.505
Welcome, my little turtledoves.

57:22.880 --> 57:23.922
How are you?

57:24.005 --> 57:26.505
Do you guys want to drink or smoke?
Nothing?

57:26.963 --> 57:28.755
Let me know, okay? I'm your guy tonight.

57:28.838 --> 57:30.463
I'll take care of you. You're the best.

57:30.547 --> 57:32.130
You guys honestly freak me out.

57:33.005 --> 57:35.713
But I'm gonna miss you guys.
Okay? It's all love.

57:36.422 --> 57:40.005
Class of '19... for fuckin' ever! Whoo!

57:42.297 --> 57:43.297
Um...

57:43.422 --> 57:44.255
Ryan.

57:44.380 --> 57:46.047
- Where? Where?
- Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.

57:46.672 --> 57:47.547
Oh, God.

57:47.630 --> 57:49.470
- She's glowing.
- Go get her.

57:49.505 --> 57:50.505
Hug me.

57:52.172 --> 57:53.332
- Okay. Get her.
- Phew. Okay.

57:53.380 --> 57:54.672
Get her. Flick the bean!

57:55.630 --> 57:57.672
Molly, here's to you, gorgeous.

57:57.755 --> 57:59.422
- Thank you.
- Of course, of course.

57:59.755 --> 58:02.422
Tanner, where's the rubbing alcohol?
There's nothing strong enough.

58:02.505 --> 58:03.672
- No.
- Yep.

58:03.755 --> 58:05.255
- No.
- I'm here.

58:05.338 --> 58:06.338
How?

58:06.588 --> 58:07.797
I'm gonna go downstairs.

58:10.172 --> 58:11.213
Well...

58:11.297 --> 58:12.297
Bye, Gigi.

58:25.880 --> 58:28.713
- I'm so stoked you're here, dude.
- Thanks.

58:29.422 --> 58:31.088
I've always wanted you to come out.

58:31.172 --> 58:32.672
Oh, I-I am out.

58:33.797 --> 58:35.713
I came out in the tenth grade.

58:37.213 --> 58:40.963
No. I meant, like, come out
and hang out on the weekend.

58:42.880 --> 58:44.838
Oh, right, that... Hang out.

58:44.922 --> 58:47.505
- Yeah, that's... that's what I meant also.
- You know,

58:47.588 --> 58:50.422
you need to have a little bit of fun
before you go to Africa.

58:50.505 --> 58:51.922
You remembered I'm going to Africa?

58:52.005 --> 58:54.505
Of course. Aren't you gonna go to,
like, Uganda or something?

58:54.588 --> 58:57.297
Botswana. They'd kill me in Uganda.

58:57.380 --> 58:58.213
Why?

58:58.297 --> 59:00.588
'Cause that's country's
not really a fan of gay people.

59:01.047 --> 59:02.672
Oh, shit, that's crazy.

59:02.755 --> 59:04.672
Would you be afraid to go to Uganda...

59:04.755 --> 59:07.172
- Karaoke in the guest room!
- Jesus!

59:07.255 --> 59:09.463
God, I've missed you. Fuck.

59:09.880 --> 59:12.797
Do you wanna go do karaoke
in the guest room? I love that girl.

59:12.880 --> 59:13.713
Yeah.

59:13.797 --> 59:14.880
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

59:20.088 --> 59:21.547
Uh, elbows.

59:21.713 --> 59:23.338
Oh, fuck. Re-rack, please?

59:23.713 --> 59:25.380
Holy shit!

59:25.755 --> 59:27.297
Wait, Molly's here?

59:27.380 --> 59:30.047
What a fuckin' compliment
to get Molly to roll.

59:30.130 --> 59:31.838
Dude, are you actually here right now?

59:31.922 --> 59:34.838
Is this some mirage?
Am I fucking losing my mind?

59:34.922 --> 59:37.797
Or did I actually get President Molly
to come out on her weekend?

59:37.880 --> 59:39.838
It's a purely ceremonial visit.

59:39.922 --> 59:42.630
Okay, okay. Hey, why don't you sit here?

59:42.713 --> 59:44.172
Yeah, right next to me, please.

59:44.255 --> 59:45.797
Sit here and let's go.

59:45.880 --> 59:48.963
I've been fuckin' waitin' for this
since, like, seventh grade.

59:49.130 --> 59:50.547
- Please. It's for you.
- Oh.

59:50.630 --> 59:52.088
This song goes out to my cast.

01:00:03.213 --> 01:00:04.213
Shh.

01:00:23.672 --> 01:00:24.797
Miss Fine.

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:26.922
Miss...

01:00:27.422 --> 01:00:29.130
...Fine.

01:00:29.505 --> 01:00:30.630
Señora Fine.

01:00:32.755 --> 01:00:34.463
You ever made love to a Mexican?

01:00:36.047 --> 01:00:38.547
Ooh, ooh, whoo!

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:39.880
Hey, listen, this pong

01:00:39.963 --> 01:00:41.683
- is actually supposed to be my thing.
- Hm?

01:00:41.713 --> 01:00:44.255
So if you could just tone it down
for my sake, my self-esteem...

01:00:44.338 --> 01:00:46.547
No, I think you just have
to step up your game.

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:49.047
- Oh!
- You just have to rise to my level.

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:51.505
- It's not my fault.
- To her level.

01:00:51.588 --> 01:00:54.880
It's crazy we haven't hung out
outside of school before, you know.

01:00:54.963 --> 01:00:57.047
I used to think you were all work
and no play, but...

01:00:58.005 --> 01:00:59.380
you're actually pretty fun.

01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:01.505
I...

01:01:01.588 --> 01:01:02.588
I am fun.

01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.130
Okay.

01:01:13.213 --> 01:01:14.213
Hi, Miss Fine.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:15.838
Hi, Theo.

01:01:37.922 --> 01:01:38.922
Whoo!

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:58.380
This is amazing.

01:01:58.713 --> 01:01:59.797
You're amazing.

01:02:01.047 --> 01:02:02.047
You're 20, right?

01:02:02.755 --> 01:02:03.755
Yeah.

01:02:07.713 --> 01:02:09.255
You've got a mic. You've gotta sing.

01:02:09.338 --> 01:02:10.630
- No.
- Please.

01:02:10.713 --> 01:02:12.963
- No.
- Come on. Please?

01:02:13.338 --> 01:02:14.463
Do it for me. Come on, Amy.

01:02:14.547 --> 01:02:16.005
For you, okay...

01:02:36.338 --> 01:02:39.213
You can tell she's not supporting.
No breath control. But it's good.

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:41.297
- It's on pitch. Yeah.Yeah.
- I support you, okay?

01:02:46.255 --> 01:02:49.130
Oh, my God! Oh!

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.047
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:52.130
Fuckin'...

01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:55.047
Oh, God!

01:02:55.588 --> 01:02:58.380
- Of course.
- Nick, you need more...

01:02:58.463 --> 01:03:00.314
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:03:00.338 --> 01:03:01.630
You need more of an arc.

01:03:02.088 --> 01:03:04.172
Like... no, too much flick. Like, hoo.

01:03:04.255 --> 01:03:07.255
See, well, that's easy for you to say
when you're, like, three feet tall.

01:03:07.338 --> 01:03:08.922
I'm lookin' straight down at it.

01:03:09.297 --> 01:03:10.338
How tall are you?

01:03:12.297 --> 01:03:13.297
Well...

01:03:13.838 --> 01:03:15.297
How tall do you think I am?

01:03:24.422 --> 01:03:26.088
Five-four?

01:03:27.463 --> 01:03:29.297
My teammates usually aren't this mean.

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.340
Oh, no, no, no,
they're usually blonde and skinny,

01:03:31.422 --> 01:03:33.838
- and they don't drink carbs.
- Uh... No, no way, okay?

01:03:33.922 --> 01:03:35.297
I fuck with Hufflepuffs.

01:03:36.338 --> 01:03:38.172
Hu... Hufflepuff, like <i>Harry Potter?</i>

01:03:38.255 --> 01:03:39.255
Yeah.

01:03:39.338 --> 01:03:41.172
I mean, what, are you, like a...

01:03:42.838 --> 01:03:44.630
half-Slytherin, half...

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:46.922
Ravenclaw, yep?

01:03:47.797 --> 01:03:49.838
That is exactly what I am.

01:03:50.338 --> 01:03:51.505
Yeah, you are.

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:55.463
Oh, fuck.

01:03:55.505 --> 01:03:58.606
Okay, see, I'm gonna go take care of them,
make sure they don't kill themselves.

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:00.189
- But you stay right here, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:04:00.213 --> 01:04:02.505
Okay, don't move. I'll come back
in a moment. Don't move.

01:04:02.588 --> 01:04:04.755
- I'm not gonna move.
- Don't move. Yeah?

01:04:04.838 --> 01:04:08.172
- I feel like you're gonna move.
- No, I'm not... I'm not gonna move.

01:04:08.255 --> 01:04:09.297
- Don't move.
- Okay.

01:08:04.088 --> 01:08:06.488
Oh, my God, there you are.
How's it going? Did you find Ryan?

01:08:06.547 --> 01:08:07.713
Did you guys go in the pool?

01:08:07.797 --> 01:08:09.213
- What's going on?
- Molly...

01:08:09.297 --> 01:08:12.017
Things are going so well over here,
like really, really, really well.

01:08:12.047 --> 01:08:13.727
I'm being so mean to him,
but it's working.

01:08:13.755 --> 01:08:15.898
We talked about <i>Harry Potter.</i>
He knows I'm a Slytherin.

01:08:15.922 --> 01:08:17.856
- He seems to like it.
- I think we should go home.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.921
Wait, what? No. Just... just dry off.

01:08:20.005 --> 01:08:22.130
No, I think we need to leave.
Come on, let's go.

01:08:22.212 --> 01:08:23.755
Are you nuts? No. He...

01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:24.755
- Nick is fully...
- No.

01:08:24.837 --> 01:08:26.171
He's fully flirting with me.

01:08:26.255 --> 01:08:27.335
This actually might happen.

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.023
- Listen to me, this might happen.
- No, no.

01:08:29.046 --> 01:08:31.130
Molly, please, I'm asking you,
let's just go, okay?

01:08:31.212 --> 01:08:33.630
- Ame, just go find Ryan. It'll be great.
- Malala!

01:08:35.005 --> 01:08:36.005
Amy, no.

01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:39.962
- Are you kidding?
- No, I...

01:08:40.046 --> 01:08:43.880
I've done whatever you wanted all night,
and I'm calling Malala, so come with me.

01:08:43.962 --> 01:08:46.923
No, I'm not leaving just because
you're doing the thing that you always do.

01:08:48.712 --> 01:08:50.130
What is that supposed to mean?

01:08:50.212 --> 01:08:51.796
Just... You...

01:08:52.296 --> 01:08:55.380
You talk a big game, and then you give up
just when things get uncomfortable.

01:08:55.462 --> 01:08:58.337
Like you jumped in the pool, and now
you're sad that you're wet, like...

01:08:58.421 --> 01:09:00.341
- That's bullshit, Moll, that's bullshit.
- No...

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.773
If I didn't drag you to do things,
you just wouldn't do them.

01:09:02.796 --> 01:09:04.296
You... you... you don't drag me.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.921
You force me to do
whatever you want to do.

01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:08.671
What does that even mean?

01:09:08.755 --> 01:09:11.837
You decide what we do and when we do it,

01:09:11.921 --> 01:09:13.562
and then we always
have to do it together,

01:09:13.587 --> 01:09:14.856
- all the time.
- I have to decide

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.587
because you literally decide nothing.

01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:18.712
Like, I do all the heavy lifting
in our friendship.

01:09:18.796 --> 01:09:21.171
- You never take charge.
- I take charge all the time!

01:09:21.255 --> 01:09:22.712
You never take charge!

01:09:22.796 --> 01:09:25.796
I always have to push you.
Without me, you wouldn't do anything.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.380
- I'm going to Africa without you.
- Yeah, I encouraged your summer abroad.

01:09:29.462 --> 01:09:31.546
I'm not going for the summer.

01:09:32.171 --> 01:09:33.962
I'm going for the entire year.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.880
What?

01:09:40.212 --> 01:09:41.671
I'm taking a gap year.

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.337
I deferred Columbia until next fall.

01:09:45.255 --> 01:09:46.421
When did you decide that?

01:09:46.505 --> 01:09:47.505
When I applied.

01:09:49.505 --> 01:09:52.046
In January? You've been lying to me
since January?

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:55.213
Yeah, because I knew if I told you,
you'd bully me into staying.

01:09:55.297 --> 01:09:57.380
So all our schedules are gonna be off now.

01:09:57.463 --> 01:09:58.838
We're not gonna graduate together,

01:09:58.922 --> 01:10:00.682
not gonna go
on a post-college trip together,

01:10:00.755 --> 01:10:02.922
we're not gonna move to DC together,
our whole plan...

01:10:03.005 --> 01:10:04.505
That was your plan!

01:10:04.588 --> 01:10:05.588
That was never my plan.

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:07.547
- It's always your plan!
- I can't believe you!

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:09.470
You think
that going to Africa makes you tough,

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:11.939
and you weren't even fucking brave enough
to tell me about it!

01:10:11.963 --> 01:10:13.338
You're a fucking coward, Amy!

01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:14.713
You're selfish and mean!

01:10:14.797 --> 01:10:15.838
You're a bad friend!

01:10:15.922 --> 01:10:17.463
You're a fucking bad friend...

01:11:06.797 --> 01:11:07.797
What the fuck?

01:11:10.172 --> 01:11:11.172
I locked that.

01:11:16.463 --> 01:11:17.755
Well, I guess you didn't.

01:11:18.838 --> 01:11:19.963
What's wrong with you?

01:11:20.422 --> 01:11:21.505
Fight with your wife?

01:11:21.588 --> 01:11:23.422
Can you please just...

01:11:24.088 --> 01:11:25.088
leave me alone?

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:26.505
Why are you even at a party?

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.005
Shouldn't you be, like, marching
in some meaningless protest somewhere,

01:11:30.088 --> 01:11:32.338
or, I don't know,
in your bed doing homework?

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.963
You don't even know me.

01:11:34.047 --> 01:11:36.130
- Pretty sure I do.
- No.

01:11:36.213 --> 01:11:38.963
You're just one of those people
who claims they're honest,

01:11:39.047 --> 01:11:40.630
or calling people on their shit,

01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:42.172
when you're really just mean.

01:11:45.213 --> 01:11:46.213
Wow.

01:11:48.005 --> 01:11:49.213
Wow, I take it back.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:54.880
You...

01:11:55.338 --> 01:11:56.630
are a badass...

01:11:57.422 --> 01:11:59.088
who takes no prisoners...

01:12:01.005 --> 01:12:04.380
and cries in the bathroom at parties.

01:12:10.047 --> 01:12:11.422
Why are you so cruel?

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.547
I just don't like meek people.

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.380
And you?

01:12:18.505 --> 01:12:21.505
You're like Molly's little sidekick bitch.

01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:24.630
Well, you're just a basic hot girl
who's gonna peak in high school.

01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:55.672
When'd you get here?

01:12:57.047 --> 01:12:58.047
A while ago.

01:12:58.797 --> 01:13:02.213
See Amy? She fucking freaked out on me.
I don't know what's wrong with her.

01:13:02.297 --> 01:13:04.797
Do people really think
I had sex with a prostitute?

01:13:07.755 --> 01:13:08.838
You didn't?

01:13:09.172 --> 01:13:10.172
No.

01:13:10.838 --> 01:13:12.213
Of course not. I haven't...

01:13:14.172 --> 01:13:15.797
I haven't slept with anybody.

01:13:19.755 --> 01:13:21.755
No one in this entire school
knows me at all.

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:26.463
Except Gigi.

01:13:26.547 --> 01:13:29.172
I'm a golden starfish!

01:13:31.588 --> 01:13:33.630
Gigi, the girl who jumped off your boat

01:13:33.713 --> 01:13:36.130
and gave you a prison tat
while you were sleeping?

01:13:36.213 --> 01:13:37.505
Oh, that wasn't about me.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.380
She's a sad person, you know?

01:13:41.755 --> 01:13:43.880
And yeah, she may be a little nuts, but...

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:47.755
she's the most loyal person I've ever met.

01:13:48.422 --> 01:13:51.963
I mean, she once tried to shiv our mailman
because she thought he laughed at me.

01:13:52.797 --> 01:13:55.088
Turns out, he wasn't...
he wasn't laughing at me at all.

01:13:55.172 --> 01:13:56.797
He was just lookin' at a meme...

01:13:57.255 --> 01:13:58.255
on his phone.

01:13:58.422 --> 01:14:01.297
Plus, not everyone's lucky enough
to find someone like you and Amy.

01:14:01.755 --> 01:14:04.255
I'm just doin' my best
so I can get out of here and...

01:14:04.713 --> 01:14:07.297
find some people
who are into the same weird shit I'm into.

01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:10.713
Not like sex stuff.
I mean, like, you know...

01:14:12.213 --> 01:14:13.672
airplanes and musicals.

01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:15.172
What?

01:14:16.297 --> 01:14:18.047
I wanna design fuckin' airplanes.

01:14:18.755 --> 01:14:21.797
Yeah, get rich off that, and then use
the cash to produce some new musicals.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.000
Enough with the revivals already.
It's total bullshit.

01:14:24.047 --> 01:14:25.922
Audiences deserve something original.

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:27.130
I think.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:29.297
I don't know.

01:14:29.922 --> 01:14:33.297
I should probably go make sure
that's not an actual dead man's float.

01:14:37.005 --> 01:14:38.755
Well, see you at graduation, Molly.

01:14:55.755 --> 01:14:57.547
Whoa.

01:15:01.255 --> 01:15:02.463
- Um...
- Are you okay?

01:15:02.755 --> 01:15:04.338
Yeah, sorry, I just, uh...

01:15:05.338 --> 01:15:07.098
I just got a little dizzy
for a second there.

01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:09.213
- Um...
- We can stop if you want.

01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:11.463
No, we are not stopping.

01:15:11.547 --> 01:15:12.588
Okay.

01:15:27.005 --> 01:15:28.797
I'm sorry.

01:15:30.047 --> 01:15:31.713
- Oh, oh! Oh.
- Are you okay?

01:15:31.797 --> 01:15:33.130
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

01:15:49.255 --> 01:15:50.880
I should probably take off...

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:52.630
mine too.

01:15:52.838 --> 01:15:53.838
Yeah.

01:16:04.463 --> 01:16:05.463
It's a nice dress.

01:16:05.838 --> 01:16:07.963
It's all she had.

01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:10.463
Miss Fine.

01:16:10.547 --> 01:16:12.547
Oh, my God. Of course.

01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:39.630
Um...

01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:42.380
How... How... How is that for you?

01:16:42.922 --> 01:16:44.547
Um, it's okay.

01:16:45.505 --> 01:16:49.088
Is... Is there, like, another way
you would prefer, or, like, is this...

01:16:49.172 --> 01:16:50.713
I ju... um...

01:16:51.963 --> 01:16:54.203
I don't think that's the hole
you think it is.

01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:56.547
- Oh, my God.
- No, it's okay.

01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:59.172
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

01:16:59.255 --> 01:17:00.255
Oh, my God.

01:17:00.338 --> 01:17:02.672
I just... I'm not used
to approaching it from that angle,

01:17:02.755 --> 01:17:04.088
and my... my geometry was off...

01:17:04.172 --> 01:17:06.505
- Seriously, don't worry about it.
- I'm sorry.

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:18.130
Mm...

01:17:18.297 --> 01:17:20.713
- Wh...
- Are... are you good?

01:17:22.588 --> 01:17:24.422
Aah! Oh, my God!

01:17:24.505 --> 01:17:27.005
What the... what the fuck? Oh!

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:29.588
- I'm so sorry.
- What the fuck?

01:17:29.672 --> 01:17:32.338
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
- Eww!

01:17:32.588 --> 01:17:33.505
Um...

01:17:33.588 --> 01:17:34.588
Are... Are you okay?

01:17:34.713 --> 01:17:35.922
Amy, just go.

01:17:38.172 --> 01:17:39.172
Please go.

01:17:40.547 --> 01:17:42.463
Oh, sh... Please fucking leave.

01:17:42.547 --> 01:17:45.047
- Sorry, I'm going as fast as I can.
- Go!

01:18:27.088 --> 01:18:28.672
Hey, have you guys seen Amy?

01:18:28.755 --> 01:18:29.755
- No.
- No.

01:18:33.505 --> 01:18:34.380
What the...

01:18:34.463 --> 01:18:35.463
Wait.

01:18:35.547 --> 01:18:37.505
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:18:37.588 --> 01:18:39.963
Amy! Amy! Amy!

01:18:40.338 --> 01:18:43.922
We're fucking sitting ducks. They're gonna
come in here, they're gonna find us.

01:18:44.005 --> 01:18:45.380
Shut the fuck up, Rob.

01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:55.047
I am not a coward.

01:18:58.755 --> 01:18:59.797
All right, focus up.

01:19:00.755 --> 01:19:03.380
Wait for my signal.
I'm gonna create a diversion.

01:19:07.255 --> 01:19:08.255
What?

01:19:09.547 --> 01:19:10.547
Hey!

01:19:36.672 --> 01:19:37.672
No.

01:19:38.922 --> 01:19:39.922
Really?

01:20:07.088 --> 01:20:10.713
You know, this is why people say
I gave guys roadside assistance, right?

01:20:12.338 --> 01:20:14.213
I gave them a ride home, that's all.

01:20:19.213 --> 01:20:20.613
Okay, that's not true, I blew them.

01:20:20.672 --> 01:20:23.512
But it's not like they ran out of gas
and I showed up to suck their dick

01:20:23.547 --> 01:20:24.713
while they waited for help.

01:20:24.797 --> 01:20:27.672
We hooked up in their car.
It makes sense to hook up in a car.

01:20:27.755 --> 01:20:30.088
I'm not gonna, like,
suck a dick at my own home

01:20:30.172 --> 01:20:32.297
where my father can walk in
at any moment.

01:20:32.547 --> 01:20:35.172
Also, I wanna enjoy it. Fucking sue me.

01:20:36.588 --> 01:20:37.922
That makes a lot of sense.

01:20:46.213 --> 01:20:47.838
You know what the worst part is?

01:20:49.255 --> 01:20:51.297
All the fucking girls call me that, too.

01:20:54.463 --> 01:20:58.880
I knew, like, Ben and Max
and Dick Splinter would say stupid shit.

01:21:03.505 --> 01:21:04.505
I just...

01:21:04.838 --> 01:21:08.880
I didn't think the girls would, too.

01:21:08.963 --> 01:21:10.338
Amy never called you that.

01:21:13.713 --> 01:21:15.713
I'm sorry, I'm genuinely sorry.

01:21:18.463 --> 01:21:21.630
Just, like, please don't call me Triple A
at Yale next year.

01:21:21.713 --> 01:21:25.088
I just want people to know my real name.

01:21:25.463 --> 01:21:26.505
Of course.

01:21:27.505 --> 01:21:28.338
Annabel.

01:21:28.422 --> 01:21:30.380
Fuck, dude, no, not right now.

01:21:30.463 --> 01:21:31.797
I'm sorry. That was bad.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.160
- That wasn't my best.
- Come on.

01:21:33.213 --> 01:21:34.981
- Jesus Christ.
- That was embarrassing for me.

01:21:35.005 --> 01:21:36.505
I'm sorry for that too.

01:21:40.088 --> 01:21:41.880
Wait, where the fuck do you live?

01:22:01.672 --> 01:22:02.712
[phone buzzes

01:22:08.713 --> 01:22:10.172
Fuck!

01:22:15.838 --> 01:22:16.838
What?

01:22:21.755 --> 01:22:22.588
<i>All right.</i>

01:22:22.672 --> 01:22:25.130
<i>- Well, just so you know, I know my rights.</i>
- Oh, my God.

01:22:25.213 --> 01:22:27.880
<i>There are more prisons than colleges
in the United States.</i>

01:22:27.963 --> 01:22:29.314
<i>- Did you know that?
- You're right.</i>

01:22:29.338 --> 01:22:32.505
<i>And it costs $71,000
to house an inmate in California.</i>

01:22:32.588 --> 01:22:34.028
<i>That's more than Harvard.</i>

01:22:34.088 --> 01:22:35.880
<i>- Yeah, really?
- Well, it seems excessive.</i>

01:22:35.963 --> 01:22:38.463
<i>Shotgun. Just kidding. I don't have one.</i>

01:23:03.588 --> 01:23:06.308
Oh, I'm actually... I'm actually here
for someone else. I'm so sorry.

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:08.422
- My mistake. My mistake. My mistake.
- Oh, my God!

01:23:09.755 --> 01:23:11.255
Fuck you, dude.

01:23:11.338 --> 01:23:13.130
Dude, you're in full-on jail.

01:23:15.005 --> 01:23:16.255
Yeah, I know.

01:23:16.713 --> 01:23:18.088
I'm so sorry.

01:23:19.047 --> 01:23:20.672
I mean, it's okay.

01:23:20.755 --> 01:23:24.047
I'm gonna have to pay a fine
and go before the judge,

01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:25.672
- but we both...
- No, I'm sorry.

01:23:26.297 --> 01:23:28.297
Uh... I know women apologize too much,

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.340
but, in this case,
I have so much to be sorry for.

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:31.380
I was so selfish.

01:23:31.463 --> 01:23:32.713
I... I was being a coward.

01:23:32.797 --> 01:23:33.963
You called Malala.

01:23:34.047 --> 01:23:35.505
I lied to you, Moll.

01:23:35.588 --> 01:23:39.130
You were trying to save me from seeing
Nick rub his boner all up against Ryan.

01:23:39.213 --> 01:23:41.005
Oh, my God, can you believe that,
by the way?

01:23:41.088 --> 01:23:42.630
No. Honestly, no.

01:23:42.713 --> 01:23:44.673
I would have guessed
that Nick hooked up with Theo

01:23:44.755 --> 01:23:46.075
before I would have guessed Ryan.

01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:48.713
Nick and Theo do have great chemistry.

01:23:48.797 --> 01:23:50.505
Divine. I mean, it's palpable.

01:23:53.297 --> 01:23:56.047
I'm sorry I'm so controlling.

01:23:57.630 --> 01:24:00.213
I just can't imagine my life without you.

01:24:03.922 --> 01:24:07.255
You are the motherfucker who got arrested
the night before graduation.

01:24:07.338 --> 01:24:09.047
Oh, my God, graduation.

01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:11.505
Molly, what... what time is it?
You have to go.

01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:13.880
Yeah, why do you think I'm here?
You're coming with me.

01:24:13.963 --> 01:24:15.880
Dude, no, I am screwed. I can't leave.

01:24:15.963 --> 01:24:17.297
- You have to go.
- Amy...

01:24:17.755 --> 01:24:19.505
I am not graduating without you.

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:23.713
So either I get arrested
and I join you in there or we go together.

01:24:24.172 --> 01:24:25.172
How?

01:24:27.838 --> 01:24:29.797
We're gonna trade some information.

01:24:30.505 --> 01:24:32.422
Because we have seen this man.

01:24:32.505 --> 01:24:33.505
What?

01:24:33.963 --> 01:24:36.148
- Is that Jared's car?
- I'll explain later.

01:24:36.172 --> 01:24:38.023
- Am I driving?
- Of course you're driving!

01:24:38.047 --> 01:24:40.255
- Need this. Go!
- Oh, that was my fault!

01:24:40.338 --> 01:24:42.630
Okay, Waze says 19 minutes.
We're doing it in seven.

01:24:43.005 --> 01:24:44.005
Let's fuckin' do this.

01:25:02.755 --> 01:25:04.047
Ah...

01:25:04.130 --> 01:25:05.810
Hey, guys, let's go ahead and take a seat.

01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:08.922
Stop!

01:25:15.505 --> 01:25:16.505
Ooh.

01:25:16.922 --> 01:25:17.922
Hey, Evelyn.

01:25:18.797 --> 01:25:19.797
Um...

01:25:20.172 --> 01:25:21.380
I just wanted to say...

01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:23.797
Have a great summer.

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:26.005
That's what the kids are doin', right?

01:25:26.255 --> 01:25:27.422
Have a great...

01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:29.963
All right, cool.

01:25:30.047 --> 01:25:31.713
Cool, cool, cool. Sickening.

01:25:31.797 --> 01:25:33.130
Morning, my queen.

01:25:33.672 --> 01:25:34.672
Hi.

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:36.630
So last night was amazing.

01:25:37.213 --> 01:25:39.213
Can I see you again?

01:25:42.713 --> 01:25:44.088
Mmm...

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:45.838
Good luck at Google next year, okay?

01:25:45.922 --> 01:25:47.213
Okay.

01:25:47.588 --> 01:25:48.588
Bye.

01:25:49.505 --> 01:25:50.505
Bye.

01:25:52.713 --> 01:25:54.088
Did you fuck Miss Fine?

01:26:05.130 --> 01:26:06.797
Ha... Has anybody seen, uh, Molly?

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.963
'Cause we've gotta get started.
She kicks it off. Huh? Nobody?

01:26:10.255 --> 01:26:12.380
'Cause I haven't seen her either
since yesterday

01:26:12.463 --> 01:26:14.564
when we were at school, all of us,
at school together.

01:26:14.588 --> 01:26:16.588
So, Molly warned me
she might be a little late

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:18.032
and tapped me to start her speech.

01:26:18.088 --> 01:26:20.338
- Molly is gonna be late to graduation?
- Yeah.

01:26:20.422 --> 01:26:22.297
- That doesn't sound like her.
- Right.

01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:25.755
Well, uh, she also asked me
to remind you that... um...

01:26:26.630 --> 01:26:27.463
um...

01:26:27.547 --> 01:26:28.547
I got it, uh...

01:26:28.922 --> 01:26:31.838
This sort of thing happens all the time
on the Senate floor.

01:26:31.922 --> 01:26:33.922
And if a senator isn't present for a vote,

01:26:34.005 --> 01:26:36.880
- a proxy can call for a motion...
- Okay. That does sound like her.

01:26:36.963 --> 01:26:39.314
- ...for the vote to take place...
- I got it. Thanks, Jared.

01:26:39.338 --> 01:26:40.606
- ...in her absence.
- Okay, so...

01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:41.630
So she tapped you?

01:26:41.713 --> 01:26:43.088
- Tapped me.
- Okay.

01:26:43.922 --> 01:26:46.755
Yeah, fuck it, I approve, you're up.
You're gonna kick it off.

01:26:47.088 --> 01:26:49.422
- Oh. Oh.
- Okay, there he goes.

01:26:49.505 --> 01:26:51.672
- Yeah, yeah, Shantay, you stay, honey!
- Oh, Jared!

01:26:51.755 --> 01:26:53.005
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:26:54.172 --> 01:26:55.172
Look at you.

01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:05.463
Good morning.

01:27:05.547 --> 01:27:06.630
Good morning.

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:10.630
I'm Molly Davidson.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.880
Ah...

01:27:22.838 --> 01:27:24.338
I am a woman.

01:27:24.422 --> 01:27:26.505
- I am a powerful woman.
- My boy!

01:27:26.588 --> 01:27:30.672
And I'm ready to take the fists
of my femininity to the status quo.

01:27:30.755 --> 01:27:32.880
Straight, white man,

01:27:32.963 --> 01:27:35.088
your time is...

01:27:35.172 --> 01:27:36.172
Okay.

01:27:48.672 --> 01:27:52.838
Oh, my God, my car is fucked up.

01:28:03.963 --> 01:28:06.588
All right, I'm gonna go take my seat.
I'm gonna go take my seat.

01:28:06.672 --> 01:28:09.630
Come on. Come on! Look who made it!

01:28:09.713 --> 01:28:11.088
Whoo!

01:28:11.422 --> 01:28:13.088
- Amy!
- Amy!

01:28:15.255 --> 01:28:17.505
Whooooo!

01:28:43.088 --> 01:28:44.130
Thank you.

01:28:50.422 --> 01:28:51.547
Okay.

01:28:51.630 --> 01:28:54.005
Looks like Jared did a pretty good job.

01:28:54.088 --> 01:28:55.255
Yes, he did.

01:28:55.338 --> 01:28:56.588
Yes, he did.

01:28:56.672 --> 01:28:58.130
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

01:28:59.713 --> 01:29:00.713
I...

01:29:04.588 --> 01:29:05.672
I was so...

01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:08.005
scared of you.

01:29:08.088 --> 01:29:10.755
I felt like I had to prove
that I was better than you.

01:29:11.338 --> 01:29:12.338
But really...

01:29:13.213 --> 01:29:15.422
I don't know any more than you guys.

01:29:15.505 --> 01:29:19.172
All I know is that
we have a lot more to learn.

01:29:23.838 --> 01:29:25.172
'Cause this part's over.

01:29:26.463 --> 01:29:27.672
And that's so sad.

01:29:29.005 --> 01:29:30.797
But it was great, wasn't it?

01:29:33.213 --> 01:29:36.547
Things are never gonna be the same,
but... it was perfect.

01:29:40.005 --> 01:29:42.047
And... And I may not have before, but...

01:29:42.588 --> 01:29:43.922
I see you now.

01:29:45.338 --> 01:29:47.463
And you're all pretty great.

01:29:48.047 --> 01:29:50.630
Don't let college fuck it up.

01:29:50.713 --> 01:29:51.547
Congratulations.

01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:53.005
I... I see you.

01:29:54.172 --> 01:29:57.213
Whooo! Whoo-whoo-whoo!

01:30:00.005 --> 01:30:01.005
Yes!

01:30:04.213 --> 01:30:06.255
Okay. Okay.

01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:09.380
That went over,

01:30:09.463 --> 01:30:11.630
but I will not be cutting down
my allotted time.

01:30:11.713 --> 01:30:12.838
Gigi, hit the track.

01:30:18.338 --> 01:30:19.898
- That's pretty good.
- Know what's good?

01:30:19.922 --> 01:30:21.047
If you roll these...

01:30:21.130 --> 01:30:22.770
- Hm?
- ...and then you'll have more room.

01:30:22.797 --> 01:30:25.380
- Oh, probably not rolling them.
- Yeah, but...

01:30:25.463 --> 01:30:27.838
- Well, why does it have to be...
- Oh! Look! Oh!

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:29.547
- God, you're bringing Lingling.
- Mm.

01:30:29.630 --> 01:30:32.172
- Well...
- Oh, Lingling!

01:30:32.255 --> 01:30:33.380
- Um...
- No.

01:30:33.463 --> 01:30:35.713
- Please be good to my Amy.
- I've gotta pack up.

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:37.856
- Make her feel like she's not so lonely.
- Pack it up.

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.255
Make her feel good. Mm!

01:30:39.338 --> 01:30:42.005
- Amy, make it stop.
- Gotta put that in the old suitcase.

01:30:42.088 --> 01:30:44.297
Please don't put your face on the face.

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:45.380
Make it stop.

01:30:45.422 --> 01:30:47.755
- On the head, on the neck.
- Not the nose.

01:30:47.838 --> 01:30:48.963
- I got...
- Amy, there's...

01:30:49.047 --> 01:30:50.088
Look who she's bringing.

01:30:50.172 --> 01:30:51.047
Okay.

01:30:51.130 --> 01:30:52.213
Lingling?

01:30:52.297 --> 01:30:53.672
- No!
- Oh, let me get in there.

01:30:53.755 --> 01:30:55.172
No, no...

01:31:00.297 --> 01:31:01.297
Uh...

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:03.505
Amy, there's, uh, someone here to see you.

01:31:03.797 --> 01:31:04.838
- Hm?
- Who?

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.880
What?

01:31:07.922 --> 01:31:09.505
- Oh.
- Why is she here?

01:31:09.588 --> 01:31:10.588
Excuse me.

01:31:11.463 --> 01:31:13.922
Amy, why is she here?

01:31:25.505 --> 01:31:26.505
Hey.

01:31:26.588 --> 01:31:27.588
Hey.

01:31:28.047 --> 01:31:30.213
I figured I'd bring back your clothes.

01:31:30.463 --> 01:31:32.422
Oh. Thanks so much.

01:31:33.255 --> 01:31:35.963
I don't...
I don't usually leave my underwear

01:31:36.047 --> 01:31:37.380
in... in places that are...

01:31:37.463 --> 01:31:39.088
that aren't my room.

01:31:40.213 --> 01:31:41.213
Yeah, I figured.

01:31:42.547 --> 01:31:43.588
So, um...

01:31:45.255 --> 01:31:46.255
How... how...

01:31:47.213 --> 01:31:49.005
Are... Are you... Are you okay?

01:31:50.213 --> 01:31:51.213
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:31:53.213 --> 01:31:54.380
Are <i>you </i> okay?

01:31:54.797 --> 01:31:55.797
Yeah.

01:31:56.922 --> 01:31:57.922
You know...

01:31:58.297 --> 01:32:00.880
- prison kind of changes you, but, uh...
- Mmm.

01:32:03.213 --> 01:32:04.255
I'm fine.

01:32:04.338 --> 01:32:08.213
I'm sorry, I just... I really don't know
what I'm doing with all that stuff yet.

01:32:08.297 --> 01:32:10.047
Well, for...

01:32:10.672 --> 01:32:13.088
someone who has no idea
what they're doing...

01:32:15.422 --> 01:32:17.005
you kind of know what you're doing.

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:21.380
That's a...

01:32:22.547 --> 01:32:23.380
Aah.

01:32:23.463 --> 01:32:25.255
Um, that's cool.

01:32:26.755 --> 01:32:28.005
So, how... Uh...

01:32:28.297 --> 01:32:30.630
How is your... How is...
How is your summer going?

01:32:31.838 --> 01:32:35.255
I mean, wh... what are you doing for...
for the summertime?

01:32:38.047 --> 01:32:40.047
I think I'm gonna backpack around
for a bit.

01:32:41.047 --> 01:32:42.172
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:32:42.255 --> 01:32:43.255
Where?

01:32:44.047 --> 01:32:47.005
I don't know. Honestly, anywhere
I can find a couch to crash on.

01:32:47.088 --> 01:32:49.880
I just... you know, I wanna see some stuff
before college.

01:32:50.588 --> 01:32:52.047
That's... that's really cool.

01:32:52.130 --> 01:32:54.588
Me too, that's...
that's why I'm taking a gap year.

01:32:55.088 --> 01:32:56.088
Yeah?

01:32:56.338 --> 01:32:57.338
Yeah.

01:32:57.422 --> 01:32:58.255
Yeah.

01:32:58.338 --> 01:32:59.588
All right, well...

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:01.088
have fun, nerd.

01:33:09.672 --> 01:33:13.047
Um, well, if... if you ever end up in...
in Botswana...

01:33:14.047 --> 01:33:16.005
you'd have a couch to crash on.

01:33:16.297 --> 01:33:17.463
Okay.

01:33:18.547 --> 01:33:22.213
Well, technically, it won't be my couch,
'cause I'll be staying with a family,

01:33:22.297 --> 01:33:24.505
- but I'm sure they'll be cool with it.
- Okay.

01:33:33.963 --> 01:33:34.963
Yes.

01:33:35.547 --> 01:33:36.547
Yes.

01:33:37.755 --> 01:33:38.922
Molly!

01:33:39.005 --> 01:33:41.463
Amy, this thing drives like a cruise ship.

01:33:42.213 --> 01:33:44.422
Well, it's yours now.

01:33:44.505 --> 01:33:45.880
Take care of the old Volvo for me.

01:33:45.963 --> 01:33:47.588
Oh, speaking of vulva,

01:33:47.672 --> 01:33:49.588
remember when you missed Hope's,

01:33:49.672 --> 01:33:51.547
and you just went straight
for that butt hole!

01:33:51.630 --> 01:33:53.630
I said... I said, "once a day."

01:33:53.713 --> 01:33:55.963
- Hey, I have to stock up.
- Once a day.

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:59.672
- You're gonna be on a flight for 28 hours.
- I said you could mention it once a day.

01:33:59.755 --> 01:34:00.939
- So I have to stock up.
- Aah!

01:34:00.963 --> 01:34:02.338
It's not my fault.

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:14.713
Yeah. It feels weird
to be on this side of the car.

01:34:14.797 --> 01:34:17.380
It's like everything's... different.

01:34:19.547 --> 01:34:21.755
Yeah, I can't believe
I'm not gonna see you tomorrow.

01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:24.463
Call me on that weird
international flip phone, okay?

01:34:24.547 --> 01:34:25.547
I will.

01:34:26.588 --> 01:34:27.588
Okay.

01:34:28.422 --> 01:34:29.630
- Bye. I love you.
- Bye.

01:34:29.713 --> 01:34:30.963
Love you.

01:34:32.422 --> 01:34:33.255
Bye.

01:34:33.338 --> 01:34:35.797
- Go make those tampons, girl.
- I will. I...

01:34:36.922 --> 01:34:38.505
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.213
Oh, gotta get that bag.

01:34:47.297 --> 01:34:50.297
Yep. Yeah, it's... it's a long trip.

01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:51.380
Go get 'em.

01:34:53.047 --> 01:34:54.047
What's a year?

01:34:55.755 --> 01:34:56.755
Okay.

01:35:45.755 --> 01:35:47.838
- Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!

01:35:47.922 --> 01:35:50.047
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:35:50.130 --> 01:35:52.672
I was going through a thing!

01:35:52.755 --> 01:35:53.898
- You weren't... You're...
- Aah!

01:35:53.922 --> 01:35:56.588
I was going through a whole fucking thing!

01:35:56.672 --> 01:35:57.713
What the fuck?

01:35:57.797 --> 01:36:00.422
- I can be the last one on the plane.
- What's wrong with you?

01:36:00.505 --> 01:36:01.505
You wanna get pancakes?

01:36:01.588 --> 01:36:04.047
Fuck, yeah, I do! Fuck, yeah!
