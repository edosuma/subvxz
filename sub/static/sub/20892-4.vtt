46:42.960 --> 46:44.080
For the past eight years,

46:44.160 --> 46:48.760
I've worked full-time
as an office manager in Bolthurst.

46:50.200 --> 46:54.640
Before that I was a stay-at-home mum,
which was nice.

Yesterday, my boss,

47:11.400 --> 47:13.880
who's been a good friend to me,

47:14.640 --> 47:17.120
found out that I took...

47:17.960 --> 47:19.960
I've been taking, as in, stealing

47:20.840 --> 47:22.320
from him and his company.

47:26.360 --> 47:30.840
£232,648 pounds is the total

47:30.920 --> 47:33.920
that I've taken from him.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.120
Stole from him.

47:46.600 --> 47:48.320
I used the money...

47:48.920 --> 47:50.440
The vast majority of it,

47:52.240 --> 47:53.640
I put into, erm,

47:55.120 --> 47:57.080
into machines in betting shops.

47:58.360 --> 48:00.640
Some of it was on online bingo

48:00.720 --> 48:06.040
but most of it, I'd say 200 grand,
it went into machines.

48:08.520 --> 48:13.160
I grew up, went to school,
went to college, got a job,

48:13.240 --> 48:17.080
got a house, had kids, got a dog.

48:20.320 --> 48:21.600

48:23.360 --> 48:28.440
I'm not anxious or depressed,
I don't drink or snort coke.

48:28.520 --> 48:30.040
And I'm not stupid.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.600
I'm not the cleverest person
in the world,

48:34.680 --> 48:37.960
but I have a "B" in O Level Maths

48:38.040 --> 48:43.480
and I know that the odds
of feeding a machine

48:44.160 --> 48:46.480
and coming out on top are very slim.

48:48.840 --> 48:50.240
But that is what I did.

48:52.320 --> 48:54.240
I just started and I couldn't stop.

If you'd had told me, 10 years ago,

48:59.600 --> 49:02.360
if you'd said
that I would wind up here,

49:02.440 --> 49:04.160
I would have laughed in your face.

49:08.280 --> 49:10.680
I suppose everybody has their thing.

49:13.960 --> 49:16.160
The thing that makes them
feel something,

49:18.520 --> 49:20.200
when they can't feel anything.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.280
Or when they want to disappear.

49:28.080 --> 49:31.120
And those machines, they were my thing.

49:31.920 --> 49:34.760
I cared more about them than anything.

49:36.720 --> 49:40.160
And if my boss, my friend,

49:42.040 --> 49:47.280
hadn't found out,
they would still be my thing.
