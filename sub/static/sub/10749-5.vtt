1x05 - The Haunting of Bill Crouse

00:34.686 --> 00:35.490
OK.

00:39.774 --> 00:40.853
Here we go.

00:42.313 --> 00:43.751
Sit properly?

00:45.751 --> 00:46.849
Cheers.

00:48.237 --> 00:49.178
Bill?

00:50.285 --> 00:51.492
Mick Hucknall.

00:56.606 --> 00:57.626
Hey, this is fun.

00:58.311 --> 01:01.176
- It's been a good night so far.
- Yes, it's been really good, yeah.

01:01.332 --> 01:03.356
Yeah, I'll be honest,
when Julie suggested

01:03.356 --> 01:04.864
we get together, I was like no.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.331
you know, I get set up a lot

01:06.484 --> 01:09.294
by friends, and it never works out.

01:09.439 --> 01:10.578
Tell me about it. Me too.

01:10.611 --> 01:12.582
You know, I hate dates usually.

01:12.729 --> 01:15.925
They should call dates
"Spend some time with a big fat loser!"

01:18.518 --> 01:19.886
But this has been brilliant.

01:20.004 --> 01:21.023
Hey...

01:21.200 --> 01:22.808
I was thinking, afterwards,

01:23.063 --> 01:24.308
maybe you'd like to

01:24.406 --> 01:25.641
come back to my place?

01:25.689 --> 01:27.642
We could listen to the new
Jamie Cullum album.

01:27.681 --> 01:28.837
Maybe, yeah!

01:28.945 --> 01:31.043
Yeah, yeah, that'd be...
really nice actually.

01:31.161 --> 01:32.190
Great.

01:33.935 --> 01:35.484
Let me guess...

01:35.778 --> 01:37.171
You're a...

01:37.376 --> 01:38.729
red wine person?

01:38.827 --> 01:40.033
Yes, yes I am!

01:40.837 --> 01:43.562
I would be too, if we could get
some service round here!

01:43.689 --> 01:44.866
Yeah, you, Hucknall.

01:45.863 --> 01:48.969
When you, when you Simply Ready?

01:49.933 --> 01:51.952
Unbelievable.

01:52.031 --> 01:53.501
Oh, I should say, um,

01:53.638 --> 01:55.050
I don't really like sharing.

01:55.297 --> 01:57.846
So you get what you want,
I'll get what I want

01:57.944 --> 02:00.865
we leave it at that.
I just think it's a lot less confusing.

02:01.090 --> 02:02.110
Sure, sure.

02:02.146 --> 02:03.571
- Did you say Jamie Cullum?
- Yeah.

02:03.594 --> 02:04.894
I hate Jamie Cullum.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.717
Oh, and, just to say,

02:08.773 --> 02:10.830
"I don't really like sharing."

02:11.204 --> 02:13.125
With the rising inflection
and everything.

02:13.263 --> 02:16.753
In a tapas restaurant,
he doesn't like sharing.

02:17.361 --> 02:18.694
What the heck is tapas?

02:18.812 --> 02:19.812
You know, tapas,

02:19.979 --> 02:22.097
- tiny food from Spain.
- Oh, yes.

02:22.214 --> 02:24.704
- Teipas.
- Yeah, that's no how you say it.

02:25.283 --> 02:26.400
Yes it is.

02:27.067 --> 02:28.479
You're a teipas.

02:29.557 --> 02:30.793
What else? What else?

02:30.920 --> 02:31.940
What else?

02:31.999 --> 02:34.097
Oh God, you should have seen him
with the waiters.

02:34.205 --> 02:35.666
- Rude?
- Unbelievable!

02:35.764 --> 02:37.606
Oh yeah, I used to work as a waiter.

02:37.665 --> 02:41.332
If anyone was ever rude to me, I used to
carry their food around in my trousers.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.622
Oh my God! Before you brought it
to their table?

02:45.779 --> 02:46.857
No, after.

02:47.838 --> 02:50.799
Of course before!
Why would I do it after?

02:50.984 --> 02:52.828
Do you think they did that to him?

02:53.024 --> 02:55.181
Okay, well. While he was eating,

02:55.298 --> 02:56.788
did you ear anyone laughing?

02:56.886 --> 02:58.768
Like... in the kitchen area.

02:59.710 --> 03:00.553
Yes!

03:00.621 --> 03:02.229
Yes I did, actually, yes I did.

03:02.327 --> 03:03.611
That'll be trouser food.

03:03.650 --> 03:04.895
- Oh God!
- Yeah.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.026
Probably a good thing
you weren't sharing.

03:07.190 --> 03:08.141
My God!

03:08.316 --> 03:09.728
I could have saved you the trouble.

03:10.022 --> 03:11.904
That guy is famous, he's a mouth.

03:11.924 --> 03:13.159
They call him "The News"

03:13.218 --> 03:15.424
because he was always talking about
who he slept with.

03:16.522 --> 03:19.483
I would honestly rather sleep
with a rat.

03:19.622 --> 03:20.609
Literally.

03:22.264 --> 03:24.343
The thing I cannot understand yet, this:

03:24.477 --> 03:27.110
this is a man Julie on 5th
thinks is perfect for me,

03:27.145 --> 03:28.307
I mean what was she thinking?

03:28.337 --> 03:29.186
Wait a second.

03:29.244 --> 03:30.752
- Who do you know on 5th?
- Why?

03:30.844 --> 03:32.611
What was the name,
was it Judy or Julie?

03:32.612 --> 03:33.720
Why do you need to know?

03:33.795 --> 03:34.731
No reason.

03:34.780 --> 03:36.597
Lots of nice looking girls on fifth.

03:36.915 --> 03:38.326
Looking for an in, aren't we?

03:38.345 --> 03:39.485
An in? No!

03:39.620 --> 03:40.722
Thank you, no.

03:40.741 --> 03:43.640
Don't use my name
to start leching around on 5th.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.799
For your information, I do not lech

03:46.963 --> 03:49.707
I have a little more class than that,
thank you very much.

03:50.006 --> 03:51.668
- Post.
- Thank you.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.234
Oh no, this is wrong.

03:53.388 --> 03:55.978
A lingerie catalogue
for a Cathy Morgan Foreman.

03:56.045 --> 03:57.664
I'll make sure that Cathy gets it.

03:58.354 --> 04:00.526
Cathy Morgan Foreman,
who is Cathy Morgan Foreman?

04:00.573 --> 04:02.316
Cathy works in...

04:02.335 --> 04:05.756
Cathy works
in the department of Shulupust.

04:05.968 --> 04:08.731
- Department of what?
- Oh excuse me, that's my phone ringing.

04:08.789 --> 04:10.953
- I didn't hear anything?
- It's on vibrate.

04:11.127 --> 04:12.054
Hello?

04:12.141 --> 04:13.358
Hello, Cathy!

04:13.416 --> 04:16.527
Yes, you parcel did arrive,
I'm keeping it here safe for you.

04:16.565 --> 04:18.623
No problem at all Cathy Morgan Foreman.

04:19.599 --> 04:21.019
If he comes by...

04:21.077 --> 04:22.352
Right. If who comes by?

04:24.106 --> 04:25.057
The News.

04:25.194 --> 04:26.120
Yes, right?

04:26.325 --> 04:27.318
If he calls,

04:27.361 --> 04:28.524
just tell him something.

04:29.099 --> 04:30.684
- Leave it with me!
- Great!

04:30.925 --> 04:33.050
Although I should just say
I'm not very good at lying.

04:33.128 --> 04:34.345
I'm very good at lying.

04:34.403 --> 04:36.103
I thought you were on the phone!

04:36.857 --> 04:37.958
Yeah, I am.

04:38.035 --> 04:39.871
Yes, that's fine.

04:43.432 --> 04:44.437
Hello?

04:44.572 --> 04:47.993
Listen Moss,
you're not going to Court, yeah?

04:48.341 --> 04:49.867
Just tell him something.

04:49.945 --> 04:52.776
It's just... I've never been very good
at judging the scale

04:52.872 --> 04:54.959
- of the lie...
- Yes, stop over thinking everything.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.878
- I couldnâ€™t do it when I was a child,
- You're getting yourself in a tease,

04:57.885 --> 04:58.932
I told a whopper and...

04:58.970 --> 05:00.209
Just tell him I'm busy!

05:02.765 --> 05:04.292
You're busy!

05:04.968 --> 05:06.456
That's brilliant!

05:08.281 --> 05:10.475
Just don't let him in here
under any circumstances.

05:10.842 --> 05:11.847
No!

05:11.924 --> 05:12.968
You're busy!

05:14.794 --> 05:17.016
Hey, um, what was the name of that girl,

05:17.132 --> 05:20.552
that Jen knows, was it Julie or Judy?

05:20.726 --> 05:22.195
Yes, one of those.

05:27.615 --> 05:30.301
Okay, I'm just going to go
for a letch on fifth.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.460
Yes.

05:31.808 --> 05:33.992
Look! I told you she's busy!

05:34.204 --> 05:37.528
Hey, back off, bastard!
This lady's busy!

05:37.673 --> 05:39.296
Too busy for you.

05:39.711 --> 05:40.813
Busy!

05:40.967 --> 05:42.107
Brilliant!

06:00.315 --> 06:01.977
- Hello?
- Hello!

06:03.378 --> 06:05.020
I'm just looking for Jen.

06:16.523 --> 06:18.649
I'm afraid Jen can't see you
at the moment.

06:18.721 --> 06:20.096
She's very busy.

06:20.342 --> 06:22.517
- Is she?
- She's a busy Miss Lizzy!

06:22.816 --> 06:23.895
Good bye!

06:27.146 --> 06:28.248
What is she doing?

06:28.364 --> 06:29.542
She's doing fine.

06:30.509 --> 06:32.383
Not how is she doing, what is she doing?

06:34.524 --> 06:35.947
- Is she in here?
- No.

06:35.954 --> 06:37.681
I won't keep her,
I want to give her these.

06:37.690 --> 06:39.230
- Don't give her.
- I'll give her these.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.805
- She won't like them.
- She won't mind!

06:40.809 --> 06:41.445
She will mind.

06:41.446 --> 06:43.194
It's not a problem.
I won't take any time.

06:43.222 --> 06:44.438
Look, why can't I go in?

06:44.480 --> 06:45.831
Because she's dead!

06:51.473 --> 06:52.401
What?

06:52.402 --> 06:55.164
Yeah, she's dead. She... she died.

06:56.459 --> 06:57.715
She died last night.

06:59.338 --> 07:00.749
She died?!

07:00.981 --> 07:01.908
Yeah!

07:02.101 --> 07:03.087
Completely.

07:05.038 --> 07:06.391
Oh God!

07:07.587 --> 07:08.650
Fuck!

07:08.727 --> 07:10.080
I just can't believe it!

07:10.157 --> 07:13.249
Well, I'd hardly make up
something like that, would I?

07:14.061 --> 07:16.070
No, no of course, of course not.

07:16.592 --> 07:18.080
Oh God!

07:19.116 --> 07:21.049
Well, she was a bit off
at the restaurant.

07:23.754 --> 07:24.778
I mean...

07:25.145 --> 07:26.150
Was it the food?

07:26.169 --> 07:28.063
- The tapas, do they know?
- Teipas!

07:28.111 --> 07:29.445
I don't know.

07:30.179 --> 07:31.687
Yes it was, why not.

07:34.574 --> 07:35.560
Oh Jesus!

07:36.405 --> 07:37.816
I know it's terrible, but,

07:38.163 --> 07:39.555
thank God, we weren't sharing.

07:42.666 --> 07:44.018
I just can't get over it.

07:44.192 --> 07:45.178
Yeah, well,

07:45.255 --> 07:47.285
we all have to go sometime.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.665
It's terrible, it's just terrible!

07:52.781 --> 07:54.520
It's bloody awful!

07:56.152 --> 07:57.640
She was so beautiful!

07:58.413 --> 08:00.017
She was some piece of ass.

08:05.762 --> 08:08.718
Anyhow, can't mourn
all the ruddy day, so...

08:14.414 --> 08:15.709
You know...

08:17.410 --> 08:19.844
I was the last person to sleep with her.

08:20.927 --> 08:23.342
- Really? She said that...
- What?

08:24.675 --> 08:29.989
She said she was looking forward to sleeping with you.

08:50.067 --> 08:52.386
I can't believe he lied like that.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.909
Doesn't he realise that lying
can lead to very serious ramifications?

09:02.605 --> 09:03.629
Hello?

09:07.700 --> 09:09.014
Hello!

09:13.381 --> 09:14.657
I'm Roy!

09:15.111 --> 09:16.328
I.T.

09:17.294 --> 09:20.965
My boss has assigned me to any work
you might want done...

09:21.361 --> 09:23.003
personally.

09:23.139 --> 09:24.627
personal... personally.

09:25.033 --> 09:27.178
Basically, if you want to

09:28.645 --> 09:29.887
just take my card.

09:32.258 --> 09:33.534
And...

09:35.028 --> 09:36.438
if you need anything done

09:36.921 --> 09:38.197
to your computer,

09:38.293 --> 09:42.834
just give me a buzz, on me phone.
It's my mobile phone, so

09:43.377 --> 09:46.022
you won't have to go through
all that call waiting...

09:46.147 --> 09:47.152
Lover.

09:47.345 --> 09:48.814
Okay, thank you, Roy.

09:48.939 --> 09:50.639
You're welcome, Judy.

09:51.277 --> 09:53.016
Oh, I'm not Judy, I'm Julie.

09:53.209 --> 09:54.446
Judy?

09:56.716 --> 09:58.513
Someone to see you!

09:59.981 --> 10:01.798
This man says you should take his card.

10:04.126 --> 10:06.367
<i>The girl from I.T., that's terrible.</i>

10:06.502 --> 10:08.493
I know, terrible, terrible thing.

10:09.169 --> 10:12.106
You know, I was actually the last person
to sleep with her.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.024
Very sudden, yes.

10:15.159 --> 10:16.975
I heard it was some bad tapas.

10:17.072 --> 10:18.076
Teipas.

10:18.173 --> 10:19.100
Yes.

10:19.351 --> 10:20.356
You must be stunned.

10:20.433 --> 10:21.670
I'm flabbergasted

10:21.728 --> 10:23.834
Well, you know where we are
if you need us.

10:24.008 --> 10:26.018
Sure, I'll be fine, thanks.

10:26.230 --> 10:28.337
Just sort of stay away
from this whole area,

10:28.471 --> 10:31.003
while we come to terms with the loss.

10:32.259 --> 10:34.674
Leave me now, I would be alone.

10:53.259 --> 10:54.303
Good lech?

10:54.998 --> 10:56.003
No!

10:56.128 --> 11:01.470
The girl, oh my God,
the girl, Judy, she's a...

11:02.301 --> 11:04.485
- Have you seen this girl?
- What's she like?

11:04.657 --> 11:07.748
- Well, she has hair on her eyes.
- Who has hair on her eyes?

11:07.845 --> 11:09.236
- Not you.
- No.

11:10.009 --> 11:12.096
I'm going for a coffee,
anyone wants anything?

11:12.279 --> 11:13.806
No? Okay, bye!

11:36.177 --> 11:38.013
- Hello?
- Hello?

11:39.935 --> 11:41.326
Hello Judy?

11:41.945 --> 11:43.375
What can I do for you?

11:43.394 --> 11:44.824
Computer is broken!

11:44.930 --> 11:47.037
Is it a PC or a Mac?

11:48.003 --> 11:49.008
<i>Yes!</i>

11:50.554 --> 11:52.157
Well, what's wrong with it?

11:52.235 --> 11:53.510
Broken down!

11:53.616 --> 11:55.780
Yeah, broken down how, Judy?

11:55.944 --> 11:58.272
- Big bang noise!
- Big bang noise, what...

11:58.485 --> 12:00.533
What's the precise nature
of the problem?

12:04.117 --> 12:05.045
MIO (My Input Output)

12:05.586 --> 12:07.963
Judy, the battery of my phone is...

12:12.310 --> 12:13.914
- Look at this.
- What?

12:14.069 --> 12:15.692
How nice is this?

12:16.812 --> 12:19.460
I just got a big load of flowers,

12:19.653 --> 12:21.179
and a big card!

12:21.295 --> 12:23.923
And everyone has signed it!

12:24.802 --> 12:26.735
"You will always be in our heart!"

12:27.362 --> 12:30.145
My God! And you said
they weren't nice here!

12:30.618 --> 12:31.449
Yeah.

12:32.917 --> 12:35.352
I don't understand
why they've done this?

12:35.921 --> 12:36.888
Why?

12:36.946 --> 12:38.356
I'll tell for why.

12:38.608 --> 12:40.946
It's because everyone thinks
you're brilliant!

12:41.931 --> 12:43.322
- Really?
- Yeah!

12:43.525 --> 12:45.669
And in fact, everyone thinks
you're so brilliant,

12:45.863 --> 12:48.240
they've just made you
Employee of the Month.

12:48.394 --> 12:49.495
- No?
- Yes!

12:49.611 --> 12:50.548
- No?
- Yes!

12:50.635 --> 12:51.746
- No!
- Yaha!

12:52.152 --> 12:53.524
I don't believe it!

12:53.717 --> 12:56.084
- Please believe it.
- Oh my God!

12:56.963 --> 13:00.567
I didn't even know they had
Employee of the Month here.

13:01.252 --> 13:03.880
No, they brought it in just for you.

13:04.779 --> 13:07.001
I'm gonna go up
and thank everybody right now.

13:07.117 --> 13:09.083
No! Don't do that!

13:09.192 --> 13:10.564
What? Why not?

13:10.718 --> 13:12.651
They'll be embarrassed.

13:12.892 --> 13:15.346
It's embarrassing being thanked.

13:16.274 --> 13:17.897
Don't be silly.

13:22.861 --> 13:25.354
Events seem to be taking
a downward turn.

13:29.586 --> 13:31.653
I told you, stop calling me at work!

13:43.978 --> 13:45.891
Nice and beautiful Jen!

13:45.968 --> 13:47.707
Hello, Small Pall!

13:48.344 --> 13:50.798
Didn't... Are you...
I thought you were sick or something.

13:50.895 --> 13:52.421
Sick? Me? No!

13:52.537 --> 13:55.223
I couldn't be better, I've just won
Employee of the Month.

13:55.436 --> 13:58.035
So, um, you're going my way?

14:02.311 --> 14:04.147
Don't you dare going too fast, no!

14:12.374 --> 14:13.476
Just...

14:13.630 --> 14:15.756
hard to get your head round, you know?

14:15.872 --> 14:17.360
One minute, she's there and

14:17.785 --> 14:19.331
next minute...

14:19.898 --> 14:20.717
just gone.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.046
You know,

14:22.722 --> 14:24.847
I was the last person
that slept with her actually.

14:26.856 --> 14:29.639
She held on so tightly,
you know, it was like...

14:30.509 --> 14:32.383
scary, but,

14:32.750 --> 14:35.252
sexy scary, you know, just like...

14:44.051 --> 14:45.355
Jen?!

14:45.935 --> 14:47.191
It was her!

14:49.007 --> 14:51.906
What are you still doing here Bill,
for God sake, go home!

14:52.959 --> 14:54.659
He was the last person
to sleep with her.

14:54.717 --> 14:57.925
I know... Apparently, she was
pretty hard stuff!

14:59.796 --> 15:01.413
Bye, Small Paul!

15:01.518 --> 15:03.644
Bye Jen, see you.

15:06.127 --> 15:07.711
Oh dear, oh Lord!

15:12.735 --> 15:14.609
At this dreadful hour

15:14.744 --> 15:17.972
we're all reminded how brief
our time is here on Earth.

15:18.107 --> 15:19.614
Sorry, who is it who died?

15:19.749 --> 15:20.928
I don't know.

15:21.275 --> 15:24.096
I believe Mr. Renholm has a few words.

15:29.152 --> 15:31.741
There's one more angel in Heaven.

15:33.442 --> 15:35.219
God, I miss Jen!

15:35.770 --> 15:38.630
She reminded me of me, at her age.

15:40.669 --> 15:42.427
I mean, when I was her age,

15:42.543 --> 15:44.783
she reminded me of her age.

15:47.683 --> 15:50.050
She reminded me of my age at her age.

15:53.050 --> 15:54.692
When I was her age,

15:55.485 --> 15:57.803
she was reminded of me?

16:00.304 --> 16:02.325
I truly liked Jen.

16:03.011 --> 16:06.084
And that en-likening of her
became a friendship.

16:06.644 --> 16:08.737
A friendship which ended so suddenly,

16:09.138 --> 16:10.827
just twelve hours ago...

16:11.716 --> 16:15.909
After... what I gather, was a rather
sensational evening with Bill Crouse!

16:16.044 --> 16:17.763
Bill, you dog!

16:19.116 --> 16:20.304
Where is he?

16:20.362 --> 16:21.869
Still cleaning himself off.

16:23.038 --> 16:24.738
She was special.

16:25.975 --> 16:27.212
So special in fact,

16:27.289 --> 16:30.168
that when I called
my close personal friend

16:30.438 --> 16:32.989
Elton John and told him about her,

16:33.269 --> 16:34.766
he dropped everything,

16:34.901 --> 16:37.433
and offered to come here
and perform for us!

16:37.529 --> 16:39.539
You heard me, he's in the building!

16:39.645 --> 16:42.543
Elton John is going to sing
a beautiful song

16:42.644 --> 16:43.896
about death.

16:56.701 --> 16:58.576
Oh my God, this is so...

16:59.136 --> 17:00.353
so lovely

17:01.638 --> 17:03.309
Thank you, so, so much!

17:03.957 --> 17:06.875
Tank you, thank you, oh God!

17:15.909 --> 17:18.112
Could I, say a few words?

17:18.479 --> 17:19.599
Oh my God!

17:22.701 --> 17:25.415
Thank you, so, so much!

17:26.092 --> 17:27.261
I would...

17:27.396 --> 17:29.446
I would not be standing up here today

17:29.467 --> 17:32.854
if it wasn't for so many things
but, not least,

17:34.420 --> 17:36.545
- Without him...
- Hey, she isn't dead!

17:36.642 --> 17:37.820
Yeah!

17:40.120 --> 17:41.975
You lying cow!

17:43.955 --> 17:45.424
We want Elton!

17:45.607 --> 17:50.399
We want Elton! We want Elton!
We want Elton!

17:53.404 --> 17:54.254
Okay!

17:54.350 --> 17:56.772
If that Judy woman comes down,
I don't work here,

17:56.807 --> 17:58.653
you've never seen me,
just make up something,

17:58.654 --> 17:59.496
just get rid of her!

17:59.531 --> 18:01.811
She's easy to spot,
she's has three rows of teeth.

18:01.965 --> 18:05.394
Listen, if I needed to get out of
the country, very, very cheaply,

18:05.568 --> 18:07.346
how would I go about doing that?

18:08.892 --> 18:09.819
Hey you!

18:13.452 --> 18:14.959
What did you say about me?

18:16.031 --> 18:17.442
Hello there, Jen!

18:17.731 --> 18:19.374
I would love to stay and chat,

18:19.509 --> 18:21.557
but, I've just received
a telephone call,

18:21.660 --> 18:24.079
saying that my father
has just killed someone.

18:25.816 --> 18:27.378
I need to attend to.

18:27.759 --> 18:29.403
Did you tell everyone I was dead?

18:36.523 --> 18:37.486
Maybe?

18:38.084 --> 18:39.176
Because, um,

18:39.258 --> 18:40.662
they all thought I was dead.

18:47.157 --> 18:49.164
- I know something.
- What? What do you know?

18:49.258 --> 18:51.747
Bill Crouse, he's saying
he slept with you last night.

18:51.817 --> 18:52.815
He's saying what?

18:52.903 --> 18:53.755
He think you're dead,

18:53.756 --> 18:55.662
so he's telling everybody
you slept with him.

18:55.745 --> 18:57.212
He's the one you should be angry at!

18:57.312 --> 18:59.390
Not me! I'm insignificant!

18:59.819 --> 19:00.922
Bastard!

19:08.056 --> 19:08.866
Voicemail!

19:11.660 --> 19:12.271
Hey!

19:12.870 --> 19:13.785
It's Jen!

19:13.996 --> 19:16.122
Stop telling everyone I slept with you!

19:16.491 --> 19:17.748
You bastard!

19:20.148 --> 19:21.393
Must have gone home.

19:22.343 --> 19:24.351
Oh God, my throat hurts.

19:25.791 --> 19:28.709
Well, it's probably all that shouting.

19:30.467 --> 19:32.149
I'm talking, aren't I?

19:33.482 --> 19:35.588
Can you get me his address?

19:36.129 --> 19:38.553
Yes, it might be a bit difficult.

19:38.602 --> 19:40.822
I have to hack into
his private company account,

19:40.823 --> 19:41.955
it might take some time.

19:43.104 --> 19:44.032
There we go.

19:47.343 --> 19:49.391
Oh, I really don't feel very well.

19:49.604 --> 19:51.633
Well, you look terrible.

19:53.507 --> 19:56.406
I'm still talking, aren't I?

20:05.446 --> 20:07.533
<i>You have one new message.</i>

20:07.726 --> 20:08.770
<i>Hey!</i>

20:09.001 --> 20:10.103
<i>It's Jen!</i>

20:10.335 --> 20:12.963
<i>Stop telling people I slept with you!</i>

20:13.137 --> 20:14.856
<i>You bastard!</i>

20:25.791 --> 20:27.511
Where Roy?

20:29.308 --> 20:30.583
Roy is dead!

20:44.674 --> 20:47.022
No, no! Don't breakdown!

20:47.138 --> 20:49.051
Don't break down, you bitch!

20:52.399 --> 20:55.665
Oh my God, oh my God!

20:58.602 --> 21:00.032
Bloody hell!

21:03.462 --> 21:06.744
Why you do that to me
when I need this chance?

21:06.745 --> 21:09.075
Oh for God's sake!
Now my car is bloody open

21:09.076 --> 21:10.732
and I don't know what it means!

21:13.624 --> 21:18.706
Come on, come on Ritchley...
Street, Ritchley Street.

21:21.266 --> 21:24.841
My God, okay, I'm... Right.

21:28.393 --> 21:30.248
Probably guys, probably guys,

21:30.325 --> 21:32.335
leaving message, funny message,

21:32.470 --> 21:36.470
probably, Bob,
it's Bob leaving funny messages.

21:36.586 --> 21:39.117
And the, the floating head.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.851
It's all stress,

21:44.063 --> 21:47.636
a bit stress is all and...
just fun and games.

21:54.503 --> 21:55.991
Oh God!

22:01.772 --> 22:03.550
Oh God!

22:03.812 --> 22:07.051
Let me in! Let me in Bill!

22:07.115 --> 22:07.946
No!

22:08.120 --> 22:11.270
It's raining! Please, let me in!

22:11.366 --> 22:13.125
No, you're never coming in!

22:13.240 --> 22:16.641
Stop telling people I slept with you!

22:16.727 --> 22:18.698
I will! I will! I'm sorry!

22:18.862 --> 22:20.176
Bastard!

22:20.939 --> 22:23.412
You bastard!

22:24.082 --> 22:25.789
Oh no! I'm sorry!

22:25.925 --> 22:28.446
You bastard!

22:44.769 --> 22:49.131
<i>Small Paul, you're gone now.</i>

22:49.211 --> 22:53.233
<i>You pushed that trolley
a little too hard,</i>

22:53.338 --> 22:58.564
<i>You felt a twinge,
it was your heart and you're dead now...</i>

23:01.072 --> 23:05.468
<i>And now you're running four feet
in heaven...</i>

23:06.107 --> 23:08.426
- Did you know him? - No.

23:13.319 --> 23:15.425
I don't think that's Elton John.
