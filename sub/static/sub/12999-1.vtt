03:54.586 --> 03:56.241
Stupid.

03:58.605 --> 04:00.362
Go kill something.

06:00.603 --> 06:02.533
Can I help you, miss?

06:02.629 --> 06:06.028
- I'm waiting for the sheriff.
- I'm the sheriff. Name's Windgate.

06:07.122 --> 06:10.761
- You're not wearing a uniform.
- I rarely do.

06:12.651 --> 06:14.028
Then how do I know you're the sheriff?

06:14.124 --> 06:17.452
Well, I don't know what to tell you, miss,
you can wait out here as long as you like.

06:17.547 --> 06:19.796
Maybe another sheriff'll come along.

06:23.435 --> 06:25.133
Wait. Wait!

06:31.083 --> 06:32.476
What you got there?

06:32.811 --> 06:36.179
My mother's cat. Mine, since she passed.

06:41.051 --> 06:43.763
Oh, my God. What happened?

06:44.444 --> 06:47.087
- He cut her head off.
- Who?

06:47.183 --> 06:52.030
This guy. Blackway.
I don't... I don't know his first name.

06:53.468 --> 06:55.036
Richard.

06:55.132 --> 06:58.956
- You know him?
- Oh, yeah, most around here do.

07:00.794 --> 07:05.308
- I'm surprised you don't, actually.
- I'm not... from here, originally.

07:05.404 --> 07:09.308
I mean, I was born here,
but... that was a while ago.

07:09.404 --> 07:12.092
So, what brings you back here?

07:12.571 --> 07:16.604
- My mother died in June.
- You're Betsy Warren's daughter.

07:17.467 --> 07:20.578
My condolences. She was a fine lady.

07:22.683 --> 07:26.781
So... how long's Richard Blackway
been bothering you?

07:26.876 --> 07:30.142
I think this goes
way beyond "bothering me."

07:30.684 --> 07:32.412
Harassing.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.732
He attacked me.

07:34.828 --> 07:36.940
- When was this?
- Last week, after work.

07:37.036 --> 07:39.436
- Where?
- Sullivan's.

07:39.532 --> 07:43.005
- I waitress there a couple of nights a week.
- Why didn't you report it then?

07:43.100 --> 07:46.604
I didn't think that I was ever gonna see him
again. I thought he was just passing through.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.412
But now he's everywhere I go.
The grocery store, the gas station...

07:50.508 --> 07:54.300
Well... it's a small town.
You run into the same people.

07:54.396 --> 07:57.500
No, no. He's following me.

07:57.596 --> 07:59.676
- Well...
- Watching me.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.246
'Fraid there's not much I can do for you.

08:01.341 --> 08:03.883
If you'd come in, last week,
after the alleged assault...

08:03.979 --> 08:05.746
"Alleged"?

08:07.194 --> 08:09.123
There were witnesses.

08:11.131 --> 08:12.670
Let me ask you something.

08:14.364 --> 08:17.851
- Did your mother leave you the house?
- Yes.

08:17.947 --> 08:21.631
Well, my advice is, you unload it
for whatever you can get for it,

08:21.727 --> 08:24.764
and catch a bus back to wherever it was
you were living before Betsy passed.

08:24.860 --> 08:28.700
Can't you do something?
Call him in for questioning or something?

08:28.796 --> 08:32.828
I... just get him to leave me alone.
Give me a restraining order, something.

08:32.924 --> 08:35.856
It's just not the way
it works around here.

08:38.043 --> 08:40.091
How do things work around here?

08:40.187 --> 08:44.453
You sit on your asses until he breaks into
my house and does God knows what to me?

08:49.307 --> 08:52.284
Fuck it, whatever,
I don't even know why I bothered.

08:52.380 --> 08:54.371
Miss Warren.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.268
You know the saw mill,
the other side of town?

08:58.364 --> 09:00.633
Big place, by the side of the road.

09:00.729 --> 09:02.907
Maple Lake Timber.

09:03.003 --> 09:06.556
You might try going out there,
and see if Scotty's around.

09:06.652 --> 09:08.444
And he can get Blackwell
to leave me alone?

09:08.539 --> 09:11.489
- Well, he will if Whizzer asks him.
- Who's Whizzer?

09:11.585 --> 09:14.907
Whizzer's the boss, he... he runs the place.

09:15.003 --> 09:17.468
You go see him, go see Whizzer.

09:17.564 --> 09:19.740
Oh, and if you want,
you can leave your cat with me,

09:19.836 --> 09:23.490
- I'll make sure she gets cremated.
- No, I got it.

10:07.835 --> 10:10.370
- 'Night, Lillian.
- Fuck you!

10:12.124 --> 10:14.535
You say "fuck you" again...

10:14.870 --> 10:19.138
one of these nights, I just might.

11:16.699 --> 11:19.932
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- Get down, get down.

11:20.028 --> 11:22.738
- I can't hear you. What?
- Get down here.

11:26.315 --> 11:29.106
- Want to get a coffee?
- Get out of here, go on.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.735
Lonely old timers took me out back
to the log bunkhouse,

11:34.830 --> 11:38.367
to show me a big douglas fir
they'd left standing.

11:38.463 --> 11:41.148
And I'm not just talking
about an ordinary pine,

11:41.244 --> 11:43.747
I'm talking... this one was special.

11:44.347 --> 11:49.420
It's what old wood choppers
used to call a "wood's wife."

11:51.243 --> 11:56.815
Had a knothole in the trunk,
about yea high.

11:57.054 --> 12:00.908
And what you did, the mood strikes you,

12:01.004 --> 12:04.859
you got yourself a hand full
of lard for the kitchen.

12:05.361 --> 12:09.697
And you greased up
that knothole real good.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.771
And...

12:11.867 --> 12:13.532
then...

12:15.067 --> 12:16.766
well...

12:19.531 --> 12:22.933
- You're shitting me.
- God's truest.

12:24.122 --> 12:26.588
What do you think goes on up there?

12:26.684 --> 12:30.380
50 loggers stuck up there in the woods,
all winter? No women?

12:31.474 --> 12:34.690
There's just so much checkers
a man can play.

12:35.738 --> 12:38.212
I'll be damned.

12:39.099 --> 12:41.986
Some folks call 'em "pussy pines."

12:43.386 --> 12:45.627
You screwed a tree?

12:46.230 --> 12:49.447
Still picking the splinters out.

13:00.539 --> 13:02.780
Hey, what's up?

13:03.068 --> 13:06.015
- Lady in a little car.
- Recognize her?

13:06.111 --> 13:09.500
Yeah, I seen her waitressin'
over at Sullivan's.

13:09.596 --> 13:12.609
Helps out with the kids
at the elementary school, too.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.243
Which one of you is Whizzer?

13:17.339 --> 13:20.764
- Help you?
- Guy named Scotty work for you?

13:20.860 --> 13:22.973
- Who told you that?
- The sheriff.

13:23.069 --> 13:26.235
- Scotty ain't here.
- He's upstate, went to White River.

13:26.331 --> 13:29.659
- He got a brother up that way.
- Ain't his brother, it's his uncle.

13:29.755 --> 13:32.156
It's his brother,
I played pool with the guy.

13:32.891 --> 13:35.036
What do you want with Scotty?

13:35.131 --> 13:37.564
This guy's been bothering me.

13:37.660 --> 13:41.500
He killed my cat.
He trashed my fucking car.

13:41.595 --> 13:45.116
I need someone to help me... talk to him?

13:45.212 --> 13:48.444
I don't know, threaten him,
if that's what it takes.

13:48.540 --> 13:50.287
The name's Blackway.

13:52.571 --> 13:56.060
You tell Sheriff Windgate
about Blackway bothering you?

13:56.156 --> 13:59.964
He said there's nothing he can do.
He said to come here, and ask for Scotty.

14:00.060 --> 14:03.260
- He said Scotty would know what to do.
- He'd say, "get another cat."

14:03.356 --> 14:05.564
- There you go.
- Or leave town.

14:05.660 --> 14:07.842
I am not leaving.

14:08.410 --> 14:12.060
- Why not?
- Because this is where I live now.

14:12.156 --> 14:16.220
A pretty girl like you could live plenty
of places. Where were you before this?

14:16.316 --> 14:19.100
- Seattle.
- Seattle's nice, go back.

14:19.196 --> 14:22.475
- You know where else is real nice?
- Portland.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.927
What is wrong with you people?

14:26.780 --> 14:28.923
I grew up here.

14:29.019 --> 14:31.515
This property's all I got,
and I put a lot of work into it.

14:31.611 --> 14:34.844
I will be damned if some asshole
is gonna run me out of town.

14:34.940 --> 14:37.244
So I will ask you one more time.

14:38.203 --> 14:40.450
How do I find Scotty?

14:41.402 --> 14:44.956
I'm sorry, miss, Scotty's not here,
and I can't help you.

14:50.107 --> 14:51.671
Pathetic.

15:07.611 --> 15:09.179
Fuck!

15:09.826 --> 15:11.778
Damn it!

15:16.059 --> 15:20.286
Anybody wants to go with her,
I'll pay ya a week's wages and...

15:21.082 --> 15:22.981
cover your funeral expenses.

15:24.411 --> 15:27.458
Yeah, I'll do it. I'll go with her.

15:29.146 --> 15:32.418
- What's that, Les?
- I said, "I'll go with her."

15:34.139 --> 15:36.460
You gonna go find Blackway?

15:36.556 --> 15:38.329
Sure, why not?

15:39.547 --> 15:43.771
You're not... seriously thinking
of taking on Blackway by yourself?

15:43.867 --> 15:46.754
No, I'll take Nate with me.

15:48.314 --> 15:51.420
- You think he's up to it?
- I can ask him.

15:51.516 --> 15:53.122
Nate?

15:53.466 --> 15:56.236
What do you say, Nate, you wanna go with Les?

15:56.476 --> 15:58.399
I don't mind.

16:00.026 --> 16:02.479
You know who Blackway is, don't you?

16:03.419 --> 16:05.468
I seen him.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.708
Think you'll be up for it?

16:08.763 --> 16:10.395
I guess.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.764
He's kinda old, ain't he?

16:12.860 --> 16:15.118
Yeah, like me.

16:20.858 --> 16:23.937
- You sure about this, Les?
- Yeah.

16:25.275 --> 16:28.348
This ain't your fight,
you didn't go askin' for this.

16:28.443 --> 16:32.247
- No, she didn't either, did she?
- Maybe so. But...

16:32.857 --> 16:36.075
sure as hell would be better
for everyone involved if...

16:36.727 --> 16:39.067
she just left town.

16:39.163 --> 16:40.770
Yeah.

16:43.675 --> 16:45.218
Well...

16:47.322 --> 16:50.171
Okay, I'm leaving this here.

16:50.267 --> 16:54.108
Don't you touch it with that thing
on your lip. Come on, let's go. Come on.

17:05.755 --> 17:09.442
- Hey. Trouble?
- Damn thing won't start.

17:10.555 --> 17:13.154
I'm not surprised,
your battery's screwed up.

17:14.843 --> 17:17.084
Terminal's corroded.

17:17.180 --> 17:19.464
Useless. Okay, we'll...

17:20.136 --> 17:24.219
- use Nate's truck, okay?
- For what?

17:24.315 --> 17:27.276
What do you think? To find your friend
Blackway, isn't that what you want?

17:27.372 --> 17:30.908
Scotty's not gonna help you, he's as
scared of Blackway as everyone else is.

17:31.004 --> 17:33.346
My name is Lester, by the way.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.410
That's Nate.

17:38.714 --> 17:40.764
He's like 100 years old.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.395
Close.

17:42.491 --> 17:46.203
Shit. You don't have any friends
who could help me?

17:46.299 --> 17:48.507
- Pickup only seats three.
- Give me the keys.

17:48.603 --> 17:51.286
- It's my truck.
- Give me the keys. Get in the truck.

17:51.382 --> 17:53.467
You think Whizzer's serious
about paying us a week's wages...

17:53.563 --> 17:54.875
- No.
- I can pay you.

17:54.971 --> 17:56.353
- Yeah?
- I've got some money from my mom's...

17:56.449 --> 17:58.565
We don't need your money. Get in.

17:58.796 --> 18:01.785
- We don't want her money?
- No, we don't. Get in.

18:06.075 --> 18:07.682
Okay.

18:13.082 --> 18:16.123
Girl is a piece of work, ain't she?
Callin' us pathetic.

18:16.219 --> 18:19.676
I'll tell you who's a piece of work.
Windgate.

18:20.155 --> 18:24.059
Sending her to us because
he's too chicken shit to do his job.

18:24.778 --> 18:26.300
Yeah.

18:26.396 --> 18:30.236
He's still thanking his lucky stars
Blackway got bored of being a deputy.

18:30.332 --> 18:33.468
- Moved onto bigger things.
- Badder things.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.578
I don't know what Les is thinking.

18:38.394 --> 18:40.315
I'll tell ya.

18:40.603 --> 18:44.363
He's thinking, he sees a young girl
in trouble and needs help.

18:44.763 --> 18:47.293
Could be any one of our daughters.

18:49.115 --> 18:52.603
- Nate didn't seem to scared by Blackway.
- He don't know better.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.844
What about Lester?

18:56.234 --> 18:58.867
Lester's scared of Blackway, all right.

19:01.178 --> 19:03.314
If he ain't...

19:04.886 --> 19:06.830
he should be.

19:32.378 --> 19:35.899
- Okay, quick stop for supplies.
- Can I use your bathroom?

19:35.995 --> 19:38.075
- Want to take a bath?
- No.

19:38.171 --> 19:39.804
- You want the can?
- Yeah.

19:39.899 --> 19:42.306
Then say so. Inside.

19:43.418 --> 19:48.155
- What's all this stuff?
- Whirligigs. He makes them.

19:48.251 --> 19:51.131
His wife used to sell them.

19:51.227 --> 19:54.779
Don't know why he still makes them.
She's long gone.

19:54.875 --> 19:58.235
- She died?
- She left.

19:58.331 --> 20:01.627
Ran off with the dentist.

20:01.723 --> 20:03.969
That's what I hear, anyway.

20:10.330 --> 20:13.147
Les lets me crash here
when my mom and I aren't getting along.

20:13.243 --> 20:15.228
Oh, yeah?

20:15.995 --> 20:19.164
- Where is the bathroom?
- Up the stairs.

20:19.259 --> 20:22.690
You gotta jiggle the handle
after you flush.

21:07.002 --> 21:10.620
- You go to Mckinley?
- Nah, I was home schooled.

21:11.099 --> 21:13.211
Don't play well with others?

21:13.787 --> 21:15.906
Mom's real religious.

21:23.546 --> 21:25.640
What happened to his daughter?

21:26.331 --> 21:28.352
Killed herself.

21:29.755 --> 21:33.218
Overdosed or something.

21:33.914 --> 21:36.034
He never talks about her.

21:44.282 --> 21:47.193
- What's that?
- Curtain rods.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.467
Bullshit.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.032
I don't want guns in this.

21:52.443 --> 21:55.714
How do you think we're gonna
get Blackway to leave you alone?

21:57.450 --> 21:58.891
I don't know, I haven't gotten that far.

21:58.987 --> 22:02.065
Gonna reason with him?
Do you think he's a reasonable man?

22:03.274 --> 22:05.221
If you don't want to do it,
if you don't want to go through with this,

22:05.317 --> 22:08.875
say the word now,
I'll drop you at the bus station, and...

22:08.971 --> 22:11.179
get the next bus out of town.

22:11.275 --> 22:14.379
We threaten him with that?
And he'll leave me alone?

22:14.475 --> 22:16.427
I don't know.

22:16.523 --> 22:19.410
Your guess is as good as mine, kiddo.

22:20.554 --> 22:22.481
Better know how to use it.

22:23.883 --> 22:26.066
Fasten your seatbelt.

22:34.250 --> 22:36.500
- Afternoon, ladies.
- Scotty!

22:36.596 --> 22:38.699
- Hey, just been talking about you, Scott.
- Oh, yeah?

22:38.795 --> 22:42.379
Yeah. Girl come in here
this morning looking for you.

22:42.475 --> 22:45.611
- Blackway's been following her.
- Bashed in her window.

22:45.707 --> 22:47.825
Killed her cat.

22:51.721 --> 22:56.027
- What's that gotta do with me?
- Windgate sent her to find you, he...

22:56.123 --> 22:59.008
said you... you'd had dealings
with Blackway in the past,

22:59.104 --> 23:02.194
and might be able to help her out.

23:02.986 --> 23:04.593
Why?

23:05.482 --> 23:09.439
Might have figured
you'd want to even the score.

23:10.155 --> 23:13.931
Yeah, how many other ones you went
against him, that time at the fort?

23:14.507 --> 23:17.036
I seem to recall it being three.

23:17.515 --> 23:19.321
I don't remember.

23:25.386 --> 23:27.249
Made my peace with Blackway.

23:30.218 --> 23:32.240
I've got no score to settle.

23:40.714 --> 23:43.311
You got anything else to say, Scotty?

23:44.299 --> 23:46.450
I didn't think so.

23:54.761 --> 23:56.300
Fitz.

23:57.067 --> 23:58.605
Fitz.

24:00.332 --> 24:02.173
Hey, Fitz.

24:02.825 --> 24:04.722
It's Les.

24:08.651 --> 24:10.929
Fitz, come on, open up.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.115
- Can we talk?
- Shut up.

24:15.211 --> 24:17.420
We're looking for Blackway.

24:17.516 --> 24:18.507
Why?

24:18.603 --> 24:21.137
Well, we'll just looking for him,
that's why.

24:24.777 --> 24:26.764
He was here.

24:27.627 --> 24:30.636
This was... my uncle Joe's.

24:31.499 --> 24:34.092
- You remember him?
- No.

24:35.147 --> 24:37.611
He's been dead 20 years.

24:37.899 --> 24:40.139
I'm not sure if it even fires anymore.

24:41.642 --> 24:43.323
What happened with Blackway?

24:49.034 --> 24:51.980
What happened with Blackway, Fitz?

24:56.522 --> 24:58.635
It was a business thing.

24:59.403 --> 25:01.514
Blackway came in with a job.

25:01.610 --> 25:05.516
A piece of land,
over near the Key Mountain.

25:05.612 --> 25:10.123
Woman lives in Portland.
Blackway's got his side contract.

25:10.219 --> 25:14.412
So many feet, downs, roads,
you know how it works.

25:14.891 --> 25:16.459
Looks okay.

25:16.555 --> 25:20.491
So, we give Blackway his broker's fee,
and away we go.

25:20.587 --> 25:23.083
Shut the fuck up!

25:23.179 --> 25:24.720
Hey.

25:27.306 --> 25:29.292
Sorry.

25:30.299 --> 25:32.293
Not even my dog.

25:38.458 --> 25:41.403
Anyway, we were in there,
the house, six weeks.

25:43.992 --> 25:46.433
One day, I get a call from the job boss.

25:47.066 --> 25:49.532
Seems he's had a visit from the owner.

25:49.915 --> 25:52.156
And the sheriff's deputy.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.747
The owner was pissed.

25:55.226 --> 25:59.418
He doesn't know anything
about any logging jobs.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.403
He doesn't know anything about contracts.

26:01.499 --> 26:07.078
What he does know, is that he's
got about 40 acres less woods.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.340
Than he thought he had.

26:10.682 --> 26:12.301
I...

26:13.507 --> 26:16.518
Blackway forged
the owner's signature, right?

26:16.614 --> 26:17.995
Yep.

26:18.091 --> 26:22.139
Says, I'm gonna be hearing
from his lawyer.

26:22.235 --> 26:24.419
I expect I will.

26:27.130 --> 26:29.243
It was Monday.

26:29.339 --> 26:31.803
The next day, I was gonna see the sheriff.

26:32.475 --> 26:34.658
Tell him about Blackway.

26:47.578 --> 26:49.333
That night...

26:50.361 --> 26:53.178
Cynthia and I, are in bed...

26:53.274 --> 26:55.211
sound asleep...

26:55.306 --> 26:57.292
I wake up.

26:57.787 --> 27:00.059
For a minute, I don't know why.

27:01.113 --> 27:03.104
Then I do.

27:06.842 --> 27:10.273
Somebody's sittin' there. By our bed.

27:11.290 --> 27:13.660
<i>Just sitting there in the dark.</i>

27:14.139 --> 27:16.761
- <i>Got our little girl.</i>
- Heidi.

27:17.106 --> 27:20.195
I reached for the light.
"Leave it," he says.

27:21.786 --> 27:25.281
It's Blackway. And Cynthia, she's up.

27:25.377 --> 27:28.731
- Who is it? Who's there?
- He says, "shush her."

27:29.450 --> 27:31.435
<i>Blackway, he doesn't
pay her any attention.</i>

27:31.531 --> 27:33.378
Hey, Fitz.

27:34.682 --> 27:39.379
<i>Heard you were thinking of talking to
the sheriff about that situation at McKay.</i>

27:40.027 --> 27:41.747
Maybe.

27:54.105 --> 27:55.766
Maybe?

27:56.987 --> 27:59.198
Why would you do that?

28:00.699 --> 28:03.408
Haven't we made a lot
of money together, Fitz?

28:05.275 --> 28:07.089
Haven't we?

28:13.802 --> 28:16.643
<i>I put a lot of people
to work in this town.</i>

28:19.833 --> 28:21.838
Don't disappoint me, Fitz.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.085
I have to come back here again...

28:25.339 --> 28:27.974
<i>you're never gonna see her again.</i>

28:38.042 --> 28:41.272
Well, he gets up...

28:41.744 --> 28:43.707
he's gone.

28:47.034 --> 28:49.218
So, you didn't go to the sheriff, then?

28:50.922 --> 28:52.647
He's serious.

28:54.441 --> 28:57.545
You know where Blackway is,
Mr. Fitzgerald?

28:58.554 --> 29:00.091
No.

29:00.571 --> 29:01.626
Why?

29:01.722 --> 29:05.951
He's been causing trouble
for the... girl here.

29:06.394 --> 29:08.603
Where would you go to find him?

29:09.541 --> 29:11.553
No place.

29:12.298 --> 29:14.002
I'm sorry.

29:15.834 --> 29:19.701
I know Heidi.
I substitute at her school sometimes.

29:21.018 --> 29:24.245
- You know my daughter?
- She's a real nice girl.

29:25.578 --> 29:27.116
My name's Lillian.

29:28.411 --> 29:30.882
She's mentioned you.

29:36.474 --> 29:38.146
Yeah.

29:44.026 --> 29:46.907
You might want to try Diamond Mountain.

29:47.002 --> 29:50.555
There's a logging crew
getting finished up.

29:51.034 --> 29:53.851
If Blackway's not there,
don't know where he is.

29:53.947 --> 29:55.548
Okay.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.465
Thanks a bunch.

30:38.873 --> 30:40.449
You see him?

30:40.954 --> 30:43.074
No, not yet.

30:43.833 --> 30:46.010
Nate, go out, and...

30:46.106 --> 30:48.507
ask if they've seen him.

30:48.603 --> 30:50.177
Sure.

31:08.890 --> 31:10.625
Help you?

31:19.194 --> 31:20.929
I'm looking for Blackway.

31:22.426 --> 31:24.001
Why?

31:26.185 --> 31:29.040
- I need to see him.
- He ain't here.

31:31.737 --> 31:33.729
Who are they?

31:35.898 --> 31:38.177
They're looking for Blackway, too.

31:41.178 --> 31:43.105
Hey, good morning.

31:43.642 --> 31:46.427
- How you doing?
- What's that you got there?

31:46.523 --> 31:49.243
- Curtain rods.
- Bullshit, curtain rods.

31:49.339 --> 31:51.713
Well, you'll never know, will you?

31:52.505 --> 31:54.913
Has Blackway been here this morning?

31:57.049 --> 32:01.179
He was here. Might be, he's gone
to the fort to check in with Murdoch.

32:01.275 --> 32:04.538
- Why don't you shut up?
- Why don't you?

32:04.634 --> 32:08.033
Blackway never said nothing
about telling nobody where he was.

32:10.106 --> 32:12.058
Thanks, I'm much obliged.

32:12.154 --> 32:15.419
Go back to work now. Go on.

32:15.515 --> 32:17.250
Thank you.

32:18.329 --> 32:20.762
When you find Blackway
you're gonna wish you hadn't.

32:20.858 --> 32:24.226
Whatever you say, pal. Whatever you say.

32:32.761 --> 32:35.579
Did you see that dog?

32:36.058 --> 32:38.299
Yeah, he was big.

32:38.394 --> 32:40.962
Didn't know whether
to ride him or milk him.

32:43.289 --> 32:45.666
You want to milk him, you're on your own.

32:48.410 --> 32:50.656
Sure as hell looks like a gun.

32:51.866 --> 32:53.634
You tricked him.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.773
She doesn't like tricks.

33:00.249 --> 33:02.779
I guess she prefers fights.

33:03.450 --> 33:05.890
Yeah, like my ex-wife.

33:13.145 --> 33:15.547
That's not gonna scare Blackway.

33:15.643 --> 33:19.122
You never know. You never know.

33:37.785 --> 33:39.770
I don't see his truck anywhere.

33:39.866 --> 33:44.507
See the Harley at the door, there?
That belongs to his bookkeeper, Murdoch.

33:44.890 --> 33:47.169
Okay, let's go and see what's inside.

33:51.609 --> 33:53.853
I'll pay you back on Friday.

33:55.579 --> 33:57.210
Hey.

33:57.306 --> 33:59.489
Got you a beer.

34:01.497 --> 34:04.379
- I know you?
- I'm your new parole officer.

34:05.098 --> 34:07.249
The fuck you are.

34:11.864 --> 34:15.425
- What do you want?
- Looking for Blackway.

34:16.248 --> 34:18.681
- "Blackway."
- Yeah.

34:18.777 --> 34:19.739
Who's "Blackway"?

34:19.835 --> 34:22.106
He's been kind of messing with that
young lady over there, you know,

34:22.202 --> 34:25.793
giving her trouble, and I thought perhaps,
you could help me find him, you know.

34:28.762 --> 34:32.667
You really think this old fuck and his
boyfriend are gonna be able to help you?

34:32.763 --> 34:35.228
- Don't call me that.
- Nate, lighten the fuck up.

34:35.324 --> 34:38.273
We're just having a friendly talk here,
what's the matter with you?

34:46.009 --> 34:49.369
You know, my advice to you, sweetie, is...

34:49.465 --> 34:51.766
do whatever you can...

34:51.862 --> 34:53.626
you know, for Blackway.

34:55.129 --> 34:57.307
You know what I mean?

34:57.402 --> 35:00.282
Yeah, maybe... maybe get on your knees?

35:00.378 --> 35:02.202
Appeal to his better nature?

35:02.298 --> 35:06.193
You say that again,
you're gonna need a doctor.

35:11.768 --> 35:15.261
I'm gonna... I'm gonna need a doctor?

35:16.987 --> 35:18.625
Nate.

35:19.801 --> 35:21.799
Son of a bitch!

35:53.049 --> 35:55.932
Hey, boss! Knife!

37:04.283 --> 37:06.363
- Leave him alone.
- He's hurt.

37:06.459 --> 37:08.346
- It's his fault.
- Why is it my fault?

37:08.442 --> 37:10.586
- Just is, that's why.
- He started it.

37:10.682 --> 37:13.626
- He didn't, you started it.
- Stop the car.

37:13.722 --> 37:15.930
- Gonna throw up or something?
- No, I just need to get out.

37:16.026 --> 37:17.850
What's your problem?

37:17.946 --> 37:20.826
This is my fight, okay?
Not yours, hear me?

37:20.922 --> 37:23.680
Well, it seems to be ours, now, doesn't it?

37:31.705 --> 37:33.952
Why are you doing this?

37:34.857 --> 37:36.977
Needs to be done.

37:38.809 --> 37:41.153
Needs to be done.

38:11.418 --> 38:13.753
- Hey, Sam, how are you?
- Hey, guys.

38:13.849 --> 38:17.972
- How's it going, man?
- Good. Hey, Dottie, beautiful.

38:18.490 --> 38:20.673
- Where do you want us to sit?
- You can go to hell.

38:20.769 --> 38:23.706
- Your friends can sit wherever they like.
- Okay, thanks.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.434
You want your coffee?

38:25.530 --> 38:28.352
Yeah, some water for my pill.

38:32.888 --> 38:34.879
What's that for?

38:35.258 --> 38:38.682
- Your heart?
- No, down below.

38:39.401 --> 38:40.826
Viagra?

38:40.922 --> 38:43.745
- No.
- It helps him piss.

38:45.401 --> 38:48.873
- You have to take a pill to piss?
- No, I have one stop pissing.

38:48.969 --> 38:50.858
Here's some water.

38:50.954 --> 38:54.736
- Thanks.
- Okay. Okay.

38:55.145 --> 38:57.994
- Just coffee, thanks.
- Omelette and toast for her.

38:58.090 --> 38:59.851
- Okay.
- But I'm not hungry.

38:59.947 --> 39:02.378
Gotta eat, shut up.
An omelette and toast and...

39:02.474 --> 39:06.601
Can I get a hamburger, a Philly cheese steak,
and a side of onion rings?

39:06.697 --> 39:09.312
- What's your soup of the day?
- Give him the same as her.

39:10.538 --> 39:12.778
Okay. Thank you.

39:12.873 --> 39:14.992
Cover your face.

39:20.936 --> 39:23.088
Back in a minute.

39:33.128 --> 39:35.242
- Les.
- Hi, Chris, how are you doing?

39:35.338 --> 39:36.969
I'm... I'm doing good.

39:37.065 --> 39:41.065
Listen, I'm sorry I never made it
to Amy's memorial, but I...

39:41.161 --> 39:43.856
That's okay, you were inside, you couldn't.

39:44.489 --> 39:46.887
- When did you get out?
- A couple of months ago.

39:46.983 --> 39:50.346
- I'm 83 days clean and sober now.
- Good.

39:50.442 --> 39:52.624
Hey, are you okay?

39:53.192 --> 39:54.633
Yeah.

39:54.729 --> 39:56.687
Let me see.

40:07.625 --> 40:09.744
Tough guy?

40:10.537 --> 40:12.656
It wasn't so bad.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.010
That's not what you think.

40:16.202 --> 40:18.505
I used to work in a restaurant.

40:18.601 --> 40:20.621
I was baking muffins.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.657
Looking for Blackway.

40:23.753 --> 40:25.936
Where can I find him?

40:29.289 --> 40:31.426
Didn't you just hear me?

40:31.521 --> 40:34.206
- I'm clean now, 83 days.
- So?

40:34.302 --> 40:37.232
So, the last thing I need
to know is where Blackway is.

40:39.113 --> 40:41.807
- You used to work in a restaurant?
- Yep.

40:42.696 --> 40:45.776
I was even gonna open
my own place someday.

40:46.377 --> 40:49.955
Until the asshole that I was with
snorted up all our money.

40:51.625 --> 40:53.930
What kind of food was it gonna be?

40:54.698 --> 40:57.322
Just... something simple.

40:57.417 --> 40:59.337
Breakfast, lunch, coffee.

40:59.433 --> 41:01.584
Where is he, Chris?

41:02.649 --> 41:04.986
Where is Blackway?

41:05.418 --> 41:09.225
What I hear is, he's up at that
old motel he owns out on route 40.

41:09.321 --> 41:11.887
- The Hylatt?
- Yeah.

41:12.233 --> 41:14.442
Listen, just watch yourself.

41:14.538 --> 41:16.746
I hear he's into all kinds
of heavy shit now.

41:16.842 --> 41:19.497
Meth, hillbilly heroin,
all kinds of stuff.

41:21.161 --> 41:23.210
Who he's got working for him?

41:24.265 --> 41:27.562
I don't know their names. I don't know.

41:28.665 --> 41:30.815
They ain't from around here.

41:33.833 --> 41:36.560
You should open up
a place like that in town.

41:36.905 --> 41:39.656
- Here.
- We could use some good coffee.

41:39.752 --> 41:41.743
And good anything.

41:44.522 --> 41:47.466
You should... let Roena deal with that.

41:47.562 --> 41:49.705
Shut up, Les.

41:49.801 --> 41:51.049
- Who's Roena?
- No one.

41:51.145 --> 41:53.833
She's little honey pie, his girlfriend.

41:53.929 --> 41:57.151
- Shut up, Les.
- She works over there at the clinic.

41:57.257 --> 41:58.934
- A nurse?
- She's a technician.

41:59.030 --> 42:01.451
- That's not what I heard.
- Well, you heard wrong.

42:01.547 --> 42:05.679
- Roena, I love you.
- Shut up, Les, you're not funny.

42:16.392 --> 42:18.857
- What are you doing with her, Les?
- Who?

42:18.953 --> 42:21.993
- Her.
- Helping her out.

42:22.089 --> 42:24.235
Shouldn't get involved.

42:24.810 --> 42:26.992
Don't get in his way.

42:45.513 --> 42:47.850
- That his truck?
- No.

42:47.946 --> 42:50.319
He drives a silver monster truck.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.753
Quite a big operation, going on here.

42:55.849 --> 43:00.010
Plenty of parking space and lots of rooms.

43:00.106 --> 43:02.473
Lots of young girls, probably.

43:02.953 --> 43:05.482
Their just kids. Bastard.

43:05.578 --> 43:09.193
No, it's good. When the sheriff
sees this, he'll have to do something.

43:09.289 --> 43:10.922
Oh, yeah?

43:11.017 --> 43:14.922
He's not going to cross Blackway, that's why
he sent you to see... what's the guy's name?

43:15.018 --> 43:17.247
- Scotty.
- Scotty.

43:19.752 --> 43:24.559
The only one that's gonna get this pig
is somebody he cannot buy off.

43:26.889 --> 43:29.257
Okay, I'm gonna see what's going on.

43:29.737 --> 43:32.207
- Then I'll come with you.
- Stay here.

43:46.057 --> 43:48.143
You're gonna spill it!

43:48.586 --> 43:51.148
- Bitch, you spill it!
- Give it to me!

43:53.481 --> 43:56.009
- Come on, I need some!
- Shut up!

43:56.872 --> 44:00.554
- Did he say who they were?
- I don't know, some old fuck and his kid.

44:00.650 --> 44:02.965
Might have been his son,
Murdoch wasn't sure.

44:03.061 --> 44:05.290
Said he hadn't seen him before
or the girl.

44:05.385 --> 44:08.842
- Girl?
- She's the one looking for you.

44:09.513 --> 44:13.673
- What girl's looking for me? For what?
- I don't know.

44:13.769 --> 44:16.762
- You the dead girl's grandfather?
- Her father.

44:16.858 --> 44:20.576
Wouldn't blame a man for having
a few drinks after burying his daughter.

44:23.048 --> 44:25.193
Put your window down.

44:25.481 --> 44:27.594
Where you going
in such a hurry, old timer?

44:27.690 --> 44:30.313
- Home.
- You've been drinking?

44:30.409 --> 44:33.546
- No.
- You sure about that?

44:33.642 --> 44:36.426
Yeah. Just get on with it.

44:36.522 --> 44:37.961
What did you say?

44:38.057 --> 44:40.297
- Just write the goddamn tick...
- Get out of the truck.

44:40.393 --> 44:43.933
Get out of the truck! Now!

44:47.912 --> 44:51.530
- Where you coming from, all dressed up?
- Been to Morrison's.

44:51.626 --> 44:54.448
- Funeral parlor?
- Yeah.

44:55.561 --> 44:57.530
- You the dead girl's grandfather?
- Her father.

44:57.626 --> 45:00.080
- You're her father.
- Yeah.

45:00.425 --> 45:04.111
Well, wouldn't blame a man for having
a few drinks after burying his daughter.

45:05.192 --> 45:07.657
I haven't been drinking.
I won't say it again.

45:07.753 --> 45:11.600
You gonna say it as many
goddamn times as I want you to say it.

45:12.808 --> 45:15.791
Let's go, this way. The old sobriety test.

45:17.545 --> 45:20.074
I don't have any kids, myself.

45:20.169 --> 45:22.537
At least, none that I know of.

45:22.921 --> 45:25.290
Gotta be pretty fucked up, though.

45:25.386 --> 45:27.881
Watch your only kid running wild.

45:27.977 --> 45:32.361
Hanging out with the bad crowd.
Getting mixed up with drugs.

45:32.649 --> 45:35.951
Let's go, let's go, let's go,
walk, pop, walk.

45:37.032 --> 45:40.265
Wondering, "Was I a good dad?
Was I a bad dad?

45:40.361 --> 45:43.568
"Was I too strict? Not strict enough?"

45:44.904 --> 45:47.600
Let me put your mind at ease, old man.

45:48.329 --> 45:50.350
In my experience,

45:50.446 --> 45:52.329
from what I've seen...

45:52.425 --> 45:54.794
nothing you could have done.

45:55.081 --> 45:56.681
A girl like Amy.

45:56.777 --> 45:59.113
She can't be contained.

45:59.209 --> 46:01.675
You sure as shit ain't gonna change her.

46:03.017 --> 46:05.424
You were probably just a bad dad.

46:08.073 --> 46:09.839
You're done.

46:13.737 --> 46:16.035
Did you just hear that?

46:32.360 --> 46:35.018
- Just the ice machine.
- All right.

46:35.114 --> 46:37.161
Catch ya later.

46:37.449 --> 46:39.439
Aright, see ya.

47:04.425 --> 47:06.031
Shit.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.968
That was his motorcycle, what happened?
Did you talk to him?

47:14.064 --> 47:16.232
Yeah, we sat down, had a cup of tea,
talked about the weather,

47:16.327 --> 47:19.792
the movies, and everything.
What the hell do you think I did?

47:20.744 --> 47:22.665
So, what now?

47:25.429 --> 47:27.532
We just have to find out, that's all.

47:30.408 --> 47:32.584
Can you give him a message for me?

47:32.680 --> 47:35.946
Tell him "Delphine says,
'hey' and, he should call me."

47:36.041 --> 47:38.408
- Fuck am I, an answering service?
- Tell him.

47:38.504 --> 47:41.737
Good afternoon. God, it's cold, isn't it?

47:41.833 --> 47:44.330
- Who are you?
- So, we're looking for Richard Blackway.

47:44.425 --> 47:46.027
- Do you know where he is?
- He ain't here.

47:46.123 --> 47:50.416
We've been trying to find him, but...
where is he? Do you know where he went?

47:51.816 --> 47:54.377
- Are you... where did he go to?
- Why do you want Blackway?

47:54.473 --> 47:58.121
Well, because we are from the church
of the holy spirit, you understand?

47:58.217 --> 48:01.737
And he won. Well, I mean, he won
the church raffle, it's unbelievable.

48:01.833 --> 48:05.098
- He won it.
- Won what?

48:05.193 --> 48:07.894
Well, the fact is...

48:08.987 --> 48:12.649
- He won the toaster oven, you know?
- Christ the redeemer.

48:12.745 --> 48:15.751
Christ the redeemer, God bless him.
Amen, praise Jesus.

48:15.846 --> 48:17.417
Trudy.

48:17.801 --> 48:20.528
Trudy, it's me. It's Lillian.

48:21.065 --> 48:24.719
We went to Mckinley together.
No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

48:25.260 --> 48:26.313
We gotta get you out of here.

48:26.409 --> 48:28.585
He won a toaster oven,
just like one of these, I suppose.

48:28.681 --> 48:29.971
No, he didn't, he won the gas...

48:30.067 --> 48:32.687
Where are the keys? Where are the keys?

48:34.242 --> 48:37.199
- You're thinking of last year.
- He won the toaster...

48:43.097 --> 48:45.546
You're thinking of last year.
Denny won the cord of wood.

48:45.642 --> 48:48.125
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Good afternoon.

48:48.317 --> 48:49.468
- What the fuck is this?
- What?

48:49.564 --> 48:51.850
- Who are they?
- They're looking for Blackway.

48:51.946 --> 48:53.273
- He won a toaster.
- He won a what?

48:53.369 --> 48:56.557
- He won that toaster oven.
- No, you're right. I just didn't...

49:00.264 --> 49:02.031
That's right.

49:04.712 --> 49:07.907
- Who are you, what the fuck do you want?
- Well, we're from the IRS.

49:08.003 --> 49:11.817
We want to know where Blackway's hanging
out these days. Can you tell me, please?

49:11.913 --> 49:14.441
Yeah, I know who you are, now.

49:14.537 --> 49:16.417
Fuck you, old man.

49:19.752 --> 49:22.333
What the hell are you doing?
You're crazy. What's the matter with you?

49:22.429 --> 49:24.265
- Tell me where is Blackway?
- I don't know, he's...

49:24.361 --> 49:25.993
Where is he?

49:26.089 --> 49:27.850
- Where is he?
- I don't...

49:29.672 --> 49:32.180
- Where is Blackway? Tell me.
- You shot me in the foot!

49:32.276 --> 49:35.453
I'll shoot the other one.
Where is Blackway? Where?

49:35.881 --> 49:37.386
- Tell me where's Blackway.
- I don't know.

49:37.482 --> 49:39.245
- Where? You know where he is!
- He's in the town!

49:39.340 --> 49:42.327
- Where is he?
- I don't know! He's got a place in the town.

49:42.423 --> 49:44.860
- Where, you son of a bitch
- I don't know!

49:47.465 --> 49:50.761
- We gotta go. Les, we gotta go.
- Old man, listen to me...

49:50.857 --> 49:52.993
Les, we gotta go!

49:53.288 --> 49:55.785
Get the...
I'm gonna fucking kill both of you!

49:55.881 --> 49:58.223
You're both fucking dead!

50:05.064 --> 50:07.434
- Did you have to blow the place up?
- Sorry.

50:07.530 --> 50:09.596
Sorry, are you nuts?

50:10.984 --> 50:13.225
I'm gonna fucking bury you!

50:13.321 --> 50:15.919
I'm gonna fucking bury you!

50:22.856 --> 50:24.381
- We're never gonna find him now.
- Who?

50:24.477 --> 50:27.145
Blackway, Blackway, Blackway!
What's the matter with you? Wake up!

50:27.241 --> 50:31.081
What the hell do you think I'm talking about?
Could be anywhere up in the towns, anywhere!

50:31.177 --> 50:33.449
- Who's that?
- A friend, we went to high school together.

50:33.545 --> 50:35.131
- Why is she with us?
- She's coming with us.

50:35.227 --> 50:37.623
- She's not coming anywhere.
- We need to get her to a hospital.

50:37.719 --> 50:39.561
- What's the matter with her?
- He's gonna kill her.

50:39.657 --> 50:41.859
- So?
- We can't just leave her here!

50:41.955 --> 50:44.314
She needs to see a doctor!
He cut her in the face!

50:44.409 --> 50:47.100
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

50:47.816 --> 50:49.545
Shut up!

50:49.641 --> 50:52.841
- What's your name, kid?
- Trudy.

50:52.937 --> 50:55.913
Are those freaks up at the motel,
did they do this to you, kid? Mess you up?

50:56.009 --> 50:58.890
- Blackway, the worst?
- Yeah.

50:59.849 --> 51:03.753
She doesn't need a hospital, she needs to
get the hell away from this place, right now.

51:17.224 --> 51:19.712
- Now, if she was... what's her name?
- Lillian.

51:19.808 --> 51:22.703
Yeah, if she was smart,
she'd get on the bus with her.

51:23.432 --> 51:26.991
- She seems smart.
- Yeah, you too.

51:28.151 --> 51:31.583
- Thanks.
- I meant, if you got on the bus with them.

51:34.441 --> 51:37.578
Well, we're not gonna
find Blackway now, and...

51:37.865 --> 51:41.001
next time we see him, is when he finds us.

51:41.097 --> 51:43.312
Gonna hang around for that?

51:45.992 --> 51:49.225
I hear Portland... is pretty nice.

51:49.705 --> 51:52.041
That's what they say.

51:52.137 --> 51:54.224
Oh, not so smart.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.576
- All right, let's go.
- Where?

51:57.672 --> 52:01.033
Blackway's up in the town forest.
As much chance as finding Bigfoot up there.

52:01.129 --> 52:03.689
Trudy said he's got a camp
near the old gold mine.

52:03.881 --> 52:07.984
- The old noisy creek logging site?
- Yep, that's what she said.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.272
What are you waiting for?

52:14.344 --> 52:16.015
Okay.

52:56.264 --> 52:59.401
You don't have to go with us.
You know that?

52:59.497 --> 53:01.636
Sure, I do.

53:02.153 --> 53:03.945
Okay.

53:04.041 --> 53:06.761
Once you do, you're gonna go all the way.

53:07.144 --> 53:09.545
There's no turning back.

53:09.641 --> 53:11.817
You ready for that?

53:11.913 --> 53:14.090
You mean kill him.

53:15.241 --> 53:18.388
Yeah, I guess so. Maybe.

53:19.879 --> 53:24.239
Well, if it's not me or Trudy,
it will be some other girl.

53:25.064 --> 53:26.601
Right?

53:27.081 --> 53:28.873
Right.

53:29.736 --> 53:31.913
Let's get on with it, then.

53:32.872 --> 53:34.571
Okay.

53:39.464 --> 53:43.056
<i>Old Lester and me,
we got our start in them woods.</i>

53:44.424 --> 53:48.231
<i>Only things that like it up there
in the towns are bears...</i>

53:48.327 --> 53:49.896
<i>moose, and beavers.</i>

53:49.992 --> 53:52.873
<i>Whatever else it was
that got those Canadian fellas.</i>

53:52.969 --> 53:54.696
<i>What fellas?</i>

53:54.792 --> 53:59.113
<i>Loggin' crew, down from B.C.
Tough sons of bitches.</i>

53:59.209 --> 54:03.336
<i>Now it's April, a couple,
three feet of snow on the ground...</i>

54:03.868 --> 54:06.179
logging company hasn't...

54:07.118 --> 54:09.610
heard from them in quite a while.

54:10.952 --> 54:14.045
So, he sends them in in snowshoes to...

54:14.668 --> 54:17.580
hike in there and find out what's what.

54:19.559 --> 54:25.002
When he finally gets to that cabin
he finds the log skidder marked out front.

54:25.865 --> 54:28.375
Inside, their clothes...

54:28.471 --> 54:32.396
equipment, old weather gear.

54:34.344 --> 54:37.833
Even plates of food still on the table.

54:38.600 --> 54:41.685
Just like they was interrupted
in the middle of supper.

54:43.496 --> 54:47.068
But of those four woodchoppers, he finds...

54:47.164 --> 54:49.142
not a trace.

54:51.721 --> 54:54.672
Nor did anyone else ever.

54:57.959 --> 55:00.176
That's towns for ya.

55:22.792 --> 55:25.865
I used to know some kids from high school
that used to go to towns to party.

55:25.961 --> 55:27.899
They're lucky they didn't...

55:27.995 --> 55:31.103
didn't... get lost.

55:32.262 --> 55:36.239
Hundred square miles of nothing.

55:36.680 --> 55:39.017
It's like the Bermuda triangle,

55:39.305 --> 55:42.544
- except for fucking trees.
- Hey, watch your language, will ya?

55:50.151 --> 55:52.496
Towns are a weird place.

55:54.728 --> 55:56.880
Long way off the road.

56:36.583 --> 56:38.927
Okay, we walk from here.

56:54.311 --> 56:56.270
It gets cold.

58:06.535 --> 58:08.393
Dewar's on the rocks.

58:08.489 --> 58:11.011
- Thanks.
- You want to start a tab?

58:13.672 --> 58:16.304
No. Here.

58:17.129 --> 58:20.239
Take it out of... take it out of this.

58:20.776 --> 58:22.736
Keep the change.

58:23.944 --> 58:25.961
That's a really nice tip.

58:26.153 --> 58:28.199
- That's a really nice smile.
- Thank you.

58:28.295 --> 58:30.639
What, for the compliment or the tip?

58:31.912 --> 58:33.519
Both.

58:34.696 --> 58:36.809
Can I get you anything else?

58:37.385 --> 58:41.839
- Something from the kitchen maybe?
- No. Just your name.

58:42.120 --> 58:46.031
- Lillian.
- "Lillian." I like the name "Lillian."

58:46.535 --> 58:48.520
You're new around here, aren't ya, Lillian?

58:48.616 --> 58:51.375
Sort of. It's been a while.

58:52.584 --> 58:54.703
What time do you get off?

58:55.591 --> 58:58.440
- In about an hour.
- Oh, I can wait.

58:58.536 --> 59:00.425
- I can't.
- Can't?

59:00.521 --> 59:03.342
All right, well... have a seat, then.

59:03.944 --> 59:06.943
- That's not what I meant.
- I know what you meant.

59:08.152 --> 59:11.835
- I have to get home.
- You got someone waitin' for ya?

59:12.393 --> 59:14.093
- Husband?
- My mom.

59:14.189 --> 59:17.175
Your mom. Your mom's waitin'.

59:17.270 --> 59:21.033
Well, call her up, tell her you're
gonna be late. She'll understand.

59:21.129 --> 59:24.751
If she's as pretty as her daughter,
she'll understand real well.

59:28.167 --> 59:30.095
I gotta go.

59:32.327 --> 59:34.319
Okay, Lillian.

59:44.743 --> 59:46.898
This way, over there.

59:55.111 --> 59:57.353
My offer still stands.

59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.745
- "Offer"?
- For a drink.

01:00:00.841 --> 01:00:04.233
- I just got off work.
- We'll go somewhere else.

01:00:04.329 --> 01:00:06.569
We'll go to my house.

01:00:06.665 --> 01:00:08.968
Listen, I'm exhausted.

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:13.006
I really just want to go home
and go to bed, you know?

01:00:20.904 --> 01:00:23.248
Hey, asshole, I'm serious.

01:00:25.256 --> 01:00:27.471
What do you want?

01:00:28.487 --> 01:00:29.832
Same as you, Lillian.

01:00:29.928 --> 01:00:33.368
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:35.768
You got your shirt on
that barely covers your breast.

01:00:35.864 --> 01:00:39.305
You got your best jeans on
to make your ass look so good.

01:00:39.401 --> 01:00:41.065
That's right, you got my attention.

01:00:41.161 --> 01:00:43.049
Now the question is,
what are you gonna do about it?

01:00:43.145 --> 01:00:46.851
Please, please, just let me get in my car.

01:00:50.056 --> 01:00:53.167
- Under one condition.
- What's that?

01:00:54.023 --> 01:00:55.381
Give me a kiss.

01:00:56.263 --> 01:00:58.414
Is this a joke?

01:01:03.428 --> 01:01:06.446
If I give you a kiss,
will you leave me alone?

01:01:08.392 --> 01:01:10.544
Give me a kiss.

01:01:17.805 --> 01:01:21.096
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

01:01:21.948 --> 01:01:23.536
Easy.

01:01:42.311 --> 01:01:43.918
Hey!

01:01:46.631 --> 01:01:49.416
- Get back inside.
- Lillian, you all right?

01:01:49.512 --> 01:01:52.976
Moron! Get back inside!

01:01:54.247 --> 01:01:57.093
- Now!
- Okay.

01:02:07.943 --> 01:02:09.711
<i>My fault.</i>

01:02:12.488 --> 01:02:15.721
He seemed like a regular guy.
I didn't know what to do.

01:02:16.296 --> 01:02:18.414
I was just trying to be friendly.

01:02:18.663 --> 01:02:20.847
Oh, it isn't your fault.

01:02:21.191 --> 01:02:23.816
Doesn't matter what you did,
what you didn't do.

01:02:23.912 --> 01:02:26.793
Blackway's just a piece of shit. Fuck him.

01:02:27.848 --> 01:02:30.313
He'd have found you
either way, that's life.

01:02:30.409 --> 01:02:32.903
If it wasn't Blackway,
it'd be something else, wouldn't it?

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:36.647
Cancer, car wreck, drugs, dope.

01:02:36.743 --> 01:02:38.926
Suicide, overdose.

01:02:39.304 --> 01:02:43.182
You name it, it's all...
it's always going to be something.

01:02:43.944 --> 01:02:46.062
It's all in the game.

01:02:46.599 --> 01:02:48.201
Yeah.

01:02:48.584 --> 01:02:51.177
None of us gets out of this life without...

01:02:51.273 --> 01:02:53.865
some bad stuff comes looking for us.

01:02:54.632 --> 01:02:58.249
Keep our heads down,
hope it passes us by. Or we can...

01:02:59.016 --> 01:03:01.672
you know, do what we're doing now.

01:03:01.768 --> 01:03:03.784
What's that?

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.537
We're gonna meet
the son of a bitch, aren't we?

01:03:06.633 --> 01:03:08.936
Head to head, face to face.

01:03:09.032 --> 01:03:12.431
Fuck him. Piece of shit.

01:03:14.855 --> 01:03:16.399
Trash.

01:03:56.039 --> 01:03:59.241
- So, this is it?
- Yeah.

01:03:59.337 --> 01:04:03.047
Got my first work here. In the woods.

01:04:03.816 --> 01:04:05.385
Yeah.

01:04:06.152 --> 01:04:09.167
This place was called "Boyd's Job."

01:04:11.271 --> 01:04:15.150
50 men working, living here.

01:04:15.815 --> 01:04:17.582
Pretty tough.

01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:20.921
And... no logging had been done here for...

01:04:21.815 --> 01:04:24.766
oh, maybe, 20 years, maybe longer.

01:04:25.287 --> 01:04:27.438
Jimmy Malla's truck.

01:04:27.847 --> 01:04:31.087
Jimmy Malla. He's dead and gone.

01:04:35.303 --> 01:04:37.135
And that.

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:40.713
Wow.

01:04:41.289 --> 01:04:43.241
Holy Moses.

01:04:43.865 --> 01:04:45.823
Nothing's changed.

01:04:56.199 --> 01:04:58.383
Must be Blackway's.

01:05:00.967 --> 01:05:02.510
Yeah.

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:19.081
Now, this is his bunk house.

01:05:19.368 --> 01:05:21.083
Wasn't here in my day.

01:05:21.179 --> 01:05:25.223
He doesn't go in for much
housekeeping, does he?

01:05:28.711 --> 01:05:31.688
Hey. Make yourself useful.

01:05:31.784 --> 01:05:34.537
Cut some timber and make a fire.

01:05:34.633 --> 01:05:38.280
Make it a big one. Got a lighter?

01:05:38.376 --> 01:05:41.390
- Yeah.
- Okay. Make it a big fire.

01:05:54.886 --> 01:05:56.910
You two okay?

01:05:57.862 --> 01:05:59.438
Yeah.

01:06:00.487 --> 01:06:02.863
I'm gonna have a look around.

01:06:04.999 --> 01:06:06.856
- What, now?
- What?

01:06:06.952 --> 01:06:10.254
- Now?
- Yeah, we got time.

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.712
He won't be here for a while.

01:06:12.808 --> 01:06:15.640
- When he does come, we'll hear it.
- How do you know?

01:06:15.928 --> 01:06:19.952
Well, the only way in and out of this place
on wheels, coming up the logging road.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:24.713
And he drives one of those big,
stupid, diesel trucks of his.

01:06:24.904 --> 01:06:26.975
So, we'll hear him two miles away.

01:06:33.223 --> 01:06:36.872
- What the hell is that?
- It's a goose gun.

01:06:36.968 --> 01:06:39.209
Belonged to my uncle Walter.

01:06:39.304 --> 01:06:42.312
Next biggest aid to us is heavy artillery.

01:06:42.408 --> 01:06:45.710
- Fuckin' thing's an antique.
- Yeah.

01:06:46.087 --> 01:06:48.206
Still works, though.

01:06:49.127 --> 01:06:51.118
I hope so.

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:55.694
Okay, well...

01:06:56.199 --> 01:06:58.376
- Lester.
- Yeah?

01:06:58.472 --> 01:07:01.422
There's something wrong.
We need to get out of here.

01:07:01.831 --> 01:07:05.672
Too late now, kid. You've crossed the line.

01:07:06.248 --> 01:07:08.360
No going back.

01:07:08.456 --> 01:07:10.632
You were warned.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.719
Weren't you?

01:07:25.767 --> 01:07:27.343
Okay.

01:08:08.199 --> 01:08:11.438
Have you ever fired one of those?

01:08:15.399 --> 01:08:17.198
Come here.

01:08:20.423 --> 01:08:22.158
Show me.

01:08:23.943 --> 01:08:27.336
Why are you standing sideways?

01:08:27.432 --> 01:08:29.358
You're not surfing.

01:08:31.527 --> 01:08:33.224
Like this.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:34.875
Yeah.

01:08:37.192 --> 01:08:41.087
Make sure it's not loaded.
Trying to kill me?

01:08:43.158 --> 01:08:45.528
Yeah, same thing.

01:08:46.535 --> 01:08:48.712
Use both hands.

01:08:49.287 --> 01:08:51.591
Hold it tight.

01:08:51.688 --> 01:08:53.000
I am.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:55.560
Got a recoil.

01:08:55.656 --> 01:08:59.247
Line your target up with your sight.

01:09:01.255 --> 01:09:02.862
Up.

01:09:04.487 --> 01:09:06.862
Squeeze the trigger.

01:09:07.687 --> 01:09:09.263
Okay.

01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:12.777
Boom.

01:09:13.352 --> 01:09:15.149
That's good.

01:09:16.582 --> 01:09:19.662
And now we put the bullets in it.

01:09:26.215 --> 01:09:28.359
Can I ask you something?

01:09:31.495 --> 01:09:35.490
Why didn't ya... you leave?

01:09:36.519 --> 01:09:38.631
When Blackway was bothering you,

01:09:38.728 --> 01:09:40.825
why didn't...

01:09:42.532 --> 01:09:44.304
you run?

01:09:46.054 --> 01:09:48.232
- 'Cause that's all I've ever done.
- Here.

01:09:48.328 --> 01:09:50.377
And I'm tired of it.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.830
You know, I'm starting to realize
that maybe Lester's right.

01:09:55.143 --> 01:09:57.519
Some people are just bad.

01:10:05.767 --> 01:10:08.648
- What's Seattle like?
- It's nice.

01:10:08.743 --> 01:10:12.457
When it's not raining.
You should go sometime.

01:10:13.032 --> 01:10:15.815
Les always says I should travel.

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:19.272
Well, why don't you?
I thought you always do what Lester says.

01:10:19.368 --> 01:10:21.502
Not always.

01:10:29.543 --> 01:10:31.727
How'd you two meet?

01:10:34.198 --> 01:10:35.583
Work.

01:10:36.934 --> 01:10:38.510
Les...

01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:42.317
says that his daughter

01:10:42.413 --> 01:10:45.187
used to be babysit me. I can't remember.

01:11:00.743 --> 01:11:02.632
Hello, sweetheart.

01:11:02.728 --> 01:11:05.560
Don't fucking move, Skippy. Don't move.

01:11:09.495 --> 01:11:12.381
Where'd you get this? Where'd you get this?

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:14.926
Where'd you get this?

01:11:22.823 --> 01:11:25.096
Why you looking so surprised?

01:11:25.864 --> 01:11:28.622
You actually think you could
get the jump on me?

01:11:29.639 --> 01:11:33.701
You and your boyfriend, running all
over town, asking questions about me?

01:11:33.797 --> 01:11:38.344
You burned down my place of business,
you beat up my fucking accountant.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.039
You think I wouldn't find out about this?

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.543
I've been waitin' here for you.

01:11:49.094 --> 01:11:50.545
- Where is he?
- Who?

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.952
- Don't fuck with me! Where is he?
- I don't know!

01:11:55.288 --> 01:11:58.198
- I don't know.
- Where is that old fuck?

01:12:01.127 --> 01:12:02.510
Shit.

01:12:11.607 --> 01:12:13.047
Damn it!

01:12:57.031 --> 01:13:01.028
- I got you now, you bastard.
- Watch this, sweetheart.

01:13:10.727 --> 01:13:12.744
I got the old man, he was on the bus.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.983
Keep an eye on him. I'll get her.

01:13:46.166 --> 01:13:48.223
Hey, Lillian!

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:54.121
Lillian!

01:13:56.647 --> 01:13:58.606
Here, sweetheart.

01:14:39.911 --> 01:14:41.517
Lillian!

01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:13.198
Blackway.

01:16:30.311 --> 01:16:32.615
That antique still works?

01:16:32.711 --> 01:16:34.312
Yeah.

01:16:34.696 --> 01:16:36.455
Murdoch?

01:16:36.839 --> 01:16:39.208
He's by the skidder.

01:16:39.304 --> 01:16:42.030
- Is he breathing?
- No.

01:16:43.146 --> 01:16:44.878
Come on.

01:16:51.078 --> 01:16:52.686
Yeah.

01:16:55.207 --> 01:16:57.166
Now, we'll...

01:16:58.118 --> 01:17:00.441
drag them both off into the woods.

01:17:03.014 --> 01:17:05.160
What if somebody finds them?

01:17:05.255 --> 01:17:07.271
Not up here, they won't.

01:17:07.367 --> 01:17:10.503
Coyotes, buzzards, foxes, crows.

01:17:10.599 --> 01:17:13.081
They'll find 'em first, and...

01:17:13.177 --> 01:17:15.592
take them to little bits and pieces.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.249
They'll be nothing left of them in a week.

01:17:21.094 --> 01:17:22.862
Okay.

01:17:49.606 --> 01:17:51.534
He used us as bait.

01:17:57.015 --> 01:18:00.163
He used us to draw Blackway
out into the open.

01:18:00.648 --> 01:18:02.664
- Yeah.
- And it worked.

01:18:02.759 --> 01:18:04.493
Sure did.

01:18:09.798 --> 01:18:13.095
It would have worked better
if Joe Palooka there hadn't...

01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:17.448
picked a fight with Blackway
and spoiled my best shot.

01:18:18.758 --> 01:18:21.513
- That was your plan?
- Yeah.

01:18:22.568 --> 01:18:24.160
Yeah.

01:18:25.096 --> 01:18:28.654
Blackway liked to think he was
the worst guy around, and...

01:18:29.862 --> 01:18:33.049
Didn't think anyone
would ever go as far as he did.

01:18:33.145 --> 01:18:36.484
That made him sloppy and predictable.

01:18:39.143 --> 01:18:40.686
Yeah.

01:18:41.928 --> 01:18:44.616
If the worst guy around
makes that mistake...

01:18:44.999 --> 01:18:48.507
the second worst guy has a chance.

01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:52.456
"Second worst guy"?

01:18:52.552 --> 01:18:54.408
That's you?

01:18:54.887 --> 01:18:56.690
Not anymore.

01:19:11.431 --> 01:19:14.663
What do you say? Enough light?

01:19:14.758 --> 01:19:17.645
Let's go,
let's get the hell out of this place.

01:19:18.534 --> 01:19:20.494
Hey, let's go.

01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:26.311
You did it.

01:21:26.695 --> 01:21:28.269
Yeah.

01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:35.910
What if...

01:21:36.006 --> 01:21:38.228
one of Blackway's men...

01:21:39.942 --> 01:21:41.679
"Blackway."

01:21:49.254 --> 01:21:51.246
Who's "Blackway"?

01:21:59.302 --> 01:22:00.654
Lester...

01:22:06.342 --> 01:22:08.522
See ya around.

01:22:39.078 --> 01:22:41.741
You gonna get your girlfriend Roena
to take care of that?

01:22:42.346 --> 01:22:45.101
Dammit, I told you, she's not my girlfriend.

01:22:46.038 --> 01:22:50.126
Lester just thinks she is because her car
broke down once, and I gave her a ride.

01:22:51.238 --> 01:22:54.055
- Then what is she?
- Roena?

01:22:55.302 --> 01:22:57.837
I don't know.

01:22:58.822 --> 01:23:00.935
She might be my cousin.

01:23:01.222 --> 01:23:02.887
What?

01:23:04.038 --> 01:23:05.617
Her...

01:23:05.713 --> 01:23:10.536
stepdad's my mother's cousin,
so what's that make me?

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:13.240
Full of surprises.

01:23:14.305 --> 01:23:20.198
