00:01.960 --> 00:03.503
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:03.587 --> 00:05.755
I think I'm pregnant.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.924
Apparently, there's been a problem
with shrinkage.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.218
No! Not "apparently."

00:12.179 --> 00:13.930
You paid a publicist, didn't you?

00:14.306 --> 00:16.265
I have a publicist, yes,

00:16.350 --> 00:21.646
but that is not why I was chosen for the list
of the best 25 doctors in Manhattan.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.524
Your accent,
London with a touch of Sussex, right?

00:24.608 --> 00:26.901
-Indeed.
-I'm kind of an Anglophile.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.695
How convenient. I'm an Anglo.

00:32.408 --> 00:35.076
-I have a girlfriend.
-So do I.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.080
Do not take it out on him.

00:39.164 --> 00:43.334
-Who? Who am I taking it out on?
-Thor. He's diabetic. You know that, right?

00:43.419 --> 00:45.169
-It's nurse Jackie.
-Really?

00:45.254 --> 00:49.924
She constantly challenges my decisions,
is bossy and rude.

00:50.008 --> 00:54.178
My house, my kids?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

00:54.263 --> 00:57.765
-I can't just turn it off like you can.
-I didn't turn it off, Eddie.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.768
Do you want to know what your problem is?
You're fucking greedy.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.692
-Didn't you practice?
-That's not very nice, Kaitlyn.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.278
Okay, I told you not to scold my child.

01:10.362 --> 01:13.364
I asked your child
to make a little bit of room for my child.

01:13.449 --> 01:14.824
And I think I said, "Please."

01:15.617 --> 01:19.454
She said that her mom
was Dad's girlfriend before you.

01:20.164 --> 01:21.622
Please.

01:21.707 --> 01:26.252
I made too much Tater Tot hot dish
so I thought I'd bring some over.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.046
Kaitlyn says you guys order a lot of pizza.

01:29.131 --> 01:31.299
Yes. We happen to love pizza.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.284
Really? Alice in Wonderland?

03:22.494 --> 03:26.163
It was with the girls. And dinner, too.
We went to dinner.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.125
Dinner and a movie. With?

03:32.045 --> 03:35.256
-Kaitlyn and...
-Ginny?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.550
Yeah. Yeah.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.220
Come on.
It was a last-minute thing, Jackie.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.432
May have been last minute on your part,
not on hers.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.766
I can promise you that.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.107
Are you jealous of Ginny Flynn?

03:56.778 --> 03:58.863
Last minute. Please.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.533
That woman has been planning
what to wear since high school.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.036
You're nuts.

04:05.621 --> 04:08.289
Did she happen to mention
that her marriage is falling apart?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.626
Seriously, Jackie, you're nuts.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.300
Seriously, Kevin, you're mine.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.267
-Shit.
-What?

04:29.311 --> 04:31.896
-I'm sleeping on the couch.
-What?

04:31.980 --> 04:34.607
-Jackie...
-No, I gotta.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.943
Why? Because we went to a movie?

04:38.153 --> 04:41.072
-You're overreacting.
-No, I am reacting.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.949
I get to react, okay?

04:57.464 --> 05:01.217
What just happened back there?
You come strolling in at 2:00 a.m.

05:01.301 --> 05:05.304
-I wanted to see that movie. I told you that.
-Baby, you were working.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.098
Well, then you should've
called me or texted me.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.224
Why didn't you call me?

05:08.850 --> 05:11.018
'Cause I was afraid
you'd end up sleeping on the couch.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.729
Well, congratulations on being right.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.610
See where that gets you.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.963
Is Johnny Depp married?

05:41.216 --> 05:44.719
-Yes, honey, I believe he is.
-We saw Alice in Wonderland.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.223
-You did?
-Tim Burton.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.600
-You need to see it.
-I do?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.227
You'll really like it.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.480
Okay. Done.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.900
You shouldn't be sleeping on the couch.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.080
The unsinkable Ginny Flynn.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.499
With all the stab wounds
and gunshots we get,

06:15.584 --> 06:18.085
you would think that
one of them could be her.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.921
-And we'd let her bleed to death, yes?
-Is that bad?

06:21.006 --> 06:22.840
-My two cents?
-Yes, please.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.092
No sleeping on couches.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.928
It makes people, i.e., husbands,
ask questions

06:28.013 --> 06:29.638
like, "Is something wrong?
Can we talk?" Etcetera.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.265
No good comes of it. Believe me.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.226
Not to mention the fact
that that couch kills my back.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.770
Makes me totally useless.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.898
You are many things, Jacks,
useless is not among them.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.024
You're very sweet.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.068
You need anything, half a Percocet,

06:42.152 --> 06:43.611
-you let me know.
-Yes, I will.

06:43.695 --> 06:47.114
This is the Holy Land's most volatile shrine.

06:47.199 --> 06:50.618
-She's great. I like her.
-She is, isn't she?

06:50.702 --> 06:53.287
Violence here has escalated
into prolonged conflict.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.874
She's leaving Gaza
to take a desk in Washington.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.085
Is that right? How do you know that?

07:00.879 --> 07:04.006
-I know her.
-Really? Wow.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.843
-Swanky life.
-Yeah. Terribly swanky.

07:08.637 --> 07:09.804
God.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.849
-Last call for Percocet.
-No, no, it's too hard on the liver.

07:15.227 --> 07:17.311
Only if you take it in obscene quantities.

07:19.022 --> 07:23.150
Really? You know Sarah Khouri?
God, I could not love her more.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.652
Yeah, well...

07:24.736 --> 07:27.404
Will this be one of those times?

07:28.532 --> 07:30.116
Get in line.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.334
-Is this a good time?
-Sorry.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.256
-Quick and painless.
-I don't know about painless.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.508
Well, then here's to quick.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.730
-Hate you.
-What'd I do?

08:03.316 --> 08:07.236
Not that I'd wish diabetes on any of you,
but look at the shit I have to eat.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.573
-Wasa bread?
-I love wasa bread.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.075
Kind of my point,
it's not a very glamorous food.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.494
Seriously, diabetes,
not a glamorous disease.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.371
I don't know.
Mary Tyler Moore's pretty glamorous.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.749
Yeah, but her glamour comes more
from her business acumen and alcoholism.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.668
-Big diff.
-Suit yourself.

08:22.752 --> 08:23.836
Halle Berry, type one.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.297
I'm not a big baby person,
but have you seen her kid?

08:26.381 --> 08:28.382
Her kid is like gorgeous.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.928
-You okay?
-Why, what have you heard?

08:34.055 --> 08:37.474
People, let it be known, let it be known!

08:37.559 --> 08:42.146
For the time being, Miguel from admitting
will be stationed at the Pill-O-Matix.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.106
-Sorry?
-You heard me.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.526
Until the narcotics situation
is resolved to my satisfaction,

08:47.611 --> 08:48.986
Miguel will be in the pharmacy.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.988
You need an ID badge
to get into the pharmacy.

08:51.072 --> 08:55.201
Any nut job can walk into admitting.
Stupidest thing I ever heard. Really.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.287
Tell your nurses to keep their noses
out of the oxy. How about that?

09:00.123 --> 09:01.624
You are making things worse.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.226
-Percocet?
-Yes, please.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.103
38-year-old male construction worker.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.648
Witnessed a fall
from a second-story scaffolding.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.358
No habla, any of them.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.276
Hey, Zoey. What's up?

09:29.819 --> 09:33.072
Respiration is spontaneous and unlabored.
Large whack to the back of the head.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.365
Probably broke a couple ribs.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.200
Let's call up for a scan
and see what we got.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.203
On my count. One two three.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.880
You look nice, very pretty.
You're rocking a little glow.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.924
I know, okay? Shut up.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.931
Gun! Gun.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.818
-Jackie Peyton, armed and dangerous.
-Do not tempt me.

10:11.987 --> 10:13.821
-Security!
-Pharmacy.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.198
Jesus Christ.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.206
Make yourself useful.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.587
Hey, Kev.

10:30.672 --> 10:34.633
I thought the worst thing
about sleeping on the couch would be

10:34.718 --> 10:37.261
how it fucks up my back, but I was wrong.

10:37.345 --> 10:41.390
It was waking up without you next to me.
So, there.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.808
Call me back.

10:43.601 --> 10:44.977
He needs stitches.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.104
Squishy.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.984
Two things. Dr. Cooper,
I need a word alone with you.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.237
I heard there was a gun.
Check his belongings, proof of registration.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.782
If he's not carrying it,
get security to cuff him to the bed rail.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.617
-He's unconscious.
-Out like a light.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.537
-Sleeping like a baby.
-Don't care.

11:06.624 --> 11:11.086
The upside is she does rise to the occasion
when there's, like, a gun or something.

11:11.171 --> 11:15.591
-Most of the time, she just comes off...
-I didn't ask you here to talk about Jackie.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.385
-No?
-No.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.431
You're a very good-looking man,
Dr. Cooper.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.976
Man. See, this always happens.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.562
I'm flattered, Gloria.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.357
And I love older women,
so it's not that, but...

11:31.441 --> 11:33.901
Okay, stop. I'm heartbroken.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.654
Dr. Cooper,
I have been saddled with the task

11:37.739 --> 11:41.241
of attracting more insured patients.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.661
-A better grade of clientele.
-In a word, yes.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.789
Our friends at the Sussman Foundation
are interested

11:46.873 --> 11:50.501
in making meaningful contributions
to a distinguished medical facility,

11:50.585 --> 11:53.212
not a ramshackle urgent care center.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.839
-We're distinguished.
-Not like we were 30 years ago.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.424
-I was five.
-Yeah.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.676
And given your recent write-up...

12:01.596 --> 12:03.514
I see what you're getting at.

12:03.598 --> 12:07.309
You want me to show up
at a couple of black ties,

12:07.394 --> 12:11.021
deliver a few speeches.
Tell me when and where.

12:11.106 --> 12:14.858
Hobnobbing is my gift,
that and really tiny stitches.

12:14.943 --> 12:20.781
We want to launch a citywide campaign,
buses, subway stops,

12:21.199 --> 12:25.285
featuring you as the face of All Saints.

12:26.955 --> 12:30.416
-So, no speeches?
-Not ruling it out.

12:31.459 --> 12:35.963
-Do I get paid?
-I've had legal draw up a little...

12:36.047 --> 12:38.632
-Take a look.
-I'll totally give the money to charity.

12:38.716 --> 12:42.219
Or new skis. No!
Charity's better, yes? Charity.

12:43.721 --> 12:47.808
-I'd like to have my team give it a look-see.
-By all means.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.811
Mostly charity.

12:58.736 --> 13:02.030
-Did you catch anybody stealing drugs yet?
-Nope.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.242
-Did you lock the gun up yet?
-Nope.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.454
If I leave my post,
I create an opportunity for theft.

13:08.538 --> 13:12.875
-When do you eat? When do you pee?
-Classified.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.169
-You're all idiots.
-Pretty much.

13:17.005 --> 13:21.550
Well, if you need me to bring you lunch
or a bedpan, let me know.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.018
12:38.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.312
I'll leave you two to fold the flag.

13:37.233 --> 13:41.487
Tough nut to crack, that one.
But so worth it.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.072
Couldn't agree more.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.200
Death kit.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.038
Shall we?

14:07.555 --> 14:11.141
Look how small. They used to be bigger.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.894
I mean, not huge,
but they covered everything.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.687
Sucks.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.735
May I have a word?

14:26.824 --> 14:31.745
What happened to the death kits?
Why are they so skimpy?

14:31.829 --> 14:33.455
Half the price, Miss Barkow.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.084
Yes, but now it takes two kits
to cover one body.

14:37.168 --> 14:40.629
-How's that saving anybody any money?
-Don't think so hard.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.300
Like I can help it.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.390
-You okay?
-Yes.

14:52.559 --> 14:56.186
-And why do people keep asking me that?
-Give me your hand.

15:01.734 --> 15:05.862
Reflexology, acupuncture,
stuff corresponding with other stuff.

15:07.949 --> 15:11.660
-What was that?
-Something's up with your uterus.

15:16.207 --> 15:19.376
-Am I gonna get my period?
-Couldn't tell you.

15:21.170 --> 15:26.091
-But, yeah, something is definitely...
-I know. Stop.

15:35.643 --> 15:40.480
-I'm on the phone with my attorneys.
-And I am buying chap stick for the queen.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.987
Hey, Mom. Can you put Mom on?
I have a legal question.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.699
Let's go. Get some gloves.

15:51.284 --> 15:55.412
80-year-old female, vital signs are stable,
altered mental status.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.790
-Undomiciled?
-No, smell coming in the hallway.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.835
Neighbors thought she was dead.
Called the cops.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.173
-I need you.
-Handle this.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.426
-May I help you?
-I need you to come to lunch with me.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.346
-I can't do it.
-Then I need you to kill Sam.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.473
-You're a big girl. Kill him yourself.
-I'm begging you.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.642
Please use your powers
as his direct superior.

16:16.726 --> 16:19.686
-Tell him to stop cruising doctors.
-You made your own bed.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.773
Yes, I know! But it was a one-night stand.
Not even.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.900
A bump in the chapel. And now he's...

16:27.820 --> 16:30.155
I hope by "big" you meant tall.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.621
Please stop looking at me.

17:28.589 --> 17:32.175
A lot of people. And Carolyn.
Carolyn comes for lunch.

17:32.260 --> 17:35.721
You know she comes...
We have lunch on Thursdays.

17:35.805 --> 17:39.433
But no, no wigs. No wigs.

17:39.976 --> 17:43.228
Sometimes, you know, she wears a fall.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.566
The hair is from China.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.902
What's up?

17:52.113 --> 17:55.490
She has a 24-hour caregiver
paid for by the State.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.452
I hope you are kidding.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.292
How we doing, Renata?

18:06.461 --> 18:11.631
Hello, sweetheart. How was the ride?
Good, I hope.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.134
How about something to eat?

18:14.635 --> 18:16.553
Should we wait for company?

18:16.637 --> 18:19.681
Well, it might be a while.
There's a lot of traffic today.

18:19.766 --> 18:24.603
Yeah, I forgot the traffic.
I keep forgetting that.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.233
Will you get the girl some coffee?

18:30.318 --> 18:32.527
-No, that's okay.
-I would love to.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.196
I will be right back, okay?

18:50.463 --> 18:52.088
-Hey, Kevin.
-Hey, babe.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.925
-Heads up. The car is out of commission.
-Really? What's up?

18:55.009 --> 18:56.259
The tech is looking at it right now,

18:56.344 --> 18:59.262
but I just didn't want
to throw you for a loop.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.848
Okay. You good?

19:05.937 --> 19:07.687
This is delightful.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.359
-Thank you.
-My pleasure. Our pleasure.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.323
It says here
you have someone who lives with you?

19:22.328 --> 19:26.081
-My Carolyn comes for lunch.
-That's nice, huh?

19:26.165 --> 19:29.668
Tuesdays. Sometimes Thursdays.

19:30.545 --> 19:33.547
Or not. Busy lady.

19:33.631 --> 19:39.594
And her kids are beautiful.
And they're all blond, all of them.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.682
-Hello, dear.
-Hi.

19:44.559 --> 19:47.185
I saw her name on the computer.
Can I talk to her?

19:47.270 --> 19:49.479
Sure. Zoey?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.739
Renata Thurber.

20:00.575 --> 20:05.745
You did the hair for Mame,
and Follies and Company.

20:08.749 --> 20:09.916
I did.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.587
Are you one of the dancers?

20:15.506 --> 20:16.965
I'm an understudy.

20:25.892 --> 20:29.394
God. Why bother getting old, you know?

20:30.438 --> 20:33.773
People forgetting you're even alive.
Or not caring.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.029
Having a baby
wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

20:39.113 --> 20:42.991
-At least when I'm old.
-There's lots of reasons to have kids.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.244
Just as many not to.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.750
I have two girls.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.714
That's all you're getting.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.976
Five minutes.

21:10.061 --> 21:13.730
-All right, give me one second.
-Not asking. Come with me.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.026
You and Sarah Khouri, really?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.740
Really.

21:23.824 --> 21:27.535
-You don't do anything half-assed, do you?
-Apparently not.

21:29.121 --> 21:33.083
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
You are pretty sophisticated.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.960
Keep telling me that.

21:35.586 --> 21:39.881
-So, when are we talking?
-On her way up to Washington.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.217
Only for a couple of days.

21:43.010 --> 21:46.054
I thought this was behind me. I really did.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.099
-And it's not.
-And it's not.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.852
Do I get to meet her?

21:55.189 --> 21:58.775
-Incoming.
-See you.

22:07.702 --> 22:11.371
Look, I think you're great,
but I really need to step away from this.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.334
-Understood.
-It was amazing, don't get me wrong,

22:16.419 --> 22:18.795
but having indiscriminate sex
when you're a sex addict...

22:18.879 --> 22:22.424
-Indiscriminate? You're hilarious.
-My girlfriend's back.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.137
So is mine.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.901
-Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
-Glad to help.

22:41.986 --> 22:45.071
And the whole good-looking thing,
more of a curse than a blessing.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.740
I can't even imagine.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.459
-What's up, boo?
-Don't.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.629
You're just shutting me down here.
What's with that?

23:01.714 --> 23:05.592
-'Cause I can just...
-No, no, no, nothing's with that.

23:13.267 --> 23:16.644
I think I'm pregnant. Happy?

23:17.980 --> 23:19.064
Wow.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.359
I am happy if you're happy.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.824
It's not with the guy I like. It's his brother.

23:31.952 --> 23:35.330
One less Jägermeister,
I might've ended up with the one I wanted.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.498
Yeah.

23:37.541 --> 23:41.795
-Staten Island barbecues.
-Yeah, they are the worst.

23:43.964 --> 23:48.176
If no one steps up to the plate,
I could be there.

23:48.552 --> 23:52.639
That's very sweet. Just weird.

23:57.812 --> 24:00.647
-I'm looking for Renata Thurber.
-Family?

24:01.232 --> 24:02.565
Caregiver.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.111
Why don't you have a seat?
We'll get you the release forms.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.869
The police are here for the gun.
They need a signature.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.330
-Where are they now?
-There's just one, Miguel took him...

24:17.414 --> 24:19.999
All right. I'll be back in a second.

24:50.865 --> 24:53.491
Are you out of your fucking mind? Go.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.210
Hey, can you come with me a second?

25:06.005 --> 25:08.464
I've got a call in
to Adult Protective Services.

25:08.549 --> 25:11.759
You're gonna want to take her in
for aggravated neglect and endangerment.

25:11.844 --> 25:15.471
-Who the hell are you?
-Jackie Peyton, nice to meet you.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.473
Wanna step over here, please
for a minute, ma'am?

25:17.558 --> 25:19.350
-You've got to be kidding me.
-No.

25:20.394 --> 25:21.603
Fraud. You can get her on fraud.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.730
We've still got
an unregistered firearm over here, huh?

25:23.814 --> 25:25.440
The guy cracked his head open.
He's not going anywhere.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.400
-If you say so.
-I do.

25:30.446 --> 25:32.280
Ma'am, please. You want to step over here?

25:37.203 --> 25:39.204
Hi, it's me.

25:40.915 --> 25:44.667
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry about all this.

25:46.795 --> 25:50.632
I'm tired and my back's all fucked up
and I'm sorry.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.135
You want to talk?

25:55.429 --> 25:56.638
Really?

25:57.681 --> 25:58.890
Me, too.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.626
-You are nuts.
-I am.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.006
You've got to toughen up.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.968
Says the lady
that picked Alice in Wonderland.

26:37.972 --> 26:39.847
I hear it's very good.
