WEBVTT

00:20.687 --> 00:21.688
Why are you wearing that?

00:21.771 --> 00:25.400
Because we are dick-deep
in some serious espionage, missy.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.569
Can't take any chances.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.529
Okay, but that outfit
makes you stand out more.

00:29.612 --> 00:31.698
-You ladies know what you'd like?
-Please. I'd love--

00:31.781 --> 00:32.907
Give us a minute, please.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.368
So, you know, and I know,

00:35.452 --> 00:37.287
and Payton knows
about Dede and the throuple,

00:37.620 --> 00:39.164
and he knows that we know that he knows.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.165
Yeah, right.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.542
Well, guess what I just found out

00:42.625 --> 00:43.960
from a dear friend

00:44.044 --> 00:46.212
who runs a certain city desk

00:46.296 --> 00:49.424
and gets real chatty
after a couple of martinis.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.844
Payton just sat down to lunch
with a reporter

00:52.927 --> 00:54.971
from the New York Times.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.473
Not Field & Stream,

00:56.556 --> 00:58.308

00:58.641 --> 01:00.393
So, what do you got for me?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.979
I presume this is about Senator Standish?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.022
Mm-hmm.

01:04.689 --> 01:06.232
All I can say is it's big.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.401
You can't tell me what it is?

01:08.818 --> 01:09.986
Just that it's coming.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.238
Save some space for a Sunday drop,

01:12.322 --> 01:14.240
get it online, and I guarantee you,

01:14.324 --> 01:17.327
it'll be the top of every newscast
when cameras roll Monday morning.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.454
That depends on what it is.

01:19.871 --> 01:20.789
Give me a hint.

01:20.872 --> 01:23.750
Health care? Campaign finance violation?

01:23.833 --> 01:26.169
More like the destruction
of a political icon.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.129
It'll be your exclusive.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.298
Sunday morning.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.801
If that story comes out,
Dede's career is over,

01:34.094 --> 01:35.470
which means my career is over.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.806
But I don't understand.
Did he tell her what it was?

01:38.139 --> 01:41.017
Well, the story hasn't dropped,
so either (a) he did,

01:41.351 --> 01:44.145
and they're sitting on the story
until they can confirm it's legit,

01:44.229 --> 01:45.688
-or (b)--
-[waiter] So, what'll it be?

01:45.772 --> 01:46.773
One minute, please.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.900
Please, can we order?
This place has a Michelin star,

01:48.983 --> 01:49.859
and I'm starving.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.278
-I can bring some charcuterie or--
-I said, one minute.

01:53.905 --> 01:57.742
...or (b) he didn't tell her what it was
because he's got nothing but your word,

01:57.826 --> 01:59.619
and he knows the Times is gonna need more.

02:00.036 --> 02:03.331
So he's trying to butter her up,
get her salivating until she comes to him,

02:03.414 --> 02:04.707
begging him to let her run it.

02:05.125 --> 02:11.131
Either way, we get a little time
to generate some countermeasures.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.842
Honestly, I'm just very hungry.

02:14.425 --> 02:15.343
Now...

02:17.178 --> 02:20.515
I'm having dinner
with the selfsame reporter...

02:21.850 --> 02:25.562
and I intend to quid pro quo
Payton's tiny little heinie.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.022
So I need to know
the details of that threesome

02:28.106 --> 02:29.274
you and Payton were in.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.069
Right. So, here's the thing,

02:33.361 --> 02:36.614
-um, I was looking through my diary and--
-You keep a diary?

02:36.698 --> 02:38.241
[chortling]

02:38.324 --> 02:40.869
I mean, good, in this particular instance.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.495
But who are you?

02:43.913 --> 02:46.124
I know the date
and approximately what time,

02:46.207 --> 02:48.042
but... that's kind of all I remember.

02:48.126 --> 02:48.960
Aah.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.545
-Are you kidding me?
-I was nervous.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.922
I had a martini
and I borrowed my mom's Xanax,

02:53.006 --> 02:55.341
and the details are kind of... fuzzy.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.343
[Hadassah] You better listen up
right now, missy.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.929
Your assignment is to sit down
with Payton,

03:00.471 --> 03:02.557
light a few candles, get him liquored up,

03:02.640 --> 03:05.727
flesh out the details, and get it on tape.
Got it?

03:05.810 --> 03:06.936
Yeah, okay.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.814
Wait, are you leaving?

03:10.273 --> 03:11.733
I can't afford to eat here!

04:49.289 --> 04:51.749
in an office that I cannot believe is his.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.210
You get the best office
when you start bringing the goods,

04:54.294 --> 04:56.629
and as far as I can tell,
I'm the only one doing that.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.881

05:13.062 --> 05:14.814
I understand
that the quality is very poor.

You have to, like, put your ear

05:16.357 --> 05:18.860
right up next to it
and listen to it a bunch of times.

05:19.193 --> 05:22.071
Not to worry, because I have a transcript.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.867
It all started when Dede walked
into Hadassah's office,

05:25.950 --> 05:29.078
shut the door,
and said something very unexpected.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.621
[Dede] Hadassah, we need to talk.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.373
William is back living with us.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.125
Neither Marcus nor I

05:34.208 --> 05:36.794
are willing to give him up,
and that's that.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.629
Now, I know
this is going to infuriate you--

05:38.713 --> 05:41.174
Infuriate? Oh, no, Dede,

05:41.632 --> 05:42.633
that's not the word.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.219
The word is... destroy.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.096
You are destroying me.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.017
I am a fucking puddle of water
on the floor.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.270
-You have wicked-witched me! [panting]
-I'm sorry, Hadassah, but we--

05:54.354 --> 05:58.316
Have you ever once thought for one second
about everything I sacrificed for this?

05:58.399 --> 05:59.984
For you? For your career?

06:00.068 --> 06:03.154
-Of course I have! You know that I have!
-Oh, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!

06:03.237 --> 06:05.365
-I have never had love in my life.
-Oh...

06:05.448 --> 06:06.282
No. No, no.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.786
Okay, that one year I was married,
but I never loved him.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.206
Do you know that I could have married
Peter Jennings in '84?

06:13.289 --> 06:14.665
-What?
-We had a torrid affair.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.042
He was the love of my life.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.001
But I said no.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.296
I gave it up for this life with you,
and I never once complained about it.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.756
That just came with the job.

06:21.839 --> 06:24.801
But you want to throw it all away
because you got that tickle in your loins?

06:24.884 --> 06:26.052
You know what? What about me?

06:26.135 --> 06:27.387
-What about you?
-You don't care.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.806
And you can't even see
how destructive you're being.

06:29.889 --> 06:30.890
Of course I care.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.558
-Know what?
-I'm not being destructive.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.643
You know what?

06:33.726 --> 06:36.104
All this time,
I'm the one who's been in the throuple.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.230
-What?
-You,

06:37.313 --> 06:38.231

06:38.773 --> 06:39.690
and your career.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.484
-What are you doing?
-Well,

06:41.651 --> 06:44.153
now you're the one
throwing the career away,

06:44.237 --> 06:45.530
so, thank you.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.865
I can finally...

06:48.866 --> 06:50.284
move on.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.080
-Please, Hadassah. Please, don't do--
-It's over! I quit!

06:58.084 --> 07:00.002
What are you talking about?
There are no bad ones.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.088
Mmm, agree. I just watched The Intern,

07:02.171 --> 07:03.881
and you know what? Great movie.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.134
[James] She wrote Father of the Bride.
Perfect film.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.554

The Reese Witherspoon one, totally good.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.722
It's 'cause people really wanna live
in those kitchens.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.349
Hold on. No way.

for her entire career.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.857

07:20.940 --> 07:21.816
Correct, bitch.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.695
with a tearful apology

07:25.778 --> 07:28.698
and a brand-new plot to destroy you.

07:29.657 --> 07:32.160
I realized something last night.
It's complicated,

07:33.619 --> 07:34.996
and something's gotta give.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.790
It's your personal life, not mine.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.085
And you're allowed to lead it
however you choose.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.632
I-- I really appreciate that.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.676
[Hadassah] If any of this gets out,

07:48.759 --> 07:53.848
it destroys 40 years' worth of hard work,

07:53.931 --> 07:55.516
-yours and mine.
-I know.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.351
So... [sighs]

07:58.895 --> 08:00.480
...I have come up with a plan

08:02.190 --> 08:03.816
that will keep William close to you

08:03.900 --> 08:06.819
and skirt any and all rumors about this...

08:08.279 --> 08:09.113
throuple.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.406
Okay.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.200
We pretend William and I are a couple.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.203
We've been secretly dating
for three years.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.079
I have a guy doctoring old photos,

08:17.163 --> 08:18.206
and a Page Six photographer

08:18.289 --> 08:20.708
who's going to catch us
going into my apartment tomorrow night.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.169
I've booked an interview
with Women's Wear Daily,

08:23.252 --> 08:26.339
where I'm going to talk about
why I kept it secret for so long

08:26.422 --> 08:28.758
and how women in May-September romances

08:28.841 --> 08:30.927
-shouldn't feel any shame--
-You mean May-December.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.094
Kiss my ass, Dede.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.888
May-November, at most.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.682
-Late November.
-Week before Thanksgiving, okay, bitch?

08:36.766 --> 08:37.975
[laughing]

08:39.060 --> 08:40.728
[Hadassah] Anyway, after that...

08:41.145 --> 08:43.147
anything comes out about a throuple,

08:43.606 --> 08:46.734
I mean, like-- particularly, just a rumor
or, I mean, no proof,

08:46.817 --> 08:47.818
no-- no photos...

08:48.486 --> 08:49.612
is going to seem like...

08:50.738 --> 08:51.739
[panting softly]

08:52.114 --> 08:53.741
...like a desperate, ageist

08:53.824 --> 08:56.702

08:57.662 --> 08:58.913
So, what do you think?

08:59.330 --> 09:01.958
I think you really do love me,

09:02.625 --> 09:03.543
don't you?

09:04.752 --> 09:05.628
Yeah.

09:06.837 --> 09:07.672
I do.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.507
Now, unfortunately,
that's all I can tell you,

09:09.590 --> 09:12.301
because that bitch who works
at the front desk switched her meds

09:12.385 --> 09:13.928
and destroyed my spy cam.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.973
[Dede] Because it's incredibly sexist,
that's all.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.016
That's what I'm--
That's what I'm talking about--

09:19.100 --> 09:20.518
I hate cats.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.480
-[thud]
-[parts clattering]

09:24.564 --> 09:28.109
Sure, I can get a little Statue of Liberty
wearing sunglasses in there soon,

09:28.192 --> 09:29.026
but for now,

09:29.110 --> 09:30.778
there's only two cats in play:

09:31.028 --> 09:33.322
one at Dede's house and one at Hadassah's.

09:34.782 --> 09:38.035
Now, there's still the matter of payment.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.453
We're already paying you.

09:39.537 --> 09:40.871
Where's my date with Infinity?

09:40.955 --> 09:43.541
She's agreed to meet with you
for five minutes next Friday.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.376
Good. You're all free to go.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.840
[Dede] So, I told her I...

09:51.424 --> 09:54.969
I couldn't agree to anything
until the three of us spoke.

09:55.052 --> 09:55.886
It's just...

09:56.596 --> 09:58.306
-That's her plan.
-[Marcus scoffs]

09:59.015 --> 09:59.932
So...

10:01.309 --> 10:02.727
what-- what do you think?

10:02.810 --> 10:04.312
Well, to start with, what do you think?

10:04.395 --> 10:08.107
I think it's a way for us to stay together
without having to break up,

10:08.190 --> 10:09.650
and... [breathes deeply]

10:09.734 --> 10:12.361
...quite frankly, it's humiliating.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.530
Now, that is what I think. Humiliating.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.199
How many mistresses have been
in and out of the White House

10:17.283 --> 10:18.743
in the past 200 years?

10:18.826 --> 10:20.536
It is hypocritical, it is unfair,

10:20.620 --> 10:21.829
-it is--
-And it's temporary.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.999
It's just through the election
and the VP pick.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.460
Once--
Once we're through with all that, we can--

10:27.543 --> 10:29.170
we can figure something else out.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.547
-I-- I don't--
-Well, Marcus, we--

10:31.631 --> 10:32.632
-No.
-[spluttering]

10:33.549 --> 10:34.425
I... [sighs]

10:35.176 --> 10:37.970
This is the hardest thing in the world.
I know, and I...

10:38.512 --> 10:42.850
Here. And I don't--
I don't like putting my career

10:42.933 --> 10:43.934
ahead of my life,

10:44.018 --> 10:45.895
but I also know

10:46.312 --> 10:49.690
that there is something great
for all three of us

10:49.774 --> 10:53.110
on the other side of the horizon
if we can just stick it out

10:53.194 --> 10:54.278
until we get there.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.696
[Marcus] Okay. Okay.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.198
There you are.

10:57.281 --> 10:58.616
Sorry I'm late.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.618
-We good?
-Yeah.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.496
-Hello, darling. I missed you.
-Hi.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.873
So this is how it's going to go.

11:08.376 --> 11:11.420
William and I are going to leave.
There's paparazzi at the apartment.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.839
We're gonna tell them
we spent all day bird-watching,

11:13.923 --> 11:15.007
which you got me into,

11:15.091 --> 11:18.219
and then we went out
and bought matching workout clothes

11:18.302 --> 11:21.847
for SoulCycle, which I got you into.
Got it?

11:22.390 --> 11:26.060
Oh, marvelous. Okay. Well, gotta go.
[chuckles]

11:26.894 --> 11:28.354
Here we go. Come on, Sasquatch.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.480
-[William] Now?
-Yep.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.608
Damn. Where is that guy?

11:33.025 --> 11:34.235
-I'm freezing my ass here.
-I--

11:34.318 --> 11:36.404
-You can't count on anybody anymore.
-This is stupid.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.490
-[William] Oh!
-Oh! No! No photos, please!

11:39.573 --> 11:43.661
-Hadassah, are you two a couple?
-You know what? I'm so sick of you vermin.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.413
Yes, okay? We are!

11:45.496 --> 11:47.748
We've been dating for three years, okay?

11:47.832 --> 11:49.834
Now, please, just leave us alone.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.421
Really great work back there, deaf-mute.

11:54.338 --> 11:57.842
-[door shuts]
-Home sweet home. Kitchen, my room,

11:58.092 --> 11:59.343
view of Central Park.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.095
-Where's my bedroom?
-Oh.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.639
Your bedroom's right here,
within the imaginary walls

12:03.723 --> 12:05.808
that directly abut this sofa.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.935
Okay. I just thought it'd be
a little bit bigger.

12:08.018 --> 12:10.521
Well, I'm sorry.
I grew up a working-class kid

12:10.604 --> 12:11.731
in Paramus, New Jersey,

12:11.814 --> 12:14.150
and I possess a certain trait
called thrift,

12:14.316 --> 12:18.279
which means that I prefer
a smaller jewel box of a home

12:18.404 --> 12:19.655
that I can actually afford.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.073
-Now, good night, sweetheart.
-Ooh!

12:21.157 --> 12:22.074
Love you to bits.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.076
-You're angry.
-[sighs]

12:25.202 --> 12:28.205
I just don't like to be excluded,
that's all.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.250
To be on the receiving end
of a very elaborate lie.

12:31.667 --> 12:32.501
I get it.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.170
And I'm sorry we hid it from you

12:34.253 --> 12:36.964
and that you found out the way you did.
That would've been really hard.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.925
If it's any consolation,
you're handling it better than I would've.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.137
-Well, I-- I appreciate that.
-It's okay.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.764
-I'll get you a duvet.
-Okay.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.519
-[muted sirens wail in distance]
-[soft knock at door]

12:51.020 --> 12:52.062
[William] Hadassah?

12:55.357 --> 12:57.401
-May I help you?
-Yeah, so, um...

12:58.486 --> 12:59.653
do you have a night-light?

12:59.737 --> 13:01.739
No. No, I don't have a night-light.

13:01.906 --> 13:05.618
Okay, 'cause this is embarrassing.
Um, I'm kind of afraid of the dark.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.536
That's weird,
I'm working through it in therapy.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.955
[sighs] Just turn on the lights.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.082
No. But see, I can't sleep
in full light either.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.709
I need the room to be dim but not dark.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.086
Turn on the phone,
the flashlight on your phone.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.255
I tried that. It doesn't work.
It feels like a tiny man

13:18.339 --> 13:20.716
with a flashlight pointed at me
is standing there and staring.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.468
[knocking at door]

13:22.551 --> 13:23.511
[William] Hadassah.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.057
-What?
-Can I just sleep in your bed?

13:28.140 --> 13:29.892
[gasps] What? Are you crazy?

13:29.975 --> 13:32.144
I'm not used to sleeping alone.
It's part of the problem.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.939
The fear of the dark thing
totally goes away if I'm with someone. I--

13:35.022 --> 13:36.607
[both sighing]

13:37.233 --> 13:39.026
Okay, how about this?

13:39.401 --> 13:42.321
You grab your duvet.
You can sleep on the floor.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.281
[chuckles] Oh, my God, thank you so much.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.700
Hey, you go back to bed,
and I'll get myself situated, okay?

13:57.294 --> 13:59.421
Not at the foot of the bed.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.965
You're not my dog.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.424
Lay over here.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.843
[William] Okay, thank you.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.517
So, and this is the last thing, I promise.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.688
-What?
-Shouldn't we get to know each other?

14:15.771 --> 14:17.606
If we've been dating for three years?

14:18.482 --> 14:19.942
Like, if somebody asks us?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.112
And you want to do this right now?

14:23.821 --> 14:25.656
Well, I don't know. Paramus, huh?

14:26.365 --> 14:27.199
Was it nice?

14:27.283 --> 14:28.409
Like Paris.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.244
[chuckles softly]

14:30.661 --> 14:31.704
It was all right.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.248
We didn't have much.
My father was a butcher.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.959
So we never went hungry. What about you?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.294
Well, I was a twin.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.837
Oh, my God, there are two of you?

14:39.920 --> 14:42.256
No, he died when I was three days old.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.549
Jeez, I'm so sorry.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.759
Oh, that's horrible. I'm sorry.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.013
It's okay. It's okay. Obviously,
I don't remember him, but, um...

14:51.015 --> 14:53.726
but they say that everything
that happens to you before you turn three,

14:54.226 --> 14:55.895
that's how your emotional life is shaped.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.814
So, you actually do remember it,

14:58.898 --> 15:00.608
just in a different way.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.610
I never heard that before.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.115
[both laughing]

15:08.532 --> 15:10.242
You-- You're shitting me!

15:10.326 --> 15:12.870
So, I forgot my lines,
and I'm standing there out onstage,

15:12.953 --> 15:15.581
so I just start saying lines
from a different musical.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.082
[laughs hysterically]

15:17.166 --> 15:18.751
I can't! I can't!

15:18.834 --> 15:20.628
Yeah, no,
suddenly Tevye up there's singing

15:20.711 --> 15:22.796
about how there's gonna be trouble
in River City.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.924
Oh, God, I gotta pee!

15:25.007 --> 15:27.301
And then the pit band
starts playing along, and...

15:27.384 --> 15:29.511
-[Hadassah laughing hysterically]
-[alarm rings]

15:29.595 --> 15:31.513
[Hadassah coughing]

15:32.723 --> 15:33.682
[William] Okay?

15:34.058 --> 15:36.602
-You're okay.
-Oh, Lord. Oh, I cannot believe that.

15:37.227 --> 15:40.981
I have never laughed like that in my life.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.734
-And now it's time to go to work! I--
-[laughing]

15:45.027 --> 15:46.487
-[William chuckles]
-[laughs, sniffs]

15:46.570 --> 15:47.404
Oh, God.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.323
I'm so glad we did this.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.574
Oh, gosh, me too.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.825
No, I-- I mean, I...

15:52.785 --> 15:54.912
I'm-- I'm glad we're-- we're doing this.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.538
[William] Yeah.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.040
This is fun.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.417
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:03.587 --> 16:06.173
Okay. I'm gonna shower first,
and then you, okay?

16:06.256 --> 16:07.174
[William] Okay.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.306
What if it's a snow-cone truck,
but then when you go to lick it,

16:14.390 --> 16:17.434
it's dry ice, and it starts melting,

16:17.518 --> 16:19.395
and the cups say,
"Remember when there was ice?"

16:19.478 --> 16:22.147
First of all, dry ice doesn't melt,
it sublimates.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.400
And if you lick dry ice,
you'll burn your tongue.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.693
-We'll get sued.
-[Skye] James,

16:25.776 --> 16:27.319
there's no "no" in a brainstorm.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.363
Fine,
then let's keep pitching insane ideas

16:29.446 --> 16:31.573
about having a rally
about how hot the planet's getting

16:31.657 --> 16:32.992
when it's fall and freezing.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.411
Would you please stop spouting
right-wing talking points

16:35.494 --> 16:37.913
that deliberately confuse weather
with climate, James?

16:37.997 --> 16:41.458
I guess I'm having trouble getting it up
for an issue that is not a priority

16:41.542 --> 16:43.711
for voters in this district
or the country at large!

16:43.794 --> 16:46.088
Payton is finally passionate
about something.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.923
We need voters to see that, okay?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.883
It doesn't matter
what the issue actually is.

16:49.967 --> 16:50.926
[James] Okay, fine,

16:51.010 --> 16:52.052
snow cones it is.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.804
I can't wait to go out
in the freezing cold

16:53.887 --> 16:55.889
in my overcoat
and lick tongue-burning dry ice

16:55.973 --> 16:57.016
and then hit the ER.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.018
Okay, time-out.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.813
Everyone's getting hangry.
What are we gonna do for lunch?

17:02.896 --> 17:04.648
-[McAfee and James] Pizza.
-What kind?

17:04.732 --> 17:05.816
-Barbecue chicken.
-Hawaiian.

17:05.899 --> 17:07.484
-No, barbecue chicken.
-No, Hawaiian.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.444
I'm fine with that.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.903
[James] "I'm fine with that" means

17:09.987 --> 17:11.905
"I also think barbecue sauce
on pizza is disgusting,

17:11.989 --> 17:14.616
so I'll just quietly eat
all of James's pizza,"

17:14.700 --> 17:16.452
and then I'll get, like, one slice.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.746
Dude, you did not just make a comment
on my eating habits.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.497
[McAfee sobbing]

17:20.581 --> 17:23.000
[McAfee]
It's not what you think. Nobody died.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.252
Let me rewind a second to my life
one year ago.

17:25.335 --> 17:28.130
Yes, I was busting my ass
to graduate Columbia early.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.340
Yes, I spent most of my time studying,

17:30.424 --> 17:31.550
but I had hobbies.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.260
I had an exercise routine.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.721
Most importantly, I had a bunch of friends

17:36.096 --> 17:37.097
and a bunch of dates.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.349
Did I keep these mostly women
but also some guys

17:39.433 --> 17:41.602
at arm's length
because I didn't want anything serious?

17:41.685 --> 17:42.603
Yes.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.605
-But my full life felt full.
-Fuck that.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.981
-Fuck you!
-I had balance.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.275
Last year, James was a junior at NYU.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.903
He got really good at squash,
which was so weird.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.031
He got really
into the underground punk scene.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.993
He had a relationship with a CPA
who looked exactly like Alice

17:58.077 --> 17:59.661
that he ended pretty quickly,

17:59.745 --> 18:01.205
but again, balance.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.667
Mmm. Okay, let's take a look
at your term paper.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.879
[McAfee] Skye was the firebrand on campus,

18:08.962 --> 18:10.756
where it sounds like
you're actually encouraged

18:10.839 --> 18:12.091
to date your professors.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.802
And she did some speaking engagements
at local high schools.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.345
I guess what I'm saying is,

18:17.304 --> 18:20.474
it doesn't matter how frustrated you get.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.352
Poisoning people just isn't the answer.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.938
[McAfee] She'd soon find herself
working for the man she poisoned,

18:26.021 --> 18:27.481
but again, balance.

18:27.564 --> 18:28.524
Fast-forward to now.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.860
We all started working for Payton
and fell into a super toxic dynamic:

18:31.944 --> 18:35.197
working, eating,
watching Netflix, passing out.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.783
This is every night.
That is why I'm crying.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.704
I don't get it. That's Kaley Cuoco.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.998
Yeah, she's on a date. [gasps, sniffles]

18:46.500 --> 18:48.377
Tomorrow, I'm going out.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.465
I'm going out to dinner,
and then I'm going to see a play.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.926
-That sounds great. What are we seeing?
-You're not invited.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.970
I am removing myself

18:58.053 --> 18:59.972
from this toxic friend triangle,

19:00.180 --> 19:02.683
and I am going on a date
with someone from Tinder.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.060
And then I'm going to have sex
with that person.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.479
Goodbye!

19:09.982 --> 19:11.817
[Astrid]
River's been gone for three years,

19:11.900 --> 19:13.610
and I still think about him every day.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.115
He was such a good person.

19:19.741 --> 19:20.576
Not like us.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.827
-No offense.
-Mmm.

19:22.703 --> 19:23.620
None taken.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.791
I think he thought
we were good people, though.

19:28.876 --> 19:32.045
I don't think I'll ever find anyone
who sees me like he saw me.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.507
I miss watching him shower
but mostly miss being loved

19:35.591 --> 19:36.675
and seen like that.

19:37.968 --> 19:38.886
[sighs softly]

19:39.178 --> 19:41.847
My shrink says
I haven't processed his death properly,

19:41.930 --> 19:44.850
but I think it's just 'cause
so much of my memory is so blurry.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.561
Had a pretty impressive drug problem
at the time.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.562
What were you on?

19:48.896 --> 19:50.814
Ambien, Xanax, Klonopin.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.026
The advantage of having a mother
who's always high on pills

19:54.109 --> 19:55.903
is she can never remember
how many she's taken,

19:55.986 --> 19:58.113
-so it's easy to steal from her.
-[Payton chuckles]

19:58.739 --> 20:01.366
Not that she wouldn't have just given them
to me, anyway.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.580
[Payton sniffs]

20:07.623 --> 20:09.291
I don't remember our threesome.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.667
Really?

20:12.336 --> 20:14.963
You seemed very present and into it.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.548
Faking it is my superpower.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.094
Will you tell me about it? In detail?

20:21.970 --> 20:23.555
Like, did we do it more than once?

20:24.348 --> 20:25.933
No, just the one time.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.354
We got a hotel room so we could be sure
no one disturbed us.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.982
We did some shots of Everclear
to calm down.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.068
We were all a little nervous.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.696
River suggested that we might loosen up

20:39.780 --> 20:41.531
if we danced to the Psychedelic Furs.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.492
As usual, he was right.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.494
[The Psychedelic Furs' "Heartbreak Beat"
plays]

20:45.577 --> 20:47.329
I think we both just wanted
to make him happy.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.208
And he seemed to really enjoy watching us,
so...

20:52.626 --> 20:53.627
I kissed you,

20:55.128 --> 20:56.672
and we were all making out on the bed.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.132
I was on top of you,

20:59.800 --> 21:02.386
-then he moved behind me.
-[Astrid] God, did he put it in your butt?

21:02.469 --> 21:04.054
I thought he was going to, but...

21:05.097 --> 21:05.931
he didn't.

21:06.014 --> 21:09.101
I think he was thinking about it,
but then I looked down at your face,

21:09.184 --> 21:11.812
and you suddenly got... really angry.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.605
[Astrid] Then what happened?

21:13.689 --> 21:16.275
Nothing. You locked yourself
in the bathroom.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.486
He knocked on the door for a few minutes

21:19.569 --> 21:20.529
until you let him in.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.615
You guys talked in there for a while,
and then...

21:24.491 --> 21:25.325
you both left.

21:26.910 --> 21:29.705
Wait, so no one actually had sex
that night? No penetration at all?

21:29.788 --> 21:30.706
No.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.376
They always say that's the problem
with a threesome.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.044
Someone always ends up in tears.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.547
That night, you and I both did.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.132
[Astrid] Why did you cry?

21:40.757 --> 21:43.927
I wasn't attracted to River in that way.
I just wanted to feel...

21:45.846 --> 21:47.014
close to him.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.141
You know, to feel...

21:50.809 --> 21:52.060
intimate with him.

21:53.186 --> 21:54.104
And...

21:56.273 --> 21:57.274
it didn't happen.

22:00.777 --> 22:01.820
Why'd you cry?

22:06.366 --> 22:09.369
All I know is that after that night,
I knew without a doubt...

22:09.453 --> 22:11.705
he loved you more
than he could ever love me.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.670
I threatened to out him.

22:19.629 --> 22:23.300
Even though I knew he wasn't gay, either.
I don't even think he was bisexual.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.721
That still haunts me.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.393
I want to believe
it had nothing to do with his suicide.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.067
I knew he wasn't gay.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.195
He just wanted to be close to everyone.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.407
And we just wanted to be close to him.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.037
So, I'm actually 37 points down now,

22:52.120 --> 22:55.165
which means that even if Dede Standish
were to die between now and the election,

22:55.248 --> 22:57.542
I probably still couldn't make up
the ground. So...

22:58.960 --> 23:00.629
what would you do? [sighs heavily]

23:06.676 --> 23:07.844
-I'm sorry.
-No, I--

23:07.928 --> 23:10.972
I just-- Don't you think
that being together would be the closest

23:11.056 --> 23:12.516
we could get to being with him again?

23:12.891 --> 23:13.975
He loved us both.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.772
He's gone, Astrid.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.321
-[whispers] Sorry.
-No.

23:30.450 --> 23:31.535
[Alice] I don't trust her.

23:32.577 --> 23:33.954
I didn't-- I didn't kiss her back.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.039
I know. I saw.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.625
-You've been following us?
-Following her,

23:38.708 --> 23:40.210
just like I've been doing all week.

23:40.710 --> 23:41.795
She's up to something.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.339
She keeps a weird schedule
and took a spin class with Hadassah.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.258
Do you think she's working
as a double agent?

23:46.883 --> 23:48.969
What did you two talk about tonight?

23:49.052 --> 23:51.096
Uh, the threesome that we had with River.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.474
-What about it?
-Uh, details.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.393
She said that
she didn't remember anything.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.562
Do you think that she's feeding dirt
to Hadassah?

23:58.770 --> 23:59.729
[Alice sighs]

23:59.813 --> 24:01.022
-Possibly.
-[Payton scoffs]

24:01.106 --> 24:05.152
Astrid has no moral center
or emotional permanence.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.528
Her allegiances lie

24:06.611 --> 24:08.905
with whoever makes her feel good
in the moment.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.032
She can't be trusted.

24:13.076 --> 24:14.911
She can only be managed.

24:15.203 --> 24:17.205
We need to begin an affair with her,

24:17.706 --> 24:19.124
at least until the election.

24:19.207 --> 24:21.585
She clearly lusts for you,
considering that goodnight kiss,

24:21.668 --> 24:24.463
and she's got major lady-boner vibes
for me, I can tell.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.465
Oh, God, you're brilliant.

24:26.548 --> 24:27.716
Okay. What's our next step?

24:27.799 --> 24:29.342
You just follow my lead.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.928
Now take me home
and make love to me immediately.

24:36.725 --> 24:37.726
[Alice sighs]

24:39.227 --> 24:40.061
[knocking at door]

24:42.230 --> 24:44.816
-McAfee?
-David, hi. Come on in.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.528
You actually look like your profile,
so, thank you.

24:49.404 --> 24:52.073
-Um, not a serial killer, right?
-Nope. You?

24:52.574 --> 24:53.700
No. Good.

24:54.075 --> 24:55.952
Um, would you like a glass of wine?

24:56.036 --> 24:57.037
[David] That'd be great.

24:57.245 --> 25:00.123
-Uh, I brought edibles. You want one?
-Yes, thank you.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.214
[phone chimes]

25:09.466 --> 25:10.509
[phone chimes]

25:11.718 --> 25:13.970
-Uh... So, what do you do?
-[phone chimes]

25:15.180 --> 25:18.350
I am chief strategist
for the Payton Hobart campaign.

25:18.892 --> 25:21.436
He's running against Dede Standish
for state senate.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.231
Cool. He's got his work cut out for him.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.567
I never understood
why states have senates.

25:27.859 --> 25:30.403
It makes sense on the federal level
but not for the states.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.613
-[chimes]
-I think all states

25:31.696 --> 25:33.698
should have a unicameral legislature
like Nebraska.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.450
-Pieces of shit!
-Whoa, what happened?

25:36.243 --> 25:37.827
My friends left the text chain.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.456
So, I'm in, like,
a super toxic relationship

25:41.540 --> 25:43.083
with some of my work friends,

25:43.166 --> 25:45.252
and so I was like, "You know what?
No, I'm gonna go see

25:45.335 --> 25:49.422
Studs Terkel's Working musical
with some hot guy," you.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.007
And then they go and do that.

25:51.424 --> 25:56.555
[chuckles] And I'm like, "Of course,
they're trying to control me,"

25:56.638 --> 25:59.683
so I am going to do one better...

26:00.809 --> 26:02.060
and block them...

26:02.602 --> 26:05.146
on... Instagram.

26:05.897 --> 26:06.815
[soft beep]

26:10.235 --> 26:12.529
So, what were you saying?
You're from Nebraska?

26:13.780 --> 26:14.823
No.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.908
-[McAfee] So what do you think?
-It's really good.

26:16.992 --> 26:20.078
It's kind of an interesting throwback
to that leftie, mid-'60s,

26:20.161 --> 26:22.414
you-are-what-you-do sort of thing.
It feels kinda dated--

26:22.497 --> 26:25.333
No way. Skye, what are you doing here?

26:26.585 --> 26:29.921
Seeing Studs Terkel's Working.
Same as you, evidently.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.798
Quit stalking me, okay? This isn't cool.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.426
Will you get me a beer
and tell me your name again?

26:34.509 --> 26:36.636
It's Susan.
You've asked me that three times tonight.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.974
I am not stalking you.
You didn't tell me where you were going.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.058
[James] What the hell?

26:42.142 --> 26:43.602
Wait, how did we all end up here?

26:43.685 --> 26:45.270
Been wanting to see this since it opened.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.772
No way.
That would be an insane coincidence.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.983
Not really. I mean, if there is a musical

26:50.066 --> 26:52.611
that three Democratic political operatives
all wanted to see,

26:52.694 --> 26:54.571
it would be Studs Terkel's Working.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.364
-So...
-Is this your date?

26:56.448 --> 26:57.699
-What's his name?
-Hey,

26:57.782 --> 26:59.284
-I'm--
-You don't get to know his name.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.953
Hey, so this show's, like, not very good,

27:02.037 --> 27:03.997
and it looks like
a lot of people are leaving.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.874
We should go to the front row
and sit together.

27:05.957 --> 27:09.044
No way. I am on a date. Come on.

27:13.673 --> 27:16.468
-Payton told me you tried to kiss him.
-I meant no offense to you, Alice.

27:16.551 --> 27:18.845
You were honestly the last thing
on my mind,

27:18.928 --> 27:20.513
-in a nice way.
-I don't care.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.476
Payton's charisma is my burden to bear

27:24.559 --> 27:26.227
as much as it is his.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.854
And I understand that most men

27:27.937 --> 27:30.482
with Payton's ambition need the attention

27:30.565 --> 27:33.151
and affection of more than one person.

27:33.234 --> 27:34.152
Still...

27:35.320 --> 27:36.780
Payton and I are a couple...

27:40.492 --> 27:44.371
which is why I think
if he's going to have sex with you...

27:45.664 --> 27:46.539
[chuckles softly]

27:46.831 --> 27:47.916
...I should be there.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.418
And if we are going to participate
in activities

27:50.502 --> 27:53.046
that could create negative headlines,

27:53.129 --> 27:56.299
we need to make sure
that all parties involved can be trusted.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.968
Payton and I trust you.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.722
And we would like to have sex with you.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.141
-You want to have sex with me?
-Yeah.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.477
I thought I was happy
with Marcus and Dede.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.853
I'm so special to both of them,

28:08.937 --> 28:11.231
but I didn't realize
until I was out of there

28:11.606 --> 28:13.483
and with someone without dual loyalty,

28:13.566 --> 28:16.194
someone who gave all the attention to me,

28:16.277 --> 28:17.612
just how lonely I was.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.031
I don't want to be
the favorite child anymore.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.574
I wanna be an only child.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.034
Are you saying I'm your mother?

28:23.118 --> 28:23.952
[laughs] No.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.371
Mmm. Um, I'm saying

28:26.454 --> 28:28.832
that you make me feel

28:28.915 --> 28:31.710
like I am the only person in this world.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.628
I want to make you feel that way too.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.380
Gosh, that's awful sweet, but...

28:36.881 --> 28:39.008
is that the only reason you want me?

28:39.092 --> 28:40.719
-This isn't just about me.
-[Alice] Mmm.

28:41.886 --> 28:45.098
I've told Alice
that you've been feeling a little bit...

28:45.807 --> 28:46.641
vulnerable.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.519
You've been struggling,
and we want to be there for you.

28:49.602 --> 28:52.439
Okay, I can dig it.
But I have some ground rules.

28:53.314 --> 28:54.274
No eye contact.

28:55.024 --> 28:56.443
No kissing after oral,

28:57.402 --> 28:59.529
and dirty talk is encouraged,
but nothing vulgar.

28:59.612 --> 29:00.697
Anything else?

29:00.780 --> 29:03.366
We leave the bathroom light on
and the door open just a crack.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.326
I want enough illumination
to see what's going on

29:05.410 --> 29:07.537
but not so much
that I feel I'm performing Oh! Calcutta!

29:07.620 --> 29:10.165
-on the platform at Grand Central.
-Totally understand.

29:10.248 --> 29:13.710
Cuddle time after has to be
at least the duration of the act itself,

29:14.085 --> 29:16.921
and I'm not liable for any injuries
you may incur...

29:17.630 --> 29:19.048
physical or emotional.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.383
[Hadassah inhales sharply]

29:20.467 --> 29:21.718
-What, what, what?
-To be honest,

29:23.094 --> 29:24.471
it's been a while since I did this.

29:25.972 --> 29:27.223
I'm married to my job.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.392
I have been for years.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.395
I know, Hadassah.

29:32.479 --> 29:33.313
[Hadassah] Mmm.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.814
But for once in your life,

29:35.565 --> 29:38.234
let's make tonight all about you.

29:39.569 --> 29:40.737
[Hadassah] Oh...

29:41.905 --> 29:43.198
Mmm...

30:14.103 --> 30:14.938
[McAfee] Great.

30:15.021 --> 30:17.982
The new Morning Consult poll
has Payton down by 27 points.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.567
[David] Hey, thanks for tonight.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.652
It was nice meeting you.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.196
Uh, David, wait a second.
I'm-- I'm sorry about tonight.

30:23.279 --> 30:25.281
I was distracted kind of the whole night,

30:25.365 --> 30:27.575
-and that's on me.
-It's all good.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.411
Can I make it up to you
by inviting you up and then we have sex?

30:30.829 --> 30:32.789
Yeah. Sure.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.460
[McAfee panting]

30:38.419 --> 30:39.629
-[phone vibrating]
-Sorry.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.089
[phone chiming]

30:41.172 --> 30:43.132
-Okay.
-One sec. [grunts]

30:43.716 --> 30:45.301
-[phone chimes]
-Do you need to take that?

30:45.385 --> 30:46.719
Um, no, I'm just texting James.

30:46.803 --> 30:48.805
I-- I think I do remember him...

30:48.888 --> 30:51.724
[panting] ...saying that
he wanted to go see Working,

30:51.808 --> 30:53.893
which is probably what gave me the idea.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.854
So, that means
they weren't really stalking me.

30:55.937 --> 30:59.232
If anything, we were...
subconsciously stalking each other.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.150
And...

31:01.234 --> 31:03.945
-sent! Sorry.
-[phone chimes]

31:04.404 --> 31:05.446
Turning this off.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.991
So where are you from? Not Nebraska.

31:08.074 --> 31:09.325
[McAfee panting]

31:09.409 --> 31:11.744
-[James shouts outside] McAfee!
-Jesus, sorry!

31:11.828 --> 31:14.414
[James] Oh, my God. Are you there?

31:14.998 --> 31:16.916
McAfee, are you home?

31:18.918 --> 31:21.713
You guys, this is not cool. I'm on a date.

31:21.796 --> 31:22.755
Wait! He's up there?

31:22.839 --> 31:24.215
Yes! We're having sex!

31:24.299 --> 31:26.217
-[James] Is it good?
-You don't get to know that!

31:26.301 --> 31:27.218
Yes, I do!

31:27.302 --> 31:28.386
-Good night!
-[door buzzes]

31:28.469 --> 31:29.679
[Skye] I think he just left.

31:29.762 --> 31:31.222
[McAfee] Wait! Where are you going?

31:31.306 --> 31:33.266
You guys are really unhealthy,
you know that?

31:33.349 --> 31:35.602
Wait! Yes, I know! That's my whole point!

31:37.103 --> 31:38.146
So, can we come up?

31:39.564 --> 31:40.857
Eleven states.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.109
That's all I need.

31:43.192 --> 31:45.737
If I flip Texas and Georgia,

31:45.820 --> 31:48.573
and I eke out a win in Florida... poof...

31:49.240 --> 31:50.658
the other eight are easy pickings.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.911
I can still be president of all 50 states,

31:52.994 --> 31:56.039
just as long as I win.

31:56.122 --> 31:57.749
I'm just gonna come out and ask.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.711
Are you thinking of anyone else
for the VP slot?

32:02.086 --> 32:03.087
You heard something?

32:03.421 --> 32:08.176
No, no, but you're a transactional man.

32:08.718 --> 32:09.636
And...

32:10.595 --> 32:13.389
maybe you're seeing that you need
some more help in North Carolina,

32:13.473 --> 32:15.016
or maybe California even,

32:15.099 --> 32:17.018
and would want to pick a running mate
from there.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.440
You just take care of your senate race,

32:23.066 --> 32:25.068
and everything's gonna be fine.

32:26.569 --> 32:29.113
I think you're rethinking your offer.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.866
I don't judge it.
It's what I would be doing.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.451
But if you're gonna flip those states,

32:33.534 --> 32:36.329
you're gonna have to turn out the young
voters who've never voted before,

32:36.412 --> 32:38.164
and maybe you think that you need

32:38.247 --> 32:41.834
an exciting, younger woman
to help with that.

32:44.462 --> 32:45.797
You misjudge me.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.256
I don't blame you.

32:47.340 --> 32:51.594
I present an image
of a buttoned-up workaholic.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.766
And as a woman in politics,
I've had to do that,

32:57.392 --> 32:59.018
but I haven't been honest with you...

33:00.061 --> 33:01.354
about my personal life.

33:03.439 --> 33:06.734
For the last ten years,
I've been in a committed throuple

33:06.818 --> 33:10.196
with two men:
my husband and our partner, William.

33:12.073 --> 33:12.991
What?

33:14.784 --> 33:18.705
You said you had no skeletons
in your closet.

33:18.788 --> 33:22.583
I don't think it needs to be a skeleton.
I think we can use it to our advantage.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.836
Perversion doesn't sell in Peoria.

33:25.461 --> 33:27.463
It does if you're under 25.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.674
And that's the voting block
that you're going for.

33:29.757 --> 33:31.718
The kids now, they're fluid.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.970
They're polyamorous.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.848
They share rides, apartments, boyfriends.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.641
And let me tell you,

33:39.058 --> 33:44.897
women ages 45 to 70 will be saying,
"You go, girl"

33:44.981 --> 33:47.400
when they step into the voting booth
to vote for us.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.987
-I don't buy it.
-Well, you don't have to.

33:51.738 --> 33:55.366
Because I've had our pollsters conduct
a secret poll on the subject,

33:55.450 --> 33:58.786
and 62 percent of women over 40 have said

33:58.870 --> 34:00.329
that they are more likely to vote

34:00.413 --> 34:03.291
for a woman
who proudly owns her sexuality.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.961
It's the next level
in the women's empowerment movement.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.547
I can't believe Hadassah agrees with you
on this.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.923
She doesn't know I'm telling you.

34:11.257 --> 34:12.884
I'm tired of hiding in the shadows,

34:13.551 --> 34:14.886
not being who I am.

34:16.345 --> 34:17.805
I just need to know one thing.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.975
If I come out with this
and my numbers go up,

34:22.226 --> 34:23.311
what happens then?

34:29.484 --> 34:32.570
I don't give a rat's ass

34:32.904 --> 34:35.615
if you're screwing
the entire offensive line

34:35.698 --> 34:37.366
of the New York Giants.

34:37.700 --> 34:40.328
If your numbers are high, you're in.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.455
If they go down,

34:43.956 --> 34:46.918
then you and I have never met.

34:55.635 --> 34:56.594
So...

34:57.095 --> 34:58.012
[exhales sharply]

34:58.262 --> 34:59.305
...what's the skinny?

35:00.848 --> 35:01.724
Nothing.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.851
I can't remember a three-way
because there wasn't one.

35:03.935 --> 35:04.977
[Hadassah sighs]

35:05.520 --> 35:07.021
I know when someone's lying.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.149
Years of working in politics
have honed my sense of smell for liars.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.193
They give off a distinctive musk,

35:12.401 --> 35:15.655
and you reek like you've been bathing
in canard cologne.

35:15.738 --> 35:18.032
Believe what you wanna believe.
I'll keep spying for you.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.451
-I'll let you know if I hear anything.
-No, you won't.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.954
You're back with them... for now.

35:23.037 --> 35:25.289
You'll be back with me
as soon as they let you down

35:25.373 --> 35:28.084
or I offer you some shiny new thing
that distracts you

35:28.167 --> 35:30.294
from that black hole
where your heart is supposed to be.

35:30.837 --> 35:31.712
Yeah,

35:31.796 --> 35:34.257
I dug up the dirt on you, too, sweetheart.

35:34.882 --> 35:36.384
You're just like your mother,

35:36.467 --> 35:38.594
selling it to whoever's paying.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.471
You're fired as my mole.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.307
Take your Strawberry Shortcake backpack
out of here.

35:43.391 --> 35:46.477
Come back if you ever decide
who you actually are.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.317
-Where is he?
-In a cab,

35:53.401 --> 35:54.402
two minutes away.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.863
I can't believe I'm going to say this,

35:56.946 --> 35:59.991
but we haven't hung out properly in a day,
and I feel like I'm missing a limb.

36:00.074 --> 36:02.160
Can we please do dinner
and Friends tonight?

36:02.243 --> 36:03.911
-Yes, I would love that.
-That'd be awesome.

36:03.995 --> 36:04.912
[phone chirps]

36:05.204 --> 36:06.080
[laughs]

36:06.164 --> 36:10.001
Look at this from Astrid.
"Can the three of us do dinner tonight?"

36:10.585 --> 36:13.671
I was right. Astrid doesn't know
who she is or what she wants.

36:14.255 --> 36:17.633
If we keep her close, make her feel loved,

36:18.134 --> 36:19.927
-she's ours.
-[both chuckle]

36:20.011 --> 36:22.597
[Payton] And then our runway's clear
to drop the throuple bomb.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.848
I'm two steps ahead.

36:23.931 --> 36:25.266
I confirmed brunch with the Times,

36:25.349 --> 36:27.935
-Sunday at 11:00 at the Four Seasons.
-[sighs] Oh. I love you.

36:28.019 --> 36:28.853
[Alice moans]

36:29.729 --> 36:32.315
Once this gets out,
I'm the candidate with all the morals

36:32.398 --> 36:33.399
and all the momentum.

36:34.609 --> 36:35.943
-We'll win.
-Mmm.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.029
Go get 'em, tiger.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.155
[Payton] Whoo.

36:39.238 --> 36:41.240
[crowd cheering]

36:53.711 --> 36:57.340
[crowd] Payton! Payton! Payton! Payton!

36:57.423 --> 36:59.217
[chanting continues]

36:59.300 --> 37:00.635
[Payton] Yes, exactly, exactly.

37:00.718 --> 37:01.969
So, my friends, if you--

37:02.053 --> 37:04.889
if you want to see
this beautiful carousel submerged

37:04.972 --> 37:07.975
under four feet of storm surge
after the next big hurricane,

37:08.059 --> 37:10.019
well, then go ahead
and vote for Dede Standish.

37:10.102 --> 37:11.187
[crowd] Boo!

37:11.646 --> 37:14.607
If you want to see the ocean
emptied of fish

37:14.690 --> 37:17.944
and air unfit to breathe,
a sixth extinction on this planet,

37:18.027 --> 37:19.487
then I'll say it again, by all means,

37:19.570 --> 37:21.948
-vote for Dede Standish, right?
-[crowd] No!

37:22.031 --> 37:24.450
But, my friends, if the thing
that you want to see

37:24.533 --> 37:26.118
is a real sea change,

37:26.202 --> 37:27.995
a generational revolution

37:28.079 --> 37:29.664
in this city and in this country

37:29.747 --> 37:32.083
that will show the entire world
where our priorities lie

37:32.166 --> 37:35.503
and a bold, aggressive vision
for a better future,

37:35.586 --> 37:38.422
then I beseech you, give me your vote!

37:38.506 --> 37:39.465
-[cheering]
-Yeah!

37:39.548 --> 37:42.343
Please honor me with your vote,
and I will lead the way,

37:42.426 --> 37:45.179
because it is time
that we start investing in ourselves,

37:45.263 --> 37:48.849
and it is time
that we start investing in our future.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.559
Thank you very much for being here!

37:50.643 --> 37:51.769
[crowd cheering]

37:52.186 --> 37:53.104
[Payton] Thank you!

37:54.397 --> 37:55.690
[phone chimes]

37:56.357 --> 37:59.735
[crowd chanting] Payton! Payton! Payton!

38:01.696 --> 38:02.613
What? What is it?

38:02.697 --> 38:05.116
Don't know. Gotta get back.
Dede's gonna make an announcement.

38:05.199 --> 38:07.785
-[sighs] Shit. Okay, let's go.
-[Alice] That was perfect.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.997
Hi, I'm Dede Standish.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.873
After 30 years in public service,

38:12.957 --> 38:15.334
I realize there's a lot about me
that you know.

38:15.751 --> 38:19.005
But as a woman, well, lately I realized...

38:19.380 --> 38:20.840
that there's a lot you don't know.

38:22.008 --> 38:25.428
You know, we live in a culture
that makes assumptions about people

38:25.511 --> 38:27.388
based on stereotypes,

38:28.014 --> 38:33.102
well, outdated attitudes of race
and sexual orientation and gender,

38:33.185 --> 38:36.814
and more subtle ones
based on age and sex.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.567
And those stereotypes
are never more apparent

38:39.775 --> 38:41.861
than in a hard-fought political campaign.

38:41.944 --> 38:46.365
So I wanted to give you a little insight
into the Dede Standish

38:46.449 --> 38:48.868
who has been fighting
for the past 30 years

38:48.951 --> 38:51.537
tooth and nail
against the moneyed interests

38:51.620 --> 38:53.873
in the smoke-filled back rooms of Albany.

38:54.206 --> 38:57.877
I'm proud to say
that for the past ten years,

38:58.419 --> 39:03.883
I have been in a sexual relationship
with two different men.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.301
A throuple.

39:05.634 --> 39:07.136
Why am I telling you this now?

39:07.219 --> 39:10.514
Because I am so tired
of the political pundits

39:10.598 --> 39:13.225
and the mainstream media
making blithe assumptions

39:13.309 --> 39:15.019
about women who are over 50,

39:15.102 --> 39:16.604
as if our lives lacked the drive

39:16.687 --> 39:19.857
and the energy of people 20,
30 years younger.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.735
Well, all I have to say
is that women over 50,

39:22.818 --> 39:25.321
we are just hitting our stride,

39:25.404 --> 39:29.658
and it is more important now than ever
that our voices be heard, too.

39:29.742 --> 39:34.038
So for those of you who are feeling
now a little uncomfortable out there,

39:35.164 --> 39:37.917
all I want to say is, just chill out.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.087
Maybe it's time you got hip to

39:41.170 --> 39:43.464
what's really happening out there
these days.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.510
And to all my ladies of a certain age,

39:49.303 --> 39:50.930
you know what I'm talking about.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.349
I'm Dede Standish.

39:54.141 --> 39:59.397
It's been a long day of fighting hard
for the New York 27th,

40:00.106 --> 40:01.732
so if you'll excuse me,

40:02.691 --> 40:04.860
I'm gonna go let off a little steam.

40:06.112 --> 40:08.614
[announcer] Paid for by the Committee
to Reelect Leader Standish.

40:08.697 --> 40:10.366
[Payton] Uh, okay. Um...

40:10.449 --> 40:13.661
Reality check.
How did we not know this was coming?

40:13.869 --> 40:15.579
What about those freaking cats?

40:16.038 --> 40:17.706
All quiet on the cat front.

40:18.082 --> 40:21.460
-The hell does that mean?
-They're not nuclear-powered, dipshit.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.671
-Maybe the batteries ran out.
-[powering down]

40:23.754 --> 40:27.216
-And in regards to my date with Infinity--
-Stop. Stop talking.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.510
What just happened?

40:30.553 --> 40:32.680
I think she just lost the election.

40:34.557 --> 40:37.852
[all chuckling]

40:38.394 --> 40:39.395
[Dede gasps]

40:39.478 --> 40:41.772
Oh, my God!

40:42.940 --> 40:46.277
-I got a text from Oprah!
-[Marcus gasps]

40:46.360 --> 40:47.611
-The Queen herself?
-[Dede] Yes!

40:47.695 --> 40:48.946
-[Marcus] What does it say?
-Here.

40:49.029 --> 40:52.199
-"You go, girl."
-[Marcus] And you do.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.492
[Dede kissing Marcus]

40:53.951 --> 40:56.996
-Oh! Oh! I knew it. Oh.
-Thank you.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.666
We're up six points
since the throuple announcement.

41:00.749 --> 41:01.709
I knew it.

41:02.251 --> 41:04.295
Voters are tweeting about me. Wait.

41:04.378 --> 41:06.213
They say that I'm-- I'm relatable

41:06.464 --> 41:09.091
and real and sexy.

[cackling]

41:10.634 --> 41:13.053
Page Six was about to run that story
about William and me.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.389
You should've asked me
before you made that announcement.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.433
Why? Dede couldn't have pulled it off
any better.

41:17.516 --> 41:20.936
This is our life.
It's our choice to talk about it.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.189
True, and I agree, Dede was magnificent.

41:23.272 --> 41:27.067
What I take issue with is that she made
a public statement without all the facts.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.987
She has put herself very far out
on this throuple limb,

41:30.070 --> 41:34.658
which means she's at risk of someone
sawing that branch off behind her.

41:35.117 --> 41:37.786
-Who would do something like that?
-Me.

41:42.208 --> 41:43.459
-[Dede] Wha--?
-Um...

41:48.380 --> 41:49.215
I love you,

41:50.090 --> 41:51.008
I love you,

41:52.384 --> 41:55.304
but I'm never gonna be anything more
than a third wheel with the two of you.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.097
With Hadassah...

41:58.265 --> 41:59.600
well, um...

42:02.853 --> 42:04.230
I'm her one and only.

42:05.147 --> 42:06.065
Come here.

42:06.148 --> 42:07.942
How could you do this to us?

42:08.025 --> 42:10.069
The heart wants what the heart wants.

42:10.152 --> 42:12.154
But I won't let it get in the way
of the campaign.

42:12.238 --> 42:15.616
The three of you will continue to be
in the throuple while out in the world.

42:15.699 --> 42:18.786
I guess that sort of thing is what makes
for good politics these days.

42:19.119 --> 42:21.747
But behind closed doors, oh...

42:22.706 --> 42:24.583
this man is mine.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.129
[William] Come here, darling.

42:30.506 --> 42:31.465
After you.

42:35.302 --> 42:37.221
