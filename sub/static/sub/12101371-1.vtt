WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:04.383
(upbeat music)

00:09.593 --> 00:12.093
(crow cawing)

00:20.990 --> 00:23.823
(chatter from TV)

00:26.371 --> 00:28.642
- [Charlie Voiceover]
So you know murder now?

00:28.642 --> 00:31.475
(chatter from TV)

00:37.647 --> 00:40.428
Feels like you thought
it would, doesn't it?

00:40.428 --> 00:42.178
Even in self-defense.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.364
(Charlie sighs)

00:45.364 --> 00:47.911
You get your soul right, Charlie.

00:47.911 --> 00:49.752
It was him or you

00:49.752 --> 00:51.669
and he knew the stakes.

00:57.142 --> 00:58.059
$5 million.

00:59.007 --> 01:01.125
You just need to play a good end game.

01:01.125 --> 01:04.125
They always fuck up in the end game.

01:05.397 --> 01:09.181
Now, it's just a few hours
before you're in the cream.

01:09.181 --> 01:11.786
You'll both sit on the
beach, laugh, smash,

01:11.786 --> 01:13.124
and grow fat.

01:13.124 --> 01:13.967
(bell dings)

01:13.967 --> 01:16.607
(audience cheers)

01:16.607 --> 01:20.357
(indistinct chatter from TV)

01:41.478 --> 01:44.228
(phones ringing)

01:49.035 --> 01:51.788
You know these fools want some money.

01:51.788 --> 01:54.538
Nobody's just able to pay a debt.

01:57.996 --> 02:00.412
Fundamental law of being a bookie.

02:00.412 --> 02:02.513
Winners are as punctual as the sun,

02:02.513 --> 02:04.604
and losers come like an eclipse.

02:04.604 --> 02:07.513
(chatter from TV)

02:07.513 --> 02:10.096
(safe beeping)

02:19.647 --> 02:22.245
(door closes)

02:22.245 --> 02:24.078
Whoops, almost forgot.

02:26.245 --> 02:29.662
(door opens then closes)

02:33.829 --> 02:36.191
(Charlie sighs)

02:36.191 --> 02:39.364
Okay Charlie time to feed the vultures.

02:39.364 --> 02:41.438
(door opens then closes)

02:41.438 --> 02:44.438
(gentle jazz music)

03:49.529 --> 03:51.353
This job is cake,

03:51.353 --> 03:53.823
just got to stick to the rules.

03:53.823 --> 03:56.180
Pretend to be a little
miserable when they win.

03:56.180 --> 03:59.158
At least half as miserable
as they are when they lose.

03:59.158 --> 04:01.761
If you're not somewhat
blue on the sell up,

04:01.761 --> 04:03.820
people won't bet with you.

04:03.820 --> 04:07.499
Truth is, you don't care
whether they win or lose.

04:07.499 --> 04:09.000
You just a sub-book

04:09.000 --> 04:12.417
and liquidity, that's
a major-book's problem.

04:12.417 --> 04:16.250
(gentle jazz music continues)

04:20.952 --> 04:22.285
Tom, how's Kate?

04:23.234 --> 04:24.067
- Shit Charlie?

04:24.067 --> 04:25.258
What's up, baby?

04:25.258 --> 04:29.008
(voice drowned out by music)

04:39.763 --> 04:41.351
Okay nigga.

04:41.351 --> 04:44.768
You know what it's time for, collections.

04:46.047 --> 04:49.369
It's the worst part of the business.

04:49.369 --> 04:51.418
You love your bookie when you win

04:51.418 --> 04:54.588
but he killed your mother when you lose.

04:54.588 --> 04:59.091
I don't care if you're Bill
Gates, Bezos, or Buffet.

04:59.091 --> 05:02.674
Nobody likes to pay
down a lost bet, nobody

05:04.748 --> 05:07.127
and everyone likes to bet.

05:07.127 --> 05:10.748
Doctor, lawyer, cabby, cop
there's no typical gambler,

05:10.748 --> 05:12.988
just typical deadbeat.

05:12.988 --> 05:15.445
I mean, they can have
10 times the money owed

05:15.445 --> 05:16.565
in their back pocket,

05:16.565 --> 05:20.285
and still have the nerve to
look you dead in the eye,

05:20.285 --> 05:22.535
and say they're dead-broke.

05:23.923 --> 05:26.328
Man these assholes scatter like roaches

05:26.328 --> 05:28.161
when you come calling.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.041
Shit.

05:34.726 --> 05:39.024
Niggas jumping out of
windows, diving between cars.

05:39.024 --> 05:43.426
I had this one cat, quit
his job, change his name,

05:43.426 --> 05:46.889
and moved to Alaska over a 10K bet.

05:46.889 --> 05:50.139
Last I heard, he got raped by a walrus.

05:51.800 --> 05:54.428
Can you imagine a nigga hiding
out with the polar bears

05:54.428 --> 05:56.345
and shit over 10 grand?

05:58.195 --> 06:00.112
I understand it though.

06:02.106 --> 06:03.606
It's an ego thing.

06:05.157 --> 06:06.600
It really is.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.183
(upbeat music)

06:10.908 --> 06:11.922
(man screams)

06:11.922 --> 06:13.780
(toilet flushing)

06:13.780 --> 06:15.889
- What the fuck man!

06:15.889 --> 06:17.466
- Padre's won.

06:17.466 --> 06:20.502
You're down eight g's
we need to settle up.

06:20.502 --> 06:23.106
- You know I don't keep
a stack like that on me

06:23.106 --> 06:24.023
nigga damn.

06:24.930 --> 06:25.986
- Come on Blake.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.471
You're in the dope hustle,
you should be more liquid.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.418
- Yeah I lodged into a little of bad luck,

06:30.418 --> 06:32.621
put me down for fourth Sox.

06:32.621 --> 06:33.938
- You got jokes?

06:33.938 --> 06:35.105
- You know I got credit.

06:35.105 --> 06:37.306
You come in here, you use my house

06:37.306 --> 06:41.931
like I'm some kind of bad come
on, cut me some slack, Chuck.

06:41.931 --> 06:43.287
- If it was up to me, I'd lean easy

06:43.287 --> 06:44.857
but Big Slim?

06:44.857 --> 06:48.632
When it comes to debt, he
ain't exactly Mr. Bethlehem.

06:48.632 --> 06:49.893
He gon' let you slide,

06:49.893 --> 06:51.773
he ain't gon' let you slip.

06:51.773 --> 06:54.069
- Yeah what's big rush?

06:54.069 --> 06:56.133
- It'd be about 850.

06:56.133 --> 06:59.166
- All right well, let
me move some shit around

06:59.166 --> 07:01.680
I'll have it to you by Sunday.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.497
Now can I finish my shower?

07:03.497 --> 07:04.414
Nigga damn!

07:06.620 --> 07:09.203
(men mumbling)

07:14.536 --> 07:15.690
- Okay hit this one,

07:15.690 --> 07:16.796
and the one in mid city,

07:16.796 --> 07:19.572
and transfer the bread
to the one in Inglewood.

07:19.572 --> 07:21.973
Maybe hit the one in K-Town.

07:21.973 --> 07:24.335
Goddamn paranoid, Charlie

07:24.335 --> 07:26.599
but better paranoid than in prison.

07:26.599 --> 07:28.349
- Hey you want a dab?

07:29.601 --> 07:30.948
- A what?

07:30.948 --> 07:31.781
- A dab.

07:33.634 --> 07:36.695
It's like free basin' but with weed baby.

07:36.695 --> 07:39.448
- You know I don't fuck
with that reefer shit.

07:39.448 --> 07:42.055
- Could you sound more like a cop?

07:42.055 --> 07:45.604
And we got to talk about
the terminology, bro.

07:45.604 --> 07:46.437
Reefer?

07:46.437 --> 07:48.567
What is this Dragnet?

07:48.567 --> 07:51.051
Nobody calls it reefer anymore grandpa.

07:51.051 --> 07:52.967
- Don't you know the fourth commandment?

07:52.967 --> 07:55.330
Never get high off your own supply?

07:55.330 --> 07:56.171
- I grow.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.254
Nigga I am my own supply.

07:59.388 --> 08:01.087
- I don't understand how
you get anything done

08:01.087 --> 08:02.912
smoking that shit all day.

08:02.912 --> 08:06.659
- I can damn blaze my way through dumb.

08:06.659 --> 08:08.409
Don't worry about me.

08:09.253 --> 08:11.472
- I always worry about the
people that owe me money.

08:11.472 --> 08:13.657
Call me sentimental.

08:13.657 --> 08:15.355
I'll be by Sunday for the vig

08:15.355 --> 08:16.887
after the game.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.832
- Hey put me down for three on the Sox.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.213
- Not until we're square.

08:20.213 --> 08:24.032
(door opens then closes)

08:24.032 --> 08:26.865
(chatter from TV)

08:28.838 --> 08:31.921
(car engine roaring)

08:39.591 --> 08:41.416
(phone ringing)

08:41.416 --> 08:43.833
(soft music)

08:45.811 --> 08:46.934
- What's up, Chuck?

08:46.934 --> 08:50.410
- I need some exact numbers
on that Gobachor fight.

08:50.410 --> 08:54.053
- Hang on let me pull up the sheets.

08:54.053 --> 08:57.366
Okay, it looks like you
got seven up for collection

08:57.366 --> 08:59.828
and nine for payouts.

08:59.828 --> 09:01.205
Spreads a little lean,

09:01.205 --> 09:03.887
but over all the book's balanced.

09:03.887 --> 09:05.885
- Yeah I already squared Blake and Tom.

09:05.885 --> 09:10.078
All right who's next on the collect list?

09:10.078 --> 09:12.225
- Your favorite, Mr. Boom Boom,

09:12.225 --> 09:13.558
Hyman Steinberg.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.868
- All right let me have his
exact balance including vig

09:16.868 --> 09:18.368
and the principal.

09:20.807 --> 09:24.193
- Looks like he needs to make
a payment of at least 6,500

09:24.193 --> 09:25.903
to square off his vig.

09:25.903 --> 09:27.343
But he's late

09:27.343 --> 09:29.343
and his grace period is,

09:32.489 --> 09:34.656
well ain't that some shit!

09:35.567 --> 09:38.145
- Hey what some shit?

09:38.145 --> 09:41.014
- I'm looking at his
credit card statement,

09:41.014 --> 09:45.184
and it looks like he bought
some plane tickets to Thailand.

09:45.184 --> 09:46.851
He's leaving Monday.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.770
- Motherfucker!

09:50.843 --> 09:52.301
God damn it, Hyman.

09:52.301 --> 09:55.051
(Charlie grunts)

09:58.038 --> 09:58.871
- Rude.

10:08.030 --> 10:11.863
(car door opens then closes).

10:15.928 --> 10:17.436
- [Charlie Voiceover] Mr. Boom Boom

10:17.436 --> 10:19.103
aka Hyman Steinberg.

10:21.202 --> 10:23.153
Sergeant of arms has been in bed with me

10:23.153 --> 10:27.769
since I started my first
book right after prison.

10:27.769 --> 10:29.381
We've always cut him some slack

10:29.381 --> 10:33.100
because he was a big operator
that made terrible bets.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.600
15 stacks at a time.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.761
What are you going to do?

10:36.761 --> 10:38.285
He's a whale.

10:38.285 --> 10:39.864
He's gotten into some deep holes,

10:39.864 --> 10:41.544
but he's always paid down,

10:41.544 --> 10:42.377
always.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.227
But leaving town $67,500 owed?

10:50.153 --> 10:51.820
What's going on, Hy?

10:53.300 --> 10:56.656
(door opens then closes)

10:56.656 --> 10:59.489
(chatter from TV)

11:00.896 --> 11:03.613
- Now it all fades to
black, you punk Kushim.

11:03.613 --> 11:05.958
- (sighs) Kushim?

11:05.958 --> 11:08.958
Racism, hi a Jew should know better.

11:10.118 --> 11:12.736
- What you speak Hebrew now?

11:12.736 --> 11:16.235
- No nigga just sounds the
same in every language.

11:16.235 --> 11:18.510
Now can we please put
the pocket tank away, Hy.

11:18.510 --> 11:20.777
- I'm sorry I was just joking.

11:20.777 --> 11:21.878
No offense.

11:21.878 --> 11:24.689
- Well them jokes I can forgive okay?

11:24.689 --> 11:26.892
But this debt not so much.

11:26.892 --> 11:29.035
- Yeah don't worry about it.

11:29.035 --> 11:32.533
- We need to talk about
your accounts, Hy okay?

11:32.533 --> 11:35.933
With your last bet, your
over 67 stacks in the red.

11:35.933 --> 11:37.993
You're gonna need a settlement

11:37.993 --> 11:40.745
'cause Big Slim, he's getting kind of hot.

11:40.745 --> 11:42.446
- I'll pay it tomorrow.

11:42.446 --> 11:44.339
- Well see that's the thing.

11:44.339 --> 11:45.422
A little bird tells me

11:45.422 --> 11:48.126
that you got plane tickets to Thailand.

11:48.126 --> 11:49.585
Now an impromptu vacation while you're

11:49.585 --> 11:53.045
this deep in the books,
Hy that don't look good.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.497
If word gets out that you skipped odds

11:55.497 --> 11:57.528
well, Big Slim Fizz

11:57.528 --> 12:00.263
he's gonna have to put
word in to Horse Dick Jimmy

12:00.263 --> 12:01.096
and--

12:01.096 --> 12:03.221
- That's not necessary.

12:03.221 --> 12:04.240
Okay?

12:04.240 --> 12:06.288
Why you gotta bring him into this?

12:06.288 --> 12:07.766
- Look, paying off the vig

12:07.766 --> 12:10.001
ain't enough to let you
leave the country, Hy.

12:10.001 --> 12:12.522
- I'll pay it tomorrow with interest.

12:12.522 --> 12:13.547
Not a problem.

12:13.547 --> 12:16.380
(chatter from TV)

12:18.150 --> 12:19.400
- Okay $67,515.

12:21.725 --> 12:23.411
That's not a problem?

12:23.411 --> 12:25.489
- Let's make it 77.

12:25.489 --> 12:28.322
(chatter from TV)

12:33.651 --> 12:35.976
- What's going on, Hy?

12:35.976 --> 12:37.578
- I'm retiring.

12:37.578 --> 12:38.661
In a cashout.

12:39.733 --> 12:42.068
Move to Chiang Mi, Chiang Mai,

12:42.068 --> 12:43.870
whatever the fuck they call it.

12:43.870 --> 12:46.016
- Okay what'd you sell
a tank or something?

12:46.016 --> 12:47.955
- Tanks are cheap.

12:47.955 --> 12:49.955
You can't make 5 million with tanks.

12:49.955 --> 12:51.038
- Five rocks?

12:51.949 --> 12:55.032
Dude how'd you pull down
that type of scratch?

12:55.032 --> 12:56.429
- Don't worry about it.

12:56.429 --> 12:58.887
- Come on, come on buddy.

12:58.887 --> 13:00.595
Come on what is it, huh?

13:00.595 --> 13:01.428
What is it?

13:01.428 --> 13:02.261
It's a horse, right?

13:02.261 --> 13:04.014
You got a hot tip on a horse right?

13:04.014 --> 13:05.348
Come on man what's the angle?

13:05.348 --> 13:07.347
- It's not a horse.

13:07.347 --> 13:11.430
- Okay I know it's not
guns the market's flooded.

13:17.102 --> 13:20.269
- Come here let me show you something.

13:22.160 --> 13:25.743
(piano keys play randomly)

13:30.823 --> 13:31.936
Remember the Beatles?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.102
- Yeah.

13:33.102 --> 13:35.555
- Give me a hand with this stuff.

13:35.555 --> 13:37.621
They started out a boy band.

13:37.621 --> 13:41.409
Cover songs, bad haircuts,
it was nauseating.

13:41.409 --> 13:43.445
And then one three letter word

13:43.445 --> 13:47.143
made them the best band in the world.

13:47.143 --> 13:47.976
LSD.

13:48.969 --> 13:49.864
- What is it?

13:49.864 --> 13:51.114
- $4.8 million.

13:54.412 --> 13:57.049
- This shit is worth five rocks.

13:57.049 --> 13:58.796
- 4.8 bubby.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.216
- Jesus.

14:00.216 --> 14:03.584
- He might have been a
mushroom, but not an acid trip.

14:03.584 --> 14:06.019

14:06.019 --> 14:08.595
- When you get caught with
that, you're doing life.

14:08.595 --> 14:10.537
That shit made hippies out of people.

14:10.537 --> 14:12.611
Uncle Sam won't let that slide.

14:12.611 --> 14:14.724
- Why are you showing this to me, Hy?

14:14.724 --> 14:16.208
This is kill people money.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.808
- I'm a gun runner.

14:17.808 --> 14:20.860
Only idiots would rob a gun store

14:20.860 --> 14:23.136
and only devils would rob friends

14:23.136 --> 14:25.024
you're neither.

14:25.024 --> 14:26.227

14:26.227 --> 14:28.144
I'm happy for you, man.

14:29.041 --> 14:31.122
- You're a fair bookie, Charlie.

14:31.122 --> 14:34.057
I'll remember that tomorrow

14:34.057 --> 14:35.323
I got a bonus for you.

14:35.323 --> 14:37.572
- (chuckles) that won't be necessary, Hy

14:37.572 --> 14:39.108
Of course I will take it.

14:39.108 --> 14:40.826
- Come on let's have a drink.

14:40.826 --> 14:43.318
- No, I got plans this evening

14:43.318 --> 14:46.150
but look, I will be by tomorrow okay?

14:46.150 --> 14:48.567
And Hy, that is $67,000 cash.

14:50.387 --> 14:51.387
- Yeah yeah.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.182
Hey, how about an uzi.

14:56.182 --> 14:58.515

15:05.699 --> 15:08.427

15:08.427 --> 15:09.846
time to check in with the boss

15:09.846 --> 15:11.808
Big Slim Fizz.

15:11.808 --> 15:12.641
(upbeat music)

15:12.641 --> 15:15.724
(footsteps plodding)

15:19.048 --> 15:19.881
(sighs)

15:19.881 --> 15:22.894
Okay let's get ready
to see some weird shit.

15:22.894 --> 15:26.097
He say he got the taste in jail.

15:26.097 --> 15:26.930
Bullshit.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.148
I mean, I did time too,

15:31.148 --> 15:32.249
but I didn't come out of the joint

15:32.249 --> 15:33.529
with more sugar in my shoes

15:33.529 --> 15:37.779
than Willy Wonka moon-walking
through a cane field.

15:39.284 --> 15:41.246

15:41.246 --> 15:44.163

16:38.386 --> 16:40.352
- There he is.

16:40.352 --> 16:41.685
What's the news?

16:42.910 --> 16:45.145
- You got a couple
payouts still coming in.

16:45.145 --> 16:47.305
A couple collections went
straight to voicemail.

16:47.305 --> 16:48.138
- Okay.

16:49.220 --> 16:51.303
(laughs)

16:53.904 --> 16:57.233
Is there anybody we
need to (taps on elbow)?

16:57.233 --> 16:59.066
- No not yet at least.

17:00.097 --> 17:04.593
But Hyman did mention he plans
on paying off his entire debt

17:04.593 --> 17:06.422
in full by tomorrow.

17:06.422 --> 17:07.255
- In full?

17:08.502 --> 17:12.318
So where is old boy pulling
that kind of bread, Chuck?.

17:12.318 --> 17:13.366
- No idea.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.264
I try not to ask questions

17:15.264 --> 17:17.366
as far as where these whales,

17:17.366 --> 17:18.339
in which hats they're pulling

17:18.339 --> 17:20.172
their little bunnies out of.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.922
It's a liability thing, you know?

17:26.330 --> 17:27.330
- I suppose.

17:28.294 --> 17:29.127
I suppose.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.437
- Sounds like he's trying
to buy more time to me.

17:33.437 --> 17:36.505
- You shut your sweet
little mouth muscle boy.

17:36.505 --> 17:37.922
Nobody asked you.

17:39.180 --> 17:42.040
This here is grown man business.

17:42.040 --> 17:45.357
Now go fix me something hot, tall, and hot

17:45.357 --> 17:50.357
and wiggle your sweet little
ass on the way to do it.

17:50.592 --> 17:51.509
Faggot ass.

17:52.877 --> 17:53.710
Shit.

17:56.404 --> 17:58.102
- I trust Hyman,

17:58.102 --> 17:59.315
all right?

17:59.315 --> 18:00.819
He's been a big contender.

18:00.819 --> 18:02.515
Been betting with me for a long time.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.676
He wins big, he loses big--

18:03.676 --> 18:04.926
- Chuck, Chuck.

18:06.195 --> 18:09.634
You can't pussy fool around
with these ass holes, man.

18:09.634 --> 18:11.775
- Look trust me, Slim all right?

18:11.775 --> 18:14.117
Look I know that there's others but Hyman?

18:14.117 --> 18:15.659
That bro's solid he's good people--

18:15.659 --> 18:18.380
- That motherfucker's been
running bad on the books.

18:18.380 --> 18:19.879
For three months.

18:19.879 --> 18:20.962
Three months.

18:22.227 --> 18:25.524
No square, no vig, no nothing.

18:25.524 --> 18:29.291
He always got some kind
of fucking new excuse.

18:29.291 --> 18:32.289
Now he say I got it all coming.

18:32.289 --> 18:34.872
Well shit that's what I expect.

18:37.939 --> 18:40.588
But if I don't get every penny,

18:50.232 --> 18:51.065
It's mine.

18:52.059 --> 18:52.892
- No, bro.

18:55.063 --> 18:56.650
It's Horse Dick Jimmy's.

18:56.650 --> 18:58.239

18:58.239 --> 19:00.791

19:00.791 --> 19:03.052

a alley cat with an asse--

19:03.052 --> 19:04.969
- But he'll pay, right?

19:05.928 --> 19:07.595
So what's the worry?

19:13.155 --> 19:14.238
- I hear you.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.241
I hear you.

19:19.836 --> 19:23.836

19:25.222 --> 19:27.472

19:32.063 --> 19:34.399

just finished cooking.

20:46.683 --> 20:47.568

20:47.568 --> 20:49.568

21:00.676 --> 21:02.955
- Something smells good in here.

21:02.955 --> 21:04.639
- There's a little stir fry.

21:04.639 --> 21:05.722

21:06.654 --> 21:07.962
- Sure.

21:07.962 --> 21:08.795

21:09.704 --> 21:12.968

some third parties involved,

but you know what?

21:14.101 --> 21:15.190
That sauce is on me.

21:45.991 --> 21:48.556
Man, they just don't stop.

Sunday we went to the movies.

25:51.880 --> 25:54.462
It was after one o'clock so

25:54.462 --> 25:56.675
thought you deserved a little over time.

26:19.242 --> 26:20.244

We both trade in petty evils.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.700
It gives us a common ground

26:25.700 --> 26:27.367
and yeah, I'll admit

26:28.564 --> 26:29.603
it might be a little soft

26:29.603 --> 26:32.702
to catch feelings for
a quote unquote, hoe.

26:32.702 --> 26:35.720
But after five years in the prison system,

26:35.720 --> 26:39.500
fighting with some of
the nastiest, grimiest,

26:39.500 --> 26:42.917

26:44.638 --> 26:47.160

34:04.217 --> 34:05.050
- Hypothetically.

34:05.050 --> 34:06.467

34:08.022 --> 34:09.984
We're looking at about

34:42.629 --> 34:46.432

34:46.432 --> 34:47.414
You get caught with that,

34:47.414 --> 34:49.096
we're talking manslaughter charges

34:49.096 --> 34:51.672
like life in sink-sink.

So that's it, huh?

36:06.698 --> 36:09.011

38:07.565 --> 38:09.704
He's old as fucking dirt man.

39:03.428 --> 39:05.634

39:42.247 --> 39:43.929
- Something wrong?

39:43.929 --> 39:45.346
- No, not at all.

39:46.833 --> 39:49.833
Actually, I hit it big tonight Nora.

40:00.847 --> 40:04.106
- I want to ask you

40:04.106 --> 40:04.939
- Okay.

40:08.573 --> 40:12.791
- How long have you been
with your real boyfriend?

40:12.791 --> 40:14.826
- Charlie I'm not gonna--

40:14.826 --> 40:15.725
- Look just humor me.

40:15.725 --> 40:16.558
Okay baby?

40:16.558 --> 40:18.725
Just this one time please.

40:21.839 --> 40:22.922
- Four years.

40:28.008 --> 40:31.091
- And how long have you been at work?

40:33.551 --> 40:34.384
- Three.

40:42.889 --> 40:45.047
- I'm leaving Nora.

40:45.047 --> 40:47.113
I'm leaving it all, okay?

40:47.113 --> 40:49.863
I want you to come with me, okay?

40:50.858 --> 40:52.655
You don't have to do this anymore.

40:52.655 --> 40:53.658
No more numbers

40:53.658 --> 40:55.241
and no more tricks.

40:58.951 --> 41:01.014
- Charlie do you know how many times

41:01.014 --> 41:04.134
I've heard the Cinderella
shpiel in my line of work?

41:04.134 --> 41:06.217
It's cliche, it's a song.

41:08.399 --> 41:10.875
And another thing, let's get
something straight, Charlie.

41:10.875 --> 41:13.489
I'm not some cracked out
coos giving $10 blow jobs.

41:13.489 --> 41:16.945
I make more money an
hour than most lawyers.

41:16.945 --> 41:20.112
And look around baby, Ikia everything.

41:21.068 --> 41:21.917
Freeway view.

41:21.917 --> 41:24.519
You don't have the cards to blitz me.

41:24.519 --> 41:26.436
Don't flatter yourself.

41:27.535 --> 41:28.368
- Okay.

41:31.127 --> 41:33.154
You ever make 6 million in one night?

41:33.154 --> 41:33.987
- Huh?

41:33.987 --> 41:34.820
- Huh?

41:34.820 --> 41:37.008
I didn't stutter.

41:37.008 --> 41:39.591
- Yeah right show me the money.

41:44.662 --> 41:45.777
- What's this?

41:45.777 --> 41:47.944
- That, that's crystal LSD

41:49.158 --> 41:51.241
and I got six bars worth.

41:56.255 --> 41:57.559
- Where'd you get it?

41:57.559 --> 41:58.667
- Client of mine had it,

41:58.667 --> 42:00.834
but he's dead so now I do.

42:03.873 --> 42:05.632
- You killed him?

42:05.632 --> 42:09.465
- No I found him or
pieces of him you feel me?

42:13.009 --> 42:13.842
- Then who did it?

42:13.842 --> 42:15.500
- I don't know they.

42:15.500 --> 42:16.956
- What if they find you?

42:16.956 --> 42:18.186
- They won't.

42:18.186 --> 42:19.717
They won't have time.

42:19.717 --> 42:21.196
Look come Monday okay?

42:21.196 --> 42:23.340
Charlie's Jenkins is dead.

42:23.340 --> 42:26.422
His ashes scattered, his soul
reincarnated someplace warm

42:26.422 --> 42:27.505
and tropical.

42:28.341 --> 42:30.341
I'm thinking Chiang Mai.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.840
What do you think?

42:38.965 --> 42:42.882
(speaking in foreign language)

43:01.373 --> 43:03.432
- Now I would say it's a lot

43:03.432 --> 43:05.153
but I feel sorry for you man.

43:05.153 --> 43:08.131
What you think they'll do to
you now you fucked up twice.

43:08.131 --> 43:09.854
- Man they can't kill me.

43:09.854 --> 43:11.937
All right I owe too much.

43:14.271 --> 43:17.469
- You'd be surprised what
you could live through though

43:17.469 --> 43:19.109
and you got lucky,

43:19.109 --> 43:20.770
'cause El jefe gave you a break

43:20.770 --> 43:22.520
but come Monday dawn.

43:23.816 --> 43:26.050
- But they're putting in
extra for wasting our time.

43:26.050 --> 43:27.410
- I ain't wasting no time.

43:27.410 --> 43:29.390
- We ain't got no more
fucking crystal, Dos.

43:29.390 --> 43:31.284
- Look man I know this hoe
that's selling her pussy

43:31.284 --> 43:32.210
to this here for weeks.

43:32.210 --> 43:33.630
Got so soft with one pair of leg

43:33.630 --> 43:35.597
he'd say anything when in between her.

43:35.597 --> 43:37.759
He could fucking help
to show the fucking bag.

43:37.759 --> 43:39.334
He was so proud about it.

43:39.334 --> 43:40.639
She saw it all right?

43:40.639 --> 43:43.076
I'm on this shit I'm
trying to figure it out.

43:43.076 --> 43:45.279
So I ain't wasting no time.

43:45.279 --> 43:48.039
- Better hurry the fuck up man.

43:48.039 --> 43:50.372
Pick these fucking bags man.

43:54.251 --> 43:55.567
- Shit man.

43:55.567 --> 43:57.381
You ain't double bag that shit man?

43:57.381 --> 43:59.263
- Man it's your fucking job.

43:59.263 --> 44:02.325
What the fuck you talking about?

44:02.325 --> 44:06.158
- A hoe one day, a
princess the next I love it

44:08.026 --> 44:10.410
that's why I never quit.

44:10.410 --> 44:12.697
You know my favorite
rides are roller coasters

44:12.697 --> 44:14.364
not merry go rounds.

44:15.911 --> 44:17.078
- Yeah me too.

44:21.994 --> 44:23.244
Okay let's see.

44:24.119 --> 44:26.286
(mumbles)

44:38.152 --> 44:39.693
Fuck.

44:39.693 --> 44:41.026
Fuck, fuck shit.

44:42.279 --> 44:45.281
Fuck you, Hyman why'd
I let you run so wide.

44:45.281 --> 44:47.605
- What's wrong, Charles?

44:47.605 --> 44:49.541
- Fucking forgot about Hyman's debt.

44:49.541 --> 44:51.168
- Who's he?

44:51.168 --> 44:54.910
- Hyman's a cat that left
me a fortune in his will.

44:54.910 --> 44:58.448
I was supposed to pick up
67 grand from him yesterday.

44:58.448 --> 44:59.392
- So?

44:59.392 --> 45:03.103
- So people are expecting that money.

45:03.103 --> 45:04.855
- Isn't he dead?

45:04.855 --> 45:06.762
Dead men can't pay debts.

45:06.762 --> 45:08.845
- In what universe, Nora?

45:09.806 --> 45:11.788
- Pay it down after we sell.

45:11.788 --> 45:13.485
- It doesn't work like that

45:13.485 --> 45:15.626
not with this network.

45:15.626 --> 45:18.424
I work for a major book
named Big Slim Fizz okay?

45:18.424 --> 45:21.007
And he loves to set an example.

45:21.942 --> 45:22.925
- Big Slim Fizz.

45:22.925 --> 45:23.944
Big Slim Fizz.

45:23.944 --> 45:26.745
Why does that sound so familiar?

45:26.745 --> 45:29.342
- Big slim Fizz works for a certain boss

45:29.342 --> 45:31.603
by the name of Horse Dick Jimmy

45:31.603 --> 45:35.219
and if word gets out that
Hyman had that acid, then.

45:35.219 --> 45:36.052
- Charlie,

45:36.052 --> 45:39.203
you never told me you
worked for Horse Dick Jimmy.

45:39.203 --> 45:40.036
- Come on Nora.

45:40.036 --> 45:42.749
Look all rivers lead to the ocean baby.

45:42.749 --> 45:43.925
- Oh my God.

45:43.925 --> 45:45.495
Shit.

45:45.495 --> 45:46.328
Fuck.

45:47.197 --> 45:51.362
Do you think they'd scour
the earth for 70 grand?

45:51.362 --> 45:52.541
- I don't know.

45:52.541 --> 45:53.374
I mean,

45:54.779 --> 45:56.621
I've head stories.

45:56.621 --> 45:57.621
- So have I.

45:58.861 --> 45:59.694
- Shit.

46:00.765 --> 46:01.682
Okay maybe.

46:03.481 --> 46:05.704
Maybe there's a fucking, another--

46:05.704 --> 46:06.765
- How much do you need?

46:06.765 --> 46:07.763
- So it's vig

46:07.763 --> 46:09.471
and the car--

46:09.471 --> 46:12.138
- Charlie, how much do you need?

46:13.434 --> 46:14.684
- 40, 45 grand.

46:16.445 --> 46:17.871
- Okay I can swing that.

46:17.871 --> 46:20.495
I think I can swing that, I can.

46:20.495 --> 46:21.412
- 45 grand.

46:22.335 --> 46:25.594
You got that much lying around in liquid?

46:25.594 --> 46:29.092
- Not all whores are junkies, Charlie.

46:29.092 --> 46:32.900
Me and Cole had plans for the future.

46:32.900 --> 46:33.733
- Who?

46:35.135 --> 46:36.385
- My boyfriend.

46:40.157 --> 46:41.740
- So he has a name.

46:42.941 --> 46:45.108
- That's about all he has.

46:46.543 --> 46:48.710
So when do you need it by?

46:50.222 --> 46:51.972
- Tomorrow, by seven.

46:53.550 --> 46:54.383
- Okay.

46:56.275 --> 46:59.442
Sorry baby another lifetime I suppose.

47:05.286 --> 47:07.119
- Where are you going?

47:08.312 --> 47:09.854
- I can get this money.

47:09.854 --> 47:12.854
It won't be easy for me, personally,

47:14.287 --> 47:16.490
but I'll be back with it tomorrow.

47:16.490 --> 47:20.151
- Okay Nora how sure
are you about this baby?

47:20.151 --> 47:23.568
'Cause we need every penny with this guy.

47:24.910 --> 47:27.327
- I never disappoint Charlie.

47:38.007 --> 47:40.760
(soft music)

47:40.760 --> 47:43.343
(horn blaring)

47:48.146 --> 47:50.146
(pants)

48:06.957 --> 48:08.874
(sobs)

48:11.142 --> 48:12.733
- Whoa whoa.

48:12.733 --> 48:13.816
Are you okay?

48:14.823 --> 48:17.390
(soft music)

48:17.390 --> 48:18.672
Sit down.

48:18.672 --> 48:19.755
Are you hurt?

48:20.880 --> 48:22.464
Did one of them?

48:22.464 --> 48:24.086
What happened?

48:24.086 --> 48:25.586
Please just relax.

48:26.802 --> 48:29.058
Okay just talk to me what's up?

48:29.058 --> 48:31.820
- Baby I hate to ask you this.

48:31.820 --> 48:32.653
- What?

48:34.518 --> 48:37.018
- I need to use our net stake.

48:39.085 --> 48:40.318
- What's going on?

48:40.318 --> 48:43.325
(phone beeping)

48:43.325 --> 48:44.268
(phone ringing)

48:44.268 --> 48:47.768
(electric shaver buzzing)

48:48.837 --> 48:51.430
- Jake what's up my nigga?

48:51.430 --> 48:53.263
- Tom it wasn't there.

48:55.031 --> 48:57.198
- Did you ask for it hard?

48:58.650 --> 48:59.567
- Too hard.

49:00.498 --> 49:02.884
Maybe we should come ask you.

49:02.884 --> 49:04.868
- Yo Jake chill.

49:04.868 --> 49:06.374
I just telling you what I heard, man.

49:06.374 --> 49:08.330
I didn't make any guarantees
that shit would be there--

49:08.330 --> 49:10.564
- Before you finish.

49:10.564 --> 49:13.027
- Yo Jake just chill.

49:13.027 --> 49:14.705
Let me talk to my people

49:14.705 --> 49:16.131
and I can make this right.

49:16.131 --> 49:17.667
- Yeah you go do that

49:17.667 --> 49:19.444
and I got one more thing.

49:19.444 --> 49:20.532
- Yes sir?

49:20.532 --> 49:22.690
- Do you know a Charlie Jenkins?

49:22.690 --> 49:24.009
Nigga that run books?

49:24.009 --> 49:26.633
- Charlie J yeah I know that nigga.

49:26.633 --> 49:27.629
What's up?

49:27.629 --> 49:29.790
- You know where he do his business at?

49:29.790 --> 49:32.707
I got some bets I want to lay down.

49:41.140 --> 49:43.723
(upbeat music)

49:55.111 --> 49:55.944
- I just.

49:56.896 --> 49:58.896
I don't know, fuck Nora.

50:00.443 --> 50:03.344
You're just going to give her the bonds?

50:03.344 --> 50:04.897
- I don't know Cole.

50:04.897 --> 50:06.773
Do you have cash lying around?

50:06.773 --> 50:09.381
Because if you do, I'll be
more than happy to use that.

50:09.381 --> 50:11.675
- Just chill out okay?

50:11.675 --> 50:13.555
Who is this lady again?

50:13.555 --> 50:16.183
- My friend, Sarah Holtman.

50:16.183 --> 50:18.792
We used to work those bank
fucks at (indistinct) price.

50:18.792 --> 50:22.333
You remember her tall, blonde, pretty?

50:22.333 --> 50:23.855
- No I don't

50:23.855 --> 50:26.358
but that's not the point.

50:26.358 --> 50:27.209
I just don't get it.

50:27.209 --> 50:28.520
I mean why would we pay her bills?

50:28.520 --> 50:29.868
It doesn't make any sense.

50:29.868 --> 50:31.707
- Because if the kid
doesn't get an operation,

50:31.707 --> 50:33.545
he is going to die.

50:33.545 --> 50:35.712
What don't you understand?

50:36.709 --> 50:39.709
(soft upbeat music)

50:44.161 --> 50:44.994
- What?

50:46.359 --> 50:49.260
- Just doesn't sound like you Nora.

50:49.260 --> 50:50.321
- Fuck you Cole.

50:50.321 --> 50:51.361
- Fuck me?

50:51.361 --> 50:53.777
Look you're the one trying to give away

50:53.777 --> 50:54.859
all our fucking money.

50:54.859 --> 50:56.558
- Our money?

50:56.558 --> 50:57.614
Our money?

50:57.614 --> 51:01.153
There wouldn't be a rainy
day fund if it wasn't for me.

51:01.153 --> 51:03.313
You don't contribute shit.

51:03.313 --> 51:05.153
I'm daddy in this house.

51:05.153 --> 51:07.827
- You want to go there?

51:07.827 --> 51:09.652
- Do you want to go there?

51:09.652 --> 51:12.401
Aren't you supposed to
be some big star by now?

51:12.401 --> 51:13.332
Four years in

51:13.332 --> 51:15.209
and the only role you're good for

51:15.209 --> 51:17.723
is a coke addicted pool boy.

51:17.723 --> 51:19.246
I just started sucking dick

51:19.246 --> 51:20.857
because that cholo esse was going to

51:20.857 --> 51:24.078
beat you in the face remember?

51:24.078 --> 51:26.495
(soft music)

51:31.827 --> 51:34.174
- You made that debt too baby,

51:34.174 --> 51:36.857
don't act like you weren't having fun.

51:36.857 --> 51:38.024
- I know Cole.

51:40.392 --> 51:41.892
I'm sorry, really.

51:45.980 --> 51:48.271
I just want to help my friend.

51:48.271 --> 51:52.109
We're talking about the life of a child.

51:52.109 --> 51:53.570
I know it's a lot of money to lend, but--

51:53.570 --> 51:55.570
- Take it, I don't care.

51:57.606 --> 52:01.804
Honestly all I care about
is you and me, okay?

52:01.804 --> 52:04.524
And I know you're disappointed in me.

52:04.524 --> 52:05.357
I am too.

52:06.326 --> 52:07.159
I'm sorry.

52:11.277 --> 52:13.933
We're gonna figure it out.

52:13.933 --> 52:16.516
I'm going to make it I promise.

52:17.903 --> 52:20.293
- I know you will, baby.

52:20.293 --> 52:21.126
- I guess

52:23.178 --> 52:24.242
I just want it to be you

52:24.242 --> 52:25.575
and me you know?

52:26.842 --> 52:28.592
Us against the world.

52:30.826 --> 52:33.409
- You and me against the world.

52:34.323 --> 52:35.156
Come here.

52:38.191 --> 52:40.608
(soft music)

52:44.143 --> 52:46.007
- [Charlie Voiceover] Okay

52:46.007 --> 52:47.068
Scrape every penny.

Crack every piggy bank.

52:48.866 --> 52:49.699

52:53.532 --> 52:56.348
Big Slim will not let it slide

52:58.805 --> 53:00.388

53:15.565 --> 53:17.524

53:17.524 --> 53:20.239

53:20.239 --> 53:21.117

53:21.117 --> 53:21.974

53:21.974 --> 53:23.292
- We both nothings, huh?

53:23.292 --> 53:24.709
Coincidence, huh?

53:25.574 --> 53:28.157
Funny thing those coincidences.

53:34.977 --> 53:37.397
- What kind of business.

53:37.397 --> 53:38.397

53:46.482 --> 53:49.232
Hey look it's Horse Dick Jimmy's.

54:06.284 --> 54:07.770
Don't tell me you don't

54:07.770 --> 54:09.654
- Oh nah man, another

54:17.840 --> 54:19.757
- It's nice seeing you.

54:33.156 --> 54:35.711
(hiphop music)

54:35.711 --> 54:37.695
- Horse Dick Jimmy?

54:37.695 --> 54:39.013
- Ain't my hood.

54:39.013 --> 54:40.680
I heard shit though.

54:41.626 --> 54:43.012
- You know him?

54:43.012 --> 54:45.749
- Yeah I heard of him he's somebody.

54:45.749 --> 54:48.371

54:56.735 --> 54:57.568
- Hold on.

54:59.258 --> 55:00.091
Hello.

55:00.091 --> 55:01.756

55:01.756 --> 55:03.207
There's this guy on the West side

55:03.207 --> 55:05.329
he's been pushing sip,
like big quantities.

55:05.329 --> 55:06.812
We're talking weight.

55:06.812 --> 55:08.750
- How much weight?

55:08.750 --> 55:10.996
- Bro I'm telling you

55:10.996 --> 55:13.217
and sheets like books.

55:13.217 --> 55:16.137

55:16.137 --> 55:17.304
- Where he at?

55:18.250 --> 55:20.292

55:20.292 --> 55:22.665
He's gonna be somewhere in Hollywood.

55:22.665 --> 55:23.879
- He got heart?

55:23.879 --> 55:26.367

55:36.021 --> 55:38.007

55:38.007 --> 55:40.590
(hiphop music)

55:47.356 --> 55:49.798

55:49.798 --> 55:51.215
- Did you get it?

55:52.111 --> 55:53.028

55:58.133 --> 56:01.189

56:01.189 --> 56:03.871
- Bearer bonds they're matured,

56:03.871 --> 56:05.288
better than cash.

56:06.751 --> 56:08.720
- The fuck is a bearer bond

56:08.720 --> 56:10.461
and how does it mature?

56:10.461 --> 56:11.886
- It's fucking money.

56:11.886 --> 56:12.803
It will do.

56:16.793 --> 56:18.362
- Goddamn it.

56:18.362 --> 56:19.697

56:23.595 --> 56:28.345
- Well soon you won't have to

56:31.809 --> 56:33.533

56:33.533 --> 56:36.417

56:53.704 --> 56:56.204
(door closes)

57:14.760 --> 57:17.490
- Hey Scar let me see your phone man.

58:15.806 --> 58:17.122

59:06.137 --> 59:08.764
(Slim screams then laughs)

59:08.764 --> 59:12.375
- That's what the fuck I'm talking about.

59:12.375 --> 59:14.716
15 grand in my pocket.

59:14.716 --> 59:16.775

59:16.775 --> 59:18.718

59:18.718 --> 59:21.579

59:21.579 --> 59:22.662
Slow pushups.

59:28.531 --> 59:31.365

59:31.365 --> 59:33.444
Pump that shit out.

1:00:11.890 --> 1:00:13.057

1:00:15.230 --> 1:00:17.681

1:00:20.905 --> 1:00:22.402

1:00:27.332 --> 1:00:29.776
See those are as good as cash.

1:00:29.776 --> 1:00:31.997
It's like corporate vig.

1:00:31.997 --> 1:00:34.578
- You mean bearer bonds.

1:00:34.578 --> 1:00:36.038
- What the fuck?

1:00:36.038 --> 1:00:36.871
Really?

1:00:37.862 --> 1:00:39.735
Do I need to tell you a fucking gain?

1:00:39.735 --> 1:00:41.902
Keep your mouth shut tight

and I'll let you know when,

1:00:44.219 --> 1:00:46.720
and how I want to open it.

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:49.806
You know what a bearer bond is.

1:00:49.806 --> 1:00:52.401
What's up with this Chuck?

1:00:52.401 --> 1:00:54.044
- Well he was a little short.

1:00:54.044 --> 1:00:54.877
So I pressed

1:00:54.877 --> 1:00:57.430
and let him know that
you were not joking Slim.

1:00:57.430 --> 1:01:01.313
I even leaned on him a
little bit, made him dig deep

1:01:01.313 --> 1:01:02.650
that's what I got

1:01:02.650 --> 1:01:05.233
20 grand worth of bearer bonds.

1:01:06.553 --> 1:01:09.889
- What about the $23 and 22 cents?

1:01:09.889 --> 1:01:11.309

1:01:11.309 --> 1:01:13.059
Come on Fizz, really?

1:01:15.791 --> 1:01:20.326
- Ain't no rounding numbers

1:01:20.326 --> 1:01:21.659
Now where is it?

1:01:24.431 --> 1:01:27.181
Did I tell you to stop Nancy boy?

1:01:29.158 --> 1:01:32.358
And you keep fucking dancing.

1:01:32.358 --> 1:01:34.775
(soft music)

1:01:49.419 --> 1:01:50.252
- Yeah.

1:01:51.537 --> 1:01:53.037
Good work Charlie.

1:01:54.157 --> 1:01:56.990
You're a resourceful motherfucker.

1:01:58.047 --> 1:02:01.185
Now if you don't mind I got to take this.

1:02:01.185 --> 1:02:02.183
- Of course.

1:02:02.183 --> 1:02:03.055
- All right?

1:02:03.055 --> 1:02:05.055
- You have a good night.

1:02:05.910 --> 1:02:07.327

1:02:10.157 --> 1:02:10.990
Yeah.

1:02:12.773 --> 1:02:15.309

1:02:15.309 --> 1:02:16.726
Talk dirty to me.

1:02:22.426 --> 1:02:25.890
(Charlie sighs)

1:02:25.890 --> 1:02:28.807
(car engine roars)

1:02:39.449 --> 1:02:40.446

1:02:42.078 --> 1:02:43.176

1:02:43.176 --> 1:02:45.101
What's up with the weird number?

1:02:45.101 --> 1:02:46.314
- Encrypted channel.

1:02:46.314 --> 1:02:47.837
Well more than usual.

1:02:47.837 --> 1:02:50.681
I do that when discussing multimillion

1:02:50.681 --> 1:02:53.940
dollar drug deals over the waves.

1:02:53.940 --> 1:02:55.602
- So you found a buyer?

1:02:55.602 --> 1:02:58.258
- Yes, he operates out of Seattle.

1:02:58.258 --> 1:02:59.799
Good references.

1:02:59.799 --> 1:03:03.043
Is prepared to meet you in
San Francisco to exchange.

1:03:03.043 --> 1:03:03.876

1:03:09.838 --> 1:03:11.921
- He's only offering 4.9.

1:03:18.261 --> 1:03:19.344
- Fine do it.

1:03:22.442 --> 1:03:23.406
- Got it.

1:03:41.941 --> 1:03:42.774
What the?

1:03:47.178 --> 1:03:49.845

1:03:58.336 --> 1:04:00.753
Are you running another deal?

1:04:02.054 --> 1:04:03.936
Are you breaking up the acid?

1:04:03.936 --> 1:04:06.917
Because if the dose are
short the deal's off.

1:04:06.917 --> 1:04:08.974
- Pam what are you talking about?

1:04:08.974 --> 1:04:11.574
- The word in the ether
is that some acid is going

1:04:11.574 --> 1:04:13.176

1:04:13.176 --> 1:04:14.414

1:05:36.936 --> 1:05:38.627
- I didn't touch your fucking safe.

1:05:38.627 --> 1:05:40.142
- You just been selling

1:05:40.142 --> 1:05:41.552

1:19:58.862 --> 1:19:59.695
- Goodbye.

1:20:02.796 --> 1:20:04.046
- Goodbye Cole.

1:20:05.444 --> 1:20:09.219
(door opens then closes)

1:20:09.219 --> 1:20:12.219
(music intensifies)

1:21:08.282 --> 1:21:10.419
- Damn check that hoe out right there.

1:21:10.419 --> 1:21:12.580
She's bad than a motherfucker.

1:21:12.580 --> 1:21:15.663
That looks like Jake's type you know.

1:21:17.332 --> 1:21:20.582
(knocking on the door)

1:21:26.125 --> 1:21:27.156
- Who is it?

1:21:27.156 --> 1:21:27.989
- It's me.

1:21:31.476 --> 1:21:32.309
- Hi.

1:21:32.309 --> 1:21:33.142
- Hi.

1:21:34.771 --> 1:21:35.938
Is that blood?

1:21:36.959 --> 1:21:39.046
- It's not mine don't ask.

1:21:39.046 --> 1:21:41.806
- Okay, what's with the dump?

1:21:41.806 --> 1:21:44.977
- Would you expect to find
five mil hidden in this shit?

1:21:44.977 --> 1:21:45.810
- Is it here?

1:21:45.810 --> 1:21:47.223
- Yeah it's here.

1:21:47.223 --> 1:21:48.121
- Let me see it.

1:21:48.121 --> 1:21:49.487
- It's in the can

1:21:49.487 --> 1:21:51.976
but first sugar me baby.

1:21:51.976 --> 1:21:52.809
(chuckles)

1:21:52.809 --> 1:21:54.777
- Is that what all the rush was for?

1:21:54.777 --> 1:21:56.116
- For you always.

1:21:56.116 --> 1:21:58.448
- Better not get me used to this.

1:21:58.448 --> 1:21:59.438
(both chuckle)

1:21:59.438 --> 1:22:01.497
- Wait Charlie what about the sale?

1:22:01.497 --> 1:22:03.577
Don't we have to be in Oakland?

1:22:03.577 --> 1:22:06.426
- There's time baby there's time.

1:22:06.426 --> 1:22:08.759
(both moan)

1:22:10.844 --> 1:22:12.562
- Man look at that shit.

1:22:12.562 --> 1:22:13.465
(both moaning)

1:22:13.465 --> 1:22:15.048
- 5.7 million cash.

1:22:16.803 --> 1:22:18.876
I never thought I'd see that much money

1:22:18.876 --> 1:22:20.382
after four years of whoring.

1:22:20.382 --> 1:22:22.203
- Not a whore anymore baby.

1:22:22.203 --> 1:22:23.036
(chuckles)

1:22:23.036 --> 1:22:25.865
- I wonder if it's enough
for us to make love on.

1:22:25.865 --> 1:22:28.461
- It's enough to do anything we want.

1:22:28.461 --> 1:22:29.658
- Anything I want?

1:22:29.658 --> 1:22:32.408
How much does $5.7 million weigh?

1:22:34.766 --> 1:22:36.963
What does it taste like?

1:22:36.963 --> 1:22:37.966
Feel like?

1:22:37.966 --> 1:22:38.883
Smell like?

1:22:39.784 --> 1:22:40.858
(chuckles)

1:22:40.858 --> 1:22:43.275
(soft music)

1:22:44.768 --> 1:22:46.565
- That fool strapped.

1:22:46.565 --> 1:22:47.732
- 5.7 million.

1:22:49.684 --> 1:22:51.094
- It's 4.9, baby.

1:22:51.094 --> 1:22:51.927
- 4.9?

1:22:51.927 --> 1:22:53.588
You said it was nearly six.

1:22:53.588 --> 1:22:54.489
- Service fees.

1:22:54.489 --> 1:22:55.708
Service fees baby.

1:22:55.708 --> 1:22:58.487
Look don't worry about
it we are still rich.

1:22:58.487 --> 1:23:00.005
- You lose a million dollars

1:23:00.005 --> 1:23:01.708
and you tell me not to worry about it?

1:23:01.708 --> 1:23:02.994
- Babe chill out.

1:23:02.994 --> 1:23:06.560
Look you lose a little bit when
you move fast product, okay?

1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:08.108
That's black market one-on-one.

1:23:08.108 --> 1:23:10.725
Besides we're not going to
miss it where we're going?

1:23:10.725 --> 1:23:13.367
- What kind of asshole doesn't
miss a million dollars?

1:23:13.367 --> 1:23:15.786
Bill Gates would miss a million dollars.

1:23:15.786 --> 1:23:18.290
- Babe chill out okay?

1:23:18.290 --> 1:23:22.050
4.9 in Thailand it's enough
to live off of forever.

1:23:22.050 --> 1:23:23.357
It's not like we got kids--

1:23:23.357 --> 1:23:25.287
- That's not the point Charlie.

1:23:25.287 --> 1:23:26.120
You can't--

1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:27.037
- Hey Nora.

1:23:27.970 --> 1:23:28.803
Nora.

1:23:28.803 --> 1:23:32.231
(heavily knocking on door)

1:23:32.231 --> 1:23:33.591
- Who the fuck is that?

1:23:33.591 --> 1:23:34.424
- [Cole] Come out here Nora.

1:23:34.424 --> 1:23:35.828
- I think that's my fucking boyfriend.

1:23:35.828 --> 1:23:36.999
- [Cole] You took your passport.

1:23:36.999 --> 1:23:37.832
- You brought him?

1:23:37.832 --> 1:23:38.665
- No of course not.

1:23:38.665 --> 1:23:40.242
- How did he get here then?

1:23:40.242 --> 1:23:41.244
- I don't know.

1:23:41.244 --> 1:23:44.477
Just fucking, just let me handle it.

1:23:44.477 --> 1:23:45.594
- Nora.

1:23:45.594 --> 1:23:47.525
- Hey you think that's the pimp or what?

1:23:47.525 --> 1:23:49.307
- Hey man it don't matter that's our shit.

1:23:49.307 --> 1:23:50.350
Come on let's go.

1:23:50.350 --> 1:23:52.587
Fuck these motherfuckers.

1:23:52.587 --> 1:23:54.254
- Get the fuck back.

1:23:55.978 --> 1:23:57.510
- Okay.

1:23:57.510 --> 1:23:58.516
- You gotta be kidding me.

1:23:58.516 --> 1:24:00.832
This is the fucking guy?

1:24:00.832 --> 1:24:02.544
This is Mr. Weekend?

1:24:02.544 --> 1:24:03.377
- [Nora] Cole.

1:24:03.377 --> 1:24:05.159
- This is the fucking sub bookie.

1:24:05.159 --> 1:24:06.163
- [Nora] Cole.

1:24:06.163 --> 1:24:06.996
- Get the fuck back.

1:24:06.996 --> 1:24:08.974
- All right, Okay.

1:24:08.974 --> 1:24:10.253
- Cole calm down.

1:24:10.253 --> 1:24:12.788
- You should have fucking called me baby.

1:24:12.788 --> 1:24:14.813
- Relax buddy okay?

1:24:14.813 --> 1:24:15.980
Look We're just doing a little--

1:24:15.980 --> 1:24:17.160
- A little what?

1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:17.993
A little what?

1:24:17.993 --> 1:24:20.244
A little something that
requires her passport

1:24:20.244 --> 1:24:21.145
and our money.

1:24:21.145 --> 1:24:22.152
Our fucking money.

1:24:22.152 --> 1:24:24.829
The money we fucking worked for.

1:24:24.829 --> 1:24:27.589
What would you do if the
tables were turned man?

1:24:27.589 --> 1:24:28.422
Huh?

1:24:29.782 --> 1:24:31.965
You gonna let somebody fuck you like that?

1:24:31.965 --> 1:24:33.701
Answer me motherfucker would you?

1:24:33.701 --> 1:24:34.542
- No.

1:24:34.542 --> 1:24:36.944
- No, you fucking wouldn't that's right.

1:24:36.944 --> 1:24:38.685
- [Nora] The money's coming back Cole.

1:24:38.685 --> 1:24:40.216
- [Cole] The money?

1:24:40.216 --> 1:24:41.771
What about you Nora.

1:24:41.771 --> 1:24:44.104
- [Nora] Cole, baby.

1:24:44.104 --> 1:24:47.271
- [Cole] No I'm not your fucking baby.

1:24:48.978 --> 1:24:51.478
- Let's talk about that money.

1:24:52.558 --> 1:24:53.497
- Who the fuck is this?

1:24:53.497 --> 1:24:54.612
(gunshot)

1:24:54.612 --> 1:24:57.731
(Cole screams)

1:24:57.731 --> 1:25:00.375
(groans) fuck.

1:25:00.375 --> 1:25:01.208
Fuck.

1:25:01.208 --> 1:25:03.291
(groans)

1:25:05.913 --> 1:25:07.865
- I'm that motherfucker

1:25:07.865 --> 1:25:09.206
that's gonna turn this

1:25:09.206 --> 1:25:11.516
murder, murder, suicide

1:25:11.516 --> 1:25:13.933
into a murder, murder, murder

1:25:15.998 --> 1:25:19.847
if someone don't give me back my money.

1:25:19.847 --> 1:25:22.002
I was expecting to find Jake

1:25:22.002 --> 1:25:23.662
some order out ass

1:25:23.662 --> 1:25:24.936
and four pounds of my LSD.

1:25:24.936 --> 1:25:27.880
- [Cole] I'm gonna fucking throw up.

1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:30.463
- Instead I get your bitch ass?

1:25:33.479 --> 1:25:34.812
You remember me?

1:25:35.952 --> 1:25:36.785
- No.

1:25:38.288 --> 1:25:39.888
- That's okay.

1:25:39.888 --> 1:25:42.916
'Cause I got enough
memories for the both of us.

1:25:42.916 --> 1:25:44.811
- How the fuck did y'all find me, huh?

1:25:44.811 --> 1:25:47.897
- $33 million (speaks
in foreign language).

1:25:47.897 --> 1:25:50.980
I wouldn't let my mother
hold that kind of money

1:25:50.980 --> 1:25:53.240
without putting a trace on her shit

1:25:53.240 --> 1:25:55.354
let alone that fake ass Luke Cage.

1:25:55.354 --> 1:25:57.308
- [Cole] I'm gonna fucking bleed out.

1:25:57.308 --> 1:25:58.431
- What do y'all want, huh?

1:25:58.431 --> 1:26:00.508
- I should shoot your
motherfucking dick off

1:26:00.508 --> 1:26:02.259
for that stupid ass
motherfucking question.

1:26:02.259 --> 1:26:03.752
- Okay, just hold up, okay?

1:26:03.752 --> 1:26:05.806
Just hold up man slow down.

1:26:05.806 --> 1:26:06.639
- No.

1:26:06.639 --> 1:26:08.152
(Cole groans)

1:26:08.152 --> 1:26:09.863
- Now you, shut your bitch ass up

1:26:09.863 --> 1:26:12.665
or I'ma put one in your
motherfucking face.

1:26:12.665 --> 1:26:13.582
- No, fuck.

1:26:14.508 --> 1:26:17.403
- Now where's my package at?

1:26:17.403 --> 1:26:18.840
- [Charlie Voiceover] The safes.

1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:20.536
If I lead them to one, I can get the gun

1:26:20.536 --> 1:26:22.076
and maybe I can...

1:26:22.076 --> 1:26:23.634
It's in a safe, okay?

1:26:23.634 --> 1:26:26.083
It's in the studio I
keep it in a safe, okay?

1:26:26.083 --> 1:26:27.367
It's not that far from here.

1:26:27.367 --> 1:26:28.794
Look we can go get it right now.

1:26:28.794 --> 1:26:29.683
We can go right now.

1:26:29.683 --> 1:26:30.516
- Nah.

1:26:31.783 --> 1:26:33.283
You can go get it.

1:26:35.271 --> 1:26:37.521
You can even take your time

1:26:38.459 --> 1:26:40.292
'cause while you gone,

1:26:41.554 --> 1:26:44.005
we might roll a train.

1:26:44.005 --> 1:26:44.884
- Okay.

1:26:44.884 --> 1:26:48.144
- Beat the brakes off this
little bitch of yours.

1:26:48.144 --> 1:26:48.977
- Okay.

1:26:48.977 --> 1:26:50.501
- I know where it is,

1:26:50.501 --> 1:26:52.084
where it really is.

1:26:53.619 --> 1:26:55.360
- Is that right?

1:26:55.360 --> 1:26:57.559
(punch)

1:26:57.559 --> 1:27:00.309
(Charlie groans)

1:27:01.936 --> 1:27:02.936
- It's here.

1:27:03.969 --> 1:27:05.364
I'll give it to you now.

1:27:05.364 --> 1:27:07.130
- Well go get it bitch.

1:27:07.130 --> 1:27:09.880
(Charlie groans)

1:27:12.853 --> 1:27:14.730
- [Man] Didn't I tell
you not to play with me?

1:27:14.730 --> 1:27:18.167
Didn't I tell you not to play with me?

1:27:18.167 --> 1:27:20.906
Old fake ass Don Cheadle
looking motherfucker.

1:27:20.906 --> 1:27:23.443
Where my motherfucking work at?

1:27:23.443 --> 1:27:25.683
Where my work at bro.

1:27:25.683 --> 1:27:26.680
Look at me.

1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:27.903
- Here it is come

1:27:27.903 --> 1:27:29.585
and get it.

1:27:29.585 --> 1:27:30.534
- Give me my shit bitch.

1:27:30.534 --> 1:27:32.784
(gunshots)

1:27:41.577 --> 1:27:43.755
(Cole groans)

1:27:43.755 --> 1:27:45.867
- You okay Chuck?

1:27:45.867 --> 1:27:48.450
(Cole groans)

1:27:54.593 --> 1:27:55.832
- Hey baby.

1:27:55.832 --> 1:27:58.500
- I need to go to the hospital.

1:27:58.500 --> 1:27:59.784
- Cole?

1:27:59.784 --> 1:28:00.982
You should have really stayed at home.

1:28:00.982 --> 1:28:01.815
- No no.

1:28:01.815 --> 1:28:03.982
(gunshot)

1:28:06.238 --> 1:28:09.905
(Charlie breathing heavily)

1:28:12.523 --> 1:28:14.318
- How you doing babe?

1:28:14.318 --> 1:28:15.318
- Holy Nora.

1:28:16.318 --> 1:28:18.339
Babe that was some gangster shit.

1:28:18.339 --> 1:28:19.619
- I'm free now.

1:28:19.619 --> 1:28:23.952
- Not just yet we have to
get out of here, like now.

1:28:25.771 --> 1:28:27.091
- Kiss me.

1:28:27.091 --> 1:28:28.481
- Babe there's no time for that, okay?

1:28:28.481 --> 1:28:30.524
You just bodied three niggas.

1:28:30.524 --> 1:28:32.803
- Charlie, kiss me.

1:28:32.803 --> 1:28:35.220
(soft music)

1:28:44.891 --> 1:28:47.058
(gunshot)

1:28:51.872 --> 1:28:54.622
(Charlie groans)

1:28:59.205 --> 1:29:01.741
(dramatic music)

1:29:01.741 --> 1:29:03.820
- I told you don't do it.

1:29:03.820 --> 1:29:06.219
I told you don't disappoint me.

1:29:06.219 --> 1:29:07.498
- What?

1:29:07.498 --> 1:29:08.581
- $33 million

1:29:10.342 --> 1:29:13.874
and you were gonna sell for four.

1:29:13.874 --> 1:29:14.707
Pathetic.

1:29:16.205 --> 1:29:18.122
(kiss)

1:29:22.169 --> 1:29:23.502
- Please please.

1:29:27.982 --> 1:29:30.486
(gunshot)

1:29:30.486 --> 1:29:33.236
(dramatic music)

1:29:55.763 --> 1:29:57.379
- Hey girl.

1:29:57.379 --> 1:29:58.212
- What up?

1:29:58.212 --> 1:29:59.597
- Did you get it?

1:29:59.597 --> 1:30:01.847
