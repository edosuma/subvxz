"But such a tide as moving seems
asleep,

00:19.951 --> 00:22.711
"too full for sound and foam,

00:22.711 --> 00:27.191
"when that which drew from out the
boundless deep turns again home.

00:27.191 --> 00:31.391
"Twilight and evening bell,
and after that the dark,

00:31.391 --> 00:35.591
"and may there be no sadness
or farewell when I embark."

00:35.591 --> 00:39.831
"For though from out our bourne
of time and place,

00:39.831 --> 00:42.231
"the flood may bear me far,

00:42.231 --> 00:44.951
"I hope to see my Pilot
face to face,

00:44.951 --> 00:47.071
"when I have crossed the bar."

00:49.271 --> 00:51.631
Ashes to ashes,

00:51.631 --> 00:53.831
dust to dust.

00:53.831 --> 00:57.511
We now commit
Margaret Crighton to the deep.

00:57.511 --> 01:00.111
May she rest in peace.

01:03.111 --> 01:05.191
BELL CHIMES

01:55.031 --> 01:57.271
DOG BARKS

02:24.111 --> 02:25.671
Gross.

02:47.471 --> 02:50.911
Yep. OK. No worries.
Is, is Davey there yet?

02:52.511 --> 02:55.791
OK, well, I'll be 15 minutes,
just hold tight.

02:55.791 --> 02:58.471
Well, put a jumper on, then.
Just hold tight, hang ten,

02:58.471 --> 03:00.031
whatever it is you do, Clint.

03:00.031 --> 03:01.951
They've found another one? Yeah.

03:01.951 --> 03:04.391
What, that's, like, two in as
many weeks? Three.

03:04.391 --> 03:06.871
Where's this one? Greyrock Point.

03:06.871 --> 03:09.471
Clint was out surfing and he
stumbled on it.

03:09.471 --> 03:12.431
Oooh, that's nice. Is that silk
or...? Satin.

03:12.431 --> 03:14.711
It comes in red or silver.
I'd go silver.

03:14.711 --> 03:16.671
I'm not entirely sure this is
appropriate

03:16.671 --> 03:18.031
at breakfast time, Mother.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.151
And this lot do same day delivery.
It's a big night for Mick, so.

03:21.151 --> 03:24.271
And what's so special about tonight?
Oh, you should come.

03:24.271 --> 03:27.511
He's redone the menu at the
Black Dog. Got some steaks in.

03:27.511 --> 03:29.951
He's even caught some lobsters
himself.

03:29.951 --> 03:33.911
Big night for Mick downstairs,
I thought we'd celebrate upstairs.

03:33.911 --> 03:36.111
Well, I if I'm done in time,
I'll come.

03:36.111 --> 03:39.951
Gran, look, this is the barcode
tattoo I'm getting. If I approve.

03:39.951 --> 03:42.871
You scan it on the phone,
it pings and displays my name.

03:42.871 --> 03:45.471
Does it give you a price as well?
Look, just text it to me

03:45.471 --> 03:46.791
and I'll consider it.

03:46.791 --> 03:49.711
If it's really nice,
might get the same myself.

03:49.711 --> 03:53.231
And me. Really?!

03:53.231 --> 03:54.591
BOTH: Keys!

04:00.431 --> 04:02.991
Morning, Johnny Utah. Who?

04:02.991 --> 04:05.151
Tell me you've seen Point Break.

04:05.151 --> 04:06.991
I'm not into snooker.

04:06.991 --> 04:09.791
Who's washed up this time?
They're pretty far gone.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.071
Male or female? Male, I think.

04:12.071 --> 04:14.911
The fish have had a really good go.
Did you find it?

04:14.911 --> 04:17.591
No, a lady walking her dog.
I was catching the swell.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.071
The dog walker's with
the police now.

04:20.071 --> 04:22.351
Has he been down asking questions?
Who?

04:22.351 --> 04:24.471
Journo with
the long-lens on the bluff.

04:24.471 --> 04:26.911
I didn't realise the press
were here. Oh, yeah.

04:26.911 --> 04:28.711
Top story in the Lighthaven Star.

04:28.711 --> 04:30.831
HE LAUGHS
Is that me?!

04:30.831 --> 04:33.471
Finally a cover girl.
Right, come on, let's have a look.

04:33.471 --> 04:35.911
Uhh... Are you all right?

04:35.911 --> 04:38.551
Yeah. Well, no. It's just...

04:38.551 --> 04:41.711
Quite glad I haven't eaten. Do you
want to arrange the undertaker?

04:41.711 --> 04:43.511
Thank you. Which one?

04:43.511 --> 04:45.991
Uh, try Prince's. They're reliable.

04:45.991 --> 04:48.831
And do me a favour - don't speak
to the journo on the way up.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.671
I don't want our office
passing comment.

04:50.671 --> 04:53.671
I've got a nine AM with the
Devonshire Undertakers' Association,

04:53.671 --> 04:57.551
so hopefully this'll be the last.
But the papers will be all over it.

04:57.551 --> 05:00.231
You think this is another
botched sea-burial?

05:00.231 --> 05:01.831
Lightning doesn't strike thrice.

05:01.831 --> 05:03.871
Morning. Morning. Morning.
Morning, Jim.

05:14.431 --> 05:17.791
I'd like to report a missing person.
OK. OK.

05:45.311 --> 05:48.431
On to item two, uh, which is this...

05:48.431 --> 05:50.751
SHE SLAMS DOOR
Thanks for waiting.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.111
Punctuality is
the politeness of kings.

05:53.111 --> 05:56.631
For those who don't know her,
this is our coroner, Jane Kennedy.

05:56.631 --> 06:00.351
I know everyone here, Bill.
So, this is the problem.

06:00.351 --> 06:01.991
Three in a month.

06:01.991 --> 06:04.871
We need to talk about reforming
the rules on sea-burials.

06:04.871 --> 06:06.711
I hope that you're not suggesting

06:06.711 --> 06:09.791
those present are lacking in
their jobs? It's possible.

06:09.791 --> 06:12.311
I'm sorry, but everyone here takes
a great deal

06:12.311 --> 06:13.911
of professional pride in their work.

06:13.911 --> 06:17.151
Well, these botched sea-burials
could easily be undertakers

06:17.151 --> 06:19.671
outside of your jurisdiction.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.631
Or strong currents.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.671
Why aren't being hauled to
an emergency general meeting?

06:25.671 --> 06:28.071
It is a subject I've raised
with the Coroner's Society

06:28.071 --> 06:31.311
and it's not just here, but we can't
ignore the fact it is happening here

06:31.311 --> 06:34.471
and something needs
to be done about it.

06:34.471 --> 06:38.551
Look, it's not my job to say how
people are disposed of.

06:38.551 --> 06:41.911
If they want a traditional
sea-burial, I'm all for it.

06:41.911 --> 06:45.031
But what I won't support is a
situation where unidentified bodies

06:45.031 --> 06:47.631
keep turning up on my patch because
of botched sea-burials.

06:47.631 --> 06:50.271
I can't have it. What do you propose?

06:51.511 --> 06:54.511
The simplest thing would be to
insist that all bodies

06:54.511 --> 06:57.591
buried at sea are subjected
to a DNA test.

06:57.591 --> 07:00.351
A voluntary test! For now.

07:00.351 --> 07:02.351
Well, who's going to pay for that?

07:02.351 --> 07:04.511
You would pass that onto the
customer.

07:04.511 --> 07:08.231
Undertaking is a highly
competitive...undertaking.

07:08.231 --> 07:09.351
If we raise our rates,

07:09.351 --> 07:11.831
our customers may well take their
business elsewhere.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.271
You could all raise your rates.

07:13.271 --> 07:15.431
That would be price-fixing,
which is illegal.

07:15.431 --> 07:18.751
And, in case you hadn't noticed,
we've just come out of a recession.

07:18.751 --> 07:20.031
I did catch the news, yes.

07:20.031 --> 07:21.791
Or...why don't pay for it?

07:21.791 --> 07:24.711
My office barely has enough money
to keep the lights on, Bill.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.471
You of all people should know that.

07:26.471 --> 07:28.471
Voluntary DNA testing
isn't going to work.

07:28.471 --> 07:30.311
You could lobby to make
DNA testing law.

07:30.311 --> 07:32.671
That would require
a change in national legislation.

07:32.671 --> 07:35.391
And, as a councillor, you would be
in a perfect position to throw

07:35.391 --> 07:36.911
some of your weight that way.

07:36.911 --> 07:39.431
I don't see why those
who are recently bereaved have to

07:39.431 --> 07:42.831
submit their lost loved one
to an invasion of their privacy.

07:42.831 --> 07:44.391
It's a tiny sample.

07:44.391 --> 07:47.311
It's the principle. It's
an invasion of their human rights.

07:47.311 --> 07:49.711
I'm not entirely sure dead bodies
have human rights.

07:49.711 --> 07:51.511
I think you'll find
if you ask a lawyer...

07:51.511 --> 07:54.551
I don't need to ask a lawyer, Bill,
I am one. And when I was appearing

07:54.551 --> 07:56.951
at the Supreme Court,
they most certainly didn't.

07:56.951 --> 07:58.871
Well you're not in London now.

08:03.551 --> 08:06.631
You won't consider passing
this on to your customers?

08:09.311 --> 08:12.511
Then perhaps it's time I conducted
a review of which undertakers

08:12.511 --> 08:13.911
I use in the future.

08:23.071 --> 08:24.391
So, who's missing?

08:24.391 --> 08:28.071
My boyfriend. And when was
the last time you saw him?

08:28.071 --> 08:31.911
Like...like, about a week.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.951
Be good to be precise about that.

08:33.951 --> 08:37.191
Uh, Sunday.
It was a week ago on Sunday.

08:37.191 --> 08:39.631
Ten days. That's a long time.

08:39.631 --> 08:42.270
Well, he does that.
He leaves home and takes off sailing

08:42.270 --> 08:45.351
when he wants to clear his head,
like, you know. Sailing?

08:45.351 --> 08:48.351
Yeah, he went sailing - boat's gone.
What kind of boat is it?

08:49.351 --> 08:51.711
A National 12. A blue wooden hull.

08:51.711 --> 08:54.511
It's called Hispaniola.

08:54.511 --> 08:56.471
Does he sail it on his own?

08:56.471 --> 08:58.231
Yeah, I can't stand the water.

09:00.031 --> 09:03.311
And how often does he go out?
Once, twice a month.

09:03.311 --> 09:06.951
So, he's fairly experienced,
you'd say? Thanks. Very.

09:08.351 --> 09:11.391
Has he gone off unexpectedly
before, is that right?

09:11.391 --> 09:14.351
Yeah, but never for this long.
Always calls.

09:14.351 --> 09:16.831
How's his health? Why?

09:16.831 --> 09:19.511
Well, does he suffer from epilepsy,
anything like that?

09:19.511 --> 09:23.431
No, he's fine.
Do you think he's drowned?

09:23.431 --> 09:26.431
Well, if he's come off his boat,
we'd expect to find the wreckage.

09:26.431 --> 09:28.271
They can't sail themselves.

09:28.271 --> 09:30.911
And I haven't had any reports
like that from the Coastguard,

09:30.911 --> 09:34.271
but I'll double check.
Has been pretty stormy of late.

09:35.711 --> 09:39.191
When you say "clear his head",
what do you mean by that?

09:39.191 --> 09:42.311
Oh, he, he gets himself
into scrapes.

09:42.311 --> 09:45.871
Trouble? Yeah, gets himself into
trouble, like. With you lot.

09:49.831 --> 09:51.911
What's his name?

09:51.911 --> 09:53.591
Burton.

09:53.591 --> 09:55.031
Kevin Burton.

09:56.551 --> 09:58.591
Your fella is Kevin Burton?

09:58.591 --> 09:59.831
You know him?

10:01.831 --> 10:02.871
I do.

10:05.711 --> 10:07.311
Mate, I said "no comment."

10:07.311 --> 10:09.671
Jane, here's your list of those
gone in the night,

10:09.671 --> 10:11.071
and you've missed your ten AM

10:11.071 --> 10:13.031
with the Bereavement Officer.
I'll call her.

10:13.031 --> 10:16.071
These are from the community, all
natural causes apart from that one,

10:16.071 --> 10:17.951
which is an RTC,
but they weren't a donor.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.831
Here's your post, and don't forget
you've got court at half four.

10:20.831 --> 10:23.551
I've had lots of calls from the
press but I've said "no comment."

10:23.551 --> 10:25.551
Good. That journalist has been
hanging about.

10:25.551 --> 10:27.711
I told him you weren't going
to be passing comment,

10:27.711 --> 10:32.151
but he's pretty persistent.
And, uh, Davey's here. Thank you.

10:32.151 --> 10:34.751
Hey, Clint? Nice pic online.

10:34.751 --> 10:38.751
Cheers. Getting one framed for Mum.
She's really proud.

10:40.351 --> 10:42.751
Thought you said he wasn't
efficient. He isn't.

10:42.751 --> 10:44.911
Apparently the storms brought a
big swell

10:44.911 --> 10:46.671
and he wants to clock off by lunch.

10:46.671 --> 10:50.151
Which isn't going to happen. If this
is a social call, can it wait?

10:50.151 --> 10:52.391
Tell me about that body
that's washed up.

10:52.391 --> 10:53.751
How long was it in the water?

10:53.751 --> 10:56.831
Uh, I don't have the PM yet,
but bodies rot pretty quickly

10:56.831 --> 10:59.031
when they've been exposed.

10:59.031 --> 11:02.591
This one's particularly grim.
Looks like the marshmallow man.

11:02.591 --> 11:05.391
Have you got any ID? It's further
gone than the other ones.

11:05.391 --> 11:08.111
Getting an ID from it's going
to take a miracle. All right.

11:08.111 --> 11:10.471
Could it be this guy?
Honestly, the fish had a right go.

11:10.471 --> 11:12.311
All his clothes were torn off by
bloating.

11:12.311 --> 11:13.871
The only thing on him was his watch.

11:13.871 --> 11:16.391
Well, this is Kevin Burton.
He's a troublemaker.

11:16.391 --> 11:18.711
Rubs people up the wrong way,
gets into fights.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.671
I've picked him up a few times
but he's never been charged.

11:21.671 --> 11:22.831
He's missing.

11:22.831 --> 11:25.071
He went sailing ten days ago
and he hasn't come back.

11:25.071 --> 11:27.351
My bloat'n'float's a botched
sea-burial.

11:27.351 --> 11:29.591
Well, if it's this guy,
it's my bloat'n'float.

11:29.591 --> 11:33.071
Body's mine, not yours.
It was stormy when he went out.

11:33.071 --> 11:35.871
If you've arrested him, don't you
have his DNA in your system?

11:35.871 --> 11:38.671
Yeah, we should, but...
I can't find it.

11:38.671 --> 11:40.791
I'm going to chase up
the National Database,

11:40.791 --> 11:43.751
but I'm pretty sure this is my man.
My man.

11:43.751 --> 11:45.991
Maybe your man had a blow out
with his girlfriend

11:45.991 --> 11:49.151
and has just gone off for some space.
Or maybe he's lying in the mortuary.

11:49.151 --> 11:51.271
Or maybe you should check
out his place of work.

11:51.271 --> 11:52.711
Well, I'm going now.

11:54.511 --> 11:56.271
You all right? Fine.

11:56.271 --> 11:59.031
Just don't want to talk to that
flipping journalist out there.

11:59.031 --> 12:01.151
Well, don't. I can't exactly
avoid him, Davey,

12:01.151 --> 12:02.671
he's camped outside my office.

12:02.671 --> 12:04.511
Well, get out of your office.

12:04.511 --> 12:06.791
I'm going to the Hippodrome Casino.

12:06.791 --> 12:08.711
I don't like to gamble before lunch.

12:08.711 --> 12:10.711
Well, Burton worked security there.

12:10.711 --> 12:13.631
Come on. Prove me wrong.

12:15.951 --> 12:18.311
All right. Maybe a quick flutter.

12:37.871 --> 12:40.431
Excuse me, love.
I'm looking for a Harvey Campbell.

12:40.431 --> 12:42.871
Do you know where I can find
him? Out back.

12:42.871 --> 12:45.151
That way, yeah? That way. Thanks.

12:48.711 --> 12:50.111
Seven.

12:51.791 --> 12:53.471
Harvey Campbell?

12:53.471 --> 12:55.551
I'm DS Higgins.

12:55.551 --> 12:57.831
This is my colleague, Jane Kennedy.

12:57.831 --> 13:01.431
We're looking for a Kevin Burton.
Eight.

13:01.431 --> 13:04.031
We understand he works here.

13:04.031 --> 13:05.271
Nine.

13:08.071 --> 13:09.711
Ten! Burton.

13:14.671 --> 13:17.111
What about him? Have you seen him?

13:21.111 --> 13:24.711
You think he'd come back here?
Please.

13:24.711 --> 13:26.431
When was the last time you did?

13:27.711 --> 13:30.391
He worked his shift that Saturday,

13:30.391 --> 13:32.271
then that's it.

13:32.271 --> 13:34.591
Gone. Vanished.

13:35.831 --> 13:37.631
Has he ever missed work before?

13:39.111 --> 13:43.831
Too precise for that.
Burton have a sportsman mentality.

13:43.831 --> 13:46.991
In the last three years,
he never missed a day.

13:46.991 --> 13:50.271
So, you'd say you know him well?
Should do.

13:50.271 --> 13:52.711
I promoted him for long enough.

13:52.711 --> 13:54.551
He's a good fighter.

13:54.551 --> 13:56.911
Hands like shovels.

13:56.911 --> 14:00.071
Burton's a boxer? Was.

14:00.071 --> 14:02.311
Could lift more than me.

14:02.311 --> 14:03.431
And I'm pretty big.

14:08.071 --> 14:12.871
Look...it's not a crime till someone
reports it, right?

14:12.871 --> 14:14.031
And I haven't.

14:16.191 --> 14:18.191
So who grassed me up?

14:18.191 --> 14:20.871
What makes you think it's a crime,
Mr Campbell?

14:22.591 --> 14:24.511
The money.

14:24.511 --> 14:27.071
We're just investigating
a missing person.

14:34.391 --> 14:35.751
All right, look.

14:41.351 --> 14:43.751
Every weekend, a security van comes

14:43.751 --> 14:46.431
and collects the casino's
earnings...

14:46.431 --> 14:49.031
and, a week ago Saturday,

14:49.031 --> 14:51.311
75 grand went missing

14:51.311 --> 14:53.351
between the front door and that van.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.151
And Burton was on security?

14:55.151 --> 14:57.591
Looks and brains.

14:57.591 --> 14:59.391
So why didn't you report that?

15:01.271 --> 15:03.351
I probably should have done.

15:03.351 --> 15:05.111
Yeah.

15:05.111 --> 15:08.671
Do you want to make a statement?
No, thank you.

15:08.671 --> 15:10.311
I'll take care of it.

15:10.311 --> 15:13.951
Well, how about you leave the law
and order side of things to me?

15:13.951 --> 15:17.751
And how about you just leave
and go back to your station?

15:17.751 --> 15:19.831
You can stay, if you like.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.111
Good morning, Mr Campbell.

15:36.151 --> 15:38.231
Yo.

15:38.231 --> 15:41.311
Look, the police catch
a sniff of Burton.

15:41.311 --> 15:44.871
Yeah? So come down here - fast.

15:46.071 --> 15:49.271
Right, so, an exemplary employee
goes missing from work

15:49.271 --> 15:51.831
the same day as he goes missing
from home,

15:51.831 --> 15:53.351
after going sailing,

15:53.351 --> 15:56.231
and, ten days later,
a body washes up,

15:56.231 --> 15:58.391
and he's the suspect in a robbery.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.871
A robbery that's not been
officially reported.

16:01.871 --> 16:04.551
All right, he's the suspect
in a suspected robbery, then.

16:05.591 --> 16:09.231
My gut still says it's a botched
sea-burial - not Burton.

16:09.231 --> 16:10.351
Well, mine doesn't.

16:12.191 --> 16:13.391
Cheers, mate.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.591
Thanks.

16:19.471 --> 16:22.271
PM's ready. Great, thanks.
Oh, is that journalist still here?

16:22.271 --> 16:24.471
Oh, he's not leaving till he gets
your comment.

16:24.471 --> 16:26.471
Not going to happen.
Right, let's see the body.

16:26.471 --> 16:28.591
If that's everything, I'm going
to nip out. Uh...

16:28.591 --> 16:31.351
Maybe you're just clinging on to
your view cos you're cheesed off

16:31.351 --> 16:32.951
with the Undertakers' Association.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.751
Maybe three in a month's a pattern
I can't ignore. All right, well,

16:35.751 --> 16:37.391
you follow your gut,
I'll follow mine,

16:37.391 --> 16:39.951
but I'm telling you - I'm right.
And what's at stake?

16:39.951 --> 16:41.311
How about a steak?

16:41.311 --> 16:43.631
Off Mick's new menu? All right,
you're on.

16:43.631 --> 16:46.151
Clint, I want you to doorstop
all the undertakers

16:46.151 --> 16:48.351
registered on our books
to perform sea-burials.

16:48.351 --> 16:51.631
Get descriptions and historys of all
sea-burials in the last two months.

16:51.631 --> 16:53.951
Well, can't I just call them?
No. They'll evade.

16:53.951 --> 16:56.911
There can only be half a dozen in
the whole county. But that's miles.

16:56.911 --> 17:00.951
You can go surfing tomorrow.
The swell will be over tomorrow.

17:00.951 --> 17:02.831
Well, you're on my time,
Clint, not yours.

17:02.831 --> 17:05.111
Keep me posted on what you find.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.671
Oh, and, Clint?

17:06.671 --> 17:08.431
Beware Greeks bearing gifts.

17:14.871 --> 17:15.911
Thanks.

17:17.511 --> 17:18.550
Right.

17:19.711 --> 17:23.151
Decomposition consistent
with immersion at sea.

17:23.151 --> 17:25.070
Extensive PM predation
by sea creatures

17:25.070 --> 17:27.550
rendering ID impossible
at this stage.

17:27.550 --> 17:28.911
Excellent.

17:28.911 --> 17:33.671
How old? Uh, says, by the pink
teeth, 30s or 40s.

17:33.671 --> 17:35.511
Tick.

17:35.511 --> 17:37.231
Time of death?

17:37.231 --> 17:39.311
Anything up to a fortnight ago.

17:39.311 --> 17:40.911
Tick again.

17:42.551 --> 17:44.311
Hello.

17:44.311 --> 17:46.551
What's it say on the teeth?

17:47.711 --> 17:50.351
Missing cuspid on upper right.

17:50.351 --> 17:53.071
Right, and who misses their teeth?

17:53.071 --> 17:56.271
Uh, sugar addicts. Sugar Ray
Leonards, more like - boxers.

17:56.271 --> 17:59.231
Tick, tick, tick.
And he's a big lad, too.

17:59.231 --> 18:01.071
Well, once a body's been
exposed like this,

18:01.071 --> 18:02.631
you can't tell how muscly they were.

18:02.631 --> 18:06.711
Especially when they're this
inflated by death gasses.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.031
Hold on. What?
"Cause of death..."

18:10.551 --> 18:13.671
Drowning. "Cause of death -
blunt trauma to basal skull

18:13.671 --> 18:15.431
"and upper cervical vertebrae.

18:15.431 --> 18:18.791
"Traumatic basal subarachnoid
haemorrhage, as a consequence."

18:18.791 --> 18:21.191
OK, so Burton steals money,

18:21.191 --> 18:23.071
gets chased down by the heavies,

18:23.071 --> 18:25.591
they whack him on the back
of the head with a baseball bat

18:25.591 --> 18:27.791
and chuck him into the sea.
Still don't have DNA.

18:27.791 --> 18:30.231
Oh, come on.
You're clutching at straws.

18:30.231 --> 18:32.071
Right, anything else?

18:32.071 --> 18:34.431
Just his personal effects -
the watch that was on him.

18:34.431 --> 18:36.591
Pretty fancy for a security guard.

18:36.591 --> 18:38.151
Well, not if it's a fake.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.671
Look. They've spelt Rolex wrong.

18:42.391 --> 18:44.271
What's that sound? Hmm?

18:44.271 --> 18:46.391
Sounds like...sizzling.

18:46.391 --> 18:49.791
And that smell, it's like...

18:49.791 --> 18:51.391
..steak.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.911
Mmm, steak!

18:55.351 --> 18:58.071
Do you reckon Mick could knock up
a bearnaise sauce?

18:58.071 --> 19:00.111
Those peppercorns, they give me
heartburn.

19:00.111 --> 19:02.671
It's not necessarily murder.
Could be a bad gybe.

19:02.671 --> 19:05.231
You turn a boat the wrong way,
the boom rips right across,

19:05.231 --> 19:07.831
could easily clatter you at
head-height. But our bet's not on

19:07.831 --> 19:10.511
whether it's a murder or not,
it's whether that's Kevin Burton

19:10.511 --> 19:12.471
in there, benchpressing his own
coffin lid.

19:12.471 --> 19:15.231
I'm not buying you a steak till we
get confirmation on the DNA.

19:16.631 --> 19:19.311
Right, OK, Better go
and see his missus, then.

19:36.071 --> 19:37.311
Can I help?

19:38.391 --> 19:40.831
Uh, do you do sea-burials?

19:40.831 --> 19:43.471
Indeed. I don't suppose
I could have a list

19:43.471 --> 19:46.031
of all the ones you've done in the
last month, could I?

19:46.031 --> 19:48.511
Which rag are you from?
Which newspaper? I'm not.

19:48.511 --> 19:50.711
Well, it's not us, OK?
There's no need to blame...

19:50.711 --> 19:54.991
I'm from the coroner's office.
Oh, why didn't you say so, sweetie?!

19:54.991 --> 19:57.111
You don't look
much like a coroner to me.

19:57.111 --> 19:58.871
So, how are they supposed to look?!

19:58.871 --> 20:02.911
Somehow, more...wizened and sinewed.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.911
So, uh, can I have
the records, please?

20:04.911 --> 20:08.871
Would you like a drink? Cup of tea
or a fruity juice? No, thanks.

20:08.871 --> 20:11.391
A slice of cake? Freshly baked.

20:11.391 --> 20:13.631
Gateau - Death by Chocolate.

20:13.631 --> 20:16.671
Just the records for whatever
sea-burials you've done

20:16.671 --> 20:19.071
in the last month.
All right, hold the fort.

20:19.071 --> 20:24.071
You must forgive my tone - we've had
hell from the press all day.

20:24.071 --> 20:28.031
Ah. Here they are. There are two.

20:28.031 --> 20:30.431
The last one we did was this morning.

20:30.431 --> 20:33.351
Margaret Crighton - lovely lady,
but dead.

20:33.351 --> 20:36.351
Thanks. You will take care of them,
won't you, sweetie?

20:36.351 --> 20:38.151
And you give my very warmest to Jane?

20:38.151 --> 20:40.431
In fact, why don't you give her
the cake? No, thanks.

20:40.431 --> 20:43.191
Really, I insist. No, seriously.
I insist.

20:43.191 --> 20:45.191
OK. Thanks for the files.

20:45.191 --> 20:47.871
Any time. Come again. Ooh!

20:49.631 --> 20:51.231
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

20:52.991 --> 20:54.391
All right.

20:55.631 --> 20:58.111
LOUD DANCE MUSIC

21:06.791 --> 21:09.951
Can we come in? You've found a body,
I've seen it on the news.

21:09.951 --> 21:11.911
We've found a body,
but we don't know who it is.

21:11.911 --> 21:14.431
It's him. We don't know that yet.
I'm going half crazy here -

21:14.431 --> 21:17.271
phone's ringing off the hook. Well,
if you like, I can arrange for

21:17.271 --> 21:19.831
a family liaison officer
to be with you? Uh, no.

21:19.831 --> 21:22.751
No, no, I'd, uh,
I'd rather be on my own.

21:22.751 --> 21:26.271
If it's all right with you,
we'd like to do a DNA check.

21:26.271 --> 21:29.471
What will you need? Best thing would
be for us to contact his mum.

21:29.471 --> 21:31.271
She died - 2005.

21:31.271 --> 21:32.951
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:32.951 --> 21:35.671
So who would be his next of kin?

21:35.671 --> 21:37.551
Well, I...I guess that's me.

21:37.551 --> 21:42.071
You don't share DNA with him, so
perhaps we can take something of his?

21:42.071 --> 21:45.511
Uh, toothbrushes are best.
Ah, he took it with him sailing.

21:45.511 --> 21:48.551
Well, does he have a cup or
a glass that he uses, you know,

21:48.551 --> 21:51.551
maybe by the side of the...
He hasn't. Could you check?

21:51.551 --> 21:53.431
I washed it up. I'm a clean freak.

21:56.791 --> 21:59.551
Well, if there is anything that
you can think of that might help us

21:59.551 --> 22:02.391
identify him, perhaps you could
bring it in. I'll do my best.

22:02.391 --> 22:04.591
Was he missing any teeth?

22:04.591 --> 22:07.311
No. No, I don't think so.

22:07.311 --> 22:09.351
You're sure? Yeah.

22:09.351 --> 22:12.551
Did he wear a watch?
Yes, he did. It was a Rolex.

22:12.551 --> 22:15.671
I got it for him. It was a fake.
Not that he knew.

22:15.671 --> 22:18.191
Fake Rolex. Shall we?

22:18.191 --> 22:20.911
One last thing.
What colour were his eyes?

22:25.151 --> 22:26.551
I don't know.

22:26.551 --> 22:28.991
OK. Thanks, Dora. We'll be in touch.

22:41.031 --> 22:44.471
Maybe there was a struggle on the
boat and his tooth was knocked out.

22:44.471 --> 22:47.431
Or his tooth was knocked out
during a bad...gybe,

22:47.431 --> 22:49.351
or whatever it is you call it.

22:49.351 --> 22:52.191
What about the colour of his eyes?
What about them?

22:52.191 --> 22:54.151
Well, she would know.

22:54.151 --> 22:56.671
Maybe she's colour-blind.

22:56.671 --> 22:59.231
Women can't be colour-blind, Davey.

22:59.231 --> 23:01.231
That's a porkie, ain't it?

23:01.231 --> 23:02.471
OK.

23:02.471 --> 23:05.631
But everyone knows the colour of
their partner's eyes.

23:08.351 --> 23:11.431
Davey, tell me you know
the colour of Annette's eyes. Course!

23:11.431 --> 23:13.711
What colour are they? I don't know.

23:15.271 --> 23:18.511
Never admit that. Ever.
I know what colour your eyes are.

23:20.311 --> 23:22.111
Never admit that either.

23:24.991 --> 23:27.031
PHONE RINGS

23:28.711 --> 23:30.951
Inspector Observant's phone.
Give me that.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.631
He's driving. It's Jane.

23:34.191 --> 23:36.071
Yes, that one.

23:37.991 --> 23:39.671
OK.

23:39.671 --> 23:41.591
Yep. OK, got that. Thanks.

23:43.191 --> 23:44.591
They've found a boat.

23:54.511 --> 23:56.591
You seen we've got a shadow?

23:56.591 --> 24:00.391
Yeah. That'll be one of Campbell's.

24:00.391 --> 24:01.911
Right, there's your boat.

24:07.191 --> 24:08.751
Shall we?

24:17.311 --> 24:18.431
How did it get here?

24:20.351 --> 24:22.151
It fell out the sky?

24:22.151 --> 24:25.151
I mean, the body's 12 miles away -
how can the boat be here

24:25.151 --> 24:26.671
and the body be over there?

24:27.871 --> 24:30.031
Maybe it sailed on without him?

24:30.031 --> 24:31.151
Sir? Yeah?

24:32.191 --> 24:33.311
All right, thanks.

24:39.351 --> 24:41.391
"Hispaniola."

24:41.391 --> 24:44.311
I'll get Mick to heat up a pan,
shall I? Yeah.

24:45.911 --> 24:47.871
Thanks, mate. Thank you.

24:50.791 --> 24:53.871
Oh, come on, Calamity,
don't look so glum. I'm not.

24:53.871 --> 24:55.711
You've still got a body,
and it's a murder -

24:55.711 --> 24:58.311
that's far more exciting
than someone falling overboard.

24:58.311 --> 24:59.511
If you'd stolen 75 grand,

24:59.511 --> 25:01.791
would you really jump into a boat
and sail away?

25:01.791 --> 25:05.431
And in a storm? You just wouldn't.
Well, I don't know.

25:05.431 --> 25:07.431
Maybe he wanted to keep a low
profile.

25:07.431 --> 25:09.631
There's not a lot of CCTV
at sea, is there?

25:09.631 --> 25:11.151
Just sticks in my throat.

25:11.151 --> 25:14.071
Not as much as that steak's going
to. You just don't like losing,

25:14.071 --> 25:16.951
that's all. Can you take a left up
here? I'm going to work from home.

25:16.951 --> 25:19.511
All right, you don't have to buy me
a steak, it's all right.

25:19.511 --> 25:21.311
We made a deal, it's fine.
I'll stick to it.

25:21.311 --> 25:23.831
You can do me a favour, though,
and put me out of my misery

25:23.831 --> 25:26.111
by getting that DNA match.
Must be in by now.

25:43.951 --> 25:45.431
Can I help you, son?

25:45.431 --> 25:47.871
I'm from the Coroner's Office
in Lighthaven.

25:47.871 --> 25:50.431
I understand you do sea-burials.
I do, yes.

25:50.431 --> 25:52.351
Have you had any in the last month?

25:53.911 --> 25:55.311
Oh. Would you, um...

25:57.031 --> 25:58.591
Just one minute.

26:04.311 --> 26:06.471
Hello?

26:06.471 --> 26:07.511
Eh?

26:11.151 --> 26:12.191
Canine.

26:14.551 --> 26:16.471
It's gone.

26:16.471 --> 26:17.551
Yes, I'm certain.

26:19.671 --> 26:20.711
Okey dokey.

26:24.271 --> 26:26.831
Right. Where were we?

26:26.831 --> 26:27.871
Dog person?

26:29.751 --> 26:31.311
You know.

26:31.311 --> 26:34.831
Oh, yes. Dog's gone missing.

26:34.831 --> 26:36.311
Sorry about that.

26:36.311 --> 26:38.551
We do do sea-burials, yes.

26:38.551 --> 26:40.271
Oh, good. Can I see the files?

26:40.271 --> 26:44.111
You can. In fact, we've had a
couple over the past month.

26:44.111 --> 26:47.551
Couple of ladies. I'll just...
Ladies?

26:47.551 --> 26:50.431
Yes. Why? Ah, doesn't matter.

26:50.431 --> 26:53.351
No, it's no trouble.
No, it's cool. Thanks, though.

26:53.351 --> 26:55.551
Hey, I hope your dog comes back.

26:55.551 --> 26:56.871
I love dogs.

27:08.311 --> 27:09.951
So!

27:09.951 --> 27:13.071
You're an Plymouth Argyle
supporter, eh?

27:14.471 --> 27:15.671
Yeah.

27:15.671 --> 27:17.951
I'm a Pilgrim, too, for my sins.

27:17.951 --> 27:19.711
You a season ticket holder?

27:19.711 --> 27:22.511
No, I just sort of go when I can.

27:22.511 --> 27:24.511
Well, if you're looking for
freebies,

27:24.511 --> 27:26.031
I've got a pal who's got a box.

27:26.031 --> 27:28.671
I'm sure he'd let you have it for
free if he's not using it.

27:28.671 --> 27:30.671
You serious? Of course!

27:30.671 --> 27:33.351
Here. Let me give you my number.

27:53.751 --> 27:56.351
Be sure and give my best to Jane.

27:56.351 --> 27:59.471
Make sure she sends some
business in my direction.

28:11.151 --> 28:14.231
So, I know when you died...

28:14.231 --> 28:17.151
and I know how you died...

28:17.151 --> 28:20.071
but if you could tell where you died,
or, better still, who you are,

28:20.071 --> 28:21.471
that would be a big help.

28:26.591 --> 28:29.591
OK, let's say it is you.
You stole some money

28:29.591 --> 28:32.591
and thought you'd sail away,

28:32.591 --> 28:35.831
but someone caught up with you
and tossed you overboard.

28:37.271 --> 28:41.031
I mean, really? Look at the size
of you.

28:41.031 --> 28:43.751
And you'd risk everything
for 75 grand?

28:45.751 --> 28:48.711
And there's your girlfriend,
who doesn't seem to know

28:48.711 --> 28:50.151
if you're missing any teeth,

28:50.151 --> 28:53.911
can't remember the colour of your
eyes and buys you fake gifts?

28:53.911 --> 28:55.151
Doesn't fit, does it?

28:57.431 --> 28:59.231
None of it...fits.

Hello, National DNA Database.

29:11.831 --> 29:13.311
Hello!

29:13.311 --> 29:16.231
Hello, there. It's DS Higgins
from Lighthaven Police.

29:16.231 --> 29:18.871
I'm having trouble with a file.

29:18.871 --> 29:20.831
Yeah, a Kevin Burton.

29:20.831 --> 29:23.271
I'm pretty sure we've done a DNA
test on him in the past,

29:23.271 --> 29:24.511
but it's not showing.

29:26.111 --> 29:28.471
Yeah, uh, he was arrested,

29:28.471 --> 29:31.111
but not charged back in June 2012.

29:31.111 --> 29:33.431
Now, I don't know if that's a glitch
or...

29:35.431 --> 29:36.671
Deleted?

29:40.231 --> 29:41.711
And you caught it yourself?

29:41.711 --> 29:45.791
People don't catch lobsters.
They catch themselves in the traps.

29:45.791 --> 29:47.951
How're you going to kill it?

29:47.951 --> 29:49.311
I'm not sure yet.

29:52.471 --> 29:54.271
Mum, close your eyes a sec.

29:54.271 --> 29:57.111
Have you got a present for me?
I love surprises.

29:57.111 --> 29:59.111
Mick, what colour are Mum's eyes?

30:00.671 --> 30:04.391
Ah, I don't spend a lot of time
looking at her eyes.

30:04.391 --> 30:07.551
But blue. Blue as a summer sky.

30:08.911 --> 30:10.751
I got such a treat for you later.

30:12.631 --> 30:16.191
If you don't know the colour
of your lover's eyes you've got no

30:16.191 --> 30:19.071
business knowing her otherwise.

BELL RINGS

30:51.311 --> 30:53.631
Can I speak to the undertaker,
please?

30:53.631 --> 30:55.551
You're looking at her.

30:55.551 --> 30:57.431
I'm from the Coroner's Office and...

30:57.431 --> 31:02.111
And you've come about those
botched sea-burials.

31:02.111 --> 31:03.991
Well, we haven't done any.

31:03.991 --> 31:05.711
We don't have the custom.

31:05.711 --> 31:07.191
You mean you don't do them?

31:07.191 --> 31:09.791
No, I mean we don't have that
kind of customer.

31:10.871 --> 31:12.191
The rich kind.

31:12.191 --> 31:13.991
OK. Thanks for your time.

31:23.391 --> 31:25.311
I won't pay to be in your pocket.

31:25.311 --> 31:27.791
Why would you pay
to be in my pocket?

31:27.791 --> 31:30.431
We get our business two ways.

31:30.431 --> 31:33.111
The first's when you call us.

31:33.111 --> 31:35.991
Let's say a person dies
in a road accident.

31:35.991 --> 31:38.831
Police are called and they contact
your boss who then calls

31:38.831 --> 31:40.991
an undertaker to remove the body.

31:40.991 --> 31:42.471
I know how the job works.

31:42.471 --> 31:45.511
That's the most valuable
call in this business

31:45.511 --> 31:48.831
because when that person's loved one
organises the funeral,

31:48.831 --> 31:51.831
they'll need an undertaker
to prepare things.

31:51.831 --> 31:54.831
And your everyday Joe Public
doesn't know a great

31:54.831 --> 31:57.831
number of undertakers
so they tend not to shop around.

31:57.831 --> 32:01.151
So they use the undertaker
the coroner calls.

32:01.151 --> 32:02.711
Pays to be in her pocket.

32:02.711 --> 32:04.231
Yeah, well, Jane's honest.

32:04.231 --> 32:06.551
Not suggesting she isn't.

32:06.551 --> 32:09.071
But she could cast the net wider.

32:09.071 --> 32:11.151
There're a lot of undertakers
in this area,

32:11.151 --> 32:14.151
but she's only got
a handful on speed-dial.

32:14.151 --> 32:15.671
That breeds complacency.

32:18.031 --> 32:21.391
Maybe that's why these bodies
keep floating up.

32:21.391 --> 32:22.831
Let me see what I can do.

32:22.831 --> 32:25.471
I don't want preferential treatment.

32:25.471 --> 32:27.631
I just want it to be a fair
distribution of work.

32:27.631 --> 32:30.351
Well, to be honest with you,
you're the only person I've met

32:30.351 --> 32:32.311
today who hasn't tried
to scratch my back.

32:32.311 --> 32:33.431
See what I mean?

32:33.431 --> 32:34.591
What's your number?

32:38.151 --> 32:40.471
Don't get yourself mixed
up in gambling.

32:42.671 --> 32:44.991
I lost my first husband
to the horses.

32:55.191 --> 32:56.591
Hey.

32:56.591 --> 32:58.071
Ooh, you shouldn't have.

32:58.071 --> 32:59.311
Hey. I didn't.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.471
Right, OK,
so they keep DNA for three years.

33:02.471 --> 33:04.591
What?! I thought
they kept it forever.

33:04.591 --> 33:07.391
Used to, now it's three years.
After that, if you want it cleaned,

33:07.391 --> 33:09.391
you just fill out a form
and we have to ditch it.

33:09.391 --> 33:12.191
Yeah, but Kevin Burton was arrested.
Yeah, but he wasn't charged.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.351
That was back in 2012,
three years ago, right?

33:14.351 --> 33:16.471
And when did they ask to
have his record cleaned?

33:16.471 --> 33:17.551
The first of last month.

33:17.551 --> 33:19.991
So, I checked his dental records,
nothing there either.

33:19.991 --> 33:22.471
Well, if he wanted to vanish,
he's doing a good job.

33:22.471 --> 33:24.511
Yeah,
still doesn't explain the Rolex.

33:24.511 --> 33:27.431
I mean, if that body isn't Burton,
how come it's wearing Dora's fake?

33:27.431 --> 33:29.591
You see,
I don't think it is Burton's watch.

33:29.591 --> 33:30.911
Look, give us your wrist.

33:34.031 --> 33:36.911
How can a heavyweight boxer
have thinner wrists than you?

33:36.911 --> 33:38.511
Hands like shovels, he said.

33:38.511 --> 33:40.871
Come on, I'm pretty tough,
I can lift some weights.

33:40.871 --> 33:43.791
Davey, the only thing you ever
lift is a pint glass.

33:43.791 --> 33:46.271
Dora's not giving us
the full picture.

33:46.271 --> 33:49.191
Well, she's clearly not going to
give us any DNA voluntarily, is she,

33:49.191 --> 33:52.271
so, maybe I can get a warrant,
try and trap her that way.
TEXT ALERT

33:56.031 --> 33:57.831
Have you ever caught a lobster?

33:57.831 --> 33:58.951
Eh?

33:58.951 --> 34:02.151
You don't catch a lobster.
You let it catch itself.

34:02.151 --> 34:03.591
In a trap.

34:04.631 --> 34:07.431
Hey! You'll get fat!

34:20.351 --> 34:22.471
Hi, Dora.

34:22.471 --> 34:25.031
I'm afraid we still haven't managed
to identify the body.

34:25.031 --> 34:26.751
Oh, what more do you need?

34:26.751 --> 34:29.511
Well, are there any identifying
features that you can think of?

34:31.311 --> 34:33.511
Yeah. Yeah, his tooth.

34:33.511 --> 34:35.791
I can't think why
I didn't think of this before.

34:35.791 --> 34:40.431
He's got a false tooth there.
I think it's called a ca...nine?

34:40.431 --> 34:42.591
It got knocked out
in a boxing match.

34:42.591 --> 34:44.190
Well, it's up to me to confirm that

34:44.190 --> 34:46.351
the body we've discovered is
Kevin Burtons.

34:46.351 --> 34:49.110
To be certain I need you to tell me
whether he had any tattoos.

34:49.110 --> 34:50.751
Tattoos?

34:50.751 --> 34:53.231
Perhaps like this one?

34:53.231 --> 34:55.471
A tattoo of a barcode
on his right hip?

34:56.831 --> 34:58.951
Yeah, I, I think he did. Yeah.

34:58.951 --> 35:02.311
Do you have any photos
of that tattoo?

35:02.311 --> 35:04.391
No, I don't think so.

35:04.391 --> 35:06.511
Oh, that's a shame,
because if you did

35:06.511 --> 35:08.831
I'd be able to sign
the death certificate.

35:10.431 --> 35:12.351
Well, I'll see what I can do.

35:12.351 --> 35:13.911
Be in touch as soon as you can.

35:19.111 --> 35:20.551
SHE SIGHS

35:21.751 --> 35:23.271
Come on, Dora.

35:23.271 --> 35:25.231
You do realise that
if she drops herself in it,

35:25.231 --> 35:27.551
we're still left with
an unidentified body?

35:27.551 --> 35:29.431
I do,
but there's a big upside for me.

35:29.431 --> 35:30.591
What's that?

35:30.591 --> 35:32.671
Free steak.
DOOR OPENS

35:32.671 --> 35:35.751
Four sea-burials from
two undertakers,

35:35.751 --> 35:38.151
but none match your man.

35:38.151 --> 35:39.751
Which ones were they?

35:39.751 --> 35:41.751
These two were done
by Gravelle's in Brixham

35:41.751 --> 35:45.591
and Prince's in Torquay did two,
but they were both females, so.

35:45.591 --> 35:46.951
Nothing out of the ordinary?

35:46.951 --> 35:48.791
Not to do with the burials. Sorry.

35:48.791 --> 35:51.151
Prince likes a flutter
but that's no crime.

35:51.151 --> 35:53.191
Likes a what? Flutter.

35:53.191 --> 35:55.311
He gave me his number
on the back of a casino chit.

35:55.311 --> 35:56.351
Which casino?

35:59.951 --> 36:01.351
The Hippodrome.

36:01.351 --> 36:03.071
COMPUTER CHIMES

36:03.071 --> 36:04.391
When it rains...

36:04.391 --> 36:06.271
She's e-mailed?

36:06.271 --> 36:09.631
What a lovely picture of
Kevin Burton and a barcode tattoo.

36:09.631 --> 36:11.991
Has she done that with a biro?

36:11.991 --> 36:13.911
She puts the artist
into escape artist.

36:13.911 --> 36:15.431
Have you identified the dead body?

36:15.431 --> 36:17.111
We've identified A body.

36:17.111 --> 36:18.511
Yeah, but it's not dead.

36:20.311 --> 36:23.271
Tell me about your relationship
with Kevin Burton.

36:23.271 --> 36:25.071
I don't have one.

36:27.111 --> 36:29.671
Have you ever been to
the Hippodrome Casino?

36:30.831 --> 36:33.671
No. I don't think so.

36:34.911 --> 36:37.071
Would you like to have a look
at the video, please?

36:40.951 --> 36:42.311
Is this you,

36:42.311 --> 36:46.631
on the night of July the 12th 2012,
at the Hippodrome Casino?

36:48.311 --> 36:50.391
I don't remember.

36:50.391 --> 36:53.791
Is this you on that same night
having one too many?

36:57.431 --> 37:00.351
And is this you being thrown
out of the Hippodrome Casino

37:00.351 --> 37:02.271
by Kevin Burton on the same night?

37:07.831 --> 37:11.711
Now, the Coroner tells me that
you've always done exemplary work.

37:15.551 --> 37:17.151
Look, I didn't...

37:18.391 --> 37:21.031
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

37:23.471 --> 37:24.871
What happened?

37:26.551 --> 37:33.671
Well, my... my wife,
she died and I went...

37:35.751 --> 37:36.951
..off the rails.

37:38.031 --> 37:40.671
Gambling made me feel good,
but before I knew it

37:40.671 --> 37:43.631
I was in so much debt.

37:43.631 --> 37:46.351
It was his idea. Burton.

37:47.391 --> 37:52.831
He knew what I did for a living.
He used to call me The Man In Black.

37:55.111 --> 37:57.391
So, what part did you play
in the robbery?

37:57.391 --> 37:59.751
Nothing. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

37:59.751 --> 38:00.871
No. I didn't steal,

38:00.871 --> 38:07.791
I didn't steal anything.
I just...helped him...disappear.

38:08.791 --> 38:10.231
By botching sea-burials.

38:10.231 --> 38:11.871
I only did one.

38:13.271 --> 38:16.311
You see, I saw on the news
about those two bodies that had

38:16.311 --> 38:21.391
floated up and I thought, well,
why not another one?

38:21.391 --> 38:23.711
You see, he said to me that

38:23.711 --> 38:27.871
if I'd make it look like he'd died
then he'd pay off all my debts.

38:27.871 --> 38:32.711
So I put some stuff on a corpse
that came my way and I went

38:32.711 --> 38:35.471
and dropped it off the headland.

38:36.871 --> 38:40.591
You see, I knew that when that body
washed up it'd be next to

38:40.591 --> 38:43.511
impossible for you to identify
that it wasn't him.

38:43.511 --> 38:45.871
And without DNA...
HE SNAPS HIS FINGERS

38:45.871 --> 38:48.031
PRINCE CHUCKLES

38:48.031 --> 38:49.631
So who's body was it?

38:52.951 --> 38:54.551
Theodore Rosenstein.

38:55.951 --> 38:57.791
He was a terrible alcoholic.

38:58.831 --> 39:00.351
Homeless.

39:03.231 --> 39:05.631
He broke his neck
falling off a bench.

39:08.111 --> 39:10.311
And what about the other bodies?

39:10.311 --> 39:11.591
Not mine.

39:11.591 --> 39:16.511
No, no, someone else is out there
doing sea-burials on the cheap,

39:16.511 --> 39:19.511
but your Coroner, she's on to that.

39:21.631 --> 39:24.551
WHISPERS: I wouldn't mess with her
if I was you.

39:24.551 --> 39:25.871
Tell me about it.

39:34.111 --> 39:35.551
SIREN IN DISTANCE

40:03.911 --> 40:05.231
Hey, wait!

40:05.231 --> 40:08.031
It's DS Higgins. All units.
In pursuit of Kevin Burton.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.071
He's running!

40:28.911 --> 40:30.031
TYRES SQUEAL

40:34.231 --> 40:35.751
Come here! Where's my money?!

40:37.271 --> 40:39.151
Where's my ã75,000?

40:39.151 --> 40:42.231
Where's my money?
Hey! Don't even think about it.

40:42.231 --> 40:45.431
Don't even think about it.
Hand him over.

40:45.431 --> 40:46.791
Hand him over!

40:50.791 --> 40:52.551
You're pretty fast for a dead man.

40:52.551 --> 40:53.591
And lucky.

40:55.431 --> 40:56.751
Hands behind your back.

40:58.991 --> 41:00.351
Here she comes. OK.

41:04.951 --> 41:06.431
Good news or bad news?

41:06.431 --> 41:07.551
You what?

41:07.551 --> 41:09.631
Good news is, your boyfriend's
still alive.

41:09.631 --> 41:12.071
The bad news is, you're about
to be arrested

41:12.071 --> 41:14.311
for perverting
the course of justice.

41:14.311 --> 41:16.111
I do have one question, though.

41:16.111 --> 41:19.191
Did you move the boat to
the rocks before or after you

41:19.191 --> 41:20.511
reported him missing?

41:23.831 --> 41:26.271
Oh, come on, you deal with dead
things all the time.

41:26.271 --> 41:27.791
Must be second nature by now.

41:27.791 --> 41:30.911
I don't kill stuff, Mick,
it's dead when it arrives.

41:30.911 --> 41:35.191
Mick? Before it gets too busy, Mick!

41:35.191 --> 41:36.631
Davey!

41:36.631 --> 41:37.671
Yeah?

41:37.671 --> 41:41.031
Davey, here. You'll kill Jeff
for me, won't you?

41:41.031 --> 41:42.831
Why, what's he done?

41:42.831 --> 41:46.391
Jeff's Mick's lobster. Someone's
ordered him and Mick's too chicken.

41:46.391 --> 41:48.751
It's just,
we've become quite attached.

41:48.751 --> 41:50.191
You shouldn't've given it a name.

41:50.191 --> 41:52.431
I'm telling you, as soon as you
give something a name.

41:52.431 --> 41:53.751
Just cut its head off.

41:53.751 --> 41:56.551
That's cruel.
Drop it in boiling water.

41:57.831 --> 42:00.991
Here, look, Davey,
if you take care of Jeff

42:00.991 --> 42:02.631
your steaks are on the house.

42:02.631 --> 42:06.551
Michael Sturrock. What I've
got under here is pretty hot.

42:06.551 --> 42:09.151
If you don't come upstairs right now
and take it off me,

42:09.151 --> 42:11.271
you're getting Jeffed too.

42:12.271 --> 42:13.551
Mind the bar for me.

42:13.551 --> 42:14.911
I'm underage.

42:14.911 --> 42:16.151
I'll only be a minute.

42:17.951 --> 42:21.711
Right, come on then, Jeff.

42:23.231 --> 42:24.711
Close all your eyes.

42:29.791 --> 42:31.111
I can't.

42:32.911 --> 42:35.191
Mum, do the bar.
Why, where are you going?

42:35.191 --> 42:36.791
I'm breaking Jeff
out of this prison.

42:36.791 --> 42:38.431
He's going back into the sea.

42:41.831 --> 42:43.351
Did you get anything out of Burton?

42:43.351 --> 42:45.071
Yep. Full confession.

42:45.071 --> 42:46.311
How did you get him to talk?

42:46.311 --> 42:47.791
Oh, I just told him his girlfriend

42:47.791 --> 42:49.791
couldn't remember what
colour his eyes are.

42:49.791 --> 42:52.031
So I'm pretty sure that's not
going to last.

42:52.031 --> 42:55.511
And green, by the way,
Annette's eyes, they're green,

42:55.511 --> 42:57.831
I just, you know,
temporarily forgot. Course you did.

42:57.831 --> 43:00.071
Yeah, and why would you forget
something like that?

43:01.391 --> 43:05.311
So, er, I'll have a pint, please.
On the house? Oh.

43:27.591 --> 43:29.031
Bye, Jeff.

43:46.351 --> 43:48.431
All rise for Her Majesty's Coroner.
