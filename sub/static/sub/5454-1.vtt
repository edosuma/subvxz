WEBVTT

01:07.250 --> 01:08.290
Come on... Come on, kid.

01:09.090 --> 01:10.250
Don't...

01:10.630 --> 01:12.790
We're gonna make it. Fuck.

01:14.260 --> 01:16.390
Come on, Oleg. Stay with me.

01:17.850 --> 01:19.760
Come on.

01:23.940 --> 01:25.850
We're gonna make it.

01:25.940 --> 01:27.140
We're gonna crash.

02:14.170 --> 02:16.200
We're good.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.750
It's all looking very good.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.300
Nobody fucking moves.
Get down on the ground.

02:30.390 --> 02:32.180
Get down.
- Now, you cocksuckers.

02:32.270 --> 02:33.510
You heard him. Get down.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.510
You're making the biggest mistake...

02:36.230 --> 02:38.270
Shut up. Down, motherfuckers.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.200
Everybody. Eat the fucking floor.

02:42.070 --> 02:44.690
Now, very fucking carefully...

02:44.780 --> 02:48.400
reach into your jackets and take out
whatever you're packing...

02:48.500 --> 02:50.540
and slide it under the bed.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.000
Come on. All of you. Move it.

02:53.090 --> 02:56.210
Come on, fuckheads. Keep it moving. Now.

02:57.170 --> 02:59.460
You better spend it real quick, shit bags.

02:59.550 --> 03:01.590
You ain't long for this fucking world

03:01.680 --> 03:04.510
Yeah, right,
I'll be sure to have a Mai Tai on you.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.720
On all you goombah fucks.

03:08.850 --> 03:10.890
Ja, man. I'll have one on you too.

03:10.980 --> 03:13.310
Go, go, go. Come on.
- Move. Move. Move.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.940
Hurry up. Get going. Move.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.860
Let's go. Let's go.

03:17.950 --> 03:19.570
Come on

03:19.660 --> 03:20.940
Come on Now.

03:25.670 --> 03:26.950
Motherfucker.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.890
No, man.

03:42.730 --> 03:44.970
We don't give a fuck about these niggers.

03:45.060 --> 03:48.850
Now, you spill Perello blood,
you're deep six invested.

03:48.940 --> 03:49.970
Walk clean.

03:50.070 --> 03:52.030
Piss on Perello blood. Fuck him.

03:59.790 --> 04:00.820
I don't think so.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.620
Son of a bitch.

04:19.690 --> 04:20.970
I don't give up you fuck.

04:47.140 --> 04:51.180
What? Where you going, you fuck?
We can work this out. Let's talk.

04:51.270 --> 04:53.220
Fuck you.

04:55.350 --> 04:57.390
Shut... the fuck up.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.150
Where the fuck you reaching? Huh?

05:03.240 --> 05:04.270
Please...

05:04.360 --> 05:06.940
Tell you what, have a Mai Tai on me, huh?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.040
Fuck me. He's a cop.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.460
A fucking cop.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.510
Motherfucker.

05:21.590 --> 05:23.630
Get the shit and let's go. Now.

05:24.010 --> 05:26.050
Hurry the fuck up.

05:31.020 --> 05:32.890
Fucking dirty mooks

05:32.980 --> 05:34.260
Fuck's sakes.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.440
Is there one fucking honest cop
in this fucking city?

05:37.860 --> 05:39.600
Joey.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.950
Give me your gun.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.950
Take this shit and get rid of it,
and do me a favour.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.080
Don't fuck it up.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.420
Move.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.640
Never, dickwad.

06:08.770 --> 06:10.810
Sorry. Are you OK?

06:12.440 --> 06:15.150
Oh, shit. I didn't mean to do that.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.560
Hey, boss.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.640
You whacking off to the E channel again? Huh?

07:19.860 --> 07:21.560
Just wanna smell you. Just like that.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.310
You didn't call, you son of a bitch.

07:42.260 --> 07:45.010
Let me guess.
My pearls you've been promising?

07:46.100 --> 07:48.130
It's nothing, just a little recycling.

07:48.220 --> 07:49.300
Joey, come on.

07:49.390 --> 07:51.880
If Tommy ever found out about that...

07:51.980 --> 07:53.170
Ssh.

07:53.270 --> 07:56.310
Just remember,
it's just our little insurance policy, all right?

07:56.400 --> 08:00.650
Cos there's no way in hell I'm gonna be
thinking about getting some of this...

08:00.740 --> 08:03.820
looking at you through some glass window.
There's no fuckin' way.

08:35.070 --> 08:37.310
Now, Joey, come on. No, no, no, no.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.230
No. No.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.150
Come on, baby. Baby, look at me.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.700
What?
- Nicky's around.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.320
Nicky's busy.
I'll be quick and real quiet, come on.

08:45.410 --> 08:47.950
Quiet? I don't think so. Quick, I can believe.

08:48.670 --> 08:50.500
You know something, Mrs G?
- What?

08:50.590 --> 08:52.580
You're bad.

08:52.670 --> 08:54.710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:55.180 --> 08:57.300
I've got a rep.
- Yeah? You got a rep?

08:58.100 --> 08:59.920
You got a cruisey rep?

09:01.520 --> 09:04.190
I heard she likes to make it
on washing machines.

09:04.270 --> 09:06.260
On select occasions. What else?

09:08.900 --> 09:10.560
Oh, no, no, no. My sauce.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.140
My sauce is burning.
- Wait, that's how I like it.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.650
Yeah.

09:15.530 --> 09:17.410
Fuck. Come on.
- Hey.

09:18.240 --> 09:22.460
You use language like that,
you ain't getting no after-dinner dessert.

09:23.330 --> 09:26.250
Go find Nicky.
I think he's up in the bedroom with Oleg.

09:26.340 --> 09:30.250
Why's he always with that Russky kid?
Don't he have no other friends?

09:30.340 --> 09:33.540
Joey, you know, they get along. It's fine.
What do you want?

09:33.640 --> 09:36.510
I don't want him going over there no more.
That's what I want.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.640
I know. He knows.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.850
He knows.

09:44.780 --> 09:46.810
I'll go get him.

09:53.410 --> 09:55.450
Yo, Nick. Dinner.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.880
Oh, shit.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.800
Come on.

10:14.890 --> 10:16.550
Get down.

11:10.330 --> 11:12.370
Dinner.

11:13.170 --> 11:14.550
Can Oleg stay?

11:15.210 --> 11:17.090
It's already been three times this week.

11:17.180 --> 11:19.300
I'm sure his mom would like to have him home.

11:19.390 --> 11:21.880
It's OK. I'm not even hungry.

11:22.510 --> 11:24.550
I'll see you tomorrow. Go Razors.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.720
You, go wash up. Those hands are scary.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.440
Good night, Oleg.

11:32.530 --> 11:33.980
Good night, Mrs Gazelle.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.190
He's not even up there.

11:40.290 --> 11:43.370
They turned the basement
into a sports complex again.

11:43.460 --> 11:47.320
How many times am I supposed to tell him?
- What do you want? They're just boys.

11:58.470 --> 12:00.220
Dad, I won't do it again, I swear.

12:00.310 --> 12:02.100
Don't you expect me to make book on that.

12:02.190 --> 12:04.180
Now, go get your grandfather.

12:04.270 --> 12:06.310
I just washed my hands.

12:08.070 --> 12:09.350
All right.

12:14.660 --> 12:16.700
Hey, Nick.

12:17.870 --> 12:21.210
Razors and Blues Friday night. 120 yellow, pal.

12:21.290 --> 12:23.330
No way.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.830
It's gonna be a death match
between Chester and Erlich.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.580
They're going home in body bags.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.710
Red ice.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.510
Hey, can Oleg come?

12:32.600 --> 12:34.550
He's never been to one game, and he's...

12:34.640 --> 12:37.210
Not this time.
Sal could only score me a pair of tickets.

12:37.310 --> 12:38.970
Maybe next time, though.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.480
Go get your grandfather.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.500
Come on Get up

13:05.130 --> 13:07.170
Come on

13:08.720 --> 13:11.510
Come on, man. Make it different this time.

13:16.060 --> 13:18.100
Get up.

13:20.150 --> 13:22.190
Get up.

13:27.660 --> 13:29.700
Isaid, get up.

13:29.790 --> 13:31.950
What is this?

13:32.040 --> 13:34.030
Wolfgang Puck. It's your favourite.

13:34.750 --> 13:38.250
It's thick crust, you damn blyad.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.120
I cut off crust for you. It will be better.

13:45.010 --> 13:47.050
Bring me out a Moskova.

13:55.990 --> 13:57.860
Hey. Hey.

14:00.530 --> 14:02.160
Come here.

14:04.330 --> 14:06.370
Come here

14:08.130 --> 14:10.160
Come

14:12.710 --> 14:14.750
Watch this.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.340
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.210
I don't like cowboys.

14:20.310 --> 14:22.340
Come on.

14:22.430 --> 14:24.470
It's the Duke.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.390
Come, sit.

14:37.830 --> 14:40.030
When I was growing up in Kishinev...

14:40.120 --> 14:43.240
we had no VHS, no DVD back then.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.120
I remember...

14:46.210 --> 14:49.550
I did a job for this friend of my father.

14:50.380 --> 14:53.340
I pick-pocketed a key off this apparatchik.

14:53.430 --> 15:00.140
The man gave me as a reward
this children's projector.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.270
It came with three films.

15:03.610 --> 15:08.520
Speedy Gonzales, Tarzan Of The Apes,
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

15:08.610 --> 15:13.110
I watched that thing a thousand times.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.080
Anzor, it's getting cold.

15:25.670 --> 15:27.710
I was nine years old.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.090
I didn't know how long movies
were supposed to be.

15:31.180 --> 15:35.050
My version of The Cowboys,
it was only 10 minutes long.

15:35.140 --> 15:37.810
No John Wayne getting shot.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.280
Because it was for kids, they left that part out.

15:43.780 --> 15:49.780
I didn't know this... until I arrive in America...

15:49.870 --> 15:53.290
and see it on TV for the first time.

15:55.540 --> 16:01.500
I hate it. I want my 8mm back.

16:01.590 --> 16:04.210
Because on that one, the Duke lives.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.050
Some things were better in the old place.

16:10.980 --> 16:13.020
Not too many. Some things.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.440
Let me show you from the beginning.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.700
No, no, no. Not forward.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.200
This part's better.

16:32.460 --> 16:34.500
Without the Duke?

16:42.510 --> 16:44.170
Where are you going?

16:44.270 --> 16:46.300
You don't walk out on the Duke.

16:46.890 --> 16:48.930
Govnyak.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.940
She said he's always distracted
and he never finishes his work,

16:57.030 --> 16:59.070
and she wants to get him tested.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.740
She wants to get him tested? Tested for what?

17:02.830 --> 17:06.200
I think maybe er... attention disorder
or something.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.870
I'm not fucking ADD.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.370
Hey. You don't use that word
in front of your mother.

17:10.460 --> 17:13.420
What's wrong with ADD?
- The other one, smartass.

17:14.510 --> 17:16.050
He don't use that word, period.

17:16.140 --> 17:19.010
I don't wanna be on medication.
You can't make me take it.

17:19.100 --> 17:24.180
Don't even worry about it. There's no way in hell
anybody's gonna put you on meds, OK?

17:24.270 --> 17:27.470
Tell that teacher to come to the rink
and watch him wax that puck.

17:27.570 --> 17:31.270
That's perfect concentration every time.
- That's different, Joe.

17:31.360 --> 17:34.400
We're just trying to find out
what's going on with you.

17:34.490 --> 17:36.230
She said some great things too.

17:36.330 --> 17:39.610
She said that he's very bright,
that he's very creative.

17:39.710 --> 17:43.200
You left that part out before. I like that part.

17:43.290 --> 17:45.330
I got potential.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.350
You taking a collection down there?

18:25.720 --> 18:27.760
He must eat.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.470
The little prick insults the Duke...

18:36.480 --> 18:38.520
...he don't eat in this house.

18:42.610 --> 18:45.100
You hear me, you little snot face?

18:46.240 --> 18:47.950
Stay in your room.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.070
Jerk off to your fucking Razors.

18:50.620 --> 18:52.450
Faggot.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.290
He's a growing boy.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.640
What did I fucking say, sukka?

19:12.520 --> 19:14.560
He has to eat, Anzor.

19:14.650 --> 19:16.140
Please.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.360
Who puts food on this fucking table?

19:21.990 --> 19:24.030
Not you, blyad.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.030
I'm the big man of this house.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.160
When I say the little shit don't eat, he don't eat.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.290
Anzor.

19:34.010 --> 19:35.960
John Wayne was a faggot.

19:38.180 --> 19:42.180
So Vicki Gilleto told me she saw you walking
hand in hand with Jeannie's daughter.

19:42.270 --> 19:44.300
The fat one?

19:46.190 --> 19:48.230
Sounded like a gun.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.360
Hey, Nick, throw me some bread.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.900
Oh, shit, get down. Get down.

19:56.660 --> 19:58.400
Are you OK? You OK?

19:58.490 --> 19:59.900
Jesus, Joe. What the hell?

19:59.990 --> 20:01.790
Stay here. Motherfucker.

20:01.870 --> 20:05.700
Motherfucker. I'll kill that fucking piece of shit.
- Where are you going?

20:05.790 --> 20:07.750
You Russian piece of shit.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.710
Fucking cunt.

20:10.340 --> 20:13.180
Shoot my fucking house.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

20:13.260 --> 20:14.540
Dad, wait.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.170
Get back in the house.
Get back in the house.

20:18.270 --> 20:19.890
Get back in now. Go.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.680
Don't you move.

20:25.770 --> 20:26.890
You piece of shit.

20:26.980 --> 20:29.650
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- Nick, get inside.

20:29.740 --> 20:31.860
Joe. Joe. What's the matter with you?

20:31.950 --> 20:34.240
I just called 911. Leave it for the cops.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.480
There's a kid in here. Get back in the...

20:36.580 --> 20:39.250
I'm gonna kill you. Open the fucking door.

20:39.330 --> 20:41.370
Oleg's my friend.
- Get inside.

20:41.460 --> 20:43.780
Open the door.
- Joey, don't be a damn hero.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.750
Open up. It's Joey Gazelle from next door.
Open up.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.880
Open up.

20:50.140 --> 20:52.180
Get back. You get back.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.390
Where is he? Is he upstairs?

20:55.480 --> 20:56.890
His room.
- What?

20:56.980 --> 20:59.020
His room.
- Get down.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.530
What the fuck?

21:07.620 --> 21:10.070
Where's the kid? Huh?

21:16.460 --> 21:19.790
Where's the kid?
- Fuck him. I'm the one who's shot.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.920
Who is it? Is he still in the house?

21:22.010 --> 21:23.750
The little snotfuck ran out back.

21:25.180 --> 21:27.090
Oleg?

21:27.180 --> 21:29.720
Oleg? What are you trying to say?
Oleg shot you?

21:29.810 --> 21:31.850
What are you?

21:31.940 --> 21:33.970
A fucking idiot?

21:34.060 --> 21:36.100
I didn't do this to myself.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.890
The little prick would've done me too.

21:39.940 --> 21:41.980
Look at him.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.060
Jesus, it's a fucking miracle.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.720
Where'd he get the fucking piece?

22:12.820 --> 22:14.970
Fuck should I know?
- What, it wasn't yours?

22:15.070 --> 22:17.110
No. No way.

22:18.910 --> 22:21.450
I got a .357 in the safe out back.

22:22.370 --> 22:24.410
He had some fucking snub-nose thing.

22:26.370 --> 22:28.750
Silver. Chrome.

22:47.610 --> 22:49.930
Bullshit. Now you tell me.
I'm not playing around.

22:50.030 --> 22:52.810
We saw where you put the gun
but he didn't take anything.

22:52.910 --> 22:55.360
Not with me.
- Well, he went back, Nicky.

22:55.450 --> 22:57.900
I didn't know. I swear I didn't know.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.530
Come here. Listen to me. Listen to me.

23:01.620 --> 23:03.750
That piece? That's not just any hot piece.

23:03.830 --> 23:06.870
Tommy used it to burn a dirty cop.
- Oh, no. Joe...

23:06.960 --> 23:09.920
Yeah. Listen.
On top of it, that kid's out there right now.

23:10.010 --> 23:14.970
The cops are on their way. If they find the gun,
or they find the kid and he talks, I'm dead.

23:16.060 --> 23:18.100
Fuck.
- Calm down. Calm down.

23:18.180 --> 23:19.980
Calm down. We can get to him.

23:20.060 --> 23:23.100
You can get to the gun before the cops do.
- Oh, shit.

23:33.450 --> 23:35.080
Hey.

23:37.670 --> 23:40.120
Where are you gonna take him?
- Memorial.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.700
Hey, Mila, you should go with him.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.000
I'm gonna look for Oleg.
Me and Nicky are gonna go find him, OK?

23:46.090 --> 23:48.630
I'll get Teresa to stay here
in case he comes back.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.260
You should go.
- Thanks, Joey.

23:50.350 --> 23:52.060
Yeah, no problem.
- I'm sorry.

23:52.140 --> 23:54.680
We're gonna find him. Don't worry about it.

24:00.610 --> 24:01.640
Motherfuck.

24:06.410 --> 24:08.450
Come on.

24:15.210 --> 24:17.830
Police officers. Sir, do you live here?

24:17.920 --> 24:19.960
No. No, actually I live next door.

24:20.050 --> 24:22.670
I heard gunshots,
so I came to see what's going on.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.500
What did you see?
- Er...

24:26.560 --> 24:30.140
Isaw Anzor, my neighbour, in the kitchen.
He'd been shot.

24:30.230 --> 24:33.100
See who did it?
- No, he was screaming in Russian.

24:33.190 --> 24:35.940
His wife asked me to stick around for the kid.

24:36.030 --> 24:38.060
You don't know who shot him?
- No.

24:38.650 --> 24:40.860
I'm gonna need to take a statement outside.

24:40.950 --> 24:43.070
I can't have you messing up the scene.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.200
Hey, check it out.

24:48.170 --> 24:51.120
I don't see nothing inside.
Maybe all the way back.

24:52.590 --> 24:54.630
Forget it. Leave it for Forensics.

24:58.300 --> 25:00.340
Sir, I need for you to wait outside.

25:01.350 --> 25:03.390
All right. No problem.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.610
I'm fucking having a heart attack.

25:16.410 --> 25:20.110
Breathe.
- I gotta find this kid. I gotta find this kid tonight.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.540
Nick, I need to know places.
Ineed to know hideouts.

25:23.620 --> 25:26.410
Go to your room and make a list.
Nick, make a list.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.620
OK.
- I'm not fucking around, Nick.

25:28.710 --> 25:30.870
Joe, just take it easy.

25:30.970 --> 25:32.290
There's no fucking time.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.600
I want you to wait next door.

25:42.690 --> 25:44.730
The second he shows up, call me.

25:50.650 --> 25:53.410
I can't have to keep fucking talking to the cops.

25:53.490 --> 25:56.160
You understand me?
The fucking gun is on the street.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.700
This whole fucking thing's about to blow up.

25:58.790 --> 26:02.410
If Tommy or any of those fucking guys
find out about it I'm a dead man

26:02.500 --> 26:04.540
You gotta fucking help me

26:06.340 --> 26:08.380
Yeah, if I fucking have to.

26:17.020 --> 26:19.090
Grab your jacket. We're going for a ride.

26:29.410 --> 26:32.530
All right, Nick.
I want you to stay in the car, all right?

26:32.620 --> 26:34.360
Don't get out for anything.

26:34.460 --> 26:38.670
If I'm not back in one hour, call your mother.
She'll come and get you, OK?

26:59.650 --> 27:01.690
Excuse me.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.740
Who's in the other room?
Is that Yugorsky, gunshot victim?

27:05.830 --> 27:09.110
Teenager. DUI car wreck.
I think they just lost a GSW in 3.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.500
Lost?

27:11.580 --> 27:13.540
He's dead?
- Yeah.

27:13.630 --> 27:15.750
No, wait, he took a bullet right here.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.790
No, major trauma to chest.
He's been in surgery all day.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.760
The guy was a cop.

27:20.840 --> 27:24.430
Oh, wait. Yeah, they did bring someone in
about 40 minutes ago.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.720
OR number 2. He's gone upstairs already.

27:26.810 --> 27:27.920
That's this way?

27:56.720 --> 27:58.760
Can I help you, Dr Donaldson?

27:58.850 --> 28:00.800
Yeah, the cops are waiting outside.

28:00.890 --> 28:03.300
They need to run a match on this bullet asap.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.100
I'll make sure they get it right away.

28:23.710 --> 28:25.750
Excuse me.

28:35.760 --> 28:38.430
You looking for this? Yugorsky? GSW shoulder?

28:41.650 --> 28:43.690
You gotta help me find him, Nick.

28:44.900 --> 28:47.470
What are you gonna do to him?
- I'm not gonna do nothing.

28:47.570 --> 28:50.320
I just need to get my gun back
and bring him home.

28:51.490 --> 28:53.530
You sure?

28:54.200 --> 28:56.240
Talk to me, Nick.

28:57.040 --> 28:59.990
There's this old abandoned rec centre
in the park

29:00.080 --> 29:03.290
Me and Oleg would hang out there sometimes
read comics

29:03.380 --> 29:05.290
He might be there

29:27.120 --> 29:30.280
Nice gun.

29:41.130 --> 29:43.170
Detective Rydell, Narcotics.

29:44.090 --> 29:46.130
I already made a statement.

29:47.930 --> 29:49.970
I don't know who the shooter was.

29:50.770 --> 29:52.510
Fucking niggers all look the same.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.140
Yeah. Anzor Yugorsky.

29:55.230 --> 29:57.270
Any relation to lvan Yugorsky?

29:57.360 --> 29:58.850
My uncle.

29:58.950 --> 30:02.440
The Czar of Brighton Beach.
I've been to his club a couple of times.

30:02.530 --> 30:03.910
Nice joint.

30:03.990 --> 30:06.030
He even sang a few songs.

30:06.700 --> 30:08.330
He sings like a fucking toad.

30:08.410 --> 30:12.200
Well, Sinatra he's not,
but he's a man with a serious reputation.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.420
He has a lot of enemies.
- Bullshit.

30:15.510 --> 30:19.090
I told you it was just some fucking crackhead.

30:19.180 --> 30:21.880
Yeah. Well, I spoke to the officers on the scene.

30:21.970 --> 30:23.960
There was no sign of forced entry.

30:24.060 --> 30:26.730
But they did find some interesting shit out back.

30:26.810 --> 30:30.100
Six cases of NyQuil,
and it ain't even cold season.

30:30.190 --> 30:32.560
What do you think a search warrant's
gonna turn up?

30:59.430 --> 31:01.470
Come on. Where?
- It's this way.

31:02.270 --> 31:04.310
Let's go. Come on.

31:06.860 --> 31:08.900
Come on.

31:10.570 --> 31:12.610
Go, go, go.

31:15.370 --> 31:17.280
This way.

31:18.160 --> 31:22.540
Be cool. And let me do all the talking.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.290
I'm gonna get you out of here.

31:27.590 --> 31:29.630
Help you?
- Yeah.

31:30.050 --> 31:32.090
How much you got?

31:33.720 --> 31:35.630
Oh, I got a lot.

31:38.310 --> 31:39.310
Yes.

31:46.610 --> 31:48.650
Oleg, it's Nicky. Are you in there?

31:57.750 --> 31:59.790
This the spot?
- Mm.

32:02.510 --> 32:04.460
Hey, where's the stash?

32:04.550 --> 32:06.590
Last stall, motherfucker.

32:07.350 --> 32:09.380
Find the stash. Find it.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.720
Go on. Find it.

32:13.810 --> 32:15.850
Find it.

32:29.160 --> 32:32.080
We're gonna search this entire park.
He might still be around.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.210
What the fuck do you think you're doin',
white boy?

32:42.300 --> 32:45.800
All right, drop it, or I'll fucking waste the midget.
Come on.

32:45.890 --> 32:49.640
Go ahead. He's just a tag-along.

32:49.730 --> 32:52.810
Plug 'em, Dell. Fuck it, man. Fuck 'em up.

33:13.880 --> 33:15.670
All right, stay right by me.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.500
Right here. Against the wall.

33:17.590 --> 33:19.800
Don't you move. Stay right there.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.970
I didn't do nothing, Officer. I just came to...

33:27.060 --> 33:29.550
Put your fucking head
against the fucking stall.

33:29.650 --> 33:31.560
Put your fucking head there.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.730
Oleg.

33:36.780 --> 33:38.360
I told you to stay outside.

33:38.450 --> 33:42.200
Did you find him?
- Get the fuck outside. Get out of here.

33:42.290 --> 33:43.750
I'm talking to you. What did you see?

33:45.790 --> 33:49.130
Find a gun? You find a silver gun?
Did you find a fucking silver gun?

33:49.210 --> 33:50.490
I-I-I got no gun.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.890
You wanna study for the GED? Here.

34:16.160 --> 34:18.700
Look what you done to my fucking ride, bitch.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.490
Jesus, please, baby. Please.

34:23.670 --> 34:27.920
I've only been taking one class.
One class two hours a week.

34:28.010 --> 34:30.130
Istill got time to be pulling tricks.

34:31.010 --> 34:33.390
Three Gs I fronted you
for these fucking airbags.

34:34.270 --> 34:36.010
And what do I get in return?

34:36.100 --> 34:37.980
Fucking night school?
- I'll quit.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.600
I'm super proud of you
for showing some initiative.

34:41.690 --> 34:44.020
Maybe I'll even come to your graduation.

34:44.110 --> 34:47.400
But first you're gonna give me back
my fucking property.

34:57.130 --> 35:00.000
You learn how to use that
watching Sesame Street?

35:01.550 --> 35:03.590
You ain't even holding it right.

35:05.890 --> 35:08.340
What's the matter, kid? You got the shakes?

35:13.150 --> 35:14.180
Whoops.

35:15.270 --> 35:17.650
Now I'm gonna put a smile on your face, boy.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.110
Cheek to cheek.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.690
You're gonna be the happiest little brat
in school.

35:22.780 --> 35:24.320
Say cheese.

35:26.080 --> 35:31.040
Who's laughing now, you fucking grey meat
limp-dick motherfucker?

35:31.130 --> 35:32.370
Mac Daddy.

35:32.460 --> 35:34.330
Who's mackin' now bitch?

35:34.420 --> 35:36.460
PuÃ±eta.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.840
You got some cojones, kid.

35:57.360 --> 35:59.400
Let me see your fingers, son.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.200
Is this... Hey. Is this your son?

36:05.710 --> 36:07.750
I'm taking care of him tonight, OK?

36:08.420 --> 36:12.080
Unless you have the number of his doctor
and I can get a prescription over the phone,

36:12.170 --> 36:13.920
you'll have to take him to Emergency.

36:14.010 --> 36:17.210
If you want me to call you a cab...
- I don't need no fucking cab.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.880
Ineed some spray shit for him.

36:18.970 --> 36:22.670
That spray shit is a controlled substance,
ma'am, so what can I tell you?

36:24.730 --> 36:27.730
Keep the change.
- I can't... This is stupid. I can't do this.

36:27.820 --> 36:31.020
Listen, why don't we go in the back
and talk about it, OK?

36:32.410 --> 36:34.650
Look, lady...
- I'll take care of you.

36:35.950 --> 36:38.900
There's nothing I can do, lady.
- There's nothing you can do?

36:39.000 --> 36:41.370
Take him to Emergency.
- OK.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.740
OK.

36:42.830 --> 36:45.290
Nothing you can fucking do?

36:45.380 --> 36:48.250
Get what he needs. Now.

36:49.170 --> 36:51.080
It's Beclovent.
- Yeah, I know.

36:51.180 --> 36:52.260
Beclovent, bitch.

36:52.890 --> 36:54.510
Come on, let's just go back.

36:54.600 --> 36:55.970
No.

36:56.060 --> 36:58.180
If he turns up, your mom's gonna call.

37:01.150 --> 37:03.390
Tee.

37:04.980 --> 37:07.190
Sal.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.270
Yeah.

37:14.410 --> 37:17.700
Do girls really get naked in there?
- You'll find out when you're 21.

37:17.790 --> 37:20.280
I've seen Mom naked. It's no big deal.

37:22.170 --> 37:24.250
Trust me on this one. It's always a big deal.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.170
Stay here.

37:38.820 --> 37:40.860
# Funky dance music

38:02.930 --> 38:04.970
What?

38:05.060 --> 38:07.260
It's taken care of.

38:07.350 --> 38:09.390
Oh. It's taken care of. Lucky us.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.140
Guys sit down Have a seat

38:13.230 --> 38:15.270
Don't be shy.

38:16.780 --> 38:20.730
They make a good Mai Tai for a twat bar,
but seriously overpriced.

38:20.820 --> 38:23.440
Two million dollars for a round of drinks.

38:23.530 --> 38:25.570
And the pussy ain't even that hot.

38:26.500 --> 38:30.740
Jody, I'm doin' business here.
Jody. Come on, get the fuck out of here.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.410
Two million dollars.

38:32.500 --> 38:35.340
Suck a dick, you prick bastard.
You don't have shit on us.

38:35.420 --> 38:37.330
What do you think of this?

38:37.430 --> 38:41.260
Cops never found these at the scene.
Just two dead narcs and three dead Jamaicans.

38:41.350 --> 38:44.260
Ballistics is gonna reveal the slugs
that killed my partners...

38:44.350 --> 38:46.340
didn't come from the Jamaicans.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.510
So there were others involved.

38:48.610 --> 38:51.560
As for myself... erm... I was never there.

38:51.650 --> 38:52.520
Well...

38:52.610 --> 38:55.810
dead guys tell no tales.

38:55.910 --> 38:59.360
Yeah. Why don't you ask your pal here?

39:01.500 --> 39:03.120
What the fuck you talkin' about?

39:03.210 --> 39:06.040
You blew my partner Stevie's balls off
with a .38 snub nose.

39:06.130 --> 39:08.120
A real distinctive piece.

39:08.210 --> 39:11.130
Stainless. Polished up like a spic's hubcap.

39:12.630 --> 39:14.670
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

39:15.470 --> 39:17.880
I think you gave him the gun
to dump in the river

39:18.770 --> 39:22.380
Now I'm assuming that he never
got around to it because two hours ago...

39:22.480 --> 39:24.970
his next-door neighbour
took a slug in the shoulder

39:25.070 --> 39:27.980
The shooter was the guy's 10-year-old stepson.

39:28.070 --> 39:30.520
Who was over at Gazelle's house
two hours earlier.

39:30.610 --> 39:32.860
What the fuck you tryin' to do here? Huh?

39:32.950 --> 39:34.320
You tryin' to fuckin' play us?

39:34.410 --> 39:36.730
You're wasting your time, and this is bullshit.

39:36.830 --> 39:38.870
Bullshit? Bullshit, huh?

39:39.790 --> 39:41.830
This punk, Anzor Yugorsky?

39:41.920 --> 39:44.490
He describes the gun to me in vivid detail.

39:44.590 --> 39:48.500
Makes mention it's a snub nose
with a serious shine to it.

39:49.430 --> 39:53.050
The fuck is this guy talkin' about?
- He's talkin' about a fuckin' shiny gun.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.970
Big deal. There's a thousand on the street.
It ain't the piece.

39:56.060 --> 40:00.850
Oh, yeah? What were you doing at the hospital
when they brought Yugorsky in? Huh?

40:00.940 --> 40:03.180
Sniffing around Emergency

40:03.280 --> 40:04.650
You know what I figure?

40:04.740 --> 40:07.990
I figure you were there to pull a switch
on the slug they took out of him

40:08.070 --> 40:11.110
My wife asked me to go to the hospital.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.490
She was concerned, in a neighbourly way.
She wanted me...

40:13.580 --> 40:17.000
All right, you know what? Enough bullshit.
I expect to find a bag...

40:17.080 --> 40:19.750
in this locker at Down Neck Station by midnight.

40:19.840 --> 40:22.710
If the bag is not there one minute after.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.290
I'm taking you all down any fuckin' way I can.

40:25.390 --> 40:27.510
Even if I have to manufacture the case

40:27.600 --> 40:31.380
And you know I will.
Cos I got the toughest mob in the world.

40:31.480 --> 40:33.520
I'm the law.

40:50.210 --> 40:53.120
Right, stay put. I'm gonna grab you a burger.

40:53.210 --> 40:56.910
I'm not hungry.
- You didn't finish dinner, I'll grab you something.

40:57.010 --> 40:59.050
Stay here.

40:59.130 --> 41:00.840
Dad?

41:02.220 --> 41:04.340
Don't go in there. Let's just go home.

41:05.350 --> 41:07.390
It's gonna be all right.

41:10.520 --> 41:11.720
No, it's not.

41:13.730 --> 41:16.490
Hey, Frankie. How you doing?
- Hey. How are ya?

41:16.570 --> 41:18.610
It's good to see you.
- Sit, Joe.

41:19.450 --> 41:21.360
How you doin,' guys?
- Hi, Joey.

41:21.450 --> 41:23.360
How you doing?

41:24.160 --> 41:26.910
You want some coffee, or somethin' to eat?
- Nah, I'm good.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.710
But I got my boy waiting out in the car.

41:28.790 --> 41:31.330
I wanna get him a burger.
- Tony, take care of that.

41:31.420 --> 41:34.710
Yeah, Tony, get him some fries
and a strawberry shake.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.960
Don't scare him. He don't know you're coming.

41:41.180 --> 41:42.380
So Joe

41:42.480 --> 41:45.430
I got off the phone with lvan
about this thing with his nephew.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.060
I told you, it's not the fuckin' piece.

41:49.320 --> 41:52.770
Look, everybody knows the nephew
is a brain -fried reprobate.

41:52.860 --> 41:54.820
Yeah, whatever. He's a tweaker piece of shit.

41:54.910 --> 41:57.200
And he's cooking meth in his backyard.

41:57.280 --> 42:00.240
It's just a matter of time
before he blows up the neighbourhood.

42:00.330 --> 42:03.830
We know this.
But it's a sensitive issue with me, Joe.

42:04.920 --> 42:07.750
I'm in bed with Yugorsky on this gasoline deal.

42:07.840 --> 42:08.620
Hey.

42:08.710 --> 42:09.910
It's a good deal.

42:10.010 --> 42:12.550
I don't wanna rock the boat.
- Oh, fuck that.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.790
Fuck those Russian cunts. Huh?

42:14.890 --> 42:19.270
Pop, it's the fuckin' narc
that's got his dick in our ass.

42:19.350 --> 42:21.340
Hey.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.730
Calm down Tommy

42:24.780 --> 42:27.860
You see, Joe, the tweaker's got it in his head...

42:27.950 --> 42:31.070
that maybe you were looking to knock him
out of the cooking business...

42:31.160 --> 42:33.150
and helped the boy out.

42:33.240 --> 42:34.790
Made a piece available to him.

42:36.250 --> 42:39.000
I would never use a kid to do something like that.

42:39.790 --> 42:40.870
Never.

42:40.960 --> 42:43.000
All right, all right, look.

42:44.380 --> 42:47.000
I made a personal reassurance to Yugorsky...

42:47.090 --> 42:50.340
that I will have my entire crew in the street
out looking for that kid.

42:50.430 --> 42:53.680
Now, in the interest of professional harmony...

42:54.810 --> 42:57.270
...I think we all wanna get our story straight.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.390
You agree don't you Joe?

43:04.530 --> 43:07.370
One hamburger and you're out of my life.
That's it.

43:07.450 --> 43:09.360
Oleg.

43:13.620 --> 43:14.820
Oh shit.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.460
Hey, kid.

43:16.540 --> 43:19.830
How you doing?
Your old man sent this stuff out for you.

43:19.920 --> 43:21.420
Thanks.

43:21.510 --> 43:25.640
Ain't it a little late for you to be out?
I have twins your age. They're in bed by now.

43:25.720 --> 43:28.210
What are you, like, nine?

43:28.310 --> 43:30.050
Ten.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.390
And a half.

43:31.480 --> 43:32.890
I gotta go to the bathroom.

43:42.370 --> 43:44.690
Hey, Joey.

43:44.790 --> 43:47.160
Looks like your kid don't listen too well.

43:50.420 --> 43:52.460
Must run in the family.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.250
Hey, Nicky. Get over here.

43:56.340 --> 43:58.380
Get over here

44:03.140 --> 44:05.180
What you doing? I told you to wait in the car.

44:05.270 --> 44:07.890
I had to go to the bathroom.
- How you doing, Nicky?

44:07.980 --> 44:10.060
Want some Gummy Bears?

44:10.150 --> 44:12.110
Hey, Nicky.

44:12.190 --> 44:14.020
You wouldn't by chance...

44:14.110 --> 44:16.230
know where your friend got that gun?

44:16.320 --> 44:17.860
Would ya?

44:17.950 --> 44:19.780
No.

44:20.700 --> 44:22.490
I have to go to the bathroom.

44:22.580 --> 44:24.620
OK
- Nick, you go to the bathroom.

44:31.380 --> 44:33.870
Have you decided yet?

44:33.970 --> 44:36.760
I have a bus to catch and... Oh, no.

44:36.850 --> 44:39.470
I'll have a cheeseburger and a Coke.

44:39.560 --> 44:42.050
I gotta go to the bathroom.

44:42.140 --> 44:44.300
Don't worry, we're gonna take care of the cop.

44:44.400 --> 44:46.440
I know.
- OK.

44:55.280 --> 44:56.990
Where is it?

45:11.600 --> 45:13.630
Hey, Nick.

45:14.470 --> 45:16.300
Where the hell are you?
- Almost done.

45:17.390 --> 45:19.970
Razors with razors.

45:24.440 --> 45:27.480
Come on, wash your hands.
We gotta get out of here. Come on.

45:38.630 --> 45:40.120
Fuck.

45:44.090 --> 45:46.550
Hey, sweetie. How you doing?

45:47.390 --> 45:49.010
All right, Nick, listen to me.

45:49.100 --> 45:51.550
I want you to think about
where your friend might be,

45:51.640 --> 45:54.350
because the others are looking for him
and if they find him...

45:54.440 --> 45:56.730
They won't find the gun.
- What did you say?

45:58.070 --> 46:00.110
What did you say?

46:03.910 --> 46:06.740
Don't mess with me.
I want you to fuckin' talk to me now.

46:06.830 --> 46:10.080
Promise me you won't hurt him.
- I don't have time for this shit.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.950
Now fuckin' tell me.
- Promise.

46:12.040 --> 46:15.160
Promise you what? What? I promise.
Iswear to God.

46:15.250 --> 46:17.500
I'm not gonna hurt your friend.
Come on. Tell me.

46:17.590 --> 46:19.670
Just tell me what you know.

46:39.660 --> 46:41.700
Come on.

46:48.580 --> 46:50.330
This one here?

47:32.010 --> 47:34.330
Where is it?
I thought you said you put it in there.

47:34.430 --> 47:36.340
I did. I put it right...
- Then where is it?

47:36.430 --> 47:40.220
I thought you said you put it in the tank.
- I put it in here.

47:40.310 --> 47:41.510
Oh, shit.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.140
Which one did you put it in, Nick? Huh?

47:44.230 --> 47:46.270
Which one did you put it in?

47:51.200 --> 47:53.320
Goddamn it, Nicky.

47:53.410 --> 47:55.730
Why did you lie to me? Why did you lie to me?

47:55.830 --> 47:57.290
I didn't.

47:57.370 --> 47:59.410
Why did you lie to me?
- I'm not...

47:59.500 --> 48:02.500
Why did you lie to me?
- I'm not fucking lying. I put it in there.

48:02.590 --> 48:05.460
You just fuckin' killed me, Nick.

48:05.550 --> 48:07.590
You just fuckin' killed me.

48:52.940 --> 48:54.400
I want you to keep an eye open.

48:54.480 --> 48:58.480
If you see anybody coming,
I want you to cough really loud, all right?

49:09.960 --> 49:13.370
You're like a broken record.
- I'm telling you, you gotta see this thing.

49:13.460 --> 49:15.500
You better not be jerking my chain.

49:15.590 --> 49:18.920
What are you doin' here, kid?
- I was looking for the bathroom.

49:19.010 --> 49:22.460
Even the kid thinks it's a shithole back here.
- Shut up, Ralphie.

49:22.560 --> 49:23.880
All right, listen.

49:23.970 --> 49:25.430
You go on out through that door,

49:25.520 --> 49:27.510
turn left, go all the way down to the end,

49:27.600 --> 49:29.430
turn left again, and you're there.

49:29.520 --> 49:30.720
You got it?

49:34.360 --> 49:36.980
Come on.
- Er... which door?

49:39.240 --> 49:41.280
Come here, kid. Come here.

49:43.910 --> 49:45.950
Hey, Yolanda. Wait up.

49:46.580 --> 49:50.910
Where you going with my cheesecake?
- It's for paying customers Not you

49:59.600 --> 50:01.390
I've got your number, fucker.

50:11.650 --> 50:14.530
Forget it. I ain't dragging your butt
across no state lines.

50:18.450 --> 50:20.490
Look, baba, why don't you just go home?

50:20.580 --> 50:23.540
I bet you things are not as bad
as you think they are.

50:29.050 --> 50:32.250
Come on, baba.

50:36.350 --> 50:37.970
Oh, mother...

50:38.060 --> 50:40.600
Hands where we can see 'em.

50:40.690 --> 50:42.310
Over here.

50:42.400 --> 50:44.440
Run. Run, little man. Run.

50:49.120 --> 50:50.940
Hey.

50:52.870 --> 50:54.910
Get off. Get off.

51:17.940 --> 51:19.980
Do you know these guys?

51:28.490 --> 51:30.530
Yeah.
- Babe?

51:31.790 --> 51:34.460
Where the hell are you?
- I'm takin' care of things

51:35.420 --> 51:38.500
Forget about it - they picked up Oleg
at a bus station with a hooker.

51:38.590 --> 51:40.830
Who picked him up?

51:40.930 --> 51:42.800
The cops?
- Yeah.

51:42.890 --> 51:45.180
Jesus Christ, this is fuckin' bullshit.

51:45.260 --> 51:46.760
Hey.
- Fuck.

51:46.850 --> 51:48.680
Hey. You got Nicky with you?

51:48.770 --> 51:50.100
Yeah, he's right here.

51:50.190 --> 51:52.640
Then stop using your mouth around him.

51:52.730 --> 51:55.190
And bring my son home. Now.

51:55.280 --> 51:58.810
Yeah. That's what I'm doing.
I'm bringing him home right now.

52:08.370 --> 52:11.040
Ah. Do you mind?

52:11.130 --> 52:13.170
I'm feeling kind of parched.

52:15.720 --> 52:17.420
Big game Friday night.

52:17.510 --> 52:19.220
I bet you're excited about that, huh?

52:19.300 --> 52:22.750
It's gonna be red ice,
and plenty of blue shirt body bags.

52:22.850 --> 52:24.890
Am I right?

52:26.650 --> 52:29.850
Look... I could help you, kid.

52:29.940 --> 52:31.680
You and your mom, if need be.

52:31.780 --> 52:34.270
Now I could get that prick out of your life.

52:35.110 --> 52:37.240
Lock him up. I could do that, I'm a cop.

52:39.540 --> 52:41.990
All you have to do
is tell me where you found the gun.

52:42.080 --> 52:44.120
And where you stashed it.

52:45.420 --> 52:46.960
That's it.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.080
What do you say?

52:49.170 --> 52:51.210
You'll let me help you.

52:54.970 --> 52:57.010
Get out of here, Mila.

52:57.100 --> 52:59.770
You know? Go to a shelter.

52:59.850 --> 53:01.890
I can get you an address.

53:03.270 --> 53:05.310
You don't understand.

53:06.940 --> 53:08.980
I belong to him.

53:09.820 --> 53:11.860
No. No.

53:11.950 --> 53:13.990
No, no, I don't understand.

53:18.620 --> 53:20.660
I was prostitute in Moscow.

53:24.300 --> 53:30.000
Yugorsky Escort Service offered to
bring girls over with promise of big bucks.

53:31.600 --> 53:35.430
We would owe 50 thousand dollars.
You know, pay back through work.

53:38.440 --> 53:40.390
I take offer.

53:40.480 --> 53:42.520
Not tell them I'm pregnant.

53:44.110 --> 53:46.150
When they find out...

53:48.120 --> 53:50.150
...they insist I have an abortion.

53:51.240 --> 53:53.280
I tell them no.

53:55.710 --> 53:57.750
They send Anzor to kill me.

53:59.880 --> 54:01.920
Anzor's not a killer.

54:03.430 --> 54:06.790
He's not... a hard man like big Yugorsky.

54:10.020 --> 54:12.060
He thinks...

54:13.600 --> 54:15.640
...he thinks he's John Wayne.

54:19.110 --> 54:21.150
Wants to do right thing.

54:22.410 --> 54:27.480
He goes against his uncle, and tells
big man Yugorsky he will pay off my debt.

54:29.960 --> 54:32.000
His uncle refuses...

54:32.920 --> 54:34.960
...and tells him...

54:35.050 --> 54:37.080
he will send others to kill me.

54:38.090 --> 54:40.130
Set example.

54:42.010 --> 54:44.050
So Anzor make me wife.

54:45.430 --> 54:48.100
Big man Yugorsky can't kill his nephew's wife.

54:52.400 --> 54:57.390
But he... tells Anzor to leave Little Odessa.

54:57.490 --> 55:01.570
He's no longer working for Yugorsky family.

55:07.670 --> 55:09.830
I'm gonna get you the name of a shelter.

55:20.810 --> 55:22.850
You OK?

55:23.730 --> 55:27.510
This ain't right, Joe.
He don't need to be put through this.

55:27.610 --> 55:30.690
Hey, Nick, I'm proud of you.
You done good, all right?

55:40.160 --> 55:41.950
I'm gonna head up to Community Hills.

55:42.040 --> 55:46.450
Cops don't got the gun yet but I may have
a line on it so I'm gonna go over there.

55:46.550 --> 55:48.840
I'm scared, Joe.

55:48.920 --> 55:52.210
I am pissed at you, and I am scared.

55:52.300 --> 55:54.340
Equal measures.

56:00.980 --> 56:02.390
Be careful.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.990
Hey.
- Hey.

56:15.080 --> 56:17.040
Just got word. The cops picked up the kid.

56:17.120 --> 56:20.660
Anything you still wanna tell us?
- Tell you what? There's nothing to tell.

56:21.670 --> 56:24.130
Where you headed, Joe?
- Erm...

56:24.220 --> 56:27.300
I was supposed to head to the store
and pick up some milk and eggs.

56:27.390 --> 56:29.880
In all the excitement I forgot to do it, so...

56:29.970 --> 56:32.300
Hm.

56:32.390 --> 56:35.260
Yugorsky's gonna call us
when he talks to the kid.

56:36.730 --> 56:38.770
Don't go too far...

56:40.190 --> 56:42.230
Later, Joe.
- Yeah, see ya.

56:44.820 --> 56:47.690
Hey, Tee. Looking fucking good.

56:55.710 --> 56:59.210
He keeps giving me this bullshit story
about finding the gun...

56:59.300 --> 57:01.670
in some abandoned locker in school.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.300
What do you want me to do?

57:03.390 --> 57:06.220
The little fucker shot me.
He ain't gonna spill dick to me.

57:06.310 --> 57:09.390
You know,
I don't think I'm being clear enough here.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.520
You know what I mean?

57:12.650 --> 57:14.690
Let me be crystal clear.

57:16.070 --> 57:20.480
You get the boy to give up Gazelle
or I'm closing shop on your tweaker ass...

57:20.570 --> 57:22.730
and I'm taking you down fucking hard.

57:22.830 --> 57:24.490
Understand me?

57:30.750 --> 57:32.580
Hey, cowboy.

57:33.460 --> 57:35.500
Wanna go get some ice cream?

57:36.760 --> 57:38.800
# Rap

57:57.030 --> 57:59.070
Get the fuck away from my car.

58:06.840 --> 58:09.410
Hey. Hey, I'm looking for Manny Perez.
- He's not here.

58:09.500 --> 58:12.960
No. Oh, my God. I've never seen him.

58:13.050 --> 58:15.340
Manny? Where the fuck is he?
- He's not here.

58:15.430 --> 58:18.180
Where is he? Where is he?
- He's not here.

58:18.270 --> 58:19.720
Better not fuckin' lie to me.

58:19.810 --> 58:21.770
Argh.
- Where the fuck is he?

58:21.850 --> 58:23.560
Where is he?
- OK, OK.

58:23.650 --> 58:25.600
Where is he?
- He play cards at Armando's.

58:25.690 --> 58:26.770
Armando's?
- Uh-huh.

58:26.860 --> 58:28.600
He's at Armando's. Yeah.

58:28.690 --> 58:31.480
Get the hell out of the way. Just stay right there.

58:34.620 --> 58:36.570
What's your name?

58:36.660 --> 58:38.200
What's your name?

58:38.290 --> 58:40.330
Conchita.
- Conchita.

58:40.420 --> 58:43.580
Now you listen to me, Conchita.
You listen to me real good.

58:43.670 --> 58:45.210
I don't wanna hurt Manny.
- OK.

58:45.300 --> 58:48.250
I don't wanna hurt him,
but he has something that belongs to me.

58:48.340 --> 58:50.830
A gun. Do you know anything about a gun?
- No, no.

58:50.930 --> 58:53.470
It's block 5, number 602. That's where he is.

58:54.140 --> 58:55.970
OK. Now listen to me.

58:56.060 --> 58:58.760
We are now on what we call the honour system.
You comprende?

58:58.850 --> 59:00.310
You understand?
- Si, seÃ±or.

59:00.400 --> 59:02.110
OK. You don't call Manny.

59:02.190 --> 59:03.690
You don't tell Manny I'm coming.

59:03.780 --> 59:07.060
You don't warn him for anything,
cos if you do, I'm gonna come back here.

59:16.460 --> 59:18.500
I can be an asshole.

59:20.750 --> 59:22.790
You made your point.

59:24.260 --> 59:26.090
You showed some balls.

59:30.680 --> 59:32.720
I like that

59:33.980 --> 59:36.020
But now it's time to be smart.

59:38.690 --> 59:41.180
You tell me... what I want to know.

59:42.990 --> 59:44.610
And I'm gonna reward you.

59:45.830 --> 59:47.860
Razors season tickets...

59:51.620 --> 59:53.780
I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

59:55.210 --> 59:57.500
I told you, we're cool.

59:57.590 --> 1:00:00.080
Just tell me.
- I'm sorry I missed.

1:00:02.180 --> 1:00:04.630
You little shit.

1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:09.600
Tell me where the fucking gun is.

1:00:10.730 --> 1:00:12.940
You tell me or I will fucking kill you.

1:00:19.410 --> 1:00:20.650
Oleg.

1:00:28.460 --> 1:00:29.210
Oleg.

1:00:32.170 --> 1:00:34.000
Oleg.

1:00:39.310 --> 1:00:41.340
Where are you, you little shit?

1:00:46.100 --> 1:00:47.930
Oleg.

1:00:48.940 --> 1:00:50.980
I'll find you.

1:00:57.660 --> 1:00:59.700
I'm gonna kill you.

1:00:59.790 --> 1:01:02.110
You're only making it worse on yourself.

1:01:03.330 --> 1:01:05.370
You hear me?

1:01:14.140 --> 1:01:16.510
Edele, I think we've picked up a stray.

1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:20.640
Indeed.

1:01:20.730 --> 1:01:21.890
Well, hello there.

1:01:21.980 --> 1:01:24.020
Hi
- And who might you be?

1:01:26.530 --> 1:01:30.310
I think we should get another ice cream cone.
- I think you're right, papa bear.

1:01:42.420 --> 1:01:44.290
Hey. Hey.

1:01:44.380 --> 1:01:46.010
You Manny?
- Manny, no.

1:01:46.090 --> 1:01:47.830
He's upstairs. What you want with him?

1:01:47.930 --> 1:01:49.420
Business.

1:01:49.510 --> 1:01:51.800
If he owes you any money, forget about it.

1:01:51.890 --> 1:01:53.850
Ha. I just cleaned the cabron out.

1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:57.890
Yeah? Who is it?

1:02:06.070 --> 1:02:07.730
Heads down on the fucking table.

1:02:07.830 --> 1:02:11.490
Heads down and hands behind your head.
You move and I will fuck you up.

1:02:11.580 --> 1:02:13.660
I will fuck you up. Don't you move.

1:02:13.750 --> 1:02:16.290
Don't you fucking move. Get the fuck down.

1:02:16.380 --> 1:02:19.050
Which one of you is fucking Manny?
Who's Manny?

1:02:19.130 --> 1:02:21.170
Manny's not here...

1:02:22.630 --> 1:02:24.630
Motherfucking pendejo.
- Are you Manny?

1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:28.140
You know what the fuck I want.
You called me pendejo, you fuck.

1:02:28.220 --> 1:02:30.890
I want my fucking gun.
I want my fucking snub nose...

1:02:30.980 --> 1:02:33.020
that you lifted from the fucking Arlington.

1:02:33.100 --> 1:02:35.680
Now, where the fuck is it? Where the fuck is it?

1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:40.060
Argh.

1:02:40.150 --> 1:02:42.440
Fuck you. Where the fuck is my gun?

1:02:47.870 --> 1:02:49.910
Your tool left a while ago

1:03:02.230 --> 1:03:05.100
Fuck. Fuck.

1:03:05.190 --> 1:03:06.850
Motherfucker.

1:03:08.990 --> 1:03:11.150
Look at that
- That's a good smile...

1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:13.820
Look at those braces
- There's a little dimple there

1:03:13.910 --> 1:03:15.950
Yeah

1:03:18.290 --> 1:03:20.170
Yeah, that's super cute.

1:03:20.260 --> 1:03:23.040
Isn't this cool, huh?
Yeah, come on. Look back in the camera.

1:03:23.130 --> 1:03:25.890
Try it again. Now you push that. Look in there.

1:03:25.970 --> 1:03:28.090
Oh, my gosh, yeah. You can see, right?

1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:32.310
It's very smart.
- Hey, Eric. You wanna hug your sister?

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:34.930
Yeah. Come on, please.
- Just a little bit.

1:03:35.030 --> 1:03:37.650
Get a little closer.
- Come on. You guys love each other.

1:03:37.740 --> 1:03:39.480
Get a little closer.
- You need a hug.

1:03:39.570 --> 1:03:41.030
A little closer
- Come on.

1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:43.410
Extend the arm

1:03:43.490 --> 1:03:46.120
Come on Come on Eric

1:03:46.210 --> 1:03:49.870
You can do it a little better than that
I mean that's your sister right?

1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:53.080
Very good
- You love your sister don't you?

1:03:53.170 --> 1:03:56.710
What about you, Oleg?
You wanna be in the film as well, don't you?

1:03:56.800 --> 1:03:59.180
My stomach hurts. Can I go to the bathroom?

1:03:59.270 --> 1:04:01.310
Sure.

1:04:03.150 --> 1:04:05.190
I'll just hold onto this.
- Mm-hm.

1:04:05.270 --> 1:04:06.600
Go outside.

1:04:06.690 --> 1:04:08.730
You take a right and then a left.

1:04:09.610 --> 1:04:12.190
Hurry up, though. You're missing out.
- Mm.

1:04:14.700 --> 1:04:17.570
Who wants to play dress up?
- Oh, good, dress up.

1:04:17.660 --> 1:04:19.990
We have... the Burning Falcon.

1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:21.410
And the Volt.

1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:36.930
There you are.
I thought you needed to go to the bathroom.

1:05:39.110 --> 1:05:41.390
I couldn't find it.

1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:43.110
Silly boy.

1:05:43.190 --> 1:05:44.610
I told you to take a right.

1:05:45.530 --> 1:05:47.860
Then a left.

1:05:49.910 --> 1:05:52.660
Come. I'll show you.

1:05:58.300 --> 1:06:01.170
Don't forget to wash your hands
when you're done.

1:06:16.570 --> 1:06:18.150
Joe?

1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:21.610
Mrs Gazelle?
- Who is this?

1:06:21.700 --> 1:06:23.410
Is this?
- Oleg.

1:06:23.500 --> 1:06:25.240
I'm sorry about taking the gun.

1:06:25.330 --> 1:06:28.870
Oleg, where are you?
- I think I'm in trouble

1:06:28.960 --> 1:06:31.580
Sweetheart I know what happened OK?

1:06:31.670 --> 1:06:35.420
Ineed you to be straight up with me.
Are the police listening in on this call?

1:06:35.510 --> 1:06:36.920
No I'm not with the police

1:06:37.020 --> 1:06:39.340
I'm at Dez and Edele's apartment.

1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:42.220
There's two other kids here.
- What?

1:06:42.310 --> 1:06:44.690
I thi... I think they're gonna hurt us.
- What?

1:06:44.780 --> 1:06:46.060
Oh Jesus

1:06:46.150 --> 1:06:48.310
Come on, come on. Is this some kind of a joke?

1:06:48.410 --> 1:06:51.410
Oleg, you have caused enough trouble today.

1:06:51.490 --> 1:06:53.030
Where are you?
- I don't know

1:06:53.120 --> 1:06:54.490
I was in the back of a van

1:06:54.580 --> 1:06:57.580
They brought us here.
This room with all these toys.

1:06:57.670 --> 1:06:59.080
They're making a video.

1:06:59.170 --> 1:07:03.330
OK. OK, Oleg. I need you to look around
for an address for me, OK?

1:07:04.090 --> 1:07:05.920
Um... is there any mail laying around?

1:07:06.010 --> 1:07:08.720
I'm in the bathroom.
She's gonna come back any minute.

1:07:08.810 --> 1:07:10.180
Bathroom, Jesus.

1:07:10.270 --> 1:07:12.720
I don't know. I don't know.

1:07:12.810 --> 1:07:14.140
I don't know, um...

1:07:14.230 --> 1:07:17.520
Er I don't know Just just call 911

1:07:19.240 --> 1:07:22.320
No. I don't want to go back to the police.

1:07:22.410 --> 1:07:23.820
Why?

1:07:23.910 --> 1:07:26.660
They want me to say
I got the gun from Mr Gazelle.

1:07:31.630 --> 1:07:34.910
Do you need some help in there?
- I'm OK

1:07:35.010 --> 1:07:37.550
It's my stomach I'm almost done

1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:40.040
Oh, you poor thing.

1:07:41.180 --> 1:07:43.260
Well, I'm right outside.

1:07:43.350 --> 1:07:45.010
Oleg?
- I'm still here

1:07:45.100 --> 1:07:47.140
OK.

1:07:47.690 --> 1:07:49.730
OK. So look in the medicine cabinet.

1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:52.610
Do you see any... any bottles?

1:07:52.700 --> 1:07:56.200
Prescription bottles usually have the address
on the front label.

1:07:58.460 --> 1:07:59.620
Do you see anything?

1:07:59.710 --> 1:08:01.620
Just Is there anything in there?

1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:06.840
Oleg. What's happening?

1:08:11.390 --> 1:08:13.380
Oleg? It's Dez. You wanna open up, please?

1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:15.840
Oleg?

1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:22.140
OK. Oleg?

1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:23.980
Come on...

1:08:24.070 --> 1:08:25.980
Oleg. Oleg.
- Oleg?

1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:27.190
What's going on?

1:08:27.290 --> 1:08:28.610
Oleg?

1:08:28.700 --> 1:08:31.870
Just open the door.
- Mrs Gazelle, I got a bottle.

1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:33.290
So now read me the address.

1:08:33.380 --> 1:08:36.710
1456, Owens Park Lane, Hoboken.
- Oleg open the door.

1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:38.760
Oleg.

1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:40.420
Let's go. Open the door.

1:08:41.350 --> 1:08:42.040
Oleg?

1:08:42.140 --> 1:08:43.220
Come on.

1:08:43.310 --> 1:08:45.300
Oleg.

1:08:48.810 --> 1:08:51.020
Wake up. Wake up.

1:08:51.110 --> 1:08:54.390
We've gotta go get Oleg. Put your coat on.
- I thought he was in jail.

1:08:59.290 --> 1:09:01.330
Hey, Holmes.

1:09:01.830 --> 1:09:05.080
I got a busted headlight.
- Hey, Lester, my man.

1:09:05.170 --> 1:09:07.620
Ouch. Who got over on you, bro?

1:09:07.710 --> 1:09:12.540
Some puta whose forwarding address
is gonna be in ten different zip codes.

1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:14.550
All of them, dumpsters.

1:09:18.140 --> 1:09:20.180
I got you covered by tomorrow night.

1:09:22.020 --> 1:09:23.190
Hey, check this out.

1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:27.650
Is that sweet or what? Hey.
A royal flush put her in my pocket.

1:09:27.740 --> 1:09:31.190
Three hundred cold puts her in mine.
- No, man. She's a beauty.

1:09:31.290 --> 1:09:33.330
Think I'm gonna hold on to her.

1:09:35.330 --> 1:09:36.530
Five hundred.

1:09:38.210 --> 1:09:40.960
Al won't miss them. Not until Cinco de Mayo.

1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:55.640
Oh, Joe. Shit.

1:09:58.320 --> 1:10:01.320
I'm under a lot of stress tonight,
so whatever I say don't count.

1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:06.660
Do I still have to go to school tomorrow?

1:10:06.750 --> 1:10:08.790
I don't know. We'll see.

1:10:25.730 --> 1:10:27.860
Remember me?
- Who the fuck are you?

1:10:28.700 --> 1:10:31.100
You got something that belongs to me.
Snub nose .38.

1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:33.740
You scored it off of Manny in a card game.
Ineed it back.

1:10:37.790 --> 1:10:39.420
Fuck.

1:10:39.500 --> 1:10:41.740
I want my fucking gun.

1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:43.880
Who the fuck are you huh?

1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:46.760
Don't be fucking stupid.

1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:48.880
Fuck.

1:11:10.170 --> 1:11:12.790
You fuck. You fuck. Where's my fucking gun?

1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:14.870
Help me. I'm burning.

1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:17.460
Where's my gun?
You gonna tell me where my gun is now?

1:11:17.550 --> 1:11:21.800
If you don't tell me where I can find it you'll have
third-degree burns. Know what that means?

1:11:21.890 --> 1:11:24.810
No cock, asshole.
You'll have a fucking melted dick.

1:11:24.890 --> 1:11:26.690
I sold it to a pimp. Lester.
- A pimp?

1:11:26.770 --> 1:11:28.810
Shit. What you waiting on for?

1:11:28.900 --> 1:11:30.860
Where can I find him?
Where can I find him?

1:11:30.940 --> 1:11:35.190
I need to fucking know now.
- He booked a cab. Union Fleet. Ask them.

1:11:43.500 --> 1:11:45.330
Stay here. Do not move.

1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:58.890
I'm not touching it.
Get away from me. Fuck you.

1:11:58.980 --> 1:12:01.270
Ow, you little shit. Just bit me.

1:12:10.450 --> 1:12:13.330
Who the hell is that?
- I'll go see. Throw me my robe.

1:12:13.420 --> 1:12:14.880
Take the kids into the bedroom.

1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:38.240
May I help you?
- I'm looking for Oleg.

1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:41.610
Oleg. You must have the wrong address.
- No. He's a ten -year-old boy.

1:12:41.700 --> 1:12:43.950
He's pale. He never smiles.

1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:47.080
He's my neighbour's kid.
He called me from this apartment.

1:12:47.170 --> 1:12:49.410
Owens Park Lane, apartment 303.

1:12:49.510 --> 1:12:51.800
Well, he must have given you
the wrong address.

1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:54.090
Or maybe you heard wrong. There's no Oleg.

1:12:54.180 --> 1:12:56.590
He said that he was being held against his will.

1:12:56.680 --> 1:13:00.550
That's ridiculous. There's only my husband
and my two children inside.

1:13:00.650 --> 1:13:03.140
No-one else. And it's late.
- Well...

1:13:03.230 --> 1:13:05.940
I would like to take a look inside
to satisfy my curiosity.

1:13:06.030 --> 1:13:08.480
This is absurd.
Are you suggesting I kidnapped Oleg?

1:13:08.570 --> 1:13:13.200
You know what? I'm gonna call the police.
I'm gonna stand here waiting for them to arrive.

1:13:13.290 --> 1:13:15.530
When all's you gotta do is just let me in.

1:13:17.790 --> 1:13:19.170
If you must.

1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:37.400
Do you mind?
- Go right ahead.

1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:43.160
The children's room is on the right.

1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:45.070
They are asleep.

1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:47.200
Please go right in.

1:13:58.510 --> 1:14:00.920
Hello.
- Don't ask, it's too ridiculous.

1:14:01.020 --> 1:14:03.060
Sorry, I'm really embarrassed.

1:14:04.310 --> 1:14:07.480
Excuse me,
but I seriously doubt he's hiding in there.

1:14:21.290 --> 1:14:23.330
What's through here?
- Playroom.

1:14:27.340 --> 1:14:28.590
Whoa.

1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:30.800
Wow.

1:14:30.890 --> 1:14:33.100
You guys got your own little Disneyland in here.

1:14:33.180 --> 1:14:37.560
Well, it's all about the children.
And as you can see, there's no Oleg.

1:14:48.830 --> 1:14:50.820
I really hope that you find him.

1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:53.120
You hear too many stories these days.

1:14:53.210 --> 1:14:57.790
God only knows if it were our children.
- If it were your children... photographs.

1:14:57.880 --> 1:14:59.920
Excuse me.
- Photographs.

1:15:01.310 --> 1:15:03.350
No photographs.

1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:07.010
If they were your children, you would have...

1:15:07.100 --> 1:15:09.940
at least one photograph
somewhere in this apartment.

1:15:10.020 --> 1:15:13.610
This is ridiculous. We only moved
into this place. Everything's in storage.

1:15:13.700 --> 1:15:17.200
Now I really must ask you to leave. I insist.

1:15:18.410 --> 1:15:20.450
Oleg?

1:15:36.350 --> 1:15:38.390
Oh, man. This is too much.

1:15:39.730 --> 1:15:41.060
It's too much.

1:15:41.150 --> 1:15:43.770
It's like some kind of a lure.
- You're making a mistake.

1:15:43.860 --> 1:15:45.270
Tell her to leave, Dez.

1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:48.480
Ma'am, if you don't leave right now,
I'm calling the police.

1:15:48.580 --> 1:15:52.440
Call them. Call them. And mention you've got
two abducted children in the next room.

1:15:52.540 --> 1:15:56.320
Two children who don't appear
in any photographs in this house.

1:15:56.420 --> 1:15:58.880
Where is Oleg?
- How dare you suggest that we...

1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:00.460
Oh...

1:16:00.550 --> 1:16:02.590
Where's the boy?

1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:05.680
Where is he?

1:16:19.450 --> 1:16:22.290
Oh, my God. Oh...

1:16:22.370 --> 1:16:24.410
You better pray he's not dead.

1:16:31.340 --> 1:16:33.380
Back off, you sick fuck.

1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:37.760
Jesus. Oh, God, help me.

1:16:38.640 --> 1:16:40.680
Come on, come on, come on.

1:16:46.530 --> 1:16:48.440
Isaid back the fuck up.

1:16:48.530 --> 1:16:51.450
You sick, twisted, motherfucking cunt.

1:16:51.530 --> 1:16:53.160
Oh...

1:16:55.790 --> 1:16:57.450
Oh, wake up.

1:16:57.540 --> 1:17:00.210
That's right. That's right.
Breathe. You're gonna be OK.

1:17:00.300 --> 1:17:03.000
You can breathe, Oleg. I'm right here.

1:17:03.090 --> 1:17:04.920
I'm right here, just breathe.

1:17:05.010 --> 1:17:07.050
That's right

1:17:17.030 --> 1:17:18.730
Back off.

1:17:18.820 --> 1:17:21.140
Isaid back off.

1:17:21.240 --> 1:17:23.280
I will blow you away.

1:17:26.290 --> 1:17:28.450
OK. Can you get up?

1:17:28.540 --> 1:17:33.620
OK. Go to the bedroom. Get the two kids.
Bring them downstairs. Nicky's there.

1:17:33.710 --> 1:17:36.750
All right? Wait with him. OK? Move over.

1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:42.600
Get out of his way.

1:17:46.310 --> 1:17:49.930
I've got a safe in the bedroom
There's 100000 cash in there and diamonds

1:17:50.030 --> 1:17:52.570
All you gotta do is take the boy and walk away.

1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:08.380
Oh, my God. Oh...

1:18:09.590 --> 1:18:11.420
Oh, God.

1:18:12.350 --> 1:18:14.390
Oh...

1:18:15.940 --> 1:18:17.980
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:18:19.480 --> 1:18:21.520
Oh, my God.

1:18:22.570 --> 1:18:25.060
Oh, you sick fucks.

1:18:25.160 --> 1:18:26.740
You're right. We're sick.

1:18:26.830 --> 1:18:29.740
We are We're sick
This is really great This is gonna help us...

1:18:29.830 --> 1:18:31.660
Give me your phone.
- Please, yeah.

1:18:31.750 --> 1:18:33.290
What are you doing?
- She wants...

1:18:33.380 --> 1:18:34.750
Who are you calling?

1:18:40.590 --> 1:18:43.000
911 What is the nature of your emergency?

1:18:43.100 --> 1:18:47.230
I just heard shooting across the hall.
1456, Owens Park Lane.

1:18:47.310 --> 1:18:49.390
What is your name ma'am?

1:18:50.900 --> 1:18:52.230
You're not serious.

1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:00.990
OK.

1:19:11.470 --> 1:19:16.100
Hey. Hey, listen, one of your cabs
just picked up my brother at Al's Automotive.

1:19:16.180 --> 1:19:17.760
Yeah, well, listen to me.

1:19:17.850 --> 1:19:20.940
I was supposed to pick him up,
but there's been a family emergency.

1:19:21.020 --> 1:19:25.440
So, what I need you to do is I need you
to find out where the cab dropped him off at.

1:19:25.530 --> 1:19:29.190
Yeah, call me back.
My phone number's 555-7556.

1:19:33.660 --> 1:19:35.700
Hello? Yeah.

1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:39.410
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Hey, calm down.

1:19:52.860 --> 1:19:55.430
What happened to your face?
- It's nothing.

1:19:55.530 --> 1:19:57.190
I need to talk to you, Joe.
- Later.

1:19:57.280 --> 1:19:58.440
No, now.

1:19:58.530 --> 1:20:01.020
Why couldn't you have just taken the kid
and left?

1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:03.190
Why couldn't you have taken the kid and left?

1:20:03.290 --> 1:20:06.820
I have never seen evil before tonight, Joe.

1:20:06.920 --> 1:20:09.080
Real fucking evil.

1:20:09.170 --> 1:20:10.630
OK?

1:20:10.710 --> 1:20:14.710
And I know that's not what I see
when I look in your eyes.

1:20:14.800 --> 1:20:16.460
Thanks a lot, Tee.

1:20:16.550 --> 1:20:21.220
I'm trying to make a point here.
- I know what point you're trying to make.

1:20:21.310 --> 1:20:24.430
I did not marry an evil man, OK?

1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:26.650
I did not marry an evil man.

1:20:26.730 --> 1:20:29.900
Shady, sleazy,
mixed up with the wrong kind of people.

1:20:29.990 --> 1:20:32.030
But definitely not evil.

1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:35.080
I know what you're trying to say, Tee.

1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:37.150
Do you?

1:20:38.620 --> 1:20:43.000
I hope so. I have turned my back
on a lot of things since we've been married.

1:20:43.090 --> 1:20:45.660
My eyes are wide open on this one.

1:20:54.850 --> 1:20:57.100
Nicky, go home with your mom.

1:20:57.190 --> 1:20:59.230
Oleg, let's go take a ride.

1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.540
What kind of music you listen to?

1:21:15.630 --> 1:21:17.130
Huh?

1:21:17.220 --> 1:21:18.930
You listen to that techno shit?

1:21:20.180 --> 1:21:23.130
You listen to rap music? You like rap music?

1:21:23.230 --> 1:21:25.470
They don't have what I listen to on the radio.

1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:26.940
Yeah, what's that?

1:21:27.020 --> 1:21:30.640
Kvasha. It's my mother's tape from Russia.

1:21:30.740 --> 1:21:32.480
What the fuck?

1:21:32.570 --> 1:21:33.730
Kvasha?

1:21:35.830 --> 1:21:38.530
You're American, not Russian.
Why listen to that shit?

1:21:39.620 --> 1:21:43.950
My mother said I started in her belly in Russia,
so I'm Russian.

1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:47.790
You're not a Russian, you're an American,
cos you were born in the USA.

1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:49.540
You're an American. An American.

1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:51.300
Say, 'I'm an American.' You say it.

1:21:51.390 --> 1:21:54.390
Say, 'I'm an American.'
Say, 'I'm an American.'

1:21:54.470 --> 1:21:56.100
I'm an American.
- American.

1:21:56.190 --> 1:21:59.350
You were born in the fucking USA.
That makes you an American.

1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:02.310
Listen to this.

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:04.190
# SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY:
I Don't Want To Go Home

1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:07.280
He'll warm up the back seat for you
when you're ready to get laid.

1:22:07.370 --> 1:22:09.410
You mark my words...

1:22:09.490 --> 1:22:11.990
# Oh I know that it's getting late

1:22:12.750 --> 1:22:14.080
Fucking Kvasha.

1:22:14.170 --> 1:22:17.920
Christ. You put me through the ringer tonight.
You know that, don't you?

1:22:18.010 --> 1:22:20.160
# I'm in no hurry baby time can wait...

1:22:20.260 --> 1:22:22.090
Hm?
- I won't say nothing.

1:22:22.180 --> 1:22:23.760
Yeah, what'd you say to the cops?

1:22:23.850 --> 1:22:28.090
What'd you say to the cops?
- I got the gun from Stevie Monroe's locker.

1:22:28.190 --> 1:22:30.090
He doesn't go there no more.

1:22:30.190 --> 1:22:31.810
Nicky told me to say that.

1:22:31.900 --> 1:22:33.640
Nicky told you to say that?

1:22:33.730 --> 1:22:35.150
Smart kid.

1:22:35.240 --> 1:22:37.860
He's my best friend.
We're gonna play for the Razors.

1:22:37.950 --> 1:22:39.860
Yeah?

1:22:39.950 --> 1:22:40.950
Hello?

1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:43.030
Yeah, that was me.

1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:44.910
The Royal Towers? How long ago?

1:22:45.750 --> 1:22:47.080
All right, thanks.

1:22:47.170 --> 1:22:50.420
Hold on. We're gonna go reclaim
some stolen property.

1:23:13.160 --> 1:23:16.500
Don't worry about it.
We're just gonna sit tight for a while.

1:23:17.580 --> 1:23:18.860
You know...

1:23:21.710 --> 1:23:23.840
...I used to know this kid.

1:23:25.970 --> 1:23:28.540
His old man was a real fucking piece of shit.

1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:33.810
Always drunk.

1:23:33.900 --> 1:23:36.930
Always smacking him and his mom around.

1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:45.150
This kid, he takes his licks...
and waits this old fucking prick out.

1:23:47.170 --> 1:23:49.950
On the morning of his 14th birthday,

1:23:51.130 --> 1:23:54.050
he walks into his old man's room
with a baseball bat.

1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:00.510
Then he Mark McGwire's
the fucking living shit out of him.

1:24:04.270 --> 1:24:08.850
After that, the old man,
he can't even hold a spoon without shaking.

1:24:12.030 --> 1:24:14.360
He don't remember things too good either.

1:24:14.450 --> 1:24:16.490
He's neutralised.

1:24:19.500 --> 1:24:21.540
Which is a good thing.

1:24:23.250 --> 1:24:25.290
Four more years max.

1:24:25.380 --> 1:24:28.880
Maybe three if you get some size early on.
You just gotta hang in there.

1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:33.930
It's more money.

1:24:34.020 --> 1:24:35.850
It's lonely at the top

1:24:35.940 --> 1:24:38.510
Running these corporations...

1:24:39.190 --> 1:24:42.030
Get your hands off Lester's property.
That's my property.

1:24:42.110 --> 1:24:44.320
I'm sorry

1:24:44.410 --> 1:24:46.730
You stay right there Don't you move

1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:50.030
Stay just like that.

1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:51.870
What the fuck?

1:24:55.340 --> 1:24:57.550
Jesus Christ, not now.

1:25:00.010 --> 1:25:02.050
Let's get in the cab.

1:25:04.100 --> 1:25:06.800
I can hide it for you.
- No, give it to me.

1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:10.180
They're gonna think you got the .38
and frisk you.

1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:14.150
Come on. Give me the fucking gun.

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:27.210
Yo, Joe. What you got there?

1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:35.100
He's a Christmas elf.
I found him hitching a ride on Broad Street.

1:25:37.140 --> 1:25:39.180
Joey's a funny fucking guy, huh?

1:25:39.980 --> 1:25:41.470
Let me take a guess, Joey.

1:25:41.570 --> 1:25:43.720
You were just about to call us.

1:25:44.780 --> 1:25:47.150
That's pretty good. You must have telepathy.

1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:48.870
I must.

1:25:48.950 --> 1:25:50.740
Give me your piece.

1:25:51.830 --> 1:25:53.570
Think I'm fucking around?

1:25:56.170 --> 1:25:57.710
How about that, huh?

1:25:57.800 --> 1:25:59.500
Cocked and ready to go.

1:25:59.590 --> 1:26:01.750
What are you, fucking nervous, tough guy?

1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:06.640
You're gonna follow us, Joey.

1:26:08.310 --> 1:26:09.800
The kid'll ride with us

1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:28.580
Stay the fuck in the car.

1:26:37.470 --> 1:26:40.640
Yeah? Nah, nah, I'm with him right now.

1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:44.400
Are you 100 per cent?

1:26:46.230 --> 1:26:48.270
You're a fucking idiot.

1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:53.580
Nah, don't worry about it.
I'm gonna take care of this motherfucker now.

1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:02.420
Come on, what the fuck?

1:27:02.510 --> 1:27:04.130
You're gonna fucking whack me?

1:27:05.970 --> 1:27:08.840
Come on, man. I told you.
You got any doubts, I'll tell you.

1:27:08.930 --> 1:27:12.220
Shut your mouth.
Shut your fucking mouth... now.

1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:15.060
You see, my old man.

1:27:16.190 --> 1:27:18.270
He says to me, 'Nobody...

1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:20.940
...knows nobody.'

1:27:21.030 --> 1:27:23.740
Would you fucking put that piece of shit away?

1:27:23.830 --> 1:27:26.990
I fucking told you on my fucking family's...
- Fucking family?

1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:29.540
When I leave here,
I'm gonna fuck Teresa in the ass.

1:27:29.630 --> 1:27:31.870
That's how much I give a fuck about your family.

1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:34.710
On my fucking family, it ain't the fucking piece.

1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:38.250
How fucking far do we go back?
How fucking long have we known each other?

1:27:38.340 --> 1:27:40.380
Come on, what the fuck?

1:27:40.470 --> 1:27:42.840
This is bullshit.
- Like I said...

1:27:42.930 --> 1:27:46.100
'Nobody knows nobody.'

1:27:48.270 --> 1:27:49.770
You fucking take this...

1:27:51.740 --> 1:27:54.310
Not in front of the fucking kid.
- What kid?

1:27:54.410 --> 1:27:57.410
Listen, you knock this fucking gun
out of my hand one more time.

1:27:57.500 --> 1:28:00.530
I'm gonna blow your fucking brains
all over this fucking place.

1:28:00.620 --> 1:28:04.210
And I'll fuck that kid up right in front of you.
You got that, nigger?

1:28:04.300 --> 1:28:07.000
Nobody knows nobody. You got that?

1:28:12.770 --> 1:28:14.810
Shit. What the fuck?

1:28:17.020 --> 1:28:18.510
Oh, shit.

1:28:18.610 --> 1:28:20.650
You see, Pop...

1:28:20.730 --> 1:28:23.610
reached out to a friend of ours
in the department.

1:28:23.700 --> 1:28:26.370
Had him pull the paper on Rydell's recent busts.

1:28:27.450 --> 1:28:31.150
Turns out our friend Sal here
was running his own little thing on the side.

1:28:31.290 --> 1:28:32.830
Hey, Sal.

1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:34.460
How's fucking business?

1:28:34.540 --> 1:28:35.660
Huh?

1:28:36.460 --> 1:28:40.630
A few weeks back,
Sal gets bagged by Rydell and his partners.

1:28:41.430 --> 1:28:46.090
They let him walk as a situated informant.

1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:49.720
We just got confirmation ten minutes ago.

1:28:49.810 --> 1:28:52.900
Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Get the fuck up.

1:28:52.980 --> 1:28:54.980
Get the fuck up.

1:28:56.160 --> 1:28:57.440
Yeah.

1:28:57.530 --> 1:28:58.940
Yeah?

1:28:59.030 --> 1:29:00.860
Oh, he's alone?

1:29:01.620 --> 1:29:04.030
Go ahead. Give me the fucking number.

1:29:12.340 --> 1:29:14.550
Have a Mai Tai on me, guys.

1:29:16.220 --> 1:29:20.270
One Nike gym bag, 60 bucks.

1:29:34.580 --> 1:29:37.500

1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:42.460
One Nokia cellphone... 100 bucks.

1:29:47.180 --> 1:29:49.890
You have just fucked yourselves.

1:29:49.980 --> 1:29:52.050
One ounce of Semtex...

1:29:52.150 --> 1:29:53.890
500 bucks

1:29:56.440 --> 1:30:00.030
Getting rid of a dirty cop...

1:30:00.990 --> 1:30:03.320
...fucking priceless.

1:30:04.410 --> 1:30:08.740
Now... the jury's still out on you, pal.
So do me a favour.

1:30:08.830 --> 1:30:11.710
Get your ass in that car and follow me.
And hey. Hey.

1:30:12.800 --> 1:30:14.380
Don't get lost.

1:30:15.390 --> 1:30:16.630
I'm not fucking gonna.

1:31:11.170 --> 1:31:13.740
Come on down. Come on down.

1:31:21.180 --> 1:31:22.590
How you doing?

1:31:27.270 --> 1:31:29.640
So...

1:31:29.730 --> 1:31:32.270
You wanna see something really cool?

1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:33.770
Mm?

1:31:39.500 --> 1:31:41.490
It's called Jet Ice.

1:31:41.580 --> 1:31:43.710
Black light paint.

1:31:43.790 --> 1:31:46.790
You gotta do crazy shit like this to fill the seats

1:31:54.600 --> 1:31:56.310
Now, Oleg...

1:31:56.390 --> 1:31:59.560
this is very serious matter

1:32:00.360 --> 1:32:02.060
This man.

1:32:02.820 --> 1:32:06.270
He give you the gun to shoot Anzor?

1:32:06.360 --> 1:32:07.940
Bullshit

1:32:08.030 --> 1:32:10.950
He gave it to you. He told you to whack me.

1:32:11.040 --> 1:32:15.620
Stop fucking protecting him.
- You shut the fuck up.

1:32:18.590 --> 1:32:21.050
Oleg You listen to me

1:32:21.130 --> 1:32:22.710
Where did you get gun?

1:32:23.850 --> 1:32:26.800
At school. I found it in a locker.

1:32:27.640 --> 1:32:30.130
Don't you fucking touch him. Don't touch him.

1:32:30.230 --> 1:32:33.980
Touch him and I'll fucking kill you.
- You shut the fuck up.

1:32:34.070 --> 1:32:36.990

1:32:44.370 --> 1:32:47.620
I'm impressed. You know Vors.

1:32:49.800 --> 1:32:54.010
Vor v zakonye, the Brotherhood.

1:32:54.090 --> 1:32:56.130
If you were smart man,

1:32:56.220 --> 1:32:59.060
you would learn to fear this symbol.

1:32:59.140 --> 1:33:01.850
Fuck you and fuck your brotherhood Vors.

1:33:01.940 --> 1:33:04.510

1:33:06.440 --> 1:33:08.150
Gonna let him muscle me around?

1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:11.160
We're just trying to establish
some truth here, Joe.

1:33:11.240 --> 1:33:14.410
To be honest, I think the man's
got some grounds for inquiry.

1:33:14.500 --> 1:33:18.120
That's fucking bullshit. I told you,
I didn't give the kid the fucking piece.

1:33:18.210 --> 1:33:19.370
Come on, Frankie.

1:33:19.460 --> 1:33:23.380
Come on, what the fuck, Frankie?
I told you. I didn't give him the fucking piece.

1:33:23.470 --> 1:33:26.670
Don't let him hurt the kid, Anzor.
Don't you fucking hurt the kid.

1:33:27.930 --> 1:33:30.470
You fuck. You fucking motherfuckers.

1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:33.230
I'm gonna fucking kill you. Oh, shit.

1:33:34.270 --> 1:33:36.270
How's that feel Joey? Huh?

1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:39.110
Fuck you, Tommy.

1:33:39.780 --> 1:33:41.820
Don't you do this, Frankie.

1:33:41.910 --> 1:33:43.400
Don't you do it.

1:33:43.490 --> 1:33:46.610
Don't you fucking let him do this.

1:33:46.710 --> 1:33:48.750

1:33:49.250 --> 1:33:50.830
I'm not fucking lying.

1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:52.500
Fuck.

1:33:53.920 --> 1:33:56.710
Jesus tell them what they wanna know.

1:33:57.890 --> 1:34:00.920
Fuck, I told you I didn't know anything, Frankie.

1:34:01.020 --> 1:34:02.130
Fuck.

1:34:04.810 --> 1:34:06.440
A fucking human hockey puck.

1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:07.980

1:34:12.610 --> 1:34:16.030
Give Anzor the gun. Kill the kid.
- Frankie don't let him do this.

1:34:20.750 --> 1:34:22.410
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:29.170
Don't let them do this

1:34:29.260 --> 1:34:32.260
What do you want me to do?
You brought it on yourself

1:34:33.310 --> 1:34:34.800
No, don't.

1:34:34.890 --> 1:34:37.100
Don't do it. Don't.

1:34:37.190 --> 1:34:38.810
I'll fucking talk.

1:34:38.900 --> 1:34:41.740
I'll fucking tell you
whatever you wanna fucking hear.

1:34:41.820 --> 1:34:44.820
No, my friend.
First you will see that I am serious.

1:34:44.910 --> 1:34:47.910
Then afterwards, believe me, you will talk.

1:34:47.990 --> 1:34:51.000
Oh, come on. Jesus Christ, I fucking told you.

1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:56.040
I fucking told you, I'll tell you whatever
you wanna hear, you fucking motherfucker.

1:34:56.130 --> 1:34:57.840
Finish it. Do it right this time.

1:34:58.630 --> 1:35:02.800
No, Anzor. Anzor, look at me. Don't fucking do it.

1:35:02.890 --> 1:35:04.000
Shut up.

1:35:05.390 --> 1:35:07.430
Isaid finish it.

1:35:08.190 --> 1:35:09.390
He's not your blood.

1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:11.360
Don't fucking do it.

1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:14.360
If you do it, I swear to God
you better swallow a bullet.

1:35:14.450 --> 1:35:17.020
There's no way you'd be able
to live with yourself.

1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:19.410
Trust me, Anzor. Don't do it.

1:35:19.490 --> 1:35:21.570
Say something bad about the Duke.

1:35:22.420 --> 1:35:25.290
Let me hear you call him a faggot.

1:35:25.380 --> 1:35:26.620
Come on.

1:35:29.380 --> 1:35:31.790
Say it.
- No.

1:35:31.890 --> 1:35:33.430
Shoot him.

1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:03.090
What are you fucking doing?

1:36:05.180 --> 1:36:07.220
Pick up the fucking gun

1:36:07.310 --> 1:36:09.350
Pick it up

1:36:10.310 --> 1:36:12.050
You do it

1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:18.150
Gutless piece of faggot shit.

1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:20.980
Come on faggot.

1:36:21.990 --> 1:36:23.870
Isaid finish it.

1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:27.990
Pick it up and use it.

1:36:30.590 --> 1:36:33.130
Pick it up and do it.

1:36:36.010 --> 1:36:38.470
Pick it up and do it.

1:36:43.150 --> 1:36:45.770
Don't you fucking walk away from me.

1:37:05.380 --> 1:37:07.510
Get up...

1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:09.670
you fuck.

1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:18.270
Fucking bullshit.

1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:20.350
Fuck. Fuck.

1:37:20.450 --> 1:37:23.950
Fuck you, Frankie.
I ain't taking the fucking heat for you no more.

1:37:24.030 --> 1:37:26.700
It wasn't supposed to go down this way.

1:37:27.500 --> 1:37:30.780
What are you talking about?
- Czar of Brighton...

1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:33.580
Vor, whatever the fuck you are.

1:37:33.670 --> 1:37:36.590
Fucking didn't like it, did you, your nephew was...

1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:39.300
was cooking and dealing in the neighbourhood.

1:37:39.390 --> 1:37:40.970
That's what he said.

1:37:41.060 --> 1:37:43.350
He said, 'Oleg, send him a message.'

1:37:43.430 --> 1:37:45.720
Said 'Let's use the kid '

1:37:45.810 --> 1:37:46.890
Yugi

1:37:46.980 --> 1:37:51.390
Would I put our thing in jeopardy
for some two-bit fucking meth lab?

1:37:51.490 --> 1:37:53.780
Think about it, OK? That's number one.

1:37:53.860 --> 1:37:55.360
Number two.

1:37:55.450 --> 1:37:59.610
I don't even live in that fucking neighbourhood.
What do I care if it blows up?

1:37:59.710 --> 1:38:01.330
The gun.

1:38:02.420 --> 1:38:05.170
It was Tommy's. You fuck.

1:38:06.460 --> 1:38:11.130
Tommy. Tommy, don't get involved
in a goddamn jock fight. It's all bullshit.

1:38:11.220 --> 1:38:13.300
He fucking put it in my right hand.

1:38:13.390 --> 1:38:17.800
A fucking snub nose .38, stainless steel.
It was Tommy's gun.

1:38:17.900 --> 1:38:21.980
You motherfucker.
I told you to get rid of that fucking piece.

1:38:22.070 --> 1:38:24.110
Yeah, well, not to my fucking recollection.

1:38:24.200 --> 1:38:28.060
He said, 'Interest the tweaker's kid in the piece.'

1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:32.110
That's what he said.
'Interest the tweaker's kid in the piece.'

1:38:32.210 --> 1:38:33.370
Ask the kid.

1:38:34.750 --> 1:38:36.460
Ask the kid.

1:38:36.550 --> 1:38:39.080
Mr Gazelle, he gave me the gun.

1:38:40.130 --> 1:38:45.130
He said I'd get to go to the game if...
if I shot Anzor.

1:38:45.220 --> 1:38:47.050
It would make his friends happy.

1:38:47.140 --> 1:38:49.220
I'm sorry, kid.

1:38:49.310 --> 1:38:52.400
OK. OK. Fuck this bullshit.

1:38:53.150 --> 1:38:55.030
Fuck you, Joey, you fucking bastard.

1:38:55.900 --> 1:38:58.110
You're fucking dead, nigger.

1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:11.880
Oh, I'm fucking shot.
- That's some bad motherfucker.

1:39:11.970 --> 1:39:13.130
Fucking Vor.

1:39:18.180 --> 1:39:19.460
Fuck you, cocksucker.

1:39:27.570 --> 1:39:30.360
You son of a bitch.

1:39:35.620 --> 1:39:38.620
You're dying, motherfucker.

1:39:40.300 --> 1:39:42.590
Where's the fucking gun?

1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:11.370
Mr Gazelle.

1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:03.400
Fuck you.

1:41:08.410 --> 1:41:10.450
Oh...

1:41:21.260 --> 1:41:23.260
Get off him, you fuck.

1:41:23.350 --> 1:41:26.800
Do you know you got my son killed,
you fucking scumbag?

1:41:26.900 --> 1:41:28.520
Oh, Frankie.

1:41:28.610 --> 1:41:31.230
I'm glad it's you
cos there's something I've been...

1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:33.390
I've really been meaning to get off my chest.

1:41:33.490 --> 1:41:37.440
You rat cocksucker. All of this fucking time.

1:41:37.530 --> 1:41:39.360
Yeah, this whole fucking time.

1:41:39.450 --> 1:41:41.530
This whole fucking time.

1:41:41.620 --> 1:41:45.490
But we don't have your finger on the trigger,
so do me. It's one more nail in your coffin.

1:41:45.590 --> 1:41:47.750
Oh, you got all that, do you?

1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:51.040
How come it took you so long, then,
huh, tough guy? Huh?

1:41:51.140 --> 1:41:53.540
How come? So fucking long. Tell me.

1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:56.050
You had to climb into bed with Yugorsky,
didn't you?

1:41:56.140 --> 1:41:59.810
I was all but out and you had to go and mix it up
with the fucking Russians.

1:41:59.900 --> 1:42:03.270
12 years undercover
and my own wife don't even fucking know.

1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:05.850
Oh, you cocksucker. You don't have to worry.

1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:09.990
She ain't never gonna hear it
from your fucking lips anyhow.

1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:12.120
You fucking scumbag.

1:42:13.290 --> 1:42:16.790
I'll tell her all about it
while she sucks my fucking dick.

1:42:25.390 --> 1:42:28.060
Come on. Come on.

1:42:28.140 --> 1:42:30.430
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:42:34.110 --> 1:42:36.070
What are you gonna do with that little boy?

1:42:36.150 --> 1:42:38.360
You know that I had a little boy? My Tommy.

1:42:38.450 --> 1:42:40.940
At one time he was your age

1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:44.070
What are you gonna do with that, kid?
What are you gonna do?

1:42:44.160 --> 1:42:48.160
What are you gonna do with that,
you Cheerio-bred, little motherfucker.

1:43:09.910 --> 1:43:11.950
Let's go home.

1:43:46.660 --> 1:43:48.240
In position.

1:43:48.330 --> 1:43:50.870
All right. On the other side. Let's go.

1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:01.880
Jesus Christ, Joey, we got shorted out.

1:44:01.980 --> 1:44:03.520
We lost you back in Newark.

1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:05.390
You were headed for Little Odessa.

1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:07.390
Air support finally made your Mustang.

1:44:08.440 --> 1:44:10.480
I'm taking the kid home to his mom.

1:44:11.450 --> 1:44:13.490
Joey, where are you going?

1:44:13.570 --> 1:44:15.780
You're hurt. We gotta get you to a hospital.

1:44:17.870 --> 1:44:19.700
I'm going home.

1:44:33.140 --> 1:44:35.100
What are you thinking?

1:44:35.190 --> 1:44:37.060
I don't wanna go home.

1:44:37.150 --> 1:44:41.440
Well, I'm next door to you, remember,
and I'm gonna be keeping my eye on you.

1:44:48.410 --> 1:44:52.330
Why don't we get breakfast before we have to
start making with the heavy explaining?

1:44:52.420 --> 1:44:54.660
Get ourselves cleaned up a bit.

1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:22.700
Hey, listen.

1:45:22.790 --> 1:45:25.660
I'm taking Nick to the game on Friday night.

1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:28.710
Maybe we could find another ticket.

1:45:31.890 --> 1:45:34.290
If you would like to go, that is.

1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:48.730
All right, that's good.

1:45:49.830 --> 1:45:51.530
You want some more orange juice?

1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:01.500
All right.

1:46:03.180 --> 1:46:04.840
Well, er...

1:46:04.930 --> 1:46:06.970
What do you say, we get out of here?

1:46:20.570 --> 1:46:22.450
Well, lookie, lookie.

1:46:22.540 --> 1:46:24.910
If it ain't little Charlie Bronson.

1:46:27.250 --> 1:46:30.780
One thing about Lester.
He always makes good on a promise.

1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:32.210
Hey, asshole.

1:46:34.470 --> 1:46:37.970
What the fuck are you doing?

1:46:38.060 --> 1:46:40.970
You fucking piece of shit.

1:46:41.060 --> 1:46:44.590
You big fucking...
- Cocksucker.

1:46:44.690 --> 1:46:48.640
In your face, motherfucker.

1:46:54.200 --> 1:46:56.360
Say hello to my little friend.

1:46:57.500 --> 1:47:01.000
That's real fucking original.
What are you? A fucking cartoon?

1:47:01.090 --> 1:47:04.090
I'm a Mac Daddy pimp. You know that.

1:47:04.170 --> 1:47:06.500
And now I'm gonna cap your ass

1:47:06.590 --> 1:47:10.180
When I'm finished with you
I'm gonna take your little punk friend...

1:47:10.270 --> 1:47:12.720
and I'm gonna put him in my posse.

1:47:12.810 --> 1:47:15.140
And I'm gonna pimp him out
for a couple of months.

1:47:15.230 --> 1:47:18.650
And then I'm gonna take your knife
and cut him from ear to ear.

1:47:18.730 --> 1:47:21.140
Just like I should have done yesterday, you fuck.

1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:23.910
I'm sure that sounds great to you
in your pimp world.

1:47:23.990 --> 1:47:27.200
But, listen.
That's not the fucking thing you wanna do.

1:47:27.290 --> 1:47:30.160
You wanna put down that fucking gun
and walk away.

1:47:30.250 --> 1:47:33.920
Cos I swear to fucking God, I'll fucking kill you.
Stupid fucking pimp bitch.

1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:35.380
Wrong.

1:47:35.460 --> 1:47:38.500
Only one of us is walking out of here.
Guess who.

1:47:38.590 --> 1:47:40.500
Oleg, get behind me.

1:47:42.810 --> 1:47:44.680
Oleg, get behind me.

1:48:05.380 --> 1:48:06.750
Come on.

1:48:07.510 --> 1:48:10.210
Oleg talk to me Come on. Talk to me.

1:48:10.300 --> 1:48:12.090
You're gonna make it

1:48:12.180 --> 1:48:14.470
Joey please You're bleeding

1:48:15.350 --> 1:48:17.060
Fuck, fuck.

1:48:19.860 --> 1:48:21.350
Look out. Look out.

1:48:38.130 --> 1:48:41.630
Mr Gazelle. Stop the car.
We need to get some help.

1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:42.960
Tee...

1:48:43.050 --> 1:48:45.260
Please Mr Gazelle.
- Tee... I'm coming home.

1:49:02.330 --> 1:49:05.280
Mr Gazelle, please. Stop the car.
We need to get some help.

1:49:05.380 --> 1:49:08.000
I've gotta tell her.
- You're hurt.

1:49:08.090 --> 1:49:10.250
I'm gonna make it home

1:49:11.930 --> 1:49:13.420
You're bleeding.

1:49:26.530 --> 1:49:28.110
God.

1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:30.190
Oh, God.

1:49:30.950 --> 1:49:32.990
Nicky, stay back. Stay back.

1:49:37.630 --> 1:49:40.080
Oh, my God.

1:49:40.170 --> 1:49:41.660
Joey.

1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:45.040
Joey, please. Stop.

1:49:45.140 --> 1:49:47.420
Mr Gazelle, wake up.

1:49:53.230 --> 1:49:56.310
Mr Gazelle. Wake up. Come on.

1:49:57.280 --> 1:49:58.600
Stop the car. Stop the car.

1:49:58.700 --> 1:50:00.980
Please. Stop.

1:50:01.070 --> 1:50:02.070
Joe?

1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:04.280
Mr Gazelle, watch out.

1:50:06.410 --> 1:50:08.410
Joe. Joe.

1:50:11.630 --> 1:50:13.840
Oleg, wait. Wait.

1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:15.120
Oh, God.

1:50:15.220 --> 1:50:17.040
Mom. Mom.

1:50:17.140 --> 1:50:18.840
Joe.

1:50:18.930 --> 1:50:20.840
Jesus.

1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:22.930
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

1:50:23.020 --> 1:50:25.260
Nicky. Call 911.

1:50:27.270 --> 1:50:29.020
Don't do this to me, Joe.

1:50:29.110 --> 1:50:31.520
Don't fucking do this to me.
- Oh, sweetheart.

1:50:31.610 --> 1:50:33.110
I loved you.

1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:34.060
OK?

1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:35.320
Just remember.

1:50:35.410 --> 1:50:36.990
I was always the real Joey.

1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:38.870
OK? I wasn't a liar.

1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:40.910
Shut up. Shut up. Look at me.

1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:42.910
Look at me. Baby, look at me in the eye.

1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:46.500
Joey, look at me in the eyes.
I don't care, OK? It doesn't matter.

1:50:46.590 --> 1:50:48.710
I'm gonna kick your ass over it later.

1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:50.460
Stay with me, Joey. Stay. Look at me.

1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:53.090
Look at me, I'm right here.
I'm right here for you.

1:50:53.180 --> 1:50:54.890
Nicky. Nicky, come here.

1:50:54.980 --> 1:50:57.020
Nicky. Nicky.

1:50:57.110 --> 1:50:59.390
He's right here.
- They're coming.

1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:00.760
They're on their way
- OK.

1:51:01.900 --> 1:51:04.060
We're still going to the game Friday, Dad?

1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:07.280
I love you, Nick.
- It's OK.

1:51:07.370 --> 1:51:09.690
He wants to go to the game, baby.
- Yeah.

1:51:09.790 --> 1:51:11.660
We're gonna go to the game.

1:51:11.750 --> 1:51:16.160
And fucking kick their asses, right, Mom?
- They are going down big fucking time.

1:51:17.260 --> 1:51:18.750
You have a bad mouth.

1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:20.920
You have a... You have a bad mouth.

1:51:23.010 --> 1:51:25.260
It's not that bad. You'll be OK.
- Joe?

1:51:32.030 --> 1:51:33.600
I'm right here.

1:51:33.700 --> 1:51:36.190
Stay right...
- I'm right here. I'm right here.

1:51:37.240 --> 1:51:39.120
Joe?

1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:40.660
Joe?

1:51:40.750 --> 1:51:41.910
Joe?

1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:43.790
Joe? Oh, God, no, no.

1:51:47.510 --> 1:51:48.880
Oh, God, no.

1:51:48.970 --> 1:51:51.340
Oh, God, Joe.

1:51:58.020 --> 1:52:00.690
Get the kid outside.
I don't want him going in there.

1:52:59.930 --> 1:53:01.510
Luis.

1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:03.850
Hey, Luis.

1:53:08.950 --> 1:53:10.740
Hey. George?

1:53:10.820 --> 1:53:13.450
The alternator's in the car.
- All right.

1:53:18.750 --> 1:53:21.620
Don't ever ask me to bury you again, Joe.

1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:42.190
What did they put in that coffin really?
- What?

1:53:42.280 --> 1:53:44.520
What did they put in the coffin?
- In the coffin?

1:53:44.620 --> 1:53:46.530
Yeah.
- Why? Did it seem heavy?

1:53:46.620 --> 1:53:47.740
Yeah.

1:53:47.830 --> 1:53:51.250
I don't know.
I'm thinking, probably a couple of blue shirts.

1:53:51.340 --> 1:53:54.170
Must have been Lashon and McCall.

1:53:54.260 --> 1:53:56.330
Does that sound good?
- And Kaimen.

1:53:56.430 --> 1:53:58.670
You want some of this too?
- For sure, Marishka.

1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:00.390
Marishka, you want some of this too?

1:54:00.470 --> 1:54:03.560
I'll take the both of you right now.
How about that?
