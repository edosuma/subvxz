Yeah, I just --
I think...

34:33.839 --> 34:36.873
I think I shouldn't
be here anymore.
Hey. Come on.

34:36.875 --> 34:39.609
Sweetheart, you were
all about cozying up to me

34:39.611 --> 34:40.911
For a selfie yesterday.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.546
Then you came
to my party.

34:42.548 --> 34:44.614
And now suddenly
you're not interested?

34:44.616 --> 34:46.850
Uh, I was
never interested.

34:46.852 --> 34:48.385
-Mm.
-Not like that.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.386
Wow.

34:49.388 --> 34:50.387
I, uh...

34:50.389 --> 34:52.856
I must've misunderstood.

34:52.858 --> 34:56.193
See, I-I thought
you wanted to be a grown-up

34:56.195 --> 34:59.696
And have
a real, grown-up career.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.531
If this is what it takes
to have a career,

35:01.533 --> 35:03.366
Then I-I don't want one.

35:03.368 --> 35:05.268
¶¶

35:11.376 --> 35:12.476
All right, sweetheart.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.544
Here. Have a drink.
All right?

35:14.546 --> 35:16.446
There you go.
Take it.

35:16.448 --> 35:17.981
There you go.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.816
Hey.

35:19.818 --> 35:22.919
Listen, if you want
to be an artist --

35:22.921 --> 35:24.421
I mean, a real artist...

35:24.423 --> 35:25.589
Please don't.
Please don't.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.891
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

35:27.893 --> 35:31.161
Then you're gonna have to
put yourself completely into it.

35:31.163 --> 35:32.929
Come here.
Deacon: Maddie?!

35:32.931 --> 35:34.464
Maddie!
Who is that?

35:34.466 --> 35:35.465
That's my dad.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.635
Dad.
Baby.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.271
[ sobbing ]

35:41.273 --> 35:43.006
You okay?
You all right?
Yes.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.274
He do anything to you?

35:44.276 --> 35:45.809
No, please don't. Dad.
Please don't.

35:45.811 --> 35:46.610
Hey, hey.
Come on. Come on.

35:46.612 --> 35:47.744
You touch my daughter?

35:47.746 --> 35:49.246
Nothing happened.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.514
"nothing happened."

35:50.516 --> 35:52.983
What about my wife?
Anything happen there?

35:54.286 --> 35:55.652
I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:55.654 --> 35:56.520
Maddie: Dad.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.155
Yeah, you do.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.324
Now the whole world knows.

36:04.096 --> 36:05.262
Let's go, maddie.

36:05.264 --> 36:06.163
Come here.

36:06.165 --> 36:08.265
I've been looking
everywhere --

36:08.267 --> 36:09.766
Deacon, what --
maddie, what's --

36:09.768 --> 36:11.601
Where were you,
cash?!

36:11.603 --> 36:12.836
What's wrong?

36:12.838 --> 36:14.604
You said you'd protect me!

36:14.606 --> 36:15.705
But when I needed you,

36:15.707 --> 36:17.641
You were gone
with some guy, cash!

36:17.643 --> 36:18.875
No, no, no, no, no!
Yes!

36:18.877 --> 36:21.611
No! I'm sorry!
Listen to me!

36:21.613 --> 36:23.380
I got caught up in everything,
and I'm really sorry.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.282
I promise that will
never happen again.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.516
You know me.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.351
Come on!

36:28.353 --> 36:30.153
Maddie!

36:30.155 --> 36:31.855
It's your choice.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.423
Let's get
out of here.

36:35.027 --> 36:37.827
[ cheers and applause ]

36:37.829 --> 36:39.162
Can't believe
they stayed.

36:39.164 --> 36:40.864
They're grateful, son.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.533
And, uh...

36:43.535 --> 36:45.635
So am I.

36:47.005 --> 36:49.172
Look, uh, it's none
of my business,

36:49.174 --> 36:52.075
But, um...

36:52.077 --> 36:54.678
You never know
if you'll get a second chance

36:54.680 --> 36:56.413
Unless you<i> take</i> a chance.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.014
I'll see you later.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.849
Wait.
You're leaving?

36:59.851 --> 37:01.751
Yeah. I'm gonna go ahead
and fly out.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.387
I'm...Pretty sure
you got a ride back.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.056
¶¶

37:14.233 --> 37:18.168
I guess I ruined
all your hard work, huh?

37:18.170 --> 37:20.003
Not the first time.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.072
Probably won't be
the last.

37:22.074 --> 37:25.775
But...
I have never been prouder.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.944
[ cellphone ringing ]

37:27.946 --> 37:29.679
I'll see you back inside.

37:29.681 --> 37:33.216
[ ringing continues ]

37:33.218 --> 37:34.351
Juliette:<i> Hey.</i>

37:34.353 --> 37:36.186
It was right after
I served you

37:36.188 --> 37:38.088
With the divorce papers,
wasn't it?

37:38.090 --> 37:40.290
It wasn't your fault.

37:40.292 --> 37:43.960
If I had known
how bad things had gotten...

37:43.962 --> 37:45.595
<i> Please -- just stop.</i>

37:45.597 --> 37:48.965
It's time for me
to take responsibility.

37:48.967 --> 37:52.602
And if that means
losing everything...

37:52.604 --> 37:53.803
Then so be it.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.438
<i> That's not gonna happen.</i>

37:55.440 --> 37:57.974
I-I meant what I said before,
juliette.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.114
We're still here.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.319

[ sniffles ]

38:10.555 --> 38:12.389
[ crying ]

38:16.428 --> 38:17.594
Hello?

38:17.596 --> 38:20.096
I just got word that cumulus
is about to make you

38:20.098 --> 38:21.665
Their artist of the month.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.400
Your album's gonna
break into the top 100.

38:23.402 --> 38:26.903
Your career
is about to skyrocket.

38:26.905 --> 38:30.240
¶ when you're tied up ¶

38:30.242 --> 38:34.010
¶ 'cause you can't
hold back ¶

38:34.012 --> 38:37.247

38:40.919 --> 38:46.089
¶ you don't have to be
that man ¶

38:46.091 --> 38:48.091
Shame they couldn't
work things out.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.826
As good as they are
as a duo...

38:49.828 --> 38:51.428
¶ everybody tells you
where to go ¶

38:51.430 --> 38:53.763
...Some people just aren't meant
to be together.

38:55.934 --> 39:02.605
¶ everybody loves you
till they don't ¶

39:02.607 --> 39:07.844
¶ just come with me,
and you won't be alone ¶

39:09.848 --> 39:14.684
¶ let me love you home ¶

39:17.356 --> 39:19.055
Hey. It's me.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.324
Daddy!
I miss you so much.

39:21.326 --> 39:23.326
<i> Oh, I miss you, too,</i>
<i> darling.</i>

39:23.328 --> 39:25.328
Listen, um,
is your mom home?

39:25.330 --> 39:26.796
I'd like to talk to her.

39:26.798 --> 39:29.532
¶ 'cause you sleep
too much ¶

39:29.534 --> 39:33.403
Still can't believe
you walked out on the oscars.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.472
I had somewhere
more important to be.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.340
¶ ...Out of touch ¶

39:37.342 --> 39:42.579
¶ when you're runnin'
in a rut ¶

39:45.317 --> 39:49.486
¶ everybody tells you

39:49.488 --> 39:51.221
Ohh!

39:52.691 --> 39:58.528
¶ and everybody loves you
till they don't ¶

39:58.530 --> 40:03.500

40:25.123 --> 40:26.990
Looks like
they're still a duo.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.026
Yeah.

40:30.028 --> 40:33.096
But they are<i> so</i> fired.

40:39.404 --> 40:40.804
[ sniffles ]

40:40.806 --> 40:42.806
I missed you so much.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.042
I'm sorry
I just ran out.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.243
She posted a picture
at vince's,

40:47.245 --> 40:48.545
And I didn't know
how long she'd be there,

40:48.547 --> 40:50.280
And I didn't know
if you'd want --

40:52.584 --> 40:55.151
You brought her back.
Thank you.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.294
Mom, dad...

41:05.931 --> 41:07.130

41:16.274 --> 41:18.575
You did a great job
in there.

organizing all of this.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.580

Hey, listen, do you think
that we could ever...

41:29.321 --> 41:32.889
I mean, would you...Consider
giving me another...

41:36.361 --> 41:39.062
Look, I mean, you --
you're single again, right?

41:40.632 --> 41:42.065
Actually, yeah.
I am.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.042
No, no.
She hasn't landed yet.

41:53.044 --> 41:56.045
Why?
Is her category up?

41:59.684 --> 42:02.418
No, I don't think
she'll care, either.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.020
Excuse me.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.055
Are you waiting
for juliette barnes to arrive?

42:06.057 --> 42:07.657
Yeah.
Yeah, I am.

42:07.659 --> 42:09.025
Is -- is there a problem?

42:09.027 --> 42:10.193
If you could just
follow me, please.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.195
Wait. You want to tell me
what's going on?

42:13.064 --> 42:14.497
We received
