01:36.927 --> 01:38.328
This is all your fault.

01:38.361 --> 01:40.497
No.

01:41.865 --> 01:44.200
What are you doing?

01:44.233 --> 01:45.569
What are you doing?

01:45.603 --> 01:47.303
- What the f...?
- There's a good boy.

01:47.337 --> 01:50.138
No. No!

01:51.406 --> 01:52.909
What are you... What are those?

01:52.942 --> 01:54.276
What the fuck are those?

01:54.309 --> 01:55.845
No.

01:55.878 --> 01:57.513
No.

01:58.715 --> 02:01.416
You left me no choice.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.420
No, no, no, no...

02:14.428 --> 02:15.764
Fuck!

02:19.433 --> 02:21.268
No!

02:21.302 --> 02:22.571
Help me!

02:24.438 --> 02:25.674
Somebody help me!

02:25.707 --> 02:28.677
Somebody help me...

02:28.710 --> 02:29.678
Oh, God.

02:29.711 --> 02:31.312
Please don't do this.

02:31.345 --> 02:32.547
They were fucking kids.

02:32.581 --> 02:35.249
They're just fucking kids!

02:36.617 --> 02:37.952
We love you, Bobby.

02:37.985 --> 02:39.887
You're like a brother
to us, Bobby.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.188
Okay, why do I sense
there's a "but" coming here?

02:42.222 --> 02:44.892
But, this is the last time we let
you organize us accommodations.

02:44.925 --> 02:48.796
What? You don't like nature,
huh? You don't like the woods?

02:48.829 --> 02:52.500
I like electricity
and I like hot water.

02:52.533 --> 02:55.301
Didn't have to be so far out,
man. There are closer camps.

02:55.335 --> 02:57.972
Yeah, we're literally in
the middle of nowhere. dude.

02:58.005 --> 03:00.840
Okay, look, every hotel within
a 30-mile radius was booked up.

03:00.874 --> 03:02.842
I mean, everyone's in town
to watch the Hyenas

03:02.876 --> 03:04.443
demolish the Beavers tomorrow.

03:04.476 --> 03:05.812
Big game of football,
small town,

03:05.845 --> 03:08.848
plus a little impromptu reunion
with the nine of us

03:08.882 --> 03:11.918
means not a lot of options
to suit everyone's bank account.

03:11.951 --> 03:14.453
- Okay?
- Great. Thanks.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.989
Yeah, I don't know.

03:16.022 --> 03:18.692
I'm pretty sure I can afford
two rooms at the Tiki Motel.

03:18.725 --> 03:22.929
People go to the Tiki Motel to get
three things: bed bugs, crack, dead.

03:22.962 --> 03:26.498
I'd rather share the woods with these
vermin than step foot in that shithole.

03:26.532 --> 03:29.434
Okay, there's a lot of reasons
why this is more advantageous

03:29.467 --> 03:30.669
than a hotel.

03:30.703 --> 03:32.336
Who says "advantageous"?

03:32.370 --> 03:33.639
Uh, she does, bro.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.473
We can be as loud as we want.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.842
The fire's awesome.

03:36.875 --> 03:40.512
And we haven't all been together
in a while.

03:43.448 --> 03:44.750
Jesus, bro.

03:44.783 --> 03:47.251
Classic.

03:47.285 --> 03:50.487
- Still such an idiot.
- All right. All right.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.255
Laugh it up, a-holes.

03:52.289 --> 03:53.624
You don't use that shit,

03:53.658 --> 03:55.626
you're all going to end up
with Zika, Ebola,

03:55.660 --> 03:57.562
West Nile or herpes.

03:57.595 --> 04:01.566
Uh, relatively certain you can't
contract herpes from a mosquito.

04:01.599 --> 04:02.867
Yeah, you can.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.836
Katie Krewson,
my girlfriend junior year,

04:04.869 --> 04:06.436
she had it,
she gave it to me.

04:06.470 --> 04:09.507
I asked her about it,
said she got it from a mosquito.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.709
I don't think
that's how it works, dude.

04:12.743 --> 04:15.478
Wait, that's cured now, right?

04:15.512 --> 04:17.013
Yeah.

04:17.047 --> 04:19.381
Probably.

04:19.415 --> 04:21.752
Oh, gross.

04:21.785 --> 04:24.955
- Where are you going, babe?
- What, I can't take a piss in the woods?

04:24.988 --> 04:27.891
Or do I have to get
your permission for that too?

04:30.894 --> 04:33.997
Somebody put
hot sauce in her taco.

04:34.030 --> 04:36.532
- What did you do, bro?
- More like, who'd you do?

04:36.565 --> 04:39.434
You got a reputation, man.
That's all I'm saying.

04:56.384 --> 04:58.319
Chalk this one up
to too many beers,

04:58.353 --> 05:00.722
but the last person you want
to piss off is Cici, man.

05:00.755 --> 05:02.590
That chick is vindictive.

05:02.624 --> 05:05.493
You remember... What was that
history teacher's name?

05:05.527 --> 05:06.995
Mr. Edmunds.

05:07.028 --> 05:11.800
Mr. Edmunds, gave Cici detention
for texting in class one Friday.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.669
So Monday, she comes back,
posts on the NAMBLA forums

05:14.702 --> 05:16.838
- from his school P.C.
- NAMBLA?

05:16.871 --> 05:19.439
North American Man-Boy
Love Association.

05:19.473 --> 05:21.375
Ouch.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.610
Oh, poor Mr. Edmunds.

05:22.644 --> 05:23.944
Guy gets arrested,

05:23.977 --> 05:26.013
put on the sex offender
watch list.

05:26.046 --> 05:27.714
Wait, seriously?

05:27.748 --> 05:29.750
Shit, I wondered what happened
to that guy.

05:29.783 --> 05:31.018
Fucking loved me.

05:31.051 --> 05:33.554
Gave me straight A's
all the time.

05:33.587 --> 05:34.855
Shea, you're up.

05:34.888 --> 05:37.090
Yeah, we all did fucked-up shit
in high school.

05:39.458 --> 05:41.028
No one here is innocent.

05:41.061 --> 05:43.030
Well, you know what I say?
Fuck the past!

05:43.063 --> 05:44.798
- Yeah, fuck it.
- Whoo!

05:44.832 --> 05:46.700
I'm just happy
to be here right now.

05:52.939 --> 05:54.040
Boo!

05:54.073 --> 05:56.943
Amber, you scared me.

05:56.976 --> 05:59.444
Sorry.

05:59.477 --> 06:02.682
So you know I can read you
like a book, right?

06:02.715 --> 06:05.383
Okay, well, I don't read books,

06:05.417 --> 06:08.554
but I can read you
like a celebrity gossip blog.

06:08.588 --> 06:10.756
What did he do now?

06:10.790 --> 06:12.858
Want to talk?

06:14.559 --> 06:16.460
I think he's cheating on me.

06:19.564 --> 06:21.566
Okay.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.536
Well, if he is,

06:24.569 --> 06:27.572
then you need to be Amber Heard
to his Johnny Depp

06:27.606 --> 06:29.608
and leave Ezra's sorry ass.

06:29.641 --> 06:31.375
I know. I just...

06:32.544 --> 06:34.779
I kind of like making him
fight for it.

06:34.813 --> 06:36.881
Watching him squirm.

06:38.582 --> 06:40.718
You are such a bitch.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.989
No wonder we're besties.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.130
Hey, Erin.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.999
Oh, thanks.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.871
You seem quieter than usual.

07:03.472 --> 07:04.841
I'm fine.

07:06.042 --> 07:08.811
Just seeing everyone
back together...

07:10.613 --> 07:12.081
takes me back to high school.

07:13.549 --> 07:16.119
Wasn't exactly
the happiest time for me.

07:18.221 --> 07:19.889
I'm sorry.

07:21.958 --> 07:25.794
No, I... I don't want
this weekend to be about Caleb.

07:25.827 --> 07:28.130
I want it to be about
having fun.

07:29.965 --> 07:32.034
Remember when we played
Truth or Dare,

07:32.067 --> 07:34.636
and when it was her turn,
you dared her to go home.

07:34.670 --> 07:36.571
Oh, shit.

07:36.605 --> 07:38.874
I'm just glad to see
you're not acting weird

07:38.907 --> 07:41.043
around Erin anymore.

07:41.076 --> 07:43.045
High school was a long time ago.

07:49.216 --> 07:51.619
My taste in woman
has changed...

07:51.652 --> 07:52.753
...for the worse.

07:52.787 --> 07:54.555
Dick.

07:54.588 --> 07:56.123
I like a girl I can argue with,

07:56.157 --> 07:59.126
and then have explosive
makeup sex with later.

08:00.227 --> 08:04.899
Besides, Erin's been mute
ever since, you know.

08:04.932 --> 08:06.968
Well, with what
she's been through, Kato,

08:07.001 --> 08:08.970
maybe you should just
cut her some slack.

08:09.003 --> 08:11.604
I mean, she was
like that before.

08:16.076 --> 08:17.476
Need any help here, bro?

08:18.745 --> 08:21.815
No, thanks. I've seen too many
rock stars go down that road.

08:21.848 --> 08:23.550
You remember my band, right?

08:25.285 --> 08:27.520
Dick Cancer.

08:27.554 --> 08:29.756
Cock Tumor.

08:29.789 --> 08:31.291
We changed our name
after college.

08:31.324 --> 08:32.359
Our sound had matured,

08:32.392 --> 08:35.794
so it made sense that we
mature with it, you know?

08:35.828 --> 08:37.930
Go by Butthole Equinox now.

08:37.963 --> 08:40.032
Played Gato Loco last week,
Wednesday.

08:40.065 --> 08:41.300
Place was packed.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.268
It was also half-off
frozen margarita night,

08:43.302 --> 08:46.171
so it's tough to say
what the big pull was.

08:46.205 --> 08:48.207
I sent you a link on Facebook
though, didn't I?

08:48.240 --> 08:50.209
I can make sure
you're added to the list.

08:50.242 --> 08:52.778
Don't bother, bro.
I blocked you.

08:55.581 --> 08:57.082
Ow. Fuck.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.851
To old times?

09:02.286 --> 09:03.654
Yeah.

09:03.688 --> 09:05.523
Cheers.

09:08.026 --> 09:10.661
I did not think you'd come.

09:10.695 --> 09:15.099
I mean, this isn't exactly
your kind of jam, roughing it.

09:17.735 --> 09:19.704
Falling asleep
under the stars.

09:19.737 --> 09:21.305
Oh, fuck the stars.

09:21.339 --> 09:23.907
You should see the fairy lights
in my tent.

09:38.622 --> 09:40.690
Normally I'm a "bros before hos"
kind of guy,

09:40.724 --> 09:43.226
but this one time I got to cross
the party line and ask,

09:43.260 --> 09:45.896
what the hell
do you see in that guy?

09:45.929 --> 09:49.231
I mean, dead-end rock band.

09:49.265 --> 09:50.266
Dopey smile.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.134
You know, you were
valedictorian.

09:52.168 --> 09:54.270
Now you're graduating
from M.I.T.

09:54.303 --> 09:58.974
I ain't no genius,
but that shit don't compute.

10:01.343 --> 10:04.580
Weren't you, like,
a huge drug dealer in college?

10:05.781 --> 10:07.383
I grew out of it.

10:07.416 --> 10:11.187
I had the good sense to identify
a bad habit and drop it.

10:15.090 --> 10:16.958
I need a refill.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.893
Your drink's almost full.

10:20.061 --> 10:22.730
No, it's not. Dickhead.

10:26.201 --> 10:28.203
♪ I'm feeling lonely ♪

10:28.236 --> 10:29.938
Something you want to say?

10:31.272 --> 10:32.740
Good night, Oregon!

10:32.774 --> 10:35.009
Hey, when are you opening
for Coldplay?

10:35.043 --> 10:36.877
Fuck this.

10:45.919 --> 10:47.721
Jesus.

10:47.754 --> 10:50.991
Can't tell if they're fucking
or performing an exorcism.

10:53.127 --> 10:55.062
No, I'm going to blow.
I'm going to blow.

10:55.095 --> 10:56.930
Almost there, Bobby.

10:56.964 --> 10:58.365
Almost there.

10:59.899 --> 11:01.033
What the fuck, Bobby?

11:01.067 --> 11:02.201
Come on, Cici.

11:02.235 --> 11:05.104
I told you,
nothing happened.

11:05.138 --> 11:07.373
Trust me, okay?

11:09.242 --> 11:10.843
What's the point of us
being out here

11:10.877 --> 11:13.146
if you're going to treat me
this way, huh?

11:21.154 --> 11:23.222
Fine. Fuck. Whatever.

11:26.791 --> 11:30.095
All right, rock star, are you
ready for something different?

11:30.128 --> 11:33.098
- Those real?
- They're my dad's.

11:33.131 --> 11:34.733
That is disgusting.
That is gross.

11:34.766 --> 11:37.035
Oh, no. They're my dad's
department-issued cuffs.

11:37.068 --> 11:38.403
- Oh.
- So they're legit.

11:38.436 --> 11:41.006
Let's get kinky.

11:44.510 --> 11:46.244
Ow, ow, ow ow.
Got caught on my skin.

11:46.278 --> 11:48.045
Oh, I am sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:48.078 --> 11:50.214
- Oh, ow.
- I'm sorry.

11:50.247 --> 11:51.715
I was trying to be cool.

11:51.749 --> 11:53.317
How many times
do I have to tell you,

11:53.350 --> 11:56.187
I'm the cool one
in this relationship.

11:56.220 --> 11:58.189
I'm the rock star.
You're the smart one.

11:58.222 --> 12:00.492
Never forget that.

12:00.525 --> 12:02.293
Now get over here.

12:05.462 --> 12:06.997
What?

12:07.031 --> 12:08.866
Nothing.

12:08.899 --> 12:10.768
Come on, say it.

12:10.801 --> 12:12.802
You seem really happy.

12:12.835 --> 12:14.437
I'm just really excited
for tomorrow.

12:14.471 --> 12:16.773
Since when do you care
about football?

12:16.806 --> 12:19.742
So how about by the time
we're 35, we get married.

12:19.776 --> 12:21.277
What?

12:21.311 --> 12:24.814
Um, let's... Let's make it 40,
okay?

12:24.847 --> 12:26.115
Done deal.

12:26.149 --> 12:29.919
Hey, good work tonight.

12:29.953 --> 12:32.889
Jesus, I... I got to go.
Hold on.

12:32.922 --> 12:34.491
I'm fucking starving.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.175
Fuck. Oh, shit.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.226
Turn the fuck around, Erin.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.927
Don't look at me.
Get down!

13:48.961 --> 13:51.163
Don't you fucking look at me.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.465
Are you alone?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.434
- Speak up.
- Yes.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.303
Is everyone sleeping, hmm?

13:57.336 --> 13:58.837
I think so.

13:58.871 --> 14:00.039
Has anybody seen me?

14:00.072 --> 14:01.541
No.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.275
Okay, good.

14:03.309 --> 14:04.577
That's good.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.178
Okay.

14:06.211 --> 14:07.980
Turn around.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.282
Please, let me go.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.317
I haven't seen your face.

14:13.552 --> 14:15.887
Shut your eyes.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.221
You don't have to do this.
Please.

14:17.255 --> 14:19.190
Close your eyes.

14:20.158 --> 14:21.893
- Please.
- I'm so sorry.

14:49.052 --> 14:50.954
Rian. Rian, wake up.

14:52.155 --> 14:53.924
Rian.

14:53.957 --> 14:55.626
What's going on?

14:55.660 --> 14:57.260
I don't know.

15:01.364 --> 15:03.933
We were gassed.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.337
What the hell are these?

15:08.371 --> 15:10.306
I have no fucking idea.

15:11.340 --> 15:12.609
Babe?

15:14.377 --> 15:15.645
Kato, are you...?

15:15.679 --> 15:17.413
Oh, my fucking God!

15:17.446 --> 15:20.049
What's going on here?

15:20.082 --> 15:21.685
Our cars.

15:21.718 --> 15:23.218
They're gone.

15:25.387 --> 15:28.056
Just... Just calm down.

15:34.396 --> 15:36.499
He won't wake up! Bobby!

15:36.532 --> 15:39.100
Where the fuck are you?

15:39.134 --> 15:40.603
Shut the fuck up.

15:41.436 --> 15:43.304
What the fuck is going on?

15:43.338 --> 15:46.274
Jesus, you're all so annoying.

15:46.307 --> 15:48.710
Mr. Peterson?

15:48.743 --> 15:50.512
Rian.

15:50.545 --> 15:52.680
It's so good to see you again,

15:52.714 --> 15:56.049
though I do wish it was under
better circumstances.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.720
- My head hurts.
- That's from the halothane.

15:58.753 --> 16:00.120
What is that?

16:00.154 --> 16:01.556
- Sleeping gas.
- Fuck.

16:01.589 --> 16:04.492
It's been a long time
since I taught all of you.

16:05.527 --> 16:08.028
Tonight's your final lesson.

16:08.061 --> 16:10.297
- This isn't funny!
- Don't. Don't.

16:10.330 --> 16:11.732
It's not supposed
to be funny.

16:11.765 --> 16:14.100
Where the fuck is Bobby,
you fucking weirdo?

16:14.133 --> 16:16.470
- Cut this shit off.
- Don't you worry about Bobby.

16:16.503 --> 16:18.971
You'll hear from him
soon enough.

16:20.239 --> 16:21.675
Paul...

16:21.708 --> 16:23.710
that's not coming off,
trust me.

16:23.744 --> 16:27.013
That's industrial-grade cabling.
Save your energy.

16:27.046 --> 16:28.981
You're going to need it
for later.

16:29.015 --> 16:31.451
What the fuck is going on?

16:31.485 --> 16:33.520
Get back! Get the fuck back!

16:33.554 --> 16:35.987
All right!

16:36.021 --> 16:37.757
All right,
just put it down.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.090
We can talk, man.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.293
Whatever's going on,
we can talk.

16:41.326 --> 16:43.028
Please, man.

16:49.034 --> 16:51.303
You've all gone on
with your lives.

16:51.336 --> 16:54.172
Moved on as if nothing
ever happened.

16:56.074 --> 16:57.643
Reckless?

16:57.677 --> 16:59.009
Yes.

17:00.679 --> 17:02.012
Entitled?

17:02.046 --> 17:03.414
Most definitely.

17:03.447 --> 17:04.716
Desensitized.

17:04.749 --> 17:07.686
That's what all of you are.

17:07.719 --> 17:09.488
Erin...

17:10.755 --> 17:13.390
...I'm so sorry
to drag you into this.

17:15.494 --> 17:18.062
You were always
such a sweet girl.

17:20.097 --> 17:22.501
But I can't leave
anyone out of this.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.069
Is this about Caleb?

17:30.106 --> 17:31.509
No.

17:33.309 --> 17:35.078
This is about all of you.

17:35.111 --> 17:37.715
We all graduated high school,
man.

17:37.748 --> 17:40.450
We don't need your science class
problem-solving bullshit.

17:40.484 --> 17:42.452
What the hell is this about?

17:42.486 --> 17:46.389
Tonight, you're going
to find out

17:46.422 --> 17:49.759
just how good of friends
you really are.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.761
- What is that?
- What is that?

17:51.794 --> 17:54.129
What the fuck?

17:54.162 --> 17:55.732
What the fuck is this?

18:02.271 --> 18:04.541
Is this like, laser tag?

18:04.574 --> 18:07.510
I watched my son die.

18:07.544 --> 18:12.648
And I watched my wife
dose herself into suicide.

18:13.549 --> 18:14.683
He's crazy.

18:14.716 --> 18:17.251
Time with my family was...

18:17.285 --> 18:19.120
Was taken from me.

18:19.153 --> 18:20.522
Time.

18:22.558 --> 18:24.258
Only once it's been stolen
from you

18:24.292 --> 18:30.164
can you truly appreciate what a
precious resource it really is.

18:32.366 --> 18:33.802
So precious, in fact,

18:33.835 --> 18:39.507
that only one of you will
leave these woods alive tonight.

18:40.841 --> 18:43.176
- The one...
- What the fuck?

18:43.209 --> 18:44.512
...with the most time.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.852
What the fuck?

18:54.722 --> 18:56.122
No!

18:57.190 --> 18:58.291
What the fuck?

19:01.861 --> 19:02.929
Holy shit!

19:02.963 --> 19:05.599
Oh! Fucking hard core!

19:05.632 --> 19:07.299
Rian, what are you doing?
Get back.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.469
You're going to get brains
all over yourself.

19:09.502 --> 19:11.270
See this?

19:11.303 --> 19:14.139
This is why I was never allowed
to sleep over at Caleb's house.

19:14.173 --> 19:15.542
Why would he do that?

19:15.575 --> 19:17.176
Why would he do that
in front of us?

19:17.209 --> 19:18.678
He was always fucking weird.

19:18.712 --> 19:20.847
- Just like his kid.
- Found our phones.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.782
So call the fucking cops,
brainiac.

19:22.816 --> 19:24.315
Good luck with that.

19:24.349 --> 19:26.919
Fuck, the one time
I don't get insurance.

19:26.952 --> 19:29.320
Guys...

19:29.354 --> 19:30.489
they're timers.

19:36.662 --> 19:38.464
And they're set.

19:38.497 --> 19:39.698
This sucks.

19:39.732 --> 19:41.467
I don't like this.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.835
Now I know I had
too much to drink,

19:42.868 --> 19:44.603
because I'm in
the middle of a dream

19:44.637 --> 19:46.204
where my high school
science teacher

19:46.237 --> 19:47.839
stitched my ass
into a metal vest,

19:47.872 --> 19:50.608
downloaded all the "Saw" movies,

19:50.642 --> 19:52.677
bitched about millennials
for a hot second,

19:52.710 --> 19:55.312
then blew his fucking
brains out.

19:55.345 --> 19:56.848
Well, look, they're green.

19:56.881 --> 19:59.517
Green's a positive,
happy color, right?

20:00.918 --> 20:02.654
Hey, Shea's got a blue one.

20:02.687 --> 20:04.622
I want a blue one.

20:04.656 --> 20:06.189
Because she's got
the most time.

20:06.223 --> 20:07.625
What the fuck does
that mean, Miss M.I.T.?

20:07.659 --> 20:09.894
- We can figure this out.
- Will we, Erin?

20:09.927 --> 20:12.929
What do you think happens
when that timer hits zero, Erin?

20:12.963 --> 20:14.831
Generally speaking,

20:14.865 --> 20:17.266
unless I'm fucking
watching a rocket launch

20:17.299 --> 20:19.536
or heating up a burrito
in a fucking microwave,

20:19.569 --> 20:22.739
countdown timers
are a bad fucking thing!

20:22.773 --> 20:24.508
Get this thing off of me.

20:24.541 --> 20:25.776
Peterson said
it was pointless.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.343
I don't care,
just get it off.

20:27.376 --> 20:29.546
Okay. Um...

20:32.314 --> 20:34.518
I think I know a way how,

20:34.551 --> 20:38.353
but I'd have to chop off your
arms and your head to do it.

20:38.386 --> 20:40.923
- Shut up, PJ.
- No, he's fucking right.

20:40.956 --> 20:42.625
These things are airtight.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.827
Where the fuck is Bobby?

20:44.860 --> 20:46.762
The last thing we need is Bobby.

20:46.796 --> 20:48.998
And why the fuck not,
Miss Know-It-All?

20:49.031 --> 20:50.566
Bobby sold us out.

20:50.599 --> 20:52.568
He worked with Peterson
to get us here.

20:52.601 --> 20:54.335
No.

20:54.369 --> 20:55.771
Think about it, Shea.

20:55.805 --> 20:57.973
How does one man transport
all of our cars

20:58.007 --> 20:59.908
out of the woods alone,
gas us all?

20:59.941 --> 21:03.410
- He doesn't. Bobby helped him!
- No, Bobby would never do that.

21:03.444 --> 21:05.412
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fucking sure.

21:05.446 --> 21:08.583
It was mysteriously Bobby's idea
to come here in the first place.

21:10.284 --> 21:14.556
Bobby knew a place
we could stay for free.

21:14.589 --> 21:16.624
Bobby and Mr. Peterson
made a deal

21:16.658 --> 21:18.793
to trap us out here
for whatever crazy,

21:18.827 --> 21:20.895
messed-up game this is.

21:20.929 --> 21:22.597
Where is he?

21:22.630 --> 21:24.598
We don't need Bobby.

21:24.631 --> 21:25.999
What we need is a car!

21:26.033 --> 21:29.335
Fuck. Okay.
Okay, all right.

21:29.368 --> 21:33.741
Mr. Peterson didn't drive
the last car out of here

21:33.774 --> 21:35.008
and then walk back.

21:35.042 --> 21:37.778
There has to be a car around
here somewhere.

21:37.811 --> 21:40.748
We need to find it
and get back to civilization.

21:40.781 --> 21:42.649
All right,
let's fucking move then.

21:42.683 --> 21:43.851
Go. Go. Go!

21:43.884 --> 21:45.853
Come, PJ.

21:45.886 --> 21:47.920
Let's go up this way.

21:47.954 --> 21:49.856
Amber, pass the flashlight.

21:50.823 --> 21:53.893
Yo, Cici? Let's check back here.

21:53.926 --> 21:56.496
I think I'm going
to go with my friends.

21:56.529 --> 21:57.797
Let's go, Kato.

21:57.830 --> 21:59.499
Just yell if you see anything!

21:59.532 --> 22:00.933
No shit, Sherlock.

22:00.967 --> 22:02.969
This is the worst reunion ever!

22:03.002 --> 22:04.302
Shit.

22:05.671 --> 22:07.039
Something's not right.

22:07.073 --> 22:09.008
The longer we wait,
the worse it's gonna get.

22:11.375 --> 22:13.044
Has anyone seen anything?

22:14.546 --> 22:16.448
They've got to be close, guys.

22:16.481 --> 22:17.649
Shea, come on.

22:22.954 --> 22:24.288
Oh.

22:29.795 --> 22:31.763
Oh, fucking come on.

22:38.936 --> 22:40.805
There's nothing here.

22:40.838 --> 22:42.606
Why would Peterson do this?

22:42.640 --> 22:43.974
We all know why he's doing it.

22:44.008 --> 22:46.510
Just don't exactly know
what he's done.

22:52.883 --> 22:54.985
There's fuck-all out here!

23:09.465 --> 23:11.034
Bobby?

23:11.067 --> 23:12.769
Guys!

23:12.802 --> 23:14.838
Hey, guys, come here!

23:14.871 --> 23:16.506
Over here!

23:21.477 --> 23:22.978
This way! Guys, come quick!

23:23.011 --> 23:24.847
We better get
some fucking answers.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.014
Shea, come on.

23:26.048 --> 23:28.517
Amber, hurry up.

23:30.085 --> 23:32.754
Kato, wait.

23:34.156 --> 23:37.593
- We're here!
- My God, Bobby, are you okay?

23:37.626 --> 23:39.728
Get the fucking crowbar!
Break this fucking lock.

23:39.761 --> 23:42.430
Why is there a fucking
crowbar there, Bobby?

23:42.464 --> 23:45.033
Please, just hurry, okay?
Jesus!

23:45.067 --> 23:47.602
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to get Bobby out.

23:47.635 --> 23:48.936
What the fuck, Shea?

23:48.970 --> 23:51.105
Bobby's obviously
working with Peterson.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.774
He helped get us here.
Why would you let him out?

23:53.808 --> 23:55.142
We just found him
chained to a tree

23:55.176 --> 23:57.011
with the shit
kicked out of him, Rian.

23:57.044 --> 23:59.747
That doesn't exactly
scream "accomplice" to me.

23:59.780 --> 24:00.882
Help, please!

24:00.915 --> 24:02.617
You're being crazy, Shea.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.951
You need to think.

24:03.985 --> 24:06.120
It's a very basic situation.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.155
Bobby is not on our side.

24:09.590 --> 24:10.957
Fuck!

24:10.991 --> 24:13.760
Okay. Okay.
He made me do it!

24:13.793 --> 24:15.195
He made me do it.

24:15.228 --> 24:17.429
Just please, just-just-just
get me out of this

24:17.464 --> 24:18.899
and I'll explain everything,
okay?

24:18.932 --> 24:21.433
How exactly does someone
make another person

24:21.468 --> 24:23.803
drag eight of their friends
out into the woods

24:23.837 --> 24:25.906
to watch his suicide?

24:25.939 --> 24:27.908
Like I said,
if I were to posit...

24:27.941 --> 24:30.043
Posit? Fucking posit?

24:30.076 --> 24:32.078
Words like that are why people
fucking hate you.

24:32.112 --> 24:34.080
- People hate me?
- Yeah. I fucking hate you.

24:34.114 --> 24:35.514
Yeah, go do algebra somewhere.

24:35.547 --> 24:37.049
Whoa, let's take it easy, guys.

24:37.082 --> 24:38.484
Shut the fuck up.

24:38.517 --> 24:41.921
He was willingly helping
Mr. Peterson.

24:41.954 --> 24:44.456
There is no other
feasible explanation.

24:44.490 --> 24:46.892
So we just leave him
chained to a fucking tree?

24:46.926 --> 24:48.961
Um... I'm gay.

24:48.994 --> 24:50.129
- Are you serious?
- What?

24:50.162 --> 24:52.464
Okay? I'm... I'm gay...

24:52.498 --> 24:54.500
every now and again.

24:54.533 --> 24:57.670
What do you mean, "You're gay
every now and then," Bobby?

24:57.703 --> 24:59.070
Like, part-time gay?

24:59.103 --> 25:01.606
I'm bi. I'm bisexual.

25:01.639 --> 25:03.508
Thank God I didn't share
a fucking tent with him.

25:03.541 --> 25:05.977
- Fuck you, Ezra!
- No, fuck you, Bobby!

25:06.010 --> 25:07.512
Fuck you, man!

25:07.545 --> 25:10.081
- No fucking thank you!
- Peterson knew!

25:10.114 --> 25:12.183
I confided in him
in high school.

25:12.216 --> 25:15.820
And now that sick fuck took
photos of me at some club

25:15.853 --> 25:17.522
one month ago, and he...

25:17.555 --> 25:19.123
He threatened to release
the pictures.

25:19.157 --> 25:20.525
It would ruin my life.

25:20.558 --> 25:22.592
Unless I dragged
all you guys out here.

25:22.626 --> 25:25.862
Okay? And I did not know that
anything fucked up was going on

25:25.896 --> 25:27.497
until he showed up with a gun.

25:27.531 --> 25:30.634
He said that he wanted closure
for Caleb's death.

25:30.667 --> 25:33.704
He wanted to reminisce about
old memories, or some bullshit.

25:33.737 --> 25:36.273
He knocked me out
while he was gassing our tents.

25:36.306 --> 25:38.241
He's the one who beat
the shit out of me, okay?

25:38.275 --> 25:40.811
- What a fucking homophobe.
- Seriously, Kato?

25:40.844 --> 25:42.112
My job is everything to me.

25:42.145 --> 25:44.147
Okay? Like, the only reason

25:44.181 --> 25:47.049
I'm doing so well at work
is because my boss,

25:47.083 --> 25:49.085
Mrs. Rowe, she wants
to fuck me, okay?

25:49.118 --> 25:52.054
- Gross, dude.
- She's not gonna want to fuck me now, so here we are.

25:52.088 --> 25:55.658
And I'm sorry, but I didn't know
anyone was going to get hurt.

25:55.691 --> 25:57.626
What happens when these timers
hit zero, huh?

25:57.660 --> 25:59.996
- Just take it easy.
- What do you mean, "get hurt?"

26:00.029 --> 26:01.731
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on.

26:01.764 --> 26:03.099
He didn't tell you the rules?

26:03.132 --> 26:04.734
What rules, Bobby?

26:04.767 --> 26:06.068
Let's just take it down, okay?

26:06.102 --> 26:08.738
Just let me out
and I'll explain everything.

26:08.771 --> 26:11.706
It's really simple, actually.

26:11.740 --> 26:14.109
Come on, baby, yeah.
Come on, please, please, please.

26:14.142 --> 26:16.011
- What the fuck?
- Come on, guys.

26:16.044 --> 26:17.812
What are we supposed
to do here?

26:17.846 --> 26:19.547
He's our friend.

26:19.581 --> 26:21.082
Yeah, thank you, guys.

26:21.116 --> 26:23.018
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Okay, yeah.

26:23.051 --> 26:25.053
- Watch your feet.
- In the back.

26:25.086 --> 26:26.988
Oh, my God! Yeah!

26:27.022 --> 26:29.057
Yes. Thank you.
Thank you.

26:29.090 --> 26:30.925
At least some of you
have fucking souls.

26:30.959 --> 26:32.594
He has something
behind his back.

26:32.627 --> 26:34.795
Bobby, why have you got
a fucking knife?

26:34.828 --> 26:36.130
What are you doing, Bobby?

26:36.163 --> 26:37.631
He gave this to me, okay?

26:37.664 --> 26:39.566
Because I've got
the least amount of time.

26:39.600 --> 26:43.037
And now I am going to stab
that piece of shit right there.

26:43.070 --> 26:45.005
Get over here, Kato! Aah!

26:45.039 --> 26:47.041
- Whoa!
- What the fuck, Bobby?

26:47.074 --> 26:49.009
We're your friends.
Why are you doing this?

26:49.043 --> 26:51.645
Oh, please! Seriously.

26:51.678 --> 26:54.081
Why do you think any of us
ever hang out, huh?

26:54.114 --> 26:56.683
Huh? It's because of Caleb.

26:56.717 --> 26:58.152
And he is gone.

26:58.185 --> 27:00.953
So don't you tell me
that we are fucking friends.

27:00.987 --> 27:03.956
We are not fucking friends!

27:03.990 --> 27:05.224
Bobby, you're out of time.

27:05.258 --> 27:07.794
Oh, fuck me in my asshole.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.095
I'm sorry!

27:16.169 --> 27:18.204
Amber, here, come on.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.831
Rian.

27:45.864 --> 27:47.298
Oh, God.

27:47.331 --> 27:49.967
- Here, take my hand.
- I don't want your help, Ezra.

27:51.936 --> 27:53.971
No, no, guys, guys!

27:54.004 --> 27:55.773
Guys, stop!

27:55.806 --> 27:57.341
PJ, where are you?

27:57.374 --> 27:59.944
Guys, you got to come back!

27:59.977 --> 28:01.345
Rian...

28:03.080 --> 28:05.382
- Cici, wait up.
- Leave me alone, Ezra.

28:05.416 --> 28:08.652
- Just talk to me.
- You want to talk? Let's talk.

28:08.686 --> 28:10.820
She's here tonight,
isn't she?

28:10.854 --> 28:14.858
- The girl you're sleeping with.
- I don't know what to tell you.

28:14.891 --> 28:17.727
I didn't cheat on you.
I would never hurt you.

28:19.729 --> 28:22.265
Come on, Cici, what do I have
to do to prove myself to you?

28:22.298 --> 28:24.134
We're in the middle
of the fucking woods

28:24.167 --> 28:26.336
with bombs strapped
to our fucking chests.

28:26.369 --> 28:28.705
I am asking you to trust me.

28:28.738 --> 28:29.573
You're a cheat!

28:29.607 --> 28:31.941
You use women
and you discard them.

28:31.975 --> 28:34.877
And when you're done with them,
that's all you ever say.

28:34.910 --> 28:37.179
"Trust me. You can trust me."

28:37.212 --> 28:38.780
People that you can
actually trust

28:38.814 --> 28:41.850
don't have to convince you of it
all the time.

28:43.085 --> 28:46.355
Okay, this night
is already so fucked up.

28:48.223 --> 28:51.126
Can we just... just figure out
how to get out of here?

28:51.160 --> 28:54.363
Then we can talk,
we can do whatever.

28:54.396 --> 28:57.733
Let's just get out of here
first, please, babe.

28:57.766 --> 28:59.734
You've got 30 minutes.
I've got 40.

28:59.767 --> 29:02.803
Let's use this time
to figure this out.

29:02.837 --> 29:04.205
Come on, babe, please.

29:05.973 --> 29:07.808
I wish I had more time.

29:07.842 --> 29:09.076
We all do.

29:09.110 --> 29:11.379
So I can watch you die
in front of me.

29:15.116 --> 29:16.717
Fuck.

29:16.751 --> 29:18.219
Fuck me.

29:18.252 --> 29:20.788
What the fuck do we do?

29:20.821 --> 29:21.657
I don't know.

29:21.689 --> 29:23.723
Doesn't look like we got
a lot of choice.

29:23.757 --> 29:26.092
Peterson said the only one
to get out of here alive

29:26.126 --> 29:27.961
is the one with the most
amount of time.

29:27.994 --> 29:29.196
That's Shea. But why her?

29:29.229 --> 29:31.097
Whose dick did she suck
to get more time?

29:31.131 --> 29:34.968
Why the fuck would Bobby
act like that?

29:35.001 --> 29:36.169
Guy was a closet gay.

29:36.203 --> 29:38.805
Maybe he was just very,
very frustrated.

29:38.838 --> 29:40.106
Look on the bright side.

29:40.140 --> 29:41.408
At least now we know
what happens

29:41.442 --> 29:43.210
when these timers hit zero.

29:43.243 --> 29:44.744
Wait, that doesn't seem fair.

29:44.778 --> 29:47.846
So the rest of us have got
to wait to blow up?

29:47.880 --> 29:49.381
Kato, who's next?

29:49.415 --> 29:51.750
Who's got the least
amount of time?

29:51.784 --> 29:53.919
- Guys, where are you?
- Oh, shit.

29:53.953 --> 29:55.187
Guys?

29:55.221 --> 29:57.156
Guys, where are you?

30:00.893 --> 30:04.531
Stay green. Stay green.
Stay green!

30:04.564 --> 30:07.166
Shit! Rian!

30:12.370 --> 30:14.172
Oh, fucking Bobby.

30:16.575 --> 30:19.210
That's not going to heal.

30:19.244 --> 30:20.945
Oh, gross.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.085
Come on.

30:28.587 --> 30:29.887
Fuck.

30:38.228 --> 30:39.796
Oh, shit.

30:42.933 --> 30:44.502
Where are you guys?

30:46.870 --> 30:49.540
Where the fuck
are you guys?

30:54.211 --> 30:56.447
Rian? Rian?

30:56.481 --> 30:59.583
Rian, I'm sorry.
I don't know what to do.

30:59.616 --> 31:01.183
I'm about to blow up, babe.

31:01.217 --> 31:02.586
I want the green lights
to come back.

31:02.619 --> 31:04.454
What do I do?
Tell me what to do.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.490
- I don't know! I don't know!
- You don't know?

31:06.523 --> 31:09.025
You got to know what to do.
You always know what to do.

31:09.058 --> 31:11.294
- Say something clever.
- I'm sorry, PJ.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.828
I don't know what to do.
I'm sorry!

31:12.862 --> 31:14.397
I don't want to die. Please.

31:14.431 --> 31:16.265
Please, no, you got to get
away from me.

31:16.299 --> 31:17.900
No, PJ, no.

31:17.933 --> 31:20.936
No, I can't be around you.
No, get away from me!

31:20.970 --> 31:23.439
I don't want you to be around me
when this thing goes off.

31:23.472 --> 31:26.074
Hey, guys.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.612
That's a lot of blood.

31:35.216 --> 31:36.519
That wasn't an explosion.

31:36.552 --> 31:38.186
Well, then, what happened?

31:38.219 --> 31:39.354
Come on.

31:44.192 --> 31:46.360
What the fuck have I done?

31:46.393 --> 31:47.629
Oh, fuck.

31:47.662 --> 31:49.531
She came out of nowhere.

31:49.564 --> 31:52.434
- Rian, you got to believe me.
- No, no, no, no. Shea.

31:54.268 --> 31:56.070
Oh, fuck.

31:56.103 --> 31:58.072
Oh, no.

32:05.012 --> 32:06.548
She's dead.

32:08.483 --> 32:10.383
I didn't...

32:10.416 --> 32:12.486
I didn't see her
come up behind me.

32:12.519 --> 32:14.253
Don't do this to yourself.

32:14.287 --> 32:16.557
- She's dead. Fucking dead.
- Stop right now. Hey!

32:16.590 --> 32:20.159
Hey, PJ, we have to get
out of here.

32:20.193 --> 32:21.562
I...

32:21.595 --> 32:23.530
- I can't fucking leave her.
- She's dead, PJ!

32:23.564 --> 32:25.164
I can't leave her like that.

32:25.198 --> 32:27.900
Come on, PJ,
we have to find the others.

32:29.268 --> 32:32.004
Where are you?

32:32.038 --> 32:33.507
- This way.
- What was that?

32:33.540 --> 32:34.674
They're over there.

32:34.707 --> 32:36.942
What the fuck is happening?

32:36.975 --> 32:39.545
Holy shitballs,
what the fuck just happened?

32:39.579 --> 32:41.547
- It's Shea.
- We heard a scream.

32:41.581 --> 32:44.015
- Was that Shea?
- No, that was me.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.685
- Are you okay? What happened?
- What's going on?

32:45.718 --> 32:48.554
Why is there blood on your face,
PJ? You run into a tree?

32:48.588 --> 32:51.123
- Hey, guys.
- Fuck! Even your footsteps are quiet.

32:51.156 --> 32:54.427
- Sorry, where's Cici?
- What's going on here?

32:54.460 --> 32:56.462
She told me to get fucked
and ran off.

32:57.630 --> 33:01.533
Hey, drummer boy,
whose blood is that?

33:02.601 --> 33:04.935
Where's Shea, PJ?

33:04.969 --> 33:07.037
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

33:07.071 --> 33:08.640
Um, she...

33:08.673 --> 33:10.274
Something happened to her.

33:10.307 --> 33:11.909
What?

33:13.244 --> 33:15.379
What the fuck happened, PJ?

33:18.048 --> 33:19.150
She's dead.

33:21.385 --> 33:23.319
What the fuck did you do to her?

33:23.353 --> 33:24.655
It was an accident, man.

33:24.688 --> 33:26.457
She came up behind me,
I got a fright,

33:26.490 --> 33:27.725
I spun around and I hit her

33:27.758 --> 33:30.326
right in the head
with my flashlight.

33:30.360 --> 33:31.995
I hit her so fucking hard, man.

33:32.028 --> 33:33.731
- Jesus, dude.
- It happened so fast.

33:33.764 --> 33:36.199
I'm so fucking sorry, guys.
I'm so fucking sorry.

33:36.232 --> 33:39.169
Thought I was going to blow up.
I thought I was going to die.

33:40.370 --> 33:41.639
I'm so sorry.

33:43.373 --> 33:44.708
Why does he have
more time, now?

33:44.742 --> 33:46.743
Oh, fuck, now PJ has
more time than me.

33:46.776 --> 33:48.611
He's got more time
than everyone.

33:48.645 --> 33:50.012
He's fucking blue.

33:50.045 --> 33:52.047
- Who's got the least?
- Oh, shit.

33:52.080 --> 33:52.916
You.

33:52.948 --> 33:55.552
Guys, we have to find our cars.

33:55.585 --> 33:57.119
We don't have time for that.

33:57.152 --> 33:58.755
We don't have time for anything.

33:58.788 --> 34:00.690
Fuck, we're all going to die.

34:00.723 --> 34:02.759
- I don't want to die.
- Guys, give me a second.

34:02.792 --> 34:08.096
Shea had over 50 minutes left
when she died.

34:08.130 --> 34:11.098
PJ somehow
inherited her time.

34:12.266 --> 34:13.702
It makes sense, now.

34:13.735 --> 34:15.637
This is what Peterson
was getting at,

34:15.671 --> 34:18.607
why Bobby had the knife,
why he wanted to kill you, Kato.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.609
What the fuck are you
talking about?

34:20.642 --> 34:23.144
We can steal each other's time
to stay alive.

34:23.177 --> 34:26.013
Shea had 53 minutes left
on her timer when she...

34:26.047 --> 34:28.316
- When she was...
- What, murdered?

34:28.349 --> 34:30.051
Man, take it easy.

34:30.084 --> 34:31.753
Oh, come on.
Fucking say it like it is.

34:31.787 --> 34:34.522
PJ inherited
her remaining time.

34:34.555 --> 34:37.090
But how? Why'd PJ get the time?

34:37.123 --> 34:40.461
There must be sensors in here
to read...

34:40.495 --> 34:41.729
I don't know.

34:41.762 --> 34:44.432
Heartbeats, body heat,
could be anything.

34:44.465 --> 34:48.669
Closest person near someone
who dies must get the time.

34:48.703 --> 34:50.370
Proximity sensors.

34:50.403 --> 34:55.041
Okay, but why would Peterson
program the vests to do that?

34:55.075 --> 34:57.177
To incentivize us.

34:57.210 --> 35:00.145
To incentivize us to do what,
exactly?

35:01.380 --> 35:03.215
To kill each other

35:08.455 --> 35:12.358
The only way to stay alive

35:12.391 --> 35:14.293
is to take each other's time.

35:15.762 --> 35:18.732
So the more you kill,
the more time you get.

35:20.199 --> 35:22.668
Seems to be the high-level
summary.

35:22.701 --> 35:25.704
Why would Peterson
do something so evil?

35:25.738 --> 35:28.172
The fucker's obviously
off his rockers.

35:28.206 --> 35:30.776
Thinks we had something to do
with his son fucking OD'ing.

35:30.809 --> 35:32.845
We were all there that night.

35:32.878 --> 35:35.714
That doesn't make
any fucking sense.

35:35.748 --> 35:40.184
If he was so pissed that his son
was dead and we were all alive,

35:40.218 --> 35:43.187
then why didn't he just kill us
and get it all over with?

35:43.221 --> 35:45.457
That's fucking typical Peterson.

35:45.491 --> 35:47.425
A convoluted,
over-the-top lesson

35:47.458 --> 35:50.294
when a bullet to each
of our heads would've sufficed.

35:50.327 --> 35:52.329
He's the same dickhead teacher
he was five years ago.

35:52.362 --> 35:54.866
Joke's on him.
I mean, no one here is capable

35:54.899 --> 35:57.735
of murdering anyone else,
right?

35:57.769 --> 35:59.604
No, no, no, no, no.

35:59.637 --> 36:01.606
Don't try and fucking
manipulate me like that.

36:01.639 --> 36:03.240
Don't fucking try.

36:03.273 --> 36:05.242
No, I'm not going to wait around
here and be killed,

36:05.275 --> 36:07.277
not after your fucking
boyfriend has gone

36:07.311 --> 36:10.212
all Lord of the Fucking Flies
on one of our friends.

36:10.246 --> 36:12.348
Back up, bro.
I said it was an accident.

36:12.381 --> 36:15.251
And what happens when there's
another accident, bro?

36:15.284 --> 36:16.887
Just put the crowbar down.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.689
No, I think I'm going to hold on
to it, thanks.

36:18.722 --> 36:21.491
We're dead if we let
our emotions rule us.

36:21.525 --> 36:23.225
We're all dead,
no matter what.

36:23.259 --> 36:26.630
Peterson said that only
one of us gets to survive.

36:26.663 --> 36:30.634
That means whoever
has the most time.

36:30.667 --> 36:33.369
I.e., your fucking
deadbeat boyfriend.

36:33.402 --> 36:35.504
Deadbeat?
Hey, fuck you.

36:35.538 --> 36:38.774
Come on, take it easy. We have to work together.

36:38.808 --> 36:40.776
Ask Shea how
that worked out for her.

36:40.810 --> 36:42.310
Shut the fuck up, Kato.

36:42.344 --> 36:44.312
Look, we're either
all with each other or...

36:44.346 --> 36:46.782
- No. It's every man for himself.
- And woman.

36:46.816 --> 36:48.584
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- No, shit.

36:48.618 --> 36:50.185
You knew exactly
what I meant.

36:50.218 --> 36:51.654
Now isn't the time
to be a bitch.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.388
- We need to strategize.
- Strategize?

36:53.422 --> 36:54.924
You're thinking strategy?

36:54.957 --> 36:58.258
- Like, how to kill us all?
- I'm thinking how not to die.

36:58.292 --> 37:00.595
Pretty soon, everyone here
is going to be doing

37:00.629 --> 37:02.497
the exact same thing.

37:02.530 --> 37:03.798
Some people are getting edgy,

37:03.832 --> 37:05.533
trying to get a head start
on the game.

37:05.567 --> 37:08.168
- Some people are collecting weapons.
- Weapons?

37:08.202 --> 37:10.371
No, this is a fucking tool,
you tool.

37:10.404 --> 37:11.873
This is to get this shit off.

37:11.906 --> 37:13.842
PJ, we should get out of here.

37:13.875 --> 37:16.176
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

37:16.210 --> 37:18.680
Of fucking course,
take your blue-vested boyfriend

37:18.713 --> 37:19.848
and get the fuck
out of here.

37:19.881 --> 37:21.849
Protect him from reality
like you did

37:21.882 --> 37:23.517
back in fucking high school.

37:23.550 --> 37:26.720
We can't just sit here
and wait this out, Ezra.

37:26.754 --> 37:29.188
Time is a precious resource
right now,

37:29.222 --> 37:31.492
and I'm not going to wait around
to try and convince you.

37:31.525 --> 37:33.627
It's crazy.
We have to try and get help.

37:33.661 --> 37:35.228
It's better if we...

37:35.261 --> 37:37.598
Oh, for fuck's sake,
speak up.

37:37.631 --> 37:40.233
- Better if we what?
- We're away from each other.

37:41.535 --> 37:43.369
So that another...

37:43.403 --> 37:45.772
No one else gets hurt.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.640
You know, you kept your mouth
shut for so long,

37:47.674 --> 37:49.876
I really thought you'd come up
with something better than that.

37:49.909 --> 37:52.912
Hey, no, she's fucking right,
dude.

37:52.945 --> 37:54.747
No one here knows
what they're gonna do

37:54.781 --> 37:56.248
when they have 30 seconds left.

37:56.281 --> 37:58.751
Dude, in horror movies,
when people split up,

37:58.785 --> 38:00.218
that's right before they die.

38:00.252 --> 38:01.921
Well, yeah,
but in horror movies,

38:01.954 --> 38:05.792
the fucking bad guy isn't,
you know, all the good guys.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.994
That's it. We all just go
our separate ways.

38:13.432 --> 38:15.867
Whoa! Just run, Rian!

38:20.939 --> 38:22.974
Fucking psycho!

38:25.811 --> 38:27.512
Run, Amber!

38:27.546 --> 38:30.247
This is not a
situation I'm used to, Kato.

38:32.851 --> 38:34.785
Oh, for fuck's sake.

38:34.819 --> 38:36.252
Where the fuck are you guys?

38:43.828 --> 38:45.830
Wait up, Kato.
This thing is heavy.

38:45.863 --> 38:47.698
Down here.

38:51.702 --> 38:53.269
Come on.

38:53.303 --> 38:55.906
We have to get to Route 4
before anyone else does.

39:02.512 --> 39:03.813
I think we're safe.

39:03.847 --> 39:05.582
Right now,
you're the biggest target.

39:05.615 --> 39:07.282
If anyone wants
to play the game,

39:07.316 --> 39:09.384
they'll come after the person
with the most time.

39:09.419 --> 39:11.821
- So no, PJ, we're not safe.
- I'm an endangered species.

39:11.855 --> 39:13.890
Look at me.
We're not dying here tonight.

39:13.923 --> 39:16.291
Not here in these woods
like this.

39:16.325 --> 39:18.327
- Okay.
- Let's go.

39:29.538 --> 39:30.973
It's not here.

39:31.006 --> 39:33.475
Peterson's gun is missing.

39:34.743 --> 39:37.045
What does...
What does that mean?

39:37.079 --> 39:39.081
It means that someone out here
really wants to win already.

39:39.114 --> 39:41.049
I don't know if I can do it, I...

39:41.083 --> 39:43.018
I don't think I could
kill someone,

39:43.051 --> 39:44.787
let alone my best friend.

39:44.820 --> 39:46.587
Wake up, Amber.

39:46.621 --> 39:48.923
You saw how we all scattered
like cockroaches

39:48.956 --> 39:50.491
the second we faced
a flicker of adversity.

39:50.525 --> 39:52.026
None of us are really
friends anymore.

39:52.059 --> 39:53.561
We can't trust anyone.

39:53.594 --> 39:54.729
We have to get out of here.

39:54.762 --> 39:56.030
And go where?

39:56.964 --> 39:58.599
Erin, is that you?

39:58.633 --> 40:01.602
Hey, you okay?

40:01.636 --> 40:03.336
Get back!

40:03.370 --> 40:05.706
You should go and find Cici.
She needs you.

40:05.740 --> 40:07.475
Cici thinks I cheated on her.

40:07.508 --> 40:09.743
She wanted to kill me
long before she had a bomb

40:09.776 --> 40:11.912
strapped to her chest.

40:11.945 --> 40:14.781
No, come on. Wait, please.
No, come on, come back.

40:14.815 --> 40:16.616
Look...

40:16.650 --> 40:19.419
I don't know what's going
to happen tonight, okay?

40:19.452 --> 40:22.455
But everyone else seems to have
their teammates, except us.

40:22.489 --> 40:23.890
We were left out.

40:23.924 --> 40:25.759
What are you saying?

40:25.792 --> 40:28.628
I need you to look out for me?

40:28.662 --> 40:32.966
No. I'm saying that you need
a partner and I need a partner.

40:32.999 --> 40:34.767
You know, someone to...

40:34.800 --> 40:36.367
Well, you know...

40:36.402 --> 40:37.803
You just want to keep me around

40:37.837 --> 40:39.505
because you think
I'm an easy kill.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.841
Like life insurance
for when you've run out of time.

40:41.874 --> 40:43.709
Don't think like that, please.

40:43.742 --> 40:47.112
I'm not going to be able to do
anything when the time comes.

40:47.146 --> 40:48.781
Hell, I can even eat gluten.

40:48.814 --> 40:51.083
Trust me, I'm not going to be
able to kill anyone.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.953
Why should I trust you?
Your girlfriend doesn't.

40:53.986 --> 40:55.788
You don't even know
my last name.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.622
Erin, come on.

40:57.655 --> 41:00.491
We've been in the same group of
friends for over five years now,

41:00.525 --> 41:02.060
and you know nothing
about me.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.895
I think this is the longest
we've ever spoken.

41:03.928 --> 41:07.665
I didn't cheat on Cici,
all right?

41:07.699 --> 41:09.767
She's paranoid, all right?

41:09.801 --> 41:12.537
Now no one can be around someone
who's happy to assume

41:12.570 --> 41:13.805
the worst of others.

41:13.838 --> 41:15.807
You get that, right?

41:15.840 --> 41:17.408
I can't be around someone

41:17.442 --> 41:20.377
who's looking for permission
to kill me.

41:22.779 --> 41:24.081
Besides...

41:25.616 --> 41:27.451
I have more time than you.

41:27.484 --> 41:30.687
So you're going to come after me
way before I come after you.

41:30.721 --> 41:32.489
And it's Coleman.

41:33.991 --> 41:36.460
Your last name is Coleman.

41:38.128 --> 41:39.830
Fine.

41:39.863 --> 41:41.498
Fine, we're good?

41:41.531 --> 41:43.834
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:43.867 --> 41:45.668
Let's go.

41:45.701 --> 41:47.203
Where, Ezra?

41:47.236 --> 41:50.072
To the next camp.
Maybe they've got a car.

41:50.106 --> 41:52.041
How many people did we pass
on the way here?

41:52.074 --> 41:53.709
It's like Bobby said.

41:53.743 --> 41:56.045
Everyone's in town
for the big game tomorrow.

41:56.078 --> 41:57.713
We're the only idiots
camping out here,

41:57.747 --> 42:00.583
and it's at least 30 miles
back to town.

42:00.616 --> 42:01.851
We won't make it.

42:01.884 --> 42:03.953
Well, maybe they got
a ranger station

42:03.986 --> 42:06.956
or something out here, right?

42:06.989 --> 42:08.758
We have to find someone
who can help us.

42:08.791 --> 42:11.693
Let's just get to the road and
we'll figure it out from there.

42:11.726 --> 42:12.994
Come on.

42:14.562 --> 42:16.731
Come on, Erin.

42:16.765 --> 42:19.467
We need to survive long
enough until help gets here.

42:19.501 --> 42:21.002
How are we going to get help?

42:21.036 --> 42:22.771
In an hour we're all
forest confetti,

42:22.804 --> 42:24.205
and all of our phones are gone.

42:24.239 --> 42:26.508
Do you think my dad would let me
be away from him

42:26.541 --> 42:28.243
for a whole weekend in the deep,
dark woods

42:28.276 --> 42:30.612
with just one cell phone?

42:30.645 --> 42:31.947
I love your dad.

42:34.081 --> 42:36.750
Ezra! I'm sorry!

42:36.784 --> 42:39.753
I have no fucking idea
where to go, do you?

42:39.787 --> 42:43.023
Something must have pushed
Peterson off the edge.

42:44.291 --> 42:45.693
Did he say anything to you?

42:45.726 --> 42:47.861
Did you speak to him
after the funeral?

42:47.895 --> 42:49.663
Why is he fucking
with us now?

42:51.098 --> 42:53.500
- Okay, where are we looking?
- One of the big ones.

42:53.534 --> 42:55.769
Come on, baby.
Come on. Come on.

42:56.937 --> 42:58.171
It's got to be here.

43:04.043 --> 43:05.645
Are you sure you packed it?

43:05.678 --> 43:07.847
I wouldn't make a
stupid mistake like that.

43:07.880 --> 43:09.182
It must be here.

43:09.215 --> 43:11.150
My dad even handed it to me.

43:11.184 --> 43:13.252
He made sure it was charged
and everything.

43:13.286 --> 43:15.021
- Keep looking, PJ.
- Yes.

43:15.054 --> 43:17.056
I don't know,
maybe Peterson took it.

43:17.090 --> 43:19.092
Dickhead thought
of everything else.

43:21.994 --> 43:23.228
Make sure you check the bottoms.

43:23.261 --> 43:25.097
Make sure you check
the whole bag.

43:30.335 --> 43:33.171
- Here, PJ, try this one.
- Yeah, got it.

43:35.107 --> 43:38.243
Yeah, come on. Come on.

43:39.878 --> 43:41.913
Shit.

43:45.250 --> 43:47.585
I got nothing, babe.

43:47.618 --> 43:50.221
Stop. Stop.

43:50.254 --> 43:52.189
You hear that?

43:54.358 --> 43:57.795
I don't want to die alone!

43:57.828 --> 43:59.697
We should try
and help her, right?

43:59.730 --> 44:01.999
Maybe unscrew the vest
with my knife.

44:02.033 --> 44:03.601
Oh, we can't.

44:03.634 --> 44:06.137
What? Rian, she's our friend.

44:06.170 --> 44:08.706
- Do you really...?
- Shh.

44:13.877 --> 44:15.278
Ezra!

44:17.647 --> 44:18.848
Where are you?

44:27.357 --> 44:29.659
Keep looking, PJ.

44:29.692 --> 44:30.794
Okay.

44:36.899 --> 44:38.267
Where is it?

44:44.173 --> 44:47.142
- Shit.
- Shh.

45:01.055 --> 45:03.224
Come on. Come on. Come on.

45:04.692 --> 45:06.360
What's this? No.

45:08.863 --> 45:10.765
Oh.

45:37.791 --> 45:39.893
- Stop complaining.
- Fuck off.

45:41.161 --> 45:42.929
Come on.

45:42.963 --> 45:44.197
Fuck off!

45:44.231 --> 45:46.265
Doesn't matter.

45:55.774 --> 45:56.909
She's gone.

46:00.480 --> 46:02.181
- Any service?
- Nada.

46:02.214 --> 46:04.183
Okay, let's get out
of this valley.

46:04.216 --> 46:05.684
Yeah.

46:09.287 --> 46:10.989
Oh, PJ, come on!

46:11.022 --> 46:12.891
Hold on a second.

46:12.924 --> 46:15.360
- Oh, yeah.
- What the fuck are you doing?

46:15.394 --> 46:17.195
If we have it,
no one else does, right?

46:17.228 --> 46:18.397
Let's just go, please.

46:18.430 --> 46:20.064
Were you always like this,

46:20.098 --> 46:21.699
so closed off,

46:21.733 --> 46:23.868
or is that something that
happened after Caleb died?

46:23.902 --> 46:27.972
It was my party where he had
his heart attack.

46:29.073 --> 46:30.708
I tried to revive him, but...

46:30.742 --> 46:33.011
Seriously, you're not going
to respond to that?

46:33.044 --> 46:35.946
Come on, you can't keep
all of that bottled up.

46:35.979 --> 46:38.348
It's not good for you.

46:38.382 --> 46:40.117
To you, Caleb was the quiet
smart kid

46:40.150 --> 46:41.285
who you maybe copied off of.

46:41.318 --> 46:42.753
Are you kidding me?

46:42.786 --> 46:44.721
That guy was in
Advanced Placement classes.

46:44.755 --> 46:46.391
I was, like,
one notch above Special Ed.

46:46.424 --> 46:48.892
Caleb was my boyfriend, Ezra.

46:48.926 --> 46:51.762
He was the first boy
I was ever with.

46:51.795 --> 46:53.464
And the last.

46:53.498 --> 46:56.800
So, yeah, it affected me.

46:56.833 --> 46:59.769
You know, there's no shame
in talking about it.

46:59.802 --> 47:03.139
Or admitting
that it changed you.

47:03.172 --> 47:05.442
Because it changed me.

47:05.475 --> 47:09.879
Watching someone
so smart and caring

47:09.912 --> 47:11.948
with a future
that was so promising...

47:13.115 --> 47:15.251
poof, gone in an instant.

47:17.053 --> 47:18.854
It flipped a switch in me.

47:18.888 --> 47:20.990
Made me realize
that there's no points

47:21.023 --> 47:22.458
for doing the right thing.

47:22.491 --> 47:26.495
People are shit, and they do
shitty things, okay?

47:26.529 --> 47:29.297
If you're not a user,
you're probably being used.

47:30.499 --> 47:32.535
You're just as pathetic as me.

47:32.568 --> 47:35.937
This loner rebel bullshit
routine of yours,

47:35.971 --> 47:37.473
so forced and fake.

47:38.541 --> 47:39.941
Come on.

47:42.511 --> 47:44.447
Erin would probably
be the easiest.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.080
Wouldn't even
cry for help.

47:46.113 --> 47:48.483
Yeah, but who
deserves it the most?

47:48.516 --> 47:50.251
Oh, that goes without saying.

47:50.284 --> 47:51.453
Oh, who?

47:56.857 --> 47:59.494
I guess I've never
really trusted Kato, you know?

47:59.527 --> 48:02.896
One time, I saw the guy
put ice in milk, Rian.

48:02.930 --> 48:04.932
- Ice in milk.
- There's still no service.

48:04.965 --> 48:06.568
We got to go higher.

48:06.601 --> 48:09.103
Oh, fuck.

48:09.135 --> 48:11.405
Your psychotic best friend's
been here.

48:14.974 --> 48:16.477
Cici?

48:17.411 --> 48:19.379
You here, babe?

48:20.913 --> 48:22.583
I don't like this.
Let's get out of here.

48:22.616 --> 48:24.250
Hey, weirdo!

48:31.124 --> 48:32.292
What are you doing?

48:32.325 --> 48:33.825
Back off, Amber!

48:33.859 --> 48:35.395
I don't want to hurt you.

48:35.428 --> 48:36.995
But I've got to kill him.

48:37.029 --> 48:38.930
This is not cool, Cici!

48:38.964 --> 48:42.367
This is not how best friends
treat each other.

48:43.902 --> 48:46.472
No.

48:46.506 --> 48:48.140
Why aren't you with Ezra, hmm?

48:48.173 --> 48:49.509
It's complicated.

48:49.542 --> 48:52.512
It's either you or Amber.

48:52.545 --> 48:54.379
I don't want to kill
my best friend.

48:54.414 --> 48:55.615
We can help you.

48:55.648 --> 48:58.849
We can help you find Ezra
together,

48:58.883 --> 49:01.118
and help you get his time.

49:01.152 --> 49:03.422
You should survive.
Not him.

49:03.455 --> 49:05.424
No, she'll never
make it in time.

49:05.457 --> 49:07.958
Oh, Jesus Christ, Amber.
Seriously?

49:07.992 --> 49:09.494
- Rules are rules. I'm sorry.
- Wait!

49:09.528 --> 49:12.163
- Wait, Ezra was cheating on you.
- No.

49:12.196 --> 49:13.297
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:13.331 --> 49:14.865
But he was cheating on you...

49:14.899 --> 49:16.000
with Amber.

49:17.201 --> 49:19.003
Oh, yeah. Plot twist.

49:19.036 --> 49:21.204
- What?
- No!

49:21.237 --> 49:22.506
He's... He's lying.

49:22.540 --> 49:26.577
I would never
fuck your boyfriend, Cici.

49:26.610 --> 49:27.977
It's true.

49:28.011 --> 49:29.879
I went through her phone
the other day.

49:29.913 --> 49:31.314
They were definitely fucking.

49:31.348 --> 49:34.050
They've been texting
sweet nothings for weeks.

49:34.084 --> 49:36.587
He even sent her a dick pic.
Average length.

49:36.620 --> 49:38.188
Kind of curved to the left.

49:38.221 --> 49:40.591
Terrible, terrible manscaping.

49:40.624 --> 49:42.359
I don't know if it's still
going on.

49:42.393 --> 49:46.028
- Slut.
- Last I saw, he accused her of giving him herpes.

49:46.061 --> 49:48.931
That's insane!
I don't even have herpes!

49:48.964 --> 49:50.433
Yeah you do.
You got it from me.

49:50.467 --> 49:52.368
- Fuck you!
- And you gave it to Ezra.

49:52.402 --> 49:55.605
And Ezra gave it to me,
you bitch!

49:55.638 --> 49:59.341
I've been taking pills
for months to get rid of this.

49:59.375 --> 50:01.578
It's a very,
very resilient disease.

50:01.611 --> 50:03.345
Come on, you don't want
to kill me.

50:03.380 --> 50:04.614
Yes, I do.

50:04.647 --> 50:06.348
That's the herpes talking.

50:06.383 --> 50:09.083
Please! Please! No!
I'm pregnant.

50:10.184 --> 50:11.319
Please.

50:11.352 --> 50:13.087
I'm pregnant, Cici.

50:13.121 --> 50:15.624
I'm going to be a mom.

50:15.657 --> 50:17.158
Bitch. No, you ain't.

50:17.191 --> 50:18.427
- Yeah!
- Aah!

50:18.460 --> 50:20.294
Oh, shit.

50:24.533 --> 50:26.934
I'm so sorry.

50:26.968 --> 50:28.570
Oh, my... Amber.

50:28.604 --> 50:30.138
What have I done?

50:39.279 --> 50:42.249
Amber, I'm so sorry.
What do I do?

50:42.282 --> 50:44.184
Is it in the ovaries?

50:45.586 --> 50:47.588
Are you...? I'm so sorry, Amber.

50:47.622 --> 50:49.390
Amber, I'm so sorry!

50:49.424 --> 50:51.124
Amber.

50:51.158 --> 50:53.160
Amber, I'm so...

51:03.703 --> 51:06.640
That is really, really intense.

51:17.049 --> 51:18.250
Fuck.

51:22.455 --> 51:24.457
Any luck?

51:24.490 --> 51:26.459
Yeah. I got two bars.

51:26.492 --> 51:27.992
Finally.

51:30.796 --> 51:32.665
Whoa. Whoa.

51:32.698 --> 51:35.468
- Oh.
- That's not a good sign, right?

51:39.405 --> 51:41.407
Oh, fuck.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.041
- Ezra.
- Shit.

51:43.074 --> 51:44.275
Someone's dead.

51:44.309 --> 51:46.243
I didn't hear an explosion,
so...

51:46.276 --> 51:48.045
People are playing the game.

51:48.078 --> 51:49.514
Oh, fuck me.

51:49.547 --> 51:51.483
Time to pop
my murder cherry.

51:53.050 --> 51:54.184
Cici.

51:56.387 --> 51:57.722
Wait. What?

51:58.623 --> 52:00.458
You killed her?

52:00.492 --> 52:01.759
I did it.

52:03.160 --> 52:04.294
I did it.

52:04.328 --> 52:06.498
I-I killed my best friend.

52:06.531 --> 52:09.031
I took all her time.

52:09.065 --> 52:10.501
That is next-level savage.
I...

52:10.534 --> 52:12.736
I could actually
win this thing.

52:12.769 --> 52:15.104
You know to win this,
you have to kill me, right?

52:18.174 --> 52:23.045
We... We've got to do
what we can to survive.

52:24.681 --> 52:26.215
That's what you did.
You...

52:26.249 --> 52:29.252
you left me alone with her
to get the ax.

52:29.285 --> 52:31.320
You set Cici on me.

52:31.354 --> 52:33.489
You... It's cool.

52:33.523 --> 52:34.790
I know.

52:34.824 --> 52:37.058
I don't blame you
for what you did. You...

52:37.760 --> 52:39.395
you knew I could do it.

52:39.428 --> 52:41.196
I just needed a push.

52:43.131 --> 52:47.737
The biggest mistake
that people are going to make

52:47.770 --> 52:50.673
is thinking
that they have to wait

52:50.706 --> 52:53.275
until someone's in the red
to kill.

52:53.308 --> 52:55.243
We can jump all of them.

52:55.277 --> 52:57.111
We can get the most time.

52:57.144 --> 53:00.314
And then we can figure a way
out of here.

53:00.347 --> 53:04.519
Because there's way too many
nice people

53:04.553 --> 53:09.391
ignoring the very horrible game
that we're being forced to play.

53:09.424 --> 53:10.825
So, babe...

53:13.595 --> 53:15.329
who do we kill next?

53:20.435 --> 53:22.736
He's still not picking up.

53:23.904 --> 53:26.640
- Well, try him again.
- Okay.

53:32.379 --> 53:33.747
Ezra, wait.

53:37.283 --> 53:39.085
Did you hear that?

53:40.888 --> 53:43.122
- It's coming from here.
- It's nothing.

53:46.559 --> 53:47.827
Yeah, you're probably right.

53:52.699 --> 53:54.333
No.

53:54.366 --> 53:56.201
No, I'm not.

53:56.234 --> 53:58.671
Grow a fucking backbone,
I think you're onto something.

53:58.705 --> 54:00.807
- Let's go.
- Seriously?

54:01.708 --> 54:03.376
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

54:03.409 --> 54:06.244
Maybe he's just listening
to that Cock Tumor EP I gave him

54:06.278 --> 54:07.747
for his birthday
three years ago,

54:07.780 --> 54:09.648
and he just can't
hear the phone.

54:10.882 --> 54:13.250
Maybe he's just
a really deep sleeper.

54:13.284 --> 54:16.187
My dad sleeps with one eye open
and the ringer on full blast

54:16.220 --> 54:17.723
three feet from his head.

54:17.756 --> 54:20.459
Something's not right.
I'm going to track his phone.

54:20.492 --> 54:22.394
Okay. Okay.

54:24.195 --> 54:25.397
And?

54:26.465 --> 54:28.332
It's searching.

54:30.802 --> 54:32.303
It's zoning in.

54:34.739 --> 54:36.374
- PJ, let's go.
- What?

54:36.407 --> 54:39.377
It says it's 400 yards away
over there.

54:39.410 --> 54:40.778
Come on!

54:45.483 --> 54:47.618
Erin. Erin, be careful.

54:47.652 --> 54:48.853
Who's that?

54:48.886 --> 54:50.554
Who the fuck is that?

54:50.588 --> 54:52.490
Help me.

54:52.523 --> 54:54.525
Help me, please.

54:55.826 --> 54:58.260
- Holy shit.
- Mr. Miller?

54:58.995 --> 55:00.664
It's me. It's Erin.

55:00.697 --> 55:02.432
Are you okay?

55:02.465 --> 55:04.333
Rian? Rian?

55:04.367 --> 55:05.702
Is Rian okay?

55:05.735 --> 55:07.537
Last we saw,
she was in one piece, yeah.

55:07.570 --> 55:10.640
Jesus Christ.
He got all of you out here?

55:12.442 --> 55:14.377
Help me out of this
fucking wire.

55:14.411 --> 55:16.413
Please, Erin.
I don't have a lot of time.

55:16.446 --> 55:18.581
Why has Peterson done this?
What did we do to him?

55:18.615 --> 55:22.718
Peterson is convinced
his son's death wasn't natural.

55:22.751 --> 55:24.285
That's crazy.

55:24.318 --> 55:26.655
Everyone knows Caleb
had a heart condition.

55:26.689 --> 55:27.856
That's what I told him.

55:27.890 --> 55:29.725
So I closed the case.

55:29.758 --> 55:31.359
I thought it was over.

55:31.393 --> 55:34.563
I thought... I thought
we could go on with our lives.

55:34.596 --> 55:36.565
But he kept digging.

55:36.598 --> 55:41.570
Got his hookups at the
university to run more fuck...

55:41.603 --> 55:43.005
Fucking blood tests.

55:43.038 --> 55:45.506
They discovered that Caleb
had a lethal dose of speed

55:45.540 --> 55:48.710
in his system, and that's what
caused the heart attack.

55:48.743 --> 55:51.311
So, what, Caleb had a bum ticker

55:51.344 --> 55:53.381
and accidentally did too much
molly at my party?

55:53.414 --> 55:55.416
How does that justify
putting us in these things?

55:55.450 --> 55:57.552
Oh, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

55:57.585 --> 56:01.288
Caleb had five times
the lethal dose in his system.

56:01.321 --> 56:03.958
Peterson is convinced somebody
was slipping it into his drink

56:03.991 --> 56:05.793
the entire night.

56:05.827 --> 56:08.762
So Caleb was poisoned
by someone at my party?

56:08.795 --> 56:11.330
You're saying someone
in these woods

56:11.364 --> 56:13.366
is a cold-blooded murderer?

56:18.739 --> 56:20.540
Guys?

56:22.476 --> 56:24.444
Oh!

56:25.979 --> 56:27.848
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

56:29.449 --> 56:31.618
You hear that?

56:31.651 --> 56:33.385
Go. Quick, hide.

56:37.623 --> 56:39.391
Who is it?

56:42.661 --> 56:44.029
It's Kato.

56:44.063 --> 56:45.865
Fuck. We've got to run.

56:50.002 --> 56:51.937
Go, go, go, go.

56:51.971 --> 56:53.839
Go, run. Go. Go. Go!

57:01.079 --> 57:03.047
Guys?

57:03.081 --> 57:04.482
Help.

57:09.053 --> 57:11.623
- Rian, move.
- I'm coming.

57:14.759 --> 57:16.661
Guys, come on.

57:16.694 --> 57:19.531
We're hurt real bad down here.

57:25.536 --> 57:26.670
This is ridiculous.

57:27.938 --> 57:29.406
I got to go talk to him.

57:29.439 --> 57:30.641
No! Fuck, no.

57:30.674 --> 57:32.843
Come on.
He's our friend.

57:32.876 --> 57:34.444
He's not going to do
anything to us.

57:34.478 --> 57:36.680
- And besides, he's hurt.
- No, no, no, no.

57:36.713 --> 57:38.048
It's Kato.

57:38.081 --> 57:39.750
He's fucking scared
of mosquitoes.

57:39.783 --> 57:41.585
I got to try.

57:42.619 --> 57:44.087
Babe, please!

57:44.121 --> 57:46.956
Kato! I'm coming, bro!

57:46.989 --> 57:49.425
I don't want any bullshit
trouble, okay?

57:49.458 --> 57:50.660
Kato?

57:55.865 --> 57:57.700
Kato?

57:57.733 --> 57:59.368
Amber?

57:59.402 --> 58:01.938
- PJ, buddy, please.
- Kato, where are you guys?

58:01.971 --> 58:03.873
We got to stick together, man.

58:03.906 --> 58:05.408
Kato?

58:08.510 --> 58:09.477
Kato.

58:09.511 --> 58:10.979
Right here, drummer boy.

58:11.012 --> 58:12.113
What the hell, man?

58:12.147 --> 58:13.648
You're not even triggered.

58:13.682 --> 58:14.916
You're green.

58:14.950 --> 58:18.019
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

58:18.053 --> 58:19.988
It's perfectly acceptable
to hate the player

58:20.021 --> 58:21.790
when the player's being
a total dick.

58:23.158 --> 58:25.660
It doesn't matter what Peterson
wants us to do.

58:25.694 --> 58:27.629
This nightmare that we've
woken up in,

58:27.662 --> 58:30.999
we got to find a way out of here
and we need to do it quick.

58:31.032 --> 58:32.467
Oh, it'll be over quick.

58:32.499 --> 58:34.869
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

58:34.902 --> 58:37.605
Son of a bitch!

58:38.639 --> 58:40.608
No! No!

58:40.641 --> 58:42.877
Man, I'm so sorry.
I didn't see the leg.

58:42.910 --> 58:44.745
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

58:50.050 --> 58:52.086
Fuck, man, you've gone
all Jason Bateman on me.

58:52.119 --> 58:53.821
You mean Patrick Bateman,
you idiot.

58:53.854 --> 58:54.989
From "American Psycho."

58:55.022 --> 58:57.023
Well, then who's Jason Bateman?

58:57.056 --> 58:59.125
He's from
"Arrested Development."

58:59.158 --> 59:01.027
Jeez, you are an idiot,
aren't you?

59:01.060 --> 59:02.762
Patrick Bateman...

59:04.631 --> 59:05.765
Fuck this.

59:15.541 --> 59:18.745
Is that all you got,
you hippie fuck?

59:31.189 --> 59:32.891
What are you doing, Amber?

59:35.093 --> 59:36.695
Leave us alone!

59:37.996 --> 59:40.465
- There we go.
- Kato, please stop.

59:40.499 --> 59:42.000
Kato.

59:44.702 --> 59:47.705
I've hated you since
fucking grade school, you bitch!

59:47.738 --> 59:49.073
Aah!

1:00:00.985 --> 1:00:03.120
I'm going to kill you!

1:00:03.154 --> 1:00:05.122
Hold still.

1:00:05.156 --> 1:00:07.692
No, Kato, Kato, Kato.
No, no, no, no.

1:00:07.725 --> 1:00:09.526
No, no, no, no. Aah!

1:00:14.864 --> 1:00:17.567
Now that's what I call a drum solo.

1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:19.002
Ha!

1:00:22.005 --> 1:00:24.240
PJ!

1:00:24.274 --> 1:00:26.676
Time to level up.

1:00:28.278 --> 1:00:30.981
I knew you were a fucking psycho

1:00:31.014 --> 1:00:33.248
when you didn't cry at the end
of "Terminator 2."

1:00:33.282 --> 1:00:35.117
Almost there, almost there.

1:00:35.150 --> 1:00:38.988
Mr. Miller, please. Please.

1:00:39.021 --> 1:00:42.157
We have to get you back to camp.
There's a first aid kit there.

1:00:42.191 --> 1:00:45.060
He's going to need more
than a first aid kit.

1:00:45.094 --> 1:00:47.096
- Let me help you.
- Oh, fuck.

1:00:47.129 --> 1:00:49.565
He's crashing harder
than Bitcoin.

1:00:49.598 --> 1:00:51.100
This is funny.

1:00:51.133 --> 1:00:54.269
When you kill someone
with any other weapon,

1:00:54.303 --> 1:00:56.838
you're just a regular
old murderer.

1:00:56.871 --> 1:01:00.708
But as soon as you use an ax,
you're an ax murderer.

1:01:00.742 --> 1:01:02.076
Why is that, PJ?

1:01:02.110 --> 1:01:04.312
Well, if I were to posit...

1:01:09.017 --> 1:01:11.786
You son of a bitch!

1:01:11.819 --> 1:01:14.255
Oh!

1:01:14.288 --> 1:01:16.891
Erin, you're wasting the time
you have left.

1:01:16.924 --> 1:01:18.760
When is doing the right thing
a waste of time?

1:01:18.793 --> 1:01:20.294
You're not gonna be much help to
him

1:01:20.327 --> 1:01:21.895
if you're around him
in five minutes.

1:01:21.928 --> 1:01:23.764
Mr. Miller, where's your phone?

1:01:23.797 --> 1:01:26.199
- It's in there.
- I got it. I've got it.

1:01:26.233 --> 1:01:28.568
I'll find help, okay?

1:01:28.602 --> 1:01:31.638
Here piggy, piggy, piggy!

1:01:32.773 --> 1:01:34.808
9-1-1.

1:01:36.810 --> 1:01:38.078
Hello?

1:01:38.111 --> 1:01:39.780
Oh, thank God.

1:01:39.813 --> 1:01:41.181
My name's Erin Coleman.

1:01:41.214 --> 1:01:43.784
No, I can't give you
my location.

1:01:43.817 --> 1:01:46.185
Look, this is an emergency.
Please, I need help.

1:01:50.390 --> 1:01:52.758
Oh, shit.

1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:02.234
I'm sorry, man.

1:02:03.370 --> 1:02:04.837
Hello?

1:02:04.870 --> 1:02:06.605
Get here quick, please.

1:02:06.639 --> 1:02:09.874
There's blood.
Lots of blood. Hello?

1:02:09.908 --> 1:02:12.177
Fuck. It's dead.

1:02:13.311 --> 1:02:15.180
Do you know anything
about the vests?

1:02:15.213 --> 1:02:17.048
How to disarm them?

1:02:17.082 --> 1:02:19.717
The fucker had two controllers

1:02:19.751 --> 1:02:23.154
or... or detonators,
one to tu...

1:02:23.188 --> 1:02:25.090
One to turn the bombs on,
and one to...

1:02:26.291 --> 1:02:27.625
To turn them off?

1:02:27.659 --> 1:02:29.994
Yeah. Get those.

1:02:30.028 --> 1:02:32.830
Find those. He had them on him
when he tied me up.

1:02:32.863 --> 1:02:35.032
- Erin.
- Yes?

1:02:38.135 --> 1:02:39.269
Tell Rian...

1:02:39.303 --> 1:02:40.971
Tell Rian that I...

1:02:43.073 --> 1:02:45.275
No!

1:02:49.980 --> 1:02:51.882
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1:02:51.915 --> 1:02:53.884
What the fuck are you doing?

1:02:53.917 --> 1:02:55.752
- Why'd you do that?
- He's a dead man.

1:02:55.786 --> 1:02:57.421
His time was wasting away
with him.

1:02:57.454 --> 1:02:59.755
So you just killed him
in cold blood,

1:02:59.789 --> 1:03:01.425
take his minutes
for yourself?

1:03:01.458 --> 1:03:04.293
You want to take my time too?

1:03:04.327 --> 1:03:06.662
I didn't take his time.

1:03:07.330 --> 1:03:08.898
I gave it to you.

1:03:08.931 --> 1:03:12.268
I made sure you were standing
closest to the body.

1:03:15.805 --> 1:03:17.273
Take it.

1:03:18.941 --> 1:03:21.076
Take it.

1:03:21.109 --> 1:03:23.879
It's almost fully loaded.

1:03:23.912 --> 1:03:26.449
Hold on to it, and only use it
if you have to.

1:03:26.482 --> 1:03:28.717
Do not give it to anyone.

1:03:29.985 --> 1:03:32.187
Think about numero uno for once.

1:03:32.220 --> 1:03:34.222
Stand up for yourself.

1:03:38.093 --> 1:03:39.728
You have the most time now.

1:03:41.963 --> 1:03:43.165
And a gun.

1:03:43.198 --> 1:03:45.065
You can survive this.

1:03:45.099 --> 1:03:47.067
I'm not playing this game, Ezra.

1:03:47.101 --> 1:03:48.269
I'm going to find Rian.

1:03:48.302 --> 1:03:49.937
She might be able
to save us all.

1:03:49.970 --> 1:03:51.005
No more bloodshed.

1:03:51.038 --> 1:03:54.074
Just stop with the wallflower
shtick, all right?

1:03:54.108 --> 1:03:55.943
Make your voice heard.

1:03:58.145 --> 1:03:59.414
When the time is right...

1:04:00.948 --> 1:04:03.451
don't be afraid
to make a little noise.

1:04:07.321 --> 1:04:09.956
Where the fuck
are you even going?

1:04:09.989 --> 1:04:12.759
I think I know
who killed Caleb.

1:04:26.139 --> 1:04:27.840
Rian?

1:04:29.242 --> 1:04:31.412
- Ri-Rian. Rian.
- Over here!

1:04:31.445 --> 1:04:33.111
- Rian.
- Oh, babe!

1:04:33.145 --> 1:04:36.014
- Oh, what happened?
- We gotta get out of here, okay?

1:04:36.048 --> 1:04:38.384
- Okay. Where do we go?
- Anywhere. Anywhere is fine.

1:04:38.418 --> 1:04:40.420
- Okay, okay.
- Let's find your dad.

1:04:42.888 --> 1:04:44.323
Kato!

1:04:48.293 --> 1:04:49.962
Wait, where are we?

1:04:49.995 --> 1:04:51.431
I don't know.

1:04:51.464 --> 1:04:53.966
Didn't we just come from...
From here?

1:04:53.999 --> 1:04:56.034
I-I-I don't know.
It all looks the same.

1:04:56.068 --> 1:04:58.135
You said you... okay.

1:04:58.169 --> 1:05:00.871
Okay, let's...

1:05:03.375 --> 1:05:04.875
Oh, shit.

1:05:04.909 --> 1:05:06.545
Hey, Erin.

1:05:06.578 --> 1:05:09.381
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:05:09.414 --> 1:05:12.351
So, spoiler alert.

1:05:12.384 --> 1:05:15.119
Kato and his girlfriend
are psychopaths

1:05:15.152 --> 1:05:17.288
who want everyone dead.

1:05:17.321 --> 1:05:19.424
- Are you?
- No.

1:05:20.924 --> 1:05:22.092
What happened?

1:05:23.461 --> 1:05:25.295
He came after us.

1:05:25.328 --> 1:05:27.431
Went all crazy on PJ.

1:05:27.465 --> 1:05:29.833
Amber tried to kill me too.

1:05:29.866 --> 1:05:31.167
You okay?

1:05:31.201 --> 1:05:32.536
For now. You got more time?

1:05:33.970 --> 1:05:35.238
Yeah, um...

1:05:35.272 --> 1:05:36.407
Did you, like, kill...?

1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:37.575
No, no, of course not.

1:05:37.608 --> 1:05:39.309
Okay. Thank God.

1:05:39.343 --> 1:05:41.379
My dad, we were
tracking his phone,

1:05:41.412 --> 1:05:42.979
but it's dead now.

1:05:43.013 --> 1:05:45.914
We found him, but he wasn't
going to make it.

1:05:45.948 --> 1:05:47.316
What?

1:05:47.350 --> 1:05:49.452
- Wait, what?
- Did-did someone kill him?

1:05:49.486 --> 1:05:51.186
Where's my father, Erin?

1:05:51.220 --> 1:05:54.457
Why-why-why is your dad here?
Why is he playing this game?

1:05:54.491 --> 1:05:57.293
Rian, he was bleeding out.
He was stabbed, Rian.

1:05:57.326 --> 1:05:59.094
- Who stabbed him?
- Ezra.

1:05:59.128 --> 1:06:01.364
- Ezra killed my dad?
- No, Ezra was there with me.

1:06:01.398 --> 1:06:03.098
Peterson did.

1:06:03.132 --> 1:06:05.402
Peterson stabbed him and left
him in the woods to bleed out.

1:06:05.435 --> 1:06:10.038
I was there when he died, Rian.
That's why I got his time.

1:06:10.071 --> 1:06:12.173
I swear, we were trying
to help him.

1:06:12.206 --> 1:06:14.610
I swear.

1:06:14.643 --> 1:06:16.578
But he told us that Peterson
had a detonator

1:06:16.612 --> 1:06:18.146
that controlled this vest.

1:06:18.179 --> 1:06:19.581
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.

1:06:19.615 --> 1:06:21.583
It doesn't work!

1:06:21.617 --> 1:06:23.084
Your dad said he had
another one.

1:06:23.117 --> 1:06:26.588
One that might deactivate them.
Okay?

1:06:26.622 --> 1:06:29.290
- That's good, right?
- Where is it, Erin?

1:06:30.492 --> 1:06:32.025
And I think your dad said

1:06:32.059 --> 1:06:35.228
it's on Peterson's body,
back at the camp.

1:06:35.262 --> 1:06:37.398
Rian, I'm so sorry.

1:06:39.333 --> 1:06:40.601
Ri.

1:06:41.569 --> 1:06:43.070
Ri, we can't give up now.

1:06:44.405 --> 1:06:46.206
We can't.

1:06:46.239 --> 1:06:47.575
I'm sorry.

1:06:47.608 --> 1:06:50.345
It's... it's not giving up, PJ.

1:06:50.378 --> 1:06:52.447
It's called accepting reality.

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:54.615
Maybe you should try
to join me for once

1:06:54.649 --> 1:06:58.150
instead of living
in fantasyland all the time!

1:07:03.222 --> 1:07:04.491
I'm sorry.

1:07:05.392 --> 1:07:07.993
I'm sorry.

1:07:11.698 --> 1:07:13.367
No, it's okay.

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:16.268
It's okay. You're okay.

1:07:16.302 --> 1:07:20.071
Do you want... do you want
to go see your dad?

1:07:20.105 --> 1:07:22.475
No, Rian, please.
You don't.

1:07:26.612 --> 1:07:28.381
Let's figure this out first,
and...

1:07:28.414 --> 1:07:32.083
and then I'll say goodbye
if there's time.

1:07:32.117 --> 1:07:33.251
Yeah, he...

1:07:33.284 --> 1:07:36.955
he'd expect that, you know,
for you to save everybody.

1:07:36.988 --> 1:07:39.458
What's left of us.

1:07:39.492 --> 1:07:41.159
Okay.

1:07:42.227 --> 1:07:43.562
You're not coming with?

1:07:43.596 --> 1:07:45.563
If Kato's gone nuts,
I need to go help Ezra.

1:07:45.597 --> 1:07:47.931
I'll meet you back at camp,
okay?

1:07:47.965 --> 1:07:50.134
- Okay. Be careful, Erin.
- Let's go.

1:07:50.167 --> 1:07:52.704
This place is going to start
sounding like a popcorn machine

1:07:52.737 --> 1:07:54.238
if this doesn't work.

1:07:59.109 --> 1:08:01.513
Fucking show yourself!

1:08:01.546 --> 1:08:03.313
Kato!

1:08:03.348 --> 1:08:05.315
You fucking dickhead!

1:08:05.350 --> 1:08:07.719
I'm coming for you,
you piece of shit.

1:08:07.752 --> 1:08:10.354
I know you always hated Caleb.

1:08:12.689 --> 1:08:14.425
PJ, this way.

1:08:16.593 --> 1:08:19.162
Hold on. Fuck.

1:08:19.195 --> 1:08:20.731
We got to keep moving.

1:08:20.764 --> 1:08:22.666
We're running out of time, PJ.

1:08:22.699 --> 1:08:24.668
- Just give me two seconds.
- Come on.

1:08:24.701 --> 1:08:26.336
You know that I love you, right?

1:08:26.370 --> 1:08:28.037
Oh, I love you, too.

1:08:28.070 --> 1:08:29.640
Okay, I just needed you
to know that.

1:08:29.673 --> 1:08:32.174
There was a time I thought I was
going to live forever,

1:08:32.207 --> 1:08:33.709
and then Caleb died and it was
like,

1:08:33.743 --> 1:08:36.077
I just hope that I outlive
my parents.

1:08:36.111 --> 1:08:39.214
And now... now I'm not even
going to outlive fax machines.

1:08:39.247 --> 1:08:41.417
And, look, I really,
really wanted to do this

1:08:41.451 --> 1:08:42.652
in a better time and place,

1:08:42.685 --> 1:08:44.454
but it's going to be
game over soon,

1:08:44.487 --> 1:08:46.188
so I might as well do it now.

1:08:46.221 --> 1:08:50.258
I can't die without asking you
a very important question.

1:08:50.292 --> 1:08:52.027
No, babe. Not now.

1:08:53.094 --> 1:08:54.497
Let's get out of this,

1:08:54.530 --> 1:08:57.666
and you can do everything
the way you planned, okay?

1:08:57.699 --> 1:09:00.469
Okay. Just, can you please
hold on to this for me,

1:09:00.502 --> 1:09:03.338
so that I don't lose it?

1:09:03.371 --> 1:09:05.340
I will, just because I love it.

1:09:05.373 --> 1:09:07.576
But when everything's
back to normal,

1:09:07.609 --> 1:09:10.612
I want the going down on one
knee thing and everything, okay?

1:09:10.645 --> 1:09:12.313
Yeah.

1:09:12.347 --> 1:09:14.281
PJ...

1:09:14.315 --> 1:09:16.618
- Yeah?
- ...I was wrong.

1:09:16.651 --> 1:09:20.220
My favorite thing about you
is how you dedicate your life

1:09:20.253 --> 1:09:21.689
to what you believe in.

1:09:21.722 --> 1:09:25.158
Your friends, your band, us.

1:09:26.694 --> 1:09:29.095
Don't change.

1:09:29.128 --> 1:09:30.464
Okay.

1:09:30.498 --> 1:09:32.500
Kato!

1:09:35.436 --> 1:09:37.036
Kato!

1:09:39.172 --> 1:09:41.174
'Sup, bro?

1:09:42.376 --> 1:09:44.711
Got something you want to get
off your chest?

1:09:44.744 --> 1:09:46.446
Like that vest?

1:09:46.479 --> 1:09:48.648
Or maybe the fact that you
fucked my girlfriend

1:09:48.681 --> 1:09:50.416
with that bushy
pencil dick of yours.

1:09:50.450 --> 1:09:53.185
- Oh, shit, he knows.
- It's called manscaping, bro.

1:09:53.218 --> 1:09:56.021
Read a "G.Q."
every once in a while.

1:09:56.756 --> 1:09:59.692
I know what you did to Caleb.

1:09:59.726 --> 1:10:02.294
- Fuck this.
- Oh, shit.

1:10:04.096 --> 1:10:06.231
Who gives a fuck about Caleb?

1:10:09.735 --> 1:10:11.570
His dad, for one.

1:10:13.271 --> 1:10:15.273
So that's what this
is all about.

1:10:15.306 --> 1:10:18.477
Peterson thinks one of us killed
Caleb, and you assume it was me!

1:10:18.510 --> 1:10:20.177
If the glove fits.

1:10:20.211 --> 1:10:22.581
You had a hard-on for Erin
back in high school,

1:10:22.614 --> 1:10:24.181
but she was with Caleb.

1:10:24.215 --> 1:10:26.451
I always did like
the quiet ones.

1:10:26.485 --> 1:10:28.085
I wanted to make them scream.

1:10:30.489 --> 1:10:34.492
You brought a metric shit-ton
of ecstasy to that party.

1:10:34.525 --> 1:10:36.661
Then made me swear to not say
anything to the cops

1:10:36.694 --> 1:10:38.396
when they came asking questions.

1:10:42.433 --> 1:10:45.736
You poisoned his drinks,
didn't you?

1:10:45.770 --> 1:10:47.471
That's quite the story, Ez.

1:10:47.505 --> 1:10:48.673
Didn't you?

1:10:54.144 --> 1:10:57.614
How am I supposed to have
a conversation with you

1:10:57.647 --> 1:10:59.181
if you won't...?

1:11:00.483 --> 1:11:04.253
...give me a minute
to spit some words out.

1:11:05.455 --> 1:11:07.591
I'll give you four.

1:11:07.624 --> 1:11:10.225
All right. Caleb, he just...

1:11:13.162 --> 1:11:15.398
You said you'd let me talk.

1:11:15.432 --> 1:11:16.499
I can't help it.

1:11:16.533 --> 1:11:18.501
You've just got
such a punchable face.

1:11:18.535 --> 1:11:22.270
Well, we can't all be vapid
little pretty boys, now can we?

1:11:22.303 --> 1:11:25.173
You think you're better than me?

1:11:27.710 --> 1:11:29.378
Ezra?

1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:33.181
Ezra.

1:11:35.216 --> 1:11:36.685
No.

1:11:36.719 --> 1:11:38.186
Amber?

1:11:38.921 --> 1:11:40.856
Amber, are you okay?

1:11:41.857 --> 1:11:43.791
He made me do it.

1:11:43.825 --> 1:11:47.160
He made me kill
my best friend.

1:11:48.463 --> 1:11:52.834
Look at you, acting all
high-and-fucking-mighty.

1:11:54.402 --> 1:11:56.504
Don't act like you grew
a conscience, Ezra.

1:11:59.607 --> 1:12:02.877
Whether I killed Caleb or not...

1:12:02.910 --> 1:12:04.412
is irrelevant.

1:12:04.445 --> 1:12:05.947
You want my time.

1:12:05.980 --> 1:12:07.582
You're going to kill me no
matter what.

1:12:07.615 --> 1:12:09.916
You're not the hero
of this story, Ezra.

1:12:29.403 --> 1:12:32.371
What choice did I have?

1:12:32.405 --> 1:12:35.273
Peterson made us all do things
we didn't want to do.

1:12:35.306 --> 1:12:38.344
Look, let's go back to camp.
We can figure it out, okay?

1:12:38.377 --> 1:12:40.613
Rian is figuring out a way

1:12:40.646 --> 1:12:42.348
to disarm the vests.

1:12:43.983 --> 1:12:46.385
- Get off me!
- Fuck you!

1:12:48.754 --> 1:12:49.922
Sounds like Erin.

1:12:52.658 --> 1:12:54.326
I have to kill you.

1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:56.828
- I got to go save her.
- What the fuck, PJ? No.

1:12:56.861 --> 1:12:59.497
You don't need me for this.

1:12:59.531 --> 1:13:01.298
You got this, okay?

1:13:01.332 --> 1:13:02.667
What's the point
in surviving tonight

1:13:02.701 --> 1:13:04.502
if none of our friends do, okay?

1:13:04.536 --> 1:13:07.304
She could be dead by the time
that we deactivate these things.

1:13:07.338 --> 1:13:09.441
- No, I got to do this.
- No, babe.

1:13:09.474 --> 1:13:12.577
Take this and stab Kato
in the fucking face

1:13:12.610 --> 1:13:13.845
if he comes near you, okay?

1:13:13.878 --> 1:13:15.245
Be careful.

1:13:15.279 --> 1:13:16.481
You can end this.

1:13:16.514 --> 1:13:19.017
You got this.

1:13:19.050 --> 1:13:21.585
You fucking got this.

1:13:35.733 --> 1:13:37.501
You know what, man?

1:13:38.802 --> 1:13:40.269
Just kill me.

1:13:40.303 --> 1:13:42.372
Just get it over with.

1:13:42.406 --> 1:13:43.673
No.

1:13:43.706 --> 1:13:45.273
Fight back.

1:13:46.576 --> 1:13:47.910
It's fucking weird
killing you

1:13:47.944 --> 1:13:49.412
when you're surrendering.

1:13:51.447 --> 1:13:53.416
Erin?

1:13:58.788 --> 1:14:00.823
Fucking mute!

1:14:04.994 --> 1:14:09.631
Before you kill me,
I just want you to know,

1:14:09.664 --> 1:14:11.032
I didn't kill Caleb.

1:14:11.066 --> 1:14:12.934
I didn't poison his drinks.

1:14:12.968 --> 1:14:16.338
I promise. I swear.

1:14:18.707 --> 1:14:20.307
You bitch.

1:14:20.342 --> 1:14:22.444
From the moment you got back,

1:14:22.477 --> 1:14:25.312
all the punching
notwithstanding,

1:14:25.347 --> 1:14:27.916
I knew something had changed.

1:14:27.949 --> 1:14:30.986
You got weak.

1:14:31.019 --> 1:14:34.588
Usually it takes months,
if not years,

1:14:34.622 --> 1:14:38.626
for a girl to break a guy down
into a spineless,

1:14:38.659 --> 1:14:40.795
emasculated puddle of a man.

1:14:40.828 --> 1:14:47.334
Ah, but five minutes with Erin
and you got soft.

1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:53.974
But I'm not soft.

1:14:56.910 --> 1:15:00.647
I am as hard as a priest
in a playground.

1:15:09.656 --> 1:15:11.024
Erin!

1:15:20.065 --> 1:15:22.367
Oh, my God!

1:15:26.171 --> 1:15:28.073
Come on, Ezra.

1:15:29.641 --> 1:15:31.677
You going to fucking die
or blow up?

1:15:34.746 --> 1:15:36.081
Finally.

1:15:36.114 --> 1:15:37.749
Still the lowest. Fuck!

1:15:39.117 --> 1:15:41.153
Even in death
you're a selfish dickhead.

1:15:41.186 --> 1:15:43.155
Stay back, Amber!
Don't fucking move!

1:15:43.188 --> 1:15:44.555
Drop the fucking knife!

1:15:44.589 --> 1:15:46.057
Seriously? Is this a joke?

1:15:46.090 --> 1:15:47.892
Put the knife down.

1:15:47.925 --> 1:15:50.661
What, you're a fucking hero now?

1:15:57.568 --> 1:15:59.804
Go back to Rian at the camp.
Now, run.

1:15:59.837 --> 1:16:02.073
Yeah, run, you bitch!

1:16:02.106 --> 1:16:04.542
What, are you going to shoot me,
loser?

1:16:04.575 --> 1:16:06.177
Come on, just fucking do it.

1:16:06.210 --> 1:16:08.011
- Don't fucking make me.
- Fucking do it!

1:16:08.044 --> 1:16:10.080
Don't fucking make me.

1:16:10.113 --> 1:16:11.915
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

1:16:14.517 --> 1:16:15.652
Fuck.

1:16:18.855 --> 1:16:21.424
Come on, you loser.
What are you waiting for?

1:16:21.458 --> 1:16:24.594
You don't know how to shoot
a fucking gun, idiot?

1:16:24.628 --> 1:16:25.962
Kato.

1:16:25.996 --> 1:16:27.597
Guys, look, we think
we found a way

1:16:27.631 --> 1:16:29.532
that we can all
win this thing, okay?

1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:31.867
We can all win, Kato.

1:16:33.869 --> 1:16:35.871
Come on, man.
Rian's back at the camp now.

1:16:35.905 --> 1:16:38.707
We think we found a remote
that can deactivate all of us.

1:16:38.741 --> 1:16:41.543
All right? I need you guys
to come with me.

1:16:41.577 --> 1:16:43.846
Come with me back to camp.
Please.

1:16:43.879 --> 1:16:45.581
I don't want to shoot you, bro.

1:16:45.614 --> 1:16:47.616
I really, really don't want
to shoot you, man.

1:16:47.650 --> 1:16:49.084
Just, please,
you got to trust me.

1:16:49.118 --> 1:16:50.452
You're my friend.

1:16:50.486 --> 1:16:51.887
It's Rian, she can save us.

1:16:51.921 --> 1:16:53.689
How sure is she?

1:16:53.722 --> 1:16:54.857
I don't know, bro.

1:16:54.890 --> 1:16:57.091
It's fucking Rian,
she knows this shit.

1:16:57.125 --> 1:16:58.593
What are the odds?

1:16:58.626 --> 1:17:00.595
Ninety-nine, ninety-nine
percent.

1:17:00.628 --> 1:17:02.597
Ninety-nine?

1:17:02.630 --> 1:17:04.599
Come on, Kato.

1:17:04.632 --> 1:17:05.767
Not good enough.

1:17:07.502 --> 1:17:08.636
Kato!

1:17:08.670 --> 1:17:11.806
Kato, get off...
Son of a bitch, Kato!

1:17:13.007 --> 1:17:15.143
Kato!

1:17:15.176 --> 1:17:16.911
Stop right now! Stop!

1:17:21.214 --> 1:17:22.816
You're like a brother to me,
man.

1:17:22.849 --> 1:17:24.151
Why are you doing this?

1:17:24.184 --> 1:17:25.686
Oh, what am I doing?

1:17:26.987 --> 1:17:29.523
What am I doing?

1:17:29.556 --> 1:17:30.524
Kato.

1:17:30.557 --> 1:17:32.225
No! Oh, you're right, PJ.

1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:34.928
Oh, you're right.

1:17:34.962 --> 1:17:36.997
I'm so sorry.

1:17:37.030 --> 1:17:39.066
It's okay.

1:17:39.933 --> 1:17:41.201
It's okay, man.

1:17:42.202 --> 1:17:44.070
Let's go back to camp.

1:17:45.137 --> 1:17:48.774
Yeah. I'd like that.

1:17:48.808 --> 1:17:50.476
Kato!

1:17:58.150 --> 1:18:00.653
Fuck yes, babe!

1:18:00.686 --> 1:18:02.888
We're going to win this.

1:18:06.092 --> 1:18:07.625
That's more like it.

1:18:11.330 --> 1:18:13.665
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1:18:18.970 --> 1:18:22.841
Erin's meeting Rian at the camp.

1:18:22.874 --> 1:18:25.643
They won't be able to stop us,
babe.

1:18:30.081 --> 1:18:31.749
What are you doing?

1:18:31.782 --> 1:18:33.550
- You know...
- Kato?

1:18:33.584 --> 1:18:34.885
...I've been meaning
to talk to you

1:18:34.918 --> 1:18:37.921
about that whole
"you fucking Ezra" thing.

1:18:39.123 --> 1:18:41.558
Now seems as good a time as any.

1:18:41.592 --> 1:18:43.260
What the fuck are you doing?

1:18:43.293 --> 1:18:44.862
Whatever I have to.

1:18:44.895 --> 1:18:46.897
I tried to help you,
you fucking freak!

1:19:09.652 --> 1:19:11.821
Help! Somebody help.

1:19:28.003 --> 1:19:29.871
Thanks for the good time...

1:19:31.740 --> 1:19:32.841
slut.

1:20:07.707 --> 1:20:08.842
Oh. Oh.

1:20:08.875 --> 1:20:11.244
Oh, come on,
come on, come on.

1:20:15.181 --> 1:20:17.717
Please work.

1:20:19.285 --> 1:20:22.323
Please work.

1:20:26.292 --> 1:20:27.794
Hey.

1:20:29.262 --> 1:20:31.697
No fair.

1:20:37.403 --> 1:20:39.372
No, no, Fuck, no!

1:20:41.874 --> 1:20:43.108
Oh, shit.

1:20:48.013 --> 1:20:49.848
Oh, you son of a bitch.

1:20:57.356 --> 1:20:59.290
Erin, are you okay?
What's going on?

1:20:59.324 --> 1:21:01.993
- We're both red.
- What the fuck?

1:21:02.026 --> 1:21:03.294
PJ didn't find you?

1:21:03.328 --> 1:21:04.829
Where's PJ?

1:21:04.862 --> 1:21:06.431
He's with Amber.
He's got a gun.

1:21:06.465 --> 1:21:08.132
He told me to come back for you.

1:21:08.166 --> 1:21:10.801
- Did you find the remote?
- Yeah, but it didn't work.

1:21:10.835 --> 1:21:13.704
I think everyone's timer
has been reset

1:21:13.738 --> 1:21:16.007
to the lowest score
on the board: mine.

1:21:16.040 --> 1:21:18.042
It was a trick.
Peterson thought of everything.

1:21:18.075 --> 1:21:20.877
- No, you can try again.
- No. We can all die right now.

1:21:20.911 --> 1:21:22.078
I'm sorry.

1:21:23.314 --> 1:21:25.383
We have to go back for PJ.

1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:31.855
Oh, shit.

1:21:34.458 --> 1:21:35.825
Where's PJ?

1:21:35.859 --> 1:21:37.194
I hope you weren't expecting

1:21:37.227 --> 1:21:38.362
any more mixtapes.

1:21:38.396 --> 1:21:39.930
Because PJ got a bad case

1:21:39.963 --> 1:21:41.298
of a bullet
through the skull.

1:21:43.199 --> 1:21:47.236
Surprisingly, more brains
came out than you'd think.

1:21:48.971 --> 1:21:52.475
And I hope you weren't expecting
to fuck Ezra,

1:21:52.509 --> 1:21:54.210
because he's dead too.

1:21:56.011 --> 1:21:58.013
Does anybody have
an aspirin?

1:21:58.047 --> 1:21:59.449
You fucking asshole.

1:21:59.482 --> 1:22:01.518
Sorry, what's that, Erin?

1:22:01.551 --> 1:22:03.919
You fucking asshole!

1:22:05.455 --> 1:22:07.022
There it is.

1:22:07.056 --> 1:22:09.491
You know, I always wanted
to make you scream.

1:22:09.525 --> 1:22:12.328
You're enjoying this
a little too much, Kato.

1:22:12.361 --> 1:22:14.229
Peterson made the rules.

1:22:14.262 --> 1:22:16.965
He didn't say we had
to feel bad about it.

1:22:16.998 --> 1:22:20.268
He was going to propose,
you fucking psycho!

1:22:20.302 --> 1:22:22.371
Who, PJ?

1:22:22.404 --> 1:22:24.138
At a football game?

1:22:24.172 --> 1:22:25.341
How did you think both of you

1:22:25.374 --> 1:22:27.008
were going to get out
of here alive?

1:22:27.041 --> 1:22:29.210
You would have made
some fucking stupid kids.

1:22:29.244 --> 1:22:32.380
- You want to see the ring, huh?
- No, not really.

1:22:34.382 --> 1:22:37.017
Look at it,
you piece of shit!

1:22:37.050 --> 1:22:37.884
Look at it!

1:22:37.918 --> 1:22:39.520
That's all right
for a man of his income.

1:22:39.554 --> 1:22:41.522
What's three months' salary

1:22:41.556 --> 1:22:42.990
for a guy who makes
zero dollars?

1:22:43.023 --> 1:22:45.460
Fuck you, Kato!

1:22:53.434 --> 1:22:55.002
Come on, Erin!

1:22:55.034 --> 1:22:56.436
We're running out of time!

1:22:59.473 --> 1:23:01.475
Hurry up, Erin!

1:23:02.542 --> 1:23:04.378
Rian, wait! Please!

1:23:04.411 --> 1:23:05.512
Please.

1:23:19.090 --> 1:23:20.292
Help me.

1:23:20.326 --> 1:23:21.793
Here.

1:23:24.129 --> 1:23:27.799
Come on. Haven't got all day.

1:23:28.900 --> 1:23:31.570
Here, Rian, give it back.

1:23:32.505 --> 1:23:34.105
What are you doing?

1:23:34.139 --> 1:23:37.976
Even if Kato's completely
out of the picture...

1:23:39.978 --> 1:23:42.481
there's not enough time
to change the rules now.

1:23:42.515 --> 1:23:44.048
What are you doing?

1:23:45.583 --> 1:23:48.218
Where the fuck are you two?

1:23:48.252 --> 1:23:50.187
Only one of us can survive.

1:23:50.220 --> 1:23:52.156
Wait, what the fuck
are you doing?

1:23:53.924 --> 1:23:55.159
I was wondering how you got

1:23:55.192 --> 1:23:57.027
all that extra time
on your vest, Erin.

1:23:57.061 --> 1:23:58.962
Rian, please, I can explain.
Don't do this.

1:23:58.996 --> 1:24:02.300
You have this, his gun,
and you told me he just died?

1:24:05.503 --> 1:24:07.571
Did you kill my dad, Erin?

1:24:07.604 --> 1:24:09.105
Rian, I swear it wasn't me.

1:24:09.138 --> 1:24:11.174
I was there when he died.
He was bleeding out.

1:24:11.207 --> 1:24:14.210
- Ezra was trying...
- Put him out of his misery? Huh?

1:24:14.243 --> 1:24:16.279
He knew your dad
wasn't going to make it.

1:24:16.313 --> 1:24:18.014
By giving me the extra time,

1:24:18.047 --> 1:24:21.184
it was one friend that didn't
have to kill someone else.

1:24:22.553 --> 1:24:25.221
I'm going to find you.

1:24:26.423 --> 1:24:27.924
I'm sorry.

1:24:27.957 --> 1:24:29.892
This whole thing's my fault.

1:24:33.095 --> 1:24:34.297
How?

1:24:34.330 --> 1:24:36.064
I introduced you all to Caleb.

1:24:36.098 --> 1:24:38.233
I brought him
into the circle.

1:24:50.245 --> 1:24:51.581
It was me, Erin.

1:24:52.682 --> 1:24:54.317
What?

1:24:54.350 --> 1:24:56.183
What the fuck's going on?

1:25:01.255 --> 1:25:04.024
I killed Caleb.

1:25:05.259 --> 1:25:06.661
What?

1:25:07.662 --> 1:25:09.564
He was trending
towards a G.P.A.

1:25:09.598 --> 1:25:11.400
higher than mine, and...

1:25:11.433 --> 1:25:12.567
No.

1:25:14.135 --> 1:25:15.102
Oh, please.

1:25:15.136 --> 1:25:18.673
And I wanted to be valedictorian
at all costs.

1:25:22.309 --> 1:25:24.645
I-I needed the scholarship.

1:25:24.678 --> 1:25:28.716
M.I.T. on a cop's salary
not going to work.

1:25:28.749 --> 1:25:31.151
Everyone was taking speed
at Ezra's party,

1:25:31.184 --> 1:25:34.655
and I got my hands
on Kato's stash, and...

1:25:34.688 --> 1:25:36.690
I never meant to kill him.

1:25:36.724 --> 1:25:38.592
I just wanted enough
in his system

1:25:38.626 --> 1:25:40.126
to show up on a drug test,

1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:43.262
get him disqualified
from being valedictorian.

1:25:43.296 --> 1:25:47.032
But I fucked up some
metric-to-imperial conversion,

1:25:47.065 --> 1:25:49.669
wound up giving him
way too much.

1:25:49.702 --> 1:25:53.138
I made a really stupid mistake,
and Caleb died.

1:25:53.172 --> 1:25:54.273
No.

1:25:57.009 --> 1:25:59.312
What are you doing?

1:25:59.345 --> 1:26:02.147
I let people cover it up.
I let my dad cover it up.

1:26:02.181 --> 1:26:04.049
It wasn't hard to sell him
on the idea

1:26:04.082 --> 1:26:06.319
that Caleb's death
was an accident.

1:26:09.187 --> 1:26:11.590
And I will never
forgive myself.

1:26:15.494 --> 1:26:19.063
I've had to live with that,
no one else knowing.

1:26:23.368 --> 1:26:25.637
But I don't have
to live with it anymore.

1:26:27.773 --> 1:26:31.342
You deserve to walk out of here
more than anyone.

1:26:33.043 --> 1:26:35.278
You definitely deserve it
more than me.

1:26:35.313 --> 1:26:37.782
Take this and do
what you need to do, Erin.

1:26:37.815 --> 1:26:39.450
Don't say that.

1:26:39.484 --> 1:26:41.251
Take it.

1:26:41.284 --> 1:26:43.019
All right.

1:26:43.754 --> 1:26:45.356
Found you!

1:26:52.730 --> 1:26:54.765
Yeah! Fuck, yes.

1:26:57.467 --> 1:27:00.102
I'm getting fucking
good at this.

1:27:00.135 --> 1:27:01.605
Turning into John Wick.

1:27:05.709 --> 1:27:07.711
Oh, yes!

1:27:07.744 --> 1:27:09.513
Yes. No.

1:27:09.546 --> 1:27:10.780
That's my kill.

1:27:10.814 --> 1:27:13.817
You stay away from her,
you time-stealing bitch!

1:27:13.850 --> 1:27:16.653
Fuck you! Fuck you.

1:27:18.421 --> 1:27:20.289
Well, you may have
more time than me,

1:27:20.322 --> 1:27:22.725
but you know you've only got
seconds left to live, right?

1:27:22.758 --> 1:27:24.393
You don't have the balls
to play this game

1:27:24.426 --> 1:27:26.662
the way it's meant
to be played.

1:27:26.695 --> 1:27:29.331
Do you, Erin?
You charity case.

1:27:29.365 --> 1:27:31.600
Fucking poor person!

1:27:31.634 --> 1:27:35.136
Don't point that gun at me
like you're going to use it.

1:27:35.169 --> 1:27:37.272
We both know you can't
pull that trigger.

1:27:37.306 --> 1:27:38.707
You basic bitch!

1:27:38.741 --> 1:27:41.777
Do it. Do it.
Pull the trigger, skank.

1:27:41.810 --> 1:27:43.511
If it wasn't me tonight,

1:27:43.545 --> 1:27:47.782
it would've been some other guy
some other time, guaranteed.

1:27:47.815 --> 1:27:50.418
Why are we even talking?

1:27:50.451 --> 1:27:51.653
You won't kill me.

1:27:51.686 --> 1:27:53.321
You're a left swipe on Tinder.

1:27:53.354 --> 1:27:56.691
You're a forgettable mute coward
who can't kill shit.

1:27:56.724 --> 1:27:59.159
I don't have to kill you.

1:27:59.192 --> 1:28:00.828
I've just got to outlast you.

1:28:12.806 --> 1:28:14.140
Get back here!

1:28:14.173 --> 1:28:16.410
Erin, you come back here now!

1:28:16.443 --> 1:28:19.178
This is still killing someone
in cold blood!

1:28:19.211 --> 1:28:21.682
You're a fucking murderer!

1:28:21.715 --> 1:28:23.750
Fucking femme fatale!

1:28:23.784 --> 1:28:25.852
I killed people!

1:28:25.886 --> 1:28:29.556
I put an ax through
my girlfriend's skull.

1:28:36.261 --> 1:28:39.632
I earned the win tonight,
not you.

1:28:44.370 --> 1:28:46.339
Oh, fuck.

1:28:46.372 --> 1:28:47.707
Fuck.

1:28:47.740 --> 1:28:50.141
Fuck this.

1:28:50.175 --> 1:28:52.243
I'm going out
on my own terms.

1:29:25.342 --> 1:29:26.477
Fuck.

1:29:32.650 --> 1:29:35.386
No! No.

1:29:38.455 --> 1:29:39.823
Oh, no!

1:29:58.508 --> 1:30:00.275
Please, help.

1:30:00.309 --> 1:30:01.844
Somebody help me!

1:30:14.890 --> 1:30:17.258
Help me, please.

1:30:21.663 --> 1:30:22.864
Help me, sir, please.

1:30:22.898 --> 1:30:24.231
Please, help me.

1:30:24.265 --> 1:30:25.934
All my friends have been killed.

1:30:25.967 --> 1:30:27.436
Fuck that.

1:30:33.441 --> 1:30:36.844
Grow a pair,
you fucking coward.

1:30:36.877 --> 1:30:38.679
You fucking fuck!

1:30:38.713 --> 1:30:40.381
Fuck you!
