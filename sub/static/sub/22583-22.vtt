WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:02.390
Previously on Enterprise.

00:02.530 --> 00:04.130
We're 400 years in the future.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.010
You know about the alien we found...

00:06.010 --> 00:07.130
the test subject?

00:07.300 --> 00:09.590
He belongs to the same race
that built the Spheres.

00:09.590 --> 00:12.640
They're altering this space
to make it habitable for their species.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.400
You have to make the Xindi understand
that humanity isn't the enemy.

00:15.510 --> 00:17.460
The weapon won't be launched for several days.

00:17.460 --> 00:19.350
Show us your proof.

00:20.050 --> 00:23.290
You're saying the Expanse will
no longer be compatible for us.

00:23.570 --> 00:24.430
For any of us.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.740
We're destined to form an alliance to stop them.

00:27.350 --> 00:29.030
You need to speak to the Council.

00:29.030 --> 00:32.960
With the evidence you've shown me,
they'll have no choice but to take us seriously.

00:33.430 --> 00:38.900
If it weren't for my assistance,
your species would be facing destruction.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.150
Is it true your species built the Spheres?

00:41.470 --> 00:42.870
Where is Degra?

00:42.940 --> 00:44.250
What kind of weapons do you have?

00:44.250 --> 00:47.580
You expect me to attack a Reptilian warship?

00:50.260 --> 00:51.940
The Reptilian ship has been destroyed.

00:51.940 --> 00:55.880
They would have contacted the Council
and exposed our alliance.

00:55.940 --> 00:58.730
He'll be killed the moment he steps
into the Council chamber.

00:58.730 --> 01:01.310
If Archer is telling the truth,...

01:01.820 --> 01:05.900
then all the Council's efforts will be for nothing.

01:07.710 --> 01:09.170
We've been successful.

01:09.170 --> 01:12.060
The Xindi weapon is days away from completion.

01:12.060 --> 01:14.570
The timelines don't support that assessment.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.260
What have you seen?

01:16.270 --> 01:19.970
The number of lines with favorable outcomes has diminished.

01:19.970 --> 01:22.750
There is now an increased chance that the Earth ship...

01:22.750 --> 01:25.490
will prevent the weapon from being launched.

01:25.490 --> 01:27.230
Not necessarily.

01:27.230 --> 01:28.690
Timelines are sensitive.

01:28.690 --> 01:31.030
They're prone to temporary fluctuations.

01:31.030 --> 01:32.500
This is no fluctuation.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.790
This is a trajectory away from
our desired outcome.

01:35.790 --> 01:38.620
See that you take definitive actions
to correct this.

01:38.620 --> 01:42.520
The weapon must be launched.
Earth must be destroyed.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

03:11.350 --> 03:13.650
I'm not detecting any trellium in your system.

03:14.580 --> 03:15.820
How are you feeling?

03:16.980 --> 03:19.480
The emotions are still difficult to control.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.420
Meditation isn't helping?

03:21.420 --> 03:24.420
Somewhat.
But I'm still experiencing frequent...

03:26.080 --> 03:27.420
You okay?

03:27.890 --> 03:29.270
Just a mild headache.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.270
I thought Vulcans didn't get headaches.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.660
I'm needed in the command center.

03:38.390 --> 03:40.970
You ever see anything strange
about the way she's acting?

03:42.280 --> 03:45.660
There isn't anyone on the ship
who hasn't been affected by recent events.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.960
What can I do for you?

03:47.960 --> 03:50.340
I think I pulled a muscle.

03:51.620 --> 03:52.770
Pain's pretty bad.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.920
Have a seat.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.920
We've been running double shifts in engineering.

03:57.090 --> 04:00.000
Captain's in a hell of a rush to get
to this damn Council.

04:00.870 --> 04:04.270
He believes he can get
the Xindi to reconsider their attack on Earth.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.980
We owe him a little faith.

04:06.220 --> 04:07.560
Oh, I have faith in the captain.

04:08.180 --> 04:10.270
But not in the people he's trying to convince.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.490
Degra seems to be a reasonable man.

04:12.830 --> 04:13.640
Reasonable?

04:14.690 --> 04:17.820
I don't think many people back
in my hometown would go along with that.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.600
Thanks, Doc.

04:30.130 --> 04:34.120
The Spheres are controlled
by a network of artificial intelligence.

04:34.770 --> 04:37.120
This section houses the redundant memory core.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.530
It should contain a significant amount of information.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.380
We're hoping that'll include data
on the Sphere-Builders.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.720
That could help us with the Council.

04:46.140 --> 04:49.310
Our present course will take us close
to another Sphere.

04:49.610 --> 04:51.520
I'm sending a crew in a shuttlepod.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.010
They'll join up with us later.

04:53.170 --> 04:55.140
How do you plan to get inside it?

04:56.220 --> 04:58.450
We're pretty sure we've found a way in.

05:00.130 --> 05:03.780
You've mentioned the Xindi have been studying
the Spheres for decades.

05:04.660 --> 05:09.140
We're interested in any information you have
on the construction of their outer shells.

05:09.210 --> 05:11.540
I'll send over whatever's in my database.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.940
Sir?

05:17.010 --> 05:19.410
I've been reviewing service transcripts.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.900
You've got over a thousand hours in an EV suit.

05:21.950 --> 05:24.080
I did six months on the Janus loop.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.730
Are you interested in running this mission with us?

05:27.030 --> 05:29.040
I'm always ready to stretch my legs, sir.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.690
Get prepped.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.280
Uh, the Janus...

05:33.280 --> 05:36.650
-That includes EV combat training?
- Yes, sir.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.320
Are we expecting a firefight?

05:40.160 --> 05:41.910
Don't know what to expect.

05:51.590 --> 05:54.910
When it's finished compiling, send it to Enterprise.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.140
It's not too late.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.270
Dismissed.

06:07.260 --> 06:09.210
Dismissed!

06:18.160 --> 06:22.030
Not everyone has forgotten what
we've done for your people.

06:22.350 --> 06:23.570
What do you want?

06:24.120 --> 06:26.570
You've turned away from us.

06:28.570 --> 06:29.570
Come back.

06:30.920 --> 06:31.890
I can't.

06:32.090 --> 06:33.430
I hear it in your voice.

06:33.430 --> 06:38.420
You've betrayed everything you believe in,
and now you're in turmoil.

06:38.630 --> 06:40.700
I don't regret what I'm doing.

06:40.770 --> 06:47.110
At one time or another, you must have asked yourself
why we've protected the Xindi for so long.

06:47.870 --> 06:49.610
Many of us have wondered that.

06:49.730 --> 06:54.490
It's because we can see a future
where the Xindi are no longer fragmented.

06:54.810 --> 06:58.620
No longer struggling for existence.

07:00.530 --> 07:06.170
You are destined to become a great civilization, ...

07:06.670 --> 07:09.850
and now it's all in jeopardy ...

07:10.830 --> 07:12.850
because of you.

07:14.270 --> 07:15.110
No.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.930
You created a device that will prevent
a devastating attack.

07:18.980 --> 07:25.490
Your name was to be spoken with reverence
for generations to come.

07:26.730 --> 07:28.840
And, instead,

07:29.240 --> 07:31.840
you've chosen the role of betrayer.

07:33.140 --> 07:36.820
How I'm remembered isn't for you to decide.

07:38.340 --> 07:41.360
What have we done to lose your faith?

07:43.770 --> 07:47.650
You never deserved my faith.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.020
The Sphere-Builders have lied to the Xindi.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.020
They've manipulated us for decades.
I see that.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.140
Perhaps the Arboreals will, but the others...

08:05.140 --> 08:07.830
We have the evidence to back it up.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.870
The evidence may not be enough.

08:11.870 --> 08:15.960
The Sphere-Builders saved the Xindi from extinction.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.960
When our homeworld was destroyed, ...

08:19.470 --> 08:21.400
they began appearing to the survivors.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.350
They'd guide them to habitable planets.

08:23.350 --> 08:26.230
Show them the location of valuable resources.

08:26.230 --> 08:28.220
They're practically worshipped.

08:28.330 --> 08:30.910
We call them "The Guardians."

08:32.010 --> 08:34.530
It's no wonder you had a hard time accepting this.

08:34.530 --> 08:37.309
I was brought up to revere them.

08:37.960 --> 08:42.190
I taught my own children to give thanks
to them at the end of each day.

08:42.190 --> 08:45.190
That is what we're facing.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.760
I've stood before a Klingon tribunal.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.440
I can handle a tough room.

08:50.520 --> 08:54.040
Klingons weren't determined to destroy your world.

08:54.810 --> 08:56.490
But the evidence is strong.

08:56.490 --> 08:58.640
Perhaps it will be enough.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.680
We'll face the Council together.

09:03.860 --> 09:05.900
I may take my seat at the Council table,...

09:05.900 --> 09:10.080
but I'll be at your side no matter what happens.

09:10.930 --> 09:12.940
Bridge to Captain Archer.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.260
Go ahead.

09:15.260 --> 09:17.350
We've picked up several Xindi vessels.

09:17.350 --> 09:19.060
They're closing on our position.

09:19.060 --> 09:21.720
Humanoids, Arboreals and Aquatics-- they're with us.

09:21.940 --> 09:25.120
When we reach the Council's location,
we'll need their protection.

09:25.430 --> 09:27.680
Certain members have more influence than others.

09:27.690 --> 09:30.510
Anything you can tell me about them?
I need to know what I'm up against.

09:30.580 --> 09:32.630
You know Jannar, the Arboreal.

09:32.630 --> 09:34.410
He's fair-minded; a scientist.

09:34.410 --> 09:37.050
He'll listen to the facts.
I count him as a friend.

09:38.410 --> 09:41.170
Unfortunately, the other members are
somewhat more complicated.

09:41.590 --> 09:43.490
The Aquatics, for instance.

09:43.490 --> 09:46.240
Kiaphet Amman'sor is a member of the Ibix dynasty...

09:46.240 --> 09:48.340
a very wealthy, very powerful family.

09:48.340 --> 09:51.770
Her opinions carry considerable weight
when she arrives at them.

09:51.770 --> 09:52.640
There's a saying:

09:52.740 --> 09:57.290
"It's easier to count the stars in the sky
than it is for an Aquatic to reach a decision."

09:57.370 --> 10:01.390
As for the Insectoids, well,
their names grow longer the older they get, ...

10:01.390 --> 10:04.210
so they become a little difficult to pronounce.

10:04.210 --> 10:07.710
In many ways, the Insectoids are
the opposite of the Aquatics.

10:07.710 --> 10:09.190
They're quick to take sides.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.600
We've run into them.

10:10.600 --> 10:14.430
Which brings us to the Reptilians,
and Commander Dolum.

10:14.430 --> 10:15.920
There's a story about him.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.920
I don't know that it's true,
but I'd like to believe it isn't.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.310
His daughter gave birth to a son.

10:21.550 --> 10:24.550
He had a deformity in his right arm.
Not life-threatening, but ...

10:24.760 --> 10:27.550
enough to preclude his ever joining the military.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.710
Commander Dolum had his own grandson poisoned.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.000
>From what I've seen, that's not hard to believe.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.260
As I said, it may be just a story.

10:40.490 --> 10:42.620
But, as a father, ...

10:42.810 --> 10:47.010
it's always in the back of my mind
whenever I have dealings with him.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.340
Enter.

10:55.340 --> 10:57.830
-What is it?
- We've located debris.

10:57.830 --> 11:00.230
It's from the ship we sent to find Degra.

11:00.610 --> 11:03.120
-Where?
- Seven light years from here, ...

11:03.120 --> 11:05.690
within the cloaking barrier of a Sphere.

11:07.360 --> 11:11.300
I want to know how it was destroyed.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.880
Begin an analysis.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.150
It's underway.

11:14.150 --> 11:17.280
Preliminary findings suggest they were attacked.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.300
Yes?

11:18.300 --> 11:20.420
Commander, there are six vessels approaching.

11:20.420 --> 11:21.770
One is the Earth ship.

11:30.270 --> 11:32.630
Contact the lead ship.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.950
This is Degra.

11:35.350 --> 11:36.700
Degra.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.660
I was just thinking of you.

11:39.140 --> 11:41.500
How many prisoners have you taken?

11:41.500 --> 11:44.220
We're escorting Enterprise to the Council.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.940
For what purpose?

11:45.940 --> 11:48.650
Power down your weapons and withdraw.

11:49.280 --> 11:53.610
What makes you think I would let you
bring an enemy ship into a security zone?

11:53.610 --> 11:55.660
Power down your weapons-- now.

11:55.660 --> 11:57.650
I don't take orders from you!

12:00.990 --> 12:02.160
They've launched a torpedo.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.680
What?!

12:04.530 --> 12:06.150
300 meters off the port bow.

12:06.150 --> 12:08.390
You would fire on a Xindi vessel?

12:08.390 --> 12:12.090
We're prepared to destroy your vessel if necessary.

12:12.230 --> 12:13.170
They're locking weapons.

12:13.390 --> 12:14.950
Prepare to return fire!

12:15.020 --> 12:16.710
You're outnumbered and outgunned.

12:16.710 --> 12:20.980
There's no need for this.
I assure you, the Earth ship poses no danger.

12:22.280 --> 12:25.710
I'll see you in the Council chamber.

12:25.710 --> 12:27.620
I look forward to it.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.770
Five seconds.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.100
Three.

12:35.460 --> 12:36.420
Two.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.120
RCS inverter.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.650
Shut it down.

12:50.740 --> 12:51.660
Damage?

12:51.660 --> 12:53.210
Nothing we need to worry about, sir.

12:53.210 --> 12:54.230
Adjust heading.

12:54.230 --> 12:56.560
026 mark 3

13:06.410 --> 13:09.250
I'd breathe a whole lot easier if
you had a couple of MACOs watching your back.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.570
Don't worry.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.020
Keep my chair warm.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.220
Good luck.

13:17.610 --> 13:21.140
-How's your Insectoid these days?
- That depends on which dialect.

13:21.140 --> 13:22.530
There are 67.

13:22.530 --> 13:23.430
Is that all?

13:31.850 --> 13:34.130
Aquatics respect boldness and confidence.

13:34.130 --> 13:36.690
They view hushed tones with suspicion.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.210
I'll make sure I project.

13:38.310 --> 13:40.330
Not too loudly. The Insectoids...

13:40.330 --> 13:42.850
interpret raised voices as a sign of hostility.

13:43.070 --> 13:47.180
When Aquatics use the past tense,
they switch to sonar.

13:47.180 --> 13:49.660
We should see it in a moment.

13:50.950 --> 13:52.250
We're still two kilometers up.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.210
The only way in is from the air.

13:54.250 --> 13:58.480
These cloud layers are present throughout the year.
It's perfectly concealed.

14:00.310 --> 14:01.480
Avians.

14:02.220 --> 14:03.900
Oh, it's beautiful.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.990
The sixth Xindi race.

14:05.990 --> 14:09.200
This was built centuries before
they became extinct.

14:09.460 --> 14:13.780
According to our archaeologists,
it's over 4,000 years old.

14:28.970 --> 14:31.320
Kinda feels like being called to the principal's office.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.430
I was never called to the principal's office.

14:33.430 --> 14:34.960
I was once.

14:35.090 --> 14:36.720
Move aside.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.800
What for?

14:43.580 --> 14:45.090
When we're done here.

15:01.970 --> 15:05.710
You've brought humans into this chamber, Degra.

15:06.270 --> 15:07.940
Explain yourself, ...

15:08.120 --> 15:12.500
if you expect them to leave here alive.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.510
I'm fully prepared to explain my actions.

15:17.710 --> 15:19.430
There's no cause for threats.

15:19.430 --> 15:20.670
Agreed.

15:21.130 --> 15:23.260
We've reviewed the data you've sent.

15:23.710 --> 15:26.590
We are prepared to listen to what you have to say.

15:39.650 --> 15:42.020
You killed seven million of my people.

15:43.850 --> 15:45.780
I want to be honest with you.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.330
I don't much like standing here.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.330
We did what we felt was necessary.

15:52.330 --> 15:53.920
I know.

15:54.640 --> 15:59.160
You've been told that at some time in the future,
my world is going to destroy yours.

16:01.700 --> 16:02.670
That's a lie.

16:05.460 --> 16:07.460
He said, "The Guardians have never lied to us."

16:08.830 --> 16:11.420
The Guardians built the Spheres.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.480
They're reconfiguring the Expanse,
preparing it for colonization.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.770
You reek of desperation.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.120
You would say anything to save your world--

16:21.120 --> 16:24.330
as evidenced by this manufactured data.

16:24.330 --> 16:25.880
It's the truth!

16:26.250 --> 16:27.530
The data is accurate.

16:27.650 --> 16:30.930
Anyone with an objective eye will come
to the same conclusion.

16:30.930 --> 16:34.050
You have no idea what the truth is.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.040
Your sympathy for these....

16:36.120 --> 16:38.540
humans has corrupted your judgment.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.370
My judgment is perfectly sound.

16:41.370 --> 16:45.630
Were you using sound judgment
when you attacked my ship?!

16:45.630 --> 16:48.470
You were trying to prevent us
from reaching this Council.

16:48.470 --> 16:51.470
I was protecting this Council!

16:55.390 --> 16:56.600
"This is not relevant.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.130
-We're here to discuss the human's claims."
- Agreed.

16:59.290 --> 17:02.140
We need to return to the subject at hand.

17:06.890 --> 17:09.369
I am trying to save my world.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.069
But it's not just Earth that's in danger.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.069
If you wipe out mankind,...

17:17.319 --> 17:18.670
you'll be destroying yourselves.

17:18.670 --> 17:21.329
I refuse to listen to any more of this!

17:21.329 --> 17:24.329
Earth is going to lead a battle
that defeats the Sphere-Builders.

17:24.329 --> 17:25.710
They know this.

17:25.770 --> 17:28.099
That's why they manipulated you into attacking us.

17:28.099 --> 17:29.390
Enough!

17:33.130 --> 17:36.010
I demand the immediate seizure of the Earth ship.

17:36.010 --> 17:38.360
Any vessel that attacks Enterprise...

17:38.390 --> 17:42.860
-will be fired upon.
-You will not defy this Council.

17:42.860 --> 17:44.680
We haven't arrived at a decision, yet.

17:44.680 --> 17:50.180
And we never will
as long as we listen to this human's lies.

17:50.560 --> 17:54.280
If this Council will not defend its people, ...

17:55.160 --> 17:58.190
then it has no reason to exist.

18:00.830 --> 18:01.890
Wait!

18:11.270 --> 18:13.180
You don't want to know.

18:19.530 --> 18:21.770
Hold this position.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.900
The exhaust vent.

18:24.110 --> 18:26.030
-Where?
- Set a course.

18:26.030 --> 18:28.460
031 mark 4.

18:29.430 --> 18:31.310
I don't see an exhaust vent.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.030
-You sure about this?
-Half thrusters.

18:48.950 --> 18:49.890
T'Pol.

18:49.890 --> 18:51.260
Hold your course.

18:53.430 --> 18:56.230
-I'm telling you!
-Hold your course.

19:01.590 --> 19:03.500
Some kind of hologram?

19:03.500 --> 19:04.790
Exactly.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.610
You could have warned us ahead of time.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.730
Proceed along this conduit.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.640
Aye.

19:19.030 --> 19:20.580
60 degrees starboard.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.090
80 degrees Z-axis.

19:25.420 --> 19:27.530
We should prepare for EVA.

19:27.530 --> 19:29.380
Let's break out the suits.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.940
We've had difficult sessions before.

19:33.030 --> 19:35.150
In the days following the founding of this Council.

19:35.290 --> 19:36.450
This is different.

19:36.850 --> 19:40.010
The Council is on the verge of tearing itself apart.

19:40.150 --> 19:41.840
You underestimate us.

19:42.190 --> 19:44.400
We were all in the same room.

19:44.660 --> 19:47.220
-You saw what happened.
- We knew it wasn't going to be easy.

19:47.220 --> 19:50.320
We are never going to convince the Reptilians.

19:50.340 --> 19:51.360
Or the Insectoids.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.920
Then we'll focus on the Aquatics.

19:52.920 --> 19:56.420
The Aquatics weigh every argument
in excruciating detail.

19:56.750 --> 19:59.410
For a long time, they were against building the weapon.

19:59.410 --> 20:00.680
What changed their minds?

20:00.680 --> 20:02.580
The Guardians addressed the Council.

20:02.580 --> 20:06.710
They presented what they claimed was
a visual record taken from the future.

20:06.950 --> 20:10.790
It showed mankind destroying
our new home world.

20:10.970 --> 20:12.900
That convinced the Aquatics.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.900
It was powerful evidence.

20:28.650 --> 20:30.410
The Avians.

20:31.230 --> 20:35.510
Once, they darkened the skies of Xindus with their numbers.

20:35.840 --> 20:39.600
We formed the Council to prevent
other Xindis from sharing their fate.

20:39.620 --> 20:42.330
Your Council just might have the opposite effect.

20:42.590 --> 20:43.930
Perhaps not.

20:44.350 --> 20:46.980
There might be a way to convince them.

20:47.820 --> 20:50.670
I'll require the services of your ship's doctor.

20:52.630 --> 20:55.760
The Council is preparing to betray its own people.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.580
Archer has achieved nothing.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.580
He has succeeded in raising doubts about us.

21:00.920 --> 21:05.570
The Arboreals, Humanoids and Aquatics
are considering what he had to say.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.890
He should never have been allowed
before the Council.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.940
I couldn't prevent it.

21:10.940 --> 21:14.880
And now they may decide
against launching the weapon.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.510
The weapon will be deployed.

21:17.570 --> 21:21.110
For that to happen,
three of the Xindi species must agree.

21:21.110 --> 21:24.270
If we could prove to them that
your people didn't build the Spheres...

21:24.270 --> 21:26.230
Prove to them...

21:26.800 --> 21:28.010
or you?

21:28.120 --> 21:32.960
My lieutenant simply wants to know
if there is a way to persuade the Council.

21:32.970 --> 21:36.410
Persuasion is no longer a viable option.

21:36.730 --> 21:39.690
You must act with the Insectoids.

21:39.970 --> 21:42.050
Secure the weapon.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.150
The weapon's well guarded.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.340
The casualties on both sides would be heavy.

21:47.770 --> 21:49.890
We'd be risking civil war.

21:49.940 --> 21:51.750
A temporary schism cannot be avoided,

21:52.960 --> 21:57.640
but eventually, Reptilians will preside over a stronger, ...

21:57.800 --> 22:00.390
unified Xindi empire.

22:01.990 --> 22:05.240
We will guarantee Reptilian dominance...

22:05.720 --> 22:08.510
if humankind is eradicated.

22:09.390 --> 22:10.850
Understood.

22:19.940 --> 22:23.530
If you ever question the Guardians again...

22:23.530 --> 22:28.270
your skin will adorn
the bow of this ship.

22:34.630 --> 22:35.940
Yes.

22:35.940 --> 22:38.160
This will be very helpful.

22:38.470 --> 22:40.420
I'll have it sent over immediately.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.950
I've never heard of this procedure.

22:43.350 --> 22:44.730
It was developed by the Aquatics.

22:44.730 --> 22:49.710
They have an innate distrust of the spoken word.
They respond more strongly to visual stimuli.

22:51.310 --> 22:52.710
You need me for something?

22:52.780 --> 22:55.340
The transport pod that carried this alien.

22:55.640 --> 22:56.760
It's in the cargo bay.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.730
There are some modifications that need to be made to it.

22:59.840 --> 23:03.580
The Captain would like you
to assist me with the work.

23:04.740 --> 23:05.900
Lucky me.

23:06.140 --> 23:09.390
Your Captain thinks there's no one better
to make these modifications.

23:09.390 --> 23:10.140
I agree.

23:10.140 --> 23:10.740
Do me a favor.

23:10.740 --> 23:12.100
Don't try to get on my "good side."

23:12.100 --> 23:14.230
I understand that you and I will always be enemies.

23:14.230 --> 23:15.730
You got that right.

23:15.990 --> 23:18.730
I can't change what happened to your sister!

23:18.730 --> 23:20.720
Or any of the seven million.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.860
But I'm risking my life.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.860
I'm risking the lives of my family.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.680
I've killed members of my own species, ...

23:28.680 --> 23:32.160
all because I'm trying to save both our worlds.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.410
This way.

23:51.020 --> 23:53.510
Picking up a very powerful energy signature.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.840
We're approaching the memory core.

23:58.330 --> 24:00.410
It's 15 meters ahead.

24:17.650 --> 24:20.320
It's practically gift-wrapped.

24:29.670 --> 24:31.510
I'm detecting some kind of movement.

24:31.510 --> 24:32.820
Can you pinpoint it?

24:32.820 --> 24:34.490
There's too much interference.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.920
I don't know where it is, but it's close.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.580
I suggest we work fast.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.010
Come in.

24:48.340 --> 24:49.820
We've completed the work.

24:50.670 --> 24:52.280
Mr. Tucker was...

24:53.560 --> 24:55.060
extremely cooperative.

24:55.990 --> 24:59.990
I know it isn't easy for him working with me.

25:03.420 --> 25:04.260
Degra.

25:07.260 --> 25:09.310
When I was on the future Enterprise, ...

25:10.970 --> 25:12.690
400 years from now,...

25:14.870 --> 25:16.530
there were Xindi aboard.

25:17.470 --> 25:21.300
Humans and Xindi were serving together in the Federation.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.170
That's a future worth fighting for.

25:35.110 --> 25:36.100
Passing notes.

25:36.670 --> 25:37.210
Sir?

25:37.210 --> 25:40.210
I got sent to the principal's office
for passing a note in class.

25:40.590 --> 25:41.970
It was to Katy Bentley.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.430
I was inviting her to a party
a friend of mine was throwing.

25:44.430 --> 25:46.480
-What'd she say?
-Funny thing.

25:46.530 --> 25:48.860
She'd already turned me down,
but after I got in trouble...

25:49.570 --> 25:52.100
Some women can't resist the bad boys.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.170
After much deliberation,...

25:56.600 --> 26:00.410
we've agreed to listen to this new evidence
you wish to present.

26:01.190 --> 26:01.980
Proceed.

26:04.630 --> 26:06.030
The Sphere-Builders--

26:06.980 --> 26:09.030
the beings you call the Guardians--

26:11.690 --> 26:13.240
are the same species.

26:13.660 --> 26:17.640
Have you manufactured more data
to support this claim?

26:18.940 --> 26:21.700
A few weeks ago, we came across an alien.

26:23.440 --> 26:26.980
He was adrift in what we believe was
a trans-dimensional disturbance.

26:28.660 --> 26:30.850
The alien was inside a pod, ...

26:31.960 --> 26:34.750
which was constructed of the same combination of alloys...

26:34.920 --> 26:37.270
that make up the outer shell of the Spheres.

26:37.580 --> 26:39.150
He was a Sphere-Builder.

26:42.730 --> 26:44.990
"You've already presented this information."

26:45.200 --> 26:46.140
Not all of it.

26:51.330 --> 26:52.450
Energize.

26:56.330 --> 26:58.660
Your data states that this ...

26:59.160 --> 27:03.600
alien disintegrated when
it came into contact with our universe.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.640
He did.

27:05.060 --> 27:07.640
What you're seeing is a biometric hologram.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.770
It's the same technology used
to train our physicians.

27:10.860 --> 27:15.640
It was constructed from medical data
collected by Enterprise's Medical Officer.

27:18.840 --> 27:23.260
"How do we the data used
to create this phantom wasn't falsified?"

27:23.260 --> 27:28.140
Humans don't have the technology
to produce a fabrication of this detail.

27:28.850 --> 27:29.660
Tell me...

27:31.170 --> 27:32.970
is this one of the Guardians?

27:35.110 --> 27:38.580
The physical resemblance is hard to deny.

27:42.110 --> 27:43.230
"It is a Guardian."

27:46.470 --> 27:48.550
"We are not deceived by this illusion.

27:48.550 --> 27:51.370
"Restore the dignity "of our Council.

27:51.610 --> 27:53.860
Expel the humans from this chamber."

27:55.280 --> 27:56.860
We...

27:56.860 --> 28:00.180
are open to hearing more.

28:01.090 --> 28:02.580
So are we.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.170
"We agree."

28:06.410 --> 28:07.320
Please.

28:07.320 --> 28:08.630
Continue.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.160
Reed to Shuttlepod One.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.520
-Anything?
- No, sir.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.000
Whatever it was, it's stopped moving.

28:33.100 --> 28:34.000
Got something.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.140
It's heading in your direction, moving fast!

28:36.140 --> 28:38.000
-I don't see anything.
-Where is it?

28:38.000 --> 28:41.270
-Give me a position!
- It's coming down from the upper left quadrant.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.530
-Are you sure?
- Damn sure.

28:44.530 --> 28:46.490
It's 70 meters away.

28:46.750 --> 28:47.870
50 meters...

28:47.870 --> 28:49.030
30...

28:49.030 --> 28:50.340
15!

28:50.340 --> 28:51.430
I see it!

29:05.010 --> 29:06.390
Go! Go!

29:35.360 --> 29:36.960
Five more headed this way.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.060
Move!

29:42.270 --> 29:45.030
I still can't pin down the problem with the converter.

29:45.030 --> 29:47.500
I think it's an energy drain somewhere.

29:48.010 --> 29:50.500
We're far from 100%.

29:52.690 --> 29:54.450
There's been a development.

29:55.440 --> 29:56.430
Dismissed.

29:56.430 --> 29:58.650
We have the three votes we need.

29:58.650 --> 30:03.840
The Reptilians have agreed
to postpone the launch of the weapon.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.960
They'll need more convincing
before they solidify their position, ...

30:09.960 --> 30:12.730
but this is a significant step.

30:13.260 --> 30:15.550
That future you spoke of...

30:16.930 --> 30:19.360
perhaps this is where it begins.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.910
Question.

30:23.870 --> 30:26.810
Those portable power cells you left us.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.900
We're having a little trouble getting them in sync.

30:31.150 --> 30:35.090
Think you can stick around
for a few minutes, give me a hand?

30:37.030 --> 30:38.090
Of course.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.550
We'll be in my ready room.

30:49.620 --> 30:50.730
Listen.

30:53.010 --> 30:55.060
About all those things I've been saying.

30:56.970 --> 30:58.710
I just want to tell you...

31:02.670 --> 31:04.750
I know you went out on a limb.

31:06.370 --> 31:09.650
If I'd suffered your loss,
I'd feel the same way.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.650
Shall we get to work?

31:15.700 --> 31:16.980
It's over here.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.490
Come in.

31:42.970 --> 31:44.820
I wasn't expecting you.

31:45.410 --> 31:48.220
There are some things we need to discuss.

31:59.910 --> 32:02.150
I've never liked this place.

32:02.900 --> 32:05.110
I've always found it to be peaceful.

32:05.410 --> 32:07.410
It's too exposed.

32:07.850 --> 32:10.940
Reptilians prefer to be near the ground.

32:11.740 --> 32:13.820
And then there's the stench.

32:13.910 --> 32:15.170
Stench?

32:15.630 --> 32:17.310
Of failure.

32:17.770 --> 32:20.320
Of a race that failed to survive.

32:23.700 --> 32:27.700
I was surprised by your decision
to postpone the launch.

32:28.450 --> 32:30.700
It seemed like the right thing to do.

32:31.490 --> 32:34.420
I hope the other members will come
to the same conclusion.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.350
They'll fall into line.

32:36.570 --> 32:40.750
I've always believed that
all Xindi long for unification.

32:42.510 --> 32:44.160
It's in our blood.

32:44.980 --> 32:46.040
I agree.

32:49.190 --> 32:50.580
The Earth ship.

32:51.350 --> 32:53.750
I'm assisting them with their engine repairs.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.600
They've found quite an ally in you.

32:57.310 --> 33:01.410
A pity you haven't extended
the same friendship to your fellow Xindi.

33:02.330 --> 33:03.370
What do you mean?

33:03.760 --> 33:07.790
We recovered a sensor encoder
from our missing scout ship.

33:08.280 --> 33:11.200
It was in the cloaking barrier of a Sphere.

33:11.640 --> 33:14.500
We were able to extract the final scans ...

33:14.500 --> 33:17.530
it took before they were destroyed...

33:18.850 --> 33:20.530
by you.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.160
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.660
The evidence is irrefutable.

33:25.660 --> 33:28.840
We have an image of your ship firing.

33:29.110 --> 33:31.240
Don't try to deny what you did.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.390
They left me no choice.

33:32.390 --> 33:36.250
And you've left me no choice.

33:40.560 --> 33:47.180
The crew of that ship are
the last Xindi you'll ever betray.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.610
When the humans have been eliminated...

33:55.920 --> 34:00.090
when the Council has been replaced
by Reptilian rule...

34:00.360 --> 34:04.990
I am going to find your wife and children...

34:06.180 --> 34:08.730
...and do the same to them.

34:09.170 --> 34:15.920
Your traitorous bloodline will end
at the tip of my blade.

34:28.090 --> 34:30.520
-Trouble sleeping now?
-That's weird.

34:30.719 --> 34:34.100
With things finally looking up,
you'd think I'd be able to get some shuteye.

34:35.090 --> 34:37.110
There's a section of mess hall up and running.

34:37.110 --> 34:40.120
-In the mood for a snack?
- Certainly.

34:42.550 --> 34:45.300
I guess you heard, the captain pulled it off.

34:45.429 --> 34:47.449
The Xindi postponed the weapon launch.

34:48.050 --> 34:50.739
You made that sound like, uh, bad news.

34:50.739 --> 34:53.480
Ever since the attack on Earth,
all I've thought about is...

34:53.480 --> 34:55.860
getting back at whoever was responsible.

34:56.060 --> 34:58.250
And now we're making peace with them.

34:58.250 --> 35:00.660
Ah, I've gotten used to the anger.

35:00.810 --> 35:02.120
It's going to be like,....

35:02.180 --> 35:04.480
I don't know, losing an old friend.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.720
You have other friends.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.980
Is it my imagination or are you losing weight?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.550
I've been hoping someone might notice.

35:13.550 --> 35:14.780
Yeah, I'm not the only one.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.440
Hoshi commented on it last week.

35:16.520 --> 35:19.350
Well, I'm pleased to see
that my efforts are yielding results.

35:19.350 --> 35:22.090
-What's your secret?
-The Nexian tapeworm.

35:22.090 --> 35:25.400
It attaches itself to the lower intestinal tract
and absorbs nutrients...

35:25.400 --> 35:26.850
Hold on, hold on.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.110
You have a worm inside you?

35:29.180 --> 35:30.370
It's perfectly harmless.

35:30.370 --> 35:32.150
Well, I hardly notice it at all.

35:32.150 --> 35:33.900
How're you going to get it out?

35:33.900 --> 35:35.600
Well, I'll insert a standard V-probe ...

35:35.600 --> 35:37.140
-into my...
-No, no, no, no, no.

35:37.140 --> 35:38.330
Never mind.

35:38.850 --> 35:41.170
-Well, it's a simple procedure.
-I'm sure it is, Doc.

35:41.810 --> 35:43.890
I just don't want to lose my appetite.

35:58.180 --> 35:59.430
Degra's dead.

36:00.110 --> 36:02.770
He was found in his quarters about an hour ago.

36:02.770 --> 36:04.070
He'd been murdered...

36:04.070 --> 36:05.170
stabbed.

36:11.890 --> 36:12.920
Who did this?

36:12.990 --> 36:16.670
The Reptilians have called
an emergency meeting of the Council.

36:16.670 --> 36:21.030
I believe their recent turnabout was nothing
more than a ruse to keep us off guard.

36:21.590 --> 36:22.910
They're planning something.

36:22.910 --> 36:24.200
I'm certain of it.

36:24.430 --> 36:26.420
Your ship's in danger.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.540
Keep me apprised.

36:34.870 --> 36:36.110
Archer to the Bridge.

36:36.260 --> 36:37.380
Bridge.

36:39.230 --> 36:40.890
Go to tactical alert.

36:42.610 --> 36:44.770
It was that last run through the cloaking barrier.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.730
The coil assembly's been damaged.

36:46.730 --> 36:47.680
Reduce speed.

36:47.680 --> 36:48.750
Hold it at half impulse.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.750
- Lieutenant?
- I'm all right!

36:52.220 --> 36:53.320
I'm fine.

36:55.420 --> 36:56.990
Maybe that's the problem.

36:58.870 --> 37:02.060
Maybe we're getting a bit
too comfortable with losing people.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.390
23 men and women.

37:06.650 --> 37:10.920
On any given mission,
the limit of acceptable casualties is 20%.

37:11.970 --> 37:14.240
So says traditional military doctrine.

37:15.030 --> 37:17.130
Well, we've crossed that margin.

37:23.570 --> 37:25.200
There's a Vulcan axiom:

37:25.540 --> 37:30.310
The needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.970
Corporal Hawkins understood that.

37:32.970 --> 37:35.520
That doesn't make his death any more acceptable.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.640
No.

37:37.190 --> 37:38.690
But it makes it honorable.

37:40.850 --> 37:43.980
-You admit killing him?
-With pride.

37:44.060 --> 37:45.220
He was a traitor.

37:45.220 --> 37:47.270
He was a member of this Council!

37:47.270 --> 37:50.180
Degra destroyed a Reptilian ship.

37:50.240 --> 37:52.250
22 crewmen died.

37:52.250 --> 37:54.620
I only regret not doing it sooner.

37:54.620 --> 37:57.020
You're going to regret a lot more than that.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.230
Why did you call this meeting?

38:00.270 --> 38:02.230
You have a decision to make.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.660
We've taken control of the weapon.

38:07.250 --> 38:08.900
We're going to launch it.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.580
And you accuse Degra of being a traitor!

38:15.560 --> 38:17.710
Either you stand with us ...

38:17.910 --> 38:19.950
or you stand against us.

38:19.950 --> 38:22.360
That's not a choice, it's an ultimatum.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.940
Call it what you will.

38:26.980 --> 38:30.000
-Neither will we!
-None of us will.

38:30.590 --> 38:32.910
Then we withdraw from this council!

38:32.910 --> 38:34.640
Think about what you are doing.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.570
This alliance has lasted for decades.

38:36.570 --> 38:38.610
It's lasted too long.

38:38.610 --> 38:40.360
You've become complacent.

38:40.360 --> 38:44.420
The weapon cannot be launched
without three of the codes.

38:44.900 --> 38:46.540
You only have two.

38:47.420 --> 38:50.930
Do you really believe we haven't considered that?

38:53.660 --> 38:55.740
I can give you three-point-four with a little coaxing, ...

38:55.740 --> 38:57.990
but some of the relays are still fried.

38:58.230 --> 38:59.690
We're in no shape for combat.

38:59.690 --> 39:01.780
That hasn't stopped us in the past.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.790
You sure they're coming after us?

39:04.340 --> 39:05.440
Count on it.

39:06.850 --> 39:09.280
I can't believe I actually feel bad about Degra.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.010
24 hours ago, I would've been celebrating.

39:13.670 --> 39:15.410
A lot can happen in a day.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.410
Bridge to Captain Archer.

39:20.410 --> 39:21.100
Archer.

39:21.370 --> 39:24.440
Five Insectoid ships are descending
toward the surface.

39:43.530 --> 39:44.480
Report.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.870
The weapon's been launched
from beneath the surface.

39:46.870 --> 39:49.340
The Insectoid ships are in formation around it.

39:50.830 --> 39:51.910
Pursuit course.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.510
We're being hailed.

39:55.470 --> 39:59.000
The Reptilians and Insectoids have seized
control of the weapon.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.250
We're tracking it.

40:00.420 --> 40:03.290
I've ordered all available ships to intercept.

40:03.430 --> 40:05.450
We're right behind you.

40:10.150 --> 40:12.220
I hope there's something in there you can use.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.020
Most definitely.

40:15.070 --> 40:17.640
There's a large group of ships leaving the system.

40:17.690 --> 40:19.200
One of them is Enterprise.

40:19.200 --> 40:21.060
I'm detecting weapons fire.

40:22.870 --> 40:23.680
Stay with it!

40:23.680 --> 40:25.000
Keep firing!

40:25.070 --> 40:26.780
It's the shuttlepod.

40:27.350 --> 40:29.910
Tell them to stay put.
We'll come back for them when we can.

40:45.830 --> 40:47.680
Open a channel to Degra's ship!

40:48.750 --> 40:49.870
We're moving in on the weapon!

40:50.440 --> 40:56.050
Concentrate your fire on the primary generators
six meters below the aft thruster!

41:05.720 --> 41:07.040
Forget the others!

41:07.040 --> 41:08.960
Target Enterprise!

41:15.420 --> 41:17.700
Get the female!

41:21.720 --> 41:23.000
Hoshi!

41:23.230 --> 41:24.740
They're disabled.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.420
The female?

41:26.940 --> 41:28.780
Generator's at maximum power.

41:28.780 --> 41:30.660
Take us into the vortex.

41:40.780 --> 41:42.330
We've lost them, sir.

41:43.305 --> 41:49.188
