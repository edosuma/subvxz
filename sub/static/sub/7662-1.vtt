02:27.857 --> 02:29.024
Jesus.

02:29.025 --> 02:31.151
Where's the nearest
good restaurant?

02:31.152 --> 02:34.780
Depends... If you you're a human,
it's back in Washington.

02:34.781 --> 02:37.242
But if you're a gator,
it could be right where we land.

02:39.202 --> 02:42.205
Thank your lucky stars
you're coming in at the end of this.

03:56.446 --> 03:58.864
Holland insisted
on building it all out here.

03:58.865 --> 04:01.325
<i>He said this is
where the life is.</i>

04:01.326 --> 04:04.287
One of those life forms
nailed the guy you're replacing.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.419
What, they sent
a woman out here?

04:13.421 --> 04:14.796
Where the hell are you going?

04:14.797 --> 04:16.173
Couldn't take it anymore.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.926
Well, he lasted longer than most.

04:56.172 --> 04:57.298
Boo.

05:10.019 --> 05:11.312
<i>Don't shoot.</i>

05:16.359 --> 05:17.318
<i>Watch your step.</i>

05:37.130 --> 05:38.965
No!

05:46.306 --> 05:47.557
Weird, isn't it?

05:47.849 --> 05:49.809
The local fishermen say
this place is haunted.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.437
I don't know where
we are, Toto,

05:53.438 --> 05:54.813
but it sure isn't Kansas.

05:54.814 --> 05:55.857
What?

05:56.774 --> 05:58.151
Nothing.

06:08.661 --> 06:11.246
Used to be a church
until about 50 years ago.

06:11.247 --> 06:13.123
Then the levee broke.

06:13.124 --> 06:15.835
Just been us and the deer flies
the last ten weeks.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.629
Welcome back, sir.

06:19.047 --> 06:20.297
What'd Washington say?

06:20.298 --> 06:21.465
That's confidential, Teddy.

06:21.466 --> 06:23.008
<i>That's okay, miss, I got it.</i>

06:23.009 --> 06:24.649
But you can start packing
your toothbrush.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.220
All right.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.224
<i>Where's this thing go?</i>

06:31.225 --> 06:32.434
<i>Give me a hand
over here with this thing.</i>

06:32.435 --> 06:33.477
<i>I got ya, man.</i>

06:33.478 --> 06:35.062
What does Holland think
about getting yanked

06:35.063 --> 06:36.521
from the swamps
back to Washington?

06:36.522 --> 06:38.106
I doubt he's even been told.

06:38.107 --> 06:40.984
Ritter couldn't believe me
when I gave him the news this morning.

06:40.985 --> 06:43.028
Do you think Washington's paranoid?

06:43.029 --> 06:44.614
Do you think the Pope is Catholic?

06:45.990 --> 06:47.450
This is your place.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.880
You probably haven't seen
half this stuff.

07:01.881 --> 07:03.173
It's all new.

07:03.174 --> 07:04.925
Take this, for instance.
This is a la...

07:04.926 --> 07:07.344
laser-induced
subsonic field generator.

07:07.345 --> 07:09.680
Gives double readings
in the 3200 band, right?

07:10.431 --> 07:12.057
I got a trick for fixing that.

07:12.058 --> 07:13.517
Just my luck
they send me someone

07:13.518 --> 07:15.477
who know what she's doin'
the week they pull us out.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.521
- What's he working on anyway?
- <i>Who?</i>

07:17.522 --> 07:18.481
Holland.

07:18.898 --> 07:20.817
This thing is so hush-hush,
no one asks.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.068
Something to do with plants.

07:23.069 --> 07:24.528
<i>Where the hell's my man?</i>

07:24.529 --> 07:25.612
<i>I thought he was back.</i>

07:25.613 --> 07:26.906
<i>Hey, Charlie!</i>

07:27.865 --> 07:29.450
Emperor calls. Come on.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.328
Hey, you know there's a...

07:37.834 --> 07:39.209
<i>What's going on here?</i>

07:39.210 --> 07:41.295
<i>Get those crates
into the church!</i>

07:41.879 --> 07:43.380
<i>You men in the boat,</i>

07:43.381 --> 07:44.714
<i>what the hell
do you think you're doing?</i>

07:44.715 --> 07:47.008
Get that dumb thing outta sight!

07:47.009 --> 07:48.177
<i>Lame brains!</i>

07:48.511 --> 07:50.220
<i>Charlie, welcome back.</i>

07:50.221 --> 07:51.972
<i>And this is Hank's replacement?</i>

07:51.973 --> 07:54.599
Cable, Harry Ritter,
Project Field Supervisor.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.852
You know one of your sensors
is reading malfunction?

07:56.853 --> 07:58.437
It's not surprising.

07:58.438 --> 08:00.313
They rot in a week
in these damn swamps.

08:00.314 --> 08:03.525
Charlie, did you get them
to change their minds?

08:03.526 --> 08:06.194
No, they want him and the substance
back in Washington

08:06.195 --> 08:07.612
where they can keep
their eyes on him.

08:07.613 --> 08:08.947
Anything wrong
that you know of?

08:08.948 --> 08:10.240
A rumor.

08:10.241 --> 08:13.493
Somebody's heard
Arcane's gotten wind of the project.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.661
I thought Arcane was dead.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.538
He is! Who said that?

08:16.539 --> 08:17.956
Who said Arcane's on to this?

08:17.957 --> 08:20.501
Nobody's taken credit for it.
You know Washington.

08:22.753 --> 08:25.630
All it takes is one loudmouth
to spill this to Holland

08:25.631 --> 08:27.757
and the whole project
goes to hell in a hand basket.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.135
- <i>You know that?</i>
- Yes, <i>sir.</i>

08:30.261 --> 08:31.929
That goes for you too.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.392
Come on. Come on.

08:37.393 --> 08:39.936
I keep the number of people
near to him at a minimum.

08:39.937 --> 08:43.565
This admits the three of us
and the Hollands.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.650
It was programmed
for your prints this morning.

08:45.651 --> 08:46.611
Try it.

08:57.455 --> 08:58.622
<i>The stuff I have
to put up with...</i>

08:58.623 --> 09:01.625
<i>alligators, bugs, poisonous snakes,
and now the rumors begin.</i>

09:01.626 --> 09:05.796
Charlie, I want to hear everything
about the Arcane business now.

09:09.133 --> 09:11.259
What about that sensor out
in sector three.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.678
Right, get somebody
to take you out there... take a look.

09:13.679 --> 09:14.889
Me?

09:16.390 --> 09:17.600
In the swamps?

09:31.531 --> 09:32.656
<i>Any luck there?</i>

09:32.657 --> 09:33.824
Wiggle your fingers.

09:35.451 --> 09:36.702
Lose a contact lens?

09:38.412 --> 09:39.622
Funny.

09:40.456 --> 09:42.791
Well, don't just stand there,
give us a hand.

09:42.792 --> 09:43.832
Right about in the middle.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.170
Please.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.177
I dropped a Cooper's Digger.

09:54.220 --> 09:55.740
Would you look
under the rocks, please?

09:57.181 --> 09:58.266
Go ahead.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.021
What's a Cooper's Digger anyway,
some kind of shovel?

10:05.022 --> 10:06.357
Nah.

10:07.858 --> 10:08.943
Just Alessandro.

10:11.279 --> 10:13.488
Got a little one-celled animal
living in his fur

10:13.489 --> 10:14.865
that makes a terrific host.

10:16.909 --> 10:18.285
Terrific.

10:18.286 --> 10:20.329
I'll remember that
the next time I throw a party.

10:20.538 --> 10:22.790
Oh, not bad, not bad.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.459
You don't have to be crazy
to be around him,

10:26.460 --> 10:27.628
but it helps.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.338
Alice Cable,
new kid on the block.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.465
You guy's part of Holland's crew?

10:32.466 --> 10:33.718
I'm Linda Holland.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.261
You're Doctor Holland.

10:36.262 --> 10:39.222
I'm a Doctor Holland,
but not the Doctor Holland...

10:39.223 --> 10:40.432
boy genius and oddball.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.934
That's Alec, he's the brains
in the family.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.686
I just cook up what he invents.

10:44.687 --> 10:45.895
Oh, no, don't you believe her.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.647
She's got an IQ
like a phone number.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.024
Which reminds me,

10:49.025 --> 10:51.067
I want you to run up
a new variation on the formula

10:51.068 --> 10:52.819
with that little host
on Alessandro's fur.

10:52.820 --> 10:53.904
Okay.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.908
Hello.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.870
I understand you have
a sensor out.

11:01.871 --> 11:03.151
You wanna go out
and take a look?

11:03.539 --> 11:08.084
Well, I guess I could
ask Charlie to give us an escort.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.337
Maybe we could ask
your mother to come along too.

11:10.338 --> 11:11.630
Come on.

11:11.631 --> 11:12.839
The only dangerous thing out there

11:12.840 --> 11:15.134
are those government agents
with their popguns.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.177
It's your first day on the job.

11:17.178 --> 11:18.970
I'll take you on a cook's tour.

11:18.971 --> 11:21.139
I mean, Ritter's always after me
to get some fresh air.

11:21.140 --> 11:22.380
He'll... he'll be tickled pink.

11:24.352 --> 11:25.603
What do you say?

11:35.529 --> 11:38.198
Oh, man.

11:38.199 --> 11:39.324
You look like a tree.

11:39.325 --> 11:41.619
Sometimes I feel like a tree.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.203
Like the swamps?

11:43.204 --> 11:44.579
Hate the swamps.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.790
Hate bugs,
hate things without legs.

11:46.791 --> 11:48.125
A neatness freak?

11:48.959 --> 11:50.752
You could eat off
my kitchen floor.

11:50.753 --> 11:51.921
You could eat off the swamps.

11:52.922 --> 11:55.299
<i>Maybe half the world
could eat off the swamps.</i>

11:55.841 --> 11:58.094
More than likely,
the swamps'll eat off us.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.346
Like, what happened to the guy
I'm replacing, for instance?

12:01.347 --> 12:03.474
The gator was only following
his natural way.

12:04.475 --> 12:05.768
Can't blame a guy for that.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.823
I paid a fortune
for these boots.

12:19.865 --> 12:22.665
You better keep moving, there's
a fair amount of quicksand around here.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.995
- You better keep <i>your</i> eyes <i>open</i> too.
- For what?

12:25.996 --> 12:29.417
Or one of these just might
jump out and do you in.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.460
You know there's over a hundred species
of Genus Orchia here.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.212
There's so much beauty
in the swamps

12:34.213 --> 12:35.463
if you just open up
your eyes to it.

12:35.464 --> 12:38.842
I mean, take a look
into your own body,

12:38.843 --> 12:40.552
one of God's most
magnificent creations,

12:40.553 --> 12:41.678
and what do you see?

12:41.679 --> 12:44.848
Straight lines and deodorant
and chrome and Formica?

12:44.849 --> 12:48.017
No, no, no, you see
blood and bone, pump and flow

12:48.018 --> 12:50.311
and a million messy miracles.

12:50.312 --> 12:51.896
I mean, just look
at the most creative thing

12:51.897 --> 12:53.356
a man and a woman
can do together

12:53.357 --> 12:54.899
and you'll see
something growing.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.860
Unpredictable.

12:56.861 --> 12:58.027
Magical.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.155
Hot.

13:00.990 --> 13:03.117
Just save the malarkey
for your wife, Holland.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.287
If you don't mind,
where the hell's the sensor?

13:07.288 --> 13:09.957
It's right over there.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.131
Looks okay to me.

13:18.299 --> 13:19.425
Here, let me help.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.647
Well, it doesn't look
okay to me.

13:35.191 --> 13:36.734
- Let's get back.
- All right.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.384
Charlie?

14:07.640 --> 14:08.891
Charlie.

14:11.936 --> 14:12.977
Cable?

14:12.978 --> 14:14.771
What in the hell is your story?

14:14.772 --> 14:16.940
Charlie, did anything suspicious happen
while we were gone?

14:16.941 --> 14:18.066
You're damn right!

14:18.067 --> 14:20.026
Something suspicious did happen!

14:20.027 --> 14:23.404
A stupid broad of an agent,
first day on the job,

14:23.405 --> 14:26.324
takes a scientist
we're all supposed to be guarding

14:26.325 --> 14:28.369
for an unguarded romp
in the bush!

14:28.577 --> 14:30.286
<i>Hold it.
Just cool it a minute, all right?</i>

14:30.287 --> 14:31.830
<i>You think you're
on a picnic or something?</i>

14:31.831 --> 14:34.457
Wait a minute, Ritter,
it was my idea to take her out there.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.583
She was just doin her job.

14:35.584 --> 14:37.252
Why do you have to be
so worried all the time for?

14:37.253 --> 14:38.753
Because it's my job to worry.

14:38.754 --> 14:40.713
And if I have my way,
and by God I will,

14:40.714 --> 14:42.841
you'll be on the next chopper
back to Washington.

14:42.842 --> 14:45.010
A woman has no place
around a guy like you.

14:47.471 --> 14:49.722
There's a cut sensor out there,
what about that?

14:49.723 --> 14:50.765
Which sector?

14:50.766 --> 14:51.975
<i>Sector three.</i>

14:51.976 --> 14:55.103
Hank was working on that one
when he was bitten by the gator.

14:55.104 --> 14:57.981
Needless to say, he didn't put it
all back together again

14:57.982 --> 14:59.775
before we took him
to the hospital.

15:04.989 --> 15:06.323
Tickled pink?

15:06.824 --> 15:08.951
I'm really sorry, Cable.

15:10.536 --> 15:14.498
Well, I guess you can't be blamed
for following your natural way.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.834
Did either of you see
one of our guys out there?

15:17.835 --> 15:18.918
Ronnie?

15:18.919 --> 15:20.170
No, why?

15:21.297 --> 15:23.048
We seem to have
lost contact with him.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.427
<i>- Hey, what's that?
- Back off, get back.</i>

15:32.182 --> 15:34.017
Linda, are you all right?

15:34.018 --> 15:35.269
<i>It's okay, it's okay!</i>

15:35.769 --> 15:37.187
Oh, dear God.

15:42.026 --> 15:43.193
The damnedest thing.

15:43.861 --> 15:45.695
You know this new batch
you had me cook up

15:45.696 --> 15:47.531
with the host
from Alessandro's fur?

15:48.574 --> 15:50.575
I knew we were up
to something revolutionary.

15:50.576 --> 15:53.202
But this is literally dynamite.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.705
Watch.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.502
Incredible.

16:01.503 --> 16:02.795
Weird?

16:02.796 --> 16:04.047
Yeah.

16:04.048 --> 16:07.717
Congratulations, you managed
to reinvent nitro.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.929
Let's hope this project
doesn't end with a bang.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.015
Oh, come on, Charlie, please.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.391
I gotta write this down.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.853
I thought you were working
on some sort of weapons system.

16:18.562 --> 16:21.356
<i>- I</i> knew <i>it</i> wasn't just plants.
- Plants, plants.

16:21.357 --> 16:22.649
The only way
lever thought my work

16:22.650 --> 16:24.609
would be explosive
was social, if you believe it.

16:24.610 --> 16:27.195
The stuff we've been working with
has never been this volatile before.

16:27.196 --> 16:30.239
Linda, cut up a sample of that
for the electron microscope, please.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.283
- Right.
- And be exceptionally careful with it.

16:32.284 --> 16:33.368
- All right?
- Don't worry.

16:33.369 --> 16:35.078
What is it you've
been doing here, Holland?

16:35.079 --> 16:36.359
Come on over here,
I'll show you.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.220
Now, you see those little guys?

16:51.845 --> 16:55.640
DNA chromosomes
from the common lab bacilli E. Coli.

16:55.641 --> 16:56.808
Now, you see that one?

16:56.809 --> 16:57.934
Another simple bacilli.

16:57.935 --> 16:59.645
Plant matrix called D Complex.

17:00.104 --> 17:03.773
Now, each of these organisms
have existed in the labs for years.

17:03.774 --> 17:06.275
But always separately,
which isn't too surprising

17:06.276 --> 17:07.777
since one is animal,
the other's vegetable.

17:07.778 --> 17:11.114
But now this is what we've developed
over the last couple of months.

17:11.115 --> 17:12.366
You see that little guy?

17:12.700 --> 17:14.951
Never existed on the face
of the Earth before.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.078
That's my baby-.

17:16.453 --> 17:20.082
A simple vegetable cell
with an unmistakable animal nucleus.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.584
Recombinant DNA?

17:23.460 --> 17:24.627
Hey, that's very good.

17:26.547 --> 17:28.756
I'm very close
to developing a plant

17:28.757 --> 17:31.885
with an animal's aggressive
power for survival.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.221
A plant for the 21st century.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.849
What do you want, watermelons
the size of weather balloons?

17:37.850 --> 17:39.559
Or tomatoes that'll fetch a stick.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.228
Well, I wouldn't mind a tomato
that could grow in the desert.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.480
Or soybeans
that could thrive in Biafra.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.274
Or corn that could grow
in the good old U.S. of A.,

17:46.275 --> 17:49.527
say in the year 2001, when there'll be
6 1/2 billion people on this planet.

17:49.528 --> 17:51.779
<i>All of them hungry.
How you doin' there, Linda?</i>

17:51.780 --> 17:52.905
<i>It's all set.</i>

17:52.906 --> 17:54.616
Vector 3-3-7-9.

17:55.034 --> 17:56.201
Okay.

18:01.957 --> 18:05.127
- It's replicating like mad.
- It certainly is.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.172
Well, come on,
let's try it on something.

18:09.173 --> 18:12.009
Cable, would you bring that flask
of water over here, please?

18:15.054 --> 18:16.137
Thank you.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.307
If it would work on plants
the way you want it to,

18:18.932 --> 18:20.641
what will it do to people?

18:20.642 --> 18:22.810
And what if it falls
in the wrong hands?

18:22.811 --> 18:25.064
Arcane boogie man mentality?

18:25.731 --> 18:26.939
Okay, now we begin.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.025
I have 2,000 water.

18:29.985 --> 18:32.737
One part formula.

18:32.738 --> 18:35.991
<i>Two thousand water, 6:30, March 20.</i>

18:45.000 --> 18:47.210
- How long before you'll know?
- What?

18:47.211 --> 18:48.711
Look, what do you want it to do?

18:48.712 --> 18:50.797
Jump out of the beaker
and dance a fandango?

18:50.798 --> 18:52.340
I don't know, a week maybe.

18:52.341 --> 18:53.383
Maybe longer.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.637
This has all the thrills
of watching grass grow.

18:58.222 --> 19:00.582
Aren't there some sensors out there
you could be working on?

19:04.103 --> 19:06.187
- Oops.
- Forget it.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.814
He's just ridiculously sensitive.

19:07.815 --> 19:09.191
Our dad was the same.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.610
Your dad?

19:12.069 --> 19:14.404
You've never heard of Walter Holland,
the biophysicist?

19:15.155 --> 19:16.572
Nobel prize?

19:16.573 --> 19:19.243
He used to throw a mean
Bunsen burner, I can tell ya.

19:19.701 --> 19:23.038
Alec and I spent half our childhood
cleaning up after his tantrums.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.790
Perfectionist 'til the day he died.

19:25.791 --> 19:27.126
Alec's the same.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.360
Oh, my God.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.736
What is that?

19:55.737 --> 19:58.322
Cable, I don't believe this.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.909
All the places
that Linda dropped the formula,

20:01.660 --> 20:02.953
the boards grew.

20:03.829 --> 20:04.912
Are you kidding?

20:04.913 --> 20:06.123
No, I'm not kidding.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.750
- Alec.
- Linda!

20:09.751 --> 20:12.170
<i>- What?</i>
- Get in here quick!

20:12.171 --> 20:13.754
- This is fantastic.
- Alec.

20:13.755 --> 20:14.715
This is incredible!

20:21.763 --> 20:24.056
Alec, the formula?

20:24.057 --> 20:26.601
Ritter, he's gotta be told
right away.

20:26.602 --> 20:29.146
I wanna see that bastard's face
when he realizes we've done it!

20:32.941 --> 20:34.109
Ritter!

20:35.485 --> 20:37.112
Ritter!

20:39.656 --> 20:41.073
You guys seen Ritter?

20:41.074 --> 20:42.450
<i>He's in the command shed.</i>

20:42.451 --> 20:43.660
Thanks.

20:53.629 --> 20:54.755
Ritter.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.876
Charlie.

21:56.233 --> 21:57.901
Hey!

22:06.076 --> 22:07.119
Get up!

22:09.955 --> 22:10.914
Hold it!

22:11.331 --> 22:12.958
- I'm holdin'.
- It's over, lady.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.587
Arcane, right?

22:18.588 --> 22:19.839
Shut up.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.508
Alec, watch out!...

22:33.228 --> 22:35.146
Very interesting,
Doctor Holland.

22:35.147 --> 22:36.189
On your feet.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.817
Who are you?

22:39.818 --> 22:40.944
Interesting.

22:41.570 --> 22:42.611
Let go!

22:42.612 --> 22:46.033
Now, I know I haven't seen
anything like... this before.

22:51.830 --> 22:52.789
Have you?

22:53.540 --> 22:54.791
What the hell do you want?

22:56.293 --> 22:58.753
I represent a certain party
that's...

22:58.754 --> 23:00.588
interested in your formula.

23:00.589 --> 23:02.215
<i>They'd give an arm
and a leg for it.</i>

23:02.674 --> 23:05.009
Your arm and leg, if necessary.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.802
Get out of my lab!

23:06.803 --> 23:08.138
- Get out!
- Alec.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.182
<i>What's the hold up?</i>

23:14.770 --> 23:16.355
He's being difficult.

23:16.688 --> 23:19.316
No, Ritter, not you.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.777
No, Doctor Holland, not Ritter.

23:22.611 --> 23:26.531
Ritter, poor fellow, is long dead.

23:33.705 --> 23:36.540
You have heard of,
but never seen me.

23:36.541 --> 23:38.626
So, I will introduce myself.

23:38.627 --> 23:40.504
My name is Arcane.

23:41.463 --> 23:44.298
Linda, come here. Here.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.425
Leave her alone.

23:47.719 --> 23:48.887
Thank you.

23:50.722 --> 23:55.142
All materials pertaining
to the substance, now,

23:55.143 --> 23:56.311
or she dies.

23:56.728 --> 24:00.941
What sort of rejuvenation will
you be able to perform on her then?

24:02.192 --> 24:03.402
All right.

24:04.653 --> 24:05.820
Don't Alec.

24:05.821 --> 24:07.072
It's all right.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.335
The actual solution as well.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.262
Linda!

24:31.096 --> 24:32.222
Linda!

24:32.681 --> 24:33.974
Linda!

24:44.317 --> 24:47.154
What is best for you
is not to be born.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.029
Not to be.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.532
To be nothing.

24:51.074 --> 24:54.994
But the second best
for you is to die soon.

24:54.995 --> 24:56.079
Nietzsche.

25:33.408 --> 25:35.075
The notebooks.

25:35.076 --> 25:37.237
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Look out where?

25:54.721 --> 25:57.307
The notebooks... good.

26:02.229 --> 26:04.523
Strip it. No bodies.

26:04.981 --> 26:06.399
No witnesses.

26:08.485 --> 26:10.111
Yo...

26:12.948 --> 26:14.657
Survivors, no place for any.

26:14.658 --> 26:16.242
You, come here a second.

26:16.243 --> 26:17.284
- Burn the papers.
- Yes, sir.

26:17.285 --> 26:19.370
Burn everything.
Come on, get a move on!

26:19.371 --> 26:21.038
<i>Hey, somebody help Bruno
with the bodies.</i>

26:21.039 --> 26:22.039
<i>He's doin' it by himself.</i>

26:22.415 --> 26:24.167
<i>I want this place
clean by dawn.</i>

26:47.691 --> 26:49.109
Is that the last of 'em?

26:49.568 --> 26:52.195
- That's it!
- Then get the lead out!

27:00.120 --> 27:02.454
The final check
and let's vacate the premises.

27:02.455 --> 27:03.615
Right. Take that to the boat.

27:08.086 --> 27:09.295
Hurry it up!

27:09.296 --> 27:11.088
<i>Wait a minute, wait a minute!</i>

27:11.089 --> 27:13.090
<i>I'm finding lot's
of good stuff down here.</i>

27:13.091 --> 27:14.341
What kind of stuff?

27:14.342 --> 27:15.844
<i>A little of this,
a little of that.</i>

27:16.094 --> 27:17.429
<i>Come on down and take a look.</i>

27:23.685 --> 27:24.727
Whatcha got?

27:24.728 --> 27:26.687
Found some money,
a watch, and a couple of...

27:26.688 --> 27:29.565
- No, this.
- Oh, that.

27:29.566 --> 27:30.774
I took it off the girl.

27:30.775 --> 27:31.735
<i>You can have it.</i>

27:32.027 --> 27:34.278
Ain't worth nothin' compared
to the watches anyway.

27:34.279 --> 27:36.072
Get out in front,
we're getting out of here.

28:03.725 --> 28:04.726
Ferret?

28:19.532 --> 28:21.826
Plannin' on goin' somewhere?

28:22.994 --> 28:24.496
Come on,
let's take a little walk.

28:25.789 --> 28:26.914
Bastard!

28:26.915 --> 28:29.291
My, have you gotten dirty.

28:29.292 --> 28:30.793
My goodness.

28:30.794 --> 28:33.003
- Willie, come here.
- Yeah.

28:33.004 --> 28:35.214
I think this lady needs a bath.

28:35.215 --> 28:36.715
Let's take her down to the dock.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.425
Hey, where'd she come from?

28:38.426 --> 28:40.261
Help!

28:44.099 --> 28:45.433
Get the boat ready!

28:49.229 --> 28:50.646
Now, move it!

28:50.647 --> 28:52.189
We don't have all day
and I'm going to teach

28:52.190 --> 28:53.816
this lady how to swim.

28:53.817 --> 28:55.192
You know what
the first lesson is?

28:55.193 --> 28:56.986
It's call the dead man's...

28:59.698 --> 29:01.574
So you want to play rough?

29:08.957 --> 29:10.458
<i>There she goes.</i>

29:53.501 --> 29:56.129
Say hello
to your boyfriend, baby.

30:02.594 --> 30:03.887
What the hell was that?

30:10.185 --> 30:13.646
Willie, Tyrone,
shoot the damn thing!

30:28.244 --> 30:31.038
Get it, kill it, and her!

30:31.039 --> 30:32.332
You too!

30:35.418 --> 30:36.836
Back in the swamps.

30:47.806 --> 30:49.556
Willie, go that way.

30:49.557 --> 30:50.975
Tyrone, cover that area.

31:22.757 --> 31:24.050
So long, baby.

31:27.846 --> 31:28.888
Willie?

31:33.184 --> 31:34.519
Flank right.

32:49.761 --> 32:51.596
What the hell
are you doing, Danny?

32:56.059 --> 32:57.143
Spread out.

32:58.061 --> 32:59.354
Use your head.

33:15.286 --> 33:17.163
- Where's Danny?
- Where's Willie?

33:18.247 --> 33:19.873
Maybe Willie's with Tyrone.

33:19.874 --> 33:21.124
Danny shot Tyrone.

33:21.125 --> 33:22.210
Oh, yeah.

33:25.922 --> 33:27.673
Maybe we should,
maybe we should...

33:27.674 --> 33:29.217
Get the hell outta here.

33:41.479 --> 33:44.482
The work with DNA I expected.

33:45.149 --> 33:48.277
But the combining
of plant and animal...

33:48.861 --> 33:50.530
is astonishing.

33:52.907 --> 33:53.950
Astonishing.

33:56.327 --> 33:57.787
You should sleep, sir.

33:58.496 --> 33:59.580
I can't.

34:00.415 --> 34:04.084
It was all so near, right there,
in the palm of my hand.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.128
And...

34:05.962 --> 34:09.924
But it's lovely not to sleep...

34:10.632 --> 34:14.971
knowing that I'll soon make
the substance for myself.

34:15.304 --> 34:16.764
Have some coffee, sir.

34:17.598 --> 34:18.683
Thank you.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.983
Holland had great talent.

34:28.818 --> 34:32.030
But talent does only what it can.

34:35.324 --> 34:38.411
Genius does what it must.

34:39.203 --> 34:41.163
It is master of man.

34:41.164 --> 34:43.541
The power absolute.

34:44.125 --> 34:47.627
And in your hands, sir,
how magnificent.

34:47.628 --> 34:49.170
<i>How beautiful.</i>

34:49.172 --> 34:50.547
Yes.

34:51.257 --> 34:54.052
The world will bow or starve.

34:54.510 --> 34:55.636
Yes.

34:58.222 --> 34:59.307
Yes.

35:10.359 --> 35:13.821
Four, five... six.

35:15.198 --> 35:17.199
How many notebooks were there?

35:17.200 --> 35:18.533
Six, I think.

35:18.534 --> 35:22.205
But six ends with notes
two weeks old.

35:23.081 --> 35:24.332
It's unfinished.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.168
There must be another.

35:27.752 --> 35:29.921
A seventh notebook.

35:32.632 --> 35:34.050
Ferret has just radioed, sir.

35:35.093 --> 35:36.719
- Something's happened.
- What?

35:37.970 --> 35:39.222
Something about a...

35:39.889 --> 35:41.766
Well, you better speak
to him yourself, sir.

35:57.406 --> 35:58.366
What?

35:58.991 --> 36:00.117
You're not going to believe this.

36:00.118 --> 36:01.701
Something incredible
came out of the swamps.

36:01.702 --> 36:04.079
- Bruno.
- What came out of the swamps?

36:04.080 --> 36:05.414
Some kinda animal or something.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.249
Got the men.

36:07.250 --> 36:10.002
We wouldn't even be here
if it hadn't got after the girl first.

36:10.253 --> 36:11.212
Girl?

36:11.754 --> 36:13.381
<i>You mean you let her get away?</i>

36:45.746 --> 36:47.915
Here comes trouble.

36:50.918 --> 36:51.878
Hi.

36:54.088 --> 36:55.298
You in a plane crash?

36:56.883 --> 36:58.259
Just been out walkin'.

37:01.095 --> 37:02.305
You got a phone that works?

37:20.323 --> 37:21.656
<i>Operations.</i>

37:21.657 --> 37:23.241
This is 5-17.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.993
Operation Mount Pisba.

37:24.994 --> 37:27.704
Get me my next immediate superior,
please, and hurry.

37:27.705 --> 37:29.122
<i>Hold on.</i>

37:29.123 --> 37:30.790
<i>I'm putting you through to Ritter.</i>

37:30.791 --> 37:32.168
I think he's been neutral...

37:37.632 --> 37:41.092
Yes.

37:41.093 --> 37:42.928
<i>This is mobile operator 3-4.</i>

37:42.929 --> 37:44.804
<i>I have an emergency
call for you.</i>

37:44.805 --> 37:46.349
Put the call through.

37:46.891 --> 37:48.350
<i>Ritter, this is Cable.</i>

37:48.351 --> 37:51.228
<i>We've had...
a catastrophe out here.</i>

37:51.229 --> 37:52.354
What happened?

37:52.355 --> 37:53.813
<i>There was a hit
on the compound.</i>

37:53.814 --> 37:55.523
<i>Holland's dead, the lab's gone.</i>

37:55.524 --> 37:57.234
<i>I thought they got you too.</i>

37:57.235 --> 37:59.361
No, I was called away.

37:59.362 --> 38:01.404
<i>Well, I think you were wrong
about Arcane.</i>

38:01.405 --> 38:03.323
These <i>guys knew
what they were looking for.</i>

38:03.324 --> 38:04.449
<i>And there's only one person...</i>

38:04.450 --> 38:06.701
Hold on, we'll get to you.
You can explain later.

38:06.702 --> 38:07.744
Where are you?

38:07.745 --> 38:10.331
A gas station a mile south
of the road to the landing.

38:10.706 --> 38:11.915
Right.

38:11.916 --> 38:15.378
Did you manage
to save anything?

38:15.544 --> 38:16.795
Damn right.

38:16.796 --> 38:18.214
I got the last notebook.

38:18.589 --> 38:19.965
Very good.

38:19.966 --> 38:21.758
I'll be there
before you know it.

38:21.759 --> 38:23.052
Turn around.

38:48.202 --> 38:50.078
Doesn't anything work
around here?

38:50.079 --> 38:51.205
Just me.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.792
Kickin' it don't help nothin'.

38:55.793 --> 38:57.086
You gotta punch it.

39:02.508 --> 39:03.550
Thanks.

39:03.551 --> 39:05.052
Nothin', name's Jude.

39:05.720 --> 39:06.804
Cable.

39:21.402 --> 39:22.819
Nice station.

39:22.820 --> 39:23.904
Your dad own it?

39:26.073 --> 39:27.908
Look like your ride's got here.

39:34.290 --> 39:35.249
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

39:46.469 --> 39:47.761
Don't be afraid, Jude.

39:47.762 --> 39:50.362
You better say that to someone
whose desk you ain't hidin' behind.

39:54.268 --> 39:55.477
Is there a gun here?

39:55.478 --> 39:56.978
What kind of place
you think this is?

39:56.979 --> 39:58.189
Of course, there is.

40:05.321 --> 40:06.739
Gun's a museum piece.

40:07.281 --> 40:08.324
Stay here.

40:09.784 --> 40:11.535
Took the words
right outta my mouth.

40:17.041 --> 40:18.625
Hey, greaseball!

40:18.626 --> 40:19.794
She's mine.

40:22.546 --> 40:23.881
<i>She's got a gun.</i>

40:25.966 --> 40:27.802
Some gun, it blew up
on the first shot.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.388
<i>Let's go.</i>

40:42.483 --> 40:45.069
Jam it! Jam it to the floor!

40:50.074 --> 40:51.492
Wait a minute. There she is.

40:52.535 --> 40:55.329
Go, go! Go get her, go on!

40:56.372 --> 40:57.373
Go on!

41:03.045 --> 41:04.213
Watch the tree!

41:05.131 --> 41:06.090
Go, go!

41:06.465 --> 41:08.300
<i>Come on,
she's gaining ground on ya!</i>

41:33.909 --> 41:35.035
Hey, there she is.

41:39.915 --> 41:40.875
Faster!

41:52.761 --> 41:54.013
Got her in your sights.

41:55.931 --> 41:57.223
It's back, stop the Jeep!

41:57.224 --> 41:58.600
<i>Run her down.</i>

41:58.601 --> 41:59.643
Don't stop!

42:47.066 --> 42:48.025
Shoo!

42:52.571 --> 42:53.614
Go!

43:18.514 --> 43:21.599
It's okay, it's okay, it's just me.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.560
Oh, Jude, what are
you doing here?

43:23.561 --> 43:25.019
If you think I'm gonna stay
at the station

43:25.020 --> 43:26.521
while they're pumping it
full of holes,

43:26.522 --> 43:27.982
you're mistaken.

43:29.817 --> 43:31.151
<i>What happened to that thing?</i>

43:32.194 --> 43:33.779
It...

43:34.655 --> 43:36.198
hit a tree.

43:37.366 --> 43:39.826
Musta been one of those
hit and run kinda trees.

43:39.827 --> 43:41.495
Don't seem to be there now.

43:45.916 --> 43:47.334
Some tree, all right.

43:48.294 --> 43:50.129
There's a trapper's cabin nearby.

43:50.546 --> 43:52.673
<i>Maybe we can get you
a fresh change of clothes.</i>

43:53.549 --> 43:55.426
Swamp's no place to be at night.

43:56.135 --> 43:57.219
Come on.

44:10.566 --> 44:12.109
The last patrol is in.

44:13.235 --> 44:15.237
Whatever it is,
it disappeared for the night.

44:15.738 --> 44:17.238
Some of the men say
it's one of those

44:17.239 --> 44:19.157
abdominal snowmen or something.

44:19.158 --> 44:20.909
<i>I tell you, it was like hittin' a tree.</i>

44:21.493 --> 44:23.746
<i>And bullets hurt it,
but they don't seem to stop it.</i>

44:24.288 --> 44:25.913
<i>I say we forget this notebook.</i>

44:25.914 --> 44:27.498
It's... it's not worth it.

44:27.499 --> 44:29.168
What are we killin'
ourselves for?

44:29.793 --> 44:32.378
Just to find the formula to some...

44:32.379 --> 44:34.172
ordinary plant fertilizer?

44:34.173 --> 44:35.215
Ordinary?

44:35.758 --> 44:39.887
Something extraordinary came out
of the experiments already.

44:40.638 --> 44:44.182
Something that Holland or myself
had absolutely no notion of.

44:44.183 --> 44:45.142
None!

44:56.153 --> 44:59.530
Would you recognize immortality

44:59.531 --> 45:01.450
if it knocked on your door,
gentlemen?

45:02.159 --> 45:05.370
Obviously, you wouldn't,
but that's beside the point.

45:05.371 --> 45:08.289
I want this swamp thing

45:08.290 --> 45:10.166
and I want the notebook.

45:10.167 --> 45:11.542
Now.

45:11.543 --> 45:12.752
<i>Don't worry, I'll get rid of him.</i>

45:12.753 --> 45:14.338
You will not get rid of him.

45:15.172 --> 45:17.883
You will simply... get him.

45:22.638 --> 45:26.850
Pure elements of the formula
that determines him are there...

45:28.018 --> 45:29.436
in his veins.

45:30.479 --> 45:33.607
But... how can we find it?

45:34.274 --> 45:36.235
It... It's gone into the swamps.

45:37.319 --> 45:40.322
Every time you've seen the girl,
you've seen the beast, right?

45:41.240 --> 45:42.366
That's right.

45:42.574 --> 45:45.327
Then we'll find the girl,
the beast will follow.

45:46.620 --> 45:50.416
It doesn't exactly maintain
a low profile.

46:22.656 --> 46:23.991
He was right.

46:24.908 --> 46:26.951
It is beautiful.

46:26.952 --> 46:28.828
Who was right?

46:28.829 --> 46:29.997
A guy I knew.

46:30.622 --> 46:32.124
He loved these swamps.

46:32.875 --> 46:34.292
Can't you call him?

46:34.293 --> 46:35.669
Maybe he can come and get you.

46:39.506 --> 46:41.216
Ain't got nobody you can call?

46:41.759 --> 46:42.885
Thought I had.

46:43.635 --> 46:46.929
But when I did, those goons
showed up back there

46:46.930 --> 46:49.850
and started making Swiss cheese
outta your gas station.

46:50.726 --> 46:52.269
Didn't pay your bookie
or somethin'?

46:52.936 --> 46:54.229
Or somethin'.

46:54.855 --> 46:56.023
Much farther?

46:58.567 --> 46:59.943
Little ways.

48:06.885 --> 48:08.011
Stay here.

48:08.345 --> 48:09.680
Don't worry.

48:12.140 --> 48:13.975
If you hear anyone,
you give a yell.

48:13.976 --> 48:14.935
Don't worry.

48:15.394 --> 48:19.313
And if I don't come,
just go on and get yourself out.

48:19.314 --> 48:20.857
I can handle myself.

48:20.858 --> 48:21.942
Don't worry.

48:22.317 --> 48:23.485
I'm not worried.

48:25.404 --> 48:26.613
Well, I am.

50:00.874 --> 50:02.583
- What happened?
- Just go!

50:02.584 --> 50:03.543
Go!

50:05.587 --> 50:07.296
We're just gonna do our job

50:07.297 --> 50:09.132
and get this notebook
back to Washington.

50:10.801 --> 50:12.219
The rest isn't my business.

51:41.141 --> 51:44.102
Local people say this place
is full of ghosts.

51:46.021 --> 51:48.732
Well, there's gonna be one more
before this day is through.

51:49.524 --> 51:50.650
There she is.

51:55.781 --> 51:56.782
Who's that?

52:01.703 --> 52:03.079
Who's that?

52:03.080 --> 52:04.915
That was that thing.
Let's go, come on!

52:15.050 --> 52:16.384
What the heck's going on here?

52:21.181 --> 52:22.265
Cut the engine.

52:30.565 --> 52:31.982
- Units one and two.
- Roger.

52:31.983 --> 52:34.068
Sector four on the double.

52:34.069 --> 52:35.237
We got him cornered.

52:42.536 --> 52:43.744
Where is he?

52:43.745 --> 52:45.664
What is he?

52:53.004 --> 52:54.089
I think I see him.

53:12.274 --> 53:14.484
Unit 1 and 2,
where the hell are you?

53:14.651 --> 53:15.819
Get over here on the double!

53:16.236 --> 53:18.404
Split up. Go in the back way.

53:18.405 --> 53:19.864
We'll come in straight.

53:19.865 --> 53:21.116
Come here.

53:28.373 --> 53:29.624
There he is, over there.

53:32.169 --> 53:33.420
Open up on him.

53:35.964 --> 53:37.757
Hang on, I'm gonna knock
him outta there.

53:45.682 --> 53:48.934
Jesus! Unit two,
use the grenades if you have to.

53:48.935 --> 53:50.187
<i>Maybe we can stun him.</i>

54:06.203 --> 54:07.913
Good hit, I think you got him.

54:08.872 --> 54:11.290
He's still goin'.
Give him everything you got.

54:11.291 --> 54:12.751
Come on.

54:29.476 --> 54:30.936
We got him now!

54:43.865 --> 54:45.825
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

55:01.549 --> 55:02.591
Do you see him?

55:02.592 --> 55:04.177
Yeah, I see him everywhere.

55:06.680 --> 55:08.180
Any sign of him over there?

55:08.181 --> 55:10.432
<i>Nothing, we think maybe
he bought the farm,</i>

55:10.433 --> 55:11.851
<i>or the vegetable patch.</i>

55:28.618 --> 55:30.036
Who the hell is that?

55:51.433 --> 55:54.310
Smart, that thing is smart.

55:54.311 --> 55:57.313
Very smart, Bruno, very smart.

55:57.314 --> 56:00.441
This thing is
considerably intelligent.

56:00.442 --> 56:03.068
He's like a brilliant chess player.

56:03.069 --> 56:05.280
He anticipates every move.

56:06.865 --> 56:10.492
A strong adversary is like
a beautiful, dangerous woman.

56:10.493 --> 56:12.328
I've never been able
to resist either.

56:12.329 --> 56:13.871
Tell the captain to weigh anchor.

56:13.872 --> 56:15.790
- We're going home.
- No, we're not.

56:17.417 --> 56:19.461
Captured our knight...

56:20.837 --> 56:22.964
exposed his queen.

56:25.008 --> 56:27.302
Our move.

56:55.705 --> 56:57.373
Awfully quiet now.

56:57.374 --> 56:58.624
<i>We better get outta here.</i>

56:58.625 --> 56:59.793
I've gotta go back and help.

57:03.463 --> 57:06.423
You just take the notebook
and get yourself to safety.

57:06.424 --> 57:08.009
<i>I'll come back for you later.</i>

57:08.385 --> 57:10.011
Go on, do as I say.

57:30.949 --> 57:32.492
Cable!

57:33.034 --> 57:34.576
Jude, go and do what I told you.

57:34.577 --> 57:36.121
It's not safe here anymore.

57:36.538 --> 57:37.664
You hear?

57:38.873 --> 57:40.041
Jude!

57:49.509 --> 57:51.469
No!

58:52.614 --> 58:54.282
Oh, shit.

58:54.699 --> 58:56.242
There goes the neighborhood.

58:57.827 --> 59:01.456
Wait a minute, you're the dude
that saved us back there, right?

59:03.500 --> 59:04.626
You a friend of Cable?

59:06.753 --> 59:08.921
Then I got somethin' for you.

59:08.922 --> 59:10.924
She said I ought
to put it someplace safe.

59:26.773 --> 59:28.274
- Where's Arcane?
- Below.

59:28.733 --> 59:30.527
I'll tell him
I've captured his queen.

59:34.656 --> 59:36.324
Walked right into our hands,
didn't you?

59:37.116 --> 59:38.201
Real smart.

59:38.660 --> 59:40.202
Thanks.

59:40.203 --> 59:42.330
I knew we couldn't rely
on your intelligence.

59:43.957 --> 59:45.250
What I couldn't do for you.

59:48.044 --> 59:49.170
Tell you what...

59:51.047 --> 59:52.297
Tell me where the notebook is

59:52.298 --> 59:54.841
and I'll get you
out of the swamps.

59:54.842 --> 59:56.010
Deal?

59:56.469 --> 59:57.929
I don't mind the swamps.

59:58.805 --> 01:00:00.973
It's the slime that crawls out
from under the rocks

01:00:00.974 --> 01:00:02.307
that turns my stomach.

01:00:02.308 --> 01:00:04.101
Oh, nasty mouth.

01:00:04.102 --> 01:00:05.270
You're a pretty one.

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:10.400
What do you say to that?

01:00:11.651 --> 01:00:12.860
Not much.

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:46.352
Cable!

01:00:47.186 --> 01:00:48.396
Cable.

01:01:11.836 --> 01:01:13.671
<i>Ferret!</i>

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:24.432
Ferret!

01:01:27.894 --> 01:01:29.395
Ferret!

01:01:32.482 --> 01:01:33.899
Maybe we should go
in and check.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.275
No, we go home now.

01:01:35.276 --> 01:01:37.070
- Sir, but...
- Home.

01:02:13.398 --> 01:02:14.691
It's very kind.

01:02:22.365 --> 01:02:23.741
Nice orchid.

01:02:25.702 --> 01:02:29.413
Family Orchidaceae.

01:02:29.414 --> 01:02:31.791
Genus Orchis.

01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:36.087
Over a hundred species here.

01:02:37.296 --> 01:02:40.174
Much beauty in the swamp...

01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:42.844
if you only look.

01:02:52.854 --> 01:02:53.938
Alec?

01:03:05.616 --> 01:03:07.201
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:10.704
It must...

01:03:10.705 --> 01:03:11.831
hurt?

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:15.293
Does it?

01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:21.841
Only when I laugh.

01:03:45.573 --> 01:03:47.074
Have I gone crazy?

01:03:48.868 --> 01:03:50.578
Isn't this a dream?

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:56.417
That's what I keep
asking myself.

01:03:59.754 --> 01:04:02.465
Everything's a dream...

01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:05.384
when you're alone.

01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:12.892
Alec.

01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:15.806
Now.

01:06:16.724 --> 01:06:18.142
No!

01:06:35.952 --> 01:06:40.164
The man who loves
gives hostages to fortune.

01:06:50.883 --> 01:06:51.842
Alec.

01:06:52.635 --> 01:06:53.927
Alec

01:06:53.928 --> 01:06:55.096
Holland.

01:06:55.596 --> 01:06:56.764
You knew, didn't you?

01:06:58.307 --> 01:06:59.725
You knew we'd be caught.

01:07:02.103 --> 01:07:04.771
The only way out...

01:07:04.772 --> 01:07:06.649
is through.

01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:55.031
The occasion for this celebration is,
of course, known to you all.

01:07:55.531 --> 01:07:57.991
We have captured the dragon

01:07:57.992 --> 01:08:01.203
and rescued
the damsel in distress.

01:08:02.038 --> 01:08:04.581
Of course, we regret the loss
of our friend, Ferret.

01:08:04.582 --> 01:08:08.752
His frayed and volatile temper
has destroyed him.

01:08:08.753 --> 01:08:11.254
Nonetheless, we regret his loss,
regret it deeply.

01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:14.883
But to speak the truth,
which is essential,

01:08:14.884 --> 01:08:17.260
regrets are trifles

01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:20.680
when one considers
the grand design.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.599
And we are here tonight
in celebration

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.685
of an event of profound
significance...

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:29.023
The duplication
of the Holland formula.

01:08:35.738 --> 01:08:38.908
For this we must thank
the excellence of one man.

01:08:39.742 --> 01:08:42.327
Dear, dear Bruno,

01:08:42.328 --> 01:08:43.787
who won the notebook

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:46.622
from which we extracted
the final secret.

01:08:46.624 --> 01:08:49.542
And topped it
by capturing the beast.

01:08:59.011 --> 01:09:03.598
<i>So, I propose a toast
to the keystone of our success,</i>

01:09:03.599 --> 01:09:06.267
to our conquest of the world.

01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:08.603
To Bruno.

01:09:08.604 --> 01:09:10.814
Bruno.

01:09:21.242 --> 01:09:22.618
But sir...

01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:25.953
have you tried it out
on a plant yet?

01:09:25.955 --> 01:09:28.165
<i>I mean, when are we going
to see the results?</i>

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:29.542
Tonight.

01:09:30.251 --> 01:09:32.877
<i>Tonight, dear Bruno,
immediately.</i>

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:34.630
<i>But not on a plant.</i>

01:09:35.381 --> 01:09:36.423
Have you taken it?

01:09:37.383 --> 01:09:38.551
No.

01:09:39.093 --> 01:09:43.013
I have given the privilege of taking
the first dose of our formula

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:45.390
to our guest of honor.

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:49.310
<i>Who deserves
the privilege thoroughly.</i>

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:52.104
It is you, dear Bruno

01:09:52.106 --> 01:09:56.152
who will tell us whether or not
the formula works.

01:10:03.617 --> 01:10:05.870
Bruno, what's the matter
with you?

01:10:28.684 --> 01:10:29.894
Calm.

01:10:57.755 --> 01:10:58.714
Calm.

01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:10.726
You...

01:11:24.698 --> 01:11:27.117
What have you done with Cable?

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.703
Holland.

01:11:30.454 --> 01:11:31.956
Holland.

01:11:33.874 --> 01:11:35.167
You're there.

01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:38.254
Brain intact.

01:11:39.046 --> 01:11:43.591
All your abilities, everything,
plus the power...

01:11:43.592 --> 01:11:45.469
the physical strength.

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:49.473
Bring him in.

01:11:52.768 --> 01:11:54.310
Some friend you are.

01:11:54.311 --> 01:11:56.437
Sorry, Bruno,
it's every man for himself,

01:11:56.438 --> 01:11:58.357
and God against all.

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:11.036
Why doesn't Bruno have
your strength?

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.374
We followed
the notebooks religiously.

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:18.960
There can be
no margin for error.

01:12:18.961 --> 01:12:23.131
Why doesn't Bruno there
have your strength?

01:12:23.132 --> 01:12:26.217
Because he never had it.

01:12:26.218 --> 01:12:28.345
No riddles, please.

01:12:29.972 --> 01:12:31.181
You will tell me...

01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:33.684
or you'll Pay-

01:12:34.226 --> 01:12:37.104
And for a very dear agent.

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:40.357
Bring her in.

01:12:46.447 --> 01:12:49.115
The explanation or her.

01:12:49.116 --> 01:12:50.409
Alec, don't!

01:12:55.122 --> 01:12:56.789
Which?

01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:59.168
You don't understand.

01:13:00.127 --> 01:13:01.545
There's nothing hidden.

01:13:02.296 --> 01:13:03.797
<i>No secrets.</i>

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:07.801
<i>The formula works
in so simple a way.</i>

01:13:08.844 --> 01:13:13.432
What Bruno took
was what changed me.

01:13:14.016 --> 01:13:19.145
It only amplifies your essence.

01:13:19.146 --> 01:13:21.648
It simply makes you more

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:25.027
of what you already are.

01:13:26.904 --> 01:13:30.991
Bruno's essence was stupidity...
timidity.

01:13:32.993 --> 01:13:35.287
The formula simply extended,

01:13:35.954 --> 01:13:40.459
amplified this to ridiculous forms
and proportions.

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:44.213
He shrank.

01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:47.591
<i>He shrank to what
he actually was.</i>

01:13:49.802 --> 01:13:53.972
But if the essence is,
let us say, genius,

01:13:54.973 --> 01:13:58.852
then this genius shall be
monumental in body,

01:13:59.186 --> 01:14:01.062
as well as in spirit.

01:14:01.063 --> 01:14:02.144
Is that what you're saying?

01:14:36.682 --> 01:14:37.933
Cable.

01:14:38.725 --> 01:14:39.977
Alec.

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:28.460
Not to be the phenomenon,

01:16:29.127 --> 01:16:31.630
but the thing in itself.

01:16:32.464 --> 01:16:33.840
Eternal.

01:16:34.508 --> 01:16:38.512
Absolute beauty,
absolute strength and power...

01:16:39.513 --> 01:16:43.183
physical and spiritual.

01:16:44.142 --> 01:16:48.605
To <i>be the world and own</i> it.

01:16:50.357 --> 01:16:51.649
Yes?

01:16:51.650 --> 01:16:52.818
Darling,

01:16:53.986 --> 01:16:57.573
tell Karen to bring me
a glass of brandy?

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.271
Reach for it.

01:17:31.356 --> 01:17:33.483
You thrive on the light,
reach for it.

01:17:42.534 --> 01:17:44.161
Alec.

01:18:02.346 --> 01:18:03.764
Come. Come.

01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:13.939
What's the matter with you?

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.066
Go.

01:18:15.067 --> 01:18:16.151
Go, leave me!

01:19:33.854 --> 01:19:34.938
Your arm.

01:20:52.265 --> 01:20:53.517
Listen.

01:20:54.976 --> 01:20:56.561
He's taken the formula.

01:21:11.326 --> 01:21:13.453
Please, there is a way.

01:21:14.955 --> 01:21:16.288
I can't reach it.

01:21:16.289 --> 01:21:18.750
But you twist it to the right
and then to the left.

01:21:21.962 --> 01:21:24.339
<i>Put there in case a guard
ever got shut in by mistake.</i>

01:21:29.177 --> 01:21:30.636
Come on, follow me.

01:21:30.637 --> 01:21:31.888
Come on, follow me!

01:21:49.698 --> 01:21:51.156
You'll have to trust me here

01:21:51.157 --> 01:21:52.658
if you want to survive.

01:21:52.659 --> 01:21:53.869
If you don't...

01:21:54.327 --> 01:21:55.452
Tell us!

01:21:55.453 --> 01:21:57.288
This is the well of the estate

01:21:57.289 --> 01:21:59.874
fed by a... a spring from the bottom
of the great swamp.

01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:01.716
If you follow it,
you'll come out in the swamp.

01:22:03.545 --> 01:22:04.629
Go!

01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:07.215
Watch your step.

01:22:09.676 --> 01:22:11.636
Have a nice trip?

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.640
See you in the fall.

01:23:06.483 --> 01:23:07.776
Alec.

01:23:41.267 --> 01:23:42.477
Alec!

01:25:26.498 --> 01:25:27.916
Behind you.

01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.256
I don't understand.

01:26:59.716 --> 01:27:00.842
It's healed.

01:27:09.893 --> 01:27:11.019
What is it?

01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:16.107
It's over.

01:27:20.945 --> 01:27:22.572
Alec, let me go with you.

01:27:23.448 --> 01:27:25.158
You can start your work again.

01:27:32.498 --> 01:27:33.917
With these?

01:27:36.044 --> 01:27:37.420
I'll be your hands.

01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:41.424
Please?

01:27:43.051 --> 01:27:45.052
You need to heal.

01:27:45.053 --> 01:27:46.930
You need to tell our story.

01:27:48.056 --> 01:27:49.891
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

01:27:54.395 --> 01:27:56.022
Until then...

01:27:58.650 --> 01:28:00.235
I'll always be with you.

01:28:11.329 --> 01:28:12.330
Alec.

01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:18.461
Cable.

01:28:21.589 --> 01:28:22.799
Jude.

01:28:28.471 --> 01:28:29.555
You Okay?

01:28:36.938 --> 01:28:38.189
<i>He told me to come get you.</i>

01:28:40.441 --> 01:28:41.734
He'll be back, though.

01:28:42.610 --> 01:28:43.695
Right?
