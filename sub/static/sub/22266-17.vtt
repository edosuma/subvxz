00:02.001 --> 00:03.459
OLIVER: <i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

00:03.545 --> 00:05.628
Star City needs the Green Arrow.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.205
So I'd like it to be you.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.917
JOHN: <i>The nerve damage in my arm
spread to my back.</i>

00:11.011 --> 00:13.924
<i>And because of the steroid use,
I caused permanent damage.</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:16.848
As soon as you're healed up,
I want you to put that hood back on.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.221
I've been good
for the past two months, good,

00:19.394 --> 00:20.635
but instead of
giving me back the hood,

00:20.729 --> 00:22.061
you've had Cisco make me a new suit.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.021
Ricardo Diaz is pushing Vertigo.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.814
I checked for any
Vertigo-related cases.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.858
They've all been kicked
by Captain Hill.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.186
She did it for Diaz?

00:37.120 --> 00:38.406
The Orchid Bay night market

00:38.497 --> 00:40.830
runs three blocks,
east, west, along R-U-L-O.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.498
About midway down there's an alley.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.917
And that's where Anatoly Knyazev
has been making his drop.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.119
He is not a physical threat,

00:46.213 --> 00:47.545
but the two men
who will be with him are.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.793
I've been to this market.
Lot of civilians there.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.169
Hopefully not in the alley.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.002
We're going to pin him in,
take him out, clean and fast.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.294
Any questions?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.597
This group's a little light
to take on three Bratvas.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.016
Well, Diaz has God knows how much
of the force under his control,

01:00.102 --> 01:01.343
including Captain Hill.

01:01.937 --> 01:04.304
Only cops I'm sure I can trust
are here in this van.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.731
Still, it'd be nice
to have some backup.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.850
We're covered. Trust me.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.778
All right. Two minutes out.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.358
Let's get ready.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.576
Tango's heading into the alley.

<i>Move in.</i>

01:33.176 --> 01:34.508
JOHN:
Looks clean, so far.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.135
Overwatch, any surprises?

01:36.888 --> 01:38.299
Tricky, tricky, Anatoly.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.382
Thermal reads four bogeys,
east alley.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.262
- I'll flank left.
- I'll take right.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.602
Okay, good. Now that we are alone,

01:45.689 --> 01:47.851
I know this might not
exactly be the right time...

01:47.941 --> 01:49.603
You understand that
I'm gonna be punching people

01:49.693 --> 01:50.979
in about 60 seconds, right?

01:51.069 --> 01:52.776
Yes, but it's been about a week
since you decided

01:52.863 --> 01:54.024
that you're not giving
John the hood back,

01:54.114 --> 01:55.104
and I was just wondering
when you were planning

01:55.198 --> 01:56.188
on talking to him about that?

01:56.283 --> 01:59.117
I'm waiting for the right moment.
That moment is not now.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.069
That's a fair point.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.912
Should try apples. It's good season.

and attempt to distribute.

(GROANS)

02:32.361 --> 02:33.522
I see your face.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.729
Maybe not so good for you.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.812
Load him up.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.541
Toss the three stooges
into lockup for processing.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.543
I want Knyazev in interrogation.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.124
CAPTAIN HILL:
What's goin' on here?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.630
We just got Diaz's right-hand man.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.710
Incredible, huh?

03:00.972 --> 03:02.088
Why wasn't I informed?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.764
That was my fault, Captain.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.091
I authorized the operation.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.847
I figured you wouldn't mind
given the stakes.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.520
And we also took the liberty
of calling in DA Armand

03:09.606 --> 03:10.722
to expedite the charges.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.982
There's no sense in waiting, right?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.185
Guess not.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.316
Good work, Lieutenant.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.360
Thank you for letting John and I
backstock you tonight.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.992
'Cause you think we couldn't have
stopped Anatoly otherwise?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.743

Well, try necessity.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.873
while Rene is in the hospital
nursing the wounds you gave him.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.421
Yeah, I told him to stay down.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.873
Matter of fact,
I gave him every chance.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.254
You guys made a move
on our team in the field.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.926

are in the past, all right.

I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor,

04:44.409 --> 04:47.322
but Mr. Knyazev wasn't arrested
pursuant to an arrest warrant.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.862
That's crap. You know it.

on a technicality?

04:52.459 --> 04:54.542

You're under indictment, Mr. Mayor.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.760
for wrongful imprisonment
on top of that?

05:09.768 --> 05:11.475

who's working for Diaz.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.405

he just said that Diaz

08:05.819 --> 08:06.900
So he has another source.

Well, according to Curtis,

08:08.113 --> 08:10.025
Diaz is involved
in an extensive Vertigo operation

08:10.115 --> 08:11.947
and if my math is right,
and it definitely is,

08:12.033 --> 08:14.241
he'll be pulling in
at least a million a day.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.277

08:16.371 --> 08:17.782

10:00.016 --> 10:01.006
Yes!

10:01.935 --> 10:03.221
This is everything
A.R.G.U.S. could find

10:03.311 --> 10:04.927
on the Vertigo trade in Star City.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.598
Yeah, thanks.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.064
It's not free.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.487
I need intel in return.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.193
What kind of intel?

10:17.283 --> 10:19.445
The kind where you tell me
what's going on with you.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.365
Lyla, you know what's going on.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.958
(SIGHS) I'm frustrated that Oliver
strung me along for so long.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.333
Being the Green Arrow,

10:37.762 --> 10:39.253
you know what that meant to me.

10:39.347 --> 10:43.182
But you save this city
every night as Spartan.

10:43.852 --> 10:47.471
It's not like you to care this much
about a title or a hood.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.180
Oliver made a similar point.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.897
- But...
- I don't know.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.527
I just don't know.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.777
This is bothering me
way more than I expected.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.653
I think you owe it to yourself

11:04.122 --> 11:05.954
and to your partnership with Oliver

11:06.583 --> 11:07.949
to figure out why.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.252
Thank you both for coming.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.425
I have to say, Mr. Mayor,
I'm more than a little uncomfortable

11:18.511 --> 11:20.047
meeting with you
without your attorney present.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.879
Well, it's not about the case, Sam.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.347
It's about the two
of you working for Ricardo Diaz.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.434
Who? I'm not sure
I've ever heard that name before.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.182
You're smarter than this.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.226
You're better than this.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.650
Both of you are better than this.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.479
Talk to me.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.445
Less than 24 hours
after you promoted me

11:45.538 --> 11:47.074
to take over Pike's command,

11:47.165 --> 11:48.246
I got an email.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.581
Surveillance photos of my niece,
my father and my sister.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.208
- So he found a way to apply pressure.
- Yeah.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.542
Okay.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.550
My boy has cancer.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.211
Leukemia. Stage four.

12:03.181 --> 12:06.049
Even with the city's insurance,
we couldn't afford the treatments.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.471
I needed Diaz's money.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.723
All right.
We can protect your family.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.223
We can pay for your son's treatments.
This city...

12:14.317 --> 12:15.478
Is bankrupt.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.519
The idea of you
protecting anyone is a joke.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.192
The whole force
is under Diaz's thumb.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.405
Or were you offering your protection
as the Green Arrow?

12:26.120 --> 12:27.736
If I was the Green Arrow,

12:30.041 --> 12:32.829
I don't think you'd wanna
be in this room right now.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.746
I don't think either of you would.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.456
Are we done here?

12:44.806 --> 12:45.842
You are.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.425
You're both fired.
Effective immediately.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.886
- You can't do that.
- If you work for him...

12:53.314 --> 12:54.725
Then you don't work for me.

12:57.527 --> 12:58.517
Get out.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.488
I know you're the Green Arrow,

13:08.329 --> 13:11.322
but this is unlike anything
you've ever gone up against.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.874
Diaz has already beaten you
and you don't even know it.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.831
<i>Still no suspects
in the death of Officer Hurst,</i>

13:19.924 --> 13:22.587
<i>a six-year veteran
with the SCPD found...</i>

13:22.677 --> 13:24.384
Looks like
you've had an exciting day.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.554
I wouldn't call the death
of a respected SCPD officer exciting.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.345
It is when you've been
sitting on the couch all day.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.051
Well, no one's holding you prisoner.
Why don't you get out?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.135
Go get some sun, maybe.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.595
No. Sounds boring.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.931
Helping you with your Diaz situation,

13:37.025 --> 13:38.891
now that sounds interesting to me.

13:39.610 --> 13:43.524
I'm guessing the death of that cop
wasn't exactly random though, was it?

13:44.532 --> 13:45.898
You know something about that?

13:47.076 --> 13:50.035
I know Diaz and he's not
gonna stop at one officer.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.487
Yeah, we figured that.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.035
We sequestered the rest.
They're safe.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.161
Safe where, though?

13:55.251 --> 13:56.412
(CHUCKLES)

13:58.129 --> 13:59.711
How do you expect me
to be like Laurel

13:59.797 --> 14:01.288
when you won't let me act like her?

14:01.382 --> 14:02.623
You want to act like Laurel?

14:03.384 --> 14:05.751
Why don't you do something good, huh?
Get a job, help this city.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.928
I've never had a real job
in my whole life.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.465
I don't even think
I know how to write a resume.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.221
You don't need to write a resume.
You're Laurel Lance, remember?

14:14.479 --> 14:15.890
How well did I do in law school?

14:16.647 --> 14:17.808
Wait here.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.397
I kept all of Laurel's old law books.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.069
Look at that.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.574
Maybe you could start right here.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.405
You wanna home-law-school me?

14:35.500 --> 14:36.911
Beats sitting around
on a couch, doesn't it?

14:37.001 --> 14:38.492
I mean, who knows?
You could give it a shot,

14:38.586 --> 14:41.954
you might just enjoy
doing something good for a change.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.140
Hey, how did it...

14:54.936 --> 14:57.019
I can tell by the look on your face,
won't even ask.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.096
Would you please
give me some good news.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.308
Lyla clued us in on one of
Diaz's suppliers. Marshall Katz.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.688
I'm running location on him now.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.360
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.573
(SIGHS)

15:10.076 --> 15:11.283
- I'll be right back.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.743
Thanks for grabbing
that intel from Lyla.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.200
No problem.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.794
About the hood.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.084
- I'd like to apologize.
- Oliver...

15:26.759 --> 15:28.216
It's just a piece of cloth.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.711
Just like you said.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.382
- You were right.
- I was wrong about a few things.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.054
It's very important
that you know this.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.933
When I asked you to take over for me,
I meant it.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.522
When I put the hood back on and said,

15:42.608 --> 15:44.349
"It's just until
you get back on your feet."

15:44.444 --> 15:46.902
I meant it, but I did
put the hood back on and...

15:48.448 --> 15:49.609
It's a part of me.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.407
It makes me feel

15:53.369 --> 15:56.237
like I'm being
the best version of myself and...

15:57.373 --> 15:58.739
I feel whole.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.536
And I feel complete.

16:01.169 --> 16:04.537
And I really, really hope
that this is making sense.

16:06.716 --> 16:07.706
Yeah.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.334
The hood is part of you now.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.385
I should have been upfront with you.

16:12.597 --> 16:16.887
And I avoided having what I thought
might be a tough conversation.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.722
Well...

16:20.730 --> 16:22.562
I appreciate you
telling me this, Oliver.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.729
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

16:24.192 --> 16:25.353
Thank you.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.858
FELICITY:
Got a location on Katz.

16:31.991 --> 16:32.981
Yeah, let's move.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.659
Baby.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.831
I want some V.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.372
I told you before...

16:46.130 --> 16:47.246
Can't do it.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.632
Only top-grade for my lady.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.803
(CHUCKLES) Well, don't you know
how to make a girl feel special.

16:59.894 --> 17:00.975
We got a problem.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.095
Moore downstairs
spotted one of the masks.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.724
- He's on his way up.
- Go! Do something!

17:04.815 --> 17:06.521
- Get behind us.
- Yeah, no kidding.

17:14.909 --> 17:15.898
Sit.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.411
You're gonna tell us
where you make your Vertigo shipment.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.829
And turn on the Dragon?

17:21.958 --> 17:22.948
You'll have to shoot me, man.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.578
I don't want to waste my arrows.

17:24.669 --> 17:25.910
I think you should.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.624
This punk deserves it.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.253
I'm not nearly
as stingy with my bullets.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.796
(GROANS)

17:33.886 --> 17:35.252
Where do you ship the V from?

17:35.721 --> 17:38.054
(STAMMERING)
I'm too high to die man, please.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.972
Spartan, stand down.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.595
When he tells us
what we need to know.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.769
(STAMMERING) You wouldn't kill me
in front of my lady.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.683
Last chance. Where's the Vertigo?

17:45.773 --> 17:46.763
Spartan!

17:47.441 --> 17:48.682
Stand down!

17:48.776 --> 17:49.766
And what?

17:50.111 --> 17:51.443
Do this your way?

17:51.529 --> 17:52.519
He'll fold.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.525
- Talk.
- Fine.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.074
But you gotta send me
to, like, Mexico, man.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.490
- Diaz will find me.
- (GUN FIRES)

18:03.457 --> 18:05.995
My loyalty is to Diaz, not him.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.803
That was a bust. Get it?

18:18.889 --> 18:20.346
'Cause it's drugs.
It's like a play on words

18:20.433 --> 18:21.890
and it's almost a little fun.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.810
Never mind.
Tough crowd. What happened?

18:24.895 --> 18:26.056
We lost Katz.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.772
(SIGHS)
Oliver, he was gonna talk.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.731
If you had just let me
keep the pressure on him

18:32.820 --> 18:33.936
for one minute longer,

18:34.030 --> 18:37.398
we would be at the location right now
instead of back at square one.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.027
No. He still would have gotten shot

18:39.327 --> 18:40.659
because you picked a fight.

18:41.245 --> 18:44.738
You pulled our focus and you
allowed our target to get killed.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.791
Because you know everything and
I just need to keep my mouth shut.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.247
I'm sorry. What?

18:50.338 --> 18:52.921
Look, guys, we're all just whipped-up

18:53.299 --> 18:55.006
with adrenaline from the field.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.630
And we're gonna catch Diaz.
We always catch the bad guys.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.054
So we're just
going to breathe together.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.176
Inhale...

19:02.642 --> 19:04.929
John, what's going on with you?

19:05.853 --> 19:09.847
First, you were mad at me
because you're not the Green Arrow.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.226
That is...

19:12.526 --> 19:14.939
That is way
out of character for you, my friend.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.855
But I explained myself.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.819
I apologized.

19:20.826 --> 19:21.987
You accepted.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.662
And now you're going to
take a shot at me like that?

19:26.374 --> 19:28.366
I was getting someplace with Katz.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.116
And you

19:30.628 --> 19:31.618
didn't back my play.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.953
'Cause it wasn't working.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.037
No, Oliver!

19:34.590 --> 19:36.456
Because it wasn't your play.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.388
Let me know
when you find the Vertigo.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.227
I need some air.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.455
I already told you. I don't know
where they sequestered the cops.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.753
And if you're here
to put pressure on Lance,

20:15.464 --> 20:16.454
don't.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.415
Because I'm all healed up now.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.508
You want to calm down?

20:21.846 --> 20:23.132
I brought you dinner.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.590
I'm not hungry.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.805
What are you doing here?

20:32.273 --> 20:33.684
Just checking up on things.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.725
Looks like some light reading.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.311
Just trying to maintain my cover.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.443
Don't waste your time.
People like us don't learn the law.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.574
People like us...

20:44.910 --> 20:46.401
We are the law.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.865
You trying to make your daddy proud?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.620
Why would I ever want to do that?

20:54.378 --> 20:56.995
'Cause I used to be like that
with my old man.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.049
Before he died.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.547
It's exhausting trying
to be something you're not.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.006
Oh, so what?

21:10.436 --> 21:12.598
You're gonna tell me
what I'm supposed to be,

21:12.688 --> 21:13.724
is that it?

21:13.814 --> 21:14.895
No.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.900
I see what I like.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.945
I know you're pretending
to be the real Laurel,

21:23.949 --> 21:26.487
but the one standing
in front of me right now...

21:29.288 --> 21:30.995
She don't need changing.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.451
Your fries are getting cold.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.462
(KNOCKS)
Hey.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.336
Hi.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.302
- Everything all right?
- Fine.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.300
I've been out of town for so long,
I just found the gift

21:48.390 --> 21:50.097
you left for me back in December.

21:50.184 --> 21:51.595
I wanted to say thank you.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.723
- You're welcome.
- Funny though,

21:54.188 --> 21:57.181
the same day you delivered it
I also found a security breach

21:57.274 --> 21:58.560
on my computer.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.439
I guess I now know how Cayden James

22:01.529 --> 22:04.112
got a hold
of our nano aluminum amplifier.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.406
I was gonna tell you about that,
Lyla, but, um...

22:07.952 --> 22:09.113
City was at stake.

22:09.203 --> 22:11.115
Yeah, well, the city
is always at stake.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.697
You don't have to lie to your wife
in order to save it.

22:14.542 --> 22:15.828
You're absolutely right.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.369
I'm sorry.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.578
I know.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.213
What brings you by?

22:22.883 --> 22:26.672
Well, Oliver apologized for
stringing me along about the hood.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.508
It was actually a good apology.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.714
Wow.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.966
That's not exactly
Oliver's strong suit.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.050
No, it's not.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.554
But?

22:38.065 --> 22:39.306
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

22:41.443 --> 22:42.604
I don't know.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.027
I thought we cleared the air.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.821
We go out into the field,
we come back and then I...

22:49.618 --> 22:51.655
I just take a piece right out of him.

22:52.705 --> 22:53.866
Over nothing.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.869
It was over nothing.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.628
You're right,
there's something wrong.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.749
And I'm worried that
when I find out what it is,

23:05.843 --> 23:06.924
I'm not gonna like it.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.718
Well, from everything you've told me,

23:09.096 --> 23:10.803
there's not a lot to like these days.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.634
The team breaking up,

23:12.725 --> 23:15.388
Rene's in the hospital,
Diaz is running rampant.

23:16.854 --> 23:21.189
Maybe the reason Oliver holding on
to the hood bothered you so much,

23:21.984 --> 23:23.350
is because you think
none of these things

23:23.444 --> 23:25.652
would've happened if you had
been the one still wearing it.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.154
Seriously,
thanks for helping us out here.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.360
I mean, anything for Dinah.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.453
Maybe I was a little
worried about you too.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.780
I'll be fine.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.036
Just hate leaving the city
to be overrun by a bunch

23:39.126 --> 23:41.163
of corrupt cops and
vigilantes.

23:42.296 --> 23:44.083
Don't you think there's a little bit
of a difference between

23:44.173 --> 23:45.505
bent cops and vigilantes.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.416
None that I can see.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.167
They're both criminals, right?

23:50.596 --> 23:51.677
Yeah.

23:55.392 --> 23:56.382
Hey.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.226
Listen, do you think
we could have the room?

24:01.982 --> 24:04.224
Yeah, yeah, of course.

24:09.698 --> 24:12.406
- Get some air?
- Yeah, I did.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.319
And with it, some clarity.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.372
Oliver, it's totally within
your rights.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.673
To keep the hood, it's yours.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.632
You're right, my frustration
was never with the uniform.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.299
It was with the man underneath it.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.599
I don't understand.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.682
I didn't either, not at first.

24:46.694 --> 24:47.730
(SIGHS)

24:47.903 --> 24:49.815
I so appreciated your apology.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.364
But something about it gnawed at me.

24:56.245 --> 24:59.989
That you needed to be
the Green Arrow,

25:00.374 --> 25:02.787
that it completed you.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.160
This was supposed to be about

25:05.921 --> 25:07.253
saving the city.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.589
Helping the people.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.336
Not ourselves.

25:11.427 --> 25:12.713
I know that.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.930
It's a little too dangerous.

25:18.142 --> 25:21.761
And I've lost just a little too much
along the way for it

25:21.854 --> 25:23.766
- to be about that.
- But yet here you are.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.649
You've gotten married, raising a son,

25:27.735 --> 25:29.226
- you've become the mayor.
- So what?

25:29.319 --> 25:32.812
So, Oliver, you were never
supposed to stretch yourself so thin.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.281
And in so many different directions,

25:35.659 --> 25:37.776
that the people suffer.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.285
We have been in tough spots before.

25:41.415 --> 25:43.407
We have with a team.

25:43.625 --> 25:47.995
Even before Curtis, Rene and Dinah,
there was Roy, there was Thea,

25:48.088 --> 25:50.296
but, Oliver, the way you lead

25:50.382 --> 25:54.296
alienates everyone and everything
around you, look.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.965
Putting the team under surveillance
was a mistake.

26:01.101 --> 26:04.060
We had an opportunity to save
the Vigilante.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.887
You made a different call.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.768
The same with Laurel and the money.

26:07.858 --> 26:11.522
When did all of these
just magically become my decisions?

26:12.071 --> 26:16.361
I seem to remember you right there
next to me.

26:16.450 --> 26:20.239
Begging you to exercise restraint,
caution, Oliver.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.743
But that's not you, you have changed,
you have grown so much

26:23.832 --> 26:26.950
and it's been my honor,
it's been my privilege to watch you.

26:27.044 --> 26:29.127
But Oliver, you're still you

26:29.213 --> 26:31.000
and if you're just
doing this for you,

26:31.090 --> 26:33.002
- like you just admitted...
- I didn't say I was doing it

26:33.092 --> 26:35.254
- just for myself.
- If this isn't 100%

26:35.344 --> 26:36.710
for our city,

26:36.970 --> 26:39.132
then you are not the hero

26:39.389 --> 26:40.596
that it deserves.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.509
And you never will be.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.680
Ricardo Diaz

26:49.399 --> 26:50.640
has...

26:51.693 --> 26:56.188
God knows, how much of our city
in his grip,

26:56.740 --> 27:01.235
and you're picking now
to lecture me or to whine

27:01.328 --> 27:02.990
about not getting a promotion?

27:03.080 --> 27:05.493
Promotion, this isn't about
a promotion, man.

27:05.582 --> 27:08.620
This is about you and Diaz,
you still can't see it.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.327
- See what?
- He's already won, Oliver,

27:11.421 --> 27:14.084
he has the city wired
and it happened under your watch.

27:14.174 --> 27:17.008
He showed up
while you were the Green Arrow!

27:17.302 --> 27:19.089
You bought drugs from him, John.

27:19.179 --> 27:22.422
You funded what he is doing right now!

27:22.766 --> 27:25.179
The entire time I put you
in that hood

27:25.269 --> 27:27.431
and you hid having a drug problem.

27:27.521 --> 27:29.808
And I was putting
my body through hell

27:31.191 --> 27:34.980
- for the sake of our city.
- No, you put the team at risk

27:35.070 --> 27:36.311
by lying!

27:36.405 --> 27:39.113
I had to dive off a bridge
to save Rene's life,

27:39.283 --> 27:42.026
because you were in the field,
you weren't 100%,

27:42.119 --> 27:43.235
and nobody knew it.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.570
You really wanna
bring up Rene right now

27:45.664 --> 27:48.407
when he is still hospitalized
for the beating that you put on him?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.116
We were in the field against

27:50.210 --> 27:53.669
Dinah, Curtis and Rene,
he pulls a gun on me.

27:53.755 --> 27:56.623
- You think he gave me a choice?
- I think that you leave

27:56.717 --> 27:57.833
a trail of bodies

27:57.926 --> 28:00.088
every damn place that you go.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.593
Sure, you've changed.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.888
But what comfort is that to William?

28:08.896 --> 28:11.730
Whose mother is dead because
of the bad decisions

28:11.815 --> 28:12.931
that you've made.

28:25.996 --> 28:27.703
My trail of bodies

28:30.125 --> 28:32.117
doesn't include my own brother.

28:45.599 --> 28:47.932
(BOTH GRUNTING AND YELLING)

28:52.731 --> 28:54.597
(BOTH GRUNTING)

29:05.827 --> 29:07.034
FELICITY: Stop!

29:07.120 --> 29:09.362
What are you two doing?
That's enough.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.706
Have you two gone
completely over the edge?

29:16.964 --> 29:19.377
Diaz is running through the city
like a cancer

29:19.466 --> 29:24.461
and you two are in here
doing what exactly?

29:27.724 --> 29:28.714
Okay.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.554
This is what's going to happen.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.474
I am gonna go back to work,

29:33.563 --> 29:36.772
looking for the needle
that is Diaz's Vertigo operation

29:36.858 --> 29:38.895
in the city's haystack
and the two of you

29:38.986 --> 29:41.103
are gonna pull your heads
out of your asses!

29:51.581 --> 29:53.994
- She's right.
- She usually is.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.003
Sorry I punched you, Oliver.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.216
Sorry I punched you back.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.135
For what it's worth,

30:10.392 --> 30:12.224
I know you've done a lot of good,

30:13.645 --> 30:16.513
I know lately it seems like everyone's
been questioning your leadership.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.856
Me included.

30:21.069 --> 30:22.901
Found the location of Diaz's
Vertigo operation,

30:22.988 --> 30:25.196
have you two found
any shred of sanity?

30:25.574 --> 30:26.564
Perhaps?

30:30.120 --> 30:31.361
Let's go.

30:40.922 --> 30:42.788
So he just drops it casually,

30:42.883 --> 30:45.091
"I hate vigilantes."
Not "hate" but "hate,"

30:45.177 --> 30:47.794
like capital letters,
"hates vigilantes."

30:48.597 --> 30:49.633
This is Paul all over again.

30:50.432 --> 30:51.923
Well, that's kind of a leap.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.555
Paul divorced me because
I was a vigilante.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.055
Curtis, you're getting
ahead of yourself.

30:56.146 --> 30:57.808
Yeah, you're right,
he's not gonna break up with me.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.764
- That's the spirit.
- He's going to arrest me.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.440
I know I'm the last person
who should be giving you

31:01.526 --> 31:02.607
relationship advice.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.935
Yet you're about to give me some.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.736
It's more of a life philosophy.

31:06.156 --> 31:07.522
Just live in the moment.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.323
Because you can only see
the step that's ahead of you,

31:09.409 --> 31:10.945
you don't know what's
at the end of the road.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.077
(BEEPS)

31:15.123 --> 31:17.285
Someone just set off
one of my proximity alerts,

31:17.709 --> 31:18.916
make that some-many.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.413
All headed toward the front door.

31:20.504 --> 31:21.620
- How did they find us?
- Who?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.375
Diaz's men, they're about
to hit us from the west,

31:23.465 --> 31:24.751
the north, the south,
they're about to hit us

31:24.841 --> 31:26.548
- from every angle.
- I know.

31:28.178 --> 31:30.420
I'm sorry, but we can't defeat Diaz.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.964
We tried and we failed.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.216
No!

31:36.853 --> 31:38.219
You stay with Curtis.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.521
Curtis.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.408
I count 13 bogies in this den alone,
heavily armed.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.288
OLIVER:
No Diaz.

32:02.796 --> 32:05.163
Got at least 20 million
of Vertigo here. He's gonna miss it.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.089
The only way that we'll make it
out of here

32:07.175 --> 32:08.461
is if we trust each other.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.507
We've been through worse, Oliver.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.589
I'm not sure that we have, John.

32:15.350 --> 32:16.636
You're quarterback.

32:17.644 --> 32:18.634

32:20.730 --> 32:21.720

Okay? Hold on.

Actually that's a lie,
I think my ribs are broken.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.158
- You were shot point blank.
- No!

33:25.545 --> 33:27.081
- You're...
- It's not what it looks like.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.917
Okay, it is what it looks like.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.092
Okay, go.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.466
Place is bigger than expected,
how many more explosives do we have?

33:43.355 --> 33:44.971
- JOHN: <i>I'm all out.</i>
- Then we improvise.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.852
Vertigo's flammable
in its liquid state.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.184
- Headed there now.
- You won't make it.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.438
Not alone I won't.

34:16.679 --> 34:17.966
It's just like John Wayne,

"It's better to have loved and lost
than to never have loved at all."

34:20.183 --> 34:21.889
Are we getting out of here or not?

34:23.853 --> 34:25.889
Okay. There's an opening
on the east side of the building.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.893
You know there is no opening
on the east side of the building!

34:27.983 --> 34:29.190

35:10.525 --> 35:12.437
Judging by the burn radius
of the warehouse,

35:12.527 --> 35:14.393
looks like
we got all of Diaz's stash.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.653
Oliver, I'm really sorry
about what I said.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.073
You apologized already, John,
so did I.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.361
I know.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.072
I know.

35:30.712 --> 35:33.420
But what I said about the calls
you've made.

35:34.424 --> 35:35.790
Where you've brought us.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.501

I just can't shake them.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.215
What, you can't shake that you said it?

35:41.306 --> 35:42.922
I can't shake that it's true.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.605
even when my heart told me
there was a better way.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.770
I trusted it, I trusted you.

35:55.737 --> 35:59.230
But the inescapable truth
is that people have lost faith

35:59.324 --> 36:00.531
in your leadership.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.580
Truth is, Oliver, you have become
a better man.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.667
But with your focus split...

36:13.004 --> 36:14.620
A worse leader.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.008
The Green Arrow allows you
to become the best version

36:19.094 --> 36:20.426
of yourself and I respect that.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.844
I respect you.

36:23.682 --> 36:26.015
But if I'm gonna be
the best version of myself,

36:28.061 --> 36:29.051
Oliver,

36:32.816 --> 36:34.148
it can't be with you.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.988
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

36:48.373 --> 36:49.454
John.

36:52.669 --> 36:53.830
Don't do this.

37:04.431 --> 37:05.922
Thank you so much
for helping me get Zoe

37:06.015 --> 37:08.098
- up for school.
- Yeah, sure.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.267
Just don't understand
how a girl so small

37:10.353 --> 37:11.719
generates this much mess.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.560
You know I actually
don't mind tidying up.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.936
Kind of like it.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.733
Keeps my mind off of things

37:18.820 --> 37:21.233
like the fact that my boyfriend
is going to break up with me,

37:21.322 --> 37:23.188
because he found out I'm a vigilante,

37:23.283 --> 37:25.195
and he hates vigilantes.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.485
So he is your boyfriend.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.287
My mind works in hyperbole.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.448
(SIGHS)

37:32.542 --> 37:34.033
Ignoring for a second

37:34.127 --> 37:38.872
the operational risk of having
a cop know your identity.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.173
Do you regret him knowing the truth?

37:42.510 --> 37:44.001
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

37:45.180 --> 37:47.513
Besides the fact that it means
ending our relationship,

37:47.599 --> 37:49.340
- I don't.
- Well...

37:50.852 --> 37:52.184
Then it was worth it.

37:57.150 --> 37:58.607
Speak of the devil.

37:58.860 --> 38:00.476
- It's Nick.
- Wait, what?

38:04.157 --> 38:06.149
- Lieutenant Drake.
- Not looking for me,

38:06.242 --> 38:07.278
I assume?

38:07.577 --> 38:09.739
No, but I'm glad you're here.

38:10.330 --> 38:11.741
Hill just canned me.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.406
And you.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.958
And the rest of us,
anyone who wasn't dirty.

38:16.336 --> 38:18.419
Last thing she did before
clearing out her desk.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.417
We're gonna fight this, Nick, okay?
Don't worry.

38:21.424 --> 38:22.540
Come in.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.922
I should probably find
a reason to leave.

38:29.891 --> 38:31.223
See you later.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.387
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.722
- You go first.
- Okay.

38:38.817 --> 38:39.978
(CHUCKLES)

38:41.402 --> 38:42.518
Listen.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.565
I know

38:44.656 --> 38:46.739
you're not a fan of vigilantes.

38:47.534 --> 38:49.867
So, I get it, if you wanna...

38:50.662 --> 38:51.903
Step away from this.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.909
Curtis, I just lost my job
for being a clean cop.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.160
I know.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.618
With the department compromised,
maybe vigilantism is the only way

38:58.711 --> 39:00.623
to take back the city, I don't know.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.167
To be honest,

39:03.258 --> 39:05.466
I don't know how I feel
about vigilantes.

39:07.929 --> 39:11.468
But I do know how I feel about you.

39:19.274 --> 39:20.481
You okay?

39:25.613 --> 39:26.979
I know it had to be done.

39:29.659 --> 39:30.695
(SIGHS)

39:35.707 --> 39:37.664
You had to do this your way.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.208
I wish I knew what this was,

39:43.673 --> 39:44.754
Lyla.

39:47.969 --> 39:50.131
I know I wanna keep
fighting for the city.

39:52.974 --> 39:55.261
I just don't know
what that looks like on my own.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.555
Maybe you don't do it alone.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.229
Maybe you do it with me.

40:06.571 --> 40:07.687
Here.

40:12.452 --> 40:13.613
A.R.G.U.S.?

40:14.871 --> 40:17.363
I've got people
breaking into my office,

40:18.124 --> 40:19.285
stealing stuff.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.293
And really...

40:23.838 --> 40:25.704
I could use an extra pair of hands.

40:38.853 --> 40:39.969
Hey.

40:43.566 --> 40:44.898
I know it's rough.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.442
But you'll always have me.

40:48.363 --> 40:49.774
I'm not going anywhere.

40:56.788 --> 40:57.778
What's up, Quentin?

40:57.872 --> 40:59.989
<i>Turn on the TV, any channel.</i>

41:05.380 --> 41:08.839
<i>Obviously the Mayor terminated us
to impede the prosecution</i>

41:08.925 --> 41:10.336
<i>of his activities as the Green Arrow.</i>

41:11.219 --> 41:13.461
<i>What Oliver Queen did
is an impeachable offense.</i>

41:14.013 --> 41:15.970
<i>It was a gross overstep of power.</i>

41:16.349 --> 41:19.183
<i>Our Mayor should be held
accountable for his actions.</i>

41:19.268 --> 41:20.258
<i>Thank you.</i>

41:20.353 --> 41:22.219
Armand said that was your idea.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.978
Looks like reading those law books
really paid off.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.270
Guess I was wrong.

41:33.282 --> 41:35.023
You were right about
something else though.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.068
I'm not changing who I really am.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.199
I have one last surprise for you.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.796
There is one left.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.424
And I know just how to use it.
