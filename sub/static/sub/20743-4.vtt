35:41.906 --> 35:44.739
You were a little boy once.

35:48.779 --> 35:50.838
You ever done anything good in this life?

35:52.583 --> 35:57.782
One honest moment of love
in all this darkness?

36:00.258 --> 36:01.282
I have.

36:04.629 --> 36:06.290
And it was glorious.

36:06.364 --> 36:07.831
Tell it, Brother Steven.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.155
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

36:11.769 --> 36:12.758
(DOG BARKING)

36:17.542 --> 36:19.840
Happy to cut his nuts off,

36:20.311 --> 36:22.541
take his eyeballs, swap 'em out.

36:23.714 --> 36:25.181
Whatever it takes.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.842
I want every name.

36:32.823 --> 36:34.347

36:42.867 --> 36:43.856
Kill me.

36:44.335 --> 36:46.428
I don't give a shit.

Oh, you should give a shit, friend.

(CLEARS THROAT)

37:11.329 --> 37:14.662
Uh, sorry, I know you don't like surprises.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.459
SONYA: It's all right. Come on in.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.878
Yeah.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.546
I got a little drunk.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.918
You'll have to quit smoking now.

37:37.822 --> 37:40.222
Yeah, funny. (LAUGHS)

37:41.759 --> 37:42.885
Good memory.

37:45.663 --> 37:46.755
So?

37:48.966 --> 37:50.661
(CLEARS THROAT) I, uh...

37:52.370 --> 37:54.497
I should've called you from the hospital.

37:56.907 --> 37:59.205
It was important to you.

38:00.511 --> 38:01.637
I knew that.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.775
Why didn't you?

38:08.753 --> 38:09.879
I don't know.

38:13.057 --> 38:18.290
I didn't really expect to have this reaction.

38:30.408 --> 38:32.376
He was your brother, Jack.

38:34.445 --> 38:38.905
Yeah. He was my brother.

38:41.452 --> 38:42.885
What did you take from the room?

38:43.988 --> 38:47.617
Nothing. Just more crap.

38:55.399 --> 38:56.991
It's a good thing he's gone.

38:59.103 --> 39:00.832
Can you feel it?

39:04.108 --> 39:05.632
No.

39:10.247 --> 39:11.771
Well, it is.

39:13.784 --> 39:17.914
(SIGHS) It is. It's over.

39:28.599 --> 39:31.193
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

39:40.611 --> 39:41.669
Wait.

39:42.146 --> 39:44.046
There you go.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.361
- You sure?
- Yes.

44:05.009 --> 44:07.477
I'm not going to hurt you, Eleanor.

44:08.245 --> 44:09.837
I need you.

44:19.156 --> 44:21.181
What happened in El Paso?

44:22.359 --> 44:26.728
Yovani was inappropriate.
He touched me.

44:27.464 --> 44:28.988
How did he touch you?

44:32.136 --> 44:34.195
In a way I didn't want to be touched.

44:35.439 --> 44:38.806
So, you kill him?

44:42.446 --> 44:43.538
Yeah.

44:45.282 --> 44:47.773
I told him not to touch you.

44:49.953 --> 44:51.352
He did.

44:53.590 --> 44:57.458
I was worried you would think
that I betrayed you.

44:58.328 --> 44:59.488
No.

45:01.632 --> 45:04.430
I have something you want.

45:06.336 --> 45:08.770
That means I have you.

45:11.241 --> 45:13.607
Is the banker a problem?

45:14.311 --> 45:15.437
No.

I think I can fix it.
