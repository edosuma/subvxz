01:18.395 --> 01:20.320
I must.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.988
Have. That. Toy.

01:22.141 --> 01:23.807
What, are you serious?

01:23.900 --> 01:25.250
Of course I'm serious,
I'm a child

01:25.477 --> 01:26.977
and I just saw a commercial!

01:27.070 --> 01:28.161
Or maybe you don't want me
to have

01:28.255 --> 01:29.421
a happy American Christmas.

01:29.573 --> 01:31.423
Of course I do.
But do you really not

01:31.575 --> 01:33.408
see that you're crassly
manifesting

01:33.502 --> 01:36.428
the very consumerism on
which Christmas is built?

01:37.840 --> 01:39.414
Chris, can you please
put the dog out?

01:39.433 --> 01:40.657
Yes, sir!

01:40.676 --> 01:43.084
(grunts)

01:43.104 --> 01:44.661
Thank you, Chris.

01:44.680 --> 01:45.604
Hey!

01:45.831 --> 01:47.606
It's very cold out here.

01:47.833 --> 01:49.683
Okay, everyone, time to leave
for the traditional

01:49.835 --> 01:51.593
town tree lighting ceremony.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.094
What's happening now?
I can't hear her.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.114
Sweet. Tree lighting.

01:55.265 --> 01:57.507
(clucks tongue)
Guess that means it's showtime.

01:57.526 --> 01:58.892
Wait, what is this?

01:58.953 --> 02:00.119
Oh, nothing.

02:00.346 --> 02:01.436
Just my own tradition

02:01.530 --> 02:03.363
of putting
four dozen hard-boiled eggs

02:03.457 --> 02:05.532
in a Kroger bag and passing
them out at the tree lighting.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.276
Okay, we get it, Meg,
you're dark and different.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.871
Wow, Meg really is
dark and different.

02:11.023 --> 02:12.947
Yeah, they call me
"Meg the Egg."

02:12.967 --> 02:14.782
'Cause of my big bag of eggs.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.951
(chuckles) I hope you guys
don't start calling me that,

02:16.971 --> 02:18.453
but you can if you want to.

02:18.547 --> 02:20.288
Oh, is this
the "Meg the Egg" thing?

02:20.382 --> 02:22.224
Yeah, no one's
on board with that.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.984
Whoa, Quahog!

02:32.211 --> 02:33.894
Whoa, there! Whoa!

02:33.988 --> 02:35.896
Whoa.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.547
Welcome, one and all,

02:37.566 --> 02:40.400
to the annual
tree lighting ceremony.

02:40.552 --> 02:42.161
All right, Meg the Egg!

02:42.388 --> 02:44.329
Huevo me!

02:45.666 --> 02:47.315
Mmm, perfect yolks this year.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.168
(mouth full):
Four and a half minutes.

02:49.395 --> 02:52.320
Now, don't you worry, y'all will
have a chance to line up

02:52.339 --> 02:55.749
and meet Santy and let him
know what dry goods you need.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.734
And right here
in front of City Hall,

02:57.827 --> 03:00.921
I'm placing this wooden nativity
scene that I whittled myself

03:01.015 --> 03:03.348
from a beech tree
what was rat-tailed

03:03.575 --> 03:07.686
by lightning in the recent
meteorological electricities.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.174
Oh, great, just what we need.

03:13.268 --> 03:15.268
A religious display
on government property.

03:15.421 --> 03:18.255
Can't believe this is what
my tax dollars are paying for.

03:18.273 --> 03:21.015
(scoffs) Last I heard, you
never paid taxes in your life.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.202
Only 'cause I've never made
enough money! Ha!

03:23.429 --> 03:25.946
Brian, I can laugh
at a lot of things,

03:26.098 --> 03:28.782
but Jesus Christ is
not two of them.

03:28.934 --> 03:31.025
Yeah, come on, Brian,
it's Christmas.

03:31.119 --> 03:33.378
Have an egg.
Enjoy yourself.

03:33.530 --> 03:36.106
Okay, now to light
the Christmas tree

03:36.199 --> 03:37.941
by telling this child's toy

03:37.960 --> 03:40.034
my mother's maiden name.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.679
Abernathy.

03:44.466 --> 03:45.873
(crowd cheering)

03:45.968 --> 03:48.727
Yay!
Very holiday data information!

03:51.565 --> 03:53.790
I guess Santa's
getting ready to rack up

03:53.809 --> 03:55.809
those frequent flyer miles, huh?

03:55.961 --> 03:57.753
Yeah, we all read
your tweets, Joe.

03:57.755 --> 03:59.238
Smash that "like" button.

03:59.465 --> 04:02.032
Hey, check it out, Peter,
it's Ebenezer Pooch.

04:03.986 --> 04:05.893
We should mess with him
by putting only

04:05.913 --> 04:07.579
Christmas songs on the jukebox.

04:07.806 --> 04:09.473
Cleveland, I got just the song.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.065
("Life Is a Highway"
by Tom Cochrane playing)

04:11.159 --> 04:13.085
♪<i> Life is a highway</i> ♪

04:13.236 --> 04:15.087
♪<i> I want to ride it...</i> ♪

04:15.314 --> 04:16.904
Wait, what the hell is this?

04:16.924 --> 04:19.407
Only the best
Christmas song ever.

04:19.501 --> 04:21.760
I tell you, no matter
when I hear this baby,

04:21.911 --> 04:23.820
I start smelling pine.

04:23.913 --> 04:25.413
Joe, this is not a holiday song.

04:25.507 --> 04:27.248
He never once
mentions Christmas!

04:27.268 --> 04:29.509
No, it's about Santa.

04:29.661 --> 04:31.085
All night long.

04:31.105 --> 04:34.164
On the highway...
delivering presents.

04:34.182 --> 04:36.016
The video takes place
in a field!

04:36.110 --> 04:37.276
In what is clearly summer!

04:37.427 --> 04:39.260
Quagmire,
many parts of the world are

04:39.280 --> 04:40.779
arid during the holy season.

04:40.930 --> 04:42.948
Including where Jesus was born.

04:43.175 --> 04:44.858
Or perhaps
the singer's Australian.

04:45.010 --> 04:45.951
He's not Australian!

04:46.102 --> 04:48.120
He name-checks Vancouver
in the song!

04:48.347 --> 04:51.031
A guy from Australia can't
know where Vancouver is?

04:51.125 --> 04:52.624
Feels kind of racist.

04:52.776 --> 04:54.126
Mm-hmm.

04:54.353 --> 04:56.369
Damn it, Joe! We're supposed
to be annoying Brian!

04:56.463 --> 04:57.704
Not this!

04:57.798 --> 04:58.872
Oh, okay, I get it.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.690
Everybody pile on the one person

05:00.709 --> 05:03.318
who actually sees the truth
about Christmas.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.545
You know, you guys know all--
what this holiday

05:05.639 --> 05:08.956
is all about, right?
It's all about this.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.475
The world's smallest violin?

05:10.627 --> 05:11.959
A scrotal massage?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.145
"Ah, just like
in the old country"?

05:13.296 --> 05:15.872
We're more word people
than gesture people.

05:15.891 --> 05:16.890
No! Money!

05:16.984 --> 05:18.633
It's all about money!

05:18.652 --> 05:20.819
Is Christmas really so awful?

05:20.970 --> 05:23.655
I don't know, I-I just--
I can't stand how everyone buys

05:23.807 --> 05:25.640
into this annual mass hypnosis.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.736
I mean, like, do not even get me
started on Christmas caroling.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.978
No, go ahead. I'm listening.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.313
No, that's-that's what I mean.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.648
Like, do not get me started.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.575
Trust me, you,
you will be here all night.

05:35.727 --> 05:37.819
I've got time. I'm officially
getting you started.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.004
-Name one thing.
-(exhales)

05:39.231 --> 05:40.580
I mean, where do I start?

05:40.732 --> 05:42.156
The things I have to say

05:42.176 --> 05:44.734
about caroling. It's like,
how long have you got?

05:44.828 --> 05:46.511
I've got all night, no one
to go home to-- let's hear it.

05:46.738 --> 05:49.255
Yeah, okay... well, I mean,
first there's the...

05:49.408 --> 05:50.832
-you know, the singing.
-(imitates buzzer)

05:50.851 --> 05:53.076
You know what, screw you guys!

05:53.095 --> 05:54.911
All right, screw Frosty!

05:54.930 --> 05:56.188
Screw Vince Guaraldi!

05:56.357 --> 05:58.357
Screw both Rankin and Bass!

05:59.843 --> 06:03.753
Well, I'm with him on Rankin,
but, come on, what did Bass do?

06:03.772 --> 06:06.013
-(tires squealing)
-(horns honking)

06:06.033 --> 06:08.091
Stupid Christmas.

06:08.184 --> 06:10.202
What kind of name is
Blitzen anyway, what is that?

06:10.353 --> 06:12.612
That's like-- that's not
a name... it's a football...

06:12.764 --> 06:14.664
something.

06:16.618 --> 06:18.085
-(horn honks)
-(gasps)

06:19.028 --> 06:21.004
Aah! Son of a bitch!

06:23.032 --> 06:25.425
(crashes)

06:35.971 --> 06:38.138
Oh, crap.
Why couldn't I have hit

06:38.290 --> 06:40.649
the court-ordered menorah
instead?

06:42.051 --> 06:43.485
MORT:
Thank you!

06:50.244 --> 06:52.226
Aw, crap, this is bad,
this is bad.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.288
After all I said, they-they'll
probably call this a hate crime.

06:56.566 --> 06:59.459
I've just got
to hide the evidence.

07:02.330 --> 07:05.090
Ah, I wish someone was here
to try to take this from me,

07:05.317 --> 07:07.909
'cause I'd be all like...
(growling)

07:08.003 --> 07:10.303
No way, you! This is mine!

07:12.415 --> 07:14.749
Now where can I hide
an old, banged-up car

07:14.843 --> 07:16.751
where it'll just blend right in?

07:16.845 --> 07:19.062
(jet engine whirring)

07:28.115 --> 07:29.781
I knew this would work.

07:29.933 --> 07:31.450
Especially after
that last flight I took.

07:31.601 --> 07:34.177
Spirit Airlines is
now boarding group whatever.

07:34.237 --> 07:36.179
Just start punching
until you're on an airplane.

07:36.198 --> 07:38.498
(crowd shouting, clamoring)

07:43.188 --> 07:44.354
<i>Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

07:44.447 --> 07:47.207
<i> Our top story:</i>
<i> Ho-ho-homeless man</i>

07:47.359 --> 07:48.783
<i> found dead in local alleyway.</i>

07:48.802 --> 07:51.711
<i> But first we're joined</i>
<i> live by Mayor Wild West</i>

07:51.805 --> 07:54.364
<i> outside City Hall,</i>
<i> who reports that the town</i>

07:54.457 --> 07:57.291
<i> nativity scene he personally</i>
<i> whittled has gone missing.</i>

07:57.385 --> 08:00.220
<i> Mayor West, what can you</i>
<i>tell us about the disappearance</i>

08:00.372 --> 08:02.463
<i> and also about</i>
<i> my contested parking ticket,</i>

08:02.557 --> 08:05.132
<i> and I'll remind you the tree</i>
<i> limb was blocking the sign.</i>

08:05.152 --> 08:07.468
<i> That tree was a hardwood,</i>
<i> Mr. Tucker,</i>

08:07.488 --> 08:09.988
<i> and there wouldn't have been</i>
<i> a leaf on it till mid-May.</i>

08:10.215 --> 08:11.806
<i> The printing</i>
<i> of the restricted times</i>

08:11.825 --> 08:13.658
<i> was also faded,</i>
<i> and as to the investigation?</i>

08:13.885 --> 08:16.495
<i> Whoever took that</i>
<i> nativity scene best sleep</i>

08:16.722 --> 08:19.480
<i> with one eye open,</i>
<i> 'cause I'm on your trail.</i>

08:19.500 --> 08:21.407
<i> And I'm gonna hunt you down</i>
<i> like the mighty</i>

08:21.502 --> 08:25.712
<i>grizzly hunts a Slim Jim left on</i>
<i>the dashboard of a Ford Taurus.</i>

08:26.990 --> 08:29.156
<i> I regret</i>
<i> that the West has changed.</i>

08:29.251 --> 08:31.693
Ah, now I want a Slim Jim.
Slim Jim, anyone?

08:31.695 --> 08:34.328
Slim Jim? Never google
what's in it? Slim Jim?

08:34.422 --> 08:36.573
That's rather odd.
Who would steal...

08:36.591 --> 08:38.350
(high-pitched):
a nativity scene?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.171
Want to tell me
what's going on, champ?

08:44.191 --> 08:45.690
(laughing):
What? Nothing.

08:45.842 --> 08:48.084
Brian, I can tell when you're
lying, because your voice always

08:48.177 --> 08:49.844
gets high at the end
of your sentences.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.104
That's nuts,
you don't know what you're

08:51.256 --> 08:52.697
(high-pitched):
talking about!

08:52.924 --> 08:54.741
Okay, fine!

08:59.355 --> 09:02.374
Yes, it was me. I destroyed
the nativity scene with my car.

09:02.601 --> 09:04.325
But you've got to keep
your mouth shut about this.

09:04.378 --> 09:07.028
I could be in a lot of trouble.
I already hid the evidence.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.487
Did you at least do it right?

09:08.549 --> 09:09.363
You burned all the pieces

09:09.383 --> 09:10.715
and sank your car in a lake?

09:10.867 --> 09:12.609
No, I parked it in the
Spirit Airlines parking lot...

09:12.702 --> 09:14.219
Oh, because they all
drive crappy cars.

09:14.370 --> 09:16.221
That's smart, that's smart.
Well, not to worry.

09:16.372 --> 09:17.722
You and I will just leave town

09:17.949 --> 09:19.040
and start a new life together.

09:19.134 --> 09:20.225
What? What are you talking...?

09:20.452 --> 09:21.951
Look, we could buy
a house in Cincinnati

09:22.045 --> 09:23.636
for $43,000.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.789
Stewie, I'm not leaving town--
Wait, what, seriously?

09:25.807 --> 09:28.049
Yes, pretty big. Three bedrooms.
Hardwood floors.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.068
For $43,000? That's insane.

09:30.295 --> 09:31.961
-We could just pay that off.
-I know. You could have

09:32.055 --> 09:33.405
that office you've
always wanted and we'd still

09:33.556 --> 09:35.148
have an extra room for the baby.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.634
-What?
-Or-or a craft room.

09:37.652 --> 09:39.727
-(knocking)
-Oh, crap, Who's that?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.746
Howdy, folks.

09:41.973 --> 09:44.732
Just seeing if I might ask
y'all a few questions.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.400
Hey, you're the man from the TV!

09:46.494 --> 09:49.379
Please come in,
I'm the man from the couch.

09:50.315 --> 09:51.831
Okay, quick, I need an alibi.

09:51.983 --> 09:53.091
Okay, last night
you and I were home

09:53.318 --> 09:55.318
watching<i> Dancing with the Stars</i>
all night.

09:55.411 --> 09:57.620
That's actually what I was
doing all last night.

09:57.672 --> 09:59.489
I thought Tom Bergeron
had a great show.

09:59.582 --> 10:01.007
One of his better nights.
The guy's a pro.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.416
It's Tyra Banks now.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.843
Brian, I can't do this with you.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.419
And what about you, Peter?

10:05.439 --> 10:07.755
I hear you haven't been
brushing your teeth.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.274
-Yes, I have.
-All of 'em?

10:09.501 --> 10:11.425
-Most of 'em.
-Careful there.

10:11.519 --> 10:14.187
The teeth are the doorway
to the body.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.765
Now, then, can I speak to your
dog who hates Christmas?

10:17.859 --> 10:20.176
Ho-ho-ho! Who have we got here?

10:20.195 --> 10:22.770
Can I interest anyone
in a candy cane?

10:22.864 --> 10:24.772
None for me, thanks.

10:24.866 --> 10:27.517
Ho-ho-okay, your loss.
After all,

10:27.535 --> 10:30.036
it is the world's most dangerous
candy. The more you eat it,

10:30.130 --> 10:32.188
the sharper it gets,
but it's worth stabbing

10:32.281 --> 10:34.707
your own mouth for a sweet
that tastes like toothpaste.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.209
I mean, Season's Greetings!

10:36.361 --> 10:38.378
Brian, where were you last night

10:38.530 --> 10:40.805
between 10:00 p.m. and midnight?

10:40.957 --> 10:42.974
Uh, let's see, uh,
food bank till 8:00.

10:43.126 --> 10:45.477
Uh,<i> Love Actually...</i>
(chuckles) again.

10:45.704 --> 10:48.313
And at no time did
I watch Tom Bergeron

10:48.464 --> 10:49.964
on<i> Dancing with the Stars</i>
because

10:49.983 --> 10:52.192
that would be impossible.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.302
Hmm, that's very helpful.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.656
Oh, good, 'cause I-I hope
more than anyone the culprit

10:57.883 --> 11:00.566
who took your nativity scene
is brought to justice.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.143
I'm mighty glad to hear that.

11:02.237 --> 11:04.404
Matter of fact, I was thinking
a hound like you'd

11:04.498 --> 11:07.666
be just the thing to help
sniff out some new clues.

11:07.817 --> 11:09.225
-What do you say?
-Uh, yeah.

11:09.318 --> 11:11.077
In-in fact,
you came to the right guy.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.229
I was briefly
McGruff's sidekick.

11:13.322 --> 11:14.506
<i> McGRUFF:</i>
<i> Ah, that's Jenny.</i>

11:14.733 --> 11:17.158
<i> -But that's not Jenny's dad.</i>
<i> -BRIAN: No, sir!</i>

11:17.177 --> 11:18.510
If she gets into that car,

11:18.661 --> 11:20.845
that may be the last time
you'll see Jenny.

11:21.072 --> 11:23.181
-Yep!
-I'm McGruff the Crime Dog.

11:23.332 --> 11:26.167
And I'm Sergeant Bark,
because I bark at crime.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.519
<i> McGRUFF:</i>
<i> See those kids?</i>

11:27.712 --> 11:28.912
<i> Every day in this country,</i>

11:29.005 --> 11:31.005
<i> 60 kids disappear.</i>

11:31.099 --> 11:33.191
-Hey, the bikes fell.
-Some run away.

11:33.342 --> 11:35.268
-You want me to get the bikes?
-But a lot are kidnapped
by strangers.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.344
-McGruff? McGruff?
-Or even by people they know.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.922
-Do you want me
to pick up the...?
-So write to McGruff.

11:39.015 --> 11:40.440
-Oh, you're-you're giving
the address.
-And teach your kids

11:40.592 --> 11:41.700
-to protect themselves.
-I'll get the bikes.

11:41.927 --> 11:42.608
-(grunting)
-Help, uh,

11:42.703 --> 11:43.776
<i> take a bite out of crime.</i>

11:43.945 --> 11:45.745
<i> BRIAN:</i>
<i>And don't forget to bark at it.</i>

11:53.455 --> 11:55.046
You know,
I've been thinking, Brian.

11:55.198 --> 11:57.048
Maybe the first thing
we ought to do is

11:57.200 --> 11:58.883
take an inventory
of what's missing.

11:59.035 --> 12:01.035
Could be there's
some clues in that.

12:01.129 --> 12:02.295
Yep, sure. Good thinking.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.447
Ah, you're a big Christmas guy.

12:04.466 --> 12:07.450
Remind me,
what's in a nativity scene?

12:07.452 --> 12:10.228
Nativity scene, sure. Uh, well,
you've got your drummer.

12:10.379 --> 12:13.639
Uh, probably a bassist, too.
Uh, Jesus, of course.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.234
Uh... Mr. Christ?

12:16.461 --> 12:19.053
I'm gonna say Santa,
then also the elves.

12:19.147 --> 12:21.555
Uh, the pig who makes friends
with a spider...

12:21.649 --> 12:23.316
writes, uh, nice things
in its web.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.485
S-S-S-Slater?

12:25.637 --> 12:27.245
Somebody-somebody named Slater?

12:27.396 --> 12:29.414
I think he's
from<i> Saved by the Bell.</i>

12:29.641 --> 12:30.990
Ah, I knew it sounded familiar,
but you know who

12:31.084 --> 12:32.250
we should really be looking at?

12:32.477 --> 12:34.902
People in town who don't
even celebrate Christmas.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.330
Like-like... Mort Goldman!

12:37.424 --> 12:38.906
Boo! Boo, Brian!

12:39.000 --> 12:41.301
They've suffered enough. Boo.

12:45.173 --> 12:47.248
"Dear Santa,
thank you in advance

12:47.267 --> 12:49.416
"for bringing me
a Happy Asking Panda.

12:49.511 --> 12:51.585

"and while I understand you

12:54.441 --> 12:56.516
"I just want to say

"It may not have seemed that
way, but we had agreed

12:58.928 --> 13:00.520
"ahead of time

13:00.614 --> 13:03.448
that would probably have seemed
confusing without that context."

Canceling Christmas?!

13:41.212 --> 13:42.487
Now we'll never know
what's behind

13:42.714 --> 13:45.139
the last box
on the M&M advent calendar!

13:45.158 --> 13:46.549
It's M&M'S, Peter.

13:46.568 --> 13:49.160
-They've all been M&M'S.
-You don't know that!

13:51.056 --> 13:52.497
You ate my whole family,

13:52.648 --> 13:54.648
you fat bastard.

13:54.742 --> 13:57.484
One. More. Day.

13:57.579 --> 13:59.320
(knocking)

13:59.414 --> 14:01.155
Joe? What are you doing here?

14:01.249 --> 14:03.399
Sorry, Peter, I'm on strict
orders from the mayor

14:03.418 --> 14:06.010
to confiscate
all the Christmas stuff in town.

14:06.162 --> 14:08.346
You heard him, Lois.
Hand over the Hallmark Channel.

14:08.573 --> 14:11.090
No Christmas means
no Happy Asking Panda.

14:11.242 --> 14:13.017
Stewie, I'm so sorry.

14:13.169 --> 14:15.669
But you got to understand
the position I'm in.

14:15.763 --> 14:17.730
(Stewie sobbing)

14:18.766 --> 14:20.191
I'll tell you this, Rupert.

14:20.418 --> 14:22.360
I shall not stand idly by
while our dog

14:22.587 --> 14:24.921
steals my dream
of a Happy Asking Panda.

14:25.014 --> 14:26.272
(inhales deeply)

14:27.275 --> 14:30.276
I may just have to send
a little text to our mayor.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.020
Yes, I did get a new phone case.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.039
It's Malibu Barbie
next to a palm tree.

14:35.191 --> 14:37.375
The man at the mall kiosk
said it was "girlish,"

14:37.602 --> 14:39.435
and I said, "Yeah?
Maybe I think she's hot."

14:39.528 --> 14:41.787
And he went, "Okay," and I went,
"What do you mean by 'Okay'?"

14:41.940 --> 14:43.456
And then he says,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14:43.608 --> 14:45.625
"I just came back from my wife's
oncologist appointment."

14:45.777 --> 14:47.218
And I said, "Oh, no.
What's wrong?" And he said,

14:47.445 --> 14:48.961
"Her melanoma's coming back."

14:49.055 --> 14:50.388
And I said, "I'm so sorry,
but they're making

14:50.615 --> 14:52.373
advancements in treatment
every single day."

14:52.392 --> 14:54.225
And he goes, "I know,
you're right, but still."

14:54.452 --> 14:55.968
And I said, "Just hang
in there," and he says,

14:56.062 --> 14:57.896
"Shoot me your digits,
our story does not

14:58.047 --> 15:00.398
end here," so we're going
out to dinner on Friday.

15:00.549 --> 15:02.734
I love this case.

15:05.797 --> 15:08.147
Sir, as you requested,
I've transcribed

15:08.241 --> 15:11.225
all your text messages
onto pieces of dried cowhide.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.302
These just came in.

15:13.396 --> 15:15.705
"Spirit Airlines parking lit."

15:17.492 --> 15:19.250
"Parking lit."

15:19.477 --> 15:22.236
"Parking lit. Asterisk, lot.

15:22.330 --> 15:25.298
L-O-L."

15:42.275 --> 15:44.667
Looks like we got our man.

15:44.686 --> 15:48.655
And still plenty of time
to pick up Aunt Betty.

15:50.525 --> 15:52.858
Oh, you really didn't have
to do this.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.744
We both know I did.

16:02.353 --> 16:05.112
Brian, is there anything
you want to say

16:05.131 --> 16:08.449
about the Baby Jesus-shaped dent
in the hood of your car?

16:08.543 --> 16:10.359
Oh, come on,
that doesn't prove anything!

16:10.453 --> 16:12.119
That could be any baby
I hit with my car!

16:12.138 --> 16:15.214
He was lying about Tom Bergeron
earlier. He had no idea.

16:15.366 --> 16:18.559
Why don't you open
the trunk for me?

16:19.628 --> 16:21.479
(laughing)

16:21.672 --> 16:23.982
No way! No way!

16:24.133 --> 16:25.799
You didn't even hide
the evidence?!

16:25.893 --> 16:28.486
Brian Griffin,
you're under arrest.

16:28.713 --> 16:31.214
(gasps) Just for destroying
public property

16:31.232 --> 16:32.490
and fleeing the scene
of the crime?!

16:32.641 --> 16:35.051
Why are we not leading
with drunk driving?

16:35.069 --> 16:37.553
I'm afraid I have
to take you to jail.

16:37.646 --> 16:39.313
Oh, no, not Brian!

16:39.332 --> 16:40.981
Do we get
the Hallmark Channel back?

16:41.001 --> 16:42.892
Jail?! Are you kidding me?!

16:42.985 --> 16:45.837
Wait a minute, you get three
square meals in jail, right?

16:46.064 --> 16:48.064
Well, I can't speak
for the shape,

16:48.157 --> 16:50.341
but the number sounds right.

16:53.238 --> 16:55.571
GUARD:
Griffin, visitor!

16:55.664 --> 16:57.073
(buzzer sounds)

16:57.166 --> 16:58.683
Hey, Brian,
sorry about the sling.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.000
I got shot by an M&M.

17:00.094 --> 17:01.853
Anyway, how's Christmas Eve
in jail?

17:02.080 --> 17:03.521
You know what, it's great.

17:03.672 --> 17:05.748
At least it keeps me away
from all the phony joy

17:05.767 --> 17:07.250
and crass commercialism.

17:07.268 --> 17:08.842
Well, it's good
to see you haven't lost

17:08.862 --> 17:10.253
your lack of spirit.

17:10.271 --> 17:12.255
Well, it certainly is
great seeing you, Brian.

17:12.273 --> 17:13.756
-(text whooshes)
-(phone chimes)

17:13.775 --> 17:15.533
Hey, guys, unfortunately

17:15.760 --> 17:17.201
visiting hours end at...

17:17.428 --> 17:18.611
10:14.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.871
Aw! Aw!

17:20.098 --> 17:22.582
It's like we just got here, aw!

17:28.381 --> 17:30.214
(yawns)

17:30.441 --> 17:33.276
Ah, best night's sleep
in a long time.

17:33.294 --> 17:35.869
I should spend Christmas
in jail every year.

17:35.963 --> 17:38.056
(children clamoring outside)

17:41.544 --> 17:44.878
(scoffs) Stupid families having
stupid fun times together.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.623
Reminding themselves
their families are...

17:47.758 --> 17:49.692
filled with love.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.991
Huh, looks like Stewie got
that toy he wanted.

18:02.898 --> 18:04.974
(sighs)
A kid and his bear.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.293
What's more innocent than that?

18:10.906 --> 18:12.906
Aw, they got tennis balls
and junk?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.176
(Chris panting)

18:17.746 --> 18:19.822
I don't even like stupid

18:19.915 --> 18:22.058

19:16.564 --> 19:19.306
to prop up a faltering economy,
but it's also about family

19:19.400 --> 19:22.551
and togetherness
and the Hallmark Channel,

19:22.570 --> 19:24.236
which I admit
I watch all the time!

19:24.330 --> 19:26.389
Oh, my God, I love Christmas!

19:26.407 --> 19:29.167
(sobbing)

19:30.728 --> 19:32.077
<i> NARRATOR:</i>
<i> And what happened then?</i>

19:32.230 --> 19:33.729
<i> Well, in prison they say,</i>

19:33.748 --> 19:38.325
<i> Brian's anus grew</i>
<i> three sizes that day.</i>

19:38.344 --> 19:40.845
Brian... you are free to go.

19:40.996 --> 19:43.406
What? What do you mean?

19:43.499 --> 19:45.349
I just wanted you to learn
that while you thought

19:45.501 --> 19:49.020
it was everyone else who'd lost
the true meaning of Christmas,

19:49.171 --> 19:52.273
it was actually you all along.

19:54.752 --> 19:57.344
So why don't you head
outside to your family?

19:57.363 --> 19:58.587
I will.

19:58.681 --> 20:01.532
But first there's something
I've got to do.

20:03.428 --> 20:04.518
Ah?

20:04.537 --> 20:07.038
It's like you killed Him
all over again.

20:14.196 --> 20:16.272
Oh, Brian,
it's good to have you back.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.049
It wasn't Christmas without you.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.717
I'm happy to be back.

20:19.944 --> 20:21.719
And I'm happy
to have my tennis ball.

20:21.946 --> 20:23.462
(growls)

20:23.614 --> 20:25.948
Meg? Lois?
You got any more passwords?

20:25.967 --> 20:28.467
The panda loves 'em.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.728
(blipping)

20:42.967 --> 20:44.575
The Griffin assets, sir.

20:44.802 --> 20:47.578
At last. $17?

20:47.730 --> 20:49.747
The bear cost $23 to make.

20:49.898 --> 20:51.582
Oh, no.

20:55.663 --> 20:58.330
<i> PETER: Can't rob America</i>
<i> if America's broke!</i>

20:58.424 --> 21:00.591
<i> Merry Christmas, everyone!</i>
