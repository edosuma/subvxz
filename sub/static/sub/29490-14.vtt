WEBVTT

00:16.233 --> 00:17.756
Shit.

00:25.503 --> 00:28.289
Well,as I live and breathe.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.944
I figured
you'd be Gabey,

00:31.988 --> 00:36.688
coming downto give me my last rites.

00:36.732 --> 00:37.689
You want forgiveness?

00:39.213 --> 00:40.953
I done what I done.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.347
I ain't getting on my kneesabout it.

00:43.391 --> 00:46.046
So what do you want?

00:46.089 --> 00:47.830
A T-bone, beer,

00:47.873 --> 00:51.138
maybe a scoop
of rocky road.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.749
Matters to you
what I want?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.751
What if
you didn't have to die?

01:04.412 --> 01:06.153
Didn't know
you had a say

01:06.196 --> 01:08.807
on the kangaroo councildeciding my fate.

01:08.851 --> 01:10.809
I'm not here
for the council.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.029
I'm getting that.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.162
What I don't get
is coming down here

01:15.205 --> 01:18.165
and dealing with me
when, seems to me,

01:18.208 --> 01:20.602
you oughta be lining upthe ol' Skin Queen

01:20.645 --> 01:21.951
in your crosshairs.

01:24.214 --> 01:26.825
What do you think
this is?

01:28.349 --> 01:29.828
Damn.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.787
The stones on you...

01:31.830 --> 01:33.267
So you in or out?

01:33.310 --> 01:36.618
Word has it you area certified bad-ass.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.794
But you missed
your shot.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.405
What happens
if I muff it, too?

01:41.449 --> 01:45.148
Could make things a helluva lotworse for every man,

01:45.192 --> 01:47.846
woman, and child
behind these walls.

01:47.890 --> 01:51.589
And despitewhat people may think of me,

01:51.633 --> 01:54.984
I am absolutely
not down with that.

01:57.465 --> 02:00.642
I need this done.

02:00.685 --> 02:04.472
And that'll help every man,
woman, and child here.

02:06.038 --> 02:08.040
And what do
I get out of it?

02:08.084 --> 02:09.390
You've been eating

02:09.433 --> 02:11.870
whatever shit
we throw your way,

02:11.914 --> 02:14.830
hoping that one day,
they'll all forget.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.962
But they won't.

02:18.486 --> 02:22.446
Not unless you do something
to make them forget.

02:24.492 --> 02:28.060
So you bring me
Alpha's head,

02:28.104 --> 02:31.586
and that's what the people
will remember you for.

02:31.629 --> 02:34.763
I'll make sure
of it.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.467
I have your word?

02:43.511 --> 02:46.035
If you do it fast.

02:55.305 --> 02:58.178
Negan: Is this
what you wanted?

03:07.056 --> 03:08.275
All right.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.233
What do you,
uh...

03:10.277 --> 03:13.105
what do you say
we get movin'?

03:15.151 --> 03:16.848
Alexandria.
Our deal.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.155
Let's start
spreading the news.

03:21.331 --> 03:24.073
What took you
so damn long?

03:24.116 --> 03:26.293
What took me
so long?

03:26.336 --> 03:28.338
Doing your dirty work?

03:28.382 --> 03:30.688
I don't know.

03:30.732 --> 03:31.950
I guessI wanted to get out of there

03:31.994 --> 03:33.430
with my head
still attached.

03:33.474 --> 03:34.910
Shit like that
takes time.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.564
I told you
to do it fast.

03:36.607 --> 03:37.956
It's done.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.132
All right?
I held up my end.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.526
Now I am asking you
to hold up yours.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.224
Just walk me
through those gates

03:44.267 --> 03:47.531
so I can open up a new chapterin the Book of Negan.

03:49.098 --> 03:52.449
I'm not going back.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.277
Not yet.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.758
I go back there
without you,

03:56.801 --> 03:58.542
there is a noose
around my neck

03:58.586 --> 04:00.283
the secondI step foot in there.

04:00.327 --> 04:03.678
Then wait.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.941
Wait?

04:05.984 --> 04:09.988
How long
are we talking about?

04:10.032 --> 04:11.599
You're free now,
Negan.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.557
Do whatever the hellyou want.

04:13.601 --> 04:16.299
Wait, don't wait,
it's up to you.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.780
I need to be alone.

04:18.823 --> 04:21.739
Shit like that
takes time.

05:16.881 --> 05:19.275
Jerry:
The kids are good.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.929
All of 'em.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.757
We got lucky.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.890
Yeah,
I'll take it.

05:25.934 --> 05:29.111
That doesn't absolve me
from failing.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.243
Take it easy
on yourself, Boss.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.247
These days, the mistakes
seem to stick harder

05:35.291 --> 05:36.466
than the triumphs.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.384
Hey.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.517
Hi.

05:49.261 --> 05:52.656
Oh.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.136
Oh, no.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.659
Careful.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.008
Hey.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.445
You're alive.

05:58.488 --> 06:01.361
Where --
H-How did you...?

06:01.404 --> 06:04.102
I'm so sorry, Magna.I...

06:04.146 --> 06:05.843
Did you need anything?

06:05.887 --> 06:07.192
Did you --
No, no, no.

06:07.236 --> 06:09.630
I-I'm okay.
I'm okay.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.550
Oof.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.641
How're you feeling?

06:20.684 --> 06:22.425
Great.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.735
I can bring you
to see Alex.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.780
When we find Alex.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.129
Mnh-mnh.

06:31.173 --> 06:32.914
Someone else
can do that.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.394
You gotta go.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.267
Dammit, Eugene.

06:39.311 --> 06:42.053
Tell them already.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.239
Okay.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.288
Excuse me.
Uh...

07:00.811 --> 07:03.379
Uh, excuse me.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.815
Uh...

07:06.382 --> 07:09.167
Can I have your kind attention,
please?

07:09.211 --> 07:12.040
Um...

07:13.998 --> 07:18.568
I have some things I -- I need
to 'fess and request.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.962
Um...

07:21.005 --> 07:23.530
I've been
in radio communicado

07:23.573 --> 07:25.575
with someone
outside our orbit.

07:25.619 --> 07:26.968
A new person.

07:27.011 --> 07:29.797
And we set up a time
to meet.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.189
Yumiko: What?

07:31.233 --> 07:32.539
Who is it?

07:32.582 --> 07:34.062
Her name
is Stephanie and --

07:34.105 --> 07:35.716
Wait.Is this another community?

07:35.759 --> 07:37.152
Jerry:
Where is it? What --

07:37.195 --> 07:38.806
What'd you tell her
about us?

07:38.849 --> 07:40.198
And now
you're going to meet her.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.722
She could be another spyjust like Dante.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.639
Uh...

07:45.682 --> 07:48.772
Eugene, how long have you been
keeping this from us?

07:48.816 --> 07:51.253
I have some of
the same questions.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.997
But if Eugene's instincts
are that this...

07:56.040 --> 07:57.520
Stephanie...

07:57.564 --> 08:00.567
may be a new ally,

08:00.610 --> 08:04.353
then let's hear him out
before we jump to conclusions.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.880
We're all on
the same side here.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.406
Now, some of you
are well aware

08:14.450 --> 08:18.236
that I relocated
to Hilltop, uh,

08:18.280 --> 08:21.544
in pursuit of
a metaphorical fresh start.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.243
Uh...

08:25.287 --> 08:27.245
I struggled for awhile.

08:27.289 --> 08:30.553
I buried myself in work
and community duties, and...

08:30.597 --> 08:33.600
and that work manifested
a voice from the void.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.602
And...

08:35.645 --> 08:38.213
she became a friend.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.607
Some of you might claim
that I'm foolish

08:40.650 --> 08:45.481
to believe in future friends
and new alliances, but...

08:45.525 --> 08:48.484
after everything
we just lost,

08:48.528 --> 08:51.269
I'm willing
to be the fool.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.358
I simply askthat you spare me your derision,

08:53.402 --> 08:55.404
as a hopeful expectation
of new, good people

08:55.447 --> 08:56.710
is wholly worth
the risk.

09:16.904 --> 09:20.864
You can take
my horse.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.300
For what?

09:22.344 --> 09:25.477
You should
go with them.

09:25.521 --> 09:28.350
You never wanted
to be cooped up.

09:28.393 --> 09:31.658
You could get back out
on the road,

09:31.701 --> 09:34.878
have an adventure.

09:34.922 --> 09:39.317
Look forward,
not back.

09:39.361 --> 09:42.103
I like it here.

09:44.148 --> 09:47.674
I think some routinecould be good for me.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.458
Yeah?

09:52.156 --> 09:54.028
Okay.

09:54.071 --> 09:56.900
But someone elseshould have the adventure.

09:56.944 --> 09:59.511
Meet the new people.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.694
It's okay, Miko.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.612
It'd be leaving
at the worst time. I...

10:15.571 --> 10:18.356
There's nothing
for you to fix.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.190
Go.

10:53.435 --> 10:56.046
Hey, buddy.

10:57.613 --> 11:00.181
Hey, play with your sister,okay?

11:05.795 --> 11:08.580
Jerry.

11:10.626 --> 11:13.063
You're really going?

11:14.630 --> 11:15.979
Yeah.

11:16.023 --> 11:18.678
I don't think
that's a good idea.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.723
Because I'm sick?

11:24.640 --> 11:27.208
Because I'm gonna
miss you.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.908
But can't stop a manwilling to be foolish, right?

11:33.475 --> 11:37.000
Or a fool willing to believe
in future friends.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.699
Is that all it is?

11:39.742 --> 11:42.614
It's enough for now.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.228
The Kingdom needs you.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.839
Make sure
our legacy lives on.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.452
You got it, Bo--

11:56.063 --> 11:57.717
Ezekiel.

12:21.436 --> 12:24.265
She was with Negan.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.789
Did he...

12:29.096 --> 12:30.662
You...

12:30.706 --> 12:32.708
You are
the Alpha now.

12:36.668 --> 12:40.063
What did you say?

12:40.107 --> 12:41.499
I...

12:41.543 --> 12:44.546
She can hear you.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.508
Take off your mask.

13:03.739 --> 13:06.307
Can you hear her?

13:14.141 --> 13:16.099
Are you listening?

13:16.143 --> 13:18.885
Yeah.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.888
What is she saying
to you?

13:21.931 --> 13:25.239
I don't know.
I --

13:25.282 --> 13:27.415
Move closer.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.330
I-I don't know...

13:29.373 --> 13:31.593
Shh.
Just listen.

13:33.638 --> 13:36.337
What is she saying
to you?

13:36.380 --> 13:37.860
Aah!

13:40.689 --> 13:44.562
Shh.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.871
Just listen.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.354
I-I-I can hear!

13:53.397 --> 13:55.530
I can hear!

14:32.001 --> 14:34.612
Hey, kiddo.
Sorry ab--

14:34.656 --> 14:35.918
Shit.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.573
God!

14:38.616 --> 14:39.879
Where's Alpha?!

14:39.922 --> 14:42.403
Look,whatever Lydia told you --

14:42.446 --> 14:43.752
Where is she?!

14:43.795 --> 14:46.059
She is dead.
She is dead.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.321
I killed her.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.583
You liar.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.324
I am not lying.

14:50.367 --> 14:51.629
I have somethin'
in my pocket.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.631
It's not a weapon.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.417
I am slowly
gonna reach for it.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.337
Her mask
ain't her head.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.861
Oh, I know.I am getting to that.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.603
Well, then,
get to it.

15:08.646 --> 15:11.127
The whole reason I threw inwith them...

15:11.171 --> 15:13.651
was so I couldget close enough to Alpha

15:13.695 --> 15:15.131
to slit her throat.

15:15.175 --> 15:18.221
Now, you talk about"silencing the Whisperers."

15:18.265 --> 15:21.442
I silenced the Alpha.

15:21.485 --> 15:24.010
Why the hell else
you think

15:24.053 --> 15:26.360
that your girlfriendlet me outta that cell?

15:32.714 --> 15:35.325
Woman: Carol.

15:40.287 --> 15:43.855
Caaarol...

15:55.911 --> 15:58.566
Woman: Carol.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.924
I'm always watching.

18:59.050 --> 19:02.053
You are lost.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.622
So was your boy.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.494
You sent him away.

19:09.104 --> 19:12.194
And he never
came back.

19:12.238 --> 19:16.546
He died out here,
alone and afraid.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.722
Just like Sophia.

19:25.903 --> 19:27.253
No taking this head.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.646
Unless you take
your own.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.696
I respect
what you did.

19:35.739 --> 19:38.699
It was Negan
drew the blade,

19:38.742 --> 19:42.268
but it was you
who ended me.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.139
Like a true alpha.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.446
Stop it.

19:46.489 --> 19:47.708
Oh, I see.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.275
You regret it.

19:49.318 --> 19:50.711
No.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.843
You feel guilt.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.585
People were hurt
in the name of vengeance.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.457
And now
you can't go back.

19:57.500 --> 20:01.025
They won't accept
what you've done.

20:01.069 --> 20:05.116
Maybe they will
if you say you're sorry.

20:06.988 --> 20:09.120
"I'm sorry
you're mad at me.

20:09.164 --> 20:12.211
P-Please don't be
mad at me.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.951
I'm sorry!"

20:13.995 --> 20:17.477
Being out
on your own --

20:17.520 --> 20:20.523
you've tried it before.

20:20.567 --> 20:24.135
They always
pull you back.

20:24.179 --> 20:28.096
Always wanting more.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.663
Love.

20:29.706 --> 20:32.231
Motherhood.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.971
Death.

20:34.015 --> 20:37.236
But they don't knowwhat you truly want.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.977
Admit it.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.850
What do you want?

20:42.893 --> 20:46.157
What do you want?

20:46.201 --> 20:48.986
Say it.

20:49.030 --> 20:51.989
Say it.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.731
Say it.

21:10.965 --> 21:13.010
I want to be alone.

21:13.054 --> 21:15.143
Yeah.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.798
That's not it.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.631
Do you think
they'll have candy?

21:26.763 --> 21:29.853
The new community,
I mean.

21:29.897 --> 21:32.813
What on earth
made you think of that?

21:32.856 --> 21:34.641
I was remembering
my mother,

21:34.684 --> 21:37.121
who grew upnear train tracks like this.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.123
My mother was a pistol,
as they say,

21:39.167 --> 21:41.865
so I was trying to remembersomething kind about her,

21:41.909 --> 21:44.041
and I settled onthese chocolate bunnies

21:44.085 --> 21:47.044
she used to buy
at Easter time.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.612
I was macking on them,and they were delicious,

21:49.656 --> 21:53.616
though eating the headsdid upset me as a child, and...

21:53.660 --> 21:56.358
still, I came toassociate them with...

21:56.402 --> 21:58.055
family.

21:58.099 --> 22:00.188
Eugene, please tell me
we aren't really on a journey

22:00.231 --> 22:01.407
to find
chocolate bunnies.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.365
Well,
of course not.

22:03.409 --> 22:07.413
We're on a journey forthe future hope of mankind.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.763
But candy
would be nice.

22:10.807 --> 22:12.679
Ezekiel,
are you okay?

22:12.722 --> 22:15.334
Or shall I delve intomy arsenal of impressions?

22:16.378 --> 22:17.727
I'm sorry, Eugene.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.425
I'm not the best audience
at the moment.

22:26.910 --> 22:29.130
Whoa.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.266
Whisperers?

22:35.310 --> 22:37.878
Not their
modus operandi.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.749
So we're not alone,

22:39.793 --> 22:42.448
but we don't know
who would do this.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.928
Worth taking a few moments
to investigate?

22:44.972 --> 22:46.582
In case
this is a warning.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.469
Whoa.

23:42.203 --> 23:45.902
Yumiko:
All clear!

23:45.946 --> 23:47.730
Ezekiel?

23:47.774 --> 23:49.950
I'm coming!

23:49.993 --> 23:52.866
All clear here.

23:52.909 --> 23:55.956
Negan: This whole"follow the leader" routine,

23:55.999 --> 23:59.438
it's kinda déjà vu
for me.

23:59.481 --> 24:03.137
It's the same wayit went down with Alpha.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.182
You know,
I get it.

24:05.226 --> 24:07.054
All right,
you're pissed

24:07.097 --> 24:09.970
your gal pal didn'tlet you in on the plan.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.493
Nobody asked you.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.582
Look,
I'm pissed, too.

24:13.626 --> 24:17.543
Lone wolves, they're notthinking about the pack.

24:17.586 --> 24:20.371
Maybe I'm pissed
'cause of Hilltop.

24:20.415 --> 24:23.070
Whole bunch of children
almost died 'cause of you.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.990
Keep walking.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.811

take the river out?

25:43.716 --> 25:45.413
Ed was right
about you.

25:45.456 --> 25:48.068
You're just
a brainless clam.

25:50.853 --> 25:53.595
There was no peace
on the ocean.

25:53.639 --> 25:56.076
You were thinking
about me.

Wondering where I went.

26:52.828 --> 26:55.526
We're talking about
Lydia here.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.920
Why would I stash her
out in banjo country

26:57.964 --> 26:59.705
unless the whole point
was to keep her safe?

26:59.748 --> 27:01.620
Unless the whole
freakin' point

27:01.663 --> 27:04.666
was just to use her as bait
so I could get Alpha alone?

27:04.710 --> 27:06.799
You sure took your sweet-asstime, though, didn't you?

27:06.842 --> 27:09.715
What is with you guys thinking
I didn't do it fast enough?

27:09.758 --> 27:12.021
You didn't kill her.
I did.

27:12.065 --> 27:14.850
It took a minute.
I had to get her to trust me.

27:14.894 --> 27:17.810
Because I wasn't on some
half-cocked suicide mission.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.681
No, it's because
you liked it.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.437
Alpha's dead.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.221

Oh.

29:06.875 --> 29:10.052
Taking my sweet-ass time.

29:11.880 --> 29:17.277
All right, fellas,first order of business.

29:19.105 --> 29:20.671
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.282
One damn minute.

29:22.325 --> 29:23.849
I'm supposed to be
the Alpha, right?

29:23.892 --> 29:25.546
I mean,the only reason I'm asking

29:25.589 --> 29:27.156
is I'ma little bit confused.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.679
If I'm the Alpha,

29:28.723 --> 29:32.814
why is someone who ismost definitely not the Alpha

29:32.858 --> 29:35.295
holding
the badass shotgun?

29:41.431 --> 29:45.871
See, that iswhat I'm talkin' about.

29:45.914 --> 29:48.003
That feels good.

29:48.047 --> 29:49.265
Right?

29:49.309 --> 29:51.224
I mean,I never had a kid of my own,

29:51.267 --> 29:53.879
but if I did,
I would imagine

29:53.922 --> 29:55.881
this is what it's likeholding your baby

29:55.924 --> 29:58.318
for the very first time,except for it turns out,

29:58.361 --> 30:02.104
my baby can kill peopleby spitting bullets at 'em.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.415
Daryl,
kneel to the Alpha.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.863
Damn.

30:21.907 --> 30:27.738
It is starting to get real now,ain't it?

30:27.782 --> 30:29.349
Daryl,
you were right

30:29.392 --> 30:32.047
when you said
that I liked it.

30:33.788 --> 30:35.921
The fact is...

30:35.964 --> 30:39.446
I like it a lot.

30:39.489 --> 30:42.579
You should probably
shoot me.

30:42.623 --> 30:45.191
Don't threaten me
with a good time.

30:47.062 --> 30:48.324
Shit.

31:00.597 --> 31:02.686
Untie me, asshole.

31:19.355 --> 31:22.489
What's wrong?
What's going on? Hey.

31:22.532 --> 31:25.361
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa.

31:25.405 --> 31:27.450
Lookit, hey, hey.
It's all right.

31:27.494 --> 31:28.799
It's okay.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.932
It's okay.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.717
Hey, hey.
What's going on?

31:37.983 --> 31:42.422
Oh, no, no, no.

31:42.465 --> 31:44.772
Shh.

31:44.815 --> 31:47.209
It's okay.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.908
It's okay.

31:51.953 --> 31:55.130
Nothing's got to hurt anymore.

32:03.530 --> 32:07.577
It's okay.

32:07.621 --> 32:10.015
Shh.

32:12.887 --> 32:15.324
You're all right.

32:15.368 --> 32:19.111
You're all right.

32:29.730 --> 32:32.994
I'm sorry.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.475
Ezekiel.

32:39.305 --> 32:41.829
I'm so sorry.

32:41.872 --> 32:45.224
I shouldn't have come.Why?

32:45.267 --> 32:48.140
This was just
an accident.

32:51.099 --> 32:55.712
If I fall in there...

32:55.756 --> 32:59.020
promise meyou'll leave me behind.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.327
No.

33:01.370 --> 33:05.374
He wasn't strong enoughto make the journey.

33:06.462 --> 33:07.724
Maybe I'm not,
either.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.640
I'm okay with that.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.469
But I'm not okaywith putting you at risk.

33:13.513 --> 33:15.471
So you want
to turn back?

33:15.515 --> 33:18.822
Because of
what might happen?

33:21.129 --> 33:23.653
It's for the best.Hey.

33:23.697 --> 33:26.961
You don't know
what lies ahead for us.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.746
No one does.

33:29.790 --> 33:32.314
I had all these plans
for my life,

33:32.358 --> 33:34.534
and I clung to them
so hard.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.579
And f-f-for what?

33:36.623 --> 33:40.975
No one cares what I have in mindfor the future.

33:41.019 --> 33:45.632
I'm here to find out
what's possible --

33:45.675 --> 33:49.331
what none of us
could predict

33:49.375 --> 33:51.464
or imagine.

33:53.901 --> 33:57.122
And you know
who we need with us?

33:57.165 --> 34:00.168
That man that built a Kingdom
in the apocalypse.

34:31.852 --> 34:34.333
Alpha:
My mom used to say,

34:34.376 --> 34:38.337
everything works outthe way it's supposed to.

34:38.380 --> 34:42.428
Oh,
just shut up already.

34:47.172 --> 34:50.392
It's finally time.

34:54.048 --> 34:55.615
This way, friend!

34:55.658 --> 34:59.009
We're ready for ya.

34:59.053 --> 35:02.839
You always knew
how this would end.

35:02.883 --> 35:05.538
No one's coming
to save you.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.192
Not Ezekiel.

35:07.235 --> 35:10.412
And certainly
not Daryl.

35:10.456 --> 35:12.806
Not after what you didto Connie.

35:17.419 --> 35:19.769
Stop fighting.

35:22.468 --> 35:26.385
No matter what you do,you lose people.

35:26.428 --> 35:31.216
Sophia, Lizzie, Mika,

35:31.259 --> 35:36.351
Henry, Ezekiel...

35:36.395 --> 35:39.224
And if you go back,

35:39.267 --> 35:41.791
Daryl could be next.

35:41.835 --> 35:45.230
I could never
let that happen.

35:45.273 --> 35:49.103
Your track recorddoes not inspire confidence.

35:51.323 --> 35:53.499
You know
what you gotta do.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.936
I could've been anyone,

35:55.979 --> 36:00.462
but you chose mebecause I get the job done.

36:00.506 --> 36:03.073
I don't want this.

36:13.083 --> 36:17.566
Just look at the flowerslike you're supposed to.

36:17.610 --> 36:21.309
One...

36:21.353 --> 36:24.269
two...

36:24.312 --> 36:26.923
three.

37:02.176 --> 37:04.744
It's never too late.

37:17.365 --> 37:20.150
Whoa.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.795
Not to spin
a broken record,

37:55.838 --> 37:59.451
but I don't think
she's comin' back.

38:06.066 --> 38:09.287
You know, I'm --I'm not bullshitting you.

38:10.636 --> 38:13.291
I know.

38:15.641 --> 38:20.036
When I said
that I liked it...

38:20.080 --> 38:22.822
that wasn't
part of the act.

38:22.865 --> 38:25.303
Yeah.
I know.

38:29.263 --> 38:33.223
You know,
when your people locked me up,

38:33.267 --> 38:35.574
I lost everything.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.228
You know,
seven years spent

38:38.272 --> 38:42.494
staring outthat little window...

38:42.537 --> 38:44.452
man,
it sucked.

38:44.496 --> 38:45.714
It got so bad

38:45.758 --> 38:49.327
that even my memorieshad bars painted on 'em.

38:50.458 --> 38:53.940
So when Alpha
took me in...

38:53.983 --> 38:56.856
I admit it,
I -- I liked it.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.553
It was...

39:00.120 --> 39:02.644
It was nice
feeling like I mattered again,

39:02.688 --> 39:06.126
like I was respected.

39:06.169 --> 39:08.737
But she took it
too far.

39:10.130 --> 39:14.613
You don't kill peoplethat don't deserve it.

39:14.656 --> 39:17.442
And you never
kill kids.

39:17.485 --> 39:20.532
Is that supposed to
make me like you?

39:22.316 --> 39:23.491
No.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.885
Good.

39:25.928 --> 39:29.541
But what aboutmy winning personality?

39:40.769 --> 39:43.293
What about Carol?

40:17.327 --> 40:20.113
Yumiko: What are the chancesof a city like this being empty?

40:20.156 --> 40:24.596
More improbable than a baby bornwith a full set of teeth.

40:27.555 --> 40:30.428
Hellllooo?

42:23.192 --> 42:26.065
