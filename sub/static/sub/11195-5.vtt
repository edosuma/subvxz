00:14.556 --> 00:17.434
Tuesday doesn't work for the president.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.229
The High Councillor of the Tok'ra
is coming to Earth...

00:20.312 --> 00:24.149
..to sign a treaty that outlines
our new alliance against the Goa'uld.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.443
What could be more important than that?

00:26.568 --> 00:31.532
Keeping that treaty a secret from
the general population of our planet.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.493
It's a tricky proposition where we're from.

00:34.576 --> 00:38.497
The president means no disrespect,
but he has to appear before Congress...

00:38.580 --> 00:42.668
..and there's no way to make up
an excuse to get out of that.

00:42.751 --> 00:47.464
- Wednesday. How's Wednesday?
- (newcomer) Wednesday will be fine.

00:57.474 --> 01:01.061
Colonel O'Neill, Dr Jackson,
Major Graham, Captain Blasdale,...

01:01.186 --> 01:04.063
..may I present
Supreme High Councillor Per'sus.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.525
Please, forgive me for being late.

01:09.945 --> 01:12.239
It's an honour to meet you.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.033
Look out!

01:34.720 --> 01:36.763
Graham!

01:38.891 --> 01:42.227
St... Stop... Stop me.

03:19.867 --> 03:23.704
Fortunately, High Councillor Per'sus
is going to recover.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.376
What happened?

03:29.501 --> 03:32.462
- I'd like to know that.
- The high councillor came in,...

03:32.546 --> 03:34.840
..Martouf introduced us
and Graham went nuts.

03:34.965 --> 03:38.719
- And he pulled a weapon?
- It seemed to be of Goa'uld origin.

03:38.802 --> 03:39.803
Look, Martouf...

03:39.928 --> 03:43.599
I do not believe you were complicit
with Major Graham's actions.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.685
We weren't, but how can you
be sure we weren't?

03:48.395 --> 03:49.479
I cannot.

03:51.190 --> 03:54.026
I can. Major Graham was a Zatarc.

03:55.110 --> 03:59.323
- A what?
- The victim of Goa'uld mind control.

03:59.781 --> 04:00.782
A what?

04:00.908 --> 04:03.994
A mission is programmed into
the victim's subconscious,...

04:04.077 --> 04:06.705
..then covered with a false memory.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.875
- You knew this threat was out there?
- Freya gave her theory...

04:10.000 --> 04:12.836
..to the High Council,
but it is only conjecture.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.297
The technology's existence
is unconfirmed.

04:15.422 --> 04:19.009
See, this is just the kind of
irresponsible, uncooperative bull...

04:19.134 --> 04:22.471
I agree, Colonel. Unfortunately
the High Council did not,...

04:22.596 --> 04:26.642
..despite the fact that I documented
three incidents in the last two months.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.102
Otherwise healthy Tok'ra operatives...

04:29.186 --> 04:32.773
..suffered extreme behavioural episodes,
each ending in suicide.

04:32.898 --> 04:36.652
- No red flags went up for anyone?
- This weapon has not been used before.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.862
So the person doesn't know
what happens?

04:38.987 --> 04:42.324
No, they're unaware their minds
have been tampered with.

04:42.407 --> 04:46.620
The instructions seem to be triggered
by a visual or auditory signal.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.164
Obviously the high councillor
was the target.

04:49.248 --> 04:53.544
When Major Graham was introduced
to Per'sus, the programming took over.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.421
He would have been
unable to control his actions.

04:56.505 --> 05:00.717
- But this is theoretical?
- It is difficult to prove without evidence.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.262
The violent, self-destructive behaviour...

05:03.387 --> 05:07.474
..is an integral part of the programming,
meant to ensure that result.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.935
How does one get turned into a Zatarc?

05:10.060 --> 05:14.356
The programming only seems to require
moments of access with the victim.

05:14.439 --> 05:19.069
Had we known any of this, we might have
been able to take a few more precautions.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.363
We could not have taken
any more than we did.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.825
We could have more of these
time bombs waiting to go off.

05:24.908 --> 05:28.829
If the Goa'uld knew Major Graham would
be here to meet the high councillor...

05:28.912 --> 05:30.497
They know about the summit.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.834
Their goal was undoubtedly
to sabotage our alliance.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.295
And the president could also be a target.

05:36.378 --> 05:39.715
The high councillor wishes to
continue with the treaty summit.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.092
- Oh, I don't think so.
- In 2,000 years,...

05:42.217 --> 05:44.887
..the Tok'ra have never
bowed to Goa'uld terrorism.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.930
- We will not start now.
- Either way,...

05:47.055 --> 05:51.768
..anyone encountering the Goa'uld in the
last two months may have fallen victim.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.355
The problem is, Zatarc programming
is almost impossible to detect.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.357
- Not true.
- Your method is unproven.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.152
- It worked once before.
- Even that is in question.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.362
- It is all we have right now.
- Excuse me!

06:05.407 --> 06:08.118
Do we or do we not
have a Xanax detector?

06:14.666 --> 06:16.710
Colonel.

06:18.170 --> 06:22.966
Martouf, Anise, on behalf of the SGC,
I want to offer my sincerest apologies...

06:23.091 --> 06:26.094
..and condolences for
the lives of the lost Tok'ra.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.642
High Councillor Per'sus also sends
regrets for the men of the SGC.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.894
We consider Major Graham also a victim.

06:34.019 --> 06:39.066
All SG teams are being recalled for
screening and placed on a 24-hour watch.

06:39.191 --> 06:42.444
I'll begin with the remaining
members of Major Graham's team.

06:42.528 --> 06:46.615
There was obviously opportunity to
program him on a recent mission.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.742
This way. Major Carter?

06:57.751 --> 06:59.795
They're at it again.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.426
I completed my autopsy
on Major Graham.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.846
There was an unidentifiable residue,...

07:08.971 --> 07:12.558
..but no indication he was under
any kind of chemical influence.

07:12.641 --> 07:15.561
If they tried to cover up their work,
they did a good job.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.647
What about the information
provided by the Tok'ra?

07:18.730 --> 07:20.524
Pretty limited to speculation.

07:20.607 --> 07:25.070
I examined Graham before he went to
Vorash and he seemed in perfect health.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.115
His blood work was clean,
last psych evaluation normal.

07:28.198 --> 07:32.452
If his brain was altered, the technology
is far beyond my understanding.

07:32.536 --> 07:36.665
- Will this Zatarc detector work?
- It's alien technology. I don't know.

07:36.748 --> 07:40.502
- Then we're in the hands of the Tok'ra.
- The colonel must be happy(!)

07:40.586 --> 07:43.672
I'm not thrilled about it myself, Doctor.

07:56.852 --> 08:00.689
Hello, Lieutenant... Astor.
Please have a seat.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.640
Try to stay calm. Direct your vision here.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.230
I will ask you some questions.

08:41.313 --> 08:45.609
Please answer as completely
and truthfully as possible.

08:50.489 --> 08:54.409
Describe for me
your recent mission to P6Y-325.

08:55.244 --> 08:57.371
Well, it...

08:57.496 --> 09:00.415
It seemed to be a routine meet and greet.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.418
At least, at first.

09:03.502 --> 09:06.672
The Lasarians were
a fairly primitive people.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.049
So it's a lie detector?

09:09.132 --> 09:12.135
It's more. It detects
if a person is being truthful,...

09:12.261 --> 09:14.805
..even if they are not aware they are lying.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.475
- It reads the subconscious?
- Comparing it to the conscious memory.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.769
It was created to verify information...

09:20.853 --> 09:24.439
..retrieved from the torture
of captured Goa'uld.

09:24.523 --> 09:28.026
The thing on her forehead looks
like a Tok'ra memory-recall device.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.778
Yes, a modified version.

09:29.903 --> 09:34.449
It is able to decipher whether
a memory being recalled is true or false.

09:34.533 --> 09:39.079
It finds a Zatarc because the Goa'uld use
false memories to hide the programming?

09:39.204 --> 09:42.875
- That is Anise's theory, yes.
- Can you identify the Zatarc's mission?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.587
Unfortunately, no.
It will only tell us if a person is a Zatarc,...

09:46.712 --> 09:48.922
- ..not what he's programmed to do.
- Hello.

09:49.047 --> 09:53.760
(Astor) Major Graham and I got separated
from the others. I thought we were lost.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.264
It could mean she reiterated something
out of order.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.558
Please repeat the last sequence.

09:59.641 --> 10:04.104
Remember to be specific about every
detail, even your feelings at the time.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.440
OK.

10:06.565 --> 10:10.319
I really... don't know
exactly what happened.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.614
There wasn't much time
to stand around hypothesising.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.493
Just after the sun went down,...

10:20.871 --> 10:22.998
..the gliders attacked the village.

10:23.081 --> 10:27.377
We booked for the Stargate, but
the clearing was filled with Jaffa.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.339
SG-15 was already under fiire.

10:39.431 --> 10:42.518
It felt like they were
comin' at us from all sides.

10:44.937 --> 10:46.980
Don't stop! Keep movin'!

10:47.314 --> 10:51.777
Captain Blasdale radioed from behind. He
and Sergeant Lewis were pinned down.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.196
- Get to the gate!
- Sir!

10:54.905 --> 10:57.115
Major!

10:59.159 --> 11:01.703
- How did you feel?
- Are you kidding?

11:03.622 --> 11:05.415
I was scared out of my mind.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.422
Are you certain you shot the Jaffa?

11:21.223 --> 11:22.641
Positive.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.036
She is a Zatarc.
Lieutenant Astor's mind has been altered.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.289
You think so?

11:45.414 --> 11:47.457
What do we do?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.627
There is a procedure we could try.

11:50.752 --> 11:54.590
- Is it safe?
- It is experimental at best.

11:54.673 --> 11:58.844
General, need I remind you what
happened the last time we trusted this...

11:58.927 --> 12:00.554
..woman?

12:00.679 --> 12:03.599
You are referring to
my symbiote Anise, Colonel.

12:03.682 --> 12:07.352
I would not suggest this if I thought
there was a better alternative.

12:07.436 --> 12:11.273
- And the worst-case scenario?
- It will damage the portion of the brain...

12:11.356 --> 12:13.567
..affected by the Zatarc technology.

12:13.692 --> 12:17.196
Lieutenant Astor could lose
more than just her false memory.

12:17.279 --> 12:20.282
- How much more?
- It won't be clear until afterwards.

12:20.407 --> 12:25.204
I hate the idea of deciding the fate of
an officer, but what choice do we have?

12:25.329 --> 12:28.415
The security of this base
and Earth cannot be compromised.

12:28.540 --> 12:34.963
Also, when her programming is triggered,
she will become self-destructive.

12:36.924 --> 12:40.594
Let's give Lieutenant Astor the choice.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.472
Some choice!

12:55.734 --> 12:58.028
I have to admit, I'm a little scared.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.491
Actually, that's not true. I'm terrified.

13:02.574 --> 13:05.118
I understand. Please try to stay calm.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.497
I swear I shot that Jaffa.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.793
Major Graham returned with
Captain Blasdale and Sergeant Lewis.

13:12.918 --> 13:16.421
You said you were surrounded.
Jaffa were everywhere.

13:16.547 --> 13:19.341
Six other SG team members
died that night,...

13:19.424 --> 13:24.054
..yet you and your team managed to
get through the Stargate unharmed.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.598
I thought we were just that good.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.062
I am going to begin.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.203
It hurts.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.043
Stop! Please!

13:57.087 --> 13:59.631
- Stop!
- Stop the procedure.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.678
(screams)

14:17.149 --> 14:18.317
Astor!

14:28.702 --> 14:30.746
- No!
- (gunshot)

14:46.803 --> 14:48.430
Thank you, Doctor.

14:48.555 --> 14:52.226
Both SFs suffered serious injuries,
but they're going to be OK.

14:52.351 --> 14:56.980
The programming must have a fail-safe
that prevents it from being tampered with.

14:57.064 --> 15:00.317
I am sorry you have lost
another member of your team.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.653
I hold myself accountable.

15:02.778 --> 15:05.155
The Goa'uld are ultimately accountable.

15:05.239 --> 15:09.326
We cannot analyse the affected area
of the victim's brain post mortem...

15:09.409 --> 15:13.080
- ..due to the self-inflicted damage.
- Would that make a difference?

15:13.205 --> 15:15.082
I believe it would. Yes.

15:15.165 --> 15:18.418
There will be no summit unless
we are sure the president is safe.

15:18.544 --> 15:21.004
We can complete
the Zatarc testing in time.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.882
And if we find more?

15:23.966 --> 15:28.512
Greater things than the summit will be
in jeopardy, Colonel. Proceed. Dismissed.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.806
Well, this is fun(!) Who's next?

15:30.931 --> 15:32.891
SG-1 .

15:32.975 --> 15:33.976
Dumb.

15:40.065 --> 15:45.028
Good, Colonel. Now let's move
to your mission on PX9-757.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.116
Drawin' a blank.

15:49.199 --> 15:53.453
Your mission was to destroy
a new ship being built by Apophis.

15:53.537 --> 15:55.998
- You know about that.
- The device only works...

15:56.123 --> 15:58.876
..if you recount your exact
memory of the events.

15:59.543 --> 16:01.503
We realised they wouldn't come off.

16:01.587 --> 16:04.464
Jump ahead to the part where
you went through the gate.

16:04.548 --> 16:08.051
We were so fast, the Jaffa on
the other side didn't stand a chance.

16:18.896 --> 16:23.358
General Hammond ordered me to follow.
I went through the gate and to the facility.

16:23.483 --> 16:27.154
So you were alone for some time
before you met up with the rest of SG-1?

16:27.237 --> 16:29.281
Yes.

16:33.202 --> 16:35.496
Um... I went after the naqahdah.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.424
Don't move!

16:51.428 --> 16:54.306
- After that?
- I headed back to meet Jack and Sam.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.770
When I realised Carter
wasn't with me, I stopped.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.741
- Went back for her.
- What happened next?

17:12.866 --> 17:15.493
Your ingenious armband stopped workin'.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.844
You couldn't get
through the shield again?

17:31.969 --> 17:33.053
No.

17:33.554 --> 17:37.808
When I woke up, I saw Colonel O'Neill,
unconscious beyond the force shield.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.811
- I called his name and he woke up.
- Then what?

17:40.894 --> 17:44.231
I realised that there was no way
I was gonna get through.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.358
I told the Colonel to go without me.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.777
- To leave you behind?
- Yes.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.947
The timer on the C4 was counting down.

17:52.072 --> 17:55.742
Without armbands, it was gonna be tight
getting to the Stargate...

17:55.826 --> 18:01.373
- ..before the ship's power core exploded.
- What did Colonel O'Neill do?

18:03.250 --> 18:05.294
Sir, there's no time.

18:05.419 --> 18:07.880
(movement ofarmour)

18:10.340 --> 18:13.927
- Couple of Jaffa came around the corner.
- And then?

18:15.053 --> 18:17.848
- We got lucky.
- That's it?

18:18.390 --> 18:22.853
Yeah. The C4 explosion must have
taken out the shield generator.

18:27.733 --> 18:28.650
Did you see that?

18:28.734 --> 18:32.863
- The force shield disappeared. We ran.
- Sounds easy.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.449
Well, I wouldn't say that.

18:37.326 --> 18:40.412
Are you sure
you're telling me everything?

18:41.997 --> 18:44.374
Oh. I tried to go for the naqahdah.

18:45.584 --> 18:47.544
Carter, forget that! Leave it!

18:47.669 --> 18:50.130
But Colonel O'Neill ordered me to leave it.

18:50.214 --> 18:52.257
That's everything?

18:53.759 --> 18:55.636
Yeah.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.643
You're not serious?

19:21.954 --> 19:23.997
What?

19:24.122 --> 19:26.667
We still don't know about
the targets involved.

19:26.750 --> 19:31.713
In the event that we do proceed, I am
forwarding a new plan for your arrival.

19:31.797 --> 19:35.133
Yes, sir. Both Colonel O'Neill
and Major Carter.

19:36.051 --> 19:39.388
I'll pass that along.
Thank you, Mr President.

19:46.395 --> 19:48.438
Give us a second, huh?

19:50.524 --> 19:53.694
- Sir, this has to be a mistake.
- Tell me about it.

19:53.819 --> 19:56.655
Can you talk to the general
about getting me retested?

19:56.738 --> 19:58.866
Us.

19:58.949 --> 20:01.243
- What?
- Us retested.

20:01.702 --> 20:05.956
Apparently I'm one of those...
Zark things too. I'm across the hall.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.500
- That can't be.
- I know.

20:09.418 --> 20:13.172
- Although we were unconscious together.
- Apparently.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.677
Sir, are you worried that
it's at least possible?

20:19.803 --> 20:21.847
A little.

20:28.353 --> 20:31.523
I do not believe Colonel O'Neill
and Major Carter are Zatarcs.

20:31.648 --> 20:35.152
- We can't prove they aren't.
- We must keep them isolated...

20:35.277 --> 20:38.697
..to prevent them from being
exposed to programming triggers.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.033
- We don't know it's the president.
- No.

20:41.158 --> 20:43.535
Then it means confining them indefinitely.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.371
Until we come up with
another course of action.

20:46.455 --> 20:51.084
The good news is that we have found
no more Zatarcs among SGC personnel.

20:51.210 --> 20:55.130
The high councillor and his advisors
have also been tested back on Vorash.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.257
There is no danger to the summit.

20:57.341 --> 21:00.761
I want good news regarding
Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter.

21:00.886 --> 21:01.970
We'll work on it.

21:02.095 --> 21:05.349
What shall I tell the high councillor
regarding the meeting?

21:05.474 --> 21:07.518
It's on.

21:24.159 --> 21:26.203
- (knock at door)
- Yeah?

21:29.540 --> 21:31.583
Oh. You.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.880
You are probably not happy to see me.

21:37.548 --> 21:43.011
Well, if you're not here to tell me it's all
a big mistake, I might be a little glum.

21:43.095 --> 21:48.308
I have come to apologise. It is
sort of our fault you are a Zatarc.

21:48.392 --> 21:50.519
Maybe a little more Anise than me.

21:50.644 --> 21:53.897
I knew that. I just don't know why yet.

21:54.022 --> 21:57.109
The experiment with the armbands
was the reason you went...

21:57.192 --> 21:59.653
..to destroy Apophis's new ship.

22:03.991 --> 22:05.868
Hey, listen.

22:05.951 --> 22:08.078
What if you're wrong...

22:08.162 --> 22:11.832
- ..and Carter and I aren't really...
- Zatarcs?

22:11.957 --> 22:14.334
I do not believe that is possible.

22:16.086 --> 22:18.130
Swell.

22:23.927 --> 22:27.764
- Is there something else?
- Thank you for saving my life on Vorash.

22:27.890 --> 22:32.936
And you saved me for a second time
during the situation with Lieutenant Astor.

22:33.020 --> 22:35.689
No offence, but I'd have
done it for anyone.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.659
Uh...

22:50.329 --> 22:53.248
- Whatcha doin'?
- I originally came from a planet...

22:53.332 --> 22:56.668
..where the people were not
afraid to show their affection.

22:56.752 --> 22:59.630
- When we wanted to lama-shem...
- Excuse me?

23:00.422 --> 23:03.175
- I believe you call it...
- Something else.

23:03.800 --> 23:08.263
Anise, my symbiote, is far more interested
in Dr Jackson, on an intellectual level,...

23:08.347 --> 23:10.807
..but she would have to suffer.

23:13.393 --> 23:17.773
Look, there are so many reasons
why this is wrong and...

23:18.982 --> 23:21.026
..weird and...

23:22.694 --> 23:26.698
- ..wrong. Did I mention wrong?
- Is it because I share a body with Anise?

23:27.241 --> 23:30.035
- For starters.
- Do you not find me attractive?

23:32.204 --> 23:34.248
Oh, you're...

23:41.171 --> 23:43.215
Hey.

23:44.341 --> 23:46.802
- I could blow any minute.
- If I were the target,...

23:46.885 --> 23:51.056
..your Zatarc programming
would have triggered long ago.

23:52.683 --> 23:54.393
Good point.

23:54.518 --> 23:57.604
Is there someone else
to whom you are loyal?

23:59.064 --> 24:01.900
That's not really the point here, is it?

24:03.318 --> 24:05.946
You have been made
uncomfortable by my offer.

24:06.029 --> 24:08.073
No! No, it's just...

24:09.741 --> 24:12.119
- Well, yeah.
- I had heard the humans of Earth...

24:12.202 --> 24:15.289
..had many inhibitions and stigmas
surrounding intimacy.

24:15.414 --> 24:18.500
Yes... Yes, I've heard that too.

24:20.294 --> 24:23.046
There's also the matter of timing.

24:23.130 --> 24:28.177
I am still quite hopeful we will find
a way to help both you and Major Carter.

24:29.094 --> 24:33.015
Then maybe you should be out
doin' that. What do you think?

24:34.308 --> 24:37.728
Once again, I find myself
feeling the need to apologise.

24:37.811 --> 24:40.355
Oh, no need. We're adults.

24:41.732 --> 24:46.361
I will learn more about your customs, so
I will not make you uncomfortable again.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.780
Yes. Very good idea. Thank you.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.700
Bye.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.470
The president is unhappy with...

25:11.553 --> 25:15.474
.."for the common interests
of the Tok'ra and the humans of Earth".

25:15.557 --> 25:19.937
I'm recommending "in pursuit
of freedom for all individuals".

25:20.020 --> 25:22.648
The high councillor
does not like to generalise.

25:25.984 --> 25:30.072
Excuse me. I have been reviewing
my notes on prior incidents with Zatarcs.

25:30.155 --> 25:33.158
We are endangering
Major Carter and Colonel O'Neill...

25:33.242 --> 25:35.369
- ..by keeping them confined.
- Why?

25:35.452 --> 25:38.080
In at least one case,
the Zatarc lost control...

25:38.163 --> 25:42.167
..when it became evident they could
no longer achieve their objective.

25:42.251 --> 25:45.420
- So by confining them...
- They won't fulfil their programming...

25:45.546 --> 25:48.298
- ..and will self-destruct.
- Why hasn't that happened?

25:48.382 --> 25:51.885
The triggering event hasn't occurred yet.
However, if that passes...

25:52.010 --> 25:54.471
If the high councillor meets the president.

25:54.596 --> 25:57.516
- What if we postpone?
- That could have the same effect.

25:57.599 --> 26:03.105
If the programmed part of their minds
thinks they can no longer fulfil the goal.

26:05.232 --> 26:07.442
So... what do we do?

26:12.531 --> 26:14.825
- Martouf.
- How are you?

26:15.450 --> 26:18.370
- I was just writing to my dad.
- I have sent word to him.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.747
I am sure he will come as soon as he can.

26:20.831 --> 26:23.041
Thank you.

26:23.125 --> 26:27.379
- I have come to present an option to you.
- Not what Freya tried on Lieutenant Astor.

26:27.462 --> 26:30.299
She thinks it failed because
she stopped before the end.

26:30.382 --> 26:35.012
- Because Astor went crazy.
- Freya thinks the fail-safe...

26:35.095 --> 26:38.765
..can be overcome if the procedure
is given a fair chance to work.

26:38.891 --> 26:42.227
- What's the rush?
- Freya has seen evidence that suggests...

26:42.352 --> 26:44.980
..if a Zatarc is prevented
from achieving their aim...

26:45.063 --> 26:50.194
- ..and if that is to target the president...
- You're saying I would try and kill myself.

26:50.319 --> 26:52.029
Yes.

26:52.154 --> 26:54.198
Two days, right?

26:55.532 --> 26:58.202
I guess we wait and see.

26:58.285 --> 27:01.538
Or... you could
go through with the procedure.

27:01.663 --> 27:04.625
Which could cause me to
lose my mind, just like Astor.

27:04.708 --> 27:06.418
- Yes.
- Or it could work...

27:06.543 --> 27:10.464
..and I could still end up
with serious brain damage.

27:10.589 --> 27:12.549
Yes, I know.

27:12.674 --> 27:17.137
Not only do I not want to risk losing
what you still carry of Jolinar, but...

27:17.262 --> 27:20.349
..l've grown quite fond
of you as well, Sam.

27:29.358 --> 27:31.568
It's all based on assumptions, right?

27:31.652 --> 27:33.946
We don't know the president is the target.

27:34.071 --> 27:37.574
We don't know if I'll lose my mind
because I'm stuck in here.

27:37.658 --> 27:43.080
And we don't know for sure that you will
suffer any ill effects from the procedure.

27:44.498 --> 27:46.542
Some choice!

27:53.048 --> 27:54.925
Come again?

27:55.050 --> 27:59.429
Bottom line is there's a chance
you could come out completely intact.

27:59.555 --> 28:02.015
- Or not.
- Or not.

28:06.311 --> 28:08.772
- What's Carter say?
- Uh, I don't know.

28:08.856 --> 28:11.817
Martouf is explaining it to her now.

28:12.776 --> 28:14.653
What would you do?

28:16.864 --> 28:19.158
I honestly don't know.

28:24.496 --> 28:26.790
She made a pass at me.

28:28.083 --> 28:30.460
- Sam?
- Anise.

28:30.544 --> 28:32.171
Freya. One of 'em.

28:34.006 --> 28:35.966
- Really?
- The host half.

28:36.091 --> 28:39.052
Uh... That's odd.

28:39.469 --> 28:43.307
You're tellin' me.
Odd timing too, don't you think?

28:43.432 --> 28:44.516
Yes.

28:47.895 --> 28:51.064
Apparently, the snake likes you.

28:51.732 --> 28:53.150
Really?

29:01.492 --> 29:06.705
Yep, I think these are the Jack O'Neill
moments I will probably miss the most.

29:08.916 --> 29:10.292
- What?
- What?

29:10.375 --> 29:13.128
I understand why they wouldn't trust me.

29:13.212 --> 29:18.008
I think it's more that they would rather
risk dying than lose who they are.

29:18.133 --> 29:19.927
They won't harm the president,...

29:20.052 --> 29:23.222
..but how do we stop them
harming themselves during the summit?

29:23.347 --> 29:26.350
We plan to sedate them
and put them in restraints.

29:26.475 --> 29:28.519
Until when?

29:35.567 --> 29:40.614
It's the only way we can be absolutely
sure you won't try and hurt yourself.

29:40.739 --> 29:43.742
- No choice?
- No.

29:44.535 --> 29:47.621
You won't feel anything.
It'll be like falling asleep.

29:47.746 --> 29:51.083
- For how long?
- As long as it takes to find a treatment...

29:51.208 --> 29:53.752
..with better odds than
the one we have available.

29:53.836 --> 29:57.172
The president is due to arrive
in less than an hour.

30:04.805 --> 30:07.474
Come to say your goodbyes?

30:09.017 --> 30:11.562
If there's anything you require, O'Neill...

30:11.687 --> 30:15.274
- Another option.
- There is still time to try the procedure.

30:20.863 --> 30:23.949
You said if you could have done
a proper autopsy on Astor...

30:24.074 --> 30:26.285
..you might have been able to solve this.

30:26.368 --> 30:29.705
It would have provided
much more information.

30:32.624 --> 30:34.501
- Do it.
- What?

30:36.545 --> 30:40.048
Hey, I've done the drugged-out,
strapped-to-the-bed thing.

30:40.132 --> 30:44.052
And if what happened
to Lieutenant Astor happens to you?

30:46.805 --> 30:48.849
Maybe it'll help Carter.

30:50.559 --> 30:54.062
Her brain's worth a lot more than mine.

31:02.237 --> 31:05.657
- What? He can't!
- He's on his way down now.

31:05.741 --> 31:08.452
- Why is he doing this?
- He'd rather take the risk...

31:08.535 --> 31:10.829
- ..than be put to sleep indefinitely.
- But...

31:10.913 --> 31:15.125
If it happens, he thinks Anise can use
what she would learn to save you.

31:17.377 --> 31:19.254
Sam.

31:19.630 --> 31:21.673
Colonel!

31:32.226 --> 31:34.937
- You have to stop him.
- It's his choice.

31:35.687 --> 31:38.148
Sam, please, I have to do this.

31:48.242 --> 31:50.452
(Stargate alarm)

31:57.167 --> 31:59.211
Incoming traveller.

32:24.987 --> 32:28.574
Jack's going through with the procedure
and they're sedating Sam.

32:28.657 --> 32:30.951
(Tannoy) Receiving Tok'ra IDC.

32:32.202 --> 32:34.246
Open the iris.

32:52.055 --> 32:54.099
Welcome to Earth.

33:00.147 --> 33:03.901
- It's an important occasion for us all.
- Indeed it is.

33:16.914 --> 33:18.957
Janet...

33:46.235 --> 33:48.111
Right.

33:57.913 --> 34:00.666
I was impressed by
your revisions to the treaty.

34:00.749 --> 34:03.210
The credit goes to Dr Jackson.

34:03.293 --> 34:05.587
It's an inspiring document.

34:07.089 --> 34:10.342
I only hope both parties can live up to it.

34:10.425 --> 34:12.386
Dr Jackson?

34:12.511 --> 34:14.221
Yes. Yes, of course.

34:15.013 --> 34:17.850
Sir, Air Force One has just landed.

34:17.933 --> 34:21.436
It will take 15 minutes
for the president's motorcade to arrive.

34:21.520 --> 34:26.315
If you'll excuse me, I'll meet him
at the surface and then be back soon.

34:31.487 --> 34:32.739
Colonel...

34:41.415 --> 34:43.458
Sir, there's no time.

34:46.503 --> 34:48.880
We may have to increase the dose.

34:49.882 --> 34:52.259
C4's gonna go.
You have to get outta here.

34:52.342 --> 34:53.427
No!

34:55.429 --> 34:57.973
The machine is wrong.

34:59.474 --> 35:02.561
You... don't understand.

35:02.644 --> 35:04.855
We lied.

35:05.355 --> 35:07.816
We didn't even know we were lying.

35:07.941 --> 35:09.568
Please.

35:11.862 --> 35:13.822
If you are ready, we will begin.

35:19.620 --> 35:21.497
Stop!

35:35.677 --> 35:38.138
Carter? What's up?

35:38.222 --> 35:40.933
Could we have a moment alone, please?

35:44.186 --> 35:46.230
Thanks.

35:46.855 --> 35:49.608
Carter, undo this thing.

35:54.822 --> 35:57.991
- What's goin' on?
- We're not Zatarcs.

36:00.410 --> 36:02.454
How do you know?

36:02.538 --> 36:05.874
The machine thinks that we have
false memories, but we don't.

36:05.999 --> 36:08.919
- We were lying.
- I wasn't lying.

36:09.002 --> 36:12.840
- OK, you left something out.
- No, I didn't.

36:13.465 --> 36:16.802
Sir, when you wouldn't leave me,...

36:19.596 --> 36:24.560
..are you sure there wasn't
something else that you're not admitting?

36:25.435 --> 36:27.563
What are you talkin' about?

36:27.646 --> 36:32.526
Something we can't admit, given our
working relationship or military ranks?

36:32.651 --> 36:34.862
Oh.

36:34.945 --> 36:37.072
Oh, that.

36:37.197 --> 36:39.950
Sir, we weren't telling the whole truth,...

36:40.033 --> 36:44.496
..and that's why the machine
thinks the memories are false.

36:44.621 --> 36:46.498
Really?

36:55.048 --> 36:56.425
Retest him.

37:05.017 --> 37:06.185
Mr President.

37:06.310 --> 37:09.146
- General, nice to see you.
- Good to see you, sir.

37:09.605 --> 37:13.108
Major Carter was trapped
behind the force shield.

37:13.984 --> 37:14.902
That's right.

37:21.867 --> 37:23.994
Sir, there's no time.

37:24.119 --> 37:26.413
(movement ofarmour)

37:29.416 --> 37:32.753
- There were sounds.
- You did everything you could?

37:33.795 --> 37:36.173
- Yes.
- You couldn't save her?

37:38.008 --> 37:41.094
- No.
- But you still could have saved yourself?

37:42.471 --> 37:43.639
I guess.

37:46.642 --> 37:49.394
- Sir...
- I know, I know!

37:49.937 --> 37:51.980
What happened next?

37:54.983 --> 37:57.653
- Sir, just go!
- No!

38:08.705 --> 38:10.749
(footsteps approach)

38:14.253 --> 38:18.799
- What were you feeling?
- Like someone who was about to die.

38:23.303 --> 38:25.514
Sir...

38:37.776 --> 38:39.820
I didn't leave...

38:43.198 --> 38:48.162
..because I'd have rather died
myself... than lose Carter.

38:51.874 --> 38:54.960
- Why?
- Because I care about her.

38:59.214 --> 39:02.009
A lot more than I'm supposed to.

39:07.472 --> 39:09.766
You are not a Zatarc.

39:17.608 --> 39:19.651
Now retest me.

39:23.530 --> 39:25.824
You are also not a Zatarc.

39:27.159 --> 39:28.619
Thank you.

39:36.084 --> 39:38.378
- Carter...
- Sir,...

39:40.005 --> 39:42.925
..none of this has to leave this room.

39:43.550 --> 39:46.011
- We're OK with that?
- Yes, sir.

39:49.389 --> 39:52.809
If they're not Zatarcs,
they're no threat to the president.

39:52.893 --> 39:57.773
- Oh, I have some questions for him.
- Every SGC personnel has been tested.

39:57.856 --> 40:02.903
Even the high councillor and his guard
were tested on Vorash before they came.

40:03.028 --> 40:06.615
Hey, what about you? You ever
been tested on that thing?

40:06.740 --> 40:08.700
I have not been in any situations...

40:08.784 --> 40:12.830
..where I would be vulnerable
to the Goa'uld Zatarc technology.

40:12.913 --> 40:14.623
What about Martouf?

40:26.510 --> 40:28.554
(whispers)

40:44.695 --> 40:46.738
Excuse me.

40:52.494 --> 40:54.872
Martouf, can I talk to you outside?

40:54.955 --> 40:59.918
Supreme High Councillor Per'sus of the
Tok'ra, may I introduce the president of...

41:00.919 --> 41:02.171
Look out!

41:28.655 --> 41:31.116
Hold your fire!

41:39.625 --> 41:41.251
Samantha...

41:56.683 --> 41:58.727
We're all clear.

42:01.021 --> 42:02.981
Is everyone OK?

42:03.482 --> 42:05.526
- Per'sus?
- Yes.

42:06.860 --> 42:09.738
- Is the president all right?
- He's OK.

42:09.822 --> 42:12.783
But I'm afraid this man isn't the president.

42:12.866 --> 42:16.620
The real president is still waiting
for our signal in Air Force One.

42:16.703 --> 42:19.790
- We had to be absolutely sure.
- I see.

42:21.458 --> 42:25.671
May that be the last time such a deception
is required by either of us.

42:28.715 --> 42:33.345
I promise you, his death will
ultimately prove to be a noble sacrifice.

42:34.305 --> 42:40.869
