WEBVTT

00:00.209 --> 00:02.677
We can't have you showing up
for the Battle of Saratoga

00:02.678 --> 00:04.980
missing a button, can we?

00:04.981 --> 00:07.249
There we are.

00:07.250 --> 00:10.518
Oh.

00:11.821 --> 00:15.993
Betsy Ross herself would envy
your handiwork, Miss Caroline.

00:16.192 --> 00:21.932
I made you some new shirts,
breeches and hose,

00:21.933 --> 00:24.882
all cut from cloth woven
on a heritage Saxony loom.

00:24.883 --> 00:26.268
- Oh.
- (laughs)

00:26.269 --> 00:29.519
I also brought you butter
I churned last night

00:29.520 --> 00:31.067
and some lingonberry preserves.

00:31.068 --> 00:33.542
And...

00:33.543 --> 00:35.677
Oh, Miss Caroline.

00:35.678 --> 00:38.531
Your generosity knows no bounds.

00:38.532 --> 00:40.933
I shall treasure these gifts.

00:40.934 --> 00:44.336
I've never met anyone
like you before, Ichabod.

00:44.337 --> 00:46.972
Your dedication to Colonial reenactment

00:46.973 --> 00:49.408
is so impressive.

00:49.409 --> 00:50.710
You never break character...

00:50.711 --> 00:53.060
Well, one might say it's a way of life.

00:53.061 --> 00:54.080
I think it's inspiring,

00:54.081 --> 00:58.050
and to be honest, kind of... attractive.

00:58.952 --> 01:00.419
Oh.

01:00.420 --> 01:04.271
Uh, Miss Caroline, words cannot
express how flattered I am.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.838
Then don't use words.

01:05.839 --> 01:07.506
I'm a married man.

01:07.507 --> 01:10.009
Oh.

01:10.010 --> 01:12.611
(sighs) I'm so sorry.

01:12.612 --> 01:14.513
- No...
- You live alone, you never talk about her.

01:14.514 --> 01:15.890
There's no photos of her around.

01:15.891 --> 01:17.359
I assumed you were single

01:17.360 --> 01:19.227
or separated or a widower.

01:19.228 --> 01:23.064
No... I assure you my
wife is alive and well.

01:23.065 --> 01:25.066
(door opens)

01:26.969 --> 01:29.104
Didn't mean to interrupt.

01:29.105 --> 01:30.972
I am such an idiot. This is not

01:30.973 --> 01:32.607
what it looks like, Mrs. Crane.

01:32.608 --> 01:34.209
- Mrs. who now?
- Oh!

01:34.210 --> 01:37.579
No, no, uh, Miss Mills is my partner.

01:37.580 --> 01:38.980
Uh, not-not life partner.

01:38.981 --> 01:41.649
She's my... We... Oh, look!

01:41.650 --> 01:44.619
She comes bearing a selection
of delicacies from the Far East.

01:44.620 --> 01:46.755
Commonly known as Yummy Food Schezuan.

01:46.756 --> 01:48.690
I'll be going now. Excuse me.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.992
- Oh, Miss Caroline. Please...
- Thanks.

01:52.228 --> 01:55.030
We need a signal.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.953
Need to hang a tie on the
doorknob or something.

01:56.954 --> 01:57.832
(laughs)

01:57.833 --> 02:00.001
Lieutenant, you are making light

02:00.002 --> 02:01.703
of a very uncomfortable situation.

02:01.704 --> 02:04.172
I was regretfully unaware

02:04.173 --> 02:07.393
of Miss Caroline's...
affections... for me.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.701
Ah. Anyone could tell

02:08.702 --> 02:10.786
that girl had a case
of Crane on the brain.

02:10.834 --> 02:13.948
Well... I have had much

02:13.949 --> 02:15.884
weighing on my mind, so...

02:15.885 --> 02:18.753
It's Katrina. You're worried about her.

02:18.754 --> 02:22.103
Thoughts of my wife in
peril do plague me.

02:22.104 --> 02:22.857
Look...

02:22.858 --> 02:25.493
she chose to stay with
the Horseman, Crane.

02:26.328 --> 02:28.196
She can handle herself.

ABRAHAM: Katrina, where are you?

03:18.447 --> 03:20.482
Good afternoon, Abraham.

03:20.483 --> 03:21.983
I trust all is well.

03:21.984 --> 03:24.886
Why wouldn't it be?

03:24.887 --> 03:27.288
Pleasantry, nothing more.

03:28.624 --> 03:32.794
These comforts you meant
procured for me are appreciated.

03:35.364 --> 03:38.399
When you are my queen,
you will want for nothing.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.436
All the world's riches will be yours.

03:41.437 --> 03:43.905
I've never been one for
material things, Abraham.

03:43.906 --> 03:47.175
I'm not talking about
baubles or trinkets.

03:48.444 --> 03:52.247
The coming apocalypse is a certainty.

03:52.248 --> 03:57.051
Your only chance of weathering
the storm is by my side.

03:57.052 --> 03:59.554
I know what you desire.

03:59.555 --> 04:01.890
And you know that I want you

04:01.891 --> 04:05.727
to make that choice willingly.

04:10.132 --> 04:13.167
But I will not wait forever.

04:17.606 --> 04:19.807
(door closes)

04:24.647 --> 04:26.981
(eerie whoosh)

04:26.982 --> 04:29.250
To what do I owe the pleasure?

04:29.251 --> 04:30.852
The enchantment you cast on my home

04:30.853 --> 04:32.253
to keep Katrina from
using her witchcraft...

04:32.254 --> 04:34.956
I suspect she's trying
to work around it.

04:34.957 --> 04:37.258
I need you to check on her for me.

04:37.259 --> 04:39.460
She's a powerful and devious witch.

04:39.461 --> 04:41.196
Hmm.

04:41.197 --> 04:44.165
I'll examine the wards and,
if necessary, strengthen them,

04:44.166 --> 04:47.168
and... then, if she's
still causing trouble,

04:47.169 --> 04:49.537
we can use the binding ritual.

04:51.173 --> 04:52.640
There will be no need.

04:52.641 --> 04:54.542
I will turn her to our purpose
as Moloch commanded.

04:54.543 --> 04:56.878
She'll play the role that
he has devised for her,

04:56.879 --> 04:59.681
and she will do so of her own volition.

04:59.682 --> 05:01.349
It's a difficult proposition,

05:01.350 --> 05:04.719
unless you sever her bond with Crane.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.087
Your help will not be necessary.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.488
It's no trouble.

05:07.489 --> 05:11.159
I relish any chance to
cause my parents pain.

05:11.160 --> 05:15.296
What I have asked of you
is all that I require.

05:16.465 --> 05:18.599
(eerie whoosh)

05:35.918 --> 05:38.386
Come on, Katrina.

05:38.387 --> 05:42.857
Must be some sin I can make use of.

I'm not about to go any further.

06:19.595 --> 06:21.329
(distant weeping)

06:21.330 --> 06:23.831
Wait, wait, wait. Did you hear that?

06:23.832 --> 06:26.668
All I hear is rain.

06:26.669 --> 06:28.102
Oh, well, for a second,

06:28.103 --> 06:30.571
it sounded like someone
was out there crying.

06:31.540 --> 06:35.981
Okay, if you think that trying
to freak me out is gonna

06:35.982 --> 06:38.046
get you past second base
and into my pants, you are...

06:38.047 --> 06:40.915
No, no, I'm not trying
to get in your pants.

06:40.916 --> 06:42.850
I-I mean, I-I am...

06:42.851 --> 06:44.385
(shrieking)

06:44.386 --> 06:46.621
Oh, my God.

06:46.622 --> 06:50.458
Oh, my God! Go, go, go!

06:58.801 --> 07:00.891
Just send her a text.

07:00.892 --> 07:02.860
It's the way it's done these days.

07:02.861 --> 07:06.163
A missive composed by thumb can
not adequately convey emotion.

07:06.164 --> 07:07.631
Hence, emoticons.

07:07.632 --> 07:11.168
Oh, yes... a grimacing
lemon caricature.

07:11.169 --> 07:12.536
That should do the trick.

07:12.537 --> 07:15.639
No, I've hurt Miss Caroline's feelings,

07:15.640 --> 07:18.375
and I intend to apologize face-to-face,

07:18.376 --> 07:21.078
as a gentleman should.

07:23.214 --> 07:25.315
(knocking)

07:28.920 --> 07:32.022
Please forgive the
intrusion, Miss Caroline,

07:32.023 --> 07:33.824
but I must beg your pardon

07:33.825 --> 07:37.234
for the events that transpired earlier.

07:37.235 --> 07:39.803
Oh, I'm the one that made
a total ass of myself.

07:39.804 --> 07:41.204
No, it was a misunderstanding.

07:41.205 --> 07:44.541
And one I pray we can put behind us.

07:45.376 --> 07:47.077
Truth be told,

07:47.078 --> 07:51.514
I have precious few
friends in Sleepy Hollow.

07:52.517 --> 07:54.659
And none that share my fervor

07:54.660 --> 07:56.186
for the Colonial way of life.

07:56.187 --> 07:57.888
(laughs)

07:57.889 --> 08:00.123
Of course we can be friends, Ichabod.

08:00.124 --> 08:02.726
I'm flattered that you
would come all this way

08:02.727 --> 08:05.128
to make things right.

08:09.767 --> 08:13.269
I'm grateful for your understanding.

08:15.406 --> 08:19.309
I'll see you next Saturday
at the Battle of Saratoga.

08:35.226 --> 08:39.361
(water gurgling, woman weeping)

08:45.369 --> 08:48.271
(woman weeping)

08:51.209 --> 08:53.410
Oh.

Sync and corrections by awaqeded

09:34.174 --> 09:35.396
Let me pass.

09:35.692 --> 09:37.860
No. I'm with the lieutenant. Lieutenant!

09:37.861 --> 09:39.429
Lieutenant!

09:39.430 --> 09:40.997
Let him in.

09:43.133 --> 09:44.667
Oh, no.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.937
Oh, no.

09:47.938 --> 09:50.640
(sighs) You're certain it's her?

09:50.641 --> 09:52.809
You're certain it's Caroline?

09:52.810 --> 09:54.420
I I.D.'d her myself.

09:54.421 --> 09:57.283
Fisherman found the body
at 5:00 this morning.

09:58.048 --> 10:01.584
- I'm so sorry, Crane.
- We only saw her yesterday evening.

10:01.585 --> 10:04.053
(sighs)

10:04.054 --> 10:06.556
Who would do this?

10:06.557 --> 10:08.791
And why?

10:09.834 --> 10:12.795
The examiner put the time
of death at 9:00 p.m.,

10:12.796 --> 10:14.997
which is when we left her place.

10:14.998 --> 10:16.729
The cops that went by
her house said that

10:16.730 --> 10:17.790
the car was in the garage.

10:17.791 --> 10:20.636
So, she walked here...
in the middle of the night.

10:20.637 --> 10:22.004
Apparently.

10:22.005 --> 10:23.873
But there were no tracks on the banks,

10:23.874 --> 10:25.942
no traces of where the
body went into the water.

10:25.943 --> 10:27.376
We're leagues away from town.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.947
It's not likely that anyone
saw or heard anything

10:30.948 --> 10:33.149
that might aid our investigation.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.786
Theory:

10:36.787 --> 10:39.088
she went in further upstream,

10:39.089 --> 10:42.158
floated down to where we discovered her.

10:43.494 --> 10:46.295
An astute observation.

10:46.296 --> 10:50.433
We would be best served
starting our search this way.

10:56.807 --> 10:59.375
This belonged to Caroline.

10:59.376 --> 11:01.911
She was holding it when
we saw her last night.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.880
Crane.

11:03.881 --> 11:06.149
You need to come look at this.

11:06.150 --> 11:09.418
(sighs) Maybe someone was
here last night, after all.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.255
Tire tracks but no footprints,

11:12.256 --> 11:14.090
so they didn't get out the car.

11:14.091 --> 11:17.059
But, see, the dirt is soft and loose,

11:17.060 --> 11:19.529
like they accelerated in a hurry.

11:19.530 --> 11:23.432
Could this vehicle belong
to Caroline's assailant

11:23.433 --> 11:26.536
or to someone who might
have witnessed anything

11:26.537 --> 11:27.770
in last night's tragic events?

11:27.771 --> 11:29.338
I'm thinking teenagers.

11:29.339 --> 11:31.407
Local kids use this
spot as a lovers' lane.

11:31.408 --> 11:33.009
It's a place where, uh, young...

11:33.010 --> 11:34.810
Yes. I had them in my day.

11:34.811 --> 11:36.279
A route on which a young man

11:36.280 --> 11:39.415
and his betrothed could
walk hand in hand,

11:39.416 --> 11:41.617
closely followed by their
parents, of course,

11:41.618 --> 11:43.052
avoid impropriety.

11:43.053 --> 11:46.289
Something like that.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.090
Well, if it was high school students,

11:48.091 --> 11:50.393
I'd say a visit to the
queen bees is in order.

11:50.394 --> 11:55.031
I take it you're suggesting
more than a visit to an apiary.

11:55.032 --> 11:56.265
<i>(school bell rings)</i>

11:56.266 --> 11:57.934
The point is there's an apex

11:57.935 --> 11:59.602
to the high school food chain,

11:59.603 --> 12:01.204
a top of the heap.

12:01.205 --> 12:03.172
Uh, and you suppose these young women

12:03.173 --> 12:05.575
will know the identities of the
youths parked by the river

12:05.576 --> 12:07.877
- last night?
- Absolutely. This is where

12:07.878 --> 12:09.812
the gossip grapevine begins and ends...

12:09.813 --> 12:11.714
Spirit Squad.

12:11.715 --> 12:15.885
Well, I'm duly impressed
with their... spirit.

12:15.886 --> 12:17.320
(school bell rings)

12:17.321 --> 12:19.488
ABBIE: Pom-Poms over
there said that you told her

12:19.489 --> 12:21.557
you were parked under
the bridge last night.

12:21.558 --> 12:24.193
A very good friend
of mine lost her life.

12:24.194 --> 12:27.396
Drowned in that river.

12:27.397 --> 12:29.398
You saw something.

12:30.801 --> 12:32.635
We just thought it was a prank,

12:32.636 --> 12:33.769
someone messing with us.

12:33.770 --> 12:36.672
I know it sounds crazy, but...

12:36.673 --> 12:38.841
It was the Weeping Lady.

12:40.244 --> 12:42.078
ABBIE: The Weeping Lady. Local legend.

12:42.079 --> 12:43.412
Goes back to colonial days.

12:43.413 --> 12:45.348
She's the ghost of a woman who drowned

12:45.349 --> 12:46.682
in the Blind Brook River.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.784
Dripping wet, glowing
green eyes, whole nine.

12:48.785 --> 12:50.386
And the tears?

12:50.387 --> 12:52.755
Was some injustice done to her?

12:52.756 --> 12:55.324
She was jilted by her husband
or lover, maybe both.

12:55.325 --> 12:57.727
I don't remember the details.

12:57.728 --> 12:58.861
Which is why we're here.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.130
The legend goes back to a short story

13:01.131 --> 13:03.332
written by a town
resident, back in the day.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.868
Sleepy Hollow Library has
the most extensive collection

13:05.869 --> 13:07.737
of source material.

13:07.738 --> 13:10.906
Hits in Fiction and...

13:10.907 --> 13:13.676
History.

13:14.144 --> 13:16.579
We divide and conquer.

13:22.119 --> 13:23.919
(wings flapping)

13:23.920 --> 13:24.920
(tapping)

13:24.921 --> 13:26.522
(crow caws)

13:26.523 --> 13:28.858
(tapping)

13:42.239 --> 13:44.206
"My darling Ichabod,

13:44.207 --> 13:46.142
"I am safe and in good
health. While my craft

13:46.143 --> 13:48.311
"is limited by my captors,
I have strength enough

13:48.312 --> 13:50.379
"to send you this winged messenger.

13:50.380 --> 13:53.449
"You are always in my thoughts, my love.

13:53.450 --> 13:55.051
"Yours...

13:55.052 --> 13:57.620
Katrina."

14:00.791 --> 14:03.726
And here I thought your
partner was the history buff.

14:03.727 --> 14:05.161
Hawley.

14:05.162 --> 14:06.495
- What are you doing here?
- You know,

14:06.496 --> 14:08.164
just doing what people do at libraries...

14:08.165 --> 14:09.965
free copies, free Internet.

14:09.966 --> 14:11.567
I'm doing some research

14:11.568 --> 14:14.704
on things that go bump in the night.

14:14.705 --> 14:15.738
Way I figure,

14:15.739 --> 14:17.673
forewarned is forearmed.

14:17.674 --> 14:19.742
You know what I mean?

14:19.743 --> 14:21.610
I think I do.

14:22.379 --> 14:24.529
That icy wind I'm feeling,

14:24.530 --> 14:26.546
is that anything to do
with the other day?

14:26.547 --> 14:27.397
By "the other day,"

14:27.398 --> 14:29.704
you mean when Crane and I asked
you to help us take down

14:29.705 --> 14:33.255
a vicious child-stealing
creature and you said no?

14:33.256 --> 14:35.224
I told you when I met
you that I do the work

14:35.225 --> 14:36.892
I'm contracted to do.

14:36.893 --> 14:39.228
And, look, it all came out in the wash.

14:39.229 --> 14:40.262
No thanks to you.

14:40.263 --> 14:41.252
No thanks not to me. Who knows?

14:41.253 --> 14:44.133
Look, if I'd have come with, I
could've blown the whole thing.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.368
Cut me some slack, okay?

14:45.369 --> 14:47.203
It was my first real, live monster.

14:47.204 --> 14:49.472
You deal in supernatural
armaments, Hawley.

14:49.473 --> 14:50.806
Do people who sell Christmas trees

14:50.807 --> 14:52.341
all believe in Santa Claus?

14:52.342 --> 14:54.877
Look, I get that you're
sore about the piper thing,

14:54.878 --> 14:56.312
so let me make it up to you.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.147
Next time you and the
British guy have a critter

14:58.148 --> 15:01.016
you need help with, give me a shout.

15:01.017 --> 15:02.151
I'll see what I can do.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.320
At a very sizeable discount.

15:05.021 --> 15:06.322
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

15:06.323 --> 15:09.692
It's on the house.

15:10.594 --> 15:13.729
If you need me, I'm down
at the pier. Slip 44.

15:18.769 --> 15:21.070
(woman weeping)

15:25.375 --> 15:27.910
(weeping continues)

15:38.188 --> 15:41.323
(weeping continues)

15:45.362 --> 15:46.996
Put your hands up.

15:49.266 --> 15:52.568
Turn around slowly.

15:57.107 --> 15:59.208
(growling)

15:59.209 --> 16:00.142
(gasps)

16:00.143 --> 16:01.944
(screeching)

16:04.681 --> 16:06.515
Lieutenant?!

16:06.516 --> 16:07.850
No!

16:07.851 --> 16:09.452
Lieutenant!

16:09.453 --> 16:11.821
(muffled): Lieutenant!

16:11.822 --> 16:13.722
(muffled shrieking)

16:14.324 --> 16:17.459
(muffled): Lieutenant!

16:19.095 --> 16:20.830
(gasps)

16:20.831 --> 16:23.098
(muffled shrieking)

16:33.310 --> 16:35.511
(muffled shout)

16:37.747 --> 16:39.548
(muffled shrieking)

16:40.817 --> 16:43.953
(grunting)

16:43.954 --> 16:45.888
(panting)

16:45.889 --> 16:47.122
No, Lieutenant!

16:47.123 --> 16:50.059
No, no, no, no, no, no... Abbie!

16:50.060 --> 16:51.260
HAWLEY: What are you waiting for?

16:51.261 --> 16:52.261
Give her mouth-to-mouth, man!

16:52.262 --> 16:54.163
She's drowned!

16:59.736 --> 17:02.137
Come on. Come on.

17:02.973 --> 17:04.873
Please, please, please.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.108
(coughing)

17:12.348 --> 17:14.883
(panting)

17:21.016 --> 17:23.517
(police radio chatter)

17:25.420 --> 17:27.621
(phone vibrates)

17:28.817 --> 17:31.485
I got to go see a guy about a thing.

17:31.486 --> 17:33.954
You got this, right?

17:33.955 --> 17:36.724
I do indeed.

17:36.725 --> 17:39.259
And you're welcome.

17:46.902 --> 17:48.802
Well...

17:48.803 --> 17:51.605
you look none the worse for wear.

17:51.606 --> 17:54.575
Waterlogged but back in action.

17:54.576 --> 17:57.044
Thankfully.

17:57.045 --> 17:58.646
Whilst you were

17:58.647 --> 18:01.982
being ministered to
by the... mobile doctors,

18:01.983 --> 18:05.219
I searched for information
on your assailant.

18:05.220 --> 18:06.353
What'd you get?

18:06.354 --> 18:08.355
I'm afraid we may have

18:08.356 --> 18:10.491
more questions than answers.

18:10.492 --> 18:13.060
<i>The original tale was written in 1779</i>

18:13.061 --> 18:16.697
by local innkeeper Obadiah
Saunders, who claimed

18:16.698 --> 18:19.566
to have been inspired by
the sight of a mournful spirit

18:19.567 --> 18:22.369
stalking the banks of
the Blind Brook River.

18:22.370 --> 18:23.971
He depicts

18:23.972 --> 18:26.874
a jilted woman who drowns herself

18:26.875 --> 18:30.077
when she discovers her
paramour has fallen for another.

18:30.078 --> 18:31.679
Her spirit haunts

18:31.680 --> 18:33.414
the site of her tragic suicide,

18:33.415 --> 18:38.152
weeping in sorrow at the
terrible lot life has dealt her.

18:38.153 --> 18:42.289
Whatever attacked me and killed
Caroline was no sorrowful ghost.

18:42.290 --> 18:45.626
No. And it appears to have
an inordinate interest

18:45.627 --> 18:49.496
in harming those for
whom I most deeply care.

18:50.732 --> 18:53.009
The only tangible piece

18:53.010 --> 18:54.778
of evidence we have to go on

18:54.779 --> 18:57.414
is this.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.787
Where did this come from?

19:03.788 --> 19:05.622
It's a piece of the Weeping Lady's shawl.

19:05.623 --> 19:08.391
Tore when she tried to drown me with it.

19:08.392 --> 19:11.661
This makes no sense.

19:12.230 --> 19:14.297
Why would the creature have this?

19:14.298 --> 19:15.832
It's just a piece of lace.

19:15.833 --> 19:19.236
A piece of lace handwoven
from Scottish cotton.

19:19.237 --> 19:22.906
A specific pattern made
with painstaking care.

19:22.907 --> 19:25.809
You've seen it before.

19:26.783 --> 19:30.180
It belonged to a woman
I knew many years ago,

19:30.181 --> 19:33.450
one to whom I was promised.

19:33.451 --> 19:35.719
This is a verdant and bountiful plot,

19:35.720 --> 19:38.421
a perfect setting for you
and Abraham to begin

19:38.422 --> 19:40.657
- a new life together.
- Ichabod!

19:40.658 --> 19:43.193
(giggling)

19:43.194 --> 19:44.828
Mary.

19:44.829 --> 19:46.162
Surprise.

19:46.163 --> 19:47.964
Uh...

19:47.965 --> 19:50.133
this is... unexpected.

19:50.134 --> 19:52.369
(giggling)

19:52.370 --> 19:55.438
Um... uh, Mary Wells,
Katrina Van Tassel,

19:55.439 --> 19:57.574
treasured friend of mine and betrothed

19:57.575 --> 19:59.910
to my comrade-in-arms,
Abraham Van Brunt.

19:59.911 --> 20:02.612
- A pleasure to meet you, Miss Wells.
- Charmed.

20:02.613 --> 20:05.215
CRANE: Mary is a dear
friend from London.

20:05.216 --> 20:08.318
I've only just arrived on a Dutch
East India Company trawler.

20:08.319 --> 20:10.520
And you came... for...

20:10.521 --> 20:13.857
You, Ichabod. To bring you home,

20:13.858 --> 20:17.260
so you can finally make
an honest woman of me.

20:17.261 --> 20:19.095
You're engaged?

20:19.096 --> 20:20.497
- Uh...
- Promised to each other

20:20.498 --> 20:21.798
since we were children.

20:21.799 --> 20:23.700
Our fathers have long
been close companions.

20:23.701 --> 20:26.436
But Mary and I have not seen one another

20:26.437 --> 20:28.204
since I departed for the Colonies.

20:28.205 --> 20:31.174
- (chuckles)
- Why don't I give the two of you

20:31.175 --> 20:33.643
a chance to reacquaint.

20:37.148 --> 20:39.816
- Well...
- (chuckles)

20:39.817 --> 20:43.954
I must admit, I am confused
by your presence here, Mary.

20:43.955 --> 20:45.689
How could I not come?

20:45.690 --> 20:48.325
Once I heard you'd been coerced
to throw in with the colonists.

20:48.326 --> 20:50.961
Not to worry.

20:50.962 --> 20:52.963
Papa Wells can fix it.

20:52.964 --> 20:54.264
As long as you recant.

20:54.265 --> 20:55.899
I have no intention
of recanting my belief

20:55.900 --> 20:57.734
- under any circumstances...
- You mean you had no intention

20:57.735 --> 20:59.202
until you laid eyes on me again.

20:59.203 --> 21:02.539
But seeing me now,

21:02.540 --> 21:04.341
your heart still beats for me.

21:04.342 --> 21:06.076
As it always did.

21:06.077 --> 21:08.111
Uh, Mary...

21:08.112 --> 21:10.013
before I left London,

21:10.014 --> 21:12.449
we had a mutual agreement
to break off our engagement.

21:12.450 --> 21:14.517
A noble gesture on your part.

21:14.518 --> 21:16.319
To spare me the worry

21:16.320 --> 21:18.421
that you might get
wounded or killed in battle.

21:18.422 --> 21:20.590
No, Mar... (sighs)

21:20.591 --> 21:23.526
As I said then, I care
for you very deeply.

21:23.527 --> 21:26.730
And I for you. Deeply.

21:26.731 --> 21:29.766
But it is as a brother
cares for a sister.

21:32.103 --> 21:34.037
(stifled sob)

21:42.613 --> 21:45.015
Ever since you left,
my f-feelings for you

21:45.016 --> 21:47.417
have only grown deeper.

21:47.418 --> 21:49.452
I had hoped yours had done the same.

21:49.453 --> 21:51.655
Mary, I'm sorry.

21:51.656 --> 21:54.658
I am.

21:54.659 --> 21:57.961
But our lives must remain
on separate paths.

21:57.962 --> 22:01.831
It's her, isn't it?

22:01.832 --> 22:03.633
That dreadful wench.

22:03.634 --> 22:05.068
Katrina.

22:05.069 --> 22:06.836
She's stolen your heart.

22:06.837 --> 22:07.837
Stolen you away.

22:07.838 --> 22:09.973
She's engaged to my best friend.

22:09.974 --> 22:11.775
But it's you she desires.

22:11.776 --> 22:15.678
Not that she will ever have you.

22:16.847 --> 22:19.249
I know you, Ichabod.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.151
You're too kind.

22:21.152 --> 22:23.820
Too noble.

22:23.821 --> 22:26.589
You would never shame our families.

22:26.590 --> 22:29.993
Never leave me a broken
and defamed woman.

22:29.994 --> 22:32.562
Mary, please... be reasonable.

22:32.563 --> 22:35.698
But it's you that must
come to your senses.

22:37.268 --> 22:39.736
I'll be at the inn at dockside.

22:41.072 --> 22:43.840
Expect you by morning.

22:43.841 --> 22:47.343
With your bags packed and
prepared for the journey home.

22:51.315 --> 22:53.483
She sounds like a piece of work.

22:53.484 --> 22:56.086
She was...

22:56.087 --> 22:57.887
intense with her emotions.

22:57.888 --> 23:00.623
But I assumed I'd reached her because

23:00.624 --> 23:03.126
the following day I received a letter

23:03.127 --> 23:04.961
<i>apologizing for her behavior</i>

23:04.962 --> 23:08.832
<i>and releasing me from any obligation.</i>

23:08.833 --> 23:13.236
She said she intended to
return to England immediately.

23:14.004 --> 23:16.839
Is there a chance that she never left?

23:17.608 --> 23:20.143
Somehow Mary is the spirit

23:20.144 --> 23:23.046
that has haunted Sleepy
Hollow for 200 years?

23:23.047 --> 23:25.715
That is a mystery we must solve.

23:25.716 --> 23:28.685
There is a pattern here, Crane.
You said it yourself.

23:28.686 --> 23:31.387
She attacked Caroline. Then me.

23:31.388 --> 23:33.857
If this is Mary we're dealing with,

23:33.858 --> 23:36.092
she could be a literal
green-eyed monster.

23:36.093 --> 23:39.562
One of the reasons I
broke off our engagement

23:39.563 --> 23:41.831
was, indeed, Mary's jealousy.

23:41.832 --> 23:44.234
She was irrationally possessive.

23:44.235 --> 23:46.703
Any woman to whom I so much as spoke

23:46.704 --> 23:49.239
was trying to steal me away.

23:49.240 --> 23:53.943
Weeping Lady's always been
a harmless, benign spirit.

23:53.944 --> 23:55.512
Now she's angry

23:55.513 --> 23:57.046
and tangible.

23:57.047 --> 23:59.816
Something's changed.

23:59.817 --> 24:01.384
She's tried to kill
women that she thought

24:01.385 --> 24:02.852
were trying to steal you away.

24:02.853 --> 24:04.988
What about the one that did?

24:08.859 --> 24:11.260
Where'd it go?

24:12.696 --> 24:16.132
Katrina sent a bird
bearing a message for me.

24:16.133 --> 24:18.768
I'm assuming that's not
some Colonial euphemism.

24:18.769 --> 24:20.937
I put the note here before I reached

24:20.938 --> 24:24.207
into the watery portal to pull you out.

24:24.208 --> 24:25.909
If you lost it then...

24:25.910 --> 24:29.379
Then the Weeping Lady
may have discovered it

24:29.380 --> 24:32.081
and learned that Katrina
is alive and well

24:32.082 --> 24:35.752
and that we are together
and very much in love.

24:35.753 --> 24:37.921
And if this is Mary
we're talking about...

24:37.922 --> 24:41.090
Then Katrina's at the
top of her hit list.

24:52.937 --> 24:55.071
(muffled scream)

24:57.289 --> 24:59.436
Lieutenant, we're wasting time here.

24:59.437 --> 25:03.106
If Katrina is indeed in peril,
we must warn her, protect her.

25:03.107 --> 25:04.941
Going off half-cocked isn't
gonna solve the problem.

25:04.942 --> 25:06.309
You want to protect Katrina?

25:06.310 --> 25:08.245
We need a way to take
the Weeping Lady down.

25:08.246 --> 25:09.946
Well, I didn't order a pizza.

25:09.947 --> 25:11.548
Sorry to bother you, Hawley.

25:11.549 --> 25:13.283
Not at all.

25:13.284 --> 25:15.986
I'm just cleaning up
my latest acquisition.

25:15.987 --> 25:17.888
The Serpent's Tears.

25:17.889 --> 25:19.823
Only six of these guys known to exist.

25:19.824 --> 25:21.224
Pure silver dipped in

25:21.225 --> 25:23.760
holy water blessed by the Archdiocese

25:23.761 --> 25:25.752
of Halifax on All Saints' Day.

25:25.753 --> 25:27.098
It's like I told you at the library...

25:27.099 --> 25:30.467
forewarned is forearmed.

25:30.468 --> 25:34.704
You also said that if we had a
problem, you would help us.

25:34.705 --> 25:37.474
I did. Because I owed you one, but

25:37.475 --> 25:38.975
then I saved your life.

25:38.976 --> 25:40.744
Pleasant as it was,

25:40.745 --> 25:42.512
my math says it makes us even.

25:42.513 --> 25:43.880
Look, Hawley,

25:43.881 --> 25:45.982
this isn't about your
personal code of commerce.

25:45.983 --> 25:47.784
It's a matter of life and death.

25:47.785 --> 25:51.121
- Well, when isn't it with you two?
- Enough posturing and preening.

25:51.122 --> 25:53.890
- We require a weapon.
- Well, I require you

25:53.891 --> 25:55.292
to step the hell out
of my personal space.

25:55.293 --> 25:58.461
Boys, we don't have time for this.

25:58.462 --> 26:01.798
Mr. Hawley.

26:01.799 --> 26:03.934
My wife is in

26:03.935 --> 26:07.304
imminent and, we
believe, mortal danger.

26:07.305 --> 26:09.039
We need a weapon

26:09.040 --> 26:11.174
to stop the creature that pursues her.

26:11.175 --> 26:13.777
Exactly what are you dealing with here?

26:13.778 --> 26:15.545
A restless spirit.

26:15.546 --> 26:18.782
Shrugs off bullets, pulls you
through some kind of portal

26:18.783 --> 26:19.883
and tries to drown you.

26:19.884 --> 26:23.286
Right, yeah, I... saw that part.

26:23.287 --> 26:25.055
No bullets.

26:25.056 --> 26:28.558
Think I might have just the thing.

26:28.559 --> 26:30.527
(locks clicking)

26:30.528 --> 26:32.695
Oh, yeah.

26:34.932 --> 26:36.233
Ain't she a beaut?

26:36.234 --> 26:39.669
Bought her off a folk
teller in Belgrade.

26:39.670 --> 26:43.340
Claimed a real life Van Helsing
was the original owner of that.

26:43.341 --> 26:45.041
It's cool, huh?

26:45.042 --> 26:47.310
But the real kicker's the bolt.

26:47.311 --> 26:49.312
Solid iron.

26:49.313 --> 26:51.248
Druidic runes along the shaft.

26:51.249 --> 26:55.585
And a reservoir tip filled with
Greek fire and basilisk venom.

26:55.586 --> 26:57.721
How many arms and legs
is this gonna cost us?

26:57.722 --> 27:01.391
Nada. Just finding out if it
works against the sea hag...

27:01.392 --> 27:04.327
well, that's worth more
than the price of lending it.

27:05.329 --> 27:09.566
And if blows up in your face,
you didn't get it from me.

27:11.902 --> 27:13.870
Happy hunting.

27:16.874 --> 27:20.243
(caws)

27:21.879 --> 27:25.081
(muffled shrieking)

27:25.816 --> 27:27.417
Careful with that thing.

27:27.418 --> 27:29.586
We're only gonna get one shot with it.

27:29.587 --> 27:31.187
Then I shall not miss.

27:31.188 --> 27:34.357
Can't risk getting much closer
with the Horseman inside.

27:34.358 --> 27:36.593
But if Mary does come for Katrina,

27:36.594 --> 27:37.894
we might have no choice.

27:37.895 --> 27:40.730
(thunder crashes, horse whinnies)

27:45.436 --> 27:47.103
He's off in a hurry.

27:47.104 --> 27:51.207
If the Horseman's left
this place unguarded...

27:52.576 --> 27:54.777
Katrina.

27:58.683 --> 28:00.483
Katrina?!

28:01.352 --> 28:03.653
Oh, no.

28:09.427 --> 28:12.162
This is the letter Katrina sent me.

28:12.163 --> 28:14.831
The very one I lost at the library.

28:14.832 --> 28:17.467
Then we're right. It's the Weeping Lady.

28:17.468 --> 28:22.072
Mary... Mary's come for her.

28:22.073 --> 28:24.641
We're too late.

28:24.642 --> 28:27.310
No. Crane, the river...

28:27.311 --> 28:29.145
when she pulled me under at the library,

28:29.146 --> 28:31.047
I saw the Dobbs Ferry
Bridge above me. Same place

28:31.048 --> 28:32.749
Caroline's body was found.
We get there in time...

28:32.750 --> 28:35.018
We might still have a chance.

28:35.019 --> 28:37.453
(muffled screaming)

28:43.616 --> 28:46.718
(muffled grunting, screaming)

29:07.273 --> 29:09.774
(muffled screaming)

29:14.947 --> 29:17.915
(gasping)

29:29.683 --> 29:32.084
Katrina! Oh...

29:32.085 --> 29:34.220
Oh.

29:34.221 --> 29:35.955
I feared the worst.

29:35.956 --> 29:39.392
I was only able to escape her
by the skin of my teeth.

29:39.393 --> 29:40.660
What does it want?

29:40.661 --> 29:42.328
(Weeping Lady screaming in distance)

29:42.329 --> 29:44.864
Her name is Mary Wells.

29:44.865 --> 29:46.933
You met her in my company many years ago.

29:46.934 --> 29:48.434
The young woman from England?

29:48.435 --> 29:50.036
The very same.

29:50.037 --> 29:54.840
This creature is her
tormented spirit given flesh.

29:54.841 --> 29:56.943
I do not know what has
brought her here,

29:56.944 --> 29:59.312
but I must learn the truth.

29:59.313 --> 30:00.780
She was raised by dark magic.

30:00.781 --> 30:04.450
I only know one warlock powerful
enough to accomplish it.

30:05.118 --> 30:06.485
Henry.

30:06.486 --> 30:08.254
KATRINA: I can undo his work.

30:08.255 --> 30:11.290
Send that poor woman's
soul to a better place.

30:11.291 --> 30:15.461
But I too must use dark magic
to accomplish the task.

30:15.462 --> 30:18.130
In order to release her
spirit, I must risk my own.

30:18.131 --> 30:20.733
The only way for the spell to be
achieved is for another witch

30:20.734 --> 30:22.435
to serve as an anchor to keep me

30:22.436 --> 30:23.803
from losing my way.

30:23.804 --> 30:26.238
We're all out of witches.
How about a Witness?

30:26.239 --> 30:27.473
(Weeping Lady screaming)

30:27.474 --> 30:30.176
The spell will take some time to cast.

30:30.177 --> 30:31.711
Then I'll hold her off

30:31.712 --> 30:34.079
until the incantation
has taken full effect.

30:35.315 --> 30:37.216
CRANE: Be careful!

30:37.217 --> 30:40.052
I will teach you the
words you must repeat.

30:41.143 --> 30:42.832
_

30:42.937 --> 30:44.839
_

30:49.463 --> 30:51.597
Mary?

30:51.598 --> 30:54.667
Are you here?

30:54.668 --> 30:56.602
It's me.

30:56.603 --> 30:58.337
Ichabod.

30:58.338 --> 31:01.073
(weeping)

31:04.770 --> 31:06.456
_

31:06.504 --> 31:08.260
_

31:08.845 --> 31:10.994
_

31:14.588 --> 31:16.622
Please don't make me use this.

31:16.623 --> 31:19.124
(weeping softly)

31:21.294 --> 31:22.695
My God, Mary.

31:22.696 --> 31:27.199
The torment of the damned
could not be worse.

31:29.336 --> 31:32.638
I didn't mean to disappoint you.

31:33.440 --> 31:36.308
But your anger...

31:36.309 --> 31:38.544
your jealousy...

31:38.545 --> 31:40.246
(screaming)

31:41.381 --> 31:43.916
We're here to help you, Mary.

31:43.917 --> 31:46.152
To free you from this torment.

31:46.153 --> 31:47.420
(screaming)

31:47.421 --> 31:48.988
Mary!

31:50.323 --> 31:52.391
Oh...

31:52.392 --> 31:54.994
(gasping)

31:56.363 --> 31:58.230
(screaming)

32:04.571 --> 32:06.705
Katrina.

32:06.706 --> 32:08.707
Abbie.

32:09.100 --> 32:10.502
_

32:10.503 --> 32:12.061
_

32:12.114 --> 32:13.601
_

32:13.938 --> 32:15.870
_

32:17.250 --> 32:19.451
(groaning)

32:24.658 --> 32:26.625
CRANE: Mary?!

32:27.394 --> 32:29.929
KATRINA: It's done.

32:29.930 --> 32:32.231
As the enchantment takes
hold, Mary's spirit will be

32:32.232 --> 32:34.400
free to leave this earthly plane.

32:35.969 --> 32:38.504
Crane, be careful... she
could still be dangerous.

32:38.505 --> 32:41.440
Not to me.

32:43.443 --> 32:45.644
She will not harm me.

32:54.154 --> 32:56.155
Mary.

32:57.824 --> 33:00.626
You wrote me a letter.

33:00.627 --> 33:02.928
You said you were going home.

33:02.929 --> 33:06.465
Why are you still here?

33:06.466 --> 33:08.300
Mary, what happened to you?

33:16.610 --> 33:18.644
(eerie whoosh)

33:18.645 --> 33:19.812
I don't understand.

33:19.813 --> 33:22.214
Why did she point at you?

33:23.049 --> 33:26.118
She's hated me from the start.

33:26.119 --> 33:28.888
You said yourself she
was a jealous woman.

33:28.889 --> 33:31.790
And never one to give up on anything.

33:31.791 --> 33:35.728
But she went back to England without me.

33:36.630 --> 33:40.432
This doesn't make sense.

33:42.102 --> 33:44.136
There's something you're not telling me.

33:44.137 --> 33:47.439
Ichabod, this is not
the time nor the place.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.108
You're hiding something.

33:49.109 --> 33:52.711
You know why Mary's
spirit haunted this place.

33:53.914 --> 33:55.681
You know what happened to her.

33:55.682 --> 33:57.983
And I will tell you all another day.

33:57.984 --> 34:01.353
I will not leave until
I hear the truth...

34:01.354 --> 34:03.789
from your lips.

34:05.058 --> 34:07.493
What in God's name did you do?

34:10.076 --> 34:12.402
Mary Wells wrote me a letter...

34:12.639 --> 34:14.219
the first day that we met.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.676
She insisted we meet
somewhere privately

34:16.677 --> 34:18.143
to discuss something

34:18.143 --> 34:22.614
concerning my relationship
with... Ichabod Crane.

34:22.616 --> 34:24.217
Miss Wells?

34:24.217 --> 34:25.652
Mary?

34:25.652 --> 34:27.454
MARY: I'm here.

34:27.455 --> 34:28.688
I got your message.

34:28.688 --> 34:30.056
Are you all right?

34:30.056 --> 34:32.058
How have you tempted my love?

34:32.059 --> 34:34.127
I'm-I'm so sorry, I don't understand.

34:34.128 --> 34:36.396
(crying): Ichabod is not
the same man he was.

34:36.397 --> 34:39.466
It's you who have turned his
heart against his country,

34:39.467 --> 34:41.768
against his family... it's you
who have turned him against me!

34:41.768 --> 34:43.036
I can assure you, Ichabod Crane...

34:43.036 --> 34:44.536
Do you deny seducing him?

34:44.538 --> 34:46.406
Deny bewitching him?

34:46.407 --> 34:48.875
I-I am engaged to one
of his best friends...

34:48.876 --> 34:51.578
Lies! You are manipulating,

34:51.579 --> 34:53.947
- and you're using him and changing him!
- Mary, please...

34:53.947 --> 34:55.715
- You are a wicked harlot!
- You have to calm...

34:55.716 --> 34:58.218
- And I won't have you taking him away...
- You have to calm down!

34:58.219 --> 34:59.352
(screams)

34:59.353 --> 35:00.453
Mary?!

35:00.454 --> 35:02.388
<i>She tripped on a root and she fell,</i>

35:02.389 --> 35:06.092
and she must have hit her head
on the way down, because...

35:06.093 --> 35:08.661
Then she was just gone.

35:08.662 --> 35:11.197
(panting)

35:16.704 --> 35:19.305
No, Mary, no.

35:23.777 --> 35:25.712
She never left.

35:25.713 --> 35:27.540
She died here.

35:27.541 --> 35:29.308
It was an accident.

35:30.177 --> 35:32.312
A tragedy that cost her life.

35:32.313 --> 35:34.180
And the letter?

35:34.181 --> 35:36.916
You wrote it, didn't you?

35:36.917 --> 35:41.087
A simple enough enchantment
to match her handwriting.

35:41.088 --> 35:43.590
Why? Katrina...

35:43.591 --> 35:45.558
why did you keep this from me?

35:45.559 --> 35:47.260
Because I cared for you, Ichabod.

35:47.261 --> 35:51.339
You would have carried the
blame, the weight of it all.

35:51.340 --> 35:52.798
No doubt you would have gone home

35:52.799 --> 35:55.068
to bury her, explain
it all to her family.

35:55.069 --> 35:57.937
Who knows if and when
you would have returned

35:57.938 --> 36:02.876
to your role as a Witness
in this war against evil?

36:02.877 --> 36:06.679
Your mission... is far
too important, my love.

36:06.680 --> 36:09.115
You are my wife...

36:09.116 --> 36:11.651
my wife, Katrina...

36:11.652 --> 36:14.821
yet there is so much
that you've kept from me.

36:14.822 --> 36:16.489
You were a spy for Washington.

36:16.490 --> 36:18.324
You're a witch.

36:18.325 --> 36:20.493
You were pregnant with our son Henry.

36:20.494 --> 36:23.096
And now this.

36:25.065 --> 36:27.300
(horse neighs)
Crane!

36:33.707 --> 36:35.708
(shouts incantation)

36:36.510 --> 36:37.944
(panting)

36:37.945 --> 36:41.356
Abraham... it was an angry
spirit from our past

36:41.357 --> 36:43.082
that stole me from your home.

36:43.083 --> 36:45.852
Not Ichabod.

36:46.587 --> 36:49.555
He saved me just now.

36:49.556 --> 36:52.125
Now, I know you might hate him,

36:52.126 --> 36:53.493
but if you care for me,

36:53.494 --> 36:56.529
truly care for me,
like you say you do...

36:57.965 --> 37:00.633
...you will repay him with his life.

37:00.634 --> 37:02.235
(thunder rumbling)

37:07.608 --> 37:10.243
I am ready to go home.

37:23.657 --> 37:26.159
(thunder rumbling)

37:26.160 --> 37:28.027
(horse neighs)

37:28.862 --> 37:30.830
JENNY: Nice digs, Hawley.

37:30.831 --> 37:32.532
Never figured you for a boat person.

37:32.533 --> 37:35.468
Hey, any port in a storm, right?

37:35.469 --> 37:38.231
I don't think that's how that
phrase is supposed to be used.

37:38.232 --> 37:40.239
I meant it literally, not figuratively.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.975
What's up, Mills?

37:41.976 --> 37:43.910
You didn't just come
by here to commandeer

37:43.911 --> 37:45.078
my egg sandwich, did you?

37:45.079 --> 37:47.013
No. Your crossbow is on the boat.

37:47.014 --> 37:49.749
My sister asked me to say thanks.

37:49.750 --> 37:51.317
Did it work?

37:51.318 --> 37:52.885
It's a dud.

37:52.886 --> 37:54.620
She didn't want to tell me herself?

37:54.621 --> 37:56.556
Well, I volunteered to come by.

37:56.557 --> 37:58.658
Said it was on the way
to where I was headed.

37:58.659 --> 38:02.028
And where are you off
to on this... fine day?

38:02.029 --> 38:03.896
Here.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.302
See, I thought we decided we
weren't gonna do that anymore.

38:09.303 --> 38:11.871
- Yeah, well, that was then.
- You don't think we should maybe

38:11.872 --> 38:13.306
keep this professional?

38:13.307 --> 38:15.408
Professional?

38:15.409 --> 38:17.610
Nick Hawley...

38:17.611 --> 38:19.579
are you seeing someone?

38:19.580 --> 38:23.816
No. It's just, you know, there's
a lot going on right now.

38:23.817 --> 38:25.885
Monsters and creatures and...

38:25.886 --> 38:28.955
Armageddon... it's just,
you know, it's a weird time.

38:29.723 --> 38:32.125
Sure. Yeah, I get it.

38:32.126 --> 38:33.626
No harm, no foul.

38:33.627 --> 38:36.095
- It's good seeing you.
- Mm.

38:48.142 --> 38:49.375
See ya.

38:49.376 --> 38:50.710
(laughs)

38:50.711 --> 38:53.546
Oh, come on, Mills.

38:53.547 --> 38:54.947
That is not fair.

38:54.948 --> 38:56.783
You're the pro, Hawley.

38:56.784 --> 38:58.651
(sighs)

38:58.652 --> 39:00.720
Uh...

39:01.555 --> 39:03.189
(sighs)

39:03.190 --> 39:07.226
CRANE: Miss Caroline was
not meant for this time,

39:07.227 --> 39:08.895
but a richer,

39:08.896 --> 39:11.497
truer moment in history.

39:16.570 --> 39:18.771
Thank you.

39:18.772 --> 39:20.640
Until next Saturday.

39:20.641 --> 39:23.242
Battle of Saratoga.

39:30.017 --> 39:33.086
Thank you for your assistance
in setting up this gathering.

39:33.087 --> 39:35.154
I know you cared for her.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.957
Very much.

39:40.127 --> 39:42.128
What pains me the most...

39:42.129 --> 39:43.629
is that it was my friendship

39:43.630 --> 39:46.666
that brought her to this tragic end.

39:47.501 --> 39:49.969
Our mission as Witnesses

39:49.970 --> 39:53.573
puts those for whom we care
the most in terrible danger.

39:53.574 --> 39:57.043
Well, if we don't do this job,
those same people will die

39:57.044 --> 39:59.679
in Moloch's Apocalypse.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.815
Our duty... must be to one another,

40:02.816 --> 40:04.750
before anything.

40:04.751 --> 40:06.393
Or anyone.

40:06.394 --> 40:09.422
This is another Katrina thing, isn't it?

40:11.358 --> 40:14.060
Marriage is difficult on the best day.

40:14.061 --> 40:17.063
But without trust...

40:17.064 --> 40:20.132
without honesty...

40:21.401 --> 40:26.172
...how can a union between
two people hope to survive?

40:45.159 --> 40:48.628
You and Henry must be pleased.

40:48.629 --> 40:50.963
Your plan had the intended effect.

40:50.964 --> 40:53.265
I made no plan with Henry.

40:55.469 --> 40:57.403
That woman, Mary...

40:57.404 --> 41:00.606
I assumed you and he
called her from the depths

41:00.607 --> 41:02.608
to shake Ichabod's faith in me.

41:02.609 --> 41:05.511
I had no part in that.

41:05.512 --> 41:07.246
I went to the river

41:07.247 --> 41:09.682
because I feared for <i>your</i> safety.

41:15.489 --> 41:17.523
I'm never happy

41:17.524 --> 41:21.394
to see you unhappy, Katrina.

41:22.596 --> 41:24.630
Abraham?

41:29.603 --> 41:32.037
Thank you.

41:40.881 --> 41:43.282
(growling)

41:43.283 --> 41:45.084

_

41:54.458 --> 41:55.920
_

41:57.264 --> 42:01.000
The Weeping Lady wasn't
meant to harm her.

42:01.001 --> 42:03.636
It wasn't part of your plan, but...

42:03.637 --> 42:05.715
I was trying to please you.

42:05.716 --> 42:07.102
