for nearly an hour.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.537
W-Whatever that is,
it's gotta wait.

10:16.610 --> 10:18.100
I finally got a good hold
on the little rascal.

10:18.180 --> 10:19.442
Are you listening?
Ah, damn it.

10:19.510 --> 10:20.841
Baldomero's gonna
kill you.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.649
Said he wants to finish
what he started,

10:22.720 --> 10:24.017
get even
for Iztapalapa.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.887
He's still _stuck on that?
He's telling everyone.

10:25.950 --> 10:28.680
Says he and his dogs
are gonna jump you
during yard time.

10:28.760 --> 10:29.784
Day after tomorrow.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.225
Day after?

10:31.290 --> 10:32.894
What's wrong
with tomorrow?

10:32.960 --> 10:34.393
Man's got woodshop.

10:34.460 --> 10:35.825
(LAUGHING)
Oh, come on.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.061
It's like high-school
fisticuffs.

10:38.130 --> 10:41.031
Are you hearing me?
This is serious, man.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.863
It's no time to mess around
With bed sheets, all rIght?

10:42.940 --> 10:45.465
We got to get you a weapon,
give you a Chance.

10:45.540 --> 10:47.030
Maybe you could
find me a pen.

10:47.110 --> 10:48.805
Yeah, there you go.
That's good.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.701
Make a shiv.
I'm gonna find you a pen.

10:51.780 --> 10:54.442
Vontae,
one other thing.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.748
I wonder
if you'd be willing

10:55.820 --> 10:58.141
to find out
who's playing that music.

10:58.220 --> 11:01.018
I hear music,
and I'm certain
that's a record.

11:01.090 --> 11:03.422
If someone has a phonograph
on the block,

11:03.490 --> 11:07.096
I would love to borrow,
rent, or buy it.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.855
(SIGHS)

11:08.930 --> 11:10.522
Okay.

11:12.270 --> 11:14.238
COOPER: Sophia Quayle,
Agents Ressler and Navabi.

11:14.300 --> 11:18.532
Miss Quayle directs
Cryptologic Exploitation
Services for the NSA.

11:18.610 --> 11:19.975
So you're a code breaker.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.507
Is that what
Hardekopf pawned,
one of our codes?

11:21.580 --> 11:24.344
Hardekopf was working
on developing
a decryption algorithm,

11:24.410 --> 11:26.605
one that we believe
may now be operational.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.568
An algorithm to decrypt
what exactly?

11:28.650 --> 11:31.414
In recent years, there's been
an unprecedented number

11:31.490 --> 11:33.617
of breaches
by Chinese intelligence.

11:33.690 --> 11:35.214
We'd hoped that the cypher
would allow us

11:35.290 --> 11:37.588
to decrypt Chinese
diplomatic cables

11:37.660 --> 11:40.220
sent to Beijing
from their embassy in DC.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.360
Accessing that would
help us to identify
the source of the leak.

11:43.430 --> 11:46.558
And the names of any Americans
who may have been turned
by the Chinese.

11:46.630 --> 11:48.791
As well as what intel
the traitors provided.

11:48.870 --> 11:51.407
This is a once-in-a-decade
breakthrough,

11:51.470 --> 11:53.472
and now you're telling me
that it's in the hands

11:53.540 --> 11:55.633
of, what,
some pawnbroker?

11:55.710 --> 11:57.803
Our source says
that there is honor

11:57.880 --> 11:59.108
among these
particular thieves.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.738
Clients are
given 30 days

12:00.820 --> 12:02.572
to reclaim the items
they've brought
to the brokers.

12:02.650 --> 12:04.083
After that,
they're put up for sale.

12:04.150 --> 12:05.708
For the moment,
the codes are safe.

12:05.790 --> 12:07.314
All in.

12:07.390 --> 12:09.881
QUAYLE: We've spent four years
working to break this code.

12:09.960 --> 12:13.088
If word of this leaks out,
the Chinese will change
their encryption,

12:13.160 --> 12:14.821
and we'll be back
at square one.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.993
So, is there any idea
why Hardekopf did it?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.698
I don't know or care.
We went through his desk.

12:19.770 --> 12:22.398
A hard drive is missing.
You need to get it back.

12:42.590 --> 12:44.251
BUCK: I'm sorry.
I-I tried everything.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.025
JENNIFER: But you're supposed
to be this genius.

12:46.090 --> 12:48.490
BUCK: The information
on the drive
wasn't just deleted.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.869
It was erased from
the unallocated portions of...

12:50.930 --> 12:52.693
Well, then reallocate it,
undelete it.

12:52.770 --> 12:55.762
I think what my sister
is trying to say is
thank you for trying.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.467
I'm really very sorry.
I think you should go.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.462
Does this mean I'm not invited
to the Beyonce concert?

12:59.540 --> 13:00.529
Go.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.381
There has to be a way
to connect one of them
to Reddington.

13:12.450 --> 13:14.554
It's done.
Somebody from the OR,

13:14.620 --> 13:16.156
somebody who was there
when he went.

13:16.220 --> 13:17.778

He won.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.362
(SIGHING) How can
you accept that?

13:23.430 --> 13:24.567
I don't.

13:26.570 --> 13:28.959
But I'm not gonna let it
or him control my life.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.974
Besides, it wasn't
all for nothing.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.574
If it weren't
for Reddington's secret,

13:38.650 --> 13:40.345
we wouldn't
have each other.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.989
It's not enough.

13:46.190 --> 13:47.953
(INHALES DEEPLY)

13:50.230 --> 13:51.879
I think it has to be.

Hey. I found it.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.429
Yo, this wasn't easy.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.102
I had to bribe
the librarian,

14:06.170 --> 14:08.229
said I was homesick
and needed to drop
my mom a note.

14:08.310 --> 14:09.709
You know how that
makes me look, right?

14:09.780 --> 14:11.099
Like a good son.

14:12.580 --> 14:13.877
Be proud.
You want to tell me

14:13.950 --> 14:15.542
what's up with you
and this string thing?

14:15.620 --> 14:16.882
Did you bring
the meat?

14:16.950 --> 14:18.417

14:19.620 --> 14:21.759

to get you a weapon,

14:23.760 --> 14:25.489
and you're playing
with string
like a kitty cat.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.757
I found myself with something
of a rodent situation.

14:28.830 --> 14:31.094
Baldomero's gonna plant you
in the ground, okay,

14:31.170 --> 14:33.365
and if he kills you,
he'll certainly kill me.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.534
Vontae, might I offer you
a bit of unsolicited advice?

14:36.600 --> 14:37.965
No.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.735

14:46.110 --> 14:51.116
what you can do is help me
tie more of this string.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.323
Of course.
It's yours.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.119
All we need
IS the loan
plus Interest.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.861
I don't have it.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.160
Tell us about your
precautions to get here.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.798
Did you switch cars
as instructed?

15:12.870 --> 15:14.804
I had a debt
from gambling.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.440
I had a way out,
but it didn't work
the way I thought, and...

15:17.510 --> 15:19.774
You mean you pawned
classified intel

15:19.850 --> 15:21.442
to try to win back
a gambling debt?

15:21.520 --> 15:24.182
I need the drive.
You can't just have it.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.389
The intel I gave you
can never come out.

15:26.450 --> 15:27.917
It would be like
committing treason.

15:27.990 --> 15:30.686
Well, you've got 30 days
to make sure
that doesn't happen.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.182
I lost the money!

15:32.260 --> 15:34.820
I was one card away,
and I lost everything.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.027
Just give me the drive,
and I'll find a way to pay.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.829
I'll figure it out.
Tell me about the cars.

15:38.900 --> 15:40.765
Why do you keep asking
about the damn cars?

15:40.840 --> 15:43.866
In our experience,
clients in your situation

15:43.940 --> 15:46.158
tend to draw attention
to themselves,

15:46.240 --> 15:48.174
the kind of attention
we can't afford.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.300
I wasn't followed, okay?
We're alone.

15:51.380 --> 15:54.042
Which means we're gonna come
to a new understanding.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.513
_ Yes.
I believe we are.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.285

Forensics?

None, and if there were
any forensics,

16:15.700 --> 16:17.565
the liquid hydrogen
burned them away.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.232
Well, we had a team
on the Pawnbrokers.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.505
They lost them.
Now we know why.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.070
As long as Hardekopf
was alive,

16:23.150 --> 16:25.539
we had 30 days until our intel
hit the open market.

they're free to sell

already have one.

65-inch with,

20:01.530 --> 20:03.623

a built-in camera

20:03.700 --> 20:05.292
to video-chat with friends
Via Wi-Fi.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.689
Which we hacked into.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.795
You have eyes on the store?
Well, there's no audio,

20:08.870 --> 20:11.430
but 10 minutes ago,
we saw this.

20:11.510 --> 20:12.704
SAMAR: We_cross—checked
his image

20:12.770 --> 20:14.408
with the Bureau's database
on foreign agents.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.038
His name is Niu Quaing.

20:16.110 --> 20:18.977
He's a member of the Chinese
intelligence service MSS.

20:19.050 --> 20:21.041
If the Chinese know
what's on that drive,

20:21.120 --> 20:22.974
then they know the NSA
hacked their codes.

20:23.050 --> 20:24.381
They'll change them.

20:24.450 --> 20:26.748
And years of work will
be for nothing.

20:26.820 --> 20:28.412
But the Chinese
don't already know.

20:28.490 --> 20:29.980
The Pawnbrokers would
never tell them,

20:30.060 --> 20:32.119
and if they did, the Chinese
would just Change the codes

20:32.190 --> 20:33.623
and the drive
would be worthless,

20:33.700 --> 20:36.498
which is the last thing
that the Pawnbrokers want.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.118
Now, if they're good
at their job,

20:38.200 --> 20:40.293
they'll tease them,
bid the price up.

20:40.370 --> 20:42.793
But until the Chinese
actually buy that drive,

20:42.870 --> 20:44.735
they won't know exactly
what they have.

20:44.810 --> 20:48.109
Meaning,
we have to buy it first.
QUAYLE: I'm sorry.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.603
You're expecting them
to sell us back our own intel?

20:50.680 --> 20:52.841
Not us. Mossad.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.344
VONTAE: You know, I risked
my neck getting you a pen,

20:57.420 --> 20:59.911
and instead of making a shank,
you're writing a letter.

20:59.990 --> 21:04.154
Vontae,
any chance you've heard
of William Floyd Collins?

21:04.890 --> 21:06.255
Collins?

21:06.330 --> 21:07.524
No.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.454
What's he in for?
He's not an inmate.

21:09.530 --> 21:12.169
He was a cave explorer
in Kentucky

21:12.230 --> 21:14.596
around the turn
of the last century.

21:14.670 --> 21:17.867
He explored Kentuclq because
of the hundreds of miles

21:17.940 --> 21:21.603
of interconnected
underground caverns.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.841
But in the winter
of 1925,

21:23.910 --> 21:26.799
while trying to find
a new entrance
to Crystal Cave,

21:26.880 --> 21:30.441
Collins became trapped
in a narrow crawlway

21:30.520 --> 21:32.886
55 feet below ground.

21:32.950 --> 21:36.488
But it's rumored that,
in order to find an escape,

21:36.560 --> 21:39.120
Collins lit a candle,
held it up,

21:39.190 --> 21:42.694
and let the smoke draft
p0int him toward an eXIt.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.022
Here. Hand me the rat.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.965

that's a cute story,

21:46.030 --> 21:47.793
but this ain't no cave,

21:47.870 --> 21:49.360
so what's it got to do
with me and you

21:49.440 --> 21:50.839

in the yard?

21:50.910 --> 21:54.004
REDDINGTON:
If this little fella
found his way in,

21:54.080 --> 21:56.776
I bet he can find
his way back out,

21:56.840 --> 21:58.398
like a draft of smoke

21:58.480 --> 22:00.539
or a carrier pigeon.

22:01.250 --> 22:03.013
Some note on a rat?

22:03.080 --> 22:04.479
A-are you insane?

22:04.550 --> 22:07.087
Ain't no message-in-a-bottle
nonsense gonna work.

22:07.150 --> 22:10.722
Well, either way,
we'll likely be
dead by Friday.

VONTAE: So long.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.892
Bring us some luck,
William Floyd Collins.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.565
(CHUCKLES) Collins actually
died in the cave.

22:19.630 --> 22:24.238

by exposure, hypothermia

22:47.260 --> 22:48.591

were clear.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.298

to purchase that drive

22:50.360 --> 22:51.520
and to bring it to me
directly.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.067
And the Mossad?
It's a Closed loop.

22:53.130 --> 22:55.030

about this operation

22:55.100 --> 22:56.567

I'd like to buy,

23:04.380 --> 23:07.770

classified data for the NSA.

23:07.850 --> 23:10.648
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.938
Well, that's funny,
because a few hours ago,

23:13.020 --> 23:16.478
you agreed to sell it
to a member
of the Chinese MSS.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.879
