00:16.200 --> 00:20.960
We're gonna make it to the gate,
but we're under fire. Teal'c's taken a hit.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.600
What's your situation?

00:38.520 --> 00:41.000
Tyler's hit and we're cut off,
so get outta here.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.840
- We can hold the gate.
- Negative.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.440
- We're not leaving without you.
- Carter, don't argue with me.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.920
Get reinforcements.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.320
Sir. Receiving IDC. It's SG-1 .

00:57.440 --> 00:59.400
Open the iris.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.320
Close the iris!

01:10.400 --> 01:12.760
- Report.
- We were attacked by several Jaffa.

01:12.880 --> 01:16.360
Lieutenant Tyler went down
and Colonel O'Neill went back for him.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.920
Let's assemble a rescue team and return.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.000
Hold on. Who's Lieutenant Tyler?

01:22.080 --> 01:25.120
- He's a member of SG-1 .
- What?

01:25.200 --> 01:28.400
You assigned him yourself last month, sir.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.040
Tyler, sir. We've been training him
for weeks. This was his third mission.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.480
Major, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.200
We gotta move, Lieutenant.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.280
- Can you walk?
- I can try.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.760
Let's go.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.680
We must return to the planet.

03:05.800 --> 03:09.000
No one's going anywhere until
I find out exactly what happened.

03:09.080 --> 03:12.960
O'Neill and Lieutenant Tyler were cut off
from the gate. I already told you.

03:13.040 --> 03:17.480
- I've never heard of this Lieutenant Tyler.
- How can you say that?

03:17.560 --> 03:20.800
- Report to the infirmary.
- There is nothing wrong with us.

03:20.920 --> 03:24.800
- We'll leave that up to Dr Fraiser.
- General, Jack is trapped on that planet.

03:24.880 --> 03:28.520
Sergeant. Escort them to the infirmary.

03:28.640 --> 03:31.280
With or without reinforcements,
we are going back.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.960
The hell you are!
Relinquish your weapons.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.880
Airmen.

03:39.320 --> 03:44.760
Major, I will authorise the use of force
unless you relinquish those weapons.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.240
- You are heavier than you look.
- Sorry, sir.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.279
That's no problem.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.640
How's the leg?

04:33.520 --> 04:35.480
It's no problem.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.440
Yeah, right.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.400
What is this place?

05:03.520 --> 05:07.560
Well, I wouldn't buy a time-share,
but it's defendable.

05:08.520 --> 05:12.960
- Until Major Carter returns?
- Yeah, and a whole lot of her friends.

05:16.240 --> 05:19.600
Colonel... you could have
made it to the gate.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.960
You came back for me.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.120
- What's your point?
- I guess I'm grateful.

05:27.920 --> 05:33.120
I wasn't gonna let you die, Lieutenant.
It's, like, a ton of paperwork.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.160
Paperwork?

05:37.360 --> 05:39.680
It's a joke.

05:40.480 --> 05:44.440
My way of deflecting attention
from my own obvious heroism.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.440
- You'll get used to it.
- Oh, right. I understand.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.200
Right.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.040
(Fraiser) General Hammond.

06:00.120 --> 06:05.080
Teal'c is going to be fine. It's a bad burn,
but his symbiote should take care of it.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.320
Any word from Colonel O'Neill?

06:10.400 --> 06:13.040
We've been trying to raise him
using the MALP as a relay,

06:13.160 --> 06:15.480
but apparently it's been disabled.

06:15.600 --> 06:19.240
I've completed my preliminary exams
of Major Carter, Teal'c and Daniel.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.320
So far I've found nothing wrong.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.400
They're obviously agitated,
but that's understandable.

06:24.480 --> 06:28.600
They have come back talking about
a lieutenant who doesn't exist.

06:28.720 --> 06:32.440
- You can't tell me there's nothing wrong.
- I can't explain it, sir.

06:32.560 --> 06:37.120
- Some kind of hallucination?
- Hallucinations aren't normally shared.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.120
There's never been a Tyler here.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.440
Yes, sir, and we're still
waiting for test results.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.760
I want them quarantined in the infirmary.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.360
Already done that, sir, as a precaution.

06:49.480 --> 06:53.840
But they did insist I ask what
you're gonna do about Colonel O'Neill.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.880
If SG-1 has fallen under
some kind of an alien influence,

06:58.000 --> 07:02.200
anyone I send back to the planet
would be compromised as well.

07:02.280 --> 07:06.560
Until we know exactly what's going on,
P7S-441 is off limits.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.800
Yes, sir.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.920
This is ridiculous. We should
never have left the damn planet.

07:16.040 --> 07:20.400
- You were ordered to by Colonel O'Neill.
- Who could be dead, for all we know.

07:20.520 --> 07:25.320
There's nothing we can do. There are
heavily armed men just outside that door.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.400
Well, we have to do something.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.640
OK. Let's think this through.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.880
Why would Hammond say he doesn't
remember Lieutenant Tyler?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.240
I don't think he's just saying it.
I think he doesn't remember.

07:36.360 --> 07:40.320
Yesterday we were all in the briefing room
for two hours going over the mission.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.400
I do not believe he would lie to us.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.840
So he's suffering from
some kind of amnesia?

07:44.960 --> 07:47.440
If that's the case,
they're all suffering from it.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.840
Dr Fraiser didn't seem
to remember him either.

07:49.960 --> 07:54.520
Perhaps General Hammond is correct
and there is something wrong with us.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.880
OK. When I went through
the quantum mirror on P3R-233,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.280
I came back to a base
that looked just like this one.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.280
Everything was the same,
except no one knew who I was.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.880
Because the Daniel Jackson
in that reality never joined the SGC.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.640
Right. So, what if this is a reality
where Tyler never joined?

08:12.760 --> 08:15.200
Or maybe he was killed
in an earlier mission.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.720
- Maybe he was never even born.
- I don't know.

08:17.840 --> 08:21.600
There was nothing on 441 that even
remotely resembled a quantum mirror.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.840
Perhaps the Stargate malfunctioned.

08:23.960 --> 08:29.720
We've never had any evidence to suggest
the gate can access a parallel universe.

08:30.080 --> 08:34.039
If Lieutenant Tyler does exist, there
would be a record of him in the computer.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.080
Yes. His personnel file.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.960
My access code isn't working.

08:49.400 --> 08:53.080
They must have decided that
we're a security risk and locked us out.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.760
- So you can't get in.
- I didn't say that.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.920
Where's your weapon, Lieutenant?

09:05.040 --> 09:07.840
I'm sorry, sir. I dropped it when I got hit.

09:09.360 --> 09:14.960
Well, we've still got four mags, two clips,
a little C4, some grenades and a launcher.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.000
Is that enough?

09:19.160 --> 09:20.800
It's a start.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.880
No record of a Lieutenant Tyler
on active duty at the SGC.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.720
- Impossible.
- Even day-pass visitors are logged in.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.280
There is no way he could have been
on the base and not be in the computer.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.840
I configured a search for the name Tyler
anywhere in the database. Nothing.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.440
Obviously someone is wrong here.
Could it be us?

09:40.560 --> 09:46.160
- I think we have to admit the possibility.
- In either case, O'Neill remains in danger.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.480
This is weird. Somebody else configured
an identical search less than an hour ago.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.880
- Somebody outside the base.
- Outside? How do you know that?

09:56.000 --> 10:00.280
Because it's not a base ID.
It's just a user number: 4574.

10:05.600 --> 10:10.560
He's been busy. Over the past two weeks,
he's accessed a number of secure files.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.400
Mission logs, briefings, personnel files.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.160
Whose personnel files?

10:18.360 --> 10:20.320
Ours.

10:45.400 --> 10:50.600
All right, listen up. We got a couple of
MREs left, but we're runnin' low on water.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.960
I'm gonna check the area.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.040
Take the P90.

10:59.080 --> 11:02.760
Wouldn't it be safer just to wait?
The others should be coming soon.

11:02.880 --> 11:06.000
They should have been here by now.
Somethin' musta happened.

11:06.120 --> 11:10.080
- Are you saying they're not coming?
- No. It might take longer than we thought.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.640
- What if they never made it back?
- Hammond'll send someone else.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.120
- How do you know?
- We don't leave our people behind.

11:17.880 --> 11:21.360
- You should know that.
- Yes, sir.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.000
Good.

11:25.320 --> 11:27.280
Stay off the radio.

11:28.720 --> 11:32.520
Keep the channel open. I'll give you
three clicks when I'm on the way back.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.200
- So don't shoot me.
- I won't.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.360
- Sergeant?
- I'm sorry, sir.

11:54.480 --> 11:59.280
The second MALP was struck by zat fire
shortly after reaching the planet.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.440
- Launch the UAV.
- Yes, sir.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.200
Stand clear.

12:07.600 --> 12:11.000
UAV is airborne
and beginning search pattern.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.960
Try to raise Colonel O'Neill.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.800
SG-niner, this is Stargate Command.
Please respond.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.760
SG-niner, this is Stargate Command.
Please respond.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.960
We're still here. Over.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.920
This is General Hammond.
What's yoursituation?

12:43.040 --> 12:47.080
We could use some backup, sir. Tyler's
immobile and there's Jaffa all over...

12:47.160 --> 12:49.120
(interference)

12:51.920 --> 12:55.440
- Sir, we lost the signal.
- He said Tyler.

12:55.560 --> 13:00.920
Obviously he's been affected by the same
hallucination as the rest of SG-1 .

13:01.000 --> 13:04.040
That rules out sending a retrieval team
until we know more.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.360
Well, sir, if you like,
we could try sending a second UAV.

13:07.440 --> 13:10.160
I don't know if that's a good idea, General.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.480
- Those things aren't cheap.
- Colonel Simmons.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.320
- You might wanna take a look at that.
- My office.

13:20.480 --> 13:25.120
Colonel, I understand you've been
ordered to investigate a security problem.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.600
When three of your team voice concerns
about an imaginary friend,

13:28.720 --> 13:30.640
it does tend to raise eyebrows.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.400
Your own report suggests
some sort of mind control.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.480
- I have people working on it.
- I'm sure.

13:35.600 --> 13:40.280
But we think that an independent
investigation is called for.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.120
I'm sure we'll have your full cooperation.

13:46.680 --> 13:50.280
You can use the red phone, but one day
you'll play that card once too often.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.440
I have an officer trapped off world

13:52.560 --> 13:56.120
and there's nothing I can do for him
until I get to the bottom of this.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.280
Well then, sir,
you should welcome my help.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.160
Dr Jackson. Sit down.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.120
Why?

14:21.560 --> 14:25.440
I thought I'd give you an opportunity
to explain what happened on that planet.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.640
I filed a report.

14:27.960 --> 14:32.080
Yes, you did.
And a very interesting read it is.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.960
Full of amazing events
and fictional characters.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.480
Sit down.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.520
Wait a minute. Let me see that.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.600
Dr Fraiser? We got
the blood work and DNA results.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.080
- No anomalies detected.
- Thank you.

15:11.520 --> 15:15.280
I found this residue on Teal'c's jacket.
I want you to have this analysed.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.360
Yes, Doctor.

15:32.080 --> 15:37.360
This is a video tape of your briefing
before the mission to P7S-441 .

15:37.720 --> 15:42.400
I see four members of the SG-1 team,
I see Dr Fraiser, I see General Hammond.

15:42.520 --> 15:46.240
- But I don't see any lieutenants.
- This could be any briefing.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.720
Take a look at the time code.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.960
This is a waste of time.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.400
This is not a waste of time.
This is an official investigation.

15:59.520 --> 16:03.160
No, I mean I get it. We obviously
have Lieutenant Tyler issues.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.640
I mean, I say he exists,
you say he doesn't.

16:05.760 --> 16:10.320
- This is not just about Lieutenant Tyler.
- Someone else doesn't exist?

16:11.920 --> 16:16.120
I'd like you to explain your relationship
with Dr Sarah Gardner.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.080
What does that have to do with this?

16:26.200 --> 16:30.240
Dr Jackson, I am here to investigate

16:30.320 --> 16:33.840
potential alien influences
over Stargate Command.

16:33.960 --> 16:39.160
A Goa'uld taking your ex-girlfriend
as a host has everything to do with this.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.240
What?

16:41.760 --> 16:44.320
- You were very close.
- That's none of your business.

16:44.400 --> 16:48.440
- Your entire life is our business.
- Do I need to call an attorney?

16:49.240 --> 16:52.680
Serious questions have been raised
concerning your viability here.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.000
I am giving you
an opportunity to respond.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.080
OK, respond. Fine.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.040
I lost someone I care about.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.600
And not for the first time, I might add.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.280
You think that makes me
sympathetic to the Goa'uld?

17:05.400 --> 17:08.359
That makes you someone
whose judgment can be easily clouded.

17:08.440 --> 17:11.880
And for a man in your position,
that's unacceptable.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.040
What's your position again?

17:25.599 --> 17:27.560
I need to speak to Major Carter.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.560
Thank you.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.760
- What's going on, Janet?
- I need to ask you something.

17:41.840 --> 17:45.960
This Lieutenant Tyler you keep
talking about, what does he look like?

17:47.440 --> 17:51.800
- African-American, mid-twenties.
- About five ten, five eleven?

17:54.320 --> 17:57.200
I'm not sure, but I think I remember him.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.280
Two hours ago you'd never heard of him.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.840
I know. I can't explain it,
but I can remember his face.

18:02.960 --> 18:06.320
- Does anyone else remember him?
- I don't know.

18:08.880 --> 18:14.240
OK. Maybe something did happen to us,
but you were never even on that planet.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.960
- I have to report this to Hammond.
- Janet, wait.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.520
If you come forward,
they'll start suspecting you as well.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.320
You need to find evidence.
As long as we're locked up,

18:28.440 --> 18:32.800
we can't do anything to help
Colonel O'Neill. It's up to you.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.240
I'd like to speak to General Eastman.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.160
I'd like to know
who this man is working for.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.960
I appreciate that, sir. I needto know.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.680
Mr Secretary,
I wouldn't be making this call

18:59.760 --> 19:02.320
if I didn't consider it
of the utmost importance.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.360
I know he's with the Joint Chiefs.

19:04.480 --> 19:08.280
Do you have any idea
when he might become available?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.360
I see.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.440
All right. Thank you.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.160
Where are you from, Tyler?

19:53.880 --> 19:55.520
Texas.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.600
Mostly. We moved around a lot.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.640
You?

20:02.960 --> 20:05.760
Born in Chicago. Raised in Minnesota.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.240
Is it nice there?

20:11.640 --> 20:13.600
"Is it nice there?"

20:17.000 --> 20:19.880
Do you know what the Goa'uld
really want from us?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.360
Minnesota, that's what.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.520
For the fishing, mostly.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.440
I'll take you sometime.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.000
- Fishing?
- Oh, yeah.

20:30.120 --> 20:32.480
Ask Teal'c. He can't get enough.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.640
When do you think
we'll get outta here, sir?

20:39.720 --> 20:44.640
If not tomorrow, we'll head up into the
hills and wait until the Jaffa lose interest.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.600
They'll never stop hunting us.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.640
What makes you say that?

20:55.680 --> 20:58.480
Isn't... that the way they are?

21:02.960 --> 21:05.320
That may be the way they are.

21:06.680 --> 21:11.040
But... we're the way we are, so...

21:13.360 --> 21:15.320
There you are.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.080
Get some sleep.

21:31.440 --> 21:35.800
Tell me, Teal'c, how does it feel
knowing you betrayed your friends?

21:35.880 --> 21:37.840
I betrayed no one.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.280
You led Apophis into the mothership,

21:41.400 --> 21:45.600
which was occupied by SG-1
and the Tok'ra Selmak.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.400
You could have gotten them all killed.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.440
At the time, I was made to believe that
my time with the Tauri was a subterfuge.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.320
- And now?
- I am loyal to the Tauri.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.880
Why should I believe you?

21:57.000 --> 22:00.200
If I were still loyal to the Goa'uld,
you would know it.

22:00.320 --> 22:06.000
It would be immediately apparent. I would
not hesitate to kill you where you sit.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.240
(aircraft approaching)

22:33.480 --> 22:35.440
Ah, crap!

22:37.320 --> 22:40.200
- What is it?
- Glider. Stay here.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.840
- Nice shot.
- Where in the hell did that come from?

23:20.920 --> 23:25.880
Could be the glider we saw when we were
checking out the crashed troop transport.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.440
Right.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.920
Anyway, it's made our position.
Can you move?

23:33.640 --> 23:35.600
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.640
All right. Time to dig in.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.600
We have a problem here, Major.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.520
You say that this was your third op
with Lieutenant Tyler.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.960
But based on your own report
of SG-1's last mission,

23:54.080 --> 23:56.320
you make absolutely
no mention of his name.

23:56.440 --> 24:00.560
Daniel's name doesn't appear in all of my
reports. It doesn't mean he wasn't there.

24:00.640 --> 24:04.160
Don't you think it's odd that no one
can corroborate your story?

24:04.280 --> 24:08.640
Yes, I do. But what difference does
it make? Colonel O'Neill is still out there.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.680
You want us to send a rescue team,

24:10.800 --> 24:13.120
based on your word
that he's not been compromised?

24:13.240 --> 24:16.480
- We'll go ourselves.
- I can't trust you to do that.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.960
Dr Jackson's motives for being here
are coloured by his emotions,

24:21.080 --> 24:22.720
and always have been.

24:22.800 --> 24:26.320
Teal'c changes sides more often
than I change the oil in my car.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.800
- What about me?
- Well, let's see.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.480
You were briefly taken over
as a host by the Goa'uld.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.720
Once you fell under the control
of an artificial intelligence.

24:37.840 --> 24:41.560
And last time we met, you harboured
an alien in your own home.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.880
I'm beginning to wonder whether all of
this might have some residual effect.

24:45.960 --> 24:51.160
Yesterday you violated base security by
trying to get into one of the mainframes.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.600
I could nail you on that alone.

24:59.880 --> 25:04.920
You're user number 4574, the one
who's been accessing our personnel files.

25:05.360 --> 25:10.000
You don't care about Tyler. You've been
waiting for something to use against us.

25:10.120 --> 25:13.480
Who are you getting
your orders from, Colonel?

25:18.440 --> 25:20.400
This interview is over.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.320
Right, trips are set.

26:14.440 --> 26:18.800
Take the nine mil.
If we get into it, make every shot count.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.760
- I cannot let you do this, Colonel.
- Do what?

26:25.400 --> 26:27.800
I cannot let you die, protecting me.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.760
(Jaffa horn)

26:34.120 --> 26:36.240
What have you got for us, Doctor?

26:36.360 --> 26:40.320
I think I may have figured out
what's been happening to SG-1 .

26:40.640 --> 26:45.400
I found a foreign chemical on Teal'c's
uniform and I've completed my analysis.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.960
- What is it?
- Well, I'm not 100 per cent sure.

26:48.080 --> 26:51.040
But its structure resembles
cortical acetylcholine,

26:51.120 --> 26:54.520
a neurotransmitter that helps
regulate and process human memory.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.840
I believe that Lieutenant Tyler,
or the idea of him,

26:57.960 --> 27:00.840
is nothing more than a chemical implant.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.600
Here, take a look.
You see, the effect is greatest

27:05.680 --> 27:08.560
in the temporal lobe
associated with face recognition.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.840
It's possible that SG-1
encountered someone on the planet

27:11.960 --> 27:14.200
who exposed them to this,
to convince them

27:14.320 --> 27:18.000
that he, she or it
was somehow familiar.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.920
We're not talking about
a vague sense of recognition,

27:21.000 --> 27:24.440
but detailed memories from weeks
before they set foot on that planet.

27:24.560 --> 27:28.600
Their own minds provided the details
necessary to complete that illusion.

27:28.680 --> 27:32.640
Didn't your first report say
that their MRls were clean?

27:32.760 --> 27:36.360
They were. The chemical
dissipates fairly quickly.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.600
So what's that?

27:40.120 --> 27:45.560
That's me. I was exposed. The chemical
passed through a layer of plastic,

27:45.640 --> 27:49.000
which is probably why I experienced
only a diminished effect.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.920
This is how I figured it out.

27:51.040 --> 27:54.840
You were exposed to an alien chemical
and now you claim to have figured it out?

27:54.960 --> 27:59.080
Sir, knowing that the contamination
requires close proximity,

27:59.200 --> 28:03.560
I am confident that SG-1 could return
and avoid further contamination.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.640
We can't trust her.

28:08.160 --> 28:12.120
General, please. This could be
Colonel O'Neill's last hope.

28:25.040 --> 28:28.400
I counted 15. Could get interesting.

28:29.240 --> 28:32.120
Colonel, I'm not what you think I am.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.560
I am not a member of your team.

28:36.680 --> 28:39.720
I never was. I am not even human.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.080
- My race is the Reol.
- Take your position.

28:42.200 --> 28:45.240
I exposed you to a chemical that
made you think I was one of you.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.120
- Get back there.
- You don't believe me.

28:50.440 --> 28:55.640
Look at my leg. It's almost healed.
Would this be possible if I were human?

28:55.760 --> 28:58.880
- Would you get down?
- I'll show you.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.440
Jeez!

29:06.560 --> 29:10.520
- What the hell is that?
- A glimpse of my true nature.

29:12.600 --> 29:15.560
You mean, what you really look like?

29:15.680 --> 29:18.120
It's a natural defence mechanism.

29:18.240 --> 29:22.960
A chemical we produce in our bodies.
That's why I was a prisoner of the Jaffa.

29:23.080 --> 29:25.040
They were taking me to be dissected.

29:25.160 --> 29:29.760
I broke free of my cell and damaged
the guidance system of the transport ship.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.920
We crashed on this planet.
That's when you found me.

29:33.040 --> 29:35.280
I didn't know if you could be trusted.

29:36.040 --> 29:42.080
- You picked a hell of a time to tell me.
- Please... understand, Colonel.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.040
(explosion)

30:20.400 --> 30:22.600
Hit the C4.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.280
Again!

31:01.520 --> 31:02.840
Behind you!

31:21.760 --> 31:23.400
(speaks Jaffa)

31:40.240 --> 31:43.200
I think we're all clear. You all right, sir?

31:43.320 --> 31:45.280
Fine.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.440
Teal'c!

31:50.840 --> 31:53.400
Lieutenant Tyler is not
what he appears to be.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.880
I know. He told me.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.720
Stand down.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.600
Let's go.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.040
(O'Neill) Why didn't you just ask for help?

32:17.160 --> 32:19.880
(Tyler) I'm sorry,
but I couldn't take the chance.

32:19.960 --> 32:23.520
For generations, the Reol have met
with nothing but fear and mistrust.

32:23.640 --> 32:27.120
Well, sure, if you go around
trickin' people.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.720
My kind do not embrace technology.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.120
We've never been good fighters.

32:32.240 --> 32:36.000
Our ability to disguise ourselves
is our only advantage.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.160
Now the Goa'uld are trying
to learn our secrets.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.600
We're being hunted to extinction.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.320
You got someplace to go?

32:46.440 --> 32:51.720
A group of us have started a colony on
a planet in an isolated part of the galaxy.

32:51.840 --> 32:56.600
After I return, we'll bury the gate
and no one'll ever hear of us again.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.720
(distant shouts)

33:30.880 --> 33:33.760
- What have we got?
- We are not alone.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.480
Looks like they're gonna be there awhile.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.160
We must act before
further reinforcements arrive.

33:59.280 --> 34:02.160
I don't think so, Teal'c.
There's too many of 'em.

34:02.240 --> 34:06.120
I'll surrender. Once they have me,
they'll leave. I'm the one they're after.

34:06.240 --> 34:09.120
That's very brave of you,
but the last thing we need

34:09.239 --> 34:13.440
is for the Goa'uld to figure out
how you do that... thing you do.

34:13.520 --> 34:16.840
Then I won't surrender.
I'll just lead them away from the gate.

34:16.960 --> 34:21.000
- That'll give you a chance to get through.
- You said they'd never stop hunting you.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.920
Now, we've trusted each other this far.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.159
We could use a little more
fire power, however.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.040
Daniel. Stay with...

34:38.159 --> 34:41.360
- What is your name, anyway?
- Kaiael.

34:45.280 --> 34:48.840
OK. Daniel, you stay with... Tyler.

34:50.239 --> 34:55.000
Carter, give him your zat. Keep an eye out
for patrols. Stay out of trouble.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.800
The glider's cannon
may still be operational.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.560
I like the attitude, Teal'c.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.800
This is all my fault.

35:30.920 --> 35:35.280
If I had revealed myself to you from the
beginning, this could have been avoided.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.720
Well, we understand.
No one's blaming you.

35:40.200 --> 35:44.760
Please tell Colonel O'Neill
I appreciate everything he's done for me.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.200
What are you talking about?

35:57.280 --> 36:00.160
I take it you're waiting to see me, Colonel.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.240
Yes, sir. For the better part
of an hour, in fact.

36:03.840 --> 36:04.880
What about?

36:05.000 --> 36:09.280
You allow your personal feelings
to influence your command decisions.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.840
How I run my command
is none of your damn business.

36:11.960 --> 36:16.440
- The security of this country, sir.
- This has nothing to do with security.

36:16.560 --> 36:20.600
Offworld teams have been compromised.
Existing safeguards are ineffective.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.800
SGC is an accident waiting to happen.

36:22.920 --> 36:26.800
I don't know who issued your orders,
but I've got a pretty good idea.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.320
With all due respect, it doesn't matter.

36:29.440 --> 36:31.800
What matters is that,
in carrying out my orders,

36:31.920 --> 36:34.480
I have found things to be
very, very wrong here.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.320
You're being used, Colonel.

36:36.440 --> 36:39.920
I let this investigation go on long enough
to make a few phone calls.

36:40.040 --> 36:43.680
I learned enough to know
your orders are politically motivated.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.760
I think you're missing my point.
I don't care.

36:47.360 --> 36:51.480
If it's a fight you're looking for, my
connections go a lot higher than yours.

36:51.560 --> 36:54.880
- Administrations change, sir.
- So do orders.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.360
Now, do I need to have you
escorted off my base?

36:59.320 --> 37:01.680
That won't be necessary, General.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.920
I know how to leave gracefully.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.000
I only hope you do.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.720
Daniel?

37:17.840 --> 37:19.800
Hey, where's Tyler?

37:21.760 --> 37:24.560
I would've asked,
but I was too busy being unconscious

37:24.640 --> 37:27.880
after he shot me with
that zat you gave him.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.160
Oh, for crying...

37:52.840 --> 37:55.200
He's trying to be a hero.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.440
There's only a few Jaffa left.
We could take them out.

38:05.560 --> 38:09.160
This may be our best chance
for escape, O'Neill.

39:53.840 --> 39:58.040
Lucky you're not really a lieutenant under
my command. I'd have your ass for this.

39:58.120 --> 40:01.520
- You could have escaped.
- We don't leave our people behind.

40:01.640 --> 40:06.080
But... I am not one of your people.

40:07.720 --> 40:11.200
Could've fooled me.
Actually, you did fool me.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.280
Come on. Let's go.

40:18.760 --> 40:22.520
- What about the Jaffa at the gate?
- They weren't a problem.

40:30.080 --> 40:34.200
You know, before your people go
and bury your gate, or anything like that,

40:34.320 --> 40:38.600
you should know that not everyone
you meet is gonna try and hunt you down.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.680
We could be allies, you know.

40:41.800 --> 40:45.920
It's not my decision to make, but I will
tell the others what happened here.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.960
It might just convince them
that we don't have to hide for ever.

40:57.600 --> 41:00.560
And maybe then you can take me fishing.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.520
