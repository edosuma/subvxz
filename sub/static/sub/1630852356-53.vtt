[chorus]â™ª <i>One, two, One-two-three-four</i>

00:34.817 --> 00:36.688
Hello, kids of DingDong!

00:36.732 --> 00:39.126
I'm Remy,
and this is my DingDong dance!

00:46.089 --> 00:48.135
Wow, I look cool!

00:48.178 --> 00:49.701
It's been a full ten seconds,

00:49.745 --> 00:51.114
let's see how many
likes I got so far!

00:51.138 --> 00:53.053
Zero!

00:53.096 --> 00:56.099
I've been posting
DingDongs all week!

00:56.143 --> 00:58.014
Why can't I get even
a single like?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.624
All my friends are so popular.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.104
Hey, watch me do this.

01:04.325 --> 01:07.197
Ay yo, pigeon talk!
Ha ha!

01:07.241 --> 01:09.112
Where the crumbies at?

01:09.156 --> 01:12.376
I ate twenty cups of barbecue
sauce for lunch today!

01:13.943 --> 01:15.249
<i>Five hundred likes?</i>

01:15.292 --> 01:17.512
Just for being cute?
I can be cute!

01:17.555 --> 01:20.819
Ahh...
Okay, this is demeaning.

01:20.863 --> 01:24.693
Hey, Remy! Remy!
Remy! Remy... Oof.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.738
Hey, Remy,
wanna come over later?

01:26.782 --> 01:29.176
Cricket!

01:29.219 --> 01:30.438
How'd you evenget up here?

01:30.481 --> 01:32.962
Oh, you know, I have my ways.

01:33.005 --> 01:34.181
My man.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.704
Wow!

01:35.747 --> 01:37.140
These are all likes!

01:37.184 --> 01:39.273
For Cricket sticking
to my window?

01:39.316 --> 01:41.231
<i>Wow, that kid is really funny!</i>

01:41.275 --> 01:43.320
<i>Let's get "wanna come
over later" trending!</i>

01:43.364 --> 01:45.148
DingDong dang!

01:45.192 --> 01:48.238
Huh. Wonder why people
like this DingDong so much?

01:51.589 --> 01:53.287
- Are you coming over or what?
- Yes!

01:53.330 --> 01:55.115
Yes, I am!

01:55.158 --> 01:56.638
Okay, great!

01:56.681 --> 01:58.422
The DingDong I uploaded of you

01:58.466 --> 02:00.424
sticking to my window is a hit!

02:00.468 --> 02:02.992
- And it's all because
of you!
- Wanna come over later?

02:03.035 --> 02:05.168
Everyone thinks
you're hilarious!

02:05.212 --> 02:08.171
- Can you please make
more DingDongs with me?
- I dunno. Why?

02:08.215 --> 02:11.000
Well, if we make
more DingDongs,
we'll get more followers.

02:11.043 --> 02:13.089
And if we get 100,000 followers,

02:13.133 --> 02:14.482
we'll be official DingDongers!

02:14.525 --> 02:16.223
We'll get a little check next
to our name,

02:16.266 --> 02:19.182
and maybe
we'll even get invited
as celebrity DingDongers

02:19.226 --> 02:20.531
to DingDong Con!

02:20.575 --> 02:22.272
We'll be dripping with clout...

02:22.316 --> 02:25.667
Ooh! Did you say trout?
I love me some trout.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.147
Cricket, no, it's <i>clout</i>.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.496
Trout season is coming up,

02:28.539 --> 02:30.324
we ought to start
preparing the bait.

02:30.367 --> 02:31.673
No, it's not...

02:31.716 --> 02:33.196
Oh my gosh!

02:33.240 --> 02:36.460
We just hit our first
thousand followers! Yay!

02:36.504 --> 02:38.810
Wow, you really like
this DingDong stuff, huh?

02:38.854 --> 02:42.945
I don't really get the appeal,
but I <i>do</i> get makin' my best bud happy!

02:42.988 --> 02:44.512
So you'll help me make more?

02:44.555 --> 02:46.253
You bet your sweet buns!

02:46.296 --> 02:48.342
Thank you, Cricket!
This is great!

02:48.385 --> 02:50.344
Validation, here we come!

02:52.346 --> 02:53.390
Where's Tilly going?

02:53.434 --> 02:55.349
- Hello Gloria.
- Oh hi, Tilly.

02:55.392 --> 02:56.915
May I please borrow your phone,

02:56.959 --> 02:58.917
so that I can make
my own DingDong account?

02:58.961 --> 03:01.006
DingDong?
You mean ChitChat?

03:01.050 --> 03:03.008
Oh, Gloria, I'm sorry,

03:03.052 --> 03:05.837
but I don't think anyone
uses ChitChat anymore.

03:05.881 --> 03:07.796
Kids these days
are all into DingDong.

03:07.839 --> 03:09.189
Allow me to show you.

03:09.232 --> 03:11.321
- Here.
- Oh, is this a vlog?

03:11.365 --> 03:15.064
Hotdog surgeon.

03:15.107 --> 03:17.849
<i>Wee-oo-wee-oo!</i>

03:20.069 --> 03:22.202
His heart.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.204
Buns...

03:24.247 --> 03:26.249
Well, it was gonna
happen one day.

03:26.293 --> 03:29.078
Your ol' pal, Gloria,
is finally too old
for the Internet.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.253
This is yours now.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.863
I am free.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.604
Alright,
what're we working with?

03:33.648 --> 03:35.954
Ooh, stream mode.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.739
Imma live stream the dog.

03:37.782 --> 03:41.830
Okay, Cricket, Let's see
if we can recreate the magic.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.353
What should I do?

03:43.397 --> 03:45.834
- Eh.
- Uh, What's up, chicken?

03:45.877 --> 03:47.836
Ow! Mama!

03:47.879 --> 03:50.317
And cut! And post!

03:50.360 --> 03:52.536
Remy, I think she ate
one of my toes!

03:52.580 --> 03:55.887
- Okay, okay!
- Remy likes the likes!

03:55.931 --> 03:57.628
Never mind! I miscounted.

03:57.672 --> 04:01.110
With Cricket's natural appeal,
and my brand awareness,

04:01.153 --> 04:02.807
there's no stopping us!

04:02.851 --> 04:05.027
Hey, Cricket, how 'bout
we follow this chicken motif

04:05.070 --> 04:07.812
- with some
"that feeling whens"?
- That feelings what?

04:07.856 --> 04:10.424
That feeling
when the weekend's over!

04:10.467 --> 04:12.121
What does that mean? Oof!

04:12.164 --> 04:13.383
Oh, I get it.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.645
It's working!

04:14.689 --> 04:16.256
Let's build on this.

04:16.299 --> 04:18.867
Okay. That feeling
when mom says, "No!"

04:18.910 --> 04:23.915
Now, is the goat my momor is the goat th...
Oh! Ah!

04:23.959 --> 04:25.700
How'd that look, Reymold?

04:25.743 --> 04:27.702
Cricket, this is great!
I've found my brand!

04:28.746 --> 04:30.400
Hey, what's a brand?

04:30.444 --> 04:32.663
That feeling when a goat
is driving a car.

04:32.707 --> 04:37.842
Huh, ah! Woah! Ah!

04:37.886 --> 04:39.453
And cut! Wow, Cricket,

04:39.496 --> 04:41.237
you're really
bringing in the follo...

04:41.281 --> 04:43.326
Oh my gosh!

04:43.370 --> 04:44.371
- Cricket!
- Dad?

04:44.414 --> 04:46.895
No, silly,
it's Remy! Look!

04:46.938 --> 04:49.332
100,00 follows!

04:49.376 --> 04:51.465
I'm verified!

04:53.554 --> 04:55.730
Happy for you.

04:55.773 --> 05:00.387
All right, Phoenix,
you are being streamed
live on the internet.

05:00.430 --> 05:03.868
Hm... You should do something
cute for all your fans.

05:03.912 --> 05:07.307
<i>Phoenix</i>, you're gonna
get us banned.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.746
Ha ha, now that is cute stuff!

05:11.789 --> 05:13.748
Now, let's see
what the fans think.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.967
Oh my gosh, no viewers?

05:16.011 --> 05:17.491
Phoenix would be devastated

05:17.534 --> 05:19.057
if she found out
no one was watching!

05:19.101 --> 05:20.581
She must never know.

05:23.540 --> 05:26.195
Nothing like the smell of grass

05:26.238 --> 05:28.980
and the glow of being
an official DingDonger!

05:29.024 --> 05:30.678
Let me just see it
one more time.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.332
W-w-wait! What happened?

05:32.375 --> 05:33.507
My official check is gone!

05:33.550 --> 05:34.788
And my follower count
is dropping!

05:34.812 --> 05:36.074
What's going on?

05:36.118 --> 05:37.293
"Where's the new videos?"

05:37.337 --> 05:38.357
"Ever since they got verified,

05:38.381 --> 05:39.426
they stopped caring!"

05:39.469 --> 05:41.384
"No new posts, unfollowed!"

05:41.428 --> 05:43.560
No, no, this is bad!
Cricket, get up!

05:43.604 --> 05:46.650
The fans demand more content!
You good to make another video?

05:46.694 --> 05:49.218
Whatever you say, buddy.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.481
Crickey will never let you down.

05:51.525 --> 05:55.485
Great! Oh man, I thinkI have an
idea for a stuntthat might double,

05:55.529 --> 05:58.532
no, triple our follower count!
I gotta spread the word!

05:58.575 --> 06:01.404
Hey, Big City!
Our craziest stunt yet

06:01.448 --> 06:04.320
is gonna be filmed today
at five at the skate park!

06:04.364 --> 06:06.148
Be there!
And posted!

06:06.191 --> 06:08.455
- Come on, we gotta set up!
- Be right there.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.588
<i>Phoenix would be crushed</i>

06:11.632 --> 06:13.329
<i>if she found out
she had no viewers.</i>

06:13.373 --> 06:15.157
I must protect her
from the truth,

06:15.200 --> 06:16.941
with a little Tilly magic.

06:16.985 --> 06:20.423
What was once no viewers
is now one viewer!

06:20.467 --> 06:23.034
Oh hey, Phoenix!

06:23.078 --> 06:24.514
Your viewer was just telling me

06:24.558 --> 06:26.995
how much of a fan
they are of your livestream.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.518
Why don't you say hello?

06:28.562 --> 06:30.433
And take a big look
at how it says

06:30.477 --> 06:32.174
one viewer at the bottom!

06:32.217 --> 06:33.349
Phoenix, what are you doing?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.438
You see it! You see the truth!

06:35.482 --> 06:39.181
Oh, Phoenix, I never meant
for you to find out!

06:39.224 --> 06:41.575
I just didn't want it
to hurt your self esteem!

06:41.618 --> 06:45.927
But insteadI have done something
absolutely despicable.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.451
I am a worm of shame!

06:48.495 --> 06:51.193
Shame, shame, shame, shame.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.805
<i>Hey, what's up, everybody!</i>

06:54.849 --> 06:57.591
It's your pal, Remy,
here at the Skate Park

06:57.634 --> 06:59.767
with the people of Big City!

07:01.638 --> 07:03.597
We're all here
for my greatest stunt yet!

07:03.640 --> 07:05.773
Allow me to introduce,

07:05.816 --> 07:09.037
"That face when you date
the goat!"

07:09.080 --> 07:11.431
<i>This stunt begins
at the top of the ramp,</i>

07:11.474 --> 07:13.563
<i>with our lovely date.</i>

07:13.607 --> 07:17.219
<i>But first, you need to meet
her parents in the pit!</i>

07:17.262 --> 07:19.177
<i>Then, it's a quick ollie
to dinner!</i>

07:19.221 --> 07:20.570
<i>Then to the dance club zone,</i>

07:20.614 --> 07:22.572
<i>but you gotta get past
the bouncer!</i>

07:22.616 --> 07:24.313
<i>Then dance the night away</i>

07:24.356 --> 07:26.446
<i>with these bees
we'll grind through,</i>

07:26.489 --> 07:29.884
<i>All before saying, "Good night,
goat," as you get shot in the air</i>

07:29.927 --> 07:33.017
<i>and land in a pool
of medical-grade hot sauce!</i>

07:33.061 --> 07:36.325
What do you think of that?

07:36.368 --> 07:38.501
Oh my gosh,
can you sign my phone!

07:38.545 --> 07:39.633
Can you endorse my brand?

07:39.676 --> 07:41.199
Can you do a collab with me?

07:41.243 --> 07:43.898
Hey, why do you look
so familiar?

07:43.941 --> 07:46.553
- Are you...
- Ha ha, that's right!

07:46.596 --> 07:48.990
It's ya boi, Itchaboi!

07:49.033 --> 07:52.689
- Comin' at you broke!
- Cause everyone's watching
DingDongs now

07:52.733 --> 07:54.822
and not my vlogs!

07:54.865 --> 07:56.911
- Oh, well, that's too bad.
- Listen, man!

07:56.954 --> 07:58.913
You gotta let me
collab with you!

07:58.956 --> 08:01.219
Your DingDongs are fire!

08:01.263 --> 08:03.004
People love seeing idiots
get hurt.

08:03.047 --> 08:05.615
How'd you convince that kid
to get beat up for free?

08:05.659 --> 08:07.225
What? Cricket's fine.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.376
I'd never do anything
to hurt him.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.490
Looking good.

08:10.533 --> 08:11.752
Feeling good.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.714
Oh no! Have I been
pushing Cricket too far?

08:17.758 --> 08:20.456
Though my body may
be breaking beyond repair,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.937
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you happy, Remy.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.678
- Oh!
- Ooh.

08:24.721 --> 08:27.594
Oh my gosh,
I put my best friend
in harm's way,

08:27.637 --> 08:29.683
all to be verified by strangers?

08:29.726 --> 08:32.642
That's verifiably stupid!

08:32.686 --> 08:34.644
I can't let him do this!

08:34.688 --> 08:36.646
But wait! What about
all your followers?

08:36.690 --> 08:38.300
What about the clout?

08:38.343 --> 08:40.737
- I don't care!
- Huh.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.522
Hey, who invited this old guy?

08:42.565 --> 08:45.829
Cricket! Call it off!

08:45.873 --> 08:48.832
Go off? Okay, sis.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.312
No!

08:50.355 --> 08:52.575
- Vasquez! Upsies! Ahh!
- Remy?

08:52.619 --> 08:54.490
Remy!

08:54.534 --> 08:56.710
- Uh oh!
- Uh oh!

08:56.753 --> 08:58.581
Ahh!

08:58.625 --> 09:01.410
The sheep is biting me!
The sheep is biting me!

09:01.453 --> 09:02.585
Hot soup! Ahh!

09:12.203 --> 09:14.771
Wowie-zowie.

09:14.815 --> 09:18.514
Remy! Your soft body
ain't used to that kind
of beat-em-up.

09:18.558 --> 09:22.866
- Are you okay, man?
- I'm sorry.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.565
Aw, buddy, come here.

09:25.608 --> 09:26.740
Ow.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.963
I'm sorry.
Love, Tilly.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.793
Oh, why would you forgive me!

09:36.837 --> 09:39.709
I've committed
the worst possible sin!

09:39.753 --> 09:43.539
I have lied to a dog.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.716
I shall now cast myself out.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.719
Hm? What was that, Phoenix?

09:49.763 --> 09:52.766
Do you mean it? Really?

09:52.809 --> 09:55.682
Oh my gosh, you're right!

09:55.725 --> 09:57.945
You did have one viewer
all along!

09:57.988 --> 09:59.642
It was me!

10:02.471 --> 10:04.908
I swear that I shall
never let the internet

10:04.952 --> 10:07.563
soil our friendship ever again.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.697
Uh, okay.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.612
Thank you, Phoenix.

10:13.787 --> 10:16.485
Splash me again.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.681
- Thank you, Mrs. Green.
- Thank you for washing us,
Gramma.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.663
I'm sorry, Cricket.
I got carried away

10:20.707 --> 10:22.970
with my desire
for online popularity.

10:23.013 --> 10:25.363
Aw man, it's fine.
The stunt was cool,

10:25.407 --> 10:27.714
and I'll always remember
what a chemical burn
feels like!

10:27.757 --> 10:29.629
It would've made
for a cool DingDong, though.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.631
Yeah, but who wants to be
the type of person

10:31.674 --> 10:33.720
that benefitsfrom the pain
of their friends?

10:33.763 --> 10:36.374
BRB, phone's poppin'.

10:36.418 --> 10:39.029
Oh wow, it's a new DingDong
from Benny!

10:39.073 --> 10:40.770
Check out the fools!

10:40.814 --> 10:43.164
Wow, it's the stunt,
he recorded it!

10:46.297 --> 10:49.518
Yup, that's how it happened.

10:49.561 --> 10:52.782
Can you believe your very eyes?

10:52.826 --> 10:56.090
- Benny's a platinum DingDonger?
- Whoa!

10:56.133 --> 10:59.659
That's right! I sold out
my friends for fame!

10:59.702 --> 11:01.661
Benny is a snake in the grass!
