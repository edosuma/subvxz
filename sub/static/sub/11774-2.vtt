WEBVTT

00:05.106 --> 00:07.241
( theme music playing )

00:15.049 --> 00:16.784
HMM.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.064
( yelling )

01:15.776 --> 01:17.378
( grunts )

01:17.478 --> 01:19.413
( yelling )

01:33.594 --> 01:35.062
FUCK. FUCKER.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.064
FUCK! AH!

01:37.165 --> 01:39.500
( yelling )

01:53.514 --> 01:56.016
- ( Loretta yelling )
HEY, L.D.!
- WHAT?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.719
I NEED
YOU UPSTAIRS-- NOW.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.423
YO, L.D.!
WHERE YOU AT?

02:02.523 --> 02:05.326
- ( yelling )
- L.D.!

02:11.732 --> 02:14.568
L.D., WHAT CHANNEL IS
THAT E! CHANNEL ON?

02:14.668 --> 02:17.305
- I CAN'T FIND IT.
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.872
- YEAH.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

02:18.972 --> 02:21.842
YOU CALLED ME UP TO ASK ME
ABOUT THE E! CHANNEL?

02:21.942 --> 02:25.446
I AM SO SORRY THAT
YOU HAD TO MAKE SUCH
A LONG TREK UP HERE.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.681
I'M SITTING HERE
SUFFERING WITH CANCER
AND YOU HAD TO WALK UP

02:27.781 --> 02:29.717
SOME LITTLE STAIRS.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, L.D.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.085
- WHAT WAS YOU DOING, ANYWAY?
- I ACTUALLY WAS OPENING UP

02:32.186 --> 02:35.589
ONE OF THOSE VACUUM-SEALED
PACKAGING AND I CUT
MYSELF ON IT.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.025
JEFF AND SUSIE
GOT ME THIS GPS--

02:38.125 --> 02:40.694
LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THIS.
I CAN'T OPEN THOSE PACKAGES.

02:40.794 --> 02:44.164
- BAM! THERE IT IS.
- WHY WOULD YOU MANUFACTURE
A PRODUCT THAT YOU CAN'T OPEN?

02:44.265 --> 02:46.867
L.D., I'VE GOT
AN APPOINTMENT
TOMORROW AT NOON

02:46.967 --> 02:49.136
TO GET MY HAIR
AND MY NAILS DONE.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.739
- I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME.
- AT NOON?

02:51.839 --> 02:54.408
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY, CANNOT DO IT. SORRY.

02:54.508 --> 02:58.145
- WHY CAN'T YOU?
- I'M SUPPOSED TO PLAY
GOLF TOMORROW.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.347
WELL, JUST MOVE IT
TO ANOTHER TIME.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.114
I CAN'T MOVE IT
TO ANOTHER TIME.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.783
CAN YOU PLAY
BEFORE OR AFTER?

03:02.883 --> 03:03.951
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU DRIVE?

03:04.051 --> 03:05.886
'CAUSE I HAVE CANCER

03:05.986 --> 03:08.622
- AND I WANT YOU
TO DRIVE ME.
- YOU DO HAVE CANCER.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.258
YES, I DO.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.460
BUT HOW DOES
IT AFFECT YOUR DRIVING?

03:13.761 --> 03:15.429
I DON'T THINK
THE DOCTOR WOULD
WANT ME TO DRIVE,

03:15.529 --> 03:17.465
SO I WOULD PREFER
FOR YOU TO TAKE ME.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.567
THE DOCTOR DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT DRIVING.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.002
- L.D., I HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT AT NOON.
- SHOULD WE CALL THE DOCTOR

03:22.102 --> 03:23.837
AND MAYBE ASK
ABOUT THE DRIVING?

03:23.937 --> 03:26.274
- JUST TO--
- L.D., DO YOU KNOW
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

03:26.374 --> 03:29.176
- TO HAVE CANCER?
- I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

03:29.277 --> 03:31.144
TO BE WITH SOMEONE
WHO HAS CANCER.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.580
OOH, SO THAT'S WHY
YOU SHOULD HAVE COMPASSION

03:32.680 --> 03:34.582
AND TOMORROW AT NOON
TAKE ME TO MY APPOINTMENT.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.017
- OKAY. OKAY.
- GOOD. GLAD WE'RE
CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.919
NOON TOMORROW.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.054
NO GOLF.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.656
I'M GOING
TO DINNER TONIGHT

03:42.756 --> 03:47.060
WITH JEFF, SUSIE AND LEWIS
AND HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.299
- DO YOU WANNA GO?
- ANY BLACK PEOPLE
GONNA BE THERE?

03:51.399 --> 03:55.002
- NO.
- WHY WOULD
I WANT TO GO?

03:55.102 --> 03:57.204
MIGHT BE SOME PEOPLE
WITH CANCER.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.440
NO, I--
I DON'T WANNA GO.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.476
- COULD YOU JUST
GET ME ANOTHER TEA?
- SURE.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.746
- AND IT'S TIME
TO MAKE MY JUICE.
- I'LL BE BACK.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.717
OH! L.D., HOLD ON.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.185
HEY, MAN, LET ME TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING REAL QUICK.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.021
HEY, I'VE GOT A FRIEND
NAMED ALTON, RIGHT.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.657
- WHO? ALTON?
- ALTON. ALTON.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.059
BIG "SEINFELD" FAN--
LOVED THE FREAKING SHOW.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.828
HE'S A LITTLE DEPRESSED
RIGHT NOW.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.497
TRYING TO, YOU KNOW--
MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE HIM
A CALL ON HIS BIRTHDAY?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.466
- HE'S A BIG "SEINFELD" FAN?
- BIG "SEINFELD" FAN!

04:25.566 --> 04:27.100
- FUCKING LOVES
THE SHOW, MAN.
- WOW.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.969
GOT A FINE-ASS WIFE.
WIFE FINE AS HELL--

04:29.069 --> 04:30.904
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THE GUY SO DEPRESSED
WITH A WIFE THAT DAMN FINE.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.073
- REALLY? REALLY?
- SICK FINE. I'M TALKING
SICK FINE.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.608
- GORGEOUS?
- SICK MEANING "GOOD."

04:34.708 --> 04:36.644
- I GOT IT. YEAH. YEAH.
- YOU GET THAT SHIT, RIGHT?

04:36.744 --> 04:38.245
I'VE NEVER SEEN
THE DAMN SHOW MYSELF,

04:38.346 --> 04:40.047
BUT HE FRICKING
SWEARS BY IT.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.916
- WELL... ALL RIGHT, FINE.
- YOU'LL GIVE HIM A CALL?

04:43.016 --> 04:44.718
- I'LL CALL HIM LATER.
- IF YOU CAN GIVE HIM
A FUCKING CALL--

04:44.818 --> 04:46.554
LEAVE THE PHONE NUMBER
ON MY DRESSER.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.456
I'LL LEAVE THE NUMBER FOR YOU.
HE'S GONNA FUCKING FLIP OUT,

04:48.556 --> 04:50.791
HIM AND HIS FINE-ASS
FUCKING WIFE.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.263
Well, my next guest is,
to say the least,

04:56.364 --> 04:58.732
a maverick in the field
of cancer treatment.

04:58.832 --> 05:02.202
Her newest book is titled
"Walking Out on Cancer."

05:02.302 --> 05:04.672
Please say hello
to Dr. Karen Trundle.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.341
- ( TV audience applauds )
- Dr. Phil: Now, Dr. Trundle,

05:07.441 --> 05:09.743
how does somebody
walk out on cancer?

05:09.843 --> 05:14.147
Trundle: I do
believe that a patient's
personal relationships

05:14.247 --> 05:16.116
can contribute
to their cancer,

05:16.216 --> 05:19.920
just like living next
to a toxic waste dump can
actually cause cancer.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.289
If I determine
that a patient of mine

05:22.390 --> 05:24.925
is in a toxic relationship
with their spouse,

05:25.025 --> 05:27.861
I will counsel them
to leave that spouse.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.931
When we're talking
about a toxic spouse,

05:31.031 --> 05:33.066
we're talking
about what?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.168
Well, someone who
is impatient,

05:35.268 --> 05:36.970
someone who's obnoxious,

05:37.070 --> 05:39.407
someone who is petty
and argumentative,

05:39.507 --> 05:41.875
and obsesses
over meaningless details

05:41.975 --> 05:44.177
at the expense
of a harmonious relationship.

05:44.277 --> 05:47.214
Okay, so you're
telling me if you met
with a new patient

05:47.314 --> 05:50.884
and you saw that
they were married
to a person like that--

05:50.984 --> 05:54.788
I would counsel them to leave
and to never look back.

05:54.888 --> 05:58.426
( Dr. Phil chuckles )
And that's how they
walk out on cancer?

05:58.526 --> 06:00.193
We've got a couple
of your patients here--

06:00.293 --> 06:03.263
DRINK IT UP.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

06:03.363 --> 06:07.668
ATTAGIRL!
GOOD JOB! GOOD JOB!

06:07.768 --> 06:09.302
- THANKS, L.D.
- GOOD JOB.

06:09.403 --> 06:12.506
HEY, I HEARD ABOUT
THIS GREAT DOCTOR

06:12.606 --> 06:16.343
AND I TOOK
THE LIBERTY OF MAKING
AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU--

06:16.444 --> 06:18.679
FOR US, ACTUALLY,
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO TOO.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.714
SO WHAT WRONG
WITH THE DOCTOR I'VE GOT?

06:20.814 --> 06:23.183
THE DOCTOR YOU HAVE
IS PERFECTLY FINE

06:23.283 --> 06:24.985
BUT GET A SECOND OPINION.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.589
- WHERE'D YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS DOCTOR?
- A FRIEND OF MINE.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.057
- A FRIEND OF YOURS?
- MM-HMM.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.625
- WHO?
- PHIL.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.762
- PHIL WHO?
- PHIL KREEL...TON.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.731
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
SECOND OPINION.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.500
I'M GONNA TRUST YOU
ON THIS ONE, L.D.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.268
I'VE GOT
A VERY GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THIS DOCTOR,

06:41.368 --> 06:44.037
AND WHEN I GET
A FEELING...

06:44.137 --> 06:47.475
- YOU'VE GOT A FEELING.
- ...I GET A FEELING.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.077
THANKS FOR
THE LOOK OUT, L.D.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.615
( beeping )

06:56.684 --> 06:59.720
- Man: Hello?
- OY, ALTON, THIS IS
LARRY DAVID.

06:59.820 --> 07:03.491
- Who? Larry?
- LARRY DAVID FROM
THE "SEINFELD" SHOW.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.426
Larry--
oh, Larry David?

07:06.527 --> 07:08.361
I'M A FRIEND OF LEON'S.
HE TOLD ME TO GIVE YOU A CALL.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.631
- HE SAID
IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY.
- Oh, man!

07:10.731 --> 07:12.733
I can believe
you're calling me.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.902
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ALTON.
- That's amazing.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.605
Man, "Seinfeld" is one
of my favorite shows
of all time.

07:17.705 --> 07:21.809
OH, GREAT.
ANYWAY, SO HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

07:21.909 --> 07:25.646
- Thank you.
- AND, YOU KNOW, LEON SAID
YOU WERE A LITTLE DEPRESSE.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.682
- Yeah.
- ALTHOUGH THEN HE SAID
YOUR WIFE WAS BEAUTIFUL,

07:28.782 --> 07:30.684
SO I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE
DEPRESSED ABOUT, REALLY.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.286
What-- what do you mean
about my wife?

07:33.386 --> 07:36.690
- WHAT?
- My w-- why is
he talking about my wife?

07:36.790 --> 07:39.560
HE'S NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOUR WIFE. HE JUST
SAID SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.461
Yeah, okay. Well,
I know she's beautiful

07:41.562 --> 07:43.597
but why is Leon
telling you that
my wife is beautiful?

07:43.697 --> 07:45.365
- HE'S COMPLIMENTING HER.
- That's not a compliment!

07:45.465 --> 07:47.601
That's like
another man looking
at another man's woman.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.937
- HE DIDN'T SAY SHE WAS UGLY.
- I knew it was like that!

07:50.037 --> 07:51.905
I've seen them together
at the house talking,

07:52.005 --> 07:54.842
- always laughing. I knew it!
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:54.942 --> 07:56.910
- I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.
- Yo, is he there?!

07:57.010 --> 07:59.046
- ANYWAY,
IT'S GREAT TALKING TO YOU.
- Put him on the phone!

07:59.146 --> 08:01.048
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
AND GOOD LUCK.
SEE YOU AROUND.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.483
- Where you at right now?
Tell me where you at!
- ( beeps )

08:03.584 --> 08:05.519
( phone clatters )

08:12.025 --> 08:14.695
- HEY, I-- I--
- HEY.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.463
- OH, HEY.
- JUST IN TIME.

08:16.564 --> 08:19.466
- WE JUST SAT DOWN.
- OH, IS THAT LEWIS'S
NEW GIRLFRIEND?

08:19.567 --> 08:21.602
YEAH. YEAH YEAH.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL, HUH?

08:21.702 --> 08:24.538
- Larry: IT'S NOT GONNA LAST.
- Jeff: YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS

08:24.638 --> 08:26.073
AND YOU'VE GOT
TO SWEAR TO SECRECY.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.508
- YOU SWEAR TO SECRECY?
- COME ON, I'M A VAULT.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.477
ON THE WAY OVER HERE,

08:30.578 --> 08:32.713
SHE BLEW HIM IN THE CAR.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.449
OH YEAH.
OH YEAH.

08:36.550 --> 08:39.252
- BLOWJOB IN THE CAR?
- WHILE HE'S DRIVING.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.121
WOW, HOW GENTILE.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.156
NOT GONNA
GET THAT CLOSE TO HER,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.827
- OKAY OKAY.
- BY THE WAY, I DON'T APPROVE OF
A BLOWJOB IN THE CAR AT ALL.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.062
- REALLY?
- MORE DANGEROUS THAN
CELL PHONES IN MY OPINION.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.632
- WHAT ABOUT HANDJOBS?
- ANY KIND OF JOB IS DANGEROUS.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.066
IT HAS TO AFFECT THE DRIVER.
I CAN'T DENY IT.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.902
I THINK IT SHOULD
BE ILLEGAL, FRANKLY.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.303
BY THE WAY,
WHY DO THEY CALL IT A JOB?

08:56.403 --> 08:58.872
IS IT SO HARD?
IS IT A LOT OF WORK?

08:58.972 --> 09:00.908
- WELL, TUGGING, SUCKING.
- TUGGING.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.476
IT'S A LOT OF WORK.
I WOULDN'T WANT TO DO IT.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.580
IT IS A JOB. NO WONDER
WHY THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.515
OH, LOOK WHO
FINALLY COMES OVER.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.183
- HEY. HELLO.
- HI. BEVERLY.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.785
HI. LARRY. HI.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.687
WHERE HAVE
YOU GUYS BEEN, HUH?

09:13.787 --> 09:15.388
- HUH? OH, YOU KNOW--
- JUST TALKING, CATCHING UP.

09:15.488 --> 09:17.324
- WE'RE SITTING HERE
FOR LIKE AN HOUR...
- YEAH, SORRY.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.126
- ...THERE'S NO BREAD,
THE SERVICE SUCKS.
- NO BREAD.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.161
DON'T YOU GUYS WANT
A DRINK? NO DRINKS.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.097
I'D LOVE A DRINK.
WHAT-- WHAT IS THAT?
THAT LOOKS INTERESTING.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.635
- THAT DRINK.

POMEGRANATE SURPRISE.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.469

BLUEBERRY JUICE.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.605
HERE, HAVE A TRY.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.574
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT--
ANTIOXIDANTS, TEQUILA.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.077
IT'S FABULOUS. MMM.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.947
- MMM MMM.
- lewis: LOOK AT
THE SALT ON THAT RIM.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.783
- HERE. COME ON,
GIVE IT A TRY.
- NO NO. NO, THANKS.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.251
- I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT
- I DON'T THINK SO.
THANK YOU.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.453
- TAKE A LITTLE SIP.
- NO! NO.

09:46.553 --> 09:49.489
I DON'T LIKE
TO TAKE SIPS.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.391
I DON'T.
I DON'T TAKE
BITES EITHER.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.126
NO BITES,
NO SIPS. YEAH.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.462
- OH, HEY, BREAD. FABULOUS.
- Susie: FINALLY.

09:55.562 --> 09:56.930
- LOOK AT THIS.
- ABOUT TIME.

09:57.030 --> 10:00.133
I'M STARVING.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.802
Susie:
THANK YOU, LAR.
VERY NICE OF YOU.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.536
A PLEASURE. PLEASURE.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.605
- I'VE GOT
THE NEXT ONE, BUDDY.
- DO YOU?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.407
YOU GOING
TO MICHAEL YORK'S PARTY?

10:07.507 --> 10:09.643
MICHAEL YORK'S PARTY.
YOU KNOW, I REALLY LOVE
MICHAEL YORK,

10:09.743 --> 10:13.480
BUT THE GUY--
HE LIVES IN THE BOONDOCKS.
I'LL NEVER FIND THE PLACE.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.048
WHAT ABOUT THAT
NAV SYSTEM WE GAVE YOU?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.717
GREAT GIFT,
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.852
I COULDN'T OPEN--
I COULDN'T OPEN THE PACKAGE.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.689
- Susie: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- IT COMES-- IT'S ENTOMBED
IN THIS PLASTIC.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.291
I WAS STABBING
IT WITH A KNIFE.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.793
THERE'S A TAB.
YOU PULL THE TAB.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.861
- NO, THERE WAS NO TAB, SUSIE.
- NO PERFORATION?

10:27.961 --> 10:31.699
- NO, NO PERFORATION-- NOTHING.
- JUST GET AN X-ACTO KNIFE

10:31.799 --> 10:33.300
- OR A BOX CUTTER, OKAY?
- THERE YOU GO.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.235
- A BOX CUTTER?
- Jeff: YES.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.871
WHO AM I, MOHAMED ATTA?
I GOTTA BUY A BOX CUTTER?

10:37.971 --> 10:41.241
- I MEAN IT'S CRAZY.
- WE'RE LATE. WE'RE GONNA
GO SEE "LAST TANGO IN PARIS,"

10:41.341 --> 10:43.877
- MY FAVORITE FILM,
FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME.
- OH MY, "LAST TANGO IN PARIS."

10:43.977 --> 10:45.178
WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.114
( mimics Brando )
"PUT BUTTER UP MY ASS."

10:47.214 --> 10:48.882
I MEAN, IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO BE A MOVIE?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.151
PRETENTION MASQUERADING AS ART--
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT THERE.

10:51.251 --> 10:55.022
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
FOREIGN FILMS OR ANYTHING.
IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.957
- WE'VE GOTTA GO.
WE'RE GONNA MISS THE FILM.
- HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

10:57.057 --> 10:59.659
- SUSIE, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- BYE, BEVERLY. YOU TOO.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.763
- OH, LARRY.
- AH!

11:04.464 --> 11:05.766
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH YOU?

11:05.866 --> 11:07.735
- WHAT?
- SINCE YOU ARRIVED,

11:07.835 --> 11:09.569
YOU'VE JUST BEEN... WEIRD.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.039
- WHAT? NO.
- YEAH, I WAS JUST SO
LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING--

11:12.139 --> 11:15.042
- OH!
- I-I'M-- I'M SORRY.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.445
HOLY SH--

11:18.545 --> 11:20.580
WHAT THE FUCK
DID YOU DO?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.883
SHE WANTED YOU
TO HAVE A LITTLE DRINK.
YOU WOULDN'T TAKE IT.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.218
SHE WANTED
TO KISS YOU GOODBYE
LIKE AN AUNT IN BROOKLYN

11:25.318 --> 11:26.754
AT A SEDER.
YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THAT?

11:26.854 --> 11:28.555
WHAT IS SHE, A LEPER,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE?

11:28.655 --> 11:31.258
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
- YES, I WANT TO KNOW WHY.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.061
- ( silent )
- COME ON, TELL ME THE TRUTH.
DON'T LIE TO ME.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.829
- YOU KNOW, DON'T LIE.
- NO, 'CAUSE I HAVE--

11:35.929 --> 11:37.798
OKAY, I HAVE A COLD SORE
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO KISS HER.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.133
- YOU HAVE A COLD SORE?
- YEAH.

11:40.233 --> 11:43.370
AND I WAS--
I WAS EMBARRASSED.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.506
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HER?
- I WAS EMBARRASSED.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.542
- I'M SORRY.
- Lewis: UH-HUH.

11:49.642 --> 11:50.944
I'LL NEVER
GET LAID AGAIN.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.413
JUST TELL
THE WHOLE RESTAURANT.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.488
LARRY!

12:01.588 --> 12:04.357
- ( bells ring )
- HEY, LARRY!

12:05.759 --> 12:07.227
LARRY!

12:07.327 --> 12:10.597
- YOU GOT X-ACTO KNIVES?
- SURE, RIGHT HERE.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.333
OH, OKAY.
CAN I SEE THAT RED ONE?

12:13.433 --> 12:16.503
- SURE THING.
- JEEZ, I CAN'T OPEN
THE VACUUM-SEALED PACKAGING.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.840
- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
YOU CAN'T OPEN IT.
- OH YEAH.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.041
- I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.
- OKAY.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.076
- ( bells ring )
- LARRY.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.611
WHY'D YOU TELL ALTON
I WAS FUCKING HIS WIFE?

12:24.711 --> 12:26.113
WHAT? COME HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

12:26.213 --> 12:27.948
YOU TOLD ALTON
I'M FUCKING HIS WIFE?

12:28.048 --> 12:31.251
NO, I SAID THAT YOU SAID
THAT HIS WIFE WAS BEAUTIFUL,

12:31.351 --> 12:33.620
AND THAT'S ALL I SAID.
THAT'S ALL I SAID.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.022
WHEN YOU SAID
THAT SHIT TO HIM,

12:35.122 --> 12:36.857
THAT'S IMPLYING
THAT I'M FUCKING HER.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.259
- WELL, JUST TELL HIM
THAT YOU'RE NOT.
- BUT I AM!

12:39.359 --> 12:40.928
- YOU ARE?
- I'M TAPPING THAT ASS!

12:41.028 --> 12:42.930
I'VE BEEN KUNG-FUING
THAT ASS FOR A WHILE NOW.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.832
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
- SAID, FUCKING THAT ASS--
THEY'RE THE SAME THING.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.666
WHY DO YOU FOOL AROUND
WITH MARRIED WOMEN?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.601
- ASS IS ASS, LARRY.
- ASS IS NOT ASS.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.703
- ASS IS FUCKING ASS, LARRY.
IT'S WHAT THE FUCK I DO.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.572
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TAP EVERY ASS.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.174
DO YOU? DO YOU HAVE
TO TAP EVERY ASS?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.909
WHAT THE FUCK
WE GONNA DO RIGHT NOW?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.879
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WE"?
- ALTON'S GONNA FUCK
SOMEBODY UP.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.748
I HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS!
I'M NOT TAPPING ANYBODY!

13:01.849 --> 13:03.450
YOU'RE TAPPING!
I'M NOT TAPPING!

13:03.550 --> 13:05.585
YOU ARE COMBINED IN
THIS SHIT WITH ME NOW,
GOD DAMN IT.

13:05.685 --> 13:07.654
WE ARE LEGO.
WE ARE A FUCKING
LEGO SET RIGHT NOW.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.057
WE ARE FUCKING
INTERLOCKED TOGETHER.
WE FUCKED HER.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.558
GET AWAY FROM ME.
GET OUT OF HERE.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.027
- FIX THIS SHIT. FIX IT!
- I'M NOT FIXING ANYTHING.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.529
$10.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.269
FIRST OF ALL, LORETTA,
I WANT TO SAY

13:22.369 --> 13:24.604
HOW SORRY I AM TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR DIAGNOSIS,

13:24.704 --> 13:27.707
BUT I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU THROUGH THIS...

13:27.807 --> 13:29.409
- THANK YOU, DR. TRUNDLE.
- ...WITHOUT A DOUBT.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.878
( sputtering )

13:30.978 --> 13:32.379
AND THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S
HAPPENING TOMORROW NIGHT.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.215
I'M ACTUALLY GIVING A TALK
ON COPING STRATEGIES...

13:35.315 --> 13:37.951
- YOU EVER DO THAT?
- ...FOR NEWLY-DIAGNOSED
PATIENTS AND I THINK--

13:38.051 --> 13:40.888
IT'S LIKE HOW
HORSES DO IT, RIGHT?

13:40.988 --> 13:43.390
AND I CAN SEE
WHY THEY DO IT.
IT FEELS GOOD.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.793
HOW LONG HAVE YOU ALL
BEEN TOGETHER? THIS SEEMS...

13:46.894 --> 13:48.628
IT'S BEEN ABOUT A--

13:48.728 --> 13:50.363
...LIKE A FAIRLY NEW
RELATIONSHIP.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.765
- IT'S BEEN
ABOUT A YEAR NOW.
- ABOUT A YEAR?

13:52.866 --> 13:54.301
HOW-- HOW WOULD YOU
DESCRIBE THESE ARTIFACTS?

13:54.401 --> 13:56.003
WHAT IS IT EXACTLY?

13:56.103 --> 13:58.705
- THAT'S AFRICAN ART.
- AFRICAN?

13:58.805 --> 14:01.574
- REALLY?
HEY-- AFRICAN.
- YES.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.277
WHAT, I'M SUPPOSED
TO HAVE A CONNECTION
TO HER 'CAUSE I'M BLACK?

14:04.377 --> 14:06.313
DUH!

14:07.747 --> 14:10.317
MR. DAVID,
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT,

14:10.417 --> 14:12.385
- SO I CAN JUST FINISH UP
THE HISTORY HERE.
- SURE. OKAY, SURE.

14:12.485 --> 14:16.990
SO ARE YOU ALL
IN WHAT YOU WOULD CALL

14:17.090 --> 14:19.659
A HAPPY, HEALTHY,
COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP?

14:19.759 --> 14:22.162
A HAPPY AND A HEALTHY
NEW YEAR TO YOU.

14:22.262 --> 14:25.498
- A HAPPY AND A HEALTHY--
- NO, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
OUR RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW.

14:25.598 --> 14:29.302
- OKAY, YES.
- WE-- WE GET ALONG
MOST OF THE TIME.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.571
WHO'S THIS GUY?
IS THAT YOUR HUSBAND?

14:31.671 --> 14:35.208
- YES.
- OY, HE'S GOT SOME HEALTHY
HEAD OF HAIR, THIS ONE.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.445
YES, HE WAS
BLESSED FOLLICLY, YES.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.314
OH, HE WAS BLESSED.
SO, WHAT? I'M UNBLESSED.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

14:41.414 --> 14:42.815
NO, I WASN'T REFERRING
TO YOU AT ALL.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.084
BALD PEOPLE
ARE NOT BLESSED?

14:44.184 --> 14:45.685
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.455
WE DON'T BELONG ON THE SAME
PLANET AS THE BLESSED HAIRS?

14:48.555 --> 14:52.159
NOW, AS I WAS SAYING,
THE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP
THAT YOU HAVE,

14:52.259 --> 14:54.194
DO YOU FEEL THAT
YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS...

14:54.294 --> 14:56.496
- Larry: OOH.
- ...IN A COMFORTABLE,
EASY PLACE?

14:56.596 --> 14:58.598
WE HAVE DIFFERENCES
AND THINGS LIKE THAT...

14:58.698 --> 15:00.867
- Larry: OH YEAH.
- ...BUT OVERALL WE GET
ALONG PRETTY GOOD.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.869
YOU KNOW,
THE CANCER, HOW MUCH--

15:02.970 --> 15:05.238
( sings commercial jingle )

15:07.507 --> 15:09.042
- YOU REMEMBER THAT COMMERCIAL?
- ( forcefully ) NO.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.577
- EVER SEE THAT ONE?
- I HAVE A GREAT IDEA:

15:10.677 --> 15:12.845
THERE ARE SOME
GREAT MAGAZINES
RIGHT OUTSIDE.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.382
- RIGHT, SINCE HE CAN'T FOCUS.
- I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS
WITH LORETTA

15:15.482 --> 15:18.551
SOME VERY INTIMATE,
PERSONAL THINGS THAT,
AS A WOMAN,

15:18.651 --> 15:20.687
IN TERMS
OF SELF-IMAGE, I THINK WOULD
BE BETTER DISCUSSED...

15:20.787 --> 15:22.990
- THAT WOULD SO WORK FOR ME TOO.
- ...JUST IN OUR COMPANY.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.958
YEAH, MAYBE YOU'LL FIND
A MAGAZINE OUT THERE

15:25.058 --> 15:26.793
- THAT'LL WORK FOR YOU.
- I UNDERSTAND.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.928
- ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
- DISCUSS, YOU TWO,
YOU SIT, YOU TALK.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.663
YOU'LL HAVE COFFEE.
YOU'LL DISCUSS.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.932
DISCUSS. YOU'LL TALK.
YOU'LL DO THIS.
YOU'LL DO THAT.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.136
- HAVE SOME GIRL TIME.
- YOU ENJOY YOURSELVES,
HAVE A GOOD DISCUSSION.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.305
I'LL BE OUT THERE.
YOU'LL BE HERE.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.273
WE'LL TALK-- LAT.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.375
( grumbles )

15:44.344 --> 15:48.448
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO HEAR SOMETHING
VERY DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.986
- ( people chatting )
- ( sighs )

15:54.387 --> 15:59.692
- 6:00.
- AH. MR. TRUNDLE?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.095
- YEAH.
- I SAW YOUR PICTURE
ON YOUR WIFE'S DESK.

16:02.195 --> 16:05.198
OH, RIGHT.
TAKE CARE THEN.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.634
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.937
- ( grunts )
- LARRY?

16:11.038 --> 16:15.008
LARRY DAVID.
DEAN. DEAN WEINSTOCK.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.510
- OH MY GOD. HEY.
- YEAH, USED TO BE YOUR
NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.113
- YEAH. HEY.
- HEY, MAN. IT IS
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.881
- HEY HEY.
- ( glasses crunch )

16:21.981 --> 16:23.383
- WHOA!
- OH, CHRIST!

16:23.483 --> 16:27.054
- OH MY GOD.
- THESE ARE-- ARE BROKEN.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.621
- OH, DEAR.
- THANK YOU.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.491
- OH, MAN.
- IT IS JUST SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU, MAN.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.326
- THAT'S AWESOME.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.395
- IT'S GREAT.
- I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR GLASSES.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.530
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'LL SEND YOU A BILL.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.533
TELL ME,
HOW'S CHERYL? HOW'S--
WHERE'D YOU GUYS MOVE TO?

16:40.633 --> 16:43.803
WHA-- WHAT-- YOU'LL WHAT?
YOU'LL SEND ME A BILL?

16:43.903 --> 16:46.773
- IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID?
- YEAH, THESE ARE-- I DON'T
THINK THESE CAN BE FIXED.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.808
- WAIT A SECOND.
- YEAH?

16:48.908 --> 16:52.279
- YOU'RE GONNA SEND ME A BILL?
- JUST FOR THE GLASSES.

16:52.379 --> 16:55.014
- WHY?
- 'CAUSE THEY'RE LIKE $219.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.218
I-- I DIDN'T BREAK
YOUR GLASSES.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.220
IT WAS THE HUG THAT BROKE 'EM.
IT WASN'T YOU SPECIFICALLY...

17:00.320 --> 17:02.355
- OKAY, YEAH.
- ...BUT YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO INSTIGATED THE HUG.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.723
I DIDN'T INST--
I INSTIGATED THE HUG?

17:03.823 --> 17:05.692
YEAH, I CAME IN
FOR LIKE A SHAKE--

17:05.792 --> 17:08.661
NO, I CAME IN FOR A SHAKE
AND THEN I SAW YOU MAKE
A MOVE FOR THE HUG,

17:08.761 --> 17:12.165
- SO I WENT IN.
- I KINDA REMEMBER
I SAID THE "HEY."

17:12.265 --> 17:14.201
I THINK YOU'RE MISTAKING
MY "HEY" FOR A HUG.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.835
EVEN IF I DID
INITIATE THE HUG...

17:15.935 --> 17:17.570
- YES? YEAH?
- ...WHICH I DIDN'T,

17:17.670 --> 17:20.773
THAT STILL DOESN'T
MAKE ME RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR GLASSES.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.609
THEY'RE YOUR GLASSES.
THEY'RE AROUND YOUR NECK.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.245
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I FEEL LIKE YOU DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE ME

17:25.345 --> 17:27.780
THEN I DID THE "HEY,"
THEN I DID THE SHAKE,

17:27.880 --> 17:30.183
THEN YOU CAME IN AND,
BECAUSE YOU WERE SO EMBARRASSED

17:30.283 --> 17:33.920
AND SO MORTIFIED THAT
YOU DID NOT RECOGNIZE ME,

17:34.020 --> 17:35.855
YOU OVERCOMPENSATED
BY A SUPERSTRONG HUG

17:35.955 --> 17:38.558
- THAT BROKE MY GLASSES.
- OKAY, THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY
IDIOTIC THEORY.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.260
I THINK, BECAUSE YOU'RE
A NEEDY PERSON,

17:40.360 --> 17:42.095
YOU WANTED ME TO LIKE YOU,
SO YOU HUGGED ME.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.630
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M NOT A NEEDY PERSON.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.899
OKAY? THAT'S NUMBER ONE.
I HAVE NO NEEDS
AT ALL, OKAY?

17:46.999 --> 17:49.702
I WASN'T OVERCOMPENSATING.
I DON'T LIKE YOU. WHY WOULD
I WANT TO HUG YOU?

17:49.802 --> 17:51.971
- ALL RIGHT.
- I'M NOT PAYING
FOR YOUR GLASSES.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.773
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO PAY FOR THE GLASSES.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.509
I'M ASKING YOU
TO REPLACE THESE
GLASSES THAT YOU BROKE.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.479
I'M STILL PAYING FOR THEM
EVEN IF I REPLACE THEM,

17:59.579 --> 18:01.148
AM I NOT?
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

18:01.248 --> 18:03.150
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW
AN OPTOMETRIST. I DON'T KNOW.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.452
- NO, I DON'T KNOW
ANY OPTOMETRISTS.
- WELL, I DIDN'T THINK YOU DID

18:05.552 --> 18:07.720
SO, IN THAT CASE,
THAT'S WHY I'M INVOICING YOU.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.557
OKAY, YOU SEND ME THE INVOICE.
I'M GOING TO RIP IT UP INTO
TINY LITTLE PIECES

18:10.657 --> 18:13.793
- AND I MIGHT EVEN PEE ON IT.
- WHY-- WHY ARE WE
FIGHTING IN HERE?

18:13.893 --> 18:16.163
WE'RE FIGHTING
BECAUSE YOU'RE A MORON.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE FIGHTING.

18:16.263 --> 18:19.098
YOU KNOW
I HAVE CANCER, RIGHT?

18:19.199 --> 18:21.668
YOU KNOW
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.305
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
A FIGHT WITH YOU.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.141
IN FACT, MY DOCTOR SAID
TO NOT HAVE ANY FIGHTS AT ALL.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.678
OKAY, I'LL--

18:33.746 --> 18:35.782
I'LL PAY
FOR THE GLASSES.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.750
YOU'LL REPLACE
THE GLASSES.

18:39.419 --> 18:42.054
I'LL PAY
FOR THE GLASSES.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.924
I APPRECIATE YOU
ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.394
IT FEELS GOOD, RIGHT?

18:55.502 --> 18:59.005
I GOT A PRETTY GOOD VIBE
FROM THAT DOCTOR.

18:59.105 --> 19:02.175
PRETTY PRETTY

19:02.275 --> 19:05.011
PRETTY PRETTY GOOD.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.579
YEAH, SHE'S PRETTY SMART.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.981
YEAH. YEAH, WHAT DID
YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT?

19:09.081 --> 19:12.619
SHE TOLD ME THERE'S
CERTAIN THINGS I'VE GOT TO
DO TO MAKE SURE I GET WELL.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.254
WELL, YOU GOT TO DO 'EM,
YOU'VE GOT TO DO 'EM.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.289
- YEAH.
- IF THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID,

19:16.389 --> 19:18.191
YOU'VE GOT TO
LISTEN TO THE DOCTOR.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.393
BECAUSE WITHOUT YOUR HEALTH,
YOU'RE NOTHING.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.329
SOME PEOPLE ARE NOTHING
EVEN WITH HEALTH.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.631
I FALL INTO
THAT CATEGORY SOMETIMES.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.666
A NOTHING--
A BIG NOTHING--
AND I HAVE HEALTH.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.302
I WOULD LIKE TO GO
TO HER LECTURE TOMORROW.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.305
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL DRIVE YOU.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

19:34.407 --> 19:36.676
( doorbell rings )

19:39.912 --> 19:41.080
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.749
YOU KILLED ANOTHER
RELATIONSHIP.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.618
- I DID?
- THAT'S RIGHT,
AND A VERY SPECIAL ONE, TOO.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.587
THIS IS MAYBE
THE MOST SPECIAL ONE
I EVER HAD.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.356
REALLY?
THE LAST ONE WAS SPECIAL.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.723
I MADE A MISTAKE
ON THAT ONE.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.259
THERE HAVE BEEN
QUITE A FEW SPECIAL GIRLS.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.192
I'VE MADE MISTAKES.
NOT THIS ONE.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.227
THIS ONE'S MORE SPECIAL?

19:54.327 --> 19:55.695
THIS IS THE MOST SPECIAL.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.764
- NO QUESTION ABOUT IT?
- NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.133
IS SHE THE MOST SPECIAL
OUT OF ALL THE SPECIAL GIRLS
YOU'VE TAKEN OUT?

20:01.234 --> 20:03.135
- I THINK SHE MIGHT BE.
- REALLY?

20:03.236 --> 20:04.871
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND SHE NEEDS AN APOLOGY.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.873
OKAY? SO COME ON.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.576
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO SAY?

20:09.676 --> 20:12.412
I DON'T--
TELL HER THE TRUTH--
YOU KNOW, THE THING.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.615
- OKAY, FINE.
- THANK YOU.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.785
YOU'D BETTER GET ME
OUT OF THIS.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.822
HEY, BEVERLY.
I-- HONESTLY,

20:22.922 --> 20:26.693
I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE RESTAURANT

20:26.793 --> 20:29.128
BUT, UM--

20:29.228 --> 20:30.897
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- WOULD YOU BACK UP, PLEASE?

20:30.997 --> 20:33.533
YOU'RE RIGHT ON MY NECK HERE.
JUST BACK UP A LITTLE BIT.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.335
- YOU'RE BREATHING
DOWN MY NECK.
- SORRY, I'M--

20:35.435 --> 20:37.437
ANYWAY, I'M REALLY SORRY.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.639
ABOUT NOT KISSING YOU
IN THE RESTAURANT.
THAT WAS BAD.

20:39.739 --> 20:43.276
BUT JEFF TOLD ME
THAT YOU GAVE LEWIS
A BLOWJOB IN THE CAR

20:43.376 --> 20:45.011
BEFORE YOU GOT
TO THE RESTAURANT,
SO THAT'S WHY--

20:45.111 --> 20:48.415
- WHAT?! JEFF SAID--
JEFF SAID WHAT?
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

20:48.515 --> 20:51.751
BLOWJOB? WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.853
WHAT IS THIS? WHAT, AM I IN
GRADE THREE OR SOMETHING?

20:53.953 --> 20:55.855
LOOK, I HAVEN'T HAD A BLOWJOB
IN ABOUT FIVE YEARS,

20:55.955 --> 20:57.590
- SO I WAS EXCITED,
SO IT SLIPPED OUT.
- I KNOW! I CAN TELL!

20:57.690 --> 20:59.892
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE ONE FOR ANOTHER
FUCKING FIVE YEARS!

20:59.992 --> 21:01.561
( tires screech )

21:02.995 --> 21:04.831
WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, HUH?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.566
- WHAT? YOU TOLD ME
TO TELL THE TRUTH.
- ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY?

21:06.666 --> 21:07.967
- TELL THE TRUTH?
- YEAH.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.069
I THOUGHT THE TRUTH WAS
THAT YOU HAD A COLD SORE

21:10.169 --> 21:11.804
FOR CHRIST'S' SAKE!
THAT'S WHAT THE TRUTH
WOULD HAVE BEEN!

21:11.904 --> 21:13.806
WHAT? NO NO NO.
I MADE UP THE COLD SORE

21:13.906 --> 21:15.808
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO KISS HER! ANYWAY,
YOU WENT LIKE THIS!

21:15.908 --> 21:18.545
THAT'S THE SIGN FOR BLOWJOB.
THAT'S A BLOWJOB SIGN.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.580
- NO, IT'S COLD SORE.
IT'S "I'M CHOKING."
- THAT'S COLD SORE?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.415
THAT'S AN I'M-EATING-
CORN-ON-THE-COB THING.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.684
THAT'S A BLOWJOB, BUDDY,
WHERE I COME FROM. YEAH.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.119
WHY COULDN'T YOU
JUST KISS HER GOODBYE
LIKE A HUMAN BEING?

21:27.219 --> 21:29.589
KISS HER GOODBYE? SHE'S GOT
YOUR SEMEN ON HER LIPS.
I'M NOT GONNA KISS HER.

21:29.689 --> 21:32.525
- SHE HAD MY SEMEN ON HER LIPS.
- YES! YEAH, SECONDHAND SEMEN.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.461
YOU CAN'T BE
A HOMOSEXUAL BY PROXY.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.162
IT'S PROBABLY
IN THE FUCKING CONSTITUTION.

21:36.262 --> 21:37.830
I THINK YOU CAN
BE GAY BY PROXY.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.232
- CHRIST.
- ANYWAY, SORRY.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.934
HOW AM I GOING
TO GET HOME BY THE WAY?

21:42.034 --> 21:43.603
EH, YOU TAKE A BUS.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.810
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT
THIS LECTURE.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.712
- WHY?
- COME ON.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.214
HOW OFTEN DO
YOU GET TO LISTEN
TO SOMEBODY THIS SMART?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.717
NOT EVEN SMART, BRILLIANT.
SHE'S BRILLIANT.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.586
I GET IT.
YOU WERE IMPRESSED. OKAY?

21:59.686 --> 22:02.321
ENOUGH WITH
THE DR. TRUNDLE
AND THE BRILLIANCE.

22:02.422 --> 22:05.257
I GET
YOUR POINT, OKAY?

22:05.358 --> 22:08.260
HEY, DR. TRUNDLE'S HUSBAND.

22:08.361 --> 22:11.330
YEAH. I REMEMBER HIM
FROM THE PICTURE.

22:11.431 --> 22:14.266
YEAH, RIGHT.
YEAH, I SAW HIM YESTERDAY
IN THE RECEPTION AREA.

22:14.367 --> 22:17.203
- REALLY?
- YEAH. HE'S PROBABLY
ON HIS WAY TO THE LECTURE.

22:17.303 --> 22:18.638
YEAH.

22:20.206 --> 22:21.941
IS THAT DR. TRUNDLE?!

22:22.041 --> 22:24.110
GO-- IT--

22:24.210 --> 22:25.912
L.D., IS SHE GIVING
HIM A BLOWJOB?!

22:26.012 --> 22:28.481
- THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
- OH MY GOSH!

22:28.581 --> 22:30.617
- WOW.
- Loretta: OH NO.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.352
OH, NO NO NO NO
NO NO NO NO NO, L.D.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.187
- I WANT YOU TO TURN
THIS CAR AROUND.
- WHAT?

22:35.287 --> 22:37.256
- TURN THE CAR AROUND!
- SO WHAT? SO SHE'S GIVING
HIM A BLOWJOB.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.659
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
- NO NO NO! I CAN'T TRUST
A WOMAN LIKE THAT

22:39.759 --> 22:42.595
TO CURE MY CANCER,
DOING SOMETHING LIKE
THAT IN THE CAR!

22:42.695 --> 22:45.732
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- SHE MUST'VE BEEN DOING IT
FOR THERAPEUTIC REASONS.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.234
- I WANT YOU
TO TAKE ME HOME, L.D.
- THE LECTURE!

22:48.334 --> 22:51.738
L.D., TURN THIS CAR AROUND.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.482
- HI.
- HI.

23:02.582 --> 23:05.852
COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE
THIS TO DEAN WEINSTOCK?
HE'S A PATIENT HERE.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.121
- SURE. OKAY.
- IT'S A CHECK
FOR HIS GLASSES.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.357
- MR. DAVID.
- HELLO.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.325
HI, WHAT A SURPRISE.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.928
- YOU HERE ALONE?
- YEAH.

23:16.028 --> 23:20.800
I WOULD LOVE
TO TALK TO YOU.
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

23:20.900 --> 23:23.436
- SURE.
- GREAT. WE'LL GO
BACK TO MY OFFICE.

23:23.536 --> 23:26.072
- MELISSA, WOULD YOU HOLD
ALL THE CALLS, PLEASE?
- SURE, DR. TRUNDLE.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.774
THIS WAY.

23:29.509 --> 23:30.810
COME ON IN.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.614
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
HOW DISAPPOINTED I WAS

23:34.714 --> 23:37.917
THAT YOU AND LORETTA WERE NOT
AT THE LECTURE YESTERDAY.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.720
AND I THINK THE REASON
THAT YOU WEREN'T THERE

23:40.820 --> 23:42.855
WAS BECAUSE YOU RECOGNIZED

23:42.955 --> 23:46.058
THAT I AM GOING
TO RECOMMEND THAT SHE LEAVE
THE RELATIONSHIP.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.827
THAT TERRIFIES YOU
AND THAT'S WHY

23:47.927 --> 23:49.496
YOU DIDN'T WANT
HER TO BE THERE.

23:49.596 --> 23:52.532
NO NO, THAT'S THE FURTHEST
THING FROM THE TRUTH.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.667
I HAVE A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS,

23:54.767 --> 23:57.470
AND I FIND THAT MEN
OFTEN HAVE THIS REACTION.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.171
IT'S CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDABLE.
IT'S VERY THREATENING.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.008
BUT THE FACT IS
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A WOMAN'S LIFE

24:02.108 --> 24:05.512
AND I'M SAYING
SOMETHING THAT YOU
JUST DON'T WANT TO HEAR.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.247
IT'S NOT TRUE.
I REJECT YOUR HYPOTHESIS.

24:08.347 --> 24:09.749
WHY DIDN'T SHE COME
TO THE LECTURE?

24:09.849 --> 24:12.118
- YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW WHY?
- OF COURSE I DO.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.621
OKAY, I'M GOING
TO TELL YOU.

24:14.721 --> 24:18.525
WE WERE DRIVING
TO THE LECTURE,
WE WERE ON OUR WAY...

24:18.625 --> 24:20.660
- MM-HMM.
- ...AND THEN

24:20.760 --> 24:23.530
I NOTICED YOUR HUSBAND
IN THE CAR AHEAD OF US.

24:23.630 --> 24:27.734
THEN YOU PICKED
YOUR HEAD UP OFF OF HIS LAP

24:27.834 --> 24:32.338
AND LORETTA DECIDED
THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT
ANYTHING TO DO

24:32.438 --> 24:35.107
WITH A DOCTOR WHO WOULD,
YOU KNOW, DO THAT.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.909
WHO WOULD DO WHAT?

24:37.009 --> 24:38.911
COME ON.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.280
OH MY GOD.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.082
MY HUSBAND WAS
DRIVING THE CAR,

24:43.182 --> 24:45.918
AND YES,
I DROPPED MY CELL PHONE
ON HIS SIDE OF THE CAR,

24:46.018 --> 24:47.687
AND I WAS LOOKING
FOR THE CELL PHONE.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.689
AN AWFUL LONG TIME
TO LOOK FOR THE CELL PHONE.

24:49.789 --> 24:53.125
YOU ARE SO RIDICULOUS.
YOU ARE SO JUVENILE.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.794
- I DON'T KNOW.
- YOU ARE EXACTLY
THE KIND OF MAN

24:54.894 --> 24:57.063
- I'M TALKING ABOUT
IN THIS BOOK.
- ME?!

24:57.163 --> 24:58.397
YES. YOU ARE A TINY,

24:58.497 --> 25:01.300
LITTLE, INSECURE,
INFANTILE MIND

25:01.400 --> 25:03.035
OF ABOUT
A 12-YEAR-OLD!

25:03.135 --> 25:05.605
- I THINK YOU BLEW HIM.
- OH MY GOD!

25:05.705 --> 25:07.640
- YOU THINK I BLEW HIM?
- ( yelling )

25:07.740 --> 25:10.743
YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER
IN YOUR MIND THAN THAT?!

25:10.843 --> 25:13.512
YOU'RE OUT OF CONTROL!
GET HIM OUT OF MY OFFICE!

25:25.257 --> 25:26.559
OH SHIT.
OH SHIT.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.695
- MY SHOES ARE IN THERE.
- ALTON'S HERE!

25:28.795 --> 25:31.931
- WHAT?
- ALTON'S AT THE FRONT DOOR!

25:32.031 --> 25:35.702
YOU BROUGHT
HIS WIFE HERE?
YOU IDIOT!

25:38.070 --> 25:39.839
- I KNOW, MAN.
I'M SORRY.
- YOU SEE?

25:39.939 --> 25:42.441
- I'M SORRY.
- NOTHING, RIGHT?
SHE'S NOT HERE. SEE?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.977
I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T MEAN
TO RUN UP ALL IN HERE

25:45.077 --> 25:47.446
YEAH, YOU COME UP HERE,
RUSHING UP HERE TO
A WHITE MAN'S HOUSE--

25:47.546 --> 25:50.249
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
JUST FORGIVE ME.

25:50.349 --> 25:51.884
- I'M--
- ALL RIGHT, BROTHER.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.520
- BOY! SHIT.
- I'LL SEE YOU
NEXT WEEK THOUGH, OKAY?

25:54.621 --> 25:56.623
- ALL RIGHT.
- I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.397
( sighs )
IT'S OKAY. HE'S GONE.

26:05.497 --> 26:07.834
( sighs )
THANK GOD.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.802
( sighs )

26:10.770 --> 26:13.773
( gasps )
WHAT THE HELL?!

26:17.176 --> 26:19.145
OKAY. NOW COME ON.
GET IN THE CAR.
GET IN THE CAR.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.380
WE GETTING THE HELL
OUT OF HERE AND WE AIN'T
NEVER COMING BACK.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.083
YOU GOT ME TWISTED,
L.D., OKAY?

26:24.183 --> 26:26.052
GIVE YOUR ASS A LITTLE BIT
OF A TASTE OF CHOCOLATE,

26:26.152 --> 26:27.553
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU CHEATING ON ME?!

26:27.654 --> 26:29.321
THAT'S RIGHT.
I SAW YOUR ASS,

26:29.421 --> 26:33.125
YOU CHEATING,
NO-GOOD, BALD-HEADED
MOTHERFUCKER! I'M OUT!

26:34.727 --> 26:37.930
FUCK YOU, LARRY DAVID!
THAT'S SOME BULLSHIT!

26:41.868 --> 26:43.703
SOMEBODY GOT ON YOUR ASS.
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:43.803 --> 26:46.605
THEY'RE GONE.
WE HAD A BIG FIGHT.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.675
THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.476
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.879
- HUH.
- HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

26:52.979 --> 26:54.981
THAT'S SOME SHIT
RIGHT THERE. MMM.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.316
SO, UM...

26:57.416 --> 26:59.618
I GUESS THIS MEANS
YOU'LL BE...

26:59.719 --> 27:03.155
GOING UPSTAIRS,
EAT THIS FUCKING
CHINESE FOOD...

27:03.255 --> 27:05.157
IN MY FUCKING ROOM.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.803
HEY, LEWIS, IT'S ME.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.437
I'M ON MY WAY
TO MICHAEL YORK'S.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.139
MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.641
OTHERWISE, I'LL TALK
TO YOU TOMORROW.

27:22.742 --> 27:25.144
OKAY, BYE.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.014
HOLY SHIT.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.851
OH MY GOD.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.286
( radiator hissing )

27:38.324 --> 27:39.759
- JEFF?!
- ( yells )

27:39.859 --> 27:41.260
- JESUS CHRIST!
- LARRY!

27:41.360 --> 27:42.594
- WHAT THE HELL?
- WHOA!

27:42.695 --> 27:44.263
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
- ( yells )

27:44.363 --> 27:46.132
- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
- OY, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

27:46.232 --> 27:48.735
- WHAT THE-- JEEZ!
- ALL RIGHT! ENOUGH!

27:48.835 --> 27:50.069
SHE WAS GIVING YOU
A BLOWJOB?!

27:50.169 --> 27:51.570
OKAY, YEAH,
WE KNOW WHAT IT IS.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.872
- JESUS CHRIST!
- ALL RIGHT, STOP IT!

27:52.972 --> 27:54.841
- LARRY...
- I'M STUCK. I'M STUCK.

27:54.941 --> 27:56.308
- I CAN'T GET
THE SEAT BELT OFF.
- ...CAN YOU HELP US?

27:56.408 --> 27:58.745
- I BOUGHT AN X-ACTO KNIFE!
- AN X-ACTO KNIFE!

27:58.845 --> 28:00.146
- IT'S IN THE CAR!
- GO GET IT! GO GET IT!

28:00.246 --> 28:02.314
- GREAT! GO GET IT! YEAH!

28:02.414 --> 28:05.417
- Susie: HURRY!
