00:02.000 --> 00:04.160
Last time I came here you implied
that Edward might have been

00:04.160 --> 00:05.600
responsible for Emma's death.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.520
You make me feel like nothing bad
will ever happen again.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.120
Can you really tell me you
feel safe?

00:12.120 --> 00:15.360
I needed you here and you're not
here. You're never here.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.400
You agreed to live here under
certain rules!

00:17.400 --> 00:21.800
I can barely say the words out loud.
A baby.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.640
What are you going to tell Edward?

00:23.640 --> 00:26.920
Have you ever had the sense of him
controlling you?

00:26.920 --> 00:30.120
No. No, no, no, no, not today.

00:30.120 --> 00:34.080
You implied her death might
have been suspicious?

00:34.080 --> 00:35.160
He killed her.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.400
When a man is challenged,
he may become threatened.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.080
Were you and her in a relationship?

01:04.680 --> 01:05.880
ZIP SCRATCHES

01:08.840 --> 01:11.520
SHE PANTS

01:20.560 --> 01:23.040
SHE MOANS SOFTLY

01:28.960 --> 01:32.520
SHE VOMITS AND SPLUTTERS

01:36.000 --> 01:37.600
SHE COUGHS

01:40.200 --> 01:42.360
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

01:46.600 --> 01:48.120
Oh...

03:08.080 --> 03:09.680
So what I'm wondering is,

03:09.680 --> 03:13.040
could that pearl have come from
that necklace?

03:13.040 --> 03:14.080
Definitely.

03:15.680 --> 03:20.200
Presumably you broke it at some
point and had the pearls restrung?

03:20.200 --> 03:23.640
That's the strange thing,
I've never broken it.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.520
Well, the pearls are identical,

03:27.520 --> 03:29.800
Japanese triple A naturals.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.560
Someone must like you very much.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.640
I'm surprised it broke though.

03:35.640 --> 03:36.960
That's silk thread.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.760
Must've taken quite a bit of force.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.520
Right.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.120
Simon?

03:47.120 --> 03:49.840
Look, this is going to seem like
a very odd question,

03:49.840 --> 03:52.880
but did Edward Monkford every give
Emma any jewellery?

04:04.200 --> 04:07.440
That bitch Leona has just complained
to HR about Saul.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.280
Why? We've been trying
to patch things up,

04:09.280 --> 04:10.720
so he finished with her

04:10.720 --> 04:13.920
and, um, now she's trying
to get him fired.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.680
Oh, Mand.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.240
Maybe Leona was right
to say something.

04:18.240 --> 04:22.160
I mean, it's not just her,
he hits on loads of women.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.600
He could lose his job.Yeah, OK,

04:23.600 --> 04:26.520
but what if she was just telling
the truth?

04:26.520 --> 04:30.560
Babe, you can't want to be married
to a man that does that to you?

04:30.560 --> 04:32.960
So you're going to lecture me about
relationships now, are you?

04:32.960 --> 04:35.200
Someone who's not kept a boyfriend
more than five minutes.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.720
TOILET FLUSHES

04:38.160 --> 04:39.640
Why...why don't we go for a drink?

04:39.640 --> 04:41.120
I don't want to talk to you.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.960
I just needed you to be a bit
more fucking loyal.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.320
I need to speak to you, Edward.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.840
Will you PLEASE answer the phone?

05:25.520 --> 05:27.000
It's definitely hers.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.440
I saw her wearing it.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.400
He gave me a dead woman's necklace.

05:35.880 --> 05:39.520
And the jeweller said it was broken
with some force?

05:39.520 --> 05:41.120
Ripped off her neck maybe.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.560
We don't know that.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.880
Look, this may sound extreme,

05:47.880 --> 05:50.640
but you know how serial killers
repeat themselves.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.800
Every time they kill it's
the same MO,

05:52.800 --> 05:54.840
the same bizarre rituals?

05:55.920 --> 05:59.840
What if he keeps using that house
to lure women in?

05:59.840 --> 06:02.200
What if that's his ritual?

06:02.200 --> 06:05.360
You're right, Simon,
that does sound extreme.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.720
Although Emma's therapist
did mention this thing

06:10.720 --> 06:14.360
Edward might have,
repetition compulsion she called it,

06:14.360 --> 06:17.520
patterns, doing things over
and over.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.720
That's not that dissimilar, right?

06:23.160 --> 06:25.240
And his wife and child are buried
there, so...

06:27.360 --> 06:30.240
At Folgate Street? Emma found out.

06:31.320 --> 06:34.840
Buried in the same place
as where they died.My God.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.680
He never even mentioned that.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.720
Maybe it all started with Elizabeth.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.800
Which means that you
need to be careful.

06:44.800 --> 06:48.240
If it is a pattern,
it may not be over.

You came!

07:07.920 --> 07:10.840
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

07:10.840 --> 07:13.000
I wanted to do this in person.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.040
We are not good for each other.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.440
I can't be like this.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.800
You can't break up with me
because I played a stupid joke

07:23.800 --> 07:25.280
about my friend's tattoo.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.960
That's not why. It's everything.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.360
The drama, the chaos, your texts.

07:32.360 --> 07:35.240
That paint, I mean, what the hell
is that about?

07:35.240 --> 07:37.000
What have you been doing here?
That's not my fault.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.480
Then whose fault, is it?

07:39.480 --> 07:41.040
It's really complicated.
Yes, exactly.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.960
Everything is with you,

07:42.960 --> 07:47.360
complicated, unnecessary,
messy, cluttered.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.800
I never should have...
Never should have what?

07:52.800 --> 07:55.800
Never should have screwed me?
Oh, Emma.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.400
Because you seemed pretty into it at
the time? Yes.Mm.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.320
I was.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.320
I was.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.680
So come on, loosen up. No, no.

08:09.440 --> 08:13.680
For as long as it was perfect,
that was the agreement.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.440
We have these rules for a reason.

08:15.440 --> 08:19.200
They are there to help us do

08:19.200 --> 08:22.760
the right thing even when it's hard.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.080
You're going to need to find
somewhere else to live.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.920
No, you can't do that.

08:28.920 --> 08:34.160
Yes, I can. This house has rules too
and you've broken every single one.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.000
I thought...

08:36.000 --> 08:38.120
I thought you were going to be
someone else.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.480
I was wrong.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.560
Be out by the end of the week.

Fuck you, house!

09:48.520 --> 09:50.280
DISTANT CHUCKLING

09:56.800 --> 10:00.280
Paul Ellis. Thanks for meeting me
at such short notice. Yeah.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.720
I saw you at Edward's office.
You were arguing?

10:02.720 --> 10:04.840
Don't worry.
I'm not likely to have forgotten.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.240
You, uh, look like someone
I used to know.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.720
I know. That's why I'm here.

10:13.120 --> 10:16.000
Is that what you were arguing
about, Elizabeth?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.480
I can't tell you.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.720
I signed a non-disclosure agreement
when I left.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.760
I promise it won't go any further.

10:22.880 --> 10:26.040
I know it happened when
Folgate Street was still

10:26.040 --> 10:27.560
a building site.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.360
It must have been an awful time.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.840
You make it sound like an accident.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.120
It wasn't?

10:35.120 --> 10:38.160
Not entirely. He killed them.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.920
What do you mean, killed them?

10:41.680 --> 10:43.840
The three of them were visiting
the site one day

10:43.840 --> 10:45.520
to check on progress.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.760
He got angry at the position
of a wall,

10:47.760 --> 10:49.440
decided it was a few centimetres out

10:49.440 --> 10:52.640
and he knocked it down by reversing
a digger into it.

10:52.640 --> 10:57.040
Elizabeth and Max were standing
on the other side.Oh, my God.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.320
But he couldn't have known that.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.400
A few nights before he found her
crying on my shoulder.

11:06.520 --> 11:10.040
I think he suspected she was
going to leave him.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.840
But burying them there?

11:12.840 --> 11:17.600
Why would he do that unless he felt
a terrible guilt?

11:17.600 --> 11:20.480
Edward doesn't do guilt or remorse.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.480
All he cares about is getting his
own way and that house.

11:24.680 --> 11:28.440
I say house, but a more accurate
word might be tomb.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.320
Enjoy your day.

If you don't leave me alone,
I swear to God you'll regret it.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.800
I'm facing early retirement
because of you.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.240

15:23.720 --> 15:25.360
What the hell is this?

15:27.480 --> 15:28.640
It's about Emma.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.240
I'm trying to work out how she died,
who killed her.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.120
And you think I could've done it?

15:39.120 --> 15:41.880
It wasn't an accident.
I'm certain of that.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.480
The more people I talk to,

15:45.480 --> 15:49.400
the more one name keeps coming up
again and again,

15:49.400 --> 15:51.480
and I need to know what that man is
capable of.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.440
I'm falling in love with you...

15:58.480 --> 16:00.440
..and you're investigating me.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.480
I know you killed Elizabeth and Max,

16:06.480 --> 16:10.680
and I can't begin to imagine
the grief

16:10.680 --> 16:15.240
and guilt you must have felt,
but I need to.

16:16.960 --> 16:23.360
I need to understand how this
relates to me and to Emma.

16:23.360 --> 16:27.600
You of all people must know
what it feels like

16:27.600 --> 16:31.840
to feel responsible for the death
of someone you love,

16:31.840 --> 16:34.320
or am I wrong about that, too?

16:34.320 --> 16:38.480
Have I just totally misunderstood
you all along?

16:38.480 --> 16:39.880
Why are you doing this?

16:42.320 --> 16:43.720
Because I'm pregnant.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.480
No, you're not.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.320
You can't be.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.560
You can't be.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.520
Not again.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.560
You can't keep changing things
like this!

17:02.560 --> 17:06.400
I haven't decided yet whether
to keep it or not.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.560
A child. For us. Of all people!

17:08.560 --> 17:11.120
I know it wouldn't be easy. Easy?

17:11.120 --> 17:13.400
After what happened to you. To me!

17:13.400 --> 17:16.600
I'm sorry you feel this way but if
you won't tell me the truth

17:16.600 --> 17:18.120
about what really happened to Emma.

17:18.120 --> 17:21.400
Do you know why I accepted you
living here?

17:21.400 --> 17:26.720
You said you've designed a house
with integrity

17:26.720 --> 17:30.880
and I will strive to live there
with integrity.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.360
And now this?

17:34.360 --> 17:37.240
You're lecturing me about integrity?

17:39.160 --> 17:43.120
You knew all of this

17:43.120 --> 17:45.120
and you said nothing.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.640
Yes. Because I was trying
to protect you!

17:48.640 --> 17:52.480
I knew you'd become obsessed
with her because I had been.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.000
It was like an illness.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.720
I hated myself but I just
couldn't stop.

18:00.720 --> 18:01.920
And now you.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.000
Uh!

18:10.400 --> 18:12.000
How, could you?

18:16.480 --> 18:18.240
Call me when you've made a decision.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.400
SHE EXHALES SOFTLY

18:32.400 --> 18:34.040
Thanks for coming.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.560
Don't be silly. I'll come any time.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.080
Jesus.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.720
We broke up.

18:57.640 --> 18:58.880
Me and Edward.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.120
And the house is...

19:04.120 --> 19:05.640
..it's like it's turning on me.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.920
Why did you break up?

19:09.920 --> 19:11.520
Because...

19:14.240 --> 19:15.920
Oh, it's such a long story.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.640
I've been all over the place
recently.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.880
Si, there's something we
need to talk about.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.000
Something I...

19:35.400 --> 19:37.400
..should have told you ages ago.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.680
He didn't actually say get rid
of it, but that's what he meant.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.960
And he knows I've been doing all
this behind his back now.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.680
Are you in danger?

19:50.760 --> 19:55.040
He said he was falling in love
with me. It felt so real.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.840
Or is he just manipulating you?

19:57.840 --> 19:59.960
I don't think so.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.880
But on the other hand,
everyone who's ever met him seems

20:06.880 --> 20:09.840
to think he's some kind of monster,
and let's face it,

20:09.840 --> 20:11.200
anyone who could build this place

20:11.200 --> 20:14.280
could probably do pretty much
anything they set their mind to.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.960
What do I do?

20:22.080 --> 20:23.240
It's about...

20:26.360 --> 20:29.320
..Saul. Saul?

20:34.160 --> 20:39.880
It was, uh, after that sales thing
in Brighton.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.560
SHE CLEARS THROAT

20:43.880 --> 20:46.920
We were drinking...

20:48.200 --> 20:50.640
..drunk, doing dares...

20:55.800 --> 20:57.560
..flirting.

20:57.560 --> 21:01.080
The bar closed at midnight, but...

21:03.320 --> 21:06.320
..he said he had more booze
in his room.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.400
I wasn't going to go up with him.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.680
I was going to go to sleep.

21:17.800 --> 21:22.560
He texted me that he had opened
the bottle.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.360
Was I coming?

21:26.640 --> 21:28.120
And I went.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.480
Like a fucking idiot, I went.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.680
We always flirted.
It's just what we did.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.840
And then suddenly he just
went at me.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.960
And I don't think I actually
said no, but that's because

22:01.960 --> 22:03.360
I couldn't say anything.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.520
He didn't have a knife...

22:16.840 --> 22:18.640
..but he was so strong...

22:20.520 --> 22:22.040
..and I was terrified.

22:31.520 --> 22:36.400
And then after he was like I agreed
to it or something, but I didn't.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.080
SHE RETCHES

22:49.080 --> 22:51.440
SHE COUGHS, SPLUTTERS

22:51.440 --> 22:53.520
PHONE BUZZES

22:53.520 --> 22:57.360
The next morning he, uh,
he texted me.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.480
No words...

23:03.800 --> 23:05.120
..just that video.

23:10.040 --> 23:14.600
I knew I should take it to
the police, that's why I kept it.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.440
I'd gone to his room,

23:17.440 --> 23:22.160
I'd flirted with him in front
of everyone.

23:24.360 --> 23:26.880
I couldn't tell you.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.200
I couldn't...

23:28.200 --> 23:30.720
I couldn't even look at you.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.920
You, Amanda, work.

23:34.920 --> 23:37.080
I couldn't face it.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.680
So when the police thought it was
the burglar, I...

23:47.240 --> 23:49.760
I didn't think it would go anywhere,
but it didn't.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.680
It just kept getter bigger
and bigger and bigger.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.760
Em, Em. Why didn't you tell me?

23:58.240 --> 24:01.960
It would have been tough, sure,
but we'd have got through it.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.640
Don't you see?

24:05.640 --> 24:06.800
We'd have worked it out.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.560
So you believe me?
Of course I believe you.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.840
Hey, come here.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.160
Saul's a bastard and I'm going
to...

24:19.160 --> 24:21.280
I'm going to tear him apart.No.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.800
No, I'm going to...

24:24.440 --> 24:27.400
I'm going to tell HR what he did
to me.

24:27.400 --> 24:32.080
There's already a complaint against
him so when I tell them this,

24:32.080 --> 24:34.080
he'll definitely lose his job.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.920
OK.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.240
If that's what you want.

24:45.440 --> 24:49.880
Listen, I'm not going to
spoil things

24:49.880 --> 24:52.600
by asking if I can move back in.

24:56.880 --> 25:00.280
But if you see anyone suspicious
round the house,

25:00.280 --> 25:04.480
anyone, that includes
Edward Monkford,

25:04.480 --> 25:05.920
you'll call me, yes?

25:08.320 --> 25:10.240
I'll come sleep on the sofa any
time.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.560
Thanks.

25:16.440 --> 25:17.880
Friends again?

25:19.840 --> 25:22.160
Yeah. Friends.

25:37.880 --> 25:42.160
I just keep thinking why?

25:42.160 --> 25:44.040
Why did it happen?

25:44.040 --> 25:47.920
No. Why I was such an idiot.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.720
I should have never...

25:53.360 --> 25:55.520
I've never met a rape survivor

25:55.520 --> 25:58.800
who didn't blame themselves
to some extent.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.520
"I drank too much."

26:01.520 --> 26:03.280
"I wore the wrong clothes."

26:03.280 --> 26:04.920
"I led him on."

26:04.920 --> 26:07.600
But drinking with someone is
not consent.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.840
Flirting is not consent.

26:10.840 --> 26:13.160
Fancying someone is not consent.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.600
Only consent is consent.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.600
And it can be withdrawn at any time.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.960
You have done nothing wrong.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.560
He is a rapist.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.000
I know that's meant to be true,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.600
but it's different when it happens
to you.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.680
I've messed everything up,
haven't I?

26:45.880 --> 26:46.960
No.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.600
You've survived.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.880
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

27:41.040 --> 27:42.400
LOCK CLUNKS

28:00.400 --> 28:03.360
Come on, then. I'll kill you!

28:03.360 --> 28:06.480
Think I'm fucking around?
I'll fucking kill you!

28:06.480 --> 28:08.320
Oh, my God.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.000
Simon? I was outside.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.520
What are you doing here?

28:13.520 --> 28:16.800
I was keeping watch, just in case.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.160
Wh-What happened? Uh...

28:18.160 --> 28:20.280
Oh, my God. Was that Ray Nelson?

28:20.280 --> 28:21.600
We should call the police.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.920
No. I don't want them involved.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.800
OK. Well at least let me stay.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.840
I can stay down here on the sofa,
in case he comes back.

28:28.840 --> 28:32.280
OK. Thank you.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.520
You're amazing.

28:51.880 --> 28:54.080
I'll call you, OK?

28:54.080 --> 28:57.000
Thanks, for everything.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.360
TYPING

30:46.840 --> 30:48.880
Jane? Jane, do you have, uh...

30:48.880 --> 30:50.720
To make the whole
town self-sustainable.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.640
How dare you?!

30:52.640 --> 30:53.920
What?

30:53.920 --> 30:55.440
I found the cameras.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.160
There was some sort of malfunction,
and they came up on my laptop.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.960
The bedroom for
Christ's sake, the shower!

30:59.960 --> 31:01.560
Would you give us a moment, Peter?

31:01.560 --> 31:04.520
Let me know when you're done.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.760
No-one can access those cameras.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.760
It's face recognition software, so
the house can track your movements.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.560
They're not even
connected to the internet

31:11.560 --> 31:13.240
precisely to ensure your privacy.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.160
You said it was nothing
Facebook wouldn't do.

31:15.160 --> 31:18.240
Yes. Facebook has had
facial recognition for years.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.520
And Emma?

31:20.880 --> 31:24.400
If there were cameras, microphones,

31:24.400 --> 31:26.960
there'd be something from
the night she died, right?

31:26.960 --> 31:29.720
Unfortunately the house
systems had an outage that day.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.400
SHE SCOFFS

31:29.720 --> 31:31.400
An outage, that didn't

31:31.400 --> 31:32.600
strike you as suspicious?

31:32.600 --> 31:35.040
There was nothing to suggest
the two events were connected.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.560
Cos everyone wanted it to look
like an accident, didn't they?

31:37.560 --> 31:39.600
The police, the partnership,
it suited all of you

31:39.600 --> 31:41.000
not to have a murder on your hands,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.440
how convenient that that
weirdo happens to be your alibi.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.880
Jane, you are being irrational.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.880
I found a pearl.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.320
Oh, for God's sake.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.360
This necklace you gave me,

31:51.360 --> 31:53.600
you originally gave
it to her, didn't you?

31:53.600 --> 31:55.080
And then when it broke,

31:55.080 --> 31:59.120
you mysteriously got it
back and had it restrung.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.920
But you missed one. Jane...

32:02.920 --> 32:04.520
Don't "Jane" me!

32:04.520 --> 32:06.480
There were two necklaces.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.240
As you know, I'm
very particular about

32:08.240 --> 32:10.000
the objects I allow into my life.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.240
When I've made a choice,
I tend to stick to it.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.200
And us?

32:16.200 --> 32:17.920
Your women?

32:17.920 --> 32:19.920
Are we just objects
too to be replicated

32:19.920 --> 32:22.160
and replaced whenever we do
something you don't like?

32:22.160 --> 32:24.400
For the last fucking time, Jane,

32:24.400 --> 32:29.080
I had nothing whatsoever to
do with Emma Matthews' death.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.880
I wish I could believe you.

33:00.080 --> 33:03.720
Hi, it's Jane. Um,
do you have any time later?

33:04.760 --> 33:06.600
There's something I need help with.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.680
Thanks for coming.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.760
These are for you.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.360
Oh, wow.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.120
I always felt bad
about being so rude

33:16.120 --> 33:18.360
the first time we met.

33:18.360 --> 33:22.920
And you didn't say if you had any
food, but I brought some anyway.

33:22.920 --> 33:24.640
Thank you.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.400
Shall we? Mm.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.800
One of the inputs to the server was
marked "cameras". I've disabled it.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.840
Thank you.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.200
Makes you think, though.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.760
That outage would've had to
have been caused by someone

33:43.760 --> 33:46.960
who knew where the
service cupboard was.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.800
That pretty much
rules out Ray Nelson.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.520
But what about Edward's
partner, Peter Creed?

33:52.520 --> 33:55.720
There's definitely
something weird about him.

33:55.720 --> 33:57.280
My God, what if it was both of
them?

33:57.280 --> 34:00.760
Look, this may or
may not be relevant,

34:00.760 --> 34:03.520
but when Monkford told Emma about
his family being buried here,

34:03.520 --> 34:05.880
he used a Japanese word,

34:05.880 --> 34:07.800
"hitobashira".

34:07.800 --> 34:09.680
He said it was a good luck thing,

34:09.680 --> 34:12.760
but after you called,
I looked it up.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.320
Turns out it was
a bit more than that.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.320
It was making a
sacrifice to a building

34:17.320 --> 34:19.560
so that it would last 1,000 years.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.000
Jesus.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.720
For Monkford,
it's all about this house.

34:39.640 --> 34:40.800
PHONE VIBRATES

35:00.880 --> 35:03.640
Can we talk about
something else now?

35:03.640 --> 35:07.280
Something that isn't about
death, murder and burials?

35:07.280 --> 35:08.600
Of course.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.240
Is there anything I can do?

35:13.240 --> 35:14.880
Wine?

35:14.880 --> 35:17.280
I'm not drinking, but there's
Pinot Grigio in the fridge.

35:17.280 --> 35:18.760
I'll get it.

35:18.760 --> 35:22.240
Pinot Grigio was
Emma's favourite too.

35:22.240 --> 35:24.320
I used to tease her about it.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.640
White wine with steak?

35:25.640 --> 35:27.360
Lots of people prefer white.

35:31.560 --> 35:36.760
You know, it feels weirdly
familiar being here, opening wine.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.760
Oh, I said I wouldn't have any.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.760
I was going to put water in yours,

35:43.760 --> 35:45.200
so you can keep me company.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.280
Are you pregnant?

35:51.280 --> 35:54.400
That's very personal.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.480
It's Monkford's I take it?

36:04.200 --> 36:05.600
Sorry. None of my business.

36:09.800 --> 36:13.240
We're not together,
if that's what you're wondering.

36:19.960 --> 36:22.240
I wanted a family with Emma.

36:22.240 --> 36:26.280
I was going to propose to her,
after we got back together.

36:33.440 --> 36:38.200
I wanted to do the
most amazing proposal ever,

36:38.200 --> 36:41.360
like those viral videos
where the guy gets a choir

36:41.360 --> 36:44.840
to sing the girl's favourite song
in a tube carriage or something.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.760
She would've definitely had said yes
with all those people watching.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.040
What are you doing here?

37:10.440 --> 37:13.120
You look nice, Em.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.200
Were you going to ask me out?

37:15.200 --> 37:17.400
How did you get in?

37:17.400 --> 37:22.080
Before I moved out I told
the agent I lost my wristband,

37:22.080 --> 37:23.720
so he gave me a spare.

37:26.360 --> 37:29.440
Well, you can't stay,
I'm expecting someone.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.320
Anyone I know?

37:33.320 --> 37:36.520
No, just someone I met online.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.480
Right.

37:38.480 --> 37:39.640
Nice.

37:41.680 --> 37:45.240
Edward Monkford
will be disappointed.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.800
What do you mean?

37:46.800 --> 37:48.840
Not that he's really coming.

37:50.320 --> 37:53.760
I changed his contact
details in your phone,

37:53.760 --> 37:57.800
so when I text you from
this, you think it's him.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.960
Hello, trouble.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.320
When did you have my phone?

38:03.320 --> 38:05.200
A few nights ago.

38:05.200 --> 38:08.680
I've been sleeping in
the service cupboard.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.920
To protect you.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.280
How about you?

38:13.680 --> 38:15.240
Me what?

38:17.320 --> 38:20.560
I mean what sort of person
would tick your boxes?

38:26.720 --> 38:27.760
Um...

38:29.760 --> 38:32.680
..I'm not looking
for a relationship,

38:32.680 --> 38:36.600
at least not for the
foreseeable future anyway.

38:36.600 --> 38:40.480
If I was, any woman would
be lucky to have you?

38:40.480 --> 38:43.080
HE CHUCKLES

38:40.480 --> 38:43.080
Oh, no, you've, um...

38:43.080 --> 38:44.960
..you've got the
wrong end of the stick.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.560
I'm already seeing someone.Oh.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.320
It's the, uh, the first
person since Emma, actually.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.680
Her death must've
been awful for you.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.240
I know about the rape.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.680
I'm sorry.

39:07.680 --> 39:08.840
Saul.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.320
It's partly why she
wanted to live here.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.800
And she thought this
place would change her.

39:20.920 --> 39:25.720
The funny thing is,
it didn't, not really.

39:28.560 --> 39:33.800
However much she tried, she was
exactly the same old Em.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.400
But me...

39:36.400 --> 39:40.400
..right from the start,
I felt different here.

39:40.400 --> 39:44.640
It's like Emma said
to Monkford at our interview,

39:44.640 --> 39:47.040
I wasn't going to let
some bullying bastard

39:47.040 --> 39:50.040
just walk all over me any more.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.440
I'm sure you were never a pushover.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.400
If Edward Monkford
said he wanted you back,

39:54.400 --> 39:57.760
you'd be happy to be in a
relationship then, wouldn't you?

39:57.760 --> 39:59.680
You wouldn't give him the brush off.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.720
Simon, I thought
we'd patched things up.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.720
We made friends again.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.680
Ugh.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.200
Friends, yeah.

40:09.880 --> 40:12.680
There's a big difference though,
isn't there,

40:12.680 --> 40:18.440
between friends and you know,
the other thing.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.960
The real thing, and
that's why I had to test you.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.120
Text you.

40:26.280 --> 40:29.080
All you had to do
was ignore him, Em.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.440
In my dreams, you'd
tell him to piss off,

40:33.440 --> 40:35.560
but, ignoring him would have done.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.000
Why?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.200
Why?

40:41.640 --> 40:43.360
Why?

40:43.360 --> 40:47.200
That's what I keep asking myself!

40:47.200 --> 40:50.080
Why Monkford? Why Saul?

40:50.080 --> 40:53.240
Why any of them when none of them
love you the way that I love you.

40:56.440 --> 41:00.040
And you love me, I know you do.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.760
Si... We were happy, Em.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.520
I'm not right for you, Si.

41:06.760 --> 41:09.240
You deserve someone nice.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.880
Stop saying that, you are.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.200
Just tell me how to fix this.

41:15.200 --> 41:18.240
There's nothing to fix.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.360
I want you to leave...please.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.040
No.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.680
I can't do it, Em.
You can't do what?

41:32.680 --> 41:35.680
I can't let you be that person
who wants him but not me.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.240
You're crazy.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.320
Where are you going?
I'm calling the police. What?

41:40.320 --> 41:42.120
At least Edward would
never be so insen...!

41:42.120 --> 41:43.440
SHE GASPS

41:43.440 --> 41:45.080
Where the fuck are you going?!

41:45.080 --> 41:46.720

43:09.600 --> 43:11.160
Let me in Jane.

43:14.280 --> 43:15.640
We can work this out.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.760
We've got through worse, right?

43:20.760 --> 43:24.200
Like the time you decided to screw
my best friend behind my back.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.560
I-I've got my work phone.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.000
I'm calling the police.

43:33.360 --> 43:36.720
Yes, 1 Folgate Street.

43:36.720 --> 43:39.240
There's a man threatening me.

43:39.240 --> 43:41.680
I haven't threatened anyone.

43:41.680 --> 43:44.200
Unless you count the graffiti.

43:46.120 --> 43:50.440
I thought if she was scared
she'd come back to me...

43:53.840 --> 43:57.640
..but she just took me for granted.

43:57.640 --> 43:59.880
Please hurry. It's very convincing.

44:02.040 --> 44:05.320
But then, you're a
good liar, aren't you?

44:07.480 --> 44:10.520
Just like every woman
I've ever fucking met!

44:10.520 --> 44:12.560
Ugh!

44:12.560 --> 44:15.720
Ugh! Open the door!

44:15.720 --> 44:17.480
Ugh!

44:17.480 --> 44:18.760
HE SCREAMS

44:21.440 --> 44:24.280
Doesn't bother me, Jane.

44:24.280 --> 44:27.040
I'm here all day.

44:54.240 --> 44:58.280
I fancied you from the
very first time we met.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.280
It was like meeting
Emma all over again.

45:03.440 --> 45:06.480
But you knew that, didn't you?

45:06.480 --> 45:09.040
They say a woman always knows,

45:09.040 --> 45:11.640
you just choose to ignore it,

45:11.640 --> 45:13.840
because, really...

45:15.120 --> 45:18.560
..you're the ones with all
the fucking power.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.400
Are you listening to me, Jane?

45:22.600 --> 45:24.600

There are two possible

One is what really happened,
and you acted in self-defence.

48:22.120 --> 48:24.760
And the other?

48:24.760 --> 48:27.120
He came here to kill
himself in the same spot

48:27.120 --> 48:29.400
where his beloved
Emma tripped and fell.

48:29.400 --> 48:31.240
You hid in the service cupboard,

48:31.240 --> 48:32.720
that's where you called me from.

48:32.720 --> 48:35.720
When I got here, we found him dead.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.560
You'd lie for me?

48:44.080 --> 48:45.920
If you tell the truth
about this, Jane,

48:45.920 --> 48:48.280
there will be an investigation,

48:48.280 --> 48:49.760
months of legal process,

48:49.760 --> 48:53.520
maybe even...a trial
for manslaughter.

49:01.240 --> 49:03.040
I was wrong about you.

49:05.240 --> 49:08.760
I should never have
suspected what I did.

49:08.760 --> 49:10.680
But you were right about Emma.

49:13.360 --> 49:15.320
You've been good to her.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.440
And that's why I want
to tell the truth,

49:23.440 --> 49:26.080
in court if necessary,

49:26.080 --> 49:29.360
about Saul, Simon, all of this.

49:33.400 --> 49:37.000
She deserves the world to
know what really happened.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.480
No more lies.

49:44.120 --> 49:45.480
OK.

49:50.400 --> 49:51.800
OK.

50:20.280 --> 50:21.440
Hello.

50:23.320 --> 50:24.360
Hi.

50:39.560 --> 50:43.400
Saul Cosby, I'm arresting you
for the rape of Emma Matthews.

50:45.600 --> 50:48.920
Whoa, whoa, are
you...are you fucking joking?

51:00.320 --> 51:01.680
Jane?

51:01.680 --> 51:03.480
It's time to go.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.200
We will have a child one day.

51:20.600 --> 51:22.200
A child that's planned.

51:53.720 --> 51:55.240
Jane Cavendish?

51:56.440 --> 51:58.400
Would you like to
come with me, please?

51:59.920 --> 52:01.480
I'll be right here.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.800
We think we know what we
need, don't we...

52:17.960 --> 52:22.400
..to fill the holes inside us.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.920
But we're wrong.

52:24.920 --> 52:26.840
Well, at least I was.

52:29.960 --> 52:35.720
I thought moving into that house
and getting rid of everything,

52:35.720 --> 52:38.560
everyone, would help.

52:40.560 --> 52:42.480
But at the end of the day,

52:42.480 --> 52:46.440
it doesn't matter how pretty or
empty your surroundings are,

52:46.440 --> 52:49.880
not if you're
messed up inside still.

52:49.880 --> 52:53.000
That's all anyone's looking
for, really, isn't it?

52:53.000 --> 52:56.320
Someone to help take care of
the mess inside our heads.

52:57.720 --> 52:59.920
Do you have a pen?

53:17.440 --> 53:20.920
The man waiting, could
you give him this for me?

53:20.920 --> 53:24.160
Of course.Maybe in
about half an hour.

53:24.160 --> 53:26.880
Oh, and this.

53:50.040 --> 53:52.000
"Dearest Edward,

53:52.000 --> 53:55.520
"I wanted you to know,
our child was planned.

53:56.640 --> 53:58.640
"I don't mean I meant
to get pregnant,

53:58.640 --> 54:01.160
"at least not consciously,

54:01.160 --> 54:04.120
"but I knew you were someone
I could have a child with,

54:04.120 --> 54:06.640
"who could be a good
father again one day.

54:06.640 --> 54:10.880
"And that's why I hope this will
be the wake-up call you need.

54:10.880 --> 54:13.760
"I'm giving you something, a name.

54:13.760 --> 54:16.960
"She helped Emma, and
she's been helping me,

54:16.960 --> 54:20.920
"and I think she'll help
you too, if you'll let her.

54:20.920 --> 54:24.280
"I think right now you're
trapped in the past,

54:24.280 --> 54:26.960
"and I can't let myself get
trapped in there with you.

54:26.960 --> 54:28.520

54:31.920 --> 54:34.240
Thank you for
welcoming me to the team.

54:34.240 --> 54:37.040
I want to bring some of the
techniques from my old job

54:37.040 --> 54:40.160
to what I'll be doing
here at Stillbirth Action.

54:40.160 --> 54:44.600
"Until then, I guess
this is goodbye."

54:44.600 --> 54:48.000
Not because of Emma in the end,

54:48.000 --> 54:51.400
but because of what I need,

54:51.400 --> 54:54.880
and because of the girl before,

54:54.880 --> 54:57.000
I mean a girl called Isabel.

55:20.240 --> 55:23.320
The owner was going to live here
himself at one stage I believe,

55:23.320 --> 55:27.360
but now he sets an
affordable rent to people

55:27.360 --> 55:29.560
who will live here
the way he intended.
