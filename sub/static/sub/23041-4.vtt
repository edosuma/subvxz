00:38.880 --> 00:40.920
-Coach.
-[device]  Yes, Frank?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.960
-Where do I go?
-[device]  Proceed to the hub.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.360
Got ya.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.600
[chattering]

01:27.240 --> 01:29.880
-How will I know who he is?
-[device]  This is him.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.360
-[Frank] Hi. Oh, oh.
-[cutlery clatters]

01:37.320 --> 01:39.400
Sorry. Fork.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.320
-Amy.
-No, no, my name's not fork.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.480
-I guessed. It was just--
-It's Frank.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.640
-Do you wanna sit? Shall we sit?
-I think it's that or stand. [laughs]

01:46.720 --> 01:47.920
[Frank] Come sit, yeah?

01:48.840 --> 01:51.520
Oh, oh! That's, um... I was on that side.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.920
-Oh. Shall I...?
-No, no, it doesn't matter.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.640
[Frank laughs]

01:56.080 --> 01:57.640
-[Frank] Why bring it up?
-[laughs]

01:59.240 --> 02:01.080
Sorry. I'm so bloody nervous.

02:01.160 --> 02:05.560
It's my first time on the,
you know, the system.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.680
-Me too.
-Oh, really?

02:07.760 --> 02:09.520
Yeah, I'm shitting it, mate.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.120
-Come to mention it, you look terrified.
-Do I?

02:12.200 --> 02:14.920
-Yeah, quaking with fear.
-Or maybe shaking with revulsion?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.160
At least you stopped... shitting.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.560
Oh! [laughs]

02:18.640 --> 02:20.720
-Are you sure about that?
-[both laugh]

02:23.040 --> 02:24.320
[Amy laughs]

02:24.400 --> 02:27.440
-Shall we stop talking about shitting?
-Maybe order some food? Good plan.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.400
Yeah. OK.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.240
-Do you know how we order?
-I think we use these.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.880
-Oh!
-[device]  Menu choice already established.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.200
-[Frank] Oh. Ta.
-[waiter] Here you are, sir.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.400
[waiter] And for you, madam.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.600
Well, evidently I'm a pasta girl.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.560
Yeah, I'm a, uh...

02:43.960 --> 02:45.960
-[cutlery clatters]
-...fishcake...

02:46.440 --> 02:47.800
[laughs]

02:51.520 --> 02:53.200
-[Amy] Hmm.
-[Frank] Mmm.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.200
-It's good.
-Can I try some?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.640
Are we... allowed to do that?

03:03.560 --> 03:04.800
Fuck it.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.720
-Yeah, fuck it.
-[Amy laughs]

03:08.680 --> 03:09.960
-Mm. That is good.
-Mm-hmm.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.760
So... we're both first-timers.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.760
[Frank] Hmm.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.560
-Shall we check our expiry date?
-Yeah, good plan.

03:23.640 --> 03:29.080
Yeah? All right, um,
so I think it's under "info."

03:29.760 --> 03:34.080
Yeah, uh, "tap to reveal."
We have to tap to reveal at the same time.

03:34.160 --> 03:39.240
-OK. So, on three, two, one. Go.
-[devices beep]

03:41.280 --> 03:43.960
-Twelve hours.
-Yeah, 12 hours.

03:45.480 --> 03:46.800
-OK.
-Bit, um...

03:46.880 --> 03:48.120
-Yeah.
-Bit short.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.960
-It is a bit short, isn't it?
-Hmm.

03:50.040 --> 03:53.000
Oh. And getting shorter.
I didn't realize it would...

03:53.080 --> 03:54.400
sort of count down like that.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.000
It's sort of sad.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.240
Maybe we should eat quickly.

03:59.160 --> 04:03.440
-Yeah. Yeah, maybe we should.
-The race is on.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.280
-Come on, hurry up.
-[laughs]

04:13.520 --> 04:14.800
[Frank] I guess this is us.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.839
And this takes us to the place?

04:16.920 --> 04:18.560
Yeah, suppose so.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.760
-After you.
-[Amy] Thank you. [laughs]

05:03.320 --> 05:04.720
[whispers] It's massive.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.920
-[Frank] Here we are.
-[Amy] Yep.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.080
[Amy] Huh.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.160
[vehicle drives away]

05:27.400 --> 05:29.920
-Do you wanna open it or shall I?
-You go ahead.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.160
-All right.
-Ha! Too slow.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.960
You're a knob. [laughs]

05:37.120 --> 05:38.200
[door opens]

05:40.920 --> 05:44.040
Oh, God. It's a shithole.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.600
-You're kidding.
-I am, yeah.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.600
[Amy chuckles]

05:49.360 --> 05:51.120
[lounge music plays]

05:51.200 --> 05:52.200
[Amy] Ooh!

05:55.280 --> 05:59.080
It's nice. I, uh, like that lamp.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.520
-Yeah, it's incredible, that lamp.
-[laughs] Fuck off.

06:15.840 --> 06:16.840
[Amy] Hmm.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.840
Right. That's, uh...

06:21.080 --> 06:21.920
[exhales]

06:26.000 --> 06:27.200
There's an en suite.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.640
-Shower or bath?
-Both.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.680
Ah. That's good.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.680
Uh. Well, I'm...
I'm just gonna use the loo.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.800
Yeah, I've got to, uh... over here, so...
[clears throat]

06:39.880 --> 06:40.840
Yeah.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.520
[Amy clears throat]

06:49.480 --> 06:51.480
OK, seriously, what are we meant to do?

06:51.560 --> 06:53.600
[device]  Query too broad. Please narrow.

06:53.680 --> 06:57.360
Well, I mean, are we just meant to...
I don't know, like, just go at it?

06:57.440 --> 06:59.760
-[device]  Define "go at it."
- [scoffs]

06:59.840 --> 07:00.960
Fucking hell.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.760
So, are we meant to just
have sex with each other?

07:04.840 --> 07:07.960
[device]  Participants are not required
to take any specific action.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.520
Yeah, but I mean we can, right?

07:11.040 --> 07:13.600
I mean, people do
if it's just a short time?

07:13.680 --> 07:15.240
[device]  If that's your decision.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.720
-It's up to us?
-[device]  It's up to you.

07:22.760 --> 07:23.640
[exhales]

07:25.400 --> 07:26.680
I could just sleep here.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.760
Don't be daft.
You'll be scrunched up in a ball.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.880
[groans]

07:37.720 --> 07:38.920
It's not awful.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.680
The bed's pretty big.
I'm sure we could both fit in it.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.960
Yeah, OK.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.880
Must have been mental before the system.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.560
How do you mean?

07:55.240 --> 07:59.720
Well, people had to do
the whole relationship thing themselves,

08:00.440 --> 08:01.960
work out who they wanna be with.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.880
Hmm. Option paralysis.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.840
So many choices, you end up
not knowing which one you want.

08:06.920 --> 08:11.800
Yeah, exactly, and if things seem shitty,

08:12.520 --> 08:15.440
they'd have to figure out whether
they wanted to break up with someone.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.440
How to break up with someone.
Fuckin' hell.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.160
-Just a nightmare.
-It's not like when it's all mapped out.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.880
God, no. It's so much simpler
when it's all mapped out.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.000
[Frank] Hmm.

08:29.320 --> 08:32.440
-This is weird, though.
-It really is. Hmm.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.480
[door opens and closes]

09:20.800 --> 09:23.920
-Well, then.
-So...

09:24.320 --> 09:26.840
Thanks for being my first.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.200
-[devices beep]
-[Frank] Oh. Yeah.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.960
-[device beeps]
-[Amy] Bloody time.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.200
It was great, you know. You were nice.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.080
-[devices beeping]
-So were you.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.920
If we had this time again,
you would totally get it, by the way.

09:45.160 --> 09:48.160
-Oh, you... You bastard.
-Sorry.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.600
-You'd get it, too.
-Fucked that one up, didn't we?

09:53.240 --> 09:54.840
-Yeah, totally.
-[both laugh]

09:56.360 --> 09:57.960
[devices chime]

10:19.960 --> 10:24.320
I guess I just don't see the point
in something that short. Twelve hours.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.440
[device]
Even your reaction to a brief encounter

10:26.520 --> 10:29.200
provides the system
with valuable information.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.680
[pants]

10:30.760 --> 10:34.360
Yeah, well, I didn't even do anything.
The system thinks I'm a prude.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.480
[device]  The system makes
no moral judgments.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.000
Yeah, but how do I know she wasn't
the perfect match for me? She was...

10:40.080 --> 10:42.880
[device]  Your ultimate compatible other
has not yet been selected.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.400
Yeah, I know, but it's--

10:44.480 --> 10:47.120
[device]  The system gains insight
as each participant progresses

10:47.200 --> 10:48.640
through numerous relationships

10:48.720 --> 10:52.680
and uses the gathered data to eventually
select an ultimate compatible other.

10:52.760 --> 10:56.280
On your pairing day, I know,
and it always finds your perfect match.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.840
[device]  In 99.8% of cases.

10:58.920 --> 11:02.120
But I have to go through
loads of relationships to find it.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.160
-[device]  That is correct.
-Great.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.680
-[strains]
-[stone skips four times]

11:07.760 --> 11:09.920
-[device chimes]
-What was that?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.760
-[device]  Another relationship.
-What, already?

11:12.840 --> 11:15.600
-[device chimes]
-[Frank] What's this, another one?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.320
[device]  That is correct.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.320
[sighs] I'd best go get changed, then.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.720
-[chattering]
-[music plays softly]

11:29.360 --> 11:31.480
Holy fuck. Tell me that's him.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.440
[device]  I cannot confirm identity
until a personal introduction is made.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.880
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:39.160 --> 11:42.160
-[device]  Identity confirmed.
-[man clears throat]

11:44.280 --> 11:46.200
-I like your hair.
-Yours is good too.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.960
-It's all my own.
-[Amy laughs]

11:52.840 --> 11:54.360
It's just funny.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.760
[Amy laughs]

12:02.400 --> 12:03.320
[Frank] Hi.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.240
I'm Frank.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.480
[woman] Hmm.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.200
Nicola. I've been here a while.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.760
Aye, sorry. I was getting changed.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.960
-Really?
-You started already?

12:18.040 --> 12:21.840
-I was hungry.
-Yeah, course, yeah. Sorry.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.800
Come on, let's get it over with.
Checking the expiry.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.520
Oh! Yeah, yeah.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.080
[devices beep]

12:39.960 --> 12:41.200
One year.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.720
We've got each other for one year?
Could be a mistake.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.360
-Coach, is this a mistake?
-[device]  This is not a mistake.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.200
Jesus fucking Christ.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.360
There'll be a reason.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.280
[Frank] Thanks.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.800
[clears throat]

13:03.200 --> 13:04.960
[cutlery scrapes on plate]

13:06.080 --> 13:09.360
Look on the bright side.
Chicken tikka masala.

13:10.120 --> 13:10.960
What?

13:12.320 --> 13:15.720
Chicken tikka mas-- It's a joke.

13:16.680 --> 13:20.240
Right. So you're the sort of person
that makes jokes.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.640
[puts cutlery down]

13:29.600 --> 13:32.000
-OK, so on three.
-Two, one.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.040
[devices beep]

13:34.120 --> 13:36.360
Oh. Interesting.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.600
Nine months.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.520
Well... cheers.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.480
Cheers.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.720
[exhales loudly]

13:56.160 --> 13:58.000
-[electronic sounds]
-[door opens]

14:01.160 --> 14:03.040
[soft jazz playing]

14:04.080 --> 14:06.200
Pretty much the same as my last one.

14:06.280 --> 14:10.840
-How many of these have you had?
-Relationships? So far? Five.

14:10.920 --> 14:13.240
-[Amy] Oh. [laughs]
-I'm an old hand, I suppose.

14:14.800 --> 14:15.880
[Amy clears throat]

14:17.160 --> 14:19.160
Listen, I'm just gonna jump in the shower.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.320
-OK.
-Won't be long.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.520
[Amy laughs]

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
[soft jazz continues]

14:47.400 --> 14:48.480
[man] Hey.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.120
Hi.

14:51.120 --> 14:54.480
[man] So, listen, if you're OK with it,
this is relationship five for me,

14:54.560 --> 14:57.200
and I've found it's best to have sex
straight away upfront.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.440
Right, yeah.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.800
Kind of breaks the ice, gives an early
overview of compatibility and so on.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.720
Yep. [laughs nervously]

15:05.800 --> 15:08.560
-So I'm consenting to everything now.
-[device beeps]

15:08.640 --> 15:10.440
Whenever you feel comfortable
doing the same--

15:10.520 --> 15:12.560
-[device chimes]
-[man clears throat]

15:14.040 --> 15:15.760
[panting]

15:19.120 --> 15:21.960
[moaning]

15:23.760 --> 15:25.720
[grunting]

15:28.120 --> 15:30.080
Tikka masala. Just...

15:30.560 --> 15:32.880
-[Frank] What?
-It's a bit tikka masala.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.600
-[Frank] Oh. I'm sorry.
-[Nicola] Talking makes it worse.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.600
[muffled] Sorry.

15:38.680 --> 15:41.400
No, no, you're gonna have to do it
from behind.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.280
-[Frank] You what?
-From behind.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.760
[moaning]

16:00.960 --> 16:02.000
Bit faster?

16:10.240 --> 16:11.560
More motion.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.000
Not like that. More motion.
You're all in out, in out,

16:15.080 --> 16:17.440
like you're trying to shut a drawer
into a filing cabinet.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.400
-[Frank] Sorry.
-It's just boring.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.120
Want a bit more side to side.

16:24.840 --> 16:25.680
Like this?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.520
No, not really.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.520
[exhales loudly]

16:38.960 --> 16:40.320
[mimics loud exhaling]

16:40.640 --> 16:41.600
-[chuckles]
-What was that?

16:43.160 --> 16:45.000
-Nothing.
-Hmm.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.520
[exhales loudly]

17:28.720 --> 17:30.040
Fucking hell.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.280
[Frank] So I can't just walk away?

17:33.360 --> 17:35.000
[device]  That is correct.

17:35.080 --> 17:38.120
One day it will provide you
with the ultimate match.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.880
One day. One day.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.400
[chattering]

18:27.240 --> 18:29.280
[woman] So I'd just like to say,

18:29.360 --> 18:33.240
do have faith in the system,
because it does deliver.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.560
-It did for us.
-[both laugh]

18:36.600 --> 18:38.160
[woman] You have so many experiences,

18:38.240 --> 18:41.720
and then one day it pairs you up
with your ultimate match,

18:41.800 --> 18:43.280
the best in show, as it were.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.520
-[imitates dog barking]

18:45.600 --> 18:46.600
Ha.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.120
So if you're having doubts,
just hang on in there.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.880
-Because it really does work.
-[laughs]

19:28.280 --> 19:30.680
-[Amy] Hi. Hi.
-Mm!

19:30.760 --> 19:32.880
-[mumbles]
-Was that, uh, your...?

19:33.400 --> 19:36.800
-Yeah. Nicola.
-Oh. Nicola.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.160
-[Frank] Hmm.
-Ha.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.040
-[coughing]
-[Amy] You OK?

19:42.240 --> 19:44.280
No, you're not being...?
Are you being serious?

19:44.360 --> 19:47.240
Oh, my God.
OK, this is happening. OK, um, just...

19:48.560 --> 19:49.840
[spits]

19:49.920 --> 19:52.040
[Frank] Oh. Thanks. [laughs]

19:52.120 --> 19:55.240

19:55.320 --> 19:56.600
-You look well.
-Thanks.

19:56.680 --> 20:01.600
I'd return the compliment, but you've just
spat food on my shoe, so...

20:01.680 --> 20:03.960
To be fair, it is a revolting shoe, so...

20:04.040 --> 20:05.680
All the better to kick you with.

20:05.760 --> 20:06.760
[gasps]

20:06.840 --> 20:09.240
[laughs] Was that really hard?

20:09.800 --> 20:12.680
-Ouch.
-I'm so sorry. [laughs] Fuck.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.960
[both laugh]

20:16.040 --> 20:17.640
-[Amy] Shit.
-[Frank clears throat]

20:18.160 --> 20:21.240
Oh. Oh! Um... Uh...

20:21.320 --> 20:23.680
Lenny, this is, um, Frank.
Frank, this is Lenny.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.600
-Hi, Lenny. You all right?
-Hi.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.320
We were together for a bit. [laughs]

20:28.400 --> 20:31.880
-A small... small bit.
-Yeah, just before we...

20:31.960 --> 20:34.920
So you two...? Oh. That's... that's great.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.920
So, I mean... it looks like you two
make a great team.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.120
[Lenny exhales loudly]

20:41.560 --> 20:43.960
Yeah. [laughs uncomfortably]

20:44.600 --> 20:46.960
[applause and cheering]

20:50.960 --> 20:52.360
-[Frank] Yeah.
-Um, I'll see you.

20:52.440 --> 20:53.280
Yeah.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.600

-What noise?

22:44.120 --> 22:45.200
[mimics Lenny exhaling]

22:46.360 --> 22:50.160
-Do I do that?
-Yeah, you do, quite often.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.760
Does it bother you?

22:52.920 --> 22:54.640
A bit, yeah.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.840
-I'll try not to.
-OK.

-But end it must.

24:01.680 --> 24:02.560
Anyway...

26:14.520 --> 26:16.480
-I just wanna say--
-Don't.

26:18.720 --> 26:22.120
Well, I learned what it's like to cohabit
with someone I despise.

26:22.200 --> 26:25.720
-Is that useful for the system?
-[device]  Everything happens for a reason.

-[music plays softly]

26:51.200 --> 26:54.000
-[laughs] Hello, you.
-Hi.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.160
[Amy] Hi.

26:55.760 --> 26:56.920
[Frank] Is this right?

26:57.240 --> 26:58.600
-[Amy] Yeah.
-[Frank] I mean...

26:58.680 --> 27:01.480
Yeah, I didn't think the system
would hook us up again.

27:01.560 --> 27:05.040
No, me neither. I mean,
I hope it's right, obviously, but...

27:05.120 --> 27:08.720
-Coach, are we sat at the right table?
-[device]  Yes, that is correct.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.000
[laughs] OK, well...

27:11.920 --> 27:14.840
Wait, um...
Can we not check the expiry date?

27:14.920 --> 27:17.280
-Uh... Why?
-Just sick of it.

27:17.600 --> 27:21.840
The system's just bounced me from bloke
to bloke, short fling after short fling.

27:21.920 --> 27:24.360
I know they're short flings,
they're just meaningless,

27:24.440 --> 27:27.160
and I get really detached.
It's like I'm not really there.

27:27.720 --> 27:31.560
So the other week, I was with this guy,
God knows who, basically just a haircut.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.560
And I literally had
this out-of-body experience.

27:34.640 --> 27:37.640
I wandered out of my body,
and I sat in this chair across the room

27:37.720 --> 27:41.200
and I watched myself fucking this guy.
And I was, like, what is that all about?

27:41.280 --> 27:44.280
That is literally just a dick
going in and out of a hole.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.720
-Yeah, that's pretty detached.
-[Amy laughs]

27:47.680 --> 27:50.000
When it's a long-term thing,
it's just as bad,

27:50.080 --> 27:53.560
watching the clock like you're a prisoner,
counting the hours, the minutes.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.240
-Oh, God, I've been there.
-Yeah.

27:57.600 --> 28:00.440
-Yeah, let's not check the expiry, then.
-Yeah.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.640
-It's a deal.
-Deal.

28:04.680 --> 28:08.200
-[Amy] OK.
-[Frank] Bring on  les  fishcake.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.800
-[laughs]
-[Frank] I don't know.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.360
[device chimes]

28:18.880 --> 28:21.600
-So?
-So...

28:23.200 --> 28:26.280
-Might as well.
-I suppose we have to.

28:26.360 --> 28:30.000
-Don't know how much time we've got.
-Yeah, it could be ten minutes.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.680
-Think you could last ten minutes?
-Fuck off.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.040
[laughter]

28:35.840 --> 28:37.920
All right. OK, then.

28:41.080 --> 28:44.680
Wait. One of us should
get undressed first.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.280
-Why only one of us?
-It'll be funny.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.680
-Go on then. Get your kit off.
-[laughs]

28:50.760 --> 28:52.920
No. No, it was my idea.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.040
[Frank laughs]

28:55.680 --> 28:57.040
All right.

28:57.560 --> 28:58.640
[belt buckle rattles]

29:00.680 --> 29:02.560
This is kind of emasculating.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.440
Well, then, you'd better
make up for it in a minute.

29:08.320 --> 29:11.120
-♪  I'm gonna see your dick ♪
-[laughs]

29:11.200 --> 29:12.840
[laughs] Sorry.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.960
-♪  I'm gonna fucking see it ♪
-Yeah, OK. Yeah--

29:52.360 --> 29:55.840
What if there is no scrutiny, it's just
putting us together in any old order,

29:55.920 --> 29:59.480
and we all go along with it 'cause they're
always telling us how clever it is?

29:59.560 --> 30:04.200
Yeah, but it does put people with the one.
It's got a 99.8% success rate.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.280
But how do you know
they're perfect matches?

30:06.600 --> 30:10.800
I mean, what if all it's actually doing
is gradually wearing us down,

30:10.880 --> 30:13.280
putting us in one relationship
after another

30:13.360 --> 30:15.840
for random durations
in a random sequence?

30:15.920 --> 30:19.760
Each time you get a little bit
more pliable, a little bit more broken,

30:19.840 --> 30:24.280
until eventually it coughs up the final
offering and says that's the one.

30:24.360 --> 30:28.480
And by that point
you are so defeated and so exhausted

30:28.560 --> 30:30.600
that you just accept it, you settle.

30:31.680 --> 30:35.440
And then you have to live
the rest of your life

30:35.520 --> 30:37.640
convincing yourself you didn't.

30:39.280 --> 30:42.360
Well done. That's one of
the bleakest things I've ever heard.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.160
[Amy laughs] Thank you.

30:46.760 --> 30:52.680
Right. Do you wanna know my theory?
Let's assume the system isn't random.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.000
-It's as sophisticated as they say it is.
-OK.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.160
Right, so using these,
it slurps up all your reactions, yeah?

30:58.240 --> 31:00.200
-It builds up a complex profile.
-Mm-hmm.

31:01.040 --> 31:05.680
Every crazy thought you've ever had, all
your dreams and your weaknesses and--

31:05.760 --> 31:08.440
-And your mad theories.
-Yeah, like, everything in your head.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.080
-Right.
-So if it's everything in your head...

31:11.600 --> 31:14.600
-does it have thoughts?
-All right, so now you're gonna say:

31:14.680 --> 31:17.960
[mimics his accent] "What if that's us
and we're stuck in a simulation?"

31:18.040 --> 31:19.560

-[Frank yelps]
-[Amy laughs]

31:22.920 --> 31:24.120

33:41.960 --> 33:45.920
The expiry date for me and Amy.
I need to know how long.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.920
You're not gonna talk me out of it?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.960
[device]  Would you like me
to talk you out of it?

33:54.040 --> 33:56.120
Yeah. Uh... No. I...

Don't know.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.800
[sniffles]

36:08.120 --> 36:09.440
[Amy giggles]

36:16.960 --> 36:18.080
You OK?

36:18.560 --> 36:19.880
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.680
-All right.
-[Frank] I'm good.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.560
Have you ever had more than four
or less than four?

36:51.280 --> 36:52.720
[Amy] What you thinking about?

36:54.800 --> 36:55.680
Nothing.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.120
[Amy exhales]

37:39.640 --> 37:41.360
All right, seriously, what's up?

37:47.280 --> 37:48.920
[inhales deeply]

37:51.200 --> 37:53.760
-[Frank] I looked.
-Looked at what?

37:59.400 --> 38:01.240
We promised we wouldn't. We shook on it.

38:01.920 --> 38:05.400
-Don't you wanna know what it said?
-No. That was the point.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.520
-It's almost done anyway.
-How almost done?

38:09.760 --> 38:10.840
We've got, like, an hour.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.880
-[sighs]
-Why didn't you tell me this before?

38:22.080 --> 38:24.600
-Didn't wanna spoil today.
-And this hasn't spoilt it?

38:24.680 --> 38:26.920
It was supposed to be five years,
but now...

38:27.000 --> 38:28.280
[exhales loudly]

38:28.360 --> 38:31.520
I looked at it, something happened,
it started going down.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.560
-I don't know what it was.
-So  you  broke it?

38:33.640 --> 38:36.640
No, no, no, no, no.
I mean, I don't... I don't know.

38:36.720 --> 38:37.920
Why did you have to look at it?

38:38.400 --> 38:41.120
Look, I was thinking maybe
we could overcome it somehow.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.600
Why did you have to look at it?

38:43.680 --> 38:45.000
-Because I like you.
-[sighs]

38:45.080 --> 38:46.840
Like properly, really, I like you.

38:46.920 --> 38:50.800
-For fuck's sake. And that wasn't enough?
-That's not the point.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.720
-I looked, but that's not the issue here.
-Are you sure about that?

38:54.160 --> 38:56.560
You're more wound up about that
than how short the time is.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.880
Yes, because we had agreed.

38:58.960 --> 39:02.000
-Listen. Listen. Listen.
-[Amy exhales]

39:02.080 --> 39:04.000
-What if we just ignore it?
-We can't.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.720
Listen, we'll just fuck the system.
We'll fuck it--

39:06.800 --> 39:10.160
-And do what?
-We'll jump out, over the wall, get out.

39:10.240 --> 39:14.400
-There is nothing out there.
-How d'you know? How d'you know?

39:18.280 --> 39:19.800
-Amy...
-You've ruined this.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.480
You've ruined it.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.640
-Hey, it's nothing.
-[taser crackles]

39:27.560 --> 39:29.240
-Amy.
-Don't follow me.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.280
[Frank] Amy, I'm sorry.

39:35.560 --> 39:36.440
[Frank] Amy.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.520
-[device]  Everything happens for a reason.
-[crying] What reason?

39:41.600 --> 39:43.640
[device]  The system will be assessing
your reaction

39:43.720 --> 39:47.160
to the painful premature termination
of a treasured relationship

39:47.600 --> 39:51.600
and will adjust and improve its profile
of your eventual chosen one accordingly.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.440
-[sniffs] You're a great comfort.
-[device]  Thank you.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.840
[cries]

40:00.560 --> 40:04.640
I swear to God,
I feel like scaling the wall out there

40:04.720 --> 40:06.840
and jumping in the fucking wilderness.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.440
[device]  That would contravene the rules
of the system.

40:09.520 --> 40:13.680
Oh, the fucking system. [sniffs]

40:14.080 --> 40:17.520
[device]  Failure to comply with the system
may result in banishment.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.480
[shouts] All right, I know.

40:19.560 --> 40:23.120
Christ, will you let me be angry at least?
Will you give me that?

40:23.680 --> 40:24.680
[sniffs]

40:25.160 --> 40:29.080
[device]  You must vacate your current
living quarters when the time expires.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.000
Like I didn't know.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.000
[sighs]

40:34.640 --> 40:35.920
[sniffs]

42:19.080 --> 42:22.200
And if I hadn't have looked,
we'd have been together years.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.080
She was...

42:25.600 --> 42:31.320
You know when you meet someone
and you just know? You just know that...

42:31.400 --> 42:34.680
Reckon you could pop this in me now?
I've sort of got jaw ache.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.000
Yeah, come on.

42:36.080 --> 42:41.880
And after all that,
he never even apologized, not once.

42:43.280 --> 42:44.520
That's too bad.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.760
Do you mind if I think about her?

42:52.200 --> 42:53.560
If I can think about him?

42:54.600 --> 42:55.680
Yeah, sound.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.280
[panting]

43:06.360 --> 43:08.680
[headboard bangs on wall]

43:08.760 --> 43:10.840
One, two, three, four.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.840
One, two, three, four.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.040
[exhales]

43:33.280 --> 43:35.360
[device chimes]

43:37.080 --> 43:40.760
[device]  Congratulations, Amy.
Your ultimate match has been identified.

43:40.840 --> 43:42.600
Your pairing day is tomorrow.

43:42.680 --> 43:45.560
-Ultimate as in "the one"?
-[device]  That is correct.

43:45.640 --> 43:48.920
-And we meet tomorrow?
-[device]  That is correct.

43:49.840 --> 43:52.560
Tomorrow you'll be coupled
with your ultimate match

43:52.640 --> 43:55.200
and together
you will leave this place forever.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.160
OK. [exhales]

43:57.920 --> 44:00.120
Are you allowed
to tell me anything about them?

44:00.200 --> 44:03.160
-Do I know them already?
-[device]  Negative.

44:04.280 --> 44:06.480
-Right.
-[device]  There is one more thing.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.680
Yeah, and what's that?

44:08.160 --> 44:11.400
[device]  Prior to pairing day, you have
been allocated a short farewell period

44:11.480 --> 44:13.280
with an individual of your choosing.

44:13.360 --> 44:16.080
A farewell period?
Like, I get to say goodbye to someone?

44:16.160 --> 44:17.640
[device]  That is correct.

44:17.720 --> 44:20.320
Data shows this can help provide
psychological closure.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.120
Frank, I choose Frank.

44:22.800 --> 44:25.000
[device]  Your choice has been registered.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.120
Wait. Where are we meeting?

44:33.200 --> 44:35.720
[device]  Usual booth, 7:30 p.m.

44:35.800 --> 44:36.800
Right.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.600
-Coach?
-[device]  Yes, Amy?

44:42.680 --> 44:43.840
Count to four.

44:45.760 --> 44:48.160
[device]  One, two, three, four.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.800
[Frank] Wait, wait. How long have we got?

45:16.440 --> 45:18.320
[beeping]

45:18.400 --> 45:21.560
-[slams table]
-[beeping continues]

45:21.640 --> 45:24.360
Look, the system's set
my pairing day for tomorrow.

45:24.440 --> 45:26.160
-Yeah, me too.
-Right.

45:26.240 --> 45:29.760
I don't want whoever the system
reckons the one is, OK?

45:29.840 --> 45:31.120
-I want you.
-I want you.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.000
[device]  Failure to comply with the system

45:33.080 --> 45:34.760
-may result in banishment.
-You can fuck off.

45:35.440 --> 45:38.120
Can you remember where you were
before you came here?

45:38.200 --> 45:39.760
[device beeping]

45:39.840 --> 45:41.120
You can't, can you?

45:42.920 --> 45:44.280
-No.
-Me neither.

45:44.880 --> 45:47.360
-Why can't I think of that?
-It's a test.

45:48.080 --> 45:51.760
Do you remember the first night
that we were together? How did you feel?

45:53.840 --> 45:57.000
I felt safe, happy, comfortable.

45:57.840 --> 46:03.240
It felt right. It felt like something
locked into place, like we'd met before.

46:03.320 --> 46:05.440
Like it had happened before
and it'll happen again,

46:05.520 --> 46:08.200
like it's happened a thousand times
over and over again.

46:08.280 --> 46:11.280
-Do you know what I mean?
-Yeah. Yeah, I do.

46:11.680 --> 46:14.160
Ever since we've met,
this world has been toying with us.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.520
It's trying to keep us apart. It's...

46:16.600 --> 46:18.040
It's a test, I swear it is,

46:18.120 --> 46:22.120
and the two of us rebelling together
is something to do with passing it.

46:23.440 --> 46:25.600
-We've gotta fuck it all off.
-[laughs]

46:25.680 --> 46:28.360
Exactly. We've just gotta
fuck the whole thing off and go.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.520
-Yeah, over the wall.
-Right over it.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.760
-No matter what's out there.
-OK.

46:32.840 --> 46:34.200
[device beeping]

46:34.280 --> 46:35.840
So let's go.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.720
Yeah, let's go.

46:43.760 --> 46:46.520
[beeping continues]

46:46.600 --> 46:48.160
[device chimes and falls silent]

[crackling stops]

47:59.680 --> 48:01.760
[panting]

48:11.200 --> 48:12.600
[Amy] Come on.
